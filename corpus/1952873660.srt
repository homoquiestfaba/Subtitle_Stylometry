1
00:00:01,315 --> 00:00:03,465
The following tapes were found
Lichtenstein at the abandoned hospital

2
00:00:03,483 --> 00:00:04,654
For insane convicts

3
00:00:04,951 --> 00:00:07,203
... also with 14 bodies.

4
00:00:12,759 --> 00:00:14,659
My name is Amelia Wallace

5
00:00:16,029 --> 00:00:18,042
I'm being imprisoned against my will

6
00:00:19,966 --> 00:00:22,696
I've been hit
brutally

7
00:00:23,737 --> 00:00:24,817
Abused

8
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:28,451
Calateas

9
00:00:29,076 --> 00:00:31,237
my voice ... my dignity

10
00:00:32,713 --> 00:00:35,341
Please, if you're watching

11
00:00:36,316 --> 00:00:40,719
We need your help
have to come, must come

12
00:00:41,054 --> 00:00:42,658
Please

13
00:00:49,429 --> 00:00:51,112
Well, anytime

14
00:00:51,865 --> 00:00:53,674
- Are you ready?
- Yes. - Action

15
00:00:54,801 --> 00:00:59,488
Hello my name is Amelia Wallace
and I have 24 years

16
00:00:59,506 --> 00:01:02,213
And I live in California

17
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:10,789
I think this is something obscure here
Do you think you could burn out?

18
00:01:12,519 --> 00:01:16,728
- I want you to leave everything nice.
- You are all a diva

19
00:01:19,226 --> 00:01:20,579
I want my close-up

20
00:01:21,928 --> 00:01:23,668
Hello my name is Amelia Wallace

21
00:01:24,398 --> 00:01:29,279
And I have 24 years
I live in the wonderful California

22
00:01:31,405 --> 00:01:32,622
Do I think that is better than you think?

23
00:01:33,907 --> 00:01:37,764
- Come on, you know it's perfect.
- Well, it

24
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:42,298
I lead a simple life, or at least try

25
00:01:42,315 --> 00:01:44,249
This is my kitchen

26
00:01:46,153 --> 00:01:47,643
My outdoor shower

27
00:01:49,589 --> 00:01:52,092
This is my house, or whatever you call it

28
00:01:52,726 --> 00:01:56,856
I say home
She is my daughter Asher

29
00:01:56,863 --> 00:01:58,091
Say hello to the camera daughter

30
00:01:59,065 --> 00:02:02,330
She is the center of my world
is ...

31
00:02:03,003 --> 00:02:04,823
The only love of my life

32
00:02:05,238 --> 00:02:08,947
I work here at the hostel Kapinga
for battered women

33
00:02:10,043 --> 00:02:11,101
Work here 5 days a week

34
00:02:11,111 --> 00:02:14,387
Documenting evidence against
people who hurt these women

35
00:02:15,916 --> 00:02:18,077
Also if you need comfort
a shoulder to mourn

36
00:02:19,252 --> 00:02:23,780
I cook, I clean everything
need to return to duty

37
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:29,251
It is the most rewarding job
I've ever had

38
00:02:30,464 --> 00:02:34,127
So as you can imagine
my work is well paid

39
00:02:35,035 --> 00:02:38,903
I have a nanny 5 days a week
and I will not be able to pay

40
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:43,466
I'm going nowhere ... fast

41
00:02:45,045 --> 00:02:45,886
Y. ..

42
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:52,306
Despite all that Asher
has been diagnosed with neurofibromatosis

43
00:02:55,422 --> 00:02:57,026
Now is good, but ...

44
00:02:57,691 --> 00:03:02,606
The tumor will grow and do not know how I will pay ...

45
00:03:04,498 --> 00:03:09,026
So ... this is a weekend
in my life

46
00:03:09,736 --> 00:03:12,318
The good, the bad and the ugly

47
00:03:12,305 --> 00:03:15,194
And my lovely cameraman Will

48
00:03:15,675 --> 00:03:17,836
Recorded all

49
00:03:18,311 --> 00:03:21,576
To see if you are like me
a candidate worth

50
00:03:21,581 --> 00:03:23,788
For your program

51
00:03:25,151 --> 00:03:28,416
I need a dramatic start
and I need one now

52
00:03:30,156 --> 00:03:32,533
I also need to pay $ 20000

53
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,639
I think it's okay, we can cut

54
00:03:37,531 --> 00:03:41,012
I like nature and explore

55
00:03:41,001 --> 00:03:42,992
We ... if

56
00:03:44,704 --> 00:03:48,822
Thank God we have a neighbor with a pool

57
00:03:48,842 --> 00:03:51,151
Because Asher likes to swim

58
00:03:57,517 --> 00:03:58,825
Give a kiss to the camera

59
00:04:02,656 --> 00:04:03,509
Love

60
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:07,768
Even I have insurance

61
00:04:08,261 --> 00:04:09,910
What if I enter the program?

62
00:04:10,497 --> 00:04:12,215
How can I ever survive

63
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,339
Everything will be alright, gonna be alright

64
00:04:18,572 --> 00:04:20,085
Listen I have an idea

65
00:04:21,308 --> 00:04:22,354
What about going to see Susy

66
00:04:22,342 --> 00:04:24,606
I'll make you open your mind

67
00:04:24,978 --> 00:04:28,027
It changes your life and make you safer
I promise

68
00:04:28,381 --> 00:04:30,099
I want to help and this is
the best way to

69
00:04:31,051 --> 00:04:33,053
Welcome here

70
00:04:33,687 --> 00:04:37,896
I came here alone, we are about
to see my friend Susy

71
00:04:38,725 --> 00:04:42,604
Cree who can help me
feed my confidence

72
00:04:43,296 --> 00:04:45,867
And self esteem and as I said things like

73
00:04:46,499 --> 00:04:48,683
So let's see

74
00:04:48,969 --> 00:04:53,110
She is Susy, or known Says
well in some circles

75
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:57,483
We grew up together in Florida
we have different lifestyles

76
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:59,341
And we are in the same place

77
00:04:59,346 --> 00:05:02,838
We are ready to try anything

78
00:05:05,852 --> 00:05:07,740
Stand straight, look
up, shoulders back

79
00:05:09,122 --> 00:05:12,762
You have to move well

80
00:05:13,693 --> 00:05:17,732
- Are you ready for the show?
- It's time to start

81
00:05:30,377 --> 00:05:31,355
Mira and

82
00:05:53,366 --> 00:05:54,128
Carefully

83
00:05:55,001 --> 00:05:58,744
Lift your foot and put it there
and dance, downhill

84
00:06:21,027 --> 00:06:22,460
So you have to walk

85
00:06:24,631 --> 00:06:25,632
Let

86
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,748
Cabinet

87
00:06:56,696 --> 00:06:59,153
You have to dress appropriately

88
00:07:01,935 --> 00:07:02,924
Let

89
00:07:28,294 --> 00:07:32,071
- What's with the camera?
- It's for quality control

90
00:07:33,433 --> 00:07:36,175
Sounds kinda naughty, what's your name?

91
00:07:36,202 --> 00:07:39,763
- Amelia.
- Amelia

92
00:07:40,874 --> 00:07:43,229
- That nice name.
- I come with Says

93
00:07:43,543 --> 00:07:48,378
Says "? What name is that?
Is the name that works

94
00:07:48,414 --> 00:07:53,192
- Back, I'm shooting
- So better watch my back

95
00:07:53,453 --> 00:07:56,331
- Why?
- How to that?

96
00:07:57,223 --> 00:07:58,599
What do you think if you kiss?

97
00:08:04,097 --> 00:08:09,023
- That it will cost. "I'm warning usare
this as evidence against you in court

98
00:08:12,205 --> 00:08:13,638
That scares me

99
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:19,992
How appropriate bed

100
00:08:22,482 --> 00:08:25,030
Where I'm going to fuck now

101
00:08:26,886 --> 00:08:29,366
- What happens?
- Try this

102
00:08:31,157 --> 00:08:34,797
- Let
- The money is good

103
00:08:35,862 --> 00:08:40,026
That used to pay rent

104
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:45,252
You earn $ 500 a night a little
more when special events

105
00:08:45,505 --> 00:08:48,190
And even if you are good
like me

106
00:08:48,174 --> 00:08:51,860
- I wonder how a week ago.
- Asher

107
00:08:51,878 --> 00:08:56,793
Now you only have 2 ½ years
but I want you to know

108
00:08:56,816 --> 00:09:01,753
What I'm about to do
I do it for you

109
00:09:02,722 --> 00:09:04,383
Everything I do I do for you

110
00:09:06,759 --> 00:09:09,000
This is not me, not me
feel comfortable with this

111
00:09:10,263 --> 00:09:11,707
But I need the money

112
00:09:14,367 --> 00:09:15,743
Well

113
00:09:19,606 --> 00:09:22,495
I can not do this
no. . I can not

114
00:09:22,742 --> 00:09:25,097
We just went through this

115
00:09:25,712 --> 00:09:29,159
Let you look sexy, enjoy

116
00:09:29,449 --> 00:09:30,973
Is all that matters

117
00:09:34,487 --> 00:09:37,251
- Are the nude?
- Ballerina. - Whatever.

118
00:09:37,657 --> 00:09:41,570
Who is your partner?
Gipsy dance free, I am your representative

119
00:09:42,095 --> 00:09:44,177
The camera is for
quality control

120
00:09:48,935 --> 00:09:51,153
Do not worry, you'll see the show

121
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:53,047
It better be well

122
00:09:56,109 --> 00:09:58,191
Do not bother, go ahead

123
00:10:07,754 --> 00:10:08,800
Come on baby

124
00:10:08,821 --> 00:10:13,781
Froze, it's time for plan B

125
00:10:21,935 --> 00:10:24,665
They look very naughty boys

126
00:10:32,578 --> 00:10:36,264
Looks like I'll have to put a good

127
00:10:36,282 --> 00:10:38,261
Punishment

128
00:12:08,474 --> 00:12:09,315
What's happening?

129
00:12:24,524 --> 00:12:28,119
- You scared.

130
00:12:28,594 --> 00:12:31,802
- I freeze.
- If that saw all

131
00:12:32,932 --> 00:12:34,399
You're the worst

132
00:12:36,402 --> 00:12:38,142
I forget the character

133
00:12:38,604 --> 00:12:41,653
- But it started well.

Take your pay is $ 500

00:12:48,714 --> 00:12:50,386

- Yes, yes

137
00:12:52,285 --> 00:12:55,049
- God, as it wins

It is for the 20 minutes of work

00:12:58,357 --> 00:13:00,018
- No way.
- Do you want to do it again?

140
00:13:00,326 --> 00:13:03,727
- Yes.
- If it sounds

141
00:13:05,398 --> 00:13:07,229
I'm finished, I exceeded my limits

312
00:31:22,294 --> 00:31:23,488
Do not know

Says the truth is the first step

315
00:31:31,670 --> 00:31:35,572
A complete purification
and to eternal salvation

316
00:31:36,308 --> 00:31:40,893
Without truth, how can there be salvation

Many cultures believe that fasting
is the first step in the purification

320
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:09,625
I agree

321
00:32:09,641 --> 00:32:13,554
As you can achieve the purity of the soul

322
00:32:14,579 --> 00:32:15,967

I believe God
is a great man

333
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:38,406
Take for testing

334
00:33:38,697 --> 00:33:40,221

335
00:33:43,301 --> 00:33:47,340

What the hell?

341
00:34:09,828 --> 00:34:12,388
What makes these people here?

342
00:34:22,207 --> 00:34:23,788

00:36:18,857 --> 00:36:23,806
I hear it every second
each day, I hear

362
00:36:23,795 --> 00:36:27,322
I will not stay to be
abused for 2 months

363
00:36:32,871 --> 00:36:36,409
Come on. . I need you

364
00:36:56,494 --> 00:36:58,985
What happens?

You have to do whatever

370
00:37:25,890 --> 00:37:27,949
This is a curse

371
00:37:27,959 --> 00:37:30,928
You have to bring help

372
00:37:32,463 --> 00:37:33,703
Thanks

373
00:37:34,799 --> 00:37:37,484
Watch your back

You have to go to college

375
00:37:41,906 --> 00:37:44,591
I wanted to be a professional

376
00:37:45,310 --> 00:37:47,483
Watch finish

377
00:37:47,946 --> 00:37:51,325

My son. .

00:37:55,753 --> 00:37:58,483
Everything will be fine

I need to shoot this

Beat us, I just want to go home

392
00:38:50,742 --> 00:38:52,494
Calm down, it

393
00:38:54,946 --> 00:38:57,813
They are so close

394
00:39:00,018 --> 00:39:01,076
A damn penny

395
00:39:09,394 --> 00:39:10,907
Let's see how the ladies are

396
00:39:12,397 --> 00:39:14,422
At night

397
00:39:26,944 --> 00:39:27,740
Have been

398
00:39:32,483 --> 00:39:36,658
The escaped prisoners
"Where are they?

399
00:39:37,555 --> 00:39:38,487
Shit

400
00:39:58,976 --> 00:39:59,795
Shit

401
00:40:01,512 --> 00:40:03,332
Here come

402
00:40:10,555 --> 00:40:11,374
Turn off the camera

403
00:40:12,857 --> 00:40:15,701
We have to burn this place
So

404
00:40:20,164 --> 00:40:21,142
Run, run

405
00:40:26,637 --> 00:40:28,377
Run, run, run

406
00:40:31,576 --> 00:40:33,112
Does God they're going to do?

407
00:40:33,678 --> 00:40:35,612
Calm everything will be fine

408
00:40:38,850 --> 00:40:41,660
- Shit

409
00:40:44,522 --> 00:40:45,443
Come in, come

410
00:41:21,259 --> 00:41:23,727
God
- Run, run

411
00:41:24,796 --> 00:41:25,956
Here

412
00:41:25,963 --> 00:41:29,251
And now that we are closed

413
00:41:30,234 --> 00:41:32,282
Mira must return

414
00:41:38,776 --> 00:41:39,811
Please God

415
00:41:41,012 --> 00:41:42,047
Is closed

416
00:41:44,649 --> 00:41:45,820
I do not know

417
00:41:54,292 --> 00:41:55,725
What we do

418
00:41:56,694 --> 00:41:57,968
You are here

419
00:41:59,263 --> 00:42:00,525
Shit

420
00:42:08,806 --> 00:42:10,080
It seems that passed through here

421
00:42:31,362 --> 00:42:32,203
Beautiful

422
00:42:42,173 --> 00:42:44,107
It seems that this does not hurt

423
00:42:44,742 --> 00:42:46,892
- Take her surgery
- NO

424
00:42:54,485 --> 00:42:56,897
That disappointment

425
00:43:12,803 --> 00:43:16,273
The lust of
dirty body to soul

426
00:43:17,909 --> 00:43:20,582
The road to purity is long

427
00:43:22,213 --> 00:43:24,647
But you would think
happened if I had not found

428
00:43:25,616 --> 00:43:29,598
You'll thank me for this
in a few years

429
00:43:31,422 --> 00:43:34,471
We tested the purity of your soul
and failed

430
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:39,878
Then we will kindly

431
00:43:39,897 --> 00:43:42,650
Clean the bad ideas in your head

432
00:43:46,637 --> 00:43:49,515
- Start
- No, no, no, please

433
00:43:49,941 --> 00:43:52,216
Please no, no, no

434
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:58,186
No, no, no

435
00:43:59,083 --> 00:44:00,448
No. ..

436
00:44:37,254 --> 00:44:40,781
Look at me I'm a victim

437
00:45:08,652 --> 00:45:09,653
Cent

438
00:45:11,055 --> 00:45:12,591
Help me please

439
00:45:27,104 --> 00:45:28,446
Please do not leave me

440
00:45:28,973 --> 00:45:32,534
I left the door open as usual

441
00:45:32,576 --> 00:45:36,319
Do not go, we can not escape

442
00:45:37,615 --> 00:45:39,594
- What are you doing?
- Trying to escape

443
00:45:40,851 --> 00:45:42,057
I'll get help

444
00:45:42,053 --> 00:45:44,578
Meanwhile, do what you say

445
00:45:44,588 --> 00:45:46,931
While you do if you'll be fine

446
00:45:48,292 --> 00:45:53,184
Do not leave me, for you'll be back
I'll be back for you

447
00:45:53,531 --> 00:45:55,123
I promise

448
00:45:57,968 --> 00:46:00,664
Do not leave me, I will return, it

449
00:46:42,613 --> 00:46:46,162
Watch this naughty rat

450
00:46:59,263 --> 00:47:01,970
You like to get in my kitchen

451
00:47:05,369 --> 00:47:06,848
Goodbye

452
00:47:37,801 --> 00:47:38,870
God is Tara

453
00:47:38,903 --> 00:47:41,189
Are you ready for your final exam?

454
00:47:43,574 --> 00:47:47,658
Well, we have 5 more to save souls

455
00:47:49,313 --> 00:47:50,484
When you're ready

456
00:48:02,259 --> 00:48:05,387
My God, shit

457
00:48:06,597 --> 00:48:07,803
My God

458
00:48:59,116 --> 00:48:59,980
Shit

459
00:49:37,588 --> 00:49:38,464
Shit

460
00:50:07,785 --> 00:50:09,924
$ 150,000 for travel

461
00:50:11,021 --> 00:50:13,967
I can afford.
The need

462
00:50:13,991 --> 00:50:17,301
To meet your needs
psychiatric and medical

463
00:50:18,562 --> 00:50:23,078
Like a great ocean,
as a consolation prize

464
00:50:24,435 --> 00:50:26,596
And if you do not take money

465
00:50:50,594 --> 00:50:52,323
You are an ungrateful bitch

466
00:50:53,063 --> 00:50:54,405
After all I did for you

467
00:50:55,099 --> 00:51:00,048
You could not have been grateful
we could have gone together to the sky

468
00:51:00,604 --> 00:51:02,208
To save

469
00:51:02,206 --> 00:51:05,937
But now you look terrible, again

470
00:51:06,610 --> 00:51:10,432
Except this time no
purify you

471
00:51:25,696 --> 00:51:27,175
God

472
00:51:29,833 --> 00:51:32,324
Will ... Will

473
00:51:33,771 --> 00:51:36,308
Sorry

474
00:51:56,994 --> 00:51:58,541
God

475
00:52:00,931 --> 00:52:02,296
I will put the camera here

476
00:52:56,620 --> 00:52:57,348
So ...

477
00:52:59,423 --> 00:53:03,450
That brings. . Says

478
00:53:04,228 --> 00:53:06,276
Do not call me Says

479
00:53:07,264 --> 00:53:10,062
I'm not stripper should not be here

480
00:53:10,467 --> 00:53:14,892
I think the opposite Says
you should be here

481
00:53:15,606 --> 00:53:16,891
Certainly

482
00:53:18,842 --> 00:53:22,812
I must say
that are different from other

483
00:53:24,848 --> 00:53:28,352
I feel a strange connection to you

484
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:31,062
Connection that can help

485
00:53:32,990 --> 00:53:34,048
You know what I mean?

486
00:53:35,826 --> 00:53:38,192
The connection can save you can save

487
00:53:39,830 --> 00:53:41,047
Several

488
00:53:48,438 --> 00:53:52,989
If you back spiders I shall scratch yours

489
00:53:56,246 --> 00:53:59,500
What happened to you?

490
00:54:01,184 --> 00:54:06,156
I think you should for your sins
behave much better

491
00:54:07,925 --> 00:54:10,428
And if you want to give you money

492
00:54:11,628 --> 00:54:13,584
To save your life

493
00:54:18,535 --> 00:54:20,856
The choice is yours

494
00:54:43,126 --> 00:54:44,616
What do you say?

495
00:54:45,128 --> 00:54:46,527
You have to show commitment

496
00:54:51,134 --> 00:54:52,670
So

497
00:55:14,625 --> 00:55:17,640
You have not learned anything

498
00:55:17,628 --> 00:55:19,914
Damn filthy stripper

499
00:55:22,799 --> 00:55:24,312
Sédenla

500
00:55:27,237 --> 00:55:28,454
No,

501
00:55:32,542 --> 00:55:36,569
Just a little
have to be awake

502
00:55:37,414 --> 00:55:39,882
You have to know what is happening
and see what happens

503
00:55:41,151 --> 00:55:45,133
You have to feel the pain
You have to free yourself from sin

504
00:55:45,122 --> 00:55:48,603
Both body and your soul
have to be pure

505
00:55:48,625 --> 00:55:51,196
In both

506
00:55:53,597 --> 00:55:55,633
Let me

507
00:55:59,336 --> 00:56:00,644
Why I do this?

508
00:56:03,273 --> 00:56:05,002
After all I've done

509
00:56:05,876 --> 00:56:08,492
"And mean this?

510
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:11,861
No love

511
00:56:15,952 --> 00:56:17,624
You gotta see this

512
00:56:20,157 --> 00:56:23,604
So you can remember

513
00:56:24,695 --> 00:56:27,380
So when it is back feel

514
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:33,156
I want help

515
00:56:36,907 --> 00:56:37,817
I have to fix this

516
00:56:41,545 --> 00:56:42,967
I'm proud of you

517
00:56:45,916 --> 00:56:48,714
People are witnessing a change

518
00:56:52,189 --> 00:56:54,931
Time for me to stay on earth
is dedicated to helping others

519
00:56:56,226 --> 00:56:59,605
For good
with this all will be pure

520
00:57:00,797 --> 00:57:02,333
And I will continue helping others

521
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:07,436
Now ... I'm gonna take your genitals
- No

522
00:57:08,538 --> 00:57:10,790
Look

523
00:57:19,049 --> 00:57:23,782
I'll give you a little motivation
to no longer follow sin

524
00:57:24,121 --> 00:57:25,531
Against the will of God

525
00:57:27,691 --> 00:57:30,091
This will help

526
00:57:31,561 --> 00:57:34,007
This is against God's will

527
00:57:34,397 --> 00:57:35,398
Not for me

528
00:57:36,466 --> 00:57:38,741
Then who?

529
00:57:40,203 --> 00:57:41,215
Short

530
00:58:27,617 --> 00:58:29,175
We have a sangrona

531
00:58:31,254 --> 00:58:33,085
Is there a doctor in the room?

532
00:58:37,494 --> 00:58:38,518
You'll be happy to know

533
00:58:38,862 --> 00:58:41,774
Your operation until
Now is a hit

534
00:58:43,066 --> 00:58:46,103
Now we have the other ovary

535
00:58:47,037 --> 00:58:49,050
And presto

536
00:59:01,518 --> 00:59:02,997
There are many bad

537
00:59:03,019 --> 00:59:05,601
In all my working life I

538
00:59:18,935 --> 00:59:19,731
Today

539
00:59:21,671 --> 00:59:23,730
I had a good day

540
00:59:38,555 --> 00:59:40,989
This is where my journey begins

541
01:00:12,856 --> 01:00:14,130
Good morning

542
01:00:15,258 --> 01:00:18,796
You should not be bleeding

543
01:00:22,699 --> 01:00:23,643
Keep bleeding

544
01:00:25,702 --> 01:00:29,456
Did you know that the road
This purification was

545
01:00:30,874 --> 01:00:31,909
Are you ready?

546
01:00:33,677 --> 01:00:36,453
I have cooked so much that I can not urinate

547
01:00:37,814 --> 01:00:39,770
Enough but you

548
01:00:39,783 --> 01:00:42,957
Everything is to cleanse you of your sins

549
01:00:45,555 --> 01:00:47,227
Anything else you want to tell?

550
01:00:49,092 --> 01:00:51,060
- I'm ready.
- Ready for what?

551
01:00:51,394 --> 01:00:54,397
Ready for trial and not

552
01:00:57,600 --> 01:01:01,343
I had time to
think of my sins y. ..

553
01:01:05,008 --> 01:01:08,978
My sin, my body and soul

554
01:01:10,046 --> 01:01:12,958
I also prayed a lot

555
01:01:13,583 --> 01:01:17,861
Y. . the great lord
has shown me that. .

556
01:01:20,857 --> 01:01:22,518
Have been helping me all this time

557
01:01:23,827 --> 01:01:25,533
To purify

558
01:01:29,032 --> 01:01:32,195
And now I accept it

559
01:01:34,971 --> 01:01:36,586
So tell the great man ...

560
01:01:39,876 --> 01:01:42,948
I think I'm free
of moral sins

561
01:01:45,749 --> 01:01:47,159
And ready for final test

562
01:01:50,387 --> 01:01:51,388
No matter what!

563
01:01:59,329 --> 01:02:00,808
This is boring

564
01:02:01,631 --> 01:02:04,418
The last time I try
Clean the stripper and the fags

565
01:02:04,434 --> 01:02:06,334
Proved a fiasco

566
01:02:44,707 --> 01:02:45,890
This is more comfortable

567
01:02:49,612 --> 01:02:50,806
So we will

568
01:03:22,145 --> 01:03:23,931
This is for the pain

569
01:03:32,155 --> 01:03:33,065
You can go

570
01:03:33,423 --> 01:03:34,469
if

571
01:04:17,634 --> 01:04:22,594
Dear sir, my final penance
will sacrifice

572
01:04:25,108 --> 01:04:27,258
Then I will see the great man

573
01:04:27,277 --> 01:04:29,541
Let me at the sky

574
01:04:31,080 --> 01:04:32,160
In her arms

575
01:04:35,418 --> 01:04:39,070
Take fire girls

576
01:04:39,389 --> 01:04:41,926
To find their way

577
01:04:42,825 --> 01:04:45,146
To purify

578
01:04:48,731 --> 01:04:49,959
Final pretrial

579
01:04:51,834 --> 01:04:54,610
Veras purity

580
01:04:54,637 --> 01:04:58,653
and I have access to your kingdom
no doubt

581
01:05:00,443 --> 01:05:01,922
Without pain or suffering

582
01:05:02,779 --> 01:05:05,179
For all my sins

583
01:05:09,185 --> 01:05:12,313
And instead of income
the kingdom of heaven

584
01:05:13,723 --> 01:05:16,283
I will go to the ultimate test

585
01:05:18,161 --> 01:05:19,879
To achieve good

586
01:05:21,464 --> 01:05:25,036
for before your eyes
deserve your kingdom

587
01:05:25,368 --> 01:05:27,689
A trip without the pain

588
01:05:28,538 --> 01:05:30,028
Neither suffering

589
01:05:32,542 --> 01:05:36,205
I ask you sir
to let them return

590
01:05:37,480 --> 01:05:39,584
And do go through the large doors

591
01:05:40,483 --> 01:05:41,689
And entering the kingdom

592
01:05:43,019 --> 01:05:47,206
No matter ... their sins

593
01:05:53,396 --> 01:05:54,249
Amen

594
01:07:44,407 --> 01:07:45,305
I'm finished

595
01:07:51,581 --> 01:07:52,445
It is time

596
01:08:22,078 --> 01:08:23,261
Please

597
01:08:24,046 --> 01:08:24,831
Take a seat

598
01:08:46,369 --> 01:08:47,290
Says

599
01:08:49,605 --> 01:08:52,665
It is time, to make a decision

600
01:08:54,444 --> 01:08:56,651
Life is full of difficult decisions

601
01:08:58,781 --> 01:09:01,750
For example
"I chose to be a stripper?

602
01:09:03,286 --> 01:09:04,014
Or not?

603
01:09:05,488 --> 01:09:08,719
"I choose to have a life of pleasure immoral?

604
01:09:09,759 --> 01:09:11,033
Or not?

605
01:09:12,361 --> 01:09:16,195
Peco "or love God?

606
01:09:19,335 --> 01:09:21,144
What you choose is clear

607
01:09:22,805 --> 01:09:25,399
But I'm not here to judge

608
01:09:26,642 --> 01:09:28,598
I realized I had a life

609
01:09:30,346 --> 01:09:31,187
Full of sins

610
01:09:33,883 --> 01:09:37,922
18 months ago
I work closely with ...

611
01:09:38,888 --> 01:09:40,037
One of your class

612
01:09:41,991 --> 01:09:43,959
Do not make me remind you

613
01:09:46,462 --> 01:09:49,545
A message, crude but appropriate

614
01:09:54,003 --> 01:09:55,368
So I want to help

615
01:09:56,873 --> 01:09:58,431
I like you Says

616
01:09:59,408 --> 01:10:01,262
So Hail

617
01:10:01,611 --> 01:10:03,772
And I made you suffer so much

618
01:10:04,380 --> 01:10:07,304
With my hard work and your suffering

619
01:10:08,050 --> 01:10:10,018
We assure a place where ...

620
01:10:10,019 --> 01:10:12,067
No pain

621
01:10:14,323 --> 01:10:15,574
If you want it

622
01:10:21,297 --> 01:10:23,458
$ 150,000 in cash

623
01:10:24,467 --> 01:10:25,434
Are yours

624
01:10:28,804 --> 01:10:30,635
- If you want them
- Are they for real?

625
01:10:30,973 --> 01:10:32,474
If

626
01:10:33,776 --> 01:10:34,765
Are yours

627
01:10:37,013 --> 01:10:37,945
If you choose

628
01:10:52,962 --> 01:10:54,418
Very nice, very nice

629
01:11:00,903 --> 01:11:02,951
I think I was good at my job

630
01:11:03,973 --> 01:11:06,521
And I'm sure you took the decision

631
01:11:06,909 --> 01:11:10,697
If you want the money, all you have
to do is admit that you are stripper

632
01:11:11,080 --> 01:11:14,402
The alternative is to admit
here in this place

633
01:11:14,417 --> 01:11:18,786
God is my witness
you are pure in body, mind and soul

634
01:11:18,788 --> 01:11:21,074
And you will be free to go through that door

635
01:11:23,726 --> 01:11:25,557
And I'll be happy for my success

636
01:11:26,862 --> 01:11:29,148
- Happy?
- That you are free

637
01:11:29,465 --> 01:11:30,830
Mortal sin

638
01:11:37,406 --> 01:11:38,873
Let me take the money

639
01:11:39,475 --> 01:11:40,339
If

640
01:11:41,677 --> 01:11:44,578
Without condition

641
01:11:44,947 --> 01:11:48,155
But it meant that my job has failed

642
01:11:49,051 --> 01:11:51,997
I failed in my purpose

643
01:11:55,157 --> 01:11:59,344
But I need to know
Before proceeding, if you will continue with me

644
01:12:00,863 --> 01:12:02,080
Beside me

645
01:12:05,368 --> 01:12:06,505
Do I go from here?

646
01:12:09,372 --> 01:12:11,715
$ 150,000 to resolve your problems

647
01:12:13,542 --> 01:12:15,351
I can enable the I
and you need them

648
01:12:16,545 --> 01:12:20,299
To your health, your psychologist

649
01:12:20,316 --> 01:12:22,773
Be like a consolation prize

650
01:12:23,819 --> 01:12:26,640
But if you live here without money

651
01:12:30,059 --> 01:12:32,357
You will have health and wealth
beyond your imagination

652
01:12:43,739 --> 01:12:44,683
Have you taken any decision?

653
01:12:51,380 --> 01:12:52,358
Money

654
01:12:57,520 --> 01:12:59,636
So you admit you are still a stripper?

655
01:13:02,058 --> 01:13:03,298
Never said that

656
01:13:05,261 --> 01:13:08,970
Do you ask if you were a stripper?
and I said if it were

657
01:13:10,433 --> 01:13:11,900
I never said it was Stripper

658
01:13:12,768 --> 01:13:16,113
Admitted it only for
you would stop hurting

659
01:13:18,007 --> 01:13:21,795
I need to know, if you are pure
in body, mind and soul

660
01:13:21,811 --> 01:13:23,381
Or if you're a stripper

661
01:13:28,984 --> 01:13:30,269
Can you give me the money?

662
01:13:30,286 --> 01:13:34,006
Admit you are a stripper

663
01:13:43,699 --> 01:13:44,961
Try again

664
01:13:49,405 --> 01:13:50,281
Are you pure?

665
01:13:53,943 --> 01:13:55,103
Are you a stripper?

666
01:14:00,082 --> 01:14:02,528
- What you say?

667
01:14:02,885 --> 01:14:04,773

01:14:26,041 --> 01:14:28,316
I am ... not what you think

671
01:14:28,644 --> 01:14:30,509
Look what has

672
01:14:33,749 --> 01:14:34,898
Move

673
01:14:43,459 --> 01:14:45,074
Do not swim with men

674
01:14:45,361 --> 01:14:46,828
Or you'll regret

675
01:14:51,033 --> 01:14:53,581
Raise your hands

676
01:14:55,604 --> 01:14:59,096
What?
Are you scrub?

677
01:14:59,475 --> 01:15:01,807
Absolutely positive

678
01:15:13,055 --> 01:15:14,340
That's Will

679
01:15:16,225 --> 01:15:17,999
Ok, just take time

680
01:15:28,838 --> 01:15:30,089
Turn off the camera

681
01:15:40,349 --> 01:15:41,247
I have family

682
01:15:42,852 --> 01:15:44,001
I also

683
01:15:46,889 --> 01:15:48,993
Say hello

684
01:15:50,025 --> 01:15:52,311
Come on, a race to the sea

685
01:16:07,576 --> 01:16:11,478
After an anonymous sign 14 bodies were
Lichtenstein found in hospital

686
01:16:11,513 --> 01:16:14,209
Insane criminals

687
01:16:15,251 --> 01:16:19,108
The portfolio containing $ 150000
was never recovered

688
01:16:21,690 --> 01:16:25,751
Wallis and her daughter Amelia Asher vanishes in-
Cieron from his home in Topanga, without a trace

689
01:16:28,764 --> 01:16:32,643
Rahm Geever body, known
as the butcher was never found

690
01:16:36,405 --> 01:16:37,975
FBI investigations have found

01:16:37,973 --> 01:16:41,841
That work as a gynecologist Geever Rahm
in Baker, California between 193 - 2007

692
01:16:44,680 --> 01:16:49,265
At that time, mutilated
300 female genitals

693
01:16:51,453 --> 01:16:56,004
Geever always managed to evade
the system. It was never brought to trial

694
01:16:58,427 --> 01:17:02,261
The FBI believes it is likely
back to work.
