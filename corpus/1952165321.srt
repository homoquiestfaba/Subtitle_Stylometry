1
00:00:30,072 --> 00:00:32,032
When I look back on it,

2
00:00:32,074 --> 00:00:35,285
I still can't make sense
of how a normal kid like me

3
00:00:35,327 --> 00:00:38,121
ever wound up meeting
Buck Howard.

4
00:00:38,164 --> 00:00:39,956
When I was five years old,

5
00:00:39,999 --> 00:00:41,374
my dad asked me what
I wanted to be

6
00:00:41,417 --> 00:00:43,585
when I grew up.

7
00:00:43,627 --> 00:00:46,963
I said I wanted to drive
a steamroller and he said, "No,

8
00:00:47,006 --> 00:00:48,590
you want to be a lawyer."

9
00:00:48,632 --> 00:00:51,217
I said astronaut.
He said lawyer.

10
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:53,511
I said policeman.
He said lawyer.

11
00:00:53,554 --> 00:00:56,681
So we compromised... on lawyer,

12
00:00:56,724 --> 00:00:58,224
which is how, 20 years later,

13
00:00:58,267 --> 00:01:00,393
I ended up in law school.

14
00:01:00,436 --> 00:01:02,395
And even though
this was my father's dream,

15
00:01:02,438 --> 00:01:03,897
for the first couple of years

16
00:01:03,939 --> 00:01:05,440
I bought into the whole thing,

17
00:01:07,026 --> 00:01:08,818
until one day.

18
00:01:08,861 --> 00:01:12,155
I finished an exam early
and I just sat there thinking,

19
00:01:12,198 --> 00:01:15,950
thinking that somewhere
there must be somebody

20
00:01:15,993 --> 00:01:18,620
whose dream it is to be a lawyer,

21
00:01:18,662 --> 00:01:20,830
but after more than
two years in law school,

22
00:01:20,873 --> 00:01:23,166
I hadn't met a single one.

23
00:01:23,209 --> 00:01:26,461
And suddenly it occurred to me...

24
00:01:26,504 --> 00:01:28,046
I'm not happy.

25
00:01:28,089 --> 00:01:29,839
I gotta get out of here.

26
00:01:29,882 --> 00:01:31,508
So this moment right here

27
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:33,551
became my last chance
to stop everything,

28
00:01:33,594 --> 00:01:35,386
hit pause,

29
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:37,388
and find a dream
before it was too late.

30
00:01:37,431 --> 00:01:41,392
Late or not, it felt fantastic.

31
00:01:41,435 --> 00:01:44,479
Of course, I hadn't told
my father any of this,

32
00:01:44,522 --> 00:01:46,189
but I was pretty sure
that he'd understand.

33
00:01:46,232 --> 00:01:48,608
I just had to present my case.

34
00:01:48,651 --> 00:01:52,070
Hey, Dad. Well, school's tough.

35
00:01:52,113 --> 00:01:56,282
You know,
Contracts is really hard.

36
00:01:56,325 --> 00:01:59,702
See? I would have been
a terrible lawyer.

37
00:01:59,745 --> 00:02:01,371
The thrilling thing, though,

38
00:02:01,413 --> 00:02:04,040
is that now all I had were options.

39
00:02:04,083 --> 00:02:05,708
I could do anything I wanted.

40
00:02:05,751 --> 00:02:08,378
You name it,
I thought of being it.

41
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:10,421
I could be a private investigator,

42
00:02:10,464 --> 00:02:12,507
a test driver for NASCAR,

43
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:15,051
or a talk show host.

44
00:02:15,094 --> 00:02:17,345
How do you get
that job, anyway?

45
00:02:17,388 --> 00:02:20,098
The truth, though,
is that I did have an idea

46
00:02:20,141 --> 00:02:22,350
in the back of my head.

47
00:02:22,393 --> 00:02:25,728
I had always had this secret dream
of becoming a writer.

48
00:02:25,771 --> 00:02:28,398
And while I didn't know
how to get that job either,

49
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:31,109
I did have a pen and paper.

50
00:02:31,152 --> 00:02:33,528
So I just did what came naturally.

51
00:02:33,571 --> 00:02:35,613
And that's when I was hit
by something else...

52
00:02:35,656 --> 00:02:39,617
reality... the reality of having to
find something to do

53
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,828
to pay for little things
like food and rent,

54
00:02:41,871 --> 00:02:44,747
and getting my car fixed.
I had to find a job,

55
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:47,375
but who said it couldn't be
something with a little adventure,

56
00:02:47,418 --> 00:02:50,795
something with words like "celebrity"
and "performer" attached to it?

57
00:02:54,842 --> 00:02:56,342
And that's how it happened.

58
00:02:56,385 --> 00:02:58,845
That's how I found myself

59
00:02:58,888 --> 00:03:02,140
meeting the one and only
Great Buck Howard.

60
00:03:11,275 --> 00:03:12,775
You must be Troy.

61
00:03:12,818 --> 00:03:15,403
- I'm Gil.
- Oh, hi. I'm Troy.

62
00:03:15,446 --> 00:03:18,114
- Sorry I'm late.
- Relax. It's not a problem.

63
00:03:18,157 --> 00:03:19,741
Let's grab a seat.

64
00:03:21,243 --> 00:03:22,952
He should be here any minute.

65
00:03:22,995 --> 00:03:24,913
We were impressed
you'd been to law school.

66
00:03:24,955 --> 00:03:28,124
I should probably explain that. Uh...

67
00:03:28,167 --> 00:03:30,126
I didn't finish, actually.

68
00:03:30,169 --> 00:03:31,586
Good evening, Mr. Howard.

69
00:03:31,629 --> 00:03:32,962
Oh, here he is.

70
00:03:39,011 --> 00:03:41,054
Buck!

71
00:03:41,096 --> 00:03:43,181
Big Buck!

72
00:04:08,874 --> 00:04:10,375
I'm Buck Howard.

73
00:04:12,503 --> 00:04:14,504
Troy Gable.

74
00:04:14,546 --> 00:04:18,383
Young man, I am delighted
that you are interested in this job.

75
00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:21,010
I am very busy. I did over...

76
00:04:21,053 --> 00:04:22,845
One thought kept racing
through my mind as Buck talked...

77
00:04:22,888 --> 00:04:26,849
I had no idea who this guy was...

78
00:04:26,892 --> 00:04:28,851
and I guess it must have shown.

79
00:04:28,894 --> 00:04:31,396
You do know who I am, don't you?

80
00:04:31,438 --> 00:04:33,231
Uh...

81
00:04:33,274 --> 00:04:34,732
You have seen "The Tonight Show"?

82
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:37,652
You have to say "with Johnny Carson,"

83
00:04:37,695 --> 00:04:40,238
not the nitwit who's on there now.

84
00:04:40,281 --> 00:04:42,031
Buck did "The Tonight Show"...
with Johnny...

85
00:04:42,074 --> 00:04:44,033
61 times.

86
00:04:44,076 --> 00:04:47,704
I think...
you're a magician, right?

87
00:04:47,746 --> 00:04:49,372
Buck's a mentalist.

88
00:04:49,415 --> 00:04:51,207
Magician is kind of
a dirty word around here.

89
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:53,751
I was a magician...
when I was three years old,

90
00:04:53,794 --> 00:04:57,463
but I evolved out of that. Not that
I have anything against magicians,

91
00:04:57,506 --> 00:04:59,424
as long as they're dead.

92
00:05:01,218 --> 00:05:02,885
Buck's been
on all the big shows...

93
00:05:02,928 --> 00:05:06,806
Jim Nabors, Jon Davidson,
Sally Jesse Raphael.

94
00:05:06,849 --> 00:05:09,225
Dinah... he was the co-host
on "Dinah!" many times.

95
00:05:09,268 --> 00:05:11,602
He's performed all over the world...
Las Vegas...

96
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:13,646
but not lately.

97
00:05:15,691 --> 00:05:18,901
Yourjob would be
to take care of all of Buck's travel,

98
00:05:18,944 --> 00:05:20,570
and then to go
on the road with him

99
00:05:20,612 --> 00:05:23,239
to ensure the engagements
were handled smoothly.

100
00:05:23,282 --> 00:05:26,868
It is a very demanding
but ultimately rewarding job.

101
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:28,786
For instance,
in a few months' time

102
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:31,247
we'd be very hard at work
on a benefit that I started

103
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:33,875
for sick children
with my friend George Takei,

104
00:05:33,917 --> 00:05:37,253
who is perhaps best known
for his portrayal of Sulu

105
00:05:37,296 --> 00:05:40,256
on "Star Trek."
He is a dear friend.

106
00:05:40,299 --> 00:05:42,258
This certainly wasn't the kind ofjob

107
00:05:42,301 --> 00:05:44,010
my father would
have envisioned for me,

108
00:05:44,053 --> 00:05:46,888
but there was something
kind of exciting about Buck.

109
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:50,433
He told these long stories about
a world full of his famous friends...

110
00:05:50,476 --> 00:05:52,769
Johnny Carson, Ed McMahon...

111
00:05:52,811 --> 00:05:54,687
The Captain & Tennille.

112
00:05:56,106 --> 00:05:58,274
It was wonderful
to meet you, young man.

113
00:05:58,317 --> 00:06:00,276
I think this can all work out.

114
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,070
Gil, call me later.

115
00:06:02,112 --> 00:06:04,072
So the job's yours if you want it...

116
00:06:04,114 --> 00:06:05,448
pays $650 a week to start.

117
00:06:05,491 --> 00:06:07,450
Uh...

118
00:06:10,954 --> 00:06:13,122
yeah, it sounds great.

119
00:06:13,165 --> 00:06:14,749
Good. You'll be going to
Bakersfield this weekend,

120
00:06:14,792 --> 00:06:16,376
somebody will meet you
and show you the ropes.

121
00:06:16,418 --> 00:06:17,418
Good luck, Troy.

122
00:06:17,461 --> 00:06:19,253
Thank you, Gil.

123
00:06:21,673 --> 00:06:24,300
Edward, your younger readers
may not be aware

124
00:06:24,343 --> 00:06:28,304
that it was actually Johnny Carson
who dubbed me the Great Buck Howard.

125
00:06:28,347 --> 00:06:30,807
Do you recall what trick
you did that night?

126
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:32,850
It's not a trick. It's an effect.

127
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:36,646
Okay, I'm sorry. I didn't realize
there was a difference.

128
00:06:36,688 --> 00:06:39,190
Troy.

129
00:06:39,233 --> 00:06:41,651
Edward, I'm going
to give you a coin.

130
00:06:41,693 --> 00:06:45,363
I would like you to grasp it
between your thumb and your forefinger.

131
00:06:45,406 --> 00:06:49,992
I'm going to count, and whenever
you feel compelled to do so,

132
00:06:50,035 --> 00:06:51,994
you simply drop the coin.
Do you understand?

133
00:06:52,037 --> 00:06:55,456
Ready? One, two,

134
00:06:55,499 --> 00:06:58,501
three.

135
00:06:58,544 --> 00:07:02,547
Troy, could you show Edward
what's written on that piece of paper?

136
00:07:08,679 --> 00:07:11,347
Welcome to Bakersfield!
I'm Sheila Heller.

137
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:13,349
I'm Buck Howard.

138
00:07:14,893 --> 00:07:17,311
This is Alan, Troy...
and this is Edward.

139
00:07:17,354 --> 00:07:20,022
He is a magazine writer
who is doing a profile on me.

140
00:07:20,065 --> 00:07:21,691
- Oh, yeah.
- It's going to be a cover story, right?

141
00:07:21,733 --> 00:07:24,360
- Right.
- Buck needs to head back to the hotel

142
00:07:24,403 --> 00:07:25,862
to prepare for the performance,

143
00:07:25,904 --> 00:07:28,197
but if you could show
Troy and I around...

144
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,575
Oh, that would be no problem at all.

145
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:32,577
I love to come to the venue first

146
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:34,495
and meet the people like you

147
00:07:34,538 --> 00:07:37,957
who keep these places up
and running. Cha-cha-cha.

148
00:07:42,045 --> 00:07:45,631
Dude, check it out.
I like that... nice and big, bro.

149
00:07:50,095 --> 00:07:53,556
Right through here is where we have
the main celebrity dressing room,

150
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,558
which of course is for Buck.

151
00:07:55,601 --> 00:07:58,561
- And we have snacks.
- Where's the brandy?

152
00:08:00,105 --> 00:08:02,023
Oh! God, I knew
we forgot something.

153
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:03,691
I'm so sorry.

154
00:08:03,734 --> 00:08:05,234
- I'll send out for a bottle right away.
- Okay.

155
00:08:05,277 --> 00:08:06,986
Okay. Yeah. Sorry.

156
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:09,822
- Excuse me.
- Go ahead.

157
00:08:09,865 --> 00:08:12,783
Okay. All right.

158
00:08:14,953 --> 00:08:16,579
Oh my God.

159
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:21,584
Ah, but it's part of my job.

160
00:08:21,627 --> 00:08:22,919
You know what I'm saying?

161
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:27,131
There aren't many cues,
but don't let that lull you to sleep.

162
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:28,508
Do you have that intro?

163
00:08:42,981 --> 00:08:45,900
Please tell Buck I am
so sorry about the crowd.

164
00:08:45,943 --> 00:08:47,818
I thought it would
at least be half full.

165
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:50,613
Go tell Buck he's on,

166
00:08:50,656 --> 00:08:53,324
and if he asks,
tell him it's a huge crowd.

167
00:08:57,663 --> 00:08:59,121
So...

168
00:09:05,587 --> 00:09:06,963
Come in.

169
00:09:10,008 --> 00:09:11,801
- How's the crowd?
- Uh, it's pretty full.

170
00:09:11,843 --> 00:09:13,761
Pretty full?
What does that mean?

171
00:09:13,804 --> 00:09:16,597
Nothing. It's a big crowd.

172
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,141
- It's a packed house.
- Great! Let's do it.

173
00:09:20,352 --> 00:09:23,312
Uh, Buck, this way.

174
00:09:23,355 --> 00:09:25,898
Let's do it!

175
00:09:32,698 --> 00:09:34,156
Are you ready?

176
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:35,950
Yes, of course
I'm ready. Let's go.

177
00:09:35,993 --> 00:09:38,286
He's ready. House lights down,
stage lights down, cue tape.

178
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:41,330
...search in sullen silence
on a dull dark dock...

179
00:09:41,373 --> 00:09:45,626
Ladies and gentlemen, it is
my pleasure to introduce to you a man

180
00:09:45,669 --> 00:09:48,004
who has performed in over 27 countries

181
00:09:48,046 --> 00:09:50,631
on radio, television,
and other media,

182
00:09:50,674 --> 00:09:53,342
including "The Tonight Show
with Johnny Carson."

183
00:09:53,385 --> 00:09:55,678
- Presenting the Great Buck Howard!
- Spotlight.

184
00:10:01,852 --> 00:10:04,186
Whoa! There we go!

185
00:10:04,229 --> 00:10:07,023
Stupid amateurs.

186
00:10:07,065 --> 00:10:09,650
I love this town.

187
00:10:09,693 --> 00:10:13,571
All right. Next cue's in 15 minutes
when he goes over to the piano.

188
00:10:13,614 --> 00:10:16,407
I'll be outside.

189
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:20,036
Now, ladies and gentlemen,
I will need a volunteer.

190
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:22,038
In fact, these two handsome,

191
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,665
strapping young lads
down in front will do perfectly...

192
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:28,044
Here's the thing
that struck me about Buck

193
00:10:28,086 --> 00:10:30,004
as I watched
the progression of his show:

194
00:10:30,047 --> 00:10:33,049
He was cheesy...
there was no denying that...

195
00:10:33,091 --> 00:10:36,093
but he also had
a sort of timeless charm

196
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:38,095
that the audience
really seemed to love.

197
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:40,306
Uh-oh.

198
00:10:40,349 --> 00:10:43,142
Uh-oh.

199
00:10:43,185 --> 00:10:48,064
Now, I asked you to choose
a number between one and 100.

200
00:10:48,106 --> 00:10:49,899
But you didn't, did you?

201
00:10:49,941 --> 00:10:53,027
I guess I didn't.

202
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:57,782
Did you choose the number zero?

203
00:10:57,824 --> 00:10:59,700
Whoa.

204
00:10:59,743 --> 00:11:02,078
- Whoa, zero.
- God...

205
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:05,122
Zero.

206
00:11:06,792 --> 00:11:11,003
Isn't that wild, folks?
Isn't that wild?

207
00:11:11,046 --> 00:11:13,589
...deep and profound sleep.

208
00:11:13,632 --> 00:11:16,884
Nighty-night.

209
00:11:16,927 --> 00:11:20,763
What the world needs now

210
00:11:20,806 --> 00:11:24,767
Is love, sweet love...

211
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:27,687
Now I'll need to impose
on you one last time

212
00:11:27,729 --> 00:11:29,313
before I vanish.

213
00:11:29,356 --> 00:11:32,358
I will need four volunteers,
two of whom

214
00:11:32,401 --> 00:11:34,402
will go with me
to the green room.

215
00:11:34,444 --> 00:11:37,488
The other two will stay
here in the auditorium...

216
00:11:37,531 --> 00:11:39,073
Hey.

217
00:11:39,116 --> 00:11:43,369
...and they will take
my entire fee in cash

218
00:11:43,412 --> 00:11:46,956
and they will hide
that fee in here.

219
00:11:46,998 --> 00:11:52,169
If I am unable to find
that cash when I return,

220
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:56,424
that money will stay here
in Bakersfield, California.

221
00:11:56,466 --> 00:11:58,092
I love this town!

222
00:11:58,135 --> 00:12:01,887
I saw him do this
last week in Stockton.

223
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:04,890
Apparently he's never
failed to find his money

224
00:12:04,933 --> 00:12:07,560
in over 5,000 tries.

225
00:12:07,602 --> 00:12:09,186
Hmm.

226
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:12,231
I'll let you choose
your four volunteers.

227
00:12:13,984 --> 00:12:17,069
Guys, come on.
We have to go to the green room.

228
00:12:22,367 --> 00:12:25,035
Gentlemen, this is
my entire entourage,

229
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:28,914
just so you can see there's
absolutely nothing fishy going on

230
00:12:28,957 --> 00:12:30,541
while they hide my money.

231
00:12:30,584 --> 00:12:32,334
You'll be my witnesses.

232
00:12:32,377 --> 00:12:35,337
Would either of you like
a signed photograph?

233
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:36,922
- Oh...
- Yeah.

234
00:12:36,965 --> 00:12:41,010
Alan, some signed photos,
colored ones, please.

235
00:12:41,052 --> 00:12:43,220
I don't see
any of the colored ones.

236
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:46,223
Seek and ye shall find, Alan.
They're in there.

237
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:48,434
My ink pen, please. Ink pen.

238
00:12:50,896 --> 00:12:52,855
- Thank you, Troy.
- Black and white's fine.

239
00:12:52,898 --> 00:12:54,857
No, it's not. It's not fine.

240
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:57,568
- Alan?
- Buck, these are the only ones we have.

241
00:12:59,571 --> 00:13:02,031
Mr. Howard,
they're ready for you.

242
00:13:02,073 --> 00:13:04,074
Oh, well that's fantastic news.

243
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:06,076
Sorry, folks,
there won't be any photograph

244
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:07,870
due to Alan's incompetence.

245
00:13:07,913 --> 00:13:09,580
I'd still like a black and white.

246
00:13:09,623 --> 00:13:12,249
What's the point in having
a black and white?

247
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:14,210
What's the point?

248
00:13:14,252 --> 00:13:15,753
Let's go.

249
00:13:19,216 --> 00:13:21,717
- Thanks a lot.
- I'm sorry.

250
00:13:56,711 --> 00:13:59,630
Sir, may I look
in your right shoe, please?

251
00:14:12,352 --> 00:14:16,021
Oh, well.
I thought it would be more.

252
00:14:18,316 --> 00:14:20,150
How did he do that?

253
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:22,319
I love this town!

254
00:14:26,241 --> 00:14:28,826
- ...in front of these people.
- The only humiliation is

255
00:14:28,869 --> 00:14:30,911
- that you're incompetent.
- That's not true!

256
00:14:30,954 --> 00:14:33,747
- It is true.
- Come out and say that to my face!

257
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:35,749
Go on, get the hell out of here.

258
00:14:35,792 --> 00:14:37,751
Leave the petty cash with Troy.

259
00:14:37,794 --> 00:14:39,545
- That's my money.
- Oh yeah, Buck?

260
00:14:39,588 --> 00:14:41,255
Well, you suck!

261
00:14:43,717 --> 00:14:46,343
I can't train you anymore. You're gonna
have to figure it out for yourself.

262
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:48,512
I don't even know where to begin.

263
00:14:48,555 --> 00:14:51,140
It's not that complicated. Listen,

264
00:14:51,182 --> 00:14:53,142
if you take this job,
you're an idiot.

265
00:14:53,184 --> 00:14:54,727
Do you underst...

266
00:14:54,769 --> 00:14:57,479
Troy, I'm sorry
you had to see this.

267
00:14:57,522 --> 00:15:00,524
Edward, this wouldn't be
a pleasant story.

268
00:15:00,567 --> 00:15:02,359
I'm sure you wouldn't
want to write that down.

269
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:04,361
Alan, I think it's time
for you to leave.

270
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:06,989
- No, okay...
- Otherwise, I'm gonna call security.

271
00:15:07,032 --> 00:15:09,408
Oh, call security, you fossil!

272
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:20,294
Well, I guess this
is adios, fellas.

273
00:15:25,926 --> 00:15:29,803
Excuse me for interrupting.
Could I have your autograph?

274
00:15:29,846 --> 00:15:33,223
Anything for a beautiful young lady.

275
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:34,892
Oh!

276
00:15:37,228 --> 00:15:39,897
Did you enjoy the show?

277
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:43,359
Oh, I didn't see the show. In fact,
I didn't even know you were here.

278
00:15:43,401 --> 00:15:45,903
There was nothing about it
in the paper or anything.

279
00:15:45,946 --> 00:15:50,282
I used to watch you all the time
on the Carson show, though.

280
00:15:50,325 --> 00:15:51,992
That's super.

281
00:15:52,035 --> 00:15:53,869
There you go.

282
00:15:53,912 --> 00:15:55,079
Thank you.

283
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:01,293
Something's bothering you, it seems.

284
00:16:04,214 --> 00:16:06,215
That whole thing with Alan...

285
00:16:06,257 --> 00:16:08,550
Alan and I have been
having problems for years.

286
00:16:08,593 --> 00:16:10,219
That's why I had to let him go.

287
00:16:10,261 --> 00:16:15,099
Troy, I know you have
aspirations beyond this job.

288
00:16:15,141 --> 00:16:18,185
Well, no matter what you decide
to do in the future,

289
00:16:18,228 --> 00:16:20,604
you'll need life experience.
I can give you that.

290
00:16:20,647 --> 00:16:24,274
Some very big things
are about to happen for me.

291
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:26,110
What kind of things?

292
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:29,446
Well, Troy, why don't you
stick around a while,

293
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:31,782
work with me?
Maybe you'll find out.

294
00:16:33,493 --> 00:16:35,119
Deal?

295
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:44,003
I dove in.

296
00:16:44,045 --> 00:16:46,880
My life became
all Buck Howard all the time.

297
00:16:46,923 --> 00:16:49,091
The auditoriums
we played in were old

298
00:16:49,134 --> 00:16:52,136
and usually half full
but Buck didn't seem to notice.

299
00:16:52,178 --> 00:16:54,805
The minute he came out on stage,
he was in his element.

300
00:16:54,848 --> 00:16:57,641
Buck walked the edge.
Everything he did,

301
00:16:57,684 --> 00:16:59,643
he made the impossible
seem possible.

302
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:02,146
Isn't that wild?

303
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:04,148
It's wild!

304
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:06,775
Buck did have his following,

305
00:17:06,818 --> 00:17:09,445
- and we went to them.
- I love this town!

306
00:17:09,487 --> 00:17:13,490
For some reason, the people
of Akron, Ohio went nuts for him.

307
00:17:13,533 --> 00:17:15,492
I saw parts of the country
I'd never seen before...

308
00:17:15,535 --> 00:17:18,662
- Welcome to Willamette, Oregon!
- I love this town!

309
00:17:18,705 --> 00:17:21,248
That I'd never heard of before...

310
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:23,042
Welcome to Wausau, Wisconsin!

311
00:17:23,084 --> 00:17:24,793
I love this town!

312
00:17:24,836 --> 00:17:26,795
Buck did have his quirks.

313
00:17:26,838 --> 00:17:29,298
How much did you
tip the bellman?

314
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:30,799
$2.00.

315
00:17:30,842 --> 00:17:32,676
That's it?

316
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:34,636
You represent me, Troy.

317
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:36,972
You're making me look cheap.

318
00:17:37,015 --> 00:17:39,266
Here you go. Thanks.

319
00:17:39,309 --> 00:17:41,435
Troy, can you come in here?

320
00:17:41,478 --> 00:17:44,605
Did you just give
the bellman $10.00?

321
00:17:44,647 --> 00:17:46,732
- Yes, why?
- It's far too much.

322
00:17:46,775 --> 00:17:49,359
$1.00 cash, American, per bag.

323
00:17:49,402 --> 00:17:50,527
I am not made of money.

324
00:17:53,865 --> 00:17:57,326
And sometimes
he went beyond quirky.

325
00:17:57,368 --> 00:17:59,828
They pick me up in a minivan.

326
00:17:59,871 --> 00:18:01,705
This show is already ruined!

327
00:18:01,748 --> 00:18:03,916
You are incompetent!

328
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:07,002
Yeah, Buck could
be difficult, frustrating,

329
00:18:07,045 --> 00:18:10,255
and at times I had to wonder
why I put up with it all.

330
00:18:10,298 --> 00:18:12,508
Mr. Howard.

331
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:14,802
I want to thank you
so much for having me.

332
00:18:14,844 --> 00:18:16,804
I just wanted to say,
though, I won't be doing

333
00:18:16,846 --> 00:18:18,514
the "You can call me RayJay" bit.

334
00:18:18,556 --> 00:18:19,932
I don't want to do that.

335
00:18:19,974 --> 00:18:22,726
And by the way,
is Mr. Takei here?

336
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:26,814
Um, no, he's uh...
he won't be with us this year.

337
00:18:26,856 --> 00:18:28,690
My college roommate was managing

338
00:18:28,733 --> 00:18:30,192
a multimillion dollar hedge fund

339
00:18:30,235 --> 00:18:32,194
and here I was helping Buck Howard

340
00:18:32,237 --> 00:18:33,862
with his benefit
starring Gary Coleman

341
00:18:33,905 --> 00:18:35,697
and the guy from
the "Police Academy" movies.

342
00:18:37,367 --> 00:18:39,701
The strange thing
was that I didn't mind.

343
00:18:39,744 --> 00:18:41,870
- Hello, Buck Howard.
- It was kind of cool.

344
00:18:41,913 --> 00:18:44,248
Or sad, depending on how
you looked at it.

345
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:46,041
You gotta tell me
how you do it.

346
00:18:46,084 --> 00:18:49,128
I keep getting older
and you look the same.

347
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:51,338
- Clean living.
- Yeah, clean living,

348
00:18:51,381 --> 00:18:53,340
and keeping all your money
under a mattress, right?

349
00:18:53,383 --> 00:18:56,844
Anyhow, Buck, I want
to really thank you for calling me.

350
00:18:56,886 --> 00:19:01,223
You know,
nobody calls me anymore.

351
00:19:01,266 --> 00:19:03,892
Buck, we're ready to start.

352
00:19:05,103 --> 00:19:07,104
Have a great show, everyone.

353
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:16,989
I would like to dedicate
this next song

354
00:19:17,031 --> 00:19:20,409
to a once very very
dear friend of mine,

355
00:19:22,036 --> 00:19:25,622
Sulu, from "the Star Trek,"

356
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:27,624
Mr. George Takei.

357
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:30,711
George,

358
00:19:32,297 --> 00:19:34,256
may the force be in you.

359
00:19:36,634 --> 00:19:40,470
What the world needs now...

360
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:43,015
No matter
how corny Buck's show could be,

361
00:19:43,057 --> 00:19:45,475
and no matter how much
he yelled at me before it,

362
00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:47,477
I never missed
the money effect.

363
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,355
It was the one part of the show
that always amazed me.

364
00:19:50,398 --> 00:19:53,150
Ladies and gentlemen,
my money.

365
00:19:54,861 --> 00:19:58,280
Ladies and gentlemen,
my money.

366
00:19:58,323 --> 00:20:02,284
And without fail,
it always amazed the audience.

367
00:20:02,327 --> 00:20:04,578
True, it would be a pleasure
to retrieve it personally.

368
00:20:04,621 --> 00:20:09,124
As a gentlemen,
I fear I must refrain,

369
00:20:09,167 --> 00:20:12,294
for my money
is in your brassiere.

370
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:19,468
Ladies and gentlemen,
there's the money!

371
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:21,470
I hadn't found my place in the world.

372
00:20:21,512 --> 00:20:24,306
But this finale was Buck's place,

373
00:20:24,349 --> 00:20:26,308
and just getting to be a part of it

374
00:20:26,351 --> 00:20:29,937
made me feel like
I was on the right track.

375
00:20:29,979 --> 00:20:33,774
Troy, we have the last
of the Great Buck autograph seekers.

376
00:20:33,816 --> 00:20:38,737
A colored photograph.
To whom shall I address it?

377
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:40,530
Dad, what are you doing here?

378
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:43,867
I was gonna ask you
the same question.

379
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:48,664
- Uh...
- Troy, this is your father?

380
00:20:48,706 --> 00:20:51,416
I didn't know
you had family in Leesburg.

381
00:20:51,459 --> 00:20:53,627
He doesn't.

382
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:56,755
Sir, what a pleasure.

383
00:20:56,798 --> 00:20:58,715
I'm Buck Howard.

384
00:20:58,758 --> 00:21:01,760
But before
you congratulate me on the show

385
00:21:01,803 --> 00:21:03,512
I have to congratulate
you on something.

386
00:21:03,554 --> 00:21:06,473
I want you to know you have raised
a very fine young man

387
00:21:06,516 --> 00:21:08,558
who is doing
a wonderful job for me.

388
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:10,727
Hmm. I thought
he was in law school,

389
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:12,980
because that's what he told me.

390
00:21:13,022 --> 00:21:17,567
But I am thrilled to hear that
he's doing a wonderful job for you.

391
00:21:22,782 --> 00:21:24,700
Uh-oh.

392
00:21:24,742 --> 00:21:28,829
You know, Mr. Gable,
I can imagine how you feel.

393
00:21:28,871 --> 00:21:31,581
My father didn't want me
to go into show business.

394
00:21:31,624 --> 00:21:33,375
He wanted me to be
an accountant.

395
00:21:33,418 --> 00:21:36,545
Obviously that wasn't my calling.

396
00:21:36,587 --> 00:21:39,214
Yeah, well, I'm not gonna touch that.

397
00:21:39,257 --> 00:21:43,677
But if carrying your bags
is Troy's calling, well then I just

398
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:46,346
wasted a lot of money
on his education.

399
00:21:46,389 --> 00:21:49,224
- Dad.
- Troy, may I?

400
00:21:49,267 --> 00:21:51,560
You know, sir,
I have a theory about that.

401
00:21:51,602 --> 00:21:54,896
I call it my onwards
and upwards theory.

402
00:21:54,939 --> 00:21:57,983
Perhaps you noticed
in the musical portion of my...

403
00:21:58,026 --> 00:22:00,777
Listen, I'd like to
talk to my son alone.

404
00:22:03,781 --> 00:22:05,741
Very well.
I was merely trying to add

405
00:22:05,783 --> 00:22:09,411
a little perspectivo,
as the Latins say.

406
00:22:09,454 --> 00:22:11,121
I think you've done that.

407
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:15,334
Very well. Good evening.

408
00:22:15,376 --> 00:22:20,130
Troy, you can bring that and toss
my salad when you get back to the hotel.

409
00:22:23,926 --> 00:22:25,886
That's a hell of a guy.

410
00:22:25,928 --> 00:22:28,096
Dad, I'm sorry.

411
00:22:28,139 --> 00:22:31,308
I haven't heard from you
in over a month.

412
00:22:31,351 --> 00:22:34,811
I had to call your friends
like I was some kind of freaking cop.

413
00:22:34,854 --> 00:22:36,772
I know.

414
00:22:36,814 --> 00:22:39,775
I would have killed
to go to law school, Troy.

415
00:22:39,817 --> 00:22:41,568
I would have killed.

416
00:22:41,611 --> 00:22:43,904
I hated it.

417
00:22:43,946 --> 00:22:47,115
- I wasn't happy. I...
- You think I danced out the front door

418
00:22:47,158 --> 00:22:49,534
every morning
in my adult life happy

419
00:22:49,577 --> 00:22:52,454
about where I was
gonna be spending my day?

420
00:22:52,497 --> 00:22:55,957
I don't know what
you're doing here.

421
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,794
I don't think you do either.

422
00:22:58,836 --> 00:23:02,047
But come on.
You're smarter than this.

423
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:03,965
You are.

424
00:23:04,008 --> 00:23:06,510
You are smarter than this.

425
00:23:08,554 --> 00:23:10,347
I hope he enjoys his Cobb salad.

426
00:23:28,574 --> 00:23:31,993
I just don't think, uh...

427
00:23:32,036 --> 00:23:35,330
I don't think
I can do this anymore.

428
00:23:35,373 --> 00:23:38,375
I'm sorry.
I have to resign.

429
00:23:40,253 --> 00:23:41,753
I have to resign.

430
00:23:41,796 --> 00:23:43,839
Gil's not here yet?

431
00:23:45,007 --> 00:23:46,716
Uh, no, he's not.

432
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:49,010
Buck, there's something
I need to discuss with you.

433
00:23:49,053 --> 00:23:51,847
Sorry I'm late. Traffic.

434
00:23:51,889 --> 00:23:55,016
Can we talk later?
We'll get back to this,

435
00:23:55,059 --> 00:23:57,769
but there is some business
I need to discuss.

436
00:23:57,812 --> 00:23:59,604
I've tried.

437
00:23:59,647 --> 00:24:02,274
I'm on the horn to the guys
at Leno, Letterman, every week.

438
00:24:02,316 --> 00:24:05,235
They want to have you on the show.
They're just booked tightly right now.

439
00:24:05,278 --> 00:24:08,196
Letterman I understand
because I don't have a history there.

440
00:24:08,239 --> 00:24:12,367
But this Jay Leno... I think
he's doing his show a great disservice

441
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:15,537
by not having me. I practically built
"The Tonight Show."

442
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:17,956
I know we need to get you
some attention right now.

443
00:24:17,999 --> 00:24:19,958
I speak to the bookers in Vegas.

444
00:24:20,001 --> 00:24:21,418
I tell them you're better now
than you've ever been.

445
00:24:21,461 --> 00:24:23,879
They tell me
they just need to see it.

446
00:24:23,921 --> 00:24:26,423
If they need to see something,

447
00:24:26,466 --> 00:24:28,717
I've got something
I can show them.

448
00:24:32,513 --> 00:24:36,725
For the past three years
I have been rehearsing in secret

449
00:24:36,767 --> 00:24:39,561
a new effect. I can't even tell
either of you what it is.

450
00:24:39,604 --> 00:24:42,856
It's not that I don't trust you,
but I cannot afford

451
00:24:42,899 --> 00:24:45,233
that the tabloids
get a hold of this now.

452
00:24:45,276 --> 00:24:49,613
Let me just say it is enormous.

453
00:24:49,655 --> 00:24:53,366
And I think Cincinnati is
the perfect place to unveil it.

454
00:24:53,409 --> 00:24:56,578
They have always
loved me in Ohio.

455
00:24:56,621 --> 00:25:00,624
Not so much Ohio,
but Akron.

456
00:25:00,666 --> 00:25:03,919
It's close to Cincinnat...
it's the same state.

457
00:25:03,961 --> 00:25:08,423
I need you to call Steve Keating
in New York at the top P.R. firm.

458
00:25:08,466 --> 00:25:11,426
I want local press
and national press.

459
00:25:11,469 --> 00:25:15,096
I can feel this.
It's gonna be huge.

460
00:25:15,139 --> 00:25:17,140
Cincinnati.

461
00:25:25,942 --> 00:25:27,859
Welcome to Cincinnati!

462
00:25:27,902 --> 00:25:28,985
I love this town!

463
00:25:29,028 --> 00:25:30,862
- I'm Doreen.
- How do you do?

464
00:25:30,905 --> 00:25:32,322
I'm Buck Howard.

465
00:25:32,365 --> 00:25:34,407
This is my brother Kenny.

466
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:36,868
- Hello, Kenny. How are you?
- Good.

467
00:25:36,911 --> 00:25:39,120
On behalf of both of us,

468
00:25:39,163 --> 00:25:42,499
and the Cincinnati chapter
of the Red Hat Society,

469
00:25:42,542 --> 00:25:47,546
I'd like to present you
with this pin.

470
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:51,299
Well, my goodness.

471
00:25:51,342 --> 00:25:53,468
Isn't that beautiful?
Ow!

472
00:25:53,511 --> 00:25:56,012
- Oh!
- Agh! Mmm!

473
00:25:56,055 --> 00:25:58,139
You may have
drawn blood there.

474
00:25:58,182 --> 00:25:59,808
- I'm so sorry.
- It's all right.

475
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:01,851
It's a beautiful pin
from a beautiful woman

476
00:26:01,894 --> 00:26:03,770
and I will wear it
while I'm here.

477
00:26:03,813 --> 00:26:06,189
The entire time I'm here,
I'll wear it for good luck.

478
00:26:06,232 --> 00:26:09,025
Boy, I love to come
to these venues before the show,

479
00:26:09,068 --> 00:26:12,153
but I'm afraid I'm gonna have to
get back to the hotel

480
00:26:12,196 --> 00:26:14,823
because my press relations attache

481
00:26:14,865 --> 00:26:18,660
has flown in for a rendezvous
from the borough of Manhattan.

482
00:26:18,703 --> 00:26:20,829
That's no problem at all.
We're your hosts.

483
00:26:20,871 --> 00:26:24,833
We'll be taking you anywhere you need
to go the whole time you're here.

484
00:26:24,875 --> 00:26:26,835
That's how we do it
in Cincinnati.

485
00:26:26,877 --> 00:26:30,130
I'm gonna drive you.
We got a limo and everything.

486
00:26:34,093 --> 00:26:38,638
I saw you, 1989,
Bowling Green University.

487
00:26:38,681 --> 00:26:41,182
You were awesome!
Do you remember that?

488
00:26:41,225 --> 00:26:45,312
Honestly, I do
vaguely remember that.

489
00:26:45,354 --> 00:26:47,939
But of course that's
nearly 20 years ago,

490
00:26:47,982 --> 00:26:50,525
and I do 400 or so shows a year.

491
00:26:50,568 --> 00:26:53,028
You do 400 shows a year?

492
00:26:55,072 --> 00:26:57,907
Yeah, uh, I'm doing
the calculations in my head...

493
00:26:57,950 --> 00:26:59,909
You might want
to face that way.

494
00:26:59,952 --> 00:27:03,371
And I don't even see how 300 dates
is physically possible. I mean...

495
00:27:05,416 --> 00:27:07,792
that's pretty much
a show every night, you know?

496
00:27:07,835 --> 00:27:10,003
I mean, where do you perform
on Monday and Tuesday nights

497
00:27:10,046 --> 00:27:12,213
and how does that
allow for travel time?

498
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:16,968
Troy, he has to be checked in
by now. It's Steve Keating. K-e-a.

499
00:27:17,011 --> 00:27:20,555
Buck, I know how to spell.
I told him his name a thousand times.

500
00:27:20,598 --> 00:27:22,557
They're saying
he hasn't checked in.

501
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:26,227
Well, this is absurd.
I have to do the TV show this afternoon.

502
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:28,855
I don't have
my press attaché,

503
00:27:28,898 --> 00:27:33,735
I'm forced to be driven around
by these two hayseeds all day long.

504
00:27:35,821 --> 00:27:38,031
Maybe that's him, Troy.
Get the door.

505
00:27:40,785 --> 00:27:42,744
Hello.

506
00:27:42,787 --> 00:27:44,913
Do I have the right room?
I'm looking for Buck Howard.

507
00:27:44,955 --> 00:27:47,457
Troy, can you hang up
my pants, please?

508
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,584
How can I help you, miss?

509
00:27:49,627 --> 00:27:52,921
Mr. Howard, I'm Valerie Brennan
from K.P.T. Steve couldn't make it.

510
00:27:52,963 --> 00:27:56,675
There was this emergency
in London with Gary Oldman

511
00:27:56,717 --> 00:27:58,426
so I will be working with you.

512
00:27:58,469 --> 00:28:01,304
With you?
You're practically an embryo.

513
00:28:01,347 --> 00:28:03,765
I really don't take this very well.

514
00:28:03,808 --> 00:28:05,308
I'm sorry. I don't like
these kind of changes.

515
00:28:05,351 --> 00:28:07,602
I have a very big weekend.

516
00:28:07,645 --> 00:28:09,187
I have my show Saturday.

517
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:11,189
I have an enormous event
planned for Sunday.

518
00:28:11,232 --> 00:28:13,525
And I know all about it.
I have been briefed.

519
00:28:13,567 --> 00:28:15,485
It's gonna be perfect.

520
00:28:15,528 --> 00:28:17,529
I know you hired Steve,

521
00:28:17,571 --> 00:28:20,740
but I think I can fill in
for him quite capably.

522
00:28:22,493 --> 00:28:25,078
All right, young lady,
we'll give it a shot, see how it goes.

523
00:28:25,121 --> 00:28:27,664
Good. My name's Valerie.

524
00:28:27,707 --> 00:28:30,750
Very well, Valerie.

525
00:28:30,793 --> 00:28:33,920
This is Troy,
my road manager.

526
00:28:33,963 --> 00:28:35,755
Hi.

527
00:28:35,798 --> 00:28:38,174
So why don't you get some rest?

528
00:28:38,217 --> 00:28:40,176
The news is
in a couple of hours

529
00:28:40,219 --> 00:28:41,761
and I need to work
on your schedule.

530
00:28:41,804 --> 00:28:44,848
If you could spare Troy,
that would be great.

531
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:47,058
He could help me roll some calls.

532
00:28:47,101 --> 00:28:49,978
- Troy, do you mind?
- No.

533
00:28:51,522 --> 00:28:53,022
Well, it was nice meeting you.

534
00:28:56,444 --> 00:28:57,485
Thank you.

535
00:28:59,989 --> 00:29:04,534
From the shining se-ee-ea...

536
00:29:06,495 --> 00:29:09,205
So, you wanted to
go over something?

537
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:13,251
Oh, no. I just want
to go over a drink about now.

538
00:29:13,294 --> 00:29:15,378
Can I have a scotch
on the rocks?

539
00:29:15,421 --> 00:29:17,338
- And you, sir?
- Uh, same.

540
00:29:17,381 --> 00:29:19,340
Very good.

541
00:29:19,383 --> 00:29:22,635
I can't believe I'm in Cincinnati
with Buck Howard.

542
00:29:25,389 --> 00:29:27,348
Can I ask you
something about Buck?

543
00:29:27,391 --> 00:29:29,350
- Yeah.
- Is he gay?

544
00:29:29,393 --> 00:29:31,561
'Cause we got a bet
going in the office.

545
00:29:31,604 --> 00:29:34,814
I don't know.

546
00:29:34,857 --> 00:29:37,776
So you're not his, um,

547
00:29:37,818 --> 00:29:39,194
traveling companion, or...

548
00:29:39,236 --> 00:29:40,653
- No.
- Okay. Okay.

549
00:29:40,696 --> 00:29:42,614
It just looked
kind of domestic up in the room

550
00:29:42,656 --> 00:29:45,408
with you handling his pants.

551
00:29:45,451 --> 00:29:48,536
No, Buck's just my boss.

552
00:29:48,579 --> 00:29:51,664
I'm just doing this to pay the bills,

553
00:29:51,707 --> 00:29:55,335
you know, until I figure out...

554
00:29:55,377 --> 00:29:57,128
What you really want to do.

555
00:29:57,171 --> 00:29:58,880
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

556
00:29:58,923 --> 00:30:00,840
Okay, so, let me guess.

557
00:30:00,883 --> 00:30:04,969
You... you're a good looking guy,
so you're an actor.

558
00:30:05,012 --> 00:30:07,347
No.

559
00:30:08,557 --> 00:30:09,724
Stand up?

560
00:30:09,767 --> 00:30:11,893
Oh, God no.

561
00:30:11,936 --> 00:30:13,603
Okay, hold on, hold on.

562
00:30:13,646 --> 00:30:17,440
Um, you're a writer.

563
00:30:18,442 --> 00:30:19,943
- Did I get it?
- No.

564
00:30:19,985 --> 00:30:20,985
Yeah.

565
00:30:21,028 --> 00:30:23,655
I do a little writing.

566
00:30:23,697 --> 00:30:25,740
What little writing
have you done?

567
00:30:25,783 --> 00:30:28,910
Just little stuff, silly stuff,

568
00:30:28,953 --> 00:30:32,956
stuff that's happened to me, or stuff
that didn't happen that I wish happened,

569
00:30:32,998 --> 00:30:34,541
things like that.

570
00:30:34,583 --> 00:30:36,376
Well, you sound like
a writer to me.

571
00:30:36,418 --> 00:30:37,752
Hmm.

572
00:30:37,795 --> 00:30:39,295
Thank you.

573
00:30:39,338 --> 00:30:41,089
Hey, I didn't say
you were a good writer.

574
00:30:43,133 --> 00:30:45,093
Okay, I'm gonna go.

575
00:30:45,135 --> 00:30:46,886
This was fun. It was nice.

576
00:30:46,929 --> 00:30:51,015
So I'm gonna go freshen up
for our big night out.

577
00:30:51,058 --> 00:30:53,101
I'll see you at dinner.

578
00:31:01,569 --> 00:31:05,321
I can't believe that you know
Sulu from "Star Trek."

579
00:31:05,364 --> 00:31:09,075
Hey, what about Spock?
You know him too?

580
00:31:09,118 --> 00:31:12,453
I've met Leonard Nimoy
but I wouldn't say we're friends.

581
00:31:12,496 --> 00:31:14,664
And for that matter, George and I

582
00:31:14,707 --> 00:31:17,083
aren't on the best of terms
at the moment, I'm afraid.

583
00:31:17,126 --> 00:31:19,627
Mr. Howard, have you
ever been married?

584
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:22,171
No, I've never met
the right little lady.

585
00:31:22,214 --> 00:31:24,007
Yeah, right.

586
00:31:24,049 --> 00:31:27,844
As Shirley MacLaine said,
"True love is supposed to be rare.

587
00:31:27,887 --> 00:31:29,095
That's how we know
it's valuable."

588
00:31:29,138 --> 00:31:30,680
That's beautiful.

589
00:31:30,723 --> 00:31:32,473
Shirley's actually a client of ours.

590
00:31:32,516 --> 00:31:33,808
She is a very nice woman.

591
00:31:33,851 --> 00:31:36,060
You know Shirley MacLaine?

592
00:31:36,103 --> 00:31:39,188
That's what I do. I arrange and
coordinate publicity for celebrities.

593
00:31:39,231 --> 00:31:40,899
- Well, give us some dirt!
- No!

594
00:31:40,941 --> 00:31:43,026
We want to know
who's sleeping with who!

595
00:31:43,068 --> 00:31:45,570
- I take the fifth because...
- I know Shirley. She...

596
00:31:45,613 --> 00:31:47,864
- I cannot say anything complimentary.
- She came to a show I did.

597
00:31:47,907 --> 00:31:49,324
All right, tell us who's nice, then.

598
00:31:49,366 --> 00:31:52,452
Okay. Um, so,

599
00:31:52,494 --> 00:31:54,537
people like to make fun
of Keanu Reeves,

600
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:56,539
right, 'cause he's...

601
00:31:56,582 --> 00:31:58,958
but he is one of the sweetest
guys you will ever meet.

602
00:31:59,001 --> 00:32:01,002
Oh, you can tell that.

603
00:32:01,045 --> 00:32:03,129
Tell him he kicked butt
in "The Matrix"!

604
00:32:03,172 --> 00:32:04,756
- Tell him.
- Okay.

605
00:32:04,798 --> 00:32:06,591
Um, and, um, Jay Leno...

606
00:32:08,052 --> 00:32:09,802
he's just a regular guy
from Boston.

607
00:32:09,845 --> 00:32:13,014
Just really down to earth,
really sweet.

608
00:32:13,057 --> 00:32:14,849
You think Jay Leno is

609
00:32:14,892 --> 00:32:18,895
just a regular sweet guy
from Boston?

610
00:32:18,938 --> 00:32:22,732
You don't have the slightest idea
what you're talking about.

611
00:32:24,109 --> 00:32:26,861
Well, I met Jay Leno
a number of times

612
00:32:26,904 --> 00:32:29,155
and he's always
been really warm.

613
00:32:29,198 --> 00:32:30,698
Then he was faking.

614
00:32:30,741 --> 00:32:34,160
I know Jay Leno, missy.
I know him.

615
00:32:34,203 --> 00:32:35,995
I've dealt with Jay Leno.

616
00:32:36,038 --> 00:32:38,915
- You'll have to trust me on this one.
- I...

617
00:32:45,047 --> 00:32:47,090
Buck Howard?
To makeup.

618
00:32:48,884 --> 00:32:50,843
No, Buck. This way.

619
00:32:50,886 --> 00:32:52,345
Let's do it!

620
00:32:54,306 --> 00:32:57,308
I'll be right back. I have to go
call and check in on the boys.

621
00:32:58,686 --> 00:33:03,022
She's great, my sister.

622
00:33:03,065 --> 00:33:05,024
She's a genius,

623
00:33:05,067 --> 00:33:09,195
very artistic, been married
a whole bunch of times.

624
00:33:09,238 --> 00:33:12,740
She's lived a glamorous life.

625
00:33:12,783 --> 00:33:14,909
Sounds like it.

626
00:33:17,454 --> 00:33:19,455
Hey.

627
00:33:20,958 --> 00:33:22,917
How does Buck do his tricks?

628
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:25,420
I'm not gonna tell anyone, I swear.

629
00:33:25,462 --> 00:33:27,922
I don't know. I don't...

630
00:33:27,965 --> 00:33:31,092
You're his assistant.
He's got to tell you something.

631
00:33:31,135 --> 00:33:34,971
Kenny, as far as I know, it's real.

632
00:33:36,557 --> 00:33:38,266
Damn.

633
00:33:38,308 --> 00:33:40,685
They're gonna go to commercial
in a couple of minutes.

634
00:33:40,728 --> 00:33:42,353
Then we're on.

635
00:33:42,396 --> 00:33:45,356
The producer says
we can watch from the booth.

636
00:33:45,399 --> 00:33:47,108
Okay.

637
00:33:47,151 --> 00:33:50,570
You smell really nice.

638
00:33:53,157 --> 00:33:55,450
Thanks.

639
00:33:55,492 --> 00:33:57,452
Cindy Crown here,
back with magician Buck Howard,

640
00:33:57,494 --> 00:34:00,538
or the Great Buck Howard
as he's more commonly known.

641
00:34:00,581 --> 00:34:03,708
It is wonderful to have you
in Cincinnati, Buck.

642
00:34:03,751 --> 00:34:07,128
Thanks, Cindy.
I'm very glad to be here.

643
00:34:07,171 --> 00:34:10,590
Yes, and I understand
you're here for a very special show.

644
00:34:10,632 --> 00:34:12,133
That's correct, Cindy.

645
00:34:12,176 --> 00:34:13,801
On Saturday evening,

646
00:34:13,844 --> 00:34:16,304
I will be performing

647
00:34:16,346 --> 00:34:19,223
at the Cincinnati Arts Complex.

648
00:34:19,266 --> 00:34:22,310
I was afraid Ohio
may have an arts complex,

649
00:34:22,352 --> 00:34:24,645
but I never expected
it would be in Cincinnati.

650
00:34:25,856 --> 00:34:27,523
And on Sunday afternoon,

651
00:34:27,566 --> 00:34:30,318
I'll be staging
a very important event.

652
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,944
Why don't you tell us about that?

653
00:34:34,573 --> 00:34:37,658
This has been top secret
to this very moment.

654
00:34:37,701 --> 00:34:41,662
At roughly 2:00 P.M.,

655
00:34:41,705 --> 00:34:43,831
I will put to sleep

656
00:34:43,874 --> 00:34:45,833
900 souls,

657
00:34:45,876 --> 00:34:49,337
whom I will wake up
immediately afterwards,

658
00:34:49,379 --> 00:34:52,298
as if from the dead.

659
00:34:52,341 --> 00:34:55,009
Well, that sounds just super.

660
00:34:55,052 --> 00:34:56,844
Be sure to come out
for both events, folks.

661
00:34:56,887 --> 00:34:59,430
Now, I've heard you're going
to do a warmup

662
00:34:59,473 --> 00:35:01,641
by performing
a magic trick on me.

663
00:35:01,683 --> 00:35:05,311
Take this piece of paper
in your left hand.

664
00:35:05,354 --> 00:35:07,355
I'll need a coin. Ah!

665
00:35:07,397 --> 00:35:08,856
Yes, there's one.

666
00:35:08,899 --> 00:35:10,691
Oh!

667
00:35:10,734 --> 00:35:15,113
I want you to hold
that silver dollar in your hand

668
00:35:15,155 --> 00:35:17,156
between your thumb
and your forefinger.

669
00:35:17,199 --> 00:35:19,325
I will begin counting.

670
00:35:19,368 --> 00:35:23,538
Whenever you feel compelled, all you
need to do is simply drop the coin.

671
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:25,540
Ready?

672
00:35:25,582 --> 00:35:30,878
One, two,

673
00:35:30,921 --> 00:35:32,880
three,

674
00:35:32,923 --> 00:35:38,219
four.

675
00:35:40,222 --> 00:35:41,389
Five.

676
00:35:41,431 --> 00:35:43,182
- 20 seconds, Cindy.
- six.

677
00:35:43,225 --> 00:35:46,018
Cindy, you do understand
that at some point in time

678
00:35:46,061 --> 00:35:49,105
- you have to let the coin drop.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

679
00:35:49,148 --> 00:35:51,607
- Maybe I didn't understand.
- 10 seconds, Cindy.

680
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:53,067
We're almost out of time.

681
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:55,278
But we can do this
very quickly. Go ahead.

682
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:58,322
Hold out your hand.
We'll try it one more time very quickly.

683
00:35:58,365 --> 00:36:00,241
Ready...

684
00:36:00,284 --> 00:36:02,577
- I'm sorry, we are out of time, Buck.
- Oh my God.

685
00:36:02,619 --> 00:36:05,454
- And thank you...
- Cut 'em off.

686
00:36:05,497 --> 00:36:08,583
- Let's don't drop the coin...
- We're out.

687
00:36:08,625 --> 00:36:11,294
Maybe you could come back
at some other point in the future.

688
00:36:12,921 --> 00:36:14,964
Listen, I'm sorry.
Mr. Howard...

689
00:36:20,554 --> 00:36:22,513
What the hell is wrong
with that guy?

690
00:36:22,556 --> 00:36:25,349
He won't pick up his phone
and I'm trying to apologize.

691
00:36:25,392 --> 00:36:28,603
I don't know what for,
but I am trying to apologize.

692
00:36:28,645 --> 00:36:31,230
It's okay. Just relax.

693
00:36:31,273 --> 00:36:33,232
Trust me.
This is what Buck is like.

694
00:36:33,275 --> 00:36:35,735
Tomorrow he'll act like
nothing happened.

695
00:36:35,777 --> 00:36:37,653
What are we doing here?

696
00:36:39,156 --> 00:36:40,948
I mean, seriously,

697
00:36:40,991 --> 00:36:42,742
how on earth does a guy like you

698
00:36:42,784 --> 00:36:44,202
wind up working with Buck Howard?

699
00:36:44,244 --> 00:36:46,704
- I want to know.
- I had just quit law school

700
00:36:46,747 --> 00:36:48,289
and moved to L.A.

701
00:36:48,332 --> 00:36:51,626
I bet you wish you'd just stayed in
school right about now.

702
00:36:51,668 --> 00:36:53,252
No way.

703
00:36:53,295 --> 00:36:56,005
Look, Buck is no picnic,

704
00:36:56,048 --> 00:36:58,799
but law school was...
oh my God.

705
00:36:58,842 --> 00:37:00,760
I would wake up every day there

706
00:37:00,802 --> 00:37:02,762
just dreading life.

707
00:37:02,804 --> 00:37:06,849
Look, I'll admit I have
no idea what I'm doing,

708
00:37:06,892 --> 00:37:09,644
and obviously I've got to
quit this job and figure it out,

709
00:37:09,686 --> 00:37:12,980
but I'm trying,

710
00:37:13,023 --> 00:37:14,982
and it feels good.

711
00:37:15,025 --> 00:37:17,151
It feels like what I'm supposed
to do, you know?

712
00:37:17,194 --> 00:37:20,029
Oh, come on.
You're not supposed to do anything.

713
00:37:20,072 --> 00:37:22,657
Life is not magical like that, okay?

714
00:37:22,699 --> 00:37:24,242
No one is supposed to do anything.

715
00:37:24,284 --> 00:37:26,202
How do you know that?

716
00:37:26,245 --> 00:37:28,996
'Cause it boils down
to the same thing for everyone,

717
00:37:29,039 --> 00:37:32,667
from Buck Howard
to Meryl Streep to you.

718
00:37:32,709 --> 00:37:36,754
Most creative people, they just want
the world to love and adore them,

719
00:37:36,797 --> 00:37:38,172
which is infantile.

720
00:37:38,215 --> 00:37:40,049
Okay, all right.

721
00:37:40,092 --> 00:37:43,886
Maybe I'm naive, but

722
00:37:43,929 --> 00:37:46,389
life is short,

723
00:37:46,431 --> 00:37:49,600
you know?
I mean, someday

724
00:37:49,643 --> 00:37:51,185
we're not gonna be here.

725
00:37:51,228 --> 00:37:53,604
And if that's the case,

726
00:37:53,647 --> 00:37:57,692
I want to spend the time
that I have doing something

727
00:37:57,734 --> 00:37:59,527
that makes my heart race.

728
00:37:59,569 --> 00:38:02,571
I don't care what
that says about me.

729
00:38:02,614 --> 00:38:04,657
It's how I feel.

730
00:38:06,368 --> 00:38:08,577
That really turns me on.

731
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:11,706
Are you serious?

732
00:38:11,748 --> 00:38:15,918
Yeah. That whole existential thing...

733
00:38:18,714 --> 00:38:21,257
I have a boyfriend.

734
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:23,342
Oh, forget I said it.

735
00:38:38,608 --> 00:38:40,985
- Hello?
- Troy, are you asleep?

736
00:38:41,028 --> 00:38:43,779
Buck, no, I'm awake.

737
00:38:43,822 --> 00:38:45,448
I just think I'm coming down
with something. What's up?

738
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:47,450
Where the hell is Valerie?

739
00:38:47,492 --> 00:38:50,244
She's supposed to be
organizing interviews for me today.

740
00:38:50,287 --> 00:38:52,955
I have no idea where she is.

741
00:38:54,791 --> 00:38:57,710
I don't know where she is exactly,

742
00:38:57,753 --> 00:39:00,713
but I'm sure she's on top of it.

743
00:39:00,756 --> 00:39:02,423
I'll try and track her down.

744
00:39:02,466 --> 00:39:05,301
I was just on my way
to the theater right now.

745
00:39:05,344 --> 00:39:07,970
Well, I'll be in my room preparing
for the show tonight.

746
00:39:08,013 --> 00:39:11,015
I don't want to be disturbed
unless it's for press.

747
00:39:11,058 --> 00:39:13,559
Okay.

748
00:39:13,602 --> 00:39:16,270
Spotlight on me.
Buck will enter stage right,

749
00:39:16,313 --> 00:39:18,481
come up to the microphone...
"I love this town"...

750
00:39:18,523 --> 00:39:20,066
do a few effects.

751
00:39:20,108 --> 00:39:22,109
Eventually he will come
over to the piano.

752
00:39:22,152 --> 00:39:24,987
Basically just stay on Buck
the whole time. That's all you...

753
00:39:30,702 --> 00:39:33,996
- Hi.
- Mmm.

754
00:39:35,916 --> 00:39:37,833
- Uh...
- Oh, uh...

755
00:39:37,876 --> 00:39:39,585
I have to show you something.

756
00:39:45,675 --> 00:39:48,010
Edward's article.

757
00:39:49,805 --> 00:39:51,389
Now, I heard it was coming,

758
00:39:51,431 --> 00:39:54,141
and I heard it was bad...

759
00:39:54,184 --> 00:39:56,769
it's, I mean, yeah...

760
00:39:56,812 --> 00:39:59,271
he pretty much makes fun
of Buck the entire time.

761
00:40:02,359 --> 00:40:04,485
Okay.

762
00:40:04,528 --> 00:40:08,030
Uh, we can't let him see this.

763
00:40:09,699 --> 00:40:11,784
No, it's this one
right here, Mr. Howard.

764
00:40:11,827 --> 00:40:13,494
Oh.

765
00:40:13,537 --> 00:40:17,289
Mr. Howard, I just wanted to
ask you if it would be okay

766
00:40:17,332 --> 00:40:19,542
for me to introduce you
before the show tonight.

767
00:40:19,584 --> 00:40:22,336
No, it wouldn't be okay.
I'm always introduced on tape...

768
00:40:22,379 --> 00:40:24,046
always have been, always will be.

769
00:40:24,089 --> 00:40:27,049
That's a nice outfit, though.
Very becoming.

770
00:40:31,847 --> 00:40:35,057
Just there, Kenny.
Thank you.

771
00:40:38,061 --> 00:40:40,020
- Kenny, that will be all, thank you.
- Yep, okay.

772
00:40:40,063 --> 00:40:42,231
I'm all over there.

773
00:40:42,274 --> 00:40:44,817
Troy, this is urgent.

774
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:48,320
I don't want this Kenny fellow
anywhere near me.

775
00:40:48,363 --> 00:40:52,158
Our policy is "Out of the way, freak,
I have to catch a train."

776
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:54,243
Do you understand?

777
00:40:54,286 --> 00:40:56,662
Give him a photo,
a colored one.

778
00:40:56,705 --> 00:40:58,706
Actually, no, get him
a black and white.

779
00:40:58,748 --> 00:41:02,918
Second thing... why didn't we do
any more interviews today?

780
00:41:02,961 --> 00:41:06,046
What is the mental midget
Valerie doing?

781
00:41:06,089 --> 00:41:07,673
She got you an interview today.

782
00:41:07,716 --> 00:41:09,341
In fact, they're on
their way here right now.

783
00:41:09,384 --> 00:41:11,343
- With who?
- An internet columnist.

784
00:41:11,386 --> 00:41:13,053
I don't even know that paper.

785
00:41:13,096 --> 00:41:15,055
And it's here and now,
in a few minutes.

786
00:41:15,098 --> 00:41:16,974
I knew nothing about it.

787
00:41:17,017 --> 00:41:20,311
This is the time I have
to prepare for the show, Troy,

788
00:41:20,353 --> 00:41:22,229
and what good would it do
to do an interview now?

789
00:41:22,272 --> 00:41:27,067
I think Valerie is concentrating
more on tomorrow's big event.

790
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:29,695
She was told that the locals here
would pack the place tonight.

791
00:41:32,282 --> 00:41:36,410
Buck, I have Mark Simpson
here to interview you.

792
00:41:36,453 --> 00:41:39,872
Hello, young man.
I have heard a lot about you.

793
00:41:39,915 --> 00:41:42,708
- I'm a really big fan.
- Whoa.

794
00:41:42,751 --> 00:41:48,005
Come on over, sit with me.
Pull you up a chair.

795
00:41:48,048 --> 00:41:50,216
I won't have long to give you.

796
00:41:50,258 --> 00:41:52,134
I've had a lot of press today.

797
00:42:08,151 --> 00:42:09,193
Buck, are you ready?

798
00:42:09,236 --> 00:42:11,445
Yeah.

799
00:42:11,488 --> 00:42:13,864
Okay, Jeff, Buck is ready.

800
00:42:13,907 --> 00:42:15,950
House lights down.

801
00:42:18,328 --> 00:42:19,662
Cue tape.

802
00:42:21,665 --> 00:42:23,874
Stage lights, please.

803
00:42:23,917 --> 00:42:26,126
- What is she doing?
- Thank you.

804
00:42:26,169 --> 00:42:28,754
It's okay.
She's got a big surprise for you.

805
00:42:28,797 --> 00:42:30,756
I wanted to welcome
the Great Buck Howard...

806
00:42:30,799 --> 00:42:33,634
- Oh my God.
- to Cincinnati in my own special way,

807
00:42:33,677 --> 00:42:37,805
so I composed a little song.
I hope he likes it.

808
00:42:37,847 --> 00:42:39,431
Troy, stop her.

809
00:42:39,474 --> 00:42:40,975
How?

810
00:42:41,017 --> 00:42:44,979
Do you believe in magic?

811
00:42:45,021 --> 00:42:47,690
Well, Buck Howard is here

812
00:42:47,732 --> 00:42:49,692
He's gonna give a great show

813
00:42:49,734 --> 00:42:51,735
So you don't have to fear

814
00:42:51,778 --> 00:42:54,321
There'll be some magic

815
00:42:54,364 --> 00:42:56,615
And some mentalism too

816
00:42:56,658 --> 00:42:58,617
And if we're really lucky

817
00:42:58,660 --> 00:43:01,954
He might even play the pian-oo

818
00:43:01,997 --> 00:43:06,917
Do you believe in magic?

819
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:11,088
Do you believe
in ma-a-gic?

820
00:43:11,131 --> 00:43:17,052
Do you believe in ma-a-a-gic?

821
00:43:22,142 --> 00:43:25,311
Ladies and gentlemen,
the Great Buck Howard!

822
00:43:25,353 --> 00:43:28,856
Come on, Buck!

823
00:43:28,898 --> 00:43:31,567
The Great Buck Howard,
everybody!

824
00:43:38,908 --> 00:43:41,201
That was the most amateurish thing

825
00:43:41,244 --> 00:43:44,622
I've had to live
through in 40 years.

826
00:43:44,664 --> 00:43:46,832
She nearly ruined the show.

827
00:43:46,875 --> 00:43:50,502
There is a reason, Troy,
I am called the Great Buck Howard.

828
00:43:50,545 --> 00:43:54,214
Not the Okay Buck Howard,
not the not Bad Buck Howard,

829
00:43:54,257 --> 00:43:56,675
- the Great Buck Howard!
- I know. I'm sorry.

830
00:43:56,718 --> 00:43:59,970
I do not want to see
either of those people

831
00:44:00,013 --> 00:44:01,555
for the remainder of our stay here.

832
00:44:01,598 --> 00:44:04,058
We rent our own car, a cheap one,

833
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:06,226
and we drive ourselves around.

834
00:44:06,269 --> 00:44:08,062
- Do you understand?
- Okay.

835
00:44:08,104 --> 00:44:11,690
I barely got this show
back tonight, Troy.

836
00:44:11,733 --> 00:44:14,860
The audience thought
we were clowns.

837
00:44:14,903 --> 00:44:17,655
And by the way,
you are partially to blame.

838
00:44:17,697 --> 00:44:19,531
Buck, there is no way
I could have known

839
00:44:19,574 --> 00:44:21,200
that she was gonna pull that.

840
00:44:21,242 --> 00:44:23,035
Yes, that's true.
You only could have known

841
00:44:23,078 --> 00:44:25,037
if you were someone
who is observant.

842
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:29,208
But you're clearly not
someone who is observant.

843
00:44:29,250 --> 00:44:31,877
Could you leave
my dressing room, please?

844
00:44:40,178 --> 00:44:44,014
- He seemed really pissed.
- He was.

845
00:44:46,142 --> 00:44:48,602
She just wanted to sing,
man, you know?

846
00:44:48,645 --> 00:44:51,897
Kenny, I don't know
what to tell you,

847
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:55,359
but this is the way it's gotta be.

848
00:44:57,028 --> 00:44:58,320
Yeah.

849
00:45:00,323 --> 00:45:02,324
He wanted you to have
one of these, though.

850
00:45:07,664 --> 00:45:09,665
Now that's class.

851
00:45:12,168 --> 00:45:15,087
We mess up his whole show,

852
00:45:15,130 --> 00:45:17,631
but he's still got enough goodness

853
00:45:17,674 --> 00:45:21,009
to give me a really cool picture.

854
00:45:22,804 --> 00:45:25,139
I will treasure this, Troy.

855
00:45:25,181 --> 00:45:26,640
I know you will.

856
00:45:39,404 --> 00:45:41,363
Who's this guy?

857
00:45:41,406 --> 00:45:44,575
That's Alan.
He was Buck's road manager before me.

858
00:45:44,617 --> 00:45:46,577
There's like
a whole section about him.

859
00:45:46,619 --> 00:45:48,287
Buck is gonna die
when he sees this.

860
00:45:48,329 --> 00:45:50,289
It's hard to feel bad for him.

861
00:45:50,331 --> 00:45:52,541
He has this face
you just want to punch.

862
00:45:54,085 --> 00:45:56,044
How does he do
the things in his act?

863
00:45:56,087 --> 00:45:58,005
I mean, how does
he find the money?

864
00:45:58,047 --> 00:46:00,257
- And I know you know.
- I don't know.

865
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:02,176
I heard he has a guy
who travels around with him

866
00:46:02,218 --> 00:46:04,511
and he slips into the audience
and he tells him where the money is.

867
00:46:06,389 --> 00:46:08,348
How? When?
He's being watched the whole time.

868
00:46:08,391 --> 00:46:10,184
- He has a hearing aid.
- He does not have a hearing aid.

869
00:46:10,226 --> 00:46:13,520
Besides, that is impractical.

870
00:46:13,563 --> 00:46:16,482
Buck would have to have
someone on payroll year round,

871
00:46:16,524 --> 00:46:19,109
and he's too much
of a cheapskate for that.

872
00:46:19,152 --> 00:46:21,612
You're cute,

873
00:46:21,654 --> 00:46:25,365
'cause you like believing
he's real, don't you?

874
00:46:25,408 --> 00:46:29,661
I cannot wait for
this weekend to be over.

875
00:46:31,456 --> 00:46:34,708
Not that it...
I didn't mean about...

876
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:36,460
I just hate working with...

877
00:46:36,503 --> 00:46:38,003
you're great. This has been...

878
00:46:38,046 --> 00:46:39,546
It's okay. It's okay.

879
00:46:39,589 --> 00:46:42,007
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't even be here.

880
00:46:42,050 --> 00:46:44,009
I should just...

881
00:46:44,052 --> 00:46:46,720
go back to my...

882
00:46:46,763 --> 00:46:48,722
room.

883
00:46:48,765 --> 00:46:50,265
Right?

884
00:46:57,398 --> 00:46:59,566
Yeah, you should
just go to your room.

885
00:46:59,609 --> 00:47:03,570
Go ahead. Go.
I'll see you in the morning.

886
00:47:03,613 --> 00:47:04,947
What?

887
00:47:04,989 --> 00:47:06,949
- Go to your room.
- Troy, I...

888
00:47:06,991 --> 00:47:08,909
I was just... are you...?

889
00:47:11,788 --> 00:47:13,539
No, stay.

890
00:47:13,581 --> 00:47:15,541
A night on my own
in Cincinnati...

891
00:47:15,583 --> 00:47:17,084
By this point,

892
00:47:17,126 --> 00:47:19,211
all I could really think
was one thing...

893
00:47:19,254 --> 00:47:23,006
thank God I did not quit
this job before Cincinnati.

894
00:47:23,049 --> 00:47:25,926
The town hadn't been
as kind to Buck, though.

895
00:47:25,969 --> 00:47:29,972
But that didn't matter, because the
whole weekend was about his big effect.

896
00:47:30,014 --> 00:47:32,808
Buck was counting on it
to change everything for him.

897
00:47:32,851 --> 00:47:35,602
And on the day,
it looked like it just might.

898
00:47:35,645 --> 00:47:37,104
You're very good at what you do,

899
00:47:37,146 --> 00:47:38,772
'cause this is a lot of people.

900
00:47:38,815 --> 00:47:40,607
There's like 300 so far,

901
00:47:40,650 --> 00:47:42,359
and the press turnout's great.

902
00:47:42,402 --> 00:47:43,944
So yeah, if you just tell him

903
00:47:43,987 --> 00:47:45,445
to go get ready, we're good.

904
00:47:45,488 --> 00:47:47,447
Okay.

905
00:47:47,490 --> 00:47:50,450
Thank you ma'am. Hi, just sign here
and make your way...

906
00:48:02,797 --> 00:48:07,175
Thank you. Silence, please.
I need complete silence.

907
00:48:07,218 --> 00:48:11,597
I have already begun
to take a mental picture

908
00:48:11,639 --> 00:48:14,474
of each and every one of you here.

909
00:48:14,517 --> 00:48:17,477
If I feel you are not suited

910
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:19,813
to this task,

911
00:48:19,856 --> 00:48:22,107
I will tap you on the shoulder

912
00:48:22,150 --> 00:48:24,902
and for your own safety

913
00:48:24,944 --> 00:48:28,488
you will go off to one side,

914
00:48:28,531 --> 00:48:32,826
where you will become
an observer

915
00:48:32,869 --> 00:48:36,330
and no longer a participant.

916
00:48:45,715 --> 00:48:47,674
Please focus on me.

917
00:48:47,717 --> 00:48:50,510
Let no outside stimuli

918
00:48:50,553 --> 00:48:53,931
break this little bubble
we've formed between us.

919
00:48:58,519 --> 00:49:02,022
This is getting to be
the ideal group.

920
00:49:02,065 --> 00:49:04,024
We're almost ready to begin.

921
00:49:04,067 --> 00:49:07,235
Stop.

922
00:49:14,494 --> 00:49:18,038
Members of the press,
we're delighted that you're here,

923
00:49:18,081 --> 00:49:21,416
but in order to ensure
your ability to cover this event,

924
00:49:21,459 --> 00:49:25,545
I urge you not to listen
too carefully to what I am going to say.

925
00:49:25,588 --> 00:49:27,881
Please. Now, let us begin.

926
00:49:27,924 --> 00:49:31,426
Ladies and gentlemen,
listen to the sound of my voice

927
00:49:31,469 --> 00:49:33,053
and only my voice.

928
00:49:33,096 --> 00:49:36,056
I will now count from one to 20.

929
00:49:36,099 --> 00:49:40,394
While I am counting, you will slowly
feel yourselves becoming tired.

930
00:49:40,436 --> 00:49:44,398
In fact, more than tired.
You will feel exhausted.

931
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:46,066
But this is good.

932
00:49:46,109 --> 00:49:48,568
You have come
to the right place.

933
00:49:48,611 --> 00:49:53,115
This is the ideal locale
to lie down and take a rest.

934
00:49:53,157 --> 00:49:56,994
If you decide to lower yourselves

935
00:49:57,036 --> 00:49:58,870
down to the ground,

936
00:49:58,913 --> 00:50:01,873
be my guest. One, two,

937
00:50:01,916 --> 00:50:03,834
three, four...

938
00:50:03,876 --> 00:50:05,836
Hey hey.

939
00:50:05,878 --> 00:50:09,214
six, seven...

940
00:50:09,257 --> 00:50:11,216
eight, nine...

941
00:50:11,259 --> 00:50:13,802
- Where are you going?
- 10...

942
00:50:13,845 --> 00:50:16,179
Where are you all going?
Somebody has to stay here.

943
00:50:16,222 --> 00:50:18,098
11, 12...

944
00:50:18,141 --> 00:50:20,225
Jerry Springer has had
some frickin' accident

945
00:50:20,268 --> 00:50:22,102
and everyone's leaving to cover it.

946
00:50:22,145 --> 00:50:24,104
- Did you say Jerry Springer?
- 15...

947
00:50:24,147 --> 00:50:26,606
Jerry Springer used
to be like the mayor of Cincinnati...

948
00:50:26,649 --> 00:50:29,443
- 17...
- Are they gonna come back?

949
00:50:29,485 --> 00:50:32,362
- Where was the accident? Was it close?
- Columbia Parkway.

950
00:50:32,405 --> 00:50:33,780
It was close.

951
00:50:33,823 --> 00:50:37,325
20.

952
00:50:39,620 --> 00:50:41,121
Jeez, he did it.

953
00:50:52,050 --> 00:50:56,845
Jerry Springer got into
a car accident on the Columbia Parkway

954
00:50:56,888 --> 00:50:59,973
and they all got
called away to cover it.

955
00:51:00,016 --> 00:51:04,853
- Who?
- Jerry Springer.

956
00:51:04,896 --> 00:51:07,898
He was on a TV show a while back.
It was kind of a big thing.

957
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:12,319
Prior to his TV show
he was the mayor of Cincinnati,

958
00:51:12,361 --> 00:51:14,321
so he's kind of popular here.

959
00:51:14,363 --> 00:51:18,909
It's this pin. It is cursed!

960
00:51:22,997 --> 00:51:24,790
Let's go.

961
00:51:24,832 --> 00:51:27,417
I give up.

962
00:51:27,460 --> 00:51:29,503
Buck...

963
00:51:32,006 --> 00:51:33,173
What?

964
00:51:36,719 --> 00:51:38,386
These people are still asleep.

965
00:51:52,568 --> 00:51:54,569
Wake up.

966
00:51:56,072 --> 00:51:57,072
Wake up.

967
00:51:59,158 --> 00:52:01,076
Wake up!

968
00:52:02,703 --> 00:52:07,541
Wake up.

969
00:52:16,843 --> 00:52:19,761
Make your way,
thank you very much for coming.

970
00:52:22,515 --> 00:52:25,100
Buck, I'm really sorry
about your thing, it's...

971
00:52:25,143 --> 00:52:27,435
Let me get this straight...

972
00:52:27,478 --> 00:52:31,106
the entire local press corps had
to leave to cover a traffic accident?

973
00:52:31,149 --> 00:52:32,566
Yeah, uh... yeah.

974
00:52:32,608 --> 00:52:34,943
Why didn't you get
the national press here

975
00:52:34,986 --> 00:52:37,404
as I asked?
They wouldn't have had to leave.

976
00:52:37,446 --> 00:52:40,073
I tried and I couldn't
get any to come.

977
00:52:40,116 --> 00:52:42,576
No, I'm sure you couldn't,
because you were so busy

978
00:52:42,618 --> 00:52:46,371
servicing Troy's needs
that you couldn't service mine.

979
00:52:46,414 --> 00:52:48,582
- Buck!
- Don't say a word.

980
00:52:48,624 --> 00:52:52,169
I've just performed
one of the most stunning feats

981
00:52:52,211 --> 00:52:54,087
in the history of mentalism,

982
00:52:54,130 --> 00:52:56,756
and there was no one to see it.

983
00:52:56,799 --> 00:52:59,467
This was going to change
everything for me.

984
00:52:59,510 --> 00:53:03,763
The two of you have delayed
my resurgence by months.

985
00:53:03,806 --> 00:53:07,267
And I will have you fired
tomorrow morning, I promise you.

986
00:53:07,310 --> 00:53:09,186
Let's go, Troy.

987
00:53:11,647 --> 00:53:13,273
I wasn't gonna give you this,

988
00:53:13,316 --> 00:53:17,861
didn't want to be the one.

989
00:53:17,904 --> 00:53:21,907
But now I just don't care.

990
00:53:21,949 --> 00:53:23,158
Goodbye, Buck.

991
00:53:26,537 --> 00:53:28,205
Buck, you can't just...

992
00:53:29,707 --> 00:53:32,626
forget it. Valerie!

993
00:53:55,942 --> 00:53:58,818
- Valerie, wait.
- I just want to get out of here, okay?

994
00:53:58,861 --> 00:54:01,863
- My blood is boiling.
- I don't blame you.

995
00:54:01,906 --> 00:54:04,866
I'm done, Troy. Never in my life
have I been spoken to...

996
00:54:04,909 --> 00:54:06,993
- I'm done.
- I know. Me too.

997
00:54:20,549 --> 00:54:23,218
Excuse me.

998
00:54:23,261 --> 00:54:26,471
One, two, three, four, five,

999
00:54:26,514 --> 00:54:28,515
one, two,
three, four, five,

1000
00:54:28,557 --> 00:54:31,101
one, two, three,
four, five...

1001
00:54:38,067 --> 00:54:40,485
He's fine. We're gonna keep him
overnight and run some tests,

1002
00:54:40,528 --> 00:54:42,487
but I think it was
just exhaustion.

1003
00:54:42,530 --> 00:54:44,864
Really?
So he's gonna be okay?

1004
00:54:44,907 --> 00:54:46,741
Well, he did pinch a nerve.

1005
00:54:46,784 --> 00:54:48,535
Whoever gave him C.P.R.
didn't know what they were doing.

1006
00:54:48,577 --> 00:54:50,620
Thank you.

1007
00:55:00,965 --> 00:55:04,050
- This is it.
- yeah.

1008
00:55:04,093 --> 00:55:06,386
Yeah.

1009
00:55:06,429 --> 00:55:09,139
It's been really nice
being with you, Troy,

1010
00:55:09,181 --> 00:55:11,057
you know, and...

1011
00:55:11,100 --> 00:55:15,270
just... you know,
I'm in L.A. all the time

1012
00:55:15,313 --> 00:55:18,231
and maybe I'll call you sometime,
you know, when I'm...

1013
00:55:18,274 --> 00:55:20,108
in L.A.

1014
00:55:22,111 --> 00:55:24,779
- Have a safe trip.
- Okay.

1015
00:55:38,085 --> 00:55:39,419
One thing... you...

1016
00:55:39,462 --> 00:55:41,421
you've gotta quit this job.

1017
00:55:41,464 --> 00:55:43,256
You know you can do better,

1018
00:55:43,299 --> 00:55:46,426
and I know people.
I could probably help.

1019
00:55:48,179 --> 00:55:50,055
- Okay?
- Okay.

1020
00:55:50,097 --> 00:55:54,100
It is over for Buck
and everyone knows it but him.

1021
00:56:19,835 --> 00:56:22,128
No, it's not life-threatening.

1022
00:56:22,171 --> 00:56:24,005
He just fainted.

1023
00:56:24,048 --> 00:56:26,007
Look, my wife said
she's leaving me

1024
00:56:26,050 --> 00:56:28,051
if I let a client ruin
another vacation.

1025
00:56:28,094 --> 00:56:31,262
I can't go unless his life
is in imminent danger.

1026
00:56:31,305 --> 00:56:33,264
Gil, what am
I supposed to do here?

1027
00:56:33,307 --> 00:56:35,058
What do you mean?

1028
00:56:35,101 --> 00:56:38,061
Isn't there someone
I should call or notify?

1029
00:56:38,104 --> 00:56:40,647
No. Troy, there's no one.

1030
00:56:40,689 --> 00:56:42,190
It's just you.

1031
00:56:48,406 --> 00:56:49,697
Okay.

1032
00:56:59,125 --> 00:57:02,502
I am going to sue
that human rectum Edward

1033
00:57:02,545 --> 00:57:04,671
and his disgusting magazine

1034
00:57:04,713 --> 00:57:06,339
right out of business.

1035
00:57:06,382 --> 00:57:08,091
They were deceptive, malicious,

1036
00:57:08,134 --> 00:57:12,512
not to mention I was supposed
to be on the cover.

1037
00:57:15,683 --> 00:57:18,351
I'm sorry about some
of the things I said.

1038
00:57:18,394 --> 00:57:21,729
I was very upset.
It wasn't you.

1039
00:57:23,607 --> 00:57:25,358
I never told anyone this,

1040
00:57:25,401 --> 00:57:28,736
but I did do
"The Tonight Show" 61 times,

1041
00:57:28,779 --> 00:57:33,158
but I didn't appear once
in Johnny's last 10 years.

1042
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:35,952
I have no idea why.

1043
00:57:35,995 --> 00:57:40,874
They just stopped calling.
No one ever explained.

1044
00:57:40,916 --> 00:57:43,585
Even at the end
when Johnny was retiring,

1045
00:57:43,627 --> 00:57:47,005
I kept hoping that he'd call
for one last show,

1046
00:57:47,047 --> 00:57:49,215
but he never did.

1047
00:57:49,258 --> 00:57:54,179
That's actually when I realized
that it was probably over for me.

1048
00:57:54,221 --> 00:57:58,391
I've been denying it ever since.

1049
00:57:58,434 --> 00:58:00,143
It's exhausting.

1050
00:58:01,937 --> 00:58:03,688
You still entertain
a lot of people, Buck.

1051
00:58:03,731 --> 00:58:05,690
You still put on a good show.

1052
00:58:05,733 --> 00:58:08,568
A good show. A good show.

1053
00:58:08,611 --> 00:58:12,697
How are we today, Mister...

1054
00:58:12,740 --> 00:58:13,740
Howard?

1055
00:58:13,782 --> 00:58:16,367
Horrible!

1056
00:58:16,410 --> 00:58:18,369
How's Gary Singer?

1057
00:58:18,412 --> 00:58:20,914
You mean Jerry Springer.
Very well.

1058
00:58:20,956 --> 00:58:23,082
It was a minor accident.

1059
00:58:23,125 --> 00:58:24,751
He checked out last night.

1060
00:58:24,793 --> 00:58:26,753
I'm sorry to hear that.

1061
00:58:29,465 --> 00:58:31,508
Seeing Buck like this was hard.

1062
00:58:31,550 --> 00:58:33,510
Despite everything,
I'd come to feel

1063
00:58:33,552 --> 00:58:36,137
not exactly affection for him,

1064
00:58:36,180 --> 00:58:38,139
but something like it.

1065
00:58:38,182 --> 00:58:39,682
This was the end, though,

1066
00:58:39,725 --> 00:58:41,601
and just like Valerie had said,

1067
00:58:41,644 --> 00:58:43,853
it was over for Buck.

1068
00:58:43,896 --> 00:58:45,939
Legendary performer
and mentalist Buck Howard

1069
00:58:45,981 --> 00:58:49,442
collapsed and was rushed
to University Hospital yesterday.

1070
00:58:49,485 --> 00:58:51,444
Conflicting reports suggest
that Mr. Howard suffered

1071
00:58:51,487 --> 00:58:53,863
somewhat of
a mental breakdown

1072
00:58:53,906 --> 00:58:57,784
after setting a new world record
in a stunning performance...

1073
00:58:57,826 --> 00:58:59,702
...is best known
for his many appearances

1074
00:58:59,745 --> 00:59:01,704
on "The Tonight Show
with Johnny Carson"...

1075
00:59:01,747 --> 00:59:04,123
Our reporter Judd McKinley
was on hand yesterday

1076
00:59:04,166 --> 00:59:05,959
and got this eyewitness footage.

1077
00:59:06,001 --> 00:59:09,754
And Mr. Howard,
he seemed totally out of it...

1078
00:59:09,797 --> 00:59:11,798
Delivery for Mr. Howard.

1079
00:59:15,553 --> 00:59:18,471
Call Gil and tell him
I'm in imminent danger.

1080
00:59:18,514 --> 00:59:20,139
He'll know what it means.

1081
00:59:20,182 --> 00:59:23,226
This train is leaving the station

1082
00:59:23,269 --> 00:59:25,895
and we've got to be on it.

1083
00:59:25,938 --> 00:59:29,649
And bring these bouquets.
They're worth a lot of money.

1084
00:59:29,692 --> 00:59:31,943
The legendary mentalist
Buck Howard,

1085
00:59:31,986 --> 00:59:35,321
best known for his many appearances on
"The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson,"

1086
00:59:35,364 --> 00:59:39,325
checked himself out of a hospital
in Cincinnati on Monday,

1087
00:59:39,368 --> 00:59:41,327
after the completion
of a highly taxing stunt

1088
00:59:41,370 --> 00:59:44,122
where he put some
800 people to sleep.

1089
00:59:44,164 --> 00:59:46,916
Mary Hart was just the beginning.

1090
00:59:46,959 --> 00:59:48,501
No one could have predicted it,

1091
00:59:48,544 --> 00:59:51,129
but suddenly Buck was hip.

1092
00:59:51,171 --> 00:59:53,131
David, it's great
to have you on T.R.L.

1093
00:59:53,173 --> 00:59:54,424
Everyone's enjoying you here.

1094
00:59:54,466 --> 00:59:56,593
We do have a big
surprise for you here.

1095
00:59:56,635 --> 00:59:58,428
We're gonna bring him out.

1096
00:59:58,470 --> 01:00:02,765
Ladies and gentlemen,
the Great Buck Howard! Come on out!

1097
01:00:02,808 --> 01:00:04,642
I love this town!

1098
01:00:04,685 --> 01:00:07,854
And I love this man,
David Blainefield!

1099
01:00:07,896 --> 01:00:11,274
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

1100
01:00:11,317 --> 01:00:13,943
Why don't we just
mentally shake hands?

1101
01:00:15,863 --> 01:00:19,741
Do you have insight
into the mindset of the kids today?

1102
01:00:19,783 --> 01:00:21,034
What's your take on kids today?

1103
01:00:21,076 --> 01:00:23,870
I suppose I have
some degree of insight,

1104
01:00:23,912 --> 01:00:26,414
and I have one major worry,

1105
01:00:26,457 --> 01:00:29,584
and that worry can be
summed up in one word:

1106
01:00:29,627 --> 01:00:31,794
drugs.

1107
01:00:33,797 --> 01:00:37,467
Today we'll be preparing
one of Buck Howard's original recipes

1108
01:00:37,509 --> 01:00:40,136
from his new book,
"Mentally Cooked."

1109
01:00:40,179 --> 01:00:42,889
Since this picture was taken, it looks
like you've had a little work done,

1110
01:00:42,931 --> 01:00:46,017
- around the eyes, I think.
- No, nothing's changed.

1111
01:00:46,060 --> 01:00:47,894
You don't have to be
defensive about it.

1112
01:00:47,936 --> 01:00:50,229
- No, I don't.
- A lot of people have work done.

1113
01:00:50,272 --> 01:00:52,106
But not me.

1114
01:00:52,149 --> 01:00:54,734
Now, Buck, this is quite incredible.
You're hip now.

1115
01:00:54,777 --> 01:00:56,069
Are you aware that you're hip?

1116
01:00:56,111 --> 01:00:58,404
I'm aware that I'm hip,

1117
01:00:58,447 --> 01:00:59,989
and I have to say, Colin,

1118
01:01:00,032 --> 01:01:02,200
- I've always been hip.
- It's Conan.

1119
01:01:02,242 --> 01:01:03,868
Oh, right.

1120
01:01:08,165 --> 01:01:09,707
I love this town!

1121
01:01:10,793 --> 01:01:13,503
Buck, how are you? Whoa!

1122
01:01:14,963 --> 01:01:16,297
Wow!

1123
01:01:19,134 --> 01:01:21,094
Buck, it's good to have you here.

1124
01:01:21,136 --> 01:01:23,596
- It's great to be back.
- Oh my gosh, yes indeed.

1125
01:01:23,639 --> 01:01:25,264
I don't think I'll be the same.

1126
01:01:25,307 --> 01:01:28,226
Buck, I've got a friend
of yours backstage

1127
01:01:28,268 --> 01:01:30,478
who you haven't seen
in quite a while now.

1128
01:01:30,521 --> 01:01:32,105
So I'm gonna bring him out
right now. You ready?

1129
01:01:32,147 --> 01:01:34,857
Ladies and gentlemen,
George Takei!

1130
01:01:42,449 --> 01:01:45,743
What the world
needs now

1131
01:01:45,786 --> 01:01:50,456
Is love, sweet love

1132
01:01:50,499 --> 01:01:52,250
It's the only thing...

1133
01:01:52,292 --> 01:01:54,252
- I love this man!
- That there's

1134
01:01:54,294 --> 01:01:57,171
Just too little of.

1135
01:01:59,675 --> 01:02:01,884
In the wake
of this whole crazy circus,

1136
01:02:01,927 --> 01:02:04,637
the call came in that Buck
had been waiting for.

1137
01:02:04,680 --> 01:02:07,348
It was Vegas. There was talk
of a headline spot,

1138
01:02:07,391 --> 01:02:09,183
even a long-term deal.

1139
01:02:09,226 --> 01:02:11,269
But now, Buck
wouldn't hear of it.

1140
01:02:11,311 --> 01:02:14,522
And why would he?
He was beyond Vegas.

1141
01:02:14,565 --> 01:02:16,858
He was bigger
than he had ever been,

1142
01:02:16,900 --> 01:02:19,444
and he was about to make
a triumphant return to the place

1143
01:02:19,486 --> 01:02:21,320
where it had all started for him.

1144
01:02:21,363 --> 01:02:24,240
It's "The Tonight Show
with Jay Leno,"

1145
01:02:24,283 --> 01:02:27,326
featuring Kevin Eubanks
and the Tonight Show band.

1146
01:02:27,369 --> 01:02:30,079
Tonight, Jay welcomes
Tom Arnold,

1147
01:02:30,122 --> 01:02:33,499
mentalist Buck Howard...

1148
01:02:33,542 --> 01:02:35,501
okay.

1149
01:02:35,544 --> 01:02:41,048
And now, Jay Leno!

1150
01:02:41,091 --> 01:02:43,301
...you're right. I can't tell you.

1151
01:02:43,343 --> 01:02:45,011
- We're about out of time.
- Okay okay.

1152
01:02:45,053 --> 01:02:46,679
Do you even have
anything to promote?

1153
01:02:46,722 --> 01:02:48,347
No, I just came to hang out.

1154
01:02:48,390 --> 01:02:49,599
You're not
at the Chuckle Hut next week?

1155
01:02:49,641 --> 01:02:51,392
No, I just got nowhere to go.

1156
01:02:51,435 --> 01:02:53,519
Tom, we gotta go.
My apologies to magician Buck Howard.

1157
01:02:53,562 --> 01:02:54,937
We were not able to
bring him on tonight,

1158
01:02:54,980 --> 01:02:57,148
we were having so much
fun with Tom,

1159
01:02:57,191 --> 01:02:59,525
time got away with us.
We'll have him back at another time.

1160
01:02:59,568 --> 01:03:01,944
Good night. Stay tuned for Conan,
coming up next. Good night, everybody!

1161
01:03:01,987 --> 01:03:06,282
So, I'm bumped for Tom Arnold.

1162
01:03:06,325 --> 01:03:08,743
I don't even know who that is.

1163
01:03:10,537 --> 01:03:12,163
Hey, Buck,
I am so sorry, man.

1164
01:03:12,206 --> 01:03:13,831
My wife left me for a rich guy

1165
01:03:13,874 --> 01:03:15,416
and my mom got busted
for crystal meth,

1166
01:03:15,459 --> 01:03:17,418
so I had a lot of funny material.

1167
01:03:17,461 --> 01:03:18,836
It just kept going on.

1168
01:03:18,879 --> 01:03:20,338
You inspired me
to come to Hollywood.

1169
01:03:20,380 --> 01:03:22,340
Do you remember this?
1978, Ottumwa, Iowa,

1170
01:03:22,382 --> 01:03:24,675
the coliseum?
You signed this for me. You rocked.

1171
01:03:24,718 --> 01:03:26,427
Excuse me.
Buck, Jay wanted me to tell you

1172
01:03:26,470 --> 01:03:28,554
he's very sorry.
It couldn't be helped.

1173
01:03:28,597 --> 01:03:31,390
- Buck. Buck.
- Thank you, Buck. You rocked!

1174
01:03:31,433 --> 01:03:34,685
Come on, you're not the first person
in the world to get bumped.

1175
01:03:34,728 --> 01:03:36,687
We want to have
you on next week.

1176
01:03:36,730 --> 01:03:39,899
Do you know how many times
I did "The Tonight Show"?

1177
01:03:39,942 --> 01:03:43,736
61. Do you know how many times
Johnny Carson bumped me?

1178
01:03:43,779 --> 01:03:46,572
Zero. None. Nada.

1179
01:03:46,615 --> 01:03:50,785
You can tell Jay to take
his apology and shove it!

1180
01:03:50,828 --> 01:03:54,163
Do you want to be on
the show next week or not?

1181
01:03:54,206 --> 01:03:56,749
That man is Satan.

1182
01:03:56,792 --> 01:04:01,128
And Buck Howard
does not work with Satan.

1183
01:04:08,178 --> 01:04:11,347
Gil, call Vegas.
Let's hear what they have to say.

1184
01:04:28,490 --> 01:04:29,949
Hello hello.

1185
01:04:29,992 --> 01:04:31,701
Hi.

1186
01:04:33,453 --> 01:04:34,495
Hello.

1187
01:04:35,664 --> 01:04:37,039
Hey.

1188
01:04:40,669 --> 01:04:43,296
Welcome back to Vegas, Buck!

1189
01:04:43,338 --> 01:04:45,298
- Thank you.
- Hey. Dan Green.

1190
01:04:45,340 --> 01:04:46,632
Nice to meet you, Dan.

1191
01:04:46,675 --> 01:04:49,135
Michael Perry... oh, wow.
Quite a handshake.

1192
01:04:49,177 --> 01:04:52,555
The old Buck Howard handshake.
That's fantastic.

1193
01:04:52,598 --> 01:04:55,266
By the way, a great job
on the Stewarts... Jon and Martha.

1194
01:04:55,309 --> 01:04:56,684
Unbelievable, really.

1195
01:04:56,727 --> 01:04:58,811
- Good exposure for you.
- Buck, you look great.

1196
01:04:58,854 --> 01:05:01,063
- I mean the whole... the...
- Very fresh.

1197
01:05:01,106 --> 01:05:02,648
- It's got a...
- Yeah, it's terrific.

1198
01:05:02,691 --> 01:05:04,901
Listen, I'm gonna jump in.

1199
01:05:04,943 --> 01:05:07,403
Buck, as Gil already knows,
we've been courting you.

1200
01:05:07,446 --> 01:05:09,447
After the comeback you've had
we think Vegas is

1201
01:05:09,489 --> 01:05:11,532
- the perfect place for you.
- Perfect.

1202
01:05:11,575 --> 01:05:13,951
We don't mean
to offend at all, but we did

1203
01:05:13,994 --> 01:05:16,203
- conduct some initial research...
- Yeah, and so Gilly sent us

1204
01:05:16,246 --> 01:05:18,915
a few tapes, and we screened them
for a focus group, and...

1205
01:05:18,957 --> 01:05:21,584
Yeah. The magic-slash-mentalist
part of the show

1206
01:05:21,627 --> 01:05:23,502
where you're doing the hypnosis

1207
01:05:23,545 --> 01:05:25,171
and you're looking for your money

1208
01:05:25,213 --> 01:05:27,840
- scored really high.
- Yeah, through the roof.

1209
01:05:27,883 --> 01:05:31,594
However, the piano and the standup
portion of your show...

1210
01:05:31,637 --> 01:05:35,514
- Mmm, not so much.
- A little more on the lower end.

1211
01:05:35,557 --> 01:05:38,267
- Yeah. Not bad...
- No, not awful.

1212
01:05:38,310 --> 01:05:40,186
Just... a... little...

1213
01:05:40,228 --> 01:05:42,104
Any thoughts?

1214
01:05:42,147 --> 01:05:45,775
Well, I, um...

1215
01:05:45,817 --> 01:05:48,402
I want to get back to Vegas,

1216
01:05:48,445 --> 01:05:51,948
and it's not that
I don't find it sickening

1217
01:05:51,990 --> 01:05:56,243
that people don't like
the standup and the piano,

1218
01:05:56,286 --> 01:05:58,829
but I'm open for suggestion.

1219
01:05:58,872 --> 01:06:01,415
- Ah.
- Great. Okay.

1220
01:06:01,458 --> 01:06:03,209
- That's what we wanted to hear.
- That's where we were headed.

1221
01:06:03,251 --> 01:06:04,543
That's Teddy.

1222
01:06:04,586 --> 01:06:06,462
I'll be right back.

1223
01:06:06,505 --> 01:06:08,798
We're not gonna change anything big.
It is the Buck Howard show.

1224
01:06:08,840 --> 01:06:10,758
Oh, Buck, I gotta tell you, my mom...

1225
01:06:10,801 --> 01:06:12,760
This was Buck's shot.

1226
01:06:12,803 --> 01:06:15,262
The hype had died down
and now this is what was left.

1227
01:06:15,305 --> 01:06:18,933
Maybe this is where Buck belonged...
back in Vegas,

1228
01:06:18,976 --> 01:06:21,060
with his name in bright lights.

1229
01:06:21,103 --> 01:06:23,229
Ladies and gentlemen,

1230
01:06:23,271 --> 01:06:26,607
get ready for a night
that will overwhelm your senses,

1231
01:06:26,650 --> 01:06:30,569
expand your mind,
and thrill your soul.

1232
01:06:30,612 --> 01:06:34,365
Presenting the Great Buck Howard!

1233
01:06:51,967 --> 01:06:54,510
And your number is...

1234
01:06:54,553 --> 01:06:57,763
- 17.
- Oh my God!

1235
01:06:57,806 --> 01:07:00,057
Show the crowd.

1236
01:07:00,100 --> 01:07:01,976
How 'bout that, folks?

1237
01:07:02,019 --> 01:07:03,602
Isn't that wild, folks?

1238
01:07:03,645 --> 01:07:06,188
Isn't that wild? It's wild!

1239
01:07:22,748 --> 01:07:25,958
Ladies and gentlemen,
in a few moments time

1240
01:07:26,001 --> 01:07:31,714
these fine citizens will wake up
with a snap of my finger.

1241
01:07:31,757 --> 01:07:35,843
They will believe someone has
removed all of their clothes...

1242
01:07:37,429 --> 01:07:39,555
and that they are standing
in front of you,

1243
01:07:39,598 --> 01:07:42,475
shall we say, buck naked.

1244
01:07:54,696 --> 01:07:57,406
Isn't that wild, folks?
Isn't that wild?

1245
01:08:05,248 --> 01:08:06,999
Gil, do you have a second?

1246
01:08:07,042 --> 01:08:08,751
Look, this could not be going better.

1247
01:08:08,794 --> 01:08:10,127
- Love it.
- We're really happy...

1248
01:08:10,170 --> 01:08:11,796
Now, ladies and gentlemen,

1249
01:08:11,838 --> 01:08:14,381
these two people
will come backstage with me

1250
01:08:14,424 --> 01:08:17,301
to keep an eye on me to make sure
there's no funny business,

1251
01:08:17,344 --> 01:08:21,514
and these two people
will hide my fee in cash

1252
01:08:21,556 --> 01:08:24,517
somewhere in this auditorium.

1253
01:08:24,559 --> 01:08:26,268
You have my fee.

1254
01:08:26,311 --> 01:08:28,270
All right, shall we?

1255
01:08:33,693 --> 01:08:36,278
Here we go. Man of the hour.

1256
01:08:36,321 --> 01:08:39,156
Great job, Buck.
It's going great.

1257
01:08:39,199 --> 01:08:41,992
Hey, Buck,
let me ask you something.

1258
01:08:42,035 --> 01:08:43,828
How do they work
this thing with your money?

1259
01:08:43,870 --> 01:08:45,204
What do you mean?

1260
01:08:45,247 --> 01:08:48,582
I assume the casino pays you
by the month, right?

1261
01:08:48,625 --> 01:08:50,584
So is that a week's
worth of cash out there?

1262
01:08:50,627 --> 01:08:52,920
- Honey, shh.
- What? I'm curious.

1263
01:08:52,963 --> 01:08:54,880
- Um...
- Excuse me. I'm sorry. Hi.

1264
01:08:54,923 --> 01:08:57,550
I work for the casinos, sir,
and it's a good question.

1265
01:08:57,592 --> 01:08:58,884
The agreement we have with Buck

1266
01:08:58,927 --> 01:09:00,678
is that if he's unable
to find the money,

1267
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:02,972
a pro-rated sum
for tonight's show only,

1268
01:09:03,014 --> 01:09:05,808
it is deducted from his salary
and donated to charity.

1269
01:09:05,851 --> 01:09:09,311
Boring!

1270
01:09:09,354 --> 01:09:12,773
- They're ready for you.
- Mr. Howard...

1271
01:09:12,816 --> 01:09:15,151
- We're here to party.
- ...they're ready for you.

1272
01:09:15,193 --> 01:09:18,070
- Gotta get out there!
- Go get 'em, Buck!

1273
01:09:18,113 --> 01:09:20,406
As I went back
to watch him finish the show,

1274
01:09:20,448 --> 01:09:23,868
I had this feeling that
it was time for me to move on.

1275
01:09:23,910 --> 01:09:27,788
I was Buck's road manager,
and his days on the road were over.

1276
01:09:27,831 --> 01:09:30,374
Now for this next effect

1277
01:09:30,417 --> 01:09:32,835
I will need complete silence,

1278
01:09:32,878 --> 01:09:36,505
absolute concentration.
Thank you.

1279
01:09:38,466 --> 01:09:41,385
Two-year deal. Buck did it.

1280
01:09:41,428 --> 01:09:43,262
Yes, his show had changed...

1281
01:09:43,305 --> 01:09:45,389
the doves, the scarves...

1282
01:09:45,432 --> 01:09:48,142
but it seemed like Buck was okay
with these compromises.

1283
01:09:50,478 --> 01:09:54,231
And despite it all,
his show still came down to this,

1284
01:09:54,274 --> 01:09:56,233
his signature effect,

1285
01:09:56,276 --> 01:09:58,319
the thing he had
always been known for.

1286
01:10:13,335 --> 01:10:15,419
Gil, is he all right?

1287
01:10:15,462 --> 01:10:17,338
Oh, just fine.

1288
01:10:26,181 --> 01:10:29,642
But then, suddenly,

1289
01:10:29,684 --> 01:10:33,896
for the first time
in a nearly 40-year career,

1290
01:10:37,067 --> 01:10:38,984
Buck couldn't find his money.

1291
01:10:45,575 --> 01:10:49,870
And just like that, it was over.

1292
01:11:14,604 --> 01:11:16,647
So here you are.

1293
01:11:19,484 --> 01:11:21,902
What are you gonna do now, kid?

1294
01:11:23,488 --> 01:11:26,782
Well, um,

1295
01:11:26,825 --> 01:11:28,784
I've been doing some writing.

1296
01:11:28,827 --> 01:11:32,162
Really?
Like for a newspaper?

1297
01:11:32,205 --> 01:11:34,873
No, different kind of writing.

1298
01:11:34,916 --> 01:11:39,044
Oh. You mean the kind
where they don't pay you.

1299
01:11:39,087 --> 01:11:42,965
Well, I'm hoping eventually,
but so far, yeah.

1300
01:11:43,008 --> 01:11:46,010
You don't remember because
you were a little kid.

1301
01:11:46,052 --> 01:11:49,555
But your mom and I,
we barely made it in the beginning.

1302
01:11:49,597 --> 01:11:52,266
- we struggled...
- So that I wouldn't have to.

1303
01:11:52,309 --> 01:11:54,476
Yes, I know.

1304
01:11:54,519 --> 01:11:57,146
That's right.
But I didn't have a choice.

1305
01:11:57,188 --> 01:11:58,355
You do.

1306
01:11:58,398 --> 01:12:01,025
So, how about this...

1307
01:12:01,067 --> 01:12:05,070
you come back home,
you save up your money,

1308
01:12:05,113 --> 01:12:07,531
you go back to school...
hear me out, now,

1309
01:12:07,574 --> 01:12:08,907
just hear me out.

1310
01:12:08,950 --> 01:12:11,076
Entertainment law.

1311
01:12:11,119 --> 01:12:13,454
- Entertainment law.
- Dad, stop.

1312
01:12:13,496 --> 01:12:15,914
I wish I could
go back to school.

1313
01:12:15,957 --> 01:12:19,418
I know that if I do,
I'd be set, but I can't.

1314
01:12:19,461 --> 01:12:22,254
I have to try this.

1315
01:12:22,297 --> 01:12:24,256
It might be a crazy dream.

1316
01:12:24,299 --> 01:12:27,343
I might fail miserably,

1317
01:12:27,385 --> 01:12:30,763
but I have to at least try.

1318
01:12:30,805 --> 01:12:35,726
Otherwise, I'm not going
to be happy at anything.

1319
01:12:40,482 --> 01:12:42,483
Okay.

1320
01:12:44,402 --> 01:12:46,362
Good luck.

1321
01:12:46,404 --> 01:12:50,657
You are aware that the word
"writer" rarely appears

1322
01:12:50,700 --> 01:12:52,743
without the word
"starving" in front of it.

1323
01:12:54,412 --> 01:12:57,623
So you better finish
your breakfast.

1324
01:12:57,665 --> 01:12:59,625
And then take me
to the airport.

1325
01:12:59,667 --> 01:13:01,627
I gotta get out of Los Angeles.

1326
01:13:04,214 --> 01:13:07,299
My dad was right.
I did need to make money.

1327
01:13:07,342 --> 01:13:09,093
But I had learned from Buck

1328
01:13:09,135 --> 01:13:11,178
that when you do
the thing you love,

1329
01:13:11,221 --> 01:13:16,100
somehow, magically,
you find the money.

1330
01:13:25,360 --> 01:13:27,986
- Hi. Hi.
- Hi.

1331
01:13:28,029 --> 01:13:29,988
- How are you?
- I'm good.

1332
01:13:30,031 --> 01:13:33,325
Wow, so yeah,
that's Jonathan Finerman.

1333
01:13:33,368 --> 01:13:36,245
Yes, you remember him?
His show just got picked up

1334
01:13:36,287 --> 01:13:37,955
and we've just been doing press
round the clock.

1335
01:13:37,997 --> 01:13:40,833
I grew up watching him.
He was huge.

1336
01:13:40,875 --> 01:13:43,085
But I still don't understand

1337
01:13:43,128 --> 01:13:45,838
why he would want
to meet with me.

1338
01:13:45,880 --> 01:13:49,466
The writer's assistant got fired,
and I just mentioned you.

1339
01:13:49,509 --> 01:13:52,428
Troy, this could be
so great for you.

1340
01:13:52,470 --> 01:13:54,430
Most of the assistants,
they make staff in like a year or two.

1341
01:13:54,472 --> 01:13:56,348
It would be really good.

1342
01:13:56,391 --> 01:13:59,810
I don't usually do this sort of thing,
but I had to meet you.

1343
01:13:59,853 --> 01:14:02,938
You used to work
for Buck Howard.

1344
01:14:02,981 --> 01:14:05,816
Yeah, I did.

1345
01:14:05,859 --> 01:14:08,235
I've been a fan of his
ever since I was a kid.

1346
01:14:08,278 --> 01:14:11,113
I also do a little
amateur magic myself.

1347
01:14:11,156 --> 01:14:15,075
There's always been something
I've been curious about,

1348
01:14:15,118 --> 01:14:16,869
not that it matters...

1349
01:14:16,911 --> 01:14:18,454
I don't know how
he finds the money.

1350
01:14:18,496 --> 01:14:20,664
That's not what
I was gonna ask.

1351
01:14:20,707 --> 01:14:22,291
Is he gay?

1352
01:14:22,333 --> 01:14:24,293
I'm just wondering.

1353
01:14:24,335 --> 01:14:25,961
I don't know.

1354
01:14:26,004 --> 01:14:29,548
I never saw him with anyone, so...

1355
01:14:29,591 --> 01:14:31,758
Yeah, well...

1356
01:14:31,801 --> 01:14:34,678
the thing about the money,
I found that out. That's a total scam.

1357
01:14:35,680 --> 01:14:38,015
Really? How?

1358
01:14:38,057 --> 01:14:40,893
He wears an earpiece.

1359
01:14:40,935 --> 01:14:43,270
I've heard about this.

1360
01:14:43,313 --> 01:14:46,773
And there's a guy that travels with him
that tells him where the money is.

1361
01:14:46,816 --> 01:14:48,817
I think I would have noticed.

1362
01:14:48,860 --> 01:14:50,819
He travels separate.

1363
01:14:50,862 --> 01:14:52,988
No one is even sure what
the guy looks like.

1364
01:14:53,031 --> 01:14:54,406
He sees where the money is,

1365
01:14:54,449 --> 01:14:57,075
goes to the restroom
or out to his car...

1366
01:14:57,118 --> 01:14:59,161
only takes a second...

1367
01:14:59,204 --> 01:15:02,372
whispers into a microphone,
it goes right into Buck's ear.

1368
01:15:02,415 --> 01:15:06,418
"Third row,
lady in the green sweater."

1369
01:15:06,461 --> 01:15:08,795
And his job is done.

1370
01:15:11,424 --> 01:15:13,467
No, I don't believe it.

1371
01:15:15,970 --> 01:15:17,763
You're loyal. I like that.

1372
01:15:21,267 --> 01:15:24,603
Who would have thought
that Buck Howard on your resume

1373
01:15:24,646 --> 01:15:26,772
- would land you a job?
- Not me.

1374
01:15:26,814 --> 01:15:29,191
And seriously,
thank you very much

1375
01:15:29,234 --> 01:15:31,985
- for arranging this. It went very well.
- Come on.

1376
01:15:32,028 --> 01:15:34,071
So, thank you. I mean it.

1377
01:15:36,282 --> 01:15:39,993
Okay, well, I'm over here.

1378
01:15:42,330 --> 01:15:46,041
So, that boyfriend of yours,
how's that working out?

1379
01:15:46,084 --> 01:15:49,795
And you ask just because
you're concerned about my well-being?

1380
01:15:49,837 --> 01:15:52,422
Yes, of course.

1381
01:15:52,465 --> 01:15:53,674
Of course
I'm very very concerned.

1382
01:15:58,805 --> 01:16:00,180
I'll call you.

1383
01:16:00,223 --> 01:16:02,140
Okay.

1384
01:16:03,476 --> 01:16:06,061
Preferably late at night, drunk.

1385
01:16:06,104 --> 01:16:08,313
Always!

1386
01:16:08,356 --> 01:16:10,857
Okay. Bye.

1387
01:16:10,900 --> 01:16:14,528
And just like that,
I began a whole new life.

1388
01:16:14,571 --> 01:16:18,282
Still, I thought
about Buck all the time.

1389
01:16:18,324 --> 01:16:21,785
He had just disappeared
after that night in Vegas.

1390
01:16:21,828 --> 01:16:25,497
I wondered what
exactly had gone wrong.

1391
01:16:25,540 --> 01:16:28,333
Buck had never failed
to find his money before.

1392
01:16:28,376 --> 01:16:30,335
It didn't make sense.

1393
01:16:30,378 --> 01:16:33,130
But then again,
maybe it proved he was real.

1394
01:16:33,172 --> 01:16:35,048
'Cause when you think about it,

1395
01:16:35,091 --> 01:16:38,802
only something fake could
work 100% of the time.

1396
01:16:38,845 --> 01:16:41,513
Regardless, I just wished there was
some way I could know that he was okay,

1397
01:16:41,556 --> 01:16:45,267
maybe talk to him one more time.

1398
01:17:10,501 --> 01:17:12,044
Come in.

1399
01:17:17,675 --> 01:17:21,762
- Hey, Buck.
- Troy! My goodness!

1400
01:17:21,804 --> 01:17:26,141
- How are you?
- I brought you something.

1401
01:17:26,184 --> 01:17:29,603
Look at that. Brandy.
That's very kind of you.

1402
01:17:29,646 --> 01:17:31,605
What are you doing here?

1403
01:17:31,648 --> 01:17:34,191
Just thought I'd take a trip up,
check out the show.

1404
01:17:34,233 --> 01:17:36,735
Come in.

1405
01:17:36,778 --> 01:17:38,028
Buck, it's 30 minutes to showtime.

1406
01:17:38,071 --> 01:17:40,656
Troy, this is Russell,
my new road manager.

1407
01:17:40,698 --> 01:17:44,159
Russell, Troy used to have yourjob,
but Troy understood

1408
01:17:44,202 --> 01:17:46,870
the importance of not looking
like a bum on the job.

1409
01:17:48,539 --> 01:17:49,831
Your tie.

1410
01:17:49,874 --> 01:17:52,042
You're not in a bar.

1411
01:17:52,085 --> 01:17:54,878
Come back when it's five minutes
and I need some water.

1412
01:17:54,921 --> 01:17:56,880
Actually, there is
some water right there.

1413
01:17:56,923 --> 01:17:58,882
That's distilled water.
I'm not an iron.

1414
01:17:58,925 --> 01:18:02,094
I drink spring water, remember?

1415
01:18:02,136 --> 01:18:04,262
Thank you.

1416
01:18:06,599 --> 01:18:10,352
So, you've come out of retirement.

1417
01:18:10,395 --> 01:18:13,271
Oh, I'll never give up, Troy.

1418
01:18:15,316 --> 01:18:17,776
So, why are you here?

1419
01:18:20,655 --> 01:18:22,656
What happened in Vegas?

1420
01:18:22,699 --> 01:18:24,950
Did you blow it on purpose?

1421
01:18:24,992 --> 01:18:27,953
Because that is the only explanation
that I can think of.

1422
01:18:27,995 --> 01:18:29,955
I know you wear an earpiece

1423
01:18:29,997 --> 01:18:33,959
and you have someone
in the audience

1424
01:18:34,001 --> 01:18:35,919
who tells you
where the money is.

1425
01:18:35,962 --> 01:18:39,965
Troy, that thing about the earpiece
has been going around for years.

1426
01:18:40,007 --> 01:18:41,383
It's a rumor.
Do you want to check?

1427
01:18:41,426 --> 01:18:43,510
No, it doesn't matter.

1428
01:18:43,553 --> 01:18:44,761
It's not important.

1429
01:18:44,804 --> 01:18:47,013
Look, I get it. It is a show.

1430
01:18:47,056 --> 01:18:48,306
You are there to entertain.

1431
01:18:48,349 --> 01:18:50,308
I understand.

1432
01:18:50,351 --> 01:18:52,811
I just want to know,
for myself.

1433
01:18:52,854 --> 01:18:55,480
What happened in Vegas?

1434
01:18:57,024 --> 01:19:00,902
You know, I don't really belong

1435
01:19:00,945 --> 01:19:02,904
in Vegas anymore.

1436
01:19:02,947 --> 01:19:05,657
I belong in places like these.

1437
01:19:07,034 --> 01:19:11,037
I love what I do.
I love these towns.

1438
01:19:11,080 --> 01:19:13,206
I love these people.

1439
01:19:13,249 --> 01:19:15,959
And I would never
cheat them, ever.

1440
01:19:18,546 --> 01:19:20,922
Watch the show tonight.

1441
01:19:23,551 --> 01:19:26,845
Thank you,
ladies and gentlemen.

1442
01:19:26,888 --> 01:19:31,057
I can't tell you how delighted
I am to be back in Bakersfield.

1443
01:19:31,100 --> 01:19:33,143
I love this town!

1444
01:19:33,186 --> 01:19:35,479
As I settled in
to watch Buck's show,

1445
01:19:35,521 --> 01:19:37,773
it struck me

1446
01:19:37,815 --> 01:19:40,150
this was the first time
I was seeing it as an audience member.

1447
01:19:40,193 --> 01:19:43,195
I want you to take
this piece of paper...

1448
01:19:43,237 --> 01:19:44,946
And it was his old show.

1449
01:19:44,989 --> 01:19:46,990
The changes he had made
in Vegas were gone

1450
01:19:47,033 --> 01:19:48,325
as if they had never happened.

1451
01:19:48,367 --> 01:19:50,994
And somehow it felt right.

1452
01:19:51,037 --> 01:19:52,996
It was actually kind of
beautiful in a way.

1453
01:19:53,039 --> 01:19:54,873
...because I know
what the number is.

1454
01:19:54,916 --> 01:19:57,626
The number you have
written down is the number 77.

1455
01:19:57,668 --> 01:19:59,377
Is that correct?

1456
01:19:59,420 --> 01:20:01,046
Show the audience.

1457
01:20:01,088 --> 01:20:02,380
Isn't that wild?

1458
01:20:02,423 --> 01:20:06,301
What the world needs now

1459
01:20:06,344 --> 01:20:08,887
Is love, sweet love...

1460
01:20:08,930 --> 01:20:12,641
When I tap them
on their left shoulder,

1461
01:20:12,683 --> 01:20:17,395
they will be sound asleep
in their chairs.

1462
01:20:17,438 --> 01:20:21,316
Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall...

1463
01:20:21,359 --> 01:20:25,570
Humpty Dumpty had
a great fall...

1464
01:20:27,532 --> 01:20:29,282
As the show neared its finale,

1465
01:20:29,325 --> 01:20:32,536
I saw that Buck had actually
made one small change.

1466
01:20:32,578 --> 01:20:34,538
And this one was just for me.

1467
01:20:34,580 --> 01:20:37,415
For many years
there have been rumors

1468
01:20:37,458 --> 01:20:41,127
that I employ some sort
of listening device

1469
01:20:41,170 --> 01:20:43,380
to aid me with this effect.

1470
01:20:43,422 --> 01:20:46,925
I would like to address
those rumors tonight.

1471
01:20:46,968 --> 01:20:49,344
Is there a doctor in the house?

1472
01:20:49,387 --> 01:20:51,137
Oh, there are two.

1473
01:20:51,180 --> 01:20:53,473
May I ask you both to come
onstage, please?

1474
01:20:55,935 --> 01:20:59,271
Take these instruments.
Please look in my ears

1475
01:20:59,313 --> 01:21:02,440
and tell the public
if I have any kind

1476
01:21:02,483 --> 01:21:05,318
of listening device whatsoever.

1477
01:21:07,697 --> 01:21:09,239
It's all clear.

1478
01:21:09,282 --> 01:21:11,032
Thank you.

1479
01:21:11,075 --> 01:21:13,118
Now, to convince

1480
01:21:13,160 --> 01:21:17,163
even the most hardened skeptics,

1481
01:21:17,206 --> 01:21:21,626
I will also put
this hood over my head.

1482
01:21:21,669 --> 01:21:24,629
I will ask you all to clap in unison

1483
01:21:24,672 --> 01:21:28,133
while my fee is being rehidden

1484
01:21:28,175 --> 01:21:30,969
here in the auditorium.

1485
01:21:31,012 --> 01:21:34,222
And I am ready.

1486
01:21:51,616 --> 01:21:53,199
They're done.

1487
01:21:53,242 --> 01:21:54,826
Thank you.

1488
01:21:56,412 --> 01:21:58,747
Ladies and gentlemen,
members of the public,

1489
01:21:58,789 --> 01:22:02,417
I may have to inconvenience you
one more time.

1490
01:22:02,460 --> 01:22:06,338
I must have, please,
for this effect, complete silence.

1491
01:23:11,696 --> 01:23:14,155
I couldn't watch because I knew

1492
01:23:14,198 --> 01:23:17,242
Buck wasn't going
to find the money.

1493
01:23:21,664 --> 01:23:24,374
I could only guess

1494
01:23:24,417 --> 01:23:26,918
that whatever Buck
had used in the past,

1495
01:23:26,961 --> 01:23:31,589
whether it was an earpiece
or his own powers,

1496
01:23:31,632 --> 01:23:33,633
it was gone now.

1497
01:23:35,386 --> 01:23:37,929
And for the first time, I realized

1498
01:23:37,972 --> 01:23:41,224
I wanted to believe
that Buck would always be out there,

1499
01:23:41,267 --> 01:23:43,935
in some small town somewhere,

1500
01:23:43,978 --> 01:23:47,188
showing people that
the impossible was possible,

1501
01:23:47,231 --> 01:23:50,108
that there was magic in this world.

1502
01:23:50,151 --> 01:23:52,777
But that wasn't meant to be.

1503
01:23:52,820 --> 01:23:57,282
This time it was
really over for Buck.

1504
01:24:05,166 --> 01:24:09,169
- Sir, you have the money.
- I'm sorry. I don't have it.

1505
01:24:09,211 --> 01:24:13,423
Sir, you have the money
in your left pocket.

1506
01:24:48,751 --> 01:24:51,836
I love this town!
