1
00:00:53,222 --> 00:00:55,307
For two? Right this way.

2
00:00:55,474 --> 00:00:58,185
- Is this okay?
- This is great. Thank you.

3
00:00:58,352 --> 00:01:00,729
Your menus.

4
00:01:10,155 --> 00:01:12,074
Thank you so much.

5
00:01:12,241 --> 00:01:14,451
You must get asked
to do this all the time.

6
00:01:14,618 --> 00:01:16,411
You know.
You've been there.

7
00:01:16,578 --> 00:01:18,330
Yeah, it's my pleasure.

8
00:01:18,497 --> 00:01:20,832
Well, I really appreciate it.

9
00:01:20,999 --> 00:01:23,293
So...

10
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:25,045
what do you think?

11
00:01:25,212 --> 00:01:28,298
Look, I wouldn't be helping you

12
00:01:28,465 --> 00:01:29,841
if I didn't tell you the truth.

13
00:01:30,008 --> 00:01:33,470
To get an agent here, you're gonna
need to get a new portfolio.

14
00:01:33,637 --> 00:01:36,765
Your photos feel very...

15
00:01:36,932 --> 00:01:38,684
Midwestern.

16
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:40,852
Yeah, of course.

17
00:01:41,019 --> 00:01:44,189
Can you recommend
a good photographer?

18
00:01:44,356 --> 00:01:46,149
Well, yeah, sure,

19
00:01:46,316 --> 00:01:48,527
but they don't come cheap.

20
00:01:48,694 --> 00:01:51,989
You're looking at a couple of grand
for one session.

21
00:01:53,865 --> 00:01:55,867
Okay.

22
00:01:56,034 --> 00:01:58,370
Listen, you have a look.

23
00:01:58,537 --> 00:02:00,163
You have poise.

24
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:03,667
I noticed you the first day
that you started working here.

25
00:02:03,834 --> 00:02:05,836
You just need to get that on film

26
00:02:06,003 --> 00:02:09,715
with a little more style
than what's in here.

27
00:02:09,881 --> 00:02:12,259
I get it.

28
00:02:13,635 --> 00:02:15,554
Katie.

29
00:02:15,721 --> 00:02:18,390
Look, I need to get back to work.

30
00:02:21,268 --> 00:02:23,020
Keep me posted, yeah?

31
00:02:23,186 --> 00:02:25,147
Definitely.

32
00:02:27,566 --> 00:02:30,402
- Have a good evening.
- Yeah, see you, Katie.

33
00:02:30,569 --> 00:02:32,889
- See you tomorrow, guys.
- Thanks a lot. See you tomorrow.

34
00:03:25,165 --> 00:03:27,751
Eh. Where'd you go, you little shit.

35
00:03:27,918 --> 00:03:30,045
Come on.
Show yourself.

36
00:03:30,212 --> 00:03:31,630
Come on!

37
00:03:31,797 --> 00:03:33,799
Show yourself!

38
00:03:37,594 --> 00:03:39,513
Fuck!

39
00:03:39,679 --> 00:03:41,515
Jesus!

40
00:03:41,681 --> 00:03:44,309
Fuck!

41
00:03:44,476 --> 00:03:46,186
Damn!

42
00:03:46,353 --> 00:03:48,105
Ah!

43
00:03:48,271 --> 00:03:50,649
- Hey, Jayson.
- Oh, hey.

44
00:03:50,816 --> 00:03:52,484
How's it going?

45
00:03:52,651 --> 00:03:55,112
I think he's long gone.

46
00:03:55,278 --> 00:03:58,115
What?
How'd you know?

47
00:03:58,281 --> 00:04:00,575
He nearly knocked me over
on the way in.

48
00:04:00,742 --> 00:04:03,120
Probably hailed a cab
uptown by now.

49
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:07,082
You know,
some years are worse than others.

50
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,044
It's rats.
It's New York.

51
00:04:11,211 --> 00:04:13,630
Sort of is what it is.

52
00:04:13,797 --> 00:04:15,006
What are you doing?

53
00:04:16,341 --> 00:04:18,760
Setting a trap that will work.

54
00:04:29,187 --> 00:04:31,231
Huh.

55
00:04:31,398 --> 00:04:33,275
Okay, a little hobby of yours?

56
00:04:33,442 --> 00:04:35,527
I know how to catch me some vermin.

57
00:04:35,694 --> 00:04:36,903
Vermin?

58
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:40,282
Yup. Learned a lot
down on the farms of Missouri.

59
00:04:40,449 --> 00:04:42,534
- Are you aiming for my job, Katie?
- You betcha.

60
00:04:42,701 --> 00:04:45,162
Well, I'm not gonna mess with you.

61
00:04:45,328 --> 00:04:46,705
Hope not.

62
00:04:46,872 --> 00:04:48,874
I got it.
I'll clean up the rest.

63
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,209
Let me know how it works out.

64
00:04:51,376 --> 00:04:54,713
You know, if it works, you're gonna
have to teach me how to do it.

65
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,717
It'll work
and I accept cash, jewelry...

66
00:04:58,884 --> 00:05:01,052
- How 'bout beer?
- Deal.

67
00:05:01,219 --> 00:05:03,054
I still need to fix that dimmer.

68
00:05:03,221 --> 00:05:05,640
Already took care of it.

69
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:08,119
Hello.
You are calling for photo shoot, yes?

70
00:06:08,286 --> 00:06:10,956
Yeah, I was just, um...

71
00:06:11,122 --> 00:06:12,791
You are model?

72
00:06:12,958 --> 00:06:14,292
Hello?

73
00:06:14,459 --> 00:06:16,002
Um, yeah.

74
00:06:16,169 --> 00:06:18,505
Great.
Text picture to us now, please.

75
00:06:18,672 --> 00:06:20,632
Excuse me?

76
00:06:20,799 --> 00:06:22,717
You want free photos,

77
00:06:22,884 --> 00:06:24,970
we need certain look
for our portfolio.

78
00:06:25,136 --> 00:06:27,639
You know, for promotion.
This is how it works.

79
00:06:27,806 --> 00:06:30,350
Oh. Who am I talking to?

80
00:06:30,517 --> 00:06:32,102
I'm Ivan.

81
00:06:32,269 --> 00:06:34,437
Your name is Katie,
I see here on my phone.

82
00:06:34,604 --> 00:06:36,982
Yes, that's right. Katie.

83
00:06:37,148 --> 00:06:39,985
Nice to meet you, Katie.
Now, please, text picture.

84
00:06:40,151 --> 00:06:41,903
Thank you.

85
00:06:44,072 --> 00:06:45,949
Okay.

86
00:07:19,691 --> 00:07:22,402
Yeah, here it is.
Just drop me by the door.

87
00:07:50,096 --> 00:07:52,098
Hello?

88
00:08:07,822 --> 00:08:09,908
Great.
That's beautiful.

89
00:08:10,075 --> 00:08:11,618
And smile.

90
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:15,664
Okay.
Turn around.

91
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:16,956
Can I help you?

92
00:08:17,123 --> 00:08:18,500
Katie.

93
00:08:18,667 --> 00:08:21,252
I have an appointment at 10 a.m.

94
00:08:22,754 --> 00:08:25,006
Miss Katie, of course.

95
00:08:25,173 --> 00:08:27,300
Ivan.

96
00:08:27,467 --> 00:08:29,761
- Ivan.
- What?

97
00:08:29,928 --> 00:08:31,429
Miss Katie's here.

98
00:08:31,596 --> 00:08:33,890
My next appointment's here.
We're done.

99
00:08:34,057 --> 00:08:37,018
Katie.

100
00:08:37,185 --> 00:08:39,229
- Yeah.
- We spoke on the phone.

101
00:08:39,396 --> 00:08:41,898
- You are much prettier than picture.
- Thank you.

102
00:08:42,065 --> 00:08:44,234
Guess that's why I'm here.

103
00:08:44,401 --> 00:08:46,236
Yes.

104
00:08:46,403 --> 00:08:48,363
You brought some clothes?

105
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:50,615
Yeah. Uh...

106
00:08:54,244 --> 00:08:56,121
Okay.

107
00:08:56,287 --> 00:08:57,288
Nah.

108
00:08:57,455 --> 00:09:00,041
No. No.

109
00:09:00,208 --> 00:09:03,628
Ah. This one.

110
00:09:03,795 --> 00:09:07,632
Georgy. Georgy.

111
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:11,052
Yeah. It's cool.

112
00:09:11,219 --> 00:09:13,680
Great.
Where do I get changed?

113
00:09:13,847 --> 00:09:15,348
Right here.

114
00:09:15,515 --> 00:09:17,475
We are all professionals, no?

115
00:09:20,395 --> 00:09:23,815
I'm joking. In the back.
Georgy will show you.

116
00:09:23,982 --> 00:09:26,109
Where is other girl?

117
00:09:26,276 --> 00:09:29,028
Nicky, go back to sleep.
Do not hurt yourself.

118
00:09:29,195 --> 00:09:31,448
And, please, um...

119
00:09:31,614 --> 00:09:34,534
- do not forget photo release form.
- Sure.

120
00:09:34,701 --> 00:09:36,161
- This way.
- Go.

121
00:09:36,327 --> 00:09:38,747
Okay.

122
00:09:38,913 --> 00:09:40,790
- Nicky.
- What, man?

123
00:09:40,957 --> 00:09:42,834
Off the box.

124
00:09:52,761 --> 00:09:54,763
Hey, will you help me with this?

125
00:09:54,929 --> 00:09:56,765
Of course.

126
00:10:04,022 --> 00:10:05,690
Thanks.

127
00:10:05,857 --> 00:10:07,192
How do I look?

128
00:10:07,358 --> 00:10:08,902
Like dream.

129
00:10:09,068 --> 00:10:11,196
Let's hope the pictures
say the same.

130
00:10:18,787 --> 00:10:21,206
Um... look at me.
Good.

131
00:10:21,372 --> 00:10:22,665
Tilt down a bit.

132
00:10:27,962 --> 00:10:30,423
Yes, yes.

133
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:31,841
To me, to me.

134
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:37,388
Now down the lens.

135
00:10:37,555 --> 00:10:39,724
On the model, Georgy.

136
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,856
Hmm.

137
00:10:52,153 --> 00:10:53,780
Ls everything okay?

138
00:10:53,947 --> 00:10:55,949
Yeah, it's perfection, yeah.

139
00:10:57,617 --> 00:10:58,868
Maybe something different, huh?

140
00:11:01,246 --> 00:11:03,414
The long lens, please.

141
00:11:04,749 --> 00:11:06,960
Do you want me to try
a different dress?

142
00:11:07,126 --> 00:11:08,962
Maybe. Maybe, um...

143
00:11:09,128 --> 00:11:12,131
maybe try more...

144
00:11:12,298 --> 00:11:14,008
skin.

145
00:11:14,175 --> 00:11:17,136
You know,
something sexy and sensual.

146
00:11:17,303 --> 00:11:20,431
Something a little more lower cut.

147
00:11:20,598 --> 00:11:22,851
Yeah, maybe, but, please,

148
00:11:23,017 --> 00:11:25,937
maybe try take this one down a bit.

149
00:11:26,104 --> 00:11:29,858
This one doesn't come down.
It's either on or off.

150
00:11:30,024 --> 00:11:32,277
Oh.

151
00:11:32,443 --> 00:11:34,195
Maybe off, then?

152
00:11:34,362 --> 00:11:35,363
You know...

153
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:37,407
No.

154
00:11:37,574 --> 00:11:39,284
I don't know.

155
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:42,453
No? It's nothing. Listen.

156
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:45,790
A lot of girls
to get different jobs, they...

157
00:11:45,957 --> 00:11:48,918
they show a little more.

158
00:11:49,085 --> 00:11:51,296
Especially in Europe.
It's normal.

159
00:11:51,462 --> 00:11:53,423
I'm sorry.

160
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:56,718
I didn't...
that's not what I was expecting.

161
00:11:56,885 --> 00:11:58,469
Oh, she wasn't expecting.

162
00:11:58,636 --> 00:12:01,806
And what is it you were expecting?

163
00:12:01,973 --> 00:12:04,601
You are a model.
You are professional.

164
00:12:04,767 --> 00:12:06,561
I'm not gonna take my clothes off

165
00:12:06,728 --> 00:12:08,605
so you can sell the photos
on the Internet.

166
00:12:08,771 --> 00:12:11,774
If that's what you guys want,
we have a real misunderstanding.

167
00:12:11,941 --> 00:12:13,484
She's fucking prude.

168
00:12:13,651 --> 00:12:15,236
Shut up, Nicky.

169
00:12:15,403 --> 00:12:18,072
But, um...

170
00:12:18,239 --> 00:12:21,826
you want free photos, yes?

171
00:12:21,993 --> 00:12:23,828
Not that bad.
Sorry.

172
00:12:23,995 --> 00:12:25,997
I'm outta here.

173
00:12:27,999 --> 00:12:30,043
Waste of time.

174
00:12:36,549 --> 00:12:39,344
Listen to me for a second.

175
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:40,762
I don't wanna listen to you!

176
00:12:40,929 --> 00:12:43,264
I'm tired of listening
to you every day!

177
00:12:43,431 --> 00:12:46,976
I rolled out of this house
at 4:30 in the morning.

178
00:12:47,143 --> 00:12:48,978
You were still lying
right here asleep.

179
00:12:49,145 --> 00:12:51,940
Oh, let me get
a thousand violins to play for you.

180
00:12:52,106 --> 00:12:54,692
I didn't do anything all day long,
what's wrong with you...

181
00:12:58,321 --> 00:12:59,864
Look at this place,

182
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:01,783
it's a fucking disaster!

183
00:13:04,869 --> 00:13:07,330
Don't you start with me!
Don't you start with me!

184
00:13:07,497 --> 00:13:10,833
I work all fucking day,
I gotta put up with all this stuff!

185
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,127
When I come home,
I want a fucking hot meal.

186
00:13:13,294 --> 00:13:14,796
Is that so difficult
for you to understand?

187
00:13:14,963 --> 00:13:16,547
What's wrong with you?!

188
00:13:16,714 --> 00:13:18,007
You are what is wrong with me!

189
00:13:18,174 --> 00:13:20,510
No wonder we live
in a fucking pigsty!

190
00:13:44,826 --> 00:13:46,995
Who is it?

191
00:13:51,624 --> 00:13:53,251
Hello, Miss Katie.

192
00:13:53,418 --> 00:13:55,628
What are you doing here?

193
00:13:55,795 --> 00:13:57,630
I come bring your pictures.

194
00:13:57,797 --> 00:14:01,050
I don't want those.
I told you that.

195
00:14:01,217 --> 00:14:04,262
I know...
because you were very upset.

196
00:14:04,429 --> 00:14:07,432
But I do this favor for you.

197
00:14:07,598 --> 00:14:09,308
I'm not bad guy.

198
00:14:09,475 --> 00:14:11,811
And I'm not upset.
Now, please.

199
00:14:11,978 --> 00:14:14,272
The pictures are great.

200
00:14:14,439 --> 00:14:16,441
You can use them.

201
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,360
Okay, okay.
I got them.

202
00:14:19,527 --> 00:14:21,738
Really, I appreciate it, I do.

203
00:14:21,904 --> 00:14:23,948
Now, I have work to do.

204
00:14:25,742 --> 00:14:27,660
What is with attitude?

205
00:14:27,827 --> 00:14:29,454
Look,

206
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:32,832
I know you're trying to do something
nice... make up for your brother,

207
00:14:32,999 --> 00:14:36,294
- but I assure you, it's okay.
- Okay, then.

208
00:14:36,461 --> 00:14:40,298
And I wiped all the pictures
off the drives for your privacy.

209
00:14:40,465 --> 00:14:42,383
Thank you.
That was really nice.

210
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:44,469
I appreciate it.

211
00:14:44,635 --> 00:14:46,304
Thanks, Georgy.

212
00:14:46,471 --> 00:14:48,389
I hope this helps.

213
00:14:48,556 --> 00:14:50,850
- Have a nice day.
- Okay, bye.

214
00:14:51,017 --> 00:14:52,393
Miss Katie.

215
00:17:23,878 --> 00:17:25,796
What are you doing?!

216
00:17:25,963 --> 00:17:27,506
You're so nice.

217
00:17:27,673 --> 00:17:29,634
So beautiful.
Come, sit down.

218
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:30,885
We'll talk.

219
00:17:31,052 --> 00:17:34,472
In three seconds,
I'm gonna scream so loud.

220
00:17:34,639 --> 00:17:37,350
Why are you doing this
after all I did for you?

221
00:17:37,516 --> 00:17:39,435
Leave now.

222
00:17:39,602 --> 00:17:41,479
Please, come, sit down.

223
00:17:41,646 --> 00:17:42,688
We'll talk.

224
00:17:55,743 --> 00:17:57,328
Help!

225
00:18:17,139 --> 00:18:18,933
Ah!

226
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:38,202
Shut up.
Shut up.

227
00:18:38,369 --> 00:18:39,745
Shut up.

228
00:19:08,607 --> 00:19:10,234
Don't move.

229
00:19:14,905 --> 00:19:17,283
Stop moving.

230
00:19:19,035 --> 00:19:21,078
Stop moving.

231
00:19:24,248 --> 00:19:26,792
Stop moving!
Stop moving.

232
00:19:31,005 --> 00:19:32,631
Shut up and don't move.

233
00:19:34,925 --> 00:19:38,429
Stop moving.
Stop moving.

234
00:19:48,814 --> 00:19:51,192
Katie? Katie?!

235
00:19:51,359 --> 00:19:53,319
Are you okay?
I'm coming in.

236
00:19:53,486 --> 00:19:54,862
I'm coming in!

237
00:19:55,029 --> 00:19:57,281
Katie?

238
00:19:59,617 --> 00:20:01,327
Oh, my God, Katie.

239
00:20:40,157 --> 00:20:41,992
Tell me that you like me.

240
00:20:44,995 --> 00:20:46,664
Tell me that you like me.

241
00:20:46,831 --> 00:20:49,458
Say I like you, Georgy.

242
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:51,919
Hmm?

243
00:20:56,048 --> 00:20:57,675
I like you, Georgy.

244
00:20:57,842 --> 00:21:00,177
Say that you like me.

245
00:21:02,096 --> 00:21:05,141
I like you, Georgy.
I like you, Georgy.

246
00:21:05,307 --> 00:21:07,893
I like you, Georgy.

247
00:21:22,741 --> 00:21:25,244
That's not necessary.

248
00:21:25,411 --> 00:21:26,579
You will like this.

249
00:21:30,833 --> 00:21:33,085
I'm sure...
I'm sure you'll like this.

250
00:21:33,252 --> 00:21:37,047
Be cool... be cool.
You will like this.

251
00:21:56,233 --> 00:21:58,402
I knew you'd like it.

252
00:22:00,196 --> 00:22:02,156
Tell me that you like me.

253
00:22:11,749 --> 00:22:13,292
You like it, I know.

254
00:22:13,459 --> 00:22:15,586
I know that you like it.
You like it!

255
00:22:15,753 --> 00:22:17,796
Say that you like it.

256
00:22:17,963 --> 00:22:20,758
Say it. Say it.

257
00:22:20,925 --> 00:22:22,927
Yeah, you like it.

258
00:23:40,838 --> 00:23:43,465
Bro, I fucked up again.

259
00:23:45,259 --> 00:23:46,927
Yeah.

260
00:23:47,094 --> 00:23:48,554
I fucked up.

261
00:24:29,845 --> 00:24:31,555
Yeah.

262
00:24:31,722 --> 00:24:33,557
On the sixth, yeah.

263
00:24:50,949 --> 00:24:52,242
Whoa.

264
00:24:54,411 --> 00:24:56,288
Holy shit, bro.

265
00:24:58,415 --> 00:25:01,085
She hit me with the Taser gun.

266
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:31,699
Put these on.

267
00:25:31,865 --> 00:25:34,451
Here. Take.

268
00:25:48,298 --> 00:25:49,967
- Nice job.
- He just came in.

269
00:25:50,134 --> 00:25:53,137
- He was not supposed to be here.
- And you were?

270
00:26:03,897 --> 00:26:05,649
You know what this means, right?

271
00:26:05,816 --> 00:26:09,027
Do you know what this means?

272
00:26:10,404 --> 00:26:12,322
I know.
I'm sorry.

273
00:26:12,489 --> 00:26:15,743
- Shh.
- We can clean this place up.

274
00:26:15,909 --> 00:26:17,786
It goes away. It goes away.

275
00:26:17,953 --> 00:26:20,497
We have calls from her to the studio.

276
00:26:20,664 --> 00:26:23,584
We have dead lover boy
on the floor here.

277
00:26:23,751 --> 00:26:25,586
You have your prints
all over this place.

278
00:26:25,753 --> 00:26:29,173
Do you have your junk inside her?

279
00:26:31,884 --> 00:26:35,554
- Yeah.
- There is no cleaning this up.

280
00:26:43,896 --> 00:26:46,815
Do you have your ketamine?

281
00:26:46,982 --> 00:26:48,859
Yes.

282
00:26:52,529 --> 00:26:54,364
Good.

283
00:26:55,866 --> 00:26:57,367
Give it to me.

284
00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:02,706
Now give me the knife.

285
00:27:02,873 --> 00:27:04,833
The knife. Knife!

286
00:27:10,714 --> 00:27:13,383
Hey! Hands.

287
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:16,720
Touch it. Touch it.

288
00:27:18,388 --> 00:27:20,557
Touch it.

289
00:27:24,645 --> 00:27:26,188
Good girl.

290
00:27:31,068 --> 00:27:33,570
Get paper towel and cleaner

291
00:27:33,737 --> 00:27:37,032
and wipe down
everything you have touched.

292
00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:42,454
You know,
you are one sick fuck.

293
00:27:42,621 --> 00:27:46,083
You know that?
You are one sick fuck.

294
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:49,628
And you're so perfect?

295
00:27:49,795 --> 00:27:52,965
We are never cleaning up after me,
though, are we?

296
00:27:55,592 --> 00:27:58,095
Father is going to love this one.

297
00:27:58,262 --> 00:28:00,097
Please, don't tell him.

298
00:28:00,264 --> 00:28:03,642
Please, bro.
Father doesn't need to know.

299
00:28:11,775 --> 00:28:13,694
Please...

300
00:28:15,988 --> 00:28:17,406
forgive my brother.

301
00:28:17,573 --> 00:28:20,117
He cannot help himself.

302
00:28:20,284 --> 00:28:24,538
But we all have our vices, eh?

303
00:28:32,713 --> 00:28:35,132
Open.
Open.

304
00:28:35,299 --> 00:28:37,551
Come here, come here.
Open. Open!

305
00:28:41,138 --> 00:28:43,265
Open.

306
00:28:48,312 --> 00:28:50,188
Yes.

307
00:28:58,030 --> 00:28:59,698
Shut up.
Swallow it.

308
00:29:03,827 --> 00:29:06,038
Good night, Katie.

309
00:29:10,125 --> 00:29:12,169
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

310
00:29:12,336 --> 00:29:14,671
Shh.

311
00:29:23,639 --> 00:29:26,016
Now, Nicky, go get the box.

312
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:35,919
Stop. Stop!

313
00:30:38,171 --> 00:30:41,425
Stop!

314
00:30:47,764 --> 00:30:49,975
Come on, come on!
You junkie!

315
00:30:50,142 --> 00:30:51,309
What the fuck, man?!

316
00:30:53,854 --> 00:30:57,190
She doesn't even know
what's happening. She's wasted.

317
00:31:11,663 --> 00:31:14,541
All right.
You still in the K-hole, darling?

318
00:31:18,628 --> 00:31:20,464
Do you know your name?

319
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:22,382
It's just a dream, see.

320
00:31:22,549 --> 00:31:24,801
One bad fucking dream.

321
00:31:32,809 --> 00:31:34,644
Water.

322
00:31:36,313 --> 00:31:38,023
She speaks, man.

323
00:31:39,483 --> 00:31:41,818
I'm thirsty, please.

324
00:31:44,654 --> 00:31:46,239
- I'm thirsty.
- You're thirsty?

325
00:31:46,406 --> 00:31:47,657
Yeah.

326
00:31:52,913 --> 00:31:55,916
Drink up, baby.
It's refreshing, isn't it?

327
00:31:58,543 --> 00:31:59,711
Hey, bro!

328
00:32:04,674 --> 00:32:06,843
Stop it!
The both of you.

329
00:32:08,845 --> 00:32:10,597
He was pissing on her!

330
00:32:10,764 --> 00:32:12,724
Is that so?

331
00:32:12,891 --> 00:32:15,685
What's the difference?
She's a piece of trash.

332
00:32:18,105 --> 00:32:20,023
Upstairs!

333
00:32:21,650 --> 00:32:23,151
Now!

334
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,954
You might want
to get some sleep, yeah?

335
00:32:39,876 --> 00:32:41,878
You're going to need it.

336
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:09,447
Help! Help!

337
00:33:12,075 --> 00:33:13,577
Help!

338
00:33:13,743 --> 00:33:16,121
Somebody help me!

339
00:33:17,747 --> 00:33:19,708
Help!

340
00:33:19,875 --> 00:33:23,086
Somebody help me!

341
00:33:27,174 --> 00:33:29,217
Somebody...

342
00:33:49,738 --> 00:33:51,406
Wash yourself.

343
00:33:54,534 --> 00:33:56,203
Unless you want me to.

344
00:33:56,369 --> 00:33:58,955
What do you want from me?!

345
00:33:59,122 --> 00:34:00,707
I want you to wash yourself.

346
00:34:00,874 --> 00:34:03,293
Fuck you!

347
00:34:06,546 --> 00:34:07,839
Let me do this, bro.

348
00:34:14,137 --> 00:34:15,722
You're gonna give her more shit.

349
00:34:15,889 --> 00:34:18,975
I cannot have her kicking
and screaming all over the place

350
00:34:19,142 --> 00:34:20,810
when Valko gets here.

351
00:34:20,977 --> 00:34:23,104
Just hold her down for me.

352
00:34:24,648 --> 00:34:27,067
No. No.

353
00:34:27,234 --> 00:34:28,818
Please.

354
00:34:28,985 --> 00:34:32,530
- No, no.
- Will make you very happy.

355
00:34:33,698 --> 00:34:36,451
Open your mouth.

356
00:34:36,618 --> 00:34:38,328
Open your mouth.

357
00:34:38,495 --> 00:34:39,871
Open your mouth.

358
00:34:43,166 --> 00:34:44,918
Now swallow like a good girl, all right?

359
00:34:45,085 --> 00:34:46,920
You know how to swallow, don't ya?

360
00:34:49,422 --> 00:34:51,675
Open.

361
00:34:55,303 --> 00:34:56,513
Good girl.

362
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:58,473
She's be very happy
in 15 minutes.

363
00:35:12,737 --> 00:35:14,864
- Shh.
- Get away!

364
00:35:15,031 --> 00:35:17,033
Be cool.

365
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,953
Be cool, be cool.

366
00:35:35,385 --> 00:35:37,387
It's better, huh?

367
00:35:38,888 --> 00:35:42,559
So I'll go get some clothes.

368
00:35:45,395 --> 00:35:47,272
I'll make you real pretty.

369
00:36:47,874 --> 00:36:49,542
Hey.

370
00:36:51,628 --> 00:36:54,214
I told you I will make you pretty.

371
00:36:54,381 --> 00:36:56,174
Yeah.

372
00:36:56,341 --> 00:36:58,301
So...

373
00:37:02,138 --> 00:37:04,057
Yeah.

374
00:37:09,062 --> 00:37:11,314
You're tired.

375
00:37:11,481 --> 00:37:13,483
Yeah.

376
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:27,205
Yeah.

377
00:37:29,082 --> 00:37:31,084
Yeah.

378
00:37:34,712 --> 00:37:37,507
Now it's shoes time.

379
00:38:28,725 --> 00:38:30,477
Stop! Stop! Stop!

380
00:38:30,643 --> 00:38:32,896
Stop! Stop!
Stop!

381
00:38:33,062 --> 00:38:34,481
Stop! Stop! Stop!

382
00:38:34,647 --> 00:38:35,648
Stop!

383
00:38:35,815 --> 00:38:38,610
Stop!

384
00:38:38,776 --> 00:38:40,904
Stop!

385
00:38:46,743 --> 00:38:49,245
Please, help me!
Please, help me!

386
00:38:49,412 --> 00:38:50,914
- Please! Help me!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

387
00:38:53,833 --> 00:38:55,335
Please! Help me!

388
00:38:55,502 --> 00:38:58,922
Please!

389
00:38:59,088 --> 00:39:00,465
I don't understand!

390
00:39:00,632 --> 00:39:03,051
Help me.

391
00:39:04,177 --> 00:39:07,388
Where am I? Where am I?

392
00:39:22,862 --> 00:39:24,697
Where am I? Where am I?

393
00:39:24,864 --> 00:39:26,616
I've been attacked.

394
00:39:26,783 --> 00:39:29,285
I've been raped!
I've been raped!

395
00:39:29,452 --> 00:39:30,662
I've been attacked!

396
00:39:30,828 --> 00:39:32,372
Please, help me!

397
00:39:32,539 --> 00:39:35,458
I've been attacked!
Speak English!

398
00:39:35,625 --> 00:39:37,669
Are you okay?
Come with me.

399
00:39:37,835 --> 00:39:40,004
- Everything will be fine.
- Please, help me.

400
00:39:40,171 --> 00:39:43,299
- Come with me.
- I've been attacked. I've been raped.

401
00:39:43,466 --> 00:39:45,843
- Everything will be fine.
- Please...

402
00:39:46,010 --> 00:39:48,888
I've been kidnapped.
I've been attacked.

403
00:39:49,055 --> 00:39:50,723
Watch your head.

404
00:39:50,890 --> 00:39:55,853
What's happening, what's happening,
what's happening?

405
00:39:57,188 --> 00:39:58,731
Are you American?

406
00:39:58,898 --> 00:40:01,693
Yes.
I've been raped.

407
00:40:01,859 --> 00:40:03,528
- Okay. Okay.
- I've been attacked.

408
00:40:03,695 --> 00:40:05,780
Where am I?

409
00:40:06,823 --> 00:40:08,866
You don't know where you are?

410
00:40:09,033 --> 00:40:10,952
No.

411
00:40:11,995 --> 00:40:13,496
You're in Bulgaria.

412
00:40:21,004 --> 00:40:23,756
No! No! No!

413
00:40:23,923 --> 00:40:25,049
Now you remember?

414
00:40:25,216 --> 00:40:26,843
No!

415
00:40:27,010 --> 00:40:28,928
I was in New York!

416
00:40:29,095 --> 00:40:32,849
I was raped in New York!

417
00:40:33,016 --> 00:40:35,351
I don't know how I got here!

418
00:40:35,518 --> 00:40:37,437
- Okay, okay.
- No!

419
00:40:37,604 --> 00:40:41,566
Everything will be fine.

420
00:40:41,733 --> 00:40:44,402
Georgy, you finished playing house
with your girlfriend?

421
00:40:44,569 --> 00:40:46,070
Fuck, man.

422
00:40:51,743 --> 00:40:55,705
Ivan! Ivan!

423
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:02,086
I say it again,
you need to see doctor.

424
00:41:02,253 --> 00:41:03,671
I'll take you to clinic.

425
00:41:03,838 --> 00:41:05,923
No one's going to touch me.

426
00:41:07,425 --> 00:41:09,302
I just wanna go home.

427
00:41:09,469 --> 00:41:12,055
Yeah, first, I finish report.

428
00:41:13,389 --> 00:41:15,892
So three men
broke into your apartment

429
00:41:16,059 --> 00:41:17,727
in New York.

430
00:41:17,894 --> 00:41:19,687
I've told you already.

431
00:41:19,854 --> 00:41:22,899
Forgive me,
this is a strange story.

432
00:41:23,066 --> 00:41:25,777
Story?

433
00:41:27,195 --> 00:41:29,656
These men, you knew them?

434
00:41:29,822 --> 00:41:31,824
No.

435
00:41:31,991 --> 00:41:35,078
I've told you already.
You should be looking for them.

436
00:41:37,246 --> 00:41:40,375
You're hurt,
but you won't see doctor.

437
00:41:40,541 --> 00:41:42,877
I think you take drugs.

438
00:41:43,044 --> 00:41:44,837
That's why you refuse doctor

439
00:41:45,004 --> 00:41:47,799
because drugs show up in test.

440
00:41:49,759 --> 00:41:52,679
I wanna go to
the American Embassy now.

441
00:41:52,845 --> 00:41:55,682
I'm not gonna answer
anymore of your questions

442
00:41:55,848 --> 00:41:58,142
unless you're gonna
charge me with something.

443
00:42:02,730 --> 00:42:03,898
Hello.

444
00:42:08,111 --> 00:42:10,780
Please, let's speak English.

445
00:42:10,947 --> 00:42:13,282
Okay.
This is Katie.

446
00:42:13,449 --> 00:42:16,411
Katie Carter.
She refuses to see doctor.

447
00:42:16,577 --> 00:42:20,331
Detective,
please, get me a coffee.

448
00:42:22,333 --> 00:42:23,459
Two coffees.

449
00:42:23,626 --> 00:42:26,671
Oh. Sure.

450
00:42:26,838 --> 00:42:28,798
I'll be back in a minute

451
00:42:28,965 --> 00:42:30,800
with two coffees.

452
00:42:42,061 --> 00:42:44,272
My dear, dear, girl.

453
00:42:47,066 --> 00:42:49,235
My name is Ana.

454
00:42:49,402 --> 00:42:51,821
You are Katie?

455
00:42:54,157 --> 00:42:56,117
I run a shelter.

456
00:42:56,284 --> 00:42:58,703
I help women
who have been hurt.

457
00:42:58,870 --> 00:43:01,873
I know what you
have been through,

458
00:43:02,039 --> 00:43:04,375
believe me.

459
00:43:07,503 --> 00:43:09,422
Will you take me to the...

460
00:43:11,674 --> 00:43:13,509
to the Embassy?

461
00:43:13,676 --> 00:43:15,803
Yes.
Of course.

462
00:43:17,138 --> 00:43:19,265
Are you hungry?

463
00:43:19,432 --> 00:43:21,851
I'm not hungry.

464
00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:26,355
I wanna go to the Embassy now.

465
00:43:26,522 --> 00:43:28,524
I understand.

466
00:43:28,691 --> 00:43:31,360
I have same experience.

467
00:43:35,698 --> 00:43:37,033
I know.

468
00:43:44,707 --> 00:43:46,959
We get you some clothes.

469
00:43:47,126 --> 00:43:49,086
Maybe you want shower.

470
00:43:49,253 --> 00:43:51,714
Then we go to Embassy.

471
00:43:51,881 --> 00:43:54,592
But first,
we get you out of here.

472
00:44:01,808 --> 00:44:03,768
Hello. My name is Ana Patov.

473
00:44:03,935 --> 00:44:06,229
I have a young woman.
She needs help.

474
00:44:06,395 --> 00:44:08,856
Yes, she's American.

475
00:44:09,023 --> 00:44:10,691
Her name is Katie Carter.

476
00:44:10,858 --> 00:44:12,985
May I bring her to you?

477
00:44:14,111 --> 00:44:15,696
Yes, okay.

478
00:44:15,863 --> 00:44:17,073
Okay.

479
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:18,825
Thank you.

480
00:44:21,077 --> 00:44:22,578
I must warn you,

481
00:44:22,745 --> 00:44:25,081
you don't just go on plane.

482
00:44:25,248 --> 00:44:27,083
They make report,

483
00:44:27,250 --> 00:44:29,377
ask questions,
make sure who you are.

484
00:44:29,544 --> 00:44:31,629
It takes time.

485
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:36,342
I can give you clothes and money.

486
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:39,595
Money is what you need most.

487
00:44:42,932 --> 00:44:44,767
My house is near Embassy.

488
00:44:44,934 --> 00:44:47,019
Very close.

489
00:44:47,186 --> 00:44:51,274
We can stop for clothes,
bandages.

490
00:44:52,859 --> 00:44:54,443
Just a few minutes.

491
00:44:54,610 --> 00:44:57,154
Yes, please.

492
00:44:58,155 --> 00:44:59,740
Good.

493
00:45:29,812 --> 00:45:32,481
Please.

494
00:45:33,566 --> 00:45:35,234
It's okay.

495
00:45:40,281 --> 00:45:41,741
Here.

496
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:44,827
Come.
This way.

497
00:45:49,874 --> 00:45:52,335
Come.
I keep extra clothes downstairs.

498
00:45:52,501 --> 00:45:53,878
Storage.

499
00:45:54,045 --> 00:45:56,130
Something will fit you.

500
00:45:59,634 --> 00:46:01,385
Please, down here.

501
00:46:17,860 --> 00:46:19,403
Welcome back.

502
00:46:22,406 --> 00:46:24,241
You tried to hurt my family.

503
00:46:27,578 --> 00:46:29,622
No! No!

504
00:46:34,418 --> 00:46:36,003
You almost got away, yes?

505
00:46:36,170 --> 00:46:37,505
Almost.

506
00:46:40,216 --> 00:46:43,594
No!

507
00:46:52,436 --> 00:46:54,397
No more running for you.

508
00:47:05,491 --> 00:47:06,784
You think this hurts?

509
00:47:06,951 --> 00:47:08,786
You just wait.

510
00:47:10,287 --> 00:47:12,248
Just wait.

511
00:48:02,339 --> 00:48:04,425
Please, don't hurt me.

512
00:48:04,592 --> 00:48:06,302
Hold still.

513
00:48:45,716 --> 00:48:47,551
You want to move, yes?

514
00:48:47,718 --> 00:48:50,554
Come, I make you...

515
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:04,902
Pain is good, yes?

516
00:49:05,069 --> 00:49:07,988
You like this, yes?

517
00:49:15,079 --> 00:49:18,082
Open or I shock your face.

518
00:49:41,522 --> 00:49:44,900
Pain wakes the body.

519
00:49:46,110 --> 00:49:50,114
Makes everything feel better.

520
00:49:51,782 --> 00:49:54,285
You understand my English?

521
00:50:05,713 --> 00:50:07,464
Now you move.

522
00:50:09,466 --> 00:50:11,969
Move or I shock you.

523
00:50:14,972 --> 00:50:16,765
No!

524
00:51:18,869 --> 00:51:20,871
I'm done.

525
00:51:38,847 --> 00:51:40,516
You all right, bro?

526
00:52:01,495 --> 00:52:03,247
Hey.

527
00:52:05,833 --> 00:52:07,126
Hey.

528
00:52:11,714 --> 00:52:12,756
Hey.

529
00:52:25,019 --> 00:52:26,645
Don't worry.

530
00:52:26,812 --> 00:52:29,773
I wouldn't fuck you
with Nicky's dick right now.

531
00:52:29,940 --> 00:52:31,984
You're disgusting.

532
00:52:32,151 --> 00:52:33,944
You should see yourself, Katie.

533
00:52:34,111 --> 00:52:35,738
You're not so pretty.

534
00:52:35,904 --> 00:52:37,489
You're not so proud.

535
00:52:46,123 --> 00:52:48,042
You want to touch me?

536
00:52:51,045 --> 00:52:53,130
Good. Good.

537
00:52:55,382 --> 00:52:57,676
I will touch you, too.

538
00:53:07,102 --> 00:53:09,229
It's deep enough.

539
00:53:09,396 --> 00:53:10,814
You could put a truck down here.

540
00:53:10,981 --> 00:53:13,067
Shut up.
Keep digging.

541
00:53:22,493 --> 00:53:24,912
I've hit rock.

542
00:53:25,079 --> 00:53:26,663
Solid rock.

543
00:53:26,830 --> 00:53:28,791
I can't dig anymore, man.

544
00:53:30,167 --> 00:53:32,169
It's deep enough.

545
00:53:32,336 --> 00:53:34,838
Let's get her in.

546
00:53:40,010 --> 00:53:41,637
Katie.

547
00:53:41,804 --> 00:53:45,099
The box is ready for you now.

548
00:53:45,265 --> 00:53:47,518
You remember it, yes?

549
00:54:08,038 --> 00:54:10,165
You're a sick fuck.

550
00:54:11,375 --> 00:54:14,753
No, Georgy is a sick fuck.

551
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:17,631
I'm not.
He's a crazy, sick fuck.

552
00:54:17,798 --> 00:54:21,218
Nicolai is just sick.

553
00:54:21,385 --> 00:54:23,595
Me?

554
00:54:23,762 --> 00:54:25,806
I'm just fuck.

555
00:54:29,643 --> 00:54:33,397
And you think that if you take
your clothes off for me...

556
00:54:34,648 --> 00:54:36,984
in New York...

557
00:54:37,151 --> 00:54:38,235
none of this would happen.

558
00:54:38,402 --> 00:54:40,904
Maybe, yes?

559
00:54:42,906 --> 00:54:44,074
Go.

560
00:54:55,085 --> 00:54:58,255
Here you go, bro.
A present.

561
00:54:58,422 --> 00:55:00,090
Let's go.

562
00:55:13,437 --> 00:55:14,480
There.

563
00:55:22,905 --> 00:55:24,781
Wait.

564
00:55:32,247 --> 00:55:34,458
Goodbye, Miss Katie.

565
00:55:38,295 --> 00:55:40,130
If you want,
we put you in the box, too.

566
00:55:40,297 --> 00:55:42,466
- You can be together.
- Fuck off.

567
00:55:43,634 --> 00:55:45,344
Hold on. Hold on.

568
00:56:06,615 --> 00:56:09,868
No, no, no, no, no, no.

569
00:56:10,035 --> 00:56:14,206
Please, God,
don't do this to me.

570
00:56:39,523 --> 00:56:41,191
Now, put it.

571
00:56:52,661 --> 00:56:54,413
Help me.

572
00:56:54,580 --> 00:56:56,206
Please.

573
00:56:56,373 --> 00:56:58,083
God, help me.

574
00:57:01,587 --> 00:57:05,757
Don't let me die, please.

575
00:57:07,259 --> 00:57:09,177
Not down here.

576
00:57:09,344 --> 00:57:11,054
Not like this.

577
00:57:12,306 --> 00:57:13,974
Not down here
and not like this.

578
00:57:14,141 --> 00:57:15,892
Not down here and
not like this.

579
00:57:16,059 --> 00:57:18,270
Not down here
and not like this.

580
00:57:18,437 --> 00:57:21,064
Not down here
and not like this!

581
00:57:55,766 --> 00:57:57,768
Mama.

582
00:58:22,626 --> 00:58:24,628
So maybe we go out tonight, huh?

583
00:58:24,795 --> 00:58:26,463
Celebrate.

584
00:58:27,631 --> 00:58:30,175
Come on, Ivan.

585
00:58:30,342 --> 00:58:32,636
It's finish. We have some fun
before we go back, huh?

586
00:58:32,803 --> 00:58:35,972
We're never going back.

587
00:58:36,139 --> 00:58:39,309
- What?
- We can't go back, ever.

588
00:58:39,476 --> 00:58:43,063
Is too risky.
Thank Georgy.

589
00:58:44,147 --> 00:58:47,234
Need to lie low.
Split up.

590
00:58:47,401 --> 00:58:50,445
Go stay one of your bitches, huh?

591
00:58:50,612 --> 00:58:53,782
Why?

592
00:58:53,949 --> 00:58:58,036
She talked to the police.
Ls all of your brain gone, Nicolai?

593
00:59:01,915 --> 00:59:04,710
Where is he, anyway?
Crying over girlfriend?

594
00:59:08,672 --> 00:59:10,882
I'll make him cry.

595
00:59:11,049 --> 00:59:13,927
Fucking asshole.

596
01:00:22,788 --> 01:00:24,456
Hello?

597
01:00:28,668 --> 01:00:31,171
Hello?

598
01:01:40,407 --> 01:01:42,617
Help!

599
01:01:42,784 --> 01:01:45,161
Can anyone hear me?

600
01:05:26,716 --> 01:05:27,884
Stay away from me.

601
01:05:28,051 --> 01:05:30,220
Oh, are you American?

602
01:05:30,386 --> 01:05:32,972
Don't come near me.

603
01:05:34,057 --> 01:05:35,391
You have no need to fear me.

604
01:05:35,558 --> 01:05:38,353
You're English is good.

605
01:05:38,520 --> 01:05:42,565
Oh, I study philosophy in London.
Your English is better.

606
01:05:49,531 --> 01:05:50,949
A young American girl

607
01:05:51,116 --> 01:05:54,410
scurrying around
underneath of here...

608
01:05:54,577 --> 01:05:56,079
why?

609
01:05:56,246 --> 01:05:57,789
This I would like to hear.

610
01:05:57,956 --> 01:05:59,749
Please, come and sit. Eat.

611
01:05:59,916 --> 01:06:01,709
No, thank you.

612
01:06:01,876 --> 01:06:03,545
Don't be foolish.

613
01:06:03,711 --> 01:06:05,421
I want to help you.

614
01:06:05,588 --> 01:06:07,632
I don't need help.

615
01:06:07,799 --> 01:06:10,176
Okay.

616
01:06:10,343 --> 01:06:12,428
Take the clothes,

617
01:06:12,595 --> 01:06:15,098
take the shoes, and the food.

618
01:06:15,265 --> 01:06:17,767
You do not need to steal.

619
01:08:49,085 --> 01:08:51,045
Little mouse.

620
01:08:55,258 --> 01:08:57,218
I'm pleased to find you here.

621
01:09:10,815 --> 01:09:12,692
No closer.

622
01:09:12,859 --> 01:09:15,987
Someone did very bad things to you,
I know.

623
01:09:19,032 --> 01:09:20,450
I can call the police.

624
01:09:20,616 --> 01:09:22,493
Don't.

625
01:09:28,708 --> 01:09:31,002
You can't run from this forever.

626
01:09:35,798 --> 01:09:37,800
I'm not running.

627
01:12:13,789 --> 01:12:15,708
Merci, merci.

628
01:13:05,633 --> 01:13:07,343
Hello?

629
01:13:09,804 --> 01:13:11,305
Katie?

630
01:13:12,557 --> 01:13:14,517
Katie?

631
01:13:17,353 --> 01:13:18,854
Katie?

632
01:13:37,290 --> 01:13:40,668
Father, tell me,
what could not wait?

633
01:13:40,835 --> 01:13:42,503
There is a woman.

634
01:13:42,670 --> 01:13:45,881
A vagrant.
I think she needs help.

635
01:13:46,048 --> 01:13:47,758
She's American.

636
01:13:47,925 --> 01:13:49,010
- American?
- Mm.

637
01:13:50,886 --> 01:13:54,098
I believe she has come into
the worst kind of abuse.

638
01:13:56,058 --> 01:13:58,394
- Like what?
- I don't even want to imagine.

639
01:13:58,561 --> 01:14:00,229
I gave her some food,
some clothes, and...

640
01:14:00,396 --> 01:14:02,398
What can I do?

641
01:14:02,565 --> 01:14:04,275
I'm worried.

642
01:14:04,442 --> 01:14:06,944
I'm afraid she's about
to do something terrible.

643
01:14:07,111 --> 01:14:10,364
- Terrible?
- Yes.

644
01:14:13,367 --> 01:14:15,536
This is the Bible I gave to her.

645
01:14:15,703 --> 01:14:17,663
She left it open.

646
01:14:19,165 --> 01:14:20,750
"Vengeance is mine;

647
01:14:20,916 --> 01:14:23,961
I will repay, saith the Lord."

648
01:14:24,128 --> 01:14:26,297
This American,
what does she look like?

649
01:14:26,464 --> 01:14:29,425
In her early 20s.

650
01:14:29,592 --> 01:14:31,761
About this high.

651
01:14:31,927 --> 01:14:34,889
She weighs about as much
as a leaf dripping wet.

652
01:14:36,974 --> 01:14:38,851
She has long brown hair and...

653
01:14:40,770 --> 01:14:42,229
she's beautiful.

654
01:14:42,396 --> 01:14:45,816
Father, what do you think
this woman is capable of?

655
01:14:45,983 --> 01:14:49,403
I've been asking myself
the same question.

656
01:15:05,461 --> 01:15:07,338
Please, Katie, release me.

657
01:15:07,505 --> 01:15:09,131
Please.

658
01:15:09,298 --> 01:15:11,634
It's okay.

659
01:15:11,801 --> 01:15:13,386
It's okay, Georgy.

660
01:15:13,552 --> 01:15:16,847
I'm going to take
good care of you.

661
01:15:20,142 --> 01:15:22,645
No. No.

662
01:15:22,812 --> 01:15:25,398
You like me now, yes?

663
01:15:25,564 --> 01:15:27,483
Yes.

664
01:15:28,859 --> 01:15:33,322
This feels good, yes?

665
01:15:35,324 --> 01:15:37,827
Shh.

666
01:15:44,667 --> 01:15:46,335
I could castrate you.

667
01:15:46,502 --> 01:15:48,587
No, no, please.

668
01:15:55,636 --> 01:16:00,015
Or I could slit your throat.

669
01:16:00,182 --> 01:16:02,643
But you are a sick

670
01:16:02,810 --> 01:16:05,521
and diseased bag of flesh

671
01:16:05,688 --> 01:16:08,482
and that is how you deserve to die.

672
01:16:08,649 --> 01:16:12,820
Rotting like you left me.

673
01:16:24,039 --> 01:16:26,876
If I were you,
I'd get some antibiotics.

674
01:16:27,042 --> 01:16:30,004
Wouldn't want infection to set in,
would we?

675
01:16:32,381 --> 01:16:34,341
Why are you doing this?

676
01:16:36,051 --> 01:16:38,721
Please, don't do this.

677
01:16:38,888 --> 01:16:40,473
Please, Katie.

678
01:16:40,639 --> 01:16:42,266
No, no.

679
01:16:42,433 --> 01:16:44,268
No, please.

680
01:16:48,939 --> 01:16:51,692
I'm making you look pretty.

681
01:16:54,487 --> 01:16:56,405
Real...

682
01:16:56,572 --> 01:16:58,491
pretty.

683
01:16:58,657 --> 01:17:01,494
No, please.

684
01:17:13,047 --> 01:17:16,634
Katie! Katie!

685
01:17:25,935 --> 01:17:27,770
American Embassy, please.

686
01:17:27,937 --> 01:17:30,356
Thank you.

687
01:19:22,134 --> 01:19:24,887
Still in the K-hole, darling?

688
01:19:25,054 --> 01:19:27,723
You don't even know
what's happening, do you?

689
01:19:27,890 --> 01:19:30,059
We killed you.

690
01:19:30,225 --> 01:19:32,353
Yeah.

691
01:19:32,519 --> 01:19:35,314
See, this is all a dream!

692
01:19:39,109 --> 01:19:42,237
One... bad...

693
01:19:42,404 --> 01:19:43,906
fucking...

694
01:19:44,073 --> 01:19:46,408
dream!

695
01:19:46,575 --> 01:19:48,577
Are you thirsty?

696
01:19:50,454 --> 01:19:52,915
Take a big drink.

697
01:19:55,417 --> 01:19:58,045
Second course.

698
01:19:58,212 --> 01:19:59,421
No, no!

699
01:19:59,588 --> 01:20:01,256
Put it in your mouth and swallow.

700
01:20:01,423 --> 01:20:04,343
You know how to swallow,
don't you, darling?!

701
01:20:04,510 --> 01:20:06,762
Don't you?!

702
01:21:28,010 --> 01:21:31,513
Fucking whore.
Katie, you fucking whore.

703
01:21:35,059 --> 01:21:36,560
Help!

704
01:21:36,727 --> 01:21:40,105
Help! Help!

705
01:21:40,272 --> 01:21:44,026
Help!
Help!

706
01:21:44,193 --> 01:21:47,196
No one can hear you down here.

707
01:21:47,362 --> 01:21:49,198
Scream all you want.

708
01:21:49,364 --> 01:21:51,158
It ain't gonna work.

709
01:21:51,325 --> 01:21:54,036
Trust me, I tried.

710
01:22:06,965 --> 01:22:08,884
You like me now, don't you?

711
01:22:09,051 --> 01:22:10,636
I'm sorry, Miss Katie.

712
01:22:10,803 --> 01:22:12,554
Answer me.

713
01:22:20,604 --> 01:22:22,940
Tell me you like me.

714
01:22:24,691 --> 01:22:26,693
Tell me! Tell me!

715
01:22:29,238 --> 01:22:31,865
- Tell me you like me.
- I like you.

716
01:22:33,742 --> 01:22:37,913
I like you. I like you.

717
01:22:38,080 --> 01:22:41,250
I like you, Katie.

718
01:22:46,421 --> 01:22:49,758
I like... I like you, Katie.
I like you, Katie.

719
01:22:49,925 --> 01:22:51,426
I like you...

720
01:23:02,604 --> 01:23:04,439
Suck on that.

721
01:24:27,731 --> 01:24:29,858
You.

722
01:24:44,706 --> 01:24:46,667
Please...

723
01:24:46,833 --> 01:24:48,669
don't do this.

724
01:25:02,849 --> 01:25:05,018
Now...

725
01:25:05,185 --> 01:25:08,855
you move or I shock you.

726
01:25:19,157 --> 01:25:21,326
You like electricity, don't you?

727
01:25:36,091 --> 01:25:37,926
What are you doing?

728
01:25:42,639 --> 01:25:44,683
Please...

729
01:25:44,850 --> 01:25:47,060
I beg of you.

730
01:25:48,937 --> 01:25:50,564
No more!

731
01:25:54,443 --> 01:25:56,320
No more?

732
01:25:56,486 --> 01:26:00,032
I haven't even gotten started.

733
01:26:01,825 --> 01:26:03,577
Open.

734
01:26:17,090 --> 01:26:18,592
A little foreplay.

735
01:26:20,844 --> 01:26:22,137
Right?

736
01:26:28,393 --> 01:26:31,480
Ls the pain
waking your body up yet?

737
01:27:24,533 --> 01:27:28,578
They used to use shock therapy
to help the mentally ill.

738
01:27:32,040 --> 01:27:34,709
Since you are so sick,

739
01:27:34,876 --> 01:27:36,628
you, Valko,

740
01:27:36,795 --> 01:27:39,464
need a great deal of therapy.

741
01:29:30,408 --> 01:29:31,743
No.

742
01:30:13,326 --> 01:30:15,370
Boo.

743
01:30:43,982 --> 01:30:46,192
My dear girl.

744
01:30:46,359 --> 01:30:48,528
Believe me,

745
01:30:48,695 --> 01:30:50,405
I know what you're going through.

746
01:31:03,418 --> 01:31:04,919
No!

747
01:31:05,086 --> 01:31:07,756
No! Oh, no!

748
01:31:07,922 --> 01:31:09,132
Please!

749
01:31:09,299 --> 01:31:10,967
No!

750
01:31:11,134 --> 01:31:13,011
Please!

751
01:31:13,178 --> 01:31:15,055
No!

752
01:31:16,765 --> 01:31:19,267
No!

753
01:31:19,434 --> 01:31:21,770
Please!

754
01:31:23,897 --> 01:31:26,608
Ana, I must talk to you.

755
01:31:26,775 --> 01:31:28,443
Ana.

756
01:31:35,158 --> 01:31:37,661
No. No.

757
01:31:43,124 --> 01:31:44,793
Ana?

758
01:31:50,048 --> 01:31:51,466
What the fuck?

759
01:31:53,593 --> 01:31:55,595
Ana?

760
01:31:58,932 --> 01:32:00,642
I must talk to her.

761
01:32:00,809 --> 01:32:02,560
The American.

762
01:32:02,727 --> 01:32:04,688
How do I find her?

763
01:32:04,854 --> 01:32:08,274
Do you know her?
Who is she?

764
01:32:08,441 --> 01:32:11,069
Katie. Her name is Katie.

765
01:32:11,236 --> 01:32:14,489
She came to me for help
not too long ago.

766
01:32:18,201 --> 01:32:19,953
And did you help her?

767
01:32:20,120 --> 01:32:21,913
I thought so.

768
01:32:22,080 --> 01:32:25,458
Now I'm not so sure.

769
01:32:49,524 --> 01:32:51,985
So she's down there.

770
01:32:52,152 --> 01:32:53,987
Help her.

771
01:32:58,283 --> 01:32:59,993
This time,
you must help her, Kiril.

772
01:33:00,160 --> 01:33:02,495
Ana?

773
01:33:09,753 --> 01:33:11,463
My God.

774
01:33:18,344 --> 01:33:20,513
Georgy. Georgy.

775
01:33:57,926 --> 01:34:00,053
Welcome to the party.

776
01:34:01,095 --> 01:34:03,389
You said it best, didn't you?

777
01:34:03,556 --> 01:34:06,059
What was it exactly?

778
01:34:06,226 --> 01:34:10,271
Oh, yeah.
"We all have our vices."

779
01:34:10,438 --> 01:34:13,024
Take a look at mine.

780
01:34:19,280 --> 01:34:21,407
Oh, fuck me!

781
01:34:21,574 --> 01:34:23,284
Oh!

782
01:34:44,430 --> 01:34:46,182
- Now...
- Let me out!

783
01:34:46,349 --> 01:34:48,059
Mother's calling.

784
01:34:49,936 --> 01:34:51,145
Get me out!

785
01:34:51,312 --> 01:34:53,731
Oh, shut up, Ana.

786
01:34:53,898 --> 01:34:55,650
- Please!
- Ana, shut up.

787
01:34:55,817 --> 01:34:58,403
Now, Ivan, you shouldn't talk
to your mother that way.

788
01:35:01,489 --> 01:35:03,324
What's so funny?

789
01:35:03,491 --> 01:35:05,618
She's not my mother.

790
01:35:07,328 --> 01:35:10,331
Father didn't stop raping her
until after Nicky was born.

791
01:35:12,792 --> 01:35:15,336
I told you she was a sick fuck.

792
01:35:32,812 --> 01:35:34,981
You're the sickest of them all.

793
01:35:36,566 --> 01:35:39,652
How many others did you sell
to animals like Valko?

794
01:35:41,362 --> 01:35:43,698
How many more like me?

795
01:35:45,617 --> 01:35:49,162
How many?!

796
01:35:59,088 --> 01:36:02,175
No. No.

797
01:36:02,342 --> 01:36:04,385
No.

798
01:36:14,228 --> 01:36:17,148
No, please!

799
01:36:19,192 --> 01:36:21,194
Baby!

800
01:36:21,361 --> 01:36:23,446
Georgy!

801
01:36:23,613 --> 01:36:26,366
No!

802
01:36:26,532 --> 01:36:28,743
Georgy!

803
01:36:50,932 --> 01:36:52,558
Killing you would be too easy.

804
01:36:52,725 --> 01:36:54,560
Georgy.

805
01:36:55,603 --> 01:36:59,565
I want you to have
the same experience as me!

806
01:37:28,720 --> 01:37:31,180
He's not a sick fuck anymore.

807
01:37:31,347 --> 01:37:35,435
You're fucking dead.
You're fucking dead.

808
01:37:35,601 --> 01:37:38,396
Yeah, that's what I thought.

809
01:37:39,772 --> 01:37:43,443
For the first few days,
I wished I was dead.

810
01:37:46,446 --> 01:37:49,032
Now...

811
01:37:49,198 --> 01:37:51,284
I don't know.

812
01:37:56,330 --> 01:37:57,999
No. No. No.

813
01:37:58,166 --> 01:38:00,960
No, no, no.

814
01:38:01,127 --> 01:38:03,296
No!

815
01:38:08,426 --> 01:38:10,136
You think that hurts?!

816
01:38:10,303 --> 01:38:13,014
You just wait!

817
01:38:19,145 --> 01:38:20,855
Is that too tight?

818
01:38:21,022 --> 01:38:22,315
Yes. Yes.

819
01:38:22,482 --> 01:38:23,983
Let me loosen it for you.

820
01:38:26,486 --> 01:38:27,904
Whoops.

821
01:38:28,071 --> 01:38:29,614
Wrong way.

822
01:38:29,781 --> 01:38:31,657
Fucking whore.

823
01:38:31,824 --> 01:38:33,993
You fucking whore.

824
01:38:34,160 --> 01:38:35,703
Want some more?

825
01:38:38,706 --> 01:38:42,335
You let me know
when it's tight enough.

826
01:38:49,258 --> 01:38:52,345
Guys like it tight, right?

827
01:38:56,057 --> 01:38:58,017
Please!

828
01:39:07,318 --> 01:39:09,445
You should see yourself.

829
01:39:10,863 --> 01:39:13,491
Not so proud now, Ivan.

830
01:39:15,701 --> 01:39:17,203
And to think...

831
01:39:17,370 --> 01:39:19,705
all of this could have been avoided

832
01:39:19,872 --> 01:39:22,166
if you weren't such...

833
01:39:22,333 --> 01:39:24,544
an asshole

834
01:39:24,710 --> 01:39:27,713
piece of shit!

835
01:39:37,557 --> 01:39:39,016
Katie.

836
01:39:39,183 --> 01:39:41,144
Don't move.

837
01:39:41,310 --> 01:39:42,603
Please.

838
01:39:49,569 --> 01:39:51,320
Hey! Let her go!

839
01:39:54,115 --> 01:39:55,575
I said let her go!

840
01:39:56,701 --> 01:39:58,411
Let her go!

841
01:39:58,578 --> 01:40:00,496
Stop it, God damn it!

842
01:40:46,792 --> 01:40:48,794
I'm sorry.
