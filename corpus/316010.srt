1
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:28,114
Since the very beginning

2
00:00:28,186 --> 00:00:31,849
my ancestors have known
of a giant creature.

3
00:00:31,923 --> 00:00:36,451
A man like beast
they call Taku He.

4
00:00:36,527 --> 00:00:42,295
Like us, Taku He hunted,
fished, and raised his young,

5
00:00:42,366 --> 00:00:44,994
taking only what he needed.

6
00:00:45,069 --> 00:00:49,472
But when the white man came
blasting the mountain for gold

7
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:52,600
killing many animals,
everything changed.

8
00:00:54,111 --> 00:00:59,811
Taku He were deeply angry
and many died by his rage.

9
00:00:59,884 --> 00:01:01,647
I n revenge,

10
00:01:01,719 --> 00:01:05,052
the white men spilled the
innocent blood of my people.

11
00:01:05,122 --> 00:01:09,252
It was a time
of great sorrow and hatred.

12
00:01:11,862 --> 00:01:15,525
Even today, when mountain
spirits claim a life,

13
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,092
it is we
who are held in contempt.

14
00:01:21,105 --> 00:01:24,734
There are even those
who wish us dead.

15
00:01:33,684 --> 00:01:35,379
What the hell
are you shooting at?

16
00:01:35,453 --> 00:01:37,512
I've seen somethin'
over there.

17
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,718
Now, that's how you kill
a tree stump.

18
00:01:45,796 --> 00:01:48,731
You idiots are scared of a
creature off in the woods.

19
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:51,563
I n case you don't remember,
we're here to kill a bear.

20
00:01:51,636 --> 00:01:55,094
Spread out. We only got a couple
of hours of day light left.

21
00:01:55,172 --> 00:01:57,072
Spread out!

22
00:03:30,034 --> 00:03:31,194
What the hell?

23
00:04:18,182 --> 00:04:20,582
Jimbo!

24
00:04:20,651 --> 00:04:22,084
Colonel!

25
00:05:09,667 --> 00:05:10,656
Jimbo.

26
00:05:52,243 --> 00:05:53,471
Mom.

27
00:05:55,913 --> 00:05:59,610
I must've dozed off.
Let me make you something.

28
00:05:59,683 --> 00:06:01,548
No, not much wanting
for this first period.

29
00:06:01,619 --> 00:06:02,711
Oh, no.

30
00:06:02,786 --> 00:06:05,914
Okay.
Bye, mom.

31
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:07,389
Oh!
Your dad called.

32
00:06:07,458 --> 00:06:09,983
He wants you to spend
spring break in his place.

33
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:11,994
I can't.

34
00:06:13,163 --> 00:06:15,427
You can't punish him
forever, you know.

35
00:07:43,354 --> 00:07:46,414
As we all know, next week
is spring break week.

36
00:07:48,492 --> 00:07:50,858
Your endangered
species projects are due

37
00:07:50,928 --> 00:07:52,361
the Monday we return.

38
00:07:53,764 --> 00:07:57,222
I don't make up the curricula.
I just enforce it.

39
00:07:57,301 --> 00:08:00,862
Now, for those professional
procrastinators among us

40
00:08:00,938 --> 00:08:02,667
who have yet
to select the topic,

41
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:04,640
just remember,

42
00:08:06,043 --> 00:08:08,204
Seeing as that you
already know all of this,

43
00:08:08,278 --> 00:08:13,409
perhaps you'd like to give us an example
of an endangered species, Mr. Kelter.

44
00:08:13,484 --> 00:08:14,781
Mr. Kelter.

45
00:08:16,286 --> 00:08:17,344
Mr. Kelter!

46
00:08:17,421 --> 00:08:20,083
Uhm, uh... Shea.

47
00:08:20,157 --> 00:08:22,057
Definitely Shea.

48
00:08:22,126 --> 00:08:23,821
Did you hear the question?

49
00:08:23,894 --> 00:08:26,988
Yeah. You were talking about
endangered species.

50
00:08:27,064 --> 00:08:29,760
It just kinda looks to me
like pretty girls around here

51
00:08:29,833 --> 00:08:32,165
are becoming
an endangered species.

52
00:08:32,236 --> 00:08:35,797
After class, Kelter, will
discuss your endangered grade.

53
00:08:35,873 --> 00:08:40,003
Mr. Winslow, perhaps
you'd like to help us out.

54
00:08:45,049 --> 00:08:46,141
Uh.

55
00:08:46,216 --> 00:08:50,482
Woodland caribou,
the gray wolf,

56
00:08:50,554 --> 00:08:53,455
short-tailed albatross,
brown pelican,

57
00:08:53,524 --> 00:08:58,018
white-tailed deer, spidered
owl, leatherback sea turtle.

58
00:08:58,095 --> 00:09:01,758
Uh, sea otter,
grizzly bear.

59
00:09:01,832 --> 00:09:03,993
The Sasquatch.

60
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:08,163
That's nine
out of then.

61
00:09:08,238 --> 00:09:11,674
Now, if you could just
duplicate that on a test.

62
00:09:11,742 --> 00:09:15,178
Why don't you join
Mr. Kelter and I after class?

63
00:09:15,245 --> 00:09:17,713
Mr. Vancamp,
did you hear?

64
00:09:17,781 --> 00:09:21,239
A bunch of guys got killed by a huge
grizzly bear up in Echo Mountain.

65
00:09:21,318 --> 00:09:22,979
A bunch of guys!

66
00:09:23,053 --> 00:09:26,284
Yeah, like ten or something. They
said it was really bad. Totally sick.

67
00:09:28,759 --> 00:09:30,989
Well, there you have it.

68
00:09:31,061 --> 00:09:33,552
Well, enjoy your spring break

69
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:37,430
and please, please, whatever you
do, stay away from killer bears.

70
00:09:37,501 --> 00:09:39,196
Jay!

71
00:09:39,269 --> 00:09:41,737
Sorry.
I almost forgot.

72
00:09:41,805 --> 00:09:44,831
Just like you forgot your
homework for the last three weeks.

73
00:09:44,908 --> 00:09:49,072
Listen, you're precariously
close to not passing this class.

74
00:09:49,146 --> 00:09:51,444
That means
you won't graduate.

75
00:09:51,515 --> 00:09:53,881
What are you talking about?
I have to graduate.

76
00:09:53,951 --> 00:09:59,253
Mr. Kelter, graduation is a
privilege, not a requirement.

77
00:09:59,323 --> 00:10:03,316
That's why I've decided
to team the both of you up.

78
00:10:03,393 --> 00:10:04,485
What? Why?

79
00:10:04,561 --> 00:10:06,153
You're joking, right?

80
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:09,097
"He who helps others,
helps himself."

81
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:10,895
I don't need his help.

82
00:10:10,968 --> 00:10:13,095
I can't help.

83
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:15,832
Gentlemen, let me put
it to you in this light.

84
00:10:15,906 --> 00:10:20,172
If the two of you together

85
00:10:20,244 --> 00:10:24,681
don't produce an in-depth
presentation by Monday after next,

86
00:10:24,748 --> 00:10:27,046
one of you will be leaving
with an incomplete,

87
00:10:27,117 --> 00:10:30,143
and the other
won't be leaving at all.

88
00:10:32,222 --> 00:10:34,156
You didn't say
it was this bad.

89
00:10:36,226 --> 00:10:39,821
Bear attack? Can't
expect it to be pretty.

90
00:10:41,565 --> 00:10:43,294
Gotta get this
cleaned up.

91
00:10:43,367 --> 00:10:45,426
You have to get
this cleaned up, Sheriff.

92
00:10:45,502 --> 00:10:48,938
Tourists are gonna be up here
in a few weeks.

93
00:10:49,006 --> 00:10:52,601
It's all bull hairs. That big motor
is gonna drive right past Pine Creek.

94
00:10:52,676 --> 00:10:55,543
They'll think there's a killer
bear on the loose up here.

95
00:10:55,612 --> 00:10:57,842
We gotta control this
before it controls us.

96
00:10:57,915 --> 00:11:00,907
I've called the town
meeting for tonight.

97
00:11:00,984 --> 00:11:04,351
Calling meetings, Kassel? Are you
trying to give me another ulcer?

98
00:11:04,421 --> 00:11:06,013
That'll add fuel
to the fire!

99
00:11:06,089 --> 00:11:08,580
We cant let this get out.
Do you understand that?

100
00:11:08,659 --> 00:11:12,095
I understand that my job is to
protect the people of this town.

101
00:11:12,162 --> 00:11:15,461
They have the right to know there's
a pissed off predator out here.

102
00:11:15,532 --> 00:11:17,159
You don't know that, yet.

103
00:11:17,234 --> 00:11:20,897
If I read one word about this in
any paper but our own local dish rag,

104
00:11:20,971 --> 00:11:23,997
you're gonna have a tough time
finding work in Alaska.

105
00:11:24,074 --> 00:11:25,507
What's that, John?

106
00:11:27,377 --> 00:11:29,311
Nothing.

107
00:11:29,379 --> 00:11:33,076
Maybe all-knowing Indian
around here, Eagleheart.

108
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:35,914
What do you think we should
do with this vile creature?

109
00:11:35,986 --> 00:11:38,284
It's a noble savage.

110
00:11:38,355 --> 00:11:41,347
It's nice of you to think so,
Mayor, but I'm just a ranger.

111
00:11:41,425 --> 00:11:44,861
Listen, we've contacted
the Federal Game Warden.

112
00:11:44,928 --> 00:11:47,897
He'll be here with some
tracking dogs in a day or two.

113
00:11:47,965 --> 00:11:50,365
Until then, Eagleheart
and I will try to find it.

114
00:11:50,434 --> 00:11:52,902
I don't give a rat's ass
who does it or how you do it.

115
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:55,939
You just make sure this thing
is last week's news.

116
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:03,371
Johnson!
That way.

117
00:12:03,447 --> 00:12:07,349
Don't get too far ahead of us
or you'll be tomorrow's news.

118
00:12:10,687 --> 00:12:13,019
You don't really think
a bear did this, do you?

119
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:15,183
You ever heard of a bear
killing three men?

120
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:18,894
Well, it's what Janzer claims.

121
00:12:18,962 --> 00:12:21,658
Well, the poacher claims
it's a bear.

122
00:12:21,732 --> 00:12:24,496
Let's call it that.
It's probably better...

123
00:12:24,568 --> 00:12:26,559
Better than what?

124
00:12:26,637 --> 00:12:29,003
Listen, don't answer that.

125
00:12:29,072 --> 00:12:31,700
My only job
is to keep people happy.

126
00:12:31,775 --> 00:12:36,405
Unfortunately, those people are gonna
want blood for this. You know that.

127
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:40,883
I'm sure those yahoos have wounded
enough bears to make that easy.

128
00:12:40,951 --> 00:12:43,920
Listen, I'll head above the
falls and see what I can find.

129
00:12:43,987 --> 00:12:46,217
I give you two days.

130
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:48,190
But take care of you, John.

131
00:12:48,258 --> 00:12:50,590
For God's sakes, keep
you radio on, will you?

132
00:12:50,661 --> 00:12:53,926
I don't wanna have to come back
here and rescue you, you noble ass.

133
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,124
Jesus, man!

134
00:13:31,201 --> 00:13:32,361
What's up?

135
00:13:32,436 --> 00:13:34,597
That's a really nice bike
you got there.

136
00:13:34,671 --> 00:13:37,037
My sister's got a tutu
that'll match that real good.

137
00:13:37,107 --> 00:13:38,438
I hope it's pretty.

138
00:13:38,508 --> 00:13:41,033
Look, I ain't going back
here next year. Got that?

139
00:13:41,111 --> 00:13:42,669
You and I
don't like each other.

140
00:13:42,746 --> 00:13:44,373
We don't have
to like each other.

141
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:46,279
We just have
to work together.

142
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:50,081
Unless you get an incomplete, I suggest
you be at the town meeting tonight.

143
00:13:50,153 --> 00:13:51,620
Why is that, Jay?

144
00:13:51,688 --> 00:13:54,680
Because you said yourself
bears are an endangered species.

145
00:13:54,758 --> 00:13:56,521
It's grizzlies.

146
00:13:56,593 --> 00:13:58,561
Okay, whatever,
dick Britannica.

147
00:13:58,628 --> 00:14:00,061
Just be there, right?

148
00:14:02,966 --> 00:14:05,366
Oh, yeah.
By the way,

149
00:14:05,435 --> 00:14:09,030
my cousin Jenny,
she likes you.

150
00:14:09,106 --> 00:14:11,199
Don't ask me why.

151
00:14:11,274 --> 00:14:13,174
She's gonna be there
tonight, too.

152
00:15:00,891 --> 00:15:04,019
Jenny, Richard.
Richard, Jenny.

153
00:15:04,094 --> 00:15:07,461
You're the one that's coming with
us to the mountains this weekend.

154
00:15:07,531 --> 00:15:10,364
What? No.

155
00:15:10,434 --> 00:15:11,992
Jenny wants to come
along too,

156
00:15:12,069 --> 00:15:14,469
but I told her I didn't think
that was a good idea.

157
00:15:14,538 --> 00:15:15,766
That wouldn't be.

158
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:18,808
Why? I can handle it
myself, okay?

159
00:15:20,744 --> 00:15:23,338
Can you hear me?

160
00:15:23,413 --> 00:15:24,675
Good evening.

161
00:15:24,748 --> 00:15:27,945
Uh... the Mayor
isn't here, yet.

162
00:15:28,018 --> 00:15:30,543
So I think
I'll just get started.

163
00:15:32,355 --> 00:15:34,755
I wanna thank all of you
for coming out tonight.

164
00:15:34,825 --> 00:15:38,022
I know many of you are busy getting
ready for the tourist season,

165
00:15:38,095 --> 00:15:42,498
so... I'll just cut
to the chase.

166
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:45,501
Yesterday, as some of you
already know,

167
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:48,800
there was a bear attack
up on Echo Mountain.

168
00:15:48,872 --> 00:15:51,397
Unfortunately,
three men were killed

169
00:15:51,475 --> 00:15:53,705
and a fourth
was very, very lucky.

170
00:15:53,777 --> 00:15:55,768
Taku He has returned.

171
00:15:55,846 --> 00:15:58,679
Ed Janzer was found
by ranger Eagleheart

172
00:15:58,748 --> 00:16:02,115
who happened to be
in the area of the attack.

173
00:16:02,185 --> 00:16:04,653
Mr. Mayor.

174
00:16:04,721 --> 00:16:07,315
And brought back
to town.

175
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:12,828
Ed was shaken up pretty badly, but I'm
happy to report he's going to be alright.

176
00:16:12,896 --> 00:16:16,730
I've contacted
the Federal Game Warden.

177
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,825
They have a couple
of Karelian bear dogs

178
00:16:18,902 --> 00:16:21,234
who'll track the animal down
and kill it.

179
00:16:21,304 --> 00:16:24,569
The problem is they're
over in Montana right now

180
00:16:24,641 --> 00:16:26,973
and won't be able to
get here for a few days.

181
00:16:27,043 --> 00:16:29,034
I think you'll see
after looking it over

182
00:16:29,112 --> 00:16:31,376
we really don't have much
to worry about.

183
00:16:31,448 --> 00:16:34,542
Not much to worry about?
Sheriff, what about the tourists?

184
00:16:34,618 --> 00:16:38,918
I'm sure the Mayor will
wanna comment on that but, uh,

185
00:16:38,989 --> 00:16:41,981
my concern is for your safety
and the safety of our visitors.

186
00:16:42,058 --> 00:16:44,822
What are we supposed to do
in the mean time, stay inside?

187
00:16:44,895 --> 00:16:46,419
No.

188
00:16:46,496 --> 00:16:49,260
For what it's worth, those
men were up there illegally

189
00:16:49,332 --> 00:16:51,664
and probably got between
the saw and her cubs.

190
00:16:51,735 --> 00:16:53,828
If they go up there
and shoot that bear,

191
00:16:53,904 --> 00:16:55,895
then the press
is gonna come up here.

192
00:16:55,972 --> 00:17:00,204
We sure as hell don't need any one dredging
up ridiculous monster stories again.

193
00:17:00,277 --> 00:17:03,610
Exactly. That's why there isn't
going to be any press coverage.

194
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,148
Our town needs
those tourism dollars.

195
00:17:06,216 --> 00:17:09,515
How the bear's handled is our
business. The important thing for us

196
00:17:09,586 --> 00:17:12,146
is you just keep doing
what we've done for years.

197
00:17:12,222 --> 00:17:16,090
We can't let misguided
reporters and crazy rumors

198
00:17:16,159 --> 00:17:17,854
ruin our good town.

199
00:17:17,928 --> 00:17:20,328
Why do they have
to kill the bear?

200
00:17:20,397 --> 00:17:24,060
When a bear kills a human,
they usually destroy it.

201
00:17:24,134 --> 00:17:25,931
Would you kill it?

202
00:17:26,002 --> 00:17:28,238
Me? No.

203
00:17:28,405 --> 00:17:30,965
You gonna take
that shot or what?

204
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:36,270
Here's 20.
Says you gonna scratch again.

205
00:17:36,346 --> 00:17:40,612
I can't believe you boys are in
here playing pool and bullshitting

206
00:17:40,684 --> 00:17:43,414
when your buddies are
rotting up on that mountain,

207
00:17:43,486 --> 00:17:46,944
'cause of some pied-face
park ranger.

208
00:17:47,023 --> 00:17:53,121
The way we hear was that
that Indian saved your heart.

209
00:17:53,196 --> 00:17:57,223
Besides, Sheriff said if anyone was caught
up there, we were gonna get arrested.

210
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:02,169
Ray, when in your life have
you ever paid attention to law?

211
00:18:02,239 --> 00:18:05,697
That Indian's gonna have
his ass handed to him.

212
00:18:05,775 --> 00:18:07,902
I bet you money on that.

213
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:12,212
They way
he took care of you?

214
00:18:12,282 --> 00:18:13,613
Son of a bitch!

215
00:18:13,683 --> 00:18:14,980
Come on!

216
00:18:15,051 --> 00:18:17,451
What are you doing to me?
We're you there?

217
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,181
I had that bear
in my sights.

218
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:23,554
I came too, boys.

219
00:18:24,594 --> 00:18:27,256
The boys
were ripped to pieces.

220
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:29,230
I've never seen
that much blood.

221
00:18:32,202 --> 00:18:33,829
Who's with me?

222
00:18:33,903 --> 00:18:36,201
This thing has got "A" written
all over it.

223
00:18:36,273 --> 00:18:38,138
That's A for ass.

224
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:42,871
Alright, genius, wha...
what do you wanna do, huh?

225
00:18:42,946 --> 00:18:45,744
You wanna go hit the library?
Stick your nose in a book?

226
00:18:45,815 --> 00:18:48,181
Copy some pictures, huh?

227
00:18:48,251 --> 00:18:50,583
That sounds
real exciting, dude!

228
00:18:50,654 --> 00:18:54,021
You're pitiful, man. No
wonder you're still a virgin.

229
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:57,389
I just wanna have
a good time, alright?

230
00:18:57,460 --> 00:19:01,556
Look, I'm gonna give you an equation
for you to learn. This is very important.

231
00:19:01,631 --> 00:19:06,500
Couple of girls plus
couple of beers equals fun!

232
00:19:06,569 --> 00:19:08,867
And what about
graduating, huh?

233
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:11,607
Did you say
a couple of girls?

234
00:19:13,877 --> 00:19:15,401
Evening, Trish.

235
00:19:15,478 --> 00:19:17,275
Bye, Eddie.

236
00:19:29,426 --> 00:19:30,825
How are you doing, Kassel?

237
00:19:32,662 --> 00:19:34,323
Evening, Ed.

238
00:19:34,397 --> 00:19:36,797
Look, I already told you
everything I know.

239
00:19:36,866 --> 00:19:39,562
Right when I seen that bear
I got knocked out.

240
00:19:39,636 --> 00:19:42,127
Would you like to check?

241
00:19:42,205 --> 00:19:45,299
That's not what
I'm concerned about, Ed.

242
00:19:45,375 --> 00:19:48,867
I'm concerned that you might be
planning on doing something stupid.

243
00:19:48,945 --> 00:19:51,505
Something
you might regret.

244
00:19:53,049 --> 00:19:54,539
Wouldn't be
the first time.

245
00:19:54,617 --> 00:19:57,711
It'll be the last if you
go near Echo Mountain again.

246
00:19:59,155 --> 00:20:00,884
Poaching is a crime, Ed.

247
00:20:00,957 --> 00:20:03,687
The only reason you're not
behind bars tonight

248
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,388
is because
your buddies are dead.

249
00:20:06,463 --> 00:20:10,729
So, if you're even thinking about
going back there, think again.

250
00:20:13,269 --> 00:20:15,066
Thanks for this talk, Sheriff.

251
00:20:16,272 --> 00:20:18,399
Go home, Ed.

252
00:21:00,483 --> 00:21:01,916
Who is going again?

253
00:21:01,985 --> 00:21:04,579
Me, Jenny,
Rich, and Shea.

254
00:21:04,654 --> 00:21:07,054
It's bad enough I'm letting
you take your cousin.

255
00:21:07,123 --> 00:21:10,354
Momma, come on! Shea is
Richard's girlfriend, okay?

256
00:21:10,427 --> 00:21:13,590
When we'll you be back?
And who's Rich?

257
00:21:13,663 --> 00:21:17,929
Sunday or Monday. Rich
Winslow, Doris Winslow's son.

258
00:21:18,001 --> 00:21:21,630
Oh, oh, Doris, from
the diner. Nice lady.

259
00:21:23,106 --> 00:21:25,734
Since when are you friends
with her son?

260
00:21:25,809 --> 00:21:27,743
Oh, my God, mom!
I told you.

261
00:21:27,811 --> 00:21:30,109
I just need his brains
so I can pass biology,

262
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:32,273
so I can graduate,
remember?

263
00:21:32,348 --> 00:21:35,044
Well, I suppose.

264
00:21:35,118 --> 00:21:40,454
Just stay away from where
the bear is. And no drinking!

265
00:21:40,523 --> 00:21:44,755
Don't worry, mom. I'll be too busy
working on my six pack to drink.

266
00:21:46,529 --> 00:21:48,759
Woo!
Now we're huntin' boys!

267
00:21:48,832 --> 00:21:52,495
Yeah. When you shut your mouth and
open your eyes, then you'll be hunting.

268
00:21:52,569 --> 00:21:55,902
Okay.
So, what's the plan?

269
00:21:55,972 --> 00:21:59,635
We're gonna drive over these two
next ridges as far as we can get

270
00:21:59,709 --> 00:22:01,472
and we're gonna
set up camp.

271
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:05,845
A beer.

272
00:22:07,484 --> 00:22:11,079
Hey, are you really gonna kill
Eagleheart if we come across him?

273
00:22:14,090 --> 00:22:16,923
I'm gonna make me
a bear claw necklace.

274
00:22:19,162 --> 00:22:22,757
Look, we've been over this.

275
00:22:22,832 --> 00:22:26,598
All I'm asking is for permission
to go in there with a few guys

276
00:22:26,669 --> 00:22:28,864
before your men
with the dogs get here.

277
00:22:28,938 --> 00:22:30,803
Before somebody else
gets killed!

278
00:22:30,874 --> 00:22:32,774
We need that in writing.

279
00:22:32,842 --> 00:22:34,605
You need it in writing?

280
00:22:34,677 --> 00:22:37,168
Approved by a judge.
Great.

281
00:22:39,115 --> 00:22:41,845
We need it in writing.
It has to be legal.

282
00:22:41,918 --> 00:22:44,887
Okay, fine.
I'll play your little game.

283
00:22:44,954 --> 00:22:48,583
But know this. One more person
from this town gets killed,

284
00:22:48,658 --> 00:22:51,422
and I'll shove that court
injunction so far up your ass

285
00:22:51,494 --> 00:22:54,224
your gums will bleed.

286
00:22:54,297 --> 00:22:56,162
You too, Sir.
Have a nice day.

287
00:22:56,232 --> 00:23:00,134
That better be the Game Warden saying he's
gonna be here first thing in the morning.

288
00:23:00,203 --> 00:23:01,192
You missed some.

289
00:23:01,271 --> 00:23:03,262
Huh?

290
00:23:03,339 --> 00:23:05,773
Tasty cream filling?

291
00:23:05,842 --> 00:23:09,505
Look, so far I've managed to
keep this tale from growing legs

292
00:23:09,579 --> 00:23:12,104
and turning it into another
Echo Mountain legend.

293
00:23:12,181 --> 00:23:14,376
It was a massacre actually.

294
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:17,578
The point is you need
to hold up your end

295
00:23:17,654 --> 00:23:19,485
and get this bear
taken care of.

296
00:23:19,556 --> 00:23:22,218
I don't want it transplant
it, either. I want it dead.

297
00:23:22,292 --> 00:23:24,351
We can't have the thing
coming back here.

298
00:23:24,427 --> 00:23:28,488
I know, I know. We can't have
the tourists getting eaten alive.

299
00:23:28,565 --> 00:23:31,557
Is that all you care about?
The tourists?

300
00:23:31,634 --> 00:23:33,795
The tourists
pay my salary.

301
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:36,395
And they pay
your salary.

302
00:23:36,472 --> 00:23:41,136
Do your job, Sheriff Kassel,
while you still have one.

303
00:23:42,879 --> 00:23:44,904
Yes, Sir!

304
00:23:49,018 --> 00:23:51,953
Mr. Tasty cream filling.

305
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:05,292
What time is it?

306
00:24:06,836 --> 00:24:09,202
It's 12:15.

307
00:24:11,507 --> 00:24:14,999
I told you bear bull
was going to fail out on us.

308
00:24:15,078 --> 00:24:16,568
He'll be here.

309
00:24:16,646 --> 00:24:17,840
He won't!

310
00:24:17,914 --> 00:24:19,404
Trust me.

311
00:24:22,752 --> 00:24:26,711
Just so you know, the grizzly
bear stands over nine feet tall

312
00:24:26,789 --> 00:24:29,883
and weighs
over 1, 500 pounds.

313
00:24:29,959 --> 00:24:32,427
Do you still wanna go?

314
00:24:36,766 --> 00:24:39,826
Put the dogs out!

315
00:24:47,276 --> 00:24:51,975
This is great!
Woo!

316
00:24:56,552 --> 00:24:57,814
Hey!

317
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:02,287
Forgot to get gas.

318
00:25:03,626 --> 00:25:06,117
You stupid
son of a bitch!

319
00:25:08,765 --> 00:25:11,928
So what we doin'?
Huntin' or campin'?

320
00:25:12,001 --> 00:25:14,595
What are we gonna do with
my jeep? Just leave it here?

321
00:25:14,671 --> 00:25:17,504
You're the one that ran out
of gas. What do you think?

322
00:25:17,573 --> 00:25:19,564
Go and get elated.

323
00:25:19,642 --> 00:25:22,577
How are we gonna get
out of here now? Walk?

324
00:25:24,614 --> 00:25:28,641
Hey, guys! Good camp
spot right by the creek.

325
00:25:28,718 --> 00:25:31,050
And I got dinner, too.

326
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:33,350
We got steaks tonight, Tom!

327
00:25:33,423 --> 00:25:34,754
Steaks?

328
00:25:34,824 --> 00:25:35,813
Yeah!

329
00:25:36,959 --> 00:25:39,951
He's got a wood rat!
Woo!

330
00:25:40,029 --> 00:25:43,760
Woo-hoo!
Let me see that thing!

331
00:25:43,833 --> 00:25:46,165
You're a hot nail.
C'mon!

332
00:25:46,235 --> 00:25:48,203
You're crazy.
You're not a woodman.

333
00:25:56,779 --> 00:25:58,440
Jay.
God!

334
00:25:58,514 --> 00:26:02,348
You left a note. You told me your
parents said it was gonna be okay.

335
00:26:02,418 --> 00:26:05,785
Since when do you care what
my parents think about you?

336
00:26:05,855 --> 00:26:09,951
He's got a reputation
to uphold.

337
00:26:11,928 --> 00:26:15,022
I least I got one, dicker.

338
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,660
Looks like someone
couldn't wait.

339
00:26:45,728 --> 00:26:48,390
You think we should go ahead
and drive through?

340
00:26:48,464 --> 00:26:51,456
No, there's no reason to.
The trail starts right here.

341
00:26:51,534 --> 00:26:54,560
Are we gonna like close
to where the attacks were?

342
00:26:54,637 --> 00:26:58,073
I don't know. They didn't say last
night. They said up by the falls.

343
00:26:58,141 --> 00:27:00,405
Are we gonna go
up there?

344
00:27:03,579 --> 00:27:05,240
I don't see why not!

345
00:27:08,684 --> 00:27:12,711
I suppose you brought the guns seeing that
you're dying to go where the action is.

346
00:27:12,789 --> 00:27:16,691
No. My old man locked up the gun
cabinet before he left. He hid the key.

347
00:27:16,759 --> 00:27:18,158
What about you?

348
00:27:18,227 --> 00:27:20,821
I don't have
an old man.

349
00:27:20,897 --> 00:27:23,331
It's okay.
I brought bear repellent.

350
00:27:25,668 --> 00:27:27,761
Hey, do you wanna hold
my stupid sign?

351
00:27:27,837 --> 00:27:29,236
Bears don't have anything.

352
00:27:29,305 --> 00:27:31,773
Follow the stones, you get
to spray yourself his flavor

353
00:27:31,841 --> 00:27:35,174
and for the bear
like to pass or something.

354
00:27:35,244 --> 00:27:38,111
Go ahead and laugh.
At least I'm gonna feel safe.

355
00:27:46,389 --> 00:27:48,448
Wait, you guys.
Hang on a sec.

356
00:27:48,524 --> 00:27:52,016
This is for all of you that
are just tuning in right now.

357
00:27:52,094 --> 00:27:55,291
This is the real deal right here.
There's no fake stuff going on.

358
00:27:55,364 --> 00:27:58,765
This is the tale of, one,
two, three, four horny kids

359
00:27:58,835 --> 00:28:01,463
and their journey
up into the back country.

360
00:28:01,537 --> 00:28:04,199
The journey that will
lead them face to face

361
00:28:04,273 --> 00:28:06,207
with the killer
the grizzly bear.

362
00:28:06,275 --> 00:28:09,005
The journey that
could be their last.

363
00:28:11,447 --> 00:28:12,937
Woo!

364
00:28:51,254 --> 00:28:52,881
It's beautiful up here.

365
00:28:52,955 --> 00:28:54,752
Yes, it is.

366
00:28:54,824 --> 00:28:57,019
You come up here
by yourself?

367
00:28:57,093 --> 00:28:59,084
Sure, why not?

368
00:28:59,161 --> 00:29:00,822
Don't you get scared?

369
00:29:00,897 --> 00:29:04,890
No. I don't feel it's anymore
scared of you than you are of it.

370
00:29:04,967 --> 00:29:07,902
So you think this bear
is scared of us?

371
00:29:07,970 --> 00:29:09,961
Well, assuming
it was a bear.

372
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:13,202
Dick, what took those men
if it wasn't a bear, huh?

373
00:29:13,276 --> 00:29:14,709
It's Rich.

374
00:29:14,777 --> 00:29:17,678
No, it's okay, Jenny. My gram
used to call me little Dick.

375
00:29:17,747 --> 00:29:19,738
Not even Jay
can do worse than that.

376
00:29:21,284 --> 00:29:24,583
You really wanna know
what I think killed those men?

377
00:29:28,758 --> 00:29:30,191
Didn't I ask you?

378
00:29:30,259 --> 00:29:32,193
Okay.
Me!

379
00:29:34,163 --> 00:29:35,858
Not funny.

380
00:29:47,076 --> 00:29:48,304
Are you okay?

381
00:29:48,377 --> 00:29:50,140
You scared me.

382
00:29:50,212 --> 00:29:54,205
I'm sorry.
I'm not so good for this.

383
00:29:54,283 --> 00:29:55,648
What is it?

384
00:29:55,718 --> 00:29:59,916
Nothing. I have the feeling
that something's watching me.

385
00:29:59,989 --> 00:30:03,686
Oh, it's just me.
Come on.

386
00:30:15,137 --> 00:30:17,230
Alright, this is good.

387
00:30:17,306 --> 00:30:18,898
I like it.

388
00:30:20,543 --> 00:30:23,444
I see what you mean
with the sound.

389
00:30:23,512 --> 00:30:26,572
Alright, you guys just
set up the tents right here

390
00:30:26,649 --> 00:30:29,083
and I'll go round up some firewood.

391
00:30:32,288 --> 00:30:36,190
Hey, Richard and you
have some stuff up here, huh?

392
00:30:36,258 --> 00:30:39,625
I sure feel a lot safer
having him around.

393
00:30:39,695 --> 00:30:43,290
Me too, you guys. He's
just so rugged and handsome.

394
00:30:43,366 --> 00:30:46,164
You know, you're just lucky
he agreed to come along.

395
00:30:46,235 --> 00:30:48,726
Yeah, real lucky.

396
00:32:02,845 --> 00:32:04,608
Darling, you're beautiful.

397
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:07,513
No, give me the camera.

398
00:32:09,518 --> 00:32:13,113
Hey! David Crockett!
What took you so long?

399
00:32:15,091 --> 00:32:17,389
There's a... grizzly.

400
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:20,395
Just now?
Where?

401
00:32:20,463 --> 00:32:22,863
Right up over there.

402
00:32:24,366 --> 00:32:26,163
Sure it wasn't a squirrel?

403
00:32:26,235 --> 00:32:29,329
Yeah, yeah. It was as big and
heavy just like your mother.

404
00:32:29,405 --> 00:32:32,499
Do you think that
it was the same bear that...

405
00:32:32,575 --> 00:32:35,772
No, no. This bear wasn't
interested in killing anybody.

406
00:32:37,213 --> 00:32:38,646
What did you do,
Nature boy?

407
00:32:39,682 --> 00:32:41,172
I did what
we should always do.

408
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:44,378
Yeah? Did you cry like a
little girl and wet yourself?

409
00:32:44,453 --> 00:32:45,681
I stood there.

410
00:32:47,022 --> 00:32:48,489
Jay, grow up.

411
00:32:49,825 --> 00:32:50,814
What?

412
00:32:50,893 --> 00:32:52,827
I'm gonna go change.

413
00:32:55,731 --> 00:32:57,221
I would've run.

414
00:32:57,299 --> 00:32:58,459
Oh, no.

415
00:32:58,534 --> 00:33:00,058
You never outrun a bear.

416
00:33:00,136 --> 00:33:02,604
It's the whole fight
or flight response.

417
00:33:02,671 --> 00:33:05,640
If you flee, you're just...
you're like a rabbit or a deer,

418
00:33:05,708 --> 00:33:10,611
but if you stay and if you hold your
ground, then you might have a chance.

419
00:33:10,679 --> 00:33:13,546
Dude, you are so
full of crap.

420
00:33:13,616 --> 00:33:15,413
I don't believe a word of this. Damn!

421
00:33:15,484 --> 00:33:17,577
Really?
Okay.

422
00:33:17,653 --> 00:33:19,644
What about
a thousand words?

423
00:33:27,897 --> 00:33:29,330
Deal!

424
00:33:29,398 --> 00:33:32,390
Jay! Oh, my God, you're such
a pervert! Get out of here.

425
00:33:32,468 --> 00:33:36,268
I'm just recording the
scenery for my project, baby.

426
00:34:36,665 --> 00:34:39,133
You cook like you drive.

427
00:34:39,201 --> 00:34:41,362
Yeah, you just
keep it up, Ed.

428
00:34:41,437 --> 00:34:43,667
You'll be gettin' hit
on the head again

429
00:34:43,739 --> 00:34:47,004
and this time
it won't be from no bear.

430
00:34:47,076 --> 00:34:50,512
How many times I gotta tell you
it was no bear hitting on my head.

431
00:34:50,579 --> 00:34:52,069
It was cheap dumb ass!

432
00:34:54,083 --> 00:34:55,345
You see that?

433
00:34:56,819 --> 00:34:58,582
Be quiet for a minute.

434
00:34:58,654 --> 00:35:00,645
What?

435
00:35:00,723 --> 00:35:03,191
I don't know.
I thought I saw something.

436
00:35:03,259 --> 00:35:06,786
It's the woods. Stuff moves. Now cook.

437
00:35:08,397 --> 00:35:11,594
Leo, cook, damn it!

438
00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:17,132
Mac cheese and ketchup.

439
00:35:17,206 --> 00:35:20,573
It's a dinner of
champions, baby. Yeah! What!

440
00:35:22,745 --> 00:35:24,679
M mm, mmm.

441
00:35:25,981 --> 00:35:27,573
Hey, want some?

442
00:35:27,650 --> 00:35:28,810
No, thanks.

443
00:35:28,884 --> 00:35:30,215
Tastes good.

444
00:35:30,286 --> 00:35:34,086
I'm sure after next year,
when we all broke college

445
00:35:34,156 --> 00:35:36,750
we'll be sick and tired
of Mac and cheese.

446
00:35:36,825 --> 00:35:39,487
Why don't you tell us
a story Rich?

447
00:35:39,561 --> 00:35:41,256
Something scary.

448
00:35:41,330 --> 00:35:44,299
We need to decide who's
sleeping in which tent.

449
00:35:44,366 --> 00:35:47,563
I mean, if you're gonna go
tell scary stories,

450
00:35:47,636 --> 00:35:50,662
specially ones
having to do with bears,

451
00:35:50,739 --> 00:35:54,368
I'm not gonna sleep alone.
Jay?

452
00:35:54,443 --> 00:35:57,037
What?
I didn't say anything.

453
00:35:57,112 --> 00:35:59,740
No, okay.
You can sleep by me,

454
00:35:59,815 --> 00:36:03,410
but don't try
anything funny, okay?

455
00:36:03,485 --> 00:36:06,386
C'mon, Shea, there's
nothing funny about sex!

456
00:36:08,257 --> 00:36:12,489
Okay. Now that we have that
dealt with, let's hear your story.

457
00:36:12,561 --> 00:36:14,426
Wait.
Before you start,

458
00:36:15,831 --> 00:36:17,025
I gotta get this
on tape.

459
00:36:17,099 --> 00:36:18,361
Everything?

460
00:36:18,434 --> 00:36:22,962
Uh-huh. Otherwise,
well, if I don't,

461
00:36:23,038 --> 00:36:27,134
how else am I gonna show Vancamp
that his golden boy drinks beer?

462
00:36:29,311 --> 00:36:32,769
Besides, it's all part
of the project, specially

463
00:36:32,848 --> 00:36:34,816
if the bear gets us!

464
00:36:34,883 --> 00:36:36,180
Stop!

465
00:36:36,251 --> 00:36:38,048
Sorry.

466
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:40,611
Smile.

467
00:36:40,689 --> 00:36:42,054
Alright, go ahead.

468
00:36:42,124 --> 00:36:45,855
Before Pine Creek
was settled,

469
00:36:45,928 --> 00:36:49,091
and long before Echo
Mountain was a preserve,

470
00:36:49,164 --> 00:36:52,224
this whole area was sacred land
to the Indians who lived here.

471
00:36:52,301 --> 00:36:55,202
They didn't hunt,
fish, nothing.

472
00:36:55,270 --> 00:36:59,434
And to the Indians, Echo
Mountain was no man's land.

473
00:36:59,508 --> 00:37:01,738
Why did they call it
Echo Mountain anyways?

474
00:37:01,810 --> 00:37:05,974
The Indians claim that
if you called out at night,

475
00:37:06,048 --> 00:37:08,039
something would answer you.

476
00:37:08,117 --> 00:37:09,607
Something
or someone?

477
00:37:09,685 --> 00:37:14,384
Hey, Jenny, for the love of all
that's holy, please, shut up!

478
00:37:14,456 --> 00:37:16,083
Sorry.

479
00:37:17,893 --> 00:37:23,559
Now, the spring of 1891, a few miners
passing through discovered gold here.

480
00:37:23,632 --> 00:37:27,534
They didn't want word to get out, so
they built a small clandestine settlement

481
00:37:27,603 --> 00:37:30,128
and began mining.

482
00:37:30,205 --> 00:37:32,036
The natives dldn't like it,

483
00:37:32,107 --> 00:37:34,940
but they're the peaceful klnd
that kept to themselves.

484
00:37:35,010 --> 00:37:37,706
Everythlng was golng
really well.

485
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:39,509
Until...

486
00:37:40,416 --> 00:37:42,680
Until?

487
00:37:42,751 --> 00:37:45,185
Until something happened.

488
00:37:45,254 --> 00:37:49,281
By the time the miners finally
sent word back to their relatives,

489
00:37:49,358 --> 00:37:53,795
they described this place as a
mountain paradise with them as riches.

490
00:37:53,862 --> 00:37:57,229
Then instructed them all to sell
everything and come immediately.

491
00:37:57,299 --> 00:37:59,028
And so they did.

492
00:37:59,101 --> 00:38:01,160
When they arrived,

493
00:38:01,236 --> 00:38:03,261
they found all the miners

494
00:38:03,338 --> 00:38:07,434
and their families... dead.

495
00:38:07,509 --> 00:38:10,342
Women, children,

496
00:38:10,412 --> 00:38:13,575
everythlng, everyone
was slaughtered.

497
00:38:13,649 --> 00:38:16,174
Without a second thought,

498
00:38:16,251 --> 00:38:18,310
the settlers took their guns,

499
00:38:18,387 --> 00:38:21,754
went to the nearest tribe
and slaughtered everyone.

500
00:38:21,824 --> 00:38:23,655
That was a real massacre.

501
00:38:23,725 --> 00:38:27,491
Not some phony stories about Indians
killing white women and children.

502
00:38:27,563 --> 00:38:29,895
Yeah, I remember
hearing about this.

503
00:38:32,367 --> 00:38:34,164
If the Indians didn't do it,

504
00:38:34,236 --> 00:38:35,703
what did happen
to the settlers?

505
00:38:35,771 --> 00:38:38,763
The natives blamed the other
creature made this place home.

506
00:38:38,841 --> 00:38:40,206
Wait, wait.

507
00:38:40,275 --> 00:38:43,540
This is not one of those
stupid Bigfoot stories, is it?

508
00:38:43,612 --> 00:38:44,874
It's Taku He.

509
00:38:44,947 --> 00:38:47,074
What the hell
did you just say?

510
00:38:47,149 --> 00:38:50,118
The native peoples all over
the world have different names

511
00:38:50,185 --> 00:38:54,383
like Taku He, Sasquatch,
Yeti, Bigfoot,

512
00:38:54,456 --> 00:38:57,687
usually translated
to mean large man.

513
00:38:57,759 --> 00:39:00,489
Do they consider them
dangerous?

514
00:39:00,562 --> 00:39:02,462
I would imagine
they're like

515
00:39:02,531 --> 00:39:04,897
any other creature
in the wild.

516
00:39:04,967 --> 00:39:09,097
If they're put in a situation of danger,
they react with the fly or fight response,

517
00:39:09,171 --> 00:39:12,163
specially if you got
between mother and child.

518
00:39:12,241 --> 00:39:14,937
Do you think any of them
still llve here?

519
00:39:15,010 --> 00:39:16,841
I don't know,

520
00:39:16,912 --> 00:39:20,313
but the records of them dating back
all the way to the first explorers.

521
00:39:20,382 --> 00:39:22,748
All the way until a couple of years ago.

522
00:39:22,818 --> 00:39:24,183
Wild, screeching beasts

523
00:39:24,253 --> 00:39:26,244
who hunt for game
and fish.

524
00:39:26,321 --> 00:39:28,881
You can throw rods
and things.

525
00:39:28,957 --> 00:39:32,154
Okay, that's enough.
I do want to sleep tonight.

526
00:39:32,227 --> 00:39:35,128
No, I've seen all those
campy Bigfoot movies

527
00:39:35,197 --> 00:39:38,530
and they aren't scary.

528
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:41,000
Okay.
Well, then you know

529
00:39:41,069 --> 00:39:44,129
any woman on her menstrual cycle
should stay out of the woods.

530
00:39:44,206 --> 00:39:46,572
What?
Why?

531
00:39:46,642 --> 00:39:48,542
C'mon!
Use your imagination.

532
00:39:48,610 --> 00:39:51,374
Who wants a lady on the rag
with you when you're camping?

533
00:39:51,446 --> 00:39:53,676
Jay, shut up.

534
00:39:53,749 --> 00:39:57,549
Actually, it's because animals
can smell blood from miles.

535
00:39:57,619 --> 00:39:59,416
Okay, that's enough.

536
00:39:59,488 --> 00:40:03,015
I agree. Could we please
talk about something else?

537
00:40:03,091 --> 00:40:04,922
Anything else?

538
00:40:11,833 --> 00:40:14,802
Well, beer's kicking in.

539
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:17,566
Jesus!

540
00:40:19,441 --> 00:40:22,103
So, do you think it's,
you know,

541
00:40:22,177 --> 00:40:23,974
killed anyone recently?

542
00:40:24,046 --> 00:40:26,105
Jenny, stop.

543
00:40:26,181 --> 00:40:27,876
Has it?

544
00:40:27,950 --> 00:40:33,547
Well, there are records of a few
animals mutilated found hanging in trees.

545
00:40:33,622 --> 00:40:35,385
Trees?

546
00:40:35,457 --> 00:40:36,549
Trees.

547
00:40:36,625 --> 00:40:38,320
Is that why
you didn't wanna come?

548
00:40:38,393 --> 00:40:41,157
Okay, enough. Do not
answer that question.

549
00:40:44,866 --> 00:40:49,769
Oh, my God.
You guys. I saw it!

550
00:40:49,838 --> 00:40:53,001
I saw it over there,
in the night.

551
00:41:02,884 --> 00:41:05,944
You should've seen her!

552
00:41:09,124 --> 00:41:10,489
That wasn't funny!

553
00:41:10,559 --> 00:41:15,053
Jay?
You are such a jerk!

554
00:41:16,765 --> 00:41:19,165
Baby, c'mon!
It was just a joke.

555
00:41:23,438 --> 00:41:25,565
I'm sorry, Sherlff.

556
00:41:25,641 --> 00:41:27,438
When I took hls keys,
he got Ignorant

557
00:41:27,509 --> 00:41:29,067
and locked hlmself
in the head.

558
00:41:30,178 --> 00:41:32,476
How long
has he been in there?

559
00:41:32,547 --> 00:41:34,538
Over an hour.

560
00:41:35,884 --> 00:41:38,318
Ray!
Sheriff Kassel.

561
00:41:38,387 --> 00:41:41,185
You got me
this time, Sheriff.

562
00:41:41,256 --> 00:41:44,248
It's like
you got yourself there, Ray.

563
00:41:44,326 --> 00:41:46,760
Planning on coming out
any time soon?

564
00:41:46,828 --> 00:41:51,527
Are you planning on giving
me my keys back, huh?

565
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:53,124
So I can drive home?

566
00:41:53,201 --> 00:41:57,001
Why would I do
something like that, Ray?

567
00:41:57,072 --> 00:42:02,203
'Cause I got some information
and you don't know about.

568
00:42:08,784 --> 00:42:13,118
You didn't hear this
from me, okay?

569
00:42:14,189 --> 00:42:17,989
But Ed and the boys

570
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:23,327
are going back up in the
mountains to kill a bear.

571
00:42:23,398 --> 00:42:27,562
And they said they're
gonna kill Eagleheart, too.

572
00:42:27,636 --> 00:42:29,536
What?

573
00:42:29,604 --> 00:42:31,902
Eagleheart
saved his life.

574
00:42:33,075 --> 00:42:35,566
Ed doesn't think so.

575
00:42:37,179 --> 00:42:39,306
Ed thinks
that the Indian did it.

576
00:42:39,381 --> 00:42:41,815
Is he crazy?

577
00:42:43,085 --> 00:42:44,450
C'mon, let's go!

578
00:42:45,821 --> 00:42:47,482
C'mon I

579
00:42:50,058 --> 00:42:51,355
Good one!

580
00:42:51,426 --> 00:42:52,859
Try it again.

581
00:42:52,928 --> 00:42:55,396
No way.
No way.

582
00:42:55,464 --> 00:42:57,398
C'mon, you pansy.

583
00:42:57,466 --> 00:42:59,366
I burned my bottom
that last one.

584
00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:08,134
We're gonna need
another bottle.

585
00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:09,507
There's one
in the jeep.

586
00:43:09,578 --> 00:43:11,102
Who wants to go get it?

587
00:43:11,179 --> 00:43:13,340
I ain't going, man.

588
00:43:13,415 --> 00:43:15,576
You just got
the smartest.

589
00:43:15,650 --> 00:43:17,242
I'm not going up there
alone.

590
00:43:17,319 --> 00:43:19,310
I'm not going.

591
00:43:19,387 --> 00:43:21,821
I vote for Leo.

592
00:43:22,891 --> 00:43:24,882
Hey, I vote
for Leo, too.

593
00:43:27,229 --> 00:43:29,720
Looks like
it's you, my buddy.

594
00:43:30,699 --> 00:43:32,030
Bad.

595
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:34,432
You boys better hope I
don't get that jeep fired up

596
00:43:34,503 --> 00:43:37,233
'cause I might just
leave you here.

597
00:43:38,073 --> 00:43:39,836
Better take the gun.

598
00:43:39,908 --> 00:43:42,433
You might run
into a mad woodman out there.

599
00:43:50,418 --> 00:43:52,716
This sucks.

600
00:43:54,489 --> 00:43:56,582
To Leo!

601
00:43:56,658 --> 00:43:59,422
That's my cousin.

602
00:43:59,494 --> 00:44:00,961
And he's as dumb
as he looks.

603
00:44:01,029 --> 00:44:05,693
I hope that stupid bastard
doesn't' have to shoot anything.

604
00:44:05,767 --> 00:44:07,928
Why?

605
00:44:30,392 --> 00:44:32,792
Oh, there you are, girl.

606
00:44:59,621 --> 00:45:01,088
Tommy?

607
00:45:02,224 --> 00:45:05,193
Tommy, is that you?

608
00:45:05,260 --> 00:45:08,787
C'mon out of there. I
saw you already. Come on.

609
00:45:13,935 --> 00:45:15,402
Ed?

610
00:45:15,470 --> 00:45:17,768
Manny, quit screwing around!

611
00:45:20,775 --> 00:45:22,800
I will shoot you.

612
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:27,246
Alright.

613
00:45:27,315 --> 00:45:28,907
You wanna play with me?

614
00:46:23,538 --> 00:46:25,631
What the hell was that?

615
00:46:27,375 --> 00:46:29,240
Sounded like Leo.

616
00:46:29,311 --> 00:46:32,371
The damn fool probably
just saw his own shadow.

617
00:46:32,447 --> 00:46:33,573
Let's go.

618
00:46:33,648 --> 00:46:37,516
Are you kidding?
I ain't going out there!

619
00:46:37,585 --> 00:46:38,882
Let's go find him.

620
00:46:38,954 --> 00:46:41,047
Oh, hell,
let's all go.

621
00:46:41,122 --> 00:46:44,182
Grab your guns
and get a couple of lights.

622
00:46:46,328 --> 00:46:48,193
Are you cold? I can get some more wood.

623
00:46:48,263 --> 00:46:50,163
I'm fine.

624
00:47:02,978 --> 00:47:04,969
Thanks.

625
00:47:07,048 --> 00:47:09,949
You must do this a lot.

626
00:47:10,018 --> 00:47:13,283
Give a girl my jacket?
First time.

627
00:47:13,355 --> 00:47:15,755
Camping.

628
00:47:15,824 --> 00:47:18,292
You know,
whenever I need the space.

629
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:20,760
Yeah, well, I get
plenty of that at home.

630
00:47:28,636 --> 00:47:32,800
My dad's a consultant, and so
whenever he goes out of town a lot,

631
00:47:32,874 --> 00:47:34,865
my mom goes with him.

632
00:47:34,943 --> 00:47:37,605
And I get stuck
with Jay.

633
00:47:37,679 --> 00:47:39,579
Lucky for me, huh?

634
00:47:59,801 --> 00:48:01,735
Ooh!

635
00:48:01,803 --> 00:48:03,600
Jay, you really suck.
You know that?

636
00:48:03,671 --> 00:48:05,605
I'm your cousin!

637
00:48:06,875 --> 00:48:08,809
You know, Rich?
Let's go.

638
00:48:08,877 --> 00:48:12,278
I'm gonna tell your parents
when they get home.

639
00:48:13,581 --> 00:48:15,845
You two kids behave, alright?

640
00:48:20,488 --> 00:48:22,752
I wanna hear
your loud noises!

641
00:48:31,833 --> 00:48:34,165
Well, I guess
it's just you and me now.

642
00:48:34,235 --> 00:48:36,795
Jay, I'm sacred!

643
00:48:38,273 --> 00:48:39,297
What!

644
00:48:55,123 --> 00:48:56,351
Where's Leo?

645
00:48:56,424 --> 00:48:59,018
The dumb ass
left his lights on.

646
00:48:59,094 --> 00:49:01,119
Where is the whiskey?

647
00:49:04,299 --> 00:49:06,426
Where did it go?

648
00:49:07,368 --> 00:49:10,360
Whiskey!

649
00:49:10,438 --> 00:49:12,303
Now, where is Leo?

650
00:49:14,742 --> 00:49:16,403
Oh, my God.

651
00:49:16,478 --> 00:49:19,970
Oh, Jesus.

652
00:49:20,048 --> 00:49:21,640
Oh, my God!

653
00:49:22,917 --> 00:49:24,885
Cover him up!

654
00:49:24,953 --> 00:49:27,945
What kind of bear
could do something like this?

655
00:49:28,022 --> 00:49:29,649
We better
get back to camp.

656
00:49:29,724 --> 00:49:30,713
What about Leo?

657
00:49:30,792 --> 00:49:35,126
Leave him.
Leave him!

658
00:49:35,196 --> 00:49:37,664
He... he's right, Tom.

659
00:49:37,732 --> 00:49:41,224
I got a bad feeling here.
C'mon, let's go!

660
00:49:41,302 --> 00:49:44,703
C'mon, Tom. Let's go. Come on!

661
00:49:47,942 --> 00:49:50,433
I'm really scared.

662
00:49:50,512 --> 00:49:54,278
Scared of what?
What are you scared of?

663
00:49:54,349 --> 00:49:56,715
Of what Rich said.

664
00:49:56,784 --> 00:49:59,309
About animals and how
they can smell blood.

665
00:49:59,387 --> 00:50:02,845
Baby, that was just a story.
Really.

666
00:50:02,924 --> 00:50:06,917
So he made up that whole
story about the massacre?

667
00:50:06,995 --> 00:50:08,121
Yeah!

668
00:50:08,196 --> 00:50:11,324
Besides,
do you see those guns?

669
00:50:11,399 --> 00:50:14,732
Oh, yeah,
they'll protect you.

670
00:50:14,802 --> 00:50:16,429
I promise.

671
00:50:16,504 --> 00:50:20,338
There's nothing
to worry about, okay?

672
00:50:41,062 --> 00:50:42,654
Jay, knock it off.

673
00:50:46,634 --> 00:50:48,829
Hey, it isn't me!

674
00:50:48,903 --> 00:50:50,495
Well, who is it?

675
00:50:50,572 --> 00:50:52,540
How the hell
should I know?

676
00:51:03,685 --> 00:51:06,984
Throw another rock at my tent
and I'll throw you a beating.

677
00:51:07,055 --> 00:51:09,683
I thlnk you guys should
come over to our tent.

678
00:51:09,757 --> 00:51:12,317
Yeah, fat chance
of that happening.

679
00:51:12,393 --> 00:51:14,759
You guys come over here.

680
00:51:19,867 --> 00:51:22,495
Just try to get some sleep.

681
00:51:24,639 --> 00:51:27,506
Some sleep.
You can't be serious.

682
00:51:27,575 --> 00:51:29,907
Don't worry about it.

683
00:51:51,799 --> 00:51:53,198
Jay.

684
00:51:53,268 --> 00:51:55,361
Hey, Jay.
Jay.

685
00:51:55,436 --> 00:51:58,894
Jay, get up. I gotta
pee. You gotta come.

686
00:51:58,973 --> 00:52:01,407
Jay!

687
00:52:03,578 --> 00:52:05,637
Fine!

688
00:52:07,348 --> 00:52:10,511
Just cover myself, I guess.

689
00:53:24,592 --> 00:53:26,753
Jay, Jay!

690
00:53:33,034 --> 00:53:35,264
What? What?
Baby, what's wrong?

691
00:53:35,336 --> 00:53:40,103
Jay, I'm so sick
of your stupid pranks.

692
00:53:40,174 --> 00:53:43,632
What the hell did I do? I'm sleeping.

693
00:53:43,711 --> 00:53:46,179
Are you guys alrlght?

694
00:53:46,247 --> 00:53:48,408
Yeah, yeah.

695
00:53:48,483 --> 00:53:50,610
Everything's great.

696
00:54:00,395 --> 00:54:02,056
What!

697
00:54:02,130 --> 00:54:04,030
Fuck.
Jesus!

698
00:54:04,098 --> 00:54:07,693
What kind of project
are you making, Jay?

699
00:54:07,769 --> 00:54:10,499
Funny. Somebody's gotta
look after my cousin.

700
00:54:10,571 --> 00:54:13,369
Okay. Your cousin
can look after herself.

701
00:54:13,441 --> 00:54:15,500
Right!

702
00:54:15,576 --> 00:54:18,773
What do you little horn balls
say if we go find that bear, huh?

703
00:54:18,846 --> 00:54:21,314
And you plan
would be, what?

704
00:54:21,382 --> 00:54:25,182
Just go hike up the falls where
we heard the gunshots last night.

705
00:54:26,487 --> 00:54:28,785
Oh, yeah!
That's a good idea.

706
00:54:28,856 --> 00:54:32,189
I mean, you know, one in doubt
always head to a gun fire, right?

707
00:54:34,095 --> 00:54:36,529
Look, Jay, we have pictures
of the grizzly bear.

708
00:54:36,597 --> 00:54:38,292
So, how about
we just head back?

709
00:54:38,366 --> 00:54:41,233
Dude, no way. Vancamp said
I need an A to graduate.

710
00:54:41,302 --> 00:54:43,702
What you just said
was a C at best, alright?

711
00:54:43,771 --> 00:54:48,140
I need to get some live, hard
core, reality sound TV for this.

712
00:54:48,209 --> 00:54:49,699
Good morning.

713
00:54:49,777 --> 00:54:52,769
Okay, news washed.
Camping blows.

714
00:54:55,349 --> 00:54:59,649
And you, "Mr. I'm suddenly concerned
with my grades all of a sudden,"

715
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:03,383
we're leaving now, okay? Especially
if you ever would like to see me again.

716
00:55:03,458 --> 00:55:06,916
Jay, ten minutes, okay?
Bye.

717
00:55:11,999 --> 00:55:14,433
Hlgh camp to
to base one. Over.

718
00:55:16,604 --> 00:55:18,697
Hlgh camp
to base one. Over.

719
00:55:18,773 --> 00:55:19,933
Go ahead, John.

720
00:55:21,943 --> 00:55:24,207
Wish I had better news.

721
00:55:24,278 --> 00:55:27,042
Any sign of our problem?

722
00:55:27,114 --> 00:55:28,706
Not yet.

723
00:55:28,783 --> 00:55:31,217
Janzer and his boys
are up here,

724
00:55:31,285 --> 00:55:33,845
along with some kids, too.

725
00:55:33,921 --> 00:55:36,515
Llsten, you need
to watch yourself, John.

726
00:55:36,591 --> 00:55:38,650
I got a bad feeling
our friend Ed Janzer

727
00:55:38,726 --> 00:55:42,184
might try to make you look
like a hunting accident.

728
00:55:42,263 --> 00:55:44,231
Copy that.

729
00:55:44,298 --> 00:55:45,925
Give me another day.

730
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,696
If you don't hear from me,
come and look.

731
00:55:48,769 --> 00:55:51,465
Alright, but promise me
you'll stay away from Janzer.

732
00:55:51,539 --> 00:55:54,975
Don't do anything stupid. The last
thing we need is to have another...

733
00:55:57,411 --> 00:56:01,646
Sheriff?

734
00:56:31,546 --> 00:56:34,845
You tell me how we're supposed
to find that damn Indian.

735
00:56:34,916 --> 00:56:37,077
You let me
handle that.

736
00:56:37,151 --> 00:56:40,814
That son of a bitch is
probably watching us right now.

737
00:56:40,888 --> 00:56:43,413
I'm going back to Leo.

738
00:56:43,491 --> 00:56:46,983
You go back to Leo, you
might kiss your ass good bye.

739
00:56:47,061 --> 00:56:48,995
Now, let's head out!

740
00:56:49,063 --> 00:56:51,725
We never even covered him
last night.

741
00:56:51,799 --> 00:56:54,097
Stick with us, Tommy.

742
00:56:54,168 --> 00:56:56,363
It ain't right.

743
00:56:56,437 --> 00:56:58,405
Stick.

744
00:57:05,713 --> 00:57:08,181
This really sucks, you guys.
You know that?

745
00:57:08,249 --> 00:57:12,345
I'm going home and I'm not
graduating all at the same damn time!

746
00:57:12,420 --> 00:57:15,321
Look at the bright side. At
least we can use your homework.

747
00:57:15,389 --> 00:57:16,822
Who does homework?

748
00:57:16,891 --> 00:57:20,759
Jay, can we get the hell
out of here, now?

749
00:57:25,333 --> 00:57:27,767
Wait you guys.
Hang on a second.

750
00:57:34,442 --> 00:57:37,377
Hey, Mr. Vancamp.
Well, we've just got done

751
00:57:37,445 --> 00:57:40,209
spending five very long days
in the wilderness.

752
00:57:40,281 --> 00:57:43,682
And in all, I would say that
we've observed 40 or even...

753
00:57:43,751 --> 00:57:46,117
Richard, would you say 50
endangered species?

754
00:58:02,236 --> 00:58:05,103
Who in hell would do
something like that?

755
00:58:05,172 --> 00:58:07,732
Damn near tore
his face off.

756
00:58:07,808 --> 00:58:09,867
Somebody that wants
to send a message.

757
00:58:09,944 --> 00:58:12,412
I don't like
the feel in here.

758
00:58:13,681 --> 00:58:15,649
Let's keep moving.

759
00:58:24,625 --> 00:58:27,685
Hey, Rich,
I was wondering,

760
00:58:27,762 --> 00:58:32,358
you know, last night, were you
telling the truth about all that stuff?

761
00:58:32,433 --> 00:58:34,424
Yeah.

762
00:58:34,502 --> 00:58:36,800
Okay, wait.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

763
00:58:38,739 --> 00:58:43,972
So, you're saying
that Bigfoot is real

764
00:58:44,045 --> 00:58:46,605
and that that's
what killed those men?

765
00:58:52,553 --> 00:58:54,680
Rich.

766
00:58:54,755 --> 00:58:56,222
John.

767
00:58:56,290 --> 00:58:59,350
What are you doing here? You
guys really shouldn't be here.

768
00:58:59,427 --> 00:59:00,519
Why not?

769
00:59:02,930 --> 00:59:05,023
You all need
to leave here, now.

770
00:59:05,099 --> 00:59:08,227
And we should listen
to you because...

771
00:59:08,302 --> 00:59:13,399
Rich, can I talk with you
a moment in private?

772
00:59:16,010 --> 00:59:17,409
What the hell's going on?

773
00:59:17,478 --> 00:59:20,174
What's wrong?
Hey.

774
00:59:20,247 --> 00:59:22,943
Does anybody know
what they're talking about?

775
00:59:23,017 --> 00:59:25,679
We'll never
gonna get out of here.

776
00:59:25,753 --> 00:59:28,347
Oh, no, but look.
I think our boy scout

777
00:59:28,422 --> 00:59:32,222
Might be trying to get
his Indian badge.

778
00:59:32,293 --> 00:59:35,319
He said we should get
the hell out of here.

779
00:59:35,396 --> 00:59:36,863
Why?

780
00:59:36,931 --> 00:59:39,126
Those gunshots
we heard last night.

781
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:42,601
There's a group of hunters
that are shooting at everything.

782
00:59:42,670 --> 00:59:43,932
They might come after us.

783
00:59:44,004 --> 00:59:46,370
Come on! Why would they
do something like that?

784
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:47,873
What else
did he say?

785
00:59:47,942 --> 00:59:51,434
He said we should head
straight through the woods.

786
00:59:51,512 --> 00:59:54,743
We gotta get the message to
the Sheriff, alright? Come on!

787
00:59:55,549 --> 00:59:56,777
Whoa!

788
00:59:56,851 --> 00:59:59,149
Message?
What message?

789
01:00:00,287 --> 01:00:02,380
Hey, what message?

790
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:08,428
Hey, you!

791
01:00:11,398 --> 01:00:14,731
What the...
I don't believe this.

792
01:00:15,970 --> 01:00:17,995
The bastard
trashed the camp.

793
01:00:18,072 --> 01:00:21,906
You and your boys
need to leave here now.

794
01:00:21,976 --> 01:00:24,376
I will be leaving, alright?

795
01:00:24,445 --> 01:00:26,504
But after I finish
killing you.

796
01:00:26,580 --> 01:00:29,879
Ed says it's your fault
my cousin was killed.

797
01:00:34,455 --> 01:00:37,390
I had nothing to do with that.

798
01:00:37,458 --> 01:00:39,722
I don't think
Ed is telling you everything.

799
01:00:40,961 --> 01:00:43,953
You don't know what
you're messing with here.

800
01:00:44,031 --> 01:00:46,932
What do you think
did this to your camp?

801
01:00:47,001 --> 01:00:50,402
What do you think
killed Leo and the others?

802
01:00:50,471 --> 01:00:54,202
You should know enough about bears
to know they always cover their kill.

803
01:00:55,876 --> 01:00:59,368
He's right, Ed. I was wondering
about that the whole time.

804
01:00:59,446 --> 01:01:04,008
You have three seconds to explain
what the hell you're talking about.

805
01:01:04,084 --> 01:01:07,485
Or I'll put a bullet
in that blasted badge of yours.

806
01:01:09,890 --> 01:01:12,120
There's a creature out here

807
01:01:12,193 --> 01:01:14,388
and you managed
to piss it off pretty good.

808
01:01:14,461 --> 01:01:17,157
A creature.

809
01:01:17,231 --> 01:01:20,997
We may be dumb
by we ain't stupid, Chief.

810
01:01:21,068 --> 01:01:26,335
For the lack of better
word, yes, a creature.

811
01:01:26,407 --> 01:01:30,366
And whatever Ed was doing
up here two days ago,

812
01:01:30,444 --> 01:01:32,435
disturbed it.

813
01:01:32,513 --> 01:01:34,413
What did you do, Ed?

814
01:01:34,481 --> 01:01:35,948
Shoot at it?

815
01:01:36,016 --> 01:01:39,315
I should've shot you.

816
01:01:39,386 --> 01:01:42,412
Think what you want.

817
01:01:42,489 --> 01:01:45,424
But right now,
you need to leave here

818
01:01:45,492 --> 01:01:47,289
or it's gonna kill you all.

819
01:01:47,361 --> 01:01:50,387
Why won't this thing
kill you, huh?

820
01:01:50,464 --> 01:01:55,060
It will.
That's why I'm leaving.

821
01:01:55,135 --> 01:02:00,903
You crazy Indian. You ain't
going any place. Tie him up.

822
01:02:00,975 --> 01:02:02,135
Tie him up!

823
01:02:15,122 --> 01:02:16,749
Can I see the map?

824
01:02:19,393 --> 01:02:21,486
Do not tell me
we're lost.

825
01:02:21,562 --> 01:02:23,359
Just making sure
we don't get lost.

826
01:02:23,430 --> 01:02:26,194
I'm getting hungry.

827
01:02:26,267 --> 01:02:28,167
Alright, dick,
where do we go now?

828
01:02:28,235 --> 01:02:30,897
Uhm,

829
01:02:31,972 --> 01:02:33,371
I think we go
that way.

830
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:34,907
Hey, good.
Let's go.

831
01:02:34,975 --> 01:02:39,571
I'm not staying in this
forest another night.

832
01:02:39,647 --> 01:02:41,308
I'll get it.

833
01:02:47,121 --> 01:02:48,884
Are you good, buddy?

834
01:02:52,459 --> 01:02:55,860
Nobody's going anywhere.
We'll wait.

835
01:02:55,930 --> 01:02:58,160
We wait for what?

836
01:02:58,232 --> 01:03:00,291
Chief Eagleheart's monster.

837
01:03:00,367 --> 01:03:03,894
I don't believe in no
monster. Do you, Ed?

838
01:03:03,971 --> 01:03:05,905
What do you think,
numb nuts?

839
01:03:05,973 --> 01:03:08,669
Hell no, I don't believe in a monster.

840
01:03:08,742 --> 01:03:13,975
I know damn well there's a bear
up here. And he's gonna come back.

841
01:03:14,048 --> 01:03:17,279
Like the man said,

842
01:03:17,351 --> 01:03:22,084
my experience has told me is, bear
will not pass up a nice free meal.

843
01:03:24,124 --> 01:03:27,184
Boys, we got a lot
of red meat right here.

844
01:03:37,738 --> 01:03:40,206
Take the knife.

845
01:03:40,274 --> 01:03:42,799
Heat the blood up
in a fire.

846
01:03:42,876 --> 01:03:44,844
Take it up wind.

847
01:03:55,522 --> 01:03:58,889
I'm sorry, guys. This is
farther than I thought.

848
01:03:58,959 --> 01:04:01,621
We, uhm, have to make camp
here. It's getting dark.

849
01:04:02,896 --> 01:04:05,296
What about over there?

850
01:04:05,366 --> 01:04:06,663
By the tree?

851
01:04:06,734 --> 01:04:09,430
Good idea.
Let's check it out.

852
01:04:16,977 --> 01:04:18,239
It stinks.

853
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:21,307
It smells
like something died.

854
01:04:21,382 --> 01:04:23,714
Sure it does.

855
01:04:28,122 --> 01:04:30,613
Let me see.

856
01:04:30,691 --> 01:04:32,488
What the hell is that?

857
01:04:34,061 --> 01:04:37,087
Okay, this is sick.
What is that?

858
01:04:37,164 --> 01:04:39,632
We have to get the hell
out of here, man.

859
01:04:39,700 --> 01:04:41,759
What? Let me see,
let me see.

860
01:04:41,835 --> 01:04:43,860
C'mon!

861
01:04:43,937 --> 01:04:45,029
C'mon, man!

862
01:04:45,105 --> 01:04:47,005
I think it's moving.
It's moving.

863
01:04:51,979 --> 01:04:53,310
Get out of here!

864
01:05:04,691 --> 01:05:06,386
Jenny!

865
01:05:08,829 --> 01:05:10,456
Shea!

866
01:05:45,599 --> 01:05:47,499
Be very quiet, okay?
You got it?

867
01:05:47,568 --> 01:05:50,002
You got to get
yourself together.

868
01:05:50,904 --> 01:05:52,166
Sh.

869
01:05:59,646 --> 01:06:01,637
Jenny, it's gonna smell me.

870
01:06:02,883 --> 01:06:04,077
What?

871
01:06:04,151 --> 01:06:08,110
It's gonna smell me.
I've got my period.

872
01:06:09,423 --> 01:06:11,618
That's the least
of our problems, okay?

873
01:06:11,692 --> 01:06:14,752
We have to wait
for the guys.

874
01:06:14,828 --> 01:06:17,558
We're gonna die out here.
I know it, I know it.

875
01:06:17,631 --> 01:06:22,762
No, we're not
gonna die out there.

876
01:06:37,117 --> 01:06:39,551
Thought I told you
to tie him up.

877
01:06:49,663 --> 01:06:50,687
Did you hear that?

878
01:06:52,666 --> 01:06:55,294
Not like an animal
I've ever heard.

879
01:06:55,369 --> 01:06:57,064
And human neither.

880
01:06:57,137 --> 01:06:59,037
You both shut up
and listen.

881
01:07:00,040 --> 01:07:02,031
Manny, give me
my gun.

882
01:07:03,710 --> 01:07:04,836
What you're gonna do?

883
01:07:04,912 --> 01:07:08,040
I said just to pass it.

884
01:07:13,287 --> 01:07:14,515
Save your damn ammo.

885
01:07:16,423 --> 01:07:18,288
I ain't dying
like Leo.

886
01:07:21,428 --> 01:07:25,455
Where're you going?
Hey, Tom!

887
01:07:32,105 --> 01:07:33,436
Tom!

888
01:07:41,548 --> 01:07:42,913
Tom?

889
01:07:47,721 --> 01:07:50,246
I think I got something.

890
01:07:53,961 --> 01:07:56,521
Oh, my God.
No!

891
01:07:56,597 --> 01:07:58,861
Tom!
Tom.

892
01:08:00,334 --> 01:08:02,199
Stupid fool.

893
01:08:07,741 --> 01:08:10,869
You did this!
Huh?

894
01:08:10,944 --> 01:08:15,005
What are you gonna do?
You gonna kill me?

895
01:08:15,082 --> 01:08:17,516
I will, Ed. I will. You're the one.

896
01:08:19,353 --> 01:08:21,014
That disappoints me, Manny.

897
01:08:22,556 --> 01:08:24,046
All my friends are dead

898
01:08:25,492 --> 01:08:26,891
'cause of you.

899
01:08:28,128 --> 01:08:29,959
I'm your friend, Manny.

900
01:08:48,615 --> 01:08:49,980
I am your friend.

901
01:08:57,624 --> 01:08:59,785
Okay.

902
01:08:59,860 --> 01:09:03,125
I don't know what happened.
We all got chased by something.

903
01:09:03,196 --> 01:09:06,029
We all got split up.

904
01:09:06,099 --> 01:09:07,760
I don't know
what it was.

905
01:09:10,470 --> 01:09:13,837
Mr. Vancamp,
if you're watching this,

906
01:09:13,907 --> 01:09:16,569
we sure as hell better
get an A for this crap.

907
01:09:19,746 --> 01:09:22,214
I'm freezing.

908
01:09:34,661 --> 01:09:36,754
What are we gonna do?

909
01:09:37,898 --> 01:09:39,559
Just wait, I guess.

910
01:09:46,540 --> 01:09:48,508
Did you hear that?

911
01:09:51,311 --> 01:09:53,279
I can't,
I cannot...

912
01:09:53,347 --> 01:09:55,645
Shea, Shea,
don't go!

913
01:09:55,716 --> 01:09:57,274
Shea, don't run.

914
01:10:00,987 --> 01:10:03,251
Don't run.

915
01:10:37,758 --> 01:10:40,522
Base One to high camp.
Base One to high camp.

916
01:10:40,594 --> 01:10:44,860
C'mon, Johnny,
don't do this to me.

917
01:10:44,931 --> 01:10:46,455
Sheriff's office.

918
01:10:46,533 --> 01:10:48,728
I wanna know if that
grizzly's been killed.

919
01:10:48,802 --> 01:10:51,236
No, ma'am, the bear
hasn't been killed, yet.

920
01:10:51,304 --> 01:10:53,169
Get out there
and skin it.

921
01:10:53,240 --> 01:10:54,832
I sure will, ma'am.

922
01:10:54,908 --> 01:10:57,706
I'll do that
on my way to hell.

923
01:10:57,778 --> 01:11:00,008
Yes, ma'am.
You, too.

924
01:11:05,385 --> 01:11:06,977
I'll be right there.

925
01:11:08,121 --> 01:11:11,682
Kill the bear.
Kill the Mayor.

926
01:11:14,795 --> 01:11:17,992
Now, save the bear.
Kill the Mayor.

927
01:12:28,235 --> 01:12:30,100
Who the hell are you?

928
01:12:31,671 --> 01:12:34,640
Jenny Ackers. Thank God.
You've gotta help me.

929
01:12:34,708 --> 01:12:37,302
Can you please help me? I
don't know where I'm going.

930
01:12:37,377 --> 01:12:40,574
I'm lost. My friends are lost.
I don't know where they are.

931
01:12:40,647 --> 01:12:42,342
Please, help me.

932
01:12:44,651 --> 01:12:46,175
I'll help you.

933
01:12:49,556 --> 01:12:52,218
Shut up!

934
01:12:52,292 --> 01:12:55,420
Eagleheart!
Eagleheart!

935
01:12:55,495 --> 01:12:58,293
I'm gonna kill
this girl!

936
01:12:58,365 --> 01:13:00,299
Eagleheart I

937
01:13:18,118 --> 01:13:20,086
Eagleheart!

938
01:13:20,153 --> 01:13:23,088
I know you're around here.
I can smell you.

939
01:13:28,028 --> 01:13:30,189
Let her gol

940
01:13:35,068 --> 01:13:37,832
Let her go.

941
01:13:37,904 --> 01:13:40,338
You must think
I'm dumb as dirt.

942
01:13:42,509 --> 01:13:44,272
I'm the one you want.

943
01:13:45,912 --> 01:13:48,779
See, that's the difference
between you and me.

944
01:13:51,718 --> 01:13:54,619
I'm willing to kill
for what I believe in.

945
01:14:19,479 --> 01:14:21,037
Sheriff!

946
01:14:21,114 --> 01:14:22,479
Thank God.

947
01:14:22,549 --> 01:14:24,983
What the hell
is going on up here?

948
01:14:25,051 --> 01:14:28,043
We've got friends up there.
They're in trouble.

949
01:14:28,121 --> 01:14:31,420
You, come with me.
You, in the car.

950
01:14:31,491 --> 01:14:33,459
Here.
I'll take that.

951
01:14:34,894 --> 01:14:36,589
Get up!

952
01:14:39,933 --> 01:14:41,491
Stop!

953
01:14:41,568 --> 01:14:44,401
Are you gonna play
the hero now, kid?

954
01:14:48,942 --> 01:14:50,500
I know that gun.

955
01:14:50,577 --> 01:14:52,670
That's a nice gun,

956
01:14:52,746 --> 01:14:54,475
specially when it's loaded.

957
01:15:06,493 --> 01:15:08,688
Wait up!

958
01:15:21,808 --> 01:15:25,005
He'll be okay.
Are you okay?

959
01:15:37,957 --> 01:15:39,083
Are you guys alright?

960
01:15:39,159 --> 01:15:40,183
Yeah.

961
01:15:40,260 --> 01:15:41,818
Oh!

962
01:15:41,895 --> 01:15:44,261
What happened?
Is he gonna be alright?

963
01:15:44,330 --> 01:15:45,695
Yeah, he's good.

964
01:15:47,200 --> 01:15:49,794
You'll be okay.
Okay, John?

965
01:15:49,869 --> 01:15:52,565
Richard, Richard,

966
01:15:52,639 --> 01:15:56,075
tha... tha... tha...
that's not a bear.

967
01:16:09,055 --> 01:16:10,386
No way.

968
01:16:10,457 --> 01:16:12,584
Look at that.

969
01:16:12,659 --> 01:16:17,460
Oh, my God!
It's freaking huge.

970
01:16:19,099 --> 01:16:20,896
Where is everybody?

971
01:16:20,967 --> 01:16:23,561
Sheriff, over here!

972
01:16:26,406 --> 01:16:28,840
Where did he...
Where did he go?

973
01:16:47,894 --> 01:16:50,954
There's gotta be something
wrong with the TV, Mr. Vancamp.

974
01:16:51,030 --> 01:16:53,055
We've been watching
this tape all weekend.

975
01:16:53,133 --> 01:16:56,625
I had this incredible footage of
the grizzly bear. He was like that.

976
01:16:56,703 --> 01:16:59,433
Except if you're standing up
and he'll roar!

977
01:17:01,040 --> 01:17:02,166
Roaring?

978
01:17:02,242 --> 01:17:03,266
I'm serious.

979
01:17:03,343 --> 01:17:05,243
I'm sure you did, Jay.

980
01:17:05,311 --> 01:17:07,541
Big surprise
for all of us, huh?

981
01:17:07,614 --> 01:17:10,139
Lucky for you
Richard got some nice photos.

982
01:17:10,216 --> 01:17:13,583
Actually, uhm,
Jay took these.

983
01:17:13,653 --> 01:17:15,553
Jay took these?

984
01:17:15,622 --> 01:17:17,180
Yeah.
I did the research

985
01:17:17,257 --> 01:17:19,555
in the library, mostly.

986
01:17:19,626 --> 01:17:21,150
Let's see.

987
01:17:21,227 --> 01:17:23,787
These are good!

988
01:17:23,863 --> 01:17:26,297
Looks like you got
precariously close there.

989
01:17:27,801 --> 01:17:31,999
And this is
the killer bear, huh?

990
01:17:32,071 --> 01:17:36,838
I thought you understood
when I said in-depth.

991
01:17:36,910 --> 01:17:42,439
That I wanted something
a bit more... in-depth.

992
01:17:42,515 --> 01:17:45,040
What we have here is a
little thin, don't you think?

993
01:17:45,118 --> 01:17:48,485
No, I don't think. I don't understand
why every time I do a project,

994
01:17:48,555 --> 01:17:50,216
you gotta give me
so much sh...

995
01:17:50,290 --> 01:17:54,522
Excuse me, but I think if you look
at the research that we actually did

996
01:17:54,594 --> 01:18:00,760
in it's entirety, you'll see that we
went the extra mile, and that's him.

997
01:18:00,834 --> 01:18:07,262
Well, where might I find
this extravaganza.

998
01:18:07,340 --> 01:18:12,903
Well, it would be extravagantly
laid out in your extravagant office.

999
01:18:27,727 --> 01:18:30,389
Earlier today,
thls amateur vldeo

1000
01:18:30,463 --> 01:18:33,193
created qulte a stlr
amongst some local resldents.

1001
01:18:33,266 --> 01:18:37,464
A Pine Creek man claims this supposed
Bigfoot creature pictured here

1002
01:18:37,537 --> 01:18:40,529
was responsibie for the recent
deaths of several local men.

1003
01:18:40,607 --> 01:18:42,302
Family members
of the deceased

1004
01:18:42,375 --> 01:18:45,867
responded by calling the video
a sick joke.

1005
01:18:45,945 --> 01:18:48,311
Local experts have
deemed the tape a hoax,

1006
01:18:48,381 --> 01:18:52,442
denouncing the grainy footage is
nothing more than a man in a monkey suit.

1007
01:18:52,518 --> 01:18:55,214
The man behind the film,
Dennis Vancamp,

1008
01:18:55,288 --> 01:18:57,779
is a science teacher
at Pine Creek High School.

1009
01:18:57,857 --> 01:18:59,324
The Mayor had this to say.

1010
01:18:59,392 --> 01:19:05,228
I can't tell you
how ashamed I feel today.

1011
01:19:05,298 --> 01:19:07,266
I say, as a community,

1012
01:19:07,333 --> 01:19:13,135
we will not and cannot tolerate
such unacceptable forms of behavior

1013
01:19:13,206 --> 01:19:17,370
among those who serve as
role models for our children.

1014
01:19:17,443 --> 01:19:19,775
The truth must overcome.

1015
01:19:19,846 --> 01:19:22,246
Next up, Captain Jimbo

1016
01:19:22,35 --> 01:19:24,749
gives us his five-day
micro planet.

1017
01:19:34,127 --> 01:19:38,530
Sometimes,
in the deep woods

1018
01:19:38,598 --> 01:19:41,465
when the mountain is lone,

1019
01:19:41,534 --> 01:19:45,129
when the sun no longer
touches my face

1020
01:19:45,204 --> 01:19:48,230
and the creatures lay still,

1021
01:19:48,308 --> 01:19:53,075
I can feel in there
Taku He.

1022
01:19:55,715 --> 01:19:57,706
Taku He.

1023
01:20:01,821 --> 01:20:04,517
Taku He.

1024
01:20:10,363 --> 01:20:12,161
Taku He.
