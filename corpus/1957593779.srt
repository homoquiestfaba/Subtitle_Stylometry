1
00:00:01,371 --> 00:00:03,954
(gentle music)

2
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:15,050
- [Announcer] The following dramatization

3
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:16,800
is based on official documents,

4
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,523
personal interviews
and published accounts.

5
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:22,890
- [Radio Operator] Angel
Flight 8-6, Alpha Bravo,

6
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:26,435
you are clear to taxi
via Alpha for runway 2-6.

7
00:00:26,435 --> 00:00:28,580
- [Rick] Tower, 8-6 Alpha Bravo,

8
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:30,534
ready for takeoff on 2-6.

9
00:00:30,534 --> 00:00:32,531
Confirm my FR flight plan.

10
00:00:32,531 --> 00:00:33,364
- [Radio Operator] Alpha Bravo.

11
00:00:33,364 --> 00:00:37,090
Clear for takeoff on
2-6 (speaking faintly).

12
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:41,120
- Alpha Bravo, climbing on
runway heading for 7,000.

13
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:41,953
Good day, Sir.

14
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:44,730
I hope you're all tied down back there.

15
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:46,320
We got takeoff clearance.

16
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,050
- Brad, you can get that later.

17
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:50,660
- I got that, no problem.

18
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:53,410
(dramatic music)

19
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:04,480
I'll get to that later.

20
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,453
- All set, Chuck.

21
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,560
How 'bout you, you need a hand up there?

22
00:01:14,746 --> 00:01:19,746
(engine revving)
(inspirational music)

23
00:01:40,786 --> 00:01:43,898
- So, what are you doin' this weekend?

24
00:01:43,898 --> 00:01:47,780
- (chuckles) My son, Travis
is learning how to cook.

25
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:49,780
I'll let him handle the kitchen,

26
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:51,533
I'll make a fire, curl up with Bob.

27
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:56,338
- Well, wake me up when we get there.

28
00:01:56,338 --> 00:01:59,171
(music continues)

29
00:02:01,334 --> 00:02:04,167
(engine whirring)

30
00:02:10,837 --> 00:02:13,754
(wheels skidding)

31
00:02:19,406 --> 00:02:22,310
(siren wailing)

32
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:24,670
- Okay, hon, one more cough.

33
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:25,868
- [Woman] I know I
should've looked after here.

34
00:02:25,868 --> 00:02:26,935
(Sammy coughs)

35
00:02:26,935 --> 00:02:30,120
- And again.
(Sammy coughing)

36
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:33,030
Just to be on the safe side,
I'd like to do an x-ray.

37
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:34,554
- [Man] Why, what's the matter?

38
00:02:34,554 --> 00:02:35,387
- I'm not sure.
- Telephone call

39
00:02:35,387 --> 00:02:36,220
for Dr. Johnson.

40
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:37,053
- I need a closer look.
- Telephone call

41
00:02:37,053 --> 00:02:38,273
for Dr. Johnson.
- Let's go.

42
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:41,250
- Hey, come on, pumpkin.

43
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:43,130
Let's go see what you look
like on the inside, okay?

44
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:44,500
Come on (grunts).

45
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:45,590
Yeah.

46
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:48,640
- What's that?
- Pretty sure it's metal,

47
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,163
something she swallowed.

48
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:56,750
There's a non-surgical
procedure we can try

49
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:57,850
to get it outta there.

50
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:00,223
OR, please.

51
00:03:01,486 --> 00:03:06,486
(monitor beeping)
(nurses speaking faintly)

52
00:03:06,854 --> 00:03:08,771
- [Doctor] There we go.

53
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:13,082
Yeah.

54
00:03:13,082 --> 00:03:13,915
Wait.

55
00:03:15,025 --> 00:03:16,033
What's her blood pressure?

56
00:03:16,033 --> 00:03:17,521
- [Nurse] 140/95.

57
00:03:17,521 --> 00:03:19,630
(beeping increases)

58
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:20,580
- [Doctor] How's her heart rate?

59
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:21,426
- [Nurse] 99.

60
00:03:21,426 --> 00:03:24,241
(beeping increases)

61
00:03:24,241 --> 00:03:25,074
- [Doctor] What's her heart rate now?

62
00:03:25,074 --> 00:03:29,013
- [Nurse] 125, 129, 131, 139.

63
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,466
She's tachy-ing.

64
00:03:32,466 --> 00:03:33,299
140.

65
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,326
- [Doctor] She can't take it.

66
00:03:36,326 --> 00:03:39,000
(monitor beeping rapidly)

67
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,090
- We did a bronchoscopy, but
we were unable to remove it.

68
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:44,860
We can't operate here, it's too risky.

69
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:46,680
There's an infection that could spread

70
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,460
to the heart or the lungs.

71
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:49,690
We have to fly her immediately

72
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:51,730
to Children's Hospital in Denver.

73
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:54,983
I can't overstate this, her
condition is extremely serious.

74
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:58,180
- My wife's terrified of flying.

75
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:00,530
- [Doctor] A seven hour
drive is too dangerous.

76
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,330
- I'll fly with Sammy.

77
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:06,370
- I'll make the arrangements.

78
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:09,190
- You go with Mom and I'll meet you

79
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:10,817
at the hospital in Denver.

80
00:04:10,817 --> 00:04:15,817
(solemn music)
(Jack panting)

81
00:04:20,569 --> 00:04:21,470
(phone ringing)

82
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:22,637
- I'll get it.

83
00:04:24,781 --> 00:04:26,281
Bagshaw residence.

84
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:30,263
Okay, I'll be in in 20 minutes.

85
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,570
- [Travis] Who was that?

86
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:34,860
- Sorry, honey, I gotta go back to work.

87
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:35,693
Why don't you come with me?

88
00:04:35,693 --> 00:04:37,200
You can ride back with dad.

89
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,160
- [Travis] But you just got home.

90
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,640
- I have to go, we're flying a little girl

91
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,120
to Denver for surgery.

92
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,820
- Mom, there's a big storm comin' in.

93
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:45,933
- I know, we'll get out before it hits.

94
00:04:47,834 --> 00:04:50,113
Aw, Travis, what's the matter?

95
00:04:51,614 --> 00:04:56,300
- I just wish you weren't
flyin' Angel Flights anymore.

96
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:57,750
I mean, look at it out there.

97
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:00,573
- Hey, it's my job.

98
00:05:07,706 --> 00:05:10,956
I'll be back in time for your birthday.

99
00:05:12,128 --> 00:05:14,795
(siren wailing)

100
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:25,753
- Hey, good lookin'.

101
00:05:25,753 --> 00:05:27,190
- I gotta fly out to Denver,
a little girl is sick.

102
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:28,023
- Oh, terrific.

103
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,360
- Listen, take Travis home.

104
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,274
He's worried about me.

105
00:05:32,274 --> 00:05:34,914
- He's worried about you and
he's not worried about me?

106
00:05:34,914 --> 00:05:36,700
- (chuckles) He's worried about
you flying the chopper too,

107
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:37,533
but he won't admit it.

108
00:05:37,533 --> 00:05:38,870
- Yeah, we'll talk about
this when you get back.

109
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:39,703
You gotta hurry.

110
00:05:39,703 --> 00:05:40,626
- Okay.
- Love you.

111
00:05:40,626 --> 00:05:42,125
- Love you.

112
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:43,802
(upbeat rock music playing)

113
00:05:43,802 --> 00:05:46,635
(window whirring)

114
00:05:48,078 --> 00:05:49,950
- You're a tough guy aren't you, buddy?

115
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:51,250
Ready to do it, killer?

116
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:52,107
Come on.

117
00:05:52,107 --> 00:05:53,383
- Daddy, come with me, I'm scared.

118
00:05:53,383 --> 00:05:54,770
- Just do it by yourself.

119
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:55,603
There you go.
(horn honking)

120
00:05:55,603 --> 00:05:57,740
There you go, Justin,
that's it, bend your knees.

121
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:59,066
Piece of cake. Yeah!

122
00:05:59,066 --> 00:06:00,282
Oh!

123
00:06:00,282 --> 00:06:01,115
You okay there?

124
00:06:01,115 --> 00:06:02,850
- Hey, you guys.

125
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:04,550
What in the world's goin' on, huh?

126
00:06:05,482 --> 00:06:06,399
- You okay?

127
00:06:07,782 --> 00:06:08,846
- I'm okay, Daddy.

128
00:06:08,846 --> 00:06:11,880
- [Angie] You okay, sweetie?

129
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:12,862
- Gotta do it by himself.

130
00:06:12,862 --> 00:06:14,980
That's the only way
he's gonna learn, right?

131
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:16,330
- Honey, we need to talk.

132
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:18,366
I think that we should just put Justin

133
00:06:18,366 --> 00:06:20,143
in the church kindergarten.

134
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,130
- There's two things wrong with that.

135
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:26,397
It's at the church,
and it's at the church.

136
00:06:26,397 --> 00:06:27,650
(phone ringing)

137
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:28,483
- Yeah, well, I know.

138
00:06:28,483 --> 00:06:30,380
Well, all have Justin's friends go there.

139
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:32,280
I think that it would be good for him.

140
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:34,743
Brad?
- Angie,

141
00:06:34,743 --> 00:06:36,720
I gotta get the phone, I'm on the call.

142
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,770
- Can we please finish this conversation?

143
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,240
- Yeah, Brown here.

144
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,620
- Brad, Teresa.

145
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:44,490
You gotta come in.

146
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:46,650
- [Brad] Well, do I have
time to take a shower?

147
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:47,483
I've been-

148
00:06:47,483 --> 00:06:48,860
- [Teresa] No, the patient's
a two-year-old girl

149
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:50,400
with a fever of 105.

150
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,930
We're flyin' her to Denver.

151
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:53,289
- I'm on my way.

152
00:06:53,289 --> 00:06:54,510
(phone beeps)
(pensive music)

153
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:55,352
I gotta go.

154
00:06:55,352 --> 00:06:56,503
- (sighs) Great.

155
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,467
- Come here, buddy (grunts).

156
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:06,447
Your daddy's gotta go and take
a plane to Denver tonight.

157
00:07:06,447 --> 00:07:08,090
- Don't go, Daddy.

158
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:10,910
- See, there's a little
kid like you who's sick,

159
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:12,110
and we gotta try to save her life.

160
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:16,347
- This is the way that it
always is, you know that?

161
00:07:16,347 --> 00:07:17,700
- Angie, this is my job.

162
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:19,010
What do you expect?

163
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:23,433
- I expect you to give
Justin and I equal time.

164
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:26,693
Brad?

165
00:07:27,598 --> 00:07:28,681
- I gotta go.

166
00:07:31,662 --> 00:07:33,296
(Angie sighs)

167
00:07:33,296 --> 00:07:36,046
(pensive music)

168
00:07:38,683 --> 00:07:39,516
Hey, Maria.

169
00:07:39,516 --> 00:07:41,010
- [Maria] Hey, Brad, have a good one.

170
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:42,642
See you tomorrow.

171
00:07:42,642 --> 00:07:43,910
- [Teresa] We better move out.

172
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:44,743
- [Brad] How's she doin'?

173
00:07:44,743 --> 00:07:46,280
- Not so good.

174
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:48,530
We didn't have time to
make introductions before.

175
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:50,120
I'm Teresa Bagshaw.

176
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:50,953
I'll be the flight nurse.

177
00:07:50,953 --> 00:07:52,160
- I'm Jack Bahr.

178
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,450
- Brad Brown.

179
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:56,071
- My wife Patty and my mother Loretta.

180
00:07:56,071 --> 00:07:57,830
- Just kiss me, Mommy.

181
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:59,247
- Oh, sweetheart!

182
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:02,993
- I want Bow.

183
00:08:04,676 --> 00:08:05,509
- [Teresa] What's that?

184
00:08:05,509 --> 00:08:06,963
- That's what she calls her bear.

185
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:10,347
- Hey there, Bow.

186
00:08:11,843 --> 00:08:14,385
Gonna take good care of you too.

187
00:08:14,385 --> 00:08:17,052
(phone ringing)

188
00:08:18,005 --> 00:08:19,543
- Hey?
(Patty whimpers)

189
00:08:19,543 --> 00:08:21,423
Hey, everything's gonna
be all right, okay?

190
00:08:22,421 --> 00:08:24,133
I love you.

191
00:08:24,133 --> 00:08:25,420
- Okay, we're all set.

192
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:26,420
Let's get a move on.

193
00:08:27,401 --> 00:08:30,651
(man speaking faintly)

194
00:08:31,733 --> 00:08:32,566
Heading for Denver.

195
00:08:32,566 --> 00:08:34,601
I want you to keep an
eye on the stretcher.

196
00:08:34,601 --> 00:08:35,518
Be careful.

197
00:08:38,577 --> 00:08:39,744
Watch that IV.

198
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:41,730
- IV's fine.

199
00:08:42,928 --> 00:08:44,345
- And here we go.

200
00:08:48,156 --> 00:08:48,989
All right.

201
00:08:48,989 --> 00:08:51,656
(siren wailing)

202
00:09:05,351 --> 00:09:08,184
(EMTs chattering)

203
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,423
- I got the right.
- All right.

204
00:09:19,262 --> 00:09:20,615
- [Teresa] Look her over.

205
00:09:20,615 --> 00:09:24,615
- And one, two, three (grunts).

206
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,233
- [Teresa] Put her down.

207
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:28,371
How's the IV?

208
00:09:28,371 --> 00:09:29,974
Good.

209
00:09:29,974 --> 00:09:31,057
Put her down.

210
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:34,086
- Goin' down.
- Bring it down.

211
00:09:34,086 --> 00:09:35,507
- One, two, three, go.

212
00:09:35,507 --> 00:09:38,090
(somber music)

213
00:09:42,398 --> 00:09:45,231
(engine whirring)

214
00:09:46,811 --> 00:09:48,228
- Jack, let's go.

215
00:09:50,619 --> 00:09:53,334
- Yo, Brad, how you doin'?

216
00:09:53,334 --> 00:09:55,980
- How you doin', Rick?

217
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:56,900
Jack, this is Rick.

218
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:57,860
He's our pilot.

219
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:00,060
Rick, this is Jack Bahr,
he's the patient's father.

220
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:00,893
- Welcome aboard.

221
00:10:00,893 --> 00:10:01,964
- Thanks.
- Jack, come over,

222
00:10:01,964 --> 00:10:03,550
sit over here.

223
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:04,383
Hey, buddy.

224
00:10:05,359 --> 00:10:07,203
- Hey, what'd you do, break your razor?

225
00:10:07,203 --> 00:10:09,106
(Rick chuckles)

226
00:10:09,106 --> 00:10:11,140
(engine whirring)

227
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:12,720
- [Teresa] I'm gonna do this real quick.

228
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,620
Gosh, you're good.

229
00:10:15,651 --> 00:10:16,883
Is that bothering you?

230
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,090
I'll make it more comfy.

231
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:20,490
That okay now?

232
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:22,150
- Mrs. Bagshaw?

233
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:23,280
- Teresa.

234
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,950
- Shouldn't be in some sort
of infant seat or something?

235
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:27,250
- She's strapped in tight.

236
00:10:28,431 --> 00:10:30,670
- Alpha, IFR flight to Denver.

237
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:32,647
I have information landing.

238
00:10:32,647 --> 00:10:35,050
- [Tower Control] Air
ambulance 8-6, Delta Bravo.

239
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:38,570
You are clear to taxi on
IFR flight, gray junction.

240
00:10:39,815 --> 00:10:43,898
- [Rick] Alpha Bravo, I'll
make sure, no problem.

241
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:46,570
- This is an air ambulance.

242
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:48,850
It's equipped for any
kind of medical emergency.

243
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:51,140
Got antibiotics, oxygen,

244
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:53,219
medical instruments, supplies.

245
00:10:53,219 --> 00:10:54,510
(Jack exhales)

246
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:55,343
- [Jack] Thanks.

247
00:10:55,343 --> 00:10:56,840
- Relax, Jack.

248
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,347
We'll be in Denver before you know it.

249
00:10:58,347 --> 00:11:01,264
(engine whirring)

250
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:07,420
- What's that on the window?

251
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:09,493
- I'd say it's ice.

252
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:13,557
- Can the plane take off with ice on it?

253
00:11:13,557 --> 00:11:15,750
- (chuckles) Look, you're
gonna have to chill out, okay?

254
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,030
It's no problem.

255
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:19,875
- [Rick] 8-6 Alpha Bravo,
ready for takeoff on 2-6.

256
00:11:19,875 --> 00:11:21,523

00:11:22,395 --> 00:11:26,562

- Alpha Bravo,

260
00:11:29,662 --> 00:11:33,267
climbing on runway
heading 2-6 to flight 101.

261
00:11:33,267 --> 00:11:34,455
Here we go.

262
00:11:34,455 --> 00:11:35,801
- [Brad] Yes, Sir.

263
00:11:35,801 --> 00:11:40,801
(engine whirring)
(exciting music)

264
00:12:31,028 --> 00:12:33,861

(singer vocalizing)
(music continues)

266
00:13:11,623 --> 00:13:12,456
- See?

267
00:13:13,808 --> 00:13:15,927
Smooth as silk, huh?

268
00:13:15,927 --> 00:13:17,164
Best job, Rick.

269
00:13:17,164 --> 00:13:22,164
(monitor beeping)
(engine whirring)

270
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:31,520
- I'm just gonna check your heart.

271
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,567
Okay, honey?

272
00:13:32,567 --> 00:13:37,567
(monitor beeping)
(engine whirring)

273
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:50,465
Hey Rick, do me a favor,
call ahead to the hospital,

274
00:13:50,465 --> 00:13:51,870
give 'em our ETA.

275
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:54,553
- Sure, Teresa, I'll have
Jefferson Center relay the info.

276
00:13:55,754 --> 00:13:57,723
- Jefferson Center, 8-6 Alpha Bravo.

277
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,587
- So, what do you do for a living?

278
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:04,510
- I'm the youth minister at my church.

279
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:06,743
- Great.

280
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:09,400
- What's a matter?

281
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,757
You got a problem with God?

282
00:14:10,757 --> 00:14:12,017
- No, let's just say that him

283
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:14,117
and I have never been the best of friends.

284
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:17,193
- Well, I'm sure he won't
hold it against you.

285
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:20,323
- Well, if you don't mind,

286
00:14:20,323 --> 00:14:22,050
I'm gonna get a couple
minutes of shut eye.

287
00:14:22,050 --> 00:14:23,300
I've been skiing all day.

288
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:26,430
- Skiing?

289
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:27,633
Skiing, and a paramedic.

290
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:29,763
Thrills and spills.

291
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:33,921
- I'm a ski patrol and I save lives, okay?

292
00:14:33,921 --> 00:14:36,754
(monitor beeping)

293
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:41,250
- [Teresa] Here, give me your hand.

294
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:42,740
I'm just gonna check on thing.

295
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:44,223
Do you know what this is?

296
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:46,307
This is gonna check and see...

297
00:14:46,307 --> 00:14:49,205
(heart monitor beeping)

298
00:14:49,205 --> 00:14:51,670
(alarm beeping)

299
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:52,503
- What's the matter?

300
00:14:52,503 --> 00:14:53,336
What's wrong?

301
00:14:53,336 --> 00:14:55,150
- The sound of the engine
lulls 'em to sleep every time.

302
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:56,700
Don't worry, it's good for her.

303
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:05,023
- Hey, its' my kid.

304
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:11,330
- You're right, I was outta line.

305
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:12,730
I'm sorry, Preacher Man.

306
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:14,901
- Don't call me Preacher Man.

307
00:15:14,901 --> 00:15:19,901
(gentle music)
(engine whirring)

308
00:15:29,993 --> 00:15:32,660
(pensive music)

309
00:15:53,991 --> 00:15:56,491
(engine revs)

310
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:02,735
- Hessman Tower, paging Alpha Bravo.

311
00:16:02,735 --> 00:16:05,109
- [Tower Control] Alpha Bravo, go ahead.

312
00:16:05,109 --> 00:16:07,009
- Got a bit of an engine problem here.

313
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:11,020
Requesting a vector back
into Grand Junction.

314

Bravo, paging in one 3,000.

00:16:15,511 --> 00:16:18,178
(pensive music)

317
00:16:19,135 --> 00:16:20,870
- Hey, what's the matter?

318
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:23,050
- We've got a bit of engine trouble.

319
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:24,443
- Is it serious?

320
00:16:24,443 --> 00:16:25,276
- Well, it's serious enough

321
00:16:25,276 --> 00:16:26,706
to go back down and check it out.

322
00:16:26,706 --> 00:16:29,123
(Brad sighs)

323
00:16:31,014 --> 00:16:31,847
- It's pretty bad out there,

324
00:16:31,847 --> 00:16:32,723
isn't it?
- Brad?

325
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:35,921
Don't bother him now.

326
00:16:35,921 --> 00:16:40,921
(engine whirring)
(pensive music)

327
00:16:44,755 --> 00:16:45,588
- What's goin' on?

328
00:16:45,588 --> 00:16:47,070
- We gotta go back.

329
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:48,050
We got engine trouble.

330
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:49,120
We gotta go back to Grand Junction.

331
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,040
- Go back? We can't go back.

332
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:50,940
What about Sammy?

333
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:51,799
- Put her on another plane

334
00:16:51,799 --> 00:16:53,650
as soon as they can get one prepped.

335
00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:55,550
- [Jack] No, no, no, no,
there's not enough time!

336
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:57,570
- [Teresa] Jack, we can't
go on with only one engine.

337
00:16:57,570 --> 00:16:58,407
We'll do what we can.

338
00:16:58,407 --> 00:17:03,407
(engine whirring)
(dramatic music)

339
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:07,192

climb and maintain 1,400

341
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:29,310
for a minimum IFR altitude en route.

342
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:31,500
- Sir, I don't think we're gonna

343
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,910
be able to climb to 1,400 feet.

344
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:35,513
Can I make it through low?

345
00:17:35,513 --> 00:17:37,699
- [Tower Control] Alpha Bravo, standby.

346
00:17:37,699 --> 00:17:40,822

- [Tower Control] November 8/6 Alpha Bravo

349
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:45,980
has a situation developing
with his right engine.

350
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:48,345
He's unable to maintain
IFR minimum approach

351
00:17:48,345 --> 00:17:50,060
for Grand Junction.

352
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:51,830
- Is he going to Grand Junction

353
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:53,370
or is he going to Rifle?

354
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:55,420
- [Tower Control] He's
going to Grand Junction.

355
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:56,391
- Copy that.

356
00:17:56,391 --> 00:17:58,973
(air traffic controllers chattering)

357
00:17:58,973 --> 00:18:01,806

358
00:18:03,489 --> 00:18:05,420
(monitor beeping)

359
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:07,820
- I'm getting everything
tied down just in case.

360
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:12,010
- Everything?
- Yes, everything, right now.

361
00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:13,200
Tell Rick to call ahead and make sure

362
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,240
another aircraft is ready
as soon as we're down.

363
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,450
- Rick, Rick, we got-

364
00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:18,753
- Brad! Sit down.

365
00:18:20,137 --> 00:18:22,970
(engine whirring)

366
00:18:28,937 --> 00:18:33,186
- (sighs) I feel like the whole
world's against me tonight.

367
00:18:33,186 --> 00:18:34,386
(Patty sighs)

368
00:18:34,386 --> 00:18:35,773
I just wish I was with her.

369
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:39,260
- They should be in Denver

370
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:41,790
by the time we get to Glenwood Springs.

371
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:43,908
- Jack will call home as soon as he can.

372
00:18:43,908 --> 00:18:45,863
- Come on, come on.

373
00:18:47,852 --> 00:18:49,150
- Let's stop and get a cup of coffee,

374
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:50,209
make sure he has.

375
00:18:50,209 --> 00:18:51,510
(Patty exhales)

376
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:53,553
- It's gonna be okay, sweetheart.

377
00:18:57,873 --> 00:18:58,706
- Okay.

378
00:18:59,758 --> 00:19:02,425
(pensive music)

379
00:19:19,305 --> 00:19:22,138

380
00:19:46,197 --> 00:19:50,614
(air traffic controllers chattering)

381
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:54,241
- What's Rifle got for weather?

382
00:19:54,241 --> 00:19:58,023
(keyboard keys clacking)

383
00:19:58,023 --> 00:19:59,327
(indistinct)

384
00:19:59,327 --> 00:20:03,650
- They're reporting 10 tenths
cloud cover as of 0200 Zulu.

385
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:05,813
- They'll never make it
out on the one engine.

386
00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:08,330
- What, think we should warn him off?

387
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:09,630
- Where to?

388
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:11,763
The guy's got zero options.

389
00:20:11,763 --> 00:20:16,763
(pensive music)
(engine whirring)

390
00:20:22,316 --> 00:20:23,200
- [Teresa] Sit down, Jack.

391
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,210
Jack, sit down.
- Sit down!

392
00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:25,540
- Jack, you're gonna have to sit down.

393
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:26,763
Put your seatbelt on!
- Guys, sit down!

394

(engine whirring)
(dramatic music)

397
00:20:46,174 --> 00:20:47,688
- Oh man we're low!

398
00:20:47,688 --> 00:20:52,688
(engine whirring)
(dramatic music)

399
00:21:01,743 --> 00:21:02,576
- Come on!

400
00:21:03,751 --> 00:21:04,953
Come on!

401
00:21:04,953 --> 00:21:09,953
(dramatic music)
(engine whirring)

402
00:21:17,279 --> 00:21:19,750
- Hessman Tower, mayday, mayday, mayday!

403
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:21,390
This is 8-6 Alpha Bravo,

404
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:23,987
8-6 Alpha Bravo, 8-6 Alpha Bravo!

405
00:21:23,987 --> 00:21:26,774
(engine whirring)

406
00:21:26,774 --> 00:21:28,595
- Rick, we're going into the storm!

407
00:21:28,595 --> 00:21:29,428
- Stop it!

408
00:21:30,438 --> 00:21:31,895
- What's happening?

409
00:21:31,895 --> 00:21:36,895
(dramatic music)
(engine whirring)

410
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:52,103
Rick, we're losing speed.

411
00:21:53,331 --> 00:21:55,202
Need more speed, Rick!

412
00:21:55,202 --> 00:21:56,035
- Shut up, Brad.

413
00:21:56,035 --> 00:21:56,868
He's flying it.

414
00:21:56,868 --> 00:21:59,075
- [Tower Control] 8-6
Alpha Bravo, revisions.

415
00:21:59,075 --> 00:22:00,317
6-8 Alpha Bravo?

416
00:22:00,317 --> 00:22:05,317
(engine whirring)
(dramatic music)

417
00:22:06,287 --> 00:22:07,366
- Well, folks, it looks like

418
00:22:07,366 --> 00:22:10,006
I'm gonna have to set this thing down.

419
00:22:10,006 --> 00:22:13,290
I want you to get everything
tied back down there, okay?

420
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:14,123
- Oh my God!

421
00:22:14,123 --> 00:22:18,964
(engine whirring)
(dramatic music)

422
00:22:26,339 --> 00:22:29,164
- A place, give me a place.

423
00:22:29,164 --> 00:22:30,809
- Hey, her bed's loose.

424
00:22:30,809 --> 00:22:32,277
Is she gonna be all right?

425
00:22:32,277 --> 00:22:36,027
- Well, she's strapped
in, she's strapped in.

426
00:22:37,008 --> 00:22:39,030
- [Jack] Sammy!

427
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:42,968
- A place, give me a
place, give me a place!

428
00:22:42,968 --> 00:22:43,968
Give me a...

429
00:22:45,299 --> 00:22:46,153
Got it!

430
00:22:46,153 --> 00:22:48,270
Hessman Tower, I am going in

431
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:49,956
for an emergency landing in a hurry.

432
00:22:49,956 --> 00:22:50,789
Do somethin'.

433
00:22:50,789 --> 00:22:53,789
(suspenseful music)

434
00:22:57,965 --> 00:22:58,955
- We're gonna crash!

435
00:22:58,955 --> 00:22:59,830
Lean forward!

436
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:01,130
- You said chill out!

437
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:02,203
- Jack, lean forward!

438
00:23:02,203 --> 00:23:04,953
(dramatic music)

439
00:23:08,437 --> 00:23:11,187
(plane rattling)

440
00:23:13,589 --> 00:23:14,653
(Rick yells)

441
00:23:14,653 --> 00:23:17,403
(plane crashing)

442
00:23:20,637 --> 00:23:22,949
(Teresa groans)

443
00:23:22,949 --> 00:23:25,699

448
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:19,260

November 8-6 Alpha Bravo?

00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:26,193
8-6 Alpha Bravo?

452
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,750
He's gone.

453
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:29,583
We've lost him.

454
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:32,920
- Advise Search & Rescue.

455
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:35,411

(Teresa inhales sharply)

466
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:00,083

467
00:26:03,777 --> 00:26:06,610
(Teresa groaning)

468
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:08,570
Anybody hurt (groans)?

483
00:26:50,071 --> 00:26:51,883
Sammy, Sammy?

484
00:26:52,770 --> 00:26:53,603
How is she?

485
00:26:55,293 --> 00:26:56,143
Is she all right?

486
00:26:59,995 --> 00:27:03,430
Oh, baby (panting).

487
00:27:03,430 --> 00:27:04,263
Tell me.

488
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:08,493
Tell me.

489
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:11,970
- She's breathing, she's got a pulse.

490
00:27:13,897 --> 00:27:17,039
I think she's okay.
(Jack exhales)

491
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:18,227

Oh, thank God.

497
00:27:28,757 --> 00:27:29,590
I'm...

498
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:35,640
I'm bleeding badly.

499
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:36,473
My head.

500
00:27:36,473 --> 00:27:37,637

501
00:27:37,637 --> 00:27:39,714
All right.

504
00:27:43,447 --> 00:27:46,573
- My ribs hurt like hell but I'm here.

505
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,850
How you doin'?

506
00:27:48,850 --> 00:27:50,277
Teresa (coughs)?

00:27:50,277 --> 00:27:52,530
(Teresa gasps)

508
00:27:52,530 --> 00:27:53,363
How 'bout you?

509
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:55,893

510
00:27:55,893 --> 00:27:58,424
(eerie music)

511
00:28:02,294 --> 00:28:03,127
I'm okay.

512
00:28:08,586 --> 00:28:10,381
You gonna check on Rick?

513
00:28:10,381 --> 00:28:13,214
- Yeah (panting).

514
00:28:14,477 --> 00:28:16,490

(Jack grunts)
(pensive music)

518
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,590
Come on, buddy, talk to me.

519
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:27,180
I can't hear him.

520
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:29,463
I can't see him.

521
00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:33,583
There's too much stuff blocking here.

522
00:28:33,583 --> 00:28:34,863
We got a mess.

523
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:38,350
- What's that smell?

524
00:28:40,871 --> 00:28:42,210
(Jack sniffs)

525
00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:43,983
- We're drenched in aviation fuel.

526
00:28:44,910 --> 00:28:47,659
We gotta get outside,
see if there's a fire.

527
00:28:47,659 --> 00:28:50,492
(Teresa grunting)

528
00:28:51,401 --> 00:28:52,553
It's jammed!

529
00:28:52,553 --> 00:28:57,553
(pensive music)
(wind whistling)

530
00:29:06,663 --> 00:29:07,496

531
00:29:14,841 --> 00:29:16,200
Rick?

532
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,033
Rick?

00:29:17,033 --> 00:29:19,390
(Rick groaning)

534
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:21,033
Rick, talk to me.

535
00:29:21,033 --> 00:29:22,299
(Rick coughing)

536
00:29:22,299 --> 00:29:26,966

(Rick coughing)

539
00:29:30,044 --> 00:29:31,544
Okay, I'll only be one second.

540
00:29:32,477 --> 00:29:33,310
- Oh, God.

541
00:29:34,575 --> 00:29:36,957
Oh, God (groaning).

542
00:29:36,957 --> 00:29:39,540
(Brad panting)

543
00:29:43,727 --> 00:29:44,560
- Brad?

544
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:45,393
- [Brad] Yeah?

545
00:29:45,393 --> 00:29:47,168
- [Teresa] Brad?

546
00:29:47,168 --> 00:29:48,001
- [Brad] I'm checking the radio

547
00:29:48,001 --> 00:29:49,971
to see if there's any power up here.

548
00:29:49,971 --> 00:29:51,891
(Brad groaning)

549
00:29:51,891 --> 00:29:53,141
- [Jack] Sammy!

550
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:55,493
- [Brad] The radio's dead.

551
00:29:57,350 --> 00:29:58,183
Come on.

552
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:00,303
Come on.

553
00:30:00,303 --> 00:30:02,864
(Rick gasping)

554
00:30:07,273 --> 00:30:09,036
How you doin'?

555
00:30:09,036 --> 00:30:10,023
Okay.

556
00:30:10,023 --> 00:30:11,937
I need your help, okay, buddy?

557
00:30:11,937 --> 00:30:13,107
I'm gonna take you back.

558
00:30:13,107 --> 00:30:13,940
All right.

559
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:16,523
(all grunting)

560
00:30:17,733 --> 00:30:18,996
Okay.

561
00:30:18,996 --> 00:30:20,276
Okay.

562
00:30:20,276 --> 00:30:21,474
Okay.

563
00:30:21,474 --> 00:30:23,077
Okay.

564
00:30:23,077 --> 00:30:24,724
Okay.

565
00:30:24,724 --> 00:30:29,724
(engine rumbling)
(radio playing)

566
00:30:40,730 --> 00:30:41,799
- I'm gonna call Dad.

567
00:30:41,799 --> 00:30:43,449
- Go ahead, I'll get some coffee.

568
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:46,430
Officer, is the pass clear up ahead?

569
00:30:46,430 --> 00:30:47,890
- Yes, Ma'am, so far anyway.

570
00:30:47,890 --> 00:30:49,950
Snow's accumulatin' up from the pass,

571
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:50,900
so we're advising anybody

572
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:53,700
who doesn't have to be
on the road to stay home.

573
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:55,367
- Hi, Dad, it's Patty.

574
00:30:55,367 --> 00:30:56,770
We're in Glenwood Springs.

575
00:30:56,770 --> 00:30:57,633
Has Jack called?

576
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:00,733
Are you sure?

577
00:31:00,733 --> 00:31:01,831
Have you been home the whole time?

578
00:31:01,831 --> 00:31:04,342
(pensive music)

579
00:31:04,342 --> 00:31:05,570
Okay.

580
00:31:05,570 --> 00:31:06,470
Okay, thanks, Dad.

581
00:31:07,554 --> 00:31:12,554
(receiver clattering)
(music continues)

582
00:31:15,719 --> 00:31:17,000
- What's the matter?

583
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,050
- Jack hasn't called.

584
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:21,735
Something's wrong, I can feel it.

585
00:31:21,735 --> 00:31:24,214
- Well now, maybe he
hasn't had his chance.

586
00:31:24,214 --> 00:31:25,226
- [Patty] I hope you're right.

587
00:31:25,226 --> 00:31:27,893
(pensive music)

588
00:31:33,533 --> 00:31:34,974
- All right.
- Back here.

589
00:31:34,974 --> 00:31:35,807
- Okay.

590
00:31:35,807 --> 00:31:38,474
(pensive music)

591
00:31:46,365 --> 00:31:48,699
(Rick panting)

592
00:31:48,699 --> 00:31:50,073
- Mayday, mayday, mayday, mayday!

593
00:31:50,073 --> 00:31:52,387
- [Teresa] Rick, relax.

594
00:31:52,387 --> 00:31:54,450
You're okay, relax.

595
00:31:54,450 --> 00:31:55,452
- [Brad] He's disoriented.

596
00:31:55,452 --> 00:31:56,640
- [Teresa] Try to keep him warm.

597
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:57,807
- [Brad] Okay.

598
00:31:59,387 --> 00:32:03,107
- [Teresa] Jack, can you hold this?

599
00:32:03,107 --> 00:32:04,357
- [Brad] I'm here, buddy.

600
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,790
How's she doin'?

601
00:32:07,790 --> 00:32:10,017
- I took the IV out of her
to try to keep (indistinct).

602
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:12,607
- Let me see that head.

603
00:32:15,710 --> 00:32:17,532
- It's bad isn't it?

604
00:32:17,532 --> 00:32:19,063
- It's just a scratch.

605
00:32:19,063 --> 00:32:19,896
Gauze.

606
00:32:22,010 --> 00:32:23,110
- My shoulder, it's...

607
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:25,933
- Let me see.

608
00:32:25,933 --> 00:32:27,463
- She's cold.

609
00:32:27,463 --> 00:32:29,225
Sammy's cold.

610
00:32:29,225 --> 00:32:30,133
(Brad groaning)

611
00:32:30,133 --> 00:32:32,050
- All right, all right.

612
00:32:33,270 --> 00:32:35,800
I think you may have a shoulder fracture.

613
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:36,676
You should try to keep it immobile

614
00:32:36,676 --> 00:32:37,920
as much as possible.

615
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:40,020
Maybe Brad can make a sling for you later.

616
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:45,740
Can you hold onto Sammy
a little while longer?

617
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:47,440
- I can hold her no matter what.

618
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,560
- [Brad] How's she doin'?

619
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:49,393
- [Teresa] Rick?

620
00:32:50,350 --> 00:32:52,348
Rick?
- She's cold.

621
00:32:52,348 --> 00:32:53,248
- Can you hear me?

622
00:32:54,672 --> 00:32:56,488
- I'm so sick.

623
00:32:56,488 --> 00:32:57,321
- Okay.

624
00:32:57,321 --> 00:33:01,488
- My stomach, I just feel
like I'm gonna throw up.

625
00:33:03,404 --> 00:33:05,368
- It's all right.

626
00:33:05,368 --> 00:33:07,580
Here you go.
- I'm gonna be sick.

627
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:08,430
- How's that ear?

628
00:33:09,476 --> 00:33:10,672
- I don't know.

629
00:33:10,672 --> 00:33:11,505
- Okay.

630
00:33:19,612 --> 00:33:21,200
So what do you think?

631
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,760
- Not too good.

632
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:25,626
He has all the symbols
of a serious head injury.

633
00:33:25,626 --> 00:33:28,180
And there's not much we can do about it.

634
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:30,180
If we don't get outta here quick,

635
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:33,512
he's not gonna make it.

636
00:33:33,512 --> 00:33:34,613
And neither is she.

637
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:39,300
Jack?

638
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:41,072
Let's get Sammy to lay down.

639
00:33:41,072 --> 00:33:42,279
I wanna check and see how she's doin'.

640
00:33:42,279 --> 00:33:43,446
- [Jack] Okay.

641
00:33:48,436 --> 00:33:49,653
- It's all right, Rick.

642
00:33:49,653 --> 00:33:50,713
I got you.

643
00:33:50,713 --> 00:33:51,713
- Is it bad?

644
00:33:55,408 --> 00:33:56,241
Oh God.

645
00:33:57,492 --> 00:34:02,492
(Rick's throat clearing)
(pensive music)

646
00:34:08,315 --> 00:34:11,065
(wind whistling)

647
00:34:13,387 --> 00:34:16,354
(Rick gasping)

648
00:34:16,354 --> 00:34:17,187
Hot!

649
00:34:24,183 --> 00:34:25,120
- [Jack] What's the matter with him?

650
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:27,130
- He's delirious, he doesn't
know what he's doing.

651
00:34:27,130 --> 00:34:28,650
- Rick, take it easy.

652
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:29,623
Sit down.

653
00:34:29,623 --> 00:34:32,206
(Rick gasping)

654
00:34:33,910 --> 00:34:35,090
Relax, buddy.

655
00:34:35,090 --> 00:34:36,350
Relax.
- Rick? Rick?

656
00:34:36,350 --> 00:34:37,183
- Relax.

657
00:34:37,183 --> 00:34:38,203
- [Teresa] Rick?

658
00:34:38,203 --> 00:34:40,786
(Rick panting)

659
00:34:42,105 --> 00:34:45,274
- Shh, it's all right, it's
all right, it's all right.

660
00:34:45,274 --> 00:34:46,228
- Okay.

661
00:34:46,228 --> 00:34:47,879
Okay.

662
00:34:47,879 --> 00:34:50,546
(Rick coughing)

663
00:34:52,019 --> 00:34:53,330
- It's serious isn't it?

664
00:34:53,330 --> 00:34:54,910
- Hypothermia.

665
00:34:54,910 --> 00:34:56,940
If we don't get him out
of here he's gonna freeze.

666
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:57,773
- Freeze?

667
00:35:00,083 --> 00:35:01,480
Are we all gonna freeze to death?

668
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:02,483
- No, we're not.

669
00:35:03,690 --> 00:35:06,860
- But he said that he was on
his way to freezing to death.

670
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:08,860
- If we work to stay warm we'll be fine.

671
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:11,763
- What about Sammy?

672
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:15,070
She'd be the first one to-

673
00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:17,010
- She's not gonna die.

674
00:35:17,010 --> 00:35:18,230
We're not gonna let her die.

675
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:19,063
I mean it.

676
00:35:21,450 --> 00:35:22,980
- She's everything to me.

677
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:26,420
- Jack, I have a child and so does Brad.

678
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:27,253
He has a little boy.

679
00:35:27,253 --> 00:35:28,086
Kids are everything.

680
00:35:28,086 --> 00:35:29,400
We're not gonna let her die.

681
00:35:30,810 --> 00:35:34,413
We can make a bed, use each
other's body heat to keep warm.

682
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:37,730
They know we're down.

683
00:35:37,730 --> 00:35:39,530
There'll be a search plane looking for us.

684
00:35:39,530 --> 00:35:40,997
- How long will that take?

685
00:35:42,110 --> 00:35:44,106
- We had a 120 mile per hour collision

686
00:35:44,106 --> 00:35:46,306
with a side of a mountain,
we're still here.

687
00:35:49,070 --> 00:35:50,070
I won't let her die.

688
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:52,793
I promise.

689
00:35:56,771 --> 00:35:57,604
- Yes, it's on hold.
- Hey, let's get movin'.

690
00:35:57,604 --> 00:36:00,170
ATC just cleared us for night flight.

691
00:36:00,170 --> 00:36:02,240
Why isn't my chopper warmin' up?

692
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:04,143
Come on guys, seconds are tickin' by.

693
00:36:06,110 --> 00:36:07,460
Why isn't anybody up there?

694
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:10,493
- Bob, there is no emergency
locator signal comin'

695
00:36:10,493 --> 00:36:11,493
from the wreck.

696
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:16,682
The transmitter's either
inoperable or destroyed.

697
00:36:16,682 --> 00:36:21,682
(pensive music)
(radio chattering)

698
00:36:23,870 --> 00:36:25,243
Without a radio beacon,

699
00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:30,993
the only thing we can do is a
visual search at first light.

700
00:36:32,970 --> 00:36:34,470
And it doesn't look very good.

701
00:36:37,370 --> 00:36:38,257
I'm sorry, Bob.

702
00:36:38,257 --> 00:36:43,257
(solemn music)
(radio chattering)

703
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:52,213
- At least we'll have something

704
00:36:52,213 --> 00:36:53,550
between us and the cold floor.

705
00:36:57,070 --> 00:36:57,903
Get Rick.

706
00:37:00,376 --> 00:37:02,940
(Rick coughing)

707
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:03,787
Here you go.

708
00:37:05,131 --> 00:37:06,214
There you go.

709
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:10,413
Jack?

710
00:37:10,413 --> 00:37:15,364
(pensive music)
(Jack grunting)

711
00:37:20,223 --> 00:37:21,056
Easy.

712
00:37:23,490 --> 00:37:24,820
- Ow.

713
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:26,323
- Oh, I'm sorry.

714
00:37:26,323 --> 00:37:27,736
- Okay.

715
00:37:27,736 --> 00:37:30,150
Come on, over here.

716
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:31,804
That a girl (groans).

717
00:37:31,804 --> 00:37:34,380
- [Teresa] Good girl.

718
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:35,213
There.

719
00:37:36,796 --> 00:37:38,028
Try to keep her warm.

720
00:37:38,028 --> 00:37:40,245
(Jack groaning)

721
00:37:40,245 --> 00:37:41,616
That's it, that's it.

722
00:37:41,616 --> 00:37:46,616
(Brad coughing)
(pensive music)

723
00:37:56,130 --> 00:37:59,640
She's shivering, but she feels so hot.

724
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:01,803
- [Teresa] It's the chills from the fever.

725
00:38:03,854 --> 00:38:04,854
- Oh, Sammy.

726
00:38:05,716 --> 00:38:08,416
Oh, Sammy.

727
00:38:08,416 --> 00:38:10,396
Oh, Sammy.

728
00:38:10,396 --> 00:38:11,229
Oh, Sammy.

729
00:38:11,229 --> 00:38:13,979
(wind whistling)

730
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,350
- Good news for the skiers.

731
00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:19,503
- [Jack] What?

732
00:38:21,070 --> 00:38:21,903
- Snow.

733
00:38:24,196 --> 00:38:27,302
The damn storm climb's caught up to us.

734
00:38:27,302 --> 00:38:30,100
(Jack panting)

735
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:32,013
- Well, how are they
gonna find us in that?

736
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:35,853
- I don't know.

737
00:38:36,961 --> 00:38:39,711
(wind whistling)

738
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:47,626
- I checked Glenwood Springs,

739
00:38:47,626 --> 00:38:49,257
the airport in Eagle, nothin'.

740
00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:52,280
I mean, maybe he turned back in at Elm,

741
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:55,400
which is on the heading of 2-6
back in the prevailing wind.

742
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,610
- The only logical course after that

743
00:38:58,610 --> 00:39:00,210
is an estimate landing at Aspen.

744
00:39:01,678 --> 00:39:03,867
That puts him between Rifle and Aspen.

745
00:39:04,730 --> 00:39:05,578
I'll meet you at the chopper.

746
00:39:05,578 --> 00:39:07,787
- I'll call Civil Air Patrol.

747
00:39:07,787 --> 00:39:09,658
And file a flight plan!

748
00:39:09,658 --> 00:39:14,658
(pensive music)
(wind whistling)

749
00:39:21,031 --> 00:39:23,698
(Brad grunting)

750
00:39:29,654 --> 00:39:31,558
- There's snow coming in.

751
00:39:31,558 --> 00:39:32,908
We're getting buried alive.

752
00:39:35,410 --> 00:39:37,122
- They'll never see us.

753
00:39:37,122 --> 00:39:39,980
- All right, we have to
(indistinct) cockpit.

754
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:42,780
I can feel the cold air coming
in from the front window.

755
00:39:43,830 --> 00:39:45,493
- How are we gonna get outta here?

756
00:39:46,932 --> 00:39:49,603
- Maybe we can dig our
way out when it quits.

757
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:51,315
- Wait a minute.

758
00:39:51,315 --> 00:39:52,960
- [Teresa] What?

759
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:53,793
- Wait a minute.

760
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:55,893
- Rick?

761
00:39:56,730 --> 00:39:57,910
Wake up, Rick.

762
00:39:57,910 --> 00:39:58,743
Wake up.

763
00:40:00,090 --> 00:40:01,673
Rick, wake up.

764
00:40:02,970 --> 00:40:03,840
Come on.

765
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,690
Where is the ELT?

766
00:40:05,690 --> 00:40:08,480
- Good, Brad, the ELT.

767
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:09,350
- Where is the ELT?

768
00:40:09,350 --> 00:40:10,530
Try to remember.

769
00:40:10,530 --> 00:40:11,960
Come on, wake up, Rick.

770
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:12,902
Where is the ELT?

771
00:40:12,902 --> 00:40:14,010
- What's an ELT?
- Come on.

772
00:40:14,010 --> 00:40:15,800
- An emergency locator transmitter.

773
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:16,810
Goes off when there's a crash.

774
00:40:16,810 --> 00:40:19,160
A search button and it hones
in on its transmission.

775
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:20,010
- Come on, think.

776
00:40:21,490 --> 00:40:22,323
- Rick?

777
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:24,900
Rick?
- What?

778
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:26,170
- Try to remember.

779
00:40:26,170 --> 00:40:27,093
The ELT.

780
00:40:28,470 --> 00:40:29,780
- Come on.
- The ELT!

781
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:31,180
- We gotta make sure it works.

782
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:32,910
Where is the ELT, Rick?

783
00:40:32,910 --> 00:40:33,743
Wake up.

784
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:35,673
Damn it, Rick!

785
00:40:35,673 --> 00:40:36,713
Wake up.
- Easy.

786
00:40:37,594 --> 00:40:40,110
- It's no use, his brain's a mess.

787
00:40:40,110 --> 00:40:41,276
- Okay.

788
00:40:41,276 --> 00:40:43,250
It's all right.

789
00:40:43,250 --> 00:40:45,750
It's all right.
- I don't know.

790
00:40:54,274 --> 00:40:57,191
(chopper whirring)

791
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:20,370
- Look, visibility's just about minimal.

792
00:41:20,370 --> 00:41:22,410
We can't keep flyin' like this.

793
00:41:22,410 --> 00:41:24,181
(indistinct)

794
00:41:24,181 --> 00:41:25,422
No way.

795
00:41:25,422 --> 00:41:26,800
- [Bob] There's a chance!

796
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,468
- Yeah, there's a chance
but if we keep goin' up

797
00:41:28,468 --> 00:41:30,733
we're gonna take on too much ice to fly.

798
00:41:32,310 --> 00:41:34,381
- It's Teresa, Robert.

799
00:41:34,381 --> 00:41:35,643
- Look, I know.

800
00:41:36,610 --> 00:41:37,690
But we gotta go back.

801
00:41:37,690 --> 00:41:39,020
We can't keep flyin' like this.

802
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:41,038
Now you are no good to her dead, Bob.

803
00:41:41,038 --> 00:41:43,955
(chopper whirring)

804
00:41:52,637 --> 00:41:54,177
- [Jack] What are you doing?

805
00:41:54,177 --> 00:41:55,952
- Taking her hydrate.

806
00:41:55,952 --> 00:41:57,173
It'll help her fever.

807
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:01,870
Sammy, come on, honey.

808
00:42:01,870 --> 00:42:03,570
Can you wake up?

809
00:42:03,570 --> 00:42:04,403
Sammy?

810
00:42:07,619 --> 00:42:10,369
- Hey, pumpkin, come on, wake up.

811
00:42:12,661 --> 00:42:14,078
Come on, wake up.

812
00:42:15,301 --> 00:42:16,134
Sammy?

813
00:42:18,343 --> 00:42:19,426
Hey, wake up.

814
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,417
- [Teresa] Sammy?

815
00:42:29,205 --> 00:42:31,788
(Patty sighs)

816
00:42:33,025 --> 00:42:34,225
- Something's happened.

817
00:42:34,225 --> 00:42:38,113
I know it.

818
00:42:38,113 --> 00:42:38,946
I know it.

819
00:42:45,530 --> 00:42:47,530
- Sammy's probably in surgery right now.

820
00:42:49,180 --> 00:42:50,543
She's gonna be fine, dear.

821
00:42:51,890 --> 00:42:53,240
Everything's gonna be fine.

822
00:42:58,970 --> 00:43:00,973
Everything's gonna be just fine.

823
00:43:00,973 --> 00:43:03,640
(pensive music)

824
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:14,750
- [Jack] Hey, Sammy, wake up.

825
00:43:14,750 --> 00:43:15,583
Sammy?

826
00:43:17,790 --> 00:43:19,516
Hi, Sammy.

827
00:43:19,516 --> 00:43:20,516
- Hi, Daddy.

828
00:43:24,424 --> 00:43:27,010
- Hi.

829
00:43:27,010 --> 00:43:28,433
- Here, open up, sweetie.

830
00:43:29,512 --> 00:43:31,460
Want a lollipop, huh?

831
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:32,460
That a girl.

832
00:43:34,158 --> 00:43:34,991
Open up.

833
00:43:36,276 --> 00:43:37,109
Good girl.

834
00:43:39,368 --> 00:43:40,201
- Hey.

835
00:43:41,468 --> 00:43:43,490
Look what I found.

836
00:43:43,490 --> 00:43:45,323
I found your Bow, huh?

837
00:43:47,424 --> 00:43:49,964
I'm gonna put him right in here

838
00:43:49,964 --> 00:43:52,850
so he can keep ya company, okay?

839
00:43:52,850 --> 00:43:57,850
Here ya go.

840
00:43:59,140 --> 00:44:00,240
I wanna say something.

841
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:07,406
I believe in God, and I
believe He will protect us

842
00:44:07,406 --> 00:44:10,543
in this time if we pray to Him.

843
00:44:12,850 --> 00:44:13,683
- Hey?

844
00:44:16,470 --> 00:44:18,320
You can pray all you want, all right?

845
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:22,550
But leave me out of this.

846
00:44:23,830 --> 00:44:25,080
I don't need you to preach to me.

847
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:25,913
- [Teresa] Brad.

848
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:28,163
- I wasn't going to preach.

849
00:44:33,875 --> 00:44:36,958
I just wanted to say what I believed.

850
00:44:38,690 --> 00:44:39,890
I thought it might help.

851
00:44:41,524 --> 00:44:46,524
(sighs) My faith has
always gotten me through.

852
00:44:47,730 --> 00:44:49,593
- I'm glad you told us, Jack.

853
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:52,968
I'm glad you have that to hold onto.

854
00:44:52,968 --> 00:44:57,968
(somber music)
(wind whistling)

855
00:45:02,628 --> 00:45:04,961
- [Bob] The plane went down.

856
00:45:11,260 --> 00:45:12,210
- In the mountains?

857
00:45:13,130 --> 00:45:13,963
- Yeah.

858
00:45:19,624 --> 00:45:22,760
(Angie sobbing)

859
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:25,913
I've been out looking but
the weather closed in.

860
00:45:27,070 --> 00:45:28,943
We'll blanket the area at dawn.

861
00:45:31,510 --> 00:45:34,807
- Oh, God, we had this fight
right before he left (panting).

862
00:45:37,967 --> 00:45:40,860
(Justin crying)

863
00:45:40,860 --> 00:45:41,693
Justin!

864
00:45:47,882 --> 00:45:49,239
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,

865
00:45:49,239 --> 00:45:51,672
what are you cryin' about little guy?

866
00:45:51,672 --> 00:45:53,276
Hey.

867
00:45:53,276 --> 00:45:55,853
Hey, you should be sleepin'.

868
00:45:55,853 --> 00:45:59,521
You should be under the
covers snug as a bug.

869
00:45:59,521 --> 00:46:01,537
Don't you know it's snowin' out?

870
00:46:01,537 --> 00:46:05,620
- I want my daddy, I want my daddy.

871
00:46:05,620 --> 00:46:09,250
- Well, he can't be here right now.

872
00:46:09,250 --> 00:46:10,133
I'm sorry.

873
00:46:11,317 --> 00:46:15,330
How 'bout I take ya up to bed, huh?

874
00:46:15,330 --> 00:46:16,329
Okay?

875
00:46:16,329 --> 00:46:17,162
All right.

876
00:46:18,770 --> 00:46:19,933
Come on there, buddy.

877
00:46:20,977 --> 00:46:21,810
Yeah.

878
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:25,761
Hey, tell me, hey you ever really seen

879
00:46:25,761 --> 00:46:28,041
a cow jump over the moon?

880
00:46:28,041 --> 00:46:29,193
- [Justin] No.

881
00:46:29,193 --> 00:46:34,193
(solemn music)
(wind whistling)

882
00:46:46,527 --> 00:46:48,943
- [Teresa] You okay?

883
00:46:48,943 --> 00:46:49,776
- Yeah.

884
00:46:51,573 --> 00:46:53,237
- Are you sure?

885
00:46:53,237 --> 00:46:54,070
- Mm hm.

886
00:46:57,720 --> 00:46:59,147
This cold is like a knife.

887
00:46:59,147 --> 00:46:59,980
- Mm.

888
00:47:02,150 --> 00:47:03,770
- You know, I was thinkin' about Angie

889
00:47:03,770 --> 00:47:07,820
and when I was on the air rescue in Alaska

890
00:47:07,820 --> 00:47:08,893
for the Air Force.

891
00:47:11,470 --> 00:47:13,513
I used to describe the crashes to her.

892
00:47:15,620 --> 00:47:16,693
I guess I needed her to think

893
00:47:16,693 --> 00:47:19,317
that I was some kinda hero or somethin'.

894
00:47:21,003 --> 00:47:23,673
And now she probably thinks
I'm one of the gory details.

895
00:47:29,530 --> 00:47:31,703
I have done so many things that are wrong.

896
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:38,400
And if we ever get out of here, I swear...

897
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:44,380
I swear I'm gonna do things different.

898
00:47:47,140 --> 00:47:47,973
Yeah.

899
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:51,113
Yeah.

900
00:47:52,296 --> 00:47:55,197
(flashlight clicks)

901
00:47:55,197 --> 00:47:57,947
(wind whistling)

902
00:47:59,790 --> 00:48:02,220
- Yeah, we're flyin' out
on our own at first light.

903
00:48:02,220 --> 00:48:04,220
How soon can they be here?

904
00:48:04,220 --> 00:48:05,500
Thanks.

905
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:07,470
I got two more search planes
comin' in from Denver.

906
00:48:07,470 --> 00:48:08,320
How are you doin, Robert?

907
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:11,833
- I got planes comin' in from
Aspen, Utah, the whole area.

908
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:14,320
Talk to Brad's wife yet?

909
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:15,940
- Yeah, it was hard on her.

910
00:48:15,940 --> 00:48:18,303
- Yeah, well, she knows the odds.

911
00:48:20,273 --> 00:48:22,433
(sighs) Jeez, I'm sorry, Bob.

912
00:48:22,433 --> 00:48:23,423
- It's okay.

913
00:48:24,665 --> 00:48:26,193
I know the odds, too.

914
00:48:30,406 --> 00:48:32,506
(sighs) I think I'll go home.

915
00:48:32,506 --> 00:48:34,577
Try to catch a couple hours.

916
00:48:34,577 --> 00:48:37,160
(solemn music)

917
00:48:40,060 --> 00:48:41,897
- Still gotta tell his kid.

918
00:48:41,897 --> 00:48:44,480
(solemn music)

919
00:49:07,517 --> 00:49:10,100
(Bob chuckles)

920
00:49:32,461 --> 00:49:33,628
- [Travis] What's the matter, Dad?

921
00:49:33,628 --> 00:49:36,300
(Bob exhales)

922
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:39,881
- [Bob] Your mother's plane
ran into a little trouble.

923
00:49:39,881 --> 00:49:40,723
- (stammers) Trouble?

924
00:49:42,028 --> 00:49:43,603
(stammers) What kinda trouble?

925
00:49:47,170 --> 00:49:48,440
- It went down in the mountains.

926
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:51,163
There's a chance that
she's still alive and...

927
00:49:52,900 --> 00:49:53,733
- A chance?

928
00:49:54,580 --> 00:49:55,413
- Travis.

929
00:49:56,591 --> 00:49:58,810
- This is winter in the Rocky's.

930
00:49:58,810 --> 00:50:00,510
- Travis, listen to me (chuckles).

931
00:50:01,460 --> 00:50:04,170
If there's even the slightest chance,

932
00:50:04,170 --> 00:50:08,203
you can bet your mother's
never gonna quit fighting, huh?

933
00:50:09,740 --> 00:50:11,273
Hey, neither are we.

934
00:50:12,565 --> 00:50:17,565
(pensive music)
(Bob sniffling)

935
00:50:27,089 --> 00:50:29,756
(Teresa coughs)

936
00:50:31,350 --> 00:50:32,760
- [Rick] Teresa?

937
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:36,163
Teresa, it's back there.

938
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:38,560
It's in the back (coughing).

939
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:45,460
In the compartment in the
back, in there, in there.

940
00:50:46,541 --> 00:50:48,098
- [Brad] Rick, what are you talking about?

941
00:50:48,098 --> 00:50:52,141
- (coughing) In the compartment.

942
00:50:52,141 --> 00:50:53,891
In the back in there.

943
00:50:55,447 --> 00:50:56,521
The ELT.

944
00:50:56,521 --> 00:50:58,431
(dramatic music)

945
00:50:58,431 --> 00:50:59,797
In the compartment.

946
00:50:59,797 --> 00:51:02,405
(music continues)

947
00:51:02,405 --> 00:51:07,405
(metal banging)
(Teresa groans)

948
00:51:09,780 --> 00:51:10,613
- [Brad] Got it!

949
00:51:17,394 --> 00:51:18,227
I got it.

950
00:51:19,063 --> 00:51:19,957
- You know how to work it?

951
00:51:19,957 --> 00:51:21,626
- Are you kidding me?

952
00:51:21,626 --> 00:51:23,773
This is gonna bring a search
party right on top of us.

953
00:51:27,427 --> 00:51:28,627
- What's the matter?

954
00:51:28,627 --> 00:51:30,147
(dramatic music)

955
00:51:30,147 --> 00:51:31,080
What's wrong?

956
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:32,764
- It's dead.

957
00:51:32,764 --> 00:51:33,784
- What?

958
00:51:33,784 --> 00:51:35,606
- The antenna's busted.

959
00:51:35,606 --> 00:51:37,876
(pensive music)

960
00:51:37,876 --> 00:51:41,268
Teresa, Teresa, this was our last chance.

961
00:51:41,268 --> 00:51:46,268
(wind whistling)
(pensive music)

962
00:51:50,540 --> 00:51:52,920
- Six wing aircraft
will be in the vicinity

963
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:56,330
of what we believe to be the
crash site at first light.

964
00:51:56,330 --> 00:51:58,770
We'll follow in with choppers at daybreak.

965
00:51:58,770 --> 00:51:59,603
Any questions?

966
00:51:59,603 --> 00:52:01,320
- [Man In Plaid] Yeah,
yeah, can I say something?

967
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:02,850
- [Bob] Sure, who are you?

968
00:52:02,850 --> 00:52:05,490
- I used to work for Mountain
Rescue over in Denver.

969
00:52:05,490 --> 00:52:06,620
I came down to warn you.

970
00:52:06,620 --> 00:52:07,970
- Yeah, well we know what we're doin'.

971
00:52:07,970 --> 00:52:09,980
- You don't even have an ELT signal,

972
00:52:09,980 --> 00:52:12,570
and without an ELT signal this search

973
00:52:12,570 --> 00:52:14,810
is like trying to find
an icicle in a blizzard.

974
00:52:14,810 --> 00:52:17,840
Now, if there was a 5%
chance I'd say go for it

975
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:19,653
but there is no chance,

976
00:52:20,710 --> 00:52:22,370
and if you go up there today some of you

977
00:52:22,370 --> 00:52:24,193
are very likely not to come back.

978
00:52:29,950 --> 00:52:31,636
- Maybe we should put this to a vote.

979
00:52:31,636 --> 00:52:32,670
- Oh!

980
00:52:32,670 --> 00:52:34,880
- I don't want anyone to risk themselves

981
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:36,770
so much on my account.

982
00:52:36,770 --> 00:52:37,640
- All right, fine!

983
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:39,060
Let's take a vote.

984
00:52:39,060 --> 00:52:40,610
Everybody who thinks we better get up

985
00:52:40,610 --> 00:52:43,224
off our butts and go
find these people say I!

986
00:52:43,224 --> 00:52:44,576
- [All] I!

987
00:52:44,576 --> 00:52:47,326
(all chattering)

988
00:52:50,459 --> 00:52:53,209
(Teresa humming)

989
00:52:55,628 --> 00:53:00,546
♪ Don't you cry ♪

990
00:53:00,546 --> 00:53:04,956
♪ Go to sleep ♪

991
00:53:04,956 --> 00:53:07,456
♪ Little baby ♪

992
00:53:11,345 --> 00:53:16,345
(PA chattering)
(phone ringing)

993
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:20,950
- Can I help you?

994
00:53:20,950 --> 00:53:22,230
- Hi, I'm Patty Bahr.

995
00:53:22,230 --> 00:53:23,720
I'm here to see my daughter, Samantha.

996
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:25,150
She's here for surgery.

997
00:53:25,150 --> 00:53:25,983
- Just a minute.

998
00:53:27,070 --> 00:53:28,567
Someone wants to talk to you.

999
00:53:30,343 --> 00:53:31,579
Mrs. Bahr is here.

1000
00:53:31,579 --> 00:53:34,246
(pensive music)

1001
00:53:41,260 --> 00:53:43,853
- Mrs. Bahr, I'm the chaplain here.

1002
00:53:45,310 --> 00:53:46,993
I'm afraid I have some bad news.

1003
00:53:51,740 --> 00:53:53,160
- [Teresa] Her fever's rising again.

1004
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:54,479
I've given her a big dose of antibiotics

1005
00:53:54,479 --> 00:53:57,543
but we're gonna have to ration the rest.

1006
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:00,629
- How long will they last?

1007
00:54:00,629 --> 00:54:02,840
(Teresa exhales)

1008
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:05,987
- Maybe 24 hours if she
doesn't get any worse.

1009
00:54:05,987 --> 00:54:08,654
(pensive music)

1010
00:54:12,110 --> 00:54:13,513
- Why is this happening?

1011
00:54:17,022 --> 00:54:20,580
(wind whistling)

1012
00:54:20,580 --> 00:54:24,730
- All right, we search the
grid between Rifle here

1013
00:54:24,730 --> 00:54:28,283
and the northwest, south
towards Aspen and the southeast.

1014
00:54:29,290 --> 00:54:30,370
We've all got our sectors.

1015
00:54:30,370 --> 00:54:33,934
Keep a listening watch on
121.5 for that ELT signal.

1016
00:54:33,934 --> 00:54:35,660
- [All] All right.

1017
00:54:35,660 --> 00:54:36,760
- Maybe we'll get lucky.

1018
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:38,920
- All right, guys, let's head out.

1019
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:41,080
- All right.
- After this storm blows over,

1020
00:54:41,080 --> 00:54:42,630
there's worst forecast for the afternoon.

1021
00:54:42,630 --> 00:54:43,746
- [Man] Oh no.

1022
00:54:43,746 --> 00:54:44,579
- Let's go get 'em.

1023
00:54:44,579 --> 00:54:46,753
(all chattering)

1024
00:54:46,753 --> 00:54:49,503
(wind whistling)

1025
00:54:59,443 --> 00:55:00,276
- I got an idea.

1026
00:55:01,810 --> 00:55:04,110
Tomorrow morning we'll
set the forest on fire.

1027
00:55:06,030 --> 00:55:08,230
No search plane is gonna
miss a forest fire.

1028
00:55:11,270 --> 00:55:12,641
- Hold it.

1029
00:55:12,641 --> 00:55:14,870
You could set us on fire, too.

1030
00:55:14,870 --> 00:55:17,340
Remember, we're covered in aviation fuel.

1031
00:55:17,340 --> 00:55:18,740
- It's evaporated, Jack.

1032
00:55:18,740 --> 00:55:20,690
- [Teresa] It's too dangerous.

1033
00:55:20,690 --> 00:55:21,713
- Okay, fine.

1034
00:55:23,300 --> 00:55:25,840
I'll go and get some
fuel from the wing tank,

1035
00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:29,040
I'll go 50 yard from the
plane and I'll torch one tree.

1036
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:30,420
- What about the wind?

1037
00:55:30,420 --> 00:55:31,420
- I'll go down wind.

1038
00:55:33,964 --> 00:55:34,960
- It might work.

1039
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:36,890
- What if the wind turns?

1040
00:55:36,890 --> 00:55:38,940
- Then we won't freeze to death.

1041
00:55:38,940 --> 00:55:40,790
Come on, guys, I gotta try something.

1042
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:44,223
- Okay, give it a try.

1043
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:47,760
- All right.

1044
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:49,630
I need some way to carry the fuel.

1045
00:55:49,630 --> 00:55:50,463
- What about a bed pan?

1046
00:55:50,463 --> 00:55:54,302
You can siphon the fuel out of
the wing tank with IV tubing.

1047
00:55:54,302 --> 00:55:55,567
- Okay, great.

1048
00:55:55,567 --> 00:55:56,723
Got any matches?

1049
00:55:57,756 --> 00:55:58,973
- I don't smoke.

1050
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:05,160
- Big surprise.

1051
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:06,020
You know, we're all gonna die

1052
00:56:06,020 --> 00:56:08,900
out here because we're
too health conscious.

1053
00:56:08,900 --> 00:56:10,050
Rick?

1054
00:56:10,050 --> 00:56:10,883
Rick?

1055
00:56:12,276 --> 00:56:13,603
Rick, wake up, buddy.

1056
00:56:15,910 --> 00:56:17,158
Is there any matches anywhere?

1057
00:56:17,158 --> 00:56:19,240
- What?

1058
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:20,460
- Wake up.

1059
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:21,800
Where are the matches?

1060
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:22,633
Matches?

1061
00:56:22,633 --> 00:56:23,770
Is there any matches anywhere?

1062
00:56:27,740 --> 00:56:29,845
- Back there, in there.

1063
00:56:29,845 --> 00:56:30,712
- Okay.

1064
00:56:30,712 --> 00:56:32,462
- The ELT's in there.

1065
00:56:36,063 --> 00:56:38,480
(Jack sighs)

1066
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:39,313
- Wait.

1067
00:56:40,860 --> 00:56:43,470
You can use battery
powered defibrillators.

1068
00:56:43,470 --> 00:56:45,783
You strike 'em together
it'll make a spark.

1069
00:56:45,783 --> 00:56:46,783
- All right.

1070
00:56:47,990 --> 00:56:49,980
I'll try that in the morning.

1071
00:56:53,103 --> 00:56:55,936
(Angie sniffling)

1072
00:56:59,068 --> 00:57:01,651
(solemn music)

1073
00:57:20,791 --> 00:57:23,541
(wind whizzing)

1074
00:57:27,975 --> 00:57:30,558
(Teresa gasps)

1075
00:57:33,343 --> 00:57:34,903
- It's only the wind.

1076
00:57:34,903 --> 00:57:37,736
(music continues)

1077
00:57:39,260 --> 00:57:40,380
Brad?

1078
00:57:40,380 --> 00:57:41,720
Brad?
- Huh?

1079
00:57:41,720 --> 00:57:42,690
- Jack?

1080
00:57:42,690 --> 00:57:43,523
Wake up.

1081
00:57:46,410 --> 00:57:48,000
Okay.

1082
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:48,833
It's light out.

1083
00:57:53,855 --> 00:57:56,897
Sammy?

1084
00:57:56,897 --> 00:57:57,730
Sammy?

1085
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,499
Sammy, honey, wake up.

1086
00:58:00,499 --> 00:58:01,370
- [Jack] What's the matter?

1087
00:58:01,370 --> 00:58:03,200
- Sammy?
- Teresa?

1088
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:04,490
What's the matter with her?

1089
00:58:04,490 --> 00:58:05,660
- Call to her, Jack.
- What?

1090
00:58:05,660 --> 00:58:06,670
- Let her hear your voice.

1091
00:58:06,670 --> 00:58:07,503
- Sammy?

1092
00:58:08,350 --> 00:58:09,183
Sammy?

1093
00:58:10,671 --> 00:58:12,171
Sammy?

1094
00:58:12,171 --> 00:58:14,287
Sammy?

1095
00:58:14,287 --> 00:58:15,120
Sammy?

1096
00:58:15,120 --> 00:58:17,911
(suspenseful music)

1097
00:58:17,911 --> 00:58:19,431
Oh, Sammy!

1098
00:58:19,431 --> 00:58:23,555
Oh, pumpkin (panting).

1099
00:58:23,555 --> 00:58:24,388
- I got her.

1100
00:58:24,388 --> 00:58:25,867
- We've gotta get out of here.

1101
00:58:25,867 --> 00:58:28,179
Come on, let's go.

1102
00:58:28,179 --> 00:58:29,012
- Good girl.

1103
00:58:29,012 --> 00:58:31,762
(dramatic music)

1104
00:58:32,675 --> 00:58:37,040
- [Jack] You really
believe this will work?

1105
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:38,701
- You're the one with all the beliefs.

1106
00:58:38,701 --> 00:58:41,451
(dramatic music)

1107
00:58:44,595 --> 00:58:45,509
(Jack groans)

1108
00:58:45,509 --> 00:58:48,342
(music continues)

1109
00:58:50,901 --> 00:58:54,118
(Brad groans)

1110
00:58:54,118 --> 00:58:56,785
(pensive music)

1111
00:58:58,750 --> 00:59:00,063
- We're in South Canyon.

1112
00:59:01,710 --> 00:59:03,600
- How do you know?

1113
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:05,040
- I hauled enough oil drilling equipment

1114
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:07,433
up this canyon to last a life time.

1115
00:59:10,110 --> 00:59:12,840
Servin' the Lord doesn't
always pay that well.

1116
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:13,683
- I guess I've been kinda tough on ya

1117
00:59:13,683 --> 00:59:16,000
with that whole church thing haven't I?

1118
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:16,833
- I've noticed.

1119
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:22,480
- Well, I think man shouldn't
have to depend on a crutch.

1120
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:23,880
- So, what do you depend on?

1121
00:59:25,810 --> 00:59:27,452
- Myself.

1122
00:59:27,452 --> 00:59:28,285
Let's go.

1123
00:59:32,170 --> 00:59:33,970
I gotta get fuel from the wing tank.

1124
00:59:35,890 --> 00:59:36,723
Got it?

1125
00:59:38,010 --> 00:59:40,218
Watch it, watch your step.

1126
00:59:40,218 --> 00:59:45,218
(Brad groaning)
(somber music)

1127
00:59:48,169 --> 00:59:49,090
- [Jack] You need some help?

1128
00:59:49,090 --> 00:59:49,923
- Got it.

1129
00:59:51,388 --> 00:59:54,055
(Brad grunting)

1130
00:59:59,969 --> 01:00:02,021
(Brad coughing)

1131
01:00:02,021 --> 01:00:02,854
- Brad!

1132
01:00:02,854 --> 01:00:07,854
(Brad yelling)
(dramatic music)

1133
01:00:08,893 --> 01:00:10,257
Brad?

1134
01:00:10,257 --> 01:00:11,090
Brad?

1135
01:00:13,341 --> 01:00:14,293
Brad?

1136
01:00:14,293 --> 01:00:15,889
(Jack groaning)
(Brad coughing)

1137
01:00:15,889 --> 01:00:16,722
Brad!

1138
01:00:19,813 --> 01:00:20,646
- [Brad] My ribs!

1139
01:00:20,646 --> 01:00:21,479
- Come on!

1140
01:00:21,479 --> 01:00:22,312
Come on.

1141
01:00:23,969 --> 01:00:24,802
Come on.

1142
01:00:24,802 --> 01:00:27,788
(Brad groaning)

1143
01:00:27,788 --> 01:00:29,094
Come on.

1144
01:00:29,094 --> 01:00:29,927
Come on.

1145
01:00:30,818 --> 01:00:31,651
Come on.

1146
01:00:31,651 --> 01:00:35,482
(suspenseful music)

1147
01:00:35,482 --> 01:00:36,738
(Jack groans)

1148
01:00:36,738 --> 01:00:39,405
(Brad grunting)

1149
01:00:46,733 --> 01:00:48,498
Brad?

1150
01:00:48,498 --> 01:00:49,746
- [Brad] I can do it!

1151
01:00:49,746 --> 01:00:50,579
- Stop.

1152
01:00:53,342 --> 01:00:54,759
Brad, Brad, stop.

1153
01:00:56,572 --> 01:00:57,772
Brad, Brad, Brad.

1154
01:00:57,772 --> 01:01:00,816
Brad, Brad, Brad, Brad!
- I can do it!

1155
01:01:00,816 --> 01:01:05,816
(solemn music)
(Brad grunting)

1156
01:01:07,017 --> 01:01:08,350
- [Jack] Teresa!

1157
01:01:10,150 --> 01:01:12,733
- Nothing works, nothing works.

1158
01:01:14,142 --> 01:01:15,090
(Jack grunting)

1159
01:01:15,090 --> 01:01:16,290
The snow's way too deep.

1160
01:01:17,320 --> 01:01:19,709
- We couldn't get anywhere (panting).

1161
01:01:19,709 --> 01:01:21,623
- They can't see us.

1162
01:01:23,069 --> 01:01:24,689
We trapped.

1163
01:01:24,689 --> 01:01:26,173
- We're not, Brad.

1164
01:01:26,173 --> 01:01:27,130
It's all right.

1165
01:01:27,130 --> 01:01:28,703
We'll try somethin' else.

1166
01:01:30,622 --> 01:01:32,010
We'll find another way.

1167
01:01:32,010 --> 01:01:33,160
- Don't you understand?

1168
01:01:34,091 --> 01:01:35,531
We're not gonna make it.

1169
01:01:35,531 --> 01:01:38,114
(solemn music)

1170
01:01:43,914 --> 01:01:48,164
We're not gonna make it (panting).

1171
01:01:49,151 --> 01:01:51,901
(wind whistling)

1172
01:02:00,861 --> 01:02:02,754
- Come on, Brad.

1173
01:02:02,754 --> 01:02:03,878
Come on.

1174
01:02:03,878 --> 01:02:05,520
You gotta keep moving.

1175
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:07,451
Come on.
- I'm tired of this.

1176
01:02:07,451 --> 01:02:08,284
I just wanna sleep.

1177
01:02:08,284 --> 01:02:09,363
- No, you can't sleep.

1178
01:02:11,940 --> 01:02:15,940
Hey, look at that little girl, huh?

1179
01:02:15,940 --> 01:02:17,040
She's growin' weaker by the hour

1180
01:02:17,040 --> 01:02:19,140
but she's fighting for light every minute.

1181
01:02:20,190 --> 01:02:21,023
Look at her.

1182
01:02:22,263 --> 01:02:24,500
Look at that little girl.

1183
01:02:24,500 --> 01:02:27,447
Think how'd you feel
if that were your kid.

1184
01:02:27,447 --> 01:02:28,497
- I just wanna sleep.

1185
01:02:30,920 --> 01:02:32,425
- You're scared.

1186
01:02:32,425 --> 01:02:33,380
- I'm not scared.

1187
01:02:33,380 --> 01:02:34,833
- Yeah, you're terrified.

1188
01:02:36,070 --> 01:02:38,819
You're afraid everyone
will know you're scared.

1189
01:02:38,819 --> 01:02:39,893
- I said I'm not scared.

1190
01:02:39,893 --> 01:02:40,950
- Oh, yeah!

1191
01:02:40,950 --> 01:02:43,970
Your whole life's based on
proving how brave you are.

1192
01:02:43,970 --> 01:02:46,080
You'd rather die than let
anyone know you're weak.

1193
01:02:46,080 --> 01:02:47,010
- Shut up!

1194
01:02:47,010 --> 01:02:48,486
- Prove me wrong, huh?

1195
01:02:48,486 --> 01:02:49,660
Prove me wrong.

1196
01:02:49,660 --> 01:02:51,848
I'll survive 'cause I'm
not a quitter like you.

1197
01:02:51,848 --> 01:02:54,598
(Teresa panting)

1198
01:02:56,750 --> 01:02:58,555
Listen, while you're up,

1199
01:02:58,555 --> 01:03:01,199
go check on Rick for me will ya?

1200
01:03:01,199 --> 01:03:03,949
(wind whistling)

1201
01:03:14,634 --> 01:03:17,467
(engine whirring)

1202
01:03:18,883 --> 01:03:21,774
- [Searcher] We're low enough.

1203
01:03:21,774 --> 01:03:22,607
- Nothing!

1204
01:03:24,099 --> 01:03:25,432
There's nothing!

1205
01:03:26,484 --> 01:03:27,687
It's too thick.

1206
01:03:27,687 --> 01:03:29,083
I'm goin' back up.

1207
01:03:29,083 --> 01:03:31,916
(engine whirring)

1208
01:03:39,480 --> 01:03:41,880
- Okay, that's better.

1209
01:03:41,880 --> 01:03:42,713
Come on, Rick.

1210
01:03:48,026 --> 01:03:49,280
Hey, Jack?

1211
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:50,939
Hand Sammy to Brad for
a minute, help me here.

1212
01:03:50,939 --> 01:03:51,772
- Okay.

1213
01:03:52,903 --> 01:03:55,570
(Jack grunting)

1214
01:04:01,814 --> 01:04:04,564
(Jack shivering)

1215
01:04:10,723 --> 01:04:13,306
(gentle music)

1216
01:04:16,270 --> 01:04:17,103
- Hey, Sammy.

1217
01:04:20,503 --> 01:04:22,603
I got a little kid just like you.

1218
01:04:30,991 --> 01:04:31,824
- Hi.

1219
01:04:37,398 --> 01:04:39,731
- And I wanna see him again.

1220
01:04:41,087 --> 01:04:44,360
I wanna hold him in my arms and tell

1221
01:04:44,360 --> 01:04:46,760
him I love him more than
anything in this world.

1222
01:04:52,798 --> 01:04:53,798
- Don't cry.

1223
01:04:59,639 --> 01:05:00,472
- What?

1224
01:05:01,827 --> 01:05:02,660
- Nothing.

1225
01:05:10,951 --> 01:05:13,451
(Jack groans)

1226
01:05:18,520 --> 01:05:20,313
- I know how you feel.

1227
01:05:27,670 --> 01:05:28,970
Wanna hold her for awhile?

1228
01:05:30,707 --> 01:05:31,540
- Yeah.

1229
01:05:33,892 --> 01:05:35,059
- Here you go.

1230
01:05:36,887 --> 01:05:37,849
That a girl.

1231
01:05:37,849 --> 01:05:40,432
(gentle music)

1232
01:05:52,591 --> 01:05:55,424
(engine whirring)

1233
01:06:02,830 --> 01:06:04,223
- You guys get anything?

1234
01:06:07,800 --> 01:06:08,820
- Nah, there's no ELT.

1235
01:06:08,820 --> 01:06:09,913
It's all (indistinct).

1236
01:06:09,913 --> 01:06:13,180
Into the mountains up there
there's no visibility at all.

1237
01:06:13,180 --> 01:06:14,530
- Could you guys try again?

1238
01:06:15,960 --> 01:06:17,670
With the storm comin' in this afternoon,

1239
01:06:17,670 --> 01:06:20,380
we'll barely have a two
hour window to find 'em.

1240
01:06:20,380 --> 01:06:21,740
When that front hits it could shut

1241
01:06:21,740 --> 01:06:23,223
the area down for a week.

1242
01:06:24,120 --> 01:06:25,390
- Sure.

1243
01:06:25,390 --> 01:06:27,530
We'll go back up as soon as we re-fuel.

1244
01:06:27,530 --> 01:06:28,830
- Thanks.

1245
01:06:28,830 --> 01:06:29,990
I mean it, thanks, guys.

1246
01:06:29,990 --> 01:06:30,823
It...

1247
01:06:33,299 --> 01:06:36,397
- It's no sweat, Bob.
- That was the last of it.

1248
01:06:37,450 --> 01:06:38,950
- Let's get these choppers up.

1249
01:06:39,808 --> 01:06:43,003
(dramatic music)

1250
01:06:43,003 --> 01:06:48,003
(engine revving)
(buttons clicking)

1251
01:07:12,463 --> 01:07:14,320
- [Jack] Are you gettin' anywhere?

1252
01:07:14,320 --> 01:07:15,910
- Except for the antenna I can't see

1253
01:07:15,910 --> 01:07:17,523
anything else wrong with this.

1254
01:07:18,417 --> 01:07:22,679
One time in Alaska we had
this ELT signal in a crash.

1255
01:07:22,679 --> 01:07:26,210
And this guy kept turning it on and off.

1256
01:07:26,210 --> 01:07:27,659
He was trying to tell us
that he was still alive

1257
01:07:27,659 --> 01:07:29,013
so we'd go after him.

1258
01:07:32,250 --> 01:07:33,150
- How'd it end up?

1259
01:07:34,070 --> 01:07:35,070
- We saved his life.

1260
01:07:36,223 --> 01:07:38,973
(lever clicking)

1261
01:07:40,635 --> 01:07:44,218
(chopper whirring faintly)

1262
01:08:38,910 --> 01:08:40,410
- Maybe we're not in the area.

1263
01:08:42,530 --> 01:08:44,068
Maybe we're not even close.

1264
01:08:44,068 --> 01:08:46,901
(engine whirring)

1265
01:09:00,110 --> 01:09:03,682
(static crackling)

1266
01:09:03,682 --> 01:09:06,515
(signal whirring)

1267
01:09:08,521 --> 01:09:09,380
There!

1268
01:09:09,380 --> 01:09:10,238
There, did you hear it?

1269
01:09:10,238 --> 01:09:11,586
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, it could be.

1270
01:09:11,586 --> 01:09:12,520
- That's it!

1271
01:09:12,520 --> 01:09:14,087
It's weak, but that's it!

1272
01:09:14,087 --> 01:09:15,760
See if we can lock in on it.

1273
01:09:15,760 --> 01:09:16,593
Mark?

1274
01:09:16,593 --> 01:09:17,990
Dearman?

1275
01:09:17,990 --> 01:09:19,573
Dearman? Where did he go?

1276
01:09:20,767 --> 01:09:23,517
(lever clicking)

1277
01:09:24,860 --> 01:09:25,693
- Maybe we could-

1278
01:09:25,693 --> 01:09:26,660
- No, you're right.

1279
01:09:26,660 --> 01:09:29,886
We'll clear the fuselage
so maybe they can see us.

1280
01:09:29,886 --> 01:09:30,719
- Okay.

1281
01:09:30,719 --> 01:09:35,719
(pensive music)
(Teresa coughing)

1282
01:09:41,740 --> 01:09:42,573
- Frozen solid.

1283
01:09:44,161 --> 01:09:45,328
We're trapped.

1284
01:09:53,926 --> 01:09:55,759
- What happened to it?

1285
01:09:57,394 --> 01:09:59,560
- We're way into our reserve tanks, Bob.

1286
01:09:59,560 --> 01:10:01,457
We gotta go back for fuel.

1287
01:10:01,457 --> 01:10:02,822
We can be back inside the hour.

1288
01:10:02,822 --> 01:10:07,822
(engine whirring)
(gentle music)

1289
01:10:10,247 --> 01:10:13,330
(objects clattering)

1290
01:10:14,835 --> 01:10:16,440
- [Brad] All right.

1291
01:10:16,440 --> 01:10:17,787
It's not that...

1292
01:10:17,787 --> 01:10:20,410
I think I can get through over there.

1293
01:10:20,410 --> 01:10:21,758
Grab this.
- No.

1294
01:10:21,758 --> 01:10:22,591
- Hold on.

1295
01:10:22,591 --> 01:10:23,998
You've been through enough.

1296
01:10:23,998 --> 01:10:25,165
I'll go.

1297
01:10:25,165 --> 01:10:27,832
(Brad grunting)

1298
01:10:30,149 --> 01:10:31,091
(Jack banging)

1299
01:10:31,091 --> 01:10:32,427
(Jack groans)

1300
01:10:32,427 --> 01:10:33,370
- You got it?

1301
01:10:33,370 --> 01:10:34,417
- [Jack] Yeah.

1302
01:10:34,417 --> 01:10:39,417
(Jack grunting)
(pensive music)

1303
01:11:00,830 --> 01:11:01,780
- Jack, you all right?

1304
01:11:01,780 --> 01:11:03,941
- [Jack] Yeah, I'm out.

1305
01:11:03,941 --> 01:11:04,774
I'm okay.

1306
01:11:04,774 --> 01:11:09,774
(wind whistling)
(Jack panting)

1307
01:11:21,818 --> 01:11:24,568
(Sammy coughing)

1308
01:11:26,257 --> 01:11:29,331
(explosion booming)

1309
01:11:29,331 --> 01:11:33,990
(Teresa gasping)
(eerie music)

1310
01:11:33,990 --> 01:11:35,090
- You're hurt, Teresa.

1311
01:11:36,729 --> 01:11:37,979
- No, I'm fine.

1312
01:11:39,129 --> 01:11:39,962
Ah!

1313
01:11:43,790 --> 01:11:45,090
- We need to deal with it.

1314
01:11:47,750 --> 01:11:50,193
- (gasps) There's no time for that.

1315
01:11:52,597 --> 01:11:54,733
This is the last of the antibiotics.

1316
01:11:54,733 --> 01:11:56,363
I think she's getting worse.

1317
01:12:02,690 --> 01:12:03,563
- It's white!

1318
01:12:04,630 --> 01:12:05,913
The plane's white!

1319
01:12:07,780 --> 01:12:09,890
The fuselage is white!

1320
01:12:09,890 --> 01:12:11,593
- Try the wing, Jack!

1321
01:12:13,103 --> 01:12:17,790
(Jack grunting)
(wind whistling)

1322
01:12:17,790 --> 01:12:18,853
Jack, be careful.

1323
01:12:26,450 --> 01:12:27,773
I'm on the nose.

1324
01:12:27,773 --> 01:12:32,773
(Jack gasping)
(suspenseful music)

1325
01:12:42,473 --> 01:12:44,723
I got an orange stripe on the nose!

1326
01:12:47,509 --> 01:12:50,176
(Jack grunting)

1327
01:12:51,123 --> 01:12:52,623
I can't get the...

1328
01:12:55,805 --> 01:12:57,605
There, I got it!

1329
01:12:57,605 --> 01:13:00,093
(Jack grunting)

1330
01:13:00,093 --> 01:13:02,927
- If he falls, I won't be
able to get him in time.

1331
01:13:02,927 --> 01:13:07,927
(dramatic music)
(wind whistling)

1332
01:13:14,659 --> 01:13:15,933
- I'm comin' in!

1333
01:13:15,933 --> 01:13:16,766
Open it.

1334
01:13:16,766 --> 01:13:21,766
(Jack grunting)
(Jack banging)

1335
01:13:31,687 --> 01:13:33,841
Come on, come on!

1336
01:13:33,841 --> 01:13:36,508
(Jack groaning)

1337
01:13:42,129 --> 01:13:43,473
I got it cleared.

1338
01:13:43,473 --> 01:13:46,969
- [Brad] I'm gonna go
outside for a signal.

1339
01:13:46,969 --> 01:13:48,283
- The wing's kinda small.

1340
01:13:49,270 --> 01:13:51,077
I don't know if they're
gonna be able to see us.

1341
01:13:51,077 --> 01:13:56,077
(wind whistling)
(Jack gasping)

1342
01:13:59,179 --> 01:14:00,328
Oh, my feet!

1343
01:14:00,328 --> 01:14:02,324
I can't feel my feet.

1344
01:14:02,324 --> 01:14:04,045
My legs, ow!

1345
01:14:04,045 --> 01:14:05,590
My legs, my legs are numb (gasping).

1346
01:14:05,590 --> 01:14:07,663
Oh, it's happening so fast.

1347
01:14:07,663 --> 01:14:09,330
I can't feel my legs!

1348
01:14:09,330 --> 01:14:10,960
- You're hypothermic, Jack.

1349
01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:13,320
Keep the blood going.
- Oh, God!

1350
01:14:13,320 --> 01:14:14,853
Oh, God, please!

1351
01:14:15,872 --> 01:14:16,705
I can't...

1352
01:14:16,705 --> 01:14:19,528
I can't feel my legs!
(Teresa speaking indistinctly)

1353
01:14:19,528 --> 01:14:21,450
We're dyin' out here!

1354
01:14:22,447 --> 01:14:23,801
- Come on, Jack.

1355
01:14:23,801 --> 01:14:24,634
Come on.

1356
01:14:27,350 --> 01:14:30,540
- You're not goin' outside anymore.

1357
01:14:30,540 --> 01:14:31,373
It's too cold.

1358
01:14:40,670 --> 01:14:41,503
- You did a good job.

1359
01:14:41,503 --> 01:14:43,599
They can see us now.

1360
01:14:43,599 --> 01:14:46,182
(solemn music)

1361
01:14:49,059 --> 01:14:50,910
- A steady stream of search aircraft

1362
01:14:50,910 --> 01:14:52,401
are coming and going from the space

1363
01:14:52,401 --> 01:14:54,540
in search of the Angel Flight

1364
01:14:54,540 --> 01:14:58,020
that went down somewhere between
here and Aspen last night.

1365
01:14:58,020 --> 01:14:59,850
And a new storm front is expected

1366
01:14:59,850 --> 01:15:02,100
to hit this area within a few hours.

1367
01:15:02,100 --> 01:15:03,607
The pilots in this desperate search said

1368
01:15:03,607 --> 01:15:06,720
they must find the
victims of the crash soon,

1369
01:15:06,720 --> 01:15:09,750
before the new storm makes
it virtually impossible.

1370
01:15:09,750 --> 01:15:12,810
The Civil Air Patrol is
working at full force.

1371
01:15:12,810 --> 01:15:14,372
This is Martine Singer reporting live

1372
01:15:14,372 --> 01:15:17,710
from Glenwood in Colorado.
- Please, God.

1373
01:15:17,710 --> 01:15:19,273
Please watch over my family.

1374
01:15:22,090 --> 01:15:23,903
- There's nothing like a sleeping child.

1375
01:15:25,590 --> 01:15:27,737
So innocent, so peaceful.

1376
01:15:27,737 --> 01:15:30,320
(gentle music)

1377
01:15:32,540 --> 01:15:33,617
Funny the things you think about

1378
01:15:33,617 --> 01:15:36,970
when you get in a fix like this.

1379
01:15:36,970 --> 01:15:38,763
I remember when my son, Travis,

1380
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:41,300
was around two or...

1381
01:15:42,335 --> 01:15:43,830
I took him to a new playground

1382
01:15:43,830 --> 01:15:45,900
and I told him to stay off the slide.

1383
01:15:45,900 --> 01:15:50,393
So, naturally he had to sneak
over there and try it himself.

1384
01:15:52,560 --> 01:15:53,823
He nearly fell off.

1385
01:15:54,780 --> 01:15:56,773
He was hangin' there upside down.

1386
01:15:59,740 --> 01:16:01,890
I could tell he hated
having to be rescued,

1387
01:16:03,665 --> 01:16:05,723
but he was glad I was there.

1388
01:16:09,050 --> 01:16:10,060
I was actually thinking

1389
01:16:10,060 --> 01:16:13,027
about makin' this my
last flight (chuckles).

1390
01:16:15,870 --> 01:16:19,710
Maybe taking some nice,
safe work on the ground.

1391
01:16:22,867 --> 01:16:25,784
(engines whirring)

1392
01:16:43,283 --> 01:16:47,616
(rescue crew speaking indistinctly)

1393
01:16:53,091 --> 01:16:54,924
When I left yesterday,

1394
01:16:57,139 --> 01:17:00,806
I promised him I'd be
back for his birthday.

1395
01:17:02,615 --> 01:17:05,722
I'd hate it if the last thing
I ever did was lie to my son.

1396
01:17:05,722 --> 01:17:08,305
(gentle music)

1397
01:17:12,110 --> 01:17:15,693
(engines whirring faintly)

1398
01:17:16,866 --> 01:17:17,887
- That's a...

1399
01:17:17,887 --> 01:17:19,146
(Sammy coughing)

1400
01:17:19,146 --> 01:17:20,694
- [Jack and Teresa] That's a plane!

1401
01:17:20,694 --> 01:17:23,111
(soft music)

1402
01:17:29,156 --> 01:17:30,104
- Hey, let's split up.

1403
01:17:30,104 --> 01:17:31,620
I'll fly on with Frank.

1404
01:17:31,620 --> 01:17:33,203
Double our chances.

1405
01:17:35,388 --> 01:17:38,971
(Bob yelling indistinctly)

1406
01:17:42,627 --> 01:17:43,460
All right.

1407
01:17:43,460 --> 01:17:46,377
(engines whirring)

1408
01:18:00,417 --> 01:18:03,228
- Unidentified aircraft,
unidentified aircraft,

1409
01:18:03,228 --> 01:18:06,963
we are west of you, I
repeat, we are west of you.

1410
01:18:08,160 --> 01:18:10,428
(static crackling)

1411
01:18:10,428 --> 01:18:13,845
(engine whirring fades)

1412
01:18:25,008 --> 01:18:27,240
The damn plane didn't see us.

1413
01:18:27,240 --> 01:18:29,133
- Sammy, come on, wake up.

1414
01:18:30,530 --> 01:18:31,530
I can't wake her up.

1415
01:18:34,612 --> 01:18:35,823
I'm losing her.

1416
01:18:36,920 --> 01:18:37,753
She's dying.

1417
01:18:39,592 --> 01:18:40,425
- Sammy?

1418
01:18:41,718 --> 01:18:42,968
Give her to me.

1419
01:18:46,250 --> 01:18:47,483
- Sammy, wake up.

1420
01:18:48,380 --> 01:18:49,620
- Sammy?
- Pumpkin.

1421
01:18:49,620 --> 01:18:51,340
- [Teresa] Come on, Sammy.

1422
01:18:51,340 --> 01:18:52,240
She's unconscious.

1423
01:18:53,330 --> 01:18:54,308
Come on, Sammy.

1424
01:18:54,308 --> 01:18:56,975
(pensive music)

1425
01:18:59,958 --> 01:19:02,327
- "Our Father, who art in heaven,

1426
01:19:02,327 --> 01:19:03,854
hallowed be thy name.

1427
01:19:03,854 --> 01:19:05,220
Thy kingdom come,

1428
01:19:05,220 --> 01:19:08,206
thy will be done on
earth as it is in heaven.

1429
01:19:08,206 --> 01:19:10,290
Give us this day our daily bread."

1430
01:19:10,290 --> 01:19:11,870
- [Teresa] Sammy?
(musical chiming)

1431
01:19:11,870 --> 01:19:13,120
Come on, Sammy.

1432
01:19:14,562 --> 01:19:17,229
(pensive music)

1433
01:19:33,630 --> 01:19:35,990
- Mom, the people searching Rifle say

1434
01:19:35,990 --> 01:19:40,070
that a signal has been heard
from the emergency transmitter.

1435
01:19:40,070 --> 01:19:41,878
Now, I'm not sure what that means.

1436
01:19:41,878 --> 01:19:45,560
(PA announcer chattering)

1437
01:19:45,560 --> 01:19:47,463
That's a good thing though, isn't it, Mom?

1438
01:19:48,300 --> 01:19:49,692
- Oh, I hope so, honey.

1439
01:19:49,692 --> 01:19:51,070
I hope so.

1440
01:19:51,070 --> 01:19:54,146
(gentle music)
(PA announcer chattering)

1441
01:19:54,146 --> 01:19:56,813
(pensive music)

1442
01:20:15,519 --> 01:20:18,352
(engine whirring)

1443
01:20:31,422 --> 01:20:33,672
- We're runnin' outta time.

1444
01:20:38,326 --> 01:20:40,743
They gotta be here somewhere.

1445
01:20:47,386 --> 01:20:48,219
Come on.

1446
01:20:49,814 --> 01:20:50,981
Where are you?

1447
01:21:00,759 --> 01:21:03,426
(pensive music)

1448
01:21:11,546 --> 01:21:12,926
- Hold hand, Daddy.

1449
01:21:12,926 --> 01:21:14,521
Hold hand, Daddy.

1450
01:21:14,521 --> 01:21:16,081
Hold hand, Daddy.

1451
01:21:16,081 --> 01:21:18,664
(gentle music)

1452
01:21:20,821 --> 01:21:23,821
(singer vocalizing)

1453
01:21:27,973 --> 01:21:30,970
- She's a fighter, she just won't quit.

1454
01:21:30,970 --> 01:21:35,970
(engine whirring)
(hopeful music)

1455
01:21:39,843 --> 01:21:41,763
- It's right on top of us.

1456
01:21:44,007 --> 01:21:49,007
(Brad panting)
(triumphant music)

1457
01:21:49,871 --> 01:21:50,704
Over here!

1458
01:21:52,981 --> 01:21:53,814
Over here!

1459
01:21:57,710 --> 01:21:59,507
Come on, give us a sign!

1460
01:22:08,597 --> 01:22:10,847
They can't see the blanket!

1461
01:22:13,958 --> 01:22:14,870
- Here!

1462
01:22:14,870 --> 01:22:17,440
Brad, here.

1463
01:22:17,440 --> 01:22:18,703
Try this as a reflector.

1464
01:22:23,790 --> 01:22:24,623
- Come on.

1465
01:22:25,751 --> 01:22:26,918
- Where is it?

1466
01:22:31,348 --> 01:22:32,765
- There's no sun.

1467
01:22:37,893 --> 01:22:39,757
- The blanket, here.

1468
01:22:39,757 --> 01:22:41,700
Drench it in fuel.

1469
01:22:41,700 --> 01:22:42,810
We'll light it on fire.

1470
01:22:42,810 --> 01:22:44,001
- Okay.

1471
01:22:44,001 --> 01:22:49,001
(Brad panting)
(pensive music)

1472
01:22:49,353 --> 01:22:50,273
- Give it to me, the defibrillators.

1473
01:22:50,273 --> 01:22:51,900
It's the machine there.

1474
01:22:51,900 --> 01:22:52,733
- This?

1475
01:22:52,733 --> 01:22:53,629
- [Teresa] Yeah, the
whole handle, pick it up.

1476
01:22:53,629 --> 01:22:57,003
(pensive music)

1477
01:22:57,003 --> 01:23:00,293
(fuel sloshing)

1478
01:23:00,293 --> 01:23:01,710
- [Brad] Come on!

1479
01:23:05,645 --> 01:23:06,861
- [Teresa] I'm gonna set it on fire.

1480
01:23:06,861 --> 01:23:07,694
- Okay.

1481
01:23:08,541 --> 01:23:12,081
Just throw it as far as you can.

1482
01:23:12,081 --> 01:23:13,099
- Okay, go.

1483
01:23:13,099 --> 01:23:18,099
(air whooshing)
(somber music)

1484
01:23:23,317 --> 01:23:24,817
- I can't see 'em.

1485
01:23:39,605 --> 01:23:42,522
(triumphant music)

1486
01:23:45,065 --> 01:23:46,232
- [Brad] Yeah!

1487
01:23:59,925 --> 01:24:01,829
- We made it!

1488
01:24:01,829 --> 01:24:02,662
- Yeah!

1489
01:24:02,662 --> 01:24:07,662
(singer vocalizing)
(music continues)

1490
01:24:45,271 --> 01:24:47,045
- Come on, Sammy, sweetie.

1491
01:24:47,045 --> 01:24:48,962
Come on, hang in there.

1492
01:24:50,240 --> 01:24:51,473
Outta time, Bob.

1493
01:24:52,410 --> 01:24:53,881
We gotta get her off this mountain.

1494
01:24:53,881 --> 01:24:58,881
(singer vocalizing)
(engine whirring)

1495
01:25:11,731 --> 01:25:13,064
- Rick, come on.

1496
01:25:15,013 --> 01:25:17,290
- Civil Air Patrol has a plane waiting

1497
01:25:17,290 --> 01:25:18,770
to rush you to Denver.

1498
01:25:18,770 --> 01:25:20,940
- We gotta get Rick outta here
too, he's got head injuries.

1499
01:25:20,940 --> 01:25:23,570
- We'll all fit in my machine,
let's get him onboard.

1500
01:25:23,570 --> 01:25:24,980
- We're goin' home.

1501
01:25:24,980 --> 01:25:26,420
- [Bob] Easy.

1502
01:25:26,420 --> 01:25:27,370
- Got him?
- Yeah.

1503
01:25:30,140 --> 01:25:32,278
Listen, Rick, there's about one place

1504
01:25:32,278 --> 01:25:33,800
on this whole mountainside

1505
01:25:33,800 --> 01:25:36,003
you coulda set this
plane down in one piece.

1506
01:25:37,410 --> 01:25:39,310
You did one hell of a job of piloting.

1507
01:25:40,200 --> 01:25:41,483
I'd fly with you any day.

1508
01:25:44,160 --> 01:25:44,993
- We did it.

1509
01:25:46,097 --> 01:25:47,097
- We did it.

1510
01:25:50,221 --> 01:25:52,240
You know all that stuff
that you said about me?

1511
01:25:52,240 --> 01:25:53,073
About...

1512
01:25:54,480 --> 01:25:56,200
- No, I didn't mean that.

1513
01:25:56,200 --> 01:25:57,033
I was just-

1514
01:25:57,033 --> 01:25:57,866
- You were right.

1515
01:25:59,250 --> 01:26:00,683
I do put on a big show.

1516
01:26:02,880 --> 01:26:03,713
- Me too.

1517
01:26:07,630 --> 01:26:08,463
- You?

1518
01:26:09,720 --> 01:26:11,907
- Shakin' in my boots the whole time.

1519
01:26:11,907 --> 01:26:14,490
(gentle music)

1520
01:26:15,804 --> 01:26:17,738
- Come on, buddy, let's go home.

1521
01:26:17,738 --> 01:26:20,739
(gentle music)

1522
01:26:20,739 --> 01:26:21,572
- Okay.

1523
01:26:24,726 --> 01:26:25,991
(Teresa groans)

1524
01:26:25,991 --> 01:26:28,574
(gentle music)

1525
01:26:40,403 --> 01:26:45,403
(triumphant music)
(engine whirring)

1526
01:27:00,290 --> 01:27:03,540
(all speaking faintly)

1527
01:27:19,435 --> 01:27:21,435
- [Justin] Daddy, Daddy!

1528
01:27:24,454 --> 01:27:25,287
- You okay?

1529
01:27:25,287 --> 01:27:30,287
(gentle music)
(rescuers chattering)

1530
01:27:38,971 --> 01:27:39,837
I've gotta tell you something.

1531
01:27:39,837 --> 01:27:41,842
- No, I have to tell you.

1532
01:27:41,842 --> 01:27:42,736
I am so sorry.

1533
01:27:42,736 --> 01:27:43,569
- You're sorry?

1534
01:27:43,569 --> 01:27:45,076
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry.

1535
01:27:45,076 --> 01:27:48,947
(Angie chuckles)
(Brad chuckles)

1536
01:27:48,947 --> 01:27:51,000
- I realized something out there.

1537
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:52,913
I almost lost it out there, Angie.

1538
01:27:54,739 --> 01:27:57,543
- No, no, you didn't because you're here.

1539
01:27:58,727 --> 01:28:01,049
- But if I had been alone, I...

1540
01:28:01,049 --> 01:28:02,249
I wouldn't have made it.

1541
01:28:03,512 --> 01:28:07,103
- Baby, you're not alone, okay?

1542
01:28:14,532 --> 01:28:17,712
- I love you.

1543
01:28:17,712 --> 01:28:19,103
I love you.

1544
01:28:19,103 --> 01:28:20,607
- I love you.

1545
01:28:20,607 --> 01:28:21,623
- Daddy, daddy!

1546
01:28:25,851 --> 01:28:27,570
Can we go skiing when we get home?

1547
01:28:27,570 --> 01:28:29,063
There's lots of snow now.

1548
01:28:30,010 --> 01:28:35,010
(Angie laughs)
(Justin laughs)

1549
01:28:35,079 --> 01:28:40,079
(PA announcer chattering)
(gentle music)

1550
01:28:43,763 --> 01:28:45,159
- Jack!

1551
01:28:45,159 --> 01:28:47,409
Jack, you should be in bed.

1552
01:28:49,308 --> 01:28:51,808
(Patty sighs)

1553
01:28:53,240 --> 01:28:55,207
- Have you heard anything yet?

1554
01:28:55,207 --> 01:28:56,374
- No, not yet.

1555
01:29:01,610 --> 01:29:04,367
- You're a hero (chuckles).

1556
01:29:05,815 --> 01:29:07,165
I don't know how ya did it.

1557
01:29:08,660 --> 01:29:11,940
- It's funny, the
hardest part was thinking

1558
01:29:11,940 --> 01:29:14,190
about what you and Travis
were goin' through.

1559
01:29:19,420 --> 01:29:20,870
- Oh, it was an ordeal all right.

1560
01:29:20,870 --> 01:29:22,230
The kid's cookin's pretty awful.

1561
01:29:22,230 --> 01:29:24,450
Oh, Travis, hey buddy.

1562
01:29:25,775 --> 01:29:27,199
- Hey.
- Hey.

1563
01:29:27,199 --> 01:29:30,483
- You know the birthday we
promised to have together?

1564
01:29:30,483 --> 01:29:33,066
(gentle music)

1565
01:29:34,200 --> 01:29:35,133
- You bought that.

1566
01:29:36,259 --> 01:29:38,676
(Bob laughs)

1567
01:29:39,990 --> 01:29:41,419
- I got somethin' for ya.

1568
01:29:41,419 --> 01:29:44,002
(gentle music)

1569
01:29:46,939 --> 01:29:51,939
- (stammering) I'm so happy
that you're like, okay.

1570
01:29:52,019 --> 01:29:57,019
- I told ya I'd make it back.

1571
01:29:58,831 --> 01:30:00,258
Happy birthday, kid.

1572
01:30:00,258 --> 01:30:02,841
(gentle music)

1573
01:30:06,120 --> 01:30:08,870
(wind whistling)

1574
01:30:09,890 --> 01:30:13,220
People don't walk away from
mountain crashes like ours.

1575
01:30:13,220 --> 01:30:15,000
Maybe Jack was right.

1576
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:16,283
Maybe it was a miracle.

1577
01:30:17,760 --> 01:30:21,313
Today, Jack continues to
inspire his congregation.

1578
01:30:22,650 --> 01:30:24,380
Brad still is a paramedic,

1579
01:30:24,380 --> 01:30:28,150
and Rick, our pilot fully
recovered from his injuries.

1580
01:30:28,150 --> 01:30:30,520
He was exonerated of any pilot error.

1581
01:30:30,520 --> 01:30:33,900
It was determined that a
mechanical error caused the crash.

1582
01:30:33,900 --> 01:30:36,700
Rick resumed his air charter business.

1583
01:30:36,700 --> 01:30:40,720
And me, I'm still flying
the Angel Flights,

1584
01:30:40,720 --> 01:30:42,713
though sometimes I ask myself why.

1585
01:30:44,150 --> 01:30:46,470
But you know, the little girl, Sammy,

1586
01:30:46,470 --> 01:30:48,859
we put it on the line for her.

1587
01:30:48,859 --> 01:30:51,019
Sammy's doing just fine.

1588
01:30:51,019 --> 01:30:52,410
(Sammy laughing)

1589
01:30:52,410 --> 01:30:53,293
- You ready for the fun stuff?

1590
01:30:53,293 --> 01:30:54,418
You ready?

1591
01:30:54,418 --> 01:30:56,757
Here it goes! Five!

1592
01:30:56,757 --> 01:30:58,199
(Sammy squeals)

1593
01:30:58,199 --> 01:31:00,782
(gentle music)

1594
01:31:11,924 --> 01:31:14,841
(triumphant music)

1595
01:31:58,567 --> 01:32:01,234
(gentle music)
