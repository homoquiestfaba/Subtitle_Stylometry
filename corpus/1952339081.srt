1
00:01:20,372 --> 00:01:22,372
I told you smile.

2
00:04:02,451 --> 00:04:04,576
Galya, they will kill us.

3
00:04:05,162 --> 00:04:08,190
Galya, they will kill us, I know.
And I do not want to die.

4
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:11,460
Do not show that we are afraid.

5
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:14,405
They will kill us. I do not want to die.

6
00:04:14,505 --> 00:04:16,798
Calm down. Calm down.

7
00:04:17,174 --> 00:04:19,174
Stop. Stop.

8
00:04:29,478 --> 00:04:31,478
Where is it?

9
00:04:32,648 --> 00:04:34,648
Where is he?

10
00:04:38,028 --> 00:04:41,406
No, it's mine. This is mine.

11
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:50,121
Quiet you.

12
00:05:06,974 --> 00:05:09,017
No. No No

13
00:05:15,774 --> 00:05:17,814
Give it back, it's mine.

14
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:27,492
Give, give.

15
00:07:03,549 --> 00:07:05,549
So what are you doing?

16
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:12,011
Is this your gratitude for
everything I do for you?

17
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:43,800
If you want, as Nina finish?

18
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:50,318
They buried her in Rishon,
on the beach. Three meters in depth.

19
00:07:50,846 --> 00:07:53,015
Are you going same make.

20
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:58,863
You're not listening, maybe, me?

21
00:08:00,397 --> 00:08:03,217
Come on, face wash, change your clothes

22
00:08:03,317 --> 00:08:07,142
and quickly back into the slot.
Time is short.

23
00:08:10,449 --> 00:08:12,449
I hurt all over.

24
00:08:13,452 --> 00:08:15,104

25
00:08:15,204 --> 00:08:17,499
Did not you hear me at all?

26
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:23,670
I'm not coming back there.

27
00:08:29,718 --> 00:08:35,413
They'll all be burned and the ashes
podmetut that the dust was left.

28
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,046
Give me leave.

29
00:08:41,146 --> 00:08:43,565
Listen, crablouse.

30
00:08:45,192 --> 00:08:47,236

32
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:53,116
Who are you? Damn last.

00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:56,343
The child threw her,

34
00:08:56,537 --> 00:09:00,362
Bitch, you're all alive because I so want to.

35
00:09:07,798 --> 00:09:09,798
You want to go?

36
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:14,037

Want me to help you?

So help me.

39
00:09:18,976 --> 00:09:20,976

Gimme.

41
00:09:33,782 --> 00:09:36,368
Yours, from that moment.

00:09:37,286 --> 00:09:40,122
Now get out of machine, go there,

Okay?

45
00:09:49,298 --> 00:09:50,824
In the nest you did not want to.

46
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:54,494
Will you give debt so.
It's quick and easy.

Listen to what is going on with this link

55
00:10:26,919 --> 00:10:30,364
At the other end of the Earth
dude made a photograph,

56
00:10:30,464 --> 00:10:32,504
second - and it is here.

57
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:35,133
Fantastic.

58
00:10:35,177 --> 00:10:37,246
Softly, softly, softly. Calm.

59
00:10:37,346 --> 00:10:39,346
Yes you are quiet.

60
00:10:41,308 --> 00:10:44,353
Forces ashore. Not pulled,

61
00:10:44,603 --> 00:10:46,939
not kill her. Mad or what?

62
00:10:47,731 --> 00:10:50,281
We're not beasts of some kind.

63
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:53,151
Just a pity her.

64
00:10:53,654 --> 00:10:55,654
Look how beautiful.

65
00:10:56,198 --> 00:10:58,267
They will make out of it the same as you.

66
00:10:58,367 --> 00:10:59,935
Well, imagine how annoying.

67
00:11:00,035 --> 00:11:02,035
Go your way.

68
00:11:02,287 --> 00:11:05,482
Your debts will pay
once you were resisting.

69
00:11:05,582 --> 00:11:07,582

Oh, thank you, Lord.

74
00:11:37,531 --> 00:11:39,433
This is what I wanted from you to hear.

75
00:11:39,533 --> 00:11:42,227
You're right, Pantera, clever.
I love you for it.

76
00:11:42,327 --> 00:11:45,080
You see, you grab the situation.

77
00:11:45,122 --> 00:11:46,607
Passport and money.

78
00:11:46,707 --> 00:11:48,567
Shut your mouth, not deaf.

79
00:11:48,667 --> 00:11:51,653
Receive. Do something
I ask - you will receive.

80
00:11:51,753 --> 00:11:54,133
Next, have not yet departed.

00:16:12,848 --> 00:16:14,848
Like it?

82
00:16:40,918 --> 00:16:43,128
Clothing buy a normal one.

83
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:44,947
Then come back.

84
00:16:45,047 --> 00:16:49,134
The order of point-here ideal.
Then we'll talk.

85
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:51,370
Is that all?

86
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:54,785
Where the remaining money and passport?

87
00:17:06,485 --> 00:17:08,485
I'll pick eight.

88
00:17:59,121 --> 00:18:02,207
Hello? Who is it?

89
00:18:04,293 --> 00:18:08,046
Hello? Hello? Who is it?

90
00:18:08,046 --> 00:18:13,010
It's me, Galya. How are you?

91
00:18:15,554 --> 00:18:17,554
What do you want?

92
00:18:18,473 --> 00:18:21,935
Talk. Give me with her Please talk to.

93
00:18:26,732 --> 00:18:28,732
I'm going home.

94
00:18:29,401 --> 00:18:31,401
Why?

95
00:18:31,403 --> 00:18:33,403
I want to see it.

96
00:18:35,407 --> 00:18:37,407
Do not come here.

97
00:18:37,409 --> 00:18:39,959
'I told her that you are dead.

98
00:18:40,871 --> 00:18:44,750
Dad? What we have for dinner?

99
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:49,610
Lena, quieter. I'm talking on the phone.

100
00:18:50,589 --> 00:18:54,384
Please. Gimme talk to her.

101
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:06,032
You - my best worker.

102
00:22:08,203 --> 00:22:10,328
This work - the last one.

103
00:22:11,915 --> 00:22:13,915
But if I say 'no'?

104
00:22:14,668 --> 00:22:16,668
You promised.

105
00:22:17,004 --> 00:22:19,698
I wanted to mention human beings.

106
00:22:19,798 --> 00:22:21,838
With hummus, with vodka.

107
00:22:22,384 --> 00:22:24,384
You also can not wait.

108
00:22:26,346 --> 00:22:30,100
At. Two weeks.

109
00:22:31,685 --> 00:22:35,510
Not first class,
I'm sorry, but at the window.

110
00:22:36,607 --> 00:22:38,175
But where are the rest?

111
00:22:38,275 --> 00:22:42,446
Job done? Two days
come, get a passport, money.

112
00:22:44,114 --> 00:22:47,514
I'm tired already your sour face to see.

113

I also miss your will not.

114
00:22:53,624 --> 00:22:57,669
'Aerosvit' 238. Tel Aviv - Kiev.

115
00:23:47,261 --> 00:23:49,261
Music too loud.

116
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:03,945
Turn off the music, please.

117
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:09,155
Turn off the music now
same or I'll call the police.

118
00:24:19,334 --> 00:24:21,334
Back in the apartment.'

119
00:25:08,675 --> 00:25:10,885
What are you bothering me?

120
00:25:19,102 --> 00:25:22,648
Leave me alone.
I do not need your help.

121
00:26:24,126 --> 00:26:26,126
I need you for water.

122
00:26:27,296 --> 00:26:29,296
And for the fabric.

123
00:26:29,798 --> 00:26:31,798
What?

124
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:48,365
I do not have fabric, but I have
toilet paper, extra soft.

125
00:26:49,484 --> 00:26:52,034
This is the best that I found.

126
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,200
Do something to cook?

127
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:12,590
This noodle is very tasty.

128
00:27:13,717 --> 00:27:15,717
I love her.

129
00:27:16,929 --> 00:27:19,223
You just have to know how

130
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:22,543

131
00:27:22,643 --> 00:27:25,788
Well, how to jump it, well, you know.

132
00:27:26,355 --> 00:27:28,480
And prepare a good sauce.

133
00:27:28,524 --> 00:27:30,384
I am preparing for instruction.

134
00:27:30,484 --> 00:27:33,884
Yes, but these instructions do not work.

135
00:27:34,905 --> 00:27:37,795
These instructions are in Russian.

136
00:27:40,369 --> 00:27:42,369
He will soon return.

137
00:27:46,583 --> 00:27:49,218
If I'm not home, he gets angry.

138
00:27:49,336 --> 00:27:53,161
If he finds out that I'm here...
- So go away.

139
00:28:04,852 --> 00:28:06,852
Did you draw?

140
00:28:11,733 --> 00:28:13,733
It seems to Eilat.

141
00:28:14,778 --> 00:28:16,096
Eilat?

142
00:28:16,196 --> 00:28:19,741
Yes. This is a city in the south.

143
00:28:21,201 --> 00:28:23,201
Beautiful place.

144
00:28:27,499 --> 00:28:29,499
Listen.

145
00:28:30,377 --> 00:28:32,377
My husband, he

146
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:35,630
He was not always so.

147
00:28:37,050 --> 00:28:39,050
Sometimes it

148
00:28:41,722 --> 00:28:43,722
You know.
- Yes, I know.

149
00:28:46,852 --> 00:28:49,546
Sometimes he does not like as you cook,

150
00:28:49,646 --> 00:28:52,216
sometimes he failed day at work,

151
00:28:52,316 --> 00:28:57,096
sometimes too much to pay
accounts, sometimes the water is bad.

152
00:28:57,196 --> 00:28:59,196
Yes, I know.

153
00:29:04,328 --> 00:29:06,328
So, we normal?

154
00:29:07,414 --> 00:29:09,414
You are not to blame.

155
00:29:22,054 --> 00:29:24,519
You're a long time in Israel?

156
00:29:27,893 --> 00:29:29,753
Two.

157
00:29:29,853 --> 00:29:32,272
Do you speak Hebrew?

158
00:29:34,107 --> 00:29:36,107
Little.

159
00:29:37,194 --> 00:29:38,637
How are things?

160
00:29:38,737 --> 00:29:40,737
Damn.

161
00:29:41,365 --> 00:29:42,891
Fuck you to

162
00:29:42,991 --> 00:29:44,991
Excellent.

163
00:30:15,399 --> 00:30:17,524
I'll probably bother you?

164
00:30:17,776 --> 00:30:22,573
You're busy cooking and all that, so

165
00:30:22,573 --> 00:30:23,766
I have to go.

166
00:30:23,866 --> 00:30:25,866
You can take it.

167
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:28,145
What? No, what you do. No.

168
00:30:28,245 --> 00:30:30,245
No, I can not.

169
00:30:30,414 --> 00:30:34,494
It's not good, you do not know me.
- No, take it.

170
00:30:58,901 --> 00:31:00,901
This is better.

171
00:31:00,903 --> 00:31:02,903
This is worse.

172
00:31:04,865 --> 00:31:07,034
This, yes?

173
00:31:07,075 --> 00:31:08,685
This 'mivtsa. You know
what is a 'mitzvah'?

174
00:31:08,785 --> 00:31:15,042
One to buy, second for free.
If you take this, no 'mitzvah'.

175
00:31:15,792 --> 00:31:20,807
If so you eat this shit, so
at least not to overpay for him.

176
00:31:21,715 --> 00:31:24,350
Better when 'Mitzvah'. Come on.

177
00:31:25,719 --> 00:31:27,719
Where did you get it?

178
00:31:30,349 --> 00:31:33,627
Never, never take milk from the first row.

179
00:31:33,727 --> 00:31:34,711
Never.

180
00:31:34,811 --> 00:31:37,616
Always take it from the back row.

181
00:31:38,774 --> 00:31:41,193
See? Date of much better.

182
00:31:42,194 --> 00:31:45,097
You're here for two years
and do not know this?

183
00:31:45,197 --> 00:31:47,933
Come on, I put you in the express queue.

184
00:31:48,033 --> 00:31:50,923
Sorry, sorry, wait a minute.
Sorry.

185
00:31:51,495 --> 00:31:52,563
What? What's happening?

186
00:31:52,663 --> 00:31:54,732
Nothing, everything is in order.

187
00:31:54,832 --> 00:31:58,585
I work here. Only one minute, relax.

188
00:31:58,627 --> 00:32:00,627

Leave me alone, I cry.

194
00:32:24,444 --> 00:32:27,281
During all this? I must pay.

195
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:33,036
Say, do you like?

196
00:32:35,289 --> 00:32:40,219

197
00:32:42,921 --> 00:32:44,921
I like them.

198
00:32:53,056 --> 00:32:55,181

00:33:04,318 --> 00:33:07,803
A lovely girl, very beautiful.
I hate her.

203

Eleanor.

204
00:33:13,410 --> 00:33:15,410
As the song.

205
00:33:15,954 --> 00:33:23,003
Elinor. You are as beautiful as an angel.

206
00:33:28,342 --> 00:33:30,661
Are you familiar with the Zohar?

207
00:33:30,761 --> 00:33:32,761
What is the Zohar?

208
00:33:33,263 --> 00:33:35,728
The best singer in the world.

209
00:33:36,808 --> 00:33:39,103
You did not hear songbirds?

210
00:33:39,645 --> 00:33:41,645

'A flower in my garden' 'One I'll go.'

214
00:33:51,198 --> 00:33:53,578
You do not know these songs?

215
00:33:56,370 --> 00:33:59,189
Sister, you are two years in Israel
- And not heard

216
00:33:59,289 --> 00:34:02,519
even a little classical Israeli music?

217
00:34:05,087 --> 00:34:07,127
You have a lot to learn.

218
00:34:09,550 --> 00:34:11,718
I

219
00:34:11,927 --> 00:34:13,203
I

220
00:34:13,303 --> 00:34:15,597

fool.

223
00:34:20,394 --> 00:34:22,212
Correct.

224
00:34:22,312 --> 00:34:25,257
When you say something
that you do not like

225
00:34:25,357 --> 00:34:29,182
When you feel that you want
You look so idiot,

226
00:34:29,278 --> 00:34:34,038
you just look at them now
and say: 'Hey, I'm not a fool.'

227
00:34:35,617 --> 00:34:39,017
Then they will know you're not an idiot.

228
00:34:40,539 --> 00:34:42,919
Do you understand me, Ahote?

229
00:34:45,294 --> 00:34:47,796
Hey, I'm not a fool.

230
00:34:48,338 --> 00:34:49,281
Good.
- Yes?

231
00:34:49,381 --> 00:34:51,381
Yes.

232
00:35:25,083 --> 00:35:28,695
Do you see that high
curly hair, a light jacket.

233
00:35:28,795 --> 00:35:34,051
We quietly go out of
machine, go to the side entrance.

234
00:35:34,843 --> 00:35:36,537
There our people.

235
00:35:36,637 --> 00:35:38,637
He'll miss the quiet.

236
00:35:39,515 --> 00:35:41,250
You go inside.

237
00:35:41,350 --> 00:35:43,475
The crowd will find them.

238
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:46,813
So? You get to this 'Barbie'

239
00:35:47,606 --> 00:35:50,836
in red, a bullet in the forehead roll.

240
00:35:51,443 --> 00:35:53,443
Roney wants so.

241
00:35:54,696 --> 00:36:00,051
The best way to teach a lesson asshole
- Is to fill up his calf.

242
00:36:00,077 --> 00:36:02,077
Come on.

243
00:36:04,581 --> 00:36:06,581
Forward.

244
00:36:07,668 --> 00:36:10,963
Find someone else.
I will not do that.

245
00:36:11,713 --> 00:36:13,713
Do not start.

246
00:36:14,508 --> 00:36:17,052
Do what is said,
last order.

247
00:36:17,052 --> 00:36:20,831
Obtain a passport, documents
and fly on all four sides.

248
00:36:20,931 --> 00:36:22,931
Come on.

249
00:38:11,375 --> 00:38:13,375
You dancing?

250
00:38:15,170 --> 00:38:17,550
You can invite you to dance?

251
00:38:21,635 --> 00:38:23,635
Cigarette?

252
00:41:05,382 --> 00:41:08,272
See to it that this happens again.

253
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:12,220
It is clear, yes?

254
00:41:43,003 --> 00:41:44,738
Goodbye, Bear.

255
00:41:44,838 --> 00:41:45,948
Good luck.

256
00:41:46,048 --> 00:41:48,048
Then we'll talk.

257
00:41:59,019 --> 00:42:02,005
Well, I see you're not want me to leave.

258
00:42:02,105 --> 00:42:04,105
Moonlight.

259
00:42:04,149 --> 00:42:06,359
Barbie is still breathing.

260
00:42:07,402 --> 00:42:13,659
I finished my. I am flying home.
I you do nothing.

261
00:42:13,784 --> 00:42:18,705
Must. Must work to finish.

262
00:42:19,456 --> 00:42:21,358
Quiet, smooth, without tails.

263
00:42:21,458 --> 00:42:22,443
Here's what you must.

264
00:42:22,543 --> 00:42:25,446
I want my passport.
I want my money. I want to

You're like a little girl?

266
00:42:29,174 --> 00:42:32,119
A thousand times I tell you:
Roni and Michael - they are local.

267
00:42:32,219 --> 00:42:34,705
They - not me, they noggin different works.

268
00:42:34,805 --> 00:42:36,290

Bring your tea?

275
00:45:18,343 --> 00:45:21,828
You put your tea bag the eye, that helps.

276
00:45:22,264 --> 00:45:25,851
Yes, I know. I do not help.

277
00:45:34,443 --> 00:45:35,969
This voucher is worth
More than 20 shekels.

278
00:45:36,069 --> 00:45:38,555
Do you want to fill it with me?

279
00:45:38,655 --> 00:45:39,681

280
00:45:39,781 --> 00:45:44,620

00:45:52,544 --> 00:45:54,544
What choose?

283
00:45:55,297 --> 00:45:57,762
I think, Beer-Sheva easy win.

284
00:45:59,426 --> 00:46:01,891
Beer-Sheva had a good season.

285
00:46:04,056 --> 00:46:06,351
Now you are. You know what?

286
00:46:07,726 --> 00:46:10,629
Want me to enumerate you a list of games?

287
00:46:10,729 --> 00:46:12,729
I do not know the team.

288
00:46:13,315 --> 00:46:15,355
Better not to know them.

289
00:46:15,526 --> 00:46:19,861
In any case, it is a matter of luck.
So I come here.

290
00:46:21,782 --> 00:46:24,587
Here quietly.
You can concentrate.

291
00:46:26,453 --> 00:46:29,258
May get a little help from above.

292
00:46:35,587 --> 00:46:37,587
What, up there working?

293
00:46:40,634 --> 00:46:44,204
Once I had guessed seven
items. Won 20 NIS.

294
00:46:46,348 --> 00:46:48,643
But the best place for me -

295
00:46:49,768 --> 00:46:52,463
and not due to the fact that
I won something -

296
00:46:52,563 --> 00:46:57,651
but I just feel sort
communication, something real -

297
00:46:58,986 --> 00:47:00,262
a Mikveh.

298
00:47:00,362 --> 00:47:01,972
What?

299
00:47:02,072 --> 00:47:06,368
Mikveh. There comes all believers
Women ablution.

300
00:47:07,494 --> 00:47:10,831
It's like a big Religious pool.

301
00:47:14,251 --> 00:47:17,056
Every time I I go out after that,

302
00:47:18,172 --> 00:47:20,172
I got like a million.

303
00:47:22,384 --> 00:47:24,384

304
00:47:26,054 --> 00:47:29,199
He never hit me When I go from there.

305

Never.

306
00:47:34,271 --> 00:47:36,271
It cleanses you.

307
00:47:36,899 --> 00:47:39,109
This is something special.

308
00:47:41,487 --> 00:47:44,264
And under the water you can talk to God.

309
00:47:44,364 --> 00:47:46,364
Do not even believe it.

310
00:47:49,912 --> 00:47:53,142
And what would you do with that money?

311
00:47:54,625 --> 00:47:56,625

How are you.

315
00:48:11,642 --> 00:48:14,811
Moving to a new location
- Easy.

316
00:48:16,271 --> 00:48:18,271
A lot of problems.

317
00:48:19,358 --> 00:48:22,402
Problems? You know what I have.

They say all my fault.

326
00:48:54,142 --> 00:48:57,729
What should I be good, try to understand.

327
00:48:59,898 --> 00:49:01,898
I understand.

328
00:49:04,111 --> 00:49:07,171
I understand that I had to run away.

329
00:49:07,406 --> 00:49:10,200
Somewhere, anywhere.

330
00:49:11,827 --> 00:49:14,207
First of all, away from him.

331
00:49:16,874 --> 00:49:20,274
I can not let your child to suffer here.

332
00:49:26,466 --> 00:49:28,466

00:49:29,970 --> 00:49:33,455
No. He does not deserve In order to know.

334
00:49:36,143 --> 00:49:38,504
At this time I must do something.

335
00:49:38,604 --> 00:49:41,069
Otherwise, or he will kill me

336
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:45,400
or I'll kill him.

337
00:49:50,324 --> 00:49:51,683
And you?

369
00:52:09,004 --> 00:52:10,280
Girlfriends bred?

370
00:52:10,380 --> 00:52:12,074
It is not a friend, she was a neighbor.

371
00:52:12,174 --> 00:52:14,174
Talking about?

372
00:52:14,384 --> 00:52:16,764
She did not know, calm down.

373
00:52:18,430 --> 00:52:20,430
Seeds.

374
00:52:23,227 --> 00:52:25,312
Cool the seeds, please.

375
00:52:27,773 --> 00:52:30,342
She's taught me few words. She likes.

376
00:52:30,442 --> 00:52:32,442
Thank you.

377
00:52:34,154 --> 00:52:36,154
Like it?

378
00:52:37,407 --> 00:52:39,407
Pretty, right?

379
00:52:40,077 --> 00:52:44,039
As Mickey Khaimovich.

380
00:52:44,581 --> 00:52:46,581
Yes.

381
00:52:56,176 --> 00:52:59,847
Well, you probably want to talk

382
00:52:59,847 --> 00:53:03,475
and all that, but at I'm busy, so

383
00:53:04,142 --> 00:53:06,142
Then we'll talk.

384
00:53:21,743 --> 00:53:23,745
You instead of this?

385
00:53:24,329 --> 00:53:26,329
I'm tired look as hell.

386
00:53:28,041 --> 00:53:31,612
Do you have that, the roof gone?
I told you: finish the job.

387
00:53:31,712 --> 00:53:34,656
I had finished its work.
I want money and passport.

388
00:53:34,756 --> 00:53:37,493
Running in Ihilov, ended 'Barby' this.

389
00:53:37,593 --> 00:53:40,483
Kill myself, I do not touch women.

390
00:53:45,100 --> 00:53:47,100
Go away.

391
00:53:51,857 --> 00:53:54,359
Do you still have 48 hours.

392
00:53:55,194 --> 00:53:58,138
After that, I can not answer for you.

393
00:53:58,238 --> 00:54:00,238
Go away.

394
00:54:34,483 --> 00:54:40,239
My friend from work brought
image with ultrasound.

395
00:54:41,698 --> 00:54:43,698
So interesting.

396
00:54:46,870 --> 00:54:49,505
I'm glad that you came with me.

397
00:54:50,791 --> 00:54:53,681
We go to the hospital Ihilov, huh?

398
00:54:53,877 --> 00:54:58,549
Yes. I told you three times said. Here Ihilov.

399
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:11,560
I'll go to the toilet.

400
00:55:11,687 --> 00:55:13,687
All right.

401
00:56:31,517 --> 00:56:33,517
Look.

402
00:56:35,562 --> 00:56:37,562
We see the heart.

403
00:56:52,371 --> 00:56:54,371
As I have already seen?

404
00:56:55,457 --> 00:56:57,457
Tummy grew.

405
00:56:57,751 --> 00:57:00,028
Next month I'll look like a potato.

406
00:57:00,128 --> 00:57:02,508
Yes, you will look a potato.

407
00:57:03,423 --> 00:57:05,423
But feel like elephant.

408
00:57:06,552 --> 00:57:08,552
Yes go to hell.

409
00:57:10,764 --> 00:57:13,167
You have to end if you so I will draw.

410
00:57:13,267 --> 00:57:15,267
Let me see.

411
00:57:15,644 --> 00:57:17,644
Let me see.

412
00:58:23,795 --> 00:58:24,905
I want you drew me

413
00:58:25,005 --> 00:58:27,241
at the place which you told me.

414
00:58:27,341 --> 00:58:30,052
A place where women feel clean.

415
00:58:30,511 --> 00:58:32,511
What Mikveh?

416
00:58:32,804 --> 00:58:34,804
You never let go.

417
00:58:35,349 --> 00:58:38,239
This is only for married women and

418
00:58:38,393 --> 00:58:41,647
I'm pregnant, and me all these scars.

419
00:58:43,023 --> 00:58:45,023
I would not wasted.

420
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:55,200
Take me there.

421
00:58:56,328 --> 00:58:59,643
I want to feel clean as a normal woman.

422
00:59:19,143 --> 00:59:22,288
A month later you will be very heavy.

423
00:59:22,646 --> 00:59:27,066
If you ever pronounce
the word 'elephant', I swear, I

424
00:59:47,129 --> 00:59:49,129
I was... that's so big.

425
00:59:51,884 --> 00:59:53,702
Fr.

426
00:59:53,802 --> 00:59:55,496
Very sick of spin.

427
00:59:55,596 --> 00:59:57,596
Fr.

428
00:59:58,515 --> 01:00:00,515
I do not know.

429
01:00:00,559 --> 01:00:02,939
Yes, when you wear the child

430
01:00:03,353 --> 01:00:05,353
very sore back.

431
01:00:05,564 --> 01:00:08,550
I did not know that You have a child.

432
01:00:08,650 --> 01:00:10,650
Girl.

433
01:00:10,903 --> 01:00:11,887
Really?

434
01:00:11,987 --> 01:00:14,281
Yes, true. Why not?

435
01:00:14,531 --> 01:00:17,367
Never mind. I just do not know.

436
01:00:21,205 --> 01:00:23,500
Your daughter is in Russia?

437
01:00:24,541 --> 01:00:25,984
The Ukraine.

438
01:00:26,084 --> 01:00:30,172
And you came here to earn money for her?

439
01:00:40,057 --> 01:00:42,057
You're a good mother.

440
01:00:44,645 --> 01:00:45,921
I would have done the
same thing, you know.

441
01:00:46,021 --> 01:00:47,297
Do not touch him, put into place.

442
01:00:47,397 --> 01:00:48,549
Why is it?

443
01:00:48,649 --> 01:00:49,675
Listen, this is not your business.

444
01:00:49,775 --> 01:00:52,177
Do not bother my head, Galya.
Tell me the truth.

445
01:00:52,277 --> 01:00:54,277
Put into place.

446
01:00:57,658 --> 01:00:59,658
Teach me to use them.

447
01:01:00,786 --> 01:01:01,729
I'm serious.

448
01:01:01,829 --> 01:01:04,294
It is not for pregnant women.

449
01:01:04,331 --> 01:01:06,881
Give it to me, it's dangerous.

450
01:01:23,350 --> 01:01:25,350
This thing is so heavy.

451
01:01:26,228 --> 01:01:28,228
You did not answer me.

452
01:01:29,565 --> 01:01:30,716
Why did you hold?

453
01:01:30,816 --> 01:01:31,925
With this rain, and thunder
nobody can hear.

454
01:01:32,025 --> 01:01:34,820
You owe me for TV.
Plus console.

455
01:01:34,903 --> 01:01:37,113
You must answer me, Galya.

456
01:01:39,825 --> 01:01:45,095
Do not ask me questions, answers
which you do not want to know.

457
01:01:52,462 --> 01:01:55,032
If you do not want to tell me, fine.

458
01:01:55,132 --> 01:01:58,452
At the very least, teach me.
I want to know how they use it.

459
01:01:58,552 --> 01:02:00,120
It is not for women with a child.

460
01:02:00,220 --> 01:02:02,581
He will soon return, and if you teach me

461
01:02:02,681 --> 01:02:06,081
be strong like you perhaps he will stop.

462
01:02:06,310 --> 01:02:08,712
A waste of time it does not help.

463
01:02:08,812 --> 01:02:12,816
Wait, Galya. Teach me.
I want to know.

464
01:02:14,610 --> 01:02:20,220
A woman waiting for the child,
must know how to protect themselves.

465
01:02:32,169 --> 01:02:34,254
Two, three, four.

466
01:02:37,674 --> 01:02:41,499
So. Hit the mark
- This is not the main thing.

467
01:02:41,678 --> 01:02:44,568
First, you need learn not to fear.

468
01:02:44,973 --> 01:02:46,973
Hard to keep weapons.

469
01:02:47,559 --> 01:02:49,559
Hard.

470
01:02:49,561 --> 01:02:51,561
All right.

471
01:03:00,072 --> 01:03:02,199
Two, three, four.

472
01:03:05,869 --> 01:03:08,480
Fear not, fear not.
Aim straight, okay?

473
01:03:08,580 --> 01:03:12,192
Tighter, firmer hold
weapons. Solid and tight.

474
01:03:12,292 --> 01:03:13,318
But I cling.

475
01:03:13,418 --> 01:03:15,968
No, you hold it a little girl.

476
01:03:16,296 --> 01:03:18,296
Catch him as a woman.

477
01:03:19,341 --> 01:03:25,036
Do not let your arms to keep
, you should always keep their weapons.

478
01:03:27,891 --> 01:03:31,270
Two, three, four.

479
01:03:43,282 --> 01:03:45,322
Now teach me how to aim.

480
01:04:13,770 --> 01:04:15,770
Who are you talking to?

481
01:04:16,148 --> 01:04:18,148
From Tzipora.

482
01:04:19,359 --> 01:04:21,220
My regards to her sister.

483
01:04:21,320 --> 01:04:23,530
With best regards, sister.

484
01:04:24,031 --> 01:04:26,031
What's my drink?

485
01:04:26,492 --> 01:04:28,492
Coming soon.

486
01:04:28,577 --> 01:04:31,552
'Coming soon' you said an hour ago.

487
01:04:35,542 --> 01:04:36,652
Are you ready?

488
01:04:36,752 --> 01:04:38,752
Yes.

489
01:04:39,046 --> 01:04:41,532
You are estimates, as I told you?

490
01:04:41,632 --> 01:04:43,992
Last month at I had a week ago.

491
01:04:44,092 --> 01:04:49,107
Yes, because it is strictly... There
Poles are just obaldet.

492
01:04:55,395 --> 01:04:59,390
Give me a little of
ice cream, which you bought.

493
01:04:59,525 --> 01:05:01,525
All right.

494
01:05:03,237 --> 01:05:04,763
We can already do this?

495
01:05:04,863 --> 01:05:06,863
Soon.

496
01:05:08,158 --> 01:05:10,158
Are you talking about?

497
01:05:10,577 --> 01:05:13,467
Gorilla just woke up.
I have to go.

498
01:05:22,256 --> 01:05:23,323
So you brought your mother

499
01:05:23,423 --> 01:05:25,284
a lot of peace and joy, you hear?

500
01:05:25,384 --> 01:05:26,785
And many grandchildren.

501
01:05:26,885 --> 01:05:29,096
Thank you.
- Bye.

502
01:05:32,432 --> 01:05:35,492
Bless you Lord, the righteous woman.

503
01:05:35,936 --> 01:05:39,022
How nice that you came.
How are you?

504
01:05:39,022 --> 01:05:43,277
Thank God. I just...
hit my head against the wall.

505
01:05:44,111 --> 01:05:45,888
Share.

506
01:05:45,988 --> 01:05:47,848
I guess I can not pass in this form.

507
01:05:47,948 --> 01:05:49,948
It is not so scary.

508
01:05:53,287 --> 01:05:55,455
I'll see her friend.

509
01:05:56,874 --> 01:05:58,874
Are you married?

510
01:05:59,960 --> 01:06:01,960
She was engaged.

511
01:06:02,921 --> 01:06:05,783
Actually, I did not see the ring,
but oh well, the future bride.

512
01:06:05,883 --> 01:06:09,283
Let it be just luck.
When is the wedding?

513
01:06:10,971 --> 01:06:12,971
Two days.

514
01:06:13,640 --> 01:06:15,084
Pure seven days have passed?

515
01:06:15,184 --> 01:06:17,184
Yes, gone.

516
01:06:17,978 --> 01:06:20,103
What is your name, bride?

517
01:06:24,359 --> 01:06:27,446
Gal. Galia Rasimova.

518
01:06:35,537 --> 01:06:40,375
Mazal. Bring cake, the
us there's another bride.

519
01:06:45,464 --> 01:06:47,674
Perhaps it was a bad idea.

520
01:06:49,468 --> 01:06:52,188
Give me a hand. Of course, good.

521
01:06:54,848 --> 01:06:57,143
Such a thing is not for me.

522
01:06:58,060 --> 01:07:00,270
Do not worry, all is well.

523
01:07:01,188 --> 01:07:03,993
It's like diving naked in a pool.

524
01:07:04,483 --> 01:07:06,483
You're never done?

525
01:07:09,822 --> 01:07:12,287
Never, when God looked at me.

526
01:07:18,372 --> 01:07:20,372
I'm not going.

527
01:07:20,499 --> 01:07:22,501
Crazy? You wait.

528
01:07:23,418 --> 01:07:25,883
Not everyone can be cleansed.

529
01:07:26,046 --> 01:07:29,508
This is for good people.

530
01:07:32,177 --> 01:07:34,177
But you're a good man.

531
01:07:38,642 --> 01:07:43,147
He sees me and immediately
understand what I am dirty.

532
01:07:45,065 --> 01:07:47,530
Stop talking nonsense, Galya.

533
01:07:53,615 --> 01:07:55,742
I did many bad things.

534
01:07:57,035 --> 01:08:00,581
In the Ukraine, and here, too.

535
01:08:06,753 --> 01:08:12,759
But worst of all - this is
I dropped my daughter and husband.

536
01:08:16,180 --> 01:08:18,985
When my daughter was only a year,

537
01:08:22,769 --> 01:08:24,769
I just got up and left.

538
01:08:27,107 --> 01:08:29,107
What's her name?

539
01:08:31,862 --> 01:08:36,158
Elena. She is now five years old.

540
01:08:42,289 --> 01:08:44,289
Why did you cast her?

541
01:08:48,170 --> 01:08:50,170
She

542
01:08:53,967 --> 01:08:55,967
She was born wrong.

543
01:09:04,019 --> 01:09:06,019
Hey, it happens, Galya.

544
01:09:06,271 --> 01:09:08,271
It's not your fault.

545
01:09:09,650 --> 01:09:11,650
Just happens.

546
01:09:19,076 --> 01:09:23,496
The doctor said that she
lack of oxygen in the brain.

547
01:09:24,248 --> 01:09:28,158
What she will never
normal, like everyone else.

548
01:09:30,462 --> 01:09:32,239
All this because of me.

549
01:09:32,339 --> 01:09:34,339
Oh.

550
01:09:34,800 --> 01:09:36,326
It's my fault.

Stretch, stretch your fingers.

01:11:30,791 --> 01:11:31,775
Sweetheart, kindle his hands to the side,

01:11:31,875 --> 01:11:33,444
not touch to his body.

01:13:18,607 --> 01:13:20,342
Who is it?

573
01:13:20,442 --> 01:13:21,468
People with work.

574
01:13:21,568 --> 01:13:23,568
Go home.

575
01:13:27,574 --> 01:13:29,574

You said that the bus runs every hour.

581
01:15:01,668 --> 01:15:03,668
Let's go.

582
01:15:03,921 --> 01:15:06,824
What, like this? In the middle of the day?

583
01:15:06,924 --> 01:15:09,343
Let's go. Come on.

584
01:15:14,848 --> 01:15:17,084
If I leave, I can not go back.

585
01:15:17,184 --> 01:15:19,378

I told him. She told him about
child, he promised that will change.

590
01:15:39,206 --> 01:15:41,206
Child needs a father.

591
01:15:42,292 --> 01:15:43,569
I want to give him another chance.

592
01:15:43,669 --> 01:15:45,669
To do what?

593
01:15:47,047 --> 01:15:48,115

594
01:15:48,215 --> 01:15:50,215
To do what?

595
01:15:51,343 --> 01:15:56,749
Look at yourself. On its face,
on the scars. Their you can fix it.

596
01:15:56,849 --> 01:15:58,849
Child - no.

597

01:16:08,318 --> 01:16:10,318
They always promise.

And I do not know well
whether I'm doing good or bad.

604
01:16:56,700 --> 01:16:58,700
Forget about it.

605
01:16:59,495 --> 01:17:01,620
Far from it you are safe.

606
01:17:03,165 --> 01:17:05,165
He will find me.

I can feel it. He finds and kill me, I know.

For whom are you taking?
All you're doing - it is running away.

I do not leave you.

735
01:35:45,829 --> 01:35:49,314
These people do not otvyazhutsya from me.

736
01:35:49,458 --> 01:35:51,458
Gal, I will not leave.

737
01:35:52,044 --> 01:35:55,130
If we are going, you're going alone.
