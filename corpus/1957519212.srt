Time for your mother
and me to hit the road.

41
00:08:09,256 --> 00:08:10,858
Come on, dear, let's go.

42
00:08:10,891 --> 00:08:13,861
She can handle it, right, Mags?

43
00:08:15,262 --> 00:08:16,530
Love ya, kiddo.

44
00:08:16,564 --> 00:08:17,732
See you in a few days.

45
00:08:18,666 --> 00:08:21,235

Don't worry, sir, we'll find
him.

[suspenseful music]

54
00:09:52,359 --> 00:09:53,828
Follow me.

55
00:09:53,861 --> 00:09:55,062
Yes, sir.

[suspenseful music]

57
00:10:10,244 --> 00:10:11,078
Please, shut the door.

Yes, sir.

Hey look, Connor, I'm just
gonna get right after it.

62
00:10:17,818 --> 00:10:19,386
I got a call this morning
from Sarah Simmons

63
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:20,754
over there on Ridge road.

64
00:10:20,788 --> 00:10:22,823
Sarah Simmons, Bobby's wife?

65
00:10:22,857 --> 00:10:25,826
Yeah, Bobby didn't come home
last night.

66
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:27,228
She's worried sick about him.

67
00:10:27,995 --> 00:10:29,997
Now, you know it takes
about 24 hours for us

68
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:31,999
to generate a missing person's
report.

69
00:10:32,032 --> 00:10:34,001
I think with everything
going on around here,

70
00:10:34,034 --> 00:10:35,836
I need for you to get out there
ASAP

71
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:38,305
if we have any chance
of finding him alive.

72
00:10:38,339 --> 00:10:40,841
Yes, sir, me and Dave
will get right on it.

73
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:42,042
Hang on, there's more.

74
00:10:44,111 --> 00:10:46,680
I need you to take care of
Dave while he's out there.

75
00:10:48,115 --> 00:10:49,150
Sir?

76
00:10:49,183 --> 00:10:51,886
Now, Dave and Bobby were
old high school buddies.

77
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:53,120
I know my son.

78
00:10:53,154 --> 00:10:55,222
This might shake him up a bit.

79
00:10:55,256 --> 00:10:57,324
Yes, sir, anything you need.

80
00:10:58,058 --> 00:11:01,061
Now I know Dave can
be kind of an asshole,

81
00:11:01,095 --> 00:11:01,996
but you're doing a real good job

82
00:11:02,029 --> 00:11:04,131
of taking him under your wing.

83
00:11:04,165 --> 00:11:04,965
He doesn't have to know
everything

84
00:11:04,999 --> 00:11:08,836
while he's out there,
understand?

85
00:11:09,904 --> 00:11:10,771
Yes, sir.

86
00:11:13,841 --> 00:11:16,844

We have to get you a better
watch.

89
00:11:42,903 --> 00:11:44,004
Why, I have a phone.

90
00:11:44,738 --> 00:11:47,509
Nevermind, did you at
least check in this morning?

91
00:11:47,542 --> 00:11:48,510
Oh, my God, no.

92
00:11:48,543 --> 00:11:50,077
Hold up, it's fine.

93
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:51,145
I got you, it's fine.

94
00:11:51,812 --> 00:11:53,714
All right, so what're we doing
today?

95
00:11:59,853 --> 00:12:02,856
[suspenseful music]

96
00:12:03,891 --> 00:12:04,792
I know this guy.

97
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:07,094
Are you gonna be all
right to handle this?

98
00:12:07,127 --> 00:12:09,897
Yes, I'll be fine, damn.

99
00:12:11,065 --> 00:12:12,833
Look he's out there.

100
00:12:12,866 --> 00:12:13,867
They're all out there.

101
00:12:13,901 --> 00:12:14,768
We'll find them.

102
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:19,039
I do have a serious question
though.

103
00:12:19,073 --> 00:12:19,940
Shoot.

104
00:12:20,642 --> 00:12:23,310
Before we get started,
can we please get a coffee?

105
00:12:25,145 --> 00:12:26,847
You gotta be kidding me,
right?

Come on, buddy, come on.

112

That a boy, let's go, come on.

113
00:13:09,356 --> 00:13:12,493
Come on, let's go,
buddy, come on, let's go!

[mysterious music]

120
00:14:08,182 --> 00:14:09,383
How are they doing today?

121
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:11,952
Hungry as usual, very active.

122
00:14:11,985 --> 00:14:13,555
I hung their breakfast so
they would work for it,

123
00:14:13,588 --> 00:14:15,255
but they'd rather be hunting.

124
00:14:15,289 --> 00:14:16,457
[chuckles] That's good.

125
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:17,659
Wolves will be wolves.

126
00:14:17,692 --> 00:14:18,992
How are we doing on meat?

127
00:14:19,026 --> 00:14:20,327
Um, we're okay with the red
meat.

128
00:14:20,361 --> 00:14:21,596
Little light on the chicken.

129
00:14:21,629 --> 00:14:23,631
Probably could use a
little bit more rabbit.

130
00:14:23,665 --> 00:14:25,366
Oh, yeah, sure.

131
00:14:25,399 --> 00:14:27,134
[pencil scratching]

132
00:14:27,167 --> 00:14:28,369
Anything else?

133
00:14:28,402 --> 00:14:30,437
Yeah, see if you can check
into getting a mammoth for us.

134
00:14:30,471 --> 00:14:32,640
That should last us about a
month or two.

135
00:14:32,674 --> 00:14:33,874
Good idea [sighs].

136
00:14:37,512 --> 00:14:38,946
Stop it, Todd.

137
00:14:38,979 --> 00:14:40,914
[chuckles] Lighten up, Mags.

138
00:14:40,948 --> 00:14:42,550
You're gonna wear yourself out.

139
00:14:42,584 --> 00:14:44,586
Your parents enjoyed doing this
job.

140
00:14:44,619 --> 00:14:46,487
That's what you gotta do.

141
00:14:46,521 --> 00:14:48,055
You know what?

142
00:14:48,088 --> 00:14:49,056
What?

143
00:14:49,089 --> 00:14:51,392
It's been a whole year
since they've been gone.

144
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:54,995
I kinda had a feeling today
was gonna be a rough day.

145
00:14:55,028 --> 00:14:55,996
Well, I finally had the
courage

146
00:14:56,029 --> 00:14:58,232
to start going through
some of their things.

147
00:14:58,265 --> 00:15:00,668
You know, your parents,
they were good people.

148
00:15:01,636 --> 00:15:03,203
Dad was a genius.

149
00:15:03,237 --> 00:15:04,672
He knew so much about wolves,

150
00:15:04,706 --> 00:15:06,206
what they needed and when.

151
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,074
How to take care of them.

152
00:15:07,107 --> 00:15:09,544
It was like he was part of the
pack.

153
00:15:09,577 --> 00:15:11,679
There's lots to live up to.

154
00:15:11,713 --> 00:15:13,213
Give it time.

155
00:15:13,247 --> 00:15:15,382
That's easy for you to say.

156
00:15:15,416 --> 00:15:17,284
This burden hasn't passed on to
you.

157
00:15:18,485 --> 00:15:20,722
Hey, you're not in this alone,
okay?

158
00:15:20,755 --> 00:15:21,955
I was there for your parents.

159
00:15:21,989 --> 00:15:23,056
I'll be there for you.

160
00:15:24,191 --> 00:15:25,693
I know, Todd, thank you.

161
00:15:25,727 --> 00:15:29,430
[chuckles] Don't mess with
that, seriously, you're family.

162
00:15:29,463 --> 00:15:31,265
Oh, that actually reminds me.

163
00:15:31,298 --> 00:15:32,399
When I was going through Dad's
things,

164
00:15:32,433 --> 00:15:34,334
I finally got myself to look in
the bag

165
00:15:34,368 --> 00:15:36,036
that they found at the scene
that night.

166
00:15:36,069 --> 00:15:37,572
They gave you that stuff?
I thought that was evidence?

167
00:15:37,605 --> 00:15:39,339
No, they let me have it.

168
00:15:39,373 --> 00:15:42,009
Anyway, it's over there with
some of my dad's old stuff

169
00:15:42,042 --> 00:15:43,310
if you want anything.

170
00:15:43,343 --> 00:15:45,045
Anything good in there?

171
00:15:45,078 --> 00:15:47,414
Just his camera and some
hunting gear.

172
00:15:47,448 --> 00:15:49,082
Oh, actually, there was
something interesting,

173
00:15:49,116 --> 00:15:50,685
this old book.

174
00:15:50,718 --> 00:15:53,555
A book, what kind of book?

175
00:15:53,588 --> 00:15:55,055
[chuckles] Well, it's gotta be
old.

176
00:15:55,088 --> 00:15:56,023
I mean hard to say really.

177
00:15:56,056 --> 00:15:56,691
I don't know.

178
00:15:56,724 --> 00:15:57,559
I didn't read it yet.

179
00:15:57,592 --> 00:16:00,160
Why trouble yourself with that
stuff?

180
00:16:00,194 --> 00:16:01,995
It's a waste of time.

181
00:16:02,029 --> 00:16:04,131
Geez, Todd, who needs to
lighten up now?

182
00:16:05,466 --> 00:16:06,266
I'm sorry, Mags.

183
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,602
I'm just concerned about the
wolves

184
00:16:07,635 --> 00:16:09,369
and what were going through now.

185
00:16:09,403 --> 00:16:11,371
Can I show you something
out in the feeding pen?

186
00:16:11,405 --> 00:16:12,272
Yeah, sure.

187
00:16:16,109 --> 00:16:17,779
[sighs] This better not be
expensive.

188
00:16:17,812 --> 00:16:21,014
[suspenseful music]

189
00:16:28,322 --> 00:16:31,693
Look, I know this case may
be a little bit rough on you.

190
00:16:31,726 --> 00:16:34,061
Man, I'm fine, seriously.

191
00:16:34,094 --> 00:16:35,663
Okay, the Chief is really
worried

192
00:16:35,697 --> 00:16:37,097
about you digging in on this
one.

193
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:38,666
Yeah, telling you all this
stuff

194
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:40,200
while keeping me in the dark?

195
00:16:40,234 --> 00:16:42,135
Dude, he doesn't have
any confidence in me.

196
00:16:42,169 --> 00:16:44,806
Man, he's just a father
trying to protect his kid.

197
00:16:44,839 --> 00:16:46,541
All right, he's trying to
protect everybody in this town.

198
00:16:46,574 --> 00:16:49,042
We need to cut the guy a
little slack, don't you think?

199
00:16:49,076 --> 00:16:50,545
If you say so, man.

200
00:16:50,578 --> 00:16:51,779
Come on, Dave.

201
00:16:51,813 --> 00:16:54,214
I know he has high expectations
of you, but for good reason.

202
00:16:54,248 --> 00:16:57,050
Dude, the only reason I'm
involved in any of this stuff

203
00:16:57,084 --> 00:16:58,352
is because I'm your partner.

204
00:16:58,385 --> 00:17:00,187
I'm just here for the ride.

205
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:02,356
Come on, you bring a lot to
the table.

206
00:17:02,389 --> 00:17:03,390
Like what?

207
00:17:06,561 --> 00:17:09,764
Okay, Bobby, you and
him were friends, right?

208
00:17:09,797 --> 00:17:10,632
Right.

209
00:17:10,665 --> 00:17:11,566
Where would he be going?

210
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:12,634
What would he be doing?

211
00:17:12,667 --> 00:17:14,836
You mean besides drinking?

212
00:17:14,869 --> 00:17:16,771
Yes, Dave, besides drinking.

213
00:17:16,804 --> 00:17:18,272
I don't know.

214
00:17:18,305 --> 00:17:19,641
I know he liked to fish.

215
00:17:19,674 --> 00:17:22,276
Fishing, well, there you go.

216
00:17:23,277 --> 00:17:24,679
Did a little detective work.

217
00:17:24,712 --> 00:17:25,880
If he liked to fish,

218
00:17:25,914 --> 00:17:27,715
he'd have to pass by Frank's
to pick up supplies, right?

219
00:17:27,749 --> 00:17:30,317
Let's go by there and see
if Frank seen anything.

220
00:17:31,285 --> 00:17:34,288
[suspenseful music]

221
00:17:44,766 --> 00:17:46,466
[door thuds]
[bell rings]

222
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:47,735
Hey, how's it going there,
Frank?

223
00:17:47,769 --> 00:17:49,369
Oh, hey, Connor.

224
00:17:51,773 --> 00:17:53,775
What can I do for ya?

225
00:17:53,808 --> 00:17:55,208
Frank, we got a call this
morning.

226
00:17:55,242 --> 00:17:58,245
Oh, was it about all
those folks going crazy

227
00:17:58,278 --> 00:18:00,548
and buying up all my inventory?

228
00:18:00,582 --> 00:18:01,849
I mean look at that.

229
00:18:01,883 --> 00:18:04,418
They bought up all the toilet
paper.

230
00:18:05,118 --> 00:18:07,755
Of all the things you'd think.

231
00:18:07,789 --> 00:18:10,324
No, Frank, it wasn't
about your toilet paper.

232
00:18:10,357 --> 00:18:11,793
I mean, that is weird though.

233
00:18:11,826 --> 00:18:13,460
Tell me about it.

234
00:18:13,493 --> 00:18:15,195
Frank, we're looking for Bobby
Simmons.

235
00:18:15,228 --> 00:18:16,129
We have reason to believe

236
00:18:16,163 --> 00:18:17,665
that he might've been by here
yesterday

237
00:18:17,699 --> 00:18:19,433
buying some fishing supplies.

238
00:18:19,466 --> 00:18:20,535
Have you seen him?

239
00:18:20,568 --> 00:18:25,472
Bobby Simmons, no, I can't
say that I have, sorry.

240
00:18:25,506 --> 00:18:26,708
Are you sure?

241
00:18:26,741 --> 00:18:30,912
I keep an eye on everybody
that comes in this place, okay?

242
00:18:30,945 --> 00:18:33,648
You never know if one
of those little fuckers

243
00:18:33,681 --> 00:18:35,415
might be that killer that's on
the loose.

244
00:18:35,449 --> 00:18:36,383
You know what I'm saying?

245
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:39,754
Frank, come on, there's no
killer, okay?

246
00:18:39,787 --> 00:18:42,255
Just a few missing people,
that's all.

247
00:18:42,289 --> 00:18:44,559
I suppose Bobby's the next on
that list?

248
00:18:44,592 --> 00:18:46,527
Didn't say that either, Frank.

249
00:18:46,561 --> 00:18:48,161
I don't know.

250
00:18:48,195 --> 00:18:50,397
I've never seen people so
scared,

251
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:51,866
and they're buying up all this
stuff,

252
00:18:51,899 --> 00:18:53,601
and locking themselves in their
houses.

253
00:18:53,635 --> 00:18:54,802
That's just not right.

254
00:18:54,836 --> 00:18:57,505
Frank, we're gonna
get to the bottom of it.

255
00:18:57,538 --> 00:19:00,340
You know, hearing you say
that,

256
00:19:00,374 --> 00:19:03,210
doesn't fill me with
one iota of confidence

257
00:19:03,243 --> 00:19:06,246
that this situation is gonna
get taken care of anytime soon.

258
00:19:06,279 --> 00:19:08,348
All right, Frank, let's calm
down.

259
00:19:08,382 --> 00:19:11,284
We have people working around
the clock on this, all right?

260
00:19:11,318 --> 00:19:13,655
[door thuds]
[bell rings]

261
00:19:13,688 --> 00:19:15,288
Can I help you, miss?

262
00:19:15,322 --> 00:19:17,424
I'm looking for my
husband, Bobby Simmons.

263
00:19:17,457 --> 00:19:19,226
Thought he might've stopped in
here.

264
00:19:19,259 --> 00:19:20,160
Well, I'll be.

265
00:19:20,193 --> 00:19:22,429
So are these fine gentlemen
right here.

266
00:19:22,462 --> 00:19:24,599
Hi, Sarah, I'm Detective Ryan.

267
00:19:24,632 --> 00:19:25,600
You may know my partner, Dave.

268
00:19:25,633 --> 00:19:26,601
Yeah, I know Dave.

269
00:19:26,634 --> 00:19:27,467
[Frank groans]

270
00:19:27,502 --> 00:19:28,936
What's going on?

271
00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:31,304
We were actually on
our way to come see you.

272
00:19:32,339 --> 00:19:33,473
Okay.

273
00:19:33,508 --> 00:19:34,307
[Frank groans]

274
00:19:34,341 --> 00:19:36,443
Hey, Frank, can you give us a
sec?

275
00:19:37,578 --> 00:19:40,347
Sure, go ahead, help yourself.

276
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:42,950
It's not like you don't have
an office about six doors down

277
00:19:42,984 --> 00:19:44,819
where you can conduct your
business.

278
00:19:48,589 --> 00:19:50,424
Sarah, we were assigned

279
00:19:50,457 --> 00:19:51,993
to your husband's case this
morning.

280
00:19:52,026 --> 00:19:53,695
I don't understand.

281
00:19:53,728 --> 00:19:56,396
They told me it had to
be at least 24 hours

282
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:58,966
before anyone could do
anything, what's wrong?

283
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,902
Well, that's usually
the case, all right,

284
00:20:00,935 --> 00:20:02,570
but as you know, Dave and Bobby

285
00:20:02,603 --> 00:20:03,905
were good friends in high
school,

286
00:20:03,938 --> 00:20:05,940
and he wanted to get a jump on
this one.

287
00:20:06,841 --> 00:20:07,709
Hey.

288
00:20:08,743 --> 00:20:10,410
Hello.

289
00:20:10,444 --> 00:20:12,513
What can you tell us, Sarah,
that might help us find him?

290
00:20:12,547 --> 00:20:13,881
Where would he be going?

291
00:20:13,915 --> 00:20:15,583
What would he be doing?

292
00:20:15,616 --> 00:20:16,450
His sorry ass is probably

293
00:20:16,483 --> 00:20:18,553
passed out drunk somewhere in
the mud.

294
00:20:18,586 --> 00:20:20,555
[chuckles] That does
sound like the Bobby I knew.

295
00:20:20,588 --> 00:20:23,591
This one time we found him
passed out on the floor of the...

296
00:20:27,528 --> 00:20:29,429
Now let's calm down here.

297
00:20:29,463 --> 00:20:30,765
Take a deep breath.

298
00:20:30,798 --> 00:20:31,833
What can you tell us, Sarah?

299
00:20:31,866 --> 00:20:33,668
He might be the town drunk,

300
00:20:33,701 --> 00:20:36,838
but he's a good man, a good man.

301
00:20:37,739 --> 00:20:40,942
Yes, nobody said anything
differently.

302
00:20:40,975 --> 00:20:42,910
What happened last night?

303
00:20:42,944 --> 00:20:45,546
I already told the guy
on the phone earlier.

304
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:47,014
I understand, ma'am,

305
00:20:47,048 --> 00:20:49,517
but it would really help me
if I could hear it again.

306
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:52,520
[suspenseful music]

307
00:20:53,621 --> 00:20:56,758
[sighs] So, last night him and
I,

308
00:20:56,791 --> 00:20:59,359
well, we kinda got into a little
argument,

309
00:20:59,392 --> 00:21:01,428
but then he stormed off in his
truck,

310
00:21:01,461 --> 00:21:03,463
and said he needed to blow off
some steam.

311
00:21:03,497 --> 00:21:06,433
Okay, it's okay, it's okay.

312
00:21:06,466 --> 00:21:09,336
What made you think to look for
him here?

313
00:21:09,369 --> 00:21:11,438
Well, if he's not out
drinking at the fuckin' bar,

314
00:21:12,106 --> 00:21:13,373
he's usually fishing.

315
00:21:15,543 --> 00:21:17,477
Okay, Sarah, that helps a lot.

316
00:21:17,512 --> 00:21:19,614
All right, there's only
a few spots on that river

317
00:21:19,647 --> 00:21:20,648
he can get to at night.

318
00:21:20,681 --> 00:21:21,716
Won't you just go on home.

319
00:21:21,749 --> 00:21:23,718
Me and Dave will go around
there and take a look.

320
00:21:23,751 --> 00:21:25,686
If we find anything,
we'll give you a call.

321
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:26,754
Does that sound good?

322
00:21:28,589 --> 00:21:29,991
Yeah, good idea.

323
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,028
Thank you.

324
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:36,564
You're welcome.

325
00:21:36,597 --> 00:21:40,902
[bell rings]
[door thuds]

326
00:21:40,935 --> 00:21:43,938
[suspenseful music]

327
00:22:01,856 --> 00:22:03,624
Oh, shit, there's Bobby's
truck.

328
00:22:04,759 --> 00:22:07,762
[suspenseful music]

329
00:22:20,675 --> 00:22:22,043
Oh, my God, that stinks.

330
00:22:22,076 --> 00:22:22,910
What is that?

331
00:22:22,944 --> 00:22:25,947
[suspenseful music]

332
00:22:31,185 --> 00:22:32,720
Oh, Jesus, nasty!

333
00:22:32,753 --> 00:22:35,623
[mouse squeaking]

334
00:22:41,095 --> 00:22:42,697
Yeah, he's not there either.

335
00:22:43,598 --> 00:22:45,967
[mouse squeaking]

336
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,635
Let's go down this way.

337
00:22:47,668 --> 00:22:49,402
Yeah, let's do that.

338
00:22:49,436 --> 00:22:52,106
[mouse squeaking]

339
00:22:55,977 --> 00:22:58,980
[suspenseful music]

340
00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:16,731
All right, listen.

341
00:23:19,499 --> 00:23:20,467
There's two trails.

342
00:23:21,468 --> 00:23:23,537
You're gonna go down that way.

343
00:23:23,571 --> 00:23:25,072
I'm gonna go down this way.

344
00:23:25,106 --> 00:23:26,908
All right.

345
00:23:26,941 --> 00:23:29,944
[suspenseful music]

346
00:24:34,041 --> 00:24:38,212
Oh, shit, Connor, Connor,
Connor, Connor!

347
00:24:46,654 --> 00:24:47,788
Son of a bitch.

348
00:24:51,659 --> 00:24:52,526
What is that?

349
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:55,863
[suspenseful music]

350
00:24:55,896 --> 00:24:57,832
Christ, dude, he's been torn
apart!

351
00:24:57,865 --> 00:25:00,101
Easy, calm down.

352
00:25:00,134 --> 00:25:02,003
Assess the situation.

353
00:25:02,036 --> 00:25:03,237
What's missing here?

354
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:04,739
His leg!

355
00:25:04,772 --> 00:25:06,774
Yeah, Dave, I know his leg,
but look.

356
00:25:06,807 --> 00:25:08,943
There's no flies, maggots,
nothing.

357
00:25:08,976 --> 00:25:10,277
Maggots, what does that
have to do with anything?

358
00:25:10,311 --> 00:25:13,714
Bobby's truck, they were full
of them.

359
00:25:13,748 --> 00:25:16,017
Look at this, there's nothing.

360
00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:17,785
This kill is just a few hours
old.

361
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:23,257
And this, does that look
like a coyote print to you?

362
00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:25,693
No, dude, that would
be a big ass coyote!

363
00:25:27,995 --> 00:25:30,297
Hey, Dave, do you remember
that girl last summer.

364
00:25:30,331 --> 00:25:31,766
You mean the wolf girl?

365
00:25:31,799 --> 00:25:33,567
Yeah, Dave, the wolf girl.

366
00:25:33,601 --> 00:25:35,569
I think we should call
her and get her up here.

367
00:25:35,603 --> 00:25:37,038
Oh, Jesus.

368
00:25:37,071 --> 00:25:38,606
Are you okay?

369
00:25:38,639 --> 00:25:40,574
No, dude, before we had

370
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:42,076
just a bunch of missing person
reports.

371
00:25:42,109 --> 00:25:43,911
I figured eventually they
would just turn back up,

372
00:25:43,944 --> 00:25:44,912
and now we have this,

373
00:25:44,945 --> 00:25:46,147
and you're talking about wolves?

374
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:47,681
Calm the fuck down!

375
00:25:47,715 --> 00:25:49,817
This is the job you signed up
for!

376
00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:50,618
Now, do me a favor!

377
00:25:50,651 --> 00:25:52,953
Go back there and call Dr.
Keely!

378
00:25:52,987 --> 00:25:53,654
Dr. Keely?

379
00:25:53,687 --> 00:25:55,156
The fuckin' coroner, Dave!

380
00:25:55,189 --> 00:25:56,057
Okay!

381
00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:10,638
Okay.

382
00:26:15,242 --> 00:26:18,679
[Maggie sighs]

383
00:26:18,712 --> 00:26:19,613
Shit.

384
00:26:22,783 --> 00:26:25,619
[Maggie scoffs]

385
00:26:25,653 --> 00:26:28,656
[suspenseful music]

386
00:26:45,372 --> 00:26:48,109
[phone ringing]

387
00:26:50,077 --> 00:26:51,112
Maggie Talbot.

388
00:26:51,145 --> 00:26:53,114
Miss Talbot, this is Detective
Ryan

389
00:26:53,147 --> 00:26:55,082
at Mantua Police Department.

390
00:26:55,116 --> 00:26:56,750
Connor?

391
00:26:56,784 --> 00:26:58,152
You remember?

392
00:26:58,185 --> 00:26:59,854
What can I do for you?

393
00:26:59,887 --> 00:27:02,756
Maggie, it seems that we
have another animal attack.

394
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:03,424
And you're calling me?

395
00:27:03,457 --> 00:27:05,159
You must think it's a wolf.

396
00:27:05,192 --> 00:27:06,961
I don't know to be honest with
you.

397
00:27:06,994 --> 00:27:08,996
There's a lot about this
case I don't understand.

398
00:27:09,029 --> 00:27:11,098
I could really use your
insight on this one.

399
00:27:11,765 --> 00:27:13,834
Well, wolves haven't
been seen in the wild

400
00:27:13,868 --> 00:27:17,071
in this part of the country for
decades.

401
00:27:17,104 --> 00:27:18,839
I'll leave out the details for
now,

402
00:27:18,873 --> 00:27:20,074
but it's pretty violent.

403
00:27:20,107 --> 00:27:23,043
Okay, you know wolves are
highly misunderstood creatures,

404
00:27:23,077 --> 00:27:26,213
and very rarely attack
humans, I mean [chuckles].

405
00:27:26,247 --> 00:27:28,215
Yes, ma'am, I understand,

406
00:27:28,249 --> 00:27:30,885
but there's really something
off about this one.

407
00:27:30,918 --> 00:27:32,753
You could have coywolves.

408
00:27:32,786 --> 00:27:33,821
What's a coywolf?

409
00:27:34,523 --> 00:27:36,457
It's a crossbreed between
a coyote and a wolf.

410
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:39,126
You know wolves have been known
to cross with other species.

411
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,427
That can actually happen?

412
00:27:40,461 --> 00:27:41,630
Yeah, of course.

413
00:27:41,662 --> 00:27:43,397
I mean I'd have to see the
evidence to know for sure, but.

414
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:46,267
Well, listen, this
is out of my skill set.

415
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:48,002
Are you available to come take a
look?

416
00:27:48,035 --> 00:27:48,969
Sure [chuckles].

417
00:27:50,237 --> 00:27:51,372
How soon could you get here?

418
00:27:51,405 --> 00:27:52,574
Um, not long.

419
00:27:52,607 --> 00:27:55,309
I just have to pack a few
things and I'll be on my way.

420
00:27:55,342 --> 00:27:57,444
Sounds good, thank you.

421
00:27:57,478 --> 00:27:58,879
[Maggie chuckles]

422
00:27:58,913 --> 00:28:01,916
[suspenseful music]

423
00:28:02,816 --> 00:28:05,920
[chuckles] Hmm.

424
00:28:05,953 --> 00:28:08,956
[suspenseful music]

425
00:28:21,335 --> 00:28:24,138
[car door thuds]

426
00:28:26,307 --> 00:28:27,241
Hold it, hold up!

427
00:28:27,274 --> 00:28:29,210
- What's going on?
- The police down in Mantua

428
00:28:29,243 --> 00:28:31,478
think that someone was attacked
by a wolf.

429
00:28:31,513 --> 00:28:33,380
A wolf in that area, bullshit.

430
00:28:33,414 --> 00:28:34,448
That's what the man said.

431
00:28:34,481 --> 00:28:35,482
You want me to come with you?

432
00:28:35,517 --> 00:28:37,017
No, it's probably just a
coyote,

433
00:28:37,051 --> 00:28:39,019
but just in case I'm gonna check
it out.

434
00:28:39,053 --> 00:28:40,354
I should come with you, hold
on.

435
00:28:40,387 --> 00:28:41,288
Let me get a few things, all
right?

436
00:28:41,322 --> 00:28:42,524
No, no, Todd, don't worry
about it.

437
00:28:42,557 --> 00:28:43,224
I got this.

438
00:28:43,257 --> 00:28:44,959
You stay here with the wolves.

439
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:48,195
Don't go chasing that legend.

440
00:28:48,229 --> 00:28:50,130
Legend, what're you talking
about?

441
00:28:52,132 --> 00:28:54,335
Nothing, just be careful.

442
00:28:54,368 --> 00:28:56,538
In fact, take this.

443
00:28:56,571 --> 00:28:58,339
Come on, I don't need a gun.

444
00:28:58,372 --> 00:29:00,374
No, seriously, please, take
it.

445
00:29:02,977 --> 00:29:04,411
Fine.

446
00:29:04,445 --> 00:29:06,213
[gun clicks]

447
00:29:06,247 --> 00:29:07,915
I'll be back in a day or two,
okay?

448
00:29:10,050 --> 00:29:13,354
[car engine humming]

449
00:29:13,387 --> 00:29:16,390
[suspenseful music]

450
00:29:22,597 --> 00:29:24,164
Oh, man.

451
00:29:24,198 --> 00:29:27,067
[papers rustling]

452
00:29:32,473 --> 00:29:36,443
[camera shutter clicking]

453
00:29:36,477 --> 00:29:39,480
[suspenseful music]

454
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:01,368
Hey, Connor!

455
00:30:01,402 --> 00:30:03,937
[camera shutter clicking]

456
00:30:03,971 --> 00:30:05,472
What the fuck is wrong with
you?

457
00:30:05,507 --> 00:30:07,041
[chuckles] You look good on
camera, man.

458
00:30:07,074 --> 00:30:08,610
You could be one of
those outdoorsy models.

459
00:30:08,643 --> 00:30:09,476
You know what?

460
00:30:09,511 --> 00:30:10,177
One minute you're pissing your
pants.

461
00:30:10,210 --> 00:30:13,213
Next you're a fuckin' paparazzi.

462
00:30:14,649 --> 00:30:17,184
I swear you have multi
personalities.

463
00:30:17,217 --> 00:30:20,220
[suspenseful music]

464
00:30:48,916 --> 00:30:52,019
[object thuds]

465
00:30:52,052 --> 00:30:53,287
[engine roaring]

466
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:56,056
[truck horn blowing]

467
00:30:56,090 --> 00:30:59,093
[suspenseful music]

468
00:31:40,535 --> 00:31:43,538
[light piano music]

469
00:31:50,545 --> 00:31:53,414
[car door thuds]

[knocking on door]

[haunting choral music]

473
00:32:08,395 --> 00:32:11,131
[door creaking]

474
00:32:14,669 --> 00:32:16,236
I knew it.

475
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:17,438
I'm so sorry.

476
00:32:17,471 --> 00:32:20,140
[Sarah crying]

477
00:32:22,610 --> 00:32:25,112
[haunting choral music]

478
00:32:25,145 --> 00:32:27,281
Check this out.

479
00:32:27,314 --> 00:32:28,315
Scandal.

480
00:32:28,348 --> 00:32:30,250
I know, right?

481
00:32:30,284 --> 00:32:31,452
What do you think they're
saying?

482
00:32:31,485 --> 00:32:33,187
Something messy, that's for
sure.

483
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:35,055
Definitely, and she's all
like,

484
00:32:35,088 --> 00:32:37,692
"You have to leave before my
loser husband comes home."

485
00:32:37,725 --> 00:32:39,627
Yeah, and he's like,
"You're totally right, babe.

486
00:32:39,661 --> 00:32:41,295
"That dude totally sucks."

487
00:32:41,328 --> 00:32:42,329
"We can't keep doing this.

488
00:32:42,362 --> 00:32:44,465
"It's just [sighs], too much."

489
00:32:44,498 --> 00:32:45,767
"Fine, if you want it that
way,

490
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:48,135
"I'll take this fine ass
somewhere else."

491
00:32:48,168 --> 00:32:49,504
[both giggle]

492
00:32:49,537 --> 00:32:51,138
Oh, shit, I think he heard us.

493
00:32:51,171 --> 00:32:53,608
Relax, can't hear us from
all the way over there.

494
00:32:55,075 --> 00:32:56,511
Ah, could he?

495
00:32:56,544 --> 00:32:57,377
[both chuckle]

496
00:32:57,411 --> 00:32:58,479
Fuck, he did.

497
00:32:58,513 --> 00:33:01,281
That dude has incredible
hearing.

498
00:33:01,315 --> 00:33:03,350
And an incredible ass.

499
00:33:03,383 --> 00:33:05,687
Oh, please, he's so out of our
league.

500
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:07,522
Speak for yourself, sister.

501
00:33:09,757 --> 00:33:11,158
Look, look, watch.

502
00:33:11,191 --> 00:33:12,594
[both chuckle]

503
00:33:12,627 --> 00:33:13,528
Damn.

504
00:33:13,561 --> 00:33:16,564
[suspenseful music]

505
00:33:40,688 --> 00:33:41,756
[door thuds]

506
00:33:41,789 --> 00:33:44,792
[suspenseful music]

507
00:33:46,594 --> 00:33:47,427
Can I help you, miss?

508
00:33:47,461 --> 00:33:49,263
Yes, I'm here to see Detective
Ryan.

509
00:33:49,296 --> 00:33:50,497
He's expecting me.

510
00:33:50,532 --> 00:33:51,599
And who should I say is here?

511
00:33:51,633 --> 00:33:52,567
Maggie Talbot.

512
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:54,234
Okay, ah, just take a seat,
Miss Talbot.

513
00:33:54,268 --> 00:33:56,069
He'll be out in just a few
moments.

514
00:33:58,372 --> 00:34:00,407
You have a Maggie Talbot here to
see you.

515
00:34:06,246 --> 00:34:07,080
Miss Talbot.

516
00:34:07,114 --> 00:34:08,181
Please call me Maggie.

517
00:34:08,215 --> 00:34:09,851
Of course, thank you for
coming by.

518
00:34:09,884 --> 00:34:10,752
Come on back.

519
00:34:16,423 --> 00:34:17,759
So Maggie how is it you
have so much knowledge

520
00:34:17,792 --> 00:34:18,693
in this field?

521
00:34:18,726 --> 00:34:20,762
I mean, to be completely honest
with you,

522
00:34:20,795 --> 00:34:22,530
a lot of people thought
you were crazy last year

523
00:34:22,564 --> 00:34:24,398
looking for wolves in Ohio.

524
00:34:24,431 --> 00:34:25,867
[chuckles] Well, it's
in the family business.

525
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:27,434
My parents raised me in this
life.

526
00:34:27,467 --> 00:34:29,303
So they help you with this?

527
00:34:30,337 --> 00:34:31,706
Ah, not anymore, no.

528
00:34:33,575 --> 00:34:35,275
Off the better things, I
guess.

529
00:34:36,711 --> 00:34:37,745
Ah, not exactly.

530
00:34:37,779 --> 00:34:40,815
Last year, we lost on an
expedition in Alaska, so.

531
00:34:41,916 --> 00:34:44,284
Oh, Maggie, I...

532
00:34:44,318 --> 00:34:45,452
No, I mean, it's not your
fault.

533
00:34:45,485 --> 00:34:46,754
They were actually up there

534
00:34:46,788 --> 00:34:49,156
looking for wolf pack territory
patterns

535
00:34:49,189 --> 00:34:50,892
when they both went missing.

536
00:34:50,925 --> 00:34:53,728
I am so sorry, really.

537
00:34:53,761 --> 00:34:56,463
It seems like you have a lot
of resilience carrying on.

538
00:34:56,496 --> 00:34:57,331
Well, the conservation
center's

539

what keeps their legacy alive
for me.

540
00:34:59,433 --> 00:35:00,835
Of course, I understand.

541
00:35:04,204 --> 00:35:06,608
Well, I don't wanna take
up too much of your time,

542
00:35:07,709 --> 00:35:09,142
but here's some of the tufts of
hair

543
00:35:09,176 --> 00:35:11,378
that we found around the body.

544
00:35:11,411 --> 00:35:12,279
The body?

545
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:14,348
I didn't mention it?

546
00:35:14,381 --> 00:35:15,817
No, you said there was an
animal attack.

547
00:35:15,850 --> 00:35:17,284
You thought it was wolves.

548
00:35:18,418 --> 00:35:20,922
Well, technically you said
wolves.

549
00:35:20,955 --> 00:35:24,759
Semantics, I think we're
getting off track here.

550
00:35:24,792 --> 00:35:27,160
Yeah, you're right.

551
00:35:27,194 --> 00:35:29,530
Is there anything else to show
me here?

552
00:35:29,564 --> 00:35:33,367
Yes, actually I found
some interesting remains.

553
00:35:34,969 --> 00:35:36,571
This doesn't make any sense.

554
00:35:37,337 --> 00:35:39,339
Wolves don't really attack
people.

555
00:35:39,373 --> 00:35:40,775
Not to mention they've all been
eradicated

556
00:35:40,808 --> 00:35:42,710
from the lower 48.

557
00:35:42,744 --> 00:35:44,746
It's just hard to believe a
pack large enough to do this

558
00:35:44,779 --> 00:35:46,346
would go undetected.

Am I interrupting anything?

561
00:35:59,459 --> 00:36:01,663
Maggie, I think you
know my partner, Dave.

562
00:36:01,696 --> 00:36:02,530
Yeah, of course.

563
00:36:02,563 --> 00:36:03,531
Nice to see you again.

564
00:36:03,564 --> 00:36:06,668
Likewise, so what do
you make of all this?

565
00:36:06,701 --> 00:36:07,669
I'm not sure yet.

566
00:36:07,702 --> 00:36:09,236
I mean, I have to see
more evidence of wolves

567
00:36:09,269 --> 00:36:10,705
to make a determination.

568
00:36:10,738 --> 00:36:13,206
Dave, did you process
the photos of Bobby yet?

569
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:16,343
[chuckles] No, no, but you can
take her

570
00:36:16,376 --> 00:36:18,478
to go see the body in person,
can't you?

571
00:36:18,513 --> 00:36:19,614
That's a good idea.

572
00:36:19,647 --> 00:36:21,248
Would you be up to that, Maggie?

573
00:36:21,281 --> 00:36:22,717
Sure.

574
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:25,720
I think I'll stay here and
finish processing the evidence.

575
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:28,790

Hi, Dr. Keely.

579
00:36:51,478 --> 00:36:53,614
This is Maggie Talbot
from the Wolf sanctuary.

580
00:36:53,648 --> 00:36:54,916
Oh, yes, nice to meet you,
Maggie.

581
00:36:54,949 --> 00:36:56,718
Forgive me for not shaking your
hand.

582
00:36:56,751 --> 00:36:57,752
Oh, no problem.

583
00:36:59,286 --> 00:37:03,290
Well, since we're all
here, brace yourself.

584
00:37:03,323 --> 00:37:03,991
It's not pretty.

[suspenseful music]

586
00:37:09,429 --> 00:37:13,366
You can clearly see the teeth
marks here,

587
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:16,738
but not on the leg where you
might expect.

588
00:37:16,771 --> 00:37:18,940
It's more of a tear than a bite
here.

589
00:37:22,375 --> 00:37:23,711
Are you okay, Maggie?

590
00:37:23,745 --> 00:37:25,613
[clears throat] Yeah, I'm
fine.

591
00:37:25,646 --> 00:37:28,049
There's just something
really strange about this.

592
00:37:28,082 --> 00:37:30,383
It looks like a straight kill.

593
00:37:30,417 --> 00:37:31,652
What do you mean straight
kill?

594
00:37:31,686 --> 00:37:33,521
I was thinking the same thing.

595
00:37:33,554 --> 00:37:34,589
What she's saying is that it
doesn't look

596
00:37:34,622 --> 00:37:37,725
as though anything was
consumed, not much anyway.

597
00:37:37,759 --> 00:37:39,961
It's obvious this animal
didn't kill for food.

598
00:37:39,994 --> 00:37:41,294
I mean this type of aggression

599
00:37:41,328 --> 00:37:44,665
could be a possible territorial
issue.

600
00:37:44,699 --> 00:37:46,768
Like protecting a den of pups?

601
00:37:46,801 --> 00:37:48,669
I mean that's possible, but
unlikely.

602
00:37:48,703 --> 00:37:51,404
It still would've consumed the
meat.

603
00:37:54,008 --> 00:37:56,811
There's a lot here that
doesn't make sense yet.

604
00:37:56,844 --> 00:37:59,479
We still have a lot more
investigating to do.

605
00:37:59,514 --> 00:38:01,314
Have you had a chance to
check out the other remains yet?

606
00:38:01,348 --> 00:38:03,985
Not yet, I kind of got my
hands full with this one.

Of course, ma'am.

as I find anything new.

621
00:39:12,587 --> 00:39:14,121
that people have gone missing
around here.

We have this case.

623
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:19,961
Really it's all these cases
and it's got me stumped.

624
00:39:19,994 --> 00:39:23,030
And until today, I thought all
these cases were unrelated.

only one you're working on?

here.

of the bones were broken.

So, it's related?

716
00:45:13,447 --> 00:45:14,815
I'm still waiting on reports

717
00:45:14,848 --> 00:45:16,050
of the second set for
confirmation.

718
00:45:16,083 --> 00:45:18,085
Okay, thanks, Doc.

719
00:45:18,118 --> 00:45:19,353
Hey, Connor, wait.

720
00:45:19,386 --> 00:45:20,321
Yeah.

721
00:45:20,354 --> 00:45:22,122
Be careful out there.

722
00:45:22,156 --> 00:45:25,125
I've never seen anything like
this before.

723
00:45:25,159 --> 00:45:26,293
Right.

724
00:45:26,327 --> 00:45:29,930
[suspenseful music]

725
00:45:29,964 --> 00:45:32,766
[engine roaring]

726
00:45:42,276 --> 00:45:45,279
[suspenseful music]

727
00:46:07,301 --> 00:46:09,069
Did you have trouble finding
the place?

728
00:46:09,103 --> 00:46:10,004
You know me, Mags.

729
00:46:10,037 --> 00:46:11,939
I can track anything down,
especially you.

730
00:46:13,007 --> 00:46:14,174
Let's just get to it.

731
00:46:15,476 --> 00:46:17,211
What aren't you telling me,
Todd?

732
00:46:18,112 --> 00:46:21,115
[suspenseful music]

733
00:46:28,055 --> 00:46:29,990
What'd you bring that for?

734
00:46:30,991 --> 00:46:34,161
I promised your dad,
I wouldn't get you involved in this,

735
00:46:37,398 --> 00:46:40,000
and now I gotta break that
promise, Mag.

736
00:46:40,034 --> 00:46:41,068
Involved with what?

737
00:46:43,137 --> 00:46:45,039
Look, I lied to you earlier.

738
00:46:45,072 --> 00:46:47,875
I know exactly what this
is and what it's all about.

739
00:46:48,677 --> 00:46:51,178
This is your dad's hunting guide
of sort.

740
00:46:51,211 --> 00:46:54,148
All his information, what
he's done, et cetera.

741
00:46:54,181 --> 00:46:55,550
What are you talking about?

742
00:47:00,321 --> 00:47:01,255
He was a hunter,

743
00:47:05,159 --> 00:47:06,427
and he hunted werewolves.

744
00:47:08,929 --> 00:47:12,534
[chuckles] Todd, are
you having a stroke?

745
00:47:13,334 --> 00:47:16,538
I mean, what do you mean
werewolves,

746
00:47:16,571 --> 00:47:19,073
like shape-shifting, eat your
livestock

747
00:47:19,106 --> 00:47:21,442
in the middle of the night
werewolves, I mean [chuckles]?

748
00:47:21,475 --> 00:47:24,478
[suspenseful music]

749
00:47:25,212 --> 00:47:27,915
No, no, no, no, no, that
can't be true [chuckles].

750
00:47:29,316 --> 00:47:31,418
This, this can't be true.

751
00:47:32,986 --> 00:47:34,522
It is, all of it is.

752
00:47:38,660 --> 00:47:43,864
[scoffs] So when Mom
and Dad went missing,

753
00:47:45,499 --> 00:47:48,636
they were hunting werewolves.

754
00:47:50,270 --> 00:47:54,576
Yes, I, I had a vision.

755
00:47:54,609 --> 00:47:57,478
I told your dad, don't go on
this.

756
00:47:57,512 --> 00:47:59,113
I've got a bad feeling,

757
00:47:59,146 --> 00:48:00,682
but he insisted on wanting to
go.

758
00:48:00,715 --> 00:48:03,183
He says, stay back, take care of
Mags

759
00:48:03,217 --> 00:48:05,419
in case something happens to us
and I did.

760
00:48:07,722 --> 00:48:11,125
[suspenseful music]

761
00:48:11,158 --> 00:48:12,426
Are they dead?

762
00:48:13,595 --> 00:48:16,096
I don't, I don't know.

763
00:48:16,130 --> 00:48:18,533
I, I don't know, Mags, I
honestly don't.

764
00:48:18,566 --> 00:48:21,268
[chuckles] Jesus.

765
00:48:21,301 --> 00:48:24,304
[suspenseful music]

766
00:48:32,980 --> 00:48:36,049
Tell me everything you
know, and start with that.

767
00:48:38,085 --> 00:48:39,219
Okay, I will.

768
00:48:46,594 --> 00:48:48,028
Wolves haven't been seen in
the wild

769
00:48:48,061 --> 00:48:50,665
in this part of the country for
decades.

770
00:48:53,133 --> 00:48:55,335
Wolves are highly misunderstood
creatures,

771
00:48:55,369 --> 00:48:58,172
and very rarely attack humans.

772
00:48:58,205 --> 00:49:01,208
[suspenseful music]

773
00:49:01,241 --> 00:49:04,445
It's obvious this animal
didn't kill for food.

774
00:49:04,478 --> 00:49:05,713
There's just something really
strange

775
00:49:05,747 --> 00:49:07,347
about this type of aggression.

776
00:49:08,215 --> 00:49:11,218
[suspenseful music]

777
00:49:21,028 --> 00:49:22,597
This is really tough to
translate.

778
00:49:22,630 --> 00:49:24,998
We realize the languages
here aren't all the same.

779
00:49:25,032 --> 00:49:27,569
Some go back centuries, even
more,

780
00:49:27,602 --> 00:49:29,136
from all over the world.

781
00:49:29,169 --> 00:49:31,639
Most from which we don't have
record of.

782
00:49:31,673 --> 00:49:34,408
So, whoever assembled this
must have been a hunter.

783
00:49:34,441 --> 00:49:36,210
As long as werewolves have
been around,

784
00:49:36,243 --> 00:49:38,212
there've been people hunting
them.

785
00:49:38,245 --> 00:49:40,380
You sound like you're on
the side of the werewolves.

786
00:49:40,414 --> 00:49:42,584
You have to understand
werewolves are people too.

787
00:49:42,617 --> 00:49:45,620
They are literally tortured
with this condition.

788
00:49:45,653 --> 00:49:47,488
It's not their fault they're
like this.

789
00:49:47,522 --> 00:49:50,725
They've experienced great
trauma and they're cursed.

790
00:49:50,758 --> 00:49:54,161
We only kill werewolves if
we have to to protect others.

791
00:49:54,194 --> 00:49:55,128
Well, the people of this town

792
00:49:55,162 --> 00:49:57,532
need protecting from
what's out there, Todd.

793
00:49:58,398 --> 00:50:01,435
Look here, we know the
werewolves emerge at night,

794
00:50:01,468 --> 00:50:03,470
but during the day they're
human,

795
00:50:03,505 --> 00:50:06,340
and almost always
demonstrates these symptoms.

796
00:50:06,373 --> 00:50:08,576
[suspenseful music]

797
00:50:08,610 --> 00:50:09,443
Have you encountered anyone here

798
00:50:09,476 --> 00:50:11,579
in this town with these
descriptions?

799
00:50:12,279 --> 00:50:14,414
No, but Connor might know
something.

800
00:50:15,750 --> 00:50:18,753
[suspenseful music]

801
00:50:20,420 --> 00:50:22,489
[phone ringing]

802
00:50:22,524 --> 00:50:23,457
I got it.

803
00:50:24,692 --> 00:50:25,693
Ryan.

804
00:50:25,727 --> 00:50:26,528
Connor, it's Maggie.

805
00:50:26,561 --> 00:50:29,229
I got something here you need to
see.

806
00:50:29,263 --> 00:50:30,464
You're still at the hotel,
right?

807
00:50:30,497 --> 00:50:31,699
Yeah.

808
00:50:31,733 --> 00:50:33,300
Okay, give me an hour or so.

809
00:50:33,333 --> 00:50:35,703
I'm just finishing up at
around here, hang tight.

810
00:50:38,205 --> 00:50:41,208
[suspenseful music]

811
00:50:44,746 --> 00:50:47,549
[car door thuds]

812
00:50:48,448 --> 00:50:51,418
[suspenseful music]

813
00:50:54,454 --> 00:50:56,323
Hey, Connor, thanks for
coming.

814
00:50:56,356 --> 00:50:57,391
Of course.

815
00:50:57,424 --> 00:50:58,492
This is my friend,
Todd, from the sanctuary.

816
00:50:58,526 --> 00:50:59,594
Nice to meet you.

817
00:50:59,627 --> 00:51:02,396
Likewise, please have a seat.

818
00:51:02,429 --> 00:51:05,098
[suspenseful music]

819
00:51:05,132 --> 00:51:06,768
So, Connor, I noticed on my way
in,

820
00:51:06,801 --> 00:51:09,804
the town's pretty dead, nobody
around?

821
00:51:09,837 --> 00:51:13,140
Yeah, well, empty street
make my job a lot easier.

822
00:51:14,474 --> 00:51:15,342
I bet.

823
00:51:17,377 --> 00:51:20,515
[chuckles] Todd can be very
observant.

824
00:51:20,548 --> 00:51:21,415
I bet.

825
00:51:22,684 --> 00:51:25,319
[Maggie clears throat]

826
00:51:25,352 --> 00:51:27,387
So ah, what've we got here?

827
00:51:28,523 --> 00:51:30,257
Do you wanna tell him, or
should I?

828
00:51:30,290 --> 00:51:31,559
[suspenseful music]

829
00:51:31,593 --> 00:51:33,160
Tell me what?

830
00:51:33,193 --> 00:51:34,529
[suspenseful music]

831
00:51:34,562 --> 00:51:35,730
[Maggie sighs]

832
00:51:35,763 --> 00:51:38,766
[suspenseful music]

833
00:51:42,637 --> 00:51:46,306
[woman shouting]
[suspenseful music]

834
00:51:46,340 --> 00:51:48,543
Ugh, whatever, Karen!

835
00:51:48,576 --> 00:51:50,878
[door slams]

836
00:51:50,912 --> 00:51:53,581
[Jeremy sighs]

837
00:51:54,515 --> 00:51:55,750
[lighter clicks]

838
00:51:55,783 --> 00:51:57,919
I see a little bit of
a carcass or something.

839
00:51:57,952 --> 00:51:58,786
A carcass?

840
00:51:58,820 --> 00:51:59,687
Yeah.

841
00:52:07,394 --> 00:52:08,228
I fuckin' told you.

842
00:52:08,261 --> 00:52:10,798
[phone ringing]

843
00:52:12,700 --> 00:52:13,568
Hello?

844
00:52:14,468 --> 00:52:15,502
Get me out of here.

845
00:52:16,436 --> 00:52:18,940
Why, more lame suburban crime?

846
00:52:18,973 --> 00:52:22,342
No, dude, my mom is
driving me fucking crazy.

847
00:52:22,376 --> 00:52:23,377
I need to go out.

848
00:52:23,410 --> 00:52:24,712
What are you doing later?

849
00:52:24,746 --> 00:52:26,413
[TV buzzing]

850
00:52:26,446 --> 00:52:28,549
We interrupt this program
for a special report.

851
00:52:28,583 --> 00:52:29,684
Hold on.

852
00:52:29,717 --> 00:52:32,185
[suspenseful music]

853
00:52:32,219 --> 00:52:33,521
We're asking all the residents

854
00:52:33,554 --> 00:52:35,389
to stay off the streets tonight.

855
00:52:35,422 --> 00:52:38,660
We will be issuing a curfew
just as a precaution.

856
00:52:39,459 --> 00:52:41,729
Jer, are you watching
the news right now?

857
00:52:41,763 --> 00:52:43,230
Ah, ew, no.

858
00:52:44,164 --> 00:52:47,635
Our main objective is
to keep everyone safe.

859
00:52:47,669 --> 00:52:51,806
Please just stay calm
and comply to this order.

860
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:54,341
Well, apparently we're
not doing anything later.

861
00:52:54,374 --> 00:52:56,276
The Chief has ordered us
to stay off the streets,

862
00:52:56,309 --> 00:52:58,278
and we have some sort of curfew
now.

863
00:52:59,346 --> 00:53:00,180
It's not a problem.

864
00:53:00,213 --> 00:53:02,416
We'll just go to our spot in the
woods.

865
00:53:02,449 --> 00:53:05,687
See, I follow rules, no streets.

866
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:07,722
You're so clever.

867
00:53:07,755 --> 00:53:11,291
I know, grab Jessica
and meet me there later.

868
00:53:11,324 --> 00:53:12,192
Okay, whatever.

869
00:53:12,994 --> 00:53:14,529
Follow these orders,

870
00:53:14,562 --> 00:53:16,964
and that is how we will all stay
safe.

871
00:53:16,998 --> 00:53:18,933
Thank you for your cooperation,

872
00:53:18,966 --> 00:53:21,602
and we will plan to
keep the public informed

873
00:53:21,636 --> 00:53:23,571
of any new developments as they
arise.

874
00:53:24,639 --> 00:53:27,642
[suspenseful music]

875
00:53:36,884 --> 00:53:39,352
[door creaks]

876
00:53:39,386 --> 00:53:42,355
[suspenseful music]

877
00:53:48,062 --> 00:53:52,033
Jesus, this is a lot to take
in.

878
00:53:52,066 --> 00:53:53,333
Hmm.

879
00:53:53,366 --> 00:53:55,036
And you believe this.

880
00:53:55,069 --> 00:53:56,671
Honestly, I do.

881
00:53:56,704 --> 00:53:58,639
I mean everything I
saw, everything I know,

882
00:53:58,673 --> 00:54:01,509
it just points to this being
real.

883
00:54:02,476 --> 00:54:04,011
[sighs] Well then I
guess I have no choice

884
00:54:04,045 --> 00:54:05,513
but to believe it too,

885
00:54:05,546 --> 00:54:07,481
even though I don't want to.

886
00:54:07,515 --> 00:54:08,649
Then you and I need to get out
there

887
00:54:08,683 --> 00:54:09,517
and hunt this thing down

888
00:54:09,550 --> 00:54:11,686
before it kills somebody else,
okay.

889
00:54:11,719 --> 00:54:13,721
Wait, like now?

890
00:54:13,755 --> 00:54:14,722
That's not a good idea.

891
00:54:14,756 --> 00:54:16,824
Look, I've been doing
this for a while now.

892
00:54:16,858 --> 00:54:18,793
We need to hunt this thing down
tonight.

893
00:54:18,826 --> 00:54:19,761
That's not safe.

894
00:54:20,661 --> 00:54:22,630
Trust me, I'll meet up

895
00:54:22,663 --> 00:54:23,831
with you guys tomorrow morning,
okay?

896
00:54:23,865 --> 00:54:25,800
No, you're not going out there
alone.

897
00:54:25,833 --> 00:54:28,268
Maggie's right, we
should wait till morning.

898
00:54:30,638 --> 00:54:32,640
Okay, first light, all right?

899
00:54:32,673 --> 00:54:33,708
Come dawn, we break.

900
00:54:34,809 --> 00:54:36,544
So we're in agreement.

901
00:54:36,577 --> 00:54:38,746
Don't you stick around here
tonight.

902
00:54:38,780 --> 00:54:40,548
Agreed, right, Todd?

903
00:54:40,581 --> 00:54:44,552
Right, all right, well,
I'll be back in the morning.

904
00:54:48,556 --> 00:54:51,025
[Maggie sighs]

905
00:54:54,796 --> 00:54:57,330
I think we need to watch
yourselves around him.

906
00:54:58,431 --> 00:55:00,034
Who, Connor, why?

907
00:55:00,067 --> 00:55:01,269
I don't know.

908
00:55:01,301 --> 00:55:03,971
There's something about him and
I can't put my finger on it.

909
00:55:06,607 --> 00:55:07,642
Well, come on.

910
00:55:07,675 --> 00:55:10,111
Let's find you a room in
this place, I'm exhausted.

911
00:55:10,144 --> 00:55:13,346
[suspenseful music]

912
00:55:39,874 --> 00:55:42,877
[creature growling]

913
00:55:46,781 --> 00:55:49,517
[man screaming]

914
00:56:12,573 --> 00:56:15,576
[suspenseful music]

915
00:56:21,983 --> 00:56:24,719
[man screaming]

916
00:56:49,243 --> 00:56:52,079
[chains rattling]

917
00:56:56,984 --> 00:56:59,720
[man screaming]

918
00:57:02,723 --> 00:57:05,693
[suspenseful music]

919
00:57:13,634 --> 00:57:16,871
Hey, Chief, you working late?

920
00:57:16,904 --> 00:57:19,840
Yeah, and the work's never
done.

921
00:57:19,874 --> 00:57:20,741
Come on in.

922
00:57:27,915 --> 00:57:28,916
So anything new?

923
00:57:29,617 --> 00:57:32,153
No Connor's out on
a couple of leads now,

924
00:57:32,186 --> 00:57:34,221
and I've been going through
these crime scene photos

925
00:57:34,255 --> 00:57:35,623
trying to figure out if there's
something

926
00:57:35,656 --> 00:57:37,024
we possibly could have missed.

927
00:57:37,058 --> 00:57:38,659
Divide and conquer.

928
00:57:38,693 --> 00:57:40,061
Something like that.

929
00:57:40,094 --> 00:57:42,495
[both chuckle]

930
00:57:42,530 --> 00:57:43,531
You look fried, Dad.

931
00:57:44,332 --> 00:57:46,767
Didn't Connor tell you to
call me Chief around here?

932
00:57:46,801 --> 00:57:49,036
Right, but I'm talking as your
son now.

933
00:57:49,070 --> 00:57:51,238
You can't help anybody like
this.

934
00:57:51,272 --> 00:57:52,974
Yeah, maybe you're right.

935
00:57:53,007 --> 00:57:57,044
So much for easing out of
this job and into retirement.

936
00:57:57,078 --> 00:57:59,046
Stop, that's what quitters
say.

937
00:57:59,080 --> 00:58:01,716
You raised me better than that,
right?

938
00:58:01,749 --> 00:58:02,817
I mean, don't get me wrong.

939
00:58:02,850 --> 00:58:04,051
There's a lot going on

940
00:58:04,085 --> 00:58:06,620
for an old guy like you to try
to conquer.

941
00:58:06,654 --> 00:58:07,955
You're still a sharpshooter,

942
00:58:07,989 --> 00:58:09,991
and it's what this town needs
right now.

943
00:58:12,560 --> 00:58:13,227
Hmm.

944
00:58:16,564 --> 00:58:19,100
Well, I'll drink to that.

945
00:58:20,634 --> 00:58:23,804
That's what I'm talking about.

946
00:58:23,838 --> 00:58:26,841
[suspenseful music]

947
00:58:53,868 --> 00:58:58,873
[leaves rustling]
[suspenseful music]

948
00:59:13,187 --> 00:59:14,021
Boo!

949
00:59:14,055 --> 00:59:15,923
[girls laughing]

950
00:59:15,956 --> 00:59:17,358
You fucking asshole!

951
00:59:17,391 --> 00:59:19,326
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

952
00:59:19,360 --> 00:59:20,261
Are you okay?

953
00:59:20,294 --> 00:59:21,128
No.

954
00:59:21,162 --> 00:59:22,363
Way to go, Jer!

955
00:59:22,396 --> 00:59:24,999
You jumped out in front of
me. What was I supposed to do?

956
00:59:25,032 --> 00:59:27,735
Hey, there's only one thing
that'll make this better.

957
00:59:27,768 --> 00:59:28,969
- What?
- What?

958
00:59:29,003 --> 00:59:31,338
Never come to a party
empty handed [laughing]!

959
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:33,774
Seriously, Amanda?

960
00:59:33,808 --> 00:59:34,775
Oh, relax, Jer.

961
00:59:34,809 --> 00:59:35,743
Come on, let's go.

962
00:59:36,410 --> 00:59:39,180
[laughing] Woo hoo hoo!

963
00:59:39,213 --> 00:59:42,683
[girls laughing]

964
00:59:42,716 --> 00:59:43,484
[liquid pouring]

965
00:59:43,518 --> 00:59:45,152
Do you remember that one
summer

966
00:59:45,186 --> 00:59:47,254
when we sent you away for camp?

967
00:59:47,288 --> 00:59:48,322
Not really, why?

968
00:59:51,158 --> 00:59:53,861
Well, I don't think your
mom and I ever told you this.

969
00:59:55,062 --> 00:59:55,896
We sent you away because we
wanted you

970
00:59:55,930 --> 00:59:57,965
to have some structure in your
life.

971
00:59:58,766 --> 01:00:01,235
And you were a pretty big
asshole

972
01:00:01,268 --> 01:00:02,837
when you were a little kid
[chuckles].

973
01:00:03,671 --> 01:00:05,806
[chuckles] Some things
never change, right?

974
01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:08,008
[chuckles] Yeah, you know,

975
01:00:08,042 --> 01:00:09,944
we thought we had it all figured
out.

976
01:00:12,847 --> 01:00:13,948
Send you away for a couple of
weeks.

977
01:00:13,981 --> 01:00:15,749
Enjoy the peace and quiet.

978
01:00:15,783 --> 01:00:17,918
Thought everything would turn
out great.

979
01:00:17,952 --> 01:00:18,786
And did it?

980
01:00:19,753 --> 01:00:21,222
No, no, Dave, it didn't.

981
01:00:22,223 --> 01:00:26,293
You see, ah, we thought
we had it all figured out,

982
01:00:28,195 --> 01:00:29,697
but your little brother,

983
01:00:29,730 --> 01:00:31,432
he was destroyed when you
weren't there.

984
01:00:31,465 --> 01:00:33,701
[chuckles] Really?

985
01:00:33,734 --> 01:00:36,437
He would just sit, look
out the window for hours

986
01:00:36,470 --> 01:00:38,772
just waiting for you to come
home.

987
01:00:38,806 --> 01:00:39,807
We'd tell him,

988
01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:43,210
"Go on out, go play,
have some fun, be a kid."

989
01:00:44,145 --> 01:00:44,945
He wouldn't do it.

990
01:00:44,979 --> 01:00:46,947
He just sat there waiting for
you.

991
01:00:48,749 --> 01:00:50,985
I know the bond between
brothers can be special.

992
01:00:52,219 --> 01:00:54,355
It was like you two were
connected,

993
01:00:54,388 --> 01:00:57,258
because when you weren't
there, part of him was missing.

994
01:00:59,793 --> 01:01:01,162
Why are you telling me this?

995
01:01:02,930 --> 01:01:05,933
[suspenseful music]

996
01:01:11,272 --> 01:01:16,277
You know, it's not easy for
me to admit that I'm wrong.

997
01:01:16,744 --> 01:01:18,779
Dad, it was just camp.

998
01:01:20,347 --> 01:01:21,916
I'm not talking about camp.

999
01:01:23,417 --> 01:01:25,152
You know, parents do all
sorts of strange things

1000
01:01:25,186 --> 01:01:27,054
to ah, protect their kids,

1001
01:01:28,489 --> 01:01:31,125
and I've been keeping
things from you around here.

1002
01:01:31,158 --> 01:01:33,160
I've been doing it for your own
good.

1003
01:01:33,194 --> 01:01:34,228
Like what?

1004
01:01:34,261 --> 01:01:38,432
Well, nothing major, but
ah, some little things.

1005
01:01:38,465 --> 01:01:41,402
But those little things
can add up to big things,

1006
01:01:41,435 --> 01:01:43,938
especially for the cases
that we're working on.

1007
01:01:44,705 --> 01:01:46,508
I guess what I'm trying to say
is

1008
01:01:46,541 --> 01:01:49,276
time for me to take off
the training wheels,

1009
01:01:50,110 --> 01:01:52,146
because I can't protect you
forever.

1010
01:02:00,454 --> 01:02:02,790
I think I just need to
get out of your way,

1011
01:02:04,858 --> 01:02:06,026
and let you do your job.

1012
01:02:07,127 --> 01:02:10,130
[suspenseful music]

1013
01:02:13,300 --> 01:02:16,070
I've never heard you
talk like this before.

1014
01:02:16,103 --> 01:02:17,871
[chuckles] To be honest,

1015
01:02:17,905 --> 01:02:19,940
I had no idea you had it in you.

1016
01:02:20,709 --> 01:02:25,513
[chuckles] Well, don't get
used to it,

1017
01:02:27,414 --> 01:02:31,785
because tomorrow I'm never
gonna be wrong again.

1018
01:02:33,454 --> 01:02:36,190
[glasses clink]

1019
01:02:41,195 --> 01:02:43,330
[Chief exhales deeply]

1020
01:02:43,364 --> 01:02:46,166
[Chief chuckles]

1021
01:02:50,104 --> 01:02:52,239
Ugh, guys, I just don't
understand

1022
01:02:52,273 --> 01:02:54,408
why we are being punished
with this curfew.

1023
01:02:55,476 --> 01:02:58,145
Like, it's our civil right to go
out.

1024
01:02:58,178 --> 01:02:59,213
This is an injustice.

1025
01:02:59,246 --> 01:03:00,781
That's exactly what this is.

1026
01:03:01,882 --> 01:03:03,117
You know I don't drink.

1027
01:03:03,150 --> 01:03:05,119
[scoffs] Come on.

1028
01:03:05,152 --> 01:03:06,854
Yeah, don't be such a puss,
Jer.

1029
01:03:06,887 --> 01:03:07,689
Give me that.

1030
01:03:07,722 --> 01:03:10,924
Bitches, please, I have my
vices.

1031
01:03:10,958 --> 01:03:13,127
They just happen to be
different than yours.

1032
01:03:13,160 --> 01:03:14,094
[girls laughs]

1033
01:03:14,128 --> 01:03:16,531
You mean trashier than ours.

[girls laughing]

1035
01:03:19,333 --> 01:03:20,968
The irony, my sweet tart.

1036
01:03:21,969 --> 01:03:23,237
[girls laughs loudly]

1037
01:03:23,270 --> 01:03:26,006
Jess, help me up, bitches!

1038
01:03:26,040 --> 01:03:26,708
[girls laughing loudly]

1039
01:03:26,741 --> 01:03:28,142
Guys, shut up for a second.

1040
01:03:28,175 --> 01:03:29,376
No, you shut it.

1041
01:03:29,410 --> 01:03:30,844
No, guys, seriously, shut the
fuck up!

1042
01:03:30,878 --> 01:03:33,347
I think I just saw
something move behind you.

1043

[suspenseful music]

1044
01:03:34,915 --> 01:03:35,550

Do you see anything?

1050
01:03:45,426 --> 01:03:47,428
Guys, what it is?

01:05:38,472 --> 01:05:40,140
Maggie, go back.

1073
01:05:41,543 --> 01:05:45,212
[fabric rustling]

1074
01:05:45,245 --> 01:05:46,046
[suspenseful music]

1075
01:05:46,079 --> 01:05:47,981
No, I'm, I'm not gonna leave
you.

1076
01:05:48,015 --> 01:05:49,316
Maggie, go!

1077
01:05:49,349 --> 01:05:52,352
[creature growling]

1078
01:05:53,454 --> 01:05:54,589
Oh, oh, Dad!

1079
01:05:56,658 --> 01:05:58,660
[suspenseful music]

1080
01:05:58,693 --> 01:06:01,495
[Maggie gasping]

1081
01:06:10,772 --> 01:06:13,974
[suspenseful music]

1082
01:07:05,593 --> 01:07:06,594
[Maggie gasps]

1083
01:07:06,628 --> 01:07:09,631
[suspenseful music]

1084
01:07:20,842 --> 01:07:21,776
Todd!

1085
01:07:21,809 --> 01:07:22,442
[knocking on door]

1086
01:07:22,476 --> 01:07:24,077
Todd, wake up, it's Maggie!

1087
01:07:24,111 --> 01:07:26,480
[knocking on door]

1088
01:07:26,514 --> 01:07:27,582
I'm up.

1089
01:07:27,615 --> 01:07:29,249
I need to show you
something. Look at these shots.

1090
01:07:30,417 --> 01:07:31,418
What does that mean?

1091
01:07:32,486 --> 01:07:34,488
- Where did you get this?
- That's Dad's camera?

1092
01:07:34,522 --> 01:07:36,624
I found the card hidden in the
book.

1093
01:07:36,658 --> 01:07:39,661
Look, why does my father have
a picture of Connor in Alaska?

1094
01:07:40,762 --> 01:07:42,362
Is it possible?

1095
01:07:42,396 --> 01:07:43,363
What, what do you mean?

1096
01:07:43,397 --> 01:07:45,432
Well, the last time I
talked with your father,

1097
01:07:45,465 --> 01:07:47,301
he was tracking a lead on a
werewolf.

1098
01:07:47,334 --> 01:07:49,537
He was suspicious of a young man
in town.

1099
01:07:49,571 --> 01:07:52,205
Good looking kid, had
a scar on his shoulder.

1100
01:07:52,239 --> 01:07:54,842
Connor's always rubbing his
shoulder like he injured it.

1101
01:07:54,876 --> 01:07:57,177
I thought there was something
about him.

1102
01:07:57,210 --> 01:07:58,846
So, what do we do?

1103
01:07:58,880 --> 01:08:01,883
Look, Maggie, I promised
your father I'd keep you safe,

1104
01:08:01,916 --> 01:08:04,484
so we aren't going to do
anything tonight.

1105
01:08:04,519 --> 01:08:05,319
[Maggie sighs]

1106
01:08:05,352 --> 01:08:07,454
Stay in your room, lock the
door,

1107
01:08:07,487 --> 01:08:09,489
and don't go anywhere, okay?

1108
01:08:09,524 --> 01:08:11,258
Todd, he might know about my
parents.

1109
01:08:11,291 --> 01:08:13,126
I can't just sit here and wait.

1110
01:08:13,160 --> 01:08:14,529
You have to.

1111
01:08:14,562 --> 01:08:15,697
I tried to warn your parents.

1112
01:08:15,730 --> 01:08:17,297
They didn't listen to me.

1113
01:08:17,331 --> 01:08:19,534
I'm not gonna let this happen
again.

1114
01:08:21,936 --> 01:08:23,403
Fine.

1115
01:08:23,437 --> 01:08:24,672
[suspenseful music]

1116
01:08:24,706 --> 01:08:26,841

[suspenseful music]

1121
01:09:28,468 --> 01:09:31,471
[light piano music]

1122
01:09:34,374 --> 01:09:37,512
Look, Maggie, I promised
your father I'd keep you safe,

1123
01:09:37,545 --> 01:09:39,514
so we aren't gonna do anything
tonight.

1124
01:09:40,480 --> 01:09:43,483
[light piano music]

1125
01:09:45,520 --> 01:09:47,454
[Maggie sighs]

1126
01:09:47,487 --> 01:09:48,623
Oh, God.

1127
01:09:48,656 --> 01:09:51,659
[suspenseful music]

1128
01:09:54,562 --> 01:09:57,532
[light piano music]

1129
01:10:19,821 --> 01:10:22,422
[sighs] Shit.

1130
01:10:24,025 --> 01:10:27,227
[light piano music]

1131
01:10:51,052 --> 01:10:54,254
[suspenseful music]

1132
01:11:06,366 --> 01:11:07,367
You're not in this alone,
okay?

1133
01:11:07,400 --> 01:11:08,569
I was there for your parents.

1134
01:11:08,603 --> 01:11:10,337
I'll be there for you.

1135
01:11:10,370 --> 01:11:11,506
I know, Todd.

1136
01:11:11,539 --> 01:11:14,407
Don't mess with that, I mean
seriously, you're family.

1137
01:11:15,308 --> 01:11:20,515
[creature growling]
[suspenseful music]

1138
01:11:29,690 --> 01:11:32,693
[light piano music]

1139
01:11:43,070 --> 01:11:45,873
[Maggie sighs]

01:11:45,907 --> 01:11:48,910
[suspenseful music]

1141
01:11:56,884 --> 01:11:59,787
Fuck this, I can't wait anymore.

1142
01:11:59,821 --> 01:12:02,824
[suspenseful music]

1143
01:12:05,793 --> 01:12:07,662
Todd, it's time to go!

1144
01:12:09,429 --> 01:12:11,065
[knocking on door]

1145
01:12:11,098 --> 01:12:11,999
Todd, get up!

1146
01:12:13,801 --> 01:12:16,737
[knocking on door]

1147
01:12:18,005 --> 01:12:18,873
Todd?

1148
01:12:20,107 --> 01:12:22,143
[suspenseful music]

1149
01:12:22,176 --> 01:12:23,778
Shit.

1150
01:12:23,811 --> 01:12:26,781
[suspenseful music]

1151
01:12:37,058 --> 01:12:38,391
Oh good, you're here.

1152
01:12:39,861 --> 01:12:41,394
Didn't you go home last night?

1153
01:12:41,428 --> 01:12:42,830
No, sir.

1154
01:12:42,864 --> 01:12:43,698
Well, get yourself together.

1155
01:12:43,731 --> 01:12:45,967
We've got another dead body in
town.

1156
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:47,101
Shit.

1157
01:12:47,134 --> 01:12:49,904
Come on, we better get
going. I need you on the scene.

1158
01:12:49,937 --> 01:12:51,105
Where's your partner?

1159
01:12:51,138 --> 01:12:52,874
Don't know, sir.

1160
01:12:52,907 --> 01:12:54,642
All right, well, let's
go. I'll fill him in later.

1161
01:12:55,743 --> 01:12:58,746
[suspenseful music]

1162
01:13:16,597 --> 01:13:19,767
[car door thuds]

1163
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:22,069
Hello, anyone here, hello?

1164
01:13:22,103 --> 01:13:24,772
[bell ringing]

1165
01:13:26,974 --> 01:13:28,643
Sorry, it's been crazy around
here.

1166
01:13:28,676 --> 01:13:29,476
How can I help?

1167
01:13:29,510 --> 01:13:30,778
I'm looking for Detective
Ryan.

1168
01:13:30,811 --> 01:13:31,879
He just left.

1169
01:13:31,913 --> 01:13:32,747
Can I leave a message?

1170
01:13:32,780 --> 01:13:34,081
Shit, no, no message.

1171
01:13:34,115 --> 01:13:35,149
Where did he go?

1172
01:13:35,182 --> 01:13:36,851
I'm sorry, I can't give
you that information.

1173
01:13:36,884 --> 01:13:37,919
Seriously?

1174
01:13:37,952 --> 01:13:40,855
I've been working with
him on this investigation.

1175
01:13:40,888 --> 01:13:41,856
What did you say your name
was?

1176
01:13:41,889 --> 01:13:43,057
Maggie, Maggie Talbot.

1177
01:13:43,090 --> 01:13:45,425
Please, I really need to talk
to him. This is important.

1178
01:13:46,594 --> 01:13:47,561
Okay, let me try.

1179
01:13:50,197 --> 01:13:51,666
10-100 to 10-04.

1180
01:13:54,568 --> 01:13:55,836
10-100 to 10-04.

1181
01:13:56,904 --> 01:14:00,207
[suspenseful music]

1182
01:14:00,241 --> 01:14:01,709
10-100 to 10-04.

1183
01:14:04,245 --> 01:14:05,680
10-100 to 10-04.

1184
01:14:08,115 --> 01:14:09,617
I'm sorry, he's not responding.

1185
01:14:09,650 --> 01:14:11,018
[scoffs] Great, just great.

1186
01:14:16,824 --> 01:14:19,827
[suspenseful music]

1187
01:14:27,835 --> 01:14:29,570
[Maggie sighs]

1188
01:14:29,603 --> 01:14:32,606
[suspenseful music]

1189
01:14:35,009 --> 01:14:36,744
Where are you, Todd?

1190
01:14:38,145 --> 01:14:38,946
I had a vision.

1191
01:14:38,980 --> 01:14:41,515
I told your dad don't go on this
one.

1192
01:14:41,549 --> 01:14:42,550
I got a bad feeling.

1193
01:14:44,685 --> 01:14:45,953
Are they dead?

1194
01:14:45,987 --> 01:14:47,722
I don't know, Mags.

1195
01:14:47,755 --> 01:14:50,725
[suspenseful music]

1196
01:15:08,009 --> 01:15:09,744
Jesus Christ.

1197
01:15:09,777 --> 01:15:12,780
[suspenseful music]

1198
01:16:01,395 --> 01:16:05,599
[footsteps approaching]

1199
01:16:05,633 --> 01:16:06,333
Stop, sorry, ma'am.

1200
01:16:06,367 --> 01:16:07,201
You can't go any farther.

1201
01:16:07,234 --> 01:16:08,069
I need to find Detective Ryan,
please!

1202
01:16:08,102 --> 01:16:10,104
I'm sorry, you can't go any
farther.

1203
01:16:10,137 --> 01:16:11,906
This is really important.

1204
01:16:11,939 --> 01:16:12,973
He went that way.

1205
01:16:13,007 --> 01:16:15,176
[Maggie sighs]

1206
01:16:15,209 --> 01:16:18,212

[leaves rustling]
[suspenseful music]

1208
01:17:07,995 --> 01:17:10,097
No, God, no, shit!

1209
01:17:10,131 --> 01:17:13,134
[suspenseful music]

1210
01:17:29,216 --> 01:17:31,886
You know the old man's
got bourbon in his office?

1211
01:17:34,788 --> 01:17:38,359
No, serious, me and him
had a moment last night.

1212
01:17:38,392 --> 01:17:41,395
[suspenseful music]

1213
01:17:44,498 --> 01:17:47,968

01:17:51,939 --> 01:17:54,942
[suspenseful music]

1215
01:18:06,187 --> 01:18:08,322
Maggie, what are you doing
here?

1216
01:18:08,355 --> 01:18:09,924
[Maggie gasping]

1217
01:18:09,957 --> 01:18:12,960
[suspenseful music]

1218
01:18:14,395 --> 01:18:16,964
It was you all this time?

1219
01:18:16,997 --> 01:18:19,400
No, Maggie, no, it wasn't me.

1220
01:18:22,970 --> 01:18:24,138
[door thuds]

1221
01:18:24,171 --> 01:18:26,073
Jesus, you look like hell.

1222
01:18:27,041 --> 01:18:28,742
Where's my brother?

1223
01:18:28,776 --> 01:18:31,779
[suspenseful music]

1224
01:18:36,217 --> 01:18:38,852
Maggie, just relax.

1225
01:18:38,886 --> 01:18:40,387
Put the gun down!

1226
01:18:40,421 --> 01:18:42,856
Matt, relax, Connor went out
on a case.

1227
01:18:42,890 --> 01:18:44,291
He'll be back in just a little
bit.

1228
01:18:45,527 --> 01:18:47,261
Is there something I can help
you this?

1229
01:18:47,294 --> 01:18:49,997
[gasping] Nobody can help me.

1230
01:18:51,999 --> 01:18:53,300
You need to go get my dad.

1231
01:18:55,436 --> 01:18:59,106
[suspenseful music]

1232
01:18:59,139 --> 01:19:03,310
Maggie, whatever you're
thinking, it isn't true, okay?

1233
01:19:04,245 --> 01:19:05,746
You killed them [crying].

1234
01:19:06,548 --> 01:19:07,948
I know that it was you!

1235
01:19:09,250 --> 01:19:14,054
You took everything from
me [crying], my parents!

1236
01:19:14,088 --> 01:19:15,456
No, no, Maggie.

1237
01:19:16,123 --> 01:19:19,126
You can't just sit there
and lie to me [crying]!

1238
01:19:19,159 --> 01:19:22,930
Maggie, look, it's me, it's
Connor.

1239
01:19:24,198 --> 01:19:27,234
No [crying].

1240
01:19:27,268 --> 01:19:28,102
[knocking on door]

1241
01:19:28,135 --> 01:19:29,069
Chief, we need you.

1242
01:19:29,103 --> 01:19:30,271
Connor's brother's here.

1243
01:19:30,304 --> 01:19:31,805
Something's not right.

1244
01:19:31,839 --> 01:19:34,842
[suspenseful music]

1245
01:19:37,512 --> 01:19:38,879
Matt, what's going on?

1246
01:19:40,347 --> 01:19:41,115
[gun clicks]

1247
01:19:41,148 --> 01:19:43,183
Whoa, whoa, whoa, let him go
now!

1248
01:19:43,217 --> 01:19:45,185
[suspenseful music]

Look, Maggie, I know
you're scared, okay,

You don't know anything!

You can't, it's just too much.

You're the strongest person I
know.

1255
01:19:57,898 --> 01:20:00,200
But you gotta think about
what you're doing here.

We understand his commitment
