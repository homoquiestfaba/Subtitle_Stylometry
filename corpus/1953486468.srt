1
00:03:10,231 --> 00:03:12,165
Mighty glad to meet you,
Mr. Johnson.

2
00:03:44,665 --> 00:03:47,327
- Mr. Johnson.
- Back here.

3
00:03:47,401 --> 00:03:49,869
This is my Friend From Texas
I told you about.

4
00:03:49,937 --> 00:03:51,666
Yeah.

5
00:03:51,739 --> 00:03:54,799
- Howard, get him an application.
- Sure.

6
00:04:01,382 --> 00:04:03,247
Sit anywhere you like.

7
00:04:08,356 --> 00:04:12,759
- You said I already had the job.
- It's just a Formality.

8
00:04:12,827 --> 00:04:14,954
- You want some coFFee?
- Sure.

9
00:04:15,029 --> 00:04:16,963
- Black, right?
- Right.

10
00:04:31,179 --> 00:04:34,239
Jim, I don't need to tell you
how dangerous it is out there.

11
00:04:34,315 --> 00:04:36,510
The guy has a Fucked-up leg.

12
00:04:36,584 --> 00:04:39,314
IF you were me,
would you hire him?

13
00:04:39,387 --> 00:04:42,618
Give the guy a break.
He drove 1,200 miles.

14
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:44,419
He's too big a risk.

15
00:04:44,492 --> 00:04:46,460
I'Il lose my insurance.

16
00:04:46,527 --> 00:04:47,960
Michael, wait.

17
00:04:50,031 --> 00:04:51,965
Mike, why did you tell him
about your leg?

18
00:04:52,033 --> 00:04:54,126
He'd have Found out
sooner or later.

19
00:04:54,202 --> 00:04:56,796
So what?
By then you'd have had the job.

20
00:04:56,871 --> 00:04:58,805
That wouldn't be right.

21
00:04:58,873 --> 00:05:00,306
Shit.

22
00:05:04,912 --> 00:05:06,573
I'm really sorry about this.

23
00:05:06,647 --> 00:05:09,115
Don't worry about it, Jim.
It's not your fault.

24
00:05:11,819 --> 00:05:13,252
Now what will you do?

25
00:05:14,322 --> 00:05:16,984
I don't know.
Maybe I'II rob a bank.

26
00:05:18,459 --> 00:05:20,393
- You need some money?
- That's okay.

27
00:05:20,461 --> 00:05:22,691
- I'll spot you a couple bucks.
- Don't worry about me.

28
00:05:22,763 --> 00:05:24,458
I'II be all right.

29
00:05:27,635 --> 00:05:29,102
You stay in touch.

30
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:30,603
Yeah. You too.

31
00:06:33,267 --> 00:06:35,201
Anybody here?

32
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:52,886
Is anybody here?

33
00:07:00,494 --> 00:07:01,927
Hello.

34
00:07:07,468 --> 00:07:09,732
I said, is anybody here?

35
00:07:33,961 --> 00:07:37,863
- Can I help you?
- I need some gas.

36
00:07:40,234 --> 00:07:43,101
- Fill her up?
- No, just Five dollars' worth.

37
00:07:44,572 --> 00:07:46,199
Texas, huh?

38
00:07:46,273 --> 00:07:49,140
What in the devil brings you
out here to Wyoming?

39
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:52,646
- I'm looking For work.
- What kind oF work are you looking For?

40
00:07:53,914 --> 00:07:57,179
I hoped to get
on a drilling crew.

41
00:07:57,251 --> 00:07:59,151
Roughneck, huh?

42
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:01,745
Why don't you try Red Rock?

43
00:08:01,822 --> 00:08:04,188
About 50 miles down the road.

44
00:08:04,258 --> 00:08:06,283
There's a bar there
called The Red Rock.

45
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:09,056
Most oF the local crew
hangs out there.

46
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:12,759
Hell, maybe somebody there
can head you in the right direction.

47
00:08:14,835 --> 00:08:17,065
Mighty Fine old car
you got here.

48
00:08:17,138 --> 00:08:21,837
You know, they just don't
make them that way anymore.

49
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:24,978
That will be Five dollars.

50
00:08:28,115 --> 00:08:30,106
Five it is.

51
00:08:32,353 --> 00:08:33,786
Thank you.

52
00:10:13,587 --> 00:10:16,078
- You open?
- Yeah.

53
00:10:17,024 --> 00:10:19,219
- Got any coFFee?
- Yeah.

54
00:10:39,079 --> 00:10:40,512
Thanks.

55
00:10:49,056 --> 00:10:51,251
You were supposed to be here
last Friday.

56
00:10:52,927 --> 00:10:55,487
I was beginning to think
I'd have to Find somebody else.

57
00:10:59,466 --> 00:11:01,457
You are here For the job,
aren't you?

58
00:11:09,677 --> 00:11:12,578
- You must be Wayne?
- Yes.

59
00:11:13,514 --> 00:11:15,448
And you're Lyle From dallas?

60
00:11:18,719 --> 00:11:21,051
- Right.
- Good.

61
00:11:21,121 --> 00:11:24,613
Now just take your coFFee
and let's go in the oFfice.

62
00:11:37,972 --> 00:11:41,066
There's the Five like we agreed.

63
00:11:41,141 --> 00:11:43,803
I'll have the other Five
ready for you when it's...

64
00:11:46,714 --> 00:11:48,648
when it's done.

65
00:11:58,559 --> 00:12:02,051
Today is Tuesday, so she'll be
out riding most oF the day.

66
00:12:05,466 --> 00:12:10,301
The best way to do this is
to make it look like a simple burglary.

67
00:12:10,371 --> 00:12:13,306
Just go out to the house...

68
00:12:13,374 --> 00:12:15,672
break in...

69
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:18,143
and...

70
00:12:18,212 --> 00:12:20,772
mess the place up a little.

71
00:12:23,617 --> 00:12:27,053
Not too much.
Just enough.

72
00:12:28,856 --> 00:12:30,289
And-

73
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:37,454
And then when she comes in,
you-

74
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:44,795
You know what to do.

75
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,513
Thanks.

76
00:12:59,953 --> 00:13:04,481
I Figure the cops will spend
a couple months looking For clues.

77
00:13:04,558 --> 00:13:07,925
Once they come up empty-handed,
they'll get Frustrated...

78
00:13:07,995 --> 00:13:10,259
and, eventually...

79
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:15,359
they'll try to blame some driFter
passing through town.

80
00:13:15,436 --> 00:13:19,236
- It happens all the time, you know?
- Yeah.

81
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:31,712
Who is she?

82
00:13:34,788 --> 00:13:37,154
She's my wiFe.

83
00:15:36,677 --> 00:15:38,907
Your name Suzanne?

84
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:55,962
You're married to Wayne, right?

85
00:16:02,035 --> 00:16:07,371
I don't know how to tell you this,
but your husband, Wayne...

86
00:16:07,441 --> 00:16:10,274
he plans to have you murdered.

87
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,613
Is this a joke?

88
00:16:15,682 --> 00:16:17,582
I'm aFraid not.

89
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:25,223
He paid me to do it.

90
00:16:28,962 --> 00:16:31,590
- What will you do?
- I don't know.

91
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:34,891
I hate to see an innocent woman
get hurt...

92
00:16:34,968 --> 00:16:38,597
but it's an awFul lot oF money.

93
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:46,312
Can I Fix you a drink?

94
00:16:55,022 --> 00:16:58,253
You're taking this a lot better
than I thought you would.

95
00:17:00,627 --> 00:17:03,391
Have you ever been married?

96
00:17:03,463 --> 00:17:05,624
- What?
- What's your name?

97
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:10,036
Lyle.

98
00:17:10,103 --> 00:17:12,264
Have you ever been married,
Lyle?

99
00:17:15,475 --> 00:17:17,636
It does strange things
to people.

100
00:17:20,881 --> 00:17:24,339
Suppose I double his oFFer,
and you do something For me?

101
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:31,823
What?

102
00:17:33,493 --> 00:17:35,427
Take care oF Wayne.

103
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:29,247
- Is that all?
- That will do it.

104
00:18:29,316 --> 00:18:31,807
How much gas you have?

105
00:18:31,885 --> 00:18:34,046
Twenty-nine dollars.

106
00:18:35,989 --> 00:18:37,422
119.78.

107
00:18:42,863 --> 00:18:45,764
- You got anything smaller?
- Not today.

108
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:25,103
Hello?

109
00:21:50,016 --> 00:21:53,281
Hang in there, buddy.
I'll get you out of here.

110
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:12,033
- Get a doctor!
- What happened?

111
00:22:12,105 --> 00:22:14,903
- Somebody get a Fucking doctor!
- Wait here, sir.

112
00:22:16,810 --> 00:22:19,472

113
00:22:20,647 --> 00:22:22,911

114
00:22:22,983 --> 00:22:25,816

00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:28,582
- Weak pulse. Get him into the ER.

116
00:22:28,655 --> 00:22:31,624
Wait here. I'll need
to ask you some questions.

117
00:22:31,691 --> 00:22:33,386
This way, sir.

118
00:22:41,935 --> 00:22:43,402
Are you Finished yet?

119
00:22:45,138 --> 00:22:46,935
No. Have you heard anything?

120
00:22:47,007 --> 00:22:50,841
Sorry. You'll have to wait
For the doctor.

121
00:23:03,757 --> 00:23:05,281
Wait.

122
00:23:07,193 --> 00:23:10,219
I was going to move my car.
How's he doing?

123
00:23:10,297 --> 00:23:12,265
It's good you brought him in
when you did.

124
00:23:12,332 --> 00:23:14,266
He lost a lot oF blood.

125
00:23:16,937 --> 00:23:19,064
Hi, Doc. Is this the guy
that brought him in?

126
00:23:19,139 --> 00:23:22,666
Yeah.
Matt, can I talk to you?

127
00:23:26,313 --> 00:23:30,511
- Going somewhere?
- Yeah, my car is out there.

128
00:23:30,583 --> 00:23:33,677
It's in the red zone.
I was gonna move it.

129
00:23:35,221 --> 00:23:36,779
- Yeah?
- That was the sheriFF.

130
00:23:36,856 --> 00:23:38,790
He's on his way over.

131
00:23:42,529 --> 00:23:45,327
- Did you call him?
- What do you think?

132
00:23:46,666 --> 00:23:49,999
- You got some ID on you?
- Yeah.

133
00:23:52,339 --> 00:23:54,034
Is there a problem, OFficer?

134
00:23:55,208 --> 00:23:56,835
Yeah.

135
00:23:56,910 --> 00:24:01,108
Looks like we have
an attempted homicide on our hands.

136
00:24:01,181 --> 00:24:03,445
What are you talking about?
It was an accident.

137
00:24:03,516 --> 00:24:06,713
Then how do you explain these?

138
00:24:07,921 --> 00:24:09,752
He's been shot twice
in the stomach.

139
00:24:45,625 --> 00:24:48,423
How is Kurt doing?

140
00:24:48,495 --> 00:24:52,625
He's pretty bad oFf,
but the doctor says he'll make it.

141
00:24:52,699 --> 00:24:56,066
IF there's any change in his condition,
let me know.

142
00:25:00,173 --> 00:25:01,606
"Michael Williams. "

143
00:25:03,610 --> 00:25:05,578
You'll be spending some time
with us...

144
00:25:05,645 --> 00:25:08,409
until we can get
to the bottom oF this.

145
00:25:08,481 --> 00:25:11,973
Wayne, can I talk to you
For a minute?

146
00:25:15,722 --> 00:25:17,587
You're gonna hold this guy?

147
00:25:17,657 --> 00:25:21,149
- You got somebody else?
- No, but it doesn't make sense...

148
00:25:21,227 --> 00:25:24,060
he'd shoot him,
then bring him to the hospital.

149
00:25:24,130 --> 00:25:27,327
Yeah. Well, Odessa, Texas.
That's not too Far.

150
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:30,563
We can just get him on the phone
if we have any questions.

151
00:25:32,305 --> 00:25:36,071
You and Russ impound the car.
I'll take him to the station.

152
00:25:36,142 --> 00:25:37,575
Yes, sir.

153
00:25:40,113 --> 00:25:41,546
Get in.

154
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,723
All right, kid.

155
00:25:55,795 --> 00:25:59,788
Start talking. You have two minutes
to tell me what is going on.

156
00:26:01,334 --> 00:26:03,393
I thought you needed
a stupid bartender.

157
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:05,495
- Don't fuck with me.
- I'm not.

158
00:26:08,174 --> 00:26:10,768
- Who else knows about this?
- Nobody.

159
00:26:10,844 --> 00:26:14,177
I said, don't Fuck with me!

160
00:26:14,247 --> 00:26:15,805
I'm not.

161
00:26:24,557 --> 00:26:26,718
What about the guy in the hospital?
What happened?

162
00:26:26,793 --> 00:26:29,728
I don't know anything about that.

163
00:26:29,796 --> 00:26:32,424
You don't have to worry.
I won't say anything to anyone.

164
00:26:32,499 --> 00:26:36,401
- What about the money?
- It's in my car glove compartment.

165
00:26:36,469 --> 00:26:38,300
Good.

166
00:26:40,473 --> 00:26:42,737
So, what do you think?

167
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:45,835
Why don't you just drop me oFF...

168
00:26:45,912 --> 00:26:47,743
and we'll both Forget
the whole thing.

169
00:30:32,605 --> 00:30:34,300
What the fuck
are you doing?

170
00:30:38,945 --> 00:30:43,211
- My car broke down.
- Where? I don't see a car.

171
00:30:43,282 --> 00:30:46,308
- It's just over that ridge.
- Over that ridge, huh?

172
00:30:47,286 --> 00:30:49,880
You're one lucky son oF a bitch.

173
00:30:51,157 --> 00:30:53,091
IF I hadn't just
had my brakes done...

174
00:30:54,293 --> 00:30:56,488
I'd be picking your brains
out oF my radiator.

175
00:30:56,562 --> 00:31:00,658
- Fuck.
- Listen, I hate to ask you this...

176
00:31:00,733 --> 00:31:02,598
but could you give me a ride?

177
00:31:04,370 --> 00:31:08,830
I don't know.
Are you dangerous?

178
00:31:17,717 --> 00:31:23,417
I just need a ride. You can drop me oFF
at the nearest gas station.

179
00:31:23,489 --> 00:31:25,957
Okay, cowboy,
you got yourself a ride.

180
00:31:26,025 --> 00:31:27,686
Get in.

181
00:31:50,349 --> 00:31:52,283
Son oF a bitch.

182
00:31:59,959 --> 00:32:02,655
You banged it up pretty good.
How'd you do that?

183
00:32:03,563 --> 00:32:05,963
- I was in the Marine Corp.
- No shit?

184
00:32:09,869 --> 00:32:11,700
First Forest Recon.

185
00:32:11,771 --> 00:32:14,797
Last unit to leave Vietnam.
April oF '71.

186
00:32:14,874 --> 00:32:16,808
I got the same one right here.

187
00:32:17,944 --> 00:32:20,105
Where were you stationed?

188
00:32:20,179 --> 00:32:22,306
I was with the 24th in Lebanon.

189
00:32:25,017 --> 00:32:26,951
The truck bomb thing-
You were there?

190
00:32:27,019 --> 00:32:29,010
Yeah.

191
00:32:30,957 --> 00:32:33,357
Holy shit! Were you
in that building they hit?

192
00:32:35,595 --> 00:32:38,621
damn!
You are one lucky son oF a bitch.

193
00:32:38,698 --> 00:32:40,962
I know!

194
00:32:41,033 --> 00:32:43,194
I mean, I know I'm lucky.

195
00:32:43,269 --> 00:32:45,362
241 guys weren't.

196
00:32:48,941 --> 00:32:52,741
- Thanks For the ride.
- Anytime, soldier.

197
00:33:20,306 --> 00:33:23,036
Are you going in here?

198
00:33:23,109 --> 00:33:25,771
Yeah, I got to take care
oF some business...

199
00:33:25,845 --> 00:33:27,403
and I want to buy you a drink.

200
00:33:28,314 --> 00:33:30,339
Thanks, but I should get going.

201
00:33:30,416 --> 00:33:33,180
I nearly greased your can
back there.

202
00:33:33,252 --> 00:33:36,517
Now, the least I can do
is buy you a beer.

203
00:33:36,589 --> 00:33:38,921
Thanks,
but I should get my car.

204
00:33:38,991 --> 00:33:40,959
I'll tell you what.

205
00:33:41,027 --> 00:33:44,258
Let me buy you a beer,
and then I'll help you get your car.

206
00:33:46,165 --> 00:33:50,101
That's okay.
You've done enough already.

207
00:33:50,169 --> 00:33:53,104
Now I said
I'd help you get your car.

208
00:33:54,173 --> 00:33:55,800
Really, it's okay.

209
00:33:57,243 --> 00:33:59,177
You don't want
to drink with me?

210
00:34:00,246 --> 00:34:02,111
I'm not good enough
to buy you a beer?

211
00:34:02,181 --> 00:34:04,581
No, it's not that.

212
00:34:04,650 --> 00:34:07,778
Then what the Fuck's
your problem?

213
00:34:07,853 --> 00:34:09,787
Us Marines
got to stick together.

214
00:34:11,457 --> 00:34:12,890
Come on!

215
00:34:14,327 --> 00:34:18,058
- Okay, soldier. I can get my car later.
- That's it.

216
00:34:18,130 --> 00:34:20,064
Now, that's more like it.

217
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:24,001
All right. Come on.

218
00:34:34,547 --> 00:34:36,242
What'll you have?

219
00:34:36,315 --> 00:34:38,943
I'd like a shot oF Jim Beam
and a bottle oF Bud.

220
00:34:39,952 --> 00:34:43,786
- How about you?
- The same.

221
00:34:43,856 --> 00:34:47,155
You know,
that never should have happened...

222
00:34:47,226 --> 00:34:50,753
what happened to you
and our boys over there in Lebanon.

223
00:34:50,830 --> 00:34:54,891
You get in there,
you just gotta give it your best shot.

224
00:34:56,936 --> 00:34:58,369
Right.

225
00:35:04,377 --> 00:35:05,810
That will be 6.50.

226
00:35:07,647 --> 00:35:11,708
You got a guy here named Wayne?

227
00:35:11,784 --> 00:35:14,275
- You mean the owner?
- Yeah, that's him.

228
00:35:14,353 --> 00:35:16,583
Wayne Brown.

229
00:35:16,656 --> 00:35:18,647
- Sorry, he's out.
- damn.

230
00:35:18,724 --> 00:35:22,626
He's probably out looking For me.
I was supposed to be here last week.

231
00:35:22,695 --> 00:35:24,822
I can call him...

232
00:35:24,897 --> 00:35:26,489
iF it's important.

233
00:35:26,565 --> 00:35:29,090
Would you?
I'd appreciate that.

234
00:35:29,168 --> 00:35:32,501
Tell him Lyle From Dallas
Finally showed up.

235
00:35:32,571 --> 00:35:35,972
- He'll know who you mean.
- Sure thing.

236
00:35:36,042 --> 00:35:38,306
I never did catch your name.

237
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:43,478
- It's nice meeting you, Michael.
- Likewise.

238
00:35:43,549 --> 00:35:47,815
Listen, I have to use the head.
I'll be right back.

239
00:35:47,887 --> 00:35:50,720
Yeah, well, don't piss on the seat,
even iF they did.

240
00:35:51,791 --> 00:35:53,281
It's not lucky.

241
00:36:30,096 --> 00:36:32,724
Did you just pick somebody up
outside oF town?

242
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:37,360
- Yeah, I did.
- Where is he?

243
00:36:37,436 --> 00:36:40,496
Now, Wayne,
why would you be inquiring?

244
00:36:55,387 --> 00:36:57,912
You check out back that way.
I'll go over here.

245
00:36:57,990 --> 00:36:59,651
He can't have gotten too Far.

246
00:38:05,891 --> 00:38:09,918
I'm not going to Sheridan to see a bitch
with a pissed-oFf husband.

247
00:38:15,935 --> 00:38:18,699
- I can't get to Sheridan till next week.

248
00:38:18,771 --> 00:38:22,104

The First sign oF bullshit-

249
00:38:39,024 --> 00:38:41,652
Give me the goddamn suitcase.

250
00:39:41,754 --> 00:39:43,187
God!

251
00:39:48,193 --> 00:39:51,629
Does that tickle?
'Cause it won't iF I pull the trigger.

252
00:39:51,697 --> 00:39:53,665
What the hell are you doing
on my truck?

253
00:39:53,732 --> 00:39:55,996
Sorry, boss.
I didn't mean to scare you.

254
00:39:56,068 --> 00:39:59,595
Hey, do I look scared to you?

255
00:40:02,942 --> 00:40:05,308
I was trying to ditch my old lady.

256
00:40:05,377 --> 00:40:07,038
You were what?

257
00:40:07,112 --> 00:40:10,479
She caught me in the bar,
and I wasn't supposed to be there.

258
00:40:10,549 --> 00:40:14,986
- She started sprouting horns and shit.
- Bullshit.

259
00:40:15,054 --> 00:40:18,080
Look at that uncontrolled response
to bullshit.

260
00:40:18,157 --> 00:40:20,387
- I hate when that happens.
- Yeah, I don't like it either...

261
00:40:20,459 --> 00:40:22,654
but I had to get out of there.

262
00:40:22,728 --> 00:40:26,164
- So you climbed up on my truck?
- Yeah.

263
00:40:26,231 --> 00:40:27,755
Isn't that kind oF stupid?

264
00:40:27,833 --> 00:40:31,098
Yeah, it is,
but you've never met my wiFe.

265
00:40:31,170 --> 00:40:34,139
- She's spooky.
- Yeah?

266
00:40:36,141 --> 00:40:38,666
You're lying to me.
Get oFF my truck.

267
00:40:38,744 --> 00:40:40,678
Come on, get oFF the truck.

268
00:40:42,481 --> 00:40:43,914
Oh, man.

269
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:51,549
- I'm headed north iF you want a ride.
- Thanks.

270
00:41:03,302 --> 00:41:05,361
There's a ranch
just up the road.

271
00:41:05,437 --> 00:41:08,065
You can drop me oFf there.

272
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:11,837
What's the deal? Am I taking you
back to or away From your old lady?

273
00:41:14,046 --> 00:41:18,005
Neither. Actually, I have
a little business to take care oF.

274
00:41:18,083 --> 00:41:19,516
Business?

275
00:41:21,286 --> 00:41:22,719
Is she pretty?

276
00:41:25,924 --> 00:41:27,858
Yeah, she is pretty.

277
00:41:38,737 --> 00:41:40,170
Good luck, Spider-Man.

278
00:41:41,673 --> 00:41:43,106
Thanks For the ride.

279
00:42:33,859 --> 00:42:37,693
It's okay. It's all right.

280
00:42:37,763 --> 00:42:39,731
I'm not who you think I am.

281
00:42:39,798 --> 00:42:41,231
I lied.

282
00:42:42,367 --> 00:42:45,165
I needed a job real bad.

283
00:42:45,237 --> 00:42:48,934
Your husband oFFered me one,
and I took it beFore I knew what it was.

284
00:42:49,007 --> 00:42:51,805
- You're not a killer.
- That's right.

285
00:42:53,212 --> 00:42:56,079
But the guy I'm supposed to be
just drove into town.

286
00:42:56,148 --> 00:43:00,050
- You have to get out oF here.
- Suddenly my liFe's in danger again?

287
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:01,950
That's right.

288
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:03,817
You expect me to believe you?

289
00:43:03,889 --> 00:43:06,517
What is this? You want my money?
I don't have any more money.

290
00:43:06,592 --> 00:43:08,355
Get the Fuck out oF my house!

291
00:43:08,427 --> 00:43:10,827
You're not listening to me.

292
00:43:10,896 --> 00:43:14,161
Your Friend, the ranch hand,
has been shot!

293
00:43:18,737 --> 00:43:20,864
- You mean Kurt?
- Yeah.

294
00:43:20,939 --> 00:43:23,066
- What happened?
- I don't know.

295
00:43:23,142 --> 00:43:25,440
He was lying in the road,
and I took him to the hospitaI.

296
00:43:25,511 --> 00:43:27,479
Pack your bags and get going.

297
00:43:27,546 --> 00:43:29,138
- Is he alive?
- Yeah.

298
00:43:29,214 --> 00:43:32,445
- They know who shot him?
- No, he was unconscious.

299
00:43:32,518 --> 00:43:36,579
I wouldn't be surprised iF your husband
had something to do with it, would you?

300
00:43:47,699 --> 00:43:49,132
Get dressed.

301
00:44:01,647 --> 00:44:04,377
He's in the living room.
Now go to the balcony.

302
00:44:04,449 --> 00:44:05,882
Come on.

303
00:46:00,032 --> 00:46:01,624
- Is that him?
- Yeah.

304
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:06,137
- What should I do?
- IF I were you, I'd get a divorce.

305
00:46:11,543 --> 00:46:13,033
- Where you going?
- I don't want to be here...

306
00:46:13,111 --> 00:46:15,773
when Lyle From Dallas wakes up,
do you?

307
00:46:30,629 --> 00:46:32,358
There's a jeep behind the barn.

308
00:46:32,431 --> 00:46:34,365
Let me grab a coat.
I'll be right out.

309
00:46:59,358 --> 00:47:01,792
The Fucking story oF my liFe.

310
00:47:04,129 --> 00:47:07,189
- What kind oF mileage does this get?
- Why?

311
00:47:07,265 --> 00:47:09,790
We're almost out oF gas.

312
00:47:19,144 --> 00:47:22,511
- Which way is the nearest town?
- Medicine Bow is 40 miles that way.

313
00:47:22,581 --> 00:47:26,278
- Is there a sheriFF there?
- Yes.

314
00:47:26,351 --> 00:47:28,080
Are you going to the police?

315
00:47:28,153 --> 00:47:32,487
Yeah, I want to get this mess cleaned
beFore anyone else gets hurt.

316
00:47:33,959 --> 00:47:35,358
What will you tell them?

317
00:47:36,995 --> 00:47:38,462
The truth.

318
00:47:38,530 --> 00:47:42,398
- You sure about that?
- Yeah, I'm sure about that.

319
00:47:42,467 --> 00:47:45,436
How will you explain
impersonating a hired killer...

320
00:47:45,504 --> 00:47:47,563
and taking $10,000
From my husband, the sheriFF?

321
00:47:53,078 --> 00:47:55,410
What do you suggest?

322
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:58,449
I suggest we get as Far away From here
as possible.

323
00:47:58,517 --> 00:48:02,749
- You're just gonna leave?
- Yeah.

324
00:48:02,821 --> 00:48:06,086
What the hell do I have
that's worth coming back For?

325
00:48:11,029 --> 00:48:14,055
Russ, give me the registration.

326
00:48:18,837 --> 00:48:21,431
- Son oF a bitch got away.
- What?

327
00:48:21,506 --> 00:48:24,304
Yeah, he kicked me.
He went berserk.

328
00:48:24,376 --> 00:48:26,310
Want us to call in an APB?

329
00:48:27,446 --> 00:48:29,038
An APB? No, please.

330
00:48:29,114 --> 00:48:32,083
Let's just keep this amongst ourselves.
It's bad enough.

331
00:48:32,150 --> 00:48:35,017
- Did you Find anything?
- No, we just started looking.

332
00:48:37,422 --> 00:48:41,483
- Look, Find him. Tonight.
- Sure.

333
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:43,494
- I'll be in the bar.
- You okay?

334
00:48:45,163 --> 00:48:47,723
Yeah, I'm okay. Sure. Thanks.

335
00:48:54,773 --> 00:48:56,206
What you got?

336
00:48:56,274 --> 00:48:59,209
Do you suppose this has anything
to do with anything?

337
00:49:14,092 --> 00:49:18,188
- Do you have that money I gave you?
- No, it was in my car.

338
00:49:18,263 --> 00:49:20,493
Wayne's deputies
must have it by now.

339
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:26,562
- How are you paying For the gas?
- I have about 80 bucks leFt.

340
00:49:26,638 --> 00:49:29,368
Great. Can I see your wallet?

341
00:49:50,562 --> 00:49:52,496
I like that better than Lyle.

342
00:49:54,132 --> 00:49:56,225
- Where are you going?
- I'm thirsty.

343
00:49:56,301 --> 00:49:58,235
I'll be in the bar.

344
00:50:11,983 --> 00:50:15,851
- We should get going.
- You should relax and have a drink.

345
00:50:15,921 --> 00:50:17,752
You wanted
to get out of here.

346
00:50:17,822 --> 00:50:19,585
What's one drink?

347
00:50:26,498 --> 00:50:29,524
- What will you have?
- Give me a beer.

348
00:50:37,509 --> 00:50:39,101
You know...

349
00:50:40,845 --> 00:50:43,678
I realize you didn't
have to come back for me.

350
00:50:43,748 --> 00:50:45,682
You could have just leFt...

351
00:50:46,851 --> 00:50:48,443
but you didn't...

352
00:50:50,288 --> 00:50:51,778
did you?

353
00:50:54,759 --> 00:50:56,192
Thank you.

354
00:50:58,730 --> 00:51:00,459
That will be $1.25.

355
00:51:04,970 --> 00:51:06,904
You must think I'm pretty awFul.

356
00:51:08,306 --> 00:51:13,073
- Why is that?
- I did ask you to take care of Wayne.

357
00:51:13,144 --> 00:51:14,907
Right.

358
00:51:14,980 --> 00:51:18,416
Under the circumstances,
I can't say as I blame you.

359
00:51:20,986 --> 00:51:22,920
You're a nice guy,
aren't you?

360
00:51:22,988 --> 00:51:24,421
I try to be.

361
00:51:33,331 --> 00:51:35,595
God, I love tequila.

362
00:51:35,667 --> 00:51:39,103
Maybe that's what we should do:
go to Mexico.

363
00:51:39,170 --> 00:51:41,434
- Ever been there?
- Yeah.

364
00:51:41,506 --> 00:51:43,565
- What's it like?
- Hot.

365
00:51:43,642 --> 00:51:45,940
Sounds perFect.

366
00:51:49,848 --> 00:51:52,112
- Let me ask you something.
- Sure.

367
00:51:52,183 --> 00:51:53,650
Why did Wayne try to-

368
00:51:53,718 --> 00:51:55,447
- Get rid of me?
- Yeah.

369
00:51:57,455 --> 00:51:58,888
I'll have another shot.

370
00:51:58,957 --> 00:52:00,948
- Tequila?
- Whiskey.

371
00:52:01,026 --> 00:52:02,789
- You got it.
- Thanks.

372
00:52:06,798 --> 00:52:09,062
It's alI about money.

373
00:52:09,134 --> 00:52:11,568
My parents died severaI years ago
in an accident...

374
00:52:11,636 --> 00:52:14,799
and I received a Fairly large
insurance settlement.

375
00:52:14,873 --> 00:52:17,307
Wayne's just gotten used
to spending it.

376
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:27,247
He probably Figures
iF he divorced me he'd get nothing.

377
00:52:27,318 --> 00:52:30,253
IF I'm six feet under the ground
with a bullet in my head...

378
00:52:30,321 --> 00:52:31,845
he gets to keep everything.

379
00:52:34,159 --> 00:52:37,595
- That's hard to imagine.
- That's my husband.

380
00:52:52,310 --> 00:52:55,609
- Hello.
- Wayne, she got away.

381
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:57,944
The cowboy was here.
They got the jump on me.

382
00:52:58,016 --> 00:53:00,109
- Do you know where they went?
- Hell, no. How could I?

383
00:53:00,185 --> 00:53:04,554
I2ve been staring at my eyelids
for the last hour and a half.

384
00:53:04,622 --> 00:53:06,556
You can't let them get away.

385
00:53:06,624 --> 00:53:10,651
I didn't come all the way uu here
to play hide-and-seek.

386
00:53:10,729 --> 00:53:13,562
You have got to Find her.

387
00:53:13,631 --> 00:53:16,566
I'll take a look around,
but it's going to cost you.

388
00:53:16,634 --> 00:53:20,070
- I want another five up front.
- Fine.

389
00:53:20,138 --> 00:53:22,072
Just Find her.

390
00:53:22,140 --> 00:53:24,404
When do I get the money?

391
00:53:24,476 --> 00:53:26,569
Tomorrow morning.

392
00:53:26,644 --> 00:53:29,408
Just come to my oFFice.
It's right behind the bar.

393
00:53:29,481 --> 00:53:32,746
- what time?
- 9:30.

394
00:53:34,152 --> 00:53:35,585
I'll be there.

395
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:44,753
What do you say?

396
00:53:44,829 --> 00:53:48,094
You want to go
to Mexico with me or what?

397
00:53:49,667 --> 00:53:52,261
In our present condition,
I don't think we'd get Far.

398
00:53:52,337 --> 00:53:54,771
What do you think we should do?

399
00:53:54,839 --> 00:53:57,433
Get a cup oF coFFee.

400
00:53:57,509 --> 00:53:59,443
I got a better idea.

401
00:54:01,679 --> 00:54:03,203
What's that?

402
00:54:05,784 --> 00:54:07,376
ComFort Inn.

403
00:54:46,991 --> 00:54:49,585
You want to Fix me a drink?

404
00:54:49,661 --> 00:54:51,925
Whiskey okay?

405
00:54:51,996 --> 00:54:53,429
Sounds nice.

406
00:55:05,777 --> 00:55:07,711
Don't you like me?

407
00:55:11,282 --> 00:55:13,216
Yeah, I like you.

408
00:55:16,454 --> 00:55:18,388
Then what's the matter?

409
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:25,726
Just try to make a point
oF staying away From married women.

410
00:55:25,797 --> 00:55:30,359
Why? Marriage is just
a state oF mind.

411
00:55:30,435 --> 00:55:32,562
Not in Texas.

412
00:55:32,637 --> 00:55:34,571
We're not in Texas.

413
00:56:44,943 --> 00:56:46,877
Tell me about Mexico.

414
00:56:52,150 --> 00:56:53,583
Please.

415
00:56:54,652 --> 00:56:56,085
Mexico.

416
00:56:59,657 --> 00:57:03,616
When I was a kid,
my dad took me to Veracruz...

417
00:57:03,695 --> 00:57:07,631
and he bought me
a purple sombrero...

418
00:57:07,699 --> 00:57:10,793
and a little guitar.

419
00:57:10,868 --> 00:57:12,529
It was nice.

420
00:57:14,939 --> 00:57:18,033
I'll bet you were
a cute little boy.

421
00:57:18,109 --> 00:57:19,542
I don't know.

422
00:57:21,446 --> 00:57:24,381
- We could go there together.
- Yeah?

423
00:57:25,616 --> 00:57:27,880
Get a little house by the ocean.

424
00:57:27,952 --> 00:57:30,216
Drink margaritas all day.

425
00:57:30,288 --> 00:57:32,222
Watch the sun set.

426
00:57:38,463 --> 00:57:40,556
And take siestas together.

427
00:57:42,967 --> 00:57:45,401
Morning, noon and night.

428
00:58:09,027 --> 00:58:10,961
You're up early.

429
00:58:12,230 --> 00:58:14,824
- I've been thinking.
- About what?

430
00:58:16,401 --> 00:58:18,164
About Mexico.

431
00:58:18,236 --> 00:58:21,171
We'll need more than 80 bucks
to get there.

432
00:58:23,074 --> 00:58:26,669
- We're going to Mexico?
- Yeah.

433
00:58:26,744 --> 00:58:30,009
Wayne always keeps some cash
in a saFe at the oFFice.

434
00:58:30,081 --> 00:58:31,844
Wait a minute.

435
00:58:33,751 --> 00:58:36,686
You want to go back to Red Rock?

436
00:58:36,754 --> 00:58:39,518
You have a better idea?

437
00:58:39,590 --> 00:58:43,617
You're just gonna walk into your
husband's bar and take his money?

438
00:58:44,762 --> 00:58:46,195
It's my money.

439
00:58:47,565 --> 00:58:49,533
Your money.

440
00:58:52,103 --> 00:58:54,230
You really think
you can get away with that?

441
00:58:56,774 --> 00:58:59,038
I can't let him have it all.

442
00:59:01,112 --> 00:59:04,980
How much money
are you talking about anyway?

443
00:59:05,049 --> 00:59:08,576
Enough. Are you coming?

444
00:59:28,072 --> 00:59:29,835
Okay, I'll-

445
00:59:31,476 --> 00:59:32,909
I'll go.

446
01:00:19,056 --> 01:00:20,990
You sure you have
the right combination?

447
01:00:21,058 --> 01:00:22,491
Yes.

448
01:00:24,529 --> 01:00:27,987
- Could he have changed it?
- It's possible. Would you like to try?

449
01:00:34,005 --> 01:00:35,438
Right to 24.

450
01:00:36,941 --> 01:00:38,374
Left to 87.

451
01:00:40,144 --> 01:00:42,078
Right to 56.

452
01:00:42,146 --> 01:00:43,909
LeFt to 12.

453
01:00:43,981 --> 01:00:45,915
Right to 99.

454
01:00:53,824 --> 01:00:56,384
- That's it?
- Yeah. Let's go.

455
01:00:56,460 --> 01:00:57,927
I can't believe it.

456
01:01:13,444 --> 01:01:14,877
Oh, yeah.

457
01:02:32,456 --> 01:02:34,117
Come in.
The door's open.

458
01:02:36,694 --> 01:02:38,127
Good morning, Wayne.

459
01:02:40,131 --> 01:02:41,564
Good morning, Fellas.

460
01:02:41,632 --> 01:02:44,726
- What are you boys doing?
- I got a call From the hospital.

461
01:02:44,802 --> 01:02:49,136
One oF the nurses was going through
Kurt's clothing. She found this.

462
01:02:49,206 --> 01:02:50,730
How's he doing?

463
01:02:50,808 --> 01:02:53,743
He's in critical condition,
but the doctor says he'll make it.

464
01:02:53,811 --> 01:02:56,939
- Talked to him?
- No. He's under heavy sedation.

465
01:03:00,818 --> 01:03:03,719
I called the FBl.
They're on their way.

466
01:03:04,422 --> 01:03:06,754
$1.9 million.

467
01:03:06,824 --> 01:03:10,521
Gotta hand it to you, Wayne.
Or should I call you Kevin?

468
01:03:10,594 --> 01:03:13,688
It's a lot oF cash
to walk away with.

469
01:03:13,764 --> 01:03:16,858
- Russ, you got that letter?
- Uh-huh.

470
01:03:16,934 --> 01:03:18,868
Came in the mail this morning.

471
01:03:25,276 --> 01:03:27,710
"SheriFf oF Red Rock,
Wayne Brown may have hired...

472
01:03:27,778 --> 01:03:29,871
a killer to murder his wiFe.

473
01:03:29,947 --> 01:03:32,541
She is likely to do the same.

474
01:03:32,616 --> 01:03:34,106
This is not a joke. "

475
01:03:35,953 --> 01:03:37,443
This is a joke.
What's going on?

476
01:03:37,521 --> 01:03:40,456
I don't know.
Why don't you tell me?

477
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:46,396
Did you pay that guy From Texas
to murder Suzanne?

478
01:03:47,798 --> 01:03:49,231
This is ridiculous.

479
01:03:49,300 --> 01:03:52,064
Was Kurt trying
to blackmail you?

480
01:03:52,136 --> 01:03:54,104
- What?
- Is that why you shot him?

481
01:03:56,474 --> 01:03:58,772
Did you guys come here
to arrest me?

482
01:03:58,843 --> 01:04:01,573
Kind oF looks that way.

483
01:04:01,645 --> 01:04:03,875
Then go ahead.
Arrest me.

484
01:04:03,948 --> 01:04:07,440
I have nothing more to say
until I talk to my lawyer.

485
01:04:07,518 --> 01:04:09,383
Okay, let's go.

486
01:04:31,776 --> 01:04:36,543
"Wanted For the theFt
oF $1.9 million...

487
01:04:37,615 --> 01:04:39,742
From the Benton/Barne
Steel Mill.

488
01:04:39,817 --> 01:04:43,082
Kevin and Ann McCord.

489
01:04:43,154 --> 01:04:45,884
May be armed and dangerous. "

490
01:04:45,956 --> 01:04:50,552
Looks like the only thing
you didn't lie about is your marriage.

491
01:04:50,628 --> 01:04:53,062
It's not what you think.
I can explain.

492
01:04:53,130 --> 01:04:55,223
It was Wayne.
I had nothing to do with it.

493
01:04:55,299 --> 01:04:57,233
One day he comes home
and says, "Pack your bags. "

494
01:04:57,301 --> 01:05:00,065
The next thing I know,
I'm on the FBl's most-wanted list.

495
01:05:00,137 --> 01:05:02,833
What am I supposed to do?
He's my husband.

496
01:05:02,907 --> 01:05:04,670
I was in love with him.

497
01:05:06,110 --> 01:05:10,012
There's supposed to be
a half million dollars in that saFe.

498
01:05:10,080 --> 01:05:12,048
He must have moved it.

499
01:05:12,116 --> 01:05:14,846
We can Find it.

500
01:05:14,919 --> 01:05:17,479
We can be together.
We can go to Mexico.

501
01:05:17,555 --> 01:05:19,853
Fuck Mexico!

502
01:05:23,093 --> 01:05:24,685
Michael, please...

503
01:05:26,096 --> 01:05:27,620
don't leave me.

504
01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:30,861
We can be together.

505
01:05:51,956 --> 01:05:54,049
Miss Suzanne...

506
01:05:54,124 --> 01:05:57,059
you're as pretty as advertised.

507
01:05:57,127 --> 01:05:59,220
You look pretty near
good enough to eat.

508
01:06:00,764 --> 01:06:02,664
That looks like my gun.

509
01:06:13,744 --> 01:06:15,803
AFternoon, Mike.

510
01:06:18,616 --> 01:06:21,016
Did you have a nice nap?

511
01:06:24,588 --> 01:06:26,749
Did you know that these two...

512
01:06:26,824 --> 01:06:30,351
were a couple
oF Fucking crooks?

513
01:06:30,427 --> 01:06:33,624
Yeah. Suzy here says...

514
01:06:33,697 --> 01:06:37,793
that Wayne was a bookkeeper
in a steel mill in lllinois...

515
01:06:37,868 --> 01:06:41,736
and he Figured out how to walk out
oF that plant with $2 million.

516
01:06:41,805 --> 01:06:44,103
And she says...

517
01:06:44,174 --> 01:06:47,075
there's halF a million
laying around somewhere...

518
01:06:47,144 --> 01:06:51,376
but that Wayner is the only one
that knows where it is.

519
01:06:51,448 --> 01:06:53,643
Now, is that true?

520
01:06:56,954 --> 01:06:58,649
That's what she told me.

521
01:07:01,425 --> 01:07:03,154
IF that's the case...

522
01:07:03,227 --> 01:07:05,661
why don't we all go pay Wayner
a little visit...

523
01:07:05,729 --> 01:07:09,062
and see iF Suzy's story
checks out, okay?

524
01:07:09,133 --> 01:07:10,566
But he's in jail.

525
01:07:10,634 --> 01:07:13,967
Not For long, sweetie pie.
Come on. Get up.

526
01:07:24,415 --> 01:07:27,509
Okay, kids,
don't you go anywhere.

527
01:07:28,319 --> 01:07:30,048
I'll be right back.

528
01:07:39,263 --> 01:07:40,696
I'm really sorry.

529
01:07:40,764 --> 01:07:43,699
You were right.
We shouldn't have come back here.

530
01:07:43,767 --> 01:07:47,965
Let's put a cap on the horseshit
and Figure a way out of this.

531
01:07:48,038 --> 01:07:49,471
Okay?

532
01:07:50,741 --> 01:07:53,039
- Can you get your hands Free?
- No.

533
01:07:53,110 --> 01:07:55,874
The cord's so tight,
my hands are numb.

534
01:07:55,946 --> 01:07:57,573
Just keep moving them.

535
01:08:21,071 --> 01:08:23,505
- Do you still have my car keys?
- I think so. Why?

536
01:08:23,574 --> 01:08:25,838
There's a pocketkniFe
on the key chain.

537
01:08:30,180 --> 01:08:31,613
Well, well, now.

538
01:08:45,429 --> 01:08:46,862
SheriFf's oFFice.

539
01:08:48,098 --> 01:08:49,861
Where?

540
01:08:49,933 --> 01:08:52,197
Yeah, we'll be right there.

541
01:08:52,269 --> 01:08:54,032
Matt, that was Bob Finney.

542
01:08:54,104 --> 01:08:56,538
He said the old Duncan place
is on Fire.

543
01:09:00,944 --> 01:09:03,811
Call the volunteers.
I'll get Russ on the radio.

544
01:09:06,717 --> 01:09:09,015
- You want me to go?
- No, you stay put.

545
01:09:09,086 --> 01:09:10,849

561
01:10:42,646 --> 01:10:44,739
- Anybody inside?
- No.

562
01:10:44,815 --> 01:10:47,409
Wind's not too bad.
We should have this out in no time.

563
01:10:47,484 --> 01:10:50,749
- Does anybody know how it started?
- Not that I know about.

564
01:11:01,165 --> 01:11:03,861
It's turkey.
It's one oF my favorites.

You're in possession oF halF

Smart cop.

Nice driving!
Way to go.

590
01:14:26,937 --> 01:14:29,371
Feels good, don't it?

591
01:14:29,439 --> 01:14:33,205
That old V8 just purrs
like a cat.

592
01:14:33,276 --> 01:14:35,642
Yeah.

593
01:14:37,447 --> 01:14:39,005
How does it Feel?

594
01:14:40,117 --> 01:14:43,177
Happy couple

595
01:14:45,122 --> 01:14:48,319
You two got enough legroom?

596
01:14:56,767 --> 01:14:58,200
Where's the money?

597
01:14:59,803 --> 01:15:02,101
Stay on this road.
I'll telI you when to turn.

598
01:15:02,906 --> 01:15:05,033
Okay, boss.

599
01:15:11,248 --> 01:15:13,682
I just want to ask you one thing.

600
01:15:13,750 --> 01:15:18,153
- How did you ever get to be sherifF?
- I was elected.

601
01:15:18,221 --> 01:15:21,281
No shit.
How did you rig that?

602
01:15:21,358 --> 01:15:24,122
It wasn't hard. He bought
every voter in the county a drink.

603
01:15:25,362 --> 01:15:26,795
No shit?

604
01:15:26,863 --> 01:15:29,957
damn.
Maybe I ought to do that.

605
01:15:30,033 --> 01:15:31,967
Run for sheriFF.

606
01:15:33,770 --> 01:15:35,704
Buy a bar.

607
01:15:37,107 --> 01:15:39,041
What do you think?

608
01:15:41,278 --> 01:15:44,076
- You want a drink?
- No, thanks.

609
01:15:47,784 --> 01:15:49,308
Scotch ain't good enough?

610
01:15:54,791 --> 01:15:57,385
I knew a guy like you once.

611
01:15:59,963 --> 01:16:02,989
Thought he was better
than everybody else.

612
01:16:05,569 --> 01:16:07,503
That's it, ain't it?

613
01:16:12,409 --> 01:16:15,674
You think you're better than me,
don't you?

614
01:16:15,745 --> 01:16:17,440
Why don't you just blow me?

615
01:16:20,083 --> 01:16:25,350
You think you are real hot shit,
don't you?

616
01:16:29,092 --> 01:16:32,528
Cowboy, who's got the gun?

617
01:16:42,239 --> 01:16:45,037
You keep your Foot on the gas.

618
01:16:53,116 --> 01:16:54,947
Choose liFe.

619
01:16:57,287 --> 01:17:00,188
Are we having a good time yet?

620
01:17:00,257 --> 01:17:02,054
Forget all these buttons up here.

621
01:17:02,125 --> 01:17:04,593
Just push that down to talk
and let go to listen.

622
01:17:04,661 --> 01:17:06,094
- You got it?
- Yeah.

623
01:17:06,163 --> 01:17:08,495
Good. Don't worry.
Len's on his way.

624
01:17:08,565 --> 01:17:12,001
Remember, don't touch anything here
until I get back.

625
01:17:12,068 --> 01:17:15,401
- Okay.
- And, Jane, thanks.

626
01:17:17,574 --> 01:17:20,008
- What happened?
- I don't know. I just missed them.

627
01:17:20,076 --> 01:17:22,203
Come on.

628
01:17:22,279 --> 01:17:26,682
HP is sending backup
From Rawlins and Laramie.

629
01:17:26,750 --> 01:17:30,743
- You take 487 East. I'll go west.
- What are we looking For?

630
01:17:30,820 --> 01:17:33,653
A black Buick with Texas plates.

631
01:17:43,066 --> 01:17:46,502
- Now turn oFf your lights.
- What?

632
01:17:46,570 --> 01:17:49,630
Just turn oFF your lights
and make that next right up there.

633
01:17:49,706 --> 01:17:51,037
What are we doing?

634
01:17:51,107 --> 01:17:55,635
See this house here?
It belongs to the caretaker.

635
01:17:59,883 --> 01:18:02,283
I don't want him
to know we're here.

636
01:18:04,087 --> 01:18:06,078
What is this?

637
01:18:06,156 --> 01:18:09,353
This is the last place
anybody would think to look.

638
01:18:13,096 --> 01:18:15,690
Not bad, Wayner.

639
01:18:29,779 --> 01:18:32,111
- You got a shovel?
- In the trunk.

640
01:18:32,182 --> 01:18:36,380
- When do I get these cuFFs oFF?
- When I get the money.

641
01:18:39,222 --> 01:18:41,383
Come on, Mike.
Time For some exercise.

642
01:18:41,458 --> 01:18:43,722
- Where you gonna dig?
- What do you mean?

643
01:18:43,793 --> 01:18:45,727
It's a big graveyard.

644
01:18:47,797 --> 01:18:50,061
What are you saying, Wayne?

645
01:18:50,133 --> 01:18:54,001
Take these cufFs oFF and I'll point you
in the right direction.

646
01:18:55,071 --> 01:18:57,904
I've been working on the railroad

647
01:18:57,974 --> 01:18:59,839
All the livelong day

648
01:19:08,418 --> 01:19:11,080
Can't you dig any Faster?

649
01:19:14,958 --> 01:19:17,518
You're probably thinking
to yourselF...

650
01:19:17,594 --> 01:19:20,358
"How did I end up out here
with this bunch of losers?"

651
01:19:20,430 --> 01:19:24,366
Right?
I'll tell you how.

652
01:19:24,434 --> 01:19:27,028
'Cause you're a thieF.

653
01:19:27,103 --> 01:19:30,231
You wouldn't be here
if you weren't, right?

654
01:19:44,954 --> 01:19:47,718
What do you want to do
with these two?

655
01:19:48,958 --> 01:19:52,758
- We'Il let them go.
- Are you sure about that?

656
01:19:54,631 --> 01:19:57,464
There's no point
in killing them now, is there?

657
01:19:59,135 --> 01:20:04,300
I don't know.
I don't like loose ends.

658
01:20:24,160 --> 01:20:26,993
I hope you remember
the combinations.

659
01:20:28,498 --> 01:20:30,864
Yeah, I do.

660
01:20:30,934 --> 01:20:34,097
But I won't open that box
till you get rid oF the gun.

661
01:20:37,674 --> 01:20:41,269
- You don't trust me?
- Yeah, I trust you.

662
01:20:42,345 --> 01:20:44,279
But, like you said,
we're partners.

663
01:20:44,347 --> 01:20:46,281
You have a gun.
I don't.

664
01:20:48,351 --> 01:20:50,785
That's my deal.
Take it or leave it.

665
01:20:50,854 --> 01:20:54,790
What's to keep me From just shooting
the locks oFF this box?

666
01:20:56,526 --> 01:21:00,656
Or better yet,
I shoot you...

667
01:21:00,730 --> 01:21:04,723
and throw the box
in the trunk.

668
01:21:04,801 --> 01:21:08,828
You could do that,
but what about the caretaker?

669
01:21:08,905 --> 01:21:12,397
He might hear the shot.
He might calI the deputies.

670
01:21:13,643 --> 01:21:16,237
Might get a little messy,
even For you.

671
01:21:19,315 --> 01:21:23,911
You know,
I think you got me all wrong.

672
01:21:23,987 --> 01:21:26,251
I'm not greedy.

673
01:21:26,322 --> 01:21:28,790
Fair is fair.
Right, partner?

674
01:21:28,858 --> 01:21:30,758
Right.

675
01:21:30,827 --> 01:21:32,260
All right.

676
01:21:42,672 --> 01:21:44,105
There you go.

677
01:21:46,843 --> 01:21:48,777
Open the box.

678
01:22:10,967 --> 01:22:14,232
Wayne, you're making a mistake.

679
01:22:16,473 --> 01:22:19,965
You really think
he'll let you keep halF that money?

680
01:22:20,043 --> 01:22:22,238
Mike, that hurt.

681
01:22:28,952 --> 01:22:30,886
Don't worry about me.

682
01:22:38,995 --> 01:22:41,088
I think he'll let me keep it all.

683
01:22:43,566 --> 01:22:46,228
does this mean
that we ain't partners?

684
01:22:46,302 --> 01:22:48,429
Just get away From the car.

685
01:22:48,505 --> 01:22:50,063
Come on.

686
01:22:50,139 --> 01:22:51,572
Move it.

687
01:22:55,178 --> 01:22:57,271
All right.

688
01:22:57,347 --> 01:22:58,837
Get over there.

689
01:23:01,851 --> 01:23:03,148
Move back.

690
