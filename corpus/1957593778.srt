1
00:00:02,274 --> 00:00:04,941
(ambient music)

2
00:00:13,445 --> 00:00:16,862
(bright classical music)

3
00:00:22,526 --> 00:00:25,193
(wine splashes)

4
00:00:30,168 --> 00:00:33,001
(kernels clatter)

5
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:38,307
(door slams)

6
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:43,883
(music swells)

7
00:00:53,235 --> 00:00:56,068
(kernels popping)

8
00:01:00,582 --> 00:01:03,999
(bright classical music)

9
00:01:21,483 --> 00:01:23,573
- [Elisa] Sam, not too much butter!

10
00:01:26,637 --> 00:01:29,470
(butter splashes)

11
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:34,093
Not too much salt!

12
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,923
Don't forget the tape deck!

13
00:01:46,505 --> 00:01:49,023
(remote clicks)

14
00:01:49,023 --> 00:01:50,540
- Popcorn, just the way you like it.

15
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:51,480
- Ah...

16
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:53,883
No, thank you.

17
00:01:53,883 --> 00:01:54,716
- Why not?

18
00:01:54,716 --> 00:01:55,645
- Too much salt.

19
00:01:55,645 --> 00:01:56,478
- How do you know?

20
00:01:56,478 --> 00:01:57,311
You haven't even tried it.

21
00:01:57,311 --> 00:01:58,144
- It's always too much salt.

22
00:01:58,144 --> 00:01:58,977
- I'll get you something to drink.

23
00:01:58,977 --> 00:02:00,300
- No, thank you.

24
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:02,220
- How about I put some
music on the stereo?

25
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:04,170
- No, thank you.

26
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:06,180
(chuckling)
You wanna talk.

27
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:07,548
- Very perceptive.
- Mm-hmm.

28
00:02:07,548 --> 00:02:08,920
- What would I do without you, huh?

29
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,410
- Hm, eat too much
popcorn, too much butter,

30
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:11,243
too much--
(groans)

31
00:02:11,243 --> 00:02:12,750
- I wanna ask you something.

32
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:16,260
You don't think that I'm shallow, do you?

33
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,715
- It doesn't sound like
you have much choice.

34
00:02:20,715 --> 00:02:21,548
(Sam chuckles)

35
00:02:21,548 --> 00:02:23,980
You know, it's a decision made
by the board of directors.

36
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:25,570
But don't you have a say as a partner?

37
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:26,770
- No, no, no.

38
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:28,600
Look, I don't mind
working for another firm.

39
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:31,450
I'm happy to do a good deed for the city.

40
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:32,700
It doesn't even bother
me nobody's gonna make

41
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:34,070
any money on this deal, but you know,

42
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:36,320
they teamed me up with an
architect I've never met,

43
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,640
from some company I've never heard of.

44
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,228
The guy's supposed to be
some kind of a lunatic.

45
00:02:39,228 --> 00:02:40,061
(TV chatters)

46
00:02:40,061 --> 00:02:42,455
- He's an architect, how
much of a lunatic can he be?

47
00:02:42,455 --> 00:02:45,040
- (grunts) NB, he goes by
the initials NB, right?

48
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,560
He works out of some kind
of an abandoned garage.

49
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,800
I get to see, he lives
in a tent up on the roof.

50
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,240
- Well, you always say
architecture's about change.

51
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:55,340
- Yeah, well architecture can
change all at once, all right?

52
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:56,960
I'd like to do my good deed for the city

53
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:00,060
without turning my life inside
out, thank you very much.

54
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:02,662
(Sam grunts)

55
00:03:02,662 --> 00:03:04,740
And the board says, "Well,
we can't work in a garage,

56
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:06,780
so we'll make space for
him and some of his people

57
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:08,580
on your floor, starting this week."

58
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:10,480
We're not jammed up enough down there.

59
00:03:11,324 --> 00:03:14,006
(Sam groans)

60
00:03:14,006 --> 00:03:14,839
- What?

61
00:03:14,839 --> 00:03:17,523
- I think you might be a
teeny, tiny bit shallow.

62
00:03:18,382 --> 00:03:21,408
- (sighs) Let's talk about something else.

63
00:03:21,408 --> 00:03:22,419
- Fine.

64
00:03:22,419 --> 00:03:23,433
- Sex.

65
00:03:23,433 --> 00:03:25,223
- You wanna talk about sex?

66
00:03:25,223 --> 00:03:28,470
- (groans) When's Zoey coming home?

67
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:29,303
- Tomorrow. (kisses)

68
00:03:29,303 --> 00:03:31,570
- Ah, that should be enough time.

69
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:34,128
- Let's make some noise.
(chuckles)

70
00:03:34,128 --> 00:03:36,461
(kisses)
Mm.

71
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,660
Well, all I can do is give you my opinion.

72
00:03:42,567 --> 00:03:43,400
(phone rings)
No, no,

73
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:46,430
you're absolutely right,
(stammers) it's totally subjective.

74
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:48,230
Yeah.
(phone rings)

75
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:50,730
All right, well look, we
wanna wish you the best.

76
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:52,320
All right, yeah, sure. (phone clicks)

77
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,300
What do you wanna bet they go
through a dozen architects,

78
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,400
they'll still hate the building?

79
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,233
- No bet.

80
00:03:56,233 --> 00:03:57,927
Chairman of the Asian Heritage Council.

81
00:03:57,927 --> 00:03:58,760
- (sighs) Yeah.

82
00:03:58,760 --> 00:03:59,593
- And--

83
00:03:59,593 --> 00:04:00,942
- Wait, wait, wait, what is it?

84
00:04:00,942 --> 00:04:02,020
These are the calls
just from this morning?

85
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:03,250
- Friday; the chairman's--

86
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:04,420
- Well, why didn't I see them on Friday?

87
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:05,570
- Because you weren't here.

88
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:06,403
- Where was I?

89
00:04:06,403 --> 00:04:08,522
- You were playing golf
with Elisa at Meadowlands.

90
00:04:08,522 --> 00:04:09,355
- Yeah, that's right.
(phone rings)

91
00:04:09,355 --> 00:04:10,380
- Well, you know, memory loss is part

92
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:11,490
of the normal aging process.

93
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:12,760
- Well, thank you for sharing that.

94
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,383
I'm sorry, what's your name again?

95
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:17,240
All right, fellas, let's start

96
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,290
with the chairman of the Asian, whatever.

97
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:27,570
- Crap, crap, crap.
(phone rings)

98
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:29,350
- [Elisa] Something wrong, Bess?

99
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:30,710
- I bet if I had sex more often,

100
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:32,170
I wouldn't be so disorganized.

101
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:33,003
- Really?

102
00:04:33,003 --> 00:04:35,020
I didn't know there was a
correlation between, what is it?

103
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:38,450
Frequency of intercourse and
organizational skills? (laughs)

104
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:39,440
- Go ahead, laugh.

105
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,680
You're married to a man who
can't keep his hands off you.

106
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,570
Look at your desk.
(chuckles)

107
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:44,430
I'm married to a guy who
pats me on the shoulder

108
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:48,000
every fiscal quarter, and I
just scheduled two school tours

109
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,250
on the same day, at the same time.

110
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:51,960
- Bring me the paperwork,
I'll see what I can do.

111
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,090
- Don't you think you oughta stop

112
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:54,480
this volunteer saint routine

113
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,830
and take the paying job they're offering?

114
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:58,420
- If I take the paying job,
I have less flexibility.

115
00:04:58,420 --> 00:04:59,253
- [Bess] And a bigger office.

116
00:04:59,253 --> 00:05:00,480
- And that means less time with Sam!

117
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,020
Besides, I hear they
already hired somebody.

118
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:04,020
- They hired someone else for your job?

119
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:05,580
- Bess, this is my job.
(phone rings)

120
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:07,510
And I have more than enough work to do,

121
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:08,920
so why don't you get me your paperwork

122
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,830
so I can get back to mine?

123
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:13,290
- In 30 years, I never understood you.

124
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:15,408
- [Employee] Metropolitan Art Museum.

125
00:05:15,408 --> 00:05:16,241
(upbeat piano music)

126
00:05:16,241 --> 00:05:17,610
- Yeah, you're absolutely right, Zoey.

127
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:19,270
You are treated differently
because you're my daughter.

128
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:21,273
Anybody else who was this
late would have been fired!

129
00:05:21,273 --> 00:05:23,773
(phone rings)

130
00:05:24,992 --> 00:05:26,483
Look, I'm not saying that it's--

131
00:05:26,483 --> 00:05:28,076
- Dad, I got the message!

132
00:05:28,076 --> 00:05:30,070
- You're the only intern
we have around here.

133
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:31,420
You happen to be my daughter,
it just doesn't look good.

134
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:33,960
- Okay, okay, okay, okay!

135
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:34,793
How do I look?

136
00:05:34,793 --> 00:05:37,170
- You look fine, how do I look?

137
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,305
- Uptight, (sighs) as usual.

138
00:05:39,305 --> 00:05:40,879
(sighs)
Hi, how are you?

139
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:42,334
- Zoey!
- How are you?

140
00:05:42,334 --> 00:05:46,536
(talking over each other)
- Guys, sorry we're late.

141
00:05:46,536 --> 00:05:49,536
(jazzy piano music)

142
00:06:30,427 --> 00:06:34,630
(sniffs)
(phone rings)

143
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:36,690
- Maybe I should call again.

144
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:38,260
- Why don't we just reschedule?

145
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:39,900
I really, I have a lot of stuff that uh--

146
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:43,348
- NB!
(phone clatters)

147
00:06:43,348 --> 00:06:44,181
(door slams)
(panting)

148
00:06:44,181 --> 00:06:45,860
- Very late and very sorry.

149
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:47,068
- You're a woman.

150
00:06:47,068 --> 00:06:49,110
- Yeah. (pants)

151
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:50,780
There was an old man, crossing

152
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:52,330
on the crosswalk in front of my car.

153
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:54,740
One minute he was upright,
the next minute he was down.

154
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:56,777
I dialed 911, four firetrucks arrived

155
00:06:56,777 --> 00:06:59,870
and the paramedics started
treating him for heart failure.

156
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:01,232
Turned out, he had gas.

157
00:07:01,232 --> 00:07:03,180
(employees laugh)

158
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:05,840
I'm Nell Bergen, a woman.

159
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,573
You must be Sam Mercer, the man.

160
00:07:08,413 --> 00:07:09,247
(phone rings)

161
00:07:09,247 --> 00:07:10,847
- Ah, this is my daughter, Zoey.

162
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:13,400
- How do you do? (sighs)

163
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,250
You're an architect?

164
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:16,170
- Yeah no, actually she's our new intern.

165
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:17,440
- Well, an aspiring architect.

166
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,170
- She's a sociology major at Brown.

167
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:20,980
She's taking a semester off.

168
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:21,833
- Can she talk?

169
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:25,010
- As a matter of fact, I can.

170
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:27,270
My field is urban social dynamics.

171
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:29,370
- Good, well when you
graduate, you can come and work

172
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:30,360
at the center we design.
- Hm.

173
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,920
- It's gonna be really terrific,

174
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,800
and I don't just mean the way it looks.

175
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,810
You've met my assistant, David Su.

176
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:38,430
Miss Cora Windsor, who
of course is very modest,

177
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:41,730
but in truth came up with the
entire idea for the center.

178
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:43,973
- Nell had some good ideas, as I recall.

179
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:47,630
- So what did you talk
about before I arrived?

180
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:51,210
- The uh, Lovell House, Neutra, 1927.

181
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:54,610
- Ah, very close, but it
took two years to build.

182
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:57,180
Completion date was 1929.

183
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:59,620
If this project is as
successful as we hope,

184
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:02,310
it could become a model for
community centers nationwide.

185
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:03,200
- Really?

186
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,380
- Yes.
(papers rustle)

187
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:07,410
Don't you know about the center?

188
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:09,780
- No, not much, not really.

189
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:12,892
Don't your interns get
briefed on ongoing projects?

190
00:08:12,892 --> 00:08:15,440
- (grunts) Well, usually they do but--

191
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,250
- Wait, aren't you the
one who never turned up

192
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:19,600
for any of the meetings
we had on this project?

193
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:23,358
- I guess I must be.

194
00:08:23,358 --> 00:08:25,634
(chuckles)
- Hm.

195
00:08:25,634 --> 00:08:26,467
(Zoey chuckles)

196
00:08:26,467 --> 00:08:29,570
- Well, on the face of it, it's
a regular recreation center

197
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:31,190
but applicants have to attend classes,

198
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:32,860
given on the premises at no charge,

199
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:34,760
designed to teach life lessons.

200
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:37,100
When a member has completed
all the classes offered,

201
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,960
they can remain at the center
by becoming a volunteer.

202
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:42,410
- Wow, that sounds really great.

203
00:08:42,410 --> 00:08:46,380
- What is not clear to
me is how you get a feel

204
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:48,560
of what needs to happen architecturally

205
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,840
when you haven't the faintest idea of

206
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:52,090
what the structure you're
designing is about.

207
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:57,170
(jazzy piano music)

208
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:07,720
- She's not that weird.

209
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,818
Nell is (stammers) dynamic.

210
00:09:09,818 --> 00:09:11,880
- Dynamic, she's a
dynamic pain in the ass.

211
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:12,713
She's been there for a week.

212
00:09:12,713 --> 00:09:14,180
She's rearranged the coffee room already.

213
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:15,180
- Everyone says it's better.

214
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,580
- Uh-huh, well, she
put these humongous set

215
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:19,220
of stereo speakers in her office.

216
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:21,041
- She uses music as an inspiration.

217
00:09:21,041 --> 00:09:22,070
- Oh. (scoffs)

218
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:23,550
- She, a lot of people do!

219
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:24,970
Zack does it when he sky dives.

220
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:26,350
- Oh, I see. (stammers)

221
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:27,905
She wears napkins in her hair.

222
00:09:27,905 --> 00:09:28,738
- What? (laughing)

223
00:09:28,738 --> 00:09:31,950
- They're not napkins,
Dad, they're bandanas.

224
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:33,350
- They're napkins, okay?

225
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:34,830
I saw him 'em at Bess and Murray's picnic.

226
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:36,020
We used 'em to wipe our mouth,

227
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:36,853
they're napkins.
- Okay.

228
00:09:36,853 --> 00:09:39,080
- Look, (stammers) she's got her own style

229
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,030
and she's successful.
(knife clicks)

230
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:42,140
And she wasn't wrong about you missing

231
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:43,910
those community meetings, either.

232
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:45,600
- Oh, she wasn't, huh?

233
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,893
- I wouldn't mind being
like her when I grow up.

234
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:49,920
- Oh now, that's a hell of a thing to say

235
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:50,974
right here in front of your mother.

236
00:09:50,974 --> 00:09:52,780
- Oh.

237
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:55,090
- Dad, there are other women
in the world besides Mom.

238
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:57,781
- I love it when you two talk
about me like I'm not here.

239
00:09:57,781 --> 00:10:01,370
- (scoffs) Besides, I
didn't say Nell was better.

240
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:02,615
She's just different.

241
00:10:02,615 --> 00:10:03,448
(Sam scoffs)

242
00:10:03,448 --> 00:10:06,160
- Yeah, she really is or she tries to be?

243
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,230
- Aha.

244
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:10,180
- She doesn't see things
like other people, you know?

245
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:12,570
She's, (stammers) I don't know, real...

246
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:14,180
alive!
- Hmm.

247
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:15,640
- You'd like her, mom.

248
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,810
- Oh yeah, yeah, you'd love her.

249
00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:20,015
- She thinks Dad's a stuffy old fart.

250
00:10:20,015 --> 00:10:20,853
- Zoey!

251
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:24,737
I've known that about
your father for years.

252
00:10:24,737 --> 00:10:26,650
(chuckling)
- Hey, hey, hey, hey!

253
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,390
- How do we know this
isn't just some showcase

254
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:33,700
for your businesses to come
in here, put up a bunch

255
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:36,920
of walls and hang plaques
of who donated what?

256
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:37,753
- You don't.

257
00:10:37,753 --> 00:10:40,130
Which is why you all need
to muster up some trust,

258
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:42,620
mix it with some
responsibility, and participate

259
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:44,910
in this project so walls
of plaques don't happen.

260
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:47,848
- A lot of promises made to
this community been broken.

261
00:10:47,848 --> 00:10:49,080
- Yeah, tell 'em.
- That's right!

262
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:53,670
- Hold it, now, nobody up
here is denying the fact

263
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:56,680
that this community has been treated badly

264
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,362
for too many years.
- Mm-hmm.

265
00:10:58,362 --> 00:10:59,195
(crowd murmurs)

266
00:10:59,195 --> 00:11:02,660
Just as nobody up here
can absolutely guarantee

267
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:04,580
that every promise that you've heard today

268
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:06,100
is going to be kept.

269
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:06,933
- That's what I'm sayin'!

270
00:11:06,933 --> 00:11:08,250
- But I will promise you this.

271
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:10,470
This recreation center
is going to be built.

272
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:12,893
- Yeah, right.
- Which is why we're here.

273
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,330
I mean, we're here because
we want your participation.

274
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:17,560
We want your ideas.

275
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:20,150
We want your comments,
we want your complaints.

276
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:21,430
We want your help.
(siren wails)

277
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:25,030
Now, I don't know if this
suggestion has been made yet

278
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:27,920
because I missed the earlier meetings,

279
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,190
for which I apologize.
(crowd murmurs)

280
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:32,370
Suppose we set up a
separate telephone line

281
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:35,470
and we plaster the phone number
all over the neighborhood.

282
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:37,150
Right, then if anybody's got any ideas

283
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:39,020
or comments or criticisms, all they have

284
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:41,913
to do is pick up the phone and call it in.

285
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:45,496
What do you think?

286
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:47,483
(talking over each other)
- I don't know.

287
00:11:47,483 --> 00:11:50,566
- I think it's a great idea.
- Uh-huh.

288
00:11:57,055 --> 00:12:00,230
(car sputters)

289
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:01,125
- [Nell] Try it again.

290
00:12:01,125 --> 00:12:01,958
- 'Kay.

291
00:12:03,181 --> 00:12:06,140
(car sputters)

292
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:06,973
No.

293
00:12:06,973 --> 00:12:08,370
- [Nell] Ah, I'm gonna need a tow.

294
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:10,320
- Okay, I'll see if I can find a phone.

295
00:12:12,486 --> 00:12:16,088
- Wa-hoo!
(truck rumbles)

296
00:12:16,088 --> 00:12:18,838
(brakes screech)

297
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:25,990
Hey, sweet thing.
(country music)

298
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:26,823
Nice wheels.

299
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:31,010
- Thanks, you think so?

300
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:33,083
- I'm a parts expert, I know so.

301
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:35,160
- Well I ought to tell you,

302
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,820
I'm not interested in a casual liaison.

303
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:41,120
I'm looking for a serious,
long-term commitment.

304
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,303
Are you interested?

305
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:46,992
- Let's go, Luther.
(truck rumbles)

306
00:12:46,992 --> 00:12:50,313
- (laughs) Works every time.

307
00:12:52,873 --> 00:12:55,290
(hood slams)

308
00:12:57,650 --> 00:12:59,557
I'm starved, let's eat.

309
00:12:59,557 --> 00:13:02,495
(Sam sighs)

310
00:13:02,495 --> 00:13:04,912
(calm music)

311
00:13:06,001 --> 00:13:08,084
Mm, excellent, thank you.

312
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:11,000
- You always eat other people's food?

313
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:11,833
- Well, if they offer.

314
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:13,590
Is your wife always out at dinner time?

315
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,580
- Uh, my wife's at a meeting.

316
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:19,270
She's a volunteer at the museum,
and she's a gourmet cook.

317
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:22,279
- I'm a horrible cook,
but I'm a gourmet eater.

318
00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:24,010
(chuckles)
- Mm.

319
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:25,290
After ruling out some places that

320
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:26,810
should probably be closed
to health authorities,

321
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:29,160
I finally found great
takeout 'round the office.

322
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,450
- Oh, (chuckles) you like takeout?

323
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:32,600
- Yep, I love takeout.

324
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,953
And working late, and small adventures.

325
00:13:38,824 --> 00:13:40,550
(Sam clears throat)

326
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:42,110
- If you appreciate things
that are young and tender,

327
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:44,560
the baby squid is excellent,
would you like some?

328
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:47,706
Thanks for the lift, by the way.

329
00:13:47,706 --> 00:13:48,539
- Uh, it's okay.

330
00:13:52,427 --> 00:13:55,883
And I have to say that those gentlemen,

331
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,853
well, they weren't wrong about you.

332
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:05,980
Wheels, uh, legs.
(chuckles)

333
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:10,893
- Well, here's to conflict resolution.

334
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:14,540
Architectural and otherwise.

335
00:14:16,032 --> 00:14:20,076
(crowd chatters)
(glasses clink)

336
00:14:20,076 --> 00:14:23,481
(both slurping)

337
00:14:23,481 --> 00:14:24,314
- Ah.

338
00:14:30,252 --> 00:14:33,752
(bright percussive music)

339
00:14:37,683 --> 00:14:40,200
Workin' late on a Friday.

340
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,033
- You're working, too.

341
00:14:41,033 --> 00:14:46,033
- Ah, well, Zoey and her mother

342
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:49,535
are on kind of a ladies' night out.

343
00:14:49,535 --> 00:14:51,293
You know, so here I am.

344
00:14:51,293 --> 00:14:53,360
- That was a very
interesting lecture you gave

345
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,290
at the library last week.

346
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:57,838
- Oh, thank you, I didn't see you there.

347
00:14:57,838 --> 00:14:59,170
- Well, I was draped in black.

348
00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:01,613
Didn't want you to be
distracted by my legs.

349
00:15:01,613 --> 00:15:05,000
- Uh-huh. (chuckles)

350
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,570
Tell me something, you
really like this music?

351
00:15:07,570 --> 00:15:10,623
I mean, that's surprises me. (snickers)

352
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:13,590
- What surprises me is
that we're working together

353
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:16,250
on a rather large project,
and you don't have the,

354
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:18,803
the slightest clue about my
work or what it means to me.

355
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,530
- Well then, why don't you tell me?

356
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:22,680
- Why don't I show you?

357
00:15:24,936 --> 00:15:25,980
- Are we going somewhere?

358
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:27,533
- Yep.
(bright percussive music)

359
00:15:27,533 --> 00:15:30,283
A visit to a genuine
architectural treasure.

360
00:15:32,184 --> 00:15:33,017
(stereo clicks off)

361
00:15:33,017 --> 00:15:34,895
- Ah, that's much better.

362
00:15:34,895 --> 00:15:36,596
I bet you like rap music too, right?

363
00:15:36,596 --> 00:15:38,300
- (chuckles) Absolutely,
especially the ones

364
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:40,793
about judgmental, male architects.

365
00:15:44,857 --> 00:15:47,720
(crickets chirping)

366
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:52,720
(gate creaks)
(dog barks distantly)

367
00:15:53,032 --> 00:15:58,032
(gentle acoustic music)
(laughing)

368
00:16:03,559 --> 00:16:04,570
(crickets chirping)

369
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:06,020
I sneak in here all the time.

370
00:16:08,263 --> 00:16:10,203
I found a reference to it in a book.

371
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:15,620
Took me forever to find it.
(leaves crackle)

372
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:18,770
Used to be huge, then they
developed the property

373
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:20,170
and this is all that's left.

374
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:26,640
There's nothing else
like it from the period,

375
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:27,820
which from the materials used

376
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,893
and some of the building techniques,

377
00:16:29,893 --> 00:16:32,673
I think it's probably about 30 years old.

378
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,440
Sam, when I work, my feelings come first.

379
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,090
From them come design and theory.

380
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,553
For me, this place has a solid feeling.

381
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:46,260
Design and theory are definitely here,

382
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:47,793
but I bet they came last.

383
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,050
- Actually, it's 32 years.

384
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:51,883
- Hm?

385
00:16:54,073 --> 00:16:57,572
- It was a competition to
design a park for an urban lot.

386
00:16:57,572 --> 00:16:59,100
(Sam chuckles)

387
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:01,620
I was 20, I was a lot more
interested in the cash prize

388
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:05,220
than in expressing my feelings,
but I'm glad you like it.

389
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:06,720
- Get out of here.

390
00:17:09,233 --> 00:17:11,410
This is your treasure?

391
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:12,243
- Swear to God.

392
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:16,615
It's too bad they kinda let it go.

393
00:17:16,615 --> 00:17:19,198
(gentle music)

394
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,540
You really live in a tent?

395
00:17:25,123 --> 00:17:26,566
- I used to.

396
00:17:26,566 --> 00:17:29,805
(Sam chuckles)

397
00:17:29,805 --> 00:17:32,888
(bright piano music)

398
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:59,357
(thoughtful music)

399
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:06,530
(hurried footsteps)
(gate creaks)

400
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:14,953
- Sam?

401
00:18:16,432 --> 00:18:17,265
Sam!

402
00:18:18,415 --> 00:18:22,885
Sam, you're late!
(heels clicking)

403
00:18:22,885 --> 00:18:23,965
- Ah, yeah, okay.

404
00:18:23,965 --> 00:18:24,798
- Are you all right?

405
00:18:24,798 --> 00:18:25,756
- Yeah, I'm fine, yeah.

406
00:18:25,756 --> 00:18:27,978
- (sighs) Just do me a favor.

407
00:18:27,978 --> 00:18:29,390
It took me a long time
to get used to living

408
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:31,060
with the most punctual man on Earth.

409
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:32,680
Don't change on me now.

410
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:33,870
Mother's making you breakfast.

411
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:35,700
Come on, hurry up, it's gonna get cold!

412
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:38,164
Come on. (pats)
- Okay, okay, okay!

413
00:18:38,164 --> 00:18:41,331
(weatherman chatters)

414
00:18:48,978 --> 00:18:51,107
(sighs)
(TV zaps)

415
00:18:51,107 --> 00:18:51,940
- Where's Zoey?

416
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:52,773
- I don't know, why?
(scoffs)

417
00:18:52,773 --> 00:18:53,670
She said she was stuck.

418
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:55,520
You know, everybody is a
little off this morning.

419
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,660
- I hope I'm not included in that review.

420
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:59,220
- If you don't overcook Sam's eggs.

421
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:01,430
He is late, ooh, is he cranky.

422
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:03,050
- Could be male menopause.

423
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:04,023
- Excuse me.
- Mm!

424
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:06,090
I saw it on "Oprah," this man

425
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:06,923
was in terrible shape.
- Mother,

426
00:19:06,923 --> 00:19:09,440
Sam does not have male menopause.

427
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,380
- Who's got menopause?

428
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:12,710
- Nobody has menopause, eat, eat, eat!

429
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:15,086
- Good morning, everybody.
- Ah, my Lord.

430
00:19:15,086 --> 00:19:17,300
- Oh, you do lay the best eggs, Janet,

431
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:19,230
but I don't have time.
- Oh, Sam.

432
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:20,680
- Coffee, that's what I need.

433
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:22,470
Waggin', Zo-Zo.

434
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:26,010
- You know, it would be different
if you weren't my father.

435
00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:27,370
- What would it be different?

436
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:28,470
- Being late.

437
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:30,879
I mean, it's not a
crime, Zoey, it's just--

438
00:19:30,879 --> 00:19:34,570
- Zo, Zo, move your ass.

439
00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:35,883
Bye everybody, see ya later.

440
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:38,790
- Hey, hey, hey, what
about my goodbye kiss?

441
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:41,090
- [Janet] It's important for
families to eat together.

442
00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:44,195
It helps children bond to their parents.

443
00:19:44,195 --> 00:19:45,028
- [Elisa] Bye!

444
00:19:47,514 --> 00:19:49,453
- (sighs) Fine.

445
00:19:52,724 --> 00:19:57,724
(phone rings)
(employees chatter)

446
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,580
- Oh, here he comes now, just a moment.

447
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:04,580
Sam, there's a Mr. Bentley who
would like to speak with you.

448
00:20:08,577 --> 00:20:12,400
- Boy, you certainly have a lot of awards.

449
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:15,080
- It's not my idea. (mutters)

450
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:18,130
My, my wife decorated my office and uh,

451
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:19,830
what can I say, she's proud of me.

452
00:20:21,403 --> 00:20:22,236
(intercom beeps)

453
00:20:22,236 --> 00:20:23,620
- [Phyllis] Sam, a contractor,
Mr. Bentley is here.

454
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:25,691
He says he won't leave
until he can speak to you.

455
00:20:25,691 --> 00:20:27,893
- (sighs) Just tell him I'm not here.

456
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:30,540
Uh, look...

457
00:20:32,633 --> 00:20:33,806
Look, I think that we uh--

458
00:20:33,806 --> 00:20:37,160
(knocking)
(sighs)

459
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,640
- He saw you come in.

460
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,400
Also there's a presentation in
the board room in 20 minutes.

461
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,947
- If that's Nick Bentley, just tell him

462
00:20:42,947 --> 00:20:45,120
I'm the other architect on the project.

463
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,370
I think he'll go quietly.

464
00:20:47,393 --> 00:20:48,226
(phone rings)

465
00:20:48,226 --> 00:20:49,763
- And close the door, Phyllis.

466
00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:55,420
- He botched up a job of mine.

467
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:57,130
I almost had to get his license revoked.

468
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:58,723
So you better stay on my good side.

469
00:21:01,685 --> 00:21:04,268
(Sam chuckles)

470
00:21:05,263 --> 00:21:09,430
- I'm a happily married
man, that's why I stopped.

471
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,840
I've never met anybody like you.

472
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:21,130
Obviously, I find you (sighs)

473
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:22,933
very attractive and very smart and,

474
00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:26,200
if things were different--

475
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,360
- I was married once
for a couple of minutes.

476
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:29,620
He was a poet.

477
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:32,523
He wrote about our marriage
instead of participating in it.

478
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:35,340
Being the only child of two dead parents,

479
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:36,610
I sort of thought having a husband

480
00:21:36,610 --> 00:21:38,683
might be good company, but I was wrong.

481
00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:42,300
Anyway, I'm glad you stopped.

482
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:44,210
It's not my style.

483
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:49,965
I almost never sleep--

484
00:21:49,965 --> 00:21:52,730
- (knocking) Hi!

485
00:21:52,730 --> 00:21:54,123
- With interns' fathers.

486
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:59,339
- If I forgot anything, I'm
gonna kill myself. (sighs)

487
00:21:59,339 --> 00:22:00,560
Hi, Nell.
- Hi.

488
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:01,493
- Nice shoes!

489
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,920
Like 'em, Dad?

490
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:06,180
- Yeah, yeah, I liked 'em when I wore 'em

491
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:08,590
in the service too.
(laughs)

492
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:10,090
- I wear 'em 'cause I like 'em.

493
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:10,923
- Good.

494
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:17,203
- Listen, uh, I have
work to do, so if you...

495
00:22:21,058 --> 00:22:22,260
(phone rings)
- Bye.

496
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:23,570
- [Sam] Bye!

497
00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:24,720
- [Zoey] Dad said you grew up in Europe.

498
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,910
- [Nell] Yeah, have you been?

499
00:22:25,910 --> 00:22:27,280
- [Zoey] No, not yet.

500
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,066
- Oh, at your age, you should go.

501
00:22:29,066 --> 00:22:34,066
(phone rings)
(employees chatter)

502
00:22:35,292 --> 00:22:37,792
(door creaks)

503
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:40,880
- [Zoey] Who died?

504
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,080
- Huh, what do you mean?

505
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:45,690
- Well, it looks like a funeral inside.

506
00:22:45,690 --> 00:22:48,420
- [Elisa] Oh no, your
father brought me flowers.

507
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:51,100
- Yeah, it's an old fashioned
custom between men and women,

508
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:53,209
Zo, you wouldn't know anything about it.

509
00:22:53,209 --> 00:22:55,680
It's before Zack's time.

510
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:58,180
- How come you got flowers
if you're going out of town?

511
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:01,140
Oh Mom, Nell Bergen
was wearing these shoes

512
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:03,440
that Dad could not handle.

513
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,920
- That bad?

514
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:07,287
- Well, it went with the
rest of her outfit, I guess.

515
00:23:07,287 --> 00:23:08,140
- [Elisa] Huh?

516
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:11,040
- Right, was he always this conservative?

517
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,107
- Oh, no.

518
00:23:12,107 --> 00:23:14,222
- No, as a matter of fact, he wasn't.

519
00:23:14,222 --> 00:23:15,055
(Elisa chuckles)

520
00:23:15,055 --> 00:23:17,150
- I'm starving, what's for dinner?

521
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:20,160
- Whatever Dad wants.
- Whatever Dad wants!

522
00:23:24,362 --> 00:23:26,862
(door creaks)

523
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:32,408
(jazzy piano music)

524
00:23:59,384 --> 00:24:01,890
- [Employee] Good morning, Mr. Mercer.

525
00:24:25,579 --> 00:24:26,679
- (clears throat) Hey!

526
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,156
- How was your vacation?

527
00:24:29,156 --> 00:24:30,713
- Uh, it was great.

528
00:24:30,713 --> 00:24:33,976
(stammers) I was gone.

529
00:24:33,976 --> 00:24:34,949
- Are you all right, Sam?

530
00:24:34,949 --> 00:24:35,983
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

531
00:24:35,983 --> 00:24:38,504
Listen, do you think--

532
00:24:38,504 --> 00:24:41,750
David, how ya doin', hey, you look great.

533
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:42,583
- Thanks.

534
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:48,930
- You know, I wanted
to ask you, (stammers)

535
00:24:48,930 --> 00:24:50,560
that earring that you wear in your nose,

536
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:51,520
does that thing hurt?

537
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,450
- It's a nose ring, I can't feel it.

538
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:55,140
- Oh, well that's good,
that's good, that's good.

539
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:57,318
What I mean, that's good
that can't, can't feel it.

540
00:24:57,318 --> 00:25:00,911
(stammers) I'll talk to you later.

541
00:25:00,911 --> 00:25:03,911
(jazzy piano music)

542
00:25:07,173 --> 00:25:09,673
(phone rings)

543
00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:27,323
- I thought you had a policy about

544
00:25:27,323 --> 00:25:29,813
never mixing work and pleasure.

545
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:32,413
- I do.

546
00:25:32,413 --> 00:25:34,393
- Oh, so what's that smell?

547
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:37,453
- That what?

548
00:25:37,453 --> 00:25:39,920
- Smell, as in scent?

549
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,310
Like when animals have the hots

550
00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:43,880
for each other and they release an odor?

551
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:46,980
- David, (laughs) has
anyone ever told you,

552
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:49,020
you are a bizarre human being?

553
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:51,010
- My parents, well all
my relatives, actually.

554
00:25:51,010 --> 00:25:52,530
Let's see, the United States military

555
00:25:52,530 --> 00:25:54,820
and I think you've mentioned it before.

556
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:57,210
- No doubt, I'm going to have coffee.

557
00:25:57,210 --> 00:25:58,310
- I'd love to join ya.

558
00:26:01,777 --> 00:26:02,610
- Okay.

559
00:26:04,228 --> 00:26:06,645
(Nell sighs)

560
00:26:07,770 --> 00:26:10,010
So we got carried away for a moment.

561
00:26:10,010 --> 00:26:12,823
Nothing of any real
consequence and it's over.

562
00:26:14,090 --> 00:26:14,923
- And?

563
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:18,300
- And he's happily married
and I'm happily divorced

564
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:21,040
and anyway, I must have
a bug or something.

565
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:23,130
I don't feel up to another
(speaks foreign language).

566
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:23,963
- You sure?

567
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:25,950
- I'm actually tired.

568
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:27,070
- Maybe you're at that age where you need

569
00:26:27,070 --> 00:26:28,870
to start taking iron.

570
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:31,743
- Thank you, David!
(chuckles)

571
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:35,313
- You know, repression can be exhausting.

572
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:41,607
You may have doused the
flame, but the fire isn't out.

573
00:26:45,027 --> 00:26:48,040
(clicks tongue)
(papers rustle)

574
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:50,920
- I don't know why I let
you talk me into these.

575
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,570
You shouldn't have pressured me.

576
00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:54,710
I just hate it when you do that.

577
00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:55,890
Now I'm going to have to return these

578
00:26:55,890 --> 00:26:57,220
before the sale's over.

579
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:58,800
- You're crazy, they're great!

580
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:02,330
- Yeah, well maybe,
but Sam won't like 'em.

581
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:04,630
- Sam isn't going to wear them.

582
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:05,640
- I'm taking them back.

583
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:09,104
- Well, I'm not taking this back.

584
00:27:09,104 --> 00:27:13,910
- (gasps) Well, Murray will
certainly appreciate that.

585
00:27:13,910 --> 00:27:17,363
- He might, but I know someone
else who definitely will.

586
00:27:18,572 --> 00:27:19,405
- Who?

587
00:27:20,570 --> 00:27:22,520
Bess, who are you talking about?

588
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:23,580
(phone rings)
(heels click)

589
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:24,503
Bess!

590
00:27:26,307 --> 00:27:28,807
(car rumbles)

591
00:27:40,634 --> 00:27:45,634
(laughing)
(talking over each other)

592
00:27:46,055 --> 00:27:49,472
(men chatting distantly)

593
00:27:50,783 --> 00:27:53,763
(car doors slam)

594
00:27:53,763 --> 00:27:57,624
(men laughing and chatting)

595
00:27:57,624 --> 00:28:00,291
(ominous music)

596
00:28:08,303 --> 00:28:11,303
(suspenseful music)

597
00:28:14,992 --> 00:28:17,575
(men laughing)

598
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:25,720
(elevator dings)
(men chatting)

599
00:28:27,879 --> 00:28:30,830
(suspenseful music)

600
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:31,960
- Yeah, well somebody better check it out

601
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:34,697
before somebody gets hurt! (slams phone)

602
00:28:34,697 --> 00:28:36,300
(elevator dings)

603
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:37,133
- Sam!

604
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:42,120
Got some bonafide neighborhood guys

605
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,420
to help us with our plans.

606
00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:48,447
This is Sam, he's the
big cheese around here

607
00:28:48,447 --> 00:28:51,383
and he is very, very serious.

608
00:28:54,797 --> 00:28:55,797
To the left.

609
00:28:59,807 --> 00:29:00,640
(Sam sighs)

610
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,010
- Ay yo, Sam.

611
00:29:02,010 --> 00:29:02,843
Chill, man.

612
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:08,923
- Chill means relax.

613
00:29:10,404 --> 00:29:12,110
(phone rings)

614
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:13,593
- [Employee] Did you
schedule that appointment?

615
00:29:14,814 --> 00:29:17,231
(Sam sighs)

616
00:29:22,515 --> 00:29:23,348
- Hi, Dad.

617
00:29:23,348 --> 00:29:24,758
- Hey, pumpkin, how 'bout some popcorn?

618
00:29:24,758 --> 00:29:26,870
- Oh, it'll probably
give me food poisoning.

619
00:29:26,870 --> 00:29:28,350
- What are you talking about, my popcorn?

620
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:29,183
- Oh, don't take it personally.

621
00:29:29,183 --> 00:29:31,520
It's just the kinda day I had.

622
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,570
First I broke the coffee machine.

623
00:29:33,570 --> 00:29:34,403
- You what?

624
00:29:34,403 --> 00:29:36,090
- The one at work. (chuckles)

625
00:29:36,090 --> 00:29:39,660
Then, I picked up the wrong
plans for the fountain project.

626
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:42,010
Now they can't get the
right ones until Monday.

627
00:29:42,970 --> 00:29:47,180
And after I got yelled at for
that, Nell canceled lunch.

628
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:48,173
- Who did?
- She was gonna turn me on to

629
00:29:48,173 --> 00:29:51,450
this great soul food restaurant
near the community center.

630
00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:54,443
But she went to the doctor instead.

631
00:29:54,443 --> 00:29:55,276
- Huh.

632
00:29:55,276 --> 00:29:56,620
- David said it's a
miracle she went at all

633
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:58,210
because she really is the opposite

634
00:29:58,210 --> 00:30:00,358
of a hypochondriac, whatever that is.

635
00:30:00,358 --> 00:30:01,590
- Christian scientist.

636
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:03,292
(Zoey chuckles)

637
00:30:03,292 --> 00:30:04,125
- You wanna go with us?

638
00:30:04,125 --> 00:30:05,940
- What, to the doctor?

639
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:08,254
- No, to the soul food restaurant.

640
00:30:08,254 --> 00:30:10,120
- Yeah, yeah, sounds like fun.

641
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,611
- You're a good guy, Dad.

642
00:30:11,611 --> 00:30:14,627
Mwah!
(heels click)

643
00:30:14,627 --> 00:30:17,651
- (sighs) Yeah.

644
00:30:17,651 --> 00:30:20,634
(thoughtful music)
(shower splashes)

645
00:30:20,634 --> 00:30:23,217
(buttons beep)

646
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:29,800
(phone rings)

647
00:30:36,745 --> 00:30:37,741
- [Nell Recording] Hello,

648
00:30:37,741 --> 00:30:40,066
you've reached the
residence of Princess Di.

649
00:30:40,066 --> 00:30:42,910
Please leave your message after the tone.

650
00:30:42,910 --> 00:30:46,120
Oh, and if this is Charles,
don't bother to call back.

651
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:46,953
(door clicks)

652
00:30:46,953 --> 00:30:49,703
(phone clatters)

653
00:30:53,549 --> 00:30:58,134
(melancholy music)
(kisses)

654
00:30:58,134 --> 00:31:00,801
(Elisa humming)

655
00:31:08,357 --> 00:31:11,357
(tense piano music)

656
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:19,880
- David, morning.

657
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:20,993
- Morning, Sam.

658
00:31:23,254 --> 00:31:24,780
(clears throat) Where is she?

659
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:25,800
- She's in jail.

660
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:26,930
She got a speeding ticket,

661
00:31:26,930 --> 00:31:29,606
apparently told the officer
he has an authority problem.

662
00:31:29,606 --> 00:31:30,710
(chuckles) Anyway, they arrested her

663
00:31:30,710 --> 00:31:31,960
but she wouldn't let me pay bail.

664
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:33,610
She wants to experience being a prisoner

665
00:31:33,610 --> 00:31:35,496
as a sociological event.

666
00:31:35,496 --> 00:31:37,540
- (stammers) She wants what?

667
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:39,660
- Well, she's been incarcerated before.

668
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:42,700
Jaywalking conflict, picketing
an animal research lab.

669
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:43,620
Of course, she'd say we're all

670
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:45,490
in some type of prison anyway.

671
00:31:45,490 --> 00:31:48,767
She once told me men in
jail are more honest.

672
00:31:48,767 --> 00:31:50,691
(David chuckles)

673
00:31:50,691 --> 00:31:52,240
- (sighs) All right, look,
I need the tower plans.

674
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,340
- Nell's got 'em.

675
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:54,923
She was gonna get copies today.

676
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:58,840
(Sam groans)

677
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:00,478
- I do appreciate your generosity,

678
00:32:00,478 --> 00:32:02,160
but I simply told David I did
not want to be bailed out!

679
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:04,350
- Believe me, the last thing I wanted

680
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:05,927
to do was to bail you out, okay?

681
00:32:05,927 --> 00:32:07,820
But the tower plans happened to be locked

682
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:10,112
in your car, which they won't
open unless you are there.

683
00:32:10,112 --> 00:32:10,945
(siren wails)
- Okay, fine.

684
00:32:10,945 --> 00:32:12,120
They can open the car,
you can have your plans,

685
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:12,953
I'm going for a burger.

686
00:32:12,953 --> 00:32:14,227
- Yeah, well you're gonna have to walk.

687
00:32:14,227 --> 00:32:15,210
- Why would I walk?

688
00:32:15,210 --> 00:32:16,630
- Why would a woman with your brains

689
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:18,580
and your looks wanna spend
the night in a holding cell?

690
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:20,300
- You wouldn't understand
even if I told you!

691
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:23,100
- The reason you're gonna have
to walk is because you have

692
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:26,453
so many unpaid tickets,
they impounded your car!

693
00:32:27,390 --> 00:32:29,020
- Where's your car?

694
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:30,951
- It's right over there,
we just walked past it.

695
00:32:30,951 --> 00:32:31,901
- Can I have a lift?

696
00:32:31,901 --> 00:32:32,984
- Absolutely!

697
00:32:38,578 --> 00:32:42,078
(upbeat percussive music)

698
00:33:07,321 --> 00:33:09,790
- Did I tell you I thought
about you in the slammer?

699
00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:12,490
- Yes, several times, but
why don't you tell me again?

700
00:33:17,116 --> 00:33:22,116
(upbeat percussive music)
(chuckling)

701
00:33:40,047 --> 00:33:42,230
(Zoey sighs)

702
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:44,800
- Look, it's not like I'm
(stammers) joining a cult

703
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,410
or getting tattooed, I--

704
00:33:46,410 --> 00:33:47,910
- I'd rather you get tattooed.

705
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:51,330
- Lots of people go back to school

706
00:33:51,330 --> 00:33:53,590
and graduate, and pursue careers!

707
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:55,548
- But honey, you have two years to go.

708
00:33:55,548 --> 00:33:56,381
(Zoey sighs)

709
00:33:56,381 --> 00:33:58,440
I mean, doesn't Zack want you to graduate?

710
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:59,550
He did!

711
00:33:59,550 --> 00:34:02,270
- Yeah, and he still doesn't
know what he wants to do!

712
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:03,120
- Oh, please.

713
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:06,310
- Look, Dad, if you wanna fire me

714
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:08,850
or have me move out, that's fine.

715
00:34:08,850 --> 00:34:11,020
But I am taking another semester off.

716
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:13,260
I'm going to Europe with
Zack and I will finish school

717
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:14,690
when I come home.
(clattering)

718
00:34:14,690 --> 00:34:18,167
I will be at Zack's.
(heels click)

719
00:34:20,047 --> 00:34:22,419
(door slams)

720
00:34:22,419 --> 00:34:23,252
- I'll get you some more coffee.

721
00:34:23,252 --> 00:34:24,085
- No, don't!
(clatters)

722
00:34:24,085 --> 00:34:25,168
All right, please. (stammers)

723
00:34:25,168 --> 00:34:27,400
Don't wait on me, Elisa, okay?!

724
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,483
- I am not waiting on you.

725
00:34:29,483 --> 00:34:32,420
- (grumbles) I'd just
like to push a button

726
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:34,643
and fast forward our lives.

727
00:34:35,890 --> 00:34:37,893
- And what would you fast forward to?

728
00:34:40,865 --> 00:34:41,698
(birds chirping)
Hm?

729
00:34:41,698 --> 00:34:43,700
I don't know, old age?

730
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:44,587
Together.
- Mm.

731
00:34:46,263 --> 00:34:50,080
- You know, Zoey visiting with
the kids, and her husband.

732
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:52,710
- Mm, who probably will not be Zack.

733
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:55,270
Then again, she could do worse than Zack.

734
00:34:55,270 --> 00:34:57,290
You remember that guy
when she was a freshman?

735
00:34:57,290 --> 00:34:59,403
- Elisa, I'm having an affair.

736
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:07,371
(sighs and stammers) The
first time it ever happened--

737
00:35:07,371 --> 00:35:08,850
- You're what?

738
00:35:08,850 --> 00:35:09,765
- I'm sorry.

739
00:35:09,765 --> 00:35:10,985
- [Elisa] Sam.

740
00:35:10,985 --> 00:35:13,453
- I'm sorry, (stammers) I had to tell you.

741
00:35:14,362 --> 00:35:15,195
I wanna talk about it.

742
00:35:15,195 --> 00:35:16,028
(clattering)
(clanging)

743
00:35:16,028 --> 00:35:18,111
We have to talk about it.

744
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:23,750
- Doctor's office.
(employees chatter)

745
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:25,530
- Didn't expect to see you back so soon.

746
00:35:25,530 --> 00:35:27,910
Believe me, it wasn't my idea.

747
00:35:27,910 --> 00:35:31,680
Do you think anybody still
eats creamed tuna on toast?

748
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:32,860
- Uh-huh, my mother.

749
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:34,423
- Well, my mother drank.

750
00:35:35,290 --> 00:35:36,500
And she cautioned me about doctors.

751
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:38,138
She said they only practice medicine--

752
00:35:38,138 --> 00:35:39,910
- 'Cause they can never get it right.

753
00:35:39,910 --> 00:35:41,410
Hold this.
- Okay.

754
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,640
He'll be in to see you
in just a few minutes.

755
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,983
- What do you wanna bet
he blames it on the lab?

756
00:35:49,018 --> 00:35:50,583
(phone rings)

757
00:35:50,583 --> 00:35:52,677
- Hello?
- Great, I will tell him.

758
00:35:52,677 --> 00:35:55,510
(traffic rumbles)

759
00:36:01,501 --> 00:36:02,730
(heels click)

760
00:36:02,730 --> 00:36:03,563
- Elisa?

761
00:36:07,850 --> 00:36:10,653
I waited for you for an
hour, we lost our start time.

762
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:15,753
Hello, anybody home?

763
00:36:17,490 --> 00:36:18,323
Elisa?

764
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:21,423
What's going on?

765
00:36:22,587 --> 00:36:24,433
- Why are you having an affair, Bess?

766
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:26,553
- Why what?

767
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:29,440
- Why are you putting
your marriage in jeopardy?

768
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:31,173
Why are you sneaking and lying?

769
00:36:34,990 --> 00:36:35,823
- I don't know.

770
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:39,063
Murray doesn't have much
of a sexual appetite.

771
00:36:40,690 --> 00:36:42,380
It's my last chance.

772
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:45,103
- I have to go.
(car rumbles)

773
00:36:55,158 --> 00:36:59,691
(employees chatter)
(knocking)

774
00:36:59,691 --> 00:37:00,740
- Nell.

775
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:02,833
- Sam, I need to finish.

776
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:04,823
- I told Elisa.

777
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:07,608
- You what?

778
00:37:07,608 --> 00:37:09,297
- (stammers) I don't know for
sure what's happening with us

779
00:37:09,297 --> 00:37:11,730
but I know I don't want it to stop and I,

780
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:14,082
I don't wanna lie to anyone about it.

781
00:37:14,082 --> 00:37:15,341
- I don't believe this is happening.

782
00:37:15,341 --> 00:37:16,891
- (laughs) I know how you feel.

783
00:37:18,978 --> 00:37:19,920
(kisses)
(phone rings)

784
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:20,753
Sweetie.

785
00:37:22,210 --> 00:37:24,668
- Um, Sam, there's something
I need to tell you.

786
00:37:24,668 --> 00:37:25,850
- (exhales sharply) I don't care.

787
00:37:25,850 --> 00:37:27,340
All right, (chuckles)
I've thought about this.

788
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:28,500
Whatever it is, I don't care.

789
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:29,770
If you're married, you used to be a nun,

790
00:37:29,770 --> 00:37:31,260
you've had a sex change operation,

791
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:32,380
don't tell me because I don't care.

792
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:34,690
- Sam, I'm sick.

793
00:37:34,690 --> 00:37:36,240
- (scoffs and stammers)
Why, what do you mean?

794
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:37,850
Because you're sleeping
with a married man?

795
00:37:37,850 --> 00:37:39,829
Come on, you're supposed to be
the progressive one in this--

796
00:37:39,829 --> 00:37:40,662
- Sam.

797
00:37:40,662 --> 00:37:43,878
- What, sweetie, what?
(knocking)

798
00:37:43,878 --> 00:37:44,711
Sweetie, what is it?

799
00:37:44,711 --> 00:37:46,070
- Excuse me, Sam.

800
00:37:46,070 --> 00:37:47,040
Mrs. Merser's on the phone.

801
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,899
- I'll call her back!

802
00:37:48,899 --> 00:37:50,910
(somber music)
(employees chatter)

803
00:37:50,910 --> 00:37:53,171
- I went to the doctor and...

804
00:37:53,171 --> 00:37:55,574
- What, what is it?

805
00:37:55,574 --> 00:38:00,574
(speaking distantly)
(music swells)

806
00:38:14,631 --> 00:38:17,298
(water bubbles)

807
00:38:19,243 --> 00:38:20,990
(door thuds)

808
00:38:20,990 --> 00:38:22,094
Elisa!

809
00:38:22,094 --> 00:38:24,664
- No, Dad, it's me.

810
00:38:24,664 --> 00:38:25,497
What's up?

811
00:38:27,162 --> 00:38:29,180
- Hi, I was looking for your mom.

812
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:30,470
- Oh, well didn't she tell you?

813
00:38:30,470 --> 00:38:32,740
Bess had some sort of a
panic attack or something

814
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:35,290
and Mom went to stay with
her for a couple of days.

815
00:38:36,350 --> 00:38:39,590
- Ah, I guess we must've
just missed each other.

816
00:38:39,590 --> 00:38:41,320
- Yeah, well if you ask me, it's the moon.

817
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:42,490
I mean, it's almost full, you know?

818
00:38:42,490 --> 00:38:44,990
Which is always when
people get really weird.

819
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:46,360
And did you see Nell today?

820
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:47,373
She was out there.

821
00:38:48,610 --> 00:38:51,270
- Yeah, well she was, (clears throat)

822
00:38:51,270 --> 00:38:53,510
she's, she's gone to the mountains.

823
00:38:53,510 --> 00:38:55,330
- See, people get weird!

824
00:38:55,330 --> 00:38:57,420
I'm gonna defrost a pizza, you want some?

825
00:38:58,855 --> 00:39:00,938
- No, no, I'm not hungry.

826
00:39:03,210 --> 00:39:05,090
Look, Bess.

827
00:39:05,090 --> 00:39:06,879
Bess, please, (stammers) just tell Elisa,

828
00:39:06,879 --> 00:39:08,890
I just wanna talk to
her, just for a minute.

829
00:39:08,890 --> 00:39:10,123
I wanna see how she is.

830
00:39:12,675 --> 00:39:16,182
(sighs) All right, okay.

831
00:39:16,182 --> 00:39:18,028
Tell her I said goodnight.

832
00:39:18,028 --> 00:39:20,778
(phone clatters)

833
00:39:21,876 --> 00:39:24,876
(melancholy music)

834
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,670
- Sam, we know these things can happen,

835
00:39:43,670 --> 00:39:45,103
you know, we're both adults.

836
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:48,710
(sighs) But I know us, I know,

837
00:39:48,710 --> 00:39:50,260
I know that we can work it out.

838
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:54,230
- I know you've given
this a lot of thought.

839
00:39:54,230 --> 00:39:56,030
- No, Sam, every thought!

840
00:39:56,030 --> 00:39:58,380
Each and every thought
since you first told me.

841
00:40:00,570 --> 00:40:02,670
Now, what we gotta do
is look at our options.

842
00:40:02,670 --> 00:40:04,259
- She's dying.

843
00:40:04,259 --> 00:40:06,720
(melancholy music)

844
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:07,580
- She's what?

845
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:11,190
- She's got some form of leukemia.

846
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:15,451
She's got about three or
four months to live and I,

847
00:40:15,451 --> 00:40:16,703
(exhales)
and I need to be with her.

848
00:40:18,644 --> 00:40:23,644
(exhales)
(melancholy music)

849
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:30,177
- Do you love her, Sam, or
you just feel sorry for her?

850
00:40:35,083 --> 00:40:37,780
(Sam grunts)

851
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:42,303
- Listen, Elisa, (grunts) I don't know if,

852
00:40:44,130 --> 00:40:45,893
if you could forgive me, but--

853
00:40:47,342 --> 00:40:48,976
(sighs)
But when she, when

854
00:40:48,976 --> 00:40:50,460
(clears throat) this is over...

855
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:53,640
I'd love to come back.

856
00:40:55,559 --> 00:40:58,363
I love you, I love our life together.

857
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:05,633
You're my family.
(sobbing softly)

858
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:07,913
- You're my family, Sam.

859
00:41:08,970 --> 00:41:10,387
You're my family.

860
00:41:11,679 --> 00:41:14,596
(thoughtful music)

861
00:41:22,228 --> 00:41:24,981
(doorbell rings)

862
00:41:24,981 --> 00:41:29,731
(knocking)
(clock ticks)

863
00:41:30,810 --> 00:41:35,810
(sobbing softly)
(doorbell rings)

864
00:41:39,747 --> 00:41:41,531
(lock clicks)

865
00:41:41,531 --> 00:41:42,364
- Elisa!

866
00:41:46,056 --> 00:41:48,073
Oh my God, Elisa!
(sighs)

867
00:41:48,073 --> 00:41:49,300
I was ringing the bell.

868
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:50,263
- Well, I had the radio on.

869
00:41:50,263 --> 00:41:51,940
I just, I just turned it off.

870
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:53,550
- Honey, are you all right?

871
00:41:53,550 --> 00:41:54,620
- Yeah, I'm fine.

872
00:41:54,620 --> 00:41:56,190
- Hey, Mom?

873
00:41:56,190 --> 00:41:57,570
Do you think, um, Dad would let me

874
00:41:57,570 --> 00:41:59,220
and Zack borrow the video camera?

875
00:42:01,070 --> 00:42:04,280
- You really have a lot of
nerve, (breathes heavily)

876
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:07,330
announcing your asinine
plan to go off to Europe,

877
00:42:07,330 --> 00:42:09,723
and then you go running off to Zack's!

878
00:42:09,723 --> 00:42:11,167
And what is it that you want?

879
00:42:11,167 --> 00:42:12,221
Just whatever you want
(snaps)

880
00:42:12,221 --> 00:42:14,320
and whenever you want it?!
(snaps)

881
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:15,220
- Mom, I'm sorry.

882
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:17,260
I didn't realize it was such a big deal.

883
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:18,550
- Well, it is a big deal, Zoey,

884
00:42:18,550 --> 00:42:20,880
because I can't figure
out what your father wants

885
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:23,899
or doesn't want, because he's
not living with us anymore.

886
00:42:23,899 --> 00:42:25,780
(Elisa sighs)

887
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:30,482
He's having an affair
with a woman who's dying.

888
00:42:30,482 --> 00:42:31,530
(Elisa laughs bitterly)

889
00:42:31,530 --> 00:42:32,390
- Sweetheart--

890
00:42:32,390 --> 00:42:33,770
- Yeah, Mother, what, what?

891
00:42:33,770 --> 00:42:36,280
I mean, was there a talk show about men

892
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:39,927
who leave their wives for
terminally mistresses?

893
00:42:39,927 --> 00:42:44,833
(laughs and sighs heavily) Oh, God.

894
00:42:46,310 --> 00:42:47,920
I mean, (stammers) what do the women do?

895
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:49,190
You tell me, what do the women do?

896
00:42:49,190 --> 00:42:51,540
Do you think that they,
they beg their husbands not

897
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:53,820
to leave them for someone who's dying?

898
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:55,850
Or do you think that they let them go,

899
00:42:55,850 --> 00:42:58,790
and then take them back
when the other woman

900
00:42:58,790 --> 00:43:01,423
has kicked the bucket? (sobs)

901
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:07,442
Oh, you haven't seen
that show yet, have you?

902
00:43:07,442 --> 00:43:12,442
(sobs)
(hurried footsteps)

903
00:43:16,075 --> 00:43:20,325
(knocking)
(sighs)

904
00:43:21,350 --> 00:43:22,830
- Nell, it's Sam.

905
00:43:22,830 --> 00:43:25,223
Come on, open up. (knocks)

906
00:43:32,069 --> 00:43:34,050
(lock clicks)

907
00:43:34,050 --> 00:43:37,230
Hi, I brought you some flowers.

908
00:43:37,230 --> 00:43:39,000
Look, I found this hanging off the door.

909
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,350
The city is gonna turn
your power off tomorrow.

910
00:43:42,950 --> 00:43:44,840
So, how were the mountains?

911
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:47,063
- Good, good air.

912
00:43:48,570 --> 00:43:49,523
- Can I come in?

913
00:43:51,510 --> 00:43:54,263
- Sam, I'm sorry, I'm
afraid I made a mistake.

914
00:43:56,690 --> 00:43:58,690
I don't want you to destroy your family.

915
00:44:00,940 --> 00:44:02,280
And I don't want what's left of my life

916
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:04,618
to become a maudlin circus for two.

917
00:44:04,618 --> 00:44:07,585
- Now, it's not gonna happen, all right?

918
00:44:07,585 --> 00:44:09,020
(stammers) It's too late, anyway.

919
00:44:09,020 --> 00:44:11,740
I already told Elisa, I packed
my bags, they're in the car,

920
00:44:11,740 --> 00:44:13,973
I mean where--
- My main concern right now

921
00:44:13,973 --> 00:44:16,240
is that tomorrow, they're
coming to turn my power off

922
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:18,390
and I have a refrigerator
packed with food.

923
00:44:20,130 --> 00:44:22,210
I'm sorry, I have things to take care of.

924
00:44:24,847 --> 00:44:27,676
(door thuds)

925
00:44:27,676 --> 00:44:32,676
(thoughtful acoustic music)
(fridge whirs)

926
00:44:47,904 --> 00:44:50,654
(juice splashes)

927
00:44:57,818 --> 00:45:00,151
(Nell sobs)

928
00:45:39,245 --> 00:45:41,828
(alarm buzzes)

929
00:46:05,977 --> 00:46:08,644
(wistful music)

930
00:46:20,793 --> 00:46:23,280
(Nell knocks)

931
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:25,818
(Sam groans)

932
00:46:25,818 --> 00:46:26,770
You're gonna get a ticket.

933
00:46:26,770 --> 00:46:28,010
- Nell, just...

934
00:46:29,970 --> 00:46:33,235
Just tell me that you're
not in love with me.

935
00:46:33,235 --> 00:46:35,783
- I'm not in love with you.

936
00:46:35,783 --> 00:46:37,090
- I don't believe that.

937
00:46:39,550 --> 00:46:42,360
- I am in love with you,
but I have no respect

938
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:45,513
for a man who flagrantly
disregards city ordinances.

939
00:46:46,576 --> 00:46:48,907
(Sam chuckles)

940
00:46:48,907 --> 00:46:51,607
- Hey, hey, hey, wait a minute.

941
00:46:51,607 --> 00:46:53,790
Hold on a second.

942
00:46:53,790 --> 00:46:58,507
These are for you; unfortunately they're--

943
00:46:58,507 --> 00:46:59,757
- They're dead.

944
00:47:02,210 --> 00:47:05,113
Okay, Sam, these are the rules.

945
00:47:06,020 --> 00:47:09,770
We have to say it, whether
it's dear departed,

946
00:47:09,770 --> 00:47:12,446
gone but not forgotten, passed away.

947
00:47:12,446 --> 00:47:14,193
(inhales) Or dead.

948
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:16,560
You have to say it, Sam, hm?

949
00:47:18,580 --> 00:47:23,330
(kisses)
(wistful music)

950
00:47:27,260 --> 00:47:30,390
- He left a number where we
can reach him if we need him.

951
00:47:30,390 --> 00:47:31,470
- How responsible.

952
00:47:31,470 --> 00:47:33,410
- Oh come on, Bess,
what's he supposed to do?

953
00:47:33,410 --> 00:47:34,530
Not leave a number?

954
00:47:34,530 --> 00:47:36,920
- No, what he's supposed
to do is not leave you.

955
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:38,450
- Oh, really?

956
00:47:38,450 --> 00:47:40,520
So according to your
rules, it's okay to cheat.

957
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:42,320
You just have to stay home to do it.

958
00:47:45,910 --> 00:47:48,110
I thought we were etched in stone.

959
00:47:48,110 --> 00:47:48,943
- So did I.

960
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:53,223
- So, the west wing is
our biggest problem.

961
00:47:54,750 --> 00:47:56,970
- No, I think it's, I
think it's the position

962
00:47:56,970 --> 00:47:59,140
of the west wing that's preventing us

963
00:47:59,140 --> 00:48:00,980
from getting the flow we need

964
00:48:00,980 --> 00:48:03,130
from inside to outside recreation.

965
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:04,730
What about the north end?
- Hi!

966
00:48:05,580 --> 00:48:06,563
Sorry I'm late.

967
00:48:08,710 --> 00:48:13,123
Zack and I had an urge to
go to brunch, so we did.

968
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:15,610
Uh, is there anything
I can do for your, Dad?

969
00:48:15,610 --> 00:48:18,020
I mean, any, any whim you need satisfied,

970
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:19,863
or have they all been taken care of?

971
00:48:20,794 --> 00:48:23,294
(phone rings)

972
00:48:24,580 --> 00:48:25,680
- Would you excuse us?

973
00:48:31,530 --> 00:48:33,100
(door thuds)

974
00:48:33,100 --> 00:48:34,013
Would you please like to tell me

975
00:48:34,013 --> 00:48:35,230
what the hell that was all about?

976
00:48:35,230 --> 00:48:36,630
- Oh golly, Dad, I wonder.

977
00:48:36,630 --> 00:48:38,620
Could it be that my skirt
wasn't ready at the cleaners,

978
00:48:38,620 --> 00:48:41,617
or that you walked out on
Mom and me for some bimbo?!

979
00:48:43,060 --> 00:48:44,363
- Nell is not a bimbo.

980
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:49,493
- Nell?

981
00:48:52,270 --> 00:48:53,213
- Nell is dying.

982
00:48:57,800 --> 00:48:59,250
- Does Mom know, who?

983
00:49:00,605 --> 00:49:01,438
(employees chatter)
- Congratulations,

984
00:49:01,438 --> 00:49:03,080
really nice job.
- Thanks.

985
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:05,536
- No, no, I haven't told her yet.

986
00:49:05,536 --> 00:49:07,236
Let's go over here and talk, okay?

987
00:49:13,260 --> 00:49:15,110
Look, Zo, I didn't plan this, all right?

988
00:49:15,110 --> 00:49:17,320
Any more than Nell planned to get sick.

989
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:19,810
I love you, (stammers) I love your mother.

990
00:49:19,810 --> 00:49:22,250
I'm asking myself questions
I don't have answers--

991
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:24,050
- So why does she wanna be with you?

992
00:49:26,657 --> 00:49:29,353
- (scoffs) Listen, Zo.

993
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:36,003
We wanna be with each other,
for whatever time we have left.

994
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:40,350
I know this is an awful
lot to try to understand

995
00:49:40,350 --> 00:49:43,830
but believe me. (stammers)

996
00:49:43,830 --> 00:49:47,713
I'm really trying to do
what I think is right.

997
00:49:50,810 --> 00:49:53,183
- Good, so am I.

998
00:49:54,370 --> 00:49:55,920
Zack and I are getting married.

999
00:49:58,930 --> 00:50:02,063
Oh, don't bother checking
the mail for your invitation.

1000
00:50:05,095 --> 00:50:07,050
(Sam sighs)

1001
00:50:07,050 --> 00:50:08,950
No, I don't get it.

1002
00:50:08,950 --> 00:50:10,620
I mean, if Dad doesn't
give a damn about you

1003
00:50:10,620 --> 00:50:12,520
then why should you give him
the benefit of the doubt?

1004
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:14,683
- Honey, he does give a damn about me.

1005
00:50:15,650 --> 00:50:18,960
He's been my husband for
over half my lifetime.

1006
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:20,510
And in case you have forgotten,

1007
00:50:20,510 --> 00:50:22,750
he is the father of my only child.

1008
00:50:22,750 --> 00:50:25,890
Honey, your father and I have
always shared everything.

1009
00:50:25,890 --> 00:50:28,883
Sometimes, I don't know
where I stop and he begins.

1010
00:50:30,372 --> 00:50:31,205
(sighs)
Zoey,

1011
00:50:31,205 --> 00:50:34,000
have you ever given anybody
the benefit of a doubt?

1012
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,823
- Yes, but I am not a doormat.

1013
00:50:38,010 --> 00:50:39,530
(phone rings)

1014
00:50:39,530 --> 00:50:42,000
- Would you please get that?

1015
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:42,850
- I'd rather not.

1016
00:50:44,064 --> 00:50:46,564
(heels click)

1017
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:48,593
- Hello?

1018
00:50:50,650 --> 00:50:52,053
Oh no, when?

1019
00:50:53,900 --> 00:50:56,384
All right, (stammers) I'll be right there.

1020
00:50:56,384 --> 00:50:57,217
(phone slams)
Oh God,

1021
00:50:57,217 --> 00:50:58,410
that was Dr. Shore from the hospital.

1022
00:50:58,410 --> 00:51:01,210
Grandma's been taken
there with chest pains!

1023
00:51:01,210 --> 00:51:02,580
I, I've gotta get my stuff.

1024
00:51:02,580 --> 00:51:04,530
Will you please call your father, Zoey?

1025
00:51:06,150 --> 00:51:08,450
Honey, I understand how
hard this is but listen,

1026
00:51:08,450 --> 00:51:10,780
we're both going through it. (sighs)

1027
00:51:10,780 --> 00:51:14,160
I'm trying to do the best I
can, I need you to help me.

1028
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:17,100
Please, will you help me, please?

1029
00:51:17,100 --> 00:51:17,933
Come on.

1030
00:51:23,100 --> 00:51:25,433
Hi Murray, it's Elisa, is Bess there?

1031
00:51:26,890 --> 00:51:27,890
(intercom chatters)
She...

1032
00:51:29,060 --> 00:51:32,020
Oh no, no, well she was with me, yeah.

1033
00:51:32,020 --> 00:51:35,983
Um, oh gee, Mur, I don't have
a watch, I don't know when.

1034
00:51:37,220 --> 00:51:38,730
Well she'll be there soon, I'm sure.

1035
00:51:38,730 --> 00:51:41,530
I mean, (stammers) she should
be there any minute, yeah.

1036
00:51:42,730 --> 00:51:44,320
Listen, Sam's here, I've gotta go.

1037
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:46,993
I'll uh, I'll call her,
I'll call her later, huh?

1038
00:51:46,993 --> 00:51:48,250
Just tell her I can't go to work tomorrow.

1039
00:51:48,250 --> 00:51:49,623
I'll, I'll explain later.

1040
00:51:50,651 --> 00:51:51,812
- So, how's Janet?

1041
00:51:51,812 --> 00:51:53,260
- (sighs) In and out of consciousness,

1042
00:51:53,260 --> 00:51:55,344
with a lot of tubes and...

1043
00:51:55,344 --> 00:51:56,177
(Sam sighs)

1044
00:51:56,177 --> 00:51:58,000
She called your name a couple of times.

1045
00:51:58,902 --> 00:52:00,102
- (sighs) How you doin'?

1046
00:52:01,090 --> 00:52:02,040
- I've been better.

1047
00:52:09,990 --> 00:52:12,540
(Elisa sighs)

1048
00:52:12,540 --> 00:52:16,806
So, Bess told Murray that
she was out with me tonight.

1049
00:52:16,806 --> 00:52:18,004
- Hm, was she?
(sighs tensely)

1050
00:52:18,004 --> 00:52:18,837
- No.

1051
00:52:21,057 --> 00:52:23,057
But I have a good idea of where she was.

1052
00:52:27,430 --> 00:52:28,493
- It's Nell Bergen.

1053
00:52:29,540 --> 00:52:31,590
It's the architect that I'm working with.

1054
00:52:32,953 --> 00:52:35,953
(employees chatter)

1055
00:52:37,270 --> 00:52:39,170
- Well, I didn't think it was Phyllis.

1056
00:52:41,941 --> 00:52:44,923
(sighs) You're living in a tent?

1057
00:52:47,889 --> 00:52:48,722
- Ah.

1058
00:52:50,071 --> 00:52:52,433
No, she has a place
downtown, I'm staying there.

1059
00:53:01,730 --> 00:53:02,563
Hi, Zo.

1060
00:53:04,704 --> 00:53:05,537
- Hi.

1061
00:53:07,415 --> 00:53:08,415
- Hi, honey.

1062
00:53:10,215 --> 00:53:11,823
- (clears throat) So, how's Zack?

1063
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:14,473
- Fine.

1064
00:53:17,270 --> 00:53:21,440
Um, Mom, I'm gonna go
back in and sit with Gran.

1065
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:22,280
- Okay, sweetheart.

1066
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:25,383
I'm gonna visit with your,
with your father for a while.

1067
00:53:31,163 --> 00:53:36,163
(siren wails)
(intercom chatters)

1068
00:53:38,403 --> 00:53:40,550
- Want some more coffee?

1069
00:53:40,550 --> 00:53:41,383
- Yeah.

1070
00:53:48,020 --> 00:53:50,720
Maybe after a while, people
just have to switch roles.

1071
00:53:54,618 --> 00:53:57,020
(sighs) After being taken
care of for so long,

1072
00:53:57,020 --> 00:53:59,013
maybe you need to take care of somebody.

1073
00:54:10,048 --> 00:54:13,111
(thoughtful music)

1074
00:54:13,111 --> 00:54:15,528
(door slams)

1075
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:26,153
- David!

1076
00:54:27,497 --> 00:54:29,278
I don't suppose that coffee's for me, huh?

1077
00:54:29,278 --> 00:54:31,383
- 'Fraid not, Nell was too tired to sleep.

1078
00:54:32,570 --> 00:54:33,730
She called a little before three

1079
00:54:33,730 --> 00:54:35,070
and said she thought
it would be a good idea

1080
00:54:35,070 --> 00:54:37,453
if she worked, but she
didn't wanna work alone.

1081
00:54:38,584 --> 00:54:42,537
- Yeah, you're a good friend, David.

1082
00:54:42,537 --> 00:54:44,713
- It's easy, I love her.

1083
00:54:45,860 --> 00:54:47,823
- Yeah, me too.

1084
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:53,610
- David, these plans stink!

1085
00:54:53,610 --> 00:54:55,863
Please don't hurry just because I am sick.

1086
00:55:03,320 --> 00:55:04,520
How's the mother-in-law?

1087
00:55:05,583 --> 00:55:07,890
- Ah, she's out of the woods, thanks.

1088
00:55:07,890 --> 00:55:08,723
- Good.

1089
00:55:09,860 --> 00:55:11,710
Well, at least she's not gonna croak.

1090
00:55:13,116 --> 00:55:14,699
- Nell, you look...

1091
00:55:15,782 --> 00:55:16,770
You look tired.

1092
00:55:16,770 --> 00:55:17,833
- Is that compared to
people in intensive care,

1093
00:55:17,833 --> 00:55:19,713
or just dying people in general?

1094
00:55:21,060 --> 00:55:23,010
- I just remembered something I forgot.

1095
00:55:29,310 --> 00:55:31,940
- They say dying is easy, comedy's hard.

1096
00:55:31,940 --> 00:55:33,630
Boy, are they wrong.

1097
00:55:33,630 --> 00:55:36,060
Can't forget about it for one second!

1098
00:55:36,060 --> 00:55:38,250
It's this horrible
coincidental phenomena crap

1099
00:55:38,250 --> 00:55:40,950
where everywhere you turn,
there's a song on the radio.

1100
00:55:40,950 --> 00:55:42,210
There's a report about death and dying

1101
00:55:42,210 --> 00:55:43,220
on the six o'clock news.

1102
00:55:43,220 --> 00:55:46,110
There are bookstores packed
with books, just about dying!

1103
00:55:46,110 --> 00:55:48,940
There are how-to books,
because they figure no one,

1104
00:55:48,940 --> 00:55:50,940
no one gets beyond the amateur standing.

1105
00:55:53,021 --> 00:55:54,700
- (clears throat) Nell,
why don't you just go home?

1106
00:55:54,700 --> 00:55:56,970
- Because I don't want to go home!

1107
00:55:56,970 --> 00:55:58,780
So I can have some soup and listen

1108
00:55:58,780 --> 00:56:00,270
to a tape of whales giving birth.

1109
00:56:00,270 --> 00:56:02,370
Oh, that would really make me feel better!

1110
00:56:03,510 --> 00:56:05,210
Sam, why don't you leave me alone?

1111
00:56:06,130 --> 00:56:08,120
- Is this about me
seeing Elisa last night?

1112
00:56:08,120 --> 00:56:09,810
- Oh please, Sam!

1113
00:56:09,810 --> 00:56:12,120
This is about work.

1114
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:14,630
I'm behind, and we both
know what that means.

1115
00:56:14,630 --> 00:56:15,880
That there's not much
chance of me bringing

1116
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:18,003
this project to life. (pants)

1117
00:56:18,003 --> 00:56:20,710
But I wanna have a shot at it.

1118
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:22,160
So if you'd just let me work.

1119
00:56:23,438 --> 00:56:25,351
Please let me work.

1120
00:56:25,351 --> 00:56:28,268
(thoughtful music)

1121
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:50,160
- [Janet] What'd I miss?

1122
00:56:51,774 --> 00:56:54,441
(sighs happily)

1123
00:56:56,780 --> 00:57:00,403
- About 18 hours and a mild heart attack,

1124
00:57:03,310 --> 00:57:04,810
but you're gonna be all right.

1125
00:57:06,130 --> 00:57:09,793
No surgery, just a
change in your lifestyle.

1126
00:57:11,850 --> 00:57:14,634
- No more chocolate-chocolate chip?

1127
00:57:14,634 --> 00:57:16,763
- (chuckles) Not after every meal.

1128
00:57:19,340 --> 00:57:20,403
- Heard from Sam?

1129
00:57:21,870 --> 00:57:22,930
(intercom chatters)
- He left a few hours ago.

1130
00:57:22,930 --> 00:57:24,430
He was here most of the night.

1131
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:29,913
(sighs) He's not having an easy time.

1132
00:57:32,270 --> 00:57:33,653
- Neither did your father.

1133
00:57:35,430 --> 00:57:36,263
- Pardon me?

1134
00:57:38,792 --> 00:57:42,110
- Oh, your father loved me,
in a manner of speaking.

1135
00:57:42,110 --> 00:57:45,193
And he most certainly loved you.

1136
00:57:46,860 --> 00:57:51,860
But he also loved a lady
named Claire, with whom he

1137
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:56,483
had a somewhat tortured
relationship just under 20 years.

1138
00:57:57,980 --> 00:57:58,813
- What!

1139
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:05,390
- Claire was married to a prominent judge,

1140
00:58:05,390 --> 00:58:09,623
so she didn't feel she
could get a divorce,

1141
00:58:11,439 --> 00:58:13,533
and I guess your father didn't want one.

1142
00:58:16,573 --> 00:58:17,723
- But you and Dad were always--

1143
00:58:17,723 --> 00:58:20,687
- (groans) Relationships are,

1144
00:58:22,594 --> 00:58:25,303
are just an idea, Elisa.

1145
00:58:27,170 --> 00:58:30,003
Ideas are a function of our imagination.

1146
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:34,820
You imagined your parents
had a good marriage

1147
00:58:36,140 --> 00:58:37,703
and in many ways, we did.

1148
00:58:39,079 --> 00:58:40,080
- How can you say that if--

1149
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:45,080
- Oh, I, I had the opportunity
to travel by myself,

1150
00:58:46,070 --> 00:58:47,813
which as you know, I adore.

1151
00:58:49,664 --> 00:58:54,490
And I, I had relationships...

1152
00:58:55,495 --> 00:58:56,395
with other people,

1153
00:58:57,810 --> 00:58:59,393
which I enjoyed as well.

1154
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:02,980
(Elisa sighs)

1155
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,851
(thoughtful music)

1156
00:59:06,851 --> 00:59:09,684
(papers rustling)

1157
00:59:17,970 --> 00:59:20,150
I can't find the Borowski file!

1158
00:59:20,150 --> 00:59:21,410
Do you have it, Bess?

1159
00:59:21,410 --> 00:59:24,310
- Aha, so there is a correlation

1160
00:59:24,310 --> 00:59:29,130
between sex and organization.
(phone rings)

1161
00:59:29,130 --> 00:59:29,963
Sorry.

1162
00:59:32,610 --> 00:59:34,323
You're gonna get an ulcer, you know?

1163
00:59:35,380 --> 00:59:37,673
Or maybe you'll just go
crazy and kill someone?

1164
00:59:39,153 --> 00:59:40,930
(drawer slams)
- Maybe I'll kill you.

1165
00:59:40,930 --> 00:59:42,600
- Well, at least then
you'll be doing something.

1166
00:59:42,600 --> 00:59:44,620
- I am doing something, Bess.

1167
00:59:44,620 --> 00:59:45,593
- Oh really, what?

1168
00:59:46,910 --> 00:59:48,120
what are you doing?

1169
00:59:48,120 --> 00:59:50,850
You're looking for a file,
you're getting a manicure.

1170
00:59:50,850 --> 00:59:52,740
You're living like your life is normal.

1171
00:59:52,740 --> 00:59:53,760
Like nothing's changed.

1172
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:55,120
- Fine, Bess, fine!

1173
00:59:55,120 --> 00:59:57,770
I know I should do something,
I just don't know what!

1174
00:59:59,270 --> 01:00:02,800
I played by the rules, we were good!

1175
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:06,410
We communicated, we fought,
we played, we had a child.

1176
01:00:06,410 --> 01:00:09,743
I enjoyed buying shoes,
clothes, things Sam liked.

1177
01:00:10,798 --> 01:00:11,870
(sighs) There oughta be instructions

1178
01:00:11,870 --> 01:00:14,090
for this because I don't know what to do.

1179
01:00:14,090 --> 01:00:15,560
- Well, maybe that's
because you don't know

1180
01:00:15,560 --> 01:00:18,270
whether you miss Sam or
the life you had with him.

1181
01:00:18,270 --> 01:00:19,770
Well, there's a difference, you know?

1182
01:00:19,770 --> 01:00:20,737
- Stop it, Bess!

1183
01:00:20,737 --> 01:00:22,360
Do you know what I'm doing?

1184
01:00:22,360 --> 01:00:23,830
I'm waking up every morning

1185
01:00:23,830 --> 01:00:26,200
and I am struggling to get out of bed.

1186
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:28,230
I'm forcing myself to eat a piece of toast

1187
01:00:28,230 --> 01:00:31,020
which nearly gags me, and
then I'm running five miles

1188
01:00:31,020 --> 01:00:32,518
instead of two and a
half because I'm afraid

1189
01:00:32,518 --> 01:00:33,351
if I don't--
- Elisa,

1190
01:00:33,351 --> 01:00:34,360
I didn't mean to upset you like this.

1191
01:00:34,360 --> 01:00:36,560
- Just do me a favor, will you?

1192
01:00:36,560 --> 01:00:40,600
Stop with the ulcer advice
and the dime store psychology.

1193
01:00:40,600 --> 01:00:44,553
And don't you ever, ever use
me to lie to Murray again!

1194
01:00:47,723 --> 01:00:52,306
(sighs)
(slams files)

1195
01:00:56,607 --> 01:00:58,967
(phone rings)
- Mercer Jacobs?

1196
01:00:58,967 --> 01:01:01,967
(employees chatter)

1197
01:01:03,140 --> 01:01:03,973
- Hi, Phyllis.

1198
01:01:05,220 --> 01:01:06,053
- Oh, you can't--

1199
01:01:06,053 --> 01:01:07,303
- I know, he's at the dentist.

1200
01:01:08,350 --> 01:01:10,017
- Phyllis, I'm going to leave--

1201
01:01:12,907 --> 01:01:15,840
(phone rings)

1202
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:16,673
- You're Nell.

1203
01:01:18,120 --> 01:01:18,953
- Yes, I am.

1204
01:01:20,159 --> 01:01:21,509
I didn't expect to see you.

1205
01:01:23,079 --> 01:01:23,912
- No.

1206
01:01:26,107 --> 01:01:27,310
No, please, don't go.

1207
01:01:27,310 --> 01:01:29,003
Please, just close the door.

1208
01:01:34,342 --> 01:01:36,759
(door thuds)

1209
01:01:40,060 --> 01:01:41,823
- I did not ask Sam to be with me.

1210
01:01:43,320 --> 01:01:45,160
- I asked him not to.

1211
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:45,993
- Yeah.

1212
01:01:48,500 --> 01:01:51,220
- You know Zoey quit her job
because she couldn't handle

1213
01:01:51,220 --> 01:01:53,360
being here with you and her father?

1214
01:01:53,360 --> 01:01:54,193
- I know.

1215
01:01:57,830 --> 01:01:59,363
- I thought you'd be younger.

1216
01:02:00,769 --> 01:02:03,436
(Nell chuckles)

1217
01:02:05,910 --> 01:02:09,273
- It's a mess, but it's worse for you.

1218
01:02:12,420 --> 01:02:13,620
Because when I'm gone...

1219
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:18,850
my feelings will be gone too.

1220
01:02:26,280 --> 01:02:27,113
- Nell...

1221
01:02:29,660 --> 01:02:30,493
I'm sorry.

1222
01:02:33,290 --> 01:02:34,390
- Yeah, I'm sorry too.

1223
01:02:36,627 --> 01:02:41,627
(phone rings)
(employees chatter)

1224
01:02:47,100 --> 01:02:49,555
I always preferred salad
at the end of the meal.

1225
01:02:49,555 --> 01:02:50,388
That's they way they do it in Europe.

1226
01:02:50,388 --> 01:02:51,830
- What did you just say?

1227
01:02:51,830 --> 01:02:53,130
- About salad?

1228
01:02:53,130 --> 01:02:53,963
- Before that.

1229
01:02:55,920 --> 01:02:57,170
- About changing my mind?

1230
01:02:58,180 --> 01:02:59,584
Women's prerogative, Sam.

1231
01:02:59,584 --> 01:03:01,184
- (stammers) Cut the crap, Nell.

1232
01:03:02,626 --> 01:03:05,219
Come on, what, what are
you trying to tell me?

1233
01:03:05,219 --> 01:03:07,680
What are you saying?

1234
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:10,080
- Well, this afternoon I
went to see the doctor.

1235
01:03:12,310 --> 01:03:13,950
I thought I was ready to hear some

1236
01:03:13,950 --> 01:03:16,783
of the less subtle
symptoms of this disease.

1237
01:03:18,080 --> 01:03:19,580
As you know, it can be sudden.

1238
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:23,470
It all sounds very grim. (sighs)

1239
01:03:23,470 --> 01:03:25,435
- Look Nell, I told you
that doesn't matter to me.

1240
01:03:25,435 --> 01:03:27,230
- It matters to me.

1241
01:03:30,323 --> 01:03:32,740
I think the longer we're together,

1242
01:03:32,740 --> 01:03:35,650
the more difficult it's gonna
be for you when I'm gone.

1243
01:03:35,650 --> 01:03:36,767
- Hey, now, wait a minute.

1244
01:03:36,767 --> 01:03:39,240
Wait, now that's a decision
that I make, not you.

1245
01:03:39,240 --> 01:03:42,203
- No, the dying person
makes the decisions.

1246
01:03:46,729 --> 01:03:49,062
(Sam sighs)

1247
01:03:50,500 --> 01:03:52,050
Your bags are by the door, Sam.

1248
01:03:55,670 --> 01:03:57,220
- Nell, why are you doing this?

1249
01:04:01,740 --> 01:04:04,550
- When I'm with you, I remember I'm dying.

1250
01:04:04,550 --> 01:04:09,493
I feel like I'm dying!
(car alarm blares distantly)

1251
01:04:10,520 --> 01:04:12,070
There's so much anger and pain.

1252
01:04:15,880 --> 01:04:17,700
We started too late, Sam.

1253
01:04:17,700 --> 01:04:19,900
What I have with you,
I do not want to rush.

1254
01:04:20,980 --> 01:04:22,130
Would you please leave?

1255
01:04:24,190 --> 01:04:27,293
Please leave. (gasps softly)

1256
01:04:49,883 --> 01:04:51,810
- Mom, stop if you want to.

1257
01:04:51,810 --> 01:04:52,963
- I'll stop at the car.

1258
01:04:54,091 --> 01:04:55,370
And then, I'm going for a spin.

1259
01:04:55,370 --> 01:04:57,963
- Oh really, who's driving?

1260
01:04:57,963 --> 01:04:59,530
- I've imposed on you long enough.

1261
01:04:59,530 --> 01:05:00,640
And besides, two weeks at your house

1262
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:02,470
has given me a case of cabin fever.

1263
01:05:02,470 --> 01:05:05,742
- Thank you, it's,
(chuckles) it's been 10 days.

1264
01:05:05,742 --> 01:05:06,740
- Hm.

1265
01:05:06,740 --> 01:05:09,590
- Maybe you'd like to go live
with Sam in his hotel room.

1266
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:11,890
- He's not with her anymore?

1267
01:05:11,890 --> 01:05:12,940
- I'm not sure.

1268
01:05:12,940 --> 01:05:15,040
He's not staying there, that's all I know.

1269
01:05:16,300 --> 01:05:18,310
Well, here's good news!
(brakes screech)

1270
01:05:18,310 --> 01:05:20,300
Your granddaughter's survived
another wilderness weekend

1271
01:05:20,300 --> 01:05:22,743
with Zack.
(laughing)

1272
01:05:25,797 --> 01:05:27,630
- Uh-oh, looks like trouble in paradise.

1273
01:05:27,630 --> 01:05:29,280
- Maybe it's catching.

1274
01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:31,330
Honey, is something wrong?

1275
01:05:31,330 --> 01:05:33,513
- No, Mom, everything's wrong.

1276
01:05:36,685 --> 01:05:37,518
- Oh, boy.

1277
01:05:41,540 --> 01:05:43,523
- Zack says he doesn't wanna have kids.

1278
01:05:46,040 --> 01:05:49,750
He says they're um, little anchors

1279
01:05:50,890 --> 01:05:55,890
and he wants to sail with the wind.

1280
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:57,293
- Oh, sweetie.

1281
01:05:59,030 --> 01:06:01,040
- I'm gonna get some honey.

1282
01:06:01,040 --> 01:06:02,550
Does anyone else want honey?

1283
01:06:02,550 --> 01:06:03,383
- No.

1284
01:06:04,469 --> 01:06:05,373
(sighs) Zack.

1285
01:06:06,360 --> 01:06:07,193
- Mom?

1286
01:06:09,538 --> 01:06:10,988
What happened to the kitchen?

1287
01:06:13,890 --> 01:06:14,953
What'd you do?

1288
01:06:17,150 --> 01:06:18,333
- I think your mother
decided that she wanted--

1289
01:06:18,333 --> 01:06:20,610
- I'm making some changes.

1290
01:06:20,610 --> 01:06:22,233
- Some changes?

1291
01:06:23,180 --> 01:06:24,690
Dad built you that kitchen.

1292
01:06:24,690 --> 01:06:26,910
You said that that was
the perfect kitchen!

1293
01:06:26,910 --> 01:06:29,420
- Dad built the kitchen he wanted.

1294
01:06:29,420 --> 01:06:31,343
Now it's gonna be the kitchen I want.

1295
01:06:32,332 --> 01:06:34,140
Okay?
(scoffs)

1296
01:06:34,140 --> 01:06:36,400
- I don't get anyone anymore.

1297
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:40,943
I mean, you, Zack, Nell, Dad.

1298
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:46,440
I hope you don't have any
deep, dark secrets, Gran.

1299
01:06:46,440 --> 01:06:47,590
I couldn't handle that.

1300
01:06:52,392 --> 01:06:55,775
- Oh, boy. (slurps tea)

1301
01:06:55,775 --> 01:06:59,775
(crowd talking over each other)

1302
01:07:12,759 --> 01:07:13,592
- I don't see no music room.

1303
01:07:13,592 --> 01:07:15,520
I heard there were gonna be lessons.

1304
01:07:15,520 --> 01:07:16,830
- Yeah, you're gonna
sign up right over there,

1305
01:07:16,830 --> 01:07:18,233
behind the childcare, okay?

1306
01:07:19,190 --> 01:07:20,620
- My momma wants me to play the horn.

1307
01:07:20,620 --> 01:07:22,037
I wanna play the drums.

1308
01:07:24,167 --> 01:07:25,467
- Why don't you play both?

1309
01:07:31,263 --> 01:07:32,850
- Good morning, Sam.
(crowd chatting)

1310
01:07:32,850 --> 01:07:34,186
- Good kid.

1311
01:07:34,186 --> 01:07:35,310
So, how's it going?

1312
01:07:35,310 --> 01:07:37,460
- Good, yeah, people feel good.

1313
01:07:37,460 --> 01:07:38,668
Everybody's helping out.

1314
01:07:38,668 --> 01:07:40,410
- Well good, that's the whole idea.

1315
01:07:40,410 --> 01:07:42,900
- Nell's been working too hard, though.

1316
01:07:42,900 --> 01:07:44,370
- Yeah, I haven't seen too much

1317
01:07:44,370 --> 01:07:45,873
of her the last couple of weeks.

1318
01:07:45,873 --> 01:07:47,580
She's been working at home.

1319
01:07:47,580 --> 01:07:50,413
- Now, what was it she said about you?

1320
01:07:50,413 --> 01:07:51,463
- Oh, brother. (chuckles)

1321
01:07:51,463 --> 01:07:53,693
- That you weren't a diamond in the rough,

1322
01:07:55,376 --> 01:07:57,459
but you were the diamond.

1323
01:07:59,290 --> 01:08:01,537
She said you'd been going
through some tough times,

1324
01:08:01,537 --> 01:08:03,587
that somebody close to you was very sick.

1325
01:08:04,460 --> 01:08:05,293
I'm sorry.

1326
01:08:07,870 --> 01:08:08,920
- This is ridiculous.

1327
01:08:10,276 --> 01:08:11,883
I mean, this is ridiculous!

1328
01:08:17,750 --> 01:08:19,550
If you want, I'll stay at the hotel.

1329
01:08:21,228 --> 01:08:22,061
- No.

1330
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:25,893
- No to which part?

1331
01:08:29,030 --> 01:08:30,030
- I guess you're um,

1332
01:08:32,551 --> 01:08:35,251
you're lucky that I'm not
strong enough to resist you.

1333
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:46,037
(thoughtful music)

1334
01:09:00,590 --> 01:09:01,955
Tell me the truth.

1335
01:09:01,955 --> 01:09:02,788
- 'Kay.

1336
01:09:04,290 --> 01:09:05,453
- How do I look?

1337
01:09:09,617 --> 01:09:10,450
- Loved.

1338
01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:22,780
- Okay.
- Okay, now,

1339
01:09:22,780 --> 01:09:24,499
that back splash needs to be light.

1340
01:09:24,499 --> 01:09:25,660
- [Elisa] Right.

1341
01:09:25,660 --> 01:09:28,720
- The 20 years I've been
contracting, people use this.

1342
01:09:28,720 --> 01:09:30,765
Kinda reminds me of an Italian restaurant.

1343
01:09:30,765 --> 01:09:32,371
(laughing)
- Yeah.

1344
01:09:32,371 --> 01:09:34,953
I really, I wanna stick
with these, these are great.

1345
01:09:34,953 --> 01:09:35,786
- Okay.
- Don't you think?

1346
01:09:35,786 --> 01:09:37,510
- Those are nice, yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

1347
01:09:37,510 --> 01:09:38,820
- You might wanna run it
by your husband though,

1348
01:09:38,820 --> 01:09:41,240
'cause couples sometimes get into things

1349
01:09:41,240 --> 01:09:42,210
over this stuff. (chuckles)

1350
01:09:42,210 --> 01:09:44,937
- Mm-hmm, yeah, well I'm separated, so.

1351
01:09:46,580 --> 01:09:47,413
- Oh.

1352
01:09:48,323 --> 01:09:49,460
(door thuds)
- Elisa!

1353
01:09:49,460 --> 01:09:50,330
- Mom!

1354
01:09:50,330 --> 01:09:53,459
Oh Mom, this is my contractor
in here, Richard Pra, uh,

1355
01:09:53,459 --> 01:09:54,292
(stammers) Prinder?

1356
01:09:54,292 --> 01:09:55,125
- Pender.
- Pender, Pender.

1357
01:09:55,125 --> 01:09:55,958
My mother.
- Nice to meet you.

1358
01:09:55,958 --> 01:09:58,160
- Janet Catherine.
- Nice to meet you. (laughs)

1359
01:09:58,160 --> 01:09:59,760
- Why don't I run out and
get those wood samples.

1360
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:00,593
- Great.

1361
01:10:04,320 --> 01:10:06,310
- Well, it's nice to
have an attractive man

1362
01:10:06,310 --> 01:10:07,160
around the house.

1363
01:10:08,550 --> 01:10:11,390
- I think they gave you too
much oxygen at the hospital.

1364
01:10:11,390 --> 01:10:12,223
- You do?

1365
01:10:13,543 --> 01:10:16,363
I don't.
(birds chirping)

1366
01:10:17,221 --> 01:10:18,900
(papers rustling)
(phone rings)

1367
01:10:18,900 --> 01:10:20,540
- Anyway, the doctors say
she'll have some good days

1368
01:10:20,540 --> 01:10:23,840
but you know, the whole
thing can change overnight.

1369
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:24,700
From now on, it's all a matter

1370
01:10:24,700 --> 01:10:26,350
of how she feels from day to day.

1371
01:10:27,210 --> 01:10:29,760
- When I ask her how she
feels, she just says fine.

1372
01:10:30,730 --> 01:10:34,280
She used to tell me the truth,
now she just says "fine."

1373
01:10:34,280 --> 01:10:35,113
- Yeah.

1374
01:10:37,344 --> 01:10:39,670
(Zoey knocking)

1375
01:10:39,670 --> 01:10:40,503
Hey!

1376
01:10:40,503 --> 01:10:43,330
- Hi, can I talk to you for a minute?

1377
01:10:43,330 --> 01:10:44,163
- Sure.

1378
01:10:45,080 --> 01:10:47,083
Do me a favor, would you call Nell?

1379
01:10:47,083 --> 01:10:48,090
Tell her I'll be a few minutes late

1380
01:10:48,090 --> 01:10:50,150
and ask her if there's anything
else she needs, all right?

1381
01:10:50,150 --> 01:10:50,983
- You got it.

1382
01:11:10,370 --> 01:11:11,560
- What I wanna know...

1383
01:11:14,430 --> 01:11:17,130
is how come you still have
Mom's picture on your desk?

1384
01:11:19,640 --> 01:11:23,563
- Because she's my
wife, and I, I love her.

1385
01:11:25,580 --> 01:11:28,810
- Right, I...

1386
01:11:30,566 --> 01:11:32,130
(inhales) I don't get it.

1387
01:11:32,130 --> 01:11:34,727
- Oh (sighs) Zoey, I'm
not sure I do either.

1388
01:11:36,703 --> 01:11:38,823
Relationships are never airtight.

1389
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:40,933
They, they have,

1390
01:11:43,050 --> 01:11:44,173
empty spaces.

1391
01:11:46,640 --> 01:11:48,577
And when things are mostly good,

1392
01:11:48,577 --> 01:11:51,400
well you, you just
don't notice the spaces,

1393
01:11:51,400 --> 01:11:52,963
but then something happens.

1394
01:11:56,430 --> 01:12:01,430
And someone comes along and
she fills up those spaces.

1395
01:12:03,081 --> 01:12:05,970
(stammers) She makes you realize

1396
01:12:05,970 --> 01:12:09,543
that they were there in
the first place and how,

1397
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:16,760
how wonderful it feels not
to have them empty anymore.

1398
01:12:27,086 --> 01:12:28,736
(sighs) So what about your plans?

1399
01:12:30,540 --> 01:12:31,380
- Oh, um...

1400
01:12:33,180 --> 01:12:35,280
Well, (stammers) we postponed the wedding.

1401
01:12:36,360 --> 01:12:41,360
Um, Zack and I are reviewing
some things and besides,

1402
01:12:42,700 --> 01:12:46,563
the original date didn't
work with um, Mom's new job.

1403
01:12:48,910 --> 01:12:49,743
- Your mom has a job?

1404
01:12:49,743 --> 01:12:52,500
- Oh yeah, the one they always
wanted her for at the museum.

1405
01:12:58,532 --> 01:13:02,111
You should see what she's
done to the kitchen.

1406
01:13:02,111 --> 01:13:02,973
And the backyard.

1407
01:13:07,321 --> 01:13:09,654
(bird caws)

1408
01:13:11,565 --> 01:13:14,573
(dog barks)

1409
01:13:14,573 --> 01:13:15,934
(Elisa gasps)

1410
01:13:15,934 --> 01:13:18,833
- (sighs) You scared me!

1411
01:13:18,833 --> 01:13:20,410
- I'm sorry.

1412
01:13:20,410 --> 01:13:22,390
What are you doing, Elisa?

1413
01:13:22,390 --> 01:13:24,540
- I'm having a new
sprinkler system put in.

1414
01:13:26,060 --> 01:13:27,110
- That's a good idea.

1415
01:13:28,040 --> 01:13:29,190
- I'm glad you approve.

1416
01:13:30,350 --> 01:13:33,073
- So, Zoey said that
you'd taken a new job.

1417
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:34,833
- Yes, I did.

1418
01:13:37,606 --> 01:13:39,303
- You know, you don't need to do that.

1419
01:13:41,770 --> 01:13:42,603
Elisa?

1420
01:13:51,231 --> 01:13:52,931
(door thuds)
- You want some tea?

1421
01:13:53,830 --> 01:13:55,873
- Yeah, herbal if you have it.

1422
01:14:01,107 --> 01:14:04,943
Elisa, (scoffs) I thought
you loved this kitchen.

1423
01:14:06,370 --> 01:14:10,560
- Yeah, I thought so too, huh.

1424
01:14:10,560 --> 01:14:12,070
You know, after we were married,

1425
01:14:12,070 --> 01:14:15,030
I felt so fulfilled and happy, you know?

1426
01:14:15,030 --> 01:14:17,390
And then we had Zoey, and
I even felt more fulfilled,

1427
01:14:17,390 --> 01:14:19,090
which I didn't think was possible.

1428
01:14:20,160 --> 01:14:22,810
I didn't give a lot of
thought to what else I wanted.

1429
01:14:25,890 --> 01:14:28,053
Did you know my father had a mistress?

1430
01:14:30,924 --> 01:14:32,286
- No.

1431
01:14:32,286 --> 01:14:34,869
(Elisa scoffs)

1432
01:14:37,180 --> 01:14:39,263
- You know, you really
scared me out there.

1433
01:14:40,759 --> 01:14:41,700
- I'm sorry, I didn't mean to.

1434
01:14:41,700 --> 01:14:43,400
- I think I'd like your house key.

1435
01:14:46,708 --> 01:14:49,875
(dog barks distantly)

1436
01:14:52,528 --> 01:14:57,528
(kids screaming)
(whimsical music)

1437
01:14:58,530 --> 01:15:01,011
- Sweetie, it's an awful night.

1438
01:15:01,011 --> 01:15:01,844
Why don't we just go home?

1439
01:15:01,844 --> 01:15:03,763
- (sighs) No, Sam, I love the rain.

1440
01:15:06,920 --> 01:15:09,150
You think people can tell?

1441
01:15:09,150 --> 01:15:10,527
- About your being sick?

1442
01:15:10,527 --> 01:15:12,333
- No, about how much I love you.

1443
01:15:16,464 --> 01:15:20,520
- Would you mind if I asked
you a very personal question?

1444
01:15:20,520 --> 01:15:21,353
- Sure.

1445
01:15:22,770 --> 01:15:23,820
- Would you marry me?

1446
01:15:25,064 --> 01:15:28,481
(thoughtful piano music)

1447
01:15:31,025 --> 01:15:31,858
Hm?

1448
01:15:32,980 --> 01:15:35,217
- If I live long enough
to write my memoirs...

1449
01:15:38,710 --> 01:15:40,660
this night will definitely be in there.

1450
01:15:42,480 --> 01:15:43,573
A man proposed.

1451
01:15:46,200 --> 01:15:48,417
I said, "No."

1452
01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:52,580
That I needed to throw up.

1453
01:15:54,720 --> 01:15:56,772
I saw a restroom somewhere up here.

1454
01:15:56,772 --> 01:15:58,555
- Come on, come on.

1455
01:15:58,555 --> 01:16:01,472
(thoughtful music)

1456
01:16:08,306 --> 01:16:12,560
- Maybe we should tell the
doctor about our sex therapy.

1457
01:16:12,560 --> 01:16:14,665
'Course, he might think
that you were a pervert.

1458
01:16:14,665 --> 01:16:17,037
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, I love you too.

1459
01:16:18,657 --> 01:16:21,257
- And he couldn't possibly
imagine so much pleasure.

1460
01:16:26,187 --> 01:16:28,770
(rain patters)

1461
01:16:48,528 --> 01:16:49,372
- Woo!

1462
01:16:49,372 --> 01:16:50,851
I'm back.
(door slams)

1463
01:16:50,851 --> 01:16:52,923
It's showtime, comedy night!

1464
01:16:53,800 --> 01:16:57,377
I got "Spaceballs," I got "Naked Gun."

1465
01:16:58,400 --> 01:17:00,020
I got "The Twelve Chairs,"
I betcha there's--

1466
01:17:00,020 --> 01:17:00,853
- Sam.

1467
01:17:02,180 --> 01:17:03,380
The doctor's on his way.

1468
01:17:06,645 --> 01:17:08,663
(bag thuds)

1469
01:17:08,663 --> 01:17:10,746
- I was gone for an hour.

1470
01:17:13,579 --> 01:17:16,662
(Nell groans weakly)

1471
01:17:25,807 --> 01:17:26,930
(Sam murmurs)

1472
01:17:26,930 --> 01:17:27,763
- Thank God.

1473
01:17:29,210 --> 01:17:30,113
- Listen to me.

1474
01:17:32,810 --> 01:17:36,090
See, see, the only problem
at the carnival was

1475
01:17:36,090 --> 01:17:38,667
that I wasn't prepared.

1476
01:17:38,667 --> 01:17:40,167
- Prepared?
- Yeah.

1477
01:17:43,514 --> 01:17:46,279
(wistful music)

1478
01:17:46,279 --> 01:17:50,862
Nell Bergen, would you do me
the very great honor of...

1479
01:17:54,847 --> 01:17:59,729
becoming my wife?
(rain patters)

1480
01:17:59,729 --> 01:18:02,979
(Nell breathes weakly)

1481
01:18:03,977 --> 01:18:06,265
- Can I tell you a secret?

1482
01:18:06,265 --> 01:18:07,098
- Sure.

1483
01:18:09,457 --> 01:18:11,290
- When I was little...

1484
01:18:13,729 --> 01:18:16,979
people asked me, what did I want to be?

1485
01:18:22,599 --> 01:18:24,373
I said, "Engaged.

1486
01:18:27,844 --> 01:18:30,261
Never married, just engaged."

1487
01:18:31,751 --> 01:18:34,168
(Sam sniffs)

1488
01:18:35,653 --> 01:18:38,205
(Sam chuckles)

1489
01:18:38,205 --> 01:18:42,308
Sam, I don't know what it was between us.

1490
01:18:42,308 --> 01:18:47,308
- Is, hon, what it is. (kisses)

1491
01:18:49,350 --> 01:18:52,260
- Sometimes, people just fit.

1492
01:18:52,260 --> 01:18:55,177
(melancholy music)

1493
01:19:00,804 --> 01:19:01,637
Sam...

1494
01:19:06,832 --> 01:19:09,082
I want you to let go of me.

1495
01:19:11,796 --> 01:19:13,273
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no. (whispers)

1496
01:19:13,273 --> 01:19:14,900
Just rest, the doctor's on his way.

1497
01:19:14,900 --> 01:19:16,650
- I'm not engaged to the doctor.

1498
01:19:22,239 --> 01:19:24,527
I need you to let go.

1499
01:19:24,527 --> 01:19:26,860
- [Sam] No, no, not yet, no.

1500
01:19:27,823 --> 01:19:29,957
Not yet, please, not yet.

1501
01:19:29,957 --> 01:19:32,624
I, I, I want, I want more, Nell.

1502
01:19:34,557 --> 01:19:37,018
Nell, please, please.

1503
01:19:37,018 --> 01:19:39,503
(Nell breathes weakly)

1504
01:19:39,503 --> 01:19:40,420
Nell, Nell?

1505
01:19:41,567 --> 01:19:43,734
Nell, come on, Nell, Nell.

1506
01:19:46,445 --> 01:19:48,124
(music swells)
(stammering)

1507
01:19:48,124 --> 01:19:49,624
I need more, Nell.

1508
01:19:51,526 --> 01:19:54,026
(sobs softly)

1509
01:20:15,547 --> 01:20:18,464
(melancholy music)

1510
01:20:46,370 --> 01:20:48,870
(phone rings)

1511
01:20:50,136 --> 01:20:51,620
(Zoey knocking)

1512
01:20:51,620 --> 01:20:52,453
- Yeah?

1513
01:20:54,794 --> 01:20:55,979
- Got a minute?

1514
01:20:55,979 --> 01:20:56,812
- Hey. (chuckles)

1515
01:20:56,812 --> 01:20:58,093
For you, I got more than that.

1516
01:21:00,778 --> 01:21:02,133
So, what's up?

1517
01:21:03,610 --> 01:21:05,063
- I'm going to Europe.

1518
01:21:05,987 --> 01:21:07,973
- (laughs) Didn't I know this already?

1519
01:21:09,610 --> 01:21:11,400
- Not with Zack.

1520
01:21:11,400 --> 01:21:12,630
- Oh.

1521
01:21:12,630 --> 01:21:13,830
- With my friend, Lydia.

1522
01:21:15,060 --> 01:21:15,893
- Ah.

1523
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:21,940
- The relationship thing is weird.

1524
01:21:21,940 --> 01:21:22,890
- Tell me about it.

1525
01:21:23,740 --> 01:21:25,820
- Um, Dad.

1526
01:21:25,820 --> 01:21:26,653
- Yeah?

1527
01:21:27,900 --> 01:21:29,450
- I wanted you to know...

1528
01:21:31,520 --> 01:21:32,770
I would have invited you

1529
01:21:34,110 --> 01:21:36,327
to the wedding if there had been one.

1530
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:39,300
I would have invited you and Nell.

1531
01:21:41,387 --> 01:21:44,575
- Oh sweetie, thanks.

1532
01:21:44,575 --> 01:21:46,275
(stammers) That means a lot to me.

1533
01:21:53,038 --> 01:21:54,020
- I'm sorry.

1534
01:21:54,020 --> 01:21:54,853
- [Sam] I know.

1535
01:21:56,490 --> 01:21:57,480
- She was...

1536
01:22:00,514 --> 01:22:02,483
- (chuckles) Yeah, yeah, she was.

1537
01:22:03,471 --> 01:22:06,388
(thoughtful music)

1538
01:22:33,684 --> 01:22:36,851
(dog barks distantly)

1539
01:22:42,508 --> 01:22:43,822
(doorbell rings)

1540
01:22:43,822 --> 01:22:45,540
- Hey, you're early!

1541
01:22:45,540 --> 01:22:48,590
Come on in, make yourself a drink.

1542
01:22:48,590 --> 01:22:49,493
- Mom!

1543
01:22:50,590 --> 01:22:52,370
It's--
- Hi, sweetie.

1544
01:22:52,370 --> 01:22:53,273
- Dad, hi.

1545
01:22:54,992 --> 01:22:56,159
- [Sam] Hello.

1546
01:22:57,656 --> 01:23:00,156
(Elisa sighs)

1547
01:23:01,234 --> 01:23:03,400
- You were expecting Bill Clinton.

1548
01:23:03,400 --> 01:23:05,490
- Uh, (chuckles)

1549
01:23:05,490 --> 01:23:06,500
honey, would you excuse us?

1550
01:23:06,500 --> 01:23:07,960
- Yeah.

1551
01:23:07,960 --> 01:23:10,263
- Well, that's, that's quite an outfit.

1552
01:23:11,583 --> 01:23:13,010
(stammers) You said to drop by--

1553
01:23:13,010 --> 01:23:15,100
- Tomorrow, I said tomorrow.

1554
01:23:15,100 --> 01:23:17,210
- I think it's tonight.
- A lot's been going on.

1555
01:23:17,210 --> 01:23:19,060
I'm sorry, I'm busy, I just didn't...

1556
01:23:20,070 --> 01:23:22,520
But I have a little time,
you wanna talk in here?

1557
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:28,727
- [Sam] Bess and Murray comin' over?

1558
01:23:28,727 --> 01:23:30,229
- Bess and Murray, you didn't know?

1559
01:23:30,229 --> 01:23:31,729
They're separated.

1560
01:23:32,857 --> 01:23:34,605
- Gee, I didn't know that.

1561
01:23:34,605 --> 01:23:36,580
I'm sorry. (sighs)

1562
01:23:36,580 --> 01:23:37,413
- Uh...

1563
01:23:38,370 --> 01:23:41,403
Look Sam, you know, when we
first talked about all of this,

1564
01:23:42,950 --> 01:23:46,073
about your coming back, you know, when,

1565
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:51,063
when time passed, I thought it was fine.

1566
01:23:52,240 --> 01:23:57,240
I really did, but then, now
time has come and I, (chuckles)

1567
01:23:59,853 --> 01:24:01,353
I don't think it's gonna work.

1568
01:24:04,232 --> 01:24:06,813
- (scoffs) Well, (stammers)

1569
01:24:06,813 --> 01:24:07,920
maybe it's just too soon.

1570
01:24:07,920 --> 01:24:09,743
- No, it isn't too soon, Sam.

1571
01:24:12,433 --> 01:24:14,722
(sighs) This is very hard, isn't it?

1572
01:24:14,722 --> 01:24:16,560
- (sighs heavily) Well, it depends.

1573
01:24:16,560 --> 01:24:18,310
- I've given this a lot of thought.

1574
01:24:19,750 --> 01:24:21,050
We were like a piece of fabric,

1575
01:24:21,050 --> 01:24:22,743
you know, we were woven together.

1576
01:24:23,910 --> 01:24:26,753
We were perfect, and then
this thing happened, you know?

1577
01:24:28,910 --> 01:24:30,640
And you tore it apart.

1578
01:24:30,640 --> 01:24:33,367
- Come on now, Elisa,
look, we can, we can,

1579
01:24:33,367 --> 01:24:34,993
(sighs) we can fix this thing.

1580
01:24:35,980 --> 01:24:38,570
I'm not stupid, I know
it's not gonna be easy.

1581
01:24:38,570 --> 01:24:41,933
- Sometimes a tear is so
bad, Sam, it can't be fixed.

1582
01:24:44,760 --> 01:24:47,033
- Which means what?
(sighs)

1583
01:24:48,060 --> 01:24:49,510
- We've had a wonderful life.

1584
01:24:51,300 --> 01:24:52,650
We've got a great daughter.

1585
01:24:54,350 --> 01:24:56,433
But no matter how much I try,

1586
01:24:58,066 --> 01:25:00,223
(scoffs) I'm sorry.

1587
01:25:02,770 --> 01:25:03,603
It's over.

1588
01:25:11,070 --> 01:25:13,000
I'm sure we could talk
about this, but you know,

1589
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:15,993
it's getting late and I, I've got plans.

1590
01:25:17,838 --> 01:25:19,653
It would be awkward if you were here.

1591
01:25:51,060 --> 01:25:53,477
(door thuds)

1592
01:25:56,605 --> 01:25:59,022
(calm music)

1593
01:26:09,270 --> 01:26:11,437
- Excuse me, but what's the name of that,

1594
01:26:11,437 --> 01:26:13,380
in the little dish?

1595
01:26:13,380 --> 01:26:16,893
- [Sam] Uh, it's marinated
spinach with bonito flake.

1596
01:26:19,507 --> 01:26:21,707
It's very good, why don't you try it?

1597
01:26:21,707 --> 01:26:24,059
Go ahead, please, you'll enjoy it.

1598
01:26:24,059 --> 01:26:26,429
- (chuckles) Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

1599
01:26:26,429 --> 01:26:29,096
(wistful music)

1600
01:26:44,277 --> 01:26:47,944
(thoughtful acoustic music)

1601
01:27:12,431 --> 01:27:15,598
(bright string music)

1602
01:27:51,199 --> 01:27:53,866
(ambient music)
