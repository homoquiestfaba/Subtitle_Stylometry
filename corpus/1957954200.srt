1
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:10,480
I'm alone, as agreed.

2
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,540
And the money?

3
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:25,880
It's all here.

4
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:39,180
Your theft has caused something
of an international incident.

5
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:41,816
The Japanese government
is blaming the British.

6
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,500
Good.

7
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:48,256
And of course you have your own
personal deal with our Japanese friend.

8
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,980
The hell with him.

9
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:54,000
I believe in rewarding the
highest bidder, Mr. King.

10
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:59,560
Any problem in customs?

11
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:15,400
They never better than I.

12
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,480
So beautiful.

13
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:31,880
No wonder people have killed for it.

14
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:36,480
Don't mind, I'm in a bit of a hurry.

15
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,620
Move and you're a dead man.

16
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:50,960
Lay it flat.

17
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,880
A knife.

18
00:05:56,760 --> 00:06:00,120
You're going to clean some fish.

19
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,880
You could have handle that better.

20
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,320
Get my money.

21
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,320
Get it.

22
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:34,080
- Hurry.
- Filthy.

23
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:40,560
Okay Doe, let's see you got change for 20?

24
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,040
You don't change for 20.

25
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:49,280
Come on lady.

26
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,496
We'Re close.

27
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,540
I just need a second.

28
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:26,300
I've just arrived in town and I'm
here to make you a lot of money.

29
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:31,440
I'm a photographer and I have
worked all over the country.

30
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,216
I don't think we're going to.

31
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,376
I can easily clear 500 night
that is at the place of crowded

32
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,336
which looks like a pretty
happening place to me.

33
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,936
Your 25% of five isn't really that bad.

34
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,756
I don't think it's going
to really work out.

35
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:44,200
- 35.
- We're not really interested.

36
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:46,160
Ok, 50.
Come on, it's not a girl's got.

37
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:47,556
To make a living.

38
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:49,560
Lady. We're not interested.
Nowhere closed.

39
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:52,200
Sebastian.

40
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:01,520
Do you work here?
I could really use some help.

41
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,620
Cameron King.

42
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:08,200
Catherine, Tracy,

43
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:15,100
Katie to everyone of my third
grade teacher and me.

44
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:18,296
Catherine's a beautiful name.

45
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,980
Tourists really like those.

46
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:23,880
So what do you think?

47
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:32,500
Well, I think we could use
another pretty face around here.

48
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:34,860
Why don't you come back
in a couple of hours?

49
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:37,520
- We'll be open.
- Great.

50
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,840
You guys have changed parts.

51
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,580
Near the back door.

52
00:09:44,804 --> 00:09:46,004
Down there.

53
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,280
What are you doing?

54
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,000
She's just what we need.

55
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:37,416
Joe, there you are.

56
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,100
Aren't you going to congratulate me?

57
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:40,460
I just got a job.

58
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:44,440
My day is made. Where's my money?

59
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:49,800
Give me cheap places for money.

60
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,660
Are you sure about your information?

61
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:12,770
Yes.

62
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:16,540
My source is very close to King
and the casinos.

63
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:19,540
On the third floor, the entire
third floor is a secret club.

64
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:22,180
Casino girls, private rooms.

65
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:24,020
Where's the entrance?

66
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:26,016
Behind that door there's an elevator.

67
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,980
Goes from the ground to the second floor.

68
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:30,736
Casino guests are given
special poker chips.

69
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,760
Show a chip and suddenly
there's a third floor.

70
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:34,020
Exactly.

71
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:35,660
Can we get a chip?

72
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:37,020
No way.

73
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:39,410
King hands them out himself.

74
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:44,440
Well, then we'll start by getting
into the nightclub, tomorrow night

75
00:11:44,464 --> 00:11:46,464
and we're something stylish.

76
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:04,220
You do don't have change for 20?

77
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:06,720
I'll be right back.

78
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,136
Hi. Do you change for 20?

79
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,620
No, it's okay, really.
I worked here.

80
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:16,500
Yeah, right. Back of the line.

81
00:12:16,530 --> 00:12:18,580
- No, I really do.
- Back at the line.

82
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:20,856
Look, I'm a photographer.
I spoke with Mr.

83
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,380
King just this afternoon
and he hired me on a spot.

84
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:25,170
Can you believe it?

85
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,836
I don't think it's of my talent.
I think the guy like me.

86
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:29,536
Although it kind of always happens to me.

87
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,966
My mother used to always tell me,
look, kind people like you.

88
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:34,080
There's no reason not
to take advantage of it.

89
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:36,540
You have this huge gift
and you should use it.

90
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:38,460
All right, you can go in.

91
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:40,340
Just please shut up.

92
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:42,840
Take her in.

93
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,220
Can I sit up here?

94
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:50,960
Sure.

95
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:56,500
- First night?
- Yes.

96
00:13:56,530 --> 00:14:00,520
Can I have anything without an umbrella?
Turn it on.

97
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:02,520
The job, huh?

98
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:04,480
All right.

99
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:07,800
Do a club soda with an olive wave.

100
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,180
You're really cute.
What's your name?

101
00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:15,696
Catherine. Katie.

102
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,136
To anybody I like.

103
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,336
Yeah.

104
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:21,640
So what do I call you?

105
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,376
Well, we'll see. And you?

106
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,540
What's your name?

107
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:26,660
Spencer.

108
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:28,060
Or Spence.

109
00:14:28,090 --> 00:14:30,540
To anyone who likes me.

110
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:34,320
Well, see around, Spencer.

111
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,696
Great crowd. What's that?

112
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:42,080
I said, great crowd.

113
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,300
We're not interested, Manhurt.

114
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:47,560
Don't be rude, Leonard.

115
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:48,980
Don't be so rude.

116
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:50,810
We're still not interested.

117
00:14:51,034 --> 00:14:53,234
Come on, Leonard. You don't
have to...

118
00:14:53,258 --> 00:14:55,258
You don't have to take it.

119
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,456
Stay quiet and lay flat.

120
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:25,800
You'll be fine.

121
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:03,800
Can you keep a secret?

122
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:11,520
I hope so, because I
have a wonderful secret.

123
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:18,016
I'm going to let you look,

124
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:22,120
but you have to promise
me not to tell anybody.

125
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:25,300
What do you want?

126
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:27,880
Your expertise.

127
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,336
I want you to examine it again.

128
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:21,480
I want you to be absolutely sure.

129
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,360
I'm sure.

130
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,200
Thank you.

131
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:57,920
You are fortunate to have
done such rap beauty.

132
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,520
God.

133
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,200
Straight up.

134
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,466
Mr. King. Have some time
tonight. I'd like to meet with him.

135
00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:32,096
- What for?
- Have a proposition for me.

136
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:36,080
What kind of a proposition?

137
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:40,900
Well, I'd really like to share it with
you, but I'd rather tell him directly.

138
00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:42,576
Look, he's a busy man.

139
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,160
Anything you tell him comes to me.

140
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:46,160
Anyway, don't worry about it.

141
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:47,900
I'll flag him down later.

142
00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:49,976
Do and it'll be your job.

143
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,640
You go through me.

144
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,940
So how are you doing this evening?

145
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:13,700
Nothing for me.

146
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:16,260
He's a little deaf.

147
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:19,800
So would you guys come here a lot?

148
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,060
No, thank you.

149
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:24,040
Nothing for me either.

150
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:31,700
What about her?

151
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:33,300
Who is she?

152
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:34,700
Takes photographs.

153
00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:36,360
Customers.

154
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,660
Selfish tacky keychain.

155
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:41,976
Now, how could she help the case?

156
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,960
Evidence for warrant
photographs could do the trick.

157
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:53,360
The pearls. Rightfully mine.

158
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:56,560
I arranged its acquisition.

159
00:19:56,590 --> 00:20:00,780
Or perhaps you should have
been more generous with Kern.

160
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:10,000
A million dollars is a pretty good profit.
Due to mr.

161
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:12,600
Kern's, unfortunately, is drowning.

162
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:15,980
The profit is all for you.

163
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:20,440
The pearl is going to be auctioned
off to the highest bidder.

164
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:24,120
I'm here to invite you
to that auction, nothing more.

165
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:26,960
This is an artifact of my people.

166
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:30,740
It is rightfully mine.

167
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:35,880
- 4 million.
- What?

168
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:39,040
4 million will get you a private auction.

169
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:42,260
That is absurd.

170
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:03,740
Let's see with the auction.

171
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:32,320
Lieutenant Victor Martinez.

172
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:35,076
- Detective George Williams, Spy Squad.
- Yes.

173
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:36,760
You work at one Lombard.

174
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:39,160
- Yeah.
- Seems there's been some complaints.

175
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:42,320
Someone working there hasn't
been paying their cab fares.

176
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:45,840
Oh, you're nervous.

177
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:49,580
I thought you were my man, George.

178
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:04,080
On these walls.

179
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:05,740
Yeah.

180
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:12,480
We could forget this
whole cavity complaint.

181
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:14,000
Or a little help from you.

182
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:18,300
Can you take your corner and just
put it like, over there?

183
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:20,790
We have an inside source that tells us

184
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:23,670
that there is illegal gambling
going on the third floor.

185
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:25,790
I didn't know there was a third floor.

186
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:28,720
Miss Tracy, we need your help.

187
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:29,960
How much does it pay?

188
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:32,120
Can you do less?

189
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:35,720
We were hoping you do it because
it is the right thing to do.

190
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:38,840
Well, what exactly is it I have to do?

191
00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:42,140
In order to get a warrant.

192
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:45,980
In order to get a warrant.

193
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:51,800
In order to get a warrant,
we need physical evidence.

194
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:52,840
I'm sorry.

195
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:54,700
Go ahead.

196
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:55,800
My photograph.

197
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:57,040
Photograph?

198
00:22:57,070 --> 00:22:59,920
So why don't you guys use
your own inside guy for this?

199
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:03,440
He's afraid to get too involved.

200
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:05,840
We protect our informants.

201
00:23:05,870 --> 00:23:07,600
Yeah, but do you pay them?

202
00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:10,716
Well, we can offer $200.

203
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:12,840
Oh, that's a little cheap,
don't you think, guys?

204
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:16,160
$200 on delivery of the photographs.

205
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:18,660
Will you do it?

206
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:23,076
I don't think I can get into this
whole Nancy Drew shtick.

207
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:28,000
This isn't a game as Tracy,
Cameron King is a very ruthless man,

208
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:31,960
and he won't take too kindly to someone
trying to get evidence on him.

209
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:35,500
I think I can handle Cameron King.

210
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:40,060
So what do I have to do?

211
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:53,960
- Why are you there?
- A little further.

212
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:58,260
Aren't you just so it
comes with my criminal.

213
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:01,940
Come on.

214
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:30,196
I'll take you up.

215
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:31,920
This place always puts me behind.

216
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:33,580
Yeah.

217
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:38,160
You're new, aren't you?

218
00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:39,780
Yeah.

219
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:44,100
Is this elevator always this slow?

220
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:46,956
You've never been up here before?

221
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:49,756
Of course I have.

222
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:51,196
Normally a little close.

223
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:53,240
She told me it was okay.

224
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:56,000
No, I was just trying to help fast.

225
00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:58,480
How did you get up here so fast?

226
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:03,980
Terribly more but color skin.

227
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:13,260
- Hey, babe. How's it going?
- Better.

228
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:19,180
I'm off at three people.

229
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:23,860
No.

230
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:28,760
I can't help but think you could
be doing something work related.

231
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:33,120
Nothing wrong with bettering one's
relationship with coworker, Sebastian.

232
00:26:33,150 --> 00:26:35,076
In fact, I think this is a good time.

233
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:43,100
It's no camp cam come here often?

234
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:50,836
Well, hello there.

235
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:52,920
I'm sorry, sir.

236
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:54,396
That's okay, Sebastian.

237
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:57,820
I could use an escort this evening.

238
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:07,516
So what is it that you want?

239
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:09,700
What do you mean?

240
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:14,180
Catherine, I built a career on knowing
people, and you want something.

241
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:19,540
And you obviously hired me for reasons
other than my photograph skills, right?

242
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:24,760
Yes. You may have made a career out
of it, Cameron, but I had installed a birth.

243
00:27:24,790 --> 00:27:27,920
It's called women's intuition.

244
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:33,420
Well, it doesn't take a genius
to understand my motives.

245
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:36,760
Meaning what?

246
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:38,760
But you're attracted to me now.

247
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:42,380
Why couldn't my mother be this man?

248
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:46,116
Somehow I don't believe
they're that simple.

249
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:49,000
I'm not as complicated as you may think.
You.

250
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:53,320
Perhaps not,
but I still haven't figured you out yet.

251
00:27:53,350 --> 00:27:55,240
Nor are you.

252
00:27:55,270 --> 00:27:57,580
But I will.

253
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:30,756
- Hey, Johnny, can you give me a hand?
- What's up?

254
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:31,876
I think I pulled my back.

255
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:34,236
You didn't get that case
of absolute backup for me?

256
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:35,820
Absolutely.

257
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:38,356
Did you get it?

258
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:40,100
Yeah.

259
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:43,560
Can you just put it
on the bar there for me?

260
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:45,220
Sure.

261
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:47,316
Man. I really appreciate it.

262
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:48,940
Thanks.
Oh, it's an absolute pleasure.

263
00:29:39,664 --> 00:29:41,664
¿Más cartas señor King?

264
00:29:42,688 --> 00:29:44,688
Una más.

265
00:29:51,412 --> 00:29:53,012
¿Qué haces aquí?

266
00:29:53,036 --> 00:29:54,736
Quiero hablar con el señor King.

267
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,760
Hablarás, no te preocupes.

268
00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:02,210
Mr. King.

269
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,670
Up now. Sebastian.

270
00:30:18,870 --> 00:30:23,010
What?
I found the new bartender up here.

271
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,646
How'd you get up here?

272
00:30:24,670 --> 00:30:26,410
I don't know how it happens.

273
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:29,950
I must have dropped my keys.

274
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:32,606
- No, I stole them. 
- Why?

275
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:34,286
Because I wanted to meet with you.

276
00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:35,410
I want to be a dealer.

277
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:38,850
And Sebastian wouldn't
arrange a meeting for us.

278
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,650
How did you know about my little facility?

279
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:44,690
Good dealer knows where the games are.

280
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:47,350
How good are you?

281
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:51,010
Good enough to know who's counting
cards in your group over there.

282
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:53,040
Yeah. Who?

283
00:30:54,164 --> 00:30:56,164
Do I get to be a dealer?

284
00:30:56,560 --> 00:31:01,790
Who the guy in the end of the blue suit?

285
00:31:01,910 --> 00:31:03,810
Well, he's not very good.

286
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:06,610
He's $2,000 in the hole.
Exactly.

287
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,610
He gets close, but he never hits.

288
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,000
Throws suspicion off.

289
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:11,120
What's the point?

290
00:31:11,150 --> 00:31:12,690
The point is he's got a partner.

291
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:18,450
I didn't see enough to
I didn't see enough to know exactly who it

292
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:21,530
is, but it's someone who's
probably making stupid bets.

293
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:22,806
Some miss.

294
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:24,966
No one takes them seriously,
but then he hits.

295
00:31:24,990 --> 00:31:26,266
And when he hits, he hits big.

296
00:31:26,290 --> 00:31:27,730
And everybody thinks he's lucky.

297
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,810
- How do they communicate?
- His chips.

298
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:32,470
He ranges his chips.

299
00:31:43,910 --> 00:31:48,910
- Johnny, take...
- Spence.

300
00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:52,450
Spence, downstairs.

301
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:56,070
I'll talk to you tomorrow
when you come to work.

302
00:31:56,950 --> 00:31:58,710
Thanks.

303
00:32:51,510 --> 00:32:53,246
Sorry about the keys. Shut up.

304
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:54,680
That little stunt you pulled it in.

305
00:32:54,710 --> 00:32:56,210
Made me look like a jerk.

306
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,990
I had to see him. What?

307
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:01,710
Would you just shut up?

308
00:33:10,510 --> 00:33:13,870
You're not still mad at me?

309
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:16,970
I'll just head up for you.

310
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,790
All right.

311
00:34:18,270 --> 00:34:20,270
Come on.

312
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:49,030
I want the pearl.

313
00:34:50,310 --> 00:34:52,470
Is he going?

314
00:34:52,630 --> 00:34:57,710
Well, apparently your boss's
calendar was inaccurate.

315
00:35:04,430 --> 00:35:07,870
Remind him that the auction is Friday.

316
00:35:07,950 --> 00:35:10,590
Get him out of here.

317
00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:24,270
You have promise.

318
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:42,730
What do you want?

319
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:45,560
- I'm here to pick you up.
- For?

320
00:35:45,684 --> 00:35:49,350
I don't know. Mr. King
wants to take you on a picnic.

321
00:35:51,470 --> 00:35:52,526
I'll be right out.

322
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:54,230
Don't.

323
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:50,210
Hi.

324
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:53,646
So, what are we doing?

325
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:57,570
I thought it was a good opportunity for
you to know me outside of the workplace.

326
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:58,810
Any objection?

327
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:03,230
Well, why don't you ask me
again in about an hour?

328
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:06,890
Why then?

329
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:10,190
Because I know you better then.

330
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:51,770
Like it.

331
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,470
Yeah.

332
00:37:54,670 --> 00:37:56,170
But what?

333
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:59,390
It just doesn't seem like you can.

334
00:38:01,270 --> 00:38:04,690
This park actually has a lot
of personal memories for me.

335
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:06,450
You see the house here?

336
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:09,430
I grew up in that house.

337
00:38:13,070 --> 00:38:17,230
And.
I only bring special people here.

338
00:38:17,950 --> 00:38:20,950
Oh, good. I'm famous.

339
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:52,166
I love this park.

340
00:38:52,190 --> 00:38:54,350
When I was a kid,
I used to come here and daydream all

341
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:58,606
the time about what I was
going to do with my life.

342
00:38:58,630 --> 00:39:01,170
There aren't any sandwiches?

343
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,246
Sandwiches?

344
00:39:03,270 --> 00:39:06,050
Oh, I don't mean to be picky or anything,

345
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:10,550
can, but there doesn't seem to be
anything in this basket resembling lunch.

346
00:39:11,070 --> 00:39:16,430
Well, I did tell Sebastian
to pack something romantic.

347
00:39:16,910 --> 00:39:20,410
So this place reminds you of your boyhood?

348
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:21,930
Yeah, it does.

349
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:25,486
In fact, it almost looks exactly
like it did when I was a kid.

350
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:27,690
Except for the statue.

351
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:29,126
It's lovely.

352
00:39:29,150 --> 00:39:32,650
It's really pretty. 
That's st. Michael, the Archangel.

353
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:35,090
I gave it to the city.

354
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:39,970
Kim, you don't seem like the kind of guy
that would donate a saint to the city.

355
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,890
I don't?

356
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:44,930
Well, maybe it was because I
was educated by the Jesuits.

357
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:48,310
I bet you look really cute in the outfit.

358
00:39:48,790 --> 00:39:53,430
Didn't those nuns ever teach you the
importance of the basic four food groups?

359
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:56,100
Well, I'm sorry about the sandwiches.

360
00:39:56,130 --> 00:39:59,430
It's not like Sebastian
to disappoint me like this.

361
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:03,460
Sebastian?
What's the deal with you two, anyway?

362
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:10,820
Well, he makes sure that I get
whatever I want.

363
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:16,100
Well, that must be nice.

364
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:19,040
Whatever you want.

365
00:40:19,070 --> 00:40:20,780
Yes.

366
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:27,420
Whatever I want.

367
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:34,540
What do you want, Catherine?

368
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:40,700
How about a cheeseburger?

369
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:11,040
How are things progressing?

370
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:12,940
Just fine.

371
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:19,140
I have them wrapped
around my little finger.

372
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:27,600
What do you mean?

373
00:42:27,630 --> 00:42:31,120
I mean I think he's going
to take me upstairs tonight.

374
00:42:31,150 --> 00:42:32,470
Really?

375
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:34,320
How do you know?

376
00:42:34,350 --> 00:42:38,000
Because he asked me or told me to dress up

377
00:42:38,030 --> 00:42:40,400
tonight and that he wanted
to show me something.

378
00:42:40,430 --> 00:42:42,520
This could be it.

379
00:42:42,550 --> 00:42:44,700
Are you ready?

380
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:50,040
How does it work?

381
00:42:50,070 --> 00:42:54,200
Aim like this, press like that, and voila.
You have evidence.

382
00:42:54,230 --> 00:42:56,280
Sit for a judge.

383
00:42:56,310 --> 00:42:57,800
Now, you better move along.

384
00:42:57,830 --> 00:43:00,140
I have to look my best.

385
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:06,140
And be careful.

386
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:14,860
I mean it's.

387
00:43:21,940 --> 00:43:23,800
Formation has just arrived from Berlin.

388
00:43:23,830 --> 00:43:25,280
Oh, excellent.

389
00:43:25,310 --> 00:43:26,800
Excellent.

390
00:43:26,830 --> 00:43:29,840
Now our slate is filled.

391
00:43:29,870 --> 00:43:32,800
Everything going okay with the woman?

392
00:43:32,830 --> 00:43:34,820
Catherine?

393
00:43:35,140 --> 00:43:38,320
I find her refreshing.

394
00:43:38,350 --> 00:43:40,880
But this isn't going to last long.

395
00:43:40,910 --> 00:43:44,640
In the meantime,
I'm going to enjoy the sport.

396
00:43:44,670 --> 00:43:47,080
We have a little problem.

397
00:43:47,110 --> 00:43:48,240
What's that?

398
00:43:48,270 --> 00:43:50,240
Our friends in Cairo are having second

399
00:43:50,270 --> 00:43:54,420
thoughts about bringing
cash to the auction.

400
00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:58,440
Well, that's been the arrangement
since the beginning.

401
00:43:58,470 --> 00:44:00,760
Yes, sir, that is what I told.

402
00:44:00,790 --> 00:44:01,790
¿And?

403
00:44:02,614 --> 00:44:04,614
It seems that your decision,

404
00:44:04,670 --> 00:44:08,370
the current incident, has cast some doubt
on our reputation.

405
00:44:08,394 --> 00:44:11,960
Damage, sebastian. Well, maybe the
body shouldn't have been found so easily.

406
00:44:11,990 --> 00:44:13,860
Yes, sir.

407
00:44:17,380 --> 00:44:19,756
- Arrange a meeting with him.
- What?

408
00:44:19,780 --> 00:44:21,280
As soon as possible.

409
00:44:21,310 --> 00:44:22,876
Yes, sir.

410
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:29,100
And let's not let it go as bad as we
did with her Japanese friend Died.

411
00:44:29,140 --> 00:44:31,140
Yes, sir.

412
00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:37,100
Don't worry especially.

413
00:44:37,710 --> 00:44:42,020
By Friday night,
you're going to be a rich man.

414
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:36,960
Okay, boys, clean it up.

415
00:45:36,990 --> 00:45:40,516
A lady's present.
Good evening, Ms.

416
00:45:40,540 --> 00:45:41,920
Tracy.

417
00:45:41,950 --> 00:45:45,060
Apparently the shopping went well.

418
00:45:46,340 --> 00:45:48,100
Yes.

419
00:45:49,180 --> 00:45:51,500
Can you guys kind of be careful
with this wiring thing?

420
00:45:51,530 --> 00:45:53,720
I have to return it in the morning.

421
00:45:53,750 --> 00:45:56,920
You should have a code word
in case something goes wrong.

422
00:45:56,950 --> 00:45:59,316
How about help?

423
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:00,600
I don't think so.

424
00:46:00,630 --> 00:46:01,840
How about money?

425
00:46:01,870 --> 00:46:05,000
You should have no trouble working
that into the conversation.

426
00:46:05,030 --> 00:46:08,860
What are my favorite topics?

427
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:12,920
We need you to zip your gallons.

428
00:46:12,950 --> 00:46:15,820
I don't have a zipper.

429
00:46:39,940 --> 00:46:42,700
Yeah. Places.

430
00:46:43,740 --> 00:46:45,240
Single? Dancing.

431
00:46:45,270 --> 00:46:47,480
You're late.
No, I'm right on time.

432
00:46:47,510 --> 00:46:51,880
Actually, sebastian, could you be
a deer and run and go find Cam?

433
00:46:51,910 --> 00:46:54,076
He's kind of expecting me.

434
00:46:54,100 --> 00:46:57,800
Don't push your luck. Mr.
King.

435
00:46:57,824 --> 00:46:59,824
Sebastian....

436
00:46:59,910 --> 00:47:02,360
You get more beautiful
every time I see you.

437
00:47:02,390 --> 00:47:03,796
Thank you.

438
00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:05,196
You've made it sound so important.

439
00:47:05,220 --> 00:47:07,880
I wanted to look my best.

440
00:47:07,910 --> 00:47:10,220
Come with me.

441
00:47:35,260 --> 00:47:38,440
I thought I would show
you a part of my world.

442
00:47:38,470 --> 00:47:40,940
What is it?

443
00:47:41,100 --> 00:47:46,020
That's what gives me the power
to live life as I chose.

444
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:08,400
Do you run a bordello?

445
00:48:08,430 --> 00:48:10,580
Not quite.

446
00:49:01,660 --> 00:49:03,960
So, what do you think?

447
00:49:03,990 --> 00:49:06,520
It's wonderful.

448
00:49:06,550 --> 00:49:08,050
If you like it.

449
00:49:09,074 --> 00:49:11,074
It must be a gold mine.

450
00:49:11,870 --> 00:49:15,620
Catherine, you're a woman
after my own heart.

451
00:49:15,860 --> 00:49:18,556
It really is amazing.

452
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:19,760
I'm glad you think that.

453
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:22,276
I was afraid you might react differently.

454
00:49:22,300 --> 00:49:26,156
That you might even turn me in.

455
00:49:26,180 --> 00:49:27,480
It's fabulous.

456
00:49:27,510 --> 00:49:32,180
So how much do you pull in cash?

457
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:33,640
She mentioned money?

458
00:49:33,670 --> 00:49:36,560
No, she said cash.

459
00:49:36,590 --> 00:49:38,880
Did we specifically say money,

460
00:49:38,910 --> 00:49:42,600
or do you think she means any
reference to legal tender?

461
00:49:42,630 --> 00:49:43,960
Money.

462
00:49:43,990 --> 00:49:47,660
The word is money.

463
00:49:55,180 --> 00:50:02,360
We've become quite well known now among
the world's so called rich and famous.

464
00:50:02,390 --> 00:50:06,320
And we're practically
impervious to any legal action.

465
00:50:06,350 --> 00:50:08,060
Really?

466
00:50:11,380 --> 00:50:14,940
Sir, may I have a word with you, please?

467
00:50:15,140 --> 00:50:17,236
Catherine, could you give
us a moment, please?

468
00:50:17,260 --> 00:50:19,460
- Sure.
- Thanks.

469
00:50:40,220 --> 00:50:42,520
You're making the bucks, huh?

470
00:50:42,550 --> 00:50:44,500
Bucks?

471
00:50:45,260 --> 00:50:48,460
You haven't done much of this, have you?

472
00:51:16,420 --> 00:51:18,580
What's happening?

473
00:51:24,700 --> 00:51:26,100
What's going on?

474
00:51:26,124 --> 00:51:28,500
Shit. It's got her.

475
00:51:29,740 --> 00:51:31,680
You're the one prepared to move in?

476
00:51:31,710 --> 00:51:35,080
Lady's a born gambler, not me.

477
00:51:35,110 --> 00:51:37,110
I don't like games of chance.

478
00:51:38,034 --> 00:51:40,034
By majoring sailor.

479
00:51:58,180 --> 00:52:00,980
I hate this job.

480
00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:21,780
Was bringing you the final telegram and I

481
00:52:21,810 --> 00:52:24,680
noticed that it's very
beautiful, isn't it?

482
00:52:24,710 --> 00:52:26,600
Yes, sir.

483
00:52:26,630 --> 00:52:29,240
Beauty is a dangerous thing.

484
00:52:29,270 --> 00:52:32,600
Can lead one to make unwise decisions.

485
00:52:32,630 --> 00:52:36,320
Does that advice apply
to the girl as well, too?

486
00:52:36,350 --> 00:52:38,100
Shame.

487
00:52:38,140 --> 00:52:41,660
But I have that situation under control.

488
00:52:43,100 --> 00:52:45,060
Naturally.

489
00:52:57,700 --> 00:53:00,880
So, how'd they turn out?
Come on in.

490
00:53:00,910 --> 00:53:03,140
See if you thought.

491
00:53:18,140 --> 00:53:19,900
Nice.

492
00:53:20,140 --> 00:53:22,120
Very nice.

493
00:53:22,150 --> 00:53:25,540
I'd say those are worth $200.

494
00:53:25,820 --> 00:53:28,320
I'd say it's a good start.

495
00:53:28,350 --> 00:53:30,316
I don't like the sounds of that.

496
00:53:30,340 --> 00:53:32,600
What Lieutenant Martinez
was saying, Miss Tracy?

497
00:53:32,630 --> 00:53:36,980
That we'd have a much
better case if we had more.

498
00:53:37,220 --> 00:53:39,440
Meaning. I don't get my $200?

499
00:53:39,470 --> 00:53:40,720
No.

500
00:53:40,750 --> 00:53:44,580
Which means that there's
more where that came from.

501
00:54:11,260 --> 00:54:16,660
Subject has just left building
and is heading west along the wharf.

502
00:54:18,020 --> 00:54:20,020
Follow that car.

503
00:54:20,544 --> 00:54:21,544
What?

504
00:54:21,590 --> 00:54:24,700
I've been trying to say
that my whole life.

505
00:54:33,780 --> 00:54:36,640
Okay.
Subject is now heading north on Lombard.

506
00:54:36,670 --> 00:54:40,620
He is completely oblivious to my presence.

507
00:54:41,780 --> 00:54:43,660
- You're losing them.
- I am naughty.

508
00:54:43,690 --> 00:54:46,386
- He's right there.
- You're obviously new with this, aren't you?

509
00:54:46,410 --> 00:54:49,120
Lady, I've been driving cab
long and you've been alive.

510
00:54:49,150 --> 00:54:50,640
And you're still so sweet.

511
00:54:50,670 --> 00:54:52,380
Fred.

512
00:55:10,380 --> 00:55:12,156
No, no. Hold on, Fred.

513
00:55:12,180 --> 00:55:18,060
- Meat is running.
- Okay, I just want to watch for 1 minute

514
00:55:42,700 --> 00:55:44,920
 Special people.

515
00:55:44,950 --> 00:55:46,040
What's that?

516
00:55:46,070 --> 00:55:48,280
Nothing, Fred.
Just quartering the line.

517
00:55:48,310 --> 00:55:50,120
I heard once.

518
00:55:50,150 --> 00:55:54,220
So you private Dick or something?

519
00:55:54,620 --> 00:55:56,880
No, Fred, I work for the police.

520
00:55:56,910 --> 00:55:58,240
Undercover.

521
00:55:58,270 --> 00:56:01,120
I had a cousin once who was an informant.

522
00:56:01,150 --> 00:56:03,200
Made plenty of money, too.

523
00:56:03,230 --> 00:56:07,860
Till Tony the Torch put
one through his ear.

524
00:56:16,020 --> 00:56:18,480
No, it's now going to be an auction.

525
00:56:18,510 --> 00:56:21,400
Bidding starts at 1 million, cash.

526
00:56:21,430 --> 00:56:26,520
You told my employer that he would
have exclusive bidding privileges.

527
00:56:26,550 --> 00:56:31,080
Well, the situation changed once I heard
there was so much widespread interest.

528
00:56:31,110 --> 00:56:33,796
You will not be pleased.

529
00:56:33,820 --> 00:56:36,940
Then you don't have to come.

530
00:56:39,580 --> 00:56:43,140
This gives you a spot at the table.

531
00:57:08,020 --> 00:57:10,680
What are they doing here?

532
00:57:10,710 --> 00:57:13,240
Who is this guy, Mob?

533
00:57:13,270 --> 00:57:14,720
I don't know yet, Fred.

534
00:57:14,750 --> 00:57:17,780
I don't know.

535
00:57:21,100 --> 00:57:24,300
Hey, he's leaving.
You want us to follow?

536
00:57:25,180 --> 00:57:26,990
What's the damage so far, Fred?

537
00:57:27,020 --> 00:57:29,310
375.

538
00:57:29,340 --> 00:57:30,510
Can you break a 20?

539
00:57:30,540 --> 00:57:32,440
Exact change only. Perfect.

540
00:57:32,470 --> 00:57:34,420
Keep driving.

541
00:57:44,420 --> 00:57:45,750
Come on, lady.

542
00:57:45,780 --> 00:57:47,120
3 bolws for a buck.

543
00:57:47,150 --> 00:57:48,750
What do you got to lose?

544
00:57:48,780 --> 00:57:50,780
A buck?

545
00:57:52,020 --> 00:57:54,880
Come on, lady, I ain't got any business.

546
00:57:54,910 --> 00:57:56,510
Three for $0.50.

547
00:57:56,540 --> 00:57:59,340
How much for one ball?

548
00:58:00,020 --> 00:58:01,120
A quarter?

549
00:58:01,150 --> 00:58:02,360
Now, look, aim low.

550
00:58:02,390 --> 00:58:06,100
Your center of gravity is
kind of right about here.

551
00:58:07,580 --> 00:58:12,340
Summer job, coney island.

552
00:58:26,420 --> 00:58:29,700
She didn't pay me.

553
00:58:34,700 --> 00:58:36,270
Well, what do you got?

554
00:58:36,300 --> 00:58:38,750
Well, good evening to you, too.

555
00:58:38,780 --> 00:58:40,120
Sorry.

556
00:58:40,150 --> 00:58:44,270
Well, I followed him around today.
Didn't get much.

557
00:58:44,300 --> 00:58:47,400
But I did see something
kind of suspicious.

558
00:58:47,430 --> 00:58:49,180
What?

559
00:58:49,980 --> 00:58:53,740
I saw them at the club first,
and then today they were falling King.

560
00:58:54,770 --> 00:58:57,270
- What else?
- Do you recognize them?

561
00:58:57,300 --> 00:58:58,480
Well, that's it.

562
00:58:58,510 --> 00:59:00,720
You called us out here for that?

563
00:59:00,750 --> 00:59:05,990
Well, I thought you might want
to pull them in for questioning.

564
00:59:06,020 --> 00:59:08,480
The photos did the trick.

565
00:59:08,510 --> 00:59:11,700
We're going to get our warrant.

566
00:59:13,700 --> 00:59:21,700
Will you be going upstairs by the
elevator or the secret entrance?

567
00:59:22,220 --> 00:59:25,020
Secret entrance?

568
00:59:27,100 --> 00:59:33,160
The day I tried to sneak upstairs in the
elevator, Sebastian beat me upstairs.

569
00:59:33,190 --> 00:59:35,960
Now, how could that be?

570
00:59:35,990 --> 00:59:40,990
Unless there's another entrance
and you know where it is?

571
00:59:41,020 --> 00:59:43,200
No, but I do have a pretty good idea.

572
00:59:43,230 --> 00:59:45,720
And with a little incentive.

573
00:59:45,750 --> 00:59:49,600
Unless your inside man can handle it.

574
00:59:49,630 --> 00:59:52,720
All right, 200.

575
00:59:52,750 --> 00:59:54,160
Deal.

576
00:59:54,190 --> 00:59:56,020
Bye.

577
00:59:58,340 --> 01:00:00,820
She's lying.

578
01:00:08,180 --> 01:00:11,900
What's rhe secret entrance crap.?

579
01:00:12,100 --> 01:00:14,750
There is no secret entrance.

580
01:00:14,780 --> 01:00:18,030
She's just trying to soak
a few more dollars out of you.

581
01:00:18,060 --> 01:00:20,030
I knew it.

582
01:00:20,060 --> 01:00:21,440
I haven't got much time.

583
01:00:21,470 --> 01:00:24,980
The raid must happen this Friday.

584
01:00:25,580 --> 01:00:26,830
We can swing that.

585
01:00:26,860 --> 01:00:29,240
We have enough for a warrant.

586
01:00:29,270 --> 01:00:31,880
Why Friday?

587
01:00:31,910 --> 01:00:34,360
He's planning on leaving the country.

588
01:00:34,390 --> 01:00:36,440
That's all I can say.

589
01:00:36,470 --> 01:00:39,100
Good evening, Joe.

590
01:00:42,900 --> 01:00:46,820
You just hold off on celebrating.

591
01:00:52,940 --> 01:00:55,100
Excuse me.

592
01:00:55,260 --> 01:00:56,750
Have you seen Mr.

593
01:00:56,780 --> 01:00:58,680
Kim or Sebastian?

594
01:00:58,710 --> 01:01:00,460
No.

595
01:01:34,940 --> 01:01:36,860


596
01:02:01,580 --> 01:02:03,420


597
01:02:47,740 --> 01:02:49,900
Hold it.

598
01:02:54,340 --> 01:02:58,260
You told me that I would
have your check today.

599
01:03:00,260 --> 01:03:01,480
Well, that's too late.

600
01:03:01,510 --> 01:03:04,740
I leave the country today after the wall.

601
01:03:08,660 --> 01:03:13,220
If you want this club,
you will get that check here today.

602
01:03:37,100 --> 01:03:38,310
Oh, Sebastian.

603
01:03:38,340 --> 01:03:39,720
You scared me.

604
01:03:39,750 --> 01:03:42,830
Did you know that there's
an old stairway back there?

605
01:03:42,860 --> 01:03:44,290
 How far did you go?

606
01:03:44,314 --> 01:03:46,040
Well, I didn't.
I just kind of stepped in.

607
01:03:46,070 --> 01:03:49,000
It's too creepy for me.

608
01:03:50,100 --> 01:03:51,600
How did you find it?

609
01:03:51,630 --> 01:03:55,790
Well, I was reaching in to get something
and my sleep got caught on this insigna

610
01:03:55,820 --> 01:03:57,960
right here and just
clicked open like that.

611
01:03:57,990 --> 01:04:00,300
Do you know what's back there?

612
01:04:01,180 --> 01:04:02,656
What are you doing here this early?

613
01:04:02,680 --> 01:04:05,030
I had to pick up some
films to get developed.

614
01:04:05,060 --> 01:04:07,476
Am I doing something wrong?

615
01:04:07,500 --> 01:04:09,070
This little act may work with Mr.

616
01:04:09,100 --> 01:04:10,676
King, but not with me.

617
01:04:10,700 --> 01:04:11,940
I've seen through your charade

618
01:04:11,970 --> 01:04:17,260
from the beginning and it's time
to put a stop to it right now.

619
01:04:19,020 --> 01:04:20,400
Sebastian, wait.

620
01:04:20,430 --> 01:04:22,680
Look, I know we got off
under the wrong foot.

621
01:04:22,710 --> 01:04:24,030
Look, it's my fault, okay?

622
01:04:24,060 --> 01:04:25,310
Shut up.

623
01:04:25,340 --> 01:04:27,360
Can we just bury the hatches, so to speak?

624
01:04:27,390 --> 01:04:29,700
Just shut up.

625
01:04:32,740 --> 01:04:35,120
Slick little manipulations.

626
01:04:35,150 --> 01:04:39,220
I got to straddle the breath
out of you right now.

627
01:04:42,260 --> 01:04:46,460
Squeeze.
You and your devious schemes don't exist.

628
01:04:48,580 --> 01:04:49,790
Sebastian.

629
01:04:49,820 --> 01:04:51,540
What?

630
01:04:51,860 --> 01:04:55,030
We're at a sour mix.

631
01:04:55,060 --> 01:04:57,000
I'll take care of it in a minute.

632
01:04:57,030 --> 01:05:00,700
I have something else to do first.

633
01:05:16,060 --> 01:05:17,640
Thank you.

634
01:05:17,670 --> 01:05:19,660
Too early.

635
01:05:21,740 --> 01:05:23,640
We have to talk.

636
01:05:23,670 --> 01:05:25,030
What is it now, Sebastian?

637
01:05:25,060 --> 01:05:26,400
Why is she still here?

638
01:05:26,430 --> 01:05:28,680
- Her job is finished.
- Calm down.

639
01:05:28,710 --> 01:05:30,790
-What's the problem?
- Calm down?

640
01:05:30,820 --> 01:05:31,830
She's snooping around.

641
01:05:31,860 --> 01:05:33,860
She can ruin everything.

642
01:05:33,884 --> 01:05:35,389
She's inquisitive.

643
01:05:35,390 --> 01:05:38,480
You really can't be serious.

644
01:05:38,510 --> 01:05:40,540
She's fun. I like her.

645
01:05:40,570 --> 01:05:41,880
It's as simple as that.

646
01:05:41,910 --> 01:05:44,160
You think she feels
the same way about you?

647
01:05:44,190 --> 01:05:46,406
She turned. She went to
the police, for crying out loud.

648
01:05:46,430 --> 01:05:48,310
Well, that's probably why I like her.

649
01:05:48,340 --> 01:05:50,200
She's got a bit of larceny in her heart.

650
01:05:50,230 --> 01:05:51,520
Let's stick to the plan.

651
01:05:51,550 --> 01:05:54,820
It's time to get rid of her.

652
01:05:56,180 --> 01:06:01,740
Sebastian, I'll be needing an extra ticket
for the plane flight tomorrow night.

653
01:06:02,580 --> 01:06:06,260
Or maybe I should just give her yours.

654
01:06:24,500 --> 01:06:26,420
Catherine?

655
01:06:27,380 --> 01:06:29,380
You're alone?

656
01:06:37,900 --> 01:06:40,940
Do you know what your Lurch did to me?

657
01:06:41,340 --> 01:06:44,440
Well, Sebastian can be
a little hot headed.

658
01:06:44,470 --> 01:06:46,920
He tried to kill me.

659
01:06:46,950 --> 01:06:50,700
No, he tried to scare you.

660
01:06:51,140 --> 01:06:52,680
Did a really good job.

661
01:06:52,710 --> 01:06:56,000
Why do you keep him around anyway?

662
01:06:56,030 --> 01:06:59,620
Because he knows how to scare people.

663
01:07:04,740 --> 01:07:06,740
Do you have a passport?

664
01:07:08,100 --> 01:07:09,660
Why?

665
01:07:11,100 --> 01:07:12,830
Do you hungry?

666
01:07:12,860 --> 01:07:14,620
Yeah.

667
01:07:17,300 --> 01:07:19,680
Pretty fancy place.

668
01:07:19,710 --> 01:07:21,516
Yes, it is.

669
01:07:21,540 --> 01:07:23,830
You haven't traveled around much ever?

670
01:07:23,860 --> 01:07:26,280
Yes, I outdroke tears on the back.

671
01:07:26,310 --> 01:07:28,180
You did.

672
01:07:29,620 --> 01:07:35,140
I'm leaving the country tomorrow night
and I'd like you to go with me.

673
01:07:35,740 --> 01:07:38,060
Where are you going?

674
01:07:38,140 --> 01:07:40,300
Where do you want?

675
01:07:42,260 --> 01:07:44,160
Europe, asia?

676
01:07:44,190 --> 01:07:46,820
Wherever you'd like.

677
01:07:47,140 --> 01:07:49,356
Oh... Cameron.

678
01:07:49,380 --> 01:07:51,240
I don't think you'd be very happy with me.

679
01:07:51,270 --> 01:07:56,790
I'm not the sophisticated worldly type.

680
01:07:56,820 --> 01:08:00,780
Well, that's exactly why I like you.

681
01:08:02,140 --> 01:08:05,580
You need someone more like you.

682
01:08:06,540 --> 01:08:09,620
You are like me, Catherine.

683
01:08:09,650 --> 01:08:11,790
You're exactly like me.

684
01:08:11,820 --> 01:08:15,540
You grab everything
the world has to offer.

685
01:08:16,100 --> 01:08:18,310
Which I like.

686
01:08:18,340 --> 01:08:21,550
Well, yes, we do have summer techniques

687
01:08:21,580 --> 01:08:26,070
and I do enjoy
using the one a connoisseur.

688
01:08:26,100 --> 01:08:28,420
Well, thank you.

689
01:08:32,020 --> 01:08:36,460
I want you to think about it seriously.

690
01:08:38,140 --> 01:08:45,380
I think I'm very flattered.

691
01:09:08,820 --> 01:09:10,116
You got it. Yeah.

692
01:09:10,140 --> 01:09:11,196
The auction is at eleven.

693
01:09:11,220 --> 01:09:13,310
Vice will probably bust
in sometime after that.

694
01:09:13,340 --> 01:09:15,520
I can't wait to see
the look on King's mug.

695
01:09:15,550 --> 01:09:16,780
Let's not get cocky yet.

696
01:09:16,810 --> 01:09:18,440
That guy is a slippery one.

697
01:09:18,470 --> 01:09:19,790
Anything else?

698
01:09:19,820 --> 01:09:23,550
No, but I probably won't
see you beforehand.

699
01:09:23,580 --> 01:09:25,440
So wish everyone good luck for me.

700
01:09:25,470 --> 01:09:27,436
Will do. And Mick.

701
01:09:27,460 --> 01:09:29,860
- Yeah.
- Be careful.

702
01:10:02,220 --> 01:10:04,680
Your weekly rent due. Hi.

703
01:10:04,710 --> 01:10:07,960
Listen, I was going to stop
and tell you that I'm moving out.

704
01:10:07,990 --> 01:10:11,060
Well, maybe I should make an inspection.

705
01:10:14,380 --> 01:10:16,660
What's that? Shit?

706
01:10:16,860 --> 01:10:20,550
Oh, I took a livery of kind
of spruce enough place a bit.

707
01:10:20,580 --> 01:10:22,310
What was wrong with it?

708
01:10:22,340 --> 01:10:25,160
- Well, nothing, but...
- That'll cost you.

709
01:10:25,190 --> 01:10:26,780
What?

710
01:10:27,140 --> 01:10:31,116
Because of me, now you can turn around and
rewrite this dump for twice as much money.

711
01:10:31,140 --> 01:10:32,140
I should bill you.

712
01:10:32,210 --> 01:10:35,680
You just kissed your
security deposit goodbye.

713
01:10:41,780 --> 01:10:45,220
You didn't clean the kitchen.

714
01:10:58,900 --> 01:11:02,720
When everything is clear,
I'll knock on the panel.

715
01:11:02,750 --> 01:11:06,020
Are you fully prepared?

716
01:11:06,900 --> 01:11:09,680
I'm always fully prepared.

717
01:11:09,710 --> 01:11:12,880
Well, that's the way it should be.

718
01:11:12,910 --> 01:11:15,940
Give me the key to the elevator

719
01:11:19,340 --> 01:11:21,960
and you know where
to receive your payment?

720
01:11:21,990 --> 01:11:26,820
Sure do, if Sebastian does his job.

721
01:11:53,620 --> 01:11:55,340
Yeah.

722
01:12:09,660 --> 01:12:12,140
Right this way.

723
01:12:20,700 --> 01:12:28,700
All right, we're going through the front.

724
01:12:32,460 --> 01:12:34,830
The first team will work
on empty in the nightclub.

725
01:12:34,860 --> 01:12:35,860
At the same time,

726
01:12:35,920 --> 01:12:39,880
the second team hits the casino on the
third floor through the fire escape.

727
01:12:39,910 --> 01:12:42,070
Any questions? Yeah.

728
01:12:42,100 --> 01:12:44,640
What do I do?
What the hell are you doing here?

729
01:12:44,670 --> 01:12:47,276
Don't you guys want to know
about the secret passage?

730
01:12:47,300 --> 01:12:48,636
Our source says there isn't one.

731
01:12:48,660 --> 01:12:50,066
And he should know better than you.

732
01:12:50,090 --> 01:12:51,640
You better get her out of here.

733
01:12:51,670 --> 01:12:55,380
Yeah, you better get out of here.

734
01:12:56,980 --> 01:13:00,020
Good luck, fella.

735
01:13:14,780 --> 01:13:16,540
Welcome.

736
01:13:17,260 --> 01:13:20,500
Perhaps you know your fellow bitters.

737
01:13:24,260 --> 01:13:26,120
May I offer you some champagne?

738
01:13:26,150 --> 01:13:27,920
No, thank you.

739
01:13:27,950 --> 01:13:30,740
Can we begin now?

740
01:13:32,020 --> 01:13:35,460
We're waiting for one more.

741
01:13:38,660 --> 01:13:41,830
The flight from Marrakash has
been delayed due to a rainstorm.

742
01:13:41,860 --> 01:13:45,440
How long our car is going to pick him up?

743
01:13:45,470 --> 01:13:48,740
He'll be here within a half hour.

744
01:13:49,340 --> 01:13:51,310
We have a slight delay.

745
01:13:51,340 --> 01:13:53,480
You are explicit.

746
01:13:53,510 --> 01:13:57,480
The auction begins precisely at eleven.

747
01:13:57,510 --> 01:14:01,200
Well, he can't be held responsible
for a thunderstorm, can he?

748
01:14:01,230 --> 01:14:05,620
He should have considered
that when he arranged his flight.

749
01:14:05,780 --> 01:14:09,680
We'll wait until 1130
and the auction will begin.

750
01:14:09,710 --> 01:14:11,560
Whether he has arrived or not.

751
01:14:11,590 --> 01:14:13,040
I do not like this one.

752
01:14:13,070 --> 01:14:20,000
Beat, instruct the cashier to give each
of our guests $1,000 worth of chips.

753
01:14:20,030 --> 01:14:21,160
Yes, sir.

754
01:14:21,190 --> 01:14:23,870
I did not come here to play casino games.

755
01:14:23,900 --> 01:14:25,000
I agree.

756
01:14:25,030 --> 01:14:28,660
This is becoming
a monumental waste of time.

757
01:14:30,020 --> 01:14:32,420
That's a goal.

758
01:14:33,460 --> 01:14:35,780
Just a moment.

759
01:15:01,220 --> 01:15:04,660
You should at least hold
it before you leave.

760
01:15:28,020 --> 01:15:30,260
Hey, babe.

761
01:15:32,100 --> 01:15:34,060
Cole.

762
01:15:39,460 --> 01:15:42,360
She likes me. Oh, hey.

763
01:15:42,390 --> 01:15:43,480
We got a winner.

764
01:15:43,510 --> 01:15:44,640
14 red.

765
01:15:44,670 --> 01:15:47,430
14 red. No.

766
01:15:47,460 --> 01:15:49,100
Sorry.

767
01:15:51,420 --> 01:15:59,420
Welcome to Kings.
Ransom table closed.

768
01:16:12,580 --> 01:16:14,500
Sit down.

769
01:16:31,660 --> 01:16:33,870
What are you looking at?

770
01:16:33,900 --> 01:16:34,950
Your head.

771
01:16:34,980 --> 01:16:37,520
How'd you get it to go back like that?

772
01:16:37,550 --> 01:16:41,080
It's a combination of brokering,
mousse and pure virgin olive oil.

773
01:16:41,110 --> 01:16:43,760
My cousin Joey Palucci invented it.

774
01:16:43,790 --> 01:16:45,560
- Joey Palucci?
- Yeah.

775
01:16:45,590 --> 01:16:48,820
You mean Potato Head paluchi.

776
01:16:48,860 --> 01:16:51,200
- You know him?
- Know?

777
01:16:51,230 --> 01:16:53,760
We both did a hit on the same guy once.

778
01:16:53,790 --> 01:16:56,640
I heard about that.

779
01:16:56,670 --> 01:16:58,480
Tony Rocko, right? Yeah.

780
01:16:58,510 --> 01:17:00,280
Lucky for your cousin, I was there.

781
01:17:00,310 --> 01:17:03,160
That ain't what he told me.

782
01:17:03,190 --> 01:17:05,280
Jason One, this is Tango Seven.

783
01:17:05,310 --> 01:17:07,080
We're at the location.

784
01:17:07,110 --> 01:17:10,540
Stand by for instruction.

785
01:17:20,620 --> 01:17:23,420
What are you doing in here?

786
01:17:24,380 --> 01:17:26,080
Looking for Cam.

787
01:17:26,110 --> 01:17:28,156
In his desk?

788
01:17:28,180 --> 01:17:29,320
You know, you're right.

789
01:17:29,350 --> 01:17:32,580
Cam's much bigger than that.
I didn't know that's.

790
01:17:32,610 --> 01:17:33,800
Just a casino.

791
01:17:33,830 --> 01:17:35,080
I don't think so.

792
01:17:35,110 --> 01:17:37,900
You're coming with me.

793
01:17:39,620 --> 01:17:40,950
Black Four.

794
01:17:40,980 --> 01:17:44,260
Close, but no cigar.

795
01:17:53,020 --> 01:17:57,420
I'll check with Sebastian
about our late arrival.

796
01:18:11,660 --> 01:18:13,580
You take over for a while.
I'm dual breaking.

797
01:18:13,610 --> 01:18:16,460
If I don't take a break now,
I'm going to fill my socks.

798
01:18:16,590 --> 01:18:19,140
Thank you very much.

799
01:18:30,020 --> 01:18:33,120
It is very funny that you would
mention imani was having one up.

800
01:18:33,150 --> 01:18:36,950
I had a similar experience in Wagadougu.
No shit.

801
01:18:36,980 --> 01:18:39,220
Yes, shit.

802
01:18:39,940 --> 01:18:42,430
Johnny, I need you in my office.

803
01:18:42,460 --> 01:18:44,260
Yes, sir.

804
01:19:22,180 --> 01:19:23,480
Police Department.

805
01:19:23,510 --> 01:19:28,220
Everyone, please move to the nearest
exit in an orderly fashion.

806
01:19:28,500 --> 01:19:30,480
Open the fire escape. Come on.

807
01:19:30,510 --> 01:19:32,280
I know. I wait there for rage.

808
01:19:32,310 --> 01:19:34,540
You better clear out.

809
01:20:08,220 --> 01:20:09,910
You have the right to an attorney.

810
01:20:09,940 --> 01:20:13,940
If you cannot afford one, one will
be appointed by the state officers.

811
01:20:13,970 --> 01:20:16,316
Stay with your groups. Let's go.

812
01:20:16,340 --> 01:20:17,340
Come on. Come on.

813
01:20:17,340 --> 01:20:21,060
Stay back. Can you move them
back? Let's make some room here.

814
01:20:22,580 --> 01:20:25,060
Let's go, please.

815
01:20:25,460 --> 01:20:27,220
Quickly.

816
01:20:29,140 --> 01:20:30,676
Is king here. No.

817
01:20:30,700 --> 01:20:32,390
Have you seen King?
No, he's not here.

818
01:20:32,420 --> 01:20:34,500
He's not here. Please.

819
01:20:39,860 --> 01:20:41,160
Is king in here?

820
01:20:41,190 --> 01:20:42,316
Has anyone seen King?

821
01:20:42,340 --> 01:20:44,950
- Yeah, someone said he was downstairs.
- Well, let's go.

822
01:20:44,980 --> 01:20:48,340
Go ahead.
I'm going to finish up here.

823
01:20:50,540 --> 01:20:54,460
They need you downstairs,
so I'll take care of this.

824
01:21:28,580 --> 01:21:29,680
I don't think Mr.

825
01:21:29,710 --> 01:21:35,660
King would like to know he's
dealing with a common thiefman.

826
01:21:37,340 --> 01:21:42,220
I just thought I'd
take my money while it's here.

827
01:21:42,300 --> 01:21:45,520
You'll get it precisely
when we said you'd get it.

828
01:21:45,550 --> 01:21:47,320
When we are free and clear.

829
01:21:47,350 --> 01:21:51,100
Now, let's stick to the plan.

830
01:21:55,140 --> 01:21:56,900
Okay?

831
01:22:37,740 --> 01:22:39,950
Looks like the boss got away.

832
01:22:39,980 --> 01:22:42,360
He'll turn up.

833
01:22:42,390 --> 01:22:44,476
I'm going to head back to the precinct.

834
01:22:44,500 --> 01:22:45,800
Can you finish up in there?

835
01:22:45,830 --> 01:22:47,420
Sure.

836
01:23:06,020 --> 01:23:08,980
Everything is clear.

837
01:23:21,660 --> 01:23:23,980
Find it there.

838
01:23:36,220 --> 01:23:38,780
Sorry, Johnny.

839
01:23:46,740 --> 01:23:48,720
Sebastian.

840
01:23:48,750 --> 01:23:52,160
I thought we had a better relationship.

841
01:23:52,190 --> 01:23:54,160
You've been treating me like dirt.

842
01:23:54,190 --> 01:23:56,500
What did you expect?

843
01:24:09,340 --> 01:24:13,100
I never expect too much from anyone.

844
01:24:23,020 --> 01:24:24,640
Don't move.

845
01:24:24,670 --> 01:24:27,076
- What the hell are you doing?
- FBI.

846
01:24:27,100 --> 01:24:28,440
Put your hands behind your head.

847
01:24:28,470 --> 01:24:29,836
You got to be kidding.

848
01:24:29,860 --> 01:24:32,160
You're under arrest for the theft
of the Emperor's pearl,

849
01:24:32,190 --> 01:24:36,436
for the murder of Tommy Kern,
and now for Sebastian Antonelli.

850
01:24:36,460 --> 01:24:40,000
I don't suppose you'd be good enough
to tell us where the Emperor's pearl is.

851
01:24:40,030 --> 01:24:42,880
I don't know what you're talking about.

852
01:24:42,910 --> 01:24:45,460
Thank you.

853
01:24:59,940 --> 01:25:01,156
He's gone.

854
01:25:01,180 --> 01:25:02,996
Looks like we're in the clear.
Yeah.

855
01:25:03,020 --> 01:25:04,196
All right, all right.

856
01:25:04,220 --> 01:25:07,950
Let's not take any chances. Hurry up. Search
the room. He couldn't have gotten far.

857
01:25:07,980 --> 01:25:09,120
Where's Bird?

858
01:25:09,150 --> 01:25:11,060
Right here.

859
01:25:11,380 --> 01:25:14,700
Oh, what happened?
All all right.

860
01:25:14,730 --> 01:25:17,080
Right. Don't worry about it.

861
01:25:17,110 --> 01:25:20,420
Come on, come on.
All right, let's get going.

862
01:25:21,260 --> 01:25:22,556
So where's the pearl?

863
01:25:22,580 --> 01:25:24,720
We have to leave without it.
What?

864
01:25:24,750 --> 01:25:27,140
Not in your life.

865
01:25:29,100 --> 01:25:31,950
Come on, hon.
We've got nearly 10 million here in cash.

866
01:25:31,980 --> 01:25:33,950
Let's not push our luck.

867
01:25:33,980 --> 01:25:39,660
Honey, the whole reason why I want
to pull it off is because of the pearl.

868
01:25:41,020 --> 01:25:44,700
Okay, a few more minutes,
but then we're leaving.

869
01:26:01,220 --> 01:26:02,840
Where are you going with him?

870
01:26:02,870 --> 01:26:05,720
Hey, I set this bust up.

871
01:26:05,750 --> 01:26:06,760
We have it.

872
01:26:06,790 --> 01:26:09,420
You handle a crowd.

873
01:26:09,620 --> 01:26:12,660
Handled crowd?

874
01:26:17,980 --> 01:26:20,940
Serious shit, man.

875
01:26:54,860 --> 01:26:57,836
No silent shit.
All right, that's it.

876
01:26:57,860 --> 01:27:00,160
Round the guys up.
Let's get out of here. Let's get going.

877
01:27:00,170 --> 01:27:02,480
I'm not going anywhere without that pearl.

878
01:27:02,510 --> 01:27:05,000
No, we're out of time.

879
01:27:05,030 --> 01:27:10,716
Okay, you guys go pack up and I'll
meet you by the car, okay?

880
01:27:10,740 --> 01:27:14,080
All right. But you've got 5 minutes.
Otherwise, we're leaving with or without you.

881
01:27:14,110 --> 01:27:15,700
Deal.

882
01:27:31,220 --> 01:27:33,140
Come here.

883
01:27:35,180 --> 01:27:36,840
Mark, are you all right?

884
01:27:36,870 --> 01:27:38,520
Come on.

885
01:27:38,550 --> 01:27:40,460
What happened?

886
01:27:46,940 --> 01:27:48,040
Is he okay?

887
01:27:48,070 --> 01:27:50,540
Yeah, he's coming around.

888
01:28:17,100 --> 01:28:20,860
Smart. Very smart.

889
01:28:22,060 --> 01:28:24,440
See, Catherine?

890
01:28:24,470 --> 01:28:27,000
We are alike.

891
01:28:27,030 --> 01:28:30,300
You take what you want.

892
01:28:31,780 --> 01:28:35,300
But that's not your name, is it?

893
01:28:36,580 --> 01:28:40,160
No, it's Bert.

894
01:28:40,190 --> 01:28:42,660
Robert Chase.

895
01:28:43,380 --> 01:28:48,800
Catherine Tracy Spencer headburn.

896
01:28:48,830 --> 01:28:51,380
How cute.

897
01:28:54,180 --> 01:28:57,800
I can't believe I was
fooled by a stupid girl.

898
01:28:57,830 --> 01:29:02,860
I can't believe you're going
to shoot me over a little money.

899
01:29:04,220 --> 01:29:07,720
I don't like to be toyed with.

900
01:29:07,750 --> 01:29:10,040
Don't be so innocent, Cameron.

901
01:29:10,070 --> 01:29:13,180
You used me as much as I did you.

902
01:29:13,900 --> 01:29:16,540
Know what's really amazing?

903
01:29:17,100 --> 01:29:20,540
I actually liked you.

904
01:29:25,420 --> 01:29:26,440
My mommy stuff.

905
01:29:26,470 --> 01:29:29,820
I don't give a damn about your mother.

906
01:29:31,540 --> 01:29:34,500
I want my pearl.

907
01:29:38,420 --> 01:29:41,060
Put it in the bag.

908
01:29:46,780 --> 01:29:49,100
Goodbye Catherine.

909
01:29:56,780 --> 01:29:59,780
Island is really paying off.

910
01:30:12,100 --> 01:30:14,060
Hold it.

911
01:30:16,500 --> 01:30:18,900
Turn around. Catherine.

912
01:30:19,780 --> 01:30:21,950
Look, like I told you before, Cam,

913
01:30:21,980 --> 01:30:24,800
I didn't mean to hurt any well,
just got a little out of here.

914
01:30:24,830 --> 01:30:26,540
Turn around.

915
01:30:29,620 --> 01:30:31,580
Turn around.

916
01:30:39,100 --> 01:30:42,680
Twice in one night?
Come on, Mrs.

917
01:30:42,710 --> 01:30:44,300
Chase.

918
01:30:46,620 --> 01:30:48,780
The pearl.

919
01:31:00,420 --> 01:31:02,400
Hold it Cameron.

920
01:31:02,430 --> 01:31:04,980
I'll shoot it.

921
01:31:07,860 --> 01:31:10,360
You won't shoot me.

922
01:31:10,384 --> 01:31:13,600
Oh, yeah?
That's where you're rolling.

923
01:31:30,780 --> 01:31:32,740
Wait a minute.

924
01:31:33,820 --> 01:31:36,796
Hi, I'm Catherine Tracy.

925
01:31:36,820 --> 01:31:39,660
And I liked a little gift
for Lieutenant Martinez in the alley.

926
01:31:39,690 --> 01:31:42,860
Could you make sure he gets that?

927
01:31:44,140 --> 01:31:45,480
Thank you, guys.

928
01:31:45,510 --> 01:31:52,640
Come on, boys and girls.

929
01:31:52,670 --> 01:31:54,920
We got ourselves the King's ransom.

930
01:31:54,950 --> 01:31:56,640
Best one yet.

931
01:31:56,670 --> 01:31:58,360
- What's next?
- Whoa.

932
01:31:58,390 --> 01:31:59,480
Not so fast.

933
01:31:59,510 --> 01:32:01,640
You must enjoy the food of your labor first.

934
01:32:01,670 --> 01:32:03,260


935
01:32:26,780 --> 01:32:34,780
14 or twelve well what?

936
01:32:36,340 --> 01:32:38,560
Well, aren't you going
to critique my performance?

937
01:32:38,590 --> 01:32:41,240
You always do.

938
01:32:41,270 --> 01:32:45,360
As a matter of fact you did make it a lot
more complicated than it needed to be.

939
01:32:45,390 --> 01:32:47,440
Just like the royal jewels in Banca.

940
01:32:47,470 --> 01:32:50,080
I just wanted to make a simple switch.

941
01:32:50,110 --> 01:32:53,440
Like it was my fault the prince
wanted me for his fifth wife.

942
01:32:53,470 --> 01:32:55,800
People like me, they always have you.

943
01:32:55,830 --> 01:32:57,460
Interpol.

944
01:32:59,620 --> 01:33:03,680
- Oh, for heaven's sake,
- where's the Emperor's pearl?

945
01:33:03,710 --> 01:33:06,796
Excuse me, but I don't understand what...

946
01:33:06,820 --> 01:33:08,116
Well, I have it right here.

947
01:33:08,140 --> 01:33:10,040
We were hoping to return
it for the reward.

948
01:33:10,070 --> 01:33:13,320
That's the property of the Royal Museum.

949
01:33:13,350 --> 01:33:15,660
There's no reward.

950
01:33:17,180 --> 01:33:18,356
Well, here, take it.

951
01:33:18,380 --> 01:33:20,000
Really, we don't want any problems.

952
01:33:20,030 --> 01:33:22,660
We have a plane to catch.

953
01:33:27,140 --> 01:33:29,356
What the hell do you think you're doing?

954
01:33:29,380 --> 01:33:31,440
- You still don't remember them, do you?
- No.

955
01:33:31,470 --> 01:33:32,760
Who the hell are they?

956
01:33:32,790 --> 01:33:38,320
They were that nice couple who tried to
outcon us in Amsterdam in 1985, I think.

957
01:33:38,350 --> 01:33:39,940
Remember.

958
01:33:40,980 --> 01:33:42,080
The Golden Tulip?

959
01:33:42,110 --> 01:33:48,700
Right, the roulette ball.

960
01:34:01,660 --> 01:34:03,720
The Golden Tulip.

961
01:34:03,750 --> 01:34:07,720
- You were a flirt on that one too?
- I'm sorry, Mr. ambassador.

962
01:34:07,750 --> 01:34:10,040
- A flirt?
- Yeah.

963
01:34:10,070 --> 01:34:12,880
I use what I have to my advantage.

964
01:34:12,910 --> 01:34:15,950
So I've learned to do
with the bad yourself.

965
01:34:15,980 --> 01:34:18,140
You learn to use what I've done.
