1
00:00:39,356 --> 00:00:40,505
<i>I'm gonna tell you something.</i>

2
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:44,307
<i>I been a bad man.</i>

3
00:00:45,451 --> 00:00:48,516
<i>I've been a very bad man, most of my life.</i>

4
00:00:48,858 --> 00:00:50,705
<i>I learned to not trust anybody.</i>

5
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,952
<i>I lost my faith in mankind.</i>

6
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:08,921
<i>I decided I wanna do one thing...</i>

7
00:01:11,267 --> 00:01:12,824
<i>in my life.</i>

8
00:01:14,292 --> 00:01:17,209
<i>One good thing, in my life, before I die.</i>

9
00:01:28,346 --> 00:01:30,470
<i>Even if I die in the process.</i>

10
00:01:32,773 --> 00:01:35,540
<i>I need to do that for my own absolution.</i>

11
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:16,658
John, come on in.

12
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:20,505
As always, I... I appreciate the courtesy.

13
00:02:20,733 --> 00:02:21,821
Please.

14
00:02:27,374 --> 00:02:28,794
We have a situation.

15
00:02:29,015 --> 00:02:32,597
Well... you usually got a situation
when you call me. Ain't that right?

16
00:02:37,452 --> 00:02:40,027
Kamal Mekhi, Afghani national.

17
00:02:40,567 --> 00:02:44,008
He's attempting to procure stealth technology
for the Iranians and I think he can do it.

18
00:02:44,398 --> 00:02:47,355
Intel says that he has very close ties to Pakistan.

19
00:02:47,628 --> 00:02:50,619
But, he's very smart and very well protected.

20
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:56,480
Which folks hired you to hire me, now?

21
00:02:56,831 --> 00:02:59,928
- John, i-it's a new column.
- A new column?

22
00:03:00,195 --> 00:03:02,179
You're a very unique player in our world, John.

23
00:03:03,255 --> 00:03:06,435
And I only come to you when I know
you're the only guy who can do the job.

24
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:13,108
Well, I mean, I can do it quietly, man.
You know that. I can do it quietly.

25
00:03:15,465 --> 00:03:18,579
But if you're using me for some kind of
political gain, I'll come back and kill you.

26
00:03:18,664 --> 00:03:20,009
I just want you to know that.

27
00:03:20,765 --> 00:03:23,274
Listen. Does that mean, uh...
does that mean you'll do it?

28
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,339
It means, I'm gonna check him out.

29
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:30,541
And, um... if turns out that he's really a bad guy

30
00:03:30,679 --> 00:03:33,003
and he's really an enemy of the
United States of America...

31
00:03:33,801 --> 00:03:38,424
or he's really funding terrorist
activity, or any of those things...

32
00:03:39,032 --> 00:03:41,110
I'll make him disappear.

33
00:04:14,594 --> 00:04:15,977
Hey, Johnno.

34
00:04:22,052 --> 00:04:24,824
- How was the flight?
- Long, but good to see you.

35
00:04:26,608 --> 00:04:29,264
Everything's set up. Safe
house and gear, operational.

36
00:04:29,626 --> 00:04:31,983
Exit route goes hot as soon as you make the call.

37
00:04:32,676 --> 00:04:33,931
We playin'?

38
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:36,220
- Hop.
- Rock and Roll.

39
00:04:36,806 --> 00:04:37,944
I'll get started.

40
00:05:40,621 --> 00:05:41,716
How many?

41
00:05:42,087 --> 00:05:44,378
Unknown, two cars, windows blacked out.

42
00:05:51,722 --> 00:05:53,308
Get ready to go in, on my mark.

43
00:06:08,276 --> 00:06:11,025
Diana, stunning, as always.

44
00:06:26,882 --> 00:06:28,884
Thirty girls a month.

45
00:06:30,324 --> 00:06:32,231
You know us men and our appetites.

46
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:35,161
Boss'd actually like to do more.

47
00:06:35,443 --> 00:06:41,669
We can talk. Actually, my uncle is coming
from Kabul, for my aunt's funeral.

48
00:06:42,406 --> 00:06:45,704
And he's very close to Kamal's cousin.

49
00:06:45,756 --> 00:06:50,471
The man with the connections. I
think he'd like to meet the Boss.

50
00:06:50,991 --> 00:06:53,430
He's sick of Kamal.

51
00:06:54,102 --> 00:06:57,333
- Like all of us.
- Well, I'll be sure to pass along the invitation.

52
00:06:57,493 --> 00:07:00,812
Kamal is becoming a real risk.

53
00:07:01,715 --> 00:07:04,506
And you know this, as well as me.

54
00:07:07,539 --> 00:07:10,256
How is the fuckin' Afghani parasite, tonight?

55
00:07:30,429 --> 00:07:34,097
Yeah, I bought them from Diana. She has good taste.

56
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:38,750
You should talk to her, you
know, if chicks are your thing.

57
00:07:39,934 --> 00:07:41,823
But you're certainly not my type.

58
00:07:42,546 --> 00:07:45,040
You know, you've been drawing a lot
of attention to yourself, lately.

59
00:07:45,623 --> 00:07:47,817
I'm not talking about that now.

60
00:07:48,361 --> 00:07:52,532
I don't fucking work for you. There is
only one way the product gets to you.

61
00:07:53,097 --> 00:07:57,115
Me. And I do whatever the fuck I want.
Just like the Boss.

62
00:07:57,173 --> 00:08:00,804
How's that for attracting fucking attention?

63
00:08:01,737 --> 00:08:03,995
The Boss wanted to relay his concerns.

64
00:08:04,207 --> 00:08:06,765
See, some of us really aren't into taking risks.

65
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:11,238
Don't worry. You think I'm a tribal peasant?

66
00:08:11,829 --> 00:08:16,203
I went to Oxford. I'm smarter and
better connected that you'll ever be.

67
00:08:18,777 --> 00:08:20,085
Sure.

68
00:08:20,854 --> 00:08:22,987
But just so you should know,
the Americans aren't happy.

69
00:08:23,045 --> 00:08:26,819
Oh, fuck the Americans. Get the
hell out of here, now what the...

70
00:08:37,608 --> 00:08:40,075
- Have a good night.
- Oh, fuck you!

71
00:08:46,938 --> 00:08:51,826
Now, we're gonna go in, when they come out.
Nobody's gonna see us. Make it clean.

72
00:09:01,462 --> 00:09:03,155
How was the party?

73
00:09:05,583 --> 00:09:08,984
You know, it'd be a shame to be stuck inside
tonight, on such a beautiful evening as this.

74
00:09:10,089 --> 00:09:12,175
Maybe I will take a walk.

75
00:09:12,451 --> 00:09:15,040
Fresh air will do me good.

76
00:11:38,331 --> 00:11:39,766
Hey, what's the score?

77
00:12:39,782 --> 00:12:41,495
One more coming up the stairs.

78
00:12:54,677 --> 00:12:56,166
What the fuck is the...

79
00:13:02,132 --> 00:13:04,527
But I'm protected, what the fuck is...

80
00:13:05,669 --> 00:13:07,575
OK. Take it easy, man. Take it easy.

81
00:13:09,566 --> 00:13:12,301
Listen. Um...

82
00:13:12,718 --> 00:13:17,572
My family is very rich. What the... what is
wrong with you? What's your problem, man?

83
00:13:18,168 --> 00:13:20,149
Where your family got that money?

84
00:13:21,344 --> 00:13:25,003
This is my family business. Is not your business.

85
00:13:25,472 --> 00:13:27,561
Your family business is a problem, but,

86
00:13:27,579 --> 00:13:31,178
your mouth is even a bigger problem.
You're kind of a liability.

87
00:13:31,179 --> 00:13:33,907
And do you think this is about me?
Get out of here, man.

88
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:38,795
No-no-no, it's not about you. It's about my bosses.

89
00:13:40,642 --> 00:13:42,665
You're the American?

90
00:13:50,813 --> 00:13:52,526
Leave the girls.

91
00:15:36,379 --> 00:15:40,082
- Is the shopping done?
- Yeah, man, I got everything that was on the list.

92
00:15:40,241 --> 00:15:42,105
It's all done and done right.

93
00:15:43,374 --> 00:15:47,445
- Anything to return?
- No, man, I'm just waiting for reimbursement.

94
00:15:47,524 --> 00:15:49,783
<i>There's been a timing change.</i>

95
00:15:50,488 --> 00:15:51,978
Well, what does that mean?

96
00:15:52,521 --> 00:15:56,727
The exit route is, uh... closed, well, delayed.
We got a problem on our end.

97
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:00,565
Look, there's nothing to worry about, John.
I would let you know otherwise, alright?

98
00:16:00,612 --> 00:16:03,666
Right now, the exit wagon is
parked, until I get the go, no-go.

99
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:06,539
<i>So, just stay invisible, until I get back to you.</i>

100
00:16:08,027 --> 00:16:09,359
Roger that.

101
00:16:12,261 --> 00:16:14,060
We got a little delay.

102
00:16:15,352 --> 00:16:19,764
- Oh. Should we be concerned?
- I mean, the problem is the job's not over, yet.

103
00:16:19,807 --> 00:16:23,743
What I would recommend is, we go over to
the Danube Club, have a drink and just relax.

104
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:27,484
Lay low. We're ghosts, always ghosts.

105
00:16:28,091 --> 00:16:31,844
- And, uh... we get out of here,  right away.
- OK.

106
00:17:04,881 --> 00:17:08,651
- Give me, uh... some scotch. Johny Walker.
- OK.

107
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,492
And some cigars.

108
00:18:54,244 --> 00:18:55,275
Hey.

109
00:18:57,444 --> 00:18:58,795
Sorry, a little late.

110
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:00,135
I got a massage.

111
00:19:00,323 --> 00:19:02,458
Took me a little bit longer than expected.

112
00:19:02,483 --> 00:19:07,145
- You must have had a massage with a happy ending.
- I'm telling you, the women here are amazing.

113
00:19:07,822 --> 00:19:09,601
You don't see this in Hong Kong.

114
00:19:10,618 --> 00:19:14,786
I don't know, man. Back in the day, were
pretty good in Hong Kong, too, you know.

115
00:19:23,781 --> 00:19:27,085
Let me ask you something. Three years ago...

116
00:19:31,121 --> 00:19:32,716
I was walking by...

117
00:19:37,355 --> 00:19:43,176
You and your boss went to get out of a car and...
there was a little girl in there.

118
00:19:44,051 --> 00:19:47,916
Bad guys jumped up, to kill your boss.

119
00:19:48,256 --> 00:19:50,595
And it looked to me like...

120
00:19:50,845 --> 00:19:55,818
the little girl was gonna die, in the process.
I'm an operator, so it's second nature, for me.

121
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:59,833
I went in and did some bad things to those folks.

122
00:20:00,471 --> 00:20:02,951
And they were gone forever. Just so happens...

123
00:20:02,983 --> 00:20:09,548
the guy I saved... he was one of the big
godfathers of Hong Kong. That was your boss.

124
00:20:11,327 --> 00:20:13,970
He gives you to me, for a year...

125
00:20:14,193 --> 00:20:18,669
as a... gift, for a debt that he thought...

126
00:20:18,838 --> 00:20:20,454
he owes me.

127
00:20:21,649 --> 00:20:25,653
That was three years ago.
Why I can't get rid of you?

128
00:20:32,589 --> 00:20:34,412
Remember the Macau job?

129
00:20:35,607 --> 00:20:36,808
I do.

130
00:20:36,895 --> 00:20:40,214
- Well, you saved my life, on that one.
- That's what we do.

131
00:20:41,123 --> 00:20:42,495
That's what we do.

132
00:20:42,546 --> 00:20:45,499
From that point on, this was no
longer about repaying a debt.

133
00:20:46,033 --> 00:20:50,515
OK? You became my 'hintai.' My brother.

134
00:20:52,226 --> 00:20:54,101
Where I come from, there's a saying.

135
00:21:01,281 --> 00:21:03,719
It means, when the knives come
out, if you're my brother,

136
00:21:03,738 --> 00:21:06,233
I'll be there for you. No words need to be spoken.

137
00:21:06,912 --> 00:21:08,819
As the tong's enforcer,

138
00:21:08,831 --> 00:21:13,092
the Red Pope, I'll do whatever
it takes to honor them.

139
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:17,835
That's how we do, man.

140
00:21:18,014 --> 00:21:21,784
We live together, we die together.
We walk together, we fight together.

141
00:21:22,068 --> 00:21:23,189
Damn right.

142
00:21:35,388 --> 00:21:37,315
Talk about living.

143
00:21:37,495 --> 00:21:38,932
Excuse me, Johnno.

144
00:21:41,893 --> 00:21:42,985
Hey.

145
00:21:45,921 --> 00:21:47,915
- How are you?
- Hi, how are you?

146
00:21:47,972 --> 00:21:50,046
- OK, what's your name?
- I'm Angela.

147
00:21:50,095 --> 00:21:51,966
Angela, OK. I'm Chi.

148
00:21:52,046 --> 00:21:53,104
Hi, Chi.

149
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:22,937
You can run, but I'm gonna catch ya.

150
00:24:14,551 --> 00:24:15,884
Help me.

151
00:24:17,138 --> 00:24:18,238
Help!

152
00:24:18,257 --> 00:24:19,641
Help me.

153
00:24:25,772 --> 00:24:27,272
Help! Help!

154
00:24:33,191 --> 00:24:37,054
Please! Please, help me. They will kill me.
Please, please, help me.

155
00:24:37,274 --> 00:24:39,321
- Please-please-please, please help me.
- This are none of your business.

156
00:24:39,477 --> 00:24:40,817
Don't you touch me, man.

157
00:24:41,976 --> 00:24:43,464
- Stay out of this.
- Please, they will kill me.

158
00:24:43,924 --> 00:24:45,405
That's enough, come on.

159
00:24:50,483 --> 00:24:52,625
You heard the woman. Leave her alone.

160
00:25:06,899 --> 00:25:08,925
- No, you don't...
- Let her go.

161
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:45,415
- We have to leave.
- Separately.

162
00:25:46,059 --> 00:25:48,155
Let me know where to meet with you, though.

163
00:25:54,742 --> 00:25:56,072
Wait!

164
00:26:01,836 --> 00:26:03,668
Please. Please, please.

165
00:26:03,716 --> 00:26:07,175
- What are you doing here, man?
- I ha-I have nowhere to go, OK?

166
00:26:08,938 --> 00:26:10,246
They will kill me.

167
00:26:10,275 --> 00:26:12,568
Well, move fast and get away from here.

168
00:26:13,615 --> 00:26:14,944
Go on.

169
00:26:15,413 --> 00:26:16,904
- Get out of here.
- No.

170
00:26:23,185 --> 00:26:27,168
Listen to me. I have done
everything I can do for you.

171
00:26:27,327 --> 00:26:29,956
Please, get out of the car, you have
very little time, before they come.

172
00:26:30,003 --> 00:26:33,978
I just know you must be an important man, OK?
I see that, and...

173
00:26:34,034 --> 00:26:36,989
what happens to me doesn't matter.
I know that, too.

174
00:26:41,905 --> 00:26:43,685
But you're not like them.

175
00:26:44,003 --> 00:26:45,277
Please.

176
00:26:52,568 --> 00:26:53,966
You're sure I'm not like them, huh?

177
00:26:53,985 --> 00:26:56,964
Yes, you're not like them.
But you're not like them.

178
00:26:57,408 --> 00:26:59,276
- Would you bet your life on it?
- Yes.

179
00:27:14,379 --> 00:27:16,701
Yeah, I'm not like them.

180
00:27:45,316 --> 00:27:48,356
The Afghani got hit tonight. High-end pros.
The perimiter guard guard didn't see a thing.

181
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:50,214
What should we do about it?

182
00:27:50,264 --> 00:27:52,985
Do about it? That waste of space was a liability.

183
00:27:54,252 --> 00:27:56,369
You know what? He just happened to
be the direct line to our product,

184
00:27:56,388 --> 00:27:58,523
so I guess what we're gonna have to do is...

185
00:27:58,535 --> 00:27:59,939
- get another line.
- How are you?

186
00:28:00,314 --> 00:28:02,189
I'm well, this fine night. How about yourself?

187
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:06,135
Thank you, fine. You've got four
messages and Victor needs to see you.

188
00:28:06,252 --> 00:28:07,267
- Thanks.
- Welcome.

189
00:28:07,326 --> 00:28:10,372
Well, there's something else. three of our
men got taken down at the Danube Club.

190
00:28:10,797 --> 00:28:13,537
They were chasing a girl. We
think it's connected to the hit.

191
00:28:13,562 --> 00:28:14,680
What girl?

192
00:28:14,682 --> 00:28:18,487
Well, she was with, uh... our friend.

193
00:28:21,653 --> 00:28:23,010
Shit.

194
00:28:23,499 --> 00:28:26,878
- What about the men?
- Well, he left them alive, on purpose.

195
00:28:27,010 --> 00:28:28,578
- He?
- Yeah.

196
00:28:28,596 --> 00:28:33,096
- So, you're saying one guy did this?
- Well, he had a partner. An Asian guy.

197
00:28:33,137 --> 00:28:35,035
But the girl went with him.

198
00:28:47,704 --> 00:28:49,368
You brought the girl here?

199
00:28:50,062 --> 00:28:53,118
Yeah, I really fucked up, man. I broke protocol.

200
00:28:59,649 --> 00:29:02,153
Listen, there's a lot of
eyes on us, at the club, OK?

201
00:29:02,411 --> 00:29:06,923
Now this girl? We don't know who she is, who's
tryin' to kill her and why. This is dangerous, man.

202
00:29:07,282 --> 00:29:09,833
I just didn't wanna see them
slaughter her, you know?

203
00:29:14,697 --> 00:29:16,504
Alright, what's your plan?

204
00:29:16,696 --> 00:29:19,342
What I was gonna do is just
give her a little bit of money and

205
00:29:19,701 --> 00:29:22,666
drop her off in a safe place. Then
you and I get the fuck out of here.

206
00:29:22,691 --> 00:29:24,442
Yeah, we're gonna need some help.

207
00:29:24,467 --> 00:29:26,660
I got a Russian friend.

208
00:29:26,758 --> 00:29:31,248
I'm gonna call him and see if he can get us
a clean extraction and some of our tools.

209
00:30:04,142 --> 00:30:08,676
You wanna tell me what happened? We kinda need
to know what's goin' on, so we can help you.

210
00:30:13,897 --> 00:30:15,457
You don't wanna know.

211
00:30:15,649 --> 00:30:18,073
Yeah, we better know... if
you want us to help you.

212
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:21,604
If you wanna stay alive, I think you
kinda gotta level with us, otherwise

213
00:30:21,991 --> 00:30:24,368
I'm out. You gotta tell us everything

214
00:30:24,756 --> 00:30:28,379
and you gotta listen to every
motherfucking thing I tell you to do.

215
00:30:28,422 --> 00:30:29,647
They will kill you.

216
00:30:29,672 --> 00:30:31,181
Oh, no.

217
00:30:31,290 --> 00:30:32,997
What shall we do, Chi?

218
00:30:33,031 --> 00:30:34,337
I'm terrified.

219
00:30:34,883 --> 00:30:36,190
Should we run?

220
00:30:38,423 --> 00:30:40,415
Why don't you just humor us?

221
00:30:44,076 --> 00:30:46,335
I was supposed to come here...

222
00:30:47,707 --> 00:30:51,064
to take care of babies, for rich families.

223
00:30:51,824 --> 00:30:53,619
Three years.

224
00:30:55,761 --> 00:30:58,267
Three fucking years!

225
00:31:00,085 --> 00:31:01,888
John, take a look at this.

226
00:31:10,916 --> 00:31:15,199
You wanna tell me about these? I mean,
they were in the coat you were wearing.

227
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:19,650
See, something isn't right and it's really not
smart for us to go ahead and expose ourselves...

228
00:31:20,508 --> 00:31:23,307
without knowing exactly what's happening, so...

229
00:31:24,408 --> 00:31:26,063
I don't know, man.

230
00:31:26,371 --> 00:31:28,022
I'm thinking about maybe...

231
00:31:29,146 --> 00:31:33,322
givin' her some money... and
sendin' her on her way.

232
00:31:33,884 --> 00:31:37,943
Unless she tells me everything, and I
don't think she's telling me everything.

233
00:31:42,392 --> 00:31:45,775
Take a look at this. There's a
page, torn out, with names on it.

234
00:31:47,359 --> 00:31:49,617
Nadia and Sofia.

235
00:31:51,567 --> 00:31:52,965
Who's Sofia?

236
00:31:56,679 --> 00:31:59,579
Sofia was my sister!

237
00:32:04,535 --> 00:32:07,305
And he beat her to death with a pipe!

238
00:32:13,304 --> 00:32:17,299
Do you know who he is, or where he
took you, or anything like that?

239
00:32:20,661 --> 00:32:23,626
It was strange from the start, OK?

240
00:32:27,631 --> 00:32:31,683
A woman came first and... looked us over and...

241
00:32:34,895 --> 00:32:36,788
and then they came.

242
00:32:38,535 --> 00:32:41,296
And they got me, Sofia and two other girls.

243
00:32:41,314 --> 00:32:42,358
These are the girls.

244
00:32:44,705 --> 00:32:49,331
Then they took us to this... nightclub, and...

245
00:32:50,208 --> 00:32:54,910
and we went down, to a strange room...
like a kitchen.

246
00:32:58,452 --> 00:33:01,268
And this guy was there...

247
00:33:01,694 --> 00:33:03,931
with his mask.

248
00:33:10,949 --> 00:33:12,811
Say you aren't afraid!

249
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:17,013
There! You like that?

250
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:24,542
There are some sick people, in this world, OK?

251
00:33:25,666 --> 00:33:28,244
But if they have enough money...

252
00:33:29,367 --> 00:33:32,489
they'll get away with anything!

253
00:33:38,329 --> 00:33:39,521
Bitch!

254
00:33:42,264 --> 00:33:43,764
Look at her.

255
00:33:44,383 --> 00:33:45,903
Look at her.

256
00:34:17,741 --> 00:34:21,116
Someone's... someone's gotta live.

257
00:34:28,255 --> 00:34:31,579
Lay still, or I'll cut you open, you bitch.

258
00:34:34,822 --> 00:34:37,156
Nadia, take the camera! Run!

259
00:34:37,174 --> 00:34:39,274
Run, Nadia, run!

260
00:35:01,544 --> 00:35:04,051
You can run, but I'm gonna catch ya!

261
00:35:10,758 --> 00:35:12,248
Bitch.

262
00:35:20,664 --> 00:35:21,856
OK.

263
00:35:22,626 --> 00:35:25,096
Now, you'll have to pay for this.

264
00:35:41,323 --> 00:35:43,629
She won't get far. Go get her.

265
00:35:48,024 --> 00:35:51,931
You know who he is, or where he
took you, or anything like that?

266
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:54,083
I don't know.

267
00:35:56,330 --> 00:36:01,450
All I know is that... they have a very
powerful syndicate here, and you guys...

268
00:36:02,049 --> 00:36:05,014
you guys, you just beat up their men, at the bar.

269
00:36:08,497 --> 00:36:10,234
Nadia.

270
00:36:11,068 --> 00:36:12,940
I'm gonna tell you something.

271
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:16,344
I've been a bad man.

272
00:36:17,061 --> 00:36:20,410
I've been a very bad man, most of my life.

273
00:36:22,957 --> 00:36:25,616
I learned to not trust anybody.

274
00:36:26,666 --> 00:36:29,727
I lost my faith in mankind.

275
00:36:32,032 --> 00:36:35,532
I believe that everybody out
there, is out there to fuck me.

276
00:36:39,266 --> 00:36:44,872
So, I decided, I wanna do one thing, in my life.

277
00:36:46,402 --> 00:36:49,497
One good thing, in my life, before I die.

278
00:36:50,447 --> 00:36:53,131
Even if I die in the process.

279
00:36:57,135 --> 00:36:59,195
I wanna find this guy.

280
00:37:06,087 --> 00:37:08,821
I wanna find him and I wanna kill him.

281
00:37:11,847 --> 00:37:15,288
I need to do that, for my own absolution.

282
00:37:19,382 --> 00:37:21,193
He had a camera.

283
00:37:22,694 --> 00:37:24,802
When I escaped, I took it.

284
00:37:27,018 --> 00:37:30,636
He filmed everything. Everything!

285
00:37:39,465 --> 00:37:41,916
I can show you where I hid it.

286
00:38:20,514 --> 00:38:23,166
Deathly silence.

287
00:38:23,885 --> 00:38:26,055
It's not a good sign.

288
00:38:26,762 --> 00:38:30,307
Seems we may have hired the
wrong team for the Afghani job.

289
00:38:43,786 --> 00:38:45,193
We?

290
00:38:46,181 --> 00:38:50,018
I guess that'd be me, sir. I hired
the wrong team for the Afghani job.

291
00:38:50,202 --> 00:38:51,703
Shut up, Colt.

292
00:39:04,023 --> 00:39:06,131
We need to sort this shit out.

293
00:39:06,617 --> 00:39:08,526
Get Van Horn on the phone.

294
00:39:09,471 --> 00:39:11,687
Look, I don't know what the
fuck you're talking about.

295
00:39:12,045 --> 00:39:14,441
<i>The Afghani job was going smoothly.</i>

296
00:39:14,666 --> 00:39:18,964
Until three of my men, all of a
sudden, got jumped, in a bar.

297
00:39:19,748 --> 00:39:22,508
Well, that sounds like a bad day,
all around, now, doesn't it?

298
00:39:24,511 --> 00:39:28,806
Do you have any idea how quickly I
can get rid of you and your men?

299
00:39:31,453 --> 00:39:34,950
Look, I thought the Afghani job was...
gonna take care of everything.

300
00:39:35,175 --> 00:39:36,315
Clean, done and done.

301
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:38,314
<i>One of your men has taken a woman.</i>

302
00:39:38,332 --> 00:39:40,054
She belongs to me.

303
00:39:40,455 --> 00:39:42,779
Now you listen, very carefully.

304
00:39:43,564 --> 00:39:45,517
I want her back.

305
00:39:51,470 --> 00:39:55,235
John... now, you didn't say
anything about rescuing a woman.

306
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:57,104
Well, it wasn't exactly part of the plan.

307
00:39:57,299 --> 00:39:59,260
<i>Well, that's gonna be a bit of a problem.</i>

308
00:39:59,303 --> 00:40:03,189
The guy who ordered he hit, he wants to
know why you took her and where she is.

309
00:40:04,248 --> 00:40:06,756
I wonder what he's so interested in her for, man?

310
00:40:06,899 --> 00:40:10,382
Look, that's not a question I was gonna
ask, considering we broke protocol.

311
00:40:10,693 --> 00:40:13,569
Now look, we get the girl back to
them and this all goes away.

312
00:40:15,752 --> 00:40:17,970
Well, remember, you owe me a
lot of fuckin' favors, so

313
00:40:17,995 --> 00:40:21,653
just buy me some time, so I can figure
a way out of this shit. You hear me?

314
00:40:25,791 --> 00:40:28,060
<i>We got the lock. Sending address.</i>

315
00:40:28,139 --> 00:40:29,261
Got it.

316
00:40:30,641 --> 00:40:32,144
We got a lock on him.

317
00:40:33,794 --> 00:40:35,886
Well, go and get my property.

318
00:40:46,579 --> 00:40:47,771
Good.

319
00:40:49,425 --> 00:40:50,617
Right.

320
00:40:51,048 --> 00:40:53,848
Right. Fifteen Tankarnya.

321
00:40:54,526 --> 00:40:57,657
Clean up this mess. Let me know
when you've got the girl.

322
00:41:15,805 --> 00:41:17,820
I'm a friend of John's.

323
00:41:32,897 --> 00:41:34,689
This is Sergei.

324
00:41:34,689 --> 00:41:36,371
He's, uh... my brother.

325
00:41:36,569 --> 00:41:38,249
And you should trust him.

326
00:41:38,322 --> 00:41:40,772
I've trusted him many times.

327
00:41:42,741 --> 00:41:45,740
We're gonna need a clean extraction.
Nice and quiet, nice and quick.

328
00:41:45,788 --> 00:41:48,535
- How soon?
- Well, I'd say, 24 hours, huh?

329
00:41:52,877 --> 00:41:54,297
Give me two hours.

330
00:41:54,794 --> 00:41:58,861
There's a bad guy here that we need to
find and, uh... give him a kiss goodnight.

331
00:41:59,672 --> 00:42:04,229
After we do that, there's a camera we're
gonna grab. And we're out of here.

332
00:42:04,253 --> 00:42:06,253
That's all we want, right now.

333
00:42:06,586 --> 00:42:08,869
You two guys go to the address in the notebook.

334
00:42:08,927 --> 00:42:10,788
Find out who this guy is.

335
00:42:18,803 --> 00:42:20,414
OK, let's rock and roll.

336
00:42:20,446 --> 00:42:22,082
Let's rock and roll.

337
00:43:14,831 --> 00:43:16,920
Hey, buddy, uh... you wanna... you have a light?

338
00:43:18,752 --> 00:43:19,911
Thanks.

339
00:43:30,874 --> 00:43:34,578
I'm gonna ask you a few questions.
Answer, you live. Lie, you die.

340
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:36,002
Understand?

341
00:43:37,757 --> 00:43:39,127
You understand?

342
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:47,695
He only speaks Russian.

343
00:43:48,564 --> 00:43:50,743
That's why I brought my translator.

344
00:43:51,922 --> 00:43:53,129
What's in this building?

345
00:44:03,918 --> 00:44:05,018
Girls.

346
00:44:05,043 --> 00:44:06,244
What girls?

347
00:44:10,376 --> 00:44:12,376
What girls?

348
00:44:15,975 --> 00:44:17,535
Human trafficking.

349
00:44:18,671 --> 00:44:19,963
Tell me who runs it.

350
00:44:22,801 --> 00:44:24,125
Pull 'em.

351
00:44:42,308 --> 00:44:43,735
Jesus!

352
00:44:44,645 --> 00:44:45,927
What'd he say?

353
00:44:47,657 --> 00:44:50,892
He said it's run by the fuckin' syndicate.

354
00:44:51,066 --> 00:44:53,686
Everything's run by the syndicate.
What the fuck is the syndicate?

355
00:44:53,874 --> 00:44:55,316
I'll check my sources.

356
00:45:02,073 --> 00:45:03,265
Hey.

357
00:45:07,721 --> 00:45:09,969
I haven't eaten in days.

358
00:45:11,378 --> 00:45:13,771
And I'm a bit cold, also.

359
00:45:14,024 --> 00:45:17,596
There's a place, couple of doors down.
Some great food.

360
00:45:17,752 --> 00:45:19,834
I'll pick up some clothes, as well.

361
00:45:22,350 --> 00:45:26,253
You're obviously not safe, if you leave here.

362
00:45:29,703 --> 00:45:32,869
Before we start, is there
anything I should know about you?

363
00:45:33,606 --> 00:45:36,736
My father, he used to work
with John, in these regions.

364
00:45:38,630 --> 00:45:41,304
Odessa used to be a safe city.

365
00:45:43,448 --> 00:45:44,856
When?

366
00:45:47,492 --> 00:45:49,391
Before all this.

367
00:45:54,060 --> 00:45:56,790
This is nothing, compared to where I come from.

368
00:46:47,315 --> 00:46:49,383
I'm not gonna go.

369
00:46:49,706 --> 00:46:51,501
I'm gonna be here with you.

370
00:46:54,847 --> 00:46:57,771
I'm just gonna talk to the doctor,
for one second, sweetheart.

371
00:46:58,934 --> 00:47:00,134
OK?

372
00:48:05,356 --> 00:48:08,096
- Nadia, you OK?
- How did they find us?

373
00:48:31,494 --> 00:48:33,652
They'll recognize your face.

374
00:48:36,728 --> 00:48:39,014
Only if I go inside.

375
00:48:56,499 --> 00:48:58,977
Hey, excuse me. Excuse me.

376
00:48:59,420 --> 00:49:01,775
- Hey. Excuse me.
- What?

377
00:49:02,054 --> 00:49:04,995
Do you mind I buy a ticket, for a second?
I need to talk to her. Yeah, come here.

378
00:49:05,396 --> 00:49:06,671
Hey!

379
00:49:06,690 --> 00:49:08,940
Hey, it's me. It's me, Chi. Do you remember me?

380
00:49:09,567 --> 00:49:10,779
- Angela, right?
- Yeah?

381
00:49:10,789 --> 00:49:12,605
Just need to talk to you, for a second, OK?

382
00:49:12,712 --> 00:49:15,514
Now, those guys I was fighting...
hey. Those guys I was fighting?

383
00:49:15,996 --> 00:49:18,669
Who were they? Do you have any idea?
Cops, or anything?

384
00:49:19,491 --> 00:49:20,970
I-I don't know, but...

385
00:49:21,530 --> 00:49:24,380
They had-they had some kind of...
badges, or something. I...

386
00:49:24,523 --> 00:49:25,892
- Some kind of badges?
- Yeah.

387
00:49:26,030 --> 00:49:28,319
What kind badge? Do you have any idea?

388
00:49:29,612 --> 00:49:30,913
Hey, leave him alone!

389
00:49:30,953 --> 00:49:32,431
And do you know where they went?

390
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:35,374
Um... St. Andrew's Hospital?

391
00:49:35,802 --> 00:49:37,711
Somebody took them to St. Andrew's hospital?

392
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:39,029
- Yeah.
- OK.

393
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:45,643
Thank you. I, uh... here's a little something
for you. Just, uh... just keep it.

394
00:49:45,661 --> 00:49:46,674
- Thanks.
- OK. I'll

395
00:49:46,693 --> 00:49:49,730
catch you next time, OK? Alright? You're welcome.

396
00:49:51,961 --> 00:49:53,647
Let's go. Let's go.

397
00:50:22,225 --> 00:50:25,940
These are from the security cameras in the club.
These are the guys, right?

398
00:50:26,226 --> 00:50:28,864
Diplomatic military security.

399
00:50:29,228 --> 00:50:31,706
- How do you know?
- They're not Ukrainian.

400
00:50:32,739 --> 00:50:34,464
I wonder what he's showing them.

401
00:50:50,638 --> 00:50:52,797
Hey, I wanna have a chat with them.

402
00:50:53,184 --> 00:50:54,578
No problem.

403
00:51:07,896 --> 00:51:10,672
We have no contact from the
team we sent to Tankarnaya.

404
00:51:12,827 --> 00:51:15,577
Look, this guy's not going anywhere any time soon.

405
00:51:15,654 --> 00:51:17,274
He's after something.

406
00:51:17,752 --> 00:51:22,078
Whatever it was that the girl took from the Boss...
for some reason, the American wants it now.

407
00:51:23,297 --> 00:51:25,683
Send more than our team. Make
sure they don't fuck this up.

408
00:51:26,052 --> 00:51:28,328
- Will do.
- I'm gonna chat with the Boss.

409
00:51:41,715 --> 00:51:45,215
<i>Fifteen Tankarnya. Copy that. Arriving now.</i>

410
00:51:45,334 --> 00:51:48,524
<i>Make sure you take the girl alive.
Kill everyone else there.</i>

411
00:52:45,305 --> 00:52:47,522
You're hanging around with the wrong people.

412
00:52:54,563 --> 00:52:56,055
Holy fuck!

413
00:53:19,698 --> 00:53:21,973
<i>Victor, he's running with the girl.
I'm on his tail now.</i>

414
00:53:33,008 --> 00:53:35,666
Do you remember exactly where you hid the camera?

415
00:53:36,861 --> 00:53:37,961
Of course.

416
00:53:37,990 --> 00:53:42,212
Well, that would be good, because once we get in
there, we're not gonna have any time, you hear?

417
00:53:42,430 --> 00:53:43,830
Hang on!

418
00:54:06,370 --> 00:54:08,939
Alright, I'll take those two.
Watch my back, alright?

419
00:56:17,453 --> 00:56:19,613
Alright, so tell me about the girl.

420
00:56:20,111 --> 00:56:21,519
Fuck you, chink.

421
00:56:28,754 --> 00:56:32,129
That's Chi, not chink. That's not polite.

422
00:56:32,797 --> 00:56:35,753
Now, when I get pissed off, I
do crazy, fucked up things.

423
00:56:36,525 --> 00:56:40,428
Like pouring hot scalding
water on people's faces, OK?

424
00:56:41,716 --> 00:56:43,686
- So who do you work for?
- Fuck you.

425
00:56:47,388 --> 00:56:48,580
Huh?

426
00:56:49,048 --> 00:56:50,688
We work for the Boss.

427
00:56:52,019 --> 00:56:54,144
The Boss? Who the fuck is the Boss?

428
00:56:54,801 --> 00:56:56,038
What does he want with the girl?

429
00:56:56,063 --> 00:56:57,274
You don't know?

430
00:56:57,299 --> 00:56:59,890
Yeah, I don't know. That's
why I'm asking you, asshole.

431
00:57:08,457 --> 00:57:11,184
Oh, soup! Even better.

432
00:57:36,065 --> 00:57:38,166
<i>Ralphie, I need a favor.</i>

433
00:57:38,291 --> 00:57:40,469
- <i>What can you tell me about the syndicate?</i>
- Shit.

434
00:57:40,487 --> 00:57:41,987
<i>It's important.</i>

435
00:57:45,185 --> 00:57:46,377
Yeah, OK.

436
00:57:50,233 --> 00:57:52,152
- Did you get anything?
- Yeah.

437
00:57:52,195 --> 00:57:54,610
The "Boss." Mean anything to you?

438
00:57:55,350 --> 00:57:58,985
Just checked my sources. He's the
head of the local syndicate.

439
00:58:07,164 --> 00:58:10,557
Yeah, so these guys are operators,
working for someone called the Boss.

440
00:58:10,582 --> 00:58:12,537
Head of the local syndicate.

441
00:58:12,562 --> 00:58:15,024
- <i>You got the camera yet?</i>
- No, we're on our way to get it now.

442
00:58:15,248 --> 00:58:16,694
OK, we'll meet you. Where?

443
00:58:16,919 --> 00:58:18,920
It's a place called Club One.

444
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:21,349
Club One, you know it?

445
00:58:21,739 --> 00:58:24,570
- Would it be open this time of day?
- Yeah, it never closes.

446
00:58:24,595 --> 00:58:25,917
We'll be there in ten.

447
00:59:03,780 --> 00:59:05,221
It should cover it.

448
00:59:11,223 --> 00:59:12,261
Follow me.

449
00:59:32,070 --> 00:59:34,061
The real exit is over there.

450
00:59:43,204 --> 00:59:45,497
Keep your head down, they'll be lookin' for you.

451
00:59:56,629 --> 00:59:58,029
<i>Danko.</i>

452
00:59:58,048 --> 01:00:00,238
- Meet me at Club One.
- <i>The Boss's club?</i>

453
01:00:00,868 --> 01:00:02,069
Yeah, they're here.

454
01:00:36,136 --> 01:00:39,706
- Upstairs. This way.
- Whatever happens, don't run.

455
01:00:40,036 --> 01:00:41,236
Stick onto me, got it?

456
01:00:54,190 --> 01:00:57,479
- So, I see, I hid inside there.
- Alright, get in and out, quick.

457
01:00:57,497 --> 01:00:58,697
OK.

458
01:01:27,164 --> 01:01:30,078
- So, this is the place, huh?
- Da, that's the place.

459
01:01:31,500 --> 01:01:33,065
Never closes, huh?

460
01:01:51,318 --> 01:01:54,573
- You take that side. I'll go here.
- OK.

461
01:02:18,275 --> 01:02:21,190
I want them all. Go.

462
01:02:26,188 --> 01:02:29,492
- You guys go around the back.
- Yeah, I'll have them all soon.

463
01:02:30,310 --> 01:02:31,510
OK.

464
01:02:53,175 --> 01:02:54,367
Hey!

465
01:02:55,984 --> 01:02:58,575
- What are you doing here?
- Hanging out. What are you doing here?

466
01:02:58,586 --> 01:03:00,135
Hanging out.

467
01:03:03,013 --> 01:03:04,108
Go.

468
01:03:04,126 --> 01:03:06,326
- But why?
- Go! Go now!

469
01:03:41,677 --> 01:03:46,517
I figured, if they caught me, they still would
not have the evidence of what that monster...

470
01:03:46,567 --> 01:03:48,715
did to my sister and to the other girls.

471
01:03:50,223 --> 01:03:53,925
- It's what drove me to keep going.
- Ah, you did the right thing.

472
01:03:54,237 --> 01:03:58,541
Your sister's, uh... not be gonna
have died in vain. So, let's do this.

473
01:04:18,330 --> 01:04:19,730
There he is.

474
01:04:20,348 --> 01:04:21,548
John!

475
01:04:59,295 --> 01:05:00,843
Come on. Back door. Go.

476
01:05:30,673 --> 01:05:31,876
Who sent you?

477
01:05:33,396 --> 01:05:34,596
Fuck you!

478
01:05:39,392 --> 01:05:40,657
For Sergei.

479
01:05:51,421 --> 01:05:53,278
Come on, Victor's waiting.

480
01:06:24,896 --> 01:06:27,531
Got you, motherfucker. Come on guys, hurry up!

481
01:06:27,987 --> 01:06:29,588
Put him in the back.

482
01:06:30,563 --> 01:06:32,145
Faster, faster, faster. Go, go, go!

483
01:06:38,035 --> 01:06:39,244
What are we going to do?

484
01:06:39,263 --> 01:06:42,066
We're gonna follow them, and
we're gonna get Chi back,

485
01:06:42,091 --> 01:06:46,349
and then we're gonna probably have to do
some bad things to some of the people there.

486
01:07:51,407 --> 01:07:57,205
Hey, Colt. No, I haven't got the camera. Yeah, I
know. I know. But I have something else, instead.

487
01:07:57,257 --> 01:07:59,112
OK, I just got here.

488
01:08:41,906 --> 01:08:45,447
- Yes, sir.
- Now, why don't you sound surprised?

489
01:08:45,472 --> 01:08:49,299
Well, they located my safe house. I think
you're the only one who coulda done that, so...

490
01:08:49,934 --> 01:08:51,538
Why'd you rat me out?

491
01:08:52,476 --> 01:08:54,932
<i>I admire you, John. Always have.</i>

492
01:08:55,319 --> 01:08:57,147
<i>Always had your six, you know that.</i>

493
01:08:57,513 --> 01:08:59,116
<i>But now you know too much.</i>

494
01:08:59,571 --> 01:09:03,266
Which means it comes down to me and you.
And I'm gonna choose me.

495
01:09:09,559 --> 01:09:11,002
You know better than that, son.

496
01:09:11,421 --> 01:09:13,159
<i>I suppose I do.</i>

497
01:09:13,178 --> 01:09:15,945
<i>See, the thing of it is...</i>

498
01:09:15,984 --> 01:09:17,739
<i>There's a big difference between...</i>

499
01:09:18,798 --> 01:09:20,880
a real warrior and a wannabe.

500
01:09:21,551 --> 01:09:23,579
Wannabes are always talkin'.

501
01:09:24,240 --> 01:09:28,391
And that's the deal with you, Van Horn, you're
always talkin', you always give your position away.

502
01:09:29,524 --> 01:09:31,782
<i>Real warriors, they don't really say much.</i>

503
01:09:32,303 --> 01:09:33,869
<i>They just do what they gotta do.</i>

504
01:09:34,067 --> 01:09:36,053
John, you were supposed to clean up a mess for me.

505
01:09:36,670 --> 01:09:38,993
Clean it up and go away. No harm, no foul.

506
01:09:40,705 --> 01:09:42,542
Now look what you made me do.

507
01:09:42,762 --> 01:09:44,628
<i>And you know how much I hate to travel.</i>

508
01:09:46,474 --> 01:09:51,374
Listen, man... everybody knows
you don't have the camera.

509
01:09:51,936 --> 01:09:54,868
You don't understand, my friend,
it's not about the camera any more.

510
01:09:54,942 --> 01:09:57,130
It's not two against one here, John.

511
01:09:57,174 --> 01:09:58,687
It's two against us.

512
01:10:02,337 --> 01:10:03,775
You nailed a lot of us.

513
01:10:05,203 --> 01:10:06,898
I don't care about the Boss.

514
01:10:09,047 --> 01:10:10,916
<i>I think you're saying you set me up?</i>

515
01:10:12,029 --> 01:10:15,088
This is kind of what we call,
in the old school, a reversal.

516
01:10:15,113 --> 01:10:18,697
If I were you, man, you have to
start lookin', really quick.

517
01:10:19,094 --> 01:10:22,266
Be careful, man, you have to watch your six, now.

518
01:10:23,068 --> 01:10:24,468
Somebody's comin'.

519
01:10:25,144 --> 01:10:27,622
- Alright, listen, I'm gonna give you this.
- John, no, please.

520
01:10:27,647 --> 01:10:29,982
Just listen to me and do what I say.
That was the deal we made.

521
01:10:30,007 --> 01:10:32,203
Take this. Go on.

522
01:10:33,713 --> 01:10:38,196
Point it and you shoot. Stay in the car. Don't
get out of the car for nothin', you hear me?

523
01:10:45,830 --> 01:10:48,172
So, I finally get to meet, Chi.

524
01:10:49,611 --> 01:10:52,502
And I finally get to meet you, Van Horn.

525
01:10:53,834 --> 01:10:56,085
So, what'd my good buddy, John, tell you about me?

526
01:10:57,756 --> 01:11:00,704
He said you're a bald, middle-aged, wannabe.

527
01:11:03,433 --> 01:11:05,236
Shut him up.

528
01:11:12,362 --> 01:11:14,968
Hit me a little harder next time, motherfucker.

529
01:12:02,606 --> 01:12:04,158
He's already here.

530
01:12:05,755 --> 01:12:08,761
You go that way. You come with me.

531
01:14:03,325 --> 01:14:04,904
That's for Sofia.

532
01:14:06,031 --> 01:14:10,875
You bitch. The Boss should have
killed both of you whores.

533
01:14:21,865 --> 01:14:23,427
That's for me.

534
01:17:13,482 --> 01:17:14,682
We're done here.

535
01:17:49,636 --> 01:17:51,439
You got shot, you alright?

536
01:17:53,678 --> 01:17:54,932
Yeah, I'm all good.

537
01:17:55,423 --> 01:17:58,201
See now, don't say I never
did nothing for you, man.

538
01:18:00,025 --> 01:18:03,562
- Guess I still got three years, huh?
- What do you got?

539
01:18:13,838 --> 01:18:15,845
Van Horn's phone, you wanna take a look?

540
01:18:35,922 --> 01:18:37,322
Van Horn?

541
01:18:37,741 --> 01:18:39,540
No, try again.

542
01:18:40,478 --> 01:18:41,926
Been expecting your call.

543
01:18:42,941 --> 01:18:45,521
You have something of mine. I
hope you're gonna give it back.

544
01:18:46,707 --> 01:18:49,206
Man, I have problems with that, you see, uh...

545
01:18:50,011 --> 01:18:53,363
<i>Finally, I figured out why you
ordered Afghani to get killed.</i>

546
01:18:53,388 --> 01:18:55,522
You ordered the hit on Afghani because

547
01:18:55,523 --> 01:18:58,433
he knew about all the sick shit that you do.

548
01:18:58,481 --> 01:19:01,087
<i>You don't want everybody to
know your little secret, right?</i>

549
01:19:01,112 --> 01:19:04,628
- What secret?
- <i>Yeah, your little secret, bitch.</i>

550
01:19:05,319 --> 01:19:09,365
You know, the one that you recorded on your
camera, that you always record on your camera?

551
01:19:09,572 --> 01:19:13,386
All the bad habits that you have
and you record on your camera.

552
01:19:14,909 --> 01:19:18,526
- What do you want?
- <i>I wanna see you in person.</i>

553
01:19:19,738 --> 01:19:22,908
I wanna see you in person. You know?

554
01:19:23,002 --> 01:19:25,207
That'll be good for business, won't it?

555
01:19:25,864 --> 01:19:27,462
<i>Be good for you, good for me.</i>

556
01:19:29,087 --> 01:19:30,361
Yeah, I'm good with that.

557
01:19:31,697 --> 01:19:34,320
What about my nightclub, two hours.

558
01:19:35,196 --> 01:19:38,539
- Right back where it all started.
- Fuck you, bitch.

559
01:19:44,851 --> 01:19:46,043
John.

560
01:20:01,511 --> 01:20:02,989
I got something for you.

561
01:20:04,285 --> 01:20:07,552
That's enough for you to really start a new life.

562
01:20:09,104 --> 01:20:10,642
Get yourself together.

563
01:20:11,677 --> 01:20:12,769
No.

564
01:20:17,469 --> 01:20:19,521
I have nothing to go back to.

565
01:20:24,469 --> 01:20:26,160
I'm not going anywhere.

566
01:20:30,094 --> 01:20:34,283
You are tough, aren't you? Well, hug?

567
01:20:40,582 --> 01:20:41,976
Listen to me.

568
01:20:43,133 --> 01:20:46,497
You're hurt. I want you to take
care of yourself. Take care of her.

569
01:20:48,695 --> 01:20:50,336
How's my boy Sergei?

570
01:20:52,794 --> 01:20:54,194
He didn't make it.

571
01:20:58,913 --> 01:21:00,326
I'll be right back.

572
01:21:38,058 --> 01:21:41,867
Bang on time. Good punctuality. I like that.

573
01:21:42,999 --> 01:21:45,112
Would you like to join me, at my table?

574
01:22:05,428 --> 01:22:06,739
So, here we are.

575
01:22:09,553 --> 01:22:10,753
Now, what do you want?

576
01:22:15,843 --> 01:22:17,062
I want to kill you.

577
01:22:19,964 --> 01:22:22,096
I don't think so, not today.

578
01:22:24,676 --> 01:22:26,064
I'm protected.

579
01:22:26,606 --> 01:22:28,121
So cut the crap.

580
01:22:28,767 --> 01:22:30,103
You got something for me?

581
01:22:32,422 --> 01:22:35,899
Well... as promised, here's your camera.

582
01:22:36,168 --> 01:22:38,707
It's kind of a reminder of all your good work.

583
01:22:46,185 --> 01:22:47,277
Yeah.

584
01:22:49,624 --> 01:22:50,847
Kill him.

585
01:22:55,363 --> 01:22:57,017
Where's your little friend?

586
01:23:16,124 --> 01:23:17,343
Let's finish this.

587
01:23:18,949 --> 01:23:20,489
So you're Chi, huh?

588
01:23:24,524 --> 01:23:26,068
What the fuck are you?

589
01:23:27,761 --> 01:23:29,796
I'm the last thing you're ever gonna see.

590
01:23:44,600 --> 01:23:45,972
That's the best you can do?

591
01:24:43,363 --> 01:24:44,563
Not bad.

592
01:24:44,907 --> 01:24:48,250
I did like those lads. So let's try this.

593
01:24:55,394 --> 01:24:56,866
So sure about that now?

594
01:25:02,960 --> 01:25:04,332
I'm positive.

595
01:25:12,060 --> 01:25:13,927
Alright, you son of a bitch.

596
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:20,827
OK, I think I've had about enough of this shit.

597
01:25:35,997 --> 01:25:37,585
It's time for you to die.

598
01:25:58,356 --> 01:26:00,919
- You're out, bitch.
- What now?

599
01:26:02,366 --> 01:26:04,653
What about up close and personal?

600
01:26:37,264 --> 01:26:39,634
Get up. Get up and fight, bitch.

601
01:26:43,662 --> 01:26:45,737
No, no more.

602
01:27:34,550 --> 01:27:35,814
Why'd you come back?

603
01:27:37,019 --> 01:27:41,599
- When the knives come out...
- No words need to be spoken.

604
01:28:05,423 --> 01:28:07,930
<i>That was the last job I ever did for anybody.</i>

605
01:28:12,276 --> 01:28:14,428
<i>I just figured it was time for a new beginning.</i>

606
01:28:18,557 --> 01:28:21,303
<i>Time for me to turn my sights
in a different direction.</i>

607
01:28:24,607 --> 01:28:26,759
<i>Time for me to start things over.</i>

608
01:29:32,080 --> 01:29:33,290
<i>As for Chi...</i>

609
01:29:33,784 --> 01:29:37,334
<i>with the debt finally paid,
he decided to stay behind.</i>
