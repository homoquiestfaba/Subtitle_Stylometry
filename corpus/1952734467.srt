00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:32,00


1 
00:00:33,631 --> 00:00:35,530 
My name is Charles Bronson. 

2 
00:00:37,481 --> 00:00:40,444 
All my life I wanted to be famous. 

3 
00:00:52,343 --> 00:00:55,004 
<i> Want to know what I have done better </ i> 

4 
00:00:58,709 --> 00:00:59,925 
<i> I had a vocation. </ i> 

5 
00:01:03,148 --> 00:01:06,022 
<i> Only I did not know which one. </ i> 

6 
00:01:09,874 --> 00:01:10,865 
<i> Not yet. </ i> 

7 
00:01:14,256 --> 00:01:15,764 
<i> I could not play. </ i> 

8 
00:01:18,205 --> 00:01:22,508 
A sort of choice of nature .... 

9 
00:04:13,948 --> 00:04:16,365 
The film is based on real facts 

10 
00:04:20,007 --> 00:04:22,932 
<i> How could I explain it? </ i> 

11 
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:35,335 
<i> I was raised normally, 
My parents were decent .... </ I> 

12 
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:39,429 
<i> They were honest citizens. 
Complied by society. </ I> 

13 
00:04:41,039 --> 00:04:44,338 
<i> I went to school. 
I tried not to disappoint them. </ I> 

14 
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:47,864 
<i> But some kids liked problems. </ i> 

15 
00:04:49,052 --> 00:04:50,214 
Son of a bitch! 

16 
00:04:51,044 --> 00:04:52,316 
<i> lot of problems. </ i> 

17 
00:05:10,587 --> 00:05:11,756 
Michael. 

18 
00:05:12,485 --> 00:05:14,718 
Mrs. Peterson I must tell you about the behavior ... 

19 
00:05:16,726 --> 00:05:17,952 
I was not wicked. 

20 
00:05:19,047 --> 00:05:20,211 
I was not evil "villain. 

21 
00:05:21,843 --> 00:05:23,355 
I still have my principles. 

22 
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:30,310 
<i> I took the first job that I should have fallen under the hands ...</ i> 

23 
00:05:31,513 --> 00:05:33,062 
Holds up potatoes, 
Peterson. 

24 
00:05:35,456 --> 00:05:37,526 
<i> I guess the situation 
was not so bad. </ i> 

25 
00:06:08,092 --> 00:06:09,134 
Madam. Peterson? 

26 
00:06:10,116 --> 00:06:11,840 
We would like to talk to your son ... 

27 
00:06:14,965 --> 00:06:15,711 
Michael. 

28 
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:21,840 
Michael Peterson? 

29 
00:06:24,709 --> 00:06:25,117 
That's me. 

30 
00:06:25,777 --> 00:06:30,368 
Ah. Before I forget, I came to the world as Michael Peterson 

31 
00:06:30,411 --> 00:06:32,683 
But I am known by my nickname: 

32 
00:06:33,728 --> 00:06:35,258 
Charles Bronson. 

33 
00:06:41,892 --> 00:06:43,743 
Who is my alter ego. 

34 
00:06:55,327 --> 00:06:57,025 
<i> 1974. </ i> 

35 
00:06:58,587 --> 00:07:00,404 
<i> difficult time for the British youth. </ i> 

36 
00:07:02,016 --> 00:07:03,796 
<i> No chance of love around. </ i> 

37 
00:07:06,566 --> 00:07:06,991 
<i> However ...</ i> 

38 
00:07:08,358 --> 00:07:09,445 
<i> life goes on </ i> 

39 
00:07:11,754 --> 00:07:13,485 
<i> Irene and me we got married </ i> 

40 
00:07:14,522 --> 00:07:19,513 
<i> was pretty ... 
it was not a bad life for a couple of middle class. </ i> 

41 
00:07:20,735 --> 00:07:25,379 
But it does not give you a star on 
The Walk of Fame (Walk of Fame) 
without suffering in return .... 

42 
00:07:35,392 --> 00:07:37,096 
Michael! 
What's that noise? 

43 
00:07:46,724 --> 00:07:51,066 
So ... this is the post office where I went ... 

44 
00:07:52,529 --> 00:07:54,581 
<i> is what I had to live ...</ i> 

45 
00:07:56,858 --> 00:07:58,435 
And that's what they gave me ... 

46 
00:07:59,844 --> 00:08:00,914 
Seven years. 

47 
00:08:02,864 --> 00:08:06,050 
<i> Do not worry, son ... you will not be seven years ....</ i> 

48 
00:08:06,394 --> 00:08:07,613 
You'll be out in four years. 

49 
00:09:21,889 --> 00:09:23,382 
Funny is not it? 

50 
00:09:25,139 --> 00:09:27,526 
I always wanted to be an actor. 

51 
00:09:28,554 --> 00:09:29,782 
Seven years ... 

52 
00:09:31,563 --> 00:09:33,329 
It's very long. 

53 
00:09:38,586 --> 00:09:41,486 
I'm not going to stand here and tell you ... 

54 
00:09:41,611 --> 00:09:47,190 
... You say ... That the prison is not a "folly". 

55 
00:09:47,622 --> 00:09:48,273 
No. 

56 
00:09:48,575 --> 00:09:52,169 
It would be wrong to represent me and I think enough things like this have already been made! 

57 
00:09:52,294 --> 00:09:53,235 
Not true!? 

58 
00:09:54,223 --> 00:09:54,821 
No. 

59 
00:09:59,761 --> 00:10:04,813 
<i> You see, I do not see prison as a cage, a "box" </ i> 

60 
00:10:06,855 --> 00:10:09,810 
<i> For me it was a hotel room </ i> 

61 
00:10:24,976 --> 00:10:26,454 
<i> Do not understand wrong ...</ i> 

62 
00:10:26,769 --> 00:10:28,443 
<i> For the majority of people ...</ i> 

63 
00:10:29,269 --> 00:10:31,486 
<i> The prison is very hard. </ i> 

64 
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:35,070 
<i> With monotonous nightmare </ i> 

65 
00:10:36,494 --> 00:10:38,518 
<i> for 24 hours a day. </ i> 

66 
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:42,032 
<i> Seven days a week. </ i> 

67 
00:10:43,555 --> 00:10:46,771 
<i> 365 days a year </ i> 

68 
00:10:46,789 --> 00:10:50,191 
<i> nothing from a symbol of life. </ i> 

69 
00:10:50,709 --> 00:10:53,327 
<i> breathing ... Hell. </ i> 

70 
00:10:58,361 --> 00:10:59,285 
<i> But for me ...</ i> 

71 
00:11:01,425 --> 00:11:05,315 
The prison was a fun 
where I could show other talents ... 

72 
00:11:06,781 --> 00:11:08,215 
improve my skills. 

73 
00:11:10,076 --> 00:11:14,303 
It's like a battlefield, you see? 
It was an opportunity ... 

74 
00:11:14,705 --> 00:11:18,627 
... In a place where soon everyone will know my name. 

75 
00:11:31,898 --> 00:11:33,148 
What was there, Charlie? 

76 
00:11:34,607 --> 00:11:37,302 
- You want you to watch it again? 
- No. 

77 
00:11:38,312 --> 00:11:41,778 
- I am not usually have a fixed workplace. 
- It is a training practice 

78 
00:11:41,779 --> 00:11:43,887 
- So you can get a job ... 
- Fuck you! 

79 
00:12:05,945 --> 00:12:09,811 
- What is the problem Peterson? 
- Problem? 

80 
00:12:10,626 --> 00:12:13,386 
I said "What is the problem, Peterson?" 

81 
00:12:14,983 --> 00:12:16,385 
I do not know 
I have no problem. 

82 
00:12:20,967 --> 00:12:21,949 
Make shit! 

83 
00:12:50,671 --> 00:12:52,199 
I'm writing my name ... 

84 
00:12:55,550 --> 00:13:03,167 
<i> Charlie, Charlie ...</ i> 

85 
00:13:46,462 --> 00:13:49,195 
- Would you like tea? 
- Thanks, Mickey, I would gladly. 

86 
00:13:49,484 --> 00:13:51,912 
- With milk and sugar? 
- Yes, please. 

87 
00:13:52,037 --> 00:13:53,660 
- How many pieces? 
- Two. 

88 
00:13:53,626 --> 00:13:55,991 
Two ... 

89 
00:14:02,858 --> 00:14:06,797 
<i> Bitch, I want that you start at my feet </ i> 

90 
00:14:06,922 --> 00:14:10,769 
<i> Tea for two

91 
00:14:11,109 --> 00:14:15,897 
<i> Just me for you and for me ...</ i>

00:14:20,723 --> 00:14:22,454 
Would you also a cup of tea? 

94 
00:14:24,721 --> 00:14:27,912 
Nothing brings more joy to my heart as a cup of English tea. 

95 
00:14:28,354 --> 00:14:30,850 
- Sugar and milk? 
- No, I prefer without. 

96 
00:14:37,081 --> 00:14:40,477 
It's an impressive arsenal that you have here, 
it could stop a fight. 

97 
00:14:40,602 --> 00:14:42,721 
Bang! Bang! And Knock-out ... 

98 
00:14:43,265 --> 00:14:44,216 
Ding Ding ... 

99 
00:14:52,871 --> 00:14:53,936 
Very good. 

100 
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:09,775 
Time stands still for no man 
Ladies and Gentlemen. 

101 
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,778 
My time was coming. 

102 
00:15:12,729 --> 00:15:13,781 
The game is over! 

103 
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:19,791 
And just when I was going to be known ... 

104 
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:24,325 
- Like what? 
- Like what!? 

105 
00:15:27,227 --> 00:15:30,773 
You do not want to be stuck with someone like me, "Sunbeam". 

106 
00:15:32,721 --> 00:15:36,953 
A person that nobody likes to annoy you understand? 

107 
00:15:43,347 --> 00:15:45,096 
I'm Charles Bronson. 

108 
00:15:47,201 --> 00:15:49,765 
I am the most dangerous prisoner in England. 

109 
00:15:57,048 --> 00:15:59,178 
<i> The prison was ...</ i> 

110 
00:15:59,178 --> 00:16:00,861 
Seriously speaking ... 

111 
00:16:00,986 --> 00:16:02,339 
Excellent! 

112 
00:16:02,464 --> 00:16:04,592 
I personally enjoyed shit .. and then ... 

113 
00:16:04,602 --> 00:16:05,658 
... I loved it. 

114 
00:16:05,662 --> 00:16:07,311 
It was exciting! 

115 
00:16:07,687 --> 00:16:08,907 
a unique ... 

116 
00:16:09,032 --> 00:16:10,320 
It was magnificent! 

117 
00:16:10,338 --> 00:16:12,549 
And it was the best. 

118 
00:16:15,263 --> 00:16:15,985 
OUT OF CONTROL - DEPARTMENT

CHAOS IN THE PRISON

"I HAVE ALWAYS WANTED TO BE FAMOUS" 

121 
00:16:26,653 --> 00:16:31,147 
The problem is that whenever we feel good, 
t'obligent they change 

122 
00:16:31,165 --> 00:16:33,303

How much I loved this place ...

00:18:23,117 --> 00:18:24,525 
In the end I turned round ... 

136 
00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:27,255 
judiciously in fact ... 

137 
00:18:27,932 --> 00:18:29,135 
I am sent here. 

138 
00:18:30,804 --> 00:18:31,960 
The hospice. 

139 
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:49,521 
What fucking place it will save me now? 

140 
00:20:29,503 --> 00:20:34,345 
Peterson Ok, now that you are calm. 
These are the rules of Rampton. 

141 
00:20:34,901 --> 00:20:37,712 
First rule: 
You do what you say. 

142 
00:20:39,956 --> 00:20:41,043 
And the second rule? 

143 
00:20:43,094 --> 00:20:44,024 
This is not a prison. 

144 
00:20:45,164 --> 00:20:46,450 
There is no limit here. 

145 
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,951 
Ok Take these pills. 

146 
00:20:53,594 --> 00:20:55,715 
Put them up in your fucking ass! 

147 
00:21:11,179 --> 00:21:14,100 
They want to kiss me 
I will not do any of that here. 

148 
00:21:18,228 --> 00:21:20,184 
What do you morons? 

149 
00:21:24,103 --> 00:21:25,447 
Hold on ... 

150 
00:21:28,677 --> 00:21:31,927 
Son of a bitch ... 

151 
00:23:08,873 --> 00:23:09,446 
The thing is that ... 

152 
00:23:11,776 --> 00:23:12,793 
I do not understand. 

153 
00:23:15,827 --> 00:23:17,122 
You'll never understand. 

154

My friend. 

155 
00:23:24,877 --> 00:23:25,893 
While they continue to get high.

What does that make? 

157 
00:23:33,029 --> 00:23:34,664 
They do not change you inside. 

158 
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:39,043 
I think I know the truth. 

159 
00:23:41,414 --> 00:23:43,945 
You're not really mad, is not it? 

160 
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:48,889 
It's just a scene. 

161

You.

A girl of 9 years. 

164 
00:24:09,275 --> 00:24:10,204 
Common sense. 

165 
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:27,408 
Shit ...

Damn fools, they found ... my fault. 

192 
00:27:07,645 --> 00:27:08,636 
Well ... 

193 
00:27:10,878 --> 00:27:12,746 
They are fucking crazy, right? 

194 
00:27:15,052 --> 00:27:17,163 
Now I had to get out of here any way. 

195 
00:27:19,371 --> 00:27:22,484

What I Run ... 

200 
00:30:39,731 --> 00:30:40,757 
What happens there ... 

201 
00:30:40,999 --> 00:30:43,115 
When the murder goes wrong ... 

202 
00:30:49,216 --> 00:30:51,884 
When I come back ...? 

203 
00:30:54,988 --> 00:30:55,691 
Nan, nan. 

204 
00:30:55,692 --> 00:31:01,208 
Mr Peterson, we will not start all this madness, is not it? 

205 
00:31:04,228 --> 00:31:06,347 
Listen ... nurse. 

206 
00:31:06,348 --> 00:31:08,895 
I just want to know when I 
my trial ... 

207 
00:31:09,425 --> 00:31:12,572 
And when I come back to jail. 

208 
00:31:12,807 --> 00:31:13,720 
Is that clear? 

209 
00:31:15,033 --> 00:31:17,153 
Wrong! Mr Peterson 

210 
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:20,700 
Now lean forward ... 

211 
00:31:21,144 --> 00:31:24,971 
I'm just having to push my special potions in the buttocks ... 

212 
00:31:29,818 --> 00:31:32,408 
My trial is happening when? 

213 
00:31:37,702 --> 00:31:38,658 
Not ... 

214 
00:31:39,631 --> 00:31:43,325 
Mr. White will do it, 
there will be no hearing. 

215 
00:31:45,628 --> 00:31:46,950 
Is not this great? 

216 
00:31:48,732 --> 00:31:51,479 
By cons ... You have been transferred. 

217 
00:31:55,521 --> 00:31:56,043 
Where? 

218 
00:32:01,284 --> 00:32:02,805 
Guess Mr. Peterson. 

219 
00:32:02,930 --> 00:32:06,527 
At the asylum for the criminally insane ... 

220 
00:32:12,038 --> 00:32:14,550 
I deserve jail 
for what I did, right? 

221 
00:32:16,297 --> 00:32:19,062 
I want my hotel room again! 

222 
00:32:21,451 --> 00:32:24,528 
I think you will find yourself in solitude ... 

223

Am I an idiot? 

231 
00:33:04,122 --> 00:33:06,956 
If you show wrong with me ... 

232 
00:33:07,912 --> 00:33:13,205 
I'll show you the ultimate 
the dirtiest of dirty tricks ... 

233 
00:33:15,108 --> 00:33:16,255 
Ca .. 

234 
00:33:17,055 --> 00:33:19,376 
is what we'll call "Charlie ... 

235 
00:33:19,501 --> 00:33:22,567 
... against a large wall. 

236 
00:33:39,586 --> 00:33:43,011 
<i> When I Rock and Roll ...</ i>

239 
00:33:54,634 --> 00:33:58,344 
<i> When I Rock and Roll .. </ i> 

240 
00:33:58,469 --> 00:34:02,291

241 
00:34:02,646 --> 00:34:14,876 
<i> When I became a rock star. </ i> 

242 
00:34:30,965 --> 00:34:32,609 
Nobody told me. 

243 
00:34:33,982 --> 00:34:37,711 
The truth was that he wanted me more 
Nowhere in any way whatsoever. 

244 
00:34:38,468 --> 00:34:41,389 
Apparently, I managed to cost the system 

245 
00:34:41,514 --> 00:34:44,266 
Damage of 10 million pounds. 

246 
00:34:44,318 --> 00:34:46,126 
Then his Majesty 

247 
00:34:46,325 --> 00:34:52,827 
no longer wishes to be pampered by the most expensive of all the English prisoners. 

248 
00:34:53,828 --> 00:34:56,705 
However this was not what I was looking ... 

249 
00:34:57,079 --> 00:34:58,931 
But what I should do? 

250 
00:34:59,279 --> 00:35:02,198 
I'd go crazy if a 
I did not try to escape ... 

251 
00:35:05,164 --> 00:35:06,390 
Ah yes ... 

252 
00:35:07,076 --> 00:35:09,701 
They had more than one trick up their sleeve ... 

253 
00:35:11,048 --> 00:35:14,865 
They told me sane ... in writing! 

254 
00:35:15,655 --> 00:35:19,062 
Before you even know I was back in the street ... 

255 
00:35:21,643 --> 00:35:24,468 
But Charlie B is not crazy ... 

256 
00:35:24,886 --> 00:35:25,912 
Non Ho ... 

257 
00:35:26,285 --> 00:35:29,423 
It was then time to breathe fresh air 

258 
00:35:29,623 --> 00:35:31,553 
and show what the world had to offer. 

259 
00:36:07,869 --> 00:36:09,539 
Very funny guys. 

260 
00:36:19,943 --> 00:36:21,039 
It was a pleasure ... 

261 
00:37:38,443 --> 00:37:39,686 
Come in, son. 

262 
00:37:44,424 --> 00:37:45,371 
That's ... 

263 
00:37:45,754 --> 00:37:48,717 
I'll show you your room and 
we make a good cup of tea. 

264 
00:37:58,678 --> 00:37:59,583 
Come ... 

265 
00:38:00,217 --> 00:38:00,991 
That's ... 

266 
00:38:06,988 --> 00:38:08,196 
Oh ... That's me? 

267 
00:38:12,585 --> 00:38:13,846 
I was very small. 

268 
00:38:26,355 --> 00:38:28,275 
Where are all my things? 

269 
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:35,239 
I could not take everything, Michael. 
It was at Luton. 

270 
00:38:38,177 --> 00:38:40,829 
- Everything? 
- It has kept some ... 

271 
00:38:44,350 --> 00:38:45,549 
Where is my bed? 

272 
00:38:46,939 --> 00:38:50,730 
Mama no one there, one I had when I was little. 

273 
00:38:53,771 --> 00:38:57,310 
We could not keep everything Michael 
we had no place. 

274 
00:39:13,555 --> 00:39:15,824 
My bed is still in Luton? 

275 
00:39:17,783 --> 00:39:18,635 
Luton. 

276 
00:39:20,365 --> 00:39:21,504 
It has never changed, is not it? 

277 
00:39:23,111 --> 00:39:26,049 
My mother used to say: 
"Stay with what you love." 

278 
00:39:26,978 --> 00:39:28,387 
Two things had not changed. 

279 
00:39:29,021 --> 00:39:32,306 
I knew Luton and ... 
I knew Uncle Jack. 

280 
00:39:33,583 --> 00:39:35,322 
And Uncle Jack knew everybody. 

281 
00:39:36,234 --> 00:39:38,537 
And while they did not know they were not worth the blow to be known. 

282 
00:39:52,149 --> 00:39:54,296 
- On vacation? 
- No. 

283 
00:39:55,774 --> 00:39:58,261 
I want to know my name. 

284 
00:39:58,878 --> 00:39:59,999 
How do you go? 

285 
00:40:01,077 --> 00:40:02,590 
I'm going to kill the queen. 

286 
00:40:03,189 --> 00:40:05,441 
- Then you go to London. 
- No. 

287 
00:40:07,431 --> 00:40:08,839 
At Luton. 

288 
00:41:43,762 --> 00:41:47,561 
I can not believe my eyes ... 

289 
00:41:48,613 --> 00:41:52,228 
Come my boy, 
You came just in time for cocktails. 

290 
00:42:05,586 --> 00:42:06,934 
Your attention ... 

291 
00:42:07,238 --> 00:42:10,132 
Ladies and gentlemen dressed as women, 

292 
00:42:10,784 --> 00:42:12,836 
Let me show you my favorite nephew. 

293 
00:42:13,071 --> 00:42:15,965 
Recement released from the will of his Majesty. 

294 
00:42:16,739 --> 00:42:17,905 
Mickey Peterson. 

295 
00:42:20,164 --> 00:42:21,590 
Assie up, 
my child. 

296 
00:42:26,518 --> 00:42:31,368 
Miss Magnificent will bring you a cocktail. 

297 
00:42:33,209 --> 00:42:33,861 
Michael 

298 
00:42:36,339 --> 00:42:38,234 
It is a pleasure to meet you. 

299 
00:42:39,130 --> 00:42:42,415 
Ho, Jacky said he was awakened in you party inside. 

300 
00:42:52,742 --> 00:42:53,524 
Thank you. 

301 
00:43:04,329 --> 00:43:05,354 
His face torn. 

302 
00:43:06,328 --> 00:43:07,884 
Kiss should be fun. 

303 
00:43:11,675 --> 00:43:14,508 
It is remarkable that a mustache you got there. 

304 
00:43:15,733 --> 00:43:17,141 
I admire your education. 

305 
00:43:19,488 --> 00:43:22,565 
I always knew you had artistic talent. 

306 
00:43:26,572 --> 00:43:27,816 
It's a big boy. 

307 
00:43:30,110 --> 00:43:32,571 
What does the future to 
Michael Peterson? 

308 
00:44:05,648 --> 00:44:10,707 
Ambition is the virtue of all great men. 

309 
00:44:15,096 --> 00:44:17,791 
He will stay with us. 

310 
00:44:19,651 --> 00:44:21,260 
Agree? 

311 
00:44:23,658 --> 00:44:25,067 
If it suits you. 

312 
00:44:26,249 --> 00:44:27,649 
No more than you. 

313 
00:44:41,017 --> 00:44:42,590 
It's very hard. 

314 
00:44:44,798 --> 00:44:45,650 
Wonderful. 

315 
00:44:48,222 --> 00:44:51,447 
<i> Uncle Jack was always aware of the rumors. </ i> 

316 
00:44:52,037 --> 00:44:55,531 
<i> It appeared that there was a former prisoner who was with me at Luton. </ i> 

317 
00:45:03,306 --> 00:45:05,693 
- Peterson. 
- You smoke? 

318 
00:45:05,818 --> 00:45:08,553 
- Yes. 
- How long did you stop? 

319 
00:45:09,595 --> 00:45:12,099 
- 10 years. 
- Damn! 

320 
00:45:12,486 --> 00:45:14,471 
Make me a cup of tea, please. 

321 
00:45:24,537 --> 00:45:26,962 
Let's go. 

322 
00:45:32,652 --> 00:45:33,408 
So? 

323 
00:45:34,503 --> 00:45:35,719 
Interested? 

324 
00:45:37,477 --> 00:45:39,328 
Damn obviously I am. 

325 
00:45:42,187 --> 00:45:43,751 
You seem very much Mickey. 

326 
00:45:44,177 --> 00:45:45,820 
Fit ... 

327 
00:45:45,831 --> 00:45:46,559 
Tough. 

328 
00:45:48,237 --> 00:45:49,670 
Powerful. 

329 
00:45:51,088 --> 00:45:52,878 
You could make you money. 

330 
00:45:53,860 --> 00:45:55,825 
Not bad money ... 

331 
00:45:57,555 --> 00:45:58,920 
Everything you need is a name. 

332 
00:46:00,554 --> 00:46:02,110 
I'm sure Mickey will do. 

333 
00:46:02,476 --> 00:46:03,978 
No, you need a ... 

334 
00:46:03,979 --> 00:46:05,631 
... name of "war". 

335 
00:46:07,604 --> 00:46:09,430 
Like a movie star. 

336 
00:46:26,579 --> 00:46:28,465 
Charlton Heston. 

337 
00:46:29,342 --> 00:46:30,542 
Listen ... 

338 
00:46:31,047 --> 00:46:34,758 
Everyone has done a cheese 
on Charlton Eston, was a count. 

339 
00:46:37,288 --> 00:46:39,487 
You're more the kind of Charles Bronson. 

340 
00:46:40,495 --> 00:46:42,495 
Charles Bronson ... 

341 
00:46:42,503 --> 00:46:43,434 
Yes ... 

342 
00:46:44,308 --> 00:46:49,071 
"A Death Wish" ... 
It will have its effect. 

343 
00:46:50,732 --> 00:46:54,710 
Charles Bronson. 

344 
00:48:12,425 --> 00:48:13,695 
What do you look? 

345 
00:48:19,561 --> 00:48:21,430 
Confess you look at me, Charlie. 

346 
00:48:27,489 --> 00:48:30,975 
- You want to paint your nails? 
- No. 

347 
00:48:45,030 --> 00:48:47,455 
- Where it comes from? 
- Fighting. 

348 
00:48:49,210 --> 00:48:51,434 
- And that? 
- Fighting ... 

349 
00:48:53,174 --> 00:48:54,821 
Fighting ... 

350 
00:48:57,016 --> 00:48:58,885 
You are very manly eh? 

351 
00:49:00,554 --> 00:49:03,792 
Do you mind if I touch your arm? 

352 
00:49:11,689 --> 00:49:13,262 
My god. 

353 
00:49:14,652 --> 00:49:16,156 
It's huge. 

354 
00:49:25,362 --> 00:49:26,491 
You should ... 

355 
00:49:28,291 --> 00:49:28,986 
What? 

356 
00:49:32,368 --> 00:49:33,793 
You ... You should not ... 

357 
00:49:35,819 --> 00:49:36,758 
What a darling? 

358 
00:49:39,174 --> 00:49:41,739 
You should not heat a guy like me ... 

359 
00:49:45,242 --> 00:49:47,024 
Ho really? 

360 
00:50:14,333 --> 00:50:16,002 
Where's the fucking money? 

361 
00:50:16,472 --> 00:50:17,802 
Ah ok ... 

362 
00:50:29,381 --> 00:50:30,389 
Come! 

363 
00:50:39,447 --> 00:50:41,411 
Where is the fucking money? 

364 
00:50:57,293 --> 00:50:59,492 
20 Books? 
T'essaye of m'entuber right? 

365 
00:50:59,617 --> 00:51:03,787 
Not like Oliver Twist. 
You have to make a name. 

366 
00:51:04,082 --> 00:51:07,260 
- I have given you the pure magic just now. 
- Magic? 

367 
00:51:07,517 --> 00:51:10,290 
You're just pissed on a gypsy in the middle of nowhere ... 

368 
00:51:10,281 --> 00:51:12,758 
A "boss" would do it in the city boy. 

369 
00:51:14,609 --> 00:51:15,938 
Where next? 

370 
00:53:27,791 --> 00:53:29,503 
Let's go! 

371 
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:48,973 
I love you. 

372 
00:53:55,137 --> 00:53:56,058 
What? 

373 
00:54:04,072 --> 00:54:04,915 
I love you ... 

374 
00:54:14,798 --> 00:54:17,449 
It was enjoyable. 

375 
00:54:21,978 --> 00:54:23,246 
But I like Brian. 

376 
00:54:28,679 --> 00:54:30,062 
Who is Brian? 

377 
00:54:33,114 --> 00:54:34,434 
It's my boyfriend. 

378 
00:54:39,885 --> 00:54:41,502 
And he has a motorcycle. 

379 
00:54:47,630 --> 00:54:48,994 
Brian. 

380 
00:54:55,088 --> 00:54:56,887 
Hello sir, may I help you? 

381 
00:55:01,007 --> 00:55:03,390 
I want to see this ring. 

382 
00:55:03,964 --> 00:55:06,771 
This ring is very expensive, sir. 

383 
00:55:07,432 --> 00:55:07,901 
Although ... 

384 
00:55:09,284 --> 00:55:10,161 
Fuck you! 

385 
00:55:11,762 --> 00:55:13,681 
Move over bitch! 

386 
00:55:16,317 --> 00:55:17,204 
Or I'll stumble. 

387 
00:55:17,864 --> 00:55:18,420 
That's ... 

388 
00:55:20,220 --> 00:55:21,941 
Move over bitch! 

389 
00:55:22,906 --> 00:55:26,635 
N'apellez not the police. 
Wait 10 minutes. 

390 
00:55:34,205 --> 00:55:35,570 
15 minutes ... 

391 
00:55:36,804 --> 00:55:38,222 
Merry Christmas. 

392 
00:56:00,344 --> 00:56:02,300 
I thought ... 

393 
00:56:03,247 --> 00:56:05,368 
You are a very gentle man, Charlie. 

394 
00:56:05,855 --> 00:56:07,158 
But thanks to you. 

395 
00:56:09,288 --> 00:56:13,339 
But you have no ambition. 
You know what that means? 

396 
00:56:17,363 --> 00:56:18,241 
Look at this. 

397 
00:56:35,659 --> 00:56:36,563 
Thank you. 

398 
00:56:44,665 --> 00:56:46,804 
I'll get married soon ... 

399 
00:56:57,468 --> 00:56:58,571 
Cool ... 

400 
00:57:01,438 --> 00:57:03,055 
Well ... 

401 
00:57:04,976 --> 00:57:06,854 
Bravo. 

402 
00:57:07,844 --> 00:57:08,705 
Ok? 

403 
00:57:13,668 --> 00:57:15,355 
Goodbye, Charlie. 

404 
00:57:37,253 --> 00:57:38,904 
Damn charming ... 

405 
00:57:39,653 --> 00:57:40,973 
Empty words ... 

406 
00:57:41,990 --> 00:57:43,660 
That's what I say ... 

407 
00:57:45,051 --> 00:57:47,146 
There is always a reason for that 
things happen, is it not? 

408 
00:57:56,716 --> 00:57:57,654 
<i> Magic ...</ i>

Well, well, well ... 

414 
00:59:02,057 --> 00:59:05,074 
Charles Bronson ... ... right? 

415 
00:59:06,290 --> 00:59:10,089 
An American star Mongolian. 

416 
00:59:10,307 --> 00:59:11,480

418 
00:59:14,651 --> 00:59:16,946 
Obviously. 
Thank you. 

419 
00:59:21,302 --> 00:59:23,453 
69 days, eh? 

420 
00:59:25,344 --> 00:59:28,395 
69 days just for you. 

421 
00:59:29,282 --> 00:59:31,733 
Once your archives prison but ... 

422 
00:59:34,419 --> 00:59:36,819 
Tell me, Charles Bronson, 

423 
00:59:37,600 --> 00:59:41,607 
What exactly did you do during those 69 days? 

424 
00:59:43,711 --> 00:59:45,992 
I built an empire. 

425 
00:59:51,724 --> 00:59:53,614 
You are ridiculous. 

426 
01:00:20,313 --> 01:00:22,539 
Hi Charlie. 
You want something to read? 

427 
01:00:23,321 --> 01:00:26,006 
I Judy Cooper. 

428 
01:00:26,980 --> 01:00:30,031 
It's time you change your ideas. 
This one is really good. 

429 
01:00:31,638 --> 01:00:33,273 
Shut your fucking mouth! 

430 
01:00:33,699 --> 01:00:35,941 
Shut your fucking flip! 

431 
01:00:50,796 --> 01:00:51,508 
What? 

432 
01:00:53,334 --> 01:00:56,559 
I'm here with the librarian. 

433 
01:00:58,227 --> 01:01:01,069 
And he has big problems. 

434 
01:01:02,712 --> 01:01:06,563 
I think you should send someone to help, right? 

435 
01:01:16,220 --> 01:01:17,167 
Sit down. 

436 
01:01:18,957 --> 01:01:21,974 
Not sit in this chair, stupid! 

437 
01:01:46,573 --> 01:01:47,573 
And now? 

438 
01:01:49,781 --> 01:01:53,049 
I ... I do not know. 

439 
01:01:58,238 --> 01:02:01,976 
All one has to do is wait .... 

440 
01:02:04,915 --> 01:02:08,740 
I can wait all day. 
I would go nowhere. 

441 
01:02:10,695 --> 01:02:11,555 
I can wait. 

442 
01:02:46,230 --> 01:02:46,622 
Hello? 

443 
01:02:47,908 --> 01:02:49,473 
Hello, Charlie. 

444 
01:02:50,264 --> 01:02:51,177 
You hear me? 

445 
01:02:51,569 --> 01:02:55,902 
Ho fucking ... My ears are very stupid. 

446 
01:02:57,044 --> 01:02:58,435 
<i> What was there, Charlie? </ i> 

447 
01:02:58,713 --> 01:03:00,730 
"What was there, Charlie!?" 

448 
01:03:02,520 --> 01:03:03,077 
Well .. 

449 
01:03:04,894 --> 01:03:07,015 
<i> I'm sitting here ...</ i>

- Ho! Andy Love! 

453 
01:03:23,661 --> 01:03:27,008 
I'll break his neck 
And put his head in his buttocks 

454 
01:03:27,016 --> 01:03:30,015 
If you give me what I want. 

455 
01:03:31,284 --> 01:03:32,632 
What do you want? 

456 
01:03:35,021 --> 01:03:36,351 
What I want? 

457 
01:03:41,072 --> 01:03:42,993 
What did you have me? 

458 
01:03:43,566 --> 01:03:43,957 
Well ... 

459 
01:03:45,730 --> 01:03:47,894 
It depends on you ... 

460 
01:03:49,599 --> 01:03:50,737 
Right? 

461 
01:03:52,327 --> 01:03:54,275 
We finished and you can go to hell. 

462 
01:04:04,462 --> 01:04:05,988 
Andy Love ... 

463 
01:04:07,374 --> 01:04:09,199 
You have family? 

464 
01:04:11,164 --> 01:04:11,842 
Yes. 

465 
01:04:13,163 --> 01:04:15,805 
- Two children. 
- Two children eh? 

466 
01:04:15,930 --> 01:04:18,352 
- What are you doing? 
- What have I done? 

467 
01:04:19,647 --> 01:04:22,125 
You see how ca? 

468 
01:04:22,133 --> 01:04:25,514 
- Let's talk. 
- Enough talk. 

469 
01:04:25,639 --> 01:04:28,035 
It is without interest. 

470 
01:04:28,679 --> 01:04:31,185 
- Wait. 
- Wait for what? 

471 
01:04:33,416 --> 01:04:35,164 
- C'est ca. 
- What will you do? 

472 
01:04:35,207 --> 01:04:37,493 
What will I do? 

473 
01:04:37,885 --> 01:04:42,014 
I am oiling my body. 
That's what I'll do. 

474 
01:04:44,178 --> 01:04:45,186 
Look. 

475 
01:04:46,098 --> 01:04:47,445 
Holy shit. 

476 
01:04:50,365 --> 01:04:53,422 
Etale it in my back. 

477 
01:04:53,642 --> 01:05:00,650 
Put in on my fucking back! 
It was not the whole day. 

478 
01:05:01,006 --> 01:05:06,813 
More in my back and my feet. 

479 
01:05:07,030 --> 01:05:07,821 
My ass. 

480 
01:05:07,946 --> 01:05:10,985 
My ass fucking gay! 
Obey! 

481 
01:05:11,333 --> 01:05:12,403 
Depeche toi! 

482 
01:05:12,455 --> 01:05:17,401 
Faster! 

483 
01:05:17,436 --> 01:05:18,010 
Damn! 

484 
01:05:18,062 --> 01:05:21,096 
Sit in the corner and move more stupid. 

485 
01:05:23,425 --> 01:05:25,989 
Now I know how you feel ... 

486 
01:05:26,407 --> 01:05:28,763 
It's gonna be hell. 

487 
01:06:09,459 --> 01:06:10,616 
Charles Bronson ... 

488 
01:06:12,814 --> 01:06:14,301 
I'll go to goal. 

489 
01:06:14,979 --> 01:06:19,357 
We can not tolerate this behavior too. 

490 
01:06:21,734 --> 01:06:25,045 
We hoped you would come with us to the special unit. 

491 
01:06:25,324 --> 01:06:29,480 
We must stop with this case 
hostage taking. 

492 
01:06:30,360 --> 01:06:31,933 
Attacking my officers ... 

493 
01:06:31,976 --> 01:06:33,567 
We can handle this asshole sir. 

494 
01:06:33,593 --> 01:06:36,479 
We can hold it 
until the end of the Journe, thank you.

Be in my office tomorrow at 6:15 stack 
thank you and goodbye. 

496 
01:06:40,208 --> 01:06:41,060 
Yes, sir. 

497 
01:06:47,561 --> 01:06:52,429 
Listen, I have not habitute to negotiate with the prisoners. 

498 
01:06:53,142 --> 01:06:57,349 
You will be punished again for your recent trip: isolation. 

499 
01:07:00,809 --> 01:07:04,824 
If you absolutely damn your person 

500 
01:07:05,111 --> 01:07:09,152 
You leave us no option of what we will do you. 

501 
01:07:14,681 --> 01:07:18,393 
What would we do 
You, Charles Bronson? 

502 
01:07:22,582 --> 01:07:23,967 
Fuck! 

503 
01:07:30,004 --> 01:07:31,325 
You are pathetic ... 

504 
01:07:32,690 --> 01:07:33,577 
You know. 

505 
01:07:35,610 --> 01:07:36,976 
I promise you this: 

506 
01:07:37,975 --> 01:07:44,121 
If you continue to act unconsciously, to behave in this way 

507 
01:07:44,155 --> 01:07:46,728 
You'll die inside. 

508 
01:08:33,406 --> 01:08:35,954 
1, 2, 3 ... 

509 
01:08:46,419 --> 01:08:47,854 
Four ... 

510 
01:08:50,235 --> 01:08:53,417 
What is that? 
What? 

511 
01:08:54,565 --> 01:08:56,677

Sun, sea and sand.

01:09:04,153 --> 01:09:05,961 
Who is that?

Yes, interesting. 

519 
01:09:50,387 --> 01:09:52,786 
- It means what? 
- What does "interesting"? 

520 
01:09:53,273 --> 01:09:54,724 
Concerned means it's good. 

521 
01:09:57,688 --> 01:09:58,262 
You see? 

522 
01:09:59,652 --> 01:10:03,478 
It can not be clearly defined.

01:10:05,154 --> 01:10:07,683 
You to open a few more features. 

524 
01:10:08,057 --> 01:10:09,908 
It makes me sad.

You know they kept this painting equipment for you.

Sent by your cousin, right? 

544 
01:12:43,632 --> 01:12:48,203 
Unfortunately, it was not 
to focus on the future of your art ... 

545 
01:12:48,647 --> 01:12:52,412 
If you would me that there would not even right.

Not worry about it. 

562

Honestly I'll tell you something, Charlie 

563 
01:14:19,404 --> 01:14:22,949 
Do not be surprised if he anticipates any escape. 

564 
01:14:23,074 --> 01:14:26,602 
It's my opinion. 
This may be not that of others. 

565

And positive thoughts with the hope of so little done

What can you do? 

578 
01:15:13,516 --> 01:15:15,349
