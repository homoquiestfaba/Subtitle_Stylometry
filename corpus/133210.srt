1
00:01:35,492 --> 00:01:37,980
Yeah, I worked
in a barber shop,

2
00:01:38,083 --> 00:01:40,985
But I never considered
myself a barber.

3
00:01:41,092 --> 00:01:45,347
I stumbled into it well,
married into it, more precisely.

4
00:01:45,444 --> 00:01:49,241
It wasn't my establishment.
Like the fella says, I only work here.

5
00:01:52,452 --> 00:01:54,077
The dump was 200 feet square...

6
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:56,958
With three chairs,
or stations, as we call 'em,

7
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:59,260
Even though there are only
two of us working.

8
00:01:59,363 --> 00:02:02,047
But this is my point.

9
00:02:02,147 --> 00:02:05,344
My point is that these traders and trappers
would come to this country,

10
00:02:05,444 --> 00:02:07,549
Get their pelts
and their gold "ignots"

11
00:02:07,812 --> 00:02:10,626
Frank Raffo, my brother-in-law,
was the principal barber.

12
00:02:10,692 --> 00:02:12,066
Man, could he talk.

13
00:02:13,892 --> 00:02:17,504
Maybe if you're 11 or 12 years old,
Frank's got an interesting point of view,

14
00:02:17,572 --> 00:02:19,939
But sometimes
it got on my nerves.

15
00:02:20,035 --> 00:02:21,726
Not that I complained,
mind you.

16
00:02:21,827 --> 00:02:24,161
Like I said, he was
the principal Barber.

17
00:02:25,156 --> 00:02:27,577
Frank's father August
they called him Guzzi

18
00:02:27,684 --> 00:02:30,237
Had worked the heads up
in Santa Rosa for 35 years...

19
00:02:30,339 --> 00:02:33,023
Until his ticker stopped
in the middle of a junior flattop.

20
00:02:33,092 --> 00:02:36,256
He left the shop to Frankie free and clear,

21
00:02:36,355 --> 00:02:38,843
And that seemed to satisfy
all of Frank's ambitions

22
00:02:38,948 --> 00:02:41,631
Cutting the hair
and chewing the fat.

23
00:02:41,732 --> 00:02:44,383
Me, I don't talk much.

24
00:02:49,156 --> 00:02:50,944
I just cut the hair.

25
00:02:58,883 --> 00:03:01,731
It says here that the russians
exploded an a-bomb...

26
00:03:01,828 --> 00:03:04,610
And there's not a damn thing
we can do about it.

27
00:03:07,075 --> 00:03:08,985
How do you like them apples?

28
00:03:14,564 --> 00:03:17,630
Being a barber is a lot like
being a bar man or a soda jerk.

29
00:03:17,891 --> 00:03:21,917
There's not much to it once
you've learned the basic moves.

30
00:03:22,019 --> 00:03:23,907
For the kids, there's the butch,
or the heinie,

31
00:03:23,972 --> 00:03:25,859
The flattop, the ivy,

32
00:03:25,955 --> 00:03:27,646
The crew, the vanguard,

33
00:03:27,748 --> 00:03:29,089
The junior contour...

34
00:03:29,187 --> 00:03:32,503
And occasionally
the executive contour.

35
00:03:33,891 --> 00:03:37,503
lived in a little bungalow
on napa street.

36
00:03:37,571 --> 00:03:39,294
The place was okay, I guess.

37
00:03:39,395 --> 00:03:42,395
Had an electric icebox,
a gas hearth...

38
00:03:42,499 --> 00:03:45,347
And a garbage grinde
built into the sink.

39
00:03:45,444 --> 00:03:47,713
You might say I had it made.

40
00:03:47,812 --> 00:03:50,267
Oh, year,
there was one other thing.

41
00:03:52,035 --> 00:03:54,337
Doris kept the books
at Nirdlingers,

42
00:03:54,403 --> 00:03:56,705
A small department store
on main street.

43
00:03:56,771 --> 00:03:59,138
Doris liked the work,
accounting.

44
00:03:59,203 --> 00:04:01,691
She liked knowing
where everything stood

45
00:04:01,795 --> 00:04:05,472
And she got a ten percent employee
discount on whatever she wanted

46
00:04:05,571 --> 00:04:07,033
Nylon stockings,

47
00:04:07,139 --> 00:04:09,823
Makeup and perfume.

48
00:04:11,651 --> 00:04:14,204
Doris and I went to church
once a week.

49
00:04:15,171 --> 00:04:17,538
Usually Tuesday night.

50
00:04:24,387 --> 00:04:27,137
Doris wasn't big
on divine worship,

51
00:04:27,235 --> 00:04:30,333
And I doubt if she believed
in life everlasting.

52
00:04:30,404 --> 00:04:33,251
She'd most likely tell you
that our reward is on this earth,

53
00:04:33,347 --> 00:04:35,932
And bingo is probably
the extent of it.

54
00:04:36,035 --> 00:04:37,562
B-7

55
00:04:37,667 --> 00:04:38,812
Watch you card,
honey.

56
00:04:38,915 --> 00:04:41,697
I wasn't crazy
about the game,

57
00:04:41,763 --> 00:04:43,771
But, I don't know,
it made her happy,

58
00:04:43,875 --> 00:04:46,842
And I found the setting
peaceful.

59
00:04:46,947 --> 00:04:48,289
Jesus. Bingo.

60
00:04:48,387 --> 00:04:49,533
Bingo!

61
00:04:50,659 --> 00:04:53,180
Doris's boss,
Big Dave Brewster,

62
00:04:53,283 --> 00:04:57,058
Was married to Ann Nirdlinger,
the department store heiress.

63
00:04:57,123 --> 00:04:59,262
Tonight they were coming over for dinner.

64
00:04:59,331 --> 00:05:01,022
As Doris said,

65
00:05:01,123 --> 00:05:03,458
We were entertaining.

66
00:05:06,371 --> 00:05:08,444
Me, I don't like
entertaining.

67
00:05:11,459 --> 00:05:13,346
- How you doin', Ed?
- Okay.

68
00:05:13,443 --> 00:05:15,167
Take your coat, Ann?

69
00:05:15,267 --> 00:05:18,563
The japs had us pinned down
on Buna for somethin' like six weeks.

70
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:21,820
I gotta tell ya,
I thought we had it tough,
but we had supply.

71
00:05:21,923 --> 00:05:26,113
The japs were eatin' bugs
and grubs and thistles.

72
00:05:26,211 --> 00:05:28,928
Anyway, one day
we bust off the beach...

73
00:05:29,027 --> 00:05:32,889
And we find Arney Bragg,
this kid missin' on recon.

74
00:05:32,995 --> 00:05:35,613
the japs had eaten the son of a bitch.

75
00:05:35,715 --> 00:05:37,657
If you'll pardon the, uh...

76
00:05:37,764 --> 00:05:41,375
Anyway, he was a scrawny, pimply kid,
nothin' to write home about.

77
00:05:41,475 --> 00:05:43,362
I mean, I never woulda,
you know.

78
00:05:45,827 --> 00:05:48,096
So, what do I say, honey?

79
00:05:48,163 --> 00:05:50,880
What do I say
when I don't like dinner?

80
00:05:50,979 --> 00:05:52,408
Come on.
what do I say?

81
00:05:52,516 --> 00:05:54,905
I say,
"Arney Bragg, again?"

82
00:05:59,651 --> 00:06:01,506
Arney Bragg, again?

83
00:06:07,587 --> 00:06:10,304
- Were you in the service, Ed?
- No, Dave, I wasn't.

84
00:06:10,404 --> 00:06:13,699
Ed was 4-f on account
of his fallen arches.

85
00:06:18,403 --> 00:06:19,613
That's tough.

86
00:06:19,683 --> 00:06:21,538
That's... That's tough.

87
00:06:26,531 --> 00:06:30,939
Yeah, I guess Doris liked
all that he-man stuff.

88
00:06:31,043 --> 00:06:33,214
Sometimes I had the feeling that

89
00:06:33,315 --> 00:06:36,097
She and Big Dave were a lot closer
than they let on.

90
00:06:36,163 --> 00:06:38,684
The signs were all there,
plain enough.

91
00:06:48,387 --> 00:06:51,257
Not that I was gonna
prance about it, mind you.

92
00:06:51,363 --> 00:06:53,152
It's a free country.

93
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:56,161
Holdin' down the porch area, Ed?

94
00:06:57,507 --> 00:07:00,190
- That's some wife you got there.
- Yeah.

95
00:07:01,123 --> 00:07:02,978
She's a rare one.

96
00:07:05,155 --> 00:07:06,716
So, how's business,
Dave?

97
00:07:07,011 --> 00:07:09,694
Oh, uh, couldn't be better.

98
00:07:09,795 --> 00:07:12,610
These are boom times
in retailin', Ed.

99
00:07:12,675 --> 00:07:15,009
We're openin' another store
over there on carson,

100
00:07:15,107 --> 00:07:18,173
Big Dave's annex.
Now, this is strictly haberdashery.

101
00:07:18,275 --> 00:07:21,275
It's casual wear, pajamas,
ladies' undergarments and foundations,

102
00:07:21,379 --> 00:07:23,070
That type of thing.

103
00:07:24,963 --> 00:07:28,858
As a matter of fact,
I'm thinkin' of makin' Doris the comptroller.

104
00:07:32,835 --> 00:07:35,137
Listen, when the annex opens up,
you gotta stop by.

105
00:07:35,203 --> 00:07:37,178
Maybe we can update your suit
a little bit, huh?

106
00:07:41,603 --> 00:07:43,992
Course, you're in
the smock all day.

107
00:07:46,019 --> 00:07:48,091
Where do you get those things,
anyway?

108
00:07:48,163 --> 00:07:51,512
Specialty store
down in Sacramento.

109
00:08:02,307 --> 00:08:03,714
You tie your own flies.

110
00:08:03,971 --> 00:08:07,288
I mean, if you're really serious,
you tie your own flies.

111
00:08:07,395 --> 00:08:08,769
You do, uh...

112
00:08:08,867 --> 00:08:11,071
I know. It's meticulous.
I know.

113
00:08:11,171 --> 00:08:13,691
People say, hey, you can
buy flies at the store.

114
00:08:13,763 --> 00:08:16,796
The point is, there's a certain art
to the process.

115
00:08:16,899 --> 00:08:19,266
The point is not merely to provide.

116
00:08:19,363 --> 00:08:23,585
Let me point out, these fish are not
as dumb as you might think.

117
00:08:23,683 --> 00:08:25,625
Sure.
Go to the store.

118
00:08:25,731 --> 00:08:28,993
Describe to the man
where you will be fishing and for what,

119
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:33,826
And then you might as well have the man
sell you the goddamned fish, Ed.

120
00:08:33,923 --> 00:08:35,035
My point is,

121
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:38,041
This is a man who knows nothing,
no matter how much you tell him.

122
00:08:38,147 --> 00:08:40,830
- So sell him the goddamned fish, Ed.
- Yeah.

123
00:08:42,339 --> 00:08:43,322
Okay.

124
00:08:44,323 --> 00:08:46,210
Who gets the privilege?

125
00:08:46,307 --> 00:08:48,063
We're just closing, friend.

126
00:08:48,291 --> 00:08:49,982
Oh, happy days.

127
00:08:50,563 --> 00:08:53,825
I wish I was doing well enough
to turn away business.

128
00:08:53,923 --> 00:08:57,785
What's the problem, friend?
this is a business establishment with posted hours.

129
00:08:57,923 --> 00:08:59,516
More power to ya, brother.

130
00:08:59,619 --> 00:09:00,602
The public be damned.

131
00:09:00,771 --> 00:09:01,567
Hey...

132
00:09:01,667 --> 00:09:03,456
I'll take care of him.
you go ahead, Frank.

133
00:09:03,523 --> 00:09:05,465
Have a seat, mister.

134
00:09:05,571 --> 00:09:08,353
- You sure, Eddie?
- Yeah, yeah, go ahead.

135
00:09:11,331 --> 00:09:13,371
In your ear, mister.

136
00:09:15,427 --> 00:09:18,297
Oh, those fiery
Mediterraneans.

137
00:09:19,235 --> 00:09:22,333
Uh, say, uh,
not so fast there, brother.

138
00:09:24,835 --> 00:09:25,882
Pretty good, eh?

139
00:09:25,987 --> 00:09:27,809
Fools even the experts.

140
00:09:27,907 --> 00:09:31,256
One hundred percent human hair.
Handcrafted by Jacques

141
00:09:31,363 --> 00:09:32,890
Of San Francisco.

142
00:09:32,963 --> 00:09:36,062
I'd hate to have to tell you
what I paid for it.

143
00:09:36,163 --> 00:09:38,497
Yeah, it's a nice rug.

144
00:09:38,563 --> 00:09:40,418
I'm payin' it down
on the installment plan.

145
00:09:40,483 --> 00:09:44,313
A lot of folks live
with the pate exposed.

146
00:09:44,419 --> 00:09:46,753
They say the dames
think it's sexy,

147
00:09:46,851 --> 00:09:49,851
But for my money
it's just not good groomin'.

148
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:53,567
And groomin' my friend,
is probably the most important thing in business.

149
00:09:53,667 --> 00:09:56,001
After personality, of course.

150
00:09:56,963 --> 00:09:59,330
Creighton Tolliver.
Pleased to know ya.

151
00:10:00,387 --> 00:10:01,729
Ed Crane.

152
00:10:02,691 --> 00:10:04,992
So, what brings you
to Santa Rosa?

153
00:10:05,091 --> 00:10:08,157
A goose, my friend.
I was chasin' a wild goose.

154
00:10:09,827 --> 00:10:11,714
Ed, have you ever heard
of venture capital?

155
00:10:11,811 --> 00:10:14,178
Risk money.
very speculative.

156
00:10:14,243 --> 00:10:18,499
Except that in certain situations
it's not, see.

157
00:10:18,563 --> 00:10:20,603
I thought I had
a prospect here

158
00:10:20,707 --> 00:10:25,148
Well, I make the haul up...
And this lousy so-and-so tells me...

159
00:10:25,251 --> 00:10:27,040
That the situation has changed.

160
00:10:27,139 --> 00:10:30,488
All of his capital's tied up
in expansion plans of his own.

161
00:10:30,595 --> 00:10:33,213
Thank you mother.
Pop goes another bubble.

162
00:10:33,315 --> 00:10:36,064
It's only the biggest business opportunity
since Henry Ford,

163
00:10:36,163 --> 00:10:38,814
And I can't seem
to interest a soul.

164
00:10:38,883 --> 00:10:39,898
Is that right?

165
00:10:40,003 --> 00:10:41,913
It's called dry cleaning.

166
00:10:43,363 --> 00:10:45,883
You heard me right, brother.
dry cleaning.

167
00:10:45,987 --> 00:10:48,670
Wash without water.

168
00:10:48,771 --> 00:10:52,251
No suds. No tumple.
No stress on the clothes.

169
00:10:52,355 --> 00:10:55,005
It's all done
with chemicals, friend.

170
00:10:55,074 --> 00:10:56,765
And here's the capper...

171
00:10:56,867 --> 00:10:58,143
No shrinkage.

172
00:10:59,043 --> 00:11:00,766
That's right.

173
00:11:00,834 --> 00:11:02,045
Dry cleaning.

174
00:11:02,115 --> 00:11:05,148
All I need is $10,000
to open up the first store.

175
00:11:05,411 --> 00:11:09,819
Then I use its cash flow
to finance another, and so on,

176
00:11:09,923 --> 00:11:13,120
Leapfrog, bootstrap myself
to a whole chain.

177
00:11:14,083 --> 00:11:15,544
Well, me and a partner.

178
00:11:17,123 --> 00:11:19,359
Cleanliness, friend.

179
00:11:19,459 --> 00:11:21,401
There's money in it.
there's a future.

180
00:11:21,507 --> 00:11:23,132
There's room to grow.

181
00:11:23,203 --> 00:11:26,269
Say, that looks pretty good.

182
00:11:26,531 --> 00:11:28,603
Let's see it
with the hairpiece on.

183
00:11:40,323 --> 00:11:42,079
Dry cleaning.

184
00:11:43,555 --> 00:11:46,817
Was I crazy
to be thinking about it?

185
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:51,192
Was he a huckster or an opportunity,
the real Mccoy?

186
00:11:54,467 --> 00:11:58,591
My first instinct was
no, no, the whole idea was nuts.

187
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:02,302
But maybe that was the instinct
that kept me locked in the barber shop,

188
00:12:02,403 --> 00:12:06,080
Nose against the exit
afraid to try turning the knob.

189
00:12:06,978 --> 00:12:08,255
- Honey?
- Hmm?

190
00:12:09,699 --> 00:12:11,707
Shave my legs, will ya?

191
00:12:16,803 --> 00:12:18,908
What if I could
get the money?

192
00:12:49,379 --> 00:12:51,484
It was clean.

193
00:12:52,131 --> 00:12:53,887
No water.

194
00:12:55,074 --> 00:12:56,765
Chemicals.

195
00:13:00,771 --> 00:13:02,560
Gimme a drag.

196
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:16,156
Love ya, honey.

197
00:13:20,163 --> 00:13:21,723
What you...
uh, come in.

198
00:13:22,883 --> 00:13:25,850
Okay, yeah.
I'll see you tomorrow.

199
00:13:27,874 --> 00:13:29,565
Oh. I thought
you were the porter.

200
00:13:29,667 --> 00:13:31,576
Can I help ya?

201
00:13:31,683 --> 00:13:33,374
I'm Ed.

202
00:13:33,474 --> 00:13:35,384
Ed Crane.

203
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:39,578
Um, I cut your hair today.

204
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:42,332
I'm the barber.

205
00:13:42,435 --> 00:13:44,922
Jesus, yeah.
The barber.

206
00:13:45,027 --> 00:13:47,678
I didn't recognize you
without the smock.

207
00:13:47,778 --> 00:13:49,720
Did I leave somethin'
at the shop?

208
00:13:49,827 --> 00:13:52,129
No. No,
it's nothing like that.

209
00:13:52,226 --> 00:13:55,455
Um, l-I might be interested
in that business proposition.

210
00:13:58,499 --> 00:13:59,644
You got the dough?

211
00:13:59,715 --> 00:14:02,136
Well, I can get it.

212
00:14:02,243 --> 00:14:04,544
Come in. Come in!

213
00:14:04,643 --> 00:14:06,017
Sit down over there.

214
00:14:06,114 --> 00:14:08,383
- Coffee?
- No.

215
00:14:08,483 --> 00:14:11,614
Well, sit down,
make yourself comfortable.

216
00:14:13,315 --> 00:14:15,420
So tell me...

217
00:14:15,651 --> 00:14:20,026
Other than putting up the money, uh,
exactly what would you want the partner to, uh...

218
00:14:20,291 --> 00:14:21,720
Do?

219
00:14:21,795 --> 00:14:23,321
Hell, nothin'.

220
00:14:23,427 --> 00:14:27,518
You're gonna want to keep
tabs on your investment,
The running of the business,

221
00:14:27,586 --> 00:14:30,139
but I'm looking for a silent partner.

222
00:14:30,243 --> 00:14:33,177
I've done the research,
I've contacted the vendors.

223
00:14:33,283 --> 00:14:34,810
The deal is set.

224
00:14:34,914 --> 00:14:38,973
Disappear, if you'd like.
Check in whenever you want.

225
00:14:39,075 --> 00:14:42,424
I want the dough.
I don't take attendance.

226
00:14:42,531 --> 00:14:43,960
And how do we share the...

227
00:14:44,066 --> 00:14:46,238
Fifty-fifty,
straight down the line.

228
00:14:46,338 --> 00:14:48,443
You and me.
Finance and expertise.

229
00:14:49,443 --> 00:14:51,330
So you got the dough then,
do ya?

230
00:14:51,427 --> 00:14:53,434
I can have it in a week.

231
00:14:53,539 --> 00:14:55,546
The barber...

232
00:14:56,994 --> 00:15:00,311
Well, I thought this trip
was gonna be a bust.

233
00:15:00,579 --> 00:15:03,481
Just shows to go ya,
when one door slams shut,

234
00:15:03,555 --> 00:15:05,410
Another one opens.

235
00:15:05,475 --> 00:15:07,711
Here's to you, uh...

236
00:15:36,227 --> 00:15:37,753
Was that a pass?

237
00:15:39,011 --> 00:15:40,385
Maybe.

238
00:15:41,347 --> 00:15:43,038
Well, you're out of line, mister

239
00:15:44,867 --> 00:15:46,328
Not a problem.

240
00:15:46,435 --> 00:15:48,093
Way out of line.

241
00:15:48,194 --> 00:15:50,104
Right.

242
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:51,934
Strictly business.

243
00:15:54,498 --> 00:15:55,840
Okay.

244
00:16:06,307 --> 00:16:08,958
I sent it to Dave
the next morning.

245
00:16:09,058 --> 00:16:10,717
Then I waited.

246
00:16:30,434 --> 00:16:32,704
- Frank?
- Huh?

247
00:16:35,426 --> 00:16:37,215
This hair.

248
00:16:38,179 --> 00:16:39,935
Yeah?

249
00:16:40,034 --> 00:16:41,758
You ever wonder about it?

250
00:16:43,075 --> 00:16:44,481
What do you mean?

251
00:16:45,603 --> 00:16:47,675
I don't know.

252
00:16:47,746 --> 00:16:50,080
How it keeps on coming.

253
00:16:51,459 --> 00:16:54,361
It just keeps growing.

254
00:16:54,466 --> 00:16:56,735
Yeah.
Lucky for us, huh, pal?

255
00:16:56,835 --> 00:16:57,915
No, I mean,

256
00:16:59,266 --> 00:17:01,241
It keeps growing,

257
00:17:02,083 --> 00:17:03,938
And it's part of us.

258
00:17:05,634 --> 00:17:08,285
And then we cut it off
and throw it away.

259
00:17:09,378 --> 00:17:12,160
Come on, Eddie.
You're gonna scare the kid.

260
00:17:20,067 --> 00:17:21,976
Okay, bud, you're through.

261
00:17:35,779 --> 00:17:38,593
I'm gonna take this hair
and throw it out in the dirt.

262
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:40,512
What?

263
00:17:42,338 --> 00:17:45,186
I'm gonna mingle it
with common house dirt.

264
00:17:47,811 --> 00:17:50,462
What the hell
are you talking about?

265
00:17:53,571 --> 00:17:55,294
I don't know.
Skip it.

266
00:18:04,674 --> 00:18:06,529
Ed, gimme a zip.

267
00:18:06,626 --> 00:18:09,015
Where you going?

268
00:18:09,123 --> 00:18:13,116
Us. The party at Nirdlingers.
I told you last week.

269
00:18:13,219 --> 00:18:16,601
The Christmas push.

270
00:18:17,602 --> 00:18:19,358
Come on, get ready.

271
00:18:19,426 --> 00:18:20,670
It's important.

272
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:23,770
Nah, you go ahead.
I'm not big on parties.

273
00:18:23,874 --> 00:18:27,038
Oh, don't be a grump.
Gimme a zip.

274
00:18:55,267 --> 00:18:57,274
Hey, uh, ain't you
in ladies' wear?

275
00:18:58,978 --> 00:19:01,629
Huh? Haven't I seen you
up in ladies' wear?

276
00:19:01,731 --> 00:19:03,836
I don't work here.
My wife does

277
00:19:05,186 --> 00:19:06,877
Uh-huh. Whew.
That's some beat, huh?

278
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:08,440
Yeah.
Lucky for us, huh, pal?

279
00:19:08,547 --> 00:19:11,361
Check out the rack
on that broad in the angora.

280
00:19:12,354 --> 00:19:14,361
Ed, can I talk to you?

281
00:19:14,467 --> 00:19:15,514
Sure.

282
00:19:18,147 --> 00:19:19,161
Come in.

283
00:19:22,786 --> 00:19:24,859
Oh, sit down.

284
00:19:27,522 --> 00:19:29,791
Souvenired it off a jap
in New Guinea.

285
00:19:33,026 --> 00:19:36,823
Guess you're, uh, wonderin'
what Doris was so hot about.

286
00:19:42,147 --> 00:19:43,357
Havanas.

287
00:19:44,162 --> 00:19:46,050
My private stock.

288
00:19:47,426 --> 00:19:49,215
Romeo and Juliet.

289
00:20:07,298 --> 00:20:08,891
Ed, I...

290
00:20:13,346 --> 00:20:15,713
What is it, Dave?

291
00:20:19,874 --> 00:20:21,249
Ed, I've been weak.

292
00:20:21,346 --> 00:20:23,834
I've been weak.
The, uh...

293
00:20:25,826 --> 00:20:27,997
You're gonna burn yourself.

294
00:20:30,946 --> 00:20:32,124
Thanks.

295
00:20:32,227 --> 00:20:33,437
l, uh...

296
00:20:36,354 --> 00:20:37,816
Oh, Jesus.

297
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:43,352
I've been carryin' on
with a married woman.

298
00:20:45,442 --> 00:20:47,515
No one you know.

299
00:20:47,618 --> 00:20:50,040
And now the, uh,

300
00:20:50,146 --> 00:20:52,383
The chickens are
comin' home to roost.

301
00:20:53,154 --> 00:20:54,976
I got a note.

302
00:20:55,074 --> 00:20:56,961
A blackmail note, you know.

303
00:20:57,058 --> 00:20:59,131
Come across,
or everybody knows.

304
00:21:01,346 --> 00:21:03,997
I guess you know
what that would do to me.

305
00:21:07,714 --> 00:21:09,307
I guess that would be
pretty awkward.

306
00:21:09,411 --> 00:21:10,905
Awkward?

307
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:13,691
Yeah. Yeah.

308
00:21:13,794 --> 00:21:16,991
Ann would throw me
right out on my keister.

309
00:21:17,091 --> 00:21:20,157
I mean, it's her st...
It's her family's store, Ed.
It's her store.

310
00:21:20,227 --> 00:21:23,674
I serve at the indulgence
of the goddamn ownership.

311
00:21:25,314 --> 00:21:27,136
The lady's husband
would know.

312
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:34,774
- How much do they want, Dave?
- Ten thousand dollars.

313
00:21:34,883 --> 00:21:37,752
I don't know what to do, Ed.
I don't know what I can do.

314
00:21:39,171 --> 00:21:41,276
You know,

315
00:21:41,378 --> 00:21:43,549
I know who
the son of a bitch is.

316
00:21:46,466 --> 00:21:49,117
You know... who who is?

317
00:21:49,186 --> 00:21:50,713
The son of a bitch.
The blackmailer.

318
00:21:50,818 --> 00:21:52,673
I know who he is.

319
00:21:52,738 --> 00:21:55,585
It's no one you know.
It's a businessman from Sacramento.

320
00:21:55,682 --> 00:21:57,592
A goddamn pansy, Ed.

321
00:21:59,874 --> 00:22:02,744
Tryin' to rope me
into some crackpot scheme.

322
00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:05,596
I heard him out,
then I told him to go to hell.

323
00:22:05,666 --> 00:22:08,961
The very next day
the very next day I get a note,
the blackmail note,

324
00:22:09,026 --> 00:22:11,328
Asking me for the same amout of money
he asked me for.

325
00:22:11,426 --> 00:22:13,597
The very next day.
Ten thousand dollars.

326
00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:18,785
How did he know that
you were seein' the woman?

327
00:22:18,882 --> 00:22:21,784
He stayed at the hotel
that I went to with the, uh,

328
00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:25,086
lady in question.
He must've seen us.

329
00:22:26,338 --> 00:22:27,712
Oh, Jesus.

330
00:22:28,706 --> 00:22:32,001
I don't know what to do.
I don't know what to do.

331
00:22:39,874 --> 00:22:41,729
I don't know what to do.

332
00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:55,516
Why don't you just pay him. Dave?

333
00:22:55,586 --> 00:22:58,074
Cause that's my capitalization
on the annex.

334
00:22:58,146 --> 00:23:00,318
That's my operation.

335
00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:03,868
Christ almighty, Ed.

336
00:23:04,962 --> 00:23:07,810
That's what I just talkin'
to Doris about down there

337
00:23:07,906 --> 00:23:10,393
A way to get the money from the store
that we could hide from Ann.

338
00:23:12,162 --> 00:23:15,424
Doris, she was, she was pretty hot
about that, god bless her.

339
00:23:15,522 --> 00:23:18,108
Embezzlin', Ed.

340
00:23:18,211 --> 00:23:21,058
Embezzlin' from
my own goddamn wife.

341
00:23:25,922 --> 00:23:27,449
I'm sorry.

342
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:31,515
I'm sorry.

343
00:23:32,770 --> 00:23:34,558
It's okay.

344
00:23:45,443 --> 00:23:48,257
In a way,
I felt bad for Big Dave.

345
00:23:48,354 --> 00:23:52,413
I knew that ten grand was going to
pinch him where it hurt,

346
00:23:52,514 --> 00:23:54,303
But Doris was two-timing me

347
00:23:54,402 --> 00:23:57,271
And I guess somewhere
that pinched a little too.

348
00:24:49,506 --> 00:24:51,132
That was pretty.

349
00:24:53,506 --> 00:24:55,099
Did you make that up?

350
00:24:55,202 --> 00:24:57,112
Oh, no.

351
00:24:57,218 --> 00:24:59,771
No, that was written
by Ludwig Van Beethoven.

352
00:25:04,898 --> 00:25:07,069
Well, it was quite something.

353
00:25:07,298 --> 00:25:09,687
Yeah, he wrote some
beautiful piano sonatas.

354
00:25:09,794 --> 00:25:12,641
That was really something.

355
00:25:17,442 --> 00:25:18,849
I'm Ed Crane.

356
00:25:18,946 --> 00:25:20,768
I know who you are, Mr. Crane.

357
00:25:20,866 --> 00:25:24,063
My father used to take me with him
when he went to get his hair cut.

358
00:25:24,162 --> 00:25:25,307
Walter Abundas?

359
00:25:25,538 --> 00:25:27,873
Oh, yeah, sure.
Walter.

360
00:25:28,930 --> 00:25:30,872
Yeah, I'm Rachel Abundas.

361
00:25:30,978 --> 00:25:32,866
But everyone call me Birdy.

362
00:25:33,986 --> 00:25:36,124
I'm sorry.
I just didn't remember.

363
00:25:36,226 --> 00:25:37,306
Oh, no, it's okay.

364
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:42,145
You can't expect to remember
every skinny girl who comes in with her dad.

365
00:25:49,570 --> 00:25:51,839
So you don't, uh, like
that music out there?

366
00:25:51,938 --> 00:25:54,393
Not really.

367
00:25:54,498 --> 00:25:56,538
I'm not big on music, ordinarily.

368
00:25:57,538 --> 00:25:58,683
Ed.

369
00:26:10,914 --> 00:26:12,801
What a knucklehead.

370
00:26:13,634 --> 00:26:15,707
- Who?
- Dave.

371
00:26:17,058 --> 00:26:18,684
Why's that?

372
00:26:19,458 --> 00:26:20,865
Money problems.

373
00:26:20,962 --> 00:26:23,679
He's thinking about
canceling the annex.

374
00:26:24,514 --> 00:26:25,758
So?

375
00:26:26,722 --> 00:26:29,406
That means I don't run Nirdlingers.

376
00:26:34,850 --> 00:26:36,257
What a knucklehead.

377
00:26:41,858 --> 00:26:43,898
Big Dave did it, though.

378
00:26:49,218 --> 00:26:52,152
I sent a note telling him
where to drop the money.

379
00:26:54,050 --> 00:26:55,163
And he did.

380
00:26:55,266 --> 00:26:56,892
He came across.

381
00:27:34,338 --> 00:27:36,247
Yeah. Good!
How are ya?

382
00:27:36,353 --> 00:27:38,525
Come in.
I got everything organized.

383
00:27:38,625 --> 00:27:41,211
How you doin'?
You got a check?

384
00:27:41,314 --> 00:27:44,161
- Cash.
- Cash?

385
00:27:44,258 --> 00:27:47,040
Usually these kinds of things
are done with a bank draft,

386
00:27:47,138 --> 00:27:49,178
But cash, that's fine.

387
00:27:49,282 --> 00:27:51,224
It's all the same in the end.

388
00:27:52,802 --> 00:27:54,111
Dough is dough, huh?

389
00:27:55,874 --> 00:27:56,822
Whoa, nellie.

390
00:27:59,618 --> 00:28:01,374
I got the paperwork here.

391
00:28:01,474 --> 00:28:03,262
Partnership papers.

392
00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:05,021
They reflect our agreement.

393
00:28:05,122 --> 00:28:06,977
Fifty-fifty on the net.

394
00:28:07,073 --> 00:28:11,710
I provide professional services,
you provide the capital.

395
00:28:11,778 --> 00:28:15,073
I'm gonna give you a receipt
on the dough here.

396
00:28:15,170 --> 00:28:17,471
Uh, pretty straightforward.

397
00:28:17,538 --> 00:28:20,352
- I don't know whether you wanna show it to a lawyer
- No, that's okay.

398
00:28:20,417 --> 00:28:23,101
Yeah. Screw 'em, right?

399
00:28:23,202 --> 00:28:26,497
Pay them to tangle it up,
then you have to pay them to untangle them.

400
00:28:26,594 --> 00:28:28,503
What's the point?

401
00:28:28,578 --> 00:28:30,400
You just give me a second,

402
00:28:30,498 --> 00:28:33,116
I'll give you a receipt on the...

403
00:28:33,794 --> 00:28:34,841
Whoa, nellie.

404
00:28:36,162 --> 00:28:39,424
Okay, one thing
we didn't talk about was,

405
00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:42,305
I am thinking about,
uh, calling the place Tolliver's.

406
00:28:42,402 --> 00:28:43,995
After me, you know.

407
00:28:44,258 --> 00:28:48,120
I didn't think you were, uh,
much interested in, uh...

408
00:28:48,226 --> 00:28:51,488
- That's fine.
- Yeah, that's good. Good, good.

409
00:28:51,585 --> 00:28:54,934
Now, ready?
One second and I will...

410
00:28:55,042 --> 00:28:57,463
Okay, that's it.

411
00:28:59,138 --> 00:29:01,047
As per our discussion.

412
00:29:02,049 --> 00:29:03,708
All right, there it is,

413
00:29:03,810 --> 00:29:06,777
Writ large in legal escritoire.

414
00:29:06,882 --> 00:29:08,638
- And the, uh...
- Say, Creighton.

415
00:29:12,353 --> 00:29:14,142
You're not gonna screw me
on this.

416
00:29:16,066 --> 00:29:17,407
Screw you?

417
00:29:17,505 --> 00:29:18,814
Jesus.

418
00:29:20,514 --> 00:29:21,462
Take it to a lawyer.

419
00:29:21,730 --> 00:29:23,966
No, I insist!

420
00:29:24,066 --> 00:29:25,822
I insist!

421
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:29,884
This is dry cleaning.
This is not some fly-by-night thing here.

422
00:29:31,105 --> 00:29:32,534
Oh, I'll tell you,

423
00:29:32,642 --> 00:29:36,319
I have been 13 years as an entrepreneur,
and I have never...

424
00:29:36,418 --> 00:29:37,661
- It's okay.
- Nobody's ever questioned me...

425
00:29:37,762 --> 00:29:40,031
Hey, you want the dough back?

426
00:29:40,097 --> 00:29:42,105
Huh? Huh? Do you know
who you're talkin' to here?

427
00:29:42,178 --> 00:29:44,381
Do you know who I am?
Do you have any idea who...

428
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:45,759
It's okay.

429
00:29:47,073 --> 00:29:49,626
So, Tolliver's is okay, then?

430
00:29:53,122 --> 00:29:54,944
The next day was Saturday.

431
00:29:55,042 --> 00:29:57,726
We were going to a reception
for Doris's cousin Gina...

432
00:29:57,825 --> 00:30:00,760
Who just married a wop vendor
out near Modesto.

433
00:30:00,865 --> 00:30:03,254
Doris didn't much feel like going,
and I didn't either.

434
00:30:03,330 --> 00:30:07,324
But like she said,
we had a commitment.

435
00:30:09,282 --> 00:30:11,005
I hate wops.

436
00:30:14,242 --> 00:30:16,664
What's so goddamn strange
about that?

437
00:30:16,738 --> 00:30:18,047
I didn't say a word.

438
00:30:18,145 --> 00:30:20,251
You didn't have to
grow up with them.

439
00:30:22,210 --> 00:30:23,454
Family.

440
00:30:30,498 --> 00:30:33,018
Ed! Uncle Ed!

441
00:30:37,538 --> 00:30:41,019
He's riding Garibaldi!
Uncle Frankie's riding Garibaldi!

442
00:31:02,786 --> 00:31:04,793
That was when
she started drinking.

443
00:31:04,898 --> 00:31:05,661
Doris.

444
00:31:06,530 --> 00:31:07,326
Doris!

445
00:31:07,426 --> 00:31:09,368
You been okay?

446
00:31:09,473 --> 00:31:12,507
Mmm. Yeah.
How you doing, Costanza?

447
00:31:12,609 --> 00:31:15,708
Oh, you know.
Still got my health.

448
00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:18,042
And. Uh, how you been, uh...

449
00:31:19,170 --> 00:31:20,512
- Ed.
- Ed.

450
00:31:20,770 --> 00:31:23,104
He's a barber, right?

451
00:31:23,202 --> 00:31:26,682
It's a good trade.
So, how come you got no kids, huh?

452
00:31:26,786 --> 00:31:29,022
No, come on, kids!

453
00:31:29,089 --> 00:31:33,181
l-I just ate lunch!
I couldn't eat another thing.

454
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:35,224
Oh, n... Anthony!

455
00:31:35,330 --> 00:31:37,632
Anthony, it's you!

456
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:39,671
Okay, kids. Ready? And...

457
00:31:48,962 --> 00:31:53,020
Congratulations. Gina.
It's so goddamn wonderful.

458
00:31:53,089 --> 00:31:56,505
Life is just so goddamn wonderful,
You almost won't believe it.

459
00:31:56,610 --> 00:31:58,497
- It's just a bowl of goddamn cherries.
- Let' go.

460
00:31:58,593 --> 00:32:00,448
Sure.

461
00:32:03,266 --> 00:32:05,819
Congratulations on your goddamn cherries!

462
00:32:08,002 --> 00:32:09,758
Let go of my goddamn elbow!

463
00:32:21,218 --> 00:32:24,252
I never wanna see
another blueberry pie.

464
00:32:27,426 --> 00:32:30,525
I never even wanna hear those words.

465
00:32:33,953 --> 00:32:35,808
Don't say those words, Ed.

466
00:32:38,049 --> 00:32:39,991
Don't say those words.

467
00:33:27,202 --> 00:33:29,471
I'd met Doris blind
on a double date...

468
00:33:29,570 --> 00:33:32,985
With a loudmouthed buddy of mine
who was seeing a friend of hers from work.

469
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:37,024
We went to a movie.
Doris had a flask.

470
00:33:37,121 --> 00:33:39,226
Boy, she could put it away.

471
00:33:42,498 --> 00:33:46,753
At the end of the night,
she said she liked that I didn't talk much.

472
00:33:46,850 --> 00:33:49,784
It was only a couple weeks later
she suggested we get married.

473
00:33:58,530 --> 00:33:59,774
Yeah.

474
00:33:59,842 --> 00:34:03,617
Ed, it's Big Dave.
I gotta talk to you.

475
00:34:03,682 --> 00:34:05,176
What?

476
00:34:05,986 --> 00:34:07,295
Now?

477
00:34:08,193 --> 00:34:10,298
Yeah. It's important.

478
00:34:11,073 --> 00:34:12,797
But it-it's...

479
00:34:12,897 --> 00:34:14,719
Please, Ed.

480
00:34:16,065 --> 00:34:17,821
Your place?

481
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:19,799
I'm at the store.

482
00:34:19,905 --> 00:34:22,141
Let yourself in.

483
00:35:16,449 --> 00:35:17,562
Dave?

484
00:35:21,730 --> 00:35:23,256
I'm ruined.

485
00:35:26,913 --> 00:35:28,920
They've ruined me.

486
00:35:29,025 --> 00:35:30,814
This money.

487
00:35:31,938 --> 00:35:33,498
No annex.

488
00:35:34,433 --> 00:35:36,320
I'm all shot to hell.

489
00:35:38,210 --> 00:35:40,152
So, you paid the guy?

490
00:35:50,113 --> 00:35:51,968
What kind of man are you?

491
00:35:54,626 --> 00:35:56,665
What kind of man...

492
00:35:56,769 --> 00:35:58,176
Are you?

493
00:36:01,410 --> 00:36:04,377
I mean, I'd understand
if you came in here and...

494
00:36:04,482 --> 00:36:06,903
Socked me in the nose, whatever.

495
00:36:07,970 --> 00:36:09,758
I deserve it.

496
00:36:09,857 --> 00:36:12,312
I'm not proud of what I did.

497
00:36:13,793 --> 00:36:15,549
But you.

498
00:36:19,490 --> 00:36:20,766
Yeah, I paid up.

499
00:36:22,305 --> 00:36:24,094
As you well know.

500
00:36:25,825 --> 00:36:28,127
But then I went and
found the pansy.

501
00:36:34,146 --> 00:36:36,218
Oh, you got nothin' to say, huh?

502
00:36:36,322 --> 00:36:39,191
Well, you know the story.

503
00:36:40,002 --> 00:36:42,816
I didn't.

504
00:36:42,882 --> 00:36:45,435
I had to beat it
out of the pansy.

505
00:37:15,137 --> 00:37:16,959
I'm all shot to hell.

506
00:37:23,649 --> 00:37:25,308
Well, Dave, uh...

507
00:40:27,682 --> 00:40:31,326
It was only a couple weeks later
she suggested we get married.

508
00:40:35,105 --> 00:40:37,789
I said, "Don't you want
to get to know me more?"

509
00:40:37,890 --> 00:40:40,540
She said, "Why?
Does it get better?"

510
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:44,544
She looked at me
like I was a dope,

511
00:40:44,641 --> 00:40:47,162
Which I never
really minded from her.

512
00:40:47,265 --> 00:40:50,047
And she had a point,
I guess.

513
00:40:50,145 --> 00:40:53,244
We knew each other
as well then as now.

514
00:40:53,313 --> 00:40:55,734
Anyway, well enough.

515
00:41:08,417 --> 00:41:11,384
Holy, moley,
do I got a headache.

516
00:41:11,489 --> 00:41:14,042
- How are you today, Ed?
- Okay.

517
00:41:15,329 --> 00:41:17,850
- You don't got a headache?
- No.

518
00:41:18,977 --> 00:41:22,010
Damn, I got a headache
to beat the band.

519
00:41:26,145 --> 00:41:29,527
Did you pump it? You can't pump it.
That'll just flood it.

520
00:41:29,601 --> 00:41:34,303
No, no, no, you gotta pump it.
You can't just hold it down.
I mean that'll flood it.

521
00:41:34,401 --> 00:41:36,703
You crazy?
You pump it.

522
00:41:36,801 --> 00:41:39,071
You can't hold it down.

523
00:41:40,353 --> 00:41:43,200
- Just turn the key.
- Not when it's cold.

524
00:41:43,297 --> 00:41:45,239
Well, if it's cold, choke it.

525
00:41:45,345 --> 00:41:46,839
And pump it.

526
00:41:46,945 --> 00:41:48,254
How many time?

527
00:41:52,065 --> 00:41:53,821
Ed Crane?

528
00:41:57,281 --> 00:41:59,136
I'm Crane.

529
00:41:59,201 --> 00:42:01,656
- Come on outside.
- Sure.

530
00:42:16,897 --> 00:42:19,614
I'm officer Persky.
This is Krebs.

531
00:42:21,473 --> 00:42:23,163
Well, we goin'?

532
00:42:28,225 --> 00:42:29,207
Cigarette?

533
00:42:32,801 --> 00:42:33,913
Right.

534
00:42:35,809 --> 00:42:38,046
Pete's got some news for ya.

535
00:42:43,649 --> 00:42:44,991
Look, pal, um,

536
00:42:46,817 --> 00:42:48,639
It's a tough break, but, um,

537
00:42:50,337 --> 00:42:52,060
Well, damn it,
your wife's been pinched.

538
00:42:52,161 --> 00:42:55,030
They sent us around
to tell you.

539
00:42:56,801 --> 00:42:59,321
They sent us around to tell you.
We pulled the detail.

540
00:43:01,184 --> 00:43:03,421
My wife?

541
00:43:03,521 --> 00:43:06,685
Yeah, they brung her down
to county jail.

542
00:43:07,745 --> 00:43:08,890
Homicide.

543
00:43:08,961 --> 00:43:10,750
Well, embezzlement...

544
00:43:10,849 --> 00:43:12,376
And homicide.

545
00:43:12,481 --> 00:43:15,896
Guy named David Brewster.
He's the guy she...

546
00:43:16,001 --> 00:43:17,462
H-He's the decedent.

547
00:43:18,177 --> 00:43:19,770
I don't understand.

548
00:43:19,841 --> 00:43:21,302
He's the dead guy.

549
00:43:21,409 --> 00:43:25,020
Yeah, it's a tough break.

550
00:43:26,593 --> 00:43:28,666
Visiting ends at 5:00.

551
00:43:28,769 --> 00:43:30,842
Oh, uh, missed it today,
but, uh,

552
00:43:31,809 --> 00:43:33,532
You can go see her tomorrow.

553
00:43:35,233 --> 00:43:36,760
Sorry, pal.

554
00:43:36,833 --> 00:43:39,069
They sent us to tell ya.

555
00:43:40,801 --> 00:43:42,557
Crab detail.

556
00:44:05,217 --> 00:44:07,900
- Hello, Walter.
- Hello, Ed.

557
00:44:10,753 --> 00:44:13,623
Thanks.
Thanks for seein' me at home.

558
00:44:13,729 --> 00:44:16,413
Oh, hell.
Want a drink?

559
00:44:18,337 --> 00:44:19,286
Uh, no, thanks.

560
00:44:19,393 --> 00:44:21,532
You sure you don't need one?

561
00:44:21,633 --> 00:44:23,421
I'm fine.

562
00:44:24,545 --> 00:44:26,552
- Boy.
- Yeah.

563
00:44:27,969 --> 00:44:29,376
Jesus.

564
00:44:32,193 --> 00:44:34,047
So, uh,
What do l, uh...

565
00:44:34,145 --> 00:44:36,534
Of course, uh, l, uh...

566
00:44:37,249 --> 00:44:39,670
It's out of my league.

567
00:44:39,777 --> 00:44:43,933
No, I... no, l-I do probate
and real estate...

568
00:44:44,033 --> 00:44:45,277
And title search.

569
00:44:46,657 --> 00:44:50,202
I'd be absolutely worthless,
somethin' like this. Absolutely worthless.

570
00:44:52,513 --> 00:44:53,822
Excuse me.

571
00:44:55,297 --> 00:44:57,206
I just finished dinner.

572
00:45:00,832 --> 00:45:04,181
Frankly, Doris'd be better off
with the county defender.

573
00:45:04,449 --> 00:45:07,264
- He a good man?
- Bert's okay.

574
00:45:07,361 --> 00:45:09,881
Yeah, he...
he's a good man.

575
00:45:11,457 --> 00:45:14,326
Listen. I won't kid you, Ed.

576
00:45:14,433 --> 00:45:18,044
Uh, there's nobody around here
has any experience with this kind of thing.

577
00:45:19,233 --> 00:45:21,404
I hear they're bringing a prosecutor up.

578
00:45:21,473 --> 00:45:23,360
From, uh, Sacramento.

579
00:45:25,153 --> 00:45:28,666
It's a capital offense.
They're taking it seriously.

580
00:45:28,769 --> 00:45:30,657
- So...
- They're taking it seriously.

581
00:45:30,753 --> 00:45:32,989
So, what-what, uh...

582
00:45:33,249 --> 00:45:35,616
Do you want any more coffee, dad?
Oh, hi, Mr. Crane.

583
00:45:36,673 --> 00:45:38,134
Hello, Rachel.

584
00:45:40,385 --> 00:45:42,240
I was so sorry to hear.

585
00:45:43,873 --> 00:45:45,117
Yeah, thanks.

586
00:45:45,217 --> 00:45:47,322
- Coffee, Ed?
- No, thanks.

587
00:45:47,393 --> 00:45:50,011
- Ah, no, thanks, honey. We're...
- Okay, dad.

588
00:45:50,113 --> 00:45:52,087
It was good to see you again,
Mr. Crane.

589
00:45:56,064 --> 00:45:57,406
Damn.

590
00:45:58,625 --> 00:45:59,803
A good kid.

591
00:45:59,873 --> 00:46:01,280
Jesus...

592
00:46:06,305 --> 00:46:09,883
Who do you think?

593
00:46:09,952 --> 00:46:12,319
Lloyd Garroway in San Francisco.

594
00:46:12,992 --> 00:46:14,487
Probity.

595
00:46:14,593 --> 00:46:19,066
You know, nobody ever said anything iffy
about Lloyd Garroway.

596
00:46:20,001 --> 00:46:21,911
He's conservative.

597
00:46:22,177 --> 00:46:25,025
Jury might like that.
Might like that here.

598
00:46:27,232 --> 00:46:28,247
Probity.

599
00:46:28,352 --> 00:46:32,029
So, he's, uh,
the best man for...

600
00:46:32,129 --> 00:46:33,339
No.

601
00:46:33,441 --> 00:46:37,053
The best, the money-is-no-object best,

602
00:46:37,153 --> 00:46:40,568
any lawyer'll tell you,
is Freddy Riedenschneider from...

603
00:46:43,009 --> 00:46:44,569
Sacramento.

604
00:46:45,857 --> 00:46:48,475
I don't know
how you're fixed for money.

605
00:46:48,577 --> 00:46:50,399
- But he's...
- The best.

606
00:46:50,497 --> 00:46:51,904
The best, yeah.

607
00:46:54,433 --> 00:46:56,287
Riedenschneider.

608
00:47:04,993 --> 00:47:06,749
No question about it.

609
00:47:35,233 --> 00:47:36,280
Honey.

610
00:47:52,641 --> 00:47:54,463
I brought your makeup.

611
00:47:56,289 --> 00:47:57,401
Glasses.

612
00:48:04,289 --> 00:48:06,111
What happened to you?

613
00:48:06,209 --> 00:48:08,413
I don't know
what's goin' on... I...

614
00:48:11,872 --> 00:48:13,661
I don't know
what happened to Big Dave.

615
00:48:13,761 --> 00:48:15,517
I know some of it.

616
00:48:15,585 --> 00:48:18,716
Irregullarities in the books, they said.
Can I explain it?

617
00:48:19,808 --> 00:48:21,848
You don't have to
explain anything.

618
00:48:21,953 --> 00:48:24,735
I did help him cook the books, Ed.
I did do that.

619
00:48:31,297 --> 00:48:32,409
Should I...

620
00:48:34,145 --> 00:48:37,658
Should I tell you
why I changed the books?

621
00:48:40,801 --> 00:48:43,386
You don't have to
tell me anything.

622
00:48:44,737 --> 00:48:46,493
No, no, no!

623
00:48:47,777 --> 00:48:49,118
Jesus Christ!

624
00:49:03,457 --> 00:49:05,115
My books used to be perfect.

625
00:49:05,184 --> 00:49:08,599
Anyone could open 'em up
and make sense of the whole goddamn store.

626
00:49:13,057 --> 00:49:14,944
I knew we'd pay for it.

627
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:16,535
I don't care what it costs!

628
00:49:16,641 --> 00:49:19,870
This is when you come together.

629
00:49:19,969 --> 00:49:21,430
Well, that's awfully
generous of you, Frank.

630
00:49:21,697 --> 00:49:24,599
The hell with it.
The hell with it, Eddie.

631
00:49:24,705 --> 00:49:26,527
This is when you come together.

632
00:49:26,625 --> 00:49:28,479
This is family.

633
00:49:31,777 --> 00:49:34,875
They're just people
like you and me, Ed.

634
00:49:35,137 --> 00:49:36,566
Remember that.

635
00:49:38,113 --> 00:49:39,968
Just people.

636
00:49:40,065 --> 00:49:44,255
They gotta put up the big front
so that people will trust 'em with their money.

637
00:49:44,352 --> 00:49:46,687
This is why the big lobby, Ed.

638
00:49:46,785 --> 00:49:51,422
But they put their pants on
one leg at a time just like you and me.

639
00:49:53,088 --> 00:49:56,536
They, too, use the toilet, Ed,
in spite of appearances.

640
00:49:56,641 --> 00:49:59,575
And their money will be secured
by the barber shop.

641
00:49:59,681 --> 00:50:02,550
A rock.
A rock, the barber shop.

642
00:50:02,657 --> 00:50:04,380
Mr. Raffo.

643
00:50:04,481 --> 00:50:06,106
Yes, sir?

644
00:50:06,209 --> 00:50:08,118
Could you come with me,
please?

645
00:50:08,225 --> 00:50:10,265
Sure.
Can Ed come too?

646
00:50:10,368 --> 00:50:11,775
Mister...

647
00:50:12,353 --> 00:50:15,135
Crane.
Ed Crane.

648
00:50:15,233 --> 00:50:17,982
You also have an interest
in the securing porperty?

649
00:50:19,393 --> 00:50:20,953
He's a barber.

650
00:50:21,024 --> 00:50:24,439
- Second chair.
- Not an owner.

651
00:50:24,545 --> 00:50:28,320
No, he's, uh, family.
He's my brother-in-law.

652
00:50:28,416 --> 00:50:31,515
It would be best
if he waited here.

653
00:51:07,904 --> 00:51:09,660
The barber shop.

654
00:51:13,505 --> 00:51:17,334
Doris and Frank's father had worked
30 years to own it free and clear.

655
00:51:17,441 --> 00:51:21,303
Now it got signed over to the bank,
and the bank signed some over to Frank.

656
00:51:21,408 --> 00:51:24,704
And Frank signed the money
to Freddy Riedenschneider.

657
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:26,840
Who got into town
two days later...

658
00:51:26,945 --> 00:51:29,694
And told me to meet him
at Da Vinci's for lunch.

659
00:51:32,289 --> 00:51:34,710
Not fried, poached.
Three of 'em for two minutes.

660
00:51:34,817 --> 00:51:37,686
Strip steak, medium rare,
flapjacks, potatoes, tomato juice...

661
00:51:37,792 --> 00:51:39,069
And plenty of hot coffee.

662
00:51:40,064 --> 00:51:42,552
- You have any Prairie Oysters?
- No, sir.

663
00:51:42,624 --> 00:51:45,658
Then bring me a fruit cocktail
while I wait.

664
00:51:47,969 --> 00:51:49,911
- You're Crane?
- Yeah.

665
00:51:50,016 --> 00:51:51,511
Barber, right?

666
00:51:51,616 --> 00:51:53,405
I'm Freddy Riedenschneider.
Hungry?

667
00:51:53,504 --> 00:51:54,715
Uh, not really.

668
00:51:54,785 --> 00:51:57,502
They tell me the chow's okay here.
I made some inquiries.

669
00:51:58,912 --> 00:52:01,880
Look, I don't want to waste your time,
so I'll eat while we talk.

670
00:52:02,017 --> 00:52:03,097
Do you mind?
You don't mind.

671
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:05,950
While I'm in town
I'm staying at the Hotel Metropole.

672
00:52:06,016 --> 00:52:09,846
Turandot Suite. Yeah, it's goofy.
They named their suites after operas.

673
00:52:09,952 --> 00:52:11,807
Room's okay, though.
I poked around.

674
00:52:11,905 --> 00:52:14,174
I'm having 'em hold it for me.
I'll be back and forth.

675
00:52:14,272 --> 00:52:17,568
So, in addition to my retainer,
you're paying hotel,

676
00:52:17,665 --> 00:52:19,323
Living expenses, secretarial,

677
00:52:19,424 --> 00:52:22,523
Private eye, if we need to make inquiries,
head shrinker, should we go that way.

678
00:52:22,625 --> 00:52:24,665
We'll talk about appeals
if, as and when.

679
00:52:24,768 --> 00:52:28,314
- For now, has she confessed?
- No, of course not. She didn't do it.

680
00:52:28,385 --> 00:52:31,767
Good. That helps. Not that she didn't do it
That she didn't confess.

681
00:52:31,873 --> 00:52:35,615
Course, There's ways to deal with a confession,
but that's one less thing to think about.

682
00:52:35,713 --> 00:52:38,647
Now, interview. I'm seeing her tomorrow.
You sholud be there 3:00.

683
00:52:38,752 --> 00:52:40,891
One more thing.
you keep your mouth shut.

684
00:52:40,992 --> 00:52:43,643
I get the lay of the land,
I tell you what to say.

685
00:52:43,745 --> 00:52:46,876
No talking out of school.
What's out of school?
Everything's out of school.

686
00:52:46,944 --> 00:52:49,399
I do the talking.
You keep your trap shut.

687
00:52:49,505 --> 00:52:51,479
I'm an attorney. You're a barber.
You don't know anything.

688
00:52:54,464 --> 00:52:55,358
Okay.

689
00:52:55,424 --> 00:52:57,791
Good. Any questions,
give me a ring.

690
00:52:57,889 --> 00:53:00,125
Turandot suite.
If I'm out, leave a message.

691
00:53:01,281 --> 00:53:04,096
Sure you don't want anything?
No? Okay.

692
00:53:04,192 --> 00:53:06,080
You're okay, pal.

693
00:53:06,337 --> 00:53:08,573
You're okay, she's okay,
everything's gonna be hunky...

694
00:53:08,672 --> 00:53:10,614
And the...
and the flapjacks, honey.

695
00:53:17,536 --> 00:53:18,911
There they were,

696
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:23,899
All going about their business.

697
00:53:25,985 --> 00:53:27,872
It seem like I knew a secret,

698
00:53:27,936 --> 00:53:31,285
A bigger one, even,
than what had really happened to Big Dave,

699
00:53:31,393 --> 00:53:34,142
Something none of them knew.

700
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:36,629
Like I had made it to the outside somehow,

701
00:53:36,736 --> 00:53:39,257
And they were all still struggling
way down below.

702
00:54:01,792 --> 00:54:02,937
Ann.

703
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:05,469
Hello, Ed.

704
00:54:06,305 --> 00:54:08,443
Would you like to come in, Ann?

705
00:54:09,952 --> 00:54:12,319
No. No, it's very late.

706
00:54:16,224 --> 00:54:18,712
I'm so sorry about your loss.

707
00:54:23,841 --> 00:54:27,899
Course you know that Doris
had nothing to do with it.

708
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,040
Nothing at all.

709
00:54:30,496 --> 00:54:32,285
I know.

710
00:54:33,089 --> 00:54:35,227
Don't worry, Ed.

711
00:54:36,096 --> 00:54:37,984
I came to tell you...

712
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:41,342
And you should tell Doris...

713
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:42,367
Yeah?

714
00:54:52,993 --> 00:54:56,702
You know how Big Dave loved camping
and the out of doors?

715
00:54:58,976 --> 00:55:00,023
Yeah.

716
00:55:00,128 --> 00:55:04,056
We went camping last summer
in Eugene, Oregon.

717
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:07,607
Outside Eugene, Ed.

718
00:55:09,536 --> 00:55:10,518
Yeah?

719
00:55:10,624 --> 00:55:14,235
At night there were lights.
We both saw them.

720
00:55:14,336 --> 00:55:18,165
We never told anyone
outside of our official report,

721
00:55:18,272 --> 00:55:20,127
Our report to the government.

722
00:55:22,176 --> 00:55:23,867
There was a spacecraft.

723
00:55:24,896 --> 00:55:26,903
I saw the creatures.

724
00:55:27,008 --> 00:55:29,823
They led Big Dave onto the craft.

725
00:55:29,919 --> 00:55:33,215
He never told anyone
what they did.

726
00:55:33,312 --> 00:55:34,838
Ann, would you like to...

727
00:55:34,944 --> 00:55:39,319
I cannot repeat it to you,
but this thing goes deep, Ed.

728
00:55:39,424 --> 00:55:42,141
It goes deep
and involves the government.

729
00:55:42,208 --> 00:55:46,234
This was not your wife.
There's a great deal of fear.

730
00:55:46,335 --> 00:55:50,110
You know how certain circles
would-would find it,

731
00:55:50,208 --> 00:55:51,190
The knowledge, a threat.

732
00:55:51,296 --> 00:55:53,597
They-they try to limit it, and...

733
00:55:53,696 --> 00:55:57,438
Ann, would you like to come in,

734
00:55:57,536 --> 00:56:00,122
Sit down?

735
00:56:00,224 --> 00:56:02,134
Maybe have a drink.

736
00:56:06,848 --> 00:56:09,466
Sometimes knowledge
is a curse, Ed.

737
00:56:11,295 --> 00:56:13,881
After this happened,

738
00:56:13,984 --> 00:56:15,260
Things changed.

739
00:56:17,663 --> 00:56:18,743
Big Dave...

740
00:56:22,784 --> 00:56:25,151
He never touched me again.

741
00:56:27,968 --> 00:56:29,495
Tell Doris not to worry.

742
00:56:29,568 --> 00:56:32,088
I know it wasn't her.

743
00:56:33,088 --> 00:56:34,778
Perhaps this will
bring it out

744
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:36,374
Finally.

745
00:56:36,608 --> 00:56:40,121
Perhaps now
it will all come out.

746
00:57:08,512 --> 00:57:09,973
It stinks.

747
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:11,800
But it's true.

748
00:57:11,904 --> 00:57:14,140
I don't care it's true, it's not true.
It stinks.

749
00:57:14,207 --> 00:57:16,695
You say he was being blackmailed?
By who? You don't know.

750
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:19,164
For having an affair.
With who? You don't know.

751
00:57:19,263 --> 00:57:22,711
Did anyone else know about it?
Probably not. You don't know.

752
00:57:22,816 --> 00:57:24,790
I knew about it.

753
00:57:24,896 --> 00:57:26,871
Big Dave told me about it...

754
00:57:26,976 --> 00:57:29,659
And the spot he was putting himself in
by getting the money.

755
00:57:29,728 --> 00:57:32,957
Terrific! Your husband backs you up.
That's terrific.
