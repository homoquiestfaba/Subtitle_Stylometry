00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,756
(Thud)

3
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:42,236
(Bell tolls)

4
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,712
- Anyone noticed?
- You are blessed with luck, Tomas.

5
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,791
Gregory, life is for living.

6
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,076
Your hair is still wet.

7
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:45,789
- (Whispers) Who is our visitor?
- (Whispers) Father Michael.

8
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:48,838
He has brought something
for the repository.

9
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,554
- Hurry up, say amen.
- This cannot be good.

10
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,835
- What?
- Whatever you are doing here.

11
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,434
Trust me, Gregory, this is good.

12
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:27,035
(Gregory) Where are you taking me?

13
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,111
(Tomas) The repository.

14
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,636
Oh, and you expect
to use my key? Forget it.

15
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,280
- Too late.
- Oh, Tomas.

16
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,598
(Gregory) We should not be here.
That key was entrusted to me.

17
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,750
Go back to the room if you like.

18
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:57,308
l have always wanted to know
what is kept here.

19
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:01,109
- Some things are better left a mystery.
- Look at all this.

20
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:05,159
This monastery was built
to protect the contents of this room.

21
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,435
l want to know why.

22
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:19,195
The Wheel of Time.

23
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,036
What is it?

24
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,438
l've heard stories of it
but never believed it to be real.

25
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,391
lt is rumoured to be
a means of transport through time.

26
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,710
How?

27
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:47,117
- The lights are burning.
- Brother Rafael was here.

28
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:51,034
- He must have left them so.
- lndeed.

29
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,592
Father, is something wrong?

30
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,276
We thought of burying it.

31
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,510
Or throwing it in the sea.

32
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,876
But evil...

33
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,793
has a way of returning.

34
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,955
Written by St Nicodemus of Alexandria
in 1260.

35
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,156
A scholar and warrior.

36
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,636
Munkar and Nakir.

37
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:04,113
Described as ravening lions
to the soul and body of the world.

38
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:07,909
Father Michael, l understand
the gravity of this burden.

39
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,073
l have devoted my life to being
the guardian of these artefacts.

40
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,196
Guardian of evil.

41
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:19,716
l see now why the Order of Damascus
is an offence to Rome.

42
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,837
The Holy Father is aware
of the importance of our work

43
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,718
which is why he sent you
and your charge to us.

44
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:32,189
And l can promise you that
everyone here is as serious as l am

45
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,396
about keeping these secrets...

46
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,392
safe.

47
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,389
Now can we please get out of here?

48
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:07,512
Tomas, did you hear nothing
Father Michael said?

49
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,875
Whatever lies in that box is evil.

50
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:24,236
The real evil is keeping such a beautiful
work of art locked in a chest.

51
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,312
(Gregory) Chest.

52
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,870
- This sculptor was quite talented.
- Put it back in the chest.

53
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:38,155
Quickly! You must put it back.

54
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:42,749
Gregory, if you wanted to touch it,
all you had to do was ask.

55
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,673
- Oh. Oh.
- Gregory, what are you doing?

56
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,552
(Gregory) Oh!

57
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:51,029
- What is that?
- Get it off me! Get it off!

58
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,712
Get it off!

59
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,675
- Get it off!
- Get off of him!

60
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,671
Get off of him!

61
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,910
(Agonized scream)

62
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,636
(Squelching)

63
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,470
(Whimpering) Tomas, help!

64
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:41,035
Ah! Ah.

65
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,951
(Laboured breathing)

66
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:49,597
- (Sizzling)
- (Agonized shouting)

67
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,875
May the Lord have mercy on us all.

68
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,071
(Gregory moaning)

69
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,152
- Tomas, go back to the monastery.
- What were they?

70
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:50,235
Demons, succubi.

71
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,193
Foul things from before the time of man.

72
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,589
And now they are free.

73
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,636
Unleashed.

74
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:05,196
Moving through time toward a world
that is ill-prepared for their evil.

75
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,872
Gregory...

76
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:11,794
He will die if you do not get help.
Hurry! Time is short!

77
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,119
- Father.
- Time is short.

78
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:37,193
(Munkar) Come, sister.
There is much to do.

79
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:40,670
Let us see what this new age
has to offer.

80
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:47,310
(Man) Why don't we just take a trip...
(Woman) Yeah.

81
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,435
(Man) Should be pretty good...

82
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:51,953
(Woman) Whoa!
(Man) What?

83
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,996
(Car horn)

84
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,396
(Man) Woo!

85
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:13,430
(Abbot) Have you thought about
what you leave? About Gregory?

86
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:17,308
- He has the Order, he has you.
- He needs his brother.

87
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,516
His real brother.

88
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,798
What happened last night was proof of
something l've known for some time.

89
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:26,155
This place is not right for me.

90
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,959
l've watched you two
since you were children.

91
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:34,194
Gregory has always followed our ways,
always been ready to do the Lord's work.

92
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:39,117
And l have always been trouble.

93
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,839
Yes, l suppose that is true.

94
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,388
But you have a strength, Tomas.

95
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,596
lt runs deeper than you know.

96
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:50,036
You still have a part to play
in God's plan.

97
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:56,875
l am more concerned
with my own plans right now.

98
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,156
l understand.

99
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,471
You know there will always be
a place here for you

100
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:06,120
if and when you decide to return.

101
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,310
Thank you, Father.

102
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,550
Your hand. What happened to it?

103
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:15,554
- lt is a blister.
- Let me see it.

104
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,076
lt is nothing.

105
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:21,116
Let me see your hand.

106
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,709
You have been marked.

107
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:30,509
- lt is a burn, nothing more.
- That is not true, Brother Tomas.

108
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,751
God has chosen you to wield
the dagger of St Nicodemus.

109
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,956
But l have never fought in my life.

110
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:40,238
You must travel on the Wheel of Time,
find Munkar and Nakir.

111
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,276
Find them and destroy them.

112
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:47,229
Father Michael, l will travel south
to the ocean and the sun.

113
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:51,472
No Munkar, no Nakir, no Wheel of Time.

114
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:54,279
Tomas, God has chosen you.

115
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,269
Then He has chosen wrong.

116
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:29,316
Tomas!

117
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:34,274
- Tomas.
- Rafael, what is it?

118
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:37,193
Your brother Gregory - he's dying.

119
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:58,479
Oramus te, Domine,

120
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,516
per merita Sanctorum tuorum

121
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,116
quorum reliquiae hic sunt

122
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,195
et omnium Sanctorum,

123
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,510
ut indulgere digneris

124
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,556
omnia peccata mea.

125
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,916
Amen.

126
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:52,550
(Father Michael) This dagger was forged
by St Nicodemus to battle the demons.

127
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:58,351
He believed that Munkar and Nakir
had destroyed entire cities.

128
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:02,479
This dagger is the only thing
that can stop them.

129
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:06,439
lt has tasted of their blood
and will lead you to them.

130
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,917
The world as we know it
will be changed, Tomas.

131
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,833
lt will be filled
with many new strange things.

132
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:34,071
But remember,
God's children do not change.

133
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,833
They will help you on your journey.

134
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:39,718
When you find the demons,
strike quickly.

135
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,955
You may not get a second chance.

136
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,236
God be with you, my son.

137
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,348
And also with you, Father.

138
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:58,396
(Car horn)

139
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,876
(Helicopter)

140
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,711
(Walkman)

141
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:16,360
(Mobile phone)

142
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,836
(Siren)

143
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,196
Thank you, my brother.

144
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:46,750
Oh, damn! My bad, bro,
l wasn't watching. You all right?

145
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,476
l-l do not know.

146
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:52,552
Yeah, you don't look so hot. You sick?

147
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:56,474
Do you know where you are?
What day it is? Your name?

148
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:58,516
What's your name, man?

149
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:01,273
- My name is Tomas.
- Tomas.

150
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,954
OK. Look, we should get you
to a hospital.

151
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:06,759
No, l'm fine. My stomach.

152
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,796
Stomach, yeah.

153
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:14,270
Can l do anything for you?
Give you a lift somewhere?

154
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:17,432
- A lift?
- A ride home? Something?

155
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,988
A ride, yes, please.

156
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,520
You got it.

157
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:27,355
Which way you heading?

158
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,556
Hey, where you going, man?

159
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,556
That way.

160
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,876
(Squelching)

161
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,276
(Gurgling)

162
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,756
Ah!

163
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,796
Oh.

164
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:33,874
(Male TV presenter) 'This bracelet is
beautiful, you can't get better than this.

165
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:38,192
'ln fact, as always,
your satisfaction is guaranteed!

166
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:40,475
'There's nothing else to say.'

167
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,949
(Purrs)

168
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:46,508
Satisfaction

169
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,556
guaranteed.

170
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:53,394
(Female TV presenter) '..sold seven
in the last 20 seconds...'

171
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,630
Turn off that noise box.

172
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,590
lt's ruining my appetite.

173
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:03,548
Munkar,

174
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:08,077
the noise box and its pictures

175
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:11,550
will teach us how to behave
in this new time.

176
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:19,790
(Woman) 'There is no risk to you.'
(Man) 'That's right!'

177
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:23,919
No risk...to you.

178
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,075
(Man) 'Your satisfaction is guaranteed.

179
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,836
'Satisfaction guaranteed.'

180
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,719
Satisfaction guaranteed.

181
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:41,153
(Woman) 'There is no risk to you.'
(Man) 'That's right.'

182
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,196
Absolutely

183
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,070
no risk

184
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,796
to you.

185
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,836
(Laughs)

186
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,036
(Gurgling)

187
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:17,954
- This all right?
- The world has truly changed.

188
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:20,474
ls this the part of town you want to go?

189
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,676
There are better places to stay.

190
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:28,554
l have a task to complete
and then l'll be going home.

191
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,596
So where's home?

192
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:34,070
A long journey away.

193
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:36,911
(Distant voices)

194
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,632
Oh, dear Lord!

195
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:43,756
Drop the weapon! Drop it!

196
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,916
(Crying)

197
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,995
- Hey.
- Hey, you.

198
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,753
(Sighs)

199
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:35,559
- You OK?
- Yeah.

200
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,835
Found this.

201
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:41,515
lt's funny the stuff you find
when you're not expecting it.

202
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:44,717
Dad gave it to me
the day l graduated from the academy.

203
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:47,314
- He was a good man.
- Yeah, he was.

204
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:50,790
- He'd be proud of you, Rach.
- l hope that's true.

205
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,235
Trust me, he would be.

206
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:55,276
l miss him.

207
00:23:55,360 --> 00:24:00,639
Me too. That's why l like to spend time
with you. You're a lot like him.

208
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:05,311
- lt goes both ways.
- You take it one day at a time.

209
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:08,437
Wake up in the morning,
breathe in and out, do your job.

210
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:12,115
Yeah. lt's just the cross.
lt caught me off guard, is all.

211
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:16,675
- You ready for breakfast?
- Yeah. What's on the menu?

212
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:19,069
Homicide, Gastown.

213
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:21,116
(Siren)

214
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:28,229
- (Flies buzzing)
- Oh, God!

215
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,880
There's something you don't
see every day.

216
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,435
(Officer) The victim is Greg Summers.

217
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,276
White male, aged 38.

218
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:45,791
Found a wallet, some pictures.
Probably married.

219
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,996
Came up here for a little fun.

220
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,435
- Who found him?
- Housekeeper.

221
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:54,149
She's downstairs, in shock.
Had the front desk call us.

222
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,196
Do something about the smell?

223
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:58,236
How long's he been here? A month?

224
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:01,790
- ME says not even an hour.
- What?

225
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:04,792
Victim was seen coming up here
with two hookers.

226
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,077
- Where are they?
- Trying to find them right now.

227
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:10,116
We do have another suspect.

228
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,752
- Tomas Alcala?
- Yes.

229
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:15,559
l'm Detective Dressler.
This is Detective Rand.

230
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:18,757
l give my solemn word,
l did not harm that man.

231
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:20,990
- Your solemn word?
- Yes.

232
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:26,636
Mr Alcala, l understand that you've
waived your right to an attorney?

233
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:29,917
- Yes.
- You know everything you say and do

234
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:32,838
may be used against you
in a court of law?

235
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:35,878
Everything l say and do
will be judged by God.

236
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,076
Fine.

237
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:43,711
Then maybe you can tell us
what you were doing in that hotel room.

238
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:46,598
l was looking for two women.

239
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,511
Two hookers?

240
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:51,273
- Hookers?
- Prostitutes.

241
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:54,275
Two prostitutes were seen going in...

242
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:56,954
No, they are succubi.

243
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,712
ln English, please.

244
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:02,793
A succubus is a demon that feeds
on the life force of men.

245
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,276
Why were you looking for them?

246
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:09,830
They are ravening lions
to the soul and body of the world.

247
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:14,630
These ravening lions,
why didn't you stop the ravening lions?

248
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,676
l arrived too late.

249
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:20,274
They had fed on the man and escaped.

250
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:26,512
(Dressler) Do you know
where they went?

251
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:33,071
You. Yes, it is you.

252
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,150
l saw you find it.

253
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,595
- What?
- The cross.

254
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:45,111
The golden cross your father gave you.
You found it.

255
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,760
Don't change the subject, Alcala.

256
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,400
You miss him deeply.

257
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:54,477
When you found the cross
it made you cry.

258
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:57,676
l saw you cry.

259
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:14,108
- You take over.
- Rach.

260
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:18,116
Rach.

261
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,910
OK, granted, that was pretty weird,

262
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,356
given the fact you found
it today but it's a coincidence.

263
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:32,557
You can't let the loonies know
they're getting to you.

264
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,835
- Who is he?
- A nobody, a drifter.

265
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:38,515
- All we know is he's a suspect.
- Did we run prints on him?

266
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:41,876
Prints gave us nada, no lD,
no social security number.

267
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:44,872
As far as the world's concerned,
he doesn't exist.

268
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,156
What's taking her?

269
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,670
She will be out soon.

270
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,716
She bathes for you.

271
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:19,754
All right. But l did pay for the two of you
so two is what l expect.

272
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:22,479
Know what l'm saying?

273
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:28,396
Your satisfaction...

274
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:32,394
is guaranteed.

275
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:37,720
l like the sound of that.

276
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:46,074
So what's the deal with you guys?

277
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:48,469
Are you a lesbian couple or what?

278
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:53,757
l like that. l like it.

279
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:02,277
So who's the top? You or her?

280
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,995
She is.

281
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:45,633
So if you're innocent,

282
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,874
tell me what you were doing with this.

283
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,474
l was using it to find Munkar and Nakir.

284
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:58,069
l'm assuming those are the prostitutes.

285
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:00,549
Succubi.

286
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:06,955
How's this knife
supposed to help you find them?

287
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:09,076
The blade is drawn to them and...

288
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:14,075
lt will point in their direction.

289
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:20,712
- Spin it.
- Spin it?

290
00:30:56,520 --> 00:31:00,479
There. That direction.
That is where you will find them.

291
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,629
All right, that was a pretty good trick.

292
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,716
- Ow.
- (Squeaking)

293
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,712
What the...?

294
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,670
(Screams)

295
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:17,320
Get it off me!

296
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:22,598
Give me your hand!

297
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,955
Get it off me!

298
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,951
Hold still!

299
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,631
(Creature shrieking)

300
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,791
- Sick son of a bitch!
- Let him go!

301
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:45,111
- lf you hurt her, l'll...
- lt wasn't him.

302
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:50,717
- What happened?
- l don't know. This thing bit me.

303
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:53,473
- A maggot. l don't know what it was.
- Where?

304
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:55,551
There.

305
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:57,596
He stepped on it.

306
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:00,516
Let me see your hand, Rachel.

307
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:04,592
l don't understand.
lt was, it was right there.

308
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:07,114
lt was right there.

309
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:24,748
Be careful, Munkar.

310
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:27,229
Do not drink so deeply.

311
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:35,474
l have fed from more men
than you can imagine, sister.

312
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:38,233
l know when the heart blood comes.

313
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:45,479
(Door bangs, car alarm)

314
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:47,596
What is that?

315
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:49,671
l do not know.

316
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,350
The priest. He has the dagger!

317
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,231
(Growls)

318
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,719
Not a priest, nor a saint.

319
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:17,315
Just a monk, a monk
who's very far from home.

320
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:21,313
(Sniffs) Mm. Familiar.

321
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:24,073
l drank of your brother, did l not?

322
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:26,720
l will stop you! l will stop you!

323
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,791
How will you do that, little one?

324
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:33,715
That dagger must be wielded by a saint
in order to be of any harm to us.

325
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:35,836
You are no saint.

326
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:38,036
l can smell sin on you.

327
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,196
(Siren approaching)

328
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:19,398
(Dressler) l don't think he did it.
(Rand) Look at all the evidence.

329
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:22,950
The guy escapes,
two hours later we get a burglar alarm.

330
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:27,238
What do we find? A new victim.
And he leaves his calling card.

331
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:32,872
He says the knife led him
to this Munkar and Nakir.

332
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:36,509
- Maybe he caught them in the act.
- That's crazy talk, OK?

333
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:40,832
You need a break, a leave of absence.
Whatever you wanna call it, take it.

334
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:42,876
l don't need a break, l'm fine.

335
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,520
We should go after the women,
not Alcala.

336
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:49,593
Wanna tell me about that imaginary bite
on your wrist?

337
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:51,636
l know what l saw.

338
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:55,189
l don't wanna talk about this any more.

339
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:59,956
Morgan, the knife's clean, there's no
trace of blood from any of the victims.

340
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:03,316
lt's not the murder weapon,
he's just taunting us with it.

341
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:06,392
- Why do you want to crucify him?
- l don't have time

342
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:10,712
for stories about dog-sized maggots
and demonic hookers.

343
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:28,039
You have rested long enough, Nakir.

344
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:31,875
Leave me.

345
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:34,155
l am weary.

346
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:36,037
You fed, you...

347
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,880
cannot be...

348
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,390
Filthy, repulsive slut!

349
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:53,189
Wrapping your legs around every slab
of human flesh you bring home.

350
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,510
l warned you but you did not take heed.

351
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,750
l know why you are weary -

352
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:00,308
because you are with child.

353
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:04,597
(Screeches)
Do not presume to judge me.

354
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:07,035
Without my efforts we would never feed.

355
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:10,908
Hold your tongue, sister,
or l will hold it for you.

356
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,877
(Both shrieking)

357
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:15,196
(Growling)

358
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,356
(Coughing)

359
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,398
(Screeching)

360
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,876
(Coughing)

361
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:05,477
(Screeching)

362
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:17,232
Be still. Little one, be still, be still.

363
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:22,395
Understand you are my sister.

364
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:26,474
l am trying to protect you.

365
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:29,316
You lie.

366
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:33,439
- l can smell the stink of your jealousy.
- No.

367
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:35,590
l speak the truth.

368
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:39,719
Nakir, our brood are born ravenous.

369
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:43,475
They will kill and consume us
if not given other food.

370
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:48,918
This world is filled with bags of food,
all walking around, making noise.

371
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,833
Your youth is your folly.

372
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:54,036
And it will be your undoing.

373
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:58,196
lt was you who allowed Nicodemus
to imprison us.

374
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,116
We are both guilty

375
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:06,316
of indiscretions.

376
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:14,758
- Now l hunger.
- Come.

377
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:17,115
Let us find you some sustenance.

378
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:20,556
Why go further than the nest?
We can feed on the priest.

379
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:24,189
Not yet. The monk is special.

380
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:26,475
He is meant to be savoured.

381
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:29,830
We will save him for later.

382
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,594
l do not know why You chose me.

383
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,833
l'm failing You, Lord. l'm failing You.

384
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:31,276
Our Father,

385
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:35,239
who art in Heaven,
hallowed be Thy name.

386
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:38,278
- Excuse me.
- Yes, ma'am, how can l help you?

387
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:42,956
Get that man off the boardwalk.
lt's supposed to be a family place.

388
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,275
Don't worry, l'll get right on it.

389
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,836
Give us this day our daily bread.

390
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:52,956
Forgive us our trespasses...

391
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:55,031
All right, pal.

392
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:56,997
What the...?

393
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:59,196
What are you covered in?

394
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:02,036
(Rattling)

395
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:10,235
l want to control the wheel.

396
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:13,039
- Oh, you wanna drive, huh?
- Yes.

397
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:17,159
Tell you what - why don't you slide
on over here and sit on my lap?

398
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:20,596
We'll take it
for a simulated test drive.

399
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:25,072
Huh. Yeah.

400
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:28,479
Oh yeah. Now, that's more like it, huh?

401
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:35,314
Your friend's kinda quiet back there.

402
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:39,678
- She likes to watch.
- (Horn beeps)

403
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:42,232
Well.

404
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:46,074
Put your hands up on the wheel
and put one foot on the gas.

405
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:48,993
l'll be your seat belt. Here we go.

406
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:51,913
(Makes engine noises)

407
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,195
(Man laughs)

408
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,838
(Growls savagely)

409
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:01,238
Why must you always spoil
my enjoyment of the food?

410
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:05,108
- He was growing tiresome.
- That's what made him enjoyable.

411
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:13,676
Mm. Mm.

412
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:39,074
- What have you got?
- A station wagon.

413
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:42,550
Witnesses saw two women get out
and head into the store.

414
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:45,359
- Sound like your suspects?
- Sure does.

415
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:47,795
Wait, we're not set up to cover you yet.

416
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:36,113
- Rachel!
- (Growling)

417
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:40,034
lt isn't polite to interrupt people
while they are eating.

418
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:45,156
- Put her down...
- (Growling)

419
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:48,755
Ugh. Ah.

420
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:50,910
Hello, lover.

421
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,956
(Laughs)

422
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:54,917
(Gasping)

423
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,036
(Gunshot)

424
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:22,919
Hateful wench, you dare threaten me?

425
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,877
Get her away from him.

426
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:26,678
Aah!

427
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:29,115
Nakir!

428
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:31,634
Release it.

429
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:38,433
lf you so much as spill
one drop of Munkar's blood...

430
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:44,316
l will kill him.

431
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:46,470
Let him go.

432
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:48,357
Not yet.

433
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:50,795
Not while his life still has worth.

434
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:54,831
You take one more step with that dagger

435
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:59,391
and my sister will rip him
from groin to guts.

436
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:08,712
(Sirens, police radio)

437
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:11,109
Go, go, go! Where are they?

438
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:16,550
Morgan! Morgan!

439
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:19,157
Morgan.

440
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:22,676
You OK?

441
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:27,196
Just got the wind knocked out of me.

442
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:28,952
You saw me shoot that woman.

443
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:33,795
- l don't know what l saw, it was crazy.
- l'm telling you, they're not human.

444
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:36,599
Maybe they're hopped up on PCP.

445
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:40,389
That might explain it.
But they're our primary suspects,

446
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:43,119
- not Alcala.
- They're all suspects.

447
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:47,239
Guys, another unit brought in
that guy, the one who skipped on us.

448
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:49,515
- Tomas Alcala?
- That's him.

449
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:53,878
Couple of officers picked him up
at Playland. ls he still a suspect?

450
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:56,155
(Dressler) No.
(Rand) Yes.

451
00:44:57,360 --> 00:45:00,432
He's asking to speak to
Detective Dressler.

452
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:03,236
Rachel.

453
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:05,515
He's still a suspect.

454
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:08,558
- Detective Dressler.
- (Man shouting) Get it off me!

455
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:10,915
Are you all right?

456
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:15,349
Can you stop them?

457
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:18,637
- l pray to God...
- Screw that. Can you stop them?

458
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:23,156
- l need the dagger.
- That's not a problem.

459
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:25,196
Then you must set me free.

460
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:29,956
Let him out.

461
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:32,680
(Guard) We thought he was a suspect.

462
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:35,194
(Dressler) No, he's not
a suspect any more.

463
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:50,990
Put your hands behind your back
like you're handcuffed.

464
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:53,833
- Like this?
- Yeah. Just keep them like that.

465
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:00,469
Get in here.

466
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:04,117
(Phone)

467
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:08,109
(Woman) There's a call here for you.

468
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:11,116
Come on.

469
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:21,516
(lndistinct police radio)

470
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:26,469
l'm sticking my neck out for you.

471
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:29,916
- Don't let me down.
- l'll do my best, l promise.

472
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:38,876
That Dressler woman may cause us
problems - she has found the dagger.

473
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:41,713
She is no more saint than our little priest.

474
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:46,590
Remember Nicodemus? ln the wrong
hands that dagger could seal our fate.

475
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:51,158
My appetite has been aroused
by that police.

476
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:53,356
Pity l could not feast on him.

477
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:57,433
ln time, we will feed on the monk,
regain our strength,

478
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:59,909
then we will find this Dressler woman.

479
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:08,471
- Where is he?
- Detective Dressler took him out.

480
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:11,120
- What?
- l'm sorry. She said you knew.

481
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:16,156
You better have a damn good reason.

482
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:20,313
- l need you to trust me on this.
- Are you nuts? He's a suspect.

483
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:24,712
- l'll have him back in the morning.
- You'll have him back in ten minutes.

484
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:28,076
l know what l'm doing.
You're gonna have to trust me.

485
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:31,038
This is not about trust, Rachel.

486
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:33,350
Morgan.

487
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:36,238
- What do you want?
- l want you to keep my back

488
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:38,436
just until l can get some answers.

489
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:41,512
OK. But l want him in that cell
tomorrow morning.

490
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:43,875
Don't make me come looking for you.

491
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:55,990
Find him. We must find him!

492
00:47:58,520 --> 00:48:01,796
- ls this where you live?
- Temporarily.

493
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:06,431
OK, l found these.
They might be a little big on you

494
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:09,398
but at least they're clean
and not covered with...

495
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:11,835
- Demon secretion.
- Yeah.

496
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:14,388
Like l said, they're clean.

497
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:52,149
(Tomas) That is where you were
when you found the cross.

498
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:54,515
OK.

499
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:56,750
So how do you know that?

500
00:48:57,840 --> 00:49:02,356
The Wheel of Time showed me.
lt showed me all of this.

501
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:07,473
- Come again?
- The Wheel of Time.

502
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:10,715
lt is how l came to be here.

503
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:14,713
l have been sent from the year 1815
to stop Munkar and Nakir.

504
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:17,756
Uh-huh.

505
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:21,957
l realise that is difficult to believe.

506
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:25,794
lf you'd said that yesterday
l would've thought you were nuts.

507
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:28,394
Now l'm not so sure.

508
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:30,914
Does that mean you believe me?

509
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:34,959
l don't know what l believe any more.
Giant maggots, magic knives,

510
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:36,917
bulletproof hookers.

511
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:41,592
So does that mean you believe me?

512
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:47,755
l don't know why but...

513
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:50,836
yeah, l do.

514
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:55,036
The Dressler woman -
once we find her we'll find the monk.

515
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:57,395
How do we find her?

516
00:49:57,480 --> 00:49:59,789
She is a police, like him.

517
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,150
Afternoon, ladies.

518
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:08,390
What can l do for you?

519
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:11,870
My sister would like to take a ride
in that machine

520
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:14,474
but she is afraid.

521
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:18,075
Will you take a ride with us?

522
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:20,435
l can't, really.

523
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:22,715
l'm on duty.

524
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:26,793
Do you think you could
make an exception?

525
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:35,433
The police has touched the priest.
l can taste it on him.

526
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:38,635
(Munkar) Where is the monk, police?

527
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:40,870
(Laboured) l don't know any monk.

528
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:45,750
(Nakir) The man you touched, the one
who was covered in our secretion.

529
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:48,274
Yeah. The vagrant guy.

530
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:50,510
Yeah. The mother complained.

531
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:56,234
l took him...to the station...

532
00:50:57,120 --> 00:50:59,759
Fifth Precinct.

533
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:03,276
(Nakir) You are...you're sweet.

534
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:06,999
Mm. Sweet!

535
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:10,716
(Slurping)

536
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:16,276
(Nakir) Thank you.

537
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:22,034
Welcome to the Fifth Precinct, ladies.

538
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:24,236
How may l help you?

539
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:31,191
(Tomas) This is a miracle.
An entire library in a small box.

540
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:34,192
Can you find information
on St Nicodemus?

541
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:37,590
- Who's that?
- The saint who forged the dagger.

542
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:41,229
- He originally imprisoned the demons.
- Let's see.

543
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:45,195
This is such an age of wonders.

544
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:49,068
So why did you leave?
Volunteer or were you recruited?

545
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:53,630
l made a very bad mistake.

546
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:57,275
One that can never be taken back.

547
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:01,474
l set them free.

548
00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:04,074
Munkar and Nakir.

549
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:06,799
l am responsible for the blood they shed.

550
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:11,795
By the way, you were right.

551
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:15,195
What you said about my father.

552
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:17,430
And l do miss him.

553
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:19,556
Very much.

554
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:23,511
He gave me this a month before he died.

555
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:28,712
l was a rookie, l got lazy
and did a bad search

556
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:31,598
and l let the suspect go.

557
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:36,196
He thought it would be funny to rob
the house of the cop who arrested him.

558
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:38,396
My dad was here.

559
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:42,795
l guess they were both surprised
to see each other.

560
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:44,950
My dad was shot four times.

561
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:49,596
You could not have known.

562
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:53,753
Four times.
Where do you get absolution for that?

563
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,036
From God.

564
00:52:57,120 --> 00:52:59,156
Thanks, l don't believe in Him.

565
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:02,670
Your cross?

566
00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:08,714
l don't wear it. l just keep it
because it reminds me of my father.

567
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:32,678
Looks like St Nicodemus wrote a book.

568
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:34,955
Nothing about the dagger though.

569
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:38,396
Father Michael said
only the dagger could stop them.

570
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:41,517
However, when the demons saw me
they laughed.

571
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:46,355
The dagger must be wielded by a saint
to be effective, and l am not a saint.

572
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:50,399
- So what do we do now?
- We must find a saint.

573
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:53,233
- Tell us where she is.
- We will not harm her.

574
00:53:55,720 --> 00:54:00,111
We only want the dagger,
and the man she has in her care.

575
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:02,270
No risk to you.

576
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:05,989
- What man?
- The little monk.

577
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:11,518
We know she took him from this place
and you know where she is.

578
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:13,670
You're gonna have to kill me.

579
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:15,352
(Both) Oh.

580
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:17,829
- We will.
- (Both laughing)

581
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:21,799
But only after you've told us
where Dressler is.

582
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:23,996
(Screaming)

583
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:34,470
- What's the name of your order again?
- The Order of Damascus.

584
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:38,515
- There it is.
- Your monastery

585
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:41,956
is now a hospice
run by a Sister Stephen.

586
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:43,792
Who is that?

587
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:47,350
Sister Stephen, Patricia Stephen.

588
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:50,034
Looks like a Mother Teresa type.

589
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:53,271
Cares for people
with long-term illnesses.

590
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:56,830
Newspapers are calling her a saint.

591
00:54:56,920 --> 00:54:59,036
l knew we would find a saint.

592
00:54:59,120 --> 00:55:02,635
She can wield the dagger.
This is all part of God's plan.

593
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:06,193
- Where are you going?
- To the monastery.

594
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:09,829
l'm sure she's gone for the night.
Wait till morning.

595
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:34,155
l saw you looking at me.

596
00:56:35,080 --> 00:56:37,275
l am sorry.

597
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:40,079
No, it's OK.

598
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:43,350
l liked it.

599
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:51,753
We're both so alone.

600
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:55,995
Please, l cannot.

601
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:03,796
Oh.

602
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:09,030
Come now, little priest,

603
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:13,238
do not pretend
that you're not enjoying my touch.

604
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:18,794
- You repulse me.
- One would not know that

605
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:20,711
from your actions.

606
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:24,395
You seemed to be
quite accepting of Nakir's affections

607
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:26,550
a moment ago.

608
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:31,270
Please, l cannot.

609
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:35,269
- (Ecstatic moan)
- Oh, God.

610
00:57:35,360 --> 00:57:38,238
- Please, no.
- You're almost there, Tomas.

611
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:42,839
Soon you will know
the warmth of our embrace.

612
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:45,354
Almost there, Tomas.

613
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:48,436
You're almost there.

614
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:50,476
Lord, take this burden away from me!

615
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:52,630
Ah!

616
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:16,196
(Creaking)

617
00:58:17,120 --> 00:58:19,156
Alcala?

618
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:32,076
You awake?

619
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:38,796
Morning.

620
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:41,314
What are you doing over here?

621
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:44,472
l tried sleeping
in the place you set for me

622
00:58:44,560 --> 00:58:46,835
but l am more accustomed to this.

623
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:51,357
- l'm sorry if l frightened you.
- No, it's fine. Sleep where you want.

624
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:54,193
Did you hear anything in here?

625
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:58,792
(Crashing)

626
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:07,516
l'm sorry, Rachel.

627
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:14,470
They made me lead them here.

628
00:59:28,680 --> 00:59:30,398
(Mocking screeches)

629
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:38,956
Neither of you learn very quickly,
do you?

630
00:59:40,040 --> 00:59:42,395
Stop. Stop it!

631
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:43,833
You're killing him.

632
00:59:44,680 --> 00:59:47,956
Yes. lsn't it exquisite?

633
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:56,598
Sister.

634
00:59:56,680 --> 00:59:59,240
Do not drink so deeply.

635
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:10,555
Do it.

636
01:00:12,760 --> 01:00:14,193
Please.

637
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:21,031
No!

638
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:23,791
Munkar!

639
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:29,030
Munkar.

640
01:00:29,120 --> 01:00:31,315
Come on. Come on.

641
01:00:36,520 --> 01:00:39,751
How do l save you?
Tell me what to do.

642
01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:41,910
(Sobbing)

643
01:00:57,040 --> 01:00:59,429
(Tomas) At times like this
our faith is tested.

644
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:02,671
- Spare me the sermon.
- God's will works through us.

645
01:01:02,760 --> 01:01:06,878
God's will? You think it was His will
that l shot my partner?

646
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:09,030
What kind of God is that?

647
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:12,872
lt is not for us to know His purpose.

648
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:15,633
But know that He has a will,
take comfort in that.

649
01:01:15,720 --> 01:01:18,314
l can't. lt doesn't bring Morgan back.

650
01:01:19,120 --> 01:01:21,680
He has gone on to a better place.

651
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:24,558
Am l supposed to take solace in that?

652
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:28,428
Everyone that l've ever cared about
has been taken from me.

653
01:01:28,520 --> 01:01:32,798
lt doesn't matter if he's in a better place
because l'm still here.

654
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:35,678
Yes, because God has work
for you to do.

655
01:01:36,920 --> 01:01:39,992
What if l'm not interested
in doing His work?

656
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:44,077
Then l will tell you l know how you feel.

657
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:47,311
And the demons,
they took my brother from me.

658
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:50,840
l understand your pain and your loss.

659
01:01:51,720 --> 01:01:53,790
But you must understand this -

660
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:55,916
if we fail at this task

661
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:59,754
their offspring will grow in number
and destroy the earth.

662
01:01:59,840 --> 01:02:04,152
Now, we must get the dagger
to Saint Patricia.

663
01:02:17,480 --> 01:02:21,268
Look, about back there and before,

664
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:24,956
l was a little rough on you.

665
01:02:26,520 --> 01:02:28,988
l know you were only trying to help.

666
01:02:30,600 --> 01:02:32,670
Loss is painful.

667
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:36,234
Yeah.

668
01:02:36,320 --> 01:02:38,436
Sorry, Alcala.

669
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:43,075
Please, call me Tomas.

670
01:02:44,080 --> 01:02:46,230
Rachel.

671
01:02:46,320 --> 01:02:48,276
Rachel?

672
01:02:49,720 --> 01:02:51,915
That is a beautiful name.

673
01:02:57,680 --> 01:02:59,033
(Crash)

674
01:03:00,040 --> 01:03:02,395
- Go! Drive! Go!
- Hold on.

675
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:05,750
(Tyres screeching)

676
01:03:19,160 --> 01:03:21,355
Are you girls all right?

677
01:03:32,040 --> 01:03:34,190
Tomas and Rachel?

678
01:03:34,280 --> 01:03:37,238
Yes. You must be Sister Stephen.

679
01:03:37,320 --> 01:03:42,189
Oh, please, call me Patricia, or Patty.
We don't stand on ceremony, here.

680
01:03:42,280 --> 01:03:44,510
Thank you very much for seeing us.

681
01:03:44,600 --> 01:03:49,230
Pleased to meet you. Forgive me for
being rude, but you do not wear a habit.

682
01:03:49,320 --> 01:03:51,959
A lot of people are frightened by it.

683
01:03:52,040 --> 01:03:54,156
By a nun's clothing? Why?

684
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:57,516
l blame the movies.
Would you like to come up?

685
01:04:00,440 --> 01:04:02,749
(Sighs)

686
01:04:02,840 --> 01:04:06,799
- Well, it's quite a story.
- Sister Stephen...

687
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:09,678
Patricia, l know how it sounds

688
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:13,196
and if l hadn't seen
these things first-hand myself

689
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:15,396
l wouldn't believe it either.

690
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:17,675
lt's not a question of believing you,

691
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:20,797
it's more a question
of saintly credentials.

692
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:22,950
Unfortunately l'm not a saint.

693
01:04:24,440 --> 01:04:26,795
But you must be.

694
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:32,228
- Sorry for the misunderstanding.
- Wait.

695
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:35,430
Sister, please,

696
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:37,590
you are my last hope.

697
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:41,155
l'm sorry, Mr Alcala.

698
01:04:41,240 --> 01:04:43,390
l wish l could help.

699
01:05:06,720 --> 01:05:09,280
(Patricia) Mr Alcala, is something wrong?

700
01:05:11,560 --> 01:05:13,710
This is where my brother died.

701
01:05:15,960 --> 01:05:18,269
l have failed him.

702
01:05:18,360 --> 01:05:20,476
l have failed them all.

703
01:06:41,600 --> 01:06:43,352
(Distant screaming)

704
01:06:56,280 --> 01:06:58,236
(Rasping scream)

705
01:06:58,960 --> 01:07:01,190
(Agonised screams)

706
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:09,559
Look, sister - l have found sustenance
for your newborn.

707
01:07:09,640 --> 01:07:12,154
No! No!

708
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:14,993
No! No! No!

709
01:07:16,720 --> 01:07:18,676
No! Aah!

710
01:07:28,800 --> 01:07:30,836
Oh! Ah!

711
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:39,636
Oh!

712
01:07:39,720 --> 01:07:42,154
Oh! Oh, Munkar,

713
01:07:42,240 --> 01:07:44,356
something is wrong.

714
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:55,589
Help me.

715
01:07:57,280 --> 01:07:58,474
Aah!

716
01:07:58,560 --> 01:08:01,870
(Crunching, crackling)

717
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:08,073
(Screaming) Help me!

718
01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:11,277
Help me!

719
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:20,916
No! No!

720
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:46,950
(Cawing)

721
01:08:50,520 --> 01:08:52,909
Why do you protect her?

722
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,594
She was to be food for my child.

723
01:08:55,680 --> 01:08:59,229
l warned you about allowing
the seed into your body.

724
01:09:00,520 --> 01:09:06,072
- Munkar, do not forsake me.
- l have not forsaken you.

725
01:09:06,160 --> 01:09:08,390
Our existence is made up of phases.

726
01:09:08,480 --> 01:09:11,916
You have surpassed me
and moved on to the next phase.

727
01:09:14,120 --> 01:09:16,076
l envy you.

728
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:19,633
(Creature screeching)

729
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:22,632
No!

730
01:09:22,720 --> 01:09:24,676
Wait!

731
01:09:24,760 --> 01:09:26,955
- (Squeaking)
- Munkar!

732
01:09:27,040 --> 01:09:29,554
Yes, sister, l envy you.

733
01:09:29,640 --> 01:09:31,949
But you are of no use to me any more.

734
01:09:32,040 --> 01:09:33,917
(Cries)

735
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:37,754
l need a partner who can lure prey.

736
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:41,355
You, Nakir, are spent.

737
01:09:43,320 --> 01:09:45,356
Treacherous bitch!

738
01:09:48,040 --> 01:09:50,156
Miserable, faithless whore!

739
01:09:50,240 --> 01:09:52,196
(Screaming)

740
01:09:57,680 --> 01:09:59,716
Do not worry.

741
01:09:59,800 --> 01:10:01,870
You will do better, sister.

742
01:10:03,680 --> 01:10:06,513
There is absolutely no risk to you.

743
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:08,750
- (Laughs)
- (Screams)

744
01:10:13,480 --> 01:10:16,278
You said the Order of Damascus
sent you here

745
01:10:16,360 --> 01:10:19,591
with a dagger of some sort
to use against the demons.

746
01:10:19,680 --> 01:10:21,716
May l see it?

747
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:31,590
Father Michael said l was the chosen one
because the dagger marked me.

748
01:10:33,040 --> 01:10:35,156
lt certainly seems that way.

749
01:10:35,240 --> 01:10:38,232
But l am not worthy,
l cannot wield the dagger.

750
01:10:38,320 --> 01:10:41,392
- l don't see why not.
- Because l am not a saint.

751
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:49,190
Mr Alcala, if saints knew what they were,
they would not be saints.

752
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:03,796
Be still, sister.

753
01:11:03,880 --> 01:11:07,270
You will need all your strength
for the transformation.

754
01:11:08,280 --> 01:11:12,319
- Thank you again for listening.
- Like l said, it's quite a story.

755
01:11:12,400 --> 01:11:15,437
- You think l'm crazy.
- On the contrary.

756
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:18,273
l wish l had as much faith as you.

757
01:11:20,160 --> 01:11:23,038
- God be with you.
- And with you, Tomas.

758
01:11:23,120 --> 01:11:27,591
lf you see Rachel, will you please tell her
l've gone to the repository?

759
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:32,718
l pray you find what you're looking for.

760
01:11:41,200 --> 01:11:43,668
(Munkar) Do not fear, little sister.

761
01:11:43,760 --> 01:11:45,876
l will care for you.

762
01:11:45,960 --> 01:11:49,077
Ah! l'm not your sister.

763
01:11:50,040 --> 01:11:54,192
(Munkar) Soon you will not remember
this phase of your evolution.

764
01:11:54,280 --> 01:11:56,840
The pain will only last a moment.

765
01:11:56,920 --> 01:12:01,357
Then it is like falling into a blissful sleep.

766
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:04,956
(Growls)

767
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:09,272
When you wake, we will go find
your little monk

768
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:12,272
and you can feast on him.

769
01:12:12,360 --> 01:12:15,909
You will not need to find me.
l will not hide from you.

770
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:27,956
(Nakir groaning)

771
01:12:30,120 --> 01:12:32,076
(Creature squeaking)

772
01:13:00,160 --> 01:13:02,958
You're getting better
with that dagger, little monk.

773
01:13:03,040 --> 01:13:06,794
But you still are not a saint
and l do not fear you.

774
01:13:08,840 --> 01:13:11,638
Why don't you just
surrender yourself to me?

775
01:13:11,720 --> 01:13:15,269
l will give you pleasures
you never even dared dream of.

776
01:13:15,360 --> 01:13:19,956
You killed my brother. The only
pleasure you can give me is your death.

777
01:13:26,600 --> 01:13:29,512
Poor little misguided man.

778
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,468
l will savour your death.

779
01:13:42,240 --> 01:13:44,959
Filthy brood.

780
01:14:21,120 --> 01:14:24,032
- Come on.
- No.

781
01:14:24,120 --> 01:14:26,076
(Dressler) We're getting out of here.

782
01:14:26,160 --> 01:14:29,994
- The Lord has given me a task.
- Let them kill each other.

783
01:14:30,080 --> 01:14:32,548
- Life is for living!
- l used to feel that way

784
01:14:32,640 --> 01:14:35,791
but the Lord gave me this life
and now l give it back to Him.

785
01:14:35,880 --> 01:14:37,757
Tomas, you're not a saint.

786
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:41,071
lf saints knew what they were,
they would not be saints.

787
01:15:09,280 --> 01:15:11,396
- Where is Munkar?
- l don't know.

788
01:15:11,480 --> 01:15:14,119
Please help me. The blade is stuck.

789
01:15:55,040 --> 01:15:57,349
l thought you weren't a saint.

790
01:15:59,080 --> 01:16:01,355
l am not.

791
01:16:01,440 --> 01:16:04,000
Guess that's not your decision to make.

792
01:16:05,680 --> 01:16:07,910
Perhaps it was you.

793
01:16:25,960 --> 01:16:29,430
So what are you going to do? Bury it?

794
01:16:30,280 --> 01:16:32,840
No. That has been tried.

795
01:16:32,920 --> 01:16:35,195
Evil has a way of returning.

796
01:16:35,280 --> 01:16:37,919
l must get it back
to the Order of Damascus.

797
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,719
How do you plan
on getting back to them?

798
01:16:42,360 --> 01:16:46,353
- l do not know.
- Come on. Let's get you out of here.

799
01:16:46,440 --> 01:16:49,750
Sister Stephen!
We need to get him to a hospital.

800
01:16:49,840 --> 01:16:52,559
l can do better than that. Follow me.

801
01:17:20,360 --> 01:17:22,316
The Wheel of Time.

802
01:17:22,400 --> 01:17:26,757
Many years ago the church sent
a cardinal to take all of the artefacts.

803
01:17:26,840 --> 01:17:30,469
l hid this one.
At the time l couldn't have told you why.

804
01:17:30,560 --> 01:17:34,314
Just had a feeling it still had
a part to play in God's plan.

805
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:36,994
God be with you, Tomas.

806
01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:47,876
l have to go.

807
01:17:47,960 --> 01:17:50,076
l want you to stay.

808
01:17:51,320 --> 01:17:54,710
l have to get these back.
They must be kept safe.

809
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:56,756
Tomas, please.

810
01:17:56,840 --> 01:17:59,593
Munkar has poisoned me.

811
01:17:59,680 --> 01:18:01,796
Can they help you there?

812
01:18:02,680 --> 01:18:05,638
- They can pray for me.
- So can l.

813
01:18:17,840 --> 01:18:19,876
Wear it.

814
01:18:58,360 --> 01:19:00,396
Oh, my son.

815
01:19:00,480 --> 01:19:03,153
Oh, my dear boy.

816
01:19:03,240 --> 01:19:05,879
Father, have l redeemed myself?

817
01:19:05,960 --> 01:19:08,315
A hundred times over, Tomas.

818
01:19:11,040 --> 01:19:13,156
(Whispers)

819
01:19:13,240 --> 01:19:16,630
l could not hear you, my son.
What do you say?

820
01:19:17,960 --> 01:19:19,916
(Whispers)

821
01:19:28,640 --> 01:19:32,394
- Thank you, sister.
- Tomas has gone home, hasn't he?

822
01:19:32,480 --> 01:19:35,472
- Yes.
- That's all the thanks l need.

823
01:19:36,920 --> 01:19:40,230
You know, you're welcome to stay
if you like.

824
01:19:41,880 --> 01:19:46,749
Appreciate the offer but l don't think
l'd really fit in around here.

825
01:19:46,840 --> 01:19:49,195
You'd fit in better than you think.

826
01:19:50,080 --> 01:19:52,116
l like the cross.

827
01:19:52,840 --> 01:19:56,753
- Yeah? My father gave it to me.
- lt suits you.
