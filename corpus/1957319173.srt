1
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:51,833
Hey, who are you?

2
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,700
Do you know what happened?

3
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:00,940
You mean you didn't see that?

4
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:03,443
See what?

5
00:03:05,399 --> 00:03:08,183
There was a big flash of
light, everything went bright.

6
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,240
I didn't see anything.

7
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:13,030
Do you have a TV?

8
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:16,818
Can we see if there's
anything on the news, please?

9
00:03:16,818 --> 00:03:17,651
Okay.

10
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:21,423
Come on.

11
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,223
Are you alone?

12
00:03:32,329 --> 00:03:33,163
- Yeah, why?

13
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,030
- Can I get you something to drink?

14
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:01,233
- Sure, sure.

15
00:04:12,179 --> 00:04:13,690
I'm Sasha, by the way.

16
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:14,540
- I'm Cole.

17
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:22,443
- Thanks.

18
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:30,600
- What are you doing way out here?

19
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:33,250
- I was with my boyfriend,

20
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:40,983
and then he was gone, he disappeared.

21
00:04:42,159 --> 00:04:43,523
- I'm sure he's around.

22
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:49,860
What do you say we go into town?

23
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:52,230
He probably got lost.

24
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:54,050
It's pretty easy to do around here.

25
00:04:55,292 --> 00:04:57,106
- Yeah, yeah.

26
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:16,983
- Sorry about the outhouse.

27
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:19,757
- Oh, it's all right.

28
00:05:19,757 --> 00:05:21,007
I've been camping before.

29
00:05:29,742 --> 00:05:32,825
- What do you say we call it a night?

30
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:36,290
I won't try anything, I promise.

31
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:39,983
- Okay.

32
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:46,550
- You take the
bed, I'll take the couch.

33
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:47,383
- Are you sure?

34
00:05:48,659 --> 00:05:49,493
- Yeah.

35
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:51,990
Can I get you anything?

36
00:05:54,056 --> 00:05:55,193
- Just a glass of water.

37
00:05:56,685 --> 00:05:57,852
- Okay.

38
00:07:08,214 --> 00:07:10,258
- There you are.

39
00:07:10,258 --> 00:07:11,091
- Morning.

40
00:07:14,023 --> 00:07:15,323
Know what you're thinking.

41
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:17,720
It's the 2000s, and this guy

42
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,420
still gets his water from a creek.

43
00:07:20,414 --> 00:07:22,464
- I wasn't gonna say anything.

44
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:29,330
- Just like to enjoy the
simpler things in life.

45
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:34,650
- I wish my life was simple.

46
00:07:40,212 --> 00:07:42,168
- Would you mind?

47
00:07:42,168 --> 00:07:43,418
- Sure.

48
00:07:48,383 --> 00:07:50,740
- So, I was thinking about
what you said last night,

49
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:51,990
about the flash of light.

50
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,969
What do you think it was?

51
00:07:54,969 --> 00:07:55,802
- Hey, wait!

52
00:07:55,802 --> 00:07:56,635
- Sasha!

53
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:01,703
Hey.

54
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:03,960
What was all that about?

55
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:07,690
- There was a little girl.

56
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:13,873
- Where?

57
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:30,593
I'm sorry.

58
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:32,732
- For what?

59
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,460
- I know you're worried right now.

60
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:41,450
- First Blake, then this
little girl shows up.

61
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:43,640
I just don't know what the
hell's going on anymore.

62
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,893
- I don't know about any girl, except you.

63
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:50,933
But it can't just be the two of us.

64
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:02,110
Have you read it?

65
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,843
- Parts of it, when I was younger.

66
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:13,410
- You don't think-

67
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:15,030
- The rapture?

68
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:15,863
- Yeah.

69
00:09:15,863 --> 00:09:18,963
- I thought about it,
but everybody's gone.

70
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,520
- I didn't think about that.

71
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,020
I mean, surely we're not the only two

72
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:29,420
sinning nonbelievers around.

73
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:39,163
- Blake believes in God.

74
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,230
- Yeah, me, too.

75
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:48,113
- Then where has everybody gone?

76
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:49,983
- I don't know.

77
00:09:52,466 --> 00:09:54,130
I'm gonna find out, though.

78
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,280
- Somebody doesn't get out much.

79
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,480
- Yeah, one of the perks of
working at the factory, I guess.

80
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:16,123
- Yeah.

81
00:10:16,123 --> 00:10:18,370
- I don't really go into
town unless I have to.

82
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:23,103
- I don't suppose you get
Chinese delivery out here.

83
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:32,180
Any cell service, any cell signal yet?

84
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:34,080
- Nah, it doesn't really work up here.

85
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,630
- What happened to you?

86
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:47,230
I guess we'll save that for another time.

87
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:49,163
Look, thanks for letting me stay.

88
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:51,397
I really appreciate it.

89
00:10:51,397 --> 00:10:52,230
You didn't have to.

90
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:53,063
- Yeah, I did.

91
00:10:53,063 --> 00:10:55,270
It's nice to have someone to talk to,

92
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:56,470
even for a little while.

93
00:11:02,287 --> 00:11:05,683
But my people skills could
probably use a little work.

94
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:09,273
- You're like the Tom
Cruise of cabin dwellers.

95
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,100
- Show me the money.

96
00:11:27,556 --> 00:11:28,440
Hey.

97
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,060
- Hey.

98
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:35,060
Do you mind if I clean up a little bit?

99
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:36,543
- Yeah, be my guest.

100
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:44,140
- Do you mind?

101
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:44,973
- Sure.

102
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:58,200
I guess I'll see you in the morning.

103
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,033
- Night.

104
00:12:00,427 --> 00:12:02,060
- Night.

105
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:07,060
Oh, if you need to, use
the water in the jug,

106
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:08,450
and, if you have to go-

107
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:10,350
- I'll take it outside.

108
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:11,183
- Yeah.

109
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:18,280
Oh, also, if you want, I
have a shirt you can use.

110
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:20,820
Just throwing that out there.

111
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:21,653
- Thanks.

112
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:27,833
- All right.

113
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:31,023
Night.

114
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:40,253
- Hey, can I get that shirt?

115
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:43,253
- Yeah.

116
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:46,663
- I saw her photo.

117
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,113
She was beautiful.

118
00:13:05,715 --> 00:13:06,548
You scared me.

119
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:10,077
I'm Sasha, what's your name?

120
00:13:10,077 --> 00:13:10,910
- Mya.

121
00:13:12,171 --> 00:13:13,004
- Hi, Mya.

122
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,080
What are you doing here?

123
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,457
Do you know what happened?

124
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:22,773
Can you tell me?

125
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:29,493
Can I trust Cole?

126
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:32,765
- Shh.

127
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:39,928
- Hey, are you still up?

128
00:13:39,928 --> 00:13:40,883
Sorry to bother you.

129
00:13:41,965 --> 00:13:44,788
- It's all right.

130
00:13:44,788 --> 00:13:46,138
- I thought I heard voices.

131
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:48,760
- Sometimes I talk in my sleep.

132
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:52,563
- I'm sorry, I didn't
know you were sleeping.

133
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:54,590
- Oh, it's just late.

134
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:08,530
- I can't sleep right now.

135
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:11,013
I don't-

136
00:14:12,138 --> 00:14:13,888
- What is it?

137
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:18,343
You can tell me.

138
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,170
- I'll let you get some rest.

139
00:15:13,907 --> 00:15:17,083
What are you doing in my house?

140
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:21,113
- We need to talk, Cole.

141
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:24,030
- How do you know my name?

142
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,670
- That's unimportant.

143
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:28,473
Come sit down.

144
00:15:30,551 --> 00:15:31,601
- I'll stand, thanks.

145
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:34,373
- She's dangerous.

146
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,880
- Sasha?
- Mm hmm.

147
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:41,673
Her past is clouded in mystery.

148
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:46,490
- I don't exactly have
the best past, either.

149
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:49,800
- You need to get rid of
her, before it's too late.

150
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,156
- Get rid of her?

151
00:15:51,156 --> 00:15:52,420
I just met her.

152
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:53,290
- You know, your father once-

153
00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:56,803
- Whoa, whoa, you knew my father?

154
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:00,763
- Yes.

155
00:16:02,372 --> 00:16:04,277
But don't trouble yourself
about that right now.

156
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:10,793
- Do you know where everyone's gone?

157
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:38,710
- You've been dealt a particularly unique

158
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:40,053
hand of cards, my friend.

159
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:42,600
There's nothing I can say to give you

160
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:45,653
a satisfactory explanation
for what you're going through.

161
00:16:48,081 --> 00:16:49,310
- I just want answers.

162
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:51,263
- You're gonna have to
figure it out on your own,

163
00:16:52,925 --> 00:16:54,133
and you don't have much time.

164
00:16:56,690 --> 00:16:57,553
- Time for what?

165
00:16:59,629 --> 00:17:01,340
- If you don't get rid of her soon,

166
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:04,093
everything you know is in
danger of becoming extinct.

167
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:07,829
- How much time do I have?

168
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:11,933
- A week, maybe less.

169
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:18,492
- Hey.

170
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:22,690
What's your name?

171
00:17:22,690 --> 00:17:25,063
- It's Flynn, but that's not important.

172
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:29,813
Clock's ticking, Cole.

173
00:17:55,989 --> 00:17:59,220
- Hey, about last-
- Look, I'm-

174
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:00,053
- Go ahead.

175
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:02,983
- It's okay.

176
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:11,100
- Everything's a little off.

177
00:18:14,188 --> 00:18:17,049
I really don't know what's
going on around here.

178
00:18:17,049 --> 00:18:18,137
- You're not the only one.

179
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,200
- See, that's just it.

180
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:25,630
- What do you mean?

181
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,130
- Do you really think
we're the only ones left?

182
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:31,690
- I don't know.

183
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:33,710
I mean, if so, why us?

184
00:18:37,865 --> 00:18:39,115
- I don't know.

185
00:18:40,993 --> 00:18:45,493
I don't think I'd be very
good for starting over with.

186
00:18:46,621 --> 00:18:47,980
- I'm not perfect, either.

187
00:18:49,455 --> 00:18:51,128
- You seem all right to me.

188
00:18:51,128 --> 00:18:52,170
I mean, you're female.

189
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:57,723
- I'm no Eve, but I can give it a shot.

190
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:01,790
She is the one that tempted Adam.

191
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:03,290
- You planning on tempting me?

192
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:06,683
- Got any forbidden fruit laying around?

193
00:19:20,865 --> 00:19:21,865
- I'm sorry.

194
00:19:23,132 --> 00:19:24,370
- What do you mean?

195
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:26,140
- I couldn't help but notice you're upset.

196
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:28,677
I'm on my way inside, on my own.

197
00:19:30,471 --> 00:19:32,510
I know it's a little lame,
but if you'd like to-

198
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:33,343
- Sure.

199
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:35,310
- Sure what?

200
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:36,700
- I'll join you.

201
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:38,260
- Really?

202
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,540
- I'm here, you're here.

203
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:41,690
Might as well make the most of it.

204
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:42,523
- Okay.

205
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,123
- I'm Sasha.
- Blake.

206
00:19:56,450 --> 00:19:57,710
What happened back there?

207
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,353
- Asshole.

208
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:05,553
- Listen, as guys,
we're wired to be dicks.

209
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:10,050
It's only through proper
training and conditioning

210
00:20:10,930 --> 00:20:13,625
that we can treat women with respect.

211
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:16,540
- Is that so?

212
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:17,373
- Yeah.

213
00:20:19,971 --> 00:20:20,804
Yeah.

214
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:25,660
- I thought we really had something.

215
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:27,460
- She was your cousin.

216
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:29,320
- But we really connected.

217
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:31,230
- Blood is thicker than water, boys.

218
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,160
At least, that's what they say.

219
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,600
Hit me.

220
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,860
- Saddle up, little doggies,

221
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:37,481
we's going out on the
open prairie tonight.

222
00:20:38,314 --> 00:20:40,180
- How about you, Chuck,
how's your love life?

223
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:41,970
- Eh, you know, I do all right.

224
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:43,160
- All right, huh?

225
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,750
- He's dating my best friend Kate.

226
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:46,770
- When did this happen?
- You knew?

227
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:48,820
- We're friends, doofus, and we're girls.

228
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:50,147
We talk.

229
00:20:50,147 --> 00:20:51,090
- You talk, do you, is that what you do?

230
00:20:51,090 --> 00:20:52,310
And what do you talk about,

231
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:54,543
other than my scorching good looks.

232
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:58,170
- Just girl stuff.

233
00:20:58,170 --> 00:20:59,350
- Beer, boobs, and football?

234
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:00,800
- You guessed it, Mikey.
- Whose boobs?

235
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,780
- Can we please stay
on the matter at hand?

236
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:03,770
- And what matter is that?

237
00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:04,780
- Kate!

238
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:05,950
What did she say about me?

239
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:06,783
- Hit me.

240
00:21:23,444 --> 00:21:24,444
- Oh, did I?

241
00:21:26,908 --> 00:21:28,158
- Yeah.
- Sorry.

242
00:21:29,042 --> 00:21:29,875
- It's all right.

243
00:21:29,875 --> 00:21:30,710
Let's get outta here.

244
00:21:31,579 --> 00:21:32,412
- Yeah.

245
00:21:58,937 --> 00:22:00,690
- If anyone
can hear this message,

246
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:04,582
you are.

247
00:22:04,582 --> 00:22:06,201
If anyone can hear this message,

248
00:22:06,201 --> 00:22:11,201
you are not alone.

249
00:22:43,151 --> 00:22:44,530
- Why do you keep doing that?

250
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:46,113
- You startle easily.

251
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:54,013
- You knew this was the end
of the world, didn't you?

252
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:58,690
Why didn't you tell me?

253
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:03,283
- Look, we need to go.

254
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:05,303
- Where?

255
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:10,363
Cole's the only one around.

256
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:14,080
Don't you think it's better
if we stick together?

257
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:44,180
- Glad to have you back.

258
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:47,080
- I'm sorry about last night.

259
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:50,190
- You're free to leave whenever you want.

260
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:51,353
It's not a prison here.

261
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:54,873
- I know, it's-
- It's fine.

262
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:59,690
- It's not like me to just take
off without saying goodbye.

263
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:02,860
- So, is that was this is?

264
00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:08,100
Maybe we should go our own separate ways,

265
00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:10,280
for a little while.

266
00:24:15,439 --> 00:24:17,500
- What are you doing?

267
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:19,293
- Losing what's left of my sanity.

268
00:24:20,410 --> 00:24:21,810
- Why do you have all these?

269
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:28,780
You're not one of those

270
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:31,433
end of the world type creeps, are you?

271
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:36,590
- No, actually, I haven't
even read half of these books.

272
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:38,270
Besides, I don't even own a bomb shelter.

273
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:40,730
I'm pretty sure that's a requirement.

274
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:42,963
- Yeah.

275
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,790
- I'll let you know if I find anything.

276
00:25:28,010 --> 00:25:29,690
- You're pathetic.

277
00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:31,483
You've really let yourself go.

278
00:25:32,609 --> 00:25:35,550
You're pathetic.

279
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:38,903
You have really let
yourself go.

280
00:25:40,963 --> 00:25:41,796
- Mom?

281
00:25:42,770 --> 00:25:44,720
- Don't give me that!

282
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:47,060
Is this how you wanna spend
the rest of your life,

283
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:48,243
or what's left of it?

284
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:54,400
- I don't know what to do.

285
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,700
Things haven't been the same since-

286
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:58,786
- So you decided to just waste away.

287
00:25:58,786 --> 00:25:59,950
- Well, I don't even
know if there's a world

288
00:25:59,950 --> 00:26:01,983
for me to be part of anymore.

289
00:26:01,983 --> 00:26:03,210
- God!
- I mean, for all I know,

290
00:26:03,210 --> 00:26:04,750
I'm the last man on earth.

291
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:06,730
- Oh, well, what about
that girl

292
00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:08,190
you've been spending so much time with?

293
00:26:08,190 --> 00:26:09,023
- Sasha.

294
00:26:09,023 --> 00:26:10,240
- Tramp.

295
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:13,230
- She's not a tramp, she's
just as confused as I am.

296
00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:16,440
- No one will ever be as confused as you.

297
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,133
- I devoted my life to you!

298
00:26:19,241 --> 00:26:22,503
- Whatever
helps you sleep at night.

299
00:26:23,970 --> 00:26:26,498
- This is the end of the world, and you.

300
00:26:29,586 --> 00:26:30,442
You're dead.

301
00:26:49,186 --> 00:26:51,436
What the hell am I missing?

302
00:27:16,088 --> 00:27:16,921
Candace?

303
00:27:45,871 --> 00:27:48,204
Did you do what you need to?

304
00:27:49,452 --> 00:27:50,285
- Yeah.

305
00:27:54,913 --> 00:27:57,273
What if we are the last people on Earth?

306
00:28:01,344 --> 00:28:02,594
- I don't know.

307
00:28:04,870 --> 00:28:05,703
Repopulate?

308
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:09,993
- You would like that, wouldn't you?

309
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:17,140
You are totally into me, aren't you?

310
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:18,580
- I've seen better.

311
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:19,813
- Oh, better, huh?

312
00:28:21,150 --> 00:28:22,850
Do you see any better around here?

313
00:28:24,698 --> 00:28:26,398
- I don't see anybody around here.

314
00:28:27,329 --> 00:28:28,603
- That's what I thought.

315
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:33,610
- So where'd you go?

316
00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:40,240
It's all right, you don't have to say it.

317
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,363
- It's just things have
been so strange lately.

318
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:48,980
- You mean besides the apocalypse?

319
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:53,410
There's been a lot of other weird stuff

320
00:28:53,410 --> 00:28:54,460
going on around here.

321
00:28:56,114 --> 00:28:57,781
- Weird how?

322
00:28:59,275 --> 00:29:02,942
- Well, I had an argument
with my dead wife,

323
00:29:03,890 --> 00:29:06,900
and I also had a
conversation with my mother,

324
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:07,923
who is also dead.

325
00:29:09,270 --> 00:29:10,103
- Really.

326
00:29:11,090 --> 00:29:13,040
- I've also been seeing this guy Flynn.

327
00:29:15,550 --> 00:29:16,383
- Who's he?

328
00:29:21,770 --> 00:29:22,763
- What is it?

329
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:25,013
- Nothing.

330
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:29,560
- Please, tell me I'm not going crazy.

331
00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:35,783
- Better prep the padded
room, reservation for two.

332
00:29:40,372 --> 00:29:41,205
- Come on.

333
00:29:54,210 --> 00:29:55,430
- No offense, but those clothes

334
00:29:55,430 --> 00:29:57,180
look like they've seen better days.

335
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:02,340
- They're all I have.

336
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:05,160
- Still have some of my
wife's clothes in the closet.

337
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,600
- Oh, you don't have to.

338
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:07,433
- It's okay.

339
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,430
She has no need for them anymore,

340
00:30:10,430 --> 00:30:12,763
so you're welcome to help yourself.

341
00:30:15,910 --> 00:30:16,743
- Thank you.

342
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:29,537
What do you think?

343
00:30:31,379 --> 00:30:33,020
- You look good.

344
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:34,170
- Yeah, I know.

345
00:30:43,047 --> 00:30:45,640
- I'm glad you decided to come back.

346
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:46,473
- Yeah, me, too.

347
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:55,570
I know it's none of my business,

348
00:30:55,570 --> 00:31:00,270
but why haven't you, you
know, gotten back out there?

349
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:12,610
- When you meet someone
who just really takes

350
00:31:12,610 --> 00:31:13,473
your breath away.

351
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:19,943
- Well, what happened, if
you don't mind me asking?

352
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:24,673
- She was out collecting
water from the creek,

353
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:27,850
the way she did every morning.

354
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,563
She loves being outdoors.

355
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:39,793
Something just felt wrong.

356
00:31:41,630 --> 00:31:43,280
So I went out to go check on her.

357
00:32:07,970 --> 00:32:09,053
- I'm so sorry.

358
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:12,990
- Her ring was laying nearby.

359
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:19,070
- It's all right.

360
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:20,623
I'm here, love.

361
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:23,713
What is it?

362
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:29,127
- Nothing, it's just
something she used to say.

363
00:32:30,788 --> 00:32:31,621
- Oh.

364
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:37,063
- What is this?

365
00:32:42,328 --> 00:32:43,911
- Hey, what's that?

366
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:46,893
- Looks like she was writing a book.

367
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:49,670
- You should probably respect her privacy.

368
00:32:49,670 --> 00:32:50,923
- I have to read that.

369
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:56,600
- She wouldn't want you
thumbing through her things.

370
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,380
- Well, why wouldn't she tell me about it?

371
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:00,250
- Everybody has secrets, Cole.

372
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:02,043
Some things are better left alone.

373
00:33:19,117 --> 00:33:20,360
- What did I
tell you about the girl?

374
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:21,253
- Jeez.

375
00:33:22,617 --> 00:33:23,910
- Well?

376
00:33:23,910 --> 00:33:25,130
- Yeah, I know what you said,

377
00:33:25,130 --> 00:33:27,000
it's just-
- You like her.

378
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,760
- There might be something to her.

379
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,260
- Yeah.

380
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:37,943
She's gorgeous, possibly the
last woman on the planet,

381
00:33:39,158 --> 00:33:40,325
and, you know.

382
00:33:42,831 --> 00:33:43,664
- And what?

383
00:33:43,664 --> 00:33:45,263
- And she reminds you of?

384
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:49,520
- No.

385
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:51,120
- You miss her?

386
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:54,310
- Of course I miss her,
but Sasha's not even-

387
00:33:54,310 --> 00:33:56,880
- There's things you
still don't understand.

388
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:59,030
- There's a hell of a
lot I don't understand.

389
00:33:59,030 --> 00:34:00,980
Women are just one of those things.

390
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:04,420
- Cole, there's forces
working against you.

391
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:07,330
- Why are you even here.

392
00:34:07,330 --> 00:34:08,960
There's no way that you can be real.

393
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:09,862
- What's reality?

394
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:13,290
- Why are we talking philosophy?

395
00:34:14,409 --> 00:34:17,103
- If your brain thinks
something is real, it's real.

396
00:34:20,389 --> 00:34:23,040
- My brain tells me there
is no way that you're real.

397
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:25,889
But here we are, carrying on

398
00:34:25,889 --> 00:34:27,889
like two characters in a bad soap opera.

399
00:34:30,730 --> 00:34:31,730
Are you real or not?

400
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:34,306
- You decide.

401
00:34:40,429 --> 00:34:41,263
- Flynn?

402
00:34:45,245 --> 00:34:46,078
Flynn?

403
00:34:57,460 --> 00:34:59,040
- My God, are you okay?

404
00:34:59,040 --> 00:34:59,990
- I'll live.

405
00:35:01,150 --> 00:35:02,483
- What happened?

406
00:35:05,754 --> 00:35:08,054
- I thought I saw my
wife's ring in the creek.

407
00:35:09,033 --> 00:35:10,228
- So you dove in?

408
00:35:10,228 --> 00:35:12,145
- No, I slipped.

409
00:35:13,069 --> 00:35:14,659
- Let's get you cleaned up.

410
00:35:14,659 --> 00:35:15,905
Let's get a shower.

411
00:36:24,423 --> 00:36:26,150
That's a new look.

412
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:27,700
- Well, it's time for a change.

413
00:36:34,310 --> 00:36:36,047
What are we gonna do
with the rest of our day?

414
00:36:38,569 --> 00:36:39,969
- We could just stay in bed.

415
00:36:41,870 --> 00:36:44,040
- You're something
else, you know that?

416
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:44,873
- Oh, I know.

417
00:36:49,663 --> 00:36:50,713
Blake!

418
00:36:52,372 --> 00:36:53,930
- What's wrong, baby?

419
00:36:53,930 --> 00:36:56,170
- What are you doing here?

420
00:36:56,170 --> 00:36:58,270
- Rocking your world, if I'm not mistaken.

421
00:37:01,030 --> 00:37:02,780
What are you doing with this loser?

422
00:37:03,910 --> 00:37:04,743
- Cole?

423
00:37:05,802 --> 00:37:07,553
- How many guys are you sleeping with?

424
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:14,295
You know, I never would've
pegged you for a cheater.

425
00:37:14,295 --> 00:37:15,760
- That's not fair!
- No, what's not fair

426
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,660
is you don't whether or
not I'm dead or alive,

427
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:19,690
and, yet, here you are banging this idiot.

428
00:37:19,690 --> 00:37:21,200
- You disappeared!

429
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,033
- How do you know I just didn't go

430
00:37:22,033 --> 00:37:24,150
down to the pub, get shit-faced,

431
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:26,364
and end up in the gutter
for a couple of days?

432
00:37:26,364 --> 00:37:28,401
- I don't know what you want me to say.

433
00:37:28,401 --> 00:37:29,560
- No, you know what?

434
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:30,560
I see where I stand.

435
00:37:31,590 --> 00:37:32,913
- Wait, Blake!

436
00:37:38,879 --> 00:37:40,879
- Did you say something?

437
00:37:42,127 --> 00:37:43,577
- No, I was talking out loud.

438
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:45,493
- Okay.

439
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,983
Wanna try heading out to the pub?

440
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:54,310
- Yeah, I'll get dressed.

441
00:37:59,464 --> 00:38:00,464
- All right.

442
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:06,160
- You think we're gonna
find anything in there?

443
00:38:08,575 --> 00:38:10,075
It's worth a shot.

444
00:38:11,354 --> 00:38:13,096
- At the very least,
we can get some drinks.

445
00:38:13,096 --> 00:38:14,429
- Oh, hell yeah.

446
00:38:24,088 --> 00:38:26,525
- Are you good at pool?

447
00:38:26,525 --> 00:38:28,358
- I can kick your ass.

448
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:30,720
- I need to hit the head.

449
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:33,387
Where do you think the bathroom's at?

450
00:38:33,387 --> 00:38:35,100
Follow the signs, okay.

451
00:38:39,563 --> 00:38:41,280
Oh, here we go.

452
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,977
I'll go this way, and you go that way.

453
00:39:21,773 --> 00:39:23,440
Are you seeing this?

454
00:39:25,064 --> 00:39:25,897
- Uh huh.

455
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:30,193
I was not expecting people.

456
00:39:36,828 --> 00:39:38,078
- Let's mingle.

457
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,667
- Hey, bud.

458
00:39:48,667 --> 00:39:49,599
- Me?

459
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:50,651
- Come here.

460
00:39:56,349 --> 00:39:57,182
- Thanks.

461
00:40:01,324 --> 00:40:02,737
Do I know you?

462
00:40:02,737 --> 00:40:05,250
- Nah, man, you don't know me,

463
00:40:05,250 --> 00:40:06,300
but maybe you should.

464
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:09,273
- Okay.

465
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:12,773
- Drink up.

466
00:40:14,530 --> 00:40:15,453
But I know you.

467
00:40:16,610 --> 00:40:17,910
You're the apocalypse guy.

468
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:21,330
- So you're not real, either?

469
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:25,220
- Perception is reality.

470
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:27,190
Everyone knows that.

471
00:40:27,190 --> 00:40:29,040
- Okay, are you the Riddler or?

472
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:31,493
- No, man, no, I'm not the Riddler.

473
00:40:32,634 --> 00:40:33,467
I'm Blake.

474
00:40:34,586 --> 00:40:36,150
- Hi, Blake.

475
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:37,143
- Sasha's Blake.

476
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:39,293
- Oh.

477
00:40:42,010 --> 00:40:43,510
Well, hey, she's around here.

478
00:40:43,510 --> 00:40:44,650
I'm sure she'd be really happy-

479
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:46,820
- It's not her I'm interested in.

480
00:40:49,193 --> 00:40:50,026
- Oh.

481
00:40:51,485 --> 00:40:53,318
What can I do for you?

482
00:40:55,575 --> 00:40:57,535
- You can stay the hell away from my girl.

483
00:40:57,535 --> 00:40:59,200
- Look, I didn't know that she was-

484
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,300
- I know what you did.

485
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,750
- Okay.

486
00:41:02,750 --> 00:41:05,883
No offense, but as far as I can tell,

487
00:41:07,430 --> 00:41:10,263
she's the only one who's
real in here, besides me.

488
00:41:14,635 --> 00:41:15,770
Thanks for the drink.

489
00:41:15,770 --> 00:41:16,603
- Keep it real.

490
00:41:29,914 --> 00:41:31,736
- What did I tell you about the girl?

491
00:41:31,736 --> 00:41:34,488
- I know, I know.

492
00:41:34,488 --> 00:41:36,405
- You're not listening.

493
00:41:38,531 --> 00:41:39,366
She's coming.

494
00:41:43,665 --> 00:41:46,147
- Who's your friend?

495
00:41:46,147 --> 00:41:47,589
I'm Sasha.

496
00:42:04,810 --> 00:42:08,352
What the hell is his problem?

497
00:42:08,352 --> 00:42:09,185
- He's a comic.

498
00:42:13,737 --> 00:42:16,654
Find anyone interesting to talk to?

499
00:42:18,573 --> 00:42:20,353
- Just one of my imaginary friends.

500
00:42:26,131 --> 00:42:29,376
- We should probably head back.

501
00:42:29,376 --> 00:42:32,503
- Cole, we might not get
another chance like this.

502
00:42:35,103 --> 00:42:36,092
- Let's go.

503
00:42:41,481 --> 00:42:42,314
- Blake!

504
00:43:15,155 --> 00:43:16,405
How ya feeling?

505
00:43:17,587 --> 00:43:18,683
- How do I look?

506
00:43:19,870 --> 00:43:20,870
- Like shit.

507
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,737
I talked to him, you know.

508
00:43:32,737 --> 00:43:34,543
- And you didn't say anything?

509
00:43:35,450 --> 00:43:40,200
- I didn't know who he was, at first.

510
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:43,023
He's not real, you know.

511
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:46,563
- How do we even know what's real anymore?

512
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:54,150
- What if they're just
distracting us from-

513
00:43:54,150 --> 00:43:56,400
- What, from what we're
supposed to be doing?

514
00:43:58,180 --> 00:43:59,013
- Yeah

515
00:43:59,013 --> 00:44:00,423
- What are we supposed to be doing?

516
00:44:07,570 --> 00:44:08,770
- I'm reading that book.

517
00:44:11,650 --> 00:44:12,680
- What book?

518
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:13,880
- Candace's book.

519
00:44:23,154 --> 00:44:24,090
- What do you think you're doing?

520
00:44:24,090 --> 00:44:25,620
- Trying to find out
what's so damn important

521
00:44:25,620 --> 00:44:27,420
she didn't want me to know about it.

522
00:44:37,388 --> 00:44:38,477
"They lived in a quaint cabin in the woods

523
00:44:38,477 --> 00:44:40,994
"outside a small Colorado town.

524
00:44:40,994 --> 00:44:42,967
"A soft flowing creek ran
behind their loving home,

525
00:44:42,967 --> 00:44:44,367
"and provided the perfect backdrop

526
00:44:44,367 --> 00:44:45,837
"for what they hoped would one day be home

527
00:44:45,837 --> 00:44:47,307
"to their future children."

528
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:52,370
Is this about us?

529
00:44:59,367 --> 00:45:00,563
"Sasha knew."

530
00:45:01,650 --> 00:45:02,483
Sasha?

531
00:45:04,157 --> 00:45:06,637
"Sasha knew she could never
tell him what happened.

532
00:45:06,637 --> 00:45:08,097
"He would be crushed.

533
00:45:08,097 --> 00:45:09,517
"Blake had always wanted a child,

534
00:45:09,517 --> 00:45:11,217
"and the loss would devastate him.

535
00:45:14,147 --> 00:45:16,217
"Several years passed,
but she never told him

536
00:45:16,217 --> 00:45:17,853
"about the miscarriage.

537
00:45:19,117 --> 00:45:21,227
"Their love had been the
one constant in their lives,

538
00:45:21,227 --> 00:45:24,397
"and she didn't wanna do
anything to put that in jeopardy.

539
00:45:24,397 --> 00:45:26,617
"Maybe one day they would
know the love of a child,

540
00:45:26,617 --> 00:45:29,837
"but Mya, she was her secret."

541
00:45:39,329 --> 00:45:40,429
What the hell is this?

542
00:45:42,024 --> 00:45:43,670
- I
told you not to read it.

543
00:45:43,670 --> 00:45:45,303
- Why are you in this book?

544
00:45:48,569 --> 00:45:50,183
- We knew you wouldn't understand.

545
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:52,873
- We?

546
00:45:54,270 --> 00:45:55,140
- I'm leaving.

547
00:45:55,140 --> 00:45:57,900
I can't stand to watch this
train wreck any longer.

548
00:45:57,900 --> 00:45:58,733
- Wait, Sasha!

549
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:01,810
Sasha!

550
00:46:01,810 --> 00:46:03,883
Sasha, where are you going?

551
00:46:06,270 --> 00:46:07,733
- I shouldn't have come back.

552
00:46:09,570 --> 00:46:10,653
Just leave me alone.

553
00:46:41,070 --> 00:46:41,903
- Dad?

554
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:49,160
What are you doing here?

555
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:51,113
- You need to quit worrying

556
00:46:51,113 --> 00:46:52,680
about what other people are doing,

557
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:54,773
and start thinking about
what you need to do.

558
00:46:55,890 --> 00:46:57,470
- Which is what?

559
00:46:57,470 --> 00:46:59,240
- It's time for you to make a choice.

560
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:01,100
- What choice?

561
00:47:01,100 --> 00:47:01,933
Dad.

562
00:47:16,060 --> 00:47:17,114
Are you Mya?

563
00:47:37,250 --> 00:47:38,403
My father blamed me.

564
00:47:40,355 --> 00:47:43,236
He climbed into a bottle,
and he never looked back.

565
00:48:47,629 --> 00:48:49,060
What do you want?

566
00:48:49,060 --> 00:48:50,290
Hey!

567
00:48:50,290 --> 00:48:51,373
- Get over yourself.

568
00:48:53,187 --> 00:48:54,830
- Can I help you?

569
00:48:54,830 --> 00:48:56,610
Just here to go through all my shit?

570
00:48:56,610 --> 00:48:57,800
- I'm here on business.

571
00:48:57,800 --> 00:48:59,083
- Well, I'm not buying.

572
00:49:00,060 --> 00:49:01,160
- I want my life back.

573
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:07,523
You're obviously confused, Cole, as usual.

574
00:49:08,470 --> 00:49:09,660
- Why are you even here?

575
00:49:09,660 --> 00:49:12,071
Do you wanna borrow
some sugar or something?

576
00:49:12,071 --> 00:49:14,313
- You're funny.

577
00:49:15,150 --> 00:49:17,023
Sugar, nah, not sugar.

578
00:49:18,490 --> 00:49:19,323
Blood, maybe.

579
00:49:20,450 --> 00:49:21,343
Maybe pain.

580
00:49:23,270 --> 00:49:24,923
- What are you talking about?

581
00:49:26,794 --> 00:49:28,838
- Was I rambling again?

582
00:49:28,838 --> 00:49:30,500
Maybe there's something in the water.

583
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:31,833
- Get to the point!

584
00:49:33,020 --> 00:49:35,400
- Take it easy, I come in peace.

585
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:36,700
- Why don't I believe you?

586
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:39,433
- 'Cause I'm obviously lying.

587
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:43,063
We're all lying, Cole.

588
00:49:44,185 --> 00:49:45,873
You're just too dumb to figure it out.

589
00:49:45,873 --> 00:49:46,771
- Then why don't you tell me

590
00:49:46,771 --> 00:49:48,140
what the hell is going on?

591
00:49:48,140 --> 00:49:50,563
- The answers will come, in time.

592
00:49:51,450 --> 00:49:55,283
And Sasha, she'll come back to you.

593
00:49:55,283 --> 00:49:56,580
- I thought she was your girl.

594
00:49:56,580 --> 00:49:57,780
- Things change.

595
00:49:59,620 --> 00:50:02,040
- Look, man, I didn't mean to.

596
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:03,340
- Woulda, coulda, shoulda.

597
00:50:04,650 --> 00:50:07,533
I'm not here for excuses or apologies.

598
00:50:08,490 --> 00:50:10,585
- Then what the hell do you want?

599
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:18,130
- Don't make the same mistakes I did.

600
00:51:43,307 --> 00:51:44,943
- What in the hell is
going on around here?

601
00:51:46,330 --> 00:51:47,780
- Let's go stretch your legs.

602
00:51:54,858 --> 00:51:55,783
- I saw my mom.

603
00:51:57,290 --> 00:51:58,440
- She's around.

604
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:03,050
- I had a daughter.

605
00:52:03,050 --> 00:52:05,003
I've been feeling terrible.

606
00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:09,790
- Well, that's to be expected.

607
00:52:09,790 --> 00:52:10,980
- Really?

608
00:52:10,980 --> 00:52:13,163
- Look, I'm not here to
answer your questions.

609
00:52:15,024 --> 00:52:17,050
- Then why are you here?

610
00:52:17,050 --> 00:52:18,313
- That's not important.

611
00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:20,733
What is important is this.

612
00:52:22,594 --> 00:52:23,540
- What do you know about this?

613
00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:25,560
- There's nothing but trouble in there.

614
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:28,110
You best get rid of it now
while you still have a chance.

615
00:52:28,110 --> 00:52:29,330
- I had a daughter.

616
00:52:29,330 --> 00:52:31,680
- Heed my warning, son.

617
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:33,290
That book is dangerous.

618
00:52:33,290 --> 00:52:35,370
It'll only hold you back,

619
00:52:35,370 --> 00:52:36,920
and you're running out of time.

620
00:52:39,130 --> 00:52:41,100
I'm afraid this is farewell.

621
00:52:41,100 --> 00:52:43,727
Good luck, I'll be rooting for you.

622
00:52:56,580 --> 00:52:57,413
- What now?

623
00:52:59,410 --> 00:53:01,051
The hell's your problem?

624
00:53:01,051 --> 00:53:02,710
- You know what they
say, if I can't have her.

625
00:53:02,710 --> 00:53:03,610
- You're not real.

626
00:53:04,730 --> 00:53:06,367
- That real enough for you?

627
00:53:07,804 --> 00:53:08,637
There ain't room enough in the world

628
00:53:08,637 --> 00:53:09,680
for the both of us, friend.

629
00:53:10,559 --> 00:53:12,080
- What the hell do you want?

630
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:14,942
- Face it, Cole, you're all alone.

631
00:53:23,130 --> 00:53:24,843
- Still reading those books?

632
00:53:25,810 --> 00:53:27,653
- They're actually pretty fascinating.

633
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:30,020
- This laundry is fascinating.

634
00:53:32,290 --> 00:53:33,200
- You know, one day, we'll have some kids,

635
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:35,400
and then we can make
them do all the chores.

636
00:53:37,010 --> 00:53:38,710
- Is that why you wanna have kids?

637
00:53:41,620 --> 00:53:43,570
- I wanna have kids because I love you,

638
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:47,533
and I want some little rascals
to share that love with.

639
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:49,720
- Good answer.

640
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:52,820
- What do you say we start trying?

641
00:53:52,820 --> 00:53:53,653
- Now?

642
00:53:54,712 --> 00:53:56,040
What about the laundry?

643
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:56,873
- It can wait.

644
00:54:15,090 --> 00:54:17,940
I used to think about what I
would do if I ever lost you.

645
00:54:23,142 --> 00:54:25,920
I'm talking to people that can't be real,

646
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:27,683
sleeping with women who aren't you.

647
00:54:31,232 --> 00:54:32,903
I don't know what I'm doing anymore.

648
00:54:35,490 --> 00:54:36,740
But I gotta do something.

649
00:54:47,907 --> 00:54:49,587
"Blake leaned over to Sasha and whispered

650
00:54:49,587 --> 00:54:50,927
"sweetly into her ear."

651
00:54:52,630 --> 00:54:54,630
What the hell are you trying to tell me?

652
00:54:56,110 --> 00:54:56,943
You're not real.

653
00:54:58,669 --> 00:55:00,330
- Don't you see, farm boy?

654
00:55:00,330 --> 00:55:01,520
- See what?

655
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:03,943
- You'll never defeat
me 'cause you are me.

656
00:55:17,562 --> 00:55:20,562
- No, no, come on, come on, come on.

657
00:55:26,276 --> 00:55:28,206
You're all I have left.

658
00:55:42,460 --> 00:55:43,293
Candace?

659
00:55:48,850 --> 00:55:49,800
I don't understand.

660
00:55:51,620 --> 00:55:52,670
- Come with me, Cole.

661
00:56:02,380 --> 00:56:03,330
- What's happening?

662
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:06,150
- There's something in the water.

663
00:56:07,580 --> 00:56:08,530
- What do you mean?

664
00:56:10,610 --> 00:56:11,660
- It's affecting you.

665
00:56:16,727 --> 00:56:18,894
You have to make a choice.

666
00:56:22,310 --> 00:56:23,343
- You or Sasha.

667
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:26,063
- No, the truth or.

668
00:56:29,090 --> 00:56:29,923
- The lie.

669
00:56:37,750 --> 00:56:38,960
I'm having such a good time with you,

670
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:40,210
but I know it's not real.

671
00:56:45,860 --> 00:56:47,283
Am I the last man on Earth?

672
00:56:49,030 --> 00:56:50,943
- Is that
what's important to you?

673
00:56:57,637 --> 00:57:01,773
- What about Sasha, the book?

674
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:08,003
- It was too personal
to use our real names.

675
00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:12,450
- Blake said...

676
00:57:17,530 --> 00:57:18,363
Theater.

677
00:57:38,910 --> 00:57:39,743
I'm sorry.

678
00:57:41,925 --> 00:57:43,540
- What do you mean?

679
00:57:43,540 --> 00:57:45,583
- I couldn't help but notice you're upset.

680
00:57:53,700 --> 00:57:56,363
I'm on my way in, all by myself.

681
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,250
I know it's kinda lame,
but I was wondering-

682
00:58:00,250 --> 00:58:01,083
- Sure.

683
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:04,610
- Sure what?

684
00:58:04,610 --> 00:58:05,783
- I'll join you.

685
00:58:07,090 --> 00:58:07,923
- Really?

686
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:11,410
- I'm here, you're here,

687
00:58:11,410 --> 00:58:13,110
might as well make the most of it.

688
00:58:14,140 --> 00:58:15,376
- Okay.

689
00:58:30,290 --> 00:58:31,940
That was the best day of my life.

690
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:33,713
- Mine, too.

691
00:58:37,053 --> 00:58:39,257
- What about Flynn?

692
00:58:39,257 --> 00:58:41,567
- You don't remember?

693
00:58:54,991 --> 00:58:55,824
Cole?

694
00:59:02,577 --> 00:59:04,577
- Can I help you?

695
00:59:05,705 --> 00:59:07,372
- Boy, you've grown.

696
00:59:08,414 --> 00:59:09,764
- I'm sorry, do I know you?

697
00:59:11,780 --> 00:59:14,730
- Last time I saw you, you were
knee-high to a grasshopper.

698
00:59:16,440 --> 00:59:19,420
My name's Flynn, but that's not important.

699
00:59:20,700 --> 00:59:22,450
I'm an old friend of your father's.

700
00:59:23,840 --> 00:59:25,380
- My father doesn't live here.

701
00:59:25,380 --> 00:59:26,213
- Yeah.

702
00:59:30,110 --> 00:59:31,620
Look, I'm sorry to be
the one to tell you this,

703
00:59:31,620 --> 00:59:33,233
but your dad passed away.

704
00:59:36,280 --> 00:59:37,513
I know you weren't close.

705
00:59:46,580 --> 00:59:47,980
- Do you know what happened?

706
00:59:52,820 --> 00:59:53,720
- He was drinking,

707
00:59:56,410 --> 00:59:58,023
like he often did, you know.

708
01:00:17,840 --> 01:00:19,953
Well, I'm sorry you
had to hear it from me.

709
01:00:24,740 --> 01:00:25,640
I'll be on my way.

710
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:32,400
- Hey, thanks for letting me know.

711
01:00:36,010 --> 01:00:36,910
- No problem, kid.

712
01:00:38,310 --> 01:00:39,600
See you around.

713
01:00:56,680 --> 01:00:57,973
- That was a hard day.

714
01:01:00,910 --> 01:01:01,743
- Yeah.

715
01:01:04,660 --> 01:01:07,950
Why are all these visions, these people,

716
01:01:07,950 --> 01:01:12,950
trying to keep Sasha, us, us,

717
01:01:14,870 --> 01:01:16,720
why are they trying to keep us apart?

718
01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:21,200
- Part of you would want to keep

719
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:22,793
the illusion alive forever,

720
01:01:24,100 --> 01:01:26,550
but your body can't take
much more of the poison.

721
01:01:39,189 --> 01:01:40,023
- I'm not ready.

722
01:01:54,210 --> 01:01:56,245
I still have so much...

723
01:02:08,679 --> 01:02:09,981
I still have so much.

724
01:04:41,260 --> 01:04:43,360
- This is Gunter Harrison.

725
01:04:43,360 --> 01:04:45,239
We have regained radio signal.

726
01:04:45,239 --> 01:04:47,590
I repeat, we are back on the air.

727
01:04:47,590 --> 01:04:51,030
If anyone can hear this
message, you are not alone.

728
01:04:51,030 --> 01:04:52,715
There are others.

729
01:04:52,715 --> 01:04:55,847
We are gathering in the
small town of Black Hawk.

730
01:04:55,847 --> 01:04:57,950
We have food and fresh water.

731
01:04:57,950 --> 01:05:00,240
I urge you to leave the
comfort of your homes,

732
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:02,811
make your way to Black
Hawk as quickly as you can,

733
01:05:02,811 --> 01:05:06,613
and, whatever you do, do
not trust the strangers.

734
01:05:06,613 --> 01:05:09,696
I repeat, do not trust the strangers.
