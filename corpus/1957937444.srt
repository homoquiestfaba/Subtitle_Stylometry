1
00:00:14,309 --> 00:00:17,479
{\an8}<i>Oh, hey, y'all,
it's New Year's Eve in New York City.</i>

2
00:00:17,729 --> 00:00:21,024
{\an8}<i>This is a story of a family
who needs a little help,</i>

3
00:00:21,399 --> 00:00:23,235
<i>like we all do sometimes.</i>

4
00:00:23,527 --> 00:00:27,906
{\an8}<i>Mom and Pop just can't seem to get along.
And Maria-Clara wishes they'd work it out</i>

5
00:00:27,989 --> 00:00:30,742
{\an8}<i>and light up the dance floor
like they used to back in the day.</i>

6
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:35,372
<i>As the community turns out to celebrate,</i>

7
00:00:35,539 --> 00:00:38,667
{\an8}<i>can some holiday magic
bring her parents back together?</i>

8
00:00:48,385 --> 00:00:53,348
{\an8}<i>Hey, let's get this thing in motion
Block so hot got me full of emotion</i>

9
00:00:53,598 --> 00:00:54,849
<i>Everybody's on the street</i>

10
00:00:54,933 --> 00:00:57,143
<i>Feel the energy
From your head to your feet</i>

11
00:00:57,227 --> 00:01:01,439
{\an8}<i>So crispy, fresh faded
Holiday's topnotch, upgraded</i>

12
00:01:01,523 --> 00:01:03,149
<i>Turn up for New Year's Eve</i>

13
00:01:03,233 --> 00:01:05,485
<i>Everybody getting ready
It's time to party</i>

14
00:01:05,569 --> 00:01:07,571
{\an8}<i>It's my block, I started this function</i>

15
00:01:07,696 --> 00:01:09,739
{\an8}<i>Back in the day
Where Hip-Hop was pumping</i>

16
00:01:09,823 --> 00:01:13,827
{\an8}<i>And I don't say this casually
I love these folks like family</i>

17
00:01:13,952 --> 00:01:15,954
{\an8}<i>And lemme tell you
About ones I watch over</i>

18
00:01:16,037 --> 00:01:18,103
{\an8}<i>Here's an introduction
To take a look closer</i>

19
00:01:18,206 --> 00:01:20,083
<i>Maria-Clara, she's the talk of the town</i>

20
00:01:20,166 --> 00:01:22,252
{\an8}<i>Loves her parents
But they're bringing her down</i>

21
00:01:22,419 --> 00:01:24,129
{\an8}<i>Whatever happened
To that night in the club</i>

22
00:01:24,254 --> 00:01:26,423
{\an8}<i>When they first saw each other
And they fell in love?</i>

23
00:01:26,715 --> 00:01:28,758
{\an8}<i>At the classic toy maker</i>

24
00:01:28,925 --> 00:01:30,885
{\an8}<i>Drosselmeyer time breaker</i>

25
00:01:30,969 --> 00:01:32,769
<i>She's got the vision
And she's making the plan</i>

26
00:01:32,887 --> 00:01:35,140
{\an8}<i>Always got a little bit of magic at hand</i>

27
00:01:41,771 --> 00:01:45,650
{\an8}<i>Old New
It's something like the fusion of the two</i>

28
00:01:46,401 --> 00:01:49,863
{\an8}<i>Tradition with a twist
Modern music don't miss...</i>

29
00:01:53,992 --> 00:01:55,994
<i>...It's finally time
Here's your last heads-up</i>

30
00:01:56,119 --> 00:01:59,039
<i>We got the power
Light this whole place up!</i>

31
00:01:59,414 --> 00:02:00,665
<i>Let's go!</i>

32
00:07:00,757 --> 00:07:01,758
<i>Time...</i>

33
00:07:03,384 --> 00:07:09,265
{\an8}<i>T... t... time is just...
T... t... time is just...</i>

34
00:07:15,521 --> 00:07:18,274
<i>Time is just another game to play.</i>

35
00:14:08,267 --> 00:14:10,186
Come on!

36
00:14:30,915 --> 00:14:33,334
<i>Yo, it's me again, your man on the block</i>

37
00:14:33,417 --> 00:14:35,878
<i>I've known all these kids
Since they started to walk</i>

38
00:14:36,087 --> 00:14:38,255
<i>Let me talk a second, now, listen to me</i>

39
00:14:38,381 --> 00:14:40,925
<i>Got good intuition
About the things that I see</i>

40
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:43,636
<i>Did you catch Maria-Clara
And The Nutcracker man?</i>

41
00:14:43,761 --> 00:14:46,263
<i>Their chemistry is cracking
And I think I'm a fan</i>

42
00:14:46,347 --> 00:14:48,724
<i>But just about the time
Love was sprouting up</i>

43
00:14:48,808 --> 00:14:51,310
<i>This fool went and left
To go sell some nuts</i>

44
00:14:51,394 --> 00:14:53,646
{\an8}<i>-Hey, you're gonna miss out</i>
-SIDE SINGER: <i>Miss out</i>

45
00:14:53,729 --> 00:14:55,981
<i>Don't let the girl get away
It's a handout</i>

46
00:14:56,107 --> 00:14:59,026
<i>She has a New Year's wish
That I heard about</i>

47
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:01,404
<i>To get her mom and dad
To work it all out...</i>

48
00:15:01,487 --> 00:15:02,488
<i>Yeah!</i>

49
00:15:02,613 --> 00:15:04,698
<i>...So that tonight, if things go right</i>

50
00:15:04,782 --> 00:15:07,118
{\an8}<i>-Her parents will kiss by midnight</i>
-SIDE SINGER: <i>Midnight</i>

51
00:15:07,201 --> 00:15:11,664
{\an8}<i>So, go help them find a spark
Might just help your spark to start</i>

52
00:15:11,872 --> 00:15:15,626
<i>I'm Cool Peep, so I'll watch your cart
Hurry up</i>

53
00:15:15,751 --> 00:15:17,461
{\an8}<i>before the love departs, go!</i>

54
00:25:26,486 --> 00:25:28,030
<i>Snowflakes</i>

55
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:28,715
<i>Snowflakes</i>

56
00:27:57,304 --> 00:27:59,264
<i>Throw your hands up, throw your hands up</i>

57
00:27:59,472 --> 00:28:01,474
<i>If you're back in time
Throw your hands up</i>

58
00:28:01,683 --> 00:28:03,643
<i>Throw your hands up, throw your hands up</i>

59
00:28:03,768 --> 00:28:05,854
<i>If you're back in time
Throw your hands up</i>

60
00:28:05,979 --> 00:28:08,440
<i>Another New Year's Eve
And I'm feeling terrific</i>

61
00:28:08,607 --> 00:28:10,483
<i>Back in the day, yeah, non-specific</i>

62
00:28:10,609 --> 00:28:12,652
<i>Where love first bloomed
When the vibes were right</i>

63
00:28:12,736 --> 00:28:14,654
<i>I mingle but I tingle too
Two hearts, so bright</i>

64
00:28:14,821 --> 00:28:18,742
<i>But let's not jump the gun
'Cause the night is still so young</i>

65
00:28:19,201 --> 00:28:23,288
<i>So grab a partner, feel the beat
And both get locked in the song</i>

66
00:28:23,496 --> 00:28:27,500
<i>See, I am your MC
And I'd like to say what's good</i>

67
00:28:27,667 --> 00:28:30,170
<i>Drosselmeyer's spinnin' records
But she's also spinning time</i>

68
00:28:30,337 --> 00:28:32,255
<i>She got the flow while I got the rhymes</i>

69
00:28:32,339 --> 00:28:34,507
{\an8}<i>Keeps your eyes open
And your fists bumpin'</i>

70
00:28:34,591 --> 00:28:36,301
{\an8}<i>There's magic on the dance floor</i>

71
00:28:36,635 --> 00:28:38,803
<i>So keep the rhythm bumpin'
And your feet jumpin'</i>

72
00:28:38,929 --> 00:28:40,597
{\an8}<i>To find what you're looking for</i>

73
00:28:40,931 --> 00:28:43,016
<i>Put your hands up
It's time to take it back</i>

74
00:28:43,141 --> 00:28:45,560
<i>Let's dance, DJ, spin that track</i>

75
00:28:50,023 --> 00:28:55,278
<i>The correct spelling
of sweet is S-W-E-E-T.</i>

76
00:30:03,596 --> 00:30:07,475
Yeah!

77
00:30:18,570 --> 00:30:19,571
Go!

78
00:30:22,073 --> 00:30:25,702
<i>Get up, get up, get up, get up</i>

79
00:30:29,873 --> 00:30:33,543
<i>Get up, get up, get up, get up</i>

80
00:30:37,672 --> 00:30:40,467
<i>Get up, get up, get up</i>

81
00:30:46,097 --> 00:30:47,223
<i>Party</i>

82
00:30:48,141 --> 00:30:49,142
<i>Party</i>

83
00:30:50,143 --> 00:30:51,144
<i>Party</i>

84
00:30:52,062 --> 00:30:53,104
<i>Party</i>

85
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:14,820
<i>Ladies and gentlemen.</i>

86
00:31:15,085 --> 00:31:16,127
<i>Yeah!</i>

87
00:31:54,749 --> 00:31:58,795
Yeah!

88
00:32:03,967 --> 00:32:05,468
{\an8}<i>Can I have some candy?</i>

89
00:32:19,899 --> 00:32:21,067
Yeah!

90
00:35:27,754 --> 00:35:31,924
<i>Yo, yo, get back to what you got to do
When time's runnin' out</i>

91
00:35:32,008 --> 00:35:35,511
<i>You don't want to lose it
Mission is clear, but you gotta move fast</i>

92
00:35:35,678 --> 00:35:37,680
<i>Fix their future, learn from their past</i>

93
00:35:37,805 --> 00:35:39,932
{\an8}<i>The dance is the key
Now you're up to speed</i>

94
00:35:40,058 --> 00:35:41,976
<i>Finally, now you got what you need</i>

95
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:44,354
{\an8}<i>It's almost midnight
The clock's gonna chime</i>

96
00:35:44,479 --> 00:35:46,522
<i>Hurry up now, you can make it in time</i>

97
00:35:46,648 --> 00:35:48,858
<i>Make it in time, make it in time</i>

98
00:35:48,941 --> 00:35:51,569
<i>The dance is the key
You can make it in time</i>

99
00:39:01,634 --> 00:39:07,056
Ten, nine, eight, seven,

100
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:13,062
six, five, four, three,

101
00:39:13,688 --> 00:39:16,357
two, one.

102
00:39:16,858 --> 00:39:23,155
Happy New Year!

103
00:39:38,379 --> 00:39:42,049
<i>Yeah, now, we're back on the block
Where we got our start</i>

104
00:39:42,174 --> 00:39:45,011
{\an8}<i>Now things are looking better
Now we got the heart</i>

105
00:39:45,261 --> 00:39:48,097
{\an8}<i>I hope you had fun
'Cause we had a ball</i>

106
00:39:48,431 --> 00:39:51,100
{\an8}<i>When we work together
Love conquers all</i>

107
00:39:51,350 --> 00:39:54,145
<i>Holidays are a time
For magic and to catch up</i>

108
00:39:54,312 --> 00:39:57,023
<i>With family and friends
They give you lessons to pick up</i>

109
00:39:57,106 --> 00:40:00,151
<i>Like sometimes you can find love
On the dance floor</i>

110
00:40:00,234 --> 00:40:03,154
<i>And sometimes you got to go back
To go forward</i>

111
00:40:03,321 --> 00:40:05,990
<i>Community, they got your back
No matter the weather</i>

112
00:40:06,073 --> 00:40:08,826
<i>Even through tough times
Movement brings us together</i>

113
00:40:08,951 --> 00:40:12,079
<i>So everybody on your feet
You got one more chance</i>

114
00:40:12,163 --> 00:40:15,291
<i>Now, shut this block down
Everybody, let's dance</i>

115
00:41:50,970 --> 00:41:54,849
<i>Everybody, gather around
Strike a pose, give a look, what a time</i>

116
00:41:54,932 --> 00:41:57,351
<i>Another New Year's Eve is in the books</i>

117
00:41:57,643 --> 00:41:59,520
Happy holidays, y'all.

118
00:42:02,773 --> 00:42:06,444
{\an8}<i>Clap your hands, everybody
If you got what it takes</i>

119
00:42:06,652 --> 00:42:08,821
<i>'Cause I'm Kurtis Blow
And y'all need to know</i>

120
00:42:08,946 --> 00:42:11,032
<i>That these are the breaks</i>

121
00:42:19,832 --> 00:42:23,836
<i>Brakes on a bus, brakes on a car
Breaks to make you a superstar</i>

122
00:42:24,045 --> 00:42:27,923
{\an8}<i>Breaks to win and breaks to lose
These here breaks to rock your shoes</i>

123
00:42:28,049 --> 00:42:32,636
<i>And these are the breaks
Break it up, break it up, break it up...</i>

124
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:47,318
<i>...If your woman steps out
With another man</i>

125
00:42:47,443 --> 00:42:49,195
<i>That's the breaks, that's the breaks</i>

126
00:42:49,278 --> 00:42:51,614
<i>And she runs off with him to Japan</i>

127
00:42:51,697 --> 00:42:53,377
<i>That's the breaks, that's the breaks</i>

128
00:42:53,491 --> 00:42:55,910
{\an8}<i>And the IRS says they wanna chat</i>

129
00:42:56,035 --> 00:42:57,679
<i>That's the breaks, that's the breaks</i>

130
00:42:57,703 --> 00:43:00,039
<i>And you can't explain
why you claimed the cat</i>

131
00:43:00,164 --> 00:43:02,083
<i>That's the breaks, that's the breaks</i>

132
00:43:02,208 --> 00:43:04,335
<i>And Ma Bell sends you
A whoppin' bill</i>

133
00:43:04,502 --> 00:43:06,295
<i>That's the breaks, that's the breaks</i>

134
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:08,589
<i>With 18 phone calls to Brazil</i>

135
00:43:08,714 --> 00:43:10,358
<i>That's the breaks, that's the breaks</i>

136
00:43:10,382 --> 00:43:12,885
<i>And you borrowed money
From the mob</i>

137
00:43:12,968 --> 00:43:14,762
<i>That's the breaks, that's the breaks</i>

138
00:43:14,929 --> 00:43:17,056
<i>And yesterday
You lost your job, baby</i>

139
00:43:17,181 --> 00:43:18,492
<i>That's the breaks, that's the breaks</i>

140
00:43:18,516 --> 00:43:21,227
<i>Oh, well
Well, these are the breaks</i>

141
00:43:21,310 --> 00:43:23,813
<i>Break it up, break it up, break it up...</i>

142
00:43:32,071 --> 00:43:36,033
<i>...Brakes on a train, brakes on a plane
Breaks to make you go insane</i>

143
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:38,244
<i>Breaks in love, breaks in war</i>

144
00:43:38,410 --> 00:43:40,287
<i>We got the breaks
To get you on the floor</i>

145
00:43:40,412 --> 00:43:42,289
<i>And these are the breaks</i>

146
00:43:42,498 --> 00:43:45,042
<i>Break it up, break it up, break it up
Break down...</i>

147
00:43:56,220 --> 00:43:57,596
<i>...Break it up, break down</i>
