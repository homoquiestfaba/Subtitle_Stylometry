to slow down while you eat.

She won't talk about it.

415

She probably has good reason.

[Exhales sharply]

714
01:14:16,743 --> 01:14:17,618
[Woman screams]

715
01:14:17,744 --> 01:14:19,078
MAN: Oh, shit!

716
01:14:27,421 --> 01:14:30,214
MAN: We need everybody
to clear out of this area.

717
01:14:30,424 --> 01:14:34,010
[Siren wailing,
indistinct conversations]

718
01:14:37,639 --> 01:14:38,473
Iris!

719
01:14:39,433 --> 01:14:41,100
What did mama tell you
to do right now?

720
01:14:41,226 --> 01:14:43,227
When face to face
with a policeman,

721
01:14:43,353 --> 01:14:47,023
I should keep my mouth shut,
say nothing unless asked,

722
01:14:47,149 --> 01:14:49,609
answer questions
with "yes, sir, no, sir,"

723
01:14:49,860 --> 01:14:51,986
unless they violate
my civil rights.

724
01:14:52,321 --> 01:14:56,657
Then put my hands on my hand
where they can clearly see them

725
01:14:56,783 --> 01:14:59,452
and ask for a lawyer
and never make sudden moves

726
01:15:00,245 --> 01:15:01,537
and never get angry.

727
01:15:03,165 --> 01:15:07,210
What were you doing in the kitchen?
What were you doing in the kitchen?!

728
01:15:07,336 --> 01:15:09,462
Marcus! Move!

729
01:15:09,588 --> 01:15:12,632
What are you doing here?
What did you do? What did you do?

730
01:15:12,758 --> 01:15:14,675
You gotta get out.
You gotta go out the back door, go.

731
01:15:14,801 --> 01:15:16,052
-Mom, please--
-No, shh!

732
01:15:16,178 --> 01:15:17,803
-Where am I supposed to go?
-I don't know!

733
01:15:17,930 --> 01:15:20,431
[Pounding on door]
You're supposed to help me!

734
01:15:20,557 --> 01:15:22,391
-Please, Ma!
-No! Stop! Shit!

735
01:15:22,476 --> 01:15:23,601
Wait, wait! Wait, wait!

736
01:15:23,727 --> 01:15:24,310
[Pounding continues]

737
01:15:24,436 --> 01:15:25,686
Shit!

738
01:15:27,231 --> 01:15:27,939
Pattie?

739
01:15:28,065 --> 01:15:32,401
Okay, after this,
I do not ever want to see you again.

740
01:15:32,528 --> 01:15:33,319
Go.

741
01:15:33,445 --> 01:15:35,071
[Pounding continues]

742
01:15:35,405 --> 01:15:36,989
Pattie!

743
01:15:40,577 --> 01:15:41,702
I need to search your house, Pattie.

744
01:15:41,828 --> 01:15:43,162
It's just me and Iris.

745
01:15:43,288 --> 01:15:45,498
Look, I want to find out
who's responsible for this.

746
01:15:45,624 --> 01:15:46,916
Responsible for what?

747
01:15:47,042 --> 01:15:48,668
A cop is dead!

748
01:15:50,087 --> 01:15:52,296
This is fucking critical!

749
01:15:52,798 --> 01:15:56,008
I'm very sorry
about your police officer,

750
01:15:56,134 --> 01:15:57,969
but I don't know
anything about it.

751
01:15:58,095 --> 01:15:59,595
So unless we're under martial law,

752
01:15:59,721 --> 01:16:01,222
you're gonna need a warrant
to get in here.

753
01:16:07,312 --> 01:16:09,647
What the fuck you looking at?

754
01:16:09,773 --> 01:16:12,567
Fuck you!
I ain't gotta answer to you!

755
01:16:13,235 --> 01:16:14,652
Fuck you!

756
01:16:14,778 --> 01:16:17,405
[Siren wailing, indistinct
chatter on police radio]

757
01:16:19,491 --> 01:16:22,034
MAN: Hey, ?en! Gordon!
We need you over here now!

758
01:16:22,160 --> 01:16:23,411
I'll be back.

759
01:16:23,870 --> 01:16:27,623
WOMAN: Harassing us again.
Get out of our neighborhood!

760
01:16:37,509 --> 01:16:42,305
I want you to go out that back door
and don't come back.

761
01:16:48,687 --> 01:16:51,606
[Sirens wailing]

762
01:16:56,612 --> 01:16:58,321
Iris, Iris, come here.

763
01:16:58,447 --> 01:17:00,364
-Police! Police! Open the door!
-It's gonna be okay.

764
01:17:00,490 --> 01:17:01,991
-Let's get this over with.
-Police!

765
01:17:02,117 --> 01:17:03,034
Police, open up!

766
01:17:03,160 --> 01:17:03,868
[Shotgun cocking]

767
01:17:03,994 --> 01:17:05,119
Open up!

768
01:17:05,245 --> 01:17:06,662
[Thudding on door]
Stand back!

769
01:17:06,788 --> 01:17:08,914
You stay close to me,
you don't say a word.

770
01:17:09,041 --> 01:17:10,833
Police! Open up!

771
01:17:11,209 --> 01:17:12,126
[All shouting]

772
01:17:12,628 --> 01:17:14,545
Get down, baby, shh.

773
01:17:15,047 --> 01:17:17,131
[Shouting continues]
Get down! Get down!

774
01:17:17,257 --> 01:17:18,716
Get your hands in the air, now!

775
01:17:18,842 --> 01:17:19,967
Shh, shh, it's okay.

776
01:17:20,093 --> 01:17:21,552
Get down on the ground now!

777
01:17:21,928 --> 01:17:23,721
[Handcuffs click, Marcus groans]

778
01:17:23,847 --> 01:17:25,723
Ohh! Aah! Agh!

779
01:17:28,018 --> 01:17:30,770
[Siren wailing in distance]

780
01:18:06,973 --> 01:18:09,684
[Indistinct chatter on police radio]

781
01:18:27,703 --> 01:18:29,161
[Tires screech]

782
01:19:09,703 --> 01:19:11,370
[Gunshots, thud]

783
01:19:11,496 --> 01:19:13,748
[Gunshots]

784
01:19:31,767 --> 01:19:34,185
[Patricia crying]

785
01:21:51,740 --> 01:21:55,034
-Job came up.
-Hmm.

786
01:21:55,160 --> 01:21:56,785
It's a good job.

787
01:21:58,121 --> 01:22:00,164
I was gonna tell you.

788
01:22:03,668 --> 01:22:07,838
I told the guy if it came through,
I'd come back.

789
01:22:07,964 --> 01:22:10,132
It came through.

790
01:22:12,886 --> 01:22:14,595
Probably should have
told you before,

791
01:22:14,721 --> 01:22:20,142
but I'd like it if you and Iris
could come with me.

792
01:22:27,108 --> 01:22:30,069
We're never gonna
be happy here, are we?

793
01:22:34,699 --> 01:22:36,617
I can't go with you.

794
01:22:37,410 --> 01:22:39,578
I can't stay.

795
01:22:42,082 --> 01:22:45,793
'Cause this is not the life
you want to live.

796
01:22:54,094 --> 01:22:56,553
Because I want more.

797
01:22:57,389 --> 01:22:59,765
For both of us.

798
01:23:01,267 --> 01:23:03,978
But all you have to do
is call me, Pattie.

799
01:23:04,938 --> 01:23:07,272
Whenever you're ready.

800
01:23:20,370 --> 01:23:22,663
See you later.

801
01:23:38,263 --> 01:23:40,055
What about your TV?

802
01:23:41,766 --> 01:23:44,226
Keep it. It's yours.

803
01:23:46,354 --> 01:23:47,980
You sure?

804
01:23:48,440 --> 01:23:50,441
Why not?

805
01:24:05,290 --> 01:24:07,416
Good-bye, Marcus.
