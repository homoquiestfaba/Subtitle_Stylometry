You are all nothing
 but worm meat.

You are not good enough
 to eat out of a dog's dish

 something of yourselves!

[LAUGHS] I-- I--

13
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:05,770
I was always wondering why
 I could never achieve any

of my dreams, why
 everything I ever wanted

15
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:12,520
was always just sort of,
 like, out of my reach.

16
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:13,220
Why?

17
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:23,740
Because I was then
 what you are now--

00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:27,670

 makes a difference?

I know PhDs that serve me my
 burgers at Jack in the Box.

You think being the next
 person makes a difference?

 get the political updates

 stopped to think

 something only I would know?

706
00:34:59,370 --> 00:35:00,830
You like men with hairy backs.

707
00:35:00,830 --> 00:35:01,650
Oh, lucky guess.

708
00:35:01,650 --> 00:35:03,720
Your first boyfriend
 liked to pee in the pool.

709
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:04,630
A lot of men do that!

710
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:05,790
He did it from
 the diving board!

711
00:35:05,790 --> 00:35:07,500
Look, I've had enough of this!

712
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:08,850
Sometimes, during
 sex, you like to be

713
00:35:08,850 --> 00:35:09,770
tied up and called "Toby!"

714
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:13,810
I don't do that anymore!

715
00:35:20,050 --> 00:35:22,300
- Melanie?
 - Yes!

716
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:30,330
You look so frosty.

717
00:35:30,330 --> 00:35:31,260
I know.

718
00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:40,940
You've got blond hair and--

719
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:43,060
what big blue eyes you've got.

720
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:43,940
Came with the package.

721
00:35:48,210 --> 00:35:51,090
You got pink nipples
 down there too?

722
00:35:51,090 --> 00:35:53,610
The whole package.

723
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:55,600
What kind of
 crazy shit is this?

724
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,540
I'm just as
 baffled as you are.

725
00:35:57,540 --> 00:35:59,010
I went out to dinner
 last night with Dave.

726
00:35:59,010 --> 00:35:59,810
I didn't feel well.

727
00:35:59,810 --> 00:36:02,600
I came home and went to bed
 and I woke up this morning

728
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:04,210
and I'm Heather Locklear!

729
00:36:04,210 --> 00:36:05,580
Oh.

730
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:07,800
What seems to be the problem?

731
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:10,140
Well, this is
 kind of weird, Doc,

732
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:16,530
but my friend Melanie here,
 she has, um, a skin condition.

733
00:36:16,530 --> 00:36:17,230
SKIN DOCTOR: Oh?

734
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:33,940
And what exactly is wrong
 with your skin, dear?

735
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:34,640
It's white.

736
00:36:38,210 --> 00:36:40,100
Yes.

737
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:40,870
Yes, it is.

738
00:36:40,870 --> 00:36:43,120
Well, it ain't
 always been white.

739
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:48,110
Oh, what color
 has it always been?

740
00:36:48,110 --> 00:36:49,760
- Our color?
 - Our color?

741
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,660
Yes, yours and mine.

742
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:52,670
Yours and mine?

743
00:36:52,670 --> 00:36:56,380
You know, black,
 brown, chocolate, uh,

744
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:58,940
coffee, mahogany, Tootsie Roll.

745
00:36:58,940 --> 00:36:59,910
Show him.

746
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:13,530
Now have you ever seen
 anything like that?

747
00:37:13,530 --> 00:37:16,340
And this happened
 to her overnight.

748
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:17,960
This has gone far enough.

749
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:19,460
I think it's time
 you left my office.

750
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:20,390
TESS: Wait a minute, Doctor!

751
00:37:20,390 --> 00:37:21,370
Listen to me!

752
00:37:21,370 --> 00:37:23,450
Something happened to
 her to make her change!

753
00:37:23,450 --> 00:37:25,180
And we came to you for help!

754
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:27,440
Look, I've know Melanie
 now for 15 years.

755
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,250
And I'm telling you,
 she is no Madonna.

756
00:37:46,290 --> 00:37:46,990
Smile.

757
00:37:53,530 --> 00:37:57,470
You're telling me
 that this is that?

758
00:37:57,470 --> 00:37:58,170
Yeah.

759
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:19,870
Any albinos in your family?

760
00:38:19,870 --> 00:38:21,970
No.

761
00:38:21,970 --> 00:38:24,130
Anemia?

762
00:38:24,130 --> 00:38:26,010
Whooping cough?

763
00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:28,420
Any relation to Michael Jackson?

764
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:30,610
Why are you fondling her hair?

765
00:38:30,610 --> 00:38:33,520
I mean, what are you, getting
 off on this or something, Doc?

766
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:36,550
Are you questioning my
 technique, Ms. Peterson?

767
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:38,520
Maybe you would like to
 hang your medical diploma

768
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:40,960
on the wall?
 - Come on, Doc.

769
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:43,050
Whooping cough?

770
00:38:43,050 --> 00:38:46,080
Well, it-- it's possible
 that a strong cough may

771
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:48,420
have altered the pigmentation.

772
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:50,040
That is the dumbest
 thing I ever heard.

773
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:52,260
Oh, and I suppose hearing
 a black girl turning white

774
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:55,850
overnight is straight out
 of "Good Housekeeping."

775
00:38:55,850 --> 00:38:58,220
It's not his fault.
 You have to admit,

776
00:38:58,220 --> 00:39:01,500
this is the most bizarre thing
 that ever happened to a person.

777
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:03,740
Come on, sugar.

778
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:06,650
I'm gonna buy you some lunch to
 take your mind off of it, OK?

779
00:39:06,650 --> 00:39:09,040
There's a "Black Angus"
 right around the corner.

780
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:09,740
Sorry.

781
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:25,280
God, this is really
 freaking me out.

782
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,200
Look how bright I
 am in the sunlight.

783
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,120
This is hurting my eyes.

784
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:30,270
And it can't be any
 good for my retinas.

785
00:39:30,270 --> 00:39:31,120
And look at my skirt!

786
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:33,670
I'm going to have to take all
 my clothes in in the butt.

787
00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:36,120
Excuse me, ladies.

788
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:36,930
What?

789
00:39:36,930 --> 00:39:38,890
You both just jaywalked
 across the street.

790
00:39:38,890 --> 00:39:40,570
So?
 There ain't no traffic.

791
00:39:40,570 --> 00:39:43,240
Jaywalking's illegal whether
 there's traffic or not.

792
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:45,070
Oh, give me a break.

793
00:39:45,070 --> 00:39:46,490
Another ticket?

794
00:39:46,490 --> 00:39:48,770
I didn't get this many
 tickets when I had a car.

795
00:39:48,770 --> 00:39:50,650
Could I see some ID, please?

796
00:39:50,650 --> 00:39:53,500
So my podiatry rates
 are going to go up now?

797
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:55,180
Does this mean I have
 to go to walking school

798
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:57,250
to get this off my record?

799
00:39:57,250 --> 00:39:58,540
What if I don't pay this?

800
00:39:58,540 --> 00:40:00,640
Are you gonna come to my
 house and impound my shoes?

801
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:02,040
Tess, stop it!

802
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:05,580
She's-- she's just been taking
 this assertiveness course.

803
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:06,310
Your ID, ma'am?

804
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:12,600
I don't have my ID with me.

805
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:14,100
You don't?

806
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:15,390
No.

807
00:40:15,390 --> 00:40:17,610
You should always carry
 your ID with you, miss.

808
00:40:17,610 --> 00:40:18,750
I know, it's just--

809
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:20,790
it's just, I left in
 a hurry this morning.

810
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,940
What's your name?

811
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:28,070
Melanie Welles.

812
00:40:28,070 --> 00:40:30,020
I'll tell you
 what, Miss Welles.

813
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:31,950
You promise not to jaywalk
 again and I'll let you

814
00:40:31,950 --> 00:40:34,820
and your friend go today
 with just a warning.

815
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:35,520
Thank you.

816
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:44,590
God, I've never gotten
 out of a ticket before.

817
00:40:44,590 --> 00:40:46,170
Me either.

818
00:40:46,170 --> 00:40:48,810
Mind if I check my messages?

819
00:40:48,810 --> 00:40:50,010
You know, it's
 incredible the way

820
00:40:50,010 --> 00:40:51,990
he just let us go like that.

821
00:40:51,990 --> 00:40:53,560
I mean, it was as though
 he was influenced--

822
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:54,900
[GASPS] Oh, my god.
 Dave called.

823
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:56,370
What am I going to tell him?

824
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:58,600
Tell him you had [INAUDIBLE].

825
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:00,160
He's never going
 to believe this.

826
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,190
I've got to tell him in person.

827
00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:16,700
Could we lighten
 it a bit more?

828
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:19,190
I'd like more lightning?
 - Sure.

829
00:41:19,190 --> 00:41:22,930
Don't you think lightening it
 more would make me look sexier?

830
00:41:22,930 --> 00:41:26,070
You look sexy
 whatever we do, Scrappy.

831
00:41:26,070 --> 00:41:27,530
Mm.

832
00:41:27,530 --> 00:41:29,770
Seems to be poofing out
 more than it should.

833
00:41:29,770 --> 00:41:31,760
Can-- can you lessen the poof?

834
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:34,160
Sure.

835
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:38,430
[MOANING]

836
00:41:38,430 --> 00:41:41,500
Oh, you do poof better
 than anyone I know.

837
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:42,940
- Uh-huh.
 - Mm.

838
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:43,910
Yes.

839
00:41:43,910 --> 00:41:44,870
Right there.

840
00:41:44,870 --> 00:41:46,790
Oh, yes.

841
00:41:46,790 --> 00:41:49,980
[SIGHS] I think I'm
 ready for a blow now.

842
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:51,120
How about you?

843
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:52,290
Not today, thanks.

844
00:41:55,970 --> 00:41:58,580
What are you
 doing after the cut?

845
00:41:58,580 --> 00:42:03,710
How-- how about we go back to my
 place and we play Head Banker?

846
00:42:03,710 --> 00:42:05,300
Head Banker?

847
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:07,100
And what would that be?

848
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:09,650
I open an account for you.

849
00:42:09,650 --> 00:42:12,860
We watch interest rates rise.

850
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:16,820
You make a few deposits
 and withdrawals.

851
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:18,960
And we close escrow.

852
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:20,960
[LAUGHS] I don't think so.

853
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:22,240
It's OK.

854
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:24,850
I'm FDIC approved.

855
00:42:24,850 --> 00:42:26,020
D-I-C, anyway.

856
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:26,830
Come on, Scrappy.

857
00:42:26,830 --> 00:42:29,540
You know we go through this
 every time you come in here.

858
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:32,450
You know I'm seeing somebody.
 - Well, so am I!

859
00:42:34,950 --> 00:42:36,860
[MOANING]

860
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:39,860
Don't make me have to call
 pest control, all right?

861
00:42:44,710 --> 00:42:46,080
Where's Dave?

862
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:47,760
I'm sorry, he's with
 a client right now.

863
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:48,680
Can I have your name?

864
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:49,920
For Christ's sakes,
 Jenny, it's me!

865
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:52,620
Have you been here before?

866
00:42:52,620 --> 00:42:53,450
I'm not here for a cut.

867
00:42:53,450 --> 00:42:55,040
I just need to
 show him something.

868
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:56,910
Oh!
 - Excuse me there, sweetheart.

869
00:42:56,910 --> 00:42:59,130
You know, sometimes, I get into
 the way and I don't know why.

870
00:42:59,130 --> 00:43:03,140
I try so hard to--
 to do the job and--

871
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:04,570
Go ahead.
 He's in station four.

872
00:43:04,570 --> 00:43:05,270
Thank you.

873
00:43:08,810 --> 00:43:10,890
Is she as good a kisser as me?

874
00:43:10,890 --> 00:43:12,600
No, you're the grand
 kisser of all time.

875
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:15,000
Now back off before I
 handcuff you to the chair, OK?

876
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,370
Ooh!

877
00:43:17,370 --> 00:43:19,410
Good cop, bad cop.

878
00:43:19,410 --> 00:43:21,270
That's even better
 than Head Banker!

879
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:27,500
That was fast.
 Did you see him?

880
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:29,410
Yeah, he was
 taking out the trash.

881
00:43:29,410 --> 00:43:32,670
I'll catch up with him later.

882

Could you pour some cold
 water on Scrappy Gerstel?

Are you OK?

888
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:47,750
Dave, it's me.

889

It is?

890
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:52,040
You know I wasn't
 this color last night.

891
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:54,200
You were here for a coloring?

892

Let me start again, Dave.
 It's me.

I hope I didn't
 scare you in there.

I think you made me ruin another

 to you privately?

Hang on.

Uh, Scrappy, go
 back to your chair.

899
00:44:08,350 --> 00:44:10,580
I'm going to poke the
 air out of your lips, OK?

900
00:44:10,580 --> 00:44:11,540
Don't be too long.

901
00:44:11,540 --> 00:44:12,770
You wouldn't want me to dry out.

902
00:44:12,770 --> 00:44:15,770
Maybe we can go back and sample
 my own personal cream rinse.

903
00:44:15,770 --> 00:44:17,780
Scrappy, go!

904
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:19,280
Sit!

905
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:21,980
Woof.

She's something, isn't she?
 Where were we again?

Is this what goes
 on here all day long?

919
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:42,950
You've never acted
 like this when

920
00:44:42,950 --> 00:44:45,140
I've come to see you before.

921
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:46,190
Do you know me?

922
00:44:46,190 --> 00:44:47,240
I thought I did.

923
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:48,320
I'm a little confused.

I'm with a client right
 now, though, gorgeous,

 finish with her soon,

I'm going to have to
 Scotchgard that chair.

934
00:45:07,620 --> 00:45:11,250

935
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:12,720
Uh, give me about 20 minutes.

00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:14,870
There's a cafe
 around the corner.

937
00:45:14,870 --> 00:45:16,170
And I'll meet you
 there when I'm done.

 how to tell you this.

Really glad you
 made it so soon.

Scrappy gave up a little
 quicker than I thought.

948
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:54,310
So how do you know me?

949
00:45:54,310 --> 00:45:56,030
And what can I do for you?

00:45:56,030 --> 00:45:57,080
Look, Dave.

I know my face may not
 seem familiar to you.

And it's the most perfect
 face I've ever seen.

00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:23,770
Like, why'd you come see me?

963
00:46:23,770 --> 00:46:24,700
What's this all about?

00:46:24,700 --> 00:46:25,660
Wait a minute.

 perfect about my face.

Open the door or I'll
 stay here all night long

 Dean Martin tunes.

 give me a minute.

1425

 Sorry.

Terrific.

You know, I think
 straight talk is

01:06:28,500 --> 01:06:30,510
the best kind of talk there is.

1437
01:06:30,510 --> 01:06:32,640
Too many people are
 into this curvy talk.

 - Does it show?

You know I'm not a bullshitter.

1443
01:06:51,500 --> 01:06:54,350
I always felt that
 the best approach

1444
01:06:54,350 --> 01:06:56,390
was the honest approach.

 that's just what

You know, it's not exactly

1460
01:07:33,410 --> 01:07:34,840
You know, she
 approached me at the salon

1461
01:07:34,840 --> 01:07:36,710
and started coming onto me.

1462

I have no interest in her!

1463
01:07:38,260 --> 01:07:39,950
She was coming onto you.

1464
01:07:39,950 --> 01:07:41,470
I only went out with
 her because you've

1465
01:07:41,470 --> 01:07:43,810
been avoiding me all week.

1466
01:07:43,810 --> 01:07:46,120
I think my meeting
 her was sort of--

1467
01:07:46,120 --> 01:07:48,340
was like some kind of
 divine intervention.

1468
01:07:48,340 --> 01:07:53,210
She came in and out of
 my life for a reason.

1469

And that reason was to
 show me how much I miss you

1470
01:07:56,690 --> 01:07:57,710
and love you.

1471
01:08:03,070 --> 01:08:10,260
Melanie, let's start
 over again, OK?

1472
01:08:10,260 --> 01:08:12,730
No lies.

 OK?

No words.

You did it with that
 shit all over your face?

1477
01:08:49,880 --> 01:08:51,540
It was quite a mess.

TESS: He couldn't
 tell the difference?

1479

 didn't notice your hair?

1480
01:08:54,930 --> 01:08:57,030
He never took the
 towel off my head.

It was so wonderful, Tess.

He had never been so romantic.

1486
01:09:09,500 --> 01:09:15,650
I mean, he actually told me
 he loved me, and he meant it.

1487
01:09:15,650 --> 01:09:16,820
You know, I don't
 know why you're

1488
01:09:16,820 --> 01:09:19,850
gonna let him back in your life
 after the way he treated you.

1489
01:09:19,850 --> 01:09:21,590
He wanted me.

1490
01:09:21,590 --> 01:09:23,510
And actually, I think the
 whole thing was some sort

1491
01:09:23,510 --> 01:09:27,440
of divine intervention.

Divine intervention.

1494
01:09:31,330 --> 01:09:35,150
I prayed for Dave to love
 me and-- and now, he does.

1495
01:09:35,150 --> 01:09:37,550
I mean, he really wants me now.

1496

Of course he's going
 to want the black you

1497
01:09:39,440 --> 01:09:41,180
after the white you dumped him.

1498
01:09:41,180 --> 01:09:42,200
What did you expect?

1499
01:09:42,200 --> 01:09:43,740
He pursued Melanie.

1500
01:09:43,740 --> 01:09:45,080

1501

Melanie, not Ivory.

Hey, moron.

1504

You won by default.

You're just jealous.

Anyway, I'm meeting
 him tomorrow and I'm

And then it won't

You honestly believe
 he loves you or Ivory?

1510
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:03,500
You didn't see him
 last night, Tess.

1511

OK.

Before you tell him
 the truth, tell him

you had second thoughts
 and you want him back.

And then if he loves
 you, he'll tell Ivory

01:13:46,860 --> 01:13:49,300
Was that good for you, baby?

1586
01:13:49,300 --> 01:13:51,430
It was great.

1587
01:13:51,430 --> 01:13:52,660
Well, what were
 you thinking about?

1588
01:13:55,890 --> 01:13:58,480
I was thinking about you.

1589
01:13:58,480 --> 01:14:00,160
Were you really?

1590
01:14:00,160 --> 01:14:03,400
Because, uh, it seemed like
 you were a little distracted.

1591
01:14:03,400 --> 01:14:05,540
No.
 No, I was-- I was fine.

1592
01:14:09,370 --> 01:14:11,720
It's my friend Melanie.

1593
01:14:11,720 --> 01:14:14,610
You were thinking
 about her, weren't you?

1594
01:14:14,610 --> 01:14:16,330
Who's Melanie?

1595
01:14:16,330 --> 01:14:17,700
The blonde that was
 here the other day.

1596
01:14:17,700 --> 01:14:20,530
Don't tell me you
 don't remember.

1597
01:14:20,530 --> 01:14:22,940
Tess, why would I be
 thinking about her?

1598
01:14:22,940 --> 01:14:26,440
Because she's
 blonde and white.

1599
01:14:26,440 --> 01:14:28,650
That's the craziest
 thing I've ever heard!

1600
01:14:28,650 --> 01:14:30,430
We've never talked about
 your last relationship.

1601
01:14:30,430 --> 01:14:31,470
Was she white too?

1602
01:14:31,470 --> 01:14:33,210
I don't think that
 really matters, but no.

1603
01:14:36,050 --> 01:14:37,100
Really?

1604
01:14:37,100 --> 01:14:39,350
Really.

1605
01:14:39,350 --> 01:14:41,050
[CHUCKLES] I'm sorry.

1606
01:14:41,050 --> 01:14:44,510
[CHUCKLES] I guess I was
 just a little suspicious.

1607
01:14:44,510 --> 01:14:48,280
I mean, my last boyfriend
 dumped me for a white girl.

1608
01:14:48,280 --> 01:14:49,850
Sorry to hear that.

1609
01:14:49,850 --> 01:14:51,980
Yeah, and to top it
 off, my girlfriend gets

1610
01:14:51,980 --> 01:14:54,700
dumped for a white girl too.

1611
01:14:54,700 --> 01:14:55,400
Really?

1612
01:14:55,400 --> 01:14:56,630
Who ?

1613
01:14:56,630 --> 01:14:58,390
Melanie

1614
01:14:58,390 --> 01:15:01,400
No, I mean the black
 girl who got dumped.

1615
01:15:01,400 --> 01:15:02,100
Melanie.

1616
01:15:04,810 --> 01:15:08,220
[KNOCKING]

1617
01:15:15,210 --> 01:15:15,910
Hey!

1618
01:15:19,650 --> 01:15:20,590
Hey!

1619
01:15:20,590 --> 01:15:23,570
What are you doing here?

1620
01:15:23,570 --> 01:15:25,020
Where am I?

1621
01:15:25,020 --> 01:15:26,080
This isn't my apartment.

1622
01:15:26,080 --> 01:15:27,330
Don't-- don't-- don't do this.

1623
01:15:27,330 --> 01:15:29,490
I'm in no mood for any
 more of your bullshit.

1624
01:15:29,490 --> 01:15:31,080
I want to know what's
 going on with you two,

1625
01:15:31,080 --> 01:15:32,460
and I want to know now.

1626
01:15:32,460 --> 01:15:33,880
I don't know what
 you're talking about.

1627
01:15:33,880 --> 01:15:35,240
Oh, really?

1628
01:15:35,240 --> 01:15:39,360
Here, how about I put it
 in writing for you, huh?

1629
01:15:39,360 --> 01:15:41,130
You tell me how
 Melanie Welles's ticket

1630
01:15:41,130 --> 01:15:42,590
found its way into your purse.

1631
01:15:42,590 --> 01:15:43,890
And while you're
 working on that little

1632
01:15:43,890 --> 01:15:46,080
lie, why don't you tell me
 why your name's not listed

1633
01:15:46,080 --> 01:15:49,110
on the apartment directory,
 why the manager there has never

1634
01:15:49,110 --> 01:15:51,510
heard of you, why you're
 not listed in any telephone

1635
01:15:51,510 --> 01:15:53,770
book, why you're not
 registered at the DMV,

1636
01:15:53,770 --> 01:15:56,820
and why you don't have a
 social security number.

1637
01:15:56,820 --> 01:15:57,930
You've been busy.

1638
01:15:57,930 --> 01:15:58,740
Who are you?

1639
01:15:58,740 --> 01:15:59,790
I mean, what do you do?

1640
01:15:59,790 --> 01:16:00,960
Who are your friends?

1641
01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:04,000
Why did you come up
 to me in the salon?

1642
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,240
I mean, I know
 nothing about you.

1643
01:16:06,240 --> 01:16:08,070
Yeah, you know
 nothing about me.

1644
01:16:08,070 --> 01:16:09,480
And yet you fell for me.

1645
01:16:09,480 --> 01:16:10,840
Pretty weird, huh?

1646
01:16:10,840 --> 01:16:12,170
Fell for you?

1647
01:16:12,170 --> 01:16:14,090
Where did you get this
 "fell for you" thing?

1648
01:16:14,090 --> 01:16:15,770
You asked me out
 the first day we met.

1649
01:16:15,770 --> 01:16:17,570
You kissed me in
 your parked car.

1650
01:16:17,570 --> 01:16:21,830
And yesterday, you told me
 I'm the only one for you.

1651
01:16:21,830 --> 01:16:27,100
I had two tickets to a show,
 I made a big mistake in my car,

1652
01:16:27,100 --> 01:16:29,750
and I said you were the only one
 for me to get you off my back,

1653
01:16:29,750 --> 01:16:30,980
not to mention my lap.

1654
01:16:30,980 --> 01:16:33,620
Yeah, but you wanted
 me and you know it.

1655
01:16:33,620 --> 01:16:35,960
You just couldn't resist
 my soft, white skin and

1656
01:16:35,960 --> 01:16:39,170
my long, flowing blonde hair.

1657
01:16:39,170 --> 01:16:41,610
You gotta be the most
 conceited person I know.

1658
01:16:41,610 --> 01:16:43,590
I mean, I've met
 actresses with less egos.

1659
01:16:43,590 --> 01:16:45,270
Don't give me this
 "holier than thou" shit.

1660
01:16:45,270 --> 01:16:46,940
I'm this way because of you.

1661
01:16:46,940 --> 01:16:48,500
You're what way because of me?

1662
01:16:48,500 --> 01:16:49,540
You didn't love me--

1663
01:16:49,540 --> 01:16:50,750
I mean Melanie.

1664
01:16:50,750 --> 01:16:53,350
She was just your little black
 toy until something white

1665
01:16:53,350 --> 01:16:54,050
came along.

1666
01:16:54,050 --> 01:16:56,450
And when I did, you
 just tossed her aside.

1667
01:16:56,450 --> 01:16:57,890
I never tossed anyone aside.

1668
01:16:57,890 --> 01:16:59,710
You just want me because
 I'm gorgeous and white.

1669
01:16:59,710 --> 01:17:00,500
Admit it.

1670
01:17:00,500 --> 01:17:02,840
You are so full of yourself,
 it's incredibly sickening.

1671
01:17:02,840 --> 01:17:04,370
Oh, and you're not?

1672
01:17:04,370 --> 01:17:05,690
You don't know
 anything about me.

1673
01:17:05,690 --> 01:17:07,370
I know you're someone
 who has to have the best

1674
01:17:07,370 --> 01:17:09,080
of everything--
 the best clothes,

1675
01:17:09,080 --> 01:17:12,590
the best cars, the best women.

1676
01:17:12,590 --> 01:17:14,600
You categorize yourself
 as one of the best women?

1677
01:17:14,600 --> 01:17:16,220
You do too.

1678
01:17:16,220 --> 01:17:20,520
And you put Melanie in a class
 below that because she's black?

1679
01:17:20,520 --> 01:17:21,860
You do that too.

1680
01:17:21,860 --> 01:17:24,400
Don't even put
 me in your league!

1681
01:17:24,400 --> 01:17:26,210
I mean, I don't know if
 she put you up to this

1682
01:17:26,210 --> 01:17:30,080
or if you're some sort
 of freelance bitch.

1683
01:17:30,080 --> 01:17:32,330
But you and Melanie
 can both go to hell.

1684
01:17:32,330 --> 01:17:34,040
You know what?
 Fine.

1685
01:17:34,040 --> 01:17:35,090
We don't need you.

1686
01:17:35,090 --> 01:17:36,410
I sure as hell don't.

1687
01:17:36,410 --> 01:17:39,050
The way I look, I can
 get any man like that.

1688
01:17:42,570 --> 01:17:45,540
Well, there's no
 doubt about that.

1689
01:17:45,540 --> 01:17:49,680
But let me give you a
 little reality injection.

1690
01:17:49,680 --> 01:17:51,660
You may be beautiful,
 sweetheart,

1691
01:17:51,660 --> 01:17:53,610
but you're the ugliest
 woman I ever met.

1692
01:17:59,930 --> 01:18:01,900
Yeah, he said his last
 relationship was black,

1693
01:18:01,900 --> 01:18:03,880
but I don't know
 if I believe him.

1694
01:18:03,880 --> 01:18:05,500
MELANIE: Why wouldn't
 you believe him?

1695
01:18:05,500 --> 01:18:07,260
Because I don't think
 he's into black women.

1696
01:18:07,260 --> 01:18:09,380
Why do you think that?

1697
01:18:09,380 --> 01:18:13,070
Well, when we were making
 love late last night,

1698
01:18:13,070 --> 01:18:15,880
he was fantasizing
 about somebody else.

1699
01:18:15,880 --> 01:18:18,670
I can tell when they do that.
 I don't know.

1700
01:18:18,670 --> 01:18:20,020
Maybe it was his sex.

1701
01:18:20,020 --> 01:18:21,850
And I bet she was white.

1702
01:18:21,850 --> 01:18:24,220
All men aren't like Phil.

1703
01:18:24,220 --> 01:18:27,300
- No, some are like Dave.
 - Shut up.

1704
01:18:30,720 --> 01:18:31,690
My mouth's getting dry.

1705
01:18:31,690 --> 01:18:32,520
You got any candy?

1706
01:18:32,520 --> 01:18:33,820
There's breath
 freshener in my purse.

1707
01:18:38,730 --> 01:18:39,820
You got anything fresher?

1708
01:18:39,820 --> 01:18:41,820
This stuff tastes
 like old socks.

1709
01:18:41,820 --> 01:18:44,350
- That's not breath freshener.
 - It's not?

1710
01:18:44,350 --> 01:18:46,960
Nah, it was given to me
 by my assertive instructor.

1711
01:18:46,960 --> 01:18:48,160
For what, insect repellent?

1712
01:18:48,160 --> 01:18:49,940
- This stuff is terrible.
 - No, no.

1713
01:18:49,940 --> 01:18:51,270
He said it would help
 you achieve your--

1714
01:18:54,870 --> 01:18:55,830
Your what?

1715
01:18:55,830 --> 01:18:57,990
Wait a minute.

1716
01:18:57,990 --> 01:18:59,130
Did you take this stuff?

1717
01:18:59,130 --> 01:19:00,780
Yes, and it was awful.

1718
01:19:03,770 --> 01:19:05,560
Before you turned white?

1719
01:19:05,560 --> 01:19:08,580
Yeah, the other day at work.

1720
01:19:08,580 --> 01:19:10,710
No, this couldn't be.

1721
01:19:10,710 --> 01:19:11,450
What?

1722
01:19:11,450 --> 01:19:13,800
He said that it
 will help you be

1723
01:19:13,800 --> 01:19:16,650
what you need to be to
 achieve your heart's desires.

1724
01:19:16,650 --> 01:19:19,100
Your what?

1725
01:19:19,100 --> 01:19:22,820
Melanie, your heart's
 desire was to have

1726
01:19:22,820 --> 01:19:24,170
Dave love you more, right?

1727
01:19:24,170 --> 01:19:27,060
You turned white and he did.
 - Come on.

1728
01:19:27,060 --> 01:19:28,220
That doesn't make sense.

1729
01:19:28,220 --> 01:19:30,500
It's the only thing
 that does make sense!

1730
01:19:30,500 --> 01:19:33,260
I mean, you drank this
 wanting Dave to love you more.

1731
01:19:33,260 --> 01:19:35,600
The next day, you turned white!

1732
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:38,660
You can't tell me this
 came out of a bottle.

1733
01:19:38,660 --> 01:19:40,080
There's only one
 way to find out.

1734
01:19:40,080 --> 01:19:41,240
You're through with Dave, right?

1735
01:19:41,240 --> 01:19:41,960
Totally.

1736
01:19:41,960 --> 01:19:43,640
So you just take
 another swig of this

1737
01:19:43,640 --> 01:19:45,380
and you'll change black again.

1738
01:19:45,380 --> 01:19:47,180
I'm not taking any
 more of that crap.

1739
01:19:47,180 --> 01:19:49,100
Melanie, think about it.

1740
01:19:49,100 --> 01:19:52,250
I mean, if this changed you,
 it could change you back.

1741
01:19:52,250 --> 01:19:54,740
I told you, I'm not drinking
 any of that terrible stuff.

1742
01:19:58,600 --> 01:20:01,930
Well, was your heart's desire
 to have Dave love you more

1743
01:20:01,930 --> 01:20:03,850
or to turn white?

1744
01:20:03,850 --> 01:20:05,260
Oh, what do you think?

1745
01:20:05,260 --> 01:20:07,270
Well, I think you
 prefer yourself this way.

1746
01:20:07,270 --> 01:20:09,230
White, black, I'm still me.

1747
01:20:09,230 --> 01:20:11,980
Well, I don't know
 who you are anymore.

1748
01:20:11,980 --> 01:20:13,600
You want to know who I am?

1749
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:15,390
I'm a woman who's been
 trying her whole life

1750
01:20:15,390 --> 01:20:16,960
to be treated equally.

1751
01:20:16,960 --> 01:20:17,850
But you know what, Tess?

1752
01:20:17,850 --> 01:20:18,940
We're not equal.

1753
01:20:18,940 --> 01:20:20,000
We can't be.

1754
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:21,910
We're all part of a
 random card game in which

1755
01:20:21,910 --> 01:20:23,280

 not everyone gets them.

Man, Melanie, you're starting
 to sound like a racist.

1763
01:20:37,720 --> 01:20:40,700
Let me put it into
 perspective for you.

1764
01:20:40,700 --> 01:20:42,160
Someone goes into
 a car lot looking

1765
01:20:42,160 --> 01:20:45,670
for a red car with specific
 options and accessories.

1766
01:20:45,670 --> 01:20:49,570
And they find a car that has
 all the options, but it's blue.

1767
01:20:49,570 --> 01:20:51,700
Now, even though they
 prefer the red car,

1768
01:20:51,700 --> 01:20:53,380
they settle for the
 blue one, because that's

1769
01:20:53,380 --> 01:20:54,910
what's currently available.

1770
01:20:54,910 --> 01:20:56,450
Well, I was like that blue car.

And Dave loved me
 because I had all

1772
01:20:58,180 --> 01:20:59,960
the options and accessories.

1773
01:20:59,960 --> 01:21:02,710
But he really wasn't getting
 the outer package he preferred.

Well, now, I'm a red car.

1775
01:21:05,380 --> 01:21:08,470
This red car needs to get
 her white ass into a garage,

1776

 fucking overhaul!

 a man who treated you

01:29:18,900 --> 01:29:21,450
Next time Tess offers you
 something out of her purse,

1931
01:29:21,450 --> 01:29:23,090
please turn it down.

1932
01:29:23,090 --> 01:29:25,420
[LAUGHS]

[KNOCKING]

1934
01:29:29,170 --> 01:29:32,680
Who could that be at
 this time of the morning?

1935
01:29:32,680 --> 01:29:34,570
Who is it?
 TESS: It's me.

1936
01:29:40,940 --> 01:29:42,080
Tess?

1937
01:29:42,080 --> 01:29:44,550
Look what it took for that
 son of a bitch to desire me.

1938
01:29:47,880 --> 01:29:50,160
Isn't she a hunk?

1939
01:29:50,160 --> 01:29:54,790
