What's up, Mama?
So I knew she'd be angry.

Were you with him?

No, I wasn't with him.

Oh, you weren't there?

188
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:53,400
Then how you
know about it then?

189
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,168
He told me about it

play with you anymore.

You know, they shot
that kid for no reason?

Oh, you need a reason to
get shot nowadays, Jason?

195
00:14:09,482 --> 00:14:10,918

204
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:09,676
Yeah, I saw it.

205
00:15:09,676 --> 00:15:11,644
He better not
try and marry her.

206
00:15:13,213 --> 00:15:14,514
He will.

207
00:15:14,514 --> 00:15:15,515

livin' with him.

I didn't think.
I know I heard four shots.

231
00:16:36,429 --> 00:16:39,132
Now, did you see
anybody shooting?

232
00:16:39,132 --> 00:16:40,767
I mean, anybody actually
firing a weapon.

233

Did I see
the police shoot him?

earlier in the evening?
Yeah.

and not told you?

In the news tonight,
a high-speed chase

1359
01:30:51,947 --> 01:30:54,517
from Newark to Hill Vale,
New Jersey, turned deadly

1360
01:30:54,517 --> 01:30:59,588
after police opened fire
on a stolen van filled
mostly with teenagers.

1361
01:30:59,588 --> 01:31:02,991
The chase began in Newark
after police
officers spotted a van,

1362
01:31:02,991 --> 01:31:06,028
which had been stolen
at gunpoint a day earlier.

1363

at high speed.

did not stop.

until their investigation
is complete,

some 30 shots were
fired at the van.

When it was over,
two people were dead,

and three others had
been hit by gunfire.

1373

One of the dead was
a pregnant teenage girl.

In all, six people
were in the van.
