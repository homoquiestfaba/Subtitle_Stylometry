1
00:00:35,767 --> 00:00:37,678
WGTO-FM New York.

2
00:00:37,803 --> 00:00:41,410
At 10 AM, it's 93 degrees,
and it's only gonna go up.

3
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:42,610
Be warned, New York,

4
00:00:42,741 --> 00:00:45,551
the hottest day of the year
it is gonna be.

5
00:00:45,677 --> 00:00:48,954
So stay cool and think hard
of that ocean breeze,

6
00:00:49,081 --> 00:00:51,083
'cause you're not gonna get
any of that breeze.

7
00:00:51,216 --> 00:00:54,527
What you're gonna get is hot,
humid, and stormy.

8
00:00:54,653 --> 00:00:56,223
Take heed, New Yorkers,

9
00:00:56,355 --> 00:00:58,130
from a man
who knows the condition,

10
00:00:58,257 --> 00:01:00,999
the tempted condition
of man and woman

11
00:01:01,126 --> 00:01:03,003
under the tropical latitudes:

12
00:01:03,128 --> 00:01:06,302
Mr. C.C. Adcock
of Lafayette, Louisiana,

13
00:01:06,431 --> 00:01:08,502
and his newly recorded song.

14
00:01:48,206 --> 00:01:50,379
- Hi.
- Hey.

15
00:01:51,944 --> 00:01:53,753
Sorry, I should've called.

16
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:30,187
Equations, equations, equations.

17
00:02:31,249 --> 00:02:32,592
I thought you did anthropology?

18
00:02:32,718 --> 00:02:34,026
I do,huh?

19
00:02:34,152 --> 00:02:36,928
I haven't seen you in a while, I guess.

20
00:02:37,055 --> 00:02:38,090
21 months.

21
00:02:39,358 --> 00:02:41,736
- My sister's graduation.
- Right.

22
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:46,036
How are your parents?

23
00:02:46,164 --> 00:02:47,507
Freaking out.

24
00:02:48,533 --> 00:02:49,568
It's my SATs.

25
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:57,177
Heard you had
a lot of girlfriends.

26
00:02:57,309 --> 00:02:58,515
Who told you that?

27
00:02:59,845 --> 00:03:00,915
My sister.

28
00:03:03,181 --> 00:03:04,421
Can I tell you something?

29
00:03:06,451 --> 00:03:07,794
Yeah.

30
00:03:09,688 --> 00:03:11,190
I'm still a virgin.

31
00:03:14,393 --> 00:03:15,838
That's...interesting.

32
00:03:15,961 --> 00:03:17,565
No, it's not.

33
00:03:18,864 --> 00:03:19,865
It's not at all.

34
00:03:23,502 --> 00:03:25,004
I want to do it.

35
00:03:26,672 --> 00:03:27,707
With you.

36
00:03:35,947 --> 00:03:37,187
Well...

37
00:03:39,384 --> 00:03:40,920
do you agree?

38
00:03:42,688 --> 00:03:44,463
What do you think?

39
00:03:44,589 --> 00:03:50,164
I think that you should be thinking
about it a lot more.

40
00:03:50,295 --> 00:03:53,572
I have. For years.

41
00:03:53,699 --> 00:03:55,645
For years?

42
00:03:56,501 --> 00:03:58,174
Do you know
what they used to say in Babylon?

43
00:03:58,303 --> 00:04:02,149
That it wasn't done
for a man to reject a woman

44
00:04:02,274 --> 00:04:04,083
who freely gave herself.

45
00:04:05,844 --> 00:04:06,845
In Babylon?

46
00:04:06,978 --> 00:04:09,151
Wasn't honorable.

47
00:04:09,281 --> 00:04:12,728
And it was bad luck.

48
00:04:16,722 --> 00:04:19,601
Okay, then, let's see.

49
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:21,733
Are you...

50
00:04:24,229 --> 00:04:25,970
free on Saturday?

51
00:04:26,098 --> 00:04:27,509
What about today?

52
00:04:27,632 --> 00:04:28,838
<i>Oh, uh, no.</i>

53
00:04:28,967 --> 00:04:30,605
Today's the perfect day.

54
00:04:33,872 --> 00:04:35,044
What?

55
00:04:36,241 --> 00:04:37,720
You think I don't mean it?

56
00:04:39,478 --> 00:04:42,823
You think I couldn't
find somebody else today?

57
00:04:45,884 --> 00:04:47,192
I would.

58
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:16,716
I'm not scared, you know.

59
00:05:19,251 --> 00:05:20,252
Wait a second.

60
00:05:27,292 --> 00:05:28,862
Take one.

61
00:05:28,994 --> 00:05:29,995
Tie it.

62
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:33,134
You're into Kabbalah, Julie?

63
00:05:33,265 --> 00:05:35,336
- I'm not.
- You're not?

64
00:05:35,467 --> 00:05:38,914
No. I just--I thought it'd be nice.

65
00:05:49,614 --> 00:05:50,615
Your turn.

66
00:05:52,851 --> 00:05:55,092
The left. It's the receiving hand.

67
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:04,270
You don't have to keep it,
you know.

68
00:06:05,197 --> 00:06:06,608
But you shouldn't cut it.

69
00:06:29,688 --> 00:06:31,998
Oh, one last thing. Can I ask?

70
00:06:33,558 --> 00:06:35,629
We put on a piece a music,

71
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,865
and we don't kiss until it's over.

72
00:06:37,996 --> 00:06:39,498
And then what?

73
00:06:41,132 --> 00:06:42,440
And then we do it.

74
00:06:51,576 --> 00:06:53,351
All right.

75
00:07:59,044 --> 00:08:00,648
Try again.

76
00:08:51,096 --> 00:08:52,700
I'm not gonna do that.

77
00:08:52,831 --> 00:08:54,538
I don't believe in it.

78
00:08:58,136 --> 00:09:00,207
No, I think it's ridiculous.

79
00:09:06,144 --> 00:09:07,714
That's her official title, psychic?

80
00:09:07,846 --> 00:09:11,487
Does she have a degree in that?

81
00:09:14,285 --> 00:09:19,132
Okay. So you've--yes--

82
00:09:19,257 --> 00:09:21,134
you've gone to this woman yourself?

83
00:09:30,869 --> 00:09:33,782
Cut, with your left hand.

84
00:09:33,905 --> 00:09:35,475
Does it have to be my left?

85
00:09:35,607 --> 00:09:37,780
It's a tradition.

86
00:09:37,909 --> 00:09:41,982
It's a sacred tradition,
for lack of a better word.

87
00:09:42,113 --> 00:09:43,854
Up to you
if you want to fuck with that.

88
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:48,697
Listen, I don't think
that I'm a good candidate for this.

89
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:50,163
I'm sort of skeptical.

90
00:09:51,556 --> 00:09:53,331
When you're involved
with scientific research,

91
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:55,062
whether it's hard sciences

92
00:09:55,193 --> 00:09:56,797
or social sciences or both--

93
00:09:56,928 --> 00:09:58,999
You're free to leave if you want.

94
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:00,200
You have to understand,

95
00:10:00,331 --> 00:10:01,901
we're not here
to deal with personalities.

96
00:10:02,033 --> 00:10:04,809
Ego is the first thing
that goes out the window

97
00:10:04,936 --> 00:10:06,313
as far as I'm concerned.

98
00:10:06,438 --> 00:10:11,046
So, do you want to stay,
or do you want to leave?

99
00:10:13,344 --> 00:10:14,823
Yeah, I'll stay.

100
00:10:14,946 --> 00:10:17,222
Okay. Good.

101
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:20,627
Tell me
when they're not making sense.

102
00:10:23,855 --> 00:10:25,528
You said you
were writing a book.

103
00:10:25,657 --> 00:10:27,796
What's it about?

104
00:10:27,926 --> 00:10:30,634
It's pretty technical
and theoretic.

105
00:10:33,598 --> 00:10:34,872
What kind of theory?

106
00:10:34,999 --> 00:10:37,570
It's a new equation.

107
00:10:37,702 --> 00:10:39,147
It's a systemic equation.

108
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:42,251
Can we do without the cards?

109
00:10:43,808 --> 00:10:46,288
You like to fight, don't you?

110
00:10:46,411 --> 00:10:51,121
And conquer,
whatever that means.

111
00:10:51,249 --> 00:10:56,892
Power, diplomas,
publicity, women.

112
00:10:57,021 --> 00:10:59,695
You like to conquer
with your sword?

113
00:11:00,692 --> 00:11:02,433
You saw that in the cards?

114
00:11:04,162 --> 00:11:08,042
Let me tell you something
about the cards, okay?

115
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:10,339
The cards are here to help you.

116
00:11:10,468 --> 00:11:13,677
They're here to stage
something in your imagination.

117
00:11:15,006 --> 00:11:18,385
What I see,
I see without the cards.

118
00:11:19,043 --> 00:11:20,351
Do you understand?

119
00:11:23,781 --> 00:11:25,818
Do you know
why you came here today?

120
00:11:27,919 --> 00:11:29,762
Curiosity.

121
00:11:29,888 --> 00:11:34,359
Something else, more specific?

122
00:11:35,226 --> 00:11:39,140
Something struck your sword?

123
00:11:39,264 --> 00:11:41,244
Your power?

124
00:11:41,366 --> 00:11:42,811
Is that what happened?

125
00:11:46,137 --> 00:11:48,549
Are you into Kabbalah, Adam?

126
00:11:48,673 --> 00:11:50,778
No, that's just a gift.

127
00:11:52,277 --> 00:11:54,883
And curses?

128
00:11:55,013 --> 00:11:57,152
- Do you believe in curses?
- I don't.

129
00:11:57,282 --> 00:11:59,125
I can't.

130
00:12:00,618 --> 00:12:02,188
Actually, I don't know,
I don't know.

131
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,355
Do you?

132
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:07,365
It depends.

133
00:12:11,229 --> 00:12:13,106
You think you might, um...

134
00:12:13,231 --> 00:12:15,837
know a way
to deal with that problem?

135
00:12:17,702 --> 00:12:18,737
I might,

136
00:12:19,904 --> 00:12:24,046
but it would involve you engaging

137
00:12:24,175 --> 00:12:27,213
with a part of yourself
that you don't really know.

138
00:12:31,883 --> 00:12:33,362
Are you willing to try?

139
00:12:53,871 --> 00:12:57,478
Use this on your entire body.

140
00:13:09,721 --> 00:13:12,600
I think your soul is feeling

141
00:13:12,724 --> 00:13:14,328
trapped right now in your book.

142
00:13:14,459 --> 00:13:17,269
You need to know
what your book really is about.

143
00:13:17,395 --> 00:13:18,396
I do.

144
00:13:18,529 --> 00:13:19,667
Anyway, that doesn't
have anything to do

145
00:13:19,797 --> 00:13:21,174
with my private life.

146
00:13:21,299 --> 00:13:23,609
Oh, God,
maybe I should see a priest.

147
00:13:23,735 --> 00:13:25,681
Calm down. You're Jewish.

148
00:13:25,803 --> 00:13:27,305
It doesn't work that way.

149
00:13:30,541 --> 00:13:32,384
All right, that's enough.

150
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:33,750
Rinse.

151
00:13:44,522 --> 00:13:45,660
Careful with these.

152
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:48,566
Only on your penis,
your testicles,

153
00:13:48,693 --> 00:13:51,299
your scrotum,
and your anus.

154
00:14:02,206 --> 00:14:03,514
Hold it.

155
00:14:08,413 --> 00:14:11,986
If you believe
in the existence of the soul,

156
00:14:12,116 --> 00:14:15,256
it's not so difficult
to believe in previous lives

157
00:14:15,386 --> 00:14:17,764
and in the possibility

158
00:14:17,889 --> 00:14:20,529
that two souls have met before.

159
00:14:21,225 --> 00:14:22,499
Hold it.

160
00:14:22,627 --> 00:14:27,633
Same souls, different bodies,
different incarnations.

161
00:14:28,533 --> 00:14:30,535
And...

162
00:14:33,104 --> 00:14:34,549
rinse.

163
00:14:43,047 --> 00:14:44,082
God.

164
00:14:51,122 --> 00:14:53,363
Everything is connected.

165
00:14:57,895 --> 00:15:00,876
Your sexual predicament
is the connection

166
00:15:00,998 --> 00:15:03,410
that led you to finding me.

167
00:15:05,036 --> 00:15:06,879
Finding me again.

168
00:15:08,873 --> 00:15:12,446
Now...close your eyes.

169
00:15:16,047 --> 00:15:21,258
Now picture me
doing something sexual.

170
00:15:23,755 --> 00:15:29,831
Not something mild,
something really sexual.

171
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:35,639
Good.

172
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,651
Was what you just
thought about

173
00:15:43,775 --> 00:15:46,051
what I think you thought about?

174
00:15:47,812 --> 00:15:50,622
Because
that was really creative.

175
00:16:25,683 --> 00:16:26,889
Good morning.

176
00:18:36,847 --> 00:18:38,520
You're early.

177
00:18:38,649 --> 00:18:39,889
What's wrong with you guys?

178
00:18:40,017 --> 00:18:42,258
Can't you
ever get your timing right?

179
00:18:43,955 --> 00:18:45,798
I'm sorry.

180
00:18:45,923 --> 00:18:49,632
Please, don't even start
getting polite on me, Diego.

181
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,865
I can't take it, not today.

182
00:18:51,996 --> 00:18:54,067
Maybe you've
changed your mind.

183
00:18:55,066 --> 00:18:56,409
It's okay.
It's okay to change your mind.

184
00:18:56,534 --> 00:18:57,808
I'm fine with that.

185
00:18:57,935 --> 00:19:00,745
What, you want
to run away on me?

186
00:19:00,871 --> 00:19:02,043
Already?

187
00:19:02,173 --> 00:19:03,311
All right, okay.

188
00:19:03,441 --> 00:19:05,148
We don't have to do this.

189
00:19:06,677 --> 00:19:09,453
You know, I don't think
it would ever work anyway,

190
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:11,753
not with the BC rules.

191
00:19:13,317 --> 00:19:14,318
What's that?

192
00:19:14,452 --> 00:19:17,626
Don't tell me you haven't
heard of booty call, Diego.

193
00:19:17,755 --> 00:19:19,792
That's what this is, isn't it?

194
00:19:19,924 --> 00:19:21,801
No strings attached,

195
00:19:21,926 --> 00:19:24,497
no dating, no relationship?

196
00:19:25,329 --> 00:19:26,706
Fuck buddies, okay?

197
00:19:28,532 --> 00:19:29,533
Yes.

198
00:19:29,667 --> 00:19:31,010
Yes to what it means,

199
00:19:31,135 --> 00:19:32,478
or yes to the rules?

200
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,074
Both.

201
00:19:38,376 --> 00:19:42,051
I don't think you could even
stick to the rules, Diego.

202
00:19:43,648 --> 00:19:47,323
"Rule number one:
no meeting in public."

203
00:19:48,953 --> 00:19:52,196
"Rule number two
no forward plans."

204
00:19:52,323 --> 00:19:53,461
Right.

205
00:19:53,591 --> 00:19:54,661
"Rule number three:

206
00:19:54,792 --> 00:19:58,069
"no cuddling
and no pillow talk.

207
00:19:58,195 --> 00:20:00,903
"Number four:
no sleeping over.

208
00:20:01,032 --> 00:20:02,477
Get out before sunrise."

209
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,601
That's right.

210
00:20:03,734 --> 00:20:06,476
"Rule number five:
not more than once a month."

211
00:20:06,604 --> 00:20:07,844
Well, that one sucks.

212
00:20:07,972 --> 00:20:10,452
- Yeah.
- All right, fuck the rules.

213
00:20:10,574 --> 00:20:12,144
They were probably
made by men anyway.

214
00:20:12,276 --> 00:20:15,985
Most rules are made by men.

215
00:20:16,113 --> 00:20:17,888
You know what?

216
00:20:18,015 --> 00:20:22,828
You're the only woman I know
who gets even more beautiful

217
00:20:22,953 --> 00:20:24,557
when she gets more angry.

218
00:20:28,693 --> 00:20:29,797
What you just said, Diego,

219
00:20:29,927 --> 00:20:31,531
do you really mean that?

220
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:34,268
Yeah.

221
00:20:36,867 --> 00:20:37,971
Well, what do--

222
00:20:38,102 --> 00:20:39,809
What do you want to do now?

223
00:20:42,273 --> 00:20:46,278
Don't even pretend
with me, Diego.

224
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:49,016
You know exactly
what we're gonna do.

225
00:21:01,358 --> 00:21:03,304
There's something
I'd like to tell you.

226
00:21:04,328 --> 00:21:05,534
Yeah?

227
00:21:09,333 --> 00:21:10,676
I think...

228
00:21:13,704 --> 00:21:14,808
I'm in love.

229
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:18,377
- You are?
- Yeah.

230
00:21:20,177 --> 00:21:22,350
I mean, not with you.

231
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,255
Don't worry,
I know what you said.

232
00:21:24,381 --> 00:21:25,416
Only booty, right?

233
00:21:25,549 --> 00:21:26,755
Yeah.

234
00:21:26,884 --> 00:21:27,988
And today,
it was really good booty.

235
00:21:28,119 --> 00:21:29,120
Yeah.

236
00:21:30,488 --> 00:21:32,627
Yeah.
Well, I don't know what to do,

237
00:21:32,757 --> 00:21:36,671
'cause I've never talked to her.

238
00:21:36,794 --> 00:21:39,070
You haven't talked to her.

239
00:21:40,231 --> 00:21:43,610
What makes you think
it's really love?

240
00:21:43,734 --> 00:21:45,236
I don't know.

241
00:21:46,871 --> 00:21:49,147
I think about her a lot.

242
00:21:54,445 --> 00:21:56,584
I wrote her a poem.
Can I read it to you?

243
00:21:57,648 --> 00:21:59,093
Sure.

244
00:22:05,156 --> 00:22:08,626
"Three times you raised
your eyes, my love."

245
00:22:09,994 --> 00:22:14,272
"And what was free
and loose and lost in me

246
00:22:14,398 --> 00:22:15,604
became your prisoner."

247
00:22:17,201 --> 00:22:20,148
"I'll never need
to know your name, my love,

248
00:22:20,271 --> 00:22:22,751
"or to know your story.

249
00:22:22,873 --> 00:22:27,447
"Your name
is Joy, Grace, and Beauty,

250
00:22:27,578 --> 00:22:31,424
"since that day,
that sacred moment

251
00:22:31,549 --> 00:22:35,861
when three times you raised
your eyes, my love."

252
00:22:37,588 --> 00:22:39,192
You think I should give it to her?

253
00:22:40,691 --> 00:22:42,364
Well...

254
00:22:44,428 --> 00:22:48,137
What makes you think
she feels the same about you?

255
00:22:48,265 --> 00:22:51,075
It takes two to tango,
you know?

256
00:22:51,202 --> 00:22:54,547
Well, she did
look at me three times.

257
00:22:54,672 --> 00:22:56,242
That's it.

258
00:22:56,373 --> 00:22:57,977
And where was that?

259
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:02,047
At the center
where I do capoeira.

260
00:23:03,113 --> 00:23:04,558
She does yoga.

261
00:23:08,686 --> 00:23:10,029
I don't--

262
00:23:10,154 --> 00:23:13,033
Why do you think
she won't talk to me?

263
00:23:14,225 --> 00:23:16,102
Maybe she's mute.

264
00:23:17,428 --> 00:23:18,498
No.

265
00:23:28,873 --> 00:23:31,251
Next time you see her,

266
00:23:31,375 --> 00:23:33,878
bring her three blue roses

267
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:36,391
and a small lemon.

268
00:23:37,514 --> 00:23:38,959
She'll talk to you.

269
00:23:41,452 --> 00:23:43,830
Blue roses, not red?

270
00:23:45,055 --> 00:23:47,433
And a small lemon? Why?

271
00:23:47,558 --> 00:23:50,038
She'll talk to you,

272
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,901
and she'll be your lover.

273
00:25:14,178 --> 00:25:17,387
Bring her three blue roses
and a small lemon.

274
00:25:17,514 --> 00:25:20,791
She'll talk to you,
and she'll be your lover.

275
00:26:27,051 --> 00:26:29,657
Is that for me,
or is that for you?

276
00:26:39,363 --> 00:26:41,468
Why are you following me?

277
00:26:41,598 --> 00:26:45,808
It's a very serious crime...

278
00:26:47,304 --> 00:26:48,578
stalking.

279
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:52,544
No, wait, I didn't do stalking.

280
00:26:53,844 --> 00:26:57,018
What exactly is it that you want?

281
00:26:57,748 --> 00:27:01,321
Is it...me?

282
00:27:02,252 --> 00:27:03,526
Yes.

283
00:27:03,654 --> 00:27:05,634
I mean, not in a bad way.

284
00:27:11,028 --> 00:27:12,473
Excuse me.

285
00:27:27,811 --> 00:27:29,586
So what's your name?

286
00:27:30,681 --> 00:27:31,785
Diego.

287
00:27:32,916 --> 00:27:34,691
It used be Fidel back in Cuba.

288
00:27:34,818 --> 00:27:36,354
- You can sit down.
- Thank you.

289
00:27:39,356 --> 00:27:40,835
It was better to change it.

290
00:27:42,759 --> 00:27:45,171
Listen, Fidel,

291
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:47,834
I'm not normal.

292
00:27:49,166 --> 00:27:52,079
I can't make love normally.

293
00:27:55,706 --> 00:27:57,447
Nobody does.

294
00:27:58,876 --> 00:28:01,152
Yeah, but I can't have pleasure.

295
00:28:01,278 --> 00:28:03,189
Not anymore.

296
00:28:04,181 --> 00:28:06,661
I had surgery.

297
00:28:08,619 --> 00:28:10,189
Heart surgery...

298
00:28:12,523 --> 00:28:14,093
three times.

299
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:19,704
They turned me
into some kind of a freak.

300
00:28:21,798 --> 00:28:22,902
You don't look like one.

301
00:28:23,033 --> 00:28:24,671
I don't know what I look like.

302
00:28:26,670 --> 00:28:29,173
I look like a big scar.

303
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:32,377
You know what I think?

304
00:28:32,509 --> 00:28:34,045
I think scars are okay.

305
00:28:35,812 --> 00:28:37,485
I think scars are good.

306
00:28:38,982 --> 00:28:41,690
They show
you did something special.

307
00:28:42,686 --> 00:28:44,427
I didn't.

308
00:28:46,089 --> 00:28:48,160
The doctors did.

309
00:28:49,459 --> 00:28:52,338
If you let me love you,

310
00:28:52,462 --> 00:28:53,964
I'm pretty sure I can help.

311
00:28:54,965 --> 00:28:56,603
There are many ways.

312
00:28:56,733 --> 00:28:59,077
There's capoiera.
I do capoiera.

313
00:29:09,413 --> 00:29:11,256
I don't know why,

314
00:29:11,381 --> 00:29:16,763
but I feel like I could
be naked in front of you.

315
00:30:14,311 --> 00:30:15,790
Okay.

316
00:32:09,793 --> 00:32:10,965
How are you feeling this week,
Laura?

317
00:32:14,231 --> 00:32:16,973
I was okay until today,

318
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:20,775
but, um, then...

319
00:32:25,642 --> 00:32:26,746
Why don't
you come around here?

320
00:32:26,877 --> 00:32:28,254
I'll take a look at you.

321
00:32:34,117 --> 00:32:36,154
Just stand right here for me.

322
00:32:50,434 --> 00:32:52,209
You need a dynamic.

323
00:32:52,335 --> 00:32:53,780
What?

324
00:32:55,605 --> 00:32:57,380
Does it hurt?

325
00:32:57,507 --> 00:32:59,384
Only if you're tense.

326
00:33:01,044 --> 00:33:03,354
All right, let's give it a go.

327
00:33:04,815 --> 00:33:06,795
Put you head forward
look at your toes.

328
00:33:07,651 --> 00:33:09,392
Relax, relax.

329
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:10,520
Okay, just relax.

330
00:33:11,655 --> 00:33:12,656
Yeah?

331
00:33:50,627 --> 00:33:52,698
I'll stop, I'll stop.

332
00:33:54,164 --> 00:33:56,667
Don't stop. I'll keep it down.

333
00:34:12,449 --> 00:34:14,087
Next one not here yet?

334
00:34:26,997 --> 00:34:28,738
Don't look at me like that.

335
00:34:29,566 --> 00:34:31,512
We can't do this.

336
00:34:31,635 --> 00:34:34,172
You being naked like this
means that I'm...

337
00:34:35,505 --> 00:34:37,576
I'm molesting you, so...

338
00:34:46,182 --> 00:34:49,095
How much do you know
about what is called transference?

339
00:34:50,453 --> 00:34:51,557
What you think you feel for me

340
00:34:51,688 --> 00:34:52,894
is not really what you feel.

341
00:34:53,023 --> 00:34:56,095
What you feel are
projected redirected feelings

342
00:34:56,226 --> 00:34:57,830
that you shouldn't
feel like feelings,

343
00:34:57,961 --> 00:35:00,441
not real feelings.

344
00:35:01,598 --> 00:35:02,872
They're feelings from your past

345
00:35:02,999 --> 00:35:05,479
that you are transferencering--

346
00:35:05,602 --> 00:35:10,210
transferen--transferencing...to me,

347
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:12,445
on me, onto me,

348
00:35:12,576 --> 00:35:14,613
but not onto the real me,

349
00:35:14,744 --> 00:35:18,214
onto some idea
that you have of me.

350
00:35:19,082 --> 00:35:21,926
An interesting contradiction.

351
00:35:22,052 --> 00:35:26,501
It's all about
the fluidity of sexual energy and...

352
00:35:28,525 --> 00:35:29,936
and self-control.

353
00:35:33,330 --> 00:35:35,367
Are you done?

354
00:35:36,499 --> 00:35:37,500
I'm done.

355
00:35:45,575 --> 00:35:50,456
"I, Laura Lee,

356
00:35:51,581 --> 00:35:58,089
"fully aware of the concept of

357
00:35:58,221 --> 00:36:01,634
trans...ference..."

358
00:36:04,628 --> 00:36:09,509
"consent to engage..."

359
00:36:11,301 --> 00:36:19,413
"in a sexual relationship

360
00:36:19,542 --> 00:36:22,955
"with Dr. Matt Roberts

361
00:36:23,079 --> 00:36:27,459
on June 1, 2009."

362
00:36:29,019 --> 00:36:31,397
All right, you can't
control me with a piece of paper.

363
00:36:32,355 --> 00:36:37,270
Damn, you are manipulative
in a really weird way.

364
00:36:37,927 --> 00:36:41,431
You can
really be quite perverse.

365
00:36:42,465 --> 00:36:44,843
Maybe I am.

366
00:36:44,968 --> 00:36:46,948
But at least I'm in touch

367
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:50,210
with my instincts
and my impulses.

368
00:36:50,907 --> 00:36:52,716
And that's what they tell me--

369
00:36:52,842 --> 00:36:55,516
that we do it right here.

370
00:36:55,645 --> 00:36:57,056
But your instincts, your imp--

371
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:58,181
Right now!

372
00:36:58,314 --> 00:37:00,658
Your impulses, they, um...

373
00:37:02,118 --> 00:37:03,756
They play tricks on you.

374
00:37:14,097 --> 00:37:15,701
Hey, Kim, it's Matt.

375
00:37:16,666 --> 00:37:19,272
I'm really excited about going
to the Hamptons this weekend.

376
00:37:20,170 --> 00:37:21,740
If you're free,
why don't we head down tonight?

377
00:37:21,871 --> 00:37:25,318
I'm coming down to your part
of town right now.

378
00:37:25,442 --> 00:37:26,819
All right, I'll see you soon.

379
00:37:26,943 --> 00:37:29,219
Hey, Kim, it's Matt.

380
00:37:30,447 --> 00:37:32,222
I'm looking forward
to the Hamptons this weekend.

381
00:37:32,348 --> 00:37:35,124
Let me try to meet
you later for drinks.

382
00:37:35,251 --> 00:37:37,288
Give me a call, tell me
where you're at, and, um...

383
00:37:58,775 --> 00:38:00,982
Hey, Kim, it's Matt.

384
00:38:01,111 --> 00:38:03,455
I'd love to meet for a drink later.

385
00:38:39,783 --> 00:38:41,592
Morning, Kim.

386
00:38:41,718 --> 00:38:42,719
It's Matt.

387
00:38:42,852 --> 00:38:44,763
Hello.

388
00:38:45,688 --> 00:38:46,758
Are we still on?

389
00:38:46,890 --> 00:38:49,097
What are we on for?
What was it again?

390
00:38:50,326 --> 00:38:51,964
Uh, Hamptons, Montauk.

391
00:38:52,829 --> 00:38:55,105
I got the car.
I'm around the corner.

392
00:38:55,231 --> 00:38:56,676
Come up, fourth floor.

393
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:57,801
All right.

394
00:39:13,082 --> 00:39:14,561
Hi, guys.

395
00:39:48,418 --> 00:39:49,658
Hi.

396
00:39:49,786 --> 00:39:51,094
Hey.

397
00:40:28,258 --> 00:40:30,829
You really want
to drive all that way?

398
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:31,995
Yeah.

399
00:40:33,196 --> 00:40:34,766
It'll clear up.

400
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:37,844
Yeah.

401
00:40:45,074 --> 00:40:46,951
Pretty wild stuff.

402
00:40:50,246 --> 00:40:52,192
It was fun last night.
You should've come.

403
00:40:52,315 --> 00:40:53,521
Yeah, well...

404
00:40:53,650 --> 00:40:55,891
You missed something.

405
00:40:57,186 --> 00:40:58,688
Is that you there?

406
00:41:03,293 --> 00:41:04,431
So...

407
00:41:05,762 --> 00:41:06,763
you're 93)'-

408
00:41:10,033 --> 00:41:11,603
I don't think so.

409
00:41:12,802 --> 00:41:14,213
I slept with you.

410
00:41:14,337 --> 00:41:17,011
Did you sleep with her?

411
00:41:19,108 --> 00:41:20,951
Sleep like sleep, or sleep like sex?

412
00:41:21,077 --> 00:41:22,420
Come on.

413
00:41:27,350 --> 00:41:28,385
She's a model.

414
00:41:28,518 --> 00:41:29,997
She didn't have a place to stay.

415
00:41:30,119 --> 00:41:32,292
What does that mean?

416
00:41:33,423 --> 00:41:35,630
It doesn't count
if it's with a model?

417
00:41:37,827 --> 00:41:39,568
It doesn't mean anything.

418
00:41:41,864 --> 00:41:43,775
She's from Somalia,
and she speaks French,

419
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:45,811
pretty good French.

420
00:41:45,935 --> 00:41:48,711
It means you're bisexual.

421
00:41:50,506 --> 00:41:51,644
I'm not bisexual.

422
00:41:55,111 --> 00:41:56,715
I just slept with that girl.

423
00:42:10,793 --> 00:42:12,830
Come on.

424
00:42:12,962 --> 00:42:14,441
Pack your bags.

425
00:42:32,615 --> 00:42:34,356
So those other guys here, uh...

426
00:42:35,685 --> 00:42:37,687
one of them was
your ex-boyfriend, wasn't he?

427
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:41,529
Yeah, Fabrizio. He's cool.

428
00:42:43,993 --> 00:42:46,769
Do you still sleep with him?

429
00:42:49,365 --> 00:42:50,867
He's got his own bed.

430
00:42:52,502 --> 00:42:53,981
Anyway, he's too rough.

431
00:42:55,438 --> 00:42:56,439
Hey, listen,

432
00:42:56,572 --> 00:42:58,347
I'm not that easy, you know.

433
00:43:14,090 --> 00:43:16,400
Okay, you've got yourself a girlfriend
for the weekend.

434
00:43:16,526 --> 00:43:17,630
Wait.

435
00:43:19,462 --> 00:43:20,736
What?

436
00:43:40,950 --> 00:43:42,588
Fuck the Hamptons.

437
00:43:42,718 --> 00:43:44,959
Okay.

438
00:43:45,088 --> 00:43:46,931
Fuck the Hamptons.

439
00:44:00,403 --> 00:44:02,940
So what exactly happened
last night?

440
00:44:03,873 --> 00:44:05,045
Was that the first time?

441
00:44:09,412 --> 00:44:10,857
- What first time?
- With that girl.

442
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:12,721
Was it the first time
you slept with her?

443
00:44:14,383 --> 00:44:16,761
What about with other girls?

444
00:44:18,421 --> 00:44:19,456
What do you think?

445
00:44:19,589 --> 00:44:20,863
Why are you asking?

446
00:44:20,990 --> 00:44:22,264
I'm just curious.

447
00:44:22,391 --> 00:44:23,665
Really, curious?

448
00:44:23,793 --> 00:44:25,864
Are you curious,
or you're jealous?

449
00:44:25,995 --> 00:44:27,406
I'm curious.

450
00:44:29,198 --> 00:44:31,405
So what?
How did it start?

451
00:44:35,171 --> 00:44:37,014
Who made
the first move physically?

452
00:44:37,140 --> 00:44:39,211
Was it you or...?

453
00:44:39,342 --> 00:44:41,322
What was the first move?

454
00:44:42,378 --> 00:44:44,585
Hey, please,

455
00:44:44,714 --> 00:44:47,388
don't start getting
jealous and possessive on me.

456
00:44:47,517 --> 00:44:48,518
It's not about being jealous.

457
00:44:48,651 --> 00:44:51,359
It's about our true instincts.

458
00:44:51,487 --> 00:44:53,489
There's nothing wrong
with having, uh,

459
00:44:53,623 --> 00:44:56,399
boundaries and certain territories.

460
00:44:56,526 --> 00:44:57,470
Oh, yeah.

461
00:44:57,593 --> 00:44:59,368
They're also a part of our instincts.

462
00:45:04,267 --> 00:45:05,610
Well, actually,
when you're acting,

463
00:45:05,735 --> 00:45:07,043
of course, it's different.

464
00:45:07,170 --> 00:45:09,377
It can even be interesting

465
00:45:09,505 --> 00:45:10,848
how far you go,

466
00:45:10,973 --> 00:45:13,112
how far you're allowed to go.

467
00:45:13,242 --> 00:45:14,277
Yeah.

468
00:45:14,410 --> 00:45:16,048
How far would you want to go

469
00:45:16,179 --> 00:45:17,658
for a love scene?

470
00:45:17,780 --> 00:45:18,815
Have you done any?

471
00:45:18,948 --> 00:45:21,326
Nothing really bold, no.

472
00:45:21,450 --> 00:45:23,327
Well, how far would you go'?

473
00:45:26,222 --> 00:45:27,326
I don't know.

474
00:45:27,456 --> 00:45:29,663
Would you go all the way
if they asked you to?

475
00:45:31,961 --> 00:45:34,100
What kind of all the way?

476
00:45:34,230 --> 00:45:35,800
Taking all my clothes off?

477
00:45:38,301 --> 00:45:39,405
Would you?

478
00:45:44,407 --> 00:45:45,511
It depends.

479
00:45:47,643 --> 00:45:49,486
Would you go all the way
with another guy?

480
00:45:50,780 --> 00:45:52,282
What if I did?

481
00:45:57,386 --> 00:46:01,528
Of course I wouldn't
do it...darling.

482
00:46:01,657 --> 00:46:04,638
Not unless they gave me
$10 million.

483
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:06,398
And then?

484
00:46:06,529 --> 00:46:08,167
And then I'd be rich.

485
00:46:20,876 --> 00:46:23,186
O, beware, my lord, of jealousy.

486
00:46:24,413 --> 00:46:27,553
It is the green-ey'd monster,
which doth mock...

487
00:46:28,651 --> 00:46:30,460
the meat it feeds on.

488
00:47:00,416 --> 00:47:01,690
The Waverly, good morning.

489
00:47:01,817 --> 00:47:02,818
Hi, Kim.

490
00:47:02,952 --> 00:47:05,193
It is you, Kim, isn't it?

491
00:47:05,321 --> 00:47:07,699
What can we do for you, sir?

492
00:47:07,823 --> 00:47:08,824
Ah, good.

493
00:47:08,958 --> 00:47:11,268
I only ask because, um,

494
00:47:11,394 --> 00:47:14,341
it was someone else
last night and this morning.

495
00:47:14,463 --> 00:47:18,912
Do you need
a wake-up call, Mr. Barron?

496
00:47:19,035 --> 00:47:20,514
Yes, please, 6:30.

497
00:47:22,171 --> 00:47:23,275
Very well, sir. Good night.

498
00:47:23,406 --> 00:47:24,749
Wait, listen.

499
00:47:28,144 --> 00:47:30,351
Tomorrow is my last day here.

500
00:47:30,479 --> 00:47:31,981
I need to see you.

501
00:47:33,716 --> 00:47:35,718
I don't think so, Mr. Barron.

502
00:47:35,851 --> 00:47:37,660
I tell you what,

503
00:47:38,821 --> 00:47:40,823
give me sixty seconds, okay?

504
00:47:40,956 --> 00:47:42,629
Just one minute.

505
00:47:43,659 --> 00:47:46,265
Your one minute turned
into 100 the other night.

506
00:47:46,395 --> 00:47:47,931
Yes, well,
we were doing your lines.

507
00:47:48,064 --> 00:47:50,510
Shakespeare counts triple.

508
00:47:50,633 --> 00:47:51,771
I, uh...

509
00:47:53,903 --> 00:47:56,315
bought a copy of the play

510
00:47:57,039 --> 00:47:58,609
if you want to do it again.

511
00:48:00,209 --> 00:48:02,189
Are you still there?

512
00:48:02,311 --> 00:48:03,483
Yeah.

513
00:48:03,612 --> 00:48:06,092
Ah, good,
now imagine if you will

514
00:48:06,215 --> 00:48:10,288
your faithful insomniac
in his lonely pajamas,

515
00:48:10,419 --> 00:48:13,957
slipping into the lean, mean,
infamous skin of Macbeth.

516
00:48:15,791 --> 00:48:19,398
What, uh...
What's the scene number?

517
00:48:19,528 --> 00:48:20,700
I'm not doing "Macbeth" anymore.

518
00:48:20,830 --> 00:48:22,104
I'm doing "Othello."

519
00:48:22,231 --> 00:48:23,710
I can do "Othello."

520
00:48:23,833 --> 00:48:26,245
Well, thanks, Mr. Barron,
but you know,

521
00:48:26,369 --> 00:48:28,144
I've got the switchboard
down here.

522
00:48:29,905 --> 00:48:31,714
Oh, yes, the switchboard.

523
00:48:32,608 --> 00:48:34,417
There is
something poetic about that.

524
00:48:35,811 --> 00:48:38,314
Poetic? What's your definition?

525
00:48:38,447 --> 00:48:39,585
Something with possibilities.

526
00:48:40,916 --> 00:48:43,294
Anything with possibilities.

527
00:48:45,454 --> 00:48:47,024
Anything? Wow.

528
00:48:47,156 --> 00:48:49,568
Probabilities
are not so interesting,

529
00:48:49,692 --> 00:48:52,502
and certainties
are not at all, but...

530
00:48:53,763 --> 00:48:56,107
Well, it's like your call
in the morning,

531
00:48:56,232 --> 00:48:59,611
the tone, the timbre,
the rhythm of your voice.

532
00:49:00,369 --> 00:49:01,712
It has possibilities.

533
00:49:02,638 --> 00:49:04,948
I'll set the automated call,
Mr. Barron.

534
00:49:05,074 --> 00:49:06,576
You need a little bit of sleep.

535
00:49:07,410 --> 00:49:09,253
Oh, no,
I won't be able to sleep.

536
00:49:09,378 --> 00:49:11,858
I'll keep thinking that we
should've read Shakespeare.

537
00:49:13,015 --> 00:49:16,462
Come, you spirits that tend
on mortal thoughts,

538
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:19,831
unsex me here,

539
00:49:19,955 --> 00:49:22,799
and fill me from the crown
to the toe topful

540
00:49:22,925 --> 00:49:24,598
of direst cruelty.

541
00:49:25,428 --> 00:49:27,101
Hold on one second.

542
00:49:35,838 --> 00:49:37,647
Where were we at?

543
00:49:39,175 --> 00:49:41,018
You don't to have to say yes,
just say maybe.

544
00:49:41,143 --> 00:49:42,622
A possibility.

545
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:45,418
I don't do blind dates.

546
00:49:45,548 --> 00:49:47,289
It wouldn't be a blind date.
You know plenty about me.

547
00:49:47,416 --> 00:49:49,521
Including
how many girlfriends you have.

548
00:49:49,652 --> 00:49:50,892
Don't forget, Mr. Barron,

549
00:49:51,020 --> 00:49:52,795
this is a switchboard down here.

550
00:49:52,922 --> 00:49:54,060
You should be
more careful, actually,

551
00:49:54,190 --> 00:49:55,669
if you want to be senator one day.

552
00:49:55,791 --> 00:49:57,270
Oh, no, I'll never be a senator.

553
00:49:57,393 --> 00:49:58,463
I don't look the part.

554
00:49:58,594 --> 00:49:59,937
Besides,
you have to be a perfect citizen

555
00:50:00,062 --> 00:50:01,132
in order to be a senator,

556
00:50:01,263 --> 00:50:02,298
or at least pretend
like you're one,

557
00:50:02,431 --> 00:50:03,808
which is even worse.

558
00:50:05,568 --> 00:50:07,309
So what do you think?
Will I see you tomorrow?

559
00:50:10,206 --> 00:50:11,241
No.

560
00:50:13,442 --> 00:50:15,513
I'll be at the Belcourt at 5:00.

561
00:50:15,644 --> 00:50:17,521
I'll be wearing, uh...

562
00:50:19,515 --> 00:50:20,755
I'll be wearing a hat.

563
00:50:20,883 --> 00:50:21,884
And?

564
00:50:22,017 --> 00:50:26,159
And maybe you'll come.

565
00:51:36,458 --> 00:51:37,766
Kim?

566
00:51:39,295 --> 00:51:40,797
Thank you.

567
00:53:05,114 --> 00:53:06,718
I'm actually
very interested to know

568
00:53:06,849 --> 00:53:08,988
about this all-female version
of "Othello"?

569
00:53:15,157 --> 00:53:16,864
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to interrupt.

570
00:53:16,992 --> 00:53:18,062
I'm Claire.

571
00:53:18,193 --> 00:53:20,195
Julian.
It's nice to meet you, Claire.

572
00:53:28,237 --> 00:53:30,183
Nice, nice.

573
00:53:30,305 --> 00:53:34,378
Well, uh, have a nice drink.

574
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:40,253
I need to get going.

575
00:54:14,616 --> 00:54:16,061
Maybe you shouldn't
have left your chaperon.

576
00:54:16,185 --> 00:54:17,823
And maybe you would agree

577
00:54:17,953 --> 00:54:20,126
to take your entrance scene
again from the top...

578
00:54:22,758 --> 00:54:23,964
Claire?

579
00:54:28,030 --> 00:54:29,338
Maybe.

580
00:55:14,209 --> 00:55:16,348
How did you find out?

581
00:55:19,815 --> 00:55:21,453
I recognized your voice.

582
00:55:28,123 --> 00:55:30,330
Are you telling me the truth?

583
00:55:32,628 --> 00:55:33,902
Why would I lie?

584
00:55:37,666 --> 00:55:40,408
People lie all the time.

585
00:55:42,137 --> 00:55:44,344
Especially about those things.

586
00:55:46,175 --> 00:55:48,485
I'd lie to you
if I had good reason to.

587
00:55:55,050 --> 00:55:56,620
Maybe you do.

588
00:56:16,305 --> 00:56:18,410
I'm sorry, Mr. Chairman.

589
00:56:18,540 --> 00:56:20,747
I just finished
the Phoenix speech.

590
00:56:20,876 --> 00:56:23,652
I'm gonna need 36 hours
for the Boston one.

591
00:56:23,779 --> 00:56:25,053
We just pulled up.

592
00:56:25,180 --> 00:56:26,352
Are you sure
that your guy can find us

593
00:56:26,481 --> 00:56:28,085
in the middle
of this fucking mess?

594
00:56:31,620 --> 00:56:32,997
I guess he has.

595
00:56:55,377 --> 00:56:56,412
I'm gonna walk.

596
00:57:06,355 --> 00:57:08,596
I'm sorry, Mr. Chairman,
I'm gonna lose reception now.

597
00:57:08,724 --> 00:57:10,499
I'll be back
in Washington tomorrow.

598
00:58:24,833 --> 00:58:27,643
So you got more
of your conceptual shit.

599
00:58:27,769 --> 00:58:29,806
It's so painfully trendy, Alice.

600
00:58:29,938 --> 00:58:32,214
You should come to the sales.

601
00:58:32,341 --> 00:58:34,480
I've got seats for Christie's,
you know.

602
00:58:36,078 --> 00:58:37,614
You shouldn't grace
their dry little benches

603
00:58:37,746 --> 00:58:39,885
with the moistness
of your magnificent pussy.

604
00:58:42,284 --> 00:58:44,059
No dinner then?

605
00:58:44,186 --> 00:58:46,063
Oh, this restaurant thing.

606
00:58:46,188 --> 00:58:48,168
It's a fetish for snobs.

607
00:58:48,957 --> 00:58:50,402
I don't get it.

608
00:58:52,728 --> 00:58:55,265
Of course, you don't get it.

609
00:58:55,397 --> 00:58:58,276
You're my only client
who doesn't act like a real man.

610
00:58:59,768 --> 00:59:01,839
You don't have what it takes.

611
00:59:06,208 --> 00:59:07,448
I do.

612
00:59:07,576 --> 00:59:08,953
I'll show you.

613
00:59:17,352 --> 00:59:18,387
Stop doing that.

614
00:59:18,520 --> 00:59:20,022
Have we started?

615
00:59:20,155 --> 00:59:21,600
We have.

616
00:59:22,891 --> 00:59:24,461
You know we have.

617
00:59:33,402 --> 00:59:35,177
This doesn't stay in the system?

618
00:59:35,303 --> 00:59:37,180
Of course, it does.

619
00:59:40,542 --> 00:59:43,318
I thought you were
giving me a discount.

620
00:59:43,445 --> 00:59:45,049
Why should I?

621
00:59:45,180 --> 00:59:46,921
I'm not a shoe shop.

622
00:59:48,483 --> 00:59:50,463
You can still change your mind.

623
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:54,330
Take me to Starbucks,
and we'll call it quits.

624
00:59:57,626 --> 01:00:00,300
You are allowed to flip-flop.

625
01:00:00,429 --> 01:00:02,409
Liberals do it all the time.

626
01:00:02,531 --> 01:00:03,805
I am not a liberal.

627
01:00:16,078 --> 01:00:18,422
Don't even
think about that room.

628
01:00:21,183 --> 01:00:22,821
Do it.

629
01:01:40,662 --> 01:01:42,198
It doesn't stop you
from sleeping?

630
01:01:43,632 --> 01:01:44,975
It's supposed to.

631
01:01:48,136 --> 01:01:49,137
Julian?

632
01:01:49,271 --> 01:01:50,511
What?

633
01:01:52,908 --> 01:01:55,787
This was our last time.
I'm retiring.

634
01:01:57,279 --> 01:01:58,519
What are you talking about?

635
01:02:01,650 --> 01:02:03,493
You're too successful to retire.

636
01:02:03,618 --> 01:02:05,120
You're the best.

637
01:02:06,922 --> 01:02:08,629
Are you getting married?

638
01:02:08,757 --> 01:02:10,532
No.

639
01:02:11,193 --> 01:02:13,036
I'm opening a gallery.

640
01:02:13,161 --> 01:02:14,799
Oh, Alice,

641
01:02:14,930 --> 01:02:16,671
you're gonna make far less money.

642
01:02:17,632 --> 01:02:19,077
You could actually lose money.

643
01:02:19,201 --> 01:02:21,181
The art market
is incredibly unreliable.

644
01:02:21,303 --> 01:02:22,475
No, this is ridiculous.

645
01:02:22,604 --> 01:02:23,605
Why are you doing this to me?

646
01:02:24,372 --> 01:02:25,646
To you?

647
01:02:27,209 --> 01:02:28,916
You can't do this.

648
01:02:29,044 --> 01:02:31,251
People count on you.
I count on you.

649
01:02:35,984 --> 01:02:38,897
Oh, shit,
you're not taking this seriously.

650
01:02:40,455 --> 01:02:42,560
I have signed the lease.

651
01:02:44,559 --> 01:02:46,129
What about doing both?

652
01:02:46,261 --> 01:02:47,968
I would have a PR problem.

653
01:02:48,096 --> 01:02:49,666
You're gonna have a PR problem.

654
01:02:49,798 --> 01:02:51,141
You can't keep this a secret.

655
01:02:51,266 --> 01:02:53,405
I am not going to.

656
01:02:56,037 --> 01:02:57,607
I'm gonna use this...

657
01:02:59,341 --> 01:03:02,220
as PR, as my past.

658
01:03:04,045 --> 01:03:06,389
I was thinking
about writing a book.

659
01:03:13,555 --> 01:03:15,501
Maybe we can do it together.

660
01:03:18,693 --> 01:03:21,003
Oh, fuck.

661
01:03:29,037 --> 01:03:30,846
There is something else.

662
01:03:42,417 --> 01:03:44,328
I want to have a child.

663
01:03:45,086 --> 01:03:46,087
No.

664
01:03:46,221 --> 01:03:47,325
I don't want a husband.

665
01:03:47,455 --> 01:03:50,061
I wouldn't know
what to do with a husband.

666
01:03:50,191 --> 01:03:53,866
I just want to raise a child
on my own,

667
01:03:53,995 --> 01:03:57,204
and I'm looking
for a good genetic father.

668
01:03:58,833 --> 01:04:00,176
And?

669
01:04:02,337 --> 01:04:03,782
You.

670
01:04:07,142 --> 01:04:09,281
Wow, Alice, that's...

671
01:04:10,812 --> 01:04:12,689
That's really advanced societally.

672
01:04:12,814 --> 01:04:14,885
No, that's really progressive.

673
01:04:15,717 --> 01:04:16,787
You should think
about cloning yourself.

674
01:04:16,918 --> 01:04:18,363
You could raise
little mistress triplets.

675
01:04:18,486 --> 01:04:20,488
That's even more progressive.

676
01:04:20,622 --> 01:04:22,101
I'm serious.

677
01:04:23,258 --> 01:04:25,204
I think you'd be the best.

678
01:04:27,329 --> 01:04:28,433
Why?

679
01:04:30,665 --> 01:04:32,440
I'm short, I'm shortsighted,

680
01:04:32,567 --> 01:04:34,808
I have allergies, um...

681
01:04:34,936 --> 01:04:37,075
I like the way you write.

682
01:08:10,652 --> 01:08:12,632
Can I ask you, um,

683
01:08:12,754 --> 01:08:15,633
would you mind awfully
if I borrowed your goggles?

684
01:08:15,757 --> 01:08:17,395
Mine have broken.

685
01:08:21,062 --> 01:08:22,598
Thank you.

686
01:08:38,446 --> 01:08:39,447
It's a bit hot.

687
01:08:39,581 --> 01:08:41,788
Would you mind if I joined you?

688
01:08:41,916 --> 01:08:43,452
Would you mind?

689
01:08:48,456 --> 01:08:49,799
I'm really sorry.

690
01:08:51,025 --> 01:08:53,198
Please, accept my apologies.

691
01:08:54,162 --> 01:08:56,301
I'd feel really embarrassed
if you left.

692
01:08:57,665 --> 01:08:59,338
Really embarrassed.

693
01:09:08,509 --> 01:09:10,250
By the way, I'm Dominique.

694
01:09:12,380 --> 01:09:13,415
Sean.

695
01:09:13,548 --> 01:09:15,152
Nice to meet you, Sean.

696
01:09:17,785 --> 01:09:18,855
Is it a good book?

697
01:09:23,224 --> 01:09:25,295
Can you read me a bit?

698
01:09:28,363 --> 01:09:30,001
Just, you know,

699
01:09:30,131 --> 01:09:32,543
a sentence at random.

700
01:09:32,667 --> 01:09:33,702
It works.

701
01:09:33,835 --> 01:09:34,836
At random?

702
01:09:34,969 --> 01:09:36,607
At random.

703
01:09:39,374 --> 01:09:42,014
Okay.

704
01:09:42,143 --> 01:09:45,750
Third line
from the top of page 99.

705
01:09:55,923 --> 01:09:57,960
"When analytic thought, the knife,

706
01:09:58,092 --> 01:10:00,038
"is applied to experience,

707
01:10:00,161 --> 01:10:02,641
"something is always killed
in the process."

708
01:10:06,367 --> 01:10:09,507
See? It works.

709
01:10:10,638 --> 01:10:11,639
Yeah.

710
01:11:04,392 --> 01:11:06,372
So, you just move
into the building?

711
01:11:06,494 --> 01:11:09,270
No, I'm here for the weekend.

712
01:11:09,397 --> 01:11:10,967
Yeah? Is it
your first time in New York?

713
01:11:15,703 --> 01:11:16,773
What's your first impression?

714
01:11:16,904 --> 01:11:18,815
Good.

715
01:11:18,940 --> 01:11:20,180
Great.

716
01:11:22,243 --> 01:11:23,551
Unpredictable.

717
01:11:26,280 --> 01:11:27,953
Maybe it's not even the city.

718
01:11:29,550 --> 01:11:31,689
Maybe we're all

719
01:11:31,819 --> 01:11:33,662
less predictable in new places.

720
01:11:35,189 --> 01:11:37,191
Routine is the enemy.

721
01:11:40,862 --> 01:11:44,207
Come on, go for it.

722
01:11:44,332 --> 01:11:47,074
<i>Relax. Lighten up</i>

723
01:11:47,201 --> 01:11:49,408
I guess some routines aren't bad.

724
01:11:49,537 --> 01:11:52,450
You know,
like swimming every day.

725
01:11:52,573 --> 01:11:57,318
Or meditating like the Dalai Lama.

726
01:11:57,445 --> 01:12:00,483
Not getting much better.

727
01:12:00,615 --> 01:12:02,959
<i>We've got to change gear.</i>

728
01:12:10,057 --> 01:12:12,867
Have you ever read
"The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying"?

729
01:12:13,928 --> 01:12:17,535
<i>Shit, it's getting worse.</i>

730
01:12:17,665 --> 01:12:20,077
<i>What if I took
my swimming suit off?</i>

731
01:12:21,335 --> 01:12:23,315
I mean, it's great.

732
01:12:25,506 --> 01:12:27,179
<i>What the fuck
am I talking about?</i>

733
01:12:28,843 --> 01:12:31,323
<i>I need to lighten up</i>

734
01:12:31,445 --> 01:12:32,549
Or maybe not.

735
01:12:32,680 --> 01:12:34,159
<i>Maybe she is interested.</i>

736
01:12:34,282 --> 01:12:36,922
<i>No, I can't take it off</i>

737
01:12:37,051 --> 01:12:38,257
<i>It'll freak him out.</i>

738
01:12:41,022 --> 01:12:43,195
<i>I'll just change position.</i>

739
01:12:53,134 --> 01:12:54,579
<i>Shit. She's doing stretches now.</i>

740
01:12:54,702 --> 01:12:56,113
<i>She's getting bored.</i>

741
01:12:58,673 --> 01:13:00,516
<i>Fuck, I think I'm getting hard.</i>

742
01:13:00,641 --> 01:13:02,621
<i>I got to get out of here.</i>

743
01:13:04,178 --> 01:13:07,557
Anyway, it was great
to meet you, Dominique.

744
01:13:07,682 --> 01:13:09,161
I'll see you around.

745
01:13:14,322 --> 01:13:15,323
Sean?

746
01:13:32,473 --> 01:13:34,009
Was there a lot of blood?

747
01:13:37,478 --> 01:13:39,321
It does that. It's okay.

748
01:13:40,381 --> 01:13:43,260
He doesn't look worried.

749
01:13:43,384 --> 01:13:44,795
It's just a cut.

750
01:13:49,257 --> 01:13:52,101
So, it's Dominique, right?

751
01:13:52,226 --> 01:13:54,536
Right. It's coming back?

752
01:13:55,663 --> 01:14:00,271
Yeah. How long was I out?

753
01:14:00,401 --> 01:14:03,075
Not long. How are you feeling?

754
01:14:03,204 --> 01:14:05,115
Stupid.

755
01:14:05,239 --> 01:14:06,547
Does it hurt?

756
01:14:07,909 --> 01:14:09,388
No, not much.

757
01:14:09,510 --> 01:14:11,114
It should, shouldn't it?

758
01:14:12,046 --> 01:14:14,185
See? Your brain is coming back.

759
01:14:14,315 --> 01:14:17,660
In fact,
you're a bit smarter than before.

760
01:14:20,087 --> 01:14:21,862
Wait a minute,
so what happened?

761
01:14:23,491 --> 01:14:24,561
You slipped.

762
01:14:24,692 --> 01:14:26,103
I slipped?

763
01:14:28,562 --> 01:14:29,597
Did you see me?

764
01:14:30,698 --> 01:14:31,904
I was there.

765
01:14:33,034 --> 01:14:35,913
Wait. You were there?

766
01:14:36,037 --> 01:14:38,108
- I was there.
- Hey, don't do that.

767
01:14:39,206 --> 01:14:40,651
I slipped?

768
01:14:43,544 --> 01:14:45,319
Wait, did--

769
01:14:45,446 --> 01:14:46,982
Did we go all the way?

770
01:14:50,117 --> 01:14:51,755
Well, how was it?

771
01:14:57,758 --> 01:14:59,135
Your father just arrived.

772
01:15:00,194 --> 01:15:01,468
You know my father?

773
01:15:01,595 --> 01:15:03,973
I found his number
in your phone,

774
01:15:04,098 --> 01:15:05,577
and I called him.

775
01:15:07,902 --> 01:15:09,404
How was it?

776
01:15:11,405 --> 01:15:12,475
It was good.

777
01:15:16,477 --> 01:15:17,888
Not bad at all.

778
01:15:24,285 --> 01:15:25,593
Hold that cab!

779
01:15:27,855 --> 01:15:28,959
Thank you.

780
01:15:29,090 --> 01:15:30,125
You coming home with me?

781
01:15:30,257 --> 01:15:31,565
They said it was okay
if I walked.

782
01:15:31,692 --> 01:15:34,138
I think I'm gonna go for a walk.

783
01:15:34,261 --> 01:15:35,137
I'll see you at home.

784
01:15:35,262 --> 01:15:36,263
Okay, bye. I love you.

785
01:15:36,397 --> 01:15:37,876
I love you too, Dad.

786
01:16:58,779 --> 01:16:59,985
What are you listening to?

787
01:17:00,114 --> 01:17:01,616
Don't worry about it.

788
01:17:04,285 --> 01:17:05,559
Come on. What?

789
01:17:17,698 --> 01:17:19,268
So what happened to you?

790
01:17:19,400 --> 01:17:20,777
You disappeared.

791
01:17:23,270 --> 01:17:24,715
I was actually at the hospital.

792
01:17:24,839 --> 01:17:26,682
Had to get some stitches.

793
01:17:28,242 --> 01:17:29,778
Show me.

794
01:17:34,115 --> 01:17:37,028
Whoa, dude.

795
01:17:37,151 --> 01:17:39,757
And they made
you stay there for three days?

796
01:17:39,887 --> 01:17:42,163
Yeah, doing
scans or tests or whatever.

797
01:17:42,289 --> 01:17:44,064
I mean, it's all fine, though.

798
01:17:44,191 --> 01:17:45,864
What happened?

799
01:17:45,993 --> 01:17:47,700
Anything interesting?

800
01:17:50,064 --> 01:17:51,509
Tell me.

801
01:17:51,632 --> 01:17:54,875
Nothing.
I slipped at the pool.

802
01:17:56,003 --> 01:17:59,075
Okay.
Well, I got something to tell.

803
01:18:05,846 --> 01:18:07,450
I'm not a virgin anymore.

804
01:18:11,852 --> 01:18:13,490
I thought you didn't
want to do it with Jack.

805
01:18:13,621 --> 01:18:14,998
I didn't.

806
01:18:16,690 --> 01:18:17,691
It wasn't him.

807
01:18:22,163 --> 01:18:24,040
- Wow.
- Yeah.

808
01:18:24,165 --> 01:18:25,644
Does he know?

809
01:18:25,766 --> 01:18:27,439
No.

810
01:18:27,568 --> 01:18:29,605
You think I should tell him?

811
01:18:34,675 --> 01:18:39,749
Unless you stay
very strictly abstinent.

812
01:18:45,753 --> 01:18:47,027
So, what are you, like...

813
01:18:47,154 --> 01:18:48,827
You in love with this new guy?

814
01:18:49,990 --> 01:18:52,971
I thought I was, kind of.

815
01:18:54,662 --> 01:18:56,869
But I'm not. It's weird.

816
01:18:58,999 --> 01:19:00,672
Maybe you're ready
for something different.

817
01:19:00,801 --> 01:19:04,214
You know,
maybe you ought to try with me.

818
01:19:10,344 --> 01:19:11,846
You're kidding, right?

819
01:19:13,247 --> 01:19:14,885
Sean.
No, I can't do it with you.

820
01:19:15,015 --> 01:19:16,494
You're my best friend.

821
01:19:16,617 --> 01:19:17,721
So'?

822
01:19:20,588 --> 01:19:21,999
No, Sean.

823
01:19:22,122 --> 01:19:25,262
Everybody knows you can't
do it with your best friend.

824
01:19:25,392 --> 01:19:26,462
It fucks everything up.

825
01:19:26,594 --> 01:19:29,575
Can you imagine you and me
in some horrible sex position?

826
01:19:30,698 --> 01:19:33,269
Come on, Sean, stop.

827
01:19:33,400 --> 01:19:37,348
No. It'd be
a really stupid thing to do.

828
01:19:39,573 --> 01:19:43,111
Okay. It was just an idea.

829
01:20:14,241 --> 01:20:16,380
I've been thinking
about what you said yesterday.

830
01:20:17,745 --> 01:20:19,088
About what?

831
01:20:20,080 --> 01:20:21,150
About you...

832
01:20:23,884 --> 01:20:24,885
and me...

833
01:20:27,454 --> 01:20:28,899
doing it together.

834
01:20:31,759 --> 01:20:33,432
Listen, I'm sorry.

835
01:20:33,560 --> 01:20:34,595
It was a dumb idea.

836
01:20:34,728 --> 01:20:36,366
I was just sort of jerking around.

837
01:20:36,497 --> 01:20:38,170
Well, I changed my mind.

838
01:20:40,301 --> 01:20:41,678
I think you're right.

839
01:20:42,670 --> 01:20:44,650
I think we should try.

840
01:20:44,772 --> 01:20:47,412
No, you're the one that's right.

841
01:20:47,541 --> 01:20:50,647
When you're friends,
it just fucks everything up.

842
01:20:50,778 --> 01:20:53,418
No, listen,
I've been thinking about it.

843
01:20:55,449 --> 01:20:56,985
It'd be your first time.

844
01:20:58,152 --> 01:21:00,029
- No, it wouldn't.
- Yes, it would.

845
01:21:01,722 --> 01:21:03,292
I know that it would.

846
01:21:03,424 --> 01:21:05,233
What, did it happen
when you were at the hospital?

847
01:21:08,662 --> 01:21:10,403
I think it's really cool to do it

848
01:21:10,531 --> 01:21:12,272
with your best friend
for the first time.

849
01:21:13,467 --> 01:21:16,448
It's the time you remember
for the rest of your life.

850
01:21:16,570 --> 01:21:18,572
You don't want to remember me
for the rest of your life?

851
01:21:20,507 --> 01:21:22,817
Stop it. I told you, okay?

852
01:21:22,943 --> 01:21:25,116
- It wouldn't be my first time.
- Yeah, okay.

853
01:21:28,015 --> 01:21:29,926
We can't do it, Julie.

854
01:21:30,050 --> 01:21:31,222
It'd be too weird.

855
01:21:31,352 --> 01:21:32,490
It'd be like...

856
01:21:32,619 --> 01:21:34,530
It'd be like between
brother and sister.

857
01:21:35,723 --> 01:21:37,100
Only we're not.

858
01:21:39,827 --> 01:21:40,999
We're best friends, okay?

859
01:21:41,128 --> 01:21:44,007
That's not the same
as being in love.

860
01:21:44,131 --> 01:21:46,168
Yeah, but that's just the point.

861
01:21:46,300 --> 01:21:49,747
If we were in love,
it would have to be serious.

862
01:21:49,870 --> 01:21:51,872
It wouldn't
just be for the experience.

863
01:21:53,640 --> 01:21:55,745
When you're not in love,
it's different.

864
01:21:56,777 --> 01:21:58,017
It's cool.
