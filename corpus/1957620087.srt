00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:56,600
Oh yeah the vette. What's the fucking story on this kid?

183
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:57,440
He's been in and out of

184
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,060
juvenile correctional facility since his teens.

185
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,920
He had his first Grand Theft Auto

186
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:05,800
at 11 and then again at 13 and 16.

187
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:08,080
Yeah? So he's never been in the joint.

188
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,620
I guess after all that practice as a minor he got

189
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:14,100
his act together. Record's spotless.

190
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,640
Not even a speeding ticket.

191
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,360
No rape. No nothing.

192
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,220
He eventually lost

193
00:16:18,329 --> 00:16:21,990
all his sponsors so after dropping out

194
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:25,640
of the Pro Nascar race circuit he became a DD expert.

195
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:30,220
A DD. VD, DD what the

196
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,460
fuck is a DD?

197
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:34,320
Uhh... demolition derby. You know

198
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:38,160
destruction derby? You know it's a bunch a

199
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:40,240
junkers get together. About a dozen of

200
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,879
them and they Ram each other till only one's

201
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,651
left running. I guess that's the winner.

202
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:47,040
And apparently the kids been undefeated

203
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:49,750
for last few seasons.

204
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:50,680
And?

205
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:52,400
Not much.

206
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:58,460
No record. No family. His Mom died when is was 5.

207
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:01,900
His Dad got killed racing Nascar in some Raceway

208
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:04,420
in the middle of nowhere about 10 years ago.

209
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:07,580
And you know that guy Jerry?

210
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:08,900
The fag? The hairdresser?

211
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:11,960
Yeah... no no not the fag.

212
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,540
The guy that runs the repair shop.

213
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:14,180
Oh.

214
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:17,300
That clown. He used to be on the old

215
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:20,631
man's pit crew for years.

216
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:24,260
sounds perfect

217

[Funky, hip music starts up aging.]

218
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,100
Bring my car?

219
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:53,380
All finished.

220
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,560
Let's talk business.

221
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:58,340
I got a little job for ya.

222
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:02,300
You do it and I'll forget about the liquor store the other night.

223
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,080
What's the job?

224
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:07,360
Not much. I want you to pick up this little red Ferrari

225
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:09,580
and bring it to me. I'll give you four thousand dollars.

226
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:12,960
Four thousand dollars?

227
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,580
Here's the address.

228
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:21,400
If the front gate is open you can just drive it right out.

229
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:24,340
If not you might have to use some skill.

230
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:29,460
A little repo job. No problem. When?

231
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:31,680
As soon as possible.

232
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,620
My driver will drop you off near the house.

233
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,180
OK.

234
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:40,080
You gonna send him to Larry's place?

235
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,360
A little assignment before the main event.

236
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:45,510
He'll never make it through Larry's security.

237
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:47,600
You don't think so?

238
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,260
Umm... we'll see.

[The Music is low but tapping.]

251
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:30,600

Wow, this your car?

257
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:41,940
Hey. I never got your name.

258
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:44,320
We should charge you more for this one.

259
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,340
For what?

260
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:47,980
Well cleaning cars is one thing but uhh...

261
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:50,020
laundry is extra.

262
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:51,240
Hee hee.

263
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:53,640
You really should watch what cars you hang out with.

264
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,460
A lot of rust and disease out there.

265
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:57,040
Well I'll keep that in mind...

266

267

Jim, well that's a uhh... That's a guy's name isn't it?

Not Jim. Gem as in precious stones like

Well Gem, I'm Jim. Jimmy.

Oh shit...

Your boyfriend seems like a real dick.

276
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:22,640
Well actually dick is his name and

277
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:24,840
unfortunately his disposition.

278

Excuse me I gotta make my great escape.

279
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:28,460
Nice to meet you.

280

281
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:31,900

282

No. My name's not asshole. Dick.

Here's some good advice.

290

[Funky music starts up.]

292
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:52,640
So no problem?

294

Ha ha ha.

295
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,720
Larry will get over it.

I like you kid. I'd like you to drive for me.

298

You just did use a driver like me.

Ha ha ha.

300
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:16,410
What I don't understand is... it looks like you

301
00:30:16,410 --> 00:30:17,860
could afford your own Ferrari.

302
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:20,140
Well that goes without saying...

303
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:23,220
You know that guy Larry and I...

304
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,960
We were business partners. And there is

305
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:28,260
still some unfinished business. That

306
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:31,940
Ferrari is just sort of a means to an end.

307
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:34,120
I still say that I like you kid.

308
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:36,000
And I'd like you to drive for me but I'd like you to

309
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:38,640
drive for me on more of a permanent basis.

310
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:41,280
Well I don't like anything permanent.

311
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:42,800
I like to keep moving.

312
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:45,020
So that means you don't want to work for me?

313
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:47,300
I didn't say that.

314
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:51,960
I guess I could come on as sort of a

... temp.

00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,380

324
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:17,460
Well, technically, wouldn't be borrowing from the cops.

It's in a little tow yard.

326

There wouldn't be any cops for miles around.

327
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,300
Technically cops. That'll cost extra.

00:32:58,700 --> 00:32:59,740
Good. Real good.

00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:27,100
How much you getting?

548
00:51:27,100 --> 00:51:28,020
Twenty thousand.

549
00:51:28,060 --> 00:51:29,540
Twenty Thousand for delivering a car?

550
00:51:29,540 --> 00:51:33,480
Look I don't know. It's the boss's favorite ride or something.

551
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:41,360
So where's it stashed? that was what's there any kind

552
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:42,520
Where is what stashed?

553
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:44,000
We need to find the shit.

554
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:44,800
What shit?

555
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:45,680
Look if they're paying you

556
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:47,810
20 thou for delivering this car there's gotta be

557
00:51:47,810 --> 00:51:50,100
something in here worth millions.

558
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:53,060
Good point.

559
00:51:53,540 --> 00:52:09,860
[Slow deep ominous music plays.]

560
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:12,020
Oh well now that's interesting.

561
00:52:12,180 --> 00:52:13,120
What?

562
00:52:13,120 --> 00:52:14,860
Nothing. Just keep looking.

563
00:52:15,100 --> 00:52:45,040
[The slow deep ominous music continues.]

564
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:47,320
Look this is pointless. If the cops

565
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:49,400
couldn't find it... how are we?

566
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:52,160
So you have no idea what we're looking for? I mean...

567
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:54,120
It could be disguised as part of the car.

568
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,060
You know... In my opinion you're being screwed.

569
00:52:57,160 --> 00:52:58,500
They know you're a nickle and dime theif

570
00:52:58,500 --> 00:53:00,360
and they're exploiting you.

571
00:53:00,420 --> 00:53:02,020
Yeah well $20,000....

572
00:53:02,140 --> 00:53:04,440
That's a lot of nickels and dimes.

573
00:53:04,620 --> 00:53:06,380
Maybe my friends can help.

574
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:08,360
Wanna see where I live?

575
00:53:08,940 --> 00:53:10,220
Sure.

576
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:46,260
[Sneaky Music plays.]

577
00:53:46,820 --> 00:53:48,040
Hey, is this where you live?

578
00:53:48,180 --> 00:53:49,440
Yeah. Why?

579
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:52,000
It figures. You said you were a drifter.

580
00:53:56,660 --> 00:53:57,820
Hey.

581
00:53:58,900 --> 00:54:01,020
This is Jo my roomy and this is Kiki.

582
00:54:01,180 --> 00:54:02,060
Hey.

583
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:05,000
Dick was just here.

584
00:54:05,140 --> 00:54:06,940
Well Dick and I are through.

585
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:10,660
This is Jim. He's uhh... Driver's Ed teacher.

586
00:54:10,660 --> 00:54:12,920
Wow... sounds like another perfect match for you.

587
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:14,300
Well if you're broken up you better tell me cause

588
00:54:14,300 --> 00:54:15,520
he's really pissed off.

589
00:54:15,660 --> 00:54:16,720
You tell him. He's your brother.

590
00:54:16,740 --> 00:54:17,700
Well he's your boyfriend.

591
00:54:17,700 --> 00:54:20,480
Well you introduced us so you break it off.

592
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:22,780
Oh... by the way...

593
00:54:22,980 --> 00:54:24,140
If you two had your hands on

594
00:54:24,140 --> 00:54:26,660
something really valuable, would you give away for

595
00:54:26,660 --> 00:54:28,880
a little money or would you hold out for the big bucks?

596
00:54:29,140 --> 00:54:30,980
Well is there danger involved?

597
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:32,420
Possibly.

598
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:33,800
Go for the big bucks.

599
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:34,820
Told you.

600
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:36,020
Fixed vote.

601
00:54:36,020 --> 00:54:38,060
So what do we tell asshole when he shows up?

602
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:39,340
Tell him...

603
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:40,880
That she's with me.

604
00:54:41,180 --> 00:54:43,800
[Upbeat music starts.]

605
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:44,900
Big gun.

606
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:47,560
See ya.

607
00:54:48,120 --> 00:54:49,400
Bye ladies.

608
00:54:49,540 --> 00:55:00,600
[Hopeful music continues to play.]

609
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:04,160
Keller? It's Jim. I got your car.

610
00:55:04,489 --> 00:55:06,140
You tell me that one more time and I'll

611
00:55:06,140 --> 00:55:08,980
shoot you in the fucking head I swear to god.

612
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:11,980
Well it was a little more difficult than I anticipated.

613
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:14,320
Where the hell are you?

614
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:16,759
I think I'm going to need more bread.

615
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:18,520
How much more?

616
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:19,820
Well, a lot.

617
00:55:21,140 --> 00:55:22,120
You bring me that car in one

618
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:24,530
piece I'll give you 40 grand.

619
00:55:24,700 --> 00:55:25,800
40?

620
00:55:26,020 --> 00:55:28,720
No... That was way too fast. The shit must be worth millions.

621
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:29,400
Shhh.

622
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:30,700
Tell him to add a zero to your salary.

623
00:55:30,700 --> 00:55:32,060
Shut up and go over there.

624
00:55:32,060 --> 00:55:33,080
Let me handle this.

625
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:35,260
If he doesn't cooperate tell him you're gonna take the car apart.

626
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:35,860
go.

627
00:55:35,860 --> 00:55:36,980
I know what I'm talking about Jim.

628
00:55:36,980 --> 00:55:39,380
[Ferry horn blows in the distance.]

629
00:55:40,900 --> 00:55:43,780
I know that fery whistle Frank.

630
00:55:43,780 --> 00:55:45,640
The kid's at Fisherman's Wharf

631
00:55:45,700 --> 00:55:48,240
just north of Santa Barbara.

632
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:49,900
Go get the Vette.

633
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:52,820
and kill him.

634
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:54,860
Listen Keller...

635
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:57,080
You're going to have to add a zero to that 40.

636
00:55:57,200 --> 00:55:59,260
Getting a little greedy aren't you kid?

637
00:55:59,420 --> 00:56:02,500
Well possession is nine-tenths of the law.

638
00:56:03,540 --> 00:56:06,080
You've got something I want...

639
00:56:06,660 --> 00:56:08,820
and I've got something you want.

640
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:10,880
I'm gonna want it in 20' & 50's.

641
00:56:11,020 --> 00:56:12,120
[Chuckles.]

642
00:56:12,420 --> 00:56:14,020
[Phone rings.]

643
00:56:14,140 --> 00:56:15,940
Well of course you do.

644
00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:17,960
I've got the kid in sight.

645
00:56:18,180 --> 00:56:19,060
Hey.

646
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:21,820
Gene's got a visual on the kid.

647
00:56:22,380 --> 00:56:24,620
Let me give you some advice...

648
00:56:25,140 --> 00:56:27,020
This world is full of surprises Jim.

649
00:56:29,060 --> 00:56:31,080
I've come across my share.

650
00:56:32,020 --> 00:56:34,840
I mean hell. I know people.

651
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:36,820
I thought I had you figured.

652
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:39,460
But you managed to surprise me.

653
00:56:40,060 --> 00:56:42,440
And that's a feat in itself.

654
00:56:43,460 --> 00:56:45,960
But I've learned something...

655
00:56:46,140 --> 00:56:48,260
No matter how big the surprises is...

656
00:56:48,460 --> 00:56:51,600
it's over pretty quickly.

657
00:56:52,020 --> 00:56:54,440
A guy is walking down the street...

658
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:57,780
Suddenly he gets shot in the head.

659
00:56:58,220 --> 00:57:02,680
Hell that's a surprise. A quick shock...

660
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:04,260
and it's all over.

661
00:57:05,140 --> 00:57:08,920
You see Jim... I found it much more effective

662
00:57:08,950 --> 00:57:12,310
and painful if the person who's going to

663
00:57:12,310 --> 00:57:16,270
be killed knows that in advance and

664
00:57:16,270 --> 00:57:19,620
there's stress, anxiety, panic,

665
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:20,340
Ha...

666
00:57:20,420 --> 00:57:24,720
Despair. Those are all the traits I look for in an

667
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:27,600
effect hit on a person that I hate.

668
00:57:28,820 --> 00:57:34,440
And guess what Jim? I really hate you.

669
00:57:34,940 --> 00:57:37,920
Look if you kill me you'll never find a car.

670
00:57:37,980 --> 00:57:42,020
Oh I think I will. I've already found you.

671
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:46,460
Panic is sitting in now isn't it Jim?

672
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:51,120
Look around... My man is there at

673
00:57:51,140 --> 00:57:53,120
fisherman's warf.

674
00:57:53,360 --> 00:57:54,380
[Chuckle.]

675
00:57:55,840 --> 00:57:58,860
Feel that stress building inside you?

676
00:57:59,860 --> 00:58:02,040
He's gonna kill you Jim.

677
00:58:03,140 --> 00:58:06,260
And I'm really going to enjoy it.

678
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,339
I can even feel your despair growing over the

679
00:58:10,340 --> 00:58:12,240
telephone lines.

680
00:58:12,580 --> 00:58:15,780
Well it's not over till it's over.

681
00:58:18,140 --> 00:58:19,300
Gem.

682
00:58:21,420 --> 00:58:23,440
Pretend like you're waiting to use the phone.

683
00:58:23,560 --> 00:58:24,920
This guy in the car back here...

684
00:58:24,920 --> 00:58:26,200
He wants to kill me.

685
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:27,600
I'll meet you behind the restaurant.

686
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:28,800
Alright.

687
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:38,700
[Slow deadly music plays.]

688
00:58:38,700 --> 00:58:40,560
I don't see the car. I'm gonna have to

689
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:41,880
Follow the kid.

690
00:58:42,140 --> 01:00:14,560
[Mischievous sneaky music plays.]

691
01:00:14,900 --> 01:00:16,860
[The music stops.]

692
01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:49,460
[The music slowly fades back up.]

693
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:53,720
[Horns from oncoming cars honk.]

694
01:00:57,620 --> 01:03:51,900
[Faster more intense chase music plays.]

695
01:03:52,280 --> 01:03:53,840
Aaaahhhhh....

[Screams as he burns alive.]

698
01:04:19,040 --> 01:04:23,220
[Tires squeal.]

699
01:04:25,120 --> 01:04:28,080
Ask for 6 figures I know what I'm talking about.

700
01:04:28,260 --> 01:04:30,279
Hey, I didn't know they were such creeps.

701
01:04:30,300 --> 01:04:32,260
How was I supposed to know they were going to try to kill you?

702
01:04:32,260 --> 01:04:34,480
They're organize crime honey. That's what they do.

703
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:36,540
Well I didn't know that.

704
01:04:36,780 --> 01:04:39,060
You know I don't work for them.

705
01:04:39,400 --> 01:04:42,160
OK, I'll take the blame. You just figure a way out.

706
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:45,460
Alright, I got a plan...

707
01:04:45,780 --> 01:04:47,560
A bit of a long shot though.

708
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:48,720
OK.

709
01:04:52,040 --> 01:04:56,200

[Intercom beeps.]

712
01:05:13,100 --> 01:05:13,940
Yeah?

713
01:05:14,140 --> 01:05:15,380
Yeah is Larry in?

714
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:18,300
Larry's not seeing any visitors today.

715
01:05:18,760 --> 01:05:20,340
Yeah, well he will want to see me.

716
01:05:20,540 --> 01:05:21,600
Who are you?

717
01:05:21,600 --> 01:05:23,780
Tell him the guy that stole his Ferrari is here.

718
01:05:23,940 --> 01:05:37,740
[The military drum music plays again.]

719
01:05:38,020 --> 01:05:39,940
Well, what do you think?

720
01:05:40,120 --> 01:05:43,400
It's nice. Fancy. But it doesn't float.

721
01:05:43,620 --> 01:05:53,640
[The military drums continue to beat.]

722
01:05:59,560 --> 01:06:01,440
Not to question you're ability Jim but...

723
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:03,380
I'm starting to have doubts about this plan of yours.

724
01:06:03,520 --> 01:06:05,260
Just keep cool.

725
01:06:06,100 --> 01:06:07,640
Have a seat.

726
01:06:12,920 --> 01:06:14,740
Excuse me. Have I see you two here

727
01:06:14,740 --> 01:06:16,440
before? I don't think so.

728
01:06:16,660 --> 01:06:18,080
Yeah likewise.

729
01:06:18,440 --> 01:06:21,800
Uhh... this happens to be my house.

730
01:06:22,060 --> 01:06:23,240
Can I help you?

731
01:06:23,300 --> 01:06:24,420
Will you shut up?

732
01:06:24,820 --> 01:06:26,180
Oh sorry bro.

733
01:06:26,180 --> 01:06:27,740
The best thing for you to do right now

734
01:06:27,800 --> 01:06:29,580
is just watch and listen.

735
01:06:29,580 --> 01:06:30,840
Don't get involved.

736
01:06:30,840 --> 01:06:31,680
You got it.

737
01:06:35,480 --> 01:06:36,580
So.

738
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:38,900
I understand you're the man that stole

739
01:06:38,900 --> 01:06:42,140
Crystal's Ferrari. Is that right?

740
01:06:42,800 --> 01:06:43,980
Not the greatest news

741
01:06:43,980 --> 01:06:48,640
to get coming off a plane I must admit.

742
01:06:48,940 --> 01:06:53,499
If you still have it... I want it back.

743
01:06:53,520 --> 01:06:56,880
Well, that's not going to happen.

744
01:06:57,020 --> 01:06:58,780
But I got something you might like.

745
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:00,260
What might that be?

746
01:07:01,460 --> 01:07:03,860
I've been working for Keller lately.

747
01:07:05,540 --> 01:07:09,420
Keller? Ha ha ha...

748
01:07:09,820 --> 01:07:11,340
Ha ha ha...

749
01:07:13,180 --> 01:07:15,140
Did you see his face?

750
01:07:15,460 --> 01:07:17,900
Ha. Ha ha ha ha...

751
01:07:19,820 --> 01:07:21,420
Kill them.

752
01:07:22,100 --> 01:07:22,760
Yeah.

753
01:07:22,820 --> 01:07:25,460
Does a blue Corvette mean anything to ya?

754
01:07:25,720 --> 01:07:29,420
[Mysterious music starts up.]

755
01:07:29,860 --> 01:07:32,160
Yeah... why?

756
01:07:33,780 --> 01:07:34,800
Well it just so happens that

757
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:36,220
I have it in my possession.

758
01:07:36,380 --> 01:07:37,420
You do?

759
01:07:37,420 --> 01:07:39,820
I stole it for Keller but I'm thinking I might give it

760
01:07:39,840 --> 01:07:41,430
to you instead.

761
01:07:41,430 --> 01:07:43,680
Listen, I don't think this guy knows what he's talkin'...

762
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:44,540
Shut up.

763
01:07:44,540 --> 01:07:45,180
OK.

764
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:47,600
You wanna trade your lives for a Corvette?

765
01:07:48,340 --> 01:07:49,400
Well...

766
01:07:50,120 --> 01:07:50,760
I was thinking about

767
01:07:50,760 --> 01:07:52,600
something a little better than that.

768
01:07:52,720 --> 01:07:56,140
How about our lives and... 200,000 dollars?

769
01:07:56,300 --> 01:07:57,560
Ha ha ha ha...

770
01:07:57,940 --> 01:07:59,620
That's very funny...

771
01:08:00,120 --> 01:08:01,260
Why would I want to pay for something

772
01:08:01,320 --> 01:08:03,060
I already own?

773
01:08:03,980 --> 01:08:06,180
Cut the crap. We'll trade the car and the

774
01:08:06,260 --> 01:08:08,020
shit inside the car.

775
01:08:11,120 --> 01:08:12,720
The package huh...

776
01:08:13,120 --> 01:08:14,620
You know about that?

777
01:08:15,380 --> 01:08:18,000
Yeah... and I think 200 thousand dollars is fair.

778
01:08:18,140 --> 01:08:19,480
It's gotta be worth millions.

779
01:08:20,460 --> 01:08:22,540
I didn't get your name... miss... uhh...

780
01:08:22,540 --> 01:08:24,280
Well if you had my name you'd be my father.

781
01:08:24,420 --> 01:08:26,920
Ho ho ho... that's very funny.

782
01:08:26,920 --> 01:08:27,980
Larry honey?

783
01:08:28,260 --> 01:08:29,100
Yeah?

784
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:31,500
I'm going for a swim. Wanna join me?

785
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:32,860
In a minute.

786
01:08:33,040 --> 01:08:35,900
Meet the guy who uhh... stole your car honey.

787
01:08:37,740 --> 01:08:39,800
Kill 'em.

788
01:08:40,660 --> 01:08:41,980
Ha ha ha ha...

789
01:08:42,220 --> 01:08:44,480
You kill us... the deal's off.

790
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,380
Uhh... Deal? Excuse me but...

791
01:08:47,580 --> 01:08:48,960
there is no deal.

792
01:08:50,420 --> 01:08:52,560
I'm not gonna pay for something twice.

793
01:08:53,760 --> 01:08:56,020
As long as I know the car is in LA...

794
01:08:57,820 --> 01:08:59,980
Well my men will find it.

795
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,620
Not if Keller's men find it first.

796
01:09:03,060 --> 01:09:07,900
Keller's a little maggot, I intend to squash, very hard.

797
01:09:09,020 --> 01:09:13,020
You wanna know who runs this town? You're looking at him.

798
01:09:14,220 --> 01:09:16,540
So if you'll excuse me... I got things to do.

799
01:09:17,300 --> 01:09:19,000
Just kill them painlessly.

800
01:09:19,560 --> 01:09:22,080
I don't penalize stupidity.

801
01:09:22,240 --> 01:09:24,440
See, see he's a giving person and that's

802
01:09:24,460 --> 01:09:25,920
why i love him.

803
01:09:26,340 --> 01:09:27,840
Let me ask you something...

804
01:09:27,840 --> 01:09:29,400
If you run this town how come you

805
01:09:29,400 --> 01:09:32,580
can't stop your old lady from fucking everybody?

806
01:09:33,020 --> 01:09:34,460
Whoa...

807
01:09:34,600 --> 01:09:35,560
Excuse me?

808
01:09:36,080 --> 01:09:38,800
Now just what the fuck is that supposed to mean?

809
01:09:40,140 --> 01:09:41,540
You're lying. He's lying.

810
01:09:41,540 --> 01:09:42,820
Hey. Shut up.

811
01:09:42,900 --> 01:09:45,060
We've been having a good time up to now...

812
01:09:45,060 --> 01:09:47,160
You want to die rough... I can work that out.

813
01:09:47,640 --> 01:09:49,080
But you said the wrong thing.

814
01:09:49,160 --> 01:09:51,260
If you got anything to back it up...

815
01:09:51,940 --> 01:09:53,340
I want to hear it right now.

816
01:09:53,520 --> 01:09:56,960

possible. I mean you know these guys man.

They're here every day. There's no way it's one of them.

849

01:15:37,100 --> 01:15:39,660
No. What you do is you send someone else.

912
01:15:39,660 --> 01:15:42,740
A third-party to pick it up.

913
01:15:43,240 --> 01:15:46,820
And when you think it's cool, you call me and tell me

914
01:15:46,840 --> 01:15:49,080
when you'll bring my vette down to the warehouse.

915
01:15:50,200 --> 01:15:52,620
OK, that sounds doable.

916
01:15:52,640 --> 01:15:54,320
Just tell me where and when you want the first half of

917
01:15:54,320 --> 01:15:56,020
the money. I'll be there.

918
01:15:56,120 --> 01:15:59,260
The alley behind the bank at 5th and Brooks.

919
01:16:00,080 --> 01:16:01,440
One hour.

920
01:16:02,580 --> 01:16:04,080
What about Larry?

921
01:16:04,860 --> 01:16:06,060
Watch.

922
01:16:06,980 --> 01:16:18,060
[Dial tone, phone beeps, ringing.]

923
01:16:18,660 --> 01:16:20,200
It's for you sir.

924
01:16:21,180 --> 01:16:22,480
Thanks Mike.

925
01:16:22,560 --> 01:16:24,780
Hey Mike could you get me a glass of white wine please.

926
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:27,540
Hey what's your problem? Don't be telling

927
01:16:27,570 --> 01:16:28,710
people what to do.

928
01:16:28,710 --> 01:16:30,510
Just shut up and read your magazine.

929
01:16:30,510 --> 01:16:31,860
He hasn't done anything wrong why you picking on...

930
01:16:31,860 --> 01:16:33,420
Hey what did I say?

931
01:16:38,340 --> 01:16:39,560
[Phone beeps.]

932
01:16:40,740 --> 01:16:41,800
Yeah.

933
01:16:42,240 --> 01:16:45,300
Alright, here's the deal. I want half the money delivered

934
01:16:45,300 --> 01:16:47,190
at the Springsteen mall.

935
01:16:47,200 --> 01:16:49,620
I'll have somebody waiting out front for ya.

936
01:16:50,660 --> 01:16:52,120
Then you get your car back three

937
01:16:52,120 --> 01:16:55,040
hours later at 740 Molten Avenue.

938
01:16:56,100 --> 01:16:58,600
OK, I know the place.

939
01:16:58,600 --> 01:16:59,420
Bring the rest of

940
01:16:59,460 --> 01:17:01,860
the cash with you and the car is all yours.

941
01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:05,060
Alright. I want the name.

942
01:17:05,500 --> 01:17:07,340
Na. At the warehouse.

943
01:17:08,080 --> 01:17:10,720
Bring your guards and I'll point out which one.

944
01:17:12,840 --> 01:17:16,180
Alright. I'm looking forward to it.

945
01:17:16,680 --> 01:17:17,720
[Phone beeps.]

946
01:17:22,840 --> 01:17:25,660
Four more hours sweetheart.

947
01:17:25,719 --> 01:17:28,719
no more secrets

948
01:17:33,460 --> 01:17:34,860
I hope you know what you're doing.

949
01:17:34,880 --> 01:17:37,160
You thought that I was being greedy.

950
01:17:37,160 --> 01:17:39,160
Look if everything goes as planned

951
01:17:39,160 --> 01:17:42,100
we're going to be 225,000 dollars richer.

952
01:17:42,960 --> 01:17:47,880
You just made deals for 450,000 can't you count?

953
01:17:47,900 --> 01:17:50,020
Look these guys want to kill me...

954
01:17:50,540 --> 01:17:52,180
and eventually they're going to succeed.

955
01:17:52,460 --> 01:17:55,020
Unless they kill each other first.

956
01:17:55,060 --> 01:17:58,320
Yeah and where are we gonna be?

957
01:17:58,620 --> 01:18:00,360
Out of town hopefully.

958
01:18:02,780 --> 01:18:05,760
Oh. What about the car?

959
01:18:08,500 --> 01:18:11,040
We'll just let them fight it out.

960
01:18:11,040 --> 01:18:12,380
You're a smart guy you know that?

961
01:18:12,500 --> 01:18:14,460
Why thank you.

962
01:18:15,080 --> 01:18:18,680
So I'm gonna go, I'm gonna pick up the money... and I'll meet you

963
01:18:18,700 --> 01:18:20,560
back here in two hours tops OK?

964
01:18:20,700 --> 01:18:22,340
Alright. You be careful.

965
01:18:22,340 --> 01:18:23,320
I will.

966
01:18:24,120 --> 01:18:27,580
Oh... by the way... I think I love you.

967
01:18:28,300 --> 01:18:29,340
Ditto.

968
01:18:33,040 --> 01:18:46,160
[Reggae music plays.]

969
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:47,540
Hey.

970
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:49,000
What are you doing here?

971
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:50,360
I got a favor to ask you.

972
01:18:50,360 --> 01:18:52,220
Yeah? Someone's looking for you.

973
01:18:55,660 --> 01:18:57,180
You didn't tell him?

974
01:18:57,660 --> 01:18:59,240
I did but he didn't take it too well.

975
01:18:59,240 --> 01:18:59,740
Jesus.

976
01:18:59,740 --> 01:19:01,360
Let's go. We're outta here.

977
01:19:01,360 --> 01:19:03,200
Look. It's over between us OK?

978
01:19:03,200 --> 01:19:05,800
It's over when I say it's over and not before.

979
01:19:05,800 --> 01:19:07,360
You need a clearer answer is that it?

980
01:19:08,920 --> 01:19:11,400
Is that clear enough for ya?

981
01:19:13,620 --> 01:19:15,380
Look, I'm sorry about that.

982
01:19:15,480 --> 01:19:17,740
I don't give a shit. He used to slap me around too.

983
01:19:17,740 --> 01:19:19,560
You think you can get off work for about an hour?

984
01:19:20,020 --> 01:19:21,620
Sure. What's up?

985
01:19:22,420 --> 01:19:24,040
I need you to help me on an errand so I

986
01:19:24,040 --> 01:19:26,440
can be in two places at once. You need to pick up

987
01:19:26,460 --> 01:19:28,780
a package & meet me back here in an hour.

988
01:19:29,220 --> 01:19:30,660
OK, I can handle that.

989
01:19:30,960 --> 01:19:31,960
Come on.

990
01:19:36,200 --> 01:19:37,820
Sam... cover for me.

991
01:19:38,040 --> 01:19:43,340
[The reggae music continues.]

992
01:19:43,560 --> 01:19:48,140
[Tense scary music starts.]

993
01:19:48,500 --> 01:19:51,160
Come on Gem. Where the hell are ya?

994
01:19:54,420 --> 01:20:02,380
[Dial tone, beeps, ringing.]

995
01:20:02,380 --> 01:20:05,420
Keller? It's Jim. What the hell happened?

996
01:20:05,420 --> 01:20:06,260
And where's the girl?

997
01:20:06,260 --> 01:20:07,180
And where's the money?

998
01:20:07,180 --> 01:20:09,800
I thought you were smarter and send someone you could trust?

999
01:20:10,060 --> 01:20:11,980
I trust her. What happened?

1000
01:20:12,280 --> 01:20:15,640
125,000 dollars is very tempting for some people.

1001
01:20:17,020 --> 01:20:19,000
I guess it was just a little too much for your

1002
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:20,320
girlfriend.

1003
01:20:20,700 --> 01:20:22,520
She wouldn't screw me.

1004
01:20:22,520 --> 01:20:24,740
That's how I felt about you.

1005
01:20:24,740 --> 01:20:26,580
But you never know these days.

1006
01:20:27,180 --> 01:20:28,720
Where the hell is she?

1007
01:20:28,880 --> 01:20:29,940
Look. She picked up the

1008
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:33,580
money and I had my boys follow her. Just in case.

1009
01:20:34,140 --> 01:20:37,140
Went right to the airport and bought a one way ticket to London.

1010
01:20:39,100 --> 01:20:40,920
I don't believe it.

1011
01:20:41,720 --> 01:20:43,179
So you didn't plan on her leaving the

1012
01:20:43,200 --> 01:20:45,091
country without you huh?

1013
01:20:47,380 --> 01:20:49,600
She's skipping out on you Pal.

1014
01:20:49,740 --> 01:20:51,420
No, I still don't believe it.

1015
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:55,720
You want my guys to take her down?

1016
01:20:57,900 --> 01:21:00,440
Listen if you want me to stop her...

1017
01:21:00,440 --> 01:21:01,460
You better decide

1018
01:21:01,480 --> 01:21:04,080
fast cause her plane takes off real soon.

1019
01:21:05,960 --> 01:21:06,980
No.

1020
01:21:07,900 --> 01:21:09,200
Let her go.

1021
01:21:10,740 --> 01:21:14,140
So you really do love her huh?

1022
01:21:15,080 --> 01:21:17,060
Well that makes things easier.

1023
01:21:21,320 --> 01:21:22,680
Make her scream.

1024
01:21:23,860 --> 01:21:25,300

[More female screams.]

1027
01:21:34,280 --> 01:21:35,580
Keller...

1028
01:21:36,080 --> 01:21:41,760
You hurt her... and I swear to god I'll kill you.

1029
01:21:43,660 --> 01:21:46,840
740 Multon Avenue.

1030
01:21:47,320 --> 01:21:49,180
I'll be there.

1031

1036

Get out.

1037
01:24:32,520 --> 01:24:33,660
What the hell is going on?

1038
01:24:33,660 --> 01:24:35,280
Well I'm here to end your life.

1039
01:24:35,300 --> 01:24:36,200
How are you?

1040
01:24:36,360 --> 01:24:38,920
Hey wait a minute. I know you. You're... you're...

1041
01:24:38,920 --> 01:24:39,960
Larry's little brother.

1042
01:24:40,060 --> 01:24:42,140
That's right. Congratulations you just won the

1043
01:24:42,140 --> 01:24:44,320
ten-thousand-dollar bonus round how do you feel?

1044
01:24:44,660 --> 01:24:45,940
Ha ha... you know it's funny. I was just about

1045
01:24:45,940 --> 01:24:46,860
to call him.

1046
01:24:46,860 --> 01:24:47,840
Yeah that is funny as a

1047
01:24:47,860 --> 01:24:49,210
matter of fact that just happens to be

1048
01:24:49,240 --> 01:24:50,860
why I'm here you see I could never let

1049
01:24:50,860 --> 01:24:52,810
that happen because if you called my

1050
01:24:52,810 --> 01:24:54,270
brother then he'd find out about me and

1051
01:24:54,270 --> 01:24:56,300
Crystal and then I'd be in deep shit

1052
01:24:56,320 --> 01:24:58,420
we wouldn't want that so you and crystal

1053
01:24:58,480 --> 01:25:00,560
So you and Crystal but she's...

1054
01:25:00,620 --> 01:25:02,260
A fine chick.

1055
01:25:02,500 --> 01:25:03,460
Well yeah.

1056
01:25:03,460 --> 01:25:05,480
Well you see the way I figured it is...

1057
01:25:05,480 --> 01:25:06,440
me and my brother were never very

1058
01:25:06,500 --> 01:25:10,310
close so... if I was with his girl... maybe we

1059
01:25:10,310 --> 01:25:12,070
could get a little bit closer family

1060
01:25:12,070 --> 01:25:14,420

1065

Well what the hell happened?

1066
01:26:11,300 --> 01:26:14,100
Well I picked up the money from Larry's men. See.

1067
01:26:14,260 --> 01:26:16,280
I had my friend Jo go to pick up Keller's money.

1068
01:26:16,500 --> 01:26:18,280
And she was supposed to meet me back at the bar but she

1069
01:26:18,280 --> 01:26:21,459
never showed. I wait for an hour and then I

1070
01:26:21,460 --> 01:26:24,460
went to the motel and you were gone. s So I came here.

1071

1081

You don't even know what power is Larry.

1144
01:33:41,960 --> 01:33:43,400

You got them.

1166
01:34:59,380 --> 01:35:01,740
And you're not gonna keep them either.

1167

Ain't no bluff.

Larry and Keller their adults.

1176
