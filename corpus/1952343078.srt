1
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,200
The Guyver unit.

2
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:26,800
It's been a year since the alien armor
invaded my body,

3
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,000
became a part of me.

4
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,800
A year since I first
became the Guyver

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,800
and destroyed
the Chronos Corporation

6
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,800
and their shape-changing killers,
the Zoanoids.

7
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:40,400
Now Chronos is gone,
but the Guyver stays in me,

8
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,600
calling me to fight...

9
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:43,800
to kill.

10
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,000
Damn.

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,400
Hurry up,
find that shit.

12
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Bingo.

13
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,400
Hey, DC.

14
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,400
Dolls?

15
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,800
The latest technology.

16
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:23,600
You mix cocaine with plastic,
you can shape it into anything you like.

17
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:28,000
Melt it back down,
it's 100% pure.

18
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,800
What the fuck was that?

19
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,200
- Benny, check it out.
- You got it.

20
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,000
You starting to regret
that career choice now?

21
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,600
There's nobody up here.

22
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,400
All right, girls, come on, let's hustle.
Let's go.

23
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,200
Let's go,
move it.

24
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,000
All set.

25
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,400
Benny, we're rollin'.

26
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,400
Hey, Benny,
I said we're rollin'.

27
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,800
Holy shit.

28
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,200
What the fuck is that?

29
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,400
Let the man go.

30
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,000
Yeah, right.
Fuck you.

31
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,000
Get him!

32
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,600
Shit.

33
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,000
Fuck. Stay away from me, man.
Stay the fuck away from me.

34
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,200
Don't! Oh!
No, please don't.

35
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,200
Please don't.
Please,

36
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,800
don't kill me,
just arrest me.

37
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,400
Holy shit.

38
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,000
This is Delta 28,

39
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,200
we have severely injured men
at 36th and California.

40
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,000
Request ambulance assistance
and back up.

41
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,800
Hey, Moran,
over here.

42
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,400
Shit.

43
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,600
Yeah, it's him, all right.

44
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:56,400
"inside Exposé,"
in Three Pines, Utah,

45
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:59,800
to investigate what may be
a werewolf attack.

46
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,600
Doug Kerlew
and his brother Jud

47
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,400
were exploring some caves
above these woods,

48
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:08,200
when Jud was attacked
and fatally mauled.

49
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,800
Rangers here are calling it
a bear attack,

50
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,600
but Doug has
a different explanation.

51
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,800
Yeah, I mean,
it changed. Yeah.

52
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,200
It was right before my eyes.

53
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,200
It was a man

54
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,400
and then it was a thing,

55
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,200
you see,
with teeth and claws.

56
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,000
Like one of those cave paintings
I showed you come to life.

57
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,400
No, I wasn't drunk.

58
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,000
You people
calling me a liar?

59
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,600
Man,
my brother's dead, man.

60
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,000
That ain't no lie.

61
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,000
When asked to describe
his attacker,

62
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,400
Doug gave us
this drawing,

63
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,400
which he says
is a copy of the painting

64
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,200
found on the cave wall.

65
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,200
This he claims
is what killed Jud Kerlew.

66
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:54,200
IE went looking for this cave
to verify Doug's story,

67
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,400
and we found it.

68
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,800
But an archeological expedition
investigating the cave

69
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:02,600
was suspiciously uncooperative
when we asked to shoot inside.

70
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:06,000
Next up,
more Elvis sightings.

71
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:16,200
...which he says is a copy
of the painting found on the cave wall.

72
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,800
Hi, Mizky.

73
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,800
Look...

74
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,200
I'm ready to try
to make things better.

75
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,800
I saw the papers
this morning.

76
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,800
It doesn't look
like anything's better.

77
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,800
I didn't come here
to talk about that.

78
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,800
The security guard
died, Sean.

79
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,400
And those gangsters.

80
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:59,400
How many people are you gonna have
to kill before you realize...

81
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,600
No, I don't kill...

82
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,600
It kills.

83
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:06,200
Sean, listen to yourself.

84
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:09,200
You've got to stop this.

85
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,400
It won't let me.

86
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,000
That's crazy.

87
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,400
I know,
and I want to end it.

88
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:18,000
Will you listen?

89
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
There was a thing on TV
this morning

90
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,600
About a werewolf
sighting in Utah.

91
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:25,400
Werewolves...
Zoanoids.

92
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:28,000
If you saw
Lisker or Balcus for the first time,

93
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,600
- what would you think?
- God! Stop it!

94
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,000
I don't want
to hear it anymore.

95
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,400
There are
no more Zoanoids.

96
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,000
Chronos is gone.
Can't you let it go?

97
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:46,800
What's the point
of holding on?

98
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,800
And you go over it and over it,
and you get crazier and crazier.

99
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,800
When do you
just say that...

100
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:01,000
This isn't gonna work,
is it?

101
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,600
Hey, thanks.

102
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:34,200
Excuse me, there's an archeological dig
going on near here.

103
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,800
Do you know
where it is?

104
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Customer waitin'.
You gonna buy something?

105
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,800
Uh, yeah.

106
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:44,600
- Well?
- $1.95.

107
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,400
Do you know how to reach them?
I have to get to that dig.

108
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:55,600
Don't know nothin'.
Ask down at the rangers.

109
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,400
What do you
want at the dig?

110
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,000
Excuse me?

111
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,800
I said, "what do you want
at the dig?"

112
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,200
- Do you work at the dig?
- Maybe.

113
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,200
- You have business there?
- I have to see it.

114
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,000
You with the press?

115
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,800
It's a private site,
you know.

116
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:22,200
No, no, I'm not a reporter.
I just need to...

117
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:24,800
Need to what?

118
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,000
Look...

119
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,800
I've been doing these
for months.

120
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,800
They're like the ones I saw on TV,
the ones from your cave.

121
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:38,000
See, I see it in my dreams
and I put it down on paper.

122
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,200
Yeah, I know
what it sounds like.

123
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,400
What?

124
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,600
You've seen this?

125
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
You've seen this.

126
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:04,200
I, uh...
I can't help you.

127
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,400
Thanks, Warren.

128
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,800
- Please take me there.
- Sorry, I don't think so.

129
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,800
Wait, I need to know.

130
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,600
I can't,
I'm sorry.

131
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Will you wait
a second?

132
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:25,000
Would you back away
from the truck, please?

133
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,200
Wait! I need to know!

134
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,200
Damn.

135
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:48,800
Get in.

136
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,200
I'm Cori Edwards.

137
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,600
I'm a researcher
up at the dig.

138
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:15,800
And you are...?

139
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:21,000
Sean Barker.

140
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,400
And...?

141
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,200
Look, I'm sorry,

142
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,000
I didn't mean to freak you
out back there.

143
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,000
It's just...

144
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
This is important to me.

145
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,600
Nice to meet you.

146
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:42,800
So, um...

147
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,200
Why'd you come back?

148
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,200
Because I'm a scientist.

149
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,400
I know what it's like
to need to know.

150
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,200
Thanks.

151
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,200
So, what do you
want to see?

152
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,400
Right.
Come on.

153
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,600
Just be cool
and follow my lead.

154
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,600
Hope I'm not getting
you in trouble.

155
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,600
Not if you do
what I say.

156
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,200
Mary,

157
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,200
take this to the commissary,
will ya?

158
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,000
And don't hog
it all to yourself.

159
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:07,200
- Morning, Miss Edwards.
- Morning, Grau. He's okay, he's with
me.

160
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,200
Watch your head.

161
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,000
Do all archeological
expeditions

162
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,400
have this
much security?

163
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,000
We didn't until your buddy
on TV broke in.

164
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,000
Cori!
Cori, over here.

165
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,200
Take a look at this!

166
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,400
Um, wait here.

167
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,400
I'll be right back.

168
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,000
You shouldn't wander
off like that.

169
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,600
You know, if anybody
asked about...

170
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,400
You know this means
as much to me as it does to you.

171
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,600
But they're telling me the operation
is costing too...

172
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,600
- Come on.
- If we don't hit pay dirt soon,

173
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,400
- they're gonna shut us down.
- "Pay dirt"?

174
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,400
I'm tired of them treating this
expedition
like an oil well.

175
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,800
I know, I know, but they're
management.

176
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:45,000
Arlen, you and I
had an agreement.

177
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
I find you your "pay dirt,"
but I run the show my way.

178
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,800
Hey, that's what I want.

179
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:52,400
And I'm gonna keep them off
as long as I can.

180
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:55,200
- Just do a good job, okay?
- I can't make miracles.

181
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:58,000
Yes, you can.
That's why you're here.

182
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,800
Dad?

183
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,800
Dad, I'd like you to meet Sean Barker
from State.

184
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,200
He was supposed to come up earlier,
but he had to finish up a project.

185
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:09,400
Sean, my father,
Marcus Edwards.

186
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,800
- Good to meet you son.
- Sir.

187
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,400
We can use the help.

188
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:15,400
Uh, this is Arlen Crane,
our Operations Director,

189
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:18,000
And Gus Volker,
our Security Chief.

190
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,600
Welcome aboard.

191
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:22,000
Nice to meet you.

192
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,400
Soon, Marcus, okay?

193
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,600
Administration.

194
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:33,600
Well, you go
get him set up.

195
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,600
I've gotta go
crack the whip.

196
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,600
Okay.
Thanks, dad.

197
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,600
Come on.

198
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:45,000
- I don't get it.
- This is where you want to be, right?

199
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
- Yeah, but...
- So be happy.

200
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,400
- Hey, Bob!
- Yeah?

201
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,200
- Come down here for a minute.
- Sure.

202
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,600
Okay, but we're playing
with my cards.

203
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,800
Bob, this is Sean.
Sean, Bob.

204
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:23,200
Show him the ropes, will ya?
I'll be back soon.

205
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,200
Sure.
Come on.

206
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,600
Lisker.

207
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,600
So, what exactly
are we digging up here?

208
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:54,000
Well, we think it's some variety
of pachycephalosaur.

209
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,800
Although it's kinda small
for that family.

210
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,400
See, once we carbon date it, then we'll
get
a real good idea what era it's from.

211
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,800
It's funny, once I was
on this dig in Arizona...

212
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,600
Wow, looks like
you really immersed yourself.

213
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,800
Yeah.

214
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:22,600
It's like I was digging up
parts of myself.

215
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:25,800
You're not some kind
of archeology groupie, are you, Sean?

216
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:34,800
Just that I...
can't figure you out.

217
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:38,400
I mean, why is coming here
so important to you?

218
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,000
Where did you see
those drawings?

219
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,000
I told you.

220
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:47,800
Oh yeah, right.

221
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:50,200
Sean, I brought you here
like you asked.

222
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,000
Don't you think I deserve
a real explanation?

223
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,600
A hint even?

224
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,000
Cori...

225
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,800
I want to...

226
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,800
but I can't.

227
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:09,600
I... I don't really know
what I'm looking for.

228
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,600
I know, I know,
that's no answer.

229
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:15,200
Yeah, your specialty,
I'm beginning to discover.

230
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,400
Well, listen, maybe we should just
call today a field trip

231
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,400
and tomorrow we'll
send you on your way.

232
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:25,000
No! I need to stay.

233
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:30,000
Look, I know I've got
no reason to be here.

234
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:33,000
You don't even know me.
But I need to stay.

235
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,600
Why?

236
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,800
Because I can't
be anywhere else.

237
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,800
I've got nowhere else to go.

238
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,000
I'm sorry.
That's just not good enough.

239
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:57,600
I thought you said you knew
what it was like to need to know.

240
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,200
I wonder.

241
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,000
Damn it.
Wait!

242
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:14,400
It was around here
that we saw him somewhere.

243
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,000
You think maybe we could do this
when there's a little more light?

244
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:23,200
You want this werewolf or not?

245
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,000
Look, you got about another
half hour, Mr. Kerlew.

246
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,200
After that,
I'm calling it quits.

247
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:34,000
Just hang on
to your checkbook.

248
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,600
Oh, Jesus Christ.

249
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,400
You think you're
the only one?

250
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,000
You think you're
the only one?

251
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,400
My dad and I are known
among the academic community

252
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:51,000
as "outlaws of science."

253
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,200
We're thinking
about getting jackets made up.

254
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,800
Outlaws? Why?

255
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:00,400
Oh, because of our
unconventional theories.

256
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,200
We take on
the wild stuff.

257
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:05,000
You know, the stuff that people laugh at
in the tabloids...

258
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,800
Bigfoot,
crop circles.

259
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,600
And the cave
paintings?

260
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:13,000
You have a theory
on them?

261
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:17,600
You know, I want
to tell you...

262
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,800
but I can't.

263
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,200
Touché.

264
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,600
What was that?

265
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,600
I don't know.
I heard someone shouting.

266
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:29,200
- Oh no, it could be another bear
attack.
- Shit.

267
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,200
You go and get help,
I'll take care of the bear.

268
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,400
Right.

269
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:38,000
He'll take care
of the bear?

270
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,400
Oh shit!

271
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Take a picture!
Take a picture!

272
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,600
Screw the picture,
you brain-dead hayseed! Shoot it!

273
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,200
What about my money?

274
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,200
- What about my money?
- Shoot it!

275
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,800
Shoot it!

276
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:13,000
- Hey! Help! Professor Atkins, help!
- Cori, what's wrong?!

277
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,600
I think there's another bear attack.
Somebody's in trouble.

278
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,600
- I'll get my gun. You go get the truck.
- Get the truck, right.

279
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:21,200
- Hurry, Sean's out there.
- What?

280
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,000
Guyver.

281
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,400
Don't you come near me,
you son of a bitch.

282
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:51,200
You shouldn't have come back.

283
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,600
It can't be.

284
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,600
Guyver?

285
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:06,800
Get away from him,
zoanoid.

286
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:12,000
Where did you come from?
I destroyed all of you.

287
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,600
What are you doing
in the camp?

288
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,800
Damn.

289
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,600
Over here.
This way.

290
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:50,200
- What happened? Where's the bear?
- I don't know.

291
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:53,400
I think the sound of your engine
drove it off.

292
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,800
- Oh my...
- Not soon enough.

293
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Look,
that one's alive.

294
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Oh! Whoa, man,
stay away from me.

295
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,400
Don't touch me.
You're one of them.

296
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:10,200
Shit. Look at him,
he's scared crazy.

297
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:14,200
Take it easy,
we're here to help you.

298
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,200
Are you all right?

299
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:20,200
- He's in shock. Get me a blanket.
- Yeah, right.

300
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,800
Make that two.

301
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,800
I'm just sorry
I didn't get here sooner.

302
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Thank God you didn't.
You could've been killed.

303
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,600
What'd you think you
were going to do?

304
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:36,600
I was wondering that myself.

305
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,200
All right, let's get him
in the truck.

306
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,600
I got you. I got you.

307
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:46,600
You two, wrap that one up
and put him in the back.

308
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,200
I'll keep us covered.

309
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:07,800
Okay, let's move out.

310
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,800
I've never seen
one this big before.

311
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:32,200
Who are you?

312
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,000
When did he appear?

313
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,800
He was on the scene
before anybody else.

314
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,400
Barker, Sean Barker.

315
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:17,000
Not at this time, but analysis
of the samples should...

316
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,600
I have to go.

317
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,200
What'd you hear?

318
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,600
What?
Nothing.

319
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:38,600
- I didn't hear anything.
- Then why'd you follow me?

320
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:39,800
I... I...

321
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:42,600
Let me guess...

322
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,400
Just curious, right?

323
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,000
I saw you leave camp
in a hurry.

324
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:48,400
I just figured you'd
seen the bear again.

325
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:51,000
Now, you and I both know
there wasn't any bear.

326
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:55,000
- We do?
- Spare me the dumb act.

327
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
I know you got claws
you ain't showing.

328
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,400
Claws?

329
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:02,000
I'm not the one
with the claws.

330
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:04,400
I don't know what
you people are up to,

331
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:06,600
but innocent people
are getting killed

332
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:08,600
and I can't allow
that to happen.

333
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,600
Wait, you're
with the government.

334
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:18,400
And you won't live long enough
to give me away.

335
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:23,400
What do you think
you were doing?

336
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:26,600
- Sorry, Mr. Crane.
- Tell the others we may have an
active...

337
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,200
What are you men
doing there?

338
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:40,400
Uh, we thought we saw
the bear again, Mr. Crane.

339
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,400
Well, for God's sakes then,
stay in camp.

340
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,600
We don't want anymore
corpses on our hands.

341
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:46,800
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

342
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:59,600
I gotta go.

343
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:00,800
Wait!

344
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,600
Who are you?

345
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:04,200
What are you doing here?

346
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,200
We don't need
this kind of attention.

347
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:16,600
If you can't keep a tighter rein
on your lieutenants...

348
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,800
I'm sorry, sir,
I'll correct my error.

349
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,800
But it did bring
something to light.

350
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,600
The Guyver.
He's here.

351
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,400
He must be someone
in the camp.

352
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:29,400
The hunted comes
to the hunter.

353
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:33,400
Find out who he is
and bring him here, quietly.

354
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:35,600
Don't worry, sir,
I can handle it.

355
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,000
- Morning, Bob.
- Yeah, good morning.

356
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:54,000
This wasn't here
yesterday.

357
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:05,400
Cori, you can tell me.
You like him?

358
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:09,400
- None of your business.
- I'm just excited for you, that's all.

359
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:13,400
I mean, it'd be nice to know
someone's finding a little romance.

360
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:17,200
All right. He's cute,
but nothing is happening.

361
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:19,800
- He's a little...
- Hi. Coffee?

362
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Did I miss something?

363
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,400
Uh, no, Sean,
have a seat.

364
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,000
That'll be all.

365
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,400
Check on you in a bit.

366
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,400
Take your time.

367
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:43,800
So, how goes the quest?

368
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,800
Well, I was
just wondering...

369
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,000
what kind of skeletons
are we digging up again?

370
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,200
Well, um,
we're not sure,

371
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,400
but we think it's a kind
of pachycephalosaur,

372
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:55,800
Although it's a little small
for that genus.

373
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:57,000
Once we carbon date it,

374
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,400
we'll know where
to place it, but right...

375
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,600
What?

376
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:09,200
You know, that's almost
word for word what Bob said.

377
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:12,800
What are you guys hiding?

378
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,800
They're not dinosaurs
at all, are they?

379
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:28,600
Look, everybody here knows
what we're digging for.

380
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:30,000
So why all the secrecy?

381
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,600
We can't just go spouting
crazy theories to the world

382
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:34,800
until we have the hard evidence
to back it up.

383
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:38,800
Dad and I have been putting this puzzle
together for five years.

384
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:42,800
I'm just praying it isn't another
"explainable mystery."

385
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,400
If we're wrong again...

386
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:47,000
So why don't you
stick to the safer stuff?

387
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:51,000
Why don't you go home?

388
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:56,400
I am not gonna let anybody
take this away from us.

389
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,200
Well?

390
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:17,600
It feels like leather.

391
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:18,800
It's soft.

392
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:21,400
Here, give me that.

393
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:28,400
That don't sound
like leather to me.

394
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:33,000
Hey, Dr. Edwards!
Dr. Edwards, over here.

395
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:38,600
What have you got,
my dear?

396
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:40,000
Listen.

397
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,200
This is wonderful.

398
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:51,600
Call my daughter,
inform Mr. Crane,

399
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:53,800
Get everyone in here
on the double.

400
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:57,600
I think we found it.

401
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:05,600
Dad, what's going on?

402
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:07,000
Corinne,

403
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:10,800
I think our five years of research
are about to pay off.

404
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:18,800
But when will we
know for sure?

405
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:20,800
Patience, Arlen.
We beat your deadline,

406
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:22,600
just give us the time
to do this right.

407
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:25,000
But there's been a complication.
Something's come up.

408
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,400
Arlen, please.

409
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:29,600
Gee, you don't suppose
this is one of those

410
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:31,000
"explainable mysteries,"
do you?

411
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:32,800
Just shut up
and dig.

412
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:37,400
Dr. Edwards, Dr. Edwards!

413
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:39,200
We took some readings
up the cliff.

414
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:42,800
It goes all the way to the top.
This thing is huge.

415
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:30,800
If these cave paintings
are accurate representations,

416
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:34,400
Then I speculate that it sinks down
another 40 meters

417
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:36,800
and curves east and west
for 20 meters

418
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:38,600
In each direction.

419
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,600
It's a ship.

420
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:32,800
- Bob, have you seen Sean?
- Not lately.

421
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:47,400
Hey, you okay?

422
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:52,800
I still can't believe it.

423
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:54,800
I know what you mean.

424
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:58,800
We came here
hoping to find anything...

425
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:03,600
anything that would suggest
an ancient alien visitation.

426
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:06,000
I mean, we would've
settled for alien beer cans.

427
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:10,600
Instead we got...

428
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:16,000
Five years
of getting laughed at,

429
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:18,600
our research ignored
by our colleagues.

430
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:23,000
Oh, the paper
I'm going to publish.

431
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:26,600
But the best part
is that now I have got

432
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:29,200
the greatest playground
a girl could ever wish for.

433
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,200
Look at this.

434
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:35,800
It's organic.
It was grown.

435
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,400
That sample I took is alive.
Alive, Sean.

436
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:41,600
This thing might've been
powered by photosynthesis.

437
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:43,200
Okay, that's all theory,

438
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:45,600
But with the funding from our sponsors,
we can find out.

439
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:48,400
We might even be able
to duplicate it.

440
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:52,000
Imagine being able
to grow a machine.

441
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:55,400
No more dirty factories.
No more pollution.

442
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:56,400
What?

443
00:47:56,600 --> 00:47:58,400
Nothing.

444
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:03,000
Now I see why
they call you an outlaw.

445
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
You haven't even
stepped inside

446
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,800
and already you're
saving the world.

447
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:10,000
What can I say?
I'm an optimist.

448
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:15,200
I wish I could see
the world like that.

449
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:25,200
We, um...
we're missing the party.

450
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:30,000
I'm not missing
anything.

451
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:36,000
Come on, let's go.

452
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:48,400
- Did you hear that?
- Hear what?

453
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
Nothing.

454
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:06,600
You wanna see something
really scary?

455
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:30,600
Hey, Cori, come here.

456
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:32,000
I'll be just a second.

457
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,600
Hey, what are you doing?

458
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:43,000
What do you know about
the Chronos Corporation?

459
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,200
- I don't know what you're talking
about.
- Come on.

460
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:48,000
You dated a Mizky Segawa
whose father worked for Chronos.

461
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,200
He was murdered shortly
before the LA branch was destroyed.

462
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:53,200
Do you know anything
about that?

463
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:55,400
Only what I read
in the papers.

464
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:58,400
Hey, less of that shit,
all right?

465
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:01,200
Let go of me.
I don't know anything.

466
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:04,400
You knew enough
to know the claws weren't yours.

467
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:10,800
- What?
- You said the claws weren't yours.

468
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:13,000
So whose are they?

469
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:17,200
That's what I thought.

470
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:20,200
Now, I want to know what you know
about Chronos and what they do.

471
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:27,400
Why? You said
Chronos was destroyed.

472
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:29,600
Chronos LA.

473
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,200
Chronos LA?

474
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:37,000
Jesus.

475
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:39,000
We know Chronos
is worldwide,

476
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,800
but we don't know
what those things are.

477
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,200
We found breeding tubes
and blood samples,

478
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:45,600
but never any bodies.

479
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:50,200
All right, look...

480
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:53,600
Chronos is
those things...

481
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:55,600
the whole organization.

482
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:58,400
They look human,
but they're not.

483
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:00,600
They change.

484
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:02,200
You're serious,
aren't you?

485
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:03,800
You saw that dead guy
last night.

486
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,800
The thing that killed him
is one of the guys in this camp.

487
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,400
- You saw this?
- Yeah.

488
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:10,800
Then why didn't it
kill you?

489
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:13,000
I...

490
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:20,600
- I'll tell you later.
- No, you tell me now.

491
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:22,200
Don't make me
have to arrest you.

492
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:26,800
Here?

493
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:30,800
Everything okay?

494
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:34,000
Oh, yeah it's fine.
Nice guy.

495
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:41,400
Kid, you gotta get
your priorities straight.

496
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:56,000
Well, I'm open
to suggestions.

497
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:58,200
Damn it!
We've come this far.

498
00:52:58,400 --> 00:52:59,800
Now what?

499
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:02,800
We can have a laser cutter
up here in two days.

500
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:05,200
- Three days tops.
- Three days?

501
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:07,200
Don't we have anything else
in the camp?

502
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:10,000
Sure, garden tools
and whisk brooms.

503
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,600
Lasers weren't the first thing
on the equipment list.

504
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:15,200
But we don't have time.

505
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:19,400
Well, what do you want me to say,
"open sesame"?

506
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:08,600
Amazing.

507
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,800
It's breathable, and the radiation
levels
are acceptable.

508
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:49,600
We can continue.
The rest of you may resume your work.

509
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:54,600
- Cori, it's beautiful.
- Oh.

510
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:24,400
No one is to touch anything
or enter any sealed room.

511
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:26,800
We're cataloging only today.

512
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:30,600
Take lots of pictures and try to map
the interior as you go.

513
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:34,000
If you have any trouble
breathing, get out.

514
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:36,800
We're not going to sacrifice anyone
in the name of science.

515
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:38,200
Got it?

516
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:41,200
Good.

517
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:44,400
Cori, you and Sean
go that way.

518
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:45,400
We'll go through here.

519
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:47,800
Let's go.

520
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:07,200
This way.
You have to see this.

521
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:21,600
Wow.

522
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:27,200
It's beautiful.

523
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:30,800
It's really humid
in here.

524
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:24,800
Can you hear me?

525
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:28,600
I'm here.

526
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,400
Talk to me, please.

527
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:53,400
Well?

528
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:07,600
My God,

529
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:10,800
how in the hell are we
going to get up there?

530
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
No stairs,
no visible access up.

531
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:17,800
I have a feeling that walking
was optional for these people.

532
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:20,400
We'll have to jury-rig
something, I suppose.

533
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:26,800
Get started.

534
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,800
I'm sure what we're
looking for is up there.

535
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:06,400
I'm here.

536
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:12,400
Well, you called me here.

537
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:14,600
Aren't you going
to say something?

538
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:23,000
Please, I'm trying,
but I don't understand.

539
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:30,400
Please.

540
00:59:37,600 --> 00:59:41,200
Why did you do this
to me?

541
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:45,000
What the hell am I?
What am I supposed to do with it?

542
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:50,800
You got the wrong guy.

543
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:55,400
I'm not cut out
for this.

544
00:59:57,800 --> 00:59:59,800
I can't live
like this anymore.

545
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,800
I'm not a killer.

546
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:14,000
I just want to be normal again.

547
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:27,400
I want my life back!

548
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:52,400
Dad, look at this.

549
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:54,400
It moved.

550
01:00:57,200 --> 01:01:00,200
Cori, I told you
not to touch anything.

551
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:02,200
What have you found?

552
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:03,800
Let me see that.

553
01:01:12,600 --> 01:01:14,400
No! Give it back!

554
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:16,000
Cori.

555
01:01:27,800 --> 01:01:31,800
We're the researchers.
It's our job to examine the new
artifacts.

556
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:35,000
- You don't have the right...
- As founders of this expedition,

557
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,600
we have whatever
rights we choose.

558
01:01:37,600 --> 01:01:39,400
If you don't like it,
you can go back to State

559
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:41,200
and teach freshman
archeology

560
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:43,200
while we're making history.

561
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:49,200
Dad, why don't you
stop him?

562
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:51,600
This is the most important
discovery we've ever made

563
01:01:51,600 --> 01:01:53,800
and you're letting him
take it away from us.

564
01:01:53,800 --> 01:01:56,000
We'll get
our chance, Cori.

565
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:59,600
Arlen is just taking it away
for safe keeping.

566
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:03,200
Safe keeping?
He's stealing it.

567
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:04,600
Cori, are you okay?

568
01:02:04,600 --> 01:02:06,800
Sean, he's taking
it away.

569
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:20,600
This is a breach
of contract, Crane.

570
01:02:20,800 --> 01:02:22,800
We'll sue you for this!

571
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
We were supposed
to have free rein, damn it!

572
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:29,000
No interference from the corporation.
Do you hear me?

573
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,800
- Forget it, Cori.
- Dad.

574
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:33,800
We'll get
our chance, Cori.

575
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,400
Just let it go.

576
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:39,000
- Cori...
- No! What is the matter with you all?

577
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:41,200
He took it away from us.

578
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:51,000
Mr. Crane...

579
01:02:53,800 --> 01:02:55,800
it's about the new kid.

580
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:58,200
Can I come in?

581
01:02:58,200 --> 01:02:59,800
Can I come in?

582
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,600
What do you want, Sean?

583
01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:06,600
I have to talk to you...
about Crane.

584
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:11,200
I don't want to talk about him
right now, okay?

585
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:14,400
Cori, there are things
you need to know.

586
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:27,200
I don't know how
to tell you this,

587
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:32,200
but you and your father
have been lied to.

588
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,800
You're working for a corporation
called Chronos,

589
01:03:37,800 --> 01:03:40,600
and Crane
is a part of them.

590
01:03:40,600 --> 01:03:43,000
They...

591
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,600
They're not good people.

592
01:03:45,800 --> 01:03:48,000
Where did you get all this?

593
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:51,000
I don't know any Chronos.

594
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:52,800
Our backers are
the Tempus Group.

595
01:03:52,800 --> 01:03:56,000
No, they're Chronos.
Trust me.

596
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:59,600
The thing you discovered
is very important to them.

597
01:03:59,600 --> 01:04:02,000
It's called
the Guyver unit.

598
01:04:02,200 --> 01:04:04,800
It's...
it's a powerful weapon.

599
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:07,400
Chronos has been
after it for years.

600
01:04:07,600 --> 01:04:11,000
All the people...

601
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:12,400
Shit.

602
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:15,800
All the people

603
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,400
who work for Chronos

604
01:04:18,600 --> 01:04:21,600
can change

605
01:04:21,600 --> 01:04:24,800
into monsters
called Zoanoids.

606
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:27,400
Volker is one for sure,
probably most of the others.

607
01:04:27,600 --> 01:04:30,000
The monsters
in the cave paintings

608
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:33,200
and the skeletons you've been
digging up, they're Zoanoids.

609
01:04:33,400 --> 01:04:35,200
The... the bears
that killed those people

610
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:36,400
are Zoanoids too.

611
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:39,400
They've lived alongside
us forever.

612
01:04:39,400 --> 01:04:42,800
All the stories you've ever heard about
werewolves or Bigfoot,

613
01:04:42,800 --> 01:04:44,800
they're all...

614
01:04:44,800 --> 01:04:47,400
Cori, I know,
but it's the truth.

615
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:49,800
- Listen.
- No, you listen...

616
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:51,600
I don't care who they are.

617
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:54,000
They put up the money
for this dig when no one else would.

618
01:04:54,200 --> 01:04:56,600
If they pull out,
the ship is gone.

619
01:04:56,800 --> 01:04:59,800
Oh, shit.
We've only just stepped inside.

620
01:04:59,800 --> 01:05:03,200
But is the ship more important
than your life?

621
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:05,600
You're dealing
with monsters here.

622
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:10,800
I trusted you, Sean.

623
01:05:10,800 --> 01:05:12,800
I trusted you
not to be crazy.

624
01:05:17,800 --> 01:05:18,600
Damn it!

625
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:21,400
Crane...

626
01:05:29,600 --> 01:05:32,800
The ship we excavated
is a gold mine, Mr. Gouo.

627
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:35,800
Now it's time to terminate
all non-Chronos personnel

628
01:05:35,800 --> 01:05:38,000
and bring in our own.

629
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:39,800
Terminate?

630
01:05:39,800 --> 01:05:42,400
What about Edwards' daughter
and the Guyver?

631
01:05:42,600 --> 01:05:45,000
Don't worry about her,
she's handled.

632
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:46,800
And the Guyver
is in our hands.

633
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:48,800
It will be on the way
to you in an hour.

634
01:05:48,800 --> 01:05:52,600
No promises, Crane,
just results.

635
01:05:57,600 --> 01:06:00,200
Mr. Crane...

636
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:03,800
I think we got a problem.

637
01:06:05,800 --> 01:06:09,000
Hey, Bob,
have you seen Cori?

638
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,600
You guys just can't seem
to connect, can you?

639
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:12,600
Tell me about it.

640
01:06:12,800 --> 01:06:15,200
Try the commissary,
it's lunch time.

641
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:17,400
Right, thanks.

642
01:06:54,200 --> 01:06:55,600
Excuse me.

643
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
It's calling you,
isn't it?

644
01:07:37,600 --> 01:07:39,400
What do you mean?

645
01:07:40,600 --> 01:07:42,800
It calls me too.

646
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:47,200
We're both its children.

647
01:07:50,200 --> 01:07:52,400
Sean, I know who you are.

648
01:07:53,800 --> 01:07:55,200
I know your pain.

649
01:07:55,200 --> 01:07:57,200
I'm like you.

650
01:07:58,600 --> 01:08:00,400
I don't know what
you're talking about.

651
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:04,000
We're the bastards

652
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:05,400
of an uncaring parent.

653
01:08:07,400 --> 01:08:08,800
We've been violated,

654
01:08:08,800 --> 01:08:11,800
our lives have been
changed against our will.

655
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:19,400
Sean, I know what
it's been like for you...

656
01:08:19,400 --> 01:08:22,200
for me.

657
01:08:22,400 --> 01:08:24,600
You've lost friends
and lovers, haven't you?

658
01:08:28,400 --> 01:08:29,800
So have I.

659
01:08:32,200 --> 01:08:35,200
We're forced
to lead secret lives.

660
01:08:40,200 --> 01:08:41,800
Trust me.

661
01:09:05,400 --> 01:09:07,400
I know,

662
01:09:07,400 --> 01:09:10,000
Look at me, I'm hideous.

663
01:09:10,200 --> 01:09:11,800
Do you think I want
to be this way?

664
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:13,600
A freak?

665
01:09:13,800 --> 01:09:17,400
That's why we're here...
to take back our lives.

666
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:19,600
Somewhere in this ship

667
01:09:19,800 --> 01:09:22,000
Is the key to changing
us back.

668
01:09:22,200 --> 01:09:24,800
Let's find it together.

669
01:09:24,800 --> 01:09:27,000
We can take the Guyver
out of you.

670
01:09:27,200 --> 01:09:30,800
We can make you
normal again.

671
01:09:30,800 --> 01:09:33,000
Isn't that what you want?

672
01:09:37,400 --> 01:09:38,600
I don't know.

673
01:09:40,400 --> 01:09:43,200
- You're killers.
- And so are you.

674
01:09:43,200 --> 01:09:46,600
No, it's the one
that kills, not me.

675
01:09:46,600 --> 01:09:51,400
Then let us help you.
We can make it stop.

676
01:09:54,200 --> 01:09:57,200
What do you say?
Friends?

677
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:06,200
I...

678
01:10:11,800 --> 01:10:12,600
No.

679
01:10:16,200 --> 01:10:17,800
Pity.

680
01:10:20,600 --> 01:10:23,600
Keep him sedated
until we return to base.

681
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:40,200
I love my job.

682
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:51,000
Comfy?

683
01:10:53,800 --> 01:10:55,000
Hey, bitch!

684
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,800
- What did we hit?
- I don't know.

685
01:10:59,800 --> 01:11:01,200
Well, step on it!

686
01:11:14,200 --> 01:11:15,600
Oh my God!

687
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:18,600
You, girl, get out.

688
01:11:23,400 --> 01:11:26,000
- Shit.
- Run!

689
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:38,600
You shouldn't have
interfered, Marcus.

690
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:43,400
Dad?

691
01:14:25,200 --> 01:14:27,600
Dad! Dad!

692
01:14:49,400 --> 01:14:52,400
Don't hurt him.
Leave him alone!

693
01:15:20,400 --> 01:15:22,600
Sleep tight, baby.

694
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:30,200
- Keep an eye on him.
- Yes, ma'am.

695
01:15:44,600 --> 01:15:46,200
Barker, Barker.

696
01:15:46,400 --> 01:15:47,800
- Atkins?
- You okay, kid?

697
01:15:47,800 --> 01:15:51,000
- What... yeah.
- Listen, I gotta get you outta here.

698
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:54,200
- The government wants you in one piece.
- What?

699
01:15:54,400 --> 01:15:55,600
My backup is on its way.

700
01:15:55,600 --> 01:15:57,800
This place is about
to become a battlefield.

701
01:15:57,800 --> 01:16:00,200
- Battlefield? Jesus. But the students...
- Shh.

702
01:16:00,200 --> 01:16:01,200
The students are fine.

703
01:16:01,400 --> 01:16:03,200
Now listen,
about this Guyver unit,

704
01:16:03,400 --> 01:16:05,400
what can it do?
Do they know how to use it?

705
01:16:05,400 --> 01:16:07,200
Cori, shit, I've got to get her
out of here.

706
01:16:07,400 --> 01:16:09,200
No, it's too late.
They've already taken her.

707
01:16:09,200 --> 01:16:11,200
- There was nothing I could do.
- Where? When?

708
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:14,000
About this Guyver unit...
they took the south road 15 minutes ago.

709
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,200
Now look, what about this Guyver unit?
How does it work?

710
01:16:16,200 --> 01:16:18,400
- I've got to go.
- You're not going anywhere. We need
you.

711
01:16:18,600 --> 01:16:22,600
- But she's in danger.
- I'm sorry, I can't let you go.

712
01:16:25,400 --> 01:16:27,800
Now look, this...

713
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:32,800
Aw, shit.

714
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:49,400
Shit.

715
01:18:06,200 --> 01:18:08,600
Co-ri!

716
01:18:13,800 --> 01:18:17,800
Cori!

717
01:18:19,400 --> 01:18:21,200
Sean?

718
01:18:21,400 --> 01:18:23,200
Sean! Help!

719
01:18:23,400 --> 01:18:25,400
Help us!

720
01:18:32,200 --> 01:18:33,600
Shit.

721
01:19:08,600 --> 01:19:10,400
Guyver!

722
01:20:20,600 --> 01:20:22,000
Take cover!

723
01:24:04,600 --> 01:24:05,800
Cori.

724
01:24:09,200 --> 01:24:10,600
No!

725
01:24:37,200 --> 01:24:38,400
Sean?

726
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:48,000
Wait!

727
01:25:08,400 --> 01:25:10,200
It's done, sir.

728
01:25:12,400 --> 01:25:14,000
But...

729
01:25:16,400 --> 01:25:18,200
the Guyver has escaped.

730
01:25:23,600 --> 01:25:25,000
He'll be back.

731
01:25:33,800 --> 01:25:35,400
Mr. Crane, help us.

732
01:25:35,600 --> 01:25:37,600
Mr. Crane,
what's going on?

733
01:25:37,800 --> 01:25:40,400
I'm sorry, your services
are no longer needed.

734
01:25:41,800 --> 01:25:43,800
Nothing personal.

735
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,400
Wait!
You can't do this.

736
01:25:49,200 --> 01:25:51,600
Hey, what is this?

737
01:25:55,200 --> 01:25:58,200
Hey, man, be cool.

738
01:25:58,200 --> 01:25:59,800
You don't have
to do this.

739
01:25:59,800 --> 01:26:01,000
Oh my God!

740
01:26:09,800 --> 01:26:13,000
Don't do anything...
funny.

741
01:26:17,400 --> 01:26:19,400
Thanks for saving
my life.

742
01:26:29,200 --> 01:26:31,200
I wanted to tell you,

743
01:26:31,400 --> 01:26:33,000
but how could I?
How do you tell somebody...

744
01:26:33,200 --> 01:26:35,400
What you told me
was hard enough.

745
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:39,600
It took a lot
of guts, Sean.

746
01:26:40,800 --> 01:26:42,400
Look...

747
01:26:43,600 --> 01:26:45,800
you don't have
to be nice to me, okay?

748
01:26:47,200 --> 01:26:49,600
You didn't know
what you were getting into.

749
01:26:51,800 --> 01:26:55,600
If you don't want to have
anything to do with me, I'll understand.

750
01:26:56,600 --> 01:26:59,000
It's not the first time.

751
01:27:11,200 --> 01:27:14,400
Hey, it's every
woman's dream

752
01:27:14,600 --> 01:27:17,200
to be rescued by
a knight in shining armor...

753
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:24,200
Even if he wears it on the inside.

754
01:27:45,800 --> 01:27:48,800
Look, I left your truck
at the top of the hill.

755
01:27:48,800 --> 01:27:50,800
Drive back to town,
find a place to hole up.

756
01:27:50,800 --> 01:27:52,200
I'll meet you
as soon as I can.

757
01:27:52,200 --> 01:27:56,000
- Wait, I'm coming with you.
- No, it's too dangerous.

758
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:59,000
Atkins is bringing in a strike force
to arrest Crane and his men.

759
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:00,600
Professor Atkins?

760
01:28:00,800 --> 01:28:02,800
Commander.
He's with the government.

761
01:28:02,800 --> 01:28:05,200
But he's gonna get slaughtered
if I don't get back there.

762
01:28:05,200 --> 01:28:08,400
I don't care.
I'm going with you.

763
01:28:08,400 --> 01:28:11,200
My father's back there.
I'm not leaving him.

764
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:14,200
Okay, come on.

765
01:28:15,400 --> 01:28:16,600
Move it, move it!

766
01:28:16,600 --> 01:28:19,400
Come on, people,
double time, let's go!

767
01:28:24,200 --> 01:28:25,400
Let's go!

768
01:28:56,200 --> 01:28:58,400
This is an outrage.
We're a reputable company.

769
01:28:58,400 --> 01:29:01,600
Reputable companies don't conduct
sick experiments on people.

770
01:29:01,600 --> 01:29:02,600
Where's your proof?

771
01:29:02,800 --> 01:29:04,800
A judge would laugh
this case out of court.

772
01:29:04,800 --> 01:29:06,400
Too bad it's not
going to court.

773
01:29:06,400 --> 01:29:08,200
Don't even try it,

774
01:29:08,200 --> 01:29:11,200
unless you think you're faster
than a speeding bullet.

775
01:29:16,400 --> 01:29:18,600
- Camp's secured, sir.
- Secure?

776
01:29:18,800 --> 01:29:21,000
- Where's the other one?
- Capped one in the cave.

777
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:23,600
- This is the only other.
- No, there's one more.

778
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:26,600
Where's Corben?

779
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:31,200
This is becoming interesting,
isn't it, captain?

780
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:38,200
Eagle 2, this is Eagle 1.
One hostile still at large.

781
01:29:38,400 --> 01:29:40,200
Code red status.
Shoot to kill.

782
01:29:40,400 --> 01:29:42,600
I repeat, shoot to kill.

783
01:29:42,600 --> 01:29:45,600
Read you, Lima Charlie,
Eagle 1.

784
01:29:50,200 --> 01:29:51,600
We'll find him
soon enough.

785
01:30:02,800 --> 01:30:04,600
Or he'll find you.

786
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,000
Mason, Lewis,
intercept the enemy.

787
01:30:08,200 --> 01:30:09,200
Yes, sir!

788
01:30:11,200 --> 01:30:14,400
More lambs to the slaughter?

789
01:30:26,200 --> 01:30:28,200
- Looks like he did it.
- No.

790
01:30:28,400 --> 01:30:31,200
Something's wrong.
Where's his backup?

791
01:30:33,200 --> 01:30:35,200
Come on,
we don't have much time.

792
01:30:37,200 --> 01:30:38,200
Wait!

793
01:30:39,800 --> 01:30:41,600
Would you wait?

794
01:30:41,600 --> 01:30:43,000
What is it?

795
01:30:43,200 --> 01:30:45,000
We have to destroy
the ship.

796
01:30:46,200 --> 01:30:49,000
Destroy the ship?
Why?

797
01:30:49,200 --> 01:30:51,400
Atkins is out there,
everything's under control.

798
01:30:51,400 --> 01:30:53,000
I'm not so sure about that.

799
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:54,800
Besides,
it doesn't matter who wins.

800
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:57,600
I doubt the government
is any more responsible than Chronos.

801
01:30:57,600 --> 01:31:01,200
No, we can't.
All that knowledge.

802
01:31:01,200 --> 01:31:04,600
- I'll never get a chance to do the
research...
- Neither will I.

803
01:31:04,800 --> 01:31:06,600
But if we don't
destroy it,

804
01:31:06,600 --> 01:31:09,000
too many people will die
fighting for it.

805
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:23,800
They want
the weapons, Cori.

806
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,000
That's all
they'll ever want.

807
01:31:46,800 --> 01:31:48,800
You know, that's only
gonna piss him off.

808
01:32:00,800 --> 01:32:03,200
Now that we've wasted
enough time...

809
01:32:07,200 --> 01:32:09,200
I have to take this.

810
01:32:11,200 --> 01:32:13,600
Your hour is up.
Where is the Guyver?

811
01:32:13,600 --> 01:32:16,800
There's been some delays.
The Guyver...

812
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:19,200
- Crane...
- We'll get him back sir.

813
01:32:19,200 --> 01:32:22,800
He's fixated on the ship.
He won't leave.

814
01:32:22,800 --> 01:32:25,600
Have him here
in an another hour.

815
01:32:25,600 --> 01:32:28,800
Or shall I send someone
with more experience?

816
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:32,400
No. No, I can handle it.
I'll take care of it.

817
01:32:32,400 --> 01:32:34,200
One more hour, Crane.

818
01:32:35,600 --> 01:32:37,400
If we lose him...

819
01:32:37,400 --> 01:32:41,000
One hour, sir.
Yes, sir.

820
01:32:44,200 --> 01:32:45,200
Shit!

821
01:33:26,800 --> 01:33:30,800
What gets me is that I've spent
my whole life working toward this,

822
01:33:30,800 --> 01:33:34,000
always scared that I was chasing
some pipe dream.

823
01:33:36,600 --> 01:33:38,600
And the minute
I find out it's true...

824
01:33:42,600 --> 01:33:44,400
I have to destroy it.

825
01:33:56,800 --> 01:33:59,000
What's wrong?

826
01:34:08,600 --> 01:34:10,600
Don't fight it.

827
01:34:10,800 --> 01:34:12,400
Go.

828
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:32,800
Keep setting the charges.

829
01:34:45,800 --> 01:34:48,200
Why do you keep calling me?

830
01:34:48,400 --> 01:34:49,800
Am I not the one
you want?

831
01:35:08,800 --> 01:35:10,800
I'm not the one, am I?

832
01:35:21,200 --> 01:35:22,200
Guyver.

833
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:12,800
The Guyver
will be back soon.

834
01:38:12,800 --> 01:38:15,400
Let's prepare him
a nice welcome.

835
01:38:15,400 --> 01:38:16,600
What about him?

836
01:38:19,600 --> 01:38:24,000
Bring him. Let's show him
some real soldiers in action.

837
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:35,600
Come on, Sean,
where are you?

838
01:38:42,200 --> 01:38:43,800
Take her!

839
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:57,400
Sean!
Sean, help.

840
01:39:09,400 --> 01:39:11,800
An archeologist
destroying the past?

841
01:39:11,800 --> 01:39:16,000
Not accepted scientific behavior,
Miss Edwards.

842
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,600
It's better than handing it
over to you.

843
01:39:21,400 --> 01:39:23,600
The Guyver must be in the ship.
Find him.

844
01:39:54,200 --> 01:39:55,600
Let her go, Crane.

845
01:39:56,800 --> 01:39:59,600
Impressive,
but pointless.

846
01:39:59,600 --> 01:40:03,200
- Are you okay, Cori?
- Yeah.

847
01:40:03,200 --> 01:40:05,000
Sean, don't be a hero.

848
01:40:05,200 --> 01:40:08,400
Deactivate the Guyver
and surrender

849
01:40:08,600 --> 01:40:10,800
or I'll kill her.

850
01:40:10,800 --> 01:40:13,400
Don't listen to him, Sean.

851
01:40:15,600 --> 01:40:17,400
Time's a' wastin'.

852
01:40:17,400 --> 01:40:19,200
Crane!

853
01:40:20,600 --> 01:40:21,600
Stop!

854
01:40:24,600 --> 01:40:28,600
- Crane, we had a deal.
- Dad, help.

855
01:40:28,600 --> 01:40:32,400
Arlen, please,
we had a deal.

856
01:40:32,600 --> 01:40:34,800
Yes, we pay
for your research

857
01:40:34,800 --> 01:40:36,800
and you give us
the weapons.

858
01:40:36,800 --> 01:40:38,800
You should've told
your daughter, Marcus.

859
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:41,200
It would've saved us
a lot of trouble.

860
01:40:41,200 --> 01:40:44,200
Dad, how could you bargain
with this murderer?

861
01:40:44,200 --> 01:40:48,000
Don't you get it, Cori?
Your dad's a company man.

862
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,800
Stand aside, Marcus!

863
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:54,600
Now, one last time,

864
01:40:54,600 --> 01:40:57,200
retract the armor...

865
01:41:01,400 --> 01:41:03,000
or I'll tear her apart.

866
01:41:12,800 --> 01:41:15,800
No! You will not
hurt my daughter.

867
01:41:26,200 --> 01:41:27,200
Marcus!

868
01:41:30,200 --> 01:41:31,600
You're fired.

869
01:41:51,200 --> 01:41:52,200
Atkins, catch!

870
01:41:54,200 --> 01:41:56,000
Protect her.

871
01:41:58,400 --> 01:42:00,000
Who the hell's
gonna protect me?

872
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:09,400
Give me the case.

873
01:42:09,400 --> 01:42:11,000
- The case.
- Yeah...

874
01:42:11,200 --> 01:42:13,400
Just give it to me!

875
01:42:13,400 --> 01:42:14,800
Okay, bitch,
come and get it.

876
01:42:24,400 --> 01:42:27,000
That's mine!

877
01:43:12,200 --> 01:43:13,400
Dad!

878
01:43:42,200 --> 01:43:43,400
Hey, hey.

879
01:45:58,400 --> 01:45:59,800
Bitch.

880
01:46:23,200 --> 01:46:24,200
Do it.

881
01:46:32,200 --> 01:46:34,400
It didn't have to be
this way, Marcus.

882
01:46:34,400 --> 01:46:36,800
We were doing great
things together.

883
01:46:36,800 --> 01:46:38,800
You could've been
somebody in the company.

884
01:46:38,800 --> 01:46:42,000
Junior vice president
in charge of genocide?

885
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:43,400
I'd rather die.

886
01:46:49,400 --> 01:46:51,600
Then so be it!

887
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:02,200
No!

888
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:40,800
Leave him alone.

889
01:47:42,200 --> 01:47:43,400
Back off.

890
01:47:45,400 --> 01:47:46,600
How's he doing?

891
01:47:46,600 --> 01:47:49,600
I don't know.
It's bad.

892
01:47:51,400 --> 01:47:54,200
Why are you attacking
your own kind, freak?

893
01:47:54,400 --> 01:47:55,400
We could've helped you.

894
01:47:55,600 --> 01:47:58,000
I'm no freak
and I'm not like you.

895
01:47:58,200 --> 01:48:00,800
You threaten mankind.
I protect them.

896
01:48:02,400 --> 01:48:04,000
Barker!

897
01:48:18,200 --> 01:48:21,000
- You didn't.
- So tell me,

898
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:23,400
who's going
to protect the protector?

899
01:48:24,600 --> 01:48:25,800
Bio-morph.

900
01:48:41,400 --> 01:48:43,200
Oh my God.

901
01:48:44,200 --> 01:48:47,600
A Guyver zoanoid.

902
01:48:47,600 --> 01:48:49,400
The next step.

903
01:48:49,600 --> 01:48:51,200
You don't know
what you're doing, Crane.

904
01:48:51,400 --> 01:48:53,400
That unit's damaged.

905
01:48:53,600 --> 01:48:55,600
You have no idea what
it'll do to you.

906
01:48:55,600 --> 01:48:58,200
But it'll do you
just fine.

907
01:50:18,400 --> 01:50:21,200
You can't win, Crane.
The ship told me the truth.

908
01:50:21,200 --> 01:50:23,200
You're an experiment
gone out of control.

909
01:50:23,200 --> 01:50:25,200
No, I'm
in complete control.

910
01:50:25,200 --> 01:50:28,200
The aliens created the Guyver
to fix their mistakes.

911
01:50:28,200 --> 01:50:30,800
You're the mistake.
I'm the final product.

912
01:52:41,400 --> 01:52:44,000
With this alien power,

913
01:52:44,200 --> 01:52:46,400
Chronos will be triumphant

914
01:52:46,600 --> 01:52:48,600
and man shall know
his true destiny...

915
01:52:48,600 --> 01:52:51,400
To serve our kind!

916
01:52:51,600 --> 01:52:53,800
Not if I can help it.
You're cracked, Crane.

917
01:52:53,800 --> 01:52:55,600
You're gonna self-destruct.

918
01:52:55,600 --> 01:52:58,000
Never.
The unit feeds me.

919
01:52:58,200 --> 01:53:01,000
I feel the power
growing stronger.

920
01:53:13,600 --> 01:53:16,200
How does it feel
to be obsolete,

921
01:53:16,400 --> 01:53:18,400
outclassed
by a new model?

922
01:53:18,400 --> 01:53:19,600
Crane!

923
01:53:39,800 --> 01:53:43,600
Sorry, Crane, this model
has been recalled.

924
01:54:05,600 --> 01:54:08,400
No!
No, help me!

925
01:55:18,600 --> 01:55:20,400
Out of control.

926
01:55:24,600 --> 01:55:25,800
Sean!

927
01:55:32,800 --> 01:55:34,600
Sean, we did it.

928
01:55:37,600 --> 01:55:38,600
We did it.

929
01:55:45,800 --> 01:55:49,200
So it looks like
you found your destiny.

930
01:55:50,600 --> 01:55:52,000
Cori, I lied.

931
01:55:52,200 --> 01:55:54,400
The Zoanoids weren't
the failed experiment...

932
01:55:54,400 --> 01:55:56,200
the Guyvers were.

933
01:55:56,400 --> 01:55:58,200
The aliens turned
humans into Guyvers

934
01:55:58,200 --> 01:56:00,400
so we could fight
their wars for them.

935
01:56:00,400 --> 01:56:04,000
But humans rebelled...
out of control.

936
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:06,600
Guyver is nothing
more than a weapon.

937
01:56:08,800 --> 01:56:10,800
I have no destiny.

938
01:56:14,600 --> 01:56:16,600
You made your own.

939
01:56:19,400 --> 01:56:21,400
You're a hell
of a weapon, kid.

940
01:56:21,400 --> 01:56:24,000
It's a good thing
you're on our side.

941
01:56:25,400 --> 01:56:27,200
I'm not a religious man...

942
01:56:28,600 --> 01:56:32,000
but you may have
just prevented Armageddon.

943
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:34,200
Who knows how many
more weapons are on board?

944
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:38,400
Well, now at least they'll
be safe with the government,

945
01:56:38,400 --> 01:56:41,600
- where they belong.
- No.

946
01:56:41,600 --> 01:56:43,800
That's not where
it belongs.

947
01:56:59,200 --> 01:57:00,400
What are you doing?

948
01:57:14,800 --> 01:57:17,400
- Sean?
- Stand back, Cori.

949
01:57:17,400 --> 01:57:19,400
What are you doing,
Goddamn it?

950
01:57:19,400 --> 01:57:21,200
I'm sending it home.

951
01:57:21,200 --> 01:57:23,200
What?
You can't do that.

952
01:57:23,200 --> 01:57:26,000
That's government property.
Stop it!

953
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:28,200
You're jeopardizing
our national security.

954
01:57:28,200 --> 01:57:30,600
No, I'm saving it.

955
01:57:45,200 --> 01:57:47,200
It's not safe.
Let's go.

956
01:59:47,800 --> 01:59:49,200
Barker?

957
01:59:49,200 --> 01:59:51,600
- This is not the time.
- Barker, we have to talk.

958
01:59:51,600 --> 01:59:53,000
There's nothing
more to say.

959
01:59:53,000 --> 01:59:54,600
I already
told you everything.

960
01:59:54,800 --> 01:59:57,800
Wait! We're launching an underground war
against Chronos.

961
01:59:58,000 --> 02:00:00,800
The government
could use your help.

962
02:00:02,600 --> 02:00:04,600
See you around,
Atkins.

963
02:00:09,400 --> 02:00:11,800
At least tell me
how I can reach you!

964
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:22,200
See you around, kid.
