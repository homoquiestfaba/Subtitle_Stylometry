1
00:00:05,406 --> 00:00:06,640
(whooshing)

2
00:00:15,716 --> 00:00:18,619
(light, enigmatic music)

3
00:00:37,505 --> 00:00:39,140
(car rumbling)

4
00:01:24,652 --> 00:01:26,320
(thudding)

5
00:01:33,794 --> 00:01:35,429
What do you think?

6
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,708
You must be Richard.

7
00:01:47,741 --> 00:01:49,143
I'm Luke.

8
00:01:49,177 --> 00:01:50,411
This is my wife Jennifer,
sorry we kept you.

9
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:52,546
Three bedrooms,
one and a half baths

10
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:54,382
She's old,

11
00:01:54,415 --> 00:01:56,250
but she's got good bones.

12
00:01:59,287 --> 00:02:00,521
When was it built?

13
00:02:00,554 --> 00:02:02,723
Come one inside and
take a look around.

14
00:02:02,756 --> 00:02:05,125
You let me know if you find
any problems or whatnot.

15
00:02:23,611 --> 00:02:24,745
Good bones, huh?

16
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:28,249
Comes with the furniture?

17
00:02:28,949 --> 00:02:30,451
Yeah.

18
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:32,953
I guess, Richard got
the house on auction.

19
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:34,555
Hmm.

20
00:02:34,588 --> 00:02:35,756
[Luke] He's been
meaning to fix it up a bit

21
00:02:35,789 --> 00:02:39,593
but hasn't gotten
around to it yet, so.

22
00:02:39,627 --> 00:02:40,894
He did like this.

23
00:02:44,798 --> 00:02:46,900
He's giving us a
really nice deal.

24
00:02:48,836 --> 00:02:50,238
Great.

25
00:02:54,542 --> 00:02:55,909
Hey.

26
00:02:56,977 --> 00:02:59,313
Give it a chance, huh?

27
00:02:59,347 --> 00:03:01,549
I think this could be fun.

28
00:03:01,582 --> 00:03:02,916
Playing house for a few months.

29
00:03:10,858 --> 00:03:13,193
I'll go get rid of,
Mr. Personality.

30
00:03:21,602 --> 00:03:23,203
A few months.

31
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:32,980
(click)

32
00:04:41,349 --> 00:04:44,485
I haven't lived in a
house since I left.

33
00:04:44,518 --> 00:04:46,454
And our apartment,

34
00:04:46,487 --> 00:04:48,622
I think it'd fit in
within these two rooms.

35
00:04:50,491 --> 00:04:51,925
It's a lot of house.

36
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,628
It's a lot to get used to.

37
00:04:57,365 --> 00:04:58,932
It's only for now.

38
00:05:00,534 --> 00:05:02,970
And I think this is gonna
be really good for us.

39
00:05:05,573 --> 00:05:07,475
And once things
have settled down,

40
00:05:09,076 --> 00:05:10,844
Chicago will still be there.

41
00:05:12,045 --> 00:05:13,947
Promise?

42
00:05:13,981 --> 00:05:15,416
Promise.

43
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:21,021
It's a nice house.

44
00:05:28,962 --> 00:05:31,365
(gasping, rustling)

45
00:05:34,502 --> 00:05:36,103
(knocking)

46
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:50,050
(click)

47
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:51,018
Hello.

48
00:05:51,051 --> 00:05:51,785
[Luke] Meredith?

49
00:05:51,819 --> 00:05:53,053
Mom.

50
00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:54,988
Oh, well you just
look at this house.

51
00:05:55,022 --> 00:05:57,891
It is so good to
have you back, Jenny.

52
00:05:57,925 --> 00:06:00,127
You have no idea how
much I've missed you.

53
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,962
And you, Luke.

54
00:06:01,995 --> 00:06:03,130
Handsome as ever.

55
00:06:03,163 --> 00:06:05,866
Oh, welcome home, welcome.

56
00:06:05,899 --> 00:06:09,570
Oh, and I've brought you a
little house warming gift

57
00:06:09,603 --> 00:06:10,804
for the nursery.

58
00:06:10,838 --> 00:06:12,873
And, some wraps from
over at Larry's Place.

59
00:06:12,906 --> 00:06:13,941
I figured you must be starving.

60
00:06:13,974 --> 00:06:15,709
We just ordered a pizza.

61
00:06:15,743 --> 00:06:16,910
So.

62
00:06:16,944 --> 00:06:18,646
Well, how was I
suppose to know that?

63
00:06:18,679 --> 00:06:20,113
Could've called,
that would've worked.

64
00:06:20,147 --> 00:06:21,715
Honey, it's okay, I'll
just put them in the fridge.

65
00:06:21,749 --> 00:06:23,016
Meredith, thank you,
it was very thoughtful.

66
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:24,818
Well I figured you
must be starving.

67
00:06:24,852 --> 00:06:26,153
No, really we are, here.

68
00:06:26,186 --> 00:06:26,954
Come in.

69
00:06:26,987 --> 00:06:28,422
Excuse me, dear.

70
00:06:28,456 --> 00:06:29,857
Oh.

71
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:33,627
(chuckling)

72
00:06:33,661 --> 00:06:35,529
I see you just
started to unpack.

73
00:06:35,563 --> 00:06:37,431
We got here this afternoon.

74
00:06:37,465 --> 00:06:40,067
I know, I know, just saying.

75
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:42,470
You have an awfully long
way to go, don't you?

76
00:06:42,503 --> 00:06:43,804
Yes.

77
00:06:45,172 --> 00:06:46,674
It's not so bad.

78
00:06:46,707 --> 00:06:48,175
I was telling Jennifer
earlier, how exciting.

79
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:51,111
Yes, it's terribly,
terribly exciting.

80
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:52,946
Well.

81
00:06:54,047 --> 00:06:55,716
Certainly is big enough.

82
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:02,490
I'm gonna go put
these in the kitchen.

83
00:07:02,523 --> 00:07:04,124
Meredith, maybe you wanna
take a look around upstairs?

84
00:07:04,157 --> 00:07:05,225
Sounds lovely.

85
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:07,160
Yes.

86
00:07:07,194 --> 00:07:09,129
Jenny, coming?

87
00:07:20,173 --> 00:07:23,210
Luke seems to be in high
spirits, doesn't he?

88
00:07:28,716 --> 00:07:30,250
And you?

89
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:32,085
How are you?

90
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:33,821
You don't have to
tiptoe around me, Mom.

91
00:07:33,854 --> 00:07:34,755
I'm fine.

92
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:35,756
Please don't lie, Jenny.

93
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:37,491
It doesn't suit you.

94
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:40,193
What do you want?

95
00:07:40,227 --> 00:07:42,195
I want you to be happy.

96
00:07:42,229 --> 00:07:44,197
I'm happy, things are great.

97
00:07:44,231 --> 00:07:46,033
I'm glad to hear that.

98
00:07:46,066 --> 00:07:48,068
After all the help
I've given you.

99
00:07:48,101 --> 00:07:49,537
I don't need your help.

100
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:50,203
(laughing)

101
00:07:50,237 --> 00:07:51,905
I beg to differ.

102
00:07:51,939 --> 00:07:52,973
Where would you be

103
00:07:53,006 --> 00:07:55,142
if I hadn't convinced
Richard about this house?

104
00:07:55,175 --> 00:07:57,110
And help Luke get this job?

105
00:07:57,144 --> 00:07:58,178
In Chicago.

106
00:07:58,211 --> 00:08:00,147
Oh yes.

107
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:03,917
Raising a family on a
bartender salary alone.

108
00:08:03,951 --> 00:08:05,252
Of course.

109
00:08:05,285 --> 00:08:06,720
No.

110
00:08:06,754 --> 00:08:09,089
I think this is going to
be best for both of you.

111
00:08:09,122 --> 00:08:10,958
The three of you.

112
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:14,261
Besides, it's about time Luke
did something with his degree.

113
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:17,731
And you?

114
00:08:17,765 --> 00:08:18,666
Can we not do this right now?

115
00:08:18,699 --> 00:08:19,600
Still haven't talked about it.

116
00:08:19,633 --> 00:08:20,834
There's nothing to talk about.

117
00:08:20,868 --> 00:08:22,169
Your irrational
little episode.

118
00:08:22,202 --> 00:08:23,571
Stop, Mom.

119
00:08:23,604 --> 00:08:24,772
You know, I wasn't
exactly thrilled

120
00:08:24,805 --> 00:08:27,140
when I found out I
was pregnant with you.

121
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:29,677
But I managed to keep
it together, didn't I?

122
00:08:30,644 --> 00:08:32,045
You should leave.

123
00:08:32,079 --> 00:08:34,014
I didn't act like
a spoiled child.

124
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:35,816
What you did was irresponsible.

125
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:37,017
Embarrassing, really.

126
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:38,285
Get out.

127
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:46,660
Of course.

128
00:08:46,694 --> 00:08:48,228
It's none of my business.

129
00:08:55,803 --> 00:08:58,105
I'm just so glad
everything's alright.

130
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:04,878
It's a lovely house.

131
00:09:15,222 --> 00:09:16,189
Leaving already?

132
00:09:16,223 --> 00:09:17,224
I should be going.

133
00:09:17,257 --> 00:09:19,159
Let you two finish unpacking.

134
00:09:19,192 --> 00:09:20,894
Goodnight, Luke.

135
00:09:20,928 --> 00:09:22,195
Thanks for the wraps.

136
00:09:22,229 --> 00:09:23,897
It was nice to see you.

137
00:09:25,198 --> 00:09:26,166
Jenny.

138
00:09:26,199 --> 00:09:27,701
Bye Mom.

139
00:09:27,735 --> 00:09:29,903
Oh, I forgot to tell you.

140
00:09:29,937 --> 00:09:31,939
I'm going to be throwing
a house warming party

141
00:09:31,972 --> 00:09:33,273
for you here this weekend.

142
00:09:33,306 --> 00:09:35,643
I've invited all of
my friends, of course

143
00:09:35,676 --> 00:09:36,777
and some of yours.

144
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:37,978
What?

145
00:09:38,011 --> 00:09:39,046
I'm going to make
a few appetizers

146
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:40,313
and dips and the like.

147
00:09:40,347 --> 00:09:42,282
But you should probably put a
few things together yourself.

148
00:09:42,315 --> 00:09:43,717
We can't have a party.

149
00:09:43,751 --> 00:09:44,852
Oh and

150
00:09:44,885 --> 00:09:47,755
make sure you've
finished unpacking, hmm?

151
00:09:47,788 --> 00:09:50,023
I don't want anyone to get
a bad first impression.

152
00:09:53,126 --> 00:09:54,327
(thud)

153
00:09:55,963 --> 00:09:57,130
[Voiceover] She
made you curtains?

154
00:09:57,164 --> 00:09:58,331
Yes.

155
00:09:58,365 --> 00:10:00,400
[Voiceover] Oh
god, what a delight.

156
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:02,335
With elephants
and zebras on them.

157
00:10:03,704 --> 00:10:04,838
[Voiceover] She made
you jungle curtains.

158
00:10:04,872 --> 00:10:06,674
She made me jungle curtains.

159
00:10:06,707 --> 00:10:08,842
[Voiceover] Oh
I just, I can't.

160
00:10:08,876 --> 00:10:09,977
You have to put them up.

161
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:10,778
(laughing)

162
00:10:10,811 --> 00:10:12,279
Absolutely not.

163
00:10:12,312 --> 00:10:14,147
[Voiceover] Oh come
one, you're being no fun.

164
00:10:14,181 --> 00:10:16,083
No, I already
explained to Luke.

165
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:18,185
Putting them up would
seem too permanent.

166
00:10:18,218 --> 00:10:20,253
Next thing you know we're
painting the walls to match

167
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:21,689
and getting new carpet

168
00:10:21,722 --> 00:10:22,923
and putting the
pool in the back.

169
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:24,858
We're not gonna
be here that long.

170
00:10:24,892 --> 00:10:26,259
[Voiceover] Ready to
come back already, huh?

171
00:10:26,293 --> 00:10:27,127
(sighing)

172
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,295
Oh yes.

173
00:10:28,328 --> 00:10:30,764
[Voiceover] You're not
enjoying it even a little bit?

174
00:10:30,798 --> 00:10:32,332
My life's in Chicago, Lauren.

175
00:10:32,365 --> 00:10:33,233
(thump)

176
00:10:33,266 --> 00:10:34,434
You're in Chicago.

177
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:36,169
There's nothing for me here.

178
00:10:36,203 --> 00:10:38,271
[Voiceover] Yeah, I
know I want you back too.

179
00:10:39,707 --> 00:10:42,209
Just stay positive,
it'll be over soon.

180
00:10:42,242 --> 00:10:44,377
It's only gonna be
what you make of it.

181
00:10:44,411 --> 00:10:46,346
Yeah, yeah, I know.

182
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:49,683
Honey, what are these?

183
00:10:49,717 --> 00:10:52,052
Oh yeah, turns
out we have rats.

184
00:10:52,085 --> 00:10:53,086
Hold on.

185
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,154
We have rats?

186
00:10:54,187 --> 00:10:54,988
Yeah.

187
00:10:55,022 --> 00:10:56,189
Down in the crawlspace,

188
00:10:56,223 --> 00:10:57,891
I saw some droppings
this morning.

189
00:10:57,925 --> 00:10:59,326
He says we have rats
in the crawlspace.

190
00:10:59,359 --> 00:11:00,894
[Voiceover] Rats
in the crawlspace?

191
00:11:00,928 --> 00:11:02,295
God, that's awful.

192
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:04,031
At least he didn't
find any dead bodies.

193
00:11:04,064 --> 00:11:05,232
That would be a deal breaker.

194
00:11:05,265 --> 00:11:06,867
Oh yeah, I forgot to mention.

195
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:07,835
Shut up.

196
00:11:07,868 --> 00:11:09,102
I better go, sorry.

197
00:11:09,136 --> 00:11:10,838
[Voiceover] No, I get it.

198
00:11:10,871 --> 00:11:12,940
I've a problem
with my own anyway.

199
00:11:12,973 --> 00:11:14,307
Brad's been drawing
on the walls lately

200
00:11:14,341 --> 00:11:17,344
and he just ran by with
a handful of markers.

201
00:11:17,377 --> 00:11:19,279
I'm afraid he's
feeling artistic again.

202
00:11:19,312 --> 00:11:20,247
(laughing)

203
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,181
You think rats are bad?

204
00:11:21,214 --> 00:11:22,249
Try dealing with a toddler.

205
00:11:22,282 --> 00:11:24,117
Something to look forward to.

206
00:11:25,352 --> 00:11:26,787
Come visit me?

207
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,188
[Voiceover] Done.

208
00:11:28,221 --> 00:11:29,322
Miss you, love you.

209
00:11:29,356 --> 00:11:30,824
Miss you, love you.

210
00:11:30,858 --> 00:11:31,725
[Voiceover] Brad,
I swear you put the.

211
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:32,893
(beep)

212
00:11:38,365 --> 00:11:40,133
(clink)

213
00:11:44,471 --> 00:11:47,174
(light, enigmatic music)

214
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,829
I'm gonna go to my Mom's.

215
00:12:08,862 --> 00:12:10,363
Get those things for tonight.

216
00:12:10,397 --> 00:12:11,164
She's out getting her hair done

217
00:12:11,198 --> 00:12:13,266
so I figured now's
the best time.

218
00:12:14,434 --> 00:12:15,869
You want me to go?

219
00:12:15,903 --> 00:12:18,872
No, I want to
get out the house.

220
00:12:18,906 --> 00:12:20,273
Cabin fever, huh?

221
00:12:20,307 --> 00:12:22,209
I'm just starting
to feel a bit trapped.

222
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:24,878
In less than a week and she's
already running our lives.

223
00:12:24,912 --> 00:12:26,880
Come on, it's not that bad.

224
00:12:26,914 --> 00:12:28,381
She is throwing us a party.

225
00:12:28,415 --> 00:12:30,217
She's throwing
herself a party.

226
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,484
I really don't think she's.

227
00:12:31,518 --> 00:12:32,986
This isn't about us
Luke, it's about her.

228
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:34,521
It's always about her.

229
00:12:34,554 --> 00:12:36,489
Jennifer.

230
00:12:36,523 --> 00:12:38,158
Come here.

231
00:12:39,026 --> 00:12:40,427
Come here.

232
00:12:42,362 --> 00:12:44,264
I'm sorry.

233
00:12:44,297 --> 00:12:45,765
I'm overreacting.

234
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:50,403
Listen, if you go into to
it with a negative attitude

235
00:12:50,437 --> 00:12:52,272
it's going to be bad.

236
00:12:54,441 --> 00:12:55,843
It's just one night.

237
00:12:57,044 --> 00:12:59,012
And I'll be there with
you the whole time.

238
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:01,982
I love you.

239
00:13:02,015 --> 00:13:03,483
I love you too.

240
00:13:03,516 --> 00:13:05,418
(smooch)

241
00:13:05,452 --> 00:13:07,354
Want me to finish unpacking?

242
00:13:07,387 --> 00:13:08,455
No leave them.

243
00:13:08,488 --> 00:13:11,024
Let her know how inconvenient
this whole thing is.

244
00:13:13,093 --> 00:13:15,028
(birds chirping)

245
00:13:29,476 --> 00:13:32,212
(light, sensitive music)

246
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:22,529
(laughing, chattering)

247
00:14:24,397 --> 00:14:25,498
That's good.

248
00:14:25,532 --> 00:14:27,167
Okay.

249
00:14:34,574 --> 00:14:36,910
And so, my mother sees
me on the floor that day

250
00:14:36,944 --> 00:14:37,677
and my brother's not there

251
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,346
so she picks me up, she running.

252
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:41,982
Can you imagine having
something this nice?

253
00:14:42,015 --> 00:14:43,917
And let me tell you
who's delighted is Luke.

254
00:14:45,152 --> 00:14:46,519
Yikes.

255
00:14:46,553 --> 00:14:48,922
(laughing)

256
00:14:48,956 --> 00:14:50,257
Fair fight, huh?

257
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:51,258
Fair kind of conversation
to be part of.

258
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:51,992
That's good.

259
00:14:52,025 --> 00:14:53,293
That's good.

260
00:15:15,615 --> 00:15:17,617
Jenny, oh my goodness, hi.

261
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:18,585
Hi.

262
00:15:18,618 --> 00:15:20,187
How are you?

263
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:20,520
Look at you.

264
00:15:20,553 --> 00:15:21,989
Oh.

265
00:15:22,022 --> 00:15:22,589
[Burnett Woman]
You look amazing.

266
00:15:22,622 --> 00:15:23,991
[Jennifer] Thank you.

267
00:15:24,024 --> 00:15:24,724
[Burnett Woman] How
far along are you?

268
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:26,459
[Jennifer] About seven months.

269
00:15:26,493 --> 00:15:27,260
[Burnett Woman] When did
you get home from Chicago?

270
00:15:27,294 --> 00:15:28,495
Just a few days ago.

271
00:15:28,528 --> 00:15:29,462
If you'll excuse
me, I'm so sorry,

272
00:15:29,496 --> 00:15:30,663
I just have to take
care of a few things.

273
00:15:30,697 --> 00:15:31,331
[Woman] It's great to see you.

274
00:15:31,364 --> 00:15:32,132
You too.

275
00:15:32,165 --> 00:15:32,599
She looks amazing.

276
00:15:32,632 --> 00:15:33,433
[Woman] Yeah.

277
00:15:39,539 --> 00:15:40,440
Excuse me.

278
00:15:40,473 --> 00:15:41,308
Oh.

279
00:15:41,341 --> 00:15:42,442
(laughing)

280
00:15:42,475 --> 00:15:43,243
I'm sorry.

281
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:44,711
[Man] Sorry.

282
00:15:44,744 --> 00:15:46,546
Um, I don't
believe we have met.

283
00:15:46,579 --> 00:15:47,480
I'm Jenn.

284
00:15:47,514 --> 00:15:48,448
You're Jennifer, right?

285
00:15:49,482 --> 00:15:50,383
Yes.

286
00:15:50,417 --> 00:15:51,551
I'm Walter, Walter Vance.

287
00:15:51,584 --> 00:15:53,320
Very nice to meet you.

288
00:15:53,353 --> 00:15:54,521
You're a friend
of my mother's?

289
00:15:54,554 --> 00:15:57,124
An old friend, yes, yes.

290
00:15:57,157 --> 00:15:59,459
I must say Jennifer, this is

291
00:15:59,492 --> 00:16:01,328
quite the house you have here.

292
00:16:01,361 --> 00:16:03,063
Hmm, it's

293
00:16:03,096 --> 00:16:04,397
unique.

294
00:16:04,431 --> 00:16:05,498
Oh very unique.

295
00:16:05,532 --> 00:16:06,666
Yes.

296
00:16:06,699 --> 00:16:08,468
Yes a very

297
00:16:08,501 --> 00:16:10,270
interesting energy.

298
00:16:12,239 --> 00:16:13,440
Thank you.

299
00:16:14,741 --> 00:16:15,842
Is there anything
I could get you?

300
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:17,710
I'm so very glad to hear
your baby's doing better.

301
00:16:20,547 --> 00:16:22,482
It was very close, wasn't it?

302
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:25,252
What was it, if
I may be so bold?

303
00:16:25,285 --> 00:16:27,020
Was the baby sick?

304
00:16:27,054 --> 00:16:29,122
Were you sick?

305
00:16:29,156 --> 00:16:30,590
Who told you about that?

306
00:16:30,623 --> 00:16:32,525
Walter?

307
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:33,493
(grunting)

308
00:16:33,526 --> 00:16:35,595
Oh, there you are, Walter.

309
00:16:35,628 --> 00:16:37,664
I've been looking
everywhere for you.

310
00:16:37,697 --> 00:16:39,132
Hello Katherine.

311
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:40,600
And I was just getting
to know Jennifer here.

312
00:16:40,633 --> 00:16:42,602
Oh Jennifer, what'd
you think of Walter, hmm?

313
00:16:42,635 --> 00:16:45,038
He's my most eccentric friend.

314
00:16:45,072 --> 00:16:46,039
[Walter] Now Katherine.

315
00:16:46,073 --> 00:16:47,340
No, it's true.

316
00:16:47,374 --> 00:16:49,642
Walter thinks himself
a bit of a psychic.

317
00:16:49,676 --> 00:16:52,212
Or is it medium, dear?

318
00:16:52,245 --> 00:16:54,047
Is that what you call yourself?

319
00:16:54,081 --> 00:16:55,148
Neither, actually.

320
00:16:55,182 --> 00:16:56,749
Pay no attention to her.

321
00:16:56,783 --> 00:16:59,286
I pick up on things, that's all.

322
00:16:59,319 --> 00:17:00,420
Energy.

323
00:17:00,453 --> 00:17:02,355
But I'm a chiropractor
by profession,

324
00:17:02,389 --> 00:17:03,356
just a chiropractor.

325
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:04,091
Just?

326
00:17:04,124 --> 00:17:04,691
Don't be silly.

327
00:17:04,724 --> 00:17:06,393
This man has a gift.

328
00:17:06,426 --> 00:17:08,295
Now if you'll
excuse us, Jennifer,

329
00:17:08,328 --> 00:17:11,431
I have some gossip I'm
just dying to tell him.

330
00:17:11,464 --> 00:17:13,500
Very nice to
meet you Jennifer.

331
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:23,476
(chattering, laughing)

332
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:48,801
(dark, ominous music)

333
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,509
Let's give her
some room, okay?

334
00:17:56,543 --> 00:17:58,711
I just don't want
it brought up, okay?

335
00:17:58,745 --> 00:17:59,646
Anymore.

336
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:00,580
Thank you.

337
00:18:00,613 --> 00:18:02,182
I know you'll understand.

338
00:18:02,215 --> 00:18:03,683
[Luke] Isn't that
right Jennifer?

339
00:18:03,716 --> 00:18:04,884
I'm sorry.

340
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:06,119
[Luke] I said
we're still deciding

341
00:18:06,153 --> 00:18:08,555
but we're thinking maybe Tyler.

342
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:11,258
Oh, yes, that's right.

343
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:12,625
Tyler.

344
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:52,399
[Luke] You're
being awfully quiet.

345
00:18:52,432 --> 00:18:53,766
Hmm.

346
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,835
It took a lot out of me.

347
00:18:55,868 --> 00:18:57,370
[Luke] What did she say?

348
00:18:57,404 --> 00:18:59,472
What didn't she say?

349
00:18:59,506 --> 00:19:01,574
Oh, I'm terribly
sorry about this mess.

350
00:19:02,675 --> 00:19:04,711
Terribly, terribly sorry.

351
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:09,216
She knows we haven't hung
up those damn curtains yet.

352
00:19:09,249 --> 00:19:09,949
God.

353
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:10,883
You know we might as well.

354
00:19:10,917 --> 00:19:11,818
Save us an earful, at least.

355
00:19:11,851 --> 00:19:12,652
Luke.

356
00:19:12,685 --> 00:19:13,853
They're not that
hideous, really.

357
00:19:13,886 --> 00:19:15,822
No, I'm not putting them up.

358
00:19:19,792 --> 00:19:22,629
Have you applied for
anything in Chicago?

359
00:19:22,662 --> 00:19:23,630
[Luke] It's been a week.

360
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:25,164
So, no.

361
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:29,802
We're going to be here at
least until the baby's born.

362
00:19:29,836 --> 00:19:31,938
That was the whole point
of this, you know that.

363
00:19:33,773 --> 00:19:34,674
(sighing)

364
00:19:34,707 --> 00:19:36,309
Look, I'll start looking soon

365
00:19:36,343 --> 00:19:37,510
but while we're here,

366
00:19:37,544 --> 00:19:38,611
you should at least try
to give it a chance.

367
00:19:38,645 --> 00:19:39,679
I am trying.

368
00:19:39,712 --> 00:19:40,613
We hosted the party.

369
00:19:40,647 --> 00:19:42,815
You didn't talk to anybody.

370
00:19:42,849 --> 00:19:43,950
You know, you could've made
an effort with these people.

371
00:19:43,983 --> 00:19:45,785
Try to make some friends.

372
00:19:46,953 --> 00:19:48,455
I like the friends I have.

373
00:20:19,652 --> 00:20:21,721
(rustling)

374
00:20:27,594 --> 00:20:28,661
Whoa.

375
00:20:28,695 --> 00:20:29,929
Sorry.

376
00:20:35,502 --> 00:20:37,570
(clattering)

377
00:20:37,604 --> 00:20:38,905
Someone's still here.

378
00:20:38,938 --> 00:20:40,340
What?

379
00:20:40,373 --> 00:20:42,041
In the bathroom,
there's someone there.

380
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:43,576
Go get rid of them.

381
00:20:52,018 --> 00:20:53,720
(knocking)

382
00:21:03,663 --> 00:21:04,997
(click)

383
00:21:15,975 --> 00:21:18,778
(dark, ominous music)

384
00:21:22,949 --> 00:21:25,485
(crickets chirping)

385
00:21:41,968 --> 00:21:43,470
They leave?

386
00:21:44,604 --> 00:21:46,072
Yeah.

387
00:21:50,943 --> 00:21:52,412
(sighing)

388
00:21:53,946 --> 00:21:55,715
I'm sorry.

389
00:21:57,450 --> 00:21:59,018
It took a lot out of me too.

390
00:22:01,854 --> 00:22:03,322
Come on.

391
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:25,545
Late?

392
00:22:25,578 --> 00:22:26,979
[Luke] Yeah.

393
00:22:27,013 --> 00:22:29,081
Forgot what it feels
like to be up this early.

394
00:22:32,985 --> 00:22:33,953
Wish me luck.

395
00:22:33,986 --> 00:22:34,621
Good luck.

396
00:22:34,654 --> 00:22:35,087
I love you.

397
00:22:35,121 --> 00:22:36,556
Love you.

398
00:23:23,069 --> 00:23:24,971
(knocking)

399
00:23:28,508 --> 00:23:30,810
(birds chirping)

400
00:23:41,821 --> 00:23:43,856
(knocking)

401
00:24:45,151 --> 00:24:47,554
(thumping)

402
00:24:48,855 --> 00:24:51,257
(dark, ominous music)

403
00:25:00,967 --> 00:25:02,902
(knocking)

404
00:25:08,074 --> 00:25:09,609
Yes?

405
00:25:09,642 --> 00:25:11,544
Is this a bad time?

406
00:25:11,578 --> 00:25:13,112
No.

407
00:25:13,145 --> 00:25:14,781
Can I help you?

408
00:25:14,814 --> 00:25:17,750
I'm Marlene, I live next door.

409
00:25:19,151 --> 00:25:20,653
Oh.

410
00:25:20,687 --> 00:25:22,789
Right, I'm sorry.

411
00:25:22,822 --> 00:25:24,724
I'm, Jennifer.

412
00:25:24,757 --> 00:25:27,226
I thought I'd bring you these.

413
00:25:27,259 --> 00:25:29,228
Welcome to the
neighborhood, all that.

414
00:25:29,261 --> 00:25:30,597
Thank you.

415
00:25:31,263 --> 00:25:32,932
It's very thoughtful.

416
00:25:33,866 --> 00:25:35,001
You're from around here?

417
00:25:35,034 --> 00:25:36,102
Chicago, actually.

418
00:25:36,135 --> 00:25:38,838
My husband, Luke and I,
we're just here for a bit.

419
00:25:38,871 --> 00:25:41,908
I, grew up around here though.

420
00:25:41,941 --> 00:25:43,042
Oh.

421
00:25:43,075 --> 00:25:44,543
Welcome home.

422
00:25:49,849 --> 00:25:51,884
It's a blessing.

423
00:25:51,918 --> 00:25:53,252
I'm sorry?

424
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:56,322
Oh.

425
00:25:56,355 --> 00:25:58,157
Thank you.

426
00:26:02,862 --> 00:26:04,296
Would you like to come inside?

427
00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:06,799
Oh no, I, I have to be going.

428
00:26:06,833 --> 00:26:08,901
I just wanted to say hello.

429
00:26:10,202 --> 00:26:12,071
Thank you for the cookies.

430
00:26:12,104 --> 00:26:13,706
Nice meeting you.

431
00:26:18,244 --> 00:26:20,179
(scrunching)

432
00:26:23,215 --> 00:26:25,584
(whirring, ticking)

433
00:26:40,199 --> 00:26:42,234
(groaning)

434
00:27:41,027 --> 00:27:43,295
(dark, menacing music)

435
00:27:54,106 --> 00:27:55,341
But he's one of
those newer supervisors

436
00:27:55,374 --> 00:27:56,375
anytime I asked him a question,

437
00:27:56,408 --> 00:27:57,844
he just give me the name

438
00:27:57,877 --> 00:27:59,445
of somebody else to
go talk to later on.

439
00:27:59,478 --> 00:28:00,780
I don't know, I think
he was just hired

440
00:28:00,813 --> 00:28:02,414
but he's really nice.

441
00:28:02,448 --> 00:28:03,983
You look bored to death.

442
00:28:05,084 --> 00:28:06,786
What?

443
00:28:06,819 --> 00:28:09,321
No, Morgan sounds nice.

444
00:28:09,355 --> 00:28:11,057
He sounds really

445
00:28:11,924 --> 00:28:13,259
nice.

446
00:28:15,795 --> 00:28:18,798
I'm sorry, I had a weird day.

447
00:28:18,831 --> 00:28:19,465
No, no, it's boring stuff.

448
00:28:19,498 --> 00:28:21,200
No, it's not really.

449
00:28:21,233 --> 00:28:23,169
I'm sure Morgan is very

450
00:28:23,202 --> 00:28:24,303
Nice.

451
00:28:25,905 --> 00:28:27,473
(laughing)

452
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:30,142
So what's up?

453
00:28:33,212 --> 00:28:36,482
Have you felt anything
off since moving here?

454
00:28:36,515 --> 00:28:38,417
In the house, I mean?

455
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:40,386
[Luke] Off how?

456
00:28:40,419 --> 00:28:42,454
Well, today

457
00:28:42,488 --> 00:28:46,058
these boxes moved on their own.

458
00:28:47,459 --> 00:28:48,861
I don't know.

459
00:28:48,895 --> 00:28:50,429
I just felt like my
head wasn't on right.

460
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,367
What?

461
00:28:55,401 --> 00:28:57,003
How long has
this been going on?

462
00:28:57,036 --> 00:28:58,370
Just today.

463
00:29:02,408 --> 00:29:04,243
It's probably nothing.

464
00:29:04,276 --> 00:29:05,377
Never mind.

465
00:29:05,411 --> 00:29:06,545
Jennifer, if you're starting
to feel strange again?

466
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:08,447
It's nothing.

467
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,849
Forget I said it.

468
00:29:12,151 --> 00:29:13,920
Just don't like being
here alone, that's all.

469
00:29:20,993 --> 00:29:22,394
(splashing)

470
00:29:22,428 --> 00:29:24,463
(gasping)

471
00:29:42,448 --> 00:29:44,984
(chattering, laughing)

472
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:52,458
No.

473
00:29:53,459 --> 00:29:55,061
No, no no, no.

474
00:29:56,062 --> 00:29:57,296
I don't care if you say no.

475
00:29:59,465 --> 00:30:01,033
No, no, no, do you hear me?

476
00:30:01,934 --> 00:30:03,369
No.

477
00:30:03,402 --> 00:30:05,137
No, no, no, no.

478
00:30:15,114 --> 00:30:17,149
(wind rustling)

479
00:30:19,485 --> 00:30:22,121
(fizzing, pattering)

480
00:30:33,966 --> 00:30:35,334
(creaking)

481
00:30:35,367 --> 00:30:36,502
Luke?

482
00:30:39,571 --> 00:30:40,873
Very funny.

483
00:30:46,612 --> 00:30:48,547
(dark, ominous music)

484
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:56,088
What're you doing?

485
00:31:02,128 --> 00:31:03,896
I'm almost done,
then it's all yours.

486
00:31:14,006 --> 00:31:15,307
Not now.

487
00:31:23,582 --> 00:31:24,951
Alright that's enough.

488
00:31:33,125 --> 00:31:34,460
I'm sorry, I

489
00:31:34,493 --> 00:31:36,528
I appreciate the
gesture, I really do.

490
00:31:36,562 --> 00:31:37,529
But.

491
00:31:37,563 --> 00:31:39,498
Talking to yourself?

492
00:31:39,531 --> 00:31:41,167
Thanks for keeping
the water warm for me.

493
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,301
Thanks honey.

494
00:31:59,318 --> 00:32:00,586
Luke.

495
00:32:00,619 --> 00:32:03,355
[Luke] Do we have any
of that creamer left?

496
00:32:03,389 --> 00:32:04,290
Luke?

497
00:32:04,323 --> 00:32:05,657
[Luke] Just a second.

498
00:32:13,632 --> 00:32:14,600
Luke.

499
00:32:14,633 --> 00:32:16,235
Hmm?

500
00:32:17,303 --> 00:32:18,537
Could we talk?

501
00:32:20,472 --> 00:32:21,707
Yeah what's up?

502
00:32:25,011 --> 00:32:26,612
There's um,

503
00:32:27,613 --> 00:32:28,614
there's something.

504
00:32:28,647 --> 00:32:29,748
(buzzing)

505
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:31,117
Hold that thought.

506
00:32:36,455 --> 00:32:37,523
I'm sorry, what were you saying?

507
00:32:37,556 --> 00:32:39,425
(knocking, gasping)

508
00:32:39,458 --> 00:32:41,360
(chuckling)

509
00:32:41,393 --> 00:32:42,561
I think you're gonna
wanna get that.

510
00:32:43,695 --> 00:32:45,364
What?

511
00:32:45,397 --> 00:32:46,698
Go on, get it.

512
00:32:51,137 --> 00:32:51,737
What's going on?

513
00:32:51,770 --> 00:32:53,305
Just open it.

514
00:32:56,608 --> 00:32:57,676
Look who's in town.

515
00:32:57,709 --> 00:32:58,677
(laughing)

516
00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:00,146
Lauren.

517
00:33:00,179 --> 00:33:01,547
Oh are you
surprised to see us?

518
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:02,781
What're you doing here?

519
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:04,250
I was gonna wait
till you were settled

520
00:33:04,283 --> 00:33:06,418
but the train is cheap
and I had nothing to do.

521
00:33:06,452 --> 00:33:07,653
God, I missed you,
I really miseed you.

522
00:33:07,686 --> 00:33:09,021
I can't believe you're here.

523
00:33:09,055 --> 00:33:10,122
Oh well, it was
Luke's idea really.

524
00:33:10,156 --> 00:33:11,257
I'd love to take all the credit

525
00:33:11,290 --> 00:33:12,491
but I guess your husband's just

526
00:33:12,524 --> 00:33:14,126
a better person
than your bestie.

527
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,427
(screaming)

528
00:33:15,461 --> 00:33:17,563
Oh god it is so good to see you.

529
00:33:17,596 --> 00:33:19,431
You have no idea.

530
00:33:28,674 --> 00:33:30,676
You know I've been
dying to see this place.

531
00:33:30,709 --> 00:33:33,145
I love it, by the way.

532
00:33:33,179 --> 00:33:36,248
So old, so bizarre.

533
00:33:38,484 --> 00:33:40,586
Okay, so

534
00:33:40,619 --> 00:33:42,354
real talk.

535
00:33:42,388 --> 00:33:45,491
I know you're probably
tired of people asking, but

536
00:33:45,524 --> 00:33:47,459
how are you feeling?

537
00:33:49,595 --> 00:33:51,663
Can I tell you something?

538
00:33:51,697 --> 00:33:54,400
And you have to promise to
keep an open mind about it.

539
00:33:54,433 --> 00:33:55,601
Yeah sure.

540
00:33:55,634 --> 00:33:56,735
What is it?

541
00:34:01,773 --> 00:34:03,475
I think this house is haunted.

542
00:34:06,212 --> 00:34:07,413
What?

543
00:34:07,446 --> 00:34:08,547
I don't know for
sure, it's just

544
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:11,683
some weird things have been
happening recently, and

545
00:34:11,717 --> 00:34:13,485
yeah, everything
feels so strange.

546
00:34:13,519 --> 00:34:16,122
Luke said you've
been feeling weird.

547
00:34:16,155 --> 00:34:17,756
He told you that?

548
00:34:17,789 --> 00:34:20,092
Well yeah, yeah, but I
mean he didn't mention,

549
00:34:20,126 --> 00:34:21,660
he didn't say that it was.

550
00:34:21,693 --> 00:34:24,796
You think this house is haunted?

551
00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:26,732
Tell me everything.

552
00:34:26,765 --> 00:34:28,334
Things move.

553
00:34:28,367 --> 00:34:30,202
Strange noises.

554
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:33,639
I thought someone was in the
shower with me this morning.

555
00:34:33,672 --> 00:34:35,174
No way.

556
00:34:35,207 --> 00:34:36,775
And did you tell Luke
about any of this?

557
00:34:36,808 --> 00:34:38,344
I tried.

558
00:34:38,377 --> 00:34:39,545
But the moment I
mentioned I felt something

559
00:34:39,578 --> 00:34:41,313
he got upset.

560
00:34:41,347 --> 00:34:43,282
And I mean I think
he thought it was

561
00:34:43,315 --> 00:34:44,850
the whole baby thing.

562
00:34:44,883 --> 00:34:47,253
You're sure it's not?

563
00:34:47,286 --> 00:34:48,487
What?

564
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:50,422
[Lauren] I mean your
sure it's not stress or

565
00:34:51,757 --> 00:34:52,858
hormones?

566
00:34:52,891 --> 00:34:56,128
Hormones don't open doors
and move boxes, Lauren.

567
00:34:57,596 --> 00:35:00,832
Look, I get why you might

568
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:03,869
why you and Luke might not.

569
00:35:07,573 --> 00:35:09,875
Things got really confused
back in Chicago, right before.

570
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:12,844
You know, I.

571
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:16,815
I was feeling a lot of things

572
00:35:16,848 --> 00:35:18,617
and I

573
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,455
I couldn't handle it.

574
00:35:26,558 --> 00:35:28,727
But this is something different.

575
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,762
Lauren please, you
gotta believe me.

576
00:35:30,796 --> 00:35:31,763
This is something else.

577
00:35:31,797 --> 00:35:33,232
I believe you.

578
00:35:35,934 --> 00:35:37,503
Thanks.

579
00:35:38,737 --> 00:35:40,272
So

580
00:35:41,207 --> 00:35:42,808
What're you gonna do?

581
00:35:43,775 --> 00:35:45,711
I don't know.

582
00:35:45,744 --> 00:35:46,845
I mean, what're
you supposed to do

583
00:35:46,878 --> 00:35:48,714
when your house is haunted?

584
00:35:48,747 --> 00:35:49,781
Pull out a ouija board?

585
00:35:49,815 --> 00:35:51,283
Call a medium.

586
00:35:51,317 --> 00:35:52,751
(chuckling)

587
00:35:55,754 --> 00:35:57,323
There was this
guy at our party,

588
00:35:57,356 --> 00:35:59,258
my Mom's chiropractor.

589
00:35:59,291 --> 00:36:01,360
His friend said he was psychic.

590
00:36:02,694 --> 00:36:04,896
Your Mom knows a
psychic chiropractor?

591
00:36:06,598 --> 00:36:07,466
It's just.

592
00:36:07,499 --> 00:36:08,834
(laughing)

593
00:36:08,867 --> 00:36:09,468
(child cooing)

594
00:36:09,501 --> 00:36:10,702
Oh.

595
00:36:10,736 --> 00:36:12,338
Sounds like somebody's awake.

596
00:36:15,441 --> 00:36:16,308
That one?

597
00:36:16,342 --> 00:36:17,376
Ah hmm.

598
00:36:17,409 --> 00:36:18,210
And this one.

599
00:36:18,244 --> 00:36:18,844
(clattering)

600
00:36:18,877 --> 00:36:20,246
[Lauren] Oh, uh oh.

601
00:36:20,279 --> 00:36:22,248
Let's take this
one off over there.

602
00:36:22,281 --> 00:36:24,450
I can't find anything
at this address.

603
00:36:24,483 --> 00:36:25,984
There's an article from
the 70's about rezoning

604
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:26,918
but that's it.

605
00:36:26,952 --> 00:36:29,355
No deaths, no murders, nothing.

606
00:36:29,388 --> 00:36:30,322
[Lauren] So?

607
00:36:30,356 --> 00:36:31,723
So it doesn't make sense.

608
00:36:31,757 --> 00:36:32,824
I mean someone had to die here

609
00:36:32,858 --> 00:36:33,959
for there to be ghost, right?

610
00:36:33,992 --> 00:36:36,828
I don't think ghosts have
rules, Jennifer, I mean.

611
00:36:36,862 --> 00:36:37,863
You're thinking too small,

612
00:36:37,896 --> 00:36:39,531
what if

613
00:36:39,565 --> 00:36:41,933
what if your house is
cursed or it's a poltergeist

614
00:36:41,967 --> 00:36:43,702
or a demon?

615
00:36:43,735 --> 00:36:45,571
Great.

616
00:36:45,604 --> 00:36:47,839
I have an idea of
something that we can try.

617
00:36:47,873 --> 00:36:50,576
But we'll have to wait till
tonight when Brad's in bed.

618
00:36:50,609 --> 00:36:51,843
What is it?

619
00:36:51,877 --> 00:36:53,612
Oh I'm not gonna
ruin the surprise.

620
00:36:53,645 --> 00:36:55,447
I have to pee.

621
00:36:55,481 --> 00:36:56,648
Great.

622
00:36:56,682 --> 00:36:57,449
Can you watch him?

623
00:36:57,483 --> 00:36:58,250
[Jennifer] Yeah.

624
00:36:58,284 --> 00:36:58,984
[Lauren] Thanks.

625
00:37:02,288 --> 00:37:03,522
[Brad] Hi.

626
00:37:08,327 --> 00:37:09,628
Hi.

627
00:37:10,862 --> 00:37:12,030
Hi.

628
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:13,632
Hi Brad.

629
00:37:16,335 --> 00:37:17,803
Hi.

630
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:22,808
Hi.

631
00:37:27,513 --> 00:37:29,281
Brad, who're you talking to?

632
00:37:29,315 --> 00:37:30,916
Hmm.

633
00:37:33,885 --> 00:37:35,354
Hi.

634
00:37:40,359 --> 00:37:41,627
Brad.

635
00:37:42,528 --> 00:37:43,895
Do you see someone?

636
00:37:43,929 --> 00:37:45,931
(clattering)

637
00:37:47,333 --> 00:37:48,567
What do you see?

638
00:37:51,437 --> 00:37:52,971
It's a ghost in here.

639
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:57,042
(growling)

640
00:37:57,976 --> 00:37:59,478
(thudding, creaking)

641
00:38:00,846 --> 00:38:02,314
You know, I was thinking.

642
00:38:02,348 --> 00:38:03,582
Oh ho.

643
00:38:03,615 --> 00:38:04,650
You're alright?

644
00:38:04,683 --> 00:38:05,851
(gasping)

645
00:38:05,884 --> 00:38:06,518
[Jennifer] A door
closed upstairs.

646
00:38:06,552 --> 00:38:07,453
No way.

647
00:38:07,486 --> 00:38:08,687
[Jennifer] I just heard it.

648
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:09,621
Oh then we have
to go check it out.

649
00:38:09,655 --> 00:38:10,689
I'm not going up there.

650
00:38:10,722 --> 00:38:12,391
[Lauren] Fine I'll go.

651
00:38:18,530 --> 00:38:19,898
There's nothing up here.

652
00:38:28,073 --> 00:38:29,508
Hi.

653
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:38,550
The ghost is attacking,
mu, mu, mu, mum, mum.

654
00:38:54,433 --> 00:38:55,601
[Lauren] Shut the door.

655
00:38:55,634 --> 00:38:56,935
[Jennifer] Why?

656
00:38:56,968 --> 00:38:59,037
[Lauren] We have
to block any drafts.

657
00:39:02,574 --> 00:39:04,910
This is what I used to
do when we were kids.

658
00:39:04,943 --> 00:39:06,845
We shut the door, the windows.

659
00:39:06,878 --> 00:39:08,079
Turn off the air.

660
00:39:09,415 --> 00:39:11,850
And then you ask questions.

661
00:39:11,883 --> 00:39:14,620
And if the flame moves

662
00:39:14,653 --> 00:39:17,789
it's the spirit or the ghost
or whatever, responding.

663
00:39:17,823 --> 00:39:18,690
Lauren, I don't know.

664
00:39:18,724 --> 00:39:19,625
No, come on, here.

665
00:39:19,658 --> 00:39:20,992
You've to put your hands on it.

666
00:39:29,601 --> 00:39:30,836
Now what?

667
00:39:30,869 --> 00:39:31,837
Ask something.

668
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:34,139
I don't know what to ask.

669
00:39:34,172 --> 00:39:35,841
Fine then I'll ask.

670
00:39:38,844 --> 00:39:40,946
Is there somebody down here

671
00:39:40,979 --> 00:39:42,013
in the basement with us?

672
00:39:42,047 --> 00:39:43,081
Jesus Christ Lauren, don't.

673
00:39:43,114 --> 00:39:44,616
Shh.

674
00:39:46,718 --> 00:39:50,589
Is there somebody or something

675
00:39:51,657 --> 00:39:53,158
here with us now?

676
00:39:57,929 --> 00:40:02,167
If there is something
in this house

677
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:05,937
please make yourself known.

678
00:40:08,574 --> 00:40:10,676
Show us that you're here.

679
00:40:12,143 --> 00:40:13,779
Give us a sign.

680
00:40:24,556 --> 00:40:26,124
Lauren, look.

681
00:40:27,058 --> 00:40:28,927
(laughing)

682
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,028
You jerk.

683
00:40:30,061 --> 00:40:30,962
I'm sorry, it's just so.

684
00:40:30,996 --> 00:40:32,998
(thumping)

685
00:40:33,031 --> 00:40:34,533
What the hell was that?

686
00:40:36,535 --> 00:40:37,503
Lauren, where you going?

687
00:40:37,536 --> 00:40:38,236
Oh we gotta make contact.

688
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:39,871
[Jennifer] Wait a minute.

689
00:40:41,607 --> 00:40:43,041
Lauren, stop.

690
00:40:43,074 --> 00:40:45,176
Whatever you
are, show yourself.

691
00:40:46,211 --> 00:40:47,145
[Jennifer] Come on,
let's just go outside.

692
00:40:47,178 --> 00:40:49,114
Shit.

693
00:40:49,147 --> 00:40:50,649
Something's coming.

694
00:40:52,217 --> 00:40:53,151
Lauren.

695
00:40:53,184 --> 00:40:54,653
Come on, come on, come on.

696
00:40:54,686 --> 00:40:55,253
Lauren, no.

697
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:56,087
(screaming)

698
00:40:56,121 --> 00:40:57,088
Whoa, what's going on?

699
00:40:57,122 --> 00:40:59,057
Holy shit.

700
00:40:59,090 --> 00:41:00,559
Oh my god you had us so scared.

701
00:41:00,592 --> 00:41:01,527
Yeah I can see that.

702
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:02,494
What're you doing?

703
00:41:02,528 --> 00:41:03,795
We are amateur ghost hunters

704
00:41:03,829 --> 00:41:05,196
and we thought that
you were our ghost.

705
00:41:05,230 --> 00:41:06,632
Ghost hunters?

706
00:41:06,665 --> 00:41:08,634
Oh my god, you
had me so scared.

707
00:41:08,667 --> 00:41:10,035
I need wine.

708
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:15,106
You were hunting ghosts?

709
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:17,075
We were.

710
00:41:17,108 --> 00:41:18,777
You think the
house is haunted?

711
00:41:20,245 --> 00:41:21,780
Yes.

712
00:41:21,813 --> 00:41:24,082
Why didn't you tell me?

713
00:41:24,115 --> 00:41:25,183
I tried.

714
00:41:25,216 --> 00:41:26,151
I don't know.

715
00:41:26,184 --> 00:41:27,653
Ah come here.

716
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,155
The house isn't haunted.

717
00:41:30,188 --> 00:41:32,290
There's no such thing as ghosts.

718
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:35,193
Oh my god, my heart is
just beating out of my chest.

719
00:41:35,226 --> 00:41:37,162
Seriously, you're
lucky I like you.

720
00:41:37,195 --> 00:41:39,097
Wait, that's it?

721
00:41:39,130 --> 00:41:40,298
I mean we're done now?

722
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:42,100
The footsteps were
Luke's so we're done?

723
00:41:44,803 --> 00:41:46,171
Jennifer I've
been here all day

724
00:41:46,204 --> 00:41:48,239
and nothing has happened.

725
00:41:48,273 --> 00:41:49,741
The door shut by itself.

726
00:41:49,775 --> 00:41:51,843
Listen, I get it.

727
00:41:51,877 --> 00:41:53,178
New houses are scary.

728
00:41:53,211 --> 00:41:54,813
Believe me every
time I move somewhere

729
00:41:54,846 --> 00:41:57,215
I'm convinced it's
haunted and it never is.

730
00:41:58,750 --> 00:42:01,119
There's always an
explanation for everything.

731
00:42:01,152 --> 00:42:02,220
[Luke] Yeah.

732
00:42:05,156 --> 00:42:07,192
[Lauren] Oh, um did we leave
the door open downstairs?

733
00:42:07,225 --> 00:42:08,594
I'll get it.

734
00:42:18,203 --> 00:42:19,805
(click)

735
00:42:35,353 --> 00:42:38,724
(dark, ominous music)

736
00:42:48,299 --> 00:42:50,201
(thudding)

737
00:42:55,073 --> 00:42:56,642
Lauren, Luke.

738
00:42:57,342 --> 00:42:59,077
(laughing, chattering)

739
00:43:00,078 --> 00:43:01,947
[Luke] That is not true.

740
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:03,682
[Lauren] Well
obviously it's not true.

741
00:43:03,715 --> 00:43:04,950
[Luke] It's not true.

742
00:43:04,983 --> 00:43:05,751
At all.

743
00:43:05,784 --> 00:43:06,685
[Lauren] Yeah, okay.

744
00:43:06,718 --> 00:43:07,152
[Luke] Let me finish the joke.

745
00:43:07,185 --> 00:43:09,254
Okay, so.

746
00:43:09,287 --> 00:43:10,221
You never listen.

747
00:43:10,255 --> 00:43:11,156
[Lauren] Well I'm listening.

748
00:43:11,189 --> 00:43:12,157
No, no you never listen.

749
00:43:12,190 --> 00:43:12,691
I am listening.

750
00:43:12,724 --> 00:43:13,291
No.

751
00:43:13,324 --> 00:43:14,960
Luke, I am listening.

752
00:43:14,993 --> 00:43:16,127
[Jennifer] There's a hand
print in the crawlspace.

753
00:43:17,295 --> 00:43:18,396
A what?

754
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:20,098
A hand print

755
00:43:21,166 --> 00:43:22,801
in the crawlspace.

756
00:43:23,869 --> 00:43:25,236
So?

757
00:43:26,437 --> 00:43:28,373
So how did it get there?

758
00:43:29,708 --> 00:43:31,242
Well, I

759
00:43:31,276 --> 00:43:33,044
checked the traps a
couple of days ago

760
00:43:33,078 --> 00:43:35,681
set a few new ones,
it's probably mine.

761
00:43:35,714 --> 00:43:36,948
Jennifer stop
freaking yourself out,

762
00:43:36,982 --> 00:43:39,951
just come, come sit
with us and talk, okay?

763
00:43:39,985 --> 00:43:41,419
Luke was just telling
me a really funny joke.

764
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:43,021
Come on.

765
00:43:43,054 --> 00:43:43,989
[Luke] Okay so
there're two hunters

766
00:43:44,022 --> 00:43:45,323
they're amateur hunters

767
00:43:45,356 --> 00:43:46,958
[Lauren] Two hunters?

768
00:43:46,992 --> 00:43:47,893
[Luke] And the pro hunters,
they already shot a deer

769
00:43:47,926 --> 00:43:49,160
and they're back at the place.

770
00:43:55,734 --> 00:43:57,202
(swoosh)

771
00:44:29,968 --> 00:44:31,903
[Jennifer] Luke?

772
00:44:31,937 --> 00:44:33,338
What're you doing up?

773
00:44:38,009 --> 00:44:39,911
[Luke] Someone is
laughing up there?

774
00:44:47,919 --> 00:44:49,354
Laughing?

775
00:44:51,289 --> 00:44:53,324
[Luke] They keep
saying your name.

776
00:44:53,358 --> 00:44:54,359
[Jennifer] Luke, what are you?

777
00:44:54,392 --> 00:44:55,393
(growling)

778
00:44:55,426 --> 00:44:57,095
(gasping)

779
00:44:58,396 --> 00:44:59,865
What'd you say?

780
00:45:01,066 --> 00:45:02,233
[Jennifer] You heard that?

781
00:45:04,435 --> 00:45:07,005
Luke I didn't say
anything, it wasn't me.

782
00:45:07,038 --> 00:45:08,373
[Luke] Okay.

783
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:10,475
(creaking)

784
00:45:26,491 --> 00:45:28,093
Brad.

785
00:45:29,027 --> 00:45:29,795
What's wrong?

786
00:45:29,828 --> 00:45:30,996
What're you doing up?

787
00:45:33,498 --> 00:45:35,300
Brad?

788
00:45:35,333 --> 00:45:36,367
I can't sleep.

789
00:45:38,403 --> 00:45:40,238
Why not?

790
00:45:40,271 --> 00:45:41,339
I'm scared.

791
00:45:45,143 --> 00:45:46,912
There's someone in there.

792
00:45:52,117 --> 00:45:55,320
There's someone in
here like a ghost.

793
00:45:55,353 --> 00:45:57,488
Brad?

794
00:45:57,522 --> 00:45:58,924
Brad what is it?

795
00:45:58,957 --> 00:46:00,892
Is it what you
saw earlier today?

796
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:03,361
Brad look at me, what is it?

797
00:46:03,394 --> 00:46:04,295
What did you see?

798
00:46:04,329 --> 00:46:05,096
Come on.

799
00:46:05,130 --> 00:46:06,431
What did you see?

800
00:46:06,464 --> 00:46:07,365
Brad?

801
00:46:07,398 --> 00:46:08,433
Brad look at me, what is it?

802
00:46:08,466 --> 00:46:09,467
Brad what did you see?

803
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:10,401
What did you see?

804
00:46:10,435 --> 00:46:11,803
Tell me, what did you see?

805
00:46:13,271 --> 00:46:15,240
(clattering)

806
00:46:29,020 --> 00:46:31,356
(screaming)

807
00:46:31,389 --> 00:46:33,024
What's going on?

808
00:46:33,058 --> 00:46:33,825
What going on?

809
00:46:33,859 --> 00:46:34,559
What happened?

810
00:46:34,592 --> 00:46:35,360
There's something out here.

811
00:46:35,393 --> 00:46:37,028
Why is Brad out here?

812
00:46:37,062 --> 00:46:38,363
I heard him out here, I came
out to see what was wrong.

813
00:46:38,396 --> 00:46:39,264
He's bleeding.

814
00:46:39,297 --> 00:46:39,931
[Luke] What?

815
00:46:39,965 --> 00:46:41,199
Is he okay?

816
00:46:41,232 --> 00:46:42,133
[Lauren] No, do you
have a first aid kit?

817
00:46:42,167 --> 00:46:42,600
[Luke] In the bathroom.

818
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:43,801
Lauren?

819
00:46:47,405 --> 00:46:49,507
(Brad crying)

820
00:46:55,146 --> 00:46:56,247
Luke, I swear.

821
00:46:56,281 --> 00:46:57,448
Stop.

822
00:46:58,583 --> 00:47:00,218
It's three in the morning.

823
00:47:01,953 --> 00:47:02,587
There was someone.

824
00:47:02,620 --> 00:47:05,056
No, stop.

825
00:47:05,090 --> 00:47:07,392
[Lauren] Come here,
it's okay, shh, come here.

826
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:17,502
(wind howling)

827
00:47:23,574 --> 00:47:25,443
Are you sure you're
gonna be okay?

828
00:47:25,476 --> 00:47:27,545
I mean I can stay another
day, if you guys want.

829
00:47:27,578 --> 00:47:30,882
No, it's fine really,
thanks for coming.

830
00:47:30,916 --> 00:47:32,450
Yeah, Luke, thanks.

831
00:47:32,483 --> 00:47:33,985
[Luke] You're welcome.

832
00:47:34,019 --> 00:47:35,320
Come here bud.

833
00:47:36,587 --> 00:47:37,555
Say goodbye.

834
00:47:37,588 --> 00:47:38,223
Bye.

835
00:47:38,256 --> 00:47:38,890
[Luke] Bye.

836
00:47:38,924 --> 00:47:39,624
Alright.

837
00:47:42,593 --> 00:47:44,362
I know, we're
going, we're going.

838
00:47:45,997 --> 00:47:47,298
Miss you, love you.

839
00:47:48,333 --> 00:47:49,500
Miss you, love you.

840
00:48:04,015 --> 00:48:05,416
What's going on?

841
00:48:06,251 --> 00:48:07,485
I told you.

842
00:48:13,024 --> 00:48:14,392
The house is haunted?

843
00:48:18,063 --> 00:48:20,065
Then how come I
haven't seen anything?

844
00:48:20,098 --> 00:48:22,433
I live here too you know,
I haven't seen a thing.

845
00:48:22,467 --> 00:48:23,668
But I have.

846
00:48:25,570 --> 00:48:27,072
That should be enough.

847
00:48:28,373 --> 00:48:29,474
Well what do
you suggest we do?

848
00:48:29,507 --> 00:48:30,341
I wanna move.

849
00:48:30,375 --> 00:48:31,476
Honey, we can't move.

850
00:48:31,509 --> 00:48:32,677
Then I wanna call someone.

851
00:48:32,710 --> 00:48:35,046
To have someone come in here
and figure out what's going on.

852
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:36,514
Jennifer there's

853
00:48:36,547 --> 00:48:37,715
nothing going on.

854
00:48:37,748 --> 00:48:39,650
There was a man at
the house warming party.

855
00:48:39,684 --> 00:48:42,187
A friend of my mother's, he
said he picked up on things

856
00:48:42,220 --> 00:48:44,555
and that our house has
an interesting energy.

857
00:48:44,589 --> 00:48:46,657
Okay, so our house has
an interesting energy.

858
00:48:46,691 --> 00:48:48,559
Fine.

859
00:48:48,593 --> 00:48:50,028
Did he say get out of the house

860
00:48:50,061 --> 00:48:50,996
or there's a ghost
in there with you?

861
00:48:51,029 --> 00:48:51,562
I'm gonna call him.

862
00:48:51,596 --> 00:48:52,563
No.

863
00:48:52,597 --> 00:48:54,499
Jennifer you're not.

864
00:48:54,532 --> 00:48:56,634
Please, I'm starting to
get a little worried here.

865
00:48:56,667 --> 00:48:58,169
This is all starting to sound
like what happened in Chicago.

866
00:48:58,203 --> 00:48:59,537
Luke.

867
00:49:04,575 --> 00:49:05,576
I saw something.

868
00:49:05,610 --> 00:49:07,545
You didn't see anything.

869
00:49:10,048 --> 00:49:11,516
God you're stressed.

870
00:49:12,683 --> 00:49:14,685
Your mind's playing
tricks on you that's all.

871
00:49:15,686 --> 00:49:18,289
Look, it's like
what Lauren said,

872
00:49:18,323 --> 00:49:20,725
"There's an explanation
for everything."

873
00:49:22,027 --> 00:49:23,661
The next time something
happens, confront it.

874
00:49:23,694 --> 00:49:25,530
Go see what it is.

875
00:49:26,731 --> 00:49:29,267
Stay calm.

876
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:31,302
Go at it rationally.

877
00:49:33,804 --> 00:49:36,041
And I think your
ghosts will go away.

878
00:49:37,575 --> 00:49:39,610
And what if they don't?

879
00:49:39,644 --> 00:49:41,212
They will.

880
00:49:42,247 --> 00:49:44,215
Give it a few days.

881
00:49:44,249 --> 00:49:45,583
I promise.

882
00:49:56,561 --> 00:49:58,129
(knocking)

883
00:50:00,165 --> 00:50:01,732
[Delivery Man] Mrs. Branagan?

884
00:50:01,766 --> 00:50:02,667
Yes.

885
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:04,402
I need you to sign
here for me please.

886
00:50:06,604 --> 00:50:08,406
Need help carrying this in?

887
00:50:08,439 --> 00:50:09,574
No thank you, I'll be fine.

888
00:50:09,607 --> 00:50:12,009
Well don't go hauling that
thing upstairs alone now.

889
00:50:13,178 --> 00:50:15,146
Get your husband to take it up.

890
00:50:15,180 --> 00:50:17,082
(dark, ominous music)

891
00:51:07,465 --> 00:51:08,266
(thud)

892
00:51:08,299 --> 00:51:10,335
(gasping)

893
00:51:10,368 --> 00:51:11,802
(grunting)

894
00:51:18,876 --> 00:51:20,778
(clattering)

895
00:51:24,515 --> 00:51:25,616
(screaming)

896
00:51:25,650 --> 00:51:27,485
[Jennifer] No, no.

897
00:51:28,353 --> 00:51:29,487
Help.

898
00:51:30,355 --> 00:51:32,123
(gurgling)

899
00:51:36,194 --> 00:51:37,862
(screaming)

900
00:51:55,713 --> 00:51:57,715
Jennifer, my dear how are you?

901
00:51:57,748 --> 00:51:58,883
Thank you for coming, Walter.

902
00:51:58,916 --> 00:52:00,718
Not at all.

903
00:52:00,751 --> 00:52:03,921
I must say, I was
a bit surprised to
receive your call but

904
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:05,390
delighted though.

905
00:52:07,192 --> 00:52:08,859
And you must be Luke.

906
00:52:14,932 --> 00:52:16,334
[Jennifer] What're
you doing here?

907
00:52:16,367 --> 00:52:17,635
I heard there was
a party here tonight.

908
00:52:17,668 --> 00:52:19,304
Little birdie told me.

909
00:52:19,337 --> 00:52:20,671
Am I late?

910
00:52:23,674 --> 00:52:26,311
And Meredith,
lovely as always.

911
00:52:30,915 --> 00:52:33,784
Well, I suppose we
should give this a go.

912
00:52:34,885 --> 00:52:36,721
Let's head upstairs shall we?

913
00:52:38,923 --> 00:52:41,459
(dark, melodious music)

914
00:53:20,431 --> 00:53:23,934
Luke, Meredith, would you
excuse us for a few minutes?

915
00:53:24,902 --> 00:53:25,870
I think it would be best

916
00:53:25,903 --> 00:53:28,639
if I had a little talk
with Jennifer, alone.

917
00:53:29,674 --> 00:53:31,476
[Luke] Wait, are you serious?

918
00:53:31,509 --> 00:53:33,411
I think it would be best.

919
00:53:34,512 --> 00:53:35,913
Let's go Luke.

920
00:53:35,946 --> 00:53:37,715
He's harmless.

921
00:53:37,748 --> 00:53:39,817
Let them have their fun.

922
00:53:41,852 --> 00:53:43,220
We won't be long.

923
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:53,498
I'm afraid I owe you
a bit of an apology.

924
00:53:55,466 --> 00:53:56,401
An apology?

925
00:53:56,434 --> 00:53:58,336
Yes.

926
00:53:58,369 --> 00:54:01,439
I should've been more clear
when agreeing to see you.

927
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:04,975
Your expectations may
not be met this evening.

928
00:54:06,711 --> 00:54:08,979
I don't know what
you're talking about.

929
00:54:09,013 --> 00:54:11,015
I'm not a medium, Jennifer.

930
00:54:11,048 --> 00:54:12,950
I'm not psychic.

931
00:54:12,983 --> 00:54:15,620
I've never done anything
like this before,

932
00:54:15,653 --> 00:54:17,322
reading.

933
00:54:17,355 --> 00:54:20,325
Oh I have tried in the past to

934
00:54:20,358 --> 00:54:22,860
contact the other
side, if you will but

935
00:54:23,961 --> 00:54:26,030
well I never had
much luck with that.

936
00:54:27,965 --> 00:54:29,934
You see, most people
expect someone like me

937
00:54:29,967 --> 00:54:32,036
to come in and tell them

938
00:54:32,069 --> 00:54:34,739
exactly what's going
on in their house.

939
00:54:34,772 --> 00:54:35,906
Who's to blame?

940
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:36,441
A name?

941
00:54:36,474 --> 00:54:38,075
A face?

942
00:54:38,108 --> 00:54:39,877
What they can do to stop it?

943
00:54:40,945 --> 00:54:43,614
But the very definition
of paranormal is

944
00:54:43,648 --> 00:54:46,684
that, that can not be
explained or defined.

945
00:54:46,717 --> 00:54:49,053
It is outside of our
knowledge, outside of our

946
00:54:49,086 --> 00:54:51,422
understanding of the world.

947
00:54:52,390 --> 00:54:53,791
It's the unknown.

948
00:54:54,925 --> 00:54:57,928
Which I suppose is why
it's so terrifying, huh?

949
00:55:00,931 --> 00:55:03,067
I'm fairly certain
there is something

950
00:55:03,100 --> 00:55:05,503
going on in your house.

951
00:55:05,536 --> 00:55:07,438
I felt it at the
night of the party.

952
00:55:08,606 --> 00:55:11,976
And I feel it now, here
in this room with us.

953
00:55:13,911 --> 00:55:16,581
But I'm afraid that's the
end of the line for me.

954
00:55:17,482 --> 00:55:20,618
I don't know what it is.

955
00:55:20,651 --> 00:55:22,987
And I don't think I can
answer your questions.

956
00:55:27,992 --> 00:55:29,460
So that's it?

957
00:55:30,695 --> 00:55:32,830
I mean you're not
even gonna try?

958
00:55:32,863 --> 00:55:33,898
Jennifer, I'd, I.

959
00:55:33,931 --> 00:55:34,999
So you're not a medium.

960
00:55:35,032 --> 00:55:35,933
Fine, but

961
00:55:35,966 --> 00:55:37,968
you said yourself you
pick up on things.

962
00:55:38,002 --> 00:55:39,904
And you feel something
here, you just said that.

963
00:55:39,937 --> 00:55:40,771
Yes, but.

964
00:55:40,805 --> 00:55:42,039
Then try.

965
00:55:42,072 --> 00:55:43,874
Please, just

966
00:55:43,908 --> 00:55:45,376
ask it.

967
00:55:45,410 --> 00:55:46,143
Ask it what it it is?

968
00:55:46,176 --> 00:55:48,012
What it wants from me?

969
00:55:49,146 --> 00:55:50,781
Please.

970
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:58,088
Do you know of anyone
who died in this house?

971
00:55:58,122 --> 00:55:59,590
Any trauma of any kind?

972
00:55:59,624 --> 00:56:00,758
No.

973
00:56:00,791 --> 00:56:01,959
I looked online, I
couldn't find anything.

974
00:56:01,992 --> 00:56:03,528
Nor I.

975
00:56:04,762 --> 00:56:06,864
This is just a house Jennifer.

976
00:56:08,065 --> 00:56:11,135
With seemingly no reason
why it should hold a ghost.

977
00:56:12,036 --> 00:56:14,104
Don't you see?

978
00:56:14,138 --> 00:56:16,874
I have tried.

979
00:56:16,907 --> 00:56:19,043
Whatever's here

980
00:56:19,076 --> 00:56:21,412
is much more
complicated than that.

981
00:56:26,917 --> 00:56:28,085
(sighing)

982
00:56:28,118 --> 00:56:29,887
Why are you here?

983
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:31,055
Excuse me?

984
00:56:31,088 --> 00:56:33,491
If you can't help me at all

985
00:56:33,524 --> 00:56:35,526
why did you even agree to come?

986
00:56:40,097 --> 00:56:43,100
I've tried for so many
years to ignore this thing.

987
00:56:44,669 --> 00:56:46,537
I guess I thought maybe
coming here tonight

988
00:56:46,571 --> 00:56:48,839
would be different that,

989
00:56:48,873 --> 00:56:51,175
finding I could help.

990
00:56:51,208 --> 00:56:53,010
I was curious.

991
00:56:54,044 --> 00:56:55,480
I'm sorry.

992
00:56:55,513 --> 00:56:57,181
I was wrong.

993
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:02,787
So you're wasting my time.

994
00:57:02,820 --> 00:57:03,721
Jennifer.

995
00:57:03,754 --> 00:57:04,855
You come into my house.

996
00:57:04,889 --> 00:57:07,858
You stare at my staircase
all mysterious and eerie.

997
00:57:07,892 --> 00:57:09,860
You say something about my baby,

998
00:57:09,894 --> 00:57:11,596
something you have
no way of knowing

999
00:57:11,629 --> 00:57:12,997
and then you come
over here tonight

1000
00:57:13,030 --> 00:57:15,065
and tell what's
been terrorizing me,

1001
00:57:15,099 --> 00:57:17,602
is more complicated then
some run of the mill ghost.

1002
00:57:17,635 --> 00:57:20,070
And also there's nothing
I can do about it.

1003
00:57:20,104 --> 00:57:20,738
Jennifer.

1004
00:57:20,771 --> 00:57:22,072
No, get out.

1005
00:57:22,106 --> 00:57:23,641
If you can't help me,
you need to leave.

1006
00:57:23,674 --> 00:57:24,909
Jennifer, please.

1007
00:57:24,942 --> 00:57:26,176
I need to figure out
what's going on here,

1008
00:57:26,210 --> 00:57:28,145
do you understand?

1009
00:57:28,178 --> 00:57:29,714
I have a real problem,

1010
00:57:29,747 --> 00:57:31,582
I need real help.

1011
00:57:32,216 --> 00:57:33,150
Get out.

1012
00:57:33,183 --> 00:57:33,818
Jennifer.

1013
00:57:33,851 --> 00:57:34,819
Get out.

1014
00:57:34,852 --> 00:57:36,220
(clattering)

1015
00:57:40,758 --> 00:57:43,494
(dark, mysterious music)

1016
00:57:45,930 --> 00:57:47,665
Walter?

1017
00:57:58,242 --> 00:57:59,076
I'll be off now.

1018
00:57:59,109 --> 00:58:01,211
Walter, wait,
what just happened?

1019
00:58:01,245 --> 00:58:04,181
Lovely seeing you
again, Jennifer.

1020
00:58:04,214 --> 00:58:05,783
No, please come back.

1021
00:58:05,816 --> 00:58:07,585
Walter.

1022
00:58:07,618 --> 00:58:09,286
No, stop.

1023
00:58:09,319 --> 00:58:10,154
Jennifer?

1024
00:58:10,187 --> 00:58:11,255
What's going on?

1025
00:58:11,288 --> 00:58:12,122
[Jennifer] Luke, stop
him, don't let him leave.

1026
00:58:12,156 --> 00:58:13,123
Walter?

1027
00:58:13,157 --> 00:58:14,058
You don't understand.

1028
00:58:14,091 --> 00:58:14,725
[Luke] Calm down, stop.

1029
00:58:14,759 --> 00:58:15,793
I'll call you.

1030
00:58:17,261 --> 00:58:18,796
(thump, grunting)

1031
00:58:24,268 --> 00:58:26,537
Are you trying to scare me?

1032
00:58:26,571 --> 00:58:28,172
Is that what this is?

1033
00:58:28,205 --> 00:58:30,207
You wanna go back
to Chicago so bad

1034
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:32,943
you're trying to scare me out
of this house, aren't you?

1035
00:58:32,977 --> 00:58:33,744
What?

1036
00:58:33,778 --> 00:58:35,045
I can't believe this.

1037
00:58:35,079 --> 00:58:35,980
I should've never
agreed to this.

1038
00:58:36,013 --> 00:58:37,181
There was no reason
for Walter to come.

1039
00:58:37,214 --> 00:58:39,083
What about the closet door?

1040
00:58:39,116 --> 00:58:40,551
How are you going
to explain that?

1041
00:58:40,585 --> 00:58:42,553
It's an old house.

1042
00:58:42,587 --> 00:58:44,121
It's old wood, it was

1043
00:58:44,154 --> 00:58:45,055
humidity.

1044
00:58:45,089 --> 00:58:47,091
These things happen, Jennifer.

1045
00:58:47,124 --> 00:58:48,125
I mean seriously,
you need to take

1046
00:58:48,158 --> 00:58:49,560
a step back for a second

1047
00:58:49,594 --> 00:58:51,528
and listen to yourself.

1048
00:58:52,196 --> 00:58:53,798
Ghosts?

1049
00:58:53,831 --> 00:58:55,633
A medium, for Christ's sake.

1050
00:58:55,666 --> 00:58:57,234
It's all just a little.

1051
00:58:57,267 --> 00:58:59,570
What?

1052
00:58:59,604 --> 00:59:01,305
It's all just a little what?

1053
00:59:02,372 --> 00:59:03,674
Crazy?

1054
00:59:03,708 --> 00:59:05,175
I didn't say that.

1055
00:59:06,877 --> 00:59:09,046
You didn't have to.

1056
00:59:09,079 --> 00:59:10,815
Fine.

1057
00:59:10,848 --> 00:59:12,049
If that's what you
want me to say,

1058
00:59:12,082 --> 00:59:13,250
you're right.

1059
00:59:13,283 --> 00:59:14,852
You're acting crazy.

1060
00:59:14,885 --> 00:59:16,987
Walter saw something.

1061
00:59:17,021 --> 00:59:18,288
Luke, you weren't there,

1062
00:59:18,322 --> 00:59:20,090
you didn't see the
look on his face.

1063
00:59:20,124 --> 00:59:22,159
He said there's something
complicated going on here.

1064
00:59:22,192 --> 00:59:23,293
I saw enough.

1065
00:59:23,327 --> 00:59:24,795
Well, Luke listen to me.

1066
00:59:24,829 --> 00:59:26,163
Listen to me.

1067
00:59:27,297 --> 00:59:29,166
If you came to me and told me,

1068
00:59:29,199 --> 00:59:30,300
you thought the
house was haunted,

1069
00:59:30,334 --> 00:59:32,603
I'd believe you or at least,

1070
00:59:32,637 --> 00:59:33,838
listen to you.

1071
00:59:33,871 --> 00:59:35,973
But I'm not coming to
you with any of that.

1072
00:59:37,174 --> 00:59:39,176
Because I don't think
the house is haunted.

1073
00:59:39,209 --> 00:59:40,144
And honestly,

1074
00:59:40,177 --> 00:59:42,212
I don't think there's
anything to figure out,

1075
00:59:42,246 --> 00:59:44,081
except why it's so
hard for you to focus

1076
00:59:44,114 --> 00:59:45,916
on anything other than yourself?

1077
00:59:47,885 --> 00:59:49,820
What?

1078
00:59:50,988 --> 00:59:52,356
No more ghosts.

1079
01:00:04,902 --> 01:00:06,937
(splashing)

1080
01:00:20,217 --> 01:00:21,919
Hello?

1081
01:00:39,937 --> 01:00:41,371
(clattering)

1082
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:53,317
(dark, ominous music)

1083
01:01:08,999 --> 01:01:11,001
(fizzing)

1084
01:01:32,990 --> 01:01:35,192
(thumping, thudding)

1085
01:01:38,162 --> 01:01:39,329
[Voiceover] Hi, you've
reached Walter Vance.

1086
01:01:39,363 --> 01:01:41,799
I'm not available at the moment
but please leave a message.

1087
01:01:41,832 --> 01:01:43,133
(beep)

1088
01:01:54,311 --> 01:01:55,813
(knocking)

1089
01:02:00,117 --> 01:02:01,318
Jennifer.

1090
01:02:01,351 --> 01:02:02,820
Hi, Marlene.

1091
01:02:04,955 --> 01:02:06,356
Can I come in?

1092
01:02:15,532 --> 01:02:17,134
Thank you.

1093
01:02:21,939 --> 01:02:23,273
Are these your daughters?

1094
01:02:23,307 --> 01:02:24,975
Uh hmm.

1095
01:02:25,009 --> 01:02:27,111
Lucy and Claire.

1096
01:02:29,814 --> 01:02:31,115
You're scared.

1097
01:02:32,516 --> 01:02:34,418
What?

1098
01:02:34,451 --> 01:02:36,320
You look scared.

1099
01:02:45,429 --> 01:02:46,263
Did you know the people

1100
01:02:46,296 --> 01:02:47,865
who lived in the
house before we did?

1101
01:02:47,898 --> 01:02:49,399
Hm hmm.

1102
01:02:49,433 --> 01:02:51,468
A family.

1103
01:02:51,501 --> 01:02:52,803
Nice people.

1104
01:02:56,406 --> 01:02:57,842
Do you know why they moved?

1105
01:02:59,076 --> 01:03:01,111
Just had somewhere
else to be I guess.

1106
01:03:01,145 --> 01:03:02,479
Happened pretty fast.

1107
01:03:05,449 --> 01:03:07,852
Do you know if they
experienced anything

1108
01:03:08,585 --> 01:03:11,355
strange in the house?

1109
01:03:11,388 --> 01:03:13,390
Strange?

1110
01:03:13,423 --> 01:03:14,925
Yeah, like

1111
01:03:17,094 --> 01:03:18,462
ghosts?

1112
01:03:20,530 --> 01:03:22,299
You think the
house is haunted?

1113
01:03:23,467 --> 01:03:24,801
I don't know.

1114
01:03:26,570 --> 01:03:28,105
Yes.

1115
01:03:28,138 --> 01:03:29,573
I think.

1116
01:03:29,606 --> 01:03:30,875
Have you ever?

1117
01:03:30,908 --> 01:03:32,276
Uh hmm.

1118
01:03:35,479 --> 01:03:37,114
'Cause I just
would feel better

1119
01:03:37,147 --> 01:03:39,349
if I knew someone else had
gone through it too, you know?

1120
01:03:40,517 --> 01:03:42,419
Luke doesn't believe me.

1121
01:03:42,452 --> 01:03:45,589
He thinks it's all in my head.

1122
01:03:45,622 --> 01:03:48,425
I feel like everything is
spinning out of control.

1123
01:03:48,458 --> 01:03:50,827
But I refuse to believe that it,

1124
01:03:54,098 --> 01:03:55,565
I mean there has
to be something.

1125
01:03:55,599 --> 01:03:57,534
Right?

1126
01:03:57,567 --> 01:03:59,169
Some sort of answer.

1127
01:04:06,210 --> 01:04:08,078
My daughters, they

1128
01:04:08,913 --> 01:04:10,414
they don't talk.

1129
01:04:14,518 --> 01:04:16,921
Since they were about four.

1130
01:04:16,954 --> 01:04:18,488
I had some guests over.

1131
01:04:19,556 --> 01:04:21,225
They made a game out of it.

1132
01:04:22,392 --> 01:04:24,628
I won't talk to mommy's
friends if you don't.

1133
01:04:27,631 --> 01:04:29,433
They haven't said
anything since.

1134
01:04:33,603 --> 01:04:36,040
It's called selective mutism.

1135
01:04:36,073 --> 01:04:39,476
There's nothing wrong
with them, they just

1136
01:04:39,509 --> 01:04:41,478
don't talk.

1137
01:04:42,980 --> 01:04:47,551
I took them to dozens of
doctors and therapists.

1138
01:04:49,219 --> 01:04:51,255
Nobody could tell me anything.

1139
01:04:53,190 --> 01:04:54,624
I went into debt,

1140
01:04:55,625 --> 01:04:57,427
I got obsessive,

1141
01:04:58,628 --> 01:05:00,597
I got mean.

1142
01:05:02,199 --> 01:05:04,368
I let my marriage fall apart.

1143
01:05:07,504 --> 01:05:11,575
And then about a year
ago I sat them down,

1144
01:05:11,608 --> 01:05:14,611
tried to explain things to them.

1145
01:05:14,644 --> 01:05:16,413
They'd never get a job,

1146
01:05:16,446 --> 01:05:19,183
never start a family, if they

1147
01:05:19,216 --> 01:05:20,550
didn't talk.

1148
01:05:23,753 --> 01:05:27,157
I told them if they could
just try a little harder,

1149
01:05:29,359 --> 01:05:31,295
help me out a little bit,

1150
01:05:33,530 --> 01:05:36,700
that they could get better.

1151
01:05:40,004 --> 01:05:41,671
They could talk again.

1152
01:05:47,544 --> 01:05:50,280
And then Lucy looked right at me

1153
01:05:50,314 --> 01:05:54,718
and she said, "We could
talk if we wanted to."

1154
01:05:56,386 --> 01:05:59,589
First thing she'd said
to me in 10 years.

1155
01:06:01,225 --> 01:06:03,693
"We could talk if we wanted to."

1156
01:06:09,666 --> 01:06:12,069
I used to think there was
a reason for all of it.

1157
01:06:13,470 --> 01:06:15,372
Now I'm not sure.

1158
01:06:17,207 --> 01:06:20,110
I think sometimes
things just happen.

1159
01:06:22,246 --> 01:06:27,051
There's no use ruining your
life looking for explanations.

1160
01:06:36,593 --> 01:06:38,762
My husband should
be getting home soon.

1161
01:06:41,698 --> 01:06:43,533
I'll walk you out.

1162
01:06:48,372 --> 01:06:50,340
I'm sorry for
barging in like that.

1163
01:06:50,374 --> 01:06:51,708
You're welcome any time.

1164
01:06:53,410 --> 01:06:54,644
Jennifer.

1165
01:06:57,581 --> 01:06:59,616
I hope you find what
you're looking for.

1166
01:07:05,755 --> 01:07:07,491
Luke?

1167
01:07:07,524 --> 01:07:08,792
[Luke] Up here.

1168
01:07:13,797 --> 01:07:15,399
Hey.

1169
01:07:18,268 --> 01:07:20,337
I know you don't wanna
talk about this but.

1170
01:07:20,370 --> 01:07:21,805
(clattering)

1171
01:07:22,639 --> 01:07:24,040
Did you hear that?

1172
01:07:25,375 --> 01:07:26,810
Luke, listen.

1173
01:07:28,778 --> 01:07:29,746
Oh.

1174
01:07:29,779 --> 01:07:31,415
(thud)

1175
01:07:33,617 --> 01:07:35,219
(banging)

1176
01:07:38,622 --> 01:07:39,656
Luke.

1177
01:07:42,126 --> 01:07:42,759
Jennifer.

1178
01:07:42,792 --> 01:07:43,427
(screaming)

1179
01:07:43,460 --> 01:07:44,361
What is it?

1180
01:07:44,394 --> 01:07:44,828
What's going on?

1181
01:07:44,861 --> 01:07:45,662
What is it?

1182
01:07:45,695 --> 01:07:46,663
Are you okay?

1183
01:07:46,696 --> 01:07:47,597
I just saw.

1184
01:07:47,631 --> 01:07:48,565
You were in the room with me.

1185
01:07:48,598 --> 01:07:50,066
What?

1186
01:07:51,768 --> 01:07:53,737
What's happening to me?

1187
01:07:54,871 --> 01:07:55,772
Oh boy.

1188
01:07:55,805 --> 01:07:57,374
Alright okay.

1189
01:08:00,410 --> 01:08:01,711
You're too wound up.

1190
01:08:02,746 --> 01:08:03,680
Just.

1191
01:08:03,713 --> 01:08:05,115
Luke.

1192
01:08:15,792 --> 01:08:17,461
It opens on its own.

1193
01:08:26,803 --> 01:08:28,805
(scraping)

1194
01:08:34,544 --> 01:08:35,712
Better?

1195
01:08:41,485 --> 01:08:42,752
Just rest.

1196
01:08:45,322 --> 01:08:47,391
I'll stay with you
till you fall asleep.

1197
01:09:13,483 --> 01:09:15,285
(thudding)

1198
01:09:24,861 --> 01:09:26,763
(dark, menacing music)

1199
01:09:40,977 --> 01:09:42,446
I get it.

1200
01:09:42,479 --> 01:09:44,214
(chattering)

1201
01:09:44,248 --> 01:09:45,349
Luke?

1202
01:09:45,382 --> 01:09:46,883
Oh jenny, you're up.

1203
01:09:49,619 --> 01:09:50,754
What's going on?

1204
01:09:50,787 --> 01:09:51,888
(chuckling)

1205
01:09:51,921 --> 01:09:52,789
Oh, we were just discussing

1206
01:09:52,822 --> 01:09:55,592
that you've been a
bit tired recently.

1207
01:09:55,625 --> 01:09:56,926
Weren't we?

1208
01:09:59,329 --> 01:10:00,530
Honey, why don't you sit down?

1209
01:10:00,564 --> 01:10:02,466
Will one of you
please tell me,

1210
01:10:02,499 --> 01:10:03,900
what's going on?

1211
01:10:05,502 --> 01:10:06,903
We're concerned.

1212
01:10:06,936 --> 01:10:09,939
Luke told me you gave him a
bit of a scare last night.

1213
01:10:09,973 --> 01:10:11,375
He did?

1214
01:10:11,408 --> 01:10:12,376
And he mentioned
that you were still

1215
01:10:12,409 --> 01:10:14,811
raving about ghosts?

1216
01:10:15,979 --> 01:10:17,581
It's just.

1217
01:10:18,415 --> 01:10:19,883
Well.

1218
01:10:19,916 --> 01:10:22,819
This has been going on for
quite some time, Jenny.

1219
01:10:22,852 --> 01:10:24,354
You've been acting strange

1220
01:10:24,388 --> 01:10:26,956
ever since you got back home.

1221
01:10:26,990 --> 01:10:28,892
And that stunt that
you pulled with Walter.

1222
01:10:28,925 --> 01:10:29,826
Stunt?

1223
01:10:29,859 --> 01:10:30,894
And hysterics last night.

1224
01:10:30,927 --> 01:10:31,828
Hysterics?

1225
01:10:31,861 --> 01:10:33,530
What are you talking about?

1226
01:10:33,563 --> 01:10:35,599
Well it all seems a bit
crazy, don't you think?

1227
01:10:38,835 --> 01:10:39,836
I'm not crazy.

1228
01:10:39,869 --> 01:10:41,771
Of course you're not, Jenny.

1229
01:10:41,805 --> 01:10:44,874
But you can understand why we
would both be alarmed, right?

1230
01:10:46,476 --> 01:10:49,646
There's something
going on in this house.

1231
01:10:51,415 --> 01:10:53,016
It scares me.

1232
01:10:53,983 --> 01:10:55,985
And it scares me even
more that the two.

1233
01:10:56,019 --> 01:10:58,655
Luke hasn't noticed
anything out of the ordinary.

1234
01:10:58,688 --> 01:10:59,556
That doesn't mean anything.

1235
01:10:59,589 --> 01:11:00,790
I don't understand.

1236
01:11:00,824 --> 01:11:03,026
We don't want you
hurting the baby again.

1237
01:11:07,697 --> 01:11:09,899
Now, I've made an
appointment for you

1238
01:11:09,933 --> 01:11:11,601
with a psychiatrist next week.

1239
01:11:11,635 --> 01:11:13,537
He's a very good friend of mine.

1240
01:11:13,570 --> 01:11:16,506
You'll see him three times a
week until the baby's born.

1241
01:11:16,540 --> 01:11:18,308
After that we'll reassess.

1242
01:11:20,910 --> 01:11:23,046
We just want what's
best for you.

1243
01:11:44,368 --> 01:11:47,070
(dark, threatening music)

1244
01:12:50,099 --> 01:12:52,035
(rustling)

1245
01:13:09,986 --> 01:13:11,921
What do you want from me?

1246
01:13:11,955 --> 01:13:13,790
(creaking)

1247
01:13:15,759 --> 01:13:17,894
(thudding)

1248
01:13:17,927 --> 01:13:18,995
(gasping)

1249
01:13:26,803 --> 01:13:28,438
(knocking)

1250
01:13:39,516 --> 01:13:41,017
Is your Mom home?

1251
01:13:42,919 --> 01:13:45,054
You Mom, Marlene is she home?

1252
01:13:47,123 --> 01:13:48,925
(groaning)

1253
01:13:51,995 --> 01:13:53,162
Please I need to
speak to someone.

1254
01:13:54,063 --> 01:13:55,732
You Mom, where is she?

1255
01:13:57,166 --> 01:13:58,535
Where is she?

1256
01:13:59,936 --> 01:14:02,005
Do you not understand
what I'm saying?

1257
01:14:04,974 --> 01:14:06,142
(dial tone)

1258
01:14:06,175 --> 01:14:08,111
[Voiceover] Hi, you've
reached Walter Vance.

1259
01:14:08,144 --> 01:14:10,213
I'm not available at the
moment but pleave a message.

1260
01:14:10,246 --> 01:14:11,548
(beep)

1261
01:14:11,581 --> 01:14:13,049
(groaning)

1262
01:14:20,289 --> 01:14:22,458
(screaming)

1263
01:14:24,628 --> 01:14:27,096
(light, melodious music)

1264
01:14:32,736 --> 01:14:33,737
Jenny?

1265
01:14:33,770 --> 01:14:35,639
What're you doing here?

1266
01:14:35,672 --> 01:14:37,073
Is everything okay?

1267
01:14:40,744 --> 01:14:43,079
Should I make some coffee?

1268
01:14:43,112 --> 01:14:44,614
I have decaf.

1269
01:14:46,182 --> 01:14:47,917
Coffee would be nice.

1270
01:15:21,350 --> 01:15:24,220
I know you and Luke just
want what's best for me.

1271
01:15:25,354 --> 01:15:26,089
I haven't.

1272
01:15:26,122 --> 01:15:27,256
I know Jenny.

1273
01:15:27,290 --> 01:15:28,892
I know.

1274
01:15:38,635 --> 01:15:40,103
This is nice.

1275
01:15:41,004 --> 01:15:42,572
It is, isn't it?

1276
01:15:54,984 --> 01:15:57,754
I have always cherished
our moments together.

1277
01:16:00,223 --> 01:16:02,759
Remember getting ready
for your pageants?

1278
01:16:05,094 --> 01:16:08,131
All that primping and preening.

1279
01:16:08,164 --> 01:16:10,133
Dolling you up.

1280
01:16:10,166 --> 01:16:11,701
(chuckling lightly)

1281
01:16:14,003 --> 01:16:16,572
Those are some of
my fondest memories.

1282
01:16:18,274 --> 01:16:20,076
You and me.

1283
01:16:22,946 --> 01:16:26,215
All that beauty and promise.

1284
01:16:31,254 --> 01:16:33,089
I have an idea.

1285
01:16:34,357 --> 01:16:36,159
(clicking)

1286
01:16:36,192 --> 01:16:38,662
You have always had
the most lovely hair.

1287
01:16:44,200 --> 01:16:46,202
I can't believe you're here.

1288
01:16:49,305 --> 01:16:51,307
Luke's in for quite
a shock tonight

1289
01:16:51,340 --> 01:16:54,343
when you get home
looking so beautiful.

1290
01:17:03,186 --> 01:17:05,321
I really am glad you're back.

1291
01:17:09,225 --> 01:17:11,360
I don't know what
happened with us.

1292
01:17:15,264 --> 01:17:18,034
But with the baby and the move

1293
01:17:18,067 --> 01:17:19,635
and everything,

1294
01:17:21,805 --> 01:17:24,908
I can't help but see
it as a second chance.

1295
01:17:28,011 --> 01:17:30,279
And who knows,

1296
01:17:30,313 --> 01:17:32,849
maybe the next one'll
be a little girl.

1297
01:17:34,951 --> 01:17:36,886
I have to use the restroom.

1298
01:17:36,920 --> 01:17:38,254
Okay.

1299
01:17:38,287 --> 01:17:40,223
I'll be here when you get back.

1300
01:17:55,271 --> 01:17:57,874
(thudding)

1301
01:17:57,907 --> 01:17:59,876
(squeaking)

1302
01:18:05,414 --> 01:18:06,983
(shattering)

1303
01:18:12,288 --> 01:18:13,389
[Jennifer] Luke just called.

1304
01:18:13,422 --> 01:18:14,323
I should get going.

1305
01:18:14,357 --> 01:18:15,291
We haven't finished your hair.

1306
01:18:15,324 --> 01:18:16,793
Oh I can just pin this back.

1307
01:18:16,826 --> 01:18:18,762
It sounded like
he had a hard day.

1308
01:18:26,870 --> 01:18:28,905
Jenny are you feeling okay?

1309
01:18:28,938 --> 01:18:30,006
Yes.

1310
01:18:30,039 --> 01:18:31,374
(thudding, gasping)

1311
01:18:33,843 --> 01:18:35,411
Jenny, why are you so jumpy?

1312
01:18:36,379 --> 01:18:37,981
Jenny what's happening?

1313
01:18:39,248 --> 01:18:40,917
I have to go.

1314
01:18:40,950 --> 01:18:42,451
Jenny?

1315
01:18:42,485 --> 01:18:44,253
Jenny?

1316
01:18:44,287 --> 01:18:46,823
(thump, shattering)

1317
01:18:46,856 --> 01:18:48,357
Jenny, what's wrong?

1318
01:18:50,426 --> 01:18:52,261
Jenny?

1319
01:18:52,295 --> 01:18:53,763
Jenny?

1320
01:18:55,431 --> 01:18:57,366
(car rumbling)

1321
01:18:58,968 --> 01:19:00,469
(knocking)

1322
01:19:00,503 --> 01:19:02,305
Walter?

1323
01:19:02,338 --> 01:19:03,907
Walter, please.

1324
01:19:11,815 --> 01:19:13,516
(screaming)

1325
01:19:13,549 --> 01:19:15,084
Ma'am?

1326
01:19:19,989 --> 01:19:21,357
Are you okay?

1327
01:19:23,126 --> 01:19:25,394
(dark, menacing music)

1328
01:19:36,005 --> 01:19:37,473
Get out of my head.

1329
01:19:40,609 --> 01:19:42,245
Get out.

1330
01:19:42,278 --> 01:19:43,379
Jennifer?

1331
01:19:43,412 --> 01:19:44,380
Jesus Christ.

1332
01:19:44,413 --> 01:19:46,415
Jennifer, Jennifer?

1333
01:19:46,449 --> 01:19:47,350
Luke.

1334
01:19:47,383 --> 01:19:48,017
Honey, what's going on?

1335
01:19:48,051 --> 01:19:48,818
What's going on?

1336
01:19:48,852 --> 01:19:50,086
It's the house.

1337
01:19:50,119 --> 01:19:51,287
We need to get
you to a doctor.

1338
01:19:51,320 --> 01:19:53,122
No, no, it isn't,
it's the house.

1339
01:19:53,156 --> 01:19:55,524
(growling)

1340
01:19:55,558 --> 01:19:57,827
Meredith?

1341
01:19:57,861 --> 01:20:00,463
Yeah, she's here, I don't know.

1342
01:20:00,496 --> 01:20:01,497
No, it's not good.

1343
01:20:01,530 --> 01:20:03,199
Get out.

1344
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:06,335
Meredith I gotta go,
we'll meet you there.

1345
01:20:07,236 --> 01:20:08,537
Jennifer,

1346
01:20:08,571 --> 01:20:09,338
stay here.

1347
01:20:09,372 --> 01:20:11,040
(gasping)

1348
01:20:11,074 --> 01:20:12,976
(thunder rumbling, pattering)

1349
01:20:13,009 --> 01:20:14,243
I'm gonna get you
out of the house.

1350
01:20:14,277 --> 01:20:16,079
I just need to call the doctor.

1351
01:20:16,112 --> 01:20:17,113
It's the house.

1352
01:20:17,146 --> 01:20:18,581
It's in my head.

1353
01:20:21,250 --> 01:20:23,086
It wants you to think I'm crazy.

1354
01:20:23,119 --> 01:20:24,387
[Luke] Stay here.

1355
01:20:31,427 --> 01:20:33,396
I'm here.

1356
01:20:33,429 --> 01:20:35,431
Tell me what you want.

1357
01:20:37,666 --> 01:20:39,468
(scraping)

1358
01:20:44,507 --> 01:20:46,242
(screaming)

1359
01:21:16,940 --> 01:21:18,541
Luke.

1360
01:21:22,478 --> 01:21:24,513
Luke.

1361
01:21:24,547 --> 01:21:26,349
(thudding)

1362
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:33,589
(gasping)

1363
01:21:33,622 --> 01:21:35,258
Jenny?

1364
01:21:35,291 --> 01:21:36,325
Luke, she's awake.

1365
01:21:36,359 --> 01:21:37,126
(whimpering)

1366
01:21:37,160 --> 01:21:38,161
No, no, no, no, sweety.

1367
01:21:38,194 --> 01:21:40,029
Lie down, lie down, lie down.

1368
01:21:40,063 --> 01:21:41,497
You need to rest.

1369
01:21:43,166 --> 01:21:44,233
What happened?

1370
01:21:44,267 --> 01:21:46,535
You had an accident.

1371
01:21:46,569 --> 01:21:48,304
We didn't if the baby was.

1372
01:21:49,505 --> 01:21:52,141
Everything's stable now.

1373
01:21:52,175 --> 01:21:54,510
Honey, you just tripped.

1374
01:21:54,543 --> 01:21:56,512
It could've happened
to any of us.

1375
01:21:56,545 --> 01:21:58,414
No.

1376
01:21:58,447 --> 01:21:59,548
It wasn't an accident.

1377
01:21:59,582 --> 01:22:00,549
It pushed me.

1378
01:22:00,583 --> 01:22:02,251
It pushed me down the stairs.

1379
01:22:02,285 --> 01:22:03,519
You have to believe me, please.

1380
01:22:03,552 --> 01:22:04,453
It pushed me.

1381
01:22:04,487 --> 01:22:06,489
I'm gonna go outside.

1382
01:22:06,522 --> 01:22:09,225
I'm gonna let you two be
alone for just a minute.

1383
01:22:09,258 --> 01:22:10,960
(gasping)

1384
01:22:13,096 --> 01:22:14,630
I'm just so glad you're okay.

1385
01:22:24,507 --> 01:22:25,674
You could've hurt the baby.

1386
01:22:25,708 --> 01:22:26,642
Luke it pushed
me down the stairs.

1387
01:22:26,675 --> 01:22:28,544
We're gonna stay at
Meredith's for a while.

1388
01:22:28,577 --> 01:22:29,678
Luke?

1389
01:22:29,712 --> 01:22:31,080
Why are you doing this?

1390
01:22:33,582 --> 01:22:35,584
You think I did this?

1391
01:22:37,086 --> 01:22:38,721
I don't know what I think.

1392
01:22:39,688 --> 01:22:41,524
I fucked up.

1393
01:22:41,557 --> 01:22:43,592
I made a mistake, I

1394
01:22:43,626 --> 01:22:44,427
I should've gotten you real help

1395
01:22:44,460 --> 01:22:45,594
instead of bringing
you down here.

1396
01:22:45,628 --> 01:22:46,662
The house.

1397
01:22:46,695 --> 01:22:48,998
Please, stop.

1398
01:22:49,032 --> 01:22:51,300
Just make it through
this pregnancy.

1399
01:22:51,334 --> 01:22:53,069
For me, that's all I'm asking.

1400
01:22:53,102 --> 01:22:55,038
Make it through this
pregnancy, we could

1401
01:22:56,139 --> 01:22:57,973
we could figure
things out after that.

1402
01:23:01,744 --> 01:23:04,213
I know it's hard.

1403
01:23:04,247 --> 01:23:05,681
But I really think that

1404
01:23:05,714 --> 01:23:07,550
once you'll see the baby
you'll fall in love.

1405
01:23:07,583 --> 01:23:09,552
Everything will make sense.

1406
01:23:09,585 --> 01:23:11,120
You'll see.

1407
01:23:12,221 --> 01:23:14,557
Why don't you care?

1408
01:23:14,590 --> 01:23:17,660
Because this isn't
about you anymore.

1409
01:23:17,693 --> 01:23:19,028
It's about what's
best for this family,

1410
01:23:19,062 --> 01:23:21,230
what's best for us.

1411
01:23:21,264 --> 01:23:23,432
And if you really think you
can get me back to Chicago

1412
01:23:23,466 --> 01:23:27,170
with ghosts and mediums and
falling down the stairs,

1413
01:23:27,203 --> 01:23:29,472
let me just remind you that
you got me out of Chicago,

1414
01:23:29,505 --> 01:23:31,407
when you tried to give
yourself an abortion.

1415
01:23:31,440 --> 01:23:32,275
But I didn't do it.

1416
01:23:32,308 --> 01:23:34,277
But you would have.

1417
01:23:34,310 --> 01:23:35,578
If I hadn't walked
into that room,

1418
01:23:35,611 --> 01:23:37,313
you would have.

1419
01:23:38,714 --> 01:23:40,516
And really, there's not a lot
more in the way of scaring me

1420
01:23:40,549 --> 01:23:42,651
that you can do.

1421
01:23:42,685 --> 01:23:44,420
So just drop it.

1422
01:23:44,453 --> 01:23:45,821
Stop wasting your time and mine

1423
01:23:45,854 --> 01:23:47,790
and start making this work.

1424
01:23:58,101 --> 01:24:00,303
(dark, ominous music)

1425
01:24:15,418 --> 01:24:16,419
The crib?

1426
01:24:16,452 --> 01:24:17,753
It's nothing.

1427
01:24:17,786 --> 01:24:18,521
But she doesn't need.

1428
01:24:18,554 --> 01:24:19,622
Just in case.

1429
01:24:19,655 --> 01:24:21,424
Nothing to worry about.

1430
01:24:22,691 --> 01:24:23,626
We're moving back.

1431
01:24:23,659 --> 01:24:25,228
Just rest.

1432
01:24:38,607 --> 01:24:40,609
(wind rustling)

1433
01:24:42,645 --> 01:24:44,513
(scraping)

1434
01:25:08,904 --> 01:25:10,806
(splashing)

1435
01:25:35,831 --> 01:25:38,133
(whimpering, screaming)

1436
01:25:39,768 --> 01:25:41,804
(clinking)

1437
01:26:03,326 --> 01:26:05,561
(chomping)

1438
01:26:16,472 --> 01:26:17,773
Jenny?

1439
01:26:17,806 --> 01:26:19,642
You should eat your
food, it's getting cold.

1440
01:26:21,944 --> 01:26:23,812
Jenny, you're biting
your nails again.

1441
01:26:28,817 --> 01:26:29,585
Are you feeling?

1442
01:26:29,618 --> 01:26:31,654
She's just tired.

1443
01:26:31,687 --> 01:26:33,356
Drink your tea, sweety.

1444
01:26:50,005 --> 01:26:53,442
So, Luke, when're you
moving into your new office?

1445
01:26:56,712 --> 01:26:57,980
New office?

1446
01:26:58,013 --> 01:26:59,682
For the promotion.

1447
01:26:59,715 --> 01:27:00,949
Promotion?

1448
01:27:00,983 --> 01:27:01,750
Look.

1449
01:27:01,784 --> 01:27:02,951
What promotion?

1450
01:27:02,985 --> 01:27:03,619
I was waiting
for the right time.

1451
01:27:03,652 --> 01:27:04,720
We're leaving.

1452
01:27:04,753 --> 01:27:05,721
Maybe this isn't the
right time to discuss this.

1453
01:27:05,754 --> 01:27:06,655
Aren't we?

1454
01:27:09,925 --> 01:27:11,327
No.

1455
01:27:12,661 --> 01:27:14,397
I told them I'm
staying on, Jenny.

1456
01:27:21,904 --> 01:27:23,306
I like it here.

1457
01:27:23,339 --> 01:27:24,807
I have friends here.

1458
01:27:25,974 --> 01:27:27,743
And you know it's not the
perfect situation for me either

1459
01:27:27,776 --> 01:27:29,412
but I'm making it work.

1460
01:27:31,880 --> 01:27:33,716
I really think we could
have a good life here

1461
01:27:33,749 --> 01:27:34,983
if you just give it a chance.

1462
01:27:35,017 --> 01:27:35,918
You didn't think
this was something

1463
01:27:35,951 --> 01:27:37,653
you should've discussed with me?

1464
01:27:37,686 --> 01:27:38,887
We decided it would be best.

1465
01:27:38,921 --> 01:27:40,789
We?

1466
01:27:40,823 --> 01:27:43,926
Luke and I discussed what
would be best for the baby.

1467
01:27:43,959 --> 01:27:46,295
A stable environment.

1468
01:27:46,329 --> 01:27:47,029
Just for a couple of years.

1469
01:27:47,062 --> 01:27:48,664
Just until things settle down.

1470
01:27:48,697 --> 01:27:49,998
Then we can.

1471
01:27:51,834 --> 01:27:53,302
I'm feeling tired.

1472
01:27:53,336 --> 01:27:53,836
I'm gonna go lie down.

1473
01:27:53,869 --> 01:27:54,570
I'll come.

1474
01:27:54,603 --> 01:27:55,438
No.

1475
01:27:55,471 --> 01:27:56,905
I'll be fine on my own.

1476
01:28:03,879 --> 01:28:04,847
[Voiceover] Hello?

1477
01:28:04,880 --> 01:28:05,648
I'm coming to Chicago.

1478
01:28:05,681 --> 01:28:06,315
[Voiceover] What?

1479
01:28:06,349 --> 01:28:07,049
Jennifer, no.

1480
01:28:07,082 --> 01:28:07,983
You shouldn't be going anywhere,

1481
01:28:08,016 --> 01:28:09,418
I thought that you guys said.

1482
01:28:09,452 --> 01:28:10,018
I'm grabbing a few
things and driving up.

1483
01:28:10,052 --> 01:28:10,953
If you'll have me great

1484
01:28:10,986 --> 01:28:11,954
if not I'll find somewhere else.

1485
01:28:13,722 --> 01:28:15,958
I just called to let you know.

1486
01:28:15,991 --> 01:28:18,293
(birds chirping)

1487
01:28:21,930 --> 01:28:23,332
(thudding)

1488
01:28:44,420 --> 01:28:46,855
(creaking)

1489
01:28:53,896 --> 01:28:55,364
(screaming)

1490
01:28:57,766 --> 01:28:59,368
(buzzing)

1491
01:29:00,769 --> 01:29:01,537
(beep)

1492
01:29:01,570 --> 01:29:02,471
Luke?

1493
01:29:02,505 --> 01:29:03,406
[Voiceover] Where are you?

1494
01:29:03,439 --> 01:29:04,673
It trapped me in the bedroom.

1495
01:29:04,707 --> 01:29:05,608
[Voiceover] God
damn it, Jennifer.

1496
01:29:05,641 --> 01:29:06,409
There's something in the hall.

1497
01:29:06,442 --> 01:29:07,009
I have to get help.

1498
01:29:07,042 --> 01:29:08,377
I have to get help.

1499
01:29:08,411 --> 01:29:09,111
[Voiceover]
Jennifer, calm down

1500
01:29:09,144 --> 01:29:09,978
you have to calm down, okay?

1501
01:29:10,012 --> 01:29:10,646
(groaning)

1502
01:29:10,679 --> 01:29:11,814
Jennifer?

1503
01:29:11,847 --> 01:29:13,449
I think I'm
having contractions.

1504
01:29:13,482 --> 01:29:14,417
[Voiceover] What?

1505
01:29:14,450 --> 01:29:16,452
(panting)

1506
01:29:18,621 --> 01:29:20,022
The baby's coming.

1507
01:29:21,657 --> 01:29:22,925
[Voiceover] Alright,
honey listen, I'm on my way.

1508
01:29:22,958 --> 01:29:25,561
The baby's going
to come, calm down.

1509
01:29:25,594 --> 01:29:27,129
You're going to hurt him
if you're not careful.

1510
01:29:28,797 --> 01:29:30,433
Jennifer you need
to get outside.

1511
01:29:30,466 --> 01:29:31,934
No.

1512
01:29:31,967 --> 01:29:33,402
[Voiceover] Jennifer, please.

1513
01:29:33,436 --> 01:29:34,603
Take a deep breath, okay?

1514
01:29:34,637 --> 01:29:36,104
I'm coming, you
need to get outside.

1515
01:29:37,940 --> 01:29:38,841
I can't.

1516
01:29:38,874 --> 01:29:39,775
(sighing)

1517
01:29:39,808 --> 01:29:40,709
[Voiceover] You can alright?

1518
01:29:40,743 --> 01:29:41,977
There's nothing in the hall.

1519
01:29:42,010 --> 01:29:43,779
Jennifer, there never
has been, alright?

1520
01:29:43,812 --> 01:29:45,648
You're sick, honey.

1521
01:29:45,681 --> 01:29:47,182
Alright I'm sorry.

1522
01:29:47,215 --> 01:29:48,517
Okay, I really am, I'm sorry.

1523
01:29:48,551 --> 01:29:50,653
But this is all in your head.

1524
01:29:50,686 --> 01:29:52,721
Aright, you have to
believe me Jennifer.

1525
01:29:52,755 --> 01:29:54,022
Please.

1526
01:29:55,090 --> 01:29:57,092
Jennifer?

1527
01:29:57,125 --> 01:29:58,393
Okay.

1528
01:29:59,695 --> 01:30:01,530
[Voiceover] Okay.

1529
01:30:01,564 --> 01:30:03,065
Alright, go to the door.

1530
01:30:05,100 --> 01:30:07,035
(panting, snifling)

1531
01:30:14,877 --> 01:30:16,111
I'm there.

1532
01:30:16,144 --> 01:30:17,646
[Voiceover]
Alright, good, good.

1533
01:30:17,680 --> 01:30:19,181
Alright, now close your eyes.

1534
01:30:20,248 --> 01:30:21,984
My eyes are closed.

1535
01:30:22,017 --> 01:30:23,952
[Voiceover] Alright,
great, that's great.

1536
01:30:23,986 --> 01:30:25,120
Alright, now open it.

1537
01:30:25,153 --> 01:30:25,788
Don't.

1538
01:30:25,821 --> 01:30:26,722
(whimpering)

1539
01:30:26,755 --> 01:30:27,523
[Voiceover] Jennifer, you can.

1540
01:30:27,556 --> 01:30:29,057
Alright honey, listen.

1541
01:30:29,091 --> 01:30:29,925
Listen to when I say this,

1542
01:30:29,958 --> 01:30:31,460
there's nothing
out there, alright?

1543
01:30:31,494 --> 01:30:32,194
I promise, there's
nothing there.

1544
01:30:32,227 --> 01:30:33,496
Say it.

1545
01:30:33,529 --> 01:30:34,663
There's nothing there.

1546
01:30:34,697 --> 01:30:35,598
There's nothing there.

1547
01:30:35,631 --> 01:30:36,198
There's nothing there.

1548
01:30:36,231 --> 01:30:37,132
[Voiceover] Okay.

1549
01:30:37,165 --> 01:30:38,934
Alright honey, open the door.

1550
01:30:45,240 --> 01:30:46,809
Alright, open your eyes.

1551
01:30:46,842 --> 01:30:49,111
On the count of three.

1552
01:30:49,144 --> 01:30:50,613
One.

1553
01:30:50,646 --> 01:30:51,780
Two.

1554
01:30:51,814 --> 01:30:52,481
Three.

1555
01:30:52,515 --> 01:30:53,882
(gasping)

1556
01:30:58,053 --> 01:31:00,188
Everything okay?

1557
01:31:00,222 --> 01:31:01,857
Yeah.

1558
01:31:01,890 --> 01:31:03,058
I'm fine.

1559
01:31:03,091 --> 01:31:04,827
[Voiceover]
Anything out there?

1560
01:31:06,228 --> 01:31:07,730
No.

1561
01:31:08,564 --> 01:31:09,832
It's empty.

1562
01:31:09,865 --> 01:31:10,866
[Voiceover] Alright just

1563
01:31:10,899 --> 01:31:12,568
just go downstairs and outside.

1564
01:31:12,601 --> 01:31:13,836
I'll be there soon.

1565
01:31:13,869 --> 01:31:14,870
Okay.

1566
01:31:26,148 --> 01:31:28,684
(dark, menacing music)

1567
01:31:28,717 --> 01:31:30,085
No.

1568
01:31:31,153 --> 01:31:33,088
No.

1569
01:31:33,121 --> 01:31:35,190
(screaming)

1570
01:31:38,160 --> 01:31:39,762
(groaning, whimpering)

1571
01:31:48,937 --> 01:31:50,272
(banging)

1572
01:31:51,339 --> 01:31:54,209
(baby crying, buzzing)

1573
01:32:02,851 --> 01:32:03,786
There's nothing there

1574
01:32:03,819 --> 01:32:04,787
There's nothing there.

1575
01:32:04,820 --> 01:32:05,788
There's nothing there.

1576
01:32:05,821 --> 01:32:06,655
There's nothing there.

1577
01:32:06,689 --> 01:32:07,590
There's nothing there.

1578
01:32:07,623 --> 01:32:08,190
There's nothing.

1579
01:32:08,223 --> 01:32:10,058
There's nothing,

1580
01:32:10,092 --> 01:32:11,594
nothing there.

1581
01:32:17,299 --> 01:32:19,267
(screaming)

1582
01:32:27,910 --> 01:32:31,279
Stop.

1583
01:32:32,881 --> 01:32:34,917
(thudding)

1584
01:32:34,950 --> 01:32:37,019
(panting)

1585
01:33:11,754 --> 01:33:14,189
(breathing soundly)

1586
01:33:46,088 --> 01:33:48,356
(light, melodious music)

1587
01:34:05,407 --> 01:34:07,142
You wanna show him his room?

1588
01:34:08,944 --> 01:34:10,245
Sure.

1589
01:35:15,443 --> 01:35:16,278
(creaking)

1590
01:35:16,311 --> 01:35:17,712
(gasping)

1591
01:35:52,981 --> 01:35:54,482
Jennifer.

1592
01:35:56,919 --> 01:35:58,120
Pardon my mess.

1593
01:35:58,153 --> 01:36:01,056
I'm not accustomed to
having much company.

1594
01:36:10,365 --> 01:36:12,935
I'm sorry for how I acted.

1595
01:36:12,968 --> 01:36:13,501
For what I said.

1596
01:36:13,535 --> 01:36:14,970
Please.

1597
01:36:15,003 --> 01:36:17,172
We're both adults, no
need for pleasantries.

1598
01:36:18,373 --> 01:36:19,875
What can I do for you?

1599
01:36:22,010 --> 01:36:23,211
Luke and my mom are telling me

1600
01:36:23,245 --> 01:36:26,348
that the pregnancy
was too much for me.

1601
01:36:26,381 --> 01:36:29,284
At this point, I'm
willing to accept that.

1602
01:36:29,317 --> 01:36:31,920
But they're just a few things
that keep nagging at me.

1603
01:36:34,322 --> 01:36:36,258
You saw something.

1604
01:36:36,291 --> 01:36:37,259
Didn't you?

1605
01:36:37,292 --> 01:36:38,093
Right be fore you left.

1606
01:36:38,126 --> 01:36:39,361
No.

1607
01:36:40,395 --> 01:36:41,496
I saw your face.

1608
01:36:41,529 --> 01:36:42,931
No.

1609
01:36:42,965 --> 01:36:45,467
I didn't see anything.

1610
01:36:46,902 --> 01:36:49,204
Something started to make
sense to me that's all.

1611
01:36:50,138 --> 01:36:51,539
What?

1612
01:36:54,042 --> 01:36:55,577
I don't believe
in God, Jennifer.

1613
01:36:55,610 --> 01:36:58,881
I don't believe in
life after death.

1614
01:37:00,048 --> 01:37:02,985
And if you pressed me,
I'd have to admit I

1615
01:37:03,018 --> 01:37:05,420
don't believe in ghosts either.

1616
01:37:05,453 --> 01:37:07,956
At least not the way they're
generally understood.

1617
01:37:09,524 --> 01:37:12,560
Stopped believing
all of that after

1618
01:37:12,594 --> 01:37:14,396
Charlie died.

1619
01:37:14,429 --> 01:37:16,131
'Cause I knew that if
there was an afterlife,

1620
01:37:16,164 --> 01:37:18,901
if there was any way possible,

1621
01:37:18,934 --> 01:37:20,468
he would contact me.

1622
01:37:21,669 --> 01:37:23,605
And he didn't.

1623
01:37:23,638 --> 01:37:26,408
He hasn't, not once
in over 20 years.

1624
01:37:27,375 --> 01:37:28,911
And how I tried.

1625
01:37:36,484 --> 01:37:38,186
But you said you pick up on.

1626
01:37:38,220 --> 01:37:39,221
Energies.

1627
01:37:39,254 --> 01:37:40,588
Yes.

1628
01:37:40,622 --> 01:37:42,624
But just that.

1629
01:37:45,327 --> 01:37:48,596
It's a lot less romantic
than ghosts, isn't it?

1630
01:37:48,630 --> 01:37:52,067
It's a lot less comforting too.

1631
01:37:53,201 --> 01:37:55,603
But that's all I was
ever able to pick up on.

1632
01:37:56,571 --> 01:37:59,441
I don't think there
is anything else.

1633
01:37:59,474 --> 01:38:01,643
Well if you don't think it
was a ghost then what was it?

1634
01:38:01,676 --> 01:38:02,577
You

1635
01:38:02,610 --> 01:38:05,047
have an energy, Jennifer.

1636
01:38:05,080 --> 01:38:07,015
I'm picking up on it right now.

1637
01:38:07,049 --> 01:38:09,617
You're afraid, frustrated.

1638
01:38:09,651 --> 01:38:11,219
I feel that.

1639
01:38:11,253 --> 01:38:13,621
And whether you're
aware of it or not,

1640
01:38:13,655 --> 01:38:15,490
it's bumping up
against my energy.

1641
01:38:15,523 --> 01:38:17,659
It's physically affecting
me, energy does that.

1642
01:38:19,127 --> 01:38:22,931
Well places, have
energies too, Jennifer.

1643
01:38:22,965 --> 01:38:24,532
Houses even.

1644
01:38:24,566 --> 01:38:27,035
And they're affected
in just the same way.

1645
01:38:28,336 --> 01:38:30,372
Let's say you go
into a place that

1646
01:38:31,539 --> 01:38:34,142
has a lot of energy
hanging around it.

1647
01:38:35,077 --> 01:38:36,678
Your house, say.

1648
01:38:36,711 --> 01:38:39,214
If you go into a place like that

1649
01:38:39,247 --> 01:38:41,249
and you're going
through something,

1650
01:38:41,283 --> 01:38:45,954
stress, anger, lot of
sorrow, regret, anything.

1651
01:38:47,122 --> 01:38:50,092
Well all that energy
you're pouring out

1652
01:38:50,125 --> 01:38:53,495
is going to bump up against the
energy that's already there.

1653
01:38:53,528 --> 01:38:55,297
It's gonna rough it up, you see.

1654
01:38:55,330 --> 01:38:57,365
Mess with it.

1655
01:38:57,399 --> 01:38:59,067
And then,

1656
01:38:59,101 --> 01:39:02,504
that energy that was
there is going to change.

1657
01:39:02,537 --> 01:39:04,239
It's going to react.

1658
01:39:06,674 --> 01:39:08,243
I'm not saying that's exactly

1659
01:39:08,276 --> 01:39:10,045
what's happening in your house.

1660
01:39:11,179 --> 01:39:12,514
But I am saying
that we often forget

1661
01:39:12,547 --> 01:39:16,284
that we're constantly
affecting everything around us.

1662
01:39:16,318 --> 01:39:19,121
People, environments,

1663
01:39:20,188 --> 01:39:22,490
old houses in Kansas.

1664
01:39:24,592 --> 01:39:26,494
You're saying,

1665
01:39:29,231 --> 01:39:30,598
you think this was all my fault.

1666
01:39:30,632 --> 01:39:32,467
You wanted my
opinion, there it is.

1667
01:39:32,500 --> 01:39:33,668
There's got to be
another explanation.

1668
01:39:33,701 --> 01:39:35,070
There's,

1669
01:39:35,103 --> 01:39:36,138
there's something else,
I won't except that.

1670
01:39:36,171 --> 01:39:37,572
Of course not.

1671
01:39:37,605 --> 01:39:39,607
You're too blinded by
your search to find

1672
01:39:39,641 --> 01:39:42,577
something or someone else
to blame, aren't you?

1673
01:39:42,610 --> 01:39:45,147
Well there are things much
bigger than us, Jennifer.

1674
01:39:45,180 --> 01:39:47,549
Things that aren't so
easily categorized or

1675
01:39:47,582 --> 01:39:49,551
or controlled.

1676
01:39:49,584 --> 01:39:51,419
You might have
better luck if you

1677
01:39:51,453 --> 01:39:52,787
stopped trying to
push everything

1678
01:39:52,820 --> 01:39:54,256
the way you want it to go

1679
01:39:54,289 --> 01:39:56,691
and started looking
at the source.

1680
01:39:59,127 --> 01:40:00,695
You don't know
anything about me.

1681
01:40:00,728 --> 01:40:03,065
Oh, but I do, my dear.

1682
01:40:05,100 --> 01:40:08,136
You moved into that
house and you hated it.

1683
01:40:08,803 --> 01:40:10,205
You hated this town,

1684
01:40:10,238 --> 01:40:11,706
you hated your mother.

1685
01:40:11,739 --> 01:40:13,375
You hated your husband
for bringing you here.

1686
01:40:13,408 --> 01:40:15,110
And most of all,

1687
01:40:15,143 --> 01:40:17,412
you hated that baby inside you

1688
01:40:17,445 --> 01:40:19,481
and what it did to
your perfect life.

1689
01:40:20,615 --> 01:40:22,250
From all I can see,

1690
01:40:22,284 --> 01:40:24,252
you've done nothing but hate.

1691
01:40:25,287 --> 01:40:27,155
Are you really
surprised that the house

1692
01:40:27,189 --> 01:40:30,125
started to hate back?

1693
01:40:30,158 --> 01:40:31,393
I shouldn't have come to you.

1694
01:40:31,426 --> 01:40:32,627
I should've known
you wouldn't help.

1695
01:40:32,660 --> 01:40:34,429
What're you even doing here?

1696
01:40:34,462 --> 01:40:36,598
Still in this town?

1697
01:40:36,631 --> 01:40:38,133
Now that everything is settled,

1698
01:40:38,166 --> 01:40:40,235
now that the baby is born,

1699
01:40:40,268 --> 01:40:41,169
I don't understand,

1700
01:40:41,203 --> 01:40:42,737
why don't you just leave?

1701
01:40:46,541 --> 01:40:49,177
[Jennifer] Believe
me that's all I want.

1702
01:40:50,612 --> 01:40:52,614
Then what's stopping you?

1703
01:40:58,820 --> 01:41:00,722
(creaking)

1704
01:41:12,800 --> 01:41:14,469
(thudding)

1705
01:41:16,604 --> 01:41:17,772
Hello?

1706
01:41:21,609 --> 01:41:23,178
Jennifer?

1707
01:41:57,612 --> 01:41:58,880
(buzzing)

1708
01:42:04,852 --> 01:42:05,753
Hey.

1709
01:42:05,787 --> 01:42:08,122
(frequency disturbance)

1710
01:42:18,900 --> 01:42:20,402
Luke.

1711
01:42:21,536 --> 01:42:23,671
(baby crying)

1712
01:42:26,774 --> 01:42:27,942
Luke?

1713
01:42:27,975 --> 01:42:29,477
Luke?

1714
01:42:31,546 --> 01:42:32,680
Luke?

1715
01:42:37,819 --> 01:42:39,554
Luke?

1716
01:42:39,587 --> 01:42:40,755
Luke?

1717
01:42:43,758 --> 01:42:46,528
(dark, menacing music)

1718
01:44:12,013 --> 01:44:14,849
(car rumbling)

1719
01:44:28,663 --> 01:44:31,032
(whimpering)

1720
01:44:46,514 --> 01:44:48,616
Grandma's gonna
miss you so much.

1721
01:44:56,491 --> 01:44:58,626
Are you sure this is
the right thing to do?

1722
01:45:00,061 --> 01:45:01,996
If you live closer I could
help you take care of Tyler.

1723
01:45:04,098 --> 01:45:05,733
Take care of you.

1724
01:45:11,773 --> 01:45:13,875
Plan was always to
go back to Chicago.

1725
01:45:16,744 --> 01:45:17,979
Your plan.

1726
01:45:20,081 --> 01:45:22,950
Well, I'm happy for you.

1727
01:45:25,052 --> 01:45:27,054
At least you're getting
what you wanted.

1728
01:45:55,082 --> 01:45:57,719
(engine revving)

1729
01:46:37,124 --> 01:46:39,927
(baby crying)

1730
01:48:20,194 --> 01:48:20,261
(enigmatic, melodious music)
