1
00:01:33,394 --> 00:01:35,827
Okay, thanks.

2
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:47,841
This stuff sucks.

3
00:01:48,641 --> 00:01:52,580
All right, kid, you want
to see top-shelf quality?

4
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,282
I'm gonna show you my
own personal line, okay?

5
00:01:55,382 --> 00:01:57,918
This is between you and me.
I'm still in the copyrighting stage.

6
00:01:58,018 --> 00:02:01,453
What I'm about to show
you is for your eyes only.

7
00:02:03,489 --> 00:02:06,293
Doghouse series.
This is doghouse Reilly.

8
00:02:06,393 --> 00:02:09,630
Age: Unknown; Eye color: Cobalt;

9
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:13,634
Hair: Forest Gold;
Build: Smoker's Athletic;

10
00:02:13,734 --> 00:02:17,838
Occupation: Trillionaire Detective.

11
00:02:17,938 --> 00:02:19,172
Sounds lame.

12
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:24,378
You're lame, kid. Doghouse would punch
out your whole family for that remark.

13
00:02:25,078 --> 00:02:26,845
Is that cat for sale?

14
00:02:30,782 --> 00:02:34,655
- Is that a real question?
- He's on the table.

15
00:02:34,755 --> 00:02:37,625
So is your hand. Are you for sale?

16
00:02:37,725 --> 00:02:41,935
No, you're not. So please remove
it and yourself from my lawn.

17
00:02:42,036 --> 00:02:44,565
- Loser.
- Doll-kisser.

18
00:02:45,965 --> 00:02:49,458
Clinton, what did you say to that boy?

19
00:02:49,859 --> 00:02:52,772
Just a business disagreement. Ma...

20
00:02:53,472 --> 00:02:55,075
Ma, we're gonna be late.

21
00:02:55,975 --> 00:02:59,547
You're seeing this, right?
This is exactly what I'm talking about.

22
00:02:59,647 --> 00:03:04,785
This is not normal. He's not himself anymore.
He's sleeping all the time. He's eating less.

23
00:03:04,885 --> 00:03:10,457
He just stares blankly off into space.
He's been disappearing for days at a time.

24
00:03:10,557 --> 00:03:13,131
And look at his hair.
Something's wrong with his hair.

25
00:03:13,232 --> 00:03:14,628
It looks like it's falling out.

26
00:03:15,128 --> 00:03:18,432
I think for a 17-year-old cat,
he appears quite healthy.

27
00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:20,367
- Can I talk to you for a minute?
- Sure.

28
00:03:20,467 --> 00:03:21,767
Just...

29
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:27,074
The truth is, doc,
things haven't been so good lately.

30
00:03:27,174 --> 00:03:32,746
Nothing makes him happy anymore.
It's like his will and spirit are gone.

31
00:03:32,846 --> 00:03:34,748
- You know I'm a veterinarian.
- Right.

32
00:03:34,848 --> 00:03:37,482
I think you should
consult a psychiatrist.

33
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:41,755
They have those for cats now?

34
00:03:41,855 --> 00:03:47,127
Okay, ma, we've got to make an
appointment with Dr. Soane in Petaluma.

35
00:03:47,627 --> 00:03:50,397
This is why you've got
to get your license, hon.

36
00:03:50,497 --> 00:03:52,800
I'm talking about Mouser's well-being,

37
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:58,372
and you're bugging me about a
driver's license. It's unbelievable, ma.

38
00:03:58,472 --> 00:04:00,874
- What are you doing?
- I need a few things.

39
00:04:00,974 --> 00:04:03,510
We're just gonna stop at
Ford's Megastore for a minute.

40
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:06,347
You know very well it's against
everything I stand for.

41
00:04:06,447 --> 00:04:09,350
Not this time. I really don't care...

42
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:13,487
He killed my business, ma. Now I'm stuck
running a yard sale like a common clown.

43
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:18,425
You had a corner comics store that lasted
six months. You didn't even make a cent.

44
00:04:18,525 --> 00:04:21,595
What does Ford's Megastore
have to do with anything?

45
00:04:22,295 --> 00:04:24,996
This coming from my number-one investor.

46
00:04:27,233 --> 00:04:29,233
You've changed, ma.

47
00:04:31,638 --> 00:04:33,774
<i>I said that you were...</i>

48
00:04:33,874 --> 00:04:35,406
<i>Okay.</i>

49
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:45,619
Hey, honey, I'm off.

50
00:04:46,219 --> 00:04:48,922
Mac and cheese is in the fridge.

51
00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:51,490
Okay, thanks, mom.

52
00:04:53,392 --> 00:04:56,930
- Do you smell gasoline?
- That's perfume, Clinton.

53
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:01,362
What's that? Lipstick?
You're not going on a date, are you?

54
00:05:01,463 --> 00:05:05,405
What, I can't dress up?
Not that it's any of your business.

55
00:05:05,505 --> 00:05:08,557
I'm just trying to protect you from
the douche bags you seem to attract.

56
00:05:08,658 --> 00:05:12,913
- "The douche bags"?
- Scumbags, dirtbags... All the bags.

57
00:05:13,013 --> 00:05:15,580
As you know, I haven't
had a date in years.

58
00:05:17,617 --> 00:05:20,388
That's hilarious. What...

59
00:05:21,188 --> 00:05:23,690
What? No, not you, mom, the show.

60
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:27,058
I was laughing at the show. Tony Danza.

61
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:33,600
<i>Hi, everybody. I'm Al Ford. Come on down
to the Megastore, where you steal from us.</i>

62
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:36,463
<i>Home barbecues... we're on fire.</i>

63
00:05:36,564 --> 00:05:39,139
<i>Sporting goods... you betcha.</i>

64
00:05:39,939 --> 00:05:42,810
<i>Toys for kids? Dude!</i>

65
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:47,278
<i>So come on down to Ford's Megastore,
where you steal from us.</i>

66
00:05:53,153 --> 00:05:57,222
Hey, buddy.
Can you believe that asshole?

67
00:05:58,724 --> 00:06:01,528
What are you doing? Hey, buddy.

68
00:06:02,428 --> 00:06:04,765
What are you doing?

69
00:06:04,965 --> 00:06:09,000
What are you always
doing up here? Come here.

70
00:06:14,307 --> 00:06:19,713
What's going on with you?
I'm worried about you.

71
00:06:19,813 --> 00:06:22,614
Mundhra says you need a shrink.

72
00:06:28,821 --> 00:06:30,855
Hey, buddy.

73
00:07:04,523 --> 00:07:06,625
Mouser?

74
00:07:30,081 --> 00:07:31,850
What the hell?

75
00:07:37,323 --> 00:07:39,724
Oh, are you kidding me?

76
00:07:41,728 --> 00:07:45,165
Come on. God. Ma...

77
00:07:45,365 --> 00:07:47,434
Ma, what happened?

78
00:07:47,934 --> 00:07:49,968
I'm so sorry, honey.

79
00:07:52,804 --> 00:07:54,305
Ma...

80
00:07:58,177 --> 00:08:00,879
What's going on? Hey, hey, hey.

81
00:08:02,581 --> 00:08:03,784
Mouser?

82
00:08:04,184 --> 00:08:06,818
Mouser! What... what happened?

83
00:08:11,123 --> 00:08:13,961
What happened? What happened?

84
00:08:14,061 --> 00:08:17,297
Did anyone see what happened?

85
00:08:17,397 --> 00:08:19,833
No one saw anything?

86
00:08:19,933 --> 00:08:23,935
Just step back. Step back.
Give him room to breathe.

87
00:08:25,237 --> 00:08:27,874
Oh, no, mom!

88
00:08:27,974 --> 00:08:31,945
Ma... Mom, what...

89
00:08:32,045 --> 00:08:34,648
Mouser.

90
00:08:34,748 --> 00:08:36,915
Mouser, boy.

91
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:54,901
I've been here all night. I can't tell...
I can't believe none of these people

92
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:58,405
called you guys sooner, not to mention,
you could've arrived here sooner,

93
00:08:58,505 --> 00:09:00,674
but you should probably question
some of these neighbors.

94
00:09:00,774 --> 00:09:03,243
I think when Molly at
dispatch got the call,

95
00:09:03,343 --> 00:09:07,047
there was at first an assumption
that it was a prank call.

96
00:09:07,147 --> 00:09:09,747
Sir, why don't we step over here?

97
00:09:12,752 --> 00:09:17,691
Can you tell me about last night?
What did you do, what did you see?

98
00:09:18,491 --> 00:09:20,694
Yeah, yeah. I...

99
00:09:20,794 --> 00:09:23,830
I watched four episodes
of <i>Who's The Boss?</i>

100
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:26,233
No, five, ac... Five.

101
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:29,768
I ate dinner...
macaroni and cheese, kraft.

102
00:09:31,538 --> 00:09:35,039
Did you see or hear anything?

103
00:09:36,508 --> 00:09:38,412
No, no.

104
00:09:38,512 --> 00:09:41,815
Any enemies that you know of
or recent threats of any kind?

105
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:44,849
No, no. Mouser was very well liked.

106
00:09:47,186 --> 00:09:48,889
I meant you.

107
00:09:49,489 --> 00:09:52,290
Oh. No. None whatsoever.

108
00:09:54,026 --> 00:09:56,163
Okay.

109
00:09:56,563 --> 00:09:58,031
Thank you.

110
00:09:58,131 --> 00:10:00,100
What-what, that's it?

111
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:03,737
Well, I'll file a report,
and we'll hope for the best.

112
00:10:03,837 --> 00:10:05,338
"Hope for the best"?

113
00:10:06,038 --> 00:10:10,210
- There's an arrow sticking out of my cat.
- I'm sorry, sir.

114
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:13,080
Aren't you going to take
some crime-scene photos?

115
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:16,750
Take some DNA samples?
Where are the lab guys?

116
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:20,387
- All right, let's just take it easy, bud.
- My cat was clearly murdered,

117
00:10:20,487 --> 00:10:25,089
so, no, I will not "take it easy, bud."

118
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:30,895
You... Mom, wh...

119
00:10:32,564 --> 00:10:36,169
Excuse me, sir. Can we
have a few words with you?

120
00:10:36,269 --> 00:10:39,670
We're with the local news.
Is there something you'd like to say?

121
00:10:42,943 --> 00:10:44,845
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

122
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:51,018
My best friend was murdered today,
and I demand justice!

123
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:53,584
End quote.

124
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,998
Clinton?

125
00:11:43,669 --> 00:11:45,403
Clinton?

126
00:11:50,976 --> 00:11:52,810
Clinton?

127
00:11:55,915 --> 00:11:57,448
Not again.

128
00:11:59,418 --> 00:12:02,055
Clinton, will you please
come down from there?

129
00:12:02,355 --> 00:12:03,857
I'm having a vigil.

130
00:12:03,957 --> 00:12:07,127
- A vigil?
- Yes. A candlelight vigil.

131
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:12,663
Couldn't you have it inside?
Or maybe just at a safer height?

132
00:12:14,466 --> 00:12:17,101
Side socket by the window, please.

133
00:12:25,311 --> 00:12:27,547
Okay, will you come down now?

134
00:12:28,447 --> 00:12:30,014
Clinton!

135
00:12:51,038 --> 00:12:53,573
Shut that shit off!

136
00:13:08,754 --> 00:13:12,223
Oh. Did you sleep on the roof again?

137
00:13:20,265 --> 00:13:22,669
- What is that?
- Oh, it's nothing.

138
00:13:23,069 --> 00:13:25,071
Well, why are you hiding it?

139
00:13:25,171 --> 00:13:27,974
I'm not. It's nothing.
I just haven't finished reading it yet.

140
00:13:28,074 --> 00:13:29,943
Let me see it. Ma?

141
00:13:30,043 --> 00:13:32,178
- Honey!
- Let me have it! I saw my face!

142
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:34,612
Oh, for heaven's sake.

143
00:13:38,383 --> 00:13:41,388
They called me "a harmless oddball"?

144
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:43,990
Honey, I think that it was
meant to be endearing.

145
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:48,161
They say Mouser was last seen
when I was "staging a garage sale"?

146
00:13:48,261 --> 00:13:52,365
I wasn't staging anything.
It was an actual goddamn garage sale.

147
00:13:52,465 --> 00:13:56,896
And he wasn't "found dead,"
he was murdered! This is bullshit!

148
00:13:56,997 --> 00:13:59,973
- Nobody cares!
- Well, Frank cares.

149
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:03,808
- Who the hell is Frank?
- Sheriff Hoyle.

150
00:14:14,053 --> 00:14:15,353
Oh, come on.

151
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:25,132
Store's closed indefinitely, kid.
I got other business to attend to.

152
00:14:26,032 --> 00:14:30,468
- What do you want, kid?
- Your cat... I saw him.

153
00:14:37,275 --> 00:14:39,345
What do you know?

154
00:14:39,445 --> 00:14:43,750
- Twenty.
- Twenty? Twenty... Twenty what?

155
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:46,119
- What is this 20?
- Bucks.

156
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:49,756
Oh, come... I'm not giving you
20 bucks, you little weasel.

157
00:14:50,256 --> 00:14:52,823
Hey! Wait, wait, wait. Okay. Okay.

158
00:14:54,626 --> 00:14:59,299
I got... $10.36. Okay, now you want it.

159
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:01,298
Follow me.

160
00:15:07,506 --> 00:15:09,173
Hey.

161
00:15:12,144 --> 00:15:14,311
Trevor, goddamn it!

162
00:15:25,491 --> 00:15:28,361
Here. Here.

163
00:15:29,061 --> 00:15:31,932
- "Here" what?
- I saw him.

164
00:15:32,832 --> 00:15:35,466
Dragging himself with the arrow
sticking out of him and all.

165
00:15:46,711 --> 00:15:50,917
- Why didn't you help him?
- I didn't know what to do.

166
00:15:51,017 --> 00:15:55,719
You don't see that every day...
a cat with an arrow out of it.

167
00:15:58,223 --> 00:16:00,527
Wait. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Where are you going?

168
00:16:00,627 --> 00:16:03,029
I've got to go to the
pool with my brother.

169
00:16:03,329 --> 00:16:08,199
Yeah, you... You go synchronized
swim while I solve a murder!

170
00:17:04,856 --> 00:17:08,596
What the... Mouser. Mouser.

171
00:17:09,696 --> 00:17:13,633
I answer to "Horatio"? What the...

172
00:17:13,733 --> 00:17:18,336
"172 Hope's Crest."
Hope's Crest... Hope's Crest...

173
00:17:47,766 --> 00:17:49,436
Hello?

174
00:17:50,536 --> 00:17:52,305
Hello?

175
00:17:52,805 --> 00:17:54,705
Hello?

176
00:17:55,707 --> 00:17:57,975
Hello?

177
00:18:41,219 --> 00:18:42,653
Mouser.

178
00:19:32,636 --> 00:19:34,238
Horatio?

179
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:40,578
Hor... Horatio?

180
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:47,720
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!

181
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:49,989
What the hell are you doing
in my closet, you pervert?

182
00:19:50,089 --> 00:19:53,760
- Were you jerking off in there?
- No, no! Good God, no!

183
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:55,329
- I'm calling the police.
- Wait.

184
00:19:55,429 --> 00:19:58,268
Don't move. I will whack
your balls with my flute.

185
00:19:58,369 --> 00:20:01,501
Geez! No! I didn't break in, okay?
The door was open.

186
00:20:01,601 --> 00:20:04,070
So you just pranced right in, you freak?

187
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:06,036
- I am not some kind...
- Hey, hey!

188
00:20:08,174 --> 00:20:11,787
- What is that? Is that my flyer?
- Yes! Yes!

189
00:20:11,888 --> 00:20:14,508
And I want to know why
there's a picture of my cat on it,

190
00:20:14,609 --> 00:20:17,509
not to mention all over your walls!

191
00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:20,987
- What?
- You sick... No, just skip it.

192
00:20:21,087 --> 00:20:23,756
Skip it. I know what you did.

193
00:20:23,856 --> 00:20:26,693
Why don't you put some clothes on,
'cause I'm calling the police.

194
00:20:26,793 --> 00:20:29,729
- I'm calling the police! Don't move!
- Give me the phone!

195
00:20:29,829 --> 00:20:31,564
- You stay back.
- Give me your phone!

196
00:20:31,664 --> 00:20:35,028
Yeah, there's an intruder in
my home, a sexual predator.

197
00:20:35,129 --> 00:20:36,857
No, there's a murderer here!

198
00:20:36,958 --> 00:20:41,574
- You're gonna pay for this, you pet-napper.
- He was jerking off in there while I... hey!

199
00:20:41,674 --> 00:20:42,967
What the...

200
00:20:43,068 --> 00:20:44,377
Jesus!

201
00:20:44,477 --> 00:20:46,479
Yeah, get out of here!

202
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:50,116
Okay, just get here as soon as you can.
Yeah, I'm armed.

203
00:20:51,216 --> 00:20:54,452
Hey, Morgan. Come on.
You kids know better than that.

204
00:20:58,456 --> 00:21:00,084
Out of the way!

205
00:21:00,185 --> 00:21:03,463
- Hey, Clinton, will you...
- Stop the car! Police business!

206
00:21:03,563 --> 00:21:05,529
Get out of the street!

207
00:21:07,565 --> 00:21:09,800
I found the killer.

208
00:21:17,509 --> 00:21:19,512
You're absolutely sure about this?

209
00:21:19,612 --> 00:21:23,047
Yes, I'm sure. She struck
me with a lead pipe. Look.

210
00:21:25,416 --> 00:21:28,721
Was there a mark there, or...
I don't see anything.

211
00:21:28,821 --> 00:21:31,488
Just let me do the talking, okay?

212
00:21:34,759 --> 00:21:36,227
Calm down.

213
00:21:38,696 --> 00:21:40,800
Okay, don't let her get in your head.

214
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:44,003
- Finally you show up.
- Excuse me?

215
00:21:44,103 --> 00:21:47,840
- Wait, that's the guy.
- Cuff her, Hoyle. She's got a weapon.

216
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:50,176
All right, what is going
on here with you two?

217
00:21:50,276 --> 00:21:56,149
This perv broke into my house, watched me
change, and then masturbated on my clothes.

218
00:21:56,249 --> 00:22:00,686
What the... no. I was looking for evidence.
There was no masturbation.

219
00:22:00,786 --> 00:22:03,656
- Why do you keep s... you pervert!
- You broke in?

220
00:22:03,756 --> 00:22:06,711
No, the door was unlocked.
That's not important.

221
00:22:06,812 --> 00:22:08,694
She's a murderer. She killed Mouser.

222
00:22:08,794 --> 00:22:12,064
What the hell are you talking about?
I didn't kill any mice.

223
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:14,700
The proof is on the walls. Look.

224
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:17,703
Look, right there, she lured
Mouser in with her cheap bribes

225
00:22:17,803 --> 00:22:20,506
and her fancy cat food and
then pulled the trigger.

226
00:22:20,606 --> 00:22:23,209
Or... the bow.
His picture's right there!

227
00:22:23,309 --> 00:22:26,078
That's Horatio, my cat.

228
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:32,249
- Ma'am, is your cat here right now?
- Yeah! Yeah, smart. Where is Horatio?

229
00:22:34,585 --> 00:22:37,890
No. He's been missing for, like, a week,

230
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:41,794
- but he disappears from time to time, so...
- Oh, bullshit!

231
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:43,596
You...

232
00:22:43,696 --> 00:22:46,165
I think I know what's
going on here, okay?

233
00:22:46,265 --> 00:22:50,438
You two owned the same cat.
He was moonlighting.

234
00:22:52,938 --> 00:22:55,740
- What... what do you mean, "owned"?
- But that's impossible.

235
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:57,676
Past tense?

236
00:22:58,176 --> 00:23:01,616
I'm sorry to have to tell
you this, ma'am, but...

237
00:23:01,717 --> 00:23:06,953
Horatio-slash-Mouser
was found dead yesterday.

238
00:23:07,053 --> 00:23:10,556
Ma'am, I know this is a
difficult moment, but...

239
00:23:10,656 --> 00:23:13,190
would you mind if I take a quick
look around the apartment?

240
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:20,166
- No.
- Thank you.

241
00:23:20,666 --> 00:23:22,668
Clinton, wait in the car.

242
00:23:22,768 --> 00:23:24,968
- I'm here if you need me.
- Wait in the car.

243
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:33,846
So let me get this straight, you're not gonna
do one thing then? I mean, not a damn thing?

244
00:23:33,946 --> 00:23:36,582
How did you even get that badge, man?
You're a quitter.

245
00:23:36,682 --> 00:23:39,752
Okay, first of all, there is not
a shred of actual evidence

246
00:23:39,852 --> 00:23:42,288
that that girl had anything
to do with this crime, Clinton.

247
00:23:42,388 --> 00:23:46,559
Second of all, this is
a police matter, okay?

248
00:23:46,659 --> 00:23:49,759
For police personnel.

249
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:54,097
What are you trying to tell me?

250
00:23:58,236 --> 00:24:02,942
Look, I'm gonna turn a blind eye to the
whole breaking-and-entering fiasco,

251
00:24:03,042 --> 00:24:06,946
but you've got to stop.
No more detective games, okay?

252
00:24:07,046 --> 00:24:11,251
I mean, we're talking about a cat, right?
It's not the Lindbergh baby.

253
00:24:12,651 --> 00:24:15,419
That cat was my best friend.

254
00:24:37,709 --> 00:24:39,612
Hey, asshole.

255
00:24:39,712 --> 00:24:41,781
What are you doing here?
How did you find my house?

256
00:24:41,881 --> 00:24:44,016
I looked up "dick hole"
in the white pages.

257
00:24:44,116 --> 00:24:46,986
Whoa, hey, don't you try anything.
My mom is inside.

258
00:24:47,086 --> 00:24:50,256
God, you're a real pussy when you
don't have a cop to hide behind.

259
00:24:50,356 --> 00:24:51,825
Why'd you do it?

260
00:24:53,025 --> 00:24:55,595
Will you stop with that?

261
00:24:55,895 --> 00:24:58,629
- Show me my cat.
- No, no, no, no. Not a chance.

262
00:25:22,553 --> 00:25:25,354
What are you doing? Just...

263
00:25:35,167 --> 00:25:37,634
Hey! What the hell's wrong with you?

264
00:25:51,983 --> 00:25:53,884
Horatio...

265
00:26:01,192 --> 00:26:03,527
"Mouser," right?

266
00:26:05,296 --> 00:26:06,997
Yep.

267
00:26:09,968 --> 00:26:11,935
This is nice,

268
00:26:13,438 --> 00:26:15,705
this burial here.

269
00:26:16,374 --> 00:26:18,175
Thank you.

270
00:26:19,878 --> 00:26:23,647
This... this was his favorite tree.

271
00:26:29,754 --> 00:26:31,891
Is this supposed to be Horatio?

272
00:26:32,891 --> 00:26:34,460
Smoking a cigarette?

273
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:40,066
That is a work in progress.
No one's supposed to see this, okay?

274
00:26:40,166 --> 00:26:42,268
The cigarette can come out, by the way.

275
00:26:42,368 --> 00:26:47,207
It just depends on which version you buy...
adult or children. I have a toy line.

276
00:26:48,207 --> 00:26:49,641
You have a toy line?

277
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:54,113
Well, technically "lines" delineated
by different worlds and characters.

278
00:26:54,213 --> 00:26:56,749
Can we just stay on task?

279
00:26:57,549 --> 00:27:01,885
This is the murder weapon. Be very careful.
You should be wearing gloves.

280
00:27:07,891 --> 00:27:12,329
There's bite marks.
He was trying to pull it out.

281
00:27:14,999 --> 00:27:17,369
Who would do something like this?

282
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:23,407
I don't know, but I'm starting to think
it was some kind of crazed apache.

283
00:27:27,378 --> 00:27:31,617
- They sell these at Ford's.
- Ford's Megastore?

284
00:27:31,917 --> 00:27:35,287
Yeah. I used to be an
assistant manager there.

285
00:27:35,887 --> 00:27:40,357
- They have a whole archery section.
- Please. I can't hear any more.

286
00:27:43,194 --> 00:27:46,463
I never thought I'd have
to set foot in that store.

287
00:27:48,266 --> 00:27:49,967
Let's roll.

288
00:27:51,636 --> 00:27:56,073
Oh, do you have a car or just a way to
get there? Otherwise, I should ask my mom.

289
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:06,718
Is this thing road-safe?

290
00:28:06,818 --> 00:28:08,886
So you live with your mom?

291
00:28:10,588 --> 00:28:12,224
God! That's brutal.

292
00:28:12,324 --> 00:28:15,027
It's actually a business decision,
if you must know.

293
00:28:15,127 --> 00:28:17,797
I run a small enterprise out of my home.

294
00:28:17,897 --> 00:28:21,867
My mother is an investor and the C.F.O.

295
00:28:21,967 --> 00:28:25,004
It's a live-work space.
My bedroom is also an office

296
00:28:25,104 --> 00:28:26,939
- and an efficient repair shop.
- Jesus.

297
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:30,242
By the way, you're one to talk.
You live with a bunch of geriatrics.

298
00:28:30,342 --> 00:28:33,879
I get a really good deal on rent in
exchange for cutting everyone's hair.

299
00:28:33,979 --> 00:28:37,814
And anyway, I like old people.
They're nice. They're peaceful.

300
00:28:56,968 --> 00:29:00,339
- What's wrong with you?
- Nothing.

301
00:29:00,439 --> 00:29:02,872
I just haven't been here since I quit.

302
00:29:04,142 --> 00:29:05,642
Come on.

303
00:29:09,614 --> 00:29:12,151
Greta Chuplinski.

304
00:29:12,251 --> 00:29:15,554
Back from retirement.
Am I that irresistible?

305
00:29:15,654 --> 00:29:17,688
Eat my balls, Yi.

306
00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:23,229
You know where this came from?

307
00:29:23,729 --> 00:29:26,129
Can't you see I'm on break?

308
00:29:29,567 --> 00:29:32,037
Oh, howdy. How can I help you two?

309
00:29:32,137 --> 00:29:36,141
- You know where this arrow came from?
- Well, that's not an arrow, that is a bolt.

310
00:29:36,241 --> 00:29:39,111
- A bolt?
- Yes, a bolt, for a crossbow.

311
00:29:39,711 --> 00:29:43,082
It looks like an arrow,
but it's significantly heavier,

312
00:29:43,182 --> 00:29:45,417
has vastly different
flight characteristics.

313
00:29:45,517 --> 00:29:50,389
This one in particular belongs
to the sure shot 5000 series.

314
00:29:50,489 --> 00:29:52,492
Show it to me.

315
00:29:53,992 --> 00:29:56,896
It's a quality crossbow.
Manufactured in China.

316
00:29:56,996 --> 00:29:59,164
Guangzhou, I believe.

317
00:29:59,264 --> 00:30:01,233
Is this a popular model?

318
00:30:01,333 --> 00:30:03,269
Actually, sure shot's
a fledgling company.

319
00:30:03,369 --> 00:30:07,503
We're the only ones in the country to
carry it. But she's a real beaut, though.

320
00:30:07,604 --> 00:30:11,856
I mean, it's a fine bow.
Look at the craftsmanship on this baby.

321
00:30:11,957 --> 00:30:15,629
Titanium barrel, nickel inlay.
She's a true shot. Packs a real wallop.

322
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:18,484
You could take down a rabbit
at full stride from 100 feet.

323
00:30:18,584 --> 00:30:21,153
Pow! I mean, not "pow,"
'cause it's a crossbow, but "pfft!"

324
00:30:21,253 --> 00:30:24,021
My cat was murdered with that thing.

325
00:30:25,623 --> 00:30:28,193
- My cat too.
- Two cats?

326
00:30:28,893 --> 00:30:31,096
No, one cat, two owners.

327
00:30:31,196 --> 00:30:35,100
One cat, two cat, three cat,
blue cat! Does it matter?

328
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,304
He's dead, and the blood
is on your hands!

329
00:30:38,404 --> 00:30:39,425
Please, sir!

330
00:30:39,526 --> 00:30:41,800
- Who'd you sell it to?
- Excuse me?

331
00:30:41,901 --> 00:30:44,710
Who'd you sell the murder
weapon to, death master?

332
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:47,379
- Clinton, what are you...
- Hi, everybody. What's...

333
00:30:47,479 --> 00:30:50,748
What's going on over here? Steve?

334
00:30:53,817 --> 00:30:54,984
Greta?

335
00:30:57,121 --> 00:30:59,325
- You're...
- The commercial.

336
00:30:59,425 --> 00:31:01,593
Al Ford. How are you?

337
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:04,697
- What's the problem here, Steve?
- He called me "death master."

338
00:31:04,797 --> 00:31:07,766
"Death master"?
What is this "death master"?

339
00:31:08,166 --> 00:31:11,971
- Your crossbow killed my best friend.
- My God.

340
00:31:12,071 --> 00:31:15,474
- He means his cat.
- Oh. Right, right.

341
00:31:15,574 --> 00:31:17,676
I think I read that in the <i>Beacon.</i>

342
00:31:17,776 --> 00:31:20,346
Very, very sorry to hear
about that, son. Honestly.

343
00:31:20,446 --> 00:31:25,285
That somebody might use a product of mine
from this store in that sort of way just...

344
00:31:25,386 --> 00:31:29,252
it kills me. If there's anything I can do,
anything at all, you let me know.

345
00:31:30,988 --> 00:31:35,394
Okay. Thank you... yes.
I'd appreciate the names and information

346
00:31:35,495 --> 00:31:37,625
of every single person
who bought this thing.

347
00:31:37,726 --> 00:31:40,766
- That I cannot do.
- You shit-faced phony!

348
00:31:40,866 --> 00:31:44,136
- Goddamn it, Clinton, come on.
- Excuse me.

349
00:31:44,236 --> 00:31:46,739
We have privacy policies
here at this store, sir.

350
00:31:46,839 --> 00:31:50,809
Listen, we just want to take a
quick look at the sales inventory

351
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:54,047
to see the people who bought this thing,
and then we'll get out of here.

352
00:31:55,447 --> 00:31:58,284
Miss Chuplinski, as you well know,

353
00:31:58,384 --> 00:32:01,387
what you're asking for is
strictly against store policy.

354
00:32:01,487 --> 00:32:03,722
Now, I might have been able to
bend the rules a little bit here,

355
00:32:03,822 --> 00:32:09,261
but just quitting without any notice?
Leaving us all stranded here?

356
00:32:09,361 --> 00:32:12,498
Particularly in home and
patios during barbecue season.

357
00:32:12,598 --> 00:32:15,034
Failure to return your vest, Greta?

358
00:32:16,134 --> 00:32:20,539
All of this demonstrates blatant
disregard for this establishment.

359
00:32:20,639 --> 00:32:24,474
Now, that said, my office
is always open to you.

360
00:32:26,343 --> 00:32:30,215
- I'm out of here.
- Wait. What, you're going?

361
00:32:30,915 --> 00:32:33,834
Just show me the
goddamn inventory, Ford.

362
00:32:33,935 --> 00:32:37,721
- Can't do that.
- You really are a sham.

363
00:32:42,293 --> 00:32:44,763
Can you leave my store, please?

364
00:32:44,863 --> 00:32:46,863
All right, all right.

365
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,568
You want to play hardball?

366
00:32:53,337 --> 00:32:55,906
You've got yourself a hardball game.

367
00:33:15,426 --> 00:33:18,163
What is this all about?
What are you protesting?

368
00:33:18,263 --> 00:33:22,101
Wh... what am I...
isn't it obvious? Ford's.

369
00:33:22,201 --> 00:33:25,137
This store puts innocent lives at risk.

370
00:33:25,937 --> 00:33:29,750
Oh, my God! He's... he's just a boy!

371
00:33:29,851 --> 00:33:35,581
Exactly. And a very noble one.
He's fasting in protest, or he will.

372
00:33:35,681 --> 00:33:37,549
I'm bored. Let me down.

373
00:33:37,649 --> 00:33:40,684
You want your 30 bucks or not?
Just keep drumming.

374
00:33:44,956 --> 00:33:48,625
"Boo!" Yeah, again! Boo!

375
00:33:53,631 --> 00:33:55,666
Let me call you back.

376
00:33:55,766 --> 00:33:57,603
Hi, Frank.

377
00:33:57,703 --> 00:34:02,474
- Well, sorry about this.
- Yeah. Is that the Johnson boy up there?

378
00:34:02,574 --> 00:34:06,645
- Yeah. Can they get him down or...
- Yeah, they're... They'll get on it.

379
00:34:06,745 --> 00:34:10,249
- What about Clinton? Do you need any...
- No, no, no.

380
00:34:10,749 --> 00:34:13,953
You hear that? They're booing you, Ford.

381
00:34:14,653 --> 00:34:17,422
- You're finished.
- They're booing you, you idiot.

382
00:34:17,522 --> 00:34:21,527
Now, look, I told the Sheriff not to
intervene here, but you need to stop this.

383
00:34:21,627 --> 00:34:23,196
Hi, everybody.

384
00:34:24,596 --> 00:34:26,498
You are completely
out of line here, son.

385
00:34:26,598 --> 00:34:31,167
What's out of line is your store,
your products, and everything you stand for.

386
00:34:34,505 --> 00:34:37,876
Kid, I'm a business owner. Okay?

387
00:34:37,976 --> 00:34:41,878
Amongst other things,
I sell, sporting goods here,

388
00:34:44,382 --> 00:34:47,920
some of which is used for
what we call shooting sports.

389
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:51,623
Now, I'm no Maverick. Similar stores
to mine all across the country.

390
00:34:51,723 --> 00:34:55,694
I'm sorry about your cat.
I am. I like cats.

391
00:34:55,994 --> 00:34:58,797
But frankly, it's not my problem.

392
00:34:58,897 --> 00:35:01,099
You choke on a McNugget,
do blame McDonald's?

393
00:35:01,999 --> 00:35:03,201
Yeah.

394
00:35:03,401 --> 00:35:06,605
I bet you do, you little pinhead.
Listen, this whole charade is pointless.

395
00:35:06,705 --> 00:35:10,175
- All right. We'll see about that.
- No, we won't see, goddamn it.

396
00:35:10,275 --> 00:35:14,679
The sure shot 5000 is a bust.
Okay, you want the inventory information?

397
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:17,549
I'll give it to you.
Zero models have been sold.

398
00:35:17,649 --> 00:35:21,218
Zero. Do you get me?
It didn't come from my store.

399
00:35:21,319 --> 00:35:24,556
- That's impossible.
- It's a fact.

400
00:35:24,656 --> 00:35:29,158
Quit making a fool out of yourself before
I change my mind about pressing charges.

401
00:35:37,234 --> 00:35:40,105
Greta, we need to talk.

402
00:35:40,605 --> 00:35:44,509
Wow. Hi, Clinton. Yeah, come on in.
Just make yourself at home.

403
00:35:44,609 --> 00:35:48,378
It's about the crossbows.
We've hit a wall.

404
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:54,453
I'm sorry, Irv. Can you
excuse us for a second?

405
00:35:54,553 --> 00:35:56,519
Yeah.

406
00:35:59,057 --> 00:36:04,094
- Remember, she's my girl.
- All right, okay.

407
00:36:06,263 --> 00:36:08,900
Were you cutting Mouser's hair?

408
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:13,945
Yeah. I needed the practice,
and his hair was a mess.

409
00:36:14,046 --> 00:36:17,376
What? It was untamed and beautiful.

410
00:36:17,476 --> 00:36:19,911
I thought it was my best work.
Why are you all sweaty?

411
00:36:20,511 --> 00:36:25,050
I broke Ford. He claims no crossbows
were sold, but it doesn't add up.

412
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:28,053
Really? None?

413
00:36:28,153 --> 00:36:31,523
I don't know what to say. I mean,
maybe they came from "zang-zing" or whatever.

414
00:36:31,623 --> 00:36:36,394
Or maybe Ford is lying.
The crossbow had to come from his store.

415
00:36:36,494 --> 00:36:39,164
But this is a publicity
nightmare for him.

416
00:36:39,264 --> 00:36:44,464
Mr. family values is trying to protect
his image. Something is definitely off,

417
00:36:44,565 --> 00:36:47,940
and I'm gonna find out what.
Are you with me?

418
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,876
I don't know, Clinton.

419
00:36:50,976 --> 00:36:53,532
What the hell is going on with you?
You ditch me at Ford's

420
00:36:53,633 --> 00:36:56,262
and now you're just giving up?
I need your help.

421
00:36:56,363 --> 00:37:01,322
I'm not giving up. It's just, the police
and Fords... I mean, it's too much.

422
00:37:01,423 --> 00:37:04,890
- It's not worth it.
- "Too much"? Are you not hearing me?

423
00:37:04,990 --> 00:37:11,519
Ford is full of shit. Their crossbow
killed Mouser... Horatio... our cat.

424
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:15,233
These are the same scumbags who
drove my business out of town.

425
00:37:15,333 --> 00:37:17,269
They think they can just
push around the little guy.

426
00:37:17,369 --> 00:37:22,038
Well, this time the little guy is
gonna push back. Are you with me?

427
00:37:26,777 --> 00:37:29,212
Are we done? I have customer coming.

428
00:37:33,083 --> 00:37:37,654
Okay. Yeah. We're done.

429
00:38:40,117 --> 00:38:42,087
Reilly.

430
00:38:42,487 --> 00:38:44,454
Doghouse Reilly.

431
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:49,192
Ma? Can I get a ride to Ford's?

432
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:15,318
What the hell do you think you're doin'?

433
00:39:17,555 --> 00:39:21,360
- Who are you?
- I'm the new guy...

434
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,326
Greta.

435
00:39:27,765 --> 00:39:29,265
Okay.

436
00:39:58,228 --> 00:40:03,134
I know it, brother.
Another day, another dollar.

437
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:08,171
We got to keep our nose to
the grindstone, so to speak.

438
00:40:15,678 --> 00:40:18,217
Something was wrong with mine.

439
00:40:18,917 --> 00:40:23,722
So where are we keeping those sure
shot 5000s everyone's talking about?

440
00:40:24,122 --> 00:40:27,626
"Everyone's talking about"?
I don't know.

441
00:40:27,726 --> 00:40:30,392
Check sports, row J-12.

442
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:35,198
Thanks for the smoke, brother.

443
00:40:53,950 --> 00:40:55,917
Damn it.

444
00:40:57,554 --> 00:41:00,590
Yi, get over here!

445
00:41:07,531 --> 00:41:10,835
What have I told you about
smoking in the warehouse?

446
00:41:10,935 --> 00:41:13,469
Put it out. Now.

447
00:41:20,543 --> 00:41:23,512
- What are you doing?
- No smoking.

448
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:28,487
Oh. What's that over there?

449
00:41:29,387 --> 00:41:35,191
Oh, and is there something you want
to give me from your pocket? Hello.

450
00:41:38,495 --> 00:41:40,300
Get back to work.

451
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:48,206
We need to get these boxes to our man
by 4:00 sharp, so no ice-cream breaks.

452
00:41:48,306 --> 00:41:53,077
And, Dave, if you get
a flat tire this time,

453
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:55,311
do not call the police.

454
00:41:59,284 --> 00:42:03,119
Chin up, Tenderfoot.
I still have faith in you.

455
00:42:20,671 --> 00:42:22,304
Bingo!

456
00:43:54,431 --> 00:43:56,532
What are you doin', man?
What are you doin'?

457
00:44:12,983 --> 00:44:14,851
Greta?

458
00:44:23,727 --> 00:44:25,928
Excuse me.

459
00:44:37,307 --> 00:44:39,610
'Cause, you know, I prefer the sativa.

460
00:44:39,710 --> 00:44:42,981
That hemp star you gave
me was just too soporific.

461
00:44:43,081 --> 00:44:48,020
Ideally, I'd like the high to be strong
during office hours but peak during lecture.

462
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:51,087
Try this, Howie. I think you'll like it.

463
00:44:53,089 --> 00:44:54,225
Bravo.

464
00:44:54,325 --> 00:44:59,097
- Greta, we need to talk.
- Oh, Clinton. Holy shit.

465
00:44:59,697 --> 00:45:03,768
Okay. Hold on. This is for
you, and we're good here.

466
00:45:03,868 --> 00:45:06,335
I've never seen you. Thank you.

467
00:45:07,871 --> 00:45:13,411
Listen, I was chased all the
way here by a giant machine.

468
00:45:13,511 --> 00:45:17,415
He was a running machine.
I am lucky to be alive.

469
00:45:17,515 --> 00:45:19,584
He was so fast, so big...

470
00:45:19,684 --> 00:45:23,752
Okay, okay. Calm down.
Just take a second.

471
00:45:25,955 --> 00:45:29,627
- Clinton, what the hell happened to you?
- I broke into Ford's warehouse.

472
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:31,763
- You what?
- Yes. Okay?

473
00:45:31,863 --> 00:45:35,233
It was very dangerous,
but this is what I do, Greta.

474
00:45:35,333 --> 00:45:37,969
I'm like a clever mongoose, okay?

475
00:45:38,069 --> 00:45:40,805
Now, listen, it's deeper
than we thought, okay?

476
00:45:40,905 --> 00:45:45,309
The sure shots, Ford's... it's all connected.
That's obvious. But, I mean,

477
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:48,747
there's something bigger going on,
like a theft ring or something.

478
00:45:48,847 --> 00:45:52,083
- That guy, Kim Chi.
-  Kim Chi? Yi Kim?

479
00:45:52,183 --> 00:45:55,319
Right. There's something off about him.

480
00:45:55,419 --> 00:45:59,123
- Yeah, to say the least.
- Oh, what's that mean?

481
00:45:59,223 --> 00:46:03,294
I mean, he's weird. Like,
maybe the weirdest person I know.

482
00:46:03,394 --> 00:46:08,232
Well, I'm-I'm weird.
I mean, I'm a friggin' weirdo.

483
00:46:08,332 --> 00:46:12,303
You're minor-league weird.
I'm talking hall-of-fame weird.

484
00:46:12,403 --> 00:46:16,442
Like, if prince and pee-wee Herman had
a baby, it wouldn't play with Yi Kim.

485
00:46:17,542 --> 00:46:19,844
Whatever. It's not a competition, Greta.

486
00:46:19,944 --> 00:46:23,514
Listen, the point is that
"Lu Kang" and his man-child

487
00:46:23,614 --> 00:46:25,750
are stealing from the store, all right?

488
00:46:25,850 --> 00:46:29,554
They're using the unsold crossbow
boxes as a cover somehow.

489
00:46:29,654 --> 00:46:33,224
They're boosters, dropping of
the stolen goods to a fence.

490
00:46:33,324 --> 00:46:36,360
- "A fence"?
- A middleman. He unloads the hot items.

491
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:39,831
You never read the Hardy Boys?
Three investigators?

492
00:46:39,931 --> 00:46:43,301
All I know is that Carnival
Masker and his silent giant

493
00:46:43,401 --> 00:46:46,669
are the only two to have
access to the crossbows.

494
00:46:48,371 --> 00:46:51,375
What? What is it? What?

495
00:46:52,075 --> 00:46:53,377
Nothing.

496
00:46:54,077 --> 00:46:59,348
"Nothing"? You're acting all tense and weird,
and you tore your coaster to shreds.

497
00:47:04,587 --> 00:47:06,290
You knew about this.

498
00:47:06,390 --> 00:47:09,594
Clinton, that's crazy.
What are you talking about?

499
00:47:09,694 --> 00:47:12,330
Two glenlivets, neat.

500
00:47:12,430 --> 00:47:16,334
Oh, hey. We're having a
private discussion here.

501
00:47:16,434 --> 00:47:19,203
- If we wanted to include you...
- Simmer down, darlin'.

502
00:47:19,303 --> 00:47:21,970
It's courtesy of the
gentleman over there.

503
00:47:40,156 --> 00:47:41,857
Shit.

504
00:47:47,896 --> 00:47:49,397
I remember.

505
00:47:53,236 --> 00:47:56,405
I don't think we've
officially met. Yi Kim.

506
00:47:58,207 --> 00:48:02,311
That's Dave Calvetti.
I didn't catch your name.

507
00:48:04,814 --> 00:48:06,817
- Clint...
- Excuse...

508
00:48:06,917 --> 00:48:09,887
- It's Clinton.
- "Clinton."

509
00:48:09,987 --> 00:48:12,855
- It's Clinton.
- "Ton."

510
00:48:15,892 --> 00:48:17,760
Your shot's collecting dust.

511
00:48:19,796 --> 00:48:24,833
- I-I don't... I don't really...
- Drink... it.

512
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:39,717
Oh, let's go for a little walk?

513
00:48:39,817 --> 00:48:42,920
The varnish in this place, it...

514
00:48:43,020 --> 00:48:45,988
smells like sadness.

515
00:48:50,026 --> 00:48:53,896
- Yi, where the hell are we going?
- We're going on a little trip, Greta bear.

516
00:48:56,866 --> 00:49:00,269
So, Clinton, you like Greta?

517
00:49:03,406 --> 00:49:06,310
Oh. You don't say much, do you?

518
00:49:06,810 --> 00:49:11,015
It must be complicated.
We all know how Greta loves a challenge.

519
00:49:11,115 --> 00:49:13,017
All right, what is this?

520
00:49:14,552 --> 00:49:16,554
Take it easy.

521
00:49:16,654 --> 00:49:18,387
You'll see.

522
00:49:28,564 --> 00:49:30,935
All right, this is getting old, Yi.

523
00:49:31,635 --> 00:49:33,771
Come on, Clinton, let's go.

524
00:49:33,871 --> 00:49:38,009
Hey! All right, look, Kano,
or whatever your name is,

525
00:49:38,109 --> 00:49:42,480
I don't know what you're trying to pull,
but I know what's going on. Oh, Christ!

526
00:49:43,948 --> 00:49:49,118
Hey, we're all friends here.
We all trust each other, don't we?

527
00:49:54,491 --> 00:49:56,561
Let go of her!

528
00:49:58,761 --> 00:50:02,701
I am feeling it! You feeling it, Dave?

529
00:50:04,401 --> 00:50:07,305
Love it! You feeling it, Clinton?

530
00:50:07,405 --> 00:50:08,940
I...

531
00:50:09,740 --> 00:50:11,940
Yeah, yeah, I guess.

532
00:50:12,776 --> 00:50:14,713
Give me your hand.

533
00:50:15,713 --> 00:50:17,815
Do we trust each other?

534
00:50:17,915 --> 00:50:20,084
- Please! Stop!
- We're in this together now.

535
00:50:20,184 --> 00:50:22,054
Clinton, please!

536
00:50:23,154 --> 00:50:25,089
Please, Yi, don't do this!

537
00:50:26,189 --> 00:50:28,860
You've been a nosy little kitty cat.

538
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:32,494
But I trust you now.

539
00:50:35,098 --> 00:50:37,268
No. There's no one else.

540
00:50:37,768 --> 00:50:42,171
I don't have to justify anything to you,
okay? Just stay out of my life.

541
00:50:58,021 --> 00:51:00,658
How... how did I get here?

542
00:51:02,158 --> 00:51:06,030
We walked. Well, I sort of carried you.

543
00:51:06,130 --> 00:51:08,466
I don't remember any of that.

544
00:51:08,566 --> 00:51:13,437
Oh, my God. Do I have a memory loss?
Was I hit by the train?

545
00:51:13,537 --> 00:51:15,706
Yeah, if that's what you
consider Dave Calvetti.

546
00:51:15,806 --> 00:51:18,540
You're fine. You're just
a little bruised, that's all.

547
00:51:21,978 --> 00:51:24,448
- I got to go. I got to...
- No, wait. No, wait.

548
00:51:24,548 --> 00:51:26,548
Stay here. Stay here.

549
00:51:28,485 --> 00:51:30,755
My God.

550
00:51:34,225 --> 00:51:38,861
Here. Try this. It's my special recipe.

551
00:51:41,731 --> 00:51:45,803
Oh, my God. What is this?
Just boiled whiskey?

552
00:51:46,203 --> 00:51:48,270
Yeah, pretty much.

553
00:51:53,843 --> 00:51:56,547
Hey. Who's this guy?

554
00:51:56,647 --> 00:51:59,681
- Come on.
- Did you make him too?

555
00:52:01,684 --> 00:52:03,686
Yeah.

556
00:52:08,491 --> 00:52:12,194
Kind of look like they go together.
Are they partners?

557
00:52:14,631 --> 00:52:16,098
Yeah.

558
00:52:17,700 --> 00:52:22,440
That's pretty good.
How long have you been doing this?

559
00:52:22,940 --> 00:52:25,709
Oh, I don't know.
Since I was a kid, I guess.

560
00:52:25,809 --> 00:52:28,479
So you had your own little workshop?

561
00:52:28,979 --> 00:52:33,882
I used to run around in tighty-whities and
a trench coat and interrogate strangers.

562
00:52:35,718 --> 00:52:37,054
Pretty cute.

563
00:52:37,954 --> 00:52:39,288
I was 15.

564
00:52:42,425 --> 00:52:45,861
- Okay.
- I was imaginative.

565
00:52:47,397 --> 00:52:50,201
Yeah. Sounds like you were a handful.

566
00:52:51,001 --> 00:52:53,904
What'd your parents think?

567
00:52:54,004 --> 00:52:58,642
Well, my dad hated it. "Puss-bag"...
that's what he used to call me.

568
00:52:58,742 --> 00:53:02,067
"Puss-bag"? What does that even mean?

569
00:53:02,168 --> 00:53:05,916
I-I don't know. "Puss," like "pussy,"

570
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:10,554
and, like, "bag,"
like a bag of it, like a...

571
00:53:10,654 --> 00:53:14,392
Like a bag of-of pussies.
Like a bag full of pussies, I guess.

572
00:53:14,492 --> 00:53:17,292
I don't know. It doesn't make any sense.

573
00:53:19,295 --> 00:53:21,932
He sounds like an asshole.

574
00:53:22,532 --> 00:53:25,736
- You still live with him?
- Oh, hell, no.

575
00:53:25,836 --> 00:53:29,006
He moved on to greener pastures,

576
00:53:29,106 --> 00:53:33,110
and he's got some new family in Texas

577
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:38,781
and owns some puss-bag store.
I don't know.

578
00:53:43,786 --> 00:53:45,387
What?

579
00:53:49,092 --> 00:53:50,094
What?

580
00:53:51,194 --> 00:53:56,033
Get up. I want to do
something for you. Come on.

581
00:53:56,133 --> 00:53:58,700
- What?
- Don't argue with me.

582
00:54:00,970 --> 00:54:03,205
No, no, no, no. I don't know about this.

583
00:54:32,735 --> 00:54:34,570
What do you think?

584
00:54:36,406 --> 00:54:40,044
It's... I don't know.

585
00:54:40,144 --> 00:54:41,780
Okay.

586
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:45,282
- You look older.
- Oh, great, thanks.

587
00:54:45,782 --> 00:54:49,720
That was a compliment.
I was saying you look handsome.

588
00:54:49,820 --> 00:54:51,622
You know, like a man.

589
00:54:51,722 --> 00:54:54,222
Yeah, I don't know if I
want to look like a man.

590
00:54:57,093 --> 00:54:58,293
I like it.

591
00:55:27,890 --> 00:55:30,092
Are you sure you want this?

592
00:55:31,961 --> 00:55:33,397
What do you mean?

593
00:55:34,197 --> 00:55:36,300
I need someone to be with me.

594
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:40,302
With you, like, to find Mouser's killer?

595
00:55:42,171 --> 00:55:46,377
- Is that all you can think about?
- I'm not sure what we're talking about.

596
00:55:47,477 --> 00:55:52,149
Our cat is dead, Clinton,
but he brought us together.

597
00:55:52,749 --> 00:55:55,016
To find his killer.

598
00:55:57,987 --> 00:56:01,892
My life has enough problems.

599
00:56:01,992 --> 00:56:05,763
You can't just run around in a trench
coat and tighty-whities forever.

600
00:56:05,863 --> 00:56:08,365
Okay. I see how it is.

601
00:56:08,865 --> 00:56:11,201
No, you don't.
That's what I'm trying to say.

602
00:56:11,301 --> 00:56:13,435
I know what you're trying to say.

603
00:56:15,838 --> 00:56:18,140
You're just like everybody else.

604
00:56:22,545 --> 00:56:26,283
I knew about the scam, okay?

605
00:56:26,383 --> 00:56:29,219
Why do you think I left the store?

606
00:56:29,319 --> 00:56:34,291
Don't you get it? Yi's dangerous.
It's not worth it.

607
00:56:34,891 --> 00:56:36,892
Let it go, Clinton.

608
00:56:40,630 --> 00:56:42,864
Thanks for the tip.

609
00:57:07,890 --> 00:57:09,224
Who is that?

610
00:57:54,771 --> 00:57:57,975
Clinton. You're up.

611
00:57:58,475 --> 00:57:59,677
Good morning.

612
00:58:00,377 --> 00:58:04,081
Clinton, honey,
you remember Frank, don't you?

613
00:58:04,181 --> 00:58:07,084
No, actually. I don't know any Frank.

614
00:58:07,184 --> 00:58:12,222
I know a Sheriff Hoyle, but no...
Is he wearing my robe?

615
00:58:12,822 --> 00:58:18,095
Honey, I didn't know if you were...
coming home last night, and...

616
00:58:18,195 --> 00:58:21,465
- Don't worry, Clinton. I'll wash it.
- No. Don't bother.

617
00:58:21,565 --> 00:58:25,480
It's just one of the few creature comforts
to which I've ever really been attached,

618
00:58:25,581 --> 00:58:30,875
but burn it, because I am never wearing
that thing again as long as I live.

619
00:58:30,975 --> 00:58:33,911
Hey, you got a haircut.
It looks very distinguished.

620
00:58:34,011 --> 00:58:36,547
- It does.
- Would you stop talking about my hair?

621
00:58:36,647 --> 00:58:39,283
Honey, why don't you
just sit down for a second?

622
00:58:39,383 --> 00:58:42,186
And eat something. Look what I made.
Chocolate pancake...

623
00:58:42,286 --> 00:58:46,990
Oops. Sorry. I'll eat that one.
You take that one. And bacon...

624
00:58:47,090 --> 00:58:50,625
Yeah, only because there's
people starving in the world.

625
00:58:55,164 --> 00:58:59,069
Where have you been, Clinton?
I've been worried about you.

626
00:58:59,169 --> 00:59:01,371
Really? You were worried?

627
00:59:01,471 --> 00:59:05,341
You had time to worry during your
sex-capades with this doughnut-husker?

628
00:59:05,442 --> 00:59:08,045
- Hey, come on, now. Watch your mouth.
- You watch your mouth.

629
00:59:08,146 --> 00:59:10,447
This is my house, and I
can act however I want.

630
00:59:10,547 --> 00:59:13,384
Actually, you know, it's my house,
and is it too much to ask for you

631
00:59:13,484 --> 00:59:15,083
to just be nice for once?

632
00:59:16,385 --> 00:59:17,519
"Nice"?

633
00:59:20,556 --> 00:59:23,425
Okay. I'll be nice.

634
00:59:26,195 --> 00:59:28,432
I got a nice little tip for you.

635
00:59:29,132 --> 00:59:34,669
She's got the gout. Real bad.
That's why she always wears socks.

636
00:59:46,515 --> 00:59:49,317
I have... chilly feet.

637
00:59:54,656 --> 00:59:58,061
Clinton, look, I know this
is a little bit awkward,

638
00:59:58,161 --> 01:00:00,895
but I'd like for us to
try and be friends.

639
01:00:04,167 --> 01:00:07,905
All right. Let's be friends.

640
01:00:08,005 --> 01:00:11,074
I found out who killed Mouser,
and I want to go there today.

641
01:00:11,174 --> 01:00:13,443
- Come on. What is this?
- Yi Kim.

642
01:00:13,543 --> 01:00:17,581
He's the one who killed Mouser, and I
want to nail him, Hoyle, today, now.

643
01:00:17,981 --> 01:00:21,017
You mean Rogin Kim's son,
of Kim's tuxedos?

644
01:00:21,117 --> 01:00:24,021
I don't want to assume,
but probably, right?

645
01:00:24,121 --> 01:00:27,257
Speaking of which, you might want to case
that joint, see if the money's clean.

646
01:00:27,357 --> 01:00:30,494
As for Yi, he is filthy.
He's running this huge scam

647
01:00:30,594 --> 01:00:33,597
involving crossbows and
computers out of Ford's.

648
01:00:33,697 --> 01:00:38,201
He killed Mouser to put the scare into Greta.
She's the one who stole Mouser.

649
01:00:38,301 --> 01:00:41,038
She quit Ford's after
she learned of the scam.

650
01:00:41,138 --> 01:00:43,240
Frankly, this all sounds
pretty ridiculous.

651
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:46,207
You're doing it, or I'm
driving you out of here.

652
01:00:48,210 --> 01:00:50,845
All right. I got a little
time before my shift.

653
01:01:10,199 --> 01:01:11,433
You left this.

654
01:01:17,373 --> 01:01:19,207
I was hoping maybe we could talk.

655
01:01:23,579 --> 01:01:25,883
I'm sorry things got...

656
01:01:26,383 --> 01:01:28,419
weird last night.

657
01:01:29,319 --> 01:01:32,422
Excuse me, Clinton. We'd better
get going if we're gonna do this.

658
01:01:32,522 --> 01:01:34,157
Yeah.

659
01:01:34,257 --> 01:01:38,562
Yeah, just warm 'er up, Hoyle. I'll meet you
in the squad car in T minus one minute.

660
01:01:38,662 --> 01:01:40,164
What are you doing?

661
01:01:41,264 --> 01:01:44,368
I'm taking care of a little
thing called "justice."

662
01:01:44,468 --> 01:01:47,802
It's not a good day to be Yi Kim,
if you know what I mean.

663
01:01:49,672 --> 01:01:54,342
Clinton, please don't do this.
I'm telling you, it'll come back to us.

664
01:01:56,245 --> 01:01:57,815
Right.

665
01:01:58,315 --> 01:01:59,848
Excuse me.

666
01:02:01,117 --> 01:02:02,452
Clinton!

667
01:02:02,552 --> 01:02:04,552
This ends today.

668
01:02:11,327 --> 01:02:15,632
Rich, spoiled bastard.
Makes you sick, right?

669
01:02:15,732 --> 01:02:20,037
Look, Clinton, what we're doing here is
not exactly department protocol, okay?

670
01:02:20,137 --> 01:02:24,274
So you can't go poking around
in there, making accusations.

671
01:02:24,374 --> 01:02:28,979
We don't have a warrant.
Just let me do the talking, okay?

672
01:02:29,079 --> 01:02:32,316
I got it. I got it. Silent muscle.

673
01:02:32,416 --> 01:02:37,154
And don't worry. This place is gonna be
stacked to the ceiling with stolen product.

674
01:02:37,254 --> 01:02:39,921
I'm pretty much handing
you an easy collar.

675
01:02:44,260 --> 01:02:46,361
Let's nail this perp.

676
01:02:58,174 --> 01:02:59,741
Oh. All right.

677
01:03:08,350 --> 01:03:10,387
Who the hell are you? Where's Yi Kim?

678
01:03:11,487 --> 01:03:13,957
Hi, sweetie. Is your father home?

679
01:03:14,657 --> 01:03:16,359
Dad!

680
01:03:16,459 --> 01:03:18,495
I bet he heard that.

681
01:03:18,595 --> 01:03:23,132
May we come inside? The police need to
speak to your brother. He's in trouble.

682
01:03:23,232 --> 01:03:25,233
We'll wait for your daddy.

683
01:03:28,470 --> 01:03:29,808
Yi.

684
01:03:31,808 --> 01:03:35,445
- What's going on, dad?
- Some people here to talk to you.

685
01:03:35,545 --> 01:03:37,747
Yi, I'm Sheriff Hoyle. I'd...

686
01:03:37,847 --> 01:03:40,918
Wow. That is... that's your sister.

687
01:03:41,018 --> 01:03:43,887
- Right? That is outstanding.
- Thank you.

688
01:03:43,987 --> 01:03:48,191
I'm still struggling with it, you know?
Oak is such a tricky medium.

689
01:03:48,291 --> 01:03:50,160
Still trying to work on
the eyelashes, but...

690
01:03:50,260 --> 01:03:51,528
Beautiful.

691
01:03:51,828 --> 01:03:55,899
Thank you, officer. Anyway, what's...
What's going on?

692
01:03:55,999 --> 01:04:00,270
Don't act like you don't know.
You know exactly why we're here, Yi.

693
01:04:00,870 --> 01:04:04,207
- It's Clinton, right?
- You got it, Yi.

694
01:04:04,307 --> 01:04:06,209
- Hi.
- It's over.

695
01:04:06,309 --> 01:04:10,814
I've already told them everything...
the store, the threat, my cat.

696
01:04:10,914 --> 01:04:14,284
Just come clean now, and we
might be able to cut you a deal.

697
01:04:14,384 --> 01:04:17,105
- We can do that, right, Hoyle?
- Shut up, Clinton.

698
01:04:17,506 --> 01:04:20,888
Yi, can you tell me about what
happened yesterday at the Megastore?

699
01:04:22,591 --> 01:04:24,294
Well...

700
01:04:24,394 --> 01:04:26,830
I wanted to be forgiving
about this whole thing.

701
01:04:26,930 --> 01:04:32,236
I didn't want to report it, but...
I guess I just don't have a choice.

702
01:04:32,936 --> 01:04:35,939
Clinton broke into the warehouse
at Ford's Megastore yesterday.

703
01:04:36,039 --> 01:04:41,044
Call me a softy, but he
was apologetic, and I accepted that.

704
01:04:41,144 --> 01:04:43,313
I didn't think we had to get
the authorities involved.

705
01:04:43,413 --> 01:04:46,483
- You broke into the Megastore?
- No! Come on...

706
01:04:46,983 --> 01:04:50,887
Well, technically yes, but it was for
the purpose of good. I was undercover.

707
01:04:50,987 --> 01:04:54,424
- I was deep cover.
- Wait. This is your partner?

708
01:04:54,524 --> 01:04:56,726
- Absolutely not, no.
- Basically, yes.

709
01:04:56,826 --> 01:04:59,829
Look, okay. He is stealing
from Ford's, all right?

710
01:04:59,929 --> 01:05:03,733
He is running a scam where he
puts crossbows in computer boxes.

711
01:05:03,833 --> 01:05:08,205
I mean, computers in crossbow boxes.

712
01:05:08,305 --> 01:05:09,718
It's very elaborate.

713
01:05:09,819 --> 01:05:13,543
Clinton, this is what I get for taking
pity on you at the warehouse yesterday?

714
01:05:13,643 --> 01:05:17,747
Goddamn it! He's lying through his teeth!
Can't you see? I want to see his room.

715
01:05:17,847 --> 01:05:19,883
May I go to his room?

716
01:05:20,383 --> 01:05:22,352
Well, Mr. Kim, if you wouldn't mind,

717
01:05:22,452 --> 01:05:24,657
- could we take a look at your room?
- Of course.

718
01:05:24,758 --> 01:05:29,559
I guarantee it's just loaded with
stolen merchandise... burner phones...

719
01:05:29,659 --> 01:05:31,962
I don't know. I'm not a criminal.
Let's go find out.

720
01:05:32,062 --> 01:05:33,964
Let's take a quick look,
if you don't mind.

721
01:05:34,064 --> 01:05:35,563
- Yeah. Of course.
- Great.

722
01:05:44,073 --> 01:05:46,509
Well, I think we've bothered
these two enough for one day.

723
01:05:46,609 --> 01:05:48,409
Hold on.

724
01:05:50,646 --> 01:05:54,115
- Clinton, no.
- It's okay. I don't mind.

725
01:06:02,991 --> 01:06:05,160
Don't mind if I do.

726
01:06:10,999 --> 01:06:15,072
Oh, what's this? These the numbers
you're running for your operation?

727
01:06:15,172 --> 01:06:19,576
These your... your crooked books?
What am I looking at?

728
01:06:20,176 --> 01:06:24,547
No. Those are the plans for the tree
house my father and I are building.

729
01:06:24,647 --> 01:06:28,952
- "Tree house"?
- Yes, for my sister and all her friends.

730
01:06:29,252 --> 01:06:32,923
Okay. Time to go. Gentlemen,
I apologize for the intrusion.

731
01:06:33,023 --> 01:06:35,759
- We will be on our way now.
- No problem at all.

732
01:06:35,859 --> 01:06:39,429
Oh, look there.
You're a Lincoln admirer?

733
01:06:39,529 --> 01:06:41,498
I'm a Lincoln man myself.

734
01:06:42,098 --> 01:06:45,503
"Leave nothing for tomorrow
which can be done today."

735
01:06:45,603 --> 01:06:48,371
"The demon of intemperance
ever seems to have delighted

736
01:06:48,471 --> 01:06:50,940
in sucking the blood of
genius and of generosity."

737
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:55,578
Springfield, Illinois.
February 22nd, 1842.

738
01:06:55,678 --> 01:06:58,815
Wow. That is very impressive.

739
01:06:58,915 --> 01:07:01,685
- You must be very proud, Mr. Kim.
- I am.

740
01:07:01,785 --> 01:07:04,988
- Quite a young man.
- Thank you. That was my high-school project.

741
01:07:05,088 --> 01:07:06,990
- Yeah?
- Yeah. My pencil.

742
01:07:07,090 --> 01:07:08,558
Oh, my... You did that?

743
01:07:08,658 --> 01:07:12,095
Wow, that is... I thought that
was one of the old photographs.

744
01:07:12,195 --> 01:07:15,630
That's unbelievable.
Unbelievable. Come on, Clinton.

745
01:07:25,073 --> 01:07:27,077
Clinton, I really like your mom.

746
01:07:27,477 --> 01:07:29,861
She's a beautiful, wonderful woman,

747
01:07:29,962 --> 01:07:34,051
so I'm gonna pretend I didn't hear
a couple things I heard back there.

748
01:07:34,451 --> 01:07:37,487
This is the second person who's
accused you of breaking and entering.

749
01:07:37,587 --> 01:07:42,092
We're talking multiple felonies here.
If it happens again, I'm hauling you in.

750
01:07:42,192 --> 01:07:46,494
Got it? You're done with this. Leave it
to the authorities. And I'm not asking.

751
01:07:48,664 --> 01:07:53,635
You're right, Frank,
and I appreciate that.

752
01:07:55,971 --> 01:08:01,478
Now that we know each other better and
that you're involved with my mom and all,

753
01:08:02,078 --> 01:08:05,513
there's something I
think I should tell you.

754
01:08:32,508 --> 01:08:33,841
Come on, come on.

755
01:08:35,877 --> 01:08:36,911
Gotcha.

756
01:08:39,848 --> 01:08:41,649
Bingo.

757
01:09:08,244 --> 01:09:10,180
- Can I help you?
- Mrs. Ford.

758
01:09:10,280 --> 01:09:12,715
Are you... I need to speak with Ford.

759
01:09:13,515 --> 01:09:17,821
Mrs. Ford is not here right now,
and Mr. Ford is not well.

760
01:09:17,921 --> 01:09:20,906
For disclosure: I'm a detective.
I don't want to alarm you,

761
01:09:21,007 --> 01:09:24,494
- but you're in danger.
- I'm sorry. Mr. Ford said no visitors.

762
01:09:24,594 --> 01:09:27,030
He's sick, not feeling well?
I'll come back.

763
01:09:27,130 --> 01:09:28,665
I'm sorry to bother you. I'll come...

764
01:09:28,765 --> 01:09:30,166
Oh, no, senor!

765
01:09:30,266 --> 01:09:33,603
- Ford?
- No! Senor, no, you...

766
01:09:33,703 --> 01:09:35,803
- Ford, where are you?
- You can't go up there, senor!

767
01:09:37,639 --> 01:09:41,144
Ford. I have some urgent information...

768
01:09:41,644 --> 01:09:46,115
Oh, Mr. Ford, I'm sorry.
He wouldn't listen. He just come in.

769
01:09:46,215 --> 01:09:48,651
Do you want me to take him out?

770
01:09:48,751 --> 01:09:50,186
No, no, that's fine.

771
01:09:50,686 --> 01:09:52,855
Can I bring you anything?

772
01:09:53,255 --> 01:09:55,058
- Ice cream.
- We're out of ice cream, sir.

773
01:09:55,158 --> 01:09:58,593
Okay, bourbon in a pint glass.
Fill it up to the brim.

774
01:10:01,731 --> 01:10:03,733
What the hell happened to you, Ford?

775
01:10:03,833 --> 01:10:07,570
Jesus. You look like
some kind of transient.

776
01:10:07,870 --> 01:10:10,039
You ever seen <i>angel and the badman?</i>

777
01:10:10,139 --> 01:10:14,245
- No, I don't think so.
- I've watched it four times...

778
01:10:15,345 --> 01:10:18,923
today. And its meaning is
becoming more clear to me.

779
01:10:19,024 --> 01:10:21,851
Watch this. Look. Yeah.

780
01:10:21,951 --> 01:10:24,687
Ford, I am here to talk
to you about your store.

781
01:10:24,787 --> 01:10:27,790
There is a major theft
operation going on.

782
01:10:27,890 --> 01:10:32,496
Just watch this. Watch.
Look. They cut to him.

783
01:10:32,596 --> 01:10:36,163
He does this thing
with his face. Like that.

784
01:10:39,966 --> 01:10:42,872
Okay, look. Yi Kim is stealing from you.

785
01:10:42,972 --> 01:10:47,742
He's running a huge scam right under your
nose. He's the one who murdered my cat.

786
01:10:51,680 --> 01:10:54,117
What are... What are you...

787
01:10:54,217 --> 01:10:56,886
You're the kid from the store.

788
01:10:56,986 --> 01:11:00,420
Yeah. Who did you think I was?

789
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:08,562
- What's this?
- A fax, senor, from Mrs. Ford.

790
01:11:12,835 --> 01:11:15,670
And now she's afraid to come in person?

791
01:11:22,811 --> 01:11:25,715
Damn it! Everything?
I'm not signing this, okay?

792
01:11:25,815 --> 01:11:29,285
You can tell the Levinson,
Levinson, and Waffberg firm

793
01:11:29,385 --> 01:11:31,821
that I'll see her in hell
before I sign that!

794
01:11:31,921 --> 01:11:35,725
She's not taking everything from me!
And where's my bourbon?

795
01:11:36,325 --> 01:11:39,629
You threw it against the wall.

796
01:11:39,729 --> 01:11:43,633
Is that right? Is that what I did?
You got all the answers now?

797
01:11:43,733 --> 01:11:46,302
You think that Yi Kim is
stealing from Al Ford?

798
01:11:46,402 --> 01:11:50,306
Is that it? Al Ford doesn't get
scammed by weirdo stock boys!

799
01:11:50,406 --> 01:11:54,010
"Product photos for resale." You see?

800
01:11:54,110 --> 01:11:57,300
He's stealing them in surplus
crossbow boxes and handing them off,

801
01:11:57,401 --> 01:12:01,182
thousands of dollars' worth.
I just don't know who the fence is.

802
01:12:02,651 --> 01:12:04,685
Son of a bitch.

803
01:12:08,323 --> 01:12:10,760
- Greta.
- What? Wait. Well, she knew,

804
01:12:10,860 --> 01:12:14,764
but she... Actually,
I don't think she knew. She's...

805
01:12:14,864 --> 01:12:17,701
Is everybody in the world
trying to fuck me?

806
01:12:18,201 --> 01:12:20,000
Wait. Ford!

807
01:12:21,503 --> 01:12:24,438
Ford, what the hell are you doing?

808
01:12:26,142 --> 01:12:27,777
Where are you going?

809
01:12:27,877 --> 01:12:30,847
- What are you doing?
- This is my matter too.

810
01:12:30,947 --> 01:12:32,513
I don't give a shit!

811
01:12:45,527 --> 01:12:48,863
Hey. We just passed Yi's.

812
01:12:51,934 --> 01:12:53,834
Ford, where are we going?

813
01:13:02,344 --> 01:13:06,215
- What the hell are we doing here?
- Greta? Greta!

814
01:13:06,315 --> 01:13:12,119
Did you really think I wouldn't find out?
I know exactly what's going on!

815
01:13:13,922 --> 01:13:18,394
- Geez! Hey! Are you deaf?
- Hey! You want to hurt me?

816
01:13:19,094 --> 01:13:24,565
Ford, I'm telling you, it's Yi!
She's got nothing to do with this.

817
01:13:26,469 --> 01:13:28,137
Greta, I don't know.

818
01:13:28,537 --> 01:13:31,220
What? No! What the hell?

819
01:13:31,921 --> 01:13:35,478
- How about that?
- Ford! She... stop it!

820
01:13:35,578 --> 01:13:38,715
I know exactly what's
going on, you crazy bitch!

821
01:13:39,315 --> 01:13:40,881
Ford!

822
01:13:43,151 --> 01:13:46,887
How about that? You want
to hurt me? I'll hurt you!

823
01:13:48,724 --> 01:13:50,727
Are you insane?

824
01:13:51,427 --> 01:13:54,261
I got nothing to do with this.

825
01:13:55,564 --> 01:13:59,400
Ford, I told you, she is innocent!

826
01:14:01,269 --> 01:14:02,806
You idiot.

827
01:14:03,806 --> 01:14:06,106
She's the fence.

828
01:14:18,954 --> 01:14:20,454
How could you?

829
01:14:21,590 --> 01:14:23,157
You're the fence?

830
01:14:26,094 --> 01:14:31,168
Just get out of here, Clinton.
I don't ever want to see you again.

831
01:14:32,068 --> 01:14:33,534
Go!

832
01:15:02,563 --> 01:15:06,369
- Ma, not now.
- Okay. I just want to ask you a question.

833
01:15:06,469 --> 01:15:09,438
- Yeah, and I would like the truth.
- Okay.

834
01:15:10,238 --> 01:15:14,308
Did you tell Frank that I have aids?

835
01:15:17,612 --> 01:15:20,648
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Well...

836
01:15:22,317 --> 01:15:24,821
It was in a certain context.

837
01:15:25,221 --> 01:15:28,257
Mom, what... what are you doing?

838
01:15:28,357 --> 01:15:30,993
Hey! Hey! Stop it! Stop...

839
01:15:31,093 --> 01:15:34,964
It was a joke, ma.
Hoyle obviously has no sense of humor.

840
01:15:35,064 --> 01:15:37,433
- Stop!
- Frank was right. I have spoiled you.

841
01:15:37,533 --> 01:15:39,602
This is for your own good!

842
01:15:39,702 --> 01:15:44,007
Hoyle said that? You're gonna take
his side over your own child's?

843
01:15:44,107 --> 01:15:46,442
Have you noticed that
you're a grown man?

844
01:15:46,542 --> 01:15:49,078
- You're a grown man.
- Ma, you know how much this is worth?

845
01:15:49,178 --> 01:15:51,614
- It's worth nothing. Look at this.
- Stop it!

846
01:15:51,714 --> 01:15:55,919
- You've humiliated me!
- Ma, this is an original!

847
01:15:56,619 --> 01:15:59,953
- Ma!
- Go sleep at the bus stop!

848
01:16:05,026 --> 01:16:07,428
Ma, I'll die out here.

849
01:17:24,606 --> 01:17:26,376
Ford.

850
01:17:27,176 --> 01:17:29,877
Ford's the fence.

851
01:17:31,980 --> 01:17:34,648
He's stealing from himself.

852
01:17:55,369 --> 01:17:57,640
Ford, I know everything.

853
01:17:57,740 --> 01:17:59,807
No, turn the flash...

854
01:18:01,376 --> 01:18:04,681
- Yi?
- Clintonio.

855
01:18:06,081 --> 01:18:11,220
Oh, my God. Oh, my God, Yi.
Did Ford do this to you?

856
01:18:11,320 --> 01:18:13,456
Clintonio...

857
01:18:14,256 --> 01:18:16,356
your pocket.

858
01:18:18,493 --> 01:18:21,430
What the... What the hell is that?

859
01:18:21,530 --> 01:18:25,432
I-I don't under... I don't understand...

860
01:18:30,505 --> 01:18:35,511
How did... All right, I'm-I'm...
Yi, I'm calling the police.

861
01:18:35,611 --> 01:18:37,713
- Okay?
- Okay.

862
01:18:37,813 --> 01:18:40,116
I... wait. Okay.

863
01:18:40,216 --> 01:18:43,552
Guys... guys, what's going on?

864
01:18:43,652 --> 01:18:45,788
Greta bear...

865
01:18:45,888 --> 01:18:48,758
Greta... what-what... Where is she?

866
01:18:48,858 --> 01:18:51,859
- She needs you.
- Where is she?

867
01:18:53,461 --> 01:18:55,131
Avignon...

868
01:18:55,931 --> 01:19:00,236
Avignon... the bar. The bar.
She's at the bar. Okay.

869
01:19:00,336 --> 01:19:03,871
All right. He's gonna be okay.
Just call the police.

870
01:19:11,245 --> 01:19:12,913
Ford?

871
01:19:21,489 --> 01:19:23,457
Yeah, come on out.

872
01:19:25,626 --> 01:19:27,964
You had to have everything?

873
01:19:29,164 --> 01:19:33,342
You put up your Megastore in our little
town and run out all the small businesses,

874
01:19:33,443 --> 01:19:35,537
including mine.

875
01:19:36,138 --> 01:19:41,277
And you turned a massive profit.
But that wasn't enough for you.

876
01:19:41,977 --> 01:19:45,882
The palace, the fast cars.

877
01:19:46,482 --> 01:19:50,184
No, you needed another
chandelier for your chandelier.

878
01:19:51,719 --> 01:19:55,624
So what did you do?
You ran a scam from the inside.

879
01:19:55,724 --> 01:19:59,662
And you were sitting pretty
until your assistant manager

880
01:19:59,762 --> 01:20:02,765
caught wind of it and quit on you.

881
01:20:02,865 --> 01:20:05,267
And then what'd you do?
You had to shut her up, right?

882
01:20:05,867 --> 01:20:11,373
You killed her beloved cat
with an untraceable crossbow.

883
01:20:11,473 --> 01:20:14,674
You sick bastard.

884
01:20:16,311 --> 01:20:20,316
But you didn't count on that cat
having another owner, did you?

885
01:20:20,516 --> 01:20:23,819
A pinhead. A loser.

886
01:20:24,919 --> 01:20:29,792
A guy out for the truth.
Well, you want the truth now, Ford?

887
01:20:29,892 --> 01:20:31,727
You're the loser.

888
01:20:31,827 --> 01:20:36,165
"America's family store"? Pathetic.

889
01:20:36,865 --> 01:20:41,401
I may be a loser, but at
least I'm not a phony.

890
01:20:45,140 --> 01:20:50,010
It's all over, Ford.
I got all the evidence right here.

891
01:20:54,549 --> 01:20:58,654
Are you... Are you crying?

892
01:20:58,754 --> 01:21:00,854
I'm broke.

893
01:21:03,124 --> 01:21:05,094
I got nothing.

894
01:21:05,894 --> 01:21:09,796
The store has been
in the red for months.

895
01:21:12,234 --> 01:21:14,203
Ford's Megastore?

896
01:21:14,303 --> 01:21:17,437
My wife, she took everything.

897
01:21:18,873 --> 01:21:21,107
I am a phony, kid.

898
01:21:22,377 --> 01:21:27,281
You're right about that.
My whole life's been an act.

899
01:21:30,551 --> 01:21:36,589
I played biff in the Ohio state
production of <i>death of a salesman.</i>

900
01:21:39,527 --> 01:21:43,129
<i>The lantern</i> said it was
an inspired performance.

901
01:21:46,434 --> 01:21:48,368
Theater...

902
01:21:50,371 --> 01:21:52,839
that was my dream.

903
01:21:55,410 --> 01:21:58,314
I... had head...

904
01:21:58,414 --> 01:22:02,382
I had head shots made up.
Look at this. Right here.

905
01:22:07,188 --> 01:22:09,592
I brought them home.

906
01:22:09,692 --> 01:22:12,761
My dad looked at them, and he just...

907
01:22:13,361 --> 01:22:15,698
he just started laughing.

908
01:22:16,298 --> 01:22:18,932
He thought I was joking.

909
01:22:21,803 --> 01:22:27,010
I was so embarrassed that
I didn't know what to do.

910
01:22:27,710 --> 01:22:31,912
So I just... I just laughed
along with him, you know?

911
01:22:36,651 --> 01:22:41,323
The irony is, I got stuck
with one role for a lifetime

912
01:22:41,623 --> 01:22:43,256
of...

913
01:22:45,860 --> 01:22:48,027
Al Ford.

914
01:22:49,097 --> 01:22:51,834
And I finally had this

915
01:22:51,934 --> 01:22:55,004
one last chance at happiness,

916
01:22:55,104 --> 01:22:56,870
and...

917
01:23:06,514 --> 01:23:09,116
She's in love with somebody else.

918
01:23:12,553 --> 01:23:14,554
Who are you talking about?

919
01:23:23,563 --> 01:23:25,565
- Greta.
- Greta?

920
01:23:28,202 --> 01:23:29,736
What?

921
01:23:34,777 --> 01:23:37,711
You... and that....

922
01:23:44,485 --> 01:23:46,420
Greta?

923
01:24:37,138 --> 01:24:39,106
Greta?

924
01:25:40,801 --> 01:25:43,906
- Clinton?
- Greta.

925
01:25:44,006 --> 01:25:45,941
Oh, my God. Are you okay?

926
01:25:47,041 --> 01:25:49,045
I think so.

927
01:25:50,445 --> 01:25:52,078
- Greta.
- Oh, God.

928
01:25:56,517 --> 01:25:57,753
Don't move.

929
01:25:58,853 --> 01:26:02,022
- Don't do it, Al.
- Shut up.

930
01:26:03,591 --> 01:26:04,893
It was you.

931
01:26:04,993 --> 01:26:08,061
You loved that cat more
than you loved me.

932
01:26:12,700 --> 01:26:15,037
Come on, Greta.

933
01:26:15,137 --> 01:26:17,539
This is... this is crazy.

934
01:26:17,639 --> 01:26:20,742
Look, let's forget about all this.

935
01:26:20,842 --> 01:26:25,180
Let's get out of here, to Brussels.
We can go, like we talked about.

936
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:27,616
Walks in the Sonian forest?

937
01:26:27,716 --> 01:26:32,369
You want me to run away with you?
You need help, Al.

938
01:26:32,470 --> 01:26:36,225
- I need you!
- You killed my cat!

939
01:26:36,325 --> 01:26:41,597
God, the cat. The cat.
The goddamned cat was a mistake. Move!

940
01:26:42,197 --> 01:26:44,831
Just put it down, Al.

941
01:26:46,900 --> 01:26:48,870
Please get out of the way.

942
01:26:49,170 --> 01:26:51,940
You've hurt her enough.

943
01:26:52,040 --> 01:26:54,943
I'm not gonna let you do it.

944
01:26:55,043 --> 01:26:57,212
I'm not moving.

945
01:26:57,612 --> 01:27:02,949
If you want to shoot somebody,
you've got to shoot me, goddamn it.

946
01:27:05,785 --> 01:27:09,689
- Oh, my God!
- He actually shot me.

947
01:27:16,298 --> 01:27:17,900
I've got you.

948
01:27:18,300 --> 01:27:21,735
Oh, my God, it's...
yeah, it's starting to hurt.

949
01:27:26,674 --> 01:27:29,011
Stop! Enough! Please!

950
01:27:29,111 --> 01:27:31,811
I don't think I can handle another one.

951
01:27:40,221 --> 01:27:42,055
Greta...

952
01:27:46,260 --> 01:27:48,094
Oh, Greta!

953
01:27:50,064 --> 01:27:53,667
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

954
01:27:55,870 --> 01:27:59,372
It's okay. It's okay.

955
01:28:16,257 --> 01:28:17,824
Al!

956
01:28:20,094 --> 01:28:21,863
Al!

957
01:28:21,963 --> 01:28:25,000
Al! Wait!

958
01:28:25,100 --> 01:28:26,900
Don't do it.

959
01:28:29,236 --> 01:28:31,907
No. No, no, don't, don't.

960
01:28:32,007 --> 01:28:35,243
It's not worth it. Don't do it.

961
01:28:36,143 --> 01:28:39,178
Plus, I don't even think
it'll actually work.

962
01:28:42,550 --> 01:28:45,819
You'll probably just end up deformed.

963
01:28:50,925 --> 01:28:52,960
I got nothing.

964
01:28:58,165 --> 01:29:00,334
Al Ford doesn't,

965
01:29:03,236 --> 01:29:05,604
but maybe you do.

966
01:29:51,188 --> 01:29:53,188
Greta...

967
01:29:54,289 --> 01:29:56,191
Greta...

968
01:29:56,791 --> 01:29:58,458
We did it.

969
01:30:03,464 --> 01:30:06,402
- We did it.
- Okay.

970
01:30:07,102 --> 01:30:09,035
We did it.

971
01:30:24,585 --> 01:30:26,552
God?

972
01:30:28,822 --> 01:30:30,492
God?

973
01:30:31,592 --> 01:30:34,293
It sucks.

974
01:30:36,597 --> 01:30:38,934
Do me a favor, kid,

975
01:30:39,034 --> 01:30:42,807
and take care of my ma.
I'm not gonna make it.

976
01:30:42,908 --> 01:30:47,574
It's just a flesh wound, Clinton. Well,
two flesh wounds. You're gonna be fine, bud.

977
01:30:49,109 --> 01:30:51,477
I found this.

978
01:30:55,584 --> 01:30:59,485
Keep it. It's yours now.

979
01:31:04,425 --> 01:31:08,497
Hoyle, I'll give this collar to you.

980
01:31:08,797 --> 01:31:12,799
Shut up, Clinton. Let's get this
guy to the hospital. Come on.

981
01:31:39,227 --> 01:31:43,431
I know you. You're Al Ford,
the guy in that commercial.

982
01:31:44,531 --> 01:31:46,198
Nah.

983
01:31:52,072 --> 01:31:53,907
Not anymore.

984
01:32:00,514 --> 01:32:03,084
Hey, let me get that for you.

985
01:32:03,184 --> 01:32:06,122
- Thank you.
- Sure.

986
01:32:07,222 --> 01:32:10,292
You know, I've kind of
always wanted a limp.

987
01:32:10,392 --> 01:32:13,094
Well, take it easy, there, Duke.

988
01:32:13,194 --> 01:32:16,531
You're just jealous because
I'm a better detective.

989
01:32:17,131 --> 01:32:20,633
You kids ready? Come on, shake a leg.

990
01:32:28,542 --> 01:32:31,878
And we're off,
in a cloud of nuts and bolts.

991
01:32:43,357 --> 01:32:45,325
Can we make a quick stop?

992
01:33:05,112 --> 01:33:08,081
Hi. Hi.

993
01:33:12,052 --> 01:33:15,588
Hey, little guy. What's your name?

994
01:33:18,392 --> 01:33:20,693
I'm Bartelby.

995
01:33:22,329 --> 01:33:24,399
"Bartleby"?

996
01:33:25,299 --> 01:33:28,336
So, how's it going, Bartelby?

997
01:33:28,436 --> 01:33:32,240
Well, you know... same old, same old.

998
01:33:32,340 --> 01:33:34,976
Life behind bars is rough, but...

999
01:33:35,076 --> 01:33:37,777
I should be up for parole soon.

1000
01:33:39,546 --> 01:33:41,748
That's great news, Bart.

1001
01:33:43,350 --> 01:33:44,987
So,

1002
01:33:46,087 --> 01:33:48,156
I know I just met you, but...

1003
01:33:48,956 --> 01:33:51,924
I kind of miss you, Bart.

1004
01:33:54,762 --> 01:33:56,729
Ditto.

1005
01:33:58,532 --> 01:34:01,300
Is that you or Bartelby talking?

1006
01:34:10,210 --> 01:34:11,713
So what are you doing here?

1007
01:34:12,613 --> 01:34:16,952
- New job. I'm the head groomer.
- Oh, really?

1008
01:34:17,052 --> 01:34:22,257
Yeah. Cutting human hair was...
just felt too easy, you know?

1009
01:34:22,657 --> 01:34:25,391
Cutting fur, that's an art, right?

1010
01:34:27,594 --> 01:34:32,298
- Is that your mom with Hoyle?
- Yeah. Yeah. Can you believe that?

1011
01:34:33,767 --> 01:34:37,539
They're actually helping me
move into my new place.

1012
01:34:37,639 --> 01:34:40,440
That's so great.
You're moving up in the world.

1013
01:34:45,946 --> 01:34:49,182
- I got a new ride.
- Oh, yeah?

1014
01:34:50,784 --> 01:34:52,318
Cool.

1015
01:34:59,427 --> 01:35:01,127
Well,

1016
01:35:03,163 --> 01:35:05,431
it was nice seeing you again.

1017
01:35:09,403 --> 01:35:11,270
Hey, do you want to take a ride?

1018
01:35:12,539 --> 01:35:14,540
Don't you have to...

1019
01:35:16,443 --> 01:35:18,646
Yeah. Yeah, of course.

1020
01:35:18,746 --> 01:35:22,181
And you're moving, so...

1021
01:35:29,689 --> 01:35:31,926
Which I think he needs.

1022
01:35:32,026 --> 01:35:35,163
- Clinton?
- Son of a bitch.

1023
01:35:36,865 --> 01:35:39,131
That a boy.
