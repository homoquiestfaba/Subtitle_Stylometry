00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:49,060
[sighs]

185
00:11:49,062 --> 00:11:50,728
[Lainey] Are my apples sick?

186
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:53,166
They're bad, Laine.
They're not worth savin'.

187
00:11:54,567 --> 00:11:55,668
[sighs]

188
00:12:00,406 --> 00:12:02,675
Okay. Stand back.

189
00:12:07,413 --> 00:12:10,383
[pounding loudly]

190
00:12:15,388 --> 00:12:16,556
[brick thuds]

191
00:12:18,291 --> 00:12:20,658
[continues pounding]

192
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:22,093
[sighs]

193
00:12:22,095 --> 00:12:23,997
[grunting]

194
00:12:35,241 --> 00:12:37,176
[exhaling helplessly]

195
00:12:45,785 --> 00:12:47,220
Lainey?

196
00:12:48,588 --> 00:12:50,087
Lainey, are you there?

197
00:12:50,089 --> 00:12:52,590
[Lainey] Yes, Momma.

198
00:12:52,592 --> 00:12:58,398
Unlock the front door and
go to the red box on the porch.

199
00:12:59,532 --> 00:13:00,831
Open it up,

200
00:13:00,833 --> 00:13:05,436
and bring me a long metal tool.

201
00:13:05,438 --> 00:13:08,973
One that has kind of
a little X on the end.

202
00:13:08,975 --> 00:13:10,541
[Lainey] A tool?

203
00:13:10,543 --> 00:13:15,146
Yes.
Just bring me what you can.

204
00:13:15,148 --> 00:13:18,683
The red box on the porch.

205
00:13:18,685 --> 00:13:21,519
Bring me anything
from inside of it.

206
00:13:21,521 --> 00:13:23,454
Okay, baby?
- [Lainey] Okay.

207
00:13:23,456 --> 00:13:25,224
[receding footsteps]

208
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:28,895
[hinges squeak]

209
00:13:30,797 --> 00:13:32,129
[Jessica sighs]

210
00:13:32,131 --> 00:13:33,164
[running footsteps]

211
00:13:33,166 --> 00:13:34,331
[Lainey] Here you go, Momma.

212
00:13:34,333 --> 00:13:35,299
[screwdriver thuds]

213
00:13:35,301 --> 00:13:36,402
[Jessica] Good job.

214
00:13:43,643 --> 00:13:48,679
Now try to get one
just like this with an X, okay?

215
00:13:48,681 --> 00:13:49,814
[Lainey] Okay.

216
00:13:49,816 --> 00:13:50,881
[receding footsteps]

217
00:13:50,883 --> 00:13:53,753
[screwdriver
pushing and scraping]

218
00:14:16,909 --> 00:14:18,909
[tricycle squeaks]

219
00:14:18,911 --> 00:14:22,213
Lainey?
Did you find the tool?

220
00:14:22,215 --> 00:14:23,681
[Lainey] Someone's here.

221
00:14:23,683 --> 00:14:24,915
Who's here?

222
00:14:24,917 --> 00:14:26,919
[Lainey] Daddy.
He took the red box.

223
00:14:30,957 --> 00:14:33,224
Is the front door locked
like I told you?

224
00:14:33,226 --> 00:14:35,726
[Lainey] Daddy's leaving.

225
00:14:35,728 --> 00:14:36,728
[cellphone cover shuts]

226
00:14:43,269 --> 00:14:45,770
Lainey, go outside and get him.

227
00:14:45,772 --> 00:14:47,140
Run!

228
00:14:48,941 --> 00:14:51,844
[door squeaks open]

229
00:14:54,981 --> 00:14:57,381
Got yourself
locked in here again, Jess.

230
00:14:57,383 --> 00:14:59,250
Why am I not surprised?
[chuckles]

231
00:14:59,252 --> 00:15:00,885
[Jessica] Thanks.

232
00:15:00,887 --> 00:15:02,052
This is yours.

233
00:15:02,054 --> 00:15:03,587
Hm. Thanks.

234
00:15:03,589 --> 00:15:05,289
- [door slams]
- [yells]

235
00:15:05,291 --> 00:15:07,258
[Rob] [laughs]
I'm just kidding.

236
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:08,259
I'm just kidding.

237
00:15:08,261 --> 00:15:09,560
Come on.
Calm down, Jess.

238
00:15:09,562 --> 00:15:13,130
Hey.
- [door closes]

239
00:15:13,132 --> 00:15:15,201
[Rob clears throat]

240
00:15:19,138 --> 00:15:20,471
You're hanging out with Sammy?

241
00:15:20,473 --> 00:15:21,974
I needed a place to stay.

242
00:15:39,592 --> 00:15:41,425
You could have stayed here
if you passed a drug test.

243
00:15:41,427 --> 00:15:42,493
You know that.

244
00:15:42,495 --> 00:15:45,930
Hey, small fry.
You're so pretty.

245
00:15:45,932 --> 00:15:47,464
How old are you?

246
00:15:47,466 --> 00:15:49,266
- Lainey.
- [Lainey] I'm not a fry.

247
00:15:49,268 --> 00:15:51,268
I'm a girl.
- [Jessica] Lainey, come here.

248
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:52,270
Come here, baby.

249
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:55,706
Come on.
Let's go to the kitchen.

250
00:15:55,708 --> 00:15:57,107
Just go finish your sandwich.
Okay, baby?

251
00:15:57,109 --> 00:15:58,676
[Rob] Hey, sweetie.

252
00:15:58,678 --> 00:16:00,144
[chuckles]
- Oh, you tracked dirt

253
00:16:00,146 --> 00:16:01,681
all over the floor, damn it.

254
00:16:03,216 --> 00:16:04,550
[Rob] Sorry.

255
00:16:07,954 --> 00:16:08,954
[Sammy clears throat]

256
00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:12,723
Where's the...
Where's the little guy?

257
00:16:12,725 --> 00:16:16,327
He's upstairs
takin' a nap before the trip.

258
00:16:16,329 --> 00:16:18,064
I don't wanna wake him.

259
00:16:20,466 --> 00:16:22,366
So, Texas, huh?

260
00:16:22,368 --> 00:16:24,134
Can't afford to stay here.

261
00:16:24,136 --> 00:16:25,137
Can't afford it.

262
00:16:26,305 --> 00:16:27,305
Too expensive.

263
00:16:30,576 --> 00:16:32,009
Your grandma
didn't leave anythin'?

264
00:16:32,011 --> 00:16:33,811
[sniffles]

265
00:16:33,813 --> 00:16:36,180
Like... like money?

266
00:16:36,182 --> 00:16:39,750
No, no.
Just the house.

267
00:16:39,752 --> 00:16:43,687
[sighs]
Look, you're both high.

268
00:16:43,689 --> 00:16:45,124
So you should go.

269
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:50,361
No, I think this is good for us.

270
00:16:50,363 --> 00:16:51,495
I'm glad you asked me in.

271
00:16:51,497 --> 00:16:53,530
[chuckles]

272
00:16:53,532 --> 00:16:55,532
This is a chance to talk.

273
00:16:55,534 --> 00:16:56,736
Talk about what?

274
00:16:58,404 --> 00:16:59,906
I figured out our problem, Jess.

275
00:17:01,941 --> 00:17:04,208
You think
you're too good for me.

276
00:17:04,210 --> 00:17:07,845
No, no, I don't. I don't.

277
00:17:07,847 --> 00:17:10,581
I just got help.

278
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:12,685
You can too.
You know, we have kids.

279
00:17:17,056 --> 00:17:18,858
You brought Sammy here.

280
00:17:20,126 --> 00:17:21,792
You know what he did
to that little girl.

281
00:17:21,794 --> 00:17:23,560
You're always paranoid
about that stuff.

282
00:17:23,562 --> 00:17:24,597
It's called projection.

283
00:17:27,233 --> 00:17:29,600
What did I do, Jessica?

284
00:17:29,602 --> 00:17:31,068
Nothing.
I was talking to Rob.

285
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:33,704
What did I do? Say it.

286
00:17:33,706 --> 00:17:35,572
I was talking to Rob, okay.
I don't know.

287
00:17:35,574 --> 00:17:36,707
[Sammy] You said my name.

288
00:17:36,709 --> 00:17:38,242
Tell me what I did.

289
00:17:38,244 --> 00:17:39,376
Go ahead.
Tell me what I did.

290
00:17:39,378 --> 00:17:40,611
What'd I do?

291
00:17:40,613 --> 00:17:41,879
- What'd I do?
- I wasn't talking to you.

292
00:17:41,881 --> 00:17:43,215
I was talking to Rob.

293
00:17:45,284 --> 00:17:49,653
Look, I've a lot to do, okay?

294
00:17:49,655 --> 00:17:50,788
So thank you for getting me out,

295
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:52,056
and I'll call you
when we get there, okay?

296
00:17:52,058 --> 00:17:53,390
Oh, she's so busy, Rob.

297
00:17:53,392 --> 00:17:54,792
She's so busy.

298
00:17:54,794 --> 00:17:58,162
I think you've just been
dismissed, buddy.

299
00:17:58,164 --> 00:17:59,463
Yeah, I-I'm tired of getting

300
00:17:59,465 --> 00:18:01,465
dismissed by you.
You know that?

301
00:18:01,467 --> 00:18:05,235
I mean... I mean,
these are my kids too.

302
00:18:05,237 --> 00:18:07,471
[Sammy] Yeah.

303
00:18:07,473 --> 00:18:09,440
- [punch thrown]
- [Jessica gasps]

304
00:18:09,442 --> 00:18:11,742
[Jessica cries]

305
00:18:11,744 --> 00:18:13,510
[Sammy snickers]

306
00:18:13,512 --> 00:18:15,946
- You haven't changed.
- [stick thuds]

307
00:18:15,948 --> 00:18:17,414
You're still weak and needy.

308
00:18:17,416 --> 00:18:18,749
What would have happened to you
if I hadn't gotten you

309
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:20,317
out of that pantry, huh?

310
00:18:20,319 --> 00:18:23,287
Out here in the boondocks,
miles from the nearest neighbor?

311
00:18:23,289 --> 00:18:26,290
You're right. I'm sorry.

312
00:18:26,292 --> 00:18:27,424
[Rob] Hm.

313
00:18:27,426 --> 00:18:29,093
[Sammy] She's lying.

314
00:18:29,095 --> 00:18:30,661
You're a liar.

315
00:18:30,663 --> 00:18:32,863
She's not sorry.
She's a liar.

316
00:18:32,865 --> 00:18:34,198
She's lying.

317
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,920
Yeah, you just pretend
I wasn't here, Jess.

318
00:18:38,104 --> 00:18:39,937
I'll tell you what,
you don't have to pretend.

319
00:18:39,939 --> 00:18:42,439
I'll put things back the way
they were before I got here.

320
00:18:42,441 --> 00:18:44,508
[gasps]
Rob! Stop!

321
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:46,844
[Rob] This is you without me!

322
00:18:46,846 --> 00:18:49,680
- Rob! Stop! Stop!
- [Sammy laughs]

323
00:18:49,682 --> 00:18:51,115
- [Rob] Come here.
- Rob, let me go.

324
00:18:51,117 --> 00:18:54,318
[Rob grunting]

325
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,386
- [Jessica] Rob! [indistinct]
- [Rob] Come here.

326
00:18:55,388 --> 00:18:57,454
Rob. Rob!

327
00:18:57,456 --> 00:18:59,490
This is you without me.

328
00:18:59,492 --> 00:19:00,524
- Rob!
- [thud as Jessica falls]

329
00:19:00,526 --> 00:19:02,126
[Rob] I'm always
saving your silly ass!

330
00:19:02,128 --> 00:19:03,568
- [Jessica] No!
- [door slams loudly]

331

334
00:19:09,635 --> 00:19:11,368
Rob, what are you doing?

335
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:12,738
[SammYou are learning.

336
00:19:15,041 --> 00:19:16,540
[Lainey]
Mommy, are you in there?

337
00:19:16,542 --> 00:19:18,509
Lainey,
go upstairs to my bedroom

338
00:19:18,511 --> 00:19:19,743
and lock the door.

339
00:19:19,745 --> 00:19:21,378
It's the little button
on the door, you turn it.

340
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:22,513
Do you understand?

341
00:19:22,515 --> 00:19:23,981
[Lainey] Why are you in there?

342
00:19:23,983 --> 00:19:26,817
Just go. Now!

343
00:19:26,819 --> 00:19:28,485

Good girl.

347
00:19:36,228 --> 00:19:37,995
Rob.

348
00:19:37,997 --> 00:19:39,663

[Jessica] God.

361
00:20:04,423 --> 00:20:05,722
[Rob] You're gonna have a lot of
time in there to think.

00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:09,693
You've gotten
a little too full of yourself.

364
00:20:09,695 --> 00:20:11,228
[hammering continues]

365
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:13,730
Rob, you're high.

366
00:20:13,732 --> 00:20:15,599
You're not thinking straight.

367
00:20:15,601 --> 00:20:17,034
- [Sammy] Rob. Rob.
- Don't do this.

368
00:20:17,036 --> 00:20:18,102
[hammering continues]

369
00:20:18,104 --> 00:20:20,070
[Sammy]
Should I grab the kids? Huh?

370
00:20:20,072 --> 00:20:21,538
We can bring them to my place.

371
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:22,606
Let's move.
- [Jessica sobbing]

372
00:20:22,608 --> 00:20:27,111
Don't you touch my kids,
you asshole!

373
00:20:27,113 --> 00:20:31,081
Rob, he's a child molester!

374
00:20:31,083 --> 00:20:33,550
Lainey! Lock the door!

375
00:20:33,552 --> 00:20:35,052
Turn the button!

376
00:20:35,054 --> 00:20:36,987
[tense music]

377
00:20:36,989 --> 00:20:41,959
Rob, please don't let him
touch our kids.

378
00:20:41,961 --> 00:20:44,761
Please leave them. Please.

379
00:20:44,763 --> 00:20:46,630
[Rob] Be careful with this.

380
00:20:46,632 --> 00:20:48,432
It's pharmaceutical grade.

381
00:20:48,434 --> 00:20:51,001
I'll come back when you're back
to your old self.

382
00:20:51,003 --> 00:20:56,473
Rob!
Don't... don't take the kids.

383
00:20:56,475 --> 00:20:57,977
Please leave them.

384
00:20:59,812 --> 00:21:01,745
Rob?
- [door slams shut]

385
00:21:01,747 --> 00:21:02,747
Lainey?

386
00:21:03,782 --> 00:21:06,583
Lainey, are you there?

387
00:21:06,585 --> 00:21:08,752
Mommy loves you.

388
00:21:08,754 --> 00:21:09,853
[crying]

389
00:21:09,855 --> 00:21:11,121
Rob.

390
00:21:11,123 --> 00:21:12,089
[car door closes]

391
00:21:12,091 --> 00:21:13,690
[car engine revving]

392
00:21:13,692 --> 00:21:14,927
Rob!

393
00:21:16,295 --> 00:21:19,331
[sobbing]

394
00:21:29,942 --> 00:21:32,276
[thunder rumbles]

395
00:21:32,278 --> 00:21:35,546
[emotional music]

396
00:21:35,548 --> 00:21:38,784
[creaking]

397
00:22:06,011 --> 00:22:08,545
[approaching footsteps]

398
00:22:08,547 --> 00:22:10,180
[door latch clicks]

399
00:22:10,182 --> 00:22:12,683
[approaching footsteps]

400
00:22:12,685 --> 00:22:14,518
Lainey?

401
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:16,253
[approaching footsteps]

402
00:22:16,255 --> 00:22:17,256
Lainey?

403
00:22:18,557 --> 00:22:19,990
Lainey, is that you?

404
00:22:19,992 --> 00:22:21,158
Are you here?

405
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:24,094
[running footsteps]

406
00:22:24,096 --> 00:22:27,664
[Lainey] Mommy,
why are you in there?

407
00:22:27,666 --> 00:22:29,168
I got stuck again.

408
00:22:31,237 --> 00:22:34,204
Lainey, where's Mason?
Is he okay?

409
00:22:34,206 --> 00:22:35,839
[Lainey] He's sleeping.

410
00:22:35,841 --> 00:22:38,375
I pushed the button on the door
and sang the ABCs to him

411
00:22:38,377 --> 00:22:40,246
until he falled asleep.

412
00:22:42,114 --> 00:22:44,183
You did a good job, Laine.

413
00:22:46,518 --> 00:22:49,586
[breaths deeply]

414
00:22:49,588 --> 00:22:53,192
Okay, Lainey.
Listen very carefully.

415
00:22:55,261 --> 00:22:57,594
I need you
to go lock the front door.

416
00:22:57,596 --> 00:22:59,529
You already know
how to unlock it.

417
00:22:59,531 --> 00:23:02,899
You just turn that little
metal thing the other way.

418
00:23:02,901 --> 00:23:04,368
[Lainey] Okay.

419
00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:06,672
[receding footsteps]

420
00:23:10,109 --> 00:23:11,310
[door latch clicks]

421
00:23:15,614 --> 00:23:17,983
[running footsteps]

422
00:23:20,753 --> 00:23:23,887
[approaching footsteps]

423
00:23:23,889 --> 00:23:25,989
I turned the lock.

424
00:23:25,991 --> 00:23:27,793
You're a smart girl, Laine.

425
00:23:28,894 --> 00:23:29,894
Okay.

426
00:23:31,463 --> 00:23:33,997
Now, what did Daddy
do to the door?

427
00:23:33,999 --> 00:23:35,932
Can you tell me what you see?

428
00:23:35,934 --> 00:23:38,669
[Lainey] Daddy messed it up.
It's broken.

429
00:23:38,671 --> 00:23:40,270
I know, baby.
But what...

430
00:23:40,272 --> 00:23:42,005
What did he nail over it?

431
00:23:42,007 --> 00:23:43,575
[Lainey] All of Nana's wood.

432
00:23:45,244 --> 00:23:49,214
The two-by-fours. Crap.

433
00:23:50,482 --> 00:23:52,651
Um, [clicks tongue]

434
00:23:56,088 --> 00:23:59,856
Okay, Lainey, listen.

435
00:23:59,858 --> 00:24:03,827
My purse... no, not my purse.

436
00:24:03,829 --> 00:24:07,931
My cell...
My cell phone is on the floor

437
00:24:07,933 --> 00:24:09,199
in the livin' room.

438
00:24:09,201 --> 00:24:11,668
I need you to go get it
and bring it here.

439
00:24:11,670 --> 00:24:13,205
[Lainey]
Mommy, please come out.

440
00:24:17,209 --> 00:24:19,476
I need to call 9-1-1.
Just go get my phone.

441
00:24:19,478 --> 00:24:21,144
[Lainey] What's 9-1-1?

442
00:24:21,146 --> 00:24:23,847
Just get the phone, please.

443
00:24:23,849 --> 00:24:25,549
[receding footsteps]

444
00:24:25,551 --> 00:24:27,384
[sighs]

445
00:24:27,386 --> 00:24:30,520
[wind rattling and whooshing]

446
00:24:30,522 --> 00:24:32,291
Are you sure
you looked everywhere?

447
00:24:33,459 --> 00:24:35,025
It was on the floor.

448
00:24:35,027 --> 00:24:36,762
[Lainey]
Mommy, I can't find it.

449
00:24:39,732 --> 00:24:41,832
And my purse is gone too?
Are you sure?

450
00:24:41,834 --> 00:24:44,368
[Lainey] It's not there.

451
00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:46,970
[whispering] Rob, you took it.

452
00:24:46,972 --> 00:24:48,071
Dammit.

453
00:24:48,073 --> 00:24:50,073
[Lainey] Mommy, come out.
I have to pee.

454
00:24:50,075 --> 00:24:52,676
You need to come with me.

455
00:24:52,678 --> 00:24:54,010
[breathing deeply]

456
00:24:54,012 --> 00:24:56,980
[Mason crying in the distance]

457
00:24:56,982 --> 00:24:59,918
[wind whooshing]

458
00:25:01,987 --> 00:25:03,288
Lainey, listen.

459
00:25:04,857 --> 00:25:06,189
It's time for Mason's bottle.

460
00:25:06,191 --> 00:25:07,326
There's one in the fridge.

461
00:25:08,594 --> 00:25:11,027
And he needs his
diaper changed too,

462
00:25:11,029 --> 00:25:12,195
and Mommy can't help him.

463
00:25:12,197 --> 00:25:14,264
[Lainey] Mommy, I have to pee!

464
00:25:14,266 --> 00:25:17,834
Then go pee!
I can't go with you.

465
00:25:17,836 --> 00:25:20,070
I'm stuck in the pantry!

466
00:25:20,072 --> 00:25:21,171
[Lainey] I miss Nana!

467
00:25:21,173 --> 00:25:22,241
I want Nana.

468
00:25:38,190 --> 00:25:39,358
I'm sorry, baby.

469
00:25:41,059 --> 00:25:42,261
I'm sorry.

470
00:25:44,596 --> 00:25:46,098
Mommy wasn't nice.

471
00:25:51,203 --> 00:25:52,771
I miss Nana too.

472
00:25:55,474 --> 00:25:57,643
But we have to take care
of each other now.

473
00:25:58,644 --> 00:25:59,645
Okay?

474
00:26:02,881 --> 00:26:05,784
[urine dripping]

475
00:26:09,221 --> 00:26:11,056
[Lainey] Sorry, Mommy.
Please don't get mad.

476
00:26:17,229 --> 00:26:20,165
[emotional music]

477
00:26:23,001 --> 00:26:26,736
[clattering]

478
00:26:26,738 --> 00:26:28,874
[sighing deeply]

479
00:26:53,298 --> 00:26:55,966
[approaching footsteps]

480
00:26:55,968 --> 00:26:58,101
[Lainey]
Mommy, Mason pooped.

481
00:26:58,103 --> 00:27:00,670
[whispers] Oh, crap.

482
00:27:00,672 --> 00:27:02,772
He waited till now?

483
00:27:02,774 --> 00:27:04,641
[sighing deeply]

484
00:27:04,643 --> 00:27:09,379
Okay, Lainey, you remember
how Mommy does it?

485
00:27:09,381 --> 00:27:12,315
You take the wipes
from the diaper bag.

486
00:27:12,317 --> 00:27:14,551
Use those to clean him.

487
00:27:14,553 --> 00:27:16,520
And then throw those away
with the diaper

488
00:27:16,522 --> 00:27:19,122
and wash your hands after.

489
00:27:19,124 --> 00:27:20,223
You got it?

490
00:27:20,225 --> 00:27:21,191
[Lainey] I know what to do.

491
00:27:21,193 --> 00:27:22,292
[receding footsteps]

492
00:27:22,294 --> 00:27:24,828
He's heavy, okay?
He's not a doll.

493
00:27:24,830 --> 00:27:25,931
[Lainey] I know.

494
00:27:27,065 --> 00:27:29,968
[emotional music continues]

495
00:27:46,018 --> 00:27:47,183
[jar lid thuds]

496
00:27:47,185 --> 00:27:50,153
[thunder rumbles]

497
00:27:50,155 --> 00:27:53,158
[♪]

498
00:28:06,004 --> 00:28:07,906
Mommy, I'm hungry.

499
00:28:17,349 --> 00:28:19,349
- [paper plate slides in]
- [Lainey] I finished it.

500
00:28:26,358 --> 00:28:28,594
[Jessica] I'm gonna need you
to feed Mason now, okay?

501
00:28:30,362 --> 00:28:34,064
There's a plastic spoon
in the diaper bag.

502
00:28:34,066 --> 00:28:35,500
Use that to feed the baby.

503
00:28:36,768 --> 00:28:38,034
And make sure you sit him up.

504
00:28:38,036 --> 00:28:39,204
Okay?

505
00:28:46,878 --> 00:28:50,113
[Lainey] Mommy, I'm still
hungry and I'm thirsty.

506
00:28:50,115 --> 00:28:52,082
You can drink water
from the sink.

507
00:28:52,084 --> 00:28:54,651
Just use the cup there.

508
00:28:54,653 --> 00:28:56,888
[Lainey] I don't like water.
I want juice.

509
00:28:59,291 --> 00:29:00,991
Well, I packed up all our food

510
00:29:00,993 --> 00:29:03,293
and juice box is in the car.

511
00:29:03,295 --> 00:29:06,164
We need the keys
and they're in my purse.

512
00:29:08,567 --> 00:29:10,600
And you shouldn't be drinking
juice all the time anyway.

513
00:29:10,602 --> 00:29:11,935
It's bad for you.

514
00:29:11,937 --> 00:29:13,737
[Lainey] I'm thirsty for juice!

515
00:29:13,739 --> 00:29:16,773
Drink water!

516
00:29:16,775 --> 00:29:18,543
[footsteps going up the stairs]

517
00:29:22,748 --> 00:29:24,149
Don't let him choke.

518
00:29:25,283 --> 00:29:26,718
Sit him up.
Do you hear me?

519
00:29:48,774 --> 00:29:49,839
[exhales softly]

520
00:29:49,841 --> 00:29:51,443
[Lainey]
Mommy, mommy, wake up.

521
00:29:55,347 --> 00:29:57,213
[Jessica]
It's time for bed, Laine.

522
00:29:57,215 --> 00:30:00,183
No, no.
Please come out. I'm scared.

523
00:30:00,185 --> 00:30:02,452
[Jessica]
I can't get out, baby.

524
00:30:02,454 --> 00:30:04,487
You know that.

525
00:30:04,489 --> 00:30:06,489
Or else I'd come tuck you in.

526
00:30:06,491 --> 00:30:07,557
[Lainey] You can get out.

527
00:30:07,559 --> 00:30:09,461
You just need to try harder.

528
00:30:12,130 --> 00:30:14,564
I'm tryin' my best.

529
00:30:14,566 --> 00:30:16,435
[Lainey]
A monster's gonna grab me.

530
00:30:21,873 --> 00:30:23,707
[Jessica]
There's no monsters, Laine.

531
00:30:23,709 --> 00:30:25,277
It's in the dark.

532
00:30:26,511 --> 00:30:28,046
Mason needs you.

533
00:30:29,181 --> 00:30:30,513
He's all alone.

534
00:30:30,515 --> 00:30:32,117
I wanna stay here with you.

535
00:30:33,685 --> 00:30:37,187
[sighs]
It's cold down here.

536
00:30:37,189 --> 00:30:39,823
The heat's on upstairs.

537
00:30:39,825 --> 00:30:42,926
Just shove a towel under
the window where it won't shut.

538
00:30:42,928 --> 00:30:45,395
- And put on socks.
- I'm not cold.

539
00:30:45,397 --> 00:30:47,831
[Lainey]
It's just for one night.

540
00:30:47,833 --> 00:30:49,332
I'll be out tomorrow.

541
00:30:49,334 --> 00:30:50,802
Daddy will come back.

542
00:30:52,337 --> 00:30:53,839
[Lainey] Daddy's bad.

543
00:30:58,877 --> 00:31:01,111
Just go to bed, baby.

544
00:31:01,113 --> 00:31:03,379
Okay?

545
00:31:03,381 --> 00:31:04,916
Go on.

546
00:31:09,888 --> 00:31:12,858
[clattering and clanking]

547
00:31:19,698 --> 00:31:21,600
[tricycle rattling]

548
00:31:25,403 --> 00:31:26,605
[Lainey] All done.

549
00:31:28,473 --> 00:31:29,708
Good girl.

550
00:31:34,079 --> 00:31:36,214
Okay, time to feed Mason.

551
00:31:37,883 --> 00:31:39,582
[jar thuds]

552
00:31:39,584 --> 00:31:40,786
Be careful, okay?

553
00:31:42,154 --> 00:31:44,554
Here you go.

554
00:31:44,556 --> 00:31:46,089
- [tricycle thumping away]
- [incidental music]

555
00:31:46,091 --> 00:31:48,291
Dammit.

556
00:31:48,293 --> 00:31:49,561
[grunting softly]

557
00:31:51,897 --> 00:31:53,031
[gasping]

558
00:32:33,972 --> 00:32:35,438
Lainey?

559
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,873
[Lainey] Yes, Momma.

560
00:32:36,875 --> 00:32:40,176
When the baby falls asleep,
I need your help!

561
00:32:40,178 --> 00:32:41,511
[Lainey] Okay.

562
00:32:41,513 --> 00:32:43,046
Here you go.
- [small branch slides]

563
00:32:43,048 --> 00:32:45,315
[Jessica]
That won't work, Laine.

564
00:32:45,317 --> 00:32:47,684
I need somethin' metal.

565
00:32:47,686 --> 00:32:50,653
A tool, so I can chip away
at the wood.

566
00:32:50,655 --> 00:32:52,322
[Lainey] It's a strong stick.

567
00:32:52,324 --> 00:32:53,358
[Jessica] Keep lookin'.

568
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:56,928
[tricycle squeaking]

569
00:32:58,296 --> 00:33:00,663
[pebble thuds]

570
00:33:00,665 --> 00:33:01,965
[toy car thuds]

571
00:33:01,967 --> 00:33:03,967
[plastic fork thuds]
and crayon thuds]

572
00:33:03,969 --> 00:33:06,069
Mommy can't break through a wall

573
00:33:06,071 --> 00:33:08,805
with a green crayon, Laine.

574
00:33:08,807 --> 00:33:10,108
You know that.

575
00:33:11,309 --> 00:33:14,010
I need somethin' hard.

576
00:33:14,012 --> 00:33:16,312
I need somethin' metal.

577
00:33:16,314 --> 00:33:17,847
I told you that already!

578
00:33:17,849 --> 00:33:20,516
[Lainey cries loudly]

579
00:33:20,518 --> 00:33:21,720
[Jessica sighing deeply]

580
00:33:23,521 --> 00:33:25,290
[Lainey cries loudly]

581
00:33:27,525 --> 00:33:30,495
[Lainey continues crying]

582
00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:32,964
I'm sorry, Lainey.

583
00:33:34,866 --> 00:33:36,468
I'm sorry for yellin' at you.

584
00:33:37,936 --> 00:33:41,504
You're doing the best job.
You really are.

585
00:33:41,506 --> 00:33:44,442
[breaths deeply]

586
00:33:48,546 --> 00:33:50,282
[sniffles]

587
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:57,422
I'm a bad mom, okay?

588
00:34:01,192 --> 00:34:03,428
I just didn't know how to do it.
I never learned.

589
00:34:04,763 --> 00:34:07,530
[sighing deeply]
And you don't know this,

590
00:34:07,532 --> 00:34:12,635
but I was just too young
when you came around

591
00:34:12,637 --> 00:34:15,805
and I wasn't ready for all this.

592
00:34:15,807 --> 00:34:22,879
[crying] And then, I left you
alone for so long

593
00:34:22,881 --> 00:34:24,049
when I was sick.

594
00:34:26,551 --> 00:34:28,620
I messed up real bad.

595
00:34:30,288 --> 00:34:31,990
But I'm tryin'.

596
00:34:33,591 --> 00:34:36,659
[sobbing]

597
00:34:36,661 --> 00:34:42,765
Just promise me
that you're not gonna grow up

598
00:34:42,767 --> 00:34:46,171
and hate me like I hated my mom.

599
00:34:47,939 --> 00:34:49,572
[exhales]

600
00:34:49,574 --> 00:34:51,941
[sniffling]

601
00:34:51,943 --> 00:34:53,311
[exhales]

602
00:34:55,814 --> 00:34:57,334
- [door latch clicks]
- [hinges squeak]

603
00:34:59,250 --> 00:35:00,917
Lainey?

604
00:35:00,919 --> 00:35:04,454
[wind whooshing]

605
00:35:04,456 --> 00:35:05,824
Lainey, are you here?

606
00:35:06,925 --> 00:35:07,993
Laine?

607
00:35:10,528 --> 00:35:11,661
[clattering]

608
00:35:11,663 --> 00:35:13,231
Who's here, Laine?

609
00:35:14,199 --> 00:35:15,266
Answer me.

610
00:35:17,969 --> 00:35:20,269
[approaching footsteps]

611
00:35:20,271 --> 00:35:21,938
[screwdriver thudding]

612
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:23,506
[Lainey]
I found it under the leaves.

613
00:35:23,508 --> 00:35:25,608
It's Daddy's tool.

614
00:35:25,610 --> 00:35:26,809
He lost it.

615
00:35:26,811 --> 00:35:30,313
Good job, baby.
You did it.

616
00:35:30,315 --> 00:35:32,482
This is exactly what I needed.

617
00:35:32,484 --> 00:35:34,684
[Lainey] I did it.

618
00:35:34,686 --> 00:35:36,552
You are a good girl, Laine.

619
00:35:36,554 --> 00:35:38,321
I love you.

620
00:35:38,323 --> 00:35:40,123
[Lainey] I'm gonna go
take care of Mason.

621
00:35:40,125 --> 00:35:43,626
[receding footsteps]

622
00:35:43,628 --> 00:35:45,862
[sighs]

623
00:35:45,864 --> 00:35:48,197
I'm gonna get out of here.

624
00:35:48,199 --> 00:35:49,699
Just sit tight!

625
00:35:49,701 --> 00:35:52,704
[hitting on tiles]

626
00:35:56,207 --> 00:35:59,210
[incidental music]

627
00:36:18,997 --> 00:36:20,131
[brick thuds]

628
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:38,416
[panting]

629
00:36:40,251 --> 00:36:43,688
Lainey, you there?

630
00:36:46,024 --> 00:36:47,692
I'm almost done.

631
00:36:49,727 --> 00:36:53,763
Maybe a few more hours
I can crawl out under the house.

632
00:36:53,765 --> 00:36:57,400
[distant footsteps]

633
00:36:57,402 --> 00:36:59,035
What's going on up there?

634
00:36:59,037 --> 00:37:00,269
[Lainey] Mason!

635
00:37:00,271 --> 00:37:02,071
- [loud thump]
- [Mason crying]

636
00:37:02,073 --> 00:37:04,309
Lainey, what happened?

637
00:37:06,578 --> 00:37:08,578
[approaching footsteps]

638
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:10,146
[Lainey] I dropped the baby.

639
00:37:10,148 --> 00:37:13,149
- Oh, god. Oh, god.
- [Mason crying]

640
00:37:13,151 --> 00:37:16,953
[Lainey] He was trying to
crawl down the stairs.

641
00:37:16,955 --> 00:37:19,055
- It's okay, it's okay.
- [Lainey] Mommy, I'm sorry.

642
00:37:19,057 --> 00:37:20,590
It's okay. It's okay.

643
00:37:20,592 --> 00:37:24,894
You need to pick him up and
hold him until he stops cryin'.

644
00:37:24,896 --> 00:37:28,764
He's alone
and he's scared right now.

645
00:37:28,766 --> 00:37:31,035
[Lainey] He wants milk
but it's all gone.

646
00:37:33,171 --> 00:37:35,938
[exhales]
You need to make him a bottle.

647
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:37,240
You remember how Mommy does it.

648
00:37:37,242 --> 00:37:40,676
It's three scoops of formula,
the powder in the can.

649
00:37:40,678 --> 00:37:42,912
You fill it up with water,
put the nipple on tight,

650
00:37:42,914 --> 00:37:44,413
and shake it.

651
00:37:44,415 --> 00:37:46,249
[Lainey] Okay.

652
00:37:46,251 --> 00:37:47,416
You can do it.

653
00:37:47,418 --> 00:37:50,321
[Mason crying continues]

654
00:37:52,624 --> 00:37:54,257
[banging]

655
00:37:54,259 --> 00:37:56,928
[Jessica grunting hard]

656
00:38:02,967 --> 00:38:05,937
[thudding and clattering]

657
00:38:22,453 --> 00:38:23,621
Lainey,

658
00:38:25,456 --> 00:38:27,458
almost there.

659
00:38:29,627 --> 00:38:30,795
I can do this.

660
00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:33,630
It's gonna be fine.

661
00:38:40,738 --> 00:38:42,040
Laine?

662
00:38:45,143 --> 00:38:48,046
[tricycle squeaking]

663
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:50,481
[Lainey] Mommy, someone's here.

664
00:38:52,984 --> 00:38:54,917
Who's here?

665
00:38:54,919 --> 00:38:56,152
Is it Daddy?

666
00:38:56,154 --> 00:38:57,956
[Lainey] It's that man
he called me a fry.

667
00:38:59,857 --> 00:39:01,657
Okay.

668
00:39:01,659 --> 00:39:04,193
Lainey, please tell me
you locked the front door.

669
00:39:04,195 --> 00:39:06,529
[Lainey] He's coming in.

670
00:39:06,531 --> 00:39:08,197
[Sammy] Hello?

671
00:39:08,199 --> 00:39:10,833
Hello?

672
00:39:10,835 --> 00:39:11,834
Anybody home?

673
00:39:11,836 --> 00:39:13,736
Lainey,
run upstairs to the bedroom

674
00:39:13,738 --> 00:39:14,937
and lock the door.

675
00:39:14,939 --> 00:39:16,339
[Lainey] Maybe that man
can get you out.

676
00:39:16,341 --> 00:39:18,708
He's bad, Laine. Run!

677
00:39:18,710 --> 00:39:21,844
[tricycle squeaks away]

678
00:39:21,846 --> 00:39:24,013
[receding footsteps]

679
00:39:24,015 --> 00:39:25,181
[door closes]

680
00:39:25,183 --> 00:39:28,184
[wind whooshing]

681
00:39:28,186 --> 00:39:29,754
[door closes]

682
00:39:31,556 --> 00:39:32,790
[Sammy] Hello?

683
00:39:37,195 --> 00:39:38,863
Anybody home?

684
00:39:40,698 --> 00:39:41,799
Little girl?

685
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:44,936
[measured footsteps]

686
00:39:48,406 --> 00:39:50,375
[nervous breaths]

687
00:39:51,743 --> 00:39:54,679
[approaching footsteps]

688
00:39:58,916 --> 00:40:00,852
[hinges squeak]

689
00:40:03,588 --> 00:40:05,888
[SammJessica?

690
00:40:05,890 --> 00:40:07,056
Where's Rob?

691
00:40:07,058 --> 00:40:08,224
[Sammy scoffs]

692
00:40:08,226 --> 00:40:09,294
Is he with you?

693
00:40:11,396 --> 00:40:13,929
[Sammy] Rob is busy.

694
00:40:13,931 --> 00:40:17,967
So I thought I'd come
and babysit for you.

695
00:40:17,969 --> 00:40:20,102
[Jessica]
We don't need a babysitter.

696
00:40:20,104 --> 00:40:21,570
I'm fine.

697
00:40:21,572 --> 00:40:23,105
[Sammy] Oh.

698
00:40:23,107 --> 00:40:25,174
Please leave my house.

699
00:40:25,176 --> 00:40:27,410
[Sammy] You really
like to dismiss people,

700
00:40:27,412 --> 00:40:28,813
don't you, Jessica?

701
00:40:30,682 --> 00:40:31,749
You know.

702
00:40:34,452 --> 00:40:35,753
Your daughter.

703
00:40:37,121 --> 00:40:39,088
[whispering] she's very pretty.

704
00:40:39,090 --> 00:40:40,491
Very pretty.

705
00:40:41,959 --> 00:40:43,159
Where is she?

706
00:40:43,161 --> 00:40:44,627
She upstairs?

707
00:40:44,629 --> 00:40:48,164
Rob's gonna be pretty pissed at
you if you mess with his kids.

708
00:40:48,166 --> 00:40:50,032
[Sammy] I thought I saw
her go upstairs, Jessica.

709
00:40:50,034 --> 00:40:51,867
- Is that where she is?
- Stay away from them.

710
00:40:51,869 --> 00:40:57,440
[Sammy] Rob owes me money.

711
00:40:57,442 --> 00:41:00,309
And I'm here to collect payment,
Jessica.

712
00:41:00,311 --> 00:41:02,111
[Jessica gasping]

713
00:41:02,113 --> 00:41:03,479
No, no, stop!

714
00:41:03,481 --> 00:41:06,115
Wait! Wait, wait, wait.

715
00:41:06,117 --> 00:41:08,150
- [Sammy] Little girl?
- [Jessica sighing in distress]

716
00:41:08,152 --> 00:41:09,285
[Jessica sobbing]

717
00:41:09,287 --> 00:41:10,619
[Sammy] Little girl?

718
00:41:10,621 --> 00:41:11,620
Where are you?

719
00:41:11,622 --> 00:41:14,156
[climbing footsteps]

720
00:41:14,158 --> 00:41:17,793
Where are you, little girl?

721
00:41:17,795 --> 00:41:19,128
I have Rob's meth!

722
00:41:19,130 --> 00:41:20,363
[footsteps halt]

723
00:41:20,365 --> 00:41:22,433
It's yours.
I haven't used it.

724
00:41:23,868 --> 00:41:26,237
I got probably
three grams down here.

725
00:41:28,706 --> 00:41:30,840
Come on.
Don't let it go to waste.

726
00:41:30,842 --> 00:41:32,377
Rob's just gonna take it back.

727
00:41:34,011 --> 00:41:36,981
[approaching footsteps]

728
00:41:44,355 --> 00:41:47,392
[panting]

729
00:41:53,331 --> 00:41:57,600
[Sammy] He gave you three grams
and he owes me money?

730
00:41:57,602 --> 00:42:00,403
Yeah. And it's
all yours if you want it.

731
00:42:00,405 --> 00:42:01,704
It's all yours.

732
00:42:01,706 --> 00:42:03,539
[Sammy] Okay.

733
00:42:03,541 --> 00:42:05,009
Send it under the door.

734
00:42:06,344 --> 00:42:08,411
Go ahead.
- [Jessica] Let me out.

735
00:42:08,413 --> 00:42:10,179
And it's all yours.

736
00:42:10,181 --> 00:42:11,213
[Sammy] Let you out?

737
00:42:11,215 --> 00:42:13,549
[laughs]

738
00:42:13,551 --> 00:42:16,619
No can do, Jessica. No.

739
00:42:16,621 --> 00:42:19,722
I don't get involved
in domestic disputes.

740
00:42:19,724 --> 00:42:22,358
Well, call the police.

741
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:25,694
Or let me
use your phone, please.

742
00:42:25,696 --> 00:42:29,198
[Sammy]
Not calling the police.

743
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:32,435
Not getting you out.

744
00:42:32,437 --> 00:42:35,204
Send it under the door, Jessica.

745
00:42:35,206 --> 00:42:38,207
If I give you the meth,
will you leave us alone?

746
00:42:38,209 --> 00:42:40,945
You have to leave the house,
and you can't come back.

747
00:42:42,747 --> 00:42:44,213
[Sammy] Of course, Jessica.

748
00:42:44,215 --> 00:42:46,184
I'll go. I'll leave.

749
00:42:47,885 --> 00:42:49,020
You have my word.

750
00:42:51,422 --> 00:42:52,857
Put it under the door.

751
00:42:54,091 --> 00:42:57,061
[Jessica whimpers]

752
00:43:11,909 --> 00:43:14,879
[♪]

753
00:43:18,749 --> 00:43:20,051
[SammJessica?

754
00:43:21,819 --> 00:43:24,088
Push it under the door, Jessica.

755
00:43:26,157 --> 00:43:27,756
Jessica?
- Sorry. Sorry.

756
00:43:27,758 --> 00:43:30,428
I just... I'm injured.

757
00:43:32,163 --> 00:43:34,899
I'm... I'm too weak
to get close enough.

758
00:43:36,601 --> 00:43:39,034
Reach under the door
and I'll drop it in your hand.

759
00:43:39,036 --> 00:43:40,970
[Sammy]
You sound fine to me, Jessica.

760
00:43:40,972 --> 00:43:43,105
Just push it under the door.

761
00:43:43,107 --> 00:43:44,373
I can't reach that far.

762
00:43:44,375 --> 00:43:46,108
[Sammy] Push it under the door,
Jessica.

763
00:43:46,110 --> 00:43:48,310
[Jessica] I-I'm stuck... I'm stuck
over here on the other end.

764
00:43:48,312 --> 00:43:49,747
I can't move much.

765
00:43:52,783 --> 00:43:54,051
Have you tried it yet?

766
00:43:56,487 --> 00:43:57,955
Rob said it's good stuff.

767
00:44:02,693 --> 00:44:03,659
If you can't decide,

768
00:44:03,661 --> 00:44:04,727
I'm gonna dump it out.

769
00:44:04,729 --> 00:44:07,863
[Sammy] Hey, hey. Hold on.

770
00:44:07,865 --> 00:44:10,966
[Jessica breathes heavily]

771
00:44:10,968 --> 00:44:13,471
[Sammy grunts]

772
00:44:15,306 --> 00:44:16,306
Okay.

773
00:44:19,644 --> 00:44:20,644
Where is it?

774
00:44:21,846 --> 00:44:22,947
Can you reach my hand?

775
00:44:24,248 --> 00:44:25,714
Almost.

776
00:44:25,716 --> 00:44:29,086
Just... just can you stretch out
a little bit more?

777
00:44:30,688 --> 00:44:32,123
[Sammy groans]

778
00:44:36,027 --> 00:44:37,359
Okay.

779
00:44:37,361 --> 00:44:39,662
That's as far as I can go.

780
00:44:39,664 --> 00:44:41,330
Can you reach my hand?

781
00:44:41,332 --> 00:44:43,566
I can just reach you.

782
00:44:43,568 --> 00:44:45,469
[Sammy]
Okay, drop it in my hand.

783
00:44:47,872 --> 00:44:48,940
Here it comes.

784
00:44:50,575 --> 00:44:53,275
[shrieks]
- [Sammy screams in pain]

785
00:44:53,277 --> 00:44:54,843
Take it out!
Take it out!

786
00:44:54,845 --> 00:44:55,878
[Jessica screams]

787
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:57,613
What did you do?

788
00:44:57,615 --> 00:45:00,616
[Jessica pounding loudly]

789
00:45:00,618 --> 00:45:01,850
[cries]

790
00:45:01,852 --> 00:45:03,552
Take it out!

791
00:45:03,554 --> 00:45:05,521
Take it out, you bitch!

792
00:45:05,523 --> 00:45:07,022
What did you do to me?

793
00:45:07,024 --> 00:45:08,424
Get it out of my hand.

794
00:45:08,426 --> 00:45:09,758
I swear. I'm getting out...

795
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:11,860
[Jessica] You'll get out
when I get out.

796
00:45:11,862 --> 00:45:15,698
Keep your other hand out of here
or I will cut it off!

797
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:18,701
I'm gonna gut your kids
in front of you. you whore.

798
00:45:18,703 --> 00:45:20,636
Get it out of my hand.

799
00:45:20,638 --> 00:45:23,372
Get it out of my hand,
you bitch!

800
00:45:23,374 --> 00:45:25,207
Get it out!

801
00:45:25,209 --> 00:45:26,575
What did you do?

802
00:45:26,577 --> 00:45:29,578
Get it out.
Get it out!

803
00:45:29,580 --> 00:45:31,213
Get it out now!

804
00:45:31,215 --> 00:45:34,049
[sobs] Oh, please.

805
00:45:34,051 --> 00:45:35,353
Please, okay.

806
00:45:38,923 --> 00:45:40,589
Get it out now!

807
00:45:40,591 --> 00:45:42,893
Get it out! Get it out!

808
00:46:05,282 --> 00:46:08,751
What are you doing in there?

809
00:46:08,753 --> 00:46:10,986
It smells like liquor.

810
00:46:10,988 --> 00:46:12,588
Wow.

811
00:46:12,590 --> 00:46:13,589
[inhales deeply]

812
00:46:13,591 --> 00:46:16,158
All liquored up.

813
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:17,328
You little bitch.

814
00:46:18,362 --> 00:46:21,263
Take it out!

815
00:46:21,265 --> 00:46:23,799
[sobbing]

816
00:46:23,801 --> 00:46:27,436
[cries]

817
00:46:27,438 --> 00:46:29,240
Jessica, please.

818
00:46:32,710 --> 00:46:35,110
It's cold.

819
00:46:35,112 --> 00:46:36,547
I'm freezing.

820
00:46:38,015 --> 00:46:40,315
There's a storm coming in.

821
00:46:40,317 --> 00:46:43,485
I saw it on the news.
It's gonna be freezing.

822
00:46:43,487 --> 00:46:45,521
Please.

823
00:46:45,523 --> 00:46:48,457
I get cold... I get cold easy.

824
00:46:48,459 --> 00:46:50,192
I don't like the cold.

825
00:46:50,194 --> 00:46:53,028
Please.
- You left my front door open.

826
00:46:53,030 --> 00:46:54,632
I hope you freeze to death.

827
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,802
[Sammy] What? [laughs]

828
00:46:59,804 --> 00:47:01,403
What did you say?

829
00:47:01,405 --> 00:47:04,006
You hope I freeze to death?

830
00:47:04,008 --> 00:47:07,810
Oh, you hope I freeze to death.

831
00:47:07,812 --> 00:47:09,344
[mimics] I hope
you freeze to death.

832
00:47:09,346 --> 00:47:11,013
I hope you freeze to death.

833
00:47:11,015 --> 00:47:15,350
[laughter]

834
00:47:15,352 --> 00:47:21,356
Hope? You hope I freeze to
death? You're an idiot.

835
00:47:21,358 --> 00:47:25,561
People who use hope
are desperate, Jessica.

836
00:47:25,563 --> 00:47:28,997
They're desperate people,
weak people.

837
00:47:28,999 --> 00:47:31,166
Shut up.

838
00:47:31,168 --> 00:47:34,503
I heard you went through rehab,
Jessica.

839
00:47:34,505 --> 00:47:36,772
Oh yeah, Rob told me,
he told me all about it.

840
00:47:36,774 --> 00:47:39,608
Oh yeah, Jessica,
she went through rehab.

841
00:47:39,610 --> 00:47:42,511
Did they teach you
hope in rehab?

842
00:47:42,513 --> 00:47:45,614
That's what they taught you?
They taught you to hope?

843
00:47:45,616 --> 00:47:48,584
Right after they took
all of your money.

844
00:47:48,586 --> 00:47:53,589
Oh yeah. I know that routine,
Jessica.

845
00:47:53,591 --> 00:47:57,459
I went through rehab.
Oh, yeah.

846
00:47:57,461 --> 00:48:02,131
I was clean and sober
for a long time, Jessica.

847
00:48:02,133 --> 00:48:05,234
I got a job.
I took college courses.

848
00:48:05,236 --> 00:48:09,304
I even filed a tax return.

849
00:48:09,306 --> 00:48:13,144
And then after my mother died.

850
00:48:14,812 --> 00:48:21,984
I realized that no one
in the whole world

851
00:48:21,986 --> 00:48:25,587
gave a shit about me anymore.

852
00:48:25,589 --> 00:48:28,390
That's what they didn't
teach me in rehab.

853
00:48:28,392 --> 00:48:31,760
They didn't tell me
when I got sober

854
00:48:31,762 --> 00:48:35,430
that I would go back
to the same miserable life

855
00:48:35,432 --> 00:48:37,635
I used drugs to get away from.

856
00:48:41,739 --> 00:48:43,140
Jessica?

857
00:48:48,345 --> 00:48:51,348
You still got the three grams
in there with you?

858
00:48:53,751 --> 00:48:54,985
Yes.

859
00:48:58,322 --> 00:49:00,422
You ain't
gonna last long, Jessica.

860
00:49:00,424 --> 00:49:02,424
Stop talking to me.

861
00:49:02,426 --> 00:49:05,127
- [Sammy] You know it. I know it.
- Stop talking to me.

862
00:49:05,129 --> 00:49:06,397
[Sammy laughs]

863
00:49:09,433 --> 00:49:11,533
You know something?

864
00:49:11,535 --> 00:49:16,939
I can smell weakness from here.
I can smell it.

865
00:49:16,941 --> 00:49:20,108
The stink of weakness.

866
00:49:20,110 --> 00:49:21,510
[Jessica cries]

867
00:49:21,512 --> 00:49:22,680
[Sammy] You and I.

868
00:49:24,782 --> 00:49:26,348
We understand.

869
00:49:26,350 --> 00:49:28,116
[Jessica]
I don't molest little girls.

870
00:49:28,118 --> 00:49:30,986
I hate you,
and I hate everyone like you.

871
00:49:30,988 --> 00:49:34,258
How many people do you know
like me, Jessica?

872
00:49:37,161 --> 00:49:38,963
Did somebody touch you,

873
00:49:40,998 --> 00:49:42,566
when you were a little girl?

874
00:49:44,134 --> 00:49:48,337
Put their hands on you, Jessica,
when you were a little girl.

875
00:49:48,339 --> 00:49:49,571
[continues indistinctly]
- [Jessica] Stop talking to me.

876
00:49:49,573 --> 00:49:51,974
Stop talking to me.
Stop talking to me.

877
00:49:51,976 --> 00:49:54,343
I said stop talking!

878
00:49:54,345 --> 00:49:57,145
[Sammy screams in pain]

879
00:49:57,147 --> 00:50:00,117
[Sammy groans]

880
00:50:03,654 --> 00:50:04,887
[Jessica sobbing]

881
00:50:04,889 --> 00:50:09,258
[thunder rumbles]

882
00:50:09,260 --> 00:50:10,726
[chipping]

883
00:50:10,728 --> 00:50:12,895
[Sammy] [cries] Please, Jessica.
Please.

884
00:50:12,897 --> 00:50:14,663
I'm freezing here.

885
00:50:14,665 --> 00:50:18,166
I'm cold. I'm cold.

886
00:50:18,168 --> 00:50:21,270
[Jessica shivering]

887
00:50:21,272 --> 00:50:22,404
[chipping]

888
00:50:22,406 --> 00:50:23,886
- [thunder rumbles]
- [light flickers]

889
00:50:26,877 --> 00:50:29,344
[chipping]

890
00:50:29,346 --> 00:50:30,712
[Sammy] What are you doing,
Jessica?

891
00:50:30,714 --> 00:50:32,750
I'm getting out.

892
00:50:34,685 --> 00:50:37,321
You're gonna scratch your way
out like a little mouse?

893
00:50:39,356 --> 00:50:44,526
You know, what? I wasn't gonna
hurt you or your kids.

894
00:50:44,528 --> 00:50:45,594
Yeah, right.

895
00:50:45,596 --> 00:50:48,063
[Sammy] I like kids.

896
00:50:48,065 --> 00:50:49,533
I'm not a bad guy.

897
00:50:50,601 --> 00:50:51,566
You're a monster.

898
00:50:51,568 --> 00:50:54,204
[thunder rumbles]

899
00:50:56,607 --> 00:50:57,906
Oh.

900
00:50:57,908 --> 00:50:59,109
Dammit.

901
00:51:00,444 --> 00:51:03,412
[Sammy] Power's out,
you dumb bitch.

902
00:51:03,414 --> 00:51:06,114
[small footsteps]

903
00:51:06,116 --> 00:51:07,249
- [Jessica] Lainey?
- [Lainey] Mommy?

904
00:51:07,251 --> 00:51:10,385

Watch out for false prophets.

966
00:56:24,635 --> 00:56:26,935
They come to you
in sheep's clothing,

967
00:56:26,937 --> 00:56:29,771
but inwardly
they are ferocious wolves.

968
00:56:29,773 --> 00:56:32,140
By their fruit,
you will recognize them.

969
00:56:32,142 --> 00:56:34,376
Do people pick grapes from
thorn bushes

970
00:56:34,378 --> 00:56:36,213
or figs from thistles?

971
00:56:38,982 --> 00:56:42,784
Likewise, every good tree
bears good fruit,

972
00:56:42,786 --> 00:56:45,287
but a bad tree bears bad fruit.

973
00:56:45,289 --> 00:56:48,290
A good tree cannot bear
bad fruit,

974
00:56:48,292 --> 00:56:50,825
and a bad tree
cannot bear good fruit.

975
00:56:50,827 --> 00:56:53,128
Every tree
that does not bear good fruit

976
00:56:53,130 --> 00:56:55,330
is cut down
and thrown into the fire.

977
00:56:55,332 --> 00:56:58,068
Thus by their fruit
you will recognize them.

01:09:52,842 --> 01:09:54,008
[Mason crying]

1089
01:09:54,010 --> 01:09:55,078
Lainey!

1090
01:09:56,245 --> 01:09:58,446
[Sammy] Sit down. Sit down.

1091
01:09:58,448 --> 01:09:59,513
Sit down!

1092
01:09:59,515 --> 01:10:00,848
No, no, no, no!

1093
01:10:00,850 --> 01:10:01,849
Let them go.

1094
01:10:01,851 --> 01:10:03,117
[Sammy] Stop crying.

1095
01:10:03,119 --> 01:10:04,518
Stop crying.

1096
01:10:04,520 --> 01:10:05,519
Mommy's here!

1097
01:10:05,521 --> 01:10:07,121
Let them go, please.

1098
01:10:07,123 --> 01:10:09,356
[mimics]
Please, please, please, please.

1099
01:10:09,358 --> 01:10:10,691
Please let them go!

1100
01:10:10,693 --> 01:10:14,228
I said please twelve times,
Jessica!

1101
01:10:14,230 --> 01:10:16,197
Remember? Please, please!

1102
01:10:16,199 --> 01:10:18,232
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1103
01:10:18,234 --> 01:10:20,701
[Sammy] Please, please.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1104
01:10:20,703 --> 01:10:22,736
- [Jessica] Let them go!
- You want... you want Mommy?

1105
01:10:22,738 --> 01:10:23,938
You want Mommy?

1106
01:10:23,940 --> 01:10:25,706
Mommy, I wanna go.

1107
01:10:25,708 --> 01:10:27,541
- Ssshh. Just sit tight.
- Look what you did to my hand!

1108
01:10:27,543 --> 01:10:28,709
[Mason crying]

1109
01:10:28,711 --> 01:10:29,977
[Sammy] Stop!

1110
01:10:29,979 --> 01:10:33,414
Stand there! Don't move!
Don't move!

1111
01:10:33,416 --> 01:10:34,715
The meth is still in
the pantry downstairs.

1112
01:10:34,717 --> 01:10:35,749
You can have it, okay?

1113
01:10:35,751 --> 01:10:36,984
You can have it.
Just go take it.

1114
01:10:36,986 --> 01:10:38,486
Yeah?

1115
01:10:38,488 --> 01:10:39,487
There's money in there too.

1116
01:10:39,489 --> 01:10:41,388
There's money,
there's like thousands,

1117
01:10:41,390 --> 01:10:43,090
there's a lot of money
from my grandmother.

1118
01:10:43,092 --> 01:10:44,325
You can have it, okay?
- Yeah? There's money in there?

1119
01:10:44,327 --> 01:10:45,759
Just. just give me the baby.

1120
01:10:45,761 --> 01:10:47,161
I'm gonna cut your babies.

1121
01:10:47,163 --> 01:10:48,896
Stop! Stop!

1122
01:10:48,898 --> 01:10:50,998
Let them go.
- Don't cry. Don't cry.

1123
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,667
Don't cry. Don't cry. Don't cry.

1124
01:10:53,669 --> 01:10:55,069
Please just... please stop!

1125
01:10:55,071 --> 01:10:56,437
Please let them go.

1126
01:10:56,439 --> 01:10:57,938
[Sammy] Don't move.

1127
01:10:57,940 --> 01:10:59,240
- [Jessica] Let them go!
- Move again, and I'll cut him.

1128
01:10:59,242 --> 01:11:00,841
I'll cut him. I...
- Drop the knife, Sammy.

1129
01:11:00,843 --> 01:11:02,576
- [Mason crying]
- [Rob] Drop the knife!

1130
01:11:02,578 --> 01:11:03,811
What the hell are you
doing here with my kids?

1131
01:11:03,813 --> 01:11:05,479
[Sammy] That bitch.

1132
01:11:05,481 --> 01:11:06,580
Put a screwdriver
through my hand.

1133
01:11:06,582 --> 01:11:07,948
- I don't want to hear it now.
- Look at it.

1134
01:11:07,950 --> 01:11:09,450
Look what she did to me!
- [Rob] Drop the knife!

1135
01:11:09,452 --> 01:11:10,417
[Sammy] She put a screwdriver
through my hand.

1136
01:11:10,419 --> 01:11:11,585
Drop the knife, man.

1137
01:11:11,587 --> 01:11:13,454
Drop it.
- [Sammy] You owe me money, Rob.

1138
01:11:13,456 --> 01:11:14,655
You owe me money.

1139
01:11:14,657 --> 01:11:15,756
- [gunshot]
- [Jessica screams]

1140
01:11:15,758 --> 01:11:17,825
[Rob]
Drop the knife! On the floor!

1141
01:11:17,827 --> 01:11:19,126
Drop the knife.
- [Sammy] All right.

1142
01:11:19,128 --> 01:11:20,494
It's down. It's down.
- [Rob] Drop the knife!

1143
01:11:20,496 --> 01:11:21,428
It's down. It's down.
It's down.

1144
01:11:21,430 --> 01:11:23,964
[Mason crying loudly]

1145
01:11:23,966 --> 01:11:25,332
[Rob] Let go of my kid.
That's good. That's good.

1146
01:11:25,334 --> 01:11:26,333
Don't worry, baby.

1147
01:11:26,335 --> 01:11:27,768
Just go with mom.
Go with mom.

1148
01:11:27,770 --> 01:11:29,637
[Mason crying loudly]

1149
01:11:29,639 --> 01:11:32,139
You didn't answer my question.

1150
01:11:32,141 --> 01:11:33,440
Look what she did to my hand.

1151
01:11:33,442 --> 01:11:34,675
[Rob] What are you doing here
with my kids?

1152
01:11:34,677 --> 01:11:35,809
What are you,
some kind of pedophile?

1153
01:11:35,811 --> 01:11:37,111
[Sammy] You owe me money!

1154
01:11:37,113 --> 01:11:38,612
[gunshot]

1155
01:11:38,614 --> 01:11:40,347
What is that?

1156
01:11:40,349 --> 01:11:41,584
A tree branch fell, baby.

1157
01:11:43,119 --> 01:11:44,639
[Rob] Jessica,
where ya running off to?

1158
01:11:46,189 --> 01:11:48,522
Thank you for coming back.

1159
01:11:48,524 --> 01:11:49,857
I just want to
get the kids out of here.

1160
01:11:49,859 --> 01:11:52,526
Hey, here.
Um, I just need my car keys.

1161
01:11:52,528 --> 01:11:54,562
The kids are safe.

1162
01:11:54,564 --> 01:11:55,629
Sammy won't hurt them now.

1163
01:11:55,631 --> 01:11:57,498
I... I took care of it.

1164
01:11:57,500 --> 01:11:58,500
- Come on.
- [Rob] So.

1165
01:12:00,403 --> 01:12:01,803
What's this
about your Nana's money?

1166
01:12:06,175 --> 01:12:09,910
- [wood falls down]
- Who oh!

1167
01:12:09,912 --> 01:12:13,013
I think that was easier
to put up than take down.

1168
01:12:13,015 --> 01:12:14,215
[chuckles]

1169
01:12:14,217 --> 01:12:15,952
I need to
get the kids to the doctor.

1170
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:19,420
Why?
They look fine to me.

1171
01:12:19,422 --> 01:12:20,554
All right?

1172
01:12:20,556 --> 01:12:22,389
Don't be
such a helicopter parent.

1173
01:12:22,391 --> 01:12:24,225
They're hungry.
We need to eat.

1174
01:12:24,227 --> 01:12:27,361
It's freezing
and my hand is infected

1175
01:12:27,363 --> 01:12:28,397
Yeah, all right.

1176
01:12:30,266 --> 01:12:32,068
[door opens]

1177
01:12:42,712 --> 01:12:44,511
[Jessica sighs deeply]

1178
01:12:44,513 --> 01:12:47,348
Looks like you had
a little fun in here.

1179
01:12:47,350 --> 01:12:48,349
[Jessica] I didn't.

1180
01:12:48,351 --> 01:12:49,351
I'm still clean.

1181
01:12:54,590 --> 01:12:57,193
Holy shit.
You weren't lying.

1182
01:13:01,731 --> 01:13:03,799
Holy shit balls!

1183
01:13:06,202 --> 01:13:07,202
[rustling]

1184
01:13:10,439 --> 01:13:12,640
Do you know what this'll buy us?

1185
01:13:12,642 --> 01:13:13,974
[Jessica] You can take it, okay?

1186
01:13:13,976 --> 01:13:16,977
Just have all of it.
Just go and leave us alone.

1187
01:13:16,979 --> 01:13:20,016
[Mason coos]

1188
01:13:23,219 --> 01:13:24,219
You never shot it?

1189
01:13:29,325 --> 01:13:30,326
Wanna try?

1190
01:13:36,432 --> 01:13:37,632
Come on. We'll do it together.

1191
01:13:40,736 --> 01:13:41,804
Okay.

1192
01:13:45,241 --> 01:13:46,340
Okay?

1193
01:13:46,342 --> 01:13:47,542
Yeah, I'm ready. Let's do it.

1194
01:13:52,281 --> 01:13:53,781
There's food out in the car.

1195
01:13:53,783 --> 01:13:55,384
I want to feed the kids first.

1196
01:13:56,686 --> 01:13:58,020
We should eat something too.

1197
01:13:59,789 --> 01:14:02,091
It's important to eat, or you'll
get sick. You know that.

1198
01:14:08,030 --> 01:14:10,130
Yeah, yeah.
All... all right.

1199
01:14:10,132 --> 01:14:11,131
Yeah, let's eat first.

1200
01:14:11,133 --> 01:14:12,133
[sniffles]

1201
01:14:14,036 --> 01:14:15,316
I'll get the food.
You stay here.

1202
01:14:21,444 --> 01:14:24,613
[♪]

1203
01:14:31,987 --> 01:14:33,821
Can I have some?

1204
01:14:33,823 --> 01:14:37,791
No, baby, this is for Daddy.

1205
01:14:37,793 --> 01:14:39,428
He's bringing our food
in from the car.

1206
01:14:41,297 --> 01:14:42,297
Daddy's bad.

1207
01:14:43,666 --> 01:14:44,798
[Jessica] Yeah.

1208
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:45,801
He is.

1209
01:14:50,673 --> 01:14:53,442
[clanking and thudding]

1210
01:14:55,311 --> 01:14:56,844
[Rob] Jess, you ready?

1211
01:14:56,846 --> 01:14:58,547
I got some better stuff here.

1212
01:14:59,715 --> 01:15:01,717
I just picked it up
on my way over.

1213
01:15:03,386 --> 01:15:04,906
[Jessica]
Better than what you gave me?

1214
01:15:06,188 --> 01:15:07,821
You said it was pharma grade.

1215
01:15:07,823 --> 01:15:09,323
[Rob chuckles]

1216
01:15:09,325 --> 01:15:10,691
Yeah. I was wrong.

1217
01:15:10,693 --> 01:15:11,759
That shit's cut heavy.

1218
01:15:11,761 --> 01:15:14,027
I took one hit
and lost it pretty bad.

1219
01:15:14,029 --> 01:15:16,163
That's what I got here so late.

1220
01:15:16,165 --> 01:15:17,931
Wasn't my fault.

1221
01:15:17,933 --> 01:15:20,601
I'm glad you didn't take it.

1222
01:15:20,603 --> 01:15:22,405
I'm stickin' to
crystals from now on.

1223
01:15:25,241 --> 01:15:26,681
I'm not hungry.
Don't worry about it.

1224
01:15:28,944 --> 01:15:30,780
[Mason coos]

1225
01:15:32,748 --> 01:15:35,215
[Jessica]
You need to eat first.

1226
01:15:35,217 --> 01:15:38,154
You saw the way Sammy was.
Just wasted away.

1227
01:15:41,223 --> 01:15:43,757
You have to make yourself eat,

1228
01:15:43,759 --> 01:15:45,428
even when
you don't feel like it.

1229
01:15:50,032 --> 01:15:51,033
Yeah.

1230
01:15:52,034 --> 01:15:53,066
[Mason coos]

1231
01:15:53,068 --> 01:15:55,068
[Rob] Yeah, you're right.

1232
01:15:55,070 --> 01:15:57,039
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

1233
01:16:15,491 --> 01:16:16,490
Mm.

1234
01:16:16,492 --> 01:16:17,526
That's good.

1235
01:16:19,728 --> 01:16:21,061
What is this crap?

1236
01:16:21,063 --> 01:16:22,396
Looks like
literal crap, you know?

1237
01:16:22,398 --> 01:16:24,465
[Jessica soft chuckles]

1238
01:16:24,467 --> 01:16:26,569
It's my nana's apple butter.

1239
01:16:29,839 --> 01:16:30,906
Mm.

1240
01:16:32,508 --> 01:16:34,074
[chuckles]

1241
01:16:34,076 --> 01:16:36,645
[Mason cooing]

1242
01:16:42,751 --> 01:16:43,751
Eat up.

1243
01:16:46,822 --> 01:16:49,456
[water flowing]

1244
01:16:49,458 --> 01:16:51,792
[liquid sizzling]

1245
01:16:51,794 --> 01:16:53,594
[water flowing]

1246
01:16:53,596 --> 01:16:55,396
- [Jessica grunts in pain]
- [plates clanking]

1247
01:16:58,701 --> 01:17:00,100
[liquid sizzling continues]

1248
01:17:00,102 --> 01:17:02,271
[Jessica] Can we do that
in the living room, please?

1249
01:17:03,706 --> 01:17:04,874
I don't want the kids to see.

1250
01:17:08,110 --> 01:17:09,178
[Rob] Yeah, sure.

1251
01:17:14,149 --> 01:17:15,584
[grunts]

1252
01:17:17,653 --> 01:17:18,653
[sighs]

1253
01:17:26,896 --> 01:17:27,896
Your turn.

1254
01:17:30,900 --> 01:17:31,901
Here.

1255
01:17:41,877 --> 01:17:42,877
I'm not ready yet.

1256
01:17:45,047 --> 01:17:46,048
I'll do it later.

1257
01:17:47,816 --> 01:17:50,817
No way. [chuckles]

1258
01:17:50,819 --> 01:17:53,820
Come on.
We're doing this together.

1259
01:17:53,822 --> 01:17:54,990
Hurry up.

1260
01:17:56,325 --> 01:17:57,793
I got one more
hit in this needle.

1261
01:18:00,029 --> 01:18:01,263
Well, I want a clean needle.

1262
01:18:05,200 --> 01:18:06,333
