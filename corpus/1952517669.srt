00:13:16,036 --> 00:13:18,717
- If I had been an actor, what is it
that you would have asked me?

169
00:13:18,837 --> 00:13:20,104
Ohhh.

170
00:13:20,522 --> 00:13:22,080
You wouldn't get it.

171
00:13:23,002 --> 00:13:24,071
Probably not.

172
00:13:24,442 --> 00:13:28,515
Well, shit what the fuck is it that you do?
I mean, if you're not an actor...

173
00:13:29,682 --> 00:13:35,598
I'm part of an elite organization
of telephonic representatives... Yeah.

174
00:13:36,202 --> 00:13:40,639
- I answer phones, like, for a living.
- Wow!

175
00:13:40,922 --> 00:13:42,753
Well, that's great.
I mean really.

176
00:13:43,042 --> 00:13:45,636
That's— That's interesting.

177
00:13:46,882 --> 00:13:51,831
Well, good luck with that. Trust me,
hard work always pays off in the end.

178
00:14:02,282 --> 00:14:05,399
You look like you're having
as bad a time as I am.

179
00:14:06,722 --> 00:14:07,711
That depends.

180
00:14:08,242 --> 00:14:10,836
- Did you see that woman I was just talking to?
- Yeah.

181
00:14:11,002 --> 00:14:14,119
- Have you had to talk to her yet?
- No.

182
00:14:14,722 --> 00:14:19,113
Okay, then I win.
My time, so far, has been worse than yours.

183
00:14:20,482 --> 00:14:26,671
It's like... the whole time she was talking to me...
I just kept trying to wish myself back to a happier place.

184
00:14:27,042 --> 00:14:29,431
Like... getting a colonoscopy
or something.

185
00:14:29,602 --> 00:14:34,073
It normally takes me a hell of a lot longer
to work my colon into the conversation, but...

186
00:14:34,242 --> 00:14:36,836
you just, like, right away,
got down to business.

187
00:14:37,285 --> 00:14:39,354
- Mmm, pun intended?
- Always.

188
00:14:42,162 --> 00:14:45,074
- I'm Trevor, by the way.
- Ephram.

189
00:14:45,242 --> 00:14:48,791
- But actually, we kind of met before.
- Kind of?

190
00:14:48,962 --> 00:14:53,194
Yeah, County. I was working the day
you brought your friend in, about a month ago.

191
00:14:53,802 --> 00:14:55,235
Oh.. shit.

192
00:14:56,802 --> 00:15:00,477
- I wouldn't expect you to remember me.
- No... Yeah.

193
00:15:00,722 --> 00:15:02,758
Actually I do.

194
00:15:02,922 --> 00:15:07,438
- I think I might have been a little short with you that day.
- Well, you <i>were</i> sitting down.

195
00:15:07,802 --> 00:15:10,362
A doctor with a sense of humor!

196
00:15:10,522 --> 00:15:15,642
Yeah. Well, I'm still interning, so it'll be awhile
before anyone takes me too seriously.

197
00:15:17,722 --> 00:15:19,758
Well, sorry...

198
00:15:20,962 --> 00:15:22,839
for being an asshole.

199
00:15:29,082 --> 00:15:33,075
- Do you want to get out of here?
- Like... right now?

200
00:15:36,842 --> 00:15:37,957
Pick a light.

201
00:15:38,482 --> 00:15:39,437
Do what now?

202
00:15:39,602 --> 00:15:44,722
I do this thing with building lights,
stars, what happens to be in view.

203
00:15:46,082 --> 00:15:49,597
See, you look out there
and there's all these amazing lights.

204
00:15:49,762 --> 00:15:52,879
Just a huge smattering of lights.

205
00:15:53,042 --> 00:15:56,193
It's what you do...
So choose one...

206
00:15:57,202 --> 00:16:01,673
and describe what's happening there.
Go ahead. Try it.

207
00:16:02,122 --> 00:16:03,396
Okay.

208
00:16:04,042 --> 00:16:09,116
- So that light, right there...
- Oh, no-no-no, don't show me...

209
00:16:10,042 --> 00:16:11,395
Just tell me.

210
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:15,914
Is there a manual? I mean I think this would be
a lot easier if there were, like, a guide or something.

211
00:16:16,082 --> 00:16:18,596
I'm your guide.
Do it.

212
00:16:19,162 --> 00:16:21,392
I'm looking at this light...

213
00:16:22,042 --> 00:16:24,158
and I see...

214
00:16:27,242 --> 00:16:30,393
a young boy, sitting in his room...

215
00:16:31,402 --> 00:16:33,916
He's maybe 12.

216
00:16:34,602 --> 00:16:37,639
He just got into this
huge fight with his dad, and...

217
00:16:37,802 --> 00:16:42,557
One of those fights that end up
being bigger than the people having it, and...

218
00:16:42,722 --> 00:16:46,681
This time, he's not so sure that
he'll be able to get past it...

219
00:16:46,842 --> 00:16:50,232
so he just hugs his knees
closer to his chest...

220
00:16:50,882 --> 00:16:53,840
and dreams of some day getting away.

221
00:16:59,162 --> 00:17:02,632
You can really see that?
Good eyes!

222
00:17:02,802 --> 00:17:06,112
Shut up. I'm playing your game.
Don't make fun of me.

223
00:17:06,282 --> 00:17:10,116
I wasn't. You do have great eyes.
Scout's honor.

224
00:17:12,242 --> 00:17:14,597
Yeah, I was never a Scout.

225
00:17:15,762 --> 00:17:19,277
I don't know if I should...
be asking this, but...

226
00:17:19,602 --> 00:17:22,400
I've just really been wondering
how your friend is doing.

227
00:17:24,202 --> 00:17:25,430
He's fine.

228
00:17:25,922 --> 00:17:28,390
- Is he still...
- No, I don't...

229
00:17:28,602 --> 00:17:31,639
at least I don't think he—
I mean, he's on Methadone, so...

230
00:17:33,322 --> 00:17:35,790
So you guys still do
see each other then?

231
00:17:36,562 --> 00:17:38,712
Yeah, we're still friends.

232
00:17:40,482 --> 00:17:42,598
Are you still more than friends?

233
00:17:42,922 --> 00:17:46,278
- Consider me single.
- Good.

234
00:17:46,522 --> 00:17:48,399
... for you.

235
00:17:52,042 --> 00:17:53,680
... and for me.

236
00:17:56,042 --> 00:17:59,432
I don't... really know
how to respond to that.

You have to go now. Come on...

Don't worry.

I'm so sorry. I'm sorry for

You shouldn't be.

I might not have floated back to your place
like an alcoholic blimp.

263
00:21:00,442 --> 00:21:02,831
Where did you go,
anyway?

You don't live here, you know.

268
00:21:19,842 --> 00:21:21,161
Found it!

269
00:21:30,802 --> 00:21:31,996
You seem weird.

270
00:21:33,082 --> 00:21:36,074
What are you doing?
Are you, like, smiling for some reason?

271
00:21:37,242 --> 00:21:41,315
- For real, are you fantasizing about unicorns again?
- Yes, Jake.

272
00:21:41,482 --> 00:21:45,191
Well, I didn't mean to interrupt.
Please continue with your faggotry.

273
00:21:45,362 --> 00:21:47,478
Thanks.

274
00:21:48,402 --> 00:21:50,120
There you go again.

275
00:21:52,082 --> 00:21:57,679
Okay, so... maybe I am just a little more...
whatever, than yesterday.

276
00:21:57,842 --> 00:22:01,278
Yeah, you are...
weirder than yesterday.

277
00:22:02,522 --> 00:22:05,082
Don't talk, just play.

278
00:22:14,602 --> 00:22:18,481
- And so I was thinking of becoming a vegetarian.
- What?

279
00:22:18,642 --> 00:22:22,191
- No meat.
- I know what it means, Jake. Look...

280
00:22:22,311 --> 00:22:24,491
I sorry to say this,
but your meat-eating habits...

281
00:22:24,611 --> 00:22:27,117
are the only thing currently
distinguishing you from lesbian.

282
00:22:28,322 --> 00:22:31,678
Honestly, if you do that, you'll become
a full-fledged carpet-muncher.

283
00:22:31,842 --> 00:22:34,561
- That's so gross!
- It's true!

284
00:22:34,762 --> 00:22:38,437
Nothing against lesbians, you know.
I mean, I have an aunt who's lesbian.

285
00:22:38,602 --> 00:22:41,912
God, I love it. It's like when
that soccer mom in the South is all...

286
00:22:42,082 --> 00:22:45,552
"Seriously, though, I have
a black friend at work."

287
00:22:45,842 --> 00:22:49,066
- You know I was just joking
about lesbians, though, right?

288
00:22:49,186 --> 00:22:50,022
- Totally.

289
00:22:51,602 --> 00:22:53,081
I love them.

♫ You're just across the table,
but we're worlds apart. ♫

291
00:23:00,002 --> 00:23:04,119
So back to me becoming a vegetarian,
you know, animal protein isn't all that good for you.

292
00:23:04,239 --> 00:23:07,016
- I've been talking to Deanna about it
'cause she's, like, a vegan...

293
00:23:07,136 --> 00:23:08,242
- Yeah, well...

294
00:23:08,362 --> 00:23:11,354
- She's also a Wicca?
- Oh, yeah.

295
00:23:11,842 --> 00:23:13,036
Fuck!

296
00:23:17,842 --> 00:23:21,357
- I'm sure I told him 7:00.
- God, he'll be here.

297
00:23:21,522 --> 00:23:25,037
What happened to my drink?
How did you get yours already?

298
00:23:25,682 --> 00:23:27,673
- Did you get sex?
- What?

299
00:23:27,842 --> 00:23:33,519
- Sex on the Beach. I know how much you love
those cunty drinks so I just, like, assumed. - Right.

300
00:23:33,682 --> 00:23:37,516
- What did you think I was talking about?
- I'm so sorry I'm late.

301
00:23:37,682 --> 00:23:41,880
- You should be sorry about how much you're sweating.
- Is everything okay? - Yeah... no.

302
00:23:42,284 --> 00:23:45,247
Everything's fine.
Just... a little mix-up.

303
00:23:45,556 --> 00:23:47,794
Darrell borrowed my car
and he's supposed to pick me up,

304
00:23:47,914 --> 00:23:49,670
but he got tied up with something, so...

305
00:23:50,122 --> 00:23:52,761
- Why didn't you just call one of us?
- Yeah...

306
00:23:52,922 --> 00:23:55,994
... no. See... Okay...

307
00:23:57,002 --> 00:23:59,391
He... Okay... Uh...

308
00:24:00,002 --> 00:24:06,840
He forgot to call me ahead of time...
and by the time that I got done with work...

309
00:24:07,002 --> 00:24:09,232
he had no reception
where he was, so...

310
00:24:09,882 --> 00:24:14,273
I kind of waited for, like,
a while, for your phones.

311
00:24:15,842 --> 00:24:17,833
So, how did you get here?

312
00:24:20,322 --> 00:24:24,281
- I just walked.
- You walked? All the way from work?

313
00:24:24,842 --> 00:24:25,911
Yes, I walked.

314
00:24:27,682 --> 00:24:29,354
One foot in front of the other.

315
00:24:31,322 --> 00:24:35,281
It's not that big of a deal.
Can we just, like, move on?

316
00:24:35,442 --> 00:24:36,397
Okay.

317
00:24:36,802 --> 00:24:39,157
Moving on...

318
00:24:40,242 --> 00:24:42,881
So, I met someone last night.

319
00:24:43,362 --> 00:24:48,117
See, I knew it. Now, when you say, "someone,"
like, what exactly to you mean?

320
00:24:48,282 --> 00:24:52,195
- Oh my God, can I take that back? -No.
- I didn't mean to tell you guys that.

321
00:24:52,362 --> 00:24:55,752
Sorry, there's no take-backs at this table.
So, talk about it.

322
00:24:56,042 --> 00:25:00,274
So... the other night when you
left me at the party with Mary C...

323
00:25:03,882 --> 00:25:07,397
So do you take all your...
"dates" to a parking lot?

324
00:25:08,722 --> 00:25:10,713
So this is a date, huh?

325
00:25:11,802 --> 00:25:17,001
No, I didn't mean "date" like that.
I didn't mean to say "date." I...

326
00:25:17,162 --> 00:25:20,279
I know it's not a date.
I mean...

327
00:25:20,562 --> 00:25:24,077
Technically, we just met,
so it wouldn't... even...

328
00:25:25,762 --> 00:25:27,798
I should just stop talking, huh?
- Yeah.

329
00:25:28,562 --> 00:25:32,077
- Under the stars? - Oh my God!
- So what does this mean?

330
00:25:32,242 --> 00:25:35,212
- What do you think? Trevor's in "lurve"... again.
- Very funny.

331
00:25:35,332 --> 00:25:38,958
Oh come on. You guys kissed. I mean in Trevor terms,
you're, like, practically married already.

332
00:25:39,122 --> 00:25:42,063
It doesn't mean anything necessarily,
okay. It was just... really nice.

333
00:25:42,183 --> 00:25:44,273
Well, does it mean you're
finally over Darrell,

334
00:25:44,393 --> 00:25:47,842
because to be honest, I was kind of getting sick
of the whole pseudo-friendship thing.

335
00:25:47,962 --> 00:25:52,478
- It was just wrong.
- Andie, you are way out of line.

336
00:25:53,362 --> 00:25:55,671
I'm sorry. What were
we talking about?

337
00:25:56,322 --> 00:25:58,916
Andie, I'm not having this discussion again.

338
00:25:59,682 --> 00:26:04,278
Darrell's clean, okay. That's all you need to know.
It's really none of your business, anyway.

339
00:26:04,398 --> 00:26:05,719
- Oh, it's not?
- No.

340
00:26:05,839 --> 00:26:08,515
- You've been making it my business
for quite some time now.

341
00:26:08,682 --> 00:26:09,637
- Have I?
- Mmhm.

342
00:26:09,802 --> 00:26:13,477
Okay, well, obviously he's not anymore,
so can both of you please just drop it?

343
00:26:13,642 --> 00:26:15,938
Hi. I'm sorry. My friends are fighting,

344
00:26:16,058 --> 00:26:19,386
so could you bring us some more drinks,
'cause their friendship, like, totally depends on it.

345
00:26:25,402 --> 00:26:29,236
You happy now?
There's more liquor coming, bitch.

346
00:26:31,162 --> 00:26:34,154
- So, it'll be a summer wedding...
- Jake, shut up already.

347
00:26:34,442 --> 00:26:38,151
Hey, so who's your maid of honor going to be?
Me or Jake?

348
00:26:38,271 --> 00:26:40,386
- Great! So you're playing along now too?
- Mm-hmm.

349
00:26:40,506 --> 00:26:44,242
- Oh come on, Andie. Don't you think
flower girl's a little more your speed?

350
00:26:44,362 --> 00:26:50,153
Yeah... Even though this conversation is thrilling and all,
I really didn't get much sleep last night, so...

351
00:26:50,322 --> 00:26:52,392
Can we actually, like, go?

352
00:26:57,082 --> 00:26:59,152
- Hey, you.
- Oh, hey.

353
00:26:59,682 --> 00:27:04,922
- Guys, this is, ummm...
- Richard. - ... Richard, right.

354
00:27:05,042 --> 00:27:09,240
- I mean, these are my friends, uh, Trevor and Andie.
- Hi, nice to meet you. - Hi!

355
00:27:10,042 --> 00:27:14,035
So, wow, you're... you're here.
What are you doing here?

356
00:27:14,202 --> 00:27:16,913
Oh, shut up.
Don't be so silly.

357
00:27:17,033 --> 00:27:19,129
Well, too bad I didn't know
you guys were out here.

358
00:27:19,249 --> 00:27:22,082
I've been bartending all night. I could have
hooked you guys up with something.

359
00:27:22,202 --> 00:27:24,282
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

360
00:27:24,402 --> 00:27:29,271
Well, I'm sorry, I'd stay, but I promised some friends
I'd stop by as soon as I got cut, so...

361
00:27:29,442 --> 00:27:31,433
Not a big deal.
We were totally just leaving.

362
00:27:31,602 --> 00:27:35,641
Alright, well, you need to call me, 'cause
I want to go out this weekend.

363
00:27:35,962 --> 00:27:40,717
Alright, well, it was nice to meet you guys—
and you... call me!

364
00:27:46,402 --> 00:27:50,361
- You know, I hate him.
- You're the one who fucked him.

365
00:27:50,522 --> 00:27:53,195
You're right.
I don't hate him.

366
00:27:53,842 --> 00:27:55,434
I hate her.

367
00:27:57,122 --> 00:27:58,396
You're in trouble.

368
00:28:00,962 --> 00:28:02,395
Give me the keys.

369
00:28:04,082 --> 00:28:07,279
- Sorry about earlier.
- Me too.

370
00:28:08,682 --> 00:28:10,798
- Oh my God.
- What?

371
00:28:10,962 --> 00:28:12,873
I know that guy.

372
00:28:13,442 --> 00:28:16,957
He used to be Darrell's dealer...
- So...

373
00:28:17,122 --> 00:28:19,078
... and that's my car.

374
00:28:19,362 --> 00:28:21,592
You've got to be
fucking kidding me.

375
00:28:22,562 --> 00:28:23,881
Trevor!

376
00:28:42,882 --> 00:28:44,520
Watching and waiting...

377
00:28:44,682 --> 00:28:50,439
telling time, telling lies, half-truths,
whole truths, and nothing but the truths.

378
00:28:51,002 --> 00:28:55,120
There is no truth,
at least none that I can discern.

379
00:28:58,242 --> 00:29:01,075
Veterinarian's office...
I like that.

380
00:29:01,802 --> 00:29:04,040
See, I've gotten
a lot better at this game.

381
00:29:04,522 --> 00:29:06,592
So, let's play
my game now.

382
00:29:06,712 --> 00:29:10,880
- You have a game?
- Yeah, so it's not so much a game, really.

383
00:29:11,042 --> 00:29:14,637
It's just more like you divulging
personal information, and... go.

384
00:29:14,802 --> 00:29:17,032
Wait, wait wait!
Hold up. Like what?

385
00:29:17,282 --> 00:29:19,876
Like, past relationships?

386
00:29:21,202 --> 00:29:24,877
This <i>is</i> a game!
Okay, what do you want to know?

387
00:29:25,042 --> 00:29:26,839
Just give me the big stuff.

388
00:29:27,002 --> 00:29:30,915
Any particular ex-boyfriends
that I should know about?

389
00:29:34,802 --> 00:29:35,837
Not really.

390
00:29:37,002 --> 00:29:39,641
Come on, just...
think of something.

391
00:29:39,962 --> 00:29:41,873
I don't know...

392
00:29:42,922 --> 00:29:46,437
I guess most of my relationships
have been pretty insignificant.

393
00:29:48,122 --> 00:29:51,831
Seems like a lot of the guys out here
aren't looking for the same thing I am.

394
00:29:52,002 --> 00:29:54,357
And what's that?

395
00:29:54,602 --> 00:29:55,830
Everything.

396
00:29:57,842 --> 00:29:59,355
Destiny.

397
00:30:00,162 --> 00:30:02,960
- No-one's lived up to that yet?
- No.

398
00:30:03,162 --> 00:30:07,235
Not really. Ask me again
in a little while, though. [kisses]

399
00:30:08,842 --> 00:30:10,594
So cheesy!

400
00:30:10,714 --> 00:30:12,262
Aa-ah!

401
00:30:13,122 --> 00:30:16,910
- Think that's funny, huh? - Mm-hmm.
- You think that's funny? - Yup.

402
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:21,079
Huh, what about this?
Is this funny?

403
00:30:23,802 --> 00:30:25,599
No, not really.

404
00:30:29,002 --> 00:30:34,122
- You're really not ticklish?
- No... nor am I five years old.

405
00:31:02,922 --> 00:31:05,834
I should go get something to...

406
00:31:06,002 --> 00:31:08,197
Don't... just wait a minute.

407
00:31:08,362 --> 00:31:10,239
- You sure?
- Yeaaah.

408
00:31:15,042 --> 00:31:18,717
- God, that was amazing.
- Yeah, I could tell.

409
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:20,711
Why's that?

410
00:31:21,242 --> 00:31:25,076
Babe, for, like, at least a minute,
you sounded like a 12-year-old cheerleader.

411
00:31:27,962 --> 00:31:29,689
What can I say?

412
00:31:29,809 --> 00:31:31,373
[laughs]

413
00:31:31,762 --> 00:31:33,718
It was very athletic.

414
00:31:33,986 --> 00:31:35,319
[laughs louder]

415
00:31:44,082 --> 00:31:47,358
It's really nice that
you cooked lunch at my place today.

416
00:31:47,522 --> 00:31:51,834
- Where did that come from?
- I don't know.

417
00:31:53,722 --> 00:31:58,637
Just thinking...
It's kind of like we live together.

418
00:31:59,472 --> 00:32:02,179
- Mm?
- Yeah. [laughs]

419
00:32:04,162 --> 00:32:06,437
Did you ever play house
when you were a kid?

420
00:32:06,602 --> 00:32:10,959
- Oh my God, you <i>are</i> a 12-year-old girl!
- [laughing] Shut up! No.

421
00:32:13,962 --> 00:32:18,911
I just was thinking how nice it would be
kind of to... stop "playing" house.

422
00:32:19,082 --> 00:32:23,917
But, babe, I don't think any of the other little girls
would still want to be your friend if you gave that up.

423
00:32:24,082 --> 00:32:25,674
[playfully] Shut up!

424
00:32:25,794 --> 00:32:27,996
[Trevor starts to laugh]

425
00:32:28,282 --> 00:32:30,512
Wait!
What's going on? [gasp]

426
00:32:30,682 --> 00:32:33,640
Are you, perhaps,
truly ticklish?

427
00:32:34,282 --> 00:32:35,562
[giggling] I'm not!

428
00:32:35,682 --> 00:32:38,594
Stop!
Stop it, I'm not.

429
00:32:39,362 --> 00:32:41,034
Uncle!

430
00:32:43,922 --> 00:32:46,277
- What did you say to me?
- "Uncle!"

431
00:32:46,442 --> 00:32:49,798
... to get you to stop.
- But, why did you call me "uncle"?

432
00:32:51,802 --> 00:32:53,793
Are you being for real?

433
00:32:54,482 --> 00:32:56,837
- You don't know what "uncle" means?
- Mm-mm.

434
00:32:57,362 --> 00:32:59,830
- Well, you've never heard that?
- No.

435
00:33:00,962 --> 00:33:04,238
What are you, Canadian?
Dude, it's something that kids say.

436
00:33:04,402 --> 00:33:06,836
- "Dude"?
- Shut up.

437
00:33:07,002 --> 00:33:12,520
Like, I don't know, when they want someone
to stop torturing them. It's like, "surrender."

438
00:33:12,937 --> 00:33:15,563
I thought it was what you called
the brother of one of your parents.

439
00:33:15,683 --> 00:33:17,083
- [sarcastic] Ha-ha.

440
00:33:17,203 --> 00:33:19,037
- I can't believe
you've never heard that.

441
00:33:19,157 --> 00:33:22,397
I can't believe you'd make something like that up
and pass it off as truth.

442
00:33:22,562 --> 00:33:28,273
- Oh..my..G, you're so delusional. Get out of bed.
- It's... my... bed.

443
00:33:28,442 --> 00:33:30,956
I don't care.
You're banished from the bedroom.

444
00:33:31,122 --> 00:33:34,034
Go get something and clean up.

445
00:33:34,202 --> 00:33:38,798
I have spoken...
and earlier you said that I was the boss.

446
00:33:42,842 --> 00:33:46,391
- What an idiot I am.
- That's what I'm saying.

447
00:33:58,762 --> 00:34:00,354
My God, I'm so fat!

448
00:34:02,202 --> 00:34:06,036
- Yeah, I was going to say something earlier.
- For real?

449
00:34:06,402 --> 00:34:09,360
We don't think I'm going to get, like,
a tan or something, do we?

450
00:34:09,522 --> 00:34:12,912
Jake, I keep telling you,
the undead don't tan.

451
00:34:13,082 --> 00:34:17,200
Okay, good, because
I hate that, like, bronzy skin tone.

452
00:34:18,002 --> 00:34:20,277
- You know, like yours?
- Uh-huh.

453
00:34:29,322 --> 00:34:30,914
What are you doing?

454
00:34:31,642 --> 00:34:33,314
Can I have that back?

455
00:34:33,682 --> 00:34:37,675
- No, seriously, what is this?
- Umm.. it's a card.

456
00:34:38,082 --> 00:34:40,801
You just read it, so...
you must know what it is.

457
00:34:44,482 --> 00:34:48,600
Oh, I read it alright. Unfortunately, I can't
process all of the crap pouring out of it.

458
00:34:48,762 --> 00:34:50,878
- It this a poem?
- No.

459
00:34:55,082 --> 00:34:56,913
Okay, maybe.
So?

460
00:34:58,442 --> 00:35:01,369
- You write Ephram poetry?
- I didn't write Ephram poetry.

461
00:35:01,489 --> 00:35:05,350
I don't write him poetry, okay?
I wrote him a poem. One poem.

462
00:35:05,522 --> 00:35:10,676
- Wow, I'm just, like, so grossed out right now.
- Shut up. I just... I thought it would be sweet.

463
00:35:10,842 --> 00:35:12,753
You never?

464
00:35:12,922 --> 00:35:17,677
Whatever... I mean if you ever spent
more than a couple of hours with one of your guys...

465
00:35:18,042 --> 00:35:20,920
you might find that
some of them write poetry, too.

466
00:35:21,082 --> 00:35:24,757
- What would be the point in that?
- Who are you?

467
00:35:25,202 --> 00:35:29,798
- Someone who's obviously more realistic than you.
- Fuck off.

468
00:35:32,802 --> 00:35:34,281
Okay, so listen...

469
00:35:34,482 --> 00:35:37,201
I have got kind of a favor
to ask of you.

470
00:35:37,762 --> 00:35:39,241
Oh God!

471
00:35:39,882 --> 00:35:43,511
- I'm going to regret asking what it is, aren't I?
- I don't know.

472
00:35:44,482 --> 00:35:47,360
Whatever, just tell me,
what is it?

473
00:35:48,842 --> 00:35:53,564
- It's, like, so stupid, not a big deal whatsoever.
I just was thinking...

474
00:35:53,684 --> 00:35:55,794
Jake, come on.

475
00:35:56,362 --> 00:35:57,351
Okay.

476
00:35:59,402 --> 00:36:01,711
So I think I might be pregnant.

477
00:36:03,322 --> 00:36:06,280
Oh my God, I can't believe
this is coming out of my mouth.

478
00:36:06,442 --> 00:36:09,912
I want you to go with me
to get an HIV test.

479
00:36:11,402 --> 00:36:15,793
I haven't been tested in a minute,
so I'm just a little bit anxious about it...

480
00:36:16,442 --> 00:36:21,470
and... I don't know,
I just thought that... you know...

481
00:36:21,730 --> 00:36:24,321
Yeah... I know.

482
00:36:24,882 --> 00:36:29,000
- I should probably go get tested, too.
- Yeah, I mean, who knows what Darrell gave you.

483
00:36:29,162 --> 00:36:30,959
Oh my God, shut up!

484
00:36:31,682 --> 00:36:33,513
Whatever, let's go.

485
00:36:34,143 --> 00:36:34,925
- Now?

486
00:36:35,045 --> 00:36:38,474
- Yeah, they have that new quick response test
or whatever. Like, why wait?

487
00:36:40,162 --> 00:36:41,277
Okay.

488
00:36:44,962 --> 00:36:49,001
Hey, Andie! Want to go
get tested for the hiv?

489
00:37:18,002 --> 00:37:19,196
Ready?

490
00:37:30,937 --> 00:37:31,962
- He's ready!

491
00:37:32,082 --> 00:37:36,394
Yeah, and I'm in a new relationship
which is completely monogamous, so...

492
00:37:37,002 --> 00:37:42,520
Just still staying protected and...
not having sex with anyone else, I guess.

493
00:37:42,682 --> 00:37:47,039
Well, you seem to have your bases
pretty much covered. Alright? See you safe.

494
00:37:47,202 --> 00:37:49,322
- Oh, thank God.
- Good.

495
00:37:49,442 --> 00:37:53,401
So what are some of the ways you think
you could keep yourself at low risk for transmission?

496
00:37:53,962 --> 00:37:55,873
Abstain.

497
00:38:18,042 --> 00:38:22,832
No, um, I think I'll wait
for the blood work.

498
00:38:23,522 --> 00:38:26,480
- Hah, and it's, like, eating itself.
- Your stomach?

499
00:38:26,642 --> 00:38:29,408
No, my ass.
Yes, my stomach.

500
00:38:29,690 --> 00:38:31,331
- What was taking so long?

501
00:38:31,451 --> 00:38:35,593
- Oh, I don't know. There was this mix-up, and then
the lady was, like, talking way too much.

502
00:38:35,762 --> 00:38:39,118
... but can we go? I am starving.
- Hurray, thank-you.

503
00:38:39,482 --> 00:38:44,192
- So you're sure everything is... okay?
- Oh my God, please.

504
00:38:48,802 --> 00:38:53,318
Yeah, but I mean I just came
with my friend for, like, moral support.

505
00:38:54,162 --> 00:38:57,950
- I understand—
- I mean if anyone should have it, he should have it.

506
00:39:00,842 --> 00:39:04,881
- Well, when do I get the results back
for the second test, the blood test?

507
00:39:05,042 --> 00:39:07,397
- Takes 7 days.

508
00:39:13,242 --> 00:39:16,473
You have 12 messages.

I know you don't want to talk to me but I have amazing—

Hey, Baby, it's me again. I know it's be—
- Message 3:

512
00:39:29,642 --> 00:39:34,318
Why won't you fucking call me back?
Call me back! I have—

513
00:39:35,562 --> 00:39:39,350
Hmmm, didn't realize
we had any messages.

514
00:39:39,842 --> 00:39:42,993
That's because you never check the machine.

516
00:39:51,082 --> 00:39:56,440
- You look good by the way.
- Oh. Thanks. Just finished this one.

517
00:39:56,602 --> 00:39:57,830
Nice.

get to know you better.

Oh.. yeah...
Um...

00:40:32,682 --> 00:40:35,833
I'm going to have to
get drunk now.

526
00:40:43,322 --> 00:40:45,313

What the fuck
are you doing here?

530
00:41:33,442 --> 00:41:35,194
We need to talk.

531
00:41:37,522 --> 00:41:38,875
Fine.

532
00:41:45,162 --> 00:41:47,153
Jake, would you mind
closing the door?

533
00:41:49,765 --> 00:41:52,840
Yeah...
Other side.

00:41:59,722 --> 00:42:01,713
What do you want?

535
00:42:03,402 --> 00:42:05,597
We... we need to talk.

536
00:42:06,162 --> 00:42:08,915
Yeah, I get it.
Talk about what?

537
00:42:11,522 --> 00:42:13,911
You... Trevor...

538
00:42:15,642 --> 00:42:16,916
You don't understand.

539
00:42:17,082 --> 00:42:21,155
Maybe I don't, but I don't
care to anymore, either.

540
00:42:22,802 --> 00:42:24,918
You're so fucked up, D!

541
00:42:27,042 --> 00:42:29,954
- I know... I know that.
- You don't know.

542
00:42:30,074 --> 00:42:32,486
- Hey, if you knew, you'd change.

543
00:42:32,606 --> 00:42:36,436
- I wanted to, baby, but it's not enough.
I need help. You need to help me!

544
00:42:36,602 --> 00:42:39,275
I don't "need"
to do anything for you.

545
00:42:43,922 --> 00:42:46,994
Okay... but I'm asking you.

546
00:42:47,210 --> 00:42:48,801
I'm pleading with you. Just...

547
00:42:48,921 --> 00:42:51,118
Darrell, we've been through this
so many fucking times now.

548
00:42:51,362 --> 00:42:55,514
Well, maybe I wouldn't be so fucked up,
if someone was actually there for me!

549
00:42:55,682 --> 00:42:59,994
if you were actually there for me!
- Don't you dare try to blame me. Okay, this is not my...

550
00:43:00,162 --> 00:43:03,711
- I'm not blaming you!
- You... are not my fault.

551
00:43:03,882 --> 00:43:06,601
You're the one who can't handle
any of your own problems.

552
00:43:06,762 --> 00:43:12,200
Guess what, Darrell? Everyone's got problems.
Okay? You don't have a fucking monopoly on pain.

553
00:43:12,362 --> 00:43:14,717
I think you like
being an addict, D.

554
00:43:15,176 --> 00:43:17,530
Because you think it leaves you
blameless in some way...

555
00:43:17,650 --> 00:43:21,158
like, you can't be held responsible for your actions,
because you're no longer in control.

556
00:43:21,442 --> 00:43:23,558
Yeah, you're one to talk?

557
00:43:26,522 --> 00:43:28,035
You know what?

558
00:43:29,242 --> 00:43:32,359
I'm not going to be here
for you to fall back on anymore.

559
00:43:33,362 --> 00:43:36,434
So you've got to learn to stand
on your own two feet.

560
00:43:37,562 --> 00:43:40,599
Use those feet and
get the fuck out of my hou—

561
00:43:45,282 --> 00:43:47,955
You're high!?
You're fucking high!?

562
00:43:48,122 --> 00:43:51,000
You come over here to tell me
to help you to change and you're high?

563
00:43:51,842 --> 00:43:54,436
- Get up.
- Hey, baby, don't... don't!

564
00:43:54,602 --> 00:43:56,354
Get up!

565
00:43:57,402 --> 00:44:00,200
- No, Trev, don't.
- Get out!

566
00:44:00,362 --> 00:44:02,671
- FUCK YOU!
- Thank-you!

567
00:44:23,762 --> 00:44:25,514
Whoa, Buffy,
it's me.

00:44:28,402 --> 00:44:29,596
You okay?

569
00:44:30,642 --> 00:44:33,156
God, I could hear you guys
yelling from out there.

570
00:44:33,442 --> 00:44:37,355
I mean, I was standing
a little closer to the door, but still...

571
00:44:37,842 --> 00:44:39,673
- I can't believe him.

572
00:44:40,762 --> 00:44:42,718
Honestly, I'm fine now.

573
00:44:46,042 --> 00:44:49,478
You guys...
it's fine, seriously.

574
00:44:49,922 --> 00:44:52,117
Go back to partying.

575
00:45:19,082 --> 00:45:21,471
- Are we leaving?
- Yeah.

576
00:45:22,882 --> 00:45:24,873
Thanks for being here.

577
00:45:25,362 --> 00:45:28,479
I mean, you know,
it's always fun to see Darrell.

578
00:45:28,642 --> 00:45:30,678
Who does that?

579
00:45:30,842 --> 00:45:35,120
- You're really okay, though? I mean if you w...
- I'm fine.

580
00:45:35,402 --> 00:45:40,112
I just... don't understand how
that person used to be my best friend.

581
00:45:40,282 --> 00:45:42,352
My boyfriend, no less.

582
00:45:42,522 --> 00:45:44,035
I don't know.

583
00:45:46,922 --> 00:45:49,516
- What about me?
- What?

584
00:45:50,002 --> 00:45:53,199
- Do you ever feel that way about me?
- Are you kidding me?

585
00:45:54,085 --> 00:45:55,795
Why the fuck would you say that?

586
00:45:56,642 --> 00:46:00,635
I just wonder whether this is
the right time for us. You know?

587
00:46:00,802 --> 00:46:02,997
No, I don't know.

588
00:46:04,442 --> 00:46:07,002
Look... tonight made me
realize something.

589
00:46:07,682 --> 00:46:12,676
Sometimes it's not just about getting over the person.
It's about getting over what they did to you.

590
00:46:12,842 --> 00:46:14,992
And what do you mean by that?

591
00:46:15,162 --> 00:46:16,993
I could hear you guys in there.

592
00:46:18,962 --> 00:46:22,841
- I mean, you sounded so upset, so hurt, and...
- Yeah, so?

593
00:46:23,002 --> 00:46:26,199
So— so maybe you're
not ready for this, Trevor.

594
00:46:26,482 --> 00:46:29,554
- And that's for you to decide.
- No, I...

595
00:46:32,042 --> 00:46:34,681
Look, I know how you feel about me.

596
00:46:36,282 --> 00:46:38,113
I just want to let your know
you have an out.

597
00:46:38,522 --> 00:46:40,433
Are you breaking up with me?

598
00:46:41,242 --> 00:46:45,030
- No.
- Good, well, neither am I, so...

599
00:46:45,202 --> 00:46:48,717
- Do you get what I'm saying, though?
- Yeah, I get it.

600
00:46:50,402 --> 00:46:53,599
Listen, I just want to go inside, okay.
Good night.

601
00:46:56,522 --> 00:46:57,841
Trevor ...

602
00:47:08,522 --> 00:47:12,754
Look, I'm sure he's just freaked out,
all that yelling and screaming. He'll get over it.

603
00:47:12,922 --> 00:47:16,995
It's not even that, I mean,
he thinks I still have feelings for Darrell.

604
00:47:17,162 --> 00:47:20,438
- Do you?
- How could you even ask me that?

605
00:47:22,442 --> 00:47:26,151
After all you've been through, some time apart
could be a good thing. Ephram might be right.

606
00:47:26,602 --> 00:47:28,752
I don't understand this, I mean...

607
00:47:29,042 --> 00:47:33,752
I've going through so much because of Darrell,
and now, even though I've walked away...

608
00:47:34,602 --> 00:47:36,274
It's just not fair.

609
00:47:36,442 --> 00:47:38,876
- Life's not fair.
- What's that supposed to mean?

610
00:47:39,042 --> 00:47:43,752
- It's not a riddle. I'm sure you can figure it out.
- Whoa, what is your problem?

611
00:47:43,922 --> 00:47:47,995
Do you ever think that maybe someone else
is going through something too, besides you?

612
00:47:48,162 --> 00:47:49,515
Do you ever think about that?

613
00:47:49,682 --> 00:47:52,640
- I get that this is hard on Ephram, too.
- Wrong!

614
00:47:52,802 --> 00:47:54,997
- Excuse me?
- Not Ephram. Try again.

615
00:47:55,406 --> 00:47:57,574
Um... okay...

616
00:47:57,694 --> 00:48:01,197
Andie, if there's something wrong,
by all means, tell me.

617
00:48:02,962 --> 00:48:05,396
And when would I
have time to do that?

618
00:48:05,562 --> 00:48:09,680
I mean, here, at the Trevor Holden show,
we only have time for one person's problems.

619
00:48:09,842 --> 00:48:11,594
You're kidding me, right?

620
00:48:11,762 --> 00:48:15,914
I mean have you missed tonight's events?
My ex just came over and ruined my party.

621
00:48:16,082 --> 00:48:18,152
OUR party, actually.

622
00:48:18,842 --> 00:48:22,755
And that's kind of my point.
I've pretty much run out of sympathy for you.

623
00:48:22,922 --> 00:48:25,356
I don't know what
your fucking problem is...

624
00:48:25,522 --> 00:48:28,559
but I doubt it gives you the right
to be such a stupid cunt.

625
00:48:37,522 --> 00:48:39,478
What the fuck was that?

626
00:48:40,562 --> 00:48:43,679
Shouldn't you, like,
run after him or something?

627
00:48:47,842 --> 00:48:52,472

Okay, so, what do you think
needs to happen?

632
00:51:44,802 --> 00:51:48,272
- And don't say "sleep."
- How the fuck should I know?

633
00:51:48,802 --> 00:51:52,238
- Maybe you just need to get plugged.
- "Plugged"?

634
00:51:52,402 --> 00:51:56,156
- Yeah, like butt sex.
- Oh my God. Do you even have a soul?

635

Please, I got rid of that
a long time ago.

- Do you want me to find you someone here.
- Um, yeah, I'm dating Ephram?

637
00:52:03,442 --> 00:52:08,232
I think that you actually have to return someone's
phone calls for it to really be considered dating.

638
00:52:09,362 --> 00:52:11,592
Why do I even talk to you?

639

- Yeah... I can't see.
- Guess who.

648
00:52:54,002 --> 00:52:55,993
Just a... a guy.

649
00:52:57,362 --> 00:53:02,390
- Oh my God, you don't even know his name.
- Well, of course I know his name, I j...

650
00:53:03,882 --> 00:53:05,793
Yeah, I don't know. [both laugh]

651
00:53:05,962 --> 00:53:07,759
You're sick!

652
00:53:08,202 --> 00:53:10,272
I think I'm about to be.

653
00:53:13,402 --> 00:53:17,441
- I'm so glad you forced me out of the house.
- I know, right?

654
00:53:19,682 --> 00:53:22,833
So are we going to talk about
whatever happened between us?

655
00:53:24,202 --> 00:53:25,840
I don't know.

656
00:53:26,162 --> 00:53:29,837
- I guess if you want.
- It's just...

657
00:53:30,042 --> 00:53:33,273
Okay, I can't tiptoe around this.

658
00:53:33,442 --> 00:53:37,913
Were you just pissed off at me the other night,
or this this, like, deeper.

659
00:53:38,882 --> 00:53:41,840
- No.
- No to which one?

660
00:53:42,442 --> 00:53:43,795
Listen...

661
00:53:43,962 --> 00:53:45,190
I don't know.

662
00:53:45,362 --> 00:53:51,312
I just had... way too much to drink and
I shouldn't have said what I said.

663
00:53:52,482 --> 00:53:54,757
I mean. is that what I'm like?

664
00:53:56,242 --> 00:54:00,633
Selfish... self-centered... egomaniacal?

665
00:54:01,722 --> 00:54:04,282
- You CAN stop me at any time,
- No.

666
00:54:05,682 --> 00:54:07,479
Not always.

667
00:54:07,922 --> 00:54:09,355
I'm joking.

668
00:54:09,522 --> 00:54:13,276
Trevor, it really...
wasn't even about you.

669
00:54:13,642 --> 00:54:17,681
I just have a lot...
on my mind.

670
00:54:17,962 --> 00:54:23,082
And, um...
I'm sorry I wasn't a better friend.

671
00:54:23,242 --> 00:54:25,802
Hey, no. I'm sorry.

672
00:54:25,962 --> 00:54:28,601
Shut up and give me a hug.

673
00:54:32,722 --> 00:54:38,319
Okay, so I'll let you know as soon as I hear...
Yeah, I love you too. Bye.

674
00:54:39,082 --> 00:54:40,674
I'm bearing gifts.

675
00:54:41,322 --> 00:54:42,914
- What is it?
- Thai.

676
00:54:44,002 --> 00:54:45,355
Thanks.

677
00:54:55,522 --> 00:54:56,841
Get in here.

678
00:54:57,362 --> 00:55:00,513
- I tried to call but you didn't answer, so...
- Yeah.

679
00:55:00,682 --> 00:55:01,831
Sorry.

680
00:55:03,562 --> 00:55:06,793
- Who was on the phone?
- My mom. - Oh.

681
00:55:06,913 --> 00:55:08,311
How's she doing?

682
00:55:08,431 --> 00:55:11,058
She's fine. She's complaining
about the heat in New York,

683
00:55:11,178 --> 00:55:15,519
and how my dad won't pay to have
an air conditioner installed, because he thinks it's...

684
00:55:15,802 --> 00:55:19,158
Anyway, I don't know why I'm
telling you this. So, shall we eat?

685
00:55:19,278 --> 00:55:21,842
Yeah... um...

686
00:55:21,962 --> 00:55:24,874
I got you Pad See-ew...

687
00:55:25,166 --> 00:55:27,603
and... uh...

688
00:55:28,242 --> 00:55:29,914
steamed mussels...

689
00:55:31,122 --> 00:55:35,115
oh, and that gross soup that you like.
- Thanks.

690
00:55:42,882 --> 00:55:47,080
So, what was it like, the whole, uh,
nuclear family thing growing up?

691
00:55:47,242 --> 00:55:48,914
What do you mean?

692
00:55:49,442 --> 00:55:52,115
Never mind.
Stupid question.

693
00:55:52,402 --> 00:55:55,075
I've seen enough sitcoms to know.

694
00:55:56,002 --> 00:56:00,553
I guess I'm pretty lucky. I really don't know
what I would have done without them.

695
00:56:03,362 --> 00:56:05,478
I think you'll like them.

696
00:56:05,882 --> 00:56:08,601
At least I hope you will,
when you meet them.

697
00:56:08,762 --> 00:56:10,912
Am I meeting them soon?

698
00:56:11,082 --> 00:56:14,916
- I didn't realize they were coming to town.
- I meant, in the future...

699
00:56:15,082 --> 00:56:17,721
that is, if there's going to be one.

700
00:56:19,362 --> 00:56:22,035
Yeah, uh...
about that...

701
00:56:23,442 --> 00:56:26,036
Look, I want to apologize.

702
00:56:26,642 --> 00:56:29,475
I didn't mean to be
such a dick after the party.

703
00:56:29,642 --> 00:56:32,554
I know you were just trying to help.

704
00:56:32,962 --> 00:56:35,715
You have nothing to worry about.

705
00:56:36,002 --> 00:56:38,755
I really do want us to be together.

706
00:56:40,922 --> 00:56:42,196
Good.

707
00:56:43,242 --> 00:56:48,600
- You don't know how glad I am to hear you say that.
- And... I'm sorry if I made you question that.

708
00:56:48,762 --> 00:56:53,313
- No, you didn't. It's just that it's rea...
- Because, I know that I have this tendency to sort of...

709
00:56:53,482 --> 00:56:56,952
- I know. - ... to be really neurotic.
- I know you do.

710
00:56:57,122 --> 00:57:01,161
- And just sometimes it, like...
- It's what makes me love you, like...

711
00:57:01,682 --> 00:57:02,831
What?

712
00:57:07,082 --> 00:57:11,360
Trevor, I'm...
I'm falling in love with you.

713
00:57:15,290 --> 00:57:20,148
[sound of Trevor's heart beating,
continues through the bathroom scene]

714
00:57:25,842 --> 00:57:28,151
Trevor, what the fuck?

715
00:57:29,042 --> 00:57:31,158
I don't understand, I mean...

716
00:57:31,642 --> 00:57:35,112
are you okay?
Is everything okay?

717
00:57:35,642 --> 00:57:37,041
Yeah...

718
00:57:37,202 --> 00:57:40,717
I mean...
I just don't feel well.

719
00:57:41,322 --> 00:57:45,235
- I think it's the food.
- We haven't even started eating yet.

720
00:57:45,402 --> 00:57:49,361
- I'm feeling so weird.
- Look, if this is about what I said, I...

721
00:57:50,042 --> 00:57:50,918
No, it's...

722
00:57:52,442 --> 00:57:56,230
It's just that, like...
the smell of it or something...

723
00:57:59,402 --> 00:58:03,156
- Okay.
- I'm sure it'll pass.

724
00:58:03,722 --> 00:58:06,714
I just need to stay
in here a minute.

725
00:58:08,002 --> 00:58:10,596
Away from the food.

726
00:58:11,882 --> 00:58:14,601
Oh, look, all I was saying is...

727
00:58:17,842 --> 00:58:21,118
You know what? I'm not doing this
through a bathroom door.

728
00:58:21,238 --> 00:58:24,259
[heartbeat sounds end]

729
00:58:48,162 --> 00:58:50,995
TREVOR: Okay, listen...
EPHRAM: I didn't mean to snap at you...

730
00:58:52,026 --> 00:58:54,452
I mean, we were literally
just resolving things, and then

731
00:58:54,572 --> 00:58:58,279
I go and put all this pressure on you
by saying that I love you.

732
00:58:58,802 --> 00:59:01,714
It's just that I rea—
- It's nothing.

733
00:59:02,482 --> 00:59:04,393
- It's nothing?

734
00:59:05,722 --> 00:59:10,557
You know what? I don't even know why I'm apologizing.
I'm acting like I did something wrong.

735
00:59:11,322 --> 00:59:14,712
You know, I think things have been
pretty amazing between us.

736
00:59:14,882 --> 00:59:18,431
And you've pretty much led me to believe
that you feel the same way...

737
00:59:18,602 --> 00:59:22,515
so it's only natural... for our relationship
to progress to this level.

738
00:59:23,162 --> 00:59:24,356
Right?

739
00:59:24,522 --> 00:59:29,232
You can't seem to handle that, Trevor, which is
exactly what I was talking about at your party.

740
00:59:30,082 --> 00:59:33,154
So tell me, what the hell
am I apologizing for?

741
00:59:35,303 --> 00:59:39,751
Wow, Trev...
Thanks for clarifying.

742
00:59:39,922 --> 00:59:43,597
Hey, don't look at— Don't do that.
I just don't know what to say.

743
00:59:43,762 --> 00:59:47,181
Please try and thing of something,
because I can't keep filling in the blanks for you.

744
00:59:47,301 --> 00:59:48,715
- Okay, you're wrong!
- What!?

745
00:59:49,562 --> 00:59:53,237
Not about how you feel, okay,
about how I feel.

746
00:59:53,402 --> 00:59:56,360
I just... I want to do this
the right way.

747
01:00:10,642 --> 01:00:13,281
I guess I just
have to accept that.

748
01:00:21,522 --> 01:00:24,116
I'm sorry about what I said.

749
01:00:27,685 --> 01:00:28,682
[sigh]

750
01:00:28,802 --> 01:00:30,838
Yeah, but... you meant it.

751
01:00:35,762 --> 01:00:39,914
And in a fucked-up sort of way...

752
01:00:41,002 --> 01:00:43,197
it was pretty romantic.

753
01:00:44,482 --> 01:00:45,915
Alright.

754
01:00:47,282 --> 01:00:48,954
Seriously.

755
01:00:51,482 --> 01:00:53,712
Seriously?

756
01:01:10,082 --> 01:01:11,515
I don't get you.

757
01:01:11,682 --> 01:01:16,039
You said you don't know how I feel,
so I'm just trying to clarify.

758
01:01:50,562 --> 01:01:52,917
Can't do this right now.

759
01:02:01,762 --> 01:02:03,413
Could you get off me?

760
01:02:04,082 --> 01:02:05,720
Please.

this one's mildly uplifting.

812
01:08:37,485 --> 01:08:42,789
♫ You can't help me. ♫

813
01:08:44,122 --> 01:08:45,999
What you reading?

814
01:08:46,922 --> 01:08:51,473
An article about the learning habits
of macaques vs. humans.

815
01:08:52,402 --> 01:08:55,280
- They're monkeys, the macaques.
- Mhmm.

816
01:08:58,322 --> 01:08:59,960
So, tell me...

817
01:09:01,783 --> 01:09:03,237
Yessss?

818
01:09:04,122 --> 01:09:07,080
- What are your thoughts on New York?
- What are you getting at?

819
01:09:07,242 --> 01:09:11,440
- I think we should go there.
- Okay, yeah, sure.

820
01:09:12,602 --> 01:09:15,321
I was thinking sooner,
rather than later.

821
01:09:15,482 --> 01:09:19,236
- I'd have to see if I could get my shifts changed.
- Trevor...

822
01:09:19,442 --> 01:09:24,072
I know this is bad timing... or maybe
it's perfect timing, I don't know, but...

823
01:09:25,682 --> 01:09:29,800
I got offered a position... in New York.
They want me to start in 2 weeks and I mean...

824
01:09:29,962 --> 01:09:33,398
this hospital...
- Yeah, I know.

825
01:09:33,562 --> 01:09:38,238
It'd be such a great opportunity for me,
and it'd be closer to my parents, and...

826
01:09:38,562 --> 01:09:42,714
Trevor, I know this might not seem
like the best thing right now, but I...

827
01:09:42,882 --> 01:09:47,751
No, it... sounds great.
I mean, it's good news, right?

828
01:09:49,442 --> 01:09:52,878
I'd only take the job
if you'd come with me.

829
01:09:54,122 --> 01:09:57,398
ANDIE: He what?
TREVOR: He asked me to go with him.

830
01:09:57,562 --> 01:10:00,952
ANDIE: You mean like drive with him,
help him get settled, all that stuff?

831
01:10:01,122 --> 01:10:04,637
TREVOR: Yeah, but I mean.
ultimately he wants me to move to New York.

832
01:10:04,802 --> 01:10:06,872
I can't breathe.

833
01:10:07,082 --> 01:10:09,721
- Are my lips blue?
- What? No.

834
01:10:09,882 --> 01:10:12,874
Good. These blue lollipops
always do that.

835
01:10:13,642 --> 01:10:17,954
- What do you mean he wants you to move to New York?
- Do I have to answer that somehow?

836
01:10:18,122 --> 01:10:20,442
I mean, you can't just pick up
and move to New York.

837
01:10:20,562 --> 01:10:24,555
Just because Ephram got some position doesn't mean he
can expect you to follow him anywhere and everywhere.

838
01:10:24,722 --> 01:10:28,317
He didn't ask me to follow him anywhere—
or everywhere, for that matter...

839
01:10:28,562 --> 01:10:30,359
just to New York.

840
01:10:30,479 --> 01:10:32,400
Well, Jake's right. You can't just...

841
01:10:32,520 --> 01:10:36,002
leave everything behind in L.A.
I mean, you have a life, too.

842
01:10:36,122 --> 01:10:39,034
Really? If you haven't noticed,
I don't have much going on here.

843
01:10:39,202 --> 01:10:43,798
- Andie, wreck the car.
- Trevor, you haven't even known this guy that long.

844
01:10:43,962 --> 01:10:46,157
Now you're just going to
move to New York with him?

845
01:10:46,322 --> 01:10:50,031
"This guy"? Andie, Ephram and I
have been dating for months, okay?

846
01:10:50,202 --> 01:10:54,832
It's not just some guy. He's been through
so much with Darrell and me.

847
01:10:55,002 --> 01:10:56,845
Well, yeah, but now Darrell's dead.

848
01:10:56,965 --> 01:11:00,347
So, don't you think conveniently
moving to New York is a little like running away.

849
01:11:00,467 --> 01:11:02,114
Andie, come on.

850
01:11:03,882 --> 01:11:08,433
I never said that I was going with him, okay.
Just telling you guys that he asked.

851
01:11:09,162 --> 01:11:13,838
Ephram asking me to move brings up
a very good point. He even said it.

852
01:11:14,002 --> 01:11:18,757
I don't have much going on here.
No career, no family besides you guys.

853
01:11:18,922 --> 01:11:23,040
Basically, when it comes to L.A.,
I'm not even on the map.

854
01:11:23,202 --> 01:11:24,954
He said that about you?

855
01:11:25,202 --> 01:11:28,638
Well, just that I don't have
a career holding me back.

856
01:11:28,802 --> 01:11:31,032
I kind of added the rest for effect.

857
01:11:31,202 --> 01:11:33,955
But it's true. I mean,
you know it is.

858
01:11:34,402 --> 01:11:35,960
Alright.

859
01:11:36,562 --> 01:11:38,200
You're right.

860
01:11:43,682 --> 01:11:46,992
You know it's really cold there, right?
Like, in the winter?

861
01:11:47,362 --> 01:11:48,954
Oh my God.

862
01:12:03,962 --> 01:12:06,078
Hey, Trev, can I talk to you
about something?

863
01:12:06,322 --> 01:12:10,235
No, I'm really busy here...
Of course, go on.

864
01:12:13,882 --> 01:12:16,157
Andie, what's wrong?

865
01:12:16,642 --> 01:12:21,557
Do you know what? I shouldn't even be
doing this right now. I— It's not fair to you.

866
01:12:21,762 --> 01:12:23,718
Shut up!
What is it?

867
01:12:37,842 --> 01:12:40,151
[crying] I don't even know
how to say this...

868
01:12:42,682 --> 01:12:44,434
Oh, God.

869
01:12:47,482 --> 01:12:54,274
I... tested positive for HIV when, uh,
I went to the clinic with you guys.

870
01:12:55,682 --> 01:12:57,991
[crying] I'm HIV positive.

871
01:13:00,162 --> 01:13:01,959
I'm...

872
01:13:02,282 --> 01:13:04,273
That doesn't make sense.

873
01:13:04,642 --> 01:13:07,714
How could...
How could you get it?

874
01:13:08,002 --> 01:13:09,560
From who?

875
01:13:10,762 --> 01:13:12,514
There was this guy...

876
01:13:12,909 --> 01:13:16,279
- What guy, Andie?
- Just some guy.

877
01:13:16,442 --> 01:13:20,560
I got really drunk and...
slept with someone...

878
01:13:21,202 --> 01:13:24,433
and I don't even
fucking remember it...

879
01:13:26,882 --> 01:13:31,910
and I guess...
he didn't wear a condom or...

880
01:13:32,322 --> 01:13:34,836
maybe it broke.

881
01:13:35,802 --> 01:13:37,918
[crying] I don't know.

882
01:13:39,042 --> 01:13:41,476
Why don't I know!?

883
01:13:47,562 --> 01:13:49,951
You can't leave, Trevor!

884
01:13:50,071 --> 01:13:59,012
[Andie crying]

885
01:13:59,132 --> 01:14:08,950
[yell]

886
01:14:25,202 --> 01:14:27,636
That has to be
the best stir-fry I've ever had.

887
01:14:27,802 --> 01:14:30,680
You think anything you put
in your mouth is amazing.

888
01:14:31,042 --> 01:14:32,760
Shut up!

889
01:14:34,562 --> 01:14:36,200
Thanks, though.

890
01:14:36,362 --> 01:14:39,559
Seriously, except my mouth
is kind of on fire.

891
01:14:41,962 --> 01:14:46,717
Sorry, I forgot to tell you,
I made that for a real man.

892
01:14:47,242 --> 01:14:50,632
I think you know
I'm a real man.

893
01:14:56,082 --> 01:14:57,959
Hey Trevor...

894
01:14:59,322 --> 01:15:03,600
- Can I be frank.
- What am I going to be though. Ooh, can I be "Walter"?

895
01:15:03,762 --> 01:15:05,718
- Trevor ...
- Sorry.

896
01:15:05,882 --> 01:15:08,680
- Really? Walter?
- Yeah, I don't know.

897
01:15:08,842 --> 01:15:10,753
Not so much.

898
01:15:11,762 --> 01:15:13,559
Go ahead, be frank.

899
01:15:13,722 --> 01:15:17,874
Damn it, I should have said "baked beans."
"Frank and beans."

900
01:15:18,362 --> 01:15:21,672
- Are you done?
- Sorry.

901
01:15:21,842 --> 01:15:26,358
- Please, proceed.
- Seriously.

902
01:15:26,882 --> 01:15:28,520
for you now.

903
01:15:30,122 --> 01:15:34,718
About New York, I'm not trying to
put pressure on you, in any way...

904
01:15:35,402 --> 01:15:39,998
I just want to make sure we're on the same page.
- What number? - Damn it, Trevor, please.

905
01:15:40,162 --> 01:15:43,552
I'm really sorry.
I'm blaming the wine, I don't know.

906
01:15:46,802 --> 01:15:50,477
I'll be serious.
Honest.

907
01:15:51,162 --> 01:15:53,198
This is the thing.,..

908
01:15:53,602 --> 01:15:58,630
I need you to understand that I didn't just ask you
to come to New York with me on some sort of whim.

909
01:16:00,320 --> 01:16:02,934
The truth is, that before
they even offered me the position...

910
01:16:03,054 --> 01:16:07,274
I was already considering
what the rest of my life would be like with you.

911
01:16:07,962 --> 01:16:10,760
So, when New York came up...

912
01:16:11,642 --> 01:16:13,758
it wasn't a question.

913
01:16:14,722 --> 01:16:18,112
I just couldn't picture myself there
without you.

914
01:16:19,762 --> 01:16:22,356
I can't picture me
without you.

915
01:16:25,082 --> 01:16:27,038
But Ephram...

916
01:16:27,202 --> 01:16:31,878
hypothetically...
if I were to decide not to go...

917
01:16:32,602 --> 01:16:35,321
you can't stay here with me.

918
01:16:37,762 --> 01:16:40,401
No, I know.

919
01:16:44,002 --> 01:16:48,996
I've already decided to take the job, and I want
nothing more than for you to come with me...

920
01:16:49,882 --> 01:16:53,591
but I'm honestly not trying to tell you
how to make your decision. I just...

921
01:16:56,322 --> 01:17:01,601
I didn't want you thinking that my decision
to ask you to come... wasn't a sad one.

922
01:17:06,602 --> 01:17:08,513
I want you with me.

923
01:17:16,282 --> 01:17:18,113
You know I love you.

924
01:17:42,562 --> 01:17:47,556
TREVOR: It's this feeling like
life's just happening... to you...

925
01:17:48,562 --> 01:17:51,520
as if you're not really part of
what's going on.

926
01:17:56,562 --> 01:18:00,191
We're constantly dreaming up
different realities for ourselves, but...

927
01:18:01,202 --> 01:18:05,115
what happens when the reality
seems more like a dream than anything?

928
01:18:06,002 --> 01:18:08,516
You watch yourself living...

929
01:18:08,682 --> 01:18:10,912
and it's like you're helpless...

930
01:18:11,242 --> 01:18:13,551
You can't do anything to change it.

931
01:18:18,682 --> 01:18:23,119
And even knowing, that you're not alone
in this feeling, is no consolation at all.

932
01:18:23,522 --> 01:18:25,513
The fact remains...

933
01:18:25,922 --> 01:18:29,756
It's just no good
sleepwalking through life.

934
01:18:39,322 --> 01:18:42,155
What happened?
Are you in trouble?

935
01:18:42,322 --> 01:18:45,632
- No, I quit.
- Did not!

936
01:18:47,082 --> 01:18:48,071
Way.

937
01:18:49,882 --> 01:18:51,395
TREVOR: As a child...

938
01:18:51,562 --> 01:18:56,761
I always regarded riding in the car
as this sort of... emotional experience.

939
01:18:57,482 --> 01:19:00,121
My father and I
never really got along, so...

940
01:19:00,282 --> 01:19:03,160
when he would pick me up from somewhere
to take me home...

941
01:19:03,322 --> 01:19:06,712
I always felt like he was taking me away
from the places I would rather be.

942
01:19:08,882 --> 01:19:12,841
It was as if I was somehow being forced
to leave something behind.

943
01:19:13,082 --> 01:19:15,471
A part of myself, maybe.

944
01:19:17,842 --> 01:19:22,233
I would spend the entire car ride home,
turned around in the back seat...

945
01:19:22,402 --> 01:19:25,712
watching my happiness
disappear into the distance.

946
01:19:28,202 --> 01:19:30,557
I should probably get out of the car, huh?

947
01:19:32,922 --> 01:19:34,116
Thanks, guys.

948
01:19:34,442 --> 01:19:37,514
I just...
sort of...

949
01:19:39,922 --> 01:19:42,516
TREVOR: I needed to...
ANDIE: Of course.

950
01:19:43,602 --> 01:19:46,162
Go get 'em, tiger.

951
01:19:47,842 --> 01:19:52,757
- This isn't really a time for that phrase, is it?
- No, Jake, it's not.

952
01:19:57,242 --> 01:19:59,278
I hate you guys.

953
01:20:30,962 --> 01:20:32,600
Hi, yourself.

954
01:20:43,682 --> 01:20:45,195
Come here.

955
01:20:53,122 --> 01:20:54,441
Do you hate me?

956
01:20:54,602 --> 01:20:57,639
What? Being late?
Of course not!

957
01:20:57,802 --> 01:20:59,076
Shut up.

958
01:21:00,922 --> 01:21:05,313
I could never hate you.
Not for anything.

959
01:21:07,042 --> 01:21:08,998
- It's just...
- Hey...

960
01:21:11,882 --> 01:21:14,840
What we're doing is good.
I know it.

961
01:21:17,682 --> 01:21:21,994
As hard as this is to do,
I know it's right.

962
01:21:23,642 --> 01:21:26,076
Isn't that supposed
to make it easier?

963
01:21:27,562 --> 01:21:30,872
The best decision is hard,
never easy.

964
01:21:31,042 --> 01:21:35,001
But it'll get easier...
eventually.

965
01:21:37,842 --> 01:21:39,673
It has to.

966
01:21:50,162 --> 01:21:52,676
I love you so much.

967
01:21:54,362 --> 01:21:56,671
- Then we c—
- No.

968
01:21:57,002 --> 01:22:00,358
I just need you to know that...
okay?

969
01:22:03,362 --> 01:22:04,761
Okay.

970
01:22:25,562 --> 01:22:28,998
TREVOR: It was all I could do to keep myself
from jumping out of the car.

971
01:22:29,162 --> 01:22:31,722
If I could no longer be
where I had been...

972
01:22:31,882 --> 01:22:35,238
then at least I could turn my back
on where I was headed.

973
01:22:38,202 --> 01:22:40,477
It was like that
for as long as I can remember....

974
01:22:40,642 --> 01:22:44,078
until one day when
my father finally said something about it.

975
01:22:44,962 --> 01:22:46,315
He said, "Son...

976
01:22:46,482 --> 01:22:51,397
moving forward doesn't always mean
leaving something behind."

977
01:22:54,922 --> 01:22:58,437
It's probably the most profound thing
he's ever said.

978
01:22:58,602 --> 01:23:02,311
Only it too me this long
to finally hear him.

979
01:23:04,362 --> 01:23:07,320
It was the same then
as it is today.

980
01:23:10,882 --> 01:23:13,476
I can't turn around anymore...

981
01:23:13,842 --> 01:23:16,595
and for the first time in my life...

982
01:23:16,762 --> 01:23:20,880
I finally feel like I'm looking
in the right direction.

♫  ["Rewind"] ♫

985
01:27:27,577 --> 01:27:29,295
It makes me love you like...

986
01:27:30,177 --> 01:27:31,132
What?

987
01:27:33,696 --> 01:27:36,407
- I don't blame you.
- You... are not my fault.

988
01:27:36,800 --> 01:27:38,132
Open the fucking door!

989
01:27:45,976 --> 01:27:48,134
I can't keep filling in the blanks for you!

990
01:27:48,937 --> 01:27:50,006
You're fucking high?

991
01:27:50,137 --> 01:27:52,935
You come over here to tell me
to help you to change and you're high?
