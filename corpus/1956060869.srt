00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:04,198
.

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:05,459
You're having triplets.

3
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:07,159
Every family has a story.

4
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:10,899
You lost a child
and rolled out of my hospital

5
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:13,199
with three babies just the same.

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,899
They are heartwarming...
I love our life.

7
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,559
...and heartbreaking moments...

8
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:19,329
I need you to wake up!
The house is on fire!

9
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:22,259
My children lost their father
when they were 17.

10
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:24,559
...and relationships
that transcend time.

11
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,329
Big Three.
Big Three!

12
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:27,330
Big Three!
Big Three!

13
00:00:27,331 --> 00:00:28,599
Big Three!

14
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:31,299
Tonight we celebrate
the Pearson family...

15
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:33,759
We all felt very early on that
we were part

16
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,159
of something special.

17
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,699
...and what they've meant
to audiences everywhere.

18
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:39,299
I met a woman on the street.

19
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:42,029
She said, "I adopted this baby
because of you."

20
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:44,859
We'll go behind the scenes
and back to the beginning

21
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:47,499
with neverbeforeseen
casting tapes...

22
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:50,299
Do you know how much
I love you?

23
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:51,999
Yeah, you've made
it very clear.

24
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,259
...and take a look forward

25
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:56,059
with an exclusive preview
from season 3.

26
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:58,360
Season 3.

00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:11,929
First came...?
Me!

30
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:13,229
And Dad said...?
"Gee!"

31
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:14,259
And then came...?
Me!

32
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:15,459
And Mom said...?
"Whee!"

33
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:17,299
And then came...?
Me.

34
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:18,160
And we said...?

35
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:19,859
"That's three."
Big Three?

36
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:21,359
Big Three!
Big Three!

37
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,759
When I first read
the pilot script, it was

38
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:26,199
I knew right away this was
something that was special.

39
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,029
You don't get opportunities
like this.

40
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:29,759
I started writing "This Is Us"
as a film.

41
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:33,259
It was originally about seven
or eight kids all linked

42
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:35,159
by a birthday at 36 years old,

43
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:37,429
and I figured at the end
of the film you would reveal

44
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:39,559
that one of the couples
was their parents.

45
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,329
Only after putting it away
for quite a while

46
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:43,459
and the characters
kept sticking with me

47
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:45,829
I thought, "Huh, I wonder
if making it a television show

48
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:47,499
where I don't need to have
a beginning, a middle,

49
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:50,099
and an end but just
an continuous story of a family

50
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,299
would hold a little better?"

51
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:53,329
And so I kind of
picked it back up,

52
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:55,829
I shaved off four
or five of the characters,

53
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:58,059
and finished it out
as a television show.

54
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:02,559
My friend called me and said,
"Man, I just read this thing.

55
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,459
I think Dan Fogelman
just wrote you."

56
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:07,159
And I'm like,
"What are you talking about?"

57
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,829
So he sent it to me, and I read

58
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:11,729
I remember reading it,
and I thought, "That's me.

59
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:13,199
Oh, my God, he wrote me.
That's so cool.

60
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,159
That's so like me.
I'm Jack."

61
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,629
And then Uh, and then
I flipped a few more pages,

62
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:18,929
then I saw that I'm
I'm actually Kevin.

63
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:21,459
I love the script. I think
it's great very funny.

64
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:23,229
I've got no notes, no questions.

65
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:25,159
I was sort of at a point
in my career

66
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:30,129
where I had done pilot
after pilot after pilot

67
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:32,129
and nothing gained traction.

68
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:35,399
And it wasn't until I read
this script that, like,

69
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,129
something clicked in me
and I thought,

70
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:39,899
"I have to do whatever it takes
to be a part of this."

71
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:43,759
Did a series prior to this,
a show called "Mr. Robot,"

72
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,259
and I was like,
"Wow, I got a show

73
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:47,899
that I'm actually gonna be on
for a while," you know?

74
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:50,629
And I was killed off in the

75
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:53,629
the first episode
of the second season.

76
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:56,499
And I was just sad and bitter
and telling my friends,

77
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:57,859
"It's never gonna
happen for me."

78
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:00,029
There was a whole year
where nothing was happening.

79
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:01,729
I had 81 cents
in my bank account,

80
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:03,329
and I was gonna move
back home to Florida

81
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:04,799
to teach preschool again,

82
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,899
and this script came about,
and my really good friend

83
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:10,159
was like,
"You are this character.

84
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,829
Like, you have to read it."

85
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:13,529
I'm like, "Okay, yeah.

86
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:15,759
Like I'm gonna be reading
a pilot

87
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,399
and ever auditioning
for a pilot.

88
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,799
Like, are you k Dan Fogelman?
No. Not gonna happen."

89
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,529
We are a hot mess, huh?

90
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:23,559
Yeah.

91
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,959
Big Three?

92
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,029
Big Three.

93
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:30,399
The casting process was one
of those perfect dream scenarios

94
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,199
where I got to cast
everybody I wanted to cast.

95
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,929
I'm gonna need everyone
in this room to believe me

96
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:40,800
when I say that only good things
are gonna happen here today.

97
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:44,759
Actually, no I don't just
want you to believe it.

98
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,259
I want you to know it.

99
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:47,629
I read the scene,
and I could see Dan

100
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:51,359
in the back of the room
literally just, like, smiling.

101
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,899
I was thinking to myself,
"Okay, I think, uh

102
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,759
I think I must have
done my job."

103

[ Laughs ]

104
00:03:58,130 --> 00:04:00,299
So, I'm gonna need everyone
in this room to believe me

105
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:03,230
when I say that only good things
are gonna happen here today.

106
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:08,499
Actually, II don't just
want you to believe it.

107
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,199
I want you to know it.

108
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,499
I remember going to the
audition, and, like,

109
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,229
the birds were birdier,
the sky was bluer.

110
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:14,629
I was like,
"The day is different!

111
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:16,099
It's gonna be amazing!"

112
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:17,699
I had a really nice time
tonight, Toby.

113
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:19,399
Thank you.

114
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:22,029
So, that's it?

115
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:23,599
Wait, what do you mean?

116
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,829
I mean, you're not gonna
invite me in

117
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:27,229
for a nightcap or anything?

118
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:29,059
[ Laughs ]

119
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,429
Cute.

120
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:31,999
And I get there and I'm like,
"Wha, wha, wha,"

121
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,729
and I see all the same girls,

122
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:35,899
and, you know, signed up,
and we're like, "Oh, hi!"

123
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,229
and we're all very kind
to each other,

124
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:39,829
but we're all like,
"We want a job.

125
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:41,559
We want this amazing job."

126
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,559
I had a really nice time
tonight, Toby.

127
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,599
Thank you.
Yeah.

128
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,859
Wait, what?
No, no, no.

129
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:47,759
What, that's it?

130
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,259
What do you mean?

131
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:52,359
I mean, you're not gonna
invite me in for a...

132
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:57,059
a nightcap or a handy
or something?

133
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:59,359
Cute.
I am. Thank you.

134
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,259
And I was still working on
"The People v. O.J."

135
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:04,099
at the time, and my
representation presented me

136
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:06,059
with this script, and I read it.

137
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:08,899
And I was reading it while I was
at the prosecution table,

138
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,229
like, in between takes.

139
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:11,929
I was like, "Who's this guy,
Dan Fogelman?"

140
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:13,899
I look him up
I was like, "Crazy Stupid Love"?

141
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:16,629
Like, that's my joint, right?

142
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:18,999
It was the best network
television pilot

143
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,059
that I had ever read.

144
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:21,899
I found him.

145
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,559
My father.

146
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,829
When?
Last week.

147
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:26,229
Last week?
And you didn't tell me?!

148
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:27,699
Don't be mad.
I'm mad!

149
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:29,199
Damn.
Yeah, damn.

150
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,899
Just before I got the show,
I remember thinking

151
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:34,299
that maybe it's time to do
something completely different,

152
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,599
so I was, um I was like,

153
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:40,199
gonna move to Montreal and,
like, work in a coffee shop,

154
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,459
and then "This Is Us" came along

155
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:44,929
literally, like,
a week or two alter.

156
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:46,659
I found him.

157
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:47,899
My father.

158
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:49,829
What? When?

159
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:52,259
I, uh, I hired a guy.

160
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:55,059
I went in very early
in the audition process.

161
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:57,229
I think I was one of the first
people that they read.

162
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:59,629
Hey.

163
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:02,059
How do you think we're doing

164
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:04,099
with parenting?

165
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:06,299
I think we're a 6, honestly.

166
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:08,459
On a sliding scale of 1 to 10,
I think we're at a 6,

167
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:09,829
and I think I'm being generous.

168
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:12,459
The feedback was
"They really liked you,

169
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:14,459
but now they're gonna go
and read a bunch of women

170
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:16,259
in New York
and across the country,

171
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:18,799
and we'll hopefully hear back
in a couple of weeks

172
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,359
once they've done that."

173
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:24,499
Hey, how do you think
we're doing so far?

174
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,999
At parenting?

On a sliding scale
of 1 through 10,

177
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:33,829
I think we're at a 6,

178
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:35,359
and I think I'm being generous.

179
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,429
About five or six weeks later,
we got a call

180
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:40,699
"Okay. They want to bring you
back in with a couple

181
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,459
of other women
and a couple of guys,

182
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:43,959
and they want to sort of
pair people up

183
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:47,499
and do what they call, like,
a 'chemistry read.'"

184
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,299
I got called in
to audition with Milo.

185
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:51,199
He was the only guy I read with,

186
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:56,959
and we sort of just instantly
had this connection.

187
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,059
Hey, kids.
Close your eyes in there.

188
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:01,829
Daddy's about to do
some terrible things to Mommy.

189
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:03,359
No.
No, no, no.

190
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,999
There's no way in hell, babe.
Mmhmm.

191
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,129
Yep.
Come on.

00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:07,360
No.

193
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:11,799
It went well, and I guess
the rest is history

194
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,329
'cause we both got the job.

195
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:15,929
I don't know, birthday
tradition is birthday tradition,

196
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:17,499
so close your eyes
in there, kids,

197
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:22,029
because Daddy's about to do some
real terrible things to Mommy.

199
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:27,299
I bet I can make that go away.

00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:28,829
There's nothing
you can say that's

201
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:30,600

00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,799

was half naked on a scale,

and I was like, "OOkay,
this is gonna be different."

206
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:42,129
Not only could you start
to see Milo as Jack,

207
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:44,529
but you couldn't possibly see
anyone else as Jack.

208
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:48,029
I think that was a pretty
magical hour of television.

209
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:51,659

from season 3

that life has to offer

224
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:34,400
and turned it into something
resembling lemonade.

225
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:39,829
Being on the pilot, I knew that

226
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:42,059
that this was a special group.

227
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:44,059
You know, there's the script,

moment for me.

Tradition is tradition.

236
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:08,359
You could start to see
Milo as Jack,

237
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,499
and then it quickly turned into

00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,359
not only could you start
to see Milo as Jack,

239
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:15,059
but you couldn't possibly see
anyone else as Jack.

240
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:16,959
And I remember that happening
with every single character

241
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,459
as I would watch them.

242
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:22,829
We knew that, like, it had all
of the makings of something...

243
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:24,629
just undeniable.

244
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:28,799
Each character had something
that you could relate to,

245
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,529
but specifically for Randall
and that first time

246
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:34,799
that he meets William
and that monologue

247
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,329
that he lets out at him
and the turn of it.

248
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:40,899
I came here today so I could
look you in the eye,

249
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:44,259
say that to you, and then get
back in my fancyass car

250
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:48,199
and finally prove to myself
and to you and to my family

251
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:51,129
who loves me that I didn't need
a thing from you

252
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:53,560
even after I knew who you were.

253
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:58,629
You want to come in?
Okay.

254
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:00,759
But what he didn't realize once
he said, "You want to come in?"

255
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,159
and he was like "okay"

256
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,159
was that he was yearning
for this connection.

257
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:08,259
He was able to access
a part of himself

258
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:11,629
that he didn't
even know was missing.

259
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:17,029
It exposes people's
vulnerabilities and secrets.

260
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:19,959
I think that's what ends up
being the success of the show.

261
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:23,499
The first scene that I ever
shot was half naked on a scale,

262
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:26,229
and I was like, "OOkay,
this is gonna be different."

263
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:28,859
The thing that was so
extraordinary about the pilot

264
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:34,099
was that it it was a twist,
basically, at the end.

265
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,699
Someone left a newborn
at my fire station.

266
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:38,900
I didn't know what to do,
so I brought him here.

267
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:44,599
Season 1's twist is that
this show exists

268
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,099
in two different time periods.

269
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:49,129
It's such a hard show to market
because the very premise

270
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:51,129
of the show that all these
people are related

271
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:53,829
in different time periods
was a secret until the premiere.

272
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:56,199
So I remember feeling so bad
for our poor cast

273
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,659
who had to go do
all these talk shows

274
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:59,259
and all these events
where they weren't allowed

275
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:00,959
to say what the show was about.

276
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,659
Mandy and I were getting off
the plane in New York

277
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:04,229
for the upfronts, you know,

278
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:07,529
the big network presentation
to advertisers and all that.

279
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:09,599
Mandy turns around from her seat

280
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,399
and she says, "There's a trailer
that got released."

281
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,899
I'm like, "Oh, cool."

282
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:14,529
You know, I pull it up,
we both watch it,

283
00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:17,429
we're both crying
just because it was doing that

284
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:19,259
to everyone, including us.

285
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:20,899
I remember being a cab.

286
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:22,459
The president of NBC texted me.

287
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:23,759
He's like,
"Something's happening

288
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,629
with the trailer right now,"

289
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:28,829
and by that afternoon
there were articles about

290
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:31,259
how it was breaking records
and all of this stuff.

291
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:35,299
I'm going to attribute it
to Milo's bare butt.

292
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:38,959
Like, I think that was just
people like seeing the bare butt

293
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,429
in the very beginning
and then just,

294
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:42,699
like, refreshing
and reloading to watch it again.

295
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:44,959
I think that's where
all the views came from.

296
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,629
One of the big concerns
when we started

297
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:50,629
was how was the audience
gonna track all of the time?

298
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:53,599
I remember feeling very strongly
that we needed to change

299
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,559
Milo's facial hair in order
to help orient the audience

300
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,129
so that it would be a marker
for the audience

301
00:11:58,130 --> 00:11:59,559
to know exactly where they are

302
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,399
until they get comfortable
inside the show.

303
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:05,459
We wanted people to experience
those other periods

304
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:08,159
with the same kind
of emotional immediacy

305
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,559
that we experience the present.

306
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:14,159
And so we don't really
shoot them differently,

307
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,659
and we don't treat them
differently.

308
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:19,129
You have three actors in some
cases playing one character

309
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:20,699
through different times
of their life.

310
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:22,699
It's really cool to see

311
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,329
a younger version,
a teenage ver

312
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:29,459
There's so many facets
to those those ages.

313
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:31,299
And because the show's
not linear,

314
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:33,099
there's so much story to tell.

315
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,759
About three weeks before
we started shooting

316
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:37,999
the first season,
I got an email from Dan saying

317
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:43,799
"I have this crazy idea
where I really want you to try

318
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,459
and play Rebecca present day,

319
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:48,429
and we're gonna get the best,
like, special effects makeup

320
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:50,129
and wigs and all of that.

321
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:54,299
And if even one person
has, like, an inkling

322
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:55,859
of where they don't buy it,

323
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:58,699
then we'll, you know,
we'll forgo that, and we'll

324
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:01,499
we'll do some incredible casting
and find, you know,

325
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,929
an older actress
to play you in those years."

326
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:08,729
I get to play this woman
from 22 to 68, um,

327
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:10,759
at every different facet
of her life.

328
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,859
It is fascinating.

329
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:14,859
It's never not challenging.

330
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:16,729
I get a call saying

331
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:20,199
"We've got to send you to
the Valley to do a makeup test."

332
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,029
I said, "Okay, you're gonna be
here for about two hours.

333
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:23,799
We're gonna do a lifecast."

334
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:27,299
A lifecast is where they mold
your entire head and shoulders

335
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:28,459
and they take a mold of you,

336
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:30,429
and then they build things
on to your face,

337
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:32,799
and I didn't understand
why I was gonna need that,

338
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,099
and I was asking
the makeup guys,

339
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:35,359
"Why are you doing a lifecast?"

340
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,729
And they said,
"We're gonna be aging you to,

341
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:39,129
you know,
70 or something like that."

342
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:40,959
"What? Why?"

343
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,299

00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:01,299
She said, "I adopted this baby
because of you,"

687
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:02,929
and I was like...

688
00:29:02,930 --> 00:29:06,160
When "The Paley Center Salutes
'This Is Us'" continues.

689
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:09,230
.

690
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:15,400
♪♪♪

691
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:20,559
No more drinking.

692
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:23,329
You can't just stop.
I can.

693
00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:25,029
For you, I can.

694
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:26,959
I'm trying to be strong here
'cause that's the gig,

695
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:29,159
but it happened to me, too.

696
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,499
You always got
special treatment.

697
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,059
Because I'm black?
No, because you're black

698
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:33,329
and you're adopted.

699
00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:35,229
Oh, yeah, hit the jackpot
with that combination.

700
00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:36,629
Couldn't have had it any easier.

701
00:29:36,630 --> 00:29:38,599
In our house, you did.
I've got to get a handle

702
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:41,159
on myself, on the weight
and on all of it.

703
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:43,559
I'm not sure you've ever
experienced anything real

704
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:45,630
your entire life.

705
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:49,629
I don't think we're taught
how to feel,

706
00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:52,059
and if we are,
it's so uncomfortable

707
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:53,629
that it's hard
to move through it,

708
00:29:53,630 --> 00:29:55,859
and so that's what is
so beautiful

709
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:58,459
about the writing in the show,
is that it's not

710
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:00,529
what happens to you,
but how you react to it.

711
00:30:00,530 --> 00:30:02,559
The breakthrough
on the show was

712
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:05,729
the first week I gathered
our very talented writers,

713
00:30:05,730 --> 00:30:07,899
saying, "Oh, no, this isn't
a soap opera.

714
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:10,729
This is what is happening
in every single person's life."

715
00:30:10,730 --> 00:30:14,529
The human experience is shaped
by love and loss and joy

716
00:30:14,530 --> 00:30:17,629
and hopes and dreams
and failure, and it makes

717
00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:19,899
all of our lives feel bigger,
I think, and more important

718
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:21,929
because of the way
the actors play these things

719
00:30:21,930 --> 00:30:25,129
and the you invest
in this family.

720
00:30:25,130 --> 00:30:27,799
We have the type of fans
that are sort of quick

721
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,529
to share their personal stories

722
00:30:29,530 --> 00:30:33,099
and to tell you what particular
story line related to them

723
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:35,159
and moved them
and impacted their life.

724
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:38,699
My son is adopted, and he looks
different than my husband and I,

725
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:41,499
and it's just
It's so nice to have a show

726
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:44,999
to watch that adoption is
a huge part of the story line.

727
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,729
So, we like
watching this family.

728
00:30:48,730 --> 00:30:49,829
'Cause this is us.

729
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:51,499
I met a woman on the street.

730
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:55,129
She said, "Your show
and your story line

731
00:30:55,130 --> 00:30:57,859
made me realize that
there's something that I can do

732
00:30:57,860 --> 00:31:00,599
with my life that I need to do.

733
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:03,359
And so I adopted this baby
because of you."

734
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,359
And I was like...
That's the first time

735
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:08,199
anybody's ever told me
that before, right?

736
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:11,399
You're adopted, and we don't
talk about that enough,

737
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:14,130
'cause to me, you are
every part my son.

738
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:19,299
My mother adopted my youngest
brother and sister

739
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:21,699
who are now 20 and 18 years old,

740
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:25,259
so it was a story line that was
near and dear to my heart

741
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:31,059
because I've witnessed firsthand
how love can transform lives.

742
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:32,999
He wants to adopt a little boy
because he was a little boy

743
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,529
when he was adopted.
Yeah.

744
00:31:35,530 --> 00:31:36,699
I mean, I guess
that's part of it.

745
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:37,999
He wants to honor
his two fathers

746
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,959
by replicating the exact
same situation he had.

747
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,459
I don't know if I would put it

748
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:44,359
Hey, Mary, let me ask you
you have any kids laying around

749
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:46,099
that were left
at a fire station?

750
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:48,159
'Cause that might really scratch
my husband's itch.

751
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:51,629
I really dug when they said
that we were going to foster

752
00:31:51,630 --> 00:31:53,099
and it was gonna be
an older kid.

753
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:56,899
I just thought, "Wow, that's
so not neat and pretty

754
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:59,759
and tied up with a little bow,
and it's just perfect."

755
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:02,699
Randall, if we're
really gonna do this,

756
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:04,199
let's take in an older kid

757
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:07,529
who no one else in the whole
damn world is gonna help.

758
00:32:07,530 --> 00:32:09,529
All the writers
and, of course, Dan

759
00:32:09,530 --> 00:32:12,399
have been so diligent
about being authentic

760
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:15,259
in whatever any of
these characters plights are.

761
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:17,629
I think addiction in particular
is something

762
00:32:17,630 --> 00:32:19,359
of course a through line
through the Pearsons,

763
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:23,459
whether it's alcohol
with Jack or pills or food.

764
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:25,729
We're all trying to fill a void
with something.

765
00:32:25,730 --> 00:32:29,799
You don't know
everything about me.

766
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,099
Yes, I do.

767
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:32,729
I know everything about
No, Rebecca, you don't.

768
00:32:32,730 --> 00:32:35,030
I'm drunk right now.

769
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:40,329
I have been drunk all day.

770
00:32:40,330 --> 00:32:43,659
I have been drunk for weeks.

771
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:46,229
"This Is Us" is special to me
because of Jack Pearson.

772
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:48,429
While he does have his vices
we all do,

773
00:32:48,430 --> 00:32:51,459
in some capacity or another
but he takes

774
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:53,429
he takes those problems
and issues head on

775
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:56,559
and shows what it means
to be a man in those situations,

776
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:59,729
and I just hope to be
the kind of man Jack Pearson is.

777
00:32:59,730 --> 00:33:04,859
I think Rebecca is a fierce
supporter and partner

778
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:07,999
when it comes
to facing Jack's addiction.

779
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,659
I think she sees the thread
in both of her children.

780
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:14,329
We're a family of addicts.

781
00:33:14,330 --> 00:33:15,829
Okay.

782
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:17,599
We're not a family
of addicts, Kev.

783
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,659
Our father was an addict, Kate.

784
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:22,259
His father was an addict.
I'm an addict.

785
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:24,859
I think the addiction thing
just came from all the pain

786
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:26,729
and just keeping
everything inside

787
00:33:26,730 --> 00:33:29,599
and never talking about
his father's death.

788
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,999
Kevin Pearson will walk again

789
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,959
just in time to bury
his beloved father.

790
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:37,960
That'll keep him down
for good this time, right?

791
00:33:40,530 --> 00:33:45,659
When he's on the football field
and sort of recounting his life

792
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:47,999
and how people
perceive him versus

793
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,259
how he's actually experiencing
life in his own skin

794
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:55,959
I thought Justin laid that out.

795
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:57,629
And he tries so hard
to be strong,

796
00:33:57,630 --> 00:34:01,900
and he needs painkillers
to get through it.

797
00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:06,529
And even when he tries to tell
people how pathetic he is,

798
00:34:06,530 --> 00:34:09,529
they just...

799
00:34:09,530 --> 00:34:11,099
They don't hear it.

800
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:12,559
They just cheer.

801
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,829
When I saw Kevin,
I didn't see him as this guy

802
00:34:14,830 --> 00:34:16,629
that had the world on a string.

803
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:20,059
I saw him as a guy
in a crowded room

804
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:22,099
with everyone staring at him

805
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:24,099
and just being totally
and completely alone.

806
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:25,929
The first time I ever showed
the cast

807
00:34:25,930 --> 00:34:28,259
the television show,
we went over to our director,

808
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:31,759
Glenn Ficarra's, house
to screen them the pilot.

809
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,229
And I was like, "Chrissy, like,

810
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:35,059
I don't know what's going
to happen to the show,

811
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:37,359
but I know that people
are going to attach

812
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,959
to this character
and your performance."

813
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:41,729
I knew in an instant when I was
introduced to Kate Pearson

814
00:34:41,730 --> 00:34:43,659
that she was my character.

815
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:46,629
We both struggled with weight,
so watching her story line

816
00:34:46,630 --> 00:34:49,359
is like I'm watching
myself on TV.

817
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:52,960
It's always gonna be about
the weight for me, Toby.

818
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:59,100
It's been my story ever since
I was a little girl.

819
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,729
And every moment that I'm not
thinking about it,

820
00:35:03,730 --> 00:35:05,159
I'm thinking about it.

821
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:06,530
[ Sighs ]

822
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,329
Oh! I might get
a little teary.

823
00:35:10,330 --> 00:35:13,359
There was a woman who said that
"My son has an eating disorder,

824
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:16,729
and we're going to an eating
disorder clinic right now,

825
00:35:16,730 --> 00:35:19,899
but what you've done for him
and what you've done for

826
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:23,859
for kids and all sorts of people
to really accept yourself

827
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:25,659
for who you are to get
to the place you want to be

828
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:27,329
is just incredible."

829
00:35:27,330 --> 00:35:29,559
And that was like...

830
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,999
'Cause that's all we all want,
is, like,

831
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,659
to be able to be ourselves
but be loved for that.

832
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:37,899
The reason why "This Is Us"
is so special to me

833
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:40,359
is because I lost my father.

834
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:43,799
I relate to Kate's character
because I stayed the night

835
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:46,759
with my parents the night
before he passed away,

836
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:49,729
and if I hadn't had been there,
if me and my boyfriend

837
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:52,299
now husband at the time
had not been fighting,

838
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:54,759
I wouldn't have parked
behind his truck,

839
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:56,659
um, he wouldn't have taken
his motorcycle,

840
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:58,429
and he would still be here.

841
00:35:58,430 --> 00:36:00,159
So I blame myself

842
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,699
You remember when I told you

843
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:04,359
I couldn't talk about
my dad's death.

844
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:06,000
Yeah, of course.

845
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:12,129
Well, that's because
it's my fault.

846
00:36:12,130 --> 00:36:13,800
Mmhmm.

847
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:17,099
I'm the reason that he's dead.

848
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:21,099
If this show is making you cry,
then maybe maybe it's

849
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:22,829
maybe that you need
to call somebody

850
00:36:22,830 --> 00:36:25,459
or maybe you need
to apologize to somebody,

851
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:27,629
or maybe you need to talk
to your mom more,

852
00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:29,999
or maybe you need
to forgive your brother.

853
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,299
I was not a very good brother
to you, was I?

854
