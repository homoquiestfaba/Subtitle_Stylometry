What's here?

325
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,480
A book about the family

326
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:11,640
Women dream of betraying the man who

And the school also

330
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:22,240

00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:49,800
He died in his sleep

382
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:52,280

392
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:47,320
I think that the man is connected to this school

393
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:49,480
I do not know

394
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:54,920

I said

407
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:05,480
I said we did not know each other

408
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:09,760
But all of us in this school
And this image together

Why did you lie to? -
But he did not lie -

412

Stop lying -
I did not lie -

414
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:26,520
I did not want that the Chair continue with your life
These memories

415
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:30,000
I did not want to remember
I wanted you to oblivion

416
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:31,800
Say what?

417
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:38,320
What happened to this school?

418
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:46,560
There was a man

419
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:49,000
Primary school

420
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:52,120
(Name (Fred McGregor

421
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:01,840
It was Alhaddaiki

422
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:05,960
I have lived in the basement of the school

423
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:08,640
You and you children as his life

424
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:22,280
We did not want the ratification of this first

425
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:24,560
Ready or not?

426
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:27,000
You have all innocent

427
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,400
(And you (Nancy

428
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:33,760

429
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:35,480

00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:37,680
And you'll be a favorite for him

431
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:42,480
...........

432
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:45,040
Then we began to notice several things

433
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:54,200
Yes, it is strange recently

434
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:59,040
We have taken the secret to the cave

435
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,160
There is nothing wrong

436
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:05,720
Why did not you contact the police then?

437
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:09,520
He has left the city before we can
Be confronted

438
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:12,520
He has gone, can not anymore Ovetk

439
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:15,840
If your dreams that, Sandra

440
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:19,160
Are just memories

441
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:23,120
Of a very difficult time

442
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:26,880
I wish you to be right

443
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:32,120
We must find the rest of the children of the picture

00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:37,800
Can not be the full story
Probably no more

446
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:41,320
I have heard what she said "Your mother, it's just
Bad memories

447
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:45,240
I do not care, you may be mistaken -
It does not matter is the memory only -

448
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:46,440
How do you know this?

449
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:48,280
Memories do not kill you

450
00:52:57,160 --> 00:52:59,200
Come, enter the car

451
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:00,640

"Nightmares again, a man burnt face"

491
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:12,600
I have another nightmare last night I heard

492
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:18,680
Burnt face man trying to kill me

493
00:59:18,840 --> 00:59:22,320
I realized this time that the incident
Got middle school

494
00:59:22,560 --> 00:59:25,680
I woke up before finding out anything
But mostly this means something

495
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:31,360
He does Btaatbai to school this time

496
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:33,800
And had fled to the basement

497
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:35,960
What apparently is willing to go
To that place

498
00:59:37,160 --> 00:59:38,880
If he wants me to find something

499
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:43,800
I started the dream and my eyes wide open

500
00:59:44,040 --> 00:59:45,760

The grown the dream

503
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:55,280
If you make this dream mean that I was going to die

504
00:59:57,320 --> 01:00:00,040
Is there any one place with him the same thing?

505
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,720
Can anyone help me?
