737
00:59:23,127 --> 00:59:24,927
Make the call.

738
00:59:24,929 --> 00:59:27,029
put your foot down. Oooh.

739
00:59:27,031 --> 00:59:27,195
-My van, my road trip, my rules.

740
00:59:31,634 --> 00:59:32,868
-Could someone get their twist
in a joint,

741
00:59:32,870 --> 00:59:35,871
and turn up the music please?

742
00:59:35,873 --> 00:59:37,873
-Hey what do you want to listen
to, Jerry?

743
00:59:37,875 --> 00:59:39,074
No Doobie Brothers.

744
00:59:39,076 --> 00:59:40,709
-We can't listen to music

745
00:59:40,711 --> 00:59:42,177
we'll miss the hot spots, right
guys?

746
00:59:42,179 --> 00:59:45,213
(LAUGHING)

747
00:59:50,019 --> 00:59:53,121
-Could we at least put some
tunes on?

748
00:59:53,123 --> 00:59:54,222
-There's no power.

749
00:59:54,224 --> 00:59:56,725
-Oh God.

750
00:59:56,727 --> 00:59:59,094
-Hey Jerry, tell us a story?

751
00:59:59,096 --> 01:00:01,096
You're always so funny.

752
01:00:01,098 --> 01:00:04,866
-Oh. Oh no, Jerry is not very
entertaining.

753
01:00:04,868 --> 01:00:06,034
-Hey, I resent that.

754
01:00:06,036 --> 01:00:08,904
-I think that you are very
entertaining

755
01:00:08,906 --> 01:00:12,040
-No, no please don't give him a
hand job

756
01:00:12,042 --> 01:00:13,942
in this car. We don't want to
see that.

757
01:00:13,944 --> 01:00:16,678
-Guys I think someone is coming.

758
01:00:16,680 --> 01:00:18,080
-No shit.

759
01:00:18,082 --> 01:00:23,118
-Not in here out there.

760
01:00:39,202 --> 01:00:40,869
MOTORIST:
Hey, pretty thing.

761
01:00:40,871 --> 01:00:42,070
What seems to be the problem?

762
01:00:42,072 --> 01:00:45,073
-We're stuck can you help us?

763
01:00:45,075 --> 01:00:46,708
-Yeah I'll take a look.

764
01:00:46,710 --> 01:00:48,076
-Lost a spark plug wire.

765
01:00:48,078 --> 01:00:51,680
-Well shit fire and save
matches, boy.

766
01:00:51,682 --> 01:00:54,082
How long have you been driving?

767
01:00:54,084 --> 01:00:57,352
-All night at least five hours.
-Five hours, yeah.

768
01:00:57,354 --> 01:00:59,788
-Deader then a door nail.

769
01:00:59,790 --> 01:01:01,189
-Really?

770
01:01:01,191 --> 01:01:04,192
I ain't got that part in my
shop.

771
01:01:04,194 --> 01:01:07,095
You'll have to wait till
morning.

772
01:01:07,097 --> 01:01:08,730
(SPITS)

773
01:01:08,732 --> 01:01:10,098
-Is there a motel nearby

774
01:01:10,100 --> 01:01:12,968
or somewhere you can take us?
-Yeah?

775
01:01:12,970 --> 01:01:16,238
-Nearest motel is about 100
miles back that way.

776
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:18,974
-Oh. That's where we just came
from.

777
01:01:18,976 --> 01:01:20,876
-He's not that creepy.

778
01:01:20,878 --> 01:01:23,111
-No, he's...

779
01:01:23,113 --> 01:01:24,379
he's creepy.

780
01:01:24,381 --> 01:01:27,082
Are you desperate enough I guess

781
01:01:27,084 --> 01:01:28,984
I can let you all stay at my
place.

782
01:01:28,986 --> 01:01:31,353
-Really you'd do that?

783
01:01:31,355 --> 01:01:34,756
-Sure, fix it in the morning.

784
01:01:34,758 --> 01:01:36,391
It would take me

785
01:01:36,393 --> 01:01:37,259
fifteen minutes to put the part
on.

786
01:01:37,261 --> 01:01:39,828
Take no time at all.

787
01:01:39,830 --> 01:01:42,130
-We don't want to be any
imposition.

788
01:01:42,132 --> 01:01:44,232
-Ain't no trouble. Just gotta
give you

789
01:01:44,234 --> 01:01:45,901
a heads up though,

790
01:01:45,903 --> 01:01:47,269
my family's a might bit
eccentric

791
01:01:47,271 --> 01:01:48,970
if that don't bother you.

792
01:01:48,972 --> 01:01:52,774
Different strokes for different
folks, right?

793
01:01:52,776 --> 01:01:56,111
We just don't want to sleep in
the van again.

794
01:01:56,113 --> 01:01:58,013
-Why don't you hop in the truck
there, boy.

795
01:01:58,015 --> 01:01:59,247
And you, pretty little thing,
hop in the van

796
01:01:59,249 --> 01:02:00,882
-Appreciate it.

797
01:02:00,884 --> 01:02:04,786
-Who would stop in the middle of
the night?

798
01:02:04,788 --> 01:02:06,888
-He is going to let us stay at
his house.

799
01:02:06,890 --> 01:02:09,091
Perfect strangers.

800
01:02:09,093 --> 01:02:11,159
-That's kind of weird.

801
01:02:11,161 --> 01:02:16,164
-Bad idea to talk to strangers.

802
01:02:16,899 --> 01:02:19,067
-Now you all remember now,

803
01:02:19,069 --> 01:02:20,836
like I said about my family,

804
01:02:20,838 --> 01:02:24,005
ain't quite typical...

805
01:02:24,007 --> 01:02:26,808
especially you big city folk,

806
01:02:26,810 --> 01:02:27,876
you're big city folk right?

807
01:02:27,878 --> 01:02:28,477
-Yeah.

808
01:02:28,479 --> 01:02:29,311
Brother!

809
01:02:29,313 --> 01:02:29,978
-Hey!

810
01:02:29,980 --> 01:02:31,213
-Sweetheart!

811
01:02:31,215 --> 01:02:33,915
Good to see ya.

812
01:02:33,917 --> 01:02:38,353
This here is my baby sister
Ruth.

813
01:02:38,355 --> 01:02:39,921
-Candy. Everybody calls me
Candy.

814
01:02:39,923 --> 01:02:41,823
-Incest... check.

815
01:02:41,825 --> 01:02:44,359
-Gosh, Ruth is kind of an old
sounding name

816
01:02:44,361 --> 01:02:44,960
don't you think?

817
01:02:44,962 --> 01:02:45,961
-Yeah.

818
01:02:45,963 --> 01:02:47,362
-Hi. June.

819
01:02:47,364 --> 01:02:49,397
-Jay.

820
01:02:49,399 --> 01:02:52,868
-So why do they call you Candy?

821
01:02:52,870 --> 01:02:54,836
-Because I am the sweetest thing

822
01:02:54,838 --> 01:02:56,905
in this entire county.

823
01:02:59,509 --> 01:03:01,209
-I bet you are.

824
01:03:01,211 --> 01:03:05,046
(LAUGHING)

825
01:03:05,048 --> 01:03:10,051
-Hi. I am Nancy and I am not
amused.

826
01:03:25,401 --> 01:03:30,906
-Hey.

827
01:03:32,208 --> 01:03:37,312
Hey.

828
01:03:37,914 --> 01:03:39,247
MOTORIST:

829
01:03:39,249 --> 01:03:40,148
-Oh.

830
01:03:40,150 --> 01:03:41,116
(LAUGHS)

831
01:03:41,118 --> 01:03:42,350
-This here is Ron.

832
01:03:42,352 --> 01:03:43,351
He and his friends,

833
01:03:43,353 --> 01:03:44,519
they got stuck in route 33.

834
01:03:44,521 --> 01:03:46,021
They going be staying the night,

835
01:03:46,023 --> 01:03:47,155
if that's okay.

836
01:03:47,157 --> 01:03:49,124
-Oh, well how do you do?

837
01:03:49,126 --> 01:03:50,492
-Good to meet you Ma'am.

838
01:03:50,494 --> 01:03:52,227
-How many friends did you say?

839
01:03:52,229 --> 01:03:54,429
-Ah, they'll be six of them.

840
01:03:54,431 --> 01:03:55,497
-Six!

841
01:03:55,499 --> 01:03:58,533
some real good party.

842
01:03:58,535 --> 01:03:59,501
-Yeah!

843
01:03:59,503 --> 01:04:01,436
-It's my brother's 45th.

844
01:04:01,438 --> 01:04:04,005
-Now, I know you can't believe

845
01:04:04,007 --> 01:04:06,274
that I would have a son that
old, can you?

846
01:04:06,276 --> 01:04:09,277
-I never would've guessed ma'am.

847
01:04:09,279 --> 01:04:10,412
You look great.

848
01:04:10,414 --> 01:04:13,148
-Oh well now, aren't you just
most charming

849
01:04:13,150 --> 01:04:16,017
little devil, you.

850
01:04:16,019 --> 01:04:17,252
-Will you stop that!

851
01:04:17,254 --> 01:04:18,353
-Shit fire, Mama!

852
01:04:18,355 --> 01:04:21,156
-I'd told you not to get in my
cooking.

853
01:04:21,158 --> 01:04:22,023
-Yes ma'am.

854
01:04:22,025 --> 01:04:23,124
We are gonna have

855
01:04:23,126 --> 01:04:23,592
some real good party tonight.

856
01:04:23,594 --> 01:04:26,528
-Ah, you do like cake don't you?

857
01:04:26,530 --> 01:04:29,197
-I love cake.

858
01:04:29,199 --> 01:04:31,233

nice meeting you, I'll be right

-Thank you.

863
01:05:04,533 --> 01:05:08,203
One set of lovers campus beds.

864
01:05:08,205 --> 01:05:13,208
These beds are really sturdy.

865
01:05:15,077 --> 01:05:19,114
See, Cody is really good with
his tools.

866
01:05:19,116 --> 01:05:21,182
-Ron and I will take this room.

867
01:05:21,184 --> 01:05:23,318
-Great. Okay so there's two more
rooms

868
01:05:23,320 --> 01:05:26,354
down the hall, so just make
yourselves at home.

869
01:05:26,356 --> 01:05:28,323
I gotta go get ready for the
show.

870
01:05:28,325 --> 01:05:31,426
-Show?

871
01:05:31,428 --> 01:05:36,298
-You'll see.

872
01:05:36,300 --> 01:05:37,532
-Give that bitch a show.

873
01:05:37,534 --> 01:05:40,302
-Babe, mellow...

874
01:05:40,304 --> 01:05:42,971
(PHONE RINGS)

875
01:05:42,973 --> 01:05:44,039
Hello?

876
01:05:44,041 --> 01:05:47,142
Oh hi, honey, what?

877
01:05:47,144 --> 01:05:51,146
That's great news, I'll see you
then.

878
01:05:51,148 --> 01:05:55,116
That was Papa, so we can start
the show.

879
01:05:55,118 --> 01:05:57,152
He said he'd be home in time for
dinner.

880
01:05:57,154 --> 01:05:58,420
Cody!

881
01:05:58,422 --> 01:06:01,156
Are you drinking a Pepsi?

882
01:06:01,158 --> 01:06:03,091
Have you offer these folks a
Pepsi

883
01:06:03,093 --> 01:06:04,259
or a beer?

884
01:06:04,261 --> 01:06:05,193
Where are your manners?

885
01:06:05,195 --> 01:06:07,629
When are you gonna learn to be
hospitable?

886
01:06:07,631 --> 01:06:09,064
-I'm sorry Mama.

887
01:06:09,732 --> 01:06:10,598

You want Pepsi?

891
01:06:25,247 --> 01:06:26,581
FAMILY:
Hey. Yay!

892
01:06:26,583 --> 01:06:30,385

01:06:30,387 --> 01:06:31,086
CANDY:
Okay guys

894
01:06:31,088 --> 01:06:32,587
just don't make fun of my
outfit.

895
01:06:32,589 --> 01:06:34,356
I grew a bit since I graduated.

896
01:06:34,358 --> 01:06:36,491
(LAUGHTER)

897
01:06:36,493 --> 01:06:39,160
-Do you want to tell her that
her outfit

898
01:06:39,162 --> 01:06:43,531
isn't a problem or shall I?

899
01:06:43,666 --> 01:06:48,136
-Brady loves my cheers.

900
01:06:48,138 --> 01:06:52,640
-Ruthie and Cody, Candy and all
of them.

901
01:06:52,642 --> 01:06:57,645

-Yay!

906
01:07:12,295 --> 01:07:15,697
-I don't have a good feeling
about this.

907
01:07:15,699 --> 01:07:19,134
-Nah this is cool.

908
01:07:19,136 --> 01:07:21,403

909
01:07:21,405 --> 01:07:23,571
CANDY:

You know that tow truck out
there?

1100
01:18:55,098 --> 01:18:57,898
It spits shit out into the air.

1101
01:18:57,900 --> 01:19:00,234
And that pollution is causing
the planet to cool.

1102
01:19:00,236 --> 01:19:02,036
Yeah that's right fucko.

1103
01:19:02,038 --> 01:19:03,370

disappointed, I...

perform better.

You got some crabs?

Billy Jack was a butcher.

being in the middle

that,

1288

having to keep that secret.

-How do you mean?

1290
01:32:06,154 --> 01:32:08,054
-Well, Rusty got a little messed
up

1291
01:32:08,056 --> 01:32:11,691
in Johnson's war over there.

1292
01:32:11,693 --> 01:32:15,595
Brutally disfigured, face all
burnt up.

1293
01:32:15,597 --> 01:32:16,663
He didn't want to come back

1294
01:32:16,665 --> 01:32:17,964
to the family looking like that.

1295
01:32:17,966 --> 01:32:22,636
He wasn't ready for normal
society.

1296
01:32:22,638 --> 01:32:27,107
So we just decided to tell them
he's dead.

1297
01:32:27,109 --> 01:32:29,910
And I told him he could come
here and live with me

1298
01:32:29,912 --> 01:32:34,915
and I would help him out with
his issues.

They turn our boys in to killing
machines.

1301
01:32:53,735 --> 01:32:56,836
It's hard to let go.

1302
01:32:56,838 --> 01:32:58,271
Hey, maybe someday

1303
01:32:58,273 --> 01:33:01,875
Rusty will just want to stop
killing.

1304
01:33:01,877 --> 01:33:06,012
Could maybe even turn back to be
normal.
