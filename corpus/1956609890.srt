Without a laptop.

353
00:21:44,085 --> 00:21:46,522
I sit in coffee shops

- No, of course, I haven't.

00:22:16,422 --> 00:22:20,121
But I'm still trying.

364
00:22:20,164 --> 00:22:24,081
- Well, it takes time.
You're very young.

365
00:22:24,125 --> 00:22:27,084

for the past 26 years.

366
00:22:27,128 --> 00:22:32,568
- Twenty-six?
My grandson is 26.

367
00:22:32,612 --> 00:22:37,747
- Oh.

368
00:22:37,791 --> 00:22:39,488
- Oh, goodness me.
Look at the time.

369
00:22:39,532 --> 00:22:41,403
I'm going to be
late for dinner.

- Oh, well, I'll whistle
up a cab for you.

00:22:49,498 --> 00:22:51,370

- I would be delighted
if you would come

377
00:23:25,665 --> 00:23:27,884
and have dinner
with me one evening.

378
00:23:27,928 --> 00:23:29,799
- At the Claremont?

379
00:23:29,843 --> 00:23:32,585
- I'd like to repay
your kindness in some way.

380
00:23:32,628 --> 00:23:35,283
- Why, that would be
very grand.

381
00:23:35,326 --> 00:23:38,460
- Would Saturday suit you?

382
00:23:38,504 --> 00:23:40,201

have a little adventure.

- Nevertheless, it was
very kind of you.

- Oh, how lovely!

395

Is he married?
Does he have a girlfriend?

I have a young visitor
for dinner on Saturday,

424
00:26:02,996 --> 00:26:06,390
and everybody assumed it
was my grandson, Desmond.

425
00:26:06,434 --> 00:26:08,567
- So?

426
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:11,178
- Well, I didn't deny it.

427
00:26:11,221 --> 00:26:14,442
I just let it go.
It was such a surprise.

428

You see, he never
came to visit.

429
00:26:16,139 --> 00:26:18,315
He didn't even call.

430
00:26:18,359 --> 00:26:21,710
So they all refer to him
as my "mythical" grandson.

- Well, I don't
see the problem.

Why don't I be your
grandson for the evening?

- Well, of course.

I take him everywhere.
And you?

- I like him,
but William Blake's my man.

favorite poet.

You see, it runs in the family.

522
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:38,679
- Thank you.

523
00:31:38,722 --> 00:31:40,855
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

524
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:43,205

525
00:31:43,249 --> 00:31:45,077
How do you do?

526
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,296
- Fine, thank you.

527
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:49,342
- [Giggling]

528
00:32:00,005 --> 00:32:02,137
- Bye-bye.

529
00:32:07,490 --> 00:32:10,493
- You know, I'm enjoying
this too much.

530
00:32:10,537 --> 00:32:12,495
Do you think
that's wicked?

531
00:32:12,539 --> 00:32:15,107
- No. Enjoy it
as much as you can.

532
00:32:15,150 --> 00:32:17,239
I've never enjoyed
myself more...

534
00:32:38,521 --> 00:32:40,132

535
00:32:46,486 --> 00:32:49,010
May I be brutally frank?

536
00:32:49,054 --> 00:32:52,144
- Oh, dear. I don't know.

537
00:32:52,187 --> 00:32:55,321
- What are you doing here?

538
00:32:55,364 --> 00:32:57,323
You don't seem to belong.

539
00:32:57,366 --> 00:33:00,369
- Well, that's a long story.

540
00:33:00,413 --> 00:33:03,720
I must confess, I feel
quite comfortable here.

541
00:33:03,764 --> 00:33:06,158
And safe.

542
00:33:06,201 --> 00:33:09,857
According to Mrs. Arbuthnot,
you're not allowed to die here.

543
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:15,602
- [Laughing] Well, that may be
wishful thinking on her part.

544
00:33:15,645 --> 00:33:18,518
I don't know. I imagined you
traveling the world,

545
00:33:18,561 --> 00:33:21,173
visiting exotic places.

546
00:33:21,216 --> 00:33:25,090
- Oh, I did that.
In the past, with Arthur.

547
00:33:25,133 --> 00:33:28,136
- Grandpapa.

548
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:31,009
- He would've
liked you very much.

549
00:33:31,052 --> 00:33:34,012
And vice-versa.

550
00:33:34,055 --> 00:33:36,753
- I'm so, so sorry
to interrupt.

551
00:33:36,797 --> 00:33:39,495
- Uh, Mrs. Burton.

552
00:33:39,539 --> 00:33:42,759
- I'm just off to the theater
with some friends

553
00:33:42,803 --> 00:33:44,544
and I didn't want to miss
the grand opportunity

554
00:33:44,587 --> 00:33:47,460
of meeting your grandson.

555
00:33:47,503 --> 00:33:50,811
Hello, darling.
Shirley. Shirley Burton.

556
00:33:50,854 --> 00:33:52,900
- Desmond.
How do you do?

557
00:33:52,943 --> 00:33:57,209
- I see that good looks
and charm runs in the family.

558
00:33:57,252 --> 00:33:59,559
- That's very kind of you.

559
00:33:59,602 --> 00:34:02,866
- You have good genes,
Mrs. Palfrey.

560
00:34:10,091 --> 00:34:13,051
- Isn't it remarkable how people
see what they want to see.

561
00:34:17,577 --> 00:34:19,535
- Yes. Remarkable.

562
00:34:29,458 --> 00:34:31,417
You don't have to
see me out.

563
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:33,593
- I don't have to,
but I want to.

564
00:34:33,636 --> 00:34:37,118
I don't know
how to thank you.

565
00:34:37,162 --> 00:34:42,080
You have no idea how much
this has meant to me.

566
00:34:42,123 --> 00:34:43,951
- Well, it's reciprocal.

567
00:34:43,994 --> 00:34:46,345
You've given me
ideas, Mrs. Palfrey.

568
00:34:46,388 --> 00:34:48,042
- Oh?

569
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:51,828
- A story is shaping up
in my mind,

570
00:34:51,872 --> 00:34:53,743
something you could
help me with.

571
00:34:53,787 --> 00:34:56,616
- Oh, tell me.

572
00:34:56,659 --> 00:34:58,879
- Would you share with me

573
00:34:58,922 --> 00:35:02,709
some of the things that matter
to you from your life.

574
00:35:02,752 --> 00:35:05,538
And in return, I can
show you some from mine.

575
00:35:05,581 --> 00:35:07,888
- Most of the things
that mattered to me

576
00:35:07,931 --> 00:35:10,586
are not around anymore.

577
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:14,068
I live in here...

578
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:16,114
and here.

579
00:35:16,157 --> 00:35:18,638
- That's exactly what I mean.

580
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:38,484
- Mrs. Palfrey!

581
00:35:39,963 --> 00:35:41,661
He's divine!

582
00:35:41,704 --> 00:35:44,446
I can't wait for him
to meet my niece.

583
00:35:44,490 --> 00:35:46,840
Something tells me,
Mrs. Palfrey,

584
00:35:46,883 --> 00:35:49,538
that we'll end up
being relatives.

585
00:35:49,582 --> 00:35:53,760
- Mrs. Post, please don't
frighten the poor woman.

586
00:35:53,803 --> 00:35:55,762
- [Laughing]

587
00:35:55,805 --> 00:35:58,068
- Mrs. Palfrey, hello.

588
00:35:58,112 --> 00:36:00,114
Although we haven't
officially met,

589
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:02,769
I'm Lorna De Salis,
and this is my son, Willie.

590
00:36:02,812 --> 00:36:04,162
- Oh, how do you do?

591
00:36:04,205 --> 00:36:06,164
- We're staying at
the Claremont for a brief period

592
00:36:06,207 --> 00:36:09,689
until the renovations of our
apartment are complete.

593
00:36:09,732 --> 00:36:11,821
We're theater people.

594
00:36:11,865 --> 00:36:15,825
Oh, we come from generations
of theater people.

595
00:36:15,869 --> 00:36:19,655
And although I have recently
retired from the stage,

596
00:36:19,699 --> 00:36:23,050
Willie runs an amateur dramatic
group for young actors

597
00:36:23,093 --> 00:36:25,966
whom he believes to
hold great promise.

598
00:36:26,009 --> 00:36:29,578
And sometimes I help out.
[Laughing]

599
00:36:29,622 --> 00:36:31,537
Do you think your grandson
might be interested

600
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:33,278
in joining our little group?

601
00:36:33,321 --> 00:36:35,976
I mean, Willie thinks
he has the makings

602
00:36:36,019 --> 00:36:38,239
of a splendid leading man.

603
00:36:38,283 --> 00:36:40,894
Don't you, dear?
- Oh, Indeed I do, Mother.

604
00:36:40,937 --> 00:36:44,027
- Uh, well, I don't know.

605
00:36:44,071 --> 00:36:45,899
I mean, he's a write--

606
00:36:45,942 --> 00:36:49,685
He's very busy
at the Archives.

607
00:36:49,729 --> 00:36:51,905
- "Archives"?

608
00:36:51,948 --> 00:36:53,907
- Yes, at the British Museum.

609
00:36:53,950 --> 00:36:56,126
- But a face like that

610
00:36:56,170 --> 00:36:58,259
can't be locked away
in the Archives.

611
00:36:58,303 --> 00:37:01,262
It should be seen--
on the stage,

612
00:37:01,306 --> 00:37:04,134
on the box,
on the screen.

613
00:37:04,178 --> 00:37:07,268
- Willie, dear,
now, calm yourself.

614
00:37:07,312 --> 00:37:09,009
Remember your
blood pressure.

615
00:37:09,052 --> 00:37:10,445

616
00:37:10,489 --> 00:37:13,013
He can be rather
exuberant at times,

617
00:37:13,056 --> 00:37:15,885
but it's what makes him
such a brilliant actor.

618
00:37:15,929 --> 00:37:19,280
Now, do let us know
what your grandson thinks.

619
00:37:19,324 --> 00:37:21,413
- I shall.
- Good night.

620
00:37:21,456 --> 00:37:23,284

Well, thank you, Mr. Osborne.

should go to my daughter.
