1
00:01:40,415 --> 00:01:42,724
Okay, let's see who we got here.

2
00:01:44,055 --> 00:01:46,967
Virge Hoogesteger.
What kind of name is that?

3
00:01:47,055 --> 00:01:50,445
Youngest of six.
Worked in the family diner before joining.

4
00:01:50,535 --> 00:01:53,891
Writes home every week.
Nicknamed ''The Virgin. ''

5
00:01:57,055 --> 00:01:58,727
Who's this goon?

6
00:01:58,855 --> 00:02:01,210
Jack Bocci from Chicago.

7
00:02:01,375 --> 00:02:03,809
Graduate of several reform schools.

8
00:02:03,895 --> 00:02:06,329
Better keep him in the background.

9
00:02:08,855 --> 00:02:12,211
This is the religious one.
There's always a religious one.

10
00:02:12,335 --> 00:02:16,089
Eugene McVey from Cleveland.
There's always one from Cleveland.

11
00:02:16,175 --> 00:02:19,850
Nineteen, high-strung,
always coming down with something.

12
00:02:20,095 --> 00:02:22,165
How'd he get in this bunch?

13
00:02:24,135 --> 00:02:28,572
Richard ''Rascal'' Moore.
Eighteen, 5' 4'', 120 pounds.

14
00:02:28,655 --> 00:02:31,169
Has a real reputation as a ladies' man.

15
00:02:31,295 --> 00:02:33,525
At least, that's what he says.

16
00:02:34,855 --> 00:02:37,415
Clay Busby, a farmer's son.

17
00:02:37,895 --> 00:02:40,170
When his father lost their farm
in a poker game...

18
00:02:40,255 --> 00:02:43,247
...Clay started playing piano
in a New Orleans cathouse.

19
00:02:43,535 --> 00:02:45,491
The papers'll love that.

20
00:02:46,815 --> 00:02:50,490
This kid couldn't be more Irish if he tried,
Danny Daly.

21
00:02:50,615 --> 00:02:53,493
A student, editor of the school paper,
valedictorian.

22
00:02:53,575 --> 00:02:57,284
He volunteered the day
after he graduated from college.

23
00:02:58,175 --> 00:03:01,850
That's not bad. I think we got something
to work with here.

24
00:03:09,855 --> 00:03:11,527
They're coming in!

25
00:03:21,855 --> 00:03:25,131
-That's 15, 16!
-There's another one!

26
00:03:32,495 --> 00:03:34,451
At this point, 15 or 16.

27
00:03:35,495 --> 00:03:38,487
They're still coming in.
How can I promise 24 planes tomorrow?

28
00:03:38,575 --> 00:03:41,043
I don't know if they'll all make it back.

29
00:03:41,575 --> 00:03:42,724
Where?

30
00:03:44,095 --> 00:03:46,893
I thought we hit that target a month ago.

31
00:03:47,335 --> 00:03:52,125
I know we have to keep the pressure on,
but I lost almost a quarter of my squadron.

32
00:03:54,895 --> 00:03:56,408
Yes, sir.

33
00:03:56,535 --> 00:03:59,049
I'll have the ground crews work
through the night.

34
00:03:59,135 --> 00:04:03,686
I'd hoped to give the boys a break.
We're having a dance tonight in honor--

35
00:04:06,935 --> 00:04:08,288
Yes, sir.

36
00:04:09,095 --> 00:04:11,563
I will update you when I know more.

37
00:04:12,095 --> 00:04:14,086
Thank you, sir. Good-bye.

38
00:04:15,055 --> 00:04:17,694
Sir, eighteen planes, three still out.

39
00:04:31,575 --> 00:04:33,770
So, that's the crew of the Memphis Belle?

40
00:04:33,855 --> 00:04:36,972
The enlisted men.
You'll meet the officers this afternoon.

41
00:04:37,375 --> 00:04:40,731
They must be the 10 luckiest
sons of bitches in the world.

42
00:04:40,815 --> 00:04:44,012
-They're just ordinary men.
-Are you kidding?

43
00:04:47,175 --> 00:04:49,928
Ordinary? First they volunteer for all this.

44
00:04:50,015 --> 00:04:54,531
Then they fly 24 missions without
a scratch. Doesn't sound ordinary to me.

45
00:04:54,855 --> 00:04:56,334
Two more, sir.

46
00:05:04,575 --> 00:05:08,045
People back home are getting discouraged
by our losses.

47
00:05:08,175 --> 00:05:11,008
They're thinking daylight bombing
is a mistake.

48
00:05:11,135 --> 00:05:14,650
-It's the only way we'll win this war.
-We must get that message across.

49
00:05:14,735 --> 00:05:16,168
That's where I come in.

50
00:05:16,255 --> 00:05:18,644
The nation will fall in love with those boys.

51
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:22,569
The first crew in the Eighth Air Force
to complete their tour of duty.

52
00:05:22,735 --> 00:05:24,453
-They haven't done it yet.
-They will.

53
00:05:24,535 --> 00:05:26,844
You'll make sure of that, right?

54
00:05:34,015 --> 00:05:34,925
One more.

55
00:05:35,215 --> 00:05:36,614
Just one more.

56
00:05:36,695 --> 00:05:39,812
It'd be great if everyone came back today,
with the dance and all.

57
00:05:40,015 --> 00:05:41,733
I give them four to one.

58
00:05:42,455 --> 00:05:43,808
Any takers?

59
00:05:44,415 --> 00:05:45,894
I'll have some of that.

60
00:05:45,975 --> 00:05:48,614
-Show me your money.
-Genie, loan me some money.

61
00:05:48,695 --> 00:05:51,084
-Do I look like Wells Fargo?
-You look like a weenie.

62
00:05:51,175 --> 00:05:52,494
There it is!

63
00:05:55,335 --> 00:05:57,451
I heard there's a swell band for the dance.

64
00:05:57,535 --> 00:05:59,890
Clay, maybe they'll let you croon a tune.

65
00:05:59,975 --> 00:06:01,567
You sing in the plane all the time.

66
00:06:01,655 --> 00:06:03,691
Yeah, but you guys got no taste.

67
00:06:44,935 --> 00:06:46,050
Come on, hurry up!

68
00:06:46,335 --> 00:06:47,654
Let's get out of here!

69
00:07:12,175 --> 00:07:14,973
So, you named the plane
after your girl back home? Right?

70
00:07:15,335 --> 00:07:16,734
It's a great angle.

71
00:07:16,815 --> 00:07:19,170
You don't sound
like you're from the South, Captain.

72
00:07:19,255 --> 00:07:21,291
I met her when I was in Memphis
on business.

73
00:07:21,375 --> 00:07:24,014
I bet she's a living doll, eh, Dennis?

74
00:07:24,295 --> 00:07:26,047
She's a fine woman, sir.

75
00:07:29,015 --> 00:07:32,530
A lifeguard?
That's a pretty responsible job, Luke.

76
00:07:32,655 --> 00:07:36,443
It's rough basking in the sun all day,
having girls swarm all over you.

77
00:07:36,535 --> 00:07:39,174
I joined up to get away from all that.

78
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:42,170
That's good!

79
00:07:42,535 --> 00:07:44,890
Val. What is that short for?

80
00:07:45,015 --> 00:07:46,334
Valentine!

81
00:07:47,575 --> 00:07:49,293
I bet women love that.

82
00:07:49,375 --> 00:07:52,287
Now, you're the bombardier, and...

83
00:07:52,455 --> 00:07:55,049
...I understand you've had four years
of medical school.

84
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:58,093
-Well--
-When your picture is in Life magazine...

85
00:07:58,175 --> 00:08:02,009
...every man and woman in America
will want you to be their doctor.

86
00:08:03,695 --> 00:08:05,686
Look at the camera, Phil.

87
00:08:06,855 --> 00:08:08,447
Sit up straight.

88
00:08:10,415 --> 00:08:11,564
Smile.

89
00:08:12,055 --> 00:08:13,886
What is there to smile about?

90
00:08:13,975 --> 00:08:18,127
One more mission and you get to go home.
That'd make me smile.

91
00:08:18,855 --> 00:08:20,607
Well, you're not me.

92
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:22,930
Please just take the picture.

93
00:08:24,335 --> 00:08:25,927
-Is that all, sir?
-Not quite.

94
00:08:26,735 --> 00:08:28,453
You'll go back home in the Belle.

95
00:08:28,535 --> 00:08:33,006
Fly all over the US, making speeches,
getting people to buy more war bonds...

96
00:08:33,135 --> 00:08:35,933
...work longer hours, put out more planes.

97
00:08:36,055 --> 00:08:39,525
And, believe me,
you'll be wined, womened, and songed...

98
00:08:39,615 --> 00:08:42,004
...from one end of the States to the other.

99
00:08:42,135 --> 00:08:45,730
It'll be tough,
but we all have to make sacrifices.

100
00:08:45,855 --> 00:08:47,083
We'll be famous?

101
00:08:47,175 --> 00:08:48,767
Afraid so, Luke.

102
00:08:50,855 --> 00:08:52,334
Colonel Derringer?

103
00:08:52,455 --> 00:08:54,650
I'm Army PR. Call me Bruce.

104
00:08:56,095 --> 00:08:57,926
We'll follow your orders--

105
00:08:58,015 --> 00:09:01,371
These are not orders.
We're working together on this.

106
00:09:01,855 --> 00:09:05,404
Fine. But I don't want the other men
finding out about this.

107
00:09:05,495 --> 00:09:09,647
Pictures in Life? Wine, women and song?
You got to tell them, they'll go nuts.

108
00:09:09,735 --> 00:09:13,171
I don't want them going nuts.
I want them thinking of their jobs.

109
00:09:13,255 --> 00:09:16,725
We could do our jobs in our sleep.
Why can't they know?

110
00:09:17,495 --> 00:09:19,167
Because I said so.

111
00:09:22,135 --> 00:09:24,205
My father used to say that.

112
00:09:26,775 --> 00:09:31,246
Dennis, you're the boss. You tell the crew
whenever you think it's right.

113
00:09:31,975 --> 00:09:34,489
Now, can we have just one more shot?

114
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:37,764
What? Are you kidding me?

115
00:09:39,055 --> 00:09:42,684
What are you smiling about?
You brought this unclean deck.

116
00:09:43,175 --> 00:09:47,088
Okay, get your money.
Once again, Jack Bocci gets stiffed.

117
00:09:50,935 --> 00:09:54,245
Clay, shouldn't you let the Sarge
go through Becker's stuff?

118
00:09:54,335 --> 00:09:58,328
He'll send it all to his widow. We don't
want her getting anything embarrassing.

119
00:09:58,415 --> 00:09:59,928
-Candy bar.
-Me.

120
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:03,091
Danny, which one do you like better?

121
00:10:03,215 --> 00:10:05,649
This one's shiny aluminum. Very modern.

122
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:10,451
This one's a little more homey,
with the brick and the little bushes.

123
00:10:10,535 --> 00:10:12,014
This one. Why?

124
00:10:12,295 --> 00:10:16,493
I'm going to open a bunch of restaurants
exactly like the first one.

125
00:10:16,735 --> 00:10:19,374
You'd get the exact same burger
in Detroit...

126
00:10:19,455 --> 00:10:21,605
...as you got in Baltimore or Philadelphia.

127
00:10:21,695 --> 00:10:24,573
Nobody wants the same food
wherever they go.

128
00:10:24,855 --> 00:10:27,085
Sure they do. It's comforting.

129
00:10:32,015 --> 00:10:33,971
-It is comforting.
-Love letters.

130
00:10:34,095 --> 00:10:37,087
-Wife or girlfriend?
-Read them aloud.

131
00:10:37,175 --> 00:10:38,528
Girlfriend.

132
00:10:38,895 --> 00:10:41,125
Pocket knife. Photos.

133
00:10:41,295 --> 00:10:42,887
Any clean socks?

134
00:10:44,735 --> 00:10:46,771
-Dirty book!
-I'll take it.

135
00:10:50,655 --> 00:10:51,929
Hey, look!

136
00:10:52,535 --> 00:10:54,605
-Becker forgot his good luck charm.
-Poor slob.

137
00:10:54,695 --> 00:10:57,368
Should have worn it around his neck.
He'd never forget it.

138
00:10:57,455 --> 00:10:58,934
-Rubbers.
-Dibs!

139
00:11:00,095 --> 00:11:04,611
Virge the Virgin won't need these. Swear
you'll tell me if you lose your cherry.

140
00:11:04,695 --> 00:11:06,253
I'll send it to you COD.

141
00:11:06,335 --> 00:11:10,044
-Clay, give me. Becker owed me $10.
-Don't take his money.

142
00:11:10,415 --> 00:11:12,645
Clam up, mug-face. He owed me.

143
00:11:12,735 --> 00:11:14,373
What do you know about Germany?

144
00:11:14,455 --> 00:11:16,013
-Pretty women.
-Good beer.

145
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:18,404
The hamburger's named after a town there.

146
00:11:19,415 --> 00:11:23,124
A little bird tells me
that's where they're sending us tomorrow.

147
00:11:23,215 --> 00:11:26,491
-Are you sure?
-We ain't going. Our plane's broke.

148
00:11:26,655 --> 00:11:29,089
-It's fixed.
-Let's go break it.

149
00:11:29,175 --> 00:11:33,134
-They wouldn't send us there our last time.
-They'd send us on a milk run to France.

150
00:11:33,215 --> 00:11:34,534
I hope so.

151
00:11:35,015 --> 00:11:36,084
They would.

152
00:11:36,175 --> 00:11:39,247
Anybody want the rest of this stuff?
Who wants the cigarettes?

153
00:11:39,335 --> 00:11:41,132
Let me take the razor blades.

154
00:12:26,655 --> 00:12:28,885
I'm sending this to your wife!

155
00:12:31,095 --> 00:12:33,609
We may be going to Germany tomorrow.

156
00:12:33,695 --> 00:12:37,165
My short, young life could be snuffed out
in an instant.

157
00:12:37,935 --> 00:12:40,051
I volunteered thinking it would be fun.

158
00:12:40,175 --> 00:12:41,893
I never thought....

159
00:12:42,455 --> 00:12:43,683
Oh, Faith!

160
00:12:43,775 --> 00:12:45,766
When I think I may never see the stars...

161
00:12:45,855 --> 00:12:48,085
...listen to good music, or...

162
00:12:49,175 --> 00:12:51,928
...talk to a beautiful girl like you.

163
00:12:52,335 --> 00:12:53,654
I'm sorry.

164
00:12:54,095 --> 00:12:56,734
You need a drink. I'll be right back.

165
00:12:58,935 --> 00:13:03,053
Danny, she is crazy about me.
She's going to jump on me any second.

166
00:13:07,815 --> 00:13:08,691
Had enough?

167
00:13:08,775 --> 00:13:11,369
How come they brought Life magazine?
To jinx us?

168
00:13:11,455 --> 00:13:14,811
Forget about it.
Let's get a couple girls and dance.

169
00:13:15,215 --> 00:13:18,287
Tell me the truth. The truth.
Are you scared?

170
00:13:19,055 --> 00:13:20,090
No.

171
00:13:20,735 --> 00:13:22,965
I'm Val. Come on.

172
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:31,126
It's my favorite food in the world!
You've never had a burger? Unbelievable!

173
00:13:31,215 --> 00:13:34,048
-You don't know what you're missing.
-They sound wonderful.

174
00:13:34,135 --> 00:13:36,808
It's been so long since I had any meat.

175
00:13:38,135 --> 00:13:42,014
I work the meat very slowly, very tenderly.
That's the secret.

176
00:13:42,095 --> 00:13:45,974
I rub in a little Worcestershire,
add garlic, a little thyme.

177
00:13:46,175 --> 00:13:50,134
Then I ease it into a patty, very gently,
so I don't bruise the meat.

178
00:13:50,495 --> 00:13:52,850
Virge, you're making me so hungry!

179
00:14:07,655 --> 00:14:11,011
We're going to have to excite people
on this bond tour. Inspire them.

180
00:14:11,535 --> 00:14:15,369
Now, Dennis is a fine man,
but he doesn't have your enthusiasm.

181
00:14:15,455 --> 00:14:17,650
I'm a qualified pilot, same as him.

182
00:14:17,735 --> 00:14:19,248
They didn't have a plane ready...

183
00:14:19,335 --> 00:14:22,725
...so he's the big shot pilot
and I'm in the dummy seat.

184
00:14:24,135 --> 00:14:26,888
You're no dummy, Luke.
We both know that.

185
00:14:29,575 --> 00:14:30,894
Being captain?

186
00:14:31,495 --> 00:14:35,454
Well, you've got nine men
who are totally depending on you.

187
00:14:36,255 --> 00:14:40,089
What did you do before the war?
I was in the furniture business.

188
00:14:40,375 --> 00:14:43,173
This isn't like making furniture,
see what I mean?

189
00:14:48,495 --> 00:14:51,168
-I'm not making sense.
-No, you are.

190
00:14:52,455 --> 00:14:55,811
Thanks a lot, Captain.
I'm going to get back to my date.

191
00:15:46,735 --> 00:15:48,453
I'll miss you, gal.

192
00:15:52,735 --> 00:15:54,691
We've been together a long time.

193
00:15:56,095 --> 00:15:57,926
You never let me down.

194
00:15:58,815 --> 00:16:01,283
I can't say that about many people.

195
00:16:04,055 --> 00:16:06,694
You know how to take care of your men.

196
00:16:07,095 --> 00:16:10,770
That's about the best thing
a fellow can say about any gal.

197
00:16:14,095 --> 00:16:15,767
I can't believe it.

198
00:16:16,695 --> 00:16:19,163
It's going to be over so soon.

199
00:16:22,775 --> 00:16:24,845
I can't imagine going home.

200
00:16:28,495 --> 00:16:29,610
Home.

201
00:16:35,135 --> 00:16:37,205
Won't be the same, will it?

202
00:16:49,815 --> 00:16:51,168
Good night.

203
00:17:08,775 --> 00:17:11,289
Virge, I wish you'd talk to me like that.

204
00:17:12,055 --> 00:17:14,933
The Captain'd murder me
if he caught us in here.

205
00:17:15,415 --> 00:17:17,087
Oh, jeez. Put that out.

206
00:17:17,215 --> 00:17:21,003
Come on. Let's get this over with
and get back to the dance.

207
00:17:21,975 --> 00:17:23,090
Wait.

208
00:17:24,295 --> 00:17:25,694
There. It was that.

209
00:17:25,775 --> 00:17:28,243
My wrench! I was looking for it.
Where'd you find it?

210
00:17:28,935 --> 00:17:30,334
Under my bum.

211
00:17:30,775 --> 00:17:33,608
Thanks. I thought someone had stolen it.

212
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:36,004
Virge, forget the bloody wrench.

213
00:17:38,655 --> 00:17:39,849
I'm sorry.

214
00:17:39,935 --> 00:17:41,493
Here, let me rub it.

215
00:17:41,575 --> 00:17:43,964
You've never done this, have you?

216
00:17:44,575 --> 00:17:46,964
Why? Am I doing something wrong?

217
00:17:50,255 --> 00:17:51,290
No.

218
00:18:03,975 --> 00:18:05,886
Is that your brand new plane out there?

219
00:18:06,015 --> 00:18:08,927
-Yeah. Mother and Country.
-Mother and Country!

220
00:18:10,135 --> 00:18:12,524
-We had our first practice today.
-How'd it go?

221
00:18:12,615 --> 00:18:15,413
We need a couple more.
If you guys have any advice--

222
00:18:15,535 --> 00:18:18,368
Get a gun, shoot yourself in the foot,
and go home.

223
00:18:18,455 --> 00:18:19,649
Now that's good advice.

224
00:18:19,735 --> 00:18:23,489
Are those size eight? How about
leaving a will saying when you get shot...

225
00:18:23,575 --> 00:18:27,204
...on your first mission
that those nice new pumps come to me?

226
00:18:43,615 --> 00:18:44,889
You okay?

227
00:18:47,495 --> 00:18:49,087
Nerves, I guess.

228
00:18:49,735 --> 00:18:51,965
We were just fooling around.

229
00:18:52,055 --> 00:18:54,364
I remember when I first got here.

230
00:18:54,575 --> 00:18:55,610
Same thing.

231
00:18:56,015 --> 00:18:58,654
I'd give anything to be in your place.

232
00:18:58,735 --> 00:19:01,249
One more and you guys get to go home.

233
00:19:01,335 --> 00:19:03,565
Sometimes I wish I could stay.

234
00:19:05,015 --> 00:19:07,654
Sounds crazy, but I'm used to it here.

235
00:19:08,655 --> 00:19:11,965
These guys....
These jerks are like brothers to me.

236
00:19:12,735 --> 00:19:14,726
I never had any brothers.

237
00:19:15,255 --> 00:19:17,291
I have four older sisters.

238
00:19:19,055 --> 00:19:22,013
When we get back home,
I don't know when we'll get together.

239
00:19:22,455 --> 00:19:24,286
We come from all over.

240
00:19:26,215 --> 00:19:29,013
I guess that's why
I keep taking their pictures.

241
00:19:30,695 --> 00:19:33,163
You'll be like that with your crew.

242
00:19:34,455 --> 00:19:36,047
Close your eyes.

243
00:19:40,815 --> 00:19:42,328
It's good luck.

244
00:19:59,135 --> 00:20:01,968
Clay, now's your chance.
Go up there and sing!

245
00:20:02,055 --> 00:20:04,523
I'm not going to make a fool of myself.

246
00:20:04,655 --> 00:20:06,486
You're a great singer.

247
00:20:09,695 --> 00:20:11,606
Ladies and gentlemen...

248
00:20:12,815 --> 00:20:14,646
...we have...

249
00:20:14,855 --> 00:20:17,494
... 10 very special men here tonight.

250
00:20:18,935 --> 00:20:21,130
I'm sure you know who I mean.

251
00:20:21,655 --> 00:20:26,171
They're about to become the first crew
in the Eighth Air Force...

252
00:20:26,415 --> 00:20:29,088
...to fly their 25th and final mission.

253
00:20:29,695 --> 00:20:32,926
Let's hear it for the crew
of the Memphis Belle!

254
00:20:34,535 --> 00:20:36,810
No, no. It's bad luck.

255
00:20:49,455 --> 00:20:53,209
Let's do Danny Boy in C,
and come in on the second chorus.

256
00:20:55,575 --> 00:20:57,088
Thank you, sir.

257
00:20:59,695 --> 00:21:02,971
This buddy of mine keeps begging me
to sing, and...

258
00:21:03,335 --> 00:21:07,726
...it looks like I ain't gonna get
out of it this time, so here it goes.

259
00:21:13,895 --> 00:21:16,887
No, get back here.
You're not getting out of this.

260
00:22:21,335 --> 00:22:23,087
I don't want to die.

261
00:22:26,415 --> 00:22:28,690
I don't want to die!

262
00:22:33,095 --> 00:22:34,847
I don't want to die!

263
00:22:57,655 --> 00:22:59,725
Captain Dearborn.

264
00:22:59,855 --> 00:23:03,734
Mission today. Breakfast, 0600.
Briefing, 0645.

265
00:23:03,815 --> 00:23:06,204
-Lieutenant Sinclair?
-I'm up.

266
00:23:09,175 --> 00:23:10,733
Where's Lieutenant Lowenthal?

267
00:23:10,855 --> 00:23:12,413
Val, where's Phil?

268
00:23:14,215 --> 00:23:16,365
In the can. He couldn't sleep.

269
00:23:16,695 --> 00:23:19,163
-Nerves.
-Can't say I blame him.

270
00:23:19,255 --> 00:23:21,052
Give them hell today.

271
00:23:47,215 --> 00:23:49,934
Oh, no. I can see it. I get back home...

272
00:23:50,015 --> 00:23:54,133
...I'm doing it to the wife, the door opens,
there's Danny taking a picture.

273
00:23:54,215 --> 00:23:56,445
Anyone seen my St. Anthony medal?

274
00:23:56,535 --> 00:24:00,653
-He's the patron saint of missing things.
-Yeah. I can't find him.

275
00:24:03,255 --> 00:24:06,247
Chief, I need you over here to look at this.

276
00:24:07,095 --> 00:24:09,006
Bogey, six o'clock low.

277
00:24:11,335 --> 00:24:13,803
-Good morning.
-Flying, Lieutenant?

278
00:24:15,095 --> 00:24:17,325
-What, are you drunk?
-Why, are you?

279
00:24:17,695 --> 00:24:20,846
-Are you kidding? We got a mission!
-I know. That's why.

280
00:24:21,095 --> 00:24:25,407
See, I'm going to get it today.
My number's up, my luck's run out.

281
00:24:27,335 --> 00:24:30,372
I'm gonna die, so I want
to give you something to remember me by.

282
00:24:30,455 --> 00:24:31,808
Get ahold of yourself.

283
00:24:31,895 --> 00:24:34,807
I don't want your watch!
We're counting on you!

284
00:24:34,895 --> 00:24:38,285
Want my gold cuff links?
They got my initials on them.

285
00:24:38,775 --> 00:24:40,128
You'll let everyone down.

286
00:24:40,215 --> 00:24:43,127
Want my New York Yankee baseball cards?
I got DiMaggio.

287
00:24:43,255 --> 00:24:44,973
What about my Rita Hayworth pin-up?

288
00:24:46,015 --> 00:24:48,927
Stick your finger down your throat.

289
00:24:49,055 --> 00:24:52,525
Stick your finger down your throat
or I'll do it for you!

290
00:24:57,295 --> 00:24:58,774
I feel better.

291
00:25:07,535 --> 00:25:11,494
Are you thinking of sneaking this on
the plane? I'm shocked at your behavior.

292
00:25:11,575 --> 00:25:13,725
Virge goes out for the pass!

293
00:25:15,815 --> 00:25:17,771
Hey, wise guys! Knock it off!

294
00:25:17,855 --> 00:25:19,129
Found it.

295
00:25:32,935 --> 00:25:36,644
These powdered eggs would gag a buzzard.
You done with that?

296
00:25:36,735 --> 00:25:40,011
It'll be a milk run today.
I can feel it in my bones.

297
00:25:40,095 --> 00:25:44,168
-Last time they sent us to Wilhelmshaven.
-I hope they don't send us back there.

298
00:25:44,255 --> 00:25:47,406
They wouldn't do that.
Not to my mama's baby boy.

299
00:25:49,255 --> 00:25:50,813
Give them hell today.

300
00:25:51,375 --> 00:25:53,093
-Bacon?
-Yeah.

301
00:25:55,815 --> 00:25:56,930
Eggs?

302
00:25:57,415 --> 00:25:59,849
Give him extra. He's real hungry.

303
00:26:04,815 --> 00:26:06,487
Good morning, men.

304
00:26:06,895 --> 00:26:08,533
Everything all right?

305
00:26:09,015 --> 00:26:12,087
Stop it! You won't have a chance
to do that after today.

306
00:26:12,175 --> 00:26:14,848
I wouldn't be so sure about that. Right?

307
00:26:20,975 --> 00:26:24,126
Well, looks like we've all got the jitters
this morning.

308
00:26:24,375 --> 00:26:26,525
I'll see you after briefing.

309
00:26:34,015 --> 00:26:36,529
How will he get through briefing?

310
00:26:36,655 --> 00:26:38,566
On a wing and a prayer.

311
00:26:41,615 --> 00:26:44,413
I thought we'd have more practice
before we went up.

312
00:26:44,535 --> 00:26:46,048
You'll do fine.

313
00:26:47,535 --> 00:26:48,888
Ten-hut!

314
00:26:52,815 --> 00:26:54,043
At ease.

315
00:26:57,615 --> 00:27:02,006
I hope you had a good time last night.
Now it's back to business.

316
00:27:07,335 --> 00:27:10,293
The target for today is Bremen.

317
00:27:15,895 --> 00:27:18,887
We have a chance to make a difference
in this war...

318
00:27:18,975 --> 00:27:21,443
...so let's do the best job we can.

319
00:27:21,695 --> 00:27:24,084
Leave the rest in the hands of God.

320
00:27:24,255 --> 00:27:28,806
With luck, it'll all be over soon,
and we can go back home to our families.

321
00:27:28,895 --> 00:27:31,887
Good luck. Over to you, Major Comstock.

322
00:27:32,015 --> 00:27:34,688
Good morning. Sergeant, get the lights.

323
00:27:35,695 --> 00:27:37,651
This is our target area.

324
00:27:37,855 --> 00:27:41,245
They're long rectangular buildings.
The only rectangular ones there...

325
00:27:41,335 --> 00:27:46,045
...so you can't miss them. Note the
S-shaped road to the factory for sighting.

326
00:27:46,255 --> 00:27:50,487
The Flugzeugbauer factory is a major
assembly plant for 190 fighter planes.

327
00:27:50,855 --> 00:27:53,085
Now, you're leading the group today...

328
00:27:53,215 --> 00:27:55,888
...360 planes are bombing
on your command...

329
00:27:55,975 --> 00:27:59,172
...so let's be accurate.
This is a civilian area here.

330
00:27:59,535 --> 00:28:03,210
This is a hospital. These are houses.
This is a school and a playground.

331
00:28:03,295 --> 00:28:05,934
Note the railway tracks, north northwest.

332
00:28:08,895 --> 00:28:09,884
Bremen.

333
00:28:09,975 --> 00:28:12,364
Bremen? Oh, we're dead men.
We're dead.

334
00:28:12,455 --> 00:28:14,844
-Shut up, Rascal!
-You shut up!

335
00:28:15,015 --> 00:28:17,210
Clay, what are the odds today?

336
00:28:17,295 --> 00:28:19,365
They'll overload us with bombs...

337
00:28:19,455 --> 00:28:22,765
...so it's 30 to 1 we'll crash
and blow up on takeoff.

338
00:28:22,895 --> 00:28:25,568
They'll throw every fighter they got at us--

339
00:28:25,695 --> 00:28:28,493
-Skip the gory details.
-Basically, we're finished.

340
00:28:28,575 --> 00:28:30,088
Chief's coming.

341
00:30:42,495 --> 00:30:45,612
-Tower, this is Army 485. Over.
-485, go ahead.

342
00:30:45,695 --> 00:30:48,687
This is a radio check.
Charlie, Uncle, Victor, Tango.

343
00:30:52,415 --> 00:30:54,804
As soon as you're ready, call in.

344
00:30:55,055 --> 00:30:56,408
Bombardier checking in.

345
00:30:57,175 --> 00:30:58,494
Navigator checking in.

346
00:30:58,815 --> 00:31:00,328
Top turret checking in.

347
00:31:00,935 --> 00:31:03,005
Radio operator checking in.

348
00:31:05,055 --> 00:31:06,488
Ball turret checking in.

349
00:31:06,575 --> 00:31:08,850
Right waist gunner checking in.

350
00:31:10,615 --> 00:31:12,287
Left waist gunner checking in.

351
00:31:14,575 --> 00:31:16,452
Tail gunner checking in.

352
00:31:18,135 --> 00:31:20,330
-Intercoolers.
-Set.

353
00:31:20,415 --> 00:31:22,212
-Generators.
-Set.

354
00:31:22,495 --> 00:31:24,645
-Fuel boost pumps.
-Set.

355
00:31:26,775 --> 00:31:27,764
Good.

356
00:31:27,895 --> 00:31:29,965
Crew, assume positions for takeoff.

357
00:31:30,055 --> 00:31:31,773
There's a jeep coming.

358
00:31:35,455 --> 00:31:39,607
We got a delay. Cloud cover
over the target. It could blow over.

359
00:31:39,695 --> 00:31:41,208
Stand by 'til further notice.

360
00:31:41,295 --> 00:31:43,889
-For how long?
-They don't tell me doodly.

361
00:31:45,295 --> 00:31:47,126
Damn it! They always do this!

362
00:31:47,215 --> 00:31:49,285
We're delayed.
Cloud cover over the target.

363
00:31:49,375 --> 00:31:52,651
They want us to stand down
'til further notice. Tell the others.

364
00:31:52,775 --> 00:31:55,972
Fellows, the target's clouded over.
We're delayed.

365
00:31:56,695 --> 00:31:58,731
Son of a bitch!

366
00:31:59,135 --> 00:32:00,124
Snafu.

367
00:32:00,215 --> 00:32:03,127
-Situation normal.
-All fucked up!

368
00:32:04,495 --> 00:32:06,167
Hear that, Clay?

369
00:32:06,295 --> 00:32:09,924
Okay, let's takes this extra time
to double double check everything.

370
00:32:10,095 --> 00:32:12,529
Let's make this our best mission yet.

371
00:32:12,855 --> 00:32:14,447
-Brakes.
-Didn't you hear?

372
00:32:14,535 --> 00:32:18,050
There's complete cloud cover over Bremen.
We're not going anywhere.

373
00:32:18,295 --> 00:32:19,489
Brakes.

374
00:32:21,895 --> 00:32:25,729
Set. They were set before
and they're still set.

375
00:32:25,935 --> 00:32:27,368
Intercoolers.

376
00:32:28,495 --> 00:32:29,291
Check!

377
00:32:30,415 --> 00:32:32,133
-Converters.
-On.

378
00:32:32,895 --> 00:32:35,329
-Generators.
-Off.

379
00:32:36,535 --> 00:32:38,730
-Fuel booster pumps.
-On.

380
00:32:39,735 --> 00:32:41,805
-Hydraulic pressure.
-Check.

381
00:32:42,055 --> 00:32:43,693
Fuel transfer valves.

382
00:32:44,495 --> 00:32:45,450
Off.

383
00:32:45,535 --> 00:32:47,014
Oxygen supply.

384
00:32:51,855 --> 00:32:53,766
Say, Pop, is it busted?

385
00:32:54,575 --> 00:32:56,008
I don't know what's wrong.

386
00:32:56,095 --> 00:32:59,531
I got one like that at home.
Let me take a look at it.

387
00:33:01,095 --> 00:33:02,733
-You're just nervous.
-I'm not!

388
00:33:02,855 --> 00:33:05,767
It jammed on me last time.
I'm the one who has to sit in it!

389
00:33:05,855 --> 00:33:08,415
I checked it out. It's okay. Take it easy.

390
00:33:08,495 --> 00:33:11,487
-Thanks, Virgin.
-The name's Virgil.

391
00:33:11,575 --> 00:33:12,974
Not to me.

392
00:33:13,095 --> 00:33:15,086
Rascal, I could tell you something.

393
00:33:15,175 --> 00:33:17,450
What could you tell me, Virgin?

394
00:33:18,015 --> 00:33:19,164
Nothing.

395
00:33:25,655 --> 00:33:29,409
You just call me on the intercom
and say you got a little trouble on the tail.

396
00:33:29,495 --> 00:33:31,770
I come back, you give me the gun
for five minutes.

397
00:33:31,855 --> 00:33:33,174
It's against regulations.

398
00:33:33,255 --> 00:33:35,405
Screw the regulations.

399
00:33:35,575 --> 00:33:38,567
If they found out they'd put my hot dog
in a bun and chow down.

400
00:33:38,655 --> 00:33:40,725
No one will know! Just you and I.

401
00:33:40,815 --> 00:33:43,454
I want to get my hands
on that gun just once.

402
00:33:43,535 --> 00:33:46,652
How will I get girls
if I haven't killed a single Nazi?

403
00:33:46,735 --> 00:33:49,408
Please. I'll do anything you say,
just name your price.

404
00:33:52,615 --> 00:33:54,367
-Anything?
-Anything.

405
00:33:55,015 --> 00:33:56,653
Give me your dog.

406
00:34:07,895 --> 00:34:09,487
Seven to one we're not going.

407
00:34:09,575 --> 00:34:11,725
Let's just get it over with.

408
00:34:12,095 --> 00:34:15,087
I'd rather get it over going
to a nice little French target.

409
00:34:15,175 --> 00:34:18,167
If we bail out we can hide out
in a French girl's hayloft.

410
00:34:18,255 --> 00:34:19,688
Is that all you think about?

411
00:34:19,815 --> 00:34:22,375
Yes, it is. I have to make up for you.

412
00:34:22,455 --> 00:34:25,208
-Grow up, Rascal.
-Shut up! You make me sick!

413
00:34:25,695 --> 00:34:28,289
Both of you just shut up!

414
00:34:28,415 --> 00:34:30,371
-All right. Calm down.
-Come on.

415
00:34:30,815 --> 00:34:33,648
Getting excited won't make this go faster.

416
00:34:34,215 --> 00:34:37,491
Just relax. Try to be
a little bit more like Phil.

417
00:34:41,335 --> 00:34:43,530
What do we got here? Poetry.

418
00:34:44,655 --> 00:34:47,215
-We have a poet on board.
-May I have my book, please?

419
00:34:47,295 --> 00:34:49,126
Read us a poem, Danny.

420
00:34:52,655 --> 00:34:54,532
No, nothing's finished.

421
00:34:54,615 --> 00:34:56,446
I didn't know you wrote. Read something.

422
00:34:56,535 --> 00:34:58,605
I want to hear some poetry.

423
00:34:59,015 --> 00:35:02,007
-Don't be shy.
-Read something you've started.

424
00:35:02,855 --> 00:35:05,494
We got a regular Shakespeare on board.

425
00:35:07,695 --> 00:35:10,528
-You got a good tone, Jack.
-Tone deaf.

426
00:35:17,855 --> 00:35:21,325
''I know that I shall meet my fate
Somewhere among the clouds above''

427
00:35:21,455 --> 00:35:22,729
Oh, Lord.

428
00:35:25,255 --> 00:35:29,407
''Those that I fight I do not hate
Those that I guard I do not love

429
00:35:33,975 --> 00:35:36,284
''Nor law, nor duty bade me fight

430
00:35:37,935 --> 00:35:40,449
''Nor public men, nor cheering crowds

431
00:35:41,695 --> 00:35:43,845
''A lonely impulse of delight

432
00:35:44,375 --> 00:35:46,843
''Drove to this tumult in the clouds

433
00:35:51,975 --> 00:35:55,092
''I balanced all, brought all to mind

434
00:35:56,655 --> 00:35:59,044
''The years to come
seemed waste of breath

435
00:36:00,135 --> 00:36:02,603
''A waste of breath the years behind

436
00:36:03,895 --> 00:36:07,410
''In balance with this life, this death''

437
00:36:17,455 --> 00:36:18,683
Captain!

438
00:36:19,375 --> 00:36:23,288
You're going up! Start engines
in five minutes! Five minutes!

439
00:36:31,415 --> 00:36:32,768
Lieutenant.

440
00:36:33,495 --> 00:36:36,646
If you want to, you can come back
and fire my gun.

441
00:36:36,775 --> 00:36:39,050
-I'm not giving you my dog.
-Lieutenant...

442
00:36:39,175 --> 00:36:42,167
...I don't want
that flea-bitten mangy old pooch.

443
00:36:44,055 --> 00:36:46,046
Wake up, Bill. Time to go to work!

444
00:40:15,015 --> 00:40:16,687
Here we go, boys.

445
00:41:37,175 --> 00:41:40,850
Okay, Mona baby,
we're going to get us a nice 109 today.

446
00:41:40,935 --> 00:41:42,971
We did it before, we'll do it again.

447
00:41:43,055 --> 00:41:46,286
Sweet-talking your gun won't help.
Just straight shooting.

448
00:41:46,455 --> 00:41:48,127
Hey, shut up, Gene.

449
00:41:48,615 --> 00:41:50,685
When I got my two Nazi fighters--

450
00:41:50,775 --> 00:41:52,208
Hey, shut up!

451
00:42:00,015 --> 00:42:01,812
-Climb power.
-I know.

452
00:42:02,415 --> 00:42:04,645
-Watch the cowl flaps.
-I know!

453
00:42:15,655 --> 00:42:17,247
Look out! Oh, my God!

454
00:42:50,175 --> 00:42:52,370
Luke, take over for a minute.

455
00:42:54,895 --> 00:42:58,854
Hey, it's Baby Ruth.
Who's our right wingman?

456
00:42:59,095 --> 00:43:00,767
Mother and Country.

457
00:43:00,975 --> 00:43:03,364
Oh, swell. The rookie crew.

458
00:43:04,335 --> 00:43:06,451
-Soup?
-No, thank you, sir.

459
00:43:12,775 --> 00:43:14,766
Captain, okay if I arm my bombs?

460
00:43:15,015 --> 00:43:16,528
Yeah, go ahead.

461
00:43:17,615 --> 00:43:19,128
Val, take this.

462
00:43:19,255 --> 00:43:22,053
-You're not going to die.
-Just in case.

463
00:43:22,215 --> 00:43:25,366
You're flak-happy.
Just do your job and shut up!

464
00:43:40,695 --> 00:43:42,128
Bombs armed.

465
00:43:42,215 --> 00:43:45,252
Rascal, there's nothing wrong
with the ball turret.

466
00:43:45,375 --> 00:43:47,093
Don't worry about it, Virge.

467
00:43:47,175 --> 00:43:48,813
I'm just doing my job.

468
00:43:48,895 --> 00:43:51,409
Now you do it. Thanks a lot, buddy.

469
00:43:52,375 --> 00:43:54,206
-Okay?
-Yes, thank you!

470
00:44:10,415 --> 00:44:12,975
We're at 10,000 feet.
Let's hear those oxygen checks.

471
00:44:13,935 --> 00:44:15,448
Clay, how you doing?

472
00:44:16,295 --> 00:44:18,331
Well, I'm just fine, Lieutenant.

473
00:44:30,015 --> 00:44:33,451
Captain, we're exactly five miles south
southwest of Yarmouth.

474
00:44:33,575 --> 00:44:36,248
We're in formation. This is the rally point.

475
00:44:38,495 --> 00:44:41,134
Okay, boys. We're on our way.

476
00:45:14,455 --> 00:45:16,810
Listen. I'm showing 30 below zero here.

477
00:45:17,095 --> 00:45:18,574
Let's be careful.

478
00:45:18,655 --> 00:45:22,045
Don't touch your guns with bare hands
or they'll freeze right to it.

479
00:45:22,175 --> 00:45:24,735
I don't want anyone losing any fingers.

480
00:45:24,815 --> 00:45:27,170
Check your masks for frozen saliva.

481
00:45:27,255 --> 00:45:31,806
The ice blocks your oxygen flow
and I don't want anyone passing out.

482
00:45:31,935 --> 00:45:33,687
In short, don't drool.

483
00:45:33,775 --> 00:45:35,970
In short, check your mask, Rascal.

484
00:45:36,415 --> 00:45:38,804
All right, let's keep the intercom free.

485
00:45:38,895 --> 00:45:43,127
Call out those fighters and don't shout.
We can hear you loud and clear.

486
00:45:43,495 --> 00:45:47,124
Let's make this our best run yet.
One we can really be proud of.

487
00:45:47,215 --> 00:45:48,773
Right in the pickle barrel.

488
00:45:48,895 --> 00:45:53,650
That's right. Keep your minds on yourjob,
work together, and stay alert.

489
00:45:55,495 --> 00:45:58,692
Captain, I'm getting A.F.N. here.
Can I put it on?

490
00:45:59,415 --> 00:46:00,643
Please, sir.

491
00:46:00,735 --> 00:46:03,613
All right, but when I say that's enough....

492
00:46:30,295 --> 00:46:32,570
''I hear gypsy violins''

493
00:46:33,895 --> 00:46:35,567
Lord have mercy, Jack.

494
00:46:35,655 --> 00:46:39,250
''When you dance with me I'm in heaven''

495
00:46:41,055 --> 00:46:44,491
Heaven? Come to my bunk,
I'll give you heaven, honey.

496
00:46:59,775 --> 00:47:01,811
Okay, let's test our guns.

497
00:47:18,415 --> 00:47:20,406
Little friends, three o'clock high.

498
00:47:28,735 --> 00:47:32,523
Oh, God. I'd give anything to fly a fighter.

499
00:47:34,135 --> 00:47:38,094
You're all alone. You can do anything
you want. That's flying.

500
00:47:38,215 --> 00:47:42,094
-It's the best pen money can buy.
-Why can't I have the baseball cards?

501
00:47:42,215 --> 00:47:44,410
They're for him. Here, Jack.

502
00:47:44,535 --> 00:47:47,971
I'm more of a football fan myself.
You know the Bears?

503
00:47:50,655 --> 00:47:52,725
-Here! Happy?
-Yeah!

504
00:47:52,815 --> 00:47:54,885
-Thanks, Jack!
-Thanks, Genie!

505
00:47:57,855 --> 00:48:00,289
Mother and Country calling Memphis Belle.
Come in.

506
00:48:00,375 --> 00:48:01,854
Read you. What's wrong?

507
00:48:01,935 --> 00:48:03,812
Nothing. Ijust had a question.

508
00:48:03,895 --> 00:48:06,534
We can only use the radio
in an emergency.

509
00:48:06,655 --> 00:48:08,805
Sorry. It was about my log book.

510
00:48:08,935 --> 00:48:12,325
Should I write down every radio
communication, orjust some?

511
00:48:12,415 --> 00:48:15,612
Write everything. Later you'll figure out
what's important.

512
00:48:15,695 --> 00:48:18,926
-We better sign off.
-Thanks. I won't bother you again.

513
00:48:19,215 --> 00:48:21,888
Smile. I'm going to take your picture.

514
00:48:29,015 --> 00:48:30,687
Hope it comes out.

515
00:48:32,095 --> 00:48:35,565
We're getting close to enemy territory,
so be on guard.

516
00:48:35,855 --> 00:48:38,608
Call out the fighters when you see them.

517
00:48:38,855 --> 00:48:40,686
Clay, you sang great last night.

518
00:48:40,775 --> 00:48:45,565
You should go to Hollywood and get
a record contract like Frank Sinatra.

519
00:48:45,975 --> 00:48:48,569
Yeah, so we can say we knew you when.

520
00:48:49,495 --> 00:48:54,330
I want to get a farm, a wife, and settle
down. Luke should go to Hollywood.

521
00:48:54,415 --> 00:48:56,007
He could star in the movies.

522
00:48:57,255 --> 00:48:58,734
Maybe. Maybe.

523
00:48:59,855 --> 00:49:03,450
I don't know what I'll do after the war,
except not work.

524
00:49:03,695 --> 00:49:07,734
Yeah, why go back to the daily grind
of being a lifeguard? Take it easy.

525
00:49:08,335 --> 00:49:10,166
I know exactly what I'm going to do.

526
00:49:10,255 --> 00:49:13,247
Virge, one more word about
that stupid restaurant....

527
00:49:13,375 --> 00:49:18,085
It's not stupid! At least I've got a plan.
What'll you do after the war, Rascal?

528
00:49:18,255 --> 00:49:20,007
Rob your restaurant.

529
00:49:21,175 --> 00:49:24,167
Val's smart. He's almost a doctor.

530
00:49:24,255 --> 00:49:27,088
What kind of doctor you going to be, Val?

531
00:49:27,175 --> 00:49:28,528
A rich one.

532
00:49:28,975 --> 00:49:31,443
And Phil? What'll he be after the war?

533
00:49:31,775 --> 00:49:33,572
I know. A mortician.

534
00:49:37,935 --> 00:49:42,087
Fellows, think about this.
My family has a furniture business.

535
00:49:42,455 --> 00:49:44,491
We make furniture then we sell it.

536
00:49:44,575 --> 00:49:46,770
You could all come to work for me.

537
00:49:53,015 --> 00:49:55,290
Like I said, don't give it a thought.

538
00:49:55,935 --> 00:49:59,450
Just what we need. Taking orders
from you for the rest of our lives.

539
00:49:59,615 --> 00:50:01,333
''Let's do the preflight check. ''

540
00:50:01,455 --> 00:50:03,810
- ''Don't hog the intercom. ''
- ''Call out them fighters. ''

541
00:50:03,895 --> 00:50:06,853
- ''Check your masks. ''
- ''Let's make this our best run yet. ''

542
00:50:08,575 --> 00:50:10,372
I'm not that bad.

543
00:50:13,295 --> 00:50:16,412
Danny, you didn't say what you'll do
when it's all over.

544
00:50:16,575 --> 00:50:18,691
I don't even like to think about it.

545
00:50:18,775 --> 00:50:20,811
What if something happens?

546
00:50:22,535 --> 00:50:25,971
We could all be old men
by the time the war is over.

547
00:50:26,855 --> 00:50:28,891
It just seems so far away.

548
00:50:30,055 --> 00:50:31,773
I'm sorry, fellows.

549
00:50:32,335 --> 00:50:34,053
Bandits, five o'clock!

550
00:50:42,175 --> 00:50:43,847
Go get them, little friends.

551
00:50:47,055 --> 00:50:51,128
Hold your fire 'til Jerry's in range.
Don't waste your ammunition.

552
00:51:04,375 --> 00:51:06,605
I said hold your fire!

553
00:51:06,695 --> 00:51:09,255
-That was Genie the weenie.
-Shut up, Jackass!

554
00:51:19,375 --> 00:51:21,047
-Six o'clock high.
-Nine o'clock high.

555
00:51:21,135 --> 00:51:22,932
Two 190s, twelve o'clock high.

556
00:51:24,095 --> 00:51:26,848
Three fighters, nine o'clock,
coming around.

557
00:51:26,935 --> 00:51:29,085
Top turret, eleven high. Can't reach them.

558
00:51:29,175 --> 00:51:30,733
Got them in my sight.

559
00:51:31,295 --> 00:51:33,490
Bogey, four high. Danny, see him?

560
00:51:33,655 --> 00:51:35,327
Two more, coming fast.

561
00:51:35,415 --> 00:51:37,326
M-109 going down at eleven.

562
00:51:45,175 --> 00:51:47,291
-Got one on my back.
-I'm on him.

563
00:51:54,375 --> 00:51:57,048
-Watch them, waist gunner.
-They're flying close today.

564
00:51:57,135 --> 00:51:59,729
Five o'clock high. Looks like a 190.

565
00:52:01,495 --> 00:52:05,932
-This guy at ten is smoking.
-The waist of Mother and Country got him.

566
00:52:06,015 --> 00:52:08,245
First time out he gets a kill.

567
00:52:09,095 --> 00:52:10,448
He's bailing out.

568
00:52:13,695 --> 00:52:16,926
Call out planes you see going down
so Danny can put them in his log.

569
00:52:17,175 --> 00:52:19,484
We've done this before, Captain.

570
00:52:20,335 --> 00:52:23,088
Fighters at nine, but they're staying away.

571
00:52:28,895 --> 00:52:29,850
Ten-thirty.

572
00:52:29,935 --> 00:52:31,812
-Ten-thirty high or low?
-Low!

573
00:52:32,215 --> 00:52:34,968
-Here they come.
-We've got company at seven o'clock.

574
00:52:38,215 --> 00:52:39,933
109, three o'clock.

575
00:52:48,775 --> 00:52:50,333
109s at ten level.

576
00:52:50,495 --> 00:52:51,644
Come on.

577
00:52:51,815 --> 00:52:53,043
Come on.

578
00:52:53,935 --> 00:52:55,653
Come to Papa, you--

579
00:52:57,335 --> 00:53:00,133
I almost had him! Damn it! Wiener!

580
00:53:00,215 --> 00:53:02,729
He's coming again. Get the bastard!

581
00:53:07,015 --> 00:53:08,971
Two at six. They're coming in.

582
00:53:12,655 --> 00:53:14,691
They're going after the first flight.

583
00:53:23,015 --> 00:53:24,812
Windy City's on fire!

584
00:53:30,455 --> 00:53:32,923
-Why don't they do something?
-Bail out!

585
00:53:33,855 --> 00:53:37,131
-Come on, wake up! Get out!
-There's a hole in the pilot's window!

586
00:53:41,775 --> 00:53:43,288
Hold on!

587
00:53:44,615 --> 00:53:45,843
Call in!

588
00:53:46,215 --> 00:53:47,933
Ball turret. Get us out of here!

589
00:53:48,055 --> 00:53:49,693
-Right waist.
-Keep calling in.

590
00:53:49,775 --> 00:53:52,164
-Bombardier.
-Navigator, check in.

591
00:53:53,015 --> 00:53:54,733
-Navigator!
-Phil.

592
00:53:55,455 --> 00:53:59,243
-Here. Navigator checking in.
-When I say ''check in, '' I mean right away.

593
00:53:59,695 --> 00:54:01,765
Someone's guts are on the nose!

594
00:54:02,015 --> 00:54:04,654
Any damage? Crew, check your stations.

595
00:54:05,055 --> 00:54:06,693
-Nose okay.
-Tail okay.

596
00:54:06,775 --> 00:54:07,969
Radio room okay.

597
00:54:08,055 --> 00:54:10,330
Keep calling out those bandits.

598
00:54:21,615 --> 00:54:23,048
They're gone.

599
00:54:23,455 --> 00:54:25,491
Yep. Hit and run.

600
00:54:29,335 --> 00:54:32,213
Ijust heard from C Cup.
They're taking the lead.

601
00:54:32,335 --> 00:54:33,973
-Hear that, Val?
-Roger.

602
00:54:34,535 --> 00:54:38,323
C Cup's lead plane now.
When they drop their bombs, so do we.

603
00:54:38,415 --> 00:54:39,404
Got it.

604
00:54:43,055 --> 00:54:45,125
Any chutes from Windy City?

605
00:54:52,615 --> 00:54:55,448
They didn't even have time
to pee in their pants.

606
00:54:55,615 --> 00:54:57,651
Here one minute, gone the next.

607
00:54:57,735 --> 00:54:58,963
That's the way to go.

608
00:54:59,055 --> 00:55:01,125
Do we have to talk about it?

609
00:55:01,935 --> 00:55:05,723
I heard a good one from their waist gunner.
What was his name?

610
00:55:05,855 --> 00:55:07,811
-Cooley.
-No, the left one.

611
00:55:07,895 --> 00:55:09,965
Am I talking to myself? Cooley!

612
00:55:10,095 --> 00:55:12,086
-I mean the right one.
-I know him.

613
00:55:12,215 --> 00:55:13,807
-Tall guy?
-Not so tall.

614
00:55:13,895 --> 00:55:15,453
Everyone's tall to me.

615
00:55:16,415 --> 00:55:18,485
-Lindquist.
-No, no.

616
00:55:18,855 --> 00:55:21,813
-Something like that.
-You're not even close.

617
00:55:22,295 --> 00:55:24,490
Anyway, a plane gets shot down.

618
00:55:24,615 --> 00:55:28,403
A guy bails out and is captured.
His leg is broken and they amputate.

619
00:55:28,495 --> 00:55:30,804
He says, ''After you cut it off...

620
00:55:30,895 --> 00:55:34,524
''...have a pilot drop it
over my base in England. '' They do it.

621
00:55:35,015 --> 00:55:36,414
Don't tie up the intercom.

622
00:55:36,495 --> 00:55:38,326
This is a quick one.

623
00:55:38,495 --> 00:55:40,611
The next week they cut off his other leg.

624
00:55:40,775 --> 00:55:44,290
He says again, ''Will you drop it
over my base?'' And they do it.

625
00:55:44,375 --> 00:55:46,843
The next week they cut off his arm.

626
00:55:47,095 --> 00:55:49,893
He asks again,
''Will you drop it over my base?''

627
00:55:49,975 --> 00:55:53,172
This time they say,
''Nein. This we can't do anymore. ''

628
00:55:53,295 --> 00:55:54,933
He says, ''Why not?''

629
00:55:55,015 --> 00:55:58,212
And they say,
''We think you are trying to escape. ''

630
00:56:02,335 --> 00:56:03,893
-Son of a gun.
-I don't get it.

631
00:56:04,335 --> 00:56:07,645
That was good, Rascal.
I think even Dennis liked it.

632
00:56:09,135 --> 00:56:11,569
Stoller! That's the guy's name. Stoller.

633
00:56:13,375 --> 00:56:15,047
Stoller wasn't on Windy City.

634
00:56:15,175 --> 00:56:17,643
-You sure?
-Wait. It'll come to me.

635
00:56:18,575 --> 00:56:21,169
Oh, yeah. I can see that guy's face.

636
00:56:22,895 --> 00:56:24,328
Yeah, me too.

637
00:56:27,815 --> 00:56:31,364
Well, whatever his name was,
it was a goodjoke.

638
00:56:33,815 --> 00:56:37,728
Let's stop fooling around.
Jerry's out there. Let's look sharp.

639
00:56:39,135 --> 00:56:41,968
Damn! Our little friends leaving already?

640
00:56:42,935 --> 00:56:45,369
They know when to run out of fuel.

641
00:56:45,575 --> 00:56:47,167
They ain't dumb.

642
00:56:53,935 --> 00:56:56,005
My medal! Oh, my God!

643
00:56:57,015 --> 00:56:58,971
My medal, have you seen it?

644
00:57:12,055 --> 00:57:13,454
Hey, Wiener!

645
00:57:15,135 --> 00:57:16,614
Thanks, buddy.

646
00:57:19,215 --> 00:57:22,207
-Why'd you do that?
-Now we're even!

647
00:57:24,055 --> 00:57:26,410
-Right waist, call in.
-I'm gonna kill you!

648
00:57:26,495 --> 00:57:29,055
Radio operator, see what's happening.

649
00:57:30,455 --> 00:57:32,730
Don't ever touch me when I'm on my gun!

650
00:57:32,815 --> 00:57:35,283
-You hear me?
-Break it up!

651
00:57:35,375 --> 00:57:37,172
-Break it up!
-Get him back on his gun!

652
00:57:38,095 --> 00:57:40,973
-What happened?
-Jack threw my medal out the window!

653
00:57:41,335 --> 00:57:43,565
I'm finished, Danny, finished!

654
00:57:45,695 --> 00:57:47,526
No, you're not. Here.

655
00:57:47,895 --> 00:57:49,692
Take my lucky rubber band.

656
00:57:50,135 --> 00:57:53,810
It works! I swear to God it works.
You'll be all right. Okay?

657
00:57:55,735 --> 00:57:58,044
You'll be okay! I want it back.

658
00:58:02,335 --> 00:58:04,132
Navigator, give us the position.

659
00:58:07,055 --> 00:58:09,410
That's the Third Reich down there.

660
00:58:10,055 --> 00:58:12,444
Now the shit really hits the fan.

661
00:58:33,375 --> 00:58:35,127
You better come take a look.

662
00:58:41,415 --> 00:58:43,849
We got to liven up that whole area.

663
00:58:44,535 --> 00:58:47,129
And make sure the banner is centered.

664
00:58:50,335 --> 00:58:52,405
What's the meaning of this?

665
00:58:52,615 --> 00:58:56,403
Put the piano on the platform.
It's just a little party, Colonel.

666
00:58:56,495 --> 00:58:59,487
I did not order this. I did not order this.

667
00:58:59,615 --> 00:59:02,129
Leave this to me.
The Memphis Belle's my job.

668
00:59:02,255 --> 00:59:06,965
My job is to approve everything on
this base. I didn't approve a homecoming.

669
00:59:07,135 --> 00:59:10,013
You're working too hard
at being a hard-ass.

670
00:59:10,295 --> 00:59:13,890
What's the harm in a party for these guys?
They're special.

671
00:59:14,295 --> 00:59:17,651
I have 24 crews up there.
They are all special to me.

672
00:59:19,175 --> 00:59:22,167
Great story, but baloney's my business.
I know it when I see it.

673
00:59:22,255 --> 00:59:25,930
All you care about is getting planes
in the air. Results. Brown-nosing HQ.

674
00:59:26,175 --> 00:59:28,370
-The only man--
-Come with me.

675
00:59:31,815 --> 00:59:35,330
You don't care if these men live or die.
It's just another airplane--

676
00:59:35,455 --> 00:59:36,729
Sit down!

677
00:59:41,055 --> 00:59:42,454
Start reading.

678
00:59:47,815 --> 00:59:51,171
This is from a father whose son
had his head blown off over Lorient.

679
00:59:51,255 --> 00:59:53,450
-You're cracking up.
-Read it!

680
01:00:01,175 --> 01:00:04,485
''Dear Col. Harriman:
Thank you for the letter about my son.

681
01:00:04,575 --> 01:00:06,566
''He must have made a big impression...

682
01:00:06,695 --> 01:00:09,163
''...because you described him exactly.

683
01:00:09,295 --> 01:00:11,684
''I wish you could have told me...

684
01:00:12,335 --> 01:00:16,408
''...how Tommy died, but I guess
we must be careful about security.

685
01:00:17,135 --> 01:00:19,444
''I'm glad he was brave to the end.

686
01:00:19,535 --> 01:00:22,129
''Maybe we raised him right after all.

687
01:00:26,575 --> 01:00:29,089
''We'll get used to him being gone...

688
01:00:29,375 --> 01:00:31,570
''...but not too soon, I hope.

689
01:00:31,695 --> 01:00:34,004
''I can read your letter to bring him back. ''

690
01:00:34,095 --> 01:00:37,292
''Dear sir, Your letter of December 10
finally made me realize...

691
01:00:37,415 --> 01:00:39,770
''...my husband is gone.
I have been living...

692
01:00:39,855 --> 01:00:43,325
''...in the false hopes
that the telegram was a mistake. ''

693
01:00:43,415 --> 01:00:46,725
''Dear sir, I am writing on behalf
of my parents...

694
01:00:46,855 --> 01:00:48,493
''...who appreciated your letter...

695
01:00:48,575 --> 01:00:53,365
''...about my brother's death. We were
all glad to know that Frank didn't suffer...

696
01:00:53,455 --> 01:00:55,685
''...and was not alone when he died. ''

697
01:00:55,775 --> 01:00:58,289
''I saw him off at the train station.

698
01:00:59,135 --> 01:01:02,571
''He was excited to be doing
something important with his life.

699
01:01:02,655 --> 01:01:05,488
''He couldn't stop looking
at his shoulder stripes. ''

700
01:01:05,575 --> 01:01:07,964
''I hope when it's over
the world will have learned...

701
01:01:08,055 --> 01:01:11,127
''...there's a better way
to solve its problems.

702
01:01:11,215 --> 01:01:13,604
''My prayers are
for my husband's comrades.

703
01:01:13,735 --> 01:01:17,125
''May they fly safely and return home soon.

704
01:01:17,975 --> 01:01:19,966
''Best wishes, Mrs. Peterman. ''

705
01:01:44,415 --> 01:01:46,246
Bandits, five o'clock!

706
01:01:48,095 --> 01:01:49,892
Bogey, five o'clock low.

707
01:01:49,975 --> 01:01:51,567
Three o'clock high.

708
01:01:53,855 --> 01:01:56,369
I said don't yell on the intercom!

709
01:01:57,735 --> 01:02:00,613
Breaking low at five o'clock.
Ball turret, watch out.

710
01:02:00,695 --> 01:02:03,687
Fighter at ten coming in a half-roll.

711
01:02:07,535 --> 01:02:09,287
That guy had blue eyes!

712
01:02:13,135 --> 01:02:15,603
Tail gunner, one coming down from six.

713
01:02:15,695 --> 01:02:17,413
190, twelve o'clock high!

714
01:02:17,655 --> 01:02:19,452
He's going for C Cup.

715
01:02:24,935 --> 01:02:27,813
Oh, God. He doesn't have a parachute!

716
01:02:29,975 --> 01:02:32,170
Everyone make sure you have your chutes.

717
01:02:32,335 --> 01:02:33,450
Parachutes?

718
01:02:33,575 --> 01:02:35,531
There isn't even room to breathe here.

719
01:02:35,615 --> 01:02:37,333
Then put your safety strap on.

720
01:02:37,535 --> 01:02:39,173
-It hurts.
-Do it!

721
01:02:49,135 --> 01:02:50,807
Ijust heard from C Cup.

722
01:02:50,895 --> 01:02:54,046
They're leaving formation.
We're in the lead now.

723
01:02:54,935 --> 01:02:56,414
Bye-bye C Cup.

724
01:03:01,775 --> 01:03:03,413
The bogeyman's gonna get them.

725
01:03:04,855 --> 01:03:07,653
Danny, get me C channel to talk to Group.

726
01:03:07,815 --> 01:03:09,567
Those poor bastards.

727
01:03:14,655 --> 01:03:16,134
This is the Memphis Belle.

728
01:03:16,735 --> 01:03:18,248
We're lead plane now.

729
01:03:18,335 --> 01:03:22,169
I'll do my best to get the bombs right in
and get us out safe.

730
01:03:22,975 --> 01:03:27,366
I'll need all the help you can give,
so let's tighten up and be on our toes.

731
01:03:27,495 --> 01:03:31,283
We're three minutes and thirty seconds
from the bomb run.

732
01:03:46,375 --> 01:03:47,524
One o'clock!

733
01:03:47,775 --> 01:03:49,254
Ball turret, watch out.

734
01:03:55,255 --> 01:03:58,053
I'm jammed! He's coming at me!

735
01:03:58,135 --> 01:03:59,204
Help me!

736
01:03:59,295 --> 01:04:00,967
He's coming at me!

737
01:04:08,855 --> 01:04:10,208
And your mother, too!

738
01:04:12,295 --> 01:04:13,410
Damn!

739
01:04:22,695 --> 01:04:24,845
Jack's hit!

740
01:04:24,935 --> 01:04:26,653
Val, go take a look at Jack.

741
01:04:26,735 --> 01:04:28,771
I'm two minutes from the bomb run.

742
01:04:28,855 --> 01:04:30,652
Gene, take care of it.

743
01:04:30,735 --> 01:04:33,010
Hold still! Let me look!

744
01:04:40,295 --> 01:04:41,967
What are you laughing about?

745
01:04:42,055 --> 01:04:43,932
It's a scratch! It's nothing!

746
01:04:44,015 --> 01:04:46,449
You're screaming like a stuck pig.

747
01:04:49,295 --> 01:04:51,525
They destroyed my favorite harmonica.

748
01:04:51,855 --> 01:04:54,369
Oh, you rotten sons of bitches!

749
01:04:56,615 --> 01:04:59,846
You son of a bitch.
You scared the shit out of me.

750
01:05:08,815 --> 01:05:10,487
How'd you do that?

751
01:05:12,135 --> 01:05:13,727
Magic.

752
01:05:14,735 --> 01:05:17,886
Flak! Twelve o'clock level. Here we go.

753
01:05:21,615 --> 01:05:24,891
They got about 500 antiaircraft guns
around Bremen.

754
01:05:25,015 --> 01:05:27,449
I could live without knowing that.

755
01:05:27,615 --> 01:05:30,209
Clay, what are the odds
of us getting out alive?

756
01:05:31,055 --> 01:05:33,250
I wasjust figuring that out.

757
01:05:34,055 --> 01:05:35,170
Damn.

758
01:05:37,815 --> 01:05:39,248
What's wrong?

759
01:05:39,335 --> 01:05:42,293
A big piece of Nazi flakjust hit my turret.

760
01:05:42,455 --> 01:05:44,491
-Are you okay?
-I guess.

761
01:05:44,655 --> 01:05:46,805
-You guess or you are?
-I am!

762
01:05:46,895 --> 01:05:50,410
All right. I hope everybody's wearing
their flakjackets.

763
01:05:58,855 --> 01:06:00,846
Mother and Country calling Memphis Belle.

764
01:06:01,015 --> 01:06:04,928
Danny, this flak is not like I expected.
Can't we fly above it?

765
01:06:05,095 --> 01:06:08,531
No, we got to fly straight through it
or we'll be off target.

766
01:06:08,775 --> 01:06:10,527
It'sjust four minutes.

767
01:06:10,815 --> 01:06:12,248
Yeah,just.

768
01:06:29,815 --> 01:06:32,613
Bombardier, I'm turning on the autopilot.

769
01:06:33,215 --> 01:06:35,490
You're flying the plane from here to target.

770
01:06:36,295 --> 01:06:37,410
She's all yours.

771
01:06:37,495 --> 01:06:38,644
Roger.

772
01:06:45,855 --> 01:06:47,447
Hold her steady.

773
01:06:47,935 --> 01:06:50,529
I've never seen it this thick before.

774
01:06:52,615 --> 01:06:54,412
Luke's hit! Luke's hit!

775
01:06:54,535 --> 01:06:56,571
-Dennis is hit!
-It's not me!

776
01:06:56,895 --> 01:06:59,455
It's not me. It must be you.
I think he's in shock.

777
01:06:59,535 --> 01:07:01,048
No, you're in shock!

778
01:07:01,135 --> 01:07:03,126
Val, get up here, quick!

779
01:07:03,215 --> 01:07:04,409
I'm on the bomb run.

780
01:07:04,495 --> 01:07:06,008
It's definitely not me!

781
01:07:06,095 --> 01:07:07,528
It's definitely not me!

782
01:07:07,615 --> 01:07:09,685
There's someone's blood
all over the cockpit!

783
01:07:09,775 --> 01:07:11,925
Captain, it's tomato soup.

784
01:07:19,375 --> 01:07:20,490
What was that?

785
01:07:22,575 --> 01:07:25,453
There's a hole as big as my dick
in the left wing.

786
01:07:26,135 --> 01:07:27,807
We're losing fuel!

787
01:07:28,815 --> 01:07:30,771
Virge, get on the fuel transfer pump!

788
01:07:35,215 --> 01:07:38,730
The electrics must be out on the left side!
I'll do it by hand!

789
01:07:38,815 --> 01:07:42,091
Luke, get back there!
Save as much fuel as we can!

790
01:07:42,175 --> 01:07:43,767
Two minutes to target.

791
01:07:52,655 --> 01:07:54,407
Bomb bay doors open.

792
01:08:16,975 --> 01:08:20,206
Bombardier to pilot. Target is covered.
Looks like a smoke screen.

793
01:08:20,295 --> 01:08:23,093
Fuel transfer complete. We saved a little.

794
01:08:24,415 --> 01:08:26,371
How does that target look?

795
01:08:27,135 --> 01:08:29,091
Target totally obscured.

796
01:08:31,215 --> 01:08:33,012
Thirty seconds to target.

797
01:08:55,295 --> 01:08:59,004
Val, I need those bombs on target.
The whole group is bombing with us.

798
01:08:59,095 --> 01:09:01,245
If I can't see, I can't see!

799
01:09:07,935 --> 01:09:09,334
What are you doing?

800
01:09:10,375 --> 01:09:14,084
We're going to bomb the factory,
even if it means going around again.

801
01:09:14,175 --> 01:09:18,168
That's suicide! It's asking the Nazis
to blow us out of the sky!

802
01:09:18,295 --> 01:09:19,808
I'm in command!

803
01:09:22,015 --> 01:09:23,448
Captain, what do I do?

804
01:09:37,455 --> 01:09:39,173
Bombardier, report.

805
01:09:39,695 --> 01:09:41,287
Visibility zero.

806
01:09:43,375 --> 01:09:45,172
If you do, we're dead!

807
01:09:49,015 --> 01:09:50,164
We're going again.

808
01:09:51,055 --> 01:09:53,523
Danny, get me C Channel to talk to Group.

809
01:10:01,015 --> 01:10:02,243
Get off!

810
01:10:04,495 --> 01:10:06,725
-Just drop them, Val.
-Shut up!

811
01:10:08,455 --> 01:10:09,604
Please.

812
01:10:14,375 --> 01:10:17,094
It'll be five minutes to get to the start
of the bomb run.

813
01:10:17,175 --> 01:10:19,086
Navigator, give me a position.

814
01:10:20,375 --> 01:10:22,366
Navigator! Did you hear me?

815
01:10:22,455 --> 01:10:23,729
Yes, sir.

816
01:10:28,495 --> 01:10:29,689
Everybody listen.

817
01:10:30,095 --> 01:10:33,167
I know you want to drop the bombs
and get out.

818
01:10:33,295 --> 01:10:36,207
But there's civilians down there. A school.

819
01:10:36,295 --> 01:10:39,571
If we don't drop the bombs on target,
innocent people will be killed.

820
01:10:39,655 --> 01:10:41,452
So what? They're all Nazis!

821
01:10:41,575 --> 01:10:42,803
Shut up!

822
01:10:45,295 --> 01:10:49,208
I don't want to do this any more than you.
We were sent to bomb a factory.

823
01:10:50,295 --> 01:10:54,413
If we don't do it, someone will have
to come back and do it for us.

824
01:10:55,135 --> 01:11:00,767
Nobody said this would be fun and games.
It's ourjob. Ours. Nobody else's.

825
01:11:01,975 --> 01:11:03,408
If we do this right...

826
01:11:03,655 --> 01:11:06,044
...we can always be proud of it.

827
01:11:06,255 --> 01:11:09,053
That's all I want, fellows. Believe me.

828
01:11:11,015 --> 01:11:14,690
Let's get back to work.
Call out those fighters.

829
01:11:29,775 --> 01:11:31,413
Bandits, three o'clock high!

830
01:11:31,495 --> 01:11:32,848
I see them.

831
01:11:48,295 --> 01:11:49,284
At eleven.

832
01:11:49,375 --> 01:11:51,127
They'll be all over us in a second.

833
01:11:56,255 --> 01:11:58,849
Scattered at four, lining up to come in.

834
01:12:02,135 --> 01:12:05,093
Bandit, 12 o'clock high.
Look out, Cockpit, he's heading for you.

835
01:12:05,175 --> 01:12:06,608
What, should I spit on him?

836
01:12:12,695 --> 01:12:14,208
Tail gunner, how you doing?

837
01:12:14,295 --> 01:12:15,967
Just peachy, Lieutenant.

838
01:12:17,335 --> 01:12:20,168
Well, ifyou need any help, let me know.

839
01:12:20,255 --> 01:12:23,213
I sure will, but I think I'm fine right now.

840
01:12:23,295 --> 01:12:26,605
Lieutenant, actually,
I do need some help back here.

841
01:12:26,935 --> 01:12:29,403
-Tail gunner, what's wrong?
-I'm running out of ammo.

842
01:12:29,495 --> 01:12:30,894
I'll take care of it.

843
01:12:31,975 --> 01:12:34,694
Why can't someone else?
Left waist, right waist?

844
01:12:34,775 --> 01:12:37,608
We got fighters all over us back here.

845
01:12:37,815 --> 01:12:40,045
I'm the only one not doing anything.

846
01:12:42,695 --> 01:12:43,969
Make it fast.

847
01:12:44,055 --> 01:12:46,615
Watch that fighter at ten
coming in a half roll.

848
01:12:48,255 --> 01:12:50,564
Jerry, five high. Gene, watch yourself.

849
01:12:50,775 --> 01:12:53,335
Breaking under. Watch him, ball turret.

850
01:12:53,415 --> 01:12:55,451
Read you, Bombardier.

851
01:13:03,375 --> 01:13:04,967
Watch it.

852
01:13:07,535 --> 01:13:11,084
I owe you one, brother.
Nice view you got here.

853
01:13:15,895 --> 01:13:18,728
Tail gunner, see that bandit at seven low?
He's all yours.

854
01:13:19,095 --> 01:13:20,653
Two bogies at four high.

855
01:13:20,735 --> 01:13:22,805
Messerschmitts coming fast.

856
01:13:23,535 --> 01:13:25,685
Ball turret, 109s about seven low.

857
01:13:25,775 --> 01:13:26,924
I'm on him.

858
01:13:27,015 --> 01:13:28,892
Two at three high. Keep you eyes open.

859
01:13:28,975 --> 01:13:32,012
Seven level, coming like a son of a bitch!

860
01:13:32,295 --> 01:13:33,614
I got him!

861
01:13:41,775 --> 01:13:44,528
It's the rookies. They got the rookies.

862
01:13:47,895 --> 01:13:49,965
Memphis Belle calling Mother and Country.

863
01:13:50,655 --> 01:13:52,293
Mother and Country, come in!

864
01:13:52,415 --> 01:13:54,690
Oh, my God! Help us!

865
01:13:54,775 --> 01:13:56,811
Oh, God! No!

866
01:14:36,615 --> 01:14:38,412
How many chutes
from Mother and Country?

867
01:14:38,495 --> 01:14:40,725
-I saw two.
-Yeah, two.

868
01:14:52,095 --> 01:14:53,813
Captain, this is the bomb run.

869
01:14:53,895 --> 01:14:56,773
-Bombardier, I'm turning it over to you.
-Roger.

870
01:14:56,855 --> 01:14:58,208
It's all yours, Val.

871
01:15:02,775 --> 01:15:08,008
Luke, after delivery I'll try some
evasive action to avoid this flak.

872
01:15:08,135 --> 01:15:09,409
Be ready on runner.

873
01:15:09,495 --> 01:15:12,407
Whatever you say.
You know what you're doing.

874
01:15:24,135 --> 01:15:26,649
Bombardier, how does that target look?

875
01:15:27,895 --> 01:15:29,089
Like shit.

876
01:15:51,135 --> 01:15:53,171
Captain, I still can't see a thing.

877
01:16:08,975 --> 01:16:10,886
Oh, Lord. Come on.

878
01:16:16,655 --> 01:16:18,646
Bombardier, how does that target look?

879
01:16:19,375 --> 01:16:21,684
Target's still covered, Captain.

880
01:16:23,375 --> 01:16:25,013
What should I do?

881
01:16:29,855 --> 01:16:31,811
Captain, do you read me?

882
01:16:33,975 --> 01:16:35,567
Yes, I read you.

883
01:16:40,575 --> 01:16:45,046
My sight says I'm over the target.
What do you want me to do?

884
01:16:57,735 --> 01:16:59,054
That's it.

885
01:17:00,455 --> 01:17:01,774
That's it.

886
01:17:01,935 --> 01:17:03,846
That's it! Bombs away!

887
01:17:44,535 --> 01:17:47,493
Okay, boys, we've done ourjob
for Uncle Sam.

888
01:17:48,055 --> 01:17:50,046
Now we're flying for ourselves.

889
01:18:06,055 --> 01:18:07,773
Bomb doors closing.

890
01:18:17,735 --> 01:18:19,407
Jerry, breaking low to nine o'clock.

891
01:18:19,495 --> 01:18:21,804
Ball turret, watch it! Watch it!

892
01:18:22,895 --> 01:18:25,887
I'm jammed. I'm stuck.
Shit, I'm stuck again!

893
01:18:26,615 --> 01:18:28,571
Virge, get me out of here!

894
01:18:28,695 --> 01:18:30,651
He's coming right at me!
I'm jammed again!

895
01:18:31,455 --> 01:18:33,013
Virge, help!

896
01:18:47,135 --> 01:18:50,889
Grab hold of me! Undo your safety strap!
Hold on.

897
01:18:52,855 --> 01:18:54,447
Come on up here!

898
01:18:55,135 --> 01:18:56,250
Grab onto me!

899
01:18:56,335 --> 01:19:00,567
I got you, Rascal, I got you!
Grab hold of me! Come on!

900
01:19:01,055 --> 01:19:02,647
Come on!

901
01:19:04,855 --> 01:19:07,050
You're okay. You're safe.

902
01:19:07,335 --> 01:19:12,614
You're all right. You're going to be okay.
Listen, you're all right. You're okay.

903
01:19:13,055 --> 01:19:14,647
Come here. You're okay.

904
01:19:15,255 --> 01:19:17,530
You're okay. You're going home.

905
01:19:28,655 --> 01:19:31,089
-Now what?
-Call in!

906
01:19:31,175 --> 01:19:32,494
Call in now!

907
01:19:32,575 --> 01:19:33,928
Fire extinguisher!

908
01:19:34,455 --> 01:19:36,366
I'll take care of Danny!

909
01:19:45,775 --> 01:19:47,527
Rascal, watch Danny!

910
01:19:53,335 --> 01:19:54,768
Danny's hurt.

911
01:19:55,175 --> 01:19:58,326
Val, Danny's hurt.
Go see what you can do.

912
01:19:58,415 --> 01:20:01,532
-How bad is it?
-I guess it's pretty bad, Val.

913
01:20:02,615 --> 01:20:05,732
-What are you doing? It's Danny!
-I can't. There's fighters--

914
01:20:05,815 --> 01:20:07,168
I'll cover your gun. Go!

915
01:20:07,255 --> 01:20:10,213
-Maybe somebody in the back--
-You're the doctor!

916
01:20:10,375 --> 01:20:13,094
That's just it. I'm not, Phil. I lied.

917
01:20:13,655 --> 01:20:17,409
I only had two weeks of medical school.
I don't know anything!

918
01:20:19,575 --> 01:20:21,008
Just do it!

919
01:21:04,855 --> 01:21:07,289
Somebodyjust shot a big chunk
off the tail.

920
01:21:10,935 --> 01:21:12,687
There's a fire in number four!

921
01:21:12,815 --> 01:21:16,569
Cut fuel! Feather prop!
Fire extinguishers! Generator off!

922
01:21:18,175 --> 01:21:20,928
-Call out those fighters!
-Danny's in bad shape.

923
01:21:21,055 --> 01:21:22,408
-How's Rascal?
-Okay.

924
01:21:22,495 --> 01:21:26,693
The extinguisher's not working. We got
to do something or we'll lose that wing.

925
01:21:26,775 --> 01:21:28,731
We got to dive.

926
01:21:29,695 --> 01:21:32,846
-I'll need your help to pull out of it.
-I'm not going anywhere.

927
01:21:33,095 --> 01:21:34,574
Memphis Belle to Group.

928
01:21:34,655 --> 01:21:37,727
We're diving to put out a fire.
Wingman, you're lead plane.

929
01:21:37,815 --> 01:21:39,533
Everybody, hang on.

930
01:22:22,335 --> 01:22:23,654
275!

931
01:22:23,735 --> 01:22:25,487
We're exceeding maximum dive speed.

932
01:22:25,575 --> 01:22:28,692
-We got to level out.
-The fire's not out. Just a little more.

933
01:22:28,775 --> 01:22:30,572
A little more and we'll lose the wing.

934
01:22:30,655 --> 01:22:33,123
Trust me. Just a few seconds more.

935
01:22:43,415 --> 01:22:44,404
It's out!

936
01:23:00,655 --> 01:23:01,644
Come on!

937
01:23:23,975 --> 01:23:27,285
Crew, we're at 10,000 feet.
You can come off oxygen.

938
01:23:35,175 --> 01:23:36,608
Thanks, Luke.

939
01:23:37,495 --> 01:23:40,089
Once in a while I do something right.

940
01:23:43,175 --> 01:23:45,564
I don't know what to do.
He's lost a lot of blood.

941
01:23:45,655 --> 01:23:47,054
How far is it to base?

942
01:23:47,135 --> 01:23:49,365
On three engines,
two or two-and-a-half hours.

943
01:23:49,455 --> 01:23:51,844
Two-and-a-half hours? He'll never make it.

944
01:23:51,935 --> 01:23:54,051
-Val, help him!
-What do you want from me?

945
01:23:54,135 --> 01:23:57,411
He needs a hospital.
All I have is a first-aid kit.

946
01:24:05,215 --> 01:24:06,933
Here you go, Danny.

947
01:24:08,415 --> 01:24:10,485
Okay, there's one more thing we can do.

948
01:24:10,615 --> 01:24:11,809
What? Let's do it.

949
01:24:11,895 --> 01:24:13,772
Put a parachute on him and push him out.

950
01:24:13,855 --> 01:24:16,130
-Jesus!
-It's crawling with Germans down there.

951
01:24:16,215 --> 01:24:19,332
-They'll take him to a hospital.
-If they don't kill him for fun.

952
01:24:19,415 --> 01:24:22,885
It's his only chance! Another crew did it.

953
01:24:22,975 --> 01:24:25,409
-He was conscious.
-Danny can't pull the cord.

954
01:24:25,495 --> 01:24:26,894
We can pull it first.

955
01:24:26,975 --> 01:24:29,284
-He could fall in a lake and drown.
-Can't we wait?

956
01:24:29,375 --> 01:24:32,333
We'll be over the North Sea in 10 minutes.
It'll be too late.

957
01:24:32,415 --> 01:24:35,009
We're going to do it, we have to do it now.

958
01:24:39,575 --> 01:24:41,531
-Watch his back.
-Keep his head up.

959
01:24:41,615 --> 01:24:43,571
-Don't push!
-Be careful.

960
01:24:45,855 --> 01:24:49,325
I'll go along with anything you say.
You're the doctor.

961
01:24:49,575 --> 01:24:53,170
-We just don't have a choice.
-Tell the men that's my decision.

962
01:24:53,615 --> 01:24:56,004
Phil! I don't want any argument.

963
01:24:58,855 --> 01:25:00,732
-Please don't do it.
-It's his only chance.

964
01:25:00,815 --> 01:25:03,773
No, you're his only chance,
but you're too chicken to help him!

965
01:25:03,855 --> 01:25:07,530
-If he stays on board, he'll die.
-If you throw him out he'll die.

966
01:25:15,975 --> 01:25:17,454
You can save him!

967
01:25:17,575 --> 01:25:21,853
So what if you're not a doctor yet?
You can help him. I know you can.

968
01:25:21,935 --> 01:25:24,324
He needs you! He's going to die!

969
01:25:24,775 --> 01:25:28,609
Don't do this. You'll always regret it.
I know you're scared.

970
01:25:29,575 --> 01:25:32,408
We're all scared! Now go help Danny.

971
01:25:34,735 --> 01:25:37,169
Let's go! All right. Hold his head.

972
01:25:49,135 --> 01:25:50,614
Come on, baby.

973
01:25:54,455 --> 01:25:55,968
There they are!

974
01:26:17,695 --> 01:26:19,094
-Seven!
-Eight!

975
01:26:19,175 --> 01:26:21,769
-No, nine!
-Did you get the one over there?

976
01:26:26,735 --> 01:26:29,090
-How many so far?
-Nine.

977
01:26:30,215 --> 01:26:31,807
There's another one.

978
01:26:31,895 --> 01:26:33,214
The Belle?

979
01:26:34,335 --> 01:26:35,973
No, sir, not yet.

980
01:26:41,495 --> 01:26:43,451
Feather prop. Cut fuel.

981
01:26:45,375 --> 01:26:47,889
Listen, we're flying on two engines now.

982
01:26:48,135 --> 01:26:52,970
Let's lighten up. Throw out everything.
We're close to home, so lose your guns.

983
01:26:53,455 --> 01:26:56,015
We never did get that fighter, did we?

984
01:26:56,495 --> 01:26:58,850
Oh, shit on a stick! Fuck!

985
01:27:00,335 --> 01:27:04,374
Lord have mercy.
You can have my bullets, too.

986
01:27:14,175 --> 01:27:15,927
Ain't that a pretty sight?

987
01:27:35,495 --> 01:27:38,692
''I balanced all, brought all to mind

988
01:27:40,575 --> 01:27:42,964
''The years to come
seemed waste of breath

989
01:27:43,935 --> 01:27:46,403
''A waste of breath the years behind

990
01:27:47,295 --> 01:27:50,332
''In balance with this life, this death''

991
01:27:51,415 --> 01:27:52,564
Yeats.

992
01:27:53,495 --> 01:27:55,087
It's okay, Danny.

993
01:27:56,015 --> 01:27:58,768
I didn't write that. It was W.B. Yeats.

994
01:28:02,135 --> 01:28:03,568
Take it easy.

995
01:28:08,535 --> 01:28:10,605
Don't do this to me, Danny!

996
01:28:13,775 --> 01:28:15,003
Damn it!

997
01:28:19,735 --> 01:28:21,453
One more like that.

998
01:28:28,895 --> 01:28:31,489
You try that again and I'll kill you.

999
01:28:58,735 --> 01:28:59,850
Landing gear.

1000
01:29:08,975 --> 01:29:10,408
Something's wrong.

1001
01:29:10,495 --> 01:29:12,531
Something is wrong.
My wheel didn't come down.

1002
01:29:12,615 --> 01:29:15,049
Fine. Take it back up. We'll belly land.

1003
01:29:16,815 --> 01:29:18,407
Nothing's coming up or going down.

1004
01:29:18,495 --> 01:29:20,611
The electrics must be totally out.

1005
01:29:22,415 --> 01:29:26,124
Virge, lower the wheel by hand.
Luke, tell me when it's down.

1006
01:29:26,215 --> 01:29:28,604
Crew, take positions for crash landing.

1007
01:29:28,695 --> 01:29:31,334
Get out of the way! Get out of the way!

1008
01:29:31,815 --> 01:29:33,612
Come on, Jack, you got to help me.

1009
01:29:47,735 --> 01:29:50,044
-We're losing number three.
-Are we out of fuel?

1010
01:29:50,135 --> 01:29:52,603
Fuel gauge is out.
How long can we fly on one engine?

1011
01:29:52,695 --> 01:29:55,334
I don't know. I guess we'll find out.

1012
01:30:44,615 --> 01:30:46,651
Get out of the way, Virge!

1013
01:31:05,255 --> 01:31:07,291
Come on! Faster! Faster!

1014
01:31:11,015 --> 01:31:13,324
Come on! I got it! I got it!

1015
01:31:40,135 --> 01:31:41,409
Hurry up!

1016
01:31:42,575 --> 01:31:44,645
We're not going to die!

1017
01:31:50,255 --> 01:31:52,974
Oh, my God!
It's only got one wheel down.

1018
01:32:25,655 --> 01:32:26,804
Flaps!

1019
01:32:27,415 --> 01:32:29,690
We're not going to die!

1020
01:32:34,535 --> 01:32:35,684
We'll live!

1021
01:33:34,815 --> 01:33:36,043
We made it!

1022
01:33:36,175 --> 01:33:37,688
We made it, Genie the weenie!

1023
01:33:37,775 --> 01:33:39,606
We're home, Danny boy.

1024
01:34:35,815 --> 01:34:37,168
I love you!

1025
01:34:49,495 --> 01:34:50,928
Welcome back.

1026
01:34:51,215 --> 01:34:52,853
Terra firma, huh?

1027
01:34:53,095 --> 01:34:55,006
Can we clear this area?

1028
01:35:00,295 --> 01:35:02,126
Can we have the officers in front?

1029
01:35:02,215 --> 01:35:04,206
Luke, come around to the front.

1030
01:35:07,255 --> 01:35:09,166
Officers in the center.

1031
01:35:09,655 --> 01:35:11,850
Just take the picture, Bruce.

1032
01:35:13,375 --> 01:35:15,206
What's wrong, Captain?
