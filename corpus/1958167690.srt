1
00:01:29,857 --> 00:01:33,559
This is the train to Montauk.

2
00:01:33,561 --> 00:01:35,427
The next station is Southampton.

3
00:02:21,408 --> 00:02:23,408
Hi, Nathan.

4
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:26,277
It's dad.

5
00:02:26,279 --> 00:02:28,714
I know it's been a while.

6
00:02:28,716 --> 00:02:31,182
It's about the farm.

7
00:02:31,184 --> 00:02:33,819
Call me back.

8
00:02:33,821 --> 00:02:35,888
Nathan, it's me again.

9
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:37,757
You need to call me back.

10
00:02:40,595 --> 00:02:41,728
I'm scared.

11
00:02:44,297 --> 00:02:45,732
I'm selling our land.

12
00:02:49,236 --> 00:02:55,242
Nathan, this is my last attempt
to reach you and your sister.

13
00:02:57,145 --> 00:02:58,744
There's something
you need to know,

14
00:02:58,746 --> 00:03:00,581
and I don't have much time.

15
00:03:06,921 --> 00:03:12,493
Our family killed them,
and they never forgot.

16
00:03:16,263 --> 00:03:17,598
And now, I--

17
00:03:24,438 --> 00:03:25,772
I got to go.

18
00:03:31,512 --> 00:03:32,613
I'm sorry.

19
00:03:36,651 --> 00:03:38,017
I'm sorry I'm late.

20
00:03:38,019 --> 00:03:38,517
I--

21
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:39,217
It's fine.

22
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:41,654
It's fine.

23
00:03:41,656 --> 00:03:43,190
Hey, you look nice.

24
00:03:47,028 --> 00:03:47,459
What?

25
00:03:47,461 --> 00:03:49,394
You do.

26
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:50,497
Thanks.

27
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:56,736
Is that--

28
00:03:58,673 --> 00:04:01,140
They put him in a tin?

29
00:04:01,142 --> 00:04:03,843
Yeah.

30
00:04:03,845 --> 00:04:07,412
OK, well, why not an urn?

31
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:09,247
Well, you have to buy an urn.

32
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:11,884
OK, well, I would have
given you money for it if--

33
00:04:11,886 --> 00:04:13,152
You weren't there.

34
00:04:13,154 --> 00:04:14,255
So--

35
00:04:18,226 --> 00:04:19,825
OK.

36
00:04:19,827 --> 00:04:21,761
I'm sorry.

37
00:04:21,763 --> 00:04:23,596
Um, the lawyer called me.

38
00:04:23,598 --> 00:04:25,698
He said that he can
meet us tomorrow

39
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:28,399
because he knows
today was a lot.

40
00:04:28,401 --> 00:04:31,837
No, no, I'd really like
to get this done today.

41
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:36,575
OK, well, I need to finish
up some things at work.

42
00:04:36,577 --> 00:04:39,346
So I'll meet you there.

43
00:05:28,229 --> 00:05:29,427
Yeah, it was OK.

44
00:05:29,429 --> 00:05:31,163
I mean, I picked a place.

45
00:05:31,165 --> 00:05:32,164
It's just--

46
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:36,569
Hey, I'm really
sorry about your dad.

47
00:05:36,571 --> 00:05:39,305
We loved working for him.

48
00:05:39,307 --> 00:05:41,674
Thank you.

49
00:05:41,676 --> 00:05:43,408
Yeah, Alice has been
managing the farm

50
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:46,347
with her sister, Scarlett,
for the past few years.

51
00:05:48,749 --> 00:05:51,183
It's strange that he
never mentioned you.

52
00:05:51,185 --> 00:05:53,752
Yeah, I guess that's just how
he was given he didn't really

53
00:05:53,754 --> 00:05:55,356
mention you either.

54
00:05:58,926 --> 00:06:00,092
The lawyer called me.

55
00:06:00,094 --> 00:06:01,627
He said he can't make it today.

56
00:06:01,629 --> 00:06:02,761
I need to get back to work.

57
00:06:02,763 --> 00:06:04,765
It's nice talking, Mirra.

58
00:06:07,134 --> 00:06:08,267
Well, did he say why?

59
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:58,419
We never forgot.

60
00:08:25,573 --> 00:08:26,607
Morning.

61
00:08:46,761 --> 00:08:52,598
I thought maybe we could
start going through his stuff

62
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:56,270
today, cleaning stuff out.

63
00:09:16,357 --> 00:09:19,825
Is that who I think it is?

64
00:09:19,827 --> 00:09:21,493
No way.

65
00:09:21,495 --> 00:09:23,028
No fucking way.

66
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:26,498
Yo, Nate.

67
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:29,468
Nate, pull over.

68
00:09:31,972 --> 00:09:33,974
The fuck.

69
00:09:38,746 --> 00:09:41,680
What the fuck are you doing?

70
00:09:41,682 --> 00:09:42,515
What the fuck's up?

71
00:09:42,517 --> 00:09:43,816
Oh my god.

72
00:09:45,152 --> 00:09:46,085
Holy shit.

73
00:09:46,087 --> 00:09:47,252
What are you doing?

74
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:48,487
man, get over here.

75
00:09:48,489 --> 00:09:49,988
off
the fucking road.

76
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:50,989
You're fucking fine, man.

77
00:09:50,991 --> 00:09:51,723
You're fine.

78
00:09:51,725 --> 00:09:53,025
Look at you.

79
00:09:53,027 --> 00:09:53,926
Look at what.

80
00:09:53,928 --> 00:09:55,160
Fucking heart attack.

81
00:09:55,162 --> 00:09:56,061
It's been what?

82
00:09:56,063 --> 00:09:57,863
Since high school?

83
00:09:57,865 --> 00:09:58,864
Shit, man.

84
00:09:58,866 --> 00:09:59,865
Shit.

85
00:09:59,867 --> 00:10:00,766
Dude, it's good to see you.

86
00:10:00,768 --> 00:10:01,501
It's good to see you.

87
00:10:01,503 --> 00:10:02,034
What's up?

88
00:10:02,036 --> 00:10:02,668
What's up, man?

89
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:03,168
Nothing.

90
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:04,002
How are you?

91
00:10:04,004 --> 00:10:05,370
How are you doing?

92
00:10:05,372 --> 00:10:07,005
Oh, yeah, I'm just working
for my dad and shit.

93
00:10:07,007 --> 00:10:08,006
It's fine.

94
00:10:08,008 --> 00:10:09,708
We have boring and fuck.

95
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:10,709
Yeah, yeah.

96
00:10:10,711 --> 00:10:14,012
Yeah, whatever, but like--

97
00:10:14,014 --> 00:10:15,515
oh, shit.

98
00:10:15,517 --> 00:10:19,685
Wait, did-- your dad just
killed himself, didn't he?

99
00:10:19,687 --> 00:10:20,185
Yeah.

100
00:10:20,187 --> 00:10:21,120
Oh, shit.

101
00:10:21,122 --> 00:10:22,020
Yeah.

102
00:10:22,022 --> 00:10:23,856
Yeah, that sucks, bro.

103
00:10:23,858 --> 00:10:24,557
That sucks.

104
00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:25,023
That sucks.

105
00:10:25,025 --> 00:10:26,024
Thanks.

106
00:10:26,026 --> 00:10:28,062
How did he-- how did he do it?

107
00:10:31,098 --> 00:10:33,098
He drowned.

108
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:34,700
He drowned.

109
00:10:34,702 --> 00:10:36,201
I thought-- oh, OK, I thought
you said he killed himself.

110
00:10:36,203 --> 00:10:37,035
He drow-- he--

111
00:10:37,037 --> 00:10:37,736
I did say that.

112
00:10:37,738 --> 00:10:38,704
He drowned?

113
00:10:38,706 --> 00:10:40,540
No, he killed himself.

114
00:10:40,542 --> 00:10:41,608
Yeah, drowning.

115
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:42,107
Fuck.

116
00:10:42,109 --> 00:10:42,875
Fuck, man.

117
00:10:42,877 --> 00:10:43,709
That's heavy.

118
00:10:43,711 --> 00:10:45,277
That's heavy, man.

119
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:46,879
Your dad was the man, you know?

120
00:10:46,881 --> 00:10:48,213
He was a cool guy.

121
00:10:48,215 --> 00:10:49,047
Pretty cool guy.

122
00:10:49,049 --> 00:10:50,550
Yeah, he was nice.

123
00:10:50,552 --> 00:10:56,488
Yeah, so-- so I guess that
means your sister's around.

124
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:57,890
No, no.

125
00:10:57,892 --> 00:10:58,757
Yes, she is.

126
00:10:58,759 --> 00:10:59,424
Not a fucking chance.

127
00:10:59,426 --> 00:10:59,892
What?

128
00:10:59,894 --> 00:11:00,759
What?

129
00:11:00,761 --> 00:11:01,727
You fucking dreaming.

130
00:11:02,564 --> 00:11:04,062
All right, all right, all right.

131
00:11:04,064 --> 00:11:07,132
Yeah, yeah, yeah, all right,
so look, I'm-- look, hey,

132
00:11:07,134 --> 00:11:08,400
I'm having a little party later.

133
00:11:08,402 --> 00:11:09,502
You should come by.

134
00:11:09,504 --> 00:11:12,171
You should bring your sister.

135
00:11:12,173 --> 00:11:12,971
Yeah, come on.

136
00:11:12,973 --> 00:11:13,606
Come on.

137
00:11:13,608 --> 00:11:14,607
Come on.

138
00:11:14,609 --> 00:11:15,841
All right, it's in
my mom's basement.

139
00:11:15,843 --> 00:11:16,576
You know exactly where that is.

140
00:11:16,578 --> 00:11:17,342
I do know.

141
00:11:17,344 --> 00:11:18,911
You remember where that is.

142
00:11:18,913 --> 00:11:21,113
Yeah, so I'm going to see you
both there later, all right?

143
00:11:21,115 --> 00:11:22,247
You will see me later maybe.

144
00:11:22,249 --> 00:11:23,782
I will see you both there later.

145
00:11:23,784 --> 00:11:28,521
You will never see my sister
again in your fucking life.

146
00:11:28,523 --> 00:11:31,456
Take a cold shower
with soap maybe.

147
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:33,125
You smell like dog shit.

148
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:08,621
You leaving?

149
00:13:08,623 --> 00:13:12,924
Oh, hey, yeah, no, I was
looking for somebody,

150
00:13:12,926 --> 00:13:14,192
but I don't think they're here.

151
00:13:14,194 --> 00:13:15,193
So--

152
00:13:15,195 --> 00:13:18,030
Don't feel like a party, huh?

153
00:13:18,032 --> 00:13:19,933
Yeah, something like that.

154
00:13:22,236 --> 00:13:23,802
I get it.

155
00:13:23,804 --> 00:13:26,238
It's the same 15 people sitting
in a cloud of smoke talking

156
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,907
about the good old days, right?

157
00:13:28,909 --> 00:13:30,443
Do you want one?

158
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,215
I don't bite.

159
00:13:37,051 --> 00:13:38,286
Yeah, all right.

160
00:13:40,287 --> 00:13:41,388
Want a beer?

161
00:13:43,957 --> 00:13:44,657
No, thanks.

162
00:13:44,659 --> 00:13:45,157
I'm good.

163
00:13:45,159 --> 00:13:46,560
Thank you.

164
00:13:48,829 --> 00:13:49,930
So--

165
00:13:52,966 --> 00:13:54,068
What?

166
00:13:56,738 --> 00:13:59,073
I feel like we got
off to a bad start.

167
00:14:03,844 --> 00:14:04,610
Well, I'm sorry.

168
00:14:04,612 --> 00:14:06,345
What was your name again?

169
00:14:06,347 --> 00:14:07,580
Alice.

170
00:14:07,582 --> 00:14:08,347
Alice.

171
00:14:08,349 --> 00:14:09,081
That's right.

172
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:10,750
I'm Nathan.

173
00:14:10,752 --> 00:14:11,283
I know.

174
00:14:11,285 --> 00:14:12,320
I didn't forget.

175
00:14:15,289 --> 00:14:17,490
Names aren't really
my thing, I guess.

176
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:25,097
So you grew up out here?

177
00:14:25,099 --> 00:14:26,200
Kinda.

178
00:14:29,771 --> 00:14:30,469
It's weird.

179
00:14:30,471 --> 00:14:32,003
I don't remember you.

180
00:14:32,005 --> 00:14:33,438
You look kind of familiar, but--

181
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,374
Well, I didn't go to high
school with you guys.

182
00:14:35,376 --> 00:14:37,610
I was home schooled so--

183
00:14:37,612 --> 00:14:40,145
What was that like?

184
00:14:40,147 --> 00:14:43,181
Do you care?

185
00:14:43,183 --> 00:14:46,318
Not really, no.

186
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:50,824
It was fine, boring, lonely.

187
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:56,629
I had my sister, though,
which was fine, I guess.

188
00:14:56,631 --> 00:14:59,066
She works on the farm
with your dad too.

189
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:04,305
Worked.

190
00:15:07,207 --> 00:15:09,709
He's dead.

191
00:15:09,711 --> 00:15:10,644
I know.

192
00:15:13,313 --> 00:15:14,312
I mean, I'm fine.

193
00:15:14,314 --> 00:15:15,046
I'm fine.

194
00:15:15,048 --> 00:15:17,215
I'm just saying.

195
00:15:17,217 --> 00:15:19,184
OK, well, we're
working our asses off

196
00:15:19,186 --> 00:15:20,318
for you guys every day still.

197
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,721
So--

198
00:15:21,723 --> 00:15:24,322
I know.

199
00:15:24,324 --> 00:15:25,425
Right.

200
00:15:28,596 --> 00:15:30,162
I'm being a dick.

201
00:15:30,164 --> 00:15:31,930
I'm sorry.

202
00:15:31,932 --> 00:15:32,998
I don't know why.

203
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,199
I'm sorry.

204
00:15:34,201 --> 00:15:35,336
You're fine.

205
00:15:42,176 --> 00:15:44,376
What?

206
00:15:44,378 --> 00:15:47,045
So you guys are similar.

207
00:15:47,047 --> 00:15:49,181
Who?

208
00:15:49,183 --> 00:15:50,517
You and your dad.

209
00:15:54,188 --> 00:15:55,588
Yeah, OK.

210
00:15:55,590 --> 00:16:00,091
Thanks, I'm going to go,
and thanks for the smoke.

211
00:17:59,479 --> 00:18:01,348
You know what I was thinking?

212
00:18:03,985 --> 00:18:07,553
I was thinking about
going to Montauk.

213
00:18:07,555 --> 00:18:12,324
I might go today, I mean.

214
00:18:12,326 --> 00:18:17,763
Cool, with who's car?

215
00:18:17,765 --> 00:18:20,332
With you, obviously.

216
00:18:20,334 --> 00:18:21,033
I can't.

217
00:18:21,035 --> 00:18:22,100
I'm working.

218
00:18:22,102 --> 00:18:23,002
But it's the weekend.

219
00:18:23,004 --> 00:18:25,337
Yeah, yeah, it is the weekend.

220
00:18:25,339 --> 00:18:26,672
Yeah, we could go.

221
00:18:26,674 --> 00:18:29,174
We could stack rocks
like when we were kids.

222
00:18:29,176 --> 00:18:30,610
I can't.

223
00:18:30,612 --> 00:18:33,546
I'm sorry.

224
00:18:33,548 --> 00:18:42,922
OK, yeah, I want to go.

225
00:18:42,924 --> 00:18:46,560
I don't-- I'd really
love it if you came.

226
00:18:53,367 --> 00:18:57,637
Hey, I'll drive.

227
00:19:00,541 --> 00:19:02,108
What?

228
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:02,708
You're there.

229
00:20:01,936 --> 00:20:04,603
God, do you remember how
long this drive home--

230
00:20:04,605 --> 00:20:06,939
You slept the whole way here.

231
00:20:06,941 --> 00:20:09,942
It's only because I
couldn't sleep last night.

232
00:20:09,944 --> 00:20:11,777
Why not?

233
00:20:11,779 --> 00:20:13,447
I don't know.

234
00:20:21,455 --> 00:20:28,627
I keep seeing him drowning.

235
00:20:28,629 --> 00:20:32,330
Yeah, that's-- it's
probably normal.

236
00:20:32,332 --> 00:20:34,299
It's just this place.

237
00:20:34,301 --> 00:20:35,802
It's just-- it's not--

238
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:44,309
it's OK to get sad, OK?

239
00:20:44,311 --> 00:20:46,712
You know, mourn.

240
00:20:46,714 --> 00:20:49,481
Do what you got
to do, but don't--

241
00:20:49,483 --> 00:20:51,418
don't do that, OK?

242
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:56,722
I feel so guilty, you know?

243
00:20:56,724 --> 00:20:57,857
I can't shake it.

244
00:20:57,859 --> 00:20:59,826
Guilt does nothing to help you.

245
00:21:04,832 --> 00:21:06,766
I mean, don't you?

246
00:21:06,768 --> 00:21:07,600
Do I what?

247
00:21:07,602 --> 00:21:08,399
Do I feel guilty?

248
00:21:08,401 --> 00:21:09,168
Yeah.

249
00:21:09,170 --> 00:21:10,503
No, why would I?

250
00:21:10,505 --> 00:21:11,670
I don't know.

251
00:21:11,672 --> 00:21:14,073
The land, it's been
with our family

252
00:21:14,075 --> 00:21:15,841
for so long, generations.

253
00:21:15,843 --> 00:21:17,342
Yeah, exactly.

254
00:21:17,344 --> 00:21:18,177
That's too long.

255
00:21:18,179 --> 00:21:18,944
What?

256
00:21:18,946 --> 00:21:20,581
Are you going to farm it?

257
00:21:23,184 --> 00:21:27,452
Let's just take the money,
and get you on your feet fine.

258
00:21:27,454 --> 00:21:28,187
I'm good.

259
00:21:28,189 --> 00:21:28,854
I'm good.

260
00:21:28,856 --> 00:21:30,189
No, I mean, financially.

261
00:21:30,191 --> 00:21:33,458
We sell this place,
and we will be set.

262
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:34,727
I don't care about money.

263
00:21:34,729 --> 00:21:36,929
Well, then can you
stop borrowing from me.

264
00:22:16,771 --> 00:22:17,904
Nathan.

265
00:22:19,807 --> 00:22:21,640
Nathan.

266
00:22:21,642 --> 00:22:22,975
Nathan, get up.

267
00:22:25,246 --> 00:22:26,313
Nathan.

268
00:22:28,249 --> 00:22:30,584
I'm up, sorry.

269
00:22:40,261 --> 00:22:41,760
Oh, you got to
jump in the water.

270
00:22:41,762 --> 00:22:42,928
It's still warm.

271
00:22:42,930 --> 00:22:45,699
I got to get back
and work more so--

272
00:22:48,536 --> 00:22:50,669
Why don't you come over
for dinner tonight?

273
00:22:50,671 --> 00:22:52,137
We're having fish.

274
00:22:52,139 --> 00:22:53,939
I would love to, but I--

275
00:22:53,941 --> 00:22:55,140
You have to come.

276
00:22:55,142 --> 00:22:57,109
Because Scar, she
caught it yesterday.

277
00:22:57,111 --> 00:22:58,310
Wait, she caught it?

278
00:22:58,312 --> 00:23:00,846
Yeah, yeah she's, a
fisherman-- woman.

279
00:23:00,848 --> 00:23:01,647
Fisherwoman?

280
00:23:01,649 --> 00:23:02,615
I don't know.

281
00:23:02,617 --> 00:23:04,016
I don't know.

282
00:23:04,018 --> 00:23:05,651
But anyway, it's going to
be fresh and delicious,

283
00:23:05,653 --> 00:23:07,019
and we're going
to pick vegetables

284
00:23:07,021 --> 00:23:09,622
from the fields, your fields.

285
00:23:09,624 --> 00:23:10,723
Um, I--

286
00:23:10,725 --> 00:23:11,957
Come at 5:00, OK?

287
00:23:11,959 --> 00:23:13,794
5:00, OK?

288
00:23:32,914 --> 00:23:33,846
Hey, Mirra.

289
00:23:33,848 --> 00:23:34,680
Hi.

290
00:23:34,682 --> 00:23:36,315
Hi, Greg.

291
00:23:36,317 --> 00:23:37,816
Long time, huh?

292
00:23:37,818 --> 00:23:39,985
Yeah.

293
00:23:39,987 --> 00:23:41,887
You look good.

294
00:23:41,889 --> 00:23:44,358
You know, for a.

295
00:23:46,827 --> 00:23:51,363
So what's up?

296
00:23:51,365 --> 00:23:53,165
Is Nathan here?

297
00:23:53,167 --> 00:23:56,335
Yeah, I-- I don't know if--

298
00:23:56,337 --> 00:23:59,405
I can get him if you just
want to wait for a second.

299
00:23:59,407 --> 00:24:00,172
Yeah, I'll wait.

300
00:24:00,174 --> 00:24:01,041
OK.

301
00:24:06,013 --> 00:24:06,879
Get up here.

302
00:24:06,881 --> 00:24:07,846
What are you doing here?

303
00:24:07,848 --> 00:24:08,847
Come on.

304
00:24:08,849 --> 00:24:09,782
Hi, hi.

305
00:24:09,784 --> 00:24:11,452
Good to see you, buddy.

306
00:24:16,023 --> 00:24:17,856
Kind of bitchy, right?

307
00:24:17,858 --> 00:24:18,791
OK.

308
00:24:18,793 --> 00:24:20,926
Let's go out tonight.

309
00:24:20,928 --> 00:24:22,460
No, I can't.

310
00:24:22,462 --> 00:24:23,062
Why?

311
00:24:23,064 --> 00:24:25,030
Because I can't.

312
00:24:25,032 --> 00:24:26,565
Come on, man.

313
00:24:26,567 --> 00:24:28,968
Come on, we got to
go catch up at least.

314
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:33,305
I mean, like, we
should catch up.

315
00:24:33,307 --> 00:24:34,873
I mean, we haven't
chilled at all.

316
00:24:34,875 --> 00:24:35,975
You didn't even
come to my party.

317
00:24:35,977 --> 00:24:37,209
I was at your party.

318
00:24:37,211 --> 00:24:38,944
Wait, you got a--
you got a lighter?

319
00:24:38,946 --> 00:24:40,047
Yeah.

320
00:24:44,552 --> 00:24:45,985
Thanks, man.

321
00:24:55,229 --> 00:24:57,730
You know, I grow now too.

322
00:24:57,732 --> 00:24:58,630
Oh, shit, dude.

323
00:24:58,632 --> 00:24:59,932
I forgot to tell you.

324
00:24:59,934 --> 00:25:01,567
I fucked this girl from
HB the other night.

325
00:25:01,569 --> 00:25:04,171
You should have seen
the fucking tits on her.

326
00:25:06,073 --> 00:25:07,773
Hey, butter face, of course.

327
00:25:07,775 --> 00:25:10,576
Well, OK, well, look at yours.

328
00:25:10,578 --> 00:25:11,744
Fuck you.

329
00:25:11,746 --> 00:25:15,080
You got anything to drink
around here, by the way?

330
00:25:15,082 --> 00:25:16,950
No, man, we're empty.

331
00:25:19,253 --> 00:25:22,454
You know, your dad and I used
to chill at the corner bar

332
00:25:22,456 --> 00:25:24,423
all the time.

333
00:25:24,425 --> 00:25:26,091
Really?

334
00:25:26,093 --> 00:25:30,763
Yeah, I'm going to come back.

335
00:25:30,765 --> 00:25:31,530
I'm sure you will.

336
00:25:31,532 --> 00:25:32,197
I'm coming back.

337
00:25:32,199 --> 00:25:33,699
Yeah, I'm sure you will.

338
00:25:33,701 --> 00:25:35,000
Tell your sister she's a--

339
00:25:35,002 --> 00:25:37,169
tell her to lighten up a bit.

340
00:25:37,171 --> 00:25:39,873
And for when you
actually feel like it--

341
00:26:16,343 --> 00:26:17,342
Hey.

342
00:26:17,344 --> 00:26:19,812
Mirra, hey, you came.

343
00:26:19,814 --> 00:26:21,647
Yeah, thank you for inviting me.

344
00:26:21,649 --> 00:26:23,649
Of course, come over here.

345
00:26:23,651 --> 00:26:24,216
Scarlett, Mirra.

346
00:26:24,218 --> 00:26:25,584
Mirra, Scarlett.

347
00:26:30,191 --> 00:26:31,824
We were just doing a
tarot card reading.

348
00:26:31,826 --> 00:26:32,691
We do it every week.

349
00:26:32,693 --> 00:26:34,893
It's like therapy.

350
00:26:34,895 --> 00:26:37,396
Have you ever done it?

351
00:26:37,398 --> 00:26:38,230
No.

352
00:26:38,232 --> 00:26:39,765
Oh my God, you would love it.

353
00:26:39,767 --> 00:26:43,435
Yeah, yeah, I don't really
believe and that kind of stuff.

354
00:26:43,437 --> 00:26:44,670
It's really good for you.

355
00:26:44,672 --> 00:26:47,005
Yeah, you should try it.

356
00:26:47,007 --> 00:26:48,175
It's OK.

357
00:26:51,011 --> 00:26:52,211
After dinner maybe.

358
00:26:52,213 --> 00:26:55,013
Yeah, yeah, maybe.

359
00:26:55,015 --> 00:26:56,882
Yeah, come on.

360
00:26:56,884 --> 00:26:58,518
This looks really, really good.

361
00:26:58,520 --> 00:26:59,852
Oh my God.

362
00:26:59,854 --> 00:27:01,220
Wow, I heard you
caught the fish.

363
00:30:13,981 --> 00:30:14,580
Hello.

364
00:30:14,582 --> 00:30:15,213
Hey.

365
00:30:15,215 --> 00:30:16,081
Hey.

366
00:30:16,083 --> 00:30:17,550
What are you doing here?

367
00:30:17,552 --> 00:30:19,552
You know, I'm just
working, sweaty, dirty.

368
00:30:19,554 --> 00:30:20,986
What are you doing?

369
00:30:20,988 --> 00:30:22,988
Just walking.

370
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:26,559
Yeah, are you free right now?

371
00:30:26,561 --> 00:30:29,227
Do you want to go for a ride?

372
00:30:29,229 --> 00:30:30,095
Where?

373
00:30:30,097 --> 00:30:31,263
Just around the fields.

374
00:30:31,265 --> 00:30:34,399
You know, I can
show you some stuff.

375
00:30:34,401 --> 00:30:37,737
I grew up here so--

376
00:30:37,739 --> 00:30:40,272
I know.

377
00:30:40,274 --> 00:30:41,973
I'm OK.

378
00:30:41,975 --> 00:30:44,443
Come on, you should get to
know it before you let it go.

379
00:30:44,445 --> 00:30:47,179
I do know it.

380
00:30:47,181 --> 00:30:48,316
You sure?

381
00:30:51,285 --> 00:30:52,184
You know what?

382
00:30:52,186 --> 00:30:57,356
Yeah, yeah, let's go.

383
00:30:57,358 --> 00:30:59,291
Yeah, I want to go.

384
00:30:59,293 --> 00:31:00,092
You OK?

385
00:31:00,094 --> 00:31:00,859
Yeah, I'm fine.

386
00:31:00,861 --> 00:31:01,993
I want to go.

387
00:31:01,995 --> 00:31:02,628
OK.

388
00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:03,195
Show me.

389
00:31:03,197 --> 00:31:03,796
OK, let's go.

390
00:31:03,798 --> 00:31:04,363
OK.

391
00:31:53,313 --> 00:31:54,647
You're fine?

392
00:31:54,649 --> 00:31:59,585
Yeah, I'm really, really
happy I came out here.

393
00:31:59,587 --> 00:32:02,421
You know, it was a group
of women from Massachusetts

394
00:32:02,423 --> 00:32:04,055
who first settled this land.

395
00:32:04,057 --> 00:32:05,323
Really?

396
00:32:05,325 --> 00:32:08,093
Yeah, it was women
before your family.

397
00:32:08,095 --> 00:32:09,363
They owned it.

398
00:32:13,668 --> 00:32:15,400
Do you want to do bonfire later?

399
00:32:15,402 --> 00:32:18,003
Yeah, yeah, definitely.

400
00:32:18,005 --> 00:32:18,671
Awesome.

401
00:32:18,673 --> 00:32:19,404
That'll be awesome.

402
00:33:13,828 --> 00:33:15,595
So how's life in the city?

403
00:33:18,999 --> 00:33:21,099
It's busy.

404
00:33:21,101 --> 00:33:22,602
Do you like to be busy?

405
00:33:22,604 --> 00:33:25,403
I like the structure.

406
00:33:25,405 --> 00:33:27,241
What kind of structure?

407
00:33:29,243 --> 00:33:31,076
Probably financial.

408
00:33:31,078 --> 00:33:33,913
So money?

409
00:33:33,915 --> 00:33:35,247
You like money.

410
00:33:35,249 --> 00:33:40,686
Oh, I wouldn't say I like money,
but I appreciate its value.

411
00:33:40,688 --> 00:33:43,357
Have you ever tried to
swim naked in the ocean?

412
00:33:46,493 --> 00:33:47,594
What?

413
00:33:50,364 --> 00:33:51,196
I don't know.

414
00:33:51,198 --> 00:33:52,599
Have you?

415
00:34:04,111 --> 00:34:05,443
Hi, you've reached Mirra.

416
00:34:05,445 --> 00:34:07,379
I can't come to the phone
right now but please leave--

417
00:34:30,337 --> 00:34:32,638
Well, look who it is.

418
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:33,639
I knew you'd come.

419
00:34:33,641 --> 00:34:34,472
I knew it.

420
00:34:34,474 --> 00:34:36,474
I fucking knew it.

421
00:34:36,476 --> 00:34:37,142
I knew it.

422
00:34:37,144 --> 00:34:38,076
Get in here.

423
00:34:38,078 --> 00:34:39,011
Get in here.

424
00:34:39,013 --> 00:34:41,814
Man, come in.

425
00:34:41,816 --> 00:34:44,016
You ever try LSD?

426
00:34:44,018 --> 00:34:51,256
No, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, I don't do that.

427
00:34:51,258 --> 00:34:53,926
Do what?

428
00:34:53,928 --> 00:34:55,029
Drugs.

429
00:34:58,332 --> 00:35:07,205
You know when you swim in the
ocean, the sounds get muffled.

430
00:35:07,207 --> 00:35:09,775
The colors brighten.

431
00:35:09,777 --> 00:35:12,279
You feel like you
belong somewhere.

432
00:35:14,381 --> 00:35:15,682
It's like that.

433
00:35:17,552 --> 00:35:19,520
It's like dreaming in real life.

434
00:35:23,223 --> 00:35:25,558
I mean, there's only
a little on these.

435
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:32,533
So you just suck on them for
a little bit and feel lighter.

436
00:35:35,703 --> 00:35:36,969
No pressure.

437
00:35:36,971 --> 00:35:38,072
No pressure.

438
00:35:46,446 --> 00:35:49,381
Let's go, buddy.

439
00:35:49,383 --> 00:35:50,484
All right.

440
00:35:57,725 --> 00:36:00,394
All right, all right, all right.

441
00:36:03,665 --> 00:36:07,635
One for you, and one for me.

442
00:36:12,472 --> 00:36:15,109
All right, cheers.

443
00:36:18,846 --> 00:36:21,248
Fuck, oh, it's good.

444
00:36:23,084 --> 00:36:26,184
Dude, it's just a
fucking shot, you pussy.

445
00:36:26,186 --> 00:36:26,752
Sugar.

446
00:36:40,635 --> 00:36:41,801
This is great.

447
00:36:44,438 --> 00:36:46,939
You like it?

448
00:36:46,941 --> 00:36:51,110
This is really, really great.

449
00:36:51,112 --> 00:36:52,213
Good.

450
00:36:56,349 --> 00:36:58,952
Why do I always feel this way?

451
00:37:01,556 --> 00:37:06,324
It's not your fault.

452
00:37:06,326 --> 00:37:10,162
It's because I hate myself.

453
00:37:10,164 --> 00:37:11,298
Yeah.

454
00:37:13,801 --> 00:37:16,203
I hate who I am.

455
00:37:19,239 --> 00:37:20,708
Who are you?

456
00:37:24,145 --> 00:37:30,315
Skin, my body.

457
00:37:30,317 --> 00:37:31,719
That's not you.

458
00:37:36,657 --> 00:37:37,725
I'm scared.

459
00:37:40,661 --> 00:37:43,162
Scared of being alone.

460
00:37:43,164 --> 00:37:44,331
You're not.

461
00:37:46,834 --> 00:37:53,038
But I-- I am scared
of being alone.

462
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,006
Yeah.

463
00:37:54,008 --> 00:37:57,510
To not have anyone
to take care of.

464
00:37:57,512 --> 00:37:58,844
Yeah.

465
00:37:58,846 --> 00:38:00,246
Or to take care of me.

466
00:38:00,248 --> 00:38:01,348
Yeah.

467
00:38:10,091 --> 00:38:12,792
I'm alone.

468
00:38:12,794 --> 00:38:16,562
No, you're not.

469
00:38:16,564 --> 00:38:17,362
I'm alone.

470
00:38:17,364 --> 00:38:18,296
No, you're not.

471
00:38:18,298 --> 00:38:21,901
Yes, I-- I don't
want to be alone.

472
00:38:21,903 --> 00:38:22,768
You're not alone.

473
00:38:22,770 --> 00:38:24,069
You're here with us.

474
00:38:24,071 --> 00:38:25,538
It's OK.

475
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:26,572
I don't want to be alone.

476
00:38:26,574 --> 00:38:27,773
It's OK.

477
00:38:27,775 --> 00:38:30,810
If you have one
thing to care about--

478
00:38:30,812 --> 00:38:32,313
it's all you need.

479
00:38:36,217 --> 00:38:41,253
Shh, it's OK, just breathe, OK?

480
00:38:48,830 --> 00:38:51,797
Breathe.

481
00:38:51,799 --> 00:38:52,899
Breathe.

482
00:38:56,403 --> 00:38:59,337
Breathe.

483
00:38:59,339 --> 00:39:00,441
Breathe.

484
00:39:02,743 --> 00:39:03,811
Breathe.

485
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,414
Breathe.

486
00:39:09,650 --> 00:39:10,751
Breathe.

487
00:39:15,623 --> 00:39:19,859
Nathan, Nathan, get up.

488
00:39:38,478 --> 00:39:39,613
Nathan.

489
00:39:44,652 --> 00:39:45,786
Nathan?

490
00:40:20,755 --> 00:40:22,755
Hey, babe.

491
00:40:22,757 --> 00:40:24,425
What's up?

492
00:40:27,061 --> 00:40:30,529
I didn't know who
else to talk to.

493
00:40:30,531 --> 00:40:31,697
What about your brother?

494
00:40:31,699 --> 00:40:33,167
I can't talk to him.

495
00:40:37,505 --> 00:40:38,672
He's an addict.

496
00:40:40,708 --> 00:40:47,246
He has struggled with drugs for
a long time, since he was 14.

497
00:40:47,248 --> 00:40:51,517
All different kinds, and
God, it made me hate him.

498
00:40:51,519 --> 00:40:53,953
But it's just-- it's
not his fault, right?

499
00:40:53,955 --> 00:40:56,221
It's a disease,
and I've just been

500
00:40:56,223 --> 00:40:59,925
trying to get him clean for
as long as I can remember.

501
00:40:59,927 --> 00:41:02,061
And it's just--

502
00:41:02,063 --> 00:41:04,363
God, I'm exhausted.

503
00:41:04,365 --> 00:41:04,930
No, I'm--

504
00:45:12,046 --> 00:45:14,313
Mirra, what the fuck?

505
00:45:14,315 --> 00:45:17,684
I need-- I need to
talk to you, OK?

506
00:45:17,686 --> 00:45:20,152
No, no, in person.

507
00:45:20,154 --> 00:45:21,855
Well, where on the farm?

508
00:46:09,837 --> 00:46:10,904
Shit.

509
00:46:14,842 --> 00:46:15,374
Hey.

510
00:46:15,376 --> 00:46:16,542
I didn't mean--

511
00:46:16,544 --> 00:46:17,677
Wait.

512
00:46:17,679 --> 00:46:18,377
I'm sorry.

513
00:46:18,379 --> 00:46:24,850
Nathan, sorry for what?

514
00:46:24,852 --> 00:46:25,851
Never mind.

515
00:46:25,853 --> 00:46:27,553
Wait.

516
00:46:27,555 --> 00:46:28,887
What?

517
00:46:28,889 --> 00:46:31,624
Where you been?

518
00:46:31,626 --> 00:46:32,625
Why?

519
00:46:32,627 --> 00:46:35,093
I've been looking for you.

520
00:46:35,095 --> 00:46:36,696
Why have you been
looking for me?

521
00:46:36,698 --> 00:46:38,063
I want to show you something.

522
00:46:38,065 --> 00:46:38,797
Come on.

523
00:46:38,799 --> 00:46:39,632
Show me what?

524
00:46:39,634 --> 00:46:40,198
Come on.

525
00:48:02,116 --> 00:48:03,115
What's up, man?

526
00:48:03,117 --> 00:48:06,451
Can I come in?

527
00:48:06,453 --> 00:48:08,521
Come forth, young man.

528
00:48:12,727 --> 00:48:14,025
Oh, shit.

529
00:48:14,027 --> 00:48:17,797
So-- so you don't
remember anything, really?

530
00:48:17,799 --> 00:48:18,330
No.

531
00:48:18,332 --> 00:48:19,297
Nothing at all?

532
00:48:19,299 --> 00:48:20,633
No.

533
00:48:20,635 --> 00:48:21,299
No.

534
00:48:21,301 --> 00:48:22,901
Holy shit, dude.

535
00:48:22,903 --> 00:48:23,836
I get it.

536
00:48:23,838 --> 00:48:24,704
Go hard, man.

537
00:48:24,706 --> 00:48:25,571
It's fine.

538
00:48:25,573 --> 00:48:26,873
Do you have any whiskey?

539
00:48:26,875 --> 00:48:27,372
Whiskey?

540
00:48:27,374 --> 00:48:29,007
Well, yes.

541
00:48:29,009 --> 00:48:30,475
Next to you.

542
00:48:30,477 --> 00:48:31,844
I missed you though.

543
00:48:31,846 --> 00:48:36,649
Yeah, so you were saying
something about my dad

544
00:48:36,651 --> 00:48:39,017
and what he used to
talk to you by the bar.

545
00:48:39,019 --> 00:48:40,653
Did he-- what did he say?

546
00:48:40,655 --> 00:48:43,388
Did he mention-- did
he ever mention that--

547
00:48:43,390 --> 00:48:46,826
the hot redhead from the farm,
the tall bitch and her sister.

548
00:48:46,828 --> 00:48:49,729
We talked about
those dykes, man.

549
00:48:49,731 --> 00:48:51,329
I don't fucking remember, OK?

550
00:48:51,331 --> 00:48:52,931
We--

551
00:48:52,933 --> 00:48:54,501
Jesus, you were gone.

552
00:48:56,838 --> 00:49:01,339
So are you into
conspiracy theories?

553
00:49:01,341 --> 00:49:03,576
No, why?

554
00:49:03,578 --> 00:49:06,679
You just kept talking about
going back to the land,

555
00:49:06,681 --> 00:49:09,549
and you know, fucking
visions and shit.

556
00:49:09,551 --> 00:49:10,449
Well, visions?

557
00:49:10,451 --> 00:49:11,884
Visions or nightmares?

558
00:49:11,886 --> 00:49:19,024
Dude, your dad would get
like religiously fucked up.

559
00:49:19,026 --> 00:49:22,027
I'd have to fucking carry
him home level fucked up.

560
00:49:22,029 --> 00:49:24,229
Come to think of it, you
kind of owe me for that.

561
00:49:24,231 --> 00:49:25,932
So, yeah, let me
fuck your sister.

562
00:49:25,934 --> 00:49:26,566
Very funny.

563
00:49:26,568 --> 00:49:28,568
Fuck off, please.

564
00:49:28,570 --> 00:49:29,702
What did he say about--

565
00:49:29,704 --> 00:49:31,203
what did he say
about the visions?

566
00:49:31,205 --> 00:49:32,538
What did he say
about the visions?

567
00:49:32,540 --> 00:49:35,808
Shit about your
family or something.

568
00:49:35,810 --> 00:49:37,275
Yeah?

569
00:49:37,277 --> 00:49:38,611
Yeah, man.

570
00:49:38,613 --> 00:49:40,111
Can you just spit it the
fuck out please, Greg.

571
00:49:40,113 --> 00:49:41,282
God damn.

572
00:49:43,083 --> 00:49:45,984
Listen, all I know is that
your dad's dad's dad did

573
00:49:45,986 --> 00:49:50,556
some shady shit, and as
for conspiracy theories,

574
00:49:50,558 --> 00:49:53,158
the land is cursed.

575
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:54,159
What do you mean cursed?

576
00:49:54,161 --> 00:49:55,962
Cursed how?

577
00:49:55,964 --> 00:49:57,262
Cursed how?

578
00:49:57,264 --> 00:49:58,932
Who gives a shit?

579
00:50:02,236 --> 00:50:03,101
They never forgot.

580
00:50:05,472 --> 00:50:09,074
He always used to
say that shit to me.

581
00:50:09,076 --> 00:50:10,342
They never forgot.

582
00:50:10,344 --> 00:50:12,845
They never forgot.

583
00:50:12,847 --> 00:50:15,316
It's kind of weird
when I think about it.

584
00:50:18,953 --> 00:50:20,321
They never forgot.

585
00:50:22,289 --> 00:50:25,190
Nathan, they never forgot.

586
00:50:48,115 --> 00:50:55,688
Mirra, can we talk?

587
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:02,028
I think we should
leave tomorrow.

588
00:51:02,030 --> 00:51:04,362
Hey, you know, we have
a complicated past--

589
00:51:04,364 --> 00:51:06,131
No, no, no, it's
not-- it's not that.

590
00:51:06,133 --> 00:51:11,236
It's not-- I'm not getting a
very good vibe off the farm

591
00:51:11,238 --> 00:51:12,170
workers.

592
00:51:12,172 --> 00:51:13,474
The farm workers?

593
00:51:16,376 --> 00:51:18,376
What about her?

594
00:51:18,378 --> 00:51:21,313
I don't trust her.

595
00:51:21,315 --> 00:51:24,016
Why not?

596
00:51:24,018 --> 00:51:25,483
I think you know.

597
00:51:25,485 --> 00:51:28,654
No, no, I don't.

598
00:51:28,656 --> 00:51:30,288
Well, did you know that--

599
00:51:30,290 --> 00:51:32,858
did you know that their
ancestors owned the land way

600
00:51:32,860 --> 00:51:34,192
back in the 1600s before us?

601
00:51:34,194 --> 00:51:35,728
Yes, yes, I do.

602
00:51:35,730 --> 00:51:36,996
You don't think that's a little
creepy or a little weird?

603
00:51:36,998 --> 00:51:38,396
Do you hear yourself right now?

604
00:51:38,398 --> 00:51:40,165
They clearly want
something from us.

605
00:51:40,167 --> 00:51:42,668
They want something
from us, and Greg--

606
00:51:42,670 --> 00:51:43,502
Greg also--

607
00:51:43,504 --> 00:51:44,269
Greg, Greg, Greg.

608
00:51:44,271 --> 00:51:45,103
Wow, Greg?

609
00:51:45,105 --> 00:51:46,505
It doesn't matter.

610
00:51:46,507 --> 00:51:48,674
It doesn't matter actually, but
they fucked with dad's head.

611
00:51:48,676 --> 00:51:50,375
They fucked with
dad's head, and I

612
00:51:50,377 --> 00:51:51,544
think they might
have had something

613
00:51:51,546 --> 00:51:52,678
to do with dad's
death, and I'm not--

614
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:53,546
I'm not--

615
00:51:53,548 --> 00:51:54,680
You mean dad's suicide.

616
00:51:54,682 --> 00:51:56,515
Dad-- dad-- you
said dad's death.

617
00:51:56,517 --> 00:51:57,850
Dad committed suicide.

618
00:51:57,852 --> 00:51:59,184
He killed himself.

619
00:51:59,186 --> 00:52:05,925
Yeah, yeah, I know, I
know, I know, I know.

620
00:52:05,927 --> 00:52:07,026
OK.

621
00:52:07,028 --> 00:52:08,395
OK, OK.

622
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:19,404
Nate, Nathan, what's that?

623
00:52:19,406 --> 00:52:20,541
What's that?

624
00:52:26,547 --> 00:52:27,713
That's not mine.

625
00:52:27,715 --> 00:52:28,446
It's not yours.

626
00:52:28,448 --> 00:52:29,949
It's not mine.

627
00:52:29,951 --> 00:52:31,651
It's not-- I didn't
fucking touch that.

628
00:52:31,653 --> 00:52:32,952
You just threw that at me.

629
00:52:32,954 --> 00:52:34,720
I fucking-- I
haven't touched that.

630
00:52:34,722 --> 00:52:35,721
I didn't touch that.

631
00:52:35,723 --> 00:52:36,555
What's funny?

632
00:52:36,557 --> 00:52:37,422
What's funny?

633
00:52:37,424 --> 00:52:38,658
Why are you laughing?

634
00:52:38,660 --> 00:52:40,993
Honestly, because,
Nate, why the hell not?

635
00:52:40,995 --> 00:52:43,129
You don't think this is funny?

636
00:52:43,131 --> 00:52:44,496
This is funny.

637
00:52:44,498 --> 00:52:46,231
You just hold the phone on your
little, mini, fucking break

638
00:52:46,233 --> 00:52:46,899
down.

639
00:52:46,901 --> 00:52:47,465
My mini breakdown?

640
00:52:47,467 --> 00:52:48,067
Yes.

641
00:52:48,069 --> 00:52:48,834
OK.

642
00:52:48,836 --> 00:52:49,602
Yes, your mini break down.

643
00:52:49,604 --> 00:52:50,402
You know what?

644
00:52:50,404 --> 00:52:51,403
Fuck you, OK?

645
00:52:51,405 --> 00:52:53,407
You're not listening to me.

646
00:52:58,980 --> 00:53:01,248
You're not listening to me.

647
00:53:03,518 --> 00:53:06,919
I'm not selling the farm.

648
00:53:06,921 --> 00:53:08,854
What?

649
00:53:08,856 --> 00:53:11,423
I'm going to keep this farm,
and I'm going to farm it.

650
00:53:11,425 --> 00:53:13,626
I already spoke to a lawyer.

651
00:53:13,628 --> 00:53:14,660
How?

652
00:53:14,662 --> 00:53:16,095
No, well, you can't.

653
00:53:16,097 --> 00:53:16,595
You can't.

654
00:53:16,597 --> 00:53:17,495
Yes, I can.

655
00:53:17,497 --> 00:53:18,798
You want to know why?

656
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:20,833
Because dad left me in
charge of the trust.

657
00:53:20,835 --> 00:53:22,434
What is that-- what
are you saying?

658
00:53:22,436 --> 00:53:23,268
What does that mean?

659
00:53:23,270 --> 00:53:23,969
What are you saying?

660
00:53:23,971 --> 00:53:25,370
What are you saying--

661
00:53:25,372 --> 00:53:27,272
It means that I get to do
whatever I want with it.

662
00:53:27,274 --> 00:53:28,206
I can farm it.

663
00:53:28,208 --> 00:53:30,275
I can keep it, or
I could sell it.

664
00:53:30,277 --> 00:53:30,943
You can't do that.

665
00:53:30,945 --> 00:53:31,777
You know what, Nate?

666
00:53:31,779 --> 00:53:32,678
You know what?

667
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:34,046
I will pay your rent.

668
00:53:34,048 --> 00:53:36,949
I will pay your rent
for your half, OK?

669
00:53:36,951 --> 00:53:40,119
I will do that, OK?

670
00:59:10,885 --> 00:59:13,620
Nathan, Nathan.

671
00:59:19,126 --> 00:59:20,294
Where are you?

672
00:59:22,563 --> 00:59:23,328
Stop it.

673
01:00:18,853 --> 01:00:20,953
Oh, thank God.

674
01:00:20,955 --> 01:00:22,888
Hey, we got to go.

675
01:00:22,890 --> 01:00:23,889
Where are we going?

676
01:00:23,891 --> 01:00:25,023
Just get your shit, please.

677
01:00:25,025 --> 01:00:26,559
Now, now.

678
01:00:26,561 --> 01:00:27,693
Get your shit.

679
01:00:27,695 --> 01:00:29,027
I have a meeting with
the lawyer tomorrow.

680
01:00:29,029 --> 01:00:29,862
I don't care about
the lawyer, man.

681
01:00:29,864 --> 01:00:30,863
I don't care.

682
01:00:30,865 --> 01:00:31,864
They're in my fucking head.

683
01:00:31,866 --> 01:00:33,365
They're in my head.

684
01:00:33,367 --> 01:00:35,767
They want something from me,
and I don't know what it is.

685
01:00:35,769 --> 01:00:36,735
They fucked with dad.

686
01:00:36,737 --> 01:00:37,769
They fucked with dad.

687
01:00:37,771 --> 01:00:38,770
Now, they're fucking with me.

688
01:00:38,772 --> 01:00:39,572
Dad knew.

689
01:00:39,574 --> 01:00:40,139
Dad knew.

690
01:00:40,141 --> 01:00:41,373
This is dad's.

691
01:00:41,375 --> 01:00:42,542
Look, look, look,
and Greg new too.

692
01:00:42,544 --> 01:00:43,610
Greg new too.

693
01:00:43,612 --> 01:00:44,977
You don't think it's
fucking weird, Mirra.

694
01:00:44,979 --> 01:00:46,278
He does all this
shit now he's gone.

695
01:00:46,280 --> 01:00:48,380
Fucking the revenge,
the revenge on us Mirra.

696
01:00:48,382 --> 01:00:50,716
Our family, our family, our
family slaughtered them.

697
01:00:50,718 --> 01:00:53,819
Their whole-- their whole coven
or some shit that I don't know.

698
01:00:53,821 --> 01:00:54,720
I don't know.

699
01:00:54,722 --> 01:00:55,821
They want something.

700
01:00:55,823 --> 01:00:57,289
I think they're doing
something to you too.

701
01:00:57,291 --> 01:00:58,724
I think they're doing
something to you.

702
01:00:58,726 --> 01:01:01,293
You'd be their third piece
or something like that.

703
01:01:01,295 --> 01:01:02,261
Like a triangle.

704
01:01:02,263 --> 01:01:03,795
Yes, like a triangle.

705
01:01:03,797 --> 01:01:06,932
Look, look, I know it sounds
crazy, but look, look, look.

706
01:01:06,934 --> 01:01:08,300
They put it they
put it on me too.

707
01:01:08,302 --> 01:01:11,737
They put it-- what the fuck?

708
01:01:11,739 --> 01:01:13,438
Hey, you OK, Nate?

709
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:14,607
You don't look so good.

710
01:01:14,609 --> 01:01:15,274
Shut the fuck up.

711
01:01:15,276 --> 01:01:16,775
Nathan, it's OK.

712
01:01:16,777 --> 01:01:17,911
Hi.

713
01:01:20,281 --> 01:01:21,747
Who the fuck are you?

714
01:01:21,749 --> 01:01:22,515
This is my sister.

715
01:01:22,517 --> 01:01:23,148
You met.

716
01:01:23,150 --> 01:01:24,116
I don't know you.

717
01:01:24,118 --> 01:01:24,917
I know what you're doing.

718
01:01:24,919 --> 01:01:25,784
Nathan, stop it.

719
01:01:25,786 --> 01:01:26,586
Are you in her head too?

720
01:01:26,588 --> 01:01:27,419
Don't worry, OK?

721
01:01:27,421 --> 01:01:29,589
Don't worry about what, bitch?

722
01:01:29,591 --> 01:01:32,691
Stop it.

723
01:01:32,693 --> 01:01:33,825
Don't worry about what?

724
01:01:33,827 --> 01:01:35,160
Mirra, don't worry about what?

725
01:01:35,162 --> 01:01:36,695
I know, I know, I--

726
01:01:36,697 --> 01:01:37,262
I fucked--

727
01:01:37,264 --> 01:01:38,598
Nathan, stop it.

728
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:39,131
I know--

729
01:01:39,133 --> 01:01:39,865
Stop it, Nathan.

730
01:01:39,867 --> 01:01:40,832
Please, please.

731
01:01:40,834 --> 01:01:42,334
I'm your brother, please.

732
01:01:42,336 --> 01:01:43,970
I think we should go.

733
01:01:46,106 --> 01:01:47,439
What the fuck did you just say?

734
01:01:47,441 --> 01:01:49,107
What the fuck did you just say?

735
01:01:49,109 --> 01:01:50,543
I said I think we should go.

736
01:01:50,545 --> 01:01:53,114
Shut the fuck up, you cunt.

737
01:02:01,388 --> 01:02:04,189
I know what you are.

738
01:02:04,191 --> 01:02:05,324
I-- I know.

739
01:03:34,214 --> 01:03:45,257
Mirra, Mirra, Mirra, Mirra.

740
01:03:45,259 --> 01:03:46,493
I'm here.

741
01:03:54,068 --> 01:03:55,769
Where is she?

742
01:04:03,243 --> 01:04:04,511
It's me, Nate.

743
01:04:06,648 --> 01:04:10,182
No, no, you're not Mirra.

744
01:04:10,184 --> 01:04:11,418
It's OK.

745
01:04:13,487 --> 01:04:14,453
What did you do to her?

746
01:04:14,455 --> 01:04:15,588
What did you do with her?

747
01:04:15,590 --> 01:04:17,422
What did you do with her?

748
01:04:17,424 --> 01:04:19,193
It's going to be OK.

749
01:04:24,098 --> 01:04:25,932
I've got to end it.

750
01:04:28,770 --> 01:04:29,836
What?

751
01:04:29,838 --> 01:04:33,105
You made me!

752
01:04:33,107 --> 01:04:34,272
Nathan.

753
01:04:34,274 --> 01:04:36,108
No, stop.

754
01:04:36,110 --> 01:04:37,309
Stop it.

755
01:04:37,311 --> 01:04:38,611
Stop it.

756
01:04:38,613 --> 01:04:41,113
You're all the same.

757
01:04:41,115 --> 01:04:43,816
You tied us up.

758
01:04:43,818 --> 01:04:44,983
You burned us.

759
01:04:44,985 --> 01:04:47,285
You drowned us.

760
01:04:47,287 --> 01:04:48,721
No, I didn't.

761
01:04:48,723 --> 01:04:49,856
I didn't.

762
01:04:49,858 --> 01:04:51,292
You lost control.

763
01:04:53,494 --> 01:04:54,527
Where's Mirra?

764
01:04:54,529 --> 01:04:55,996
Where's Mirra?

765
01:04:58,132 --> 01:04:58,897
I'm sorry.

766
01:04:58,899 --> 01:04:59,898
Never forgot.

767
01:04:59,900 --> 01:05:01,801
Mirra.

768
01:05:01,803 --> 01:05:03,301
Mirra.

769
01:05:03,303 --> 01:05:04,403
We never forgot.

770
01:05:04,405 --> 01:05:05,805
We never forgot.

771
01:05:05,807 --> 01:05:06,972
We never forgot.

772
01:05:06,974 --> 01:05:07,840
Stop it!

773
01:05:07,842 --> 01:05:08,875
Please, shut up!

774
01:05:08,877 --> 01:05:10,510
Shut up!

775
01:05:10,512 --> 01:05:11,811
We never forgot.

776
01:05:11,813 --> 01:05:12,812
We never forgot.

777
01:05:12,814 --> 01:05:13,880
I'm sorry.

778
01:05:13,882 --> 01:05:16,314
I'm sorry.

779
01:05:16,316 --> 01:05:19,217
No, please, shut up.

780
01:05:19,219 --> 01:05:20,352
Mirra.

781
01:05:20,354 --> 01:05:22,421
We never forgot.

782
01:05:37,204 --> 01:05:38,339
Sorry.

783
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:41,375
I'm sorry.

784
01:05:45,412 --> 01:05:46,947
I'm sorry.

785
01:05:50,585 --> 01:05:57,024
No, no, no, no, no.

786
01:06:04,097 --> 01:06:05,598
No, please.

787
01:06:28,222 --> 01:06:29,390
Get up.
