1
00:00:08,488 --> 00:00:11,355
And now,
the reading of the prophecy.

2
00:00:11,424 --> 00:00:13,790
"It should come to pass,

3
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:18,058
at the close of the first millennium,
at the rise of the Halloween moon,

4
00:00:18,131 --> 00:00:22,033
a Cromwell of great power
will embrace the Gift. "

5
00:00:22,102 --> 00:00:24,570
Marnie Piper is the Cromwell
of the prophecy,

6
00:00:24,637 --> 00:00:26,332
the one that we have waited for.

7
00:00:38,284 --> 00:00:40,775
Keep. Give away.

8
00:00:40,854 --> 00:00:43,379
Keep it. Give away.

9
00:00:43,456 --> 00:00:45,617
Mmm... Keep it.

10
00:00:46,593 --> 00:00:47,958
Give away.

11
00:00:48,027 --> 00:00:49,927
Keep it.

12
00:00:49,996 --> 00:00:51,930
- Marnie.
- Hey, Mom.

13
00:00:51,998 --> 00:00:53,761
What is going on in here?

14
00:00:53,833 --> 00:00:57,132
I'm making a new start, I'm
cleaning high school out of my closet.

15
00:00:58,271 --> 00:01:00,535
Well, actually,
it's cleaning itself out,

16
00:01:00,607 --> 00:01:02,507
I'm just helping it make decisions.

17
00:01:04,444 --> 00:01:06,469
- Did I buy that dress?
- I bought that.

18
00:01:06,546 --> 00:01:08,309
Oh. Love it.

19
00:01:15,388 --> 00:01:17,288
Mother, I just want to speak to her.

20
00:01:17,357 --> 00:01:19,325
Well, where is she?

21
00:01:19,392 --> 00:01:21,326
Tell her I just want to talk to her.

22
00:01:21,394 --> 00:01:24,591
- Mom, are you talking to soup again?
- Absolutely not. Ow.

23
00:01:25,865 --> 00:01:28,459
- There's room for that in the garage.
- Cool.

24
00:01:28,535 --> 00:01:30,264
- Garage.
- Marnie!

25
00:01:31,404 --> 00:01:33,929
- What?
- Stop with the magic.

26
00:01:34,007 --> 00:01:35,702
You said no magic around Sophie.

27
00:01:35,775 --> 00:01:37,640
- Sophie's gone.
- Don't remind me.

28
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:41,077
Traipsing around another dimension,
learning magic, doing spells.

29
00:01:41,147 --> 00:01:44,412
- She's too young.
- Relax. She's with Grandma Aggie.

30
00:01:44,484 --> 00:01:47,180
Oh. And that's supposed
to make me feel better.

31
00:01:47,253 --> 00:01:50,654
Mom, the soup.

32
00:01:50,723 --> 00:01:53,590
- Oh, OK. Who wants soup?
- Not me.

33
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:56,925
Well, we'll just let it simmer.

34
00:01:56,996 --> 00:02:01,126
Gwen, dear.
Yoo-hoo! Wake up!

35
00:02:02,835 --> 00:02:06,168
Marnie, dear,
I thought the call was dropped.

36
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:08,707
- We're right here, Grandma.
- Hello, Mother.

37
00:02:08,775 --> 00:02:13,678
Gwen, darling, I want to go over
one more thing before we lose contact.

38
00:02:13,746 --> 00:02:17,204
Lose contact? Who's losing contact?
Why are we losing contact?

39
00:02:17,283 --> 00:02:21,014
Well, Sophie's training
is progressing beautifully.

40
00:02:21,087 --> 00:02:26,616
But her inter-dimensional time travel
needs a lot of work.

41
00:02:26,693 --> 00:02:29,526
- Must run in the family.
- Her time travel messes up.

42
00:02:29,596 --> 00:02:31,621
Mother, you're fading.

43
00:02:31,698 --> 00:02:34,258
You won't be able
to contact me.

44
00:02:34,334 --> 00:02:38,031
I'll be in touch as soon as I can.
Oh, Marnie.

45
00:02:38,104 --> 00:02:40,038
Congratulations.

46
00:02:41,207 --> 00:02:42,640
Bye, Grandma!

47
00:02:42,709 --> 00:02:45,735
Man, the soup pot coverage
in this area stinks.

48
00:02:45,812 --> 00:02:49,942
Congratulations on...?

49
00:02:50,016 --> 00:02:51,244
What?

50
00:02:51,317 --> 00:02:56,016
I've been accepted to Witch University.
I'm going to college in Halloweentown.

51
00:02:56,089 --> 00:02:58,455
No. Marnie.

52
00:02:58,524 --> 00:03:00,389
We discussed this.

53
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:03,293
You're going to community college
for two years,

54
00:03:03,363 --> 00:03:06,457
- and then to State.
- Exactly what everybody here does.

55
00:03:06,532 --> 00:03:09,330
I'm not spending another four years
with the same people.

56
00:03:09,402 --> 00:03:11,393
You're not gonna spend it with witches.

57
00:03:11,471 --> 00:03:14,565
What's wrong with being a witch?
I'm a witch, you're a witch.

58
00:03:14,641 --> 00:03:18,737
- I just want college to be different.
- College here will be different.

59
00:03:18,811 --> 00:03:22,178
How? I'll still have to hide my magic
because of a few people.

60
00:03:22,248 --> 00:03:24,978
I want to use it.
I have powers nobody else has.

61
00:03:25,051 --> 00:03:28,851
Powers I haven't even discovered yet.
I want to find out who I am.

62
00:03:28,921 --> 00:03:32,049
With all that power
comes responsibility, Marnie.

63
00:03:32,125 --> 00:03:34,389
You stole that from Spider-Man.

64
00:03:35,395 --> 00:03:37,192
Listen to me, Marnie.

65
00:03:37,263 --> 00:03:41,927
The world is...
Not all magic is good, OK?

66
00:03:42,001 --> 00:03:44,697
There are some very bad witches
in Halloweentown.

67
00:03:44,771 --> 00:03:48,935
Mom, I know you want to keep me safe,
but I'm 18 now.

68
00:03:49,008 --> 00:03:51,476
You can't control me anymore.
I'm going to Witch U.

69
00:03:51,544 --> 00:03:55,241
- Well, I won't pay for it.
- You won't have to.

70
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:58,710
Hello, Marnie.

71
00:03:58,785 --> 00:04:00,753
My name is Dr. Luxana Goodwyn,

72
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:03,220
and I'm the chancellor
of Witch University.

73
00:04:03,289 --> 00:04:06,281
On behalf of the entire faculty,

74
00:04:06,359 --> 00:04:09,920
I want to extend to you
a full scholarship.

75
00:04:09,996 --> 00:04:13,659
We would be proud to have a Cromwell
at Witch University.

76
00:04:15,902 --> 00:04:19,303
I can't believe you would apply
without even asking me.

77
00:04:19,372 --> 00:04:21,670
I knew you'd never approve.

78
00:04:48,267 --> 00:04:50,098
Whoo-hoo!

79
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:55,498
I don't think she trusts you.

80
00:04:56,142 --> 00:04:59,009
I can go to college by myself.
Everyone else does.

81
00:04:59,078 --> 00:05:01,239
Can't you make these bags grow legs?

82
00:05:01,314 --> 00:05:02,679
Absolutely.

83
00:05:05,885 --> 00:05:07,409
That's not what I meant.

84
00:05:17,397 --> 00:05:19,160
Wait!

85
00:05:22,201 --> 00:05:24,863
So... do you have everything?

86
00:05:24,937 --> 00:05:26,336
I think so.

87
00:05:26,406 --> 00:05:28,670
I wanted to give you this.

88
00:05:31,677 --> 00:05:33,508
It's a personal witch's glass.

89
00:05:33,579 --> 00:05:37,174
It only calls home.
I mean, if you need anything.

90
00:05:38,151 --> 00:05:40,449
- Mom.
- Come here.

91
00:05:42,555 --> 00:05:43,886
Come here, sweetie.

92
00:05:46,459 --> 00:05:49,292
OK. You gotta get going now. Bye.

93
00:05:56,035 --> 00:05:59,027
I can't believe I'm really going
to Witch University.

94
00:05:59,105 --> 00:06:01,232
I wonder how I'll be transported there.

95
00:06:01,307 --> 00:06:04,936
Maybe they'll send a train of black
carriages driven by headless horsemen.

96
00:06:05,011 --> 00:06:09,107
Maybe a flotilla of Spanish galleons
to carry us across a misty lake.

97
00:06:22,061 --> 00:06:24,894
Or, maybe they'll just send Benny.

98
00:06:24,964 --> 00:06:26,693
Hey, kids, welcome back.

99
00:06:26,766 --> 00:06:29,530
- Hey, Benny.
- We're not kids anymore, Benny.

100
00:06:29,602 --> 00:06:32,537
Sister, to me everyone's a kid.

101
00:06:32,605 --> 00:06:34,539
What's that all about?

102
00:06:34,607 --> 00:06:37,371
Millennium anniversary
of Halloweentown.

103
00:06:37,443 --> 00:06:41,743
There's gonna be a celebration
up at the castle on Halloween night.

104
00:06:41,814 --> 00:06:43,042
Big shindig.

105
00:06:43,115 --> 00:06:45,709
This is the perfect time
to go to Witch University.

106
00:06:45,785 --> 00:06:47,685
Yeah, perfect.

107
00:06:54,594 --> 00:06:57,893
OK, kids, why did the skeleton
stop for barbeque?

108
00:06:57,964 --> 00:07:00,831
- Why?
- He needed some spare ribs!

109
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:04,427
Get it? What did the skeleton say
when he jumped on his motorcycle?

110
00:07:04,504 --> 00:07:06,404
"Bone to be wild. "

111
00:07:09,242 --> 00:07:13,542
- Hey, it's the university.
- Ah, ain't she beautiful?

112
00:07:14,547 --> 00:07:16,538
OK, that's pretty cool.

113
00:07:23,389 --> 00:07:26,153
This street is really "marrow. "

114
00:07:26,225 --> 00:07:27,783
Get it?

115
00:07:39,772 --> 00:07:42,639
Posters to be scratch and sniff.

116
00:07:42,708 --> 00:07:45,871
It's exactly the way
I imagined it would be.

117
00:07:45,945 --> 00:07:49,005
Exciting and ancient and magical.

118
00:07:50,082 --> 00:07:52,277
Enjoy your stay in Halloweentown.

119
00:07:52,351 --> 00:07:54,819
Oh, yeah.

120
00:07:56,589 --> 00:07:58,181
Hello, university!

121
00:07:59,258 --> 00:08:02,284
- Hello, Marnie.
- Dr. Goodwyn.

122
00:08:02,361 --> 00:08:04,591
Welcome to Witch University.

123
00:08:05,665 --> 00:08:08,065
- And you are?
- My porter.

124
00:08:08,668 --> 00:08:10,829
Her brother.
Hi, I'm Dylan.

125
00:08:10,903 --> 00:08:13,963
Dylan. Well, shall we?

126
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:17,999
How are you?

127
00:08:26,586 --> 00:08:29,521
So the young Cromwell is finally here.

128
00:08:31,624 --> 00:08:33,353
Alert the members of the Dominion.

129
00:08:33,426 --> 00:08:39,058
By Halloween night
the prophecy will be fulfilled.

130
00:08:58,517 --> 00:09:00,417
Sweet. My kind of people.

131
00:09:01,988 --> 00:09:05,185
You mean witches and warlocks
who look just like us?

132
00:09:05,257 --> 00:09:08,351
Or all those other weird creatures
unburdened by magic?

133
00:09:08,427 --> 00:09:10,588
I mean students, which you are not.

134
00:09:12,431 --> 00:09:13,989
Hey, is that Ethan?

135
00:09:15,301 --> 00:09:16,768
Hey, Ethan!

136
00:09:16,836 --> 00:09:19,862
Aren't you late for something,
like your own life?

137
00:09:21,607 --> 00:09:25,202
No kidding. But I promised Mom
I'd help you move in.

138
00:09:29,181 --> 00:09:31,115
- Show-off.
- Jealous.

139
00:09:31,183 --> 00:09:34,414
Your powers won't wait forever.
Use 'em before you lose 'em.

140
00:09:34,487 --> 00:09:37,581
- I prefer the power of my brain.
- Magic is so much more fun.

141
00:09:37,657 --> 00:09:39,625
Desino venefisio.

142
00:09:42,662 --> 00:09:44,892
Hey-ya!

143
00:09:45,531 --> 00:09:49,558
- Did he say "dusty venison?"
- He said desino venefisio.

144
00:09:49,635 --> 00:09:51,466
You speak Latin.

145
00:09:54,006 --> 00:09:56,736
Want to translate that
into an un-dead language?

146
00:09:56,809 --> 00:09:58,538
It means, "No magic allowed. "

147
00:09:59,578 --> 00:10:01,409
- In dorms?
- In the university.

148
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,505
- What?
- Didn't you read the handbook?

149
00:10:04,417 --> 00:10:07,215
Uh... Yeah, I read the handbook.

150
00:10:08,054 --> 00:10:09,453
Refresh my memory?

151
00:10:12,058 --> 00:10:16,495
It says, "Use of magic
on university grounds is prohibited.

152
00:10:16,562 --> 00:10:18,792
Use of magic to complete schoolwork

153
00:10:18,864 --> 00:10:21,594
will result in disciplinary action.

154
00:10:21,667 --> 00:10:25,967
Use of magic on or against any student,
staff member or professor

155
00:10:26,038 --> 00:10:28,973
will be grounds
for immediate dismissal. "

156
00:10:29,842 --> 00:10:31,833
Good to know.

157
00:10:31,911 --> 00:10:33,378
Insolent child.

158
00:10:35,715 --> 00:10:38,843
Wow. Somebody needs
more fiber in their diet.

159
00:10:38,918 --> 00:10:40,510
And I'm not a child.

160
00:10:42,922 --> 00:10:45,482
Hi. I'm Dylan.

161
00:10:46,025 --> 00:10:48,653
Hi. I'm not your type.

162
00:10:53,899 --> 00:10:55,389
Hey! No magic allowed.

163
00:10:56,602 --> 00:10:58,433
She speaks Latin.

164
00:10:58,504 --> 00:11:00,802
Please tell me
you're not crushed on that.

165
00:11:00,873 --> 00:11:02,534
Into a fine powder.

166
00:11:03,275 --> 00:11:04,902
Time to go home, Dylan.

167
00:11:05,478 --> 00:11:07,412
Uh... not really.

168
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:10,415
- Uh... yeah, it is.
- I'm staying.

169
00:11:10,483 --> 00:11:14,078
That's funny, 'cause it just sounded
like you said you're staying.

170
00:11:14,153 --> 00:11:15,745
- I'm a student.
- Where?

171
00:11:15,821 --> 00:11:17,083
- Here.
- That's funny,

172
00:11:17,156 --> 00:11:19,624
'cause it just sounded
like you said, "here. "

173
00:11:19,692 --> 00:11:23,150
Mom only agreed to let you go
if I said I'd go too.

174
00:11:23,229 --> 00:11:25,561
Trust me.
I don't want to be here, either.

175
00:11:25,631 --> 00:11:27,189
Are you kidding me?

176
00:11:28,601 --> 00:11:30,159
I gotta go find my dorm.

177
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:42,843
Fantastic.
What a great room.

178
00:11:49,155 --> 00:11:50,622
No magic in school?

179
00:11:51,223 --> 00:11:52,622
This is Halloweentown.

180
00:11:52,691 --> 00:11:55,216
It's supposed to be all magic,
all the time.

181
00:11:56,162 --> 00:11:59,723
I can't believe my mom
sent my little brother to baby-sit me.

182
00:12:00,299 --> 00:12:03,860
Clean up on aisle seven.
Clean up on aisle seven.

183
00:12:09,642 --> 00:12:12,372
Still waiting
on check stand three.

184
00:12:18,517 --> 00:12:21,145
Ooh. Nice bracelet.

185
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:23,115
Grandma?

186
00:12:24,123 --> 00:12:25,784
What are you doing here?

187
00:12:25,858 --> 00:12:28,349
Visiting you at college, of course.

188
00:12:28,427 --> 00:12:31,328
Ooh, I was hoping you'd get this room.

189
00:12:31,931 --> 00:12:33,296
Where's Sophie?

190
00:12:33,365 --> 00:12:37,768
Oh, she's touring the galaxy
with some little green docents.

191
00:12:37,837 --> 00:12:39,771
I've seen it a million times.

192
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:42,603
I'm so glad you're here.
I have so many questions.

193
00:12:42,675 --> 00:12:45,166
And so little time.

194
00:12:45,244 --> 00:12:47,838
You know, your mother's on your side.

195
00:12:47,913 --> 00:12:50,177
Try to cut her some slack.

196
00:12:50,249 --> 00:12:51,409
OK.

197
00:12:51,483 --> 00:12:53,144
Oh, dear.

198
00:12:53,219 --> 00:12:57,155
A solar flare is about to interfere
with my slip stream.

199
00:12:58,357 --> 00:13:01,019
You must be very careful
while you're here, dear.

200
00:13:01,093 --> 00:13:02,685
There are secrets.

201
00:13:03,329 --> 00:13:05,627
Things I should have told you.

202
00:13:06,232 --> 00:13:07,392
Tell me now.

203
00:13:10,336 --> 00:13:11,860
There's no time.

204
00:13:11,937 --> 00:13:14,201
- Oh.
- Grandma.

205
00:13:14,273 --> 00:13:15,934
I'm sorry, dear.

206
00:13:25,918 --> 00:13:28,978
What if she's not OK
and that's why she isn't calling?

207
00:13:30,789 --> 00:13:32,484
I'm just not good at this.

208
00:13:32,558 --> 00:13:35,083
- Coupon?
- Oh, right. Here.

209
00:13:36,428 --> 00:13:37,952
I'm a mom.

210
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:40,658
That's what I do.
That's what I've always done.

211
00:13:40,733 --> 00:13:44,396
I guess I just didn't realize
they'd all fly off at once.

212
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:48,563
I have an empty nest.

213
00:13:50,476 --> 00:13:54,071
- Will there be anything else?
- I just want my little birdies back.

214
00:13:56,749 --> 00:13:58,273
Ma'am, your groceries.

215
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:06,856
We need assistance in floral.

216
00:14:06,926 --> 00:14:08,188
Assistance in floral.

217
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:10,455
Meltdown on register three.

218
00:14:36,922 --> 00:14:38,321
Come in!

219
00:14:42,728 --> 00:14:43,888
How Zen.

220
00:14:45,731 --> 00:14:47,198
Hello?

221
00:14:47,266 --> 00:14:50,463
Um... My name's Marnie Piper.

222
00:14:50,536 --> 00:14:54,165
I got your card, and, um, I just...

223
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,419
Holy... smokes.

224
00:15:09,922 --> 00:15:14,086
Marnie. I'm Aneesa,
your resident advisor.

225
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,421
My resident advisor's a genie?

226
00:15:16,495 --> 00:15:18,895
The first to be accepted
to Witch University.

227
00:15:18,964 --> 00:15:22,297
- My parents are very proud. Tea?
- Yes, thank you.

228
00:15:22,368 --> 00:15:26,134
I invited you here to talk about you.
Any questions about the school?

229
00:15:26,205 --> 00:15:30,232
Yeah. What's with the three style slaves
that patrol the commons?

230
00:15:30,309 --> 00:15:31,970
Sinister sisters.

231
00:15:32,044 --> 00:15:34,911
Well, I mean,
they're a bit snippy, but...

232
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:39,178
Sinister's their real name.
Scarlett, Sapphire and Sage Sinister.

233
00:15:39,251 --> 00:15:41,947
Their father's
a very rich and powerful warlock.

234
00:15:42,855 --> 00:15:44,345
They rule the school.

235
00:15:50,696 --> 00:15:54,223
Specials today
are monster mash with pigs' wings,

236
00:15:54,299 --> 00:15:57,757
dung beetle salad, newts' eye gravy
and succotash a la scorpion.

237
00:15:57,836 --> 00:15:59,827
Thank you.

238
00:16:05,911 --> 00:16:08,709
Hey, if magic is illegal,
how come they get to use it?

239
00:16:08,781 --> 00:16:09,941
They're not.

240
00:16:10,649 --> 00:16:15,052
Some guys will do anything for Scarlett
and her sisters, even if it's illegal.

241
00:16:18,257 --> 00:16:19,849
Teacher!

242
00:16:22,061 --> 00:16:24,325
Don't they have any self-respect?

243
00:16:26,598 --> 00:16:28,429
- Hey.
- Hey.

244
00:16:30,502 --> 00:16:33,335
Wow. That's quite a vocabulary
you guys got there.

245
00:16:33,405 --> 00:16:36,397
I can hardly keep up.
Marnie, this is...?

246
00:16:36,475 --> 00:16:37,908
Ethan Dalloway.

247
00:16:37,976 --> 00:16:39,671
You two know each other?

248
00:16:43,949 --> 00:16:47,908
I just wanted to say I'm sorry,
you know, for everything.

249
00:16:50,122 --> 00:16:51,384
No, I'm sorry.

250
00:16:51,457 --> 00:16:55,223
It must be really difficult,
dealing with your father's exile.

251
00:16:55,294 --> 00:16:57,353
Yeah, but your grandma's been great.

252
00:16:57,429 --> 00:17:01,559
I worked for her over the summer,
helping her collect potion ingredients.

253
00:17:01,633 --> 00:17:04,067
- Snake spit, frog phlegm...
- Mmm.

254
00:17:04,136 --> 00:17:05,364
We get the picture.

255
00:17:07,239 --> 00:17:09,469
- You guys want to sit down?
- Yeah.

256
00:17:12,811 --> 00:17:15,006
So do you have your class list yet?

257
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:17,344
Yeah, I've got History of the World,

258
00:17:17,416 --> 00:17:20,908
Magic Immortal, Magic Themes
Using Classic Literature...

259
00:17:20,986 --> 00:17:23,784
You know, pretty normal college classes.

260
00:17:23,856 --> 00:17:26,450
So what's up with this no magic rule?

261
00:17:26,525 --> 00:17:30,518
That's new. Students used to be required
to use their magic in classes.

262
00:17:30,596 --> 00:17:33,429
That was when Witch University
was for witches only,

263
00:17:33,499 --> 00:17:36,297
no monsters or mummies
or genies allowed.

264
00:17:36,368 --> 00:17:38,529
- When did it change?
- Last year.

265
00:17:38,604 --> 00:17:41,539
- Who's the dork that changed it?
- You are.

266
00:17:41,607 --> 00:17:42,767
Me?

267
00:17:42,841 --> 00:17:45,036
When you opened the portal
between the worlds

268
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:48,136
kids from Halloweentown
went to college in the mortal world.

269
00:17:48,213 --> 00:17:51,376
- Why would they do that?
- Why would anyone go off to college?

270
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:53,577
To get away from Mom and Dad, far away.

271
00:17:53,652 --> 00:17:54,744
A world away.

272
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:58,847
Witch University needed more students so
they opened enrollment to non-witches.

273
00:17:58,924 --> 00:18:02,052
- That's how I got in, because of you.
- Well, that's great,

274
00:18:02,127 --> 00:18:06,257
- but why no magic?
- To level the academic playing field.

275
00:18:06,331 --> 00:18:09,630
It wouldn't be fair if witches
could use magic to do coursework

276
00:18:09,701 --> 00:18:12,101
and the rest had to do it
the old-fashioned way.

277
00:18:12,171 --> 00:18:15,004
But look around.
Some of us aren't following the rules.

278
00:18:15,073 --> 00:18:17,132
The Sinister sisters, those guys.

279
00:18:17,209 --> 00:18:18,506
They're using magic.

280
00:18:18,577 --> 00:18:21,375
But they make sure
no faculty member is watching.

281
00:18:21,446 --> 00:18:25,610
That's rule number two. Do all the magic
you want, just don't get caught.

282
00:18:30,589 --> 00:18:33,319
There. All I needed was a job.

283
00:18:34,893 --> 00:18:39,421
My nest isn't empty.
It's full... of potential.

284
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:45,760
Hi. I'm Gwen Piper,
real estate agent of this real estate.

285
00:18:45,837 --> 00:18:49,466
- If you have any questions at all...
- What a dump.

286
00:18:49,541 --> 00:18:52,169
I mean, the front yard
is totally a mess.

287
00:18:52,244 --> 00:18:55,077
I mean, would it kill somebody
to rake a leaf or two?

288
00:19:16,602 --> 00:19:19,366
I really should tidy up now.
Where are you hiding?

289
00:19:19,438 --> 00:19:22,635
- Befuddled.
- Discombobulated.

290
00:19:23,976 --> 00:19:27,776
- I vote for flummoxed.
- Flummoxed it is.

291
00:19:27,846 --> 00:19:31,247
Professor Periwinkle's
most definitely flummoxed.

292
00:19:31,316 --> 00:19:33,477
She's a dead ringer for Grandma.

293
00:19:33,552 --> 00:19:35,611
Ah!

294
00:19:37,155 --> 00:19:38,713
Oh, fiddlesticks.

295
00:19:43,462 --> 00:19:45,259
That will be our little secret.

296
00:19:46,898 --> 00:19:51,301
Now. I seem to have misplaced my
Collected Works of William Shakespeare.

297
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:58,003
- I have a copy, Professor.
- Oh, lovely.

298
00:19:58,076 --> 00:20:01,409
Extra credit for being well-prepared,
Miss Sinister.

299
00:20:09,054 --> 00:20:11,386
It's not fair.
She takes my book,

300
00:20:11,456 --> 00:20:14,289
breaks the no magic rule
and gets extra credit for it.

301
00:20:14,359 --> 00:20:17,419
Hey, um, Scarlett, I was wondering
if you'd like to help out

302
00:20:17,496 --> 00:20:20,329
with the millennium celebration
culinary committee.

303
00:20:20,399 --> 00:20:22,924
- You're drooling.
- Oh. Only when I'm around food

304
00:20:23,001 --> 00:20:25,333
or think about food
or food-like substances.

305
00:20:25,404 --> 00:20:27,099
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

306
00:20:27,172 --> 00:20:29,606
Scram, snot boy.

307
00:20:39,451 --> 00:20:41,885
- Are you OK?
- She called you snot boy.

308
00:20:41,953 --> 00:20:45,150
She just can never remember my name.
It's kind of a hard one.

309
00:20:45,223 --> 00:20:50,160
- What is it?
- the Third.

310
00:20:50,228 --> 00:20:52,093
Yeah, that's a toughie.

311
00:20:52,898 --> 00:20:56,493
How come there's never a teacher around
to see them use magic?

312
00:20:57,402 --> 00:20:59,870
Thank you. Everyone's been very kind.

313
00:21:00,839 --> 00:21:02,397
Apparently not everyone.

314
00:21:11,683 --> 00:21:13,708
Ethan.

315
00:21:16,388 --> 00:21:17,821
I'm sure.

316
00:21:20,659 --> 00:21:24,220
My name is Dr. Ichabod Grogg.

317
00:21:24,296 --> 00:21:27,231
You will address me as "sir"

318
00:21:27,299 --> 00:21:29,267
or "Dr. Grogg. "

319
00:21:29,334 --> 00:21:30,961
Not "Grogg,"

320
00:21:31,036 --> 00:21:32,970
"Dr. G,"

321
00:21:33,038 --> 00:21:36,201
"G-dawg" or "G-units. "

322
00:21:39,277 --> 00:21:43,043
On the desk before you,
you will find a single sheet of paper.

323
00:21:43,949 --> 00:21:47,976
I require an essay
to ascertain your familiarity

324
00:21:48,053 --> 00:21:52,422
with your entire history of the worlds,
both mortal and magical.

325
00:21:53,692 --> 00:21:55,717
You may begin.

326
00:22:32,964 --> 00:22:34,932
Thank you, Miss Sinister.

327
00:22:56,221 --> 00:22:58,917
Dr. Grogg, sir,
I think we got off on the wrong foot,

328
00:22:58,990 --> 00:23:00,855
- and I just wanted to say...
- Stop!

329
00:23:00,926 --> 00:23:02,553
Explain yourself.

330
00:23:03,295 --> 00:23:05,195
That isn't my paper.

331
00:23:05,263 --> 00:23:09,222
I wrote a full page. It was thoughtful,
well-organized and concise.

332
00:23:09,301 --> 00:23:11,292
Something appears to be missing.

333
00:23:11,369 --> 00:23:13,098
The words, perhaps.

334
00:23:13,171 --> 00:23:15,935
That witch hexed my paper!

335
00:23:22,914 --> 00:23:24,905
Hmm.

336
00:23:24,983 --> 00:23:27,884
It appears someone did use magic
on this assignment.

337
00:23:27,953 --> 00:23:30,649
- Ha. See!
- What I see, Miss Piper,

338
00:23:30,722 --> 00:23:33,748
is that you were in possession
of a hexed essay.

339
00:23:33,825 --> 00:23:39,161
There will be a thorough investigation,
and there will be consequences.

340
00:23:41,266 --> 00:23:43,700
I can't believe it.
Scarlett did that.

341
00:23:43,768 --> 00:23:45,633
I should make her disappear.

342
00:23:45,704 --> 00:23:47,433
Maybe she's just jealous.

343
00:23:49,808 --> 00:23:51,139
You were ranting.

344
00:23:51,209 --> 00:23:54,440
Why in the world would Scarlett Sinister
be jealous of me?

345
00:23:54,513 --> 00:23:55,878
Look...

346
00:24:02,754 --> 00:24:05,814
- Ethan, that's so sweet.
- Marnie Piper.

347
00:24:05,891 --> 00:24:09,156
You're wanted
in the chancellor's office.

348
00:24:09,227 --> 00:24:10,888
Now!

349
00:24:10,962 --> 00:24:12,520
Alrighty, then.

350
00:24:18,236 --> 00:24:21,034
Dr. Goodwyn, I know why I'm here
and in my defense...

351
00:24:21,106 --> 00:24:23,404
- Marnie, you're not in trouble.
- I'm not?

352
00:24:24,376 --> 00:24:25,934
- How weird.
- Tea?

353
00:24:30,181 --> 00:24:33,639
Thanks. So can we find out
who hexed my essay?

354
00:24:33,718 --> 00:24:37,449
Some spells leave a genetic fingerprint,
but this one was too common.

355
00:24:37,522 --> 00:24:39,319
Could have been anyone.

356
00:24:41,226 --> 00:24:43,490
So how are you adjusting?

357
00:24:43,562 --> 00:24:47,362
Honestly, I came here
to learn alchemy and amulets,

358
00:24:47,432 --> 00:24:48,956
potions and portence.

359
00:24:49,801 --> 00:24:52,736
I mean, can't you offer an elective,
just for witches?

360
00:24:52,804 --> 00:24:55,466
- You didn't read the handbook?
- I skimmed.

361
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:57,201
When this school was established

362
00:24:57,275 --> 00:24:59,766
an enchantment
was placed on the campus.

363
00:24:59,844 --> 00:25:01,778
All spells cast at Witch University

364
00:25:01,846 --> 00:25:04,246
become permanent
at midnight on Halloween.

365
00:25:04,316 --> 00:25:06,978
- You mean permanent-permanent?
- Indeed.

366
00:25:07,052 --> 00:25:09,748
And, for many years,
it was a fine deterrent.

367
00:25:09,821 --> 00:25:12,085
Until we had a small mishap.

368
00:25:12,591 --> 00:25:13,717
How small?

369
00:25:13,792 --> 00:25:17,353
A simple magical housekeeping lesson
went horribly wrong.

370
00:25:17,429 --> 00:25:20,523
Half the freshman class
had to be sent home as teacups.

371
00:25:26,938 --> 00:25:31,136
I'm just disappointed. I mean, I came
here to learn how to be a great witch.

372
00:25:31,876 --> 00:25:33,969
- Like you.
- Marnie.

373
00:25:34,846 --> 00:25:38,247
You will learn more about yourself here
than you ever imagined.

374
00:25:40,251 --> 00:25:42,310
We are late for your next class.

375
00:25:43,121 --> 00:25:44,679
"We?"

376
00:25:48,293 --> 00:25:50,761
Good. The class is all here.

377
00:25:51,630 --> 00:25:53,564
But, uh, no classroom.

378
00:25:54,633 --> 00:25:58,069
Adaperio perplaceo.

379
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:07,544
This is the old castle dungeon.

380
00:26:07,612 --> 00:26:11,446
It's usually off-limits, but this year
we've selected a few of you

381
00:26:11,516 --> 00:26:14,883
for a very special
educational opportunity.

382
00:26:14,953 --> 00:26:18,184
You will spend this semester
unearthing the treasures

383
00:26:18,256 --> 00:26:20,850
of a millennium of Halloweentown history

384
00:26:20,925 --> 00:26:22,984
buried beneath this castle.

385
00:26:23,061 --> 00:26:27,225
Three-quarters of your grade will be
based on your personal discoveries.

386
00:26:27,298 --> 00:26:32,736
You will be supervised in your work by
our own expert in all things historical,

387
00:26:32,804 --> 00:26:34,704
Dr. Ichabod Grogg.

388
00:26:34,773 --> 00:26:36,673
The fossil himself.

389
00:26:37,542 --> 00:26:39,203
Hmm.

390
00:26:39,911 --> 00:26:41,572
He's right behind me, isn't he?

391
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:44,111
- Yeah.
- A thousand years ago

392
00:26:44,182 --> 00:26:48,482
this school was built on the ruins
of Miss Piper's ancestral home,

393
00:26:48,553 --> 00:26:50,783
Cromwell Castle.

394
00:26:53,725 --> 00:26:57,252
I will instruct you all
in the manual art

395
00:26:57,328 --> 00:27:00,456
of archaeological recovery
and identification.

396
00:27:00,532 --> 00:27:03,660
I expect great things.

397
00:27:03,735 --> 00:27:05,327
Please gather round.

398
00:27:07,572 --> 00:27:12,373
At any archaeological site these are
the tools of the trade you will use.

399
00:27:12,444 --> 00:27:14,139
First the...

400
00:27:15,513 --> 00:27:16,980
Boo.

401
00:27:19,084 --> 00:27:21,882
You must be so curious
what's down there.

402
00:27:21,953 --> 00:27:23,250
- What?
- What?

403
00:27:24,089 --> 00:27:26,114
Priceless family heirlooms...

404
00:27:26,191 --> 00:27:27,283
Buried treasure...

405
00:27:27,358 --> 00:27:29,485
I'm just here to learn,
like everybody else.

406
00:27:29,561 --> 00:27:32,462
But we're not like everyone else.

407
00:27:32,530 --> 00:27:36,193
You heard what Goodwyn said.
What we find here determines our grade.

408
00:27:36,267 --> 00:27:39,065
We're witches. We have powers.

409
00:27:39,137 --> 00:27:41,298
Which would be unfair to use.

410
00:27:41,372 --> 00:27:44,364
What's unfair is having our magic
bottled up like this.

411
00:27:44,442 --> 00:27:47,411
I don't know about you,
but my fingers are just itching

412
00:27:47,479 --> 00:27:51,540
to zap some nasty old Cromwell antiques
out of that hole.

413
00:27:51,616 --> 00:27:53,777
...and paintbrushes...

414
00:27:54,719 --> 00:27:55,879
Ew.

415
00:27:55,954 --> 00:27:58,752
Dr. Grogg, look what I found.

416
00:28:35,693 --> 00:28:38,127
- "S. Cromwell?"
- What's in there?

417
00:28:38,196 --> 00:28:40,255
Gadzooks.

418
00:28:42,634 --> 00:28:46,070
- How do I open it?
- Use a key?

419
00:28:47,038 --> 00:28:48,938
Where is the key?

420
00:28:49,007 --> 00:28:50,565
Don't look at me.

421
00:28:53,411 --> 00:28:56,403
- You just had to show off.
- What?

422
00:28:56,481 --> 00:28:57,914
You used magic in class.

423
00:28:57,982 --> 00:29:00,473
It's all over school.
You could be expelled.

424
00:29:00,552 --> 00:29:02,383
I didn't use magic.

425
00:29:02,453 --> 00:29:05,980
Tell him, you guys,
I didn't use magic to dig up that box.

426
00:29:06,057 --> 00:29:08,218
Sorry, Marnie, but it didn't look good.

427
00:29:08,293 --> 00:29:11,558
Yeah, the whole earth-shaking
beam of light thing.

428
00:29:11,629 --> 00:29:13,654
The box landed right in your hand.

429
00:29:13,731 --> 00:29:15,255
But I didn't do anything.

430
00:29:15,333 --> 00:29:18,359
It just came to me
like it wanted to be with me.

431
00:29:18,436 --> 00:29:21,132
Like it... belonged to me.

432
00:29:27,045 --> 00:29:30,014
And now,
a reading of the prophecy.

433
00:29:31,149 --> 00:29:34,414
"And it shall come to pass,
at the close of the first millennium,

434
00:29:34,485 --> 00:29:36,715
at the rise of the Halloween moon,

435
00:29:36,788 --> 00:29:40,280
a Cromwell of great power
will embrace the Gift

436
00:29:40,358 --> 00:29:44,590
and all the world will find peace
under her dominion. "

437
00:29:44,662 --> 00:29:47,187
Marnie Piper is the Cromwell
of the prophecy,

438
00:29:47,265 --> 00:29:49,165
the one we have waited for.

439
00:29:49,234 --> 00:29:53,500
And I am happy to report
the child has found the ancient box

440
00:29:53,571 --> 00:29:55,266
which contains the Gift.

441
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:59,936
Soon we will rule Halloweentown.

442
00:30:00,011 --> 00:30:02,138
- Or not.
- Girls.

443
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:05,877
- Hi, Daddy.
- Come in, come in.

444
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:07,815
You have made me so proud.

445
00:30:07,886 --> 00:30:10,855
I heard how you lured the Piper girl
into using her magic

446
00:30:10,922 --> 00:30:13,823
to bring forth the box.
Well done.

447
00:30:14,425 --> 00:30:17,053
Now you must get her to open it.

448
00:30:17,128 --> 00:30:19,255
Uh... yeah.

449
00:30:19,330 --> 00:30:22,822
Well, listen,
that's not gonna be so easy.

450
00:30:22,901 --> 00:30:26,962
- This Marnie chick is super tough.
- She's just so goody-goody.

451
00:30:27,038 --> 00:30:31,338
Why don't you just open the box?
Everybody knows you're super-powerful.

452
00:30:31,409 --> 00:30:33,309
Silence!

453
00:30:33,378 --> 00:30:36,176
Only a Cromwell may unleash the power!

454
00:30:36,247 --> 00:30:39,410
Grogg. Please.

455
00:30:42,453 --> 00:30:45,911
Honey, Marnie Piper has to open the box

456
00:30:45,990 --> 00:30:48,356
for the prophecy to be fulfilled.

457
00:30:48,426 --> 00:30:51,418
- Oh.
- Yeah, but if she has to use magic,

458
00:30:51,496 --> 00:30:54,897
- there's no way.
- Goody-goody, remember?

459
00:30:54,966 --> 00:30:57,628
Yeah. She, like, follows the rules.

460
00:30:57,702 --> 00:30:59,829
Then we must work together, girls.

461
00:30:59,904 --> 00:31:03,101
We must tempt her to break the rules.

462
00:31:03,174 --> 00:31:07,110
She must use her own magic
to open that box.

463
00:31:07,178 --> 00:31:09,442
Do you understand?

464
00:31:11,416 --> 00:31:12,883
Whatever.

465
00:31:24,262 --> 00:31:25,957
This is gonna take forever.

466
00:31:26,764 --> 00:31:28,356
Maybe I could just...

467
00:31:30,568 --> 00:31:31,728
Nah.

468
00:31:35,673 --> 00:31:38,141
- Don't do that to me!
- I'm sorry. I just...

469
00:31:38,209 --> 00:31:41,736
I hadn't heard from you, and I wanted
to make sure you were all right.

470
00:31:41,813 --> 00:31:45,613
I'm fine, Mom.
Dylan's Dylan, but he's fine too.

471
00:31:45,683 --> 00:31:48,709
Oh, good. I'm fine, really.

472
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:51,579
- I'm fine.
- You can't do this to me.

473
00:31:51,656 --> 00:31:54,181
If I get caught using magic
I could be expelled.

474
00:31:54,258 --> 00:31:55,987
What? Expelled?

475
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:59,689
I'm sorry.
I just knew that I'd find you here.

476
00:31:59,764 --> 00:32:01,732
You knew I'd be doing my laundry?

477
00:32:01,799 --> 00:32:04,029
- Are you spying on me?
- No.

478
00:32:05,036 --> 00:32:07,596
When I was in college I did laundry
on Wednesdays too.

479
00:32:07,672 --> 00:32:10,436
Great. I'll be expelled
for being predictable.

480
00:32:11,709 --> 00:32:15,668
Mom, do you know anything about
a family heirloom, some silver box?

481
00:32:15,747 --> 00:32:19,046
- Silver box?
- It's ancient, filthy...

482
00:32:19,584 --> 00:32:22,985
- Man, does it need washing.
- Marnie! Wait.

483
00:32:23,054 --> 00:32:24,885
I love you!

484
00:32:25,890 --> 00:32:29,519
Yup. I love this plumbing.

485
00:32:29,594 --> 00:32:32,154
It's really good plumbing.

486
00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:34,892
I can't get enough of it.

487
00:32:35,633 --> 00:32:37,931
- Am I seeing what I think I'm seeing?
- Yes.

488
00:32:38,002 --> 00:32:41,494
You've spotted the elusive guy
doing his own laundry.

489
00:32:41,572 --> 00:32:43,164
A rare creature, indeed.

490
00:32:45,643 --> 00:32:49,238
So, uh, you want to
just zap this stuff clean

491
00:32:49,313 --> 00:32:51,975
and go get a cup of coffee with me?

492
00:32:52,050 --> 00:32:55,542
Mmm... I was just accused
of using magic when I didn't.

493
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:58,384
I'm not about to be accused
of using magic when I did.

494
00:32:59,624 --> 00:33:04,254
I have no idea what you just said,
but you looked really cute saying it.

495
00:33:06,097 --> 00:33:09,430
- Why don't you just use your magic?
- What magic would that be?

496
00:33:10,234 --> 00:33:12,395
You know.

497
00:33:13,471 --> 00:33:15,496
We're not talking about laundry?

498
00:33:15,573 --> 00:33:19,771
Marnie Piper,
meet the chancellor at the dig site.

499
00:33:19,844 --> 00:33:21,903
Sorry.

500
00:33:23,314 --> 00:33:25,748
Chancellor really needs
to get a cell phone.

501
00:33:27,518 --> 00:33:30,578
- Rain check on the coffee?
- And the magic.

502
00:33:48,039 --> 00:33:49,438
Oh, it's beautiful.

503
00:33:54,812 --> 00:33:56,939
- Let's open it.
- Small problem.

504
00:33:57,014 --> 00:34:00,108
- There's no key.
- Piffle. That's what magic is for.

505
00:34:01,152 --> 00:34:04,315
- Are you kidding?
- I'm chancellor of this university.

506
00:34:04,388 --> 00:34:06,618
If I say it's OK, then it's OK.

507
00:34:08,693 --> 00:34:10,558
Is this a trap?

508
00:34:11,996 --> 00:34:15,261
Marnie, you're young.
You're a witch.

509
00:34:15,333 --> 00:34:18,928
- Have a little fun.
- You don't have to tell me twice.

510
00:34:20,037 --> 00:34:21,937
Or three times.

511
00:35:05,716 --> 00:35:07,183
Open sesame?

512
00:35:07,852 --> 00:35:09,843
Oh, well, that was a bust.

513
00:35:13,824 --> 00:35:16,019
- Goodwyn actually asked you to...
- Shh!

514
00:35:16,093 --> 00:35:18,288
...use magic to open the box?

515
00:35:18,362 --> 00:35:21,593
Yes. I couldn't believe it,
but nothing worked.

516
00:35:21,666 --> 00:35:24,499
- Nada.
- Why didn't she open it?

517
00:35:24,569 --> 00:35:28,733
She said it belonged to a Cromwell,
so only a Cromwell could open it.

518
00:35:28,806 --> 00:35:30,637
If only I had the key.

519
00:35:31,576 --> 00:35:35,012
Hey, you think, maybe,
you could do that smokey smokey thing

520
00:35:35,079 --> 00:35:36,979
and just take a peek inside?

521
00:35:38,015 --> 00:35:40,176
That only works with my own lamp.

522
00:35:40,751 --> 00:35:41,843
Shoot.

523
00:35:41,919 --> 00:35:44,410
S. Cromwell would know where the key is.

524
00:35:44,488 --> 00:35:46,683
I wonder what
the "S" stands for, anyway.

525
00:35:46,757 --> 00:35:50,352
My grandma would know. She knows
everything about Halloweentown.

526
00:35:50,428 --> 00:35:54,228
I wish I could talk to her.
I don't know where she is.

527
00:35:54,298 --> 00:35:55,788
I don't know when she is.

528
00:35:59,704 --> 00:36:04,266
So what do Shakespeare's characters
in Midsummer Night's Dream

529
00:36:04,342 --> 00:36:06,469
teach us about love?

530
00:36:06,544 --> 00:36:09,672
Well, Helena knew
her boyfriend was a jerk,

531
00:36:09,747 --> 00:36:11,510
but she loved him anyway.

532
00:36:11,582 --> 00:36:15,348
Only because that freaky little fairy
cast a magic spell on them.

533
00:36:15,419 --> 00:36:18,320
Fairies are not freaks.

534
00:36:18,389 --> 00:36:22,382
Sorry. I'm just saying it's not love
if he's forced to like her.

535
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:24,519
Maybe she likes controlling him.

536
00:36:24,595 --> 00:36:28,759
But you don't control someone you love.
That would be a nightmare, not a dream.

537
00:36:28,833 --> 00:36:31,097
Wonderful discussion.

538
00:36:31,168 --> 00:36:35,036
All right, we'll pick this up Monday.
Have a lovely weekend, all.

539
00:36:41,545 --> 00:36:44,605
- Professor Periwinkle?
- Yes, dear?

540
00:36:44,682 --> 00:36:46,980
Do you think I could talk
to you sometime?

541
00:36:49,353 --> 00:36:53,255
- This is your office?
- It's larger than it appears.

542
00:37:01,299 --> 00:37:03,290
- This is wonderful.
- Yes.

543
00:37:05,603 --> 00:37:08,936
So you obviously don't adhere
to the no magic rule in here?

544
00:37:09,006 --> 00:37:12,635
Oh, heavens, no.
I refused to sign that pledge.

545
00:37:12,710 --> 00:37:14,940
What is it you kids say these days?

546
00:37:15,012 --> 00:37:17,572
"Not gonna let the man
keep me down?"

547
00:37:17,648 --> 00:37:19,912
We kids haven't said that for awhile.

548
00:37:19,984 --> 00:37:22,919
What is it, dear?

549
00:37:22,987 --> 00:37:27,151
It's just, you remind me of someone
I really miss right now.

550
00:37:27,892 --> 00:37:31,487
Well, you're welcome here anytime.

551
00:37:33,464 --> 00:37:37,457
- So how is your grandmother?
- You know my grandmother?

552
00:37:37,535 --> 00:37:41,266
Our families have been friends
since before Halloweentown existed.

553
00:37:41,339 --> 00:37:43,864
Well, do you know an S. Cromwell?

554
00:37:43,941 --> 00:37:46,466
- A Susan or a Sara or a...?
- Splendora.

555
00:37:46,544 --> 00:37:49,604
I wondered when you were
going to ask about her.

556
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:53,081
- I haven't heard that name in years.
- So you know her.

557
00:37:53,150 --> 00:37:56,176
Oh, yes, I knew her.
A very long time ago.

558
00:37:56,253 --> 00:37:59,711
You're not about to tell me
Splendora is you, are you?

559
00:37:59,790 --> 00:38:02,418
Because I'm having
a very strange Star Wars moment.

560
00:38:02,493 --> 00:38:05,621
No. Splendora was my friend.

561
00:38:06,530 --> 00:38:09,465
We met in the early days
of Halloweentown.

562
00:38:09,533 --> 00:38:12,195
- Well, what can you tell me about her?
- Nothing.

563
00:38:12,269 --> 00:38:14,703
- Nothing?
- I've said too much already.

564
00:38:14,772 --> 00:38:18,674
I made a promise
to keep Splendora's identity a secret.

565
00:38:18,743 --> 00:38:21,177
But you can tell me.
I can keep a secret.

566
00:38:21,245 --> 00:38:23,304
No. It's too soon.

567
00:38:23,381 --> 00:38:26,373
- You're simply not ready.
- Not ready for what?

568
00:38:26,951 --> 00:38:30,387
When you can answer that yourself,
you'll be ready.

569
00:38:30,454 --> 00:38:33,548
Now, I'm sorry, Marnie.
I can say no more.

570
00:38:36,594 --> 00:38:39,529
Amo. Amas.

571
00:38:40,331 --> 00:38:41,889
Amat.

572
00:38:43,067 --> 00:38:45,934
Scarlett, mei amate.

573
00:38:49,306 --> 00:38:51,035
I gotta change that ringtone.

574
00:38:53,310 --> 00:38:56,108
- What?
- Dylan, I need your help.

575
00:38:58,015 --> 00:38:59,505
What took you so long?

576
00:38:59,583 --> 00:39:02,484
I was in the middle of something.
I have a date tonight.

577
00:39:02,553 --> 00:39:04,885
Is that cologne?

578
00:39:04,955 --> 00:39:06,582
- Too much?
- Just a tad.

579
00:39:07,158 --> 00:39:10,559
- Where are we going?
- This way. Just stay downwind.

580
00:39:13,164 --> 00:39:15,428
You ever wonder
about our family history?

581
00:39:18,402 --> 00:39:20,597
Here's the place
to find out about it.

582
00:39:22,506 --> 00:39:25,475
History of the Cromwell's,
Little Cromwell Women,

583
00:39:25,543 --> 00:39:26,771
Cromwell's Inferno.

584
00:39:27,411 --> 00:39:29,971
All of these books
are about our family.

585
00:39:30,047 --> 00:39:31,810
Uh, yeah, I caught the theme.

586
00:39:31,882 --> 00:39:35,079
One of them has to tell us
who Splendora Cromwell was,

587
00:39:35,152 --> 00:39:37,279
and what she locked in that box.

588
00:39:37,354 --> 00:39:39,219
- Just give me a minute.
- A minute?

589
00:39:39,290 --> 00:39:42,521
- I know you're fast, but I mean...
- I'm more than fast.

590
00:39:42,593 --> 00:39:47,121
- I'm magic.
- Did you just use the "M" word?

591
00:39:47,198 --> 00:39:49,393
I use magic to speed read, OK?

592
00:39:49,467 --> 00:39:53,062
- Not here, but in high school.
- No wonder you skipped a grade.

593
00:39:53,137 --> 00:39:56,231
It's the only thing
I use my powers for, I swear.

594
00:39:56,941 --> 00:39:59,569
- But the rules...
- Oh, OK.

595
00:40:01,178 --> 00:40:02,975
I won't use magic to read.

596
00:40:13,624 --> 00:40:14,818
OK. Just do it.

597
00:40:48,325 --> 00:40:49,883
I know what's in the box.

598
00:40:50,895 --> 00:40:52,954
What? What's in the box?

599
00:40:53,030 --> 00:40:54,964
- Power.
- What kind of power?

600
00:40:55,032 --> 00:40:57,865
- The magical kind.
- That's my favorite kind.

601
00:40:58,402 --> 00:41:01,633
Inside that box is power
called the Gift, capital "G."

602
00:41:01,705 --> 00:41:05,698
It's a magical power
no other witch in Halloweentown has.

603
00:41:05,776 --> 00:41:09,678
A thousand years ago Splendora Cromwell
locked the Gift inside that box

604
00:41:09,747 --> 00:41:11,271
and buried it.

605
00:41:11,348 --> 00:41:14,044
- And?
- And nothing. That's all I know.

606
00:41:14,118 --> 00:41:17,417
There were... pages missing.

607
00:41:21,792 --> 00:41:23,089
Mei amo.

608
00:41:32,636 --> 00:41:34,501
Hey. Hi.

609
00:41:34,572 --> 00:41:35,903
Scarlett.

610
00:41:37,341 --> 00:41:40,469
- We had a date, remember?
- Sorry, it doesn't ring a bell.

611
00:41:40,544 --> 00:41:43,240
Oh. If you don't remember that's OK.

612
00:41:43,314 --> 00:41:46,181
Um... I'd like to buy you dinner.

613
00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:50,050
And I'd really like a unicorn
for a pet, but...

614
00:41:50,554 --> 00:41:53,148
...that's not gonna happen either,
is it, toad?

615
00:41:53,223 --> 00:41:55,555
Hey, you can't talk
to my brother like that!

616
00:41:55,626 --> 00:41:57,719
Uh... yes she can.

617
00:41:57,795 --> 00:42:01,356
Talk to me like that
or any way you want, actually.

618
00:42:01,432 --> 00:42:04,424
Maybe I can help you and your sisters
with your homework.

619
00:42:04,501 --> 00:42:07,868
- Scarlett.
- Mmm.

620
00:42:07,938 --> 00:42:09,769
Let's go, baby.

621
00:42:12,776 --> 00:42:15,370
In a moment she will appear
in the cauldron.

622
00:42:18,048 --> 00:42:19,709
- Don't say anything.
- Dylan.

623
00:42:19,783 --> 00:42:22,843
- I don't want to talk about it.
- Something needs to be done.

624
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:25,115
She's using powers
to terrorize the school.

625
00:42:25,189 --> 00:42:27,487
That's what people with powers do.

626
00:42:27,558 --> 00:42:30,755
They wield them.
Just leave it alone, Marnie.

627
00:42:30,828 --> 00:42:34,855
No. After what she did to you,
I want to crush her into a fine powder.

628
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:38,529
Relax. It's Mom.

629
00:42:38,602 --> 00:42:40,570
You gotta change that ringtone.

630
00:42:40,638 --> 00:42:43,471
- Dylan, you're there.
- Where else would I be?

631
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:46,407
- Are you all right?
- I'm the same.

632
00:42:46,477 --> 00:42:48,570
Still a dork, still dateless.

633
00:42:48,646 --> 00:42:50,876
Dylan, hang on a sec.

634
00:42:50,948 --> 00:42:55,112
Now, sweetie, your father and I thought
you and Princess could share a room.

635
00:42:55,185 --> 00:42:58,814
- Princess needs her own room.
- OK, cupcake.

636
00:42:58,889 --> 00:43:02,848
We'll just keep looking.
After all, this is just a two bedroom.

637
00:43:03,894 --> 00:43:06,886
I'm sorry. Did I say two-bedroom?

638
00:43:06,964 --> 00:43:10,661
Oh. No, this is a large three-bedroom.

639
00:43:10,734 --> 00:43:12,099
Go look.

640
00:43:16,674 --> 00:43:18,608
Dylan, how's Marnie?

641
00:43:18,676 --> 00:43:21,668
She sounded a little distracted
when I talked to her.

642
00:43:21,745 --> 00:43:25,909
- Um, she's um...
- She's there with you now, isn't she?

643
00:43:25,983 --> 00:43:26,972
Yep. Put her on.

644
00:43:28,819 --> 00:43:32,277
Hey, Mom. I've got a ton of reading
to do, so I gotta run. Bye!

645
00:43:34,725 --> 00:43:36,192
You shut the pumpkin on Mom!

646
00:43:36,260 --> 00:43:39,320
- I can't tell her what's going on here.
- Why not?

647
00:43:39,396 --> 00:43:42,456
The last thing Mom wants me to have
is more magic.

648
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:46,927
Marnie, whatever's in that box
was buried for a thousand years,

649
00:43:47,004 --> 00:43:49,871
and I've got a feeling
it's supposed to stay that way.

650
00:43:51,108 --> 00:43:54,874
Time is running short
and her brother is becoming a problem.

651
00:43:54,945 --> 00:43:56,242
Then we must use him,

652
00:43:56,313 --> 00:43:59,146
- make him part of the solution.
- But he's her family.

653
00:43:59,216 --> 00:44:02,549
That just means
she will do anything to save him.

654
00:44:04,154 --> 00:44:05,485
Trust me.

655
00:44:17,801 --> 00:44:19,462
Hey, Rapunzel!

656
00:44:26,110 --> 00:44:28,010
Too bad. I just cut my hair.

657
00:44:28,078 --> 00:44:29,511
How's studying going?

658
00:44:29,580 --> 00:44:32,208
I wasn't studying.
I was doodling.

659
00:44:32,282 --> 00:44:33,715
Popular class, doodling.

660
00:44:33,784 --> 00:44:36,651
Yes, it's very difficult.
Dexterity and all that.

661
00:44:39,790 --> 00:44:42,657
Think you could take
a doodling break tonight?

662
00:44:42,726 --> 00:44:44,990
- Say, like, 8:00?
- I don't know.

663
00:44:45,062 --> 00:44:47,360
I have a doodle final on Monday.

664
00:44:47,431 --> 00:44:49,922
- But... OK.
- Great.

665
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,127
I'll see you tonight, then.

666
00:44:59,676 --> 00:45:01,041
- Hi, Kelly.
- Hey.

667
00:45:05,749 --> 00:45:06,943
- Hey.
- Hey.

668
00:45:07,017 --> 00:45:10,316
- I thought we were past that.
- We are. Definitely.

669
00:45:11,188 --> 00:45:13,156
So... it's a beautiful night.

670
00:45:13,223 --> 00:45:15,783
Yeah. Perfect for flying, right?

671
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:19,724
- Too bad we don't have a broom.
- Yeah, I love flying.

672
00:45:19,797 --> 00:45:22,265
It's my favorite thing
about being a witch.

673
00:45:22,332 --> 00:45:23,799
Mine, too.

674
00:45:29,973 --> 00:45:31,372
Ethan, it's beautiful.

675
00:45:31,441 --> 00:45:33,671
It was a gift from my dad,
from before.

676
00:45:34,411 --> 00:45:36,276
We couldn't... could we?

677
00:45:36,346 --> 00:45:38,746
Technically, we would be off campus.

678
00:45:39,583 --> 00:45:41,778
- You're right.
- You first.

679
00:45:53,263 --> 00:45:55,925
- Get on.
- I don't know.

680
00:45:56,733 --> 00:45:59,725
OK.

681
00:46:00,971 --> 00:46:03,064
I'm gonna regret this.

682
00:46:05,309 --> 00:46:07,777
- Hold on.
- Tree! Tree, tree!

683
00:46:07,845 --> 00:46:09,972
I got it.

684
00:46:16,787 --> 00:46:18,584
Yeah!

685
00:46:28,432 --> 00:46:30,366
Hey, look at that!

686
00:47:10,774 --> 00:47:12,435
Whoo!

687
00:47:17,214 --> 00:47:19,682
- Wow. That was great.
- Fun.

688
00:47:19,750 --> 00:47:22,082
- Ice cream?
- Sure. Sounds great.

689
00:47:22,152 --> 00:47:25,280
- We'll share it.
- Good. I'll get it right now.

690
00:47:26,623 --> 00:47:28,113
Banana.

691
00:47:35,365 --> 00:47:37,196
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

692
00:47:39,603 --> 00:47:41,093
Healthy appetite.

693
00:47:42,005 --> 00:47:45,031
- I like that in a girl.
- Thanks for getting me out.

694
00:47:45,108 --> 00:47:47,440
Somebody needed
to save you from doodling.

695
00:47:47,511 --> 00:47:51,174
Yeah. I've been kind of obsessed
with that box I found in Grogg's class.

696
00:47:51,248 --> 00:47:53,478
- So smart.
- And handsome.

697
00:47:53,550 --> 00:47:57,111
- Oh, great.
- Like, scary handsome.

698
00:47:58,121 --> 00:48:00,885
And super-scary handsome.

699
00:48:01,425 --> 00:48:04,223
- Thank you.
- You're super-welcome.

700
00:48:04,294 --> 00:48:07,957
So my physics test is like, take home.
Lucky, huh?

701
00:48:08,832 --> 00:48:11,858
And my psych essay has to be 500 words.

702
00:48:11,935 --> 00:48:16,565
I already have the title.
Mortals: Why Are They so Totally Boring?

703
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:18,301
Marnie, wait.

704
00:48:18,375 --> 00:48:22,141
- Clever.
- You're cute when you're thinking.

705
00:48:22,212 --> 00:48:25,807
I can almost see the little tiny gears
grinding in your head.

706
00:48:27,017 --> 00:48:30,953
- Get away from my brother.
- No. Don't get away.

707
00:48:31,021 --> 00:48:34,821
Relax, "Mom. "
He's just doing some tutoring.

708
00:48:34,891 --> 00:48:36,620
Did you just call me "Mom?"

709
00:48:36,693 --> 00:48:39,958
Yes, she did, so stop acting like her.

710
00:48:41,631 --> 00:48:43,758
- Dylan, get up.
- No.

711
00:48:44,901 --> 00:48:48,132
- You tell her, Dillie.
- Dillie?

712
00:48:48,205 --> 00:48:51,231
Maybe you should start
on my book report now.

713
00:48:51,308 --> 00:48:55,244
- Yeah, Dillie.
- OK. What did they use on you?

714
00:48:55,312 --> 00:48:57,644
A love potion?
An adoration amulet?

715
00:48:57,714 --> 00:48:59,978
He offered to help us, remember?

716
00:49:00,050 --> 00:49:05,010
OK, hexed pens are one thing, but how
could you use magic on my brother?

717
00:49:05,088 --> 00:49:08,114
We couldn't risk using our own magic
to do homework.

718
00:49:08,191 --> 00:49:11,024
Besides, I wouldn't call this magic.

719
00:49:11,094 --> 00:49:13,460
Really? What would you call it?

720
00:49:13,530 --> 00:49:15,862
- Cheating.
- Let him go.

721
00:49:19,669 --> 00:49:20,829
Make me.

722
00:49:23,540 --> 00:49:25,633
Don't have the power
to control me, do you?

723
00:49:27,511 --> 00:49:29,274
Not even close.

724
00:49:37,687 --> 00:49:39,348
Wait up, ladies.

725
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:45,518
Dylan!

726
00:49:46,430 --> 00:49:48,091
Dylan!

727
00:49:50,133 --> 00:49:52,067
How could they disappear that fast?

728
00:49:52,135 --> 00:49:53,727
Witches.

729
00:49:54,538 --> 00:49:55,800
Marnie, wait.

730
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:59,734
They could be casting another spell
on Dylan as we speak.

731
00:49:59,810 --> 00:50:02,802
To make him do what?
More math? He loves math.

732
00:50:05,248 --> 00:50:06,909
Are you coming or not?

733
00:50:19,329 --> 00:50:21,058
Whoa. What's going on?

734
00:50:21,131 --> 00:50:22,621
- I don't know.
- Whoa.

735
00:50:22,699 --> 00:50:24,599
- Whoa!
- What's happening?

736
00:50:24,668 --> 00:50:26,033
Whoa!

737
00:50:26,103 --> 00:50:29,004
- Something's not right.
- What do you mean, not right?

738
00:50:29,072 --> 00:50:30,733
I don't know!

739
00:50:31,775 --> 00:50:33,834
Hang on!

740
00:50:33,910 --> 00:50:37,073
Watch out!

741
00:50:42,486 --> 00:50:44,181
Hello, landing gear.

742
00:50:44,254 --> 00:50:46,222
Sorry. I don't know what happened.

743
00:50:48,925 --> 00:50:51,223
- There it is.
- Wait.

744
00:50:51,294 --> 00:50:54,422
- I can't believe it.
- The broom's a snake.

745
00:50:55,999 --> 00:51:00,129
- Scarlett jinxed our broom.
- I think she set us up.

746
00:51:00,203 --> 00:51:02,933
She knew where we'd be,
she knew we'd have my broom.

747
00:51:03,006 --> 00:51:06,942
- You mean, she's spying on us?
- Or somebody's doing it for her.

748
00:51:07,777 --> 00:51:10,769
- Come on.
- What are you doing?

749
00:51:10,847 --> 00:51:13,645
Taking a moonlit walk
with a beautiful girl.

750
00:51:14,985 --> 00:51:17,078
It's a long way back to campus.

751
00:51:17,154 --> 00:51:20,214
We just crash landed on a broom
that grew a forked tongue.

752
00:51:20,290 --> 00:51:21,621
How can you be so calm?

753
00:51:21,691 --> 00:51:25,718
Having a near-death experience
is strangely comforting.

754
00:51:30,634 --> 00:51:34,936
As you know, next week
is a very special Halloween.

755
00:51:35,005 --> 00:51:38,907
The 1,000 year anniversary
of Halloweentown.

756
00:51:38,975 --> 00:51:42,843
The big celebration's gonna be
right here, at Witch University.

757
00:51:46,049 --> 00:51:50,748
May I just say
that I am just so privileged

758
00:51:50,820 --> 00:51:54,256
to be a citizen of this great big
magical world of ours.

759
00:51:54,324 --> 00:51:57,418
Oh, man,
I promised myself I wasn't gonna cry.

760
00:51:57,494 --> 00:51:59,223
- Ohh!
- Thank you.

761
00:51:59,296 --> 00:52:00,729
Here you go.

762
00:52:02,999 --> 00:52:04,967
Are you OK?

763
00:52:05,035 --> 00:52:09,199
Oh, yeah.
I just got swept off my feet last night.

764
00:52:09,272 --> 00:52:14,300
Sage, if you ever talk to that loser
again, I'm gonna cut you off. I swear.

765
00:52:14,377 --> 00:52:17,005
Why doesn't Marnie cast a spell
to stop Scarlett?

766
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:19,742
She can't.
It's the one power witches don't have.

767
00:52:19,816 --> 00:52:22,580
They can't completely control
somebody else.

768
00:52:22,652 --> 00:52:26,850
But the Sinister sisters' spell
is controlling Dylan.

769
00:52:26,923 --> 00:52:29,858
They can't make him do
something he'd never do.

770
00:52:29,926 --> 00:52:32,554
Their spell just amplified
Dylan's own desires.

771
00:52:32,629 --> 00:52:35,427
He's doing what he wants to,
he just can't stop.

772
00:52:38,702 --> 00:52:40,397
I can't watch.

773
00:52:40,470 --> 00:52:44,907
The smallest thing we ever ate in my
family was a goat. Who wants to be

774
00:52:44,975 --> 00:52:46,966
the first volunteer?

775
00:52:47,043 --> 00:52:49,511
Uh... Marnie Piper,
come on up here, girl.

776
00:52:49,579 --> 00:52:52,514
- Come on, Marnie.
- Yeah, Marnie!

777
00:52:55,752 --> 00:52:58,414
- So good to see you.
- Drooling.

778
00:53:00,724 --> 00:53:01,884
Sorry.

779
00:53:04,060 --> 00:53:07,996
Perhaps we've been unclear.
Do you girls realize what's at stake?

780
00:53:08,064 --> 00:53:09,895
Personally, I'm a little fuzzy.

781
00:53:09,966 --> 00:53:12,332
We have only a few days until Halloween.

782
00:53:13,236 --> 00:53:16,603
If you can get Marnie Piper
to assume the Cromwell Gift,

783
00:53:16,673 --> 00:53:19,904
we, my lovely daughters,
and the witches of the Dominion,

784
00:53:19,976 --> 00:53:23,434
will use her power
to rule Halloweentown.

785
00:53:25,048 --> 00:53:26,675
- But...
- No buts.

786
00:53:26,750 --> 00:53:30,117
We must get her to open the box
and assume her Gift.

787
00:53:30,186 --> 00:53:32,620
We're trying. Seriously.

788
00:53:32,689 --> 00:53:35,783
Then we need to try harder.
Seriously.

789
00:53:40,563 --> 00:53:43,396
We dug all these things up
with our bare hands.

790
00:53:44,267 --> 00:53:46,565
Totally breaked our manicures.

791
00:53:47,804 --> 00:53:49,863
- I tore a cuticle.
- Are you OK?

792
00:53:54,477 --> 00:53:55,910
Are you sure about this?

793
00:53:55,979 --> 00:53:57,640
We've tried everything else.

794
00:53:57,714 --> 00:54:00,615
If she thinks
she's doing something noble,

795
00:54:00,684 --> 00:54:02,311
she'll do anything we ask.

796
00:54:02,385 --> 00:54:04,649
What a wonderful presentation.

797
00:54:04,721 --> 00:54:07,383
A- plus, my dears. A-plus.

798
00:54:07,457 --> 00:54:09,982
- Can we make her open it?
- Our time is up.

799
00:54:10,060 --> 00:54:13,552
Something to look forward to
for next time. Class dismissed.

800
00:54:18,168 --> 00:54:20,398
I bet Dillie dug that scroll up for you.

801
00:54:21,037 --> 00:54:24,370
Just like he took your psych exam
and wrote your physics paper.

802
00:54:24,441 --> 00:54:26,932
Marnie Piper, please stay.

803
00:54:27,010 --> 00:54:31,538
What now? I didn't bring up that thing
from the dirt and neither did Scarlett.

804
00:54:31,614 --> 00:54:34,082
Did you see her fingernails?
They're perfect.

805
00:54:34,150 --> 00:54:37,381
Those... Those Sinister sisters
use magic all the time,

806
00:54:37,454 --> 00:54:39,183
but do they get expelled? No.

807
00:54:39,255 --> 00:54:42,691
They get, "A-plus-plus, my dears,"
and that's just wrong.

808
00:54:42,759 --> 00:54:45,193
- You're right.
- I am right.

809
00:54:45,261 --> 00:54:47,456
- I'm right?
- Yes.

810
00:54:47,530 --> 00:54:50,658
And, I promise you,
I'll deal with them soon.

811
00:54:50,734 --> 00:54:53,862
But right now we have something
much more important at stake.

812
00:54:53,937 --> 00:54:56,667
Something only you can help us with.

813
00:54:56,740 --> 00:54:58,765
- Really?
- Open it.

814
00:55:08,118 --> 00:55:10,643
- I don't understand.
- You're special, Marnie.

815
00:55:11,421 --> 00:55:13,389
- Well...
- Upon this scroll

816
00:55:13,456 --> 00:55:15,856
is an ancient Halloweentown prophecy.

817
00:55:15,925 --> 00:55:20,419
It speaks of a powerful Cromwell who
will bring peace to our world forever.

818
00:55:21,398 --> 00:55:25,494
- And you think that's me?
- Marnie, not all magic is good magic.

819
00:55:25,568 --> 00:55:28,401
There are dark forces at work
in Halloweentown.

820
00:55:28,471 --> 00:55:30,996
On Halloween night,
here at Witch University,

821
00:55:31,074 --> 00:55:34,703
dark forces will try to shatter
the peace and tranquility

822
00:55:34,778 --> 00:55:38,908
- of our millennial celebration.
- You alone can save our world.

823
00:55:41,518 --> 00:55:44,976
Fulfill your destiny, Marnie.
Find the key to this box.

824
00:55:45,054 --> 00:55:46,919
Embrace your Gift.

825
00:55:46,990 --> 00:55:50,016
And Halloweentown
will continue to exist in peace.

826
00:55:50,093 --> 00:55:51,424
Wow.

827
00:55:51,494 --> 00:55:53,394
No pressure or anything.

828
00:55:55,298 --> 00:55:58,927
Now go and trust no one.

829
00:56:11,948 --> 00:56:13,677
Hello, boys.

830
00:56:13,750 --> 00:56:17,015
Now, I know that you've been
spying on Marnie Piper.

831
00:56:18,354 --> 00:56:23,690
I just need to know who has been
paying you for your services and why.

832
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:24,954
Spill it...

833
00:56:25,028 --> 00:56:27,895
...and these babies are all yours.

834
00:56:34,704 --> 00:56:37,002
- Marnie.
- I have to talk to Dylan.

835
00:56:37,574 --> 00:56:39,838
Just stop for one second.

836
00:56:39,909 --> 00:56:43,538
If he's still under Scarlett's spell
he won't want to talk to me.

837
00:56:45,548 --> 00:56:47,106
Fine. I'll try.

838
00:56:49,519 --> 00:56:52,010
Dylan, it's Ethan.
Dude, open up.

839
00:56:54,791 --> 00:56:56,190
Dude.

840
00:56:57,760 --> 00:56:59,990
- What is going on?
- Four papers, two exams,

841
00:57:00,063 --> 00:57:02,588
three book reports and a speech
with visual aids.

842
00:57:02,665 --> 00:57:04,758
- I gotta get back to work.
- Of course.

843
00:57:04,834 --> 00:57:07,462
- Don't try to stop me.
- Wouldn't dream of it.

844
00:57:07,537 --> 00:57:09,402
I can't disappoint Scarlett.

845
00:57:09,472 --> 00:57:11,872
Or Sage. Or Sapphire.

846
00:57:11,941 --> 00:57:14,307
What is that?

847
00:57:14,377 --> 00:57:15,969
My mother.

848
00:57:19,315 --> 00:57:21,306
Marnie. Where's Dylan?

849
00:57:21,384 --> 00:57:24,012
- Studying his brains out.
- Oh, good.

850
00:57:24,087 --> 00:57:27,386
- Are you OK?
- Everything's going to be fine, Mom.

851
00:57:27,457 --> 00:57:30,790
- Going to be fine? What does going...?
- We're fine, Mom.

852
00:57:30,860 --> 00:57:33,522
Call it mother's intuition
or witch's worry,

853
00:57:33,596 --> 00:57:38,693
but I realize it was a bad idea sending
you two off alone to Halloweentown.

854
00:57:38,768 --> 00:57:41,635
- Mom.
- Maybe I could pop in for a visit.

855
00:57:41,704 --> 00:57:44,673
- No. Why?
- Because I want to see you.

856
00:57:44,741 --> 00:57:48,472
- Why can't I come and visit?
- You can't trust me for one second?

857
00:57:48,545 --> 00:57:50,843
- That is not true.
- Other people trust me.

858
00:57:50,914 --> 00:57:55,248
In fact, they rely on me. My professors,
Dr. Goodwyn, even that fossil, Grogg.

859
00:57:55,318 --> 00:57:58,344
They think I'm destined
for greatness. They believe in me.

860
00:57:58,421 --> 00:58:00,480
- I believe in you.
- I gotta go, Mom.

861
00:58:02,926 --> 00:58:06,589
I miss you!

862
00:58:08,197 --> 00:58:12,497
The birdies. They've all flown away.

863
00:58:13,670 --> 00:58:15,501
I just hope they come back soon.

864
00:58:18,575 --> 00:58:22,067
We can't just
leave him like this. We need help.

865
00:58:22,145 --> 00:58:25,444
- Where are you going?
- To get another witch so there's three.

866
00:58:25,515 --> 00:58:28,006
- We can do this.
- No, we can't.

867
00:58:28,084 --> 00:58:32,020
I know it's against the rules, and we
could get expelled, but this is Dylan.

868
00:58:32,088 --> 00:58:34,579
Marnie, I can't help you.

869
00:58:34,657 --> 00:58:37,888
- Can't or you won't?
- Marnie, it's complicated.

870
00:58:37,961 --> 00:58:39,519
No, it's not. It's simple.

871
00:58:39,596 --> 00:58:41,860
I thought you were my friend.

872
00:58:41,931 --> 00:58:43,592
Marnie, they're using you.

873
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:45,865
Grogg and Goodwyn.

874
00:58:47,136 --> 00:58:49,696
They're part of a secret club
my dad belonged to.

875
00:58:49,772 --> 00:58:53,435
They're these seven witches
who call themselves the Dominion.

876
00:58:53,509 --> 00:58:57,240
They're plotting to use you and
your magic to take over Halloweentown

877
00:58:57,313 --> 00:58:59,611
and make slaves
out of all the other creatures.

878
00:59:01,150 --> 00:59:03,050
They want to rule Halloweentown.

879
00:59:04,554 --> 00:59:06,021
No, you're wrong.

880
00:59:06,089 --> 00:59:08,956
They're the good guys.
Unlike you, Ethan.

881
00:59:25,541 --> 00:59:29,373
Professor Periwinkle, thank you so much
for meeting me off campus.

882
00:59:29,445 --> 00:59:32,710
I just... I needed us to be alone.
I have to talk to Splendora.

883
00:59:32,782 --> 00:59:35,945
And I need your help
to travel back in time.

884
00:59:36,019 --> 00:59:39,284
- Talk to her about what?
- About this ancient prophecy

885
00:59:39,355 --> 00:59:41,550
and this silver box and dark forces.

886
00:59:41,624 --> 00:59:43,785
- And the future of Halloweentown.
- Yes.

887
00:59:43,860 --> 00:59:46,021
- Then you are ready.
- I think so.

888
00:59:46,095 --> 00:59:48,723
I just don't trust anyone else
to help me.

889
00:59:48,798 --> 00:59:52,928
I know time travel is some serious magic
and I don't want to get you in trouble.

890
00:59:53,002 --> 00:59:56,301
Fiddlesticks.
I live for trouble, deary.

891
00:59:57,707 --> 00:59:59,299
Shall we?

892
01:00:06,983 --> 01:00:08,610
Good luck, Marnie.

893
01:00:23,366 --> 01:00:26,335
OK. Right place.
Hopefully it's the right time.

894
01:00:26,402 --> 01:00:29,667
Excuse me.

895
01:00:33,076 --> 01:00:37,012
- Benny?
- Benjamin C. Deadman, at your service.

896
01:00:37,080 --> 01:00:40,140
But Benny does
have a nice ring to it, now.

897
01:00:40,216 --> 01:00:43,208
I'm looking for a witch
named Splendora Cromwell.

898
01:00:43,286 --> 01:00:45,618
In truth?
You know the great lady?

899
01:00:45,688 --> 01:00:49,283
Absolutely.
Can you give me a ride?

900
01:00:49,358 --> 01:00:51,952
Do I seem like
some sort of taxi service to you?

901
01:00:52,028 --> 01:00:54,588
- Not yet, but you will.
- Fortune teller, huh?

902
01:00:56,132 --> 01:00:58,123
Hop on.

903
01:01:01,871 --> 01:01:04,635
What does a skeleton say
before he eats?

904
01:01:04,707 --> 01:01:06,971
Bone appetit!

905
01:01:07,043 --> 01:01:10,774
A thousand years to work
on those jokes and they still stink.

906
01:01:15,151 --> 01:01:19,212
Cromwell Castle, miss.
Home of the great Splendora Cromwell.

907
01:01:23,259 --> 01:01:26,023
Enjoy your stay in Halloweentown.

908
01:01:27,730 --> 01:01:29,027
Thanks, Benny.

909
01:01:29,732 --> 01:01:33,896
Hurry up!

910
01:01:40,143 --> 01:01:42,270
This is Halloweentown?

911
01:01:55,191 --> 01:01:58,285
Buy some fresh fruit
for the poor nation.

912
01:02:01,364 --> 01:02:04,925
- Careful, Periwinkle.
- Fiddlesticks.

913
01:02:10,373 --> 01:02:13,206
- Professor Periwinkle?
- Professor!

914
01:02:13,943 --> 01:02:16,776
Name's Persimmon, miss.
Just a poor fruitmonger.

915
01:02:16,846 --> 01:02:18,973
Don't know no professor now, but...

916
01:02:19,048 --> 01:02:22,142
I'm not like some
of the uneducated dolts round here.

917
01:02:22,218 --> 01:02:25,153
- I can read.
- I know. You teach Shakespeare.

918
01:02:25,221 --> 01:02:27,689
- Who?
- Oh, yeah. He hasn't been born yet.

919
01:02:29,192 --> 01:02:34,152
I need your help. I need to find
my cousin, Splendora Cromwell.

920
01:02:37,667 --> 01:02:41,330
Future queen of Halloweentown's
getting ready for her coronation.

921
01:02:41,404 --> 01:02:45,067
Halloweentown, our future queen!

922
01:02:51,814 --> 01:02:53,805
Queen Splendora.

923
01:02:56,419 --> 01:03:00,515
- Wow. She's... She's...
- She looks just like you.

924
01:03:02,625 --> 01:03:05,822
Splendora, we need to talk.

925
01:03:05,895 --> 01:03:08,420
Look, I just need a minute.

926
01:03:20,676 --> 01:03:23,270
Strange magic, this.

927
01:03:24,146 --> 01:03:28,207
She has the appearance of the queen,
but she smells of mortal.

928
01:03:28,284 --> 01:03:30,081
Smite her.

929
01:03:30,853 --> 01:03:33,947
No. No smiting. I need her help.

930
01:03:38,995 --> 01:03:41,054
Be gone!

931
01:03:43,232 --> 01:03:46,065
I said no smiting.
And no throwing in the hoosegow.

932
01:03:53,142 --> 01:03:56,600
- Psst.
- Professor Periwinkle!

933
01:03:57,747 --> 01:04:00,716
- What's going on?
- Splendora locked herself in her room,

934
01:04:00,783 --> 01:04:03,343
and will not show herself
for the coronation.

935
01:04:03,419 --> 01:04:04,943
- Which room?
- Her bedroom.

936
01:04:05,488 --> 01:04:08,218
In the tower there.

937
01:04:08,858 --> 01:04:10,758
I know just where that is.

938
01:04:11,494 --> 01:04:13,359
Help me.

939
01:04:13,429 --> 01:04:15,260
Aviatus.

940
01:04:18,834 --> 01:04:20,825
You forgot your cloak!

941
01:04:21,504 --> 01:04:23,028
Fiddlesticks.

942
01:04:27,877 --> 01:04:29,868
Splendora's room is my dorm?

943
01:04:30,579 --> 01:04:33,980
Wow. I wonder what they give you
when you're a sophomore.

944
01:04:37,987 --> 01:04:39,420
There it is.

945
01:04:45,761 --> 01:04:47,228
Key. Where's the key?

946
01:05:04,613 --> 01:05:06,046
She hasn't used the box.

947
01:05:06,649 --> 01:05:08,378
Splendora still has the Gift.

948
01:05:08,451 --> 01:05:11,113
Whether she wants it or not.

949
01:05:13,456 --> 01:05:15,481
You must be of my family.

950
01:05:15,558 --> 01:05:19,153
I put a enchantment of protection
upon this room and everything in it.

951
01:05:19,228 --> 01:05:21,355
Only a Cromwell would be allowed inside.

952
01:05:21,430 --> 01:05:23,022
I am a Cromwell.

953
01:05:23,532 --> 01:05:24,931
Indeed.

954
01:05:25,001 --> 01:05:26,935
How is it we have never met?

955
01:05:27,003 --> 01:05:30,530
- I'm from the future.
- Oh. Indeed.

956
01:05:31,707 --> 01:05:35,768
- That would explain the clothes.
- We can't all have a royal dresser.

957
01:05:36,545 --> 01:05:40,606
Look, I'm here because I need whatever
it is you're about to lock in that box.

958
01:05:40,683 --> 01:05:43,516
Do you speak of this?

959
01:05:43,586 --> 01:05:45,053
That's the Gift?

960
01:05:45,121 --> 01:05:47,589
This amulet was handed down to me
by my mother.

961
01:05:47,656 --> 01:05:50,989
And her mother before her,
and so back to the beginning of time.

962
01:05:51,060 --> 01:05:55,429
The Cromwell who wears this 'tis indeed
gifted with a very special old power.

963
01:05:55,498 --> 01:05:58,695
- Power I would not wish upon anyone.
- You could so wish it on me.

964
01:05:58,768 --> 01:06:01,362
Do you understand
what this great power is?

965
01:06:01,437 --> 01:06:03,200
No, not exactly.

966
01:06:03,272 --> 01:06:08,437
Mark this. In this amulet
is the power of absolute control.

967
01:06:08,511 --> 01:06:11,446
With it I can will anyone
to do anything.

968
01:06:11,514 --> 01:06:16,451
- I can control hearts and minds.
- And you don't want that?

969
01:06:16,519 --> 01:06:18,885
Our powers are to be used for good,
to help people.

970
01:06:19,855 --> 01:06:23,018
Halloweentown is a refuge
for all kinds of magical creatures.

971
01:06:23,092 --> 01:06:26,493
Those seven witches call themselves
the Dominion for a reason.

972
01:06:26,562 --> 01:06:28,530
They want to use me and my Gift.

973
01:06:29,065 --> 01:06:32,899
To rule Halloweentown
and turn everyone else into slaves!

974
01:06:32,968 --> 01:06:34,663
Ethan was telling the truth.

975
01:06:34,737 --> 01:06:38,503
'Tis truly sad when a few people
force their views on everyone else.

976
01:06:38,574 --> 01:06:41,441
- My mom says that.
- Then she is wise.

977
01:06:42,445 --> 01:06:45,243
Tonight they will crown me
their queen and...

978
01:06:45,314 --> 01:06:47,248
I do not wish to be queen!

979
01:06:47,316 --> 01:06:51,309
Even my father said King Arthur
hated the whole royalty thing.

980
01:06:51,387 --> 01:06:54,151
- Your father knew King Arthur?
- In truth.

981
01:06:54,223 --> 01:06:56,555
- Was your father Merlin?
- No.

982
01:06:56,625 --> 01:06:58,058
Marvin. Merlin's cousin.

983
01:07:01,297 --> 01:07:03,891
- Splendora!
- I have made my decision.

984
01:07:03,966 --> 01:07:05,729
- Come out here now!
- Tonight,

985
01:07:05,801 --> 01:07:08,235
I will lock away
this terrible power forever.

986
01:07:08,304 --> 01:07:12,297
OK. I totally understand,
but before you do that,

987
01:07:12,374 --> 01:07:14,399
- could I just borrow it real quick?
- No!

988
01:07:14,477 --> 01:07:16,069
- Why not?
- Because.

989
01:07:16,145 --> 01:07:19,706
- Man, you're selfish.
- Silence.

990
01:07:20,616 --> 01:07:22,208
Dance.

991
01:07:22,985 --> 01:07:25,476
Shake. Stop.

992
01:07:26,088 --> 01:07:27,919
Adore me.

993
01:07:29,492 --> 01:07:33,223
This Gift is a curse.
With one word I can make you my slave.

994
01:07:33,295 --> 01:07:36,890
This power could tempt
even a good witch to dark deeds.

995
01:07:36,966 --> 01:07:39,867
Splendora!

996
01:07:39,935 --> 01:07:44,770
You must come out.
We must prepare you for your coronation.

997
01:07:49,578 --> 01:07:51,273
Splendora!

998
01:07:51,347 --> 01:07:54,043
- Why don't you destroy the amulet?
- I cannot.

999
01:07:54,116 --> 01:07:56,414
Three Cromwell's created the amulet.

1000
01:07:56,986 --> 01:08:00,046
And only the power of three Cromwell's
will destroy it.

1001
01:08:00,122 --> 01:08:03,353
Splendora Agatha Cromwell!

1002
01:08:03,425 --> 01:08:05,916
- Did she just say Agatha?
- 'Tis my middle name.

1003
01:08:07,029 --> 01:08:08,621
I loathe the Splendora part.

1004
01:08:08,697 --> 01:08:12,463
When all this is over
I will become just plain Aggie Cromwell.

1005
01:08:12,535 --> 01:08:15,265
You're Aggie Cromwell?

1006
01:08:16,238 --> 01:08:18,206
You do have a future.

1007
01:08:18,874 --> 01:08:21,866
You'll have loyal friends,
just like that fruit lady.

1008
01:08:21,944 --> 01:08:24,811
And you'll be a great person
and a good witch.

1009
01:08:24,880 --> 01:08:27,747
And... And a beloved grandmother.

1010
01:08:27,816 --> 01:08:29,249
Grandmother?

1011
01:08:29,318 --> 01:08:32,344
- Whose grandmother?
- Mine.

1012
01:08:33,923 --> 01:08:37,825
Well, if you are my granddaughter,
then my future is bright, indeed.

1013
01:08:41,864 --> 01:08:45,459
Insolent girl! Guards!

1014
01:08:45,534 --> 01:08:46,831
Guards!

1015
01:08:48,170 --> 01:08:51,196
You two. You, you, now.

1016
01:08:51,273 --> 01:08:55,300
Get up to Splendora's room and bring her
out by whatever means necessary. Go!

1017
01:08:55,377 --> 01:08:56,901
Quickly!

1018
01:09:05,421 --> 01:09:07,889
There's only one safe place
to hide this key.

1019
01:09:10,559 --> 01:09:12,584
The future.

1020
01:09:13,629 --> 01:09:16,723
But you said the power
could turn even a good witch bad.

1021
01:09:16,799 --> 01:09:21,099
I trust you, Marnie. After all,
I'm going to train you myself.

1022
01:09:23,372 --> 01:09:26,068
Shall we?

1023
01:09:27,776 --> 01:09:29,835
See you in a thousand years, Grandma.

1024
01:09:30,579 --> 01:09:32,911
Oh. There's something you'll be needing.

1025
01:09:39,421 --> 01:09:41,321
Bye, Grandma.

1026
01:09:50,933 --> 01:09:53,697
Hello, boys.
Take this outside, will you?

1027
01:10:20,996 --> 01:10:23,123
Beautiful, isn't it?

1028
01:10:23,832 --> 01:10:28,030
Why don't you just let me hold onto that
so it doesn't fall into the wrong hands.

1029
01:10:28,103 --> 01:10:30,094
It's a Cromwell family heirloom.

1030
01:10:34,843 --> 01:10:37,539
I don't think you've been
very responsible, Marnie.

1031
01:10:37,613 --> 01:10:40,309
- Skipping all those classes.
- What?

1032
01:10:40,382 --> 01:10:43,078
You got here just in time.
It's Halloween.

1033
01:10:43,152 --> 01:10:45,416
I thought you needed me
to save Halloweentown.

1034
01:10:45,487 --> 01:10:50,151
- We do. In just a few hours.
- Why do you think I'll stick around?

1035
01:10:50,225 --> 01:10:53,422
You wouldn't leave here
without your brother, would you?

1036
01:10:56,265 --> 01:10:57,493
Dylan.

1037
01:10:58,867 --> 01:11:02,166
Marnie, my goodness.
Only a few hours until the party begins.

1038
01:11:02,237 --> 01:11:04,569
And I really need help
with the fondue cart.

1039
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:06,767
Drool check.
Have you seen my brother?

1040
01:11:06,842 --> 01:11:07,934
Nope.

1041
01:11:08,010 --> 01:11:10,911
Where have you been?
I've been looking everywhere.

1042
01:11:10,979 --> 01:11:14,938
Field trip.
Ethan, I'm so sorry.

1043
01:11:15,017 --> 01:11:18,145
You were right about the Dominion.
About everything.

1044
01:11:18,220 --> 01:11:21,621
- We need to find Dylan.
- I already did.

1045
01:11:41,377 --> 01:11:45,177
Daddy says after tonight this is what
the whole world will look like.

1046
01:11:45,247 --> 01:11:47,772
Us versus those things.

1047
01:11:51,220 --> 01:11:52,585
Having fun, Scarlett?

1048
01:11:53,288 --> 01:11:56,815
Not really. The service here stinks.

1049
01:12:00,262 --> 01:12:01,559
Pudding, Scarlett?

1050
01:12:04,133 --> 01:12:05,691
Whoa. Whoa!

1051
01:12:12,241 --> 01:12:15,142
- Why are you using him like this?
- We're not using him.

1052
01:12:15,210 --> 01:12:17,644
- We're using you.
- Whatever. It's over.

1053
01:12:17,713 --> 01:12:19,112
Not yet!

1054
01:12:33,662 --> 01:12:36,096
Fetch.

1055
01:12:39,101 --> 01:12:40,227
Dylan!

1056
01:12:40,302 --> 01:12:42,600
Wait, Dylan, stop!

1057
01:12:43,405 --> 01:12:45,236
Dylan! Dylan!

1058
01:12:45,307 --> 01:12:48,037
Come back here. Here, boy!
Dylan, no!

1059
01:12:49,812 --> 01:12:52,076
Dylan! Heel!

1060
01:12:52,147 --> 01:12:53,842
Dylan, come back here, boy.

1061
01:12:53,916 --> 01:12:55,474
Boy! Dylan!

1062
01:13:02,090 --> 01:13:03,751
Mom!

1063
01:13:03,826 --> 01:13:05,453
I need you.

1064
01:13:14,336 --> 01:13:17,794
I thought you'd never call.

1065
01:13:22,277 --> 01:13:25,906
- I really messed up.
- Well, we mess up sometimes.

1066
01:13:26,648 --> 01:13:28,172
That's how you learn.

1067
01:13:28,250 --> 01:13:31,845
Just this week I blew a big sale
by talking to a birdbath.

1068
01:13:33,188 --> 01:13:36,646
But here, at Witch University,
all mess-ups become permanent.

1069
01:13:36,725 --> 01:13:38,124
At midnight. I know.

1070
01:13:38,193 --> 01:13:39,956
I read the handbook.

1071
01:13:40,028 --> 01:13:43,555
- I thought I could do this alone.
- Well, I'm here now.

1072
01:13:43,632 --> 01:13:47,329
- And what do I always say?
- We're stronger together.

1073
01:14:00,949 --> 01:14:02,678
- Nice.
- Come on.

1074
01:14:06,321 --> 01:14:10,451
I wish there was something I could do.
The celebration's about to begin.

1075
01:14:10,526 --> 01:14:12,790
No one's seen
the Sinister girls or Dylan.

1076
01:14:12,861 --> 01:14:15,386
- Have you checked the pound?
- That is not funny.

1077
01:14:15,464 --> 01:14:18,991
- Ethan's out searching for him.
- Let me see this prophecy again.

1078
01:14:20,035 --> 01:14:23,198
OK, the first millennium,
Halloween moon...

1079
01:14:23,272 --> 01:14:26,537
- "Will find peace under her dominion. "
- The Dominion!

1080
01:14:26,608 --> 01:14:30,066
That's what they call themselves,
and Dr. Goodwyn is one of them.

1081
01:14:30,145 --> 01:14:34,104
I trusted her. All of this...
The nice dorm room, the scholarship.

1082
01:14:34,182 --> 01:14:38,141
- How could I have been so stupid?
- You are not stupid, Marnie.

1083
01:14:38,220 --> 01:14:39,778
You are 18.

1084
01:14:41,390 --> 01:14:43,950
- Do you have a witch's glass?
- Yeah.

1085
01:14:44,826 --> 01:14:47,056
Grandma gave it to me
so I could multitask.

1086
01:14:47,129 --> 01:14:49,723
OK. Let's use this and find Dylan.

1087
01:14:49,798 --> 01:14:52,460
Illumina obscuratio.

1088
01:14:55,437 --> 01:14:57,530
- Oh, Dylan.
- Where is he?

1089
01:14:57,606 --> 01:14:59,039
Oh.

1090
01:14:59,107 --> 01:15:00,802
What's that on the lock?

1091
01:15:01,443 --> 01:15:05,277
- It's an "S."
- As in "Sinister. "

1092
01:15:07,849 --> 01:15:09,077
What?

1093
01:15:09,151 --> 01:15:10,675
Marnie!

1094
01:15:16,892 --> 01:15:18,086
Dylan.

1095
01:15:18,160 --> 01:15:20,560
- Where did you find him?
- We had help.

1096
01:15:21,563 --> 01:15:22,825
Marnie, I'm sorry.

1097
01:15:22,898 --> 01:15:24,866
- You're working with them?
- No!

1098
01:15:24,933 --> 01:15:26,093
Oh, yes, he was.

1099
01:15:26,168 --> 01:15:28,636
He just didn't know it.

1100
01:15:28,704 --> 01:15:33,164
Ethan found your brother,
and we found Ethan.

1101
01:15:34,977 --> 01:15:37,241
- Let them go.
- Oh, I will.

1102
01:15:37,312 --> 01:15:40,543
As soon as Marnie agrees
to work with us.

1103
01:15:44,953 --> 01:15:47,922
- What do you want from me?
- It's quite simple.

1104
01:15:47,990 --> 01:15:50,049
Do what your silly grandmother
would not.

1105
01:15:50,125 --> 01:15:53,617
Wear the amulet.
Use the Cromwell Gift.

1106
01:15:53,695 --> 01:15:57,187
You mean turn all those
inferior creatures into slaves

1107
01:15:57,265 --> 01:15:59,130
so the Dominion can rule?

1108
01:15:59,201 --> 01:16:02,568
You make things sound
so sinister, Marnie.

1109
01:16:02,638 --> 01:16:04,435
We'll bring order to this place.

1110
01:16:04,506 --> 01:16:08,738
Together, we'll use the power
to make things run much more smoothly.

1111
01:16:08,810 --> 01:16:13,338
It will all be so much easier for
everyone when the Dominion is in charge.

1112
01:16:14,282 --> 01:16:16,807
- You want me for your queen?
- Only for one night.

1113
01:16:16,885 --> 01:16:19,046
- One night?
- Tonight, at the celebration,

1114
01:16:19,121 --> 01:16:21,487
you'll use the Gift to cast a spell,

1115
01:16:21,556 --> 01:16:24,889
establishing the rule of the Dominion
over Halloweentown.

1116
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:28,828
A spell which will, of course, become
permanent at the stroke of midnight.

1117
01:16:28,897 --> 01:16:33,391
- After that we won't need you anymore.
- Well, I won't do it.

1118
01:16:33,468 --> 01:16:34,901
Insolent girl.

1119
01:16:34,970 --> 01:16:38,770
Do you want your brother to lap water
from a toilet for the rest of his life?

1120
01:16:39,374 --> 01:16:41,774
All we have to do
is keep him that way till midnight,

1121
01:16:41,843 --> 01:16:46,746
and he will be
in the doghouse... permanently.

1122
01:16:49,685 --> 01:16:52,176
- Fine. I'll do it.
- Marnie.

1123
01:16:53,588 --> 01:16:56,284
But I'm going to need time
to get ready.

1124
01:16:56,358 --> 01:16:58,986
After all, a girl's only queen
for a night once.

1125
01:16:59,061 --> 01:17:02,121
I want my best friend, Aneesa,
to be my royal dresser.

1126
01:17:02,197 --> 01:17:05,496
I will hang out in her room,
do my hair, and I will wear a dress,

1127
01:17:05,567 --> 01:17:07,364
so I can act the part.

1128
01:17:17,212 --> 01:17:18,645
It is my wish.

1129
01:17:18,714 --> 01:17:21,512
Absolutely, my queen.

1130
01:17:21,583 --> 01:17:24,677
Ethan, make sure Dylan is
in the courtyard before midnight.

1131
01:17:26,221 --> 01:17:28,189
We'll be there.

1132
01:17:28,256 --> 01:17:30,349
Beam me up, genie.

1133
01:17:38,600 --> 01:17:40,363
Come on, Dylan.

1134
01:17:40,435 --> 01:17:42,130
We've got three minutes.

1135
01:17:42,204 --> 01:17:44,434
I know. It's gonna be fine.

1136
01:17:46,842 --> 01:17:48,810
- Do you see them anywhere?
- No.

1137
01:17:53,749 --> 01:17:55,046
Dylan!

1138
01:17:55,117 --> 01:17:57,142
Dylan! Hi, sweetie!

1139
01:17:57,886 --> 01:18:01,913
Oh! I promise you
we will get you out of this mess.

1140
01:18:22,444 --> 01:18:25,709
It's almost midnight.

1141
01:18:27,449 --> 01:18:30,009
Prepare to receive the Gift.

1142
01:18:30,085 --> 01:18:33,282
Change Dylan back now
or no deal.

1143
01:18:35,824 --> 01:18:38,224
Yes, my queen.

1144
01:18:38,293 --> 01:18:40,955
By the power of three!

1145
01:18:48,036 --> 01:18:49,435
Opposable thumbs.

1146
01:18:50,038 --> 01:18:51,699
- Thank you.
- Are you OK, honey?

1147
01:18:52,440 --> 01:18:55,375
I'm fine, Mom,
but I think I'll just sit.

1148
01:18:56,178 --> 01:18:58,305
- And stay.
- OK. Just don't roll over.

1149
01:18:58,380 --> 01:19:00,348
Not yet.

1150
01:19:00,949 --> 01:19:03,247
Marnie Piper,

1151
01:19:03,318 --> 01:19:07,254
granddaughter of
Splendora Agatha Cromwell,

1152
01:19:08,390 --> 01:19:11,757
Take on your Gift
and fulfill the prophecy.

1153
01:19:18,033 --> 01:19:22,595
After tonight you'll be free
to use your power as you wish.

1154
01:19:24,573 --> 01:19:28,168
You will be the greatest witch
in the world.

1155
01:19:28,877 --> 01:19:31,641
Isn't that what you've always wanted?

1156
01:19:31,713 --> 01:19:34,307
Isn't that why you came here?

1157
01:19:36,718 --> 01:19:38,185
Yes.

1158
01:19:38,954 --> 01:19:40,854
I am ready to receive the Gift.

1159
01:19:42,791 --> 01:19:46,852
Citizens of Halloweentown, behold.

1160
01:19:48,096 --> 01:19:51,691
I give you... your queen.

1161
01:19:58,240 --> 01:20:00,902
Queen Cromwell,

1162
01:20:01,776 --> 01:20:04,336
grace us with a display of your power.

1163
01:20:04,412 --> 01:20:06,346
Use your Gift.

1164
01:20:07,249 --> 01:20:11,049
Citizens of
Halloweentown, I now possess the power

1165
01:20:11,119 --> 01:20:14,145
to make you my slaves
and bend you to my will.

1166
01:20:15,523 --> 01:20:19,755
Exis imperium principia.

1167
01:20:19,828 --> 01:20:23,821
Yes, my queen!
Did I just say that?

1168
01:20:26,167 --> 01:20:29,261
By the power of the Dominion,
do as I command.

1169
01:20:30,372 --> 01:20:32,101
For you, my queen.

1170
01:20:33,875 --> 01:20:36,173
Now, Aneesa.

1171
01:20:53,461 --> 01:20:57,761
By the power of three I command you
to destroy the Gift forever.

1172
01:20:57,832 --> 01:20:59,390
No!

1173
01:21:05,640 --> 01:21:09,736
Extiendo aterus!

1174
01:21:27,862 --> 01:21:31,263
Happy Halloween!

1175
01:21:31,333 --> 01:21:33,858
Yeah.

1176
01:21:36,705 --> 01:21:39,469
Good job, boys.

1177
01:21:39,541 --> 01:21:41,702
This is ridiculous.

1178
01:21:41,776 --> 01:21:45,075
- Persimmon Periwinkle.
- It's Agent Periwinkle.

1179
01:21:45,146 --> 01:21:48,877
Of the Halloweentown
Anti-Dominion League.

1180
01:21:48,950 --> 01:21:50,042
Preposterous!

1181
01:21:50,118 --> 01:21:54,316
What's preposterous is how long
I've been undercover. Ten centuries!

1182
01:21:54,389 --> 01:21:58,052
You are all hereby stripped
of your magic powers

1183
01:21:58,126 --> 01:22:00,754
and are under arrest for treason!

1184
01:22:06,434 --> 01:22:09,232
Get me out of here!

1185
01:22:10,438 --> 01:22:12,998
So your Gift is gone forever.

1186
01:22:13,708 --> 01:22:15,107
No, it's not.

1187
01:22:15,176 --> 01:22:17,770
My gift is and always will be you.

1188
01:22:17,846 --> 01:22:18,904
Oh.

1189
01:22:19,948 --> 01:22:21,939
Man, this family is so mushy.

1190
01:22:23,551 --> 01:22:24,984
Just don't lick my face.

1191
01:22:31,860 --> 01:22:35,921
- Sorry about your lamp.
- I was gonna redecorate anyway.

1192
01:22:35,997 --> 01:22:38,795
You know, I'm looking for a roommate.

1193
01:22:38,867 --> 01:22:41,165
- Really?
- Yeah, I have a really big room.

1194
01:22:41,970 --> 01:22:44,438
It was originally built
for a queen, you know.

1195
01:22:44,506 --> 01:22:46,371
- Hey.
- Hey.

1196
01:22:47,609 --> 01:22:51,909
You know, I'd really hoped
you two had moved past monosyllables.

1197
01:22:53,181 --> 01:22:56,912
I think I'll go help...

1198
01:23:01,122 --> 01:23:04,489
What you did,
giving up that power...

1199
01:23:05,627 --> 01:23:07,754
You probably think it was stupid.

1200
01:23:07,829 --> 01:23:08,955
Stupid?

1201
01:23:09,831 --> 01:23:11,230
I think it's amazing.

1202
01:23:12,100 --> 01:23:13,795
Power isn't important to me.

1203
01:23:15,603 --> 01:23:17,798
What kind of warlock
doesn't like power?

1204
01:23:17,872 --> 01:23:19,999
The mortal kind.

1205
01:23:20,642 --> 01:23:23,406
When my dad tried to steal
your family's magic,

1206
01:23:23,478 --> 01:23:27,005
the Council took his powers
and I renounced mine.

1207
01:23:27,082 --> 01:23:30,745
I can't do magic,
I can't fly on a broom

1208
01:23:30,819 --> 01:23:32,844
or any other cleaning instrument.

1209
01:23:32,921 --> 01:23:37,153
Those flowers I gave you, that was just
a trick I learned from some book.

1210
01:23:39,060 --> 01:23:41,187
I'm a mortal now, Marnie.

1211
01:23:42,030 --> 01:23:44,590
I should have told you. I'm sorry.

1212
01:23:46,734 --> 01:23:49,259
Ethan Dalloway?

1213
01:23:49,337 --> 01:23:51,669
- Yep.
- What's up, man?

1214
01:23:51,739 --> 01:23:54,207
- He's mortal now.
- Oh.

1215
01:23:54,275 --> 01:23:57,438
I knew there was something I liked
about that kid.

1216
01:23:57,512 --> 01:23:59,810
Hey, Scarlett.

1217
01:24:01,015 --> 01:24:03,575
I, uh, think you owe
my boy, Dylan, an apology.

1218
01:24:03,651 --> 01:24:06,620
Excuse me? If anything,
he should apologize to me.

1219
01:24:06,688 --> 01:24:09,350
I wasted a whole month of college
on that toad.

1220
01:24:09,424 --> 01:24:13,360
Ooh. Join me in
a little Sinister magic, sisters?

1221
01:24:20,268 --> 01:24:23,396
My magic! It's gone!

1222
01:24:23,471 --> 01:24:27,771
Uh, yours, your father's,
your whole family's, actually.

1223
01:24:27,842 --> 01:24:30,402
- I don't get it.
- We're mortal, dumbbell!

1224
01:24:30,478 --> 01:24:32,969
We might as well be... ugly.

1225
01:24:37,852 --> 01:24:41,344
It is comforting to know
that you will have such good friends

1226
01:24:41,422 --> 01:24:44,755
- for the next four years.
- So you're saying I can stay?

1227
01:24:44,826 --> 01:24:46,794
Clearly, I don't control you.

1228
01:24:46,861 --> 01:24:50,763
Just promise me
that you will call home more often.

1229
01:24:50,832 --> 01:24:52,959
- I promise.
- OK.

1230
01:24:53,034 --> 01:24:54,934
I love you, Mom.

1231
01:25:06,948 --> 01:25:08,506
- Hey.
- Hey.

1232
01:25:22,230 --> 01:25:24,858
Mom? Are you watching them?

1233
01:25:24,933 --> 01:25:26,366
What? Oh, uh, no!

1234
01:25:26,434 --> 01:25:28,425
'Cause then, that would be spying.

1235
01:25:28,503 --> 01:25:30,733
- Something on your mind?
- Yeah.

1236
01:25:31,573 --> 01:25:33,040
The amulet.

1237
01:25:33,107 --> 01:25:35,769
I can't believe
Marnie actually destroyed it.

1238
01:25:35,843 --> 01:25:37,708
Well, you saw the fireworks.

1239
01:25:37,779 --> 01:25:40,077
But it was a precious Cromwell heirloom.

1240
01:25:40,148 --> 01:25:43,811
- It belonged to Grandma Aggie.
- And knowing Marnie,

1241
01:25:43,885 --> 01:25:47,878
she probably would have done
something more interesting with it.

1242
01:25:47,956 --> 01:25:49,548
Like what? Hid it someplace?

1243
01:25:49,624 --> 01:25:53,219
Or gave it to someone
that she trusts absolutely.

1244
01:26:21,923 --> 01:26:23,151
Oh, boy.
