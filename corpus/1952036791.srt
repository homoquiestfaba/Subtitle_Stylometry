1
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:53,735
Hello?

2
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,896
Yuka? How's it going?

3
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:57,692
Good. I'm just getting everything
out of the boxes.

4
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:00,451
Sorry I couldn't help today.

5
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:03,818
No, that's all right. You're the one
who's had a rough day.

6
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:06,454
It must be hard.
Is the funeral over?

7
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:08,373
Yeah, it just finished.

8
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:11,813
Grandma's safely
on her way to heaven.

9
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:14,013
I'm heading straight to your place,
still in my funeral suit!

10
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:17,016
Okay. I'll be waiting.

11
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:33,174
BLUE PALACE HIRAOKA

12
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:34,938
Good evening.

13
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:37,370
What?
What's the matter?

14
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:53,733
Hey! Yuka!
What are you doing?! Don't!

15
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:02,292
- No! Help!
- Don't! Yuka!

16
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:23,529
We're here!

17
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:34,014
Wow!
What a great building!

18
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:48,733
Hey, there's a pool!
Great!

19
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:05,578
THE MOVING SCHEDULE

20
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:07,850
Don't! Stop it!

21
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:14,735
Kenichiro!
Play this song next.

22
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:19,696
- Let's have a barbecue on the beach!
- A barbecue! That's a great idea!

23
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:22,736
Yeah! A barbecue.

24
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:26,816
Hello?
Oh, sis!

25
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,176
Yeah, that's right.

26
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:31,894
What? I'm fine.

27
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,215
Big sister's checking up on her.

28
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:37,698
How's Mom?
She is?

29
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:41,053
Look after her, sis, okay?

30
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:43,416
Oh, sis.

31
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:46,696
I love you!
See you.

32
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:51,769
Sayaka.
What did Mariko have to say?

33
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,768
Not to go too crazy
when I've just moved in.

34
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:57,255
My sister is such a drag!

35
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:59,976
Maybe she's jealous
that her little sister's moved

36
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:01,533
into a place as nice as this.

37
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:04,095
She's going to be living alone
with your mother, isn't she?

38
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:08,136
Yeah. But you know, isn't it weird
that the rent for a great place

39
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:10,137
like this is so cheap?

40
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:15,255
- It is weird! We could pay double.
- I agree.

41
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:20,012
- Sayaka, are you sure this is okay?
- What do you mean, "Okay"?

42
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:24,096
This is what she means.

43
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:32,536
Uh-oh.
You're not mad, are you?

44
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:35,652
Sorry.
It was a bad joke.

45
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,172
No.

46
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:43,816
Ouch!

47
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:48,568
As a matter of fact,
that's exactly what it is.

48
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:51,528
What do you mean,
that's what it is?

49
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:58,296
They say this building is famous...
for ghosts.

50
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:00,936
Ghosts?!

51
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:03,296
That's right.

52
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:09,018
It's, like, they say there's a woman
with long hair in a kimono

53
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:12,735
who stands in the elevator hall...

54
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:17,655
then when anyone comes up
in front of the elevator...

55
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:21,813
the woman in the kimono says this...

56
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:28,451
Is this the 13th floor?

57
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:45,014
- And then when you say...
- Yes, this is the 13th floor.

58
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:51,691
And you're about to get on
the elevator, suddenly...

59
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,256
and then she says this...

60
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:02,497
"Give me back my eyes."

61
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:11,929
What?
What does she say?

62
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:14,896
What does she say?

63
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:25,899
My eyes...

64
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:29,971
My eyes...

65
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,656
give them back!

66
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:37,536
I got you!

67
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:42,648
Yo, you're the most scared
of them all.

68
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:47,368
So went the story
that was on TV the other night. Ta-da!

69
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:49,730
Wha-aat?!

70
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:52,659
You sure had me going!

71
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:56,169
Anyway, it's got a great view, but it's
a long way from the train station

72
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:57,654
and there aren't many buses
on this route,

73
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:59,816
so there's hardly anyone
who wants to rent this place,

74
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:01,248
is what the real-estate agent said.

75
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:08,897
Kenichiro, change the music,
will you?

76
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:12,136
That one scares me!

77
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:16,572
Yo was more scared than anyone.
Get it together, dude!

78
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:18,736
Yeah, you're a disgrace, Yo.

79
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:20,009
Huh?
Where's Samantha?

80
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:22,973
Yeah, I thought
she went to the bathroom,

81
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:25,410
but she hasn't come back,
has she?

82
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:31,769
Samantha?

83
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:41,496
Samantha?

84
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:53,536
Samantha?

85
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:02,054
Samantha,
what are you doing in here?

86
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:14,015
What's the matter, Samantha?

87
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:23,212
Hey, Sayaka, don't you
smell something weird?

88
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:29,292
Yeah, I do.
What a stink!

89
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:33,180
Come on, time to eat.
Food!

90
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:10,294
- Where was she?
- The tatami room.

91
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:15,932
- Where's Sayaka?
- Over there.

92
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:37,570
Sayaka, what are you doing?

93
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:45,810
Sayaka, cut it out, will you?

94
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:54,016
Hey... Sayaka?

95
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:15,696
What's the matter with you?

96
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:18,096
Sayaka?

97
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:29,256
Sayaka?

98
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:31,816
What are you doing?

99
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:36,650
Well,

100
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:41,137
I don't want my face to get
all smashed up, you know.

101
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:43,896
What?

102
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:47,816
Hey, Sayaka...

103
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:53,976
Sayaka!

104
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:29,216
Another one fell, huh?

105
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:37,773
This must be hard
for you too, lwata.

106
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:41,050
I'm sorry you've been
put through all this.

107
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:50,933
It must have been a real shock
to all of you.

108
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:54,450
It happened right in front of you,
after all.

109
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:35,814
- It wasn't suicide.
- What?

110
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:39,449
Sayaka commit suicide?

111
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:42,850
Lt'd never happen!

112
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:48,656
Sayaka would never...

113
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:54,337
she'd never kill herself.

114
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:59,176
Don't!

115
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:11,136
Sayaka was looking at me.
While she was falling...

116
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:15,338
she was looking straight at me.

117
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:19,014
The poor girl...

118
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:34,336
Sayaka!

119
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:42,496
Sis...

120
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:52,057
Mom pushed me.

121
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:46,139
Mother, how long
is this going to go on?

122
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:49,855
Mother!
Snap out of it, will you?

123
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:54,610
Sayaka...

124
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:05,978
- What?
- Mariko, you're always like this.

125
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:09,852
Aren't you sad that Sayaka's dead?

126
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:19,212
What are you talking about?
What a horrible thing to say!

127
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,656
Of course I'm sad!

128
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:25,569
Why did it have to be her?
Why did it have to be her?

129
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:28,449
Why her?
Why isn't she here?!

130
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:31,094
Come on, Mother, please!

131
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:35,255
Come on, please.

132
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:52,930
Well, you'd better get going. You don't
want to keep everyone waiting.

133
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:55,776
Thanks.

134
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:05,932
Sayaka, phone as soon
as you get there.

135
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:10,176
Yeah.
Okay then, bye.

136
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:25,411
Sayaka...

137
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:32,499
why would you do a stupid thing
like that?

138
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:22,776
You didn't smoke, did you?

139
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:05,256
That's a cute teddy bear.

140
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:13,857
It was the big sister's from next door.

141
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:07,374
THE MOVING SCHEDULE

142
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,736
Here.

143
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:16,775
- What's this?
- A moving schedule.

144
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:19,694
Follow it and you'll get everything
done faster.

145
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:24,496
That's one thing I'll say about you,
sis, you really handle details well.

146
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:28,017
You'll make some man
a fine wife someday.

147
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:45,414
Oh, damn.
Sis, I'm going to cry!

148
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:49,819
Oh, come on!
What are you talking about?

149
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:51,976
You don't have time for crying.

150
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:45,096
Ow!

151
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:03,489
Did she have earrings like this?

152
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:14,131
UNKNOWN CALLER

153
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:34,014
Ken!
The real-estate office just called!

154
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:36,211
I got the apartment.

155
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:42,134
They said the person ahead of me
had come in and canceled.

156
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:44,934
It's hard to believe,
but I'm really lucky!

157
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:49,296
Canceled?

158
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:55,617
I just signed the contract.
What am I going to do?

159
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:58,414
I'll be living alone for the first time.

160
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:03,488
I found teddy! The poor thing
was stuck away in the closet.

161
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:10,573
I've decided we're going to
live together!

162
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:19,776
But that's...

163
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:38,296
Hello.

164
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:41,656
Your mother's out?

165
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:45,776
Is that so?

166
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:00,851
Do you know about what time
she might be home?

167
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:07,370
You're taking care of the place
all alone till then?

168
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:09,536
That's very brave.

169
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:17,174
You said the big sister
in the next apartment

170
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:19,735
gave you that teddy bear,
didn't you?

171
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:22,336
Do you remember when?

172
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:32,336
Aren't you scared?

173
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:35,408
Sorry?

174
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:37,975
Aren't you scared of that apartment?

175
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:40,136
Why?

176
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:46,449
All the women next door
died, you know.

177
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:51,456
Why?

178
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:38,212
Yeah, I'll stay here cleaning up
her stuff tonight.

179
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:43,976
I have to be here tomorrow when they
come to take out the furniture.

180
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:50,171
Well, yeah, but I'm tired, too.

181
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:54,812
Mother, stop just thinking of yourself
all the time, will you?

182
00:31:57,340 --> 00:31:59,729
Oh, the police gave me
her phone back.

183
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:02,659
They said they didn't need it anymore.

184
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:08,739
Yes, they're calling it a suicide.

185
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:14,619
Okay, bye.
You get some sleep, all right?

186
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:37,536
Sayaka!

187
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:46,493
Sayaka, is there something
you want to tell me?

188
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,456
Sayaka...

189
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:53,929
The Kanto region was shaken by an
earthquake at around 2:40 a.m.

190
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:56,576
The epicenter was below Tokyo Bay,

191
00:39:56,780 --> 00:39:58,657
and it had a magnitude
of 4.6 on the Richter scale.

192
00:39:58,860 --> 00:39:59,815
An earthquake?

193
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:04,536
On the Japanese scale, it registered
four in western Kanagawa Prefecture.

194
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:07,732
Is that all?

195
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:40,611
That looks fine.

196
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:49,450
I'll take the key then.

197
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:01,136
Thank you.

198
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:04,252
Um...

199
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:06,815
Yes?
Is there anything else?

200
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:15,375
No.
Sorry to trouble you.

201
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:19,653
This wasn't my sister's. Could I ask
you to take it away for me?

202
00:43:05,180 --> 00:43:06,977
Take good care of the teddy bear,
will you?

203
00:43:07,180 --> 00:43:10,297
My little sister treasured it.

204
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:16,739
The big sister who gave me this
is still next door, you know.

205
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:21,053
What do you mean?

206
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:15,370

July 18th: Midorigawa Sayaka, 21,

210
00:44:44,300 --> 00:44:49,249
jumped from balcony, suicide

211
00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:58,059
Last year, September 21st:
Kawabara Yuka, 21,

212
00:44:58,260 --> 00:45:03,618
jumped from balcony, suicide

213
00:45:05,660 --> 00:45:07,776
Last year, February 15th:
Masuda Sanae, 24,

214
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:09,493
committed suicide
by jumping from balcony

215
00:45:09,700 --> 00:45:11,053
Two years ago, November 30th
Endo Michiru, 26, committed suicide

216
00:45:11,260 --> 00:45:13,091
by jumping from balcony

217
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:17,691
Two years ago, May 15th: Sugiuchi
Yukiyo, 29, committed suicide.

218
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:20,972
So your sister is the fifth?

219
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:29,495
This might take a while to explain.
Do you have time?

Left in Apartment of Woman Suicide

Mother's body found
in woman's home

223
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:43,849
Mummified Mummy!

224
00:45:44,060 --> 00:45:45,698
The tragic tale of a mother
and daughter in a seaside condo

225
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:47,811
Daughter jumps to death
from thirteenth floor

226
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:04,813
Did this mother and daughter
live in that apartment?

227
00:46:06,260 --> 00:46:08,216
That's correct.

228
00:46:11,780 --> 00:46:14,533
After Sugiuchi Yukiyo died,
the body of her mother,

229
00:46:14,740 --> 00:46:18,096
Sugiuchi Sachiko, was found
in a closet in the tatami room.

230
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:21,736
The body had been there for six
months since the woman had died.

231
00:46:23,740 --> 00:46:25,696
In the closet?

232
00:46:28,060 --> 00:46:30,893
The story's a real tragedy.

233
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:35,288
Several books came out
about it afterwards.

234
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:42,212
It would appear that Yukiyo had
always been abused by her mother.

235
00:46:49,020 --> 00:46:52,012
She wasn't a heavy-on-the-makeup
kind of woman.

236
00:46:52,220 --> 00:46:56,213
She was very quiet,
and her clothes were real drab.

237
00:46:56,420 --> 00:46:59,730
As soon as work was done,
she'd head straight home.

238
00:46:59,940 --> 00:47:02,579
It was like she didn't want to mix
with people very much.

239
00:47:02,780 --> 00:47:05,692
She'd never come to company
parties or events.

240
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:09,734
I never knew she was looking
after her mother or anything.

241
00:47:09,940 --> 00:47:13,012
Her mother always made her a lunch,

242
00:47:13,220 --> 00:47:15,415
and she'd go out
on the roof and eat alone.

243
00:47:15,620 --> 00:47:18,453
I don't think she had, like,
a friend or anyone like that.

244
00:47:18,660 --> 00:47:24,417
A boyfriend?
I really doubt that.

245
00:47:24,620 --> 00:47:29,091
But suddenly she surprised everyone
by saying she was going to get

246
00:47:29,300 --> 00:47:33,816
her ears pierced. I remember
how happy she seemed then.

247
00:47:35,340 --> 00:47:37,296
After she separated
from her husband,

248
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:39,968
Sugiuchi Sachiko apparently
lived a pretty wild life.

249
00:47:41,220 --> 00:47:44,371
The mother seems
to have been an alcoholic.

250
00:47:44,580 --> 00:47:46,696
When she was drunk,
there was no stopping her,

251
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:51,018
and in the end
she had gone completely crazy.

252
00:47:51,220 --> 00:47:54,178
She abused her daughter
Yukiyo her whole life.

253
00:47:54,780 --> 00:47:58,250
Even made her eat dog food,
it would seem.

254
00:47:59,780 --> 00:48:01,498
That's horrible.

255
00:48:01,700 --> 00:48:06,490
Including the mother, Sugiuchi Sachiko,
six people have died in Unit 1303.

256
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:09,533
That's in only three years.

257
00:48:09,740 --> 00:48:13,699
It's too many people to clear
it all away under coincidence.

258
00:48:15,660 --> 00:48:17,173
Miss Midorigawa,

259
00:48:17,380 --> 00:48:22,249
do you think there's any chance your
younger sister committed suicide?

260
00:48:23,140 --> 00:48:25,415
No. Definitely not.
Of course not.

261
00:48:26,260 --> 00:48:30,856
Any way you look at it,
it's not natural that any of the women

262
00:48:31,060 --> 00:48:33,494
who died here
would have committed suicide.

263
00:48:34,580 --> 00:48:38,255
But that's what the police
have called it.

264
00:48:38,460 --> 00:48:42,692
There's absolutely no evidence
of a mishap or foul play.

265
00:48:44,020 --> 00:48:46,375
As far as the police are concerned,

266
00:48:46,580 --> 00:48:49,617
there's no other conclusion
to draw but suicide.

267
00:48:54,420 --> 00:48:59,335
I found this in my sister's apartment,
but I don't think it's hers.

268
00:48:59,540 --> 00:49:01,656
You can have it.

269
00:49:01,860 --> 00:49:03,816
Fine.

270
00:49:14,420 --> 00:49:18,777
MIDORIGAWA

271
00:49:34,020 --> 00:49:35,976
I'm back.

272
00:49:56,940 --> 00:49:58,896
Mother?

273
00:50:15,460 --> 00:50:17,849
Mother!
What are you doing?!

274
00:50:18,060 --> 00:50:22,178
Mariko, give Sayaka back.

275
00:50:23,380 --> 00:50:25,336
Mother!

276
00:50:25,540 --> 00:50:27,815
Stop it! Let go!

277
00:50:31,260 --> 00:50:38,940
She's all alone in that room, she says.
It hurts, she says.

278
00:50:39,660 --> 00:50:42,811
It's raining and she's cold, she says.

279
00:50:44,340 --> 00:50:46,615
I got some blankets ready.

280
00:50:46,820 --> 00:50:51,291
You've got to go out there.
You've got to go out there for her!

281
00:51:05,220 --> 00:51:08,337
Mother, please!
Stop this!

282
00:51:08,540 --> 00:51:12,533
Sayaka!
Sayaka!

283
00:51:13,100 --> 00:51:17,935
Mother, Sayaka's not here anymore.

284
00:51:18,140 --> 00:51:22,895
- She's dead.
- No! Give Sayaka back!

285
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:28,456
Mother...

286
00:51:34,620 --> 00:51:36,690
I'm still here.

287
00:51:40,700 --> 00:51:42,656
Why won't you see me?

288
00:51:43,940 --> 00:51:46,249
I'm just as hurt as you are.

289
00:51:50,700 --> 00:51:58,209
We can weep and wail all we want,
but it still won't bring Sayaka back.

290
00:51:59,940 --> 00:52:02,932
You've always been that way.

291
00:52:04,420 --> 00:52:06,376
What?

292
00:52:12,460 --> 00:52:15,532
Always blaming me, always critical...

293
00:52:17,460 --> 00:52:19,576
that's why I hate you.

294
00:52:25,660 --> 00:52:27,651
Why?

295
00:52:30,020 --> 00:52:32,136
Why would you say such a thing?

296
00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:41,696
That's awful!

297
00:52:48,060 --> 00:52:51,496
That's awful, Mother.

The Lamentation of Unit 1303:

The Love-Hate Hell of a Mother
Daughter alone by the Sea

300
00:53:55,620 --> 00:53:57,576
Half a year later she was dead.
With the corpse of her mother beside her,

301
00:53:57,780 --> 00:53:59,736
what was the daughter thinking?

302
00:53:59,940 --> 00:54:03,250
Now we know the hair-raising truth,
sought since the incident occurred.

Yukiyo, this is our new home.

308
00:55:29,100 --> 00:55:31,978
Happy birthday.
Now blow out the candles.

309
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:41,256
I'm back.

310
00:55:45,260 --> 00:55:47,216
Mother...

311
00:55:52,660 --> 00:55:55,174
Oh, you're back.

312
00:55:56,820 --> 00:56:00,096
Isn't that nice?
You were out having fun.

313
00:56:16,020 --> 00:56:19,490
What's all this about?

314
00:56:19,700 --> 00:56:23,329
My stomach was hurting a little.

315
00:56:25,140 --> 00:56:27,973
That's what you said last time.

316
00:56:30,580 --> 00:56:32,935
Don't you play stupid games with me!

317
00:56:33,380 --> 00:56:40,013
If you don't like
what your mother makes for you,

318
00:56:40,220 --> 00:56:43,929
then you can eat this!
There! Eat!

319
00:57:37,420 --> 00:57:40,093
I'm back.

320
00:58:32,660 --> 00:58:39,975
Die... die... die...

321
00:58:44,660 --> 00:58:47,220
What shall we play?

322
00:59:26,260 --> 00:59:28,820
What are those?

323
00:59:31,660 --> 00:59:39,578
How dare you defile the body
I gave you!

324
00:59:41,100 --> 00:59:43,694
What kind of a daughter
are you, anyway?!

325
00:59:43,900 --> 00:59:47,370
Ow! Stop it!

326
00:59:50,260 --> 00:59:52,216
Stop it, Mother!

327
01:00:02,580 --> 01:00:04,775
What are you doing?!
Yukiyo!

328
01:00:05,620 --> 01:00:07,975
What are you doing?!

329
01:00:19,420 --> 01:00:22,571
Murderer! Murderer!

330
01:00:31,420 --> 01:00:36,210
Mother... I'll always look after you.

331
01:00:38,340 --> 01:00:39,614
Please, Mother!

332
01:00:57,380 --> 01:01:00,133
Yukiyo...

333
01:01:23,460 --> 01:01:26,577
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. Mother.

334
01:01:34,820 --> 01:01:37,380
Miss Sugiuchi!

335
01:01:37,980 --> 01:01:40,972
I know you're in there!

336
01:01:41,860 --> 01:01:44,852
Miss Sugiuchi!

337
01:01:46,060 --> 01:01:48,858
I know you're in there.

338
01:01:56,540 --> 01:02:00,533
Miss Sugiuchi, you're six months
late on your rent.

339
01:02:00,740 --> 01:02:04,255
I'm afraid I have to ask you
and your mother to leave.

340
01:02:04,460 --> 01:02:08,453
See? This is an eviction notice
from the company.

341
01:02:09,260 --> 01:02:12,935
I'd like you out by the day
after tomorrow, if you don't mind.

342
01:02:13,140 --> 01:02:15,893
But where am I supposed to go?

343
01:02:16,100 --> 01:02:18,056
I don't have anywhere else to go.

344
01:02:19,100 --> 01:02:22,934
This is the only place
for my mother and me.

345
01:02:23,140 --> 01:02:28,339
If you want to live here,
you have to pay the rent.

346
01:02:28,540 --> 01:02:34,092
If you don't leave,
we'll use force and drive you out!

347
01:02:34,300 --> 01:02:37,133
That's what the company says.

348
01:02:44,100 --> 01:02:48,935
If you need to earn some money,
there's lots of different ways to do it.

349
01:02:54,580 --> 01:02:57,219
You know what you
have to do, don't you?

350
01:02:58,940 --> 01:03:00,896
Mother...

351
01:03:03,580 --> 01:03:09,018
Yukiyo, you really are
a useless little girl, you know.

352
01:03:09,900 --> 01:03:14,610
You can't survive if I'm not here.

353
01:03:15,740 --> 01:03:17,810
You're miserable.

354
01:03:20,540 --> 01:03:22,656
That's not true.

355
01:03:25,060 --> 01:03:29,975
I'm quite happy
living quietly here with you this way.

356
01:06:10,260 --> 01:06:12,979
UNKNOWN CALLER

357
01:06:16,500 --> 01:06:18,456
Hello?

358
01:06:26,380 --> 01:06:31,693
Sis? I'm scared.

359
01:06:32,860 --> 01:06:36,091
Sayaka?!
Is that you?!

360
01:07:16,700 --> 01:07:18,656
Mother?

361
01:07:24,100 --> 01:07:26,056
Mother!

362
01:07:35,620 --> 01:07:38,180
I'm going to where Sayaka is.
Mother.

363
01:07:39,140 --> 01:07:41,290
To where Sayaka is?

364
01:07:53,540 --> 01:07:55,496
Welcome!

365
01:07:55,700 --> 01:07:59,409
Cold beer! Cold beer!

366
01:08:03,540 --> 01:08:05,496
It's so hot!

367
01:08:05,700 --> 01:08:08,168
It's hard work dressing up
like a maid at the beach, isn't it?

368
01:08:08,380 --> 01:08:10,735
Yeah, but our shop's
number one in sales, you know.

369
01:08:10,940 --> 01:08:13,773
- Seriously?
- Seriously. The manager's ecstatic.

370
01:08:13,980 --> 01:08:15,413
Great!

371
01:08:15,620 --> 01:08:20,136
I thought the swimsuit place
would beat us out, though.

372
01:08:20,340 --> 01:08:22,296
Thanks.

373
01:08:22,500 --> 01:08:23,728
Hey, you're coming
to that party tonight, aren't you?

374
01:08:23,940 --> 01:08:25,612
Sure! 6:00, right?

375
01:08:25,820 --> 01:08:29,210
Where was it again?

376
01:08:29,420 --> 01:08:32,378
The Blue Palace Hiraoka, it says.

377
01:08:32,580 --> 01:08:34,536
What, it's not at a bar?

378
01:08:34,740 --> 01:08:37,493
In a condo?
Isn't that sort of suspicious?

379
01:08:40,220 --> 01:08:43,292
What?
There's someone in there already?!

380
01:08:44,660 --> 01:08:48,016
Yep. Just for the season, though.

381
01:08:48,220 --> 01:08:53,214
They said it was a group of students
working at the beach for the summer.

382
01:08:53,420 --> 01:08:54,933
I see...

383
01:08:55,140 --> 01:08:57,938
Well, I think it's a bit fast,

384
01:08:58,140 --> 01:08:59,858
but the company can't just
let it sit empty like that.

385
01:09:00,060 --> 01:09:02,016
Um...

386
01:09:04,300 --> 01:09:06,939
- Are they girls?
- I'm sorry?

387
01:09:07,140 --> 01:09:08,493
These students.

388
01:09:09,140 --> 01:09:12,450
Oh no.

389
01:09:14,540 --> 01:09:18,010
Boys. All of them.

390
01:09:20,180 --> 01:09:22,296
I see.

391
01:10:01,340 --> 01:10:04,252
Terribly sorry to keep you waiting.

392
01:10:11,860 --> 01:10:16,058
You've already got new people
in that apartment, don't you?

393
01:10:16,260 --> 01:10:18,615
Oh,

394
01:10:18,820 --> 01:10:22,176
that's a seasonal rental.

395
01:10:22,380 --> 01:10:23,938
They're only temporary.

396
01:10:25,420 --> 01:10:28,651
Several people have committed
suicide in the apartment, haven't they?

397
01:10:28,860 --> 01:10:31,328
Not just my sister.

398
01:10:33,380 --> 01:10:38,329
I haven't really
heard anything about that...

399
01:10:40,340 --> 01:10:44,253
You didn't tell my sister
about that, did you?

400
01:10:44,460 --> 01:10:46,416
Mr. Kawakami!

401
01:10:46,620 --> 01:10:50,613
Did you call Mr. Kobayashi on that
Blue Palace condo thing for me?

402
01:10:50,820 --> 01:10:53,095
Oh, yeah.
What was it about?

403
01:10:53,300 --> 01:10:55,052
The wallpaper color.

404
01:10:55,260 --> 01:10:58,969
Oh, right.
I'll get right on it.

405
01:11:01,580 --> 01:11:05,778
Anyway, I'm afraid I'm not the person
to talk to on that.

406
01:11:09,500 --> 01:11:12,173
You don't think there's anything
wrong with renting out an apartment

407
01:11:12,380 --> 01:11:15,452
where people have died and not
saying anything about it?!

408
01:11:59,180 --> 01:12:01,375
Ow!
What the hell?

409
01:13:28,540 --> 01:13:31,612
Chug! Chug! Chug!

410
01:13:35,340 --> 01:13:37,092
What's the matter?

411
01:13:37,300 --> 01:13:39,734
I just have the feeling
that there's someone watching me.

412
01:13:39,940 --> 01:13:41,737
Don't say things like that!

413
01:13:41,940 --> 01:13:43,658
Sorry, sorry.

414
01:13:47,660 --> 01:13:51,494
I read a book about Sugiuchi Yukiyo.

415
01:13:51,700 --> 01:13:54,658
Oh, you did?

416
01:13:55,380 --> 01:13:59,339
There were parts of it that
I felt were almost about me.

417
01:14:01,140 --> 01:14:03,779
My mother started suffering
from depression

418
01:14:03,980 --> 01:14:06,619
right after my father died.

419
01:14:06,820 --> 01:14:09,175
She did, did she?

420
01:14:10,660 --> 01:14:14,733
I always intended to do everything
I could to support her,

421
01:14:14,940 --> 01:14:17,659
but somewhere along the line
things just went bad between us.

422
01:14:17,860 --> 01:14:20,658
It was like my younger sister was
the only one she saw anymore.

423
01:14:20,860 --> 01:14:25,695
So once she was gone,
our house would have been...

424
01:14:34,420 --> 01:14:36,729
I'm so tired.

425
01:14:50,020 --> 01:14:56,368
I've spent far too long worrying
about my mother.

426
01:15:10,620 --> 01:15:13,180
I'm sorry.

427
01:15:13,380 --> 01:15:16,258
What am I saying?

428
01:15:16,460 --> 01:15:18,212
That's all right.

429
01:15:18,420 --> 01:15:21,173
A cop hears all sorts of things.

430
01:15:26,060 --> 01:15:28,255
By the way, about these...

431
01:15:28,460 --> 01:15:30,496
- These are...
- That's right.

432
01:15:30,700 --> 01:15:32,691
This is the one you picked up
in that apartment,

433
01:15:32,900 --> 01:15:36,449
and this one was found
with Sugiuchi Yukiyo's body.

434
01:15:36,660 --> 01:15:39,128
I knew it!
It was in the book.

435
01:15:39,340 --> 01:15:41,774
It said there was a wound
on her body,

436
01:15:41,980 --> 01:15:44,016
as if an earring had been
pulled out of her ear.

437
01:15:44,220 --> 01:15:46,859
And then did you know all those girls
who committed suicide

438
01:15:47,060 --> 01:15:48,379
had something in common?

439
01:15:48,580 --> 01:15:50,332
What is it?

440
01:15:50,540 --> 01:15:53,373
Since Sugiuchi Yukiyo,
all of the girls

441
01:15:53,580 --> 01:15:56,652
who've moved into Unit 1303
have just left home and begun to live

442
01:15:56,860 --> 01:16:00,694
alone for the first time.

443
01:16:00,900 --> 01:16:02,856
What difference does that make?

444
01:16:04,420 --> 01:16:07,696
Nothing, probably.

445
01:16:07,900 --> 01:16:12,610
It's just that you're still living
with your mother.

446
01:16:18,980 --> 01:16:22,768
Don't worry.
I won't be jumping.

447
01:16:22,980 --> 01:16:25,699
No, I don't think so.

448
01:16:34,860 --> 01:16:36,498
What is it?

449
01:16:48,180 --> 01:16:49,738
Miss Midorigawa?

450
01:17:01,260 --> 01:17:04,570
Could you let me
hold onto those earrings?

451
01:17:05,940 --> 01:17:08,215
Hold onto them?

452
01:17:08,420 --> 01:17:10,251
Yes.

453
01:17:16,100 --> 01:17:19,251
The gyu-tan game!
Yay!

454
01:17:19,460 --> 01:17:21,178
- Gyu!
- Gyu!

455
01:17:21,380 --> 01:17:22,699
Gyu!

456
01:17:22,900 --> 01:17:24,652
- Gyu!
- Guy!

457
01:17:24,860 --> 01:17:26,930
Gyu.

458
01:17:27,140 --> 01:17:29,051
- Gyu!
- Gyu!

459
01:17:29,260 --> 01:17:30,613
Gyu!

460
01:17:30,820 --> 01:17:33,573
- Gyu!
- Wrong!

461
01:17:33,780 --> 01:17:35,418
Okay, you lose.

462
01:17:35,620 --> 01:17:38,088
Chug! Chug! Chug!

463
01:17:39,460 --> 01:17:42,418
What happened?
Did the power go out?

464
01:17:42,620 --> 01:17:44,497
What?

465
01:17:44,700 --> 01:17:46,053
What's the matter?

466
01:17:46,260 --> 01:17:48,569
Breaker!
Go look at the fuse box.

467
01:17:48,780 --> 01:17:50,213
What's that smell?

468
01:17:50,420 --> 01:17:52,809
Something stinks!
What's that smell?

469
01:19:20,940 --> 01:19:22,771
What's the matter?

470
01:19:22,980 --> 01:19:24,572
Sorry?

471
01:19:24,780 --> 01:19:26,975
You look a little pale.

472
01:19:27,180 --> 01:19:30,172
Oh... no, I'm fine.

473
01:19:30,380 --> 01:19:32,371
Would you like to go back
to the condominium?

474
01:19:32,580 --> 01:19:35,219
No, thanks. I've already spoken
to the superintendent.

475
01:19:35,420 --> 01:19:39,777
And it looks like there's already
someone else in that apartment.

476
01:19:39,980 --> 01:19:43,973
She may already
be back home, anyway.

477
01:19:44,180 --> 01:19:46,614
We'll keep an eye out
for your mother here.

478
01:19:48,300 --> 01:19:51,372
It might be a good idea
if you checked back home.

479
01:19:51,580 --> 01:19:53,969
Yes, I'll do that.

480
01:19:56,460 --> 01:20:01,056
I'm sorry about all this, Mr. Sakurai.

481
01:20:02,500 --> 01:20:04,968
You've had a rough time,
too, haven't you?

482
01:20:29,420 --> 01:20:32,253
- Who? Who is it?
- I'm afraid I wouldn't know.

483
01:20:32,460 --> 01:20:35,099
What are you doing?!
Stop that!

484
01:20:37,700 --> 01:20:42,012
Yes, that's right.
It looks like three people have jumped

485
01:20:42,220 --> 01:20:44,256
from a balcony on the 13th floor.

486
01:21:39,780 --> 01:21:41,850
Mother!

487
01:21:53,820 --> 01:21:57,859
Mother, what are you doing here?

488
01:22:14,860 --> 01:22:18,819
Die!
Die! Die! Die! Die! Die!

489
01:22:33,500 --> 01:22:35,616
Mother!

490
01:22:59,860 --> 01:23:01,578
Mother!

491
01:23:56,860 --> 01:23:59,454
You're Yukiyo, aren't you?

492
01:24:15,860 --> 01:24:18,055
Why?!

493
01:24:20,580 --> 01:24:23,492
Why did you kill my sister?!

494
01:24:34,300 --> 01:24:36,814
My sister...

495
01:24:38,180 --> 01:24:40,614
all those other girls you killed
in this apartment...

496
01:24:40,820 --> 01:24:43,812
what did they ever do?!

497
01:25:20,860 --> 01:25:24,250
Hang on!
You can't fall!

498
01:25:27,260 --> 01:25:29,251
You mustn't fall!

499
01:25:30,300 --> 01:25:33,417
Please! Come up!
You can't fall!

500
01:25:44,260 --> 01:25:46,694
That's right!
You can do it!

501
01:27:44,260 --> 01:27:46,569
No!

502
01:28:32,300 --> 01:28:37,055
Why does everyone just come
walking into my home?

503
01:28:38,220 --> 01:28:39,778
What?

504
01:28:40,980 --> 01:28:44,939
Mother said I wasn't to let
anyone in here;

505
01:28:45,140 --> 01:28:49,418
that everybody else was evil.
Mother was right.

506
01:28:49,620 --> 01:28:53,613
But I let other people in here.
All those girls...

507
01:28:53,820 --> 01:28:55,492
Mother threw them out.

508
01:28:55,700 --> 01:29:00,216
They were evil, so she told me to kill
them... kill them all! Kill them!

509
01:29:04,860 --> 01:29:07,977
These are yours, aren't they?

510
01:29:14,500 --> 01:29:18,288
My earrings.

511
01:29:18,500 --> 01:29:21,572
Yukiyo, stop this!

512
01:29:21,780 --> 01:29:26,217
I'll look after you and your mother's
apartment for you.

513
01:29:26,420 --> 01:29:29,651
- You're lying!
- It's true! I'll live here.

514
01:29:29,860 --> 01:29:32,693
I'll live here together with my mother!

515
01:29:34,340 --> 01:29:37,491
Won't that be enough?

516
01:29:40,380 --> 01:29:43,178
Yukiyo...

517
01:29:44,300 --> 01:29:48,930
you'll be my younger sister.

518
01:30:30,780 --> 01:30:33,692
Miss Midorigawa!
Miss Midorigawa!

519
01:30:39,860 --> 01:30:41,930
Miss Midorigawa!

520
01:30:43,020 --> 01:30:45,011
Miss Midorigawa!

521
01:31:56,220 --> 01:31:59,815
Yukiyo! No!

522
01:32:01,100 --> 01:32:04,570
My mother only has
one girl... me!

523
01:32:39,260 --> 01:32:41,649
Sis...

524
01:32:41,860 --> 01:32:44,294
Sayaka.

525
01:32:45,980 --> 01:32:47,971
Miss Midorigawa!

526
01:33:22,340 --> 01:33:24,490
There goes another one.
