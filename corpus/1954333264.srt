357
00:14:06,212 --> 00:14:08,614
But I'll tell you
what my mother told me,

358
00:14:08,615 --> 00:14:10,549
and these are words to live by:

359
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:12,084
"Selfish people

360
00:14:12,085 --> 00:14:14,385
live longer."

361
00:14:14,453 --> 00:14:15,554
I'm just saying.

- Hi.
- Hey.

369
00:14:36,476 --> 00:14:38,677
I'm Kate. I met you on Friday.

370
00:14:38,678 --> 00:14:40,012
Yeah, I remember.

371
00:14:40,013 --> 00:14:42,279
Sorry about your urn.

372
00:14:42,414 --> 00:14:43,515
What are you doing here?

373
00:14:43,516 --> 00:14:47,286
Um, well, I found your number
in my husband's phone.

374
00:14:47,287 --> 00:14:48,053
Um...

375
00:14:48,054 --> 00:14:49,421
Well, actually, the phone bill.

'Cause I couldn't crack the code

obviously I don't know anything

that's going on in his life.

00:14:59,933 --> 00:15:02,501

you should ask him.

Oh, well, well, I would,

386
00:15:10,143 --> 00:15:12,111
but I'm pretty sure
he's lying to me

387
00:15:12,112 --> 00:15:15,579

at all.

and you would tell me
that I was crazy.

00:15:48,748 --> 00:15:49,615
I did not think

405
00:15:49,616 --> 00:15:51,450
- that I would be right...

Does this, um...

413
00:16:04,631 --> 00:16:05,764
Does this open?

414
00:16:05,765 --> 00:16:07,933
This window? Anywhere?

415
00:16:07,934 --> 00:16:09,802
This... There's got to be a...

416
00:16:09,803 --> 00:16:12,236
little latch or something.

417
00:16:12,237 --> 00:16:13,305

should go outside and get some fresh air.

lay down for a minute.

doesn't open?

No, and you're gonna be fine.

00:16:24,217 --> 00:16:25,217

425
00:16:25,218 --> 00:16:27,419
Just... just open it a little.

00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:29,588
Just crack it.

you want to know
if you just get up and leave.

Here, help me up.

(EXHALES)

437
00:16:55,047 --> 00:16:55,981
So, how long have you

438
00:16:55,982 --> 00:16:57,850
and my husband
been seeing each other?

439
00:16:57,851 --> 00:16:59,818
I don't know; a couple months.

440
00:16:59,819 --> 00:17:03,055
So when... Did you
just start sleeping together?

441
00:17:03,056 --> 00:17:05,591
Well, we were gonna try
to hold off for prom,

442
00:17:05,592 --> 00:17:07,926
but we kind of got carried away.

443
00:17:07,927 --> 00:17:09,495
We're adults. We had sex.

444
00:17:09,496 --> 00:17:11,330
- Okay.
- I really don't think that the details matter.

445
00:17:11,331 --> 00:17:14,466
The details do matter
because there's a difference

446
00:17:14,467 --> 00:17:16,368
between having sex one time

447
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:20,037
and having sex ten times.

448
00:17:20,038 --> 00:17:21,140
Oh, my God.

449
00:17:21,141 --> 00:17:23,041
Did you do it more than ten times?

450
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:26,076
I think specifics are a bad idea.

451
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,615
Okay, fine.

452
00:17:29,616 --> 00:17:32,184
Gun to my head,

453
00:17:32,185 --> 00:17:33,185
fifty.

00:17:33,186 --> 00:17:34,653

456
00:17:36,222 --> 00:17:38,190
- 50 times?!
- Just...

457
00:17:38,191 --> 00:17:40,626
You had sex with my husband
50 times?

458
00:17:40,627 --> 00:17:42,294
Don't you have a job?

459
00:17:42,295 --> 00:17:43,862
Or hobbies?

460
00:17:43,863 --> 00:17:46,264
What is wrong with you?

461
00:17:46,265 --> 00:17:50,402
Does this mean he's not training
for the marathon?

462
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:51,537
Yeah, no.

463
00:17:51,538 --> 00:17:52,738
This is not okay.

464
00:17:52,739 --> 00:17:54,139
I am part of Team King.

465
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:57,609
I quit my job so that
we could focus on his job.

466
00:17:57,610 --> 00:17:59,278
I put off having kids

467
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:01,213
because he wasn't ready.

468
00:18:01,214 --> 00:18:02,414
I went to China.

469
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:03,916
Do you have any idea

470
00:18:03,917 --> 00:18:05,350
how far away China is?

471
00:18:05,351 --> 00:18:07,419
- Yeah.
- And it's not all Hong Kong either.

472
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:08,687
Lots of pollution.

473
00:18:08,688 --> 00:18:09,721
So what do I do now?

474
00:18:09,722 --> 00:18:11,323
So I'm, now I'm Barb Melman?

475
00:18:11,324 --> 00:18:15,027
Barb Melman got divorced
and now she has cheek implants

476
00:18:15,028 --> 00:18:17,529
and lives in a condo in Norwalk

477
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:18,964
and has to go on dates.

478
00:18:18,965 --> 00:18:20,566
I am not equipped

479
00:18:20,567 --> 00:18:21,667
to go on dates.

480
00:18:21,668 --> 00:18:23,869
The last time I was single,
I was 24

481
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:26,271
and the dating pool was everyone.

482
00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:28,941
And now it's like a shallow puddle

483
00:18:28,942 --> 00:18:31,343
of age-appropriate men

484
00:18:31,344 --> 00:18:33,345
who are old and gross

485
00:18:33,346 --> 00:18:34,813
and I don't want to do that.

486
00:18:34,814 --> 00:18:37,683
I know that you think
that it's that bad,

487
00:18:37,684 --> 00:18:38,784
but honestly,

488
00:18:38,785 --> 00:18:40,385
it's a lot worse.

489
00:18:40,386 --> 00:18:41,186
You know why?

490
00:18:41,187 --> 00:18:42,754
Because even
if you meet a nice guy...

491
00:18:42,755 --> 00:18:43,755
and when I mean "nice,"

492
00:18:43,756 --> 00:18:46,525
I mean that he's, like,
not an obvious sociopath...

493
00:18:46,526 --> 00:18:49,094
you can't even actually
get excited about it.

494
00:18:49,095 --> 00:18:49,995
You know why?

495
00:18:49,996 --> 00:18:53,565
Because it's just a matter of time
before someone gets bored and unhappy

496
00:18:53,566 --> 00:18:56,401
and is saying that it's over,
and that's a happy ending.

497
00:18:56,402 --> 00:19:00,405
A shitty ending is that
there's lying and cheating

498
00:19:00,406 --> 00:19:01,807
and you ambush

499
00:19:01,808 --> 00:19:02,908
Prince Charming's wife.

500
00:19:02,909 --> 00:19:04,810
So you're saying
I should stay with him?

501
00:19:04,811 --> 00:19:07,546
I'm saying that
everything fails eventually,

502
00:19:07,547 --> 00:19:09,381
and monogamy is not natural.

503
00:19:09,382 --> 00:19:11,750
If you can live with that, like the
French, then go ahead and stay put,

504
00:19:11,751 --> 00:19:14,553
but if you can't, then I suggest
that you get a game plan

505
00:19:14,554 --> 00:19:15,854
- and you leave.
- But what about

506
00:19:15,855 --> 00:19:17,756
the people who try to work it out?

507
00:19:17,757 --> 00:19:20,626
Maybe that would be an option.

508
00:19:20,627 --> 00:19:22,594
Cheaters don't change.

509
00:19:22,595 --> 00:19:23,996
And if you work it out,

510
00:19:23,997 --> 00:19:25,297
he's just gonna do it again,

511
00:19:25,298 --> 00:19:27,299
and you're gonna end up
right back where you started,

512
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:30,369
wishing that you had left
the first time around.

513
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:31,570
But that's just me.

514
00:19:31,571 --> 00:19:32,504
He's your husband.

515
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:35,007
What does your gut tell you?

517
00:19:36,376 --> 00:19:38,709
That was just a burp.

Can-can I get some napkins?

521
00:19:44,784 --> 00:19:46,617
That was throw-up.

that's why he's still calling.

but it turns out
they're still seeing each other.

1175

- So I heard him

on the phone with her,

1177
00:44:05,276 --> 00:44:07,344

and he's like,

- Car...

- Carly. Carmela.
- Carmela.

1187
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:22,526
- You're talking about Carmela.
- Right.

1188
00:44:22,527 --> 00:44:26,130
And then she doesn't even know that
I know that they're still together,

1189
00:44:26,131 --> 00:44:27,831
and so she's pretending
to be friends with me,

1190
00:44:27,832 --> 00:44:30,134
but she's spying on me
like a double agent.

1191
00:44:30,135 --> 00:44:31,468
And you're letting her
pretend because...

1192
00:44:31,469 --> 00:44:33,070
Because that's how you run
a double agent.

1193

- I don't even know

call her out on it.

an apology for the other night.

1210

- Do you? Hmm.
- Yeah.

1211
00:45:04,435 --> 00:45:08,071
I know sometimes I can be
more tough than love, and...

1212

Can you?

1213
00:45:08,973 --> 00:45:12,342
Yeah, and I just wanted
to clear the air

1214

and-and say
that whatever happens

1215
00:45:15,213 --> 00:45:17,447

is your business.

1217
00:45:19,851 --> 00:45:21,518
Yeah. Are you okay?

1218

Are you still sleeping
with my husband?

- You heard me.

1220
00:45:26,791 --> 00:45:27,457
This is unbelievable.

1221
00:45:27,458 --> 00:45:29,293
- No, no, no, no, no...
- I must be crazy to think

1222
00:45:29,294 --> 00:45:31,295
I could be best friend
with my ex-boyfriend's w...

1223
00:45:31,296 --> 00:45:32,496
You don't get to ice me out.

1225

You can't... you can't ice me out.

1226

- I am gonna ice you out.

gonna pull out my weave?

Why don't you start
telling me the truth!

1231
00:45:43,408 --> 00:45:45,275
What, you want to know the truth?

1232
00:45:45,276 --> 00:45:46,977
Your husband sucks!

1233
00:45:46,978 --> 00:45:48,045
I am not sleeping with him.

1234
00:45:48,046 --> 00:45:52,616
And the fact that you think

1406
00:53:49,493 --> 00:53:52,562
When you have a body like that,
everything fits you perfectly.

1407
00:53:59,369 --> 00:54:00,770
Do you know what this is?
This is just

1408
00:54:00,771 --> 00:54:03,773
- so unoriginal, Mark.
- She has a good stride. Wow.

1409
00:54:03,774 --> 00:54:05,141
So cliche.

1410
00:54:10,013 --> 00:54:12,382
- I mean, she's, like, a perfect ten.
- She's pretty good.

1411
00:54:12,383 --> 00:54:14,284
- Lemon tart, double-D...
- Maybe, like, an 11.

1412
00:54:14,285 --> 00:54:15,852
- ...obviously natural double-D.
- That's a triple-D.

1413
00:54:15,853 --> 00:54:17,654
CARLY: It's, like,
a midlife crises mistress.

1414
00:54:17,655 --> 00:54:21,391
She's like a cliche version of
every wife's waking nightmare.

1415
00:54:21,392 --> 00:54:23,560
KATE: You have to admit
that's pretty good, though.

1416
00:54:23,561 --> 00:54:25,562
- Seriously.
- It's a... Okay, great, it's fine.

1417
00:54:25,563 --> 00:54:26,396
She's beautiful.
But you know what?

1418
00:54:26,397 --> 00:54:27,831
Okay, at some point, you say,
"I play tennis," right?

1419
00:54:27,832 --> 00:54:29,599
You know what? How are you
not freaking about this?

1420
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:31,935
But if I play against
John McEnroe,

1421
00:54:31,936 --> 00:54:33,536
then I expect to lose.

1422
00:54:33,537 --> 00:54:35,105
- You know what?
- Right?

1423
00:54:35,106 --> 00:54:36,673
I am McEnroe!

1424
00:54:36,674 --> 00:54:39,042
What are you doing!

1425
00:54:39,043 --> 00:54:42,579
Where are you going?
Wait!

1426
00:54:42,580 --> 00:54:44,814
KATE:
No!

1427
00:54:44,815 --> 00:54:47,917
Don't...!

1428
00:54:50,388 --> 00:54:54,322
KATE:
What happened to being calm!

1429
00:55:03,433 --> 00:55:06,569
Carly! Carly!

1430
00:55:06,570 --> 00:55:09,938
Stop...!

1431
00:55:20,784 --> 00:55:23,420
CARLY: I can't believe
he's been cheating on me!

1432
00:55:23,421 --> 00:55:25,755
KATE: Oh, boo-hoo!
He cheated on me, too!

1433
00:55:25,756 --> 00:55:28,124
CARLY: You're the wife!
He's supposed to cheat on you!

1434
00:55:28,125 --> 00:55:29,092
Ow!

1435
00:55:29,093 --> 00:55:30,059
Oh, my God!

1436
00:55:30,060 --> 00:55:32,629
(INDISTINCT SHOUTING)
Ow!

1437
00:55:32,630 --> 00:55:33,630
Stop the grappling!

1438
00:55:33,631 --> 00:55:36,800
I'm strong when I'm mad...!

1439
00:55:36,801 --> 00:55:39,501
(BOTH YELLING)

1440
00:55:39,769 --> 00:55:41,938
(YELLING CONTINUES)

1441
00:55:41,939 --> 00:55:44,739
WOMAN:
What's going on?

1442
00:55:50,713 --> 00:55:54,049
- Hi.
- Hi.

1443
00:55:54,584 --> 00:55:55,785
I just can't believe

1444
00:55:55,786 --> 00:55:56,619
he'd lie to me.

1445
00:55:56,620 --> 00:55:59,122
I really thought
we were soul mates.

1446
00:55:59,123 --> 00:56:00,990
Oh, my God, I am so sorry.

1447
00:56:00,991 --> 00:56:02,692
I can't believe I just said that.

1448
00:56:02,693 --> 00:56:04,394
You're his soul mate;
I'm a whore.

1449
00:56:04,395 --> 00:56:06,963
- No.
- You must hate me so much right now.

1450
00:56:06,964 --> 00:56:09,632
But if it's any consolation,
right now, I hate me more.

1451
00:56:09,633 --> 00:56:12,035
I don't hate you.
I don't hate you at all.

1452
00:56:12,036 --> 00:56:14,003
I got all of that out of my system

1453
00:56:14,004 --> 00:56:15,138
with that one.
How can you be

1454
00:56:15,139 --> 00:56:18,541
so amazing you could be friends
with your husband's mistress?

1455
00:56:18,542 --> 00:56:19,843
Yeah, it's like a dream come true.

1456
00:56:19,844 --> 00:56:21,578
- Seriously?
- You know what, ignore her.

1457
00:56:21,579 --> 00:56:25,148
She's just working through
some stuff right now. She's...

1458
00:56:25,149 --> 00:56:26,483
she's kind of troubled.

1459
00:56:26,484 --> 00:56:29,619
But you smell amazing.
What is that?

1460
00:56:29,620 --> 00:56:32,055
I think it's just sweat.

1461
00:56:32,056 --> 00:56:33,423
You know what the worst part

1462
00:56:33,424 --> 00:56:34,524
about this is?
You seem so nice,

1463
00:56:34,525 --> 00:56:36,593
and this whole time
he had me believing

1464
00:56:36,594 --> 00:56:37,427
you were the devil.

1465
00:56:37,428 --> 00:56:38,528
- Wait, what?
- He said that

1466
00:56:38,529 --> 00:56:41,631
you cheated on him
and then asked for a divorce.

1467
00:56:41,632 --> 00:56:43,066
He said that I...
(STAMMERING)

1468
00:56:43,067 --> 00:56:45,935
I was the cheater?
That's what he said?

1469
00:56:45,936 --> 00:56:46,402
Yeah.

1470
00:56:46,403 --> 00:56:48,538
Th-That I cheated?
I'm so sorry.

1471
00:56:48,539 --> 00:56:51,140
That is so...
Okay, well, that's...

1472
00:56:51,141 --> 00:56:52,208
What an asshole!

1473
00:56:52,209 --> 00:56:54,077
He's a liar, Kate.
Who cares what he says?

1474
00:56:54,078 --> 00:56:56,145
Because it's not fair.
And he made me

1475
00:56:56,146 --> 00:56:58,581
the bad guy.
And he's divorcing me?

1476
00:56:58,582 --> 00:57:00,583
You know it's not actually
happening, right?

1477
00:57:00,584 --> 00:57:02,218
Okay, but he could have
picked any scenario,

1478
00:57:02,219 --> 00:57:03,553
and he picks that one?

1479
00:57:03,554 --> 00:57:04,721
And he makes me the villain?

1480
00:57:04,722 --> 00:57:07,290
And then divorces me
for fake cheating?

1481
00:57:07,291 --> 00:57:09,325
I shouldn't have told you.
I'm so sorry.

1482
00:57:09,326 --> 00:57:12,729
Honey, it's not your fault
that I married a monster.

1483
00:57:12,730 --> 00:57:15,532
You are innocent in all of this.

1484
00:57:15,533 --> 00:57:17,767
Let's go back to Phil's.
Okay, let's go.

1485
00:57:17,768 --> 00:57:19,035
Wait... what am I
supposed to do?

1486
00:57:19,036 --> 00:57:20,003
You guys can't just leave me.

1487
00:57:20,004 --> 00:57:21,237
Mark's gonna be back from the gym

1488
00:57:21,238 --> 00:57:22,205
- any minute.
- We'll get your number.

1489
00:57:22,206 --> 00:57:23,573
- We'll get your num...
- Can we keep her?

1490
00:57:23,574 --> 00:57:26,743
- No, we can't keep her!
- We already have a dog at home!

1491
00:57:26,744 --> 00:57:28,912
You pulled my hair,
which is totally out of...

1492
00:57:28,913 --> 00:57:30,146
PHIL:
Hey, hey, hey! Hey!

1493
00:57:30,147 --> 00:57:31,281
you cannot just make some...

1494
00:57:31,282 --> 00:57:33,516
Check this out.
Watch what I taught Thunder.

1495
00:57:33,517 --> 00:57:35,184
Thunder, get me a beer.

1496
00:57:35,185 --> 00:57:36,819
(GRUNTS)

1497
00:57:36,820 --> 00:57:38,054
KATE: Unbelievable.
CARLY: Wow!

1498
00:57:38,055 --> 00:57:39,923
- That's crazy. It's crazy.
- It's a miracle.

1499
00:57:39,924 --> 00:57:43,159
That dog is trying to break me.
He really is.

1500
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:45,094
PHIL: Good boy. Good boy.
- Thunder. Thunder.

1501
00:57:45,095 --> 00:57:47,196
- So, how was the stalking?
- Thank you, thank you...

1502
00:57:47,197 --> 00:57:49,198
- Thunder. Traitor.
- ...thank you, thank you.

1503
00:57:49,199 --> 00:57:51,399
How did it go, weirdo?

1504
00:57:51,634 --> 00:57:52,101
Oh, it was good.

1505
00:57:52,102 --> 00:57:55,171
We took a run on the beach,
we met Mark's new mistress...

1506
00:57:55,172 --> 00:57:56,873
CARLY: Amber.
It was good.

1507
00:57:56,874 --> 00:57:57,674
22, super-hot.

1508
00:57:57,675 --> 00:57:58,908
- Are you jealous?
- No, I'm not jealous.

1509
00:57:58,909 --> 00:58:00,276
- You are.
- I just don't have, like,

1510
00:58:00,277 --> 00:58:01,344
an insane girl crush.

1511
00:58:01,345 --> 00:58:03,112
I think it's good
that she's super-hot.

1512
00:58:03,113 --> 00:58:05,815
I feel like it brings up
our group average.

1513
00:58:05,816 --> 00:58:07,584
This is not frickin'
<i>Sister Wives,</i> honey.

1514
00:58:07,585 --> 00:58:08,651
Are you sure that
you're not angry?

1515
00:58:08,652 --> 00:58:10,019
Because letting it out
is a whole lot better

1516
00:58:10,020 --> 00:58:11,654
than having to tell
the cops you didn't mean

1517
00:58:11,655 --> 00:58:14,290
- to hug her to death.
- Ha, ha! You're so funny!

1518
00:58:14,291 --> 00:58:15,024
Oh, my God!

1519
00:58:15,025 --> 00:58:16,626
You'll see when you meet her.

1520
00:58:16,627 --> 00:58:19,629

00:58:31,241 --> 00:58:33,175

1528
00:58:33,176 --> 00:58:34,944
That's the best part of the house.

- He is.

Right?

00:58:45,923 --> 00:58:49,157

00:58:50,293 --> 00:58:52,227
Wow.

1537
00:59:01,938 --> 00:59:05,308
I know exactly what
I would do with it.

1538
00:59:05,309 --> 00:59:06,009
What?

1539
00:59:06,010 --> 00:59:09,545
I would put
a coffee table right here,

1540
00:59:09,546 --> 00:59:13,149
so that I could have
my morning coffee.

1541
00:59:13,150 --> 00:59:14,651
Not there. You can't.
It doesn't work.

1542
00:59:14,652 --> 00:59:16,719
There's too much morning sun.
It would blast you.

1543
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:21,324
No, this is where I would
want to exist... right here.

1544
00:59:21,325 --> 00:59:23,660
Looking at that.

00:59:23,661 --> 00:59:25,560

01:20:31,260 --> 01:20:32,360
AMBER:
He can't even have any sex

2088
01:20:32,361 --> 01:20:33,495
till he finishes his Z-Pak.

2089
01:20:33,496 --> 01:20:34,863
(LAUGHS) Yay.
CARLY: Mark's not just

2090
01:20:34,864 --> 01:20:37,198
a cheating scumbag,
he's also a thief.

2091
01:20:37,199 --> 01:20:37,933
Look what I found.

2092
01:20:37,934 --> 01:20:40,702
This is a list of all
of the start-up companies

2093
01:20:40,703 --> 01:20:41,670
that Mark has invested in.

2094
01:20:41,671 --> 01:20:44,639
Three are offshore, but only
one was a blind filing.

2095
01:20:44,640 --> 01:20:46,174
No board of directors.

2096
01:20:46,175 --> 01:20:48,176
It has a P.O. box
for an address,

2097
01:20:48,177 --> 01:20:50,612
and it's been operating at
a total loss in the Bahamas.

2098
01:20:50,613 --> 01:20:51,579
ServiceCircuit.

2099
01:20:51,580 --> 01:20:53,548
This is it, Kate.
No, that can't be right.

2100
01:20:53,549 --> 01:20:56,084
Mark was talking about
ServiceCircuit last night.

2101
01:20:56,085 --> 01:20:57,152
They're putting more money

2102
01:20:57,153 --> 01:20:58,520
into it.
That's part of the con.

2103
01:20:58,521 --> 01:21:00,822
All we have to do is find out
the bank he's using.

2104
01:21:00,823 --> 01:21:02,457
No, I was with the
board last night,

2105
01:21:02,458 --> 01:21:03,692
and they seem really happy.

2106
01:21:03,693 --> 01:21:05,260
Mark is making them rich.

2107
01:21:05,261 --> 01:21:07,128
He's stealing, Kate,
and making money for them

2108
01:21:07,129 --> 01:21:09,297
is just one of the ways
that he does it.

2109
01:21:09,298 --> 01:21:11,333
Okay, wait, Kate, what's going on?

2110
01:21:11,334 --> 01:21:12,734
Nothing, I just think

2111
01:21:12,735 --> 01:21:14,536
that it's more complicated

2112
01:21:14,537 --> 01:21:16,438
than we thought.

2113
01:21:16,439 --> 01:21:19,174
You slept with him, didn't you?

2114
01:21:19,175 --> 01:21:19,774
One night?

2115
01:21:19,775 --> 01:21:21,276
You go right back
to being a Stepford?

2116
01:21:21,277 --> 01:21:23,044
What am I supposed to do?
That's great.

2117
01:21:23,045 --> 01:21:25,480
He must have literally
screwed your brains out.

2118
01:21:25,481 --> 01:21:28,683
So what? Maybe you just have
to forgive people

2119
01:21:28,684 --> 01:21:29,417
in order to move forward.

2120
01:21:29,418 --> 01:21:31,353
But he didn't ask you for
forgiveness, now, did he?

2121
01:21:31,354 --> 01:21:32,320
Maybe if you
had something to lose,

2122
01:21:32,321 --> 01:21:35,256
- you would understand how hard this is for me?
- CARLY: Like what?

2123
01:21:35,257 --> 01:21:36,424
Like a cheating husband of my own?

2124
01:21:36,425 --> 01:21:37,559
Both of you, stop.
You know what,

2125
01:21:37,560 --> 01:21:39,227
things shifted this weekend.

2126
01:21:39,228 --> 01:21:40,161
It was different.

2127
01:21:40,162 --> 01:21:43,630
So you don't know.
Really?

2128
01:21:45,300 --> 01:21:46,501
What are you doing?

2129
01:21:46,502 --> 01:21:48,703
I'm gonna see
if Mark wants to hang out.

2130
01:21:48,704 --> 01:21:50,271
What's wrong with you?

2131
01:21:50,272 --> 01:21:51,239
KATE:
Everything.

2132
01:21:51,240 --> 01:21:52,273
Everything is wrong with you,

2133
01:21:52,274 --> 01:21:54,943
and you know what,
I feel like an idiot right now

2134
01:21:54,944 --> 01:21:56,845
for trusting you over him.

2135
01:21:56,846 --> 01:21:59,613
I am done.

2136
01:22:02,617 --> 01:22:04,853
Kate, wait.

But nothing from Amber either?

2140
01:22:47,797 --> 01:22:50,365
No, and I feel like
if Amber won't talk to me,

2141
01:22:50,366 --> 01:22:53,835
then... I obviously
I did something wrong.

2142
01:22:53,836 --> 01:22:57,005
I think you're being hard
on yourself.

2143
01:22:57,006 --> 01:22:58,773
I don't know, I can't tell.

and-and then it just comes out
so harsh.

2147
01:23:04,480 --> 01:23:07,115
Well, you know,
what the hell do you know?

2148
01:23:07,116 --> 01:23:09,449
You get it wrong all the time.

2149
01:23:11,853 --> 01:23:13,054
Sorry.

2150
01:23:13,055 --> 01:23:15,490
I'm usually a fun date.
I am.

2151
01:23:15,491 --> 01:23:16,858
I'm having fun.
Yeah?

2152
01:23:16,859 --> 01:23:20,827
Not a lot of it, but some.

2153
01:23:20,995 --> 01:23:23,498
You should think
about being nicer to me.

2154
01:23:23,499 --> 01:23:26,901
'Cause I'm not certain
I really like you yet.

2155
01:23:26,902 --> 01:23:28,803
I think you like me.

2156
01:23:28,804 --> 01:23:30,738
Do I?

No, don't get too close to me.

What's wrong?

2166
01:23:49,959 --> 01:23:51,693
I went to the doctor.

2167
01:23:51,694 --> 01:23:52,727
He gave me a Z-Pak.

2168
01:23:52,728 --> 01:23:54,996
He said there's something
nasty going around,

2169
01:23:54,997 --> 01:23:57,499
and that you should take one, too.

2170
01:23:57,500 --> 01:23:58,533
That's for you.

2171
01:23:58,534 --> 01:24:00,135
A Z-Pak? I'm not sick, though.

2172
01:24:00,136 --> 01:24:02,036
Well, that's why you
take it beforehand,

2173
01:24:02,037 --> 01:24:03,538
so you don't get sick.

2174
01:24:03,539 --> 01:24:05,772
It's prophylactic.

01:24:13,314 --> 01:24:13,915

01:24:13,916 --> 01:24:16,484
I need you to sign
some papers for me.

it today, that'd be great.

it's just the usual stuff.

Well, no, no.

2188
01:24:57,092 --> 01:24:58,660
You were right about everything,

2189
01:24:58,661 --> 01:24:59,928
and he's still lying to me,

2190
01:24:59,929 --> 01:25:02,897
and he's still treating me
like I'm blind, and I'm not.

You're not.
You're not.

2192
01:25:06,134 --> 01:25:08,469

01:25:08,470 --> 01:25:10,138
They're wire transfer instructions

2194
01:25:10,139 --> 01:25:11,973
for a company in the Bahamas.

2195
01:25:11,974 --> 01:25:13,775
Mark is flying down this week.

2196
01:25:13,776 --> 01:25:14,976
You said that all we had to do

2197
01:25:14,977 --> 01:25:16,644
was find out where he banks, right?

2198
01:25:16,645 --> 01:25:18,613
So let's go to the Bahamas

2199
01:25:18,614 --> 01:25:20,215
and let's get him.

2200
01:25:20,216 --> 01:25:23,451

2201
01:25:23,452 --> 01:25:24,419
I can't.

2202
01:25:24,420 --> 01:25:27,121
I can't stay in this
Mark moment forever.

2203
01:25:27,122 --> 01:25:30,024
I can't,
and if I'm investigating him

2204
01:25:30,025 --> 01:25:31,859
or if go to the Bahamas,

2205
01:25:31,860 --> 01:25:34,896
then I'm still involved, and...

2206
01:25:34,897 --> 01:25:38,431
I just can't do that anymore.

2207
01:25:38,866 --> 01:25:40,201
I'm sorry.

2208
01:25:40,202 --> 01:25:43,004
No, okay, I get it.

2209
01:25:43,005 --> 01:25:45,538
No, okay.

2210
01:25:45,807 --> 01:25:48,576
