We're all on the same side here.

00:26:59,813 --> 00:27:01,169
What side's that?

371
00:27:01,203 --> 00:27:03,359
The outside.

372
00:27:03,393 --> 00:27:05,930
Grayden, that's the Reaper,
man.

373
00:27:05,966 --> 00:27:07,251
What's the Reaper?

374
00:27:07,286 --> 00:27:10,587
He used to be bad news.

375
00:27:10,623 --> 00:27:12,152
You know a biker named Catfish?

376
00:27:12,187 --> 00:27:14,550
He's somewhere between here and
Hopi Land.

377
00:27:14,584 --> 00:27:16,219
We all know Catfish, man.

378
00:27:16,253 --> 00:27:18,547
He was through here about a week
ago.

379
00:27:18,582 --> 00:27:22,336
I told you, I do the talking
here!

380
00:27:22,371 --> 00:27:23,586
This mean anything to you?

381
00:27:23,622 --> 00:27:24,560
Nothing.

382
00:27:24,594 --> 00:27:27,307
What do you want from us?

383
00:27:27,341 --> 00:27:31,964
I'm looking for a fortune, and
Catfish can help me find it.

384
00:27:31,998 --> 00:27:34,605
Anyone want a cut?

385
00:27:34,639 --> 00:27:36,690
We got everything we need here.

We don't need you or your money.

387
00:27:40,896 --> 00:27:44,893
Well, you've got high ideals
and a lot of balls.

388
00:27:44,928 --> 00:27:46,422
Might makes right.

389
00:27:46,458 --> 00:27:49,932
Why don't you just ride the fuck
out of here, Reaper.

390
00:27:49,968 --> 00:27:50,906

00:28:06,964 --> 00:28:08,355
So much for having balls.

We can all die here right now,
or you can ride with me

394

and get rich.

395
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,843
The man who finds Catfish first
will be

396
00:28:17,877 --> 00:28:19,338
able to finance his own army.

397
00:28:34,422 --> 00:28:37,793
I thought you'd see it my way.

398
00:28:37,828 --> 00:28:38,801
Let's ride!

399
00:29:03,896 --> 00:29:05,772
You like that, huh?

400
00:29:05,807 --> 00:29:07,093
How about another one?

401
00:29:07,128 --> 00:29:08,380
I'm getting tired of these
beans.

00:29:19,571 --> 00:29:22,560
I can't believe it, boss, a
rainstorm out

404
00:29:22,595 --> 00:29:23,567
in the middle of the desert.

405
00:30:11,046 --> 00:30:13,583
Here, boy.

406
00:30:13,618 --> 00:30:15,009

So how'd you find me?

Your energy's strong, easy to
track.

410
00:30:51,573 --> 00:30:53,277
You see a dog around here?

411
00:30:53,311 --> 00:30:55,604
Yeah, he ran off as I rode up.

412
00:30:55,638 --> 00:30:59,011
He had business somewhere else.

413
00:30:59,045 --> 00:31:00,332
What brings you out here?

414
00:31:00,366 --> 00:31:02,139
RAINMAKER: I'm looking for work.

00:31:02,173 --> 00:31:05,059
My reputation isn't what it used
to be.

416
00:31:05,093 --> 00:31:06,032
What's the matter?

417
00:31:06,066 --> 00:31:07,630

418
00:31:07,665 --> 00:31:10,793
The sky is different now.

419
00:31:10,828 --> 00:31:15,555

427
00:31:38,877 --> 00:31:42,110
When I first met you two years
ago, you were pissed off.

00:31:42,144 --> 00:31:44,300
But your soul was clear.

they took it to a Hopi

Leonard Bowen, professor at
U&M.

918
01:05:11,376 --> 01:05:12,384
Professor of what?

919
01:05:12,418 --> 01:05:13,357
History.

920
01:05:13,392 --> 01:05:15,512
What are you doing out here?

921
01:05:15,547 --> 01:05:16,763
It's a field trip.

922
01:05:16,798 --> 01:05:17,701
Navajo Nation--

923
01:05:17,735 --> 01:05:19,370
Have you found a cave?

924
01:05:19,405 --> 01:05:20,795
A cave?

925
01:05:20,829 --> 01:05:22,255
A cave!

926
01:05:22,289 --> 01:05:23,992
Look at this.

927
01:05:24,027 --> 01:05:25,904
Have you seen this cave?

928
01:05:25,939 --> 01:05:27,051
No.

929
01:05:27,086 --> 01:05:28,441
There's no caves up here!

930
01:05:33,898 --> 01:05:36,296

bitches, man.

When we're finished.

932
01:05:37,548 --> 01:05:38,938
Come on, that's bullshit.

933
01:05:38,972 --> 01:05:39,946
There's no cave.

934
01:05:39,981 --> 01:05:42,275
We followed you halfway across
the desert.

935
01:05:42,310 --> 01:05:43,734
There's no cave.

936
01:05:43,769 --> 01:05:45,194
There's no gold.

Ugh!

940
01:05:53,466 --> 01:05:55,100
I said, when we're finished.

941
01:06:01,739 --> 01:06:03,893
Where the hell is it?

942
01:06:03,928 --> 01:06:07,717
If my guess is right, this is
it.

943
01:06:07,751 --> 01:06:10,185
What do you mean?

944
01:06:10,219 --> 01:06:11,366
Give me-- give me your map.

945
01:06:19,152 --> 01:06:20,786
I don't think it's a cave.

946
01:06:20,820 --> 01:06:21,793
I think it's a marker.

947
01:06:21,828 --> 01:06:23,254
REAPER: Meaning what?

948
01:06:23,288 --> 01:06:25,304
Meaning, your map leads you
here

949
01:06:25,339 --> 01:06:27,632
to match those black shapes.

950
01:06:27,667 --> 01:06:30,587
From here, you have to read both
maps together.

951
01:06:30,621 --> 01:06:31,873
Yeah, yeah, so go ahead.

952
01:06:31,908 --> 01:06:35,175
Well, there's a lightning bolt
on both maps in the corners,

953
01:06:35,210 --> 01:06:37,434
unrelated to anything else.

954
01:06:37,470 --> 01:06:40,424
Your map has 15 marks.

955
01:06:40,458 --> 01:06:42,335
Just marks, nothing else.

956
01:06:42,369 --> 01:06:44,907
I thought the gold would be
buried 15 feet deep.

957
01:06:44,941 --> 01:06:46,332
The gold?

958
01:06:46,366 --> 01:06:47,618
My God.

959
01:06:47,652 --> 01:06:50,399
You don't think Quantrill's
Raiders brought the gold here?

960
01:06:50,433 --> 01:06:52,414
I don't care who the fuck
brought it here.

961
01:06:52,450 --> 01:06:53,630
I'm the one that's taking it
away.

962
01:07:02,425 --> 01:07:04,580
Maybe the marks on your map
means miles

963
01:07:04,614 --> 01:07:08,194
and the squiggly line on the
wall indicates a river.

964
01:07:08,229 --> 01:07:10,730
The tepees are 15 miles
downriver.

965
01:07:10,766 --> 01:07:12,330
An Indian camp or something.

966
01:07:12,365 --> 01:07:14,451
And what's the lightning?

967
01:07:14,485 --> 01:07:15,736
We'll find out when we get
there.

968
01:07:15,771 --> 01:07:16,778
Get where?

969
01:07:16,814 --> 01:07:19,838
There isn't a river within 100
miles of here.

970
01:07:19,872 --> 01:07:21,332
Not anymore.

971
01:07:30,578 --> 01:07:31,759
So what are we gonna do?

972
01:07:31,794 --> 01:07:33,358
Keep the girls here a couple
hours,

973
01:07:33,394 --> 01:07:35,861
in case this doesn't work out.

974
01:07:35,895 --> 01:07:37,702
I don't want you touching 'em.

975
01:07:37,737 --> 01:07:38,641
Then what?

976
01:07:38,675 --> 01:07:41,039
Catch up to us.

977
01:07:41,074 --> 01:07:43,785

978
01:07:43,820 --> 01:07:44,863
Whatever you want.

979
01:07:44,897 --> 01:07:45,836
Move out!

980
01:07:54,560 --> 01:07:55,603
What's gonna happen to us?

981
01:07:55,637 --> 01:07:56,542
You heard them.

982
01:07:56,576 --> 01:07:58,349
You saw them.

983
01:07:58,383 --> 01:07:59,669
We're all gonna get killed.

984
01:07:59,703 --> 01:08:02,971
Look, the Professor has a
pistol in the rover.

985
01:08:03,006 --> 01:08:04,847
We just have to get to it.

986
01:08:04,883 --> 01:08:05,821
Are you crazy?

987
01:08:05,856 --> 01:08:08,185
Look, he just killed one of his
own guys.

right.

We'll be all over the news when
they find our bodies.

Oh, bullshit!

993
01:08:17,464 --> 01:08:18,473
Both of you, shut up.

What about Reaper?

1004
01:08:43,775 --> 01:08:47,565
He said to leave the girls alone
for a couple of hours.

1005
01:08:47,599 --> 01:08:50,726
All i heard Reaper say was,
don't touch 'em.
