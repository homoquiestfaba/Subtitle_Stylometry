of shark stem cells
in your research.

1054
00:52:58,087 --> 00:53:00,351
- The teeth re-grow in sharks,

1055
00:53:00,394 --> 00:53:03,441
and once a tooth falls out,
another one grows back.

1056
00:53:03,484 --> 00:53:05,269
So if we can harness the ability

1057
00:53:05,312 --> 00:53:08,054
that sharks have
to re-grow their own teeth,

1058

in humans.

coming up with outrageous,
outlandish, hilarious ideas.

1389
01:10:45,545 --> 01:10:46,590
I know he won't.

1390
01:10:46,633 --> 01:10:49,201
It's just his nature.

1391
01:10:49,245 --> 01:10:50,942
It's what he'll do.

1392
01:10:50,985 --> 01:10:53,684
- You never know what he's
gonna come up with next.

1393
01:10:53,727 --> 01:10:55,903
You never know
where he's going,

1394
01:10:55,947 --> 01:10:57,470
but I'm going with him.

1395
01:10:57,514 --> 01:10:59,733
I'm gonna be there
every time he calls,

1396
01:10:59,777 --> 01:11:01,518
even at this age.

1397
01:11:01,561 --> 01:11:03,911
I'm gonna follow him
through the streets of New York.

1398
01:11:03,955 --> 01:11:07,306
It's okay because
I know, wherever he's going,

1399
01:11:07,350 --> 01:11:09,526

1400
01:11:11,484 --> 01:11:13,704

one of the houses recently,

1401
01:11:13,747 --> 01:11:14,966
and he said, "I'm so lucky.

1402
01:11:15,009 --> 01:11:16,837
"I'm so, so lucky

1403
01:11:16,881 --> 01:11:19,840
"that all of my friends
are here doing this for me.

1404
01:11:19,884 --> 01:11:23,017
Like, it doesn't escape me for
a second how grateful I am."

1405
01:11:23,061 --> 01:11:26,020
And then he looked at me in
the rearview mirror and said,

1406
01:11:26,064 --> 01:11:28,501
"And you're one
of my new friends."

1407
01:11:31,896 --> 01:11:33,593
- I've been really lucky
that I've been able

1408
01:11:33,637 --> 01:11:36,422
to live the life
that I have lived

1409
01:11:36,466 --> 01:11:39,860
and with the people
that have come into my life,

1410
01:11:39,904 --> 01:11:41,949
and to feel a part,

1411
01:11:41,993 --> 01:11:44,387
that we've all
created something,

1412
01:11:44,430 --> 01:11:47,607
because, you know,
it's just not all me.

1413
01:11:47,651 --> 01:11:51,959
It's me involving
everyone I can involve,

1414
01:11:52,003 --> 01:11:54,135
and everyone doing it.

1415
01:11:54,179 --> 01:11:55,615
And that, I love.

1416
01:11:55,659 --> 01:11:59,184
That's the we.
It's not the me.

1417
01:12:19,204 --> 01:12:20,379
- Good morning.

1418
01:12:20,423 --> 01:12:23,687

1419
01:12:23,730 --> 01:12:26,124

It's August 22nd,

1421
01:12:29,083 --> 01:12:33,958
and in the past 12 hours or so,

1422
01:12:34,001 --> 01:12:36,352
we've been accepted
to two film festivals.

1423

1424
01:12:38,441 --> 01:12:41,400
I got the first email
last night...

1425
01:12:41,444 --> 01:12:45,056
right before I drifted off
to sleep.

1426
01:12:45,099 --> 01:12:47,406
I was pretty excited.

1427
01:12:47,450 --> 01:12:50,409
And then this morning,
I wake up,

1428
01:12:50,453 --> 01:12:51,976
and what do you know?

1429
01:12:52,019 --> 01:12:56,415
We're accepted
to another film festival!

1430
01:12:56,459 --> 01:12:57,590
Two!

1431
01:12:57,634 --> 01:12:59,070
Hi!

1432
01:12:59,113 --> 01:13:00,158
- Hi.

1433
01:13:00,201 --> 01:13:03,379

1434
01:13:03,422 --> 01:13:04,554

1435
01:13:04,597 --> 01:13:06,251
- We did it.

1436
01:13:06,294 --> 01:13:08,732
[laughing]

1437
01:13:08,775 --> 01:13:09,950
Yeah!

1438
01:13:09,994 --> 01:13:12,649
Now the fun part begins.

1439
01:13:12,692 --> 01:13:15,565
Now it's gonna be the juice.

we're gonna poster the town.

My name is Kit.

1444
01:13:41,199 --> 01:13:43,419
I've got a card if you'd like.

1445
01:13:45,856 --> 01:13:47,161
- Hello, Miss.
- Farrell.

1446
01:13:47,205 --> 01:13:48,772
- I'm a filmmaker

1447
01:13:48,815 --> 01:13:50,426
who has a film
here in the film festival.

1448
01:13:50,469 --> 01:13:52,036
It's a short film.
It's just 20 minutes.

1449
01:13:52,079 --> 01:13:53,907
Let's stop by the cinemas

1450
01:13:53,951 --> 01:13:56,257
to see if our
big movie poster is up.

1451
01:13:56,301 --> 01:13:58,346
- Yeah.

1452
01:13:58,390 --> 01:14:01,480
- There it is!

1453
01:14:01,524 --> 01:14:04,788
- Oh, my God.

1454
01:14:04,831 --> 01:14:06,485
- Hey, everybody.

1455
01:14:06,529 --> 01:14:08,487
Right now, Kit Farrell
from "Pandora's Hope"

1456
01:14:08,531 --> 01:14:10,010
joins us right now.

1457
01:14:10,054 --> 01:14:11,708
Tell us about
this wonderful movie.

1458
01:14:11,751 --> 01:14:14,972
- Oh, I'm so excited
about this--my debut project.

1459
01:14:17,191 --> 01:14:20,804
Hawaii's island of Kauai
is many things to many people.

1460
01:14:20,847 --> 01:14:23,415
- Things that you normally
only read about

1461
01:14:23,459 --> 01:14:26,374
in "Discover Magazine"
or something.

1462
01:14:26,418 --> 01:14:29,465
It's not often you see
shark's teeth in a human.

1463
01:14:29,508 --> 01:14:33,120
But, you know, they're
functioning perfectly.

1464
01:14:48,048 --> 01:14:50,007
- I was wondering,
do we push this?

1465
01:14:50,050 --> 01:14:52,705
Do I go up there
and serve wine?

1466
01:14:52,749 --> 01:14:54,315
[laughter]

1467
01:14:54,359 --> 01:14:56,622
- With the teeth?
- With the teeth.

1468
01:15:00,365 --> 01:15:02,498
- To me, it's another level
of absurdity

1469
01:15:02,541 --> 01:15:06,850
that I can't stop myself
from wanting to do.

1470
01:15:13,900 --> 01:15:15,946
- People might find it odd

1471
01:15:15,989 --> 01:15:20,167
that you're using the stem
cells of a different species

1472
01:15:20,211 --> 01:15:22,561
for your research in humans.

1473
01:15:22,605 --> 01:15:27,348
- I had no idea that the teeth
would regenerate so quickly.

1474
01:15:27,392 --> 01:15:31,527
Every test that I did on him
was, you know, 100% normal.

1475
01:15:31,570 --> 01:15:35,095
It was as if Joe
was born with those teeth.

1476

1477
01:15:37,924 --> 01:15:39,709
- I'm Kit Farrell.

1478
01:15:39,752 --> 01:15:42,233
- That group was basically
to make it more transparent,

1479
01:15:42,276 --> 01:15:43,930
as they say.

1480
01:15:43,974 --> 01:15:46,150
- The man with the shark teeth?

1481
01:15:46,193 --> 01:15:47,499
I'm just curious,

1482
01:15:47,543 --> 01:15:49,588
why do the teeth regenerate
and--

1483
01:15:49,632 --> 01:15:52,983
- Yeah, yeah, so this is
xenotransplantation,

1484
01:15:53,026 --> 01:15:57,074
which I have come to find
is actually not that uncommon.

1485
01:15:57,117 --> 01:15:59,163
It has to do with stem cells.

1486
01:16:19,487 --> 01:16:23,970
- My stories may take off
and be an instant--

1487
01:16:24,014 --> 01:16:26,233
everyone has to read it.

1488
01:16:26,277 --> 01:16:30,673
Or they may be a slow,
in the back burner, you know,

1489
01:16:30,716 --> 01:16:34,372
takes time for this
to come around.

1490
01:16:34,415 --> 01:16:38,289
And I have to have
the openness,

1491
01:16:38,332 --> 01:16:41,901
the flexibility
to let that happen.

1492
01:16:45,165 --> 01:16:50,518
I have planted seeds
of thought.

1493
01:16:50,562 --> 01:16:55,088
And seeds of thought
hopefully will grow.

1494
01:17:01,834 --> 01:17:04,881
"Pandora's Hope" is now a film.

1495
01:17:04,924 --> 01:17:07,057
So it has a life.

1496
01:17:07,100 --> 01:17:10,321
It's not a newspaper article

1497
01:17:10,364 --> 01:17:12,279

is yesterday's news,

1498
01:17:12,323 --> 01:17:13,585

- Joey?
- Yes, yes.

1500
01:17:16,153 --> 01:17:19,504
- I'm actually calling
to tell you

1501
01:17:19,547 --> 01:17:23,160
that our film, "Pandora's Hope,"
has just been accepted

1502
01:17:23,203 --> 01:17:26,816
into the Big Apple Film Festival
in New York City.

1503
01:17:26,859 --> 01:17:28,165

1505

- That's fabulous.

1506
01:17:32,386 --> 01:17:37,435
In my heart,
I've always been the person

1507
01:17:37,478 --> 01:17:40,612
who is disturbed by things,

1508
01:17:40,656 --> 01:17:42,875
wants to see a change,

1509
01:17:42,919 --> 01:17:45,922
and looks for a way
in which to reach people

1510
01:17:45,965 --> 01:17:47,532
to ring the bell

1511
01:17:47,575 --> 01:17:50,317
to make those changes.

1512
01:17:50,361 --> 01:17:52,450
I'm gonna send out
the press release

about the film.

1516
01:18:06,594 --> 01:18:08,422

to get some friends

to be protestors
and protest the movie

1518
01:18:11,599 --> 01:18:15,342
because there's animal stem
cells being used in humans?

1519
01:18:15,386 --> 01:18:18,606
We're gonna have a demonstration
against the movie.

That's our evening
at a cathouse for dogs.

1561
01:22:01,960 --> 01:22:03,440
And it is for real,

1562
01:22:03,483 --> 01:22:06,269
and it is run
by Mr. Joseph Skaggs.

1563
01:22:06,312 --> 01:22:07,661
No kidding around.

1564
01:22:07,705 --> 01:22:09,402
This is it, right?

1565
01:22:09,446 --> 01:22:10,577
- Satisfaction guaranteed, Alex.

- I want to get you a live shot.

01:23:52,723 --> 01:23:54,420
This is a protest,

1571
01:23:54,464 --> 01:23:56,335
according to at least
one press release,

1572
01:23:56,379 --> 01:23:58,859
organized by an artist
named Joey Skaggs.

1573
01:23:58,903 --> 01:24:00,644
He has led this band

1574
01:24:00,687 --> 01:24:03,342
of outraged consumers
dressed as Muppets

1575
01:24:03,386 --> 01:24:05,083
down to Goldman
on West Street.

1576
01:24:05,127 --> 01:24:07,085
He's also peddling

1577
01:24:07,129 --> 01:24:09,609
what they're calling his mobile
homeless homes prototype.

1578
01:24:09,653 --> 01:24:11,176
It's what they're calling

1579
01:24:11,220 --> 01:24:13,222
a low-cost
alternative living space

1580
01:24:13,265 --> 01:24:15,180
for the millions of underwater

1581
01:24:15,224 --> 01:24:17,095
or foreclosed homeowners
in this country,

1582
01:24:17,139 --> 01:24:19,967
but Goldman clearly is not done
hearing about Muppets.

1583
01:25:12,150 --> 01:25:14,109
- Is this the last
of your hoaxes?

1584
01:25:14,152 --> 01:25:17,199
- Oh, sure.
