1
00:03:19,834 --> 00:03:21,744
Mom!

2
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:27,349
Max, please, go to sleep.
This is the fourth time

3
00:03:27,419 --> 00:03:28,532
you've called me in here.

4
00:03:28,604 --> 00:03:29,618
Third.

5
00:03:29,691 --> 00:03:32,331
This is the fifth time your mother's
had to come in here tonight.

6
00:03:32,348 --> 00:03:34,171
It's the fourth time, Jack.
Third!

7
00:03:34,236 --> 00:03:35,665
What's the problem?

8
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:37,628
He's staring at me!

9
00:03:39,837 --> 00:03:41,113
There you go.

10
00:03:41,181 --> 00:03:43,702
Now I can't tell what he's thinking.

11
00:03:45,693 --> 00:03:46,676
How's that?

12
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:47,733
Better.

13
00:03:48,574 --> 00:03:50,200
Good night, sweetie.

14
00:03:50,271 --> 00:03:51,994
Wait! The curtains!

15
00:03:52,575 --> 00:03:55,357
I fixed the curtains
the last time I came in here.

16
00:03:55,423 --> 00:03:57,114
You didn't like the shadows, remember?

17
00:03:57,183 --> 00:03:58,940
The shadow's worse.

18
00:03:59,008 --> 00:04:00,186
It's just the trees.

19
00:04:00,256 --> 00:04:01,816
I don't like trees.

20
00:04:01,888 --> 00:04:03,644
Look, is this better?

21
00:04:03,713 --> 00:04:05,688
Will you lie down with me?

22
00:04:06,305 --> 00:04:08,695
Honey, when I do that,
you don't go to sleep.

23
00:04:08,769 --> 00:04:10,079
You just want to talk.

24
00:04:10,146 --> 00:04:13,048
I won't. I promise. Please!

25
00:04:13,185 --> 00:04:16,896
Here's the deal. Max, if you can get to sleep
without calling us into the room again,

26
00:04:16,945 --> 00:04:19,865
I'll get you that video game
you've been wanting, Ultra Gorgonzola or...

27
00:04:19,939 --> 00:04:21,663
Ultimate Gonzago?
Right!

28
00:04:21,731 --> 00:04:22,679
Jack!

29
00:04:22,755 --> 00:04:24,250
I'm out of ideas, Eileen.

30
00:04:24,771 --> 00:04:27,073
Okay, Mom. I love you.

31
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:29,115
We love you, too, sweetie.

32
00:04:29,508 --> 00:04:31,035
Good night, Dad.

33
00:04:31,109 --> 00:04:32,353
Good night, buddy boy.

34
00:05:34,606 --> 00:05:36,548
That's what you get
for wrecking my DVD player,

35
00:05:36,622 --> 00:05:37,570
you little brat!

36
00:05:37,646 --> 00:05:38,628
It was an accident!

37
00:05:38,702 --> 00:05:41,572
Yeah, and I was accidentally
hiding in your closet.

38
00:05:41,647 --> 00:05:44,331
I'm not scared of that thing.
It's just rubber.

39
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:47,334
True, but the real one is out there.

40
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,131
Mom!

41
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,410
Goodbye video game.

42
00:05:55,089 --> 00:05:56,682
He's fine. I reassured him.

43
00:05:56,753 --> 00:05:57,768
Liar!

44
00:05:57,841 --> 00:05:58,921
Did you scare him again?

45
00:05:58,994 --> 00:06:00,303
No!
Yes!

46
00:06:00,369 --> 00:06:02,704
You know, you're gonna go
too far one of these days.

47
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:04,050
Tell him to stay out of my room.

48
00:06:04,051 --> 00:06:06,794
He's just trying to be
closer to you, Cassie.

49
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:10,147
Look, this is a new adjustment for him.
It's a new neighborhood. It's a new home.

50
00:06:10,148 --> 00:06:11,850
Why is everything always about him?

51
00:06:12,884 --> 00:06:14,575
What...
Cass...

52
00:07:18,141 --> 00:07:20,989
Cassie? You're gonna
be late for school.

53
00:07:22,941 --> 00:07:25,593
Do you have to dress like that every day?

54
00:07:26,942 --> 00:07:28,885
Get out of my room.

55
00:07:29,406 --> 00:07:30,868
Fangs? What's it about?

56
00:07:30,943 --> 00:07:32,437
If I told you, you'd have nightmares.

57
00:07:33,567 --> 00:07:37,245
All right, now, how about
that outfit that I bought for you?

58
00:07:37,472 --> 00:07:38,454
Aha.

59
00:07:38,528 --> 00:07:41,278
Now, this would look darling on you.

60
00:07:41,344 --> 00:07:42,293
Yuck!

61
00:07:43,617 --> 00:07:47,130
You know, you might make new friends
if you didn't try so hard to be different.

62
00:07:47,201 --> 00:07:49,143
I liked my old friends.

63
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:52,290
Honey, I know it's awkward
to be dropped into a new school,

64
00:07:52,291 --> 00:07:57,147
especially after the semester has started,
but look, listen, just give it some time.

65
00:07:57,475 --> 00:07:59,297
It'll get better.

66
00:07:59,363 --> 00:08:00,608
Right.

67
00:08:02,084 --> 00:08:03,993
Cassie?

68
00:08:24,038 --> 00:08:26,821
When everything you have goes away

69
00:08:28,743 --> 00:08:31,558
You realize that nothing means a thing

70
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:36,321
And everything you thought was a big deal

71
00:08:37,961 --> 00:08:40,896
Now you see it all and what is real

72
00:08:42,345 --> 00:08:44,735
When all you have just falls apart

73
00:08:44,905 --> 00:08:48,419
And nothing seems to work out right
You're trying

74
00:08:50,987 --> 00:08:53,834
And you're still all right

75
00:08:53,899 --> 00:08:55,077
Hey, Sean!

76
00:08:55,148 --> 00:08:56,293
Hey, what's up, man?

77
00:08:56,396 --> 00:08:59,396
And you're still all right

78
00:08:59,596 --> 00:09:03,142
Hey, write down your address, dude.
My mom needs it for some list thing.

79
00:09:03,212 --> 00:09:05,100
Oh, all right, sure.

80
00:09:07,534 --> 00:09:09,290
The shocker pen!

81
00:09:09,358 --> 00:09:11,049
Oh, cool!

82
00:09:13,582 --> 00:09:14,531
Ah!

83
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:16,552
Dude, you're not supposed to like it.

84
00:09:16,623 --> 00:09:17,605
Oh, really?

85
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:18,791
Yeah, really.

86
00:09:18,862 --> 00:09:21,099
Well, how do you like it, huh? How...

87
00:09:21,615 --> 00:09:24,299
Here, take it back.
All right, here, man.

88
00:09:37,521 --> 00:09:41,002
McKIBBLE ON P. A: Attention students.
This is Principal McKibble reminding you

89
00:09:41,074 --> 00:09:45,036
that today is the last day to cast your
ballots for this year's Pumpkin Queen.

90
00:09:45,107 --> 00:09:47,343
Remember, your vote counts.

91
00:09:47,411 --> 00:09:48,785
I know we're gonna win.

92
00:09:48,851 --> 00:09:50,193
Don't worry.
You can't lose.

93
00:09:50,259 --> 00:09:52,398
Good luck!
I don't need luck.

94
00:09:53,171 --> 00:09:54,298
Okay, about the party,

95
00:09:54,299 --> 00:09:56,619
good idea with our costumes,
and I think we should match.

96
00:09:57,493 --> 00:09:59,453
I'll e-mail you a list
of what you guys can wear

97
00:09:59,733 --> 00:10:03,247
because fashion is important,
so I'll pick your outfits.

98
00:10:03,414 --> 00:10:05,553
I think my daddy's gonna get me a limo.

99
00:10:05,622 --> 00:10:07,247
He is?
A pink one.

100
00:10:07,318 --> 00:10:09,107
Are you serious?
That's so cool!

101
00:10:09,174 --> 00:10:10,254
I know!

102
00:10:11,639 --> 00:10:12,587
Hi, Sean.

103
00:10:12,663 --> 00:10:13,873
What's up, Priscilla?

104
00:10:14,551 --> 00:10:15,827
Hey, Priscilla.

105
00:10:15,895 --> 00:10:17,554
He's so hot.

106
00:10:17,624 --> 00:10:20,079
I wonder who he's taking to the dance.

107
00:10:20,152 --> 00:10:21,811
Who do you think?

108
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,603
He asked you?

109
00:10:23,672 --> 00:10:24,818
He will.

110
00:10:27,673 --> 00:10:29,583
I'm hungry!

111
00:10:37,371 --> 00:10:39,313
Ain't you gonna eat that?

112
00:10:40,635 --> 00:10:41,583
What's wrong, bro?

113
00:10:41,659 --> 00:10:42,608
I'm toast.

114
00:10:42,715 --> 00:10:46,196
My English paper is due next Friday,
and I'm only this far in this stupid book.

115
00:10:47,164 --> 00:10:49,586
Why'd you pick such a thick book?

116
00:10:49,661 --> 00:10:51,832
The cover looked cool.
I don't know.

117
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:56,025
See, I never pick a book bigger than this.
So you're not gonna eat that?

118
00:10:56,093 --> 00:10:59,061
If I get another D,
my dad's not gonna let me play ball.

119
00:10:59,646 --> 00:11:00,791
That's harsh.

120
00:11:00,862 --> 00:11:03,994
He's on my case 24-7.
He called me an idiot.

121
00:11:04,542 --> 00:11:05,491
Dang!

122
00:11:05,567 --> 00:11:07,290
Look at this thing.

123
00:11:07,358 --> 00:11:09,147
That would be like 10 books for me.

124
00:11:09,215 --> 00:11:11,004
I've read that book.

125
00:11:11,071 --> 00:11:12,184
What?

126
00:11:12,256 --> 00:11:14,045
I said, I've read that book.

127
00:11:14,112 --> 00:11:15,705
I've read all of Poe's work.

128
00:11:15,776 --> 00:11:17,303
Really? Cool.

129
00:11:18,336 --> 00:11:19,580
Here. Take it.

130
00:11:19,648 --> 00:11:21,558
Poe, of course, is a seminal figure

131
00:11:21,633 --> 00:11:24,317
in horror literature.
He was a master

132
00:11:24,385 --> 00:11:27,866
at creating the intense
atmosphere of poetic dread.

133
00:11:29,442 --> 00:11:32,192
And, of course,
Poe's self-torture protagonists

134
00:11:32,259 --> 00:11:34,648
have become a horror convention.

135
00:11:34,723 --> 00:11:37,723
Oh, I've never been
to a horror convention.

136
00:11:38,372 --> 00:11:40,347
Hey, Pris, you got competition.

137
00:11:41,732 --> 00:11:43,259
That new girl?

138
00:11:43,333 --> 00:11:47,741
The living-dead reject?
I don't think so.

139
00:11:47,813 --> 00:11:50,334
Hey, aren't you in one of my classes?

140
00:11:50,406 --> 00:11:53,755
I'm in your English class.
I sit right in front of you.

141
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:55,740
My name's Cassie.

142
00:11:55,814 --> 00:11:57,953
Sean. Yeah, I've seen you.

143
00:11:59,847 --> 00:12:04,255
Maybe if you're having trouble, you know,
getting through the book, I could...

144
00:12:04,327 --> 00:12:05,505
Hi.

145
00:12:05,575 --> 00:12:06,622
What's up?

146
00:12:06,695 --> 00:12:07,743
Yeah, what's up?

147
00:12:07,816 --> 00:12:09,096
What are you guys talking about?

148
00:12:09,097 --> 00:12:11,586
Sean's flipping over some term paper.

149
00:12:11,656 --> 00:12:15,170
Oh, poor baby.
I'll help you.

150
00:12:15,241 --> 00:12:16,189
Really?

151
00:12:16,265 --> 00:12:19,168
I'll be your tutor
after school all next week

152
00:12:19,241 --> 00:12:21,609
at my house.

153
00:12:23,786 --> 00:12:24,833
Cool.

154
00:12:24,906 --> 00:12:28,038
And we'll talk about it more at the dance

155
00:12:28,107 --> 00:12:31,490
if you'll take me.

156
00:12:31,563 --> 00:12:32,676
Sure, okay.

157
00:12:32,748 --> 00:12:35,334
Great, okay!
Pick me up at 7:00. Don't be late.

158
00:12:36,236 --> 00:12:37,218
Oh!

159
00:12:37,292 --> 00:12:40,227
And by the way, didn't anyone tell you?

160
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:43,018
The Halloween dance
isn't until next Friday.

161
00:12:51,246 --> 00:12:53,156
Oh, my God!

162
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:02,382
Wait! Leave it.
It's an improvement.

163
00:13:10,033 --> 00:13:10,982
Oops.

164
00:13:12,881 --> 00:13:14,921
Come sit down there's plenty of room

165
00:13:14,994 --> 00:13:17,580
There's room for you right here

166
00:13:17,778 --> 00:13:21,391
Next to me, here by my side

167
00:13:22,034 --> 00:13:26,607
There's nothing that you should hide
from a friend, or is there?

168
00:13:26,899 --> 00:13:28,623
You just look at me

169
00:13:29,011 --> 00:13:33,322
Don't smile or just stare too hard, too long

170
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:38,418
Now I know, I know
that something's wrong with you

171
00:13:39,733 --> 00:13:45,844
I can talk to you, I can see you
What's going on inside?

172
00:13:46,198 --> 00:13:48,370
What are you running from?

173
00:13:49,815 --> 00:13:51,954
Why do you want to hide?

174
00:13:53,879 --> 00:13:57,557
Tell me what's on your mind, what you feel

175
00:13:57,752 --> 00:13:59,956
What do you believe?

176
00:14:00,025 --> 00:14:04,532
What is inside you that makes you scream?

177
00:14:05,209 --> 00:14:09,072
Cassie, look what I got!
It's a pirate costume, a real pirate costume!

178
00:14:09,145 --> 00:14:10,672
And...
The word is "knock."

179
00:14:10,745 --> 00:14:13,201
I'm gonna go try the rest of it on!

180
00:14:16,314 --> 00:14:18,103
Would you tell him to stay out of my room?

181
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:19,447
He's excited.

182
00:14:19,515 --> 00:14:20,660
How was school?

183
00:14:20,731 --> 00:14:21,811
Sucks.

184
00:14:22,364 --> 00:14:24,731
Isn't there a Halloween dance on Friday?

185
00:14:24,795 --> 00:14:25,973
I guess.

186
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:31,316
Oh, right, sweetie. Don't worry
because a boy didn't ask you to go.

187
00:14:31,389 --> 00:14:33,331
Who cares?

188
00:14:33,405 --> 00:14:34,812
Boys your age are shy.

189
00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:39,005
I remember not wanting to go
to a dance because no one asked me.

190
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:41,143
I was the same age you are now.

191
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:44,476
But my mother insisted that I go,
and I ended up having so much fun.

192
00:14:44,543 --> 00:14:46,518
I can unpack my own stuff.

193
00:14:47,359 --> 00:14:50,621
Well, just give what I said
some thought, okay?

194
00:15:05,058 --> 00:15:07,611
Max, you're supposed to be helping me.

195
00:15:09,251 --> 00:15:11,390
So that's how it's gonna be, huh?

196
00:15:11,459 --> 00:15:13,630
I'm going down to the library.
Anyone need anything?

197
00:15:13,699 --> 00:15:15,805
Starbucks?
Something else?

198
00:15:16,836 --> 00:15:17,785
No, I'm fine.

199
00:15:17,859 --> 00:15:19,583
Oh, before I forget, Monday night,

200
00:15:19,652 --> 00:15:22,652
Halloween, your father and I have a party
we have to go to, so we need you

201
00:15:22,724 --> 00:15:24,153
to take Max
trick-or-treating.

202
00:15:24,228 --> 00:15:26,465
What? That's my favorite
night of the year!

203
00:15:27,237 --> 00:15:29,823
Aren't you getting
a little old for trick-or-treating?

204
00:15:29,893 --> 00:15:32,447
It's my boss's party, Cass.
Gotta go.

205
00:15:32,806 --> 00:15:35,589
Great. I get to tote
the little baby around.

206
00:15:35,654 --> 00:15:37,793
I'm not a baby, stupid head!

207
00:15:39,175 --> 00:15:41,597
Hey, we don't ask that much of you.

208
00:15:43,016 --> 00:15:44,958
Thanks a lot.

209
00:15:45,543 --> 00:15:48,263
Hey, you know, come to think of it,
I could go for a non-fat latte.

210
00:15:48,328 --> 00:15:50,303
I'm not going that way.

211
00:16:05,418 --> 00:16:09,031
When you see me walking
down the street all alone

212
00:16:12,044 --> 00:16:15,786
It's because I'm headed
for the whitewater dome

213
00:16:18,573 --> 00:16:22,796
So check the windows
The lights are out and nobody's home

214
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:30,635
And everything that I ever loved
somehow is gone, gone, gone

215
00:16:32,463 --> 00:16:36,075
If you see me walking
down the street all alone

216
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:45,161
It's because I'm headed
for the whitewater dome

217
00:16:48,273 --> 00:16:50,859
Cassie.

218
00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:53,385
Cassie.

219
00:18:20,159 --> 00:18:22,101
May I help you?

220
00:18:28,736 --> 00:18:30,645
May I help you?

221
00:18:32,864 --> 00:18:33,813
Um...

222
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,023
Well, I've never seen this store before.

223
00:18:37,089 --> 00:18:39,545
We're only here for Halloween.

224
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:41,079
I see.

225
00:18:41,505 --> 00:18:43,840
You like scary things, don't you?

226
00:18:45,602 --> 00:18:47,162
Usually.

227
00:18:47,234 --> 00:18:49,209
It's fun to scare people, isn't it?

228
00:18:53,795 --> 00:18:55,770
Come on, you love it.

229
00:18:56,676 --> 00:18:59,873
So where do you get all this stuff?

230
00:18:59,941 --> 00:19:01,402
I'm a collector.

231
00:19:14,343 --> 00:19:16,383
Well, thank you.
I think I have to...

232
00:19:16,455 --> 00:19:18,179
I see you like to read.

233
00:19:22,568 --> 00:19:23,615
I do.

234
00:19:23,688 --> 00:19:25,117
Let me show you the book section.

235
00:19:25,192 --> 00:19:27,265
Actually, I have to go.

236
00:19:33,097 --> 00:19:35,006
Hello again.

237
00:19:36,682 --> 00:19:38,657
Feel free to browse.

238
00:19:45,771 --> 00:19:48,008
This is the book section?

239
00:19:48,075 --> 00:19:50,443
Did you want quality or quantity?

240
00:19:51,148 --> 00:19:53,734
The sign says, "Books,"
not, "Book."

241
00:19:53,805 --> 00:19:55,812
I'll have the "S" removed.

242
00:19:57,421 --> 00:19:59,363
Please.

243
00:20:13,967 --> 00:20:18,223
The Evil Thing. Sounds scary.

244
00:20:19,184 --> 00:20:20,428
May I see it?

245
00:20:20,497 --> 00:20:21,544
Certainly.

246
00:20:37,138 --> 00:20:38,600
It's locked.

247
00:20:38,675 --> 00:20:41,992
When you buy, you get the key.

248
00:20:46,804 --> 00:20:48,266
Perhaps it's not for you.

249
00:20:48,341 --> 00:20:49,650
How much is it?

250
00:20:51,253 --> 00:20:53,195
How much would you pay?

251
00:20:54,869 --> 00:20:56,844
Five dollars?
Sold.

252
00:20:58,486 --> 00:21:01,486
The Evil Thing is yours.

253
00:21:03,127 --> 00:21:05,069
The key.

254
00:21:09,335 --> 00:21:11,245
Not here.

255
00:22:18,401 --> 00:22:19,881
McKIBBLE ON P. A: Attention students.

256
00:22:20,161 --> 00:22:22,977
We have the election results
for our new Pumpkin Queen,

257
00:22:23,042 --> 00:22:25,660
but, first, a reminder.
When you're at the dance,

258
00:22:25,730 --> 00:22:29,047
remember to practice safe dancing
and not dance too close.

259
00:22:29,123 --> 00:22:31,327
I wouldn't want
to have to separate any of you.

260
00:22:31,395 --> 00:22:33,435
And now for the election results.

261
00:22:33,507 --> 00:22:38,243
The enthusiasm of the entire student body
was wonderful. Who says you don't care?

262
00:22:38,308 --> 00:22:42,433
The winner and new Pumpkin Queen
is Priscilla Wright!

263
00:22:52,231 --> 00:22:55,614
Guess that makes you Mr. Pumpkin Queen.

264
00:22:58,567 --> 00:22:59,941
Oh, man!

265
00:23:01,576 --> 00:23:03,896
So what's the big deal
about being Pumpkin Queen, anyway?

266
00:23:04,873 --> 00:23:08,583
Oh, it's a beautiful tradition.

267
00:23:09,321 --> 00:23:13,730
The poetry, the music, the pita.

268
00:23:14,858 --> 00:23:16,352
My date. My date.

269
00:23:16,426 --> 00:23:17,354
Pita?

270
00:23:17,418 --> 00:23:18,727
Yes, the pumpkin pita.

271
00:23:18,827 --> 00:23:23,399
Oh, it's so festive.
Only the Queen is allowed to hit it open.

272
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:26,885
Queen Priscilla?

273
00:23:26,956 --> 00:23:28,385
Her Majesty.

274
00:23:35,021 --> 00:23:37,443
Turn it off! It's scary.

275
00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:43,114
Turn it off!

276
00:23:43,182 --> 00:23:45,604
Honey, you wanted Ultimate Gonzago.

277
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:48,941
I want a different game.
It's scary.

278
00:23:49,007 --> 00:23:52,455
Max, it's a squirrel who throws nut bombs.

279
00:23:52,528 --> 00:23:54,667
I don't care!

280
00:23:54,736 --> 00:23:55,816
Yes! Yes!

281
00:23:55,888 --> 00:23:56,836
All right, that's it.

282
00:23:56,912 --> 00:23:58,538
Yeah, that's right.

283
00:23:59,249 --> 00:24:01,158
It's for me.

284
00:24:01,873 --> 00:24:02,822
Hi, delivery.

285
00:24:02,896 --> 00:24:03,879
Thanks.

286
00:24:03,953 --> 00:24:05,677
Have a good day.
What is it?

287
00:24:05,745 --> 00:24:07,884
UPS. Stuff for the dance.

288
00:24:07,953 --> 00:24:09,644
I thought you weren't going to the dance.

289
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:13,294
Remember you said to give it
some thought? So I did.

290
00:24:15,186 --> 00:24:17,161
Okay. Ooh!

291
00:24:37,686 --> 00:24:41,035
Do you want a revolution?

292
00:24:41,558 --> 00:24:44,079
Crown institution

293
00:24:44,695 --> 00:24:47,477
How about a big black car?

294
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:51,280
Honey, I don't know who you are

295
00:24:54,169 --> 00:24:55,860
Which one will it be?

296
00:24:56,409 --> 00:24:58,198
I want to sing for you

297
00:24:58,265 --> 00:25:00,721
I want to sing for you

298
00:25:04,186 --> 00:25:08,081
Don't kick me down the road

299
00:25:08,219 --> 00:25:11,253
Really, baby, it's time to go

300
00:25:12,027 --> 00:25:15,191
Would you shout out Come on

301
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:17,682
Baby, baby Turn the world out now

302
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:21,301
What's wrong with you?

303
00:25:25,149 --> 00:25:28,183
What's wrong with you?
Yeah

304
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:49,528
Hey, guys, Mr. McKibble
wants you at the main gate

305
00:25:49,601 --> 00:25:50,910
to help unload some equipment.

306
00:25:50,977 --> 00:25:51,959
The main gate?

307
00:25:52,033 --> 00:25:54,106
Yeah, not sure.
Some audio-visual stuff, I think.

308
00:25:54,177 --> 00:25:56,544
I thought we were only on pita duty.

309
00:26:11,844 --> 00:26:13,754
Get in there. Go! Go! Go!

310
00:26:39,624 --> 00:26:43,967
What was that about?
Mr. McKibble did not want us. Bogus.

311
00:26:50,729 --> 00:26:52,388
How about those skeletons, huh?

312
00:26:52,458 --> 00:26:55,425
How about a round of applause
for the skeletons?

313
00:26:55,498 --> 00:26:58,499
Great job! Good job! Great job!

314
00:26:59,275 --> 00:27:02,592
Happy Halloween, everybody.
You know, as your principal,

315
00:27:02,667 --> 00:27:05,450
I am proud that, tonight,
we are going to carry on

316
00:27:05,516 --> 00:27:07,905
a very special tradition.
Oh, yeah!

317
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:10,501
All right!
Tonight, are you ready for it?

318
00:27:14,349 --> 00:27:16,684
I'm sorry. I didn't hear you.
Are you ready for it?

319
00:27:17,869 --> 00:27:22,572
Yes! May I present to you
this year's Pumpkin Queen,

320
00:27:22,638 --> 00:27:25,901
Priscilla Wright!
Come forth and be crowned!

321
00:27:31,824 --> 00:27:34,060
Here is your glory.

322
00:27:37,201 --> 00:27:39,176
And here is your power.

323
00:27:43,570 --> 00:27:48,305
I command a mighty pumpkin
to feed my loyal subjects.

324
00:27:50,066 --> 00:27:53,383
Smash it! Smash it! Smash it!

325
00:27:53,459 --> 00:27:56,558
Smash it! Smash it! Smash it!

326
00:28:21,174 --> 00:28:22,931
Roaches!

327
00:28:22,999 --> 00:28:24,755
They're crawling all over the place!

328
00:28:24,823 --> 00:28:25,805
Help me! Help me!

329
00:28:26,264 --> 00:28:28,686
Just get them! Kill them!

330
00:28:28,952 --> 00:28:30,414
Ew!

331
00:28:32,856 --> 00:28:34,799
She fell in the cake!

332
00:29:09,278 --> 00:29:12,857
Hey, Priscilla,
I heard you're opening your own motel!

333
00:29:14,367 --> 00:29:16,309
It's the Cockroach Queen!

334
00:29:17,887 --> 00:29:18,869
Where is she going?

335
00:29:18,943 --> 00:29:19,925
Quick! Step on her!

336
00:29:19,999 --> 00:29:22,239
Hey, Priscilla,
what are you using for hairspray, Raid?

337
00:29:22,271 --> 00:29:24,344
Hey, don't hurt her feelers.

338
00:29:28,384 --> 00:29:31,232
Where are you going, Priscilla?
Behind the stove?

339
00:29:36,962 --> 00:29:39,134
I know it was you.

340
00:29:39,202 --> 00:29:40,184
Prove it.

341
00:29:40,259 --> 00:29:41,666
You are so dead.

342
00:29:45,539 --> 00:29:47,995
Tonight is Halloween.

343
00:29:49,252 --> 00:29:51,554
Who knows when Halloween started?

344
00:29:52,837 --> 00:29:54,976
I thought I might see your hand, Cassie.

345
00:29:58,181 --> 00:30:00,931
Halloween started with the Celts
in what is now Ireland

346
00:30:00,997 --> 00:30:03,387
around, like, 2,000 years ago.

347
00:30:03,942 --> 00:30:05,349
Go on, Cassie.

348
00:30:05,415 --> 00:30:07,935
The Celts celebrated
the end of the harvest

349
00:30:08,006 --> 00:30:10,210
and the beginning
of the days getting shorter

350
00:30:10,279 --> 00:30:12,188
and the nights getting longer.

351
00:30:12,263 --> 00:30:15,559
These long, dark nights
made people think about death,

352
00:30:16,968 --> 00:30:18,724
as they do today.

353
00:30:18,792 --> 00:30:21,760
Yes. Yes, I suppose that's true.

354
00:30:23,305 --> 00:30:26,023
But does anyone know

355
00:30:27,369 --> 00:30:30,403
where the custom
for dressing up for Halloween...

356
00:30:31,466 --> 00:30:32,611
Yes, Cassie?

357
00:30:32,682 --> 00:30:35,400
The Celts believed
that on the night of October 31st,

358
00:30:35,467 --> 00:30:39,112
the boundary between the living
and the dead became blurred.

359
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:43,523
They thought that on this night,
the ghost of the dead came back to Earth.

360
00:30:52,045 --> 00:30:55,788
They would build big bonfires
and dress up in animal masks and skins

361
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:58,789
to frighten away the spirits,
but then, over time,

362
00:30:58,862 --> 00:31:01,994
it changed into All Hallows
because the Church taught

363
00:31:02,063 --> 00:31:04,332
that you were supposed to hallow the dead.

364
00:31:04,398 --> 00:31:06,603
That's very impressive, Cassie.

365
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,695
Okay, get out your notebooks.

366
00:31:11,792 --> 00:31:16,527
Let's talk about term papers.

367
00:31:21,905 --> 00:31:25,070
I can't wait till October 31st

368
00:31:25,490 --> 00:31:28,654
I'm so excited that my
sweet tooth's gonna burst

369
00:31:28,722 --> 00:31:34,058
I'll be the one with the chocolate in my eye

370
00:31:36,051 --> 00:31:39,849
I can't wait till October 31st
It's my Halloween song

371
00:31:39,924 --> 00:31:43,153
I can't wait till October 31st
It's my Halloween song

372
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:47,182
I can't wait till October 31st
It's my Halloween song

373
00:31:54,582 --> 00:31:56,492
This thing itches.

374
00:31:57,559 --> 00:31:59,567
You're barely wearing a costume anymore.

375
00:31:59,639 --> 00:32:01,679
Can you hold my bag?
It's heavy.

376
00:32:01,752 --> 00:32:04,021
Let's go.
You have enough stuff.

377
00:32:04,535 --> 00:32:08,049
Hey, guys, look,
they're giving away wax lips with fangs!

378
00:32:08,121 --> 00:32:10,991
Wax lips! I love wax lips!

379
00:32:23,483 --> 00:32:25,425
Go on.

380
00:32:37,053 --> 00:32:38,841
Go on.

381
00:32:38,909 --> 00:32:40,370
I don't like that music.

382
00:32:40,445 --> 00:32:43,479
Then let's go. I have homework to do,
and you have enough candy.

383
00:32:43,549 --> 00:32:46,233
I don't have wax lips.
They're my favorites.

384
00:32:46,302 --> 00:32:48,724
Then go up there.
It's just music.

385
00:32:50,463 --> 00:32:54,937
Look, toddlers
are going up there. Go on!

386
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:01,269
I can't!

387
00:33:01,344 --> 00:33:02,970
Then we're going home.

388
00:33:03,041 --> 00:33:04,502
I want wax lips.

389
00:33:04,576 --> 00:33:05,689
Then go!

390
00:33:05,761 --> 00:33:07,768
I can't!

391
00:33:07,841 --> 00:33:10,329
Look, a ladybug is going up there.

392
00:33:10,401 --> 00:33:12,955
Are you a bigger chicken than a ladybug?

393
00:33:13,026 --> 00:33:14,138
Maybe.

394
00:33:15,522 --> 00:33:19,385
Think how good it'll feel when you're brave.
You'll go, "It wasn't so hard."

395
00:33:19,459 --> 00:33:22,307
Won't that be good to say,
"It wasn't so hard"?

396
00:33:22,371 --> 00:33:23,648
I can't!

397
00:33:23,716 --> 00:33:25,145
Do you want me to go for you?

398
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:28,122
No, everyone will see me
and know I'm scared.

399
00:33:28,196 --> 00:33:31,011
Then you go! See you later.

400
00:33:34,565 --> 00:33:36,540
Wait!

401
00:33:37,829 --> 00:33:38,877
Can you breathe?
No.

402
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:41,667
Okay, that works for me.

403
00:33:43,527 --> 00:33:45,534
Mom! Dad!
Hey!

404
00:33:45,606 --> 00:33:47,035
Cassie left me alone!

405
00:33:47,111 --> 00:33:48,540
You what?

406
00:33:48,615 --> 00:33:51,266
I just started walking.
I didn't "leave him alone."

407
00:33:51,335 --> 00:33:55,046
Liar! You left me,
and I didn't get wax lips with fangs.

408
00:33:56,264 --> 00:33:58,206
All right, we'll get you wax lips, all right?

409
00:33:58,281 --> 00:33:59,525
Look, just go.

410
00:34:00,073 --> 00:34:03,390
Fine, let's go.
Why can't we just do this tomorrow, buddy?

411
00:34:03,465 --> 00:34:04,545
No, I really want them now!

412
00:34:04,553 --> 00:34:05,698
All right, let's go.

413
00:34:06,825 --> 00:34:08,964
Let's go! Let's go! Here!
Come on! Hurry up!

414
00:34:11,946 --> 00:34:13,157
Hold on! Don't...

415
00:34:14,667 --> 00:34:17,602
I don't know what it will take
to get you to be nice to your brother.

416
00:34:17,676 --> 00:34:19,498
A miracle?

417
00:34:19,563 --> 00:34:21,603
Can I count on you for one simple thing?

418
00:34:24,461 --> 00:34:29,027
I'm leaving this roast out to defrost
for tomorrow. In a couple of hours,

419
00:34:29,028 --> 00:34:30,628
please put it in the refrigerator, okay?

420
00:34:30,701 --> 00:34:31,683
Okay.

421
00:34:31,757 --> 00:34:35,074
All right, now, we're gonna be out late,
but I want Max in bed by 9:00.

422
00:34:35,150 --> 00:34:37,572
Please, Cassie, try to get along.

423
00:34:38,351 --> 00:34:39,463
I'll try.

424
00:34:39,534 --> 00:34:41,128
And no scary stories for Max.

425
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:42,955
Do you understand?
Whatever.

426
00:34:47,216 --> 00:34:50,696
Bye, Mom. Bye, Dad.
Have a great time!

427
00:34:58,993 --> 00:35:02,823
Excellent. This will be even better.

428
00:35:04,242 --> 00:35:07,952
Is this gonna take a long time?
John Carlucci's having a party.

429
00:35:08,019 --> 00:35:10,289
Forget John Carlucci.

430
00:35:10,835 --> 00:35:14,152
Put that stupid shocker-pen thing away.
It's retarded.

431
00:35:17,621 --> 00:35:19,628
Why don't we just forget this?

432
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:22,864
Well, why don't we forget me
writing your term paper?

433
00:35:23,637 --> 00:35:24,585
You promised.

434
00:35:24,661 --> 00:35:25,970
Then get with the program,

435
00:35:26,037 --> 00:35:28,209
and let me do the thinking.

436
00:35:28,278 --> 00:35:29,805
I can think. I'm not stupid.

437
00:35:29,878 --> 00:35:32,497
Doesn't matter.
You're cute. Let's go.

438
00:36:01,531 --> 00:36:03,604
You're supposed to be in bed.
Give me that.

439
00:36:03,675 --> 00:36:05,617
Read me that story.
No, it's too scary.

440
00:36:05,691 --> 00:36:07,153
I like scary stuff.

441
00:36:07,228 --> 00:36:08,242
You do not.

442
00:36:08,315 --> 00:36:10,421
On Halloween, I do. Honest.

443
00:36:10,492 --> 00:36:12,572
Get in bed, and I'll read you
The Berenstain Bears.

444
00:36:12,573 --> 00:36:14,834
I hate those stupid bears.
I want this book.

445
00:36:14,909 --> 00:36:15,891
Forget it.

446
00:36:32,927 --> 00:36:34,040
Hey!

447
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:44,023
What?

448
00:36:45,633 --> 00:36:47,576
What did you do?
Nothing.

449
00:36:48,097 --> 00:36:49,080
What did you do?

450
00:36:49,153 --> 00:36:50,364
It was an accident!

451
00:36:50,434 --> 00:36:52,194
You turned this off?
You did it on purpose.

452
00:36:52,226 --> 00:36:53,208
It was an accident!

453
00:36:53,283 --> 00:36:56,123
Do you know what you did? You made me
lose everything I wrote tonight!

454
00:36:56,124 --> 00:36:58,688
Hours of work!
I'll never remember exactly what I wrote!

455
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:02,842
What are you gonna do?

456
00:37:08,837 --> 00:37:10,910
You wanted me to read you this book, right?

457
00:37:10,981 --> 00:37:13,021
You're not mad anymore?

458
00:37:13,093 --> 00:37:14,337
Accidents happen.

459
00:37:20,998 --> 00:37:22,908
"The Evil Thing.

460
00:37:26,343 --> 00:37:29,572
"The Evil Thing is a gruesome beast.

461
00:37:30,504 --> 00:37:33,636
"On living flesh, it loves to feast.

462
00:37:34,792 --> 00:37:39,812
"It's a two-headed thing
whom you don't wish to greet.

463
00:37:39,881 --> 00:37:44,737
"One head sucks your blood.
One head chews your meat.

464
00:37:46,250 --> 00:37:50,179
"It carries its babies
in slimy eggs on its back.

465
00:37:51,595 --> 00:37:54,978
"The babies are hungry,
when they hatch, for a snack,

466
00:37:56,715 --> 00:38:00,458
"so the Evil Thing traps
some poor victim alive

467
00:38:01,197 --> 00:38:04,939
"for the babies to eat
when their birthdays arrive.

468
00:38:05,997 --> 00:38:09,926
"But don't worry. Don't cry.
Please don't have a fit.

469
00:38:11,213 --> 00:38:16,332
"The Evil Thing is not real
unless you think about it.

470
00:38:18,831 --> 00:38:22,410
"Remember, don't think about it."

471
00:38:29,329 --> 00:38:31,303
Good night.

472
00:38:37,618 --> 00:38:41,677
Don't think about it.
Don't think about it. Don't think about it.

473
00:38:48,115 --> 00:38:50,898
I thought about it! I thought about it!

474
00:38:50,964 --> 00:38:54,313
Cassie, I thought about it!
I thought about it! I couldn't help it!

475
00:38:54,388 --> 00:38:57,007
Now it's alive!
The Evil Thing is alive!

476
00:38:57,269 --> 00:38:58,217
Uh-oh.

477
00:38:58,453 --> 00:39:02,196
You shouldn't have done that.
Now it's gonna get you.

478
00:39:14,455 --> 00:39:16,692
I'm just kidding you, Max.
It's not gonna get you.

479
00:39:16,759 --> 00:39:17,807
Yes, it is!

480
00:39:17,879 --> 00:39:19,505
No, it's not. Stop crying.

481
00:39:19,576 --> 00:39:21,813
It's gonna trap me
and feed me to its babies!

482
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:22,829
It's not.

483
00:39:22,905 --> 00:39:24,017
It's gonna put me in a sac!

484
00:39:24,088 --> 00:39:26,358
No, it's not.
It's just a made-up story.

485
00:39:26,456 --> 00:39:30,134
The Evil Thing isn't real.
Honest. I just wanted to scare you.

486
00:39:34,874 --> 00:39:37,046
Really?

487
00:39:37,114 --> 00:39:38,521
I swear.

488
00:40:13,888 --> 00:40:17,817
Here's your pizza.
All right, let... Oh, yeah.

489
00:40:17,889 --> 00:40:18,904
Here you go.

490
00:40:18,976 --> 00:40:20,187
Thank you.

491
00:40:20,257 --> 00:40:23,389
All right, you have a good night. Yeah.

492
00:40:26,145 --> 00:40:28,928
Happy, happy Halloween! Yeah.

493
00:40:29,698 --> 00:40:31,673
Thanks for the candy corn.

494
00:40:33,922 --> 00:40:35,352
Great tip.

495
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:43,290
Where to next?

496
00:41:07,367 --> 00:41:12,157
Hey, guy, great costume, yeah.
You scared me.

497
00:41:13,225 --> 00:41:15,494
Could you get off the car?

498
00:41:16,617 --> 00:41:20,545
Thank you, yeah.
Have a good Halloween.

499
00:41:24,043 --> 00:41:25,952
That was a good costume.

500
00:41:31,627 --> 00:41:33,766
Here, take the pizzas.

501
00:42:48,246 --> 00:42:49,294
Not again.

502
00:42:49,367 --> 00:42:50,643
Cassie!

503
00:42:54,967 --> 00:42:57,040
Don't go, Cassie! Don't go!

504
00:42:57,112 --> 00:42:58,606
It's just a blown fuse.

505
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:00,142
It's the Thing, the Evil Thing!

506
00:43:00,216 --> 00:43:01,296
Quiet.

507
00:43:07,609 --> 00:43:10,926
Cassie, it's the Evil Thing!
Let's go, Cassie!

508
00:43:12,090 --> 00:43:15,985
Cassie, let's go! It's gonna get us!
Cassie, let's go! Come on!

509
00:43:16,059 --> 00:43:18,132
Let's get back in the house!

510
00:43:23,355 --> 00:43:25,494
Cassie, let's go! Come on!

511
00:43:36,797 --> 00:43:38,008
What...

512
00:43:38,078 --> 00:43:41,307
"Don't worry. Don't cry.

513
00:43:41,791 --> 00:43:44,279
"Please, don't have a fit.

514
00:43:44,351 --> 00:43:48,661
"The Evil Thing isn't real
unless you think about it."

515
00:43:49,279 --> 00:43:52,443
Everyone at school
is gonna want to see this video.

516
00:43:53,504 --> 00:43:55,260
Don't you think so, Sean?

517
00:43:55,329 --> 00:43:56,506
I guess.

518
00:43:57,665 --> 00:43:58,810
Are you okay, buddy?

519
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:01,630
But, wait, you mean it's all fake?

520
00:44:02,881 --> 00:44:05,402
The Evil Thing.

521
00:44:05,474 --> 00:44:07,547
What about the growls?

522
00:44:12,131 --> 00:44:13,625
That's cool.

523
00:44:13,699 --> 00:44:18,718
And now on video,
Cassie Keller does the dance of fear.

524
00:44:23,781 --> 00:44:26,018
It's an instant classic.

525
00:44:26,085 --> 00:44:27,808
You were so scared.

526
00:44:28,165 --> 00:44:29,627
Give me that tape. Right now!

527
00:44:29,702 --> 00:44:30,847
Not likely.

528
00:44:30,917 --> 00:44:35,140
Next time, loser,
remember who you're messing with.

529
00:44:40,327 --> 00:44:42,432
I would have been scared, too.

530
00:44:45,384 --> 00:44:47,172
Cassie's a chicken! Cassie's a...

531
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:48,614
Get in the house!

532
00:45:01,930 --> 00:45:04,484
I can't believe
how scared you were out there.

533
00:45:04,555 --> 00:45:07,075
You were like the world's
biggest chicken ever.

534
00:45:07,147 --> 00:45:09,286
Oh, my gosh, you are so annoying!

535
00:45:09,355 --> 00:45:12,290
Yeah, whatever,
you almost wet your pants, you big baby!

536
00:45:12,363 --> 00:45:14,469
You were even worse than that.

537
00:45:16,076 --> 00:45:19,492
You're such a big baby.
Stop eating that, and go to bed!

538
00:45:19,853 --> 00:45:20,801
Huh!

539
00:45:23,053 --> 00:45:24,996
And don't forget to brush your teeth.

540
00:45:25,070 --> 00:45:26,728
Whatever!

541
00:47:07,068 --> 00:47:09,076
Cassie, I know it's you.

542
00:47:10,654 --> 00:47:13,272
Cassie, quit or I'm telling Mom and Dad!

543
00:47:16,606 --> 00:47:19,028
Quit what? Go to sleep, you big baby.

544
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:31,990
Cassie!

545
00:47:32,064 --> 00:47:33,658
Knock it off!

546
00:49:00,685 --> 00:49:05,323
Throw a fit. Go ahead.
See if I care. Little brat!

547
00:49:59,414 --> 00:50:00,821
I love this.

548
00:50:00,886 --> 00:50:02,774
Okay, I think you've watched it enough.

549
00:50:02,838 --> 00:50:04,781
I'm going to John Carlucci's party.

550
00:50:04,854 --> 00:50:07,059
It gets better every time.

551
00:50:08,376 --> 00:50:10,285
Let me see.

552
00:50:13,144 --> 00:50:14,322
What are you doing?

553
00:50:14,393 --> 00:50:16,302
I don't like it, okay?
It's too mean.

554
00:50:16,376 --> 00:50:17,656
You better give that back to me!

555
00:50:17,688 --> 00:50:18,671
I don't think so.

556
00:50:18,744 --> 00:50:21,909
If you don't put that tape
in my hand right this instant,

557
00:50:21,977 --> 00:50:26,134
I will not write your term paper,
and you will fail!

558
00:50:27,034 --> 00:50:28,441
I don't care.

559
00:50:28,506 --> 00:50:30,579
Your dad's gonna kill you!

560
00:50:30,682 --> 00:50:32,788
Sean! You loser!

561
00:50:35,195 --> 00:50:39,287
Well, who's supposed
to carry this stuff, huh?

562
00:51:04,095 --> 00:51:09,334
Sean? Is that you?
Sean, quit fooling around!

563
00:51:10,464 --> 00:51:14,720
Sean, I mean it. Cut it out.
Sean, stop it right now.

564
00:51:19,074 --> 00:51:21,016
Sean, stop!

565
00:51:27,075 --> 00:51:28,984
Such a bad actress.

566
00:52:20,651 --> 00:52:23,040
Help me! Help me! Help!

567
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:32,804
Somebody help!
Somebody help me! Help! Somebody help!

568
00:52:50,159 --> 00:52:54,502
Open up! It's me, Sean! It's an emergency!
Open up! It's me, Sean!

569
00:52:57,713 --> 00:52:59,142
Back for an encore?

570
00:52:59,217 --> 00:53:00,657
It's got your brother and Priscilla!

571
00:53:00,689 --> 00:53:03,275
Look, okay, you got me.
You scared me. You have it on tape.

572
00:53:03,345 --> 00:53:05,625
Why don't you call it a night?
Wait, wait, no. No, wait!

573
00:53:05,626 --> 00:53:10,665
No, this is no joke, okay?
That Evil Thing, it's real, the whole deal!

574
00:53:10,738 --> 00:53:12,681
It's got your brother!

575
00:53:13,363 --> 00:53:16,746
Well, it can't be
because this is my brother right here.

576
00:53:16,819 --> 00:53:19,405
I killed him,
and we'll be eating him for dinner later.

577
00:53:20,148 --> 00:53:24,524
No, I'm not kidding, okay?
It's got Priscilla, too!

578
00:53:24,596 --> 00:53:26,539
Well, I guess it's not totally evil.

579
00:53:27,221 --> 00:53:30,385
Gosh! I'm telling the truth.
It's out in the woods!

580
00:53:32,853 --> 00:53:36,748
Why don't you believe me?
Okay, where do you think your brother is?

581
00:53:36,822 --> 00:53:37,804
Sleeping.

582
00:53:37,878 --> 00:53:39,307
No. No. Go take a look!

583
00:53:40,694 --> 00:53:41,840
I'm being punk'd, right?

584
00:53:41,911 --> 00:53:43,886
Where's his room? Up here?

585
00:53:44,855 --> 00:53:47,856
Hey, you can't...
Where do you think you're going?

586
00:53:49,975 --> 00:53:52,823
What are you doing? What...

587
00:53:52,888 --> 00:53:54,165
See?

588
00:53:54,232 --> 00:53:55,443
Max!

589
00:53:56,857 --> 00:53:57,871
Is he in on this?

590
00:53:57,945 --> 00:54:00,499
It must have dragged him out through here.

591
00:54:05,594 --> 00:54:06,641
Ugh!

592
00:54:08,603 --> 00:54:10,392
You are telling the truth, aren't you?

593
00:54:10,459 --> 00:54:12,728
Your brother is gonna be toast!

594
00:54:13,083 --> 00:54:15,043
I ignored the warning.
I read the book out loud.

595
00:54:15,099 --> 00:54:17,304
I just wanted to scare him.

596
00:54:17,372 --> 00:54:19,132
Well, good job.
We've got to call the cops.

597
00:54:19,133 --> 00:54:22,522
On Halloween? They'll never believe us,
and by the time we can convince them,

598
00:54:22,589 --> 00:54:25,851
it'll be too late.
We have to do something now.

599
00:54:28,222 --> 00:54:30,295
We have to kill that thing.

600
00:54:32,062 --> 00:54:33,972
What?

601
00:55:13,572 --> 00:55:16,921
What is that? Let me out!

602
00:55:18,052 --> 00:55:20,257
Cassie! Cassie!

603
00:55:20,326 --> 00:55:23,009
Hello? Is anybody else in here?

604
00:55:27,302 --> 00:55:29,189
Help! Somebody help me! Help!

605
00:55:30,023 --> 00:55:32,031
Priscilla's shoe.

606
00:55:32,102 --> 00:55:35,681
It was right here.
It had your brother in its...

607
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:40,353
I don't know what you call it.
The... Slimy and...

608
00:55:40,424 --> 00:55:42,247
Are you sure it was Max?

609
00:55:42,312 --> 00:55:44,800
Pretty sure. He was whimpering.

610
00:55:44,873 --> 00:55:46,531
A whiny, irritating whimper?

611
00:55:46,601 --> 00:55:47,616
Yeah.

612
00:55:47,689 --> 00:55:49,599
That's Max.

613
00:55:51,242 --> 00:55:53,152
Look.

614
00:55:53,354 --> 00:55:54,303
Oh!

615
00:55:54,570 --> 00:55:56,545
Come on, I think it went this way.

616
00:55:58,347 --> 00:56:03,879
A walking stick? Are you sure your dad
doesn't have a shotgun or something?

617
00:56:05,516 --> 00:56:07,425
Max? Where are you?

618
00:56:08,972 --> 00:56:10,052
What do you think?

619
00:56:10,124 --> 00:56:12,034
I think it could use a tissue.

620
00:56:12,557 --> 00:56:13,670
You're a weird girl.

621
00:56:13,741 --> 00:56:14,723
I know.

622
00:56:15,469 --> 00:56:18,371
I'm sure the Priscillas
of the world are more your type.

623
00:56:18,445 --> 00:56:23,018
I don't know. She's Priscilla,
but, dang, I don't think she deserves to die.

624
00:56:24,399 --> 00:56:26,985
That cockroach deal,
I mean, that was kind of over the top.

625
00:56:27,055 --> 00:56:28,484
She deserved that.

626
00:56:28,559 --> 00:56:29,541
I don't know.

627
00:56:29,615 --> 00:56:34,285
I mean, so she dissed you?
Be cool. Whatever.

628
00:56:34,992 --> 00:56:37,643
What are you so
ticked-off about, anyway?

629
00:56:37,712 --> 00:56:40,680
And your brother,
I mean, what did he do to you?

630
00:56:41,137 --> 00:56:43,079
He annoys me.

631
00:56:44,146 --> 00:56:45,094
Ouch!

632
00:56:52,562 --> 00:56:56,141
So you think I'm weird, huh?

633
00:56:57,044 --> 00:57:01,517
No, I mean, in a good way.

634
00:57:02,004 --> 00:57:02,952
Different.

635
00:57:03,028 --> 00:57:05,679
Yeah, but not pretty like Priscilla.

636
00:57:06,709 --> 00:57:08,618
I don't know.

637
00:57:09,365 --> 00:57:10,892
Well, you know, 'cause she's all...

638
00:57:10,965 --> 00:57:12,940
And all...

639
00:57:13,750 --> 00:57:16,303
Yeah, but you're...

640
00:57:17,559 --> 00:57:19,469
Nasty!

641
00:57:23,383 --> 00:57:26,253
For a minute, I forgot
we were in the middle of a nightmare.

642
00:57:32,088 --> 00:57:35,635
Sean, listen, you don't have to do this.

643
00:57:35,706 --> 00:57:38,357
I mean it. None of this was your fault.

644
00:57:40,250 --> 00:57:44,659
No biggie.
John Carlucci's parties suck anyway.

645
00:57:53,980 --> 00:57:55,890
Come on.

646
00:58:10,462 --> 00:58:12,405
This way.

647
00:58:14,207 --> 00:58:16,095
Are you sure?

648
00:58:29,473 --> 00:58:31,132
Sean!

649
00:58:31,201 --> 00:58:32,695
Sorry. Big shoes.

650
00:58:41,699 --> 00:58:43,226
Gosh!

651
00:58:43,299 --> 00:58:45,209
I hate these webs.

652
00:58:55,204 --> 00:58:56,153
What? What?

653
00:58:56,229 --> 00:58:57,953
Something just ran over my foot.

654
00:58:58,022 --> 00:58:59,997
Just keep moving.

655
00:59:06,790 --> 00:59:08,733
There's no more slime.

656
00:59:10,535 --> 00:59:12,445
Which way?

657
00:59:12,520 --> 00:59:14,047
This way.

658
00:59:33,387 --> 00:59:35,329
Where are we?

659
00:59:46,540 --> 00:59:48,133
Ew. Ugh.

660
00:59:56,526 --> 00:59:58,566
Oh, my.

661
01:00:00,814 --> 01:00:02,757
Oh, my gosh!

662
01:00:03,887 --> 01:00:05,894
Maybe it's out.

663
01:00:05,967 --> 01:00:07,429
Foraging?

664
01:00:08,112 --> 01:00:10,862
Well, I doubt it went to the market.

665
01:00:11,632 --> 01:00:13,836
Come on, let's make this fast.

666
01:00:16,945 --> 01:00:21,485
Max? Max? Max?

667
01:00:21,554 --> 01:00:26,224
Cassie! Help!
Somebody help me! Help! Please! Help!

668
01:00:26,290 --> 01:00:27,273
Max?

669
01:00:27,346 --> 01:00:29,037
Help! Help!

670
01:00:29,106 --> 01:00:31,081
Max, are you okay?
Help!

671
01:00:31,155 --> 01:00:32,617
Max?
Oh, my gosh!

672
01:00:32,691 --> 01:00:35,026
Max, just calm down. We'll get you out.

673
01:00:36,275 --> 01:00:38,316
Come on. Oh, my gosh!

674
01:00:40,916 --> 01:00:42,989
Here. Here. Pull this.

675
01:00:45,205 --> 01:00:47,060
Sean? What did you have for dinner?

676
01:00:47,126 --> 01:00:49,996
I was just about
to ask you the same thing.

677
01:01:03,511 --> 01:01:06,097
I think we're gonna need bigger sticks.

678
01:01:15,129 --> 01:01:16,536
Run!

679
01:01:22,906 --> 01:01:24,848
This way! This way!

680
01:01:30,460 --> 01:01:31,387
Come on!

681
01:01:31,451 --> 01:01:33,590
Go! Go! Go! Faster! Faster!

682
01:01:34,460 --> 01:01:36,403
Sean, watch behind...

683
01:01:39,549 --> 01:01:41,524
He's got my leg!

684
01:01:46,494 --> 01:01:50,172
Sean! Come on!

685
01:01:51,935 --> 01:01:53,877
Shocker pen!

686
01:02:00,416 --> 01:02:01,660
That was a fiasco.

687
01:02:01,728 --> 01:02:03,550
Yeah, and it didn't work, either.

688
01:02:04,192 --> 01:02:06,102
Why did you have
to read that book out loud?

689
01:02:06,177 --> 01:02:07,704
I've got issues, okay?

690
01:02:07,778 --> 01:02:09,949
I mean, what is that book?

691
01:02:10,017 --> 01:02:11,032
Where did it come from?

692
01:02:11,106 --> 01:02:12,994
The Halloween store.

693
01:02:13,058 --> 01:02:15,262
The Halloween store! Of course!

694
01:02:15,330 --> 01:02:17,240
Wait. Wait. What Halloween store?

695
01:02:17,315 --> 01:02:19,006
He knew all along it would happen!

696
01:02:19,075 --> 01:02:20,395
Well, who knew what would happen?

697
01:02:20,396 --> 01:02:21,820
The weirdo who sold me the book!

698
01:02:21,891 --> 01:02:23,200
What weirdo?

699
01:02:23,267 --> 01:02:26,170
He knows the magic.
He has to! Come on!

700
01:02:32,133 --> 01:02:36,389
Hello? Hello? Open!
Open up, please! He's not here.

701
01:02:38,213 --> 01:02:39,904
Wait... Oh, come on! Come on! Come on!

702
01:02:42,214 --> 01:02:44,156
Hey, wait!

703
01:02:44,582 --> 01:02:45,728
Sorry, no refunds.

704
01:02:45,799 --> 01:02:47,774
You knew the book was magic.

705
01:02:47,847 --> 01:02:50,215
As I recall,

706
01:02:50,279 --> 01:02:54,240
there's a warning
plainly printed on the first page.

707
01:02:54,312 --> 01:02:56,866
But the Evil Thing is alive,
and it has my brother!

708
01:02:56,937 --> 01:03:00,003
Aren't you the girl
who likes to scare people?

709
01:03:00,073 --> 01:03:04,296
It's a powerful feeling,
to watch others cringe in fear.

710
01:03:04,362 --> 01:03:07,362
I bet you can't wait
to see the frightened expression

711
01:03:07,434 --> 01:03:11,810
on your brother's face
when he sees those babies hatch.

712
01:03:11,883 --> 01:03:15,363
Yes! No, I can wait.
I don't want to see that expression.

713
01:03:15,435 --> 01:03:18,251
Well, you should have thought
of that before.

714
01:03:18,987 --> 01:03:24,356
Oh, well. Buyer's remorse.
Happens all the time in the retail trade.

715
01:03:25,549 --> 01:03:27,459
But there has to be something you can do.

716
01:03:27,533 --> 01:03:30,500
No, there has to be something you can do.

717
01:03:32,589 --> 01:03:35,688
You brought
the Evil Thing from the darkness.

718
01:03:35,759 --> 01:03:39,371
Now you must figure out
how to return it there.

719
01:03:40,687 --> 01:03:42,214
But you sold me the book.

720
01:03:42,287 --> 01:03:44,458
But you brought me to this town.

721
01:03:44,527 --> 01:03:46,316
You did?
I did not.

722
01:03:46,383 --> 01:03:51,567
But you did. It was your wish
to scare people that summoned me.

723
01:03:51,952 --> 01:03:56,230
Every Halloween, I choose the one
who wants to scare people the most.

724
01:03:56,305 --> 01:04:01,008
This year, it was between you
and a nine-year-old in Detroit. You won.

725
01:04:02,578 --> 01:04:04,521
Congratulations.

726
01:04:06,771 --> 01:04:08,651
But there has to be
something you can sell me,

727
01:04:08,652 --> 01:04:10,158
something from the store.

728
01:04:10,227 --> 01:04:11,339
Store?

729
01:04:14,036 --> 01:04:15,945
What store?

730
01:04:17,076 --> 01:04:19,760
It's gone. It was just right here. What...

731
01:04:21,525 --> 01:04:23,947
There has to be some way to kill it.

732
01:04:26,293 --> 01:04:31,029
Two heads are better than one.
That's the way to get the bloody job done.

733
01:04:34,199 --> 01:04:36,141
Happy Halloween.

734
01:04:45,496 --> 01:04:47,918
Well, what does that mean?

735
01:04:47,993 --> 01:04:48,975
Huh?

736
01:04:49,049 --> 01:04:51,121
What he said,
"Two heads are better than one.

737
01:04:51,193 --> 01:04:53,528
"That's the way to get the bloody job done."

738
01:04:53,593 --> 01:04:54,673
I don't know.

739
01:04:54,745 --> 01:04:55,825
Well, it's a riddle.

740
01:04:56,602 --> 01:04:59,385
Maybe it means our heads,
like the expression.

741
01:04:59,450 --> 01:05:03,826
"Two heads are better than one."
Like two heads can think better.

742
01:05:03,899 --> 01:05:07,828
That's the obvious meaning, but in a riddle,
you look for the meaning that's not obvious.

743
01:05:07,899 --> 01:05:10,355
Sorry, I wasn't in class that day.

744
01:05:10,428 --> 01:05:12,949
For example, the Evil Thing has two heads.

745
01:05:13,021 --> 01:05:14,461
Well, how can that be better for us?

746
01:05:14,462 --> 01:05:15,863
I know. That's the problem.

747
01:05:15,933 --> 01:05:18,169
Unless they fought each other.

748
01:05:18,238 --> 01:05:19,514
Say that again.

749
01:05:20,829 --> 01:05:22,739
Unless they fought each other?

750
01:05:22,814 --> 01:05:24,276
Yes! You're brilliant!

751
01:05:24,350 --> 01:05:25,398
I am?

752
01:05:25,470 --> 01:05:27,445
But how do we get them to do that?

753
01:05:27,519 --> 01:05:29,374
Do what?
Fight each other!

754
01:05:29,439 --> 01:05:30,387
How?

755
01:05:30,463 --> 01:05:31,707
I don't know.

756
01:05:31,775 --> 01:05:36,315
Bloody job. Bloody job.
What would you need for a bloody job?

757
01:05:38,432 --> 01:05:40,342
Blood?

758
01:05:42,785 --> 01:05:44,727
And I know where to get some. Come on!

759
01:05:50,370 --> 01:05:52,280
Cassie!

760
01:05:53,186 --> 01:05:56,635
Cassie! Cassie! Help! Help!

761
01:06:16,294 --> 01:06:19,229
Okay, here's the plan.
We lure the Evil Thing toward us.

762
01:06:19,302 --> 01:06:21,724
When it gets close,
we throw the blood on it.

763
01:06:21,799 --> 01:06:24,669
That will cause the sucking head
to attack its own body.

764
01:06:24,743 --> 01:06:27,875
When it draws its own blood,
the other head will go into a frenzy.

765
01:06:27,943 --> 01:06:29,569
And then it will devour itself.

766
01:06:29,640 --> 01:06:31,201
Two heads are better than one.

767
01:06:32,520 --> 01:06:33,469
That's really smart.

768
01:06:33,544 --> 01:06:34,559
I know!

769
01:06:34,633 --> 01:06:36,033
I don't know what's gotten into me.

770
01:06:36,034 --> 01:06:38,149
But how do we lure it into our trap?

771
01:06:39,113 --> 01:06:40,226
Uh...

772
01:06:40,585 --> 01:06:42,047
I don't know.

773
01:06:43,274 --> 01:06:45,795
I know. With its mate.

774
01:06:45,866 --> 01:06:46,849
It has a mate?

775
01:06:46,923 --> 01:06:48,264
Doesn't everything?

776
01:06:49,962 --> 01:06:51,872
Forget I said that.

777
01:07:02,092 --> 01:07:04,459
Help! Somebody help me!

778
01:07:05,324 --> 01:07:09,995
Help! Help! Help!
Help me! Help, please! Help!

779
01:07:12,782 --> 01:07:14,921
Max, please don't be baby food.

780
01:07:18,223 --> 01:07:20,132
Help!

781
01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:23,149
Help! Help!

782
01:07:24,304 --> 01:07:27,086
Help! Help! Help!

783
01:07:44,050 --> 01:07:46,025
Come on.

784
01:07:47,635 --> 01:07:49,643
Sorry.

785
01:07:54,068 --> 01:07:56,403
Help! Somebody help me! Help!

786
01:07:56,501 --> 01:07:59,184
Oh, no! The babies have hatched.

787
01:07:59,253 --> 01:08:01,325
Help! Help!

788
01:08:01,397 --> 01:08:02,477
Hurry.

789
01:08:02,549 --> 01:08:04,110
But I don't see the Evil Thing.

790
01:08:04,182 --> 01:08:06,899
As long as it doesn't see us.
Just start the mating call.

791
01:08:06,966 --> 01:08:08,766
How do we know
that this is the mating call?

792
01:08:08,767 --> 01:08:10,156
It showed up before.

793
01:08:12,279 --> 01:08:14,614
It better not try to mate with me.

794
01:08:45,083 --> 01:08:47,026
Sounds like love to me.

795
01:09:01,950 --> 01:09:06,174
Keep coming, big mama.
Come on. Come on.

796
01:09:06,975 --> 01:09:08,884
There we go.

797
01:09:14,335 --> 01:09:16,245
Come on.

798
01:09:17,952 --> 01:09:19,862
Get ready.

799
01:09:24,673 --> 01:09:26,583
What?

800
01:09:27,298 --> 01:09:29,240
Oh, no.

801
01:09:31,971 --> 01:09:35,768
Here, the blood! No, you do it! You do it!
Yeah, but you're supposed... No, you...

802
01:09:36,195 --> 01:09:38,105
No!

803
01:09:41,060 --> 01:09:43,002
Help me! Help! Please, help!

804
01:09:57,254 --> 01:09:58,301
Max! Max!

805
01:09:58,374 --> 01:10:00,513
Max, watch out! On the ground!

806
01:10:00,582 --> 01:10:01,565
Max, the pitcher!

807
01:10:01,638 --> 01:10:02,816
What pitcher?

808
01:10:02,887 --> 01:10:04,830
Max!

809
01:10:07,336 --> 01:10:09,246
Oh, no!

810
01:10:09,512 --> 01:10:13,572
Max, grab the pitcher! The pitcher
right in front of you! Grab it! The pitcher!

811
01:10:13,641 --> 01:10:15,812
Pick it up! Pick it up!
Pick it up! Pick it up!

812
01:10:15,881 --> 01:10:17,376
What is it?
It's blood.

813
01:10:17,450 --> 01:10:18,627
Blood!

814
01:10:18,697 --> 01:10:21,381
Pick it up! Pick it up!
Pick it up! Pick it up!

815
01:10:22,826 --> 01:10:24,736
Throw it on the Evil Thing!
What?

816
01:10:24,810 --> 01:10:26,534
Throw it on the Evil Thing!

817
01:10:26,602 --> 01:10:27,879
I'm scared!

818
01:10:27,947 --> 01:10:28,896
You're not!

819
01:10:29,035 --> 01:10:30,245
I can't! I'm too scared!

820
01:10:30,315 --> 01:10:32,323
No, you're not.
You can do it. Throw the blood.

821
01:10:32,396 --> 01:10:33,705
I can't!

822
01:10:33,772 --> 01:10:35,627
Look at me.

823
01:10:38,092 --> 01:10:40,743
I love you, Max. You can do it.

824
01:10:45,038 --> 01:10:47,427
Help me!

825
01:11:00,719 --> 01:11:03,207
It's working. It's attacking itself.

826
01:11:42,742 --> 01:11:46,158
Yes! You did it, Max!

827
01:11:46,231 --> 01:11:47,278
Way to go, little dude!

828
01:11:47,351 --> 01:11:48,366
Yes!

829
01:11:49,143 --> 01:11:51,052
It wasn't so hard.

830
01:11:56,407 --> 01:11:57,356
Ew!

831
01:12:07,321 --> 01:12:09,296
Get off of me!

832
01:12:10,170 --> 01:12:12,691
Calm down. It's just me.

833
01:12:12,762 --> 01:12:15,097
She's a witch!

834
01:12:15,162 --> 01:12:17,334
I'm sorry.
I didn't want any of this to happen.

835
01:12:17,403 --> 01:12:20,153
Get away from me! My dad's a lawyer.

836
01:12:22,235 --> 01:12:24,178
Let's go, Sean.

837
01:12:25,692 --> 01:12:27,635
Sean, are you coming?

838
01:12:28,892 --> 01:12:30,802
Sean!

839
01:12:34,142 --> 01:12:36,149
I think I'll walk Cassie home.

840
01:12:36,221 --> 01:12:37,530
You will?

841
01:12:39,166 --> 01:12:42,462
I am disgusted! I'm the Pumpkin Queen!

842
01:12:43,071 --> 01:12:45,275
Hello? Is anybody else in here?

843
01:12:51,008 --> 01:12:54,074
Hear me and hear me good.
I've got a complimentary large pizza

844
01:12:54,144 --> 01:12:58,847
with two toppings,
your choice, coming at you. I'm serious.

845
01:13:01,665 --> 01:13:03,935
Could you get me down from here?

846
01:13:04,546 --> 01:13:06,302
Yeah. Yeah, sure. Here.

847
01:13:06,370 --> 01:13:07,548
Come on. Oh, right here.

848
01:13:07,618 --> 01:13:09,888
Be careful.
Grab my hand. Here.

849
01:13:13,731 --> 01:13:15,673
Hey, wait up.

850
01:13:17,892 --> 01:13:20,063
Hey, you need a ride?

851
01:13:20,132 --> 01:13:21,539
In your dreams!

852
01:13:26,021 --> 01:13:29,338
Is it the car?
I mean, the slime can come right off.

853
01:13:30,726 --> 01:13:32,733
Looks good. I'm hungry.

854
01:13:36,230 --> 01:13:37,824
This is yummy.

855
01:13:37,895 --> 01:13:39,651
Pizza dude was cool.
Mmm-hmm.

856
01:13:41,543 --> 01:13:44,544
Here you go. Monster-stain free.

857
01:13:44,616 --> 01:13:45,794
Thank you.

858
01:13:46,824 --> 01:13:49,028
Hey, you don't look so bad
in my dad's clothes.

859
01:13:49,096 --> 01:13:51,071
Yeah, I'll grow into them.

860
01:13:54,057 --> 01:13:55,967
Ready?

861
01:14:02,667 --> 01:14:04,128
Okay.

862
01:14:04,202 --> 01:14:05,631
Do it.

863
01:14:05,707 --> 01:14:07,649
Can I do it?

864
01:14:09,515 --> 01:14:11,425
Careful.

865
01:14:51,345 --> 01:14:53,255
What a night.

866
01:14:56,562 --> 01:15:01,680
Oh, dang. I gotta jet.
My dad is gonna kill me.

867
01:15:03,316 --> 01:15:07,342
Hey, Max, thanks for saving my life.
You're a brave kid.

868
01:15:07,923 --> 01:15:10,739
Oh, but you got
some pepperoni on your shirt.

869
01:15:30,263 --> 01:15:33,329
I can't believe
I still have to write that term paper.

870
01:15:33,399 --> 01:15:34,861
And I haven't even started yet.

871
01:15:34,936 --> 01:15:36,245
I'll write it for you.

872
01:15:37,785 --> 01:15:40,949
Oh, thanks, but, you know,
I should probably finally write

873
01:15:41,017 --> 01:15:42,960
my own term paper.
I'll tutor you.

874
01:15:44,825 --> 01:15:46,735
At my house.

875
01:15:48,058 --> 01:15:50,033
All right, cool.

876
01:15:58,523 --> 01:16:00,433
Stay weird.

877
01:16:10,749 --> 01:16:15,321
Cassie, will you read me
The Berenstain Bears Go to Camp?

878
01:16:17,822 --> 01:16:20,189
You got it. Come on.

879
01:16:36,513 --> 01:16:38,193
So did you think I made a good impression?

880
01:16:38,194 --> 01:16:40,354
Yeah, I'm sure we can replace
that helmet collection.

881
01:16:42,146 --> 01:16:44,219
Looks like the house is still standing.

882
01:16:44,290 --> 01:16:47,130
Yeah, it's a good sign. I wonder if
the kids got along. This is itchy.

883
01:16:47,131 --> 01:16:50,178
Yeah, well, let's not hold our breath.
After you, sir.

884
01:16:52,803 --> 01:16:54,746
Yeah.

885
01:16:58,756 --> 01:17:01,145
Eileen, come on. Come on.

886
01:17:04,293 --> 01:17:06,050
Oh, my!

887
01:17:06,118 --> 01:17:07,580
Now, there's a sight, huh?

888
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:28,739
Looks like the kids started a fire.

889
01:17:28,808 --> 01:17:31,078
Oh, good. Put another log on there.

890
01:17:31,145 --> 01:17:33,534
Honey, what happened
to all the fireplace tools?

891
01:17:33,609 --> 01:17:35,551
I have no idea.

892
01:17:51,948 --> 01:17:53,858
Look at this.

893
01:17:55,052 --> 01:17:56,459
Look what I found in the fire.

894
01:17:56,525 --> 01:17:58,314
I could have sworn I left a roast out.

895
01:18:01,613 --> 01:18:02,595
Look at this.

896
01:18:02,669 --> 01:18:03,978
What? Look at what?

897
01:18:04,718 --> 01:18:05,700
What is that?

898
01:18:05,774 --> 01:18:08,774
I'm trying to tell you. A strange
little book I found in the fireplace.

899
01:18:08,846 --> 01:18:09,926
What's it doing there?

900
01:18:09,998 --> 01:18:11,340
You got me.

901
01:18:11,407 --> 01:18:14,408
Wait a minute.
You know what? I know I left a roast out.

902
01:18:14,480 --> 01:18:16,968
Listen to this. "Do not read aloud."

903
01:18:18,383 --> 01:18:20,391
Read it.

904
01:18:20,464 --> 01:18:24,294
"The Evil Thing is a gruesome beast.

905
01:18:24,369 --> 01:18:27,533
"On living flesh, it loves to feast.

906
01:18:29,809 --> 01:18:33,639
"It's a two-headed thing
whom you don't wish to greet.

907
01:18:33,714 --> 01:18:37,031
"One head sucks your blood.
One head chews your meat."

908
01:18:37,107 --> 01:18:39,049
Oh, God.
This is great.

909
01:18:39,123 --> 01:18:43,401
"It carries its babies
in slimy eggs on its back.

910
01:18:43,828 --> 01:18:47,690
"The babies are hungry,
when they hatch, for a snack,

911
01:18:48,341 --> 01:18:53,011
"so the Evil Thing traps
some poor victim alive

912
01:18:53,077 --> 01:18:56,787
"for the babies to eat
when their birthdays arrive.

913
01:18:56,853 --> 01:19:01,229
"But don't worry. Don't cry.
Please don't have a fit.

914
01:19:01,590 --> 01:19:06,741
"The Evil Thing is not real
unless you think about it."

915
01:19:08,087 --> 01:19:09,327
How can you not think about it?

916
01:19:15,096 --> 01:19:17,038
Happy Halloween.

917
01:19:22,042 --> 01:19:23,252
Sounds good.

918
01:19:23,321 --> 01:19:24,561
Yeah, let's do it. Let's do it.

919
01:19:24,698 --> 01:19:27,698
Emily Osment.
I Don't think About It. Tapes rolling.

920
01:19:27,770 --> 01:19:30,072
I don't think about it

921
01:19:30,202 --> 01:19:32,308
I don't think about it

922
01:19:36,507 --> 01:19:42,204
Misunderstood
Everybody feels that way sometimes

923
01:19:42,844 --> 01:19:44,306
Oh

924
01:19:44,989 --> 01:19:49,627
I wish I could fit with all the rest but I

925
01:19:50,973 --> 01:19:52,500
Oh

926
01:19:53,054 --> 01:19:57,015
Got my own style Got my own way

927
01:19:57,246 --> 01:19:59,668
I don't care what people say

928
01:19:59,871 --> 01:20:02,806
Yeah, 'cause I don't think about it

929
01:20:03,103 --> 01:20:04,859
I don't think about it

930
01:20:04,928 --> 01:20:06,837
I don't think about it

931
01:20:06,912 --> 01:20:09,214
Being myself and make them doubt about it

932
01:20:09,280 --> 01:20:12,925
I won't cry any tears
I'll just live without fear

933
01:20:13,409 --> 01:20:16,889
I'm so happy, 'cause I'm living my life
and I don't think about it

934
01:20:21,474 --> 01:20:24,290
A shooting star

935
01:20:24,418 --> 01:20:27,004
Twinkling across the sky at night

936
01:20:27,843 --> 01:20:30,233
Oh

937
01:20:30,403 --> 01:20:35,226
Near, far
Wishing everything would be all right

938
01:20:36,068 --> 01:20:38,370
Oh

939
01:20:38,724 --> 01:20:42,369
Got my own dreams Got my own plans

940
01:20:42,502 --> 01:20:45,349
Gonna get there anyway I can

941
01:20:45,478 --> 01:20:47,966
'Cause I don't think about it

942
01:20:48,326 --> 01:20:50,115
I don't think about it

943
01:20:50,310 --> 01:20:52,034
I don't think about it

944
01:20:52,199 --> 01:20:54,654
Being myself and make them doubt about it

945
01:20:54,791 --> 01:20:58,621
I won't cry any tears
I'll just live without fear

946
01:20:58,695 --> 01:21:02,525
I'm so happy, 'cause I'm living my life
And I don't think about it

947
01:21:19,210 --> 01:21:23,008
Got my own style Got my own way

948
01:21:24,011 --> 01:21:27,045
I don't care what people say

949
01:21:27,148 --> 01:21:29,963
'Cause I don't think about it

950
01:21:30,028 --> 01:21:32,003
I don't think about it

951
01:21:32,077 --> 01:21:33,670
I don't think about it

952
01:21:33,741 --> 01:21:35,945
Being myself and make them doubt about it

953
01:21:36,045 --> 01:21:39,788
I won't cry any tears
I'll just live without fear

954
01:21:40,269 --> 01:21:44,164
I'm so happy, 'cause I'm living my life
and I don't think about it

955
01:21:44,270 --> 01:21:46,375
I don't think about it

956
01:21:46,446 --> 01:21:48,137
I don't think about it

957
01:21:48,206 --> 01:21:50,149
I don't think about it

958
01:21:50,255 --> 01:21:52,263
Being myself and make them doubt about it

959
01:21:52,336 --> 01:21:56,362
I won't cry any tears
I'll just live without fear

960
01:21:56,432 --> 01:21:59,946
I'm so happy, 'cause I'm living my life
and I don't think about it

961
01:22:01,521 --> 01:22:03,660
Think about it

962
01:22:03,857 --> 01:22:07,241
Think about it, oh

963
01:22:07,474 --> 01:22:09,710
I don't think about it

964
01:22:10,258 --> 01:22:12,430
Oh, yeah

965
01:22:14,259 --> 01:22:17,161
'Cause I'm living my life
and I don't think about it

966
01:22:17,363 --> 01:22:19,785
Yeah, I think there was a bug in the room.
