1
00:01:02,096 --> 00:01:04,329
<i>In the public eye
and in the underworld,</i>

2
00:01:04,331 --> 00:01:07,433
<i>John Gotti has taken on
mythic proportion.</i>

3
00:01:07,435 --> 00:01:10,202
<i>Gotti is kind of
a working class hero.</i>

4
00:01:10,204 --> 00:01:12,337
<i>Gotti, the reputed head</i>

5
00:01:12,339 --> 00:01:15,107
<i>of the nation's largest
mafia family, the Gambinos,</i>

6
00:01:15,109 --> 00:01:17,843
<i>has beaten prosecutors
in the last three cases.</i>

7
00:01:17,845 --> 00:01:20,712
For the government,
this is a must-win case.

8
00:01:20,714 --> 00:01:23,115
They've said it before,
but this time the feds say

9
00:01:23,117 --> 00:01:24,516
they've really got the goods

10
00:01:24,518 --> 00:01:27,119
to lock the
reputed godfather away for life.

11
00:01:27,121 --> 00:01:30,556
I think we can end the
mafia as an institution

12
00:01:30,558 --> 00:01:32,624
in the next three or
four years, five years,

13
00:01:32,626 --> 00:01:36,128
by keeping this kind
of pressure on them.

14
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:40,199
Every day on my
wabc radio program,

15
00:01:40,201 --> 00:01:42,468
I will continue to hammer away

16
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:45,737
at the revisionism
that is the Gotti legacy.

17
00:01:45,739 --> 00:01:49,708
In New York, the Gotti trial is
the hottest show off Broadway.

18
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:50,976
Every day at the courthouse,

19
00:01:50,978 --> 00:01:53,812
the dapper don
plays to a sellout crowd.

20
00:01:53,814 --> 00:01:55,147
It's not just average guys

21
00:01:55,149 --> 00:01:57,216
caught up in
the Gotti spectacle.

22
00:01:57,218 --> 00:02:01,086
A who's who from Hollywood came
to Brooklyn to take in the show.

23
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:03,155
The decision by Sammy
Gravano to testify

24
00:02:03,157 --> 00:02:06,325
is certainly a big, big event.

25
00:02:06,327 --> 00:02:08,827
<i>Gotti's brother Peter
indicated the affections</i>

26
00:02:08,829 --> 00:02:10,729
<i>between the two men have faded.</i>

27
00:02:10,731 --> 00:02:12,664
You ready to see
Sam Gravano today?

28
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:13,665
You ready yet, sir?

29
00:02:20,673 --> 00:02:26,745
Your honor, the state would like
to postpone until tomorrow.

30
00:02:26,747 --> 00:02:28,347
The state's witness,
Sam Gravano,

31
00:02:28,349 --> 00:02:30,582
was unable to appear
due to illness.

32
00:02:30,584 --> 00:02:32,184
Postponed until
tomorrow morning.

33
00:02:32,186 --> 00:02:33,685
Let's not make this a habit.

34
00:02:33,687 --> 00:02:36,688
Also, Mr. Gotti,
if you have any idea

35
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:40,359
who is behind putting
these in car windshields,

36
00:02:40,361 --> 00:02:42,528
kindly ask them to stop.

37
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:58,544
Court is dismissed.

38
00:03:33,012 --> 00:03:36,248
<i>If I want anything done,
I do it myself.</i>

39
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:39,718
<i>Yeah, you always was
a fair guy, Eddie.</i>

40
00:03:42,323 --> 00:03:43,422
<i>Eddie!</i>

41
00:03:43,424 --> 00:03:45,757
<i>Crazy! Eddie.</i>

42
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:46,758
<i>This is one rap you won't beat.</i>

43
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:47,759
<i>Crazy!</i>

44
00:03:50,998 --> 00:03:52,931
<i>You like to laugh, do you?</i>

45
00:03:52,933 --> 00:03:54,833
<i>Well, here, see if
you think this is funny.</i>

46
00:04:00,106 --> 00:04:01,073
<i>Eddie!</i>

47
00:04:05,878 --> 00:04:08,447
<i>Eddie!</i>

48
00:04:10,049 --> 00:04:11,783
<i>Now, who is this guy?</i>

49
00:04:11,785 --> 00:04:14,353
<i>And how are you
hooked up with him?</i>

50
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:19,625
<i>I never figured it out.</i>

51
00:04:19,627 --> 00:04:21,927
<i>What was his business?</i>

52
00:04:24,464 --> 00:04:28,200
Hey, John, how are you?

53
00:04:28,202 --> 00:04:29,401
<i>He used to be a big shot.</i>

54
00:04:43,383 --> 00:04:45,717
I'm ready.

55
00:04:56,664 --> 00:04:57,829
Let's go, man.

56
00:04:57,831 --> 00:04:59,564
Yeah, I see you.

57
00:05:02,603 --> 00:05:06,338
<i>Mierta.</i> You had me waiting
for like 20 minutes, man.

58
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:08,607
John gotti's a hero in queens.

59
00:05:08,609 --> 00:05:12,110
Forget queens, all over new
York, all over the country.

60
00:05:12,112 --> 00:05:15,013
The city denied the club
a fireworks permit

61
00:05:15,015 --> 00:05:16,581
for the first time this year,

62
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:19,184
but that hasn't seemed to stop
the celebrations one bit.

63
00:05:19,186 --> 00:05:21,119
Neighbors say that
mayor Dinkins is doing this

64
00:05:21,121 --> 00:05:25,290
as an attack on ozone park's
favorite citizen, John Gotti.

65
00:05:25,292 --> 00:05:28,527
This is Pablo guzman in queens.

66
00:05:28,529 --> 00:05:30,529
News channel 10, back to you.

67
00:05:32,966 --> 00:05:35,267
Pablo.

68
00:05:35,269 --> 00:05:37,135
Don't write
the history books yet.

69
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:21,980
All right, everybody,
this one's for John!

70
00:06:51,211 --> 00:06:53,111
John!

71
00:07:20,707 --> 00:07:22,641
Could you light this
for me, please?

72
00:07:41,327 --> 00:07:43,462
Give me that.

73
00:07:51,103 --> 00:07:53,338
You're so rude.

74
00:07:56,409 --> 00:07:58,076
Boom.

75
00:08:04,851 --> 00:08:09,120
Who's he? The ice cream man?

76
00:08:09,122 --> 00:08:11,089
Shut up, Ann.

77
00:08:28,641 --> 00:08:30,308
Yeah, you in
the communion suit.

78
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:32,310
You been here all day,
and nobody knows you.

79
00:08:32,312 --> 00:08:34,613
What... what are you
looking for, huh?

80
00:08:34,615 --> 00:08:35,714
Huh?

81
00:08:35,716 --> 00:08:37,449
Where are you from?

82
00:08:37,451 --> 00:08:38,717
I'm from the Bronx.

83
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:41,286
The Bronx? Then what
are you doing here?

84
00:08:41,288 --> 00:08:43,321
I'm celebrating.

85
00:08:43,323 --> 00:08:44,789
You're celebrating? What?
You're celebrating? Yeah.

86
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:46,558
No, no, no, this is
a private block party.

87
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,560
I was invited by junior.

88
00:08:48,562 --> 00:08:52,063
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Are you
saying you're with junior?

89
00:08:52,065 --> 00:08:53,498
Am I stuttering?
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

90
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,734
Are you with junior?
He's with me, Jerry.

91
00:08:55,736 --> 00:08:57,235
He's with me. What do you mean?

92
00:08:57,237 --> 00:08:59,738
Here. You got
a problem with my friend,

93
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:01,740
you go in the hunt club.
You tell him he's with me.

94
00:09:03,576 --> 00:09:05,010
Move it.

95
00:09:05,012 --> 00:09:06,311
Yeah, I'll move it,
I'll move it.

96
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:12,083
So, what, you're just gonna
stare at me all night?

97
00:09:12,085 --> 00:09:13,418
Hmm?

98
00:09:16,656 --> 00:09:18,356
You wanna split this?

99
00:09:18,358 --> 00:09:21,426
You're skinny,
you gotta eat that.

100
00:09:21,428 --> 00:09:24,663
What's your name?

101
00:09:24,665 --> 00:09:29,534
Thomas.

102
00:09:29,536 --> 00:09:32,003
What's yours?

103
00:09:45,952 --> 00:09:48,954
Easy, easy, speed racer.

104
00:09:48,956 --> 00:09:51,122
Not so fast.

105
00:09:51,124 --> 00:09:52,357
Ohh.

106
00:09:52,359 --> 00:09:53,458
You're gonna make me come.

107
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:54,793
I'm gonna come.

108
00:09:54,795 --> 00:09:56,728
Come on, come on, come on.

109
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:59,364
Come on.

110
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,900
Oh, you feel good.

111
00:10:01,902 --> 00:10:03,568
Come on. Ohh!

112
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:04,903
Don't... don't come out.

113
00:10:04,905 --> 00:10:07,706
Stay. Ohh.

114
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:09,574
Ohh...

115
00:10:09,576 --> 00:10:11,476
Yeah, stay like that.

116
00:10:11,478 --> 00:10:13,144
Stay inside.

117
00:10:19,485 --> 00:10:22,220
Kiss me.

118
00:10:22,222 --> 00:10:26,157
You're beautiful.

119
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:28,627
You're fuckin' beautiful.

120
00:10:36,602 --> 00:10:39,604
It's safe. Quiet.

121
00:10:39,606 --> 00:10:40,672
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

122
00:10:40,674 --> 00:10:42,273
Hold on, hold on.

123
00:10:42,275 --> 00:10:45,276
Shh.

124
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:48,613
You feel that?

125
00:10:48,615 --> 00:10:50,015
What?

126
00:10:50,017 --> 00:10:52,250
It's like it vibrates in here.

127
00:10:55,354 --> 00:10:57,022
You Italian?

128
00:10:57,024 --> 00:10:59,190
Half. My mother's side. Here.

129
00:10:59,192 --> 00:11:00,692
My father's Irish.

130
00:11:00,694 --> 00:11:03,261
That's a deadly combination.

131
00:11:05,865 --> 00:11:08,433
Thomas Lucaze.

132
00:11:11,771 --> 00:11:14,973
We called him
three-finger brown.

133
00:11:14,975 --> 00:11:16,975
Could have been
a pro ball player.

134
00:11:16,977 --> 00:11:18,777
A bunch of wiseguys buried him.

135
00:11:18,779 --> 00:11:20,979
Al Capone here, too? No.

136
00:11:20,981 --> 00:11:23,314
Mount Carmel cemetery,
Illinois,

137
00:11:23,316 --> 00:11:24,883
'cause of his years in Chicago.

138
00:11:24,885 --> 00:11:26,551
Do you know he's from Brooklyn?

139
00:11:26,553 --> 00:11:28,219
He got married there, too,

140
00:11:28,221 --> 00:11:31,656
to an Irish woman,
Mae Coughlin.

141
00:11:31,658 --> 00:11:33,224
It's funny,
it's like your family,

142
00:11:33,226 --> 00:11:34,559
but the other way around.

143
00:11:34,561 --> 00:11:37,195
How do you know
all this crazy stuff?

144
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:49,140
Nice.

145
00:11:52,812 --> 00:11:54,746
Why, you wanna know?

146
00:11:54,748 --> 00:11:55,914
No.

147
00:11:55,916 --> 00:11:58,183
It won't come true.

148
00:11:58,185 --> 00:12:00,919
You wanna come home with me?

149
00:12:00,921 --> 00:12:03,521
Yeah.

150
00:12:03,523 --> 00:12:05,190
Stay the night?

151
00:12:05,192 --> 00:12:07,092
Yeah.

152
00:12:12,098 --> 00:12:13,765
Well, there goes your theory.

153
00:12:13,767 --> 00:12:15,266
Yeah? Yeah.

154
00:12:15,268 --> 00:12:16,534
You don't know what
you're in for.

155
00:12:16,536 --> 00:12:18,369
Yeah, I can handle it. Yeah.

156
00:12:18,371 --> 00:12:19,370
Yeah? Yeah.

157
00:12:19,372 --> 00:12:20,839
Come here.

158
00:12:20,841 --> 00:12:23,007
Got me excited now.

159
00:13:17,164 --> 00:13:18,329
Hey.

160
00:13:18,331 --> 00:13:20,665
Oh, shit. Hey.

161
00:13:20,667 --> 00:13:24,169
You scared the shit
out of me. Oh...

162
00:13:26,006 --> 00:13:29,007
I got an appointment
at... oh, okay.

163
00:13:29,009 --> 00:13:32,343
You seen my shoe? Do you
remember where I parked?

164
00:13:32,345 --> 00:13:33,678
No, I didn't want you to go.

165
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,580
I thought that, uh...

166
00:13:35,582 --> 00:13:37,183
That I'd bring us
back in some breakfast.

167
00:13:38,618 --> 00:13:39,918
You got coffee?

168
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,686
Yeah.

169
00:13:41,688 --> 00:13:43,121
No...

170
00:13:43,123 --> 00:13:45,623
That was a lie.
I don't have coffee.

171
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:47,125
But I can go around
the corner and get it.

172
00:13:47,127 --> 00:13:49,427
What is this?

173
00:13:49,429 --> 00:13:50,862
Like I told you last
night, I'm working on

174
00:13:50,864 --> 00:13:53,198
some things that
might help out John sr.

175
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,200
Who's "the twin"?

176
00:13:58,037 --> 00:13:59,871
I can't say right now.

177
00:13:59,873 --> 00:14:02,473
But I got some things
in the works.

178
00:14:02,475 --> 00:14:05,043
"It's my family, Kay.
It's not me."

179
00:14:05,045 --> 00:14:06,811
My name is rose.

180
00:14:06,813 --> 00:14:09,147
"The godfather."

181
00:14:09,149 --> 00:14:10,548
Oh.

182
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:11,549
Michael...

183
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:18,523
Your eyes look like
sunflowers in the light.

184
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:21,626
You know what would be nice?

185
00:14:21,628 --> 00:14:22,894
Why don't you come with me?

186
00:14:22,896 --> 00:14:24,229
What? Come with me.

187
00:14:24,231 --> 00:14:26,130
Where? I gotta go to work.

188
00:14:26,132 --> 00:14:28,967
Call in sick. I can't.

189
00:14:28,969 --> 00:14:31,002
Come on, come with me. I'm telling
you, you're gonna love this.

190
00:14:31,004 --> 00:14:32,971
Can I kiss you?

191
00:14:36,508 --> 00:14:38,576
You better come.

192
00:14:38,578 --> 00:14:40,578
What are we doing?

193
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:42,080
Is he the twin from the photo?

194
00:14:42,082 --> 00:14:44,983
Come on, you'll see.

195
00:14:44,985 --> 00:14:46,584
Watch this, ready?

196
00:14:46,586 --> 00:14:48,086
It's gonna be like
a Swiss watch.

197
00:14:48,088 --> 00:14:52,390
One, two, three.
There's nothing to it.

198
00:14:55,094 --> 00:14:58,429
Come on. Come on, come on.

199
00:14:58,431 --> 00:14:59,864
Oh, excuse us.

200
00:14:59,866 --> 00:15:00,865
Hey. Sorry.

201
00:15:00,867 --> 00:15:02,533
Good morning.

202
00:15:02,535 --> 00:15:03,935
What was that?

203
00:15:03,937 --> 00:15:05,103
Huh? Come on. Who is he?

204
00:15:05,105 --> 00:15:06,938
Is he the guy from the photo?

205
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:08,106
Come on, you'll see
in a moment.

206
00:15:08,108 --> 00:15:09,240
Come on.

207
00:15:11,176 --> 00:15:12,510
What? Wait.

208
00:15:12,512 --> 00:15:13,678
Thomas. Oh, hi, Christine.

209
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,046
How you doing?
How are you? Good.

210
00:15:15,048 --> 00:15:16,614
Be right up there.
You're gonna love this.

211
00:15:16,616 --> 00:15:17,949
You gonna leave me
at the steps?

212
00:15:17,951 --> 00:15:19,183
Come on, it's history
in the making.

213
00:15:19,185 --> 00:15:22,620
Come on. Come on.

214
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:28,293
Thank you, Christine.

215
00:15:28,295 --> 00:15:29,961
She's a great artist.

216
00:15:29,963 --> 00:15:31,763
I got one of her pieces.

217
00:15:33,365 --> 00:15:35,566
This fuckin' place
gives me the creeps.

218
00:15:35,568 --> 00:15:37,201
What are you up to?

219
00:15:37,203 --> 00:15:40,038
You'll get used to it. Come on.
Oh, I hope not.

220
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:43,641
I didn't have good luck last
time I was in a courthouse.

221
00:15:43,643 --> 00:15:46,811
And to quote prosecutor Malone,
"after reviewing

222
00:15:46,813 --> 00:15:49,047
"the tape recordings
from the Ravenite social club,

223
00:15:49,049 --> 00:15:51,149
"it is clear that Mr. cutler
and his associates

224
00:15:51,151 --> 00:15:54,919
are house counsel
to the Gambino crime family."

225
00:15:54,921 --> 00:15:57,221
You see the twin?

226
00:15:59,391 --> 00:16:02,260
Now look at the guy
on the jury.

227
00:16:02,262 --> 00:16:05,663
Second guy in.

228
00:16:05,665 --> 00:16:06,931
You see?

229
00:16:06,933 --> 00:16:08,266
Hmm?

230
00:16:08,268 --> 00:16:10,134
They're brothers.

231
00:16:12,838 --> 00:16:13,838
Look.

232
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:15,974
Look.

233
00:16:17,409 --> 00:16:19,911
They make eyes at each other.

234
00:16:19,913 --> 00:16:21,079
Mm, I'm not sure. Mm.

235
00:16:21,081 --> 00:16:23,614
What? Rose...

236
00:16:23,616 --> 00:16:26,784
It's right under
their fuckin' nose.

237
00:16:26,786 --> 00:16:28,753
Look at him, come on.

238
00:16:28,755 --> 00:16:33,091
I don't see it.

239
00:16:33,093 --> 00:16:36,361
I quote John Gotti
from the tapes.

240
00:16:36,363 --> 00:16:39,864
"Where does it end?
The Gambino crime family?

241
00:16:39,866 --> 00:16:41,432
"This is the cutler, Shargel,

242
00:16:41,434 --> 00:16:43,701
and who-do-you-call-it
crime family."

243
00:16:43,703 --> 00:16:45,770
I'm disqualifying
Mr. cutler and Mr. Shargel

244
00:16:45,772 --> 00:16:47,105
from defending Mr. Gotti...

245
00:16:47,107 --> 00:16:48,539
this is an
obstruction of justice.

246
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:51,376
Those tapes are
attorney-client privilege.

247
00:16:51,378 --> 00:16:53,978
May I remind you that's an
American flag, not a swastika!

248
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:55,980
Yes!

249
00:16:57,484 --> 00:16:59,217
One more reaction like that,
and you will be

250
00:16:59,219 --> 00:17:02,153
removed from this courtroom!

251
00:17:02,155 --> 00:17:03,988
You're basically taking away.

252
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:06,891
Mr. gotti's god-given
right to exist.

253
00:17:06,893 --> 00:17:08,993
I would suggest that you
save the histrionics

254
00:17:08,995 --> 00:17:11,996
for the TV reporters
outside of this courtroom!

255
00:17:11,998 --> 00:17:14,632
Dismissed!

256
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:18,536
Maybe.

257
00:17:20,005 --> 00:17:21,973
Look.

258
00:17:23,175 --> 00:17:25,576
So you get Gotti off.
What then?

259
00:17:25,578 --> 00:17:28,813
We make history. We're in.

260
00:17:28,815 --> 00:17:31,749
"We"? Me and you?

261
00:17:31,751 --> 00:17:34,685
Yeah, me and you.
What do you think?

262
00:17:34,687 --> 00:17:37,188
You're crazy.

263
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:16,127
You can dance!
All the black girls

264
00:18:16,129 --> 00:18:18,563
in high school loved me.
It's my butt.

265
00:18:18,565 --> 00:18:20,798
I got a big old butt,
and I know how to move.

266
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,467
Sure do. You know
what you nearly did?

267
00:18:22,469 --> 00:18:23,801
You wore me out.

268
00:18:23,803 --> 00:18:27,138
Listen, uh, I gotta
get going, all right?

269
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:28,973
No, come on, cous,
let's kill this.

270
00:18:28,975 --> 00:18:30,575
All right. We gotta do a toast.

271
00:18:30,577 --> 00:18:32,310
You know what?

272
00:18:32,312 --> 00:18:35,980
If Gotti got off, that would
be one hell of an ending.

273
00:18:35,982 --> 00:18:37,548
Right?

274
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:39,584
I don't think
that's gonna happen.

275
00:18:39,586 --> 00:18:41,752
Is that a little inside info?

276
00:18:41,754 --> 00:18:44,322
Maybe.

277
00:18:44,324 --> 00:18:46,390
Do you guys still talk?

278
00:18:46,392 --> 00:18:48,326
Oh, you know,
we're not supposed to,

279
00:18:48,328 --> 00:18:49,894
but, uh, I get bits and pieces.

280
00:18:49,896 --> 00:18:52,497
Know what? Why don't you
talk to him?

281
00:18:52,499 --> 00:18:54,765
Maybe he can help us.

282
00:18:54,767 --> 00:18:57,268
Maybe.

283
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:59,003
How much?

284
00:18:59,005 --> 00:19:01,339
50k.

285
00:19:01,341 --> 00:19:04,175
50k, we get "not guilty"?

286
00:19:04,177 --> 00:19:06,077
I'll talk to my brother.

287
00:19:08,747 --> 00:19:10,681
We'll talk to our people.

288
00:19:10,683 --> 00:19:12,683
You know, John Gotti,
he's being persecuted

289
00:19:12,685 --> 00:19:14,252
by the United States
government.

290
00:19:14,254 --> 00:19:16,187
The same government
that stole the land

291
00:19:16,189 --> 00:19:19,257
from the Indians and
enslaved your people.

292
00:19:19,259 --> 00:19:21,092
I'm Jamaican.

293
00:19:21,094 --> 00:19:24,028
Well, you're soon
to be a rich Jamaican.

294
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:25,029
It was nice meeting you.

295
00:19:25,031 --> 00:19:26,130
Nice to meet you, too.

296
00:19:26,132 --> 00:19:27,198
Take care.

297
00:19:29,535 --> 00:19:30,701
I'm right.

298
00:19:30,703 --> 00:19:32,136
Oh, my god.

299
00:19:32,138 --> 00:19:33,137
Am I right?

300
00:19:33,139 --> 00:19:34,972
My god!

301
00:19:34,974 --> 00:19:36,874
You're an angel! Whoo!

302
00:20:02,167 --> 00:20:05,736
It's closing time.

303
00:20:05,738 --> 00:20:07,738
Hey, Timmy,
wanna give these two

304
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:09,407
a few dollars for a motel, man?

305
00:20:09,409 --> 00:20:10,975
What'd you say?

306
00:20:10,977 --> 00:20:13,177
Motel? This is my wife.

307
00:20:13,179 --> 00:20:14,579
Okay.

308
00:20:14,581 --> 00:20:16,247
You apologize to Mrs. Greco.

309
00:20:16,249 --> 00:20:17,648
Come on, Thomas...

310
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:19,917
Nah, no, I want
an apology for Mrs. Greco.

311
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:21,185
This is my wife. Hey, man,
listen to your woman.

312
00:20:21,187 --> 00:20:22,753
Get the fuck out
of here, asshole.

313
00:20:24,323 --> 00:20:26,023
What?

314
00:20:26,025 --> 00:20:27,158
You heard me.

315
00:20:30,429 --> 00:20:32,597
You call him an asshole?
Hey, yo!

316
00:20:34,032 --> 00:20:36,934
My husband's
waiting for an apology.

317
00:20:36,936 --> 00:20:37,935
Okay, I'm sorry.

318
00:20:37,937 --> 00:20:39,270
Is that okay, honey?

319
00:20:39,272 --> 00:20:40,771
He said sorry.

320
00:20:40,773 --> 00:20:42,773
Go, go, go, go. He said s...

321
00:20:42,775 --> 00:20:45,276
go. Slowly.

322
00:20:45,278 --> 00:20:46,344
Go!

323
00:20:59,891 --> 00:21:01,425
Hey!

324
00:21:11,303 --> 00:21:12,603
You okay?

325
00:21:17,242 --> 00:21:20,478
I'm sorry. That was crazy.

326
00:21:22,147 --> 00:21:23,648
Sometimes I do crazy things.

327
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:25,049
I don't know why.

328
00:21:30,155 --> 00:21:31,255
Okay, I get it.

329
00:21:31,257 --> 00:21:32,590
Get out!

330
00:21:32,592 --> 00:21:33,591
Get the fuck out! What?

331
00:21:33,593 --> 00:21:34,992
What? No. Yes!

332
00:21:34,994 --> 00:21:36,427
Get the fuck out!
No, that was incredible.

333
00:21:36,429 --> 00:21:37,828
That was amazing.

334
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:39,497
Rose...

335
00:21:39,499 --> 00:21:40,998
Rose, stop.

336
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,233
Look at me. No.

337
00:21:42,235 --> 00:21:43,668
Look at me, that was amazing.

338
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:45,670
I'm sorry I was quiet.

339
00:21:45,672 --> 00:21:48,406
I'm sorry, I wasn't even...
I wasn't even thinking.

340
00:21:48,408 --> 00:21:50,007
I should have done something.

341
00:21:50,009 --> 00:21:52,576
I think I was just
really embarrassed.

342
00:21:52,578 --> 00:21:55,579
Oh, come close. Shh, shh.

343
00:21:59,284 --> 00:22:00,785
Oh. I'm sorry.

344
00:22:00,787 --> 00:22:02,253
Oh.

345
00:22:02,255 --> 00:22:05,523
Shh, shh.

346
00:22:29,614 --> 00:22:31,382
You coming back?

347
00:22:31,384 --> 00:22:33,451
Course I'm coming back.

348
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:42,460
32, 33, 34, 35, and 40.

349
00:22:42,462 --> 00:22:44,729
Thank you, Donna.

350
00:22:44,731 --> 00:22:45,963
That's for you.

351
00:22:47,899 --> 00:22:49,734
Donna, please tell
Jimmy we miss him a lot

352
00:22:49,736 --> 00:22:51,569
and, uh, you...

353
00:22:51,571 --> 00:22:54,572
If I ever make it to Phoenix,

354
00:22:54,574 --> 00:22:57,007
although I doubt I ever will,
I will get in touch.

355
00:22:57,009 --> 00:22:58,809
Thank you.

356
00:23:03,482 --> 00:23:07,084
Hi. Hey.

357
00:23:07,086 --> 00:23:09,420
The shop looks good.

358
00:23:09,422 --> 00:23:11,489
Same old shit.

359
00:23:11,491 --> 00:23:14,191
You believe this weather?
It's hot, it's cold, it's hot.

360
00:23:14,193 --> 00:23:16,394
Cold again.

361
00:23:20,165 --> 00:23:22,199
Joey bagels?

362
00:23:22,201 --> 00:23:24,201
How'd you guess?

363
00:23:24,203 --> 00:23:26,370
Holy shit.

364
00:23:26,372 --> 00:23:29,106
Yeah. So young.

365
00:23:29,108 --> 00:23:31,375
What happened,
someone punch his ticket?

366
00:23:31,377 --> 00:23:33,043
Yeah, god.

367
00:23:33,045 --> 00:23:34,578
Clogged arteries.

368
00:23:37,449 --> 00:23:40,551
Well, look, ally, I appreciate
you helping with this.

369
00:23:40,553 --> 00:23:42,787
It's just 'til this business
deal goes through, all right?

370
00:23:42,789 --> 00:23:45,289
Um... After you called,

371
00:23:45,291 --> 00:23:48,359
I spoke to Ann
about this, okay?

372
00:23:48,361 --> 00:23:50,628
Ally, they just need
to see I got a job,

373
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:52,530
and then I'll get
out of your hair.

374
00:23:52,532 --> 00:23:54,965
I can't put you
on the books, okay?

375
00:23:54,967 --> 00:23:56,801
Uh, she doesn't think
it's a good idea

376
00:23:56,803 --> 00:23:58,202
to lie to your parole officer.

377
00:23:58,204 --> 00:24:00,204
Hi. Hi.

378
00:24:00,206 --> 00:24:01,238
And I don't either.

379
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,473
All right.

380
00:24:02,475 --> 00:24:03,974
What if they come in here,

381
00:24:03,976 --> 00:24:04,975
they start asking questions,

382
00:24:04,977 --> 00:24:06,143
they start... nobody's...

383
00:24:06,145 --> 00:24:07,745
nobody's gonna
ask any questions.

384
00:24:07,747 --> 00:24:10,414
Well, how do you know
what they're gonna do?

385
00:24:10,416 --> 00:24:11,415
So you're not gonna
help me with this?

386
00:24:11,417 --> 00:24:12,817
No.

387
00:24:12,819 --> 00:24:14,819
Can I help you, ma'am?

388
00:24:14,821 --> 00:24:17,388
I didn't mean to interrupt.

389
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:18,489
This is rose.

390
00:24:18,491 --> 00:24:19,657
She's from queens.

391
00:24:19,659 --> 00:24:20,758
It's my girlfriend.

392
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,493
Oh... okay.

393
00:24:22,495 --> 00:24:24,228
This is my brother Alfonse.

394
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:27,231
Hello.

395
00:24:27,233 --> 00:24:28,399
I just wanted
to see the inside.

396
00:24:28,401 --> 00:24:30,000
It's so cute.

397
00:24:30,002 --> 00:24:31,335
Well... Uh...

398
00:24:31,337 --> 00:24:32,770
we should go.

399
00:24:32,772 --> 00:24:35,439
You know, Thomas
told me a lot about you.

400
00:24:35,441 --> 00:24:37,341
You should come out
and visit our place

401
00:24:37,343 --> 00:24:39,743
with the family
when we're settled in.

402
00:24:39,745 --> 00:24:41,679
I didn't know
you guys were, um...

403
00:24:41,681 --> 00:24:45,683
Yeah, no. We're in
ozone park now, and...

404
00:24:45,685 --> 00:24:48,786
Uh, we were keeping it quiet
for a little bit, but, yeah,

405
00:24:48,788 --> 00:24:51,789
we got a big backyard,
the grass, everything.

406
00:24:51,791 --> 00:24:53,524
You... Ann and the boys
have to come out.

407
00:24:53,526 --> 00:24:55,259
Be nice... get
everybody together.

408
00:24:55,261 --> 00:24:57,194
Sounds good.

409
00:24:57,196 --> 00:24:58,529
Well, it was nice meeting you.

410
00:24:58,531 --> 00:25:00,698
Nice meeting you.
Hey, come here.

411
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:02,466
You know what? Do me a favor.

412
00:25:02,468 --> 00:25:04,134
I wanna show her
out back, all right?

413
00:25:04,136 --> 00:25:05,202
You got the keys?

414
00:25:05,204 --> 00:25:07,371
Okay.

415
00:25:07,373 --> 00:25:11,709
You gotta... you gotta see this.

416
00:25:11,711 --> 00:25:15,713
Thank you. After you.

417
00:25:15,715 --> 00:25:17,314
In the '60s and '70s,

418
00:25:17,316 --> 00:25:19,717
this was the busiest
florist in the Bronx.

419
00:25:19,719 --> 00:25:21,886
Probably the whole city.

420
00:25:21,888 --> 00:25:24,555
Wow.

421
00:25:24,557 --> 00:25:25,823
The Ivy.

422
00:25:25,825 --> 00:25:28,726
I'll get you a job.

423
00:25:28,728 --> 00:25:29,827
Yeah?

424
00:25:29,829 --> 00:25:31,128
Yeah.

425
00:25:32,297 --> 00:25:34,064
<i>You're listening to am 77.</i>

426
00:25:34,066 --> 00:25:35,900
<i>This is
"the Curtis Sliwa show."</i>

427
00:25:35,902 --> 00:25:38,502

on the Gotti trial,</i>

428
00:25:38,504 --> 00:25:41,071

429
00:25:41,073 --> 00:25:43,908
<i>Man should have been put
behind bars a long time ago.</i>

430
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:45,643
Good morning.

431
00:25:45,645 --> 00:25:47,177
Do you hear this?
<i>Sammy "the bull" Gravano...</i>

432
00:25:47,179 --> 00:25:49,914
This guy, gotti's
gonna whack this guy.

433
00:25:49,916 --> 00:25:51,649
There's not even
a question in my mind,

434
00:25:51,651 --> 00:25:53,517
he's gonna get whacked.
Ooh, you're testy.

435
00:25:53,519 --> 00:25:55,185
Why are you listening, hmm?
I don't know.

436
00:25:55,187 --> 00:25:56,587
How's it going? <i>John Gotti...</i>

437
00:25:56,589 --> 00:25:59,089
<i>Is going to spend the...</i>
it's going.

438
00:25:59,091 --> 00:26:00,858
It's going.

439
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:02,426
All these people owe money?

440
00:26:02,428 --> 00:26:05,262
Yeah. That's a lot
of broken thumbs.

441
00:26:05,264 --> 00:26:07,331
These people will be better off
getting their thumbs broken.

442
00:26:07,333 --> 00:26:10,100
Rose! The tile fell.

443
00:26:10,102 --> 00:26:11,769
The water's coming down. What?

444
00:26:11,771 --> 00:26:13,504
What time did the plumber
say he was gonna be here?

445
00:26:13,506 --> 00:26:15,940
He was supposed to be here.
I am gonna break some balls.

446
00:26:15,942 --> 00:26:17,441
He said he tried to call,
and nobody answered the phone.

447
00:26:17,443 --> 00:26:18,676
What?

448
00:26:18,678 --> 00:26:19,777
How's everything working out?

449
00:26:19,779 --> 00:26:20,778
You finding everything okay?

450
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:21,779
Smooth. Good?

451
00:26:21,781 --> 00:26:23,113
Yeah, all right.

452
00:26:23,115 --> 00:26:24,214
Rose, don't tell me
I'm gonna lose you

453
00:26:24,216 --> 00:26:25,382
upstairs now, huh?

454
00:26:25,384 --> 00:26:26,550
Hey, Arthur, I love my job.

455
00:26:26,552 --> 00:26:27,785
Okay, duchess.

456
00:26:27,787 --> 00:26:28,786
I'm taking care of you.

457
00:26:28,788 --> 00:26:30,354
Good day. Okay, duchess.

458
00:26:30,356 --> 00:26:32,022
Duchess of, uh...

459
00:26:32,024 --> 00:26:34,224
That's, uh, that's
Rosie, queen of corona.

460
00:26:34,226 --> 00:26:35,960
Duchess of queen of corona.

461
00:26:35,962 --> 00:26:37,127
That's good.

462
00:26:37,129 --> 00:26:39,129
We got Julio
down by the schoolyard.

463
00:26:39,131 --> 00:26:41,966
I'm happy that I was able
to help you with your parole.

464
00:26:41,968 --> 00:26:43,534
Rose is a good friend.

465
00:26:43,536 --> 00:26:45,302
I know.

466
00:26:45,304 --> 00:26:46,804
I appreciate it.
Well, that's good.

467
00:26:46,806 --> 00:26:48,806
See, that's important
because, you know,

468
00:26:48,808 --> 00:26:51,742
when you reintegrate back
into the real world,

469
00:26:51,744 --> 00:26:54,244
it's important to have
appreciation for what you got.

470
00:26:54,246 --> 00:26:56,580
Right?

471
00:26:56,582 --> 00:26:59,249
Yeah.

472
00:26:59,251 --> 00:27:00,818
Did you get a smock?

473
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:02,219
A what?

474
00:27:02,221 --> 00:27:03,587
Smock. Where's your smock?

475
00:27:03,589 --> 00:27:05,255
Oh, the...

476
00:27:05,257 --> 00:27:06,490
Yeah, where's your smock?

477
00:27:06,492 --> 00:27:08,425
Here. The apron.

478
00:27:08,427 --> 00:27:09,493
It's up here. Good.

479
00:27:09,495 --> 00:27:10,761
Okay, but you gotta wear it.

480
00:27:10,763 --> 00:27:12,229
Oh, wear it now?

481
00:27:12,231 --> 00:27:13,497
Yeah, you gotta
wear it all the time.

482
00:27:13,499 --> 00:27:14,832
You take it off when
you go to lunch.

483
00:27:14,834 --> 00:27:16,500
I thought I was just
doing files, it wasn't...

484
00:27:16,502 --> 00:27:17,835
nah, but when you're
in the warehouse,

485
00:27:17,837 --> 00:27:18,836
you wear the smock.

486
00:27:18,838 --> 00:27:21,739
Okay?

487
00:27:21,741 --> 00:27:23,340
Everybody wears a smock.

488
00:27:23,342 --> 00:27:25,009
Ah, tie it up, tie it up.

489
00:27:25,011 --> 00:27:26,610
You can't walk
around like that.

490
00:27:26,612 --> 00:27:28,412
You gotta tie it up.

491
00:27:28,414 --> 00:27:31,248
Let it do its job for you.

492
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:34,184
You don't wanna get your...
your shirt messed up.

493
00:27:34,186 --> 00:27:35,919
If you need anything, Julio.

494
00:27:35,921 --> 00:27:37,454
Julio. He knows everything.

495
00:27:37,456 --> 00:27:38,622
In the schoolyard.

496
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:40,357
Yeah.

497
00:27:40,359 --> 00:27:41,358
I'll see you later.

498
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,526
Thank you, Arthur.

499
00:27:42,528 --> 00:27:44,495

Okay.

00:29:13,953 --> 00:29:15,085
Wait.

give me mine, all right?

Yeah, yeah, yeah, hold on.

532

Half now, the other half
when John walks.

533
00:29:21,894 --> 00:29:23,727
Half now? Yeah.

534
00:29:23,729 --> 00:29:25,195
No, no, no, not right now.

535
00:29:25,197 --> 00:29:26,296
I'm talking about
after the meeting.

536
00:29:26,298 --> 00:29:27,731
Okay. Hey.

537
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:11,608
Get the fuck out of here.

538
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:13,443
What's the problem?
Take a walk.

539
00:30:13,445 --> 00:30:15,579
You know my father... he don't
want you 100 feet near here.

00:30:15,581 --> 00:30:17,114
Come on, I wanna get a cup of coffee.
No, you're out!

541
00:30:17,116 --> 00:30:18,582
That's it. I'm telling you!
We got it.

542
00:30:18,584 --> 00:30:19,750
Make him get the fuck
outta here!

543
00:30:19,752 --> 00:30:20,918
Come on, let me
get a cup of coffee.

544
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:21,952
He's a fuckin' whack job!

545
00:30:21,954 --> 00:30:23,287
Take him for a walk, please!

546
00:30:23,289 --> 00:30:24,689
Hey, I got it.
Don't worry, go back.

547
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:26,690
Motherfucker.

548
00:30:26,692 --> 00:30:28,592
What's the problem? Come
on, let's go for a walk.

549
00:30:28,594 --> 00:30:30,627
All right, all right, I get
it, I get it... no worries.

550
00:30:30,629 --> 00:30:32,462
Get outta here!
All right, I got it.

551
00:30:32,464 --> 00:30:34,598
Don't worry about it.
It's all good.

552
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,266
What are you doing?
I'm not the one who...

553
00:30:36,268 --> 00:30:37,301
you know you're not supposed
to be around the clubs.

554
00:30:37,303 --> 00:30:38,869
You know that.

555
00:30:38,871 --> 00:30:40,370
Come on, I'm back now,
Mickey, all right?

556
00:30:40,372 --> 00:30:41,471
I didn't name names.

557
00:30:41,473 --> 00:30:42,472
I did the right thing.

558
00:30:42,474 --> 00:30:43,941
What names?

559
00:30:43,943 --> 00:30:45,375
No one told you to
go rob the blockbuster.

560
00:30:45,377 --> 00:30:46,643
You were on your own.

561
00:30:46,645 --> 00:30:47,978
Come on, I was
just trying to be

562
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:49,379
a good soldier for
big sal and ern.

563
00:30:49,381 --> 00:30:50,480
Hey, Thomas...

564
00:30:50,482 --> 00:30:52,282
You're not with us, okay?

565
00:30:52,284 --> 00:30:53,884
You freak out big sal.

566
00:30:53,886 --> 00:30:55,652
You need to cool it down,
or you're gonna get hurt.

567
00:30:55,654 --> 00:30:57,221
All right, do me
a favor, all right?

568
00:30:57,223 --> 00:30:59,556
You talk to big sal,
you tell him I understand

569
00:30:59,558 --> 00:31:00,824
there's a little bit of
heat on me right now,

570
00:31:00,826 --> 00:31:02,125
and it doesn't look good.

571
00:31:02,127 --> 00:31:04,461
Okay? But I'm right
and I'm loyal.

572
00:31:04,463 --> 00:31:06,230
Ah, you gotta stop
talking like that.

573
00:31:06,232 --> 00:31:08,165
You're a fuckin' florist.

574
00:31:08,167 --> 00:31:10,667
Now go help Alfonse
and cut this shit out.

575
00:31:10,669 --> 00:31:13,070
Come on, Mickey,
I got something big.

576
00:31:13,072 --> 00:31:14,738
Mickey, I got a fuckin' jury.

577
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:16,406
I don't wanna fuck... i
don't wanna hear about it.

578
00:31:16,408 --> 00:31:17,975
What do you mean,
you don't wanna hear?

579
00:31:17,977 --> 00:31:19,343
I got a fuckin' juror
on the Gotti trial.

580
00:31:19,345 --> 00:31:20,644
I got his twin brother.

581
00:31:20,646 --> 00:31:23,347
I need to talk to John.

582
00:31:23,349 --> 00:31:26,250
You are crazy.

583
00:31:26,252 --> 00:31:28,085
No, 'cause John ain't gonna
sit down with you on this.

584
00:31:28,087 --> 00:31:29,486
He's not gonna sit down?

585
00:31:29,488 --> 00:31:31,688
Well, then he doesn't
get the juror.

586
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:33,490
You fucking with me?

587
00:31:33,492 --> 00:31:35,192
I swear to god,
may he strike me dead.

588
00:31:35,194 --> 00:31:37,261
On my life. I'm dead serious.

589
00:31:37,263 --> 00:31:39,096
Look, they ain't selling you
no junk, you understand?

590
00:31:39,098 --> 00:31:40,264
You think this is about junk?
I'm fuckin' clean.

591
00:31:40,266 --> 00:31:41,765
Why don't you fuckin' tell me?

592
00:31:41,767 --> 00:31:44,668
Mickey, I'm clean,
I'm telling you.

593
00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:45,669
All right, I'll see
what I can do.

594
00:31:45,671 --> 00:31:47,004
Yeah? Yeah.

595
00:31:47,006 --> 00:31:48,105
All right, then I
get to meet John?

596
00:31:48,107 --> 00:31:49,940
Yeah. Let me
figure everything out.

597
00:31:49,942 --> 00:31:53,110
I'll call you.
Go home. Good-bye.

598
00:31:55,947 --> 00:31:57,447
Cacciatore is nice, mom.

599
00:31:57,449 --> 00:31:59,283
I made it because you like it.

600
00:32:00,452 --> 00:32:02,119
Anthony, you want some more?

601
00:32:02,121 --> 00:32:03,687
No, mom, I'm full.

602
00:32:03,689 --> 00:32:06,356
I can't eat anymore.

603
00:32:10,728 --> 00:32:13,563
Mr. Avello making you a
good deal on the apartment?

604
00:32:13,565 --> 00:32:17,234
Yeah. Mm, it's okay.

605
00:32:17,236 --> 00:32:18,635
I mean, it's a little moldy.

606
00:32:18,637 --> 00:32:20,203
We're fixing it up
as we go along.

607
00:32:20,205 --> 00:32:21,905
That takes time. Ma, you
should come see it.

608
00:32:21,907 --> 00:32:24,074
Come meet Thomas.
You'll like him.

609
00:32:24,076 --> 00:32:27,110
It'll be nice. What?

610
00:32:30,381 --> 00:32:33,550
Uh, yeah. Uh, maybe.

611
00:32:33,552 --> 00:32:34,818
Ma, what are you
looking at him for?

612
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:36,153
It's my house.

613
00:32:36,155 --> 00:32:38,055
She doesn't wanna meet him.

614
00:32:38,057 --> 00:32:40,157
She knows all she needs
to know about him.

615
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:42,326
How? Huh? How do you think?

616
00:32:42,328 --> 00:32:43,727
Did you run my name

617
00:32:43,729 --> 00:32:45,495
at that little computer
of yours at work lately?

618
00:32:45,497 --> 00:32:47,931
It's not a pretty picture,
either!

619
00:32:47,933 --> 00:32:49,933
What are you doing?
Rose, rose, sit down.

620
00:32:49,935 --> 00:32:52,736
Rose, please, sit...
you didn't finish your...

621
00:32:52,738 --> 00:32:54,171
he's a kid, rose. He's a kid.

622
00:32:54,173 --> 00:32:55,405
Oh, get a life, Anthony!

623
00:32:55,407 --> 00:32:56,506
Rose, don't start, please.

624
00:32:56,508 --> 00:32:58,508
Ma... I love you.

625
00:32:58,510 --> 00:32:59,910
Do you wanna meet my boyfriend?
Sit and finish.

626
00:32:59,912 --> 00:33:02,512
See my place?
I'll come pick you up.

627
00:33:02,514 --> 00:33:03,847
Mind your own business,
Anthony!

628
00:33:03,849 --> 00:33:07,184
You are my business!
Rose, sit down.

629
00:33:07,186 --> 00:33:09,353
Daddy is rolling over in his
grave 'cause of what you did.

630
00:33:09,355 --> 00:33:12,689
What I did?! What I did?

631
00:33:12,691 --> 00:33:14,958
Hey... Hey...

632
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:15,959
what?

633
00:33:15,961 --> 00:33:17,194
You using again?

634
00:33:17,196 --> 00:33:18,929
Ma, he's got his hand on me!

635
00:33:18,931 --> 00:33:20,864
I got a job, I got a
boyfriend, I got an apartment.

636
00:33:20,866 --> 00:33:22,032
You're using again.

637
00:33:22,034 --> 00:33:23,200
Do I look like I'm using again?

638
00:33:23,202 --> 00:33:25,102
I know it! I know you.

639
00:33:25,104 --> 00:33:26,703
Get your hand out of my face!

640
00:33:26,705 --> 00:33:28,972
And I know him!

641
00:33:54,566 --> 00:33:57,067
I don't want any trouble.

642
00:33:57,069 --> 00:33:58,969
Well...

643
00:33:58,971 --> 00:34:00,670
You can have my coffee.

644
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:09,312
You lost your way?

645
00:34:09,314 --> 00:34:12,015
I think I may have something
that interests you.

646
00:34:14,086 --> 00:34:17,821
We've always known that, rose.

647
00:34:17,823 --> 00:34:21,258
It's not like that.

648
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:24,361
I have a boyfriend now. Ah.

649
00:34:24,363 --> 00:34:25,862
Congratulations.

650
00:34:27,366 --> 00:34:29,199
It's about your friend.

651
00:34:35,107 --> 00:34:36,106
Let's go outside.
Let's go talk.

652
00:34:36,108 --> 00:34:37,340
Not in here.

653
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:52,389
Come on, huh?

654
00:34:52,391 --> 00:34:54,624
Mmm!

655
00:34:54,626 --> 00:34:57,060
So how do you know
this Richie guy?

656
00:34:57,062 --> 00:34:58,695
Hey, hey, hey, you know what?

657
00:34:58,697 --> 00:35:01,731
You know what?
I don't even care.

658
00:35:01,733 --> 00:35:04,301
You're the real deal.

659
00:35:07,638 --> 00:35:10,207
There he is.

660
00:35:10,209 --> 00:35:13,977
My favorite twin.
Cous. Come here.

661
00:35:13,979 --> 00:35:15,412
Hey, do me a favor, huh?

662
00:35:15,414 --> 00:35:16,546
We gotta talk a little
business over here.

663
00:35:16,548 --> 00:35:17,914
Maybe...

664
00:35:17,916 --> 00:35:19,316
Hey. Hi.

665
00:35:19,318 --> 00:35:20,417
So what's the word?

666
00:35:20,419 --> 00:35:21,651
Yeah, my brother's ready.

667
00:35:21,653 --> 00:35:22,653
What? My brother's ready.

668
00:35:22,654 --> 00:35:23,653
Your brother's ready?

669
00:35:23,655 --> 00:35:24,821
He's ready, so, you know,

670
00:35:24,823 --> 00:35:26,156
when I get mine, it's all set.

671
00:35:26,158 --> 00:35:27,824
We're all set?
You know, but we gotta

672
00:35:27,826 --> 00:35:29,493
wrap it up because, you know...

673
00:35:29,495 --> 00:35:31,094
Gotta move, 'cause the trial
is gonna wrap up and...

674
00:35:31,096 --> 00:35:32,662
no, no, you don't understand.

675
00:35:32,664 --> 00:35:34,598
We don't gotta move
no more, you know why?

676
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,933
We got the clearance
from the tippy top.

677
00:35:36,935 --> 00:35:38,568
We're all good, cous.

678
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:41,338
That's gonna come in
handy, I tell you.

679
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:42,839
Hey, well,
that's your business.

680
00:35:42,841 --> 00:35:44,608
Yeah, now let me tell you
something. Tomorrow,

681
00:35:44,610 --> 00:35:46,943
we're gonna call you
in the morning, okay?

682
00:35:46,945 --> 00:35:48,678
All right.
And we're gonna tell you

683
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:50,013
where we're gonna meet, all right?
Okay.

684
00:35:50,015 --> 00:35:51,781
How do I say it
in Jamaican? Tomorrow.

685
00:35:51,783 --> 00:35:53,083
I'll see you tomorrow.
All right, hey,

686
00:35:53,085 --> 00:35:54,518
why don't you stay for a drink?

687
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:55,585
You want a drink?
No, no, that's all right.

688
00:35:55,587 --> 00:35:56,686
Nah? No.

689
00:35:56,688 --> 00:35:57,687
All right. All right.

690
00:35:57,689 --> 00:35:59,689
Not my kind of place.

691
00:35:59,691 --> 00:36:01,358
Oh! What's that mean?

692
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:03,293
It's not your kind of place.
I don't know, it was...

693
00:36:03,295 --> 00:36:05,362
This is not my kind
of place, "mahn."

694
00:36:05,364 --> 00:36:06,429
Mmm!

695
00:36:06,431 --> 00:36:08,198
This my kind of place.

696
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:10,600
You... oh, shit. Don't look.

697
00:36:10,602 --> 00:36:12,602
Don't look behind me.
It's Paulie.

698
00:36:12,604 --> 00:36:14,204
It's Paulie all right, I'm
gonna look over this way.

699
00:36:14,206 --> 00:36:15,772
From the fuckin'
"pope of greenwich village."

700
00:36:15,774 --> 00:36:19,776
Look!
It's fuckin' Eric Roberts.

701
00:36:19,778 --> 00:36:22,779
Holy shit.

702
00:36:26,551 --> 00:36:28,385
He's fuckin'
standin' right there.

703
00:36:28,387 --> 00:36:29,386
Maybe should we
buy him a drink?

704
00:36:29,388 --> 00:36:30,620
Yeah. Come on.

705
00:36:30,622 --> 00:36:33,390
Paulie...

706
00:36:33,392 --> 00:36:34,724
To the end of the bed bug.

707
00:36:37,128 --> 00:36:39,162
Yeah, that's good.

708
00:36:39,164 --> 00:36:40,897
Holy shit.

709
00:36:42,734 --> 00:36:46,002
Disco, Paulie.

710
00:36:46,004 --> 00:36:49,005
Paulie, anything you need,
you talk to me, all right?

711
00:36:49,007 --> 00:36:52,842
Eric. You gotta start
calling me Eric, man.

712
00:36:52,844 --> 00:36:55,979
You know, it was nice to see
Charlie at John's trial.

713
00:36:55,981 --> 00:36:58,148
It was good to see him
show support.

714
00:36:58,150 --> 00:36:59,182
It was solid.

715
00:36:59,184 --> 00:37:00,417
Charlie?

716
00:37:00,419 --> 00:37:02,485
You mean Mickey, Mickey Rourke.

717
00:37:02,487 --> 00:37:03,587
You heard it here.

718
00:37:03,589 --> 00:37:05,422
Uncle John walks.

719
00:37:05,424 --> 00:37:07,257
Mark my words.

720
00:37:07,259 --> 00:37:09,326
Hey, you need anything,
name's Thomas, all right?

721
00:37:09,328 --> 00:37:11,761
Thanks, Thomas, I really
appreciate the cocaine

722
00:37:11,763 --> 00:37:13,863
and the conversation. Um...

723
00:37:13,865 --> 00:37:17,334
Hey, you know, I was glad you
poisoned the bed bug's Espresso.

724
00:37:17,336 --> 00:37:19,102
Um... You should
have never ratted

725
00:37:19,104 --> 00:37:20,870
on your buddy Charlie,
but you know what?

726
00:37:20,872 --> 00:37:22,772
You came through in the end.

727
00:37:22,774 --> 00:37:25,275
Well, uh...
oh, the movie, right?

728
00:37:25,277 --> 00:37:27,444
Uh... I'm glad you liked it.

729
00:37:27,446 --> 00:37:29,346
Thanks, brother.

730
00:37:36,721 --> 00:37:37,954
His nose is like
a fuckin' vacuum.

731
00:37:37,956 --> 00:37:39,055
Really?

732
00:37:39,057 --> 00:37:40,357
It was just, oh, forget it,

733
00:37:40,359 --> 00:37:41,791
he was snorting everything up.

734
00:37:41,793 --> 00:37:43,226
You kidding me?

735
00:37:43,228 --> 00:37:45,729
Ooh, I wanna go to Hawaii.

736
00:37:45,731 --> 00:37:47,397
Are you kidding me?

737
00:37:47,399 --> 00:37:49,065
You know how many
fuckin' big shots

738
00:37:49,067 --> 00:37:50,367
are in here?

739
00:37:50,369 --> 00:37:51,568
They're called
Hawaiian moonlighters.

740
00:37:51,570 --> 00:37:52,902
They're in there,
playing cards,

741
00:37:52,904 --> 00:37:56,239
probably 30,
40 grand on the table.

742
00:37:56,241 --> 00:38:00,644
You wanna moonlight
in Hawaii with me?

743
00:38:00,646 --> 00:38:02,646
Let me take you to Hawaii.

744
00:38:05,816 --> 00:38:09,386
Tomorrow, we're gonna be able
to walk into that place...

745
00:38:09,388 --> 00:38:13,590
We're gonna lay down 30 grand
of our own money on the table.

746
00:38:13,592 --> 00:38:16,393
Like a king and a queen.
You know that?

747
00:38:16,395 --> 00:38:19,896
What's the matter
with you? Hmm?

748
00:38:25,336 --> 00:38:26,836
Promise me something.

749
00:38:26,838 --> 00:38:29,939
What?

750
00:38:29,941 --> 00:38:31,675
Promise you what?

751
00:38:31,677 --> 00:38:34,678
That I'm never
going back to jail.

752
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:37,013
Rose, I promise you.

753
00:38:37,015 --> 00:38:39,683
You better fuckin'
be for real, Thomas.

754
00:38:39,685 --> 00:38:41,351
Rose...

755
00:38:41,353 --> 00:38:43,286
Come here, give me your hand.

756
00:38:43,288 --> 00:38:46,923
I promise. All right?

757
00:38:46,925 --> 00:38:50,527
Come on.

758
00:38:50,529 --> 00:38:52,128
We got a big day tomorrow.

759
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:55,031
Come on. Let's go home.

760
00:39:06,544 --> 00:39:08,645
Uh...

761
00:39:08,647 --> 00:39:10,146
I look all right?

762
00:39:10,148 --> 00:39:11,948
Yeah.

763
00:39:17,988 --> 00:39:20,957
He said he'd meet us outside.

764
00:39:30,234 --> 00:39:31,901
Or should I, uh...

765
00:39:31,903 --> 00:39:33,336
Maybe I'll just go inside?

766
00:39:33,338 --> 00:39:35,572
What are you doing? No?

767
00:39:35,574 --> 00:39:37,140
Oh!

768
00:39:38,809 --> 00:39:41,478
Richie, this is Thomas.

769
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:44,681
This is rose.

770
00:39:44,683 --> 00:39:47,150
Yeah, I know rose.

771
00:39:47,152 --> 00:39:48,685
I don't wanna talk in here.

772
00:39:48,687 --> 00:39:49,986
Come.

773
00:39:51,322 --> 00:39:52,422
I thought... we're not gonna...

774
00:39:52,424 --> 00:39:54,023
nah, it's okay.

775
00:39:54,025 --> 00:39:56,926
Talk down there, you talk to
him by yourself, you know?

776
00:39:56,928 --> 00:39:58,261
Okay.

777
00:39:58,263 --> 00:40:00,864
I thought the twin
was coming with you.

778
00:40:00,866 --> 00:40:02,165
Well, yeah, no, no.

779
00:40:02,167 --> 00:40:03,666
He was supposed to
meet us outside,

780
00:40:03,668 --> 00:40:05,769
and then I figured
I was gonna check inside.

781
00:40:05,771 --> 00:40:07,937
'Cause, you know,
if you're not on the inside,

782
00:40:07,939 --> 00:40:09,239
you're on the outside, right?

783
00:40:11,108 --> 00:40:14,110
When do I get to meet John?

784
00:40:14,112 --> 00:40:15,578
He's not coming, Thomas.

785
00:40:17,114 --> 00:40:20,216
No, no, I know he's not, um...

786
00:40:20,218 --> 00:40:22,852
I know he's not gonna be here
right now, but I'm saying...

787
00:40:22,854 --> 00:40:25,955
not Gotti. I meant your twin.

788
00:40:25,957 --> 00:40:27,957
I don't wanna
see you around here.

789
00:40:27,959 --> 00:40:31,961
You understand?

790
00:40:31,963 --> 00:40:35,064
I, um... no, no,
he's supposed to be here.

791
00:40:35,066 --> 00:40:38,134
I think there's a mix-up, because
he was supposed to meet us outside,

792
00:40:38,136 --> 00:40:40,804
but I think maybe he got scared.
See, he's a black guy.

793
00:40:40,806 --> 00:40:42,639
Mickey, I thi... he's a black guy.
Did I tell you that?

794
00:40:42,641 --> 00:40:45,141
You're being a fucking
wiseass, huh? No.

795
00:40:45,143 --> 00:40:47,210
Hey! You... hey!

796
00:40:49,147 --> 00:40:52,816
You know what it's like to get
slapped in the mouth, rose?

797
00:40:52,818 --> 00:40:55,585
There you go.

798
00:40:55,587 --> 00:40:58,221
What, are you fucking them
out of the cradle now?

799
00:40:58,223 --> 00:40:59,656
You know better.

800
00:41:00,658 --> 00:41:02,725
I ran into your twin.

801
00:41:02,727 --> 00:41:04,227
What'd you think,
I was gonna set this up

802
00:41:04,229 --> 00:41:06,062
without looking out first?

803
00:41:06,064 --> 00:41:08,097
First of all, twin?

804
00:41:08,099 --> 00:41:09,566
Are you kidding me?

805
00:41:09,568 --> 00:41:13,837
He don't even know him.
He played you.

806
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:16,239
He's just a fuckin' fan
watching the trial.

807
00:41:16,241 --> 00:41:17,340
Smarten up.

808
00:41:21,278 --> 00:41:23,680
You okay?

809
00:41:53,644 --> 00:41:56,613
Hey, man, yeah, they
closed the doors early.

810
00:41:56,615 --> 00:41:58,615
It's totally full.

811
00:42:01,151 --> 00:42:03,620
<i>This is
"the Curtis Sliwa show."</i>

812
00:42:03,622 --> 00:42:06,623
<i>The jury is out
in the John Gotti trial.</i>

813
00:42:06,625 --> 00:42:08,725
<i>My friends, trust me.</i>

814
00:42:08,727 --> 00:42:11,027
<i>They won't be out
for long, mark my wor...</i>

815
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:15,565
Rose, I'm sorry,
but he's fired.

816
00:42:15,567 --> 00:42:18,234
This is his check for
whatever he supposedly did.

817
00:42:18,236 --> 00:42:21,137
Arthur... There's a mistake.

818
00:42:21,139 --> 00:42:22,639
I'm sure there's
an explanation.

819
00:42:22,641 --> 00:42:26,075
No, rose, you know what?
You are making the mistake.

820
00:42:26,077 --> 00:42:28,177
You are making a big mistake.

821
00:42:28,179 --> 00:42:31,347
What's that supposed to mean?

822
00:42:31,349 --> 00:42:33,249
You could do better.

823
00:42:33,251 --> 00:42:35,652
Like you, Arthur? Is that it, huh?
No, not necessarily.

824
00:42:35,654 --> 00:42:37,487
No, you wanna fuck me,
I know it.

825
00:42:37,489 --> 00:42:39,355
You know what? I wouldn't
fuck you with Julio's dick

826
00:42:39,357 --> 00:42:41,257
and blame it on Marie
in accounting.

827
00:42:41,259 --> 00:42:43,526
So draft out my fuckin'
check while you're at it.

828
00:42:43,528 --> 00:42:45,228
Thank you for the opportunity.

829
00:42:46,697 --> 00:42:48,264
Fuck yourself.

830
00:42:48,266 --> 00:42:50,667
Fuckin' hell hole!

00:43:22,567 --> 00:43:24,801

The don is covered with velcro

00:43:50,895 --> 00:43:53,396

<i>Certainly here in New York...</i>

down a police captain?

00:47:11,362 --> 00:47:12,762
You think I got

891
00:47:12,764 --> 00:47:15,364
Here!
Put this in the fuckin' bag!

892
00:47:15,366 --> 00:47:16,599
Now give me...
give me his watch.

893
00:47:16,601 --> 00:47:18,367
What does he want?
He wants your watch!

894
00:47:18,369 --> 00:47:20,369
My what?
Forget the fuckin' watch!

895
00:47:20,371 --> 00:47:21,370
I don't care about the watch.

896
00:47:21,372 --> 00:47:22,805
Hurry up, go.

897
00:47:22,807 --> 00:47:24,373
I want everything else.

898
00:47:24,375 --> 00:47:25,708
Go ahead, go, put it in.

899
00:47:25,710 --> 00:47:27,476
Hey, what are you
saying over there?

900
00:47:27,478 --> 00:47:29,212
Huh? What are you saying?

901
00:47:29,214 --> 00:47:31,113
Turn around. Turn around.

902
00:47:31,115 --> 00:47:35,051
Don't make eyes at him.
You, what are you doing?

903
00:47:35,053 --> 00:47:37,286
Give me the fuckin' bag.
Piece of shit.

904
00:47:37,288 --> 00:47:39,121
All right, the bag broke,
what do you want me to do?

905
00:47:39,123 --> 00:47:41,224
Better watch your ass.

906
00:47:41,226 --> 00:47:42,725
Aah!

907
00:47:42,727 --> 00:47:45,628
Stop fuckin' lookin' at me!

908
00:47:48,832 --> 00:47:51,067
Get in the car! Come on!

909
00:47:51,069 --> 00:47:54,003
Get in!
- Get in.

910
00:48:00,244 --> 00:48:01,244
Whew.

911
00:48:01,246 --> 00:48:04,680
Oh, fuck.

912
00:48:04,682 --> 00:48:07,083
Ohh.

913
00:48:07,085 --> 00:48:08,084
Oh.

914
00:48:08,086 --> 00:48:09,652
Ohh.

915
00:48:09,654 --> 00:48:11,687
I pissed myself.

916
00:48:11,689 --> 00:48:15,258
Well...

917
00:48:15,260 --> 00:48:17,860
Ah, it fuckin' happens.

918
00:48:17,862 --> 00:48:20,429
It happens, honey. Pssh.

919
00:48:20,431 --> 00:48:21,430
Fuckin'...

920
00:48:21,432 --> 00:48:23,599
Hey, you're amazing.

921
00:48:23,601 --> 00:48:25,768
Okay? You're fuckin' amazing.

922
00:48:25,770 --> 00:48:27,203
You did it. You fuckin' did it.

923
00:48:27,205 --> 00:48:29,772
You fuckin' did it!

924
00:48:40,184 --> 00:48:42,118
There it is. You ready?

925
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:43,786
I think this is real.

926
00:48:46,624 --> 00:48:48,391
They look like
solid gold heels.

927
00:48:49,527 --> 00:48:51,227
Oh, look, we got laserdisc.

928
00:48:51,229 --> 00:48:54,297
This machine plays
movies like a record.

929
00:48:54,299 --> 00:48:56,866
Okay, it's like a record
but it's a movie.

930
00:48:56,868 --> 00:48:58,467
Look at that, rose.

931
00:48:58,469 --> 00:49:02,638
And a rope like that
with the Christ.

932
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:04,473
Christmas came early.

933
00:49:07,045 --> 00:49:08,811
A new TV.

934
00:49:08,813 --> 00:49:10,079
No, no, no, wait.

935
00:49:11,649 --> 00:49:13,049
Hold up, we wanna try this out,

00:49:13,051 --> 00:49:15,818
and we wanna

937
00:49:15,820 --> 00:49:17,720
Ma, uh, no, but this phone,

938
00:49:17,722 --> 00:49:19,755
I can't... it's not
hooked into the wall.

939
00:49:19,757 --> 00:49:21,324
I can just go anywhere.

940
00:49:21,326 --> 00:49:23,559
I could call you...
i could be on the bus,

941
00:49:23,561 --> 00:49:25,261
I could be walking
down the street,

942
00:49:25,263 --> 00:49:26,929
I could...
you could go to church,

943
00:49:26,931 --> 00:49:29,732
you could call me
from inside church.

944
00:49:29,734 --> 00:49:33,336
Ahh, some of it
just dropped... fuck.

945
00:49:33,338 --> 00:49:35,237
You ought to try smokin' it.

946
00:49:36,273 --> 00:49:38,140
You sure?

947
00:49:39,509 --> 00:49:41,577
Yeah.

948
00:49:43,013 --> 00:49:45,181

00:49:48,353 --> 00:49:50,419
You wanna try it?
You wanna come with me?

951
00:49:53,790 --> 00:49:57,259
It's gonna fuckin' launch you.

952
00:49:57,261 --> 00:49:59,862
It's gonna fuckin'
launch you up there.

953
00:49:59,864 --> 00:50:01,931
You understand?

954
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:05,935
Ooh, I don't know.

955
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:10,706
Hold it up. Be careful. Okay.

00:50:10,708 --> 00:50:12,375

00:50:12,377 --> 00:50:13,609

00:50:15,145 --> 00:50:16,812
Pull it, pull it.

959
00:50:16,814 --> 00:50:18,881
Pull it right the fuck down.

960
00:50:18,883 --> 00:50:20,049
Pull it.

961
00:50:20,051 --> 00:50:22,118
Smoke the fuckin' shit

962
00:50:25,489 --> 00:50:27,056
Holy shit!

00:50:32,830 --> 00:50:35,131
Ohh... oh. Yeah.

00:50:35,133 --> 00:50:37,466
So what's...

968
00:50:37,468 --> 00:50:39,168
What's with the getups?

969
00:50:39,170 --> 00:50:41,237
Tell me the story.

970
00:50:43,907 --> 00:50:48,411
December 16, 1985,
sparks steakhouse.

971
00:50:48,413 --> 00:50:49,812
6:00 P.M.

972
00:50:51,915 --> 00:50:54,850
Hmm? There were four
designated shooters.

973
00:50:54,852 --> 00:50:56,685
Vincent Atuso, John Carneglia,

974
00:50:56,687 --> 00:50:59,021

00:50:59,023 --> 00:51:01,490
Pull it. Pull it.

976
00:51:01,492 --> 00:51:04,427
Deep. Take it deep.

977
00:51:04,429 --> 00:51:07,430
Holy shit.

978
00:51:08,598 --> 00:51:10,433
They wore white trench coats

979
00:51:10,435 --> 00:51:12,268
and cossack hats.

980
00:51:12,270 --> 00:51:13,536
Ohh.

981
00:51:13,538 --> 00:51:15,337
Oh...

982
00:51:15,339 --> 00:51:16,705
Gotti knew they'd
pay more attention

983
00:51:16,707 --> 00:51:19,775
to the outfits
than the shooters.

984
00:51:19,777 --> 00:51:21,544
The fuckin' man was brilliant.

985
00:51:29,219 --> 00:51:31,520
Who's he? Paul Castellano,

986
00:51:31,522 --> 00:51:34,023
a. K.A. The Howard Hughes
of the mob.

987
00:51:37,127 --> 00:51:39,195
Never left his mansion.

988
00:51:39,197 --> 00:51:41,697
That's scary.

989
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:44,767
Never even saw it coming.

990
00:51:53,577 --> 00:51:54,977
Bang.

991
00:52:10,393 --> 00:52:13,162
<i>Take over an empire
of dirty money</i>

992
00:52:13,164 --> 00:52:14,830
<i>and power built on drugs,</i>

993
00:52:14,832 --> 00:52:17,166
<i>flesh-peddling, violence,
and intimidation.</i>

994
00:52:17,168 --> 00:52:18,834
<i>As he stepped from
his black Lincoln,</i>

995
00:52:18,836 --> 00:52:20,736
<i>three men wearing
fur hats and trench coats</i>

996
00:52:20,738 --> 00:52:23,272
<i>pumped six bullets into
"big Paul" Castellano,</i>

997
00:52:23,274 --> 00:52:26,175
<i>the man considered boss of
all mob bosses in the country,</i>

998
00:52:26,177 --> 00:52:27,743
<i>and then calmly walked away.</i>

999
00:52:28,912 --> 00:52:30,679
Excuse me! Hi, dreamboat.

1000
00:52:30,681 --> 00:52:32,248
Can you help me out here?
I'm lost.

1001
00:52:32,250 --> 00:52:33,682
Oh... back.

1002
00:52:33,684 --> 00:52:35,184
Come on, get in!

1003
00:52:35,186 --> 00:52:36,685
Get in, get in!

1004
00:52:36,687 --> 00:52:39,255
Fuck. Get in.

1005
00:52:39,257 --> 00:52:41,190
Get in. Hey!

1006
00:52:41,192 --> 00:52:43,359
Turn around. Turn around!

00:52:43,361 --> 00:52:45,694
He's fuckin' following us!

1008
00:52:45,696 --> 00:52:48,297
Nobody's following us.

1009
00:52:48,299 --> 00:52:49,932
Put all the fuckin'
money in the bag!

1010
00:52:51,134 --> 00:52:53,035
Come on!

1011
00:52:53,037 --> 00:52:54,603
All right, hands up!

1012
00:52:54,605 --> 00:52:56,639
Put all the fuckin'
money in the bag.

1013
00:52:56,641 --> 00:52:58,474
Come on, this watch.

1014
00:52:58,476 --> 00:53:00,442
Get in the car!

1015
00:53:00,444 --> 00:53:02,778
We got everything. Ha!

1016
00:53:04,214 --> 00:53:06,215
Put your fuckin' hands up.

1017
00:53:06,217 --> 00:53:08,717
This is for you.

1018
00:53:08,719 --> 00:53:11,120
This is heavy.

1019
00:53:15,559 --> 00:53:17,626
Back the fuck up!

1020
00:53:17,628 --> 00:53:19,495
Come on, I'm gonna make
an example out of you!

1021
00:53:19,497 --> 00:53:21,730
Oh, my god. Who knows that guy?
Who knows that guy?

1022
00:53:21,732 --> 00:53:23,799
Get in, get in! He's dead!

1023
00:53:23,801 --> 00:53:26,569
Whoooo!

1024
00:53:30,474 --> 00:53:33,242
<i>They robbed six fuckin' clubs
in the last month.</i>

1025
00:53:33,244 --> 00:53:35,244
<i>They robbed the Hawaiian twice.</i>

1026
00:53:35,246 --> 00:53:37,146
<i>It's Colombo. Do you think
it was Colombo or...</i>

1027
00:53:37,148 --> 00:53:38,581
<i>I have no idea. Gambinos?</i>

1028
00:53:38,583 --> 00:53:40,082
<i>He looked high as a kite.</i>

1029
00:53:40,084 --> 00:53:42,084
<i>Yeah, took her watch
instead of her cash.</i>

1030
00:53:42,086 --> 00:53:43,419
<i>Duke, I think
I know who's doing this.</i>

1031
00:53:43,421 --> 00:53:44,753
<i>Give Johnny Lacola a call.</i>

1032
00:53:44,755 --> 00:53:46,589
<i>The cocksuckers took
my fuckin' watch!</i>

1033
00:53:46,591 --> 00:53:48,591
<i>Who would hit that place?
It's supposed to be protected.</i>

1034
00:53:48,593 --> 00:53:49,925
<i>The kid just robbed us.</i>

1035
00:53:49,927 --> 00:53:51,193
<i>No, they didn't touch bergen.</i>

1036
00:53:51,195 --> 00:53:53,062
<i>They can try.</i>

1037
00:53:54,097 --> 00:53:57,199
<i>Nah, I know rose.</i>

1038
00:53:57,201 --> 00:53:59,768
<i>I know where
their mother lives.</i>

1039
00:53:59,770 --> 00:54:01,503
<i>She's fucking crazy.</i>

1040
00:54:01,505 --> 00:54:02,938
<i>Sure, no problem.</i>

1041
00:54:02,940 --> 00:54:04,340
<i>All right, give it to me.</i>

1042
00:54:04,342 --> 00:54:08,611
<i>H529u... Something.</i>

1043
00:54:08,613 --> 00:54:10,546
Look at that.

1044
00:54:10,548 --> 00:54:11,947
I already got... aah!

1045
00:54:11,949 --> 00:54:13,616
Let it go.

1046
00:54:13,618 --> 00:54:15,017
Mmm, that's good.

1047
00:54:16,453 --> 00:54:20,956
November 22, 1992.

1048
00:54:20,958 --> 00:54:26,128
With my lovely, lovely rose.

1049
00:54:26,130 --> 00:54:29,398
My girl, my lady,
my queen, my queen bee.

1050
00:54:33,136 --> 00:54:35,304
Keep your eyes closed.

1051
00:54:35,306 --> 00:54:38,407
Are you ready? Do you trust me?

1052
00:54:38,409 --> 00:54:40,309
I trust you.

1053
00:54:47,050 --> 00:54:49,585
Up your nose. It's glitter.

1054
00:54:49,587 --> 00:54:52,321
Oh, my god.

1055
00:54:59,496 --> 00:55:00,562
You're short.

1056
00:55:00,564 --> 00:55:02,398
You're tall.

1057
00:55:07,504 --> 00:55:10,272
Do you wanna stop?

1058
00:55:10,274 --> 00:55:12,241
Are you scared?

1059
00:55:22,118 --> 00:55:23,919
I don't wanna stop.

1060
00:55:23,921 --> 00:55:26,322
You sure?

1061
00:55:35,598 --> 00:55:37,199
Hey, wait here.

1062
00:55:37,201 --> 00:55:38,634
I got something for you.

1063
00:55:38,636 --> 00:55:40,035
I thought we were
going to the diner.

1064
00:55:40,037 --> 00:55:41,537
In a minute.

1065
00:55:44,375 --> 00:55:45,708
What is it?

1066
00:55:45,710 --> 00:55:47,776
What'd you do?

1067
00:55:50,814 --> 00:55:52,381
Holy shit.

1068
00:55:52,383 --> 00:55:53,816
It's a surprise for you!

1069
00:55:53,818 --> 00:55:55,718
Holy shit.

1070
00:55:55,720 --> 00:55:57,052
"Since John gotti's conviction,

1071
00:55:57,054 --> 00:55:58,454
"there have been
reports of deaths

1072
00:55:58,456 --> 00:56:00,155
around his old stomping..."
does it say our names?

1073
00:56:00,157 --> 00:56:01,790
No.

1074
00:56:01,792 --> 00:56:03,726
"No one's really sure who's
behind these recent events,

1075
00:56:03,728 --> 00:56:05,160
"but it seems clear
that these occurrences

1076
00:56:05,162 --> 00:56:06,895
"would likely not
be taking place

1077
00:56:06,897 --> 00:56:08,497
if it wasn't for
his recent conviction."

1078
00:56:08,499 --> 00:56:09,732
How the fuck did they get this?

1079
00:56:09,734 --> 00:56:11,333
You did this? Yeah.

1080
00:56:11,335 --> 00:56:13,569
Now they all know. Yeah.

1081
00:56:13,571 --> 00:56:16,505
Holy shit. I can't
fucking believe this.

1082
00:56:16,507 --> 00:56:19,575
I'd have 'em put in
fucking stone if I could.

1083
00:56:19,577 --> 00:56:21,744
You like it?

1084
00:56:21,746 --> 00:56:23,579
Are you kidding me?

1085
00:56:23,581 --> 00:56:25,314
Are you kidding me?
I fucking love it.

1086
00:56:25,316 --> 00:56:26,982
You... i fucking love this.

1087
00:56:26,984 --> 00:56:28,684
Okay. Come here!

1088
00:56:28,686 --> 00:56:30,819
Mmm.

1089
00:56:30,821 --> 00:56:32,421
Fuckin' love it.

1090
00:56:33,690 --> 00:56:35,657
You know what?

1091
00:56:38,027 --> 00:56:39,495
You look amazing.

1092
00:56:39,497 --> 00:56:42,097
I just... I wanna
save this right here.

1093
00:56:42,099 --> 00:56:44,233
Wherever the fuck we are.

1094
00:56:46,436 --> 00:56:48,604
Just give me a second.

1095
00:56:54,043 --> 00:56:56,378
Will you marry me?

1096
00:56:56,380 --> 00:56:58,447
Don't fuck with me.
I'm not fucking with you.

1097
00:56:58,449 --> 00:57:00,616
Will you marry me?
Don't you fuck with me!

1098
00:57:00,618 --> 00:57:01,950
I'm not fucking with you!
I'm on a knee!

1099
00:57:01,952 --> 00:57:03,719
Will you marry me?

1100
00:57:03,721 --> 00:57:05,854
Come on, rose.

1101
00:57:05,856 --> 00:57:07,122
I do! I do!

1102
00:57:07,124 --> 00:57:08,857
I do!

1103
00:57:12,228 --> 00:57:13,595
Bellissimo.

1104
00:57:17,133 --> 00:57:18,967
Bene.

1105
00:57:18,969 --> 00:57:20,803
Capone was smiling or no?

1106
00:57:20,805 --> 00:57:22,638
No, he's, uh, serious.

1107
00:57:24,208 --> 00:57:25,707
Wow.

1108
00:57:25,709 --> 00:57:27,309
I wanna see the look.
I wanna see the look.

1109
00:57:27,311 --> 00:57:28,977
Okay, look at the look.

1110
00:57:28,979 --> 00:57:30,712
Look at the look.

1111
00:57:30,714 --> 00:57:32,714
First of all, my wife is
a lot better-looking

1112
00:57:32,716 --> 00:57:34,817
than Mae Coughlin,
that's all I'm gonna say.

1113
00:57:34,819 --> 00:57:36,885
You know what it is?
You got no love in your life.

1114
00:57:36,887 --> 00:57:39,488
I see the same bullshit
over and over.

1115
00:57:39,490 --> 00:57:41,223
You're all fucking miserable.

1116
00:57:41,225 --> 00:57:43,826
Each and every one of you.
You know that?

1117
00:57:43,828 --> 00:57:45,661
What town is this?

1118
00:57:45,663 --> 00:57:47,596
The town of Vizzini.

1119
00:57:47,598 --> 00:57:48,997
What is it? Vizzini.

1120
00:57:48,999 --> 00:57:51,333
Vizzini. That's what this is?

1121
00:57:51,335 --> 00:57:53,001
How come everything
looks the same?

1122
00:57:55,171 --> 00:57:57,840
Looks like a shithole.

1123
00:57:57,842 --> 00:58:00,509
We just got married!

1124
00:58:00,511 --> 00:58:02,911
Okay, now smile...
is there teeth or no teeth?

1125
00:58:02,913 --> 00:58:04,346
Little teeth.

1126
00:58:04,348 --> 00:58:06,682
Here she goes. Ah-boom!

1127
00:58:06,684 --> 00:58:08,116
Oh, you caught it!

1128
00:58:08,118 --> 00:58:09,518
You caught it!
You're gonna get married!

1129
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:11,253
You're gonna get married.
See? Married?

1130
00:58:11,255 --> 00:58:13,355
To a guy, I think.
Congratulations.

1131
00:58:13,357 --> 00:58:14,690
You know what? Drop your pants.

1132
00:58:14,692 --> 00:58:16,024
Come on, is it necessary?

1133
00:58:16,026 --> 00:58:17,259
We already gave you the money.

1134
00:58:17,261 --> 00:58:18,694
It's fuckin' necessary.

1135
00:58:18,696 --> 00:58:20,963
Drop your fuckin' pants.

1136
00:58:20,965 --> 00:58:22,364
Come on, you got the money.

1137
00:58:22,366 --> 00:58:24,800
Just leave us alone.
We're playing cards.

1138
00:58:24,802 --> 00:58:26,535
No, I know that
you were playing cards.

1139
00:58:26,537 --> 00:58:29,605
I'm not fuckin' stupid.
Drop your fuckin' pants!

1140
00:58:38,982 --> 00:58:40,716
Are you fuckin' kidding me?

1141
00:58:40,718 --> 00:58:43,385
What, do you got
the Yankees game on that?

1142
00:58:43,387 --> 00:58:45,721
You got a fuckin' rat in here?

1143
00:58:45,723 --> 00:58:47,523
I'm not a rat.

1144
00:58:49,125 --> 00:58:50,959
Nah.

1145
00:58:50,961 --> 00:58:52,528
Hey, good luck with that.

1146
00:58:54,797 --> 00:58:57,132
This is what I wanna do.
I wanna make a toast!

1147
00:58:57,134 --> 00:58:58,400
Whoo!

<i>You're listening to am 77 wabc.</i>

01:01:17,775 --> 01:01:20,375
You're fucking kidding.

1211
01:01:20,377 --> 01:01:22,878
You... listen...

1212
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:25,047
<i>In the business
of this enterprise.</i>

1213
01:01:25,049 --> 01:01:27,382
You hear that?
He wants to talk this way

1214
01:01:27,384 --> 01:01:30,385
about John while the rats
sit around and let him?

1215
01:01:30,387 --> 01:01:32,954
Fine. I don't want
to hear it anymore.

1216
01:01:32,956 --> 01:01:34,222
You think they fuckin' care?

1217
01:01:34,224 --> 01:01:36,825
Nobody cares anymore.

1218
01:01:36,827 --> 01:01:38,560
'Cause he's a fuckin' rat.

1219
01:01:38,562 --> 01:01:40,062
Fuckin' rat... rat!

1220
01:01:58,581 --> 01:02:01,016
Hey!

1221
01:02:01,018 --> 01:02:03,351
Let's go. Let's go.

1222
01:02:03,353 --> 01:02:05,654
Anthony, what? What?

1223
01:02:05,656 --> 01:02:07,756
You're coming home with me.
Where... what...

1224
01:02:07,758 --> 01:02:09,758
a few guys came
to mama's house yesterday

1225
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:11,993
asking questions,
and they weren't cops.

1226
01:02:13,362 --> 01:02:14,663
Let's go. Let's go!

1227
01:02:14,665 --> 01:02:15,931
She's not going anywhere.

1228
01:02:15,933 --> 01:02:17,499
I don't wanna fuckin'
hear it from you.

1229
01:02:17,501 --> 01:02:18,667
Hey! Hey! You hear me?

1230
01:02:18,669 --> 01:02:21,002
Anthony, hey! Relax!

1231
01:02:21,004 --> 01:02:22,170
Relax, Anthony.

1232
01:02:22,172 --> 01:02:23,605
Mama's in the hospital.

1233
01:02:23,607 --> 01:02:25,507
She had a stroke this morning.

1234
01:02:26,676 --> 01:02:28,276
When does it end, rose?

1235
01:02:28,278 --> 01:02:30,112
When does it end? Let's go!

1236
01:02:30,114 --> 01:02:31,713
Let's go, get your clothes.

1237
01:02:31,715 --> 01:02:33,115
She's not going
anywhere... rose!

1238
01:02:33,117 --> 01:02:34,382
Rose! Let's go.

1239
01:02:34,384 --> 01:02:35,550
Where are you going? Let's go.

1240
01:02:35,552 --> 01:02:37,285
Rose! It's my mom!

1241
01:02:37,287 --> 01:02:38,620
You're my wife. What're you doing?
You shut the fuck up!

1242
01:02:38,622 --> 01:02:39,888
Rose, come on,
he sold you out once.

He's gonna sell you out again.

1244
01:02:41,291 --> 01:02:42,958
I will fucking kill you.

1245
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:45,193
Hey! You understand me?

1246
01:02:45,195 --> 01:02:47,629
Anthony! You gorilla! Get off!

1247
01:02:47,631 --> 01:02:49,698
You fuckin' jackass. Get off!

1248
01:02:49,700 --> 01:02:51,700
Go!

1255
01:03:21,732 --> 01:03:25,567
<i>Free John! What do

<i>John Gotti was sentenced

<i>Hey, Thomas,
I didn't see you there.</i>

1259
01:03:37,614 --> 01:03:40,115
<i>Why weren't you there?</i>

1260
01:03:41,518 --> 01:03:44,352
<i>Every day on my radio show...</i>

1261
01:03:44,354 --> 01:03:46,021
Aaaah! <i>I will continue</i>

Fuck you!

1264

<i>Severed, and the body

Hey, Thomas, did you hear?

1273
01:04:11,714 --> 01:04:13,715
John gotti's going to jail...

1274

For life...

Without the possibility
of parole.

1276
01:04:19,288 --> 01:04:21,957
No more five families.

1277
01:04:21,959 --> 01:04:23,959
The mafia...

1278
01:04:23,961 --> 01:04:26,061
As an institution,

1279
01:04:26,063 --> 01:04:28,396
is no more.

1280
01:04:28,398 --> 01:04:29,965
Yeah.

1281
01:04:29,967 --> 01:04:34,069
So why don't you put that
in your pipe and smoke it?

1282
01:04:36,406 --> 01:04:38,240
<i>I have personal

<i>It is all smoke and mirrors.</i>

1286
01:04:44,815 --> 01:04:47,315
<i>This man's business is murder.</i>

1287
01:04:47,317 --> 01:04:49,084
<i>I get press all the time.</i>

1288
01:04:49,086 --> 01:04:50,518

01:05:01,431 --> 01:05:03,431
<i>And then I hear...
I hear they're reporting.</i>

1297

<i>Who?</i> Sliwa.

1301
01:05:13,944 --> 01:05:15,944
Fuckin' Sliwa.

1302
01:05:15,946 --> 01:05:17,612
I know exactly where he lives.

1303
01:05:17,614 --> 01:05:19,014
I need my driver.

1304
01:05:19,016 --> 01:05:21,049
What are you talking about?

1305
01:05:21,051 --> 01:05:22,784
You think I'm shit?

1306
01:05:22,786 --> 01:05:24,686
Is that what you think?

1307
01:05:24,688 --> 01:05:27,856
No. Why do you say that?
What are you talking about?

1308
01:05:27,858 --> 01:05:29,224
<i>Come on, rose, I need you.</i>

1309
01:05:29,226 --> 01:05:30,959
I need your help.

1310
01:05:30,961 --> 01:05:33,528
He takes a taxi
every morning at 7:15.

1311
01:05:35,965 --> 01:05:38,266
Thomas...

1312
01:05:42,204 --> 01:05:43,972
You're not coming in
that clear.

1313
01:05:46,142 --> 01:05:47,809
<i>You're not coming
through clear.</i>

1314
01:05:47,811 --> 01:05:49,477
<i>I think it's the pollution.</i>

1315
01:05:49,479 --> 01:05:51,980
You're coming through
in waves, rose,

1316
01:05:51,982 --> 01:05:53,915
you're coming through in waves.

1317
01:05:53,917 --> 01:05:56,651
Honey... I can't
come back right now.

1318
01:05:56,653 --> 01:05:58,253
I can't leave her yet,
not like this.

1319
01:05:58,255 --> 01:05:59,921
I'm scared for you in queens.

1320
01:05:59,923 --> 01:06:01,323
I wanna come get you.

1321
01:06:03,092 --> 01:06:04,793

I gotta go.

1324
01:06:09,333 --> 01:06:12,434
Aah! Aaaah!

1325
01:06:12,436 --> 01:06:14,102

Okay? He needs me! He needs me.

1329
01:06:21,244 --> 01:06:23,078
Tell me what kind of
trouble you're in!

1330
01:06:23,080 --> 01:06:24,846
I'm not in trouble!

1331
01:06:24,848 --> 01:06:27,682
I can help you!
I talked to Theresa.

1332
01:06:27,684 --> 01:06:31,019
She'll put you up.
You can get work up there.

1333
01:06:31,021 --> 01:06:32,854
Just get away from it all,
just get out.

1334
01:06:32,856 --> 01:06:35,323
Get away from it.

1335

Huh? That's it!

Hey! Hey! Hey! That's it!

Piece of shit! It's all over.

1349

It's over!
Make sure he stays out!

1351

You know now.

1352
01:07:34,084 --> 01:07:35,250
Don't be coming around here.

1353
01:07:35,252 --> 01:07:36,418
Take a walk, piece of shit.

1354
01:07:36,420 --> 01:07:37,919

Did I tell you?

1357
01:07:59,509 --> 01:08:02,343
I told you, Thomas.

1358
01:08:02,345 --> 01:08:05,113
Yeah, inside report said.

1359
01:08:05,115 --> 01:08:07,282
Gotti was taken
to the infirmary...

1360
01:08:07,284 --> 01:08:12,287
With a busted lip
and swelling to his cheekbone.

1361
01:08:12,289 --> 01:08:14,122

1363
01:08:16,059 --> 01:08:18,860
He had his way with
the coward of all cowards.

1364
01:08:20,963 --> 01:08:23,798
See, Thomas?

1365
01:08:23,800 --> 01:08:25,967
He is just like you.

Uh... yeah. Huh?

1372
01:08:47,824 --> 01:08:50,091
What happened?

1373
01:08:50,093 --> 01:08:52,327
Nothing.

1374
01:08:52,329 --> 01:08:53,828
Nothing?

1375
01:08:55,664 --> 01:08:57,232
I had an accident.

1376
01:08:57,234 --> 01:08:58,733
What kind of accident?

1377
01:08:59,835 --> 01:09:01,102
Where's rose?

He's here? Who's here?

1380
01:09:05,342 --> 01:09:06,841
Did you hit your head? No.

1381
01:09:06,843 --> 01:09:08,109
He's here? Turn around.

1382
01:09:08,111 --> 01:09:09,744
He said so. Sit down.

1383
01:09:09,746 --> 01:09:11,846
Come inside. I'm all right.

1384
01:09:11,848 --> 01:09:13,148
I'll give you a band-aid.

It's all right,
I don't need it.

1390
01:09:23,126 --> 01:09:24,859
No, I don't want it.
I'm on my feet.

1391
01:09:24,861 --> 01:09:26,528
You're barely on your feet, okay?
I'm on my feet.

1392
01:09:26,530 --> 01:09:27,962
I don't want it. Take it back.

1393

I don't want it.
Take your money.

01:09:29,366 --> 01:09:30,765
Take it.

1395
01:09:32,535 --> 01:09:34,102
What?

1396
01:09:35,804 --> 01:09:37,972
Come inside and let me
clean that up, okay?

1397
01:09:37,974 --> 01:09:40,975
Hey. Hey. That looks
really fuckin' bad, man.

1398
01:09:40,977 --> 01:09:42,944
You gotta do me a favor. What?

1399
01:09:42,946 --> 01:09:44,712
If you stay here,

1400
01:09:44,714 --> 01:09:45,780
it's gonna fuckin' kill you.

1401
01:09:45,782 --> 01:09:46,948
You gotta get out of here.

1402
01:09:46,950 --> 01:09:49,117
Okay. Okay. I'm serious, ally.

1403
01:09:49,119 --> 01:09:51,219
Ally. I'm going to
park Avenue tomorrow.

1404
01:09:51,221 --> 01:09:52,554
Don't go, okay?

1405
01:09:52,556 --> 01:09:55,156
You can't drive like that.
You're fucked up.

1406
01:09:55,158 --> 01:09:57,392
Wake up, Thomas, wake up!

1407
01:10:32,695 --> 01:10:35,663
I missed you.

01:10:35,665 --> 01:10:37,532
I'm here.

1409
01:10:48,677 --> 01:10:51,846
This is exactly
where I met you.

1410
01:10:51,848 --> 01:10:53,514
Huh?

1411
01:10:57,219 --> 01:11:01,122
Give the boys my best.

1412
01:11:01,124 --> 01:11:02,557
That's what they are, right?

1413
01:11:02,559 --> 01:11:05,026
Little fucking boys.

1414
01:11:41,497 --> 01:11:43,331
Is it just you?

1415
01:11:44,500 --> 01:11:45,900
Huh?

1416
01:12:02,184 --> 01:12:04,252
This is it?

1417
01:12:58,240 --> 01:13:00,375
Who's in there? Huh?

1418
01:13:02,911 --> 01:13:04,345
<i>Buona sera.</i>

1419
01:13:04,347 --> 01:13:07,081
Who else is here?
It's just you two?

1420
01:13:07,083 --> 01:13:08,750
Huh? Nobody.

1421
01:13:08,752 --> 01:13:10,251
Just you two?

1422
01:13:12,087 --> 01:13:14,055
Yeah. What about you?

1423
01:13:15,090 --> 01:13:17,091
Are you alone?

1424
01:13:18,260 --> 01:13:20,495
You mean business, huh?

1425
01:13:28,771 --> 01:13:30,671
You... you got big balls.

1426
01:14:05,407 --> 01:14:08,776
Me and you, come on.

1427
01:14:16,151 --> 01:14:18,986
John? <i>Si.</i>

1428
01:14:57,759 --> 01:14:59,627
Why is the door red?

1429
01:14:59,629 --> 01:15:01,963
The door, why is it red?

1430
01:15:06,435 --> 01:15:07,802
Nobody knows.

1431
01:15:07,804 --> 01:15:09,937
It's red.

1432
01:15:20,282 --> 01:15:21,949
We sicilians,

1433
01:15:21,951 --> 01:15:24,452
we've been grounded up
like coffee.

1434
01:15:24,454 --> 01:15:27,722
Arabic, Norman, Spanish, Greek.

1435
01:15:28,958 --> 01:15:30,958
We don't know
anymore who we are.

1436
01:15:40,235 --> 01:15:42,003
No.

1437
01:15:42,005 --> 01:15:43,404
Hmm.

1438
01:16:07,029 --> 01:16:08,496
Hmm.

1439
01:16:13,869 --> 01:16:16,003
It's a dream.

1440
01:16:16,005 --> 01:16:18,105
I wish I was there.

1441
01:16:18,107 --> 01:16:20,174
But things have
changed there, too.

1442
01:16:22,779 --> 01:16:25,446
They made the canyon
to build this guy.

1443
01:16:25,448 --> 01:16:28,849
Ah, things are not
the same anymore.

1444
01:16:30,385 --> 01:16:32,420
Got your...

1445
01:17:01,149 --> 01:17:03,317
I'm sorry.

1446
01:17:08,323 --> 01:17:10,558
There's nothing in it.

1447
01:17:12,761 --> 01:17:14,662
Look, there's a flower.

1448
01:17:23,605 --> 01:17:27,241
Go to sleep... Go to sleep...

1449
01:17:27,243 --> 01:17:28,909
Go to sleep.

1450
01:18:10,385 --> 01:18:12,953
Here he comes. Here he comes.

1451
01:18:12,955 --> 01:18:14,522
Is the light on? The light on?

1452
01:18:19,795 --> 01:18:22,396
67th and Columbus.

1453
01:18:24,733 --> 01:18:26,067
Aah!

1454
01:18:26,069 --> 01:18:27,401
Fuck! Fuck!

1455
01:18:27,403 --> 01:18:30,237
Shit!

1456
01:18:30,239 --> 01:18:31,972
Aah!

1457
01:18:34,744 --> 01:18:36,510
Go! Go!

1458
01:18:36,512 --> 01:18:37,978
Aah... help!

1459
01:18:37,980 --> 01:18:40,915
Help!

1460
01:18:40,917 --> 01:18:41,916
Aah...

1461
01:19:13,782 --> 01:19:15,216
come on... hey.

1462
01:19:15,218 --> 01:19:17,351
Hey, we gotta ditch this car.

1463
01:19:17,353 --> 01:19:19,353
I'm sorry.

1464
01:19:28,063 --> 01:19:29,797
It's okay, okay?

1465
01:19:34,569 --> 01:19:36,804
It's all over.

1466
01:19:37,639 --> 01:19:38,873
Okay?

1467
01:19:38,875 --> 01:19:41,208
It's over.

1468
01:19:45,147 --> 01:19:47,815
We don't have to do it
anymore, huh?

1469
01:19:47,817 --> 01:19:49,650
I'm sorry. I promise.

1470
01:19:52,555 --> 01:19:54,655
Don't cry, baby.

1471
01:19:54,657 --> 01:19:56,991
Don't... don't cry.

1472
01:19:56,993 --> 01:19:59,093
It... it's okay.

thank you.

1488
01:20:43,705 --> 01:20:45,439
Two lobster tails.

1489
01:20:46,708 --> 01:20:48,209
Just two?

1490
01:20:49,978 --> 01:20:52,279
Your brother Anthony
was in this morning.

1491
01:20:52,281 --> 01:20:54,648
Hmm.

1492
01:20:54,650 --> 01:20:56,951
I guess you don't see him much.

1493
01:20:56,953 --> 01:21:00,221
The baby is so cute.

1494
01:21:00,223 --> 01:21:02,122
Mmm.

1495
01:21:03,625 --> 01:21:05,025
What about you, rose?

1496
01:21:08,330 --> 01:21:09,630
What about me?

1497
01:21:11,233 --> 01:21:13,300
When are you having one?

1498
01:21:14,803 --> 01:21:16,470
I'm pregnant, Annie.

1499
01:21:17,806 --> 01:21:19,240
Oh.

1500
01:21:19,242 --> 01:21:20,975
I didn't know.

1501
01:21:24,246 --> 01:21:26,180
Who's the father?

1502
01:21:26,182 --> 01:21:28,749
The ice cream man.

1503
01:22:31,546 --> 01:22:33,881
Ahh...

1504
01:22:40,422 --> 01:22:42,790
Sliwa's not dead.

1505
01:22:44,559 --> 01:22:47,227
They're saying
junior's boys shot him.

1506
01:22:51,599 --> 01:22:54,668
I don't even know
what to believe anymore.

1507
01:22:55,904 --> 01:22:57,171
Where you wanna go?

1508
01:23:01,076 --> 01:23:03,310
Why don't we just
drive around for a while?

1509
01:23:07,515 --> 01:23:10,584
It's all these people.

1510
01:23:10,586 --> 01:23:12,519
I don't know.

1511
01:23:26,034 --> 01:23:27,101
What?

1512
01:23:41,449 --> 01:23:42,983
Hey, close your eyes.

1513
01:23:42,985 --> 01:23:44,318
What? Shh.

1514
01:23:44,320 --> 01:23:46,053
Oh, what are you...

1515
01:23:46,055 --> 01:23:47,654
Shh.
