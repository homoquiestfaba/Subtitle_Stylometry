1
00:03:36,559 --> 00:03:38,197
American?

2
00:03:40,462 --> 00:03:41,717
No doubt.

3
00:03:42,255 --> 00:03:45,136
Now since when did the Americans
start working for the Russians?

4
00:03:49,167 --> 00:03:52,026
The images on this draw
won't serve you in the least.

5
00:03:54,191 --> 00:03:55,480
Go!

6
00:03:59,023 --> 00:04:01,489
Artillery placements,
troop movements,

7
00:04:01,582 --> 00:04:04,409
these images won't aid
the cause of American men.

8
00:04:04,752 --> 00:04:06,454
They are just currency.

9
00:04:06,542 --> 00:04:08,921
Currency traded at
the cost of my people.

10
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:11,831
First, your foot.

11
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,834
Then, your knee.

12
00:04:16,431 --> 00:04:18,930
Blow torch
to cauterize the wound.

13
00:04:20,847 --> 00:04:22,266
One.

14
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:24,468
Two.

15
00:04:26,415 --> 00:04:29,394
- Three!
- Okay, I'll give you the code!

16
00:04:36,336 --> 00:04:37,808
Give me the code.

17
00:04:40,494 --> 00:04:42,449
You need my thumbprint...

18
00:04:42,543 --> 00:04:44,410
before entering the code.

19
00:04:44,495 --> 00:04:45,816
I swear.

20
00:04:57,807 --> 00:04:59,225
Hurry!

21
00:05:04,272 --> 00:05:05,777
Come on, come on!

22
00:05:11,407 --> 00:05:12,825
Code error.

23
00:05:14,063 --> 00:05:15,634
Now, we'll all die.

24
00:05:42,991 --> 00:05:45,074
20 seconds to auto-destruct.

25
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:49,398
Everyone out now! Now!

26
00:06:01,712 --> 00:06:03,577
Auto-destruct aborted.

27
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:19,765
Fire!

28
00:06:44,271 --> 00:06:45,875
Go! Go! Go! Go!

29
00:07:45,647 --> 00:07:47,316
Did I park it close enough?

30
00:08:06,159 --> 00:08:07,512
Did you get the drives?

31
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:08,625
I got them.

32
00:08:08,719 --> 00:08:10,039
Outstanding.

33
00:08:10,127 --> 00:08:11,447
Let's go home.

34
00:09:45,327 --> 00:09:47,858
I've got a lone boogey
coming in from above.

35
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:51,345
Confirm the boogey
He's coming in hard and fast.

36
00:09:52,463 --> 00:09:54,001
Let's see what he wants.

37
00:09:56,655 --> 00:09:58,936
What the hell?
This thing's all over me.

38
00:10:05,934 --> 00:10:07,801
Get this thing off of me!

39
00:10:07,887 --> 00:10:09,425
I'm all over him.

40
00:10:09,518 --> 00:10:10,904
Fire it!

41
00:10:16,271 --> 00:10:18,770
Green deck
Let's make sure it's neutralized.

42
00:10:21,102 --> 00:10:22,521
Stay sharp.

43
00:10:22,607 --> 00:10:24,177
Staying sharp-

44
00:10:25,295 --> 00:10:26,713
What the fuck?

45
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:29,656
I'm losing control.

46
00:10:30,703 --> 00:10:32,241
Get out of there!

47
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:36,307
I've lost control.
Repeat, I've lost control.

48
00:10:42,222 --> 00:10:43,444
Rosnibich, come in!

49
00:10:43,535 --> 00:10:45,368
Rosnibich, come in!
I'm under attack.

50
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:17,872
Hello.
Hello.

51
00:11:17,967 --> 00:11:19,440
You got a cigarette?

52
00:11:32,368 --> 00:11:33,905
Want a date?

53
00:11:33,998 --> 00:11:35,504
Already got one.

54
00:11:36,526 --> 00:11:37,945
Too bad.

55
00:11:48,367 --> 00:11:49,972
Well, hello there.

56
00:12:20,174 --> 00:12:21,712
You're my doctor?

57
00:12:21,807 --> 00:12:23,377
Yeah.

58
00:12:24,591 --> 00:12:26,871
I got your medication right here.

59
00:12:30,478 --> 00:12:32,694
Take one preferably without food.

60
00:12:32,783 --> 00:12:35,216
Repeat as necessary
until pain subsides.

61
00:12:43,151 --> 00:12:45,105
Bavaro wants us right away.

62
00:13:19,951 --> 00:13:22,100
Congratulations on the op
in Chechnya.

63
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:23,856
Oh, thank you, sir.

64
00:13:23,951 --> 00:13:25,718
Now, tell me something useful.

65
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:28,787
Chemical weapon plants.
Hum, good.

66
00:13:28,879 --> 00:13:30,995
Well, we'll get these coordinates
off to the military.

67
00:13:31,087 --> 00:13:33,433
Congratulations, gentlemen.
That was an excellent recovery.

68
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:34,992
Thank you.
Thank you, sir.

69
00:13:35,503 --> 00:13:37,969
Oh, gentlemen, by the way
Don't get too comfortable!

70
00:13:38,063 --> 00:13:40,082
We have another situation.

71
00:13:40,175 --> 00:13:44,725
An unidentified inbound came down
over eastern Russia 7 hours ago.

72
00:13:44,815 --> 00:13:46,135
But we just left.

73
00:13:46,222 --> 00:13:48,088
Then maybe
you should have just stayed.

74
00:13:49,454 --> 00:13:51,986
An unspecified
displacement signature.

75
00:13:52,078 --> 00:13:53,464
One of their experimental jets?

76
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:57,587
Well, if it is, its propulsion
system isn't fossil fuel based.

77
00:13:57,679 --> 00:14:00,309
And so what you're saying
is it isn't earth-based.

78
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:01,653
What I'm saying is

79
00:14:01,743 --> 00:14:04,656
it's unspecified...
for the time being.

80
00:14:12,302 --> 00:14:14,135
Thank you, gentlemen,
you can go.

81
00:14:16,046 --> 00:14:18,032
But I'm keeping you both
on active.

82
00:14:18,127 --> 00:14:20,113
But...that means
no leaving the base.

83
00:14:20,207 --> 00:14:21,648
I know.

84
00:14:25,007 --> 00:14:26,425
Forget Vegas.

85
00:15:09,262 --> 00:15:11,478
Hey! Wait a second!

86
00:15:12,526 --> 00:15:13,999
No cheating.

87
00:15:47,151 --> 00:15:48,591
What are you doing here?

88
00:15:49,295 --> 00:15:50,997
I'm looking for someone.

89
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:53,395
You have come with me.

90
00:16:02,542 --> 00:16:04,146
Ziggi!

91
00:16:09,039 --> 00:16:10,577
Demitri!

92
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,009
Demitri!

93
00:16:52,495 --> 00:16:55,124
Corporal,
where are you taking that weapon?

94
00:18:55,022 --> 00:18:57,074
Lambert,
Bavaro wants you up front.

95
00:19:03,694 --> 00:19:05,014
Lambert.

96
00:19:08,207 --> 00:19:11,414
We have new intel
on the Russian situation.

97
00:19:11,439 --> 00:19:13,654
In my office in 15?

98
00:19:13,742 --> 00:19:15,313
That's very good.

99
00:19:26,959 --> 00:19:29,337
The displacement signature is the
same as the ones in Yellowknife.

100
00:19:29,422 --> 00:19:31,888
And El Descanso
and the other sites.

101
00:19:31,982 --> 00:19:34,034
So what you're saying is
they're back.

102
00:19:34,126 --> 00:19:36,309
What I'm saying is they match.

103
00:19:36,399 --> 00:19:38,930
Then one of these things wiped
out your entire team last time?

104
00:19:39,023 --> 00:19:41,238
Yeah, we had to drop
a tactical nuke.

105
00:19:41,326 --> 00:19:43,225
That must have been
a public relations nightmare.

106
00:19:43,311 --> 00:19:46,486
Well, gentlemen, this time
we don't have that option.

107
00:19:47,567 --> 00:19:51,222
That is a Russian military base
40 kilometers east of Grozny.

108
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:56,595
Excuse me.

109
00:19:57,775 --> 00:19:59,444
Demitri Pavakori.

110
00:19:59,534 --> 00:20:01,935
According to his record,
an excellent soldier.

111
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:05,390
He used a Kanashnikov
EM-7 rocket launcher

112
00:20:05,486 --> 00:20:07,222
to take the camp out.

113
00:20:08,943 --> 00:20:12,118
And no personality disorders
no mental illnesses.

114
00:20:12,207 --> 00:20:14,738
Well, maybe Demitri
was not really Demitri.

115
00:20:15,823 --> 00:20:17,143
I'm sure he's missing now.

116
00:20:17,231 --> 00:20:19,282
There has been no trace of him
since the base attack.

117
00:20:21,519 --> 00:20:23,439
If it's a pattern
of assimilations.

118
00:20:23,534 --> 00:20:25,717
We took these transcripts
a few days ago

119
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:28,501
from a couple of
Russian MiG-29 fighters

120
00:20:28,591 --> 00:20:31,450
intercepting
an unknown hostile target

121
00:20:31,535 --> 00:20:33,521
on a direct course for Grozny.

122
00:20:35,438 --> 00:20:36,824
Get out of there!

123
00:20:36,911 --> 00:20:38,231
I'm losing control.

124
00:20:38,318 --> 00:20:40,217
Rosnibich, come in!
I'm under attack.

125
00:20:46,479 --> 00:20:48,083
There's more.

126
00:20:48,174 --> 00:20:51,829
The same displacement signatures
Incredible turn ratio.

127
00:20:51,918 --> 00:20:53,424
So this thing is looking
more and more like

128
00:20:53,518 --> 00:20:55,667
the same thing you dealt with
four years ago in El Descanso.

129
00:20:55,758 --> 00:20:58,258
- It fits the pattern.
- Well, that's just great!

130
00:20:58,351 --> 00:21:01,711
I want you to take an I Force
team and go back to Russia.

131
00:21:02,478 --> 00:21:03,952
When do I pick my team?

132
00:21:05,902 --> 00:21:07,025
You don't.

133
00:21:07,118 --> 00:21:09,398
Well, if it's my mission
then it's my team.

134
00:21:09,486 --> 00:21:10,872
Negative.

135
00:21:10,958 --> 00:21:13,555
I Forces have been government
funded for two years now.

136
00:21:13,646 --> 00:21:15,762
You're no longer
a private contractor.

137
00:21:15,854 --> 00:21:17,425
We pick the teams.

138
00:21:18,927 --> 00:21:20,978
Maybe we should continue
this conversation outside.

139
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:23,700
If you wanna say something, just
say it in front of everybody.

140
00:21:26,255 --> 00:21:27,859
Webber's gone.

141
00:21:27,951 --> 00:21:30,263
You are no longer a gun for hire.

142
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:32,631
You are employed
by an organization

143
00:21:32,719 --> 00:21:34,518
that reports directly to the NSC,

144
00:21:34,606 --> 00:21:37,912
the CIA, the FBI and ultimately
the president himself.

145
00:21:37,998 --> 00:21:40,431
You are required to
execute your orders

146
00:21:40,527 --> 00:21:42,839
in exactly the manner
in which they are given to you.

147
00:21:42,927 --> 00:21:45,142
Now I've got a lot of
other people out there.

148
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:47,030
Do you want this mission or not?

149
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:51,958
When do we leave?

150
00:21:52,046 --> 00:21:54,065
I want you prepped and ready
to leave by 1800.

151
00:21:54,158 --> 00:21:55,991
Wait a minute! Why so fast?

152
00:21:56,078 --> 00:21:57,715
Can't the Russians control
things for a while?

153
00:21:57,806 --> 00:21:58,614
No.

154
00:21:58,702 --> 00:21:59,694
Come on, Jack!

155
00:21:59,791 --> 00:22:00,915
The Russians wouldn't accept
out assistance

156
00:22:01,007 --> 00:22:02,741
unless it was something worse.

157
00:22:02,831 --> 00:22:04,501
Why was the base really attacked?

158
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:05,944
We don't know.

159
00:22:06,734 --> 00:22:09,015
But it's not the base
that's of prime importance.

160
00:22:09,774 --> 00:22:11,312
It's what's next to it.

161
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:13,559
Here.

162
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:21,107
Chernobyl era plant
upgraded in '92.

163
00:22:22,798 --> 00:22:25,973
That is one hyper-fusion reactor.

164
00:22:26,062 --> 00:22:28,463
Which makes a lovely byproduct.

165
00:22:28,558 --> 00:22:31,023
Uranium 237.

166
00:22:31,119 --> 00:22:32,406
237?

167
00:22:32,495 --> 00:22:35,638
The worst of the worst
of the uranium byproduct class.

168
00:22:35,726 --> 00:22:37,527
A Chernobyl-level release
from that baby

169
00:22:37,614 --> 00:22:40,342
would make Three Mile Island
look like a leaky faucet.

170
00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:42,034
Yeah, this just
keeps getting better.

171
00:22:42,126 --> 00:22:43,993
We have to get
that thing out of there

172
00:22:44,078 --> 00:22:46,642
with no collateral damage.

173
00:22:47,534 --> 00:22:48,724
I see.

174
00:22:49,934 --> 00:22:51,571
This is your new team.

175
00:22:56,846 --> 00:22:58,581
McCallister you already know.

176
00:22:59,982 --> 00:23:01,401
Adriana Sikes.

177
00:23:05,166 --> 00:23:08,526
Expert in demolition.
She's military trained.

178
00:23:08,623 --> 00:23:10,422
She's done many operations
with the DEA

179
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:12,943
both in and out
of the United States.

180
00:23:18,029 --> 00:23:20,114
She's clearly
not a lady to piss off.

181
00:23:21,391 --> 00:23:23,093
Bjorn Hatch.

182
00:23:24,975 --> 00:23:26,960
Former German special forces.

183
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:30,773
He's a weapons
and combat specialist.

184
00:23:31,342 --> 00:23:33,459
Not the most polished operative,

185
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:36,344
but an invaluable asset
on any mission.

186
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:40,081
That is your team.

187
00:23:48,463 --> 00:23:50,994
Mr. Bavaro, I'm been working on
replicated samples

188
00:23:51,086 --> 00:23:53,519
of this antibiotic material
taken from Yellowknife.

189
00:23:53,614 --> 00:23:55,185
And when using a focused
microwave beamer...

190
00:23:55,278 --> 00:23:56,118
Microwave?

191
00:23:56,206 --> 00:23:57,843
Remember?
I designed the core filament,

192
00:23:57,935 --> 00:23:59,189
sent it over
to the Weapons Division?

193
00:23:59,278 --> 00:24:00,020
Right.

194
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:02,030
Well, I was hoping it would
be possible to test them on...

195
00:24:02,126 --> 00:24:03,731
There's no time for that.

196
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:06,899
Faulker, I want
the I Force transport fueled

197
00:24:06,990 --> 00:24:08,660
and on the runway ASAP.

198
00:24:36,974 --> 00:24:38,644
Shut down the reactor!
Shut them off!

199
00:24:38,734 --> 00:24:39,607
Seal the core!

200
00:24:39,694 --> 00:24:41,843
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!

201
00:24:42,542 --> 00:24:43,831
Hurry, hurry!

202
00:24:43,917 --> 00:24:45,522
Hurry! Hurry!

203
00:24:52,686 --> 00:24:54,072
The team is ready, sir.

204
00:24:54,990 --> 00:24:56,528
Good.

205
00:24:56,622 --> 00:24:58,324
You have ten minutes to get them
down to the air strip.

206
00:24:58,414 --> 00:24:59,921
You're shipping out right now.

207
00:25:00,526 --> 00:25:01,847
I thought it was 1800.

208
00:25:01,934 --> 00:25:04,434
The nuclear plant at Grozny
has been taken.

209
00:25:04,526 --> 00:25:07,440
There's no contact.
No word of hostages or survivors.

210
00:25:07,534 --> 00:25:09,967
Hell, we don't even know
if the reactor still online.

211
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:13,209
What about the radiation levels?

212
00:25:13,294 --> 00:25:14,418
No word.

213
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:16,081
Listen, that nuclear plant
has six times

214
00:25:16,174 --> 00:25:18,291
as much uranium fuel
as the one in Chernobyl.

215
00:25:18,381 --> 00:25:21,296
If it starts leaking,
the whole world gets a taste.

216
00:25:21,390 --> 00:25:22,679
I know.

217
00:25:44,558 --> 00:25:47,636
Lambert, I need you to
take along another team member.

218
00:25:49,743 --> 00:25:51,030
Who?

219
00:25:51,117 --> 00:25:52,438
Her.

220
00:25:57,741 --> 00:25:58,679
Who is she?

221
00:25:58,766 --> 00:26:00,119
Science Division.

222
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:04,719
- No.
- Yes.

223
00:26:05,294 --> 00:26:05,970
No.

224
00:26:06,062 --> 00:26:09,106
I want you to take a
science officer along with you.

225
00:26:09,199 --> 00:26:10,835
Now you call me when you land.

226
00:26:10,926 --> 00:26:13,457
The weather satellite shows
a major storm system heading in,

227
00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:15,023
so it's gonna be a rough ride
over there.

228
00:26:15,117 --> 00:26:16,984
Anymore surprises, Jack?

229
00:26:17,071 --> 00:26:18,543
Not from you.

230
00:26:19,117 --> 00:26:20,656
'Cuz you're gonna
obey my orders over there,

231
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:22,834
exactly as I give them to you.

232
00:26:22,926 --> 00:26:24,563
No exceptions.

233
00:26:24,655 --> 00:26:26,095
You understand?

234
00:26:32,495 --> 00:26:33,782
Hi!

235
00:26:33,869 --> 00:26:35,255
Dawn De Silvia.

236
00:26:43,630 --> 00:26:46,031
Look, I know I'm not trained
in combat or missions,

237
00:26:46,126 --> 00:26:48,505
but I'll try to do my part.

238
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:50,096
Just strap in.

239
00:27:31,438 --> 00:27:32,943
Little motion sickness?

240
00:27:34,414 --> 00:27:35,351
Look, I don't mean to be rude,

241
00:27:35,438 --> 00:27:37,718
but what the hell
are you here for?

242
00:27:37,806 --> 00:27:38,995
I brought along some...

243
00:27:39,086 --> 00:27:41,040
some reading material
for you to take a look at.

244
00:27:46,542 --> 00:27:49,303
Nuclear site emergency
procedures and containment.

245
00:27:49,391 --> 00:27:51,474
- What the hell is this?
- We just found out.

246
00:27:52,558 --> 00:27:53,812
Did you know about this?

247
00:27:53,902 --> 00:27:55,920
They figure the specimen
might go for the plant,

248
00:27:56,015 --> 00:27:57,585
just not so fast.

249
00:27:57,679 --> 00:27:59,926
But the Russian government
wants to keep it quiet.

250
00:28:00,013 --> 00:28:02,545
They have assigned us a Russian
commander to work with us.

251
00:28:03,118 --> 00:28:05,169
What's the specimen
doing with the power plant?

252
00:28:05,262 --> 00:28:06,833
It's our job to find out.

253
00:28:06,926 --> 00:28:09,970
My gig's ops. I'm not trained
for radiation work.

254
00:28:10,894 --> 00:28:12,247
Me either.

255
00:28:12,334 --> 00:28:13,905
Okay, I'll make you a deal.

256
00:28:13,998 --> 00:28:16,398
When we get there, if
the labels outside are too hot.

257
00:28:17,293 --> 00:28:19,345
We'll abort. Deal?

258
00:28:20,429 --> 00:28:21,936
I go if you don't.

259
00:28:22,766 --> 00:28:24,054
Deal.

260
00:28:25,614 --> 00:28:27,000
Deal.

261
00:28:29,134 --> 00:28:31,349
What about you, princess?
Are you cool with this?

262
00:28:49,550 --> 00:28:51,536
Hey, be careful!

263
00:28:53,390 --> 00:28:54,808
Please.

264
00:29:33,518 --> 00:29:34,871
Put that down!

265
00:29:39,501 --> 00:29:41,204
It's hell of a welcome wagon.

266
00:29:41,902 --> 00:29:43,921
Aren't these chuckle heads
supposed to be working with us?

267
00:29:44,014 --> 00:29:45,236
Yeah.

268
00:29:58,957 --> 00:30:00,594
Welcome to Russia, Mr. Lambert

269
00:30:01,615 --> 00:30:03,633
- Commander.
- You've heard about us.

270
00:30:03,726 --> 00:30:05,232
Mr. McCallister.

271
00:30:11,182 --> 00:30:14,674
Commander, is there any radiation
leaks outside the plant?

272
00:30:14,765 --> 00:30:17,711
Levels are normal,
but it's better to be safe, yes?

273
00:30:19,598 --> 00:30:21,072
Any words on the workers?

274
00:30:21,166 --> 00:30:23,763
Nothing.
All communication has been cut.

275
00:30:28,878 --> 00:30:30,067
No.

276
00:30:30,158 --> 00:30:32,624
I have specimen samples
in those cases. No!

277
00:30:32,718 --> 00:30:34,835
They'll be fine.
Yeah, we'll see.

278
00:30:35,437 --> 00:30:38,515
<i>No, no, no.</i>

279
00:30:40,429 --> 00:30:42,994
No, no.

280
00:30:43,086 --> 00:30:45,040
No, not!

281
00:30:48,815 --> 00:30:50,419
The seal's good.

282
00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:51,983
Let me handle this.

283
00:30:58,094 --> 00:30:59,829
It doesn't look so dangerous.

284
00:31:00,653 --> 00:31:02,673
You should see what happens
if they get loose.

285
00:31:03,823 --> 00:31:06,135
The containers have microwave
transmitters inside.

286
00:31:07,342 --> 00:31:09,077
It keeps the samples
from growing.

287
00:31:10,222 --> 00:31:11,957
Follow me to the plant.

288
00:31:17,902 --> 00:31:20,815
Our report said that
you were at the plant

289
00:31:20,910 --> 00:31:22,896
when your base was attacked.

290
00:31:22,989 --> 00:31:24,692
Yes. Why?

291
00:31:26,863 --> 00:31:29,328
- Just lucky for you.
- Yes.

292
00:32:10,255 --> 00:32:11,542
We can get to the main reactor

293
00:32:11,629 --> 00:32:13,942
through access
in the cooling tower.

294
00:32:14,638 --> 00:32:16,340
I'll take my men to the
first sub-level

295
00:32:16,430 --> 00:32:18,229
and later radio for your team.

296
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:21,016
Hey, general, you're kidding.

297
00:32:22,478 --> 00:32:24,049
This is not why we came here.

298
00:32:24,142 --> 00:32:26,194
You're invited guests
of the Russian government.

299
00:32:26,285 --> 00:32:28,664
You are brought here because you may
have some experience

300
00:32:28,751 --> 00:32:30,321
in dealing with this.

301
00:32:31,183 --> 00:32:32,404
Sounds like BS to me.

302
00:32:32,494 --> 00:32:34,294
We didn't come here to baby-sit.

303
00:32:35,341 --> 00:32:37,426
Are you prepared for
what might be inside?

304
00:32:37,517 --> 00:32:40,595
My soldiers are prepared to
handle anything they find inside.

305
00:32:41,614 --> 00:32:43,894
Now, Mr. Lambert,
if you don't mind.

306
00:32:50,350 --> 00:32:51,408
Bavaro.

307
00:32:51,501 --> 00:32:52,975
Yeah, we're outside the plant.

308
00:32:53,869 --> 00:32:57,808
Well, I'll go ahead and assume
that there's no radiation leak.

309
00:32:57,902 --> 00:33:01,208
Yeah, the plant is in one piece
Radiation levels are normal.

310
00:33:01,295 --> 00:33:03,607
But Gorshkov won't let us go in.

311
00:33:03,694 --> 00:33:05,396
He's sending his men
in first, Jack.

312
00:33:05,486 --> 00:33:08,116
- What?
- Yup, he wants us to wait outside.

313
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:09,842
Did he say why?

314
00:33:09,934 --> 00:33:11,288
I'm in Russia, Jack.

315
00:33:11,374 --> 00:33:13,294
Under the command of
a Russian general.

316
00:33:13,966 --> 00:33:15,504
Did you advise him
of the situation?

317
00:33:15,597 --> 00:33:16,951
Yes, I did.

318
00:33:19,118 --> 00:33:22,228
- Well, you hold your post.
- And do what?

319
00:33:22,317 --> 00:33:23,888
At the moment,
we have the specimen

320
00:33:23,982 --> 00:33:25,271
contained inside the plant.

321
00:33:25,358 --> 00:33:27,890
If it gets outside again,
we have a much bigger problem.

322
00:33:29,901 --> 00:33:31,734
Lambert, do you understand?

323
00:33:31,821 --> 00:33:33,938
Let Gorshkov go in first.

324
00:33:40,046 --> 00:33:43,058
- Well? Do we dance?
- We wait.

325
00:33:43,150 --> 00:33:45,463
Why did Bavaro send us here
just to sit on the bench?

326
00:33:45,550 --> 00:33:46,609
What's going on?

327
00:33:46,702 --> 00:33:48,175
Remember, we're in Russia?

328
00:33:49,038 --> 00:33:50,805
It sure isn't the French Riviera.

329
00:33:59,149 --> 00:34:00,688
So you got a deck of cards?

330
00:34:09,133 --> 00:34:11,088
Who are you eyeballing, Boris?

331
00:34:11,181 --> 00:34:12,753
Sexy G.I.

332
00:34:52,494 --> 00:34:54,033
Remember this?

333
00:34:54,125 --> 00:34:55,730
Yeah.

334
00:34:56,462 --> 00:34:58,480
Electromagnetic disruptor.

335
00:34:58,574 --> 00:35:00,494
Used once in El Descanso.

336
00:35:00,589 --> 00:35:01,616
Which exploded the specimen,

337
00:35:01,709 --> 00:35:03,859
but didn't keep it
from performing, right?

338
00:35:03,949 --> 00:35:05,554
You're right.

339
00:35:05,645 --> 00:35:07,697
That's why the Science Division
developed this.

340
00:35:12,429 --> 00:35:13,902
Microwave rifle.

341
00:35:17,229 --> 00:35:19,663
It is much better
than your EMG disruptor.

342
00:35:19,758 --> 00:35:21,558
I hope so.

343
00:35:21,646 --> 00:35:23,381
Oh, Hatch's favorite toy.

344
00:35:23,470 --> 00:35:24,943
Chain gun.

345
00:35:25,038 --> 00:35:27,799
Packed with 300 pieces
of razor chain.

346
00:35:31,502 --> 00:35:33,139
Used for rock cutting.

347
00:35:35,694 --> 00:35:37,331
Razor chain.

348
00:35:43,149 --> 00:35:45,333
Continuing search
Radio is on channel four.

349
00:35:56,877 --> 00:35:58,831
Once the specimen
assimilates an organism,

350
00:35:58,926 --> 00:36:01,458
it then stores that information
in cellular memory.

351
00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:03,449
You wanna give us
the English version?

352
00:36:03,534 --> 00:36:05,302
It means that the specimen
can look like

353
00:36:05,389 --> 00:36:07,572
anyone it has assimilated before,

354
00:36:08,781 --> 00:36:10,419
not just the last person.

355
00:36:11,438 --> 00:36:13,838
The tissue is silicone-based.
It's very tough

356
00:36:13,934 --> 00:36:16,596
Very resistant to temperature
and impact.

357
00:36:16,685 --> 00:36:19,512
It can also camouflage itself
to hide in its surroundings,

358
00:36:19,598 --> 00:36:20,690
like a chameleon.

359
00:36:20,781 --> 00:36:22,287
The bottom line.
How do we kill it?

360
00:36:22,382 --> 00:36:24,696
Well, use the microwave gun
the best we can.

361
00:36:24,782 --> 00:36:27,128
Come up with another way to
destroy the binding structure.

362
00:36:45,422 --> 00:36:47,255
Where is it coming from?

363
00:36:47,342 --> 00:36:49,208
It seems to be
from the reactor room.

364
00:37:17,102 --> 00:37:18,423
What was that?

365
00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:19,950
I don't know, sir.

366
00:37:20,718 --> 00:37:22,006
Come on.

367
00:37:45,422 --> 00:37:47,189
Commander,
should we call for the Americans?

368
00:37:47,277 --> 00:37:48,630
Not yet.

369
00:38:06,637 --> 00:38:08,143
Gorshkov, do you read me?

370
00:38:09,550 --> 00:38:10,871
Gorshkov!

371
00:38:20,237 --> 00:38:22,038
You are to stay out here.

372
00:38:22,126 --> 00:38:24,079
Until the commander
gives us the orders

373
00:38:24,174 --> 00:38:25,461
for your team to enter.

374
00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:27,449
Your men are dying in there.

375
00:38:27,534 --> 00:38:29,815
We'll wait for orders.

376
00:38:29,902 --> 00:38:31,822
I told you your men
are dying in there.

377
00:38:31,917 --> 00:38:33,969
I said we'll wait for orders.

378
00:38:35,789 --> 00:38:37,077
Well, what are you gonna do?

379
00:38:37,166 --> 00:38:38,355
Shoot me?

380
00:38:38,669 --> 00:38:40,721
No, I won't shoot you.

381
00:38:43,342 --> 00:38:45,174
Leave your weapons on the ground!

382
00:38:51,757 --> 00:38:53,590
I think you just bought yourself
an old-fashioned

383
00:38:53,677 --> 00:38:55,630
sort of Russian ass-whopping.

384
00:39:08,269 --> 00:39:11,150
- Guys!
- Remember me, baby?

385
00:39:26,606 --> 00:39:29,552
Lambert! Guys! Oh, my God!

386
00:39:35,661 --> 00:39:37,910
Your commander and his men
are getting killed in there.

387
00:39:38,638 --> 00:39:40,721
We're going to go in
and help them out.

388
00:39:41,933 --> 00:39:43,319
All right?

389
00:39:54,286 --> 00:39:55,574
Let's go!

390
00:39:58,670 --> 00:40:00,339
My equipment. I'm a scientist.

391
00:40:03,310 --> 00:40:04,815
You're a soldier now.

392
00:40:16,366 --> 00:40:17,751
Ready, Hatch?

393
00:40:17,838 --> 00:40:19,191
Big time.

394
00:40:36,942 --> 00:40:38,448
We're in.

395
00:42:41,742 --> 00:42:43,182
Commander, we need backup.

396
00:42:43,277 --> 00:42:47,282
Listen to me, we have to
clean up our mess in here first.

397
00:42:47,374 --> 00:42:48,760
You understand?

398
00:43:03,789 --> 00:43:06,550
For three years,
I have kept this operation

399
00:43:06,638 --> 00:43:09,944
hidden from the energy counsel,
police and RSS.

400
00:43:09,966 --> 00:43:12,792
I have billion dollars
in black market weapons.

401
00:43:12,877 --> 00:43:14,864
I want them all moved out.

402
00:43:14,957 --> 00:43:16,179
Commander, how?

403
00:43:16,269 --> 00:43:18,899
The entire facility is
under attack by that creature.

404
00:43:18,989 --> 00:43:21,848
Then called in Lambert's team.
Let them deal with it.

405
00:43:21,933 --> 00:43:22,925
Then they've killed it.

406
00:43:23,022 --> 00:43:24,888
We'll report that
the reactor is leaking.

407
00:43:24,973 --> 00:43:26,840
That will
keep everyone out of here

408
00:43:26,925 --> 00:43:28,017
for at least a week.

409
00:43:28,109 --> 00:43:30,193
That's when we move
the war heads.

410
00:43:30,285 --> 00:43:32,665
- Commander, are you sure?
- Listen to me.

411
00:43:32,750 --> 00:43:34,419
We have to get back to the top

412
00:43:34,509 --> 00:43:36,211
and get Lambert's team inside.

413
00:43:36,302 --> 00:43:37,807
If we're lucky, they'll kill it.

414
00:43:37,902 --> 00:43:39,604
And we'll be back in business.

415
00:43:40,493 --> 00:43:41,814
Yes, commander.

416
00:43:48,845 --> 00:43:50,231
Move.

417
00:44:35,214 --> 00:44:37,047
The reactor's intact.

418
00:44:37,133 --> 00:44:38,967
I got no signal.

419
00:44:39,053 --> 00:44:40,973
We're in the core.
It's the lead walls.

420
00:44:41,805 --> 00:44:43,791
All right,
I'll try the access area.

421
00:44:45,197 --> 00:44:47,030
Everybody stays here.

422
00:44:47,117 --> 00:44:48,590
You sure?

423
00:44:48,685 --> 00:44:50,104
I'll be right back.

424
00:45:07,597 --> 00:45:09,616
What do you mean
you can't locate the commander?

425
00:45:09,709 --> 00:45:12,175
Well, we heard gunfire,
we entered the plant.

426
00:45:12,269 --> 00:45:13,774
We haven't found him yet.

427
00:45:13,870 --> 00:45:15,769
What's the status
outside the plant?

428
00:45:15,853 --> 00:45:17,872
Well, Gorshkov's men
still got it locked down.

429
00:45:17,966 --> 00:45:20,595
Is there any further evidence
of the specimen?

430
00:45:20,686 --> 00:45:22,737
No, no visual yet, but...

431
00:45:23,885 --> 00:45:25,490
it's definitely been in here.

432
00:45:25,581 --> 00:45:26,770
Casualties?

433
00:45:26,862 --> 00:45:29,689
Well, the specimen
took the entire facility

434
00:45:29,774 --> 00:45:31,573
and most of Gorshkov's team.

435
00:45:31,662 --> 00:45:34,456
Okay,
so now it's containment procedure

436
00:45:34,542 --> 00:45:37,171
and exterminate the specimen.

437
00:45:37,261 --> 00:45:39,345
- We still have to find it.
- You will.

438
00:45:40,174 --> 00:45:41,592
Listen, one more thing

439
00:45:41,677 --> 00:45:43,892
I think Gorshkov
is hiding something from us.

440
00:45:43,982 --> 00:45:45,334
Based on?

441
00:45:45,421 --> 00:45:47,375
The fact that
he wants to keep us out.

442
00:45:47,469 --> 00:45:49,718
Well, maybe he's just
being a good soldier

443
00:45:49,805 --> 00:45:52,304
and keeping the civilian teams
out of harm's way.

444
00:45:52,397 --> 00:45:55,027
- I don't think so.
- Investigate if you must.

445
00:45:55,117 --> 00:45:59,056
But remember, your priority is
containment and extermination.

446
00:45:59,149 --> 00:46:00,534
Roger that.

447
00:46:13,581 --> 00:46:15,894
Somebody help us!
Please help us!

448
00:46:25,549 --> 00:46:27,600
You don't work here.

449
00:46:27,694 --> 00:46:30,258
I think he still lives.

450
00:46:30,349 --> 00:46:32,368
Get up very slowly, please.

451
00:46:37,773 --> 00:46:39,890
Now turn and face me.

452
00:47:01,165 --> 00:47:03,151
Okay, so what are we
gonna do about this?

453
00:47:03,246 --> 00:47:05,145
Give him a few minutes.
He's probably fine.

454
00:47:10,925 --> 00:47:13,391
What's wrong?
Afraid to fight a woman?

455
00:47:47,309 --> 00:47:49,077
The fun is just starting.

456
00:47:54,413 --> 00:47:55,668
Who are you?

457
00:47:55,758 --> 00:47:58,104
You have more spirit
in your fight.

458
00:47:58,189 --> 00:48:00,022
I'm just visiting.

459
00:48:00,109 --> 00:48:01,462
Where are your friends?

460
00:48:02,605 --> 00:48:04,243
Where are your friends?

461
00:48:07,822 --> 00:48:09,721
I came a long way for this.

462
00:48:13,325 --> 00:48:14,285
For what?

463
00:48:14,381 --> 00:48:16,978
To destroy your world
with the poisons you create.

464
00:48:17,070 --> 00:48:19,252
And one other thing. Revenge.

465
00:48:19,341 --> 00:48:21,240
But you won't live to find out.

466
00:48:22,349 --> 00:48:23,954
Is there more of you here?

467
00:48:27,149 --> 00:48:29,975
One of me is enough
to destroy your kind.

468
00:48:31,501 --> 00:48:34,000
I've got some shocking news
for you, lady.

469
00:48:46,957 --> 00:48:48,147
Sean, are you all right?

470
00:48:48,237 --> 00:48:49,491
He's headed back here.

471
00:48:49,581 --> 00:48:51,119
Something's chasing him.

472
00:48:53,517 --> 00:48:56,278
What? I said he's probably fine.

473
00:48:56,365 --> 00:48:58,067
How are we gonna know
it's really him?

474
00:48:58,158 --> 00:48:59,544
- Who?
- Lambert.

475
00:48:59,629 --> 00:49:01,047
Cut it out!

476
00:49:10,381 --> 00:49:11,800
Get behind.

477
00:49:15,373 --> 00:49:16,791
Get ready.

478
00:49:19,565 --> 00:49:20,951
Now!

479
00:49:29,165 --> 00:49:31,184
Go on in, Sikes. Check it out.

480
00:49:31,277 --> 00:49:33,296
Lady's first, McCallister.

481
00:49:33,389 --> 00:49:34,610
I'll go.

482
00:49:34,701 --> 00:49:35,989
Wait!

483
00:49:45,806 --> 00:49:47,311
Got more bodies here.

484
00:49:48,686 --> 00:49:50,126
They were Gorshkov's guys.

485
00:50:07,309 --> 00:50:08,727
We've been sweeping
the entire facilitie.

486
00:50:08,812 --> 00:50:10,417
One contact for nothing.

487
00:50:10,510 --> 00:50:12,725
So we go topside
and wait for that thing to move.

488
00:50:12,813 --> 00:50:15,442
The Russians are dead.
Gorshkov's probably dead too.

489
00:50:15,885 --> 00:50:17,522
This is a real swell mission.

490
00:50:17,614 --> 00:50:19,512
You know, we're walking around
some Russian nuke plant,

491
00:50:19,597 --> 00:50:21,551
probably designed by the same guy
who brought us Chernobyl.

492
00:50:21,644 --> 00:50:23,729
- We're breathing in poison.
- Give it a rest!

493
00:50:23,821 --> 00:50:25,741
How do I know princess here is
reading the geiger counter right

494
00:50:25,837 --> 00:50:27,223
and we're not getting fried?

495
00:50:27,309 --> 00:50:29,012
- Check it yourself.
- Hey!

496
00:50:29,101 --> 00:50:31,699
Looks to me like another
El Descanso is about to go down.

497
00:50:31,788 --> 00:50:33,207
You were the sole
survivor there, Lambert.

498
00:50:33,294 --> 00:50:34,450
How did you get so lucky?

499
00:50:34,541 --> 00:50:37,203
- Come on, Sikes. Relax!
- I didn't pick you.

500
00:50:37,293 --> 00:50:38,516
Quiet!

501
00:50:57,261 --> 00:50:58,767
Don't shoot!

502
00:50:59,022 --> 00:51:00,888
If you don't want
to get your head blown off...

503
00:51:00,973 --> 00:51:03,952
The creature,
it killed my soldiers.

504
00:51:04,045 --> 00:51:05,550
We have to go.

505
00:51:05,645 --> 00:51:06,802
All right,
we'll get you out of here.

506
00:51:06,893 --> 00:51:08,334
Come on, let's go!

507
00:51:14,157 --> 00:51:15,314
All right, this way?

508
00:51:15,405 --> 00:51:17,075
This way. To the elevator shaft.

509
00:51:19,725 --> 00:51:20,947
Lambert, come on,
let's get out of here!

510
00:51:21,038 --> 00:51:22,675
I thought it was the other way.

511
00:51:24,748 --> 00:51:26,287
Gorshkov!

512
00:51:26,381 --> 00:51:27,821
Commander Gorshkov!

513
00:51:48,141 --> 00:51:49,265
You just shot
a Russian commander.

514
00:51:49,357 --> 00:51:50,928
We're never gonna get out
of this country alive!

515
00:51:51,021 --> 00:51:52,494
- Calm down!
- What?

516
00:51:52,973 --> 00:51:54,446
Give it to me.

517
00:51:55,597 --> 00:51:57,267
The gun's down.

518
00:51:57,357 --> 00:51:58,798
Come on, let's go!

519
00:52:24,910 --> 00:52:26,579
How did you know that really
wasn't Gorshkov back there?

520
00:52:26,669 --> 00:52:28,087
I'm paid to know.

521
00:52:47,182 --> 00:52:48,719
We're running out of ammo.

522
00:52:50,957 --> 00:52:52,245
Aim for the weapon!

523
00:52:52,333 --> 00:52:53,839
Sikes, give me your gun.

524
00:52:55,789 --> 00:52:56,879
No, Hatch!

525
00:53:02,157 --> 00:53:03,794
Hatch!

526
00:53:06,477 --> 00:53:07,699
Sean.

527
00:53:16,333 --> 00:53:18,232
You had to be a hero, huh?

528
00:53:18,318 --> 00:53:19,790
Yeah.

529
00:53:21,772 --> 00:53:23,311
Cover me!

530
00:54:00,269 --> 00:54:01,360
You're all right?

531
00:54:01,454 --> 00:54:02,358
Yeah.

532
00:54:02,445 --> 00:54:03,733
Come on!

533
00:54:09,122 --> 00:54:10,563
He's gone.

534
00:54:10,657 --> 00:54:12,076
I know.

535
00:54:14,145 --> 00:54:15,848
Who's next?

536
00:54:19,713 --> 00:54:21,220
It's getting away.

537
00:54:36,033 --> 00:54:37,834
You'd better come up with
something to kill it fast,

538
00:54:37,922 --> 00:54:39,875
because we're out of chain guns.

539
00:54:41,218 --> 00:54:42,572
Lambert!

540
00:55:10,786 --> 00:55:13,033
- These are old S-7s.
- S what?

541
00:55:13,121 --> 00:55:14,922
S-7 nuclear warheads.

542
00:55:15,554 --> 00:55:17,059
One megaton each.

543
00:55:17,153 --> 00:55:19,205
I mean, they were retired
from the old Soviet military

544
00:55:19,297 --> 00:55:21,764
maybe 20 years ago.
And most were destroyed

545
00:55:21,857 --> 00:55:23,559
or at least
the nuclear material removed,

546
00:55:23,650 --> 00:55:25,636
but these warheads are armed.

547
00:55:25,730 --> 00:55:28,425
What would they be doing
inside a nuclear power plant?

548
00:55:28,513 --> 00:55:30,532
My research on the plant
shows an abnormal use

549
00:55:30,626 --> 00:55:33,320
of uranium-235
for the last three years so...

550
00:55:33,729 --> 00:55:35,083
Which is why Gorshkov
was so concerned

551
00:55:35,170 --> 00:55:36,872
about us getting in here.

552
00:55:36,962 --> 00:55:38,980
And finding out about
his little secret.

553
00:55:39,073 --> 00:55:40,164
Maybe he was using the uranium

554
00:55:40,258 --> 00:55:41,763
from the power plant
to build nukes.

555
00:55:41,857 --> 00:55:42,762
What for?

556
00:55:42,850 --> 00:55:43,788
A lot of money.

557
00:55:43,873 --> 00:55:44,899
You know,
it still doesn't explain

558
00:55:44,994 --> 00:55:46,084
what this creature's doing here.

559
00:55:46,178 --> 00:55:48,077
I mean, what about the one
from El Descanso.

560
00:55:48,162 --> 00:55:49,319
Yeah, what about it?

561
00:55:49,409 --> 00:55:51,014
Well, did you ever find out
why it was there?

562
00:55:51,105 --> 00:55:52,710
I mean, before you destroyed it.

563
00:55:52,802 --> 00:55:54,569
They nuked the town, remember?

564
00:55:56,034 --> 00:55:57,507
Wait a second.

565
00:56:03,233 --> 00:56:05,449
These warheads are wired to
some kind of detonator.

566
00:56:05,538 --> 00:56:07,240
Are you telling me
that this lunatic Gorshkov

567
00:56:07,330 --> 00:56:10,722
was not only building nukes
but was gonna detonate them too?

568
00:56:10,817 --> 00:56:11,876
Not Gorshkov.

569
00:56:11,969 --> 00:56:13,639
What, you think
this thing did this?

570
00:56:13,730 --> 00:56:15,203
You know what?
We're not gonna wait to find out.

571
00:56:15,298 --> 00:56:16,290
I'm gonna cut the wires.

572
00:56:16,386 --> 00:56:17,477
No!

573
00:56:18,946 --> 00:56:21,324
The S-7 has
a mercury switch beneath.

574
00:56:21,889 --> 00:56:23,658
You cut it, you detonate it.

575
00:56:25,281 --> 00:56:27,497
We can only defuse it
from the detonator.

576
00:56:32,481 --> 00:56:34,664
All right, Sikes.

577
00:56:34,753 --> 00:56:36,586
You're staying here
with McCallister.

578
00:56:37,922 --> 00:56:39,624
And you're coming with me.

579
00:56:41,474 --> 00:56:42,728
Repeat, move in.

580
00:56:42,817 --> 00:56:44,106
Let's go!

581
00:57:04,865 --> 00:57:06,982
I guess we know where
the detonator is now.

582
00:57:08,770 --> 00:57:11,235
The water
shields the uranium rods.

583
00:57:11,330 --> 00:57:14,603
With this type of reactor,
the water's lethal.

584
00:57:14,689 --> 00:57:16,392
That's just great!

585
00:57:16,482 --> 00:57:18,982
The warheads will level
an area six miles wide.

586
00:57:19,073 --> 00:57:21,256
And along with this reactor,

587
00:57:21,346 --> 00:57:24,521
the fall out will be 1000 times
greater than Chernobyl.

588
00:57:24,610 --> 00:57:26,529
It's a worldwide problem.

589
00:57:26,626 --> 00:57:29,420
I mean, possibly 100 million dead
in the next 12 months.

590
00:57:32,705 --> 00:57:35,302
No, I wouldn't do that.

591
00:57:35,394 --> 00:57:37,193
Someone's gonna
have to go down there.

592
00:57:37,282 --> 00:57:38,308
Yeah.

593
00:57:42,946 --> 00:57:45,226
McCallister, do you read me?

594
00:57:45,314 --> 00:57:47,114
Yeah, where are you guys?

595
00:57:47,201 --> 00:57:48,522
We're at the core.

596
00:57:48,609 --> 00:57:50,923
Listen,
I can't get a signal from here.

597
00:57:51,010 --> 00:57:52,996
So I want you to use your phone

598
00:57:53,089 --> 00:57:54,562
and relay a call for me.

599
00:57:54,658 --> 00:57:56,262
All right, what is it?

600
00:57:56,353 --> 00:57:57,772
Listen carefully!

601
00:58:00,929 --> 00:58:02,567
Excuse me, people!

602
00:58:02,658 --> 00:58:05,059
I've just been informed
that our situation in Grozny

603
00:58:05,153 --> 00:58:06,442
could well end
with the detonation

604
00:58:06,530 --> 00:58:08,134
of multiple nuclear devices.

605
00:58:09,089 --> 00:58:13,672
From the description, it seems
like ten S-7 class ICBM warheads

606
00:58:13,761 --> 00:58:16,195
have been configured
for simultaneous detonation

607
00:58:16,290 --> 00:58:17,959
inside the plant.

608
00:58:18,049 --> 00:58:22,120
Now, I need blast radius
and fall out patterns now.

609
00:58:22,210 --> 00:58:23,628
What do they know
about the detonator?

610
00:58:23,713 --> 00:58:25,186
Nothing, except that it's
at the bottom

611
00:58:25,282 --> 00:58:26,787
of the reactor's cooling tank.

612
00:58:26,882 --> 00:58:27,907
Can they see a timing device?

613
00:58:28,001 --> 00:58:29,704
Nope, we don't know
how much time is left.

614
00:58:29,794 --> 00:58:31,332
We can insert
an engineering team.

615
00:58:31,425 --> 00:58:33,739
They could drain the cooling tank
and shut down the reactor.

616
00:58:33,826 --> 00:58:34,818
We don't have that option.

617
00:58:34,913 --> 00:58:36,484
There's no time
for a second team insertion.

618
00:58:36,577 --> 00:58:38,727
Whatever help or information
that we get

619
00:58:38,818 --> 00:58:41,579
has to be made use of
by the team that's already there.

620
00:58:41,666 --> 00:58:44,066
The clock is literally ticking,
ladies and gentlemen.

621
00:58:44,161 --> 00:58:46,082
Every second counts.

622
00:58:46,177 --> 00:58:47,912
McCallister,
I'm not gonna just sit here

623
00:58:48,002 --> 00:58:49,834
with ten megatons wired to blow.

624
00:58:49,922 --> 00:58:51,754
It's painless.
You won't feel a thing.

625
00:58:51,841 --> 00:58:53,194
That's very funny.

626
00:58:55,810 --> 00:58:57,642
You've only got maybe
one or two shots left.

627
00:58:57,730 --> 00:58:58,668
It's almost dead.

628
00:58:58,753 --> 00:58:59,779
Well, I'm gonna
go to the reactor.

629
00:58:59,874 --> 00:59:01,444
I'm not gonna wait here
for Armageddon.

630
00:59:01,537 --> 00:59:03,457
Well, you think you're gonna be
any safer down there?

631
00:59:03,553 --> 00:59:06,347
The blast radius on one of these
babies are at least five miles.

632
00:59:06,433 --> 00:59:09,314
I know that, McCallister,
but maybe I can do something.

633
00:59:09,410 --> 00:59:11,975
So you're gonna
leave me, alone.

634
00:59:12,065 --> 00:59:13,222
You're a big boy

635
00:59:13,313 --> 00:59:15,845
Just, you know, sit there
and make phone calls to Lambert.

636
00:59:32,386 --> 00:59:33,739
Where is McCallister?

637
00:59:33,825 --> 00:59:35,244
He's back at the warheads.

638
00:59:36,034 --> 00:59:37,474
You left him alone?

639
00:59:37,569 --> 00:59:39,435
You know, just sitting in that
place was giving me the creeps

640
00:59:39,522 --> 00:59:41,092
without those wired nukes.

641
00:59:58,593 --> 01:00:00,394
You guys don't look any better.

642
01:00:17,857 --> 01:00:19,811
And you think this place
is any safer?

643
01:00:28,065 --> 01:00:30,314
Don't even think about it
I am fine.

644
01:00:30,402 --> 01:00:31,973
Think about what?

645
01:00:47,138 --> 01:00:48,555
Lambert, do you read me?

646
01:00:49,090 --> 01:00:50,082
Yeah, go ahead.

647
01:00:50,177 --> 01:00:51,651
I found a live one here.

648
01:00:51,745 --> 01:00:53,546
One of Gorshkov's soldiers?

649
01:00:53,634 --> 01:00:55,500
No, a plant worker.

650
01:00:55,585 --> 01:00:57,124
The guy's alive, but...

651
01:00:58,338 --> 01:00:59,178
Lambert.

652
01:00:59,265 --> 01:01:01,513
McCallister, you're breaking up.
Say it again.

653
01:01:03,457 --> 01:01:06,054
I want you to go back in there
and get McCallister.

654
01:01:06,146 --> 01:01:07,171
You go.

655
01:01:07,265 --> 01:01:09,219
I'm not going to
leave you alone with her.

656
01:01:09,921 --> 01:01:11,689
If you bring back McCallister,

657
01:01:12,289 --> 01:01:15,301
I'll be sure at least one of you
is who you say you are.

658
01:01:59,426 --> 01:02:00,844
McCallister?

659
01:02:04,289 --> 01:02:06,089
McCallister.

660
01:02:06,178 --> 01:02:07,748
Okay, what have we got?

661
01:02:11,426 --> 01:02:12,844
The S-7.

662
01:02:14,049 --> 01:02:16,232
It's primitive.
Early Russian design.

663
01:02:17,633 --> 01:02:19,139
It's gonna be a problem.

664
01:02:20,194 --> 01:02:23,337
This thing was built to
fail safe detonation.

665
01:02:24,801 --> 01:02:27,266
Descriptions of the wiring
make it nearly impossible

666
01:02:27,362 --> 01:02:29,282
for them to disarm
at the warhead.

667
01:02:29,377 --> 01:02:32,389
I mean, it would take them hours
of checking the lines

668
01:02:32,481 --> 01:02:35,874
and cutting the power on each one
for them to even have a chance.

669
01:02:35,969 --> 01:02:38,828
We need to get to the detonator.

670
01:02:38,913 --> 01:02:41,827
The real problem is we don't know
how much time is left.

671
01:02:44,930 --> 01:02:46,348
Sir.

672
01:02:46,433 --> 01:02:49,128
We have to think the way
it thinks.

673
01:02:50,049 --> 01:02:51,882
Now, suppose
you were the specimen,

674
01:02:51,969 --> 01:02:53,770
how much time would you put
on the detonator?

675
01:02:53,857 --> 01:02:55,941
- Maybe two hours.
- Too generous.

676
01:02:56,034 --> 01:02:57,604
An hour, if we're lucky.

677
01:02:58,882 --> 01:03:01,675
Now, all we need is to know
when it was set.

678
01:03:02,978 --> 01:03:05,509
And if we can get someone
to that detonator on time.

679
01:03:07,490 --> 01:03:09,803
Going into the cooling tank
would be suicide.

680
01:03:13,089 --> 01:03:14,378
I know.

681
01:03:25,537 --> 01:03:26,923
Damn it, McCallister!

682
01:03:27,521 --> 01:03:29,834
Geez, Sikes
Feeling froggy, are we?

683
01:03:31,234 --> 01:03:33,001
You should be careful
where you point that thing.

684
01:03:33,953 --> 01:03:36,267
I heard you on the radio
Did you find somebody?

685
01:03:36,353 --> 01:03:37,608
Yeah.

686
01:03:49,793 --> 01:03:51,114
Where did he go?

687
01:03:51,201 --> 01:03:52,259
You tell me.

688
01:03:52,354 --> 01:03:53,674
He was right here.

689
01:03:54,274 --> 01:03:55,943
I... I left him to find you.

690
01:03:57,154 --> 01:03:58,888
He was right here. I swear it.

691
01:03:58,978 --> 01:04:01,161
Well, where did that plant worker
run off to, then?

692
01:04:01,249 --> 01:04:03,017
I don't know, but he was here.

693
01:04:03,105 --> 01:04:04,775
McCallister!

694
01:04:04,866 --> 01:04:07,844
- Go!
- How's that plant worker doing?

695
01:04:07,937 --> 01:04:09,574
He's gone.

696
01:04:09,666 --> 01:04:10,691
What?

697
01:04:10,785 --> 01:04:12,488
I left him
to go hook up with Sikes,

698
01:04:12,577 --> 01:04:14,824
came back and he was gone.

699
01:04:14,913 --> 01:04:16,899
I want you both back here now.

700
01:04:17,889 --> 01:04:19,363
You ready?

701
01:04:19,457 --> 01:04:21,159
Whenever you are.

702
01:04:21,250 --> 01:04:22,635
After you.

703
01:04:24,417 --> 01:04:26,731
I don't think so.

704
01:04:26,818 --> 01:04:28,455
You take the front.

705
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:46,379
What?

706
01:04:46,466 --> 01:04:47,623
What happened to him?

707
01:04:47,713 --> 01:04:49,612
Look, the guy was right in front
of me when I called it in.

708
01:04:49,697 --> 01:04:52,360
I left him alone for 30 seconds,
came back, he was gone.

709
01:04:52,449 --> 01:04:53,867
No, McCallister.

710
01:04:53,952 --> 01:04:55,459
What really happened
to that worker?

711
01:04:55,553 --> 01:04:57,507
Better yet, was there a worker?

712
01:04:57,601 --> 01:04:59,620
Oh, I see, so I'm the alien now.

713
01:04:59,713 --> 01:05:01,830
- Let's find out.
- Screw yourself.

714
01:05:04,641 --> 01:05:06,246
You're not going with this,
are you, Sean?

715
01:05:10,305 --> 01:05:12,454
Let me ask you a question.

716
01:05:12,545 --> 01:05:14,793
- Proof who you are.
- Don't flip this on me!

717
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:17,226
Well, should we put into a vote
to see who's telling the truth?

718
01:05:18,465 --> 01:05:19,621
Thank you.

719
01:05:19,714 --> 01:05:21,896
Now this witch hunt is over
can we continue the mission?

720
01:05:21,985 --> 01:05:23,371
Wait!

721
01:05:25,185 --> 01:05:26,690
What now, Sikes?

722
01:05:26,786 --> 01:05:29,001
I just don't believe your story.

723
01:05:29,089 --> 01:05:30,792
He wasted that worker.

724
01:05:30,882 --> 01:05:32,268
I don't know where
the real McCallister is,

725
01:05:32,353 --> 01:05:33,607
but this isn't him.

726
01:05:34,529 --> 01:05:36,515
Don't move!

727
01:05:36,609 --> 01:05:38,792
Keep pointing
that thing at me, Sikes.

728
01:05:38,881 --> 01:05:40,518
It'll be the last thing you do.

729
01:05:40,609 --> 01:05:41,963
I am right here.

730
01:05:43,425 --> 01:05:45,095
You're barking up the wrong tree.

731
01:05:46,018 --> 01:05:48,396
- Sean!
- Both of you, back off.

732
01:05:51,169 --> 01:05:52,555
Back off!

733
01:06:04,609 --> 01:06:05,930
Sikes.

734
01:06:06,785 --> 01:06:08,390
Put it down!

735
01:06:18,306 --> 01:06:20,837
Everybody watch out!
It's gonna come out of his body!

736
01:06:24,482 --> 01:06:25,834
Wait!

737
01:06:31,264 --> 01:06:33,032
You knew it was me, right?

738
01:06:34,690 --> 01:06:36,424
Sean!

739
01:06:36,513 --> 01:06:38,346
You knew, didn't you?

740
01:06:43,169 --> 01:06:45,068
It's not him.

741
01:07:09,313 --> 01:07:10,818
Mr. President.

742
01:07:10,913 --> 01:07:12,135
I recommend
putting Air Force One

743
01:07:12,225 --> 01:07:14,276
into secure air space
immediately.

744
01:07:14,369 --> 01:07:17,195
And call the G8 countries
and inform them of the situation.

745
01:07:18,817 --> 01:07:20,137
Yes, sir.

746
01:07:23,554 --> 01:07:25,256
God help us all!

747
01:07:44,930 --> 01:07:47,395
Hey, Sikes. What are you doing?

748
01:07:47,489 --> 01:07:49,508
I thought
I'd go for a little swim.

749
01:07:51,233 --> 01:07:52,870
Someone's gotta
get the detonator.

750
01:07:52,961 --> 01:07:54,566
You don't have to do this.

751
01:07:54,657 --> 01:07:56,360
Someone has to.

752
01:07:56,449 --> 01:07:58,763
Sikes. Don't do it!

753
01:07:59,777 --> 01:08:00,999
Come on, Lambert.

754
01:08:01,090 --> 01:08:02,857
You knew one of us
was gonna have to do this.

755
01:08:04,513 --> 01:08:05,834
It's our job.

756
01:08:06,849 --> 01:08:08,006
No.

757
01:08:21,345 --> 01:08:22,731
Sean.

758
01:08:24,801 --> 01:08:25,859
Get back!

759
01:08:25,953 --> 01:08:28,419
You know what I hate most
about the human body?

760
01:08:30,242 --> 01:08:31,846
It breaks too easy.

761
01:08:40,672 --> 01:08:43,978
Oh, your weapon does not
seem to be functioning.

762
01:08:44,065 --> 01:08:45,418
It's out of power.

763
01:08:45,506 --> 01:08:47,590
The last shot was wasted
on your friend.

764
01:08:49,313 --> 01:08:50,851
I liked that one.

765
01:08:50,945 --> 01:08:52,451
Fearless.

766
01:08:52,544 --> 01:08:54,924
- Like someone I knew.
- Who?

767
01:08:55,010 --> 01:08:57,257
He came here before me.

768
01:08:57,345 --> 01:08:59,745
Arrived at the place El Descanso.

769
01:08:59,841 --> 01:09:01,707
Four years ago?

770
01:09:01,792 --> 01:09:04,389
You were there, weren't you?

771
01:09:04,481 --> 01:09:06,183
You destroyed him.

772
01:09:06,273 --> 01:09:08,140
You took him from me!

773
01:09:08,226 --> 01:09:10,124
He was my mate!

774
01:09:10,209 --> 01:09:13,352
Your husband wiped out
an entire town and my team.

775
01:09:14,849 --> 01:09:16,290
And on this planet...

776
01:09:22,081 --> 01:09:23,619
that tends to upset people.

777
01:09:31,361 --> 01:09:33,958
- You took my mate?
- Yeah.

778
01:09:34,049 --> 01:09:35,882
Now I take yours.

779
01:09:35,969 --> 01:09:36,929
What?

780
01:09:37,025 --> 01:09:39,339
No, he's not. I mean,
we're barely even friends.

781
01:09:40,449 --> 01:09:42,086
Go! Go!

782
01:09:50,369 --> 01:09:51,788
Where's the commander?

783
01:10:45,121 --> 01:10:47,172
We have to keep it away
from the cooling tank.

784
01:10:47,265 --> 01:10:50,124
We are running out of ammo!

785
01:10:55,489 --> 01:10:57,355
- Seven minutes.
- Can you disarm it?

786
01:10:57,441 --> 01:10:58,881
I think so.

787
01:10:58,977 --> 01:11:01,509
The problem is I don't know if
I can hold my breathe that long.

788
01:11:01,601 --> 01:11:03,238
It's down really deep.
Good luck!

789
01:11:03,521 --> 01:11:05,125
Thanks.

790
01:11:16,001 --> 01:11:17,474
Yes, sir, I understand.

791
01:11:19,713 --> 01:11:21,350
Switch to NORAD.

792
01:11:26,465 --> 01:11:27,753
Who are they?

793
01:11:27,841 --> 01:11:30,274
That's a joint Russian-American
task force.

794
01:11:30,369 --> 01:11:32,552
They're carrying
deep impact missiles.

795
01:11:32,641 --> 01:11:34,213
If we don't have an answer
in five minutes,

796
01:11:34,305 --> 01:11:35,559
they're gonna launch.

797
01:11:35,649 --> 01:11:39,555
I need Lambert on the wire now.

798
01:11:39,648 --> 01:11:40,969
Yes, sir.

799
01:11:45,825 --> 01:11:47,658
All American and Russian pilots!

800
01:11:47,746 --> 01:11:49,513
I'm speaking to you
personally today.

801
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:51,019
Not only
as the American president,

802
01:11:51,105 --> 01:11:53,091
but also
as an arm forces veteran.

803
01:11:53,184 --> 01:11:54,789
As your commanders have told you,

804
01:11:54,882 --> 01:11:57,129
the situation in eastern Russia
has turned critical

805
01:11:57,216 --> 01:11:59,562
and unfortunately,
we have few options.

806
01:11:59,649 --> 01:12:02,409
Today, we are forced to accept
the lesser of two evils.

807
01:12:02,497 --> 01:12:04,035
If the ten warheads inside

808
01:12:04,130 --> 01:12:06,213
the Grozny nuclear plant
are detonated,

809
01:12:06,305 --> 01:12:08,104
it will cause a massive
radiation cloud

810
01:12:08,193 --> 01:12:10,626
that will kill
millions upon millions worldwide.

811
01:12:10,720 --> 01:12:13,318
No person, no nation,
will be safe.

812
01:12:13,409 --> 01:12:16,584
By firing deep impact missiles
at the base of the nuclear plant,

813
01:12:16,672 --> 01:12:18,888
we have a chance
to localize this problem.

814
01:12:19,457 --> 01:12:20,395
We believe that the warheads

815
01:12:20,481 --> 01:12:22,565
can be destroyed
prior to detonation.

816
01:12:22,657 --> 01:12:25,384
And that most of the nuclear fuel
in the plant will be vaporized

817
01:12:25,473 --> 01:12:27,721
before it can be released
into the atmosphere.

818
01:12:27,809 --> 01:12:30,919
It's not a perfect plan,
nor is it without consequence.

819
01:12:31,010 --> 01:12:33,094
But the price of freedom
is paid by the people

820
01:12:33,184 --> 01:12:35,334
who defend it
in its hour of need.

821
01:12:35,424 --> 01:12:38,371
There are American and Russian
personnel inside the plant

822
01:12:38,465 --> 01:12:40,331
and they
have accepted their fate.

823
01:12:40,416 --> 01:12:42,665
Now I respectfully ask you
to accept yours

824
01:12:42,752 --> 01:12:45,317
and preserve what life
can be spared.

825
01:12:45,410 --> 01:12:46,762
Godspeed!

826
01:12:46,849 --> 01:12:48,868
The fate of the world
rides with you.

827
01:13:01,024 --> 01:13:03,338
- The timer?
- Less than two minutes.

828
01:13:03,425 --> 01:13:05,608
I still have three links
to disconnect.

829
01:13:05,697 --> 01:13:07,235
Hey, Sikes!

830
01:13:07,329 --> 01:13:08,486
What?

831
01:13:08,577 --> 01:13:10,050
It's okay.

832
01:13:10,145 --> 01:13:11,749
I just don't wanna screw it up.

833
01:13:20,769 --> 01:13:22,885
Reporting zero barrier
Lock and load.

834
01:13:38,016 --> 01:13:39,588
Less than one minute.

835
01:13:40,161 --> 01:13:41,667
You can do it.

836
01:14:40,577 --> 01:14:42,214
It's been fun.

837
01:14:56,737 --> 01:14:58,536
Firing!

838
01:15:08,417 --> 01:15:10,054
Recharged.

839
01:15:38,017 --> 01:15:39,970
Three seconds left.

840
01:15:40,065 --> 01:15:43,011
Pretty soon I'll be able to
apologize to McCallister myself.

841
01:16:05,216 --> 01:16:07,617
This is Sean.
The nukes are neutralized.

842
01:16:07,713 --> 01:16:09,099
Lambert!

843
01:16:09,184 --> 01:16:11,585
A joint Russian-U-S- task force

844
01:16:11,681 --> 01:16:13,797
launched a
deep impact missile attack

845
01:16:13,889 --> 01:16:15,939
- two minutes ago.
- What?

846
01:16:16,033 --> 01:16:17,932
You have to clear
the facility immediately.

847
01:16:18,017 --> 01:16:20,745
How? We're at least half an hour
from the top of the plant!

848
01:16:21,889 --> 01:16:25,129
People, we have four minutes
to transmit override codes

849
01:16:25,217 --> 01:16:26,308
to all those missiles.

850
01:16:26,401 --> 01:16:27,306
There's over 50.

851
01:16:27,393 --> 01:16:29,063
Well, that means we have
an awful lot of work to do.

852
01:16:29,152 --> 01:16:30,920
And not much time to do it.
Come on!

853
01:16:38,464 --> 01:16:41,094
- Oh my God! It's locked.
- We're trapped.

854
01:16:43,137 --> 01:16:44,904
Wait!

855
01:16:44,993 --> 01:16:46,892
Some of these containers
had sulfuric acid.

856
01:16:48,416 --> 01:16:50,533
And the alien is silicone-based.

857
01:16:51,137 --> 01:16:52,642
So?

858
01:16:52,737 --> 01:16:54,058
So caustic compounds,
they destroy

859
01:16:54,145 --> 01:16:55,880
the binding structure
in silicone.

860
01:16:55,969 --> 01:16:57,540
We have to open the tanks.

861
01:17:02,689 --> 01:17:04,522
Can't trust your eyes now!

862
01:17:04,609 --> 01:17:06,628
Like you trusted your friend
with the gun?

863
01:17:40,353 --> 01:17:42,338
You're nothing
without your weapon.

864
01:17:50,465 --> 01:17:51,818
How many left?

865
01:17:52,736 --> 01:17:53,249
Five.

866
01:17:53,345 --> 01:17:55,331
Initiate auto-destruct
on whatever is still hot.

867
01:17:59,617 --> 01:18:02,017
The last four are GPS locked.
This is gonna take a minute.

868
01:18:24,448 --> 01:18:26,849
Lambert, get up.
It's on the move.

869
01:19:41,664 --> 01:19:43,269
Sort of burns...

870
01:19:44,096 --> 01:19:45,482
doesn't it?

871
01:20:13,377 --> 01:20:15,526
Sorry,
I can't join you for a swim.

872
01:20:16,640 --> 01:20:18,179
But maybe you should do it.

873
01:20:18,273 --> 01:20:21,383
Or go take a dip in the reactors
pool like your friend Sikes.

874
01:20:23,520 --> 01:20:24,994
I'm still here.

875
01:20:25,089 --> 01:20:27,435
High and dry.

876
01:20:27,521 --> 01:20:31,110
You're such a clever man,
aren't ya?

877
01:20:31,201 --> 01:20:34,693
I should end our little game,
but I'm having too much fun.

878
01:21:03,840 --> 01:21:05,739
Is that all you got?

879
01:21:05,824 --> 01:21:07,656
You are a barrel of laughs.

880
01:21:13,793 --> 01:21:15,430
Speaking of barrels.

881
01:21:19,201 --> 01:21:21,383
You need to do better than that.

882
01:21:27,937 --> 01:21:29,574
Looks like you took a hit.

883
01:21:33,633 --> 01:21:35,400
Batter up.

884
01:22:23,040 --> 01:22:24,262
Got them.

885
01:22:26,944 --> 01:22:28,777
Transmit now.

886
01:22:28,865 --> 01:22:30,119
Done.

887
01:22:49,601 --> 01:22:51,206
Specimen destroyed.

888
01:22:53,089 --> 01:22:55,206
I repeat, specimen destroyed.

889
01:22:55,776 --> 01:22:57,282
Yes!

890
01:22:59,745 --> 01:23:00,902
Yes!

891
01:23:00,993 --> 01:23:02,530
Okay, man.

892
01:23:10,336 --> 01:23:12,355
Well, it doesn't get
much closer than that.

893
01:23:43,745 --> 01:23:45,217
Yes, sir.

894
01:23:46,593 --> 01:23:48,513
One moment.

895
01:23:48,608 --> 01:23:50,082
It's the White House.

896
01:23:51,649 --> 01:23:53,286
Yes. Hello, Mr. President.

897
01:23:56,993 --> 01:23:58,913
Are you okay?

898
01:23:59,008 --> 01:24:01,192
It's just hard to lose a friend.

899
01:24:04,577 --> 01:24:06,115
Yes. Thank you, sir.

900
01:24:06,208 --> 01:24:07,746
Just one moment.

901
01:24:21,377 --> 01:24:22,729
Well, I'm sorry, Mr. President.

902
01:24:22,817 --> 01:24:25,065
We can't seem to locate him
just at the moment,

903
01:24:25,152 --> 01:24:27,203
but I will pass on
your personal congratulations

904
01:24:27,296 --> 01:24:29,512
on another mission accomplished.

905
01:24:29,600 --> 01:24:30,888
Thank you.

906
01:24:50,337 --> 01:24:53,697
I hate to interrupt, but we have
a situation developing in Syria.

907
01:24:53,793 --> 01:24:56,455
I need you back in
the control room immediately.

908
01:24:58,752 --> 01:25:00,225
Yes, sir.
