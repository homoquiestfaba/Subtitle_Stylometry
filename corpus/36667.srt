1
00:01:53,329 --> 00:01:57,060
As you all know,
by the next time we meet...

2
00:01:58,001 --> 00:02:01,493
this angel is going
to be my wife.

3
00:02:06,776 --> 00:02:12,442
But don't let this distract you.
Our work is not done.

4
00:02:12,982 --> 00:02:14,950
Where are we today?

5
00:02:15,118 --> 00:02:19,452
Kids are killing each other
in school playgrounds.

6
00:02:19,823 --> 00:02:24,760
Half nude women are on every
billboard and magazine cover.

7
00:02:25,094 --> 00:02:28,757
Songs have more dirty words
than clean.

8
00:02:28,932 --> 00:02:32,129
And yet I'm the one
they call crazy.

9
00:02:32,635 --> 00:02:36,662
They don't know anything.
Do you know what I say?

10
00:02:37,006 --> 00:02:40,669
Drop the pills and smokes
and come up for air.

11
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:45,480
We haven't exceeded our
humanity, we've destroyed it.

12
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:51,417
Let me remind you, children,
that God burned Sodom.

13
00:02:51,855 --> 00:02:53,846
He burned Gomorra.

14
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:58,026
If the world doesn't want to
listen to what I have to say...

15
00:02:58,661 --> 00:03:02,256
then we're headed straight back
into the fire, all of us.

16
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:09,095
So long as you all follow me,
not us.

17
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:56,743
There are few places left where
you can still see the stars.

18
00:03:57,086 --> 00:03:59,611
Is this what you
wanted to show me?

19
00:03:59,789 --> 00:04:03,486
Would that be enough?
.Yes, of course.

20
00:04:04,527 --> 00:04:09,294
Sorry, Maxwell. You're trying to
teach me and I'm missing it.

21
00:04:09,532 --> 00:04:13,024
That's not it.
That's it.

22
00:04:13,202 --> 00:04:16,000
An engagement present
from me to you.

23
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:17,799
Are you serious?

24
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:25,376
That's incredible! I've always
wanted to take a cruise.

25
00:04:25,748 --> 00:04:27,739
I wanted to surprise you.

26
00:04:29,218 --> 00:04:31,277
I've made a decision, Trace.

27
00:04:31,721 --> 00:04:34,519
It's timewe all got to know
the power of our crusade.

28
00:04:47,403 --> 00:04:49,132
Oh, God!

29
00:04:55,812 --> 00:04:57,746
It's no coincidence.

30
00:04:59,649 --> 00:05:02,174
What's the matter?
You're shaking.

31
00:05:02,518 --> 00:05:06,784
You're insane.
You are insane!

32
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:23,002
You misunderstood me.

33
00:05:34,951 --> 00:05:38,944
Always playing games.

34
00:05:43,092 --> 00:05:44,889
Where are you?

35
00:05:51,067 --> 00:05:54,559
No one runs out on me.
You know that.

36
00:06:01,144 --> 00:06:04,841
I'll find you.
Where could you possibly go?

37
00:06:33,843 --> 00:06:35,276
Come on!

38
00:06:50,059 --> 00:06:52,254
Nobody betrays me.

39
00:07:48,851 --> 00:07:51,843
Remember, you're llstening to
Hot Vegas 102.

40
00:07:52,021 --> 00:07:55,513
Hlgh tomorrow, 107,
2 degrees hotter than today.

41
00:08:38,401 --> 00:08:41,893
How could you possibly
get arrested, it's legal here.

 42
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:46,101
Good win, freeze to that chair.

43
00:08:52,515 --> 00:08:55,040
Do you want to tell me
what the hell these are?

44
00:08:55,218 --> 00:08:57,152
Looks like atack
of case reports.

45
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:01,416
They 're yours, wise ass, late
and filled out incorrectly.

46
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:03,983
They 're all solved, aren't they?

47
00:09:04,594 --> 00:09:08,189
God damn you!
This city isn't your playground.

48
00:09:08,364 --> 00:09:10,730
I'm not your nursemaid to
watch after you...

49
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:13,664
so you will fill out
these reports correctly.

50
00:09:13,836 --> 00:09:15,497
You will get back
on the street...

51
00:09:15,671 --> 00:09:20,131
and remember you're a cop,
not a one man disaster area.

52
00:09:21,844 --> 00:09:23,903
Get a hair cut.

53
00:09:25,081 --> 00:09:26,810
Morning, chief.

54
00:09:30,419 --> 00:09:31,977
Where's the fun in this?

55
00:09:32,588 --> 00:09:35,557
.Morning, chief.
.Morning.

56
00:09:38,961 --> 00:09:42,294
.Will you marry me?
.Very funny, uncle Roger.

57
00:09:42,531 --> 00:09:45,625
Come here. Sit down.
Tell me where your dad is.

58
00:09:45,901 --> 00:09:52,067
Let me guess, he's sick so he
sent you here to be my partner?

59
00:09:52,275 --> 00:09:55,642
.He called my mum again.
.I thought he said he wouldn't.

60
00:09:55,811 --> 00:09:58,177
Why?
Due to the restraining order?

61
00:09:58,347 --> 00:10:00,645
You know Dad can't get enough
of a bad thing.

62
00:10:00,816 --> 00:10:05,378
He wanted to get back together.
She wanted him to go to hell.

63
00:10:05,621 --> 00:10:07,111
I'm sorry.

64
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:12,694
.I know he's out drinking.
.Everything will be okay.

65
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:16,855
.I promise.
.Yeah, you and everyone else.

66
00:11:00,109 --> 00:11:02,407
Hi, could l just get a water?

67
00:11:02,778 --> 00:11:04,177
Thanks.

68
00:11:08,184 --> 00:11:13,212
I'm at the Sands of Time hotel.
You won't believe what's here.

69
00:11:14,724 --> 00:11:17,591
I'll keep an eye on her
until you get here.

70
00:11:47,356 --> 00:11:49,722
.Can I get you anything?
.No, thanks.

71
00:11:50,493 --> 00:11:52,188
Oh, Christ.

72
00:11:52,361 --> 00:11:54,727
.You can't do this, Kenny.
.I know.

73
00:11:55,698 --> 00:11:58,360
Our shift started 2 hours ago,
so you're on my time.

74
00:11:58,567 --> 00:12:02,628
I've got the bad attitude and
you're the stable one, remember?

75
00:12:03,472 --> 00:12:07,306
It's just one drink, I swear.
I lost track of time.

76
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:16,941
.I called Donna again.
.Your daughter told me.

77
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:20,545
She came to the station
looking for you.

78
00:12:20,723 --> 00:12:24,159
She's a tough kid,
but she needs a father.

79
00:12:24,326 --> 00:12:26,556
And I need apartner
so the deal is this...

80
00:12:26,729 --> 00:12:29,197
Either you stop this or lose
two more people from your life.

81
00:12:29,365 --> 00:12:32,061
I'm gonna. I swear.
 
82
00:12:40,209 --> 00:12:42,404
.Let's go.
.Hang on.

83
00:12:46,482 --> 00:12:49,713
.Are we working or not?
.We're working right now.

84
00:12:53,923 --> 00:12:57,450
L.V. Police department.
Can we have a word with you?

85
00:13:08,404 --> 00:13:09,564
.Come here.
.Stop.

86
00:13:09,738 --> 00:13:11,899
It's okay, I'm apolice officer.
Are you okay?

87
00:13:12,074 --> 00:13:14,440
.What's going on?
.A typical night in Vegas.

88
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:17,071
.What's your name?
.Tracy.

89
00:13:17,246 --> 00:13:21,876
Call 911, tell them where we
are and that shots were fired.

90
00:13:22,184 --> 00:13:24,049
Have them send an ambulance.

91
00:13:26,288 --> 00:13:28,552
Can't wait until the chief
hears about this.

92
00:13:36,966 --> 00:13:38,399
My God!

93
00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:50,040
.Let's go.
.Get out of the way.

94
00:13:55,451 --> 00:13:57,715
Get out of here.

95
00:14:10,232 --> 00:14:12,097
Somebody help me!

96
00:14:37,092 --> 00:14:38,821
Get out of here.

97
00:14:42,031 --> 00:14:43,931
Are you crazy?

98
00:14:47,036 --> 00:14:48,765
You're crazy!

99
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:03,606
This is Det.
Roger Goodwin.

100
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:07,205
This is Det.
Roger Goodwin.

101
00:16:08,517 --> 00:16:12,180
Currently travelling north bound
pursuing hotel shooting suspect.

102
00:16:12,354 --> 00:16:16,586
This suspect is now driving
an L. V. P. D. Cruiser.

103
00:16:16,925 --> 00:16:18,859
What's going on?

104
00:16:21,864 --> 00:16:23,593
Chief, what a surprise.

105
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:27,725
I told you to
stay out of trouble.

106
00:16:28,937 --> 00:16:31,565
Trouble seems to find me
wherever I go.

107
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:33,765
Hold on.

108
00:16:35,644 --> 00:16:37,339
Don't cut me off.

109
00:17:55,357 --> 00:17:57,188
Nice parking.

110
00:17:57,826 --> 00:17:59,760
I'll tell Hacket you did it.

111
00:18:15,911 --> 00:18:17,469
Get everyone ready.

112
00:18:23,585 --> 00:18:26,145
He'd better not be
wasting my time.

113
00:18:26,722 --> 00:18:28,656
Still no answer.

114
00:18:30,993 --> 00:18:33,291
.Thank you.
.Thank you.

115
00:18:33,762 --> 00:18:39,496
Welcome to the Sands of Time
Hotel. How may I help you?

116
00:18:39,668 --> 00:18:44,071
I'm looking for a guest here.
Her name is Tracy Cantra.

117
00:18:44,273 --> 00:18:45,934
With pleasure.

118
00:18:46,842 --> 00:18:51,108
.No one here by that name.
.Are you sure?

119
00:18:55,184 --> 00:18:57,277
Yes, Sir. I am.

120
00:19:03,926 --> 00:19:05,894
Well, well...

121
00:19:08,597 --> 00:19:12,624
My angel appears
to have lost her wings.

122
00:19:13,602 --> 00:19:15,832
.You've got a visitor.
.Here?

123
00:19:16,004 --> 00:19:19,735
Says you have something of his.
Wouldn't take no for an answer.

124
00:19:19,908 --> 00:19:21,705
Excuse me.

125
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:25,736
I expected this to be
much bigger.

126
00:19:26,548 --> 00:19:30,143
We never formally met.
Det. Goodwin, Metro division.

127
00:19:30,719 --> 00:19:34,951
.I'm surprised to see you again.
.I've got more lives than a cat.

128
00:19:35,357 --> 00:19:39,589
But not the guy we were chasing.
What you reap, what you sow.

129
00:19:39,928 --> 00:19:41,452
I guess you do.

130
00:19:41,697 --> 00:19:44,131
This must be what
you came for.

131
00:19:44,299 --> 00:19:47,029
Thanks, for everything.
You were great there.

132
00:19:47,236 --> 00:19:48,760
No big deal.

133
00:19:48,937 --> 00:19:52,805
I don't want to be rude but
I have to finish getting ready.

134
00:19:53,141 --> 00:19:55,575
Sure.

135
00:19:57,546 --> 00:20:02,176
.Good luck, detective.
.You too. Break a leg.

136
00:20:02,584 --> 00:20:04,643
Can I have your phone number?

137
00:20:06,688 --> 00:20:09,122
I might need a statement.

138
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:13,022
I wouldn't have much to say.
I only saw the floor...

139
00:20:13,195 --> 00:20:17,655
and I heard some shots
and I dialed 911, like you said.

140
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:23,029
.I may need to get hold of you.
.I'm sorry.

141
00:20:23,705 --> 00:20:28,472
I don't give out my home number.
You can reach me here.

142
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:33,238
If you don't mind,
I have to finish getting ready.

143
00:20:33,548 --> 00:20:35,482
See you around.

144
00:20:46,395 --> 00:20:49,660
I wasn't drinking. I was taking
care of some business.

145
00:20:49,898 --> 00:20:52,958
Remember what I told you
about lying.

146
00:20:53,135 --> 00:20:55,660
Aren't I supposed to be telling
you about that stuff?

147
00:20:55,938 --> 00:21:00,204
Along with 1OO other
things I'm learning on my own.

148
00:21:00,375 --> 00:21:05,074
I'll be home tomorrow and we'll
spend some time together.

149
00:21:05,247 --> 00:21:07,807
.Drink, Sir?
.No thanks.

150
00:21:07,983 --> 00:21:11,214
.What was that, Dad?
.Here's Roger, I've got to go.

151
00:21:11,386 --> 00:21:16,016
- Let me talk to him.
.I love you, I gotta go.

152
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:20,055
.Dad?
.Everything all right?

153
00:21:21,797 --> 00:21:24,561
.How's the show girl?
.Weird.

154
00:21:24,733 --> 00:21:26,724
Weird like sexual weird?

155
00:21:27,202 --> 00:21:31,263
Weird as in we need to hang out
here a little longer.

156
00:21:31,606 --> 00:21:33,096
Come on.

157
00:21:40,082 --> 00:21:42,141
Hello.
Can I help you?

158
00:21:42,317 --> 00:21:45,514
.Where am I calling?
-The Sandsof Time Hotel.

159
00:21:45,687 --> 00:21:47,348
.Thanks.
-You're welcome.

160
00:23:06,034 --> 00:23:07,729
You know what I think?

161
00:23:08,036 --> 00:23:11,528
That Roger's got a crush
on the show girl.

162
00:23:13,308 --> 00:23:15,139
Maybe.

163
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:19,239
I'm telling you:
she's hiding something.

164
00:23:19,414 --> 00:23:21,848
She had a look on her face like
a wall going up.

165
00:23:22,951 --> 00:23:26,546
She seemed to shut down when
I mentioned the shooter.

166
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:30,158
Cocktail, sir?

167
00:23:30,992 --> 00:23:34,655
.I'm gonna hit the bathroom.
.Don't even think about it.

168
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:01,678
Now.

169
00:25:29,544 --> 00:25:31,102
Everybody out.

170
00:25:36,651 --> 00:25:39,518
Get down. Come on.

171
00:26:11,419 --> 00:26:13,114
Everybody out!

172
00:26:24,065 --> 00:26:25,692
Get out of here.

173
00:26:29,237 --> 00:26:31,034
Come on, move.

174
00:27:02,904 --> 00:27:04,895
Move it. Let's go.

175
00:27:32,167 --> 00:27:33,896
Move out.

176
00:27:36,137 --> 00:27:37,468
Now.

177
00:28:10,038 --> 00:28:11,403
Run.

178
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:15,466
It's chaos out here.
Requesting multiple back up.

179
00:29:15,637 --> 00:29:19,767
Multiple back up.
We need everything you've got.

180
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:43,756
.Rise and shine.
.Is that you, Rog?

181
00:29:44,499 --> 00:29:46,558
Come on, man.

182
00:29:48,903 --> 00:29:51,497
I've got you.

183
00:30:06,354 --> 00:30:07,719
Let's get out of here.

184
00:30:09,824 --> 00:30:11,314
Run.

185
00:30:17,765 --> 00:30:21,701
Chief's right.
You're a walking disaster.

186
00:30:33,314 --> 00:30:34,804
Listen up.

187
00:30:34,983 --> 00:30:38,680
Iwant to know who these
people are and who they're with.

188
00:30:38,853 --> 00:30:42,914
And how they got into
that building. Lets move!

189
00:30:44,125 --> 00:30:45,558
Who's she?

190
00:30:45,727 --> 00:30:49,288
She's with the hotel show.
She says one of the guy 's got away.

191
00:30:49,464 --> 00:30:51,898
Tracy, her cop friend
and his partner.

192
00:30:52,066 --> 00:30:53,499
What cop friend?

193
00:30:53,668 --> 00:30:57,468
Good looking guy. He said
his name was Roger something.

194
00:30:57,639 --> 00:31:00,369
You gotta be kidding.
Get her out of here.

195
00:31:00,542 --> 00:31:01,941
Chief.

196
00:31:02,677 --> 00:31:06,044
Chief Hacket, L. V. P. D.
Who am I speaking to?

197
00:31:06,614 --> 00:31:09,481
All you need to know
is I'm in control.

198
00:31:10,184 --> 00:31:13,779
The hotel is completely sealed.
There's no way in or out.

199
00:31:13,955 --> 00:31:16,515
I have hostages l won't
hesitate to kill.

200
00:31:16,691 --> 00:31:20,559
To assume my powers are limited
is to make a big mistake.

201
00:31:21,262 --> 00:31:25,164
Okay, I've got the message.
What exactly do you want?

202
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:28,031
Time and breathing room.

203
00:31:28,202 --> 00:31:31,638
When I'm done I'll leave
this town far behind.

204
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:34,033
And what if I say no?

205
00:31:34,208 --> 00:31:37,006
I'll show you which part
of no you don't understand.

206
00:31:46,387 --> 00:31:48,321
Take cover.

207
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:03,433
.Any sign of her yet?
.Nothing yet.

208
00:32:08,376 --> 00:32:10,344
I'm shutting the place down.

209
00:32:32,166 --> 00:32:35,033
They 've sealed the entrance.
We can't get in or out.

210
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:36,898
The front entrance's blown out.

211
00:32:45,179 --> 00:32:48,376
Everybody out.
Move, move.

212
00:32:51,252 --> 00:32:53,652
She's not to leave
this building, understand?

213
00:32:53,821 --> 00:32:57,052
Anyone trying to help her escape
l want dead.

214
00:33:04,866 --> 00:33:06,595
It's this way.

215
00:33:09,904 --> 00:33:11,428
Hello.

216
00:33:12,173 --> 00:33:13,470
No signal.

217
00:33:13,641 --> 00:33:15,370
.What is it?
.C4.

218
00:33:21,382 --> 00:33:23,316
Let's see what's behind door 2.

219
00:33:26,587 --> 00:33:29,613
What's going on around here?

220
00:33:30,458 --> 00:33:33,120
Everyone's been through
and there's still no sign of her.

221
00:33:33,628 --> 00:33:35,755
She's still in the building.

222
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:42,600
Gamer, what do you have?

223
00:33:44,806 --> 00:33:49,300
A bunch of empty rooms but that
only covers 3O% of the hotel.

224
00:33:49,477 --> 00:33:52,708
The other 7O% is about
3 million square feet.

225
00:33:53,147 --> 00:33:55,672
If she's out there, it could
take days to find her.

226
00:33:56,384 --> 00:33:58,113
We don't have days.

227
00:34:09,430 --> 00:34:10,954
What was that?

228
00:34:11,132 --> 00:34:13,657
Some of the bombs
were set on timers.

229
00:34:13,835 --> 00:34:15,393
You told us to.

230
00:34:15,570 --> 00:34:17,231
We were supposed to be
out of here by now.

231
00:34:17,405 --> 00:34:19,373
Of course we were.

232
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:21,701
It was a simple operation.

233
00:34:26,581 --> 00:34:30,415
I put my trust in you people
and you failed.

234
00:34:31,986 --> 00:34:35,387
Are you incapable of carrying
out my vision?

235
00:34:35,556 --> 00:34:37,114
No, Maxwell.

236
00:34:39,127 --> 00:34:42,028
.We'll find her.
.That's right, we will.

237
00:34:42,196 --> 00:34:47,930
Over my dead body and yours,
I'm not leaving without her.

238
00:34:51,672 --> 00:34:53,833
Find her.

239
00:34:56,043 --> 00:34:58,910
Ricky, we've had
a change of plans.

240
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:00,775
What's your status?

241
00:35:00,948 --> 00:35:03,678
Almost done.
It's gonna be beautiful.

242
00:35:04,452 --> 00:35:08,252
Good, someone I can count
on in this organization.

243
00:35:08,856 --> 00:35:12,986
Listen carefully.
I need you to do one more thing.

244
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:42,417
All units,
this is the chlef speaking.

245
00:35:42,623 --> 00:35:46,252
We have a full scale alert
at the Sandsof Time hotel.

246
00:35:50,031 --> 00:35:55,435
Repeat, a full scale alert.
I mon route, E. T.A. 10 mins.

247
00:35:55,736 --> 00:35:59,832
Have all emergency units
on stand by to receive.

248
00:36:00,007 --> 00:36:02,567
We've got a full
scale tactical alert.

249
00:36:02,877 --> 00:36:06,335
Swat team, fire fighters,
all avaliable police cruisers...

250
00:36:06,514 --> 00:36:08,448
to the Sandsof Time hotel.

251
00:36:10,484 --> 00:36:13,885
The structure is burning.
Hostages have been taken.

252
00:36:14,055 --> 00:36:18,549
The structure is burning
and there are people inside.

253
00:36:23,531 --> 00:36:25,260
Damn, Kenny.

254
00:36:26,901 --> 00:36:30,894
.That was good bourbon.
.Good time to stop drinking.

255
00:36:31,172 --> 00:36:34,141
.I'd like to die with a smile.
.We're not dying down here.

256
00:36:34,308 --> 00:36:37,869
Kenny 's right. It's over.
There's noway out.

257
00:36:39,647 --> 00:36:41,478
You too...

258
00:36:42,183 --> 00:36:43,582
Fine.

259
00:36:43,985 --> 00:36:47,443
Then if we're all about to die,
why don't you tell us why?

260
00:37:03,304 --> 00:37:05,238
How would I know
any more than you?

261
00:37:05,406 --> 00:37:09,467
You were running from the first
shot so drop the act.

262
00:37:09,677 --> 00:37:11,474
Who are these cowboys?

263
00:37:13,447 --> 00:37:17,349
They 're not cowboys
and they 're not robbers.

264
00:37:17,919 --> 00:37:19,853
Not even terrorists.

265
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:26,751
They 're his personal army
sworn to his holy war...

266
00:37:26,928 --> 00:37:30,364
convinced that they 're
saviors of the modern world.

267
00:37:30,765 --> 00:37:34,201
They 'll do anything he says.
They 'll die for him.

268
00:37:35,369 --> 00:37:39,499
.The guy on the dance floor.
.Yes, Maxwell.

269
00:37:40,308 --> 00:37:42,299
How do you know all this?

270
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:48,410
Because I used
to be one of them.

271
00:37:51,018 --> 00:37:54,818
Great! This is getting
better and better.

272
00:37:55,423 --> 00:37:58,722
All emergency police and fire
units are responding.

273
00:37:59,327 --> 00:38:02,353
The structure is burning
and hostages have been taken.

274
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:05,294
I repeat.
Hostages have been taken.

275
00:38:14,075 --> 00:38:16,168
This isn't the first time.

276
00:38:16,344 --> 00:38:19,313
Two years ago he blew up
a ship in San Pedro.

277
00:38:20,982 --> 00:38:24,440
I remember, they never found
out who was responsible.

278
00:38:24,785 --> 00:38:28,744
Did it ever occur to you to
tell somebody? Like the cops.

279
00:38:28,923 --> 00:38:32,518
.Sowe wouldn't end up here.
.I was running for my life.

280
00:38:32,693 --> 00:38:36,720
The cops couldn't catch him
or protect me, I had no choice.

281
00:38:38,666 --> 00:38:42,602
I should have known he'd come
back for me. We were engaged.

282
00:38:45,206 --> 00:38:47,766
Well, that just takes the cake.

283
00:38:49,010 --> 00:38:51,103
No wonder I couldn't get
your phone number.

284
00:38:51,278 --> 00:38:53,769
Your ex-boyfriend's
the Messiah.

285
00:38:54,215 --> 00:38:59,448
It was Jo Lewis who said "you
can run but you can't hide".

286
00:39:01,255 --> 00:39:03,519
He was talking about
another fighter.

287
00:39:03,691 --> 00:39:07,855
It took 12 rounds, but he beat
the other fighter to a pulp.

288
00:39:10,297 --> 00:39:14,233
His opponent didn't have the
opportunity I'm giving you.

289
00:39:15,369 --> 00:39:17,667
I'm the only
way out of here.

290
00:39:17,838 --> 00:39:20,500
And your last chance
to turn your life around.

291
00:39:22,943 --> 00:39:27,573
Look at the people next to you.
They 're agents of the devil.

292
00:39:28,215 --> 00:39:31,707
The lies they tell you
will damn them forever.

293
00:39:31,952 --> 00:39:37,515
This is no freedom trail,
just a slow way to kill yourself.

294
00:39:38,359 --> 00:39:41,726
Which if you ask me is truly
the greatest sin of all.

295
00:39:44,565 --> 00:39:46,260
There's still time.

296
00:39:47,501 --> 00:39:50,368
The world I promised you
still exists.

297
00:39:51,172 --> 00:39:53,766
You just have to let
me take you there.

298
00:39:54,942 --> 00:39:56,773
I love you, Tracy.

299
00:39:58,546 --> 00:40:00,411
I'll see you real soon.

300
00:40:01,148 --> 00:40:04,481
Alf a team, I can see the hotel.

301
00:40:10,958 --> 00:40:13,950
Set up a perimeter on
the South West quadrant.

302
00:40:14,128 --> 00:40:15,720
Copy that.

303
00:40:23,137 --> 00:40:27,005
Bravo team, I have touchdown.
Commence sweep.

304
00:40:31,779 --> 00:40:35,408
I need two guys round the back
and four guys round the front.

305
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:38,284
Keep it hot.

306
00:41:05,746 --> 00:41:07,873
Who does he think he is?
Moses?

307
00:41:09,450 --> 00:41:15,787
And Jesus, and Manson,
and Hitler all rolled into one.

308
00:41:16,123 --> 00:41:21,254
If he thinks we're gonna wait
for him to exterminate us...

309
00:41:21,929 --> 00:41:24,295
he's not the prophet
he thinks he is.

310
00:41:24,465 --> 00:41:27,628
All he wants is me.
I can end this right now.

311
00:41:27,935 --> 00:41:30,733
Oh no, you don't.
You're under arrest.

312
00:41:40,281 --> 00:41:44,479
For accessory to that and
whatever else he does tonight.

313
00:41:44,952 --> 00:41:46,715
We're taking you out of here.

314
00:41:47,288 --> 00:41:49,916
Then we're taking him down.
Let's go.

315
00:41:50,457 --> 00:41:53,790
We've covered the basement.
There's no way out down here.

316
00:41:54,228 --> 00:41:58,665
.Then we'll move upstairs.
.Cameras, he'd spot us.

317
00:41:59,233 --> 00:42:01,098
Not if he can't see.

318
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:08,800
Like it or not,
you're stuck with me.

319
00:42:13,814 --> 00:42:17,113
This is Bravo division
repeating alert.

320
00:42:17,284 --> 00:42:19,343
Squad leader, this is the chief.

321
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:24,116
S. W. entrance is secured.
N. W. entrance is still on hold.

322
00:42:24,291 --> 00:42:30,423
Leader has entered the building.
Tangos have been spotted.

323
00:42:30,598 --> 00:42:32,395
Ten, four.

324
00:43:47,308 --> 00:43:49,333
Tell me this isn't happening.

325
00:43:49,777 --> 00:43:52,905
Gamer, l want you
to tell me this isn't happening.

326
00:43:56,450 --> 00:43:59,010
I'm sorry, the whole
building is down.

327
00:43:59,186 --> 00:44:04,419
.Well, bring it up.
.It's gone off in the basement.

328
00:44:04,591 --> 00:44:07,287
Not gone off.
Cut off.

329
00:44:07,494 --> 00:44:13,023
Everyone to the basement
and don't let her get away.

330
00:44:54,007 --> 00:44:56,032
Looking for me?

331
00:45:02,216 --> 00:45:03,683
Come on.

332
00:45:11,225 --> 00:45:14,592
We're playing by the rules.
Just how much time do you need?

333
00:45:15,329 --> 00:45:17,354
Sorry to disappoint you.

334
00:45:18,499 --> 00:45:21,366
Why are you always in the
middle of this crap?

335
00:45:21,535 --> 00:45:23,400
What'd you do to this guy?

336
00:45:23,904 --> 00:45:27,431
I've got something he wants.
Have you spoken to Maxwell?

337
00:45:27,674 --> 00:45:30,575
.Is that the psycho's name?
.More on that later.

338
00:45:30,744 --> 00:45:34,441
Take what he says to be true.
This whole place is wired.

339
00:45:34,615 --> 00:45:39,143
We've dodged his bombs. I hope
you've got away out of here.

340
00:45:39,319 --> 00:45:42,777
We've almost cleared a service
exit on the S. E. corner.

341
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:46,790
I was gonna send the SWAT team,
but If you can make it...

342
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:49,121
I'll pump the place with gas
and choke them.

343
00:45:49,296 --> 00:45:52,663
.Fine. Wait for us.
- Don't take too long.

344
00:45:54,234 --> 00:45:58,068
.We'll see you on the outside.
.Roger that.

345
00:45:58,572 --> 00:46:02,702
By the time Maxwell realizes
we're gone...

346
00:46:02,876 --> 00:46:05,106
.he'll be sucking teargas fumes.
.What about her?

347
00:46:06,713 --> 00:46:09,113
Jenna.
Oh, my God.

348
00:46:09,950 --> 00:46:11,474
What's she doing here?

349
00:46:11,652 --> 00:46:13,711
She was at home.
I said I'd call her tomorrow.

350
00:46:13,887 --> 00:46:16,355
.Not soon enough.
.Do you know this girl?

351
00:46:19,126 --> 00:46:20,957
.She's my daughter.
.This is Roger.

352
00:46:21,128 --> 00:46:23,426
I can see you.
Just stay where you are.

353
00:46:24,431 --> 00:46:27,525
Honey, everything's okay.
Just sit tight.

354
00:46:29,736 --> 00:46:31,829
Gamer, what is going
on up there?

355
00:46:37,878 --> 00:46:40,745
We need Maxwell here.
Then we get her and go.

356
00:46:42,316 --> 00:46:44,978
Mr. Gamer can't come to phone
now, leave a message.

357
00:46:46,653 --> 00:46:51,613
Well, what do you know.
You must be the Prince Charming.

358
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:57,258
I'm just doing my job. You're the
one living in a fantasy world.

359
00:46:58,298 --> 00:47:03,099
But when I've erased all the
ignorant sinners like you...

360
00:47:03,537 --> 00:47:06,870
my world will be the only one
standing.

361
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:11,773
As soon as you realize,
you'll do yourself a favor.

362
00:47:12,412 --> 00:47:14,380
Hand the girl over.

363
00:47:15,249 --> 00:47:20,186
You bring up some interesting
points but I'm gonna keep her.

364
00:47:21,655 --> 00:47:24,317
Jenna,
stay right there.

365
00:47:33,934 --> 00:47:36,027
What do you know about these?

366
00:47:39,673 --> 00:47:41,402
Everything.

367
00:48:15,709 --> 00:48:17,233
Don't.

368
00:48:23,550 --> 00:48:25,518
It was one of ours.

369
00:48:36,830 --> 00:48:38,457
And that?

370
00:48:41,535 --> 00:48:44,333
.One of theirs.
.Come on.

371
00:49:14,134 --> 00:49:15,726
There.

372
00:49:17,237 --> 00:49:19,068
Honey.

373
00:49:20,674 --> 00:49:24,974
.Don't you hang up on me again.
.I can explain everything.

374
00:49:29,516 --> 00:49:31,711
You seem like a smart guy.

375
00:49:32,085 --> 00:49:36,021
But you're out numbered and
running out of real estate.

376
00:49:36,189 --> 00:49:37,679
Guys, can we do this later?

377
00:49:53,540 --> 00:49:54,802
Dad!

378
00:50:00,614 --> 00:50:02,479
.Come on.
.Come on.

379
00:50:03,583 --> 00:50:05,141
Go, go.

380
00:50:06,219 --> 00:50:07,914
Come here.

381
00:50:17,664 --> 00:50:20,428
Iwas never really
good at Math. Let's go.

382
00:50:21,268 --> 00:50:22,997
Come on, let's go.

383
00:50:44,224 --> 00:50:46,556
Take this for me.
Thanks.

384
00:50:46,893 --> 00:50:49,327
.Where are you?
.I ran into a road block.

385
00:50:49,496 --> 00:50:51,726
Several, actually.
Kenny's daughter'swith us.

386
00:50:51,898 --> 00:50:53,798
-What?
.It's a long story.

387
00:50:53,967 --> 00:50:57,767
.We're not gonna make it to you.
.I knew you'd say that.

388
00:50:57,938 --> 00:51:01,965
Team's on the way. We'll pick
you up at the front entrance.

389
00:51:02,342 --> 00:51:06,574
There's a ventilation shaft
to the roof in the ballroom.

390
00:51:06,847 --> 00:51:10,681
It's probably not booby trapped.
Chopper us out from there.

391
00:51:10,884 --> 00:51:13,785
I said meet up with
S.W.A.T. team.

392
00:51:13,954 --> 00:51:17,947
- I ca n get us out of here.
.God damn it, that's an order.

393
00:51:18,391 --> 00:51:22,953
And I expect you to follow it.
Now move out.

394
00:51:25,499 --> 00:51:26,989
Quit whining.

395
00:51:27,734 --> 00:51:31,568
.Isn't sorry enough?
.Talk is cheap, Dad.

396
00:51:32,439 --> 00:51:34,566
.Hey!
.Sorry.

397
00:51:35,242 --> 00:51:37,073
This way. Come on.

398
00:51:39,412 --> 00:51:40,970
Let's go.

399
00:51:50,157 --> 00:51:52,955
How many lives do you
have to ruin, Tracy?

400
00:51:53,126 --> 00:51:56,254
You walk out with me
and everyone lives.

401
00:52:07,974 --> 00:52:11,501
No disrespect, but is she
worth all this?

402
00:52:16,917 --> 00:52:18,976
Loosing faith in my direction?

403
00:52:19,452 --> 00:52:23,821
 .No ljust mean...
.Maybewe don't need her.

404
00:52:25,525 --> 00:52:30,724
Maybe we don't need you.
Mention her again and I swear...

405
00:52:39,940 --> 00:52:41,532
Come on.

406
00:52:43,210 --> 00:52:46,839
Tracy, listen to me carefully.

407
00:52:47,147 --> 00:52:50,446
I want you here now.

408
00:52:53,587 --> 00:52:57,421
.Were you really engaged to him?
.I was young and he talk swell.

409
00:52:58,658 --> 00:53:00,683
We were gonna
change the world.

410
00:53:02,128 --> 00:53:05,689
.How did you end up in Vegas?
.It's the last place he'd look.

411
00:53:06,833 --> 00:53:10,929
I could always sing.
Learn a few dance moves.

412
00:53:11,104 --> 00:53:12,662
Show girl Tracy.

413
00:53:14,341 --> 00:53:16,309
You could have picked Paris.

414
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:22,940
Meet any threat with
extreme prejudice.

415
00:53:23,116 --> 00:53:26,313
-Rendez vous level.
-Affirmative.

416
00:54:11,665 --> 00:54:14,930
.What's going on up there?
.We're taking fire.

417
00:54:33,887 --> 00:54:36,219
Get up!
Let's go out of here.

418
00:55:01,214 --> 00:55:04,980
It appears someone didn't pay
attention to my instructions.

419
00:55:31,077 --> 00:55:33,705
Bravo, this is team leader.
Do you read me?

420
00:55:35,181 --> 00:55:37,775
Bravo squad,
do you read me?

421
00:55:39,419 --> 00:55:41,819
Talk to me.
What's going on there?

422
00:55:43,723 --> 00:55:45,315
Talk to me.

423
00:55:51,531 --> 00:55:55,365
.Ricky, the second project.
.Everything's ready to go.

424
00:55:55,535 --> 00:55:57,332
Well done.

425
00:56:07,947 --> 00:56:09,608
Your men are dead.

426
00:56:10,316 --> 00:56:13,285
Did you think you'd get away
with astunt like that?

427
00:56:14,587 --> 00:56:16,111
I gave you my word...

428
00:56:16,289 --> 00:56:20,726
but people don't trust
each other nowadays.

429
00:56:22,195 --> 00:56:26,598
Did you think I'd sit on my ass
and do nothing?

430
00:56:26,966 --> 00:56:31,198
You're a police officer.
In this twisted society...

431
00:56:31,371 --> 00:56:35,705
you get aspecial achievement
award for perverting justice...

432
00:56:35,875 --> 00:56:39,538
and standing in the way
of decent human evolution.

433
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:46,350
In case you showed your true
colors I arranged a backup plan.

434
00:56:46,519 --> 00:56:51,149
.What are you talking about?
.You won't get away with this.

435
00:56:54,094 --> 00:56:59,430
To assume my powers are limited
would be making a big mistake.

436
00:56:59,833 --> 00:57:04,395
I'm gonna teach everybody
in this town another lesson.

437
00:57:10,643 --> 00:57:16,775
The Buddhists say we don't die.
We just cycle around.

438
00:57:17,050 --> 00:57:20,884
Each life leading into the next.
Gathering knowledge.

439
00:57:21,721 --> 00:57:25,213
So for all those
about to passon...

440
00:57:25,425 --> 00:57:27,950
we shouldn't think
of it as an ending.

441
00:57:28,228 --> 00:57:32,289
It's like I'm giving them
a seminar on life.

442
00:58:29,322 --> 00:58:34,487
This is Alrborn 1, suspect has
just blown up the overpass.

443
00:58:34,661 --> 00:58:38,358
Repeat suspect has blown up
the entire overpass.

444
00:58:39,699 --> 00:58:41,667
What's going on out there?

445
00:58:44,204 --> 00:58:47,867
He blew up the overpass.
It's a slaughter house.

446
00:58:48,041 --> 00:58:52,740
.He blew the overpass!
.I'm giving him what he wants.

447
00:58:55,748 --> 00:58:57,682
You don't understand.

448
00:58:59,919 --> 00:59:04,083
This is all because of me.
I won't let anyone get hurt.

449
00:59:04,257 --> 00:59:08,057
If we give in now,
he'll never stop.

450
00:59:08,661 --> 00:59:11,027
Trust me on this.

451
00:59:12,232 --> 00:59:14,029
Let's take one more chance.

452
00:59:19,239 --> 00:59:24,267
.Can you get a helicopter?
.I'm calling the shots not you.

453
00:59:24,611 --> 00:59:29,310
I can get us out of here.
Don't give up on us.

454
00:59:30,516 --> 00:59:32,108
Okay.

455
00:59:32,986 --> 00:59:35,284
Be there and I'll pick you up.

456
00:59:43,563 --> 00:59:46,862
.Are yousure this is the way?
.Positive, right through here.

457
00:59:47,100 --> 00:59:49,295
Everybody be careful.
Eyes open.

458
01:00:03,916 --> 01:00:05,850
Damn, that was close.

459
01:00:07,086 --> 01:00:09,111
.I could use a drink.
.Dad!

460
01:00:09,289 --> 01:00:12,417
He's just kidding.
I think.

461
01:00:21,367 --> 01:00:24,666
Let's get moving!
Back up!

462
01:00:24,904 --> 01:00:27,065
Let's clear the way.
Bring the ambulance in.

463
01:00:30,710 --> 01:00:34,271
Here we go.
We need help on this side.

464
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:36,471
.Where is everybody?
.Coming up right now.

465
01:01:01,908 --> 01:01:03,603
Stop.

466
01:01:10,350 --> 01:01:12,250
This way.

467
01:01:50,323 --> 01:01:52,382
.Chief!
.Over this way.

468
01:01:55,428 --> 01:01:56,861
Get down.

469
01:02:11,611 --> 01:02:14,512
That's the part of"no"
you didn't understand.

470
01:02:38,471 --> 01:02:39,938
Stay here.

471
01:02:42,909 --> 01:02:45,377
She can't kill you.
She won't shoot.

472
01:03:12,305 --> 01:03:15,274
It looks like you're running
out of believers.

473
01:03:15,641 --> 01:03:19,077
Why don't you pack up
the arc and float away?

474
01:03:19,412 --> 01:03:22,848
The flood is coming.
Right now.

475
01:03:31,023 --> 01:03:32,991
Iwon't let you leave, Tracy.

476
01:03:35,862 --> 01:03:37,352
You better believe that.

477
01:03:42,768 --> 01:03:44,668
I'm getting sick of this guy.

478
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:48,839
Run, Maxwell.

479
01:03:49,542 --> 01:03:51,100
Come on, Jenna.

480
01:03:53,045 --> 01:03:54,808
Is he alright?

481
01:03:56,582 --> 01:03:58,447
Is he alright, Roger?

482
01:04:05,024 --> 01:04:06,355
Out.

483
01:04:30,683 --> 01:04:36,622
In all his life time, Van Gogh
only sold one painting.

484
01:04:38,190 --> 01:04:41,990
Galileo was jailed...

485
01:04:42,161 --> 01:04:46,154
for saying that the earth
revolved around the sun.

486
01:04:48,100 --> 01:04:52,537
I don't have to tell you what
they did to Christ.

487
01:04:53,105 --> 01:04:55,869
Why is society
so afraid of greatness?

488
01:04:56,142 --> 01:04:59,077
Why does it turn its back
on the ones it needs the most?

489
01:04:59,245 --> 01:05:04,376
In the end these great men
are always sanctified.

490
01:05:04,550 --> 01:05:06,848
But they always
have to die first.

491
01:05:33,212 --> 01:05:37,114
I've set every bomb
to go off in ten minutes.

492
01:05:37,917 --> 01:05:42,786
That's enough to bring this
place down before you get out.

493
01:05:43,456 --> 01:05:47,916
It's enough time for you to
decide if I get to be a hero...

494
01:05:49,695 --> 01:05:52,357
or do we all go out
as martyrs.

495
01:05:58,037 --> 01:05:59,732
Go!

496
01:06:09,215 --> 01:06:12,082
.We can still get out.
.We'll never make it.

497
01:06:12,251 --> 01:06:15,414
.Kenny, you can disarm it.
.Not in 1O mins.

498
01:06:15,588 --> 01:06:17,954
Let's just wait
for him to kill us.

499
01:06:18,124 --> 01:06:19,887
There is one way.

500
01:06:22,328 --> 01:06:25,354
Turning yourself over
is not the answer.

501
01:06:26,465 --> 01:06:28,057
What if he just thinks I am?

502
01:06:32,471 --> 01:06:35,531
What? Like a trap?

503
01:06:37,910 --> 01:06:39,810
Like one last roll of the dice.

504
01:06:41,747 --> 01:06:43,840
We are in Vegas.

505
01:06:47,253 --> 01:06:49,016
Fine.

506
01:06:53,426 --> 01:06:55,121
Let's go for it.

507
01:07:01,801 --> 01:07:03,530
Okay, how do we do this?

508
01:07:05,971 --> 01:07:07,461
Tracy?

509
01:07:09,308 --> 01:07:10,935
It's me.

510
01:07:12,745 --> 01:07:17,375
Are you willing to take me back
as if my thoughts were your own?

511
01:07:19,485 --> 01:07:21,077
Yes, Maxwell.

512
01:07:23,155 --> 01:07:28,149
.Then come back to me.
.Meet me in the Kings chambers.

513
01:07:30,696 --> 01:07:35,258
.You sure you want to do this?
.More sure than I've ever been.

514
01:07:38,704 --> 01:07:42,697
Keep his attention.
All I need is one good shot.

515
01:07:46,212 --> 01:07:49,010
Listen to me.

516
01:07:49,181 --> 01:07:51,172
You stay right here.
Promise me.

517
01:07:51,350 --> 01:07:53,113
Promise me you'll stay here.

518
01:08:04,396 --> 01:08:07,888
You two continue
to be a thorn in my side.

519
01:08:19,845 --> 01:08:22,905
.What do we have here?
.I'm Jenna.

520
01:08:23,649 --> 01:08:29,417
Jenna's a pretty name.
It's good to have an extra ace.

521
01:08:31,857 --> 01:08:34,883
Tracy, you disappointed me.

522
01:08:36,028 --> 01:08:38,087
What are they doing to you?

523
01:08:43,202 --> 01:08:44,601
Daddy...

524
01:08:45,271 --> 01:08:47,705
-Daddyl
.How did he find her?

525
01:08:49,875 --> 01:08:54,505
.He's gonna get you.
.Be a good girl and come along.

526
01:09:04,957 --> 01:09:07,050
There's nothing to be afraid of.

527
01:09:20,372 --> 01:09:22,340
The King's chamber, Tracy.

528
01:09:39,291 --> 01:09:40,883
You bastard!

529
01:10:23,068 --> 01:10:26,560
Isn't it beautiful
when you can see the light?

530
01:10:27,373 --> 01:10:29,432
Let her go.
I'm coming with you.

531
01:10:29,608 --> 01:10:33,374
The Building is surrounded.
The police are waiting for you.

532
01:10:33,946 --> 01:10:36,710
.And wait they will.
.Are you okay?

533
01:10:36,882 --> 01:10:40,818
We're gonna slip out
right under their noses.

534
01:10:41,954 --> 01:10:43,888
The basement.

535
01:10:51,563 --> 01:10:53,360
I missed you.

536
01:11:02,408 --> 01:11:03,932
Come on.
Let's go.

537
01:11:14,186 --> 01:11:15,813
Are you alright?

538
01:11:19,525 --> 01:11:21,220
Are you okay?

539
01:11:30,402 --> 01:11:32,063
Let's go.

540
01:11:55,094 --> 01:11:56,994
Maxwell, you sick freak!

541
01:12:23,522 --> 01:12:25,513
Let's go! Let's go!

542
01:12:32,064 --> 01:12:33,588
Time to go.

543
01:12:51,550 --> 01:12:55,486
.Damn it! Where is she?
.King's chambers.

544
01:13:24,349 --> 01:13:26,180
Oh, honey.

545
01:13:28,020 --> 01:13:31,922
.Did he hurt you?
.I'm okay, but he took Tracy.

546
01:13:32,091 --> 01:13:36,255
.Where did they go?
.They 're headed to the basement.

547
01:13:36,462 --> 01:13:39,795
He said the hotel is
going to blow.

548
01:13:40,099 --> 01:13:44,763
Not with us in it.
Let's play find the cult leader.

549
01:14:01,186 --> 01:14:03,950
Come on.
Through here.

550
01:14:04,923 --> 01:14:06,322
.What?
.A bomb!

551
01:14:06,492 --> 01:14:12,124
.Leave it for the bomb squad.
.It's motion activated.

552
01:14:17,236 --> 01:14:18,965
Can you do this?

553
01:14:27,079 --> 01:14:28,569
Dad!

554
01:14:29,181 --> 01:14:31,172
Let him go.

555
01:15:04,383 --> 01:15:06,408
We're running out of time.

556
01:16:08,313 --> 01:16:11,578
.Let's go.
.Come on, let's go.

557
01:16:20,525 --> 01:16:22,083
Come on, let's go.

558
01:16:46,551 --> 01:16:48,712
Listen up, everybody.

559
01:16:50,722 --> 01:16:54,590
Today we lost one of the best
cops this city has ever known.

560
01:16:54,760 --> 01:16:58,457
So this city is shut down until
we find the guy who did it.

561
01:16:58,630 --> 01:17:02,532
Nothing moves in the air or on
the ground until Maxwell's ours.

562
01:17:03,302 --> 01:17:05,395
Let's do this, people.

563
01:17:07,906 --> 01:17:11,137
.You okay?
.I'm okay.

564
01:17:17,015 --> 01:17:21,179
This is it, I've done enough
damage for one life time.

565
01:17:23,989 --> 01:17:27,447
I'm glad to hear you
say that.

566
01:17:43,842 --> 01:17:47,073
This is a special
news announcement.

567
01:17:47,412 --> 01:17:50,973
Emergency crews are cleaning up
the Sandsof Time hotel.

568
01:17:51,149 --> 01:17:53,947
Pollce are still looking
for the main suspect...

569
01:17:54,119 --> 01:17:57,316
a radical cult leader
known only as Maxwell.

570
01:17:57,489 --> 01:17:59,514
He is believed to be
in the area.

571
01:17:59,691 --> 01:18:03,821
He's armed and may still have
one of the hostages.

572
01:18:07,999 --> 01:18:10,024
Where are we going?

573
01:18:11,570 --> 01:18:13,162
You'll see.

574
01:18:18,110 --> 01:18:20,977
This is Alrborn 2.
we're tracking a suspect.

575
01:18:21,146 --> 01:18:23,444
Driver and passenger
match the report.

576
01:18:23,615 --> 01:18:27,483
Heading west on 75.

577
01:18:28,220 --> 01:18:30,654
.Shit.
.The Hoover dam.

578
01:18:30,856 --> 01:18:32,881
.I'm going after this guy.
.Your not doing this alone.

579
01:18:33,058 --> 01:18:38,086
Stay here and start
the evacuation.

580
01:18:42,934 --> 01:18:44,731
 Get me the governor's office.

581
01:18:45,270 --> 01:18:47,795
This the L.V.P.D. requesting
a code red.

582
01:18:47,973 --> 01:18:49,565
Evacuation of the dam.

583
01:18:49,741 --> 01:18:53,609
Repeat, this is a code red.
This is not a drill.

584
01:18:54,846 --> 01:19:00,011
Command acknowledges code
red, full evacuation is under way.

585
01:19:00,218 --> 01:19:04,314
The perimeter is sealed off.
All roads are closed.

586
01:19:18,103 --> 01:19:19,661
Up we come.

587
01:19:21,573 --> 01:19:23,564
It's like being
on top of the world.

588
01:19:23,742 --> 01:19:26,643
Please, I'll do
whatever you want.

589
01:19:29,214 --> 01:19:30,841
This way.

590
01:20:08,687 --> 01:20:12,054
Get me as close
to the dam as you can.

591
01:20:15,594 --> 01:20:17,619
2 clicks over this ridge.

592
01:20:20,398 --> 01:20:22,229
Right this way.

593
01:20:27,172 --> 01:20:28,503
Let's go.

594
01:20:41,419 --> 01:20:43,387
There's nothing to be scared of.

595
01:20:43,688 --> 01:20:47,556
I saved you once from yourself
and I can do it again.

596
01:20:47,726 --> 01:20:49,990
As soon as we blow the dam.

597
01:20:52,097 --> 01:20:56,329
You said all you wanted
was for me to come with you.

598
01:20:57,202 --> 01:21:01,536
Purified.
I'm purifying the future.

599
01:21:12,284 --> 01:21:13,876
What'syour status?

600
01:21:14,119 --> 01:21:18,488
The tourists are being evacuated
but no sign of Maxwell.

601
01:21:33,405 --> 01:21:36,806
.Finish up this barricade.
.Let's get this rigged up.

602
01:21:53,625 --> 01:21:55,354
Let's go.

603
01:22:48,913 --> 01:22:51,473
.Oh, man.
.Look what he's doing.

604
01:23:16,675 --> 01:23:20,975
.You don't know when to give up.
.I'm no good at taking orders.

605
01:23:22,714 --> 01:23:25,148
A Greek warrior once said...

606
01:23:27,152 --> 01:23:29,416
Sometimes from the
worst fortune...

607
01:23:30,922 --> 01:23:35,052
you can create a stroke of luck.
That's where you come in.

608
01:23:58,450 --> 01:24:00,918
You make the prize
more worth it.

609
01:24:39,958 --> 01:24:41,619
Are you okay?

610
01:24:41,793 --> 01:24:44,125
Oh my God!
Look.

611
01:24:45,196 --> 01:24:47,664
He's dead.
It's all over.

612
01:24:50,602 --> 01:24:52,433
It's all over.

613
01:24:55,406 --> 01:24:57,135
Come on.

614
01:25:22,233 --> 01:25:24,201
Feel me, Tracy.

615
01:25:36,247 --> 01:25:38,977
.Run.
.Oh, my God!

616
01:27:50,848 --> 01:27:54,545
168 people have perished
In the flood.

617
01:27:54,719 --> 01:27:58,587
But due to the fast action
of Det.McDanlels...

618
01:27:58,756 --> 01:28:00,587
Way to go, hero.

619
01:28:04,896 --> 01:28:08,388
.I can't wait for career day.
.Why is that?

620
01:28:08,566 --> 01:28:12,627
So I can show my dad off
to the whole school.

621
01:28:13,037 --> 01:28:17,337
What's next?
Record aNo. 1hit in L. A?

622
01:28:18,009 --> 01:28:21,638
The only number I'm gonna
record is yours.

623
01:28:21,846 --> 01:28:25,475
Sorry,
I can't give out my home number.

624
01:28:25,917 --> 01:28:27,441
.Really?
.Really.

625
01:28:27,618 --> 01:28:29,381
Give me your hand.

626
01:28:34,058 --> 01:28:35,889
Not here.
