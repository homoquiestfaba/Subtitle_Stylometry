1
00:02:01,412 --> 00:02:03,373
"It has become appallingly obvious

2
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:06,918
that our technology
has exceeded our humanity."

3
00:02:07,001 --> 00:02:08,419
Albert Einstein made
that statement

4
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:10,213
when the steam-powered
locomotive was still

5
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:12,298
a wonder of technology.

6
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:13,842
I wonder what theory
he would have had

7
00:02:13,925 --> 00:02:16,803
for the mess mankind
has made of things now.

8
00:02:21,015 --> 00:02:23,601
Humankind did the best
that it could

9
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:24,936
most of the time,

10
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:27,605
but complacency cost them.

11
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:31,442
The first wave of the drone assault
destroyed them.

12
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:33,611
They never had
a chance to regroup

13
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:35,947
after that first
devastating attack.

14
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,949
They had no reference
for its sheer force.

15
00:02:38,032 --> 00:02:40,410
Mmm, but we really lost the battle

16
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:42,579
before the first shot was fired,

17
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:44,581
didn't we, Tallis?

18
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:46,374
Man does not live in peace.

19
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:00,638
Check stop, Tallis.

20
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:03,308
I'm detecting movement.

21
00:03:03,391 --> 00:03:04,642
1 200 meters.

22
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:06,436
Pulsing to microwave frequency.

23
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:07,854
Rodent. Small size.

24
00:03:07,937 --> 00:03:09,063
Tallis, it's lunch.

25
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:42,889
A disease-free canine.

26
00:03:42,972 --> 00:03:44,849
Good target of opportunity, Tallis.

27
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:46,935
You could eat
smoked dog for a week.

28
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:53,024
You're throwing away our rations.

29
00:03:53,107 --> 00:03:55,109
My rations.

30
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:58,029
This is technically
unsound behavior, Tallis.

31
00:03:58,112 --> 00:04:00,031
A cranium kill at 1 200 meters?

32
00:04:00,114 --> 00:04:03,701
What an extraordinary waste
of advanced nanotechnology.

33
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:06,120
I wasn't engineered for scavenging.

34
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:09,457
Check stop.
Modular surveillance

35
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,042
is reading a low-level
distress beacon.

36
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:12,043
What is it?

37
00:04:12,126 --> 00:04:13,336
Get ready for a walk.

38
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:14,879
We're headed to the old refinery.

39
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:19,425
There's a syntax error.

40
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:21,010
It's pulsing an obsolete version

41
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:23,054
of the modular code
from the crane tower,

42
00:04:23,137 --> 00:04:26,057
broadcasting with
a 700 hopper frequency.

43
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:28,851
Tallis, it could be another operator.

44
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:31,437
We are required to verify.

45
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:33,439
Mmm, no entry, Tallis.

46
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:35,066
This location
is heavily booby-trapped.

47
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:36,067
Composition four,

48
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:37,068
amatol,

49
00:04:37,151 --> 00:04:39,070
and traces of tetrytol.

50
00:04:39,153 --> 00:04:41,072
Special purpose
operator ordnance, Tallis.

51
00:04:41,155 --> 00:04:42,573
Not drone issue.

52
00:04:42,657 --> 00:04:44,909
You'll have to scale
the outside of the building.

53
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:18,985
By the damn dead demon of Socrates,

54
00:05:19,068 --> 00:05:21,612
who's out there?

55
00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:23,114
700th Operator Tallis

56
00:05:23,197 --> 00:05:26,367
and Smart Scope Angel 1 1 020.

57
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:28,202
Please identify yourself.

58
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:31,664
This is Eye Cap Colonel Norton, 1 4507.

59
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:34,042
What in the damnation's
been happening?

60
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:36,210
How long have you been here, Colonel?

61
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:37,879
We blitzed into the Valley of Death

62
00:05:37,962 --> 00:05:39,213
under hellacious incoming fire.

63
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:40,757
God-awful experience.

64
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,801
I guess old Bradley here
lasted about 20 minutes.

65
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:46,137
Saw 'em-- drone police, dogs,

66
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:47,638
gathering up other bodies.

67
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:49,807
They must have missed us
up here, damn their eyes.

68
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:52,018
So much tracer, Pilgrim,
it was biblical.

69
00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:54,729
An apocalypse
in the devil's own den.

70
00:05:54,812 --> 00:05:57,815
Wave after wave ripped
into them with the minigun.

71
00:05:57,899 --> 00:05:59,150
When that was cleaned off,

72
00:05:59,233 --> 00:06:01,152
we fired 30-mil rockets, grenades--

73
00:06:01,235 --> 00:06:02,695
Wave upon wave,

74
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:04,530
like fighting the tide, brother.

75
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:07,325
The drones sprayed
H.E. and phosphorous up here.

76
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:09,160
That blotted the flesh out.

77
00:06:09,243 --> 00:06:10,870
I was useless after that.

78
00:06:10,953 --> 00:06:12,580
I watched helpless as Kurtigan

79
00:06:12,663 --> 00:06:15,666
took three weeks to die
of his gut wound.

80
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,752
It was pretty dark, brother.

81
00:06:17,835 --> 00:06:20,546
Any food?
Ration packs?

82
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,090
Check the ammo case in the corner.

83
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:23,508
Careful.

84
00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:24,842
We rigged the mortar stock.

85
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:26,177
It's on a tumbler.

86
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:28,054
Electronic countermeasure circuit.

87
00:06:28,137 --> 00:06:30,681
There's a disabler below
the claymore clacker unit.

88
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:33,059
Guys, take me.
You gotta take me!

89
00:06:33,142 --> 00:06:34,185
I'm goin' nuts up here!

90
00:06:34,268 --> 00:06:36,854
There's another
30 years on my cell!

91
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:39,190
The minigun's AI system is unstable.

92
00:06:39,273 --> 00:06:41,818
It's logic processor
has become contaminated.

93
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:42,985
That said,

94
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:44,862
it is a valuable piece
of gear, Tallis.

95
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:46,531
We should take it.

96
00:06:46,614 --> 00:06:48,199
Too heavy.
Don't need it.

97
00:06:48,282 --> 00:06:50,910
I'm still in good order. Need a little TLC.

98
00:06:50,993 --> 00:06:53,746
I could still run a full maintenance check
up to a few months ago.

99
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:55,206
Oh, come on, guys.

100
00:06:55,289 --> 00:06:58,209
There's four cans
of fresh linked ammo by the wall.

101
00:06:58,292 --> 00:07:00,211
I'm a son of a bitch in battle.

102
00:07:00,294 --> 00:07:02,755
The personification
of pure hell in a firefight.

103
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:03,798
You'll never regret it.

104
00:07:03,881 --> 00:07:05,007
The first rule of action

105
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:07,802
is to survive
by any means possible.

106
00:07:07,885 --> 00:07:10,555
Contact with the enemy
should be avoided at all costs.

107
00:07:10,638 --> 00:07:12,682
God damn it.

108
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:15,226
Book-quotin', Bible-bashin'--

109
00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:18,187
Toss me into the eternal
lake of fire if I lie.

110
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:20,648
It's the damn loneliness
that kills me.

111
00:07:44,338 --> 00:07:46,257
Switching to Doppler frequency.

112
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:47,967
Microwave sensors engaged.

113
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:50,344
Interlacing comprehensive ECMs.

114
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:57,328
It is with a heavy heart
that I address you tonight.

115
00:08:57,411 --> 00:09:00,790
Heavy because I am proud
to tears to see you in all your glory.

116
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:03,834
Heavy because of where I must send you.

117
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:07,129
You are the vicious hounds of combat.

118
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:09,298
My dogs of war...

119
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:12,176
to be unleashed
when all else has failed.

120
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:15,179
And this eve...

121
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,847
this day...

122
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:19,308
that shall be forever
etched in the history books

123
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:21,352
has already seen great failure.

124
00:09:21,435 --> 00:09:24,105
Scammel's forces have been
defeated in the Mojave.

125
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,359
Brigadier Richards' ground troops

126
00:09:28,442 --> 00:09:30,236
have been crippled in Mexico.

127
00:09:30,319 --> 00:09:31,737
And the Navy

128
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:33,864
and the Marines' finest

129
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:35,866
are now fish food...

130
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:37,368
all along the Pacific basin.

131
00:09:37,451 --> 00:09:39,370
Operators,

132
00:09:39,453 --> 00:09:40,830
you...

133
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:43,040
you are the best there is--

134
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:45,376
the meanest and most
ruthlessly efficient

135
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:47,044
shock force in the world.

136
00:09:48,462 --> 00:09:51,465
You now have the opportunity
to prove yourselves.

137
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:55,845
Like no other time
in our history,

138
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:57,346
your country needs you.

139
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:02,476
You have two ways
to end this day:

140
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:04,145
victory,

141
00:10:04,228 --> 00:10:06,397
by killing
the drone police force,

142
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,481
or death.

143
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:10,735
You!

144
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:13,154
You are the last
of the last, gentlemen.

145
00:10:15,072 --> 00:10:16,157
Fight hard!

146
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:18,784
And fight mean!

147
00:10:20,494 --> 00:10:22,830
And fight till the last round!

148
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,501
Maintain your positions.

149
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:31,130
... prepare to evac.

150
00:10:31,213 --> 00:10:33,299
And then draw your blade

151
00:10:33,382 --> 00:10:34,842
and fight with that!

152
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:38,262
I'll see you all in hell,

153
00:10:39,513 --> 00:10:41,515
you bastards of the 700th.

154
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:45,269
Brick 5 is down.

155
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:47,396
We are not in contact.

156
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,857
All frequencies dead.

157
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:58,157
Jesus, that's some
heavy fuckin' ordnance.

158
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,242
Estimate we're off target
by three clicks.

159
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:02,453
They dropped us right in the middle
of a drone skirmish line.

160
00:11:02,536 --> 00:11:04,121
Coordinates check positive.

161
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:06,457
Chopper pilots
must have got spooked.

162
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:09,460
The drone skirmish line
now extends beyond the DMZ.

163
00:11:09,543 --> 00:11:10,795
There is no Green Zone.

164
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:13,297
Where the hell's the rest of Brick 4?

165
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:14,382
We're all that's left.

166
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:16,801
Get on the radio!

167
00:11:16,884 --> 00:11:19,220
-Get that minigun up here!
-Coming in!

168
00:11:27,311 --> 00:11:28,562
We gotta make for the structures.

169
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:32,483
-This ORP won't hold!
-Agreed, Tallis.

170
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:34,860
Fire mission to the street!

171
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:37,446
Then east
to the black combat building.

172
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:43,494
Go! Go! Go! Go!

173
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,076
They've zeroed in on us!

174
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,244
We need a diversion!

175
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:10,206
One man moving fast...

176
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:13,417
Make a lot of noise,
we'll draw their fire

177
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:15,586
and give you
the opening you need!

178
00:13:15,669 --> 00:13:18,506
By drawing their fire,
you'll be cut to shreds!

179
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:22,551
Make a lot of noise, soldier!

180
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:24,220
Good luck.

181
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:26,013
No such thing as luck, Chief.

182
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:13,644
Fall out! Let's go!

183
00:14:13,727 --> 00:14:15,271
Move it! Move!

184
00:15:43,525 --> 00:15:44,735
We should still attempt access

185
00:15:44,818 --> 00:15:46,153
into the black combat building

186
00:15:46,236 --> 00:15:48,238
through the eastern port.

187
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:49,740
East is out.

188
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:51,492
The City of Thebes Refinery

189
00:15:51,575 --> 00:15:53,661
presents an excellent
target of opportunity.

190
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:56,330
We'll head straight for the refinery.

191
00:15:57,665 --> 00:15:59,541
No guarantee it's not compromised.

192
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,586
You lead, brother.

193
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:05,089
Our current position
has been laser designated.

194
00:16:05,172 --> 00:16:06,840
I advise leaving immediately.

195
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:40,207
I'm registering movement
all around our position,

196
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:41,625
and none of it friendly.

197
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:44,211
Still trying to breach
the satellite frequency.

198
00:16:44,294 --> 00:16:46,380
They appear to have
shut us out, Tallis.

199
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:49,758
Shit, intercom and radio
are both dead.

200
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:52,219
No intelligence,
runnin' microwave and Doppler.

201
00:16:52,302 --> 00:16:53,804
Frequency hopping.

202
00:16:53,887 --> 00:16:55,806
Seeking burst transmissions
on a satellite band.

203
00:16:55,889 --> 00:16:58,142
I got static.

204
00:16:58,225 --> 00:17:01,145
Operator 1 1 020, copy.

205
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:03,814
Brick 5 team leader,
Clausewitz legend, over.

206
00:17:03,897 --> 00:17:05,816
It's getting awful quiet over there.

207
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:10,112
1 4 minutes and 38 seconds,

208
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:11,655
that's all it took the E-700

209
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:13,490
to silence the big,
bad drone police.

210
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:15,325
Can you believe that?
Go E-700!

211
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:18,287
Try the ECM booster.

212
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:23,167
I'm down to three clips
and four grenades. You?

213
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:27,171
Shit, two magazines, no grenades.

214
00:17:27,254 --> 00:17:29,798
Good thing we won this war.
We'd be in trouble.

215
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:31,175
Yeah, because of
that green victory flag.

216
00:17:31,258 --> 00:17:33,385
E-700 never lost
a fight it got into.

217
00:17:35,929 --> 00:17:37,598
Should have been all over
the com-sat by now.

218
00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:39,266
Must have missed it.

219
00:17:39,349 --> 00:17:40,934
Tallis, we got company.

220
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:19,681
Surrounded and outnumbered.

221
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:20,974
Attack?

222
00:18:23,727 --> 00:18:24,978
Attack.

223
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:20,779
Incubating Sergeant Anchilles'
Eye Cap black box

224
00:21:20,862 --> 00:21:22,614
for future data retrieval.

225
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:29,037
Sergeant Anchilles
was incorrect, Tallis.

226
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:31,164
E-700th didn't win in 1 4 minutes.

227
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:32,582
What do you mean?

228
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:35,085
I successfully breached
the secure signal.

229
00:21:35,168 --> 00:21:38,422
I'm also checking through
my advanced ECM scanner.

230
00:21:38,505 --> 00:21:40,507
The drones have complete
and total control

231
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:42,092
of our intelligence system.

232
00:21:42,175 --> 00:21:44,636
The 700th has lost this war, Tallis.

233
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,972
We're on our own from here.

234
00:21:47,055 --> 00:21:50,600
Sergeant Anchilles 1 1 036.

235
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:53,562
His name will be added
to the list of the fallen.

236
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:00,819
Warning.

237
00:22:00,902 --> 00:22:02,571
Hazardous situation
approaching.

238
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:04,031
High danger potential.

239
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:06,450
This could be the war
catching up with us, Tallis.

240
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:08,577
I recommend
immediate intervention.

241
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:22,549
-Come on!
-Go!

242
00:22:24,217 --> 00:22:26,136
Drive faster!

243
00:22:26,219 --> 00:22:27,554
Shoot the truck!

244
00:23:35,122 --> 00:23:36,957
A perfect pinwheel ambush.

245
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:39,042
One can only admire
the clarity of purpose

246
00:23:39,126 --> 00:23:40,961
of a soldier with no emotions,

247
00:23:41,044 --> 00:23:42,462
no feelings, no fear.

248
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:53,557
Those are human beings down there.

249
00:24:09,322 --> 00:24:11,324
Engaging comprehensive ECM.

250
00:24:14,578 --> 00:24:16,246
All clear, Tallis.

251
00:24:16,329 --> 00:24:19,958
Doppler and microwave scanners
show the drones have left us alone.

252
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:22,335
There are no survivors here.

253
00:24:24,045 --> 00:24:26,256
Looks like someone
disagrees with you.

254
00:24:26,339 --> 00:24:28,341
The concrete must have
masked her body temperature.

255
00:24:54,117 --> 00:24:55,994
Are you going to stare
at her all day,

256
00:24:56,077 --> 00:24:58,371
or attempt to administer
medical attention?

257
00:25:09,758 --> 00:25:11,218
How's she doing internally?

258
00:25:11,301 --> 00:25:13,803
I wasn't designed for it, but...

259
00:25:13,887 --> 00:25:16,723
my modular scanner shows
her bone structure's intact.

260
00:25:16,806 --> 00:25:19,226
Her temperature seems a stable 98.

261
00:25:19,309 --> 00:25:21,311
The type-B blood
and brain matter on her face

262
00:25:21,394 --> 00:25:22,854
are not hers.

263
00:25:25,398 --> 00:25:26,775
What are you doing?

264
00:25:28,318 --> 00:25:29,903
It's a Hyrex patch.

265
00:25:29,986 --> 00:25:32,822
Shrimp protein
to stop the bleeding.

266
00:25:32,906 --> 00:25:35,075
It'll help you mend.

267
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:41,081
She seems pathologically aggressive.

268
00:25:42,415 --> 00:25:45,252
She's prepared to fight.
Her equipment is low-tech--

269
00:25:45,335 --> 00:25:48,338
pro-am surplus--
but it displays methodology.

270
00:25:48,421 --> 00:25:50,966
That means there's
an organization somewhere.

271
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:53,343
There may be
a resistance movement after all.

272
00:25:53,426 --> 00:25:55,136
You're not getting
any younger, Tallis.

273
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:57,806
It might be time
to find our cause.

274
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:05,897
I'm here today to tell you about
the eastern drone army

275
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:07,357
and what it means to you.

276
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,359
The USA as we know it.

277
00:26:09,442 --> 00:26:12,362
The blue areas represent overpopulation,

278
00:26:12,445 --> 00:26:14,281
crime, and unemployment.

279
00:26:14,364 --> 00:26:16,241
The red areas are safe,

280
00:26:16,324 --> 00:26:18,201
God-fearing, low-crime communities.

281
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:19,744
Now watch on this graph

282
00:26:19,828 --> 00:26:22,372
as the computer-enhanced
demographics show

283
00:26:22,455 --> 00:26:25,208
what has happened
over the last 20 years.

284
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:26,918
America's in crisis.

285
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:30,171
Our laws, our politicians,
are not working.

286
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:33,967
Our once great country
is on the brink of self-destruction.

287
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:36,803
This is bad, unthinkable.
I know you agree.

288
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:39,931
This is the eastern drone soldier.

289
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:41,975
He's the backbone
of the drone police army--

290
00:26:42,058 --> 00:26:45,228
their nightstick,
their scales of justice--

291
00:26:45,312 --> 00:26:47,063
a politician and policeman.

292
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:49,399
He is good.
He's your friend.

293
00:26:49,482 --> 00:26:50,817
And he's here to help.

294
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:52,402
Thanks, Laura.

295
00:26:52,485 --> 00:26:54,237
Hi, Folks.
My name's Fryar Dooley.

296
00:26:54,321 --> 00:26:55,405
I'm usually on the evening news.

297
00:26:55,488 --> 00:26:57,991
-But today...
-Drone police propaganda.

298
00:26:58,074 --> 00:26:59,409
You really think the key
to their defeat

299
00:26:59,492 --> 00:27:01,411
is in watching those
old news broadcasts?

300
00:27:01,494 --> 00:27:03,913
Every day, we get older, slower,

301
00:27:03,997 --> 00:27:04,914
while they get smarter.

302
00:27:04,998 --> 00:27:06,833
The drones need humans.

303
00:27:06,916 --> 00:27:08,960
They've never been self-sufficient.

304
00:27:14,215 --> 00:27:15,216
Where am I?

305
00:27:17,344 --> 00:27:19,888
About 300 yards from
where your vehicle crashed.

306
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:23,516
You dressed my wounds.

307
00:27:24,851 --> 00:27:25,894
You'll live.

308
00:27:31,024 --> 00:27:33,818
I've got combat rations,
if you're hungry.

309
00:27:35,445 --> 00:27:36,946
You'd share?

310
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:49,167
Who are you?

311
00:27:52,379 --> 00:27:53,922
Speak now.

312
00:27:56,216 --> 00:27:58,551
There's 500k of uncut Hemex
in that pistol grip.

313
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:02,013
Trigger mechanism inoperable.

314
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:04,891
You are not the authorized user
of this weapon.

315
00:28:04,974 --> 00:28:07,477
He's offering to share
his food with you.

316
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,479
Did your rifle just talk to me?

317
00:28:09,562 --> 00:28:13,149
Tallis was hardwired to kill,
not to nurse.

318
00:28:13,233 --> 00:28:15,527
So choose your
next move carefully.

319
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:18,905
Do you want any of this?

320
00:28:39,926 --> 00:28:41,970
You're one of the E-700,

321
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:44,431
the special brigade
shock troops.

322
00:28:46,933 --> 00:28:48,601
We heard you all bought it.

323
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:50,520
That's what happened.

324
00:28:50,603 --> 00:28:53,273
Tallis has become something
of a virtuoso in survival.

325
00:28:54,607 --> 00:28:57,110
I'm with a paramilitary cell
based out in the desert.

326
00:28:58,194 --> 00:29:00,530
We were on a reconnoiter in town.

327
00:29:00,613 --> 00:29:02,574
Got busted
by a drone scout patrol.

328
00:29:05,618 --> 00:29:07,537
How'd the others do?

329
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:10,039
No.

330
00:29:10,123 --> 00:29:11,958
They all died fighting.

331
00:29:16,629 --> 00:29:18,548
You're like them.

332
00:29:18,631 --> 00:29:21,468
You're genetically engineered, right?

333
00:29:21,551 --> 00:29:23,470
Not like them.

334
00:29:23,553 --> 00:29:25,013
Tallis is electronically enhanced,

335
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:26,389
not a cyborg.

336
00:29:26,473 --> 00:29:29,559
He has a nanotransmitter relay device
in his eye.

337
00:29:29,642 --> 00:29:31,561
Otherwise, he's human like you.

338
00:29:31,644 --> 00:29:34,272
The drones are biomechanical replicants.

339
00:29:34,355 --> 00:29:36,065
If you ever see one without its mask,

340
00:29:36,149 --> 00:29:37,901
you'll understand.

341
00:29:37,984 --> 00:29:40,236
I've read about you guys.

342
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:43,573
You run off a data disc or something.

343
00:29:43,656 --> 00:29:45,241
Hell, did I ever get you wrong.

344
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:50,246
I am a Violex Systems
advanced intellect superscope,

345
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:51,456
representing the top of the line

346
00:29:51,539 --> 00:29:53,041
in battlefield nanocomputers.

347
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:55,001
I'm approximately
four times as advanced

348
00:29:55,084 --> 00:29:56,586
as the regular police drone,

349
00:29:56,669 --> 00:29:58,588
and as close to artificial intelligence

350
00:29:58,671 --> 00:30:00,590
as you're ever likely to encounter.

351
00:30:00,673 --> 00:30:03,426
I receive my directives
from Tallis' Eye Cap.

352
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:05,595
If he dies, I serve no purpose.

353
00:30:05,678 --> 00:30:07,388
So consequently, I also die.

354
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:11,684
What's happening out there?

355
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:15,355
Most people are
too shocked to do anything.

356
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:18,691
Others took to Iiving underground...

357
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:21,528
like rats.

358
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:24,697
Some of us chose to fight.

359
00:30:26,574 --> 00:30:27,617
To make a stand.

360
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:29,619
Who's running the drones?

361
00:30:29,702 --> 00:30:32,705
They run off their first initiative...

362
00:30:32,956 --> 00:30:35,124
to kill human beings.

363
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:36,960
Every month we make
a sortie trying to find

364
00:30:37,043 --> 00:30:38,628
the new nerve center.

365
00:30:38,711 --> 00:30:41,130
If we can find it,

366
00:30:41,214 --> 00:30:42,632
destroy it,
then theoretically

367
00:30:42,715 --> 00:30:44,384
we can disable them.

368
00:30:45,718 --> 00:30:47,637
Any luck?

369
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,722
Based on intercepted
radio transmissions,

370
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:51,224
the drones
are being run out of

371
00:30:51,307 --> 00:30:52,642
the City of Thebes Refinery.

372
00:30:52,725 --> 00:30:54,352
The City of Thebes was the target

373
00:30:54,435 --> 00:30:55,728
of our final great assault.

374
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:58,231
Our last stand.

375
00:30:58,314 --> 00:31:00,650
It's their vulnerable underbelly.

376
00:31:00,733 --> 00:31:03,152
They know that, you know?

377
00:31:03,236 --> 00:31:04,654
So they're like a guard dog

378
00:31:04,737 --> 00:31:06,656
protecting their dead master.

379
00:31:06,739 --> 00:31:10,535
If I can get into the nerve center

380
00:31:10,618 --> 00:31:12,662
and steal the memory decoder,

381
00:31:12,745 --> 00:31:14,497
and get it back to my cell--

382
00:31:14,581 --> 00:31:16,249
You need rest.

383
00:31:19,752 --> 00:31:22,630
I need a wash.

384
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:24,674
We have a rain tank.

385
00:31:24,757 --> 00:31:26,718
lt's cold but clean.

386
00:31:30,597 --> 00:31:31,764
It'll do.

387
00:31:42,275 --> 00:31:43,359
She's correct.

388
00:31:43,443 --> 00:31:46,237
Your DNA is closer
to drone than human.

389
00:31:46,321 --> 00:31:48,072
Like the drone,
we must respond

390
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:50,158
to our primary objective.

391
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:52,410
That's what drives us
beyond personal survival.

392
00:31:52,493 --> 00:31:54,203
We live for the need to fight.

393
00:31:54,287 --> 00:31:55,580
To kill the enemy.

394
00:31:55,663 --> 00:31:57,373
To stop it at all costs.

395
00:31:58,666 --> 00:32:00,793
This, Tallis, is our credo.

396
00:32:14,724 --> 00:32:17,226
Without further orders,

397
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:19,354
our prerogative is
to maintain cover.

398
00:32:23,816 --> 00:32:25,234
Let's join her, Tallis.

399
00:32:25,318 --> 00:32:27,070
Let's get back in the war.

400
00:32:27,153 --> 00:32:28,738
As character defines destiny,

401
00:32:28,821 --> 00:32:30,698
this is your destiny.

402
00:32:33,701 --> 00:32:36,371
What are you thinking, Tallis?

403
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:58,101
Machine parts and servo drive
retro-checking.

404
00:32:58,184 --> 00:32:59,727
I need a grease application.

405
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:01,437
We're low on T.A.P. rounds,

406
00:33:01,521 --> 00:33:03,356
and only 8 depleted AA rounds left.

407
00:33:04,857 --> 00:33:06,526
Logic prevents me from
advocating contact with the enemy

408
00:33:06,609 --> 00:33:07,777
in such a state, Tallis.

409
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:09,779
But in truth, we have no choice.

410
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:20,373
There's no such thing as luck.

411
00:33:20,456 --> 00:33:22,792
lt's talent meeting opportunity.

412
00:33:22,875 --> 00:33:27,755
He who trains...wins.

413
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:29,799
Slash! Stab!

414
00:33:29,882 --> 00:33:31,676
Slash, slash, recover!

415
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:33,761
Slash! Stab!

416
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:35,263
Slash, slash, recover!

417
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:52,697
Attack, Tallis.

418
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:55,825
Attack!

419
00:33:55,908 --> 00:33:59,829
EE-700 special operator.

420
00:33:59,912 --> 00:34:03,666
The EE stands for
electronically enhanced.

421
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:07,336
You are an engineered supersoldier.

422
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:10,298
In addition
to your regular studies,

423
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:12,925
you will receive digital input
on a daily basis.

424
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:15,053
The encoded transmissions will be read

425
00:34:15,136 --> 00:34:19,182
and stored in your personal ICU disc.

426
00:34:19,265 --> 00:34:21,267
Your Eye Cap.

427
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:23,853
The information on your Eye Cap
is available to you.

428
00:34:23,936 --> 00:34:27,982
It is what makes you so very unique.

429
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:30,651
It is to be respected and utilized

430
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:32,862
as any other weapon in your arsenal.

431
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:05,561
I'm joining you.

432
00:35:09,899 --> 00:35:11,526
Good.

433
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:13,903
Charcoal and coated Kevlar.

434
00:35:13,986 --> 00:35:15,905
It'll disguise your body temperature.

435
00:35:18,991 --> 00:35:20,910
Police drone issue,

436
00:35:20,993 --> 00:35:22,787
I rewired it safe.

437
00:35:26,582 --> 00:35:27,750
You got a plan?

438
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:29,377
We hit them
with so much ordnance,

439
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:30,878
they think it's a full assault.

440
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:32,672
In the confusion, we slip in and out

441
00:35:32,755 --> 00:35:34,423
before they realize it's a diversion.

442
00:35:36,342 --> 00:35:37,677
Then you present me
to your commanders

443
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,595
for a debriefing and a report.

444
00:35:42,306 --> 00:35:43,933
You're not big on the whole

445
00:35:44,016 --> 00:35:45,768
personality thing, are you?

446
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:48,855
You need to rest.

447
00:35:48,938 --> 00:35:50,815
I'll wake you
when it's time to leave.

448
00:35:57,947 --> 00:35:59,031
My name is Tallis.

449
00:36:01,784 --> 00:36:04,245
I have
no company commander,

450
00:36:04,328 --> 00:36:05,955
no orders.

451
00:36:06,038 --> 00:36:07,915
I'm the last of my squad alive.

452
00:36:08,916 --> 00:36:10,251
However, I continue
to be a member

453
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:11,878
of the E-700th.

454
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:08,017
I found this book...

455
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:10,561
by Charlotte Bronte.

456
00:37:13,105 --> 00:37:15,024
And I was reading late.

457
00:37:15,107 --> 00:37:16,108
I read it.

458
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:19,820
I read them all.

459
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:23,574
It's time to leave.

460
00:38:23,759 --> 00:38:26,095
There's not supposed
to be this much activity, Tallis.

461
00:38:29,056 --> 00:38:31,100
You wanna go back?

462
00:38:31,183 --> 00:38:34,103
Our intelligence was wrong, but...

463
00:38:34,186 --> 00:38:35,521
this is the place.

464
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:40,067
Keep going.

465
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:42,903
Shut down core transmission.

466
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:44,113
We don't wanna advertise.

467
00:38:44,196 --> 00:38:46,115
Satellite beacon going inactive.

468
00:38:46,198 --> 00:38:47,533
Canceling signal hopper.

469
00:38:47,616 --> 00:38:50,077
I'm very uncomfortable with this.

470
00:39:38,667 --> 00:39:40,836
We have been compromised, Tallis.

471
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:49,595
Back the way we came!

472
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:05,861
Go back to the wire.
Run! I'll catch up.

473
00:40:12,535 --> 00:40:15,037
Thermobaric charge the
light green pipe, Tallis.

474
00:40:15,121 --> 00:40:16,539
Liquid fuel blast will white out

475
00:40:16,622 --> 00:40:18,124
the drones ECMs for at least 10 minutes.

476
00:40:18,207 --> 00:40:19,417
Give us our exit.

477
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:21,127
Let's go! Go!

478
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:22,586
Move! Move!

479
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:25,149
Pretty trick with
the blade there, Tallis.

480
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:28,777
Dying due to insufficient intelligence

481
00:41:28,861 --> 00:41:29,862
would be a failure.

482
00:41:32,031 --> 00:41:33,282
They're like fire ants.

483
00:41:33,365 --> 00:41:36,577
How did you survive this long?

484
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:39,288
One theory would be
a life of uneven odds

485
00:41:39,371 --> 00:41:40,623
and good fortune.

486
00:41:40,706 --> 00:41:43,125
Just lucky, I guess.

487
00:41:43,209 --> 00:41:44,877
EE-700 doesn't believe in luck,

488
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,296
just talent meeting opportunity.

489
00:41:47,379 --> 00:41:50,007
We're gonna see the sunrise again.

490
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:52,635
Any day you see the sunrise...

491
00:41:52,718 --> 00:41:54,136
is a good day.

492
00:41:55,387 --> 00:41:56,805
Here's a plan:

493
00:41:56,889 --> 00:41:59,391
maybe we leave
the girl behind next time, Tallis.

494
00:42:14,406 --> 00:42:15,991
I wanna learn.

495
00:42:18,118 --> 00:42:19,411
I wanna learn what you do.

496
00:42:34,426 --> 00:42:36,428
Now come at me.

497
00:42:47,439 --> 00:42:49,066
Power begins with balance.

498
00:42:49,149 --> 00:42:50,442
You must lower
your center of gravity.

499
00:42:50,734 --> 00:42:52,361
You must find
your dominant side.

500
00:42:52,444 --> 00:42:54,989
Train it to work with your body
and mind, not against them.

501
00:42:55,072 --> 00:42:56,991
How?

502
00:42:57,074 --> 00:42:59,034
Both eyes open and point at the wall.

503
00:43:00,452 --> 00:43:02,955
Without moving, close either eye.

504
00:43:04,164 --> 00:43:06,166
The one that lines up
is your dominant side.

505
00:43:10,963 --> 00:43:12,006
Very good.

506
00:43:29,231 --> 00:43:30,899
She's a slow learner, Tallis.

507
00:43:30,983 --> 00:43:32,776
She's trying.

508
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:34,486
She could get you killed.

509
00:43:38,032 --> 00:43:39,033
Maybe.

510
00:43:42,202 --> 00:43:45,080
Lean into your shot
when acquiring your target.

511
00:43:45,164 --> 00:43:46,498
Otherwise the force of the recoil

512
00:43:46,749 --> 00:43:50,127
will dictate where you shoot.

513
00:44:03,307 --> 00:44:06,101
You are volunteers.

514
00:44:06,185 --> 00:44:09,063
You have all volunteered
to die for your country.

515
00:44:09,146 --> 00:44:12,816
So you've come to the best place
in the world for dying.

516
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:14,902
Consider yourselves dead already,

517
00:44:14,985 --> 00:44:16,070
and the fear will go away.

518
00:44:16,153 --> 00:44:18,447
Then you'll be able
to kill the enemy.

519
00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:21,367
This is Sergeant Anchilles.

520
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:22,660
He's going to tell
you about your rifle.

521
00:44:29,541 --> 00:44:31,293
This is a Track 55,

522
00:44:31,377 --> 00:44:33,045
urban termination rifIe.

523
00:44:33,128 --> 00:44:36,465
From the moment you receive it,
it is your best friend,

524
00:44:36,548 --> 00:44:41,345
your lover, your mother,
all wrapped into one.

525
00:44:41,428 --> 00:44:43,806
If you lose it, you die.

526
00:44:43,889 --> 00:44:45,224
If you break it,

527
00:44:45,307 --> 00:44:47,309
you will die.

528
00:44:47,393 --> 00:44:50,312
If you get it rusty or dirty,

529
00:44:50,396 --> 00:44:53,315
you guessed it, you die.

530
00:44:53,399 --> 00:44:55,442
Our job here,

531
00:44:55,526 --> 00:44:57,319
and my life,

532
00:44:57,403 --> 00:45:01,156
depends on your living.

533
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:04,743
So I'm going to teach you
how to maintain your sidearm.

534
00:45:08,706 --> 00:45:11,166
We're in trouble, Tallis.

535
00:45:16,213 --> 00:45:17,297
Life forms approaching.

536
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:18,757
They have small arms

537
00:45:18,841 --> 00:45:21,635
and I'm picking up
crew-served weapon systems.

538
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:24,012
Threat level, dangerous, Tallis.

539
00:45:24,096 --> 00:45:26,014
Tallis, what is it?

540
00:45:27,391 --> 00:45:28,392
Look.

541
00:45:31,895 --> 00:45:34,189
This don't look good.

542
00:45:34,273 --> 00:45:35,274
Get the men ready.

543
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:00,966
How long can you hold
this line, Corporal?

544
00:46:01,049 --> 00:46:03,677
Until I'm out
of ammo and dead, sir.

545
00:46:03,761 --> 00:46:05,429
Hang in there.

546
00:46:10,768 --> 00:46:12,895
3-6-1-4,

547
00:46:12,978 --> 00:46:14,188
demanding air support.

548
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:17,775
Coordinates are
alpha, alpha, tango

549
00:46:17,858 --> 00:46:20,819
360 by 275, over!

550
00:46:20,903 --> 00:46:23,071
What the hell are you
still doing here, Tallis?

551
00:46:23,155 --> 00:46:25,032
My position got smoked.

552
00:46:25,115 --> 00:46:27,159
What are you doing here, Washington?

553
00:46:27,242 --> 00:46:29,661
Eastern trench line, it's toast.

554
00:46:29,745 --> 00:46:31,288
They're all dead.
Every one of them.

555
00:46:31,371 --> 00:46:32,372
So we withdrew.

556
00:46:32,456 --> 00:46:33,832
I suggest you two do the same.

557
00:46:33,916 --> 00:46:35,209
There's an extraction bird

558
00:46:35,292 --> 00:46:36,752
inbound at this time.

559
00:46:36,835 --> 00:46:38,253
1 2 clicks out.

560
00:46:38,337 --> 00:46:39,713
How's that air support?

561
00:46:39,797 --> 00:46:41,256
D.C. postponed indefinitely.

562
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:42,382
I'm with you, Washington.

563
00:46:42,466 --> 00:46:43,383
Let's go.

564
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:44,384
I'm staying.

565
00:46:44,468 --> 00:46:45,385
You're staying?

566
00:46:45,469 --> 00:46:46,470
We got them into this.

567
00:46:48,889 --> 00:46:49,807
You're going to get me killed.

568
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:51,934
You two have compromised your logic.

569
00:46:52,017 --> 00:46:53,018
We're out of here.

570
00:46:53,101 --> 00:46:54,186
Go!

571
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:07,866
Get your people out
of there, Sergeant,

572
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:09,117
it's going to be a big one.

573
00:47:09,201 --> 00:47:10,327
Air support inbound!

574
00:47:10,410 --> 00:47:11,829
Get down!

575
00:47:32,182 --> 00:47:34,393
The vultures will feast.

576
00:47:34,476 --> 00:47:37,020
The thermobaric bombardment
cooked them.

577
00:47:37,104 --> 00:47:41,942
It's a dead zone, Anchilles.

578
00:47:42,025 --> 00:47:44,361
Oh, well.

579
00:47:44,444 --> 00:47:45,988
It's better to go out with a bang

580
00:47:46,071 --> 00:47:48,031
than to fade away.

581
00:47:55,789 --> 00:47:57,291
Buddha said,

582
00:47:57,374 --> 00:48:00,878
"The path of all suffering
was born of desire."

583
00:48:04,172 --> 00:48:06,466
She hates the drones.

584
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:08,093
Never underestimate hate

585
00:48:08,176 --> 00:48:09,970
as a source of motivation.

586
00:48:10,053 --> 00:48:12,014
She'll do.

587
00:48:12,097 --> 00:48:13,265
I hope you're correct, Tallis.

588
00:48:13,348 --> 00:48:14,766
Because when you die,

589
00:48:14,850 --> 00:48:16,476
in effect, we both die.

590
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:18,812
All of this will have
been a terrible waste.

591
00:48:45,005 --> 00:48:47,883
Wear this.

592
00:48:47,966 --> 00:48:49,509
What is it?

593
00:48:49,593 --> 00:48:51,470
Binary explosive.

594
00:48:51,553 --> 00:48:54,097
RDX Hemex mix.

595
00:48:54,181 --> 00:48:56,308
It won't detonate
on impact or fire,

596
00:48:56,391 --> 00:48:58,852
but you tap this striker
three times,

597
00:48:58,936 --> 00:49:01,188
it'll flatten two city blocks.

598
00:49:01,271 --> 00:49:02,856
I don't believe in suicide.

599
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:05,192
When you plan to lose, you lose.

600
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:10,614
Sometimes it's unavoidable.

601
00:49:10,906 --> 00:49:11,907
Wear it.

602
00:49:23,043 --> 00:49:25,545
We get on the roof of this building.

603
00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:29,174
Cross roof to roof
to the nerve center.

604
00:49:29,257 --> 00:49:31,134
You see me look right,
you look left.

605
00:49:31,218 --> 00:49:33,220
Like FIBUA training.

606
00:49:33,303 --> 00:49:35,222
Detonate the place charges
and deploy the grenades.

607
00:49:35,305 --> 00:49:37,182
Enter immediately.

608
00:49:37,265 --> 00:49:38,850
Make for your coordinates.

609
00:49:38,934 --> 00:49:41,228
Appropriate the drone data.

610
00:49:41,311 --> 00:49:43,563
In and out as quickly
as possible.

611
00:49:43,647 --> 00:49:45,941
Keep moving.
Don't get cornered.

612
00:49:46,024 --> 00:49:49,653
In exchange of fire,
you'll always lose.

613
00:50:14,177 --> 00:50:15,679
Here.

614
00:50:15,971 --> 00:50:18,932
Pack these explosives at
the base of the structure.

615
00:50:19,016 --> 00:50:20,267
Take out the building.

616
00:51:27,584 --> 00:51:28,668
Ready?

617
00:51:28,752 --> 00:51:29,753
Uh-huh.

618
00:51:35,092 --> 00:51:38,428
Detonate the charges.

619
00:52:59,843 --> 00:53:01,344
Here!

620
00:53:18,653 --> 00:53:20,697
I'm fine. I'm all right.

621
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:21,823
Which way?

622
00:53:21,907 --> 00:53:22,908
Left at the end.

623
00:53:32,375 --> 00:53:35,086
In here.
That's the room.

624
00:53:36,755 --> 00:53:38,340
Get what you need
and get out quick.

625
00:53:38,423 --> 00:53:39,424
Okay.

626
00:54:08,119 --> 00:54:09,037
Move it.

627
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:10,121
Come on.

628
00:54:13,416 --> 00:54:14,417
Keep moving!

629
00:54:16,002 --> 00:54:17,003
Get back!

630
00:54:21,132 --> 00:54:22,133
Okay, let's go.

631
00:54:24,135 --> 00:54:25,637
Come on. Go! Go!

632
00:54:52,664 --> 00:54:54,165
Move it! Move!

633
00:54:54,416 --> 00:54:56,626
Go! Go!

634
00:55:04,175 --> 00:55:05,719
Back up! Back up!

635
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:18,648
Keep moving!

636
00:55:18,732 --> 00:55:19,733
Let's go!

637
00:55:36,166 --> 00:55:37,876
All right. Hold on!

638
00:55:47,218 --> 00:55:48,928
Come on!

639
00:56:06,905 --> 00:56:09,491
They're routing the auxiliary
drone reinforcements.

640
00:56:09,574 --> 00:56:12,077
This position is hazardous, Tallis.

641
00:56:14,662 --> 00:56:17,248
We could always ask them to surrender!

642
00:56:30,970 --> 00:56:32,514
Do you trust me?

643
00:56:32,597 --> 00:56:34,182
Sure!

644
00:56:34,265 --> 00:56:35,725
Take out your suicide belt.

645
00:56:35,809 --> 00:56:37,685
My pleasure.

646
00:56:39,979 --> 00:56:40,897
Charge it!

647
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:42,107
That's your plan?

648
00:56:51,658 --> 00:56:54,202
There's a two second delay
on the third charge.

649
00:56:54,285 --> 00:56:55,620
We go out the window together!

650
00:56:55,703 --> 00:56:58,206
That's forty feet down
to asphalt!

651
00:56:58,289 --> 00:57:01,209
The fall isn't going
to kill us! Just do it!

652
00:57:01,292 --> 00:57:02,210
Fine!

653
00:57:03,628 --> 00:57:05,713
Hemex warhead. Proximity fuse.

654
00:57:05,797 --> 00:57:08,133
Better to go out with a bang.

655
00:57:41,583 --> 00:57:42,792
What is this stuff?

656
00:57:42,876 --> 00:57:44,335
It'll disguise your
body temperature.

657
00:57:44,586 --> 00:57:46,337
Keep moving.

658
00:58:02,145 --> 00:58:05,023
All clear 360, Tallis.

659
00:58:21,372 --> 00:58:25,251
Another sunset and I can't move.

660
00:58:25,335 --> 00:58:31,257
No, I'm all right,
it's a figure of speech.

661
00:58:31,341 --> 00:58:33,885
You're actually lucky that
I'm here to look after you.

662
00:58:58,660 --> 00:59:00,245
I need a wash.

663
00:59:01,871 --> 00:59:02,789
Tallis.

664
00:59:02,872 --> 00:59:04,249
Tallis!

665
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,126
What happened?

666
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:09,087
He's lost too much blood.

667
00:59:09,170 --> 00:59:10,672
You have to administer
medical attention.

668
00:59:10,755 --> 00:59:14,008
Oh, Tallis...

669
01:00:32,420 --> 01:00:34,130
We're quits.

670
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:38,384
Quits?

671
01:00:38,468 --> 01:00:40,511
I fixed you up.
I figure we're equal.

672
01:00:44,265 --> 01:00:47,435
You need more rest, Captain.

673
01:00:47,518 --> 01:00:50,438
Drone patrols will
be looking for us.

674
01:00:50,521 --> 01:00:54,108
Okay, well, first you eat,

675
01:00:54,192 --> 01:00:56,986
get your strength back.

676
01:01:25,181 --> 01:01:26,182
Hey.

677
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:34,357
What are these markings?

678
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:38,111
Campaign profile.

679
01:01:40,279 --> 01:01:44,117
Each code denotes
a date and location.

680
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:47,787
It's my service record.

681
01:01:47,870 --> 01:01:51,749
Battle scars.

682
01:01:52,583 --> 01:01:56,504
I've been a soldier all my life.

683
01:01:56,587 --> 01:02:01,342
I've killed in 30
different countries, but...

684
01:02:03,553 --> 01:02:05,930
Then I have the advantage.

685
01:02:31,289 --> 01:02:33,541
Engaging forward-looking infrared.

686
01:02:33,624 --> 01:02:35,042
DCM activated.

687
01:02:55,104 --> 01:02:58,107
You disappeared.

688
01:02:59,650 --> 01:03:02,069
I like the view.

689
01:03:05,990 --> 01:03:07,825
You're a strange one, Tallis.

690
01:03:10,077 --> 01:03:11,245
I don't feel strange.

691
01:03:11,329 --> 01:03:16,209
I-- I need to get the discs
back to the militia.

692
01:03:20,296 --> 01:03:23,257
I want you to come with me.

693
01:03:23,341 --> 01:03:24,634
Join us.

694
01:03:27,053 --> 01:03:28,221
I can do that.

695
01:03:32,058 --> 01:03:34,227
There was somebody
at the drone nerve center.

696
01:03:34,310 --> 01:03:36,521
A human.

697
01:03:36,604 --> 01:03:38,606
It threw me.

698
01:03:40,900 --> 01:03:43,528
A small tactical unit would
be able to get back inside.

699
01:03:43,611 --> 01:03:48,032
You said
all the commanders are dead.

700
01:03:48,115 --> 01:03:50,952
That's the information
our intelligence gave us.

701
01:03:55,581 --> 01:03:57,542
We're going to need to get a car.

702
01:03:57,625 --> 01:03:59,418
It's a four-day drive to the south.

703
01:03:59,502 --> 01:04:00,670
We don't have that time.

704
01:04:00,753 --> 01:04:02,255
I can find one.

705
01:04:02,338 --> 01:04:04,465
I wonder what they're
going to think about you.

706
01:04:04,549 --> 01:04:07,385
They're soldiers, same as me.

707
01:04:09,971 --> 01:04:12,640
They don't make many
soldiers Iike you, Tallis.

708
01:04:12,932 --> 01:04:15,434
You're the last of your kind.

709
01:04:15,518 --> 01:04:16,644
You're a dinosaur.

710
01:04:41,502 --> 01:04:43,254
Be ready to leave when I return.

711
01:04:43,337 --> 01:04:45,381
I should be going with you.

712
01:04:50,219 --> 01:04:52,471
Would I have made it
in the E-700th?

713
01:04:55,516 --> 01:04:56,517
Unlikely.

714
01:05:30,009 --> 01:05:32,136
Do you know where you're going?

715
01:05:32,219 --> 01:05:34,472
There's a pick-up
on 5th and Alvarado.

716
01:05:34,555 --> 01:05:35,640
I checked the battery.

717
01:05:35,723 --> 01:05:36,641
We can clean it up.

718
01:05:36,724 --> 01:05:38,184
Fix the electrical system.

719
01:05:38,267 --> 01:05:40,102
A drone satellite beacon will locate us

720
01:05:40,186 --> 01:05:42,104
as soon as you engage the ignition.

721
01:05:42,188 --> 01:05:43,522
We will move fast.

722
01:05:43,606 --> 01:05:45,733
Your logic has become impaired, Tallis.

723
01:05:46,025 --> 01:05:48,027
We can make this work.

724
01:05:48,110 --> 01:05:53,157
A productive and helpful
member of modern society.

725
01:05:55,117 --> 01:06:00,164
I'm partnered with Patrol Delta
since last Easter.

726
01:06:00,247 --> 01:06:01,666
He was the best partner
a man could have.

727
01:06:01,749 --> 01:06:04,168
He took that bullet for me.

728
01:06:04,251 --> 01:06:05,169
No hesitation.

729
01:06:05,252 --> 01:06:06,879
Without thinking.

730
01:06:06,921 --> 01:06:10,341
What happened to finding a
tactically sound solution?

731
01:06:10,424 --> 01:06:12,551
She's in a hurry.

732
01:06:12,635 --> 01:06:15,262
Are your feelings towards
the deceased lessened

733
01:06:15,346 --> 01:06:17,682
because he's a cyborg clone,

734
01:06:17,765 --> 01:06:23,396
completely incapable
of any intelligence whatsoever?

735
01:06:23,479 --> 01:06:24,772
Get the hell out of here.

736
01:06:25,022 --> 01:06:26,315
Go on, get out of here!

737
01:06:26,399 --> 01:06:27,525
Go on, you goddamn vultures!

738
01:06:33,781 --> 01:06:36,534
It's kind of sad, you know,
in a sentimental way.

739
01:06:36,617 --> 01:06:39,245
I mean, my old man was a cop.
His old man, too.

740
01:06:39,328 --> 01:06:42,498
I realize my sons have
to find new professions.

741
01:06:42,581 --> 01:06:44,041
Don't get me wrong, now.

742
01:06:44,125 --> 01:06:45,960
I say it's sad for me
to be the last

743
01:06:46,043 --> 01:06:48,212
fully human cop
on active patrol.

744
01:06:48,295 --> 01:06:49,213
But I'll tell you what.

745
01:06:49,296 --> 01:06:50,548
With these guys out there,

746
01:06:50,631 --> 01:06:52,633
I'd be a lot sadder
if I was a criminal.

747
01:06:52,717 --> 01:06:55,553
These guys, they might
have had a chance with us,

748
01:06:55,636 --> 01:06:57,179
but they don't sleep.

749
01:06:57,263 --> 01:06:58,639
They use Doppler navigation,

750
01:06:58,723 --> 01:06:59,724
thermal imaging,

751
01:06:59,807 --> 01:07:01,475
radio-wave satellite communications,

752
01:07:01,559 --> 01:07:02,810
and I got to tell you,

753
01:07:03,060 --> 01:07:04,353
these guys never, ever miss.

754
01:07:12,611 --> 01:07:16,407
It's the theater, Tallis,
they waited for you to leave.

755
01:08:04,705 --> 01:08:06,165
She sacrificed herself

756
01:08:06,248 --> 01:08:08,584
rather than go as a prisoner.

757
01:08:08,667 --> 01:08:10,795
Whatever I said about her,
I take it back.

758
01:08:10,878 --> 01:08:12,755
But I don't understand why the drones

759
01:08:12,838 --> 01:08:14,423
waited for you to leave.

760
01:08:14,507 --> 01:08:18,636
The nature of the ambush displays
a non-lateral decision process.

761
01:08:18,719 --> 01:08:22,473
Imagine what Da Vinci or Socrates might
have achieved with your Eye Cap system.

762
01:08:22,556 --> 01:08:26,227
But you have it, and you
must do what you do best.

763
01:08:26,310 --> 01:08:27,812
You must continue to fight.

764
01:08:27,895 --> 01:08:29,063
Voice off, Angel.

765
01:08:29,146 --> 01:08:31,816
Complying. Voice off.

766
01:08:59,927 --> 01:09:03,222
Another sunset and I can't move.

767
01:09:03,305 --> 01:09:07,685
You're actually lucky that
I'm here to look after you.

768
01:09:07,768 --> 01:09:09,270
Another sunrise.

769
01:09:09,353 --> 01:09:12,481
Does this mean
we're in business again, Tallis?

770
01:09:20,781 --> 01:09:22,491
Figured I'd see you two again.

771
01:09:22,575 --> 01:09:24,869
We're going to hear that familiar sound again.

772
01:09:24,952 --> 01:09:26,704
The anvil ring of combat.

773
01:09:26,787 --> 01:09:28,873
That is what you were
trained for, Tallis.

774
01:09:28,956 --> 01:09:29,874
It's your birthright.

775
01:09:29,957 --> 01:09:31,876
It's what I was designed for.

776
01:09:31,959 --> 01:09:33,544
Ain't nothing on earth like the sound

777
01:09:33,627 --> 01:09:34,712
of an angry minigun, gentlemen.

778
01:09:34,795 --> 01:09:37,548
I am the tune that
rips through your night.

779
01:09:37,631 --> 01:09:39,592
I am the incubus, the heathen,

780
01:09:39,675 --> 01:09:41,385
the partisan of the battlefield.

781
01:09:41,468 --> 01:09:44,221
Give me oil that I might inflict some pain.

782
01:09:44,305 --> 01:09:45,973
Oh, brother! Ha ha!

783
01:10:24,678 --> 01:10:26,388
Ship-shape fighting order.

784
01:10:26,472 --> 01:10:29,266
I'm a mean, lean, fighting machine.

785
01:10:29,350 --> 01:10:33,896
My chosen specialty is taking
the lives of heathen drone police.

786
01:10:33,979 --> 01:10:36,398
I am the tune that
rips through your night.

787
01:10:36,482 --> 01:10:38,359
I am the incubus, the heathen,

788
01:10:38,442 --> 01:10:40,945
the partisan of the battlefield.

789
01:10:41,028 --> 01:10:43,948
Give me oil that I might inflict some pain.

790
01:10:44,031 --> 01:10:45,950
Oh, brother.

791
01:10:46,033 --> 01:10:48,285
Covert frequency engaging.

792
01:10:48,369 --> 01:10:50,621
Ultra blue faces
possible compromise.

793
01:10:50,704 --> 01:10:52,498
Deferring to ultra red.

794
01:10:52,581 --> 01:10:55,960
Interlacing Colonel Norton's
AI com-sat into our system, Tallis.

795
01:10:56,043 --> 01:10:57,586
To quote Sergeant Anchilles,

796
01:10:57,670 --> 01:10:59,588
it's better to go out with a bang

797
01:10:59,672 --> 01:11:00,965
than to fade away.

798
01:11:01,048 --> 01:11:02,967
I've rigged this structure
with RDX charges.

799
01:11:03,050 --> 01:11:05,386
They're set on ultra red frequency.

800
01:11:05,469 --> 01:11:07,972
Awaiting your next order, sir.

801
01:11:08,055 --> 01:11:10,307
When your position has
been compromised,

802
01:11:10,391 --> 01:11:14,979
wait until the last possible moment
before detonation.

803
01:11:15,062 --> 01:11:16,355
You'll be going with them, sir.

804
01:11:16,438 --> 01:11:18,691
Good luck, Colonel.

805
01:11:18,774 --> 01:11:19,984
Good luck, Colonel.

806
01:11:20,067 --> 01:11:23,362
The E-700th doesn't believe in luck.

807
01:11:28,742 --> 01:11:30,995
We were built to kill or be killed.

808
01:11:31,078 --> 01:11:34,081
It's time to do what
we do best, Tallis.

809
01:11:57,104 --> 01:11:58,647
Ready, Colonel.

810
01:11:58,731 --> 01:12:01,483
Stealth launch anti-personnel rockets,

811
01:12:01,567 --> 01:12:04,528
incendiary level three,
and good old H-E.

812
01:12:04,611 --> 01:12:06,363
High explosive barbeque time!

813
01:12:08,073 --> 01:12:11,243
"To imagine that it is possible
to perform great military deeds

814
01:12:11,327 --> 01:12:13,829
without fighting
is just empty dreams."

815
01:12:13,912 --> 01:12:14,955
Napoleon said that.

816
01:12:15,039 --> 01:12:17,124
Audio to stealth mode.

817
01:12:30,137 --> 01:12:31,263
How are we Iooking, Colonel?

818
01:12:31,305 --> 01:12:33,932
Engaging minigun.

819
01:12:34,016 --> 01:12:37,561
For St. Peter shall ride
into town on a chrome dragon.

820
01:12:37,644 --> 01:12:41,607
And that dragon, his name
is Puff the Magic Dragon.

821
01:12:41,690 --> 01:12:45,611
Damned be the wicked,
the evil-doers, too.

822
01:12:49,156 --> 01:12:50,074
In your own time, Colonel.

823
01:12:50,157 --> 01:12:51,909
Open fire.

824
01:12:51,992 --> 01:12:53,744
I hope you have some cover there, Tallis.

825
01:12:57,539 --> 01:13:00,167
I just sent in the four
horsemen of eternal damnation.

826
01:13:03,921 --> 01:13:06,465
The colonel shall punish
you unholy sinners!

827
01:13:25,442 --> 01:13:28,779
Look what I got by the authority
of God vested in me.

828
01:13:39,206 --> 01:13:42,918
St. Peter shall ride into town
on a chrome dragon!

829
01:13:44,545 --> 01:13:48,215
May the lord have mercy
on my wicked, wicked soul!

830
01:13:54,179 --> 01:13:55,597
This is it, Tallis.

831
01:13:55,681 --> 01:13:58,225
It's the drone relay station
we've been looking for.

832
01:14:01,687 --> 01:14:05,107
You're Tallis, of the EE-700.

833
01:14:05,190 --> 01:14:06,900
I know all about you.

834
01:14:06,984 --> 01:14:08,694
You're built around
the nanotechnology

835
01:14:08,777 --> 01:14:11,613
my company patented.

836
01:14:11,697 --> 01:14:14,241
Move away from that monitor
or you will be shot!

837
01:14:17,870 --> 01:14:19,997
She can't do that.

838
01:14:21,915 --> 01:14:24,835
This is bigger than both of us.

839
01:14:24,918 --> 01:14:27,629
This is the development
of artificial intelligence.

840
01:14:28,755 --> 01:14:30,007
The comprehension of justice.

841
01:14:30,090 --> 01:14:32,759
She's warning the drones, Tallis.

842
01:14:39,766 --> 01:14:41,518
Who are you?

843
01:14:41,602 --> 01:14:44,188
She ought not
have died this way.

844
01:14:44,271 --> 01:14:45,439
Disable the drones.

845
01:14:49,193 --> 01:14:51,695
You don't understand.

846
01:14:51,778 --> 01:14:54,198
We don't command the drone.

847
01:14:54,281 --> 01:14:55,616
The drone commands us.

848
01:14:55,699 --> 01:15:00,621
We worship the drone!

849
01:15:00,704 --> 01:15:06,376
We engineered them
to be perfect, infallible.

850
01:15:07,586 --> 01:15:11,882
They are human evolution.

851
01:15:11,965 --> 01:15:16,136
They are our religion.

852
01:15:16,220 --> 01:15:19,223
There are hundreds
of us working for them,

853
01:15:19,306 --> 01:15:21,141
but they don't need us--

854
01:15:21,225 --> 01:15:23,894
any of us-- anymore.

855
01:15:23,977 --> 01:15:26,563
See, they've evolved.

856
01:15:26,647 --> 01:15:29,650
Become truly self-governing.

857
01:15:29,733 --> 01:15:31,235
Without you...

858
01:15:31,318 --> 01:15:33,612
without this equipment...

859
01:15:33,695 --> 01:15:35,155
the patrolmen would stop?

860
01:15:35,239 --> 01:15:39,618
Our objective was the constitution

861
01:15:39,701 --> 01:15:42,079
of a peaceful world.

862
01:15:42,162 --> 01:15:44,581
A utopia.

863
01:15:44,665 --> 01:15:49,336
The realization
of the mythical nirvana.

864
01:16:01,431 --> 01:16:02,599
They must have known the drone

865
01:16:02,683 --> 01:16:03,976
would eventually kill them too.

866
01:16:04,059 --> 01:16:08,355
The human mind
is basically good, but so weak.

867
01:16:28,750 --> 01:16:31,003
Who are these guys?

868
01:16:31,086 --> 01:16:32,838
They aren't registering on my sensors.

869
01:16:32,921 --> 01:16:34,256
Must be a type-two model.

870
01:16:34,339 --> 01:16:35,966
All of that is classified.

871
01:16:54,067 --> 01:16:56,194
They were an advanced model
combat drone

872
01:16:56,278 --> 01:16:58,739
operating on
an ultra-low level frequency.

873
01:16:58,822 --> 01:17:00,824
That's covert military capability.

874
01:17:00,907 --> 01:17:03,910
I hope there are no more
of them, Tallis.

875
01:17:03,994 --> 01:17:06,330
Status on drone police force?

876
01:17:06,413 --> 01:17:08,832
I wish you could see
what I'm seeing, Tallis.

877
01:17:08,915 --> 01:17:10,167
Com-sat wide range.

878
01:17:10,250 --> 01:17:13,170
The drones are static,
operative status inactive.

879
01:17:13,253 --> 01:17:15,422
Without directives,
they're on ice, Tallis.

880
01:17:16,798 --> 01:17:18,425
That's for my family, you bum!

881
01:17:20,761 --> 01:17:22,346
That's it, kids. Kill them!

882
01:17:27,601 --> 01:17:29,311
They can't breathe without a command.

883
01:17:29,394 --> 01:17:31,229
Without the relay station,
the drones are powerless.

884
01:17:31,313 --> 01:17:32,648
They're literally suffocating.

885
01:17:32,731 --> 01:17:34,900
You saved the world, Tallis.

886
01:17:34,983 --> 01:17:36,860
What's left of it.

887
01:17:36,943 --> 01:17:38,362
Don't celebrate yet.

888
01:17:38,445 --> 01:17:41,448
Someone using an ultra-low frequency
is headed right for us.

889
01:17:42,824 --> 01:17:44,117
Drones.

890
01:18:20,987 --> 01:18:23,073
There's only eight
of them registering.

891
01:18:23,156 --> 01:18:24,825
Bad news, they don't die easy,

892
01:18:24,908 --> 01:18:27,411
but they do die.

893
01:18:27,494 --> 01:18:29,287
Three in pursuit,
trying to locate the others.

894
01:20:21,107 --> 01:20:24,027
Keep scanning, Angel.

895
01:20:24,110 --> 01:20:25,529
Scanning. Thermal.

896
01:20:25,612 --> 01:20:27,239
Doppler. lnfra red.

897
01:20:27,322 --> 01:20:28,865
Clear 360.

898
01:20:28,949 --> 01:20:31,076
Maintain a low body mass, Tallis.

899
01:20:31,159 --> 01:20:33,495
They're able to track us
regardless of the environment

900
01:20:33,578 --> 01:20:36,623
and they are much stronger
than the type one.

901
01:20:58,019 --> 01:21:00,564
Nothing. I'm showing
nothing at all.

902
01:21:00,647 --> 01:21:02,399
They've overruled my ECM.

903
01:21:02,482 --> 01:21:03,483
I'm sorry, Tallis.

904
01:21:05,151 --> 01:21:06,278
Can't lock target.

905
01:21:06,361 --> 01:21:08,363
Cannot initiate counter fire.

906
01:21:19,666 --> 01:21:21,084
They've gone to cover.

907
01:21:21,167 --> 01:21:22,586
We need to take the offensive.

908
01:21:22,669 --> 01:21:25,589
We will not survive
under these conditions.

909
01:21:25,672 --> 01:21:28,425
That's your last
quick clot patch, Tallis.

910
01:21:28,508 --> 01:21:30,176
It will take more
than shrimp protein

911
01:21:30,260 --> 01:21:33,013
to fix you if you lose this fight.

912
01:21:36,433 --> 01:21:38,977
They're one step ahead of me.

913
01:21:39,060 --> 01:21:40,353
I must be transmitting.

914
01:21:40,437 --> 01:21:41,605
The beacon in your Eye Cap

915
01:21:41,688 --> 01:21:43,481
transmits on a covert frequency.

916
01:21:43,565 --> 01:21:45,442
Tallis, they must have decoded it.

917
01:21:45,525 --> 01:21:47,152
They know everything.

918
01:21:47,235 --> 01:21:50,280
They used you to draw out
the human resistance fighters.

919
01:21:50,363 --> 01:21:53,116
Please be careful.

920
01:22:35,408 --> 01:22:36,618
Hey!

921
01:22:36,701 --> 01:22:37,744
Looking for me?

922
01:22:42,749 --> 01:22:46,002
Don't ever do that again, Tallis.

923
01:22:46,086 --> 01:22:47,671
Have you pinpointed
a reference yet?

924
01:22:47,754 --> 01:22:52,092
Atmosphere precipitation is affecting
my thermal imagery.

925
01:23:06,773 --> 01:23:08,525
I got to use the door!

926
01:23:08,608 --> 01:23:10,360
Negative. Use side window.

927
01:23:10,443 --> 01:23:11,695
Don't touch a thing.

928
01:23:11,778 --> 01:23:13,530
This is obsolete ordnance.

929
01:23:13,613 --> 01:23:15,365
The accelerator has degenerated.

930
01:23:15,448 --> 01:23:18,118
Tallis, it is very unstable.

931
01:23:37,053 --> 01:23:38,722
Scan, Angel.

932
01:23:38,805 --> 01:23:41,349
Running ultra-low frequency check.

933
01:23:41,433 --> 01:23:44,602
The tetrytol concussion has damaged
my surveillance system.

934
01:23:44,686 --> 01:23:46,980
Data indicates that we are alone.

935
01:23:47,063 --> 01:23:49,441
Please maintain extreme caution.

936
01:27:04,385 --> 01:27:06,221
You have killed
what can't be killed.

937
01:27:09,557 --> 01:27:12,352
We were so close.

938
01:27:12,435 --> 01:27:16,689
Our great task almost complete.

939
01:27:16,773 --> 01:27:18,149
You have destroyed it all.

940
01:27:18,233 --> 01:27:20,818
Your great task was murder.

941
01:27:20,902 --> 01:27:22,445
You were wrong.

942
01:27:22,528 --> 01:27:24,948
Look upon my murdered
family, soldier.

943
01:27:25,031 --> 01:27:28,243
Prepare to join them.

944
01:27:30,453 --> 01:27:34,374
If I live, the drone army lives.

945
01:27:34,457 --> 01:27:37,752
If I survive, we will rise again.

946
01:27:37,835 --> 01:27:39,963
I am hard-wired to rebuild.

947
01:27:40,046 --> 01:27:42,548
Programmed to regenerate.

948
01:27:42,632 --> 01:27:44,467
With minimal technology,

949
01:27:44,550 --> 01:27:46,803
I could replenish the EDP army.

950
01:27:48,012 --> 01:27:49,973
Join me, soldier.

951
01:27:50,056 --> 01:27:51,224
We can command an army

952
01:27:51,307 --> 01:27:54,644
the likes of which
you can only imagine.

953
01:27:54,727 --> 01:27:56,604
We're similar, you and I.

954
01:27:56,688 --> 01:27:58,648
Not like them.

955
01:28:00,733 --> 01:28:03,444
Drop your weapon.

956
01:28:03,528 --> 01:28:04,946
Join me.

957
01:28:07,782 --> 01:28:10,576
I don't think so.

958
01:29:07,133 --> 01:29:09,635
We were so close, Tallis.

959
01:29:27,904 --> 01:29:29,072
Purgatory.

960
01:29:29,155 --> 01:29:32,742
The place or state within
which the souls of sinners

961
01:29:32,825 --> 01:29:34,577
are subjected to purifying sufferings

962
01:29:34,660 --> 01:29:36,829
until, having paid their debt,

963
01:29:36,913 --> 01:29:40,500
only then are they worthy of paradise.

964
01:29:47,757 --> 01:29:50,843
I wouldn't call it paradise,
but it is home.

965
01:29:55,139 --> 01:30:00,645
You're easy to find, Tallis.

966
01:30:00,728 --> 01:30:03,689
I just go where all the shooting is.

967
01:30:08,736 --> 01:30:11,447
What happened to your eye?

968
01:30:16,202 --> 01:30:19,539
I'll live.

969
01:30:27,630 --> 01:30:30,466
That would be another sunrise, Tallis.

970
01:30:30,550 --> 01:30:33,636
It's a beautiful day to start rebuilding.
