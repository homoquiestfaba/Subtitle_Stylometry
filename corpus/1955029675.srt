344

It was a dream.

345
00:32:00,103 --> 00:32:02,272
Bad?

346
00:32:02,356 --> 00:32:04,816
Like the ones I used to have
about my mother,

347
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:06,818
just before she died.

348
00:32:06,902 --> 00:32:08,820
And?

349
00:32:11,656 --> 00:32:13,616
And it was about you.

350
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:18,120
Tell me.

351
00:32:19,830 --> 00:32:21,790
It was only a dream.

352

I won’t let this one become real.

357
00:32:49,399 --> 00:32:52,068
This baby will change our lives.

358
00:32:52,151 --> 00:32:55,071
I doubt the queen will continue to allow me
to serve in the senate.

359
00:32:55,154 --> 00:32:57,907
And if the council discovers
you’re the father, you’ll be expelled–

360
00:32:57,990 --> 00:33:00,535
I– I know. I know.

361
00:33:00,618 --> 00:33:04,330
Do you think Obi-Wan
might be able to help us?

362
00:33:06,332 --> 00:33:08,376
We don’t need his help.

363
00:33:09,668 --> 00:33:12,712
Our baby is a blessing.

364
00:33:28,895 --> 00:33:33,066
Premonitions? Premonitions. Hmm.

365

These visions you have–

366
00:33:36,403 --> 00:33:40,031
They’re of pain, suffering.

367
00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:43,869
Death.

368
00:33:43,952 --> 00:33:48,373
Yourself you speak of, or someone you know?

369
00:33:49,833 --> 00:33:51,877
Someone.

370
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:53,879
Close to you?

371
00:33:55,046 --> 00:33:57,299
Yes.

372
00:33:57,382 --> 00:34:01,261
Careful you must be
when sensing the future, Anakin.

373
00:34:01,344 --> 00:34:05,682
The fear of loss is a path to the dark side.

374
00:34:07,893 --> 00:34:11,188
I won’t let these visions
come true, Master Yoda.

375

Attachment leads to jealousy.

379

380

381
00:34:32,417 --> 00:34:35,504

I’m sorry. I was held up.

385
00:34:56,107 --> 00:34:59,694
- I have no excuse.
- In short, they are going very well.

386
00:34:59,778 --> 00:35:05,200
Saleucami has fallen, and Master Vos
has moved his troops to Boz Pity.

387
00:35:05,283 --> 00:35:07,327
What’s wrong, then?

388
00:35:08,911 --> 00:35:10,037
The senate is expected...

389
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:13,624
to vote more executive powers
to the chancellor today.

390
00:35:13,707 --> 00:35:18,087
Well, that can only mean less deliberating
and more action. Is that bad?

391
00:35:18,170 --> 00:35:20,631
It’ll make it easier for us to end this war.

392
00:35:22,341 --> 00:35:24,677
Be careful of your friend Palpatine.

393
00:35:26,303 --> 00:35:28,179

- He has requested your presence.
- What for?

395
00:35:31,057 --> 00:35:35,687
- He would not say.
- He didn’t inform the council?

396
00:35:35,812 --> 00:35:39,274
- That’s unusual, isn’t it?
- All ofthis is unusual.

397
00:35:39,357 --> 00:35:41,818
And it’s making me feel uneasy.

398
00:35:56,791 --> 00:35:58,710
I hope you trust me, Anakin.

399
00:35:58,793 --> 00:36:00,962
Of course.

I’m appointing you to be my personal
representative on the Jedi Council.

I’m overwhelmed, sir.

408
00:36:33,409 --> 00:36:36,537
But the council elects its own members.
They’ll never accept this.

409
00:36:36,621 --> 00:36:40,124

413

I understand.

Oh, calm down, Anakin.
You have been given a great honor.

The only reason the council
has approved your appointment...

551
00:46:44,287 --> 00:46:47,373
He had such a knowledge of the dark side,

552
00:46:47,457 --> 00:46:52,503
he could even keep the ones he cared about...

553
00:46:52,587 --> 00:46:54,505
from dying.

Which eventually, of course, he did.

562

Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice
everything he knew.
