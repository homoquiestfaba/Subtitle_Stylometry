1
00:01:24,567 --> 00:01:27,267
- Dad, are you awake?
- Yes.

2
00:01:27,267 --> 00:01:29,267
It's time to get up.
What do you think?

3
00:01:29,267 --> 00:01:32,133
- Is it breakfast time?
- Yes, it sure is.

4
00:01:32,133 --> 00:01:35,567
- Well--
- Better get up.

5
00:01:35,567 --> 00:01:37,501
I need a bite.

6
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,300
Need your glasses?

7
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:45,300
Yeah, on the
pillow there.

8
00:01:47,167 --> 00:01:49,100
Dad, I got your breakfast.

9
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:52,367
Good for you.
It looks delicious.

10
00:01:52,367 --> 00:01:55,033
Do you need anything else?
Piece of toast,
cup of coffee?

11
00:01:55,033 --> 00:01:57,067
No, I don't need no
coffee this morning.

12
00:01:57,067 --> 00:01:59,667
I think I'll do with
the orange juice.

13
00:01:59,667 --> 00:02:01,801
- If you need anything, yell.
- Thank you.

14
00:02:38,667 --> 00:02:40,300
[honks]

15
00:02:57,067 --> 00:02:59,167
- Good morning.
- Morning.

16
00:03:05,234 --> 00:03:07,501
So how's your mom
doing today?

17
00:03:07,501 --> 00:03:08,901
She's doing good.

18
00:03:08,901 --> 00:03:10,434
She working yet?

19
00:03:10,434 --> 00:03:12,834
No, she hasn't found anything.

20
00:03:18,667 --> 00:03:21,133
- Good morning.
- Hey, how are you doing today?

21
00:03:21,133 --> 00:03:23,968
- Good. How are you?
- Terrific.

22
00:03:23,968 --> 00:03:25,767
What can I help you
with this morning?

23
00:03:25,767 --> 00:03:28,067
I think I'll have...
a twister.

24
00:03:28,067 --> 00:03:30,567
- Okay. Is this
  for here or to go?
- It'll be for here.

25
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,467
I want to get
a picture.

26
00:03:39,133 --> 00:03:40,567
Okay.

27
00:03:40,567 --> 00:03:42,534
- 'Cause you're
  my bestest friend.
- Huh?

28
00:03:42,534 --> 00:03:47,000
You're my best friend,
and I just need to get
a picture of you.

29
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:54,100
Where do you want me
to stand?

30
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,033
Here's really good.

31
00:03:57,734 --> 00:04:01,767
It's almost too nice
to go in there,
you think?

32
00:04:01,767 --> 00:04:03,701
Yeah, let's go back.

33
00:04:03,701 --> 00:04:06,133
- I was talking to Judy
  yesterday.
- Yeah?

34
00:04:06,133 --> 00:04:09,868
She was telling me about
the huge order they have
coming in,

35
00:04:09,868 --> 00:04:12,634
which means we're really
gonna have to pump up
production.

36
00:04:12,634 --> 00:04:16,100
- That's great.
- That's what I thought.

37
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:18,167
We're already doing
too much as it is.

38
00:04:18,167 --> 00:04:20,234
I think so too.

39
00:04:20,234 --> 00:04:22,167
They need to get
some more help.

40
00:04:22,167 --> 00:04:25,200
- What do you think?
- Yeah.

41
00:04:37,634 --> 00:04:39,968
[machinery whirring]

42
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,868
So you think tonight
maybe you can give me a ride

43
00:06:32,868 --> 00:06:35,400
to my other job
at the shovel factory?

44
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,801
- You know I will.
- Yeah.

45
00:06:37,801 --> 00:06:41,067
I always told you
if you ever needed
a ride or anything,

46
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:43,634
all you had to do was ask.

47
00:06:43,634 --> 00:06:44,968
I appreciate it.

48
00:06:44,968 --> 00:06:46,534
No problem.

49
00:06:52,234 --> 00:06:55,501
You been out
on a date lately?

50
00:06:55,501 --> 00:06:57,234
No, not for a while.

51
00:06:57,234 --> 00:06:59,501
No prospects, huh?

52
00:06:59,501 --> 00:07:02,100
No. I've been busy
working pretty much.

53
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:06,033
I leave here and I only got
so much time before I have
to go to the other job, so...

54
00:07:06,033 --> 00:07:08,767
It's about like
the rest of us,
I'm telling you.

55
00:07:08,767 --> 00:07:11,767
Plus I gotta work nights,
so if I want to go out at night,

56
00:07:11,767 --> 00:07:15,067
I can't do that,
unless I have a day off, so--

57
00:07:15,067 --> 00:07:17,634
- I'm ready for the beaches.
- Yeah?

58
00:07:17,634 --> 00:07:19,634
- Yeah. I want to go to Aruba.
- Oh, yeah?

59
00:07:19,634 --> 00:07:23,434
I saw that on TV the other day.
The beaches are great.

60
00:07:23,434 --> 00:07:27,467
I think I'm about done.
How about you?

61
00:07:27,467 --> 00:07:29,868
Yeah. I'm gonna
go and smoke.

62
00:07:45,801 --> 00:07:48,000
You talk to
your dad lately?

63
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,334
Um, no, not since
the last time.

64
00:07:50,334 --> 00:07:54,133
It's probably...
six months ago.

65
00:07:54,133 --> 00:07:56,534
Where's he at now?

66
00:07:56,534 --> 00:08:00,400
Last I heard he was living
in Arizona, I think,

67
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,567
and, uh, I guess he got
remarried to someone.

68
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,200
I haven't heard
from him since.

69
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:07,467

77
00:10:06,434 --> 00:10:08,200
- Hi.
- Hey.

78
00:10:09,334 --> 00:10:10,734
How's work?

79
00:10:10,734 --> 00:10:13,434
It was all right.
How are you?

80
00:10:13,434 --> 00:10:16,133
I'm all right.
You hungry?

81
00:10:16,133 --> 00:10:18,868
Uh, no,
I don't think so.

82
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:20,934
- I'm just gonna go to bed.
- All right.

83
00:10:20,934 --> 00:10:23,100
- Good night.
- Good night.

84
00:11:53,734 --> 00:11:55,801
- You ready for your first day?
- Oh, yeah.

85
00:11:55,801 --> 00:11:58,267
- Not nervous or anything?
- No. I'm fine.

86
00:11:58,267 --> 00:12:00,467
Okay, that's great.

87
00:12:00,467 --> 00:12:03,767
So tell me again,
do you have airbrush experience?

88
00:12:03,767 --> 00:12:06,367
Yeah. I used to airbrush
T-shirts at the mall.

89
00:12:06,367 --> 00:12:09,968
Great. When you were doing that,
were you working with
other airbrushers,

90
00:12:09,968 --> 00:12:13,968
or were you just
waiting on the customers?

91
00:12:13,968 --> 00:12:17,167
No. I just worked by myself.
They would bring me
what I needed,

92
00:12:17,167 --> 00:12:19,534
bring me the orders,
and I would take care of it.

93
00:12:19,534 --> 00:12:22,434
Okay, well,
that's really good.
We'll see what happens.

94
00:12:22,434 --> 00:12:23,901
Good morning,
everybody.

95
00:12:23,901 --> 00:12:27,167
I know you guys are all aware of
the big order that we've got in,

96
00:12:27,167 --> 00:12:29,167
and we've been working hard
to get it done,

97
00:12:29,167 --> 00:12:31,367
but we feel like you guys
need some help.

98
00:12:31,367 --> 00:12:33,601
And so here she is.
Her name is Rose.

99
00:12:33,601 --> 00:12:35,434
We were very fortunate
to find Rose

100
00:12:35,434 --> 00:12:37,767
in the fact that she has
airbrush experience.

101
00:12:37,767 --> 00:12:42,267
She's worked with stencils
before, so she'll be working
in the head-painting area.

102
00:12:42,267 --> 00:12:45,534
I'm sure she'll have questions
throughout the day,
so please help her.

103
00:12:45,534 --> 00:12:47,601
I found Rose,
when we were interviewing her, 

104
00:12:47,601 --> 00:12:51,234
to be very sweet
and the consummate team player,

105
00:12:51,234 --> 00:12:55,100
so I think she'll
fit in really well
with our workforce here.

106
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:58,367
So I'll let you guys
introduce her through
the course of the day,

107
00:12:58,367 --> 00:13:02,267
and, um, please help her out
with anything that she needs.

108
00:13:03,734 --> 00:13:04,801
Get to work.

109
00:14:10,968 --> 00:14:12,801
[airbrush hissing]

110
00:14:16,701 --> 00:14:20,133
You know you got to
double-glue those before
you put 'em in the box, right?

111
00:14:20,133 --> 00:14:22,234
Yes, I'm aware of that.

112
00:14:40,133 --> 00:14:42,300
So do either
of you smoke?

113
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:43,701
- I don't.
- Yeah, I smoke.

114
00:14:43,701 --> 00:14:46,000
- Do you?
- Mm-hmm.

115
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,767
Well, when you're done,
if you want to,
we can go grab a cigarette.

116
00:14:48,767 --> 00:14:50,601
- Sure.
- Okay.

117
00:14:50,601 --> 00:14:52,801
Where did you used to work?

118
00:14:52,801 --> 00:14:55,100
I used to work
at a nursing home.

119
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:57,801
And what'd you do there?

120
00:14:57,801 --> 00:15:01,400
I was a professional
ass-wiper.

121
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,968
You know, the bottom,
the CNA.

122
00:15:03,968 --> 00:15:07,133
The one that everybody
comes to when something
dirty needs done

123
00:15:07,133 --> 00:15:09,334
is basically what I did.

124
00:15:11,534 --> 00:15:15,634
I took care of people,
the people who can't do
for themselves anymore,

125
00:15:15,634 --> 00:15:18,234
you have to do everything
that they can't do:

126
00:15:18,234 --> 00:15:21,033
shower them, dress them,
feed them.

127
00:15:21,033 --> 00:15:24,133
Just depends on who you have,
what you have to do.

128
00:15:24,133 --> 00:15:28,534
It's a hard job
that you really, really
have to be dedicated to.

129
00:15:28,534 --> 00:15:33,133
You really have to like
what you're doing
or you just can't.

130
00:15:33,133 --> 00:15:36,133
'Cause there's, like,
days you go in there
and it's just--

131
00:15:36,133 --> 00:15:39,300
You just want to turn
around and walk out,
it's that bad.

132
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:42,133
This isn't as hard
of work, but...

133
00:15:42,133 --> 00:15:45,300
I don't think I'm gonna
like this much better.

134
00:15:46,767 --> 00:15:49,033
And what about you?

135
00:15:49,033 --> 00:15:51,501
What was
the question?

136
00:15:51,501 --> 00:15:54,067
Where did you work
before you came here?

137
00:15:54,067 --> 00:15:57,767
I used to work maintenance
in an old factory.

138
00:15:59,968 --> 00:16:02,467
- That's cool.
- Mmm.

139
00:16:04,367 --> 00:16:07,200
I'm very ready
to get out of this area.

140
00:16:10,834 --> 00:16:13,234
Why is that?

141
00:16:13,234 --> 00:16:15,801
'Cause there's
nothing here.

142
00:16:15,801 --> 00:16:17,334
Mm-hmm.

143
00:16:17,334 --> 00:16:19,701
I'm living in this
little apartment
with my daughter.

144
00:16:19,701 --> 00:16:21,267
She's two.

145
00:16:21,267 --> 00:16:24,567
You can't make money
in this area.
It's just poor.

146
00:16:24,567 --> 00:16:26,400
Everything's poor.

147
00:16:30,968 --> 00:16:32,767
Are you married?

148
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:35,634
No, I'm not married.

149
00:16:35,634 --> 00:16:37,901
I thought I would be, 

150
00:16:37,901 --> 00:16:42,200
but things don't always
work out like you think
they're going to.

151
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,467
You know.

152
00:16:44,467 --> 00:16:46,934
Just another
bad decision.

153
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,234
Yeah.

154
00:16:58,634 --> 00:17:00,701
What are you doing
right after work today?

155
00:17:00,701 --> 00:17:04,300
Well, I probably have to...

156
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:06,367
get home and see my dad.

157
00:17:06,367 --> 00:17:09,801
- Do you think you might
be able to give me a ride?
- I don't see why not.

158
00:17:09,801 --> 00:17:13,133
I have another job
that I have to be at
like right after,

159
00:17:13,133 --> 00:17:14,834
but it's not
that far from here.

160
00:17:14,834 --> 00:17:16,534
Okay.

161
00:17:16,534 --> 00:17:18,667
I'd really
appreciate it.

162
00:17:19,868 --> 00:17:21,400
No problem.

163
00:17:24,968 --> 00:17:27,801
Are you about done?

164
00:17:27,801 --> 00:17:29,667
Yeah, think so.

165
00:17:33,734 --> 00:17:35,901
[Rose] I guess we're gonna
go have a cigarette,

166
00:17:35,901 --> 00:17:38,200
and we'll see you back up
there in a little bit.

167
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,868
Okay.

168
00:17:43,801 --> 00:17:45,200
Ready?

169
00:19:17,534 --> 00:19:19,033
Rose?

170
00:19:22,901 --> 00:19:24,400
Where are you?

171
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,334
I'm in the bathroom.

172
00:19:40,968 --> 00:19:44,434
Oh, my God, Rose!
What are you doing?

173
00:19:44,434 --> 00:19:46,067
I'm taking a bath.

174
00:19:49,234 --> 00:19:51,501
Do you do this
all the time?

175
00:19:51,501 --> 00:19:54,067
No, not all the time.

176
00:19:54,067 --> 00:19:56,200
Remember when I told you
I worked in a nursing home?

177
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,868
I sure did.

178
00:19:57,868 --> 00:20:02,167
I got hit in the back
with a tray table
by this little old man.

179
00:20:02,167 --> 00:20:05,267
And it messed up my back.
I couldn't pick Jesse up
for like a month.

180
00:20:05,267 --> 00:20:09,567
But every once in a while
my muscles will contract,
and I get really sore.

181
00:20:09,567 --> 00:20:11,534
And this feels
really good.

182
00:20:11,534 --> 00:20:13,534
And my apartment
has no bathtub.

183
00:20:13,534 --> 00:20:16,767
It just has a shower,
so I take advantage.

184
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:20,033
But I clean it when I'm done.
I clean after I bathe.

185
00:20:20,033 --> 00:20:21,767
- Okay.
- [giggles]

186
00:20:21,767 --> 00:20:23,734
I was kind of wondering.

187
00:20:23,734 --> 00:20:25,901
I didn't know what would happen
if we'd get caught.

188
00:20:25,901 --> 00:20:28,901
No. She won't be here
for a long time.

189
00:20:28,901 --> 00:20:31,567
Oh, my gosh!

190
00:20:31,567 --> 00:20:35,634
I mean, every room
was the size of
my whole living room.

191
00:20:35,634 --> 00:20:36,901
The bedrooms--

192
00:20:36,901 --> 00:20:41,133
You could fit my whole house
in two rooms in that house.

193
00:20:41,133 --> 00:20:43,834
I could not believe it.
Gorgeous!

194
00:20:43,834 --> 00:20:47,400
Chandeliers coming down
out of the ceiling.

195
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,801
- It was unreal.
- Hmm.

196
00:20:49,801 --> 00:20:52,634
I mean, just fabulous,
fabulous, fabulous.

197
00:20:52,634 --> 00:20:56,734
And then... you are not
gonna believe this.

198
00:20:56,734 --> 00:21:01,801
She tells me how particular
this lady is.

199
00:21:01,801 --> 00:21:06,033
And then she invites me
inside of this house
that she's cleaning.

200
00:21:06,033 --> 00:21:07,367
Guess what.

201
00:21:07,367 --> 00:21:10,934
She was in
the Jacuzzi bathtub--

202
00:21:10,934 --> 00:21:13,767
I am not kidding--
taking a bath.

203
00:21:13,767 --> 00:21:16,467
- She was supposed to be
  cleaning it?
- Yes!

204
00:21:16,467 --> 00:21:18,501
- Got sidetracked.
- I'm not kidding.

205
00:21:18,501 --> 00:21:21,234
I couldn't believe it.
I thought I was gonna die.

206
00:21:21,234 --> 00:21:24,734
All I could think about
was that lady coming home
and catching--

207
00:21:24,734 --> 00:21:27,400
You know, here I am,
not supposed to be there,

208
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,167
in there checking
her house out,

209
00:21:29,167 --> 00:21:31,100
and there's Rose
in the tub.

210
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:35,067
And you know,
I thought, "Wow."

211
00:21:35,067 --> 00:21:38,100
Yeah, I'd be afraid of 'em
just coming home too early.

212
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:41,067
I'm not too sure
about her.

213
00:21:41,067 --> 00:21:43,100
- Yeah?
- What do you think?

214
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:45,334
I don't know.
She seems fine to me.

215
00:21:45,334 --> 00:21:47,400
- You think so?
- Yeah.

216
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:50,567
She scares me a little.

217
00:21:50,567 --> 00:21:51,667
Hmm.

218
00:23:12,267 --> 00:23:14,300
[air hissing]

219
00:23:22,701 --> 00:23:26,067
I was working at a restaurant,
and they work day and night.

220
00:23:26,067 --> 00:23:27,934
Turn two different shifts.

221
00:23:27,934 --> 00:23:31,100
I just didn't have anybody
to care for him.

222
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:34,934
It was really rough,
and I didn't want to have
to put him in a nursing home.

223
00:23:34,934 --> 00:23:37,000
- The expense for that is huge.
- Yeah, those places--

224
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,100
And you don't want to do that
unless you absolutely have to.

225
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:41,601
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

226
00:23:41,601 --> 00:23:43,434
Because a lot of times
they're understaffed

227
00:23:43,434 --> 00:23:46,367
or they don't have all the
equipment that they need.

228
00:23:46,367 --> 00:23:49,100
You know, you get people in
there that shouldn't be there,

229
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:51,868
that should be in other
facilities, that are violent.

230
00:23:51,868 --> 00:23:54,534
You know, you just, you never
know what you're gonna get.

231
00:23:54,534 --> 00:23:57,601
You don't know who they're gonna
put in the room with 'em.

232
00:23:57,601 --> 00:23:59,534
You know,
because it's not...

233
00:24:01,434 --> 00:24:06,400
The way that they put people
together is not necessarily
by what their sickness may be,

234
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:10,033
like, you know, put two stroke
patients in the same room.

235
00:24:10,033 --> 00:24:14,100
Some people might be bedridden,
and some people might be up
walking around.

236
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:16,868
And they get into each other's
things and tear stuff up.

237
00:24:16,868 --> 00:24:18,567
- Oh, wow.
- Yeah.

238
00:24:18,567 --> 00:24:20,667
- Glad I didn't do that.
- No.

239
00:24:20,667 --> 00:24:22,434
And as far as, like,
management,

240
00:24:22,434 --> 00:24:25,667
they're so tight that
what they'll do is take--

241
00:24:25,667 --> 00:24:28,868
You know, you might clock
out, but if they see you
walking across the parking lot,

242
00:24:28,868 --> 00:24:32,968
they'll be like, "Can you come
just for a minute and come
help with this or that?"

243
00:24:32,968 --> 00:24:36,334
And you end up staying over
an hour or better.

244
00:24:36,334 --> 00:24:38,267
And that happens
three or four days a week.

245
00:24:38,267 --> 00:24:40,033
So you don't even get paid.

246
00:24:40,033 --> 00:24:42,467
But you need your job,
so what do you say?

247
00:24:42,467 --> 00:24:44,434
- Yeah.
- You're kind of st--

248
00:24:44,434 --> 00:24:47,634
You don't want to make
anybody mad, you know.

249
00:24:47,634 --> 00:24:50,100
- And they do it to everybody.
- Oh, really?

250
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:54,434
So everybody kind of
just did it, you know?

251
00:24:54,434 --> 00:24:58,400
[woman] Wow. I can't imagine
them doing that here.

252
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,501
We're gonna make quota
and get some of that bonus.

253
00:25:00,501 --> 00:25:03,968
- Did you guys hear about that?
- No, I haven't heard anything.

254
00:25:03,968 --> 00:25:08,400
Yeah, we're gonna get probably
about $50 if we meet quota
at the end of the week.

255
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,334
I thought
that was great.

256
00:25:10,334 --> 00:25:11,934
That's awfully
nice of 'em.

257
00:25:11,934 --> 00:25:15,300
Yeah, that'll
help me out a lot
with bills and things.

258
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:18,167
That's what
you'd spend it on
if you got it?

259
00:25:24,534 --> 00:25:26,400
I probably will just--

260
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,033
I don't know.

261
00:25:29,234 --> 00:25:31,467
I haven't really
thought about it.

262
00:25:31,467 --> 00:25:33,868
What do you think
you'll spend yours on?

263
00:25:33,868 --> 00:25:36,067
I don't know.
If the weather
keeps getting nice,

264
00:25:36,067 --> 00:25:39,167
I'll get camping equipment
or something like that.

265
00:25:39,167 --> 00:25:42,234
- Oh, that sounds like fun.
- Mm-hmm.

266
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:48,367
Well, if you're looking
to make a little bit
of extra money,

267
00:25:48,367 --> 00:25:50,300
I was wanting to go out
this weekend.

268
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:54,234
If you want to baby-sit Jesse
for a few hours,

269
00:25:54,234 --> 00:25:56,634
I couldn't pay a whole lot,
but I could give you
a little bit.

270
00:25:56,634 --> 00:25:59,868
- What night?
- Friday night.

271
00:25:59,868 --> 00:26:03,200
If that would
work out for you.

272
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,667
Sure. I think I could
do that for you.

273
00:26:05,667 --> 00:26:06,834
- Could you?
- Yeah.

274
00:26:06,834 --> 00:26:09,067
- She's really good.
- How old is she?

275
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:11,567
- She's two.
- Okay.

276
00:26:11,567 --> 00:26:15,934
It'll be nice for her too,
'cause it'll give her
somebody else to be around.

277
00:26:15,934 --> 00:26:18,968
She doesn't-- She's not around
too many other people.

278
00:26:18,968 --> 00:26:20,834
[woman]
What's she like to do?

279
00:26:20,834 --> 00:26:23,701
[Rose] She likes to color
and she likes to read books.

280
00:26:23,701 --> 00:26:25,067
[woman]
Okay.

281
00:26:25,067 --> 00:26:28,834
Yeah, and she goes to bed
at 8:00, so more than likely--

282
00:26:28,834 --> 00:26:31,601
That's great, 'cause
that way I can sew after--

283
00:26:31,601 --> 00:26:34,834
- Oh, yeah.
- That's good, that's good.

284
00:26:34,834 --> 00:26:38,667
- Okay, no problem.
- Great. I'm excited now.

285
00:26:47,534 --> 00:26:49,367
Are you about done?

286
00:26:49,367 --> 00:26:50,734
Yeah, pretty much.

287
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:52,968
- Wanna have a smoke?
- Sure.

288
00:27:45,334 --> 00:27:49,701
Now, you know I
probably won't be home
till about 11:00,

289
00:27:49,701 --> 00:27:53,467
and I left a number hanging
on the refrigerator
if you need me.

290
00:27:53,467 --> 00:27:56,133
- I was wondering if
  you left me a number.
- Yeah, I sure did.

291
00:27:56,133 --> 00:27:59,167
- If I need to get ahold of you.
- Yes, I did.

292
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:13,334
[Rose] So she should be going
to bed in about a half an hour,
usually about 8:00.

293
00:28:13,334 --> 00:28:16,167
About 15 minutes before
you put her to bed,

294
00:28:16,167 --> 00:28:18,834
just give her a few goldfish
crackers and some juice,

295
00:28:18,834 --> 00:28:21,767
just enough to put
something in her stomach.

296
00:28:21,767 --> 00:28:25,601
But she should be all right.
She may cry whenever I leave.

297
00:28:25,601 --> 00:28:28,400
- Just kind of expect it.
- Okay.

298
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,868
All you have to do is lay her
down and just read her a book,

299
00:28:30,868 --> 00:28:34,801
and she'll get her blanket,
suck her thumb
and she'll be done.

300
00:28:34,801 --> 00:28:37,801
All right. 
That sounds great.

301
00:28:37,801 --> 00:28:39,868
She's pretty easy.

302
00:28:39,868 --> 00:28:41,801
[gurgling]

303
00:28:41,801 --> 00:28:44,667
Hey, sweetie,
what do you have there?

304
00:28:44,667 --> 00:28:45,801
[knocking]

305
00:28:45,801 --> 00:28:49,400
[gasps]
Who's here?

306
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,868
Who's here?

307
00:28:50,868 --> 00:28:52,634
Watch out.

308
00:28:55,767 --> 00:28:58,300
- Hey, come in.
- Hey, come in.

309
00:28:58,300 --> 00:28:59,567
Hello.

310
00:29:00,767 --> 00:29:01,767
Come here, sweetie.

311
00:29:03,033 --> 00:29:04,734
Who's the man?

312
00:29:04,734 --> 00:29:07,501
- What are you doing?
- Oh, nothing.

313
00:29:07,501 --> 00:29:10,868
[Jesse jabbering]

314
00:29:13,601 --> 00:29:17,901
- So, this is your date?
- Yeah.

315
00:29:17,901 --> 00:29:20,167
Oh.

316
00:29:20,167 --> 00:29:22,934
We're going out tonight
for a little bit.

317
00:29:22,934 --> 00:29:25,968
And, uh, who's driving?

318
00:29:25,968 --> 00:29:30,234
I am. I borrowed a--
I borrowed a car
off my friend.

319
00:29:30,234 --> 00:29:32,334
Oh.

320
00:29:32,334 --> 00:29:35,100
He let me take it out
tonight.

321
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:37,100
I see.

322
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:40,434
Can I have a kiss?

323
00:29:40,434 --> 00:29:43,334
Mommy's gonna go
for a little bit.
Are you gonna be okay?

324
00:29:43,334 --> 00:29:45,601
- No!
- Yes, you will.

325
00:29:45,601 --> 00:29:49,400
- I want my baby!
- Okay, you get your baby.

326
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:53,067
- I guess we're gonna go and--
- Okay.

327
00:29:53,067 --> 00:29:55,601
- What's that?
- It's another baby.

328
00:29:55,601 --> 00:29:58,133
You can take that baby
and go night-night with it.

329
00:29:58,133 --> 00:30:02,000
- Love you.
- Mama, I wanna go with you.

330
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,200
No. You're gonna
stay here with Martha.

331
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,100
Yeah. You're gonna have fun.

332
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:09,701
- Come here, sweetie.
- No!

333
00:30:09,701 --> 00:30:11,901
We'll read a story.
Would you like to
read a story?

334
00:30:11,901 --> 00:30:16,834
- No!
- I see a really nice book.

335
00:30:16,834 --> 00:30:19,501
Look! She's got a book.
and she's gonna read to you.

336
00:30:19,501 --> 00:30:22,767
- No!
- I'll be back in a little bit.

337
00:30:22,767 --> 00:30:27,634
- Here, give me a kiss.
- No! I want to go that way!

338
00:30:27,634 --> 00:30:29,601
You might want
to get her now.

339
00:30:29,601 --> 00:30:32,367
I go that way!
[crying]

340
00:30:32,367 --> 00:30:33,868
- Come here, sweetie.
- No!

341
00:30:33,868 --> 00:30:38,200
- Do you want to play
  with some toys?
- No!

342
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:40,901
- Well, come on.
- No!

343
00:30:40,901 --> 00:30:42,067
Oh, sweetie.

344
00:30:47,801 --> 00:30:51,667
Yeah, but seriously,
it seems like every time
I think I'm saving a little bit,

345
00:30:51,667 --> 00:30:54,334
getting a little bit ahead,
something comes up.

346
00:30:54,334 --> 00:30:57,167
- Jesse gets sick.
- Yeah.

347
00:30:57,167 --> 00:30:59,167
Have you been able
to save much?

348
00:30:59,167 --> 00:31:02,567
A little bit. I don't have
a checking account
or anything, but...

349
00:31:02,567 --> 00:31:04,767
I got drawer change
I've been saving.

350
00:31:04,767 --> 00:31:07,667
- Drawer change, huh?
- Yeah.

351
00:31:07,667 --> 00:31:09,667
Yeah, he's got
his own place,

352
00:31:09,667 --> 00:31:13,000
and then Jesse and I
live together.

353
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,100
Yeah, he wasn't ready
for our baby.

354
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:18,934
He's an artist,
and he's very into his work
and what's going on with him.

355
00:31:18,934 --> 00:31:21,868
He doesn't have time, you know,
for anybody else.

356
00:31:21,868 --> 00:31:23,534
But he helps out with her.

357
00:31:23,534 --> 00:31:27,667
He baby-sits while I work
sometimes, if he has time,
or whatever.

358
00:31:27,667 --> 00:31:31,400
That's good.
At least he sticks around
a little bit and sees her.

359
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:35,133
Yeah.
He makes an effort.

360
00:31:37,033 --> 00:31:39,601
So did you finish
high school?

361
00:31:39,601 --> 00:31:44,567
No. Actually, I had anxiety,
and I ended up quitting.

362
00:31:44,567 --> 00:31:46,167
What is that?

363
00:31:46,167 --> 00:31:49,334
Oh, just when I got around
a lot of people, you know,

364
00:31:49,334 --> 00:31:52,567
I'd get a little bit nervous
and sometimes I'd have
a panic attack.

365
00:31:52,567 --> 00:31:55,133
- Really?
- Yeah.

366
00:31:55,133 --> 00:31:58,968
It was pretty bad,
enough to quit.

367
00:31:58,968 --> 00:32:02,167
Did you go to a doctor
or anything for that?

368
00:32:02,167 --> 00:32:04,267
Um...

369
00:32:04,267 --> 00:32:06,033
Yeah, I did at one point,

370
00:32:06,033 --> 00:32:09,567
but they just kept prescribing
me pills that didn't work,

371
00:32:09,567 --> 00:32:11,834
so I eventually
just quit going

372
00:32:11,834 --> 00:32:14,200
and dealt with it myself,
you know?

373
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:16,934
There's not much
you can do about it, so--

374
00:32:16,934 --> 00:32:19,000
Are you taking anything
right now?

375
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,868
- No.
- No?

376
00:32:21,868 --> 00:32:25,133
And how do you do?
Does that bother you anymore?

377
00:32:25,133 --> 00:32:26,767
It's not as bad now,
you know.

378
00:32:26,767 --> 00:32:30,601
Usually, the places I go,
there's not 400 people
like school.

379
00:32:30,601 --> 00:32:32,033
Yeah.

380
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:34,634
It's usually when
there's a lot of people.

381
00:32:34,634 --> 00:32:37,467
Lately, it's only temporary
when it's bad.

382
00:32:37,467 --> 00:32:38,701
Mm-hmm.

383
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:42,901
Did you finish high school?

384
00:32:42,901 --> 00:32:45,200
No, I didn't finish.

385
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,601
What happened there?

386
00:32:46,601 --> 00:32:48,601
I got rebellious
in high school.

387
00:32:48,601 --> 00:32:50,667
- Oh, yeah?
- Oh, yeah.

388
00:32:50,667 --> 00:32:55,234
Yeah, I ran away,
hitchhiked to Charleston.

389
00:32:55,234 --> 00:32:57,601
- Yeah.
- How old were you then?

390
00:32:57,601 --> 00:33:00,367
- Fifteen.
- Kind of dangerous, isn't it?

391
00:33:00,367 --> 00:33:03,467
Yeah, a little bit.

392
00:33:03,467 --> 00:33:05,567
It was fun at the time.

393
00:33:05,567 --> 00:33:07,801
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

394
00:33:10,868 --> 00:33:12,234
And look now.

395
00:33:16,667 --> 00:33:19,067
- I'd like to save up
  and get a car.
- Oh, yeah.

396
00:33:19,067 --> 00:33:21,634
- That's nice to have.
- Yeah.

397
00:33:25,067 --> 00:33:26,968
So where do you live?

398
00:33:26,968 --> 00:33:30,634
- I live with my mom right now.
- Oh, really?

399
00:33:30,634 --> 00:33:33,868
Yeah. It's just
a matter of money, really.

400
00:33:33,868 --> 00:33:36,634
Trying to save up.
It's the easiest way to do it.

401
00:33:36,634 --> 00:33:40,133
Yeah, I hear you.

402
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:52,033
Is your mom home
right now?

403
00:33:52,033 --> 00:33:54,367
Well, actually,
I don't know.

404
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,534
Well, would you rather
just like maybe
go back there

405
00:34:00,534 --> 00:34:03,601
where there's not
so many people?

406
00:34:03,601 --> 00:34:05,767
Well, I guess we could, yeah.

407
00:34:05,767 --> 00:34:06,934
Okay.

408
00:34:16,367 --> 00:34:21,334
Those are very pretty.
Your mom must like jewelry.

409
00:34:21,334 --> 00:34:23,167
Yeah.

410
00:34:23,167 --> 00:34:25,267
Look at that.

411
00:34:25,267 --> 00:34:26,667
- It's pretty.
- Yeah.

412
00:34:26,667 --> 00:34:28,067
Oh, we lost it.

413
00:34:28,067 --> 00:34:30,934
- It's a giraffe.
- A giraffe. Oh, okay.

414
00:34:30,934 --> 00:34:33,400
It looks like a dinosaur
a little bit.

415
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:37,100
- It's a giraffe-dinosaur.
- Yeah.

416
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:38,467
What's this?

417
00:34:38,467 --> 00:34:40,901
A purple necklace.

418
00:34:40,901 --> 00:34:43,767
- Is that a purple necklace?
- Yeah.

419
00:34:43,767 --> 00:34:46,968
[baby talk]

420
00:34:46,968 --> 00:34:48,934
Yeah.

421
00:35:07,801 --> 00:35:09,934
- Hey.
- Hi.

422
00:35:09,934 --> 00:35:11,934
- Hi.
- Hi.

423
00:35:11,934 --> 00:35:13,567
Mom, this is Rose.

424
00:35:13,567 --> 00:35:16,567
- Hi, Rose. What's up?
- It's nice to meet you.

425
00:35:16,567 --> 00:35:19,601
Yeah, it's nice to meet you too.
What are you guys doing?

426
00:35:19,601 --> 00:35:23,701
Nothing. This is the girl
that they hired at
the factory the other day.

427
00:35:23,701 --> 00:35:26,567
- Hi. Kyle told me about you.
- Oh, really?

428
00:35:26,567 --> 00:35:29,434
Yeah, he did.
So how do you like it there?

429
00:35:29,434 --> 00:35:31,167
It's pretty good.
It's not too bad.

430
00:35:31,167 --> 00:35:33,167
It's busy but,
you know, it's a job.

431
00:35:33,167 --> 00:35:35,567
Yeah, jobs really
get that way.

432
00:35:35,567 --> 00:35:37,634
You guys wanna watch this?
It's pretty good.

433
00:35:37,634 --> 00:35:41,033
No. I think we're just gonna
go hang out in the bedroom
for a little bit.

434
00:35:41,033 --> 00:35:43,467
- Okay.
- All right.

435
00:35:43,467 --> 00:35:45,834
- Okay.
- [laughs]

436
00:35:48,501 --> 00:35:50,834
- See you later.
- Bye.

437
00:35:57,133 --> 00:36:01,000
This is a pretty interesting
room you have.

438
00:36:05,133 --> 00:36:06,968
What's that picture of?

439
00:36:06,968 --> 00:36:10,968
That's a tattoo.
My friend drew it
for me there.

440
00:36:10,968 --> 00:36:14,367
He does tattoos
and stuff.

441
00:36:14,367 --> 00:36:16,234
That is crazy-looking.

442
00:36:16,234 --> 00:36:18,567
Yeah, it's pretty cool.
I like it.

443
00:36:19,667 --> 00:36:20,934
Do you have any tattoos?

444
00:36:20,934 --> 00:36:24,767
Yeah, I got two tattoos
on my arm here.

445
00:36:24,767 --> 00:36:27,667
No kidding.

446
00:36:27,667 --> 00:36:29,367
Are they
exactly the same?

447
00:36:29,367 --> 00:36:31,834
Yeah. They're symmetrical.

448
00:36:35,701 --> 00:36:37,968
That's cool.
Are you gonna get any more?

449
00:36:37,968 --> 00:36:41,934
Yeah, I'll probably
end up getting up to
about here or so.

450
00:36:41,934 --> 00:36:44,634
He'll probably come up with
something good I can put on.

451
00:36:44,634 --> 00:36:48,267
A friend of mine in Marietta
did one on my back.

452
00:36:48,267 --> 00:36:49,734
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

453
00:36:49,734 --> 00:36:51,767
I'm not ready
for another one though.

454
00:36:51,767 --> 00:36:53,367
Did it hurt or anything?

455
00:36:53,367 --> 00:36:55,200
No, it didn't hurt.

456
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,767
I'm just, I don't know
what else I want
that's like forever.

457
00:36:57,767 --> 00:36:59,400
- Yeah.
- You know.

458
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,334
Oh, yeah.
It's definitely permanent.

459
00:37:01,334 --> 00:37:05,334
Oh, yeah. Do you like
hanging out in tattoo shops?

460
00:37:05,334 --> 00:37:08,367
Yeah. I got a couple friends
that are tattoo artists.

461
00:37:08,367 --> 00:37:11,601
Yeah, it is fun.
You meet a lot of people.

462
00:37:11,601 --> 00:37:13,501
Yeah.

463
00:37:13,501 --> 00:37:16,434
Wow. That's a nice watch.
Where'd you get that?

464
00:37:16,434 --> 00:37:17,868
Thank you.

465
00:37:17,868 --> 00:37:20,734
It was a gift from someone.
I used to clean their house.

466
00:37:20,734 --> 00:37:23,200
Oh, yeah?
Kind of like a tip?

467
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,868
- Yeah, like a big thank-you.
- That's nice of them.

468
00:37:25,868 --> 00:37:28,701
Yeah, it was
very nice of them.

469
00:37:31,667 --> 00:37:34,734
I see you've got
a lot of <i>High Times</i> stuff.
Do you smoke?

470
00:37:34,734 --> 00:37:36,033
Yeah, I'm a smoker.

471
00:37:36,033 --> 00:37:37,868
Oh, yeah? I figured.

472
00:37:37,868 --> 00:37:39,200
Yeah, I'm a smoker.

473
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,100
[laughs]

474
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:43,234
Would your mom get mad
if we smoked in here?

475
00:37:43,234 --> 00:37:48,501
Um, I think I can make it
so she won't know.

476
00:37:48,501 --> 00:37:51,501
Yeah. I just don't want her
prying in.

477
00:37:51,501 --> 00:37:53,033
Right, yeah.

478
00:37:53,033 --> 00:37:54,834
Yeah, I think we can
get away with it.

479
00:37:54,834 --> 00:37:57,367
That's cool.

480
00:37:57,367 --> 00:38:00,000
Do you, uh,
want a drink or anything?

481
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,167
You know, that would be good.
Do you have any beer?

482
00:38:02,167 --> 00:38:03,767
Yeah, I got a beer.

483
00:38:03,767 --> 00:38:05,167
I'll be right back.

484
00:38:08,834 --> 00:38:10,834
[TV playing]

485
00:38:43,634 --> 00:38:46,033
- Thank you very much.
- Mm-hmm.

486
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:59,601
- Oh, man.
- What?

487
00:38:59,601 --> 00:39:02,701
It's starting to get
kind of late. I'm gonna
have to get back to Jesse.

488
00:39:02,701 --> 00:39:05,801
I told Martha we'd only be
a few hours, but...

489
00:39:05,801 --> 00:39:10,300
I'll just let you have this,
and you can save it for another
time or later, whatever.

490
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:13,334
Okay. I'm sure I'll
save it for another time.

491
00:39:13,334 --> 00:39:16,567
We can hang out and drink
a beer, and then we're
gonna have to take off.

492
00:39:16,567 --> 00:39:19,667
All right, that's cool.

493
00:39:19,667 --> 00:39:25,100
So I don't think
I wanna go back in there
because of Martha and all.

494
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:26,868
What about Martha?

495
00:39:26,868 --> 00:39:29,701
I don't know.
She gave me a weird vibe
when I was in there earlier

496
00:39:29,701 --> 00:39:31,701
like she was mad at me
or something.

497
00:39:31,701 --> 00:39:33,100
For going out with me?

498
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:35,434
I don't know.
It could be anything.

499
00:39:35,434 --> 00:39:38,901
She just gave me a weird vibe
when I was in there earlier.

500
00:39:38,901 --> 00:39:43,000
Okay, that's fine.
I did have fun with you though.

501
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:48,901
Yeah, I did too.
Definitely have
to do it again.

502
00:39:48,901 --> 00:39:51,067
Well, just, you know,
get ahold of me.

503
00:39:51,067 --> 00:39:54,000
- Yeah, all right.
- I'll see you at work Monday.

504
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,534
- Okay. Talk to you later.
- Bye.

505
00:40:23,601 --> 00:40:26,067
So how was your date?

506
00:40:26,067 --> 00:40:28,067
Oh, it was all right.

507
00:40:28,067 --> 00:40:30,367
I really wish you guys
would've told me.

508
00:40:30,367 --> 00:40:32,400
Told you what?

509
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,767
That you guys were
going out together.

510
00:40:34,767 --> 00:40:36,767
- Why?
- Well, you could've told--

511
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:41,801
- I felt like an idiot.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

512
00:40:41,801 --> 00:40:43,567
- How was Jesse?
- Jesse was great.

513
00:40:43,567 --> 00:40:45,467
Was she? Did you have
a good time with her?

514
00:40:45,467 --> 00:40:47,334
Yeah. She really likes
those necklaces.

515
00:40:47,334 --> 00:40:50,434
Yeah, she does.
She's something.

516
00:40:50,434 --> 00:40:54,501
Sure is. She went to bed
about like what you said.

517
00:40:54,501 --> 00:40:57,901
Had her juice and her crackers
and went up to bed.

518
00:40:57,901 --> 00:41:00,200
[knocking]

519
00:41:03,534 --> 00:41:05,868
- Hey, guess what.
- Hey.

520
00:41:07,234 --> 00:41:09,634
Guess what happened
at my house.

521
00:41:09,634 --> 00:41:11,901
- [door closes]
- What do you want?

522
00:41:11,901 --> 00:41:14,267
Uh, a little bit of money,

523
00:41:14,267 --> 00:41:17,133
a bag of herb...

524
00:41:17,133 --> 00:41:18,801
and the truth.

525
00:41:18,801 --> 00:41:20,434
That's about it.

526
00:41:20,434 --> 00:41:23,968
- I don't know what
  you're talking about.
- Okay, cool. Exactly.

527
00:41:23,968 --> 00:41:27,167
- What?
- All the shit that's
  missing from my house.

528
00:41:27,167 --> 00:41:30,534
- Where the fuck is it?
- I was out.

529
00:41:30,534 --> 00:41:35,200
- I wasn't at your house.
- Yeah, I noticed. He's cute.

530
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:39,234
- He is none of your business.
- Okay, then take his money.

531
00:41:39,234 --> 00:41:42,300
- Don't come in my house,
  in my face--
- Then don't come in my house!

532
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:46,767
I didn't go in your house
and take your shit, okay?

533
00:41:46,767 --> 00:41:49,200
I don't have anything of yours.

534
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:53,400
You have my car, that you
like to drive around town,
that you're so happy with.

535
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:56,200
- I need the damn car, okay?
- You don't think I need it?

536
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:57,968
I take Jesse around,
I take her out shopping,

537
00:41:57,968 --> 00:42:00,601
buying her fucking Happy Meals,
all that good shit.

538
00:42:00,601 --> 00:42:02,667
But I can't do it
without my damn money.

539
00:42:02,667 --> 00:42:04,801
- I don't have your money.
- Okay--

540
00:42:04,801 --> 00:42:07,501
I don't have your
fucking money, Jake!

541
00:42:07,501 --> 00:42:09,834
It's not here.
You can look around.
There's no money.

542
00:42:09,834 --> 00:42:12,367
I have no money,
and I have no weed.

543
00:42:12,367 --> 00:42:15,033
- You're childish.
- You are such a fucking baby.

544
00:42:15,033 --> 00:42:19,100
It's all about Jake.
What Jake wants,
what Jake needs.

545
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:22,167
- I don't have your shit!
- I need my money.

546
00:42:22,167 --> 00:42:26,300
- Go sell some of your shit
  and make some money.
- It's the stupid principle!

547
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:29,000
Principle of what?
You coming into my house,

548
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:32,200
banging on my door
late at night,
accusing me of shit?

549
00:42:34,334 --> 00:42:36,367
You need to pick my shit
off the floor.

550
00:42:36,367 --> 00:42:38,200
Pick it up
and give me my money.

551
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:41,667
Unless you spent it all.
At least did you spend it
on Jesse?

552
00:42:41,667 --> 00:42:44,100
- Huh? Did did you
  buy her some clothes?
- Get out of my house.

553
00:42:45,667 --> 00:42:47,267
Oh, excuse me.

554
00:42:52,267 --> 00:42:54,367
- Was that Jesse's daddy?
- You know what?

555
00:42:54,367 --> 00:42:57,601
Martha, please, just
mind your own business, okay?

556
00:42:57,601 --> 00:42:59,334
Read your book.

557
00:43:38,834 --> 00:43:41,634
[TV playing]

558
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:03,934
Hello, Sergeant.
Detective Taylor.

559
00:44:03,934 --> 00:44:05,767
- Sgt. Davis.
- What do we got?

560
00:44:05,767 --> 00:44:08,634
We got a phone call at 6:45
from a neighbor

561
00:44:08,634 --> 00:44:11,901
stating that a child
had been crying
all night long.

562
00:44:11,901 --> 00:44:15,634
She couldn't get anybody
to answer the door,
so she called 911.

563
00:44:15,634 --> 00:44:17,601
We responded, made entry.

564
00:44:17,601 --> 00:44:21,167
Once inside, we found
a 23-year-old female
on the living room floor

565
00:44:21,167 --> 00:44:23,467
by the name
of Rose Hilliard.

566
00:44:23,467 --> 00:44:25,534
Okay.
Any sign of forced entry?

567
00:44:25,534 --> 00:44:27,934
- No sign. 
- Any sign of robbery?

568
00:44:27,934 --> 00:44:29,734
Doesn't appear to be.

569
00:44:29,734 --> 00:44:33,534
- What about a struggle?
- Appears to be a struggle, yes.

570
00:44:33,534 --> 00:44:35,701
- Let's go and take a look.
- Okay.

571
00:44:40,634 --> 00:44:42,334
Dad, I've got your breakfast.

572
00:44:42,334 --> 00:44:44,934
Well, how nice of you.

573
00:44:44,934 --> 00:44:46,734
What are we having,
cereal this morning?

574
00:44:46,734 --> 00:44:48,334
Yeah. Cereal and some juice.

575
00:44:57,267 --> 00:45:02,033
Well, you're right, Sarge.
There's no sign of forced
entry into the apartment.

576
00:45:02,033 --> 00:45:06,501
Doesn't look like a robbery.
Her valuables and her purse
are still here.

577
00:45:10,133 --> 00:45:14,200
She's got bruising to the neck,
which is consistent with
manual strangulation.

578
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:16,534
She's got petechiae
hemorrhage of the eyes.

579
00:45:16,534 --> 00:45:18,968
- Where's the baby?
- Baby's with the grandmother.

580
00:45:18,968 --> 00:45:21,000
- So the baby's safe?
- Yes.

581
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
Ross, when you're doing
the fingerprints,

582
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:27,000
I want you to process
the bruising on her neck
for prints.

583
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,701
Okay, sir.

584
00:45:28,701 --> 00:45:31,367
What did we find out from
the neighborhood canvass?

585
00:45:31,367 --> 00:45:33,167
Officer Smeeks?

586
00:45:36,868 --> 00:45:38,801
You wanna fill the detective
in on what you know?

587
00:45:38,801 --> 00:45:42,200
Okay. Now, I spoke to
three of the neighbors.

588
00:45:50,367 --> 00:45:54,267
Hey, Mom, you didn't
happen to pick up any
money in my room, did you?

589
00:45:54,267 --> 00:45:57,167
No, I didn't.
I haven't been in your room.

590
00:45:57,167 --> 00:45:59,467
- Didn't see in your room.
- All right.

591
00:45:59,467 --> 00:46:01,467
Maybe you spent more than
you thought you did.

592
00:46:01,467 --> 00:46:06,133
I had a little bit saved up,
so I might have misplaced it
or something.

593
00:46:06,133 --> 00:46:09,033
I was checking if you were
in there and picked it up.

594
00:46:09,033 --> 00:46:12,167
No, haven't been in there.
Haven't seen it.

595
00:46:12,167 --> 00:46:13,601
Was it a lot of money?

596
00:46:13,601 --> 00:46:16,167
No, just a little
I had saved up
for an emergency.

597
00:46:31,801 --> 00:46:36,167
This is a ring that
my mother had given me.

598
00:46:36,167 --> 00:46:39,434
When I turned 30,
she said I'd be responsible
enough to take care of it.

599
00:46:39,434 --> 00:46:41,334
Okay, so it's pretty
sentimental, huh?

600
00:46:41,334 --> 00:46:44,834
Yeah, it is, and this is
my grandmother's broach,

601
00:46:44,834 --> 00:46:46,901
and that was handed down
through the family,

602
00:46:46,901 --> 00:46:50,601
and my mother thought
she had gotten that, 
but I got it.

603
00:46:50,601 --> 00:46:52,501
You'll never guess
where this came from.

604
00:46:52,501 --> 00:46:53,601
Where's that?

605
00:46:53,601 --> 00:46:56,167
I found this in the park
with a metal detector.

606
00:46:56,167 --> 00:46:59,234
- Oh, wow. Nice find.
- I thought that was
  pretty good.

607
00:47:17,567 --> 00:47:20,767
Jake? I'm Det. Taylor
from the police department.

608
00:47:20,767 --> 00:47:23,234
I need to talk to you
for a minute. Can I come in?

609
00:47:23,234 --> 00:47:25,167
Uh, is it necessary?

610
00:47:25,167 --> 00:47:26,767
It's kind of important.

611
00:47:26,767 --> 00:47:29,834
It's about Rose Hilliard.
I need to talk to you about her.

612
00:47:29,834 --> 00:47:31,868
All right, man.
Come on in.

613
00:47:33,467 --> 00:47:35,634
Right through this door.

614
00:47:35,634 --> 00:47:40,234
- Did you do this on the walls?
- Yeah, yeah, most of it.

615
00:47:40,234 --> 00:47:41,601
Very interesting.

616
00:47:41,601 --> 00:47:43,367
Some would say.

617
00:47:43,367 --> 00:47:44,934
How long have you known Rose?

618
00:47:44,934 --> 00:47:48,400
Oh, man, I've known her
for a while, like...

619
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:52,567
We were together for at least
a year and a half.

620
00:47:52,567 --> 00:47:55,868
Probably altogether,
I guess five years,
somewhere around there.

621
00:47:55,868 --> 00:47:58,934
Okay. I guess you share
a child together?

622
00:47:58,934 --> 00:48:01,801
- Yeah.
- What's your daughter's name?

623
00:48:01,801 --> 00:48:03,567
- Jesse.
- Okay.

624
00:48:03,567 --> 00:48:06,234
So when was the last time
you saw Rose?

625
00:48:06,234 --> 00:48:08,701
Oh, man. Uh....

626
00:48:08,701 --> 00:48:11,534
- What day is today?
- Saturday.

627
00:48:11,534 --> 00:48:13,934
Uh, just last night.

628
00:48:13,934 --> 00:48:16,367
- So it was last night
  you were over there?
- Yeah, yeah, Friday night.

629
00:48:16,367 --> 00:48:18,834
Do you remember
about what time that was?

630
00:48:18,834 --> 00:48:21,033
Like 11 something.

631
00:48:21,033 --> 00:48:23,834
It was later, man,
like she was coming
from a date.

632
00:48:23,834 --> 00:48:26,667
Why did you go over there?

633
00:48:26,667 --> 00:48:31,300
Because, man, she's ignorant,
and she stole money of mine.

634
00:48:31,300 --> 00:48:34,400
- Did you get to talk to her?
- Yeah, I talked to her.

635
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:36,801
Was there anybody else
there at the house
when you were there?

636
00:48:36,801 --> 00:48:40,167
Uh, I remember she had
some chick on the couch.

637
00:48:40,167 --> 00:48:42,767
Do you know
who that person was?

638
00:48:42,767 --> 00:48:44,467
No, not a clue.

639
00:48:44,467 --> 00:48:46,801
Okay.
What did she look like?

640
00:48:48,467 --> 00:48:51,234
Uh, looked like
a person on a couch, man.
I don't know.

641
00:48:51,234 --> 00:48:53,634
- So you didn't pay
  much attention to her?
- No, man.

642
00:48:53,634 --> 00:48:57,234
Okay. Did you confront Rose
about her taking money from you?

643
00:48:57,234 --> 00:48:59,367
- Hell yeah.
- Did you get into an argument?

644
00:48:59,367 --> 00:49:02,067
Uh...

645
00:49:02,067 --> 00:49:05,367
I don't know.
That's just kind of
how we talk nowadays.

646
00:49:05,367 --> 00:49:06,968
- Just tell me--
- Yeah, yeah, man!

647
00:49:06,968 --> 00:49:08,801
She took my money.
I wanted my money back.

648
00:49:08,801 --> 00:49:10,267
Okay.

649
00:49:10,267 --> 00:49:12,267
She wasn't about
to give it to me,

650
00:49:12,267 --> 00:49:15,300
or just even
give me satisfaction
of admitting she did it.

651
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:17,267
Did you guys get into
a screaming match?

652
00:49:17,267 --> 00:49:20,767
No, man. The kid was
sleeping upstairs.

653
00:49:20,767 --> 00:49:22,100
So what happened?

654
00:49:22,100 --> 00:49:24,801
Uh... We...

655
00:49:24,801 --> 00:49:27,167
I went in and asked her,
"Where's my money?"

656
00:49:27,167 --> 00:49:32,100
Like usual, she told me,
"I don't have it.
I didn't take it."

657
00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:34,901
She said, "Get the hell
out of my house," and I left.

658
00:49:34,901 --> 00:49:37,400
Do you have any idea
why I'm here?

659
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:38,467
No, man.

660
00:49:38,467 --> 00:49:41,100
Rose was murdered.

661
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:43,567
Whoa. Okay.

662
00:49:43,567 --> 00:49:45,567
Do you have any knowledge
about who did that?

663
00:49:45,567 --> 00:49:48,267
No, not me.
I know that much.

664
00:49:48,267 --> 00:49:52,267
From looking around your
apartment, I can tell you're
a very passionate individual.

665
00:49:52,267 --> 00:49:53,934
- Artistic and passionate.
- [laughs]

666
00:49:53,934 --> 00:49:56,067
Not passionate to beat
her ass or anything,

667
00:49:56,067 --> 00:49:58,501
otherwise you probably
would've heard of me
a long time ago.

668
00:49:58,501 --> 00:50:00,501
You've never been physical
with her in the past?

669
00:50:00,501 --> 00:50:02,334
No, man, not really.

670
00:50:02,334 --> 00:50:04,767
So when you left,
she was alive and
everything was fine?

671
00:50:04,767 --> 00:50:07,100
Well, I wouldn't say
everything was fine,

672
00:50:07,100 --> 00:50:10,868
but she seemed to breathe
and speak and move about.

673
00:50:10,868 --> 00:50:15,300
So while you were there,
you didn't get into any kind of
physical altercation with her.

674
00:50:15,300 --> 00:50:17,300
No, man! So you're--
She's dead?

675
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:20,200
She's dead.

676
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:21,767
Wow, man.

677
00:50:23,567 --> 00:50:26,634
Wow. I need--
I need to call
some people, man.

678
00:50:26,634 --> 00:50:28,567
I need to see
my daughter.

679
00:50:41,133 --> 00:50:44,534
The darker the water,
the darker the bait,

680
00:50:44,534 --> 00:50:47,133
which doesn't
make any sense at all, 

681
00:50:47,133 --> 00:50:51,767
but if the water you're
going to be fishing in
is real clear,

682
00:50:51,767 --> 00:50:53,534
you'll want
the lighter colors.

683
00:50:53,534 --> 00:50:57,133
...for the spinner rates,
and they lock down.

684
00:50:57,133 --> 00:51:00,767
And then there's little boxes
that you can put
whatever you please.

685
00:51:00,767 --> 00:51:04,467
Hey, that is nice.
And how much does this run?

686
00:51:04,467 --> 00:51:05,934
$18.95.

687
00:51:17,267 --> 00:51:18,801
[knocking]

688
00:51:18,801 --> 00:51:21,400
- Kyle?
- Yeah.

689
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:23,267
I think you better
come out here.

690
00:51:23,267 --> 00:51:25,501
- Somebody wants to see you.
- All right.

691
00:51:25,501 --> 00:51:26,667
It's a cop.

692
00:51:33,467 --> 00:51:35,467
How long
have you known Rose?

693
00:51:35,467 --> 00:51:37,801
Oh, probably about
a week now.

694
00:51:37,801 --> 00:51:40,567
Okay, and what's
your relationship with her?

695
00:51:40,567 --> 00:51:43,801
Well, we worked together,
and we were friends.

696
00:51:43,801 --> 00:51:48,000
Uh, you know,
we just met, so--

697
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:51,601
- When was the last time
  you saw Rose?
- I was with her last night.

698
00:51:51,601 --> 00:51:53,534
Okay. What did you guys do?

699
00:51:53,534 --> 00:51:56,501
We went out
for a couple beers,

700
00:51:56,501 --> 00:51:59,267
and we came back here
for a little bit,

701
00:51:59,267 --> 00:52:01,767
then I took her home.

702
00:52:01,767 --> 00:52:03,968
Was anybody else
with you last night?

703
00:52:03,968 --> 00:52:06,000
- No.
- Okay.

704
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:09,133
About what time did you
drop her off home last night?

705
00:52:09,133 --> 00:52:11,567
It was probably
around 11:00.

706
00:52:11,567 --> 00:52:14,167
Okay. During the time
that you were together,

707
00:52:14,167 --> 00:52:19,067
did she express any concerns
that someone might want
to hurt her?

708
00:52:19,067 --> 00:52:21,067
[Kyle's mother]
Something happen to her?

709
00:52:21,067 --> 00:52:23,467
Yeah. She was murdered
last night.

710
00:52:24,968 --> 00:52:27,434
- What?
- She was murdered.

711
00:52:27,434 --> 00:52:30,467
- Where?
- At her home.

712
00:52:30,467 --> 00:52:32,601
Do you know of anybody
that would want to hurt her?

713
00:52:32,601 --> 00:52:36,067
No. She didn't
say anything.

714
00:52:37,801 --> 00:52:41,234
When you say you picked her--
What time did you pick
her up last night?

715
00:52:41,234 --> 00:52:45,467
Um, it was probably
about 7:00. 6:00 or 7:00.

716
00:52:45,467 --> 00:52:48,901
Did you go into her house
when you stopped to pick her up?

717
00:52:48,901 --> 00:52:49,968
Yeah, I went in.

718
00:52:49,968 --> 00:52:51,634
Was there anybody else there?

719
00:52:51,634 --> 00:52:54,400
Yeah. Martha was there.
She was babysitting for her.

720
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:55,634
Who's Martha?

721
00:52:55,634 --> 00:53:00,067
She's another girl
I work with.

722
00:53:00,067 --> 00:53:02,000
Does she have red hair?

723
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,334
Yeah.

724
00:53:15,334 --> 00:53:18,968
[Martha] And then I also
sew some doll clothes.

725
00:53:20,334 --> 00:53:21,734
You do what?

726
00:53:21,734 --> 00:53:24,934
I sew doll clothes
in the evenings
for the dolls.

727
00:53:24,934 --> 00:53:26,567
- Really?
- Yeah.

728
00:53:26,567 --> 00:53:29,167
It's a lot of fun.

729
00:53:29,167 --> 00:53:31,133
You do that with anybody
or just by yourself?

730
00:53:31,133 --> 00:53:32,868
Just by myself.

731
00:53:32,868 --> 00:53:36,534
My dad's at home,
and that way I just
spend some time with him.

732
00:53:36,534 --> 00:53:38,901
He usually watches TV
while I sew.

733
00:53:38,901 --> 00:53:39,901
[chuckles]

734
00:54:09,467 --> 00:54:11,367
- Hi.
- Hi.

735
00:54:11,367 --> 00:54:13,601
Is Kyle here?

736
00:54:13,601 --> 00:54:17,000
- Yeah.
- Care if I come in?

737
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,167
- Come on in.
- How you doing?

738
00:54:19,167 --> 00:54:21,300
I'm okay.
How are you doing?

739
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:23,400
Terrific.

740
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:25,767
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

741
00:54:25,767 --> 00:54:27,300
Okay.

742
00:54:32,033 --> 00:54:34,200
That's nice.

743
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:36,501
Hang on. I'll get Kyle.

744
00:54:36,501 --> 00:54:38,901
Kyle, Martha's here.

745
00:54:38,901 --> 00:54:41,200
- Oh.
- I don't know.

746
00:54:42,734 --> 00:54:45,267
- Hi. What are you doing?
- Hey, Martha.

747
00:54:45,267 --> 00:54:49,033
- I've been trying
  to get ahold of you.
- I've been out all day.

748
00:54:49,033 --> 00:54:52,100
I went to the beauty parlor and
went and bought a couple things.

749
00:54:52,100 --> 00:54:54,934
- Has anybody talked to you yet?
- About what?

750
00:54:54,934 --> 00:54:56,934
About Rose.

751
00:54:56,934 --> 00:54:59,033
What about Rose?

752
00:54:59,033 --> 00:55:01,901
She was killed
last night.

753
00:55:01,901 --> 00:55:06,200
She was murdered last night.
She was strangled.

754
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:07,501
- No.
- Yes.

755
00:55:07,501 --> 00:55:10,067
- Last night?
- Yeah.

756
00:55:10,067 --> 00:55:11,200
Oh, my God.

757
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:13,467
[mother] There was
a detective here today.

758
00:55:13,467 --> 00:55:15,767
[Martha]
You have got to be kidding me.

759
00:55:15,767 --> 00:55:19,834
Yeah. He just came in today
and told us.

760
00:55:19,834 --> 00:55:21,534
He asked me
a bunch of questions.

761
00:55:21,534 --> 00:55:23,100
And this happened
last night.

762
00:55:23,100 --> 00:55:25,634
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

763
00:55:25,634 --> 00:55:29,734
Yeah, they were asking me
because they thought I was
the last one that seen her.

764
00:55:29,734 --> 00:55:33,100
- Then I told him you were--
- Well, you brought her home
  when I was there.

765
00:55:33,100 --> 00:55:34,167
Yeah.

766
00:55:34,167 --> 00:55:36,868
You are not gonna
believe this.

767
00:55:36,868 --> 00:55:42,000
When I was there last night
after you dropped her off,

768
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:45,267
this guy started
beating on the door,

769
00:55:45,267 --> 00:55:50,567
and she goes to the door
and she opens it up,
and he comes in.

770
00:55:50,567 --> 00:55:53,234
He came in
screaming and yelling.

771
00:55:53,234 --> 00:55:55,968
She was okay when you left.
I mean, she was by herself.

772
00:55:55,968 --> 00:55:59,234
She was fine, yeah.
When I left, she was fine.

773
00:55:59,234 --> 00:56:04,234
But if he was waiting out there
when you dropped her off,

774
00:56:04,234 --> 00:56:06,667
he was probably
waiting on me to leave.

775
00:56:06,667 --> 00:56:08,701
- Yeah.
- And he went back in there.

776
00:56:08,701 --> 00:56:10,634
Oh, my God.

777
00:56:12,334 --> 00:56:15,000
I can't even imagine.

778
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:18,133
I know.
It happened too fast.

779
00:56:18,133 --> 00:56:19,968
I know.

780
00:56:19,968 --> 00:56:22,701
Well, I got these
for you.

781
00:56:22,701 --> 00:56:25,100
Oh, well, thank you.

782
00:56:26,868 --> 00:56:28,133
Thank you, Martha.

783
00:56:28,133 --> 00:56:29,834
You're quite welcome.

784
00:56:29,834 --> 00:56:32,667
Yeah, definitely,
you have to call
this detective too.

785
00:56:32,667 --> 00:56:34,801
Oh, I will. You'll have to
give me the number.

786
00:56:34,801 --> 00:56:39,067
[police scanner]

787
00:57:19,267 --> 00:57:21,434
- Hi. How you doin'?
- Hello, Martha.

788
00:57:21,434 --> 00:57:23,434
I'm Det. Taylor from
the police department.

789
00:57:23,434 --> 00:57:25,901
I need to talk to you about
Rose Hilliard. Can I come in?

790
00:57:25,901 --> 00:57:28,367
Oh, sure. Come on in.

791
00:57:28,367 --> 00:57:30,801
I heard from Kyle today,
and he was telling me

792
00:57:30,801 --> 00:57:34,100
that something horrible
had happened to Rose,
that she'd been murdered.

793
00:57:34,100 --> 00:57:37,300
- Can I come in and have a seat?
- Sure. This is my father.

794
00:57:37,300 --> 00:57:40,267
Sir, I'm from the police
department. I was just here
to talk to your daughter.

795
00:57:40,267 --> 00:57:42,234
- Pleased to meet you.
- Pleased to meet you, sir.

796
00:57:42,234 --> 00:57:46,200
I mean, at first I thought
she was a really sweet girl.

797
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:48,434
And then the longer
you get to know her, 

798
00:57:48,434 --> 00:57:53,000
the pushier she gets and
the more favors she asks for.

799
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:56,267
I mean, it was just one favor
right after the other one.

800
00:57:56,267 --> 00:57:58,734
Did you feel like she
took advantage of you?

801
00:57:58,734 --> 00:58:00,334
A little bit, yeah.

802
00:58:00,334 --> 00:58:02,534
Did she do that
to other people?

803
00:58:02,534 --> 00:58:06,133
I'm not really sure.
It seemed like she
picked on me a lot.

804
00:58:06,133 --> 00:58:10,000
She didn't really buddy up
with the other employees.

805
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,534
She'd only been there a week.

806
00:58:12,534 --> 00:58:15,234
Well, in talking with
the witnesses in the area,

807
00:58:15,234 --> 00:58:18,968
they indicate that you were
the last one that was seen
leaving the residence.

808
00:58:20,033 --> 00:58:23,100
[Martha]
Well, I-I know that--

809
00:58:23,100 --> 00:58:25,701
Well, I-I don't know.
I probably was.

810
00:58:25,701 --> 00:58:27,968
I left after he did.

811
00:58:27,968 --> 00:58:31,367
And that fact that, as far as
the investigation is concerned,

812
00:58:31,367 --> 00:58:34,567
you were the last one that
we know that saw her alive.

813
00:58:34,567 --> 00:58:36,000
Okay.

814
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,300
At some point, I would like
to get fingerprints from you

815
00:58:38,300 --> 00:58:41,334
to be able to compare
to evidence that we
collected at the scene.

816
00:58:41,334 --> 00:58:43,400
Well, you know my fingerprints
are gonna be there.

817
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:44,601
I was there.

818
00:58:44,601 --> 00:58:47,000
Right, but there's other
evidence that we have

819
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,934
- that would only be
  the killer's.
- Okay.

820
00:58:49,934 --> 00:58:52,534
Would you be willing to come
to the police department tonight

821
00:58:52,534 --> 00:58:53,934
and give me
a set of fingerprints?

822
00:58:53,934 --> 00:58:59,000
Okay. I would have to get
someone to take care of my dad.

823
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
And about how long
will that take?

824
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:02,567
Shouldn't take
more than 15, 20 minutes

825
00:59:02,567 --> 00:59:04,634
- to get the fingerprints.
- Okay.

826
00:59:04,634 --> 00:59:07,267
If you'd be able to do it
tonight, it'd really help
with the investigation.

827
00:59:07,267 --> 00:59:09,801
I'll do anything I can to help.

828
01:00:04,033 --> 01:00:07,133
- Hello, Martha.
- Detective.

829
01:00:07,133 --> 01:00:09,734
Thanks for meeting
with me again.

830
01:00:09,734 --> 01:00:12,901
I just got a few more questions
that we need to talk about,

831
01:00:12,901 --> 01:00:14,901
- if that's okay.
- Okay.

832
01:00:14,901 --> 01:00:17,367
Do you care if I record
our conversation?

833
01:00:17,367 --> 01:00:19,067
- No.
- Okay.

834
01:00:19,067 --> 01:00:22,534
I'll just go ahead
and start the tape.

835
01:00:22,534 --> 01:00:26,868
What I like for you to do
is go over the events again
with me of Friday night. 

836
01:00:26,868 --> 01:00:29,567
Do you remember about what time
Kyle came to the house?

837
01:00:29,567 --> 01:00:30,601
No, I don't.

838
01:00:30,601 --> 01:00:32,601
Okay.
Did Kyle come inside?

839
01:00:32,601 --> 01:00:33,868
Yes, he did.

840
01:00:33,868 --> 01:00:36,000
And did he stay
very long?

841
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:37,901
No. They, uh...

842
01:00:39,801 --> 01:00:43,000
They talked a little bit,
and, um...

843
01:00:45,734 --> 01:00:47,367
They weren't there very long. 

844
01:00:47,367 --> 01:00:50,267
- Do you know where they went?
- No, I don't.

845
01:00:50,267 --> 01:00:54,334
Okay, so when they left,
it was just you
and the small child.

846
01:00:54,334 --> 01:00:58,067
- Yes.
- And what did you do
  that evening?

847
01:00:58,067 --> 01:00:59,767
The child and I just played,

848
01:00:59,767 --> 01:01:03,534
and then I watched some TV
and read some books

849
01:01:03,534 --> 01:01:08,667
and gave her some juice,
and she went right to sleep. 

850
01:01:08,667 --> 01:01:12,934
Rose had told me that it
wouldn't take her very long,
and she was very good.

851
01:01:12,934 --> 01:01:15,267
Okay. Nothing unusual
happened then?

852
01:01:15,267 --> 01:01:17,801
- No.
- What time did Rose come home?

853
01:01:17,801 --> 01:01:21,033
It was close to 11:00.

854
01:01:21,033 --> 01:01:24,634
Okay, and did you
immediately leave or--

855
01:01:24,634 --> 01:01:29,701
No. When she came in,
we sat down and she
asked me how Jesse was,

856
01:01:29,701 --> 01:01:32,701
and I asked her
about her date.

857
01:01:32,701 --> 01:01:34,567
And, uh...

858
01:01:34,567 --> 01:01:39,200
Then, of course,
that man came to the door.

859
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:41,434
Yeah, you told me
that an individual came.

860
01:01:41,434 --> 01:01:42,767
- Yes.
- It was her ex-boyfriend?

861
01:01:42,767 --> 01:01:44,033
Right. He had been--

862
01:01:44,033 --> 01:01:49,567
I guess he had been sitting
outside waiting on her.

863
01:01:49,567 --> 01:01:52,501
- And did they argue?
- Yes, they sure did.

864
01:01:52,501 --> 01:01:54,501
You told me that they had
gotten into an argument.

865
01:01:54,501 --> 01:01:57,667
Again, tell me
what that was about.

866
01:01:57,667 --> 01:02:01,200
He had said that she had stole
some things from the apartment

867
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:04,901
and some money.

868
01:02:04,901 --> 01:02:09,434
How did it end with them?
Did it turn physical?

869
01:02:09,434 --> 01:02:12,667
Well, there was
a lot of yelling and...

870
01:02:14,200 --> 01:02:17,901
I'm not sure
whether he shoved her,

871
01:02:17,901 --> 01:02:21,300
but I know she had
grabbed ahold of him
to try to get him out the door. 

872
01:02:21,300 --> 01:02:24,400
Was she able to get him
out of the house?

873
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:26,767
It took awhile. 

874
01:02:26,767 --> 01:02:31,033
Okay. But he did
ultimately leave
the apartment.

875
01:02:31,033 --> 01:02:32,501
Yes. Yes, he did. 

876
01:02:32,501 --> 01:02:35,467
Did you see him any more
that night?

877
01:02:35,467 --> 01:02:37,934
No. I didn't--

878
01:02:37,934 --> 01:02:40,367
I just got in my car and left. 

879
01:02:40,367 --> 01:02:42,734
Okay, and where did you go
when you left?

880
01:02:42,734 --> 01:02:45,667
- I went straight home. 
- Okay.

881
01:02:45,667 --> 01:02:48,033
And I spoke to your dad
the night that we talked,

882
01:02:48,033 --> 01:02:52,601
and he said you came home
about the same time
that you're saying.

883
01:02:52,601 --> 01:02:54,167
Um...

884
01:02:54,167 --> 01:02:58,000
Is there anything else
that you can tell me
at this point?

885
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:01,267
Well, the thing that,
you know, really bothers me

886
01:03:01,267 --> 01:03:05,434
is that he was waiting outside
on her to get home.

887
01:03:05,434 --> 01:03:06,868
Uh-huh.

888
01:03:06,868 --> 01:03:09,434
So what if he was still there
after I left?

889
01:03:09,434 --> 01:03:13,367
Okay. Do you remember
when we talked at your house

890
01:03:13,367 --> 01:03:18,000
and you indicated to me that
you'd do anything you could to
help with this investigation?

891
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:19,868
Yes, I did. 

892
01:03:19,868 --> 01:03:23,734
Well, what you need to do is
start telling me the truth
about what happened.

893
01:03:23,734 --> 01:03:25,067
So I am. 

894
01:03:25,067 --> 01:03:29,167
We have got the physical
evidence back from the lab,

895
01:03:29,167 --> 01:03:33,100
and it implicates you in
the death of Rose Hilliard. 

896
01:03:33,100 --> 01:03:35,968
I don't see how. How?

897
01:03:35,968 --> 01:03:41,234
Your fingerprints were
lifted off the bruises
around her neck.

898
01:03:41,234 --> 01:03:44,300
I don't understand it. 

899
01:03:44,300 --> 01:03:48,567
Now, Martha, this is
the opportunity for you
to help yourself here.

900
01:03:48,567 --> 01:03:51,167
Now, either you are
a cold-blooded killer,

901
01:03:51,167 --> 01:03:54,000
- which I don't think
  is the case...
- No.

902
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:58,634
or something happened
in that apartment that
caused you to do this.

903
01:03:58,634 --> 01:04:03,200
There is no doubt
that you did this. None. 

904
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:05,501
But only you can
explain to me
what happened,

905
01:04:05,501 --> 01:04:07,868
and I want you
to do that.

906
01:04:12,801 --> 01:04:16,334
I can't. I just--
I don't know.

907
01:04:16,334 --> 01:04:21,767
Is there any way that you can
explain your fingerprints
around her neck?

908
01:04:21,767 --> 01:04:24,734
No, sir. No, sir. 

909
01:04:24,734 --> 01:04:26,868
And the neighbors saw you
leave the apartment.

910
01:04:26,868 --> 01:04:28,868
You were the last one
to leave the apartment.

911
01:04:28,868 --> 01:04:33,100
The evidence is there.
You will be convicted of this.

912
01:04:33,100 --> 01:04:36,200
You need to tell me the truth
about what happened.

913
01:04:41,234 --> 01:04:43,734
I don't know.
I-I don't know.

914
01:04:43,734 --> 01:04:46,267
Well, the jury's not
going to believe that. 

915
01:04:46,267 --> 01:04:48,300
I want you to look
at these photographs.

916
01:04:48,300 --> 01:04:53,167
That what she looks like.
That's what you did you her.

917
01:04:53,167 --> 01:04:57,834
A jury's not gonna have
sympathy for you if you don't
show some kind of remorse.

918
01:04:57,834 --> 01:05:00,834
Now, it can be explained
how this happened.

919
01:05:00,834 --> 01:05:03,601
Maybe you got into
an argument with her,
maybe things got out of hand.

920
01:05:03,601 --> 01:05:07,100
But only you know that.
She can't tell us.

921
01:05:07,100 --> 01:05:10,234
- I couldn't have done this.
- Well, you did.

922
01:05:10,234 --> 01:05:12,534
No, sir. No. No.

923
01:05:30,901 --> 01:05:35,100
Mr. Hightower, I wanted to
come over and talk to you and
let you know what's going on.

924
01:05:35,100 --> 01:05:37,767
Okay. I was
wondering about it.

925
01:05:37,767 --> 01:05:40,267
I just finished
talking with Martha,

926
01:05:40,267 --> 01:05:42,334
and based upon
my interview with her

927
01:05:42,334 --> 01:05:45,501
and evidence that we
recovered from the scene,

928
01:05:45,501 --> 01:05:48,734
she's been arrested for
the murder of Rose Hilliard. 

929
01:05:48,734 --> 01:05:51,701
Is that right?

930
01:05:51,701 --> 01:05:55,167
And I wanted to come over
and make you aware of
what's going on

931
01:05:55,167 --> 01:05:57,567
because you
are her family.

932
01:05:57,567 --> 01:05:59,167
Yes.

933
01:05:59,167 --> 01:06:01,701
She's currently
at the jail

934
01:06:01,701 --> 01:06:06,000
and that's where she'll be
until there's a hearing date. 

935
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,701
What the hell.
Sorry to hear it.

936
01:06:13,701 --> 01:06:15,701
Do you have
any questions for me?

937
01:06:15,701 --> 01:06:17,767
Do you know when
her hearing will be?

938
01:06:17,767 --> 01:06:21,334
It'll be fairly soon. 

939
01:06:21,334 --> 01:06:24,100
And they will give her
an attorney.

940
01:06:47,968 --> 01:06:49,701
Hey, Martha.

941
01:06:49,701 --> 01:06:53,033
Hi, Kyle.
I'm really glad you came.
It's horrible in here. 

942
01:06:53,033 --> 01:06:54,100
Yeah?

943
01:06:54,100 --> 01:06:56,067
So what's going on?

944
01:06:56,067 --> 01:06:58,200
I don't know.
I don't understand.

945
01:06:58,200 --> 01:07:00,334
I don't even know
why I'm here, really.

946
01:07:00,334 --> 01:07:03,133
And they think
I killed her.

947
01:07:03,133 --> 01:07:07,834
Kyle, you know me.
You know I could not
have done that.

948
01:07:07,834 --> 01:07:12,801
I think-- I really--
I think it's Jesse's dad.

949
01:07:12,801 --> 01:07:18,634
And I can't-- I don't know.
I don't know what happened.

950
01:07:18,634 --> 01:07:20,234
You got to help me, Kyle.

951
01:07:20,234 --> 01:07:24,334
You know that
I would never do
anything like this.

952
01:07:24,334 --> 01:07:25,467
Yeah.

953
01:07:25,467 --> 01:07:28,534
I-I don't understand.

954
01:07:28,534 --> 01:07:31,000
And it seemed like
the detective--

955
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:36,367
They think that I did this,
and I don't see how.

956
01:07:36,367 --> 01:07:39,067
I don't see how
that can be right.

957
01:07:39,067 --> 01:07:41,267
I don't know, Martha. 

958
01:07:41,267 --> 01:07:45,501
I don't understand it.
I don't know.

959
01:07:45,501 --> 01:07:48,534
I don't know what,
you know, what I did.

960
01:07:48,534 --> 01:07:52,634
I know that I had a really,
really, really bad headache,

961
01:07:52,634 --> 01:07:56,167
and when he started yelling,
I just wanted to go home.

962
01:07:56,167 --> 01:07:59,133
And I didn't know
who he was,

963
01:07:59,133 --> 01:08:02,601
and when I tried
to ask her who he was,

964
01:08:02,601 --> 01:08:06,367
she told me to
mind my own business.

965
01:08:06,367 --> 01:08:10,367
And that kind of
made me feel bad

966
01:08:10,367 --> 01:08:14,567
because, I thought, you know,
I thought I could talk to her
like a daughter.

967
01:08:14,567 --> 01:08:17,767
I mean, after all,
she left me with, you know,

968
01:08:17,767 --> 01:08:20,501
her most prized
possession: her baby.

969
01:08:20,501 --> 01:08:22,200
Yeah.

970
01:08:22,200 --> 01:08:24,133
And she's asked me for
all kinds of favors,

971
01:08:24,133 --> 01:08:28,601
and I just didn't think
it was too much to ask
who he was.

972
01:08:28,601 --> 01:08:32,601
And she was really mad
and didn't want
to talk about it.

973
01:08:34,968 --> 01:08:36,567
I don't know, Martha. 

974
01:08:37,868 --> 01:08:40,601
You got to help me, Kyle.
You got to.

975
01:08:40,601 --> 01:08:42,968
I mean, I don't
what I can do, but...

976
01:08:44,100 --> 01:08:46,801
I... I don't know
how this happened.

977
01:08:46,801 --> 01:08:50,234
We have to figure this out.
We have to. 

978
01:08:50,234 --> 01:08:54,901
I didn't do it, Kyle.
You know I wouldn't
do anything like that.

979
01:08:54,901 --> 01:08:56,634
Yeah.

980
01:08:56,634 --> 01:08:58,701
I don't know, Martha.

981
01:08:58,701 --> 01:09:02,801
- I just-- I don't understand.
- I don't either. 

982
01:09:07,467 --> 01:09:10,601
[TV playing]

983
01:09:20,334 --> 01:09:22,067
[Man]
Good morning, everyone.

984
01:09:22,067 --> 01:09:24,834
We've obviously gone through
a very tragic set of events.

985
01:09:24,834 --> 01:09:28,367
It is, um...

986
01:09:28,367 --> 01:09:32,167
But we need move on,
and because of that,

987
01:09:32,167 --> 01:09:35,901
we have gone out and we have
hired Kyle's mom, Helen, 

988
01:09:35,901 --> 01:09:37,501
with the idea that--

989
01:09:37,501 --> 01:09:43,434
She can't take
the two ladies' place
because they are, you know--

990
01:09:43,434 --> 01:09:45,234
We had a longtime employee 

991
01:09:45,234 --> 01:09:48,234
and we had a short-time employee
