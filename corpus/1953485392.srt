00:00:16,032 --> 00:00:19,490
[Shower]

2
00:00:26,918 --> 00:00:27,998
Can I join in?

3
00:00:29,087 --> 00:00:31,294
-What are you doing here?
-Tyler invited me.

4
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:36,458
-A heads up would have been nice Ty.
-Oh, please, like you never had a three way in this
shower before.

5
00:00:37,053 --> 00:00:37,963
Touché

6
00:00:38,388 --> 00:00:39,673
Hey.

7
00:00:43,852 --> 00:00:46,685
Wait, hold it. REALLY?!

8
00:00:47,021 --> 00:00:47,851
Tyler! Tyler!

9
00:00:48,189 --> 00:00:51,306
-Get up!
-You are such a buzz-kill.

10
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:52,853
How did you get in here?

11
00:00:53,319 --> 00:00:54,809
He snuck in behind me.

12
00:00:56,114 --> 00:01:01,529
Neanderthal! Hello, we have rehearsal in, oh, 20
minutes. Let's go.

13
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:05,240
Shit!

14
00:01:40,283 --> 00:01:45,152
You're not just grey, you're going bald!

15
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:46,990
Get him out of our house.

16
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:48,450
I will cut you!

17
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:03,590
Um, yeah hi that's mine.

18
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:05,926
Come on, Michael's going to kill us.

19
00:02:06,267 --> 00:02:06,722
Kill us?

20
00:02:10,104 --> 00:02:13,187
-Oh, hold! Mike!
-Hey Michael how are you?

21
00:02:13,816 --> 00:02:15,431
-Oh, I'm so glad I ran into you.
-Yeah, me too

22
00:02:15,777 --> 00:02:19,019
-Hey, did you get my email about the tickets?
-I did, in a couple of days we're going to send out an
email-

23
00:02:19,572 --> 00:02:21,779
The opening is a few weeks away and you are
definitely going to be there.

24
00:02:22,116 --> 00:02:23,026
-We're so grateful!
-Good for you!

25
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:25,116
-Thank you so much!
-It's going to be a thrilling night.

26
00:02:25,453 --> 00:02:26,112
I know.

27
00:02:27,121 --> 00:02:27,701
Hey Michael!

28
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:30,450
Oh, Mark Anthony!

29
00:02:30,917 --> 00:02:32,407
I'm good, Papa Bear. How are you?
-I could use 2 tickets.

30
00:02:32,835 --> 00:02:34,746
No question, it's going to happen. I'm not going to
leave you alone on this island!

31
00:02:35,088 --> 00:02:35,952
Oh, thank you!

32
00:03:03,616 --> 00:03:04,981
Does this look ok?

33
00:03:05,326 --> 00:03:06,065
You didn't even look!

34
00:03:06,369 --> 00:03:11,079
-What are you so worried about?
-Michael says that this guy could bankroll the entire
film without blinking an eye.

35
00:03:11,541 --> 00:03:12,701
And I need to impress him.

36
00:03:13,042 --> 00:03:15,909
Yeah, what the world needs is another bear
documentary.

37
00:03:17,005 --> 00:03:22,420
-Fuck it, I look terrible! I look awful.
-Babe, don't worry. Why are you getting all grizzly?

38
00:03:23,011 --> 00:03:25,627
I know you just woke up from a very big
hibernation.

39
00:03:26,055 --> 00:03:26,919
You're so cranky.

40
00:03:27,348 --> 00:03:28,383
You haven't had enough berries.

41
00:03:28,725 --> 00:03:29,589
Great, Great, are you done?

42
00:03:29,934 --> 00:03:31,094
You will look totally woofy for this investor, now I'm
done.

43
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:32,725
Stop. Stop.

44
00:03:33,146 --> 00:03:36,354
-I know you've never been into the whole bear
thing.
-It's not that I'm not into it, I love this t-shirt.

45
00:03:37,025 --> 00:03:39,687
I don't know what the word is, I guess it's just
over-produced?

46
00:03:40,111 --> 00:03:42,523
That's something we can explore in the
documentary.
-Is it?

47
00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:46,152
This is the first movie I've ever made and I would
really love your moral support

48
00:03:46,576 --> 00:03:47,486
You have my support.

49
00:03:47,952 --> 00:03:52,412
-You also have his support, because he's so cute.
-He is so cute.
-I support you. Orally. Morally.

50
00:03:53,041 --> 00:03:56,875
Thank you, great. That means so much to me but I
have one more thing I wanted to ask you.

51
00:03:57,337 --> 00:04:01,296
-What?
-Is there any chance you could ask your mother if
we could stay at her place...

52
00:04:02,216 --> 00:04:04,252
-You set me up.
-We would get amazing footage.

53
00:04:04,677 --> 00:04:05,837
You used that cute face and you set me up.

54
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:07,209
Um, maybe?

55
00:04:08,097 --> 00:04:11,089
Ok. I will ask her if she's full. Of herself. Ok, good
luck.

56
00:04:11,809 --> 00:04:13,845
-Now go and maul a hunter or whatever it is you do.
-I will do that.

57
00:04:14,812 --> 00:04:17,144
Um...you're so cute.

58
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:21,061
All we have to worry about is making the show
great. Don't even worry about all that

59
00:04:21,611 --> 00:04:23,476
-Michael!
-Oh! Oh my god!

60
00:04:24,197 --> 00:04:25,858
-How are you, sir?
-Fantastic.

61
00:04:26,532 --> 00:04:29,649
Let me ask you a question, whose dick do I have to
suck to get 2 opening night tickets? I've been
calling everybody.

62
00:04:30,453 --> 00:04:31,568
That dick would be mine.

63
00:04:32,121 --> 00:04:34,533
All right, I'll do it here. I will if I got to but..

64
00:04:34,999 --> 00:04:37,991
-Please just send them to me, me and Jen.
-No question, absolutely.

65
00:04:38,795 --> 00:04:40,535
Ok, whatever you want, and then I want to talk to
you about Dogma the Musical.

66
00:04:42,131 --> 00:04:43,996
-You and Ben Affleck. Get in line.
-All right.

67
00:04:45,134 --> 00:04:46,169
Good seeing you.

68
00:04:46,677 --> 00:04:49,510
Yeah beginning of September's great but I need to
set this by labor day.

69
00:04:49,806 --> 00:04:50,215
It's very important.

70
00:04:51,224 --> 00:04:52,088
It's crucial

71
00:04:54,644 --> 00:04:57,977
I am the one who makes the decisions artistically
and creatively, besides the director.

72
00:05:00,983 --> 00:05:04,316
I paid a lot of money for this.

73
00:05:05,738 --> 00:05:09,071
I was thinking about this for the-

74
00:05:10,785 --> 00:05:16,496
Yeah looks great hold on, hold on, hold on..

75
00:05:18,709 --> 00:05:24,420
I'm so stressed about time-There's a deadline

76
00:05:26,592 --> 00:05:32,303
-Take a look
-Ho..hold on.

77
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:39,978
You're not even paying attention.

78
00:05:42,442 --> 00:05:48,153
Oh.Yeah. I'm sorry....What?
-Can I just get a second with you, please?
-Oh yeah!

79
00:05:51,117 --> 00:05:52,527
Michael!

80
00:05:54,078 --> 00:05:56,410
-It's so good to see you.
-Fantastic to see you!

81
00:05:57,290 --> 00:06:00,953
I am hearing such amazing things about your show.
-It's going to be a great show and you have two
tickets to opening night.

82
00:06:01,586 --> 00:06:06,956
-I am so there. And I don't have to pay for it?
-You don't have to pay.
-Good because I don't like to pay for
anything....well. sex...but nothing else.

83
00:06:07,925 --> 00:06:11,793
All right you call me. You call me now. Make sure
Frank DeCaro has two tickets for opening night.

84
00:06:12,305 --> 00:06:14,170
We're not going to dis Mr. Satellite Radio.

85
00:06:14,682 --> 00:06:15,341
Yeah, absolutely.

86
00:06:16,767 --> 00:06:17,256
Hey listen I have to go.

87
00:06:17,727 --> 00:06:18,591
Inside the bar, baby.

88
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:21,720
-Osito I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
-Go inside.

89
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:23,896
Oh baby, I got to take this one call.

90
00:06:24,233 --> 00:06:26,770
This is really, really important. Just one little phone
call.

91
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:32,155
No, I knew it was coming in. I'm sorry. Yeah, Michael
how are you?

92
00:06:43,211 --> 00:06:43,825
You're home.

93
00:06:45,213 --> 00:06:46,077
I'm home.

94
00:06:47,632 --> 00:06:50,419
Hey. No hello?

95
00:06:51,427 --> 00:06:52,712
Sorry.

96
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:54,510
Gin.

97
00:06:55,306 --> 00:06:56,136
Don't start.

98
00:06:57,725 --> 00:06:59,135
You're making lobster?

99
00:07:00,603 --> 00:07:01,308
Trying.

100
00:07:05,316 --> 00:07:06,852
Rehearsal not going well.

101
00:07:07,193 --> 00:07:09,229
Yeah, rehearsal, the job.

102
00:07:09,695 --> 00:07:14,064
Quit the job I'm sure Brett can find another bear cub
to make lattes.
-I can't do that and you know it.

103
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,281
Ty,just focus on your craft, the money will come

104
00:07:16,869 --> 00:07:17,574
Where from, Roger?

105
00:07:18,329 --> 00:07:21,571
As much as I love doing this pet project for
Michael...

106
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:23,239
No one's going to come to this show.

107
00:07:23,793 --> 00:07:27,627
Um, I believe Michael got a Tony nomination for
one his pet projects not too long ago.

108
00:07:30,007 --> 00:07:31,338
Hey.

109
00:07:32,927 --> 00:07:34,542
What is going on with you?

110
00:07:35,638 --> 00:07:36,718
Nothing.

111
00:07:38,724 --> 00:07:39,884
Ty?

112
00:07:40,935 --> 00:07:43,051
Roger what do you want me to say?

113
00:07:44,605 --> 00:07:46,846
I feel like I'm not contributing anything around here

114
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:51,268
and what I do make of the little money I have goes
right to my damn student loans

115
00:07:51,946 --> 00:07:53,527
I told you I would pay those off.

116
00:07:54,323 --> 00:07:56,063
And that's what I'm talking about.

117
00:07:57,243 --> 00:07:58,278
Ty. Come here.

118
00:07:59,287 --> 00:08:00,242
Please.

119
00:08:07,753 --> 00:08:11,291
So I put the lobster in and I just checked and it's not
dead.

120
00:08:11,966 --> 00:08:13,422
Is the water boiling?

121
00:08:14,051 --> 00:08:16,884
-Was it supposed to be boiling?
-Roger the flame's not on your torturing the poor
thing!

122
00:08:21,517 --> 00:08:22,506
What's this?

123
00:08:23,436 --> 00:08:24,767
I told you it wasn't dead.

124
00:08:25,938 --> 00:08:27,269
Open it.

125
00:08:39,994 --> 00:08:43,407
I, uh, don't know what to say.

126
00:08:46,042 --> 00:08:49,125
You say yes.

127
00:08:50,129 --> 00:08:52,085
I'm not ready to get married.

128
00:08:59,305 --> 00:09:00,920
I'm sorry. I...

129
00:09:01,432 --> 00:09:06,643
I get it, I get it. We haven't even been together as
long as our friends.

130
00:09:07,438 --> 00:09:08,302
The age difference.

131
00:09:09,815 --> 00:09:12,648
This is what I get for listening to my feelings.

132
00:09:14,028 --> 00:09:15,143
Rog...

133
00:09:40,221 --> 00:09:41,176
You ok?

134
00:09:43,766 --> 00:09:47,054
See all those people walking The Highline?

135
00:09:49,271 --> 00:09:52,889
To them their worlds are so big.

136
00:09:54,527 --> 00:09:56,188
Their dreams. Their fears.

137
00:09:58,698 --> 00:10:01,440
But from here they're just specks.

138
00:10:06,372 --> 00:10:09,409
I like us being part of the same speck.

139
00:10:17,007 --> 00:10:19,214
I just need more time.

140
00:10:34,984 --> 00:10:36,895
Take all the time you need.

141
00:10:38,446 --> 00:10:39,401
Rog...

142
00:10:43,117 --> 00:10:44,357
I love you.

143
00:10:47,288 --> 00:10:48,528
I know.

144
00:11:20,654 --> 00:11:25,899
[on screen] Wisely and slow. They stumble that run
fast -Romeo and Juliet

145
00:11:34,627 --> 00:11:37,039
[on screen] Shakespeare, Really theatre boy?

146
00:11:44,512 --> 00:11:47,504
[on screen] What are you trying to slow down,
Juliet?

147
00:11:52,686 --> 00:11:54,517
[on screen] Roger Proposed.

148
00:11:55,231 --> 00:11:58,439
Oh my god, Roger proposed?! That's fantastic.

149
00:11:58,859 --> 00:12:01,225
-You just scared the shit out me.
-Oh my god, I can't believe you're getting married.

150
00:12:01,695 --> 00:12:02,525
Marriage is like the new black.

151
00:12:02,947 --> 00:12:05,689
Wait. You're going to make me your bridesmaid or
whatever?

152
00:12:06,367 --> 00:12:08,483
We need to celebrate. Roger's got some
champagne around here somewhere?

153
00:12:09,078 --> 00:12:09,817
I said no.

154
00:12:10,621 --> 00:12:11,451
You what?

155
00:12:12,039 --> 00:12:13,449
Simon, I can't get married.

156
00:12:13,958 --> 00:12:18,452
Why not? He's like cute. Or, you know, your kind
cute anyway...

157
00:12:19,255 --> 00:12:20,290
Roger? Really?

158
00:12:20,756 --> 00:12:22,997
You know there's a sex act named after Roger!

159
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:25,170
-I got to go!
-If that's the marrying kind...

160
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:30,009
Wait. Who is that, and why are you telling him when
you should be telling me?

161
00:12:31,308 --> 00:12:32,093
Are you having an affair?

162
00:12:32,476 --> 00:12:33,056
Simon!

163
00:12:33,561 --> 00:12:39,648
-What? I thought you loved him.
-I do, I do but I don't know what to think.

164
00:12:40,317 --> 00:12:42,182
What is the problem?

165
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:47,189
I love him, ok? But marriage is a huge step, I'm 23
years old.

166
00:12:48,075 --> 00:12:49,531
Yeah, where is he anyway?

167
00:12:50,035 --> 00:12:52,242
I don't know. He's downtown doing some business
thing--

168
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:57,870
See! There is the problem! I could care less or show
any interest in what he's doing and he is so good to
me

169
00:12:58,586 --> 00:12:59,871
What did he do when you said no?

170
00:13:00,379 --> 00:13:00,868
He boiled a lobster alive.

171
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:03,295
Like a sacrifice?

172
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:06,624
He cooked me a lobster dinner, Simon.

173
00:13:07,595 --> 00:13:09,836
That is so romantic.

174
00:13:10,681 --> 00:13:11,841
I mean it's OK, Ty.

175
00:13:12,224 --> 00:13:13,430
If you're not ready, you're not ready.

176
00:13:13,767 --> 00:13:14,552
I'm not.

177
00:13:14,935 --> 00:13:16,971
And I can't stand that gay marriage is all of a
sudden legal in New York

178
00:13:17,438 --> 00:13:19,303
and everybody wants to do it.
-Preach it, girl.

179
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:23,433
Now when I go sleep with somebody's husband,
they get all diva in a brides' dress on me.

180
00:13:27,156 --> 00:13:29,613
So what did the rings look like? Not that it matters, I
know you're not ready.

181
00:13:29,992 --> 00:13:31,778
They were beautiful, Simon. They were perfect.

182
00:13:32,369 --> 00:13:33,233
Well did you tell him that?

183
00:13:33,621 --> 00:13:34,781
-No.
-Good move.

184
00:13:35,122 --> 00:13:36,157
So. Here's an idea.

185
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:37,950
Why don't you just get married at the court.

186
00:13:38,459 --> 00:13:41,747
And if you don't chicken out we can have a
fabulous wedding on the highline.

187
00:13:42,212 --> 00:13:44,578
I wish. Apparently he wanted to get married in
P-town.

188
00:13:44,924 --> 00:13:46,755
It's where he spent his summers during his
childhood.

189
00:13:47,176 --> 00:13:48,666
and it was his fantasy to get married there for years.

190
00:13:49,428 --> 00:13:51,339
Now it's a fantasy that I've shattered into a million
pieces.

191
00:13:51,764 --> 00:13:55,302
Shut up! P-town would have been so awesome!

192
00:13:55,684 --> 00:13:57,549
I heard the dick dock's amaze-balls.

193
00:13:58,979 --> 00:14:01,971
Oh, god, I don't know what to do, Simon.

194
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:03,935
Is he pressuring you?

195
00:14:04,234 --> 00:14:07,146
No, and that's what's killing me because he's being
so fucking understanding.

196
00:14:07,821 --> 00:14:09,152
Then don't worry about it!

197
00:14:09,698 --> 00:14:12,360
Just go buy him another sex toy or whatever
couples do.

198
00:14:12,868 --> 00:14:15,985
Oh...sex toy. That reminds me of the day we met.
Remember?

199
00:14:16,538 --> 00:14:18,119
That story is as tired as that shirt.

200
00:14:18,832 --> 00:14:19,070
Thank you.

201
00:14:19,917 --> 00:14:23,080
You could always get divorced. That's what straight
people do. It's good for the economy.

202
00:14:23,712 --> 00:14:24,497
Go away.

203
00:14:26,715 --> 00:14:29,832
Wait. Wasn't there supposed to be a party here
tonight?

204
00:14:30,636 --> 00:14:31,125
What?

205
00:14:31,512 --> 00:14:33,252
Yeah, Roger sent me an email yesterday and...

206
00:14:34,974 --> 00:14:38,887
Oh my god. That was supposed to be a surprise
engagement party thing

207
00:14:40,479 --> 00:14:42,310
Simon, who else got this email?

208
00:14:43,232 --> 00:14:47,316
-Like Fred, and Brent, and everybody.
-I got to get out of here.
-What?

209
00:14:47,861 --> 00:14:48,520
I got to get air.

210
00:14:48,946 --> 00:14:49,856
Wait, where are you going?

211
00:14:51,323 --> 00:14:54,406
And then we opened the door, it was Chita Rivera.

212
00:14:55,703 --> 00:15:02,120
Really, it happened today. [Phone Vibrates] Oh,
baby don't get that.

213
00:15:03,252 --> 00:15:04,241
Nobody's here yet.

214
00:15:06,338 --> 00:15:07,202
Fine. I said it's fine.

215
00:15:09,717 --> 00:15:11,253
No, George, don't even...

216
00:15:11,719 --> 00:15:12,174
What up, C?

217
00:15:13,303 --> 00:15:13,667
Hey Rog.

218
00:15:14,763 --> 00:15:15,627
She still on the phone?

219
00:15:16,056 --> 00:15:16,670
Always.

220
00:15:17,057 --> 00:15:17,762
It's going to be huge.

221
00:15:18,142 --> 00:15:19,723
Speaking of huge!

222
00:15:21,687 --> 00:15:23,302
Nobody wants me to work in this family.

223
00:15:23,772 --> 00:15:25,933
One little Tony nod and she's suddenly so important

224
00:15:26,358 --> 00:15:27,188
Yeah, try living with her.

225
00:15:27,526 --> 00:15:29,938
I heard that. Where Ty-Ty?

226
00:15:31,572 --> 00:15:32,231
He's not here.

227
00:15:33,657 --> 00:15:36,694
No, but according to Scruff, Brent and Fred are
twenty feet away.

228
00:15:37,536 --> 00:15:38,616
Yeah, because that thing is accurate.

229
00:15:39,163 --> 00:15:39,948
Who let you guys in?

230
00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:40,739
Little Bit.

231
00:15:41,206 --> 00:15:42,821
I did. Tyler will be right back.

232
00:15:43,625 --> 00:15:45,490
Hey you've reached Tyler. Leave a message.

233
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:49,791
Tyler, where the hell are you? Roger just got back
and he's asking

234
00:15:50,257 --> 00:15:53,920
where you are and get your ass back here. Or call
me.

235
00:16:00,851 --> 00:16:02,307
I didn't know you were on Scruff.

236
00:16:03,145 --> 00:16:05,227
What, I need to find a way to pass the time when
you're on the phone.

237
00:16:05,856 --> 00:16:07,096
Or someone.

238
00:16:08,525 --> 00:16:09,685
I never see you on Scruff, Rog.

239
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:13,778
Nah, my Scruffing days are over, C. I promised Tyler
I'd stop all that.

240
00:16:14,281 --> 00:16:14,815
Hey!

241
00:16:15,324 --> 00:16:16,109
Not accurate, huh?

242
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,024
Hey, honey buns.

243
00:16:20,245 --> 00:16:20,779
Hey sweetheart.

244
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:22,365
-Good to see you.
-What's going on?

245
00:16:22,998 --> 00:16:25,114
Hey, Simon. Where did Tyler go?

246
00:16:25,751 --> 00:16:27,036
He said he'd be right back.

247
00:16:29,046 --> 00:16:30,081
Is everything Ok, Rog?

248
00:16:31,632 --> 00:16:32,712
Yeah, everything's fine.

249
00:16:33,383 --> 00:16:36,841
Ok, while we're waiting for Princess, Fred has some
really big news.

250
00:16:37,179 --> 00:16:38,510
I do.

251
00:16:38,847 --> 00:16:43,637
So, I, uh. So you guys know I've been at the agency
for 47 million years.

252
00:16:44,853 --> 00:16:47,515
And I, uh, always wanted to have my own camera.

253
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:48,849
He bought the camera.

254
00:16:49,441 --> 00:16:54,310
Thank you. So I bought a camera and I am set to
make my own film.

255
00:16:55,572 --> 00:16:58,689
Michael, it turns out, has this friend who is
incredibly rich.

256
00:16:59,326 --> 00:17:00,782
So he got all the funding for the bear documentary!

257
00:17:01,203 --> 00:17:03,285
What? Oh!

258
00:17:03,747 --> 00:17:04,327
That's awesome.

259
00:17:04,706 --> 00:17:05,320
I did, thank you guys.

260
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:06,743
-I'm really excited about it.
-Ty-Ty!

261
00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:09,199
All my favorite people, except you.

262
00:17:09,795 --> 00:17:11,456
-Hi how are you? Good to see you.
-Hi, sweetheart.

263
00:17:11,797 --> 00:17:12,377
What's in the bag, baby?

264
00:17:12,756 --> 00:17:14,917
Something for my man... from the Leather Man.

265
00:17:15,467 --> 00:17:16,502
Oh lord.

266
00:17:21,265 --> 00:17:23,927
Oh! What?

267
00:17:24,852 --> 00:17:26,888
Shut up! They have a bear version of the Fleshlight?

268
00:17:27,604 --> 00:17:29,811
-What is it?
-You know what that is.
-Is that real hair?

269
00:17:30,357 --> 00:17:30,846
Let me see that.

270
00:17:31,775 --> 00:17:32,434
What is that Ty?

271
00:17:32,985 --> 00:17:33,599
Gross.

272
00:17:37,489 --> 00:17:38,899
You're right, Ty. They're beautiful!

273
00:17:39,575 --> 00:17:40,360
Did Roger know about this?

274
00:17:40,826 --> 00:17:42,362
Yes

275
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:44,864
Yes.

276
00:17:45,873 --> 00:17:46,828
What does that mean?

277
00:17:47,374 --> 00:17:48,409
It means they're getting married

278
00:17:49,293 --> 00:17:51,875
They're getting married!

279
00:17:52,379 --> 00:17:54,961
We're going to P-Town, bitches!

280
00:18:50,395 --> 00:18:52,431
Look who's pretending to do yard work!

281
00:18:52,981 --> 00:18:54,096
Hello gorgeous!

282
00:18:54,524 --> 00:18:57,106
My darling boy, hi baby!

283
00:18:57,945 --> 00:18:59,230
And you brought your gorgeous gaggle of gays.

284
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:01,816
-Ta-Dah!
-What are you waiting for, come on in.

285
00:19:04,701 --> 00:19:07,909
Darling, welcome, my beautiful handsome boy.

286
00:19:08,664 --> 00:19:09,779
You're laying it on a bit thick, don't you think.

287
00:19:10,165 --> 00:19:10,824
-Oh shush, you.
-Mama.

288
00:19:11,792 --> 00:19:13,748
Frederick, you're looking dapper.

289
00:19:14,044 --> 00:19:14,908
Thank you. How are you my Frederick?

290
00:19:15,295 --> 00:19:16,660
Lady Rose.

291
00:19:17,839 --> 00:19:18,999
You're my favorite, don't tell the rest.

292
00:19:20,259 --> 00:19:21,339
And here's who you really want to see.

293
00:19:22,094 --> 00:19:22,753
My other wife, how are you?

294
00:19:23,136 --> 00:19:25,297
My little hot spicy chili pepper.

295
00:19:26,223 --> 00:19:27,554
You look stunning as always, baby.

296
00:19:28,684 --> 00:19:29,298
Hi. Tyler.

297
00:19:29,726 --> 00:19:31,466
Tyler, oh, the blushing bride.

298
00:19:31,979 --> 00:19:33,640
Oh and how sweet. You brought your father.

299
00:19:37,067 --> 00:19:37,897
Congratulations.

300
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:41,192
Thank you. Welcome to Rose's Place, boys!

301
00:19:41,738 --> 00:19:42,602
Ok, dial it down a bit.

302
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:44,321
Guess what? Shut up or I'll shove you back in.

303
00:19:46,368 --> 00:19:47,323
All right, Michael, where's my Michael?

304
00:19:47,744 --> 00:19:48,199
Yes Dove?

305
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:50,076
Honey you are all the way in the back, ok?

306
00:19:50,455 --> 00:19:52,195
The room is beautiful but the electric is for shit, so
be careful.

307
00:19:52,666 --> 00:19:54,406
You always take such good care of us.

308
00:19:54,793 --> 00:19:56,533
That's because you have a bow-tie and your
boyfriend is cute.

309
00:19:57,421 --> 00:19:57,876
And where would you like us, mom?

310
00:19:58,255 --> 00:20:01,247
You...oh you know what? Your room currently has
three bears from Chicago

311
00:20:01,591 --> 00:20:03,957
No shit. The Chicago bears. I cannot make this up.

312
00:20:04,303 --> 00:20:05,418
So you're in the Castro Room, is that ok?

313
00:20:05,762 --> 00:20:06,421
Yes. That's fine.

314
00:20:06,847 --> 00:20:07,381
Oh that's great.

315
00:20:07,848 --> 00:20:12,012
-Thank you so much for accommodating us on such
short notice.
-No, sure that's fine.

316
00:20:12,436 --> 00:20:15,678
-Well, you trained him well.
-Learned from the best.
-That's right, you did.

317
00:20:16,857 --> 00:20:18,893
So are you guys excited? I'm excited for you.

318
00:20:19,443 --> 00:20:22,025
The big wedding...I mean finally New York did the
fucking right thing, right?

319
00:20:24,823 --> 00:20:25,482
Well it took some time... uh... err

320
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:29,946
Well put. Use your words.

321
00:20:31,204 --> 00:20:32,535
I think we're going to need a sign language
interpreter.

322
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:33,620
-I do sign language!
-You do?

323
00:20:33,999 --> 00:20:34,738
No. I do!

324
00:20:35,125 --> 00:20:36,331
I love gays.

325
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:37,619
Is that gay?

326
00:20:37,961 --> 00:20:38,165
That's gay.

327
00:20:38,503 --> 00:20:38,992
That's lesbian.

328
00:20:39,379 --> 00:20:40,960
That's a good night at the Dick-Dock.

329
00:20:41,381 --> 00:20:41,915
Stupid!

330
00:20:42,257 --> 00:20:44,043
-See, this is where he gets it.
-I love her.

331
00:20:44,551 --> 00:20:45,882
-I love you.
-I love you.

332
00:20:46,219 --> 00:20:48,426
-I'm familiar with you.
-I like you very much.
-I'm adopted.

333
00:20:49,639 --> 00:20:52,301
So you guys ready to go? Your room is upstairs.

334
00:20:52,934 --> 00:20:55,175
And I installed some dual head showers.

335
00:20:56,146 --> 00:20:56,555
No you didn't?

336
00:20:57,064 --> 00:20:57,644
Yes I did.

337
00:20:58,148 --> 00:20:58,762
Just like home!

338
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:01,644
So when are your parents coming, honey?

339
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:02,439
They'll be here soon

340
00:21:03,028 --> 00:21:05,235
Oh good. And isn't there another. A ninth?
One..two...three.

341
00:21:05,947 --> 00:21:08,609
Ah, he's...on his way. He missed the ferry and took a
submarine instead.

342
00:21:09,117 --> 00:21:09,606
Oh he did?

343
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:11,149
He said fairy?

344
00:21:14,373 --> 00:21:15,704
Wardrobe change! Quick!

345
00:21:16,124 --> 00:21:16,738
We're missing tea!

346
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:18,786
Wardrobe change? Does he know it's BearWeek?

347
00:21:19,252 --> 00:21:19,991
Yeah, it's like brown or beige!

348
00:21:32,891 --> 00:21:34,722
Holy shit! This is amazing!

349
00:21:35,227 --> 00:21:38,014
Twinkerbell says there's only, like, 3 twinks on this
whole...

350
00:21:38,814 --> 00:21:42,227
Slimed already. I need a cocktail.

351
00:21:43,026 --> 00:21:44,186
And there she goes.

352
00:21:44,528 --> 00:21:45,893
Hey, there's Randy.

353
00:21:46,613 --> 00:21:48,899
Of course. We travel eight hours to hang out with
the same idiots.

354
00:21:49,324 --> 00:21:50,029
Oh stop.

355
00:21:50,951 --> 00:21:51,315
Hey man.

356
00:21:51,785 --> 00:21:53,116
I think I had a dream like this once.

357
00:21:54,496 --> 00:21:55,360
Sorry. I've been robbed.

358
00:21:58,750 --> 00:21:59,830
Definitely seeing you later.

359
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:01,074
Yes you will.

360
00:22:02,712 --> 00:22:05,169
Randy! You crazy bastard!

361
00:22:07,801 --> 00:22:09,257
Is this place fucking nuts or what?

362
00:22:09,719 --> 00:22:10,333
What are you doing?

363
00:22:10,762 --> 00:22:12,127
I'm making a bear documentary.

364
00:22:12,597 --> 00:22:16,431
Oh good. Because that's just what the world needs,
another bear documentary.

365
00:22:17,018 --> 00:22:17,507
Did you?

366
00:22:17,894 --> 00:22:18,599
I just got here.

367
00:22:19,771 --> 00:22:20,601
Who you here with Randy?

368
00:22:21,148 --> 00:22:23,309
I'm staying with my friend Nate. He's the guy that
runs the dune tours.

369
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:24,605
Oh, dune tours?

370
00:22:24,985 --> 00:22:27,442
That sounds awesome. Can we go on a dune tour?
-Yeah, sure.

371
00:22:28,196 --> 00:22:30,562
Nate? As in Nathaniel Reed, Nate?

372
00:22:31,158 --> 00:22:33,194
Yeah, he's around here somewhere. I think he's
getting me a drink.

373
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:34,490
Who's Nathaniel Reed?

374
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:37,360
That is Nathaniel Reed.

375
00:23:04,691 --> 00:23:05,350
Hey Roger.

376
00:23:06,067 --> 00:23:06,931
Hey how you been.

377
00:23:07,986 --> 00:23:09,271
Good. You?

378
00:23:09,988 --> 00:23:10,397
Good

379
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:13,571
Hey Michael.

380
00:23:15,869 --> 00:23:17,234
-Still hanging around with this one?

381
00:23:17,829 --> 00:23:18,818
He won't let me go.

382
00:23:19,122 --> 00:23:21,488
This is who I spend most of my time with. Carlos,
Nate.

383
00:23:22,042 --> 00:23:22,747
How are you.

384
00:23:23,335 --> 00:23:24,916
Good. Nice handshake.

385
00:23:25,378 --> 00:23:26,868
And these are the boys from Brooklyn

386
00:23:27,297 --> 00:23:27,752
Bert and Ernie.

387
00:23:28,131 --> 00:23:28,916
Hi. Brent.

388
00:23:29,758 --> 00:23:30,964
Hey. Fred.

389
00:23:31,343 --> 00:23:32,458
Nice to meet you.

390
00:23:32,844 --> 00:23:34,709
Hey, would you mind if I shot you for my
documentary?

391
00:23:35,347 --> 00:23:37,338
Here. Just stand over here with the guys.

392
00:23:37,807 --> 00:23:38,045
Here?

393
00:23:38,391 --> 00:23:40,222
-That's good.
-I have a room upstairs.

394
00:23:40,810 --> 00:23:42,266
oh, it's uh not a porno.

395
00:23:42,938 --> 00:23:43,597
Too bad.

396
00:23:44,064 --> 00:23:45,179
Yeah. It is too bad.

397
00:23:45,732 --> 00:23:48,018
Hey Nate, I want you to meet Tyler.

398
00:23:48,652 --> 00:23:49,391
His fiancé.

399
00:23:49,778 --> 00:23:51,939
-They're betrothed.
-Really.

400
00:23:52,364 --> 00:23:54,025
Nice to meet you, Tyler. Congratulations.

401
00:23:54,741 --> 00:23:55,856
Hey thanks, nice to meet you too.

402
00:24:02,832 --> 00:24:05,448
Hey! Who's buying?

403
00:24:06,545 --> 00:24:08,911
Well...can somebody loan me a twenty?

404
00:24:09,339 --> 00:24:10,670
Shit, Brent. There's Varla Jean Merman.

405
00:24:11,091 --> 00:24:12,126
I want to get her for the documentary.

406
00:24:12,467 --> 00:24:13,456
I need you to do the talking.

407
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,751
I'm getting roped into everything. What about that
host?

408
00:24:16,096 --> 00:24:17,677
You got a host now? What happened with a host?

409
00:24:18,181 --> 00:24:21,264
Your friend is making us use his husband as the
host of the documentary.

410
00:24:21,601 --> 00:24:22,886
You're kidding? I don't even know him.

411
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:26,603
I don't know him either, but he's on the late ferry
and I don't really want to miss this, Brent.

412
00:24:27,065 --> 00:24:27,554
Come on.

413
00:24:27,941 --> 00:24:29,021
No fun for us. Bye!

414
00:24:29,401 --> 00:24:32,484
-Bye!
-Work, work, work.
-I don't know about you guys but I need a drink.

415
00:24:32,862 --> 00:24:35,353
-You want anything, babe?
-Same, Harrison on the rocks.

416
00:24:35,865 --> 00:24:37,150
I'm going to say no.

417
00:24:37,576 --> 00:24:38,861
You get off that thing. Do you want a drink?

418
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:41,367
No, I'm cool baby. You go ahead. I don't want a
drink.

419
00:24:43,290 --> 00:24:44,029
Randy, shut up.

420
00:24:44,332 --> 00:24:44,787
Nice to meet you.

421
00:24:45,208 --> 00:24:45,867
Nice to meet you too.

422
00:24:48,211 --> 00:24:49,166
Married, huh?

423
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:52,371
People change, Nate.

424
00:24:53,216 --> 00:24:54,080
Ok.

425
00:24:55,468 --> 00:24:56,833
So you're running the dune tours.

426
00:24:57,262 --> 00:25:00,675
Yeah. You should come on one. I'll give you a tour
personally.

427
00:25:01,182 --> 00:25:04,219
Oh! We would love that, wouldn't we? That'd be
great.

428
00:25:05,312 --> 00:25:06,597
Shoot, Randy. Is that you?

429
00:25:07,314 --> 00:25:08,724
Red. E. Randy?

430
00:25:10,275 --> 00:25:10,855
Really?

431
00:25:11,735 --> 00:25:13,020
Pays to advertise.

432
00:25:13,528 --> 00:25:18,147
Because Randy's ready. Cuz Randy's ready. Randy's
ready!

433
00:25:25,999 --> 00:25:27,409
Can I have a Harrison and ice, please?

434
00:25:27,834 --> 00:25:29,995
How you doing?....make it two.

435
00:25:57,447 --> 00:26:02,032
Really? It's a kilt.

436
00:26:05,413 --> 00:26:11,750
-Oh. Sorry.
-Don't be. I'm not exactly nimble myself.
-Here or in the bedroom?

437
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:13,409
Oh, just here.

438
00:26:14,589 --> 00:26:17,331
Sorry. I don't know why I just said that. I'm just
looking for someone.

439
00:26:18,093 --> 00:26:18,832
Aren't we all?

440
00:26:19,552 --> 00:26:21,167
No. Seriously. Just looking for a friend.

441
00:26:21,596 --> 00:26:24,338
Oh well, then don't let me stand in your way.

442
00:26:25,016 --> 00:26:27,723
No! You're not in my way. Just...heading to the bar.

443
00:26:28,395 --> 00:26:30,807
Yeah? I thought you said you were looking for a
friend.

444
00:26:31,398 --> 00:26:33,514
If you knew my friend you'd know he'd be at the
bar.

445
00:26:34,901 --> 00:26:36,516
Well in that case it was great to meet you...uh...?

446
00:26:37,028 --> 00:26:41,021
-Tyler. Tyler Hall, nice to meet you.
-Big Dan
-Yeah, I'll say.

447
00:26:41,574 --> 00:26:43,940
Pleasure to meet you, Tyler. How's your bear hunt
going?

448
00:26:44,411 --> 00:26:47,995
No bear hunting for me this time, actually. I'm
getting married.

449
00:26:48,456 --> 00:26:51,619
Really? How old are you?

450
00:26:52,043 --> 00:26:55,331
-Yeah, I know. I'm young.
-No, no judgments. Just a question.

451
00:26:56,047 --> 00:26:58,038
23, but we've been together a long time.

452
00:26:58,633 --> 00:27:00,498
Your fiancée is a lucky man, Tyler.

453
00:27:05,432 --> 00:27:09,266
-Shit. My parents are here already.
-You brought your parents to bear week?

454
00:27:09,811 --> 00:27:10,800
To the wedding.

455
00:27:11,187 --> 00:27:14,224
Right! Right, well I hope your dad isn't the hirsute
type.

456
00:27:14,691 --> 00:27:16,932
You know how ruthless these guys can be.

457
00:27:18,069 --> 00:27:19,479
I got to go!

458
00:27:20,447 --> 00:27:22,438
Yeah, so this is the historic West End.

459
00:27:23,032 --> 00:27:26,490
Yeah, each house has a marker and they've been
floated here.

460
00:27:26,870 --> 00:27:27,359
Oh. No.

461
00:27:27,746 --> 00:27:32,536
-It's bright out here, though, isn't it?
-It's really...Floated? Impressive.

462
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:35,075
Yeah. In the 1 850s.

463
00:27:35,545 --> 00:27:37,035
-Wow, that's something.
-Here we are.

464
00:27:37,547 --> 00:27:39,833
Oh. Thank you.
-Cute. All right.

465
00:27:44,554 --> 00:27:45,259
-Keep the change
-Thanks, Daddy.

466
00:27:45,555 --> 00:27:47,011
-You're a strapping young man.

467
00:27:47,307 --> 00:27:49,093
-Oh no boys, you don't have to do that.
-Oh we got it, daddy.

468
00:27:50,477 --> 00:27:52,058
Gabe, I'm going to check out the kitchen.

469
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:55,478
I thought the point of a vacation was to have
someone else cook for you.

470
00:27:56,149 --> 00:27:59,391
-Hey Daddy.
-Nice suspenders.

471
00:28:00,069 --> 00:28:00,774
Woof.

472
00:28:01,446 --> 00:28:02,811
Why is everyone calling me daddy?

473
00:28:03,823 --> 00:28:05,734
Hey Rhino can cook, can't you Rhi?

474
00:28:06,075 --> 00:28:06,860
Your name is Rhino?

475
00:28:07,285 --> 00:28:08,365
It's an old football name.

476
00:28:09,370 --> 00:28:12,658
You play football and you cook? I bet you made
your Daddy proud.

477
00:28:13,082 --> 00:28:14,538
See I can play the daddy game too.

478
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:18,748
Well, we don't really talk anymore... And this is my
husband Jimmy.

479
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:19,869
Hey Jimmy.

480
00:28:23,176 --> 00:28:24,416
That's my husband Rhino.

481
00:28:25,553 --> 00:28:26,212
Your....?

482
00:28:26,596 --> 00:28:27,631
Yeah, we're in a thruple.

483
00:28:28,264 --> 00:28:29,253
No..no I'll take it thank you.

484
00:28:29,599 --> 00:28:32,011
Well we'll be on the deck if you need any more help.

485
00:28:34,103 --> 00:28:34,808
Daddy.

486
00:28:35,271 --> 00:28:35,635
Ah!

487
00:28:36,064 --> 00:28:36,769
You made it.

488
00:28:37,106 --> 00:28:37,470
Yeah.

489
00:28:38,233 --> 00:28:40,064
What's the matter? Are you having a heart attack?

490
00:28:40,568 --> 00:28:42,183
They're all husbands.

491
00:28:42,654 --> 00:28:43,313
Yeah, I know dad.

492
00:28:43,655 --> 00:28:44,144
All three of them

493
00:28:44,447 --> 00:28:45,277
Yeah, I know

494
00:28:45,615 --> 00:28:47,230
Where do you even find a bed that big?

495
00:28:50,954 --> 00:28:52,865
You know your mother is going to have a stroke
when she sees that.

496
00:28:53,498 --> 00:28:54,157
Ok, so let's not tell her.

497
00:28:54,457 --> 00:28:54,786
Ok.

498
00:28:55,583 --> 00:28:58,450
Oooh. Hi daddy.

499
00:29:02,882 --> 00:29:06,545
I hate to get all Barbra Streisand on you but I think
I'd look even more attractive if we filmed over here.

500
00:29:07,387 --> 00:29:09,002
Do you mind? Thank you!

501
00:29:09,722 --> 00:29:11,462
Oh hey, how are you darling?

502
00:29:11,766 --> 00:29:12,630
This is the best BearWeek ever.

503
00:29:13,434 --> 00:29:15,140
You know you're actually clashing with me.

504
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,555
Would you mind standing over there?

505
00:29:16,855 --> 00:29:18,470
Maybe on the other side of the bar, that'd be great.

506
00:29:18,815 --> 00:29:19,930
Come back later, actually. How's this?

507
00:29:20,358 --> 00:29:21,188
Oh that looks beautiful.

508
00:29:21,693 --> 00:29:22,603
Do my teeth look yellow?

509
00:29:23,027 --> 00:29:23,391
No.

510
00:29:23,695 --> 00:29:24,434
Ok. Speed.

511
00:29:24,821 --> 00:29:25,276
Action!

512
00:29:26,197 --> 00:29:30,406
-Ok. So how has Bear Week been treating you?
-Oh my god it has been really amazing.

513
00:29:31,077 --> 00:29:35,662
Although there have been several widespread
brownouts in the evening hours because of all the
CPAP machines.

514
00:29:38,293 --> 00:29:39,658
Any other issues this week?

515
00:29:40,086 --> 00:29:42,873
Well you know there have been so many bears I
found the other

516
00:29:43,298 --> 00:29:46,131
day when I was walking down Commercial Street,
by the time I'd gotten to the East End,

517
00:29:46,426 --> 00:29:47,211
I'd coughed up a hairball.

518
00:29:48,303 --> 00:29:49,634
And I don't even own a cat.

519
00:29:50,346 --> 00:29:50,926
Brent, how's it going?

520
00:29:51,222 --> 00:29:51,631
Good.

521
00:29:52,098 --> 00:29:54,305
We're just interviewing this school bus.

522
00:29:54,893 --> 00:29:55,348
This is her lunch!

523
00:29:56,394 --> 00:29:57,474
Have you seen Ty?

524
00:29:58,062 --> 00:29:58,346
Who?

525
00:29:59,022 --> 00:29:59,727
Ty. The guy I'm...

526
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:01,350
The guy I'm marrying.

527
00:30:01,649 --> 00:30:03,605
Oh yeah, you are married. Thanks for that invite.

528
00:30:04,694 --> 00:30:05,183
No. I haven't seen him.

529
00:30:05,612 --> 00:30:06,226
Shit.

530
00:30:06,613 --> 00:30:08,695
But Michael Moore here has got about another 1 00
hours left

531
00:30:08,990 --> 00:30:10,480
of slanted, biased filming.

532
00:30:10,783 --> 00:30:12,899
Oh and PS, Carlos and Michael went back to the
house.

533
00:30:13,494 --> 00:30:14,574
Ok. I'll tell the Provincetown Gazette.

534
00:30:14,871 --> 00:30:16,532
Thanks, have fun.

535
00:30:18,791 --> 00:30:21,533
OK, move the camera back over to me here, he's
going to pull focus. I know who the audience is!

536
00:30:25,632 --> 00:30:27,623
Oh ok. Now this is a kitchen!

537
00:30:28,009 --> 00:30:30,421
This is a gorgeous kitchen.

538
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:33,302
-Mom, be careful, don't touch anything.
-Honey..it's granite. You can't hurt granite.

539
00:30:33,723 --> 00:30:35,759
This is a place where a lot of cooking goes on,
gentleman and I--

540
00:30:36,476 --> 00:30:38,717
IfYOU can get Mrs. Madrigal to lighten up on the
kitchen rules I can

541
00:30:39,062 --> 00:30:41,769
cook us up something delicious!

542
00:30:42,690 --> 00:30:45,898
Oh, it's such an honor I've been waiting to meet you
forever.

543
00:30:46,444 --> 00:30:48,685
This is my handsome husband, Carlos.

544
00:30:50,573 --> 00:30:51,232
Are you the producer?

545
00:30:51,616 --> 00:30:52,105
I am.

546
00:30:52,742 --> 00:30:55,074
I just want to thank you so much for putting my son
in your show.

547
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:56,951
Oh, he's fantastic.

548
00:30:57,288 --> 00:30:58,448
We couldn't' do it without him. He's wonderful.

549
00:30:58,790 --> 00:31:01,907
You know he played Patrick in Mame and he was
heartbreaking.

550
00:31:02,251 --> 00:31:02,660
Mom!

551
00:31:03,002 --> 00:31:06,620
I bet he was. I want details. I want every nuance.

552
00:31:07,632 --> 00:31:08,291
Have you heard him sing?

553
00:31:09,425 --> 00:31:10,335
We're going to talk later.

554
00:31:10,969 --> 00:31:11,799
She means well.

555
00:31:12,261 --> 00:31:13,546
She's fantastic.

556
00:31:16,891 --> 00:31:21,635
No, I said, No offense taken. If it weren't for
electrolysis I probably would be a bear.

557
00:31:22,146 --> 00:31:23,226
That's the truth.

558
00:31:25,441 --> 00:31:26,726
Be right back, we have new people.

559
00:31:27,068 --> 00:31:29,400
Hello! Welcome to my humble abode.

560
00:31:29,737 --> 00:31:30,476
These are my parents.

561
00:31:30,822 --> 00:31:31,652
I'm Rachel.

562
00:31:34,867 --> 00:31:36,403
Hello Mrs. Madrigal. I'm Gabe.

563
00:31:36,744 --> 00:31:38,325
Mrs. Madrigal? Michael. Really?

564
00:31:38,663 --> 00:31:40,199
Oh, why's it always got to be me?

565
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:45,580
It is you. Mrs. Madrigalis a character from a story
that he's obsessed with.

566
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:49,629
I am Rose. And PS, Ms. Madrigal, much older and a
tranny.

567
00:31:51,134 --> 00:31:53,045
So, will you be joining us for dinner this evening?

568
00:31:53,761 --> 00:31:54,295
We'd love too.

569
00:31:54,887 --> 00:31:55,171
Great.

570
00:31:55,763 --> 00:31:57,879
You know Gabe asked me to make a dish tonight!

571
00:31:58,224 --> 00:31:58,758
Well..yes.

572
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:03,264
No, no he did not. Michael -One. One dish, Miss
Paula Deen?

573
00:32:03,646 --> 00:32:06,103
Prepare to have your arteries clogged. And I hope
you like mayonnaise.

574
00:32:06,441 --> 00:32:07,681
But it's going to be delicious.

575
00:32:08,026 --> 00:32:09,766
It's gonna be delicious!

576
00:33:02,663 --> 00:33:03,072
Excuse me.

577
00:33:04,082 --> 00:33:08,451
Everybody. Can I have your attention please?

578
00:33:09,128 --> 00:33:12,211
So. I just want to say welcome

579
00:33:12,882 --> 00:33:17,672
Thank you for warming up my home and for
sharing this beautiful meal.

580
00:33:18,012 --> 00:33:20,128
You're welcome!

581
00:33:20,556 --> 00:33:24,515
And thank you to Michael for the heart attack on a
plate.

582
00:33:24,894 --> 00:33:26,555
Any time, Lady Rose.

583
00:33:27,939 --> 00:33:33,229
And I'd like to make a toast to the new friends and
old friends and family.

584
00:33:35,071 --> 00:33:39,861
And to Roger and Tyler. The gorgeous couple.

585
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:44,778
Any time two people fall in love it is a miracle.

586
00:33:45,373 --> 00:33:46,704
Love is love.

587
00:33:48,042 --> 00:33:54,789
We all wish you the best, congratulations gorgeous
gorgeous couple.

588
00:33:55,883 --> 00:33:58,841
I must say Brent. You are one lucky man,

589
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:01,131
To have a mother who's so supportive.

590
00:34:01,472 --> 00:34:02,302
And forward thinking.

591
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,254
I do?

592
00:34:03,599 --> 00:34:05,510
Why, Mikey, that wasn't your experience?

593
00:34:05,852 --> 00:34:07,012
When I told my mother I was gay,

594
00:34:07,353 --> 00:34:10,891
She said, You're not gay. You're fat. And fat stores
estrogen.

595
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:13,856
Whatever. I love my baby's estrogen.

596
00:34:14,652 --> 00:34:15,812
It is in your case.

597
00:34:16,696 --> 00:34:19,859
My teenage son decided to pull the wool over my
eyes.

598
00:34:20,199 --> 00:34:20,437
Mom.

599
00:34:20,783 --> 00:34:21,192
When he came out.

600
00:34:21,534 --> 00:34:22,899
Oh, I want to hear this.

601
00:34:23,536 --> 00:34:24,195
Ok.

602
00:34:24,871 --> 00:34:25,326
So.

603
00:34:25,872 --> 00:34:29,785
It's about 3:00 in the afternoon and I'd just done a
little yard work

604
00:34:30,126 --> 00:34:32,117
and I hear the phone ring, and I go in and get it.

605
00:34:32,545 --> 00:34:33,705
And it's the police.

606
00:34:34,046 --> 00:34:37,163
Telling me they have my son in custody.

607
00:34:37,967 --> 00:34:41,926
I should just say right here that Gabe was doing a
little bit of accounting work

608
00:34:42,263 --> 00:34:45,050
for the police department at the time. So I think you
would have called your

609
00:34:45,391 --> 00:34:46,551
Dad if it weren't for that.

610
00:34:47,018 --> 00:34:48,303
But he knew I would have killed him.

611
00:34:48,769 --> 00:34:49,679
What did you do?

612
00:34:50,521 --> 00:34:52,728
I stole a CD from a Sam Goody store.

613
00:34:54,650 --> 00:35:00,816
So. I am just furious. Crazy with anger, and I go
down to the police station.

614
00:35:01,157 --> 00:35:06,902
And there I am. I'm standing in this blue checkered
house coat, with these little

615
00:35:07,246 --> 00:35:11,410
scuffed up slippers and my hair is all crazy and I'm
just trying to make chit-chat

616
00:35:11,751 --> 00:35:14,868
with my friends at the police department, waiting
for my convict son!

617
00:35:15,254 --> 00:35:16,414
Mom.

618
00:35:17,673 --> 00:35:21,507
So anyway, so. I get him in the car and I take off like
a shot.

619
00:35:22,845 --> 00:35:24,085
and I can remember my hands were just shaking.

620
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:27,012
And I'm saying, Why would you do that. Why would
you steal anything. You have everything.

621
00:35:27,350 --> 00:35:29,716
We give you everything. Why would you steal
anything.

622
00:35:30,061 --> 00:35:32,052
And he says to me. Mom, I've got a lot of problems.

623
00:35:32,396 --> 00:35:36,264
And I'm like, Problems? Really, what kind of
problems could you have?

624
00:35:36,609 --> 00:35:39,521
You're 1 6 years old. You live at home. What kind of
problems could you have.

625
00:35:39,862 --> 00:35:40,942
And he says to me, Mom I'm gay.

626
00:35:41,864 --> 00:35:42,148
Hell no.

627
00:35:42,949 --> 00:35:47,818
So I pull off the road and I turn off the engine and I
say

628
00:35:48,162 --> 00:35:50,027
Fuck. That.

629
00:35:51,207 --> 00:35:54,244
I say, you're going to tell me now after I just picked
you up

630
00:35:54,585 --> 00:35:56,917
at the police station for shoplifting, that you're gay?

631
00:35:57,255 --> 00:35:58,620
Is that some sort of smokescreen?

632
00:35:58,965 --> 00:36:01,581
Like now that you're a homosexual you can run
around stealing shit?

633
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:05,752
I mean, I don't see marauding homosexuals stealing
and pillaging. Do you?

634
00:36:06,138 --> 00:36:07,378
That's when you beat him with the wooden spoon?

635
00:36:07,723 --> 00:36:08,382
Ooh! Here you go!

636
00:36:09,058 --> 00:36:14,303
And that's when I said to you, do you remember, I
said I will have a gay son

637
00:36:14,647 --> 00:36:17,354
that I happen to love very much, in my house.

638
00:36:17,692 --> 00:36:18,977
But I will not have a thief.

639
00:36:20,111 --> 00:36:20,850
Are you done?

640
00:36:24,323 --> 00:36:25,062
Ok.

641
00:36:25,825 --> 00:36:26,610
I'm done now.

642
00:36:27,159 --> 00:36:30,993
Yeah, that's how we deal with things in the
Midwest, so expect that at every family reunion.

643
00:36:31,330 --> 00:36:32,911
Hey! Are you trying to embarrass me?

644
00:36:33,624 --> 00:36:35,034
Because I will come after you.

645
00:36:38,170 --> 00:36:40,081
Gabe, you must have been mortified.

646
00:36:40,631 --> 00:36:45,091
Yes, I was mortified. But that police accounting job
was only part time.

647
00:36:45,553 --> 00:36:49,922
I spent most of my adult life working at a major
financial firm in Cincinnati.

648
00:36:50,808 --> 00:36:51,593
Really?

649
00:36:52,184 --> 00:36:52,889
What firm?

650
00:36:53,686 --> 00:36:54,766
Schuster and Morgan.

651
00:36:56,397 --> 00:36:58,137
Did you ever work for John Schuster?

652
00:36:58,482 --> 00:37:00,018
Oh yeah, that guy was an asshole.

653
00:37:00,359 --> 00:37:01,314
Gabe!

654
00:37:01,652 --> 00:37:02,311
What do you mean, Gabe?

655
00:37:02,778 --> 00:37:04,518
You have just been swearing like a pirate.

656
00:37:05,156 --> 00:37:07,238
Rachel, he's right, that guy was a tool.

657
00:37:07,616 --> 00:37:08,605
When did you start there?

658
00:37:08,951 --> 00:37:09,861
Oh it was a long time ago.

659
00:37:10,328 --> 00:37:12,785
Let me see, see, 1 984 I think.

660
00:37:14,373 --> 00:37:16,989
I interned for John Schuster in the Boston office in
1 985.

661
00:37:17,501 --> 00:37:17,910
Really?

662
00:37:19,003 --> 00:37:20,834
Wow. Small world.

663
00:37:24,091 --> 00:37:29,836
Yeah..um, so what did you say when your son came
out to you...

664
00:37:30,639 --> 00:37:31,754
Sir?

665
00:37:32,475 --> 00:37:37,310
Well, Roger. The Halls are a very proud family.

666
00:37:38,481 --> 00:37:45,603
So I said, Tyler if you're going to be a gay. You be the
best damn gay you can be!

667
00:37:50,159 --> 00:37:51,490
And he is!

668
00:38:01,170 --> 00:38:03,001
I don't know why they can't do one thing right.

669
00:38:03,339 --> 00:38:05,170
I'm gone a freaking weekend.

670
00:38:06,675 --> 00:38:07,539
Ugh.

671
00:38:11,722 --> 00:38:12,802
That was a good dinner though.

672
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:14,971
I almost fell out I was laughing so-

673
00:38:19,105 --> 00:38:20,936
I didn't know we was in an open relationship.

674
00:38:22,149 --> 00:38:23,264
What are you talking about?

675
00:38:23,692 --> 00:38:25,023
You're on that app 24/7.

676
00:38:26,278 --> 00:38:27,814
What? Scruff?

677
00:38:28,155 --> 00:38:28,564
Scruff.

678
00:38:28,948 --> 00:38:30,233
I'm just chatting with friends, Silly.

679
00:38:30,741 --> 00:38:33,107
You're the only one on that application, just
chatting with friends.

680
00:38:34,453 --> 00:38:36,114
Baby. What did I tell you?

681
00:38:37,248 --> 00:38:39,830
I ain't with them. I'm with you, remember?

682
00:38:47,174 --> 00:38:48,084
(knock on door.) Oh no, it can't be.

683
00:38:48,884 --> 00:38:49,373
Who is it?

684
00:38:50,094 --> 00:38:51,049
Steve from Chicago.

685
00:38:51,554 --> 00:38:52,339
Come in.

686
00:38:54,265 --> 00:38:55,129
Perfect timing.

687
00:38:57,643 --> 00:38:58,223
I believe this is yours.

688
00:39:00,438 --> 00:39:02,850
No, that's Jimmy's. It's got a Chicago Bears sticker
on it.

689
00:39:04,191 --> 00:39:05,931
Oh. Does it have a Chicago Bears sticker on it?

690
00:39:06,277 --> 00:39:07,687
I guess we switched it downstairs.

691
00:39:08,154 --> 00:39:09,360
No worries. It was probably Rose.

692
00:39:10,197 --> 00:39:10,811
It's fine.

693
00:39:11,782 --> 00:39:12,988
Hey, is that one of the new ones?

694
00:39:13,325 --> 00:39:14,280
Yeah, baby that's the one he told you about.

695
00:39:14,618 --> 00:39:15,778
The one with the humidifier. Remember?

696
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:20,238
Oh. Damn. If I knew that was up in here I wouldn't
have opened the door.

697
00:39:21,041 --> 00:39:22,076
I would have busted the door down.

698
00:39:22,585 --> 00:39:24,951
I'm just a really light sleeper so this really helps me
out a lot.

699
00:39:25,504 --> 00:39:26,914
It's a real lifesaver.

700
00:39:29,633 --> 00:39:30,292
I bet.

701
00:39:31,177 --> 00:39:31,916
Goodnight boys.

702
00:39:35,973 --> 00:39:36,928
Muscle head.

703
00:39:38,434 --> 00:39:39,719
What? You worried about me?

704
00:39:40,144 --> 00:39:41,759
I can't help if I'm so beautiful.

705
00:39:42,730 --> 00:39:44,140
I bet he wants your humidifier.

706
00:40:06,795 --> 00:40:07,329
Here's your punch.

707
00:40:07,838 --> 00:40:08,827
What you only got me one?

708
00:40:09,298 --> 00:40:09,753
That's all you need.

709
00:40:15,387 --> 00:40:17,719
I really wanted to get here earlier so we could be on
the other side.

710
00:40:23,103 --> 00:40:23,717
I like it here.

711
00:40:24,772 --> 00:40:25,306
You would.

712
00:40:26,398 --> 00:40:27,103
Hey. What's up?

713
00:40:29,401 --> 00:40:30,231
How's it going.

714
00:40:31,111 --> 00:40:31,691
Ty.

715
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:45,247
I think we're fine. We'll stay here, but thanks.

716
00:40:46,043 --> 00:40:50,582
Have it your way. If you change your mind we'll be
over at the meat rack.

717
00:41:03,352 --> 00:41:04,137
You OK?

718
00:41:06,063 --> 00:41:09,021
Hey, I'm going to go with Jack and Ted,

719
00:41:09,316 --> 00:41:10,476
and say hey to Nate and everybody.

720
00:41:10,818 --> 00:41:12,183
Are you ditching me for your ex?

721
00:41:12,528 --> 00:41:14,109
You ditched me yesterday.

722
00:41:14,446 --> 00:41:16,357
One minute you are talking to some fat guy

723
00:41:16,699 --> 00:41:17,905
And then you disappear.

724
00:41:18,409 --> 00:41:19,319
Oh, ok, so you followed me?

725
00:41:19,868 --> 00:41:21,608
No. I didn't follow you, Ty.

726
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:24,286
It's Bear Week. It's the bear community. Everybody
talks.

727
00:41:24,623 --> 00:41:26,079
My parents showed up early, Roger.

728
00:41:26,667 --> 00:41:27,622
Your finger is broken?

729
00:41:28,335 --> 00:41:30,291
Ok. Fine. I'm sorry I should have texted you.

730
00:41:31,005 --> 00:41:32,461
Don't worry about. It's fine. I'll be back.

731
00:41:33,465 --> 00:41:34,796
You serious?

732
00:41:57,239 --> 00:41:59,400
Well if it isn't Mister Soon-To-Be-Hyphenated.

733
00:41:59,992 --> 00:42:01,198
Well if it isn't Big Dan.

734
00:42:01,619 --> 00:42:03,405
At your service.

735
00:42:04,622 --> 00:42:05,862
Beautiful day.

736
00:42:06,874 --> 00:42:08,830
May I?

737
00:42:11,629 --> 00:42:13,870
Please.

738
00:42:17,217 --> 00:42:19,299
Trouble in paradise?

739
00:42:20,095 --> 00:42:20,709
You saw that?

740
00:42:21,597 --> 00:42:22,336
Heard it too.

741
00:42:23,390 --> 00:42:25,255
Fat guy? I am not fat.

742
00:42:25,684 --> 00:42:27,390
Pleasantly plump, maybe.

743
00:42:28,270 --> 00:42:29,385
Gravitationally challenged.

744
00:42:30,356 --> 00:42:31,687
See that sounds negative.

745
00:42:32,483 --> 00:42:35,225
There's more than enough negativity in this
community lately.

746
00:42:35,861 --> 00:42:38,102
Ah, Ok. Buoyantly enhanced.

747
00:42:38,530 --> 00:42:39,770
Ah, there you go.

748
00:42:40,616 --> 00:42:43,198
And speaking of buoyantly enhanced.

749
00:42:48,791 --> 00:42:54,286
(Crowd starts to cheer.)

750
00:42:55,005 --> 00:42:57,291
Anybody need a spare tire?

751
00:43:14,358 --> 00:43:16,474
All right. So tell me. Why the great divide?

752
00:43:17,653 --> 00:43:19,484
You mean between the big guys and the muscle
guys?

753
00:43:20,239 --> 00:43:21,024
I don't know.

754
00:43:21,490 --> 00:43:24,527
Some people say it's aging circuit queens
infiltrating the scene.

755
00:43:25,452 --> 00:43:28,444
Others say it's the insecure fatties throwing the first
stones.

756
00:43:29,915 --> 00:43:32,577
All I know is we need a little more community in this
community.

757
00:43:33,127 --> 00:43:35,163
Woo. Amen, sister.

758
00:43:37,089 --> 00:43:39,125
Bottom's up, bears!

759
00:43:48,308 --> 00:43:50,424
Ok. Now I've seen everything.

760
00:43:50,769 --> 00:43:52,760
Time to flip.

761
00:43:59,987 --> 00:44:01,227
Want me to do your back?

762
00:44:02,823 --> 00:44:06,441
Ok, so the other half of that hyphen is right there.

763
00:44:07,453 --> 00:44:08,488
Good looking guy.

764
00:44:09,955 --> 00:44:11,070
And he's a good man too.

765
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:13,029
I guess that's what important.

766
00:44:13,584 --> 00:44:14,869
Yeah, maybe.

767
00:44:16,044 --> 00:44:19,662
Far be it from me to tell you your business but I
hope it's more than that.

768
00:44:20,007 --> 00:44:21,463
You're getting married.

769
00:44:24,428 --> 00:44:25,543
Yeah. I guess.

770
00:44:27,598 --> 00:44:28,804
So, what's your story?

771
00:44:29,558 --> 00:44:30,764
How long have you got?

772
00:44:31,477 --> 00:44:33,092
How about until the next gong?

773
00:44:34,062 --> 00:44:35,393
I love your sense of humor.

774
00:44:37,816 --> 00:44:38,976
Excuse me

775
00:44:39,777 --> 00:44:40,937
You're in my seat.

776
00:44:41,737 --> 00:44:48,233
Oh. Well. That. That's easily remedied.

777
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:50,735
Sort of...

778
00:44:51,955 --> 00:44:54,241
Congratulations on the wedding. I'm Dan.

779
00:44:55,584 --> 00:44:57,540
Thanks. Roger.

780
00:45:00,297 --> 00:45:01,537
Uh. You got a good man there.

781
00:45:02,424 --> 00:45:03,459
I know.

782
00:45:04,426 --> 00:45:06,667
Well. I'll see you around Tyler.

783
00:45:07,054 --> 00:45:10,342
Hey Dan, so the wedding is Saturday over at Race
Point Beach.

784
00:45:10,682 --> 00:45:12,513
If you want, come on by.

785
00:45:14,853 --> 00:45:15,968
Yeah, any friend ofTyler's...

786
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:18,595
Thanks.

787
00:45:19,566 --> 00:45:23,775
Depends how drunk I get at the BearCity foam
party, but I'll try.

788
00:45:24,321 --> 00:45:24,855
Please do.

789
00:45:25,489 --> 00:45:26,319
See ya.

790
00:45:27,074 --> 00:45:27,984
Nice to meet you.

791
00:45:36,834 --> 00:45:38,244
Uh was that the guy from yesterday?

792
00:45:38,627 --> 00:45:40,367
Yup.

793
00:45:49,137 --> 00:45:50,422
All right Rog. Listen.

794
00:45:52,808 --> 00:45:54,764
I'm sorry that I ditched you yesterday. Ok.

795
00:45:57,563 --> 00:46:03,354
I'm sorry too. I mean if my parents were still alive
and

796
00:46:03,694 --> 00:46:06,811
wandering around BearWeek I'm sure I would be
acting the same way.

797
00:46:07,990 --> 00:46:09,480
Thank you.

798
00:46:10,033 --> 00:46:14,276
All right bears! Show me some wood!

799
00:46:18,041 --> 00:46:19,997
Oh, shut that fucking gong up.

800
00:46:24,423 --> 00:46:27,210
I am bored. I'm so bored.

801
00:46:27,759 --> 00:46:29,875
There's a party outside, and we're inside. Yay!

802
00:46:30,220 --> 00:46:31,255
Would you please stop.

803
00:46:31,597 --> 00:46:32,928
I'm so bored baby. Where's this guy?

804
00:46:33,265 --> 00:46:35,551
He just texted. He said he's going to be here any
second now.

805
00:46:38,353 --> 00:46:40,184
-Yeah, that was like 20 minutes ago. So I don't
believe it.
-Would you please chill out sweetheart, you're
making me nervous.

806
00:46:40,522 --> 00:46:44,561
-Does he know what you look like?
-He's gonna know who we are when he gets here
so...

807
00:46:48,363 --> 00:46:53,858
Oh, they didn't tell me you'd be such a hot bear!

808
00:46:55,329 --> 00:46:56,660
Woof!

809
00:46:57,497 --> 00:47:00,330
Um, this is my partner Brent. Hello.

810
00:47:00,667 --> 00:47:03,625
Oh. Scott-O. Scott with an O.

811
00:47:03,962 --> 00:47:05,293
Business partners?

812
00:47:05,631 --> 00:47:06,620
Uh, no, the regular kind.

813
00:47:07,215 --> 00:47:10,457
Oh, I get it so you want to keep your space.

814
00:47:10,802 --> 00:47:16,638
So what I think we should do, I think we put all the
people to one side that we think represent the
community

815
00:47:18,894 --> 00:47:24,730
But I don't want to use anybody old or fat. I want
the better-looking guys. It couldn't hurt right?

816
00:47:26,068 --> 00:47:31,779
-OK, I'm tracking with that. I like better-looking
guys.
-Happy, up guys.

817
00:47:32,407 --> 00:47:35,069
Oh look how about these two?

818
00:47:35,911 --> 00:47:38,448
I don't like chicken and rice. That's not going to
happen.

819
00:47:39,039 --> 00:47:44,124
Oh look at this one. Hello! I'm single just in case
you're wondering. Come on over here, come on
over here.

820
00:47:44,544 --> 00:47:47,502
Let's shoot this guy. Can you roll the camera please?
-Yeah, sure.

821
00:47:48,131 --> 00:47:49,371
This is my show.

822
00:47:50,342 --> 00:47:52,424
Just give me some levels.
-Some what?

823
00:47:52,803 --> 00:47:54,794
Some levels. Just talk normally into the mic please--

824
00:47:55,138 --> 00:47:57,470
Somebody hasn't done this before.

825
00:47:57,808 --> 00:47:58,342
Shh! Stop.

826
00:47:58,684 --> 00:47:59,548
What's your name?

827
00:47:59,893 --> 00:48:00,757
Denny.

828
00:48:02,437 --> 00:48:08,728
I could lap you up like some biscuits and gravy.

829
00:48:09,069 --> 00:48:10,809
Look I was just on my way to the pool so-

830
00:48:11,154 --> 00:48:13,566
Well if you need a shower my room is upstairs.

831
00:48:13,907 --> 00:48:18,617
Uh, so we got all that we need to do with helping
him find some dick so...

832
00:48:18,954 --> 00:48:19,443
Stop it!

833
00:48:19,788 --> 00:48:22,621
So let's try to get more of a human interest story.

834
00:48:26,378 --> 00:48:27,743
Oh my god, that ass, it's heaven.

835
00:48:30,841 --> 00:48:33,048
You know what, hold on. Hey! Guys.

836
00:48:33,427 --> 00:48:34,633
Hey, how are you. I'm Brent.

837
00:48:34,970 --> 00:48:38,758
I was just going to, I saw your shirts and I was
wondering how long you guys have been together.

838
00:48:39,099 --> 00:48:40,214
1 9 years.

839
00:48:40,559 --> 00:48:42,220
That's amazing. That's great.

840
00:48:44,938 --> 00:48:48,931
My partner Fred over here is doing a little
documentary about bears. Crazy idea, right?

841
00:48:49,818 --> 00:48:53,106
That is why I love him so much. He thinks when I
can't.

842
00:48:53,530 --> 00:48:54,485
We would like to get you in there.

843
00:48:54,823 --> 00:48:57,189
-Oh, I don't know.
-Oh, come on Cole, let's do it.

844
00:48:58,076 --> 00:48:59,657
See how he gets me?

845
00:49:00,537 --> 00:49:03,529
I don't know why we have to use old people.

846
00:49:04,082 --> 00:49:07,165
Um, this is Fred. And this is Scott.

847
00:49:07,544 --> 00:49:11,457
O! Scott-O.
-Scott Oh-my god.

848
00:49:11,923 --> 00:49:16,462
You guys ready? So this is Cole and Gary.

849
00:49:16,928 --> 00:49:18,884
Baby, that was amazing. Thank you.

850
00:49:19,556 --> 00:49:23,219
All right. So. Um...what do I ask them?

851
00:49:23,894 --> 00:49:26,727
Start with, How long have you guys been together?

852
00:49:27,064 --> 00:49:29,806
-Well that's compelling since it's on their t-shirt but
whatev-
-How did you meet?

853
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:31,435
Right. How did ya meet?

854
00:49:33,153 --> 00:49:39,615
Well, when we met there was no online. So we had
to do it the old fashioned way.

855
00:49:39,951 --> 00:49:43,819
How?
-At a truck stop.

856
00:49:45,707 --> 00:49:49,416
I met this guy from Nacogdoches at a truck stop!

857
00:49:49,878 --> 00:49:55,373
He was 6'5and he had this, oh god, he had a
scholong that was THIS big. I swear.

858
00:49:55,801 --> 00:49:59,214
I went to his truck, I didn't walk straight for a week.
Yeah.

859
00:50:01,681 --> 00:50:06,801
Oh. Well. I guess they had some place to go. That
was rude.

860
00:50:07,479 --> 00:50:11,313
I told you we shouldn't use seniors. Sometimes they
forget where they are.

861
00:50:14,194 --> 00:50:16,776
-I will have a pink one.
-I will have an entire tray.

862
00:50:17,114 --> 00:50:22,234
Here you go. And this is for you. -Thank you so
much. Thank you very much and thank you for
visiting Scott Cakes.

863
00:50:22,577 --> 00:50:23,817
These must kill at BearWeek.

864
00:50:24,162 --> 00:50:26,153
Every week should be BearWeek.

865
00:50:28,875 --> 00:50:30,035
You need to fire that host guy.

866
00:50:31,002 --> 00:50:32,242
I can't fire him.
-Fire him.

867
00:50:32,712 --> 00:50:34,794
His husband is paying for the whole thing. I can't
fire him.

868
00:50:35,132 --> 00:50:37,748
Can you care about anything enough to just fight
for it?

869
00:50:38,093 --> 00:50:38,798
I fight for things.

870
00:50:39,136 --> 00:50:41,502
No you don't. You don't fight for anything. It sort of
just happens to you.

871
00:50:41,847 --> 00:50:44,338
Just because I'm not a control freak doesn't mean I
don't care.

872
00:50:44,683 --> 00:50:49,768
But you are a controller. Let us not forget the great
open relationship diaster.

873
00:50:50,105 --> 00:50:52,312
How did this suddenly become about our
relationship?

874
00:50:53,817 --> 00:50:59,232
Well you tabled the marriage conversation right
when it became legal. And that was your whole
excuse before, that it wasn't legal.

875
00:50:59,573 --> 00:51:02,815
Brent, you're sounding just like Reggie right now.
-Please don't do that, I don't like being compared to
your ex.

876
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:05,196
Yeah well stop acting like him then, ok?

877
00:51:05,537 --> 00:51:08,119
I am not going to be pushed into marriage just
because it's legal now.

878
00:51:08,456 --> 00:51:13,041
No, but you will be pushed into working with a
pompous pig whose ready to ruin your dream.
Because you're OK with that. And that's how you
are.

879
00:51:13,378 --> 00:51:17,166
Those are two completely different things, Brent.
-No they are not.
-Fred this is your dream. Open your hand.

880
00:51:17,507 --> 00:51:19,793
Put your hand out.
-What?
-That. That's your film. Ok?

881
00:51:20,135 --> 00:51:23,548
It's perfect. It's made with passion. It's made with
love, right? -Right, right?
-Yes.

882
00:51:26,975 --> 00:51:28,840
Well, that's what that guy is going to do to your
movie.

883
00:51:29,436 --> 00:51:30,972
Splatter it on the pavement.

884
00:51:41,239 --> 00:51:45,323
Sorry! I'm sorry, was that too much?

885
00:51:45,952 --> 00:51:48,910
No. Sweetie, it was good.

886
00:51:49,998 --> 00:51:51,738
I'm good with a visual metaphor.

887
00:51:52,626 --> 00:51:53,581
I know.

888
00:51:54,628 --> 00:51:55,617
I like that.

889
00:51:55,962 --> 00:51:57,953
I know. Let's go eat this.

890
00:51:58,298 --> 00:52:00,880
Let's get stoned first.
-Oh. Let's get drunk and stoned.

891
00:52:01,218 --> 00:52:02,708
I'll just get drunk. -I'll get stoned.

892
00:52:03,053 --> 00:52:08,844
Mmm, this is so beautiful. Isn't it?

893
00:52:15,649 --> 00:52:17,890
I know you. What's wrong?

894
00:52:19,986 --> 00:52:22,102
The oak bar top came in and it was basically
destroyed in transit.

895
00:52:23,990 --> 00:52:29,860
-Oh no.
-Yeah, it's going to take another 30 days to
manufacture. Another 1 0 to ship.

896
00:52:30,497 --> 00:52:32,909
That obviously blows our chances of opening on
Labor Day.

897
00:52:33,250 --> 00:52:35,992
Oh, baby...I'm so sorry.
-Yeah.
-When did you find out?

898
00:52:36,336 --> 00:52:38,418
-This morning.
-Why didn't you tell me?

899
00:52:38,964 --> 00:52:39,953
Because you were on the phone.

900
00:52:42,634 --> 00:52:47,048
Carlos, I know that this show is consuming me, but
as soon as it opens...

901
00:52:47,389 --> 00:52:52,509
Michael, save it. Ok? I know that doing this makes
you happy. I'm not going to sabotage that. I just...

902
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:58,981
I just wish we could have some boundaries. You
know?

903
00:52:59,526 --> 00:53:02,734
Oh, I know this is terrible timing baby, but I have to
take this one call.

904
00:53:03,071 --> 00:53:04,481
Are you fucking serious?

905
00:53:05,573 --> 00:53:09,907
Hey hey. Carlos! Carlos Cantoni DeLa Cruz don't you
dare-ugh! Look, I...

906
00:53:11,079 --> 00:53:14,037
Don't you answer that. Don't you fucking answer
that. Don't you dare.

907
00:53:17,168 --> 00:53:22,083
I said I would appreciate some boundaries. Michael,
ok? Look where we are.

908
00:53:23,216 --> 00:53:28,552
If we can't spend some alone time on a sliver of rock
in the middle of the fucking ocean then what's the
point?

909
00:53:29,347 --> 00:53:30,587
Tell me.

910
00:53:37,105 --> 00:53:38,595
You're right. I apologize

911
00:53:39,566 --> 00:53:45,027
Come here. Come here and cuddle with me. Sorry.

912
00:53:48,283 --> 00:53:52,026
Oh! You bitch!
-I told you I wouldn't sabotage you, Gordito.

913
00:53:53,663 --> 00:53:56,279
-I know.
-You know what I mean?
-I understand.

914
00:53:57,208 --> 00:53:59,073
Bitch.

915
00:54:04,883 --> 00:54:07,590
Anyway, sorry for overreacting. This whole bar thing
has got me worked up.

916
00:54:07,927 --> 00:54:11,090
Well can't we special order it? Can't we have it sent
overnight? We can spend the money.

917
00:54:11,431 --> 00:54:14,423
I don't care right now. I just want to enjoy the view.

918
00:54:17,062 --> 00:54:18,142
Me too.

919
00:54:20,732 --> 00:54:24,441
[Phone vibrates] Oh it's the bar guys.

920
00:54:25,111 --> 00:54:28,194
Seriously?
-Yeah. Yeah what the hell happened?

921
00:54:30,825 --> 00:54:31,985
[Phone vibrates] All right. Hey, hey.

922
00:54:32,702 --> 00:54:34,033
Yeah yeah. You're damn right I'm pissed.

923
00:54:34,496 --> 00:54:36,111
No no no. You guys have the wrong props list-

924
00:54:36,915 --> 00:54:38,200
Ask Esby...

925
00:54:38,625 --> 00:54:40,035
I don't want to hear it. That's unacceptable.

926
00:54:40,377 --> 00:54:41,583
I don't want to hear that.

927
00:54:42,128 --> 00:54:44,119
You're not going to blow this opening. You hear
me?

928
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:48,707
I don't want to hear it.

929
00:54:53,264 --> 00:54:56,051
Oooh. I see fingers.

930
00:54:56,393 --> 00:54:57,724
One foot in front of the other. All right we're almost
there.

931
00:54:59,104 --> 00:55:02,016
Da da dadada da.
-Careful, careful!
-Whhaaa What was that?

932
00:55:02,357 --> 00:55:03,221
ShhShhShh!

933
00:55:03,566 --> 00:55:06,182
-All right keep going.
-It's like a haunted house.

934
00:55:06,653 --> 00:55:07,984
Keep going we're almost there.

935
00:55:08,321 --> 00:55:10,403
I am serving you, Helen Keller.

936
00:55:11,241 --> 00:55:12,777
Ok. There.

937
00:55:13,118 --> 00:55:14,107
Yeah.Yeah.

938
00:55:14,577 --> 00:55:17,068
Here we go. One -Two -Two

939
00:55:17,414 --> 00:55:22,329
-Three!
-Water!
-No, look.
-Whale watching!

940
00:55:22,836 --> 00:55:26,078
Oh. Baby! But isn't that expensive?

941
00:55:26,673 --> 00:55:28,914
Yeah. But you are so worth it.

942
00:55:30,218 --> 00:55:33,210
Oh-isn't this a misappropriation of Sugar Daddy's
money? -Mhm? -Ok.

943
00:55:51,114 --> 00:55:52,103
Hello.

944
00:55:52,907 --> 00:55:57,276
Hey. I'm Jake. That's my partner Ken. Which one of
you guys is Fred?

945
00:55:57,787 --> 00:55:58,742
I'm Fred.

946
00:55:59,164 --> 00:56:02,122
Great. Great to meet you.
-You too.

947
00:56:02,542 --> 00:56:03,577
Nate sent you right?

948
00:56:03,918 --> 00:56:05,909
Yes. He did.
-All right.

949
00:56:06,546 --> 00:56:09,663
Jake, let's get this party started.
-Yes, sir.

950
00:56:20,852 --> 00:56:23,093
We are loose, Captain.

951
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:26,768
Don't tell me. We are interviewing them for the
documentary.

952
00:56:27,108 --> 00:56:31,147
Yep. And all is right in the world of money
management.

953
00:56:31,654 --> 00:56:36,148
-Is Scott O coming? Tell me he's not coming.
-Baby I have something to tell you.
-Huh?

954
00:56:36,868 --> 00:56:39,905
I let him go today.
-No!
-Yup. Fired.

955
00:56:40,538 --> 00:56:41,493
What did he say?

956
00:56:42,165 --> 00:56:45,874
He said, Oh you'll be hearing from my husband ya
ya ya. That guy's such a douche bear.

957
00:56:47,337 --> 00:56:49,999
So proud of you. Good.
-Thank you sweetheart.
-Get rid of him!

958
00:56:50,381 --> 00:56:51,541
Yay! -Yeah! -Gone!

959
00:56:51,883 --> 00:56:52,963
Whales!

960
00:56:54,928 --> 00:56:56,793
This is amazing!

961
00:57:04,854 --> 00:57:06,219
Where's that guy from?

962
00:57:06,689 --> 00:57:08,771
I don't think he's from Cape Cod... He has a bit of an
accent.

963
00:57:10,068 --> 00:57:11,148
I vant to pahk the cah in Haahvard Yaaahd.

964
00:57:11,528 --> 00:57:14,019
Park ze car in Haahvard Yaaahd.

965
00:57:14,906 --> 00:57:16,737
Woohoo!

966
00:57:38,429 --> 00:57:41,296
Take your shirt off. Come on.

967
00:57:47,021 --> 00:57:49,854
Yay. Woo!

968
00:57:59,450 --> 00:58:01,441
Fred! A whale!

969
00:58:01,828 --> 00:58:05,161
Where? Let me get my camera.

970
00:58:05,707 --> 00:58:07,163
It's already gone.

971
00:58:08,042 --> 00:58:09,532
Do you see anything.

972
00:58:09,961 --> 00:58:11,917
Yeah. A fucking light house.

973
00:58:12,213 --> 00:58:14,829
Oh, there's two lighthouses.

974
00:58:17,427 --> 00:58:19,668
Keep your eyes peeled sweetie.

975
00:58:23,850 --> 00:58:27,342
Hey! What's going on?
-You said Nate sent you right?
-Yeah he did.

976
00:58:29,397 --> 00:58:32,764
Oh.That was my nipple. Thank you. Sorry. Whoops.

977
00:58:33,109 --> 00:58:35,225
Uh..Fred.

978
00:58:36,446 --> 00:58:37,936
Fred! Fred! Oh!

979
00:58:38,489 --> 00:58:39,478
Down boy!

980
00:58:39,824 --> 00:58:42,065
You know I think there might be a
misunderstanding....

981
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:57,338
Get your hand off me! I'm slipping here. Stop it!

982
00:58:57,675 --> 00:59:00,963
Watch the feet. Watch the... FRED!!!

983
00:59:01,304 --> 00:59:03,420
Shit! He can't swim! -what is wrong with you
guy-oh, fuck!

984
00:59:04,265 --> 00:59:04,970
Fred!

985
00:59:06,559 --> 00:59:09,050
Fred!

986
00:59:10,897 --> 00:59:12,353
Fred!

987
00:59:12,982 --> 00:59:14,438
Fred!

988
00:59:18,780 --> 00:59:19,815
Jake, Jake. Come on. Come on.

989
00:59:20,531 --> 00:59:21,316
Oh! Oh!

990
00:59:29,791 --> 00:59:30,951
It's OK.

991
00:59:35,588 --> 00:59:36,498
Hey sorry guys.

992
00:59:37,590 --> 00:59:40,332
Yeah, me too. I thought you said Nate sent you.

993
00:59:40,885 --> 00:59:43,001
Yeah, actually a friend of Nate's did send us.

994
00:59:43,930 --> 00:59:47,297
He just didn't tell us about the happy ending.
-Randy?
-Yeah

995
00:59:47,642 --> 00:59:48,677
Oh my god I'm going to kill that guy.

996
00:59:49,018 --> 00:59:51,009
Hey Jake, let's just get on with the tour all right?

997
00:59:53,398 --> 00:59:55,684
Yes, sir.

998
01:00:00,405 --> 01:00:01,394
Hey.

999
01:00:02,365 --> 01:00:03,400
Yeah?

1000
01:00:03,741 --> 01:00:05,277
Thanks for saving me.

1001
01:00:06,411 --> 01:00:08,618
Very romantic. Damsel in distress and all.

1002
01:00:12,166 --> 01:00:14,452
I lost my camera.

1003
01:00:16,838 --> 01:00:19,295
It went overboard when I jumped in to get you.

1004
01:00:21,050 --> 01:00:22,335
Doid you lose a lot of footage?

1005
01:00:23,136 --> 01:00:25,422
NO. Just what I shot this morning.

1006
01:00:26,514 --> 01:00:30,132
I just really wanted to get a shot of a whale. You
know, jumping up in the air.

1007
01:00:30,518 --> 01:00:32,554
It almost never happens.

1008
01:00:43,072 --> 01:00:44,437
So, are you going to ask about my day?

1009
01:00:44,782 --> 01:00:46,443
How was your day, baby?
-It was amazing.
-Really?

1010
01:00:46,743 --> 01:00:49,610
So we went out with Randy's friends. The guys from
the what do you call it...

1011
01:00:50,580 --> 01:00:53,037
Use your words. -Boat
-The boat.

1012
01:00:53,458 --> 01:00:55,323
And we were standing on the edge of the boat
which is called a...

1013
01:00:55,752 --> 01:00:57,242
Starburst.
-Starfish

1014
01:00:58,921 --> 01:01:04,166
-And it got a little porno-y!
-With a stranger?

1015
01:01:05,636 --> 01:01:11,302
And I fell off the boat, and you know I can't swim
because you never paid for those lessons.

1016
01:01:12,018 --> 01:01:17,684
I did. You didn't want to mess up your hair.
-You just wanted turquoise jewelry.

1017
01:01:18,941 --> 01:01:23,981
Well, Fred jumped in and he saved me, it was so
romantic.

1018
01:01:24,322 --> 01:01:29,737
Except for the almost dying part and the two
thousand dollar camera that did its own little
Titanic.
-Wow, sounds like a real Prince Charming.

1019
01:01:30,745 --> 01:01:38,288
Without the charm. Or the horse. Or the chaps. Oh!
With the chaps.

1020
01:01:39,128 --> 01:01:46,296
-I like Frederick.
-He hates when you call him that.
-Really?
-Did you forget?

1021
01:01:47,261 --> 01:01:55,100
We talked all week about standing up and fighting
for things.You think it's cheesy, I think it's amazing.

1022
01:01:56,437 --> 01:02:07,109
He had a choice to make and he chose me.
-He did. Over a camera. (sarcastically) That's
fantastic. Listen to yourself!

1023
01:02:07,448 --> 01:02:08,358
-he chose you over his camera.

1024
01:02:10,952 --> 01:02:16,663
It's just a metaphor
-Maybe it's time for you to just think about maybe
moving on.
-Jesus!
-No really.

1025
01:02:17,834 --> 01:02:31,805
You are special. You know, more special than some
piece of plastic with a flashbulb.

1026
01:02:32,473 --> 01:02:46,444
Fred has commitment issues-
-That's a bull-shitty excuse, I don't buy it. And PS,
you're not his ex. Not yet, anyway.

1027
01:02:46,737 --> 01:02:47,647
Oh my god! You are a terrible mother, you have no
maternal insticts at all.

1028
01:02:48,239 --> 01:02:53,984
Listen, I am telling you. How long are you going to
stay,

1029
01:02:55,288 --> 01:03:03,286
in a relationship where the other person isn't
committed? Look how handsome you are.

1030
01:03:04,797 --> 01:03:06,128
Come on.

1031
01:03:07,133 --> 01:03:09,545
You don't want to end up an old lonely hag, right?

1032
01:03:10,428 --> 01:03:14,091
Do they have a more masculine term for that?
-An old lonely fag.

1033
01:03:17,935 --> 01:03:21,223
This town is so beautiful. They kept calling him
Daddy.

1034
01:03:23,941 --> 01:03:25,181
I had to protect my man.

1035
01:03:26,027 --> 01:03:26,561
You go girl!

1036
01:03:28,237 --> 01:03:30,148
Ooooh. May I?

1037
01:03:31,949 --> 01:03:36,318
Oh yeah.
-That is so pretty, where'd you get that?

1038
01:03:37,330 --> 01:03:46,079
Well, Brian -Brent's dad-and I, spent some time in
San Francisco on a commune. We fell in with these
fantastic wild hippies.

1039
01:03:47,632 --> 01:03:50,044
Well it was the 1 970s, so they weren't really hippies.

1040
01:03:50,343 --> 01:03:51,833
(sarcastic) I think she was asking me, but go ahead,
we'll wait.

1041
01:03:52,553 --> 01:03:58,549
Anyway. They were fantastic, and they made these
rings out of different shades of gold.

1042
01:03:59,685 --> 01:04:06,397
They would layer the gold like that and form waves.
Look here.

1043
01:04:07,693 --> 01:04:09,399
Here. Look. Do you see the waves?

1044
01:04:09,737 --> 01:04:11,352
That is gorgeous.

1045
01:04:11,697 --> 01:04:17,158
So they taught us how to do it, and Brian and I
made one for each other.

1046
01:04:18,329 --> 01:04:20,945
It was a long time ago. It was really fun.

1047
01:04:21,916 --> 01:04:23,406
Why do you wear it around your neck?

1048
01:04:23,751 --> 01:04:24,615
Gabe-

1049
01:04:24,961 --> 01:04:26,701
No. That's a good question.

1050
01:04:27,713 --> 01:04:29,123
I don't know.

1051
01:04:29,924 --> 01:04:32,506
I think maybe, because it's closer to my heart.

1052
01:04:34,845 --> 01:04:36,301
That's so nice.

1053
01:04:37,014 --> 01:04:45,558
[sex sounds]

1054
01:04:45,898 --> 01:04:48,059
The Chicago boys?

1055
01:04:49,151 --> 01:04:51,233
Where do you find a bed that big?

1056
01:04:53,072 --> 01:04:54,312
Really?

1057
01:04:54,782 --> 01:04:56,613
Just asking?

1058
01:05:10,131 --> 01:05:12,417
Spa Day!

1059
01:05:16,762 --> 01:05:18,718
I cannot wait to get this massage.

1060
01:05:20,683 --> 01:05:24,346
Hey guys. Thank you.

1061
01:05:26,689 --> 01:05:28,896
I love you too.

1062
01:05:30,109 --> 01:05:31,770
Let's hear it for Ty and spa day, boys.

1063
01:05:39,285 --> 01:05:42,277
Wait until you see this massager guy I picked out for
you.

1064
01:05:42,788 --> 01:05:43,777
It's masseuse, Lance Bass.

1065
01:05:44,248 --> 01:05:45,533
Whatever, Scruff Boy.

1066
01:05:45,875 --> 01:05:47,866
Ok relax. It's actually a massage therapist.

1067
01:05:48,210 --> 01:05:50,667
No, no. it's a masseusiologist.

1068
01:05:51,964 --> 01:05:54,330
Of course, I'd rather die than have those hairy paws
touch me but...

1069
01:05:54,675 --> 01:05:56,836
I think you're going to be stoked.

1070
01:05:59,138 --> 01:06:02,380
He's like your kind of cute.

1071
01:06:03,559 --> 01:06:06,926
He's too skinny forTyler.
-Too skinny? He was like a wafer thin mintaway from
a heart attack.

1072
01:06:07,772 --> 01:06:10,980
Ok, well you and I have very different views on body
size.

1073
01:06:12,943 --> 01:06:15,605
-Obviously.
-What about you Mariquita? You find your twink
yet?

1074
01:06:15,946 --> 01:06:20,235
A: Fuck you, and B: Let me check..

1075
01:06:23,245 --> 01:06:24,735
Oh. My. God.

1076
01:06:25,206 --> 01:06:26,867
The bears are eating the twinks.

1077
01:06:27,958 --> 01:06:30,415
No, there's like, just one left.

1078
01:06:30,836 --> 01:06:32,121
Ah, and he's ten feet away.

1079
01:06:36,926 --> 01:06:38,791
He's cute too.

1080
01:06:40,012 --> 01:06:47,054
Ray... Simon and Ray. It's got a nice ring to it,
doesn't it?
-Not a chance.

1081
01:06:47,812 --> 01:06:50,019
What? It's my fantasy, you don't have to-

1082
01:06:53,192 --> 01:06:56,309
This is hell. I'm in hell.

1083
01:07:00,908 --> 01:07:03,741
Ok. Now that pocket cub was cute.

1084
01:07:04,036 --> 01:07:05,776
Did you just say pocket cub'?

1085
01:07:06,080 --> 01:07:07,866
Wow. Learning the lingo, Si?

1086
01:07:08,457 --> 01:07:09,617
It's kind of like travelling abroad.

1087
01:07:13,087 --> 01:07:17,046
I'm going to go get laid.

1088
01:07:21,095 --> 01:07:21,800
Oh shit.

1089
01:07:22,763 --> 01:07:25,926
Fred.

1090
01:07:27,810 --> 01:07:28,970
Hey Reggie.

1091
01:07:30,980 --> 01:07:37,852
Oh, this is my husband, Johnny. This is my ex, Fred.

1092
01:07:38,154 --> 01:07:39,064
Fred had commitment issues when we were
together didn't ya Fred.

1093
01:07:39,572 --> 01:07:42,689
You still with that uh, skinny-
-Brent
-Yeah, Brent. You still with Brent?

1094
01:07:43,826 --> 01:07:46,989
We're still together.

1095
01:07:47,288 --> 01:07:51,452
Wow. It's a long time, huh?
-Six years.
-Six Years!

1096
01:07:52,042 --> 01:07:59,210
That's like a world record for you, isn't it Fred?
Where is he?

1097
01:08:00,301 --> 01:08:03,793
He's at a different bachelor party.

1098
01:08:05,931 --> 01:08:10,300
-Bachelor party? You getting married, Fred?
-Not us.
-No. I didn't think so.
-No that would be me.

1099
01:08:10,895 --> 01:08:17,312
Is that you?
-Hey, I think this guy wants to dance.

1100
01:08:17,610 --> 01:08:20,352
Drop it.
-Seriously Fred, why are you still taking shit from
this jerk?
-I said drop it.

1101
01:08:20,779 --> 01:08:23,236
(off camera) Fred Richards?
-That's my appointment. I gotta go.

1102
01:08:23,699 --> 01:08:29,410
Of course you got to go, have a good massage, get a
happy ending while you're at it.

1103
01:08:30,748 --> 01:08:31,828
Piece of shit.

1104
01:08:32,708 --> 01:08:34,744
-Who is this guy?
-He's a fucking jerk.

1105
01:08:35,920 --> 01:08:36,909
Tyler?

1106
01:08:37,838 --> 01:08:42,377
Hi. No. That's me. I will go with you, Daddy.... I will
go with him....

1107
01:08:43,844 --> 01:08:47,462
-A happy ending is still cheating, Tyler.
-Yeah, thanks Carlos.

1108
01:09:05,032 --> 01:09:08,320
Yeah, god this is just what I needed.

1109
01:09:09,036 --> 01:09:11,072
Yeah, usually I don't get to open her up like this.

1110
01:09:11,372 --> 01:09:12,282
Usually it's just boring tour groups and noisy kids.

1111
01:09:13,457 --> 01:09:14,367
Open her up. Really?

1112
01:09:15,125 --> 01:09:17,537
Still nasty.
-Bet your ass.

1113
01:09:18,003 --> 01:09:19,539
Had you had heard what is said up there?

1114
01:09:19,880 --> 01:09:22,121
I has have tried to block it out.

1115
01:09:22,633 --> 01:09:23,918
Yay. Sand.

1116
01:09:32,309 --> 01:09:35,016
Carlos is on Scruff again!

1117
01:09:35,688 --> 01:09:38,976
-Oh my god!
-What?
-You got service out here!

1118
01:09:39,775 --> 01:09:41,891
And he's surrounded by fatties.
-No, it doesn't work like that.

1119
01:09:42,778 --> 01:09:49,240
That's you. That's how far they are from you. So they
may not be anywhere near him.

1120
01:09:49,576 --> 01:09:52,363
...and you knew he had a Scruff account, so stop
freaking out
-I knew he had an account...

1121
01:09:53,372 --> 01:09:55,033
but I thought we had an agreement.

1122
01:10:00,754 --> 01:10:02,836
Oh hell no!

1123
01:10:03,465 --> 01:10:06,423
Yup, now you are screwed. They are coming after
him like rabid Oompa Loompahs.

1124
01:10:07,136 --> 01:10:08,717
Nate, turn this car around.
-What?

01:10:09,471 --> 01:10:13,089
You just calm down up there, all right Old Man
River? Keep flirting with FatherTime.

1126
01:10:14,268 --> 01:10:17,886
Thanks for the magical tour of sand dunes! Here's
the deal--

1127
01:10:18,314 --> 01:10:23,274
Carlos is like a sand dune. Natural, god made it, and
once in a while you find a dirty condom in it.
-I hate you.

1128
01:10:24,528 --> 01:10:29,488
Listen Carlos loves you, he's not going to eat fried
chicken off anyone else's belly.

1129
01:10:30,075 --> 01:10:34,990
I don't think that's really funny right now. Nate can
we go back. I need to go back.

1130
01:10:36,749 --> 01:10:37,864
Hold up. We're almost there.

1131
01:10:38,208 --> 01:10:44,920
-Almost where?
-You didn't think driving in the sand was going to be
the sum total of your bachelor party, did you?

No way!

1135

I didn't think it could get better than sand, but I
have picked the right bachelor party!

have commitment issues.

Mmmm. Feels really good.

1143
01:12:38,203 --> 01:12:39,693
Marriage is a big step.

1144
01:12:40,038 --> 01:12:43,747
Something I want to be careful about. You don't just
jump into a marriage.

Don't worry about pushing too hard because I can
take it.

Its so weird that of all the people in my life, you're
the one organizing my bachelor party.

1154
01:13:34,426 --> 01:13:40,046
I got to say though, this was furthest thing from my
mind less than a week ago.

1155
01:13:40,849 --> 01:13:46,139
I just can't believe you, of all people, are about to
settle down with just one guy.

1156
01:13:47,231 --> 01:13:48,846
I'm ready.

1157

I'm not getting any younger.

1158
01:13:53,403 --> 01:13:55,689
I've been playing the field ever since you and I
broke up.

Falling for Tyler took me by surprise, I did all I could
to resist it

1160
01:14:05,832 --> 01:14:07,413
but I'm in love with him.

1161
01:14:09,586 --> 01:14:11,167
It's so different from me and you.

1162
01:14:11,588 --> 01:14:17,333
It's like being in a relationship with my best friend.

1163

Are you sure that's not all he is?

1164
01:14:21,723 --> 01:14:23,008
I've heard that line before.

1165
01:14:23,850 --> 01:14:25,636
We were different, Nate.

1166
01:14:26,270 --> 01:14:29,182
We were the envy of everyone in New York City.

1167
01:14:29,648 --> 01:14:32,230
We slept with everyone in New York City.

1168
01:14:32,776 --> 01:14:35,062
And we stayed together way longer than we should
have.

1169
01:14:35,487 --> 01:14:36,226
Oh, what Is that supposed to mean?

1170
01:14:36,697 --> 01:14:41,657
It was a constant competition between us. We were
never honest. We weren't monogamous... we were
always fighting.

1171
01:14:43,120 --> 01:14:44,530
We had great sex.

1172
01:14:45,414 --> 01:14:47,245
And we laughed all the time.

1173
01:14:51,295 --> 01:14:52,660
It was too much work, Nate.

1174
01:14:53,797 --> 01:14:59,588
With Tyler it's easy. He's impressionable, young,
smart.

1175
01:15:02,973 --> 01:15:05,680
I've got to say it's nice being the older man.

1176
01:15:06,310 --> 01:15:07,971
Being his mentor.

1177
01:15:09,146 --> 01:15:10,886
You sound like a schoolteacher.

1178
01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:14,307
Well in some ways, I am. You were the same way for
me when we were together.

1179
01:15:15,485 --> 01:15:16,725
I kind of owe you my life.

1180
01:15:17,613 --> 01:15:18,853
Wow. Is that a compliment coming from you?

1181
01:15:22,242 --> 01:15:23,152
Shut it.

1182
01:15:24,202 --> 01:15:27,239
I'm serious. You're always so consistent about being
safe.

1183
01:15:27,914 --> 01:15:30,826
God knows after all the crazy shit we did. I've
done...

1184
01:15:31,376 --> 01:15:34,459
...to still be negative.

1185
01:15:36,256 --> 01:15:37,245
Um-

1186
01:15:38,342 --> 01:15:41,175
Oh, that was stupid. I just assumed.

1187
01:15:41,511 --> 01:15:44,253
No. I'm still negative. But after two years,

1188
01:15:45,641 --> 01:15:52,763
I would hope that wouldn't be the only thing you
took away from our relationship.

1189
01:15:59,696 --> 01:16:00,776
Don't do this, Nate.

1190
01:16:02,532 --> 01:16:06,366
I love him. I haven't cheated on him yet, I'm not
going to.

1191
01:16:07,913 --> 01:16:12,327
Hey guys!

1192
01:16:12,959 --> 01:16:17,293
I hate to break up this little stroll down Don't tell my
lovers lane

1193
01:16:17,756 --> 01:16:20,213
but the Bear City foam party's just getting' started
and Randy's feelin' dirty. Lets go. Lets go.

1194
01:17:11,601 --> 01:17:16,391
Ok guys now we have to stick together in this thing
or we are gonna lose each other...

1195
01:17:19,735 --> 01:17:20,474
Fred?

1196
01:17:21,570 --> 01:17:23,356
Carlos?

1197
01:17:39,045 --> 01:17:40,660
Jesus!

1198
01:17:42,591 --> 01:17:44,798
Well look here. It's the not-so-eligible bachelor.

1199
01:17:46,052 --> 01:17:50,295
-Aren't you getting married tomorrow?
-It's my bachelor party.
-Want me to jump out of a cake?

1200
01:17:50,599 --> 01:17:51,509
You can do that?

1201
01:17:51,933 --> 01:17:52,968
Nice.

1202
01:17:53,518 --> 01:17:56,180
No I just lost my friends here so I'm trying to find
them.

1203
01:17:56,563 --> 01:17:58,804
Ah. But you used that excuse already.

1204
01:17:59,566 --> 01:18:00,396
You know what I think?

1205
01:18:01,151 --> 01:18:04,188
I think you need to dance with me. It IS your
bachelor party after all.

1206
01:18:06,281 --> 01:18:09,068
Ok. ONE dance.

1207
01:18:14,331 --> 01:18:15,320
Sorry guys, I got pushed.

1208
01:18:16,374 --> 01:18:17,580
Our pleasure.

1209
01:18:18,668 --> 01:18:23,253
You better hold onto me kid. If I go down we're
both in trouble.
-Promises, promises.

1210
01:18:45,570 --> 01:18:48,107
I'll be right back I'm going to go say hi to Kurt.

1211
01:18:54,663 --> 01:18:55,527
Hey can I get a cup of ice?

1212
01:18:55,872 --> 01:18:56,827
You want a cup of ice?

1213
01:18:57,249 --> 01:18:59,080
Yeah.

1214
01:19:01,336 --> 01:19:01,825
Ok. Whatever.

1215
01:19:21,606 --> 01:19:22,095
Woof!

1216
01:19:31,283 --> 01:19:34,150
Wait. This was our song.

1217
01:19:34,703 --> 01:19:36,113
I know.

1218
01:19:38,748 --> 01:19:39,487
Nate.

1219
01:19:40,166 --> 01:19:43,283
Roger, It's your bachelor party.

1220
01:19:43,920 --> 01:19:45,205
Loosen up.

1221
01:19:47,424 --> 01:19:49,255
And get in the foam.

1222
01:19:56,141 --> 01:19:58,553
Simon. Have you seen Tyler?

1223
01:19:58,977 --> 01:20:00,558
I just saw Brent.
-what?

1224
01:20:00,854 --> 01:20:01,764
I just saw Brent.
-I can't hear-take the thing off.

1225
01:20:02,439 --> 01:20:04,225
-Brent, I just saw Brent.
-Really? Where?

1226
01:20:05,025 --> 01:20:06,640
C'mon, we have to go through the bear soup.

1227
01:20:08,737 --> 01:20:10,477
I'm sorry.

1228
01:20:11,364 --> 01:20:12,945
Oh my babies!

1229
01:20:16,411 --> 01:20:20,120
Hi! I missed you.-
-I missed you. How was the Dune tour?

1230
01:20:20,624 --> 01:20:22,615
Awesome. How was the spa?

1231
01:20:22,959 --> 01:20:24,199
It was enlightening.

1232
01:20:30,050 --> 01:20:31,961
I love you so much.

1233
01:20:32,802 --> 01:20:34,463
Wow. You should go to the spa more often.

1234
01:20:38,391 --> 01:20:39,847
Oh my god, what happened to your back?

1235
01:20:40,769 --> 01:20:43,385
Oh, I'll let Simon explain that one.

1236
01:20:45,523 --> 01:20:50,062
-Hey! I'm Mel.
-I'm Fred
-Uh, Ernie. Ber-Bernie.

1237
01:20:51,321 --> 01:20:52,777
Cute. Cute, cute.

1238
01:20:53,657 --> 01:20:54,988
You guys are hot. Do you guys play?

1239
01:20:57,535 --> 01:21:00,402
No we don't play.
-No?

1240
01:21:02,290 --> 01:21:04,155
It's too bad, because you guys are cute.

1241
01:21:06,836 --> 01:21:09,452
Are you all right?

1242
01:21:30,610 --> 01:21:33,317
Hey! Wait a minute.

1243
01:21:39,452 --> 01:21:44,412
You pissed on me!

1244
01:21:57,470 --> 01:21:59,335
What do you think you are doing?
-Hey baby, I'm dancing!
-You gotta relax, dude.

1245
01:21:59,764 --> 01:22:02,096
-Don't use that tone of voice with me.

1246
01:22:03,768 --> 01:22:08,637
Who the Fuck are you?
-I am his lover, that's who I am.

1247
01:22:09,065 --> 01:22:09,975
Doesn't look like that from here.
-I beg your pardon.

1248
01:22:10,483 --> 01:22:11,393
Hey, you better back the fuck up.

1249
01:22:11,943 --> 01:22:12,853
Or what bitch?

1250
01:22:13,570 --> 01:22:14,685
Slow down.

1251
01:22:18,408 --> 01:22:19,739
You don't need to do this, please.

1252
01:22:28,001 --> 01:22:31,334
Security, we need security on the dance floor now.

1253
01:22:33,965 --> 01:22:35,171
Just get off of me.

1254
01:22:39,304 --> 01:22:40,259
Break it up. Everybody out.

1255
01:22:41,056 --> 01:22:42,136
Get your own fuckin' man.

1256
01:22:42,474 --> 01:22:43,680
You need to put a leash on that bitch.

1257
01:22:46,770 --> 01:22:48,681
Stop.

1258
01:22:54,611 --> 01:23:00,481
I saw all those fat guys around, and you're on Scruff
everyday.

1259
01:23:02,660 --> 01:23:04,275
Get out. That's Bullshit.

1260
01:23:04,871 --> 01:23:07,954
We're opening a bar and the internet is good for
promoting!

1261
01:23:08,583 --> 01:23:10,039
Why didn't you tell me that, when I asked you
before?

1262
01:23:10,627 --> 01:23:13,084
I don't know, because I thought you trusted me.

1263
01:23:13,588 --> 01:23:16,079
I am so stupid.

1264
01:23:17,217 --> 01:23:18,707
It was kind of hot watching you fight for me,
though.

1265
01:23:20,053 --> 01:23:22,294
Only one problem.
-Your knee?

1266
01:23:23,723 --> 01:23:25,384
Ahhh. You can't take me anywhere.

1267
01:23:32,273 --> 01:23:36,357
Maybe I shouldn't have thrown that guy. Might
have been a bad idea.

1268
01:23:39,572 --> 01:23:42,279
Oh. Baby. Beautiful hat. I love that.

1269
01:23:42,575 --> 01:23:49,367
-Just in time for Easter. I feel like Loretta Divine.
-You look like Loretta Divine.

1270
01:23:51,835 --> 01:23:52,824
Where's Tyler?

1271
01:23:53,878 --> 01:23:54,867
I dunno, but we got to go.

1272
01:23:55,880 --> 01:23:56,790
Bears. Are. Crazy.

1273
01:23:57,924 --> 01:23:59,334
That's right!
-I'm sorry!

1274
01:24:01,845 --> 01:24:03,210
You're a slippery fellow, I like that.

1275
01:24:04,681 --> 01:24:07,047
I'm, I'm in hell!

1276
01:24:08,518 --> 01:24:10,759
Oh, all right guys.

1277
01:24:11,104 --> 01:24:13,641
Everybody's pushing me.

1278
01:24:15,692 --> 01:24:18,900
Thank you. I'm so sorry!

1279
01:24:27,996 --> 01:24:28,655
Fred?

1280
01:24:30,165 --> 01:24:31,871
Just pizza!

1281
01:24:33,334 --> 01:24:34,449
Fred?

1282
01:24:35,253 --> 01:24:35,912
All right.

1283
01:24:37,005 --> 01:24:38,870
Fred? Have you guys seen Fred?

1284
01:24:39,340 --> 01:24:40,876
Heavyset. Beard. No?

1285
01:24:46,222 --> 01:24:49,589
-I don't know what you want me to say.
-I don't know that you need to say anything.

1286
01:24:50,476 --> 01:24:52,558
Roger, what does that mean?

1287
01:24:53,563 --> 01:24:56,930
It's just our bachelor party, it's not like we caught
each other in bed with someone.

1288
01:24:58,860 --> 01:25:01,476
You still have feelings for him?

1289
01:25:02,572 --> 01:25:05,029
I have feelings for you. Hey!

1290
01:25:07,035 --> 01:25:09,151
I'm marrying you.

1291
01:25:11,372 --> 01:25:18,335
Nate's just my first love. You never forget your first
love.

1292
01:25:19,714 --> 01:25:22,581
And you're my first love. Does that mean I'll never
forget you?

1293
01:25:24,302 --> 01:25:26,509
I hope not.

1294
01:25:27,222 --> 01:25:31,010
I hope I'm your last love.

1295
01:25:41,986 --> 01:25:44,193
I'm sorry.

1296
01:25:49,077 --> 01:25:51,068
I just don't know what I'm thinking.

1297
01:25:51,454 --> 01:25:56,494
It's Ok. I know you go for bigger guys too. It's just
fulfilling a fantasy.

1298
01:26:00,129 --> 01:26:05,669
The reality is the commitment we get to make
tomorrow. Right?

1299
01:26:06,219 --> 01:26:09,211
Do you have feelings for this guy we need to talk
about?
-No

1300
01:26:12,308 --> 01:26:15,266
You are right.

1301
01:26:19,524 --> 01:26:21,856
Like you said, it's just a fantasy.

1302
01:26:23,194 --> 01:26:24,058
Ok.

1303
01:26:25,321 --> 01:26:27,482
[sexual sounds: mmphm, panting, groaning.]

1304
01:26:27,949 --> 01:26:31,908
Well, this must be the infamous Dick Dock.

1305
01:26:32,412 --> 01:26:36,121
I don't know what you're talking about.

1306
01:26:46,426 --> 01:26:50,715
Well, that didn't take long.

1307
01:26:52,932 --> 01:26:53,887
I can't believe it.

1308
01:26:54,225 --> 01:26:57,137
Oh, the gays!

1309
01:26:59,856 --> 01:27:02,222
Babe...

1310
01:27:05,611 --> 01:27:08,648
About tomorrow,

1311
01:27:09,991 --> 01:27:13,108
-If you need more time.
-No.

1312
01:27:14,954 --> 01:27:16,990
I don't need more time.

1313
01:27:18,791 --> 01:27:20,452
I love you.

1314
01:27:23,212 --> 01:27:25,669
And that makes me so happy.

1315
01:27:35,683 --> 01:27:38,345
Ty.
-Yeah.

1316
01:27:38,811 --> 01:27:40,972
Hey. Dad!

1317
01:27:41,898 --> 01:27:45,140
What are you doing out here?

1318
01:27:46,194 --> 01:27:49,982
I was just taking a walk along the beach. Isn't it
beautiful?

1319
01:27:50,782 --> 01:27:52,522
Yes...

1320
01:27:52,825 --> 01:27:53,735
[Slaps and sexual sounds]

1321
01:27:55,161 --> 01:27:58,653
-What's going on over there?
-Nothing!

1322
01:27:59,332 --> 01:28:02,790
Oh. Oh my.

1323
01:28:04,212 --> 01:28:07,625
Well. Uh.

1324
01:28:08,758 --> 01:28:11,591
I'll see you guys tomorrow.

1325
01:28:12,512 --> 01:28:13,752
Sorry to bother you.

1326
01:28:14,263 --> 01:28:18,723
Goodnight Dad.

1327
01:28:59,559 --> 01:29:00,639
Hi Mom.

1328
01:29:01,686 --> 01:29:03,426
Hi. Good morning.

1329
01:29:04,772 --> 01:29:07,639
-You Ok?
-I'm fine, honey. What's up?

1330
01:29:09,652 --> 01:29:12,268
Can I talk to you?

1331
01:29:13,531 --> 01:29:16,273
Sure, Fred. What is it?

1332
01:29:34,594 --> 01:29:40,430
I'm so sorry!
-I'm sorry man... bro.

1333
01:29:46,230 --> 01:29:51,645
I'M SORRY!

1334
01:29:54,197 --> 01:29:56,062
Yeah! YEAH! Your gonna be sorry!

1335
01:29:59,368 --> 01:30:02,326
He's louder than my husband.

1336
01:30:05,458 --> 01:30:07,995
Who wants breakfast? Last call people.

1337
01:30:09,754 --> 01:30:14,123
Tyler. Tyler wake up. We're going to be late.

1338
01:30:22,683 --> 01:30:25,220
Gabe, come up! Eggs. Sunny side, just like you like
them.

1339
01:30:35,655 --> 01:30:38,146
(singing) Happy days are here...

1340
01:30:49,252 --> 01:30:52,415
Eggs getting cold!

1341
01:31:00,263 --> 01:31:04,051
-That's what I'm talking about.
-Really?

1342
01:31:10,231 --> 01:31:13,644
(imitating a TV commercial) Stuck in the stairs again?
Call Life Alert. I've fallen and I can't get up!

1343
01:31:14,485 --> 01:31:17,192
Can I get in there first?

1344
01:31:22,201 --> 01:31:23,407
Ok, the eggs are now chickens.

1345
01:31:32,336 --> 01:31:33,166
Hey, you look stunning.

1346
01:31:33,504 --> 01:31:34,664
Thanks, sweetheart.

1347
01:31:35,089 --> 01:31:37,330
-Let's go!
-Coming! Just have to get dressed!

1348
01:31:41,554 --> 01:31:46,139
-Sit, sit.
-Can I put my belt on first?
-Put your belt on, I'm sorry.

1349
01:31:47,226 --> 01:31:50,218
-I wanted to talk to you before the wedding.
-Talk fast.

1350
01:31:52,064 --> 01:31:56,307
I was thinking. Given the fact that there's a-

1351
01:31:56,902 --> 01:32:00,440
-Hurry up, bitches. We are waiting on you two.
-Thank you! You ready?

1352
01:32:03,367 --> 01:32:05,449
Yeah. Let's go.

1353
01:32:37,318 --> 01:32:39,650
We are gathered here today to witness the union of

1354
01:32:39,987 --> 01:32:43,275
Roger Dennis Beam and Tyler Stephen Hall.

1355
01:32:43,616 --> 01:32:46,824
A marriage is more than just the freedom to say I
do.

1356
01:32:47,161 --> 01:32:48,776
When two people commit to each other in
marriage,

1357
01:32:49,288 --> 01:32:54,999
they look into each other's hearts and say, I give all
that I am and all that I will become

1358
01:32:55,336 --> 01:32:59,796
to you. Roger and Tyler have said, Our bond has
proven itself strong enough to make that
commitment and we are so glad-

1359
01:33:02,218 --> 01:33:03,298
Wait.

1360
01:33:04,637 --> 01:33:05,797
Stop.

1361
01:33:10,434 --> 01:33:11,389
What's wrong?

1362
01:33:13,479 --> 01:33:15,470
Tyler, I love you with all my heart.

1363
01:33:16,982 --> 01:33:18,347
I love you too.

1364
01:33:18,776 --> 01:33:20,607
I know you do.

1365
01:33:22,822 --> 01:33:25,359
And that's why I can't go through with this.

1366
01:33:27,201 --> 01:33:29,066
What?

1367
01:33:31,706 --> 01:33:33,742
This isn't right.

1368
01:33:36,919 --> 01:33:41,458
-Baby, what about last night?
-Your dad at the Dick Dock?

1369
01:33:42,675 --> 01:33:45,963
-What did he say?
-Nothing. Nothing.
-(Hat Sister giggles)

1370
01:33:47,930 --> 01:33:51,673
See, that is the first time you have smiled all
morning.

1371
01:33:54,520 --> 01:33:58,263
I feel like... I don't know. Like I'm pushing you,

1372
01:33:58,607 --> 01:34:01,895
and myself, for that matter, into this just because it's
legal.

1373
01:34:02,945 --> 01:34:07,609
If I am wrong, then I will shut up and marry you, and
be as honorable as I know how to be.

1374
01:34:10,202 --> 01:34:16,869
But if I am right, we owe it to ourselves to allow our
relationship to

1375
01:34:17,209 --> 01:34:20,952
evolve as it's supposed and not be dictated by
marriage.

1376
01:34:28,220 --> 01:34:30,381
You're right.

1377
01:34:32,308 --> 01:34:33,798
I'm sorry.

1378
01:34:35,436 --> 01:34:42,979
I just felt like marriage was everything to everyone.

1379
01:34:43,402 --> 01:34:47,441
So I owed it to everyone to go through with it.

1380
01:34:50,367 --> 01:34:52,824
And maybe one day you will.

1381
01:34:54,663 --> 01:34:56,494
But I don't think today is that day.

1382
01:34:59,668 --> 01:35:01,954
It's not.

1383
01:35:03,506 --> 01:35:05,747
It's not, I'm sorry.

1384
01:35:06,467 --> 01:35:09,254
I love you.

1385
01:35:10,721 --> 01:35:21,347
I love you. And I want you to be free to become the
amazing man I know you're going to be.

1386
01:35:27,404 --> 01:35:29,895
This is the craziest wedding I've ever seen.

1387
01:35:30,241 --> 01:35:32,152
Ok, was that the vows?

1388
01:35:34,620 --> 01:35:37,202
Folks, I'm sorry but I don't think there's going to be
a wedding today.

1389
01:35:44,672 --> 01:35:45,536
Wait!

1390
01:35:46,674 --> 01:35:48,539
Yes there is.

1391
01:35:48,884 --> 01:35:51,170
Oh Fuck no. Fred?! Are you insane?!

1392
01:35:51,637 --> 01:35:55,630
It's not exactly the response I was hoping for.

1393
01:35:56,016 --> 01:35:58,348
This is a second hand wedding!

1394
01:36:07,736 --> 01:36:09,601
This is my father's ring.

1395
01:36:11,073 --> 01:36:13,109
Yes.

1396
01:36:14,285 --> 01:36:18,278
Where did you get it from?

1397
01:36:30,676 --> 01:36:33,088
Is this what you really want?

1398
01:36:35,472 --> 01:36:38,134
More than I can say.

1399
01:36:38,726 --> 01:36:44,346
-Ok.
-Yes?
-Yes!

1400
01:36:53,490 --> 01:36:58,905
Everybody, I'm getting married!

1401
01:37:05,544 --> 01:37:09,708
Ok. We are gathered here today to witness the
union of Fred and Brent.

1402
01:37:28,692 --> 01:37:32,059
I do.

1403
01:37:32,821 --> 01:37:36,905
I do.

1404
01:38:22,413 --> 01:38:23,528
Hey, how are you doing?

1405
01:38:25,374 --> 01:38:26,989
Go in guys... Have fun.

1406
01:38:28,919 --> 01:38:31,706
That's on us.

1407
01:38:33,132 --> 01:38:37,842
Holy shit! Brian Kent is in the house. The usual?

1408
01:38:39,430 --> 01:38:43,423
What was he thinking with those boots
-Who ordered the ShirleyTemple?

1409
01:39:05,998 --> 01:39:08,410
Hey can I get an order of pepperoni pizza for the
VIP, please?

1410
01:39:08,792 --> 01:39:09,656
You got it, boss.

1411
01:39:10,544 --> 01:39:10,782
Gimme a beer?

1412
01:39:11,462 --> 01:39:12,702
Gimme?, Miss Manners? Really?

1413
01:39:15,424 --> 01:39:15,913
Roger.

1414
01:39:17,760 --> 01:39:23,096
Do me a favor? That guy back there is Dan Choi, can
you hook him up with these 4 beers?

1415
01:39:25,059 --> 01:39:26,845
Carlos, I got to tell you this looks great.

1416
01:39:27,186 --> 01:39:30,098
Good crowd, pool table, mouthy bartender.

1417
01:39:30,689 --> 01:39:31,348
I heard that.

1418
01:39:32,357 --> 01:39:36,521
And I am telling you, you guys are going to be so
happy with the numbers.

1419
01:39:37,196 --> 01:39:41,064
We're just happy you turned your passion into
something fun and fantastic for everyone.

1420
01:39:42,076 --> 01:39:44,818
Speak for yourself, I didn't invest in this place to get
laid.

1421
01:39:46,205 --> 01:39:47,741
Did I just say that?
-Who took Roger?

1422
01:39:52,044 --> 01:39:53,784
Oh, the boys are here.

1423
01:39:54,296 --> 01:39:55,911
Ready for your opening night?

1424
01:39:56,924 --> 01:39:57,788
Are they ever.

1425
01:39:58,133 --> 01:39:59,714
I cannot wait to see it.

1426
01:40:02,179 --> 01:40:07,139
Tyler, I thought you had a date tonight, not that we
mind Simon The Twink coming with you.

1427
01:40:07,684 --> 01:40:08,799
Shut your face, Grandpa!

1428
01:40:11,063 --> 01:40:13,600
Oh, Ty. He's cute.

1429
01:40:14,024 --> 01:40:15,514
Yeah, I like him.

1430
01:40:22,950 --> 01:40:24,861
Excuse me guys, I'll be right back.

1431
01:40:25,202 --> 01:40:27,693
Carlos, this place looks so great.

1432
01:40:29,414 --> 01:40:30,824
Hey, handsome.

1433
01:40:32,084 --> 01:40:37,044
-Thanks for coming.
-Thanks for inviting me. This is exciting, who owns
this place anyhow?

1434
01:40:37,714 --> 01:40:40,672
Carlos, over there in the black.

1435
01:40:41,552 --> 01:40:44,794
-Carlos this place is wepa!
-WEPA!

1436
01:40:46,682 --> 01:40:51,551
Thank you guys so much. And I heard you got your
camera back, in the editing room, raring to go.

1437
01:40:51,937 --> 01:40:55,020
We decided we didn't need Scott O anymore and
we're doing it the old fashioned way.

1438
01:40:55,691 --> 01:40:58,057
We're maxing-out our credit cards.
-That's the way to do it.

1439
01:40:59,153 --> 01:41:01,269
What about you? Are you happy now, Mr. Producer?

1440
01:41:01,864 --> 01:41:03,400
No more nasty bitchy cub?

1441
01:41:03,907 --> 01:41:08,867
No, this is something we found to do together. And
the world needs another bear documentary!

1442
01:41:09,705 --> 01:41:11,821
Just kidding, it's going to be amazing!

1443
01:41:12,875 --> 01:41:14,115
Oh! You made it.

1444
01:41:14,585 --> 01:41:15,620
I wouldn't have missed it.

1445
01:41:18,505 --> 01:41:19,870
Congratulations Carlos.

1446
01:41:20,215 --> 01:41:21,705
Thank you, bro.

1447
01:41:23,051 --> 01:41:25,007
Nate, are you glad to be back in town finally?

1448
01:41:25,512 --> 01:41:28,094
Well, P-town has its charms. No doubt.

1449
01:41:28,432 --> 01:41:30,297
But, NewYork...

1450
01:41:32,269 --> 01:41:34,931
NewYork is where my heart is.

1451
01:41:45,741 --> 01:41:48,027
So, I assume that's the ex over there?

1452
01:41:49,077 --> 01:41:51,489
Yeah, that's Roger.

1453
01:41:52,372 --> 01:41:56,786
Can I also assume that y'all are just friends now?

1454
01:41:57,628 --> 01:41:59,584
You never forget your first love, but yeah

1455
01:42:00,464 --> 01:42:06,050
whatever we had, just kind of naturally evolved into
a great friendship.

1456
01:42:06,803 --> 01:42:08,759
That's very honorable.

1457
01:42:09,640 --> 01:42:12,382
Coming from a fireman that's quite a compliment.

1458
01:42:12,809 --> 01:42:14,970
Fire Chief, thank you.

1459
01:42:15,604 --> 01:42:18,892
-There's a million lewd things I could say.
-I'm sure I've heard all of them too

1460
01:42:19,650 --> 01:42:21,186
But for now.

1461
01:42:21,902 --> 01:42:24,564
Why do we have to say anything?

1462
01:42:28,325 --> 01:42:30,941
Hey guys. Pizza is up, you want it cut or what?

1463
01:42:32,663 --> 01:42:34,278
Give us a second?

1464
01:42:47,469 --> 01:42:51,963
I would like to propose another toast.

1465
01:42:52,432 --> 01:42:56,971
This time to our newly married couple!

1466
01:42:57,354 --> 01:43:01,814
Mr. Brent and Fred Richards-Dean

1467
01:43:05,988 --> 01:43:07,944
Woooheee!

1468
01:43:08,323 --> 01:43:09,358
Congratulations!

1469
01:43:15,247 --> 01:43:16,612
Cheers.

1470
01:43:18,834 --> 01:43:19,994
I love you, Gobo.

1471
01:43:20,669 --> 01:43:24,002
I love you, husband.
