1
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,916
Hey, get outta the car, kid.

2
00:01:44,793 --> 00:01:46,541
Get outta the car.

3
00:01:47,752 --> 00:01:50,334
Hey, kid. Get outta the car.
Come on.

4
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:53,916
Hey, moron.

5
00:01:53,999 --> 00:01:55,751
Get him outta the car,
would you?

6
00:02:01,502 --> 00:02:03,918
Come on, dude.
Get outta the car.

7
00:02:04,753 --> 00:02:06,376
Come on.
Open it.

8
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:08,792
Come on. Get outta the car.

9
00:02:09,294 --> 00:02:11,250
Get outta the fucking car.

10
00:02:11,251 --> 00:02:12,792
Ow! Fuck!

11
00:02:12,793 --> 00:02:14,709
Put down the fucking window!
I'm serious!

12
00:02:30,504 --> 00:02:32,420
Why'd you have to sell the car?

13
00:02:34,585 --> 00:02:36,711
It couldn't stay out in front
of the house forever, T.J.

14
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,169
Why not?

15
00:02:41,544 --> 00:02:42,627
It's not healthy.

16
00:02:42,711 --> 00:02:44,377
Neither are these.

17
00:02:49,212 --> 00:02:50,878
I don't wanna talk about it anymore.

18
00:03:07,505 --> 00:03:08,503
Oh.

19
00:03:08,588 --> 00:03:09,920
Oh, hey.

20
00:03:10,672 --> 00:03:11,711
Mmm.

21
00:03:14,005 --> 00:03:15,630
Morning.

22
00:03:17,504 --> 00:03:19,922
Can I have some money
so I can buy lunch today?

23
00:03:21,838 --> 00:03:23,003
Oh...

24
00:03:25,048 --> 00:03:27,004
Yeah. Sorry.

25
00:03:33,965 --> 00:03:35,214
Thanks.

26
00:03:35,589 --> 00:03:37,381
Have a nice day, Teej.

27
00:04:40,549 --> 00:04:41,968
Come on. Get up.

28
00:04:46,927 --> 00:04:48,550
Please.

29
00:04:54,593 --> 00:04:55,759
You just fucked me.

30
00:05:03,219 --> 00:05:04,467
Who's in there?

31
00:05:10,218 --> 00:05:11,635
Motherfuck!

32
00:05:22,386 --> 00:05:23,511
Hey!

33
00:06:00,514 --> 00:06:02,054
Cole.

34
00:06:02,389 --> 00:06:03,721
Dimino.

35
00:06:03,847 --> 00:06:05,055
Hooper.

36
00:06:05,805 --> 00:06:07,055
Fullwood.

37
00:06:07,764 --> 00:06:09,053
Edgerdon.

38
00:06:09,804 --> 00:06:11,053
Fletcher.

39
00:06:11,888 --> 00:06:13,682
Forney. T.J. Forney's back?

40
00:06:14,682 --> 00:06:16,346
Welcome back, T.J.

41
00:06:17,221 --> 00:06:18,388
Roger.

42
00:06:19,056 --> 00:06:20,263
Sumner.

43
00:06:21,013 --> 00:06:22,055
Sarasota...

44
00:06:42,849 --> 00:06:46,432
What's up now, punk?
You don't look so tough, now, do you?

45
00:06:46,766 --> 00:06:49,223
- Leave me alone.
- How about you suck my cock?

46
00:06:50,058 --> 00:06:51,557
Suck my cock.

47
00:06:51,932 --> 00:06:53,808
Fucking suck my cock.

48
00:07:27,226 --> 00:07:28,600
Hi, pumpkin.

49
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:30,724
- Hi.
- How was your day?

50
00:07:32,061 --> 00:07:33,893
It pretty much sucked.

51
00:07:34,018 --> 00:07:35,476
Why, sweetheart?

52
00:07:36,309 --> 00:07:37,642
I don't know. Just did.

53
00:07:40,851 --> 00:07:42,144
You want me to turn on the light for you?

54
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,059
Why, do I look like I'm sitting
in the dark here?

55
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:49,976
I don't know. Maybe a little.

56
00:07:51,061 --> 00:07:53,062
Maybe I need new glasses.

57
00:07:55,352 --> 00:07:57,977
Actually, I don't even know
if these are mine.

58
00:07:58,061 --> 00:07:59,603
Whose are they?

59
00:08:00,103 --> 00:08:01,851
Geez, I don't know.

60
00:08:04,644 --> 00:08:06,309
Well, can you see better with them?

61
00:08:08,728 --> 00:08:11,020
Just... I don't know.

62
00:08:14,895 --> 00:08:16,644
Is your dad up yet?

63
00:08:18,062 --> 00:08:20,268
Why, has he been sleeping all day?

64
00:08:20,853 --> 00:08:22,061
Mmm-hmm.

65
00:08:22,813 --> 00:08:25,642
You know, sometimes people
get thrown off balance

66
00:08:25,728 --> 00:08:27,312
when bad things happen.

67
00:08:27,396 --> 00:08:29,894
But they come good again, in the end.

68
00:08:45,689 --> 00:08:47,561
Milk to wet your whistle?

69
00:08:47,647 --> 00:08:48,730
Yeah.

70
00:09:01,731 --> 00:09:02,856
Okay.

71
00:09:04,147 --> 00:09:05,896
How does that feel?

72
00:09:06,439 --> 00:09:09,230
Here. You want to turn
your wrist for me a little bit, like this.

73
00:09:09,313 --> 00:09:11,065
And now, like this.

74
00:09:11,691 --> 00:09:12,815
Good.

75
00:09:12,898 --> 00:09:16,814
If we consider that dreams
serve a metaphoric function

76
00:09:16,899 --> 00:09:19,563
in narrative fiction, as they do in life,

77
00:09:19,648 --> 00:09:23,354
what metaphoric function
are these dreams serving

78
00:09:23,773 --> 00:09:24,814
for our protagonist?

79
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:28,439
Are they premonitions, or are they desires?

80
00:09:29,273 --> 00:09:30,357
Are they nightmares, even?

81
00:09:31,775 --> 00:09:34,107
Given what we know about Maurice,

82
00:09:34,191 --> 00:09:37,106
where he's from,
what his childhood was like...

83
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:39,607
I think it's a safe assumption to assume

84
00:09:39,691 --> 00:09:42,690
the dreams he's having are a reflection

85
00:09:42,773 --> 00:09:44,856
upon his relationship to his mother.

86
00:09:45,984 --> 00:09:47,857
T.J.! What are you doing?

87
00:09:49,316 --> 00:09:50,815
Bring that here.

88
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:00,482
Hey, fuckface!

89
00:10:00,733 --> 00:10:02,607
You think this is funny?

90
00:10:02,817 --> 00:10:04,108
Fuckface!

91
00:10:04,525 --> 00:10:06,108
You think this is funny?

92
00:10:06,359 --> 00:10:08,607
I'm going to fucking rip your head off!

93
00:10:41,153 --> 00:10:43,067
I'm going to fucking kill you!

94
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:45,609
You think you can draw
on my fucking car?

95
00:10:45,696 --> 00:10:46,652
- Hey!
- Huh?

96
00:10:46,736 --> 00:10:48,193
- Get off him!
- Get the fuck up, bitch!

97
00:10:48,278 --> 00:10:49,526
Stop it!

98
00:10:49,654 --> 00:10:50,985
Get the fuck up, bitch!

99
00:10:51,071 --> 00:10:52,819
- I said stop it!
- Get the fuck up!

100
00:10:54,276 --> 00:10:56,487
What the fuck are you doing, lady?

101
00:10:56,570 --> 00:10:58,318
What are you doing?

102
00:10:59,445 --> 00:11:00,527
Hey!

103
00:11:00,738 --> 00:11:02,568
Hey. Hey.

104
00:11:03,611 --> 00:11:05,403
We're not finished,
you little piece of shit.

105
00:11:17,278 --> 00:11:18,612
You okay?

106
00:11:20,197 --> 00:11:21,445
Am I bleeding?

107
00:11:22,695 --> 00:11:24,319
I don't think so.

108
00:11:25,405 --> 00:11:26,488
Am I?

109
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:33,736
Oh.

110
00:11:34,072 --> 00:11:35,486
Need a ride?

111
00:11:35,904 --> 00:11:38,113
Come on. Come on.

112
00:11:48,071 --> 00:11:49,989
I can't believe he called me lady.

113
00:11:50,072 --> 00:11:52,238
Do I look like a lady to you?

114
00:11:55,615 --> 00:11:56,863
I guess.

115
00:12:03,614 --> 00:12:04,823
Thanks.

116
00:12:05,613 --> 00:12:07,656
I was asking if I look old.

117
00:12:12,365 --> 00:12:13,447
So...

118
00:12:14,073 --> 00:12:16,491
Guess I'm kind of a hero now, huh?

119
00:12:20,242 --> 00:12:22,905
Well, actually, I basically just
didn't wanna have to go home...

120
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:26,158
and then feel bad the rest of the day
for not helping you,

121
00:12:26,409 --> 00:12:29,573
then hear about you on the news
getting beat to death in the parking lot.

122
00:12:30,157 --> 00:12:33,156
So I really just did it for myself
'cause I'm selfish.

123
00:12:35,117 --> 00:12:36,281
Sorry.

124
00:12:38,408 --> 00:12:40,201
Sorry I'm like that.

125
00:12:52,533 --> 00:12:53,741
Okay.

126
00:13:02,369 --> 00:13:03,575
See you.

127
00:13:15,618 --> 00:13:17,033
Hey!

128
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:19,034
You want your bike?

129
00:13:20,368 --> 00:13:21,450
Shit.

130
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:39,389
Nice meeting you.

131
00:13:45,786 --> 00:13:47,203
Dad?

132
00:13:53,558 --> 00:13:54,496
Dad?

133
00:13:58,143 --> 00:13:59,185
Dad?

134
00:14:01,037 --> 00:14:02,326
Grandma, where's Dad?

135
00:14:02,413 --> 00:14:03,826
Oh, hi, T.J.

136
00:14:03,954 --> 00:14:05,828
He's gone to the doctor, honey.

137
00:14:05,912 --> 00:14:06,995
Everything okay?

138
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,495
Yeah, okay.

139
00:14:19,164 --> 00:14:21,162
Where's the laundry room?

140
00:14:21,913 --> 00:14:22,996
My dad's going to be home soon...

141
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:25,080
Where's the laundry room?

142
00:14:25,289 --> 00:14:26,372
Why?

143
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:29,662
Ever been skull-fucked?

144
00:14:30,746 --> 00:14:31,746
No.

145
00:14:31,955 --> 00:14:33,746
Would you like to be?

146
00:14:34,746 --> 00:14:36,539
It's through there.

147
00:14:36,664 --> 00:14:38,706
But why? You can't.

148
00:14:57,373 --> 00:15:02,581
What are you doing?

149
00:15:04,082 --> 00:15:05,498
Why are you here?

150
00:15:11,082 --> 00:15:14,165
You're going to start acting
like I belong here,

151
00:15:14,249 --> 00:15:15,874
or I'll kill you.

152
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:18,748
I'll kill your family.

153
00:15:52,961 --> 00:15:54,127
You can't smoke in here.

154
00:15:58,834 --> 00:16:01,750
What are you doing? You can't smoke in here.

155
00:16:04,128 --> 00:16:05,668
Will you please just put it out?

156
00:16:07,295 --> 00:16:08,917
How about I put it out in your mouth?

157
00:16:21,919 --> 00:16:23,503
T.J., who is this?

158
00:16:24,378 --> 00:16:25,671
My name's Hesher.

159
00:16:25,754 --> 00:16:27,878
I'm a friend of your son's.

160
00:16:30,584 --> 00:16:31,919
What is he doing here?

161
00:16:33,004 --> 00:16:35,253
He's... He's doing laundry.

162
00:16:37,629 --> 00:16:39,919
Can I talk to you for a second?

163
00:16:49,796 --> 00:16:51,004
Is he smoking in the house?

164
00:16:51,088 --> 00:16:52,421
Oh, well, I...

165
00:16:59,421 --> 00:17:00,503
He's a friend of yours?

166
00:17:00,587 --> 00:17:01,671
I told him he could sleep on the couch.

167
00:17:01,753 --> 00:17:04,420
You guys know you only got four channels?

168
00:17:16,757 --> 00:17:18,713
Hello, there, young man.

169
00:17:18,963 --> 00:17:20,087
Hey, old lady.

170
00:17:21,965 --> 00:17:23,171
Can I help you with something?

171
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:27,297
No, I'm good.

172
00:17:55,424 --> 00:17:56,756
Fuck!

173
00:17:57,465 --> 00:17:59,132
God damn it!

174
00:18:06,384 --> 00:18:08,174
Jesus fucking Christ.

175
00:18:39,468 --> 00:18:41,509
Now you got more channels.

176
00:19:03,427 --> 00:19:04,552
So, why are you here?

177
00:19:04,635 --> 00:19:05,760
What?

178
00:19:08,427 --> 00:19:09,594
That your room?

179
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,592
No, that's the garage.

180
00:19:22,594 --> 00:19:25,096
Would your friend like to eat
some dinner, dear?

181
00:19:25,761 --> 00:19:27,261
He's not hungry.

182
00:19:27,346 --> 00:19:28,593
You sure?

183
00:19:29,928 --> 00:19:31,428
Yeah, I'm sure.

184
00:19:32,053 --> 00:19:34,014
What's he doing in the garage?

185
00:19:34,097 --> 00:19:35,263
I don't know.

186
00:19:35,346 --> 00:19:37,928
I told him he could practice
his guitar in there.

187
00:19:38,014 --> 00:19:39,929
Oh, that's great, honey.

188
00:19:40,722 --> 00:19:44,095
So nice to have a bit of music
around the house again.

189
00:19:44,805 --> 00:19:46,511
Is he a new friend?

190
00:19:46,595 --> 00:19:48,678
Um, yeah. Sort of.

191
00:19:52,097 --> 00:19:56,179
You know, your grandfather
played the harmonica for many years.

192
00:20:30,764 --> 00:20:33,433
Oh, I'm sorry, honey. We're out of milk.

193
00:20:33,598 --> 00:20:36,389
I can cook you up some eggs
if you like, dear.

194
00:20:36,473 --> 00:20:37,514
No, thanks.

195
00:20:39,141 --> 00:20:40,556
Would you like to take a walk?

196
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,390
I can't, Grandma.
I got stuff I gotta do.

197
00:20:43,891 --> 00:20:46,639
No, I mean later. This afternoon.

198
00:20:46,725 --> 00:20:48,348
I don't know.

199
00:20:48,433 --> 00:20:49,932
Can you ask me when I get home?

200
00:20:50,351 --> 00:20:51,724
All righty.

201
00:21:31,226 --> 00:21:32,477
I want to get the car back.

202
00:21:33,686 --> 00:21:35,601
The car is not for sale.

203
00:21:35,810 --> 00:21:36,851
Well, I want to buy it back.

204
00:21:36,934 --> 00:21:37,977
So how much do you want for it?

205
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:41,308
Sit down.

206
00:21:44,893 --> 00:21:46,268
$1,800 for the car,

207
00:21:46,352 --> 00:21:48,101
not including taxes, registration,

208
00:21:48,186 --> 00:21:49,185
- ADM or dealer fees...
- Yeah, I can get that.

209
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:50,810
On top of that,

210
00:21:50,894 --> 00:21:52,351
you also need a valid driver's license.

211
00:21:52,437 --> 00:21:53,935
I'm sure you don't have one of those.

212
00:21:54,061 --> 00:21:56,518
- You need proof of insurance.
- But I can get...

213
00:21:56,602 --> 00:21:58,393
And I know you don't have that.

214
00:21:58,477 --> 00:22:00,601
And even if you did
have both of these things,

215
00:22:00,685 --> 00:22:01,685
I couldn't sell you the car

216
00:22:01,769 --> 00:22:05,102
because the damn thing's not for sale.
End of story.

217
00:22:05,184 --> 00:22:06,978
Now, if you'll let me get back to this.

218
00:22:50,732 --> 00:22:51,855
Hi.

219
00:22:52,439 --> 00:22:53,523
Hey.

220
00:22:54,273 --> 00:22:55,772
How's it going?

221
00:22:55,855 --> 00:22:57,979
Um, I got you an ice cream.

222
00:22:59,564 --> 00:23:01,606
That's so nice. Thank you.

223
00:23:04,606 --> 00:23:06,314
And I paid for it over there.

224
00:23:08,023 --> 00:23:09,357
Thank you.

225
00:23:16,647 --> 00:23:19,939
See you.

226
00:23:27,816 --> 00:23:29,105
And earlier that day,

227
00:23:29,191 --> 00:23:31,441
I had made a cherry cake.

228
00:23:31,941 --> 00:23:34,105
And I used...
I didn't know until afterwards,

229
00:23:34,189 --> 00:23:37,190
I used a new product. It was called Fluffo.

230
00:23:38,108 --> 00:23:40,023
I never made it again, that Fluffo.

231
00:23:40,107 --> 00:23:42,356
I served the cake, and then...

232
00:23:44,649 --> 00:23:47,691
It stuck to the roof of their mouth.

233
00:23:47,776 --> 00:23:48,858
Oh!

234
00:23:48,943 --> 00:23:50,190
They couldn't swallow it!

235
00:23:52,192 --> 00:23:54,107
Fucking Fluffo.

236
00:23:54,277 --> 00:23:55,899
Oh, hi, T.J.

237
00:23:57,607 --> 00:23:58,941
Hi, honey.

238
00:24:11,609 --> 00:24:14,940
So, who's going for a walk with me
tomorrow morning?

239
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:20,942
T.J.?

240
00:24:21,527 --> 00:24:24,110
I can't, Grandma.
I have to go to school tomorrow.

241
00:24:24,818 --> 00:24:26,774
Oh. Okay. Okay.

242
00:24:27,943 --> 00:24:29,861
You're always invited.

243
00:24:31,778 --> 00:24:32,817
So what?

244
00:24:37,153 --> 00:24:38,777
So what, school?

245
00:24:39,443 --> 00:24:40,859
Go on a walk with your grandma.

246
00:24:40,945 --> 00:24:42,528
He's right, T.J.

247
00:24:42,610 --> 00:24:43,818
I'd love the company.

248
00:24:43,902 --> 00:24:45,527
Fucking A, she would.

249
00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:48,194
Your grandma goes walking
in the morning by herself.

250
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:51,776
You can't get your ass
out of bed an hour earlier?

251
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:53,944
What if she gets raped?

252
00:24:55,527 --> 00:24:56,737
What?

253
00:24:56,819 --> 00:24:58,278
Ever heard of the Granny Killer?

254
00:24:58,695 --> 00:25:00,570
- The Granny Killer?
- Yeah, the Granny...

255
00:25:01,446 --> 00:25:03,694
The Granny Killer killed, like,
13 or 14 old ladies.

256
00:25:04,404 --> 00:25:06,029
Used to choke them
with their dirty panties and shit.

257
00:25:06,113 --> 00:25:07,360
I don't think he'd cock-fuck 'em all,

258
00:25:07,446 --> 00:25:09,611
- but he would finger-fuck 'em all.
- Okay. That's enough.

259
00:25:12,445 --> 00:25:14,652
I don't care. I'm just saying.

260
00:25:16,279 --> 00:25:19,404
Your grandma asked you to go for a walk.
You should go.

261
00:25:20,404 --> 00:25:22,361
So she doesn't get raped.

262
00:25:22,571 --> 00:25:24,569
Why would anyone rape me?

263
00:25:25,488 --> 00:25:27,030
Fucked if I know.

264
00:25:27,571 --> 00:25:29,030
People do it.

265
00:25:29,281 --> 00:25:31,197
There's some sick fucks out there.

266
00:26:27,742 --> 00:26:31,574
You fucked my car, you little prick.

267
00:26:32,116 --> 00:26:34,616
Get in there. Eat the cake!

268
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:36,116
Fucking eat the fucking cake!

269
00:26:38,617 --> 00:26:41,448
Get off me!

270
00:26:42,450 --> 00:26:43,782
Get off!

271
00:26:48,784 --> 00:26:50,326
Eat the cake, you bitch!

272
00:26:54,701 --> 00:26:55,742
Ready?

273
00:26:59,953 --> 00:27:01,074
I don't want to go.

274
00:27:02,451 --> 00:27:03,992
It will be good for us.

275
00:27:05,869 --> 00:27:08,492
Come on. Teej, we're going to be late.

276
00:27:14,453 --> 00:27:17,909
So, welcome everyone
to the transformational grief group.

277
00:27:18,411 --> 00:27:20,035
My name is Meryl.

278
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:23,702
We should start off by introducing ourselves

279
00:27:23,785 --> 00:27:26,618
and briefly explaining why we are here.

280
00:27:33,454 --> 00:27:35,286
Hi. Would you please start us off?

281
00:27:38,703 --> 00:27:41,493
We're the Bolder Family.

282
00:27:43,454 --> 00:27:46,785
I'm Colleen. This is my husband Jack.

283
00:27:47,662 --> 00:27:49,578
Our daughter Cynthia...

284
00:27:53,495 --> 00:27:55,869
Was murdered last year.

285
00:27:59,455 --> 00:28:01,078
She's the victim...

286
00:28:03,497 --> 00:28:07,703
of a violent attack
that was unfair and sick.

287
00:28:13,413 --> 00:28:15,664
We're here 'cause we need help.

288
00:28:17,123 --> 00:28:18,747
We lost our baby.

289
00:28:28,621 --> 00:28:30,371
Hi. My name is Jack.

290
00:28:33,123 --> 00:28:38,955
As my wife said, we're here hoping
for some answers, and...

291
00:28:41,457 --> 00:28:44,457
Just some help with the pain.

292
00:28:45,791 --> 00:28:47,122
Thank you.

293
00:28:49,290 --> 00:28:51,956
Colleen and Jack, welcome.

294
00:28:53,457 --> 00:28:54,538
Sir?

295
00:28:57,166 --> 00:28:58,374
Mmm-hmm.

296
00:29:01,081 --> 00:29:02,164
Um...

297
00:29:03,082 --> 00:29:04,749
Sure, okay. Uh...

298
00:29:07,791 --> 00:29:10,039
My name is Paul Forney,

299
00:29:10,373 --> 00:29:13,165
and this is my son T.J.

300
00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:19,915
And we're here because I lost my wife,

301
00:29:20,916 --> 00:29:22,290
T.J.'s mom,

302
00:29:23,751 --> 00:29:26,000
a bit more than two months ago.

303
00:29:30,417 --> 00:29:31,875
We're just

304
00:29:32,877 --> 00:29:35,043
trying to come to terms with things.

305
00:29:36,958 --> 00:29:40,167
And looking

306
00:29:42,585 --> 00:29:44,250
for guidance around...

307
00:29:50,335 --> 00:29:54,666
...things. So, yeah.

308
00:30:02,084 --> 00:30:04,544
Okay. Welcome, Paul.

309
00:30:08,002 --> 00:30:09,251
Hi, T.J.

310
00:30:12,128 --> 00:30:14,918
I understand how hard it is to lose a mom.

311
00:30:17,586 --> 00:30:20,003
Would you like to introduce yourself,

312
00:30:20,086 --> 00:30:21,294
say a few words to the group?

313
00:30:48,962 --> 00:30:50,212
What the fuck's your problem?

314
00:30:53,171 --> 00:30:54,962
What the fuck's wrong with you?

315
00:30:55,379 --> 00:30:56,463
What's wrong with you?

316
00:30:56,547 --> 00:30:58,878
You let that fucking asshole
stick my head in the toilet.

317
00:30:58,963 --> 00:31:01,713
You just stand there and watch him do it.

318
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:04,630
Get out.

319
00:31:04,713 --> 00:31:06,088
Get out of my grandma's house!

320
00:31:06,589 --> 00:31:07,796
Get out.

321
00:31:08,670 --> 00:31:10,462
Get the fuck off me.

322
00:31:20,964 --> 00:31:22,337
I'm going to put some clothes on.

323
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:25,798
You meet me outside in my van, all right?

324
00:31:38,338 --> 00:31:42,799
Where are we going?

325
00:32:09,175 --> 00:32:10,631
What are we doing here?

326
00:32:11,842 --> 00:32:13,716
Let's get out of here.

327
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,133
Come on.

328
00:32:19,509 --> 00:32:20,507
What are you doing?

329
00:32:31,009 --> 00:32:33,550
What are we doing here?

330
00:32:34,343 --> 00:32:36,092
What are you doing?

331
00:32:36,552 --> 00:32:38,425
Let's get out of here.

332
00:32:38,843 --> 00:32:39,967
Shit.

333
00:32:43,761 --> 00:32:46,176
Come on, man. Let's just get out of here.

334
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:48,303
Please. What are you doing?

335
00:32:49,927 --> 00:32:51,717
What is that? What...

336
00:32:51,802 --> 00:32:52,885
Stop.

337
00:32:56,471 --> 00:32:57,969
Stop. You can't do...

338
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:02,052
You got gas on my head.

339
00:33:20,428 --> 00:33:22,720
Come on. Let's go.

340
00:33:23,803 --> 00:33:24,970
Stop.

341
00:33:29,305 --> 00:33:30,763
Just go home.

342
00:33:36,887 --> 00:33:38,969
Shit. No. No, no, no.

343
00:33:39,596 --> 00:33:41,220
This isn't funny. Come on.

344
00:33:42,346 --> 00:33:43,971
Come on. Just go.

345
00:33:44,057 --> 00:33:46,512
Come on, man. Just get out of here.

346
00:33:46,597 --> 00:33:48,221
Please, no. Stop.

347
00:33:48,305 --> 00:33:49,803
No, no, no.

348
00:33:50,554 --> 00:33:52,554
What the hell's your problem!

349
00:33:53,598 --> 00:33:54,555
Come on! Let's go, quick!

350
00:33:56,514 --> 00:33:58,596
Come on! Let's go! Hurry up!

351
00:33:59,805 --> 00:34:01,138
Come on!

352
00:34:04,555 --> 00:34:07,181
Shit. The car's locked. Open it up!

353
00:34:07,638 --> 00:34:09,221
Open the door.
It's locked.

354
00:34:10,389 --> 00:34:13,682
Open the door!

355
00:34:13,766 --> 00:34:14,847
Shit!

356
00:34:15,474 --> 00:34:16,805
What the fuck?

357
00:34:16,890 --> 00:34:18,305
Hey! Hey!

358
00:34:50,598 --> 00:34:51,724
Get in the van.

359
00:34:51,807 --> 00:34:52,849
No.

360
00:34:52,934 --> 00:34:54,309
Get in the fucking van, now.

361
00:34:56,892 --> 00:34:58,016
I'm going to run you over.

362
00:35:18,684 --> 00:35:19,808
Dude?

363
00:35:28,269 --> 00:35:30,310
Dude, that was fucking awesome.

364
00:35:33,102 --> 00:35:35,433
You flew, like, fucking five feet.

365
00:35:36,810 --> 00:35:37,809
Oh!

366
00:35:54,395 --> 00:35:55,851
Okay.

367
00:35:56,603 --> 00:35:57,852
Let's go.

368
00:36:00,604 --> 00:36:02,186
Fuck.

369
00:36:06,812 --> 00:36:08,063
Come on.

370
00:36:39,065 --> 00:36:42,106
Hello, ma'am. I'm Officer Haywood.
This is Officer Jordan.

371
00:36:42,605 --> 00:36:45,021
We need to speak to Thomas Forney.

372
00:36:46,481 --> 00:36:48,519
- Tommy?
- Thomas Forney.

373
00:36:48,938 --> 00:36:50,312
Is he here?

374
00:36:50,856 --> 00:36:52,731
Are you Thomas Forney?

375
00:36:53,149 --> 00:36:56,148
Um, yeah.

376
00:36:58,066 --> 00:36:59,814
We'd like to ask you some questions.

377
00:36:59,981 --> 00:37:01,855
It's just some questions, dude.

378
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:02,981
What about?

379
00:37:03,066 --> 00:37:05,229
Can you get dressed, please?

380
00:37:18,065 --> 00:37:19,563
Let this be a warning to you.

381
00:37:19,648 --> 00:37:21,899
Regardless of what evidence
we find or don't,

382
00:37:21,984 --> 00:37:24,105
you've come to our attention today.

383
00:37:25,274 --> 00:37:26,524
Turn left.

384
00:37:26,608 --> 00:37:27,982
Our attention's not good.

385
00:37:29,066 --> 00:37:30,899
These are felony offenses.

386
00:37:30,983 --> 00:37:32,774
Serious jail time offenses.

387
00:37:38,193 --> 00:37:39,691
Did you do it?

388
00:37:42,316 --> 00:37:43,650
Not really.

389
00:37:44,066 --> 00:37:45,482
Not really?

390
00:37:45,734 --> 00:37:47,274
I didn't do it.

391
00:37:49,982 --> 00:37:51,485
You just said not really.

392
00:37:52,486 --> 00:37:53,774
What does that mean, "not really"?

393
00:37:54,234 --> 00:37:55,358
I said I didn't do it, okay?

394
00:37:55,485 --> 00:37:57,234
Okay. Before that,
I asked you if you did it,

395
00:37:57,318 --> 00:37:59,359
and you said "not really".

396
00:38:00,442 --> 00:38:02,027
I can't remember what I said.

397
00:38:04,984 --> 00:38:06,816
Why would you do
something like that?

398
00:38:18,068 --> 00:38:19,194
Want a peanut?

399
00:38:19,276 --> 00:38:20,319
No.

400
00:38:28,319 --> 00:38:30,151
So, what'd the pigs want?

401
00:38:31,195 --> 00:38:33,069
What the fuck do you think?

402
00:38:33,154 --> 00:38:34,567
I don't know.

403
00:38:34,652 --> 00:38:35,985
They give you a cavity search?

404
00:38:36,652 --> 00:38:38,403
Just fuck off, okay?

405
00:38:38,487 --> 00:38:40,319
What? What'd they do?

406
00:38:40,403 --> 00:38:41,943
They took my fucking fingerprints.

407
00:38:42,488 --> 00:38:44,694
Mmm-hmm. Yeah, so?

408
00:38:45,944 --> 00:38:47,694
Just leave me alone.

409
00:38:50,821 --> 00:38:53,611
All right, I'll go. But on one condition.

410
00:39:53,282 --> 00:39:55,491
Do you think she shaves her pussy?

411
00:39:56,157 --> 00:39:57,156
What are you doing here?

412
00:39:57,241 --> 00:39:59,406
What are you doing here, dude?
You're not shopping.

413
00:39:59,491 --> 00:40:00,698
You're stalking that chick.

414
00:40:00,949 --> 00:40:02,363
- No, I'm not.
- Yeah, you are.

415
00:40:02,490 --> 00:40:03,447
I've been following you.

416
00:40:03,530 --> 00:40:04,738
You going to try and fuck her?

417
00:40:04,824 --> 00:40:06,948
- No.
- Well, that's good.

418
00:40:07,659 --> 00:40:10,324
You can't fuck her from here, dude.
Got to be way closer.

419
00:40:10,823 --> 00:40:12,198
What?

420
00:40:13,326 --> 00:40:14,405
Hey, you want to poke her?

421
00:40:14,491 --> 00:40:15,699
Shut up.

422
00:40:15,866 --> 00:40:18,115
Dude, there's nothing wrong
with wanting to poke her.

423
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:19,825
Stop saying that.

424
00:40:19,909 --> 00:40:21,740
Dude, if you want to poke her,

425
00:40:21,826 --> 00:40:23,616
there's nothing wrong with that.
Don't be ashamed.

426
00:40:23,699 --> 00:40:26,407
Human beings have been poking
vagina for hundreds of years.

427
00:40:26,491 --> 00:40:28,157
Longer, probably.

428
00:40:28,326 --> 00:40:29,407
Bro.

429
00:40:30,117 --> 00:40:32,156
Seriously, there's nothing
wrong with wanting some pussy.

430
00:40:43,658 --> 00:40:45,283
Where you going?

431
00:40:45,534 --> 00:40:46,908
Home.

432
00:40:46,992 --> 00:40:48,824
I'll give you a ride.

433
00:40:48,911 --> 00:40:50,283
No, thanks.

434
00:40:52,451 --> 00:40:53,493
Well, all right.

435
00:40:53,576 --> 00:40:55,409
But if you go with me,
it will take you five minutes.

436
00:40:55,494 --> 00:40:57,618
Ride the bike, it's like, what, 15?

437
00:41:02,243 --> 00:41:03,492
Fine.

438
00:41:04,453 --> 00:41:05,743
But don't talk to me, okay?

439
00:41:06,162 --> 00:41:07,494
I won't say shit.

440
00:41:17,494 --> 00:41:18,869
Listen, man.

441
00:41:20,163 --> 00:41:21,328
I'm sorry about the fire the other night.

442
00:41:21,409 --> 00:41:22,951
That was, uh...

443
00:41:24,161 --> 00:41:26,828
That was totally out of control, and...

444
00:41:26,912 --> 00:41:29,619
It was foolish and irresponsible, really.

445
00:41:29,913 --> 00:41:32,161
So, I'm sorry.

446
00:41:32,911 --> 00:41:33,993
But, uh, here.

447
00:41:35,370 --> 00:41:36,869
I want you to have this.

448
00:41:36,955 --> 00:41:38,411
Get that away from me.

449
00:41:40,454 --> 00:41:42,994
Dude, are you gay? I don't...

450
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:45,495
Well, I can't work you out.

451
00:41:48,370 --> 00:41:49,704
Oh, shit.

452
00:41:59,663 --> 00:42:00,788
What are you doing?

453
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:06,746
Stop the car. I want to get out.
Stop the car...

454
00:42:06,831 --> 00:42:09,163
Get out of this van, and I will rip
your dick off and fuck her for you.

455
00:42:52,875 --> 00:42:53,998
Oh! Whoops.

456
00:42:55,582 --> 00:42:56,915
That's fucked up.

457
00:42:58,833 --> 00:43:00,663
Sorry. I'm so sorry. I don't know...

458
00:43:00,748 --> 00:43:02,915
Just messed up the back of my car,

459
00:43:02,999 --> 00:43:04,750
you stupid idiot.

460
00:43:05,291 --> 00:43:06,624
Oh, my God.

461
00:43:06,708 --> 00:43:08,624
You're a fucking idiot.

462
00:43:09,459 --> 00:43:10,957
Lady, you're an absolute idiot.

463
00:43:11,293 --> 00:43:12,957
What is the matter with you?

464
00:43:13,166 --> 00:43:15,083
I don't know what happened, sir.

465
00:43:15,166 --> 00:43:18,376
You need to pay attention
when you are driving a fucking car.

466
00:43:19,043 --> 00:43:20,499
Yeah, I think I can be of some help here.

467
00:43:20,708 --> 00:43:22,791
- Oh.
- I saw the whole thing.

468
00:43:23,125 --> 00:43:24,750
She was just sitting there.
You backed right into her.

469
00:43:24,833 --> 00:43:26,040
I what?

470
00:43:26,334 --> 00:43:27,417
I don't know what's wrong with you, man.

471
00:43:27,501 --> 00:43:29,583
Why would you back into a car?
It's fucking retarded.

472
00:43:29,669 --> 00:43:31,333
I don't know what you're talking about.

473
00:43:32,292 --> 00:43:34,418
You should probably start talking
about paying for her damages.

474
00:43:34,502 --> 00:43:36,501
- Look at this shit.
- I did not back into her.

475
00:43:40,126 --> 00:43:41,666
Calling me a fucking liar?

476
00:43:41,753 --> 00:43:44,126
Look, I don't... What is going on here?

477
00:43:47,878 --> 00:43:49,585
I don't know. Sounds like
you're calling me a fucking liar.

478
00:43:49,669 --> 00:43:50,834
No...

479
00:43:53,420 --> 00:43:54,459
Okay. All right. All right.

480
00:43:54,544 --> 00:43:55,708
I don't want any trouble here.

481
00:43:55,795 --> 00:43:57,293
- You don't want any trouble?
- No.

482
00:43:57,834 --> 00:43:59,874
I think you do, Miss Piggy.

483
00:44:03,212 --> 00:44:05,002
This is ridiculous.

484
00:44:37,171 --> 00:44:39,921
Come on, dude. Let's just get out of here.

485
00:44:40,672 --> 00:44:43,003
Dude, your sexy girlfriend's in trouble.

486
00:44:43,087 --> 00:44:44,087
I'm not going anywhere.

487
00:45:05,507 --> 00:45:07,005
You guys know each other?

488
00:45:10,757 --> 00:45:11,837
Hi.

489
00:45:21,465 --> 00:45:24,173
Sometimes, you know, a day is bad,

490
00:45:24,757 --> 00:45:26,880
and you think it couldn't get any worse,

491
00:45:26,965 --> 00:45:28,796
and then, suddenly you discover

492
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:30,670
whole new ways it can get worse.

493
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:37,173
No, thanks.

494
00:45:39,757 --> 00:45:40,922
Get that away from me.

495
00:45:43,255 --> 00:45:45,215
This one time, a couple of years back,

496
00:45:45,299 --> 00:45:47,008
I had these four chicks
in the back of the van,

497
00:45:47,092 --> 00:45:50,215
and we're all, like, super fucking wasted
and going for it, right?

498
00:45:50,299 --> 00:45:51,716
So I was eating this one chick out,

499
00:45:52,050 --> 00:45:53,590
I was fingering another chick,

500
00:45:54,052 --> 00:45:56,257
but there's still two chicks, right,
and they want to get off.

501
00:45:56,342 --> 00:45:58,175
So I got my other hand
fingering this other chick,

502
00:45:58,259 --> 00:46:00,423
and I got my toe rubbing on
the fourth chick's asshole

503
00:46:00,507 --> 00:46:01,549
and I was going crazy, man.

504
00:46:01,633 --> 00:46:02,634
It was like, "This is too much".

505
00:46:02,717 --> 00:46:05,592
You know, I was like,
couldn't tell which chick was which.

506
00:46:05,676 --> 00:46:08,299
Tongue started to hurt.
Fingers getting tired.

507
00:46:09,967 --> 00:46:11,509
I stepped back.

508
00:46:13,010 --> 00:46:15,259
You know what happened?

509
00:46:17,343 --> 00:46:18,840
These chicks just start working
on each other.

510
00:46:19,509 --> 00:46:22,092
They're fingering each other,
eating each other out.

511
00:46:22,176 --> 00:46:23,841
I just sat back and watched the whole thing.

512
00:46:24,467 --> 00:46:26,634
I just whipped my cock out,
jerked myself off.

513
00:46:27,009 --> 00:46:28,758
Everyone's a winner.

514
00:46:32,844 --> 00:46:35,843
Was that some kind of
perverted metaphor for me?

515
00:46:36,469 --> 00:46:37,842
A what?

516
00:46:38,344 --> 00:46:39,884
Never mind.

517
00:46:52,178 --> 00:46:54,052
Whoa! Stop!

518
00:46:54,845 --> 00:46:56,969
I mean it! What are you doing?

519
00:46:59,220 --> 00:47:01,177
You're gonna kill us!

520
00:47:01,471 --> 00:47:03,887
Please, stop! Are you fucking crazy?

521
00:47:12,969 --> 00:47:14,595
The fuck was that?

522
00:47:15,097 --> 00:47:16,387
I saw a mouse.

523
00:47:16,471 --> 00:47:18,844
What? You okay?

524
00:47:20,514 --> 00:47:22,303
I think I have dirt in my mouth.

525
00:47:25,471 --> 00:47:26,554
Yeah.

526
00:47:45,057 --> 00:47:47,261
So, what are we doing?

527
00:48:18,349 --> 00:48:19,680
All right.

528
00:48:22,348 --> 00:48:23,389
We're here.

529
00:48:23,473 --> 00:48:24,847
We're where?

530
00:48:25,225 --> 00:48:26,306
Come on.

531
00:48:34,516 --> 00:48:36,015
Where are we?

532
00:48:36,764 --> 00:48:38,515
What's that?

533
00:48:39,015 --> 00:48:40,807
Whose house is this?

534
00:48:41,474 --> 00:48:44,100
Yeah. No, I don't really like anything.

535
00:48:47,684 --> 00:48:49,016
Excuse me.

536
00:48:50,849 --> 00:48:52,474
- I'm talking to you.
- Hmm?

537
00:48:55,436 --> 00:48:57,265
Whose house is this?

538
00:48:57,768 --> 00:48:59,516
- This house?
- Yeah.

539
00:49:00,392 --> 00:49:01,476
My uncle's house.

540
00:49:03,392 --> 00:49:05,184
Well, where is your uncle?

541
00:49:07,060 --> 00:49:08,183
- Right over there.
- Where?

542
00:49:09,351 --> 00:49:10,517
Oh!

543
00:49:14,685 --> 00:49:16,351
What the fuck?

544
00:49:17,101 --> 00:49:18,184
Well, you were dirty.

545
00:49:18,518 --> 00:49:20,352
Yeah, now I'm wet.

546
00:49:21,144 --> 00:49:23,642
Oh, you're dirty and wet? I'm coming in.

547
00:49:28,184 --> 00:49:29,517
Now I'm dirty and wet, too.

548
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:37,643
R-2!

549
00:49:39,477 --> 00:49:42,726
R-2! Shut down all
the fucking trash compactors!

550
00:49:44,227 --> 00:49:45,520
All the...

551
00:49:46,020 --> 00:49:49,187
R-2!

552
00:49:50,354 --> 00:49:52,353
All the fucking...

553
00:49:52,436 --> 00:49:55,186
Trash compactors on the detention level.

554
00:49:55,270 --> 00:49:57,895
Oh, shit! There's more trash coming in!

555
00:49:58,187 --> 00:49:59,185
Motherfuck!

556
00:50:00,939 --> 00:50:02,521
Motherfuck!

557
00:50:31,023 --> 00:50:32,854
How do you know this guy?

558
00:50:34,647 --> 00:50:36,855
I don't know. He's sort of moved in

559
00:50:36,939 --> 00:50:39,020
my grandma's house with us.

560
00:50:41,064 --> 00:50:44,439
What, you mean he's, like,
renting a room or something?

561
00:50:44,525 --> 00:50:46,063
No, not really.

562
00:50:51,022 --> 00:50:52,439
It's kind of a long story.

563
00:50:57,605 --> 00:50:58,690
Fish!

564
00:50:59,399 --> 00:51:00,940
Fresh fish!

565
00:51:14,691 --> 00:51:15,857
Fire.

566
00:51:29,901 --> 00:51:31,484
Fuck you, bitches!

567
00:51:31,566 --> 00:51:32,691
Whoo!

568
00:51:34,109 --> 00:51:35,190
Whoa.

569
00:51:38,525 --> 00:51:40,358
Jump in the fire.

570
00:51:41,026 --> 00:51:43,193
I got a doctor's appointment.

571
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:45,483
What?

572
00:51:48,277 --> 00:51:50,235
It burns when I urinate.

573
00:51:57,902 --> 00:51:59,402
Did he just leave us here?

574
00:52:00,692 --> 00:52:01,692
I think so.

575
00:52:01,860 --> 00:52:03,360
I think we should get out of here.

576
00:52:03,443 --> 00:52:04,692
Let's go.

577
00:52:09,193 --> 00:52:10,275
So what's his name?

578
00:52:12,694 --> 00:52:13,861
Hesher.

579
00:52:14,028 --> 00:52:15,901
Hesher? Is that a name?

580
00:52:16,777 --> 00:52:18,235
I don't know.

581
00:52:18,945 --> 00:52:20,360
Does he have a last name?

582
00:52:20,903 --> 00:52:22,361
I don't know.

583
00:52:27,736 --> 00:52:29,653
My shoes are so squishy.

584
00:52:29,946 --> 00:52:31,445
How old is he?

585
00:52:32,237 --> 00:52:33,277
I don't know.

586
00:52:33,362 --> 00:52:35,110
Do you know anything about him?

587
00:52:36,027 --> 00:52:37,528
No, not really.

588
00:52:37,985 --> 00:52:39,819
Man, that was lucky you were behind me

589
00:52:39,903 --> 00:52:42,569
when that guy got all mad about his car.

590
00:52:43,655 --> 00:52:46,694
I was freaking out.
I don't have insurance right now

591
00:52:46,778 --> 00:52:48,986
because I can't really afford it.

592
00:52:49,071 --> 00:52:51,902
And there's no way
I could afford to fix his car.

593
00:52:51,987 --> 00:52:54,111
How do people do this stuff?

594
00:52:54,945 --> 00:52:56,737
I mean, I have a job.

595
00:52:57,530 --> 00:52:59,986
It's kind of a joke.
I mean, I've been there almost a year,

596
00:53:00,071 --> 00:53:03,071
and I still have only, like,
15 hours a week.

597
00:53:04,197 --> 00:53:06,613
Why don't they give me more hours?

598
00:53:07,113 --> 00:53:09,946
Do you think it's 'cause they think I suck?

599
00:53:10,780 --> 00:53:14,363
Did you think I sucked
when I served you at the checkout?

600
00:53:14,822 --> 00:53:15,862
No.

601
00:53:16,364 --> 00:53:19,695
I mean, I can't even afford
to pay my rent right now.

602
00:53:19,906 --> 00:53:23,198
I'm going to have
to start selling shit pretty soon.

603
00:53:24,155 --> 00:53:25,528
Here. Um...

604
00:53:26,738 --> 00:53:27,988
I, uh...

605
00:53:29,697 --> 00:53:31,279
I got two bucks.

606
00:53:32,907 --> 00:53:36,196
The sad thing is,
I could actually use it right now.

607
00:53:36,323 --> 00:53:38,114
- Then here. You can have it.
- No.

608
00:53:43,990 --> 00:53:45,197
Oh, no.

609
00:53:45,533 --> 00:53:48,031
Please tell me that's not a ticket.

610
00:53:48,157 --> 00:53:49,364
Oh, no.

611
00:53:52,118 --> 00:53:53,322
Fuck!

612
00:53:53,739 --> 00:53:55,404
Fuck, fuck! Fuck!

613
00:53:55,491 --> 00:53:58,200
Ow. Ow! Ow.

614
00:53:58,699 --> 00:54:00,281
Fuck. Shit.

615
00:54:30,243 --> 00:54:34,533
What did I do to deserve
this chain reaction of shit all the time?

616
00:54:39,785 --> 00:54:42,202
You know, I feel like if I died,

617
00:54:42,617 --> 00:54:44,617
no one would even notice.

618
00:54:57,954 --> 00:54:59,451
Well, I would.

619
00:55:03,993 --> 00:55:06,284
If you were to die right now,
I would notice.

620
00:55:12,494 --> 00:55:16,160
Mainly because I'd be sitting in a car
next to a dead lady.

621
00:55:18,411 --> 00:55:20,452
Please don't call me lady.

622
00:55:45,953 --> 00:55:47,204
Hi, T.J.

623
00:55:47,288 --> 00:55:48,702
Hi, Grandma.

624
00:55:48,831 --> 00:55:49,911
So...

625
00:55:52,371 --> 00:55:53,744
You fuck her?

626
00:55:53,829 --> 00:55:54,912
No.

627
00:55:56,206 --> 00:55:58,330
Where were you today?

628
00:55:59,413 --> 00:56:02,871
Counseling.
3:30. I'm there by myself.

629
00:56:03,373 --> 00:56:04,955
Sorry. I forgot.

630
00:56:05,579 --> 00:56:07,454
Oh, that's real nice.

631
00:56:09,581 --> 00:56:11,870
You know, it's just as much
for you as it is for me.

632
00:56:11,996 --> 00:56:14,247
I waited outside the school for 45 minutes.

633
00:56:14,331 --> 00:56:16,248
Yeah, well, I told you I don't want to go.

634
00:56:16,331 --> 00:56:19,496
Well, maybe you could let me know
when you decide not to show next time.

635
00:56:19,580 --> 00:56:21,371
- I did. I told you I didn't want to go.
- No, you didn't.

636
00:56:21,455 --> 00:56:22,746
I told you, like, a thousand times.

637
00:56:22,832 --> 00:56:23,913
- No, you didn't.
- Yes, I did.

638
00:56:23,998 --> 00:56:25,123
You're just not listening.

639
00:56:25,207 --> 00:56:26,331
You didn't tell me that.

640
00:56:26,416 --> 00:56:27,998
You told me you didn't want to go.

641
00:56:28,082 --> 00:56:29,747
You didn't tell me you were just
going to not show up.

642
00:56:30,374 --> 00:56:31,955
What difference does it make?

643
00:56:32,040 --> 00:56:34,039
For me, a big difference.

644
00:56:34,541 --> 00:56:37,831
Means I'm sitting in
a room full of losers by myself.

645
00:56:39,084 --> 00:56:41,164
Boys, please.

646
00:56:41,457 --> 00:56:43,498
I'm not feeling very well.

647
00:56:49,667 --> 00:56:51,331
Please pass me my pills.

648
00:57:12,667 --> 00:57:13,917
Did you finger her twat?

649
00:57:14,002 --> 00:57:15,125
Shut the fuck up!

650
00:57:15,208 --> 00:57:16,251
- T.J.!
- What?

651
00:57:16,334 --> 00:57:17,791
Language. I mean it.

652
00:57:17,876 --> 00:57:19,334
- Did you hear what he just said?
- It doesn't matter.

653
00:57:19,417 --> 00:57:21,164
You talk like that again,
you're going to your room.

654
00:57:21,251 --> 00:57:23,708
My room?
You're going to start punishing me now?

655
00:57:23,793 --> 00:57:25,543
Yeah. Maybe I am.
If it's not the language,

656
00:57:25,626 --> 00:57:27,126
then it's your lack of responsibility.

657
00:57:29,251 --> 00:57:32,084
Me having to escort you
to the police station.

658
00:57:34,376 --> 00:57:35,583
Shit, Dad. I'm really sorry

659
00:57:35,668 --> 00:57:37,377
you had your ass dragged off the couch.

660
00:57:37,459 --> 00:57:39,417
And I'm sorry you had to put
some fucking underpants on

661
00:57:39,502 --> 00:57:40,625
for the first time in months.

662
00:57:40,710 --> 00:57:42,000
- T.J.!
- What!

663
00:57:42,086 --> 00:57:44,542
Hey! That's enough.

664
00:57:45,377 --> 00:57:46,709
So as soon as I'm right,
that's enough?

665
00:57:47,503 --> 00:57:49,919
I don't want to hear another word from you.

666
00:57:50,002 --> 00:57:51,084
Fine.

667
00:57:51,419 --> 00:57:52,876
Fuck this!

668
00:57:55,379 --> 00:57:57,211
That make you happy, huh?

669
00:58:19,796 --> 00:58:20,919
Did I miss something?

670
00:58:22,629 --> 00:58:24,002
Not really.

671
00:58:24,463 --> 00:58:25,962
He said some dumb shit.

672
00:58:26,046 --> 00:58:27,878
He smashed his plate,

673
00:58:28,005 --> 00:58:29,087
so he smashed his.

674
00:58:30,045 --> 00:58:32,378
But I think he just did it
'cause he couldn't think of anything to say.

675
00:58:32,462 --> 00:58:33,877
The kid had a point.

676
00:58:35,130 --> 00:58:37,170
So he felt bad about himself.

677
00:58:37,255 --> 00:58:38,754
He left. I don't know where...

678
00:58:43,963 --> 00:58:45,214
I wish...

679
00:58:45,547 --> 00:58:48,671
I wish there were something more I could do.

680
00:59:14,965 --> 00:59:16,004
It's delicious.

681
00:59:16,090 --> 00:59:17,882
Oh. Thank you, dear.

682
00:59:23,966 --> 00:59:25,298
Hey.

683
00:59:25,383 --> 00:59:27,256
What's green and slimy
and smells like bacon?

684
00:59:29,008 --> 00:59:30,714
I don't know, dear.

685
00:59:33,549 --> 00:59:35,632
Think about it. What's green and slimy

686
00:59:35,716 --> 00:59:36,924
and smells like bacon?

687
00:59:37,009 --> 00:59:38,675
A worm? I don't know.

688
00:59:40,507 --> 00:59:43,548
Going to lie down.
Still not feeling too well.

689
00:59:46,135 --> 00:59:47,465
All right.

690
01:00:06,051 --> 01:00:07,175
Hey.

691
01:00:07,593 --> 01:00:08,798
You figure it out?

692
01:00:08,884 --> 01:00:10,174
Figure what out, dear?

693
01:00:11,801 --> 01:00:14,715
What's green and slimy
and smells like bacon?

694
01:00:16,760 --> 01:00:18,510
I don't know. Uh...

695
01:00:19,050 --> 01:00:20,715
Would you do me a favor, please?

696
01:00:20,801 --> 01:00:21,842
Yeah.

697
01:00:21,927 --> 01:00:23,844
Could you hand me that old container

698
01:00:23,928 --> 01:00:26,009
on top of the cabinet?

699
01:00:26,759 --> 01:00:27,968
Which one? This one?

700
01:00:28,052 --> 01:00:29,677
Yeah. Thank you.

701
01:00:36,137 --> 01:00:38,344
It's Kermit the Frog's finger.

702
01:00:39,303 --> 01:00:42,051
You know, 'cause Miss Piggy.

703
01:00:43,761 --> 01:00:45,134
What's that?

704
01:00:45,219 --> 01:00:48,053
Oh, they're medical cigarettes
to help with the nausea.

705
01:00:48,635 --> 01:00:50,969
Would you please light a match for me?

706
01:00:51,052 --> 01:00:53,554
Yeah. Can I just see that real quick?

707
01:00:59,887 --> 01:01:01,636
I'll be right back.

708
01:01:07,264 --> 01:01:08,343
May I?

709
01:01:11,095 --> 01:01:12,302
Thanks.

710
01:01:12,722 --> 01:01:14,220
What is that?

711
01:01:14,637 --> 01:01:16,178
That is a bong.

712
01:01:17,388 --> 01:01:19,219
It's got water in it. It filters the smoke.

713
01:01:19,303 --> 01:01:21,178
It's actually probably
the healthiest way to smoke weed.

714
01:01:25,055 --> 01:01:26,553
I'll show you how to do it.

715
01:01:27,263 --> 01:01:28,470
You see that hole right there?

716
01:01:28,556 --> 01:01:30,637
You got to keep your finger on that.

717
01:01:30,721 --> 01:01:32,720
Then, you light the bowl.

718
01:01:38,972 --> 01:01:40,512
Then, when the thing
fills up with smoke like that,

719
01:01:40,597 --> 01:01:43,012
you let go right here. Then you...

720
01:01:44,888 --> 01:01:46,556
Here.

721
01:01:48,054 --> 01:01:49,470
Here you go.

722
01:01:52,557 --> 01:01:53,763
I'll light it for you. Here.

723
01:01:53,848 --> 01:01:55,014
Just turn it like that.

724
01:01:55,099 --> 01:01:57,431
Hang on. Put your thumb
on the hole right there.

725
01:01:57,890 --> 01:02:00,681
I'll light this, and you suck. Okay? Yeah.

726
01:02:02,348 --> 01:02:04,056
Go ahead and suck.

727
01:02:06,432 --> 01:02:08,098
Yeah. Here you go.

728
01:02:09,891 --> 01:02:12,306
Put your thumb. Big breath. Breath.

729
01:02:14,557 --> 01:02:15,682
Yeah.

730
01:02:21,724 --> 01:02:23,431
Oh, my.

731
01:02:24,558 --> 01:02:26,223
Hit it again. Hmm?

732
01:02:27,349 --> 01:02:28,683
No. I...

733
01:02:30,224 --> 01:02:32,806
I think I'm okay. Thank you.

734
01:02:32,891 --> 01:02:35,683
All right. I'll just finish this off.

735
01:02:48,224 --> 01:02:50,643
Honey, how old are you?

736
01:02:52,061 --> 01:02:53,183
Who wants to know?

737
01:02:54,310 --> 01:02:55,768
I don't know.

738
01:02:57,560 --> 01:02:59,641
You seem a little older than T.J.

739
01:03:01,726 --> 01:03:02,767
Who?

740
01:03:02,851 --> 01:03:04,226
Oh, stop it.

741
01:03:06,228 --> 01:03:09,351
Aren't you a little old
to be hanging around T.J. all the time?

742
01:03:09,894 --> 01:03:11,142
Aren't you?

743
01:03:11,226 --> 01:03:13,725
No. I'm his grandmother.

744
01:03:16,228 --> 01:03:17,601
That's true.

745
01:03:21,479 --> 01:03:23,727
You know, I...

746
01:03:23,811 --> 01:03:26,394
I used to have this snake. Big fucker.

747
01:03:28,560 --> 01:03:29,685
I used to have to feed him.

748
01:03:29,768 --> 01:03:31,725
Once a week, I'd give him a live mouse.

749
01:03:31,810 --> 01:03:33,394
- Hmm.
- Yeah.

750
01:03:33,727 --> 01:03:36,475
You know, snakes. You know they're snakes

751
01:03:37,061 --> 01:03:39,394
because they're the right shape.

752
01:03:42,228 --> 01:03:44,728
Huh. Well, anyway, this one ate mice.

753
01:03:46,145 --> 01:03:48,102
And there was this one time

754
01:03:48,186 --> 01:03:50,395
I dropped a mouse in his cage,

755
01:03:50,604 --> 01:03:53,561
and he got a whiff of it,
so he went for him,

756
01:03:55,229 --> 01:03:56,727
and this mouse

757
01:03:58,228 --> 01:04:00,144
got up on his hind legs

758
01:04:00,395 --> 01:04:01,645
and punched him in the face.

759
01:04:01,727 --> 01:04:03,770
- You're kidding.
- Mmm-mmm.

760
01:04:04,604 --> 01:04:06,980
Happened again, too.
The snake went for him again.

761
01:04:07,063 --> 01:04:08,563
Hit him again.

762
01:04:10,105 --> 01:04:11,145
Snake didn't know what to do.

763
01:04:11,230 --> 01:04:12,686
Got a little fucked up.

764
01:04:12,770 --> 01:04:15,105
Went off in the corner and cried.

765
01:04:15,856 --> 01:04:17,479
And that fucking mouse ruled the cage.

766
01:04:18,186 --> 01:04:19,938
Went on for weeks. He just, like,

767
01:04:20,022 --> 01:04:22,605
walked around like he owned the joint.

768
01:04:23,065 --> 01:04:25,854
Sitting in a little lawn chair or something,

769
01:04:25,938 --> 01:04:27,938
scratching his balls, shelling peanuts.

770
01:04:28,021 --> 01:04:30,478
I mean, like, defiant.

771
01:04:32,731 --> 01:04:35,148
Yeah. I tried to feed him other mice, too.

772
01:04:35,232 --> 01:04:37,105
But I'd drop the new mouse into the cage,

773
01:04:37,188 --> 01:04:39,481
and he'd just hide behind the old mouse.

774
01:04:39,564 --> 01:04:42,063
The snake's scared shitless.

775
01:04:43,439 --> 01:04:45,438
He died. Starved to death.

776
01:04:47,897 --> 01:04:48,980
Yeah.

777
01:04:49,566 --> 01:04:51,231
Cage full of mice.

778
01:04:52,524 --> 01:04:54,397
So is T.J. the mouse?

779
01:04:58,440 --> 01:05:00,481
I don't know. Maybe he is.

780
01:05:02,108 --> 01:05:03,358
Who the hell am I?

781
01:05:03,733 --> 01:05:04,816
You?

782
01:05:05,940 --> 01:05:07,690
You're an old lady.

783
01:05:08,065 --> 01:05:09,065
No.

784
01:05:10,775 --> 01:05:12,439
I'm a grandmother.

785
01:05:14,108 --> 01:05:16,816
Yeah. You're a grandmother.

786
01:05:19,609 --> 01:05:21,109
You know what?

787
01:05:21,359 --> 01:05:24,150
Grandmother, I'm going to go
on that walk with you tomorrow morning.

788
01:05:25,191 --> 01:05:27,982
Oh, no. That's nice.

789
01:05:31,151 --> 01:05:32,233
Where are you going?

790
01:05:32,943 --> 01:05:34,733
I want to go with you.

791
01:05:34,820 --> 01:05:36,776
Wherever. Around the block, I guess.

792
01:05:36,859 --> 01:05:37,900
Hmm.

793
01:05:39,442 --> 01:05:40,650
Well...

794
01:05:43,068 --> 01:05:44,526
Good timing.

795
01:05:44,610 --> 01:05:45,817
No, I'm going to go with you.

796
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:47,108
Well...

797
01:05:48,276 --> 01:05:50,069
See you when you get back.

798
01:08:02,491 --> 01:08:04,447
Why don't you send him over? Sure.

799
01:08:04,949 --> 01:08:06,616
Can I talk to you?

800
01:08:07,075 --> 01:08:09,241
Hold on a minute. I'm on the phone.
Can you see that?

801
01:08:09,325 --> 01:08:10,324
I need to talk to you.

802
01:08:10,408 --> 01:08:12,451
I'm on the... Wait outside.

803
01:08:13,532 --> 01:08:14,992
Wait outside.

804
01:08:31,660 --> 01:08:34,325
Did you come here
so I can break your fucking neck?

805
01:08:36,660 --> 01:08:37,742
What?

806
01:08:37,909 --> 01:08:39,283
I got the money.

807
01:08:39,369 --> 01:08:40,408
What money?

808
01:08:40,494 --> 01:08:43,158
You said if I got $1,800,
then I could have the car back.

809
01:08:43,242 --> 01:08:46,492
Are you kidding?
I said even if you had $1,800,

810
01:08:46,577 --> 01:08:47,869
I still couldn't sell it to you.

811
01:08:47,952 --> 01:08:49,367
It's not here anymore, anyway.

812
01:08:49,451 --> 01:08:50,493
What do you mean?

813
01:08:50,578 --> 01:08:54,076
I feel like I've had this conversation
too many times already. But I'm telling you,

814
01:08:54,162 --> 01:08:55,659
I'm not going to have it again,
because the car's gone.

815
01:08:55,744 --> 01:08:57,826
- What are you talking about?
- It's not here.

816
01:08:57,910 --> 01:08:59,076
It's over. It's gone.

817
01:08:59,162 --> 01:09:00,160
Well, where's it gone?

818
01:09:00,244 --> 01:09:01,911
Kid, it's all over. Go.

819
01:09:02,826 --> 01:09:04,785
Goodbye. Go.

820
01:10:19,914 --> 01:10:21,498
What's going on?

821
01:10:53,916 --> 01:10:55,874
I got to get the fuck out of here
before I hurt somebody.

822
01:11:50,503 --> 01:11:52,711
Hi, it's Nicole. I'm not in right now.

823
01:11:52,795 --> 01:11:54,377
Leave a message, and I'll call you back.

824
01:11:56,127 --> 01:11:58,587
Um, hi. It's T.J.

825
01:11:59,671 --> 01:12:00,751
Um...

826
01:12:03,421 --> 01:12:05,336
Sorry to bug you, but...

827
01:12:05,421 --> 01:12:07,501
I guess I just wanted to talk to you.

828
01:12:07,588 --> 01:12:10,752
I have a present for you,
so I guess I'll just...

829
01:12:11,961 --> 01:12:15,212
Come by and drop it off or something, or...

830
01:12:15,297 --> 01:12:18,837
Yeah. Okay. Bye.

831
01:13:29,633 --> 01:13:30,798
Fuck you!

832
01:14:06,968 --> 01:14:08,843
Hey! You!

833
01:14:09,261 --> 01:14:10,674
The fuck do you think you're doing?

834
01:14:10,759 --> 01:14:11,884
Back the fuck up!

835
01:14:11,967 --> 01:14:13,302
- Fuck, man!
- Fuck you!

836
01:14:13,594 --> 01:14:14,634
- Chill out.
- Shut the fuck up.

837
01:14:14,719 --> 01:14:16,051
And you're a fucking whore!

838
01:14:16,136 --> 01:14:18,551
Hope you die. When you do,
no one's going to fucking notice,

839
01:14:18,635 --> 01:14:20,344
'cause you're just a fat,
fucking prostitute.

840
01:14:20,427 --> 01:14:21,843
- Dude, chill out, all right?
- Back the fuck up!

841
01:14:21,927 --> 01:14:23,925
I'll smash you in the face. I swear to God.

842
01:14:24,260 --> 01:14:26,384
I never want to see you
or your ugly fucking faces again!

843
01:14:26,469 --> 01:14:28,636
That goes for both you fucking assholes.

844
01:15:09,720 --> 01:15:11,261
Fuck you!

845
01:15:12,388 --> 01:15:14,221
I fucking hate you!

846
01:15:38,512 --> 01:15:40,679
Hey. I want to talk to you.

847
01:15:42,390 --> 01:15:43,639
Hey. Dude, I want to talk to you.

848
01:15:43,724 --> 01:15:44,679
Get your fucking hands off me.

849
01:15:44,764 --> 01:15:47,013
Dude, calm down. Calm the...

850
01:15:47,098 --> 01:15:49,221
No! Fuck! God damn it!

851
01:15:49,308 --> 01:15:50,430
I said I just want to fucking talk to you!

852
01:15:50,514 --> 01:15:51,513
Get off me!

853
01:15:51,599 --> 01:15:52,637
Calm the fuck down!

854
01:15:52,723 --> 01:15:55,139
Hey! Hey! Get off him! What are you doing?

855
01:15:55,222 --> 01:15:57,099
- Come on! Ow!
- I'll fucking cut you!

856
01:15:57,182 --> 01:15:58,345
- You...
- Fuck! No!

857
01:15:58,432 --> 01:16:00,014
- T.J.! No!
- No!

858
01:16:04,473 --> 01:16:06,724
Fuck both of you motherfuckers!

859
01:16:12,434 --> 01:16:14,891
You okay? Huh?

860
01:16:25,310 --> 01:16:26,433
T.J.?

861
01:17:24,770 --> 01:17:27,934
I actually went through 15 months of school.

862
01:17:28,476 --> 01:17:30,101
Went through their extensive training

863
01:17:30,188 --> 01:17:32,894
in mathematics, physics, chemistry.

864
01:17:32,978 --> 01:17:36,188
They train you to be the best
and expect you to be the best.

865
01:17:36,270 --> 01:17:38,103
It probably would've
cost me around...

866
01:18:33,731 --> 01:18:35,189
- Where's my car?
- What the fuck!

867
01:18:35,274 --> 01:18:36,562
- Where's the fucking car?
- Are you crazy?

868
01:18:36,648 --> 01:18:37,731
Make me ask one more time,

869
01:18:37,815 --> 01:18:38,981
your fucking toe's coming off. Where is it?

870
01:18:39,063 --> 01:18:40,355
It's gone to the wrecker's!

871
01:18:40,440 --> 01:18:41,691
Ow! Fuck!

872
01:18:41,774 --> 01:18:43,941
It's gone
to the fucking wrecking yard, fool!

873
01:18:44,025 --> 01:18:45,191
That's fucking bullshit.

874
01:18:45,273 --> 01:18:46,355
Why would I be lying?

875
01:18:46,439 --> 01:18:48,315
Because you're a fucking asshole!
Now, tell me where it is!

876
01:18:48,397 --> 01:18:50,189
It's gone to the fucking wrecking yard!

877
01:18:50,274 --> 01:18:52,354
I swear to God. Ah, fuck!

878
01:18:52,566 --> 01:18:54,233
Ow! Fuck!

879
01:18:54,316 --> 01:18:56,689
If you're lying, I'm going to cut off
every one of your fucking toes.

880
01:18:56,773 --> 01:18:58,190
You understand me?

881
01:19:00,900 --> 01:19:01,982
Yeah.

882
01:19:10,983 --> 01:19:13,524
Anything else you want
to fucking tell me? Huh?

883
01:19:13,611 --> 01:19:14,775
You want to come in my house?

884
01:19:14,860 --> 01:19:15,983
- Get the fuck off me!
- What, bitch?

885
01:19:23,568 --> 01:19:24,775
Fuck!

886
01:19:29,318 --> 01:19:30,816
Fuck! My nose!

887
01:19:31,484 --> 01:19:33,274
What the hell are you doing?

888
01:19:33,358 --> 01:19:34,776
- My nose!
- What?

889
01:19:34,860 --> 01:19:37,192
What the fuck is wrong with you?

890
01:19:38,358 --> 01:19:39,483
I just saved you.

891
01:19:39,568 --> 01:19:41,650
I told you I never want
to fucking see you again!

892
01:19:41,736 --> 01:19:43,609
How many times do I need to tell you?

893
01:19:43,694 --> 01:19:45,443
Just leave me alone!

894
01:22:16,743 --> 01:22:18,616
Come on, honey.

895
01:22:20,074 --> 01:22:21,825
Come on, sweetheart.

896
01:22:22,119 --> 01:22:23,949
What the hell is in this thing?

897
01:22:24,451 --> 01:22:26,533
Come on, guys. We got to go.

898
01:22:26,619 --> 01:22:27,783
We're going to be late.

899
01:22:27,868 --> 01:22:29,950
What about the pizza?

900
01:22:30,076 --> 01:22:31,576
You can eat it in the car.

901
01:22:31,659 --> 01:22:32,868
Cool.

902
01:22:32,953 --> 01:22:34,618
Honey, what is in here?

903
01:22:34,743 --> 01:22:36,201
You know what?

904
01:22:36,284 --> 01:22:38,076
Let's take my car. You drive.

905
01:22:46,286 --> 01:22:47,785
Can you get the door?

906
01:22:47,869 --> 01:22:48,950
Sure.

907
01:22:51,787 --> 01:22:54,328
I think we should keep
the new one and give them our old one.

908
01:22:55,162 --> 01:22:56,869
That's a great idea.

909
01:22:56,953 --> 01:22:58,036
I'll be sure to let them know

910
01:22:58,119 --> 01:23:00,117
that our old, dirty microwave
was a gift from you.

911
01:23:01,328 --> 01:23:02,495
Good.

912
01:23:02,704 --> 01:23:04,744
They don't even know who I am, anyway.

913
01:23:04,828 --> 01:23:06,578
Honey, they're my friends.

914
01:23:07,288 --> 01:23:08,495
I know.

915
01:23:09,164 --> 01:23:12,494
I just don't know why we need
to give them so many presents.

916
01:23:12,578 --> 01:23:15,451
A microwave and a bottle of scotch
is hardly a lot of presents.

917
01:23:15,786 --> 01:23:17,201
And flowers?

918
01:23:17,495 --> 01:23:19,454
- And flowers.
- And flowers.

919
01:23:19,871 --> 01:23:20,996
Mom, can you turn the radio on?

920
01:23:21,080 --> 01:23:22,205
Yeah, baby.

921
01:24:22,456 --> 01:24:23,748
Help!

922
01:24:27,875 --> 01:24:28,997
Hey!

923
01:24:32,124 --> 01:24:33,371
Hey!

924
01:24:34,123 --> 01:24:35,873
What are you doing?

925
01:24:36,625 --> 01:24:37,791
Get back. Get back.

926
01:24:39,125 --> 01:24:40,415
Get back!

927
01:24:40,791 --> 01:24:42,000
What the hell are you doing?

928
01:24:45,166 --> 01:24:46,623
I don't know.

929
01:25:48,170 --> 01:25:49,961
Where have you been?

930
01:25:51,461 --> 01:25:52,627
Sorry.

931
01:25:53,003 --> 01:25:54,793
Where have you been?

932
01:25:55,170 --> 01:25:56,460
I'm sorry.

933
01:25:56,837 --> 01:25:57,960
It's 10:00 in the morning.

934
01:25:58,961 --> 01:26:00,629
How is this fair to me?

935
01:26:01,502 --> 01:26:02,960
I don't know.

936
01:26:09,588 --> 01:26:11,171
Go to your room.

937
01:26:35,673 --> 01:26:38,129
Someone's at the front door for you.

938
01:26:53,257 --> 01:26:54,673
Hesher's not here.

939
01:26:56,881 --> 01:26:58,130
I came to see you.

940
01:27:03,047 --> 01:27:05,631
I didn't know if I should come or not.

941
01:27:06,133 --> 01:27:08,507
But I couldn't stop thinking about it.

942
01:27:09,133 --> 01:27:12,632
I thought if I came,
you'd still be angry and hate me.

943
01:27:14,299 --> 01:27:15,839
But then I thought if I didn't come,

944
01:27:15,924 --> 01:27:18,050
you'd think I didn't care
and you'd hate me anyway,

945
01:27:18,133 --> 01:27:20,798
so I figured I might as well come.

946
01:27:22,134 --> 01:27:23,882
Just in case, so...

947
01:27:25,300 --> 01:27:26,631
Here I am.

948
01:27:36,425 --> 01:27:37,675
Well, what do you want?

949
01:27:40,258 --> 01:27:42,008
I want to apologize.

950
01:27:43,800 --> 01:27:45,674
I feel bad about what happened.

951
01:27:45,966 --> 01:27:47,508
It doesn't really matter.

952
01:27:47,592 --> 01:27:48,800
It does matter.

953
01:27:49,552 --> 01:27:51,174
It matters to me.

954
01:27:52,718 --> 01:27:54,507
I really like you, T.J.

955
01:27:56,675 --> 01:27:59,927
And I understand
if you don't want to be my friend,

956
01:28:01,966 --> 01:28:04,636
but I didn't mean to hurt your feelings.

957
01:28:07,135 --> 01:28:08,383
I just...

958
01:28:10,133 --> 01:28:11,676
Sometimes, I...

959
01:28:13,635 --> 01:28:14,926
I don't know.

960
01:28:15,760 --> 01:28:18,009
But I thought I should come over
and say that,

961
01:28:18,095 --> 01:28:20,759
so you can still hate me anyway, but...

962
01:28:22,137 --> 01:28:24,469
I just thought I'd come say that.

963
01:28:24,719 --> 01:28:26,385
And now I said it.

964
01:28:28,677 --> 01:28:30,010
Okay, bye.

965
01:28:32,803 --> 01:28:34,136
Sorry I broke your lamp.

966
01:28:37,137 --> 01:28:38,136
It's okay.

967
01:28:38,929 --> 01:28:40,969
And I'm sorry I called you a fat prostitute.

968
01:28:43,262 --> 01:28:44,594
It's okay.

969
01:28:46,054 --> 01:28:47,346
You're not fat.

970
01:28:49,347 --> 01:28:51,220
But I am a prostitute?

971
01:28:52,931 --> 01:28:55,304
I don't know. Maybe.

972
01:29:57,808 --> 01:29:59,388
We are gathered here today...

973
01:29:59,473 --> 01:30:03,225
to mourn the loss
and commemorate the life...

974
01:30:03,308 --> 01:30:05,516
of Madeleine Frances Forney.

975
01:30:05,807 --> 01:30:12,098
Madeleine was a beloved wife,
mother, grandmother, and friend.

976
01:30:13,515 --> 01:30:18,849
And now Mrs. Rosowski,
a dear friend and neighbor,

977
01:30:19,141 --> 01:30:21,183
will say a few quick words.

978
01:30:36,060 --> 01:30:39,351
I did not know Madeleine long enough.

979
01:30:40,143 --> 01:30:43,016
From the moment I moved
into the neighborhood,

980
01:30:43,101 --> 01:30:46,642
she treated me
as if I was one of the family.

981
01:30:47,478 --> 01:30:50,891
She had such a kind, wonderful heart.

982
01:30:51,186 --> 01:30:54,683
We shared many wonderful walks

983
01:30:55,309 --> 01:30:58,432
and enjoyed each other's company very much.

984
01:30:58,976 --> 01:31:01,060
I will miss our walks

985
01:31:01,810 --> 01:31:03,645
and most of all, our talks.

986
01:31:04,143 --> 01:31:07,061
I will always remember what she told me.

987
01:31:07,144 --> 01:31:09,560
"Life is like walking in the rain.

988
01:31:10,435 --> 01:31:15,268
"You can... You can hide and take cover,

989
01:31:16,186 --> 01:31:19,976
"or you can just get wet".

990
01:31:36,063 --> 01:31:38,478
Okay. Thank you, Mrs. Rosowski.

991
01:31:48,521 --> 01:31:49,645
T.J.?

992
01:31:51,105 --> 01:31:53,146
I think you should say something.

993
01:31:57,147 --> 01:31:58,645
Come on, T.J.

994
01:32:22,898 --> 01:32:24,064
Sorry.

995
01:32:26,482 --> 01:32:27,855
Okay, so now at this point,

996
01:32:27,940 --> 01:32:29,146
we should conclude the service with...

997
01:32:36,232 --> 01:32:39,312
Yeah, I just want to add something
to what the kid said

998
01:32:39,397 --> 01:32:42,606
'cause I think I know
where he was going with that.

999
01:32:42,690 --> 01:32:44,774
What are you doing? Come on.

1000
01:32:44,857 --> 01:32:46,854
Sir, we have to go...

1001
01:32:46,941 --> 01:32:48,857
Don't fucking touch me.

1002
01:32:51,148 --> 01:32:53,608
Back up. Sit down.

1003
01:33:00,107 --> 01:33:01,565
I know you don't want me here,

1004
01:33:01,650 --> 01:33:03,190
I don't even want to be here, all right?

1005
01:33:03,275 --> 01:33:04,566
I didn't come here for me.

1006
01:33:04,649 --> 01:33:07,357
I fucking came here for her.

1007
01:33:09,275 --> 01:33:10,649
Now, she's been trying
to tell you guys something,

1008
01:33:10,732 --> 01:33:11,983
but you're too fucked up to listen,

1009
01:33:12,066 --> 01:33:15,025
so if you'll just shut up for a second,

1010
01:33:15,110 --> 01:33:17,441
I'm gonna say what I want to say.

1011
01:33:18,193 --> 01:33:19,651
Then you'll never see me again.

1012
01:33:37,817 --> 01:33:40,025
I pulled this gas tank from an old Chevy.

1013
01:33:40,486 --> 01:33:42,860
I wanted to blow it up, so I did.

1014
01:33:43,151 --> 01:33:46,108
What I didn't think about was all the,
you know, little bits of metal

1015
01:33:46,193 --> 01:33:48,817
that were gonna fly in every direction.

1016
01:33:48,986 --> 01:33:50,109
And I almost killed myself.

1017
01:33:50,653 --> 01:33:52,360
I woke up in this hospital.

1018
01:33:52,443 --> 01:33:54,945
And this doctor was like, "Son".

1019
01:33:55,027 --> 01:33:56,400
And I said, "Don't call me son,
you fucking cunt".

1020
01:33:56,485 --> 01:33:59,485
And then, he was, like,
"You blew off your nut".

1021
01:34:02,737 --> 01:34:04,151
I just lost my nut like that.

1022
01:34:05,237 --> 01:34:06,777
I went fucking crazy.

1023
01:34:06,861 --> 01:34:09,611
I assaulted a nurse
or a doctor, I don't remember,

1024
01:34:09,694 --> 01:34:12,236
but I got arrested, I went to juvie.

1025
01:34:12,320 --> 01:34:14,236
All I could think about
was my fucking nut, man.

1026
01:34:14,320 --> 01:34:15,985
I'm missing a nut.

1027
01:34:16,486 --> 01:34:17,861
What am I gonna do?

1028
01:34:18,987 --> 01:34:20,152
I had to go looking for it, right?

1029
01:34:20,237 --> 01:34:22,319
So I busted out of juvie
and I went searching,

1030
01:34:22,403 --> 01:34:23,486
couldn't find my nut.

1031
01:34:29,654 --> 01:34:32,820
Well, there was this one night,

1032
01:34:34,446 --> 01:34:35,986
I was sitting there
and I was taking a shit,

1033
01:34:36,155 --> 01:34:40,736
I was looking at my balls and staring
at this little piece of flabby sack...

1034
01:34:40,820 --> 01:34:42,988
where my left nut used to be.

1035
01:34:44,323 --> 01:34:47,653
And then,
I saw my right nut for the first time.

1036
01:34:49,323 --> 01:34:52,322
I was like, "Fuck, man! My nut!

1037
01:34:52,947 --> 01:34:54,947
"Look, I have... I still have a nut".

1038
01:34:55,655 --> 01:34:56,821
Right?

1039
01:34:58,739 --> 01:35:00,280
It's a good nut. It works.

1040
01:35:00,365 --> 01:35:02,447
God or the fucking devil
or whoever the fuck it is,

1041
01:35:02,530 --> 01:35:04,239
you know, he left me with one good nut.

1042
01:35:04,323 --> 01:35:06,613
I still have a fucking nut and it works,

1043
01:35:06,699 --> 01:35:08,988
and my fucking dick works, too.

1044
01:35:16,323 --> 01:35:18,323
Okay, you lost your wife.

1045
01:35:24,658 --> 01:35:26,281
And you lost your mom.

1046
01:35:32,409 --> 01:35:33,907
I lost my nut.

1047
01:35:41,951 --> 01:35:43,199
Fuck this.

1048
01:35:50,866 --> 01:35:53,324
Hey, hey! Don't fucking touch that!

1049
01:35:53,741 --> 01:35:56,697
Get your fucking hands
off the box! Go! Move!

1050
01:35:56,783 --> 01:35:57,865
Go!

1051
01:35:58,659 --> 01:36:01,450
I told Grandma that I was gonna
go on a walk with her.

1052
01:36:03,284 --> 01:36:04,658
That's what I'm gonna do.

1053
01:36:07,993 --> 01:36:09,824
You told Grandma
you were gonna go on a walk with her.

1054
01:36:10,993 --> 01:36:12,284
This is your last chance.

1055
01:38:25,833 --> 01:38:27,832
Good morning, Teej.

1056
01:38:31,624 --> 01:38:32,667
Whoa.

1057
01:38:32,749 --> 01:38:34,791
I know. It's weird, right?

1058
01:38:35,166 --> 01:38:37,664
I can feel the air on my face again.

1059
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:39,165
It looks good.

1060
01:38:40,459 --> 01:38:41,668
Thanks.

1061
01:38:42,418 --> 01:38:43,499
Hesher's gone.

1062
01:38:44,376 --> 01:38:45,541
What do you mean?

1063
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,333
I think you should come see this.
