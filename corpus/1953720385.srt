7
00:00:46,563 --> 00:00:48,440
It's pretty basic.

8
00:00:48,603 --> 00:00:51,720
Quantitative chemical analysis,
Applied Physics, -

9
00:00:51,883 --> 00:00:54,875
- Technology II,
Technical Mathematics II.

10
00:00:55,043 --> 00:00:57,921
- You skip the first semester.
- That's my boy, that.

11
00:00:58,083 --> 00:01:02,281
And  electives have you...
What did I do now that I selected?

12
00:01:02,443 --> 00:01:04,354
What about arts and crafts?

13
00:01:04,523 --> 00:01:08,402
There is a fine university,
is not a summer camp.

14
00:01:09,843 --> 00:01:12,994
Here it is.
"Integrated Design II"

15
00:01:17,403 --> 00:01:20,315
Honestly, Phil.
Now we'll make it.

16
00:01:20,483 --> 00:01:23,714
I can be calculated Jupiter landing,
so I can run uphill.

17
00:01:23,883 --> 00:01:27,080
- You've known it for months.
- It's a simple equation.

18
00:01:27,243 --> 00:01:30,633
That's why I divorced myself from your father.

19
00:01:36,403 --> 00:01:38,519
Look at this.

20
00:01:42,283 --> 00:01:45,275
Is it or Woodstock?

21
00:01:45,443 --> 00:01:48,196
My God, they're so young.

22
00:01:48,363 --> 00:01:51,116
Seven out of ten have had intercourse.

23
00:01:51,283 --> 00:01:55,037
Four out of ten use drugs.
One in ten is gay.

24
00:01:56,203 --> 00:01:58,558
What is left then?

25
00:01:59,363 --> 00:02:00,955
Me.

26
00:02:05,003 --> 00:02:08,154
Is that all you get
for $ 35,000?

27
00:02:08,323 --> 00:02:12,157
- A cell?
- It's not so bad.

28
00:02:12,323 --> 00:02:15,713
Take the furthest away from the door.
It's safer.

29
00:02:16,603 --> 00:02:19,595
I bring anything to your room.

30
00:02:20,563 --> 00:02:23,873
- To my little scout!
- Did you hit it?

31
00:02:24,043 --> 00:02:27,319
Have not been good?
I have something more.

32
00:02:28,083 --> 00:02:31,439
Some have rich parents.
You did earn it.

33
00:02:31,603 --> 00:02:34,163
But it does not have
to hang on the wall.

34
00:02:34,323 --> 00:02:37,281
Lawyers do, dentists.
Even my gynecologist.

35
00:02:37,443 --> 00:02:40,992
Then I get a receptionist
and a diary.

36
00:02:41,163 --> 00:02:43,393
- Perkins 101?
- Ja... Hey.

37
00:02:43,563 --> 00:02:46,123
- What's going on?
- My name is Aaron.

38
00:02:46,283 --> 00:02:49,081
- These are my parents.
- My name is William.

39
00:02:49,243 --> 00:02:52,440
You can call me Will or Bill
or whatever.

40
00:02:52,603 --> 00:02:55,322
Fiona here
call me Wild Bill.

41
00:02:55,483 --> 00:02:59,761
I met just her parents.
"When I take over, mother."

42
00:03:04,963 --> 00:03:08,080
It is the
we've worked for all these years.

43
00:03:08,243 --> 00:03:09,756
We?

44
00:03:09,923 --> 00:03:13,393
I should have kept up a year.
You're only 17 years old.

45
00:03:27,403 --> 00:03:30,315
I have really wrapped things up.

46
00:03:30,483 --> 00:03:32,360
What are you talking about?

47
00:03:32,523 --> 00:03:35,276
Do not make the same mistake as me.

48
00:03:41,443 --> 00:03:44,276
What error?
What are you talking about? Dad!

49
00:03:53,043 --> 00:03:55,273
Women or snopper?

50
00:03:55,443 --> 00:03:58,355
- What?
- Like chicks or snopper?

51
00:03:58,523 --> 00:04:01,993
- Women.
- Yeah. I just fucked.

52
00:04:02,163 --> 00:04:04,996
- Can you trick with the door handle?
- No.

53
00:04:05,163 --> 00:04:07,996
If you have someone with you in the room,
and will not be disturbed, -

54
00:04:08,163 --> 00:04:11,838
- so use the door handle.
Attach a tie on, you know the other -

55
00:04:12,003 --> 00:04:15,040
- that it is busy.
"Come back later."

56
00:04:15,203 --> 00:04:18,354
Can not we just
put a note on the door?

57
00:04:18,523 --> 00:04:22,880
- "It's busy., We fuck?"
- No, we could have a code.

58
00:04:23,043 --> 00:04:26,080
"Zebra Tango Niner"
or something.

59
00:04:26,243 --> 00:04:31,078
- Shit. Do I teach a virgin?
- No, I'm not a virgin.

60
00:04:31,243 --> 00:04:34,758
Do not smell the new car.
When scares you away pussy.

61
00:04:34,923 --> 00:04:39,235
- I am not a virgin!
- Okay. Do not flip out.

62
00:04:39,403 --> 00:04:42,918
Just remember the trick with the door handle.
My brother is studying at Columbia.

63
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:45,039
It works.

64
00:04:45,923 --> 00:04:47,595
Okay.

65
00:04:50,843 --> 00:04:52,720
What about this one?

66
00:04:53,683 --> 00:04:56,720
Perverse, your Scoutmaster.
I like it.

67
00:05:11,563 --> 00:05:15,397
<i> Attached is a map of </ i>
<i> female genitalia. </ I>

68
00:05:15,563 --> 00:05:19,158
<i> Please keep in mind </ i>
<i> the red area called "clitoris ". </ i>

69
00:05:19,323 --> 00:05:21,996
<i> Its location </ i>
<i> is a bit illogical, - </ i>

71
00:05:25,563 --> 00:05:29,715
<i> Had I known it a little before, </ i>
<i> could have saved my marriage. </ I>

72
00:06:05,643 --> 00:06:08,919
Is the science library on the map?

73
00:06:09,083 --> 00:06:11,358
Hi... Perkins?

74
00:06:11,523 --> 00:06:13,195
No, Aaron.

75
00:06:13,363 --> 00:06:16,912
Perkins, the Senate.
You live there, right?

76
00:06:17,083 --> 00:06:21,793
- Yes, yes. How do you know?
- I live on the same floor.

77
00:06:21,963 --> 00:06:26,878
- I saw you on the way to the shower.
- Ok...

78
00:06:27,043 --> 00:06:29,637
- My name is Darcy.
- Aaron. Hey.

79
00:06:29,803 --> 00:06:33,113
- I have already said.
- There it is.

80
00:06:33,283 --> 00:06:35,001
'll See.

81
00:06:35,963 --> 00:06:38,761
By the way...
Nice bathrobe.

82
00:06:43,683 --> 00:06:47,232
Congratulations, you have been raised
on my design seminar.

83
00:06:47,403 --> 00:06:49,963
Only the very best fit.

84
00:06:50,123 --> 00:06:53,638
See you around well.

85
00:06:53,803 --> 00:06:56,954
Most people here think
that they can walk on water.

86
00:06:57,123 --> 00:06:58,920
And you know what?

87
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:02,598
When this seminar is finished
you get the opportunity to prove it.

88
00:07:02,763 --> 00:07:07,041
Everyone must create a device as
you can walk on water in the swimming pool.

89
00:07:07,203 --> 00:07:10,320
You should design it, build it
and compete with it.

90
00:07:10,483 --> 00:07:13,759
When the semester is finished,
<i> would you like 20 year olds cope </ i>

91
00:07:13,923 --> 00:07:16,915
- as Jesus did before he was 30

92
00:07:17,083 --> 00:07:21,440
You can start by looking at
good old Archimedes...

93
00:07:26,923 --> 00:07:29,562
Why can not I change electives?

94
00:07:29,723 --> 00:07:33,318
Do you know how many students had
killed to make room on my team?

95
00:07:33,483 --> 00:07:37,192
You are the only first-year student.
You can do this here.

96
00:07:38,883 --> 00:07:43,001
It's a waste of time to drawing.
It can already.

97
00:07:43,163 --> 00:07:46,678
- How do you know?
- I was the one who got you into.

98
00:07:46,843 --> 00:07:49,960
Some of my colleagues thought
that you were too young.

99
00:07:50,123 --> 00:07:53,832
And your mother said
that you have some social problems.

100
00:07:54,003 --> 00:07:56,961
- If you want to talk about...
- Does my mom talked to you?

101
00:07:57,123 --> 00:07:59,432
- You can say it all.
- I'm good.

102
00:07:59,603 --> 00:08:03,642
- I've even gone to college.
- A drawing courses can not hurt.

103
00:08:03,803 --> 00:08:08,081
Why I chose you?
I love finding out how things work.

104
00:08:08,243 --> 00:08:12,839
And so do you.
You'll love the class.

105
00:08:25,723 --> 00:08:28,442
- Sorry.
- You're late.

106
00:08:28,603 --> 00:08:32,118
I have gone away.
I thought it was an engineer hour.

107
00:08:32,283 --> 00:08:36,071
Do you always take with you sketchbook di
to the engineer class?

108
00:08:38,803 --> 00:08:44,435
It looks like you have talent.
I want to have simple, clean lines.

109
00:08:44,603 --> 00:08:47,037
Draw what you see.

110
00:08:49,963 --> 00:08:52,921
- Sorry.
- Sit there.

111
00:08:57,443 --> 00:08:59,559
Look at it positively.

112
00:08:59,723 --> 00:09:03,432
You are certainly not flauere
than this in your whole life.

113
00:09:03,603 --> 00:09:05,958
You should just know...

114
00:09:26,603 --> 00:09:30,198
Well done, mr. Milton.
But that's not what I asked for.

115
00:09:30,363 --> 00:09:32,240
Clean and simple...

116
00:09:36,883 --> 00:09:39,317
My God, it's just so cool.

117
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:47,551
Wait, Da Vinci!

118
00:09:47,723 --> 00:09:51,352
- Why such a hurry?
- I'll have chemistry.

119
00:09:51,523 --> 00:09:56,313
I should have psychology. If we shirk
and take a caffeine drop?

120
00:09:56,483 --> 00:10:00,078
One can then not shirk first week.

121
00:10:00,243 --> 00:10:02,234
Can not?

122
00:10:13,043 --> 00:10:16,718
This is really awesome.

123
00:10:20,203 --> 00:10:21,682
Thanks.

124
00:10:24,403 --> 00:10:27,315
Okay.
Well, but... may I ask -

125
00:10:27,483 --> 00:10:30,873
- how to...
Was a freshman?

126
00:10:31,043 --> 00:10:34,160
I mean...
You're a freshman, right?

127
00:10:34,323 --> 00:10:38,475
I have been caught up as everyone
other. You thought I was favored?

128
00:10:38,643 --> 00:10:42,113
- No, but you're...
- Beautiful and talented?

129
00:10:42,283 --> 00:10:46,071
- You're just...
- Just ask then.

130
00:10:46,243 --> 00:10:47,995
Absolutely no censorship.

131
00:10:48,163 --> 00:10:50,552
Without tribe. Lighthouses loose.

132
00:10:51,603 --> 00:10:56,074
- Why do you do this?
- That's a good question. Direct.

133
00:10:56,243 --> 00:11:01,442
You have real talent.
Talented people will blurt out.

134
00:11:01,603 --> 00:11:05,152
Drop manners.
This is how you set the a question.

135
00:11:05,323 --> 00:11:09,475
"Linda, you are at least
10 years older than the rest."

136
00:11:09,643 --> 00:11:12,282
"What makes
an old chick like you here?"

137
00:11:12,443 --> 00:11:16,322
- It was not what I wanted...
- That's what you thought.

138
00:11:16,483 --> 00:11:21,511
- I thought it that way.
- Who are you trying to protect?

139
00:11:21,683 --> 00:11:24,402
Say I had three breasts -

140
00:11:24,563 --> 00:11:28,112
- think you not that I knew it
before someone said that to me?

141
00:11:28,283 --> 00:11:33,357
You are polite for your own sake.
Not mine, the trebrystede berta.

142
00:11:37,483 --> 00:11:40,714
<i> Archimedes sat in the bath </ i>
<i> when he saw the light. </ I>

143
00:11:40,883 --> 00:11:43,556
<i> Think of volume. </ I>
<i> Think of buoyancy. </ i>

144
00:11:43,723 --> 00:11:46,795
<i> You have the entire semester to build </ i>
<i> their water times. </ i>

145
00:11:46,963 --> 00:11:49,921
<i> But it is </ i>
<i> 95 percent of their character. </ i>

146
00:11:50,083 --> 00:11:55,396
- It's a tradition here at Perkins.
- Is there one that has a tape measure?

147
00:11:56,283 --> 00:11:58,638
When we use a ruler.

148
00:12:01,123 --> 00:12:03,353
Can you do this somewhere else?

149
00:12:03,523 --> 00:12:06,117
When it is your turn.
We lack only two, -

150
00:12:06,283 --> 00:12:09,480
- so we can officially appoint
Perkins' biggest dick.

151
00:12:09,643 --> 00:12:12,316
It is not the greatest,
only the longest.

152
00:12:12,483 --> 00:12:14,917
- Shut up!
- He's right.

153
00:12:15,083 --> 00:12:20,111
- We also need to measure around...
- No, you can not.

154
00:12:20,283 --> 00:12:23,241
- Then measure the circumference just one place.
- Okay sir engineer.

155
00:12:23,403 --> 00:12:25,963
How do we measure as best
our penises?

156
00:12:26,123 --> 00:12:30,355
We measure
best volume by displacement.

157
00:12:30,523 --> 00:12:32,639
Imagine a beer mug
filled with water.

158
00:12:32,803 --> 00:12:36,842
One takes the object into the mug
and measure how much water is left.

159
00:12:37,003 --> 00:12:39,358
There are only a couple of hitches to it.

160
00:12:39,523 --> 00:12:43,311
There's something about the angle of
and a beer mug.

161
00:12:43,483 --> 00:12:46,156
And who should then check it?

162
00:12:46,323 --> 00:12:49,201
I could just pour out some water.
"My dick is huge!"

163
00:12:49,363 --> 00:12:52,673
- Someone should check it out.
- Fuck volume.

164
00:12:54,163 --> 00:12:57,633
- When it's your turn, rain stick.
- No, I sit and read.

165
00:12:57,803 --> 00:13:00,522
You want us out of here

00:14:33,403 --> 00:14:36,361
Do you have dinner plans
tomorrow night?

176
00:14:36,523 --> 00:14:39,401
No...
I eat well in the cafeteria.

177
00:14:40,323 --> 00:14:43,520
Could you imagine getting
and get some real food?

178
00:14:43,683 --> 00:14:46,675
I make lasagne.
It's better than sex.

179
00:14:49,403 --> 00:14:52,600
You world.
Embarrassed You?

180
00:14:52,763 --> 00:14:54,879
No. No, then.

181
00:14:55,043 --> 00:14:59,082
I said "better than sex".
Not "prelude to sex."

182
00:15:00,003 --> 00:15:04,281
- You are the scarlet.
- Hold up.

183
00:15:06,123 --> 00:15:08,114
It goes well.

184
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:13,872
<i> Come. It is Hawaii party </ i>
<i> out by the showers. </ I>

00:15:30,643 --> 00:15:34,033
- Was not your name Darcy?
- Jo.

187
00:15:34,963 --> 00:15:36,396
Aaron?

188
00:15:38,523 --> 00:15:40,878
Nice shirt.

189
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:54,793
My God! You've mastered while
repulsion and attraction.

190
00:15:54,963 --> 00:15:57,602
- With tongue!
- In English, Aaron.

191
00:15:57,763 --> 00:16:00,675
It's impossible.

192
00:16:00,843 --> 00:16:02,993
So it's your turn.

193
00:16:06,883 --> 00:16:09,397
There must be something you can.

194
00:16:10,923 --> 00:16:15,121
- I can conjure up his roommate.
- Hail, Hell residents.

195
00:16:15,283 --> 00:16:19,242
- Who's your little delicate mimosa?
- Should it be funny?

196
00:16:19,403 --> 00:16:23,191
Is Darcy.
It's my roommate William.

197
00:16:23,363 --> 00:16:26,275
- Wild Bill. A pleasure.
- Yes, yes.

198
00:16:26,443 --> 00:16:29,719
Do not be so astringent.
You do not have so much to offer.

199
00:16:30,963 --> 00:16:33,477
- I'll see you, Aaron.
- Cheers.

200
00:16:33,643 --> 00:16:35,474
What is it with you?

201
00:16:37,523 --> 00:16:39,275
Darcy!

202
00:16:41,763 --> 00:16:44,231
I'm sorry, he's an idiot.

203
00:16:44,403 --> 00:16:47,793
Excuse. I may seem like a male chauvinist
, -

204
00:16:47,963 --> 00:16:51,433
- But if you get to know me,
I am an ok guy.

205
00:16:53,843 --> 00:16:55,674
Great.

206
00:16:55,843 --> 00:16:58,641
This here is memories.

207
00:16:58,803 --> 00:17:01,442
He is pure caveman.
Is he your friend?

208
00:17:01,603 --> 00:17:06,518
- No. roommate. Big Difference.
- How do you keep utmed him?

209
00:17:07,323 --> 00:17:10,474
I'm sorry.
He ​​has some sick ideas about girls.

210
00:17:10,643 --> 00:17:13,077
- Women, Aaron.
- I'm sorry.

211
00:17:13,243 --> 00:17:17,794
"Women" makes me think of my mother's friends
. We lack a word.

212
00:17:20,643 --> 00:17:22,998
He is wrong.

213
00:17:25,003 --> 00:17:27,563
You have plenty to offer.

214
00:17:29,043 --> 00:17:30,999
Thanks.

215
00:17:46,403 --> 00:17:50,112
- You could also have these books.
- Why are you reading that?

216
00:17:50,283 --> 00:17:52,672
One must still have...

217
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:57,517
Do not say that you have a date?

218
00:17:57,683 --> 00:18:01,153
I have not actually...
Above average.

219
00:18:08,363 --> 00:18:12,038
- Who is your secret girlfriend?
- She's gorgeous, yes!

220
00:18:12,203 --> 00:18:14,637
And old.

221
00:18:14,803 --> 00:18:16,794
And leaking.

222
00:18:16,963 --> 00:18:20,876
You never told me about
thus to be an old lady.

223
00:18:21,043 --> 00:18:24,752
Oh, that...
Yes, I am a mature student.

224
00:18:25,683 --> 00:18:29,562
Yes, yes, that makes me sound like an old
cheese.

225
00:18:29,723 --> 00:18:34,638
No, but that thing when
put to school again.

226
00:18:34,803 --> 00:18:38,876
So what did you...
When you were away from school?

227
00:18:40,003 --> 00:18:42,233
I lived only in the world.

228
00:18:42,403 --> 00:18:47,272
It was not exactly in the cards
that I should have an education, -

229
00:18:47,443 --> 00:18:50,321
- as it certainly makes for some.

230
00:18:50,483 --> 00:18:54,442
I decided not
to grow up in a pale.

231
00:19:11,603 --> 00:19:16,438
Just grab a beer.
I take a quick shower.

232
00:19:35,803 --> 00:19:39,034
- Who the hell are you?
- What?

233
00:19:39,203 --> 00:19:41,478
Who the hell are you?

234
00:19:44,883 --> 00:19:46,919
My name is Aaron.

235
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:49,756
Going on romantic dinner?

236
00:19:49,923 --> 00:19:52,118
No, just lasagne.

237
00:19:52,283 --> 00:19:55,320
Lasagne?
When it is in the box, dude.

238
00:19:55,483 --> 00:19:58,919
When Linda stock
lasagne she ends always in bed.

239
00:19:59,083 --> 00:20:03,520
- Why do we have this conversation?
- Because your fat ass is here.

240
00:20:03,683 --> 00:20:08,279
- So you can not talk to me?
- Yes, but it must be so belligerent?

241
00:20:08,443 --> 00:20:14,313
Belligerent... Where did that word,
college kid? Did you hit it?

242
00:20:14,483 --> 00:20:18,476
Linda teeth maybe
a large vocabulary -

243
00:20:18,643 --> 00:20:21,032
- but I do not light it.

244
00:20:21,203 --> 00:20:24,001
What are you?
Her daughter?

245
00:20:24,163 --> 00:20:26,996
I'm Beth. Her roommate.

246
00:20:27,163 --> 00:20:29,802
Cut out your horny bitch!

247
00:20:29,963 --> 00:20:32,955
If there is a problem,
I can just go.

248
00:20:33,123 --> 00:20:37,639
- Nice. Stitching for Christmas.
- Okay. In like manner.

249
00:20:37,803 --> 00:20:40,795
Wow, that was tame.
"In like manner"?

250
00:20:40,963 --> 00:20:45,434
I know you do not even,
but you talk too much.

251
00:20:45,603 --> 00:20:48,515
Damn you, Aaron.
Fuck you and a big, fat stick.

252
00:20:48,683 --> 00:20:51,641
Damn you, Beth.
Fuck you with the whole tree.

253
00:20:53,363 --> 00:20:56,036
So you have greeted each other?

254
00:21:01,923 --> 00:21:05,518
- You should have told you have a daughter.
- Have not I?

255
00:21:05,683 --> 00:21:08,038
No. It has not.

256
00:21:08,203 --> 00:21:12,355
She is just starting in the ninth.
And it's Cleopatra.

257
00:21:12,523 --> 00:21:15,037
They greeted each other.

258
00:21:15,963 --> 00:21:19,672
- Thanks for the wine, Aaron.
- Was the screw cap stock?

259
00:21:24,243 --> 00:21:27,792
- He damn well.
- Speak nicely, Beth.

260
00:21:27,963 --> 00:21:32,400
- Okay. He does not care.
- Ok, a little taste.

261
00:21:36,163 --> 00:21:37,721
Thanks.

262
00:21:44,723 --> 00:21:47,999
- Do not you want anything?
- Linda does not drink.

263
00:21:48,163 --> 00:21:51,200
- Did not she say that?
- Now hold it.

264
00:21:51,363 --> 00:21:53,035
Excuse.

265
00:21:53,203 --> 00:21:55,842
I did not know... Excuse me.

266
00:21:56,003 --> 00:21:59,598
Aaron, you are so polite again.
I love to have wine on the table, -

267
00:21:59,763 --> 00:22:01,913
- but not in my glass.

268
00:22:04,443 --> 00:22:08,482
Sometimes I feel that I
I fit in there.

269
00:22:09,403 --> 00:22:12,793
Thou perfect.
You are outstanding.

270
00:22:12,963 --> 00:22:16,876
- Because she is old?
- No! Look at her.

271
00:22:17,043 --> 00:22:21,639
Linda gets the other college girls
to resemble craze aunts.

272
00:22:21,803 --> 00:22:25,034
She has confidence,
she is full of life.

273
00:22:25,203 --> 00:22:28,400
Speaking always as an old man?

274
00:22:28,563 --> 00:22:33,478
- Do you think she's hot?
- She has unfortunately inherited my mouth.

275
00:22:33,643 --> 00:22:36,840
- And your exuberance.
- What the hell does it mean?

276
00:22:37,003 --> 00:22:39,836
He says you are leaking.

277
00:22:42,043 --> 00:22:44,762
- Tell me you blush?
- No.

278
00:22:46,683 --> 00:22:48,753
He does.

279
00:23:06,203 --> 00:23:10,116
- Come on. Dance with me.
- No.

280
00:23:10,283 --> 00:23:14,242
- I do not dance.
- I thought you'd never ask.

281
00:23:31,123 --> 00:23:33,353
Then it's you. Come.

282
00:23:33,523 --> 00:23:36,117
You have to.

283
00:23:45,083 --> 00:23:47,551
I should have brought sangria.

284
00:24:32,523 --> 00:24:35,515
- Come here.
- Who's on the couch?

285
00:24:41,963 --> 00:24:43,874
My God!

286
00:24:52,443 --> 00:24:55,037
Do not say I miss this...

287
00:24:58,403 --> 00:25:01,793
Cut it out.
I know you're awake.

288
00:25:03,483 --> 00:25:05,792
Can you believe this?

289
00:25:07,923 --> 00:25:11,962
- Do they do that often?
- Oh. Neighbors complain.

290
00:25:14,403 --> 00:25:17,440
- I'd better go.
- So boring you are.

291
00:25:19,963 --> 00:25:21,521
Hold up!

292
00:25:23,043 --> 00:25:25,079
What was that?

293
00:25:39,563 --> 00:25:41,952
Sleep well, moron.

294
00:25:50,723 --> 00:25:54,318
- Glad you could come...
- I'm sorry.

295
00:26:26,043 --> 00:26:30,116
- You look worn out.
- If you only knew...

296
00:26:30,283 --> 00:26:33,798
You need some home cooking
and a soft bed.

297
00:26:43,523 --> 00:26:46,674
- What are you doing?
- Put some value.

298
00:26:46,843 --> 00:26:51,075
No, do not.
We are going to jail. Do not do it!

299
00:27:03,283 --> 00:27:06,161
Are you aware
how fast you were driving?

300
00:27:06,323 --> 00:27:11,078
- Obviously not fast enough, handsome.
- I throw your ass in jail.

301
00:27:11,243 --> 00:27:15,077
You can also just
give me a round in my apartment.

302
00:27:18,323 --> 00:27:20,553
Is that him?

303
00:27:20,723 --> 00:27:22,839
He's just a kid.

304
00:27:23,003 --> 00:27:27,281
Where are your manners?
Aaron, right? My name is Wes.

305
00:27:28,523 --> 00:27:32,118
- Hello.
- I have a few clams to you.

306
00:27:33,523 --> 00:27:35,832
What the hell was that?

307
00:27:36,803 --> 00:27:38,361
Cheers.

308
00:27:39,283 --> 00:27:41,638
Sample this one.

309
00:27:44,443 --> 00:27:47,435
God.
It's gorgeous.

310
00:27:49,843 --> 00:27:52,198
So you are a police officer?

311
00:27:52,363 --> 00:27:55,594
Was it because of the
police car or uniform?

312
00:27:55,763 --> 00:27:58,596
Earth call Wes.
He ​​tries to converse.

313
00:27:58,763 --> 00:28:03,632
I do that too. What keeps you young
at university about her?

314
00:28:03,803 --> 00:28:06,556
You thought at first she was a teacher?

315
00:28:06,723 --> 00:28:11,558
None particularly note
at her. We are so different.

316
00:28:11,723 --> 00:28:14,317
Are you?
Are there similar to me?

317
00:28:14,483 --> 00:28:18,192
No way! They take
not up losers and skinheads.

318
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:21,753
- Now, do not hurt me.
- You can not be wounded.

319
00:28:21,923 --> 00:28:25,882
Do not let her treat you like a friend.

320
00:28:26,043 --> 00:28:28,352
Look.

321
00:28:28,523 --> 00:28:33,313
Do not let her get away with it.
When she starts talking about guys, -

322
00:28:33,483 --> 00:28:36,441
- so set your foot down.
You are not her friend.

323
00:28:36,603 --> 00:28:40,118
Put ​​your hands off me, you bastard!
Otherwise I blow your head off.

324
00:28:40,283 --> 00:28:43,593
- Now she fucking quit!
- Watch your language!

325
00:28:43,763 --> 00:28:46,835
Your daughter is aiming at me,
but I have to watch my language?

326
00:28:47,003 --> 00:28:49,961
- Give me the gun.
- What are you doing with it?

327
00:28:50,123 --> 00:28:53,160
Robbing a bank. Just give me the...

328
00:28:53,323 --> 00:28:56,793
- I should hide seen.
- You know what? Give me that.

329
00:28:56,963 --> 00:29:01,434
- There were bullets in this time, Wes.
- Was it?

330
00:29:01,603 --> 00:29:03,798
Do not you dare.

331
00:29:05,363 --> 00:29:07,319
Wes! For fuck!

332
00:29:07,483 --> 00:29:10,919
If she continues like this,
she ends of the cage.

333
00:29:11,083 --> 00:29:13,722
Take Aaron and buy the cakes.

334
00:29:13,883 --> 00:29:15,839
And Cigarettes!

335
00:29:16,563 --> 00:29:20,636
How old are you?
13? 14?

336
00:29:20,803 --> 00:29:24,921
- Significantly older than you.
- How do you come up to it?

337
00:29:25,083 --> 00:29:28,393
I have lived in hundeår.
Woof.

338
00:29:29,123 --> 00:29:32,798
- Hey, Ray Ray. What's going on?
- Hey, Beth. Not much.

339
00:29:32,963 --> 00:29:36,239
This is my cousin Winn.
He ​​goes on fabric.

340
00:29:36,403 --> 00:29:40,282
My uncle gives him college apparel
and hope the Straits him.

341
00:29:40,443 --> 00:29:43,480
So stupid.
Fight it, man.

342
00:29:43,643 --> 00:29:46,919
I just take one day at a time.

343
00:29:47,083 --> 00:29:50,155
Can I get a package mentolrøyk -

344
00:29:50,323 --> 00:29:53,042
- and some cream puffs?
Five or six pieces.

345
00:29:53,203 --> 00:29:55,194
Fair.

346
00:29:55,363 --> 00:29:58,639
When shall we meet?
Have a little party?

347
00:29:58,803 --> 00:30:01,192
You're too old for me.

348
00:30:18,923 --> 00:30:23,075
- Your cousin Winn?
- I just wanted to lighten the mood.

349
00:30:25,883 --> 00:30:28,716
I have some gifts for you.

350
00:30:31,163 --> 00:30:33,040
Stole from him?

351
00:30:35,883 --> 00:30:38,681
- You are totally inexperienced, what?
- What?

352
00:30:38,843 --> 00:30:41,835
- You are inexperienced, like me.
- No, I am not.

353
00:30:42,003 --> 00:30:46,315
Do not be embarrassed. I think it's sweet.
You're not like the rest of the wolves.

354
00:30:46,483 --> 00:30:50,715
You should not set limits
in my home.

355
00:30:52,043 --> 00:30:54,273
I do not want to lose her.

356
00:30:54,443 --> 00:30:57,833
It takes enough a while.
Now you're stuck with me.

357
00:30:58,723 --> 00:31:00,714
It does not matter.

358
00:31:04,923 --> 00:31:08,120
Do you...
Do you live here?

359
00:31:08,283 --> 00:31:12,720
Yeah, would not you done?
I swiped it right away.

360
00:31:25,323 --> 00:31:27,234
What are you drawing?

361
00:31:29,083 --> 00:31:30,482
You.

362
00:31:30,643 --> 00:31:34,397
Stop looking at me like that.
It scares me.

363
00:31:36,963 --> 00:31:39,352
Can I see it?

364
00:31:44,443 --> 00:31:46,559
Just find the page.

365
00:32:16,203 --> 00:32:18,000
Come on in.

366
00:32:19,483 --> 00:32:21,314
Hello.

367
00:32:21,483 --> 00:32:24,714
- I'm so...
- Come in and sit down.

368
00:32:24,883 --> 00:32:27,795
Talk to me.
I do not bite.

369
00:32:36,123 --> 00:32:40,082
- I just thought that with Wes.
- Do not worry about him.

370
00:32:40,243 --> 00:32:43,758
He does not believe in
that men and women can be friends.

371
00:32:43,923 --> 00:32:46,960
Although
are attracted to each other, so what?

372
00:32:47,123 --> 00:32:49,512
But Wes does not understand it.

373
00:32:50,883 --> 00:32:54,353
Is there an attraction here?

374
00:32:55,403 --> 00:32:57,314
Between you and me?

375
00:32:58,483 --> 00:33:03,193
Well, you are appealing in a way that
Wes never.

376
00:33:04,243 --> 00:33:06,757
You are sexy between the ears.

377
00:33:08,043 --> 00:33:10,716
Should imagine a compliment?

378
00:33:10,883 --> 00:33:13,602
That's when the worst
you could say to me.

379
00:33:13,763 --> 00:33:18,917
There is definitely a compliment.
Do you think that I'm attractive?

380
00:33:21,483 --> 00:33:24,634
Ja...
I thought it was obvious.

381
00:33:24,803 --> 00:33:28,000
I do not know.
I think I look all right.

382
00:33:28,163 --> 00:33:32,554
But in a 17-year-old eyes
I can just be like Queen Elizabeth.

383
00:33:32,723 --> 00:33:35,521
It's probably not a problem.
Trust me.

384
00:33:35,683 --> 00:33:40,711
I trust you. I tend not to invite
young guys in the bedroom.

385
00:33:40,883 --> 00:33:43,033
There is no endowment.

386
00:33:43,203 --> 00:33:46,240
It said the study office.

387
00:34:09,483 --> 00:34:13,158
We should stop here
before it becomes serious.

388
00:34:13,323 --> 00:34:16,633
We should stop.
We should stop.

389
00:34:22,403 --> 00:34:25,076
Vent. What am I doing?

390
00:34:25,243 --> 00:34:29,122
I'm so hopeless.
I will not spoil it here.

391
00:34:30,443 --> 00:34:32,877
Go. It is an order.

392
00:34:35,843 --> 00:34:37,879
Ok.

393
00:34:50,163 --> 00:34:51,881
Good night.

394
00:34:54,363 --> 00:34:57,958
<i> Do you get my messages? </ I>
<i> I have not heard from you. </ I>

395
00:34:59,883 --> 00:35:04,399
<i> Professor Van Auken says </ i>
<i> you do not come to class. </ i>

396
00:35:04,563 --> 00:35:07,680
<i> It's not like you. </ i>
<i> I'm concerned. </ i>

397
00:35:07,843 --> 00:35:10,482
<i> I want to hear from you </ i >
<i> immediately. </ i>

398
00:35:10,643 --> 00:35:12,599
<i> Is anyone there? Hello, </ i>

399
00:35:13,883 --> 00:35:15,555
<i> Aaron? </ I>

400
00:35:27,243 --> 00:35:31,156
- You can do it, Aaron.
- Yes, I just have to think about.

401
00:35:32,923 --> 00:35:37,041
There is nothing to wonder about.
Whether you can or you can not.

402
00:35:38,083 --> 00:35:40,677
That's the great thing about our discipline.

403
00:35:40,843 --> 00:35:44,279
I'm really sorry,
but fails in this way.

404
00:35:44,443 --> 00:35:47,196
I must first see it for myself.

405
00:35:48,163 --> 00:35:51,200
You do not until you have something on the blackboard.

406
00:35:57,163 --> 00:36:01,315
<i> If the equation does not work, </ i>
<i> does not water Multiplier. </ I>

407
00:36:01,483 --> 00:36:05,158
<i> We design the classroom </ i>
<i> and stock it in the laboratory. </ i>

408
00:36:05,323 --> 00:36:07,075
<i> life is about to go. </ i>

409
00:36:07,243 --> 00:36:09,837
SURFACE TENSION?
Skater?

410
00:36:11,363 --> 00:36:14,560
Skater

411
00:36:27,003 --> 00:36:28,561
Perkins?

412
00:36:28,723 --> 00:36:31,078
Hello, Perkins...

413
00:36:31,243 --> 00:36:32,961
Wake up.

414
00:36:34,243 --> 00:36:38,873
The library closes.
Shall we have a cup of coffee?

415
00:36:44,283 --> 00:36:46,513
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

416
00:36:48,443 --> 00:36:50,513
But...

417
00:36:50,683 --> 00:36:54,119
Not that it's my business,
you just have to stop me, but...

418
00:36:55,403 --> 00:36:58,918
... I've heard
that you are with a married woman.

419
00:36:59,083 --> 00:37:01,756
Really?
Have you heard?

420
00:37:01,923 --> 00:37:04,676
A married woman with children.

421
00:37:04,843 --> 00:37:08,153
I've even heard that one of them was your
, but I do not believe.

422
00:37:08,323 --> 00:37:11,315
I did not think anyone knew who I was
.

423
00:37:11,483 --> 00:37:13,713
Everyone at Perkins know.

424
00:37:13,883 --> 00:37:17,558
I'm so protagonist
in some other rumors about you.

425
00:37:18,603 --> 00:37:22,755
- I'm flattered.
- You will not tell me...

426
00:37:22,923 --> 00:37:25,801
- No. That is not true.
- What is right?

427
00:37:25,963 --> 00:37:28,477
There with the married woman.

428
00:37:29,563 --> 00:37:32,714
She has only one child.
It's not mine.

429
00:37:32,883 --> 00:37:37,240
- I have taken paternity test.
- There was then a relief.

430
00:37:38,443 --> 00:37:41,515
- Do you sleep there?
- Yes.

431
00:37:41,683 --> 00:37:45,596
It is easier.
She drives me back in the morning.

432
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:48,516
Yes, it rhymes jo...

433
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:51,197
But how do you sleep then?

434
00:38:10,763 --> 00:38:12,674
Bill will enter.

435
00:38:12,843 --> 00:38:17,598
- Who's in there? The hot mom?
- Damn! Respect handkerchief.

436
00:38:19,283 --> 00:38:22,195
Hurry!
I would enter the room.

437
00:38:26,883 --> 00:38:30,398
I do not like hair removal.
It's terrible.

438
00:38:30,563 --> 00:38:34,158
- It's okay.
- I did not ask for your approval.

439
00:38:34,323 --> 00:38:36,712
Did I say something wrong?

440
00:38:56,483 --> 00:39:00,476
Have you ever been with a natural woman?

441
00:39:00,683 --> 00:39:02,833
I do not know what that means.

442
00:39:03,003 --> 00:39:05,278
You do not have to shave, -

443
00:39:05,443 --> 00:39:08,913
- and I hope you are intelligent enough
not to expect it of me.

444
00:39:09,083 --> 00:39:13,076
- I have not thought about it.
- You certainly do not handle it?

445
00:39:13,243 --> 00:39:17,759
- What is it?
- I... We talk maybe too much.

446
00:39:17,923 --> 00:39:22,474
This Barbie doll walking, talking,
farting and underarm hair.

447
00:39:22,643 --> 00:39:27,000
If you do not like it,
, you should have taken the other model.

448
00:39:31,243 --> 00:39:33,916
Excuse !
Come, Darcy.

449
00:39:35,203 --> 00:39:38,434
Wait then. Darcy!
Come on, then!

450
00:39:38,603 --> 00:39:40,195
Damn.

451
00:39:56,283 --> 00:40:00,595
- You should buy boxer shorts.
- Take her!

452
00:40:00,763 --> 00:40:02,913
What are you doing here?

453
00:40:04,003 --> 00:40:05,994
Do not look.

454
00:40:06,763 --> 00:40:09,357
I came because...

455
00:40:10,723 --> 00:40:13,715
This here makes me absolutely crazy.

456
00:40:13,883 --> 00:40:17,193
- What?
- Not dork. Fucking her?

457
00:40:17,363 --> 00:40:19,957
- Who?
- Linda, you fool!

458
00:40:20,123 --> 00:40:23,911
Why rake it up?
You can not just come here.

459
00:40:25,603 --> 00:40:27,559
Because...

460
00:40:27,723 --> 00:40:30,283
... I love you.

461
00:40:33,043 --> 00:40:36,956
- No, you do not.
- Yes, I do.

462
00:40:37,123 --> 00:40:39,239
How can you know that?

463
00:40:39,403 --> 00:40:42,554
You have this effect on me.

464
00:40:42,723 --> 00:40:47,035
Every time you come into the room
traveling hairs on my arms.

465
00:40:47,203 --> 00:40:49,717
- As a charge.
- A charge?

466
00:40:49,883 --> 00:40:53,114
And then I totally weird in the stomach, -

467
00:40:53,283 --> 00:40:57,276
- And I have to...
It is a bit embarrassing, go to the toilet.

468
00:40:57,443 --> 00:41:00,037
- So I'm a laxative?
- Yes.

469
00:41:00,203 --> 00:41:04,196
- And what is love?
- What else you call it?

470
00:41:04,363 --> 00:41:08,993
Try to go for a walk on
pharmacy and ask for some stomach-regulating.

471
00:41:10,323 --> 00:41:13,315
I knew you would make fun of me.

472
00:41:15,083 --> 00:41:18,075
I will not hurt you,
but you're 14!

473
00:41:18,243 --> 00:41:21,952
- I do not date a 14-year-old.
- So do not date me.

474
00:41:24,003 --> 00:41:27,075
- So just lie to me.
- No, Beth!

475
00:41:27,243 --> 00:41:29,837
- You will be the first.
- No, stop.

476
00:41:30,003 --> 00:41:32,392
- You will be the first.
- Stop.

477
00:41:32,563 --> 00:41:34,952
- What are you doing?
- Go away!

478
00:41:35,123 --> 00:41:38,399
- Now What?
- You are the only one who understands me.

479
00:41:40,523 --> 00:41:44,436
- What the hell?!
- No! No! No!

480
00:41:44,603 --> 00:41:46,480
It...

481
00:41:46,643 --> 00:41:51,159
- It's not what it looks like.
- 3 to 5 years of community service?

482
00:41:51,323 --> 00:41:54,360
Hello. My name is Beth.

483
00:41:54,523 --> 00:41:57,435
- Dattera?!
- Beth, go left your jumper.

484
00:41:57,603 --> 00:42:00,071
- What was your name?
- Wild Bill.

485
00:42:00,243 --> 00:42:03,838
- Wild? Really?
- Pull back the sweater.

486
00:42:04,683 --> 00:42:07,038
Give me your keys. Come on!

487
00:42:10,523 --> 00:42:13,083
- Your roommate is a bit sweet.
- Shut up.

488
00:42:24,843 --> 00:42:28,438
Hello, beautiful.
I have on the little blue as you like, -

489
00:42:28,603 --> 00:42:32,278
- and right now they are
overflowing.

490
00:42:32,443 --> 00:42:34,001
Pardon?

491
00:42:35,363 --> 00:42:38,719
This is Susan Milton.
I will talk with my son.

492
00:42:39,963 --> 00:42:42,682
Excuse.
I thought it was...

493
00:42:42,843 --> 00:42:44,959
I want to talk to him now.

494
00:42:45,123 --> 00:42:49,674
He is not in the room right now.
Can I take a message?

495
00:42:49,843 --> 00:42:51,674
Yes. It's for you.

496
00:42:51,843 --> 00:42:55,756
I hear not of him in
a day, I hold you responsible.

497
00:42:55,923 --> 00:42:58,960
I'm with.
Will do.

498
00:42:59,123 --> 00:43:01,512
Talk. Goodbye.

499
00:43:19,843 --> 00:43:21,322
No.

500
00:43:29,883 --> 00:43:33,239
- Do you never bit easy?
- Respect handkerchief.

501
00:43:33,403 --> 00:43:35,553
It is your own words.

502
00:43:36,123 --> 00:43:38,842
Fuck handkerchief.
It is also my words.

503
00:43:39,003 --> 00:43:41,563
It should not.

504
00:43:51,403 --> 00:43:53,359
Well done, Milton!

505
00:43:53,523 --> 00:43:56,037
- You all right, mate?
- No.

506
00:43:56,203 --> 00:44:00,401
- No, I am not.
- Use me. I'm actually an expert.

507
00:44:00,563 --> 00:44:02,360
No, it's not.

508
00:44:02,523 --> 00:44:05,037
For it is not about to fuck.

509
00:44:05,203 --> 00:44:08,400
It may sound silly,
but I'm certainly in love.

510
00:44:08,563 --> 00:44:10,394
She is a child!

511
00:44:10,563 --> 00:44:15,273
- No, not her. Her mother.
- The education I'd had.

512
00:44:15,443 --> 00:44:19,561
Maybe she's sexual science
finest universities.

513
00:44:19,723 --> 00:44:22,362
Just like Yale.

514
00:44:24,043 --> 00:44:26,398
Is she interested in you?

515
00:44:26,563 --> 00:44:28,394
Yes. No.

516
00:44:29,683 --> 00:44:33,232
I do not know.
It's complicated.

517
00:44:33,403 --> 00:44:36,440
- She's in a relationship.
- A relationship?

518
00:44:36,603 --> 00:44:40,755
- With a cop.
- You're in deep water.

519
00:44:43,883 --> 00:44:48,718
Unfortunately, there is no improvement.
Very well, Mr....

520
00:44:48,883 --> 00:44:50,714
Aaron Milton.

521
00:44:50,883 --> 00:44:56,594
Writing style must be sanded a bit on,
but your arguments are outstanding.

522
00:44:56,763 --> 00:44:58,993
- But one thing worries me.
- Yes?

523
00:44:59,163 --> 00:45:01,996
You are not enrolled in the course.

524
00:45:02,683 --> 00:45:04,196
2

525
00:45:22,443 --> 00:45:26,118
Be honest.
What was wrong with my style?

526
00:45:26,283 --> 00:45:29,673
Analysis lacked depth, shades...

527
00:45:32,723 --> 00:45:35,954
What is it you like
of Greek tragedy?

528
00:45:36,123 --> 00:45:37,841
I love women.

529
00:45:38,003 --> 00:45:41,962
They are ballknusere.
They are strong and principled.

530
00:45:42,123 --> 00:45:43,761
Intense.

531
00:45:43,923 --> 00:45:48,439
Fuck with you, and she tears your heart out and leave
your friends eat there.

532
00:45:48,603 --> 00:45:53,313
But you treat her well
she gives you the planets, gods, -

533
00:45:53,483 --> 00:45:55,678
- Heaven and Earth.

534
00:45:55,843 --> 00:45:59,995
- She can change your life.
- I can hear your passion.

535
00:46:00,163 --> 00:46:03,360
But there's just not enough.
Not here.

536
00:46:04,243 --> 00:46:06,598
Give me a chance.

537
00:46:06,763 --> 00:46:10,312
I have seen this play out
again and again.

538
00:46:10,483 --> 00:46:13,919
You can not measure up with them.

539
00:46:14,083 --> 00:46:18,042
- You know me not.
- Yes, I do.

540
00:46:18,203 --> 00:46:22,082
I have a student
like you every semester.

541
00:46:23,643 --> 00:46:26,157
You know what?
Fuck you.

542
00:46:33,643 --> 00:46:38,239
Maybe it's just someone who does not
fits into a nice university.

543
00:46:41,163 --> 00:46:46,157
Who said that? A stupid professor
with a Doric column up the ass?

544
00:46:46,323 --> 00:46:48,598
Yes, that's right.

545
00:46:50,723 --> 00:46:54,193
Do not let him touch you down like that.

546
00:46:54,363 --> 00:46:57,719
It's not just him.
It's me.

547
00:46:57,883 --> 00:47:01,159
I thought it would be different here.

548
00:47:01,323 --> 00:47:04,474
Different than all the other
I have tried.

549
00:47:04,643 --> 00:47:09,922
But it's the same story over again.
Just smarter assholes.

550
00:47:10,803 --> 00:47:13,363
I'll help you hide.

551
00:47:15,523 --> 00:47:17,753
With whatever.

552
00:47:20,083 --> 00:47:22,392
You are cute.

553
00:47:26,923 --> 00:47:29,039
The last night...

554
00:47:29,203 --> 00:47:32,513
I will not talk about it.
What are you doing here?

555
00:47:34,963 --> 00:47:37,955
Can not your cousin and you
come up to me?

556
00:47:38,123 --> 00:47:41,035
I have some friends visiting.
It's so funny.

557
00:47:41,203 --> 00:47:45,037
- No, I have to do homework.
- Take them. So, I help you.

558
00:47:45,203 --> 00:47:49,037
- Will you be my tutor?
- Something like that.

559
00:47:49,203 --> 00:47:53,162
- What do you say, little man?
- It's not up to me.

560
00:47:54,563 --> 00:47:57,031
Maybe another time.

561
00:47:59,283 --> 00:48:02,878
- Thanks for the extra topping.
- Just say so.

562
00:48:05,483 --> 00:48:07,633
Why do you expose me for this?

563
00:48:07,803 --> 00:48:10,875
It is not a felony,
just a little pot.

564
00:48:11,043 --> 00:48:14,319
- Does your mother there?
- It is not her case.

565
00:48:16,123 --> 00:48:19,832
I do not think a 14-year-old to smoke pot.

566
00:48:20,563 --> 00:48:24,351
Or go with weapons.
Or have sex, for that matter.

567
00:48:24,523 --> 00:48:27,959
But it's ok to wash
mother when she has done in his pants?

568
00:48:28,123 --> 00:48:31,718
- What are you talking about?
- Bathing her, patching the lips.

569
00:48:31,883 --> 00:48:35,398
Rolling her around the page
so she gets strangled in vomiting.

570
00:48:35,563 --> 00:48:38,361
I was six or seven years.

571
00:48:38,523 --> 00:48:40,957
Can you give me a light?

572
00:48:42,883 --> 00:48:46,193
Can you now better imagine
the good old days?

573
00:48:46,363 --> 00:48:50,993
Before we moved here.
Before Linda was a model student.

574
00:48:51,163 --> 00:48:54,917
- Sorry. I did not know.
- No, you do not know Linda.

575
00:48:55,083 --> 00:48:57,643
It's not a pretty sight.

576
00:48:59,123 --> 00:49:03,116
Can not you live with your grandmother
in Jacksonville?

577
00:49:03,283 --> 00:49:05,558
At ayatollahs?

578
00:49:05,723 --> 00:49:09,033
She's quite a lady.
No thanks.

579
00:49:09,203 --> 00:49:13,196
Henne we will never return to.

580
00:49:14,683 --> 00:49:17,993
- Well... you will have a draft?
- No.

581
00:49:19,083 --> 00:49:21,153
Figured well there.

582
00:49:39,603 --> 00:49:43,994
Canceled , we tell you of something?
Driver you with a little couch gymnastics?

583
00:49:44,163 --> 00:49:47,758
Well... see something new?

584
00:49:47,923 --> 00:49:49,914
Wes...

585
00:49:50,723 --> 00:49:54,875
It's okay.
Tampen burner.

586
00:49:59,483 --> 00:50:01,394
God.

587
00:50:02,523 --> 00:50:05,276
What?! What the fuck?

588
00:50:05,443 --> 00:50:09,482
- I marry your mother.
- Maybe, Wes.

589
00:50:09,643 --> 00:50:11,793
It is not true!

590
00:50:13,003 --> 00:50:15,995
- Is that the best you can?
- Ask her.

591
00:50:16,163 --> 00:50:18,518
Is that the best you can?

592
00:50:20,403 --> 00:50:22,359
For shit.

593
00:50:22,523 --> 00:50:26,357
No, no, we've talked about it.
I'll take care of it. Relax.

594
00:50:34,243 --> 00:50:37,792
What the hell are you doing?
You can not just go up here.

595
00:50:37,963 --> 00:50:41,751
- Calm down, Beth.
- Have you learned it at a police course?

596
00:50:41,923 --> 00:50:43,800
"Calm down, Beth."

597
00:50:43,963 --> 00:50:48,195
- Do not do this to your mother.
- You can not tell me. Out!

598
00:50:49,483 --> 00:50:52,441
- Is that what you want?
- I do not know.

599
00:50:52,603 --> 00:50:55,675
I have not said yes yet.

600
00:50:56,563 --> 00:50:59,031
He insisted.

601
00:50:59,203 --> 00:51:02,639
He said I should try to see how it feels
.

602
00:51:04,203 --> 00:51:05,955
And?

603
00:51:07,803 --> 00:51:10,522
It stops blood flow.

604
00:51:11,843 --> 00:51:14,516
You never our family.

605
00:51:14,683 --> 00:51:16,401
Damn you!

606
00:51:16,563 --> 00:51:19,873
Hold Now shut up, otherwise I dry
the grin off your face.

607
00:51:20,043 --> 00:51:24,036
Are you afraid that Linda hear me?
Get lost, you piece of shit, -

608
00:51:24,203 --> 00:51:26,956
- otherwise I'm sticking out
eyes on you!

609
00:51:27,123 --> 00:51:30,035
- It was good.
- You think?

610
00:51:30,883 --> 00:51:34,193
- Stop.
- Let go of me.

611
00:51:34,363 --> 00:51:36,558
Get off me!

612
00:51:40,803 --> 00:51:43,681
Wes? Wes!
Leave her alone.

613
00:51:43,843 --> 00:51:46,755
The little bitch has provoked me long enough.

614
00:51:46,923 --> 00:51:50,598
- Wake up your hands.
- Are you kidding me? No, no...

615
00:51:53,003 --> 00:51:55,915
End!
Hold up!

616
00:51:57,203 --> 00:51:59,034
Let me.

617
00:52:01,643 --> 00:52:03,952
Oh god, Linda.

618
00:52:05,163 --> 00:52:09,042
- Get out of my house.
- You know I meant it.

619
00:52:09,203 --> 00:52:11,034
Now!

620
00:52:25,883 --> 00:52:31,674
- Thank you for driving me home.
- I would not even married.

621
00:52:31,843 --> 00:52:34,118
Why would you do that?

622
00:52:35,723 --> 00:52:40,319
- Do you plan to see him again?
- What do you think?

623
00:52:44,523 --> 00:52:48,072
- <i> Pull over. </ I>
- That's not true.

624
00:52:49,203 --> 00:52:51,717
He can go to hell.

625
00:52:55,123 --> 00:52:57,512
I do not stop, you bastard.

626
00:53:00,443 --> 00:53:03,401
- <i> Pull over now. </ I>
- Damn.

627
00:53:04,723 --> 00:53:07,874
- Slow down, Linda!
- <i> I detain you. </ I>

628
00:53:08,043 --> 00:53:10,432
You do not.

629
00:53:11,683 --> 00:53:13,560
Slow down!

630
00:53:14,323 --> 00:53:16,359
What are you doing?

631
00:53:20,483 --> 00:53:21,916
Watch out!

632
00:53:35,563 --> 00:53:36,996
Hello.

633
00:53:37,163 --> 00:53:39,518
Say that he is ok.
Is he ok?

634
00:53:39,683 --> 00:53:43,232
- How can you worry about him?
- Not Wes.

635
00:53:44,323 --> 00:53:46,075
Dog.

636
00:53:47,563 --> 00:53:51,556
See how you look.
And so are you worried about your dog?

637
00:53:52,963 --> 00:53:55,875
It ran away.
It's okay.

638
00:54:27,563 --> 00:54:30,873
- Are you okay?
- It's all my fault.

639
00:54:32,603 --> 00:54:34,673
No, it's not.

640
00:54:37,443 --> 00:54:39,559
No, it's not.

641
00:55:13,603 --> 00:55:15,036
No.

642
00:55:15,203 --> 00:55:17,876
No, it's... I can not...
Sorry.

643
00:55:18,043 --> 00:55:20,193
Do not go.

644
00:55:21,163 --> 00:55:24,155
Do not you with her?

645
00:55:24,323 --> 00:55:28,202
So stay with me.
Please?

646
00:56:26,523 --> 00:56:29,162
Structure seems solid.

647
00:56:35,203 --> 00:56:37,637
Wait, do not say anything.

648
00:56:37,803 --> 00:56:40,522
There should be a skater?

649
00:56:42,723 --> 00:56:47,160
- It looks a little strange...
- Not weirder than this.

650
00:56:48,843 --> 00:56:53,121
Aaron, this is an outstanding
subscription of English anchor time.

651
00:56:53,283 --> 00:56:56,002
Macabre, but outstanding.

652
00:56:56,163 --> 00:57:00,634
How can one with such great visions
struggle so much with the calculations?

653
00:57:02,243 --> 00:57:06,634
You came here because you have talent
. I committed a big mistake?

654
00:57:19,763 --> 00:57:23,119
I do not think he will be happy for this there.

655
00:57:24,603 --> 00:57:27,754
Is there
you take all your phones?

656
00:57:27,923 --> 00:57:32,394
- What's going on here?
- Sorry. I tried to stop them.

657
00:57:33,363 --> 00:57:37,356
What really happened?
Was she drunk? Went on drugs?

658
00:57:37,523 --> 00:57:40,401
It was an accident.
It was sake.

659
00:57:40,563 --> 00:57:43,680
I will hide
know what a 17-year-old boy-

660
00:57:43,843 --> 00:57:46,641
- make a car
with a woman in the 30s!

661
00:57:46,803 --> 00:57:50,273
- She is my friend.
- Is she your friend?

662
00:57:50,443 --> 00:57:55,119
- If that's what you want to believe...
- Dad, she is a student.

663
00:57:55,283 --> 00:57:59,754
She has helped me a lot.
You should meet her.

664
00:57:59,923 --> 00:58:04,792
- I will not pay for this!
- I have struggled to get into.

665
00:58:04,963 --> 00:58:09,639
Will you throw me out again?
Because I'm friends with a woman?

666
00:58:09,803 --> 00:58:12,237
It's crazy!

667
00:58:13,483 --> 00:58:17,112
It does not hurt to see her.

668
00:58:19,523 --> 00:58:22,162
- Are they here?
- Not yet.

669
00:58:36,603 --> 00:58:39,163
- What did you call this?
- A karryrett.

670
00:58:39,323 --> 00:58:43,680
- You've never tasted it before?
- I use curry, but not like that.

671
00:58:43,843 --> 00:58:47,233
- It's festive.
- There are Indian. Not Indian.

672
00:58:47,403 --> 00:58:50,952
I know. It is neither
maize or Indian beads i

673
00:58:51,123 --> 00:58:55,435
- I think it's lovely.
- Where did you two meet, Linda?

674
00:58:55,603 --> 00:59:00,279
- We go to the same art class.
- Is not it a bit inconvenient?

675
00:59:00,443 --> 00:59:04,231
- We have all hobbies, but...
- It is perhaps for me.

676
00:59:04,403 --> 00:59:08,794
But when you have such great talent
as your son, it is worth gold.

677
00:59:08,963 --> 00:59:14,037
What is so cool about being an engineer?
That one can sit in tjenestebil?

678
00:59:16,203 --> 00:59:20,481
- I do not think that's what they do.
- No, but he is a great artist.

679
00:59:20,643 --> 00:59:23,874
Give him a chance.
Maybe hen is the next Picasso.

680
00:59:24,043 --> 00:59:26,398
There are not many Picasso.

681
00:59:26,563 --> 00:59:29,635
And the rest starve.
It's not good enough for my son.

682
00:59:35,883 --> 00:59:38,192
Your friend Linda is...

683
00:59:39,603 --> 00:59:41,559
... A wonderful woman.

684
00:59:44,523 --> 00:59:47,674
- Oh, she's gorgeous?
- Yes.

685
00:59:48,923 --> 00:59:51,357
I think that too.

686
00:59:55,763 --> 01:00:01,156
- You got yourself some scratch, what?
- I'm much better already.

687
01:00:02,683 --> 01:00:06,073
How many accidents have there been in your life?

688
01:00:07,443 --> 01:00:09,354
Pardon?

689
01:00:09,523 --> 01:00:14,119
- Many, I believe.
- I'll go with dessert.

690
01:00:14,283 --> 01:00:17,434
The boy in there know nothing.

691
01:00:18,443 --> 01:00:21,560
You get him enough
to feel special.

692
01:00:21,723 --> 01:00:23,839
As a real casanova.

693
01:00:24,003 --> 01:00:28,440
I see right through you.
It makes enough adult men too.

694
01:00:28,603 --> 01:00:31,276
It is easier to fold over the children.

695
01:00:31,443 --> 01:00:34,241
- Now hold it.
- You are the mother.

696
01:00:34,403 --> 01:00:37,952
Let me ask you
from one mother to another...

697
01:00:38,123 --> 01:00:43,072
If you saw your baby on the way downhill
cliff, would you stop it?

698
01:00:45,163 --> 01:00:47,279
I got it.

699
01:01:28,763 --> 01:01:30,879
Now it's war.

700
01:01:38,643 --> 01:01:41,362
So, who wants to dance?

701
01:01:41,523 --> 01:01:44,560
With your neck and arm
it's probably not that smart.

702
01:01:44,723 --> 01:01:47,442
Phil, you look like a samba champion.

703
01:02:00,483 --> 01:02:02,713
Yes, stand on the Paps!

704
01:02:03,883 --> 01:02:06,681
I see that you are enjoying this.

705
01:02:23,763 --> 01:02:26,323
- No thanks.
- Tough.

706
01:02:35,843 --> 01:02:37,595
What is going on?

707
01:02:40,483 --> 01:02:43,998
- What the hell?
- This can not be happening.

708
01:02:44,163 --> 01:02:46,552
Does she have something going on with him?

709
01:02:46,723 --> 01:02:49,317
- With who?
- The old she dances with!

710
01:02:49,483 --> 01:02:52,122
- He shall receive.
- The experienced min.

711
01:02:53,643 --> 01:02:56,476
It's a long story.
What do you want?

712
01:02:56,643 --> 01:03:00,477
I will make amends.
I would still marry her.

713
01:03:00,643 --> 01:03:04,477
I would wait
to book the church.

714
01:03:09,643 --> 01:03:13,795
It's best you go.
I will say that you asked her.

715
01:03:17,563 --> 01:03:19,554
What...

716
01:03:19,723 --> 01:03:21,918
Thanks, sweet.

717
01:03:23,043 --> 01:03:25,796
What has just happened?

718
01:03:25,963 --> 01:03:28,636
Your son just asked
a cop to go.

719
01:03:28,803 --> 01:03:31,795
- Now we go.
- But we have it's funny.

720
01:03:31,963 --> 01:03:36,081
Does it look like I'm having fun?
Do not make me ask again.

721
01:03:37,123 --> 01:03:41,116
Stay away from my son,
otherwise I tear you to pieces.

722
01:03:41,283 --> 01:03:44,161
- Ask him what he wants.
- I do not care!

723
01:03:44,323 --> 01:03:46,359
I know what he needs.

724
01:03:46,523 --> 01:03:49,959
I'll show you
what he needs.

725
01:03:51,123 --> 01:03:52,681
Phil!

726
01:03:58,563 --> 01:04:03,478
Go home, Susan. Your son is cute and sexy and
have talent.

727
01:04:03,643 --> 01:04:07,431
Once you are off you go
for him, he is unstoppable.

728
01:04:07,603 --> 01:04:09,434
Now you hear anything else.

729
01:04:09,603 --> 01:04:14,518
Phil here is a delicacy.
He ​​could easily lit, -

730
01:04:14,683 --> 01:04:18,881
- if you had blood in your body
instead of coolant.

731
01:04:21,003 --> 01:04:24,040
- For God's sake, what...
- Salaam, Susan.

732
01:04:24,203 --> 01:04:27,718
It say in India
when guests visit.

733
01:04:38,603 --> 01:04:40,639
Take your coat.

734
01:04:40,803 --> 01:04:44,955
- No, I'm staying.
- You're coming home with your family.

735
01:04:48,723 --> 01:04:51,635
The  sleeves like a family to me.

736
01:04:51,803 --> 01:04:54,476
The sleeves as a family
than you are.

737
01:04:54,643 --> 01:05:00,036
Will your new family pay
university, rent and food?

738
01:05:01,363 --> 01:05:03,877
Say something to your son, then!

739
01:05:05,683 --> 01:05:08,038
Stay here.

740
01:05:08,203 --> 01:05:11,081
- I'd done.
- Asshole.

741
01:05:14,203 --> 01:05:18,594
What happened to you?
I do not know you anymore.

742
01:05:19,883 --> 01:05:21,953
No, you do not.

743
01:05:24,963 --> 01:05:26,760
Salaam, Mom.

744
01:05:47,203 --> 01:05:50,115
Sorry that we have destroyed your life.

745
01:05:53,763 --> 01:05:56,323
You are in love with her, right?

746
01:05:59,803 --> 01:06:01,794
I knew.

747
01:06:01,963 --> 01:06:05,194
My mom just run
away with everything I have.

748
01:06:06,363 --> 01:06:10,959
- I am not so romantic now.
- You kissed her back.

749
01:06:11,123 --> 01:06:14,320
- You think I'm blind?
- It was nothing.

750
01:06:15,883 --> 01:06:20,161
- I actually hurt your mother.
- Why?

751
01:06:20,323 --> 01:06:25,351
You chose the one that my mother
in front of her. It must sting.

752
01:06:38,723 --> 01:06:40,759
There he is, yes.

753
01:06:42,083 --> 01:06:43,914
Come here.

754
01:07:54,283 --> 01:07:55,921
Wes...

755
01:08:00,283 --> 01:08:02,114
Wes...

756
01:08:13,603 --> 01:08:16,675
- Aaron?
- Yes?

757
01:08:20,083 --> 01:08:23,393
Excuse...
I dreamed.

758
01:08:24,723 --> 01:08:27,157
I did too.

759
01:08:30,483 --> 01:08:32,201
Hello.

760
01:08:40,283 --> 01:08:42,114
Just tuned.

761
01:08:44,923 --> 01:08:49,678
- Wait a minute. Are you sure?
- Yes. Oh my God!

762
01:08:52,963 --> 01:08:54,635
God.

763
01:08:59,923 --> 01:09:01,754
God.

764
01:09:10,963 --> 01:09:14,751
- What? What is it?
- You have to be quiet.

765
01:09:19,003 --> 01:09:20,880
God, Wes.

766
01:09:21,043 --> 01:09:23,921
It's me, Aaron.
What are you talking about?

767
01:09:24,083 --> 01:09:26,961
Does not matter.
What is your problem?

768
01:09:31,723 --> 01:09:34,920
- Who were you in bed with?
- To hell, then.

769
01:09:40,803 --> 01:09:42,919
What have we done?

770
01:09:43,083 --> 01:09:46,837
Do nothing big deal out of this.

771
01:09:48,123 --> 01:09:52,753
We're just friends who fuck.
And it was miserable.

772
01:09:54,003 --> 01:09:56,563
Okay? Ops.

773
01:09:59,283 --> 01:10:02,878
Hold up.
I did not mean it like that.

774
01:10:03,043 --> 01:10:05,318
It did not look right.

775
01:10:06,323 --> 01:10:09,918
- Aaron...
- Hold up.

776
01:10:17,203 --> 01:10:20,912
Have you ever loved a
instead of fuck?

777
01:10:21,083 --> 01:10:26,840
For the sugar sweet...
Yes, I've loved with someone.

778
01:10:28,323 --> 01:10:32,999
- How did it feel?
- Very much like to fuck.

779
01:10:43,723 --> 01:10:46,032
Do not come back.

780
01:10:46,203 --> 01:10:49,752
Go away and never came back!
Just go!

781
01:10:49,923 --> 01:10:54,201
- Cut out, Beth.
- You got what you came for. Insert.

782
01:10:57,443 --> 01:11:02,597
- You do not know anything about.
- Linda eaten pills like candy.

783
01:11:02,763 --> 01:11:06,073
She is going down.
I have seen it before.

784
01:11:06,243 --> 01:11:08,552
You do not know shit.

785
01:11:10,363 --> 01:11:15,073
She's just pain.
I promise that she is well again in a couple of weeks.

786
01:11:15,243 --> 01:11:19,361
Do not promise anything. People are
shit bad at keeping promises.

787
01:11:19,523 --> 01:11:22,401
People do not care.

788
01:11:52,723 --> 01:11:56,352
- I come in, Bill.
- You idiot!

789
01:11:56,523 --> 01:12:00,994
Damn you! I'm tired.
I want to sleep.

790
01:12:01,163 --> 01:12:03,518
I'm finished with this!

791
01:12:23,323 --> 01:12:28,397
It was not the intention.
We just sat and talked, and then...

792
01:12:28,563 --> 01:12:32,636
- Can not you just shut up?
- We sat and talked about you.

793
01:12:32,803 --> 01:12:36,273
It was only
why she even bothered to talk to me.

794
01:12:36,443 --> 01:12:40,231
So I fuck with a
which I think is another, -

795
01:12:40,403 --> 01:12:44,237
- while fucks with a
who thinks of me.

796
01:12:44,403 --> 01:12:47,122
It's so fucked up!

797
01:12:47,283 --> 01:12:51,322
Now, are you lost?
Have you finally gotten to you?

798
01:12:51,483 --> 01:12:53,599
Was it mom?

799
01:12:54,603 --> 01:12:58,198
I did not mean your mother.
God, how did it anyway?

800
01:12:58,363 --> 01:13:02,117
Can you imagine that?

801
01:13:02,283 --> 01:13:06,117
I have no clothes, no friends
, -

802
01:13:06,283 --> 01:13:09,559
- I have no family,
and ten o'clock in the morning -

803
01:13:09,723 --> 01:13:14,080
- I will bring mathematical proof
I can walk on water.

804
01:13:14,243 --> 01:13:18,156
If I fuck it,
I can wave goodbye to the trust fund-

805
01:13:18,323 --> 01:13:21,201
- and goodbye to the university.

806
01:13:21,363 --> 01:13:26,118
- Now you need to pull yourself together.
- I do not like others say more.

807
01:13:26,283 --> 01:13:29,673
From now on, I do
I even want to.

808
01:13:30,683 --> 01:13:33,561
As soon as I know what it is.

809
01:13:42,443 --> 01:13:45,560
Well, when there came
something on the blackboard...

810
01:13:45,723 --> 01:13:48,521
Is this just a joke to you?

811
01:13:49,323 --> 01:13:51,757
It's these numbers
you are looking for.

812
01:13:51,923 --> 01:13:55,279
Not quite. Just because you give me
skater...

813
01:13:55,443 --> 01:13:57,673
I assume it's me?

814
01:13:57,843 --> 01:14:01,313
Even with skater legs
I do not get their speed.

815
01:14:01,483 --> 01:14:05,874
They turn gravity, because the
goes 100 body lengths per second.

816
01:14:06,043 --> 01:14:09,672
So one of my size have...

817
01:14:11,403 --> 01:14:14,361
... Go with 645 km per hour.

818
01:14:14,523 --> 01:14:18,232
But maybe you can move
so fast? Can you, Aaron?

819
01:14:19,003 --> 01:14:22,632
There is still hope.
You could lose 64 kg.

820
01:14:22,803 --> 01:14:25,715
How much do you weigh?

821
01:14:25,883 --> 01:14:28,795
- 66 kg.
- What?

822
01:14:28,963 --> 01:14:31,682
It is a day of competition.

823
01:14:35,803 --> 01:14:39,432
You can go. See you at the pool
tomorrow at nine.

824
01:14:52,483 --> 01:14:56,192
Hey, Aaron. </ I>
<i> Is Beth with you? </ I>

825
01:14:57,323 --> 01:15:01,475
<i> Then you must let me know. </ I>
<i> must know where she is. </ i>

826
01:15:04,043 --> 01:15:06,841
Did not she say something?

827
01:15:07,003 --> 01:15:10,996
She packed her bags and said
that I would not look for her.

828
01:15:11,163 --> 01:15:14,519
Why are you here?

829
01:15:14,683 --> 01:15:17,800
What the hell do I do?

830
01:15:17,963 --> 01:15:21,842
Call the police, the hospital!
Behave as if you care!

831
01:15:22,003 --> 01:15:26,918
Beth is much stronger than me.
She'll be fine.

832
01:15:27,083 --> 01:15:31,042
Can it?
She's 14!

833
01:15:31,203 --> 01:15:33,114
She is only 14 years.

834
01:15:33,283 --> 01:15:37,071
Has it not occurred to you
that there may have been something to her?

835
01:15:37,243 --> 01:15:40,394
That you may never
get to see her again?

836
01:15:46,723 --> 01:15:50,352
What are you doing?
It's pitiful.

837
01:16:04,803 --> 01:16:08,318
- Where is Ray Ray?
- It's his night off.

838
01:16:08,483 --> 01:16:14,479
Damn. He promised me cream puffs.
With some extra topping, you know.

839
01:16:14,643 --> 01:16:16,554
He's up there.

840
01:16:37,883 --> 01:16:40,238
Can we help you?

841
01:16:40,403 --> 01:16:43,554
I mean it.
Who the hell are you?

842
01:16:45,643 --> 01:16:48,840
Where do you think you are going?
Come here, buddy!

843
01:16:49,003 --> 01:16:51,563
Your nanny has certainly arrived.

844
01:17:01,283 --> 01:17:04,480
- Do you know how old she is?
- She knows what she's doing.

845
01:17:04,643 --> 01:17:06,998
She is 14,
half as old as you.

846
01:17:07,163 --> 01:17:12,362
And you are half as big as me.
I can crush you anyway.

847
01:17:12,523 --> 01:17:17,551
It's not just about size.
Do you know the leverage effect?

848
01:17:17,723 --> 01:17:19,600
What are you talking about?

849
01:17:26,363 --> 01:17:29,400
You are full of surprises, cousin.

850
01:17:31,763 --> 01:17:34,596
Stop! Let him go!

851
01:17:37,003 --> 01:17:40,154
- Get rid of him.
- Aaron!

852
01:17:40,323 --> 01:17:41,722
Beth!

853
01:17:49,243 --> 01:17:51,234
Have a nice evening.

854
01:18:03,403 --> 01:18:05,758
You are not true.

855
01:18:05,923 --> 01:18:08,676
What the "sting" you do not understand? "

856
01:18:08,843 --> 01:18:13,553
- Now I'll help you...
- Namely. Get lost, or in prison.

857
01:18:16,403 --> 01:18:19,156
You are fucking dead.

858
01:18:19,323 --> 01:18:20,961
What the hell?

859
01:18:21,123 --> 01:18:25,116
Stand over there with their hands in the air
the girl is out.

860
01:18:26,003 --> 01:18:28,676
You heard Batman.
Get out of my room.

861
01:18:28,843 --> 01:18:31,994
You never talk to her.
Understand?

862
01:18:33,683 --> 01:18:37,437
- Are you okay?
- See you, Beth.

863
01:18:38,563 --> 01:18:41,714
Get her downstairs,
and take care of her.

864
01:18:42,483 --> 01:18:44,280
Come here.

865
01:18:44,443 --> 01:18:47,833
What is it with you?
She's not your daughter.

866
01:18:58,443 --> 01:19:01,958
Remember those balloons
you bought for Linda?

867
01:19:02,123 --> 01:19:04,557
That "good recovery" nonsense?

868
01:19:08,443 --> 01:19:12,231
Sometimes I wonder if
if I had enough of them...

869
01:19:13,403 --> 01:19:16,600
... Then I could fly away?

870
01:19:18,283 --> 01:19:21,992
You are the engineer here.
Can it work?

871
01:19:24,643 --> 01:19:26,873
Yeah, maybe.

872
01:19:48,043 --> 01:19:50,159
I'm so sorry, Beth.

873
01:20:03,643 --> 01:20:06,362
I'm so sorry, dear.

874
01:20:39,523 --> 01:20:42,435
- Who's dead?
- Hi, Mommy. It's me.

875
01:20:42,603 --> 01:20:46,152
- Where are you? Are you ok?
- I'm fine.

876
01:20:46,323 --> 01:20:49,554
- Surprisingly enough.
- How much is it?

877
01:20:49,723 --> 01:20:52,032
<i> Is... </ i>
<i> It's pretty late. </ I>

878
01:20:52,203 --> 01:20:55,320
<i> I just wanted to say </ i>
<i> I'm ok . </ i>

879
01:20:55,483 --> 01:20:58,759
Was that why you called
?

880
01:21:00,683 --> 01:21:04,562
Quite honestly,
you can be pretty annoying.

881
01:21:04,723 --> 01:21:09,080
But you mean it quite well, and I
know you've done a lot for me.

882
01:21:09,243 --> 01:21:14,237
So I try realy
just to say thanks.

883
01:21:17,003 --> 01:21:20,552
- I'd call you.
- I know.

884
01:21:22,363 --> 01:21:25,196
That's why I called first.

885
01:21:28,403 --> 01:21:32,191
- Good night, Mom.
- Good night.

886
01:21:39,763 --> 01:21:44,041
Then there's the big day.
Are we ready? It looks like it.

887
01:21:47,923 --> 01:21:51,711
Milton.
Has anyone seen Aaron Milton?

888
01:21:56,243 --> 01:21:58,074
None?

889
01:22:00,803 --> 01:22:04,159
Okay, so get them in the water!

890
01:22:04,323 --> 01:22:07,076
Now you see what you're made of.

891
01:22:07,243 --> 01:22:09,313
On your marks...

892
01:22:14,643 --> 01:22:17,635
Are you ready, engineers?

893
01:22:17,803 --> 01:22:21,000
Let me see you
walk on water!

894
01:22:55,203 --> 01:22:57,512
Who's that over there?

895
01:23:06,483 --> 01:23:08,758
You can do this.

896
01:23:55,683 --> 01:23:58,151
You did it, Aaron.

897
01:23:58,323 --> 01:24:01,633
But it may not be quite the task
spirit.

898
01:24:01,803 --> 01:24:05,159
It did not go well with
diet.

899
01:24:35,083 --> 01:24:38,155
- Damn.
- Have not they told you?

900
01:24:56,203 --> 01:24:58,319
What is going on?

901
01:25:00,363 --> 01:25:02,558
I was going to call, but...

902
01:25:02,723 --> 01:25:06,159
I would not disturb you
middle of the competition.

903
01:25:06,323 --> 01:25:10,680
No, we must at last not.
But now that you do not disturb, -

904
01:25:10,843 --> 01:25:14,199
- so tell me why
everything is packed away.

905
01:25:14,363 --> 01:25:19,198
You were right. It's time
I become a better mother.

906
01:25:19,363 --> 01:25:22,480
I did not want you to move.

907
01:25:22,643 --> 01:25:27,512
I'm moving to Jacksonville
with Beth. We'll be staying with my mother.

908
01:25:29,043 --> 01:25:31,762
So what?
What are you going?

909
01:25:31,923 --> 01:25:35,802
- Would you flee from place to place?
- I do not know...

910
01:25:37,363 --> 01:25:40,116
But I must do something for Beth.

911
01:25:40,283 --> 01:25:43,195
I do not trust myself
right now.

912
01:25:43,363 --> 01:25:46,275
Here I have no
supporting me.

913
01:25:47,523 --> 01:25:49,514
I'm here.

914
01:25:51,083 --> 01:25:53,597
Yes, and you're swell.

915
01:25:54,483 --> 01:25:57,714
But you can not look after us.
You're 17

916
01:25:58,763 --> 01:26:02,836
You should commit your mistakes.
Do not clean up after mine.

917
01:26:06,403 --> 01:26:09,440
Have you brought with you
my favorite foods?

918
01:26:16,123 --> 01:26:18,398
You are so kind to me.

919
01:26:21,643 --> 01:26:25,602
You fought for us.
And I love you too.

920
01:26:36,763 --> 01:26:40,915
Can not you talk to Beth?
She must know that it is okay that we're leaving.

921
01:27:10,163 --> 01:27:13,758
I'll be brave
and let you go, but how?

922
01:27:17,963 --> 01:27:20,352
Take it easy, I have a plan.

923
01:27:20,523 --> 01:27:24,402
I've thought about it all night
while we packed.

924
01:27:24,563 --> 01:27:28,317
I just need to clear a couple of years,
until I'm 18

925
01:27:29,403 --> 01:27:33,794
Until then, you're an old guy
in the 20s.

926
01:27:33,963 --> 01:27:37,000
You're a hot artist
in New York -

927
01:27:37,163 --> 01:27:41,042
- surrounded by groupies and
rævslikkere.

928
01:27:41,203 --> 01:27:44,718
But it will not be enough for you.

929
01:27:46,243 --> 01:27:48,552
And then I come.

930
01:27:50,203 --> 01:27:54,799
And you will realize
what's missing in your life.

931
01:28:04,523 --> 01:28:07,640
I really would not
that you travel.

932
01:28:09,523 --> 01:28:14,916
- Promise me you will not forget me.
- People are the bad shit on promises.

933
01:28:15,963 --> 01:28:18,431
Other people. Not us.

934
01:28:26,563 --> 01:28:28,713
I promise.

935
01:28:55,843 --> 01:28:59,756
Admit it.
This is what you've wanted all along.

936
01:29:41,923 --> 01:29:44,118
Hello, Perkins.

937
01:29:45,403 --> 01:29:47,997
You have a pretty exciting life.

938
01:29:50,003 --> 01:29:53,120
Yes, it has begun
to dawn on me.

939
01:29:58,363 --> 01:30:01,514
And I've figured out your trick
cherry.

940
01:30:02,603 --> 01:30:06,232
You tie the knot
before the stalk in his mouth.

941
01:30:06,403 --> 01:30:09,998
Engineer Hours gives certain results.

942
01:30:10,163 --> 01:30:12,119
Maybe.

943
01:30:12,283 --> 01:30:15,480
I come back to you on that.

944
01:30:22,603 --> 01:30:27,393
<i> My name is Aaron Milton. </ I>
<i> whole family are engineers. </ I>

945
01:30:28,283 --> 01:30:31,878
<i> We are good to find out </ i>
<i> how things work. </ i>

946
01:30:32,043 --> 01:30:34,034
<i> Sometimes. </ i>
