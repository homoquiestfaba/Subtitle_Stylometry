<i>Like any organ does

00:00:32,452 --> 00:00:35,585

<i>Did you know that cataracts
are now responsible</i>

8
00:00:53,006 --> 00:00:56,139
<i>for 48% of world blindness?</i>

<i>Though aging is the primary
cause, there are a wide variety.</i>

10
00:01:00,648 --> 00:01:04,094
Devon, are you just going to
grade papers the whole time?

11
00:01:04,118 --> 00:01:06,051
What? This is my lunch break.

12
00:01:07,254 --> 00:01:09,987
What do you want me
to do? Pray for you.

13
00:01:10,191 --> 00:01:11,234
Your eye is fine, okay.

14
00:01:11,258 --> 00:01:15,772
Just like your teeth are not getting
looser, and you did not have foot rot.

15
00:01:15,796 --> 00:01:16,796
Knock on wood.

16
00:01:18,499 --> 00:01:19,499
Okay.

17
00:01:19,533 --> 00:01:22,733
I have to get the rest
of these papers to my TA.

18
00:01:22,937 --> 00:01:24,004
I love you.

19
00:01:25,372 --> 00:01:26,372
You are okay.

20
00:01:26,517 --> 00:01:27,517
Love you.

21
00:01:27,541 --> 00:01:28,351
Say hi to the doc for me.

22
00:01:28,375 --> 00:01:31,442
I see you after work,
assuming I can still see.

23
00:01:34,982 --> 00:01:37,049
<i>To irreversible
loss of vision.</i>

24
00:01:39,653 --> 00:01:40,653
Quinn.

25
00:01:46,204 --> 00:01:47,204
Hey there, pal.

26
00:01:47,228 --> 00:01:48,829
Hi, Dad.

27
00:01:49,831 --> 00:01:52,110
So, what is it this time?
A little redness.

28
00:01:52,134 --> 00:01:56,080
Yeah, just in the left eye. A little
dot's been there for about a week.

29
00:01:56,104 --> 00:01:57,104
Okay.

30
00:01:58,106 --> 00:02:00,439
Let us go.
Let us just lean forward.

31
00:02:01,176 --> 00:02:04,043
Place your chin on
the plastic piece there.

32
00:02:05,113 --> 00:02:07,380
Look directly into the light.

33
00:02:08,884 --> 00:02:09,884
Right here.

34
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:12,720
Good.

35
00:02:12,981 --> 00:02:14,781
By the way, your mother
made some of that...

36
00:02:14,805 --> 00:02:17,935
egg salad that you love, you
know, with the tarragon,

37
00:02:17,959 --> 00:02:19,604
I brought some in for you.

38
00:02:19,628 --> 00:02:20,628
Thanks.

39
00:02:20,762 --> 00:02:22,295
Well, what do you know?

40
00:02:22,741 --> 00:02:23,741
Pingueculitis.

41
00:02:23,765 --> 00:02:26,477
It is an irritation or a
thinning of the conjunctiva.

42
00:02:26,501 --> 00:02:28,613
It usually found
in elderly people,

43
00:02:28,637 --> 00:02:30,970
Latinos, people who
work outdoors.

44
00:02:32,374 --> 00:02:34,174
Are you the
outdoorsy type now?

45
00:02:34,209 --> 00:02:36,676
I would go with Latino
before outdoorsy.

46
00:02:36,912 --> 00:02:40,159
It could also have something
to do with your nose.

47
00:02:40,183 --> 00:02:41,326
What is wrong with my nose?

48
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:43,729
Nothing. It is a beautiful
nose, you got the Berman nose.

49
00:02:43,753 --> 00:02:47,866
Only it is slightly more pronounced
than other noses might be.

50
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:50,690
How does my nose
size contribute to this?

51
00:02:51,194 --> 00:02:52,927
It is acting as a, kind of,

52
00:02:53,362 --> 00:02:55,295
large reflector, if you will.

53
00:02:56,666 --> 00:02:58,533
My nose is so large that,

54
00:02:59,101 --> 00:03:02,414
the reflection
is burning a hole in my eye?

55
00:03:02,438 --> 00:03:03,705
No, no, no, no, no.

56
00:03:05,141 --> 00:03:06,251
Just the lining of it.

57
00:03:06,275 --> 00:03:08,542
The treatment is
artificial tears,

58
00:03:09,245 --> 00:03:11,178
and UV-protection sunglasses.

59
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:13,780
You are getting
older there, my boy.

60
00:03:14,016 --> 00:03:15,549
Twenty-eight is not old.

61
00:03:15,918 --> 00:03:16,228
Yeah.

62
00:03:16,252 --> 00:03:19,364
It is not really the age
where it makes any sense.

63
00:03:19,388 --> 00:03:20,388
Nor the race.

64
00:03:20,523 --> 00:03:23,190
All right, I will get
your UV sunglasses.

65
00:03:24,026 --> 00:03:26,026
The women are going
to love you.

66
00:03:26,362 --> 00:03:28,962
Dad, I have a girlfriend
for 10 years.

67
00:03:29,298 --> 00:03:32,699
I am kidding. I love Devon.
When are you going to propose?

68
00:03:32,869 --> 00:03:33,869
I was about to.

69
00:03:34,004 --> 00:03:35,271
I have Mama's ring.

70
00:03:35,906 --> 00:03:37,417
Now, with this illness...

71
00:03:37,441 --> 00:03:38,774
It is not an illness.

72
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:40,386
It is a condition.

73
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:42,677
It is treatable.
Marriage, I mean.

74
00:03:43,747 --> 00:03:47,560
How many times a day do I have
to put in the artificial tears?

75
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:48,228
Six or eight.

76
00:03:48,252 --> 00:03:50,530
I could just insert
some punctual plugs.

77
00:03:50,554 --> 00:03:52,887
- Insert where.
- In your punctual.

78
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:54,290
In my what?

79
00:03:54,524 --> 00:03:55,201
Tear ducts.

80
00:03:55,225 --> 00:03:57,370
Little, tiny, umbrella-shaped,
silicon plugs.

81
00:03:57,394 --> 00:04:01,341
That block out the drainage of
tears, irrigating the eye.

82
00:04:01,365 --> 00:04:01,941
I am a little...

83
00:04:01,965 --> 00:04:04,210
Sit, sit. Come on, sit
down, and sit down.

84
00:04:04,234 --> 00:04:07,167
That is it. Put your
head between your legs.

85
00:04:07,471 --> 00:04:09,538
Your grandmother
used to say...

86
00:04:11,742 --> 00:04:14,875
That means: "You only get
one first marriage."

87
00:04:15,412 --> 00:04:16,545
That is inspiring.

88
00:04:16,913 --> 00:04:17,913
Look...

89
00:04:19,383 --> 00:04:20,526
If Devon is the one,

90
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:23,229
unless there is a piece of coal in
that ring, instead of a diamond,

91
00:04:23,253 --> 00:04:26,787
your sitting on it longer,
is not doing you any good.

92
00:04:27,792 --> 00:04:30,459
You saw the people
in the waiting room.

93
00:04:30,862 --> 00:04:32,795
They were all you, yesterday.

94
00:06:41,957 --> 00:06:48,591
WE WILL NEVER HAVE PARIS
Translation and Review by Angel.

95
00:06:52,305 --> 00:06:53,305
Dev.

96
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:54,740
What?

97
00:06:55,074 --> 00:06:57,407
Are not you
supposed to be at work?

98
00:06:57,610 --> 00:06:59,677
Impersonating
late Miles Davis.

99
00:07:01,225 --> 00:07:02,225
What happened?

100
00:07:02,249 --> 00:07:04,728
No, nothing.
I wanted sir to prize...

101
00:07:04,752 --> 00:07:07,419
To precise...
I wanted to surprise you.

102
00:07:09,667 --> 00:07:10,667
Okay.

103
00:07:10,691 --> 00:07:12,869
Wait, what did he
say about your eye?

104
00:07:12,893 --> 00:07:14,093
No, it is fine.

105
00:07:14,495 --> 00:07:17,562
Actually, it put
everything into perspective.

106
00:07:19,333 --> 00:07:21,000
That well, I am finally...

107
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:25,937
You know...
I love you more than...

108
00:07:29,143 --> 00:07:30,543
Okay, I love you too.

109
00:07:32,346 --> 00:07:33,879
You are scaring me.

110
00:07:34,682 --> 00:07:37,415
Is there nothing
wrong with your eye?

111
00:07:38,262 --> 00:07:39,262
Yes, there is... No...

112
00:07:39,286 --> 00:07:41,686
Yes, there is...
It is Pingueculitis.

113
00:07:41,956 --> 00:07:45,635
It is not a big deal, I am just
supposed to wear those glasses.

114
00:07:45,659 --> 00:07:49,105
Well, you know, I do know how
seriously, you take fashion.

115
00:07:49,129 --> 00:07:51,929
Yeah, says the girl
who only wears clogs.

116
00:07:52,096 --> 00:07:53,176
What? They are comfortable.

117
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:56,268
Yeah, well, that does not make
they not clog.

118
00:07:57,105 --> 00:07:58,105
Very cloggy.

119
00:08:03,445 --> 00:08:04,445
What?

120
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,680
You are just my favorite.

121
00:08:09,851 --> 00:08:12,118
Well, you are up there
for me too.

122
00:08:12,354 --> 00:08:13,354
Well...

123
00:08:16,024 --> 00:08:17,291
The day has come...

124
00:08:18,927 --> 00:08:21,660
My God.
You got a gig playing piano.

125
00:08:22,197 --> 00:08:23,597
I...No, no, no.

126
00:08:24,666 --> 00:08:27,912
Did not you send in your demo
tape to the Thai restaurant?

127
00:08:27,936 --> 00:08:29,936
No one wants to
hear live jazz.

128
00:08:30,105 --> 00:08:32,783
While they are eating microbe,
it is too much.

129
00:08:32,807 --> 00:08:37,407
Come on, at some point you are going
to have to play in front of people.

130
00:08:38,146 --> 00:08:41,079
Anyway, I just wanted to...

131
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:43,250
I have to go.

132
00:08:44,085 --> 00:08:45,085
I have class.

133
00:08:45,287 --> 00:08:48,300
- Thank you so much for surprising me.
- Okay. Okay.

134
00:08:48,324 --> 00:08:49,268
I am going to call you
on the way home.

135
00:08:49,292 --> 00:08:52,404
I am sorry. I just supposed to
be giving a lecture on Flaubert.

136
00:08:52,428 --> 00:08:55,561
You do not have to lecture
them about Flaubert.

137
00:08:55,865 --> 00:08:57,075
Just say it nicely.

138
00:08:57,099 --> 00:08:59,432
- All right. Love you.
- Love you.

139
00:09:11,347 --> 00:09:13,280
It is just this eye condition.

140
00:09:13,683 --> 00:09:14,950
Ping... Wait. What?

141
00:09:15,785 --> 00:09:16,785
Pingueculitis.

142
00:09:17,587 --> 00:09:19,320
Is it... Is it contagious?

143
00:09:20,323 --> 00:09:21,323
No.

144
00:09:22,358 --> 00:09:25,437
What are we doing with the rose
petals? Did I miss an order?

145
00:09:25,461 --> 00:09:26,594
I am... I am...

146
00:09:28,364 --> 00:09:29,684
Okay, do not say
anything, Kelsey.

147
00:09:29,699 --> 00:09:32,232
I am going to ask
Devon to marry me.

148
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:34,680
Wow!

149
00:09:34,704 --> 00:09:37,316
You know, I used to propose to
girls in elementary school.

150
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:41,608
I mean, I was in elementary
school too. That was just legal.

151
00:09:43,447 --> 00:09:44,780
Yes! Yes!

152
00:09:47,084 --> 00:09:48,084
Yeah. Thanks.

153
00:09:52,155 --> 00:09:54,901
I mean, of course.
I called it in high school.

154
00:09:54,925 --> 00:09:58,392
You did, yeah. What about you?
You are still with...

155
00:09:59,396 --> 00:10:00,396
We broke up.

156
00:10:00,397 --> 00:10:01,541
The basketball player.

157
00:10:01,565 --> 00:10:03,232
We broke up too.

158
00:10:03,834 --> 00:10:05,367
There is a new person,

159
00:10:05,502 --> 00:10:07,569
Isaac, you will
meet him tonight.

160
00:10:08,105 --> 00:10:09,825
We are having pizza
before Jameson's, right?

161
00:10:09,849 --> 00:10:11,584
- Yes, yeah. In addition, you are bringing...
- Isaac.

162
00:10:11,608 --> 00:10:12,768
- Isaac.
- Yeah, the mechanic.

163
00:10:12,792 --> 00:10:14,754
Cool. Well, if it does not
work out with him.

164
00:10:14,778 --> 00:10:16,378
I have a great mechanic.

165
00:10:17,547 --> 00:10:18,680
- Thanks.
- Yes.

166
00:10:25,822 --> 00:10:27,889
Can I talk to you
for a second?

167
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:29,625
Sure.

168
00:10:30,027 --> 00:10:32,495
I think I might be
in love with you.

169
00:10:33,564 --> 00:10:34,564
A little.

170
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:37,100
With me?

171
00:10:38,469 --> 00:10:40,402
No, you are right. Never mind.

172
00:10:40,571 --> 00:10:41,571
No. Wait.

173
00:10:42,273 --> 00:10:43,584
- What?
- I mean...

174
00:10:43,608 --> 00:10:46,520
Obviously, I do not want to
ruin what we have here.

175
00:10:46,544 --> 00:10:47,488
I love Devon.

176
00:10:47,512 --> 00:10:49,432
She always buys me lottery
tickets on my birthday.

177
00:10:49,456 --> 00:10:51,258
Because she know how
much I want to win.

178
00:10:51,282 --> 00:10:52,615
It just hit me,

179
00:10:53,751 --> 00:10:55,084
that all these people,

180
00:10:55,386 --> 00:10:57,519
I mean, they do
not challenge me.

181
00:10:58,656 --> 00:10:59,656
You...

182
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:02,224
You make me feel like a woman.

183
00:11:03,227 --> 00:11:04,227
You listen.

184
00:11:05,697 --> 00:11:07,364
You make eye contact.

185
00:11:09,233 --> 00:11:13,566
Are you really going to marry the
first girl you have ever been with?

186
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:19,710
Well...

187
00:11:20,712 --> 00:11:21,712
One girl,

188
00:11:21,946 --> 00:11:23,279
in your entire life.

189
00:11:27,486 --> 00:11:30,019
I am sorry.
I should not have told you.

190
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:31,789
Yes, you should have.

191
00:11:31,901 --> 00:11:32,981
You can do better.

192
00:11:33,005 --> 00:11:34,325
Look at you.
You are like a model.

193
00:11:34,349 --> 00:11:38,106
I mean, when we hug, I look like
a skin tag hanging off of you.

194
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:42,500
Come on, you are a man.

195
00:11:43,001 --> 00:11:45,534
A man, what lead?
Do you believe in that?

196
00:11:48,974 --> 00:11:49,974
Sorry.

197
00:11:50,109 --> 00:11:52,509
I can get a little
rough sometimes.

198
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:56,180
Sure.

199
00:11:57,182 --> 00:11:58,182
I am too.

200
00:11:59,785 --> 00:12:01,062
I will see you tonight.

201
00:12:01,086 --> 00:12:04,019
Right. Tonight, yeah.
I will see you tonight.

202
00:12:07,726 --> 00:12:10,526
- This one?
- Yeah, that one.

203
00:12:10,929 --> 00:12:13,262
Yeah, thanks.
This is lucky seven.

204
00:12:13,298 --> 00:12:17,166
My mom got it for me, because
in my family, this is like...

205
00:12:19,139 --> 00:12:22,006
What does the tattoo
on your neck says?

206
00:12:23,276 --> 00:12:24,543
<i>"Veni, vidi, vici."</i>

207
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:27,344
"I came, I saw, I conquered."

208
00:12:29,983 --> 00:12:31,650
Is it "vici" or "Vicky"?

209
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:34,586
<i>Vici.</i>

210
00:12:34,721 --> 00:12:36,454
It is Latin, so a soft 'V'.

211
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:40,192
You got tattoos.

212
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:41,470
I? No.

213
00:12:41,494 --> 00:12:45,161
Unless you count "thug life"
scrawled across my chest.

214
00:12:45,198 --> 00:12:46,731
That is henna, so...

215
00:12:48,635 --> 00:12:50,479
No, I was just super
scared, like...

216
00:12:50,503 --> 00:12:53,716
He is going to be fine. He
freaks out about everything.

217
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:54,740
What? I do not.

218
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:56,852
Every time you sit
down at the piano.

219
00:12:56,876 --> 00:12:58,821
You mention that your
hands are shrinking.

220
00:12:58,845 --> 00:13:00,689
My hand span does
seem smaller.

221
00:13:00,713 --> 00:13:03,793
Okay, and then last week you
thought your hair was going white.

222
00:13:03,817 --> 00:13:06,750
I found all these
white hairs on my collar.

223
00:13:06,886 --> 00:13:08,097
Okay, which was cat fur?

224
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:09,655
I did not do a DNA test.

225
00:13:09,957 --> 00:13:11,134
Okay, this is so ridiculous.

226
00:13:11,158 --> 00:13:13,758
You know what I just realized,

227
00:13:13,794 --> 00:13:16,394
I have never heard
you play the piano.

228
00:13:17,097 --> 00:13:18,697
No. He does not play
in front of anybody.

229
00:13:18,699 --> 00:13:22,913
If I am going heckled, I just prefer
that it be by me that am all.

230
00:13:22,937 --> 00:13:25,182
That is cool.
I mean, it makes you

231
00:13:25,206 --> 00:13:27,473
all mysterious,
like tortured.

232
00:13:27,908 --> 00:13:29,308
See... Yes, tortured.

233
00:13:30,711 --> 00:13:32,111
That is my wheelhouse.

234
00:13:34,458 --> 00:13:35,618
Thank you so much.

235
00:13:35,642 --> 00:13:38,495
- What did you do?
- How would that happen? Dev!

236
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:39,852
Well, I am stealthy.

237
00:13:40,231 --> 00:13:41,231
Well, thank you.

238
00:13:41,255 --> 00:13:44,034
I am sorry to just
dash out on everyone.

239
00:13:44,058 --> 00:13:46,403
I think I am going
to grab a cab home.

240
00:13:46,427 --> 00:13:46,703
Why?

241
00:13:46,727 --> 00:13:50,260
I am just so tired. I have
that thing in the morning.

242
00:13:50,297 --> 00:13:52,776
Can you give these people
a ride to Jameson's?

243
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,311
Okay. Well, I love you.

244
00:13:54,335 --> 00:13:55,335
I love you.

245
00:13:55,803 --> 00:13:56,803
Bye.

246
00:13:58,539 --> 00:14:01,084
I am probably going to
head out pretty soon, too.

247
00:14:01,108 --> 00:14:02,920
I am going to go meet
up with my boys.

248
00:14:02,944 --> 00:14:03,944
Okay.

249
00:14:28,036 --> 00:14:30,636
I do not feel like
going to this party.

250
00:14:31,339 --> 00:14:33,885
All right. Why do not
I just go drop you?

251
00:14:33,909 --> 00:14:35,820
Back off with Isaac
and his boys.

252
00:14:35,844 --> 00:14:40,044
Because I do not feel like getting
stoned and playing Football.

253
00:14:42,717 --> 00:14:43,717
You philistine.

254
00:14:46,121 --> 00:14:48,388
Do not call me names.

255
00:14:50,592 --> 00:14:52,592
Did I hurt the fragile flower?

256
00:14:57,166 --> 00:14:58,166
I am sorry.

257
00:15:16,619 --> 00:15:17,619
Is that okay?

258
00:15:20,022 --> 00:15:22,155
I mean, kissing
my neck is okay.

259
00:15:22,725 --> 00:15:25,192
It is like the same
thing as hugging.

260
00:15:31,567 --> 00:15:32,567
No, no, no.

261
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:35,270
What?

262
00:15:38,574 --> 00:15:40,641
I just really
want to kiss you.

263
00:15:43,612 --> 00:15:45,545
Well, that would not be good.

264
00:15:48,418 --> 00:15:49,418
No, I know.

265
00:15:51,621 --> 00:15:53,354
I could show you my boobs.

266
00:15:55,926 --> 00:15:58,326
Okay, wait, wait.
This feels rape.

267
00:16:01,431 --> 00:16:02,431
Why?

268
00:16:02,866 --> 00:16:05,133
Because you do not
want to kiss me.

269
00:16:06,636 --> 00:16:07,636
I want to.

270
00:16:10,173 --> 00:16:11,173
I cannot.

271
00:16:15,846 --> 00:16:16,846
Yeah.

272
00:17:01,025 --> 00:17:03,558
It is not as if I could
be with Kelsey.

273
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,040
No, you could not.

274
00:17:06,064 --> 00:17:08,475
Her legs, though,
Jameson, they are so long.

275
00:17:08,499 --> 00:17:11,299
I have never seen legs
like that in person.

276
00:17:11,402 --> 00:17:13,069
They are freakishly long.

277
00:17:13,104 --> 00:17:15,249
I just... I have not been
in another relationship.

278
00:17:15,273 --> 00:17:17,540
Now this tall model likes me.

279
00:17:19,377 --> 00:17:21,244
I mean, she thinks I am sexy.

280
00:17:23,391 --> 00:17:24,391
Manly.

281
00:17:24,415 --> 00:17:27,628
Okay, she modeled one time
in a catalog for Mervyn's,

282
00:17:27,652 --> 00:17:30,185
and a lot of girls
think you are sexy.

283
00:17:30,621 --> 00:17:31,701
More than think, I am sexy.

284
00:17:31,723 --> 00:17:34,035
Okay, first off, girls
think I am cute, not sexy.

285
00:17:34,059 --> 00:17:36,459
Second, you are just
unaware of your good looks.

286
00:17:36,483 --> 00:17:40,107
I wish I were unaware of my looks,
I am aware they are not good.

287
00:17:40,232 --> 00:17:41,232
Shit.

288
00:17:41,633 --> 00:17:42,966
I just lost a grand.

289
00:17:44,069 --> 00:17:46,736
What kind of dealer
gets 21 every time?

290
00:17:47,106 --> 00:17:48,373
A computerized one.

291
00:17:48,474 --> 00:17:51,607
Maybe you do need to
explore... Wait a minute.

292
00:17:52,611 --> 00:17:54,856
I thought you wanted
to marry Devon one day.

293
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,680
I do, that is what I am saying.
It is just... Those legs...

294
00:17:59,451 --> 00:18:00,811
Dude, you really
need to chill out.

295
00:18:00,835 --> 00:18:04,065
I feel like you are about to ask
me to help you hide the body.

296
00:18:04,089 --> 00:18:06,156
I am fine, I am
thinking clearly.

297
00:18:06,258 --> 00:18:09,591
I just... I have a lot of
energy. I am galvanized.

298
00:18:10,195 --> 00:18:11,395
Check it out.

299
00:18:12,131 --> 00:18:13,131
I...

300
00:18:13,599 --> 00:18:15,132
am corning my own beef.

301
00:18:16,335 --> 00:18:18,680
Better to corn your own
than someone else's.

302
00:18:18,704 --> 00:18:22,371
I guess, okay, you are right.
I need to talk to Kelsey.

303
00:18:23,075 --> 00:18:25,209
Just patch that
up and then I...

304
00:18:25,778 --> 00:18:26,778
She is so sexy.

305
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:28,380
No, no.

306
00:18:30,416 --> 00:18:31,883
See, think of it like,

307
00:18:33,186 --> 00:18:35,731
a wet dream, right,
nothing really happened.

308
00:18:35,755 --> 00:18:38,355
So to talk about it,
would be awkward.

309
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:40,136
So what? Suppress my feelings.

310
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,537
Then, by the time,
I examine them.

311
00:18:41,561 --> 00:18:42,881
They are all tainted
and deformed,

312
00:18:42,905 --> 00:18:44,905
and then the idea of the event
and the event itself

313
00:18:44,929 --> 00:18:48,531
would become inseparable and,
therefore, impossible to analyze?

314
00:18:48,568 --> 00:18:49,712
I need to act now.

315
00:18:49,736 --> 00:18:53,215
Okay, this is not Darfur,
you do not need to act now.

316
00:18:53,239 --> 00:18:54,572
You need to go home.

317
00:18:55,041 --> 00:18:56,641
You are not making any sense.

318
00:18:59,646 --> 00:19:02,713
Imagine that was I
slapping you in the face.

319
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:04,650
That was.

320
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:18,230
Do you still learn
that same song?

321
00:19:18,265 --> 00:19:21,665
Yeah, I just cannot seem
to get past this one part.

322
00:19:24,772 --> 00:19:26,639
How was the faculty meeting?

323
00:19:28,475 --> 00:19:29,475
Hilarious.

324
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:31,543
Why are you being so cold?

325
00:19:32,279 --> 00:19:35,946
What about are you talking?
I just got back from work.

326
00:19:36,984 --> 00:19:38,094
I want to take a bath.

327
00:19:38,118 --> 00:19:39,496
We just spent the
last two hours

328
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,853
debating the plural
of: "Syllabus."

329
00:19:42,022 --> 00:19:43,022
Sorry, I...

330
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:45,490
I just wanted to
ask you something.

331
00:19:47,194 --> 00:19:49,594
Okay, can I just
run my bath first?

332
00:19:51,532 --> 00:19:52,532
Sure, fine.

333
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:02,507
I said, I wanted to
ask you something.

334
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:03,386
Okay.

335
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:06,856
You are in the bath. You
said you were going to run it,

336
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:07,880
not get in it.

337
00:20:08,049 --> 00:20:10,382
Yeah, who could have
predicted this?

338
00:20:10,619 --> 00:20:12,152
What is wrong with you?

339
00:20:12,454 --> 00:20:13,454
Nothing.

340
00:20:14,522 --> 00:20:18,389
I guess. I have just been feeling
kind of confused recently.

341
00:20:18,604 --> 00:20:19,604
About what?

342
00:20:19,628 --> 00:20:21,572
I so immerse in everything.

343
00:20:21,596 --> 00:20:23,129
I cannot... See clearly.

344
00:20:26,301 --> 00:20:29,834
Maybe, I just need to take
a step back for a moment.

345
00:20:34,509 --> 00:20:35,509
Wait a minute.

346
00:20:36,678 --> 00:20:38,155
What is happening right now?

347
00:20:38,179 --> 00:20:39,979
Nothing. I do not know. Why?

348
00:20:40,682 --> 00:20:42,349
Are you talking about us?

349
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:44,950
Not... No... I do not know...
Maybe.

350
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:48,220
Are you trying to
break up with me?

351
00:20:48,923 --> 00:20:51,723
I do not even know
what is happening to me?

352
00:20:53,695 --> 00:20:56,307
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

353
00:20:56,331 --> 00:20:58,264
I cannot fuck believe this.

354
00:20:59,701 --> 00:21:01,102
Devon, wait a second.

355
00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:02,903
- Turn around.
- What?

356
00:21:03,172 --> 00:21:04,732
Do not look at me.
I am getting dressed.

357
00:21:04,756 --> 00:21:07,819
Now, I cannot see you naked.
Ten seconds ago, it was fine.

358
00:21:07,843 --> 00:21:10,622
Yeah, well, a lot happened
in the last 10 seconds.

359
00:21:10,646 --> 00:21:13,025
Nothing has happened.
You are overreacting.

360
00:21:13,049 --> 00:21:16,049
I do not even know
what I am saying right now.

361
00:21:17,887 --> 00:21:18,887
Who is it?

362
00:21:19,121 --> 00:21:21,266
- Who is what?
- It is always someone else.

363
00:21:21,290 --> 00:21:24,303
What? The only girls I know
are you and Kelsey.

364
00:21:24,327 --> 00:21:27,527
I am with you, Kelsey
is like a model...

365
00:21:28,408 --> 00:21:29,408
Wow!

366
00:21:29,432 --> 00:21:32,632
I did not mean that.
I do hear how that sounded.

367
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:36,003
Devon, what are you doing?

368
00:21:36,305 --> 00:21:37,572
Do you like Kelsey?

369
00:21:38,207 --> 00:21:39,207
I do... No.

370
00:21:40,176 --> 00:21:41,176
Not like that.

371
00:21:42,778 --> 00:21:43,778
I swear.

372
00:21:43,946 --> 00:21:46,258
Wait... You did nothing
there is that.

373
00:21:46,282 --> 00:21:48,082
My head is just spinning...

374
00:21:48,451 --> 00:21:50,495
Maybe I need to gain
some sort of perspective,

375
00:21:50,519 --> 00:21:54,387
or objectivity for a second
before... What are you doing?

376
00:21:54,758 --> 00:21:55,758
Do not touch me.

377
00:21:55,926 --> 00:21:57,870
I am going to stay
somewhere else tonight.

378
00:21:57,894 --> 00:22:00,227
Look, if you do not
want to see me.

379
00:22:00,364 --> 00:22:01,631
I can go somewhere.

380
00:22:02,466 --> 00:22:04,399
No, I am going, you stay here.

381
00:22:05,235 --> 00:22:06,279
Where are you going to go?

382
00:22:06,303 --> 00:22:07,463
I do not know, to my parents.

383
00:22:07,487 --> 00:22:09,582
With wet hair?
You will get pneumonia.

384
00:22:09,606 --> 00:22:10,606
Please.

385
00:22:12,008 --> 00:22:13,208
- Fuck.
- I know.

386
00:22:13,877 --> 00:22:15,677
No. Thought I lost a piece.

387
00:22:17,114 --> 00:22:21,114
Maybe you are not ready
to get married, dude, I mean,

388
00:22:21,151 --> 00:22:24,364
obviously, your brain is
trying to tell you something.

389
00:22:24,388 --> 00:22:26,121
No, I want to marry Devon.

390
00:22:27,557 --> 00:22:31,624
I think. I have just been so
comfortable with her for so long.

391
00:22:31,828 --> 00:22:32,828
I cannot tell.

392
00:22:33,563 --> 00:22:36,296
It is easier to feel
when you are in pain.

393
00:22:38,145 --> 00:22:39,145
I guess I just

394
00:22:39,169 --> 00:22:43,036
fear that I have been confusing
complacency with happiness.

395
00:22:45,276 --> 00:22:48,743
I am already 28, it is just
going to start flying by.

396
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:50,624
I want to feel like a man.

397
00:22:50,648 --> 00:22:54,648
I want to experience crazy
romance, pining, and jealousy.

398
00:22:56,421 --> 00:22:58,966
And whirlwind affairs
in foreign countries.

399
00:22:58,990 --> 00:23:00,190
Check it out.

400
00:23:01,893 --> 00:23:03,560
It is a Middle Eastern man

401
00:23:04,962 --> 00:23:05,962
on the camel.

402
00:23:08,499 --> 00:23:09,566
They make those.

403
00:23:09,801 --> 00:23:12,668
I did have to special
order it, but, yeah.

404
00:23:14,338 --> 00:23:15,871
Okay, I have to go now.

405
00:23:21,979 --> 00:23:22,979
Are you doing all right?

406
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:24,358
No, I just explained that,

407
00:23:24,382 --> 00:23:27,060
while you were building
a scene from Aladdin.

408
00:23:27,084 --> 00:23:28,884
No. Look, I am here for you.

409
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,120
Okay, thank you, I need to go.

410
00:23:31,989 --> 00:23:33,389
- Home?
- Yes, home.

411
00:23:33,424 --> 00:23:34,601
- No proposing?
- None.

412
00:23:34,625 --> 00:23:35,892
- No Kelsey.
- No.

413
00:23:36,127 --> 00:23:37,839
I hope I was able to help.

414
00:23:37,863 --> 00:23:38,863
Yeah.

415
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:43,233
Are you thinking about Devon?

416
00:23:45,537 --> 00:23:47,470
I do not even feel bad though.

417
00:23:48,707 --> 00:23:50,174
Maybe I am a sociopath.

418
00:23:52,845 --> 00:23:55,178
I guess we allowed
kissing now.

419
00:23:56,448 --> 00:23:57,781
That is so romantic.

420
00:24:22,007 --> 00:24:25,207
Do you think maybe?
We should get ready for bed.

421
00:24:27,656 --> 00:24:28,656
Yeah.

422
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:30,548
I mean, I am ready but okay.

423
00:24:33,553 --> 00:24:34,553
Okay.

424
00:25:05,084 --> 00:25:08,197
I do not really know how to ramp
up to where we were before.

425
00:25:08,221 --> 00:25:09,732
Do you want to talk to me?

426
00:25:09,756 --> 00:25:10,889
Sure. About what?

427
00:25:11,624 --> 00:25:12,624
No, like dirty.

428
00:25:14,394 --> 00:25:17,973
I am good. I do not really
have anything to say dirtily.

429
00:25:17,997 --> 00:25:20,930
Why? Did you
want me to talk to you?

430
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,268
No. No, I mean,
if you wanted to.

431
00:25:23,671 --> 00:25:25,448
Do you want to
talk to me like that?

432
00:25:25,472 --> 00:25:27,805
Sure. Yeah, that could be fun.

433
00:25:27,975 --> 00:25:29,442
Okay. Yeah. Go for it.

434
00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:32,255
Whenever you are ready,
take your time.

435
00:25:32,279 --> 00:25:33,946
Let me just set the mood.

436
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:40,820
Okay, so...

437
00:25:43,123 --> 00:25:44,390
Take out your cock.

438
00:25:44,491 --> 00:25:46,091
I have not put it in yet.

439
00:25:46,126 --> 00:25:48,059
No, not out of... Never mind.

440
00:25:48,095 --> 00:25:49,828
Okay, yes. Yes, ma'am.

441
00:25:50,831 --> 00:25:53,443
Do you want me to address
you as something?

442
00:25:53,467 --> 00:25:54,867
No. This is not that.

443
00:25:56,203 --> 00:25:57,213
You know, forget it.

444
00:25:57,237 --> 00:25:59,370
No, I am taking out my cock.

445
00:26:01,986 --> 00:26:02,986
Okay.

446
00:26:03,010 --> 00:26:05,210
Give me that thing.

447
00:26:06,981 --> 00:26:08,981
- What?
- Nothing. I am sorry.

448
00:26:10,184 --> 00:26:12,451
Your hand is cold.

449
00:26:20,595 --> 00:26:24,995
That feels so good, Kelsey.
Keep going.

450
00:26:25,133 --> 00:26:26,693
Thanks, Quinn.

451
00:26:26,717 --> 00:26:28,579
Yeah, that does feel good.
Keep going.

452
00:26:28,603 --> 00:26:31,916
Do it faster, Kelsey. Do it.

453
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:33,184
Whatever you say, Quinn.

454
00:26:33,208 --> 00:26:35,386
Sorry, this is making me
a little uncomfortable.

455
00:26:35,410 --> 00:26:38,456
I feel like I am in a
threesome with two of me.

456
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,480
Wait.

457
00:26:40,258 --> 00:26:41,258
What?

458
00:26:41,282 --> 00:26:43,394
Because my hand feels too good
on your cock.

459
00:26:43,418 --> 00:26:45,951
I do not think I
am going to last.

460
00:26:46,054 --> 00:26:47,898
Why because it feels too good?

461
00:26:47,922 --> 00:26:49,189
Yes, it feels good.

462
00:26:57,465 --> 00:27:00,411
Sorry, I did not
make it, Kelsey.

463
00:27:00,435 --> 00:27:03,247
That is okay. I am flattered.

464
00:27:03,271 --> 00:27:05,004
Who are you? What is that?

465
00:27:20,056 --> 00:27:21,189
- Hi.
- Hi.

466
00:27:22,091 --> 00:27:23,691
The toilet is broken.

467
00:27:24,794 --> 00:27:27,861
I hope you can wait
to go to the bathroom.

468
00:27:28,798 --> 00:27:29,798
Sure.

469
00:27:29,999 --> 00:27:34,399
I was thinking that maybe we could
get brunch and go to the beach.

470
00:27:37,807 --> 00:27:40,318
- What do you think?
- The beach.

471
00:27:40,342 --> 00:27:41,987
They still have sand
at those things.

472
00:27:42,011 --> 00:27:45,757
Because I always found that to
be the one flaw with beaches.

473
00:27:45,781 --> 00:27:46,848
Come on. Get up.

474
00:27:50,986 --> 00:27:52,319
Okay, you get ready,

475
00:27:52,955 --> 00:27:56,622
I... Before we go, I have
to stop at my proprietor's.

476
00:27:57,626 --> 00:27:59,960
Because I lost my
checkbook again.

477
00:28:01,164 --> 00:28:02,497
The toilet is...

478
00:28:04,034 --> 00:28:05,034
Okay.

479
00:28:18,782 --> 00:28:19,782
What is this?

480
00:28:20,717 --> 00:28:22,117
It is a face scrubber.

481
00:28:23,186 --> 00:28:25,586
It is for Edward James Olmos.
Jesus!

482
00:28:26,823 --> 00:28:29,756
My God! Perhaps
a sacrificial offering.

483
00:28:32,929 --> 00:28:34,662
You building a pipe organ?

484
00:28:37,033 --> 00:28:38,700
You like my new lipstick.

485
00:28:42,806 --> 00:28:44,339
It called creamsicle.

486
00:30:03,188 --> 00:30:06,321
What is wrong? Is it
something with the toilet?

487
00:30:09,561 --> 00:30:11,228
Quinn? Are you okay, boo?

488
00:30:13,565 --> 00:30:14,565
"Boo"?

489
00:30:14,733 --> 00:30:15,733
Yeah.

490
00:30:15,801 --> 00:30:16,934
I cannot, I cannot.

491
00:30:18,036 --> 00:30:21,036
- You cannot what.
- I cannot go to the beach.

492
00:30:22,541 --> 00:30:23,741
I do not feel well.

493
00:30:25,611 --> 00:30:26,621
What do you want?

494
00:30:26,645 --> 00:30:29,178
I want to go home.
I need to go rest.

495
00:30:33,452 --> 00:30:34,452
Okay.

496
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:35,820
Are you angry?

497
00:30:37,957 --> 00:30:38,957
Yeah, a little.

498
00:30:39,893 --> 00:30:40,893
Kel, I am sorry.

499
00:30:41,094 --> 00:30:43,561
I just need to go
home for a minute.

500
00:30:47,967 --> 00:30:48,967
Okay.

501
00:30:49,435 --> 00:30:50,435
I am sorry.

502
00:31:03,483 --> 00:31:04,483
No.

503
00:31:09,689 --> 00:31:10,689
My God.

504
00:31:13,493 --> 00:31:15,437
Please, God, forgive me.
I am sorry.

505
00:31:15,461 --> 00:31:18,994
Help me live with this guilt,
help me get past it.

506
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:22,745
I think I had to do
this with Kelsey,

507
00:31:22,769 --> 00:31:25,302
to better my
relationship with Devon.

508
00:31:26,673 --> 00:31:27,673
Amen.

509
00:31:51,398 --> 00:31:52,398
You. Wait.

510
00:31:54,034 --> 00:31:55,034
My bush!

511
00:31:55,336 --> 00:31:56,603
It is for love, man.

512
00:31:56,971 --> 00:31:58,104
Crime of passion.

513
00:31:58,739 --> 00:31:59,939
What a lucky girl.

514
00:32:22,297 --> 00:32:23,430
Devon.

515
00:32:25,333 --> 00:32:27,333
What? What are you doing here?

516
00:32:28,303 --> 00:32:29,770
Are your parents here?

517
00:32:29,838 --> 00:32:30,838
No.

518
00:32:37,946 --> 00:32:38,946
My God!

519
00:32:40,148 --> 00:32:43,548
I picked this flower
from that angry man's garden.

520
00:32:52,394 --> 00:32:54,261
Did you come from somewhere?

521
00:32:56,364 --> 00:32:57,897
Did you come from 1973?

522
00:33:00,335 --> 00:33:03,002
No. I just wanted to
look nice for you.

523
00:33:06,875 --> 00:33:09,875
You have bearing a
rose that you picked.

524
00:33:12,981 --> 00:33:15,315
What do you think?
I am a florist.

525
00:33:22,258 --> 00:33:23,791
You started smoking.

526
00:33:24,794 --> 00:33:26,727
Starting is the hardest part.

527
00:33:31,967 --> 00:33:34,367
What made you
decide to do this?

528
00:33:35,004 --> 00:33:37,404
I realized that I
could not run away,

529
00:33:39,842 --> 00:33:41,775
from you and everything else.

530
00:33:43,212 --> 00:33:45,612
The problem existed
somewhere in me,

531
00:33:47,850 --> 00:33:49,917
my fears of moving forward.

532
00:33:56,959 --> 00:34:00,359
You are not feeling curious
about other people.

533
00:34:01,897 --> 00:34:03,697
I was, maybe. I do not know.

534
00:34:05,501 --> 00:34:08,369
I think it was just
that moment, you know,

535
00:34:09,339 --> 00:34:12,006
when you either turn
away or go deeper.

536
00:34:16,046 --> 00:34:17,046
Yeah.

537
00:34:23,153 --> 00:34:25,753
I did think I had
feelings for Kelsey.

538
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:31,027
Yeah, I knew it.

539
00:34:33,396 --> 00:34:34,729
Did anything happen?

540
00:34:34,965 --> 00:34:35,965
No.

541
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:41,733
We kissed last night, and then we
did a couple other things too.

542
00:34:51,248 --> 00:34:52,692
Did you sleep with her?

543
00:34:52,716 --> 00:34:53,716
No.

544
00:34:55,118 --> 00:34:56,118
It was stupid,

545
00:34:58,188 --> 00:35:00,922
I am just happy that
it is over and...

546
00:35:01,225 --> 00:35:05,758
I mean, it will be a little uncomfortable
with her at work now but...

547
00:35:06,731 --> 00:35:07,998
Are you kidding me?

548
00:35:09,277 --> 00:35:10,277
What?

549
00:35:10,301 --> 00:35:12,701
You are going to keep
working with her?

550
00:35:14,505 --> 00:35:17,772
I need a job, and honestly,
she is just a friend.

551
00:35:18,743 --> 00:35:21,210
You are a fucking
we are a silly fuck!

552
00:35:23,147 --> 00:35:24,147
- What?
- No!

553
00:35:26,484 --> 00:35:28,262
Is everything all right?

554
00:35:28,286 --> 00:35:29,846
It is fine, Kurt.
Can you just, please...?

555
00:35:29,870 --> 00:35:32,699
You did not tell me your brother was
home. I tried calling you, man...

556
00:35:32,723 --> 00:35:36,003
He is my brother. You do not
get to call him right now.

557
00:35:36,027 --> 00:35:37,838
Do you know what?
You are right.

558
00:35:37,862 --> 00:35:41,595
We have problems that we need
to figure out separately.

559
00:35:41,699 --> 00:35:43,832
- You are not ready.
- No. Wait.

560
00:35:44,368 --> 00:35:46,448
Maybe you should
go be with other girls.

561
00:35:46,472 --> 00:35:48,982
Otherwise, it is always
going to be plaguing you.

562
00:35:49,006 --> 00:35:50,073
I am not plagued.

563
00:35:50,446 --> 00:35:51,686
Besides, what
girls would I...?

564
00:35:51,710 --> 00:35:55,843
I am sorry. Let me go and find
some girls for you to fuck.

565
00:35:56,081 --> 00:35:57,458
Devon that is not
what I meant.

566
00:35:57,482 --> 00:36:00,349
- I just do not know anybody.
- Just leave.

567
00:36:04,990 --> 00:36:08,523
So now, you have to go bone
a bunch of other girls.

568
00:36:09,872 --> 00:36:10,872
I guess.

569
00:36:10,896 --> 00:36:13,029
Devon is all right with this.

570
00:36:13,098 --> 00:36:15,165
She told me I had to.

571
00:36:16,435 --> 00:36:18,435
Kelsey keeps calling, texting.

572
00:36:19,238 --> 00:36:20,315
See. You are magnetic.

573
00:36:20,339 --> 00:36:23,939
Okay, so I will do that with
the boning. Take a moment.

574
00:36:24,209 --> 00:36:27,188
Then I will see what the deal
is with Devon. I do not know.

575
00:36:27,212 --> 00:36:30,812
I mean, right now, I have
to get it out of my system,

576
00:36:33,018 --> 00:36:34,018
like a poison.

577
00:36:35,487 --> 00:36:36,487
Very romantic.

578
00:36:37,256 --> 00:36:38,800
It is not supposed
to be romantic.

579
00:36:38,824 --> 00:36:41,691
I need to be a person,
a guy who fucks girls.

580
00:36:44,697 --> 00:36:46,230
I need to fucking fuck.

581
00:36:47,467 --> 00:36:50,879
I still do not think you should
be with anybody right now.

582
00:36:50,903 --> 00:36:52,743
Maybe we should have
a party here or something.

583
00:36:52,767 --> 00:36:56,352
No. My parents are coming back from
the Dutch house in a couple months.

584
00:36:56,376 --> 00:36:59,321
A couple months...
I am not looking to remodel.

585
00:36:59,345 --> 00:37:02,878
Look, you just need to
clear your head for a moment.

586
00:37:04,217 --> 00:37:07,217
Why do not we go somewhere?
Like out of town.

587
00:37:08,288 --> 00:37:09,955
We will forget about girls.

588
00:37:11,224 --> 00:37:13,957
Yes, thank you.
That is what I am saying.

589
00:37:14,727 --> 00:37:17,127
Great! Yeah, we will
just go be guys.

590
00:37:18,031 --> 00:37:19,698
We will go be fucking people.

591
00:37:20,243 --> 00:37:21,243
Yes.

592
00:37:21,267 --> 00:37:23,667
This is Fresh Air.
I am Terry Gross.

593
00:37:23,947 --> 00:37:24,947
The fear of ticks

594
00:37:24,971 --> 00:37:28,150
is taking some of the pleasure
out of walking in the woods...

595
00:37:28,174 --> 00:37:30,574
You ever send a
check to them NPR.

596
00:37:31,544 --> 00:37:32,811
Yeah, all the time.

597
00:37:33,746 --> 00:37:35,213
Yeah, I have to do that.

598
00:37:35,281 --> 00:37:36,921
See, those are the kind
of things, you know.

599
00:37:36,945 --> 00:37:41,345
When you are in a relationship,
that just get swept under the rug.

600
00:39:17,285 --> 00:39:18,285
I miss Devon.

601
00:39:18,296 --> 00:39:19,296
- No.
- Yes, dude.

602
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:21,933
I think I got it out of my
system, you know, with this

603
00:39:21,957 --> 00:39:24,824
and the surrey and
the weird little horse.

604
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:25,804
Dude, you have to take time.

605
00:39:25,828 --> 00:39:27,572
You know, her brother
will not call me back.

606
00:39:27,596 --> 00:39:29,608
- What? You called Kurt.
- Here you go.

607
00:39:29,632 --> 00:39:31,376
I left him a couple
messages just saying,

608
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:33,120
I hope we can still
hang out and be friends.

609
00:39:33,144 --> 00:39:35,113
- Dude, his is her brother.
- But he is my friend.

610
00:39:35,137 --> 00:39:37,649
- And it has been, like, two days.
- Preemptive.

611
00:39:37,673 --> 00:39:39,406
My God. Quinn, listen.

612
00:39:39,642 --> 00:39:43,909
You really have to chill out, you
maniac. You have to be alone.

613
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:45,980
Do not see anybody.

614
00:39:46,549 --> 00:39:48,149
Just take a deep breath.

615
00:39:49,819 --> 00:39:51,352
And enjoy this freedom.

616
00:40:12,107 --> 00:40:13,107
What do I do?

617
00:40:16,546 --> 00:40:17,746
What do people do?

618
00:40:29,092 --> 00:40:30,092
Single.

619
00:40:36,533 --> 00:40:38,533
Pennsylvania, ranch, family...

620
00:40:42,873 --> 00:40:43,873
Beach.

621
00:40:44,708 --> 00:40:45,708
Okay.

622
00:40:52,582 --> 00:40:53,582
All right.

623
00:40:59,656 --> 00:41:00,656
All right.

624
00:41:26,817 --> 00:41:27,817
Shit!

625
00:41:37,628 --> 00:41:38,628
- Quinn.
- Hi.

626
00:41:39,764 --> 00:41:40,764
- Hi.
- Hey.

627
00:41:44,068 --> 00:41:45,201
Pull up a saddle.

628
00:41:47,271 --> 00:41:48,271
Howdy.

629
00:41:50,975 --> 00:41:54,288
The last time I was in a saddle
was on a horse at summer camp.

630
00:41:54,312 --> 00:41:58,159
I had an anxiety attack and
woke up in the cantor's office.

631
00:41:58,183 --> 00:41:59,250
No pun intended.

632
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:02,320
Cantor...

633
00:42:04,923 --> 00:42:09,070
See, if they would just put an
Ethiopian restaurant in Ethiopia,

634
00:42:09,094 --> 00:42:11,361
it would solve a
lot of problems.

635
00:42:17,069 --> 00:42:18,336
Sorry, I am nervous.

636
00:42:18,670 --> 00:42:19,937
Yeah. I am now too.

637
00:42:24,209 --> 00:42:25,676
So do you like the beach?

638
00:42:27,012 --> 00:42:28,012
The beach?

639
00:42:29,615 --> 00:42:31,148
Yeah, well, I saw on...

640
00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:35,319
On what?

641
00:42:36,521 --> 00:42:37,521
I saw on...

642
00:42:40,926 --> 00:42:41,926
On Facebook.

643
00:42:42,694 --> 00:42:45,707
Did I, like, write that
somewhere or something?

644
00:42:45,731 --> 00:42:46,731
No, no.

645
00:42:49,001 --> 00:42:51,614
- Do you know what you are getting?
- No.

646
00:42:51,638 --> 00:42:52,638
Sorry.

647
00:42:53,239 --> 00:42:54,906
I did not follow you here.

648
00:42:56,209 --> 00:42:57,609
I just need a moment.

649
00:42:58,144 --> 00:42:59,144
Kelsey.

650
00:42:59,646 --> 00:43:02,846
This is not me. I do not
do these kind of things.

651
00:43:04,217 --> 00:43:05,350
Sorry. This is...

652
00:43:06,052 --> 00:43:07,963
I am the girl Quinn
left his girlfriend for.

653
00:43:07,987 --> 00:43:11,800
And you must be the girl he left his
girlfriend for the second time,

654
00:43:11,824 --> 00:43:14,291
after he left me for
his girlfriend.

655
00:43:15,261 --> 00:43:16,261
No. Excuse me.

656
00:43:18,331 --> 00:43:21,477
What is going on? How did
you know I would be here?

657
00:43:21,501 --> 00:43:22,444
Facebook.

658
00:43:22,468 --> 00:43:24,079
That was a private message.

659
00:43:24,103 --> 00:43:25,914
You are so non-savvy
with computers.

660
00:43:25,938 --> 00:43:27,583
My ineptitude does
not make this okay.

661
00:43:27,607 --> 00:43:29,885
Look, I have been thinking, and
I think you made a mistake.

662
00:43:29,909 --> 00:43:33,822
I mean, that we made a mistake because
this is not rotten at the core,

663
00:43:33,846 --> 00:43:37,046
like there were symptoms of
something gone awry

664
00:43:37,417 --> 00:43:38,884
that we were ignoring.

665
00:43:38,951 --> 00:43:40,829
I think that if we
were just honest...

666
00:43:40,853 --> 00:43:41,730
Kelsey, wait. Calm down.

667
00:43:41,754 --> 00:43:43,900
I am just trying to
cool off for a moment.

668
00:43:43,924 --> 00:43:46,457
I do not want to see
anyone right now.

669
00:43:49,329 --> 00:43:51,596
She is nobody.
I am not seeing her.

670
00:43:54,234 --> 00:43:56,913
Maybe you need to get
your eyes checked again,

671
00:43:56,937 --> 00:43:59,270
because I see the
fuck out of her.

672
00:44:00,974 --> 00:44:02,307
You need to grow up.

673
00:44:14,354 --> 00:44:15,354
I am sorry.

674
00:44:16,557 --> 00:44:18,557
I do not even
know what to say.

675
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:21,560
You can leave now.

676
00:44:22,062 --> 00:44:23,729
I am not this kind of person,

677
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:27,200
juggling women.

678
00:44:36,010 --> 00:44:37,010
Okay.

679
00:44:37,912 --> 00:44:39,912
I think it is out
of my system.

680
00:44:42,383 --> 00:44:43,383
What?

681
00:44:44,152 --> 00:44:45,152
What?

682
00:44:45,754 --> 00:44:47,487
What is out of your system?

683
00:44:48,289 --> 00:44:50,089
What about are you talking?

684
00:44:50,358 --> 00:44:53,158
You just said this is
out of your system.

685
00:44:53,495 --> 00:44:55,295
What is out of your system?

686
00:44:57,832 --> 00:45:01,165
You are a pint-sized
narcissist.

687
00:45:01,836 --> 00:45:04,436
And I could barely
feel you inside me.

688
00:45:07,475 --> 00:45:09,553
You sure you got it out
of your system?

689
00:45:09,577 --> 00:45:12,310
It was never in my
system to begin with.

690
00:45:14,349 --> 00:45:15,349
Try this.

691
00:45:19,053 --> 00:45:22,253
I quit my job this morning
which is a big step.

692
00:45:23,858 --> 00:45:25,925
Yeah, you made a
pledge to NPR,

693
00:45:26,094 --> 00:45:29,241
you went on one date,
now you are unemployed.

694
00:45:29,265 --> 00:45:31,265
I would call that
personal growth.

695
00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:32,900
Yes. I have matured.

696
00:45:35,404 --> 00:45:37,004
You sure you want Devon?

697
00:45:37,773 --> 00:45:39,640
That is all I
have ever wanted.

698
00:45:41,777 --> 00:45:43,110
Cheers to that, man.

699
00:45:43,245 --> 00:45:46,178
And it has been good
having you around again.

700
00:45:48,184 --> 00:45:49,184
Cheers, man.

701
00:45:56,025 --> 00:45:57,358
It is spicy.

702
00:45:57,459 --> 00:45:59,871
No, it is good...
Good spice, it is painful.

703
00:45:59,895 --> 00:46:04,009
I call it the Oaxaca dirty bomb.
It is pleasant though, right?

704
00:46:04,033 --> 00:46:05,443
Just like the name suggests.

705
00:46:05,467 --> 00:46:06,867
It made with real
Habanero chilies,

706
00:46:06,891 --> 00:46:08,346
that I cultivated
hydroponically.

707
00:46:08,370 --> 00:46:10,237
I am going to go
get Devon back.

708
00:46:10,873 --> 00:46:12,340
What about your drink?

709
00:46:23,053 --> 00:46:24,653
Hi, Jean. Is Devon here?

710
00:46:28,024 --> 00:46:29,024
No.

711
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:30,960
Okay.

712
00:46:34,731 --> 00:46:35,731
Is Devon here?

713
00:46:38,435 --> 00:46:39,435
No.

714
00:46:42,082 --> 00:46:43,082
Is she here though?

715
00:46:43,106 --> 00:46:45,117
What the fucks are
you doing, Quinn?

716
00:46:45,141 --> 00:46:46,608
This is not Anne Frank.

717
00:46:47,277 --> 00:46:49,544
She is not here.
What do you want?

718
00:46:52,315 --> 00:46:54,115
I want to be back with her.

719
00:46:56,052 --> 00:46:57,052
I was an idiot.

720
00:46:59,089 --> 00:47:01,089
I know it now, and I need her.

721
00:47:04,661 --> 00:47:05,861
I am falling apart.

722
00:47:07,998 --> 00:47:08,998
Hey, man.

723
00:47:15,806 --> 00:47:18,185
Quinn, I thought
when I saw you again,

724
00:47:18,209 --> 00:47:22,142
I would slap you until you had
to have your jaw wired shut.

725
00:47:23,558 --> 00:47:24,558
But I look at you now...

726
00:47:24,582 --> 00:47:27,982
and you are like a poor,
pathetic, wounded gazelle.

727
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:30,320
Thank you.

728
00:47:31,656 --> 00:47:32,656
She is gone.

729
00:47:33,557 --> 00:47:35,624
- Devon?
- She left last week.

730
00:47:37,061 --> 00:47:38,261
- Where?
- Paris.

731
00:47:39,497 --> 00:47:40,897
We have family there.

732
00:47:41,209 --> 00:47:42,209
She got a place.

733
00:47:42,233 --> 00:47:46,413
She is going to take a semester off
from the university, find herself.

734
00:47:46,437 --> 00:47:48,970
Well, how long is
she going to be there?

735
00:47:51,342 --> 00:47:53,675
I cannot get in the
middle of this.

736
00:48:05,557 --> 00:48:06,557
Hello.

737
00:48:07,025 --> 00:48:08,025
Hi.

738
00:48:09,928 --> 00:48:13,528
I am so sorry that I showed up
at the Ethiopian place.

739
00:48:15,133 --> 00:48:16,133
No. It is fine.

740
00:48:17,746 --> 00:48:18,746
What are you doing?

741
00:48:18,770 --> 00:48:22,970
Honestly, trying to figure out
Devon's exact location in Paris.

742
00:48:25,143 --> 00:48:26,743
<i>So I can chase her down.</i>

743
00:48:26,812 --> 00:48:29,123
<i>Well, did not she send flowers
through the shop</i>

744
00:48:29,147 --> 00:48:31,326
<i>to her, like,
grandparents in France?</i>

745
00:48:31,350 --> 00:48:33,928
<i>Their address is
probably in the database.</i>

746
00:48:33,952 --> 00:48:37,619
She is not staying with them.
They do not speak English.

747
00:48:37,923 --> 00:48:42,656
Well, I really just wanted to say I
was sorry for being a total idiot.

748
00:48:42,871 --> 00:48:43,871
No.

749
00:48:43,895 --> 00:48:48,428
Sometimes the healthiest thing we
can do is make a fool of ourselves.

750
00:48:58,911 --> 00:48:59,911
Yes, Quinn.

751
00:48:59,946 --> 00:49:01,546
- Hi. Kurt.
- Hey.

752
00:49:01,825 --> 00:49:03,185
Listen, I want to
send her flowers.

753
00:49:03,209 --> 00:49:06,876
A housewarming gift. You got
to let me do that. Please.

754
00:49:07,487 --> 00:49:08,597
I am an ex-florist, okay.

755
00:49:08,621 --> 00:49:11,633
I know what flowers she wants,
what she needs.

756
00:49:11,657 --> 00:49:16,057
Can I just have her address? I mean,
come on, what am I going to do?

757
00:50:40,247 --> 00:50:41,247
What?

758
00:50:41,482 --> 00:50:43,350
Quinn. My God! You are...

759
00:50:44,652 --> 00:50:45,652
You are here.

760
00:50:47,622 --> 00:50:48,689
- I am.
- Okay.

761
00:50:50,959 --> 00:50:51,959
Okay.

762
00:50:54,896 --> 00:50:57,408
- Come on in.
- All right. You sure or...

763
00:50:57,432 --> 00:51:00,832
Yeah. I mean, I assume
that is why you are in Paris,

764
00:51:01,202 --> 00:51:02,646
at my door, with a suitcase.

765
00:51:02,670 --> 00:51:05,182
Yeah. I mean, if it is
a bad time or...

766
00:51:05,206 --> 00:51:06,473
- Come in.
- Okay.

767
00:51:21,089 --> 00:51:23,022
How did you know where I was?

768
00:51:24,125 --> 00:51:25,125
I have my ways.

769
00:51:26,661 --> 00:51:29,528
- This is beautiful, nice.
- Thanks. Yeah.

770
00:51:31,209 --> 00:51:32,209
Thanks.

771
00:51:32,233 --> 00:51:34,433
I brought you something.

772
00:51:43,345 --> 00:51:44,478
Right.

773
00:51:45,781 --> 00:51:46,914
- Clogs.
- Yeah.

774
00:51:47,550 --> 00:51:49,483
They are handmade, in America.

775
00:51:50,329 --> 00:51:51,329
Thanks.

776
00:51:51,353 --> 00:51:53,165
How did you find this place?

777
00:51:53,189 --> 00:51:56,256
Well, a couple who
are friends of my mom's...

778
00:51:58,427 --> 00:52:00,160
It is their son's.

779
00:52:01,764 --> 00:52:02,764
Is he here?

780
00:52:03,399 --> 00:52:04,399
No, no.

781
00:52:05,234 --> 00:52:06,711
He was when I got here.

782
00:52:06,735 --> 00:52:10,135
He is staying in Provence
with his family now.

783
00:52:13,242 --> 00:52:16,154
I actually went down there
for a couple of days

784
00:52:16,178 --> 00:52:18,311
to stay with his
family and him.

785
00:52:19,515 --> 00:52:20,582
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

786
00:52:26,088 --> 00:52:29,822
What is he...? What does him
do this son? How old is he?

787
00:52:31,895 --> 00:52:34,695
He is 32 years.
He is a classical violinist.

788
00:52:36,533 --> 00:52:38,466
He tours around with his dad.

789
00:52:42,706 --> 00:52:45,306
It is funny, I just
watched 400 Blows.

790
00:52:49,446 --> 00:52:50,446
Yeah?

791
00:52:50,647 --> 00:52:55,380
Well, no, I am just saying because it
is French and all, and here we are.

792
00:52:57,454 --> 00:52:58,654
It is coincidence.

793
00:53:04,427 --> 00:53:05,760
Did he play for you?

794
00:53:06,796 --> 00:53:08,396
- Did whom...
- The kid.

795
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,067
Guillaume. Yeah.

796
00:53:12,469 --> 00:53:13,536
Is he okay or...

797
00:53:14,070 --> 00:53:15,070
He was amazing.

798
00:53:17,774 --> 00:53:18,884
What did he play?

799
00:53:18,908 --> 00:53:21,221
I think he played some Mozart.

800
00:53:21,245 --> 00:53:23,778
Mozart. Yeah, it
is pretty music.

801
00:53:27,718 --> 00:53:31,718
It is interesting because it is
not as technically challenging

802
00:53:32,490 --> 00:53:35,290
as other composers,
you know, Bach and...

803
00:53:35,770 --> 00:53:36,770
it sounded nice.

804
00:53:36,794 --> 00:53:39,527
No. That is the thing.
It does, you know.

805
00:53:40,765 --> 00:53:42,365
Even though it is easier.

806
00:53:51,642 --> 00:53:52,842
So how long are...

807
00:53:53,544 --> 00:53:56,411
When are you
supposed to go back?

808
00:53:56,647 --> 00:53:58,380
How long are you here?

809
00:53:58,482 --> 00:54:01,815
I cannot remember.
I have to check the ticket.

810
00:54:02,620 --> 00:54:04,220
It is flexible. I mean...

811
00:54:04,955 --> 00:54:06,355
Yeah.

812
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:12,494
What is happening?
Do you not want me here?

813
00:54:14,566 --> 00:54:15,766
No, it is not that.

814
00:54:18,236 --> 00:54:19,769
I am sorry, it is just...

815
00:54:20,172 --> 00:54:22,839
Jesus Christ!
I was not expecting this.

816
00:54:24,309 --> 00:54:26,442
Yeah, because it
was a surprise.

817
00:54:27,245 --> 00:54:29,578
I am here in Paris
to win you back.

818
00:54:30,649 --> 00:54:32,727
This supposed to
be my time to...

819
00:54:32,751 --> 00:54:34,951
- Find yourself, I know.
- Yeah.

820
00:54:35,087 --> 00:54:38,487
Well, I came to tell you
that you can stop looking

821
00:54:40,592 --> 00:54:43,259
because you are perfect
the way you are.

822
00:54:46,031 --> 00:54:49,898
You know, this has brought up
many issues for me too.

823
00:54:52,571 --> 00:54:53,971
I just do not know

824
00:54:56,641 --> 00:54:58,386
if you are ready
to be with me.

825
00:54:58,410 --> 00:55:01,077
I am. I, you know,
explored and grew...

826
00:55:02,647 --> 00:55:04,781
Well, I may need
to do that too.

827
00:55:07,053 --> 00:55:08,053
Is there...

828
00:55:08,788 --> 00:55:11,121
Did you meet someone
or something?

829
00:55:14,060 --> 00:55:17,260
Wait, you met some fucking guy
named Guillaume?

830
00:55:18,231 --> 00:55:19,698
In like the last week.

831
00:55:21,334 --> 00:55:22,334
What happened?

832
00:55:22,445 --> 00:55:23,445
Are you with him now?

833
00:55:23,469 --> 00:55:25,681
You do not even know him.
This is bullshit.

834
00:55:25,705 --> 00:55:26,905
It is not bullshit.

835
00:55:27,273 --> 00:55:28,751
So what? It is real love.
Okay.

836
00:55:28,775 --> 00:55:30,652
Sorry, I forgot
running off to Paris.

837
00:55:30,676 --> 00:55:32,121
The odds are that
within the first week,

838
00:55:32,145 --> 00:55:33,505
You will meet the man
of your dreams.

839
00:55:33,529 --> 00:55:35,173
The world according
to Nancy Meyers.

840
00:55:35,197 --> 00:55:37,393
It has nothing to do
with getting back at me.

841
00:55:37,417 --> 00:55:39,361
You were not even
supposed to be here.

842
00:55:39,385 --> 00:55:41,096
How is this about
you right now?

843
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:43,853
And do not judge my
feelings or romances.

844
00:55:45,191 --> 00:55:47,469
You thought you are in love
with some wannabe model.

845
00:55:47,493 --> 00:55:49,438
She modeled once for Mervyn's.

846
00:55:49,462 --> 00:55:54,195
My feelings were misguided and I
am now mature enough to see that.

847
00:55:54,767 --> 00:55:55,767
Are you?

848
00:55:57,905 --> 00:55:59,282
Have you slept with him?

849
00:55:59,306 --> 00:55:59,582
No.

850
00:55:59,606 --> 00:56:02,819
- But you stayed with him in Prussia or...
- Provence.

851
00:56:02,843 --> 00:56:04,888
- Whatever and did you not sleep with him?
- No.

852
00:56:04,912 --> 00:56:06,089
- Did you kiss him?
- Quinn...

853
00:56:06,113 --> 00:56:08,558
You know what,
I do not even want to know.

854
00:56:08,582 --> 00:56:09,125
Where are you going?

855
00:56:09,149 --> 00:56:11,728
You do not even know your way
back home and you grew up there.

856
00:56:11,752 --> 00:56:14,864
Well, maybe we should phone
Guillaume at his country house

857
00:56:14,888 --> 00:56:15,565
and ask him for directions.

858
00:56:15,589 --> 00:56:17,767
See if he has any recommendations
for city hotspots.

859
00:56:17,791 --> 00:56:20,069
I am sure he could tell us
where the Fitzgerald's,

860
00:56:20,093 --> 00:56:23,560
or Hemingway used to
smoke opium or whatever. What?

861
00:56:23,874 --> 00:56:24,874
No, it is just...

862
00:56:24,898 --> 00:56:29,898
Scott Fitzgerald actually lived in
their house in Provence for a while.

863
00:56:30,237 --> 00:56:32,637
Well, that is most
fucking amusing.

864
00:56:37,244 --> 00:56:38,244
Merci.

865
00:56:45,329 --> 00:56:46,329
You do not smoke.

866
00:56:46,353 --> 00:56:49,154
Starting is the hardest
part, ma Chrie.

867
00:56:57,799 --> 00:56:58,799
Galois's.

868
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:01,333
It will put hair
on your chest.

869
00:57:01,736 --> 00:57:04,336
I preferred your chest
the way it was.

870
00:57:39,207 --> 00:57:40,207
One.

871
00:57:40,842 --> 00:57:41,843
Two.

872
00:57:42,745 --> 00:57:43,745
Three.

873
00:57:47,716 --> 00:57:50,896
If I spit it in the water,
will it come back to life?

874
00:58:35,465 --> 00:58:38,065
No, no, no, we cannot
do it on his bed.

875
00:58:38,435 --> 00:58:39,435
What?

876
00:58:40,470 --> 00:58:41,470
Okay, okay.

877
00:58:42,872 --> 00:58:44,784
This is only good if
you have scoliosis.

878
00:58:44,808 --> 00:58:46,875
Yeah, this is the greatest.

879
00:58:53,416 --> 00:58:57,283
My God, that is like Danish
deco, like expensive.

880
00:58:58,588 --> 00:58:59,588
How about this thing?

881
00:58:59,589 --> 00:59:02,034
This thing, it is like
a Napoleon era...

882
00:59:02,058 --> 00:59:04,136
I do not give a shit.
Just, here.

883
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:06,093
I do, I am sorry.
I am a guest.

884
00:59:10,166 --> 00:59:11,166
Okay.

885
00:59:13,503 --> 00:59:16,916
Just be careful. It is like
a Franco-Prussian teacup.

886
00:59:16,940 --> 00:59:19,273
What, are you
his fucking curator?

887
00:59:19,409 --> 00:59:20,409
Sorry, kind of.

888
00:59:29,053 --> 00:59:31,186
- Good morning.
- Hi.

889
00:59:31,722 --> 00:59:34,055
Do you sleep well?

890
00:59:35,860 --> 00:59:38,605
So I was thinking,
we should call the airline.

891
00:59:38,629 --> 00:59:42,096
And try to get tickets to
go home today or tonight.

892
00:59:43,401 --> 00:59:45,268
What?

893
00:59:47,304 --> 00:59:48,304
Tomorrow.

894
00:59:53,411 --> 00:59:54,411
Devon.

895
01:00:10,161 --> 01:00:12,406
Fuck it. I am going
to enjoy Paris.

896
01:00:12,430 --> 01:00:15,897
I am not going to let some
fucking cultural attach.

897
01:00:16,734 --> 01:00:18,278
Whatever he is,
ruin my time here.

898
01:00:18,302 --> 01:00:20,062
You want to sip Dandelion
wine in the country

899
01:00:20,086 --> 01:00:22,806
rave about socialism,
eat whelks and winkles

900
01:00:22,830 --> 01:00:25,253
suck the meat out
of a cockle, go ahead.

901
01:00:25,277 --> 01:00:26,877
Move to France, why not.

902
01:00:27,122 --> 01:00:28,122
Yeah, but...

903
01:00:28,146 --> 01:00:31,413
I am on vacation. Therefore, I
will see you when I see you.

904
01:00:32,084 --> 01:00:33,084
Right now,

905
01:00:33,919 --> 01:00:35,786
I am in the mood for a crepe.

906
01:00:44,339 --> 01:00:45,339
I am sorry.

907
01:00:45,363 --> 01:00:49,696
I would not want to embarrass you
by crying in a fucking graveyard.

908
01:00:57,953 --> 01:00:58,953
Why him?

909
01:00:58,977 --> 01:01:01,444
It is not that I
want to be with him.

910
01:01:02,013 --> 01:01:04,413
It just opened my
eyes, you know.

911
01:01:06,118 --> 01:01:07,495
He is older, he cooks.

912
01:01:07,519 --> 01:01:10,765
He and his dad played sonatas
for me in their living room.

913
01:01:10,789 --> 01:01:13,457
We talked about art,
politics and...

914
01:01:15,361 --> 01:01:16,561
He loves Flaubert.

915
01:01:18,064 --> 01:01:21,464
His family is just very
passionate about real stuff,

916
01:01:23,936 --> 01:01:25,403
and we just connected.

917
01:01:26,205 --> 01:01:27,205
Therefore, he cooks.

918
01:01:27,707 --> 01:01:29,184
I am sorry, I do not cook.

919
01:01:29,208 --> 01:01:32,075
My family ordered in
a lot when I was kid.

920
01:01:41,087 --> 01:01:43,487
I think I would like
to be buried here.

921
01:01:45,658 --> 01:01:46,925
Today, if possible.

922
01:01:51,130 --> 01:01:55,730
It must have been a bad crepe, I have
never had the dry heaves before.

923
01:01:56,035 --> 01:01:58,702
Yeah, it was incredibly
anti-climactic.

924
01:02:01,007 --> 01:02:02,274
What are you doing?

925
01:02:02,742 --> 01:02:05,210
I have a lunch in
about an hour.

926
01:02:07,080 --> 01:02:08,280
A lunch? With who?

927
01:02:10,250 --> 01:02:11,317
My grandparents.

928
01:02:11,718 --> 01:02:13,651
I have never met them.

929
01:02:16,023 --> 01:02:17,556
I am going alone, Quinn.

930
01:02:19,226 --> 01:02:20,293
I am not invited.

931
01:02:21,172 --> 01:02:22,172
Quinn...

932
01:02:22,196 --> 01:02:23,840
I flew all the way
out here to be with you.

933
01:02:23,864 --> 01:02:27,110
And you just sleep with me like I
am some kind of boy-toy and...

934
01:02:27,134 --> 01:02:30,113
Okay, first, I did not
ask you to come out here.

935
01:02:30,137 --> 01:02:34,337
No, you could not do that because
do not know what you want.

936
01:02:34,675 --> 01:02:36,419
Therefore, you are just
stringing me along?

937
01:02:36,443 --> 01:02:39,856
Yeah, right, okay. You are the
victim. You are the martyr.

938
01:02:39,880 --> 01:02:43,880
Did you pack your crucifix or
did they let you carry it on?

939
01:02:44,852 --> 01:02:45,852
Jesus.

940
01:02:46,086 --> 01:02:47,819
I am not martyring myself.

941
01:02:49,356 --> 01:02:52,023
You know how
selfish this is of you.

942
01:02:52,736 --> 01:02:53,736
Of me?

943
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:57,608
You live your life as if it is going
to be brilliant when it really counts.

944
01:02:57,632 --> 01:02:59,432
Well, it is passing you by...

945
01:03:00,401 --> 01:03:01,668
look at your music.

946
01:03:02,103 --> 01:03:03,770
How can you be a musician?

947
01:03:03,805 --> 01:03:06,650
When you are too afraid to
play in front of anyone?

948
01:03:06,674 --> 01:03:07,674
I am a perfectionist.

949
01:03:07,675 --> 01:03:09,386
And I told you my hand span...

950
01:03:09,410 --> 01:03:13,677
Shut the fuck up about
your goddamned hand span.

951
01:03:14,649 --> 01:03:20,049
You are just masquerading as this sensitive,
magnanimous, self-deprecating person.

952
01:03:22,523 --> 01:03:24,201
Your idea of self-deprecation

953
01:03:24,225 --> 01:03:27,292
is everybody else's
definition of narcissism.

954
01:03:32,010 --> 01:03:33,010
Well...

955
01:03:33,034 --> 01:03:34,345
I know you came here

956
01:03:34,369 --> 01:03:36,102
to bring me back with you.

957
01:03:37,939 --> 01:03:41,472
However, I do not want to go
back, I want to move forward.

958
01:04:32,127 --> 01:04:33,460
I feel like I am just

959
01:04:33,862 --> 01:04:36,262
looking for the
name of the disease

960
01:04:36,932 --> 01:04:38,599
that makes me make sense.

961
01:04:41,371 --> 01:04:42,571
How do I be a man?

962
01:05:14,104 --> 01:05:15,104
Hello.

963
01:05:15,372 --> 01:05:17,705
Hi! You do speak a
little English.

964
01:05:19,075 --> 01:05:20,075
Hello.

965
01:05:21,011 --> 01:05:22,011
Okay.

966
01:05:24,624 --> 01:05:25,624
Sorry, I am late.

967
01:05:25,648 --> 01:05:28,648
I could not find the address,
but then I did.

968
01:05:28,718 --> 01:05:30,096
- Quinn...
- Devon, please.

969
01:05:30,120 --> 01:05:33,121
Look, I have been trying to
ask you something.

970
01:05:33,724 --> 01:05:35,657
Quinn, this is Guillaume.

971
01:05:36,394 --> 01:05:37,394
Quinn...

972
01:05:37,928 --> 01:05:41,261
I did not know you were
joining us for lunch, pal.

973
01:05:43,267 --> 01:05:44,267
I am Guillaume.

974
01:05:46,804 --> 01:05:48,137
So nice to meet you.

975
01:05:48,372 --> 01:05:50,372
I thought you were French.

976
01:05:52,843 --> 01:05:55,122
Yeah, well, my
father is French.

977
01:05:55,146 --> 01:05:56,613
Yeah, just like Devon.

978
01:05:56,814 --> 01:05:58,881
I will go fetch you a plate.

979
01:06:04,789 --> 01:06:06,256
What is he doing here?

980
01:06:07,625 --> 01:06:10,425
And why has he being
so fucking nice to me?

981
01:06:10,528 --> 01:06:11,995
Yeah, what an asshole.

982
01:06:19,170 --> 01:06:23,517
He says, he is sorry that they only
have a footstool for you to sit on.

983
01:06:23,541 --> 01:06:27,875
No, no, no. It is my
favorite kind of stool.

984
01:06:28,246 --> 01:06:29,624
Yeah, speaking with
a French accent.

985
01:06:29,648 --> 01:06:31,492
Is not going to help
he understands you.

986
01:06:43,762 --> 01:06:45,406
He wants you to have
an aperitif with him.

987
01:06:45,430 --> 01:06:47,497
I just had a crepe... Okay.

988
01:06:53,482 --> 01:06:54,482
It is Pernod.

989
01:06:54,506 --> 01:06:57,973
He says, he has been drinking
it since he was a baby.

990
01:06:58,787 --> 01:06:59,787
What is in it?

991
01:06:59,811 --> 01:07:00,891
It derived from licorice.

992
01:07:00,915 --> 01:07:04,692
It is a successor of absinthe,
relative of ouzo in Greece.

993
01:07:04,716 --> 01:07:07,516
That does put it in
many contexts for me.

994
01:07:15,627 --> 01:07:19,228
She got sushi for me
because she knows I like it.

995
01:07:31,677 --> 01:07:33,388
They are saying,
you have a French face.

996
01:07:33,412 --> 01:07:37,545
Thank you. It is awkward, because
I have an Algerian neck.

997
01:07:38,484 --> 01:07:40,284
Therefore, they are
always fighting.

998
01:07:44,957 --> 01:07:48,203
They are not going to get it,
also its offensive.

999
01:07:48,227 --> 01:07:49,560
Do not edit my jokes.

1000
01:07:50,596 --> 01:07:51,596
Fine.

1001
01:08:05,221 --> 01:08:06,221
See.

1002
01:08:06,245 --> 01:08:07,578
The timing was not...

1003
01:08:07,947 --> 01:08:09,814
I thought it was very funny.

1004
01:08:19,560 --> 01:08:24,293
She says, she knows you were not
originally going to come out to Paris.

1005
01:08:25,632 --> 01:08:27,165
What changed your mind?

1006
01:08:30,737 --> 01:08:31,737
I...

1007
01:08:32,406 --> 01:08:34,939
realized I could not be
without Devon.

1008
01:08:51,391 --> 01:08:52,924
I want to wake up early

1009
01:08:54,428 --> 01:08:57,095
just so I can spend
more time with her.

1010
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:01,333
When I am around her,

1011
01:09:03,104 --> 01:09:04,104
the rhythm of...

1012
01:09:05,807 --> 01:09:06,807
my breathing...

1013
01:09:09,410 --> 01:09:10,610
literally changes.

1014
01:09:13,715 --> 01:09:14,715
I need her.

1015
01:09:20,255 --> 01:09:21,588
That is why I am here.

1016
01:09:37,138 --> 01:09:38,271
What did she say?

1017
01:09:39,907 --> 01:09:42,707
She wants to know
if anyone wants cheese?

1018
01:10:02,665 --> 01:10:03,798
Mozart?

1019
01:10:05,267 --> 01:10:06,267
A genius.

1020
01:10:07,102 --> 01:10:08,102
Yeah.

1021
01:10:08,537 --> 01:10:09,781
Second concerto, right?

1022
01:10:09,805 --> 01:10:11,538
Yeah. How about that?

1023
01:10:12,741 --> 01:10:13,741
Are you a fan?

1024
01:10:14,176 --> 01:10:16,443
I more familiar with
jazz, but, yeah,

1025
01:10:16,478 --> 01:10:18,545
You see, jazz...

1026
01:10:19,281 --> 01:10:21,548
It all sounds the
same to me, no.

1027
01:10:22,151 --> 01:10:26,218
Guillaume, what was the story
you told me about your violin.

1028
01:10:26,955 --> 01:10:28,933
Not much of a story. But...

1029
01:10:28,957 --> 01:10:31,624
Yes, this is a Jean
Baptiste Vuillaume.

1030
01:10:32,428 --> 01:10:34,961
There was perhaps
3,000 of them made.

1031
01:10:36,432 --> 01:10:41,099
This instrument probably costs
somewhere in neighborhood of $250,000.

1032
01:10:43,205 --> 01:10:45,138
If you can put a price on it.

1033
01:10:51,514 --> 01:10:53,447
It seems unusually small, no.

1034
01:10:56,252 --> 01:10:57,496
This is my baby.

1035
01:10:57,520 --> 01:11:00,920
My godfather is Pierre Boulez.
A famous conductor.

1036
01:11:02,459 --> 01:11:04,926
And he gave this
violin to my father,

1037
01:11:04,994 --> 01:11:08,527
when he was first chair
for the Orchestra de Paris.

1038
01:11:08,732 --> 01:11:12,332
One of my favorite orchestras.

1039
01:11:12,502 --> 01:11:14,569
You know, Quinn,
Flaubert said:

1040
01:11:14,871 --> 01:11:16,916
"Human speech is
a cracked kettle"

1041
01:11:16,940 --> 01:11:21,007
"upon which we tap crude rhythms
for the bears to dance to,"

1042
01:11:21,177 --> 01:11:24,444
"while we long to make music
to melt the stars."

1043
01:11:29,519 --> 01:11:30,930
Quinn plays the piano.

1044
01:11:30,954 --> 01:11:31,797
Yeah, I do.

1045
01:11:31,821 --> 01:11:33,341
- Yeah.
- Dev, can I ask you something?

1046
01:11:33,365 --> 01:11:36,165
That is so neat.
Are you going to play for us?

1047
01:11:39,964 --> 01:11:41,364
Sure.

1048
01:11:48,105 --> 01:11:50,572
I have never played
a Bluthner before.

1049
01:11:52,643 --> 01:11:54,243
But I will give it a shot.

1050
01:13:55,635 --> 01:13:57,302
You finished learning it.

1051
01:13:58,070 --> 01:14:00,803
My God. Quinn,
your eye is insanely red.

1052
01:14:02,575 --> 01:14:04,308
What? What?

1053
01:14:05,878 --> 01:14:07,011
It must be the...

1054
01:14:11,117 --> 01:14:13,184
- What is it?
- Pingueculitis.

1055
01:14:13,219 --> 01:14:14,696
I do not know how
to say it in French.

1056
01:14:14,720 --> 01:14:15,960
I can barely say
it in English.

1057
01:14:15,984 --> 01:14:19,052
Let me get you a warm
washcloth or something.

1058
01:14:21,628 --> 01:14:22,895
Okay, <i>Excusez-moi.</i>

1059
01:14:27,901 --> 01:14:28,901
Quinn.

1060
01:14:29,036 --> 01:14:30,036
I am in here.

1061
01:14:32,839 --> 01:14:33,839
Hi.

1062
01:14:33,941 --> 01:14:34,817
What the fuck?

1063
01:14:34,841 --> 01:14:36,574
Your eye looks crazo.

1064
01:14:36,910 --> 01:14:38,910
What? What are you doing here?

1065
01:14:39,746 --> 01:14:42,346
The address in the database,
remember.

1066
01:14:43,383 --> 01:14:44,827
Okay, this is awkward.

1067
01:14:44,851 --> 01:14:46,584
No shit. This is not okay.

1068
01:14:47,087 --> 01:14:50,354
I am making a fool of myself
just like you said.

1069
01:14:50,390 --> 01:14:51,723
No. No, no, no. I...

1070
01:14:51,758 --> 01:14:56,205
Thank you for coming all the
way out here for me, Kelsey.

1071
01:14:56,229 --> 01:14:56,639
Quinn, I want...

1072
01:14:56,663 --> 01:14:58,903
Stop talking to me as me. That
is insane that you do that.

1073
01:14:58,927 --> 01:15:02,860
I do not feel that way about
you, Kelsey. Jesus, I am sorry.

1074
01:15:05,038 --> 01:15:06,382
I was actually...

1075
01:15:09,777 --> 01:15:13,110
No, no, no. No prostitute.
A friend. A comrade.

1076
01:15:17,318 --> 01:15:18,318
My Vuillaume.

1077
01:15:37,605 --> 01:15:38,605
My God. My God.

1078
01:15:50,318 --> 01:15:53,985
Jameson, pick up. Fuck!

1079
01:16:04,443 --> 01:16:05,443
Hello.

1080
01:16:05,467 --> 01:16:07,479
Kurt, do not hang up.
Please. I am in trouble.

1081
01:16:07,503 --> 01:16:08,580
<i>- Are you in trouble?</i>
- Yes.

1082
01:16:08,604 --> 01:16:11,471
I mean, not physically.
Although, kind of.

1083
01:16:12,341 --> 01:16:13,341
All right.

1084
01:16:13,475 --> 01:16:14,085
<i>I want your sister back.</i>

1085
01:16:14,109 --> 01:16:17,255
I am in Paris and I need her.
I want to marry her.

1086
01:16:17,279 --> 01:16:20,879
She is about to go to Provence,
with some French tool.

1087
01:16:20,983 --> 01:16:23,862
Dude, I am in the middle
of a job interview right now.

1088
01:16:23,886 --> 01:16:25,953
Kurt, please! You
are my friend.

1089
01:16:26,755 --> 01:16:27,755
<i>Do you want her?</i>

1090
01:16:27,856 --> 01:16:30,301
Because if you hurt her again,
I will destroy you.

1091
01:16:30,325 --> 01:16:32,125
I know. I will not, I promise.

1092
01:16:32,895 --> 01:16:33,895
<i>Okay.</i>

1093
01:16:34,430 --> 01:16:35,430
<i>All right.</i>

1094
01:16:35,698 --> 01:16:37,208
<i>You listen very
carefully, okay?</i>

1095
01:16:37,232 --> 01:16:40,478
I am not just saying this
because I know my sister.

1096
01:16:40,502 --> 01:16:43,035
I am saying this
because I know women.

1097
01:16:44,106 --> 01:16:46,239
You tell her: She
cannot see him.

1098
01:16:47,576 --> 01:16:48,709
She will see him.

1099
01:16:49,745 --> 01:16:51,345
And she will fuck him...

1100
01:16:52,915 --> 01:16:53,915
Tonight.

1101
01:16:55,318 --> 01:16:56,518
I do not know.

1102
01:16:57,153 --> 01:16:58,353
She will fuck him.

1103
01:17:01,224 --> 01:17:02,624
Well, what I do then.

1104
01:17:04,561 --> 01:17:05,561
Hello?

1105
01:17:09,332 --> 01:17:10,599
Hello? Kurt, hello?

1106
01:17:18,842 --> 01:17:19,842
Shit.

1107
01:17:28,852 --> 01:17:29,852
Hi.

1108
01:17:38,394 --> 01:17:40,261
I have caused quite a tumult

1109
01:17:45,034 --> 01:17:46,034
here today.

1110
01:17:47,738 --> 01:17:51,205
You want to translate that
or they will get the gist?

1111
01:17:52,143 --> 01:17:53,276
You can recap.

1112
01:17:56,547 --> 01:17:57,547
Anyhow,

1113
01:17:59,917 --> 01:18:00,917
I am sorry...

1114
01:18:01,986 --> 01:18:02,986
to everyone.

1115
01:18:05,156 --> 01:18:06,489
I hope to make it up...

1116
01:18:07,124 --> 01:18:08,257
and repay you all...

1117
01:18:11,328 --> 01:18:12,328
emotionally.

1118
01:18:15,132 --> 01:18:18,799
I did this in a clumsy attempt
to win you back, Devon.

1119
01:18:24,408 --> 01:18:26,208
I apologize for the carnage...

1120
01:18:28,345 --> 01:18:30,412
that has accrued
along the way.

1121
01:18:32,249 --> 01:18:34,982
Needless to say,
I will be going home now.

1122
01:18:40,725 --> 01:18:41,925
I love you, Devon.

1123
01:18:45,397 --> 01:18:47,330
I hope you can remember that.

1124
01:18:52,037 --> 01:18:53,037
Sorry.

1125
01:18:56,074 --> 01:18:57,074
Excusez-moi.

1126
01:19:12,457 --> 01:19:16,057
<i>Like any organ does
as we grow older,</i>

1127
01:19:16,561 --> 01:19:18,094
<i>the eye deteriorate...</i>

1128
01:19:18,597 --> 01:19:19,930
My baby boy.

1129
01:19:22,300 --> 01:19:24,233
So, how was Paris? All right?

1130
01:19:24,803 --> 01:19:25,936
It was...

1131
01:19:26,238 --> 01:19:29,038
I do not want to say
epically emasculating...

1132
01:19:29,541 --> 01:19:32,009
on a trans-continental level.
However...

1133
01:19:32,856 --> 01:19:33,856
No, actually I do.

1134
01:19:33,880 --> 01:19:35,557
Yeah, it is hard being a man.

1135
01:19:35,581 --> 01:19:40,181
And the hardest part is that it
becomes less acceptable to be a boy.

1136
01:19:40,353 --> 01:19:41,886
Do you love her? Devon?

1137
01:19:42,121 --> 01:19:44,654
I love her so much,
but I screwed up.

1138
01:20:55,963 --> 01:20:58,430
How did you know where I was?

1139
01:20:58,799 --> 01:21:00,266
I have my ways.

1140
01:21:02,703 --> 01:21:05,648
I heard you were
coming back tomorrow.

1141
01:21:05,672 --> 01:21:08,205
I wanted to surprise you.

1142
01:21:10,544 --> 01:21:11,677
Sweet gig.

1143
01:21:12,346 --> 01:21:13,346
Yeah.

1144
01:21:13,647 --> 01:21:15,914
They pay me in
pad sees, but...

1145
01:21:18,486 --> 01:21:21,419
You know, I could stay
with Jameson tonight...

1146
01:21:22,357 --> 01:21:23,890
if you want some space.

1147
01:21:25,626 --> 01:21:26,626
Quinn...

1148
01:21:27,628 --> 01:21:28,961
I came back for you.

1149
01:21:32,166 --> 01:21:33,166
Really?

1150
01:21:35,737 --> 01:21:36,737
I missed you.

1151
01:21:37,071 --> 01:21:38,938
There is a ring in my trunk.

1152
01:21:40,108 --> 01:21:41,108
What?

1153
01:21:41,209 --> 01:21:42,619
I have something in my trunk...

1154
01:21:42,643 --> 01:21:44,310
that I wanted to give you...

1155
01:21:47,048 --> 01:21:48,092
just at some point.

1156
01:21:48,116 --> 01:21:50,649
What? What is it?
Did you say a ring?

1157
01:21:51,519 --> 01:21:52,519
A ring?

1158
01:21:54,489 --> 01:21:55,489
Yeah.

1159
01:21:56,157 --> 01:21:57,757
Are you proposing to me?

1160
01:22:01,596 --> 01:22:02,596
Hang on.

1161
01:22:17,980 --> 01:22:18,980
Here.

1162
01:22:22,584 --> 01:22:23,584
What is this?

1163
01:22:25,988 --> 01:22:27,521
I guess, I guess...

1164
01:22:30,359 --> 01:22:31,492
I am asking you to...

1165
01:22:34,263 --> 01:22:35,263
marry me.

1166
01:22:35,864 --> 01:22:36,864
Do you guess?

1167
01:22:37,299 --> 01:22:39,032
No. No, no, no. I am. I...

1168
01:22:41,870 --> 01:22:42,937
I am.

1169
01:22:43,939 --> 01:22:45,006
- Here.
- Okay.

1170
01:22:49,711 --> 01:22:50,711
Sorry.

1171
01:23:05,128 --> 01:23:06,128
Devon,

1172
01:23:08,231 --> 01:23:09,431
will you marry me?

1173
01:23:11,334 --> 01:23:12,334
My God! Yes.

1174
01:23:15,438 --> 01:23:16,438
- Yes?
- Yeah.

1175
01:23:18,508 --> 01:23:19,508
I will.

1176
01:23:20,443 --> 01:23:22,376
I cannot believe you did this.

1177
01:23:23,913 --> 01:23:24,913
I cannot either.

1178
01:23:25,348 --> 01:23:27,760
I wanted it to be
more romantic.

1179
01:23:27,784 --> 01:23:28,784
No.

1180
01:23:29,219 --> 01:23:30,619
I just could not wait.

1181
01:23:31,821 --> 01:23:32,888
I could not wait.

1182
01:23:33,957 --> 01:23:34,957
I love you.

1183
01:23:41,164 --> 01:23:42,164
I love you.

1184
01:23:46,169 --> 01:23:49,569
There is one last thing
I should probably tell you.

1185
01:23:51,107 --> 01:23:52,107
What?

1186
01:23:53,209 --> 01:23:55,589
I slept with someone
while we were apart...

1187
01:23:55,613 --> 01:23:58,146
and I told you I had
not seen anybody.

1188
01:23:58,315 --> 01:24:01,061
That happened, but we
were not together.

1189
01:24:01,085 --> 01:24:02,752
You did not even know her.

1190
01:24:02,987 --> 01:24:06,787
It was just purely me trying
to get it out of my system.

1191
01:24:06,957 --> 01:24:08,397
As you said, I did
not even like it.

1192
01:24:08,421 --> 01:24:11,725
I wanted to have a clean slate
before we get married...

1193
01:24:11,862 --> 01:24:12,929
and that is it.

1194
01:24:13,731 --> 01:24:14,731
So...

1195
01:24:18,936 --> 01:24:19,936
Are you mad?

1196
01:24:23,174 --> 01:24:24,507
You do not want to...

1197
01:24:39,757 --> 01:24:40,757
I am sorry.

1198
01:24:42,293 --> 01:24:43,293
Are you okay?

1199
01:24:47,265 --> 01:24:48,265
How could you?

1200
01:24:50,302 --> 01:24:52,902
How could you ruin
this moment for me?

1201
01:24:56,741 --> 01:24:59,941
I am not even upset about
the other part, but...

1202
01:25:01,613 --> 01:25:04,813
I cannot tell my friends,
my parents this story.

1203
01:25:07,752 --> 01:25:08,752
Sure, you can.

1204
01:25:10,088 --> 01:25:11,955
You can leave this part out.

1205
01:25:14,159 --> 01:25:16,159
Just not even excited anymore.

1206
01:25:17,696 --> 01:25:18,696
I am not happy.

1207
01:25:19,497 --> 01:25:21,630
And it is fucking
September 11th.

1208
01:25:23,868 --> 01:25:25,201
Shit, is that today?

1209
01:25:27,305 --> 01:25:29,572
I did not realize.

1210
01:25:31,476 --> 01:25:33,143
Well, we will never forget.

1211
01:25:35,347 --> 01:25:37,347
We can just get past this.

1212
01:25:38,651 --> 01:25:41,451
I mean, we are still
going to get married.

1213
01:25:42,722 --> 01:25:45,455
I do not want to talk
about it right now.

1214
01:25:47,760 --> 01:25:49,227
You are not considering

1215
01:25:52,465 --> 01:25:54,132
not marrying me, are you?

1216
01:25:54,567 --> 01:25:56,545
I do not want to
talk about it.

1217
01:25:56,569 --> 01:25:57,569
However, I, I...

1218
01:25:57,870 --> 01:25:59,003
I made a mistake.

1219
01:26:01,040 --> 01:26:03,040
I was just trying
to be honest,

1220
01:26:04,977 --> 01:26:06,110
with you, for us.

1221
01:26:06,912 --> 01:26:08,245
Not for me. I swear.

1222
01:26:10,449 --> 01:26:11,493
I have been dreaming...

1223
01:26:11,517 --> 01:26:14,850
about how I was going to
propose to my girlfriend...

1224
01:26:15,488 --> 01:26:16,688
since third grade.

1225
01:26:18,524 --> 01:26:20,791
This was not what
it looked like.

1226
01:26:21,327 --> 01:26:22,994
I ruined it.

1227
01:26:23,339 --> 01:26:24,339
I fucked this up.

1228
01:26:24,363 --> 01:26:28,744
You are the love of my life. I fucked
this up. I have ruined your moment too.

1229
01:26:28,768 --> 01:26:30,168
Please, just say yes.

1230
01:26:30,904 --> 01:26:32,504
Call people. Enjoy this.

1231
01:26:32,616 --> 01:26:33,616
I will do anything.

1232
01:26:33,640 --> 01:26:35,560
Here, just come back outside.
I will propose you again.

1233
01:26:35,584 --> 01:26:37,842
Please, just switch
your brain off.

1234
01:26:38,011 --> 01:26:40,344
It is willpower.
Please! I am sorry!

1235
01:26:40,714 --> 01:26:42,314
Please say yes. Say yes!

1236
01:26:42,883 --> 01:26:44,416
Please! Please say yes!

1237
01:26:44,484 --> 01:26:45,484
Okay, okay.

1238
01:26:50,891 --> 01:26:51,891
Okay?

1239
01:26:52,893 --> 01:26:53,893
Okay.

1240
01:26:56,129 --> 01:26:57,129
Okay.

1241
01:27:08,108 --> 01:27:10,375
What the fuck is that?

1242
01:27:12,346 --> 01:27:13,679
The Net did not open.

1243
01:27:14,715 --> 01:27:15,715
What?

1244
01:27:16,116 --> 01:27:18,983
The plan was to propose
when you got back.

1245
01:27:19,920 --> 01:27:23,100
