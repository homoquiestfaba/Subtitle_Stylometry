00:00:57,212 --> 00:00:58,611
<i>Do you forgive me?</i>

5
00:02:57,566 --> 00:02:59,332
- What's happening?

6
00:03:01,203 --> 00:03:02,368
Let's go, let's go!

7
00:03:12,581 --> 00:03:13,713
You okay?

8
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:16,382
Be careful.

9
00:03:40,342 --> 00:03:41,908
Step aside.

10
00:03:44,579 --> 00:03:45,745
Turn around.

11
00:04:02,464 --> 00:04:03,663
On the table.

12
00:04:04,266 --> 00:04:05,365
Have a seat.

13
00:04:12,007 --> 00:04:13,439
Identification.

14
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:23,750
- William Freeman?
- Yeah.

15
00:04:23,752 --> 00:04:25,719
- You're from D.C.?
- Uh, no.

16
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,687
There's no William
on the lease records.

17
00:04:27,689 --> 00:04:29,722
- Oh, it was, um...
- Face forward.

18
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,793
It was, um,

19
00:04:33,795 --> 00:04:36,462
my girlfriend's place,
Carolyn Hartley.

20
00:04:37,666 --> 00:04:39,065
She didn't make it.

21
00:04:40,869 --> 00:04:43,569
And Eva Balsora?

22
00:04:43,571 --> 00:04:44,771
The other name on the lease.

23
00:04:46,741 --> 00:04:47,874
Eva.

24
00:04:49,511 --> 00:04:53,346
Yeah, she was, uh,
visiting her parents in England

25
00:04:53,348 --> 00:04:54,881
when everything happened.

26
00:04:54,883 --> 00:04:57,003
I haven't heard from her
or spoken to her.

27
00:05:08,963 --> 00:05:11,731
Don't move.
Stay right where I can see you.

28
00:05:16,805 --> 00:05:18,538
What is all of this?

29
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:19,806
It's quarantine.

30
00:05:19,808 --> 00:05:22,375
I built it to keep her safe.

31
00:05:23,611 --> 00:05:25,611
You sure went to
a lot of trouble.

32
00:05:26,881 --> 00:05:28,348
Yeah.

33
00:05:31,019 --> 00:05:32,552
Didn't work though.

34
00:05:33,021 --> 00:05:34,387
And these?

35
00:05:41,563 --> 00:05:42,829
Wanna explain these?

36
00:05:45,467 --> 00:05:46,833
They're mine.

37
00:05:49,037 --> 00:05:50,370
We're carriers, right?

38
00:06:01,783 --> 00:06:02,982
Sarge?

39
00:06:07,989 --> 00:06:09,088
Get up.

40
00:06:09,724 --> 00:06:11,057
Get up.

41
00:06:11,059 --> 00:06:12,392
Lead the way.

42
00:06:26,708 --> 00:06:27,974
What is this?

43
00:06:33,081 --> 00:06:35,081
Just a few that I knew.
That's all.

44
00:06:53,601 --> 00:06:54,834
All right, boys.

45
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:58,738
Apartment's clear. Let's move.

46
00:07:10,552 --> 00:07:12,051
You know, I'm impressed.

47
00:07:12,921 --> 00:07:14,687
You guys have lasted a while.

48
00:07:16,458 --> 00:07:19,492
Don't worry.
I'm not taking the sick one.

49
00:07:20,562 --> 00:07:22,602
I know what we do
with the sick ones.

50
00:07:22,997 --> 00:07:24,197
Sick one?

51
00:07:34,042 --> 00:07:35,708
Enjoy the next
few days with her.

52
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:03,836
Come on.

53
00:08:04,806 --> 00:08:06,038
Need to pack.

54
00:08:09,577 --> 00:08:10,743
I know.

55
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,980
It's time to go.

56
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:20,119
<i>-Okay.</i>

57
00:08:21,089 --> 00:08:22,655
I need this jacket.

58
00:08:22,657 --> 00:08:24,557
- Is it okay
if I take these, too?
Sure.

59
00:10:02,624 --> 00:10:04,724
<i>May I have your
attention please?</i>

60
00:10:04,726 --> 00:10:06,826
<i>May I have
your attention please?</i>

61
00:10:06,828 --> 00:10:09,228
<i>This is a state of emergency.</i>

62
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:12,331
<i>Tonight's curfew is in effect
for all citizens.</i>

63
00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:15,067
<i>Stay indoors with windows
and exits closed.</i>

64
00:10:15,069 --> 00:10:17,670
<i>In order to avoid
any exposure to the ash.</i>

65
00:10:17,672 --> 00:10:20,006
<i>Report all females
to the nearest accord.</i>

66
00:10:24,278 --> 00:10:26,912
Stay close.

67
00:10:28,282 --> 00:10:29,749
Don't say anything.

68
00:10:33,354 --> 00:10:35,421
You look ridiculous, by the way.

69
00:10:55,109 --> 00:10:57,076
Come on, come on, come on.

70
00:10:57,078 --> 00:10:59,078
How many MREs
do we have right now?

71
00:11:09,691 --> 00:11:10,923
Let's go.

72
00:11:16,764 --> 00:11:18,431
We'll need, uh, coffee.

73
00:11:53,034 --> 00:11:54,100
Hey!

74
00:11:57,171 --> 00:11:59,739
Get on the ground.
Get down on the ground.

75
00:12:01,109 --> 00:12:03,149
Get down on the ground.
All the way!

76
00:12:04,445 --> 00:12:05,945
Face down. Eyes down.

77
00:12:07,982 --> 00:12:09,315
Are you all right?

78
00:12:12,887 --> 00:12:15,187
Who else is working today
in the store?

79
00:12:15,189 --> 00:12:16,639
Just me. I'm the owner.

80
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,090
Don't you lie to me.
- I'm not.

81
00:12:18,092 --> 00:12:19,492
- And what did you see?
- What?

82
00:12:24,398 --> 00:12:26,332
What did you see?

83
00:12:26,334 --> 00:12:28,000
Nothing. Nobody came in.

84
00:12:34,909 --> 00:12:36,275
This is what we're gonna do.

85
00:12:37,111 --> 00:12:39,278
Take out $40.

86
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:41,280
We will pay you
for these groceries.

87
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:45,017
And we are leaving this store.

88
00:12:48,222 --> 00:12:50,422
You lay there and you count.

89
00:12:50,424 --> 00:12:52,958
Backwards from 500.
And don't you move.

90
00:12:57,098 --> 00:12:58,497
Eva, let's go.

91
00:13:26,194 --> 00:13:27,993
<i>But before
we get to all of that,</i>

92
00:13:27,995 --> 00:13:29,995
<i>we wanted to
kick off today's show</i>

93
00:13:29,997 --> 00:13:31,931
<i>with a bit of cosmic news.</i>

94
00:13:31,933 --> 00:13:33,916
<i>NASA just announced</i>

95
00:13:33,917 --> 00:13:35,900
<i>that we should all be</i>
<i>in for quite a show</i>
<i>over the weekend.</i>

96
00:13:35,903 --> 00:13:39,405
<i>Cavino's Comet will be taking</i>
<i>its rare journey</i>
<i>close to Earth...</i>

97
00:13:39,407 --> 00:13:41,247
Carolyn, I'm out of here.
I'll see you later.

98
00:14:02,063 --> 00:14:04,630
- Hey, girl.
- Hey.

99
00:14:04,632 --> 00:14:06,899
Did you get my text
about the yoga class?

100
00:14:06,901 --> 00:14:08,167
Are you coming with me?

101
00:14:08,169 --> 00:14:10,269
You know what,

102
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:12,370
I'm not really sure
if I wanna roast myself
at 100 degrees,

103
00:14:12,373 --> 00:14:15,040
- so you're on your own.

104
00:14:15,042 --> 00:14:16,108
I'm going out
with the girls tonight,

105
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:17,576
so you guys have
a bit of privacy.

106
00:14:17,578 --> 00:14:21,080
You don't have to do that.
You know that, right?

107
00:14:21,082 --> 00:14:22,581
No, no, no,
the place is all yours.

108
00:14:22,583 --> 00:14:24,450
So, uh, you guys
can do it everywhere.

109
00:14:24,452 --> 00:14:26,619
On the couch, in the kitchen.

110
00:14:26,621 --> 00:14:29,488
Just not on that table
'cause my granny bought me that.

111
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:31,891
- What, this table?
- Yeah, that table.

112
00:14:31,893 --> 00:14:33,425
It seems pretty strong to me.

113
00:14:33,427 --> 00:14:34,927
Don't touch it.

114
00:14:34,929 --> 00:14:36,495
I'm not playing.

115
00:14:36,497 --> 00:14:39,064
- Yeah, no, close them.
Not on the table.

116
00:14:39,066 --> 00:14:41,934
I did buy you
a bottle of champagne.
It's in the fridge.

117
00:14:41,936 --> 00:14:43,402
- Your favorite bottle.
- I love you.

118
00:14:43,404 --> 00:14:45,504
I love you, too.

119
00:14:45,506 --> 00:14:47,506
- I'm so excited for you.
- Oh, my God!

120
00:14:54,348 --> 00:14:57,082
I sleep so much better
when I sleep next to you.

121
00:15:02,423 --> 00:15:04,023
Can we plan a trip?

122
00:15:06,294 --> 00:15:07,927
Where you wanna go?

123
00:15:07,929 --> 00:15:10,362
Uh, a waterfall.

124
00:15:10,364 --> 00:15:13,432
You know, we haven't
been there in years.

125
00:15:13,434 --> 00:15:14,500
I'd love that.

126
00:15:26,547 --> 00:15:28,013
<i>I love you.</i>

127
00:15:28,015 --> 00:15:30,015
<i>I love you, too.</i>

128
00:15:30,685 --> 00:15:32,551
- Hey.
- Hey.

129
00:15:32,553 --> 00:15:34,119
You're cooking.

130
00:15:34,121 --> 00:15:36,588
Well, what's cooking?

131
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:38,310
- Want some?
- Mmm-hmm.

132
00:15:38,726 --> 00:15:39,992
Mmm.

133
00:15:43,064 --> 00:15:45,230
Okay, just a little bit.
Just a little bit more.

134
00:15:45,232 --> 00:15:46,398
- Okay.
- Okay.

135
00:15:47,635 --> 00:15:49,501
Okay.

136
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:53,272
Because of your fantastic
moving abilities,

137
00:15:53,274 --> 00:15:56,342
I want you to sit right here
for a second.

138
00:15:56,978 --> 00:15:58,344
Okay.

139
00:15:58,346 --> 00:16:00,196
Why?

140
00:16:00,197 --> 00:16:02,047
I have a surprise for you.
Close your eyes, please.

141
00:16:02,049 --> 00:16:04,049
- Close your eyes.
- Okay, okay, okay.

142
00:16:05,086 --> 00:16:06,719
I like surprises.
How did you do it?

143
00:16:06,721 --> 00:16:08,120
- What is it?

144
00:16:08,122 --> 00:16:09,254
What is it?

145
00:16:09,256 --> 00:16:11,423
Ready? Can I open my eyes?
Right now?

146
00:16:16,697 --> 00:16:17,763
Now.

147
00:16:21,268 --> 00:16:22,368
Okay.

148
00:16:26,107 --> 00:16:28,140
Who are these cute little guys?

149
00:16:28,142 --> 00:16:30,209
- That's us.
- That's us?

150
00:16:31,178 --> 00:16:33,579
Okay, you remember
the road trip?

151
00:16:33,581 --> 00:16:35,781
We stopped
at the weird rest stop.

152
00:16:35,783 --> 00:16:37,416
Oh, my God.

153
00:16:37,417 --> 00:16:39,050
-We'll drive there,
we'll drive there again.
-Yeah, we tried on,

154
00:16:39,053 --> 00:16:41,387
- um, those plushie hats.
- Oh, my God, yeah.

155
00:16:41,389 --> 00:16:42,788
And I was the bison...

156
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:45,090
- I was the owl.
- Right.

157
00:16:45,092 --> 00:16:47,259
Oh. You remembered.

158
00:16:47,261 --> 00:16:50,529
That was the trip
we decided to move in together.

159
00:16:50,531 --> 00:16:53,499
<i>♪ Lay your trust</i>

160
00:16:53,501 --> 00:16:57,569
<i>♪ Lay it all on me</i>

161
00:17:12,453 --> 00:17:14,119
What's that?

162
00:17:14,121 --> 00:17:15,354
I don't know.

163
00:17:19,293 --> 00:17:20,492
What's this? Is this...

164
00:17:21,295 --> 00:17:22,461
You think it's snowing?

165
00:17:24,098 --> 00:17:26,065
No, it doesn't look like snow.

166
00:17:30,771 --> 00:17:32,805
Carolyn, is that you?

167
00:17:32,807 --> 00:17:35,340
- Yeah.
- Are you seeing this?

168
00:17:35,342 --> 00:17:36,809
What?

169
00:17:37,545 --> 00:17:38,811
Outside.

170
00:17:38,813 --> 00:17:40,079
You're covered in it.

171
00:17:45,753 --> 00:17:46,819
You okay?

172
00:17:51,592 --> 00:17:52,724
Hey.

173
00:17:55,663 --> 00:17:56,903
We'll stay here for the night.

174
00:18:06,707 --> 00:18:07,873
Just in case.

175
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:25,290
- Hey.
- Yo, buddy.

176
00:18:30,731 --> 00:18:32,231
Hey there, sugar.

177
00:18:33,567 --> 00:18:36,435
How about a little bit
of sugar tonight, huh?

178
00:18:38,506 --> 00:18:39,638
Oh.

179
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,874
Soft-spoken.

180
00:18:41,876 --> 00:18:43,575
I can be gentle, you know.

181
00:18:43,577 --> 00:18:46,378
Okay. Oh.

182
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:49,882
Not everybody's ready.
I get it.

183
00:18:49,884 --> 00:18:52,184
But in case
you change your mind,

184
00:18:52,186 --> 00:18:53,452
I'm in 181.

185
00:18:54,321 --> 00:18:55,487
Just, um,

186
00:18:57,224 --> 00:18:58,390
come on by.

187
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:04,196
Hello, boys.

188
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:07,266
Interested in some sugar?

189
00:19:08,502 --> 00:19:11,203
Ah. Yoo-hoo!

190
00:19:11,205 --> 00:19:14,373
- Hello, boys.
- Get your bag. Let's go.

191
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:16,875
Oh, looks like
we got ourselves a first-timer.

192
00:19:16,877 --> 00:19:19,244
- Hey! Get inside.
- What's your name?

193
00:19:19,914 --> 00:19:21,246
Fuck off, tranny.

194
00:19:23,684 --> 00:19:24,750
Fuck you.

195
00:19:31,659 --> 00:19:32,891
You okay?

196
00:19:37,531 --> 00:19:38,597
Classy.

197
00:19:39,633 --> 00:19:40,832
Yeah.

198
00:19:44,538 --> 00:19:46,438
- Okay.

199
00:22:23,564 --> 00:22:24,996
Looks pretty empty.

200
00:22:26,033 --> 00:22:27,099
Two?

201
00:22:28,769 --> 00:22:29,935
I don't know.

202
00:22:31,538 --> 00:22:32,904
Seems like a dumb risk.

203
00:22:34,408 --> 00:22:35,974
Pancakes.

204
00:22:35,976 --> 00:22:37,976
Mmm. Bacon.

205
00:22:40,414 --> 00:22:41,747
Shall we order to go?

206
00:22:43,817 --> 00:22:46,585
You want my last cooked meal
to be to go?

207
00:22:47,755 --> 00:22:49,020
Hmm.

208
00:23:06,774 --> 00:23:09,107
<i>It was not he who disobeyed,</i>

209
00:23:09,109 --> 00:23:11,476
<i>it was she.</i>

210
00:23:11,478 --> 00:23:14,613
<i>And now we see
that the Lord taketh.</i>

211
00:23:14,615 --> 00:23:17,082
<i>He brought the ash from heavens</i>

212
00:23:17,084 --> 00:23:18,950
<i>to punish us and remind us</i>

213
00:23:18,952 --> 00:23:21,453
<i>that you cannot
keep living in sin,</i>

214
00:23:21,455 --> 00:23:23,755
<i>this sin.</i>

215
00:23:23,757 --> 00:23:26,124
<i>We cannot keep living
without His words</i>

216
00:23:26,126 --> 00:23:29,127
<i>to guide us and remind us</i>

217
00:23:29,129 --> 00:23:31,797
<i>who God made in His image.</i>

218
00:23:31,799 --> 00:23:33,665
Need a minute?

219
00:23:33,667 --> 00:23:37,068
Nah, I'll take
two specials, thanks.

220
00:23:37,971 --> 00:23:39,771
We ain't got any eggs.

221
00:23:40,641 --> 00:23:41,706
We know.

222
00:23:44,511 --> 00:23:47,579
<i>Now you see</i>
<i>what I've been</i>
<i>trying to tell you.</i>

223
00:23:49,483 --> 00:23:52,050
<i>There was a tiny glimmer of hope</i>

224
00:23:52,052 --> 00:23:53,952
<i>that came out
of Washington today.</i>

225
00:23:53,954 --> 00:23:57,189
<i>Scientists at the U.S. Center
for Rebirth and Repopulation</i>

226
00:23:57,191 --> 00:24:00,559
<i>called a press conference
with some promising news.</i>

227
00:24:00,561 --> 00:24:02,994
<i>This experiment,
dubbed The Embryo Project,</i>

228
00:24:02,996 --> 00:24:05,230
<i>reached a historical milestone.</i>

229
00:24:05,232 --> 00:24:08,967
<i>Latest trials saw</i>
<i>the fetus survive</i>
<i>to the second trimester,</i>

230
00:24:08,969 --> 00:24:11,736
<i>a first in
artificial womb technology.</i>

231
00:24:11,738 --> 00:24:14,473
<i>Many world leaders</i>
<i>publicly praised</i>
<i>their achievement</i>

232
00:24:14,475 --> 00:24:16,174
<i>as this has widely been seen</i>

233
00:24:16,176 --> 00:24:18,777
<i>as a possible method
of repopulation</i>

234
00:24:18,779 --> 00:24:22,681
<i>once the cure to HNV21
has been found.</i>

235
00:24:22,683 --> 00:24:25,951
<i>It appears that the ads</i>
<i>being run from</i>
<i>the past few weeks</i>

236
00:24:25,953 --> 00:24:27,152
<i>may be nothing, but...</i>

237
00:24:27,154 --> 00:24:28,220
Here you go.

238
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,125
Looks great, thanks.

239
00:24:41,235 --> 00:24:44,686
Mmm.

240
00:24:44,687 --> 00:24:48,138
Now, isn't it better than
your gourmet canned ravioli?

241
00:24:49,910 --> 00:24:51,109
Yeah.

242
00:25:20,641 --> 00:25:22,140
Sit anywhere you like.

243
00:25:32,252 --> 00:25:35,987
What's he saying?
Bobby, turn it up, won't you?

244
00:25:35,989 --> 00:25:40,025
Can't hear a damn thing.

245
00:25:40,027 --> 00:25:43,128
<i>Doctors' plea,</i>
<i>the Department of Health</i>
<i>and Human Services</i>

246
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:46,097
<i>was quick to</i>
<i>announce an increase</i>
<i>in the federal reward</i>

247
00:25:46,099 --> 00:25:48,733
<i>for the successful reporting
or locating</i>

248
00:25:48,735 --> 00:25:51,453
<i>of live American females.</i>

249
00:25:51,454 --> 00:25:54,172
<i>The House and Senate</i>
<i>unanimously approved</i>
<i>an increase in reward</i>

250
00:25:54,174 --> 00:25:56,608
<i>- from one million
to two million dollars...</i>

251
00:25:56,610 --> 00:26:01,880
<i>- in their hopes that...</i>
- Two million bucks. Bullshit!

252
00:26:01,882 --> 00:26:05,083
Whoa!
You don't reckon
they don't pay?

253
00:26:05,085 --> 00:26:08,653
You tell me you'd
turn in your wife and daughter
for two million bucks.

254
00:26:08,655 --> 00:26:10,956
Not my daughter.

255
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,960
You know what
they do to 'em, don't you?

256
00:26:14,962 --> 00:26:17,195
Eh, they're like staying safe.

257
00:26:20,367 --> 00:26:23,368
Don't tell me
you ordered two eggs here.

258
00:26:23,370 --> 00:26:27,839
They're doing
a damn science experiment,
a human-chick combine.

259
00:26:27,841 --> 00:26:28,940
You guys doing okay?

260
00:26:30,043 --> 00:26:31,643
Yeah. Thanks.

261
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:36,781
-Want me to
top those off for you?
-Sure. Yeah.

262
00:26:42,723 --> 00:26:44,789
Get you guys anything else?

263
00:26:44,791 --> 00:26:48,259
We'll take
two slices of pie to go
and the check, please.

264
00:26:52,232 --> 00:26:53,732
You got it.

265
00:26:57,137 --> 00:26:58,336
Let's get out of here now.

266
00:27:04,645 --> 00:27:05,877
Eva.

267
00:27:19,192 --> 00:27:21,793
Son of a bitch!

268
00:27:21,795 --> 00:27:23,361
Hey, I'll take the check.

269
00:27:27,067 --> 00:27:28,733
You know those boys?

270
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:31,269
No.

271
00:27:31,271 --> 00:27:34,706
I don't know those boys at all.

272
00:27:37,678 --> 00:27:39,277
Finish up. Time to go.

273
00:27:53,326 --> 00:27:54,926
Are you all right?

274
00:27:57,864 --> 00:27:59,330
Hey.

275
00:27:59,332 --> 00:28:02,300
- It's fine. I'm fine.
- It's not fine.

276
00:28:02,302 --> 00:28:05,437
You and I
both know how this goes.
Day one is hemorrhaging.

277
00:28:05,439 --> 00:28:08,840
Day two is dizziness
and loss of motor control.

278
00:28:08,842 --> 00:28:11,142
- Just pull the car over.
- Day four is seizures

279
00:28:11,144 --> 00:28:13,244
-and convulsions
if you make it that far.
-Just pull over.

280
00:28:13,246 --> 00:28:15,213
- Day six.
- Just pull the car over!

281
00:28:18,318 --> 00:28:20,218
Eva, wait a se...

282
00:28:22,322 --> 00:28:23,388
Eva!

283
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:18,510
Give me the keys.

284
00:29:56,516 --> 00:29:57,849
Hey.

285
00:29:59,085 --> 00:30:00,251
What?

286
00:30:00,253 --> 00:30:03,354
Glad we're finally
doing this, but...

287
00:30:10,063 --> 00:30:12,330
- I just don't understand...
- Stop.

288
00:30:13,433 --> 00:30:14,866
It's done.

289
00:30:22,342 --> 00:30:24,609
Let's try and enjoy this. Okay?

290
00:30:35,522 --> 00:30:39,090
Come on.
Let's go find our waterfall.

291
00:30:54,274 --> 00:30:56,140
She fell and bumped her head.

292
00:30:59,012 --> 00:31:00,612
Got her?

293
00:31:00,614 --> 00:31:03,915
I'll fill the forms, yeah.

294
00:32:17,090 --> 00:32:18,222
Hey.

295
00:32:19,092 --> 00:32:20,325
Let's go.

296
00:32:20,327 --> 00:32:24,195
What... What do you...
What's happening?

297
00:32:24,197 --> 00:32:26,597
- Would you just talk to me?
- We've got to get you home.

298
00:32:28,234 --> 00:32:31,154
There's got to be
a covered path
to the garage.

299
00:32:35,976 --> 00:32:38,326
Hey.

300
00:32:38,327 --> 00:32:40,677
Just talk to me.
Tell me what's happening, Will.

301
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:43,381
We'll talk in the car.

302
00:32:43,383 --> 00:32:46,751
Will, I'm not leaving till we
hear about Carolyn, okay?

303
00:32:48,054 --> 00:32:51,289
We've done all we can
for Carolyn.

304
00:32:51,291 --> 00:32:54,525
-Right now,
I'm thinking about you.
-I'm fine.

305
00:33:00,233 --> 00:33:01,599
It's only women.

306
00:33:03,269 --> 00:33:04,702
Let's go.

307
00:33:23,456 --> 00:33:25,256
What are you doing?

308
00:33:39,539 --> 00:33:41,272
<i>I've been calling you.</i>

309
00:33:41,274 --> 00:33:43,074
<i>What is going on?</i>

310
00:33:43,076 --> 00:33:44,559
<i>We don't know yet.</i>

311
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:46,043
<i>We've never seen
anything like this before.</i>

312
00:33:46,046 --> 00:33:47,678
<i>And Mom, how is she?</i>

313
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:49,180
<i>Mother is fine.</i>

314
00:33:49,182 --> 00:33:51,716
<i>I got her to quarantine
as soon as it started.</i>

315
00:33:51,718 --> 00:33:55,353
<i>The quarantine?</i>
<i>I've been trying</i>
<i>to reach a friend at the CDC</i>

316
00:33:55,355 --> 00:33:58,122
<i>but so far, I can't control...</i>

317
00:33:58,124 --> 00:34:00,725
<i>So where do we go?
What do we do?</i>

318
00:34:00,727 --> 00:34:04,295
<i>You have to
follow my instructions exactly.</i>

319
00:35:47,233 --> 00:35:48,699
Are you still doing that?

320
00:35:52,238 --> 00:35:53,304
Doing what?

321
00:35:55,241 --> 00:35:57,441
That. Who's gonna see them?

322
00:36:01,481 --> 00:36:06,250
You don't think there is
any other woman
in this entire world?

323
00:36:08,555 --> 00:36:09,954
I don't know.

324
00:36:19,866 --> 00:36:21,465
I'm not that special.

325
00:37:40,013 --> 00:37:41,279
Will?

326
00:37:42,448 --> 00:37:43,514
Yeah?

327
00:37:45,418 --> 00:37:47,485
Can you please
help me with this?

328
00:37:48,721 --> 00:37:50,354
Yeah, of course.

329
00:37:52,558 --> 00:37:53,758
Tell me.

330
00:37:54,994 --> 00:37:58,062
Um, help me...

331
00:37:58,064 --> 00:38:00,298
Be careful.

332
00:38:12,712 --> 00:38:13,778
Okay.

333
00:38:38,071 --> 00:38:39,670
Okay.

334
00:40:17,437 --> 00:40:19,170
How long have I been out for?

335
00:40:19,172 --> 00:40:22,573
Gotta start
boiling the water now.

336
00:40:22,575 --> 00:40:25,176
They say it's entered
the water supply, so...

337
00:40:26,712 --> 00:40:28,212
Did you even go to bed?

338
00:40:28,214 --> 00:40:32,783
It looks like canned
and pre-packaged foods
for a while,

339
00:40:32,785 --> 00:40:35,553
but I like ravioli, so...

340
00:40:37,824 --> 00:40:39,664
When did you go to the store?

341
00:40:40,893 --> 00:40:42,593
Soon as it opened.

342
00:40:47,099 --> 00:40:49,733
What's with these lights?

343
00:40:51,671 --> 00:40:53,938
UV lights, baby.

344
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:58,542
They kill pathogens and germs
within a couple feet.

345
00:41:00,713 --> 00:41:03,747
This will be over
in a few weeks,
but till then,

346
00:41:03,749 --> 00:41:05,749
I'm gonna keep you safe.

347
00:41:06,886 --> 00:41:08,486
Got it?

348
00:41:11,524 --> 00:41:12,957
Where's the phone?

349
00:41:12,959 --> 00:41:15,693
- Where's the phone?
- Um, it's on the coffee table.

350
00:41:15,695 --> 00:41:17,995
Leave it in the bag though.
Don't take it out.

351
00:41:19,565 --> 00:41:20,865
It's safer.

352
00:41:23,736 --> 00:41:25,102
Hello?

353
00:41:26,639 --> 00:41:28,739
Mmm-hmm.
This is she.

354
00:41:32,245 --> 00:41:35,145
Yes. Yes, yes.
That's correct.

355
00:41:39,185 --> 00:41:41,018
I'm sorry, could you
please slow down?

356
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:43,554
I can't understand
what you're saying.

357
00:41:49,228 --> 00:41:51,061
What do you mean?

358
00:41:52,164 --> 00:41:54,064
Babe, what happened?

359
00:41:56,536 --> 00:41:57,902
What?

360
00:42:15,087 --> 00:42:18,656
<i>It's been 48 hours</i>
<i>since the mysterious ash</i>
<i>began to fall</i>

361
00:42:18,658 --> 00:42:23,994
<i>throughout parts of the world</i>
<i>and little is still known</i>
<i>about the pathogen HNV 21</i>

362
00:42:23,996 --> 00:42:28,065
<i>present in the debris</i>
<i>that has now killed</i>
<i>thousands of females</i>

363
00:42:28,067 --> 00:42:30,134
<i>and infected millions more.</i>

364
00:42:30,136 --> 00:42:33,604
<i>International flights</i>
<i>have been grounded</i>
<i>in every major airport</i>

365
00:42:33,606 --> 00:42:37,608
<i>as authorities struggle</i>
<i>to contain the spread</i>
<i>of this disease.</i>

366
00:42:39,211 --> 00:42:41,845
<i>Doctors have now verified
trace amounts of the virus</i>

367
00:42:41,847 --> 00:42:44,949
<i>in at least a dozen</i>
<i>human males in hospitals</i>
<i>around the country.</i>

368
00:42:44,951 --> 00:42:47,351
<i>While none of the male patients
displayed symptoms,</i>

369
00:42:47,353 --> 00:42:50,988
<i>authorities are now cautioning</i>
<i>all males to avoid</i>
<i>any physical contact</i>

370
00:42:50,990 --> 00:42:52,756
<i>with uninfected females.</i>

371
00:43:00,032 --> 00:43:01,899
<i>Will, take care of her, okay?</i>

372
00:43:01,901 --> 00:43:03,935
- Good to talk to you.
<i>- We love you.</i>

373
00:43:03,936 --> 00:43:05,970
- Bye. Love you.
Love you, Mom.
<i>Please be safe.</i>

374
00:43:15,748 --> 00:43:17,881
- Want some ravioli?
- Sure.

375
00:43:35,701 --> 00:43:37,368
Move! Move!

376
00:43:37,370 --> 00:43:39,336
Shh! Shh! Shh!

377
00:43:49,649 --> 00:43:51,015
- Got it.
- You got it?

378
00:43:52,718 --> 00:43:55,653
The pulley is here
but the vent is to the right?

379
00:43:55,655 --> 00:43:57,471
Yeah.

380
00:43:57,472 --> 00:43:59,288
<i>The President
appears to be visiting women</i>

381
00:43:59,291 --> 00:44:02,726
<i>held in official
government captivity.</i>

382
00:44:02,728 --> 00:44:04,762
<i>The women are shown to be
happy and healthy,</i>

383
00:44:04,764 --> 00:44:09,099
<i>as they urge other women</i>
<i>to come forward and ensure</i>
<i>the future of America.</i>

384
00:44:15,408 --> 00:44:17,174
<i>You shouldn't be
taking pictures like that.</i>

385
00:44:17,176 --> 00:44:20,077
You're in front of the window,
it's not safe.

386
00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:21,412
Eva, come on.

387
00:44:21,414 --> 00:44:23,380
Give me the camera.

388
00:44:25,918 --> 00:44:29,053
Do you smell that?
That's like just
Lysol everywhere.

389
00:44:29,055 --> 00:44:30,688
Do you smell that?

390
00:44:30,690 --> 00:44:32,990
No.
- No, but you keep going out.

391
00:44:35,695 --> 00:44:38,696
I'm sorry, I know
it's not your fault.

392
00:45:01,253 --> 00:45:02,986
<i>Is this really
what I think it is?</i>

393
00:45:09,195 --> 00:45:11,895
<i>Got it.
No personal information.</i>

394
00:45:11,897 --> 00:45:15,299
<i>Riots and looting</i>
<i>continue in the streets</i>
<i>of London, Paris,</i>

395
00:45:15,301 --> 00:45:18,769
<i>Barcelona and Rome</i>
<i>as the general</i>
<i>surviving population</i>

396
00:45:18,771 --> 00:45:20,504
<i>seems to be turning to anarchy.</i>

397
00:45:22,074 --> 00:45:24,408
- What are you looking for?
- Where's the phone?

398
00:45:24,410 --> 00:45:28,378
-We're not using
the phone anymore.
-Why?

399
00:45:28,380 --> 00:45:31,849
I read some of the messages,
and all I'm saying is that...

400
00:45:31,851 --> 00:45:33,417
-Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
What did you do?
-Listen,

401
00:45:33,419 --> 00:45:35,786
- all I'm saying is that...
- What did you do?

402
00:45:35,788 --> 00:45:37,788
-Why are you going
through my phone?
-There's information

403
00:45:37,789 --> 00:45:39,789
that you are
giving out there, Eva,
that you should not...

404
00:45:39,792 --> 00:45:41,792
Why are you
going through my phone?

405
00:45:43,129 --> 00:45:46,230
<i>At least</i>
<i>a dozen explosive devices</i>
<i>rocked the offices</i>

406
00:45:46,232 --> 00:45:50,434
<i>and labs of the Embryo Project
late last night in Washington.</i>

407
00:45:50,436 --> 00:45:54,138
<i>Terrorist group Via Natura
quickly claimed responsibility</i>

408
00:45:54,140 --> 00:45:58,041
<i>justifying their action as
defending God's work.</i>

409
00:45:58,043 --> 00:46:01,812
<i>Honestly,</i>
<i>the hardest part</i>
<i>is feeling helpless.</i>

410
00:46:01,814 --> 00:46:04,381
I don't want to be
the policeman.

411
00:46:04,383 --> 00:46:07,050
I don't want to have to
tell you what you have
to do anymore.

412
00:46:07,052 --> 00:46:09,787
You know what you have to do.
So you do it.

413
00:46:09,789 --> 00:46:14,024
Your dad was very clear with us.
He told us the things
that we had to do

414
00:46:14,026 --> 00:46:16,426
every single morning,
which we have to do
every single day,

415
00:46:16,428 --> 00:46:17,928
when I come back from the store,

416
00:46:17,930 --> 00:46:20,080
when I come back from my site,

417
00:46:20,081 --> 00:46:22,231
We don't know
what I'm bringing in.
We don't know.

418
00:46:22,234 --> 00:46:24,802
<i>I'm not sure
how else to report this.</i>

419
00:46:24,804 --> 00:46:28,238
<i>The death toll has clipped</i>
<i>ten million females</i>
<i>today worldwide.</i>

420
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:31,942
<i>This officially makes HNV 21
the fastest</i>

421
00:46:31,944 --> 00:46:33,877
<i>and deadliest epidemic
in modern history.</i>

422
00:46:33,879 --> 00:46:36,280
<i>But we're definitely
not the last ones.</i>

423
00:46:36,282 --> 00:46:39,016
<i>My mother is still
safe in England.</i>

424
00:46:39,018 --> 00:46:41,418
<i>Hang in there, ladies.</i>

425
00:46:41,420 --> 00:46:44,388
How hard is it?
When you come out,

426
00:46:44,390 --> 00:46:46,390
you zip the thing up,
you wash your hands.

427
00:46:46,392 --> 00:46:49,059
How difficult is that, really?

428
00:46:49,061 --> 00:46:51,395
<i>I know he is
doing this all for me,</i>

429
00:46:51,397 --> 00:46:56,900
<i>but he is different now.
We're different now.</i>

430
00:46:56,902 --> 00:46:59,870
Do I just sound
like an ungrateful bitch?

431
00:46:59,872 --> 00:47:03,140
-You don't see...
-Give me the rules again.
Just give me the rules!

432
00:47:03,142 --> 00:47:05,409
Just give me the rules, okay?
Just give me the rules.

433
00:47:05,411 --> 00:47:08,512
No calls, no contact
with the outside world...

434
00:47:08,514 --> 00:47:12,216
<i>I don't want</i>
<i>to control you,</i>
<i>I'm trying to protect you.</i>

435
00:47:12,218 --> 00:47:14,518
<i>Don't you</i>
<i>fucking touch me.</i>
<i>What have you done?</i>

436
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:11,642
Don't lag so far behind.
I won't be able to
save you from the bear.

437
00:48:13,379 --> 00:48:15,412
Bear, huh?

438
00:48:21,553 --> 00:48:24,273
You need help?
You want me
to carry you?

439
00:49:30,522 --> 00:49:31,755
Got something for you.

440
00:49:33,459 --> 00:49:34,524
<i>What?</i>

441
00:49:37,629 --> 00:49:38,996
<i>What is it?</i>

442
00:49:46,505 --> 00:49:48,105
Oh, yeah!

443
00:50:01,620 --> 00:50:04,287
Mmm! That's good.

444
00:50:20,506 --> 00:50:22,172
You wanna shoot somethin'?

445
00:50:39,725 --> 00:50:41,191
Are you sure this
is what the map says?

446
00:50:41,193 --> 00:50:42,259
I'm sure.

447
00:50:49,268 --> 00:50:50,700
Ah!

448
00:50:50,702 --> 00:50:52,402
I told your mother
we should have sold

449
00:50:52,404 --> 00:50:53,804
this piece of junk.

450
00:51:03,549 --> 00:51:05,509
She was a better driver
than you.

451
00:51:14,726 --> 00:51:16,526
You know what you're doing?

452
00:51:18,330 --> 00:51:19,410
How hard could it be?

453
00:51:20,432 --> 00:51:22,332
Oh. Okay.

454
00:51:24,236 --> 00:51:26,503
- Back far enough? Okay.
- Oh! Don't worry.

455
00:51:29,274 --> 00:51:30,540
One...

456
00:51:31,410 --> 00:51:32,676
Two...

457
00:51:39,785 --> 00:51:41,551
Safety's on.

458
00:51:42,254 --> 00:51:44,454
- Oh, boy.

459
00:51:44,823 --> 00:51:47,557
Okay. One...

460
00:51:48,660 --> 00:51:50,193
Two...

461
00:51:54,433 --> 00:51:56,433
Going again.
My stance was...

462
00:51:56,435 --> 00:51:58,468
Gotta relax
my shoulders. Okay!

463
00:52:03,742 --> 00:52:05,408
Damn.

464
00:52:10,282 --> 00:52:11,815
All right, you wanna try?

465
00:52:11,817 --> 00:52:13,783
You try. Come on.

466
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:15,785
Okay.

467
00:52:33,805 --> 00:52:35,238
Is that it?

468
00:52:36,575 --> 00:52:38,308
Yeah, that's the one.

469
00:52:39,411 --> 00:52:41,444
Put it back here.

470
00:52:41,446 --> 00:52:42,812
Safety's on.

471
00:52:42,814 --> 00:52:44,681
Hold it like this... Okay.

472
00:52:45,417 --> 00:52:47,250
Here we go.

473
00:52:50,856 --> 00:52:52,389
Oh!

474
00:52:52,391 --> 00:52:54,524
Did you see that?
- No way!

475
00:52:54,526 --> 00:52:56,860
Did you see that?

476
00:52:56,862 --> 00:52:58,361
- Be careful with that thing.
- Okay. Okay.

477
00:52:58,363 --> 00:53:00,697
I know you did it but try again.

478
00:53:00,699 --> 00:53:02,619
- Yeah, yeah. Try again.
- Okay.

479
00:53:25,224 --> 00:53:26,923
Hey! Go girl!

480
00:53:27,459 --> 00:53:28,825
Uh!

481
00:53:29,761 --> 00:53:30,994
Ay!

482
00:53:33,232 --> 00:53:34,664
Ahhh!

483
00:53:35,867 --> 00:53:38,935
We're like what cavemen
did back in the day.

484
00:53:38,937 --> 00:53:41,938
I grab her, and drag her.

485
00:53:45,911 --> 00:53:49,646
Don't joke.
- You had such good aim.

486
00:53:49,648 --> 00:53:52,582
- And you suck!
- You had such good aim,

487
00:53:52,584 --> 00:53:54,684
earlier tonight.

488
00:53:54,686 --> 00:53:57,454
Where is it all gone?

489
00:53:57,456 --> 00:53:59,256
Where is it all gone?

490
00:54:02,261 --> 00:54:03,994
I'll see you in a bit.

491
00:54:03,996 --> 00:54:06,029
Mmm. Feels so good.

492
00:54:59,351 --> 00:55:02,085
Eva. Eva!

493
00:55:03,322 --> 00:55:04,754
I got you, baby.
Come on.

494
00:55:04,756 --> 00:55:07,023
You'll be okay.

495
00:55:43,028 --> 00:55:45,362
A little late
to the party, ain't you, son?

496
00:55:47,599 --> 00:55:50,500
Sold my last 320 Swift
about a week ago.

497
00:55:50,502 --> 00:55:52,402
Let's see what we got here.

498
00:55:53,672 --> 00:55:56,406
So, you wanna
be accurate but not lethal?

499
00:55:57,476 --> 00:55:58,641
You hit 'em in the ovaries,

500
00:55:58,643 --> 00:56:00,043
you ain't getting
nothing for 'em.

501
00:56:00,045 --> 00:56:01,544
How about this?

502
00:56:02,614 --> 00:56:05,749
No, I'm looking
for something smaller.

503
00:56:05,751 --> 00:56:07,817
A hand gun
or something like that.

504
00:56:09,955 --> 00:56:12,489
You know, you don't have
to play coy with me, son.

505
00:56:13,458 --> 00:56:15,658
There's a tool for every job,

506
00:56:15,660 --> 00:56:18,695
you just gotta make sure
you got the right one.

507
00:56:18,697 --> 00:56:21,097
- This one.
- Hmm.

508
00:56:21,099 --> 00:56:23,139
You ain't ever
hunted before, have you?

509
00:56:25,170 --> 00:56:27,003
Looking for self-defense.

510
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:30,840
Yeah, well, I'll say
whatever you want.

511
00:57:51,089 --> 00:57:53,156
You realize
I'm still alive, right?

512
00:57:54,793 --> 00:57:56,192
I'm gonna take it.

513
00:58:01,233 --> 00:58:02,899
I'm tired of this too.

514
00:58:05,036 --> 00:58:07,003
I can't even touch you.

515
00:58:09,875 --> 00:58:11,908
Take the test.

516
00:58:11,910 --> 00:58:15,011
If I'm not a carrier,
then maybe we can...

517
00:58:21,686 --> 00:58:23,186
Thought it was worth a try.

518
00:58:43,174 --> 00:58:44,974
"Open the medically sealed swabs

519
00:58:44,976 --> 00:58:47,610
"and remove one swab
from the sealed packaging."

520
00:58:53,752 --> 00:58:55,151
Mmm?

521
00:59:01,693 --> 00:59:03,660
"If the solution
remains clear,
you are negative.

522
00:59:03,662 --> 00:59:05,595
"If the solution turns indigo,

523
00:59:05,597 --> 00:59:07,931
"you must seek
immediate medical attention."

524
00:59:07,933 --> 00:59:11,834
Okay, so...
Clear-good,
indigo-bad.

525
00:59:47,772 --> 00:59:49,305
At least you're safe.

526
00:59:53,712 --> 00:59:55,645
Yeah, but you're sick.

527
00:59:55,647 --> 00:59:56,846
Will, you have it.

528
00:59:56,848 --> 00:59:59,015
I'm a carrier but I'm not sick.

529
01:00:00,819 --> 01:00:02,318
I feel fine.

530
01:00:06,992 --> 01:00:08,358
See...

531
01:00:09,861 --> 01:00:11,361
We're together...

532
01:00:14,699 --> 01:00:16,232
What's so bad?

533
01:00:18,269 --> 01:00:20,103
And that's enough for you?

534
01:01:43,421 --> 01:01:44,921
Eva.

535
01:01:50,862 --> 01:01:53,496
- Ah!

536
01:02:14,753 --> 01:02:16,152
Eva!

537
01:02:16,154 --> 01:02:17,920
You close?

538
01:02:19,491 --> 01:02:20,990
Good morning.

539
01:02:26,498 --> 01:02:27,764
Who's Eva?

540
01:02:32,070 --> 01:02:34,003
All right.

541
01:02:34,005 --> 01:02:35,845
Get out of there.
Step out.

542
01:02:37,776 --> 01:02:39,242
Stand right out here.

543
01:02:42,247 --> 01:02:44,480
Right there. Right there.

544
01:02:51,923 --> 01:02:53,256
Where is she?

545
01:02:54,893 --> 01:02:57,093
Where is she?

546
01:03:09,274 --> 01:03:11,340
- Don't come back!
- Don't yell.

547
01:03:14,312 --> 01:03:16,179
Over there, see the big tree?

548
01:03:17,549 --> 01:03:19,081
Over there!

549
01:03:20,919 --> 01:03:22,118
Sit down.

550
01:03:29,460 --> 01:03:31,294
Don't get too close, buddy.

551
01:03:43,842 --> 01:03:44,907
Hold your right hand up.

552
01:03:44,909 --> 01:03:46,142
Just like that.

553
01:03:46,511 --> 01:03:47,877
Like that.

554
01:03:53,952 --> 01:03:55,484
Put your hands together.

555
01:03:58,122 --> 01:03:59,555
Where is she?

556
01:04:15,306 --> 01:04:16,572
Is there any sign of her?

557
01:04:18,643 --> 01:04:20,142
She can't be far.

558
01:04:21,179 --> 01:04:22,445
She's sick, man.

559
01:04:24,883 --> 01:04:26,249
Day four...

560
01:04:26,251 --> 01:04:28,317
She won't make it.

561
01:04:34,259 --> 01:04:35,658
We need to split up.

562
01:04:35,660 --> 01:04:37,193
Start looking for her.

563
01:04:37,195 --> 01:04:38,461
- Run, Eva!
- Hey!

564
01:04:38,463 --> 01:04:40,329
I told you...

565
01:04:41,633 --> 01:04:44,300
No yelling.

566
01:05:00,385 --> 01:05:01,517
Double back down the trail.

567
01:05:01,519 --> 01:05:03,252
Make sure we didn't pass her.

568
01:05:03,254 --> 01:05:05,334
I'll head towards the river.
Be careful.

569
01:05:20,471 --> 01:05:21,537
Hey!

570
01:07:27,098 --> 01:07:28,731
She's not coming back.

571
01:07:32,236 --> 01:07:34,737
You hear me talkin' to you.

572
01:07:34,739 --> 01:07:36,819
Keep your voice down.
The boy's asleep.

573
01:07:40,211 --> 01:07:42,078
To hell with your boy!

574
01:07:58,629 --> 01:08:01,397
How did you keep
her safe for so long?

575
01:08:01,399 --> 01:08:03,132
Where have you been hiding?

576
01:08:12,410 --> 01:08:14,643
I tried to do the same
for my wife and...

577
01:08:15,746 --> 01:08:17,626
The basement in our house...

578
01:08:18,749 --> 01:08:20,683
I thought I sealed it,

579
01:08:20,685 --> 01:08:22,384
sterilized it,

580
01:08:25,156 --> 01:08:27,156
but she died after
only a few weeks.

581
01:08:28,392 --> 01:08:30,693
Something my stepson
will never forget.

582
01:08:37,335 --> 01:08:39,768
I'm not a monster.
I want you to know that.

583
01:08:41,672 --> 01:08:44,340
But we have to rebuild.
We have to...

584
01:08:45,543 --> 01:08:47,176
re-populate.

585
01:08:49,847 --> 01:08:52,781
I want my son to have some hope.

586
01:08:52,783 --> 01:08:55,518
Maybe a family
of his own someday.

587
01:08:59,357 --> 01:09:01,317
I promised his mother this much.

588
01:09:03,161 --> 01:09:04,660
She's sick.

589
01:09:04,662 --> 01:09:07,730
That's why we need
to find her soon.

590
01:09:07,732 --> 01:09:11,267
'Cause the eggs,
they don't last more than

591
01:09:11,269 --> 01:09:13,536
six or seven hours after death.

592
01:09:13,538 --> 01:09:14,603
What is...

593
01:09:14,605 --> 01:09:16,525
What is this about?
The money?

594
01:09:19,544 --> 01:09:20,876
I'm a little disappointed
in your gal

595
01:09:20,878 --> 01:09:22,711
for not turning herself in.

596
01:09:25,650 --> 01:09:27,650
Would you have
turned our wife in?

597
01:09:36,427 --> 01:09:37,826
No, you're right.

598
01:09:39,330 --> 01:09:40,729
I wouldn't have.

599
01:09:42,633 --> 01:09:44,767
Cathy,

600
01:09:44,769 --> 01:09:46,809
she would have
gladly turned herself in

601
01:09:47,471 --> 01:09:48,771
it would help.

602
01:10:12,463 --> 01:10:14,423
Hey, buddy.
It's time to wake up.

603
01:10:15,733 --> 01:10:17,333
Shift change.

604
01:11:12,857 --> 01:11:14,456
Oh!

605
01:16:39,183 --> 01:16:40,983
- You okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

606
01:16:40,985 --> 01:16:42,684
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

607
01:16:42,686 --> 01:16:44,152
Okay, okay.

608
01:16:44,154 --> 01:16:45,621
Let's get this off.

609
01:16:54,765 --> 01:16:56,298
Hey! Let's go.

610
01:17:00,971 --> 01:17:02,270
Hey, Case.

611
01:17:04,308 --> 01:17:05,907
Case, you still awake?

612
01:17:12,316 --> 01:17:13,815
Casey!

613
01:17:30,267 --> 01:17:31,967
Go, go, go, go!

614
01:17:31,969 --> 01:17:33,368
I'm okay. I'm okay.

615
01:17:37,808 --> 01:17:40,075
Casey! Casey!

616
01:18:18,248 --> 01:18:21,149
He called a couple
of times on the cell,
but, um...

617
01:18:22,720 --> 01:18:24,352
Five minutes.

618
01:18:24,354 --> 01:18:27,289
We'll set up a secure VPN,
and we'll call him back.

619
01:18:27,291 --> 01:18:29,171
Why, why did he call the phone?

620
01:18:31,261 --> 01:18:33,729
I don't know.
But the VPN's secure.
We'll call him right back.

621
01:18:33,731 --> 01:18:35,297
You guys planned this
whole thing out, right?

622
01:18:35,299 --> 01:18:39,067
To not call the phone,
and he called the phone.

623
01:18:39,069 --> 01:18:42,229
What if it's an emergency,
and what if he's not
by his computer?

624
01:18:43,941 --> 01:18:45,907
Let me just call him, please?

625
01:18:47,878 --> 01:18:49,177
Yeah, okay.

626
01:18:51,749 --> 01:18:53,048
Okay.

627
01:18:55,119 --> 01:18:56,418
Don't say anything.

628
01:18:56,420 --> 01:18:57,519
I know.

629
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:11,833
<i>Eva?</i>

630
01:19:11,835 --> 01:19:14,035
<i>Eva? Are you there?</i>

631
01:19:15,372 --> 01:19:18,473
<i>Is that...
Is that you, Eva?</i>

632
01:19:19,777 --> 01:19:21,443
<i>The screen's black.</i>

633
01:19:25,182 --> 01:19:27,249
<i>I haven't heard from you.</i>

634
01:19:28,352 --> 01:19:30,819
<i>I just want to know,
are you okay?</i>

635
01:19:31,355 --> 01:19:33,121
<i>Are you alive?</i>

636
01:19:39,096 --> 01:19:41,296
Shh.

637
01:19:41,297 --> 01:19:43,497
<i>I... I don't know
what to think anymore.</i>

638
01:19:43,500 --> 01:19:45,260
<i>I don't know what to do.</i>

639
01:19:48,038 --> 01:19:49,938
<i>I thought...</i>

640
01:19:49,940 --> 01:19:52,207
<i>I thought your mother was safe.</i>

641
01:19:55,312 --> 01:19:58,547
<i>There was no need</i>
<i>to take a woman</i>
<i>of her age.</i>

642
01:20:03,387 --> 01:20:04,886
<i>Oh, God!</i>

643
01:20:07,224 --> 01:20:09,457
<i>Eva, I...</i>

644
01:20:09,459 --> 01:20:12,494
<i>I tried my best to stop them.</i>

645
01:20:12,496 --> 01:20:15,564
<i>I, I really tried my best.</i>

646
01:20:16,533 --> 01:20:17,933
<i>But...</i>

647
01:20:20,003 --> 01:20:21,870
<i>They had guns.</i>

648
01:20:24,942 --> 01:20:26,608
<i>I don't know where
they took her.</i>

649
01:20:26,610 --> 01:20:29,144
I don't know.

650
01:20:29,146 --> 01:20:32,247
<i>And I...
Now I want to see you.</i>

651
01:20:32,249 --> 01:20:36,151
<i>I want to see you,</i> beta.
Meri jaan,<i> say something.</i>

652
01:20:36,153 --> 01:20:37,485
Dad, I'm okay!

653
01:20:38,455 --> 01:20:40,121
- What are you doing?
- Eva, no!

654
01:20:40,123 --> 01:20:41,556
- Give me the phone! No!
- You can't... Eva!

655
01:20:41,558 --> 01:20:43,325
Are you fucking kidding me?
Stop this!

656
01:20:43,327 --> 01:20:45,026
-Eva...
-They took my mom!
They took my mom!

657
01:20:45,028 --> 01:20:47,195
- I heard what he said.
- Please give me the phone.

658
01:20:47,197 --> 01:20:49,531
You can't talk on
an unsecured line.
You know that.

659
01:20:49,533 --> 01:20:51,266
Give me the fucking phone!

660
01:20:51,268 --> 01:20:52,334
Give me the phone!

661
01:20:52,336 --> 01:20:53,401
Give me the phone!

662
01:20:53,403 --> 01:20:55,737
I'm not giving you the phone.

663
01:20:55,738 --> 01:20:58,072
-Give me the fucking phone!
-I'm not giving you
the fucking phone!

664
01:20:58,075 --> 01:21:00,075
Okay?

665
01:21:00,077 --> 01:21:01,610
If you talk on
an unsecured line,

666
01:21:01,612 --> 01:21:03,211
they will be here in 15 minutes,

667
01:21:03,213 --> 01:21:04,613
and they will take you
just like they took your mom.

668
01:21:04,615 --> 01:21:05,947
Is that what you want?

669
01:21:07,317 --> 01:21:09,077
I can't let you do it.

670
01:21:09,653 --> 01:21:10,986
I'm not letting that happen.

671
01:21:12,155 --> 01:21:13,989
You're not gonna let me?

672
01:21:16,260 --> 01:21:19,160
You said you're not
gonna let me?

673
01:21:22,165 --> 01:21:24,232
What does that mean?
Huh?

674
01:21:24,234 --> 01:21:26,134
Eva, I'm not trying
to control you.

675
01:21:26,136 --> 01:21:28,003
Okay?

676
01:21:28,005 --> 01:21:29,337
I'm trying to protect you.

677
01:21:29,339 --> 01:21:30,605
Did you even ask me?

678
01:21:33,143 --> 01:21:36,511
After all this happened,
you just... You just did it.

679
01:21:36,513 --> 01:21:38,914
The... The quarantine,

680
01:21:38,916 --> 01:21:39,981
the fucking protocol.

681
01:21:39,983 --> 01:21:42,317
- This fucking...
- Hey, hey, hey!

682
01:21:42,319 --> 01:21:44,636
Come on, come on, come on.

683
01:21:44,637 --> 01:21:46,954
I fell asleep and
you just put me
in a fucking prison!

684
01:21:46,957 --> 01:21:49,591
Will! This is
a fucking prison!

685
01:21:51,695 --> 01:21:53,128
It's the way it is now.

686
01:21:57,134 --> 01:22:00,568
You are not with me.
I am alone.

687
01:22:02,239 --> 01:22:03,338
I'm...

688
01:22:11,581 --> 01:22:14,015
What the fuck are we
waiting for?

689
01:22:14,017 --> 01:22:16,184
Some kind of cure or miracle?

690
01:22:19,356 --> 01:22:21,489
I wanna go out there!

691
01:22:21,491 --> 01:22:23,224
I wanna see the sun!

692
01:22:23,226 --> 01:22:25,727
-I wanna talk to my dad.
-Lower your voice.
Lower your voice!

693
01:22:25,729 --> 01:22:29,364
-I wanna talk to my dad.
My dad...
-Lower your voice.

694
01:22:29,366 --> 01:22:32,634
Please let me talk to my dad.

695
01:22:39,242 --> 01:22:41,376
What's happened to us, Will?

696
01:22:44,081 --> 01:22:46,114
What are we even doing this for?

697
01:22:55,492 --> 01:22:57,058
Do you even love me?

698
01:22:58,195 --> 01:23:00,161
Hmm?

699
01:23:00,163 --> 01:23:02,123
I don't know what
to fucking say.

700
01:23:03,633 --> 01:23:07,369
But what I do know
is that we can survive this.

701
01:23:07,371 --> 01:23:09,404
Okay?

702
01:23:09,406 --> 01:23:12,173
We made it this far, you and me.

703
01:23:26,656 --> 01:23:28,696
What if I don't want
any of this, huh?

704
01:23:30,460 --> 01:23:32,527
What if I don't want
any of this?

705
01:23:32,529 --> 01:23:36,431
I'm waiting for you
to wake up and realize
that this is life now.

706
01:23:58,388 --> 01:24:00,088
Eva, put the gun down.

707
01:24:07,064 --> 01:24:08,596
Okay?
