1
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:41,667
This is Helo 1. I have
visual confirmation on Hodaddy.

2
00:00:41,841 --> 00:00:45,709
Still negative on our bad boy.
Repeat. Still negative on the pickup.

3
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:49,940
Heading for rendezvous
at LZ Alpha Echo.

4
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:09,065
All right, where are you, Percy?
Come on. Come on.

5
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:13,695
Wait a second. There's our turncoat.

6
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:46,970
For crying out loud.

7
00:01:51,744 --> 00:01:53,006
Special Agent Scott.

8
00:01:53,179 --> 00:01:55,579
Mac here.
Tell me you found that pilot.

9
00:01:55,748 --> 00:01:58,444
Absolutely. He's right here.

10
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:00,817
- Here you go.
- Is he alive?

11
00:02:04,891 --> 00:02:05,983
Yeah, he's okay.

12
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:08,753
Don't screw this up, Alex.
I want him in one piece.

13
00:02:08,928 --> 00:02:10,828
Consider it done.

14
00:02:22,942 --> 00:02:26,207
- You okay?
- No, my leg's broken!

15
00:02:26,379 --> 00:02:28,779
You got ice on it right away.
That should help.

16
00:02:29,082 --> 00:02:31,073
Let's go before the Russians
get here.

17
00:02:31,584 --> 00:02:34,109
Hey, let me ask you something.

18
00:02:34,287 --> 00:02:37,120
What'd you do with that plane
that you stole?

19
00:02:40,527 --> 00:02:42,427
Here they come.

20
00:02:42,595 --> 00:02:44,460
I'm not talking until you get me out.

21
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:46,025
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

22
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:47,928
All right, let's go.

23
00:02:48,101 --> 00:02:51,036
God! Okay! Gundars!

24
00:02:51,204 --> 00:02:55,140
I sold the plane to Arnold Gundars.
Now get me out of here!

25
00:02:56,209 --> 00:02:58,439
Get up.

26
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:00,771
Hurry! The American pilot
has escaped!

27
00:03:01,748 --> 00:03:04,546
Search the woods!
He must be in the woods!

28
00:03:21,167 --> 00:03:22,896
What is this?

29
00:03:24,103 --> 00:03:26,230
Stalin's butt!
He tricked us!

30
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:33,276
- They're coming!
- I got it.

31
00:03:35,348 --> 00:03:37,407
No, I don't.

32
00:03:49,462 --> 00:03:51,589
Fire!

33
00:03:54,801 --> 00:03:57,770
You okay?

34
00:04:12,986 --> 00:04:17,787
Ladies and gentlemen,
now making his way to the ring...

35
00:04:17,957 --> 00:04:21,984
...really needing no introduction
the world over, he is undefeated...

36
00:04:22,161 --> 00:04:24,652
...with 56 wins, no losses...

37
00:04:24,831 --> 00:04:28,028
...here is the one and only...

38
00:04:28,201 --> 00:04:33,696
...Kelly "K. O. " Robinson!

39
00:04:33,873 --> 00:04:36,967
When I say break, break clean.
Keep those punches up high.

40
00:04:37,143 --> 00:04:38,371
I'm fair, but I'm firm.

41
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:41,338
You'll have your first
Sports Illustrated cover.

42
00:04:41,514 --> 00:04:43,482
Even though you'll be on it like this:

43
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:46,184
- We'll see who looks like that.
- Touch them up.

44
00:04:46,352 --> 00:04:49,378
Yeah, shit.
He's scary as hell, ain't he?

45
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:57,219
Kelly Robinson has come up with
an exotic new challenge for himself.

46
00:04:57,397 --> 00:04:59,228
If he defends his title tonight...

47
00:04:59,599 --> 00:05:04,764
...he'll do it again Thursday
in Budapest, Hungary.

48
00:05:08,775 --> 00:05:10,538
I know what this means.

49
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:12,940
I know what this mean
when you do that.

50
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:15,372
And Lirette is on queer street.

51
00:05:15,548 --> 00:05:17,914
You know what's gonna
happen now, right?

52
00:05:21,554 --> 00:05:23,181
Boy, fight now! What you doing?

53
00:05:23,356 --> 00:05:26,120
Kelly's getting frustrated
because Lirette won't fight.

54
00:05:26,292 --> 00:05:29,489
I'll give you a free shot.
I won't chase you around the ring.

55
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:31,823
Take a shot at this here.

56
00:05:32,532 --> 00:05:34,295
Don't be scared. I'll close my eyes.

57
00:05:34,467 --> 00:05:35,695
How about that?

58
00:05:49,148 --> 00:05:51,309
Three! Four!

59
00:05:51,484 --> 00:05:53,577
Five! Six!

60
00:05:53,753 --> 00:05:56,722
Seven! Eight! Nine!

61
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:58,853
Ten! You're out!

62
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:01,755
Warm up the goulash in Budapest.

63
00:06:01,928 --> 00:06:04,158
Kelly Robinson is coming.

64
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:08,096
I told you. Hold on. Come on,
get this shot for Sports Illustrated.

65
00:06:08,468 --> 00:06:09,765
Cheese.

66
00:06:19,312 --> 00:06:21,246
Yeah.

67
00:06:22,081 --> 00:06:24,948
Yeah, 57 and 0. Gonna be 58 and 0
in couple of days.

68
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:27,450
Put infinity on there because
I'll never lose.

69
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:28,951
I know what you saying.

70
00:06:29,122 --> 00:06:32,057
You better retire. You gonna
run out of space on that arm.

71
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:35,319
Jerry, you ain't got to do that.
You been my boy for 10 years.

72
00:06:35,495 --> 00:06:37,827
Don't blow smoke up my ass.
Get your head out my ass.

73
00:06:37,997 --> 00:06:39,658
- Head's out the ass.
- Relax, man.

74
00:06:39,832 --> 00:06:41,891
Yeah, seriously, Jerry.
That's pathetic.

75
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:45,401
You've only worked three years.
Keep your head where it's at.

76
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:47,436
- Now, about the drawers.
- Yeah.

77
00:06:47,607 --> 00:06:50,508
I think I got some drawers
your size made of licorice.

78
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:53,774
Hello, sir. Yes, right. Hold on, sir.

79
00:06:53,946 --> 00:06:55,174
Kelly.

80
00:06:55,348 --> 00:06:57,009
- Kelly!
- Yeah? What's going on?

81
00:06:57,183 --> 00:06:58,411
It's the president.

82
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:00,518
Really?
President of the United States.

83
00:07:00,686 --> 00:07:03,280
The president want to talk
to Kelly Robinson.

84
00:07:03,456 --> 00:07:05,117
- Mr. President?
- What's up, homey?

85
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:06,758
- What's up?
- What's up, dog?

86
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:09,451
- It's all good. How you doing?
- Kicking with Putin.

87
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:12,291
G.W.B., you should've called
when the cameras was on.

88
00:07:12,465 --> 00:07:14,729
- My bad. I got a mucho hush-hush.
- All right.

89
00:07:14,901 --> 00:07:18,359
Hear you're going to Budapest. We
got us a muy secret-o situation.

90
00:07:18,538 --> 00:07:20,938
- Really?
- America needs your help.

91
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:23,405
- No problem.
- We need a little civilian cover.

92
00:07:23,576 --> 00:07:25,134
- You got it, baby.
- Owe you one.

93
00:07:25,311 --> 00:07:28,508
- All right, I'll talk to you real soon.
- I will not forget...

94
00:07:28,681 --> 00:07:30,512
President want me to do him a favor.

95
00:07:30,683 --> 00:07:32,708
He said something
about America needs me.

96
00:07:32,885 --> 00:07:36,048
- What kind of favor?
- Some kind of top-secret mission.

97
00:07:36,222 --> 00:07:38,156
Oh, you mean like 007?

98
00:07:38,324 --> 00:07:41,054
Yeah, except only I'm
gonna be 009 and a half.

99
00:07:41,227 --> 00:07:45,664
Know what I'm saying? 007. You
know what 009 and a half means?

100
00:07:45,832 --> 00:07:47,356
- I think so.
- It's an innuendo.

101
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:53,468
- You're going to Budapest?
- Yes, I am. Kind of exciting.

102
00:07:55,408 --> 00:07:58,070
- I'm a little nervous.
- I'm sure you'll do fine.

103
00:07:58,244 --> 00:08:00,439
No, I know I will.

104
00:08:00,913 --> 00:08:02,210
That's got a kick to it.

105
00:08:02,381 --> 00:08:06,112
This is my first chance to work
with Special Agent Rachel Wright.

106
00:08:06,285 --> 00:08:08,776
Rachel. You're still hung up on her?

107
00:08:08,955 --> 00:08:10,513
Edna, I'm not hung up on her.

108
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:13,022
I find her interesting,
and I admire her work.

109
00:08:13,192 --> 00:08:14,955
There's a certain allure she has.

110
00:08:15,127 --> 00:08:16,958
You know, a blind man could
see that.

111
00:08:17,129 --> 00:08:18,596
Well, why don't you tell her?

112
00:08:18,764 --> 00:08:23,428
I will tell her. It's just, I get nervous,
and I end up sounding like an idiot...

113
00:08:25,805 --> 00:08:28,137
Want me to tell you how
to melt Rachel's heart?

114
00:08:28,307 --> 00:08:30,400
- Yeah.
- Talk to Carlos.

115
00:08:30,576 --> 00:08:32,441
What does that mean?
They had a thing?

116
00:08:32,612 --> 00:08:34,705
Two-week stakeout.
She could barely walk.

117
00:08:34,881 --> 00:08:36,712
Rachel and Carlos?

118
00:08:36,883 --> 00:08:38,748
You called, Edna?

119
00:08:39,318 --> 00:08:42,310
You are a vision, as always.

120
00:08:42,755 --> 00:08:44,814
Hello, Alex.

121
00:08:44,991 --> 00:08:47,152
Hello, Carlos. How was Cuba?

122
00:08:47,326 --> 00:08:49,089
Adequate.

123
00:08:49,262 --> 00:08:50,820
Oh, adequate, my eye.

124
00:08:50,997 --> 00:08:53,329
He single-handedly averted
another Bay of Pigs.

125
00:08:53,499 --> 00:08:54,488
- No, I didn't...
- Yes.

126
00:08:54,667 --> 00:08:56,328
- You exaggerate.
- Oh, well, I...

127
00:08:56,502 --> 00:08:59,403
- You do exaggerate sometimes.
- Okay, at times, yeah.

128
00:08:59,572 --> 00:09:00,732
And you, Alex?

129
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,572
How did you fare in the tundra?

130
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:06,100
You know, I did pretty good.

131
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:10,272
I got selected for a new mission, so
obviously everybody was satisfied.

132
00:09:10,616 --> 00:09:11,640
And the pilot?

133
00:09:12,184 --> 00:09:15,517
The pilot...

134
00:09:15,688 --> 00:09:19,954
Was able to talk to him, get some
valuable information from him.

135
00:09:20,126 --> 00:09:21,593
Successful mission.

136
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:25,788
Alex, you didn't go and get
him killed, now, did you?

137
00:09:25,965 --> 00:09:29,298
No, no, no. I mean...

138
00:09:29,468 --> 00:09:31,868
You know, sort of. I mean...
Yeah, he's dead.

139
00:09:32,038 --> 00:09:34,063
He's dead.

140
00:09:36,709 --> 00:09:38,802
What are you gonna do?

141
00:09:39,312 --> 00:09:41,746
- Let me tell you something, Alex.
- Yeah.

142
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:45,975
You're an excellent agent.
Don't let results like this fool you.

143
00:09:46,152 --> 00:09:48,017
All right?

144
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,651
My car. Be back for my things later.

145
00:09:57,063 --> 00:09:59,054
See you, Carlos. La vida loca!

146
00:10:01,867 --> 00:10:04,131
What a phony.

147
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:08,335
I'd give anything to go on
a two-week stakeout with that man.

148
00:10:08,507 --> 00:10:11,408
What happened on the stakeout
between him and Rachel?

149
00:10:11,577 --> 00:10:15,843
- I didn't hear anything.
- It's not what I heard, it's what I saw.

150
00:10:16,015 --> 00:10:19,348
It's what I saw.
I saw the look on her face.

151
00:10:19,518 --> 00:10:21,418
Every woman recognizes that look.

152
00:10:21,587 --> 00:10:24,681
- What's that look?
- Look of total satisfaction.

153
00:10:31,864 --> 00:10:36,198
Guy gets a couple missions in Latin
America, and he's a Julio lglesias.

154
00:10:36,369 --> 00:10:38,270
You know, he's from lowa,
by the way.

155
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:38,861
You know, he's from lowa,
by the way.

156
00:10:39,038 --> 00:10:41,029
- Is this my stuff?
- Oh, easy.

157
00:10:41,207 --> 00:10:44,802
This is Carlos' stuff. This is yours.

158
00:10:50,616 --> 00:10:52,777
Where's my monofilament
phone descender?

159
00:10:53,719 --> 00:10:57,177
I didn't get one of these exploding
pagers. I don't see one of those.

160
00:10:57,957 --> 00:10:59,254
You got the micro GPS.

161
00:10:59,425 --> 00:11:00,915
Micro?

162
00:11:01,627 --> 00:11:02,685
This is your spy-cam.

163
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:09,864
This is Carlos' spy-cam,
and this is my spy-cam?

164
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:12,799
Look at the size of this thing!

165
00:11:12,972 --> 00:11:15,497
Size matters.
But in the spy world, it's reversed.

166
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:19,509
You want people to say, "Look how
small and sexy and sleek this is."

167
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:23,615
Not, "How huge this is! Look what he
pulled out of his pants. It's huge!"

168
00:11:23,783 --> 00:11:28,015
People will laugh at me if I pull this
out. Is that his escape module?

169
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:31,520
Yes, it is. I know, everybody wants
to be like Carlos.

170
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:34,182
I don't want to be like Carlos,
but I notice...

171
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:38,296
...my stuff looks like you can get it
from RadioShack in 1972.

172
00:11:41,567 --> 00:11:42,556
Yes, it is.

173
00:11:45,671 --> 00:11:47,536
Right away.

174
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:50,972
All right, we'll finish this later.
It's a good start, though.

175
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:58,341
Kelly Robinson, seen here making
his typical flamboyant entrance...

176
00:11:58,517 --> 00:12:01,213
Shouldn't this be on the
Weather Channel or something?

177
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:04,379
...with a first-round knockout
of Blake "The Blade" Lirette.

178
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:09,620
Yeah! 57 and 0, baby!
Kelly Robinson, baby!

179
00:12:09,795 --> 00:12:11,922
That guy is so annoying.

180
00:12:12,098 --> 00:12:13,963
Everybody "Hungary"
for his showdown...

181
00:12:14,133 --> 00:12:16,829
...with the European
heavyweight king, Cedric Mills.

182
00:12:17,002 --> 00:12:19,232
You don't understand
how important it is...

183
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:22,238
...that I be 58 and 0.
I'm 57 and 0 right now.

184
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:23,602
This man gonna be 58!

185
00:12:23,776 --> 00:12:26,108
- That guy is a born jerk.
- Cheese. Cheese.

186
00:12:26,278 --> 00:12:28,678
That's right, take my picture.
Cheese. Cheese.

187
00:12:28,848 --> 00:12:31,112
Get my right side. Cheese.

188
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:34,151
Alex!

189
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,754
Gen. Tucker, this is
Special Agent Alex Scott.

190
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:38,583
- General.
- Special agent.

191
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:41,955
I love hearing that. I was a regular
agent a couple weeks ago...

192
00:12:42,128 --> 00:12:45,461
...and then around Christmas,
I got promoted to special.

193
00:12:45,865 --> 00:12:47,230
Special.

194
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:49,366
We were going over the op.

195
00:12:49,835 --> 00:12:51,268
We call it the "Switchblade."

196
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:55,464
It was the first electrochromatic
invisible stealth aircraft.

197
00:12:55,641 --> 00:12:57,541
But in the hands of the evildoers...

198
00:12:57,710 --> 00:13:01,305
...it's an untraceable delivery system
for weapons of mass destruction.

199
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,038
New owner: Arnold Gundars.

200
00:13:03,215 --> 00:13:06,707
The boys over at CIA have access
to his overseas accounts.

201
00:13:06,886 --> 00:13:09,878
The past five days, there's been
a depletion of funds...

202
00:13:10,055 --> 00:13:11,386
...without reimbursements.

203
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:13,683
The bastard's bought
the damn plane.

204
00:13:13,859 --> 00:13:15,224
He just hasn't sold it yet.

205
00:13:15,494 --> 00:13:17,985
I'll get it back, general.

206
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:22,801
Give me a minute.

207
00:13:23,702 --> 00:13:24,691
Hot.

208
00:13:27,673 --> 00:13:29,504
Are you sure we can't use Carlos?

209
00:13:29,675 --> 00:13:30,937
No, they all know him.

210
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:34,841
Without plastic surgery, he wouldn't
last five minutes on this case.

211
00:13:35,014 --> 00:13:36,572
That's a shame.

212
00:13:36,749 --> 00:13:38,410
That Carlos is amazing.

213
00:13:39,251 --> 00:13:41,310
This guy...

214
00:13:42,421 --> 00:13:44,412
You sure about this, Mac?

215
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:46,922
He'll get the job done.

216
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:51,391
Shouldn't Rachel be here?

217
00:13:51,564 --> 00:13:53,429
She's already in Budapest
setting up.

218
00:13:53,599 --> 00:13:55,760
You've worked with her
before, right?

219
00:13:55,935 --> 00:13:57,903
I have but not
in a stakeout situation.

220
00:13:58,204 --> 00:14:00,434
This mission doesn't call
for a stakeout.

221
00:14:00,606 --> 00:14:02,801
It wouldn't hurt to keep
our options open.

222
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:05,367
The European middleweight
championship...

223
00:14:05,544 --> 00:14:07,637
...is being held in Budapest
in two days.

224
00:14:07,813 --> 00:14:11,374
Gundars is a boxing fanatic. He's
throwing a party the night before.

225
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:14,144
Okay. Classic stakeout
scenario, right?

226
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,812
No, Alex. No stakeout. This is
more about hacking and tracking.

227
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:21,187
Now, take a look at this guest list.

228
00:14:22,728 --> 00:14:26,721
You got to be kidding. This is like a
who's who of international bad guys.

229
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:30,357
Obviously, Gundars is using this
party as cover to auction the plane.

230
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:32,561
Your mission is to get
into his palace...

231
00:14:32,738 --> 00:14:35,866
...find out where the plane is
and stop him from selling it.

232
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:39,408
With these heavy hitters in one
place, security's gonna be insane.

233
00:14:39,578 --> 00:14:43,981
Exactly. The way we see it, there's
only one shot to get you in there.

234
00:14:46,018 --> 00:14:47,178
Stakeout?

235
00:14:49,688 --> 00:14:50,916
No.

236
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:53,115
We've arranged cover.

237
00:14:54,093 --> 00:14:56,755
You'll be working with a civilian
to secure entry.

238
00:14:56,929 --> 00:14:57,918
A civilian?

239
00:14:58,097 --> 00:15:01,464
57 and 0. Gonna be 58 and 0.
You know how Kelly Robinson do.

240
00:15:01,634 --> 00:15:04,432
Listen to me now. I don't
care what Gen. Patton says.

241
00:15:04,603 --> 00:15:06,935
We don't need to do it this way.
I think if...

242
00:15:07,106 --> 00:15:08,835
I kicked ass all around the world.

243
00:15:09,008 --> 00:15:12,273
For crying out loud. Can we turn
this off or change the channel?

244
00:15:12,444 --> 00:15:13,843
He gives me a headache...

245
00:15:14,013 --> 00:15:16,675
Watch what come out of your
mouth, blond surfer boy.

246
00:15:16,849 --> 00:15:19,443
He never shuts up. He's lighting
into some reporter.

247
00:15:19,618 --> 00:15:22,553
No, I'm talking to you. Watch
what come out of your mouth.

248
00:15:22,721 --> 00:15:26,384
You digging your grave with your
tongue. You'll get your ass whipped.

249
00:15:26,558 --> 00:15:27,718
Video conference.

250
00:15:27,893 --> 00:15:31,158
Alex Scott, meet Kelly Robinson.

251
00:15:45,844 --> 00:15:47,402
That's gotta be him.

252
00:15:56,522 --> 00:16:01,357
Yeah, girl, you crazy. Come on out
here and give me some sugar, girl.

253
00:16:01,527 --> 00:16:04,325
I had too much fun last night.
And you too.

254
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:09,957
Let's bounce. I got y'all's numbers.
I'll call you y'all soon.

255
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:12,194
I'll talk to you all soon.
Bye-bye.

256
00:16:12,371 --> 00:16:14,464
No Kelly, no stretchie.
Back of the bus.

257
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,871
Move the camouflage booty to the
back of the bus. Come on.

258
00:16:22,381 --> 00:16:25,145
Hey, I'm Alex Scott.
We met yesterday, sort of.

259
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:28,047
Yeah, I remember.
The pleasure's all mine.

260
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:31,452
Is that your plane?

261
00:16:31,623 --> 00:16:33,022
Step away! No autographs!

262
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:35,293
It's all right. He's my new assistant.

263
00:16:35,461 --> 00:16:37,486
Kelly, I thought I was your assistant.

264
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:40,723
T.J., what'd I tell you?
The secret mission? Secret mission.

265
00:16:40,899 --> 00:16:42,992
Secret mission.

266
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:46,535
- Yeah, yeah, the Mission Man.
- Right. Right.

267
00:16:52,578 --> 00:16:56,173
It's not a good idea to tell them who
I am. We should keep that down.

268
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:58,680
I ain't no fool. I ain't
tell them who you was.

269
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:01,649
I said I had to take care
of the president's retarded nephew.

270
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:04,721
- What?
- Yeah, they think you're a retard.

271
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:09,190
All you do is get some drool, a helmet
and zip your jacket up.

272
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:11,454
You get that
mentally challenged look.

273
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:14,190
Hold on just a second. That's good.

274
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:19,463
- Can I talk to you for a second?
- Yeah, go ahead. What's up?

275
00:17:19,638 --> 00:17:23,233
Excuse us. Uncomfortable.
Too many brothers standing around.

276
00:17:23,409 --> 00:17:25,274
We're getting off on the wrong foot.

277
00:17:25,444 --> 00:17:27,639
You think you're
the Harlem Globetrotters...

278
00:17:27,813 --> 00:17:29,974
...and I'm the team
that looks like an idiot.

279
00:17:30,149 --> 00:17:32,879
- Yeah, that's it.
- But that's not how it's gonna work.

280
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:35,418
We're on the same team.
I'm Meadowlark Lemon.

281
00:17:35,587 --> 00:17:38,784
You're Curly Neal. You feed
me the ball. Remember Curly, he...

282
00:17:38,957 --> 00:17:40,686
He do the dribbling.
You Meadowlark?

283
00:17:40,859 --> 00:17:43,953
I'm pulling down the ref's shorts,
throwing pie in the face.

284
00:17:44,129 --> 00:17:46,324
- The bucket of confetti.
- They think it's water.

285
00:17:46,498 --> 00:17:49,365
- And the rubber band on the ball.
- Right, doing the...

286
00:17:49,535 --> 00:17:52,231
Meadowlark, you get me
some of this chicken...

287
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:55,931
...some sodas, jelly beans and get
these bags and get on the plane.

288
00:17:56,108 --> 00:17:58,303
Meadowlark. You heard
what he said to me?

289
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:02,677
He told me that in this situation, he
would be Meadowlark and I'm Curly.

290
00:18:02,848 --> 00:18:07,182
What kind of bullshit is that?
Curly, my ass. I'm Meadowlark.

291
00:18:11,356 --> 00:18:13,483
- I'm not Kelly Robinson.
- No, you ain't.

292
00:18:13,659 --> 00:18:16,856
- He don't make his own phone calls.
- He don't call his mama!

293
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:20,123
Come on. I'm just trying
to confirm the man's reservation.

294
00:18:20,299 --> 00:18:22,096
- All we need is a room.
- That's all.

295
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:25,930
- Don't make me get on that phone.
- What the hell is:

296
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:30,802
It means, "I speak English,
just not to you, sucker."

297
00:18:30,976 --> 00:18:33,638
Guys, I speak Hungarian.
Need some help?

298
00:18:33,812 --> 00:18:35,473
- Okay.
- Yeah, knock yourself out.

299
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:38,639
The brother gonna
speak Hungarian now.

300
00:18:38,817 --> 00:18:39,977
- Szia.
- Hello?

301
00:18:40,152 --> 00:18:41,141
Igen, igen.

302
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:44,983
You guys want the junior suite
or the high-roller suite?

303
00:18:45,657 --> 00:18:48,148
We go with the high-roller.

304
00:18:48,327 --> 00:18:50,818
The cheapest room you've got.

305
00:18:51,163 --> 00:18:53,131
In the basement.

306
00:18:53,999 --> 00:18:56,991
- It's all taken care of.
- Did you get an extra kusenum?

307
00:18:57,169 --> 00:18:59,069
I'm gonna get these bags onboard.

308
00:18:59,238 --> 00:19:03,004
- Don't wanna get yelled at again.
- Yeah, yeah. Hustle. Hustle on.

309
00:19:03,175 --> 00:19:07,271
You better watch your job.
Rain Man got skills.

310
00:19:12,284 --> 00:19:14,479
Kelly just took the stick.

311
00:19:14,853 --> 00:19:17,947
- I thought he was doing an interview.
- What? He was napping.

312
00:19:18,123 --> 00:19:21,422
What? Now he's flying the plane?
Come on, Kelly!

313
00:19:24,129 --> 00:19:26,597
There's a lot of stuff
for us to go over...

314
00:19:26,932 --> 00:19:29,059
Did you see me turn on
the seat-belt light?

315
00:19:29,234 --> 00:19:31,259
No, I didn't see that.

316
00:19:37,142 --> 00:19:40,441
Sit your ass down!
When you get up, sit down.

317
00:19:42,881 --> 00:19:44,371
Funny.

318
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:49,211
He's a funny guy.
I gotta remember that one.

319
00:19:49,388 --> 00:19:53,222
When you did the stick up, I went
flying there! That's a good trick.

320
00:19:53,392 --> 00:19:55,724
I'm glad you got that
out of your system.

321
00:19:55,894 --> 00:19:58,089
I'm gonna need you
at the party at 8.

322
00:19:58,263 --> 00:20:00,993
Know something?
We got to change the schedule.

323
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:04,567
Kelly Robinson don't go to parties
at 8:00. I ain't about to start.

324
00:20:04,736 --> 00:20:07,330
Are you gonna refer to yourself
in the third person?

325
00:20:07,506 --> 00:20:09,064
That can get irritating.

326
00:20:09,241 --> 00:20:11,334
It won't get irritating until 11:00...

327
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:15,071
...because that's when I'm
showing up for your little party.

328
00:20:15,514 --> 00:20:18,142
Okay. Excuse me, gents.

329
00:20:19,918 --> 00:20:22,785
I can't risk that. The party could
clear out by 11:00.

330
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:26,081
Ain't no party that Kelly Robinson
at gonna end at 11:00.

331
00:20:26,258 --> 00:20:29,785
- That attitude can destroy a mission.
- Know what destroys a mission?

332
00:20:29,962 --> 00:20:34,228
A lame-ass party that end at 11:00.
Let that shit go, man.

333
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:36,264
- Drop the shit.
- Okay.

334
00:20:36,435 --> 00:20:40,599
- I'll get T.J. or Jerry to get me in.
- Yeah, go get T.J. He'll help you.

335
00:20:40,772 --> 00:20:44,139
I just hope that the optical
diaphanous polyalloy transducers...

336
00:20:44,309 --> 00:20:46,402
...can fit on one of their retinas.

337
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:48,637
What you say?
What you got over there?

338
00:20:48,814 --> 00:20:52,011
It's one of the things we've got
for the mission. It's cool.

339
00:20:52,184 --> 00:20:54,846
It opens up. I put this little camera
in my eye...

340
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:58,148
...and I give this to T.J.
Then he can see everything I see.

341
00:20:58,323 --> 00:21:03,693
Wait. I don't want T.J. 's eye juices
on something that goes in my eye.

342
00:21:03,862 --> 00:21:05,853
Maybe I should try it.
What you call it?

343
00:21:06,031 --> 00:21:09,398
- Polyalloy transducers.
- The polyalloy should be for me.

344
00:21:09,568 --> 00:21:11,468
Let me put it in my eye, then.

345
00:21:11,903 --> 00:21:14,167
- I put this in my eye?
- Put it in your eye.

346
00:21:14,339 --> 00:21:15,806
- This is some spy shit?
- Yeah.

347
00:21:15,974 --> 00:21:18,169
Okay, I'll put this in.

348
00:21:18,377 --> 00:21:19,969
And I got
the camera in my eye.

349
00:21:20,345 --> 00:21:21,903
What's gonna happen now?

350
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,809
Can you see anything?

351
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:26,679
What about now?

352
00:21:27,185 --> 00:21:29,210
- Hey, I see me!
- Look, watch this.

353
00:21:29,388 --> 00:21:32,585
That's bad. Shit, now I see the TV.
I'm seeing what you seeing.

354
00:21:32,758 --> 00:21:35,727
- Exactly.
- I see me looking at you looking at me!

355
00:21:35,894 --> 00:21:37,885
Hey, Kelly Robinson.

356
00:21:38,063 --> 00:21:42,056
Look at this. Put this behind
your ear. It's a listening device.

357
00:21:42,234 --> 00:21:44,532
- Just stick it back here?
- Can you hear me?

358
00:21:44,703 --> 00:21:47,934
Yeah, it sound like you
in my head. Shit, I like this!

359
00:21:48,106 --> 00:21:49,767
We'll do that on the mission.

360
00:21:49,941 --> 00:21:51,932
- At 11:00, though.
- No, not 11:00.

361
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:55,568
I already spoke. Kelly Robinson
has spoke. I said 11, it's 11.

362
00:21:55,747 --> 00:21:57,715
It's a dead issue. Let it go.

363
00:21:57,883 --> 00:22:00,283
I said 11, goddamn it!
Get out my face!

364
00:22:00,452 --> 00:22:02,750
- That shit is bad.
- Then give them back.

365
00:22:02,921 --> 00:22:04,752
I ain't giving back shit. Take them.

366
00:22:04,923 --> 00:22:07,756
That look like I'm yelling at me.
Take them!

367
00:22:07,926 --> 00:22:11,623
I'm Kelly Robinson, baby, 57 and 0!
I'll kick your ass!

368
00:22:11,797 --> 00:22:15,289
This is what it look like when I'm
whupping somebody's ass.

369
00:22:15,467 --> 00:22:18,129
That's scary. Kelly.
Oh, yeah, that's scary.

370
00:22:18,303 --> 00:22:21,238
Look at that move.
Kelly Robinson.

371
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:25,407
Why you staring at me?
Do something.

372
00:22:25,577 --> 00:22:28,239
- Okay, Kelly.
- I heard that in my head.

373
00:22:28,413 --> 00:22:31,940
You looking in the cockpit right now.
That's a trip.

374
00:22:32,117 --> 00:22:35,712
- What's our altitude?
- About 37,000 feet.

375
00:22:35,887 --> 00:22:40,221
- Is that a Cessna on the horizon?
- Where?

376
00:22:43,829 --> 00:22:45,228
Surfer boy!

377
00:22:46,598 --> 00:22:48,498
- You seeing this?
- What are you doing?

378
00:22:48,667 --> 00:22:51,363
- Come fly the plane.
- Wake him back up!

379
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:54,505
- He fell asleep.
- You put that dart in his back!

380
00:22:55,006 --> 00:22:57,907
- I thought you knew how to fly it.
- Wake him up.

381
00:22:58,076 --> 00:23:02,308
I don't know how to fly it!
He put it on automatic for me!

382
00:23:02,481 --> 00:23:06,144
The deal is, we go at 8,
and I wake the pilot up.

383
00:23:06,318 --> 00:23:09,014
Okay, then let the plane crash.
Let it crash.

384
00:23:09,187 --> 00:23:12,281
You know that ride I just took?
Get ready for a great ride.

385
00:23:12,457 --> 00:23:15,119
I'm ready to die, baby.
I'm Kelly Robinson.

386
00:23:15,293 --> 00:23:19,195
Death? That's how I feel
about death. Go on. Crash it.

387
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:26,462
This is getting crazy.
Wake the man up.

388
00:23:26,638 --> 00:23:29,801
- Do we have a deal?
- Yes. Just wake the man up!

389
00:23:31,877 --> 00:23:35,608
- Hey, Ken. He ain't woke.
- He'll wake up. He'll be fine.

390
00:23:35,781 --> 00:23:39,182
- So you a pilot this whole time?
- I can fly a little.

391
00:23:39,351 --> 00:23:41,182
Okay, I see how this is gonna work.

392
00:23:41,353 --> 00:23:45,119
I ain't coming to no party at 8:00.
I told you 11:00. Here's your eye.

393
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:47,417
- Hey, be careful with that.
- Hey, my ass.

394
00:23:47,592 --> 00:23:52,461
If you broke something in my plane,
if something in my plane is broke...

395
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:07,874
You in trouble, T.J.

396
00:24:11,316 --> 00:24:12,908
Oh, God.

397
00:24:16,988 --> 00:24:19,548
It wasn't my fault, man.
It was Mission Man.

398
00:24:19,724 --> 00:24:23,091
I'm going downstairs! No, we in
the basement. I'm going upstairs.

399
00:24:23,261 --> 00:24:27,357
You got five minutes to get me
the most expensive suite...

400
00:24:27,532 --> 00:24:30,558
...or else, T.J.! Or else!
- Or else what?

401
00:24:30,735 --> 00:24:34,671
I don't know what else, because
I don't think good underground.

402
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:38,469
But whatever it is, it's gonna be bad!
Let me tell you something.

403
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:42,238
You falling off. You're gonna
be back in St. Louis, frying fish.

404
00:24:42,414 --> 00:24:45,349
Now, you mess up one
more time again. I'm waiting.

405
00:24:45,517 --> 00:24:48,645
Please do it one more. Just please.
One more time.

406
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:52,085
One more time. Please let him do it
one more time.

407
00:24:53,024 --> 00:24:54,252
Oh, my God.

408
00:24:56,595 --> 00:24:59,257
Hey! How's the room?

409
00:24:59,664 --> 00:25:03,896
My room is fine. Oh, did I say
11? I meant to say 12. Maybe.

410
00:25:04,069 --> 00:25:06,333
- What's with the attitude?
- Excuse me!

411
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:11,340
- Kelly Robinson? The famous boxer?
- Yeah, one and the same, baby.

412
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:14,741
- I can't believe it!
- It's a big thrill for you, huh?

413
00:25:14,913 --> 00:25:19,509
You don't know. I know you from
the advertisement for your perfume.

414
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:22,448
- Kelly Robinson. TKO.
- TKO. That's right.

415
00:25:22,621 --> 00:25:24,589
It's not perfume. It's cologne.

416
00:25:24,756 --> 00:25:27,919
Perfume is for ladies and sissies.
I put out cologne.

417
00:25:28,093 --> 00:25:29,287
I so stupid.

418
00:25:29,461 --> 00:25:32,919
So, Kelly, tell me...

419
00:25:33,431 --> 00:25:36,525
...do you really wear it?

420
00:25:37,302 --> 00:25:39,668
Well, you tell me.

421
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:47,435
I'd love to go to your room
and get your autograph.

422
00:25:47,612 --> 00:25:52,743
Is that right? I'd really love to, but
unfortunately, my room ain't ready.

423
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:55,448
Let's go to mine. Is very...

424
00:25:56,321 --> 00:25:58,516
...very close.
- Hey, hey.

425
00:25:58,690 --> 00:26:01,215
Wrong. Wrong. Wrong.
Excuse me.

426
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:04,260
- No. Come here for a second.
- Excuse me.

427
00:26:04,429 --> 00:26:06,693
- What's wrong with you?
- What are you doing?

428
00:26:06,865 --> 00:26:09,060
Nothing. But if you let go
of my arm...

429
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:11,464
...l'm gonna go across
and wax that ass.

430
00:26:11,636 --> 00:26:15,094
You are a spy right now.
I can't have you running off...

431
00:26:15,273 --> 00:26:17,070
...with a strange Hungarian woman.

432
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:20,507
I'm Kelly Robinson. Going off
with a strange woman is what I do.

433
00:26:20,679 --> 00:26:23,648
Mind your own business.
Have a good evening, all right?

434
00:26:23,815 --> 00:26:26,841
- I'm just jealous.
- I know, but she chose Kelly.

435
00:26:27,018 --> 00:26:29,384
I'll hit it once for you, all right?

436
00:26:29,554 --> 00:26:33,820
- See if she's got a sister.
- Lf so, it'll be the three of us.

437
00:26:33,992 --> 00:26:37,428
Why don't you go see the city?
What you say your name was?

438
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:42,363
- Are you going to scream it?
- I will scream your name if I know it.

439
00:26:42,534 --> 00:26:45,799
I had a couple of interesting
situations where...

440
00:26:45,971 --> 00:26:49,338
- What happened?
- The girl tried to press charges...

441
00:26:51,176 --> 00:26:53,872
Hey, slow it down!
I got a lady over here.

442
00:26:57,882 --> 00:27:00,908
Hey, that's some serious road rage.

443
00:27:01,753 --> 00:27:04,278
What's up, man?
What's all this?

444
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:09,859
How long have you been working
for the U.S. government?

445
00:27:10,028 --> 00:27:13,520
- I work for Kelly Robinson.
- There was BNS agent on your jet.

446
00:27:13,698 --> 00:27:15,165
- I don't know.
- Who was he?

447
00:27:15,333 --> 00:27:19,565
- You've been reading spy novels.
- Maybe we should cut off his penis.

448
00:27:19,738 --> 00:27:23,868
Cut off my penis? What happened
to "rough the man up"?

449
00:27:24,042 --> 00:27:25,942
- Cut it off!
- Wait a second!

450
00:27:26,111 --> 00:27:30,241
You ain't cutting off nobody's penis!
I'll answer all your questions, but...

451
00:27:30,415 --> 00:27:33,213
- Who's the agent?
- I'm not sure if he's an agent.

452
00:27:33,385 --> 00:27:37,754
- Who's the agent?
- I don't know if he's an agent or not!

453
00:27:37,922 --> 00:27:41,050
- He's 5 foot 9. Blond hair...
- His name?

454
00:27:41,226 --> 00:27:45,185
I'm not sure, but he's very annoying.
He's definitely a BNS agent.

455
00:27:45,363 --> 00:27:46,523
His name?

456
00:27:46,698 --> 00:27:50,259
Y'all got these knives and guns
pointing at me, so I'm blocking!

457
00:27:50,435 --> 00:27:52,995
He got one of them white names.
Alan or...

458
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:56,470
- Take off his pants.
- Why you gonna take my pants off?

459
00:27:56,641 --> 00:27:59,166
Please don't cut off
Kelly Robinson's penis.

460
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:01,638
Freeze!

461
00:28:13,491 --> 00:28:16,483
Kelly! Kelly, shoot her!

462
00:28:17,295 --> 00:28:18,626
Shoot her!

463
00:28:26,137 --> 00:28:27,627
Did I kill her?

464
00:28:29,507 --> 00:28:31,134
Not yet.

465
00:28:33,445 --> 00:28:35,879
- Stop shooting that.
- What the hell's going...?

466
00:28:37,348 --> 00:28:40,909
I'm sorry, I'm being rude.
Special Agent Rachel Wright.

467
00:28:41,086 --> 00:28:43,816
- Nice to officially meet you.
- You're a spy!

468
00:28:43,988 --> 00:28:46,081
Don't tell anyone.

469
00:28:46,257 --> 00:28:48,020
- You're all BNS?
- It's all BNS.

470
00:28:48,193 --> 00:28:51,128
- Big fan, Mr. Robinson!
- Crazy way of showing it.

471
00:28:51,996 --> 00:28:55,159
- God, Alex, you been working out?
- Yeah, a little. Why?

472
00:28:55,333 --> 00:28:58,791
- You just got buff.
- Just doing curls.

473
00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:01,463
Two, three drops of me
come out of this.

474
00:29:01,639 --> 00:29:05,598
Alex wanted to test you
before we put you in the game.

475
00:29:05,777 --> 00:29:10,510
- So this whole thing was a big test?
- Unbelievable. That was great.

476
00:29:10,682 --> 00:29:11,944
- Really?
- Really.

477
00:29:12,117 --> 00:29:13,345
Oh, cool.

478
00:29:13,518 --> 00:29:16,453
- Guys, excuse us for a second.
- Yeah.

479
00:29:16,621 --> 00:29:20,079
- Hey, good job.
- Nice work, nice work. Good.

480
00:29:21,159 --> 00:29:23,787
I have seen hundreds of agents...

481
00:29:23,962 --> 00:29:27,420
...put through that exercise, and
I've never seen it handled so well.

482
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:29,567
- Never.
- Never.

483
00:29:29,734 --> 00:29:31,326
Yeah. Well, Kelly Robinson.

484
00:29:31,503 --> 00:29:33,903
It was like your instincts
were perfect.

485
00:29:34,072 --> 00:29:36,370
Give them unimportant information.

486
00:29:36,541 --> 00:29:40,807
Like he's blond, 5'9".
How many guys fit that description?

487
00:29:40,979 --> 00:29:44,073
That doesn't mean anything.
You'd never name names.

488
00:29:44,249 --> 00:29:48,811
You know what you are? You're a
"why not" guy, not a "why" guy.

489
00:29:48,987 --> 00:29:51,080
- What's the difference?
- A "why" guy's like:

490
00:29:51,256 --> 00:29:55,716
"Why are we gonna do this?"
They're afraid to make a decision.

491
00:29:55,894 --> 00:29:59,091
Afraid they might get in trouble.
As opposed to a "why not" guy.

492
00:29:59,264 --> 00:30:03,030
- He's like, "Roll the dice."
- That's me. Kelly Robinson.

493
00:30:03,201 --> 00:30:05,897
The "why not" guys are
like eagles. They don't flock.

494
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:08,038
The few, the proud, the "why not."

495
00:30:08,206 --> 00:30:11,642
The president wouldn't have called
me if I wasn't a "why not" guy.

496
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:13,402
Let me see everything.

497
00:30:13,578 --> 00:30:16,342
Now, Kelly, we gotta
get you up to speed.

498
00:30:16,514 --> 00:30:18,778
You're about to hear
a national secret.

499
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:24,582
This is Arnold Gundars, premier
arms dealer. He has this plane...

500
00:30:24,756 --> 00:30:26,121
...the Switchblade.

501
00:30:26,291 --> 00:30:29,522
It's a sophisticated prototype
stolen from the U.S. government.

502
00:30:29,694 --> 00:30:32,458
This is the next generation
of stealth technology.

503
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:35,793
Undetectable to radar, infrared,
even the human eye.

504
00:30:35,967 --> 00:30:39,334
- Our mission is to get it back.
- To make a long story short...

505
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:43,167
...we can't find it,
because we can't see it.

506
00:30:43,875 --> 00:30:47,003
Here it is with the electrochromatic
cloaking device engaged.

507
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:49,544
Like one of those bugs
that look like a leaf.

508
00:30:49,714 --> 00:30:52,410
- One of the who?
- There's this bug that...

509
00:30:52,584 --> 00:30:54,711
...stays safe because
it looks like a leaf.

510
00:30:54,886 --> 00:30:58,151
But it's not really a leaf.
It can make itself look like one.

511
00:30:58,323 --> 00:31:03,260
A leafy bug. It's a good name for it.
You should call that the "Leafy Bug."

512
00:31:03,494 --> 00:31:05,792
- That's a good idea.
- I'll pass that on.

513
00:31:05,964 --> 00:31:10,526
The Leafy Bug. We gotta go. We'll be
late for the mission. It's almost 8:00.

514
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:13,535
You owe me one belt. Yamaguchi.
Hey, you got a cell phone?

515
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:15,866
- Tuxedo.
- I'm gonna set that all up.

516
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:20,374
Hey, Alex, I'm sorry I kneed you and
roughed you up in there. You okay?

517
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:24,242
My gosh, don't be ridiculous.
I thought that was great.

518
00:31:24,415 --> 00:31:26,440
When you kneed me, I loved that.

519
00:31:26,618 --> 00:31:31,317
- You did? You loved that?
- I just felt it helped sell it.

520
00:31:31,489 --> 00:31:33,684
Made it convincing.

521
00:31:35,326 --> 00:31:39,057
Wait to turn this on. The satellite's
only good for the next 72 hours.

522
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:41,061
Let's hope that's more than we need.

523
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:43,496
All right, set us up.
You know the drill.

524
00:31:43,668 --> 00:31:45,863
- Hey, what's in that bag?
- Spy stuff.

525
00:31:46,237 --> 00:31:48,865
Rule number one:
Always have a sure way out.

526
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:51,304
- Hey, Rachel.
- What's up?

527
00:31:52,377 --> 00:31:55,278
It's weird. It feels like
a stakeout, doesn't it?

528
00:31:55,446 --> 00:31:58,142
No. Not really.

529
00:32:23,875 --> 00:32:26,139
And we are live.

530
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:29,807
Hey, what's that for?

531
00:32:29,981 --> 00:32:34,611
This is how I'm gonna break
this case wide open with your help.

532
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:36,913
It's a replica of the pen
Gundars carries.

533
00:32:37,088 --> 00:32:39,648
There's an IHB
tracking device built in.

534
00:32:39,824 --> 00:32:41,155
Technology.

535
00:32:41,326 --> 00:32:44,454
If Alex can plant it on him,
we can follow his movements.

536
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:47,427
Okay. Let's do this, then.

537
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:51,960
Nice shifting, Rachel. These
stick shifts can be a little tricky.

538
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:54,366
You make it look easy.

539
00:32:55,273 --> 00:32:57,241
Thank you.

540
00:32:59,277 --> 00:33:01,575
Please tell me you didn't
say, "nice shifting."

541
00:33:01,746 --> 00:33:04,510
- Don't worry about it.
- You really like that girl, huh?

542
00:33:04,682 --> 00:33:06,513
- Rachel? No.
- Yes, you do.

543
00:33:07,251 --> 00:33:08,445
- Mr. Robinson!
- Hey.

544
00:33:08,619 --> 00:33:09,608
- Welcome!
- Hey.

545
00:33:09,787 --> 00:33:12,347
- I am very big fan.
- How you doing? You a fan too?

546
00:33:12,523 --> 00:33:16,015
It's going around, baby. How you
doing? Kelly Robinson, 57 and 0.

547
00:33:16,194 --> 00:33:18,424
- You got that?
- No, no, no, I'm with him.

548
00:33:18,596 --> 00:33:22,396
Kelly! Tell these guys
I'm with you. I'm with the boxer.

549
00:33:22,567 --> 00:33:25,798
I've never seen that man before.
Shoot him in his ass.

550
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:28,564
- Hey, no, he's...
- I'm just playing. It's a joke.

551
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:31,868
Don't shoot the guy. He's with me.
Sorry about that, guys.

552
00:33:32,043 --> 00:33:33,408
That's a bad start.

553
00:33:33,578 --> 00:33:36,274
That's revenge for the hotel.
Now we're even.

554
00:33:36,447 --> 00:33:38,972
Okay, you did your job.
Now let me do mine.

555
00:33:40,585 --> 00:33:45,352
Yeah. Yeah. All right.
Yeah. Yeah.

556
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:47,718
Kelly Robinson, y'all, in the flesh.

557
00:33:48,126 --> 00:33:52,586
Y'all looking at the fastest man in the
world! Y'all can do better than that!

558
00:33:53,131 --> 00:33:57,295
Y'all ready for the Slugfest
in Budapest? That's good.

559
00:33:57,468 --> 00:33:58,730
Yeah! How y'all doing?

560
00:33:58,903 --> 00:34:01,736
Hello, Mr. Robinson.
This is great honor to meet you.

561
00:34:01,906 --> 00:34:05,967
Hey, look, it's an honor for me to let
you meet me. How about that, huh?

562
00:34:06,144 --> 00:34:08,237
All right, good meeting you.
Take it easy.

563
00:34:08,413 --> 00:34:10,506
I like him. I like the way he talks.

564
00:34:10,681 --> 00:34:13,673
- You just met Marwan Motaheeshi.
- Who's that?

565
00:34:13,851 --> 00:34:18,686
He controls death squads. They kill
thousands of people every year.

566
00:34:18,856 --> 00:34:20,619
Man.

567
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:24,460
- All right, here he comes.
- Okay, that's Gundars?

568
00:34:24,629 --> 00:34:27,393
- That's a bad-ass jacket he got on.
- Turn around.

569
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:29,999
- Yeah, okay.
- Disappear. Get away.

570
00:34:30,168 --> 00:34:33,262
- I won't disappear. I'll do the pen.
- Give me the pen. Give...

571
00:34:33,438 --> 00:34:36,066
- Back up before...
- Mr. Robinson. Good to meet you.

572
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:37,969
Mr. Gundars, the pleasure's mine.

573
00:34:38,142 --> 00:34:41,737
Thank you. Your fight here promises
to be the most exciting event...

574
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:44,074
...that Budapest has seen
in some time.

575
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:45,772
Since you such a nice guy...

576
00:34:45,950 --> 00:34:48,282
...I ain't gonna break
your boy up too bad.

577
00:34:48,453 --> 00:34:49,852
- Thank you
- Yeah. Yeah.

578
00:34:50,021 --> 00:34:52,148
- Mr. Robinson, your champagne.
- Thank you.

579
00:34:52,323 --> 00:34:56,123
I'm sorry to interrupt you. One
of the ladies wants an autograph.

580
00:34:56,294 --> 00:35:00,060
No problem at all, but
you have a pen I could use?

581
00:35:00,565 --> 00:35:01,554
I don't.

582
00:35:01,732 --> 00:35:04,166
Didn't I tell you at all times
to keep a pen?

583
00:35:04,335 --> 00:35:06,895
- I apologize.
- My assistant's penless.

584
00:35:07,071 --> 00:35:09,869
- It won't happen again.
- I said to have a pen...

585
00:35:10,041 --> 00:35:12,635
Mr. Gundars.
Mr. Gundars is always prepared.

586
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:18,271
Thank you. Hold this champagne.
You have to be prepared.

587
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:20,474
I'm disappointed,
I want you to know.

588
00:35:20,651 --> 00:35:22,812
Take that. Here you go.

589
00:35:23,821 --> 00:35:28,588
Clown ass. It's hard to get somebody
that'll do their job the right way.

590
00:35:28,759 --> 00:35:33,492
I'm sorry about that. Force of habit.
Here's your pen, Mr. Gundars.

591
00:35:36,434 --> 00:35:39,198
- Well, enjoy the party.
- Yeah.

592
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:41,463
Nice to see you.
I have some business.

593
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:44,574
Take care of your business.
Take care of your business.

594
00:35:44,742 --> 00:35:46,937
Hey, you a real player.

595
00:35:47,111 --> 00:35:49,671
Gundars.

596
00:35:50,348 --> 00:35:52,646
I had it under control
until you showed up.

597
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:54,216
I know you did.

598
00:35:54,385 --> 00:35:57,377
Okay, he's taking off.
I need you to create a distraction.

599
00:35:57,555 --> 00:36:00,046
Create a distraction?
What do you mean? Do what?

600
00:36:00,224 --> 00:36:03,387
Make a scene or do something.
That should come easy for you.

601
00:36:03,561 --> 00:36:05,654
Make a scene?

602
00:36:06,764 --> 00:36:09,198
Yeah! Baddest man on the planet!

603
00:36:09,367 --> 00:36:13,394
Cedric Mills, where you at? Come on,
everybody. Cedric, where you at?

604
00:36:13,571 --> 00:36:16,131
Let's get a show going here.
Where's Cedric Mills?

605
00:36:16,307 --> 00:36:18,400
Everybody gather around.
Hey, come on.

606
00:36:18,576 --> 00:36:21,841
Break that up. Come on,
y'all look great, but get out the ring.

607
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:24,982
It's about me and Cedric.
Cedric Mills, where you at?

608
00:36:25,149 --> 00:36:26,844
Hey, Cedric! You in the house?

609
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:29,213
I know I seen you!
There you go, Cedric.

610
00:36:29,387 --> 00:36:32,879
What you doing down there?
Having a steroid cocktail?

611
00:36:33,057 --> 00:36:34,615
I do not take the steroids.

612
00:36:34,792 --> 00:36:37,283
You need something
if you get in the ring with me.

613
00:36:37,461 --> 00:36:39,088
Let's give the people a preview.

614
00:36:39,263 --> 00:36:41,527
Don't be scared.
I ain't gonna hurt you.

615
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:46,830
Cedric Mills, everybody! In the flesh!
That's a brave man there.

616
00:36:47,004 --> 00:36:48,562
That's like swimming with Jaws.

617
00:36:51,275 --> 00:36:55,541
Well. Are you ready?

618
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:58,011
I want to see the plane first.

619
00:36:58,182 --> 00:37:01,276
Only the highest bidder
will have that privilege.

620
00:37:01,452 --> 00:37:04,444
Is it really invisible?

621
00:37:05,189 --> 00:37:08,056
How long have you been
in Budapest?

622
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:10,717
- Three days.
- Three days.

623
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:14,558
Well, you've probably driven past it
at least half a dozen times.

624
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:18,566
Now, if you'd enter your
bid into the computer.

625
00:37:26,377 --> 00:37:29,369
I usually make the predictions,
but let's do a little flip.

626
00:37:29,547 --> 00:37:35,452
Let's let Cedric make the predictions.
What round will I knock you out in?

627
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:36,848
Hey, you stop jokes now.

628
00:37:37,054 --> 00:37:38,419
- Or what?
- I will!

629
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:42,992
You gonna stop...? Isn't he a doll?
"I will stop them!" I like that.

630
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:46,857
Give them a preview. Open-handed.
Let's see how fast you are.

631
00:37:47,031 --> 00:37:50,023
Y'all like to see that, wouldn't you?
Open-handed scrap?

632
00:37:50,201 --> 00:37:54,399
Put your hands up. What you got?
That's what you coming with?

633
00:37:54,572 --> 00:37:56,335
You're gonna get your ass whipped.

634
00:37:56,507 --> 00:37:58,737
I'll hit your jaw.
Right jaw with left hand.

635
00:37:58,909 --> 00:38:02,868
Put your guard up, now. I'm pretty
fast, now. You ready? Here it come.

636
00:38:03,047 --> 00:38:06,107
I told you I would slap you.
Why didn't you block the punch?

637
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:08,980
What's wrong with you,
coming all hard like that?

638
00:38:09,153 --> 00:38:12,247
You're supposed to give them
a taste. You wanna hit me hard.

639
00:38:12,423 --> 00:38:14,789
What if I kick your ass
in front of everybody?

640
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:16,483
There you go! A preview.

641
00:38:16,661 --> 00:38:20,119
Robinson vs. Mills.
The transatlantic championship...

642
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:22,766
...tomorrow night, here in Budapest.

643
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:27,729
- Done.
- Excellent.

644
00:38:28,439 --> 00:38:31,567
Well, the best of luck.

645
00:38:31,742 --> 00:38:33,642
Thank you.

646
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:38,775
Would you care for champagne?
We have an excellent fountain.

647
00:38:38,949 --> 00:38:39,938
Yes.

648
00:38:40,117 --> 00:38:42,984
An undetectable
nuclear delivery system...

649
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:46,920
...could transform your tiny
country into a superpower.

650
00:39:19,256 --> 00:39:21,884
What you doing, hanging
from the ceiling like that?

651
00:39:22,059 --> 00:39:24,653
What are you doing?
You're supposed to be outside.

652
00:39:24,829 --> 00:39:27,457
- I figured you'd need help.
- Don't walk in here.

653
00:39:27,631 --> 00:39:29,792
Don't tell me what to do.
I'm Kelly Robinson.

654
00:39:29,967 --> 00:39:32,663
57 and 0. Don't talk to me like that.
What's wrong?

655
00:39:32,837 --> 00:39:35,067
You tripped the alarm.
Yeah, you tripped it.

656
00:39:35,239 --> 00:39:37,400
I didn't trip no alarm.
I don't hear it.

657
00:39:37,575 --> 00:39:39,600
See this?

658
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:42,103
- Oh, shit.
- Yeah, oh, shit. Come here.

659
00:39:42,279 --> 00:39:45,180
We'll get caught because
you didn't tell me about the alarm.

660
00:39:45,349 --> 00:39:47,010
- This is your fault.
- Put that on.

661
00:39:47,184 --> 00:39:49,209
- What is this?
- It's a mask. Put it on.

662
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:51,321
- This look like a sock.
- It's a mask.

663
00:39:51,489 --> 00:39:53,252
It's a special spy mask. Put it on.

664
00:39:53,424 --> 00:39:55,119
Look like a sock.

665
00:39:55,292 --> 00:39:57,419
Hey, man, this is a sock!
What you doing?

666
00:39:57,595 --> 00:39:59,256
Putting this on.
Let me do this.

667
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:00,419
Quit tickling me.

668
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:01,857
Would you come here?

669
00:40:02,032 --> 00:40:04,660
- Just tell me what's going on.
- I am losing it.

670
00:40:04,835 --> 00:40:06,996
I'm nervous and ticklish
at the same time.

671
00:40:07,171 --> 00:40:10,766
Not in my wildest imagination did
I dream it would be this difficult.

672
00:40:10,941 --> 00:40:14,934
Before you enter your bid,
Mr. Abi, let me remind you...

673
00:40:15,112 --> 00:40:17,637
...that an undetectable
nuclear delivery system...

674
00:40:17,815 --> 00:40:19,214
- Why we spinning?
- Be still.

675
00:40:19,383 --> 00:40:21,715
- Don't breathe.
- We can't spin like this.

676
00:40:21,886 --> 00:40:23,854
- It's cracking.
- I'm getting queasy...

677
00:40:24,021 --> 00:40:28,321
...and I don't like heights. And I'm
spinning, and I'm gonna vomit.

678
00:40:31,061 --> 00:40:34,497
What kind of cheap-ass equipment
they send you on this mission with?

679
00:40:34,665 --> 00:40:37,327
- The anchor broke.
- You check the anchor first.

680
00:40:37,501 --> 00:40:40,402
I wasn't expecting you to be here.

681
00:40:40,738 --> 00:40:41,830
Hey, that's cool.

682
00:40:42,006 --> 00:40:44,031
The funds will be verified
overnight...

683
00:40:44,208 --> 00:40:46,802
...and the highest bidder
will be informed tomorrow.

684
00:40:46,977 --> 00:40:49,605
I would like you to enjoy
our local specialty.

685
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:52,715
Sir? Sir.

686
00:40:54,051 --> 00:40:57,214
The silent alarm has just been
set off.

687
00:40:59,256 --> 00:41:02,089
Please, I need a few moments alone.

688
00:41:02,259 --> 00:41:03,920
- What about my bid?
- Don't worry.

689
00:41:04,094 --> 00:41:06,528
You'll get your chance. Enjoy.

690
00:41:06,697 --> 00:41:08,892
Lock the door.

691
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:19,738
Get on the roof.

692
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:22,572
- Just go through the opening.
- Don't make me fall.

693
00:41:22,746 --> 00:41:25,715
- Go through it.
- Lock this wing down.

694
00:41:26,083 --> 00:41:29,678
I was born semipsychic, and I had
a hunch something would happen.

695
00:41:29,854 --> 00:41:33,017
- Then why'd you go into the room?
- I ain't Miss Cleo.

696
00:41:34,892 --> 00:41:36,917
They are on the dome.

697
00:41:37,094 --> 00:41:40,530
It's like you're a double agent.
Like you're working against me.

698
00:41:40,698 --> 00:41:42,393
Just get them. Now.

699
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:48,827
Oh, man!

700
00:41:53,878 --> 00:41:56,870
- I liked this better when it was a test!
- We gotta jump!

701
00:41:57,047 --> 00:41:59,038
What?

702
00:41:59,216 --> 00:42:01,684
- You crazy? I ain't jumping.
- Got a better idea?

703
00:42:01,852 --> 00:42:04,821
No, but you better
come up with something.

704
00:42:04,989 --> 00:42:06,957
Okay, new plan. Wait right here.

705
00:42:07,124 --> 00:42:08,887
What you gonna do?
Don't leave me.

706
00:42:09,059 --> 00:42:11,323
- What's that?
- What?

707
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:14,222
Oh, God!

708
00:42:19,503 --> 00:42:23,337
- Okay, that wasn't that bad.
- What'd I say? Are your legs numb?

709
00:42:23,507 --> 00:42:25,668
No, come on. Let's do it.
What's next?

710
00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:29,502
Rule number one: Always have
a sure way out. Walk, walk, walk.

711
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:34,083
- Hey! You guys!
- Run, run. Now we run. Now we run.

712
00:42:48,832 --> 00:42:52,029
- This is your sure way out?
- It's the way to the sure way out.

713
00:42:52,202 --> 00:42:55,933
- Go through it.
- Come on, man!

714
00:43:03,981 --> 00:43:07,314
Could you move? Look out.
Lose the jacket!

715
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:11,220
Are we still on the way
to the sure way, or is this it?

716
00:43:11,388 --> 00:43:13,049
This is the sure way out.

717
00:43:13,223 --> 00:43:15,453
Okay. Come on.

718
00:43:15,626 --> 00:43:17,184
It's slow. I'm nervous.

719
00:43:17,361 --> 00:43:19,454
- Don't panic.
- Look how slow we moving!

720
00:43:25,035 --> 00:43:27,560
Kelly, it's here.
We are home free, my friend.

721
00:43:27,738 --> 00:43:29,137
There's a guy coming.

722
00:43:29,306 --> 00:43:31,001
Kick him.
Kick him in the balls!

723
00:43:31,175 --> 00:43:33,075
How I'm gonna kick him
if he got a gun?

724
00:43:33,243 --> 00:43:37,339
- Don't be defeatist! Stay on my side!
- Hey, watch out!

725
00:43:42,853 --> 00:43:44,878
They're gonna kill Kelly Robinson.

726
00:43:45,055 --> 00:43:47,387
Don't be negative.
Check outside!

727
00:43:47,558 --> 00:43:49,219
Hey, that guy's still coming.

728
00:43:49,393 --> 00:43:51,258
I'm gonna get him.
I'm gonna get him.

729
00:43:51,428 --> 00:43:52,759
- Tell me when. Now?
- No!

730
00:43:52,930 --> 00:43:55,831
- Now?
- Now!

731
00:43:56,734 --> 00:43:59,066
- Okay.
- Throw it. Lob it over there!

732
00:43:59,236 --> 00:44:01,136
- What's this?
- Smoke grenade.

733
00:44:01,305 --> 00:44:03,899
- They got bullets and we got smoke?
- Lob it!

734
00:44:07,077 --> 00:44:09,045
It's smoking.

735
00:44:10,114 --> 00:44:11,706
- Now what?
- Here. Grab this.

736
00:44:17,454 --> 00:44:19,445
I knew you had something
up your sleeve.

737
00:44:19,623 --> 00:44:21,420
- Of course.
- I never doubted you.

738
00:44:21,592 --> 00:44:25,084
- That's right.
- Yeah. All right. Okay.

739
00:44:25,262 --> 00:44:27,389
How we gonna
get down from here?

740
00:44:27,564 --> 00:44:30,260
I don't think we're gonna have
to worry about that.

741
00:44:33,070 --> 00:44:34,628
Okay, you worried now?

742
00:44:34,805 --> 00:44:36,739
I'm a little worried now.

743
00:44:36,907 --> 00:44:39,899
We'll bring her gently down
on that grassy hill there.

744
00:44:40,077 --> 00:44:42,341
We're going down faster than I want.

745
00:44:42,513 --> 00:44:43,775
Get ready!
Brace yourself!

746
00:44:43,947 --> 00:44:45,437
What?

747
00:44:49,453 --> 00:44:51,887
Hey, what happened
to the soft, grassy hill?

748
00:44:52,056 --> 00:44:54,081
We missed it.

749
00:44:59,563 --> 00:45:00,825
Let go when I say so.

750
00:45:00,998 --> 00:45:02,898
Hey, man, I'm not letting go.

751
00:45:03,067 --> 00:45:05,365
You wanna die?
We've dodged some bullets...

752
00:45:05,536 --> 00:45:08,972
...and I don't know how many more
lives we've got. We gotta let go.

753
00:45:10,307 --> 00:45:11,638
Ready?

754
00:45:11,809 --> 00:45:14,243
Get set. Let go!

755
00:45:15,412 --> 00:45:16,936
I broke my leg. It's broken.

756
00:45:17,114 --> 00:45:20,174
That's what your ass gets
for this crazy balloon shit.

757
00:45:20,350 --> 00:45:22,341
Kelly Robinson
hanging from a balloon.

758
00:45:22,519 --> 00:45:26,615
- No, it's okay. It's okay.
- I wish it was broke.

759
00:45:33,997 --> 00:45:36,795
- They're still coming.
- Man, these guys won't give up.

760
00:45:36,967 --> 00:45:39,367
- Now what?
- I wish that balloon worked better.

761
00:45:39,536 --> 00:45:41,766
The balloon is over!
What are we gonna do?

762
00:45:41,939 --> 00:45:43,270
Let me think. Hold on.

763
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:45,840
I got an idea. Move around.
Get in the car.

764
00:45:46,009 --> 00:45:48,341
You've got an idea?
This I want to see.

765
00:45:48,512 --> 00:45:50,605
Now you be in the hot seat.

766
00:45:59,456 --> 00:46:01,356
I used to be in a different business.

767
00:46:01,525 --> 00:46:04,085
- What are you doing?
- They keep the keys here. See?

768
00:46:04,261 --> 00:46:07,924
- What? You used to transport cars?
- Something like that.

769
00:46:10,067 --> 00:46:11,557
Here we go.

770
00:46:31,855 --> 00:46:33,720
You did it.
Show them something there.

771
00:46:35,926 --> 00:46:38,053
- Hey!
- Okay, I got an idea.

772
00:46:38,228 --> 00:46:40,423
- What you gonna do?
- You inspired me.

773
00:46:40,864 --> 00:46:43,765
We're gonna try a little Carlos.

774
00:46:47,004 --> 00:46:48,835
- What are you doing?
- Pull forward.

775
00:46:49,239 --> 00:46:51,366
- What?
- Pull forward.

776
00:46:57,748 --> 00:46:59,773
- Did you see that?
- Goddamn!

777
00:46:59,950 --> 00:47:03,113
- That was a big explosion.
- Man!

778
00:47:08,192 --> 00:47:10,888
That's why they think Carlos
is a better spy than me!

779
00:47:11,061 --> 00:47:13,086
- Carlos?
- Everyone thinks he's great.

780
00:47:13,263 --> 00:47:16,027
- He's got more potent bombs.
- His bombs are more potent?

781
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:17,599
That ain't right.

782
00:47:17,768 --> 00:47:19,201
Another one!
Here they come.

783
00:47:19,369 --> 00:47:20,358
This one's mine.

784
00:47:20,537 --> 00:47:23,734
Let me show you something they
don't teach over at the BNS.

785
00:47:35,652 --> 00:47:37,620
Oh, wow. That's pretty good.

786
00:47:41,058 --> 00:47:43,959
- You were unbelievable back there.
- That was you.

787
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:48,325
You had the thing going down, the
Kelly Robinson... I had one little bomb.

788
00:47:48,498 --> 00:47:50,295
- Little bomb?
- It was like...

789
00:47:50,467 --> 00:47:52,094
- You're crazy.
- Here they are.

790
00:48:01,411 --> 00:48:04,141
- Good driving.
- Kelly Robinson, Kelly Robinson.

791
00:48:08,151 --> 00:48:09,448
What we got here?

792
00:48:09,620 --> 00:48:11,645
Hey, no outlet in here.
We stuck, man.

793
00:48:11,822 --> 00:48:16,122
Hey, pull over here. Pull right here.
Stop, stop, stop. Give me the keys.

794
00:48:16,293 --> 00:48:19,626
Look what I got! Keys!
Convertible. It's all yours.

795
00:48:19,796 --> 00:48:22,287
You take that car.
We'll take your scooter.

796
00:48:22,466 --> 00:48:23,933
Jump on. Jump on!

797
00:48:24,101 --> 00:48:27,036
Kelly Robinson ain't getting on
no scooter like no bitch.

798
00:48:27,337 --> 00:48:29,532
All right. Okay, let's do it.
Come on, man.

799
00:48:29,706 --> 00:48:32,675
Get your feet up.
Okay. Hold on!

800
00:48:39,650 --> 00:48:43,086
- Hold on. Okay, hold on.
- I am holding on.

801
00:48:47,457 --> 00:48:49,152
Shit!

802
00:48:52,796 --> 00:48:54,354
Go, go, go!

803
00:48:58,835 --> 00:49:01,565
- It's a nightmare!
- Yeah, it's a nightmare.

804
00:49:01,738 --> 00:49:04,104
They shooting, and I'm in the back.

805
00:49:06,343 --> 00:49:09,744
- Better come up with something.
- We'll make a break for daylight.

806
00:49:09,913 --> 00:49:11,904
Tuck your elbows in.

807
00:49:31,768 --> 00:49:35,932
What's that smell?
Oh, man.

808
00:49:36,106 --> 00:49:38,233
Go down the tunnel.

809
00:49:40,510 --> 00:49:43,206
- This is the sewer!
- We're stuck. Is there an opening?

810
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:46,008
There's bars and shit over here.
We can't get out.

811
00:49:46,183 --> 00:49:47,912
Just stand back to the side.

812
00:49:48,085 --> 00:49:50,315
Oh, shit!

813
00:49:51,388 --> 00:49:53,515
You okay?

814
00:49:53,690 --> 00:49:57,820
I made $24 million last year, and I'm
standing in a river of human sludge.

815
00:49:57,995 --> 00:49:59,121
You ask me, am I okay!

816
00:49:59,296 --> 00:50:02,891
You made $24 million last year?

817
00:50:03,066 --> 00:50:04,693
Yeah, 24.7.

818
00:50:07,604 --> 00:50:10,437
- They ain't leaving.
- It's late night.

819
00:50:10,607 --> 00:50:14,065
- We'll wait them out.
- Shit, it stinks down here.

820
00:50:14,244 --> 00:50:16,235
Just don't breathe in too deep.

821
00:50:16,413 --> 00:50:19,405
Methane.
Methane'll make you loopy.

822
00:50:19,583 --> 00:50:24,020
I'm gonna get loopy from standing
and breathing in this human...

823
00:50:24,187 --> 00:50:26,121
You know what this is, right?

824
00:50:26,289 --> 00:50:29,884
This is the nastiest place
in all of Hungary.

825
00:50:30,060 --> 00:50:32,187
You feeling loopy? You look loopy.

826
00:50:32,362 --> 00:50:36,560
Yes. It feels kind of dizzy.
I got a buzz.

827
00:50:38,502 --> 00:50:40,367
Okay.

828
00:50:41,171 --> 00:50:43,264
- Where'd you grow up?
- Hey, man...

829
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:46,898
...no offense, but I ain't one
of those guys that, you know...

830
00:50:47,077 --> 00:50:50,444
...start pouring his heart out
and get personal with another guy...

831
00:50:50,614 --> 00:50:53,845
...so save it for somebody else.

832
00:50:54,017 --> 00:50:56,884
My grandmother raised me.
My grandmother.

833
00:50:57,054 --> 00:50:58,043
No kidding?

834
00:50:58,221 --> 00:51:00,712
Yeah, she's the one
that put the time in.

835
00:51:00,891 --> 00:51:04,156
The day-to-day, you know,
feeding, and you know.

836
00:51:04,327 --> 00:51:05,726
Sounds like a sweet woman.

837
00:51:05,896 --> 00:51:10,731
Sweet! The sweetest thing
you ever wanna meet.

838
00:51:10,901 --> 00:51:15,531
Angel. My grandmother's the first
person ever punched me in the face.

839
00:51:15,705 --> 00:51:19,436
None of that hard shit, a jab,
just to let me know she was serious.

840
00:51:19,609 --> 00:51:21,440
Parents don't take the time anymore.

841
00:51:21,611 --> 00:51:24,171
No, that's love, you know.
I mean, only...

842
00:51:24,347 --> 00:51:27,373
You got to love somebody's baby
to punch a baby in the face.

843
00:51:27,551 --> 00:51:32,113
Kelly Robinson was a scared little
boy. That's all. A scared little boy.

844
00:51:32,289 --> 00:51:34,018
Keep going. Keep digging.

845
00:51:34,191 --> 00:51:39,060
I mean, I put on a show, but inside,
man, lots of time I be crying.

846
00:51:44,534 --> 00:51:45,865
You ready for a bomb?

847
00:51:46,269 --> 00:51:47,566
Tell me.

848
00:51:47,737 --> 00:51:50,103
You and I are basically
the same guy.

849
00:51:50,273 --> 00:51:53,299
Take away the boxing,
take away the money...

850
00:51:53,477 --> 00:51:54,671
Take away my money?

851
00:51:55,212 --> 00:51:57,476
It's a metaphor.

852
00:51:57,647 --> 00:52:00,707
Take away all your women.

853
00:52:00,884 --> 00:52:05,821
Take away all the trappings
of success.

854
00:52:05,989 --> 00:52:07,889
And you and I are the same guy.

855
00:52:08,492 --> 00:52:11,518
- You know what I'm saying?
- Yeah, I know. I know. I'm you.

856
00:52:11,695 --> 00:52:15,597
- No, I'm you.
- Yeah, that's what I mean.

857
00:52:15,765 --> 00:52:18,700
We're twins.

858
00:52:21,671 --> 00:52:24,504
Oh, I've got a crush
on Rachel for years.

859
00:52:24,674 --> 00:52:26,904
I just love her power.

860
00:52:27,077 --> 00:52:29,944
And sexy and... You saw
the way she threw me over.

861
00:52:30,113 --> 00:52:32,843
It was just like I was nothing.
Just a powerful woman.

862
00:52:33,183 --> 00:52:37,449
You know what? I'll tell you what.
If you feel that way about a girl...

863
00:52:37,621 --> 00:52:39,851
...then you got to act on it.
- Oh, I do.

864
00:52:40,023 --> 00:52:42,218
You see how it is when I try
to talk to her.

865
00:52:42,392 --> 00:52:44,451
- You gotta...
- Fumbling over myself...

866
00:52:44,628 --> 00:52:46,425
I see, but you need to change that.

867
00:52:46,596 --> 00:52:50,259
- Be honest. We're in the sewer.
- Hey, I ain't gonna lie to you. What?

868
00:52:50,433 --> 00:52:53,925
I don't have the savoir-faire,
that devilish charm.

869
00:52:54,104 --> 00:52:57,540
- I've seen you, and I don't have that.
- I beg to differ. I disagree.

870
00:52:57,707 --> 00:53:00,403
No, I'm not gonna sit here
and listen to your...

871
00:53:00,577 --> 00:53:02,977
Bust it, bust it.
You do have savoir-faire.

872
00:53:03,146 --> 00:53:06,309
You just have to unleash it.

873
00:53:06,716 --> 00:53:12,348
Unleash it.
Unleash your savoir-faire.

874
00:53:12,656 --> 00:53:14,419
I don't know.

875
00:53:14,591 --> 00:53:20,086
You know, if you forget that this is a
sewer, it's kind of a beautiful place.

876
00:53:30,774 --> 00:53:33,971
Thank God! What happened?
I thought you two were dead.

877
00:53:34,144 --> 00:53:36,544
- Gundars' men had us pinned.
- Did they see you?

878
00:53:36,713 --> 00:53:38,442
No. Have you been tracking
the pen?

879
00:53:38,615 --> 00:53:40,742
It's at the palace.
He moved until 1:30...

880
00:53:40,917 --> 00:53:43,715
...and it's been in the bedroom
since. He's not onto us.

881
00:53:43,887 --> 00:53:46,185
Let us know, Jim, the minute
that pen moves.

882
00:53:46,356 --> 00:53:49,621
The plane is still in Budapest,
but the deal's going down today.

883
00:53:49,793 --> 00:53:51,454
Bob, get a helicopter in the air.

884
00:53:51,628 --> 00:53:54,927
Scan every rooftop, parking lot,
playground in the city.

885
00:53:55,098 --> 00:53:57,589
UV, infrared, throw
everything you got at it.

886
00:53:58,201 --> 00:54:00,692
We're on it.

887
00:54:05,175 --> 00:54:06,301
Just zoom in on it.

888
00:54:06,476 --> 00:54:07,807
Rachel, you look bad.

889
00:54:10,847 --> 00:54:14,806
Tired. You must be exhausted.

890
00:54:14,985 --> 00:54:16,043
What a night.

891
00:54:16,219 --> 00:54:18,551
I was driving around,
looking for you all night.

892
00:54:18,722 --> 00:54:22,021
Why don't you go take a nap?
We'll give a yell if the pen moves.

893
00:54:22,192 --> 00:54:23,716
Sure you guys can handle this?

894
00:54:23,893 --> 00:54:27,385
You've been working hard. I'm sure
he got this covered. Take a nap.

895
00:54:27,564 --> 00:54:31,591
All right, maybe I will for a sec,
but call me if anything happens.

896
00:54:32,168 --> 00:54:33,226
I'm glad you're okay.

897
00:54:33,503 --> 00:54:35,698
All right. Thank you.

898
00:54:38,008 --> 00:54:40,203
Oh, yeah.

899
00:54:40,510 --> 00:54:43,411
I know what you thinking,
and the answer is yes, playboy.

900
00:54:43,580 --> 00:54:46,344
- Yes. You going in there.
- I'm not going in there.

901
00:54:46,516 --> 00:54:49,110
You are going, and you gonna be
devilishly charming.

902
00:54:49,286 --> 00:54:52,551
- This isn't one of your floozies.
- It's a girl. A girl's a girl.

903
00:54:52,722 --> 00:54:55,054
She's special. You gotta
put her on a pedestal.

904
00:54:55,225 --> 00:54:58,524
Well, we don't have a pedestal.
All we got is a cot in the back.

905
00:54:59,362 --> 00:55:01,387
- I'll do it tomorrow.
- No, today...

906
00:55:01,564 --> 00:55:03,862
...right now on the cot in the back.

907
00:55:04,034 --> 00:55:05,729
- I don't know.
- I do know.

908
00:55:05,902 --> 00:55:07,802
- Okay.
- Let's do it.

909
00:55:07,971 --> 00:55:10,439
I know you in a good mood now.
Let's do it.

910
00:55:12,375 --> 00:55:15,401
You can be charming as hell.
I'll show you how we'll do it.

911
00:55:15,578 --> 00:55:18,638
I'm gonna unleash
your savoir-faire.

912
00:55:21,685 --> 00:55:24,153
Hey, it's me, Alex.

913
00:55:24,554 --> 00:55:26,283
Alex?

914
00:55:26,623 --> 00:55:27,954
I love the way
you say my name.

915
00:55:28,124 --> 00:55:30,285
It's the way the L
flicks off your tongue...

916
00:55:30,460 --> 00:55:32,052
...when you say
the L in Alex.

917
00:55:32,228 --> 00:55:35,561
It's like the way the L
flicks off your tongue.

918
00:55:35,732 --> 00:55:38,792
It's like, "Alex, Alex, Alex."

919
00:55:38,968 --> 00:55:43,029
Say it one more time for me.
Just let me hear you say it.

920
00:55:43,206 --> 00:55:44,571
What are you doing?

921
00:55:47,610 --> 00:55:50,807
What am I doing?
I'm just...

922
00:55:50,980 --> 00:55:53,915
I'm getting ready to make love
to you so good and long...

923
00:55:54,084 --> 00:55:57,576
...you'll be begging me to stop
and keep going at the same time.

924
00:55:58,121 --> 00:56:00,316
I'll tell you what I'm doing.

925
00:56:00,924 --> 00:56:03,119
I'm getting ready to...

926
00:56:05,829 --> 00:56:08,923
Baby, I'm gonna make
sure that you're okay.

927
00:56:09,099 --> 00:56:12,330
Now that I see that you are,
you're all tucked in, doing fine...

928
00:56:12,502 --> 00:56:16,233
...l'm gonna go back out. Everything's
fine here. Don't worry about us.

929
00:56:16,406 --> 00:56:19,432
Go back to sleep. Don't...
Forget I came in. I'll just...

930
00:56:19,609 --> 00:56:23,477
That's not what I said. Hey!
Get back in there!

931
00:56:23,646 --> 00:56:26,308
No!
Your rap's not working.

932
00:56:26,483 --> 00:56:29,008
Try tomorrow. We did our best.
No shame in that.

933
00:56:29,185 --> 00:56:32,848
Kelly Robinson's rap works! Get your
ass back there. This is good shit.

934
00:56:34,524 --> 00:56:35,752
Give me...

935
00:56:35,925 --> 00:56:40,123
Hey, I'm just... I'm sorry
to keep barging in like this.

936
00:56:40,296 --> 00:56:41,729
I just wanna...

937
00:56:41,898 --> 00:56:45,231
Let me just take a...
Just collect myself for a second.

938
00:56:45,402 --> 00:56:48,565
I have something that I want
to say, and if you don't mind...

939
00:56:48,738 --> 00:56:50,501
...I just have a...

940
00:56:50,673 --> 00:56:53,107
It's like a story that I feel
I need to tell you.

941
00:56:53,276 --> 00:56:55,801
That's good. I'm gonna
give you my secret weapon.

942
00:56:55,979 --> 00:56:57,970
This shit always works.
Now listen, now.

943
00:56:58,148 --> 00:56:59,513
Look in her eyes.

944
00:57:01,885 --> 00:57:02,874
Now sing.

945
00:57:10,627 --> 00:57:11,616
Say that.

946
00:57:11,795 --> 00:57:13,695
Baby, when I woke up
this morning...

947
00:57:13,863 --> 00:57:16,832
...I felt like there was a sea
storming inside of me.

948
00:57:18,168 --> 00:57:19,157
Inside of me.

949
00:57:26,176 --> 00:57:28,508
And baby...

950
00:57:28,778 --> 00:57:31,679
...I think I'm capsizing.

951
00:57:31,848 --> 00:57:35,841
I think I'm capsizing,
and the waves just keep rising.

952
00:57:36,853 --> 00:57:37,717
Rising.

953
00:57:38,822 --> 00:57:41,188
Rising and...

954
00:57:47,664 --> 00:57:49,962
When I get that feeling...

955
00:57:51,201 --> 00:57:56,298
...I need sexual healing.
I just need it. I just need it.

956
00:57:56,473 --> 00:57:59,135
Sexual... I know,
it sounds crazy. I'm just...

957
00:57:59,309 --> 00:58:04,337
I'm probably delirious,
but it just makes me feel so fine.

958
00:58:06,049 --> 00:58:07,573
And it's good for us.

959
00:58:11,287 --> 00:58:15,451
It's sexual.
It's healing. Okay?

960
00:58:16,092 --> 00:58:18,185
I don't know what else
I can say.

961
00:58:18,361 --> 00:58:19,919
You're cute.

962
00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:22,855
I've always had
a little crush on you.

963
00:58:23,032 --> 00:58:25,193
- I told you!
- Really? You did?

964
00:58:27,370 --> 00:58:29,964
- I'm hot. It's hot in here, isn't it?
- My gosh.

965
00:58:30,139 --> 00:58:32,039
Good Lord.

966
00:58:34,110 --> 00:58:36,874
Shit, yeah, that's
what I'm talking about.

967
00:58:37,447 --> 00:58:40,575
Now go over there, and
bite her on the ass real hard.

968
00:58:40,750 --> 00:58:41,910
- No!
- Yes!

969
00:58:42,085 --> 00:58:44,485
- No, no, no, no.
- No?

970
00:58:44,654 --> 00:58:46,144
No, no, no, no.
Yes to you.

971
00:58:46,322 --> 00:58:47,812
- Yes?
- Bite her. Bite her!

972
00:58:47,991 --> 00:58:48,980
- No!
- No?

973
00:58:49,158 --> 00:58:51,752
No, yes.
Go back to where you were.

974
00:58:51,928 --> 00:58:54,795
- I'm just... I'm...
- Bite! Bite! Bite her!

975
00:58:55,265 --> 00:58:56,630
They love that shit.

976
00:58:57,166 --> 00:59:01,466
Don't break the skin, but bite it good
so that there's a mark on her ass.

977
00:59:01,638 --> 00:59:04,869
She'll show all her friends.
"Look at my mark, what he did. "

978
00:59:06,309 --> 00:59:08,004
I know what you want.

979
00:59:12,749 --> 00:59:15,081
It's okay.
You can trust me.

980
00:59:23,826 --> 00:59:25,123
- My...
- You okay?

981
00:59:25,295 --> 00:59:28,196
I think you broke my spine.

982
00:59:29,465 --> 00:59:31,990
But in a good way.

983
00:59:39,008 --> 00:59:40,441
Hey!

984
00:59:41,144 --> 00:59:44,545
Hey, come on, now.
Let me at least see the goods.

985
00:59:47,383 --> 00:59:49,613
Hey, the pen just moved!
Let's go!

986
00:59:49,852 --> 00:59:51,843
Let's move!
Gotta go! Let's go!

987
00:59:52,255 --> 00:59:53,347
- Pen moved.
- No.

988
00:59:53,523 --> 00:59:55,684
- Are you sure?
- Come on. Yes.

989
01:00:03,566 --> 01:00:06,831
It looks like he's out of the car
and headed for the baths.

990
01:00:07,003 --> 01:00:08,903
Wait. Why is he
going to the baths?

991
01:00:09,072 --> 01:00:11,666
As long as he's not going
to a pen store, who cares?

992
01:00:11,841 --> 01:00:14,571
Stakeout. Stakeout.
Stakeout, guys.

993
01:00:14,744 --> 01:00:16,541
This needs a stakeout.

994
01:00:30,793 --> 01:00:34,024
- I'll take the back, okay?
- Wait a second. Be careful.

995
01:00:35,331 --> 01:00:37,162
You too, okay?

996
01:00:40,136 --> 01:00:42,661
Please. Come on, man.
Come on.

997
01:00:42,839 --> 01:00:42,939
You realize I can save the world
and make boxing history in one day?

998
01:00:42,939 --> 01:00:46,397
You realize I can save the world
and make boxing history in one day?

999
01:00:46,576 --> 01:00:48,544
- All right.
- They'll give me a parade.

1000
01:00:48,711 --> 01:00:51,305
Ticker-tape parade.
Confetti and all that shit.

1001
01:00:51,481 --> 01:00:53,676
Bigass parade.
Glitter.

1002
01:00:53,850 --> 01:00:55,044
Get my own day.

1003
01:00:56,419 --> 01:00:59,786
Kelly Day.
Kelly Robinson Day parade.

1004
01:01:01,024 --> 01:01:02,958
Nasty as hell up in here.

1005
01:01:03,126 --> 01:01:05,788
It smells like ass soup
all over the place.

1006
01:01:06,029 --> 01:01:08,259
- I just lost the signal.
- What?

1007
01:01:08,431 --> 01:01:10,865
Maybe the walls
are too thick in here.

1008
01:01:11,300 --> 01:01:13,666
No, no. Something's wrong.
Come on.

1009
01:01:13,836 --> 01:01:16,634
We can't walk away from this.
We got to get that plane!

1010
01:01:16,806 --> 01:01:20,173
You're fired up. I like your
enthusiasm, don't wanna lose it.

1011
01:01:20,343 --> 01:01:23,801
But sometimes you move forward,
sometimes back. We're moving back.

1012
01:01:23,980 --> 01:01:25,538
Hell, no! Listen to me.

1013
01:01:25,715 --> 01:01:28,377
I told you I was semipsychic.
I got a hunch on this.

1014
01:01:28,551 --> 01:01:31,315
Seven out of 10 of my hunches
are correct. That's a high ratio!

1015
01:01:31,487 --> 01:01:34,547
We got to go with them numbers.
Like, here, in this area...

1016
01:01:34,724 --> 01:01:37,921
...l'm vibing this. Right now,
I know the plane is in here.

1017
01:01:38,094 --> 01:01:39,527
Trust me on this.
Hey!

1018
01:01:39,696 --> 01:01:41,721
What you know
about the Leafy Bug?

1019
01:01:42,398 --> 01:01:43,831
What?

1020
01:01:44,667 --> 01:01:48,433
- Kick your ass if I find it in here.
- Kelly, Kelly, Kelly.

1021
01:01:48,905 --> 01:01:51,339
Hell, yeah. Come on, now.
You don't feel that?

1022
01:01:51,507 --> 01:01:54,874
- There's nothing in here.
- You must be crazy. I feel something.

1023
01:01:55,044 --> 01:01:56,909
A lot of old guys
hitting each other with sticks.

1024
01:01:57,080 --> 01:01:59,480
There's something else.
I feel it.

1025
01:01:59,649 --> 01:02:02,846
Something's going on in here.
Something's definitely going on.

1026
01:02:03,019 --> 01:02:04,213
What's your name, boy?

1027
01:02:05,688 --> 01:02:08,589
He talking all that shit
because he knows something.

1028
01:02:08,758 --> 01:02:10,282
Something's in here.
I feel it.

1029
01:02:10,460 --> 01:02:13,224
You know what?
We learned we can't trust your gut.

1030
01:02:13,396 --> 01:02:15,057
You can trust my gut.
I told you...

1031
01:02:15,231 --> 01:02:18,792
Maybe the plane's over there
in the whirlpool. We should check...

1032
01:02:18,968 --> 01:02:21,436
- Maybe those three out of 10...
- Gun!

1033
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:34,340
- You said there was a plane!
- I said, a vibe! A vibe!

1034
01:02:34,517 --> 01:02:35,711
Like a fool, I listened!

1035
01:02:40,556 --> 01:02:42,023
You got a way out of here?

1036
01:02:42,191 --> 01:02:44,853
I followed you in here.
Why would I have a way out?

1037
01:02:50,833 --> 01:02:53,996
- What are you shooting at?
- Trying to hit the pipes.

1038
01:02:55,872 --> 01:02:59,069
Throw this up there. We'll create
a spark. When I say ready. Go!

1039
01:03:02,645 --> 01:03:04,340
I got it. I got it.

1040
01:03:05,681 --> 01:03:07,979
It's gonna blow.
It's gonna blow!

1041
01:03:25,501 --> 01:03:27,435
We gotta warn Rachel.

1042
01:03:41,150 --> 01:03:42,378
There goes Gundars!

1043
01:03:42,885 --> 01:03:44,546
Rachel!

1044
01:03:45,188 --> 01:03:46,621
Rachel, no!

1045
01:03:46,889 --> 01:03:48,720
It's a setup!

1046
01:03:52,395 --> 01:03:53,862
No! No!

1047
01:04:01,404 --> 01:04:03,395
Man!

1048
01:04:07,476 --> 01:04:09,103
Let's go.

1049
01:04:10,513 --> 01:04:14,609
- That's it?
- Yeah, Kelly, that's it.

1050
01:04:16,886 --> 01:04:18,547
Shit!

1051
01:04:21,157 --> 01:04:22,886
- You all right?
- What do you think?

1052
01:04:23,059 --> 01:04:25,493
I think you're messed up,
and you need to talk.

1053
01:04:25,661 --> 01:04:27,526
Is that what you think?
Rachel's dead!

1054
01:04:27,697 --> 01:04:29,995
She's dead because I've been
listening to you. I'm done.

1055
01:04:30,166 --> 01:04:32,327
You're upset.
Rachel was a good woman.

1056
01:04:32,501 --> 01:04:35,231
She was a good woman,
and she's gone.

1057
01:04:35,404 --> 01:04:37,269
You're still here, though,
semipsychic guy.

1058
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:40,102
Wait. You ain't blaming
that back there on me.

1059
01:04:40,276 --> 01:04:42,904
No. Who could blame you?
It's not your fault.

1060
01:04:43,079 --> 01:04:46,014
You're the king of the universe.
You want Kelly Robinson Day.

1061
01:04:46,182 --> 01:04:49,049
- Have the parade. You'll get it.
- Slow it down. Back off.

1062
01:04:49,218 --> 01:04:51,152
I don't like your tone. You fixing
to get your ass whipped.

1063
01:04:51,320 --> 01:04:53,481
Really? Is that
one of your hunches?

1064
01:04:53,656 --> 01:04:55,954
Or some of the normal crap
that comes out of your mouth?

1065
01:04:56,125 --> 01:04:58,616
Remember what I said
about how we're the same guy?

1066
01:04:58,794 --> 01:05:00,955
I'm not you.
Thank God, I'm not you!

1067
01:05:01,130 --> 01:05:03,621
- I would hate to be you.
- All right.

1068
01:05:03,799 --> 01:05:07,064
That's the last straw.
I got to whup your ass now.

1069
01:05:07,236 --> 01:05:09,295
- You wanna fight me?
- I'll whip your ass!

1070
01:05:09,472 --> 01:05:11,963
Let me take off my jacket.
This is gonna amuse me.

1071
01:05:12,141 --> 01:05:14,837
If going to the dentist is amusing,
then this is getting ready to be funny.

1072
01:05:15,011 --> 01:05:17,707
- There's no ref here.
- I don't need no referee.

1073
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:21,145
From this position, I know 11 ways
I can totally immobilize you.

1074
01:05:21,317 --> 01:05:22,614
End your life right...

1075
01:05:22,785 --> 01:05:24,844
How much from that position?
Huh?

1076
01:05:25,021 --> 01:05:26,010
That was my left.

1077
01:05:26,188 --> 01:05:29,180
If it was my right, you'd be
drinking meat through a straw.

1078
01:05:31,727 --> 01:05:33,319
Will you look at surfer boy!

1079
01:05:33,496 --> 01:05:35,088
Show me some good spy shit.

1080
01:05:35,264 --> 01:05:36,253
Hey, shit!

1081
01:05:37,867 --> 01:05:41,359
If that had gone 6 inches higher,
you'd be in a coma right now.

1082
01:05:43,139 --> 01:05:44,401
You okay?

1083
01:05:44,573 --> 01:05:49,374
You know how to use your feet good.
Throw kicks like a little bitch!

1084
01:05:55,017 --> 01:05:56,575
You got me!

1085
01:05:56,752 --> 01:05:58,777
Hands up! What's going on here?

1086
01:05:59,021 --> 01:06:01,012
The black guy!
The black guy mugged me!

1087
01:06:03,225 --> 01:06:05,318
I'd like to file a complaint!
Wait!

1088
01:06:05,494 --> 01:06:07,860
Why am I being arrested?
Why am I being arrested?

1089
01:06:08,030 --> 01:06:11,522
This is bullshit! He kicked me first!
He kicked me in my nuts!

1090
01:06:11,701 --> 01:06:15,068
Why am I getting arrested
if I got kicked in my nuts?

1091
01:06:15,237 --> 01:06:18,832
How come you just arresting
the black man? My nuts was kicked!

1092
01:06:59,915 --> 01:07:01,109
- Yeah?
- Alex.

1093
01:07:01,283 --> 01:07:03,717
Where are you?
I've been calling for three hours!

1094
01:07:03,886 --> 01:07:05,911
I know.
We hit a few snags.

1095
01:07:06,088 --> 01:07:08,852
Snags? I'm sending backup now.
What's your location?

1096
01:07:09,025 --> 01:07:10,686
- It's all fine.
- It's all fine?

1097
01:07:10,860 --> 01:07:14,762
I'm headed to the castle tonight.
I'll try to track Gundars to the plane.

1098
01:07:14,930 --> 01:07:18,491
You don't know where it is yet?
I knew you'd screw this up. Look...

1099
01:07:18,667 --> 01:07:21,431
I gotta go, Mac.
I gotta go.

1100
01:07:30,079 --> 01:07:31,706
Dude never been this late.

1101
01:07:31,881 --> 01:07:33,940
The brother can't tell time no more.
That's the problem.

1102
01:07:34,116 --> 01:07:37,415
- Kelly! Where you been?
- Better yet, who you been with?

1103
01:07:37,586 --> 01:07:39,986
If you hang with us,
this shit wouldn't happen.

1104
01:07:40,156 --> 01:07:43,489
He ain't our problem no more.
Let's go down here and get 58.

1105
01:08:11,854 --> 01:08:15,221
Piece of shit microtracker.

1106
01:08:15,391 --> 01:08:17,359
You're a very lucky man,
Mr. Zhu Tam.

1107
01:08:17,526 --> 01:08:19,585
I feel like I just won the lottery.

1108
01:08:19,762 --> 01:08:23,721
It's funny, isn't it?
You winning makes me rich.

1109
01:08:24,233 --> 01:08:28,693
My government's point of view
is that no price is too high.

1110
01:08:28,871 --> 01:08:30,133
Clearly.

1111
01:08:32,608 --> 01:08:34,508
So how's your golf game?

1112
01:08:34,677 --> 01:08:37,009
I haven't had much time
since I've been here.

1113
01:08:52,027 --> 01:08:53,688
In the 15th hole. Eagle.

1114
01:08:53,863 --> 01:08:55,626
- First time ever.
- Really?

1115
01:09:26,695 --> 01:09:28,287
Yeah! This is it, baby!

1116
01:09:30,866 --> 01:09:34,063
Driver, take the car off the bridge,
away from the traffic.

1117
01:09:34,236 --> 01:09:35,498
I don't see it.

1118
01:09:35,671 --> 01:09:39,004
That's the whole point, isn't it?
That you can't see it.

1119
01:09:39,175 --> 01:09:41,905
- That's what you're buying, isn't it?
- That's true.

1120
01:10:03,699 --> 01:10:05,189
Thank you.

1121
01:10:08,337 --> 01:10:10,805
Wait a second.
Come on.

1122
01:10:12,575 --> 01:10:14,133
Is that...?

1123
01:10:15,311 --> 01:10:18,075
Please. Finally!

1124
01:10:18,914 --> 01:10:20,176
Well.

1125
01:10:20,349 --> 01:10:22,112
Now you'll believe me
when I tell you...

1126
01:10:22,284 --> 01:10:25,185
...that you've driven past it
half a dozen times.

1127
01:10:53,349 --> 01:10:56,443
It is the most incredible thing
I have ever seen.

1128
01:10:56,619 --> 01:10:59,383
Shall we conclude our business?

1129
01:11:01,190 --> 01:11:03,021
Gentlemen, to the center
of the ring.

1130
01:11:03,659 --> 01:11:06,184
I explained the instructions
in the dressing room.

1131
01:11:06,362 --> 01:11:08,023
You're both professional fighters.

1132
01:11:08,197 --> 01:11:10,688
I expect you to conduct
yourself professionally.

1133
01:11:11,200 --> 01:11:13,532
- Shake hands.
- You ready to do this?

1134
01:11:13,702 --> 01:11:14,964
Let's do it.

1135
01:11:21,410 --> 01:11:24,277
It looks like my computer
is a billion dollars healthier.

1136
01:11:24,446 --> 01:11:26,437
Which makes you the proud owner...

1137
01:11:26,615 --> 01:11:29,778
...of the most advanced piece
of weaponry on the planet.

1138
01:11:30,853 --> 01:11:32,650
Watch this.

1139
01:11:37,726 --> 01:11:39,853
The ignition code.

1140
01:11:49,204 --> 01:11:51,195
Round one
for the super middleweight...

1141
01:11:51,373 --> 01:11:53,933
...championship of the world!
- Cedric, come on.

1142
01:11:54,243 --> 01:11:56,711
Do you want the swelling
on the left or right?

1143
01:11:58,447 --> 01:12:00,881
Mills goes right to work.

1144
01:12:03,952 --> 01:12:05,544
Left hand up!
Left hand up!

1145
01:12:05,721 --> 01:12:06,881
He's spun around by...

1146
01:12:25,941 --> 01:12:26,737
What are you doing?

1147
01:12:27,176 --> 01:12:28,006
I'm working.

1148
01:12:51,367 --> 01:12:54,165
That looks like an old-fashioned
thermonuclear warhead.

1149
01:12:54,336 --> 01:12:58,272
- It's a bit primitive, isn't it?
- They won't think so in Washington.

1150
01:13:14,223 --> 01:13:16,282
Tell your men to drop their guns.

1151
01:13:16,458 --> 01:13:18,619
- Tell them!
- Do as he says.

1152
01:13:18,794 --> 01:13:20,455
Get your hands up!

1153
01:13:20,629 --> 01:13:22,688
You too, Mr. Zhu Tam.

1154
01:13:22,931 --> 01:13:24,558
Do it!

1155
01:13:29,104 --> 01:13:32,005
You didn't think you could
fool BNS, did you?

1156
01:13:34,009 --> 01:13:36,102
- Rachel?
- I guess we did.

1157
01:13:36,278 --> 01:13:39,805
- You're alive?
- Don't tell anyone.

1158
01:13:41,383 --> 01:13:44,318
Robinson having his way.
Combination to the head.

1159
01:13:44,787 --> 01:13:47,915
And a left hook jars the challenger.

1160
01:13:48,991 --> 01:13:51,653
Here comes Robinson,
and here comes Mills.

1161
01:13:51,960 --> 01:13:53,951
Body shots by the challenger, Mills.

1162
01:13:54,129 --> 01:13:57,326
Holding on to him.
Tying the champion up.

1163
01:13:59,168 --> 01:14:02,262
That was pretty convincing.
The whole "I'm dead" thing.

1164
01:14:02,438 --> 01:14:04,201
You pick up a few tricks
over the years.

1165
01:14:04,373 --> 01:14:07,604
- You certainly do.
- You really should have caught it.

1166
01:14:07,776 --> 01:14:09,334
Yeah, I should have.

1167
01:14:09,511 --> 01:14:12,844
I guess I was a little distracted
by the sound of my heart breaking.

1168
01:14:15,017 --> 01:14:17,008
Code invalid.

1169
01:14:18,387 --> 01:14:20,878
That's not good.
Is that good?

1170
01:14:21,056 --> 01:14:24,150
- What the hell did you do?
- I entered the ignition code.

1171
01:14:24,326 --> 01:14:26,658
Self-destruct sequence
activated.

1172
01:14:26,995 --> 01:14:29,657
It has a self-destruct mechanism
if the wrong code is entered.

1173
01:14:29,832 --> 01:14:34,701
No, that is the correct code. I saw
Lt. Percy fire the engine myself.

1174
01:14:34,870 --> 01:14:39,034
Just get it handled, Agent Wright.
That's what you're paid to do.

1175
01:14:42,244 --> 01:14:44,644
He ain't done nothing
to earn your respect!

1176
01:14:44,813 --> 01:14:47,247
It's number 58 going down
right now. You hear?

1177
01:14:47,416 --> 01:14:48,747
- How you feeling?
- 58.

1178
01:14:48,917 --> 01:14:50,612
- You good?
- Good, yeah.

1179
01:14:50,786 --> 01:14:52,777
Damn! She may wanna
braid that.

1180
01:14:55,190 --> 01:14:57,852
And this world championship fight
rages on.

1181
01:14:58,026 --> 01:14:59,288
The code times out?

1182
01:14:59,461 --> 01:15:03,727
What, like a safety precaution?
In case the plane were stolen?

1183
01:15:03,899 --> 01:15:07,232
You're flying the plane home.
I assume you know the correct code.

1184
01:15:07,402 --> 01:15:10,803
Assumptions have a way of coming
back and kicking you in your ass.

1185
01:15:12,808 --> 01:15:15,777
Robinson measuring Mills up.

1186
01:15:17,746 --> 01:15:20,476
A wicked left hook by Robinson.

1187
01:15:20,782 --> 01:15:23,580
- How much is he paying you?
- I don't have time for this.

1188
01:15:23,752 --> 01:15:26,220
If I'd known you were for sale,
I would have bid!

1189
01:15:28,190 --> 01:15:29,589
I know that hurt.

1190
01:15:29,758 --> 01:15:32,318
You got a hard-ass head.
Damn!

1191
01:15:32,494 --> 01:15:34,894
The code, Alex.

1192
01:15:38,133 --> 01:15:39,293
Come on, Cedric.

1193
01:15:41,136 --> 01:15:43,798
Robinson dancing around.
What's going on here?

1194
01:15:43,972 --> 01:15:46,600
It looks like he's fighting
an invisible opponent.

1195
01:15:53,448 --> 01:15:57,782
And down goes Robinson!
Unbelievable!

1196
01:15:57,953 --> 01:16:00,945
Rachel, you're not getting
this plane off the bridge.

1197
01:16:02,391 --> 01:16:04,222
Five. Six...

1198
01:16:04,393 --> 01:16:07,487
Kelly Robinson is down
for the first time in his career!

1199
01:16:07,663 --> 01:16:09,460
- Can you continue?
- I'm okay.

1200
01:16:09,631 --> 01:16:10,689
- Let's go.
- All right.

1201
01:16:10,866 --> 01:16:12,094
Let's go. Fight!

1202
01:16:15,137 --> 01:16:17,128
Now it's gonna get messy.

1203
01:16:24,046 --> 01:16:25,741
It's time to go down.

1204
01:16:29,017 --> 01:16:30,917
And Mills is down!

1205
01:16:31,086 --> 01:16:34,146
- Now we're talking!
- Five.

1206
01:16:34,323 --> 01:16:35,950
- Come on, come on!
- Six.

1207
01:16:36,124 --> 01:16:38,854
Seven. Eight. Nine.

1208
01:16:39,027 --> 01:16:41,495
- He's not gonna make it.
- Ten! You're out!

1209
01:16:41,663 --> 01:16:44,393
It's over!
Kelly Robinson is still...

1210
01:16:44,566 --> 01:16:46,864
...the super middleweight
champion of the world!

1211
01:16:50,505 --> 01:16:53,941
Robinson foregoing his usual
flamboyant victory lap.

1212
01:16:54,109 --> 01:16:56,077
He bolts the ring.

1213
01:16:56,311 --> 01:16:59,075
I'm impressed, Alex.
You're tougher than I thought.

1214
01:16:59,247 --> 01:17:02,216
There's one thing that
will always make a man talk.

1215
01:17:08,123 --> 01:17:09,590
Cutting my belt?

1216
01:17:19,501 --> 01:17:22,732
- Take off his pants.
- Take off my pants?

1217
01:17:22,904 --> 01:17:25,065
Hold it.
Wait a second.

1218
01:17:37,319 --> 01:17:39,412
Easy. Easy.
Come on, take it easy.

1219
01:17:53,769 --> 01:17:56,636
- What are you doing here?
- You turned on the eye thing...

1220
01:17:56,805 --> 01:17:59,433
...so I had to come save your ass!
- I did?

1221
01:18:01,443 --> 01:18:04,970
That's a huge gesture!
That must mean you really love me.

1222
01:18:05,147 --> 01:18:07,115
Don't get this twisted.
I did this to secure my parade!

1223
01:18:07,282 --> 01:18:10,080
- No getting around it. You love me.
- This is for the parade!

1224
01:18:10,252 --> 01:18:11,276
- It's love!
- Parade!

1225
01:18:11,453 --> 01:18:12,283
- It's love!
- Parade!

1226
01:18:12,454 --> 01:18:13,921
- Love!
- Kelly Robinson Day parade!

1227
01:18:14,089 --> 01:18:15,283
Move!

1228
01:18:19,895 --> 01:18:21,556
I'm starting to regret this shit!

1229
01:18:22,464 --> 01:18:23,954
Move! Move!

1230
01:18:28,003 --> 01:18:29,402
Cover me!
Go!

1231
01:18:52,961 --> 01:18:55,122
Hold your fire!
Hold your fire!

1232
01:18:57,132 --> 01:18:58,394
Who the hell is this guy?

1233
01:18:59,367 --> 01:19:02,302
It's Carlos. I guess Mac
sent him in as backup for us.

1234
01:19:02,471 --> 01:19:03,733
He's like a superspy.

1235
01:19:03,905 --> 01:19:06,203
He's a spy, the same as me.
Not a superspy.

1236
01:19:06,374 --> 01:19:08,865
He got a fly-ass
ninja outfit and parachute.

1237
01:19:09,044 --> 01:19:10,375
We hanging from balloons
and shit.

1238
01:19:10,846 --> 01:19:13,781
Gundars! Tell your men
to put down their weapons.

1239
01:19:13,949 --> 01:19:16,110
It seems to be quite
a trend tonight. Down!

1240
01:19:16,284 --> 01:19:19,048
Alex, the code
before we all blow up.

1241
01:19:19,221 --> 01:19:22,019
That's what I'm doing.
I was on my way to do it.

1242
01:19:22,190 --> 01:19:25,626
- Doing fine before you got here.
- Mr. Zhu Tam, I believe.

1243
01:19:25,794 --> 01:19:27,819
Carlos, careful.
Rachel's a double agent!

1244
01:19:27,996 --> 01:19:30,556
Yes, I know, Alex.

1245
01:19:31,500 --> 01:19:33,730
Yours too, Rachel.

1246
01:19:37,906 --> 01:19:41,342
Apparently, you've been a bad girl.

1247
01:19:45,580 --> 01:19:47,878
Now hold up.
Wait a second. Hey, Alex...

1248
01:19:48,049 --> 01:19:50,517
...this James Bond is with Rachel.
- Not now.

1249
01:19:50,685 --> 01:19:53,586
I got a hunch. This guy is bad.
I can feel it right now.

1250
01:19:53,755 --> 01:19:55,882
I said, not now.
Let me figure this out!

1251
01:19:56,057 --> 01:19:57,854
How did big shot know
she was bad?

1252
01:19:58,026 --> 01:20:01,154
I got 45 seconds to figure out
this logarithmic code...

1253
01:20:01,329 --> 01:20:03,695
...or we'll all die
because we'll blow up.

1254
01:20:03,865 --> 01:20:07,494
Why don't you stick to your perfume
ads and leave the espionage to me?

1255
01:20:07,669 --> 01:20:09,000
No, don't say that to him.

1256
01:20:09,171 --> 01:20:11,867
Hey, Zorro, it's not perfume.
It's cologne.

1257
01:20:12,507 --> 01:20:14,134
No, Kelly! No!

1258
01:20:26,188 --> 01:20:28,281
Come on, come on.
Here we go.

1259
01:20:28,456 --> 01:20:30,424
- Code invalid.
- Come on.

1260
01:20:30,592 --> 01:20:32,082
Eighteen, seventeen...

1261
01:20:32,727 --> 01:20:33,853
...sixteen...

1262
01:20:37,199 --> 01:20:38,791
Thirteen...

1263
01:20:38,967 --> 01:20:40,195
...twelve...

1264
01:20:40,368 --> 01:20:41,426
...eleven...

1265
01:20:44,940 --> 01:20:49,536
Nine, eight, seven.
Sequence aborted.

1266
01:20:49,711 --> 01:20:50,871
I got it. I got it.

1267
01:20:51,046 --> 01:20:53,241
No, I don't. No, I don't.
No, I don't.

1268
01:20:58,820 --> 01:21:01,880
Don't do it! Put that shit down.
Put the gun down right now.

1269
01:21:02,424 --> 01:21:05,018
Putting it down. Okay?

1270
01:21:06,094 --> 01:21:08,255
But I'm on your side.
I'm with BNS.

1271
01:21:08,430 --> 01:21:11,126
What do BNS stand for?
Bitch that Need Slapping?

1272
01:21:11,299 --> 01:21:14,325
I tried to make sure Carlos
doesn't get to this computer.

1273
01:21:14,502 --> 01:21:16,800
Think I believe that?
What's wrong with you?

1274
01:21:16,972 --> 01:21:20,567
- Hear her trying to flip the script?
- She's saying she's good?

1275
01:21:20,742 --> 01:21:23,302
I gotta hear this.
This should be rich.

1276
01:21:23,478 --> 01:21:26,106
We've suspected Carlos
was dirty for months.

1277
01:21:26,281 --> 01:21:28,977
Mac and me teamed up with him
so we could nail him.

1278
01:21:29,150 --> 01:21:31,812
- Why didn't they tell me?
- You know how this works.

1279
01:21:32,254 --> 01:21:34,814
It's all on a need-to-know basis.
You know that.

1280
01:21:34,990 --> 01:21:37,891
Mac didn't want you protecting me
at the wrong time.

1281
01:21:38,059 --> 01:21:40,994
That's all Carlos would have
needed. He's jealous of us.

1282
01:21:41,162 --> 01:21:43,027
- He is?
- Lf he knew how we felt...

1283
01:21:43,198 --> 01:21:45,530
Go easy now.
Don't be creeping up and shit.

1284
01:21:45,700 --> 01:21:48,362
She got long legs.
Bitch is sneaky. She'll kick you.

1285
01:21:48,536 --> 01:21:50,595
He's always known
I wanted to work with you.

1286
01:21:50,772 --> 01:21:52,865
- You wanted to work with me?
- Yeah.

1287
01:21:53,041 --> 01:21:54,770
What, like on a stakeout?

1288
01:21:56,278 --> 01:21:58,712
Don't you know
how I feel about you?

1289
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:02,213
- That's bullshit.
- My head's spinning. I don't know...

1290
01:22:02,384 --> 01:22:05,876
- Can't deny it. I feel the same...
- You dizzy from massive blood loss...

1291
01:22:06,054 --> 01:22:08,784
...because the bitch stabbed you
15 minutes ago!

1292
01:22:08,957 --> 01:22:11,949
I could have crippled him
for life if I wanted to.

1293
01:22:12,127 --> 01:22:16,063
- You've got full mobility in your leg?
- It doesn't feel that bad.

1294
01:22:16,231 --> 01:22:17,493
Son of a gun.

1295
01:22:18,967 --> 01:22:22,903
I had no idea.
Carlos was jealous of us?

1296
01:22:23,071 --> 01:22:25,039
Enough.
I can't listen to this shit.

1297
01:22:25,206 --> 01:22:28,073
What's wrong with you?
You booty-blinded right now.

1298
01:22:28,243 --> 01:22:31,701
It's like being snow-blinded with
no snow, just a cute piece of ass.

1299
01:22:31,880 --> 01:22:34,348
No. She's telling the truth.

1300
01:22:34,516 --> 01:22:37,212
You don't understand the spy world.
There are agents.

1301
01:22:37,385 --> 01:22:40,445
There are double agents, and
there are pseudo-double agents.

1302
01:22:40,622 --> 01:22:42,487
It's actually pretty standard stuff.

1303
01:22:42,657 --> 01:22:44,557
Y'all stabbing each other is standard?

1304
01:22:44,859 --> 01:22:47,987
Yeah. It's pretty standard.

1305
01:22:48,196 --> 01:22:49,424
Look out!

1306
01:23:01,343 --> 01:23:02,537
I'm watching your ass.

1307
01:23:04,312 --> 01:23:06,507
Alex, you idiot!
I'm on your side!

1308
01:23:06,681 --> 01:23:08,080
I've had enough of this!

1309
01:23:18,293 --> 01:23:20,591
There's Vitalis and shit all over...

1310
01:23:20,762 --> 01:23:25,222
He was coming like a buzz saw. If you
didn't grab him, he was gonna kill me.

1311
01:23:25,400 --> 01:23:28,164
It was like looking
in the eyes of the devil.

1312
01:23:28,703 --> 01:23:30,295
Where's Rachel?

1313
01:23:31,439 --> 01:23:33,907
Yeah, where is Rachel, huh?
She gone.

1314
01:23:34,075 --> 01:23:36,339
Didn't I tell you
that bitch was bad?

1315
01:23:36,511 --> 01:23:38,274
Why didn't you keep
an eye on her?

1316
01:23:38,446 --> 01:23:41,438
- You said she was good!
- You can't listen to what I say.

1317
01:23:41,616 --> 01:23:44,346
I'm bleeding from a knife wound.
I'm delusional!

1318
01:23:44,519 --> 01:23:47,386
You said yourself I'm booty-blind.
I'm blinded by ass.

1319
01:23:47,555 --> 01:23:49,284
You blinded now, but a minute ago...

1320
01:23:49,457 --> 01:23:53,052
You two fools just let Rachel
escape with Gundars' computer?

1321
01:23:53,228 --> 01:23:56,391
That has all the passwords
to his numbered accounts.

1322
01:23:56,564 --> 01:24:00,159
It's worth billions of dollars!
Mac knew you would screw this up.

1323
01:24:00,335 --> 01:24:01,734
That's why he sent me...

1324
01:24:03,571 --> 01:24:06,438
"Worth billions of dollars."
You hear this guy?

1325
01:24:06,908 --> 01:24:09,206
He's still a bad guy, right?

1326
01:24:09,844 --> 01:24:12,210
Yeah, he...
Well, I don't know.

1327
01:24:12,380 --> 01:24:15,543
Everybody keeps flip-flopping
around. I can't keep it straight.

1328
01:24:15,717 --> 01:24:17,116
It's murky.

1329
01:24:17,285 --> 01:24:19,947
- You said it was standard...
- I know what I said!

1330
01:24:20,121 --> 01:24:22,589
It's murky when there ain't
no girl involved, huh?

1331
01:24:22,757 --> 01:24:24,122
I see how it go.

1332
01:24:24,292 --> 01:24:27,159
I'll tell you one thing. Good
or bad, I'm tying this guy up.

1333
01:24:27,762 --> 01:24:30,162
We tie everybody up.
That's the new rule.

1334
01:24:30,498 --> 01:24:33,695
Why don't you stop stressing?
There's the Leafy Bug, baby.

1335
01:24:33,902 --> 01:24:36,097
That's what we set out to do,
and we got it!

1336
01:24:36,271 --> 01:24:37,966
We got the plane.
We heroes.

1337
01:24:38,139 --> 01:24:40,403
- You're right. Let's go home.
- Look at that.

1338
01:24:40,575 --> 01:24:43,567
- You wanna see something cool?
- What?

1339
01:24:48,917 --> 01:24:51,408
Man, that is some superfly,
superspy shit!

1340
01:24:51,586 --> 01:24:53,053
Let me see.
What you pressing?

1341
01:24:53,221 --> 01:24:55,382
- Just press that button.
- Okay.

1342
01:24:55,857 --> 01:24:57,154
- Invisible.
- Invisible.

1343
01:24:57,325 --> 01:25:00,453
Gotta get that on my cars. You know
how clean my garage is gonna look?

1344
01:25:00,628 --> 01:25:03,290
Visible. Invisible.
Visible...

1345
01:25:03,465 --> 01:25:06,059
- Don't wear out the battery.
- Let me have some fun.

1346
01:25:06,234 --> 01:25:10,193
- It loses its specialness. Give it back.
- Come on, why you acting...?

1347
01:25:11,039 --> 01:25:14,008
Why you gotta be tripping?
Why can't I play with it?

1348
01:25:14,175 --> 01:25:16,837
- You broke it.
- I broke the shit? How I break it?

1349
01:25:17,011 --> 01:25:19,809
Like a child, you knock it
out of my hand. I broke it?

1350
01:25:19,981 --> 01:25:21,778
You happy now?
How will I explain this?

1351
01:25:21,950 --> 01:25:24,885
I show up with the plane
and a broken remote.

1352
01:25:25,053 --> 01:25:26,680
You think they're worried
about the remote?

1353
01:25:26,855 --> 01:25:29,881
There's dead bodies all over the roof.
You think they'll care about that?

1354
01:25:30,058 --> 01:25:32,049
- Come on, man!
- You're right. Let's go.

1355
01:25:32,227 --> 01:25:34,525
- We're heroes.
- I'm gonna get my parade, huh?

1356
01:25:34,696 --> 01:25:37,824
- Maybe so.
- I'll definitely get a parade behind this.

1357
01:25:39,868 --> 01:25:43,304
All right. Settle back,
and I'm gonna fire this baby up.

1358
01:25:44,506 --> 01:25:47,270
And that is why they call it
the Switchblade.

1359
01:25:54,782 --> 01:25:57,046
All right. Ready
for the ride of your life?

1360
01:25:57,218 --> 01:25:58,708
Yeah, let's do this.

1361
01:26:01,990 --> 01:26:03,048
Watch this.

1362
01:26:04,159 --> 01:26:05,524
Punch it!

1363
01:26:10,365 --> 01:26:12,890
Got a little wrinkle.
Not to worry.

1364
01:26:21,109 --> 01:26:23,703
Kelly Robinson ain't supposed
to go out like this!

1365
01:26:23,878 --> 01:26:26,472
I'm supposed to die in the ring!

1366
01:26:31,052 --> 01:26:33,919
Kelly, you okay?
Come here. You okay?

1367
01:26:34,088 --> 01:26:36,113
Hell, no! I ain't okay.

1368
01:26:36,291 --> 01:26:38,782
You just crashed my parade
down into the river.

1369
01:26:38,960 --> 01:26:42,452
We had nozzle failure. Then the
thrust manifold went all haywire.

1370
01:26:42,630 --> 01:26:45,565
You didn't check it, did you?
Huh? This is perfect!

1371
01:26:45,733 --> 01:26:49,533
My first mission, I do everything right.
Now thanks to you, I ain't a hero!

1372
01:26:49,704 --> 01:26:52,172
- What is that?
- This is my flotation device.

1373
01:26:52,340 --> 01:26:53,568
- That's a bomb!
- What?

1374
01:26:53,741 --> 01:26:55,299
That's a thermonuclear bomb.

1375
01:26:55,476 --> 01:26:57,808
Why you gotta throw them
around here, then?

1376
01:26:57,979 --> 01:27:01,847
No, it's okay. It's not armed.
Can you imagine if this had gone off?

1377
01:27:02,016 --> 01:27:04,041
This would have killed millions!

1378
01:27:04,219 --> 01:27:07,450
- And they didn't arm it?
- They didn't get a chance to.

1379
01:27:07,622 --> 01:27:09,920
You know why
they didn't get a chance to?

1380
01:27:10,091 --> 01:27:11,456
Because we stopped them!

1381
01:27:11,626 --> 01:27:13,526
We stopped them.
Know what that means?

1382
01:27:13,695 --> 01:27:16,095
- I think so.
- We heroes again!

1383
01:27:16,264 --> 01:27:18,755
- Damn, you're right.
- Bet your pink ass I'm right!

1384
01:27:18,933 --> 01:27:21,333
We're heroes again!
Even without the plane.

1385
01:27:21,502 --> 01:27:23,834
- We're heroes!
- This is the proof right here!

1386
01:27:24,005 --> 01:27:26,565
- This bomb.
- I can't wait to call the president.

1387
01:27:26,741 --> 01:27:29,869
We gonna get the Congressional
Medal of Honor and a parade!

1388
01:27:30,044 --> 01:27:31,238
This will be fantastic.

1389
01:27:41,623 --> 01:27:43,454
Has my bank transfer come through?

1390
01:27:43,625 --> 01:27:45,559
Not yet, Ms. Tessio.

1391
01:28:12,687 --> 01:28:15,155
Where you going?
You forgot your drink.

1392
01:28:15,323 --> 01:28:17,018
Alex, how are you?

1393
01:28:17,392 --> 01:28:19,485
- God!
- Came prepared this time.

1394
01:28:19,661 --> 01:28:20,719
Smart.

1395
01:28:20,895 --> 01:28:22,192
Where you going?
Back up.

1396
01:28:22,363 --> 01:28:24,092
You thought
you was gonna get away?

1397
01:28:24,265 --> 01:28:26,495
Thought you was gonna
make a fool out of Kelly Robinson?

1398
01:28:26,668 --> 01:28:29,967
When I have my parade, I'll tie
your ass to the front of a float.

1399
01:28:30,338 --> 01:28:32,272
Alex?

1400
01:28:33,007 --> 01:28:36,465
How about a stakeout
in Greece for two weeks?

1401
01:28:36,644 --> 01:28:38,271
- Stakeout?
- Yeah.

1402
01:28:39,080 --> 01:28:40,513
Two weeks?

1403
01:28:42,817 --> 01:28:44,580
Hey! The answer is still no.

1404
01:28:44,752 --> 01:28:48,085
I know. I was just imagining
for a second. There's no harm in...

1405
01:28:48,256 --> 01:28:51,623
You taking a long time. Tell her no.
You getting lost in this. No!

1406
01:28:51,793 --> 01:28:53,260
- No.
- In fact, say, "Hell, no!"

1407
01:28:53,428 --> 01:28:56,226
- Hell, no.
- Hell, no, bitch!

1408
01:28:56,564 --> 01:28:59,158
Sorry.
The spell wore off.

1409
01:29:01,035 --> 01:29:04,436
Well, boys, I'm glad you guys
got all the news coverage.

1410
01:29:04,605 --> 01:29:07,301
- What's that mean?
- Always got to have the last word.

1411
01:29:07,475 --> 01:29:09,602
She always gotta say some shit, huh?

1412
01:29:09,877 --> 01:29:13,176
What she talking about, news
coverage? Ain't been no news...

1413
01:29:13,348 --> 01:29:14,610
Is that Carlos?

1414
01:29:16,384 --> 01:29:18,648
- "Superspy hero thwarts..."
- Carlos was good.

1415
01:29:18,820 --> 01:29:21,618
- We the ones that saved the day!
- Is this a parade?

1416
01:29:21,789 --> 01:29:24,383
Yes! Look at the spectacle
and the glitter and shit!

1417
01:29:24,559 --> 01:29:26,254
That's my parade!
He stole my parade!

1418
01:29:26,427 --> 01:29:28,452
- I don't know what to say.
- I know what to say. Bullshit!

1419
01:29:28,629 --> 01:29:30,221
Bullshit!

1420
01:29:32,734 --> 01:29:33,928
Bullshit!

1421
01:29:34,102 --> 01:29:36,366
We gotta go to Washington
and get debriefed.

1422
01:29:36,537 --> 01:29:38,437
- I ain't going!
- I don't blame you.

1423
01:29:38,606 --> 01:29:42,440
It's just, I was looking forward
to testing out the hover gel with you.

1424
01:29:44,846 --> 01:29:46,609
- The whatsit gel?
- Hover.

1425
01:29:46,781 --> 01:29:49,409
It's a gelatinous hydrogen diphyoxide.

1426
01:29:49,584 --> 01:29:52,644
It's 12 times lighter than air.
You smear it all over your body...

1427
01:29:52,820 --> 01:29:54,651
...and if you're in an
oxygen-rich environment...

1428
01:29:54,822 --> 01:29:57,586
...it allows you to float
down to earth like a bird.

1429
01:29:59,761 --> 01:30:01,558
Like a jelly bird?

1430
01:30:01,729 --> 01:30:05,597
Yeah. That's the street name for it.
"Jelly Bird." Exactly.

1431
01:30:05,767 --> 01:30:07,997
They have a couple
on the transport plane.

1432
01:30:08,169 --> 01:30:11,935
Plan was, they drop us off over D.C.,
and we float down like birds.

1433
01:30:12,106 --> 01:30:16,042
There's press and photographers.
It's gonna be a whole spectacle, but...

1434
01:30:16,210 --> 01:30:18,007
What we waiting on?
Let's do this.

1435
01:30:18,179 --> 01:30:20,170
- You'll do it?
- Hell, yeah, I'll do it!

1436
01:30:20,348 --> 01:30:22,748
Float like a jelly bird?
Let's go right now.

1437
01:30:22,917 --> 01:30:25,147
I used to always dream
I'd be able to fly.

1438
01:30:25,319 --> 01:30:27,514
- You serious?
- My grandma said I was a fool.

1439
01:30:27,688 --> 01:30:29,280
That's what made her
punch me the first time!

1440
01:30:29,457 --> 01:30:31,448
- See, I told her and...
- Hold on.

1441
01:30:31,626 --> 01:30:34,322
Get some jelly on the plane
and two parachutes.

1442
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:45,000
