1
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,438
Locutus.

2
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:35,350
I am Locutus of Borg.
Resistance is futile.

3
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:16,717
Authorisation: Picard 47-AT.

4
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:20,993
- Did I catch you at a bad time?
- No, Admiral, of course not.

5
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:27,116
Ive just heard that our colony on
Ivor Prime has been destroyed.

6
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:30,630
- Long-range sensors...
- Yes, I know. The Borg.

7
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:38,559
Captain’s log: Stardate 50893.5.

8
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:43,038
The moment have dreaded for
nearly six years has finally arrived.

9
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:48,917
The Borg, our lethal enemy, have
begun an invasion of the Federation.

10
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,590
This time
there maybe no stopping them.

11
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,236
- How many ships?
- One, on a direct course for Earth.

12
00:04:56,480 --> 00:05:01,315
They’ll be in Federation space soon.
Admiral Hayes is mobilising a fleet.

13
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:05,308
- It will take us three hours...
- We’re not going.

14
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:09,798
- What do you mean?
- We’re to patrol the Neutral Zone.

15
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,949
In case the Romulans decide
to take advantage of the situation.

16
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:21,599
There has been no unusual activity
along the Romulan border.

17
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:25,998
Does Starfleet feel
we need more shakedown time?

18
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:31,797
Were ready! The Enterprise E is
the most advanced ship in the fleet.

19
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,551
I have gone over all this
with Starfleet. Their orders stand.

20
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:44,469
Number One,
set a course for the Neutral Zone.

21
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:20,394
- Bizet?
- Berlioz. What do you have?

22
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:24,479
Weve finished
our first sweep of the Neutral Zone.

23
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:28,958
Fascinating.
20 particles of dust per cubic metre.

24
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:33,358
52 ultraviolet radiation spikes
and a class-two comet.

25
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:37,348
This is certainly
worthy of our attention.

26
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:41,235
Captain, why are we out here?

27
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:45,558
Starfleet has every confidence
in the Enterprise and her crew.

28
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:49,309
Theyre just not sure
about her captain.

29
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:53,513
A man once captured
and assimilated by the Borg -

30
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:58,111
- should not be put in a situation
where he would face them again.

31
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:03,440
It would introduce an unstable element
to a critical situation.

32
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:08,475
Your experience makes you
the perfect man to lead this fight.

33
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,831
Bridge to Captain Picard.

34
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:18,192
Weve received word from the fleet,
theyvve engaged the Borg.

35
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:26,075
Mr Data, put Starfleet frequency 1486
on audio.

36
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:31,514
Flagship Endeavour,
stand by to engage.

37
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:35,395
Defiant and Bozeman,
fallback to mobile position one.

38
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:41,675
We have it in visual range.
A Borg cube on course 0215...

39
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:46,431
We are the Borg. Lower your shields
and surrender your ships.

40
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:51,316
We will add your biological
distinctiveness to our own.

41
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:56,196
Your culture will adapt to serve us.
Resistance is futile.

42
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:00,198
All units, open fire.

43
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,870
Theyve broken through
the defence perimeter.

44
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:09,596
Continue to attack.

45
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:13,076
We need reinforcements.

46
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:18,195
96 dead and 22 wounded
on the Lexington.

47
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:25,112
Lt Hawk, set a course for Earth.
Maximum warp.

48
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:30,518
I am about to disobey our orders.

49
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,952
Any of you who wish to object
should do so now.

50
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:43,595
I believe I speak for everyone here
when I say...

51
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:48,471
...to hell with our orders.

52
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,472
Red alert. All hands to battle stations.
Engage.

53
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:36,075
- Report!
- Power off-line, our weapons are gone.

54
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:44,274
Perhaps today is a good day to die.
Prepare for ramming speed.

55
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,870
Sir, theres another ship coming in.

56
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,868
Its the Enterprise.

57
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:03,792
- The Defiant is losing life support.
- Beam the survivors aboard.

58
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,037
Theyve destroyed the admiralss ship.

59
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:12,360
- What is the status of the Borg cube?
- The outer hull has been damaged.

60
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:16,030
I am reading fluctuations
in their power grid.

61
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:29,154
Number One,
open a channel to the fleet.

62
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:33,717
This is Capt Picard.
Im taking command of the fleet.

63
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:38,118
Plot in the following coordinates.
Fire on my command.

64
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:43,110
- Is that a vital system?
- Trust me, Data.

65
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:47,950
The fleet has responded, sir,
theyre standing by.

66
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,478
Fire.

67
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,755
- Mr Hawk, pursuit course. Engage.
- Aye, sir.

68
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:39,797
- What?
- I can hear them.

69
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:45,432
I have a patient here
who insists on coming to the bridge.

70
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:49,758
- Welcome aboard, Mr Worf.
- Thank you, sir.

71
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:53,316
- The Defiant?
- Adrift, but salvageable.

72
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:56,830
- Tough little ship.
- Little?

73
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:00,999
Mr Worf, we could use some help
at tactical.

74
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:07,233
You do remember
how to fire phasers?

75
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:17,276
Were detecting
chronometric particles.

76
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:20,631
- Theyre creating a temporal vortex.
- Time travel.

77
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:33,948
- Data, report.
- Were caught in a temporal wake.

78
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:37,197
Captain... Earth.

79
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,357
There are high concentrations
of methane and carbon monoxide.

80
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:49,270
- Life signs?
- Approximately nine billion.

81
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:52,233
- All Borg.
- How?.

82
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:57,389
They did it in the past. They went back
and assimilated Earth, changed history.

83
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,319
Why are we still here?

84
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:05,640
The temporal wake protected us
from changes in the time line.

85
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:10,350
- The vortex is collapsing.
- Hold your course.

86
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:14,439
We must follow them back
and repair the damage theyve done.

87
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:48,119
- Come on.
- Good night, Eddie.

88
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,914
Go home.

89
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,873
Youll regret this tomorrow.

90
00:13:54,080 --> 00:14:00,030
You should have learned by now
that I dont have regrets.

91
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,755
- One more round, Lily.
- Z, youve had enough.

92
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:09,239
- Im not flying with a drunken pilot.
- I cantt fly sober.

93
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:13,638
What is that?

94
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:19,039
- That is the constellation Leo.
- No, that!

95
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:31,514
- Its the ECON.
- After all these years?

96
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:40,156
Weve got to get to the Phoenix.

97
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:47,510
To hell with the Phoenix.

98
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:10,829
Shields are down.
Main power is holding.

99
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,669
We are in the mid 21st century.

100
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:20,432
I would estimate we have arrived
ten years after the Third World War.

101
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:24,918
That makes sense. Most of the
major cities have been destroyed.

102
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:29,352
- 600 million dead. No resistance.
- Captain.

103
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:36,074
Mr Worf, quantum torpedoes.
Fire.

104
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:52,271
They were firing at the surface.
Location?

105
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,836
Western hemisphere.
North American Continent.

106
00:15:56,040 --> 00:16:01,876
- A missile complex in Montana.
- A missile complex?.

107
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:05,516
Data, I need to know the exact date.

108
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:08,678
April 4th, 2063.

109
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:12,509
April 4th.
The day before First Contact.

110
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:17,111
The missile complex must be
where Cochrane is building his ship.

111
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,880
They came to stop First Contact.

112
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:23,755
- How much damage, Lieutenant?
- I cant tell.

113
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:27,839
Well have to go down there
and find out what happened.

114
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:30,634
Have a security team ready.

115
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:34,310
Computer, 21st century clothing.

116
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,351
Number One, you have the Bridge.

117
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:49,273
Over here.

118
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:14,191
Theyre all dead.

119
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,519
See if one of them is Cochrane.
Data, lets go check the warp ship.

120
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:47,279
The structural integrity of the missile
appears to be intact.

121
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:50,472
The fuselage is slightly damaged.

122
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:56,471
We have the blueprints.
We need a team down here.

123
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:01,758
- Hold your fire. Were here to help.
- Bullshit!

124
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:08,235
Captain, I believe I can handle this.

125
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,756
Greetings.

126
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:42,556
This woman
requires medical attention.

127
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:52,510
- Severe radiation poisoning.
- From the damaged ship.

128
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:56,838
I have to get her to sick bay.

129
00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:00,828
No lectures on the prime directive,
Ill keep her unconscious.

130
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:05,113
Tell Riker to beam down with
a search party to find Cochrane.

131
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:09,950
Crusher to Enterprise.
Two to beam directly to sick bay.

132
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:18,113
In 48 hours
this ship has to be launched.

133
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:23,758
Geordi, the ship was damaged in the
attack. Get a repair crew down here.

134
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:30,069
Im on my way. Alpha team,
werre heading down to the surface.

135
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:33,113
Porter, take command while Im gone.

136
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:38,599
Check out the environmental controls.
Its a little warm in here.

137
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:59,952
Isnt it amazing?

138
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:04,676
This ship
used to be a nuclear missile.

139
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:08,919
An historical irony. Using an
instrument of mass destruction -

140
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:12,476
- to inaugurate an era of peace.

141
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:27,717
A boyhood fantasy. Ive seen
this ship in the Smithsonian, -

142
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:30,957
- but I was never able to touch it.

143
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:35,995
Does tactile contact
alter your perception of the Phoenix?.

144
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:41,752
For humans, touch can connect you
to an object in a very personal way.

145
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:45,191
It makes it seem more real.

146
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:54,636
Im detecting imperfections
in the titanium casing.

147
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:58,469
Temperature variations
in the fuel manifold.

148
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:02,434
It is no more real to me now
than it was a moment ago.

149
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:07,156
- Would you three like to be alone?
- What have you found out?

150
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:11,592
- Theres no sign of Cochrane.
- He has to be here.

151
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:15,918
This ship and this flight
were his dream.

152
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:20,716
We should consider the possibility
that Dr Cochrane died in the attack.

153
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:27,592
If thats true...
then the future may die with him.

154
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:39,552
- What do you think?.
- The entire system has gone crazy.

155
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:44,834
Its affecting the entire deck.
Illl check the EPS conduits.

156
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:57,352
- Hello? Hey!
- Are you talking to me?

157
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:01,158
Is anyone else working up here?

158
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:04,591
Not that I know of.

159
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:16,030
Paul?

160
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:23,478
Paul, are you okay in there?

161
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:42,232
Captain, what is it?

162
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:49,078
Picard to Enterprise. Mr Worf,
is everything all right up there?

163
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:54,195
We are experiencing some
environmental diffiiculties.

164
00:22:54,400 --> 00:23:00,191
Humidityhas risen 73%
and the temperature is up 10 degrees.

165
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:06,077
Mr Data and I will be right there.
Number One, take charge down here.

166
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:12,230
The damage to her cell membranes
is repaired. She should be fine.

167
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:15,637
Find out why its so hot in here.

168
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:19,469
- Now what?
- Crusher to Engineering.

169
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,919
Crusher to Bridge.

170
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:28,433
- Exactly whats been happening?
- Wevve lost contact with Deck 16.

171
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:32,838
I was about to send
a security team to investigate.

172
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:37,272
No, seal off Deck 16. Post
security teams at every access point.

173
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:41,712
What environmental conditions
were last reported in Engineering?

174
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:46,789
92% humidity.
39.1 degrees Celsius.

175
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:51,835
39.1 degrees Celsius...
like a Borg ship.

176
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:55,999
They knew their ship was doomed.
Our shields were down.

177
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:59,988
Somehow they transported over here
without being detected.

178
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:04,876
Theyll assimilate the Enterprise...
and then Earth.

179
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,792
Picard to Riker.

180
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:14,470
Enterprise to Away Team.

181
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,239
Respond.

182
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:23,673
Main control is being re-routed
through Engineering.

183
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:27,236
Data, lock out the main computer.

184
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:39,711
I have isolated the main computer
with an encryption code.

185
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:43,959
The Borg have cut primary power
to all decks except 16.

186
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:46,355
The Borg wont stay on Deck 16.

187
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,879
Youre all right. Come on, wake up.

188
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:57,357
You are all right. Listen to me.

189
00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:01,030
Youre going to be fine.
I need you to do as I say.

190
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:05,677
- Is the EMH programme on-line?
- It should be.

191
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:11,876
- Activate the EMH programme.
- What is the nature of the emergency?.

192
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:16,756
20 Borg are about to break in here.
Create a diversion.

193
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:20,396
This isnt part of my programme.
Imm a doctor.

194
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:24,673
Do a dance, tell a story,
just give us a few seconds.

195
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:37,388
According to medical research, Borg
implants can cause skin irritations.

196
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:41,798
Perhaps youd like
an analgesic cream.

197
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:48,155
Which way?.

198
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:51,875
We need to get off this deck.
Follow me.

199
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:10,112
Engineering will be the central point
from which they control the hive.

200
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:15,713
If we begin firing in there,
we may hit the warp core.

201
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:23,957
Our goal should be to puncture
one of the plasma coolant tanks.

202
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:29,632
Plasma coolant will liquefy
organic material on contact.

203
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:34,755
The Borg cannot survive
without their organic components.

204
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:38,669
All weapons will be set
on a rotating modulation.

205
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:42,839
The Borg will adapt quickly.
Well be able to fire 12 shots at most.

206
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:49,798
You may encounter crew members
who have already been assimilated.

207
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:57,076
Dont hesitate to fire. Believe me,
youlll be doing them a favour. Let`sss go.

208
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,870
Deanna!

209
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:33,317
Deanna!

210
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:38,429
Will, dont turn off that..!

211
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:44,988
Who is this jerk?. And who told him
he could turn off my music?

212
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:49,830
Will Riker, Zefram Cochrane.

213
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:55,358
- Is he a friend of yours?
- Yes.

214
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:57,755
- Husband?
- No?

215
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:00,269
Good.

216
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:04,238
- This, Deena...
- Deanna.

217
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:09,230
This... is the good stuff.

218
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:12,432
Dr Cochrane...

219
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:16,758
To the Phoenix...
May she rest in peace.

220
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,997
Okay, that wasnt so good.

221
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:34,998
- We have to tell him the truth.
- Then the time line...

222
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:40,115
This is no time to argue about time.
We dont have the time.

223
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:49,192
- What was I saying?
- Youre drunk.

224
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:54,315
He wouldnt even talk to me
unless I had a drink with him.

225
00:28:54,520 --> 00:29:00,470
It took three shots of tequila
just to find out his name.

226
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:05,071
Ive spent the last 20 minutes
trying to keep his hands off me.

227
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:09,432
So dont go criticising
my counselling techniques.

228
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,788
Its a primitive culture.

229
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:22,758
Im just trying to blend in.
He didntt believe our cover story.

230
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:27,909
Were running out of time.
Will he be able to handle the truth?

231
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:37,073
If youre looking for my
professional opinion... Hess nuts.

232
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:40,317
Ill be sure to note that in my log.

233
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:09,434
Captain, I believe Im feeling...
anxiety.

234
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:12,677
It is an intriguing sensation.

235
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:18,796
Data, perhaps you should deactivate
your emotion chip for now.

236
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:23,790
Good idea, sir... Done.

237
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,549
Data, there are times that I envy you.

238
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:43,869
Its only me! We have wounded here.

239
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:50,474
- Get these people back to Deck 14.
- There was a civilian with us.

240
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:55,310
- Well watch for her.
- Please, try to find her.

241
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:21,434
Lower your weapons. Theyll ignore
us till the consider us a threat.

242
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,589
The manual release.

243
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:10,197
Mr Worf, hold this position.

244
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:18,797
Manualrelease on-line.

245
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:28,590
Perhaps we should just knock.

246
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:32,749
Data.

247
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:46,274
Ready phasers.

248
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:59,996
Data, cover me.

249
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:10,633
Captain, they have adapted.

250
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:50,712
Regroup on Deck 15.
Dont let them touch you.

251
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:56,196
- Captain!
- Data!

252
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:16,879
Here!

253
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:23,437
Help!

254
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:26,552
Please, help.

255
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:49,437
- You! How the hell..?
- Back off!

256
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:54,555
Who are you?
What faction are you with?

257
00:35:54,760 --> 00:36:00,073
- Im not with the Eastern Coalition.
- Just get me the hell out of here.

258
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:03,955
- Now!
- That isnt going to be easy.

259
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:08,790
Youd better find a way,
or Imm going to start pushing buttons.

260
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:14,836
- Follow me.
- Slow!

261
00:36:56,360 --> 00:37:00,114
You wont be able to break
the encryption codes.

262
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:03,676
Nor will you
be able to assimilate me.

263
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:06,997
Brave words.
Ive heard them before.

264
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:12,752
From thousands ofspecies
across thousands ofworlds.

265
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:15,952
Butnow they are alIBorg.

266
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:23,271
I am unlike any life form
you have encountered before.

267
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:27,314
You are an imperfectbeing,
created by an imperfectbeing.

268
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:32,594
Findingyour weakness
is only a matter oftime.

269
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:43,748
Let me make sure I understand you
correctly, Commander.

270
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:48,795
A group of cybernetic creatures
from the future -

271
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:53,039
- have travelled back through time
to enslave the human race.

272
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:58,917
And youre here to stop them?
Hot damn! Yourre heroic.

273
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:06,635
- Were going to prove it to you.
- There she is! Beautiful!

274
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:11,916
- All right, take a look.
- Well, well, well...

275
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:16,432
What have we got here?
I love a good peep show.

276
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:33,392
Thats a trick.
How did you do that?

277
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:37,798
- Its your telescope.
- Thatss our ship. The Enterprise.

278
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:49,870
And Lily is up there?
Can I talk to her?.

279
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:54,198
Weve lost contact with the ship.
We dontt know why yet.

280
00:38:54,400 --> 00:39:00,350
- So what is it you want me to do?
- Conduct your flight as planned.

281
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:03,597
Why tomorrow morning?

282
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:11,271
At 11 oclock an alien ship
will be passing this solar system.

283
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:15,189
Alien? You mean extra-terrestrials?

284
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:18,710
- More bad guys?
- Good guys.

285
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:22,117
They have no interest in Earth...
too primitive.

286
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:31,591
When they discover that humans have
learned how to fly faster than light, -

287
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:36,032
- they alter their course and make
first contact with Earth right here.

288
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,834
- Here?
- Actually, over there.

289
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:44,239
Its a pivotal moment in human history.
You make contact with an alien race.

290
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:47,750
After you do,
everything begins to change.

291
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:53,353
Fleets of starships are built
and mankind explores the galaxy.

292
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:59,795
It unites humanity when they realise
theyre not alone in the universe.

293
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,118
Poverty, disease and war
will all be gone in 50 years.

294
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:09,838
But unless you make that warp flight
tomorrow, none of it will happen.

295
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:13,919
You people are all astronauts...

296
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:16,998
...on some kind of star trek.

297
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:21,352
I know this is a lot to take in,
but were running out of time.

298
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:26,429
- We need your help.
- What do you say?.

299
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:40,029
Why not?

300
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:41,471
It looks pretty bad, sir.
They control decks 26 up to 11.

301
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:45,753
When they took Deck 11,
they stopped.

302
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:50,431
Theyve assimilated half the ship.
Why stop there?

303
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:55,509
- What is on Deck 11?
- Hydroponics. Deflector control.

304
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:59,838
They stopped there because
it gave them a tactical advantage.

305
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:01,439
Return to your checkpoints.

306
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:06,713
What happened in sick bay?.
Wheres Dr Crusher?.

307
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:10,435
- Why did you break the cease-fire?
- We didnt attack you.

308
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:19,635
Theres a new faction that
wants to prevent tomorrowss launch.

309
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:25,312
Were here to help you.
You are not in Montana anymore.

310
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:30,469
You are on a spaceship
orbiting the Earth.

311
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:35,231
- Get me out of here.
- All right.

312
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:39,918
You want a way out. Here it is.

313
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:45,472
What is this?

314
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:52,153
Australia. New Guinea.
The Solomons.

315
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:57,878
Montana will be up soon,
but its a long way down.

316
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:02,198
Im not your enemy
and I can get you home.

317
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:06,109
Put the weapon down and trust me.

318
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:16,916
Jean-Luc Picard.
Thats my name, whatss yours?

319
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:23,549
- Lily.
- Welcome aboard, Lily.

320
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:32,754
Thank you.

321
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:38,518
Maximum setting. If youd fired this,
youdd have vaporised me.

322
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:43,391
Its my first ray gun.

323
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:05,832
- Theres no glass.
- Forcefield.

324
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:12,593
- Ive never seen such technology.
- It hasntt been invented yet.

325
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:17,074
Theres more I have to tell you.
Come on.

326
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:25,558
Are you ready?

327
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:28,752
- Who are you?
- I am the Borg.

328
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:33,351
That is a contradiction. The Borg
have a collective consciousness.

329
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:36,552
There are no individuals.

330
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:48,075
I am the beginning, the end,
the one who is many.

331
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:04,512
I am the Borg.

332
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:08,353
Greetings.

333
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:12,030
I am curious,
do you control the Borg collective?

334
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:16,597
You imply disparity where
none exists. I am the collective.

335
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:21,999
Ill rephrase the question.
I wish to understand their hierarchy.

336
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:25,158
Are you their leader?.

337
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:29,994
I bring order to chaos.

338
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:33,272
A cryptic response.

339
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:36,313
You are in chaos, Data.

340
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:40,149
You are a machine
who wishes to be human.

341
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:46,754
I am programmed
to evolve and to better myself.

342
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:50,111
We, too, are on a quest
to better ourselves.

343
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:53,118
Evolving toward a state of perfection.

344
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:57,791
Forgive me, but the Borg
do not evolve, they conquer.

345
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:05,270
By assimilating other beings we are
bringing them closer to perfection.

346
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:09,632
Somehow I question your motives.

347
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:16,393
That is because you havent
been properly... stimulated yet.

348
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:27,390
You have reactivated
my emotion chip. Why?.

349
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:32,958
- Dont be frightened.
- I am not frightened.

350
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:45,712
- Do you know what this is?
- It would appear to be organic skin.

351
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:51,552
What a cold description
for such a beautiful gift.

352
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:09,036
Was that good for you?

353
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:18,508
- How big is this Federation?
- Over 150 planets.

354
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:22,713
- They span 8,000 light years.
- You mustnt get home much.

355
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:28,358
I tend to think of this ship as home.
I get back to Earth whenever I can.

356
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:35,155
- They havent broken the code yet.
- Who? The zombies?

357
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:39,239
- The Borg.
- It sounds Swedish.

358
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:51,436
- How big is this ship?
- 24 decks. 700 metres long.

359
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:58,637
It took me six months to find enough
titanium just to build a cockpit.

360
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:05,357
How much did this thing cost?

361
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:09,439
The economics of the future
are somewhat different.

362
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:13,918
Money doesnt exist
in the 24th century.

363
00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:17,510
No money?.
You mean you dont get paid?

364
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:22,840
The acquisition of wealth is no
longer the driving force in our lives.

365
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:26,157
We work to better ourselves...

366
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:29,397
...and the rest of humanity.

367
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:36,111
Actually, were rather like
yourself and Dr Cochrane.

368
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:40,512
All right!

369
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:45,032
- Come on.
- Is there another way around?

370
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:49,710
I know what Im doing.

371
00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:00,397
Definitely not Swedish.

372
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:33,318
What the hell are you doing?

373
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:47,039
Perhaps something in satin.

374
00:49:55,120 --> 00:50:00,638
Im sorry, but werre closing,
and we have a strict dress code.

375
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:04,310
If you boys dont leave...

376
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:11,190
- Im looking for Nicky the Nose.
- He hasntt been here in months.

377
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:17,673
This is the wrong chapter.

378
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:22,554
Computer, begin chapter 13.

379
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:29,989
Try and look
as if youre having a good time.

380
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:45,470
No, look at me.
Try to act naturally.

381
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:53,313
There he is.

382
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:07,517
- Ruby, this is not a good time.
- Its never the time for us, Dix.

383
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:11,998
- Is that a case youre working on?
- Illl see you later.

384
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:16,637
Okay, but watch your caboose
and dump the broad.

385
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:27,196
Look what the cat dragged in.
Whats shakin... Dix?.

386
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:30,597
The usual, martinis and skirts.
Excuse me.

387
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:37,753
- Im going to take that personal.
- No offence.

388
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:40,474
Hey!

389
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:08,357
I think you got him.

390
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:16,118
I dont get it. I thought
you said this was a hologram.

391
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:22,236
I disengaged the safety protocols,
so even a holographic bullet can kill.

392
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:27,275
- What are you doing?
- Looking for the neural processor.

393
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:30,677
Its like a memory chip.

394
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:35,954
It will contain a record of all the
instructions this Borg has received.

395
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:43,157
- Its one of your uniforms.
- Yes, this was Ensign Lynch.

396
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:47,349
Tough luck, huh?

397
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:52,757
Ive got to get to the bridge.

398
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:22,118
- Doctor...
- Yeah?

399
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:27,553
- Would you take a look at this?
- Yeah.

400
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:34,791
Ive constructed the intermix chamber
from what I remember in school.

401
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:38,595
- You learned about this in school?
- Yeah.

402
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:45,319
BBasic Warp Design````` is required
reading. You`rrre the first chapter.

403
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:50,871
Well, it looks like you got it right.

404
00:53:51,080 --> 00:53:56,996
This is what were using to replace
the damaged plasma conduit.

405
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:10,149
Yes, but you need to reinforce
the tubing with a nano-polymer.

406
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:15,309
Dr Cochrane, I know this sounds
silly, but can I shake your hand?

407
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:21,475
Its such an honour to work with you.

408
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:25,878
I never imagined Id meet
the man who invented warp drive.

409
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:29,311
Im sorry... Thanks.

410
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:42,436
- Do they have to keep doing that?
- Its just a little hero worship.

411
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:47,111
I cant say I blame them.
We all grew up hearing about you.
