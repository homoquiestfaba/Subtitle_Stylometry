1
00:00:06,139 --> 00:00:09,131
<i>In Hazzard County
folks like to tell stories.</i>

2
00:00:09,442 --> 00:00:11,774
<i>Most are made up or embellished.</i>

3
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:16,305
<i>Like the time I told everybody in town
that I wrestled three gators at once</i>

4
00:00:16,383 --> 00:00:19,910
<i>when really it was just two slow kids
and a basset hound.</i>

5
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:23,050
<i>These legends become a part of us.</i>

6
00:00:23,123 --> 00:00:26,149
<i>They show who we are
and who we'd like to be.</i>

7
00:00:26,593 --> 00:00:30,029
<i>Now, I know you've heard of few
about Hazzard's most infamous residents.</i>

8
00:00:30,096 --> 00:00:32,758
<i>But this one, the smallest child in Hazzard</i>

9
00:00:32,832 --> 00:00:35,926
<i>can rattle it off
as fast as he can hot-wire a Chevy.</i>

10
00:00:36,469 --> 00:00:38,460
<i>This here's how it all started.</i>

11
00:00:38,938 --> 00:00:42,772
<i>This is how Bo and Luke
became the Dukes of Hazzard.</i>

12
00:00:49,916 --> 00:00:53,909
<i>Bo Duke. Your average 16-year-old
itching to get his license.</i>

13
00:00:54,354 --> 00:00:56,914
Shopping cart! Shopping cart!
Shopping cart!

14
00:00:58,825 --> 00:01:01,293
<i>Maybe the seventh time will be the charm.</i>

15
00:01:04,464 --> 00:01:08,332
<i>Calling all units. In pursuit of
a male teenager driving a station wagon,</i>

16
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:10,733
<i>possible hostage situation.</i>

17
00:01:10,804 --> 00:01:13,967
<i>Yeah, Bo Duke.
He's trying to get his license again, huh?</i>

18
00:01:14,107 --> 00:01:16,132
<i>Yeah. He'll be stringed off.</i>

19
00:01:16,209 --> 00:01:17,198
<i>As is.</i>

20
00:01:25,885 --> 00:01:28,217
Excuse me. Pardon me. Coming through.

21
00:01:28,288 --> 00:01:32,554
Sorry about that. Kind of hard
to concentrate with all that screaming.

22
00:01:32,826 --> 00:01:37,024
<i>In case you can't already tell,
Bo knows one speed. Fast.</i>

23
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:40,032
<i>He's 99% instinct and 1% brains.</i>

24
00:01:40,133 --> 00:01:41,430
<i>And that's on a good day.</i>

25
00:01:41,501 --> 00:01:43,128
- I can jump it.
- No, no, no.

26
00:01:43,203 --> 00:01:45,171
- No.
- Oh, shit!

27
00:01:52,712 --> 00:01:56,773
- That fool's crazy. I'm out of here.
- Wait. Did I pass?

28
00:01:59,085 --> 00:02:02,452
<i>No, Bo, you sure as shit didn't,
but you got Tasered</i>

29
00:02:02,522 --> 00:02:04,114
<i>and I hear that's fun.</i>

30
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:10,754
<i>You might think Bo was
the crown prince of public mayhem,</i>

31
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:14,459
<i>but four counties over, there was
another contender vying for that throne,</i>

32
00:02:14,534 --> 00:02:16,434
<i>his cousin, Luke Duke.</i>

33
00:02:16,769 --> 00:02:18,100
<i>This poor green pup thought</i>

34
00:02:18,171 --> 00:02:20,765
<i>that the way to a woman's heart
was by blowing shit up.</i>

35
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,865
<i>Someday Luke will learn
that when it comes to women,</i>

36
00:02:22,942 --> 00:02:25,308
<i>he was focused on the wrong kind of bang.</i>

37
00:02:25,378 --> 00:02:27,710
She's a classy kid. Real lady.

38
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:30,275
Forget about her, Luke.

39
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:33,278
Let me show you your future
under this table here.

40
00:02:33,353 --> 00:02:37,483
I'm sorry, psychic whore,
but I've already seen my future.

41
00:02:37,624 --> 00:02:39,649
And it's with Debbie Sue.

42
00:02:40,727 --> 00:02:43,753
- Hey, are you ready?
- Hell, I better be ready.

43
00:02:45,064 --> 00:02:48,261
X 90 Armageddons,
Yellow Cycle of Thunders,

44
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:50,894
Nasty Napalmers that'll
peel back her eyelids,

45
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:54,303
blow off her silky golden hair,
melt her brain stem,

46
00:02:54,874 --> 00:02:56,774
and open up her heart.

47
00:02:56,943 --> 00:03:00,344
- And she knows this stuff is coming?
- She doesn't even know my name.

48
00:03:00,413 --> 00:03:01,437
Come on, let's go.

49
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:03,106
She will after tonight.

50
00:03:04,417 --> 00:03:05,782
Hey, Luke,

51
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:09,948
looks like your princess
is about ready to get her castle stormed.

52
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:13,057
<i>Sometimes you get so darn busy
planning the plan</i>

53
00:03:13,126 --> 00:03:15,754
<i>that you take your eyes off the prize,</i>

54
00:03:15,962 --> 00:03:18,328
<i>or maybe even blow the prize up.</i>

55
00:03:20,066 --> 00:03:21,590
Oh, shit.

56
00:03:31,778 --> 00:03:35,942
<i>I reckon Luke never planned on
carpet-bombing the county fair.</i>

57
00:03:36,316 --> 00:03:39,376
<i>Twenty injuries, 15 grand in damage,</i>

58
00:03:39,452 --> 00:03:41,886
<i>and Debbie Sue still doesn't know
Luke's name.</i>

59
00:03:41,955 --> 00:03:44,150
<i>Better luck next time, Romeo.</i>

60
00:03:44,524 --> 00:03:47,425
- Get up, get up.
- Luke, you could've killed someone.

61
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:50,720
<i>Bo's parents and Luke's parents
convinced the judges</i>

62
00:03:50,797 --> 00:03:55,359
<i>that the boys' salvation lay in a summer
of hard work on Uncle Jesse's farm,</i>

63
00:03:55,435 --> 00:03:57,528
<i>a taste of the simple life.</i>

64
00:03:57,937 --> 00:04:00,235
<i>Simple life. That's a good one.</i>

65
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:02,698
Hazzard County.

66
00:04:04,777 --> 00:04:05,903
Damn.

67
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:16,578
- What's so funny, Goldilocks?
- Two things always make me laugh.

68
00:04:17,223 --> 00:04:21,887
Monkeys dressed as humans, and
some pussy getting chucked off the bus.

69
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:25,261
How would like to spend
the night in the morgue?

70
00:04:25,331 --> 00:04:26,696
Show me the way.

71
00:04:31,204 --> 00:04:35,971
Hey, hey. Hey, guys. Nice to see
y'all cousins getting reacquainted.

72
00:04:36,843 --> 00:04:38,572
- Bo?
- Luke?

73
00:04:40,713 --> 00:04:42,044
Welcome to Hazzard.

74
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:43,343
- Thanks, Uncle Jesse.
- Uncle Jesse.

75
00:04:45,652 --> 00:04:47,950
Oh, I'll take the brunette,
you get the blonde.

76
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:50,581
Man, this J.D. Hogg
sure does like to smile.

77
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:53,185
He's got a lot to smile about.
He owns the whole town.

78
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:54,988
I knew him back
when he was messing his britches.

79
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:57,120
I think he smiled when he did that.

80
00:04:57,196 --> 00:04:59,756
He ain't a bad guy,
but just don't cross him.

81
00:04:59,832 --> 00:05:02,300
Oh, my goodness,
some things have changed.

82
00:05:03,102 --> 00:05:06,663
Corals and cocktails, coz.
I just found Jesus. Yeah!

83
00:05:06,739 --> 00:05:07,763
Yeah.

84
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,001
Keep the garden hoses
in your trousers, boys.

85
00:05:10,076 --> 00:05:11,703
Lot of fun to water the lawn,

86
00:05:11,778 --> 00:05:15,771
but then you got to feed the flowers
and then you got to send them to school.

87
00:05:15,848 --> 00:05:18,510
- Same old truck.
- Yeah. Same old truck.

88
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,222
Hey, Ab.

89
00:05:36,936 --> 00:05:40,099
Come on, already.
I'm gonna be 175 by the time he gets here.

90
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:43,199
Only running he's done is against J.D.
For county commissioner.

91
00:05:43,276 --> 00:05:45,210
How you doing, Ab?

92
00:05:45,278 --> 00:05:47,405
Got your medicine for you, old buddy.

93
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:50,108
Reach in there and grab you two
what you like.

94
00:05:57,724 --> 00:06:00,522
I hear you, buddy. See you next week.
Go get 'em.

95
00:06:01,594 --> 00:06:03,425
That's his medicine?

96
00:06:03,763 --> 00:06:07,494
Well, he's 112 years old.
I bring him his medicine every week.

97
00:06:07,567 --> 00:06:12,061
He's got scurvy, malaria, rickets,
chlamydia. You name it, he's got it.

98
00:06:12,972 --> 00:06:14,462
Come on, let's go see Daisy.

99
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,531
- Shotgun.
- Nope, I got here first.

100
00:06:16,609 --> 00:06:18,167
Get in first.

101
00:06:20,913 --> 00:06:24,576
- Whoa.
- Look out for the dog, Uncle Jesse!

102
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:29,577
<i>You ever wanna find
Sheriff Rosco P. Coltrane,</i>

103
00:06:29,655 --> 00:06:33,147
<i>go 10 blocks past sanity
and take a right on crazy.</i>

104
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:34,488
Hang on there, Jesse.

105
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,822
<i>Can't miss him.</i>

106
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:40,161
Ordinance 733. Hound dogs have
the right of way here in Hazzard County.

107
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,233
That's great detective work, Rosco.
But it ain't no crime.

108
00:06:43,302 --> 00:06:46,237
Maybe lipping off
to an officer of the law is, there,

109
00:06:46,305 --> 00:06:49,832
- Blue Jeans and Bongo Drums.
- We didn't want to hit your dog.

110
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:52,776
Now was I talking to you, there,
Johnny Jingle Nuts?

111
00:06:52,845 --> 00:06:55,006
Ain't you got nothing better to do?

112
00:06:55,548 --> 00:07:00,144
Well, maybe I could stuff you
in my hold there, little partner.

113
00:07:00,219 --> 00:07:02,949
And you could collect
toenail clippings for fun.

114
00:07:03,689 --> 00:07:05,816
Now, you all just mind yourself.

115
00:07:05,892 --> 00:07:09,521
'Cause this here
is Rosco P. Coltrane's jurisdiction.

116
00:07:10,329 --> 00:07:13,730
I'll send you straight to hell
in a bucket of chicken.

117
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,267
Come on, kid.

118
00:07:16,202 --> 00:07:19,660
Old Rosco ain't never fired that gun,
but he's always looking for a reason.

119
00:07:19,739 --> 00:07:21,468
Let's don't give him one.

120
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:29,778
Oh, man, pigtails. I love pigtails.

121
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:38,052
Daisy'll introduce us to the hot locals.

122
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:40,558
- So we can tag some wild game.
- Yeah.

123
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:43,857
And then you can stop beating off
to them breast exam ads.

124
00:07:46,566 --> 00:07:48,158
Hey, guys. Hey.

125
00:07:48,234 --> 00:07:49,462
<i>Daisy Duke.</i>

126
00:07:49,535 --> 00:07:53,096
<i>You can't see it yet, but there's a woman
waiting to burst out of her</i>

127
00:07:53,172 --> 00:07:54,469
<i>like an alien invader.</i>

128
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:58,601
I promised her folks I wouldn't let her date
until she's 18 and she just hit 18.

129
00:07:58,678 --> 00:08:00,703
And she's turning some heads.

130
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,980
What kind of heads is she turning?

131
00:08:03,049 --> 00:08:05,540
<i>And never far behind, Enos Strate.</i>

132
00:08:05,885 --> 00:08:09,480
<i>He likes to hover waiting
to come to her rescue. Kind of sweet.</i>

133
00:08:09,555 --> 00:08:10,988
Look at you.

134
00:08:12,124 --> 00:08:13,523
Oh, hey, Daisy.

135
00:08:13,593 --> 00:08:16,494
Y'all are cuter than boxing gloves
on a kitten.

136
00:08:16,562 --> 00:08:19,554
- Hi, Uncle Jesse.
- Hi. How was Bible school?

137
00:08:19,632 --> 00:08:22,795
Well, Pastor Phil says,
you know, that being a virgin's cool,

138
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:24,928
so all us girls in class, we signed this oath

139
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:27,404
saying we won't have sex until marriage.

140
00:08:28,074 --> 00:08:30,941
These are all the things we can't do.

141
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:34,504
Anyway, me and the girls are
real psyched about being virgins.

142
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:37,105
- All the girls signed this?
- You bet.

143
00:08:37,283 --> 00:08:39,751
Can't wait to be a virgin again.

144
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,647
Luke, honey, you crying?

145
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:46,390
Just happy to see you, Daisy.

146
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:50,757
The Lord loves y'all.

147
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:54,061
He just wants you to know he'll be
with you all summer, too. Huh, Daisy?

148
00:08:54,133 --> 00:08:58,001
Right. This is gonna be
the best summer ever.

149
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:04,437
You know what we should be doing
with this shit?

150
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:05,907
Should be blowin' this shit up.

151
00:09:05,978 --> 00:09:07,775
Hey, you know you can make
low-grade bombs with manure?

152
00:09:07,847 --> 00:09:09,439
Whoa! What are you doing?

153
00:09:09,515 --> 00:09:12,507
- I'm going fast, so I can get done.
- Oh, yeah.

154
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:16,181
Okay, truce. Jeez.

155
00:09:16,522 --> 00:09:20,481
Wash up. Come on in for supper.
We got ham hocks, pickles, pig's feet.

156
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,495
And you can finish shoveling that manure
after you have your dessert.

157
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:24,757
Then we're done?

158
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:27,128
Then you got to go down by the road
and fix the fence,

159
00:09:27,199 --> 00:09:29,429
feed the chickens and bale some hay.

160
00:09:29,502 --> 00:09:32,835
So, we work, what, all the time?

161
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:36,606
No, well, not all the time.
You get four solid hours of sleep.

162
00:09:36,676 --> 00:09:39,645
And remember,
Annabelle can't inseminate herself.

163
00:09:45,017 --> 00:09:46,006
God!

164
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:56,291
<i>Nothing like a good day's rest
after an honest day's work.</i>

165
00:09:56,729 --> 00:10:00,096
<i>Unless, of course,
you're planning your escape.</i>

166
00:10:13,479 --> 00:10:15,174
Vintage Luke Duke.

167
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:18,512
Sneaking off without me again?

168
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:21,082
What's that supposed to mean?

169
00:10:21,153 --> 00:10:24,816
I'm 10, you're 11. The nurses' school.

170
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:30,126
The nurses.
You didn't want to climb that tree.

171
00:10:30,229 --> 00:10:34,165
You wanted to map it out, draw
a diagram, take a course in tree climbing,

172
00:10:34,233 --> 00:10:36,531
but I convinced you.

173
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,365
What did you see?

174
00:10:38,604 --> 00:10:40,435
I saw boobies.

175
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:43,604
Big boobies, little boobies,

176
00:10:44,243 --> 00:10:47,838
classy boobies, I saw a feast of boobies.

177
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:51,345
The Thanksgiving Day Parade of boobies.

178
00:10:52,251 --> 00:10:53,775
And did you thank me?

179
00:10:55,621 --> 00:10:56,952
Thank you.

180
00:10:57,723 --> 00:11:00,351
No, you heard someone coming
and you got down.

181
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:03,652
I've had a lifetime of boobies.

182
00:11:03,729 --> 00:11:06,926
But I will never, ever forget
you leaving me.

183
00:11:08,067 --> 00:11:11,195
Six years ago, all right? I was a little kid.

184
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:23,042
Sweet ride.

185
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:29,952
Uncle Jesse's friends with a pimp?

186
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,180
Boss Hogg.

187
00:11:32,258 --> 00:11:33,987
- That man knows how to live.
- That's business.

188
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:37,621
Money, power, probably got a hot wife.

189
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:38,959
Definitely no farmer.

190
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:40,726
Yeah.

191
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,463
The Boar's Nest is kicking! It's
an election year. Put that on, dumpling.

192
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:45,834
- Here you go, darling.
- Oh, thank you.

193
00:11:45,905 --> 00:11:47,236
I'm going in.

194
00:11:47,473 --> 00:11:49,236
Bo, don't... Bo!

195
00:11:51,677 --> 00:11:53,008
Boys.

196
00:11:53,579 --> 00:11:54,705
Hi, fellas.

197
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:58,006
- What is this place?
- I don't know.

198
00:11:58,984 --> 00:12:02,920
But four slices of a sex pie
just walked right through that door.

199
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:07,457
I think they need a little scoop of Bo
on top.

200
00:12:08,694 --> 00:12:11,663
Whoa! Where do you think
you boys are going?

201
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:13,429
We're with them.

202
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:19,401
Okay. Thank you.

203
00:12:19,972 --> 00:12:21,439
Nice sleeves.

204
00:12:22,675 --> 00:12:25,735
No place for minors
is definitely a place for us.

205
00:12:25,811 --> 00:12:28,075
- There's got to be another way in.
- Let's go.

206
00:12:28,147 --> 00:12:30,138
- Whoa, ladies.
- Yeah.

207
00:12:30,282 --> 00:12:32,273
- Well, what have we got here?
- Let me know.

208
00:12:32,351 --> 00:12:33,477
- Okay.
- Bye.

209
00:12:35,721 --> 00:12:37,313
Hello, folks, how you doing?

210
00:12:37,389 --> 00:12:39,289
How are you doing?

211
00:12:39,391 --> 00:12:41,484
- How y'all doing?
- You called my mother a what?

212
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,118
Not gonna take that.

213
00:12:44,497 --> 00:12:46,727
- Look at that.
- There you go. Great shot.

214
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:48,061
J.D. Hogg is in the house.

215
00:12:48,134 --> 00:12:51,365
Hey, now,
they're fighting over you, there, Joanne.

216
00:12:51,871 --> 00:12:53,031
Hey.

217
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:56,836
Hey, hey, hey. You wanna piece of him,
you better take a piece of me.

218
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,513
It's locked.

219
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:06,084
- I'm going this way.
- Wait up.

220
00:13:09,188 --> 00:13:11,884
<i>Boss Hogg's prize boar Dainty.</i>

221
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:15,916
<i>Three time state champ
and a close second in J.D. 's heart,</i>

222
00:13:15,995 --> 00:13:18,122
<i>after his wife Lulu.</i>

223
00:13:18,197 --> 00:13:19,960
It's Hogg's hog.

224
00:13:22,601 --> 00:13:24,262
Stay. Sit.

225
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:32,910
- So, how's Lulu?
- Expensive.

226
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:36,641
My wife's got a jewelry habit that'd
make a crack whore look sensible.

227
00:13:36,715 --> 00:13:39,081
Lucky you're the richest guy
in Hazzard, huh?

228
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:40,948
Yeah. It's good enough
for a county commissioner.

229
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:42,146
But what about the future?

230
00:13:42,221 --> 00:13:47,090
Governor Hogg.
President Hogg. Prime Minister Hogg.

231
00:13:47,593 --> 00:13:51,154
- Well, I ain't much into politics.
- These things cost big bucks.

232
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:59,801
Seems my temporary blindness
to your illegal activities

233
00:13:59,872 --> 00:14:02,705
- should be worth more like 10%/º.
- Oh, it is.

234
00:14:02,975 --> 00:14:05,466
- Undying friendship.
- Which is nice.

235
00:14:06,111 --> 00:14:08,272
But I'm thinking more like 25%/º.

236
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:11,145
Well, I ain't making a lot of money
out there selling shine.

237
00:14:11,217 --> 00:14:13,151
I'm paying a few bills,
but I ain't getting rich.

238
00:14:13,219 --> 00:14:15,153
Which brings me to my next proposal.

239
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:18,520
It's high time we expand
your little operation, sell abroad.

240
00:14:18,591 --> 00:14:20,320
I ain't selling no broads.

241
00:14:21,994 --> 00:14:23,359
- That's good.
- Yeah.

242
00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:25,829
Yeah. No, I'm talking
about neighboring counties.

243
00:14:25,898 --> 00:14:29,425
I can't afford to go to jail.
I've got three young'uns that I'm raising.

244
00:14:29,501 --> 00:14:32,231
You're thinking small, Jesse.
We could be partners.

245
00:14:32,304 --> 00:14:34,568
Rich as rich, chocolatey Ovaltine.

246
00:14:37,576 --> 00:14:41,444
I really don't think it's right that
I cut you in after you've been elected.

247
00:14:41,513 --> 00:14:45,108
- It's kind of like bribery, don't you think?
- It is bribery, Jesse.

248
00:14:45,184 --> 00:14:47,243
What the hell you think
we've been doing out there,

249
00:14:47,319 --> 00:14:49,583
selling cotton candy to nuns?

250
00:14:49,688 --> 00:14:51,883
One way or the other,
I'm gonna get my money.

251
00:14:51,957 --> 00:14:55,916
You got two weeks, then I'm sending
Rosco out to foreclose on the farm.

252
00:14:55,995 --> 00:14:57,895
No more slipping on payments.

253
00:15:01,767 --> 00:15:03,667
- Hey, where did she go?
- Who?

254
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:05,033
Who?

255
00:15:05,671 --> 00:15:08,435
Come on, we'll save you, Dainty.

256
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:10,436
Hang on, girl.

257
00:15:10,676 --> 00:15:12,234
Come on.

258
00:15:14,346 --> 00:15:16,712
No, no. Hold on. Come on.

259
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:20,409
Oh, no.

260
00:15:23,689 --> 00:15:27,682
- Would you pull, Bo?
- That is... What did she eat?

261
00:15:35,834 --> 00:15:37,301
Dainty!

262
00:15:42,141 --> 00:15:43,608
Dainty!

263
00:15:46,211 --> 00:15:49,044
Did you meet my nephews over there,
Bo and Luke?

264
00:15:49,915 --> 00:15:52,611
Y'all better pray my girl survives.

265
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,852
Two weeks and your farm is mine.

266
00:15:56,922 --> 00:16:00,358
Dukes have been living and dying
on this farm for 150 years.

267
00:16:00,426 --> 00:16:03,862
Great Grandpa Duke built this
out of a bucket of nails and a rock.

268
00:16:03,929 --> 00:16:07,262
My pa died sitting in that chair
right where you are, Luke.

269
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:09,597
Shat himself
and then went gently into the night.

270
00:16:09,668 --> 00:16:11,363
God rest his soul.

271
00:16:12,104 --> 00:16:14,072
Hell, I was born right here on this table.

272
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:18,007
Mama's water broke, I popped out there
like a log ride at a water park.

273
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,911
I can't lose my home.

274
00:16:23,382 --> 00:16:25,407
Look, I'll get a job at the Boar's Nest.

275
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:28,009
And I'll crack open some shine
to settle our nerves.

276
00:16:28,087 --> 00:16:30,021
Can't wait for that tasty beverage.

277
00:16:30,089 --> 00:16:32,387
You ain't never drinking that shine.
You hear me?

278
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:33,686
Now, J.D.'s mad.

279
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:37,092
And that stunt y'all pulled
with the flying pig didn't help none.

280
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:38,686
And he's gonna collect.

281
00:16:38,764 --> 00:16:40,322
And I couldn't make enough shine

282
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:43,197
and still have time to run it
and cover the loan.

283
00:16:46,939 --> 00:16:49,134
No. But we could.

284
00:16:50,542 --> 00:16:52,407
Hell, yeah. We could run it.

285
00:16:52,478 --> 00:16:54,969
Us working together,
we'd come up with the money.

286
00:16:55,047 --> 00:16:57,379
No, your folks sent y'all down here
to be good men,

287
00:16:57,449 --> 00:16:58,848
not to be shine runners.

288
00:16:58,917 --> 00:17:01,545
And if you get throwed in jail,
you could be there a long time.

289
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:03,554
Listen, Uncle Jesse.
We don't have a choice.

290
00:17:03,622 --> 00:17:05,613
All we have is two weeks.

291
00:17:05,724 --> 00:17:08,887
- Lf we sell enough...
- And we're quick enough...

292
00:17:09,061 --> 00:17:11,393
You don't have to worry
about Boss Hogg again.

293
00:17:11,463 --> 00:17:13,897
We're Dukes. This is our farm, too.

294
00:17:13,966 --> 00:17:17,629
- And no one's taking it from us.
- It ain't a bad idea, Uncle Jesse.

295
00:17:18,904 --> 00:17:20,531
All we need is...

296
00:17:21,774 --> 00:17:24,402
- A fast car.
- Yeah.

297
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:30,378
<i>There's an old saying
that the journey of a thousand miles</i>

298
00:17:30,449 --> 00:17:32,349
<i>begins with a single step.</i>

299
00:17:32,418 --> 00:17:36,912
<i>Sometimes those steps can be blocked
by a bunch of annoying little girls.</i>

300
00:17:37,289 --> 00:17:40,816
- Hello, tiny girls.
- Excuse me, ladies.

301
00:17:41,193 --> 00:17:45,527
Have any of you adorable little tykes seen
a super-charged,

302
00:17:45,597 --> 00:17:49,260
high performance, V-8 engine
laying around here anywhere?

303
00:17:49,334 --> 00:17:51,564
Look, we're 9, what do you want from us?

304
00:17:51,637 --> 00:17:54,504
Oh, that's it. Come here. Come here.

305
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:57,701
Oh, you hide behind those pigtails
and those braces, come on. Come on.

306
00:17:57,776 --> 00:17:59,505
Man, that guy's an idiot.

307
00:18:02,381 --> 00:18:04,246
She ain't worth it.

308
00:18:04,316 --> 00:18:06,841
Yeah. She's lucky you won't beat up
anything under 10.

309
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:08,750
She's lucky I got standards.

310
00:18:10,489 --> 00:18:13,583
A gasoline bomb just detonated
in my heart.

311
00:18:14,626 --> 00:18:17,356
- Who are they?
- The Handy sisters.

312
00:18:17,663 --> 00:18:21,497
Brooke and Ali. Look, those girls
have reps for doing anything.

313
00:18:22,134 --> 00:18:24,193
- Stay away.
- Oh, definitely.

314
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:26,328
Definitely gonna stay away
from the girls who'll do anything.

315
00:18:26,405 --> 00:18:28,873
Sound advice. I'm gonna go talk to them.

316
00:18:29,007 --> 00:18:32,272
Who needs to talk when you got
a blonde river on your head?

317
00:18:32,344 --> 00:18:34,642
- Bo, let me talk to them.
- Blonde river.

318
00:18:34,713 --> 00:18:36,476
- Talk.
- Blonde river.

319
00:18:43,555 --> 00:18:44,817
Hello, up there.

320
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:46,585
- Hey, y'all.
- Hi.

321
00:18:46,725 --> 00:18:49,193
Yeah. I'm Luke. Cousin Bo.

322
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:52,260
- Charmed.
- Seriously?

323
00:18:52,331 --> 00:18:53,992
Thanks.

324
00:18:55,267 --> 00:18:56,632
That is awesome.

325
00:18:57,102 --> 00:18:58,330
Fellas.

326
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:03,137
We gotta go.
We got some business to attend to.

327
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:04,402
We do?

328
00:19:04,843 --> 00:19:07,744
We do. It was nice chatting with you.

329
00:19:09,248 --> 00:19:10,374
Come on.

330
00:19:11,617 --> 00:19:13,983
<i>So, they set out to find the perfect car.</i>

331
00:19:14,052 --> 00:19:17,419
<i>Starting at the high school,
where kids learn reading, writing</i>

332
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:19,184
<i>and the real meaning of third base.</i>

333
00:19:19,258 --> 00:19:22,523
There's only one guy I know
who is a genius with cars.

334
00:19:22,594 --> 00:19:26,496
Are sure, Daisy? I mean, we need
a serious garage, not some high school.

335
00:19:26,565 --> 00:19:29,432
<i>They might cut home economics
and the debate squad,</i>

336
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:32,629
<i>but there's always room in the budget
for shop class in Hazzard.</i>

337
00:19:32,704 --> 00:19:34,638
How come boys never notice me?

338
00:19:34,706 --> 00:19:38,301
'Cause you're dressed like a lady golfer
who likes to swoon lady bikers.

339
00:19:38,377 --> 00:19:41,904
No, he's kidding. You're more of
a lady construction worker on her day off.

340
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:44,915
So, where is this engine whiz
you've been talking about?

341
00:19:44,983 --> 00:19:46,951
Somebody call my name?

342
00:19:49,922 --> 00:19:51,014
Hey. Hey.

343
00:19:52,124 --> 00:19:54,615
- Daisy Duke.
- Cooter.

344
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:56,991
These are my cousins, Bo and Luke.

345
00:19:57,062 --> 00:20:00,896
Pleasure to meet you,
Sweet Innocent and Dark Mystery.

346
00:20:00,966 --> 00:20:04,197
Just nicknames. Take 'em or leave 'em.

347
00:20:04,269 --> 00:20:07,636
My stars. That is real nice.

348
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:10,174
Hey, I'll bet that breathes real good,
doesn't it?

349
00:20:10,242 --> 00:20:13,109
- Are you the shop teacher?
- Hell, no. I'm a student.

350
00:20:13,178 --> 00:20:16,204
- Daisy tells us you know cars.
- Cars? Yes.

351
00:20:16,582 --> 00:20:18,243
Look at this baby.

352
00:20:18,684 --> 00:20:20,549
Math and history? No.

353
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:24,150
A high school diploma remains
just out of reach.

354
00:20:24,256 --> 00:20:28,590
Lord willing and the creek don't rise,
they'll let me be a senior a fourth time.

355
00:20:28,961 --> 00:20:31,896
There's still much work to be done here.

356
00:20:31,964 --> 00:20:35,229
- We need something reliable.
- Something with speed.

357
00:20:35,534 --> 00:20:37,058
Speed I can do.

358
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:39,969
My trademark? Horns.

359
00:20:48,013 --> 00:20:49,412
That song needs work.

360
00:20:49,481 --> 00:20:52,382
Okay, you want something
a little more edgier, then?

361
00:20:53,685 --> 00:20:55,676
What do you say,
we test drive this sucker, huh?

362
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:58,052
Well, shit. I'll try anything once.

363
00:20:58,123 --> 00:21:01,058
Except guy-on-guy. I'm just kidding.

364
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:03,053
I'd try that.

365
00:21:03,829 --> 00:21:07,094
All right. Come on.
I got the perfect place to open her up.

366
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:15,263
Watch out. Watch your back.
Coming through.

367
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:17,137
Excuse me. Pardon me.

368
00:21:19,411 --> 00:21:21,743
- Whoa!
- Look out, man.

369
00:21:21,813 --> 00:21:23,747
Coming through. Bo Duke.

370
00:21:25,817 --> 00:21:27,409
You're gonna kill us, Bo.

371
00:21:27,486 --> 00:21:31,582
<i>Here's a little reminder that we live
in the greatest country on the planet.</i>

372
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:33,452
Oh, man.

373
00:21:33,592 --> 00:21:34,581
Hello, ladies.

374
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:36,252
Oh, you missed a spot.

375
00:21:39,197 --> 00:21:40,186
Hey!

376
00:21:46,171 --> 00:21:47,866
Please don't touch that!

377
00:21:49,508 --> 00:21:51,032
Get back and help me.

378
00:21:56,948 --> 00:21:59,542
Bo, you can't go there.
Don't be driving down the halls like that.

379
00:21:59,618 --> 00:22:01,643
You can't be driving
down the halls like that.

380
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:04,621
Slow down. Pull that thing over.

381
00:22:05,424 --> 00:22:07,221
Oh, no. Oh, man.

382
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:13,123
- Well, I could jump it.
- It?

383
00:22:13,265 --> 00:22:14,562
Her. It.

384
00:22:14,633 --> 00:22:16,931
Whatever. I can jump it.

385
00:22:24,376 --> 00:22:25,775
Hot damn.

386
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:29,780
I ain't seen moves like that since a tornado
touched down in Miss Lally's class

387
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:32,578
and ended the evolution debate
once and for all.

388
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:35,546
- Hey, Enos.
- Cooter.

389
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:39,181
- Are you mixed up with them?
- Like a mixed romaine salad

390
00:22:39,257 --> 00:22:41,657
topped with vinaigrette and pecans.

391
00:22:42,761 --> 00:22:44,888
- Hi, Enos.
- Hi, Daisy.

392
00:22:44,963 --> 00:22:46,988
Looks like you got manhandled.

393
00:22:47,065 --> 00:22:51,001
Actually, it was the JV cheerleading
squad. Thank God it wasn't varsity.

394
00:22:51,236 --> 00:22:54,000
Listen, Enos. My cousins are new in town.

395
00:22:54,072 --> 00:22:57,064
Maybe, as my friend, you can let them go.
Just this once.

396
00:22:57,142 --> 00:23:00,043
Oh, sure, Daisy. For you.

397
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:03,440
Let's get you back together.

398
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:07,712
They don't teach you about cheerleaders
in training you to be a hall monitor.

399
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:09,850
I'd say you can handle that engine, Cooter.

400
00:23:09,921 --> 00:23:11,149
Yeah?

401
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:14,659
Now all we need is the perfect body.

402
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:18,787
Boys, I feel like I've been failing
my whole life for this moment.

403
00:23:18,964 --> 00:23:20,659
Come on. I know a place. Hop in.

404
00:23:22,434 --> 00:23:23,958
<i>The county junkyard.</i>

405
00:23:24,102 --> 00:23:26,570
<i>Yep. You might see
nothing but piles of junk,</i>

406
00:23:26,638 --> 00:23:31,041
<i>but these boys see warm dollops of clay
ripe for sculpting into greatness.</i>

407
00:23:37,716 --> 00:23:40,184
What are you looking for, Buddha?

408
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:43,710
My gut is gonna tell me
when I've found the right car.

409
00:23:44,055 --> 00:23:47,320
All right, don't question me on this
and I won't question you on being a virgin.

410
00:23:47,392 --> 00:23:48,825
All right, who told you that, huh?

411
00:23:48,894 --> 00:23:51,055
I want names, addresses, phone numbers,
next of kin.

412
00:23:51,129 --> 00:23:53,029
'Cause I've slept
with thousands of women.

413
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:55,259
Oh, well, that's smart in this day and age.

414
00:23:55,333 --> 00:23:58,097
Well, we're all virgins
till we've been with the one that we love.

415
00:23:58,170 --> 00:24:00,798
Well, that's good. Except I ain't a virgin.

416
00:24:00,872 --> 00:24:02,999
Virginity ain't a crime, now.

417
00:24:03,175 --> 00:24:05,200
Except in the State of Bo.

418
00:24:06,645 --> 00:24:08,010
Watch this.

419
00:24:13,151 --> 00:24:14,277
I'm okay.

420
00:24:16,855 --> 00:24:19,016
What's with sliding across the hood.

421
00:24:20,692 --> 00:24:24,924
Why would I waste my time
walking all the way around the car?

422
00:24:25,397 --> 00:24:27,058
Think, Luke.
You're supposed to be the smart one.

423
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:28,861
I'm the good-looking one.

424
00:24:30,535 --> 00:24:33,265
I know the right car is here somewhere.

425
00:24:34,773 --> 00:24:35,831
Bo.

426
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:41,412
I admire his passion, but that boy is crazy.

427
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:46,212
Well, what do you say we call it a day?

428
00:24:46,785 --> 00:24:49,720
Go cool off. Get some smoothies.
I know a place.

429
00:24:49,888 --> 00:24:52,118
- All right.
- Come on, big guy.

430
00:24:53,391 --> 00:24:56,485
Boys, welcome to Hogg's Ravine.

431
00:24:57,562 --> 00:25:00,588
- Is there anything Hogg doesn't own?
- Nope.

432
00:25:00,932 --> 00:25:03,730
But one day,
I'm gonna open up my own garage.

433
00:25:03,802 --> 00:25:05,793
Cooter's Garage.

434
00:25:06,271 --> 00:25:09,570
It'll have my name on it.
Boss ain't gonna own that.

435
00:25:09,741 --> 00:25:11,333
Hey, what's on the other side
of the ravine?

436
00:25:11,409 --> 00:25:13,604
Factory for Hogg's ice cream.

437
00:25:14,145 --> 00:25:17,637
- Hogg makes ice cream?
- Yup, yup, yup. I never had any,

438
00:25:17,716 --> 00:25:21,015
but I heard
the peach melba's absolutely outrageous.

439
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:24,817
Anyway, no one's allowed over there.
Road's all gated up.

440
00:25:25,056 --> 00:25:27,354
Boss is very protective of his recipe.

441
00:25:28,059 --> 00:25:29,390
Hey, boys.

442
00:25:33,899 --> 00:25:36,629
Sunny-side up or over easy?
Call it in the air.

443
00:25:37,269 --> 00:25:38,668
I've always been a breast man.

444
00:25:38,737 --> 00:25:41,331
Okay, you take the rack, I'll take the back.

445
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:45,369
Watch and learn, Luke. Watch and learn.

446
00:25:49,848 --> 00:25:51,839
Ladies, do me.

447
00:25:55,086 --> 00:25:57,179
Hey, girls, watch me.

448
00:25:59,024 --> 00:26:01,254
- Why you got to go and do that?
- I like it.

449
00:26:01,326 --> 00:26:03,760
- Anybody ever dive in there?
- Sometimes.

450
00:26:15,507 --> 00:26:16,804
I'll be dipped.

451
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:21,070
You said people dive in here all the time.
I thought it was safe.

452
00:26:21,146 --> 00:26:24,377
Oh, no, hell, no.
I said sometimes people dive.

453
00:26:24,449 --> 00:26:26,508
Most of the time they end up crippled or

454
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:28,917
- on life support or brain damaged.
- Oh, man.

455
00:26:28,987 --> 00:26:30,079
Just depends.

456
00:26:30,155 --> 00:26:32,385
Oh, man. I'm coming for you, Luke.

457
00:26:50,008 --> 00:26:52,135
Come on. Don't die on me, now.

458
00:26:52,877 --> 00:26:56,472
<i>You'd think Bo'd be under water
looking for his drowning cousin.</i>

459
00:26:56,548 --> 00:26:58,709
<i>But it's hard to think
about your loved ones</i>

460
00:26:58,783 --> 00:27:01,343
<i>when you've found a sunken treasure.</i>

461
00:27:04,255 --> 00:27:05,244
Breathe.

462
00:27:10,061 --> 00:27:11,824
Score one for Cooter.

463
00:27:11,896 --> 00:27:13,830
There is a car down there.

464
00:27:13,898 --> 00:27:15,627
Thanks for saving me, Bo.

465
00:27:41,926 --> 00:27:43,951
It's a '69 Dodge Charger.

466
00:27:44,429 --> 00:27:46,920
Well, I'll be mud on a frog's back.

467
00:27:47,399 --> 00:27:50,994
Hey, back in my pop's day, they used to
dare each other to jump the ravine.

468
00:27:51,069 --> 00:27:53,469
Some stupid son of a bitch tried.

469
00:27:53,772 --> 00:27:56,900
- Sounds like he didn't make it.
- Nobody can. It's impossible.

470
00:27:56,975 --> 00:27:59,375
Car must not be that hot, neither.

471
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:03,345
No. That is the car. I can feel it.

472
00:28:06,251 --> 00:28:08,242
It just hasn't found the right driver yet.

473
00:28:23,101 --> 00:28:25,092
It's from the Civil War.

474
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:32,463
What's your lucky number, Bo?

475
00:29:34,205 --> 00:29:35,263
One.

476
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:52,048
<i>Ain't that just about
the most beautiful thing you've ever seen?</i>

477
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:55,752
<i>That car kicks so much ass
it should have feet.</i>

478
00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:02,632
- Why you gotta go and do that?
- Because it's cool.

479
00:30:02,867 --> 00:30:04,994
You sure you don't want me
to weld your side shut?

480
00:30:05,069 --> 00:30:06,900
- No.
- All right.

481
00:30:10,108 --> 00:30:12,099
- Ready, coz?
- Ready, coz.

482
00:30:13,011 --> 00:30:16,811
All right, boys, listen.
This little baby here... Oh, sorry.

483
00:30:16,881 --> 00:30:18,246
That's mechanic talk.

484
00:30:18,316 --> 00:30:22,980
This car, well, it's got enough parts,
it'd make the Pentagon wet.

485
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:25,820
All right? Break it in nice and easy.

486
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:28,587
Race you.

487
00:30:42,574 --> 00:30:44,007
Go, Bo!

488
00:30:45,176 --> 00:30:46,871
I'm not gonna see that car for a while,
am I?

489
00:30:46,945 --> 00:30:48,310
I don't think so.

490
00:31:10,635 --> 00:31:12,569
Oh, my goodness.

491
00:31:13,638 --> 00:31:16,334
I wanna paint. I wanna sail.

492
00:31:16,741 --> 00:31:19,005
I wanna help old people and children.

493
00:31:19,077 --> 00:31:23,571
But most of all, I wanna drive this car
right through the sound barrier.

494
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:25,013
Oh, my God.

495
00:31:26,851 --> 00:31:30,480
Bo just discovered religion and Cooter.

496
00:31:30,755 --> 00:31:33,223
Cooter, you're his prophet.
Thank you, man.

497
00:31:33,291 --> 00:31:35,725
- Thank you. Thank you.
- It's okay, pal.

498
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:38,856
I promised myself I wouldn't cry today.

499
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:40,295
Look at me.

500
00:31:40,865 --> 00:31:43,163
You're an honorary Duke now, Cooter.

501
00:31:43,868 --> 00:31:45,233
You know, when I was a Ridge Runner

502
00:31:45,303 --> 00:31:47,737
moving shine and leaving them cops
choking in my dust,

503
00:31:47,805 --> 00:31:50,535
we used to name our cars after generals.

504
00:31:51,476 --> 00:31:55,810
Oh, well, then, this should be named
after the greatest of all.

505
00:31:57,582 --> 00:31:59,311
General Lee.

506
00:32:02,854 --> 00:32:05,687
You know, running shine is a lot
like knowing how to kill a man

507
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:07,088
with your thumb 12 ways.

508
00:32:07,158 --> 00:32:08,989
It ain't really that hard
once you know how,

509
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:10,186
but you got to practice at it.

510
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:12,422
You can kill a man with your thumb?

511
00:32:13,731 --> 00:32:15,289
Forget that part.
Here's what you got to remember.

512
00:32:15,366 --> 00:32:18,494
It's more than just speed out here.
You got to be smart.

513
00:32:18,569 --> 00:32:20,764
Been going over this map of Hazzard.

514
00:32:21,472 --> 00:32:23,770
- I think I got our routes figured out.
- Well, that's good.

515
00:32:23,841 --> 00:32:25,069
But you got to improvise.

516
00:32:25,143 --> 00:32:29,102
Unforeseen circumstances come up
quicker than a stiffy on prom night.

517
00:32:30,148 --> 00:32:33,515
Best advice I ever had was
from an old moonshiner buddy of mine,

518
00:32:33,584 --> 00:32:37,042
- old "Three Nipples" Ned.
- The man had three nipples?

519
00:32:37,221 --> 00:32:40,713
No, he really had four,
but we didn't want to call attention to it.

520
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:43,818
So he told us on his death bed,
he said these three words.

521
00:32:43,895 --> 00:32:48,025
- He said, "Don't get caught."
- Cops got him?

522
00:32:48,099 --> 00:32:52,035
No, actually it was Emmy Lou Hassett.
It was that tertiary syphilis.

523
00:32:52,704 --> 00:32:54,331
That's another thing
you want to remember, now.

524
00:32:54,405 --> 00:32:56,396
If you don't want your pecker
to feel like a flame-thrower,

525
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:58,203
you better wear a rubber.

526
00:32:58,409 --> 00:33:01,674
Uncle Jesse, don't you think
we should sample the product

527
00:33:01,746 --> 00:33:04,044
- for our customers' sake?
- Yeah, Bo's right.

528
00:33:04,115 --> 00:33:06,049
I mean, people might have questions.

529
00:33:06,117 --> 00:33:09,280
I don't think y'all's folks want y'all
out here drinking and driving shine.

530
00:33:09,354 --> 00:33:11,982
Time to baptize the General. Come on.

531
00:33:28,639 --> 00:33:31,437
<i>For a week those boys tore
up and down the county,</i>

532
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:35,240
<i>making stops for every teacher,
preacher and milkmaid in sight.</i>

533
00:33:43,621 --> 00:33:47,955
<i>Bo and Luke became the fastest
shine runners in Hazzard history.</i>

534
00:34:36,974 --> 00:34:38,305
Holy water.

535
00:34:41,479 --> 00:34:42,673
Thank you.

536
00:34:50,154 --> 00:34:52,213
<i>So things were tasting sweeter</i>

537
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:55,316
<i>than applejack in a honeydew melon
for the Duke boys.</i>

538
00:34:55,393 --> 00:34:58,157
<i>But remember,
Daisy wanted to help out, too,</i>

539
00:34:58,229 --> 00:35:01,528
<i>and she'd be damned
if she wasn't gonna make a contribution.</i>

540
00:35:03,901 --> 00:35:05,960
<i>Well, a new face in Hazzard.</i>

541
00:35:06,037 --> 00:35:08,403
<i>Now, I'll tell you city folk
ain't really my type,</i>

542
00:35:08,473 --> 00:35:10,998
<i>but this was a flavor
Daisy had never tasted.</i>

543
00:35:11,075 --> 00:35:12,406
Excuse me.

544
00:35:13,244 --> 00:35:14,711
Oh, I'm so sorry.

545
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:17,009
I just want to see about a waitressing job.

546
00:35:17,081 --> 00:35:20,346
Look, don't worry.
A little water will take that right out.

547
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:22,878
Look.

548
00:35:24,155 --> 00:35:28,489
I'm not trying to be rude,
but you just don't have the right look

549
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:30,425
for the Nest.

550
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:35,493
These girls are tough, confident.

551
00:35:37,702 --> 00:35:40,034
Oh, right.

552
00:35:40,738 --> 00:35:41,898
Hey.

553
00:35:42,106 --> 00:35:45,371
<i>Her interviewing skills
leave something to be desired.</i>

554
00:35:45,443 --> 00:35:46,432
Thank you.

555
00:35:46,511 --> 00:35:51,813
<i>But she accomplished one thing.
Daisy done gone and got herself smitten.</i>

556
00:35:52,783 --> 00:35:54,011
Daisy?

557
00:35:55,052 --> 00:35:58,544
I just acted like a fool in front of the most
gorgeous, handsome man

558
00:35:58,623 --> 00:36:00,420
ever to come to Hazzard.

559
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:02,952
But I just got here.

560
00:36:03,928 --> 00:36:07,022
Ladies, hello.

561
00:36:07,565 --> 00:36:09,590
- Ladies.
- Hi.

562
00:36:10,268 --> 00:36:11,428
Brooke! Ali!

563
00:36:11,903 --> 00:36:14,531
Ladies! How you doing?

564
00:36:15,139 --> 00:36:17,198
- Cooter.
- Yeah?

565
00:36:18,709 --> 00:36:21,837
- Let's make a toast.
- Yes, yes, let's make a toast.

566
00:36:22,313 --> 00:36:24,474
To waking up in Chickasaw

567
00:36:24,549 --> 00:36:28,747
in the strong protective arms
of a female correctional officer.

568
00:36:29,453 --> 00:36:30,647
What a night!

569
00:36:36,994 --> 00:36:38,325
We're gonna go.

570
00:36:38,396 --> 00:36:40,921
Yeah, we're teaching erotic dance
at the senior center.

571
00:36:40,998 --> 00:36:43,398
And we're late. Sorry.

572
00:36:44,402 --> 00:36:45,892
- Don't go!
- Don't go!

573
00:36:47,171 --> 00:36:50,072
- Thanks a lot, Cooter.
- Was it the toast?

574
00:36:56,247 --> 00:36:57,373
Sorry.

575
00:36:59,383 --> 00:37:02,250
You guys came in
in that '69 Charger, right?

576
00:37:06,023 --> 00:37:07,490
The General Lee.

577
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:10,360
Hi, I'm Hughie, the new manager.

578
00:37:13,264 --> 00:37:14,390
Yeah.

579
00:37:18,469 --> 00:37:21,870
I thought you'd like some Hogg d'oeuvres
on the house. Well, come on.

580
00:37:21,939 --> 00:37:26,808
Those Boss Hoggs in a blanket
are absolutely magic.

581
00:37:26,877 --> 00:37:28,310
Yes, they are.

582
00:37:29,146 --> 00:37:33,344
So I got to say, you guys have
one killer orange car out there.

583
00:37:34,619 --> 00:37:38,282
Yeah, two things I can't live without.
My car

584
00:37:39,690 --> 00:37:41,123
and my cell phone.

585
00:37:41,225 --> 00:37:43,750
Except I can't get any reception
around here.

586
00:37:43,828 --> 00:37:47,320
- How do you guys survive?
- We use a CB.

587
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:53,198
A CB.

588
00:37:56,941 --> 00:38:00,240
Well, I have to get back to work,
but you know we should hang out

589
00:38:00,311 --> 00:38:02,142
if you guys know
anything to do around here.

590
00:38:02,213 --> 00:38:06,013
- Oh, yeah, we know lots to do.
- Yeah, all right. Excellent.

591
00:38:06,083 --> 00:38:08,483
Well, I'll see you guys around.

592
00:38:09,086 --> 00:38:14,114
Sorry, guys. Boss told me
to turn up the TV every time he's on.

593
00:38:14,225 --> 00:38:19,185
<i>Folks, Hazzard's sick. What's the cause?</i>

594
00:38:19,664 --> 00:38:22,292
Greedy shiners like these two

595
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:25,193
selling their liquid fire
to the unsuspecting.

596
00:38:25,269 --> 00:38:26,327
Come on.

597
00:38:26,404 --> 00:38:28,770
Now let this be a warning
to all you moonshiners out there.

598
00:38:28,839 --> 00:38:32,104
My deputies will find you,
they'll smoke you out of your holes,

599
00:38:32,176 --> 00:38:34,303
and they'll send you back to hell.

600
00:38:39,016 --> 00:38:40,506
I ain't done yet!

601
00:38:41,786 --> 00:38:46,086
Earlier today I declared Hazzard
a dry county, and anyone

602
00:38:46,691 --> 00:38:49,159
<i>who uncovers a moonshine operation</i>

603
00:38:49,226 --> 00:38:53,959
will collect a handsome $25,000 reward.

604
00:38:56,467 --> 00:38:57,559
<i>Okay.</i>

605
00:38:57,768 --> 00:38:59,463
Now to show my level of commitment,

606
00:38:59,537 --> 00:39:03,200
I'm turning my own Boar's Nest
into an ice cream parlor.

607
00:39:03,274 --> 00:39:04,673
Yummy, huh?

608
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:08,635
That's good eating, right there.

609
00:39:09,647 --> 00:39:12,912
Let this be known, that together

610
00:39:13,317 --> 00:39:16,309
we can all live high on the Hogg.

611
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:21,924
How do you like my Hoggettes?

612
00:39:23,394 --> 00:39:24,486
Thank you.

613
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:32,726
I can't believe
that Boss declared war on us.

614
00:39:33,003 --> 00:39:34,903
- You worried?
- Please.

615
00:39:35,005 --> 00:39:37,838
The General Lee comes equipped
with a gas pedal and my foot.

616
00:39:37,908 --> 00:39:40,706
We got the fastest car in 37 counties.

617
00:39:40,778 --> 00:39:43,508
- Well, well, well.
- Afternoon, Rosco.

618
00:39:43,581 --> 00:39:46,448
We just saw you on TV.
You know, you make a convincing sheriff.

619
00:39:46,517 --> 00:39:48,144
You really do. Hey, Flash.

620
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:50,881
Don't you touch Flash, you deviant. Hey!

621
00:39:50,955 --> 00:39:53,515
You know I got
a couple of shine-swilling weasels

622
00:39:53,591 --> 00:39:56,856
in the back of my squad car,
and they're starting to smell like ass.

623
00:39:56,927 --> 00:39:58,690
Where is that shine-selling uncle of yours?

624
00:39:58,763 --> 00:40:01,027
You know, you're much better-looking
in person?

625
00:40:01,098 --> 00:40:03,828
Delicate. TV hides
how pretty you really are.

626
00:40:04,568 --> 00:40:08,334
Now, I didn't come over here
to have you tell me how pretty I am.

627
00:40:08,706 --> 00:40:11,004
I know how pretty I am.

628
00:40:11,809 --> 00:40:14,539
Now you open up the General Lee
and let me see that contraband.

629
00:40:14,612 --> 00:40:15,977
Come on, move.

630
00:40:16,547 --> 00:40:18,538
That's why they call me the rattlesnake,
boy.

631
00:40:18,616 --> 00:40:21,813
- 'Cause when I sense trouble, I strike.
...contraband, Rosco.

632
00:40:21,886 --> 00:40:24,787
<i>Figures old Rosco'd leave the keys
right on the seat.</i>

633
00:40:24,855 --> 00:40:25,844
Go, go, go.

634
00:40:25,923 --> 00:40:28,585
<i>He's dumb as a screen door
on a submarine.</i>

635
00:40:28,659 --> 00:40:31,184
That's a real fancy car you got here,
Rosco.

636
00:40:31,562 --> 00:40:34,030
Almost make you seem like a real sheriff.

637
00:40:34,131 --> 00:40:35,962
Well, thank you for... Wait a minute.

638
00:40:36,033 --> 00:40:40,766
I am the real sheriff here.
I won 46.7%/º of the vote.

639
00:40:40,871 --> 00:40:43,897
- Who did you run against?
- Well, I ran unopposed,

640
00:40:43,974 --> 00:40:46,408
'cause no one was man enough
to run against me.

641
00:40:46,477 --> 00:40:49,446
Now you get this rig popped open
real quick-like,

642
00:40:49,513 --> 00:40:52,004
like a little tiny Chinese toy box... Hey!

643
00:40:52,082 --> 00:40:55,108
They gave you a real gun, Rosco.
That is awesome. That is great.

644
00:40:55,186 --> 00:40:57,347
Hey, don't you touch that.
That's standard issue.

645
00:40:57,421 --> 00:41:00,322
Don't touch my puppy. Don't touch her.

646
00:41:00,391 --> 00:41:04,691
- Hey, my bullets! What...
- Oh, now look what I've done.

647
00:41:05,262 --> 00:41:06,490
- Hey, there.
- Here you go.

648
00:41:06,564 --> 00:41:07,861
Don't rub it on your leg like that.

649
00:41:07,932 --> 00:41:11,095
We got chores to do, Rosco.
It ain't easy being a simple farmer.

650
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:14,660
No, no, this is an unacceptable...
Give me that moonshine.

651
00:41:14,738 --> 00:41:17,571
Yeah, I got to get that door fixed, Rosco.
Sorry about that.

652
00:41:17,641 --> 00:41:19,768
- See you next time.
- I know there's shine in here.

653
00:41:19,844 --> 00:41:22,335
- Hey!
- Oh, wait, Rosco.

654
00:41:22,413 --> 00:41:25,177
Maybe next time you can chase us
like a real cop.

655
00:41:25,249 --> 00:41:27,774
You let them go, little Flash honey.

656
00:41:29,653 --> 00:41:33,453
Don't you burn rubber on me!
I know where you live!

657
00:41:35,259 --> 00:41:37,659
Hey! Hey, now...

658
00:41:39,597 --> 00:41:42,589
Hey, this is Rosco.
We got some shiners on the run.

659
00:41:45,402 --> 00:41:48,769
Looks like y'all were right, boys.
They're locking up people.

660
00:41:49,373 --> 00:41:51,841
J.D. Had Rosco run off all our customers.

661
00:41:52,910 --> 00:41:54,775
Ain't right, them scaring people.

662
00:41:54,845 --> 00:41:56,210
Well, this is getting way too dangerous.

663
00:41:56,280 --> 00:42:00,216
- That could be y'all in jail, or even worse.
- Don't say it, Uncle Jesse.

664
00:42:00,284 --> 00:42:03,151
I'm not about to send y'all home
to your folks in wooden boxes,

665
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:06,053
and this farm ain't worth saving
if we got to lose you boys.

666
00:42:06,123 --> 00:42:09,251
- There's got to be something we can do.
- Maybe there is.

667
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:12,355
I got a couple of suits at home
that might fit y'all.

668
00:42:12,429 --> 00:42:16,923
What do you say we pay old J.D. A visit?
It might be time to call a truce.

669
00:42:30,514 --> 00:42:33,950
Oh, my gosh. You boys look like
you just fell off a wedding cake.

670
00:42:34,018 --> 00:42:36,418
Thanks, Daisy. What're you doing?

671
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:39,120
Hughie ain't rejecting me again.

672
00:42:50,701 --> 00:42:52,498
Hot enough for you, Hughie?

673
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:42,378
What's the point? I should be a nun.

674
00:43:42,586 --> 00:43:45,316
<i>Doesn't Daisy look mighty discouraged?</i>

675
00:43:45,389 --> 00:43:47,448
<i>But some lessons
you got to learn by yourself.</i>

676
00:43:47,524 --> 00:43:50,152
<i>You leave a spark alone
you might just find yourself</i>

677
00:43:50,227 --> 00:43:52,320
<i>in the middle of a raging inferno.</i>

678
00:44:01,605 --> 00:44:05,507
<i>So while one Duke is on a quest
to find her inner hotness,</i>

679
00:44:05,576 --> 00:44:07,669
<i>the other Dukes are about to get
all hot and bothered</i>

680
00:44:07,745 --> 00:44:12,307
<i>by a first-class culinary experience
care of Mrs. Lulu Hogg.</i>

681
00:44:12,383 --> 00:44:14,874
So, you boys ever roasted a turkey before?

682
00:44:15,252 --> 00:44:18,653
- No, Miss Hogg.
- Oh, please, call me Lulu.

683
00:44:20,057 --> 00:44:24,016
It's Arabic for pearl.
You know where to find a pearl?

684
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:28,298
Open a clam, spread the fleshy pink meat
with your fingers,

685
00:44:28,365 --> 00:44:30,356
and find something beautiful.

686
00:44:31,068 --> 00:44:34,663
<i>You know it's summer,
'cause this woman's in heat</i>

687
00:44:34,872 --> 00:44:36,567
<i>and insane.</i>

688
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:40,906
You keep this up,
you're gonna get my boys hurt.

689
00:44:40,978 --> 00:44:44,106
Your boys are riding shine,
not a-riding ponies.

690
00:44:44,181 --> 00:44:45,773
Getting hurt's part of the territory.

691
00:44:46,650 --> 00:44:48,675
Now we pat her dry, boys.

692
00:44:48,752 --> 00:44:53,951
Not that she don't enjoy being wet,
but she likes to have her bottom patted.

693
00:44:56,126 --> 00:44:57,718
There. Come on, Luke.

694
00:44:57,828 --> 00:45:00,922
Yeah, go on, Luke. Don't be shy.
You love to cook.

695
00:45:03,333 --> 00:45:05,858
That's Hazzard Mountain over there.
You remember we flipped that car

696
00:45:05,936 --> 00:45:07,801
seven times.
Shook our brains up a little bit,

697
00:45:07,871 --> 00:45:11,307
we still got up and delivered that load
on time, on foot. Remember that?

698
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:13,775
- Ancient history.
- Well, I don't forget things like that.

699
00:45:13,844 --> 00:45:15,937
You done broke the pact
that we used to live by.

700
00:45:16,013 --> 00:45:17,742
You don't hurt a fellow moonshiner.

701
00:45:17,815 --> 00:45:19,783
You broke the pact when you ended
our business arrangement.

702
00:45:19,850 --> 00:45:21,841
Now that you aren't a friend of J.D. Hogg,

703
00:45:21,919 --> 00:45:25,514
you're finding Hazzard to be lonelier
than a chubby kid at space camp.

704
00:45:25,589 --> 00:45:30,151
Now, you wanna stuff her body cavity.

705
00:45:31,729 --> 00:45:32,923
Come on.

706
00:45:34,765 --> 00:45:37,495
Stuff it good. Good.

707
00:45:38,135 --> 00:45:42,265
You try to get deep inside there.
Come on, now. Get on up in there.

708
00:45:42,873 --> 00:45:45,569
- Get it in there, Luke. Come on.
- Come on now.

709
00:45:45,642 --> 00:45:47,906
- Go on in there.
- Come on, Luke. Don't be shy.

710
00:45:47,978 --> 00:45:50,446
- Okay.
- Stick it in there. Come on.

711
00:45:50,681 --> 00:45:52,012
Come on, Luke.

712
00:46:02,726 --> 00:46:06,025
Look, Jesse loses control. Can he recover?

713
00:46:06,096 --> 00:46:09,554
You're gonna let this personal feud
between you and I get out of hand.

714
00:46:09,633 --> 00:46:10,759
You got a dry county,

715
00:46:10,834 --> 00:46:13,462
and you're arresting moonshiners.
These are nice guys.

716
00:46:13,537 --> 00:46:16,062
Your moonshining days are over.
It's time for a new career.

717
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:18,540
How about farming?

718
00:46:18,809 --> 00:46:22,370
Oh, hell, that's right.
You've only got the farm a few more days.

719
00:46:22,479 --> 00:46:26,074
Jesse crashes and burns.
Our condolences to his family.

720
00:46:26,150 --> 00:46:30,985
But the unbeatable, undeniable J.D. Hogg
takes his victory lap,

721
00:46:31,822 --> 00:46:35,952
collects a million dollars
and shags a movie star.

722
00:46:37,628 --> 00:46:40,654
Yeah, you're in a pickle, Jesse.

723
00:46:47,304 --> 00:46:48,771
It's amazing.

724
00:46:49,173 --> 00:46:52,142
You are single and down for anything.

725
00:46:52,876 --> 00:46:55,743
Any girl would love to snatch you up.

726
00:46:55,813 --> 00:46:59,010
He's right.
Now for the most important part.

727
00:46:59,116 --> 00:47:03,280
We baste her with hot juices.
She loves getting basted.

728
00:47:03,854 --> 00:47:05,082
There you go.

729
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:11,691
Oh, God.

730
00:47:13,063 --> 00:47:16,999
Sis, where is Flashy
and his little squeaky toy?

731
00:47:17,067 --> 00:47:19,592
<i>You know,
the one that looks like a bandido?</i>

732
00:47:24,775 --> 00:47:27,209
You fellas wait right here
while I go get my gun.

733
00:47:27,277 --> 00:47:30,872
Dear brother, you are in my home 'cause
your wife tossed you out on your ear.

734
00:47:30,948 --> 00:47:34,406
Now, if you don't want to sleep
at the jail, leave these boys alone.

735
00:47:34,484 --> 00:47:36,384
These hoodlums are trespassing.

736
00:47:36,453 --> 00:47:39,286
As far as I'm concerned, they are innocent

737
00:47:39,356 --> 00:47:41,916
until someone else
is proven more adorable.

738
00:47:43,126 --> 00:47:46,254
Well, I'm gonna nail
you Dukes hard from behind

739
00:47:46,396 --> 00:47:48,330
when you least expect it.

740
00:47:48,398 --> 00:47:49,456
Kinky.

741
00:47:51,635 --> 00:47:53,398
All right, boys, come on,
let's get out of here.

742
00:47:53,470 --> 00:47:55,734
Y'all let me know
if you need any job applications.

743
00:47:55,806 --> 00:47:58,274
I do own a few businesses in town.

744
00:47:58,342 --> 00:48:01,539
You come back any time, Luke.
You'll be my special helper.

745
00:48:01,845 --> 00:48:03,278
Oh, he'll be back.

746
00:48:05,282 --> 00:48:08,740
- When do we bust them, Boss?
- Don't you worry, Rosco.

747
00:48:08,819 --> 00:48:11,185
If I know Jesse,
he ain't done cooking shine

748
00:48:11,255 --> 00:48:14,088
until they plant his corpse
with the spring crops.

749
00:48:16,894 --> 00:48:20,057
I want to show you boys
something that I'm real proud of.

750
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:22,061
We'll take your word for it.

751
00:48:22,699 --> 00:48:26,226
I've been working long and hard
to make this one come out right.

752
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:29,038
Okay, that's disgusting.

753
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:32,732
This is where we hide the Duke still.

754
00:48:35,545 --> 00:48:39,003
<i>Welcome to the place
where dreams are made.</i>

755
00:48:39,283 --> 00:48:41,808
<i>And illegally bottled and sold at a profit.</i>

756
00:48:43,820 --> 00:48:46,789
Luke, I have a feeling
that we are about to see

757
00:48:46,857 --> 00:48:50,122
how the VIPs are treated at this farm.

758
00:48:50,994 --> 00:48:53,827
This old still has been in our family
for over 100 years, boys.

759
00:48:53,897 --> 00:48:56,127
It makes the best shine in the county.

760
00:48:56,199 --> 00:48:58,099
Back during Prohibition,
Great Grandpa Duke

761
00:48:58,168 --> 00:49:00,068
called together a meeting
of all the shiners.

762
00:49:00,137 --> 00:49:02,765
It was his idea to sell a lot at one time
and make enough money

763
00:49:02,839 --> 00:49:04,272
to get through the winter.

764
00:49:04,341 --> 00:49:08,437
- Genius. A flea market for moonshiners.
- Yeah, kind of like a Shine Mart.

765
00:49:08,512 --> 00:49:12,039
Well, this is our last shot, boys. So
we got to make a lot in the next 24 hours.

766
00:49:12,115 --> 00:49:14,811
Let's not waste any time.
Let's go get Daisy.

767
00:49:14,885 --> 00:49:15,874
Wait.

768
00:49:16,753 --> 00:49:19,244
Leave Daisy alone. She's got her heart set
on that job at the Nest,

769
00:49:19,323 --> 00:49:22,588
and I ain't seen her this passionate
since she played the Virgin Mary

770
00:49:22,659 --> 00:49:24,388
at the Christmas pageant.

771
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:33,665
Ain't nothing exciting
ever gonna happen around here again.

772
00:49:37,641 --> 00:49:38,630
Shit!

773
00:49:57,728 --> 00:49:59,525
I want a job here.

774
00:50:00,430 --> 00:50:01,624
Done.

775
00:50:03,133 --> 00:50:05,294
I want you take me out tomorrow night.

776
00:50:05,369 --> 00:50:06,700
Done.

777
00:50:09,539 --> 00:50:11,905
Hey, what's your cell phone number
so I can call you.

778
00:50:11,975 --> 00:50:15,433
Cell phone? Oh, you can reach me by CB.

779
00:50:15,779 --> 00:50:19,545
My handle is Bo Peep.

780
00:50:21,585 --> 00:50:23,519
Y'all have a pleasant evening.

781
00:50:26,223 --> 00:50:28,714
You can put your eyeballs
back in your head.

782
00:50:37,134 --> 00:50:41,901
<i>Shine Mart, where the community comes
for bull rides, booze and breasts.</i>

783
00:50:41,972 --> 00:50:44,463
<i>That's what I call real family values.</i>

784
00:50:44,841 --> 00:50:47,742
<i>Attention, folks.
If you drank Ugly Andy's shine,</i>

785
00:50:47,911 --> 00:50:50,971
<i>you might want to report to the medic's
tent 'cause you got two minutes to live.</i>

786
00:50:51,048 --> 00:50:53,346
<i>But tonight's not all about fun.</i>

787
00:50:53,417 --> 00:50:56,181
<i>This is the Dukes'last shot
at saving the farm.</i>

788
00:50:56,253 --> 00:50:58,813
Nice bouquet. Slightly fruity.

789
00:50:58,889 --> 00:51:01,483
Burns your balls off. Makes you blind.

790
00:51:01,558 --> 00:51:03,219
I'll take six cases.

791
00:51:18,308 --> 00:51:20,242
Hey, it's Uncle Jesse!

792
00:51:22,012 --> 00:51:23,604
Yeah, Uncle Jesse!

793
00:51:46,937 --> 00:51:50,304
- Cooter!
- Hey, Candy Corn

794
00:51:50,407 --> 00:51:54,207
and Licorice Stick. Nicknames.
Use them or lose them. Your choice.

795
00:51:55,112 --> 00:51:56,272
Oh, hang on.

796
00:51:57,848 --> 00:52:00,043
She's going to pick a dance partner.

797
00:52:00,584 --> 00:52:02,745
Pick me! Cooter can dance!

798
00:52:03,353 --> 00:52:05,116
Right here! Got my hand up!

799
00:52:05,188 --> 00:52:08,646
Come on, right here!
I'll make you red hot! I'll get you going!

800
00:52:08,758 --> 00:52:11,249
Come on! Pick me! Pick me! Pick me!

801
00:52:11,328 --> 00:52:14,354
- Have you seen enough?
- I think so.

802
00:52:15,499 --> 00:52:16,659
Come on.

803
00:52:16,733 --> 00:52:20,726
<i>Folks, there's a pickup truck,
license plate, Shiner Sixty-Niner.</i>

804
00:52:20,837 --> 00:52:22,304
<i>Your lights are on.</i>

805
00:52:24,808 --> 00:52:25,797
Red hot!

806
00:52:49,866 --> 00:52:51,993
You got somebody you want to call?

807
00:52:53,470 --> 00:52:56,439
Well, if you weren't right here, I'd call you.

808
00:52:57,474 --> 00:52:59,908
But since you're right here...

809
00:53:08,118 --> 00:53:09,642
You wanna go inside?

810
00:53:16,593 --> 00:53:20,927
All I want is one taste
of that sweet, fiery nectar.

811
00:53:21,164 --> 00:53:23,598
- I know!
- Come here. I wanna tell y'all something.

812
00:53:23,667 --> 00:53:27,865
First Shine Mart we had over here,
Feds come in to bust us,

813
00:53:28,104 --> 00:53:31,665
but they couldn't find no evidence.
Me and Grandpa Duke drank it all up.

814
00:53:31,741 --> 00:53:35,677
I was blind for four days.
I couldn't see a goddamn thing.

815
00:53:35,745 --> 00:53:37,406
I didn't have no hands,
I didn't have no legs.

816
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:39,107
Just kind of floated around for a while.

817
00:53:39,182 --> 00:53:40,809
Said they found me the next morning,

818
00:53:40,884 --> 00:53:43,785
I was bumping a six-row cultivator
all night long.

819
00:53:45,288 --> 00:53:47,586
So why can't we drink shine?

820
00:53:48,191 --> 00:53:51,718
Your folks don't want y'all drinking shine.
You can't handle it.

821
00:53:51,828 --> 00:53:54,763
A couple of little cuties there that might
want to go for a roll in the hay.

822
00:53:54,831 --> 00:53:57,163
You got my permission
to do that if you want to.

823
00:53:57,234 --> 00:53:59,225
And Duke 'em one time for Uncle Jesse.

824
00:53:59,302 --> 00:54:01,998
- You got it, Uncle Jesse.
- Thanks, Uncle Jesse.

825
00:54:05,208 --> 00:54:06,436
I'm waiting.

826
00:54:07,744 --> 00:54:10,440
- How long?
- Till marriage.

827
00:54:12,649 --> 00:54:14,640
We have to keep our clothes on.

828
00:54:16,019 --> 00:54:18,146
You mean dry-humping?

829
00:54:19,422 --> 00:54:21,014
In layman's terms...

830
00:54:27,197 --> 00:54:30,689
We need a blueprint, a strategy
to get inside these girls' hearts

831
00:54:30,767 --> 00:54:32,291
and their pants.

832
00:54:33,737 --> 00:54:35,830
There's those cute boys again.

833
00:54:36,139 --> 00:54:39,108
Of course, what about being spontaneous?

834
00:54:39,175 --> 00:54:43,669
Just go up, startle them, terrify them,
say the first thing that comes to our head.

835
00:54:43,747 --> 00:54:45,408
I can't do that.

836
00:54:46,149 --> 00:54:49,880
If I can ask questions
and pretend to listen,

837
00:54:49,953 --> 00:54:53,354
then you can go up to Ali Handy
like a commando with a death wish

838
00:54:53,423 --> 00:54:55,550
on his last mission.

839
00:54:56,760 --> 00:54:57,954
- Yeah.
- Go.

840
00:55:00,897 --> 00:55:03,092
Ali Handy?

841
00:55:03,266 --> 00:55:07,430
Me and you is like nitroglycerin
and diatomaceous earth.

842
00:55:08,138 --> 00:55:10,971
Pure dynamite when combined.

843
00:55:11,608 --> 00:55:15,374
- You care to join me for a bull ride?
- No.

844
00:55:16,146 --> 00:55:17,738
I'll watch.

845
00:55:18,948 --> 00:55:22,509
I bet you're pure sex on a bull.

846
00:55:29,859 --> 00:55:31,520
Oh, to be young again.

847
00:55:33,596 --> 00:55:35,826
I'd like to ask you a few questions.

848
00:55:36,700 --> 00:55:38,600
Ask away, then.

849
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:44,902
What is all this about alternative energy?

850
00:55:45,742 --> 00:55:48,939
And how do you keep your ass so firm?

851
00:55:50,447 --> 00:55:52,074
Want to get comatosed?

852
00:55:54,017 --> 00:55:57,350
So that's what firewater tastes like.
Good stuff.

853
00:56:06,663 --> 00:56:08,494
That was amazing.

854
00:56:09,265 --> 00:56:11,665
We'll have to try that wet sometime.

855
00:56:12,302 --> 00:56:16,534
- You'll have to put a ring on my finger.
- That is incredibly hot.

856
00:56:17,807 --> 00:56:19,331
Let's get drunk.

857
00:56:19,709 --> 00:56:23,543
- I ain't never got drunk before.
- It's a night of firsts, huh?

858
00:56:25,014 --> 00:56:28,506
I heard your uncle makes
the best moonshine in the state.

859
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:32,120
- Where did you hear that?
- It's a small town.

860
00:56:33,289 --> 00:56:36,747
Hey, Daisy, you can trust me.

861
00:56:37,827 --> 00:56:39,522
I'm not like other guys.

862
00:56:41,531 --> 00:56:43,624
You can't tell a soul.

863
00:56:44,801 --> 00:56:46,462
Promise?

864
00:56:49,506 --> 00:56:50,632
Promise.

865
00:56:50,707 --> 00:56:53,870
<i>Something here stinks, and it ain't me.</i>

866
00:57:08,758 --> 00:57:11,921
I'm blind.
The damn shine makes you blind.

867
00:57:12,929 --> 00:57:14,920
They've never been drunk before, huh?

868
00:57:14,998 --> 00:57:17,831
Like all boys,
they've never been a lot of things.

869
00:57:18,134 --> 00:57:21,501
Sophisticated, graceful or...

870
00:57:23,173 --> 00:57:25,300
You'll wake the stars.

871
00:57:26,176 --> 00:57:29,043
They're real pretty stars.
Makes me wanna cry.

872
00:57:29,179 --> 00:57:31,147
Hey, let's do another shot.

873
00:57:37,387 --> 00:57:40,618
I swear the boys in this town...

874
00:57:40,824 --> 00:57:42,655
- Cops.
- Cops.

875
00:57:54,504 --> 00:57:56,631
Hold it right there, now!

876
00:57:57,507 --> 00:57:59,668
We got a moonshine party, Boss.

877
00:58:00,043 --> 00:58:03,240
All right, everybody!
Hold it! Freeze! Freeze!

878
00:58:03,446 --> 00:58:05,437
Look at them all running.

879
00:58:06,149 --> 00:58:07,582
Wilma...

880
00:58:08,751 --> 00:58:12,278
Shouldn't you be home with the kids?
My, my, my.

881
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:16,220
All right, y'all want the good news
or the bad news first?

882
00:58:16,292 --> 00:58:19,193
Well, the good news is
this heat spell's supposed to lighten up.

883
00:58:19,262 --> 00:58:23,892
The bad news is
you're all going to jail tonight.

884
00:58:24,801 --> 00:58:26,234
- Boss?
- Yeah?

885
00:58:26,436 --> 00:58:29,030
I don't think them Duke boys is here, Boss.

886
00:58:30,006 --> 00:58:32,497
You ain't ruining my special night, Rosco.

887
00:58:32,976 --> 00:58:35,604
Now we'll get them, sooner or later.

888
00:58:36,045 --> 00:58:41,005
But for now, this prom queen
is going to enjoy his special moment.

889
00:58:41,117 --> 00:58:42,345
Excuse me.

890
00:58:45,655 --> 00:58:48,715
'Cause the reason is sitting right here.

891
00:58:49,626 --> 00:58:52,094
What in the world's happened to you, J.D.?

892
00:58:52,161 --> 00:58:54,288
Oh, no, call me "Boss."

893
00:59:00,603 --> 00:59:02,093
Where are the girls?

894
00:59:08,444 --> 00:59:11,140
Damn it. I still have my underwear on.

895
00:59:11,714 --> 00:59:14,547
Man, Shine Mart was awesome last night.

896
00:59:14,851 --> 00:59:17,012
I don't remember anything about it.

897
00:59:18,421 --> 00:59:20,548
Uncle Jesse is going to be pissed.

898
00:59:25,828 --> 00:59:29,161
- Oh, my God!
- I wonder what happened.

899
00:59:29,732 --> 00:59:31,666
We better go find Uncle Jesse.

900
00:59:37,774 --> 00:59:39,537
Look awful nice, girl.

901
00:59:42,011 --> 00:59:44,479
All right, knock it off back there, boys.

902
00:59:47,150 --> 00:59:49,015
I don't know what all the fuss is about.

903
00:59:49,085 --> 00:59:51,280
Well, you're missing 99%/º of your pants.

904
00:59:51,354 --> 00:59:54,323
And the other 1%/º is covering
your magic part.

905
00:59:54,524 --> 00:59:58,426
Well, I like the way they make me feel.
Hughie likes them.

906
00:59:58,494 --> 00:59:59,927
Of course he does.

907
01:00:00,063 --> 01:00:02,930
- Uncle Jesse.
- Easy there, Twiggy.

908
01:00:03,366 --> 01:00:07,632
Now, you will keep your hands off
the zoo critters. Hmm?

909
01:00:07,937 --> 01:00:12,203
Now you got five minutes to do
what youse gots to do.

910
01:00:14,577 --> 01:00:16,204
We're sorry, Uncle Jesse.

911
01:00:16,279 --> 01:00:18,144
We never should have
left you there at Shine Mart.

912
01:00:18,214 --> 01:00:21,775
Then you'd be in jail with me now.
I'm sorry I got y'all into this.

913
01:00:21,851 --> 01:00:24,911
- I was a big fool to do that.
- So how y'all holding up?

914
01:00:24,988 --> 01:00:27,149
Well, these old guys
ain't got no business in here.

915
01:00:27,223 --> 01:00:29,350
They got farms and families at home.

916
01:00:29,425 --> 01:00:30,824
Well, worry no more.

917
01:00:30,893 --> 01:00:34,021
We have got
a foolproof plan to bust you out.

918
01:00:34,797 --> 01:00:39,427
All right, so I'm going to rig this jail
with 500 pounds of military-grade C-4,

919
01:00:39,502 --> 01:00:41,868
blast a hole big enough
for the General to drive through...

920
01:00:41,938 --> 01:00:46,875
Yeah, yeah, I got you. But why don't you
just catch a bus and go back home?

921
01:00:46,943 --> 01:00:49,241
You need to lean on us
like we lean on you.

922
01:00:49,312 --> 01:00:51,507
Never abandon a fellow runner.

923
01:00:53,449 --> 01:00:55,440
I'll tell you what we might do.

924
01:00:56,019 --> 01:00:58,954
J.D. Has got a lot of important papers
over at his house.

925
01:00:59,022 --> 01:01:02,423
And I know he's up to something.
That would be a good place to start.

926
01:01:02,492 --> 01:01:05,222
'Cause once a shiner, always a shiner.

927
01:01:05,294 --> 01:01:07,194
All right. We'll go up there right now.

928
01:01:07,263 --> 01:01:09,128
Be careful. Don't run in there too quick.

929
01:01:09,198 --> 01:01:11,598
- Be smart.
- Be strong.

930
01:01:12,669 --> 01:01:17,902
<i>Now why would an old moonshiner
like J.D. Hogg lock up Uncle Jesse?</i>

931
01:01:17,974 --> 01:01:22,468
<i>That's what the boys are here to find out.
But first they got to distract Lulu.</i>

932
01:01:22,545 --> 01:01:25,639
<i>And that's up to Luke,
and he ain't exactly thrilled.</i>

933
01:01:25,715 --> 01:01:28,650
<i>See, Lulu is only distracted by two things.</i>

934
01:01:28,718 --> 01:01:31,949
<i>Barbecue and hot, succulent boys.</i>

935
01:01:32,021 --> 01:01:34,421
Stop worrying and roll with it.

936
01:01:35,058 --> 01:01:37,253
Trust your instincts.

937
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:40,796
I don't have instincts. I have plans.

938
01:01:41,164 --> 01:01:42,995
At least I used to, until now.

939
01:01:43,066 --> 01:01:45,762
All we got to do
is stall Lulu for 10 minutes,

940
01:01:45,902 --> 01:01:47,233
then we're gone.

941
01:01:47,336 --> 01:01:50,032
I mean, what could happen
in 10 minutes, right?

942
01:01:58,181 --> 01:02:00,615
- Hi, boys.
- Howdy, Lulu.

943
01:02:01,150 --> 01:02:04,278
- You are looking fine today.
- Thank you.

944
01:02:08,458 --> 01:02:10,653
Can I be your

945
01:02:13,196 --> 01:02:17,963
- special helper?
- Oh, yes. Come. Come on.

946
01:02:23,973 --> 01:02:26,942
It was sweet of Bo
to give us some alone time.

947
01:02:27,076 --> 01:02:30,307
Oh, yeah, he's... He's real generous.

948
01:02:33,216 --> 01:02:36,708
You know, you and Boss look real happy.

949
01:02:37,053 --> 01:02:39,851
Our wedding photo. J.D. Neglects me.

950
01:02:40,356 --> 01:02:43,621
He can't help it, though.
That's why we never had any kids.

951
01:02:43,993 --> 01:02:47,156
What... You're telling me
the most powerful man in Hazzard is...

952
01:02:47,230 --> 01:02:48,356
Yup.

953
01:02:49,665 --> 01:02:53,624
His testicles shut down the sperm bank
and sent all the workers to China.

954
01:02:53,970 --> 01:02:57,997
Now, mind if I slip into something more...

955
01:02:59,275 --> 01:03:00,742
Comfortable?

956
01:03:01,310 --> 01:03:05,542
I was gonna say boner-inducing, but
comfortable is a polite way of putting it.

957
01:03:09,919 --> 01:03:14,879
<i>While Luke's learning the fine art of
seducing the mentally deranged upstairs,</i>

958
01:03:14,991 --> 01:03:17,687
<i>Bo's searching for evidence downstairs.</i>

959
01:03:19,996 --> 01:03:21,691
This is for Uncle Jesse.

960
01:03:21,898 --> 01:03:24,628
I can do this, man. This is for Uncle Jesse.

961
01:03:24,700 --> 01:03:26,725
Yeah, for Uncle Jesse.

962
01:03:30,540 --> 01:03:33,031
<i>Come to mamacita. Come on.</i>

963
01:03:42,418 --> 01:03:43,544
Yeah?

964
01:03:44,353 --> 01:03:47,880
Luke, is this your first time?

965
01:03:48,524 --> 01:03:51,584
First time?
Oh, I've slept with a thousand women.

966
01:03:51,661 --> 01:03:53,424
- Oh, yeah?
- Of all kinds, too.

967
01:03:53,496 --> 01:03:55,862
Sometimes I feel like I work for the UN.

968
01:03:55,932 --> 01:03:58,162
And I've done every position.

969
01:03:59,035 --> 01:04:01,003
I've even invented a few myself.

970
01:04:05,875 --> 01:04:07,502
Boss, you fiend.

971
01:04:09,011 --> 01:04:11,206
First time? That's funny.

972
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:14,113
Well, honey, you're more fidgety
than a queer rooster

973
01:04:14,183 --> 01:04:16,481
in an undersexed henhouse, huh?

974
01:04:16,552 --> 01:04:19,020
Look, if you wanna take a breather
and go downstairs,

975
01:04:19,088 --> 01:04:20,146
we can go get Bo.

976
01:04:20,223 --> 01:04:22,282
No, no! I want you now.

977
01:04:22,358 --> 01:04:24,087
Oh, oh, Luke.

978
01:04:25,728 --> 01:04:27,286
<i>Looks like J.D. 's serious</i>

979
01:04:27,363 --> 01:04:30,298
<i>about replacing beers with milkshakes.</i>

980
01:04:30,366 --> 01:04:32,994
<i>Then again,
things ain't always what they seem.</i>

981
01:04:33,069 --> 01:04:35,230
<i>That's the golden rule in Hazzard.</i>

982
01:04:45,548 --> 01:04:46,640
You shut the door one more time,

983
01:04:46,716 --> 01:04:50,311
I'll marinate you, grill you
and eat your ass for supper. Goodbye!

984
01:04:52,255 --> 01:04:53,779
Luke.

985
01:04:53,856 --> 01:04:54,948
Luke!

986
01:04:55,157 --> 01:04:56,647
<i>You are going to die!</i>

987
01:04:56,726 --> 01:04:57,988
<i>Luke, come in!</i>

988
01:04:58,127 --> 01:05:03,030
Lulu, my steamed dumpling!
Big Daddy Trouble's home!

989
01:05:04,367 --> 01:05:08,133
Damn! What's going on?
Oh, you Duke boys are in trouble now!

990
01:05:09,472 --> 01:05:10,734
<i>Pull out!</i>

991
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:12,702
Pull out!

992
01:05:14,010 --> 01:05:16,035
Big Daddy Trouble's coming, Lulu!

993
01:05:16,112 --> 01:05:19,172
- Oh, Big Daddy Trouble, save me, save me!
- Now, Big Daddy Trouble,

994
01:05:19,248 --> 01:05:20,943
I was just paying Miss Hogg here
a friendly visit.

995
01:05:21,017 --> 01:05:24,453
Oh, you're gonna pay a friendly visit
to the emergency room.

996
01:05:26,489 --> 01:05:27,786
Oh, my...

997
01:05:28,724 --> 01:05:30,351
Come on, Luke!

998
01:05:31,260 --> 01:05:33,387
Come back and see me again!

999
01:05:34,397 --> 01:05:36,365
Rosco, I'm being invaded by Dukes!

1000
01:05:41,971 --> 01:05:44,303
You messing with me, boys, huh?

1001
01:05:46,442 --> 01:05:48,342
Take that for coming after with my wife!

1002
01:05:48,411 --> 01:05:49,776
Luke!

1003
01:05:50,012 --> 01:05:51,070
I'm coming, Boss.

1004
01:05:51,147 --> 01:05:52,478
Good, Rosco, quick!

1005
01:05:52,548 --> 01:05:55,244
Get after them, them Duke boys.
You won't believe what happened!

1006
01:05:55,318 --> 01:05:57,980
Put the dog down,
take my car, go after them!

1007
01:05:58,521 --> 01:06:02,184
- You were gonna leave me again!
- You forgot to fill the tank again.

1008
01:06:03,592 --> 01:06:05,719
- I'm coming for you boys!
- Oh, man!

1009
01:06:11,267 --> 01:06:12,564
Move over!

1010
01:06:16,605 --> 01:06:17,902
Oh, I'm ready now.

1011
01:06:17,974 --> 01:06:19,202
What is that?

1012
01:06:19,275 --> 01:06:20,799
Shit-shine ball.

1013
01:06:30,753 --> 01:06:31,845
Shit!

1014
01:06:34,657 --> 01:06:37,091
I'm backing, I'm backing, I'm backing!

1015
01:06:37,159 --> 01:06:38,626
Keep your eyes on the road!

1016
01:06:38,694 --> 01:06:40,889
Eyes? Who needs eyes?

1017
01:06:46,002 --> 01:06:47,594
Whoa! "Vote for Boss?"

1018
01:06:50,506 --> 01:06:52,167
Lean to the left! Lean to the left!

1019
01:06:52,241 --> 01:06:53,868
Drive somewhere!

1020
01:06:54,877 --> 01:06:56,344
That was fast!

1021
01:06:56,779 --> 01:06:57,768
Go!

1022
01:06:58,814 --> 01:06:59,940
They're getting...

1023
01:07:00,016 --> 01:07:01,142
Rosco!

1024
01:07:02,752 --> 01:07:04,515
St. Peter, I'm here.

1025
01:07:05,654 --> 01:07:07,554
Rosco! What are you doing?

1026
01:07:07,623 --> 01:07:11,855
They'll be drinking margaritas in Mexico
by the time you finish with your nap!

1027
01:07:12,028 --> 01:07:16,328
Flash had a little puppy meatloaf, Boss.

1028
01:07:16,399 --> 01:07:19,960
That's the sickest thing I've seen today.
Get this thing cleaned up!

1029
01:07:20,036 --> 01:07:23,403
God! Good Lord!

1030
01:07:33,249 --> 01:07:36,218
So, this is awkward.

1031
01:07:37,420 --> 01:07:39,980
This day never happened, all right?

1032
01:07:40,456 --> 01:07:42,481
If someone ask us
what happened on this day,

1033
01:07:42,558 --> 01:07:45,254
we'll say,
"That's the day we went bowling!"

1034
01:07:45,327 --> 01:07:48,558
And not the day that Lulu Hogg rode you
like a Minotaur?

1035
01:07:49,098 --> 01:07:50,429
Exactly.

1036
01:07:50,499 --> 01:07:51,625
Not that day.

1037
01:07:51,700 --> 01:07:53,895
<i>Got your ears on, Lost Sheep?</i>

1038
01:07:56,072 --> 01:07:58,006
Got our ears on and eyes peeled.

1039
01:07:58,074 --> 01:08:00,838
<i>Listen, fellas,
something strange is going on here.</i>

1040
01:08:00,910 --> 01:08:04,004
<i>I saw boxes being delivered
by armed deputies.</i>

1041
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:07,106
<i>Sort of odd in a place
where lemon sorbet is on the menu.</i>

1042
01:08:07,183 --> 01:08:09,447
Hang on, Daisy, we'll be there later.

1043
01:08:10,486 --> 01:08:12,954
First, we gotta dress up for the occasion.

1044
01:08:21,363 --> 01:08:22,523
Rosco.

1045
01:08:23,199 --> 01:08:25,167
You still stink.

1046
01:08:25,234 --> 01:08:28,362
You stink so bad,
your kids' kids are gonna stink,

1047
01:08:28,437 --> 01:08:31,235
if anyone'll procreate with you,
which I doubt.

1048
01:08:31,307 --> 01:08:35,266
Now, come on, Boss,
I did my very, very best.

1049
01:08:35,344 --> 01:08:39,212
Rosco, if I want advice
on letting criminals escape,

1050
01:08:39,281 --> 01:08:40,680
I'll call you.

1051
01:08:40,916 --> 01:08:42,008
Calm down.

1052
01:08:42,084 --> 01:08:47,454
Them Dukes. They assaulted my boar,
they violated the sanctity of my home,

1053
01:08:47,523 --> 01:08:50,151
and they molested
my tender flower of a wife.

1054
01:08:50,226 --> 01:08:52,524
Oh, yeah, Boss, I can picture it now.

1055
01:08:52,595 --> 01:08:56,497
Their greasy little fingers
running all over her hot buttocks

1056
01:08:56,565 --> 01:08:59,693
like a chubby kid looking for chicken wings
in the bottom of a basket.

1057
01:08:59,768 --> 01:09:00,928
Rosco!

1058
01:09:01,737 --> 01:09:05,605
You dummy, I don't wanna
imagine the circumstance.

1059
01:09:06,108 --> 01:09:07,598
I want them in jail!

1060
01:09:08,010 --> 01:09:10,001
Can you do that? Can you just...

1061
01:09:10,079 --> 01:09:13,810
I got enough worries
with my ice cream parlor investors.

1062
01:09:13,883 --> 01:09:15,612
Just add more deputies.

1063
01:09:15,684 --> 01:09:18,016
Do whatever it takes. I can't rest

1064
01:09:18,087 --> 01:09:21,488
until their gonads are scattered
to the four corners of Hazzard.

1065
01:09:22,858 --> 01:09:25,725
<i>Hazzard's a place
where dreams do come true.</i>

1066
01:09:25,794 --> 01:09:28,991
<i>Bo and Luke got famous.
Just the wrong way.</i>

1067
01:09:29,298 --> 01:09:31,095
<i>Enos finally got deputized.</i>

1068
01:09:31,167 --> 01:09:34,568
<i>A hall monitor with a gun. Lord save us.</i>

1069
01:09:36,772 --> 01:09:41,368
<i>With their faces plastered all over town,
the boys figured they needed a makeover.</i>

1070
01:09:41,544 --> 01:09:44,012
Why the hell do I have to wear the skirt?

1071
01:09:44,313 --> 01:09:46,838
Because you have nicer legs.

1072
01:09:46,916 --> 01:09:47,940
Thank you.

1073
01:09:48,017 --> 01:09:51,885
<i>No way to sugarcoat it,
they make damn fine-Iooking women.</i>

1074
01:09:51,954 --> 01:09:54,081
Get over and talk to them right now,
you hear me, boy?

1075
01:09:54,156 --> 01:09:55,248
All right.

1076
01:09:55,491 --> 01:09:56,856
Excuse me.

1077
01:09:58,194 --> 01:10:00,594
You ladies don't look
like you're from around here.

1078
01:10:00,663 --> 01:10:02,324
- Can I help?
- Yes...

1079
01:10:03,532 --> 01:10:06,000
I'm Detective Amanda Smith

1080
01:10:06,068 --> 01:10:09,333
and this is my partner, Anita Davington.

1081
01:10:10,039 --> 01:10:12,906
We're with the Federal Bureau
of Frozen Delights,

1082
01:10:12,975 --> 01:10:15,671
and we are conducting an investigation.

1083
01:10:15,744 --> 01:10:17,268
Federal agents?

1084
01:10:18,614 --> 01:10:20,411
I'm Deputy Enos Strate.

1085
01:10:20,482 --> 01:10:23,679
You know, you ought to talk to Daisy.

1086
01:10:24,620 --> 01:10:25,985
She's real nice.

1087
01:10:26,555 --> 01:10:28,284
Here she comes now.

1088
01:10:30,292 --> 01:10:33,921
If you need any further assistance,
just give me a holler.

1089
01:10:38,167 --> 01:10:40,965
Here's the key to Boss Hogg's office.

1090
01:10:42,271 --> 01:10:45,104
Now, hold on there one minute, little lady.

1091
01:10:45,874 --> 01:10:50,675
Failure to dance with the sheriff
is a crime here in Hazzard County,

1092
01:10:50,746 --> 01:10:54,978
punishable by 10 years
in a maximum-security prison.

1093
01:10:56,018 --> 01:10:59,078
Now, my ex, she chucked
this old poon hound to the curb

1094
01:10:59,154 --> 01:11:02,783
like a perp charged on indecent exposure,

1095
01:11:02,858 --> 01:11:07,022
failure to communicate,
and wagon wheels on a wing nut.

1096
01:11:10,599 --> 01:11:14,365
She thinks upholding the law
is the only thing I care about.

1097
01:11:15,104 --> 01:11:18,938
But I do have my other passions.

1098
01:11:21,877 --> 01:11:23,606
Don't get fresh, Sheriff.

1099
01:11:24,980 --> 01:11:26,004
Oh, my.

1100
01:11:27,216 --> 01:11:30,151
You have a grip like an anaconda.

1101
01:11:31,153 --> 01:11:33,781
I bet you could swallow me whole, too.

1102
01:11:42,665 --> 01:11:44,064
Come on, let's go.

1103
01:11:45,434 --> 01:11:46,833
<i>The boys' wigs got them in.</i>

1104
01:11:46,902 --> 01:11:50,770
<i>But it was time to leave
the distracting work to a professional.</i>

1105
01:11:50,839 --> 01:11:55,105
<i>You ain't never gonna look at a sundae
the same way again.</i>

1106
01:11:55,311 --> 01:11:56,437
Oh, baby.

1107
01:11:56,512 --> 01:11:57,570
Oh, my.

1108
01:12:01,283 --> 01:12:03,183
Yeah, that's cold, all right.

1109
01:12:04,286 --> 01:12:05,753
Cool me down.

1110
01:12:19,702 --> 01:12:20,896
Sweet.

1111
01:12:25,407 --> 01:12:27,671
Rosco shouldn't treat a lady like that.

1112
01:12:27,743 --> 01:12:31,406
- Now you're a lady?
- No, but I should be treated like one.

1113
01:12:31,480 --> 01:12:33,345
Oh, man, these hose are killing me.

1114
01:12:38,687 --> 01:12:40,211
Man, that's hot.

1115
01:13:02,578 --> 01:13:04,273
Hey, look, look at that.

1116
01:13:12,421 --> 01:13:14,048
Well, how's it coming with the investors?

1117
01:13:14,123 --> 01:13:16,182
It's just a matter of time
before the other commissioners

1118
01:13:16,258 --> 01:13:17,748
turn the whole state dry.

1119
01:13:17,826 --> 01:13:20,920
No one resists the Hogg, John,
including Daisy Duke.

1120
01:13:21,463 --> 01:13:23,556
It was a lot more fun
finding out about their still

1121
01:13:23,632 --> 01:13:26,863
from that hot piece of tail
than those hillbillies, Bo and Luke.

1122
01:13:26,935 --> 01:13:30,371
In less than 24 hours,
we are foreclosing on that Duke farm

1123
01:13:30,439 --> 01:13:32,066
and take that still.

1124
01:13:32,141 --> 01:13:34,769
Then you'll add your premium shine.

1125
01:13:34,843 --> 01:13:37,971
You know, before you go
on your rounds in the morning,

1126
01:13:38,046 --> 01:13:41,573
stop by the Boar's Nest.
I got a present for my favorite nephew.

1127
01:13:41,884 --> 01:13:43,249
Hughie's a Hogg.

1128
01:13:48,056 --> 01:13:50,047
- Daisy.
- Oh, Daisy.

1129
01:13:50,125 --> 01:13:51,251
Daisy, wait!

1130
01:13:54,430 --> 01:13:57,228
- I can't believe what a jerk he is!
- Daisy, wait!

1131
01:13:58,066 --> 01:13:59,897
I know you wanna wrap your thighs
around his chest

1132
01:13:59,968 --> 01:14:01,060
and squeeze the air out of him,

1133
01:14:01,136 --> 01:14:02,433
so do I.

1134
01:14:02,504 --> 01:14:04,404
But we cannot let him know
we're on to him.

1135
01:14:04,473 --> 01:14:07,533
We gotta follow Hughie
and see where he takes us, okay?

1136
01:14:08,510 --> 01:14:10,774
- I'll kill him with my bare hands!
- No, Daisy!

1137
01:14:10,846 --> 01:14:13,337
You'll get your chance with Hughie.

1138
01:14:13,482 --> 01:14:17,441
Right now,
we gotta think about Uncle Jesse.

1139
01:14:20,889 --> 01:14:22,356
Sorry, Daisy.

1140
01:14:23,125 --> 01:14:26,322
They have messed with me
at the wrong time of the month.

1141
01:14:27,696 --> 01:14:29,391
<i>Here's what we know so far.</i>

1142
01:14:29,465 --> 01:14:32,992
<i>Hughie's a no-good, two-faced Hogg
and Boss is still in the shine business.</i>

1143
01:14:33,068 --> 01:14:35,093
<i>With everybody locked up
and the state going dry,</i>

1144
01:14:35,170 --> 01:14:37,604
<i>there'll be one place in town
to get good and hammered,</i>

1145
01:14:37,673 --> 01:14:39,698
<i>the Boar's Nest ice cream parlor.</i>

1146
01:14:39,775 --> 01:14:42,801
<i>Hogg will make a killing, but Bo and Luke
are hoping handsome Hughie</i>

1147
01:14:42,878 --> 01:14:45,972
<i>will lead them right to Boss's shine stash
so they can stop him.</i>

1148
01:14:46,048 --> 01:14:47,515
<i>Do you follow?</i>

1149
01:14:47,583 --> 01:14:50,279
<i>I never said this was going to be easy.</i>

1150
01:14:53,422 --> 01:14:55,549
We'll lose him if he gets too far ahead!

1151
01:14:55,624 --> 01:14:56,818
I can't get too close.

1152
01:14:56,892 --> 01:14:59,087
Driving's second nature to me, Luke.

1153
01:15:00,162 --> 01:15:02,995
Orange car. Smart pick, boys, smart pick.

1154
01:15:11,039 --> 01:15:13,371
- What the hell?
- I can't see anything.

1155
01:15:13,442 --> 01:15:15,433
Hughie is burning some dust.

1156
01:15:20,949 --> 01:15:23,850
I can feel the road. Snake coming.

1157
01:15:23,919 --> 01:15:25,546
You can feel the road?

1158
01:15:25,621 --> 01:15:27,589
Oh! Damn it, Bo, be careful!

1159
01:15:27,656 --> 01:15:29,419
I got it! I got it!

1160
01:15:35,430 --> 01:15:37,489
- Oh, shit!
- Shit!

1161
01:15:47,075 --> 01:15:48,303
Oh, man!

1162
01:15:50,846 --> 01:15:54,145
Beautiful driving.
You know, you come a long way.

1163
01:15:54,216 --> 01:15:55,945
Your instincts are worthless.

1164
01:15:56,018 --> 01:15:58,612
- I thought I had him.
- Oh, you lost him.

1165
01:15:58,687 --> 01:16:01,884
You lost our best chance of nailing Boss
and getting Uncle Jesse out.

1166
01:16:01,957 --> 01:16:06,291
Plan all you want, but somebody's gotta
actually drive and do something.

1167
01:16:06,929 --> 01:16:11,263
So you're the smart one, congrats.
What'd that get us, huh?

1168
01:16:11,333 --> 01:16:14,359
You know I should have left you
at the farm that first night.

1169
01:16:14,436 --> 01:16:16,836
Now I'm stuck here with an idiot.

1170
01:16:18,473 --> 01:16:19,497
I'm gone.

1171
01:16:22,110 --> 01:16:23,907
That's what you're good at.

1172
01:16:24,012 --> 01:16:25,604
Leaving people behind.

1173
01:16:26,114 --> 01:16:28,639
Go! No one's gonna miss you.

1174
01:16:30,619 --> 01:16:32,746
Now maybe I can finally get laid.

1175
01:16:35,190 --> 01:16:36,521
<i>You know something ain't right</i>

1176
01:16:36,592 --> 01:16:39,527
<i>when Bo kicks
the thing he loves most in the world.</i>

1177
01:16:39,595 --> 01:16:43,929
<i>In fact, I'd say there ain't a whole lot
that is right in Hazzard at the moment.</i>

1178
01:16:46,735 --> 01:16:48,225
<i>Poor Uncle Jesse,</i>

1179
01:16:48,303 --> 01:16:52,137
<i>just sitting in the clink
wishing he was on the farm he loves.</i>

1180
01:16:53,375 --> 01:16:55,935
<i>Poor hot, juicy Daisy.</i>

1181
01:16:56,011 --> 01:16:58,411
<i>First, Hughie foreclosed on her heart,</i>

1182
01:16:58,480 --> 01:17:00,846
<i>then Rosco foreclosed on the farm.</i>

1183
01:17:17,399 --> 01:17:22,234
<i>And so, things didn't turn out
exactly like we hoped for the Dukes.</i>

1184
01:17:23,071 --> 01:17:25,471
<i>Ain't that the way life is sometimes?</i>

1185
01:17:25,807 --> 01:17:27,900
Thanks! Thanks a lot!

1186
01:17:35,951 --> 01:17:38,715
Oh, I got it. I got it, Bo!

1187
01:18:40,015 --> 01:18:42,006
I can't follow you, Luke.

1188
01:18:42,684 --> 01:18:44,652
I can't cross that line.

1189
01:18:46,722 --> 01:18:48,280
I love Hazzard.

1190
01:18:48,857 --> 01:18:51,121
I love my hair in the Hazzard sun.

1191
01:18:51,193 --> 01:18:54,060
I love Daisy and Uncle Jesse.

1192
01:18:54,129 --> 01:18:56,996
I love the smell of pig shit in the morning.

1193
01:18:57,566 --> 01:19:01,161
I love the feel of the General Lee's hood
on my tight, toned butt.

1194
01:19:03,572 --> 01:19:06,063
Let's forget that all happened, all right?

1195
01:19:07,309 --> 01:19:10,210
Heat of the moment.
It'll never happen again.

1196
01:19:14,249 --> 01:19:16,479
- That truck wasn't cold.
- What truck?

1197
01:19:16,551 --> 01:19:20,954
A Hogg ice cream truck just drove by.
I hit it with my hand and it was warm.

1198
01:19:21,056 --> 01:19:24,856
It's kind of hard to keep ice cream cold
with a truck with no freezer.

1199
01:19:27,062 --> 01:19:30,429
Okay, I really am the good-looking one.
Explain.

1200
01:19:30,499 --> 01:19:34,560
Hogg's using the truck to transport shine.
It's a cover.

1201
01:19:34,636 --> 01:19:36,900
And I bet I know
where he's keeping that shine.

1202
01:19:36,972 --> 01:19:39,736
Hogg's Ravine, the ice cream factory!

1203
01:19:42,611 --> 01:19:44,841
Come on. Let's go find Daisy and Cooter.

1204
01:19:46,281 --> 01:19:48,613
The farm belongs to Boss at noon.

1205
01:19:48,683 --> 01:19:50,947
That doesn't give us much time.

1206
01:19:51,019 --> 01:19:55,319
- I'm so stupid for falling for Hughie.
- You're not stupid, Daisy.

1207
01:19:55,390 --> 01:19:57,858
You're the smartest person I know.

1208
01:19:58,627 --> 01:20:00,527
He made me feel pretty.

1209
01:20:00,862 --> 01:20:04,491
You don't need some big city jackass
to tell you you're pretty.

1210
01:20:04,566 --> 01:20:05,590
Yeah.

1211
01:20:05,667 --> 01:20:08,158
Hell, Luke and I wanted
to get nasty with you several times

1212
01:20:08,236 --> 01:20:10,704
till we realized you were our cousin.

1213
01:20:11,072 --> 01:20:13,563
Actually, that didn't even matter to Luke.

1214
01:20:15,010 --> 01:20:16,409
It's true.

1215
01:20:17,078 --> 01:20:18,568
Thanks, boys.

1216
01:20:19,347 --> 01:20:21,315
So what are we gonna do?

1217
01:20:21,383 --> 01:20:24,841
We are gonna get Boss to pay for the farm
out of his own pocket.

1218
01:20:24,920 --> 01:20:26,945
And why would he do that?

1219
01:20:27,923 --> 01:20:31,120
<i>Nothing prettier than a good plan
coming together amongst friends.</i>

1220
01:20:31,193 --> 01:20:36,221
<i>I know y'all are anxious to hear about it,
but that'd ruin the surprise.</i>

1221
01:20:36,898 --> 01:20:38,832
Well, it ain't perfect.

1222
01:20:39,601 --> 01:20:41,398
The General's hurt.

1223
01:20:42,637 --> 01:20:45,538
I can't believe I'm gonna let you leave
with the seats all torn.

1224
01:20:45,607 --> 01:20:47,302
It breaks my damn heart.

1225
01:20:47,676 --> 01:20:51,635
And hopefully, she'll last long enough
for us to do what we gotta do.

1226
01:20:52,380 --> 01:20:54,109
Hope's all we got.

1227
01:20:54,649 --> 01:20:56,480
Hope and a prayer.

1228
01:20:57,886 --> 01:20:58,944
And a dream.

1229
01:20:59,020 --> 01:21:01,989
- Hope and a prayer and a dream.
- Okay, we got it, Cooter.

1230
01:21:02,057 --> 01:21:03,752
- Thank you, buddy.
- Okay.

1231
01:21:04,259 --> 01:21:05,624
Be careful.

1232
01:21:08,763 --> 01:21:10,663
<i>Election day in Hazzard,</i>

1233
01:21:10,732 --> 01:21:12,700
<i>where folks are expected to vote early</i>

1234
01:21:12,767 --> 01:21:15,702
<i>and vote often for Jefferson Davis Hogg.</i>

1235
01:21:16,671 --> 01:21:19,640
What a beautiful day for democracy
here in Hazzard.

1236
01:21:21,509 --> 01:21:22,567
<i>Here's part one of the plan.</i>

1237
01:21:22,644 --> 01:21:25,738
<i>Y'all are gonna see what they mean
by beauty and brains.</i>

1238
01:21:25,814 --> 01:21:26,940
Hi, Deputy.

1239
01:21:29,451 --> 01:21:31,612
Anything exciting happening?

1240
01:21:32,120 --> 01:21:35,248
I don't really get to leave the station,
so this is...

1241
01:21:35,323 --> 01:21:39,521
Well, I bet there's a lot
of important police business here.

1242
01:21:40,161 --> 01:21:43,528
- Wanna show me around?
- Oh, yes, please.

1243
01:21:48,169 --> 01:21:51,661
Every voter is going to get a coupon
good for $1.00 off

1244
01:21:51,740 --> 01:21:53,935
at Hogg's Car Wash and Delicatessen.

1245
01:21:55,343 --> 01:21:57,140
Let's get high on the Hogg!

1246
01:21:57,345 --> 01:21:59,745
<i>Part two, Cooter's no philosopher,</i>

1247
01:21:59,814 --> 01:22:02,840
<i>but he can handle a tow truck
with the grace of a figure skater.</i>

1248
01:22:02,918 --> 01:22:04,943
Now all the commissioners here,

1249
01:22:05,020 --> 01:22:08,387
we've gotten together and they've seen
how we're living in Hazzard.

1250
01:22:08,456 --> 01:22:11,323
It's pure, simple, it's good.

1251
01:22:11,893 --> 01:22:14,885
One hand on the Bible,
the other hand on the plow.

1252
01:22:15,664 --> 01:22:21,068
That's why we've all banded together
to turn our glorious state dry.

1253
01:22:21,870 --> 01:22:25,567
Now, this is just the beginning
of a program that I...

1254
01:22:27,242 --> 01:22:31,303
<i>Part three, Bo, Luke and the General Lee.</i>

1255
01:22:31,379 --> 01:22:34,507
<i>The perfect marriage of men and machine.</i>

1256
01:22:35,350 --> 01:22:39,343
Well, if it ain't the Duke boys
come to turn themself in!

1257
01:22:39,421 --> 01:22:40,649
Rosco...

1258
01:22:40,922 --> 01:22:42,082
<i>Now, Cooter.</i>

1259
01:22:43,992 --> 01:22:45,118
What the...

1260
01:22:51,299 --> 01:22:52,732
Oh, boy, are you all right?

1261
01:22:52,801 --> 01:22:54,029
Howdy, Boss.

1262
01:22:54,970 --> 01:22:58,064
Oh, you Dukes are gonna
face the firing squad for this.

1263
01:22:58,139 --> 01:22:59,367
Get in.

1264
01:23:00,842 --> 01:23:02,070
Go, Bo.

1265
01:23:06,381 --> 01:23:07,609
<i>Attention all units.</i>

1266
01:23:07,682 --> 01:23:12,483
<i>Two male suspects driving
a kick-ass orange '69 Charger</i>

1267
01:23:12,554 --> 01:23:15,580
<i>are believed to have kidnapped
Commissioner Hogg.</i>

1268
01:23:15,657 --> 01:23:17,750
<i>All units respond.</i>

1269
01:23:18,526 --> 01:23:20,289
Enjoy the sunny day.

1270
01:23:29,938 --> 01:23:32,338
This here
is the emergency broadcast system.

1271
01:23:32,407 --> 01:23:35,001
In case of emergency, I get on the horn,

1272
01:23:35,076 --> 01:23:38,273
they send me in there,
or I make the call, I mean...

1273
01:23:38,346 --> 01:23:40,507
I ain't never seen one of these before.

1274
01:23:40,582 --> 01:23:43,551
I don't think you should be playing
with that, Daisy.

1275
01:23:44,052 --> 01:23:48,216
- Enos, hand me that screwdriver.
- Yes, ma'am.

1276
01:23:58,666 --> 01:24:00,600
You can slow down any time you want!

1277
01:24:00,668 --> 01:24:02,033
We got no reason to live!

1278
01:24:02,103 --> 01:24:05,129
You've taken the farm from us,
locked up my Uncle Jesse,

1279
01:24:05,206 --> 01:24:06,434
now you got us on the run.

1280
01:24:06,508 --> 01:24:08,942
You plowed my wife's field
you sexual miscreant.

1281
01:24:09,010 --> 01:24:10,136
You should burn at the stake!

1282
01:24:10,211 --> 01:24:12,475
We'd rather be the famous outlaws

1283
01:24:12,547 --> 01:24:14,378
that died in a police chase.

1284
01:24:16,351 --> 01:24:19,252
Unless you tell us
about your shine business!

1285
01:24:19,320 --> 01:24:21,788
That's a good one!
I ain't telling you Dukes a thing!

1286
01:24:21,856 --> 01:24:24,791
It's either jail or the cemetery
for two no-good bums like you.

1287
01:24:24,859 --> 01:24:27,350
Guess we'll take the cemetery, then!

1288
01:24:47,515 --> 01:24:48,641
Yeah!

1289
01:24:51,553 --> 01:24:53,487
Those darn Duke boys.

1290
01:24:54,055 --> 01:24:56,250
It don't get any better than this!

1291
01:25:06,267 --> 01:25:07,859
We got them now!

1292
01:25:11,873 --> 01:25:16,503
This is Rosco P. Coltrane,
and I'm in hot pursuit of them Duke boys.

1293
01:25:22,617 --> 01:25:24,175
He shot us!

1294
01:25:26,921 --> 01:25:28,889
"Protect and serve," my ass!

1295
01:25:31,793 --> 01:25:32,851
Hot damn!

1296
01:25:33,795 --> 01:25:36,559
Get their tires!
Don't shoot me, you stupid...

1297
01:25:36,865 --> 01:25:39,095
Hot damn! I'm alive!

1298
01:25:49,911 --> 01:25:51,378
What are you doing?

1299
01:25:52,814 --> 01:25:54,247
Wait! You ain't gonna do it!

1300
01:25:54,315 --> 01:25:58,308
Boss, you got anything you'd like to say
to your maker, now's a good time.

1301
01:25:59,587 --> 01:26:00,952
You ready, Daisy?

1302
01:26:01,256 --> 01:26:02,951
10-4. Go for it, Luke.

1303
01:26:04,692 --> 01:26:06,057
You're bluffing!

1304
01:26:07,695 --> 01:26:09,219
Don't do it! No!

1305
01:26:14,969 --> 01:26:15,958
What...

1306
01:26:20,575 --> 01:26:22,042
Getting close, Boss.

1307
01:26:26,381 --> 01:26:31,512
Okay! Okay, I...
I locked up your uncle so I could...

1308
01:26:31,653 --> 01:26:34,952
So I could run a monopoly, shine
monopoly out of the Boar's Nest, see?

1309
01:26:35,023 --> 01:26:37,719
<i>- Then I'd watch these normal people...
- He's a pig!</i>

1310
01:26:37,792 --> 01:26:40,090
<i>... spending their hard-earned dollars!</i>

1311
01:26:40,995 --> 01:26:42,223
Decent people

1312
01:26:42,297 --> 01:26:46,256
<i>spending their money there!
Are you happy?</i>

1313
01:26:46,401 --> 01:26:48,596
<i>Are you happy? Is that a crime?</i>

1314
01:26:50,038 --> 01:26:53,371
<i>You boys did it!
Everyone in town heard Boss.</i>

1315
01:26:53,441 --> 01:26:55,841
Why, you dirty, filthy, conniving Dukes!

1316
01:26:56,110 --> 01:26:59,477
Well, it don't matter, though.
You need a little thing called evidence.

1317
01:26:59,547 --> 01:27:01,139
Then we got one more thing to do!

1318
01:27:01,216 --> 01:27:02,843
No you don't! No you don't!

1319
01:27:02,917 --> 01:27:03,906
No!

1320
01:27:05,954 --> 01:27:09,014
<i>They're heading back for the ravine!
They're gonna die!</i>

1321
01:27:09,724 --> 01:27:12,249
Jump that already! Jump it!

1322
01:27:48,696 --> 01:27:49,822
Damn!

1323
01:27:57,038 --> 01:27:59,006
<i>Kind of a nifty plan, huh?</i>

1324
01:27:59,073 --> 01:28:02,531
<i>See, the boys just found
Boss Hogg's shine operation.</i>

1325
01:28:02,610 --> 01:28:04,339
<i>You know what that means.</i>

1326
01:28:05,213 --> 01:28:06,805
Excuse me.

1327
01:28:12,053 --> 01:28:14,248
<i>I hope Boss brought his checkbook.</i>

1328
01:28:16,257 --> 01:28:17,554
Oh, boy.

1329
01:28:21,863 --> 01:28:24,627
<i>Folks were mighty tired
of all the shenanigans.</i>

1330
01:28:24,699 --> 01:28:27,532
<i>So, Boss was forced to let the shiners go.</i>

1331
01:28:27,969 --> 01:28:30,335
Whoa! Hey.

1332
01:28:30,505 --> 01:28:32,370
Well, well, well.

1333
01:28:33,241 --> 01:28:36,972
Looks like little bluebird is ready to fly.

1334
01:28:37,045 --> 01:28:38,945
- Hey.
- Hey!

1335
01:28:39,147 --> 01:28:41,513
It's the boys and the girl. How are you?

1336
01:28:41,649 --> 01:28:44,209
You know, your folks sent y'all down here
to learn to be gentlemen,

1337
01:28:44,285 --> 01:28:46,583
you wind up breaking the law,
running shine

1338
01:28:46,654 --> 01:28:48,986
and doing a damn good job of it, too,
I might add.

1339
01:28:49,057 --> 01:28:51,218
Let's blow this pop stand, come on.

1340
01:28:52,593 --> 01:28:54,424
You good-for-nothing.

1341
01:28:58,633 --> 01:29:00,828
Take it all in, Hughie

1342
01:29:00,902 --> 01:29:04,702
'cause they don't serve anything this fine
in here.

1343
01:29:07,975 --> 01:29:10,170
Oh, wait, wait, wait. No, no.

1344
01:29:10,278 --> 01:29:13,145
Daisy, I'm available for conjugal visits.
Daisy!

1345
01:29:13,948 --> 01:29:16,508
<i>And since someone
needed to take the fall,</i>

1346
01:29:16,584 --> 01:29:20,350
<i>Boss set up Hughie
as his personal Humpty Dumpty.</i>

1347
01:29:34,335 --> 01:29:35,563
On one...

1348
01:29:36,204 --> 01:29:39,367
<i>The voters weren't too happy
when they learned what Hogg was up to.</i>

1349
01:29:39,440 --> 01:29:41,465
<i>So they saw fit to elect a better man.</i>

1350
01:29:41,542 --> 01:29:43,169
<i>An honest man.</i>

1351
01:29:43,244 --> 01:29:45,940
<i>A dead man.</i>

1352
01:29:46,247 --> 01:29:49,546
<i>Turned out the shock of winning
was too much for old man Abernathy.</i>

1353
01:29:49,617 --> 01:29:51,608
<i>May he rest in peace.</i>

1354
01:29:51,753 --> 01:29:56,213
<i>So the voters, in their infinite wisdom,
put Boss back in office,</i>

1355
01:29:56,290 --> 01:29:59,123
<i>figuring the devil you know
is better than the devil you don't.</i>

1356
01:29:59,193 --> 01:30:00,683
Get your hand off of there now.

1357
01:30:00,762 --> 01:30:04,789
<i>His first official act was to pardon himself
of all wrongdoing.</i>

1358
01:30:05,800 --> 01:30:09,429
<i>Boss regretted offering that reward
for uncovering shine.</i>

1359
01:30:09,504 --> 01:30:11,631
<i>He figured nobody'd ever catch on to him.</i>

1360
01:30:11,706 --> 01:30:14,368
<i>Then, again, he never figured
on Bo and Luke.</i>

1361
01:30:14,442 --> 01:30:17,275
<i>They used the reward
to buy back the farm.</i>

1362
01:30:20,815 --> 01:30:25,650
<i>Bo finally found someone who appreciated
his particular driving skills.</i>

1363
01:30:27,388 --> 01:30:29,413
Wait! Did I pass?

1364
01:30:34,896 --> 01:30:36,420
- Yes!
- Yeah!

1365
01:30:38,866 --> 01:30:42,962
<i>While Luke found the one gal impressed
by a fella who can blow shit up.</i>

1366
01:30:49,343 --> 01:30:52,335
<i>Looks like he'll finally lose his virginity,</i>

1367
01:30:53,347 --> 01:30:56,578
<i>and to someone
who doesn't sexually abuse poultry.</i>

1368
01:31:00,455 --> 01:31:03,583
<i>Uncle Jesse told the kids
he was quitting the shine business</i>

1369
01:31:03,658 --> 01:31:06,855
<i>to spend the rest of his days
as a simple farmer.</i>

1370
01:31:07,728 --> 01:31:10,026
<i>They should have known
that didn't smell right.</i>

1371
01:31:10,097 --> 01:31:12,759
<i>Once a shiner, always a shiner.</i>

1372
01:31:12,834 --> 01:31:14,802
Race you to the General!

1373
01:31:16,704 --> 01:31:18,171
Hey, where y'all going?

1374
01:31:18,239 --> 01:31:20,469
- We'll be back!
- Don't wait up!

1375
01:31:22,043 --> 01:31:23,533
<i>You know the moment in your life</i>

1376
01:31:23,611 --> 01:31:27,672
<i>when you realize you're exactly
where you're meant to be?</i>

1377
01:31:27,748 --> 01:31:31,240
<i>Hazzard's a place
where two good old boys with a fast car</i>

1378
01:31:31,319 --> 01:31:34,379
<i>can really make a name for themselves.</i>

1379
01:31:53,307 --> 01:31:55,571
- Floor it, Bo. Floor it!
- Damn!

1380
01:32:00,882 --> 01:32:02,213
All right!

1381
01:32:19,600 --> 01:32:21,761
I don't understand what's going on.

1382
01:32:25,139 --> 01:32:27,937
Those Duke sons of bitches!

1383
01:32:29,043 --> 01:32:30,374
Oh, shit!

1384
01:32:31,579 --> 01:32:34,844
Well, you dirty son of a bitch...

1385
01:32:35,616 --> 01:32:37,550
Cut, cut, cut, cut.

1386
01:32:38,119 --> 01:32:40,849
You two sure are pretty.

1387
01:32:48,429 --> 01:32:50,920
Stop hanging around, you little monkey.

1388
01:32:51,065 --> 01:32:53,465
Fucking around is all I ever care about.

1389
01:32:57,305 --> 01:32:58,772
We didn't wanna hit your dog.

1390
01:32:58,839 --> 01:33:03,867
Was I talking to you there, circle of life,
golden hair, zebra-eating freak?

1391
01:33:04,912 --> 01:33:06,072
Rosco!

1392
01:33:06,147 --> 01:33:07,842
Flash had a little

1393
01:33:09,150 --> 01:33:10,549
chip wiggle, Boss.

1394
01:33:14,689 --> 01:33:17,817
Was I talking to you,
blueberry cobbler ass?

1395
01:33:21,729 --> 01:33:23,720
- Gonads scattered in a...
- Stop.

1396
01:33:24,098 --> 01:33:25,156
Stop it right there.

1397
01:33:25,232 --> 01:33:28,258
I love grease and scattered gonads, Boss.

1398
01:33:31,005 --> 01:33:32,905
Come on! Come here, come here.

1399
01:33:32,974 --> 01:33:35,033
You hide behind those pigtails
and those braces.

1400
01:33:35,109 --> 01:33:37,600
Come on, come on! I can take her!

1401
01:33:37,812 --> 01:33:39,211
You got two weeks,

1402
01:33:39,280 --> 01:33:41,714
then I'm sending Rosco out
to foreclose on the farm.

1403
01:33:41,782 --> 01:33:43,716
And you call yourself a Mason.

1404
01:33:44,652 --> 01:33:45,983
Yes, I do.

1405
01:33:51,025 --> 01:33:54,620
That's the sickest thing I've seen today.
Get this thing cleaned up!

1406
01:33:54,695 --> 01:33:57,255
We cleaning, Boss, we cleaning.

1407
01:33:58,666 --> 01:34:03,103
When you say shine, your eyes go
all buggy like a retarded dragonfly.

1408
01:34:04,905 --> 01:34:08,705
Hey, can I drive, Uncle Jesse?
I just got my learner's permit.

1409
01:34:12,546 --> 01:34:14,446
Looks like you got
a little more learning to do.

1410
01:34:14,515 --> 01:34:16,574
Besides that, that ain't my car.

1411
01:34:18,519 --> 01:34:24,048
God, you don't have to push me around
like a dirty, fat kid...

1412
01:34:25,026 --> 01:34:26,926
That's a scary-ass pig.

1413
01:34:27,995 --> 01:34:30,463
It's really funny
until you have your hand chewed off.

1414
01:34:30,531 --> 01:34:32,192
All right, this is just for the outtakes.

1415
01:34:32,266 --> 01:34:33,494
The cemetery.

1416
01:34:33,567 --> 01:34:36,593
You might wanna try some of that mouth
to snout while you're down here.

1417
01:34:36,671 --> 01:34:38,639
Come on, Flash, honey.

1418
01:34:38,706 --> 01:34:43,336
Let's go get some little greeny-weenies,
some Chinese schoolboys.

1419
01:34:44,612 --> 01:34:46,512
Oh, no, call me "Boss."

1420
01:34:48,516 --> 01:34:51,041
I got you, Boss, right here in my britches.

1421
01:34:52,953 --> 01:34:57,481
This is Rosco P. Coltrane,
production fuck-stick.

1422
01:35:00,294 --> 01:35:01,318
Marker.

1423
01:35:03,898 --> 01:35:06,731
- You got all tongue-tied, Boss?
- I sure did, yeah.

1424
01:35:07,134 --> 01:35:10,934
Did you step in something, son,
because there's some kind of...

1425
01:35:12,339 --> 01:35:13,465
Help.

1426
01:35:13,541 --> 01:35:14,906
Oh, shit.

1427
01:35:14,975 --> 01:35:16,237
There goes my career!

1428
01:35:16,310 --> 01:35:18,835
It's suicide. It's suicide.

1429
01:35:18,913 --> 01:35:21,074
I gotta... I gotta get out!

1430
01:35:28,022 --> 01:35:29,148
English
