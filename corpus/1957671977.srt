Taught me how to play guitar.

763
00:45:16,113 --> 00:45:20,250
He had this old guitar that he use to pawn when he'd go on a run.

764

00:53:35,845 --> 00:53:37,547
Just down to the car, it would be great.

895
00:53:37,581 --> 00:53:38,648
Sure.

896
00:53:40,750 --> 00:53:42,719
Oh, don't tell me you got rid of the Mustang now.

897
00:53:42,752 --> 00:53:45,555
Oh, please! I got so tired of these old boys

898
00:53:45,589 --> 00:53:49,326
pullin' up next to me at every stoplight wantin' to drag race.

899
00:53:49,826 --> 00:53:52,896
So you here to sort out your granddad's business?

900
00:53:52,929 --> 00:53:54,798
Yeah, yeah, I am gonna go to the bank,

901
00:53:54,831 --> 00:53:56,833
Monday, and see what he left me.

902
00:53:56,866 --> 00:53:58,835
And then back to Austin?

903
00:53:58,868 --> 00:54:01,037
I don't know. There' not really much left for me there.

904
00:54:02,439 --> 00:54:05,275
Hey, guys, whoa. Why don't you say hi to Bailey?

905
00:54:07,010 --> 00:54:08,044
Hey, guys. Hi.

906
00:54:08,078 --> 00:54:09,713
This is my son, Scooter,

907
00:54:09,746 --> 00:54:11,915
and this is my nephew, Weston.

908
00:54:12,115 --> 00:54:15,318
Is Bailey going to play T-ball with us?

909
00:54:15,352 --> 00:54:17,854
No, he is not gonna play T-ball with you guys.

910
00:54:18,054 --> 00:54:19,990
He is really busy.

911
00:54:20,023 --> 00:54:22,392
Um, you guys ready for T-ball?

912
00:54:22,626 --> 00:54:24,928
Yeah? Well, I don't see any gloves here.

913
00:54:24,961 --> 00:54:26,296
Yeah, why don't you go back and get 'em?

914
00:54:27,364 --> 00:54:29,332
Go on. My God, you're a mom.

915
00:54:29,366 --> 00:54:30,533
I know.

916
00:54:31,067 --> 00:54:34,437
My mom had five of us kids and I have no idea how she did it.

917
00:54:34,471 --> 00:54:36,740
Who is the, um... Who is the dad?

918
00:54:38,508 --> 00:54:40,410
Harold. Harold Goggins?

919
00:54:40,677 --> 00:54:41,878
Mmm-hmm.

920
00:54:42,979 --> 00:54:44,414
Or Charlie.

921
00:54:44,447 --> 00:54:45,715
Charlie?

922
00:54:45,749 --> 00:54:46,916
Johnson.

923
00:54:47,517 --> 00:54:49,753
You're talkin' about the barbecue place guy?

924
00:54:49,786 --> 00:54:51,321
Yeah, Johnson's Barbeque.

925
00:54:52,555 --> 00:54:54,658
Yeah, I mean, they make a great pulled-pork sandwich.

926
00:54:54,691 --> 00:54:57,627
Yeah, not anymore, not since old man Johnson died,

927
00:54:57,661 --> 00:54:58,762
they changed the rub.

928
00:54:58,795 --> 00:55:00,897
It hasn't been the same.

929
00:55:00,930 --> 00:55:03,667
Although, I thought for a while it might be Preston.

930
00:55:04,868 --> 00:55:05,902
Preston Willis?

931
00:55:05,935 --> 00:55:07,504
Ew! No.

932
00:55:07,804 --> 00:55:08,938
Foster.

933
00:55:09,139 --> 00:55:11,441
But it turns out he's sterile,

934
00:55:11,474 --> 00:55:12,942
so it couldn't have been him.

935
00:55:14,944 --> 00:55:16,012
Yeah.

936
00:55:17,013 --> 00:55:18,481
I'm just messing with you!

937
00:55:20,050 --> 00:55:22,886
His daddy's a lawyer down in Tuscaloosa.

938
00:55:23,453 --> 00:55:26,756
We broke up a couple of years ago and moved back home.

939
00:55:28,058 --> 00:55:30,994
He's not a bad guy. Just wasn't the right guy.

940
00:55:34,097 --> 00:55:35,899
Do you know Santa's off of 565?

941
00:55:35,932 --> 00:55:36,900
Yeah.

942
00:55:36,933 --> 00:55:39,736
Well, they are doin' a benefit show tonight.

943
00:55:39,769 --> 00:55:40,970
And there's gonna be some great bands there.

944
00:55:41,004 --> 00:55:42,539
It's gonna be for really good cause.

945
00:55:42,572 --> 00:55:44,040
I think you... Got 'em.

946
00:55:44,074 --> 00:55:45,408
Great. Let's go.

947
00:55:45,442 --> 00:55:46,710
I think you should come.

948
00:55:46,743 --> 00:55:48,945
Yeah, I don't think so. It's to support education.

949
00:55:48,978 --> 00:55:50,413
Supports T-ball. Lots of T-ball stuff goin' on.

950
00:55:50,447 --> 00:55:51,748
I am out of T-ball support.

951
00:55:51,781 --> 00:55:52,882
It's gonna be great.

952
00:55:52,916 --> 00:55:54,017
Get on in there.

953
00:55:54,050 --> 00:55:57,520
Yeah, I don't think I would be able to find a sitter.

954
00:55:57,754 --> 00:55:59,856
I just... I don't think it'd be a good idea.

955
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:04,794
It was nice seein' you, Bailey.

956
00:56:05,095 --> 00:56:06,496
You, too.

957
00:56:07,063 --> 00:56:08,498
(TAPS CAR)

958
00:56:08,531 --> 00:56:10,500
Hey, you guys play good, all right?

959
00:56:35,892 --> 00:56:37,861
SANTA: Did you talk to him?

960
00:56:37,894 --> 00:56:39,129
I'm tryin'.

961
00:56:39,162 --> 00:56:41,865
Don't tell me you're tryin'. I am holdin' this.

962
00:56:41,898 --> 00:56:43,533
That's doin' somethin'.

963
00:56:43,566 --> 00:56:45,602
Don't try to do it, do it.

964
00:56:46,236 --> 00:56:48,772
Oh, Mr. Bailey, how you doin'?

965
00:56:49,239 --> 00:56:50,774
How'd it go?

966
00:56:52,175 --> 00:56:53,510
Not so good.

967
00:56:54,778 --> 00:56:57,046
I'm gonna go get the room ready for tonight.

968
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:59,182
Yeah, you ain't off the hook.

969
00:57:01,184 --> 00:57:02,585
But she didn't kick you out, did she?

970
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:04,554
Nope.

971
00:57:04,788 --> 00:57:07,023
'Cause she never even let me in.

972
00:57:07,590 --> 00:57:09,826

973
00:57:09,859 --> 00:57:11,194
A little while to open up.

974
00:57:11,227 --> 00:57:12,796
Yeah, I don't really think she's interested.

975
00:57:12,829 --> 00:57:14,998
Oh, I ain't talkin' about her. I'm talkin' about you.

976
00:57:15,565 --> 00:57:16,800

You want me to cry?

Tears is...

984
00:57:36,886 --> 00:57:39,122
Letting it all just flow on out.

985
00:57:40,089 --> 00:57:41,624
And blues is like that.

986
00:57:41,658 --> 00:57:44,561
Blues is like letting your tears flow.

987
00:57:44,861 --> 00:57:49,132
Now, how you gonna face an audience if you can't face what's inside you?

Hey, thanks for...

1099
01:05:26,789 --> 01:05:27,957
Thanks for comin'.

1100
01:05:28,391 --> 01:05:30,459
Of course, that was really nice.

1101
01:05:30,493 --> 01:05:32,528
No, I mean, it really...

1102
01:05:34,030 --> 01:05:35,531
It really meant a lot to me, you know.

Whoa! Easy there...

01:05:38,801 --> 01:05:42,071
I mean, I may be friendly, but I'm not stupid.

1106
01:05:42,305 --> 01:05:44,006
You know what, I'm stupid.

1107
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:45,041
Oh, yeah.

1108
01:05:45,675 --> 01:05:47,977
I'm stupid for letting you go

1110
01:05:50,446 --> 01:05:52,548
You have got some nerve!

1111
01:05:53,649 --> 01:05:58,187
You think you can just waltz in and we just pick up where we left off?

Yeah.

1119
01:06:14,603 --> 01:06:16,405
Well, I'm not gonna say it for you.

1120
01:06:16,439 --> 01:06:18,074
I'm sorry. You're sorry?

1121
01:06:18,107 --> 01:06:20,042
Yes. For what?

1122
01:06:20,076 --> 01:06:21,310

1123
01:06:21,344 --> 01:06:23,579
For that time that you wrecked my car?

1124
01:06:23,612 --> 01:06:27,817
Or for those times that you'd just kind of like disappear

1125
01:06:27,850 --> 01:06:31,554
and me not knowing if you're alive or dead?

1126
01:06:31,587 --> 01:06:33,522

Oh! I know!

01:06:43,632 --> 01:06:45,067
No! No?

1132
01:06:45,101 --> 01:06:48,070
Yes, yes. Okay, yes. I am sorry for that.

1133
01:06:48,104 --> 01:06:51,640
I am sorry for every shitty thing I did to you.

1134
01:06:53,776 --> 01:06:57,113
Okay? Look, I'm... I think I was...

1135
01:06:58,447 --> 01:06:59,482
I was really heavy.

1136
01:07:01,384 --> 01:07:02,551
Heavy? Yeah.

1137
01:07:02,585 --> 01:07:05,087
Like there was nothin' light about me.

1138
01:07:06,389 --> 01:07:08,557

1139
01:07:12,261 --> 01:07:13,529
I'm sorry.

01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:22,505

Well, Mr. Undercover Blues Man hisself.

1145
01:07:46,662 --> 01:07:47,830
What are you doing?

1146
01:07:48,898 --> 01:07:50,800
Oh, stuff I hate. Ooh!

1147
01:07:50,833 --> 01:07:53,202
I thought you were the guy who loves everything you do.

1148
01:07:54,570 --> 01:07:55,738
Not this bookkeeping crap.

1149
01:07:55,771 --> 01:07:59,175
I just... I'm gettin' too old for it, I guess, I don't know.

1150
01:07:59,208 --> 01:08:00,443
Well, don't shoot anybody over it.

1152
01:08:08,484 --> 01:08:10,586

1153
01:08:10,953 --> 01:08:14,156
Oh, he's probably out with one of them honeys.

1154
01:08:14,723 --> 01:08:17,893
Maybe both of 'em, huh? (CHUCKLES) Ought to be ashamed of himself.

1155
01:08:19,462 --> 01:08:21,163
Augy, Augy.

1156
01:08:21,363 --> 01:08:23,866
Was that hard-hearted Hannah you was dancin' with out there?

1157
01:08:23,899 --> 01:08:26,569
That pretty little girl with all that wonderful energy?

1158
01:08:28,471 --> 01:08:29,872
Don't walk away again, you hear me?

1159
01:08:32,241 --> 01:08:33,509
Yeah.

1160
01:08:38,647 --> 01:08:42,151
Hey, Santa, can I ask you a question?

1161
01:08:42,651 --> 01:08:43,719
Yup.

1162
01:08:50,626 --> 01:08:51,760
What made you quit drinking?

1163
01:08:55,831 --> 01:08:57,266
I killed somebody.

1164
01:08:59,702 --> 01:09:02,505
We were doing some concert north of here,

1165
01:09:03,606 --> 01:09:07,309
I was drunk as a skunk as usual.

1166
01:09:09,245 --> 01:09:11,213
Sally's probably sittin' out there in that audience

1167
01:09:11,247 --> 01:09:13,649
wonderin' what she's doin' this man.

1168
01:09:16,919 --> 01:09:18,621
Tells me not to drive, 'cause I'm too drunk.

1169
01:09:19,288 --> 01:09:20,623
But I knew better, you know.

1170
01:09:20,656 --> 01:09:23,893
I wasn't very easy to get along with in those days.

1171
01:09:23,926 --> 01:09:25,094
And I must have fallen asleep behind that wheel,

1172
01:09:25,127 --> 01:09:29,265
'cause the next thing I remember was Sally screamin' at me,

1173
01:09:29,298 --> 01:09:32,234
and I look out there, and I see we're headin' right for some man

1174
01:09:32,268 --> 01:09:34,270
walking alongside the road.

1175
01:09:34,803 --> 01:09:36,939
Sally pulls the wheel around, turns it,

1176
01:09:38,274 --> 01:09:39,208
and we miss the fella.

1177
01:09:41,277 --> 01:09:44,713
But the car goes off the road and hits this big oak tree.

1178
01:09:46,382 --> 01:09:48,284
Sally didn't have a mark on her,

1179
01:09:48,817 --> 01:09:51,687
but her insides was all messed up real good.

1180
01:09:52,054 --> 01:09:54,890
She looks at me real serious and she says,

1181
01:09:56,559 --> 01:09:59,295
"Well, I guess you're gonna have to borrow Marlon's car tomorrow

1182
01:09:59,328 --> 01:10:01,564
"to get up to Mooresville."

1183
01:10:02,665 --> 01:10:03,966
And passed.

1184
01:10:09,939 --> 01:10:12,541
(EXHALES) Well, I did some time for that,

1185
01:10:12,575 --> 01:10:15,778
and I noticed a lot of other fellows like me,

1186
01:10:17,346 --> 01:10:19,315
lack self esteem.

1187
01:10:20,583 --> 01:10:22,985
So I thought maybe I could help them.

1188
01:10:23,919 --> 01:10:27,790
Teach 'em to read. Teach 'em music. They liked that.

1189
01:10:27,823 --> 01:10:30,426
Music makes you feel good, don't it?

1190
01:10:34,363 --> 01:10:35,931
You want some chamomile tea?

1191
01:10:38,601 --> 01:10:40,002
Sure. All right.

1192
01:10:51,347 --> 01:10:53,349

1194
01:11:15,504 --> 01:11:18,374
I didn't know you played with Big Mama Thornton.

1195
01:11:18,407 --> 01:11:19,742
Yup.

1196
01:11:20,409 --> 01:11:21,610
Long time ago.

1197
01:11:21,644 --> 01:11:23,045
(LAUGHS SOFTLY)

1198
01:11:24,380 --> 01:11:25,848
I like the groovy mustache.

What is it?

1210
01:12:34,516 --> 01:12:35,384
Hmm?

1211
01:12:40,789 --> 01:12:42,558
Eugene Harris.

1212

Eugene Augustus Harris.

1213
01:12:50,866 --> 01:12:53,502
Yeah. When were you plannin' on tellin' me that?

1214
01:12:55,471 --> 01:12:56,472
(SHOUTS) When?

1215
01:12:57,473 --> 01:12:58,741
When we first met.

1216
01:12:59,975 --> 01:13:01,210
Tonight.

1217
01:13:01,243 --> 01:13:03,212
Bunch of places in between, I don't know.

1218
01:13:03,245 --> 01:13:06,448
Yeah. Yeah, I bet you were. But you know what?

1219
01:13:07,483 --> 01:13:09,852
You didn't have the balls, did you?

1220
01:13:09,885 --> 01:13:11,553
You know why?

1221
01:13:11,587 --> 01:13:12,454
You're a coward!

1222
01:13:13,822 --> 01:13:15,457
I wanted to tell you.

1223
01:13:16,759 --> 01:13:19,495
But I figured the best way to make amends was to help you.

1224
01:13:19,528 --> 01:13:20,929
Help me?

1225
01:13:20,963 --> 01:13:23,165
What, by showin' me you can do whatever the hell you want

1226
01:13:23,198 --> 01:13:25,601
and not pay any consequences?

1227
01:13:25,634 --> 01:13:26,902
Is that how you're gonna help me?

1228
01:13:26,935 --> 01:13:29,972
I spent nine years in prison, Bailey.

1229
01:13:30,572 --> 01:13:33,142
Yeah, I've spent my whole life there, partner, all right.

1230
01:13:33,175 --> 01:13:35,177
So, why don't you shut up?

1231
01:13:35,844 --> 01:13:38,213
I'm not sayin' what I did was right,

1232
01:13:38,781 --> 01:13:41,216
in fact, (STUTTERS) it's far from it.

1233
01:13:43,819 --> 01:13:45,454
You know what, Augy?

1234
01:13:46,789 --> 01:13:48,824
You're the one who's heavy.

1235
01:13:50,225 --> 01:13:51,794
To kill an innocent man like that.

1236
01:13:54,596 --> 01:13:55,964
Run him over.

1237
01:13:56,999 --> 01:13:58,934
Knock him into a field,

1238
01:14:00,903 --> 01:14:02,538
while I waited there.

1239
01:14:03,806 --> 01:14:06,508
Waited for him by the damn roadside!

1240
01:14:06,542 --> 01:14:09,211
Waited for him all night long to come home.

1241
01:14:10,579 --> 01:14:14,516
What, were you passed out while I sat there on the curb? Is that...

1242
01:14:14,550 --> 01:14:15,984
Is that what you're sorry for?

1243
01:14:19,087 --> 01:14:20,556
I'm sorry.

1244
01:14:22,958 --> 01:14:25,060
From the bottom of my heart,

1245
01:14:26,094 --> 01:14:27,996
I'm sorry.

1246
01:14:28,030 --> 01:14:30,866
You took everything from me, you know that?

1247
