00:00:21,635 --> 00:00:23,570
MAN: Gentlemen,
here's what we're up against.

2
00:00:23,604 --> 00:00:27,168
Romano, Francis A.
Also known as "Pops. "

3
00:00:27,211 --> 00:00:29,077
Alleged leader
of the Romano crime family...

4
00:00:29,114 --> 00:00:30,605
with a network
of racketeering...

5
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:32,414
prostitution,
and underground casinos...

6
00:00:32,453 --> 00:00:33,853
polluting the tri-state area.

7
00:00:35,658 --> 00:00:38,356
This is Paulie Romano,
Pops' oldest son.

8
00:00:38,396 --> 00:00:40,797
He's popular with the ladies
and good with a knife.

9
00:00:40,833 --> 00:00:42,996
Though Paulie seems to have
those around him fooled...

10
00:00:43,037 --> 00:00:44,938
sources indicate he is
functionally illiterate...

11
00:00:44,973 --> 00:00:46,566
and has
an inferiority complex...

12
00:00:46,609 --> 00:00:49,079
Leading to unexpected
outbursts of violence.

13
00:00:50,248 --> 00:00:52,114
Peter Romano,
Pops' youngest son...

14
00:00:52,152 --> 00:00:53,882
and the alleged muscle
of the family.

15
00:00:53,921 --> 00:00:56,288
Spent time upstate
after a barroom incident.

16
00:00:56,325 --> 00:00:58,157
Though he hides it well,
word is he's got...

17
00:00:58,194 --> 00:01:00,323
deeply repressed
homosexual tendencies...

18
00:01:00,365 --> 00:01:03,564
also leading to unexpected
outbursts of violence.

19
00:01:03,604 --> 00:01:06,473
Leo Corrigan,
Pops' right hand man.

20
00:01:06,509 --> 00:01:08,808
He's our informant still
inside the family circle.

21
00:01:08,845 --> 00:01:10,837
With the information
we've received from Leo...

22
00:01:10,882 --> 00:01:14,787
We've finally got Pops Romano
right where we want him.

to the charges against you?

29
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:37,050
What we have here
is a modern-day witch hunt.

30
00:01:37,091 --> 00:01:39,220
The only thing
my client is guilty of...

31
00:01:39,262 --> 00:01:41,163
is having a vowel
at the end of his name.

32
00:01:41,199 --> 00:01:42,326

Pops, what do you think...

33
00:01:42,367 --> 00:01:43,858

of your life in prison?

00:01:43,903 --> 00:01:45,531

-Eh...
-Pop, the trial's in a week.

50
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:26,200
I mean, they claim
they got an airtight case--

51

names, dates, numbers--info
on the whole organization.

52
00:02:29,411 --> 00:02:31,004
Well, the only way
they could get that...

53
00:02:31,047 --> 00:02:33,039
is if they had an informant.

54
00:02:33,083 --> 00:02:36,954
No. They must've sent
some fed in undercover.

They put somebody undercover.

We'll put somebody
undercover...

59

to destroy that evidence.

60

Wait, we can't do that.
Who the hell we going to send?

61
00:02:56,422 --> 00:02:57,913
They got pictures and files
on us...

62
00:02:57,958 --> 00:02:59,392
and everybody we deal with.

63
00:02:59,427 --> 00:03:02,398

00:08:30,168 --> 00:08:33,105
-Poodles and Pussies.
-Let go, baby Jesus.

178
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:34,802
Corky, you have a phone call.

179
00:08:34,842 --> 00:08:36,903
Come on.
I'm a little busy right now.

180
00:08:36,946 --> 00:08:39,279
-It's your brother.
-Come on.

181
00:08:55,176 --> 00:08:57,476
Hug? Come on.

182
00:08:57,513 --> 00:09:00,780
Come on. Come on.
Come on, come on, come on.

183
00:09:11,603 --> 00:09:13,265
How's dad doing?

184
00:09:13,306 --> 00:09:17,176
Not good, and he's waiting
for you upstairs.

185
00:09:17,212 --> 00:09:18,373
OK.

186
00:09:23,623 --> 00:09:26,525
Hey, Paulie. How are ya?

187
00:09:27,562 --> 00:09:29,531
You look fit.

188
00:09:29,565 --> 00:09:31,193
What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

189
00:09:31,235 --> 00:09:34,263
CORKY: Nothing.
We're going to start over, OK?

190
00:09:35,809 --> 00:09:37,870
-It's nice to see you, buddy.
-[Farts]

191
00:09:37,913 --> 00:09:40,644
Well...that was nice.

192
00:09:40,683 --> 00:09:43,916
-Corky.
-Papa.

193
00:09:49,431 --> 00:09:51,958
Hi, papa.
I brought you something.

194
00:09:53,805 --> 00:09:55,273
[Opens suitcase]

195
00:09:57,311 --> 00:10:00,146
Black Beauty by Anna Sewell.

196
00:10:00,182 --> 00:10:01,775
This is the very same copy...

197
00:10:01,818 --> 00:10:03,810
that you and mom used
to read to me when I was sick.

198
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:09,926
CORKY: What is it, papa?
You want to say something?

199
00:10:09,965 --> 00:10:13,300
You're kneeling
on my air tube, asshole.

200
00:10:13,337 --> 00:10:14,828
Oh, my God, I'm sorry.

201
00:10:14,873 --> 00:10:16,866
I got it. I--I'm so sorry.

202
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:18,401
I got it now. I got--

203
00:10:18,446 --> 00:10:20,847
[Air hissing]

204
00:10:20,883 --> 00:10:22,784
I got it.
This thing's slippery.

205
00:10:22,819 --> 00:10:24,310
Heh heh!

206
00:10:27,493 --> 00:10:30,055
Ahh. Ay yi yi.

207
00:10:30,098 --> 00:10:31,794
Come on, Pops,
this is ridiculous.

208
00:10:31,834 --> 00:10:34,669
Look at him. He should be
wearing a helmet.

209
00:10:34,706 --> 00:10:37,199
POPS: Corky, come here.

210
00:10:40,916 --> 00:10:44,820
I'm not going to lie
to you anymore.

211
00:10:44,855 --> 00:10:46,757
I'm not a landscaper.

212
00:10:46,792 --> 00:10:49,261
I don't know
what you're talking about.

213
00:10:49,296 --> 00:10:51,664
Get your head out of the sand,
shit for brains.

214
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:53,100
How many landscapers
you know...

215
00:10:53,136 --> 00:10:55,469
get paid in briefcases
full of cash, huh?

216
00:10:55,506 --> 00:10:58,841
Oh, you--you do do
some landscaping though, right?

217
00:10:58,878 --> 00:11:01,440
I dabble in
money laundering, gambling...

218
00:11:01,483 --> 00:11:03,384
and the occasional landscaping.

219
00:11:04,821 --> 00:11:06,449
POPS: Now, look, son...

220
00:11:06,491 --> 00:11:09,155
I know you're not comfortable
with the family business...

221
00:11:09,195 --> 00:11:10,629
but we don't have much time.

222
00:11:10,664 --> 00:11:14,933
I want you to go undercover
as an FBI agent...

223
00:11:14,972 --> 00:11:18,603
and destroy the evidence
against me.

224
00:11:18,644 --> 00:11:20,442
[Laughs] Oh.

225
00:11:21,682 --> 00:11:24,949
But I have animals
that depend on me.

226
00:11:24,988 --> 00:11:27,082
We'll send someone
to fill in for you.

227
00:11:29,829 --> 00:11:32,391
Do you really think I'm
the most qualified? I mean...

228
00:11:32,434 --> 00:11:36,099
The consensus is that
you're the least qualified...

229
00:11:36,139 --> 00:11:38,905
but you're family.

230
00:11:38,944 --> 00:11:40,708
Could l, uh...

231
00:11:40,747 --> 00:11:43,274
could l--could l--
could I think about this?

232
00:11:43,318 --> 00:11:45,014
What's to think about, Corky?

233
00:11:45,054 --> 00:11:46,579
Can't you see Pops
swallowed his pride...

234
00:11:46,623 --> 00:11:47,886
just asking you to do this?

235
00:11:47,926 --> 00:11:50,521
When's the last time you lifted
a finger for this family?

236
00:11:50,563 --> 00:11:55,230
It's just all--You know,
it's all happening so fast.

237
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:58,470
Wait, wait.
Let me talk to him.

238
00:12:02,749 --> 00:12:07,382
Look, kid, think of this
as your chance to make amends.

239
00:12:07,424 --> 00:12:08,824
You know
you broke your pop's heart...

240
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:11,228
when you turned your back
on the family business.

241
00:12:11,264 --> 00:12:14,360
I didn't turn my back. They
kicked me out after mom died.

242
00:12:14,402 --> 00:12:17,965
Irregardless, what matters now
is your family needs you.

243
00:12:18,008 --> 00:12:19,408
What do you say, kid?

244
00:12:28,124 --> 00:12:30,219
Paulie, you get another DUI
you need fixed?

245
00:12:30,262 --> 00:12:31,389
No, I need you to send
something to the FBl.

246
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:32,692
Can you handle that?

247
00:12:32,732 --> 00:12:34,132
DEXTER: Peter,
look who you're talking to.

248
00:12:34,167 --> 00:12:36,535
I got a 120-gig hard drive...

249
00:12:36,572 --> 00:12:38,905
and a digital connection
NASA would envy.

250
00:12:38,942 --> 00:12:41,378
Whoa!
ls that one of those epsons...

251
00:12:41,413 --> 00:12:42,847
you can print
greeting cards on?

252
00:12:42,882 --> 00:12:44,214
Shut up, Corky.

253
00:12:44,251 --> 00:12:47,381
OK, tell me exactly
what you need.

254
00:12:47,423 --> 00:12:48,686
I need you
to plant Corky here...

255
00:12:48,725 --> 00:12:50,284
with the FBI station
in Park Realm.

256
00:12:50,328 --> 00:12:52,422
Set him up with a fake
background, name, and resume.

257
00:12:52,464 --> 00:12:53,864
And it better be a good one...

258
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:54,959
because if they don't
accept his transfer...

259
00:12:55,002 --> 00:12:56,196
I'm personally
going to download...

260
00:12:56,237 --> 00:12:58,400
500 megabytes
of my fist up your ass.

261
00:12:58,441 --> 00:13:01,412
CORKY: Uh, technically,
you'd be uploading that.

262
00:13:01,446 --> 00:13:03,176
But, you know, not
that I'm a computer whiz...

263
00:13:03,215 --> 00:13:04,706
or anything, because I'm not.

264
00:13:04,751 --> 00:13:06,083
Just do the right thing,
Dexter.

265
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,611
I don't want
to have to kill you.

266
00:13:07,656 --> 00:13:10,821
CORKY: Come on.
Let's settle down, huh?

267
00:13:10,861 --> 00:13:13,559
All right.
What should his name be?

268
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,931
I really don't care
what you call him, Pissant.

269
00:13:14,968 --> 00:13:16,596
PETER: Come on, guys.

270
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:24,071
CORKY: For my resume,
I'm very good with animals.

271
00:13:24,116 --> 00:13:25,778
Thanks.

272
00:13:25,819 --> 00:13:27,686
If you're going to keep
hanging out with us...

273
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:29,282
could you at least
try and carry yourself...

274
00:13:29,325 --> 00:13:30,884
a little bit more like us,
please?

275
00:13:30,928 --> 00:13:34,161
Oh, you mean with unmitigated
rage and violence?

276
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,964
Look, stop trying to talk
like mom, all right?

277
00:13:36,003 --> 00:13:37,198
You're too soft.

278
00:13:37,238 --> 00:13:38,466
You complimented that guy
on his equipment...

279
00:13:38,506 --> 00:13:40,669
and then you thanked him
for his time.

280
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:41,973
I mean, Christ, Corky,
you might as well give him...

281
00:13:42,013 --> 00:13:43,879
a glass of wine
and a handshake.

282
00:13:43,915 --> 00:13:45,349
Are you guys familiar
with the expression...

283
00:13:45,385 --> 00:13:47,183
"you catch more bees
with honey than vinegar"?

284
00:13:47,221 --> 00:13:48,348
You know that one.

285
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:50,723
Ow! Ow! Ouch!

286
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,422
What is your problem?

287
00:13:52,462 --> 00:13:53,953
Paulie,
where the hell is this place?

288
00:13:53,998 --> 00:13:55,227
-I don't know.
-What place?

289
00:13:55,267 --> 00:13:56,428
The motel.

290
00:13:56,469 --> 00:13:58,563
But I thought I was staying
in the house in my old room.

291
00:13:58,606 --> 00:14:00,735
-You can't stay in the house.
-Why not?

292
00:14:00,777 --> 00:14:02,143
Well, a couple of reasons.

293
00:14:02,179 --> 00:14:04,341
Number one, the house
is under surveillance.

294
00:14:04,382 --> 00:14:06,578
Number two, we turned
your old room into a gym...

295
00:14:06,619 --> 00:14:07,780
and threw out all your shit.

296
00:14:09,123 --> 00:14:11,958
I thought I was going to--
God, what is--

297
00:14:11,995 --> 00:14:14,021
Why did--
why did you do that?

298
00:14:14,065 --> 00:14:16,297
-Shut up.
-Listen to your brother.

299
00:14:31,761 --> 00:14:33,354
All right,
pull down your pants.

300
00:14:33,397 --> 00:14:34,591
No.

301
00:14:34,631 --> 00:14:36,327
Corky, I'm not going
to give you a wedgie.

302
00:14:36,367 --> 00:14:38,064
I'm going to put a wire on you.

303
00:14:38,105 --> 00:14:39,265
It's Uncle Leo's idea...

304
00:14:39,306 --> 00:14:40,467
in case you get
in over your head in there.

305
00:14:40,508 --> 00:14:42,876
Let's go. Pull down your pants.

306
00:14:42,912 --> 00:14:44,072
Let's go.

307
00:14:51,192 --> 00:14:52,956

308
00:14:52,995 --> 00:14:54,987
-Hey.
-Come on!

309
00:14:55,031 --> 00:14:58,161
-[Laughs] Stop that.
-Knock it off!

310
00:14:58,203 --> 00:14:59,728
OK. I'm sorry.

311
00:15:02,878 --> 00:15:04,369
Move your hands.

312
00:15:08,554 --> 00:15:09,954
-[Zips up pants]
-Ow! Ow! Ow!

313
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:11,322
All right,
give me a sound check.

314
00:15:13,295 --> 00:15:14,422
Go ahead.

All right, we're good.
We're good. That's good.

-B-i-n-g--

319
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:28,117
OK. All right.

keep a low profile.

In and out.
No bullshit. Got it?

323
00:15:34,162 --> 00:15:36,223
All right, you better walk
the rest of the way.

324
00:15:36,266 --> 00:15:38,827
CORKY: You know what this
kind ofreminds me of?

325
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:41,033
When I was younger,
and mom dropped me off...

326
00:15:41,074 --> 00:15:43,543
at Camp Young and Chubby
for overweight teens.

327
00:15:43,578 --> 00:15:46,014
And I was crying,
because I didn't want to go...

328
00:15:46,049 --> 00:15:47,813
but at the end of the summer...

329
00:15:47,852 --> 00:15:49,787
I was crying because
I didn't want to leave.

330
00:15:49,821 --> 00:15:51,552
Isn't it weird...

331
00:15:51,592 --> 00:15:54,585
how thingsjust kind of
work out that way?

332
00:15:58,135 --> 00:16:01,436
Fifty bucks says he doesn't
make it through the front door.

Empty your pockets,
please, sir.

343
00:16:57,499 --> 00:17:00,230
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't
realize you were an agent.

344
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:02,069
I didn't know
you were with the bureau.

345
00:17:02,107 --> 00:17:05,135
Yes, I am with the bureau.

346
00:17:05,179 --> 00:17:09,447
Ahem. I'm sorry. I just--
I had a little too much coffee.

00:17:09,485 --> 00:17:12,149
I'm just a little wired.
Aah!

348
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:14,558
I mean "wired" as in "jumpy."
I don't mean "wired"...

349
00:17:14,594 --> 00:17:16,028
as in there's a concealed wire
in my crotch.

350
00:17:16,063 --> 00:17:18,225
CORKY: I mean, an FBI agent
wearing a concealed wire...

351
00:17:18,266 --> 00:17:20,394
in his crotch--I mean,
that would be crazy, right?

352
00:17:20,436 --> 00:17:22,132
Right?

353
00:17:22,172 --> 00:17:23,401
You can go now, agent.

354
00:17:23,441 --> 00:17:26,037
I will go now. Thank you.

355
00:17:28,817 --> 00:17:30,217
Excuse me.

356
00:17:30,253 --> 00:17:32,916
I had a small confrontation
at the checkpoint...

357
00:17:32,957 --> 00:17:35,052
but don't worry.
I kept a cool head...

358
00:17:35,094 --> 00:17:38,293
and I eradicated
any possible suspicions.

359
00:17:40,169 --> 00:17:41,728
Agent Pissant?

360
00:17:44,143 --> 00:17:46,044
Ah!

361
00:17:46,079 --> 00:17:49,573
Yes. Hi. Uh...

362
00:17:49,618 --> 00:17:52,316
Oh, actually, that's, uh...

363
00:17:52,356 --> 00:17:53,482
[French accent]
that's Pissant.

364
00:17:53,525 --> 00:17:55,255
Well, the transfer came
through at an opportune time.

365
00:17:55,294 --> 00:17:57,957
We could use someone
with your experience...

366
00:17:57,998 --> 00:17:59,227
on our special task force.

367
00:17:59,267 --> 00:18:02,033
CORKY: Ooh!
A special task force, huh?

368
00:18:02,072 --> 00:18:03,131
SHUSTER: That's right.

369
00:18:03,174 --> 00:18:05,439
An elite team I've assembled--
the best of the best...

370
00:18:05,477 --> 00:18:07,275
exclusively devoted
to catching the Night Vulture.

371
00:18:07,313 --> 00:18:08,576
Night Vulture?

372
00:18:08,615 --> 00:18:09,981
SHUSTER: Number six
on the most wanted list.

373
00:18:10,018 --> 00:18:12,318
The biggest heroin supplier
on the east coast...

374
00:18:12,355 --> 00:18:14,415
not to mention
the most sadistic.

375
00:18:14,459 --> 00:18:15,620
Grr!

376
00:18:15,661 --> 00:18:17,289
The last four guys
that pissed him off...

377
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:18,958
ended up
with their genitals severed.

378
00:18:18,999 --> 00:18:20,661
I asked the coroner
about the weapon.

379
00:18:20,702 --> 00:18:22,295
He says there was none.

380
00:18:22,338 --> 00:18:24,671
That son of a bitch
did it with his bare hands.

381
00:18:24,708 --> 00:18:25,835
Oh.

382
00:18:25,877 --> 00:18:27,938
I'm Agent Howard Shuster,
station director.

383
00:18:27,981 --> 00:18:29,278
Hi.

384
00:18:29,316 --> 00:18:32,219
This is Brick Davis,
senior agent...

385
00:18:32,254 --> 00:18:33,950
and my right hand man.

386
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:35,720
Agent Pissant.

387
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,057
CORKY: Uh, actually,
that's, uh...

388
00:18:37,095 --> 00:18:38,928
[French accent]
it's Pissant.

389
00:18:38,966 --> 00:18:41,527
It's--it's--
You know, it's French.

390
00:18:41,569 --> 00:18:43,562
SHUSTER: Davis
is the best man in his field.

391
00:18:43,607 --> 00:18:45,074
Right now,
he's about to take down...

392
00:18:45,108 --> 00:18:46,667
the city's most dangerous
crime boss.

393
00:18:46,712 --> 00:18:49,546
We're all but guaranteed
a conviction.

394
00:18:49,582 --> 00:18:52,075
That's just one down.
By the time I'm finished...

395
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,486
the whole family
will be injail.

396
00:18:53,523 --> 00:18:55,151
SHUSTER: I'vejust been
reviewing your resume.

397
00:18:55,192 --> 00:18:57,924
Quite impressive,
but a degree from Harvard...

398
00:18:57,963 --> 00:19:00,125
three commendations
for bravery...

399
00:19:00,167 --> 00:19:01,635
and an olympic medal
for sharpshooting...

400
00:19:01,669 --> 00:19:03,831
won't get you
out of the trenches.

401
00:19:03,872 --> 00:19:07,072
We need all hands on deck
around here.

402
00:19:07,112 --> 00:19:08,272
Good day.

403
00:19:09,715 --> 00:19:10,876
Good day.

404
00:19:10,918 --> 00:19:13,616
Sir? Thank you.

405
00:19:17,996 --> 00:19:20,465
DA VIS: Nice tie.

406
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,627
Thank you.

407
00:19:21,669 --> 00:19:23,399
It should give
some lucky sniper...

408
00:19:23,438 --> 00:19:25,100
a nice target to aim for.

409
00:19:25,141 --> 00:19:27,133
[Laughs]

410
00:19:29,815 --> 00:19:31,340
Probably, huh?

411

[Rummaging]

412
00:19:48,112 --> 00:19:50,013
Just go. Go.
I want to go home.

413
00:19:50,048 --> 00:19:52,108
-What happened?
-Have you seen my resume?

414
00:19:52,151 --> 00:19:53,676
It says I know
five different languages.

415
00:19:53,721 --> 00:19:54,950
I'm an expert sharpshooter.

416
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:56,686
I'm a black belt
in something called...

417
00:19:56,726 --> 00:19:58,855
gyoing gyoing gyoing
something?

418
00:19:58,896 --> 00:20:00,831
So the hacker
went a little crazy.

419
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:02,994
Ah, none of this shit matters.

420
00:20:03,036 --> 00:20:04,231
Just go in there
and get the evidence.

421
00:20:04,272 --> 00:20:06,104
Then you can go back
to giving hamsters enemas...

422
00:20:06,141 --> 00:20:07,302
or whatever the hell you do.

423
00:20:07,343 --> 00:20:10,940
-No!
-Get in there.

424
00:20:10,982 --> 00:20:13,509
-No, I don't wanna!
-Get in there!

425
00:20:13,553 --> 00:20:16,353
No, I don't wanna let go!
I don't wanna!

426
00:20:16,392 --> 00:20:19,363
I don't wanna let go!
All right. OK, OK.

427
00:20:19,397 --> 00:20:21,059
Put me down. Put me down.

428
00:20:27,743 --> 00:20:30,407
PAULIE: Come here.
Come here, God--

429
00:20:33,086 --> 00:20:34,952
All right, forget about it,
Paulie. This is pointless.

430
00:20:34,989 --> 00:20:36,582
You know what?
We're going to have to have...

431
00:20:36,625 --> 00:20:38,184
an ambulance standing by...

432
00:20:38,227 --> 00:20:40,423
for when we break the news
to papa.

433
00:20:44,204 --> 00:20:46,332
OK. I'll do it.

434
00:20:47,443 --> 00:20:49,173
I'm sorry.
Which way to the evidence room?

435
00:20:49,212 --> 00:20:51,181
Thank you.

436
00:20:54,687 --> 00:20:56,349
Hi.

437
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:58,189

Yeah. Actually, that's...
It's Pissant.

It's--it's French.

440
00:21:04,404 --> 00:21:08,274
I'm Russo, part of
the Night Vulture task force.

00:21:15,989 --> 00:21:18,585
Russo. Agent Russo.

446
00:21:18,627 --> 00:21:20,755
What a beautiful,
beautiful name.

we need you. He struck again.

Right there,
in their larval stage.

477

The keys are right there.

881
00:43:23,931 --> 00:43:26,333
If you could just...
turn off the car.

882
00:43:26,368 --> 00:43:29,065

What the hell is the matter
with you, dumbass?

893
00:44:00,992 --> 00:44:03,484
You nearly got us killed.
What are you, retarded? Huh?

894
00:44:03,528 --> 00:44:05,725
-What happened? You OK?
-Is everybody OK here?

895
00:44:05,766 --> 00:44:07,132
-Oh, I'm fine.
-You OK?

CORKY: I'm in control.
Just a little fender bender.

All right, out of the car.

tear this dago wagon apart.

907

908
00:44:42,092 --> 00:44:43,720
Hold it!

909
00:44:46,599 --> 00:44:47,726
What?

910
00:44:47,768 --> 00:44:50,101
This guy just called me a dork.

911
00:44:51,908 --> 00:44:54,378
-No, he didn't.
-No. Yeah, he did.

912
00:44:54,412 --> 00:44:56,643
-I don't think he did.
-I saw--I read his lips.

It's me. Corky. Hi.

On the ground, both of you!

All fours. All fours.

917
00:45:36,147 --> 00:45:38,515
I got a little gift for you.

Hey, Pissant, relax, man.

926

get the evidence?

No. I don't have it.

that I can taste it.

what if somebody finds it?

No, it's OK!

he's getting worse.

They're sending a wet nurse
over here, Petey.

registered nurse.

Oh, really? ls that what
you think, Mr. Educated?

951

So now I'm the stupid one, huh?

952

Let me tell you something,
Corky.

When you was in vegetarian
school tugging llamas...

for Pops, you understand me?

-Get outta here!
-Out!

956
00:47:36,912 --> 00:47:38,072
And don't you come back--

957
00:47:38,113 --> 00:47:39,706
Do not come back without
the evidence, you hear me?

-All right, I'm going!

00:48:10,842 --> 00:48:12,504
I can explain.

-Explain it to Shuster.
-OK.

-How about now?
-Now's good.

966
00:48:20,626 --> 00:48:22,527
Pissant, we need you ASAP.

967
00:48:22,562 --> 00:48:25,533
-Not now. We're busy.
-This is priority.

is going down in Chinatown.

00:48:29,539 --> 00:48:31,338
No.
That's a waste of time.

971
00:48:31,377 --> 00:48:33,642
Get back to the planetarium
like I told you.

972
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:35,876
It's a virtual who's who
of Night Vulture suspects.

Sir, I don't know
who your source is...

974
00:48:37,419 --> 00:48:38,853
but we've been
to the planetarium...

975
00:48:38,888 --> 00:48:40,015
and it's on the level.

976
00:48:40,057 --> 00:48:41,889
Nothing but field trips
and old women.

977
00:48:41,926 --> 00:48:44,396
Exactly! The Night Vulture's
a chameleon!

978
00:48:44,431 --> 00:48:46,400
It's just the kind of place
a sadistic son of a bitch...

979
00:48:46,434 --> 00:48:47,959
Iike that would call home!

980
00:48:48,003 --> 00:48:49,995
Sorry, sir.
This is direct from Shuster.

981
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:52,533
We're going to Chinatown, and
we're taking Pissant with us.

982
00:48:56,918 --> 00:48:58,147
What's up, guys?

983
00:48:58,187 --> 00:49:00,986
The seller's from Vietnam,
the buyer's from Thailand.

984
00:49:01,024 --> 00:49:02,994
Sounds cool.
Where do I come in?

985
00:49:03,028 --> 00:49:04,860
You translate.

986
00:49:07,536 --> 00:49:08,730
Perfect.

987
00:49:23,328 --> 00:49:24,591
What did he say?

988
00:49:26,734 --> 00:49:30,467
He said that you have
very kind eyes.

989
00:49:32,309 --> 00:49:34,108
Tell him I said thank you.

990
00:49:43,661 --> 00:49:45,220
What?

991
00:50:13,811 --> 00:50:15,279
What is going on?

992
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:28,666
Aah!

993
00:50:30,772 --> 00:50:32,536

Ah, damn. They both got away.

1003
00:51:14,310 --> 00:51:16,245
No. Pissant got one.

[Chuckles]

1005
00:51:19,618 --> 00:51:22,646
You just reminded him of
this horse thief he once knew...

1006
00:51:22,690 --> 00:51:25,126
and I defended your honor...

1007
00:51:25,161 --> 00:51:27,221
and he grew angry.

1008
00:51:27,264 --> 00:51:29,096
You got a cool head, man.

1009
00:51:29,134 --> 00:51:31,000
Goin' down on your knees,
crying like a girl?

1010
00:51:31,037 --> 00:51:32,232
That was great!

1011
00:51:32,272 --> 00:51:36,177
That's something I learned
from our friend the possum.

1012
00:51:36,212 --> 00:51:39,342
It's a tactic he would use
to thwart off his enemies.

1013
00:51:39,384 --> 00:51:41,250
We'll back you up any time,
Pissant.

1014

-Mm-hmm.
-Call me Corky.

-My name's Terrence.
-Hey.

-I'm Bob.
-Hey, Bob.

1017
00:51:49,067 --> 00:51:51,731
You guys want to get
an orange julius or something?

1018
00:51:51,771 --> 00:51:54,936
We can't. Brick is sending us
to collect evidence...

1019
00:51:54,977 --> 00:51:56,343
on some underground casino.

1020
00:51:56,379 --> 00:51:59,076
Do you guys know
where Kate is, by chance?

1021
00:51:59,116 --> 00:52:01,348
She'd probably get a kick
out of this whole thing.

1022
00:52:01,387 --> 00:52:03,549
-She's gone.
-What do you mean, gone?

1023
00:52:03,590 --> 00:52:05,856
We're not at liberty
to discuss that.

1024
00:52:05,894 --> 00:52:08,090
Yeah, I know.
She didn't leave a note...

1025
00:52:08,131 --> 00:52:13,471
or a joke or a little poem,
by chance, did she?

1026
00:52:13,507 --> 00:52:15,840
Nope. See ya.

Give me one good reason...

1029

I shouldn't can your ass
right now...

1030
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:24,116
for breaking protocol
with that Romano file?

1031
00:52:24,157 --> 00:52:26,150
Sir, I just wanted to get
a closer look at the file...

1032
00:52:26,194 --> 00:52:27,753
and lend my expertise, sir.

1033
00:52:27,797 --> 00:52:29,823
You don't walk in
and take evidence!

1034
00:52:29,867 --> 00:52:31,836
You fill out an X-7-4!

1035
00:52:31,870 --> 00:52:35,171
And then you get it approved
by a superior! You got that?

1036
00:52:35,208 --> 00:52:38,806
Sir, the bottom line is,
because I got so excited...

1037
00:52:38,848 --> 00:52:40,578
I forgot
to follow procedures...

1038
00:52:40,618 --> 00:52:43,748
but I do take full
responsibility for my actions.

1039
00:52:46,828 --> 00:52:48,126
Pissant, you're an honest man.

1040
00:52:48,164 --> 00:52:51,135
That's a rare quality
in this day of buck-passing.

1041
00:52:51,169 --> 00:52:54,003
-I kind of admire that.
-Oh, what the hell?!

1042
00:52:54,039 --> 00:52:56,271
He just confessed
to breaking protocol!

1043
00:52:56,310 --> 00:52:58,803
At least he had the guts
to admit it.

1044
00:53:00,951 --> 00:53:04,411
We can all take a page
out of Pissant's book.

1045
00:53:04,457 --> 00:53:05,686
Good day.

1046
00:53:07,295 --> 00:53:08,888

[Little girl voice] Hi.
You guys want some cookies?

1049
00:53:33,137 --> 00:53:34,800
[Sighs]
I'm sorry, you guys.

1050
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:36,365
What is it, Corky?

1051
00:53:36,409 --> 00:53:38,810
I couldn't get the--
Sweet Jesus!

1052
00:53:38,846 --> 00:53:40,610
[Gasps] Ay, Dios mo!

1053
00:53:40,649 --> 00:53:42,778
What is she doing here?

1054
00:53:42,820 --> 00:53:44,652
That's Esperanza,
dad's new nurse.

1055
00:53:44,689 --> 00:53:47,285
Don't worry about her. She
don't speak a word of English.

1056
00:53:47,327 --> 00:53:50,297
-How do you know my name?
-What?

1057
00:53:50,331 --> 00:53:54,134
-Corky.
-You said that name again.

1058
00:53:54,172 --> 00:53:55,572
Ha ha ha ha!

1059
00:53:55,607 --> 00:53:57,235
Why are you freakin' out?

1060
00:53:57,277 --> 00:54:00,339
CORKY:
I'm gonna go, uh, make some...

1061
00:54:00,382 --> 00:54:02,908
toaster strudel for everyone.

1062
00:54:02,953 --> 00:54:07,415
Anyone?
I assume everyone wants one.

1063
00:54:13,670 --> 00:54:15,195
[Whispering] What the hell
are you doing here?

1064
00:54:15,239 --> 00:54:17,436
What are you doing here? And
why are you dressed like that?

1065
00:54:17,476 --> 00:54:20,879
I just came from
a Girls of America meeting...

1066
00:54:20,915 --> 00:54:23,545
and I sponsor
one of the girls...

1067
00:54:23,587 --> 00:54:24,885
and it's traditional
that you wear...

1068
00:54:24,922 --> 00:54:27,187
these outfits at the meetings.

1069
00:54:27,226 --> 00:54:30,197
I don't have time to talk.
What are you doing here?

1070
00:54:30,231 --> 00:54:31,824
I realized no one's
gonna just hand me...

1071
00:54:31,866 --> 00:54:33,425
a good undercover case,
so I made Shuster...

1072
00:54:33,469 --> 00:54:35,631
send me in here
to collect more evidence.

1073
00:54:35,672 --> 00:54:39,941
-What about you?
-I'm undercover, too.

1074
00:54:39,980 --> 00:54:42,917
That is so typical!
Shuster gave me his word...

1075
00:54:42,951 --> 00:54:44,419
that he wouldn't
send a man to cover me.

1076
00:54:44,454 --> 00:54:47,220
No, l-l was just here first.
That's why I'm here now.

1077
00:54:47,259 --> 00:54:48,454
How come Shuster
didn't say anything?

1078
00:54:48,494 --> 00:54:49,860
He doesn't know.

1079
00:54:49,896 --> 00:54:51,489
You're undercover
without clearance or backup?

1080
00:54:51,532 --> 00:54:54,331
-That's insane!
-I know. It's crazy, isn't it?

1081
00:54:54,370 --> 00:54:57,102
Uh, look,
this area is totally covered.

1082
00:54:57,141 --> 00:54:58,507
You can back off now.

1083
00:54:58,543 --> 00:55:01,173
No. I worked hard for this.
You back off.

1084
00:55:01,215 --> 00:55:03,514
Look, I don't have time
to fight with you, OK?

1085
00:55:03,551 --> 00:55:05,247
I don't want you to get hurt.

1086
00:55:05,288 --> 00:55:08,088
I don't need you to protect me.

1087
00:55:08,126 --> 00:55:09,924
-Fine.
-Fine.

1088
00:55:17,241 --> 00:55:19,768
PEGGY LEE SINGING:
Romeo loved Juliet

1089
00:55:19,812 --> 00:55:23,978
Juliet, she felt the same

1090
00:55:24,018 --> 00:55:27,285
When he put his arms
around her

1091
00:55:27,324 --> 00:55:29,521
[Whispering]

PAULIE: Huh? Huh?
I can't believe this shit.

1093
00:55:39,978 --> 00:55:41,309
What happened?

1094
00:55:41,347 --> 00:55:43,408
Down at the casino,
they caught...

1095
00:55:43,451 --> 00:55:45,113
a couple of chumps
with hidden cameras.

1096
00:55:45,153 --> 00:55:46,314
Who are they?

1097
00:55:46,356 --> 00:55:47,756

Whoa. Where do you think
you're goin'?

1111
00:56:38,140 --> 00:56:39,768
Into the underground casino.

1112
00:56:39,810 --> 00:56:41,676
I heard you have
excellent craps...

1113
00:56:41,712 --> 00:56:45,150
and I'm in a crappy mood,
so...heh heh heh.

1114
00:56:45,185 --> 00:56:48,179
-You can't go in there.
-Says who?

1115
00:56:50,226 --> 00:56:52,662
The lady said beat it!
Understand?

1116
00:56:52,697 --> 00:56:55,532
Oh...yes, sir.

1117
00:56:55,569 --> 00:56:57,663
That's a good little bitch.

1118
00:56:57,705 --> 00:56:59,298
Now bounce this jive-ass fool.

CORKY: Aah! Uhh.

1120
00:57:04,282 --> 00:57:07,310
It's gonna take
a heck of a lot more than that.

3 DOORS DOWN SINGING: I took
a walk around the world

1122

To ease my troubled mind

1123
00:57:12,330 --> 00:57:14,526
I left my body lying

00:57:14,566 --> 00:57:16,626
Somewhere
in the sands of time

1125

I was thinkin' about
makin' a move on her myself...

but, you know,
I can get another broad.

Say, Pete.

1188
01:01:15,928 --> 01:01:17,761
I haven't seen you
with a woman in a long time.

1189
01:01:17,798 --> 01:01:19,858
In fact, I don't think
I've ever seen you with a woman.

1190
01:01:20,970 --> 01:01:23,565
I just haven't found the right
filly yet, that's all.

1191
01:01:25,343 --> 01:01:26,936
Do you remember
when we were kids...

1192
01:01:26,979 --> 01:01:29,643
how we watched that Christmas
special about Rudolph...

1193
01:01:29,684 --> 01:01:31,916
and how Rudolph knew
he was secretly different...

1194
01:01:31,955 --> 01:01:33,217
from all the other reindeer?

1195
01:01:33,256 --> 01:01:35,158
And then, you know,
Rudolph tried to hide it...

1196
01:01:35,193 --> 01:01:36,661
but that just,
you know, ended up...

1197
01:01:36,696 --> 01:01:39,291
making Rudolph
angry and scared.

1198
01:01:39,333 --> 01:01:42,133
And then he met
Hermey the Elf, remember?

1199
01:01:42,171 --> 01:01:43,696
[High-pitched voice]
And he--he didn't--I didn't--

1200
01:01:43,740 --> 01:01:45,003
He didn't like to make toys.

1201
01:01:45,043 --> 01:01:48,310
And, uh, but that
actually made Rudolph...

1202
01:01:48,348 --> 01:01:51,581
feel like it was OK
to be different.

1203
01:01:51,620 --> 01:01:53,988
Do you remember that?

1204
01:01:54,024 --> 01:01:56,118
I don't have time
for this shit.

1205
01:02:22,204 --> 01:02:23,797

Heh heh. Kinda looks like me,
doesn't it? A little...

1210
01:02:39,465 --> 01:02:41,024
It's because it is you, Judas.

1211

Right in the belly
of the beast.

has been
sleeping with the enemy.

He's been stealing evidence
for the family the whole time.

1216
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:54,822
Well, it's not gonna happen.

1217
01:02:57,428 --> 01:02:59,124
I'm gonna make sure of that.

1218
01:03:02,770 --> 01:03:04,534
Pissant, is this true?

1219
01:03:06,209 --> 01:03:08,144
No, this is some--

1220
01:03:08,179 --> 01:03:09,909
This isn't me.
It's some postman.

1221
01:03:09,948 --> 01:03:12,384
-It's you.
-It's not.

1222
01:03:12,419 --> 01:03:13,580
-Yes, it is.
-Is not.

1223
01:03:13,621 --> 01:03:15,054
-It is you.
-Isn't!

1224
01:03:15,091 --> 01:03:16,753
-Yes, it is you.
-It's not me!

1225
01:03:16,793 --> 01:03:18,318
Knock it off, Davis!

1226
01:03:19,998 --> 01:03:22,399
Corky deserves a chance
to explain himself.

1227
01:03:22,435 --> 01:03:25,099
DA VIS: Knock it off?

1228
01:03:25,140 --> 01:03:28,236
You know, this buddy-buddy
shtick between you two...

1229
01:03:28,278 --> 01:03:30,406
is really starting
to wear thin.

1230
01:03:30,448 --> 01:03:31,848
What are you talking about?

1231
01:03:31,884 --> 01:03:33,318
DA VIS: You know damn well
what I'm talking about!

1232
01:03:33,353 --> 01:03:36,415
Pissant this and Pissant that.

1233
01:03:36,458 --> 01:03:38,655
"Hey, I got an idea.
Let's send Pissant."

1234
01:03:38,696 --> 01:03:41,461
Well, I'm sick ofhearing
about Pissant.

1235
01:03:41,500 --> 01:03:43,663
When's the last time
you talked about me?

1236
01:03:43,704 --> 01:03:44,933
When's the last time
you congratulated me...

1237
01:03:44,973 --> 01:03:46,999
on a hostage negotiation
situation?

1238
01:03:47,042 --> 01:03:52,312
Or said, "Hey, Davis, bang-up
job on that wiretap"? Hmm?

1239
01:03:52,351 --> 01:03:53,614
It's like I don't even exist.

1240
01:03:53,653 --> 01:03:56,419
-That's not true.
-Yes, it is!

1241
01:03:56,458 --> 01:03:58,860
The other day,
I wore my badge...

1242
01:03:58,896 --> 01:04:00,363
on the outside
of my left lapel...

1243
01:04:00,397 --> 01:04:02,026
just to see if you'd notice.

1244
01:04:02,067 --> 01:04:06,506
Did you notice?
No. I got nothin'.

1245
01:04:06,541 --> 01:04:08,841
I'm sorry.
Maybe I was a little bit busy.

1246
01:04:08,878 --> 01:04:11,644
Yeah! Talkin' about
how great Pissant is!

1247
01:04:11,683 --> 01:04:13,584
-[Door opens]
-[Knock on door]

1248
01:04:13,619 --> 01:04:16,317
Hey, Howard.
You wanted to see us?

1249
01:04:16,357 --> 01:04:18,223
Howard?!

1250
01:04:18,260 --> 01:04:21,163
What happened to "sir"?
It's "Mr. Shuster."

1251
01:04:21,199 --> 01:04:23,828
And what is
with those ridiculous ties?

1252
01:04:23,869 --> 01:04:27,273
It's this jiggling
little fruitcake, isn't it?

1253
01:04:27,309 --> 01:04:30,747
-Christ! Relax, Brick.
-It's Agent Davis.

1254
01:04:30,781 --> 01:04:33,274
SHUSTER:
He's right. Relax, Brick.

1255
01:04:37,225 --> 01:04:38,386
You're right.

1256
01:04:39,996 --> 01:04:41,726
I'm sorry...Howard.

1257
01:04:41,765 --> 01:04:43,427
That's Agent Shuster!

1258
01:04:43,468 --> 01:04:45,699
Oh, what? I can't call you
by your first name...

1259
01:04:45,738 --> 01:04:48,038
'cause I'm not a member
of the groovy tie squad?

1260
01:04:48,076 --> 01:04:49,806
No, it's because
you're an asshole.

1261
01:04:49,845 --> 01:04:51,279
I am not.

1262
01:04:51,314 --> 01:04:53,306
Yeah, you are.

1263
01:04:53,351 --> 01:04:56,049
Everyone thinks you are,
including your wife.

1264
01:04:56,089 --> 01:04:58,651
Why do you think she left you?

1265
01:04:58,693 --> 01:05:02,961
Well, her job relocated her
to Paris.

1266
01:05:03,001 --> 01:05:05,493
Bullshit. Right now
she's up in Kennebunkport...

1267
01:05:05,537 --> 01:05:07,403
gettin' poked
by some lobster fisherman.

1268
01:05:09,878 --> 01:05:12,313
-Aah!
-Come on, easy!

1269
01:05:12,348 --> 01:05:14,944
-You're dead!
-At ease!

1270
01:05:14,986 --> 01:05:17,354
[Yelling]

1271
01:05:17,391 --> 01:05:19,155
DA VIS: I'm gonna kill you!

1272
01:05:22,666 --> 01:05:23,793
[Gasps]

1273
01:05:23,834 --> 01:05:27,670
-Jesus, Corky, you scared me.
-Why are you still here?

1274
01:05:27,707 --> 01:05:30,143
I'm not leaving until
I get the old man on tape...

1275
01:05:30,178 --> 01:05:31,510
talking about murder.

1276
01:05:31,547 --> 01:05:34,518
Murder? I thought
we were trying to get him...

1277
01:05:34,552 --> 01:05:37,215
for gambling or tax evasion,
things like that.

1278
01:05:37,256 --> 01:05:40,159
No, that's nothing.
We wanna put him away for life.

1279
01:05:44,868 --> 01:05:47,134
[Sighs] Look...

1280
01:05:47,173 --> 01:05:48,505
this assignment is over, OK?

1281
01:05:48,542 --> 01:05:51,307
-You've gotta get out of here.
-No, I'm not done.

1282
01:05:51,346 --> 01:05:54,579
It's straight from Shuster.
You're through.

1283
01:06:33,481 --> 01:06:35,974
Well, I did it.
I got your evidence.

1284
01:06:36,019 --> 01:06:38,615
-You did?
-Yeah, only you know what?

1285
01:06:38,657 --> 01:06:40,057
I'm thinking about
giving it back.

1286
01:06:40,093 --> 01:06:41,721
-What?
-Kidnapping?

1287
01:06:41,762 --> 01:06:44,561
And--and--and--and murder?

1288
01:06:44,599 --> 01:06:46,831
What did you--what did you--
what did you think...

1289
01:06:46,870 --> 01:06:48,736
that I just wasn't
gonna figure it out?

1290
01:06:48,773 --> 01:06:51,539
Corky, I've been involved
in my share ofscams...

1291
01:06:51,578 --> 01:06:53,706
but I never done
none of those things.

1292
01:06:53,748 --> 01:06:56,344
That's bullshit.
You gotta believe me.

1293
01:06:56,386 --> 01:06:58,287
Why?
Why would I believe you?

1294
01:06:58,322 --> 01:07:02,091
I swear on your mother's eyes
I never done those things.

1295
01:07:02,129 --> 01:07:03,323
Where did you get this?

1296
01:07:03,363 --> 01:07:06,129
It's right--
It's here...in...

1297
01:07:06,168 --> 01:07:07,761
I don't know
specifically where...

1298
01:07:07,804 --> 01:07:10,172
but it's here
in the sworn testimony.

1299
01:07:10,209 --> 01:07:12,440
Pops, check out
the caldones on this broad.

1300
01:07:12,479 --> 01:07:14,915
Testimony?

1301
01:07:14,950 --> 01:07:18,183
Testimony by who?

1302
01:07:18,222 --> 01:07:20,692
Testimony?
You got the evidence?

1303
01:07:20,726 --> 01:07:23,525
Hey, Petey,
he got the evidence!

1304
01:07:36,986 --> 01:07:38,921
Good job, kid.

1305
01:07:38,955 --> 01:07:42,051
Yeah, I knew you had
the grapes for it.

1306
01:07:42,094 --> 01:07:43,960
Tell you what,
I'll get rid of this.

1307
01:07:43,997 --> 01:07:45,192
CORKY: Wait a minute.

1308
01:07:45,232 --> 01:07:47,167
Not until I get
some answers here...

1309
01:07:47,202 --> 01:07:49,695
'cause there are some serious
accusations in this file.

1310
01:07:49,740 --> 01:07:51,538
Please, Corky, since when
do you give a damn...

1311
01:07:51,576 --> 01:07:53,408
about anything having to do
with this family?

1312
01:07:53,445 --> 01:07:55,847
Corky, let the adults talk.
Come here.

1313
01:07:55,883 --> 01:07:59,048
Now, you done a good job.
You got the evidence...

1314
01:07:59,088 --> 01:08:03,391
but you don't belong here,
so go home.

1315
01:08:17,452 --> 01:08:20,047
PAULIE: Oh, yeah! We are
back in business, fellas.

1316
01:08:20,090 --> 01:08:22,116
-Pops is back.
-I'll drink to that!

1317
01:08:30,106 --> 01:08:32,736
MEN: Ha ha ha ha!

1318
01:08:38,720 --> 01:08:40,313
PETER: Let's talk about...

1319
01:08:40,356 --> 01:08:42,258
What are you still doin' here?

1320
01:08:42,293 --> 01:08:44,819
Don't you got some puppies
to breastfeed?

1321
01:08:44,863 --> 01:08:47,425
I'm not going anywhere
until I'm damn well ready...

1322
01:08:47,468 --> 01:08:49,938
'cause I am sick
of being your lapdog.

1323
01:08:49,972 --> 01:08:52,874
Ooh, the other sister's
standing up for herself.

1324
01:08:54,145 --> 01:08:57,173
Ooh! Hey! Ow! Oh!

1325
01:08:57,217 --> 01:09:00,849
I'm as much a part of this
family as either one of you.

1326
01:09:00,890 --> 01:09:03,952
I put my life on the line.
I kept Pops out of jail.

1327
01:09:03,995 --> 01:09:05,588
I paid my dues.

1328
01:09:05,631 --> 01:09:09,000
Now you start showing me
a little goddamn respect!

1329
01:09:09,037 --> 01:09:10,528
PAULIE: All right!

1330
01:09:10,572 --> 01:09:13,167
You're a part of this family.
Now get off of me.

1331
01:09:15,213 --> 01:09:16,977
You wanna try that with me,
you little pussy?

1332
01:09:18,485 --> 01:09:20,681
Don't you touch him!

1333
01:09:20,722 --> 01:09:22,588
Pops, you're gonna get excited.

1334
01:09:22,626 --> 01:09:25,095
Shut up.
I'm already excited.

1335
01:09:25,129 --> 01:09:26,757
Now leave your brother alone.

1336
01:09:26,799 --> 01:09:30,066
Oh, sure, Pops. Take his side.
You always do take his side.

1337
01:09:30,104 --> 01:09:31,697
What are you talkin' about?

1338
01:09:31,740 --> 01:09:33,106
PAULIE:
You sent him to college.

1339
01:09:33,142 --> 01:09:34,440
You never sent me to college.

1340
01:09:34,478 --> 01:09:37,415
You showed that nurse more
respect than you showed me!

1341
01:09:37,450 --> 01:09:40,717
I saw you teachin' her
how to read!

1342
01:09:40,755 --> 01:09:42,951
You never taught me
how to read!

1343
01:09:42,992 --> 01:09:46,395
Which is why I still don't know
how to read!

1344
01:09:46,431 --> 01:09:47,865
POPS:
Don't be ridiculous.

1345
01:09:47,900 --> 01:09:49,197
Of course
you know how to read.

1346
01:09:49,236 --> 01:09:51,671
I see you with magazines
all the time--

1347
01:09:51,706 --> 01:09:54,871
Penthouse, Swank, Hustler.

1348
01:09:58,651 --> 01:10:01,884
Oh, shit.

1349
01:10:01,923 --> 01:10:03,323
PAULIE: You remember
that--that time...

1350
01:10:03,359 --> 01:10:05,328
I got arrested
at Tony Roma's...

1351
01:10:05,362 --> 01:10:07,490
for exposing myself
in the ladies' room?

1352
01:10:07,532 --> 01:10:10,332
I thought
it was the men's room!

1353
01:10:10,370 --> 01:10:12,430
And what about
the time that Uncle Leo...

1354
01:10:12,473 --> 01:10:14,466
sent me to the store
for a carton of marlboros...

1355
01:10:14,511 --> 01:10:18,643
and I come back with a--
with a carton of tampons?

1356
01:10:18,683 --> 01:10:20,812
Feminine products!

1357
01:10:20,854 --> 01:10:23,517
You thought it was funny,
right?

1358
01:10:23,558 --> 01:10:26,324
I was upstairs in my room
crying.

1359
01:10:28,166 --> 01:10:29,999
Don't stare at me like
I'm some kind of a freak...

1360
01:10:30,036 --> 01:10:31,367
because I'll tell you
all something else.

1361
01:10:31,404 --> 01:10:32,804
He's a homo.

1362
01:10:39,083 --> 01:10:41,645
No, I'm not, Pops.

1363
01:10:41,688 --> 01:10:43,816
Huh...l'm not--
I love boobies.

1364
01:10:43,858 --> 01:10:46,988
Oh, bullshit! You got
a collection of mesh tank tops.

1365
01:10:47,030 --> 01:10:49,557
You got a poster of
Matthew Perry in your bedroom.

1366
01:10:49,601 --> 01:10:52,538
You got Divas Live on DVD,
for Christ's sakes.

1367
01:10:52,573 --> 01:10:54,565
You are one big faggot.

1368
01:10:54,609 --> 01:10:57,079
Well, at least I can read
the labels, you illiterate mook!

1369
01:10:57,113 --> 01:10:58,911
Take it back, you fruit loop.

1370
01:10:58,950 --> 01:11:01,010
You want me to learn you
how to spell "dead man"?

1371
01:11:01,053 --> 01:11:03,922
-How 'bout some of this, then?
-How 'bout this, eh?

1372
01:11:03,958 --> 01:11:07,692
Stop it! Just stop it.

1373
01:11:07,731 --> 01:11:09,495
"Ooh, help me, I'm gay."

1374
01:11:09,534 --> 01:11:11,901
"Ooh, I can't read."

1375
01:11:11,937 --> 01:11:13,235
I don't care how gay you are...

1376
01:11:13,273 --> 01:11:15,641
and I don't care
how stupid you are.

1377
01:11:15,677 --> 01:11:18,876
Get over it! OK?

1378
01:11:18,916 --> 01:11:21,010
Get over it.

1379
01:11:22,154 --> 01:11:23,554
Huh?

1380
01:11:26,395 --> 01:11:29,525

1385
01:11:39,449 --> 01:11:40,747
I need to speak
to my father...

1386
01:11:42,254 --> 01:11:43,380
alone.

1387
01:11:43,423 --> 01:11:45,915

I never thought I would,
either.

01:11:58,714 --> 01:12:00,946
You know what
you looked like just now?

1393
01:12:00,985 --> 01:12:03,477
Your mother.

1394
01:12:03,522 --> 01:12:07,359
Your mother was the glue
that held this family together.

1395
01:12:07,395 --> 01:12:09,523
You got the same instincts.

1396
01:12:09,565 --> 01:12:12,365
I see a lot of her in you.

1397
01:12:18,680 --> 01:12:21,344
-Is that why you sent me away?
-You know what?

1398
01:12:21,385 --> 01:12:24,720
I sent you away
because I love you.

1399

You're not cut out
for this business.

You're cut out
for something better.

1401

And you proved that.

1402
01:12:33,839 --> 01:12:35,330
I just wanted to be
part of the family...

1403
01:12:35,375 --> 01:12:36,843
just on my own terms.

1404
01:12:36,877 --> 01:12:40,212
You are part of the family.

1405
01:12:40,249 --> 01:12:42,718
You're my son.

1406
01:12:58,345 --> 01:13:00,941
For what it's worth, I believe
you didn't do those things.

1407
01:13:00,983 --> 01:13:03,215

He's gone, Leo.

1413
01:13:39,112 --> 01:13:43,347
His last words, Leo,
he was calling out for you.

1414
01:13:45,388 --> 01:13:47,654
Now's your chance
to make your peace.

1415
01:13:54,737 --> 01:13:56,798
Why would Pissant
steal the evidence?

1416

DA VIS: He's been in bed
with 'em since day one.

I just hope
he hasn't killed Russo yet.

God, I haven't been
on a raid in ten years.

I may be a liar,
and I may be a coward...

1423
01:14:23,218 --> 01:14:27,179
but all I ever wanted was
a shot at running the business.

1424
01:14:29,127 --> 01:14:33,362
I'm sorry I gave you
a heart attack, you old jerk.

1425
01:14:33,401 --> 01:14:36,099
I just wanted you
out of the way.

Oh!

But I swear to God, pop,
if you were alive right now...

1428
01:14:42,683 --> 01:14:45,848
I'd tell the feds that none
of the shit I said was true.

And now you're going
to arrest me?

So what are you?
A fed or one of them?

01:15:28,859 --> 01:15:32,820
CORKY: I'm one of them.
I was pretending to be a fed.

1445
01:15:32,865 --> 01:15:35,301
Because?

1446
01:15:35,336 --> 01:15:36,770
Because I didn't think
my father...

deserved to die injail.
