You couldn't pick me up
a little closer?

00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:52,572
You look like GI Joe.

37
00:03:52,605 --> 00:03:54,540
The fuck?
You're one to talk, emo kid.

38
00:03:54,874 --> 00:03:58,711
Dude, my plan was
to go to Keats's house,

39
00:03:58,744 --> 00:04:01,747
not the forest.
Like, what are you wearing?

40
00:04:01,781 --> 00:04:03,516
- You look like an idiot.
- Your plan? [scoffs]

41
00:04:03,549 --> 00:04:05,451
It's not your plan.
First of all,

42
00:04:05,485 --> 00:04:07,587
I planned this
for the past 10 years.

43
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:09,522
I don't even know what
Brigit saw in you.

44
00:04:09,555 --> 00:04:10,690
Get in the car.

45
00:04:11,257 --> 00:04:12,758
Yeah, it's not your plan.

- What's this?
- My ashtray.

47
00:04:20,366 --> 00:04:21,801
What are you smoking
three packs a day?

48
00:04:21,834 --> 00:04:23,736
That ain't gonna be
what kills me.

00:04:39,084 --> 00:04:40,319
Get out, I'm driving.

My truck, my rules.

52
00:04:41,921 --> 00:04:43,823
[Toby] Last time you tried
to drive me anywhere,

53
00:04:43,856 --> 00:04:45,825
you try to take me
to a mental institution,

54
00:04:45,858 --> 00:04:47,493
so I don't trust you.

55
00:04:47,527 --> 00:04:49,328
- Good morning, Toby.
- Fuck you.

56
00:04:50,161 --> 00:04:50,997
Prick.

57
00:04:51,029 --> 00:04:53,198
[Toby]
I still think this is a bad idea

58
00:04:53,232 --> 00:04:54,600
that we waited for him
all this time.

59
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:57,270
Everything shit
that happened to Brigit

60
00:04:57,303 --> 00:04:59,070
happened after she got with him.

61
00:04:59,505 --> 00:05:03,074
Now, I ain't getting in
this truck unless I'm driving.

62
00:05:03,108 --> 00:05:05,745
Fine! Christ Almighty
on a broken rocking horse.

It is too early for your crazy.

64
00:05:08,213 --> 00:05:10,650
Get out. Get out!

65
00:05:12,785 --> 00:05:14,453
Thank you, little sister.

66
00:05:15,821 --> 00:05:17,122
[Grace] Oh, my God.

67
00:05:18,324 --> 00:05:20,125
I was listening to a preacher
this morning on the radio

68
00:05:20,158 --> 00:05:23,729
and he said the word "sinner"
six times in six minutes.

69
00:05:23,763 --> 00:05:25,331
You know what that means?

70
00:05:26,766 --> 00:05:28,768
I mean it's gonna be
a glorious day.

71
00:05:32,872 --> 00:05:33,773
[Roy] Give me the gun.

72
00:05:36,475 --> 00:05:37,476
Don't hurt yourself.

Someone's here! Someone's here!

82
00:06:28,794 --> 00:06:29,795

[both grunting]

87
00:06:48,814 --> 00:06:50,516
Does it look like
she needs help?

90
00:07:09,869 --> 00:07:10,936
Fuck, door's sealed.

91
00:07:17,843 --> 00:07:19,311
[Grace] Hey, asshole.

92
00:07:20,112 --> 00:07:21,414
I can give you
anything you want.

93
00:07:21,747 --> 00:07:23,015
Oh, I think I know what you got.

94
00:07:23,049 --> 00:07:25,818
The only thing you're guilty of
right now is just trespassing.

95
00:07:25,851 --> 00:07:27,653
Nah, I killed that guard
back there.

96
00:07:30,356 --> 00:07:32,558
[Roy] Keats has a guard?
Why does Keats have guard?

97
00:07:32,591 --> 00:07:34,694
And his boys are packing
some real firepower.

98
00:07:34,727 --> 00:07:36,962
That's military spec,
right there.

99
00:07:36,996 --> 00:07:38,864
Grace never mentioned anything
about a fucking guard.

100
00:07:39,065 --> 00:07:40,766
I knew he was hidin' something.

101
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,668
[gunshot]

102
00:07:45,337 --> 00:07:46,872
You leave right now,
I swear I won't tell a soul.

103
00:07:46,906 --> 00:07:47,907
I won't say a word.

104
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:50,876
You can answer a question for us
and we'll be on our way.

105
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:52,278
[Keats] Yes, anything.

106
00:07:53,646 --> 00:07:54,947
What happened to Brigit Baker?

107
00:07:55,748 --> 00:07:58,517
You were the last person
to see her alive.

108
00:07:59,051 --> 00:08:00,218
House is clear.

109
00:08:01,654 --> 00:08:04,523
See, I told you
this Ayn Rand-lovin',

110
00:08:04,557 --> 00:08:06,292
Epstein-wannabe
is hiding something.

111
00:08:06,325 --> 00:08:07,660
[Keats] It's just my safe room..

112
00:08:07,893 --> 00:08:08,894
Fucking open it.

113
00:08:10,029 --> 00:08:11,864
Fuck the door! I want to know
what you did to Brigit.

114
00:08:12,431 --> 00:08:14,700
[Keats] You can still go.
I didn't press the silent alarm.

115
00:08:14,734 --> 00:08:15,801
Go ahead, push it.

116
00:08:17,636 --> 00:08:19,905
You want me to trip the alarm?

117
00:08:19,939 --> 00:08:22,475
Yes we do, Doctor Keats.

118
00:08:22,508 --> 00:08:25,344
I'm not leaving here,
but you can.

119
00:08:26,011 --> 00:08:26,812
Push the button.

120
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,381
[Grace]
Don't make him repeat himself.

121
00:08:29,849 --> 00:08:31,684
Let's get the whole town
in on the fun.

122

[doorbell rings]

123
00:08:33,085 --> 00:08:34,386
[woman]
Here's your baker's dozen.

124
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:35,621
[Kyle] How we doing, sweetheart?

125
00:08:35,654 --> 00:08:37,823
- [woman] Cash or credit?
- [Kyle] Hold on.

126
00:08:42,595 --> 00:08:43,696
What are we working with?

127
00:08:44,864 --> 00:08:45,831
This'll do.

128
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,769
- [woman] Thanks.
- [Kyle tuts]

129
00:08:50,369 --> 00:08:51,403
Hold on.

130
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:57,009
[woman] Okay, bye.

131
00:08:59,078 --> 00:09:01,447
- [doorbell rings]
- You forgot your gun.

132
00:09:03,349 --> 00:09:04,383
[Kyle] Oh, hell.

133
00:09:11,957 --> 00:09:13,526
[woman]
All right, see you later.

134
00:09:13,993 --> 00:09:15,895

137
00:09:32,711 --> 00:09:33,913
- Hey.
- [grunts]

138
00:09:35,848 --> 00:09:37,049
I thought you were dead.

139
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:38,818
Get up.

140
00:09:39,552 --> 00:09:41,587
- It's time to get up.
- You could...

141
00:09:41,954 --> 00:09:44,456
- You could sit in my lap.
- [Marisa] Oh.

142
00:09:46,058 --> 00:09:49,895
I don't know if it could,
you know, hold both of us.

143
00:09:51,797 --> 00:09:52,798
Come on.

144
00:09:53,465 --> 00:09:55,935

147
00:10:04,109 --> 00:10:05,312
Let's go.

148
00:10:05,744 --> 00:10:07,546
- Gotta go.
- Let's have a snow day.

149
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:09,648
- Nobody cares, Boy Scout.
- [Ben grumbles]

150
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:13,018
- [horn honks]
- [mutters] Here, oh, yes.

151
00:10:14,987 --> 00:10:16,822
Let's roll, old man.
I got donuts.

152
00:10:16,856 --> 00:10:18,023
- [both chuckling]
- The other one.

153
00:10:20,693 --> 00:10:22,494
- [can opens]
- Woo!

154
00:10:26,432 --> 00:10:27,499
Mm.

155
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,501
You boys have fun out there.

156
00:10:30,035 --> 00:10:31,036
[Kyle] Christ, Chief.

157
00:10:31,737 --> 00:10:33,572
At least act like
you give a shit.

158
00:10:33,973 --> 00:10:34,974
Let's go.

159
00:10:48,821 --> 00:10:49,955
What's cooking?

160
00:10:50,656 --> 00:10:52,892
I just gotta go
to the kindergarten at 11,

161
00:10:52,925 --> 00:10:55,494
talk to the kids about
being a hero and all that.

162
00:10:57,630 --> 00:10:58,964
Nah, I wish.

163
00:11:00,199 --> 00:11:01,834
Let's go see your daddy.

164
00:11:02,501 --> 00:11:03,802
I need a word.

165
00:11:05,037 --> 00:11:06,872
Let's make it a surprise.

166
00:11:07,806 --> 00:11:09,408
My daddy don't like surprises.

[kick thuds]

181
00:12:40,233 --> 00:12:42,001
The '66 was better.

182
00:12:44,169 --> 00:12:45,671
- [gunshot]
- [clay shatters]

183
00:12:45,704 --> 00:12:46,972
Morning, Daddy.

184
00:12:48,941 --> 00:12:50,075
[gun clicks]

185
00:12:54,213 --> 00:12:55,581
[Charles] What's wrong?

186
00:12:56,915 --> 00:12:58,584
Maybe we just
want to come say hello.

187
00:13:00,019 --> 00:13:01,020
[woman over radio]
<i>Deputy Rutledge,</i>

188
00:13:01,053 --> 00:13:03,188
<i>Deputy Rutledge,
you got eyes on Sheriff Ben?</i>

189
00:13:04,357 --> 00:13:05,291
[Kyle] Yeah, I'm here.

190
00:13:05,325 --> 00:13:06,725
[woman] <i>Silent alarm
was just tripped</i>

191
00:13:06,759 --> 00:13:07,793
<i>at Doctor Keats's house.</i>

192
00:13:08,127 --> 00:13:09,628
<i>Probably him just
knocking it again,</i>

193
00:13:09,661 --> 00:13:11,730
<i>but when I called the house,
he didn't answer.</i>

194
00:13:11,764 --> 00:13:14,166
- <i>Copy?</i>
- One of his maids again.

195
00:13:15,301 --> 00:13:18,271
Get Marisa to, you know,
to head over.

196
00:13:18,737 --> 00:13:20,839
She ain't gonna be happy,
it's her day off.

197
00:13:22,007 --> 00:13:23,742
Yeah, Aggie, we got it.

198
00:13:23,776 --> 00:13:25,144
We're gonna handle it.
Thank you.

199
00:13:28,914 --> 00:13:30,015
Deputy Marisa.

200
00:13:33,286 --> 00:13:34,620
[Kyle over radio]
<i>Deputy Marisa?</i>

201
00:13:36,021 --> 00:13:37,022
What?

202
00:13:37,524 --> 00:13:39,925
I'm requesting a 89
at the residence

203
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:41,693
of one Doctor John Keats.

204
00:13:42,628 --> 00:13:43,562
1403...

205
00:13:43,595 --> 00:13:44,997
[Marisa over radio]
<i>Are you kidding me?</i>

206
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:46,165
<i>It's my day off.</i>

207
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:49,802
Deputy,
crime don't take days off.

208
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:52,204
[Marisa] <i>One of his maids must
have hit it with her ass.</i>

209
00:13:53,138 --> 00:13:54,139
'Preciate it, Deputy.

210
00:13:57,843 --> 00:13:59,178
- [clattering]
- Oop!

211
00:14:03,816 --> 00:14:05,050
Problem handled.

212
00:14:06,685 --> 00:14:11,723
Delegated. That's the word
you're looking for, delegated.

213
00:14:13,259 --> 00:14:14,260
What you want, Ben?

214
00:14:15,727 --> 00:14:17,062
I've been doing some math.

215
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:19,031
[Charles] There you go, son.

216
00:14:22,302 --> 00:14:24,870
I saw this real nice boat.

217
00:14:25,438 --> 00:14:27,840
A schooner in, uh, Jacksonville.

218
00:14:30,443 --> 00:14:32,010
Hand me a water, would you?

219
00:14:34,179 --> 00:14:35,281
[Kyle] Pull.

220
00:14:35,315 --> 00:14:37,082
[machine clatters]

221
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:39,385
[gunshot]

222
00:14:41,321 --> 00:14:42,355
- Thank you.
- There you go.

223
00:14:44,756 --> 00:14:45,757
[Kyle] Pull.

224
00:14:47,393 --> 00:14:49,194
[gunshot]

225
00:14:52,064 --> 00:14:53,732
[Charles] Why don't you try
hitting one, son?

226
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:56,336
Those shells are expensive.

227
00:14:57,202 --> 00:14:58,304
Sorry, Pa.

228
00:14:59,004 --> 00:15:02,040
[Ben] He always said
he takes after his mother.

229
00:15:02,542 --> 00:15:05,378
She'd be rolling in her grave
she saw him shoot like that.

230
00:15:06,044 --> 00:15:07,112
[chuckles]

231
00:15:09,148 --> 00:15:10,182
How much?

232
00:15:11,783 --> 00:15:12,784
50.

233
00:15:16,188 --> 00:15:17,222
30'll cover it.

234
00:15:19,191 --> 00:15:20,393
Thank you.

235
00:15:22,262 --> 00:15:24,763
Drop by the house tonight,
I'll have it for you.

236
00:15:25,498 --> 00:15:27,400
- [Kyle] Pull.
- [machine clanks]

237
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:30,336
[gunshot]

238
00:15:32,372 --> 00:15:33,373
[Toby] Get in there.

239
00:15:33,739 --> 00:15:36,074
- Get...
- [Keats] Easy. Easy!

240
00:15:36,376 --> 00:15:37,310
- [Toby] Sit down.
- Easy.

241
00:15:40,045 --> 00:15:42,415
- [Toby] You okay, little sis?
- Always.

242
00:15:44,417 --> 00:15:46,486
What you hiding
behind that door, huh?

243
00:15:46,519 --> 00:15:48,153
You the Black El Chapo

244
00:15:48,187 --> 00:15:49,255
or you running
a [indistinct] sex cult

245
00:15:49,289 --> 00:15:51,424
sending in the blood of virgins
to the ultra rich?

246
00:15:51,457 --> 00:15:52,958
You watch
too much YouTube, Toby.

247
00:15:52,991 --> 00:15:54,860
Doctor Keats ain't
sellin' virgin blood.

248
00:15:54,893 --> 00:15:57,397
[indistinct] society's
a real thing, Grace.

249
00:15:58,498 --> 00:16:00,165
What's taking the sheriff
so long?

250
00:16:00,567 --> 00:16:01,900
T, give me his phone.

251
00:16:03,336 --> 00:16:04,404
They don't let me have a phone

252
00:16:04,437 --> 00:16:06,239
who don't let you have a phone?

253
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,740
I've already said too much.

254
00:16:09,342 --> 00:16:10,909
[Roy] T, give me your phone.

255
00:16:12,077 --> 00:16:13,145
Do you think I'm dumb?

256
00:16:13,446 --> 00:16:15,214
I didn't bring my phone,
they could track me.

257
00:16:15,248 --> 00:16:17,115
- Grace.
- All right.

258
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:26,858
[line ringing]

259
00:16:33,932 --> 00:16:36,469
You ain't never tied
anybody to a chair before?

260
00:16:36,502 --> 00:16:38,971
- That's not how you do it.
- What, you want Roy to do it?

261
00:16:42,442 --> 00:16:46,178
[woman speaking indistinctly
over PA]

262
00:16:51,251 --> 00:16:52,884
[phone ringing]

263
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:55,555
Albany Federal Bureau
of Investigations.

264
00:16:55,588 --> 00:16:56,356
How can I help?

265
00:16:59,459 --> 00:17:00,759
[phone vibrating]

266
00:17:06,566 --> 00:17:08,900
[woman speaking indistinctly
over phone]

267
00:17:10,236 --> 00:17:11,471
Say that again.

268
00:17:11,504 --> 00:17:13,872
I have one Roy Lambert
on the other line,

269
00:17:14,206 --> 00:17:16,509
he says
he's taken John Keats hostage.

270
00:17:17,443 --> 00:17:19,345
What a horrendous prank.

271
00:17:20,045 --> 00:17:21,581
[woman] <i>It doesn't sound like
a prank, sir.</i>

272
00:17:21,614 --> 00:17:22,615
[door opens]

273
00:17:22,649 --> 00:17:26,852
Hey, Daddy. Yeah,
my friends are on their way.

274
00:17:27,052 --> 00:17:28,488
<i>You're gonna see 'em
real soon.</i>

275
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:31,156
They'll be there in
just a minute, don't you worry.

276
00:17:31,823 --> 00:17:33,359
Brass will take care of it.

277
00:17:33,892 --> 00:17:35,961
[woman]
<i>Sir, we have to roll the unit.</i>

278
00:17:35,994 --> 00:17:38,830
Hostage situations are federal,
it's protocol.

279
00:17:38,864 --> 00:17:40,566
[Charles over phone] <i>Perhaps
you never got the call.</i>

280
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,134
It's already been logged.

281
00:17:44,337 --> 00:17:45,505
Where they coming from?

282
00:17:45,837 --> 00:17:48,374
Albany.
That's an hour to Fitzgerald.

283
00:17:48,675 --> 00:17:51,411
If they get there and sense
there's anything in that house,

284
00:17:51,444 --> 00:17:53,279
<i>they will come in
and they will find it.</i>

285
00:17:54,179 --> 00:17:55,515
An hour.

286
00:17:56,948 --> 00:17:58,518
Stall 'em as long as you can.

287
00:17:59,585 --> 00:18:00,453
Mm-hm.

288
00:18:02,522 --> 00:18:03,523
Who was that?

289
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:07,293
Someone we pay
to keep us informed.

290
00:18:08,528 --> 00:18:10,463
Roy Lambert's out of prison?

291
00:18:12,465 --> 00:18:14,166
Go start the truck, son.

292
00:18:24,544 --> 00:18:26,044
Shoulda killed him.

293
00:18:27,079 --> 00:18:28,314
Can you clean this up?

294
00:18:30,082 --> 00:18:31,183
How clean?

295
00:18:32,285 --> 00:18:33,619
Don't have to be squeaky.

296
00:18:35,288 --> 00:18:37,989
- Doctor Keats?
- [Charles] Alive.

297
00:18:38,924 --> 00:18:42,094
Can't lose Doctor Keats,
you know that, right?

298
00:18:42,595 --> 00:18:44,196
He's the best at what he does.

299
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:48,200
I should send in Silas.

300
00:18:48,234 --> 00:18:50,269
No, no, you don't wanna do that.

301
00:18:51,671 --> 00:18:52,971
Let me try.

302
00:18:53,506 --> 00:18:55,408
Well, Silas can get this done.

303
00:18:55,708 --> 00:18:57,075
[Ben] You want discreet?

304
00:18:57,577 --> 00:18:59,312
That's why I'm here.

305
00:19:02,948 --> 00:19:03,949
[Charles] All right.

306
00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:07,185
You get a shot at Roy,
you're gonna take it, right?

307
00:19:08,287 --> 00:19:09,221
Yes, sir.

308
00:19:09,255 --> 00:19:11,491
[woman over radio]
<i>FBI is 55 minutes out.</i>

309
00:19:11,524 --> 00:19:13,459
[Kyle]
Call just went out on the radio.

310
00:19:16,027 --> 00:19:17,463
You contain this.

311
00:19:19,665 --> 00:19:21,967
[tense music]

312
00:19:57,336 --> 00:19:58,404
[Roy whispers] Thank God.

313
00:20:13,553 --> 00:20:15,555
Let's try some diplomacy.

314
00:20:22,328 --> 00:20:24,263
- Grace, give me a rifle.
- [Grace] Why?

315
00:20:24,297 --> 00:20:26,365
The sheriff is here.
Give me a rifle, come on.

316
00:20:26,899 --> 00:20:30,101
- A big one.
- [scoffs] You get what you get.

317
00:20:32,271 --> 00:20:34,973
- I'm gonna do the talking.
- That's all you do.

318
00:20:36,542 --> 00:20:37,443
[Toby] Hey, Keats.

319
00:20:37,477 --> 00:20:40,480
Tell me, how does
a small-town pharmacist

320
00:20:40,513 --> 00:20:42,248
afford a place like this, huh?

321
00:20:42,748 --> 00:20:43,549
I'm frugal.

322
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:46,017
Bullshit.

323
00:20:46,051 --> 00:20:48,019
My family's lived in this house
for 85 years

324
00:20:48,053 --> 00:20:49,689
until you uppity animals
barged in.

325
00:20:49,722 --> 00:20:50,523
Shut the hell up.

326
00:20:50,556 --> 00:20:52,558
Bet the farm
you don't see sundown.

327
00:20:56,662 --> 00:20:58,664
[music continues]

328
00:20:58,698 --> 00:21:01,367
- [button clicks]
- [rifle laser sight powers up]

329
00:21:08,674 --> 00:21:09,742
That's far enough, Ben.

330
00:21:12,745 --> 00:21:16,649
Can we pretend for a moment
that we're civilized?

331
00:21:19,719 --> 00:21:21,787
I need proof of life.

332
00:21:24,457 --> 00:21:25,591
Doctor.

333
00:21:26,224 --> 00:21:27,360
You well?

334
00:21:27,393 --> 00:21:28,794
That's a stupid question
considerin' the circumstance,

335
00:21:28,828 --> 00:21:30,061
you drunk bastard.

336
00:21:30,563 --> 00:21:31,631
Tell them I'll pay them
whatever they want.

337
00:21:31,664 --> 00:21:33,799
- [Roy] Shut the fuck up.
- It's all about the money

338
00:21:33,833 --> 00:21:34,634
with you people.

339
00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:39,605
I thought you were
in the big house.

340
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,073
Got out a few hours ago.

341
00:21:42,107 --> 00:21:43,376
You hurt anyone yet?

342
00:21:43,676 --> 00:21:45,611
Yep, and the day is still young.

343
00:21:46,612 --> 00:21:48,281
You want to negotiate, kid?

344
00:21:48,681 --> 00:21:51,149
Money? Reparations?

345
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:53,619
How about a nice gin and tonic?

346
00:21:55,254 --> 00:21:56,656
Sounds pretty good, doesn't it?

347
00:21:56,689 --> 00:21:58,424
[Roy] Where's your
hometown spirit, Ben?

348
00:21:59,224 --> 00:22:03,629
I know you know exactly
who to ask to get what we want.

349
00:22:03,663 --> 00:22:06,265
- Which is?
- The answer to one question.

350
00:22:06,532 --> 00:22:08,501
Who the fuck killed my sister?

351
00:22:09,535 --> 00:22:10,636
I investigated.

352
00:22:11,737 --> 00:22:13,406
She went missing.

353
00:22:13,439 --> 00:22:15,140
She probably went to Atlanta.

354
00:22:15,608 --> 00:22:17,843
Yeah, got mixed up
in a bad scene.

355
00:22:17,877 --> 00:22:20,713
My sister wasn't no junkie.
She would never just run off.

356
00:22:21,247 --> 00:22:24,182
The last time she was seen,
she was coming here,

357
00:22:24,717 --> 00:22:26,285
to Doctor Keats's house.

358
00:22:26,852 --> 00:22:28,287
So here's what's what.

359
00:22:28,321 --> 00:22:30,323
You have 30 minutes to solve

360
00:22:30,356 --> 00:22:31,557
the disappearance
of Brigit Baker.

361
00:22:31,591 --> 00:22:32,825
Or?

362
00:22:32,858 --> 00:22:34,860
Or I start sending out
John Keats piece by piece

363
00:22:34,894 --> 00:22:36,429
until you got him all.

364
00:22:36,462 --> 00:22:37,663
[Ben]
So let me get this straight.

365
00:22:37,930 --> 00:22:40,800
If you don't hear
what you don't want to hear,

366
00:22:41,434 --> 00:22:43,703
then you're going to
shoot Doctor Keats.

367
00:22:44,337 --> 00:22:46,137
- [Roy] That's right.
- [Ben chuckles]

368
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,910
It took all three of you
to come up with that?

369
00:22:50,943 --> 00:22:52,578
Call the FBI,

370
00:22:52,612 --> 00:22:54,680
get every Leo in the state here,

371
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,782
or I kill my number one suspect.

372
00:22:56,816 --> 00:22:58,651
- No, Roy.
- Yes, Ben.

373
00:22:58,951 --> 00:23:00,920
30 minutes, three-zero,

374
00:23:00,953 --> 00:23:03,389
or I start asking Doctor Keats
the truth.

375
00:23:03,856 --> 00:23:05,791
And if he doesn't answer?

376
00:23:05,825 --> 00:23:07,927
I put a gun to his head
and I ask him again.

377
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,795
And if he still doesn't answer?

378
00:23:09,829 --> 00:23:11,263
[Roy] It's a small town.

379
00:23:11,597 --> 00:23:14,800
She's got a lot of bullets.
Someone's gonna talk.

380
00:23:15,568 --> 00:23:18,738
This started 10 years ago,
but it ends today.

381
00:23:24,744 --> 00:23:26,912
[tense music]

382
00:23:36,722 --> 00:23:38,591
What in God's name
possessed them to do this?

383
00:23:39,157 --> 00:23:40,760
[Ben] They're here for Brigit.

384
00:23:41,594 --> 00:23:43,496
- Who?
- Brigit Baker.

385
00:23:47,466 --> 00:23:49,835
We should smoke 'em out
right now before they dig in.

386
00:23:50,903 --> 00:23:52,203
Fuck.

387
00:23:53,639 --> 00:23:54,640
Yeah.

388
00:23:57,309 --> 00:23:58,711
[clearing throat]

389
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:02,515
[Ben over radio] <i>Deputy Lewis.</i>

390
00:24:04,383 --> 00:24:05,918
<i>Deputy Lewis, are you on?</i>

391
00:24:07,753 --> 00:24:09,789
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, what's up?

392
00:24:10,389 --> 00:24:13,693
Thanks for doing that welfare
check on Doctor Keats.

393
00:24:13,893 --> 00:24:15,895
No problem, no problem.

394
00:24:16,162 --> 00:24:19,732
Did you notice anything,
uh, unusual?

395
00:24:19,965 --> 00:24:22,435
Mm-mm, no. No, nothing.

396
00:24:22,835 --> 00:24:25,337
Nothing?
'Cause he's been taken hostage

397
00:24:25,838 --> 00:24:27,306
- <i>by Roy Lambert...</i>
- Fuck.

398
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,875
- ...<i>Grace Baker, and Toby.</i>
- What?

399
00:24:30,643 --> 00:24:33,345
- What's Toby's last name?
- Tony Cavendish.

400
00:24:33,779 --> 00:24:36,415
- Toby Cavendish.
- Same mom as Grace and Brigit.

401
00:24:36,449 --> 00:24:37,717
- Different dad.
- [Marisa] <i>Yeah, yeah.</i>

402
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:38,951
<i>I'm on my way, I'm on my way.</i>

403
00:24:39,285 --> 00:24:41,954
[Ben] I want you to go
to the far side of the lake,

404
00:24:42,254 --> 00:24:43,856
- <i>go to the point.</i>
- You got it.

405
00:24:43,889 --> 00:24:45,991
- [Ben] <i>Play God.</i>
- You got it, you got it. Shit.

406
00:24:48,461 --> 00:24:49,862
This whole police department
is fucked.

407
00:24:50,262 --> 00:24:52,832
First thing I'm gonna do when
I get in charge, I'm firing her.

408
00:24:53,499 --> 00:24:55,501
FBI's gonna make a meal
out of this.

409
00:24:56,202 --> 00:24:57,837
We should wait,
let them handle it.

410
00:24:58,237 --> 00:25:00,372
Yeah, the feds are gonna
fuck this up.

411
00:25:02,608 --> 00:25:04,643
Let's let them cool off.

412
00:25:05,478 --> 00:25:06,846
What, are you trying to
be a hero now?

413
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:11,016
Fuck off.
I can do this.

414
00:25:12,952 --> 00:25:14,820
[Toby] What you hidin'
in that safe room, Keats?

415
00:25:15,421 --> 00:25:19,291
That where you keep your
reptilian friends hidden? Hm?

416
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:23,963
I'm gonna find out all your
secrets by the end of this day.

417
00:25:24,764 --> 00:25:25,531
[Keats]
What gives you the impression

418
00:25:25,564 --> 00:25:27,933
that I'm anything
but a good man?

419
00:25:28,167 --> 00:25:30,669
[sighs] Well, this is Georgia.

420
00:25:30,903 --> 00:25:32,371
Everyone is doing something

421
00:25:32,404 --> 00:25:33,973
they're not
supposed to be doing.

422
00:25:34,173 --> 00:25:36,308
Sometimes it's their cousin

423
00:25:36,876 --> 00:25:39,845
and sometimes people
are running a satanic sex cult.

424
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:41,881
Now.

425
00:25:42,114 --> 00:25:44,383
I say we just remove
his fingernails

426
00:25:44,416 --> 00:25:45,584
with a fucking blender.

427
00:25:45,618 --> 00:25:46,886
How would that even work?

428
00:25:47,453 --> 00:25:50,923
I read a book about it.
You break the wrist first.

429
00:25:50,956 --> 00:25:52,958
You tap the fingers,
you do one finger at a time...

430
00:25:52,992 --> 00:25:54,894
We're not fucking
torturing anyone!

431
00:25:55,795 --> 00:25:56,896
- [Grace] Yet.
- No.

432
00:25:58,130 --> 00:26:00,032
You don't got the stomach
for this,

433
00:26:00,065 --> 00:26:02,034
why don't you just
walk off, Roy?

434
00:26:02,334 --> 00:26:05,371
- Right now.
- Brigit was everything to me.

435
00:26:05,604 --> 00:26:08,407
I think about her
every fucking day.

436
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:11,777
She made me a better person
and if we torture him,

437
00:26:11,811 --> 00:26:13,479
we're no fucking better
than him.

438
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:18,017
We were country
founded on violence, Roy.

439
00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:19,051
You hear me?

440
00:26:19,585 --> 00:26:20,920
Fuck are you talking about?

441
00:26:20,953 --> 00:26:23,055
I'm talking about
our constitutional right

442
00:26:23,088 --> 00:26:27,393
as American citizens
to enact violence on people

443
00:26:27,593 --> 00:26:30,796
so we can get what we want
in the name of justice.

444
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:32,832
You are fucking crazy!

445
00:26:33,632 --> 00:26:34,800
Yes, I am.

446
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:41,073
You are a rare specimen, Toby.
And you too, Grace.

447
00:26:41,407 --> 00:26:42,608
Thank you.

448
00:26:42,908 --> 00:26:45,578
I didn't mean that
as a good thing.

449
00:26:46,045 --> 00:26:48,581
You see,
Brigit was nothing like you.

450
00:26:49,014 --> 00:26:50,716
She was a team player.

451
00:26:50,749 --> 00:26:52,918
[Toby] Hey, she worked for you
one summer for two months.

452
00:26:53,253 --> 00:26:54,453
You didn't know her.

453
00:26:55,654 --> 00:26:57,089
Brigit Baker was not the young
woman you thought she was.

454
00:26:57,122 --> 00:26:58,490
What do you mean?

455
00:27:00,125 --> 00:27:01,794
She never loved you, Roy.

456
00:27:01,827 --> 00:27:02,928
Ain't that the truth. [chuckles]

457
00:27:02,962 --> 00:27:05,998
No, you do not have permission
to talk to me like that.

458
00:27:06,031 --> 00:27:08,701
[laughs] I will talk to you
however I want to.

459
00:27:08,734 --> 00:27:09,635
No, you won't.

460
00:27:09,668 --> 00:27:12,004
We were in love.
From the moment I met her,

461
00:27:12,037 --> 00:27:13,973
she was everything to me.

462
00:27:14,974 --> 00:27:16,442
Where'd you meet, Roy?

463
00:27:16,475 --> 00:27:18,077
It's none of
your fucking business.

464
00:27:18,777 --> 00:27:22,948
You met at a show in Bridgeport
and one cool summer night.

465
00:27:23,215 --> 00:27:25,651
[indistinct chattering]

466
00:27:28,954 --> 00:27:30,589
[gentle music]

467
00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:32,524
[Keats] 'Bout 11:05.

468
00:27:35,961 --> 00:27:37,463
<i>She swept you off your feet.</i>

469
00:27:42,568 --> 00:27:45,070
<i>You was her music man.</i>

470
00:27:45,104 --> 00:27:46,972
[no audio]

471
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:48,874
How do you know that?

472
00:27:48,908 --> 00:27:50,976
She tell you that
before you fucking killed her?

473
00:27:51,911 --> 00:27:56,115
Brigit only spoke to you,
tolerated you,

474
00:27:56,715 --> 00:27:58,751
because Charles Rutledge
ordered it.

475
00:27:59,518 --> 00:28:03,455
That's a lie.
That's a fucking lie!

476
00:28:04,056 --> 00:28:05,991
[tense music]

477
00:28:07,059 --> 00:28:08,560
[Keats] And you two?

478
00:28:09,296 --> 00:28:11,196
She was embarrassed
by the both of you.

479
00:28:12,197 --> 00:28:13,666
Truth is,

480
00:28:13,999 --> 00:28:16,635
she resented the fact that
she was even related to you.

481
00:28:16,669 --> 00:28:18,871
Truth is,
she could be a prissy bitch.

482
00:28:18,904 --> 00:28:20,739
Hey, you don't
talk about her like that.

483
00:28:20,773 --> 00:28:24,176
- ...my sister too, I'mma talk...
- Do not disrespect her name

484
00:28:24,209 --> 00:28:26,812
- right now!
- [both shouting]

485
00:28:26,845 --> 00:28:30,115
[Roy] Stop! He's just trying
to get in our fucking heads!

486
00:28:30,149 --> 00:28:31,150
Stop!

487
00:28:32,151 --> 00:28:33,052
Stop!

488
00:28:35,521 --> 00:28:38,023
Well, it's fucking working.
Ain't it?

489
00:28:43,229 --> 00:28:45,731
[music continues]

490
00:29:00,246 --> 00:29:01,814
[indistinct chattering]

491
00:29:20,899 --> 00:29:22,835
[flames crackling]

492
00:29:45,758 --> 00:29:46,959
Mr. Rutledge.

493
00:29:50,162 --> 00:29:51,264
Grace Baker?

494
00:29:53,732 --> 00:29:54,733
Okay.

495
00:29:55,768 --> 00:29:56,769
Move out.

496
00:30:04,977 --> 00:30:08,580
[engines rumbling]

497
00:30:21,827 --> 00:30:23,662
[mutters indistinctly]

498
00:30:25,331 --> 00:30:28,000
I'm going to find out
all your secrets, I am.

499
00:30:31,036 --> 00:30:32,137
[whispers] Okay.

500
00:30:32,505 --> 00:30:34,173
How does this work?

501
00:30:38,344 --> 00:30:42,014
Oh, and you thought you built
you so smart, you damn door.

502
00:30:42,382 --> 00:30:44,183
Let me tell you,

503
00:30:45,150 --> 00:30:49,255
Toby's going to find a way in.
Fucking find a way.

504
00:30:51,990 --> 00:30:55,160
Oh, guess we're gonna do this
the old fashioned way, door.

505
00:31:11,777 --> 00:31:13,178
[whispers] Here we go.

506
00:31:18,418 --> 00:31:19,218
Fire in the hole.

507
00:31:20,786 --> 00:31:23,222
[explosion rumbles]

508
00:31:24,324 --> 00:31:26,024
What the fuck was that?

509
00:31:27,025 --> 00:31:28,894
Hoo-hoo-hoo!

510
00:31:28,927 --> 00:31:31,930
- What the fuck was that?
- Sounded like C4.

511
00:31:31,964 --> 00:31:34,400
[coughing]

512
00:31:36,369 --> 00:31:37,870
Shit.

513
00:31:39,204 --> 00:31:42,074
You are one goddamn
strong door, aren't you?

514
00:31:43,008 --> 00:31:44,244
Where'd he get C4 from?

515
00:31:44,444 --> 00:31:46,845
I don't know.
Probably had it in his pocket.

516
00:31:47,347 --> 00:31:48,714
Redneck.

517
00:31:51,417 --> 00:31:54,354
That was some of the weakest C4
I ever blown up.

518
00:31:56,088 --> 00:31:57,222
[whispers] That's all right.

519
00:31:59,292 --> 00:32:01,093
I'm gonna find my way in.

520
00:32:03,263 --> 00:32:04,264
Here we go.

521
00:32:06,798 --> 00:32:08,434
- [electricity buzzes]
- Ah, shit!

522
00:32:10,236 --> 00:32:11,770
We should get in there,
save the day.

523
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:16,108
Well, that would be stupid.

524
00:32:20,346 --> 00:32:22,382
Ha-ha! Hell yes.

525
00:32:22,415 --> 00:32:25,251
That's a '61 St. Andrews,
don't you dare.

526
00:32:27,453 --> 00:32:29,955
[sighs] It's a little early
to be celebrating, Grace.

527
00:32:33,091 --> 00:32:34,427
Bit late to be sober.

528
00:32:35,295 --> 00:32:38,030
Nah, you're on probation,
that would be illegal.

529
00:32:38,063 --> 00:32:39,731
[Roy]
Are you ever not a fuck up?

530
00:32:40,466 --> 00:32:43,336
Give me one more ounce of lip
and I will lay you out.

531
00:32:45,037 --> 00:32:46,406
You are a very angry person.

532
00:32:46,439 --> 00:32:48,374
Oh-ho,
I can be a violent person too.

533
00:32:48,408 --> 00:32:50,376
I contain multitudes,
motherfucker.

534
00:32:52,778 --> 00:32:54,314
You people are sick in the head.

535
00:32:56,114 --> 00:32:57,483
We haven't even
gotten started yet.

536
00:32:58,451 --> 00:33:00,453
You killed Kane in cold blood.

537
00:33:00,486 --> 00:33:03,456
Our blood hasn't been cold
in 10 years.

538
00:33:03,489 --> 00:33:05,791
Who's Kane?
Your security guard? [scoffs]

539
00:33:05,824 --> 00:33:09,262
Yeah, I tore through him
like a seafood buffet.

540
00:33:09,295 --> 00:33:10,463
He's not my guard.

541
00:33:11,497 --> 00:33:12,498
The fuck you say?

542
00:33:13,266 --> 00:33:15,033
[Keats] You're so naïve, child.

543
00:33:15,867 --> 00:33:19,071
I'd leave this place if I could.
Forget it.

544
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:20,440
Say that again.

545
00:33:22,107 --> 00:33:24,310
Charles. He's the monster.

546
00:33:24,843 --> 00:33:27,212
He's the one you need to be
asking questions about Brigit,

547
00:33:27,513 --> 00:33:28,448
not me.

548
00:33:28,481 --> 00:33:29,881
They don't let you leave?

549
00:33:32,851 --> 00:33:35,754
Once a week I get to go get
a good meal at a restaurant.

550
00:33:36,121 --> 00:33:37,889
Other than that,
I'll work for Charles.

551
00:33:39,191 --> 00:33:41,126
Over and over.

552
00:33:41,893 --> 00:33:44,963
- You're serious.
- As cancer.

553
00:33:47,367 --> 00:33:48,434
[sighs]

554
00:33:56,174 --> 00:33:57,909
[phone vibrating]

555
00:34:00,045 --> 00:34:01,314
[Roy over phone]
<i>What does Charles Rutledge</i>

556
00:34:01,347 --> 00:34:02,348
<i>have to do with this?</i>

557
00:34:03,915 --> 00:34:05,251
<i>All we want is the truth.</i>

558
00:34:05,285 --> 00:34:07,387
It's not as easy as it sounds.

559
00:34:08,288 --> 00:34:11,089
Nothing worth getting is easy,
except drunk.

560
00:34:11,557 --> 00:34:14,327
Easy? Not the way I do it.

561
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:16,496
[Grace scoffs]
Oh, we're making jokes now?

562
00:34:16,529 --> 00:34:17,996
Well, here's a funny one
for you.

563
00:34:18,030 --> 00:34:19,599
Brigit was 19
when she disappeared

564
00:34:19,632 --> 00:34:22,335
and she never had
a legal drink in her life.

565
00:34:38,216 --> 00:34:41,019
If, you know you were them,

566
00:34:42,054 --> 00:34:43,456
how would you escape?

567
00:34:43,489 --> 00:34:45,957
[Kyle]
Well, we got lake on both sides,

568
00:34:46,726 --> 00:34:49,595
but in the back, it's just bush
all the way to Florida.

569
00:34:52,130 --> 00:34:53,932
[Ben]
They knew they weren't leaving.

570
00:34:54,367 --> 00:34:55,934
[phone dialing]

571
00:35:02,642 --> 00:35:04,243
[Ben over phone]
<i>Mr. Rutledge.</i>

572
00:35:04,943 --> 00:35:07,079
I got this
right where I want it.

573
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,915
- [Charles] <i>Not fast enough.</i>
- I'm taking care of it.

574
00:35:10,616 --> 00:35:14,454
Silas and the old boys are en
route to expedite the situation.

575
00:35:14,654 --> 00:35:17,256
We can't just
shoot our way out of it.

576
00:35:21,927 --> 00:35:23,296
Doctor Keats...

577
00:35:23,895 --> 00:35:25,931
means a great deal to this town.

578
00:35:26,499 --> 00:35:29,134
We lose him, we possibly
lose our way of life.

579
00:35:30,403 --> 00:35:31,537
<i>Am I understood?</i>

580
00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:37,343
There's a chance that this ends
without another bullet fired.

581
00:35:38,644 --> 00:35:41,447
- [Charles] <i>How?</i>
- Anything you can tell me?

582
00:35:42,582 --> 00:35:45,016
About Brigit's disappearance?

583
00:35:45,651 --> 00:35:48,554
- I wouldn't go there.
- [Ben] <i>Or what?</i>

584
00:35:50,590 --> 00:35:52,425
You might join her.

585
00:35:53,459 --> 00:35:54,960
Wherever that may be.

586
00:35:55,294 --> 00:35:58,498
- A girl went missing.
- [Charles] <i>You investigated.</i>

587
00:36:00,299 --> 00:36:04,102
And the town had a vigil,
and no body was ever found.

588
00:36:05,471 --> 00:36:07,440
You even said it yourself.

589
00:36:07,939 --> 00:36:11,977
- <i>No body, no crime.</i>
- Think of their perspective.

590
00:36:13,413 --> 00:36:14,980
<i>Imagine if it was Kyle.</i>

591
00:36:15,281 --> 00:36:16,649
<i>How far would you go for him?</i>

592
00:36:17,082 --> 00:36:18,984
Stay in your lane, Sheriff.

593
00:36:19,485 --> 00:36:20,586
<i>Assist Silas.</i>

594
00:36:21,186 --> 00:36:26,492
The FBI negotiating team is
going to be here in 41 minutes.

595
00:36:27,125 --> 00:36:29,995
<i>I need this wrapped
in a bow in 30.</i>

596
00:36:39,439 --> 00:36:41,340
Your daddy sends his love.

597
00:36:42,007 --> 00:36:44,677
I thought Roy Lambert
was doing 10 years for assault.

598
00:36:45,043 --> 00:36:48,079
- [laughing] He was.
- Who did he attack?

599
00:36:50,015 --> 00:36:51,317
Three guesses.

600
00:36:52,452 --> 00:36:54,520
Doctor Keats? No.

601
00:36:55,388 --> 00:36:56,422
Dad?

602
00:36:57,222 --> 00:36:59,090
Roy sucker-punched him.

603
00:37:01,427 --> 00:37:03,596
Yeah,
and your dad got him a decade.

604
00:37:03,796 --> 00:37:05,698
10 years for assaulting someone?

605
00:37:05,964 --> 00:37:07,600
Must have been hell of a punch.

606
00:37:08,166 --> 00:37:09,134
It was.

607
00:37:11,203 --> 00:37:13,739
After we called off
the search for Brigit,

608
00:37:14,407 --> 00:37:17,510
your father,
in his infinite wisdom,

609
00:37:17,543 --> 00:37:21,179
told Roy that Brigit
was better off dead.

610
00:37:22,682 --> 00:37:24,383
I woulda punched him too.

611
00:37:26,719 --> 00:37:27,753
You wouldn't've.

612
00:37:28,254 --> 00:37:31,089
[car brakes squealing]

613
00:37:45,771 --> 00:37:47,540
[fly buzzing]

614
00:37:52,545 --> 00:37:55,648
- [phone ringing]
- Shit.

615
00:37:56,482 --> 00:37:57,416
Are you in position?

616
00:37:57,817 --> 00:37:59,552
[Marisa over phone] <i>Patience
isn't one of your virtues,</i>

617
00:37:59,585 --> 00:38:00,586
<i>is it, Ben?</i>

618
00:38:05,223 --> 00:38:06,726
I spoke with Mrs. Baker.

619
00:38:07,293 --> 00:38:09,262
She doesn't want anything
to do with her daughter.

620
00:38:09,729 --> 00:38:11,597
<i>Adopted daughter, that is.</i>

621
00:38:12,298 --> 00:38:14,600
I've got eyes and ammo
on the house.

622
00:38:14,901 --> 00:38:16,636
Unless they don't
get through you...

623
00:38:18,404 --> 00:38:19,672
they ain't comin' through here.

624
00:38:20,138 --> 00:38:24,777
That's my call, don't fire till
I give the green light.

625
00:38:24,810 --> 00:38:27,112
Understood. Sheriff.

626
00:38:27,145 --> 00:38:28,748
[tense music]

627
00:38:28,781 --> 00:38:31,784
[engines rumbling]

628
00:38:33,786 --> 00:38:35,621
Oh, fuck.

629
00:39:06,552 --> 00:39:07,553
Ben.

630
00:39:10,690 --> 00:39:11,791
We've got it under control.

631
00:39:12,458 --> 00:39:13,659
Doesn't look that way to me.

632
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:15,328
Look Ben,
it's been a true pleasure

633
00:39:15,361 --> 00:39:16,662
working with you on this,

634
00:39:16,696 --> 00:39:17,830
but we got it from here.

635
00:39:19,065 --> 00:39:20,700
Why don't you and the kid go
set up a perimeter or some shit?

636
00:39:21,033 --> 00:39:22,768
Fuck off, Silas.

637
00:39:24,870 --> 00:39:25,671
Timeline.

638
00:39:26,137 --> 00:39:28,674
[man] 15 minutes to breach,
10 to wrap out.

639
00:39:29,308 --> 00:39:31,777
[Silas] Rutledge wants this done
and we're here to handle it.

640
00:39:32,445 --> 00:39:35,781
Thank you for your service,
but you're on the bench.

641
00:39:35,815 --> 00:39:36,816
Let's go.

642
00:39:41,754 --> 00:39:43,823
[Kyle] Ben,
what the hell's happening here?

643
00:39:44,323 --> 00:39:45,758
Dad sent a militia?

644
00:39:46,492 --> 00:39:48,594
You think you can
get inside the house?

645
00:39:50,296 --> 00:39:51,330
How?

646
00:39:51,764 --> 00:39:53,265
Hug the tree line.

647
00:39:53,666 --> 00:39:56,167
Wait. So you want me
inside the house

648
00:39:56,201 --> 00:39:57,837
so Silas
doesn't shoot the shit up?

649
00:40:00,205 --> 00:40:01,340
Something like that.

650
00:40:01,941 --> 00:40:03,876
A bloodbath won't do anything.

651
00:40:05,845 --> 00:40:07,212
You understand?

652
00:40:08,748 --> 00:40:09,715
[Kyle] All right.

653
00:40:10,148 --> 00:40:11,484
You ain't gonna do it,

654
00:40:11,884 --> 00:40:13,886
guess it's my time
to be the hero.

655
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:16,322
It's my time.

656
00:40:33,806 --> 00:40:34,807
[Toby] Say what?

657
00:40:35,941 --> 00:40:36,909
You want me to do what?

658
00:40:37,710 --> 00:40:38,878
Get up on in here?

659
00:40:39,745 --> 00:40:41,947
Okay. I can do that.

660
00:40:42,915 --> 00:40:44,350
Jesus be with me.

661
00:40:45,951 --> 00:40:47,920
We're doing
the Lord's work here.

662
00:40:48,821 --> 00:40:49,889
Okay.

663
00:40:49,922 --> 00:40:52,324
[Roy] Brigit told me
Toby was going off the deep end,

664
00:40:52,358 --> 00:40:54,427
but that guy needs help.

665
00:40:54,927 --> 00:40:56,762
He went downhill after Brigit.

666
00:40:57,096 --> 00:40:59,498
Last year he went to
a donnybrook in Alabama,

667
00:40:59,765 --> 00:41:01,934
said he partied
and got a weird bump of coke.

668
00:41:04,837 --> 00:41:07,940
Grace.
Didn't you want to be a dancer?

669
00:41:09,909 --> 00:41:12,778
Whatever happened to that
Grace Baker used to...

670
00:41:13,279 --> 00:41:14,980
sell Girl Scout cookies
door to door?

671
00:41:15,281 --> 00:41:17,416
She learned to fight
and shoot a gun.

672
00:41:19,752 --> 00:41:22,488
Must have been real hard
growing up in Brigit's shadow.

673
00:41:24,356 --> 00:41:25,825
She was wicked smart.

674
00:41:26,792 --> 00:41:28,894
I helped her write
some of her college application.

675
00:41:31,430 --> 00:41:34,834
I even helped her win that
full ride scholarship to Yale.

676
00:41:35,768 --> 00:41:37,903
Broke my heart
when Charles convinced her to...

677
00:41:38,304 --> 00:41:40,272
join the town business.

678
00:41:41,974 --> 00:41:43,609
Brigit was a good kid.

679
00:41:44,443 --> 00:41:46,011
One of the greatest kids
you could hope for

680
00:41:46,045 --> 00:41:47,680
coming out of a foster home.

681
00:41:50,082 --> 00:41:51,817
She always looked out for you.

682
00:41:52,985 --> 00:41:54,353
Didn't she?

683
00:41:56,956 --> 00:41:58,324
You and Toby?

684
00:42:00,659 --> 00:42:02,361
Your caseworks failed you.

685
00:42:03,729 --> 00:42:06,732
But the three of you?
You always had each other.

686
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:08,901
That's good.

687
00:42:10,402 --> 00:42:11,670
Nice.

688
00:42:14,907 --> 00:42:17,710
I had a foster kid once.
Didn't work out.

689
00:42:17,977 --> 00:42:20,646
Of course, that was
back when the state paid you

690
00:42:20,679 --> 00:42:22,715
good money
to take care of bastards.

691
00:42:22,748 --> 00:42:23,783
[Roy] Do you hear yourself?

692
00:42:24,150 --> 00:42:25,851
Does that sound like
a normal thing to say?

693
00:42:26,886 --> 00:42:31,724
Some of those kids, their
family tree looked like circles.

694
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:37,296
Grace. I want you to know.

695
00:42:38,931 --> 00:42:42,802
Just because your own family
abandoned you doesn't mean

696
00:42:42,835 --> 00:42:44,370
you have to give up on yourself.

697
00:42:45,971 --> 00:42:47,940
All this hate,

698
00:42:49,041 --> 00:42:50,876
all this anger...

699
00:42:53,379 --> 00:42:55,548
Brigit would have wanted you
to forget her.

700
00:42:57,616 --> 00:42:58,951
Well, I try.

701
00:42:59,252 --> 00:43:02,054
- What? You try?
- Shut up.

702
00:43:02,822 --> 00:43:03,889
You try?

703
00:43:03,923 --> 00:43:05,024
[Grace] That's not what I meant.

704
00:43:05,057 --> 00:43:07,393
What'd you mean then?
Enlighten us.

705
00:43:09,028 --> 00:43:14,400
I've spent 10 years trying
to move on, Roy. 10 years.

706
00:43:14,867 --> 00:43:20,105
And I feel guilty,
but I want to forget her. I do.

707
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:24,777
I try so hard, but my mind
just doesn't let me sleep.

708
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:27,980
And I keep thinking about what
these sick fucks did to her!

709
00:43:28,547 --> 00:43:30,416
And I just wanna sleep.

710
00:43:31,784 --> 00:43:33,452
I need to know
what happened, Roy.

711
00:43:35,821 --> 00:43:38,424
I'm tired of visiting
an empty grave.

712
00:43:41,627 --> 00:43:43,729
[Roy]
I spent 10 years in prison.

713
00:43:44,029 --> 00:43:46,966
I lost my career.
I lost everything.

714
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:50,769
No one cared. Except for you.

715
00:43:51,971 --> 00:43:53,973
You and the memory of her.

716
00:43:54,473 --> 00:43:56,542
That's all that kept me sane.

717
00:43:56,575 --> 00:43:57,476
Okay, well try being free

718
00:43:57,509 --> 00:43:59,712
and not being able
to do anything about it

719
00:43:59,745 --> 00:44:02,014
because I made your stupid ass
a promise

720
00:44:02,047 --> 00:44:04,416
that I would wait until
you got out to do shit.

721
00:44:04,817 --> 00:44:06,552
And every soul
from God to the devil

722
00:44:06,585 --> 00:44:09,455
knows that Grace Baker
keeps her word.

723
00:44:10,389 --> 00:44:13,425
I swore on Brigit's grave
that I would kill anyone

724
00:44:13,459 --> 00:44:16,128
who had anything to do
with her disappearance.

725
00:44:16,161 --> 00:44:19,732
If I find out that you had
anything to do with it,

726
00:44:19,765 --> 00:44:21,133
God fucking help you,

727
00:44:21,334 --> 00:44:23,535
I kill you myself.

728
00:44:25,004 --> 00:44:26,071
[sobs]

729
00:44:26,105 --> 00:44:28,607
[somber music]

730
00:44:45,124 --> 00:44:46,792
- [clattering]
- Shit.

731
00:44:47,294 --> 00:44:48,494
[Roy] You hear that?

732
00:44:52,831 --> 00:44:54,033
Toby, do you hear that?

733
00:45:09,181 --> 00:45:12,184
- [man] Who's inside?
- [Ben] You got Roy,

734
00:45:12,551 --> 00:45:15,587
you got Grace,
and the dipshit cousin,

735
00:45:16,221 --> 00:45:17,589
I can't remember his name.

736
00:45:18,190 --> 00:45:20,225
[man] Yeah, Toby Cavendish.
What a piece of shit.

737
00:45:20,693 --> 00:45:24,096
Toby Cavendish is nothing but
an all-American loser.

738
00:45:24,830 --> 00:45:27,866
[man] I heard he tried
to start a gun store and failed.

739
00:45:28,534 --> 00:45:31,136
Who the fuck can't make money
owning a gun store in Georgia?

740
00:45:31,737 --> 00:45:34,006
[man 2] Are we just
doing surveillance for now?

741
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:37,042
'Cause this drone could knock
real loud if it needs to.

742
00:45:37,543 --> 00:45:40,179
You're not doing
a fucking drone strike.

743
00:45:40,546 --> 00:45:42,248
You're gonna kill Keats.

744
00:45:43,716 --> 00:45:46,852
Rutledge authorized it,
so we're doing it.

745
00:45:50,055 --> 00:45:52,057
Yo,
didn't Toby and Grace enlist?

746
00:45:52,725 --> 00:45:55,561
[chuckles]
Yeah, I heard that too.

747
00:45:56,262 --> 00:45:57,963
Then they washed out.

748
00:45:58,365 --> 00:46:01,234
[drone whirring]

749
00:46:01,267 --> 00:46:03,902
[dramatic music]

750
00:46:13,279 --> 00:46:14,747
- You find anyone?
- No.

751
00:46:21,020 --> 00:46:22,121
What is that?

752
00:46:22,154 --> 00:46:23,356
Called a drone, convict.

753
00:46:23,390 --> 00:46:27,226
Or in the language of my people,
we call it target practice.

754
00:46:28,961 --> 00:46:30,929
[gunshots firing]

755
00:46:32,664 --> 00:46:33,665
[chuckles]

756
00:46:35,301 --> 00:46:37,270
- [explosion booms]
- [men shouting]

757
00:46:37,303 --> 00:46:38,271
Come on!

758
00:46:39,239 --> 00:46:41,673
[Ben laughing]

759
00:46:46,312 --> 00:46:52,117
Oh, what a strange toy that
is for grown men. [laughing]

760
00:46:54,219 --> 00:46:55,754
All right,
we're gonna take this house.

761
00:46:55,788 --> 00:46:57,689
We don't need robots.
You got it?

762
00:46:59,292 --> 00:47:01,693
[Roy] Charles didn't
exactly send his finest minds.

763
00:47:02,027 --> 00:47:03,229
The hell was that?

764
00:47:04,264 --> 00:47:06,031
What? Why are you smiling?

765
00:47:06,332 --> 00:47:08,301
That wasn't a drone,
that was a drone-drone.

766
00:47:08,334 --> 00:47:10,869
They must've packed that TNT
or some shit,

767
00:47:10,903 --> 00:47:13,072
'cause I only shot it
with my .556.

768
00:47:14,773 --> 00:47:17,343
That means they think
you're expendable, John Keats.

769
00:47:17,377 --> 00:47:20,646
[whistles]
Well, that's fascinating.

770
00:47:21,980 --> 00:47:23,982
How about that, Doctor Keats?

771
00:47:24,616 --> 00:47:28,187
Who's more scary now?
Us or them?

772
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:29,322
Last time I saw Brigit,

773
00:47:30,523 --> 00:47:31,291
she was getting into the back
of the sheriff's cruiser.

774
00:47:31,324 --> 00:47:34,327
They were taking her away,
I swear.

775
00:47:35,261 --> 00:47:37,230
[tense music]

776
00:47:40,899 --> 00:47:42,201
Put it on speaker.

777
00:47:46,239 --> 00:47:47,773
[phone vibrating]

778
00:47:49,409 --> 00:47:50,477
Yeah?

779
00:47:50,510 --> 00:47:51,210
[Grace over phone]
<i>Why does Doctor Keats say that</i>

780
00:47:51,244 --> 00:47:52,545
you know
what happened to Brigit?

781
00:47:52,579 --> 00:47:56,682
[Ben over phone] <i>Me? I hardly
know my way to the station.</i>

782
00:47:57,350 --> 00:47:59,718
What possible reason
would I have?

783
00:48:00,453 --> 00:48:04,390
Doctor Keats said he saw her
in your police cruiser.

784
00:48:04,424 --> 00:48:07,626
[Ben] <i>10 years ago?
I blacked out drunk.</i>

785
00:48:08,361 --> 00:48:09,229
If you ain't
trying to hide anything,

786
00:48:09,262 --> 00:48:10,996
why are you sending
drone-drones, huh?

787
00:48:11,029 --> 00:48:12,332
Trying to turn this into Waco?

788
00:48:12,698 --> 00:48:15,200
[Ben] <i>No more bloodshed,
okay? Please.</i>

789
00:48:15,634 --> 00:48:17,903
<i>I don't know
what happened to Brigit.</i>

790
00:48:20,005 --> 00:48:21,374
<i>Grace, you hear me?</i>

791
00:48:24,444 --> 00:48:25,644
Ah.

792
00:48:26,778 --> 00:48:31,351
I don't... I... I investigated it
and it's... it's tough.

793
00:48:32,485 --> 00:48:35,355
<i>I put together
a list of suspects.</i>

794
00:48:35,787 --> 00:48:38,957
<i>On the top of the list,
Roy Lambert.</i>

795
00:48:39,725 --> 00:48:40,759
Bullshit!

796
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:45,331
When he assaulted Charles,
it gave us a way to lock him up.

797
00:48:45,365 --> 00:48:47,833
- It's bullshit.
- [Ben] <i>Charles insisted</i>

798
00:48:47,866 --> 00:48:50,936
<i>we stop the investigation
after Roy's conviction</i>

799
00:48:51,337 --> 00:48:53,071
<i>to keep the community safe.</i>

800
00:48:53,105 --> 00:48:56,476
<i>And around here, whatever
Charles wants, he gets.</i>

801
00:48:56,509 --> 00:48:58,777
- Anything else?
- [Ben] Just....

802
00:48:59,512 --> 00:49:02,348
<i>let Doctor Keats go.</i>

803
00:49:02,382 --> 00:49:05,318
<i>Nobody else
needs to die today.</i>

804
00:49:07,019 --> 00:49:08,321
Christ.

805
00:49:11,491 --> 00:49:13,058
[Roy] They fucking set me up.

806
00:49:13,692 --> 00:49:16,396
She was the best girl
that I ever met.

807
00:49:16,962 --> 00:49:18,764
She was too good for me.

808
00:49:19,432 --> 00:49:21,767
But you know there's no way
I could have done this.

809
00:49:23,269 --> 00:49:24,470
[Grace]
She was too good for you.

810
00:49:24,504 --> 00:49:25,471
[Roy] She was.

811
00:49:26,439 --> 00:49:28,073
She really wants.

812
00:49:29,107 --> 00:49:30,142
[whispers] Christ.

813
00:49:30,343 --> 00:49:31,477
I know you didn't kill Brig.

814
00:49:32,144 --> 00:49:34,247
- Thanks.
- You're too much of a pussy.

815
00:49:34,947 --> 00:49:38,050
Now, I definitely know
they're hiding something,

816
00:49:38,083 --> 00:49:39,818
so, Toby, get that door down.

817
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:41,321
What the hell you think

818
00:49:41,354 --> 00:49:43,121
I've been trying to do,
little sister?

819
00:49:43,155 --> 00:49:44,890
Trying ain't doing, is it,
big brother?

820
00:49:46,459 --> 00:49:48,026
[Keats]
Some things can't be unseen.

821
00:49:49,462 --> 00:49:50,796
If you get through that door,

822
00:49:52,130 --> 00:49:53,399
everything changes.

823
00:49:58,103 --> 00:49:59,472
I told y'all!

824
00:50:00,939 --> 00:50:05,143
I'mma get in that door
right now. You hear me?

825
00:50:09,382 --> 00:50:12,851
[dramatic music]

826
00:50:32,538 --> 00:50:36,208
Holy shit. Charles Rutledge
actually showed up.

827
00:50:36,576 --> 00:50:39,044
I'll say my plan is working.

828
00:50:40,012 --> 00:50:41,213
Your plan?

829
00:50:47,253 --> 00:50:48,521
Status.

830
00:50:49,355 --> 00:50:52,924
Boys are preppin' now.
We've only got to do this once.

831
00:50:53,626 --> 00:50:55,528
How did
your delicate approach go?

832
00:50:56,061 --> 00:50:59,265
[Ben]
It's goin'. Kyle's inside now.

833
00:50:59,465 --> 00:51:00,366
What?

834
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:02,067
[Silas]
What the fuck did you just say?

835
00:51:02,702 --> 00:51:04,370
There was no stopping him.

836
00:51:05,070 --> 00:51:08,106
- He overpowered me.
- Don't get it, do you?

837
00:51:09,207 --> 00:51:10,543
Negotiating with them,

838
00:51:11,209 --> 00:51:13,413
announces to every
goddamn degenerate

839
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:16,549
that all they have to do
to get ahead in this world

840
00:51:16,749 --> 00:51:18,618
is point a gun in a man's face

841
00:51:18,651 --> 00:51:20,353
that works for a living.

842
00:51:21,387 --> 00:51:23,489
No. Those are assholes.

843
00:51:24,590 --> 00:51:25,924
They have a different mindset.

844
00:51:26,492 --> 00:51:29,462
Now you sent my only son
in there to deal with them.

845
00:51:31,897 --> 00:51:33,466
[phone dialing]

846
00:51:36,001 --> 00:51:38,471
Marisa? Got eyes on Kyle?

847
00:51:40,138 --> 00:51:44,876
Negative. I can't see him.
He's not with you?

848
00:51:46,579 --> 00:51:49,515
S'posed to be the babysitter,
fucking dumbass.

849
00:51:50,616 --> 00:51:52,285
I'm the sheriff of this county.

850
00:51:52,552 --> 00:51:54,019
[Charles] Yes, you are.

851
00:51:55,488 --> 00:51:59,091
Don't forget who put you there,
who keeps you there.

852
00:51:59,592 --> 00:52:01,327
And who could put you
in the ground

853
00:52:01,361 --> 00:52:03,463
faster than a sparrow can shit.

854
00:52:04,062 --> 00:52:09,369
You're a burned out, washed up
disgrace to this town,

855
00:52:09,702 --> 00:52:14,574
and it's only by my patience and
the benevolence of the good Lord

856
00:52:15,207 --> 00:52:16,609
that you're still breathing.

857
00:52:17,109 --> 00:52:20,513
My family, they built this town.

858
00:52:21,179 --> 00:52:25,183
They toiled to make her great.
My blood is in every tree.

859
00:52:25,685 --> 00:52:28,454
My breath in every gust of wind.

860
00:52:29,255 --> 00:52:32,658
Couldn't make it
as a cop in New York or Atlanta

861
00:52:32,692 --> 00:52:35,361
or even as a security guard
in a fucking Walmart.

862
00:52:35,994 --> 00:52:39,632
You're a corrupt,
godless, divorced,

863
00:52:39,665 --> 00:52:42,934
deadbeat dad whose only children

864
00:52:43,269 --> 00:52:45,304
don't even call you
on your birthday.

865
00:52:45,772 --> 00:52:49,975
Yeah, you're the sheriff.
What are you doing?

866
00:52:50,543 --> 00:52:52,278
Still thinking
you're the quarterback?

867
00:52:52,311 --> 00:52:53,312
Well, you're not.

868
00:52:53,679 --> 00:52:55,648
You're a fucking waste of space.

869
00:52:55,681 --> 00:53:00,486
You got me?
A fucking waste! Goddammit!

870
00:53:01,521 --> 00:53:03,188
- Are we clear?
- Yes.

871
00:53:03,523 --> 00:53:06,191
- [Charles] Yes, what?
- Yes, sir.

872
00:53:06,224 --> 00:53:07,326
Good.

873
00:53:07,627 --> 00:53:09,194
Now you're relieved, Sheriff.

874
00:53:09,961 --> 00:53:13,232
- Thank you for your service.
- Stop fucking yelling at me.

875
00:53:14,132 --> 00:53:16,201
Gonna send you the money
you need for that boat

876
00:53:16,235 --> 00:53:17,570
you wanted so bad,

877
00:53:17,603 --> 00:53:19,405
then I never wanna
see you again.

878
00:53:19,672 --> 00:53:20,673
That's the deal.

879
00:53:21,474 --> 00:53:24,142
Good doing business with you,
now fuck off!

880
00:53:24,176 --> 00:53:25,578
[Silas]
Get the fuck outta here, Ben.

881
00:53:26,279 --> 00:53:27,547
Goddamn it, boy!

882
00:53:28,013 --> 00:53:32,685
Ben! That's my property over
there! You're fucking walking!

883
00:53:34,019 --> 00:53:36,689
[dramatic music]

884
00:53:44,797 --> 00:53:46,632
[Grace] Where the hell
is the sheriff going?

885
00:54:09,388 --> 00:54:10,723
They're making a play.

886
00:54:10,756 --> 00:54:12,425
Are they really
trying to kill me?

887
00:54:12,458 --> 00:54:14,594
Now we have to
keep you alive. Great.

888
00:54:15,126 --> 00:54:16,295
Me?

889
00:54:16,329 --> 00:54:17,396
[Grace]
They'll have to get in line.

890
00:54:18,631 --> 00:54:20,131
T, if you want to get in there,
you gotta do it yesterday.

891
00:54:20,833 --> 00:54:22,368
[electricity buzzing]

892
00:54:24,537 --> 00:54:26,104
[groans] shit.

893
00:54:28,708 --> 00:54:30,141
[electricity whirring]

894
00:54:31,711 --> 00:54:34,680
[whispers] I knew it. I'm in.

895
00:54:36,716 --> 00:54:38,684
That's what I'm talking about.

896
00:54:40,753 --> 00:54:43,789
Come on, Jesus.
Help me open this door.

897
00:54:45,858 --> 00:54:47,158
[grunts]

898
00:54:49,094 --> 00:54:51,564
Hey Grace, I'm in.

899
00:54:51,931 --> 00:54:53,432
[whispers indistinctly]

900
00:55:05,278 --> 00:55:07,112
I can't see shit.

901
00:55:08,481 --> 00:55:10,115
Better not be aliens.

902
00:55:11,751 --> 00:55:13,519
All right, I'm going down.

903
00:55:16,455 --> 00:55:19,725
Stay with me now, JC.
Be with me.

904
00:55:19,759 --> 00:55:22,628
[tense music]

905
00:55:30,336 --> 00:55:32,170
[machinery whirring]

906
00:55:44,550 --> 00:55:45,851
[grunts]

907
00:55:56,829 --> 00:55:58,731
[music continues]

908
00:56:06,739 --> 00:56:09,542
[indistinct voices]

909
00:56:24,757 --> 00:56:26,492
[whimpering]

910
00:56:30,930 --> 00:56:32,598
[whimpering]

911
00:56:43,709 --> 00:56:46,278
[indistinct muttering]

912
00:56:58,891 --> 00:57:01,727
[humming]

913
00:57:24,550 --> 00:57:26,752
[humming]

914
00:57:31,957 --> 00:57:34,427
[tense music]

915
00:57:37,663 --> 00:57:38,764
[tone beeps]

916
00:57:41,367 --> 00:57:42,635
[phone vibrates]

917
00:57:44,470 --> 00:57:47,807
[Charles] The feds are
23 minutes out, three SUVs.

918
00:57:59,285 --> 00:58:00,920
[Toby] You're not
going to believe this.

919
00:58:01,787 --> 00:58:05,257
Turns out that Doctor Keats here
is cooking up more d-rugs

920
00:58:05,291 --> 00:58:07,493
below our feet than
Hunter S, Thompson could do

921
00:58:07,526 --> 00:58:08,961
in 1,000 lifetimes.

922
00:58:09,395 --> 00:58:14,533
You, my friends, are looking at
the Georgia Peach Pablo Escobar.

923
00:58:14,567 --> 00:58:16,268
- It's not what it looks like.
- Really?

924
00:58:16,669 --> 00:58:18,437
'Cause I saw enough d-rugs

925
00:58:18,471 --> 00:58:22,808
to make 1,000 pounds
of fentanyl, crystal, ecstasy.

926
00:58:22,842 --> 00:58:23,943
You name it.

927
00:58:24,477 --> 00:58:26,645
I was right, Grace,
this whole time.

928
00:58:26,912 --> 00:58:30,015
Me! I knew this, I was right,

929
00:58:30,049 --> 00:58:32,885
and y'all will never
hear the end of this.

930
00:58:33,586 --> 00:58:36,255
[Roy] There's four incoming.
Grace, get upstairs.

931
00:58:36,489 --> 00:58:37,923
[Grace] Yeah, well,
if you don't keep him alive,

932
00:58:37,957 --> 00:58:39,992
we won't live long enough
to hear the start of it.

933
00:58:41,026 --> 00:58:42,862
[tense music]

934
00:58:42,895 --> 00:58:44,830
[Roy] They're moving
to the side of the house, Grace.

935
00:58:46,966 --> 00:58:48,667
[whispers] You're the devil.

936
00:58:52,037 --> 00:58:53,339
[phone rings]

937
00:58:54,740 --> 00:58:56,375
Are you making a move
on the house?

938
00:58:56,709 --> 00:58:59,011
<i>Little fucking heads up
would have been nice, Ben.</i>

939
00:58:59,445 --> 00:59:01,013
Ben is no longer sheriff.

940
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:04,884
You get a shot at those SOBs,
you take it, you got me?

941
00:59:04,917 --> 00:59:06,585
[Marisa over phone]
<i>Oh, Mr. Rutledge.</i>

942
00:59:06,952 --> 00:59:08,921
Okay. Yes, sir.

943
00:59:16,562 --> 00:59:20,032
Oh, I can't wait to see
the faces of those FBI boys

944
00:59:20,065 --> 00:59:22,034
when they discover your stash.

945
00:59:22,067 --> 00:59:23,903
[laughs]

946
00:59:27,106 --> 00:59:28,974
[music continues]

947
00:59:29,975 --> 00:59:30,910
[gun cocks]

948
00:59:37,149 --> 00:59:39,685
[gunshots firing]

949
00:59:59,939 --> 01:00:00,906
Are you kidding?

950
01:00:09,048 --> 01:00:12,051
I lit those fuckers up
like a Christmas tree.

951
01:00:12,084 --> 01:00:13,919
[thudding]

952
01:00:14,420 --> 01:00:16,055
- [gun cocks]
- [grunts]

953
01:00:17,122 --> 01:00:19,825
Come here! Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah!

954
01:00:20,260 --> 01:00:21,460
C'mere, c'mere, c'mere.

955
01:00:21,827 --> 01:00:24,697
- [Grace grunts]
- [laughs] Wait, wait, hold on.

956
01:00:24,997 --> 01:00:28,667
[speaks indistinctly]
No? Yeah? Right?

957
01:00:28,968 --> 01:00:31,003
Drop it. Drop it!

958
01:00:31,036 --> 01:00:32,771
[Grace grunts]
Shoot this fuck nugget!

959
01:00:34,006 --> 01:00:36,075
[man] Hey, Keats.
What's goin' on?

960
01:00:36,675 --> 01:00:40,179
Did they get a call off? Huh?
Did they? Who'd you tell?

961
01:00:40,212 --> 01:00:41,380
I didn't tell 'em anything!

962
01:00:42,481 --> 01:00:43,582
No, that's bullshit.
I don't believe a word of it.

963
01:00:43,949 --> 01:00:46,752
I found out about
your cave of sin, though.

964
01:00:47,152 --> 01:00:49,655
How many people are in on it,
huh? The whole town?

965
01:00:50,155 --> 01:00:52,791
Oh, I think I know you.

966
01:00:53,225 --> 01:00:55,794
Aren't you little Callan Martin?

967
01:00:56,395 --> 01:00:58,063
You know [indistinct]
you couldn't even spell

968
01:00:58,097 --> 01:01:00,099
your own name till freshman
year!

969
01:01:00,132 --> 01:01:04,970
That's real rich coming from
the guy who wore a tin foil suit

970
01:01:05,004 --> 01:01:06,505
to his own graduation.

971
01:01:06,538 --> 01:01:08,107
Bet your parents
were real proud,

972
01:01:08,140 --> 01:01:09,141
thinking that you're, what?

973
01:01:10,343 --> 01:01:12,111
The fucking NSA was scratching
the inside of your skull?

974
01:01:12,444 --> 01:01:13,579
You loony bin.

975
01:01:13,612 --> 01:01:16,015
That's pretty cocky from
the guy who's got a gun on him.

976
01:01:16,249 --> 01:01:18,217
No, no, the only person
who's gonna be fucking shooting

977
01:01:18,251 --> 01:01:19,618
anybody is gonna be me.

978
01:01:19,952 --> 01:01:22,054
I'm gonna blow
your fucking head off.

979
01:01:22,087 --> 01:01:23,689
And then I'm gonna take my time,

980
01:01:24,156 --> 01:01:26,625
interrogatin' all three of ya.

981
01:01:27,893 --> 01:01:28,894
[gun cocks]

982
01:01:29,995 --> 01:01:31,897
[Kyle] Don't you fucking move.
I heard everything.

983
01:01:33,198 --> 01:01:34,667
Were you lyin'
about all that stuff

984
01:01:34,700 --> 01:01:36,502
they were saying about
that bunker, Toby?

985
01:01:36,535 --> 01:01:38,103
I wish I was, Kyle.

986
01:01:39,939 --> 01:01:40,973
Get it off me.

987
01:01:41,006 --> 01:01:43,208
I'm the only cop here man,
it's time for you to go.

988
01:01:43,243 --> 01:01:45,245
[Callan] You get that fucking
gun out of my back, boy.

989
01:01:45,278 --> 01:01:48,013
You couldn't hit the broad side
of a barn. [chuckles]

990
01:01:48,213 --> 01:01:50,015
You wouldn't know your ass
from a hole in the ground!

991
01:01:50,049 --> 01:01:52,084
You are way
the fuck over your head,

992
01:01:52,117 --> 01:01:53,253
[Kyle] Callan, you know,
I'm warning you.

993
01:01:53,286 --> 01:01:54,354
[Callan] No,
I'm gonna fucking tell you...

994
01:01:54,387 --> 01:01:56,689
[Kyle] Shut up. I mean,
you do not have to die here.

995
01:01:56,722 --> 01:01:57,923
[Callan]
Don't be a fucking hero.

996
01:01:57,957 --> 01:01:58,991
[Kyle] Get outta here, man.

997
01:01:59,024 --> 01:02:01,126
[Callan] Your daddy's outside!

998
01:02:01,160 --> 01:02:03,929
And the only person leaving
here alive is going to be me

999
01:02:03,963 --> 01:02:05,965
and possibly you unless
you fucking turn around

1000
01:02:05,998 --> 01:02:07,032
right when you came out of...

1001
01:02:07,066 --> 01:02:08,167
[Kyle] Grace!

1002
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:09,768
[gunshot]

1003
01:02:18,577 --> 01:02:21,213
[breathing heavily]

1004
01:02:22,014 --> 01:02:24,250
[somber music]

1005
01:02:32,157 --> 01:02:33,559
[grunts]

1006
01:02:41,301 --> 01:02:43,202
Never seen a dead body before.

1007
01:02:53,145 --> 01:02:56,282
[phone ringing]

1008
01:02:57,016 --> 01:02:58,150
[Toby] Roy.

1009
01:02:59,018 --> 01:03:02,154
Get the phone.
Come on, Roy, on the double.

1010
01:03:07,793 --> 01:03:09,862
[Charles over phone]
<i>Callan, status report.</i>

1011
01:03:09,895 --> 01:03:11,964
[Kyle]
Morning, Daddy. I'm sorry.

1012
01:03:14,600 --> 01:03:16,168
You hurt my boy...

1013
01:03:16,735 --> 01:03:20,572
and I'll rain an unholy violence
down upon you Sodomites.

1014
01:03:20,839 --> 01:03:24,710
Oh, we found your manufactorium
of iniquity, Charles.

1015
01:03:25,278 --> 01:03:27,746
You are responsible
for what happens now.

1016
01:03:28,113 --> 01:03:31,083
<i>Tell us everything that
you know about Brigit,</i>

1017
01:03:31,116 --> 01:03:34,219
<i>or Kyle gets real familiar
with the inside of my gun.</i>

1018
01:03:34,887 --> 01:03:38,190
You want to save your secrets
or your son?

1019
01:03:47,933 --> 01:03:49,668
[Charles] I have to give credit
where it's due.

1020
01:03:51,271 --> 01:03:53,672
Those three
shot your boys to shit.

1021
01:03:56,008 --> 01:03:57,142
Just a warm-up.

1022
01:04:00,212 --> 01:04:01,814
We don't have time for games.

1023
01:04:02,515 --> 01:04:06,985
Get in there. Get my son.
Kill the rest.

1024
01:04:07,853 --> 01:04:08,921
You got it?

1025
01:04:10,722 --> 01:04:12,325
[phone dialing]

1026
01:04:14,327 --> 01:04:18,063
Hey. How long
to get everybody to Keats's?

1027
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:21,600
Okay.

1028
01:04:22,134 --> 01:04:23,735
[saw whirring]

1029
01:04:23,769 --> 01:04:26,004
[phone ringing]

1030
01:04:26,439 --> 01:04:27,706
[phone chimes]

1031
01:04:27,739 --> 01:04:29,608
[tense music]

1032
01:04:43,423 --> 01:04:44,957
[phone ringing]

1033
01:04:45,391 --> 01:04:46,392
Yeah.

1034
01:04:48,961 --> 01:04:50,195
Got it. On my way.

1035
01:04:52,232 --> 01:04:54,334
[engine rumbling]

1036
01:05:10,048 --> 01:05:12,352
[engines rumbling]

1037
01:05:36,074 --> 01:05:38,010
[Toby] That man
was here to kill us, Roy.

1038
01:05:38,710 --> 01:05:42,147
You did the right thing.
Saved our lives.

1039
01:05:43,383 --> 01:05:46,051
What happened to my sister?

1040
01:05:48,354 --> 01:05:49,888
She's dead.

1041
01:05:54,092 --> 01:05:55,328
[somber music]

1042
01:05:57,297 --> 01:06:00,199
That's all that matters.
She's dead.

1043
01:06:00,732 --> 01:06:02,000
[Grace] Who did it?

1044
01:06:05,037 --> 01:06:06,439
It's not that simple.

1045
01:06:08,106 --> 01:06:10,310
This all has something to do
with what you're cooking

1046
01:06:10,343 --> 01:06:12,010
down in the dungeon, doesn't it?

1047
01:06:12,312 --> 01:06:13,946
It was Brigit's idea.

1048
01:06:16,848 --> 01:06:17,849
She had a vision.

1049
01:06:18,451 --> 01:06:20,219
Really owe it all to you, Toby.

1050
01:06:20,253 --> 01:06:21,220
Bullshit.

1051
01:06:22,422 --> 01:06:23,489
[Keats] She was inspired by you.

1052
01:06:26,459 --> 01:06:30,028
She saw you getting high
behind the group home.

1053
01:06:30,463 --> 01:06:32,498
[intense music]

1054
01:06:34,534 --> 01:06:36,369
[somber music]

1055
01:06:37,970 --> 01:06:40,306
All you do is lie, Keats.

1056
01:06:42,174 --> 01:06:43,309
And you, Grace.

1057
01:06:45,478 --> 01:06:48,013
She saw how
unafraid you were of violence.

1058
01:06:49,848 --> 01:06:53,852
She wanted to find something
that would bring you peace.

1059
01:06:56,522 --> 01:06:58,023
But you need to understand.

1060
01:06:59,525 --> 01:07:02,362
The future pharmaceuticals
is all for the taking.

1061
01:07:03,463 --> 01:07:04,930
Once upon a time,

1062
01:07:05,764 --> 01:07:11,003
cartels built their empires
strictly on marijuana.

1063
01:07:11,404 --> 01:07:15,907
And then, they saw
the coastal elites and posers,

1064
01:07:16,942 --> 01:07:18,244
their appetite for blow.

1065
01:07:19,479 --> 01:07:21,381
Then the Brit Brigade brought E.

1066
01:07:21,748 --> 01:07:25,551
<i>Brought it from the raves
to the clubs.</i>

1067
01:07:25,585 --> 01:07:26,852
[pulsing dance music]

1068
01:07:28,254 --> 01:07:29,422
And the cartels...

1069
01:07:30,523 --> 01:07:32,224
shifted to heroin.

1070
01:07:33,992 --> 01:07:37,996
And oxycontin was being
prescribed wholesale.

1071
01:07:40,165 --> 01:07:42,067
So the cartels innovated.

1072
01:07:43,035 --> 01:07:46,872
Started to cut that demon drug,
fentanyl into every damn thing

1073
01:07:47,573 --> 01:07:49,509
and everyone was
pitching a hissy fit.

1074
01:07:52,878 --> 01:07:55,448
Not to mention
those gay vegans in Los Angeles

1075
01:07:55,881 --> 01:07:58,451
worried about all the additives
in their orange juice,

1076
01:07:58,484 --> 01:08:00,520
but they couldn't even pronounce
half the damn shit

1077
01:08:00,553 --> 01:08:02,522
that was in their fucking drugs.

1078
01:08:02,888 --> 01:08:05,057
[Toby] Get to the point, Keats.

1079
01:08:06,124 --> 01:08:08,494
[somber music]

1080
01:08:08,528 --> 01:08:13,299
She started off working for me
that summer stacking shelves.

1081
01:08:14,634 --> 01:08:16,536
Within a month,
she was running the place.

1082
01:08:19,037 --> 01:08:20,406
She would always ask me

1083
01:08:20,740 --> 01:08:24,410
mountains of questions
about...'bout the business.

1084
01:08:26,912 --> 01:08:28,481
For a moment,
I thought she was...

1085
01:08:29,081 --> 01:08:31,451
trying to figure out
how to create a meth lab.

1086
01:08:33,653 --> 01:08:36,556
But I knew
she was smarter than that.

1087
01:08:37,222 --> 01:08:40,460
You're not just cooking up
any old Dilaudid down there.

1088
01:08:42,528 --> 01:08:45,431
- You're experimenting.
- Innovating!

1089
01:08:46,666 --> 01:08:49,201
- Brigit was a pioneer.
- [chuckles]

1090
01:08:51,136 --> 01:08:52,538
[Keats] She told me her idea.

1091
01:08:55,274 --> 01:08:59,612
We needed capital to
build her labs, you know?

1092
01:08:59,945 --> 01:09:02,348
<i>Pharmaceutical components
and shit like that.</i>

1093
01:09:03,982 --> 01:09:05,451
<i>And I introduced her
to Charles.</i>

1094
01:09:08,421 --> 01:09:12,492
I borrowed money for him.
Long time ago.

1095
01:09:15,661 --> 01:09:17,129
<i>He liked Brigit's idea.</i>

1096
01:09:19,164 --> 01:09:20,299
<i>He liked it a lot.</i>

1097
01:09:25,304 --> 01:09:29,007
<i>We was already into
some shady shit, but...</i>

1098
01:09:30,309 --> 01:09:31,444
[Roy] <i>But what?</i>

1099
01:09:34,146 --> 01:09:35,648
Charles is a diligent man.

1100
01:09:38,618 --> 01:09:39,886
He wanted to know how this
new drug

1101
01:09:39,918 --> 01:09:44,257
that would be the ecstasy of
the 2000s could be transported.

1102
01:09:46,359 --> 01:09:49,094
- [coughs]
- [Keats] Well, Brigit went out,

1103
01:09:49,395 --> 01:09:50,929
did some research.

1104
01:09:53,031 --> 01:09:54,400
She started to think that...

1105
01:09:55,368 --> 01:09:59,171
traveling musicians...
would be the answer,

1106
01:09:59,839 --> 01:10:02,575
and they would be the best way
to transport the new drug.

1107
01:10:02,608 --> 01:10:04,544
[music continues]

1108
01:10:06,512 --> 01:10:08,247
[no audio]

1109
01:10:08,681 --> 01:10:10,148
[Keats]
<i>That's where you came in, Roy.</i>

1110
01:10:11,149 --> 01:10:13,453
The only reason she was
at that bar that night, Roy,

1111
01:10:13,486 --> 01:10:14,986
was to see what she could see.

1112
01:10:16,756 --> 01:10:18,156
Then she'd sell you.

1113
01:10:20,426 --> 01:10:21,627
<i>She used you.</i>

1114
01:10:21,661 --> 01:10:25,331
[sirens wailing]

1115
01:10:26,699 --> 01:10:27,733
[Keats]
<i>After you hit Charles,</i>

1116
01:10:28,200 --> 01:10:30,035
<i>you were the perfect Patsy
for him.</i>

1117
01:10:31,102 --> 01:10:32,705
<i>Anyone who asked about Brigit,</i>

1118
01:10:32,905 --> 01:10:36,776
<i>Charles could say that it
must have been her violent ex,</i>

1119
01:10:36,809 --> 01:10:38,444
<i>even without evidence.</i>

1120
01:10:39,211 --> 01:10:42,248
<i>He had an influence
everywhere, cops, judges.</i>

1121
01:10:42,815 --> 01:10:44,717
<i>It was all too easy for him.</i>

1122
01:10:45,518 --> 01:10:49,755
<i>And town drunk Sheriff Ben was
happy to look the other way.</i>

1123
01:10:49,789 --> 01:10:52,157
<i>We all knew he was
the worst cop in the country.</i>

1124
01:10:52,792 --> 01:10:54,627
<i>Couldn't even see
half the cops in the county</i>

1125
01:10:54,660 --> 01:10:55,561
<i>were on Charles's payroll.</i>

1126
01:11:00,131 --> 01:11:02,468
[Kyle] You're lyin'.
These are all lies.

1127
01:11:02,802 --> 01:11:06,639
My dad's a good man.
He can't be doing this.

1128
01:11:09,140 --> 01:11:10,676
I have no reason to lie.

1129
01:11:11,744 --> 01:11:12,411
Not anymore.

1130
01:11:12,879 --> 01:11:17,350
So, you, Brigit, and Charles
were business partners?

1131
01:11:17,650 --> 01:11:18,718
And Silas.

1132
01:11:19,685 --> 01:11:21,354
There's always a Silas.

1133
01:11:22,688 --> 01:11:24,323
<i>Someone to do
their dirty work.</i>

1134
01:11:26,559 --> 01:11:28,327
As I started to make headway,

1135
01:11:30,263 --> 01:11:31,597
Charles saw the potential.

1136
01:11:34,433 --> 01:11:35,635
[whispers] He got greedy.

1137
01:11:38,771 --> 01:11:40,606
He invited Brigit here
one night.

1138
01:11:43,242 --> 01:11:44,477
And she never made it.

1139
01:11:46,812 --> 01:11:49,315
[tense music]

1140
01:11:52,818 --> 01:11:54,754
[Keats] <i>Silas pulled her over
in the sheriff's cruiser.</i>

1141
01:11:57,256 --> 01:11:58,691
[sobbing]
<i>I never saw her again.</i>

1142
01:11:59,625 --> 01:12:01,260
[no audio]

1143
01:12:04,864 --> 01:12:06,632
I don't know
what happened after that.

1144
01:12:07,667 --> 01:12:09,435
[music continues]

1145
01:12:09,735 --> 01:12:10,803
[Keats sobs]

1146
01:12:11,437 --> 01:12:12,772
I don't know
what happened after...

1147
01:12:13,272 --> 01:12:15,374
[flames whooshing]

1148
01:12:15,408 --> 01:12:16,742
[Keats]
<i>Meanwhile, Charles told Ben</i>

1149
01:12:16,776 --> 01:12:17,843
<i>to stop the investigation.</i>

1150
01:12:18,377 --> 01:12:20,178
<i>The town moved on.</i>

1151
01:12:20,813 --> 01:12:23,649
<i>Everyone except you three
and me.</i>

1152
01:12:24,884 --> 01:12:26,586
<i>Brigit was my apprentice.</i>

1153
01:12:26,886 --> 01:12:28,354
<i>My friend.</i>

[tense music]

1159
01:13:29,715 --> 01:13:31,450
Answer the phone, Ben.

1160
01:13:32,418 --> 01:13:33,419
Fuck!

1161
01:13:44,797 --> 01:13:46,932
[thunder rumbling]

1162
01:14:08,487 --> 01:14:09,789
Let's trade!

1163
01:14:10,956 --> 01:14:13,292
We'll give you free passes out.

1164
01:14:14,694 --> 01:14:15,928
Just give us Kyle.

1165
01:14:17,596 --> 01:14:19,197
We'll stand down.

1166
01:14:21,934 --> 01:14:23,602
Give you my word.

1167
01:14:26,372 --> 01:14:27,807
[Kyle]
I'll corroborate everything.

1168
01:14:28,274 --> 01:14:30,242
You just gotta wait for
the FBI boys to get here

1169
01:14:30,276 --> 01:14:32,778
and I'll... I'll back everything
you say, I swear.

1170
01:14:34,680 --> 01:14:35,815
Does the sheriff know
about Brigit?

1171
01:14:36,649 --> 01:14:38,384
No, no.

1172
01:14:38,417 --> 01:14:41,320
We keep the sheriff and Kyle
in the dark about everything.

1173
01:14:41,821 --> 01:14:44,356
It's good cover for Charles
to have a son as a deputy.

1174
01:14:44,857 --> 01:14:46,792
Everybody knows
that Kyle's a dumbass.

1175
01:14:48,694 --> 01:14:50,863
[Kyle]
My dad's a man of his word.

1176
01:14:52,465 --> 01:14:53,799
You just let me go and he'll...

1177
01:14:54,266 --> 01:14:56,969
he'll let you guys free,
I... I promise.

1178
01:15:03,743 --> 01:15:06,011
You best keep your word, Kyle.

1179
01:15:07,880 --> 01:15:08,881
[whispers] You hear me?

1180
01:15:11,517 --> 01:15:12,818
[grunts]

1181
01:15:14,687 --> 01:15:18,858
Get outta here. Get!
Run to your daddy.

1182
01:15:26,031 --> 01:15:27,500
I'm sorry.

1183
01:15:30,870 --> 01:15:32,571
I don't know what for, but...

1184
01:15:33,739 --> 01:15:34,740
I'm sorry.

1185
01:15:53,359 --> 01:15:55,027
[Charles] Walk to me, son.

1186
01:15:59,131 --> 01:16:00,666
You gonna keep your promise?

1187
01:16:06,672 --> 01:16:08,641
You gave your word
you'd let them go.

1188
01:16:09,742 --> 01:16:10,910
Come on, now.

1189
01:16:12,511 --> 01:16:14,013
Just a little further.

1190
01:16:15,481 --> 01:16:17,082
Don't be a pigeon of peace, son.

1191
01:16:17,383 --> 01:16:19,919
[tense music]

1192
01:16:37,870 --> 01:16:38,971
[Kyle] You're gonna let them go.

1193
01:16:42,575 --> 01:16:45,878
- [Charles] Doctor Keats alive?
- He is.

1194
01:16:48,113 --> 01:16:49,815
Let them pass.

1195
01:16:51,150 --> 01:16:52,952
Let them pass
or when the FBI arrive,

1196
01:16:52,985 --> 01:16:54,053
I'll tell 'em everything.

1197
01:16:58,824 --> 01:16:59,959
You don't mean that.

1198
01:17:03,162 --> 01:17:04,430
I swear it.

1199
01:17:06,098 --> 01:17:07,666
I swear on my life.

1200
01:17:08,301 --> 01:17:10,035
On Mom's grave, I swear it.

1201
01:17:13,138 --> 01:17:15,574

What are they doing?
No, no! Get me outta here.

1207
01:17:57,082 --> 01:17:58,150
[whispers] Fucking kidding me?

1208
01:18:01,020 --> 01:18:02,154
Get this done.

1209
01:18:02,621 --> 01:18:05,925
Kill them all, burn the lab.
FBI is 8 minutes out.

1210

[gunshots firing]

1211
01:18:22,107 --> 01:18:23,075
Cut him loose, Roy.

1212
01:18:25,044 --> 01:18:27,146
If we can get to the lab,
we may be able to hold them off.

[Grace gasping] Keats got hit!

1215

Toby, he's hit!

<i>Marisa, it's me.</i>

Hey. Hey!

Stop!

1233
01:21:23,956 --> 01:21:26,191
Let's get these fuckers
for Toby.

[gunshots firing]

1235
01:21:30,463 --> 01:21:32,398

waste of space.</i>

Hold still, motherfucker.

1240
01:22:17,510 --> 01:22:18,877
[Charles] Hey!

1241
01:22:19,312 --> 01:22:21,146
Where the fuck d'you think
you're going?

1242
01:22:34,826 --> 01:22:38,931
Ben. How come shit
always lands on top?

1243
01:22:40,400 --> 01:22:41,967
It's over, Charlie.

1244
01:22:43,101 --> 01:22:45,271
[both breathing heavily]

1245
01:22:50,142 --> 01:22:51,810

Christ.

1252
01:24:52,498 --> 01:24:54,099
How much did you know?

1253
01:24:55,133 --> 01:24:57,637
It was Keats and Charles.

1254
01:24:57,670 --> 01:24:59,339
[Roy] Keats ran the drugs.

1255
01:24:59,372 --> 01:25:00,972
But Silas killed Brigit.

1256
01:25:01,006 --> 01:25:02,342
He had your car that night.

1257
01:25:02,375 --> 01:25:04,076
I should have done more.

1258
01:25:04,377 --> 01:25:05,578
[Grace]
Yeah, you fucking should have.

1259
01:25:06,078 --> 01:25:07,447
And now you're bleeding.

1260
01:25:08,448 --> 01:25:09,549
It ain't my blood.

1261
01:25:10,483 --> 01:25:11,584
[Grace] You sure about that?

1262
01:25:12,452 --> 01:25:17,357
[Ben] The feds are almost here.
So go, you're free.

01:26:10,410 --> 01:26:11,511
[Ben] Marisa.

1266
01:26:13,145 --> 01:26:14,480
You were never here.

1267
01:26:19,552 --> 01:26:22,321
<i>If anyone asks,
I found a drug den.</i>

1268
01:26:24,222 --> 01:26:25,525
<i>Fought off the army.</i>

1269
01:26:27,993 --> 01:26:29,495
I'm the hero.

1270
01:26:30,596 --> 01:26:32,298
Big shiny hero.

1271
01:26:47,346 --> 01:26:49,549
