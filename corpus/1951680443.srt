00:02:31,885 --> 00:02:34,012
- What happened?
- Nothing.

3
00:02:36,623 --> 00:02:39,091
When I was your age
I was captain!

4
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,626
I know.

5
00:02:52,272 --> 00:02:55,503
I'm tired. That's enough.

6
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:06,718
His father was a tent maker. He was born
in Naishapur, Iran on May 18, 1048.

7
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:12,883
At age twelve,
he lost his father.

8
00:03:23,603 --> 00:03:28,006
From that moment, his friend Darya
was the only person

9
00:03:28,174 --> 00:03:34,079
other than his mother,
whom he could lean on.

10
00:08:22,702 --> 00:08:27,901
Hassan and Omar slowly became
close friends.

11
00:08:29,408 --> 00:08:33,572
Hassan's father treated Omar
like his own son.

12
00:08:44,991 --> 00:08:50,930
With Daya, their friendship
grew stronger.

13
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:09,408
Although the three of
them were inseparable,

14
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:19,317
Omar held a very special place
in his heart for Darya.

15
00:09:33,172 --> 00:09:41,170
As they grew older, their friendship was
viewed differently by the public.

16
00:09:42,648 --> 00:09:45,879
YEARS LATER

17
00:15:20,886 --> 00:15:24,447
Hassan and Omar did not realize at the time

18
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:30,495
how their friendship with a slave girl
would impact their lives.

20
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:13,019
Eat.

21
00:18:14,126 --> 00:18:18,324
You cannot save the boy
by starving.

22
00:18:28,807 --> 00:18:32,766
Mother, let us pray for Nader.

23
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:36,574
If her son dies,

24
00:18:37,316 --> 00:18:40,285
I'll be devastated
for my sister, Shahin.

25
00:18:41,653 --> 00:18:43,951
Her heart is with the Iran of the past,

26
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:50,057
but Mansour only thinks
about the future.

27
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:04,300
Kamran is not going.

28
00:21:34,326 --> 00:21:37,261
We must show this to
grandfather.

29
00:21:37,396 --> 00:21:41,730
It's important for him to know that
we still remember Omar.

30
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:50,138
Both Hassan and Omar searched
and searched...

31
00:21:50,409 --> 00:21:52,502
...but didn't find her.

32
00:21:52,944 --> 00:21:56,573
Neither would ever
get over their love for her.

33
00:21:57,115 --> 00:22:00,346
For Hassan, love
was no longer important.

34
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:05,684
The only thing left fo him was his
faith in God and his religion.

35
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:40,447
Persia came under the control of
Muslim Turks known as Seljuks.

36
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:46,998
Malikshah became the new
leader of the Seljuks.

37
00:22:55,173 --> 00:23:00,042
The root of Seljuk power was granted
by the religion of Islam.

38
00:23:01,613 --> 00:23:04,946
This alarmed the European
Byzantines...

39
00:23:05,083 --> 00:23:10,077
who came to the regio spreading
Christianity and their own authority.

40
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:48,257
Hello Shahin

41
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:49,933
Hello Cyrus

42
00:27:52,437 --> 00:27:54,462
I miss you very much.

43
00:27:54,606 --> 00:27:55,664
I miss you too.

44
00:27:56,007 --> 00:27:56,974
How's Nader?

45
00:27:57,108 --> 00:27:58,939
He's so pale!

46
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:01,073
Mother is very worried.

47
00:28:01,212 --> 00:28:03,442
What about his
white blood cell count?

48
00:28:03,948 --> 00:28:06,473
I have to go back
to the hospital.

49
00:28:06,618 --> 00:28:09,712
I'll call you tomorrow.

50
00:34:56,394 --> 00:35:02,924
Gradually, Hassan and Omar were
going their separate ways.

51
00:46:08,432 --> 00:46:12,630
The hearts of two lovers can
never be apart from one another.

52
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:18,709
That's how Darya's love found its
way back to Omar.

53
00:52:40,690 --> 00:52:46,686
As Malikshah prepared to defend
against advancing Christian armies,

54
00:52:48,064 --> 00:52:53,696
a radical Islamic group threatened to
unseat him from within his Empire.

55
00:52:54,738 --> 00:53:01,075
Hope and love died inside Omar
when he could not find Darya.

56
00:55:07,137 --> 00:55:11,597
Poor Shahin,
I feel very badly for her.

57
00:55:12,809 --> 00:55:15,972
Mansour is so headstrong.

58
00:55:17,180 --> 00:55:23,608
Kamran is the Keeper now.

59
00:55:26,456 --> 00:55:31,052
Shahin has not forgotten.

60
00:55:35,432 --> 00:55:38,333
We must not
upset your father.

61
00:55:38,802 --> 00:55:43,865
It would kill his spirit.

62
00:55:45,575 --> 00:55:50,740
Try calling them again
tomorrow.

63
01:09:36,105 --> 01:09:40,201
Shahin, don't worry.
I've got a visa for England.

64
01:09:41,277 --> 01:09:44,371
Give me her address
and telephone.
