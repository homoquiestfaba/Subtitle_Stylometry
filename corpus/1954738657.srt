I think you need to take
a break from your book.

784

I think the pressure's
getting to you.

785
00:44:35,272 --> 00:44:36,272
It's okay.

786
00:45:20,684 --> 00:45:24,387
Now, my reasons for drinking
were almost occupational.

787
00:45:24,389 --> 00:45:26,022
I was a psychiatrist.
And being a psychiatrist,

788
00:45:26,024 --> 00:45:27,724
I listened to people's problems

789
00:45:27,726 --> 00:45:30,927
all the time every day all... you
know, on top of my own.

790
00:45:30,929 --> 00:45:32,562
Then of course, my alcoholism.

791
00:45:32,564 --> 00:45:36,365
All I... I felt
that drinking was, um,

792
00:45:36,367 --> 00:45:37,834
my escape,

793
00:45:37,836 --> 00:45:39,902
um, that I deserved it.

794
00:45:41,071 --> 00:45:44,307
And so I started to drink.

795
00:45:45,843 --> 00:45:47,009
And...

796
00:45:48,746 --> 00:45:51,447
I got lost.

797
00:45:51,449 --> 00:45:52,949
I got very lost,

798
00:45:52,951 --> 00:45:55,051
and I lost many things.

799
00:45:55,053 --> 00:45:56,586
I lost everything.

800
00:45:56,588 --> 00:45:59,122
I lost my job,

801
00:45:59,124 --> 00:46:01,524
lost my wife.

802
00:46:04,294 --> 00:46:06,929
I lost my reputation.

803
00:46:06,931 --> 00:46:09,432
I lost my dignity.

804
00:46:09,434 --> 00:46:12,635
I was humiliated beyond
any reasonable measure.

805
00:46:14,037 --> 00:46:15,972
I lost my kids.

806
00:46:18,275 --> 00:46:20,476
Did that stop me? No.

807
00:46:22,379 --> 00:46:24,380
See, I couldn't accept the fact

808
00:46:24,382 --> 00:46:28,117
that I loved the next drink more
than I loved my own children.

809
00:46:29,419 --> 00:46:31,687
But I did...

810
00:46:32,923 --> 00:46:34,657
then.

811
00:46:34,659 --> 00:46:37,760
And we all know that getting
sober is just half the battle.

812
00:46:37,762 --> 00:46:41,597
It's staying sober,
staying sober.

813
00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:43,499
Ladies and gentlemen, staying
sober is the hardest thing.

814
00:46:43,501 --> 00:46:45,635
It's the hardest part,

815
00:46:45,637 --> 00:46:47,303
and it's the hardest thing I've
ever done, and it is

816
00:46:47,305 --> 00:46:50,473
We can all come up with an
excuse to have a drink,

817
00:46:50,475 --> 00:46:51,240
for God's sake.

818
00:46:51,242 --> 00:46:52,508

You feel bad.

You feel happy.

820
00:46:53,978 --> 00:46:56,779
Hey, there's always a reason to
have a celebration with

821
00:46:56,781 --> 00:46:57,613
a dry martini,

822
00:46:57,615 --> 00:46:59,615
but the problem
with people like us

823
00:46:59,617 --> 00:47:01,250
is that one martini
leads to another martini.

824
00:47:01,252 --> 00:47:02,785
It leads to a scotch
on the rocks.

825
00:47:02,787 --> 00:47:04,320
It leads to a... in my case,

826
00:47:04,322 --> 00:47:08,324
the crystal methamphetamine,
and then it's over.

827
00:47:08,326 --> 00:47:11,627
Many of you know my journey to
sobriety in these last 11 years,

828
00:47:11,629 --> 00:47:14,430
and I'd be less than honest
if I were to say to you

829
00:47:14,432 --> 00:47:16,833
that I haven't wanted to have a
drink many, many times.

831
00:47:19,369 --> 00:47:21,671
But I think.

832
00:47:21,673 --> 00:47:25,741
I sit down, and I think about
what I've been through...

833
00:47:27,978 --> 00:47:32,114
and all my family
and my friends

834
00:47:32,116 --> 00:47:34,483
and the people that I love

and that stuck by me
have been through.

836
00:47:39,357 --> 00:47:43,292

that I might be slipping...

like the rabid dog you are.

1449
01:33:44,151 --> 01:33:47,320
Save the county
the cost of your trial.

1450
01:33:47,322 --> 01:33:48,688
Do it.

1451
01:33:53,794 --> 01:33:56,129
But unlike you,
I don't fancy myself

1452
01:33:56,131 --> 01:33:59,132
a judge, jury, and executioner.

1453
01:33:59,134 --> 01:34:01,635
No, you're just a pussy.

1454
01:34:01,637 --> 01:34:03,503
You're a fucking embarrassment.

1455
01:34:03,505 --> 01:34:06,406
You got your little brown
shirt and your khaki pants

1456
01:34:06,408 --> 01:34:08,675
and your big shiny badge
and your pistol.

1457
01:34:08,677 --> 01:34:11,244
You can't shoot to kill.

1458
01:34:11,246 --> 01:34:13,580
You have no idea

1459
01:34:13,582 --> 01:34:16,349
about the thrill,

1460
01:34:16,351 --> 01:34:21,855
about the rush
of taking a human life.

1461
01:34:21,857 --> 01:34:24,024
Only two people know that,

1462
01:34:24,026 --> 01:34:26,693
two people,

1463
01:34:26,695 --> 01:34:29,596
God and me.

1464
01:34:29,598 --> 01:34:30,697
You're insane.

1465
01:34:30,699 --> 01:34:33,533
All that's left

1466
01:34:33,535 --> 01:34:35,769
is to flush you away forever

1467
01:34:35,771 --> 01:34:38,004
like the piece of shit you are.

1468
01:34:40,041 --> 01:34:42,042
Are you sure
about that, Sheriff?

1469
01:34:43,444 --> 01:34:46,046
Because I'm
just getting started.

1470
01:34:51,619 --> 01:34:54,220
[ laughing ]

1471
01:35:12,640 --> 01:35:14,574
[ instrumental playing ]
