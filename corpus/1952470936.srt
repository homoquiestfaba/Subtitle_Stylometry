00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:22,897
A hippie is someone who seems Tarzan,
runs as Jane and smells like Cheetah.

2
00:00:46,655 --> 00:00:49,420
Put your right hand on your other arm.

3
00:00:50,819 --> 00:00:52,555
Are you ready?

4
00:00:52,967 --> 00:00:59,582
I swear allegiance to the flag
of the United States of America

5
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:02,290
Cries of pain.

6
00:01:02,977 --> 00:01:05,247
Soldiers signed for life.

7
00:01:05,779 --> 00:01:07,611
The devastation.

8
00:01:08,299 --> 00:01:13,564
Maybe we become accustomed
to wars in which films are shown.

9
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:20,196
But here is the reality show, and
since you do not hear victory music.

10
00:01:20,197 --> 00:01:27,319
There are no heroes. This is the reality
and we see only people suffering.

11
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:30,712
These wars are neither glamoureus,
nor romantic.

12
00:01:31,101 --> 00:01:36,399
They are only memories,
the brutality of man.

13
00:01:36,872 --> 00:01:40,229
And let there be no doubt about that,

14
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:46,934
that this war and perhaps all wars,
absolute "evil" represented.

15
00:01:46,935 --> 00:01:51,271
Northern California 1967

16
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:02,663
I will give you half,
so you r still have tomorrow.

17
00:02:09,744 --> 00:02:12,593
When my today's opinion
Governor Reagan asked ...

18
00:02:12,594 --> 00:02:16,546
... 's proposal for the extension
's national park.

19
00:02:16,547 --> 00:02:18,808
Was his answer, and I quote:

20
00:02:18,809 --> 00:02:20,852
"A tree is just a tree."

21
00:02:20,876 --> 00:02:23,023
"And there are enough trees."

22
00:02:23,761 --> 00:02:25,240
Other news are ...

23
00:02:28,356 --> 00:02:29,352
Hello?

24
00:02:30,822 --> 00:02:33,112
I'm coming.

25
00:02:33,744 --> 00:02:35,666
Come on son, we must leave.

26
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:19,078
What's going on, Burke?

27
00:03:19,356 --> 00:03:21,986
They keep coming back.
How can we work?

28
00:03:23,068 --> 00:03:24,542
Visit them go.

29
00:03:25,968 --> 00:03:27,929
You heard him. Restart your machine.

30
00:03:36,209 --> 00:03:39,612
You know why we fell trees?
In order to build houses.

31
00:03:39,706 --> 00:03:42,978
For families. That I may not care.

32
00:03:44,839 --> 00:03:47,758
My wife is sick. She needed medication.

33
00:03:48,237 --> 00:03:51,048
And if they do not get, it will die.

34
00:03:51,819 --> 00:03:55,024
You make it all possible
to be fair to earn his bread.

35
00:03:55,025 --> 00:03:57,711
If your wife should die,
to save trees ...

36
00:03:59,033 --> 00:04:00,204
... then is it so.

37
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:02,230
You ...

38
00:04:02,231 --> 00:04:04,101
And who will you save?

39
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,181
Bastard!

40
00:04:11,188 --> 00:04:12,219
Is everything okay?

41
00:04:22,175 --> 00:04:24,375
If everyone wants to come to rest.
Give it here.

42
00:04:25,056 --> 00:04:26,672
He has distributed the first battle.

43
00:04:26,712 --> 00:04:28,118
He started it.

44
00:04:28,698 --> 00:04:30,747
Can a man not even carry his job?

45
00:04:30,748 --> 00:04:31,823
I got you caught in the act.

46
00:04:31,958 --> 00:04:33,704
Everything is good, boy.

47
00:04:33,787 --> 00:04:37,805
We stay here until we petition
to save these trees.

48
00:04:37,806 --> 00:04:40,932
And where is that petition?
Paper, you idiot.

49
00:04:40,933 --> 00:04:42,366
This is made of trees.

50
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:45,843
Not trees,
but 't body of Christ.

51
00:05:06,276 --> 00:05:09,405
I kill you all.
I swear 't.

52
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,685
Papa!

00:05:59,157 --> 00:06:00,862
Rome louder delicacy.

55
00:06:01,868 --> 00:06:03,134
Should you not in the way 't mind?

56
00:06:03,135 --> 00:06:04,135
No.

57
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:05,706
I will be driving.

58
00:06:07,157 --> 00:06:09,341
The drugs keep Joey sharp.

59
00:06:09,673 --> 00:06:10,910
Not, dude?

60
00:06:16,591 --> 00:06:18,221
Thanks, but I have nothing.

61
00:06:21,984 --> 00:06:22,816
Sam.

62
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:25,700
See that nest at the top of the tree?

63
00:06:28,031 --> 00:06:28,868
Yes.

64
00:06:28,869 --> 00:06:31,056
That 's nest' s American bald eagle.

65
00:06:31,654 --> 00:06:34,804
I would not disturb you, but I want a pee break.

66
00:06:34,805 --> 00:06:35,805
Me too.

67
00:06:37,736 --> 00:06:41,571
Please, 't toilet of the bus.

68
00:06:41,572 --> 00:06:42,910
This bowl is leaking.

69
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:45,647
With a little practice will 't you get it.

70
00:06:45,648 --> 00:06:46,948
Joey, beware.

71
00:06:57,586 --> 00:06:59,051
What was that?

72
00:06:59,052 --> 00:07:00,152
I think that 't' n dog was.

73
00:07:00,153 --> 00:07:01,652
Do you? I hate dogs.

74
00:07:01,653 --> 00:07:03,260
Who hates dogs now?

75
00:07:03,609 --> 00:07:05,085
He is likely to walk.

76
00:07:05,086 --> 00:07:07,269
The girl toilet is on the right
big boy.

77
00:07:07,918 --> 00:07:11,086
Chuck, come with me.
Sorry, I am also afraid of dogs.

78
00:07:11,087 --> 00:07:12,971
You're such a chicken.

79
00:07:36,101 --> 00:07:38,831
Someone is your 's buzz.
What?

80
00:07:39,032 --> 00:07:41,552
Your cellphone rings. Who is it?

81
00:07:42,797 --> 00:07:43,812
Nobody.

82
00:07:45,774 --> 00:07:47,877
Is everything okay?

83
00:07:48,041 --> 00:07:49,398
Yes, I think it does.

84
00:07:50,603 --> 00:07:52,946
While Jimmy is not in my area.

85
00:07:53,361 --> 00:07:55,980
You will love this trip.

86
00:07:57,779 --> 00:07:59,341
Beware of traps.

87
00:07:59,342 --> 00:08:00,663
Beware of what?

88
00:08:00,664 --> 00:08:02,088
Traps.

89
00:08:02,089 --> 00:08:03,515
What ... where?

90
00:08:04,019 --> 00:08:04,860
What fall ...

91
00:08:07,842 --> 00:08:09,261
I am concerned.

92
00:08:13,626 --> 00:08:17,148
I am so clumsy.
There should be no glass still in it.

93
00:08:17,447 --> 00:08:19,310
Who the hell were those guys?

94
00:08:19,311 --> 00:08:21,259
I do not know, but we
be careful.

95
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:24,325
If these guys we get,
they cut our balls off ...

96
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,352
... and they use it as fertilizer
for their crocodiles.

97
00:08:26,353 --> 00:08:29,590
Sounds like the perfect place
to a music festival there.

98
00:08:30,513 --> 00:08:33,845
Jesus Christ, Samantha.
- That was not my intention.

99
00:08:34,942 --> 00:08:36,189
It hurts.

100
00:08:36,963 --> 00:08:39,042
I can 't stitch, if you want?

101
00:08:39,283 --> 00:08:40,043
What?

102
00:08:40,044 --> 00:08:42,076
I have a needle and thread.

103
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:45,595
I warm it up.

104
00:08:46,012 --> 00:08:48,451
So it is sterile.
- No, thanks.

105
00:08:48,403 --> 00:08:50,109
Let him do sissy.

106
00:08:50,146 --> 00:08:53,525
Otherwise it will ignite.
- That is disgusting.

107
00:08:53,476 --> 00:08:55,476
Don 't.
- I'm okay.

108
00:08:56,703 --> 00:08:57,961
On his Rambo's.

109
00:08:57,962 --> 00:09:02,171
The wound is too deep.
We must 't disinfection.

110
00:09:04,091 --> 00:09:05,692
Give me the whiskey again.

111
00:09:06,361 --> 00:09:10,370
Rambo!

112
00:09:15,753 --> 00:09:16,854
Do it!

113
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,664
I'm Rambo.

114
00:09:25,381 --> 00:09:26,729
I'm Rambo!

115
00:09:42,764 --> 00:09:45,664
I can 't respect. I feel dizzy.

116
00:09:48,457 --> 00:09:55,921
Value countrymen, many battles
are at end of the war in Iraq ...

117
00:09:57,517 --> 00:10:00,133
He is not only
the best American president ever.

118
00:10:00,134 --> 00:10:01,634
He is just ...

119
00:10:08,664 --> 00:10:11,164
That will be a scar be.

120
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:13,880
Thanks, I get some medicine.

121
00:10:14,874 --> 00:10:16,329
Who wants high?

122
00:10:29,273 --> 00:10:32,409
What is wrong with her?
Like them a trauma has occurred.

123
00:10:32,441 --> 00:10:34,177
Sam?
Yes.

124
00:10:34,242 --> 00:10:36,928
She 's currently difficult.
- How are you?

125
00:10:37,548 --> 00:10:40,035
Did Ivan 't you not told?
- No.

126
00:10:40,618 --> 00:10:42,339
She was not always so shy.

127
00:10:42,813 --> 00:10:45,597
She has had a bad relationship.

128
00:10:47,536 --> 00:10:50,052
You are very much for your height.

129
00:10:51,326 --> 00:10:53,033
My ex-boyfriend ...

130
00:10:53,453 --> 00:10:56,395
... loved SM.

131
00:10:57,217 --> 00:10:58,973
Also Ossy?

132
00:10:58,974 --> 00:11:01,773
That liquid stuff
that we put our tongue ...

133
00:11:03,054 --> 00:11:05,436
That was no toothpaste.

134
00:11:23,901 --> 00:11:25,518
Jimmy was her last boyfriend.

135
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:28,468
A rich, spoiled kid
that it hated to be dumped.

136
00:11:28,469 --> 00:11:30,985
He was accustomed to receive his sentence.

137
00:11:30,986 --> 00:11:32,286
Samantha.

138
00:11:35,773 --> 00:11:39,397
What are you doing here, Jimmy?

139
00:11:39,405 --> 00:11:40,998
Jimmy, please.

140
00:11:45,508 --> 00:11:48,184
Got t verkloot?
- I do not know.

141
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:49,520
Have you given her drugs?

142
00:11:49,824 --> 00:11:53,891
Fuck you, Jimmy!
- You give me no orders, pig.

143
00:11:54,053 --> 00:11:58,168
Show her a little respect.
- She has only a bad influence on you.

144
00:11:58,179 --> 00:12:00,966
Fuck you, motherfucker!
- Why are you so angry?

145
00:12:02,019 --> 00:12:04,694
Why am I evil?

146
00:12:06,536 --> 00:12:08,017
Sammy was just a dagreis made ...

147
00:12:08,089 --> 00:12:10,789
... and when Jimmy found out,
lost his pedals.

148
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:12,648
I had asked you to stay here ...

149
00:12:12,737 --> 00:12:13,738
... and you did not.

150
00:12:13,739 --> 00:12:15,452
I don 't understand.
I love you, damn.

151
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:18,044
I love you, Samantha.

152
00:12:19,566 --> 00:12:21,783
You make yourself ridiculous.

153
00:12:32,072 --> 00:12:33,499
Help us!

154
00:13:02,283 --> 00:13:03,989
Everything you break, you buy.

155
00:13:07,771 --> 00:13:09,888
Jodie Foster acted great in that movie.

156
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:12,920
Not Jodie Foster, but "The Blair"
played with in "The Exorcist".

157
00:13:12,921 --> 00:13:16,514
Yes, with that priest and the demon possessed
was played by Reagan.

158
00:13:16,515 --> 00:13:18,221
But it was not President Reagan.

159
00:13:19,085 --> 00:13:21,535
I understand why you all wrong.

160
00:13:22,561 --> 00:13:23,500
Beer.

161
00:13:24,283 --> 00:13:25,521
Boose not everything.

162
00:13:25,622 --> 00:13:27,036
Where is Sam?

163
00:13:27,037 --> 00:13:28,854
In the shop.
- Get her out.

164
00:13:32,869 --> 00:13:35,075
You heard him. Boose not everything.

165
00:13:35,176 --> 00:13:36,476
Sam?

166
00:13:37,811 --> 00:13:38,920
Calm down, slokop.

167
00:13:42,263 --> 00:13:43,649
These are the guys.

168
00:13:46,212 --> 00:13:48,663
Let's go.
- You are in a bad mood.

169
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:52,749
Those guys from that truck are just stopped.

170
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:54,736
What?
- The guys who threw that bottle.

171
00:13:54,737 --> 00:13:57,734
What is your problem, dude?
Sit her down something in your vagina?

172
00:13:57,735 --> 00:13:59,129
Yes, the dick your mother.

173
00:13:59,462 --> 00:14:02,141
What does that mean now?
- I do not know.

174
00:14:11,281 --> 00:14:13,205
Five's like coffee.

175
00:14:13,206 --> 00:14:16,569
I want those guys murder.
- I would not do.

176
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:18,424
Why not. We are in the majority.

177
00:14:18,425 --> 00:14:22,216
I am not a fighter, and they may have weapons.

178
00:14:22,217 --> 00:14:24,556
That's the bastard
that my bottle has absorbed.

179
00:14:26,944 --> 00:14:29,120
Pussy.
- I'm like a sissy.

180
00:14:29,121 --> 00:14:30,460
Let's just leave.

181
00:14:31,048 --> 00:14:34,208
Hey, motherfuckers, you find problems?

182
00:14:37,306 --> 00:14:39,487
Because my friend asked 't away.

183
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:50,582
Are you big, lean kid?
- Will he fight?

184
00:14:52,665 --> 00:14:54,028
Thanks for your help, Johny.

185
00:14:54,029 --> 00:14:56,498
No problem.
I call a religious war on him.

186
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:57,927
Ivan.

187
00:15:01,445 --> 00:15:02,751
What is wrong?

188
00:15:03,925 --> 00:15:07,049
Tell them that we have no problems.
- But your boyfriend wants it.

189
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:09,491
What did you expect.
You have my head hurt.

190
00:15:09,559 --> 00:15:14,137
I thought you were peace-loving hippies.

191
00:15:14,138 --> 00:15:16,050
Friendship make no war.

192
00:15:17,449 --> 00:15:23,823
Turn around and go out,
I hurt for you to do.

193
00:15:23,824 --> 00:15:26,806
Stupid bastards, come on.
- As you wish.

194
00:15:28,515 --> 00:15:30,066
Not "t knife, Muff.

195
00:15:31,406 --> 00:15:33,585
Let's make some vegetarian burgers.

196
00:15:45,761 --> 00:15:48,186
Come on, baby.
Never mind what to see.

197
00:15:48,187 --> 00:15:49,587
Stay away from me!

198
00:16:04,652 --> 00:16:06,547
Thank you, sir.

199
00:16:22,795 --> 00:16:25,819
Hello?

200
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:30,408
Samantha?

201
00:16:31,075 --> 00:16:33,583
I know that you are.

202
00:16:33,584 --> 00:16:34,984
Say something.

203
00:16:39,217 --> 00:16:41,202
I can not believe
you holding me.

204
00:16:41,614 --> 00:16:44,689
Bitch you are.

205
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:46,090
Gus?

206
00:16:46,091 --> 00:16:51,854
Damn, Gus, rep your ass inside.
And continue with your work.

207
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:54,725
I love violence.

208
00:16:56,930 --> 00:17:01,127
Damn, I knew she 's aunt was hard.

209
00:17:01,128 --> 00:17:03,372
He did not know what happened to him.

210
00:17:03,992 --> 00:17:07,324
Who?
- Just Mr. T, Rocky.

211
00:17:07,768 --> 00:17:09,028
Winnie the Pooh.

212
00:17:09,568 --> 00:17:11,587
I never knew you had so much guts.

213
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,016
Why have I brought you,
because you know absolutely nothing.

214
00:17:17,017 --> 00:17:18,663
Because I have good uitzie.

215
00:17:40,134 --> 00:17:42,523
Gentlemen! There is a saying.

216
00:17:43,612 --> 00:17:45,944
Rome was not built in a day.

217
00:17:46,009 --> 00:17:48,118
But I have a saying.

218
00:17:48,119 --> 00:17:49,519
Fuck you, Rome.

219
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:51,263
This is America!

220
00:17:51,539 --> 00:17:53,261
We do what we sense in it.

221
00:17:53,858 --> 00:17:55,660
So you need not have worried.

222
00:17:55,661 --> 00:17:57,953
We will track here on Monday.

223
00:17:57,954 --> 00:18:01,605
And your forest will remain untouched.

224
00:18:02,429 --> 00:18:05,925
Mr. Baker, you have a great crew with him.

225
00:18:06,544 --> 00:18:09,246
Call me Frank, please.

226
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,835
We have only ...

227
00:18:11,899 --> 00:18:13,479
... a few concerns.

228
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:17,180
In connection with ...
- What? Admission tickets, revenues, ... ?

229
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,189
Fatalities.

230
00:18:22,548 --> 00:18:25,289
There are a few spectators died,
last year.

231
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:28,562
I do not think we have met each other.

232
00:18:29,824 --> 00:18:34,120
May I introduce you to agent Buzz Hall,
Mr. Baker.

233
00:18:34,483 --> 00:18:36,834
Peace on the supervisors of the city.

234
00:18:37,065 --> 00:18:38,218
Supervisors?

235
00:18:38,241 --> 00:18:41,288
We do not have much money
to security spending.

236
00:18:41,352 --> 00:18:45,233
Then you really do
the best agent in town.

237
00:18:45,234 --> 00:18:47,220
Yes, he and his partner Cooper.

238
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:50,420
And there is also a large team of foresters
that regulate movement.

239
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:52,153
Fantastic.

240
00:18:52,987 --> 00:18:55,684
But there are a few formalities,
not Buzz?

241
00:18:57,033 --> 00:18:58,729
If I remember correctly.

242
00:18:59,378 --> 00:19:05,171
Is there someone vertrappeld last year,
when my baseline could not reach.

243
00:19:05,642 --> 00:19:06,734
Tragic.

244
00:19:07,049 --> 00:19:09,230
But I have this year increased security.

245
00:19:09,913 --> 00:19:12,358
They took care of last year still
for security.

246
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:16,991
But you are here this year,
to a loop in it to sail.

247
00:19:23,015 --> 00:19:25,467
If supervisors, of course.

248
00:19:27,254 --> 00:19:28,773
And what she regards ...

249
00:19:29,536 --> 00:19:30,598
Which girl?

250
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:32,401
The girl who disappeared without trace.

251
00:19:40,745 --> 00:19:45,658
You know how many young people in a night
even "The Grateful Dead" singer have been followed?

252
00:19:45,659 --> 00:19:47,125
Jerry is dead.

253
00:19:47,678 --> 00:19:48,501
What?

254
00:19:48,502 --> 00:19:50,397
Jerry Garcia is dead.

255
00:19:50,398 --> 00:19:52,375
"The Grateful Dead" singer her anymore.

256
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:54,647
Perhaps it is her
any rocker here?

257
00:19:54,648 --> 00:19:58,157
Maybe she is "The Fish" went after.

258
00:19:58,203 --> 00:20:00,116
Yes, "The Fish" are also split.

259
00:20:00,117 --> 00:20:03,540
Hopefully, young people not only
come before him.

260
00:20:03,541 --> 00:20:05,790
You are here to save the furniture,
not Frank?

261
00:20:07,497 --> 00:20:09,417
Buzz, there is still work.

262
00:20:10,679 --> 00:20:12,006
How are you doing, Buzz.

263
00:20:12,031 --> 00:20:13,442
Not bad.

264
00:20:14,077 --> 00:20:15,401
I know t.

265
00:20:15,494 --> 00:20:19,494
And also that you are extra tough
the security of this festival

266
00:20:19,506 --> 00:20:20,821
Extra tough?

267
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:25,601
What you see there?
I won 't even tell you.

268
00:20:26,217 --> 00:20:28,168
I see jobs.

269
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:31,134
And that is what this timber town needs.

270
00:20:31,135 --> 00:20:32,959
Maybe not.

271
00:20:34,436 --> 00:20:35,658
Buzz.

272
00:20:36,293 --> 00:20:40,061
Can I be assured that everything
will do to this town to help.

273
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:42,585
You can be assured
I will exercise my job.

274
00:20:42,685 --> 00:20:45,378
As I always exercise my job.

275
00:20:46,506 --> 00:20:49,559
'S mustache' s requirement that the job is,
Buzz?

276
00:21:14,153 --> 00:21:18,729
Welcome to "t" Free Love Festival ", where the
best groups to come to America.

277
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:23,029
Freedom?
- Yes, the freedom to use drugs.

278
00:21:24,333 --> 00:21:25,769
Now we 're talking about it ...

279
00:21:25,838 --> 00:21:31,552
We have cocaine, speed, purple hydrobag ...

280
00:21:31,553 --> 00:21:35,003
And a few pills that Jay
my mother has stolen.

281
00:21:35,199 --> 00:21:37,597
And what have we here ...

282
00:21:37,906 --> 00:21:41,343
... even a half sheet of "smilies".
- Is that all?

283
00:21:41,344 --> 00:21:43,022
Is sometimes not enough?

284
00:21:43,453 --> 00:21:48,524
We are experienced drug swallower, Samantha.
- Yes, you should not try this at home.

285
00:21:49,202 --> 00:21:51,474
Sam, do not worry.
It is not just about drugs.

286
00:21:51,475 --> 00:21:53,445
"Free Love Festival" is a great concert ..

287
00:21:53,484 --> 00:21:55,310
... where peace loving people
meet ...

288
00:21:55,385 --> 00:21:57,566
... to the bad things
of the Government to discuss.

289
00:21:57,567 --> 00:21:59,829
It is fun.
- What are you talking about?

290
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:02,327
She is talking about Bush and the war in Iraq.

291
00:22:02,328 --> 00:22:04,260
And that Bush dicks of his generals afzuigd.

292
00:22:04,261 --> 00:22:08,045
Thanks for the explanation.
- Shut up, Bush is super.

293
00:22:08,568 --> 00:22:11,972
At least that guy has guts.

294
00:22:12,336 --> 00:22:14,494
He is the first president
who do not care about ...

295
00:22:14,557 --> 00:22:17,869
... what the world thinks about his decisions.
They will not stop him.

296
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:21,083
George Bush is the worst president
this country has ever had.

297
00:22:21,685 --> 00:22:24,353
You say that just because Bush hates blacks.

298
00:22:25,445 --> 00:22:27,261
Make that the cat would.

299
00:22:27,262 --> 00:22:29,064
What's that sound?

300
00:22:40,021 --> 00:22:41,346
What was that?

301
00:22:46,355 --> 00:22:48,359
There is a tree on the road.

302
00:22:48,389 --> 00:22:49,941
Do you get out!

303
00:22:50,544 --> 00:22:52,018
You are not welcome.

304
00:22:52,119 --> 00:22:55,969
This is the last time
I warn you hippies.

305
00:22:58,954 --> 00:23:02,948
Joey, stay here.
- That's the woodcutter in the newspaper.

306
00:23:03,327 --> 00:23:05,169
Everybody stay calm.

307
00:23:05,170 --> 00:23:06,643
Dylan Riggs, Jesus.

308
00:23:06,644 --> 00:23:09,707
I stay calm. Do not worry.
- Stay there, please.

309
00:23:09,714 --> 00:23:11,594
This maniac was trying to murder us.

310
00:23:11,595 --> 00:23:14,906
Dylan, what the hell is your problem?
You had these children may shatter.

311
00:23:14,907 --> 00:23:16,339
I have no problem.

312
00:23:16,765 --> 00:23:19,008
But the hippies ...

313
00:23:19,523 --> 00:23:22,344
It is the forest not, damn it!

314
00:23:22,345 --> 00:23:27,569
It is also not yours.
I can arrest you for this, fool.

315
00:23:27,570 --> 00:23:32,306
This tree is marked by the forester,
because he is infected by beetles.

316
00:23:32,307 --> 00:23:35,139
And I'm engaged to him to decide.

317
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:37,185
And that had to happen today, eh?

318
00:23:37,186 --> 00:23:40,755
Remove the tree here,
or should I arrest you?

319
00:23:43,712 --> 00:23:45,085
Is anyone hurt?

320
00:23:45,096 --> 00:23:48,596
Everything is fine, but go to him
just let go?

321
00:23:48,597 --> 00:23:50,552
What kind of a policy shall be exercised?

322
00:23:50,599 --> 00:23:52,346
I care for the safety, boy.

323
00:23:52,347 --> 00:23:54,670
I wouldn 't appreciate if you
would show more respect ...

324
00:23:54,719 --> 00:23:57,319
... for those who live here
and those who visit here.

325
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:59,283
Sir, do you want me a trouser suit for the show?

326
00:23:59,387 --> 00:24:02,679
My father has never done
and I urgently needed some discipline.

327
00:24:02,689 --> 00:24:03,879
Do you think this a joke?

328
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:06,666
Each year, four or five young people.

329
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:08,933
Youth against a tree to drive ...

330
00:24:08,934 --> 00:24:10,961
... or they paralyze themselves
by nitrous oxide gases ...

331
00:24:10,962 --> 00:24:13,391
... or they blow themselves during 't cook.

332
00:24:13,432 --> 00:24:15,512
If you feel invincible to be ...

333
00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:17,015
You are not.

334
00:24:18,410 --> 00:24:20,436
Sorry that I have your job more difficult ...

335
00:24:20,495 --> 00:24:24,595
... but can you tell me to
the nearest police car guide.

336
00:24:26,741 --> 00:24:30,762
We will see if you
can dance without legs.

337
00:24:32,271 --> 00:24:33,493
Why not leave you.

338
00:24:33,494 --> 00:24:37,022
Or should I even search your van?

339
00:24:37,599 --> 00:24:39,078
Would you like that?

340
00:24:44,185 --> 00:24:45,733
Local problem?

341
00:24:46,533 --> 00:24:50,639
Nothing for you to worry about it.
Prepare yourself but for Mr. Baker.

342
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,087
I will.

343
00:24:55,067 --> 00:24:57,264
Mayor.
- Call me Hal.

344
00:24:57,923 --> 00:25:00,680
This is a beautiful pin.
Can I also get one?

345
00:25:01,415 --> 00:25:03,139
That you deserve, Frank.

346
00:25:18,309 --> 00:25:20,208
It is a interesting weekend.

347
00:25:23,447 --> 00:25:25,667
That water felt good on.

348
00:25:26,673 --> 00:25:28,393
Water is wonderful.

349
00:25:29,125 --> 00:25:31,990
I go a couple picking mushrooms.
You coming?

350
00:25:32,225 --> 00:25:34,728
No, I go a little rest.

351
00:25:36,997 --> 00:25:38,198
I will not stay away long.

352
00:25:45,006 --> 00:25:46,544
Hello, mister rabbit.

353
00:25:47,415 --> 00:25:49,731
Come here, knulletje.
Mr. Rabbit.

354
00:25:49,733 --> 00:25:52,018
Come here.

355
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:53,867
What place is this?

356
00:25:54,619 --> 00:25:59,487
It was formerly a timber company.
Until such radical hippies' t opbliezen.

357
00:25:59,489 --> 00:26:00,974
When they are holding to it were built ...

358
00:26:00,975 --> 00:26:04,389
... there are 200 Chinese workers killed
when a gas bubble became.

359
00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:06,544
And they have them in a mass grave burial.

360
00:26:06,545 --> 00:26:07,943
On that spot.

361
00:26:15,541 --> 00:26:17,303
Mr. Rabbit.

362
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:21,702
Come here, Mr. Rabbit.

363
00:26:21,703 --> 00:26:23,563
I can not hurt.

364
00:26:24,873 --> 00:26:27,446
Who's there?
Is that you, Mr. Rabbit?

365
00:26:29,255 --> 00:26:31,104
Champignonnen.

366
00:26:35,723 --> 00:26:37,221
Look, Ivan!

367
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:41,931
It is that old guy, Oronomy.

368
00:26:43,176 --> 00:26:45,114
He has a pimped coat.

369
00:26:45,115 --> 00:26:46,302
Very nice.

370
00:26:46,303 --> 00:26:48,222
What is your means of transportation?

371
00:26:49,175 --> 00:26:50,975
It was not our intention
to harass you.

372
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:53,744
I have no objection.

373
00:26:54,262 --> 00:26:56,352
This is not my woods.

374
00:26:56,353 --> 00:26:58,164
Are you a hippie who is hardened ...

375
00:26:58,165 --> 00:27:01,070
... that the nature of all
and nobody 's possession?

376
00:27:01,152 --> 00:27:02,846
Yes, if you would 't able to.

377
00:27:03,161 --> 00:27:06,040
But I would be careful but in these forests.

378
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:08,272
You never know what you may encounter.

379
00:27:08,273 --> 00:27:09,925
You mean something like Bigfoot?

380
00:27:09,926 --> 00:27:12,066
No, he is not dangerous.

381
00:27:12,511 --> 00:27:16,823
They are traps that you should beware.

382
00:27:16,824 --> 00:27:18,503
I got it anyway you said.

383
00:27:19,595 --> 00:27:20,988
I have knowledge.

384
00:27:21,062 --> 00:27:25,171
It is true.
There are people here disappear.

385
00:27:26,884 --> 00:27:28,426
What do you mean? Why?

386
00:27:28,427 --> 00:27:30,256
It is because of the weed.

387
00:27:30,257 --> 00:27:33,999
The local residents find it not nice
if someone comes to their stock.

388
00:27:37,725 --> 00:27:39,335
Look at that!

389
00:27:41,124 --> 00:27:42,469
Hello!

390
00:27:43,033 --> 00:27:45,482
Come down.
We are amidst a orgy.

391
00:27:45,483 --> 00:27:48,358
Bring beer with us!
- Dude, that are assholes.

392
00:27:52,609 --> 00:27:54,749
Bastards!
- Take cover!

393
00:28:13,123 --> 00:28:15,424
Give it back, dog!

394
00:28:22,198 --> 00:28:23,151
What?

395
00:28:27,262 --> 00:28:31,247
I had said to you still from the forest to continue.

396
00:29:03,324 --> 00:29:06,989
Do not use all my coke, my friend.
- I was' t word.

397
00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:08,311
You are always' t word.

398
00:29:08,312 --> 00:29:11,727
I am glad that everyone along.

399
00:29:11,728 --> 00:29:15,668
This is strange trip started
but we are much fun.

400
00:29:16,936 --> 00:29:18,428
You know what I like to find?

401
00:29:18,429 --> 00:29:21,349
If someone cannabis plantation
to find where this guy talking about it.

402
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:26,049
It is these moments that 'make life beautiful.

403
00:29:26,050 --> 00:29:29,749
I am pleased that her coke is
I can not.

404
00:29:30,221 --> 00:29:32,913
There is also speed and other shit,
your appetite away.

405
00:29:32,914 --> 00:29:35,748
Yes, she is on a cocaine diet.
- Go fuck yourself.

406
00:29:36,821 --> 00:29:40,918
If I could, I would fuck me every day drowsy.
- That you would want.

407
00:29:41,864 --> 00:29:45,456
First, did you talk about, and now
do you want to cannabis fields go?

408
00:29:45,457 --> 00:29:49,611
No problem
like a paracommando I 'r through.

409
00:29:49,629 --> 00:29:52,318
All vehicles and slog through the ground.

410
00:29:53,088 --> 00:29:55,967
Everything for the cause.

411
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:58,837
You want some?
- No, thanks.

412
00:29:58,838 --> 00:30:01,876
It is good speed. You, Ivan?
- No, I have nothing.

413
00:30:02,548 --> 00:30:04,045
I am more.

414
00:30:04,279 --> 00:30:06,716
You've already had more than enough.
- You can never have enough.

415
00:30:06,717 --> 00:30:08,104
Stay away from me.

416
00:30:17,135 --> 00:30:21,799
If that is
I look up that cannabis plantation.

417
00:30:22,098 --> 00:30:24,049
Go for it, cowboy.

418
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:31,631
Are you tired? Sleepy?
- No.

419
00:30:32,556 --> 00:30:34,529
You may take a bit, if you wish.

420
00:30:36,776 --> 00:30:38,210
I just want you.

421
00:30:48,922 --> 00:30:51,230
I hope he is not drunk.

422
00:30:51,231 --> 00:30:54,203
If everyone is drunk,
can something bad happen.

423
00:30:54,204 --> 00:30:56,129
You have less worry, Sam.

424
00:30:57,153 --> 00:30:59,922
You're just scared,
because of your previous relationship with Jimmy.

425
00:31:03,506 --> 00:31:04,826
You do not have to be afraid.

426
00:31:06,168 --> 00:31:07,994
Be still not afraid kitty.

427
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:12,173
Anyway, it is pretty good.

428
00:31:13,526 --> 00:31:16,236
And I will behave.

429
00:31:16,237 --> 00:31:20,018
Only a little weed, and a few beers.

430
00:31:20,591 --> 00:31:21,920
Nothing more.

431
00:31:22,141 --> 00:31:24,380
Okay?
- Really?

432
00:31:25,531 --> 00:31:26,965
Yes, I promise 't.

433
00:31:29,505 --> 00:31:32,402
I got a surprise for you.
I am so back.

434
00:33:19,419 --> 00:33:20,494
Ivan.

435
00:33:57,986 --> 00:34:00,376
These are but grains.

436
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:06,306
Do you have someone in the rain to see it?

437
00:34:09,121 --> 00:34:11,332
Yes, it is full of crazy people here.

438
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:25,389
He said he immediately came back.
- How long has he lost?

439
00:34:25,390 --> 00:34:27,096
Since yesterday.
- Excuse me.

440
00:34:27,097 --> 00:34:28,067
Hold on.

441
00:34:28,184 --> 00:34:31,886
If after the presentation is still
missing, we will find him.

442
00:34:31,887 --> 00:34:34,573
My friend is in the forest lost
and he wants nothing to do.

443
00:34:34,574 --> 00:34:36,061
Easy.
He is probably ...

444
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:39,340
... somewhere intoxication 't sleep.

445
00:34:40,295 --> 00:34:42,510
You know what drugs might
he has taken?

446
00:34:42,511 --> 00:34:45,259
Go to Monday
- How they called me?

447
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:47,990
Why would you not help?
She says that he is lost.

448
00:34:47,991 --> 00:34:51,388
I don 't care. All she thinks
that Mickey Mouse a cat is real.

449
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:54,540
I am not in the forest looking to
a hippie flowers to pick is.

450
00:34:54,541 --> 00:34:58,905
He is probably one of those tents
another girl to fuck.

451
00:35:00,937 --> 00:35:02,098
What can I do for you?

452
00:35:03,265 --> 00:35:05,197
I think I will gestalkt.

453
00:35:08,444 --> 00:35:10,721
I am so back. I promise 't.

454
00:35:12,538 --> 00:35:16,441
Buzz?
- Yes, what is it?

455
00:35:16,503 --> 00:35:18,774
We have you on the north side
the river necessary.

456
00:35:20,497 --> 00:35:22,405
It is not pretty.

457
00:35:29,698 --> 00:35:31,960
Apparently, the beetles become involved.

458
00:35:32,041 --> 00:35:34,199
That must have been large beetles.

459
00:35:36,252 --> 00:35:38,811
I will be a report.

460
00:35:42,023 --> 00:35:44,560
It looks like an accident.
- Do you?

461
00:35:49,957 --> 00:35:52,362
This was not his intention, Cooper.

462
00:36:14,913 --> 00:36:16,616
Watch your step.

463
00:36:18,049 --> 00:36:19,335
Where is Joey?

464
00:36:21,256 --> 00:36:22,913
Follow me.

465
00:36:28,210 --> 00:36:29,372
Beer?

466
00:36:30,289 --> 00:36:31,533
Beer?

467
00:36:32,038 --> 00:36:34,551
Does anyone know where I can get beer?

468
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:38,376
Nitrous oxide?
- Nitrous oxide.

469
00:36:40,105 --> 00:36:41,546
Nitrous oxide.

470
00:37:02,716 --> 00:37:04,783
Watch your step girl.
- Sorry.

471
00:37:07,135 --> 00:37:08,401
Where are you going?

472
00:37:15,191 --> 00:37:17,110
We have some drugs needed.

473
00:37:34,887 --> 00:37:37,670
What on earth are you doing?

474
00:37:38,739 --> 00:37:40,773
Mayor.
How you doin '?

475
00:37:40,774 --> 00:37:43,253
You should not start flatter, Buzz.

476
00:37:43,254 --> 00:37:44,842
You just half of the forest closed.

477
00:37:44,843 --> 00:37:45,843
And why?

478
00:37:45,844 --> 00:37:49,955
Because some nudist
itself suspended?

479
00:37:49,956 --> 00:37:51,353
The body was maimed.

480
00:37:51,354 --> 00:37:53,541
It may be a mountain lion or a bear have been.

481
00:37:53,542 --> 00:37:56,526
Or perhaps was it Bigfoot?

482
00:37:58,174 --> 00:37:59,642
Now you gonna listen to me.

483
00:37:59,643 --> 00:38:03,063
There is a file of 3.2 km.

484
00:38:03,064 --> 00:38:05,283
And they want to the site 's festival.

485
00:38:05,284 --> 00:38:07,268
So here are your instructions.

486
00:38:07,269 --> 00:38:11,085
They let you go,
you take care of the security ...

487
00:38:11,086 --> 00:38:12,316
... and you go into it.

488
00:38:18,093 --> 00:38:20,066
You want me to remove the roadblock?

489
00:38:20,768 --> 00:38:24,218
Come on. Go to a man
diploma without listening?

490
00:38:25,016 --> 00:38:26,995
You still have no qualifications?

491
00:38:27,831 --> 00:38:29,665
Let the roadblock stand, Cooper.

492
00:38:30,055 --> 00:38:34,434
And please the forester,
to anyone willing to admit.

493
00:38:36,618 --> 00:38:37,669
Buzz.

494
00:38:38,348 --> 00:38:40,552
Do you think that t. ..

495
00:38:41,379 --> 00:38:43,291
Bigfoot ... would be?

496
00:38:44,070 --> 00:38:48,024
Yes, if Bigfoot black sweets hold.

497
00:39:03,874 --> 00:39:05,830
You look funny from up close.

498
00:39:06,313 --> 00:39:08,116
And not otherwise?

499
00:39:08,798 --> 00:39:10,470
You look always funny.

500
00:39:11,042 --> 00:39:12,500
It is weird.

501
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:26,728
I start 't feel.

502
00:39:27,716 --> 00:39:29,874
Samantha is crazy if she finds out.

503
00:39:29,875 --> 00:39:31,914
It 's soft, like XTC.

504
00:39:31,915 --> 00:39:34,910
She owns you.
- I don 't.

505
00:39:35,307 --> 00:39:37,348
It is not fun.

506
00:39:40,185 --> 00:39:41,780
They will find out.

507
00:39:41,981 --> 00:39:45,384
Do not worry, honey.
She loves you.

508
00:39:46,288 --> 00:39:47,410
Really?

509
00:39:48,733 --> 00:39:50,305
Does she love me?

510
00:40:00,604 --> 00:40:01,561
Joey?

511
00:40:06,852 --> 00:40:08,056
Sorry.

512
00:40:09,116 --> 00:40:11,286
Have you seen Joey somewhere?

513
00:40:11,287 --> 00:40:15,170
Here he is not,
and we will still be a while.

514
00:40:15,171 --> 00:40:16,695
You know the golden rule or not?

515
00:40:16,730 --> 00:40:20,054
'S shuttle back and forth,
then there gevreeën.

516
00:40:32,633 --> 00:40:34,045
Do I look high from?

517
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:36,480
Yes.

518
00:40:36,889 --> 00:40:38,253
How do you feel?

519
00:40:38,903 --> 00:40:41,655
I feel super.
- That 's all that counts.

520
00:40:43,192 --> 00:40:43,998
Linda.

521
00:40:44,370 --> 00:40:45,318
Samantha.

522
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:49,041
I know t.

523
00:40:51,306 --> 00:40:54,125
Linda, I can speak?
- Of course, sweetie.

524
00:41:05,122 --> 00:41:07,186
Amateur you are.

525
00:41:07,413 --> 00:41:08,746
See you.

526
00:41:10,891 --> 00:41:12,147
That is simply beautiful.

527
00:41:12,148 --> 00:41:15,028
I got a black car seen ...
- Jimmy is not here.

528
00:41:15,029 --> 00:41:18,744
Yes it is.
- No, he is not here.

529
00:41:18,745 --> 00:41:21,763
You gotta relax, right?

530
00:41:23,098 --> 00:41:24,877
Linda.

531
00:41:27,869 --> 00:41:30,228
Linda.

532
00:41:31,232 --> 00:41:33,538
Come here. Let me show you something.

533
00:41:33,539 --> 00:41:35,935
I wonder what that might be?

534
00:41:40,156 --> 00:41:41,531
Wait for me.

535
00:41:42,287 --> 00:41:44,776
We were not in the woods?

536
00:42:00,144 --> 00:42:03,168
Good afternoon, officer. What can I do for you?

537
00:42:04,265 --> 00:42:06,163
I would like to speak.

538
00:42:06,207 --> 00:42:08,507
There are a few problems,
I want to speak with you.

539
00:42:09,784 --> 00:42:13,260
Take me in your leg?
- No, sir.

540
00:42:13,461 --> 00:42:17,663
On the north side of the river
is a hippy in a graduated trap.

541
00:42:17,719 --> 00:42:20,719
And thus ended up
it upside down on a tree.

542
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:23,171
Do you know who this fall has sometimes put?

543
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:29,073
Got a search warrant, Buzz?
- No, but I can acquire one.

544
00:42:29,350 --> 00:42:32,759
I always wanted to know
where you are dealing.

545
00:42:47,734 --> 00:42:49,680
I do not think you understand it, Buzz.

546
00:42:51,823 --> 00:42:56,470
I hate hippies who do not, because they
here each year 's concert.

547
00:42:58,524 --> 00:43:01,494
I hate them because they have destroyed my life.

548
00:43:01,997 --> 00:43:07,561
Their debt people think that a tree
worth more than a lifetime.

549
00:43:08,578 --> 00:43:10,533
And my wife have been arrested ...

550
00:43:13,124 --> 00:43:15,163
... and my son.

551
00:43:15,164 --> 00:43:16,906
I don 't.

552
00:43:18,178 --> 00:43:22,177
But now I have that problem with that dead hippie.

553
00:43:23,115 --> 00:43:26,306
And I do not want more victims.
- I have killed nobody.

554
00:43:26,307 --> 00:43:27,791
That claim I do not.

555
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:33,254
But it is better if I lock you
to 't concert is over.

556
00:43:34,894 --> 00:43:36,682
It is for your own good.

557
00:43:37,075 --> 00:43:40,893
Whether you show me where the rest
of which are located?

558
00:43:42,619 --> 00:43:44,324
I will show you their location.

559
00:43:45,180 --> 00:43:49,404
But I think you still
protect the wrong people.

560
00:43:50,415 --> 00:43:54,492
The government has yet laws
which trade unions protect.

561
00:43:54,694 --> 00:43:56,357
And troublemakers.

562
00:43:57,447 --> 00:44:00,419
But they are always behind the little man.

563
00:44:02,621 --> 00:44:07,020
The government is always looking for the best solution
for the majority of the population.

564
00:44:08,002 --> 00:44:10,431
That depends on who leads the government.

565
00:44:10,865 --> 00:44:11,957
You know ...

566
00:44:12,261 --> 00:44:16,729
Ronny Reagan, may he rest in peace,
had a theory about candy.

567
00:44:18,226 --> 00:44:21,071
He had a big bowl of sweets
on his coffee table.

568
00:44:21,830 --> 00:44:26,603
He studied those who have names.
- Why?

569
00:44:26,604 --> 00:44:28,425
He said you two types of people
can distinguish.

570
00:44:28,426 --> 00:44:33,548
Those who seize every opportunity that arises,
without them there.

571
00:44:34,326 --> 00:44:44,770
And all those plans.
Those who see all tactical.

572
00:44:51,178 --> 00:44:53,798
Let Cooper site
of the other fall show, right?

573
00:44:54,521 --> 00:44:56,068
And stay here this weekend.

574
00:44:57,055 --> 00:45:00,377
It is for you to realize.
- Until later.

575
00:45:02,679 --> 00:45:03,970
Cooper.

576
00:45:05,645 --> 00:45:07,054
Are you there?

577
00:45:08,118 --> 00:45:09,157
Cooper.

578
00:45:17,424 --> 00:45:18,880
I'm here.

579
00:45:18,881 --> 00:45:24,216
I want you to fall Dylan collect.
And keep a eye in 't sail.

580
00:45:24,473 --> 00:45:26,909
He will not be the location
of all the traps out.

581
00:45:36,301 --> 00:45:37,966
I address you.

582
00:45:43,514 --> 00:45:44,797
I will address you again.

583
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:52,082
That I mean now.
- They were indeed delicious girls.

584
00:45:52,083 --> 00:45:56,195
You are all afraid of a big tit.
- As' t your mother.

585
00:45:56,558 --> 00:45:59,806
My mom has nice tits.
That you have to admit.

586
00:46:00,644 --> 00:46:01,936
Indeed.

587
00:46:03,634 --> 00:46:06,390
What do you think of a game:
"Bang the hippy thing".

588
00:46:14,828 --> 00:46:15,879
Linda.

589
00:46:17,491 --> 00:46:19,016
Linda.

590
00:46:20,351 --> 00:46:21,731
Where are you girl?

591
00:46:23,485 --> 00:46:25,543
Come here, kitty.

592
00:46:27,672 --> 00:46:28,901
Kitty.

593
00:46:29,977 --> 00:46:31,988
Come on, Linda.

594
00:46:33,802 --> 00:46:35,074
Joey?

595
00:46:36,582 --> 00:46:38,167
Joey, I'm here!

596
00:46:41,163 --> 00:46:42,196
Joey!

597
00:46:43,077 --> 00:46:44,565
Joey, I'm here!

598
00:46:46,100 --> 00:46:47,324
Joey!

599
00:46:48,554 --> 00:46:49,746
Joey?

600
00:46:50,346 --> 00:46:51,982
This is not fun anymore.

601
00:46:53,902 --> 00:46:55,021
Joey?

602
00:46:58,363 --> 00:46:59,490
Joey?

603
00:47:21,318 --> 00:47:23,334
We 've found cannabis field.

604
00:47:39,370 --> 00:47:42,960
You just have a weapon of mass destruction
found.

605
00:47:42,961 --> 00:47:45,936
Shut up.
- Keep you up but again.

606
00:47:53,452 --> 00:47:54,714
What is it?

607
00:47:58,020 --> 00:47:59,628
I'm bleeding, fucking.

608
00:48:07,261 --> 00:48:09,963
It is paint.
They are paintball guns' t shoot.

609
00:48:13,945 --> 00:48:18,934
Perhaps it is his dick 's suction.
- Let 's look.

610
00:48:26,201 --> 00:48:27,009
Damn.

611
00:48:28,793 --> 00:48:30,883
I paint my balls drop.

612
00:48:37,784 --> 00:48:41,234
Where the hell are they?
- Not here.

613
00:48:41,662 --> 00:48:43,195
Really 't, Sherlock.

614
00:48:43,959 --> 00:48:45,916
Someone like a game play.

615
00:48:48,783 --> 00:48:51,441
Play with the big, bad wolf.

616
00:48:51,442 --> 00:48:53,242
I got you, slut!

617
00:48:53,998 --> 00:48:55,852
Get that fool of me!

618
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:02,543
Come on, motherfucker!

619
00:49:09,203 --> 00:49:10,895
Do you like it?

620
00:49:46,901 --> 00:49:49,540
What the hell is your problem?

621
00:50:17,922 --> 00:50:19,761
Come to daddy, girl.

622
00:50:20,683 --> 00:50:23,663
I can not hurt.
I just want to talk.

623
00:50:34,478 --> 00:50:35,862
Help me!

624
00:51:58,264 --> 00:51:59,641
This is for Nancy.

625
00:52:00,881 --> 00:52:02,940
Today's youth ...

626
00:52:04,703 --> 00:52:06,871
... have nothing respect.

627
00:52:17,249 --> 00:52:19,226
Nancy!

628
00:52:36,522 --> 00:52:38,004
What are you doing?

629
00:52:39,274 --> 00:52:40,561
Get here.

630
00:52:42,230 --> 00:52:43,494
Drug addict.

631
00:52:44,247 --> 00:52:45,877
Faster, gatlekker.

632
00:52:48,909 --> 00:52:49,991
Busted.

633
00:52:51,597 --> 00:52:53,135
Give me one.

634
00:52:54,968 --> 00:52:56,757
I feel there is not much of.

635
00:52:58,316 --> 00:53:01,724
Perhaps the dose was too small?
- Stop whining.

636
00:53:01,725 --> 00:53:04,523
Take everything. It's good stuff.
And it is not quickly developed.

637
00:53:04,523 --> 00:53:07,905
You get a delicious feeling of.
- I do not know.

638
00:53:08,882 --> 00:53:10,470
Did we drink?

639
00:53:11,658 --> 00:53:12,419
No.

640
00:53:12,420 --> 00:53:14,654
Come on, man. Create a little fun.

641
00:53:14,703 --> 00:53:16,366
Swallow it now.

642
00:53:19,895 --> 00:53:20,832
Sam.

643
00:53:23,012 --> 00:53:24,241
I'm glad to see you.

644
00:53:26,629 --> 00:53:30,086
Where are Linda and Joey?
- I do not know.

645
00:53:30,685 --> 00:53:32,807
Maybe somewhere a party to it build?

646
00:53:50,532 --> 00:53:51,616
Come on.

647
00:53:54,067 --> 00:53:55,812
Starts it raining?

648
00:54:15,333 --> 00:54:18,809
I want everyone leaving this place.

649
00:54:18,810 --> 00:54:22,850
This access should remain accessible,
and I want you to that direction.

650
00:54:23,769 --> 00:54:25,241
Jesus Christ!

651
00:54:26,802 --> 00:54:30,017
I immediately needed body bags
on site.

652
00:54:30,346 --> 00:54:36,597
What are you waiting for, get admitted Friday
The party is over.

653
00:54:49,866 --> 00:54:53,227
I want you to reach the highway again makes.

654
00:54:53,803 --> 00:54:57,919
That is dangerous.
Please Extinguish that fire on your head.

655
00:54:59,777 --> 00:55:02,212
Sorry for the disruption.

656
00:55:02,213 --> 00:55:04,134
There is no light upon it wood.

657
00:55:05,354 --> 00:55:06,860
And keep your clothes on.

658
00:55:07,470 --> 00:55:10,066
What on earth are you doing?

659
00:55:10,067 --> 00:55:12,270
I close it off festival, Frank Baker.
- Rot op.

660
00:55:13,216 --> 00:55:16,067
I have two bodies found
here there is a killer around.

661
00:55:16,125 --> 00:55:19,304
Thanks for the party, but
I must now exercise my job.

662
00:55:19,305 --> 00:55:21,821
So grab your belongings and get the hell outta here.

663
00:55:25,777 --> 00:55:26,728
Very funny.

664
00:55:27,116 --> 00:55:28,703
Joy.

665
00:55:28,704 --> 00:55:30,104
It was nice to have you here.

666
00:55:31,472 --> 00:55:32,459
Come on, guys.

667
00:55:32,460 --> 00:55:34,509
Vogelman.

668
00:55:34,510 --> 00:55:35,653
Vogelman.

669
00:55:37,409 --> 00:55:38,836
The party is over.

670
00:55:38,837 --> 00:55:40,437
Take that costume off.

671
00:57:29,983 --> 00:57:33,980
Maybe you know it yet. But r
has tonight 's event played.

672
00:57:33,981 --> 00:57:37,261
And I have all ordered
to this country to leave.

673
00:57:37,262 --> 00:57:39,017
A few hours ago.

674
00:57:44,059 --> 00:57:49,492
If you do not want to leave, I
the power to call for reinforcements.

675
00:57:49,548 --> 00:57:53,924
To you with brute force away.
And there is also 's army at.

676
00:57:54,348 --> 00:57:56,443
You will be arrested.

677
00:57:57,144 --> 00:58:00,664
Go home. The party is over!

678
00:58:01,182 --> 00:58:02,599
Leave now!

679
00:58:03,125 --> 00:58:06,668
And do your clothes on.

680
00:58:07,196 --> 00:58:12,762
This is no joke. If you
not leave, you will die.

681
00:58:20,846 --> 00:58:25,169
The sheriff believes that a security problem
is. Let him but to send army.

682
00:58:25,170 --> 00:58:27,931
From me he may even call the Navy.

683
00:58:27,932 --> 00:58:32,069
Should I have her sometimes to remember that
we 's contract, Mayor.

684
00:58:32,070 --> 00:58:37,344
It is the basis of American civilization.
- That 's the problem, Mr. Baker.

685
00:58:37,345 --> 00:58:39,807
We have indeed a contract ...

686
00:58:41,762 --> 00:58:43,559
... look what it means ...

687
00:58:43,577 --> 00:58:46,565
... you have a presentation to ...

688
00:58:48,190 --> 00:58:53,237
... and the cost
you owe us ...

689
00:58:55,597 --> 00:58:57,436
... you will then have to pay.

690
00:58:59,131 --> 00:59:01,944
Excuse me?
- That was not against you.

691
00:59:08,471 --> 00:59:10,809
You look me busy.
Talk to you later, okay?

692
00:59:15,963 --> 00:59:17,587
Where do you go to?

693
00:59:19,206 --> 00:59:20,614
The party is over.

694
00:59:21,114 --> 00:59:22,803
The party is over.

695
00:59:24,192 --> 00:59:25,626
The party is not over.

696
00:59:25,711 --> 00:59:28,872
Unpack everything and make
you at that stage is.

697
00:59:28,873 --> 00:59:30,096
What?

698
00:59:30,097 --> 00:59:32,934
There are many people come
for a concert to see.

699
00:59:32,935 --> 00:59:35,869
And I do not disappoint, because
any agent that forbid us.

700
00:59:35,870 --> 00:59:39,039
And what do you want us to sing, Frank?
"Taps"?

701
00:59:39,554 --> 00:59:42,102
That I do not care ass.
All of you sing "Kumbaja.

702
00:59:42,103 --> 00:59:44,944
Make so that you are on stage.
We have a contract to come.

703
00:59:44,945 --> 00:59:47,634
By the grace of George Washington, do 't.

704
00:59:50,716 --> 00:59:51,939
Understood?

705
00:59:59,695 --> 01:00:02,246
They can not forbid us to sing.

706
01:00:05,638 --> 01:00:08,548
God, the American people
't given right to rock.

707
01:00:11,236 --> 01:00:14,247
Have you come to party?
- Yes!

708
01:00:17,671 --> 01:00:19,768
This is the forest.

709
01:00:21,585 --> 01:00:23,310
I love 'forest.

710
01:00:23,884 --> 01:00:25,918
It is the forest of God.

711
01:00:29,849 --> 01:00:31,762
Where is that damn cell phone.

712
01:00:35,834 --> 01:00:38,741
I have talked with Melody. Everything is fine.

713
01:00:38,742 --> 01:00:40,209
And what did he say?

714
01:00:40,633 --> 01:00:43,191
He said that it would take hours
to the highway to reach.

715
01:00:43,192 --> 01:00:46,742
And Joey, the keys,
and who knows where he is.

716
01:00:48,208 --> 01:00:50,865
Him you do not 't seen circus car?
- No, not Linda.

717
01:00:50,866 --> 01:00:52,177
We need them to look.

718
01:00:52,178 --> 01:00:55,824
Forget t.
Not until this killer is walking around.

719
01:00:56,447 --> 01:01:01,469
We can not just wait?
- Easy, baby, sooner or later he comes back.

720
01:01:01,570 --> 01:01:05,452
No, I'm not calm. We must do something.

721
01:01:05,453 --> 01:01:09,303
Why not try the XTC?
It is a must.

722
01:01:11,348 --> 01:01:14,295
Sam, stay here with me.

723
01:01:14,296 --> 01:01:16,804
I do not want to wait
and I would not be high.

724
01:01:16,805 --> 01:01:18,800
I would just get out.

725
01:01:18,801 --> 01:01:22,345
I can under any circumstance
be high. With pleasure.

726
01:01:24,800 --> 01:01:27,677
And the guy said it was not party.
Not officially.

727
01:01:27,678 --> 01:01:28,906
What are you talking about?

728
01:01:29,412 --> 01:01:32,412
Some guys like 'forest go
and a drum circle forms.

729
01:01:33,625 --> 01:01:36,957
We're still down here,
we can also further celebrations.

730
01:01:37,005 --> 01:01:38,684
Are you crazy?

731
01:01:46,955 --> 01:01:50,172
What is the problem of your girlfriend, dude?
- My problem?

732
01:01:50,709 --> 01:01:54,024
Got it sometimes noted,
that there are people dying.

733
01:01:55,025 --> 01:01:57,969
And where should we go, baby?
- Anywhere.

734
01:01:58,535 --> 01:02:02,398
Without Joey and Linda? Come here.

735
01:02:02,899 --> 01:02:06,390
Let's just stick together.
Everything is good.

736
01:02:07,256 --> 01:02:12,884
And we will Joey and Linda
's party somewhere else.

737
01:02:14,391 --> 01:02:15,411
What?

738
01:02:22,627 --> 01:02:24,456
You are also high.

739
01:02:25,523 --> 01:02:27,837
That is not true. I'm just ...

740
01:02:27,852 --> 01:02:29,062
I'm just ...

741
01:02:29,295 --> 01:02:31,907
Come on, baby. Where are you going?

742
01:02:33,450 --> 01:02:34,564
Sam?

743
01:02:35,908 --> 01:02:37,246
Come on, Sam.

744
01:03:27,521 --> 01:03:29,537
Ivan!

745
01:03:29,888 --> 01:03:31,443
The problem is ...

746
01:03:31,444 --> 01:03:34,669
... that people have no respect
for the authorities.

747
01:03:35,098 --> 01:03:36,832
I respect you, Buzz.

748
01:03:37,815 --> 01:03:39,722
You've misunderstood me.

749
01:03:50,307 --> 01:03:54,447
Old Riggs, the police have
always claimed that he was crazy.

750
01:03:54,728 --> 01:03:57,245
I had not thought
that he would murder people.

751
01:03:57,246 --> 01:03:59,571
He's a frightening bastard.

752
01:04:26,212 --> 01:04:27,330
Hold on.

753
01:04:31,582 --> 01:04:32,782
The coast is clear.

754
01:04:46,696 --> 01:04:49,315
Some people now
once sweets, my friend.

755
01:04:55,234 --> 01:04:57,510
Get him off me!
- You are in the way.

756
01:05:00,347 --> 01:05:02,344
I get him off me.

757
01:05:02,345 --> 01:05:03,645
Shoot him!

758
01:05:16,817 --> 01:05:19,148
Nice work.
- Sorry.

759
01:05:47,634 --> 01:05:49,057
Dylan Riggs!

760
01:05:50,197 --> 01:05:54,114
Turn the saw off,
and put your hands in the air.

761
01:05:54,569 --> 01:05:56,878
You are not my son from me decline.

762
01:05:58,547 --> 01:05:59,748
You are arrested.

763
01:06:08,746 --> 01:06:11,944
Is everything okay?
- Yes, go after him.

764
01:06:12,821 --> 01:06:14,077
Hang on!

765
01:06:19,706 --> 01:06:21,106
Ivan!

766
01:06:22,413 --> 01:06:24,669
Jack! Jade!

767
01:06:35,399 --> 01:06:37,319
Call "No".

768
01:06:37,320 --> 01:06:39,446
No!

769
01:06:41,808 --> 01:06:42,966
Sam.

770
01:06:42,967 --> 01:06:44,386
Ivan!

771
01:06:45,048 --> 01:06:47,309
Jack and Jade are ...

772
01:06:52,669 --> 01:06:57,261
What happened to your friend, Samantha?
He seems pretty high, right?

773
01:06:58,054 --> 01:07:02,439
Bastard!
- I thought hippies were peaceful?

774
01:07:03,879 --> 01:07:07,773
I'm not exactly welcome.
- How could you?

775
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:12,434
I love you, Sam!
- I hate you! You're sick!

776
01:07:12,856 --> 01:07:16,945
How can you say now?
- Let him go.

777
01:07:16,746 --> 01:07:20,066
I will let you go, slut?
- You can 't do not.

778
01:07:20,067 --> 01:07:21,898
You are going nowhere!

779
01:07:23,822 --> 01:07:26,569
What you see in this motherfucker?

780
01:07:26,570 --> 01:07:30,648
How do you prefer him over me?
- You are crazy.

781
01:07:30,649 --> 01:07:34,986
Why him you killed my friends?
You are a monster.

782
01:07:35,521 --> 01:07:36,774
What?

783
01:07:37,499 --> 01:07:40,736
What are you talking about?
I have not touched your friends.

784
01:07:40,737 --> 01:07:42,443
He has killed Jack and Jade.

785
01:07:44,245 --> 01:07:45,284
What?

786
01:07:45,894 --> 01:07:48,638
I have killed nobody.

787
01:07:49,274 --> 01:07:51,186
Why should I murder someone?

788
01:07:51,287 --> 01:07:53,238
Because you have a weapon!

789
01:07:57,610 --> 01:08:01,758
What should I say?
I am a big fan of Charlton Heston.

790
01:08:09,188 --> 01:08:10,888
I am a Republican.

791
01:08:12,676 --> 01:08:14,074
Sam, get the hell outta here are.

792
01:08:14,649 --> 01:08:16,133
Get outta here!

793
01:08:26,729 --> 01:08:28,549
Here we go again.

794
01:09:26,793 --> 01:09:27,708
Linda?

795
01:09:28,504 --> 01:09:29,525
Joey?

796
01:09:30,245 --> 01:09:31,794
Wil someone help me?

797
01:09:32,985 --> 01:09:35,793
Help!

798
01:09:49,251 --> 01:09:50,627
What was that?

799
01:09:52,724 --> 01:09:55,357
Something where you are on high.

800
01:11:20,353 --> 01:11:21,369
Ronny?

801
01:13:21,098 --> 01:13:24,714
Large improvement in occupied institutes
prepared itself for the release ...

802
01:13:24,715 --> 01:13:29,695
... of 1000 mentally handicapped patients.
Many of them had a violent past.

803
01:13:29,696 --> 01:13:33,703
By a lack of capital strength,
this is the only solution.

804
01:13:33,704 --> 01:13:39,815
Critics across the world condemned
Governor Reagan for this decision.

805
01:13:39,816 --> 01:13:43,179
Because these patients
showed the least positive evolution.

806
01:13:43,180 --> 01:13:48,603
The latter was impaired
released in January.

807
01:14:08,646 --> 01:14:09,740
Jesus!

808
01:14:10,593 --> 01:14:11,992
You are safe.

809
01:14:12,774 --> 01:14:14,900
You're safe, nobody will hurt you.

810
01:14:16,103 --> 01:14:17,504
You can not stop him.

811
01:14:19,007 --> 01:14:20,364
You can not stop him.

812
01:14:20,365 --> 01:14:22,939
It is Reagan.

813
01:14:23,691 --> 01:14:25,132
Nobody will hurt you.

814
01:14:25,536 --> 01:14:27,153
It is all okay.

815
01:14:28,502 --> 01:14:29,898
Everything is good.

816
01:14:31,756 --> 01:14:35,437
Buzz won 't get.
- Nobody will hurt you.

817
01:14:49,523 --> 01:14:52,541
It is time that these hippies some money.

818
01:14:52,889 --> 01:14:54,550
Or sometimes we work for nothing?

819
01:14:54,910 --> 01:14:57,363
Nobody works for nothing.

820
01:16:06,626 --> 01:16:09,597
Cooper, is everything okay?
- Yes, I'm okay.

821
01:16:09,598 --> 01:16:11,709
Did you get him arrested?
- He is dead.

822
01:16:11,710 --> 01:16:13,902
And he was not the perpetrator.

823
01:16:14,246 --> 01:16:15,845
I got a ambulance is needed.

824
01:16:16,254 --> 01:16:19,216
And contact the forester.
I wait for you at the campsite.

825
01:16:19,589 --> 01:16:21,354
This is a manhunt.

826
01:16:22,098 --> 01:16:24,374
Briggs And Gus is our prey.

827
01:16:24,521 --> 01:16:25,897
Let him.

828
01:16:27,566 --> 01:16:30,003
I thought they took him years ago
were imprisoned.

829
01:16:38,832 --> 01:16:42,452
Apparently he has Reagan
and thousands of other maniacs released.

830
01:16:42,453 --> 01:16:45,853
And we 're lucky that he has returned.

831
01:16:45,854 --> 01:16:47,717
What do you think his purpose is?

832
01:16:49,187 --> 01:16:50,491
Hippies.

833
01:17:34,716 --> 01:17:37,523
Brave dogs!

834
01:17:46,873 --> 01:17:49,444
Is everything all right, Buzz?

835
01:17:50,934 --> 01:17:53,645
Cooper,
I am near Matilda's farm.

836
01:17:54,835 --> 01:17:56,884
And everything is not fine.

837
01:18:14,539 --> 01:18:16,220
Linda?

838
01:18:19,339 --> 01:18:20,594
Linda.

839
01:18:25,029 --> 01:18:26,811
Everything will be fine, honey.

840
01:18:27,710 --> 01:18:31,574
I am so glad to see you. I missed you.

841
01:18:33,458 --> 01:18:35,785
Can you grab me?

842
01:19:05,082 --> 01:19:06,637
No pity.

843
01:19:08,529 --> 01:19:12,970
See what happened when you
deals with the wrong people?

844
01:19:18,946 --> 01:19:22,910
My daughters will never
become addicted to drugs.

845
01:19:26,832 --> 01:19:29,154
You want your mother's heart
do not break?

846
01:19:48,672 --> 01:19:51,825
Nancy? Dexter? Sit!

847
01:20:06,889 --> 01:20:12,093
The morning breaks in America.
As each day.

848
01:20:12,773 --> 01:20:15,298
Gus Briggs, don 't!

849
01:20:24,941 --> 01:20:27,813
You call this compassion and conservatism,
boy?

850
01:20:36,987 --> 01:20:38,530
Miss, is everything okay?

851
01:20:41,918 --> 01:20:44,540
Are you hurt?
- No.

852
01:20:44,620 --> 01:20:47,774
Cooper, still live?
- I'm still here.

853
01:20:47,775 --> 01:20:51,081
I'll have to treat, cooper.

854
01:20:51,209 --> 01:20:52,425
What did you say?

855
01:21:00,830 --> 01:21:02,637
I got it.
- No.

856
01:21:03,012 --> 01:21:05,318
Do not shoot!
- Do not shoot.

857
01:21:06,786 --> 01:21:11,035
These are creatures of God. They are our friends.

858
01:21:13,137 --> 01:21:14,487
Shoot.

859
01:21:17,151 --> 01:21:21,000
There is a wounded girl to me,
apparently under the influence of drugs.

860
01:21:21,495 --> 01:21:23,447
And a fatal victim.

861
01:21:23,448 --> 01:21:25,140
Leave me alone.

862
01:21:25,759 --> 01:21:27,738
Let my leg go, miss.

863
01:21:28,746 --> 01:21:30,368
You have been my release.

864
01:21:32,706 --> 01:21:33,796
Easy.

865
01:21:38,126 --> 01:21:40,095
Give me the gun. What are you doing?

866
01:23:41,905 --> 01:23:42,883
Jesus.

867
01:24:14,266 --> 01:24:15,811
View this mess out.

868
01:24:16,050 --> 01:24:18,306
Someone goes deep into his wallet
may affect.

869
01:24:18,358 --> 01:24:20,457
Jesus, what a stench.

870
01:24:21,968 --> 01:24:23,777
Goddamn.

871
01:24:27,208 --> 01:24:30,100
Nitrous oxide Boy, give me the balloon here.

872
01:24:30,101 --> 01:24:31,499
Get this outta here.

873
01:24:33,959 --> 01:24:35,554
Is everything okay?

874
01:24:37,066 --> 01:24:39,552
Have you ever 't "triple effect" heard
cooper?

875
01:24:39,907 --> 01:24:40,827
No.

876
01:24:40,828 --> 01:24:44,823
It's like a big crazy bastard is
and the whole world goes to the sharks.

877
01:24:44,918 --> 01:24:46,024
Hold on.

878
01:24:48,482 --> 01:24:49,712
Is everything okay?

879
01:24:49,982 --> 01:24:51,079
Yes.

880
01:24:52,450 --> 01:24:53,392
Well.

881
01:24:56,682 --> 01:24:57,829
What is it? 

882
01:24:58,410 --> 01:25:00,486
We went to the crime scene has been ... 

883
01:25:01,457 --> 01:25:03,567
... and we have Gus's body not found.
