1
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,561
Stop!

2
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,448
Stop! Or else I'll fire!

3
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,604
Stop!

4
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,647
Stop! Or else I'll fire!

5
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,365
Stop!

6
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,647
Shoot him! Don't let him get away.

7
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,961
He disappeared, sir.

8
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,288
That's impossible. He's got to be here.

9
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,845
Search the house again.

10
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,611
Apu..

11
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,284
You escaped?

12
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,567
Bullet is shot, right?

13
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,889
Will this end here?

14
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,363
Are we going to lose once again, Aparna?

15
00:03:55,720 --> 00:04:00,362
Apu, I can't lose you now.

16
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,491
Not after the
hardships of so many years.

17
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,050
Our world was different.

18
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,641
Till date, I'm
confused how we came together?

19
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:42,007
We're one. - Lie again.

20
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:49,447
Don't worry. We've white cards.

21
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,651
C'mon! You too.

22
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,848
You too are there? Get lost!

23
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,930
I came to buy in the market.

24
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,843
It's not 'swadeshi'
(local)! - Will you be 'swadeshi'?

25
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,249
British! - Quit India!

26
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,765
British! - Quit India!

27
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,365
Jatin da(brother)! - Long live!

28
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,204
Jatin da(brother)! - Long live!

29
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,964
Jatin da(brother)! - Long live!

30
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,804
Jatin da(brother)! - Long live!

31
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,008
British! - Quit India!

32
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,208
Jatin da(brother)! - Long live!

33
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,487
Jatin da(brother)! - Long live!

34
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:23,402
You taunted me so much
to go to district magistrate.

35
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,605
But the truth is
that I used to trust him..

36
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,090
...I used to trust every word of him.

37
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,289
Hello, Wilkinson here.

38
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:49,370
With a deep mind. You've to concentrate.

39
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,641
Tell Jhonson to stand down.

40
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,844
Yes, you heard me right?

41
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,651
And tell him to
return to police headquarter.

42
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,166
Immediately.

43
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,166
Sir, Wilkinson sir has ordered.

44
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,486
No action!

45
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,441
For you, he was a political leader..

46
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,007
...who had envisioned the future.

47
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,680
Guns down!

48
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,045
Company, about turn.

49
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,800
March!

50
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,685
Brother Jatin - Long live!

51
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:35,727
For me..

52
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,847
Brother Jatin - Long live!

53
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:39,491
For me, master was much more than this.

54
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,130
British! - Quit India!

55
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,601
He taught me to
raise question on everything.

56
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,082
Also on himself.

57
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:53,969
He isn't Johnson. He's a farmer.

58
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,691
I couldn't come.

59
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:00,206
I mean brother didn't allow me to come.

60
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,930
Did I ask you?

61
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,890
I had brought the
collection of detective stories for you.

62
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,530
Budkesh Bakshi! - Yes.

63
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,846
I've kept it inside.

64
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,925
Then the life will be better.

65
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,570
Then you can move about freely.

66
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,968
Go! They won't kill you. Go..

67
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,371
We should surround Johnson.

68
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,848
Never mind. We shall see
him next time. - Next time?

69
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:24,924
Are we going to get
freedom if we make few British quit?

70
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,406
Arrest him!

71
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,641
Ganesh Ghosh!

72
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,605
Ananta Singh!

73
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:53,286
Ambika Chakraborthy!

74
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,130
<i>Loknah Ba“!</i>

75
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,606
Nirmal Sen!

76
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,722
And Mr. Surya!

77
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:23,485
So, what's this interesting geography?

78
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:27,603
These are your words. What you said.

79
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,086
Why?

80
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,285
What's your plan?

81
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,208
I was hoping you won't tell you.

82
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:48,848
I'm giving you one last chance.

83
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,601
Quit!

84
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,690
Shall we try again?

85
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:08,687
What's you plan?

86
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,561
Jhonson!

87
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,203
All this must stop at once.

88
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,965
But I'm very close to results, sir.

89
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:32,570
Let them walk. - Walk.. Sir? - Yes.

90
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:37,167
No detain?! I want details.

91
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:38,686
Who they meet..

92
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:41,411
...where they go and what they do?

93
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:46,287
You're trained in
surveillance, I presume.

94
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:58,208
Akash, you didn't tell me..

95
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,520
"What happened in your school today.

96
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,250
Jhunku, come here.

97
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:04,690
Yes. - From where did you get this book?

98
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,045
Master had.. - You
know this book is banned.

99
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,649
Can you see what idiot literature.

100
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,449
...your son is reading these days?

101
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,445
Was the writer Idiot?

102
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,767
I mean this book contains
many tales of patriotism and..

103
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:24,605
Father, I don't
think he had.. - Don't argue.

104
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,251
I've not got a degree
of barrister for helping..

105
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,924
...you release from the jail.

106
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,451
I'm trying my best that some day..

107
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,966
...my son would fly off to England.

108
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:40,605
Wilkinson's doors
are open for you anytime.

109
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,884
Are you repaying him this way?

110
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,246
Aren't you ashamed?

111
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,001
Come fast!

112
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,891
He's such a rogue.

113
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,400
He followed me even when I
was attending the nature calls.

114
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,164
He kept on staring.

115
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,846
I said go on.

116
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,526
From the colour of my urine
you'll realise that I'm a freedom fighter.

117
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,206
What's the report, brother Nirmal?

118
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:25,411
What happened? No one agreed.

119
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,322
Did they not understand or
you didn't explain them well?

120
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,651
According to them this is impossible.

121
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,330
Neither here nor anywhere.

122
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:38,965
It's just a dream. - What do you mean?

123
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,485
Are these our dreams?

124
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,364
Who says it is a dream?

125
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,811
If we try, it can be true.

126
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,285
What are you saying?

127
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:56,406
Capturing Chittagong
alone? Without any outside help?

128
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,282
It's madness to
think about it. - Exactly.

129
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:02,247
This is the only reason we should do it.

130
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:05,571
Because no one will
believe that this is going to happen.

131
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,761
Everyone thinks
British are unconquerable.

132
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,770
They can't be defeated.

133
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,448
But something that
hasn't happened till date..

134
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,964
...why can't it happen now?

135
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:24,523
What if we will not succeed?

136
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:30,200
What if we succeed?

137
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,967
Britishers are not as bad as you think.

138
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:43,529
I don't understand
why I tolerate you so much.

139
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,529
You think Master's path is right?

140
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,250
Not at all.

141
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,329
Only you will lead
us to the right path"

142
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,004
...once you return form oxford.

143
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,771
Apu, it's very important to learn..

144
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,524
"British techniques to deal with them.

145
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,087
What?

146
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:02,721
Yes, British are
waiting to give us freedom.

147
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,925
Only you are lacking.

148
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:08,086
You go there. Come here.

149
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:10,721
C'mon!

150
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,764
Are we going to get
any help from Calcutta?

151
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,966
Go there.

152
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,091
We'll do something. Keep watching.

153
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,366
And weapons?

154
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:24,602
"Say something."

155
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,288
First of all on head..

156
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:32,411
I think something is
going on in Mastarda's mind.

157
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,360
Something big and unique.

158
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,284
Whatever it is. I
want to be a part of it.

159
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,642
You can't see a goat meeting death.

160
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,126
Will you kill British?

161
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:47,602
Goat is innocent. - C'mon.

162
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:53,165
"Let the seasons arrive stealthily."

163
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:58,201
Priti, brother Nirmal
is secretly staring at you.

164
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,602
You always think
like that about everyone.

165
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,650
C'mon.

166
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:07,328
"Let the seasons blossom!"

167
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,926
"Say something."

168
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:12,362
"Say something."

169
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,521
Come inside!

170
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,325
Come.. no one is inside.

171
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,810
I just came to see if you're alright.

172
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,609
See, I'm in a single piece.

173
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,248
Only that I'll never be
able to write with my right hand.

174
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:31,886
Sit down!

175
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,324
Please bandage this.

176
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,409
It's difficult doing it with one hand.

177
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:44,440
Masterda, don't you think
you'll be leading a happy life..

178
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:51,241
...had you not involved in all this mess?

179
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,202
That's why I always like you.

180
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:00,924
You always talk about unheard stories.

181
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,526
But, this isn't possible, Masterda.

182
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,122
Had you ever seen
an elephant in the zoo?

183
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,769
Yes, many a times. Why?

184
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,648
The chains tied in his legs are..

185
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,841
...much weaker than
the elephant's strength.

186
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,522
Still it fails to
break that chain. You know why?

187
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,681
Because, he habitual of remaining tied.

188
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,605
Yes, start!

189
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,011
C'mon, hurry up.

190
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,004
Pour some here.

191
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,561
There he comes. C'mon, let's go.

192
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:52,051
C'mon!

193
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:00,961
That's it!

194
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,765
Run! Run away!

195
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,568
So, how's your education coming along?

196
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:25,766
Good! I came first
in the class. - Really?

197
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:28,645
You know, I promised
your father every assistance"

198
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,171
...for you to go to England.

199
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:33,446
You'd like to study in
England, wouldn't you, Jhunku?

200
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,487
Yes, sir.

201
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:37,484
I want to be a lawyer
like my father. - Splendid.

202
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,607
By the way, I
wanted to talk to you about.

203
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,530
"What happened to Johnson?

204
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,806
Do you know who did it?

205
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,601
Look, I've made a
list of names of those boys..

206
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:58,127
...may be you know them.

207
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,924
Amar Nandi!

208
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,890
You tell me.

209
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,891
Sukhendu Ghosh!

210
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,842
Autumn was the dearest season for me.

211
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:24,447
The soft breeze would
soothe the heating atmosphere.

212
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:29,608
Hold it!

213
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,125
C'mon, hold it.

214
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:38,130
And I too would
come out to play football.

215
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,641
What's this?

216
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,968
C'mon, it's okay. Nothing has happened.

217
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:50,008
Till then the
incident happened with Johnson..

218
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,165
...had almost settled down.

219
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,044
Mr. Wilkinson said..

220
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,568
Look at Sen!

221
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:12,611
How are you?

222
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,129
Hey.. - What happened?

223
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:06,847
Sukhendu!

224
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,087
Sukhendu!

225
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,931
Sukhendu! - Sukhendu?!

226
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,126
Hey"

227
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,205
Either you tell us what to do?

228
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,043
Or want us to treat them in our ways?

229
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,169
He killed a boy!

230
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,006
It was an accident.

231
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:24,128
Unintended consequence so..

232
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,687
...there's always law enforcement.

233
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,247
I can't trust your ideals.

234
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:42,443
Tell me when to
take over the Chittagong?

235
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,761
You said it's impossible.

236
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,204
I can bring you more like this.

237
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,480
Who will use them?

238
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,965
All the expert users
are under watch or in jail.

239
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:05,809
Then use them, who don't know to use it.

240
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,126
Meaning?

241
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:10,928
Means.. white card holders.

242
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,321
Far away from the red card.

243
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,489
No, it's not possible.

244
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,561
There he comes..

245
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,523
"The only
responsible for Sukhendu's death.

246
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,321
Why did you tell them about Sukhendu?

247
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:37,045
Didn't you know what
they could do with him?

248
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,565
Traitor!

249
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:55,010
"Dreams are restless,
a new sky gives it a call."

250
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:59,531
"Wings inspires to fly away."

251
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:08,843
"Ocean waves settle in river."

252
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:13,250
"Water says open it."

253
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,570
"This is a battle."

254
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,286
I was confident that you'll be here.

255
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,925
Have you come here
to win my trust? - No.

256
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:32,169
I'm a traitor. -
Who said that? Not at all.

257
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:35,368
I loved brother Sukhendu!

258
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:37,885
I know.

259
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:42,840
And that Wilkinson.. used me.

260
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:49,530
I feel very bad. - I can understand.

261
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,125
No, you cannot.

262
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:56,771
No one could bend
in shame because of you.

263
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:08,686
I want to take revenge
of brother Sukhendu's death.

264
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,209
I won't spare Johnson.

265
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:16,286
I loved this scotch! - Really?

266
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:17,361
Yeah!

267
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,802
Cheers to you on Christmas evening!

268
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:20,802
Today evening.

269
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:23,803
The governor general in Calcutta.

270
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,724
...asked me to give this to you.

271
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:34,921
I can't.

272
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:40,171
But I requested Johnson's transfer.

273
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,401
Ladies and
gentlemen! May I raise a toast.

274
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:53,041
...In honour of our new
DIG of police. Here to go..

275
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:56,521
...Is to Mr. Charles Johnson.

276
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,202
Yes!

277
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,806
Jhunku is calling you downstairs.

278
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,529
Excuse me!

279
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,249
Yes, Jhunku, what's it?

280
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,487
Johnson is DIG?

281
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,411
Chief of police?!

282
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:32,364
He has been rewarded..

283
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,325
...for killing Sukhendu?

284
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:36,409
Jhunku, I think you better go home.

285
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:39,131
Is this your British
justice you boasted about?

286
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,491
You liar!

287
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,085
You hypocrite!

288
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,565
This belongs to my father.

289
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,571
I've stolen it. - Why?

290
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:52,682
I want to be with
you. - You're always with me.

291
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,166
Not like that.

292
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,367
But with your goal.

293
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:00,047
Do you even know what we want?

294
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:02,043
You want to drive
away the British, right?

295
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,170
This much is enough for me.

296
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:08,684
Look, you're tired.
We'll talk about it tomorrow.

297
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:12,244
No! Right now. Today itself.

298
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:15,526
If you didn't take me
along with you right away..

299
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,004
...I'll go on hunger strike right here.

300
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,410
Preparations were going on.

301
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:29,806
Everyone look at it carefully.

302
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:32,367
Close one eye and look
at the target with the other.

303
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,407
Fire!

304
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,926
Early morning, I'd leave the house.

305
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,401
I calmed down mother saying that.

306
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:43,041
...I've been selected in
a football team in my school.

307
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:45,128
Take the aim! - Just think"

308
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,489
Fire! - Football team and me?

309
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:53,602
No one is there.

310
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,480
You weren't seen
much in those days, Aparna.

311
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:07,087
Slowly.. slowly.. - Sit down everyone.

312
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,481
Sit down!

313
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:11,246
Sit down! sit down!

314
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:12,767
Slowly! Slowly!

315
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:14,647
Back straight!

316
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:17,610
Altogether. Breathe in!

317
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:20,007
Jhunku, back straight! Breathe out!

318
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,011
Breathe in!

319
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:25,645
Breathe out!

320
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:29,364
Hey, what are you doing here?

321
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,968
Yes, what are you doing at this time?

322
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:36,371
We were practicing for
the football match coming soon.

323
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,731
Little yoga,
meditation and concentration.

324
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:44,169
Will you do it? -
Quiet and make your guys quiet.

325
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:48,526
Everyone, show your card. - See!

326
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:51,051
All are white.

327
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,040
Are you satisfied?

328
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:04,804
Breathe in! Breathe out!

329
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:08,841
Breathe in! Bullet out!

330
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:13,326
Gun inside and bullet out.

331
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,689
And keep your back straight.

332
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,801
Let them go.

333
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:23,487
Listen carefully.

334
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:26,969
British are in strength at
only two places in Chittagong.

335
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:33,641
Police lines and
auxiliary forces armoury.

336
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,720
Disconnect these two
places and they'll shatter.

337
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:42,009
"Give me a place into fire torch."

338
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:46,404
"Give me a reason to
live. Life tells me this."

339
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:49,202
<i>"I'll</i> end my identity."

340
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,044
Two constables are standing at the gate.

341
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,850
Four on duty.

342
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:58,086
"Smoulders say."

343
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:00,561
"Keep moving."

344
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:05,001
"Shatter and turn to ashes."

345
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:07,890
You think all the British
come there for a cup of tea?

346
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,883
So, attack at the place
where all the officers sit..

347
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:10,961
...and have a cup of tea. - Right.

348
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,166
European club.

349
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,049
At once their commission will divide.

350
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,770
No, it's not so easy.

351
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,365
They'll get help
with just one phone call.

352
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,204
From where? From Calcutta of course.

353
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:21,248
Let's blast the
railway line. And it's over.

354
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:22,970
Also the telephone lines.

355
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:26,408
"There's only one desire."

356
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:30,087
"To get incorporated in this fire."

357
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:33,562
"And enjoy every bit of it."

358
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:48,009
20 boys. Totally inexperienced.

359
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:51,485
Good! By the way, what was your age..

360
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:53,210
...when you slapped the foreigner?

361
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:59,201
Hello!

362
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,408
Hello, ma'am! Yes, thank you.

363
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:03,005
Yes..

364
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:06,205
Come now.

365
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:08,442
Fight.

366
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,808
"You've to live with hopes."

367
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:16,331
"Every step echoes."

368
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:19,722
"A new light, new
life, in a new season.."

369
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:23,202
"..l should see a little dream."

370
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:26,648
"Life should be worth living."

371
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:30,282
"Shatter and turn to ashes." - C'mon!

372
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:33,484
"It should be myself, who'd meet death."

373
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:37,565
"With every breathe I take.

374
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:41,167
...I should see around."

375
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,890
"To the new world."

376
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,644
"I should fly."

377
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,370
"To the mission."

378
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:48,169
"..l should link with."

379
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:51,608
"There's only one desire."

380
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:55,321
"To get incorporated in this fire."

381
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:59,166
"And enjoy every bit of it."

382
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:20,883
Brother Jatin
refused to give the weapons.

383
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:28,123
How many guns do we have?

384
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:32,241
5 pistols! 7 rifles!

385
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:35,771
Total 12.

386
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,571
Fire!

387
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,441
Go back! - Bidu! Hari!

388
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,840
Fire!

389
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:50,884
What will happen later?

390
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:56,004
None of them has hit the target.

391
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:57,925
Ponder over it again.

392
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:01,040
Can't we postpone this? - Never.

393
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,966
If not now, we'll
never be able to do it.

394
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,001
Thank you.

395
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:20,682
Darling, what happened to
your idea of returning home?

396
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:25,002
We don't want to make you chicken there.

397
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,729
I quite like cooking.

398
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,725
Unless its for my brother.

399
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:35,365
1/3rd of glass go, is I've to work.

400
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,130
Is this the right place to hide?

401
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:54,483
I don't understand why
Masterda took you in this mission?

402
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:03,484
"Speak out the words unsaid."

403
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:09,289
"Life is dull, add some sweet dreams."

404
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:15,289
"These moments may not pass away."

405
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,930
"Speak up." - How are you?

406
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,241
Fine!

407
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:20,569
"Speak up." - I wanted to speak to you.

408
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,125
Tell me.

409
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:34,640
Priti, I wanted to tell you..
I mean I wanted to tell you that.

410
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,251
Tell me.

411
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:44,642
I wanted to love.. I mean loving you..

412
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:47,762
The commitment you show in fighting..

413
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:52,248
...I want it to be
an example to everyone.

414
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:54,890
And you should continue this spirit.

415
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,604
So, take me along.

416
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:59,485
How do you know I'm going somewhere?

417
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:02,211
Are you really going? - No..

418
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:07,690
I'm getting late. -
Nirmal! - See you later.

419
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:21,408
"Heart races and smiles."

420
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:28,763
"Eyes, anklets, dreams and bangles.."

421
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:32,890
"..everything seems to be in rhythm."

422
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:12,444
Fine, I'll eat later. - Listen, Jhunku.

423
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:26,287
Jhunku! What has happened to you, son?

424
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,563
You behave strange these days!

425
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:32,009
"Asks elbow and push the air."

426
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:34,765
"To open the bottle of fragrance."

427
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:37,889
"Melody song. The song spread.."

428
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:40,850
"sweeteners dissolved."

429
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:43,526
"Say something."

430
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,648
"Say something."

431
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:49,523
"Say something."

432
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:53,047
"Say something."

433
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:02,169
Remember one thing.

434
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:08,724
We're not rented guys
who came here for bloodshed.

435
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,088
Mother is looking for you.

436
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:17,644
We've no right to
treat their ladies in a way..

437
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:21,402
...they treated our ladies.

438
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:24,043
No innocents will be harmed.

439
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:27,845
May he be Indian or British.

440
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:31,083
Let's go.

441
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:15,525
Come out! - Goods will come
in 15 minutes. Will you do it?

442
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:23,047
Come in.

443
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,007
Break it!

444
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:35,081
Long live - The revolution!

445
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:36,889
Long live - The revolution!

446
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,684
Long live - The revolution!

447
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:42,606
Only handful of soldiers
was on duty to guard armoury.

448
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:44,762
Long live - The revolution!

449
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:48,162
British thought no
Indian can even enter..

450
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:50,846
...a mile away from their army.

451
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:57,768
Run away,
intruders! - Indians have come.

452
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:59,285
How did they come
here? They live in village.

453
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:01,601
C'mon, let's go. C'mon, let's run.

454
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:05,321
Indians have come.
C'mon, run! They've the weapons.

455
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:07,971
C'mon, leave from here.

456
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:10,725
Reach to the armoury room quick. C'mon!

457
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:14,847
Both of you escape.
And tell the magistrate..

458
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,571
...that rebellions have
taken over Chittagong now.

459
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:18,607
Yes.. -Yes, sir. - Go.

460
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:20,125
Sir, let us wear our uniform.

461
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:22,567
I'll take off what you're
wearing. Leave.. - Okay, sir.

462
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:24,085
Leave.. Leave..

463
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:27,481
We didn't need to fire a single bullet.

464
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:31,485
Out! All the intruders! Save yourself.

465
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:32,800
Good!

466
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:35,443
I was so nervous, that.

467
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:37,728
...I couldn't even
hold the rifle properly.

468
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:40,681
You bloody bastards! - Hands up!

469
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:51,844
Loknath and Nirmal
were assigned to bring..

470
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,684
...Machine guns from the armoury.

471
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:07,563
Yes.. stop!

472
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,920
I'm sorry to bother you at this time.

473
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,606
But AFI armoury has been taken over.

474
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:33,325
What are you talking?

475
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:37,041
Sir.. Terrorists!
- Where's your uniform?

476
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:39,090
Sir guns! They took over..

477
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:41,083
They were Surya Sen!
Ganesh Ghosh and Anant Singh.

478
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:45,003
I'll contact. - It's no
use, sir. The lines are cut.

479
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,406
Even the railway lines are cut.

480
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:47,811
No train can come in.

481
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:50,207
But I thought I told you..

482
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:51,964
...to have them
under constant surveillance.

483
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:54,407
We suspected them.. -
There's no point arguing over it now.

484
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:55,606
Have they come to
the British cantonment?

485
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:56,806
No, we're safe here.

486
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:59,042
Let's not fool ourselves any further.

487
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:02,402
We'll have to flee this town.

488
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:16,528
They've taken over Chittagong.

489
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:18,804
Masterda! Nirmal and boys!

490
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:22,685
Jhunku is also with them. - Jhunku?!

491
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:30,010
Don't you think it's too silent?

492
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:33,405
You stay here.

493
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:35,731
C'mon, Makkhan!

494
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:44,007
Foreign officers?! -
Tell me where are they?

495
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:49,006
It's good Friday
today! The club is closed.

496
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:51,162
What? - What?

497
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:54,160
I checked in every
room. There's nothing.

498
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,446
It has to be here.

499
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:00,610
We won't be able to
face them even for 2 days.

500
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:03,289
Forget about entering the city.

501
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:08,205
We've taken a look around the city.

502
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:09,645
British might not attack.

503
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,843
Have you ever seen a machine gun?

504
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:13,286
What happened?

505
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:16,041
Where are the weapons?

506
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:20,006
Machine gun isn't found.

507
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:24,560
We looked for each and every corner.

508
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:28,645
Must have kept somewhere else.

509
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:30,926
So, our entire planning has failed.

510
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:33,210
How do we face Chittagong?

511
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:36,326
Don't you worry..

512
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:39,006
...or fear.

513
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:52,600
What's just happened here is..

514
00:42:54,000 --> 00:43:00,884
...truly staggering and momentous.

515
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:08,767
The British rule has
been shaken to its foundation

516
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:13,526
No trained army achieved this.

517
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:17,007
Yes.. a handful of
teenagers was behind this.

518
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:21,524
You did it. Yes.

519
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:24,322
You all were a part of it.

520
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:29,491
History will remember this"

521
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:32,804
...glorious achievement and nothing else.

522
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:38,568
Indian republican army - Long live!

523
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:40,722
Long live - The revolution!

524
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:49,887
What you need is to
strike terror into the hearts of..

525
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:51,724
...every resident in Chittagong.

526
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:56,967
Thereafter, anyone who's even mentally..

527
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:58,929
"Sympathetic to the revolution.

528
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:01,048
Begging your pardon but we've to lose..

529
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:02,884
...every bit of credibility.

530
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:08,049
In India, one
rules firmly or not at all.

531
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:11,283
So, everybody, even
within our own administration"

532
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:13,681
...is upset with
the Bengal ordinance act.

533
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:15,728
Didn't you see, Wilkinson?

534
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:20,124
We need to stop
spreading this disease at any cost.

535
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:26,248
You're a fine and upright fellow.

536
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:30,684
We'd hate to lose you over this issue.

537
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:40,925
This has happened for
the first time in our country"

538
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:43,407
"that in spite of
police and military's presence..

539
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:47,321
...foreign officers are
confused where to hide with shame?

540
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:49,005
And who made this possible?

541
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:51,169
Few children like you.

542
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:53,169
Masterda has taken them under him.

543
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:54,606
Our Masterda.

544
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:56,409
Masterda Surya Sen!

545
00:44:56,680 --> 00:45:01,402
For one day Chittagong
was free of British officers.

546
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:03,810
Free of any ruling power.

547
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:07,851
But that one day
ended very soon, Aparna.

548
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:10,403
We didn't have the machine guns.

549
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:12,086
Our military commandants.

550
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:13,924
...Anant and Ganesh were missing.

551
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:16,923
We were helpless but to step off.

552
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,128
Stop! Now, we'll stay here.

553
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:23,046
Masterda had sent them
to check around the city.

554
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:26,444
Were they arrested?

555
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:34,084
When it was decided to
meet at the police line..

556
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:35,446
...where have they disappeared?

557
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:37,730
We came to take a look around the city.

558
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:38,881
We didn't come for fun.

559
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:40,366
I told you to hurry up.

560
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:42,044
Who told you to come along?

561
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:43,931
Masterda told me to go.

562
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:47,408
Will you share your knowledge here?

563
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:49,250
Save something till Calcutta.

564
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:58,484
British returned to Chittagong.

565
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:05,204
And this time they
had Ahsanulla with them.

566
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:08,205
A CID officer.

567
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:12,529
And now this city had to repay this act.

568
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:13,921
Where's Surya Sen?

569
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:17,323
For everything. - Where's Surya Sen?

570
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:20,326
Stand in a queue.

571
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:23,007
Listen to me carefully.

572
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:25,450
I want the names of everyone..

573
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:28,010
...Involved in armoury raid.

574
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:32,208
I said I want the names.

575
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:36,127
Hey, take them in the jeep. C'mon.

576
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:39,604
Hey, come down!

577
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:41,042
Come here.

578
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:45,168
Come here. Fast!

579
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:50,927
Coming from which village?

580
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,126
Dalghat!

581
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:54,889
We took the road from Dalghat.

582
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:56,606
We're dying of hunger.

583
00:46:56,680 --> 00:47:00,082
We didn't eat anything
from a week. - My wife died.

584
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:01,241
Show what's in your sack? Show me.

585
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:03,049
Some clothes, sir. - Show me.

586
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:04,281
It's blanket. - I'll get some medicines.

587
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:07,011
Listen sir, let us go.

588
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:08,127
There's nothing. See.

589
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:13,482
Hands up! Get out! Out!

590
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:16,291
Did you tie him tightly? - Yes.

591
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:18,840
Let's go.

592
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:21,846
What do we do?

593
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:23,251
Directly to Calcutta.

594
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:31,162
Every effort to look for
Anant and Ganesh were futile.

595
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:36,131
All the eatables were coming to an end.

596
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:42,006
For the first time I
saw Masterda getting scared.

597
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:49,844
I was scared seeing him.

598
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:52,410
And all of us too.

599
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,445
Salutations! Tell me.

600
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:24,124
Pack some biscuits. And
some vegetables too. - Okay.

601
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:32,244
Count this too.

602
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:35,731
We need food.

603
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:38,005
What's the price?

604
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:44,841
As if I don't know who you are.

605
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:51,131
Every newspaper printed the
news the attack on Chittagong.

606
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:55,324
If I charge my own people..

607
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:58,327
...I won't get a place even in the hell.

608
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:04,048
I pray for you everyday.

609
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:06,250
Today, I'll pray for some more.

610
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:11,326
Because, today you
people are in front of me.

611
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:22,607
May Allah give you success!

612
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:43,048
Goodbye! - Goodbye!

613
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:48,489
How long do we sit here?

614
00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:51,686
Let's attack directly.

615
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:53,564
We can't. It's not possible.

616
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:56,444
Masterda!

617
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:01,528
They've come to
known about our hideouts.

618
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:08,605
Good! - It's our time now. - Yes.

619
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:11,566
At least we won't be kept waiting.

620
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:14,527
This is where they were last seen.

621
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:17,082
They're gone. They can't escape.

622
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:20,565
Out strategy is
simple. We'll surround them.

623
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:24,447
If they fails,
we've already guns that way.

624
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:27,286
That's going to be
a guaranteed blood bath.

625
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:29,730
This is a war.

626
00:50:30,040 --> 00:50:33,647
You know. Most of those
rebels are under 18 years of age.

627
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:44,640
Are you scared?

628
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:49,169
Missing home.

629
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:56,887
Anyone who wants to go can go now.

630
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:05,804
You may have questions in mind.

631
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:07,965
I know.

632
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:11,691
That will be, how do we
face them in a war tomorrow?

633
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:16,161
Let me tell you that we will succeed.

634
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:18,489
And we'll give them a strong blow.

635
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:25,723
Because you've something
these intruders do not have.

636
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:29,321
And that is your self confidence.

637
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:33,127
And the courage to
fight for this confidence.

638
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:35,089
Never let this courage break.

639
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:36,889
And we'll win this war.

640
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:42,049
Are you courageous? - Yes.

641
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:46,009
Are you courageous? - Yes.

642
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:48,206
Do you have? - Yes.

643
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:51,610
Loudly! - Yes.

644
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:54,090
Louder! - Yes.

645
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:56,369
Louder! - Yes.

646
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:14,241
At that time I never thought I'll die.

647
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:18,647
I was sure I'm going to meet death.

648
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:23,207
And it was much better, Aparna.

649
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:27,087
"Than to live as a coward in your eyes.

650
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:49,521
I was really surprised when Masterda.

651
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:52,846
...gave charge to Loknath.

652
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:55,603
He was only 23 then.

653
00:52:57,160 --> 00:52:58,321
Friends..

654
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:00,731
It's the day..

655
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:02,850
...we were waiting for.

656
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:07,088
We'll prove to the British"

657
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:11,280
...that fifty of us are
more than their fifty thousands.

658
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:17,607
Can you all see that rock? - Yes.

659
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:19,763
Can you all see that rock? - Yes.

660
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:23,762
We won't let them cross this rock.

661
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:26,449
We'll drive them away from that point.

662
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:30,811
All of you alert..

663
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:32,611
And take your positions.

664
00:53:33,360 --> 00:53:34,566
Move!

665
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:40,045
Brother!

666
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:44,447
Are you scared?

667
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:48,446
Follow the orders.

668
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:55,241
Come!

669
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:07,729
Last night I was very disturbed.

670
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:14,928
And I had decided
to leave you. -I know.

671
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:21,204
I also know that
now you'll never leave me.

672
00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:28,922
Go!

673
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:34,768
Everyone! Fire!

674
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:38,087
Firing is taking
place from both the sides.

675
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:48,249
Sir, they're firing.

676
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:49,651
Jhunku, fire!

677
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:57,648
Move the charge now!

678
00:55:57,920 --> 00:55:59,843
Smith, start the machine gun fire.

679
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:01,888
I want them.

680
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:15,851
Get down, everyone.

681
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:17,365
Get down!

682
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:19,126
Masterda!

683
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:21,168
They're firing from
the other sides as well.

684
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:22,526
In that way, we'll get trapped.

685
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:24,927
Nirmal! Go to Masterda!

686
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:28,167
They're using machine gun.

687
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:29,925
Everyone bend down.

688
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,843
No.. no..

689
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:33,046
Come back.

690
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:38,322
Hey"

691
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:47,604
Bend down! Go down the rocks.

692
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:49,525
Firing a lot.

693
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:53,688
Vikram! - Vikram! Vikram!

694
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:06,764
Nirmal, take care of
the attackers on our back.

695
00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:09,208
Give me the gun! Give it.

696
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:11,362
Bent down and go.

697
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:13,807
Vikram! - They shouldn't come to know.

698
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:17,206
Bend down!

699
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:26,726
Bend down!

700
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:33,162
Can you see?

701
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:36,327
Can you see anything?

702
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:01,008
There he came.

703
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:05,845
Major Smith is gone sir.

704
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:07,410
Machine gun has gone sir.

705
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:13,291
Retreat!

706
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:20,001
Retreat!

707
00:58:35,320 --> 00:58:37,402
Yeah!

708
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:49,567
Listen!

709
00:59:52,600 --> 00:59:54,284
We're going.

710
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:05,762
You people quickly leave this place. Go!

711
01:00:26,840 --> 01:00:30,367
Indian Republican Army! Alert!

712
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:53,611
After four days
disruption, the train service between..

713
01:00:53,720 --> 01:00:56,849
"Calcutta and Chittagong
has been resumed from today.

714
01:00:57,440 --> 01:00:59,966
Even though peace and
order must be made in Chittagong.

715
01:01:00,040 --> 01:01:01,769
"Reports of serious..

716
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,606
We're sending all of you to your houses.

717
01:01:41,880 --> 01:01:44,406
Because they don't
know your names as yet.

718
01:01:44,520 --> 01:01:47,046
It's good for your
safety" - Listen to me.

719
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:49,771
Listen to me.

720
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:57,285
Masterda, what we want to do..

721
01:01:58,000 --> 01:01:59,809
...we want to do it in your company.

722
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:06,847
We won't go home. -
People are wanted even in the city.

723
01:02:08,720 --> 01:02:11,007
The war hasn't ended yet.

724
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:14,404
It'll continue.

725
01:02:15,240 --> 01:02:18,801
And it's not written
that freedom fighters.

726
01:02:19,040 --> 01:02:22,044
...will have to always
remain out of the house.

727
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:25,205
Go!

728
01:02:36,120 --> 01:02:39,124
We've a news that few
rebellions have come this side.

729
01:02:40,440 --> 01:02:43,683
In fact, they all
are professional criminals.

730
01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:46,602
Dacoits.

731
01:02:48,760 --> 01:02:52,207
And the biggest things
is that all of them are Hindu.

732
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:56,201
Don't worry. This is a Muslim village.

733
01:02:56,640 --> 01:03:00,201
They won't get shelter here. - Yes.

734
01:03:02,920 --> 01:03:05,207
I expected that from you, Rahim.

735
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:11,962
Goodbye! - Goodbye!

736
01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:29,761
Any message for me?
- Why should I tell you?

737
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:32,490
It's only for Masterda.

738
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:33,880
I hope no one has seen you.

739
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:36,521
You don't trust me? - I do..

740
01:03:36,600 --> 01:03:39,080
I do trust you. That's why
we selected you to go to Calcutta.

741
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:41,251
We?!

742
01:03:43,360 --> 01:03:47,251
You tell me.. do you trust me?

743
01:03:50,360 --> 01:03:51,850
Priti!

744
01:03:56,640 --> 01:03:58,290
This is a very risky job.

745
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:00,566
We can be arrested any time.

746
01:04:00,640 --> 01:04:04,247
And I don't want that
because of me.. - But you..

747
01:04:05,720 --> 01:04:07,165
You're with me, aren't you?

748
01:04:15,720 --> 01:04:17,722
You should learn to use this.

749
01:04:21,640 --> 01:04:23,005
I'll teach you.

750
01:04:40,200 --> 01:04:41,440
Jhunku?!

751
01:04:44,680 --> 01:04:46,523
MY son!

752
01:04:56,000 --> 01:05:01,723
Jhunku, look, I've made
fish curry of your choice.

753
01:05:01,960 --> 01:05:03,962
Eat.

754
01:05:06,320 --> 01:05:08,846
Yes, come in!

755
01:05:13,600 --> 01:05:14,806
Aunt!

756
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:16,086
Aunt, police!

757
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:28,242
Yes, Ahsanulla!

758
01:05:28,840 --> 01:05:32,731
What's the problem? -
Search the house. - Yes, sir.

759
01:05:34,360 --> 01:05:35,850
Where's your son?

760
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:38,370
Do you have the warrant?

761
01:05:39,640 --> 01:05:41,802
Warrant isn't needed now.

762
01:05:42,560 --> 01:05:47,805
You must know, Mrs. Roy,

763
01:05:49,520 --> 01:05:51,124
where's your son?

764
01:05:52,760 --> 01:05:54,205
He isn't in the house, sir.

765
01:05:56,880 --> 01:05:58,450
Will you play a game?

766
01:06:00,800 --> 01:06:03,485
Hey.. - Hey, leave him. Ahsanulla!

767
01:06:03,560 --> 01:06:05,324
I'll shoot him. -
Please, take the gun down.

768
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:06,731
Move back!

769
01:06:08,120 --> 01:06:12,205
Mrs. Roy, you'll have
to select one of your sons.

770
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:16,168
And I don't have much
time. I'll count only till three.

771
01:06:16,600 --> 01:06:18,728
1.. - Please, leave him.

772
01:06:19,040 --> 01:06:22,362
2.. - Ahsanulla please.. - Sir!

773
01:06:30,560 --> 01:06:32,961
Look.. look in this way..

774
01:06:33,320 --> 01:06:36,529
My son hasn't eaten
anything from past 2 days.

775
01:06:39,560 --> 01:06:42,643
Please, sir. At least grant him bail.

776
01:06:43,160 --> 01:06:46,050
I'm sorry, Roy. It's a serious of fence.

777
01:06:46,120 --> 01:06:49,681
He can't survive in
jail. He's too" too delicate.

778
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:51,330
Not that delicate
that he couldn't take..

779
01:06:51,400 --> 01:06:53,323
...our powers against the British empire.

780
01:06:57,960 --> 01:07:01,203
Look, Roy, you get him to talk.

781
01:07:02,320 --> 01:07:03,970
And I'll see what I can do.

782
01:07:05,960 --> 01:07:07,086
Goodnight!

783
01:07:22,920 --> 01:07:23,762
Jhunku!

784
01:07:25,800 --> 01:07:27,723
Papa, please take me out of this place.

785
01:07:28,080 --> 01:07:29,002
Please, papa.

786
01:07:29,080 --> 01:07:32,402
Yes, I'll take you out, son.

787
01:07:32,920 --> 01:07:36,163
But please.. tell them everything, son.

788
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:39,689
Magistrate Wilkinson has assured me..

789
01:07:41,560 --> 01:07:42,721
What?

790
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:45,763
You went to that man?

791
01:07:46,680 --> 01:07:48,648
Why don't you try to understand?

792
01:07:49,280 --> 01:07:51,362
Only he can help us, no body else!

793
01:07:51,440 --> 01:07:52,851
I don't need any help.

794
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:57,085
You've to think of
yourself. -Yes, I have.

795
01:07:59,520 --> 01:08:03,047
Tell mother not to worry about myself.

796
01:08:03,120 --> 01:08:04,281
Jhunku!

797
01:08:04,440 --> 01:08:06,204
Don't be so stubborn.

798
01:08:06,560 --> 01:08:08,324
I'm not being stubborn, papa.

799
01:08:10,120 --> 01:08:12,282
Neither you nor I can stop this now.

800
01:08:24,360 --> 01:08:25,771
Any news of Jhunku?

801
01:08:29,640 --> 01:08:30,801
No!

802
01:08:55,120 --> 01:08:56,326
Jhunku!

803
01:08:56,680 --> 01:09:00,241
Look at me. What has happened to you?

804
01:09:01,400 --> 01:09:03,209
Why they've given up?

805
01:09:04,720 --> 01:09:08,327
Do you know what mess you're in?

806
01:09:10,760 --> 01:09:12,683
We know who the leaders are.

807
01:09:13,320 --> 01:09:16,767
What we need you to
tell us is where they are.

808
01:09:17,360 --> 01:09:20,045
Where did you last see Surya Sen?

809
01:09:32,840 --> 01:09:36,287
Jhunku, I'm your best chance.

810
01:09:37,760 --> 01:09:39,171
Give me some hint.

811
01:09:40,040 --> 01:09:42,008
And I'll see to it that you're spared.

812
01:09:42,480 --> 01:09:43,481
Alright?

813
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:50,490
So, let's try again.

814
01:09:51,440 --> 01:09:54,603
What were your
instructions after you returned home?

815
01:09:56,760 --> 01:09:59,127
Speak out. Speak up!

816
01:09:59,240 --> 01:10:02,403
I know what Ahsanulla
and Johnson are capable of.

817
01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:05,051
I don't want to have
you hand you over to them.

818
01:10:15,440 --> 01:10:19,684
He can tell us
everything, sir. - Hope so.

819
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:24,967
Remember, he's only 14.

820
01:10:31,160 --> 01:10:35,927
Jhunku, no one wants to see you hurt.

821
01:10:36,920 --> 01:10:38,763
But I need to know..

822
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:41,970
...where's Mr. Sen?

823
01:10:44,360 --> 01:10:45,725
Jhunku!

824
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,207
Where's Surya Sen?

825
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:03,046
Tell me where he is.

826
01:11:10,760 --> 01:11:12,000
Rogue!

827
01:11:16,360 --> 01:11:19,330
Where's Surya Sen?

828
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:21,204
Where's he?

829
01:11:23,040 --> 01:11:25,725
Tell me..

830
01:11:26,480 --> 01:11:28,164
Rogue!

831
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:31,890
Stop!

832
01:11:43,160 --> 01:11:45,527
He didn't have him tortured, did you?

833
01:11:51,920 --> 01:11:55,129
Have you lost all sense of decency?

834
01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:14,969
Johnson! I want results!

835
01:13:15,360 --> 01:13:19,206
You've exactly one week to
find those bloody terrorists.

836
01:13:19,560 --> 01:13:23,201
I don't know how you do it.
I want to see them behind bars.

837
01:13:23,280 --> 01:13:24,520
Anand, police!

838
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:26,329
Run! Ganesh!

839
01:13:30,280 --> 01:13:31,645
Stop!

840
01:13:33,720 --> 01:13:35,848
Where's Surya Sen hiding?

841
01:13:37,120 --> 01:13:39,600
I asked where's Surya Sen?

842
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:50,564
Oh God!

843
01:14:01,080 --> 01:14:03,367
I'm very proud of you, my son.

844
01:14:51,160 --> 01:14:54,323
Look, they're fighting!
Look, he's beating him up.

845
01:14:54,640 --> 01:14:57,291
Help! Release him!

846
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:23,329
We were going to escape from the jail..

847
01:15:24,160 --> 01:15:25,400
...by digging a tunnel.

848
01:15:26,480 --> 01:15:29,051
And in this way, the second night began.

849
01:15:31,520 --> 01:15:34,251
I was feeling proud
that Masterda had selected me.

850
01:15:36,600 --> 01:15:38,807
For 30 days, we had dug the tunnel.

851
01:15:39,120 --> 01:15:40,963
Bombs were planted at their places.

852
01:15:41,040 --> 01:15:43,486
It's just that they
had to be interlinked.

853
01:16:05,200 --> 01:16:07,328
Children must be saved.

854
01:16:09,560 --> 01:16:12,848
I won't see them hanging to death.

855
01:16:12,920 --> 01:16:14,365
Then don't wait.

856
01:16:15,400 --> 01:16:18,483
This is the only way to
talk with British face to face.

857
01:16:19,680 --> 01:16:22,286
We should have
something with us to make them bend.

858
01:16:23,480 --> 01:16:25,801
They're killing our boys one by one.

859
01:16:25,960 --> 01:16:27,689
And we're being a silent spectacle.

860
01:16:28,440 --> 01:16:29,930
They should be shot to death.

861
01:16:30,680 --> 01:16:32,250
Ahsanulla and Johnson.

862
01:16:32,360 --> 01:16:36,160
After what they've
done, they've no right to live.

863
01:16:47,280 --> 01:16:48,327
Police!

864
01:16:48,680 --> 01:16:51,570
Masterda! Go away with
Priti, I'll tackle with them.

865
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:54,411
No! - You too come along.

866
01:16:54,800 --> 01:16:58,088
Masterda, you please go! - Fire!

867
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:05,331
Go! - You come along!

868
01:17:05,400 --> 01:17:06,606
You please go, Masterda!

869
01:17:06,680 --> 01:17:07,647
Nirmal!

870
01:17:07,760 --> 01:17:09,000
Nirmal! I said let's go.

871
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:15,126
Nirmal! - Nirmal!

872
01:17:16,600 --> 01:17:17,840
Nirmal!

873
01:17:26,840 --> 01:17:28,080
Masterda!

874
01:17:29,760 --> 01:17:31,762
This movement must not stop!

875
01:17:38,480 --> 01:17:39,561
Priti!

876
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:44,961
"Speak up.."

877
01:17:45,640 --> 01:17:49,850
"speak up.."

878
01:17:50,760 --> 01:17:52,125
Let's go, Priti!

879
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:54,365
Priti!

880
01:17:55,120 --> 01:17:57,600
Priti, let's go! Come!

881
01:17:57,680 --> 01:18:00,047
"Speak up.." - C'mon! - Nirmal! - C'mon!

882
01:18:02,440 --> 01:18:07,606
"Speak up.."

883
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:14,245
"Let seasons come out of the home."

884
01:18:14,640 --> 01:18:19,123
"Let the seasons that we sowed blossom."

885
01:18:19,200 --> 01:18:24,730
"Speak up everything unsaid."

886
01:18:24,880 --> 01:18:27,724
"Life is a little tasteless."

887
01:18:27,800 --> 01:18:30,724
"..dissolve a few
sugar-sweet dreams into it."

888
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:34,566
"See that these moments"

889
01:18:34,640 --> 01:18:36,529
...this time, doesn't pass."

890
01:18:36,600 --> 01:18:39,729
"speak up.."

891
01:18:39,800 --> 01:18:42,087
Everyone was shaken up
by brother Nirmal's death.

892
01:18:42,160 --> 01:18:44,288
"Speak up.."

893
01:18:44,720 --> 01:18:46,324
For the first time I saw..

894
01:18:46,440 --> 01:18:50,047
"Brothers Anant,
Ganesh and Loknath crying.

895
01:18:53,160 --> 01:18:55,891
Do we have to pay
this against our mission?

896
01:19:14,440 --> 01:19:16,920
If Nirmal been
here, he'd have done this.

897
01:19:18,920 --> 01:19:20,126
Be happy-

898
01:19:22,360 --> 01:19:24,362
Today the girls are with us.

899
01:19:28,600 --> 01:19:32,286
I had left a newly
wedded bride at home..

900
01:19:32,360 --> 01:19:35,204
...to jump to this battle.

901
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:41,289
She kept on begging, to come with me.

902
01:19:43,560 --> 01:19:46,723
But at that time,
wondered why but I was scared.

903
01:19:47,840 --> 01:19:49,604
Why don't you bring her now?

904
01:19:50,920 --> 01:19:52,206
It's not too late.

905
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:53,561
She's missing.

906
01:19:54,480 --> 01:19:57,529
Wonder where the people go away.

907
01:20:02,200 --> 01:20:04,726
There's no dearth
of brave boys in India.

908
01:20:06,560 --> 01:20:10,281
The land is drenched in their blood.

909
01:20:11,800 --> 01:20:15,521
But there'll be
something new in this air, today.

910
01:20:17,480 --> 01:20:19,642
The British empire will come to know..

911
01:20:20,680 --> 01:20:22,364
"That if need arise..

912
01:20:22,440 --> 01:20:24,602
...even Indian
daughters do not step back in..

913
01:20:25,080 --> 01:20:26,366
...sacrificing life.

914
01:21:05,840 --> 01:21:07,410
Ladies and gentlemen!

915
01:21:08,120 --> 01:21:11,886
There may be some among us who believe..

916
01:21:11,960 --> 01:21:14,486
"That our methods
have been less effective.

917
01:21:21,440 --> 01:21:24,808
The fact is, a great
deal of headway has been made..

918
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:26,689
"Against Mr. Surya Sen.

919
01:21:27,360 --> 01:21:30,967
Hey, what's happening?

920
01:21:49,080 --> 01:21:50,525
It's our mistake"

921
01:21:53,400 --> 01:21:55,050
Everyone bend down!

922
01:22:09,080 --> 01:22:11,651
Done! Let's go!

923
01:22:18,160 --> 01:22:23,929
"Pull the plaits of silences."

924
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:28,369
"Bring the liveliness of noise."

925
01:22:32,280 --> 01:22:37,889
"Break the glass of
silence on the floor."

926
01:22:38,080 --> 01:22:42,244
"And decorate the noise of love."

927
01:22:42,440 --> 01:22:45,205
"Today no should change into a call."

928
01:22:45,280 --> 01:22:47,965
"Today silence
should become a jingle sound."

929
01:22:48,040 --> 01:22:51,169
"Jingle words, spread rhymes."

930
01:22:51,240 --> 01:22:53,971
"Be with your heart, be there.."

931
01:22:54,040 --> 01:22:58,887
"Say something, say it out."

932
01:22:59,560 --> 01:23:05,761
"Say something, say it out."

933
01:23:24,200 --> 01:23:31,482
"Say something, say it out."

934
01:23:32,080 --> 01:23:39,771
But Jhunku, the sad news is
that sister Pritilata is no more.

935
01:23:47,200 --> 01:23:49,328
A girl came and shot.

936
01:23:49,800 --> 01:23:52,804
Johnson and Ahsanulla are killed.

937
01:23:53,200 --> 01:23:54,770
You haven't got a clue..

938
01:23:55,040 --> 01:23:56,451
...where Surya Sen is hiding!

939
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:58,525
It's failure.

940
01:23:59,320 --> 01:24:01,482
He can't hide so much longer, sir.

941
01:24:02,480 --> 01:24:05,529
You've been telling
me that from last 3 years.

942
01:24:07,760 --> 01:24:09,683
We have an offer from Surya Sen.

943
01:24:10,120 --> 01:24:14,205
He'd seize all attacks
against us provided you spare..

944
01:24:14,280 --> 01:24:15,691
"The lawyers' son and all his boys.

945
01:24:15,760 --> 01:24:19,082
I can't pull back now.
It'd be positively humiliating.

946
01:24:20,120 --> 01:24:22,361
I'd let you know as I proceed.

947
01:24:25,120 --> 01:24:27,691
None of us get death sentence.

948
01:24:28,760 --> 01:24:30,171
30 boys were released.

949
01:24:30,400 --> 01:24:32,846
Quit India!

950
01:24:33,640 --> 01:24:35,529
But with brothers
Anant, Ganesh and Loknath..

951
01:24:35,600 --> 01:24:40,242
...12 of us were sent to Andaman.

952
01:24:41,800 --> 01:24:43,245
'Kalapani!' (Life imprisonment).

953
01:24:44,040 --> 01:24:48,409
Far across the ocean. Forever.

954
01:24:48,720 --> 01:24:50,085
Quit India!

955
01:24:50,200 --> 01:24:51,247
Brother!

956
01:25:06,480 --> 01:25:09,290
So, was our rebel a bubble on the water?

957
01:25:12,440 --> 01:25:14,283
Does it made any difference to anyone?

958
01:25:17,360 --> 01:25:19,567
Was it a biggest mistake?

959
01:26:12,240 --> 01:26:15,687
Masterda's emotions
have affected every village.

960
01:26:16,120 --> 01:26:17,281
Do you know, Jhunku?

961
01:26:17,360 --> 01:26:20,887
Farmers have started
raising voice against British empire.

962
01:26:21,520 --> 01:26:24,842
Don't lose
courage, Jhunku! Yours Aparna!

963
01:26:31,480 --> 01:26:33,369
My time hasn't ended.

964
01:26:35,760 --> 01:26:39,685
I don't know what outcome
history has decided for me..

965
01:26:41,040 --> 01:26:42,565
...for dragging the innocent children..

966
01:26:42,640 --> 01:26:44,608
...In the fight for freedom.

967
01:26:49,520 --> 01:26:51,488
I don't even know if I could..

968
01:26:52,040 --> 01:26:56,682
...give them a new direction or not.

969
01:27:00,480 --> 01:27:03,165
The result of the movements
happened in Punjab and Bengal..

970
01:27:03,400 --> 01:27:05,926
...was that I was released after 7 years.

971
01:27:07,440 --> 01:27:08,487
' Kalapaani'.

972
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:14,088
A black history of
the golden days of my life.

973
01:27:16,640 --> 01:27:18,290
I was returning, Aparna..

974
01:27:19,240 --> 01:27:21,527
...may be with a
feeling if I have anything"

975
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:23,762
"left with me for Chittagong.

976
01:27:36,680 --> 01:27:40,287
"Restless are the
dreams, for whom new skies await."

977
01:27:40,360 --> 01:27:41,691
Jhunku!

978
01:27:42,600 --> 01:27:46,844
"Wings say.. fly away.."

979
01:27:50,320 --> 01:27:56,089
"Ocean waves settle in rivers."

980
01:27:56,360 --> 01:27:59,887
"Water says, open them.."

981
01:28:00,040 --> 01:28:01,485
Why didn't you get married?

982
01:28:03,600 --> 01:28:04,840
My Wish?

983
01:28:06,360 --> 01:28:10,763
"What smoke is this?"

984
01:28:11,400 --> 01:28:12,925
But where are we going?

985
01:28:14,360 --> 01:28:17,170
"There should be new music."

986
01:28:17,240 --> 01:28:21,962
"But I can't move
on, wonder what stops me."

987
01:28:22,640 --> 01:28:28,170
"This heart and mind say
differently. Where shall I go?"

988
01:28:28,320 --> 01:28:35,124
"My heart is restless!"

989
01:28:39,040 --> 01:28:40,451
Johnson had to go back.

990
01:29:05,800 --> 01:29:08,121
The war hasn't ended as yet.

991
01:29:08,920 --> 01:29:10,445
It'll continue!

992
01:29:18,560 --> 01:29:20,767
Masterda, police is here, run away.

993
01:29:23,720 --> 01:29:26,246
Surya Sen! You're under arrest!

994
01:29:30,720 --> 01:29:32,210
Organization!

995
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,446
"If this organization
breaks, everything will shatter."

996
01:29:37,160 --> 01:29:40,801
You've to nurture and
bring up this organization.

997
01:29:41,560 --> 01:29:45,087
As you nurture your crop.

998
01:29:46,640 --> 01:29:49,007
And when this crop will be ready.

999
01:29:49,920 --> 01:29:55,006
Believe me. You'll yield Gold.

1000
01:29:55,920 --> 01:29:59,447
You'll get silver from it.

1001
01:30:00,480 --> 01:30:01,481
Apu!

1002
01:30:05,280 --> 01:30:07,442
Will Masterda's sacrifice go in vain?

1003
01:30:09,640 --> 01:30:12,371
Was this struggle and battle useless?

1004
01:30:15,200 --> 01:30:20,081
It'll go useless if
you change your direction.

1005
01:30:23,040 --> 01:30:25,771
I'm left alone.

1006
01:30:26,600 --> 01:30:29,524
Come, Jhunku, I've to
show you a lot of things.

1007
01:30:29,920 --> 01:30:33,720
British and landlords
have captured the crops.

1008
01:30:34,040 --> 01:30:37,249
This is the godown
where the crops are stored.

1009
01:30:38,080 --> 01:30:40,208
But now the farmers will not step back.

1010
01:30:40,640 --> 01:30:42,290
20 villages are ready.

1011
01:30:43,560 --> 01:30:44,766
The time has come.

1012
01:30:45,200 --> 01:30:47,680
To get our crops back from the godown.

1013
01:30:54,640 --> 01:30:57,371
I was watching
hopes in your eyes, Aparna.

1014
01:30:59,600 --> 01:31:03,082
But may be I wasn't ready for it.

1015
01:31:14,480 --> 01:31:19,327
Hey, Stop! go back!

1016
01:31:22,360 --> 01:31:24,601
How will the
farmers leave their villages?

1017
01:31:26,920 --> 01:31:29,127
C'mon, Jhunku! C'mon!

1018
01:31:33,040 --> 01:31:35,122
Police will keep the
village under surveillance.

1019
01:31:35,200 --> 01:31:37,965
So what? They're
police. Let's fight them.

1020
01:31:38,520 --> 01:31:40,249
What do you mean?

1021
01:31:40,760 --> 01:31:43,843
If 5 to 6 are
gathered, they'll arrest us.

1022
01:31:44,680 --> 01:31:46,762
Forget about reaching the godown.

1023
01:31:52,560 --> 01:31:54,085
Tunnel!

1024
01:31:56,720 --> 01:31:57,926
Tunnel!

1025
01:31:58,000 --> 01:31:59,525
Tunnel?! - Tunnel?!

1026
01:31:59,600 --> 01:32:00,681
Meaning?

1027
01:32:02,120 --> 01:32:04,043
We'll dig tunnels from every village.

1028
01:32:04,320 --> 01:32:07,290
And we can reach
there through the tunnels.

1029
01:32:07,560 --> 01:32:09,289
No one will come to know about it.

1030
01:32:10,720 --> 01:32:12,131
This is possible.

1031
01:32:14,560 --> 01:32:16,005
Uncle, Masterda always said that.

1032
01:32:17,480 --> 01:32:19,847
...It's not impossible to
break any jail in this world.

1033
01:32:21,280 --> 01:32:22,725
We're many in numbers.

1034
01:32:23,360 --> 01:32:25,886
If we'd start working
altogether for 24 hours..

1035
01:32:26,600 --> 01:32:28,125
...and if we decide
that we want to do this"

1036
01:32:28,880 --> 01:32:30,211
"then it's possible in such less time"

1037
01:32:30,280 --> 01:32:32,044
"that no one will even realise.

1038
01:32:33,040 --> 01:32:35,361
And the British won't even get a hint.

1039
01:32:35,920 --> 01:32:37,251
Okay.

1040
01:32:38,760 --> 01:32:41,889
This is possible. -
It'll definitely happen.

1041
01:33:07,680 --> 01:33:09,728
All the arrangements are made.

1042
01:33:12,480 --> 01:33:14,881
Brother, police!

1043
01:33:19,480 --> 01:33:20,925
Run!

1044
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:24,331
Stop!

1045
01:33:24,840 --> 01:33:26,922
Stop or else, we'll fire!

1046
01:33:50,800 --> 01:33:51,767
Apu!

1047
01:33:52,560 --> 01:33:53,766
Apu!

1048
01:33:54,840 --> 01:33:56,604
Keep awakening. Don't sleep.

1049
01:33:57,720 --> 01:33:58,960
Keep your eyes open.

1050
01:33:59,160 --> 01:34:00,730
Stop worrying about me.

1051
01:34:03,440 --> 01:34:04,805
You go from here.

1052
01:34:06,040 --> 01:34:08,884
Thousands of people need you.

1053
01:34:10,440 --> 01:34:12,204
Go and look for them.

1054
01:34:16,240 --> 01:34:17,605
I'll come soon.

1055
01:34:24,800 --> 01:34:27,485
I had never distrusted you.

1056
01:34:30,360 --> 01:34:31,691
I'm coming.

1057
01:35:25,640 --> 01:35:26,880
Jhunku!

1058
01:35:28,360 --> 01:35:29,691
How are you?

1059
01:35:40,200 --> 01:35:41,850
We know what you're up to.

1060
01:35:43,360 --> 01:35:49,606
Today we'll reach the
godown through this very path.

1061
01:35:51,560 --> 01:35:53,608
I'm giving you one chance.

1062
01:35:54,560 --> 01:35:56,722
Turn and return.

1063
01:35:58,080 --> 01:36:01,482
And I'll pretend that you weren't here.

1064
01:36:03,520 --> 01:36:05,921
Only farmers have
the right on this crop.

1065
01:36:07,320 --> 01:36:09,527
I want to help you.

1066
01:36:10,840 --> 01:36:14,083
You did it once. Help!

1067
01:36:17,240 --> 01:36:18,969
You're under arrest.

1068
01:36:23,360 --> 01:36:24,566
Listen!

1069
01:36:28,560 --> 01:36:29,846
Carefully!

1070
01:36:55,760 --> 01:37:03,167
"A new door has opened
up, it's a call of 'lshan'!"

1071
01:37:07,600 --> 01:37:14,961
"Everyone's courageous."

1072
01:37:15,440 --> 01:37:17,408
"lshan!"

1073
01:37:17,480 --> 01:37:18,891
Let's go!

1074
01:37:19,040 --> 01:37:24,040
"Is the direction
that has light and songs."

1075
01:37:31,320 --> 01:37:34,927
"lshan!"

1076
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:43,124
"ls the morning, that takes
you to your goal, it's a hope."

1077
01:37:43,200 --> 01:37:46,170
"It's victory."

1078
01:37:50,080 --> 01:37:53,004
Revolution! - Long live!

1079
01:38:03,600 --> 01:38:07,571
"Even by fighting big dreams,
he'd won in every step of life."

1080
01:38:07,640 --> 01:38:11,690
"It's a feeling of
relief. The melody is new."
