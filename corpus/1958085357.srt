1
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:09,720
[tense music]

2
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,320
I killed my grandmother.

3
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,000
I took her to a cemetery.

4
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:18,000
I took her to the cemetery where I wanted
to lay her to rest, but before I buried

5
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:23,840
her six feet under, I cut her into pieces.

6
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:30,840
Some of the organs I brought to the
session this evening, this was a brain.

7
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,800
Oh, gross.

8
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,520
It's disgusting.

9
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:37,440
No, thank you.

10
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,240
I'm kosher.

11
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:44,400
Hey, Kristine, why don't you take this
and replace it for the one in your head.

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
[music continues]

13
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:57,120
You know, oh, obviously I can, uh, tell by
the size of the, the right lobe that your

14
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,120
grandmother was a very educated person.

15
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,280
Silence.

16
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,520
Next comes my granny's hand.

17
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,280
Jason,

18
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,960
is this the same hand that your
grandmother used to pleasure herself?

19
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,280
That's really sick, Pete.

20
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,400
Shhhhh.

21
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:29,560
No, I'm going to pass around the bowels.

22
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,840
This is pretty heavy guys.

23
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,560
I think it's full of shit.

24
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,200
Hmm.
Take.

25
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,120
No, I'm gonna vomit.

26
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:40,520
Mom.

27
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,840
I had an accident.

28
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,280
Now comes the moment.

29
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,720
You will never forget.

30
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,840
I had some problems
extracting this one, but.

31
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:55,720
What?

32
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:56,840
Here it is.

33
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:57,720
Mm.

34
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,000
The heart.

35
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,160
Oh god.

36
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,160
Ugh.
I can't take this anymore.

37
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,760
All right.

38
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:11,600
All right, let's cut this out.

39
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:16,720
How about we do something
fun instead of this ghoulish mess?

40
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,000
Hey Jason, where'd
you really get this shit?

41
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,240
They're pig guts.

42
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,600
I totally had you guys going.

43
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,360
Well, you really thought they
were my grandma's organs.

44
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:31,320
Oh, right, Jason, right.
- Pig.

45
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,920
You have nothing better to do
with your time than buy pig guts

46
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:34,840
thanks Jason.

47
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,360
Like you almost kill your grandmother.

48
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:41,360
You were looking kind of
logginly at those organs.

49
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,800
Stop.

50
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,280
You save some towels.

51
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,160
No, no, we don't do this every weekend.

52
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,480
Who want’s some beer?

53
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,160
No, how about some coke.

54
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,240
Lay off the drugs, man.

55
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,240
Oh, look at that.

56
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,720
Those are so cool.

57
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:02,560
I know.

58
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,520
Where'd you get them?

59
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,720
I got 'em at that new
place called, is that shoes.

60
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,480
I’m gonna tell you something.

61
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,480
It's important.

62
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:12,800
Oh yeah.
- Yeah.

63
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:13,520
Oh my god.

64
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,720
Oh, this guy at the company workout.

65
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,040
He is so hot.

66
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,560
He would believe the body on this guy.

67
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,000
I talked to him.

68
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:23,920
He's so sweet.

69
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:27,720
I swear it's different than all the
other players I've dated, I swear to you.

70
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,600
And, uh, I gave him my number.
Okay.

71
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,360
And we're probably gonna go out soon.

72
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,280
Good.

73
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:34,680
I hope it works out.

74
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,480
I will ready do.

75
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,240
I'm so sick of the play.

76
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,000
It's over.
- Okay.

77
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,560
It's over with that I swear.

78
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,160
Did you dye your hair?

79
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,080
You did? Tell me.

80
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,360
I was waiting for you to tell me.
Yeah.

81
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:54,720
I got bored at the same
old thing every single day.

82
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,160
Oh, it's cute.

83
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,880
Yeah, but listen about this guy.

84
00:05:59,000 --> 00:05:59,680
Mm-hmm.

85
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,400
Be careful.

86
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,040
You know how men are.

87
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,120
Please.

88
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,280
They don't have it.

89
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:06,840
They want it.

90
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:10,160
And when they have it, they throw it away.

91
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,400
I know.

92
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:12,760
Yep.

93
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,320
Guess what?

94
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:18,160
I talked to my boss and it looks like I'm
gonna start working at the salon again.

95
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,400
That's cool.

96
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,080
Mm-hmm.

97
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,280
So, how's Tomi?

98
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,200
Oh.

99
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,080
Tom.

100
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,600
I got in a fight with my dad the
other day, and he's so mad at me.

101
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,000
I slept over at Tom's house for two nights.

102
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,720
Two nights? What'd you
do over there for two nights?

103
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:40,960
Oh, you know, a little bit of
romance and a little bit of sex.

104
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,040
That's what I thought.

105
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,280
I'm so in love with him.

106
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,480
I just have to lose some weight.

107
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,680
10 pounds and I will be so happy.

108
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:53,640
I've been killed for that
ass. I'd killed for those boobs.

109
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,480
Well, god bless me.

110
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:59,480
Ah, Christine Tomaso from
Gurnee, Illinois lost 10 pounds.

111
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:00,840
Come on now.

112
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,800
Get down the pounds.

113
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:03,920
You guys are idiots.

114
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:04,840
No,

115
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,760
[ominous music]

116
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,000
Here's a toast

117
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:22,280
to our ambitious future that finally
we all finish college and hopefully we're

118
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,800
gonna have a sexual partner, right?

119
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,280
I have one right here.

120
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:26,800
Merry Christmas.

121
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,400
And finally, my mom.

122
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,800
Stop stalking me.

123
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,520
Thank you very much.

124
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,400
Cheers.
- Cheers.

125
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,280
Cheers.

126
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,400
Hey Michelle.
Drink up, man.

127
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,760
We're all praying to the porcelain.

128
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:51,000
God, by the time the night's
over, leave her alone Pete.

129
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,120
If she doesn't wanna drink,
she doesn't wanna drink.

130
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:53,920
Big deal.

131
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:59,880
See, women are aware of when
they should drink or not, and you boys

132
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,600
obviously don't understand that.

133
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:08,720
Natalie, I know you're a serious
feminist, but leave men alone.

134
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,240
A man discovered America.

135
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,840
Caesar was a man.

136
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,360
The pope is a man.

137
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,800
Jesus Christ was a man.

138
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:23,520
The president of the United States is
not a woman either, and, and do you know

139
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,240
who discovered the light bulb?

140
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,120
A man

141
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,600
men are the leading forces
of life, family, and uh, golf.

142
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:33,640
Yeah.

143
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:34,480
Wilson.

144
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:35,840
Woo.
- Alright.

145
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:37,560
Yeah.

146
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:38,560
Vic.

147
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:39,720
Yeah, baby.

148
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,200
Yeah.

149
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,160
You know Vic, you're a really
nice boy, but if there weren't women,

150
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,880
then you wouldn't exist and you
wouldn't be able to bless us with

151
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,720
your ever so stimulating comments.

152
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,480
Stop arguing.

153
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,520
We're wasting time.

154
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,240
If I wanted to argue, I would've
stayed at home with my younger brother.

155
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,600
Oh, we're not arguing

156
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,320
an argument would consist
of two intelligent people.

157
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:12,600
Yeah, let's talk about something
intelligent and a little provocative.

158
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:13,800
Okay.

159
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,960
Uh, you mean, uh, sex?

160
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,320
Oh, that sounds great.

161
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:21,840
When was the last time you guys
had a really good sexual experience?

162
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:24,840
I mean, sweating and going nuts?

163
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,640
Uh, I think it was five minutes ago.

164
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,600
Shut up.
I want the truth from all of you.

165
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:30,800
Okay.
- Okay.

166
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:31,720
We'll start with you.

167
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:35,000
No, I don't feel like sharing
my personal life with anyone.

168
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,360
Not much to share.

169
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,200
Shut up.

170
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,720
Why don't you try and
be a gentleman for once?

171
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:42,440
All right.

172
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:43,960
What?

173
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,080
Cut the shit, guys.

174
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:46,840
Yeah.

175
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,600
Let's talk.

176
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:55,000
Ladies and gentlemen, let's not
forget why we are here tonight.

177
00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:00,000
We are here to induct Michelle
into our group, our special group

178
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,080
of unique and ingenious clowns.

179
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:07,520
Who come together and think of new
ways not to be a bunch of losers in life.

180
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,200
Right?

181
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:09,960
Michelle?

182
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,720
I hope you like it here in Chicago.

183
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:19,720
We guarantee fun, fellowship, excitement,
happiness, basically everything.

184
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,520
And little bit of suspense.

185
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:26,760
Thank you. Um, I just
wanted to tell you guys.

186
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,960
After I got here from Seattle, I had
a really hard time, uh, missing my

187
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:35,840
old friends and all, but, uh, I'm
really happy that I met you guys.

188
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:40,200
Um, you're all a little
off, but a lot of fun.

189
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:45,120
Um, spent the last 20 years there
and hope to spend the next 20 here.

190
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,520
So don't make me cry my eyes out.

191
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,520
You're gonna love it in Chicago.

192
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,600
You will, you know, Michelle,
can I call you Michelle?

193
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:02,120
Life is like a rich meringue and,
and I'm diabetic, so I can't enjoy

194
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,600
it, but, that said, pipe down.

195
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:09,520
Um, you know, a lot of people
come in and out of your life as you

196
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,000
get older, but it's the ones that
stick around who really matter.

197
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,160
So, you know, that's what we
found here today and we're just

198
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,360
glad that you could join us.

199
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,000
But that said, never trust anyone.

200
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,120
Careful.

201
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:26,240
Wine enhances your sexual desires, you.

202
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:34,320
Someone's getting a
little too excited, I swear.

203
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,040
Natalie, I think you're the horniest girl.

204
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,360
I know.
All you do is talk about sex.

205
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:41,760
So who doesn't like sex?

206
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:45,760
It's the most amazing
feeling in the world, right?

207
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,240
Do you know what it's
like to make love to a man?

208
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,160
You're in love with.

209
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:56,160
See, I don't really wanna know that
because personally I love women.

210
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:56,840
Shut up.

211
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:58,960
Women.

212
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,320
Uh, no.

213
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,400
No women.

214
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,320
I like you baby.

215
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,200
Hmm.

216
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:08,000
Well, if you wanna know my opinion,
guys are the ones who harass women.

217
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,200
Women don't want sex, they won't romance.

218
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:12,440
Yeah.

219
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,120
Right.

220
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,640
What about that time when you went shut up.

221
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:18,600
I can’t stand you.

222
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:25,120
I wonder why women confuse the emotions
of men by acting as if they don't want it.

223
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:29,440
But in reality, they want
it just as bad as men.

224
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,000
In fact, I think they enjoy
playing mind games.

225
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,520
That's bullshit.

226
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:38,040
A woman has to do that to push
the guy into a better performance.

227
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:40,440
I just want men and women to get along.

228
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,200
That's it.

229
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:41,960
You know?

230
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:45,720
Keep trying, I think, and you
gotta be aware of what I think.

231
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:49,120
I think it's really difficult
these days to please a woman.

232
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:52,880
You know, it's, you have to be a
professional so it works out perfectly

233
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:56,600
and you gotta know what you're
doing with your banana sometimes.

234
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,240
Banana.
- Yeah.

235
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:03,800
I think, and I think that you've
been drinking a little too much.

236
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:04,960
No, no, no, no.

237
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,320
I just, I didn't drink anything.

238
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:08,080
I just had a glass of milk and that's it.

239
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,080
Michelle, what do you think of all this?

240
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,200
Do you like it?

241
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,000
Well, I've always wanted
a serious relationship, but

242
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,960
I'm a little afraid of sex.

243
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,600
Afraid? Of sex?

244
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,200
What are you paranoid?

245
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,480
What do you mean?

246
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,040
I don't know.
I'm just afraid of it.

247
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,440
If you're not experienced and
you're scared, don't worry about it.

248
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,760
It'll all come together for you.

249
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,480
I used to be scared.

250
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:37,200
Hey, let's talk about our paranoias.

251
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,600
Ooh, I dig this topic.

252
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,120
Hey, what scares you, Jason?

253
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:42,320
Me?

254
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:48,160
I'm scared when I kill a spider, I'm
afraid that thousands of his spider

255
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:53,200
friends will revenge their fellow
spider's death by devouring me.

256
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,480
I have a sick paranoia.

257
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:01,320
I am terrified that deep
in my subconscious.

258
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:04,120
I have the urges of a mass murderer.

259
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,720
Sometimes my mind thinks
these strange thoughts.

260
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,840
I just hope I never act them out.

261
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,960
Somebody call 911.

262
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:22,960
Anyway, listen, my paranoia’s that I'm
home alone and there's someone in the

263
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:28,080
house with me who's after me and all
the noises and creaks that get my mind

264
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:31,000
racing, but then I realize it's only me.

265
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:35,360
Yeah, Monica, I get freaked
out when I'm in a house all alone.

266
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,240
I've got this weird paranoia.

267
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:41,200
It's, it's really more of
a fear about my sex life.

268
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:44,480
Like whenever a girl's giving
me head, I'm always scared.

269
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:47,640
She's gonna like bite my tool off and
throw it in the backyard or something.

270
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,600
That's disgusting.

271
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,920
I've got this weird paranoia.

272
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,480
It's, it's actually more of like
a reoccurring dream, right?

273
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,960
Well, it's no secret that
Monica wants me, right.

274
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:58,960
So

275
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,560
We're all hanging out like
this and it gets late and uh,

276
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:02,920
we all kind of fall asleep.

277
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,080
But Monica can't contain her
passion for me, so the heat of her loins

278
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:10,760
actually ignites a fire and
burns the house down, kills us all.

279
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,520
What about you, Kristine?

280
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,360
What's your fear?

281
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,360
I don't have one.

282
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,640
Come on, Chris.

283
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,960
Last time you sat you had
a paranoia about my brother.

284
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,480
You said he freaked you out, right?

285
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,760
Come on, Kris, tell us
what's going on here.

286
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,600
I don't think my story
will fit this discussion.

287
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:32,440
Kristine, I wanna know, tell
us, I have this paranoia because

288
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,720
Tom's brother cheated on his
wife, which ended their relationship.

289
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:42,640
I'm just afraid that he might
do the same thing to me.

290
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,960
Ooh, that's a tough one.

291
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,400
I'd never cheat on your baby.

292
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,080
Never.

293
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:51,600
Unless you wanted to join us
with Natalie sometimes for, oh.

294
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,360
Hey!

295
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:57,000
The only dude who never
confessed his paranoia was Tom.

296
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,760
Okay, well, I used to be
extremely paranoid person,

297
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,480
[ominous music]

298
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,240
but I'm not like that anymore.

299
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,640
I can control it.

300
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:12,760
In fact, I can show you my
paranoia right here in this house.

301
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:13,920
What are you talking about?

302
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,120
You are a paranoia freak.

303
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,480
How are you gonna show us your paranoia?

304
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:20,880
Just wait a second.

305
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,520
Let me explain everything.

306
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,120
My inspiration came from
Jason's grandmother game.

307
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,720
I have prepared for you something
even more shocking, spectacular.

308
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,760
I will create a paranoia for everyone.

309
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,240
A horror skit, really short skit.

310
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:40,720
I need you all to leave the house
for an hour so I can set everything up.

311
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:46,120
Once you come back, I will
show you my paranoia right here.

312
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,200
Cool.

313
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,080
That sounds like a good idea.

314
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,640
I like fear.

315
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,680
Let's not go anywhere.

316
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:53,720
Let's just stay here.

317
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,200
Just tell us what it is.

318
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:56,840
Don't worry.

319
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,760
This is harmless.

320
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,640
I've thought everything through.

321
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,480
It's gonna be a really short skit.

322
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,480
Let's have some fun.

323
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:06,600
Yeah, but where are we gonna go?

324
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:07,720
Everyone's been drinking.

325
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:08,680
Everyone's been drinking.

326
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:09,800
You're the one who's been drinking.

327
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,000
What's at your fourth now?

328
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:14,440
Come on, let's just stay here and talk.

329
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:15,680
Shut up.

330
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,680
Did your mom pick this outfit up for you?

331
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,760
I think it's an awesome idea.

332
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,240
Okay, let's go then.

333
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:24,960
Hey, this sounds good, Tom.

334
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,400
I'll stick around and help you out.

335
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,240
It should be fun.

336
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:28,560
No, I got this one.

337
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,760
Pete, I'm gonna give
you the keys to the house.

338
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:36,520
After an hour, I want you all to
come back to the house as we never

339
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,400
talked about the skit tonight.
- Okay?

340
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,640
Just come into the house,
sit right here and wait for me.

341
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,320
Okay?
- Alright.

342
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,000
Alright.

343
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:44,680
Let's go.

344
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,680
Sorry, I had to leave urgently.

345
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,240
Explain later, Tom.

346
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,680
Yeah, right.
What's a sickie trying to pull?

347
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:43,720
It's part of the skit.

348
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,200
He's trying to mess with our heads.

349
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,160
I kind of like the way it's starting out.

350
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,120
It's not the start.

351
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,160
It's bullshit.

352
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:52,360
Just how I assumed Tom's
just fucking around with us.

353
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,320
Maybe you really had
to leave for some reason.

354
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:55,920
I don't see his car anywhere.

355
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,600
Right you guys, this car isn't, bro.

356
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,480
I, you probably parked
it around the corner.

357
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,680
Well, let's stand here in
the freezing cold all night.

358
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:04,480
Let's just go in.

359
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:08,720
Who’s got the freaking keys, Pete.

360
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:10,680
Hurry up.
Geez.

361
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:11,360
Come on.

362
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:19,800
Oh geez.

363
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:25,520
All right, let the games begin.

364
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,720
It's time to have some fun.

365
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,200
I wonder what he is up to?

366
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:31,560
Where is he?

367
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,400
God, it’s cold.

368
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:36,680
I give him like 10 minutes

369
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:37,920
and then I’ll leave it.

370
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:43,960
Pleasant surprise.

371
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,960
Yeah, it's a little different.

372
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,440
I'm so excited.

373
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:56,120
Hey, hey, let's, let's turn off the lights.

374
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,720
Nothing's going to happen.

375
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,800
Be patient, Vic.

376
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:00,840
Hey, who wants a beer?

377
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:01,800
Hey, score me one.

378
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:02,720
Get me one too.

379
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,640
Hey, get yourself one sweet cakes.

380
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,160
Oh, thank you so much.

381
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,560
You're so sweet, bastard.

382
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,840
Don't worry, I got you covered.
- No, no.

383
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,720
Hey guys, let's just stay
put and wait for tom’s skit.

384
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,240
What are you, Tom's assistant?

385
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,480
[Scary sound]

386
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:17,480
What was that?

387
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,200
It's a raccoon.

388
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:24,920
[suspenseful music]

389
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:26,560
Shhh, guys.

390
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,720
I bet you Tom started his skit.

391
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:31,720
Are you guys nuts?

392
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,800
I don't hear anything.

393
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:35,640
Yeah, it sounds like somebody's crying.

394
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:37,320
Oh my god.

395
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,600
Somebody's crying in the basement.

396
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,960
It's not coming from the basement.

397
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,160
It has to be from somewhere else.

398
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:44,880
But where?

399
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,600
Don’t worry, we'll figure it out.

400
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,080
It's in the backyard.

401
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,400
No, I'm positive it's in the basement.

402
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:53,560
No way, dudes.

403
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,280
It's totally coming from outside.

404
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,040
Basement.

405
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,240
It's gotta be the basement.
- Oh, okay.

406
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:59,960
You guys are telling me that
there's someone in the basement

407
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,520
crying, who needs help.

408
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,400
I'm gonna check it out.

409
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:05,280
Anyone else coming?

410
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,080
What are you chicken?

411
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,000
Just go by yourself.

412
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,960
Maybe somebody should go with him.

413
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,360
Hey, here, Jason.
Here's what you go down

414
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,200
to the basement.

415
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,480
Locate this, uh, psycho who's crying.

416
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:16,640
All right?
Sort everything out.

417
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:17,800
If you need help, just give us a signal.

418
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:18,880
We'll come down and help you.

419
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:19,720
Thanks a lot bud.

420
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:23,480
Go already, go right.

421
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:25,320
Fine.

422
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,520
Bye-bye

423
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:32,240
so long my friends, I'm going
to unite with my grandmother

424
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:05,560
Tom, you down here?

425
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,440
Tom.

426
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:10,240
You down here?

427
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:10,920
Tom.

428
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,600
Tom, come on.

429
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:16,440
You're scaring me.

430
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,120
Hey, we're all upstairs waiting for you.

431
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:20,920
What's going on?

432
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:23,960
Are you setting up your skit?

433
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:27,200
Still, Tom, c’mon Tom, you're scaring me.

434
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:35,000
Tom, you hanging out in the basement
again by yourself trying to trick us.

435
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,760
[crying sound]

436
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,680
Granny?

437
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:55,920
What are you doing here?

438
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,640
[dramatic music]

439
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:11,000
What is that psycho doing down there?

440
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,560
What about the guys?

441
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,440
They're a lot different here than Seattle?

442
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:04,320
Uh, no, the guys are pretty much the
same it seems, you know, I mean, like

443
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:10,760
this one, it's the people are generally
a little different, but you know, I,

444
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,240
most people I've met are pretty nice.

445
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:18,000
Wait, but um, listen,

446
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,160
the crying stopped.

447
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:25,680
Let's go.

448
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:26,880
No, no, no, no, no.

449
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,320
We have to wait for Jason's signal.

450
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,760
This is bullshit.

451
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:32,840
I'm getting bored.

452
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,240
Let's either fucking do
something or go home.

453
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,000
You know what?

454
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,080
I gotta go.

455
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:40,360
Where are you going?

456
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,000
You're leaving.
- No.

457
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,680
So where do you have to go?

458
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:44,800
Nature calls.

459
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:45,920
Don't take too long.

460
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,200
You might miss something.

461
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:56,800
[tense music]

462
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:06,480
I guess when I drove over the curb,
I like broke the axle or something, so

463
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:08,000
I'm completely screwed this summer.

464
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,800
I don't even know how
I'm gonna get to work.

465
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:10,520
Yeah.

466
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:11,960
So my sister's taken
off moving to Cincinnati.

467
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,320
Turns out I get her new car.

468
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,040
Which

469
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:17,040
you know, powder blue's gonna have
to go, but I figure it's got potential,

470
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:20,240
you know, repaint it, put some rims
on it think could be cool, you know?

471
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,280
Seriously.

472
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,480
Is Monica all right?

473
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,080
She's fine.
Whatever.

[Window slamming sound]

475
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:28,320
Yeah, there it is.

476
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:29,320
That's the signal.

477
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,040
Let's go.

478
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:31,280
Finally.

479
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:34,280
So excited.

481
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,080
I’ll be right out.

482
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:39,960
Just a second.

[tense music continues]

484
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,760
Shut up.

486
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:52,280
We're coming.

487

Oh god, no.

491
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,640
Shut up.
- Sorry.

492
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,400
I'm just kidding.

493
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:05,880
I wonder what's going on.

Where the fuck are you?

497
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:15,880
Jason, come on.

498
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:16,920
This isn't funny.

Nice.
Almost.

what are we gonna do?

526

Who would do this?

527

Where is Tom?

528
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:54,440
That psycho boyfriend
of yours went too far.

529
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,560
This was not supposed to happen this way.

530
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:58,600
He wouldn't do this.

531
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,240
There's someone else in his house.

532
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:01,520
Have someone else's Tom man.

No, Tom would not he do this.

Will be okay.
I've got the gun now.

Now there's only one bullet, so
we have to make sure that it hits.

Why is this happening?

was nothing we could do.

00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:27,640
Stop.

728
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:30,160
Stop.

729
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,280
Go to hell, you son of the bitch!

730
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:35,480
[Gunshot]

731
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:49,560
[music intensifies]

732
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:22,480
A specialist sorrow accompanies
the passing of someone so young.

733
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,640
All that has been lost.

734
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:31,880
And all that would have been
linger us in our hearts and minds.

735
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:41,000
Michelle, gentle of heart, compassionate
and proud, touched each and every

736
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:48,120
one of us in special ways, a
tragedy for her friends and family.

737
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:55,160
Indeed.
Yet let us not solely mourn, but celebrate

738
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:59,840
for her spirit lives on, we are each of us.

739
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:07,120
Return for heaven allowed
Michelle to be a part of our lives.

740
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:10,520
Ashes to ashes.

741
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:11,600
Dust to dust.

742
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:20,640
May god have mercy on her soul.
In nomine patris et spiritus sancti.

743
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:21,760
Amen.

744
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:46,320
We shouldn't have let this happen.

745
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:50,560
We couldn't have known, I
mean, who would've thought.

746
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:51,920
So we went too far.

747
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:54,560
Nobody thought this
could happen and it did.

748
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:55,800
It's not our fault.

749
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:57,560
Do you think the cops will buy our story?

750
00:52:58,160 --> 00:52:58,960
She's dead.

751
00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:01,280
They're not gonna just let this go.

752
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:03,240
Hey, we were just
trying to have a little fun.

753
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:06,480
That makes it okay?

754
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,200
Michelle.

755
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:11,360
I, I just can't believe it.

756
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:14,080
What if they really look
into what happened?

757
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:15,200
What are they gonna find out?

758
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:18,200
All there's to know that my
brother just dressed up as a granny.

759
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:28,920
And scared her a little bit.

760
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:30,800
That was more than a little bit Tom.

761
00:53:30,920 --> 00:53:34,920
We let this girl think that a psycho offed
her friends, she had a heart condition.

762
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:36,160
You know.

763
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:37,080
Jesus Christ.

764
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:39,200
It's a lot tamer than the
skit you pulled on me.

765
00:53:39,320 --> 00:53:40,680
That was a good one though, right?

766
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:42,400
She was just too innocent.

767
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:44,640
We should have thought what?

768
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:47,800
That she wouldn't care that we were
getting murdered in front of her face.

769
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:50,200
All right, so we weren't thinking.

770
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:51,400
Weren't thinking.

771
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:53,560
Is that the best that you could think of?

772
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:54,400
I don't know.

773
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:57,280
All I'm saying is that we've all
been in that situation in one way or

774
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:59,480
another before and we're still here.
- Yeah, there's a point.

775
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:00,640
We've all been through this.
- Yeah.

776
00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:02,920
Yeah, well she didn’t stick
around for the punch line.

777
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:04,400
This is pathetic.

778
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:08,480
You and your goddamn
brother, just take it easy, okay?

779
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:10,360
Don't pretend you had
nothing to do with this.

780
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:11,200
Don't do that!

781
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:13,040
You're the one who started the stupid game.

782
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:14,560
You can't blame it all on me.

783
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:16,760
She trusted us and we took advantage of it.

784
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:18,040
Next time, we'll just have to do.

785
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:19,000
Next time?

786
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:20,800
Are you fucking serious?

787
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:23,640
This was a person.

788
00:54:28,120 --> 00:54:31,880
Her family is destroyed because of us.

789
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:35,680
Because of our stupid game.

790
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:41,880
She was a living, breathing soul.

791
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:46,080
And we, we ended that.

792
00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:59,680
We took on, we took on a
power that wasn't hours to take.

793
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:07,120
And that just isn’t right.

794
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:49,480
[tense music]
