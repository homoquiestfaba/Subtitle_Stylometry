Thanks, Serge.

Sometimes I think
you're my biggest fan.

52
00:03:47,191 --> 00:03:49,562
Well, I think Rod's got

53
00:03:49,594 --> 00:03:51,229
the market cornered
in that department.

on my heart,

and his assistant manager

00:03:55,132 --> 00:03:57,268
ain't half bad, either.

57
00:03:57,302 --> 00:03:59,705
Speaking of Rod, he called
for you while you were on stage.

58
00:03:59,737 --> 00:04:02,206
- Really? What he say?
- I'll hold.

59

What?
Give me the phone, you jerk!

00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:07,713
Hi, Rod,
what's with the halftime call?

61
00:04:07,745 --> 00:04:09,748
You want to talk to me
about something?

62
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:12,016
- Yeah.
- Something really big?

63
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:14,687
God, Serge, I think
he's gonna pop the question!

00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:17,255
Atta girl! Reel him in, hook,
line and sinker.

and a wedding ring

to keep it that way.

You are one tough bitch,
Champagne,

80
00:04:56,261 --> 00:04:59,765
and for some stupid reason,
I'm crazy about you.

81
00:04:59,797 --> 00:05:02,100
But for some crazy reason,

82
00:05:02,134 --> 00:05:04,770
I'm stupid enough to be the kind
of bitch to keep working here.

83
00:05:04,802 --> 00:05:06,872
I don't know what
it is you guys,

84
00:05:06,905 --> 00:05:11,376
but when I see the music
and hear the lights,

85
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:13,746
it's like something inside me
begins to swell.

a show of a lifetime.

Hell you guys, I love what I do,
but sometimes I get the feeling

93
00:05:33,165 --> 00:05:35,801
these blockheads wouldn't know
if the Mona Lisa walked up

94
00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:37,435
and slapped them
in their face with her dick.

nobody can see straight.

wasn't packing 10 inches.

00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,716

what could happen?

He's still on hold.

Where were... oh!

103
00:05:57,155 --> 00:05:59,090

What the...?

105
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:02,093

I thought that first wacko
was just a fluke,

114

but now
it's a regular deja-poo.

00:06:44,001 --> 00:06:45,903
That's right, he shit himself
right out in public.

117

Right in front of everybody.

118

possess a person

in a public place!

00:32:03,419 --> 00:32:07,657
Oh, Brandy,
you're talking crazy talk.

523
00:32:07,691 --> 00:32:11,528
Wake up and smell the coffee,
Champagne.

524
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:14,530
I just did.

525
00:32:14,563 --> 00:32:20,870
No one's gonna hire a model
with ground beef for legs.

526
00:32:20,904 --> 00:32:23,241
That's nonsense,
and you know it.

527
00:32:25,442 --> 00:32:30,580
Look at me. Look at me.
Look at me!

528
00:32:33,517 --> 00:32:37,453
Everything's gonna be okay,
I promise.

529
00:32:37,486 --> 00:32:39,956
That's easy for you to say.

530
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:44,328
Your calves aren't
full of shrapnel.

531
00:32:45,995 --> 00:32:48,631
The bullets must
have hit an artery.

532
00:32:48,665 --> 00:32:52,403
What are we gonna do?
I got it.

533
00:32:52,435 --> 00:32:55,338
I'll fashion some sort of
makeshift tourniquet.

534
00:32:58,642 --> 00:33:02,546
[whimpering]

535
00:33:05,014 --> 00:33:07,583
Champagne, don't.

536
00:33:07,617 --> 00:33:12,021
Living a life without perfect
calves isn't a life at all.

537
00:33:12,055 --> 00:33:15,293
I'll be in prison,

538
00:33:16,659 --> 00:33:20,897
a prison haunted
by the painful memories

539
00:33:20,931 --> 00:33:22,533
of what could have been.

540
00:33:25,368 --> 00:33:29,572
Help me escape
this life of agony.

541
00:33:29,606 --> 00:33:34,412
Champagne, please,
just let me die.

542
00:33:40,649 --> 00:33:43,687
- Thank you, Champagne.
- I love you, Brandy.

543
00:33:48,692 --> 00:33:51,528
[wailing]

544
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:55,398
[gasping]

545
00:34:00,436 --> 00:34:03,506
Oh, no. Oh, no.
[wailing]

546
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:06,711
[gasping]

547
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:12,950
Oh, no!
[wailing]

548
00:34:12,982 --> 00:34:15,486
[gasping]

549
00:34:24,093 --> 00:34:26,963
[continues wailing]
Oh, God, no.

550
00:34:26,997 --> 00:34:28,699
[gasping]

551
00:34:32,736 --> 00:34:36,640
[continues wailing]
Oh, God, no. God, no.

552
00:34:41,444 --> 00:34:45,015
So, she was
some kind of relative?

553
00:34:45,048 --> 00:34:48,484
I already told you. She was
my adopted half stepsister.

554
00:34:48,517 --> 00:34:50,420
And you say you just opened
the door

555
00:34:50,453 --> 00:34:53,457
and she went down on you.

556
00:34:55,492 --> 00:34:56,859
How many times
do I have to say it?

557
00:34:56,892 --> 00:34:58,161
As many as it takes?

558
00:34:58,194 --> 00:35:01,664
Yes, yes, yes.

559
00:35:01,698 --> 00:35:03,834
- Had she been acting depressed?
- No.

560
00:35:03,867 --> 00:35:05,535
On any medication?

561
00:35:07,069 --> 00:35:09,872
[exhales]

562
00:35:09,906 --> 00:35:12,476
Look, Detective,
if you've got something to say,

563
00:35:12,508 --> 00:35:14,511
say it to my face.

564
00:35:15,979 --> 00:35:17,714
Listen, milk breath.

565
00:35:17,747 --> 00:35:20,216
It appears that your adopted
half stepsister, Brandy,

566
00:35:20,249 --> 00:35:21,684
may have committed suicide.

567
00:35:21,718 --> 00:35:23,120
Are you out of your
freaking mind?

568
00:35:23,153 --> 00:35:25,122
Don't get hysterical!

569
00:35:25,155 --> 00:35:28,591
You got some nerve waltzing
around here in your cheap suits

570
00:35:28,624 --> 00:35:31,727
and your JC Penney shoes,
with the audacity

571
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:35,064
to tell me that my adopted
half stepsister shot herself

572
00:35:35,097 --> 00:35:37,867
repeatedly in the calves
in order to take her own life.

573
00:35:37,901 --> 00:35:40,736
A regular textbook case.

574
00:35:40,769 --> 00:35:42,505
You're the dumbest cop
I ever met.

575
00:35:42,539 --> 00:35:44,941
Yeah? Well, we're all good
at something, sister.

576
00:35:44,975 --> 00:35:47,144
Did it ever occur to you
it could be the same two thugs

577
00:35:47,176 --> 00:35:48,845
that jumped me last night?

578
00:35:48,879 --> 00:35:51,915
- Still waters run deep.
- Get out of my house.

579
00:35:51,948 --> 00:35:53,783
We're not done
with the investigation.

580
00:35:53,816 --> 00:35:55,585
You were done the moment
you walked through this door.

581
00:35:55,618 --> 00:35:57,653
Try this on for size.

582
00:35:57,687 --> 00:35:59,690
A couple of good-time girls
get in over their heads.

583
00:35:59,722 --> 00:36:01,891
The fun and games turned ugly.

584
00:36:01,925 --> 00:36:03,794
And like the saying goes,

585
00:36:03,827 --> 00:36:06,629
"The dish
ran away with the spoon."

586
00:36:06,662 --> 00:36:09,131
That was Brandy's
favorite nursery rhyme.

587
00:36:09,164 --> 00:36:11,734
Oh, God.
[crying]

588
00:36:21,912 --> 00:36:23,780
Fresh.

589
00:36:23,812 --> 00:36:26,782
Hammer. Yeah? Where?
I'm on it. Look, Champagne.

590
00:36:26,816 --> 00:36:29,553
I just received
an all-points bulletin.

591
00:36:29,586 --> 00:36:31,522
Five more public poopings.
I've got to act fast.

592
00:36:31,555 --> 00:36:33,857
Wait, wait. That's it?

593
00:36:33,890 --> 00:36:36,158
First my fiancé, and now
my adopted half stepsister

594
00:36:36,191 --> 00:36:38,060
are both brutally murdered,

595
00:36:38,093 --> 00:36:41,631
and you're not gonna do
a damn thing about it?

596
00:36:41,664 --> 00:36:43,766
Listen, I don't mean to burst
your bubble, Champagne,

597
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:47,838
but without any hard evidence,

598
00:36:47,870 --> 00:36:49,939
my hands are tied.

599
00:36:49,972 --> 00:36:53,709
Give me a call
if you uncover any new clues,

600
00:36:53,743 --> 00:36:56,547
or if someone else you know
is brutally murdered.

601
00:37:00,850 --> 00:37:03,888
[funk music]

602
00:37:07,122 --> 00:37:09,825
Ooh, you're looking so good.

603
00:37:09,859 --> 00:37:11,995
Ooh, I see you.
I see you right there, Sergio.

604
00:37:12,028 --> 00:37:13,597
Hey, Sergio.

605
00:37:16,131 --> 00:37:18,568
[knock on the door]
Come in.

606
00:37:23,772 --> 00:37:26,108
Champagne, baby,
what's going down?

607
00:37:26,142 --> 00:37:29,146
You sound all talking funny.

608
00:37:29,178 --> 00:37:31,247
Look, Serge, I don't want to
beat around the bush,

609
00:37:31,281 --> 00:37:34,952
but Brandy's, well, dead.

610
00:37:34,984 --> 00:37:37,053
- You got any coffee?
- I hope instant's okay.

611
00:37:39,622 --> 00:37:41,758
Serge, what happened
to your pants?

612
00:37:41,790 --> 00:37:43,794
Nothing. I don't know
what you're talking about.

613
00:37:43,827 --> 00:37:45,896
That's a lot of crap,
and you know it.

614
00:37:45,928 --> 00:37:49,198
- Now, what's in your pants?
- Nothing, nothing. I swear. No.

615
00:37:49,231 --> 00:37:52,735
- Oh, God. You shit yourself.
- It was an accident [grins]

616
00:37:52,769 --> 00:37:54,203
You're doing booty bumps,
aren't you?

617
00:37:54,236 --> 00:37:58,941
- [screams] No!
- God. Serge.

618
00:37:58,975 --> 00:38:02,312
[Serge crying]

619
00:38:02,345 --> 00:38:07,350
Look at me. Look at me.
Look at me!

620
00:38:07,383 --> 00:38:10,653
You're higher than a hippie in
a helicopter, and you know it.

621
00:38:10,687 --> 00:38:12,689
They told me
it would feel good.

622
00:38:12,722 --> 00:38:17,160
And it did. It felt real good.
But now I can't stop.

623
00:38:17,193 --> 00:38:19,763
I need more. I need more.

624
00:38:19,796 --> 00:38:22,933
I need more, Champagne.
My ass is hungry.

625
00:38:24,734 --> 00:38:29,139
I'd do anything
for another bump, Champagne.

626
00:38:29,171 --> 00:38:31,907
I'll lick your pussy!

627
00:38:31,941 --> 00:38:36,346
First they took Rod,
then Brandy,

628
00:38:36,379 --> 00:38:40,250
and now you.

629
00:38:40,283 --> 00:38:46,656
I don't know what psycho, sick,
wacko freak job is behind this,

630
00:38:46,689 --> 00:38:51,193
but as God as my witness,
if I have to lie,

631
00:38:51,227 --> 00:38:54,897
steal, cheat, or kill,
I'll make them pay.

632
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:58,802
Or my name ain't

633
00:38:58,834 --> 00:39:03,673
Champagne Horowitz
Jones Dickerson White.

634
00:39:03,707 --> 00:39:06,009
So I've been married
a couple of times.

635
00:39:06,042 --> 00:39:10,213
It's none of your
fucking business.

636
00:39:10,245 --> 00:39:14,818
[phone ringing]

637
00:39:26,495 --> 00:39:29,265
Shaboom Boom Room.

638
00:39:29,298 --> 00:39:32,968
Hi, Al. It's Champagne.
Look, I need the night off.

639
00:39:33,002 --> 00:39:35,372
No way, Champagne.
Who's gonna cover your number?

640
00:39:35,405 --> 00:39:37,173
Get Debbie.
She needs the work.

641
00:39:37,207 --> 00:39:40,911
Debbie? Are you crazy?

642
00:39:40,943 --> 00:39:42,845
Putting that meat grinder on
in your place

643
00:39:42,879 --> 00:39:44,815
is like putting
a bull in a china shop.

644
00:39:44,847 --> 00:39:46,315
Somebody's liable
to lose an eye.

645
00:39:46,348 --> 00:39:48,117
I'm right here.

646
00:39:48,151 --> 00:39:50,854
Well, get someone,
because I ain't coming in.

647
00:39:50,886 --> 00:39:53,723
I'm warning you, Champagne.

648
00:39:53,756 --> 00:39:55,459
You better be on that stage
at 9:00 PM sharp.

649
00:39:55,492 --> 00:39:58,028
Fine.

650
00:39:58,060 --> 00:40:00,796
It's gonna look more like a
murder scene than a strip club.

651
00:40:00,830 --> 00:40:03,133
What's that supposed to mean?

652
00:40:03,165 --> 00:40:05,102
I've got the curse,
you old coot. I'm on the rag.

653
00:40:05,135 --> 00:40:07,203
- So don't wear white.
- Piss off.

654
00:40:07,236 --> 00:40:09,972
Come on.
I'm just yanking your string.

655
00:40:10,006 --> 00:40:12,075
Take a night off, kid.
You deserve it.

656
00:40:12,107 --> 00:40:13,776
Thanks, Al.

657
00:40:13,810 --> 00:40:15,879
Oh, oh, and by the way,

658
00:40:15,912 --> 00:40:17,881
what's the word
on the gangster types?

659
00:40:17,914 --> 00:40:20,350
The pushers.
Where do they go to unwind?

660
00:40:20,383 --> 00:40:22,285
Don Ramon's Mexican
restaurant, south of Market.

661
00:40:22,318 --> 00:40:23,919
Why you asking?

662
00:40:23,952 --> 00:40:25,988
Just curious, that's all.

663
00:40:26,022 --> 00:40:27,758
Well, you know what they say,
Champagne.

664
00:40:27,790 --> 00:40:29,493
Curiosity killed the cat.

665
00:40:29,526 --> 00:40:32,294
Not if the cat swallows
the canary first.

666
00:40:32,327 --> 00:40:35,264
Well, just be careful not to
swallow more than you can chew.

667
00:40:35,298 --> 00:40:38,769
Don't worry, Alzy.
This pussy's got teeth.

668
00:40:38,801 --> 00:40:42,204
[mariachi music]

669
00:40:42,238 --> 00:40:48,078
[♪♪♪]

670
00:40:51,347 --> 00:40:54,051
Shh, it's me, Champagne.

671
00:40:55,885 --> 00:40:58,955
Hola, and welcome to Don Ramon's
Mexican style restaurant,

672
00:40:58,988 --> 00:41:01,892
bar, lounge, and donut shop.

673
00:41:01,925 --> 00:41:04,294
I am your server,
Juanita Bonita...

674
00:41:04,327 --> 00:41:06,062
both: Hi.

675
00:41:06,095 --> 00:41:08,531
- Carmen Carmacita...
- Okay.

676
00:41:08,564 --> 00:41:15,472
Rodriguez Gonzalez Lopez
Gina Rivera.

677
00:41:17,073 --> 00:41:27,115
[speaking Spanish]

678
00:41:27,117 --> 00:41:34,089
[speaking Spanish]

679
00:41:34,122 --> 00:41:35,992
What you like?

680
00:41:36,024 --> 00:41:39,428
I'll have the beef enchilada
plate with extra hot sauce.

681
00:41:39,461 --> 00:41:41,230
Oh, yeah.

682
00:41:41,263 --> 00:41:45,468
A strawberry daiquiri
and a bear claw.

683
00:41:45,501 --> 00:41:50,006
Yeah. And I'll have the
chicken fajitas, chips, salsa,

684
00:41:50,039 --> 00:41:54,278
one cream filled,
a Miller High Life.

685
00:41:56,211 --> 00:41:59,282
You know,
the champagne of beers.

686
00:42:00,649 --> 00:42:03,252
Move it, Chiquita!

687
00:42:03,285 --> 00:42:05,254
Accuse me?

688
00:42:05,287 --> 00:42:08,090
You heard him,
tortilla breath. Pronto, Andale!

689
00:42:12,896 --> 00:42:17,200
So, what if that Champagne
don't play ball, huh?

690
00:42:17,232 --> 00:42:19,035
Yeah, we'll put the screws
to her real good.

691
00:42:21,604 --> 00:42:24,540
And what if she still don't?

692
00:42:24,573 --> 00:42:27,310
Then we'll take her for
a long walk down a short pier.

693
00:42:31,513 --> 00:42:33,916
And still don't?

694
00:42:33,950 --> 00:42:36,019
We'll fashion her
a pair of cement shoes.

695
00:42:39,254 --> 00:42:40,557
- Still don't.
- Look, Johnny...

696
00:42:40,589 --> 00:42:43,359
<i>Ay, ay, ay, papi.</i>

697
00:42:43,392 --> 00:42:45,528
Don't you think you're being
too hard on the [inaudible]?

698
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:47,597
I mean, whoever she is.

699
00:42:47,629 --> 00:42:49,531
Hey, beat it, Rosarita.

700
00:42:49,564 --> 00:42:52,501
Don't you got
some hash to sling?

701
00:42:52,535 --> 00:42:55,906
Yeah, but by the sound of it,
it's already been slung.

702
00:42:55,939 --> 00:42:59,609
God damn it.
Can you believe that?

703
00:42:59,642 --> 00:43:01,444
The lounge singer just up
and quit just like that.

704
00:43:01,477 --> 00:43:04,580
Who are you?

705
00:43:04,613 --> 00:43:06,148
- I new here.
- Damn it.

706
00:43:06,182 --> 00:43:08,450
If they keep hiring more girls,

707
00:43:08,484 --> 00:43:11,354
I'm never gonna be able
to afford that new toaster oven.

708
00:43:11,386 --> 00:43:14,057
Listen, cousin, I better get
that new toaster oven,

709
00:43:14,089 --> 00:43:16,091
or you might find yourself

710
00:43:16,124 --> 00:43:19,061
having a nasty little accident
with a deep fryer.

711
00:43:19,095 --> 00:43:22,598
[laughing]
Who am I kidding?

712
00:43:22,631 --> 00:43:24,533
We're not gonna get
out of here alive

713
00:43:24,566 --> 00:43:26,202
if we don't give
those goons a show.

714
00:43:27,569 --> 00:43:31,207
- Hey, hon, can you sing?
- No.

715
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:32,642
You're hired.

716
00:43:39,649 --> 00:43:41,618
Hey, buddy.

717
00:43:41,651 --> 00:43:43,520
You got something
I can dance to?

718
00:43:43,553 --> 00:43:45,555
- You got it, Mama.
- Right on.

719
00:43:45,588 --> 00:43:48,691
[upbeat music]

720
00:43:48,725 --> 00:43:54,164
[♪♪♪]

721
00:44:21,024 --> 00:44:23,626
You were dynamite out there.

722
00:44:23,658 --> 00:44:25,595
I'm glad you dug it.

723
00:44:25,627 --> 00:44:27,696
Yeah. I could really dig into
something else,

724
00:44:27,729 --> 00:44:30,265
if you catch my drift.

725
00:44:30,298 --> 00:44:34,003
I hear it's mating season
for the bearded clam.

726
00:44:34,037 --> 00:44:37,406
Ooh, now we're talking.

727
00:44:37,439 --> 00:44:41,744
But first I need
a booty bump real bad.

728
00:44:41,778 --> 00:44:46,082
What do you say
you smear my rear, big guy.

729
00:44:46,115 --> 00:44:49,019
Bend over, you back door Betty

730
00:44:49,051 --> 00:44:51,254
and get ready
for the ride of your life.

731
00:44:51,287 --> 00:44:54,624
- Hey, slow down.
- Too late, cream cheeks.

732
00:44:54,656 --> 00:44:56,526
I'm gonna get you speeding
so fast

733
00:44:56,559 --> 00:44:59,062
you'll be burning rubber down
the Hershey highway.

734
00:44:59,095 --> 00:45:01,131
The only highway is my way,
you jive turkey.

735
00:45:01,164 --> 00:45:03,033
You got answers and I want them.

736
00:45:03,066 --> 00:45:04,768
Okay, okay.

737
00:45:04,801 --> 00:45:07,037
- Who's the boss man?
- There ain't one.

738
00:45:07,069 --> 00:45:09,705
Listen, punk.
I only got so much self-control.

739
00:45:09,738 --> 00:45:11,573
No, no. It ain't a dude.
It's a chick.

740
00:45:11,606 --> 00:45:13,042
I want the name, the name.

741
00:45:13,075 --> 00:45:15,110
Dixie Stampede.

742
00:45:15,144 --> 00:45:17,213
What does she have to
with Rod and Brandy?

743
00:45:17,245 --> 00:45:18,747
Nothing.
They just got in the way.

744
00:45:18,781 --> 00:45:21,317
You bastard.

745
00:45:21,350 --> 00:45:23,053
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
I just followed orders.

746
00:45:23,086 --> 00:45:24,788
What's the scam?

747
00:45:24,821 --> 00:45:26,089
She gets you
hooked on the drugs

748
00:45:26,122 --> 00:45:28,058
and then you go to work for her.

749
00:45:28,091 --> 00:45:30,226
She runs a stable of the
cheapest hookers in the country.

750
00:45:30,258 --> 00:45:32,428
What about the ass candy?
Where's the lab set up?

751
00:45:32,461 --> 00:45:35,330
The lab is downtown
in an abandoned warehouse

752
00:45:35,363 --> 00:45:37,766
behind the deserted
shipping dock

753
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:40,202
across from the demolition site
and near the wrecking yard.

754
00:45:40,236 --> 00:45:42,472
I know the place.

755
00:45:42,504 --> 00:45:45,307
Thanks for the info.

756
00:45:45,341 --> 00:45:48,611
Now, beat it before I wise up
and change my mind.

757
00:45:48,644 --> 00:45:51,080
The only thing changing

758
00:45:51,113 --> 00:45:53,382
around here
is your life expectancy.

759
00:45:56,718 --> 00:45:58,155

[both screaming]

782
00:47:43,225 --> 00:47:44,693
[loud popping noise]

783
00:47:45,928 --> 00:47:49,900
[moaning]

784
00:47:51,466 --> 00:47:53,869
[squishing and dribbling]

785
00:48:07,917 --> 00:48:10,587
There you are.
They want an encore, okay?

786
00:48:10,620 --> 00:48:14,324
[gasps] [speaks Spanish]
what happened to him?

787
00:48:14,356 --> 00:48:16,926
He wanted an encore
and a toaster oven.

788
00:48:21,530 --> 00:48:24,301
Tony.

789
00:48:26,035 --> 00:48:28,771
- Yes, Miss Dixie.
- What the hell is going on?

790
00:48:28,803 --> 00:48:30,973
She takes down Johnny the Gun,
one of my top men,

791
00:48:31,006 --> 00:48:33,376
and think she's gonna walk.

792
00:48:33,408 --> 00:48:37,247
But every dog has its day, and
that bitch needs to be fixed.

793
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:39,848
You want me to put her
to sleep permanently?

794
00:48:39,881 --> 00:48:42,651
There's nothing Dixie wants

795
00:48:42,685 --> 00:48:45,689
more than to swat
that frigging little fly girl.

796
00:48:47,555 --> 00:48:52,694
But, unfortunately,
you can't seem to do that.

797
00:48:52,727 --> 00:48:56,298
She's a chick, Tony, a chick.

798
00:48:56,332 --> 00:48:58,301
I know, boss, but she's tough.

799
00:48:58,334 --> 00:49:00,002
And so am I.

800
00:49:02,504 --> 00:49:06,642
I have spent a lifetime
undercutting the competition,

801
00:49:06,676 --> 00:49:10,280
shafting employees,
and building a monopoly.

802
00:49:10,312 --> 00:49:13,950
I'm not about to let some
"dancer" get in the way

803
00:49:13,982 --> 00:49:16,752
of my fast track
to corporate domination.

804
00:49:16,785 --> 00:49:19,488
I want the drugs in the streets
and the hos in the sheets.

805
00:49:19,522 --> 00:49:22,558
I want it done fast.
I want it done cheap.

806
00:49:22,591 --> 00:49:24,426
What's our motherfucking motto?

807
00:49:24,459 --> 00:49:27,597
Mall-Wart, always low prices.

808
00:49:27,629 --> 00:49:29,499
Always.

809
00:49:30,865 --> 00:49:33,468
[panting]

810
00:49:33,502 --> 00:49:36,706
What about that broad,
Champagne?

811
00:49:36,738 --> 00:49:40,475
Champagne. Champagne.

812
00:49:40,508 --> 00:49:43,612
That's all I'm hearing
these days. And I don't like it.

813
00:49:46,348 --> 00:49:50,086
Next time I hear
that hoochie mama's name,

814
00:49:50,118 --> 00:49:52,821
it had better be
in the history books.

815
00:49:52,854 --> 00:49:54,723
<i>Comprende,</i> Tony?

816
00:50:02,064 --> 00:50:04,867
Should I make it look
like an accident.

817
00:50:04,899 --> 00:50:08,738
I don't care, when you do it,
or how you do it.

818
00:50:08,771 --> 00:50:11,408
Just find her and do it.
Do you hear me?

819
00:50:12,908 --> 00:50:18,381
I want that Champagne on ice...

820
00:50:18,814 --> 00:50:23,019
[making long hissing sound]

821
00:50:30,158 --> 00:50:35,631
[hissing sound continues]

[♪♪♪]

823
00:51:08,164 --> 00:51:10,667
Shh. It's me Champagne.

824
00:51:21,544 --> 00:51:24,480
Hold it. Who are you?

825
00:51:24,513 --> 00:51:26,682
Who am I? Who am I?

826
00:51:26,714 --> 00:51:29,718
Yes, who are you?
Your name, out with it.

827
00:51:29,752 --> 00:51:31,954
My name.

828
00:51:31,986 --> 00:51:35,023
My name, my name, my name...
my name is Diana.

829
00:51:35,057 --> 00:51:38,127
Diana Prince, -ton.

830
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:42,531
Well, Diana, Diana Princeton,
this is a private facility.

831
00:51:42,564 --> 00:51:44,833
What are you doing here?

832
00:51:44,867 --> 00:51:47,604
I'm a world renowned
nuclear physicist's

833
00:51:49,504 --> 00:51:52,742
assistant's assistant.

834
00:51:52,774 --> 00:51:56,711
- And?
- And Dixie Stampede sent me.

835
00:51:56,745 --> 00:51:59,182
Oh, why didn't you say so
in the first place.

836
00:51:59,214 --> 00:52:01,216
I don't know.

837
00:52:01,249 --> 00:52:04,186
Welcome to our laboratory,
Ms. Princeton.

838
00:52:04,220 --> 00:52:06,856
My name is Dr. Pete Reedish.
Don't laugh.

839
00:52:06,888 --> 00:52:08,591
Okay.

840
00:52:08,624 --> 00:52:11,828
This is the central
nervous system

841
00:52:11,861 --> 00:52:15,698
for the creation of the uppers
that go into booty bumps,

842
00:52:15,731 --> 00:52:18,734
anal absorption,
shall we say.

843
00:52:18,767 --> 00:52:21,671
Science, after all,
is the name of the game.

844
00:52:21,703 --> 00:52:26,042
I most definitely concur.

845
00:52:26,075 --> 00:52:29,846
Now, tell me, why did Dixie
send you to see me?

846
00:52:29,879 --> 00:52:31,948
Because she thought

847
00:52:31,981 --> 00:52:36,084
you might want
some nuclear physicism.

848
00:52:36,118 --> 00:52:39,589
Where did you say
you were from?

849
00:52:39,622 --> 00:52:41,991
- Hasenpfeffer Incorporated.
- Hasenpfeffer Incorporated.

850
00:52:42,024 --> 00:52:44,894
Yeah, yeah. The schlemiel,
schlimazel department.

851
00:52:44,926 --> 00:52:47,762
That's funny. I used to work
at Hasenpfeffer Incorporated.

852
00:52:47,796 --> 00:52:50,500
- Shit.
- I never heard your name once.

853
00:52:50,533 --> 00:52:53,102
That's funny.
I heard it quite often.

854
00:52:53,135 --> 00:52:55,838
Well, that's funny because
I have a pistol in my pocket.

855
00:52:55,870 --> 00:52:57,606
Well, that's funny.

856
00:52:57,640 --> 00:52:59,775
I thought you were
just happy to see me.

857
00:52:59,807 --> 00:53:01,910
Mae West you're not,
Miss Whoever You Think You Are.

858
00:53:01,943 --> 00:53:03,646
The jig is up.

859
00:53:03,678 --> 00:53:05,747
So it really was a pistol
in your pocket.

860
00:53:05,781 --> 00:53:09,686
Yes. And maybe I was
a little happy to see you.

861
00:53:10,852 --> 00:53:13,188
Not that happy.

862
00:53:13,222 --> 00:53:14,990
You can't blame
a girl for trying.

863
00:53:15,024 --> 00:53:17,126
You're not actually

864
00:53:17,158 --> 00:53:19,995
a nuclear physicist's
assistant's assistant, are you?

865
00:53:20,028 --> 00:53:22,297
Guilty.

866
00:53:22,330 --> 00:53:24,901
You're that Champagne broad

867
00:53:24,934 --> 00:53:28,803
that whacked Johnny the Gun
at Don Ramon's Mexican Style

Yeah.

He had it coming.

00:53:42,685 --> 00:53:46,155
And now, so do you. Tony.

876
00:53:46,187 --> 00:53:47,890
What is it now?

877
00:53:47,923 --> 00:53:50,593
Look who I found
snooping around.

878
00:53:50,626 --> 00:53:52,562
Hey, what did she find out?

879
00:53:52,595 --> 00:53:54,696
Just a few aspects
of the drug trade.

880
00:53:54,729 --> 00:53:56,298
I didn't say a word
about Mall-Wart.

you're 10 seconds away
from a gunpowder facial.

887
00:54:12,347 --> 00:54:14,983
I got it. I knew
those ventriloquist lessons

888
00:54:15,017 --> 00:54:16,886

one of these days.

889
00:54:16,919 --> 00:54:18,721
Shoot her.

890
00:54:18,754 --> 00:54:20,056
Hold it right there.
This is the police.

891
00:54:20,089 --> 00:54:21,724
We have you surrounded.

892
00:54:21,756 --> 00:54:23,758
- Who said that?
- I said freeze.

893
00:54:23,792 --> 00:54:25,761
- You're under arrest.
- Where is that coming from?

894
00:54:25,794 --> 00:54:27,664
Where everything comes,
her mouth.

895
00:54:30,198 --> 00:54:33,269
- And she swallows.
- Hey!

896
00:54:33,301 --> 00:54:35,604
And she takes it up the butt.

897
00:54:35,638 --> 00:54:37,707
- Did you hear that?
- Oh, yeah, up the butt.

898
00:54:37,740 --> 00:54:40,276
Just like you two flamers.

899
00:54:43,946 --> 00:54:46,281
- Where'd she go?
- Hell if I know.

00:54:46,314 --> 00:54:48,783
But if we don't find her,

There's something funny
about that mannequin.

907
00:56:39,761 --> 00:56:42,198
Aside from its dubious size,
man hands,

908
00:56:42,231 --> 00:56:44,399
and a slight appearance
of an Adam's apple,

909
00:56:44,432 --> 00:56:47,268
it looks pretty basic to me.

910
00:56:47,301 --> 00:56:48,838
Yeah.

911
00:56:50,339 --> 00:56:52,742
Yeah, you're probably right.

I'm gonna go over there.

Damn it, Hammer, you scared
the bejesus out of me.

I didn't know you had
any Jesus in you.

Talk to Father O'Malley.

920
00:57:23,939 --> 00:57:26,107
We got a call about a break-in
at the bridal hut.

921
00:57:26,140 --> 00:57:28,176
I didn't think
I'd find you here.

922

Just doing
some late night shopping.

923

We found Johnny's body.

Good, you can add him
to the collection.

You can't go around acting like
the goddamn judge and the jury.

I don't see no one else
coming to my rescue.

- We're working on it.
- So am I.

You can't take law
into your own hands.

929
00:57:46,894 --> 00:57:49,130
Look, Hammer,
there's only been three things

930
00:57:49,164 --> 00:57:50,866
I've ever been
good at in this lifetime.

931
00:57:50,899 --> 00:57:52,902
Dancing and fighting
are two of them.

932
00:57:52,935 --> 00:57:57,173
Oh, yeah. What's the third?

933
00:57:57,205 --> 00:58:00,242
If you have to ask, you're not
the man I thought you were.

934
00:58:02,910 --> 00:58:05,947
Stand back Champagne.
I think she's got the rump rage.

00:58:05,981 --> 00:58:07,883
- Hammer, no.
- I can't take any more chances.

936
00:58:07,915 --> 00:58:09,385
I'm gonna have to put her down.

937
00:58:09,417 --> 00:58:10,952
Hammer, wait, don't.

938
00:58:10,986 --> 00:58:13,955

Girl, your weave is too tight.

1041
01:04:51,986 --> 01:04:53,988
Uh-uh,
you ain't ruining this for me.

1042
01:04:54,022 --> 01:04:55,958
I'm telling Janis
who you really are.

1043
01:04:55,990 --> 01:04:58,759
Watch it you
little fudge packer.

1044
01:04:58,792 --> 01:05:00,761
What did you call me?

1045
01:05:00,794 --> 01:05:03,531
- A butt pirate.
- A what?

1046
01:05:03,564 --> 01:05:06,568
A booty bandit.
A rump ranger.

1047
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:10,539
A turd burglar.
A brownie [indistinct].

1048
01:05:10,571 --> 01:05:12,774
Listen to me
you little fruit fly,

1049
01:05:12,807 --> 01:05:15,611
At least I'm not some
middle-aged fag hag

1050
01:05:15,644 --> 01:05:17,979
with fake titties
and bogus conspiracy theories

1051
01:05:18,013 --> 01:05:20,482
wiggling her fat ass
up and down the aisle

1052
01:05:20,515 --> 01:05:22,017
of some
discount department store

1053
01:05:22,050 --> 01:05:24,385
looking for some
cut-rate revenge.

1054
01:05:31,825 --> 01:05:33,594
Come here.

1055
01:05:33,627 --> 01:05:35,530
- I missed you.
- I missed you too, baby.

1056
01:05:35,562 --> 01:05:38,399
- Thanks.
- You look so good.

1057
01:05:38,432 --> 01:05:42,271
Sergio. There you are.
Just the person I wanted to see.

1058
01:05:42,303 --> 01:05:46,742
Listen, it was very close
and it was very tight,

1059
01:05:46,774 --> 01:05:50,378
but the votes are all in,
and you have been chosen

1060
01:05:50,412 --> 01:05:52,714
as employee of the month.

1061
01:05:54,848 --> 01:05:58,953
Sergio, you must be so happy.

1062
01:05:58,986 --> 01:06:01,990
I know I would be if I were you,

1063
01:06:02,022 --> 01:06:07,428
a young boy emasculated by his
desire to lay with another man,

1064
01:06:07,461 --> 01:06:10,965
desperately trying to claw
his way out of the closet

1065
01:06:10,999 --> 01:06:14,669
and prove himself
in a bigoted society.

1066
01:06:14,702 --> 01:06:18,306
Finally recognized
by his mentor,

1067
01:06:18,339 --> 01:06:22,443
a compassionate
and beautiful woman

1068
01:06:22,477 --> 01:06:26,649
who saw a glimmer of hope in
the eyes of a misfit homosexual.

1069
01:06:29,017 --> 01:06:32,754
[singing] God bless America,

1070
01:06:33,787 --> 01:06:37,760
land of the free.

1071
01:06:38,693 --> 01:06:40,495
[glass clinks]

1072
01:06:41,930 --> 01:06:44,031
There will be cake
and punch served

1073
01:06:44,064 --> 01:06:45,599
in the employees lounge, okay?

1074
01:06:45,633 --> 01:06:47,035
Buh-bye.

1075
01:06:48,470 --> 01:06:52,341
Champagne, I'm scared.

1076
01:06:52,374 --> 01:06:54,343
Just play along.

1077
01:06:54,376 --> 01:06:56,078
I'll think of something.

1078
01:06:56,111 --> 01:06:58,013
What? You mean you want me

1079
01:06:58,046 --> 01:07:01,383
to let them sell my ass to
the first John that comes along?

1080
01:07:01,415 --> 01:07:04,352
Like that's a stretch.

1081
01:07:04,385 --> 01:07:07,822
I'm sure there've been
plenty of mornings

1082
01:07:07,856 --> 01:07:11,026
you've woken up next
to a complete stranger

1083
01:07:11,059 --> 01:07:14,363
who's hair and teeth weren't
his own and his crotch smelled

1084
01:07:14,396 --> 01:07:16,865
of baby powder and baloney.

1085
01:07:16,897 --> 01:07:19,367
Oh, hell, we all have.

1086
01:07:19,401 --> 01:07:21,770
But this time
you're doing it for money.

1087
01:07:21,803 --> 01:07:24,772
Sure, it's illegal.
Sure, it's sleazy.

1088
01:07:24,805 --> 01:07:28,008
This whole stinking world's
a cesspool waiting to overflow.

1089
01:07:28,042 --> 01:07:29,877
But you're gonna grin
and bear it

1090
01:07:29,910 --> 01:07:32,481
because that's what
I'm telling you to do, see.

1091
01:07:32,513 --> 01:07:34,782
I'm gonna stop them.
I swear I will.

1092
01:07:34,816 --> 01:07:37,118
I just need some more time

1093
01:07:37,151 --> 01:07:39,820
and you're gonna buy it
with your body.

1094
01:07:39,854 --> 01:07:43,692
[♪♪♪]

1095
01:07:43,725 --> 01:07:46,395
I want to put an all points
bulletin out from one

1096
01:07:46,428 --> 01:07:48,830
Champagne Horowitz
Jones Dickerson White.

1097
01:07:48,863 --> 01:07:51,165
So she's been married
a couple of times.

1098
01:07:51,198 --> 01:07:53,001
It's none of your
fucking business.

1099
01:07:53,033 --> 01:07:55,136
I don't want her harmed,
you got that?

1100
01:07:55,169 --> 01:07:57,805
We need to bring her in
for her own safety.

1101
01:07:57,839 --> 01:08:00,107
I got a feeling she's about
to walk right into the middle

1102
01:08:00,140 --> 01:08:03,845
of a hornet's nest
filled with killer bees.

1103
01:08:09,450 --> 01:08:12,019
Of course, Horton.

1104
01:08:12,053 --> 01:08:14,522
I'll send someone
over immediately.

1105
01:08:19,660 --> 01:08:24,865
Tony, it's time.
Bring in the next whore.

1106
01:08:24,899 --> 01:08:27,936
[whimpering]

1107
01:08:27,968 --> 01:08:30,638
Oh, this one's named Sergio.

1108
01:08:30,672 --> 01:08:33,742
Welcome to my stable, Sergio.

1109
01:08:33,775 --> 01:08:40,482
Turn around.
Nice butt... tight, firm.

1110
01:08:40,515 --> 01:08:42,918
Even on sale,
we could get a good price

1111
01:08:42,950 --> 01:08:45,220
for a cum dumpster like that.

1112
01:08:45,253 --> 01:08:48,924
Now let's see a smile.

1113
01:08:48,957 --> 01:08:50,225
Mm-mm.

1114
01:08:50,257 --> 01:08:52,126
I said, smile.

1115
01:08:52,894 --> 01:08:56,530
[groans]

1116
01:08:56,564 --> 01:08:59,668
And that's more like it.

1117
01:08:59,700 --> 01:09:02,803
I just got off the phone
with Horton Mills.

1118
01:09:02,837 --> 01:09:05,674
It seems the head of Citizens
for Morality

1119
01:09:05,707 --> 01:09:09,744
is into anonymous gum jobs.

1120
01:09:09,776 --> 01:09:11,512
Knock his teeth out
and send him over.

1121
01:09:11,546 --> 01:09:13,748
You got it, Miss Dixie.

1122
01:09:13,780 --> 01:09:16,551
Please, not my teeth.
I just had them veneered.

1123
01:09:16,583 --> 01:09:17,819
Move it, dick bait.

1124
01:09:20,622 --> 01:09:22,656
But what about my cake
and punch?

1125
01:09:22,690 --> 01:09:24,893
Oh, you'll get your punch.

1126
01:09:24,926 --> 01:09:27,762
[laughing hysterically]

1127
01:09:27,794 --> 01:09:29,832
[knock on the door]
What?

1128
01:09:37,605 --> 01:09:39,908
They sent me
up from maintenance

1129
01:09:39,940 --> 01:09:42,610
to unclog your chimney.

1130
01:09:42,644 --> 01:09:45,747
Fine, but make it quick.

1131
01:09:45,779 --> 01:09:47,848
I'm real busy.

1132
01:09:47,882 --> 01:09:49,551
Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am.

1133
01:09:50,952 --> 01:09:54,222
[phone rings]

1134
01:09:54,254 --> 01:09:57,993
Hello?
Well, hello, Mr. President.

1135
01:09:59,127 --> 01:10:02,731
You want a young lady right now?

1136
01:10:02,763 --> 01:10:05,600
Well, I'm afraid all of our
girls are tied up at the moment.

1137
01:10:05,632 --> 01:10:09,537
No, no, I'm sure I could
scrape up something for you.

1138
01:10:09,570 --> 01:10:11,071
What kind of lady
did you have in mind?

1139
01:10:11,105 --> 01:10:15,577
Classy? Sexy?

1140
01:10:20,147 --> 01:10:22,251
Refined?

1141
01:10:24,752 --> 01:10:28,022
I've got just the girl.
I'll send her right over.

1142
01:10:28,056 --> 01:10:30,191
Hey, you.

1143
01:10:30,223 --> 01:10:32,127
You talking to me?

1144
01:10:32,159 --> 01:10:34,662
Yeah, I'm talking to you.

1145
01:10:34,695 --> 01:10:37,565
Look, I'm gonna need you

1146
01:10:37,598 --> 01:10:41,569
to perform some
extracurricular activities.

1147
01:10:41,602 --> 01:10:43,805
Now, what I'm gonna ask you

1148
01:10:43,837 --> 01:10:47,575
to do isn't exactly
in the employee handbook.

1149
01:10:47,609 --> 01:10:50,946
- Is it illegal?
- In most states.

1150
01:10:50,979 --> 01:10:53,815
Ma'am, are you asking me
to prostitute myself?

1151
01:10:53,847 --> 01:10:56,984
I'm not asking you,
grease monkey, I'm telling.

1152
01:10:57,017 --> 01:11:00,087
Now, the only trouble
is the client,

1153
01:11:00,120 --> 01:11:05,092
and this is a really big client,
mind you, wants a woman,

1154
01:11:05,126 --> 01:11:07,095
but, unfortunately, we don't
have any available

1155
01:11:07,128 --> 01:11:08,997
at the moment.

1156
01:11:09,029 --> 01:11:13,000
So I'm gonna need for you to
dress in drag for the evening.

1157
01:11:13,034 --> 01:11:15,704
Can you handle it?

1158
01:11:15,736 --> 01:11:19,274
Well, I never cross-dressed
before.

1159
01:11:19,306 --> 01:11:21,141
The panties cling a bit,

1160
01:11:21,175 --> 01:11:23,278
and your toes most definitely
will hang over your shoes,

1161
01:11:23,311 --> 01:11:25,880
but you'll get used to it.

1162
01:11:25,913 --> 01:11:28,783
The real problem
is gonna be your size.

1163
01:11:28,815 --> 01:11:31,986
With such a large masculine man,

1164
01:11:34,689 --> 01:11:37,793
your body must be surging
with testosterone.

1165
01:11:41,162 --> 01:11:44,132
You know, never really thought
I was all that manly.

1166
01:11:44,164 --> 01:11:46,266
Oh, you are.

1167
01:11:46,300 --> 01:11:49,003
Getting you to pass for a woman
is not gonna be easy,

1168
01:11:49,037 --> 01:11:50,638
and finding a dress
in your size,

1169
01:11:50,672 --> 01:11:53,808
is gonna be even harder.

1170
01:11:53,841 --> 01:11:57,745
We'll have to see what we can
find in the plus size section,

1171
01:11:59,247 --> 01:12:02,249
possibly
the maternity department.

1172
01:12:02,283 --> 01:12:05,787
Hell, I've got a slip cover
from my couch at home.

1173
01:12:05,820 --> 01:12:07,822
I'm sure
you can find something.

1174
01:12:07,855 --> 01:12:09,357
- It's a sectional.
- Got it.

1175
01:12:09,390 --> 01:12:11,325
Seats eight.

1176
01:12:11,359 --> 01:12:13,028
You know what?
I'll get my own outfit.

1177
01:12:13,061 --> 01:12:14,630
Attaboy.

1178
01:12:15,829 --> 01:12:17,798
The dick's been dropped.

1179
01:12:20,101 --> 01:12:23,171
[giggles] Hey, what's with
the new janitor outfit,

1180
01:12:23,204 --> 01:12:25,740
some kind of kinky new fetish?

1181
01:12:25,772 --> 01:12:27,376
- You can say that.
- Yeah.

1182
01:12:29,110 --> 01:12:31,780
Hey, there's something
real fishy about you.

1183
01:12:31,812 --> 01:12:34,281
Yeah?
Well, I got a real fishy face.

1184
01:12:34,315 --> 01:12:36,818
Come on, Tony.

1185
01:12:36,851 --> 01:12:39,688
You've seen one maintenance man,
you've seen them all.

1186
01:12:39,721 --> 01:12:42,790
I'll buy the maintenance part,
but not the man.

1187
01:12:42,824 --> 01:12:44,593
[screams]
Ouch!

1188
01:12:48,462 --> 01:12:50,097
You mean she's not a man?

1189
01:12:50,131 --> 01:12:51,767
Okay, you know what?
Go to hell.

1190
01:12:53,767 --> 01:12:57,872
Oh, my God [whimpering] No, no.

1191
01:13:00,107 --> 01:13:03,011
It's that broad that's been
given us so much trouble.

1192
01:13:03,043 --> 01:13:07,181
Well, Miss Champagne,
we meet at last.

1193
01:13:08,949 --> 01:13:14,355
[slaps and gasps]

1194
01:13:16,356 --> 01:13:20,461
[slaps and gasps continue]

1195
01:13:22,230 --> 01:13:24,066
[slapping noise]

1196
01:13:25,967 --> 01:13:27,402
You're not gonna
get away with this.

1197
01:13:27,435 --> 01:13:29,404
Oh, but I already have.

1198
01:13:29,436 --> 01:13:32,473
Take Champagne to the penthouse.

1199
01:13:32,507 --> 01:13:35,343
And...

1200
01:13:35,376 --> 01:13:39,780
have Dr. Reedish fill her
sweet, brown Rose full of smack.

1201
01:13:39,814 --> 01:13:42,450
Oh, God, no. Please, no.

1202
01:13:42,482 --> 01:13:47,288
And when she's good
and strung out,

1203
01:13:47,320 --> 01:13:50,190
you can slice that hair pie.

1204
01:13:50,223 --> 01:13:52,159
- [laughter]
- No. No.

1205
01:13:52,193 --> 01:13:53,861
Or...

1206
01:13:56,129 --> 01:14:01,035
Drill for oil in that skanky
prune danish.

1207
01:14:02,803 --> 01:14:05,205
Once you're done with her,
you can sell her

1208
01:14:05,239 --> 01:14:07,809
into white slavery
on the black market.

1209
01:14:07,842 --> 01:14:11,046
- I hate you.
