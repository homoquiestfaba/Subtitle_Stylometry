20
00:03:20,208 --> 00:03:23,791

00:03:24,458 --> 00:03:26,041

00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:57,375
- Don't sweat it, the plan is simple!

31
00:03:57,541 --> 00:03:59,708
- Simple?!

32
00:03:59,875 --> 00:04:02,958
- Sure... You glide down the hill and up under
the car, lay the bomb in there, pull on the string...

33
00:04:03,125 --> 00:04:06,125
- ... and we pull ya out.
- OK!

34
00:04:06,291 --> 00:04:08,708
- I gotta burn one...

35
00:04:08,875 --> 00:04:11,333
- Hang on to the bomb.

36
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:14,416
- Did you tie the line to the board?

37
00:04:14,583 --> 00:04:17,583
- Stay cool. This shit ain't killed nobody yet...

38
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:20,333

00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:23,000

00:04:33,208 --> 00:04:37,125
- Bomb's installed.
- Pull the string...

41
00:04:37,291 --> 00:04:39,875
- Johnny, my man!!! You hangin' in there?
- Where's the string!?

42
00:04:40,041 --> 00:04:43,041
- Cool out. It's right here...
- FUCK!!! How do I get outa here?!

43
00:04:43,208 --> 00:04:46,750
- Don't panic. I gotta think...

44
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:53,041
- AFRO!!! - What's up?
- FUCK!!!

45
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:56,291
- Ah... When the car moves, just let go,
and they'll keep on drivin'.

46
00:04:56,458 --> 00:05:01,458
- But the bomb's gonna blow!
- Then set the timer for 10 secondz...

47
00:05:02,625 --> 00:05:05,541
- We're outa here!

48
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:10,791
- You into Hanna-Barbera cartoonz?
- Why you askin'?

49
00:05:10,958 --> 00:05:14,708
- Just curious...
- Gotta let go.

50
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:17,458
- I'm stuck!

51
00:05:18,291 --> 00:05:21,250
- FUCK! FUCK! FUCK!

52
00:05:31,375 --> 00:05:35,416
- My whole life's passin' before my eyes.

53
00:05:35,791 --> 00:05:38,541
- Aaaaaaaaaa!!!

54
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:42,458
- Aaaa!

55
00:05:42,958 --> 00:05:46,250
- I dig American movies...

56
00:05:49,291 --> 00:05:52,708
- Yo, I think we got a flat.

57
00:06:00,625 --> 00:06:03,166
- Johnny!!!

58
00:06:06,958 --> 00:06:09,500
- Freeze!!!

59
00:07:35,541 --> 00:07:38,291
BACK @ JOHNNY'S

60
00:07:39,291 --> 00:07:42,125
- No shit, we really coulda died...

61
00:07:42,291 --> 00:07:44,750
- Yeah...

62
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:48,125
- I ever tell y'all about The War of The Gangz?

63
00:07:48,291 --> 00:07:50,375
- 'Round 15 seconds ago.

64
00:07:50,541 --> 00:07:52,458
- Good shit!!!

65
00:07:52,625 --> 00:07:55,083
- Yeah...

66
00:07:55,458 --> 00:07:58,625
- We coulda died in space, too...
- I remember that like it was two dayz ago!

67
00:07:58,791 --> 00:08:04,166
SPACE
...It was a warm summer day...

68
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,833
- Hey guys!
- Hey, what's happenin'...

69
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,833
- Wanna take a journey into deep space?

70
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,833
- Why not...
- Then go pack your stuff...

71
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,833
ONE HOUR LATER...

72
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,833
- I see you didn't have any problems making yourselves at home.

73
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,833
- Nah...
- Except all the windows are stuck.

74
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,833
- I see...
- General...
- What's up?

75
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,833
- How come we're here? I mean NASA doesn't just send people into space like this, for the hell of it.

76
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,833
- Mmm... We're gonna hook up with an interplanetary research station...

77
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,833
- Yeah, but why us?

78
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,833
- Aah... I see you're not gonna let this go. You really wanna know?

79
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,833
- Of course!
- Alright, listen up!

80
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,833
- Wha... what's the deal?
- I need to tell you guys something...

81
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,833
- A year ago NASA deployed a crew of quite a few to an interplanetary research station..

82
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,833
- ... somewhere in the area of Saturn. We should be there soon...

83
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,833
- ... the mission was supposed to be very simple. The entire crew was to return after 6 months...

84
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,833
- ... several weeks into their stay we began to receive some disturbing signals...

85
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,833
- ... 2 months ago we lost their signal entirely.

86
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,833
- What was in those signals?

87
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,833
- It's hard to say... cries, screams, noise... all at once.

88
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,833
- Then why are you sending us? NASA's got astronauts.

89
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,833
- Because this is a fatally dangerous mission, it's a foregone conclusion that you're gonna die...

90
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,833
- ... and since you guys volunteered for it yourselves, NASA won't have to pay out any insurance claims in case of death...

91
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,833
- We gotta streamline, after losing all of our money...

92
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,833
- ... on caps with a logo that read: "I LOVE THE USA".

93
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,833
- The ones with the little read heart on them?
- Yeah.

94
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,458
- Those things are so cool! I bought four myself.

95
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:56,083
- Welcome to the "Omega 17" Interplanetary Research Station...

96
00:09:57,208 --> 00:10:00,416
- This isn't that bad...

97
00:10:02,666 --> 00:10:04,500
- Lemme outa here!

98
00:10:04,666 --> 00:10:06,708
- That's probably just the plumbing...

99
00:10:06,708 --> 00:10:06,708
- This is the central computer. Ask it anything you want.

100
00:10:10,833 --> 00:10:12,666
- Anything?
- Yes.

101
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:15,583
- What's your name?
- Betty.

102
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:20,458
- OK, Betty - what came first: the chicken or the egg?

103
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:22,458
- You know how much that thing cost!!!

104
00:10:22,791 --> 00:10:25,583
- But it doesn't even work...

105
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:28,416
- Let's see if we can find anybody from the old crew.

106
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,833
- This station's pretty big. I propose we split up.

107
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,958
- Alright.
- Each of us will go in a different direction...

108
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,833
- Wait!
- What's up...

109
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,500
- Hold it!

110
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,833
- Get away from here!
- IT will kill you all!!!

111
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,833
- What are you talking about?

112
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,833
- Aaaaaaaaaaa!!!
- What's the matter?

113
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,708
- Who are you?

114
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,500
- Help me!

115
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,833
- Are you OK?
- Yeah. Everything's cool.

116
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,791
- What WAS that?

117
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,833
- What happened here?

118
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,833
- I don't feel like running anymore...

119
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,833
- Something attacked us...

120
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,833
- We need to let the General know.

121
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,833
- Go look for him!

122
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,041
- I'll see if I can find that other dude.

123
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,458
- Fuck...

124
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,333
- Shit!

125
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,458
- HELP!!!

126
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,833
- We've gotta get out of here.

127
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,833
- There's no one left on the station. We're going back to Earth, otherwise IT's gonna kill us.

128
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,833
- I'm afraid that's not possible...
- How come?

129
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,833
- NASA didn't count on us surviving...

130
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,833
- Our ship was a one-shot kind of thing. It won't get us back to Earth.

131
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,833
- There's no other way back?

132
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,833
- We could fly the whole research station back. But before we do that...

133
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,833
- ... we really should kill that THING. It could escape once we landed.

134
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,833
- The entire World would be at risk!

135
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,791
- Only America can save the Earth...

136
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:57,833
- Get the station ready for the return journey. I'll take care of that THING!

137
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,458
- Fuck...

138
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,833
- NO!!!!!
... No!!!...

139
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,458
- Johnny!

140
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,833
- What happened here?

141
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,791
- I killed IT...

142
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,833
- Cool...
- Let's go back to Earth.

143
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,333
- OK...

144
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,750
BACK @ JOHNNY'S

145
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,833
- That was one hell of a dangerous mission...

146
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,833
- Yeah...

147
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,458
- We saved the whole World...

148
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,833
- Yeah...
- We coulda died in 'Nam, too...

149
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,833
- I remember that like it was yesterday!

150
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,333
VIETNAM

151
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,833
...It was a warm summer day...

152
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,833
...but we were hangin' out inside the house...

153
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,791
...Help! Lifeguard! I'm drowning!...

154
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,833
- Great flick!

155
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,833
- Switch it to somethin' else.

156
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,583
...TU MIS COCHONES, PEPITO!!!...

157
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,833
- Switch it again.

158
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,833
Do you want Adventure?

159
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,750
Enlist with the United States Army!

160
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,166

- Wow! A waterproof watch.

00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,416
- You can even take a bath with that thing on...

165
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,208
SEVERAL MINUTES LATER...

166
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,833
- Hi!
- General?!

167
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,833
- You gotta work your way into everything?
- I wanna be famous...

168
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,833
- What do you guys want?

169
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,833

00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,166

00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,833
- Congratulations! You're goin' to 'Nam!

- And the watch?

173
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,750
- Oooh... Sorry, we're fresh out...

174
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,833
ONE HOUR LATER...

175
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,250
SOMEWHERE OVER VIETNAM...

176
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,833
- Alright, we're over Vietnam now.

177
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,833
- You're gonna jump in a second.

178
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,833
- What exactly is our mission here?

179
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,833
- Hmm... to kill 'em all!

180
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,833
- Wipe out Vietnam!

181
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,833
- But the war in Vietnam is over, isn't it?

182
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,833
- That's what THEY want you to think!!!

183
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,833
- We still got guerilla cells holed up in the jungle!!!

184
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,833
- They're a threat to American tourists.

185
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,833
- But nobody takes a vacation in the jungle.

186
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,166
- Exactly! They're afraid of the guerillas!

187
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,833
- You can jump now.
- What about weapons?

188
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,833
- Fuck...
- I forgot.

189
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,750
- Deal with it!

190
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,833
- Don't we get parachutes?

191
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,833
- No! With parachutes they'll shoot you down!!!

192
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,041
- Besides, Afro and Nigga already jumped.

193
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:18,250
PLEASE REMEMBER THAT THE CHARACTERS PORTRAYED IN "AMERICAN MOVIE" ARE FICTIONAL AND PLAYED BY ACTORS. FOR YOUR OWN SAFETY, WE STRONGLY RECOMMEND THAT YOU DO NOT ATTEMPT TO IMITATE THEM.

194
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,833
- You guys make it alright?

195
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,833
- I'm fine.

196
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,833
- How 'bout you, Nigga?

197
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,833
- What's the matter!?

198
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,833
- I got water in my ears...

199
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,833
- Let's take cover somewhere!

200
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,916
- Without weapons we're sitting ducks.

201
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,833
- Up in the trees will be the best place...

202
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:58,208
- I watched this documentary one time, where it said the Vietnamese can't climb 'em!

203
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,833
- When did you see that?

204
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,833
- Today, with y'all. Don't you remember?

205
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,833
- Nigga... That was a film about rhinoceroses...

206
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,333
- Oh...

207
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,833
- Did you guys just see something?

208
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,833
- No...
- Maybe it was a rhinoceros...

209
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,833
A MOMENT LATER...

210
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,833
- I just remembered something...

211
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,958
- There's no rhinoceroses in Vietnam...

212
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:36,416
- Just sittin' around here like this is senseless... I'm goin' down.

213
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,833
- Man, you're fast!
- I try...

214
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,791
- Grab the guns!

215
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,791
- I didn't know humans could talk...

216
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,333
- Look!

217
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,833
- Mission accomplished!
- We can go home now.

218
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,958
- OK... Let's roll!

219
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,833
- Fuck...
- Nigga!!!

220
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,208
- There's a field hospital! We'll carry him!

221
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,833
- Doc! You've gotta save him!

222
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,833
- What happened?

223
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,583
- He took a bullet in the chest!

224
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,250
- Your friend is dying...

225
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,833
- The bullet pierced his heart...

226
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,833
- Can't you do anything!?

227
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,666
- The only possibility would be a heart transplant...

228
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,833
- ... but finding a viable donor in these circumstances would be nothing less than impossible.

229
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,833
- What about all them dead Vietnamese?

230
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,833
- No. The heart's gotta still be beating...

231
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,833
- Can I go see him?

232
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,666
- Go ahead...

233
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,833
- Johnny...
- I'm sorry, man...

234
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,833
- If it wasn't for me, you guys would be home by now...

235
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,833
- It's nothing... Don't think about that.

236
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,833
- Johnny...
- How come the black guys always die first in the movies?

237
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,833
- THIS AIN'T NO MOVIE, NIGGA!!!

238
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,208
- This time things are gonna be different...

239
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,333
- No...

240
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,708
"He's dead..."

241
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,541
"prepare the operating room..."

242
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,833
- So where's Johnny?

243
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,833
- He's dead...

244
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,666
- He gave his life to save you...

245
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,500
- Hang on! If you died then...

246
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,833
- ... then who are we talkin' with!!!

247
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,208
