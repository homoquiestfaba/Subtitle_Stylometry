1
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:36,574
You have made us a nice
ridiculing, or what?

2
00:00:36,701 --> 00:00:41,218
Do you think that we have not seen this?
Do you want people to laugh, Boyd?

3
00:00:46,823 --> 00:00:49,576
That was fun I guess?

4
00:01:13,667 --> 00:01:20,346
Late again.
- I know. Is he angry?

5
00:01:20,468 --> 00:01:23,541
He's not happy.

6
00:01:24,269 --> 00:01:28,229
This, Sheriff. It is normal.
- Thank you, Al.

7
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:32,390
Looks good. For me, the chocolate-
the ball, and sprinkles.

8
00:01:32,511 --> 00:01:37,505
Easy, Hopalong. We are at work.
Give him sherbet.

9
00:01:37,632 --> 00:01:41,261
Is going to happen.
Keep still safe city.

10
00:01:42,032 --> 00:01:45,025
Hello, sloth.

11
00:01:46,433 --> 00:01:51,713
I was advised to not hire
crazy room at the time.

12
00:01:51,834 --> 00:01:55,714
Do not think that I'm an idiot.
- I do not. Sorry.

13
00:01:56,835 --> 00:02:00,385
Put the alarm clock to ring so you will not be haukuta.

14
00:02:06,357 --> 00:02:11,351
You'll do better, Kenny.
- Thank you, Sheriff.

15
00:02:11,478 --> 00:02:16,074
What do you say, Irv?
- I just enjoyed.

16
00:02:16,198 --> 00:02:20,954
I went visiting your mother, and the
exotic oil.

17
00:02:21,079 --> 00:02:25,596
Here you will soon smell like eucalyptus.

18
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:30,920
Boyd, your dress is. You will go
birthday.

19
00:02:31,041 --> 00:02:35,240
Marty Prichard meets the 34
The whole world is celebrating it.

20
00:02:36,082 --> 00:02:42,192
Marty Prichard?
- I. Is that okay?

21
00:02:42,323 --> 00:02:44,883
Come on then.

22
00:02:59,206 --> 00:03:03,359
Can I have ice cream?
- Sure.

23
00:03:11,408 --> 00:03:15,800
Enjoy Delicatessen.
- Thank you.

24
00:03:16,369 --> 00:03:20,124
The message would hit home.
What do you think?

25
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:27,562
It scared him enough.

26
00:03:31,652 --> 00:03:35,486
Hi. -Hi.

27
00:03:35,612 --> 00:03:42,372
What do you recommend?
- Suklaabananza is good.

28
00:03:42,494 --> 00:03:46,965
Bananza ?
- Banana Zalla.

29
00:03:47,094 --> 00:03:51,771
Ridiculous.
- It is gluten.

30
00:03:51,895 --> 00:03:56,651
Can be  hazel. Not allergic.

31
00:03:57,656 --> 00:04:04,005
I'm not allergic to nuts.
- Maybe you want to rommirusinaa.

32
00:04:05,378 --> 00:04:09,132
For each of the ball.

33
00:04:10,539 --> 00:04:14,088
Thank you.

34
00:04:14,219 --> 00:04:18,657
Ken.
- Stephanie. Thank you.

35
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:21,248
Stephanie.

36
00:04:23,261 --> 00:04:28,541
Kenny Boyd, how are you?
A nice that you've got to come.

37
00:04:28,662 --> 00:04:34,579
Look at you. Kenny Boyd...
- Hey, baby.

38
00:04:34,703 --> 00:04:38,697
Have you seen Kenny Boyd?
- Hey, Kenny.

39
00:04:38,824 --> 00:04:44,183
Kivat celebrations, baby. Thank you.
Kenny Boyd...

40
00:04:59,467 --> 00:05:01,743
Leave me alone!

41
00:05:03,108 --> 00:05:06,020
Is aspirin?
The head is bursting.

42
00:05:06,148 --> 00:05:09,858
I always have aspirin
ax in case.

43
00:05:10,909 --> 00:05:17,019
Good day to ax arm.
- Kirveelle work.

44
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:21,064
Ax...
- What are you doing?

45
00:05:21,191 --> 00:05:27,791
I thought that play with the word play.
- Why?

46
00:05:27,912 --> 00:05:33,590
Guy has an ax on the forehead, and he was thrown into the
is for my yard.

47
00:05:34,233 --> 00:05:40,070
Yes guy knew his victim...
, And hated him.

48
00:05:40,194 --> 00:05:45,144
Why
gasoline directly onto the body, but it does not burn sytytetä?

49
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:49,554
Therefore, we could find it.

50
00:05:49,676 --> 00:05:55,274
The two had been pushed into his mouth
. What do you think, boss?

51
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:16,197
I do not know.

52
00:06:16,321 --> 00:06:20,440
The former wife would have been able to do that.

53
00:06:27,483 --> 00:06:32,922
What is a day gone?
- A well.

54
00:06:34,044 --> 00:06:38,436
34 years and you say just always good.

55
00:06:38,565 --> 00:06:44,880
Not now, Mom.
- So, it's another thing what you say.

56
00:06:45,006 --> 00:06:51,799
Good. Not now.
Good. Not now.

57
00:07:23,853 --> 00:07:30,646
Paheensa It was he, but he did not know
was a gambler.

58
00:07:30,774 --> 00:07:34,848
Not owe anyone?
- I do not think so.

59
00:07:34,975 --> 00:07:40,653
It seems probably good.
- I do not want to take this speech -

60
00:07:40,776 --> 00:07:44,486
but Marty was quite a lot of other women with
.

61
00:07:45,337 --> 00:07:52,574
When he disappeared, I thought he found a new
someone a slut.

62
00:07:52,698 --> 00:07:55,531
Lutkia?

63
00:07:57,539 --> 00:08:04,093
This guy? Really?
- Can I be honest?

64
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:11,175
I did not kill Marty, but not for me
grieve that he is dead.

65
00:08:11,301 --> 00:08:14,851
Am I a bad person?

66
00:08:15,982 --> 00:08:19,498
Of course not.

67
00:08:28,024 --> 00:08:33,497
Boyd! You change to a new into your house?

68
00:08:34,665 --> 00:08:39,694
Should not you have a padded room in your
paskassasi?

69
00:08:46,748 --> 00:08:50,980
Do you want to make us look ridiculous,
is not it?

70
00:08:52,028 --> 00:08:55,385
So affected.

71
00:08:56,429 --> 00:09:02,539
Do you know what? I will make you
ridiculed. What do you say?

72
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:07,742
Keep up to him.

73
00:09:07,871 --> 00:09:11,911
Oops, he trembles.
He ??was scared.

74
00:09:12,032 --> 00:09:14,945
Just let the blood leak.

75
00:09:17,633 --> 00:09:21,183
Hold on.
- Is it fun, you little devil?

76
00:09:22,114 --> 00:09:24,867
Boyd?

77
00:09:26,115 --> 00:09:29,505
Boyd, get busy street.

78
00:09:29,635 --> 00:09:33,993
The last time, not block those. They have terrible
.

79
00:09:36,796 --> 00:09:41,029
What are ? So, they are not fine
.

80
00:09:49,759 --> 00:09:52,273
Be careful, fagot.

81
00:10:01,961 --> 00:10:06,274
Thank you.
- Not at all. Are you all right?

82
00:10:06,402 --> 00:10:11,112
My back...

83
00:10:12,963 --> 00:10:18,402
Thank you very much.
- What are small. See you.

84
00:10:22,044 --> 00:10:25,162
I got to play basketball before Ronald came.

85
00:10:25,285 --> 00:10:30,360
Ronald has opened my eyes.
I have found my errors.

86
00:10:30,486 --> 00:10:37,245
We are of the opinion that it would be best to
you'll want to bible class.

87
00:10:38,407 --> 00:10:43,641
Shall we go? Jesus did not like it slow.
- But the ugly jumpers will do.

88
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:49,127
Lord, guide this child
on the right path. Amen.

89
00:10:50,129 --> 00:10:53,805
I do not like her attitude.
- I'm talking to him.

90
00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:58,083
I hope the Lord will send me a pizza.

91
00:11:18,894 --> 00:11:24,766
So, do not show to anyone.
Keep your own secret.

92
00:11:39,978 --> 00:11:44,973
I would have taken it.
- And come out of your box?

93
00:11:45,099 --> 00:11:49,616
What kind of mother I would have then?

94
00:11:55,861 --> 00:11:59,696
The doctor said 70% of the
try to commit suicide again.

95
00:11:59,822 --> 00:12:04,738
If you want to do it yourself
you have to earn it.

96
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:48,100
Damn it!

97
00:13:02,473 --> 00:13:05,988
FATHER

98
00:13:31,118 --> 00:13:33,552
See you.

99
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:46,669
Tammyn dress was inappropriate.
After all, it is the church.

100
00:13:46,801 --> 00:13:50,555
You said that the music box is from you.
- Amy, are you scared us.

101
00:13:50,681 --> 00:13:55,995
Music boxes reads that it is from the father.

102
00:13:56,122 --> 00:13:59,081
Do not you know it?

103
00:13:59,203 --> 00:14:03,083
I'm going to make some chamomile tea.

104
00:14:18,006 --> 00:14:23,365
When I met him, he had been
in the hospital because of depression.

105
00:14:25,928 --> 00:14:29,477
He was a
mistake of my life and I wanted to leave it behind me.

106
00:14:29,608 --> 00:14:34,205
You thought about what I wanted.
- I thought your best.

107
00:14:34,329 --> 00:14:39,040
I am 11 years
father had thought lost.

108
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:42,527
I understand that you are up in arms.
- Really?

109
00:14:45,131 --> 00:14:48,249
Do you know where he is?

110
00:14:49,292 --> 00:14:52,523
What does the Lord keep telling lies?

111
00:14:54,773 --> 00:14:57,731
I think he lives in Green Oaks.

112
00:15:00,934 --> 00:15:04,085
What's his name?
- Amy kind.

113
00:15:04,214 --> 00:15:07,127
What is the name of my father?

114
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:46,295
What the hell?
You owe me a hundred.

115
00:15:47,342 --> 00:15:51,939
You said I could drive here
head is all messed up.

116
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:56,216
Guess what, fagot.
I am here.

117
00:15:57,184 --> 00:16:03,943
Shut the fuck up. To keep this going.
Remember the money.

118
00:16:04,585 --> 00:16:06,621
Moron.

119
00:16:07,426 --> 00:16:12,785
I hope you have better stuff than this
, I've been smoking.

120
00:16:14,867 --> 00:16:18,304
What the hell?

121
00:16:20,828 --> 00:16:23,740
What the hell?

122
00:16:24,829 --> 00:16:27,627
I do not come to the movies.

123
00:17:16,078 --> 00:17:20,117
What has been found, Ernie?
- Deceased again. Wade Hutchinson.

124
00:17:20,238 --> 00:17:24,437
Do you have food, too?
- No. I bought just for this.

125
00:17:25,479 --> 00:17:30,952
Do eyewitnesses?
- No. No attempt has been stolen.

126
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:35,154
Wadea not been robbed.
Is in your pocket over $ 200.

127
00:17:35,281 --> 00:17:39,355
This is not  head. Generally, the dead end of the
.

128
00:17:39,482 --> 00:17:44,352
Where is the head?
It is to be found.

129
00:17:44,483 --> 00:17:49,080
Not a man to break the head
unless there is a damn angry.

130
00:17:54,205 --> 00:17:58,403
The head was found, sir.
- Bring it over here.

131
00:18:10,087 --> 00:18:13,558
Is not it fun?

132
00:18:14,808 --> 00:18:18,199
You got what you deserved.

133
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:28,970
Constable Dockins.
- The journalist Gazettesta first division.

134
00:18:37,132 --> 00:18:39,408
Hello.

135
00:18:40,773 --> 00:18:45,973
Do not even told newspapers?
- You heard what the mayor said.

136
00:18:47,014 --> 00:18:52,726
We find that shit
and nyljemme him.

137
00:18:52,855 --> 00:18:56,644
He may keep his own skin at.

138
00:19:05,017 --> 00:19:09,933
We found one of the deceased.
- Really?

139
00:19:10,058 --> 00:19:17,056
Did you know Wade Hutchinson?
- You were school friends.

140
00:19:18,099 --> 00:19:24,255
He said yes.
- Someone made a clear mark.

141
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:29,250
Decapitato. It was a messy-looking.

142
00:19:31,102 --> 00:19:39,021
You will not talk about it to anyone.
It would rise to a terrible uproar.

143
00:19:39,983 --> 00:19:42,942
All right, Sheriff.

144
00:19:45,904 --> 00:19:48,783
I have eaten.

145
00:19:53,866 --> 00:19:58,622
Good boy... but he does not
hurmauskilpailua win.

146
00:20:00,107 --> 00:20:05,580
Here's how it was done in one fell swoop.
A clean cut. Machete?

147
00:20:05,708 --> 00:20:10,499
Maybe a samurai sword.
It would be furious.

148
00:20:10,629 --> 00:20:14,304
It's like your eyes follow the movement.

149
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:20,620
You will be interested as well.

150
00:20:31,592 --> 00:20:37,988
Why is he has a teepee in the chest?
- Teepee?

151
00:20:38,114 --> 00:20:40,867
I think that it is a V.

152
00:20:47,115 --> 00:20:50,074
Yes.
- Maybe.

153
00:20:51,116 --> 00:20:54,267
Why did you let Foogerin keljuilla?
- I do not want trouble.

154
00:20:54,396 --> 00:20:58,788
But that is a problem.

155
00:21:01,478 --> 00:21:07,588
I was looking at having something  exports...
Mad room.

156
00:21:10,599 --> 00:21:16,038
We took the waste loading bay -

157
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:20,473
and there was a jungle mural depicting
.

158
00:21:21,561 --> 00:21:26,272
One patient had painted
it a long time ago.

159
00:21:27,122 --> 00:21:33,835
The container was left behind.
Only a few knew about it.

160
00:21:34,844 --> 00:21:38,200
When the container is moved a bit...

161
00:21:39,244 --> 00:21:46,596
Since it had been in the shade, the colors
had remained beautiful.

162
00:21:47,646 --> 00:21:52,323
Crazy's finger painting?
Is that you hyped up?

163
00:21:52,447 --> 00:21:56,565
The hospital made you zombie.
You have not had reason to be there.

164
00:21:56,687 --> 00:22:03,037
Once again the culprits are in freedom.
Yes, it is lousy.

165
00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:16,361
Let's go. Is cash held?
- Cash? It is.

166
00:22:16,491 --> 00:22:22,362
The pool has been wiped, washed in buckets.
- You forgot to lock the door.

167
00:22:24,612 --> 00:22:27,810
Hi.
- Hello.

168
00:22:27,933 --> 00:22:32,485
Site is closed. She forgot to lock.
- Do you want something?

169
00:22:35,454 --> 00:22:42,248
Well, then. Site has been closed.
- I just wanted to thank... music boxes.

170
00:22:45,016 --> 00:22:48,054
My mother said that you gave it to me -

171
00:22:48,177 --> 00:22:52,090
but he does not want to
that I know about you.

172
00:22:55,898 --> 00:22:59,209
Amy?
- I.

173
00:23:01,739 --> 00:23:05,858
I just came to give thanks.

174
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:12,380
Do not mention it.

175
00:23:13,421 --> 00:23:18,735
I do not think otherwise, then... Good evening.
- The same.

176
00:23:18,862 --> 00:23:21,501
Thank you.

177
00:23:22,543 --> 00:23:25,933
You make good cones.

178
00:23:33,905 --> 00:23:41,335
Daughter? How old is he?
- Eleven.

179
00:23:41,466 --> 00:23:46,700
Who is his mother?
- Janet Wheeler.

180
00:23:50,068 --> 00:23:56,019
The girl with whom you were in a week?
Did you put him thick?

181
00:23:57,429 --> 00:24:03,505
I got to hear about it later.
I went in search of him.

182
00:24:03,630 --> 00:24:09,501
I bought my engagement ring rahoillani
and Kos him.

183
00:24:13,432 --> 00:24:17,141
He did not want to know about me.
He ??said that it would be best not to -

184
00:24:17,272 --> 00:24:20,504
as if I do not have.

185
00:24:21,673 --> 00:24:24,586
Silloinko you...

186
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:27,705
Yes.

187
00:24:43,797 --> 00:24:46,152
Hi, Dad.

188
00:24:51,158 --> 00:24:57,554
I knew that something is going on.
Your daughter is here.

189
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:02,834
He came an hour ago. Surprise torque
is already over.

190
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:09,720
Päästitkö him inside just like that?
- I took him to the test first.

191
00:25:09,842 --> 00:25:13,073
When you were told about it?
- I do not want to talk about it.

192
00:25:13,202 --> 00:25:20,076
Is not it time already too late?
Go say hi, as is customary.

193
00:25:20,204 --> 00:25:24,641
I do not know anything about him.
- He is 11 years old and a social.

194
00:25:24,764 --> 00:25:31,159
She eats cake  terrible appetite.
- He can not come here to live.

195
00:25:31,285 --> 00:25:35,165
Oh, of course. You can change.

196
00:25:37,927 --> 00:25:42,877
Turn around. Go!

197
00:25:43,008 --> 00:25:46,205
Can you say hi?

198
00:25:46,328 --> 00:25:51,881
Just say hello. Can you?
She is your daughter.

199
00:25:59,931 --> 00:26:02,968
Good boy.

200
00:26:03,091 --> 00:26:09,406
He just came to you?
- I. I do not know what to do.

201
00:26:10,572 --> 00:26:16,843
Get a grip. You are 34 years of age
and ice cream bar at work.

202
00:26:16,974 --> 00:26:20,649
So are you.
- Yes, but I believe that I slowpoke.

203
00:26:20,774 --> 00:26:25,451
You had a vision.
- You do not have slowpoke.

204
00:26:25,575 --> 00:26:29,046
I wish you would not be so damn wrong.

205
00:26:29,176 --> 00:26:33,249
I tried different things when you were somewhere else.

206
00:26:33,376 --> 00:26:38,405
I divided leaves, and waste time.
I was in snow up to create this job.

207
00:26:38,977 --> 00:26:45,498
I tried the police hommaakin.
Sheriff just laughed at me.

208
00:26:45,619 --> 00:26:49,578
Did you want  policeman?
- It's not important.

209
00:26:49,699 --> 00:26:54,296
She is your daughter.
You have a right to be with him.

210
00:26:56,341 --> 00:26:58,696
Yeah, but it does not fit right now.

211
00:26:58,821 --> 00:27:02,451
You said yourself that it
Janet wants you to fail.

212
00:27:02,582 --> 00:27:07,577
Why do not you go home and try?

213
00:27:07,703 --> 00:27:12,060
Unless otherwise so because of me.

214
00:27:17,224 --> 00:27:19,375
Hi.

215
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:22,261
Hi.

216
00:27:22,385 --> 00:27:28,382
Where the father is gone?
- I try to ignore it.

217
00:27:28,506 --> 00:27:31,624
I guess he be puzzled.

218
00:27:32,667 --> 00:27:36,297
He will make their own affairs
and I will come.

219
00:27:37,348 --> 00:27:40,021
Do you understand, Grandma?

220
00:27:41,068 --> 00:27:47,225
Say Ruth. Sounds like an old grandmother.
- Ruth sounds like the old.

221
00:27:50,430 --> 00:27:53,343
I like you.

222
00:27:55,351 --> 00:27:57,581
Take a deep breath.

223
00:28:19,435 --> 00:28:22,473
Good night.

224
00:28:26,597 --> 00:28:29,555
Do you like this, shit?

225
00:28:29,677 --> 00:28:30,996
Damn .

226
00:28:36,918 --> 00:28:39,797
Good morning.

227
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:45,835
Good morning.
- Where were you last night?

228
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:52,399
I had to do.
- What?

229
00:28:54,361 --> 00:28:58,878
I went to see a friend.
- Nice.

230
00:29:00,122 --> 00:29:02,683
The mother knows that I'm here.

231
00:29:02,803 --> 00:29:07,161
I said that I want to 11 years after
weeks to be with you.

232
00:29:09,964 --> 00:29:14,356
Not you be in school?
- Today is Sunday.

233
00:29:15,925 --> 00:29:18,918
So it is.

234
00:29:20,846 --> 00:29:27,878
Since you're eleven
I guess you're the sixth?

235
00:29:28,007 --> 00:29:32,559
Seventh grade. I got a jump of more than one year
. I have a good reading head.

236
00:29:35,649 --> 00:29:40,166
Imagine that we ran into each other.
It was probably one of the brand.

237
00:29:40,290 --> 00:29:45,365
It was intended that we would meet.

238
00:29:46,411 --> 00:29:49,050
Maybe.

239
00:29:50,491 --> 00:29:56,249
Do you want coffee?
- I do not. It takes a night's sleep.

240
00:29:59,493 --> 00:30:05,842
I want to know everything about you.
How do you like? Stories of repairing?

241
00:30:05,974 --> 00:30:11,049
Not really. -Bowling?
Are you good at bowling?

242
00:30:11,175 --> 00:30:14,851
I'm pretty sure that I have not.

243
00:30:18,136 --> 00:30:22,528
Did you know that I play basketball?
I have game-developing.

244
00:30:22,657 --> 00:30:28,688
Yes then you're good.
- Yes. The team the best.

245
00:30:30,739 --> 00:30:35,017
It is to go to train.
Bye, Dad.

246
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:42,817
It's hard to get used to the idea of ??not being able to decide for themselves
of their day.

247
00:30:43,861 --> 00:30:46,534
Yes, you invented something.

248
00:30:48,182 --> 00:30:52,300
Thank you for having arranged for me
of this work.

249
00:30:53,743 --> 00:30:57,975
I wish I could do more.
It is indeed hope.

250
00:31:05,945 --> 00:31:09,335
It was a bad-ass workout.
I was really good tonight.

251
00:31:09,465 --> 00:31:15,063
I was really in great shape.
I just...

252
00:31:15,186 --> 00:31:18,736
Just visited  I feel sorry for the other girls.

253
00:31:20,067 --> 00:31:24,778
Do you want ice cream?
- I do not. I just wanted to come over.

254
00:31:24,908 --> 00:31:28,424
In order to explore each other.
- Boyd.

255
00:31:28,549 --> 00:31:31,017
Not now, not the cocktail hour.

256
00:31:31,149 --> 00:31:36,463
Complex deck is equipped with four new gum.
Go introduce yourself.

257
00:31:38,991 --> 00:31:42,825
Hello, sir? You are rich, do not you think?

258
00:31:42,951 --> 00:31:49,141
Meneehän I do pretty well.
- I understand. What car do you have?

259
00:31:49,272 --> 00:31:54,063
Champagne Camry.
- A rogue. How fast does it go?

260
00:31:54,193 --> 00:31:57,470
I have been driving it of 145.

261
00:31:57,594 --> 00:32:04,114
Fury. I wish my parents a
when I become a big one. Thank you.

262
00:32:04,235 --> 00:32:07,114
A nice kid.

263
00:32:36,321 --> 00:32:39,472
Will shit your pants?

264
00:32:52,444 --> 00:32:56,756
Hello.
- Where the hell are you?

265
00:32:56,884 --> 00:33:00,924
I have to do.
- Come on home.

266
00:33:01,045 --> 00:33:04,595
How old is the father in this picture?
- I am in a hurry.

267
00:33:04,726 --> 00:33:09,926
He talks incessantly.
- Is that, with a beard, father?

268
00:33:10,047 --> 00:33:14,326
Now you come home and immediately.
-10 Minutes.

269
00:33:54,175 --> 00:33:59,090
It would be easier if the sender's name would be
.

270
00:33:59,215 --> 00:34:03,255
I create the right

271
00:34:39,903 --> 00:34:44,534
Bring... a... morbid.

272
00:34:47,144 --> 00:34:53,015
What the hell is happening in the city?
- Do what we can, sir.

273
00:34:53,145 --> 00:34:57,185
It did not seem to be enough.
- I understand, sir.

274
00:34:57,306 --> 00:35:03,177
If you do not want help from elsewhere, and my
Ernien is a problem to solve.

275
00:35:03,307 --> 00:35:06,822
These two are scarcely
literate.

276
00:35:09,028 --> 00:35:12,908
You can not bind our feet and telling
run.

277
00:35:13,029 --> 00:35:18,023
Whether you purchase your badge and you will take
turpanne or shutting up.

278
00:35:23,430 --> 00:35:26,707
What a tableau.
- Tableau?

279
00:35:26,831 --> 00:35:32,782
Look at this from a broader perspective.
It is part of the package.

280
00:35:32,912 --> 00:35:38,033
The murderer used to abstract expressionism -

281
00:35:39,073 --> 00:35:45,627
and dadaa. It is a celebration of Marcel
Duchampsille.

282
00:35:46,955 --> 00:35:54,192
The bodies have been set
purely minimalist.

283
00:35:54,316 --> 00:35:57,467
As the waste container and wicker chair.

284
00:35:57,596 --> 00:36:02,512
Bath picture... imprisonment.

285
00:36:04,438 --> 00:36:07,475
I create the right.

286
00:36:09,439 --> 00:36:13,955
Penalty.
- The penalty of what?

287
00:36:24,321 --> 00:36:26,631
I do not know Ernie.

288
00:36:30,122 --> 00:36:34,435
Why smell eucalyptus tree?
- How does it taste like spaghetti?

289
00:36:34,563 --> 00:36:38,079
It's good. Thank you.
- Father Do you put food in you?

290
00:36:38,204 --> 00:36:42,356
Once I put the lasagna.
- It was pretty good.

291
00:36:42,484 --> 00:36:45,318
Ken, do not put me
lie twice.

292
00:36:47,045 --> 00:36:52,678
What do you like Green Oaks?
- Pretty nice, quiet time.

293
00:36:52,806 --> 00:36:56,561
We have an owl
festival a few weeks.

294
00:36:58,487 --> 00:37:02,925
And here is a murder took place.
- It is not spoken.

295
00:37:03,048 --> 00:37:06,837
He is a big girl. Are you 19?
-11.

296
00:37:06,969 --> 00:37:10,279
Do you know who wrote it?

297
00:37:10,409 --> 00:37:12,844
If panisimme all the clues in a bucket -

298
00:37:12,970 --> 00:37:17,920
and was pressed there,
you do not drown.

299
00:37:18,051 --> 00:37:21,600
But do not tell the mayor.

300
00:37:40,055 --> 00:37:42,615
Father?

301
00:37:42,735 --> 00:37:47,252
What are you doing?
- THINGS.

302
00:37:47,376 --> 00:37:52,610
In Clifton?
You came to get me home, do not you?

303
00:37:53,857 --> 00:37:57,009
That means I guess yes.

304
00:38:04,299 --> 00:38:10,011
What for are these?
- The floor gets wet when it rains.

305
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:14,214
They absorb the water.

306
00:38:14,341 --> 00:38:17,856
Your car smells like... That's OK.

307
00:38:18,901 --> 00:38:23,134
Good that you ride.
I have burned eight times the steering wheel.

308
00:38:23,262 --> 00:38:27,495
Calculator to play with. Let's go.

309
00:38:31,544 --> 00:38:36,903
What is this?
- Sundae. Do not you want it?

310
00:38:37,025 --> 00:38:40,734
Flavors to mix as much as possible.

311
00:38:40,865 --> 00:38:47,214
Cranberries, yogurt chips,
grated coconut, caramel sauce.

312
00:38:51,027 --> 00:38:54,384
It should have a good taste.

313
00:38:57,068 --> 00:39:00,664
Do you have a hyytelökäärmeitä?
- It is disgusting.

314
00:39:00,789 --> 00:39:06,069
Shame on you.
See what I bought from a service station.

315
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:07,782
TYYTTÄÄ ME I'M PASKIAlNEN!

316
00:39:07,910 --> 00:39:13,031
I know anyone that would be suitable.
- Me, too. It was the last.

317
00:39:17,952 --> 00:39:23,425
Do not look. There's a woman who stares at you
.

318
00:39:27,714 --> 00:39:34,871
Do not look. Go help him.
- Betsy allowed to go.

319
00:39:34,995 --> 00:39:42,346
Betsy, can you come?
I would ask the little flowers and the bees.

320
00:39:42,476 --> 00:39:45,708
Kenny, are you good...

321
00:39:46,557 --> 00:39:51,871
Hi. Ken, is not it?
Stephanie.

322
00:39:51,998 --> 00:39:56,595
Hi, Stephanie.
- Is she your daughter?

323
00:39:56,719 --> 00:40:01,236
Uh... Yeah. -Do you expect more and
paternity test results?

324
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:07,038
No, she is my daughter. Yeah.

325
00:40:07,961 --> 00:40:12,990
He adores you.
- Do you think so?

326
00:40:14,162 --> 00:40:19,283
Do you know what?
For my phone number -

327
00:40:19,403 --> 00:40:23,955
where I find it really good bananzaa.

328
00:40:26,644 --> 00:40:31,765
Yeah. Enter 2.90 as agreed.

329
00:40:32,925 --> 00:40:38,125
Really. The boss will be angry if
cash missing money.

330
00:40:48,928 --> 00:40:54,242
You like this, is not it?
- I never crossed it otherwise would order.

331
00:40:57,930 --> 00:41:00,398
Thank you.

332
00:41:02,891 --> 00:41:06,201
Hello ago.
- Bye.

333
00:41:13,972 --> 00:41:18,649
Well, wherever you are going to take him?
- I do not call him.

334
00:41:18,773 --> 00:41:23,484
That is what women like.
- I do not treffikunnossa.

335
00:41:23,614 --> 00:41:30,851
Get the  condition. Think about what the procedure
to talk about it then.

336
00:41:34,016 --> 00:41:39,091
By the way - Betsy
knows a lot about sex.

337
00:42:04,301 --> 00:42:08,739
Take a seat.
- I interrupting something?

338
00:42:08,862 --> 00:42:13,778
We now have a date.
You have to keep practicing.

339
00:42:14,823 --> 00:42:18,976
I do not know about you lot, its just that
you are not hard to talk about.

340
00:42:19,104 --> 00:42:23,417
It's all right, let him speak.
Women love to talk.

341
00:42:23,545 --> 00:42:26,423
You're listening to.

342
00:42:27,746 --> 00:42:31,136
I listen to? It is easy.

343
00:42:34,547 --> 00:42:38,939
You should ask you a question.
- I must, therefore, to talk about.

344
00:42:39,068 --> 00:42:44,222
To some extent, it would contribute.
- All right.

345
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:55,069
Do not think of anything?
- Give a little while.

346
00:42:59,351 --> 00:43:02,742
Okay, I'll start.

347
00:43:02,872 --> 00:43:06,751
Where did this come from?
- I do not want to talk about it.

348
00:43:06,872 --> 00:43:11,469
Fencing? Wrestling?
- Not quite.

349
00:43:12,674 --> 00:43:18,830
More fun than the scar on Harry Potter.
Flash - the time homoa.

350
00:43:24,036 --> 00:43:28,791
I would like the nickname koriksessa.

351
00:43:28,916 --> 00:43:32,114
Iceman, Admiral, The Postman.

352
00:43:32,237 --> 00:43:37,551
When you have a nickname, you know that
is transmitted. Amy is just silly.

353
00:43:37,678 --> 00:43:40,476
Georgina would be much nicer.

354
00:43:41,519 --> 00:43:46,548
I think Amy is a nice name.
- I had fun today.

355
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:50,593
Was it?
- It was. Let's do it again.

356
00:43:55,801 --> 00:44:00,717
Do you want me to cover up?
It is easy.

357
00:44:00,842 --> 00:44:05,553
According to the report, only 50% die in the year
.

358
00:44:18,765 --> 00:44:23,044
Who is now 11 years old?

359
00:44:27,727 --> 00:44:31,037
Sleep well.

360
00:44:38,089 --> 00:44:41,798
Open or closed?
- Open.

361
00:44:43,650 --> 00:44:47,325
Is this the way?
- It's a good one. Thank you.

362
00:44:50,451 --> 00:44:53,568
Do not ruin this, then.

363
00:45:00,173 --> 00:45:03,961
Soon his sofa is a hard thing going.

364
00:45:07,414 --> 00:45:11,169
I'll have a vegetable dish.

365
00:45:12,815 --> 00:45:17,765
curry goat and barbecue ribs.

366
00:45:21,576 --> 00:45:26,697
I have lived here for about 8 months.

367
00:45:26,817 --> 00:45:30,413
I wanted out of Cincinnati.

368
00:45:30,538 --> 00:45:34,851
Cincinnati?
- I was in London before that.

369
00:45:34,979 --> 00:45:38,130
I came to one with a friend here
and we got married.

370
00:45:38,259 --> 00:45:42,094
We did not know anything about each other.
I do not recommend.

371
00:45:43,660 --> 00:45:50,578
What do you like Green Oaks?
- To date, very nice.

372
00:45:50,702 --> 00:45:57,176
I am a travel agency at work.
It's quite boring.

373
00:45:57,303 --> 00:46:00,534
I do it because of cheap travel.

374
00:46:00,663 --> 00:46:06,853
I would like to visit England to meet with parents
... To suffer the humiliation.

375
00:46:14,946 --> 00:46:20,624
Do you like traveling?
- I do not know.

376
00:46:22,787 --> 00:46:29,978
I have not really ever traveled.
- How is that possible?

377
00:46:32,949 --> 00:46:37,626
I am, I was elsewhere.
- Elsewhere? In prison?

378
00:46:38,630 --> 00:46:42,465
In a way, .
Cotton Valley Hospital.

379
00:46:42,591 --> 00:46:49,304
Is it... Is not it ..?
- Yes, the place for crazy.

380
00:46:52,953 --> 00:46:58,073
I close my eyes and I will give you the possibility to leave the industry-
. I do not take offense.

381
00:47:00,994 --> 00:47:07,867
Ex-husband is a Harvard-trained pediatrician
.

382
00:47:09,275 --> 00:47:14,509
Alcoholic.
He ??filmed me when I slept, and betrayed all the time.

383
00:47:16,397 --> 00:47:18,433
I do not condemn anyone.

384
00:47:45,522 --> 00:47:50,233
I am amazed at the paintings
detail.

385
00:47:51,523 --> 00:47:55,119
I drew stick-opening time, and I wrote
stick figure.

386
00:47:55,244 --> 00:47:58,873
No one yet knew what it was.

387
00:47:59,004 --> 00:48:01,883
That's really incredible.

388
00:48:02,925 --> 00:48:05,837
So, it's nice.

389
00:48:07,526 --> 00:48:13,238
Who is it? A frustrated artist or a harsh critic of
?

390
00:48:13,367 --> 00:48:17,998
None. I will give art to the artists.

391
00:48:19,568 --> 00:48:22,002
None.

392
00:48:26,889 --> 00:48:30,849
So they forced me to buy this
.

393
00:48:37,051 --> 00:48:41,443
Is not it crazy?
- I've had a lot of fun. Thank you.

394
00:48:41,572 --> 00:48:45,167
I had a lot of fun.
- Good.

395
00:48:49,093 --> 00:48:52,973
Good night.
- I bought it for you.

396
00:48:53,094 --> 00:48:56,484
Wonderful. Thank you.

397
00:48:56,614 --> 00:49:01,325
Where might I...
Can you open the door?

398
00:49:03,736 --> 00:49:06,296
Take care of yourself.

399
00:49:08,056 --> 00:49:11,015
Hello ago.
- Bye.

400
00:49:35,261 --> 00:49:41,019
Kenny, what are you doing here?
- Hey, Sheriff. I draw a little -

401
00:49:41,142 --> 00:49:45,056
studied to determine the ideas.
- I understand.

402
00:49:46,103 --> 00:49:51,258
So, now is a lot going on.
Drawing is, therefore, help, huh?

403
00:49:52,504 --> 00:49:57,181
For me, it's chess.
Just that I think about it.

404
00:49:57,305 --> 00:50:00,821
For some reason, it relaxes me.

405
00:50:03,506 --> 00:50:06,863
See little of it.

406
00:50:12,388 --> 00:50:16,223
View now. I've heard that you are good at.

407
00:50:16,349 --> 00:50:19,739
Who said so?
- Your friend Irv.

408
00:50:19,869 --> 00:50:26,946
He's trying to arrange for you
the conclusion of the festival brochure.

409
00:50:27,070 --> 00:50:31,223
Really?
- Yes, yes.

410
00:50:31,351 --> 00:50:36,426
He has been pressing Glenia, but he is
and reportedly found someone.

411
00:50:36,552 --> 00:50:43,470
I've never seen so Irviä
enthusiasm. Would you like some gum?

412
00:50:45,314 --> 00:50:47,874
Yes.
- Please.

413
00:50:48,874 --> 00:50:52,868
Well, now I get to watch?

414
00:51:01,957 --> 00:51:05,313
Wait. Show.

415
00:51:05,437 --> 00:51:08,794
That's really beautiful.

416
00:51:10,078 --> 00:51:13,867
I told you that you...
- Do you think?

417
00:51:15,559 --> 00:51:18,950
You have an eye, son.

418
00:51:25,041 --> 00:51:28,875
Well, I leave you here to draw.

419
00:51:29,962 --> 00:51:32,351
Take care.

420
00:51:40,243 --> 00:51:45,796
I only see the tire marks in the clay.

421
00:51:45,924 --> 00:51:50,316
Should this be found in Jesus'
latent image?

422
00:51:50,445 --> 00:51:55,884
None. Those traces were found in
drive-in movie theater.

423
00:51:56,006 --> 00:52:01,718
They are Yokohama T4 rings avid.
Time conventional tires.

424
00:52:03,488 --> 00:52:09,086
How common?
- Gary has been selling a lot of them.

425
00:52:09,889 --> 00:52:13,165
Get a list of Garylta -

426
00:52:14,610 --> 00:52:17,727
and inspect all of the old
high school students.

427
00:52:17,850 --> 00:52:24,120
All the victims are from Green Oaks High.
Change the link we do not know.

428
00:52:26,852 --> 00:52:31,643
I offer that extra ball.

429
00:52:31,773 --> 00:52:37,485
A nice day.
- Irv, you are doing a favor?

430
00:52:37,614 --> 00:52:43,053
Tuuraatko me when I go to watch
Amy's workouts? Thank you.

431
00:52:45,895 --> 00:52:50,606
Here haiseejokin.
This is basketball.

432
00:52:50,736 --> 00:52:55,572
Does anyone know how to play?
Yes, it is lousy.

433
00:52:55,697 --> 00:53:00,010
I feel sick about this.
This is not valid.

434
00:53:00,138 --> 00:53:03,255
You should be more
class household -

435
00:53:03,378 --> 00:53:07,850
To learn to cook.
This is not good.

436
00:53:07,979 --> 00:53:13,259
There goes. A good.

437
00:53:13,380 --> 00:53:18,091
One more so faint.

438
00:53:18,221 --> 00:53:21,736
Move. A good.

439
00:53:25,982 --> 00:53:31,011
Good. I heard the voice network.

440
00:53:32,223 --> 00:53:35,375
Lets go now.

441
00:53:35,504 --> 00:53:38,974
I go outdoors. Play the.

442
00:53:39,105 --> 00:53:43,144
Do you want to be like Wheeler?
No, you do not want.

443
00:53:43,265 --> 00:53:47,259
Play the like
osaisitte play.

444
00:53:54,907 --> 00:53:59,618
Wheeler.
- Does this name-calling?

445
00:53:59,748 --> 00:54:06,143
I'm trying to figure out why you're
crowd even if you do not know how to play.

446
00:54:06,269 --> 00:54:11,390
Do you still uniform
players do.

447
00:54:11,510 --> 00:54:14,548
There will ring you virgins do.

448
00:54:14,671 --> 00:54:16,866
What did you say?

449
00:54:21,192 --> 00:54:23,865
Go get it.

450
00:54:37,795 --> 00:54:42,074
Hi.
Look at the next time someone in your size...

451
00:54:44,676 --> 00:54:47,237
Wow! Well done.

452
00:54:51,397 --> 00:54:56,597
I'm sorry.
Did not mean to laugh.

453
00:54:58,038 --> 00:55:03,193
It's all right, but it is difficult to
when I see it in the car next time.

454
00:55:03,319 --> 00:55:06,915
I refuse from driving.
It is because of the steering wheel.

455
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:12,274
Small false move and someone dies.
I would have too much power.

456
00:55:12,401 --> 00:55:16,873
I want it over so I can get.
- As a father you have all the power.

457
00:55:17,002 --> 00:55:20,517
It sounded like the world's worst
greeting cards.

458
00:55:20,642 --> 00:55:26,115
Girl, come visit the surplus warehouse.
You keep the damaged goods.

459
00:55:31,404 --> 00:55:33,919
Here we go.

460
00:55:39,846 --> 00:55:42,724
What a dick, right?

461
00:55:43,767 --> 00:55:47,760
Wanted something to Amy.

462
00:55:47,887 --> 00:55:52,598
What are ?
- Use your imagination.

463
00:56:04,890 --> 00:56:10,887
Are you ready?
- Tired. There was a heavy workout.

464
00:56:11,011 --> 00:56:18,010
I know... I know that you are bad.
I came there hakeakseni you.

465
00:56:18,973 --> 00:56:21,362
I saw it.

466
00:56:21,493 --> 00:56:24,566
Needed a coach eight
and there were eight.

467
00:56:24,694 --> 00:56:30,008
It's okay. Show what you know. No.

468
00:56:34,616 --> 00:56:37,847
I can teach you that if you want.

469
00:56:37,976 --> 00:56:42,334
You must be a balance.
Feet wider.

470
00:56:44,177 --> 00:56:50,731
Bend the knees.
Keep the ball in this hand, and them with this.

471
00:56:53,299 --> 00:56:55,176
Good.

472
00:56:56,259 --> 00:56:59,218
Look at me.

473
00:57:01,980 --> 00:57:07,499
Were you a school team?
- I do not really.

474
00:57:08,462 --> 00:57:12,137
You want to be mysterious, are not you?

475
00:57:12,262 --> 00:57:18,452
I do not huolittu team.
- The answer! After all has been difficult?

476
00:57:20,504 --> 00:57:23,177
You have to turn.

477
00:57:30,305 --> 00:57:33,423
It had a shorter distance.

478
00:57:37,627 --> 00:57:41,381
It's a terrible pun
I do not understand.

479
00:57:46,748 --> 00:57:51,140
Six yet so we have a
a baseball team.

480
00:57:51,269 --> 00:57:56,025
I'm sorry.
- In which year the books are?

481
00:58:02,431 --> 00:58:05,629
Are you going out?
- For a while.

482
00:58:05,752 --> 00:58:09,586
Where to?
- I have to carry a few things.

483
00:58:12,273 --> 00:58:19,225
We have a game on Thursday.
Come and see. Do you come from?

484
00:58:20,314 --> 00:58:25,867
Of course I will.
- Contact Stephanie that.

485
00:58:25,995 --> 00:58:29,068
You like him, do not you tykkääkin?
- Yeah.

486
00:58:29,196 --> 00:58:31,835
Even rogue.

487
00:58:33,157 --> 00:58:38,278
Okay, I'll call her.
- Good. I am then on the bench.

488
00:58:43,398 --> 00:58:47,677
Right. Good night.
- Good night.

489
00:59:24,246 --> 00:59:30,004
All were in the same crowd!
Look! B, -

490
00:59:30,127 --> 00:59:36,886
January and the U.S. map. Of these, only one of the remaining
here.

491
00:59:49,370 --> 00:59:54,161
Miller It... No, we are closed.

492
00:59:54,291 --> 00:59:57,967
We open at nine.
Nine!

493
01:00:01,212 --> 01:00:04,728
Damn. Son of a bitch!

494
01:00:10,774 --> 01:00:14,005
What crap is this?

495
01:00:20,576 --> 01:00:25,206
I've just cleaned this.
It's no use trying.

496
01:00:35,858 --> 01:00:41,217
I was a Special Forces soldier.
And I was a Navy Sealsissa.

497
01:00:42,259 --> 01:00:45,969
And I was in Gettysburg.

498
01:00:50,781 --> 01:00:53,614
What the hell?

499
01:00:54,662 --> 01:00:58,337
Kuteja I have left.

500
01:00:59,983 --> 01:01:02,178
Damn.

501
01:03:10,566 --> 01:03:17,439
Why is he not taken the body?
- Judging by the tire tracks -

502
01:03:17,567 --> 01:03:21,481
he became very busy.
He ??was suspended.

503
01:03:22,808 --> 01:03:25,447
He was frightened.

504
01:03:31,409 --> 01:03:34,402
I wonder if he ready now?

505
01:03:35,650 --> 01:03:37,846
Sir?

506
01:03:45,292 --> 01:03:47,965
Thank you, darling.

507
01:03:50,533 --> 01:03:55,244
Yesterday, while the deceased was found.
- Really?

508
01:03:56,974 --> 01:04:00,285
What has happened to your hand?

509
01:04:00,415 --> 01:04:04,772
I opened strösselilaatikkoa.
Knife slipped.

510
01:04:04,895 --> 01:04:11,290
You have a dangerous job.
You'd be more careful.

511
01:04:15,417 --> 01:04:20,173
And when it comes scar, your wrist must
a new friend.

512
01:04:26,739 --> 01:04:29,698
I have to go.

513
01:04:29,820 --> 01:04:34,576
Tire Tracks are the same as
drive-in theater visiting.

514
01:04:34,701 --> 01:04:39,981
Tyre Dealers  Gary said that Ken
bought one of those a month ago.

515
01:04:40,942 --> 01:04:46,381
Yes, the same tires, but it's still not enough
boy's arrest.

516
01:04:46,503 --> 01:04:51,897
He attended the same school.
- Was he a team?

517
01:04:52,024 --> 01:04:58,863
Can not we question him?
- Boyd is crazy, but it is not enough.

518
01:04:58,985 --> 01:05:05,459
If I reserve Ruth's son, and I'm
wrong, the administration ends.

519
01:05:06,666 --> 01:05:09,545
Hi. How are you?

520
01:05:10,587 --> 01:05:13,546
Hi. I am leaving for work.

521
01:05:13,668 --> 01:05:15,659
So...

522
01:05:29,390 --> 01:05:35,705
I'm going to buy cigarettes.
Will you come with me? -I have to learn fractions.

523
01:05:35,831 --> 01:05:39,507
I'll be back soon.

524
01:07:51,135 --> 01:07:53,775
Amy?

525
01:07:54,696 --> 01:07:58,690
Hi.
- What have you done?

526
01:08:00,017 --> 01:08:03,533
What are ?
- He is gone.

527
01:08:05,138 --> 01:08:09,849
I went outside and when I came back to
he was gone.

528
01:08:14,820 --> 01:08:17,653
I told you that please do not mess it up.

529
01:08:44,665 --> 01:08:49,660
Amy...
- Not to come to nothing.

530
01:08:53,627 --> 01:08:57,506
It would amuse me to say that what...
- Do not tell me then!

531
01:09:01,868 --> 01:09:07,466
Now you know why I did not give you
to meet with him. She is a slowpoke.

532
01:09:49,196 --> 01:09:52,030
Son of a bitch!

533
01:09:52,157 --> 01:09:57,437
It has been continued for three days.
Come on, you're almost on time.

534
01:09:57,558 --> 01:10:01,837
I know what is going on, but
obey the speed limit.

535
01:10:02,879 --> 01:10:05,029
Tyyttää me I am son of a bitch

536
01:10:12,801 --> 01:10:16,794
Do you stay for the evening to work? Do not you go to any of Amy's matsiin
?

537
01:10:16,921 --> 01:10:21,393
I do not. He is gone.

538
01:10:21,522 --> 01:10:26,472
Do? Where to?
- I do not know.

539
01:10:26,603 --> 01:10:30,643
Do not you have not called him?
Why do not you?

540
01:10:31,684 --> 01:10:34,437
I just do not .

541
01:10:35,925 --> 01:10:39,122
The same. I do not have a father.

542
01:10:39,245 --> 01:10:44,718
Everything was better in the past.
I told him not to have to come.

543
01:10:44,846 --> 01:10:47,520
Just the same...

544
01:10:58,969 --> 01:11:02,723
Do not I get an extra ball?
- Not today.

545
01:11:08,050 --> 01:11:12,010
Hi, I'm here. Stephanie.

546
01:11:12,131 --> 01:11:15,329
I called just to ask you all right.

547
01:11:15,452 --> 01:11:21,050
Is, we had to go and see
Amy's match in the evening.

548
01:11:22,093 --> 01:11:25,847
Call, or...

549
01:11:31,935 --> 01:11:36,611
Lets go if you do not want to lose!
- Enter!

550
01:11:43,217 --> 01:11:46,607
Back to defend!

551
01:11:48,017 --> 01:11:54,857
Go ahead, Fraserman.
You are jackal. Not hard. Get in here.

552
01:11:54,979 --> 01:11:59,177
Wheeler, airport.
- Why, it is funny you are.

553
01:11:59,299 --> 01:12:04,420
6 seconds left and we are leading.
Do you have what I want to see the mokaa.

554
01:12:27,024 --> 01:12:29,380
Fury.

555
01:13:15,033 --> 01:13:20,108
What are you doing here?
- Nice to see you too.

556
01:13:21,154 --> 01:13:23,748
What do you want?

557
01:13:25,035 --> 01:13:31,794
I just came to ask why you did not come at all.

558
01:13:32,916 --> 01:13:36,626
I had to be at work.
- Do not you have to call?

559
01:13:40,037 --> 01:13:43,030
Not that anything would come.

560
01:13:46,798 --> 01:13:52,396
I do not understand.
, We have had fun together.

561
01:14:30,686 --> 01:14:34,282
... A series of murders is
stimulated discussion.

562
01:14:34,407 --> 01:14:37,843
Is a small green Oaks killing of four
.

563
01:14:37,968 --> 01:14:42,484
Kenneth Boyd, 34, city resident, was arrested last night,
-

564
01:14:42,608 --> 01:14:46,887
four others on suspicion of murder by city-
.

565
01:14:47,009 --> 01:14:50,161
The police said they are premeditated
executions.

566
01:14:50,290 --> 01:14:55,649
A weapon was an ax, knife macheteja
. Boyd was a while ago-

567
01:14:55,771 --> 01:14:59,081
treatment which he had received from
because of depression.

568
01:14:59,211 --> 01:15:02,488
The victims have been identified
Marty Prichard, Wade Hutchinson-

569
01:15:02,612 --> 01:15:08,245
Lyle Bagwell and Brett Miller.
All local business people.

570
01:15:14,174 --> 01:15:20,444
I have to admit that I was hoping it
that you would not be you.

571
01:15:20,575 --> 01:15:24,410
Open this contraption.
The red button and play.

572
01:15:28,616 --> 01:15:33,816
I'm sorry that I went to your room,
but these drawings...

573
01:15:33,937 --> 01:15:38,250
They are really beautiful.

574
01:15:38,378 --> 01:15:40,574
See them.

575
01:15:42,739 --> 01:15:46,176
Although the time for a sick way.

576
01:15:47,500 --> 01:15:53,531
You will be stayed for some of these tracks
crime locations.

577
01:15:54,541 --> 01:15:58,615
That's how they make the tires...
Leave their mark.

578
01:16:01,382 --> 01:16:06,935
It took some time before we realized
how did you join the whole matter.

579
01:16:07,063 --> 01:16:12,821
Who is so hard to hate a team that
he would kill the players later on?

580
01:16:15,985 --> 01:16:20,741
I went to the mayor's speeches, and...
Do you take gum?

581
01:16:22,626 --> 01:16:27,382
We were talking about the festival...

582
01:16:28,427 --> 01:16:33,821
Then it came to my mind.
Who would be the motive? Who?

583
01:16:35,468 --> 01:16:37,778
Who?

584
01:16:39,629 --> 01:16:41,665
Hello? Who?

585
01:16:43,830 --> 01:16:46,060
That's right.

586
01:16:49,511 --> 01:16:51,547
Pöllöllä.

587
01:17:10,635 --> 01:17:14,389
Irv, I'm sorry your friend's why.

588
01:17:14,515 --> 01:17:19,636
Tuit him and he was a disappointment to you
. Is it so strange?

589
01:17:19,756 --> 01:17:24,273
If you have tunaroinut whole life
eventually everything will go towards the pine.

590
01:17:25,317 --> 01:17:30,472
Well. See the little Fooger-people.

591
01:17:59,283 --> 01:18:02,993
Hi, Amy.
- Hey, Irv.

592
01:18:03,124 --> 01:18:09,360
Is it possible to talk about the father?
- Now?

593
01:18:09,485 --> 01:18:14,002
You know him. Perhaps you could help me understand the
.

594
01:18:15,046 --> 01:18:18,244
Yeah. Come inside.

595
01:18:23,527 --> 01:18:27,646
Did you go to greet the father
often when he was there?

596
01:18:27,768 --> 01:18:33,401
I did not go. Please sit down.

597
01:18:33,529 --> 01:18:36,681
Why did not you?

598
01:18:40,170 --> 01:18:45,484
I wanted
, but it was difficult.

599
01:18:45,611 --> 01:18:50,766
I did not want to see him in such a condition
.

600
01:18:53,813 --> 01:18:57,328
Why is he hated them
basketball players?

601
01:19:00,574 --> 01:19:03,806
He wanted to get on the team.

602
01:19:04,855 --> 01:19:10,214
It was a hard blow when she could not get by
. He became the mascot.

603
01:19:10,336 --> 01:19:15,365
A little while he thought he was one of them
.

604
01:19:15,497 --> 01:19:19,570
But the gang bastards do not
have seen things so.

605
01:19:24,618 --> 01:19:30,569
It just got worse and got worse until...

606
01:19:32,420 --> 01:19:36,379
They thought it could make him a
just about anything.

607
01:19:36,500 --> 01:19:40,779
Then he did it
comic book in which he described them idiots.

608
01:19:40,901 --> 01:19:45,498
After all, they were accustomed
royal treatment.

609
01:19:45,622 --> 01:19:50,094
Then the whole school laughed them.

610
01:19:58,384 --> 01:20:01,377
One night  -

611
01:20:02,625 --> 01:20:05,264
they decided to take revenge on him.

612
01:20:06,626 --> 01:20:09,379
What did they do?

613
01:20:13,827 --> 01:20:17,616
Do you want water? I'll get.

614
01:20:22,429 --> 01:20:26,945
I do not think he is not recognized?
- No.

615
01:20:28,470 --> 01:20:31,826
Do not deny he did not know.

616
01:20:32,870 --> 01:20:36,181
He just sat there.

617
01:20:38,631 --> 01:20:42,102
I would have thought that
he could do any harm to someone.

618
01:20:46,593 --> 01:20:50,872
It's hard to imagine what those guys did to him
.

619
01:20:50,994 --> 01:20:54,270
What does it then it was
that was bothering me.

620
01:21:01,395 --> 01:21:06,550
It seems hard now when I'm
son arrested for murder.

621
01:21:06,676 --> 01:21:13,151
But I hope that we will, over time,
get it behind us.

622
01:21:14,878 --> 01:21:17,312
I do not think so.

623
01:21:25,440 --> 01:21:29,992
Can I take that one beer?
- Take off.

624
01:21:35,722 --> 01:21:39,397
I'm going to drink and go.
Do not tell the police.

625
01:21:41,443 --> 01:21:45,959
Amy did it for me.
Is not that damn cute?

626
01:21:54,165 --> 01:22:00,002
I wish I were as creative. It would probably damn
at ease.

627
01:22:06,607 --> 01:22:10,044
This.
- Thank you.

628
01:22:17,369 --> 01:22:22,524
What was that? -My cat.
It does not want to be locked up.

629
01:22:22,650 --> 01:22:25,801
Do you have a cat? What breed is?

630
01:22:25,930 --> 01:22:31,881
I do not know, a normal cat.
Are the many?

631
01:22:32,011 --> 01:22:37,564
After all, they are at least 40 races.
- I did not know.

632
01:22:37,693 --> 01:22:43,086
These were really great, Kenny.
Who would not like mail?

633
01:22:44,414 --> 01:22:50,570
They scared the shit your pants.
Do you know what I like in particular?

634
01:22:52,215 --> 01:22:55,891
I am a monster.
It was scary.

635
01:22:56,016 --> 01:22:58,849
Good job.
- Thank you.

636
01:23:02,697 --> 01:23:08,011
What are you doing here, Kenny?
Do us a message now.

637
01:23:08,138 --> 01:23:12,576
It was the Son of Sam,
or something like that.

638
01:23:22,260 --> 01:23:25,856
It was good water. Thank you.

639
01:23:26,901 --> 01:23:32,977
You still want something?
- Cat does not seem to be fine.

640
01:23:33,102 --> 01:23:36,652
Do I get to go and see it?
- You do not. It is a jumpy.

641
01:23:36,783 --> 01:23:40,663
That's why I veinkin the room.
- I'll get along well with cats.

642
01:23:40,784 --> 01:23:45,813
I prefer not. -Why not?
- I'm a bit overprotective.

643
01:23:45,945 --> 01:23:50,223
I would be kind to it.
- Not now, Amy.

644
01:23:50,345 --> 01:23:53,975
Looks like a cat sounds sick.
- Well, it can be.

645
01:23:54,106 --> 01:23:59,056
Is not that a boy cat?
- Stop it already!

646
01:24:02,147 --> 01:24:07,586
Amy, it is best that you go home.

647
01:24:07,708 --> 01:24:10,746
Okay, I'm leaving. Sorry.

648
01:24:11,349 --> 01:24:13,989
It is the best.

649
01:24:20,351 --> 01:24:23,104
Goodbye, Amy.

650
01:24:33,433 --> 01:24:40,272
I've watched the screen.
The drawings do not speak against you, quite the opposite.

651
01:24:40,394 --> 01:24:43,512
You unpack yourself through them.

652
01:24:43,635 --> 01:24:47,310
You kill them in the picture, so that it
need to do really.

653
01:24:47,435 --> 01:24:50,792
Shitty hated them and wanted them to die.

654
01:24:50,916 --> 01:24:55,911
You might even
did you go to crime scenes.

655
01:24:56,037 --> 01:24:59,394
Maybe you wanted to convince
to yourself that you could do that.

656
01:25:00,758 --> 01:25:04,228
You are an artist, you're a murderer.

657
01:25:04,358 --> 01:25:08,238
You can only do harm to yourself.

658
01:26:12,010 --> 01:26:17,483
Son, Now this is starting to become really interesting to
.

659
01:26:20,452 --> 01:26:24,890
You kill a few guys on paper
and so these guys are dying.

660
01:26:25,013 --> 01:26:30,566
If you do not have the date, it was a
a hated them equal.

661
01:26:30,694 --> 01:26:37,294
Who could be the punishment of the need for a
?

662
01:26:38,895 --> 01:26:43,572
One sick...  Sick as...

663
01:26:46,497 --> 01:26:51,777
What is your friend Irv
has been up to lately?

664
01:27:26,104 --> 01:27:28,413
By little. Shut up.

665
01:27:37,866 --> 01:27:42,178
Your father gave his all, and they wanted to destroy him
.

666
01:27:42,306 --> 01:27:46,585
Took his soul, his
ruined my life. I could have prevented it.

667
01:27:46,707 --> 01:27:50,144
You make me ill!
- I had to do something.

668
01:27:50,268 --> 01:27:53,944
Let me go!
- Would you just tell.

669
01:28:06,431 --> 01:28:13,065
It's over now. Is that clear?
Take it easy.

670
01:28:19,513 --> 01:28:22,870
I've never been in the past
kill anyone.

671
01:28:22,994 --> 01:28:26,748
When I killed Prichard was a good feeling.

672
01:28:26,874 --> 01:28:31,471
When I killed Wade Hutchinson
was damn awesome feeling.

673
01:28:34,276 --> 01:28:39,590
Anger grew, and each pig killed
after living only improved.

674
01:28:47,278 --> 01:28:50,271
Ken could not have done it.

675
01:28:50,399 --> 01:28:54,187
He could not
do what should have been done.

676
01:29:06,321 --> 01:29:10,793
Took care of the five friends.
Why Fooger?

677
01:29:11,842 --> 01:29:14,755
The bed again Ken.

678
01:29:16,163 --> 01:29:18,803
I did not want to do it again.

679
01:29:20,484 --> 01:29:23,521
Evil must be punished.

680
01:29:25,645 --> 01:29:28,717
You are quite a friend.

681
01:29:29,766 --> 01:29:32,758
But you should have
shoddy police.

682
01:30:01,731 --> 01:30:06,886
I wanted to actually kill them.
- Yeah, but you did not kill.

683
01:30:07,012 --> 01:30:11,404
Damned if people wish to kill the bastards -

684
01:30:12,453 --> 01:30:15,844
we all were sitting in a life.

685
01:30:28,056 --> 01:30:34,929
I have to ask this. Why did you want to take the cause of niskoillesi
?

686
01:30:40,098 --> 01:30:44,092
I do not know what part I have
in this world.

687
01:30:45,139 --> 01:30:48,928
Being locked up seems a lot easier.

688
01:30:51,260 --> 01:30:56,289
If you have not understood the purpose for
you are more stupid than I thought.

689
01:31:05,662 --> 01:31:09,941
Can I help you?
- I came to pick my daughter.

690
01:31:10,063 --> 01:31:13,977
Amy!
- Ken, what are you doing here?

691
01:31:14,104 --> 01:31:17,381
Hello, huvittaako come to us?
- Yeah!

692
01:31:17,505 --> 01:31:20,019
Get your stuff.

693
01:31:20,145 --> 01:31:26,016
You can not just be about him.
-11 Years. Now it is my turn.

694
01:31:32,827 --> 01:31:35,137
How's it going? Well?

695
01:31:39,268 --> 01:31:42,625
This is for you.
- What is it?

696
01:31:42,749 --> 01:31:46,948
Just a little thing.
- A puppy?

697
01:31:55,511 --> 01:31:57,742
SAVIOUR

698
01:31:57,872 --> 01:32:03,391
It has all the best nickname.
Thank you, Dad.

699
01:32:35,238 --> 01:32:37,799
I apologize.

700
01:32:39,719 --> 01:32:46,796
I apologize for the story.
I am truly sorry.

701
01:32:53,042 --> 01:32:56,637
Oh, and I am not guilty.

702
01:33:17,166 --> 01:33:20,602
Nervous weekend.
Who else?

703
01:33:20,726 --> 01:33:25,926
Owl Festival, and we can play a bit
. How throws go?

704
01:33:26,047 --> 01:33:30,360
Time, but poorly in Osu plate.

705
01:33:30,488 --> 01:33:35,005
The mother, Amy came.
- No shit, Ken.

706
01:34:37,380 --> 01:34:40,411
