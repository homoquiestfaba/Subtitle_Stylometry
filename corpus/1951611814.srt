1
00:00:23,402 --> 00:00:25,104
As many of you know,

2
00:00:25,104 --> 00:00:27,504
the past few months of my life
have been very difficult.

3
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:30,270
I don't know how I would have gotten
through it without all of you.

4
00:00:30,309 --> 00:00:33,801
I really think it's a testament
of the love in this institution

5
00:00:33,846 --> 00:00:35,245
that I stand before you today

6
00:00:35,281 --> 00:00:37,272
as the first straight-C student
in school history

7
00:00:37,316 --> 00:00:38,943
to be voted
valedictorian.

8
00:00:38,985 --> 00:00:41,886
While I may not have
excelled in the classroom,

9
00:00:41,921 --> 00:00:44,219
I think that
my recent experiences

10
00:00:44,256 --> 00:00:46,053
in that bigger schoolhouse
we call life

11
00:00:46,092 --> 00:00:49,960
has taught me a few lessons I'd like
to share with my fellow graduates:

12
00:00:49,996 --> 00:00:51,827
Follow your heart
and don't question it,

13
00:00:51,864 --> 00:00:54,025
no matter where
it tells you to go.

14
00:00:54,066 --> 00:00:58,025
Trust me, it'll open up a world of new
experiences you can't even imagine.

15
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:01,198
I bet you're wondering what
a straight-C student is doing

16
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:03,367
giving
a valedictorian speech.

17
00:01:03,409 --> 00:01:05,274
It wasn't easy,
believe me.

18
00:01:05,311 --> 00:01:07,677
But with desire, focus

19
00:01:07,713 --> 00:01:10,477
and the willingness to treat
any obstacle as an opportunity,

20
00:01:10,516 --> 00:01:12,313
it's amazing what
you can accomplish.

21
00:01:17,456 --> 00:01:20,050
See, I was blessed
with a terrific mom...

22
00:01:20,092 --> 00:01:23,653
not only is she a lush,
but she also hates me.

23
00:01:24,864 --> 00:01:26,491
A couple of days
before my birthday,

24
00:01:26,532 --> 00:01:29,228
I overhear her ordering me
a male stripper.

25
00:01:29,268 --> 00:01:30,496
Nothing says
"I love you"

26
00:01:30,536 --> 00:01:32,663
like 10" of man meat
popping out of a cake.

27
00:01:32,705 --> 00:01:34,696
And knowing
dear old Mom,

28
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:36,469
she'll try and nail him
after the party,

29
00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:39,171
but not before she tends
to more important business

30
00:01:39,211 --> 00:01:42,408
with her new best friend
Jelena Mariskova Flachsman,

31
00:01:42,448 --> 00:01:45,849
the imported trophy wife
of our family lawyer Irv Flachsman.

32
00:01:46,919 --> 00:01:50,047
Peggy told me
you found a new masseur.

33
00:01:50,089 --> 00:01:53,354
- I hear he's...
- You heard right.

34
00:01:55,628 --> 00:01:58,062
So can I have
his number?

35
00:01:58,097 --> 00:02:01,089
Ahem...
we'll see.

36
00:02:11,811 --> 00:02:13,802
That guy next
to Flachsman...

37
00:02:13,846 --> 00:02:15,814
our neighbor
Mike Rudell...

38
00:02:15,848 --> 00:02:17,975
big-shot TV producer
and the guy my mom screws

39
00:02:18,017 --> 00:02:19,575
whenever the batteries
run out.

40
00:02:19,618 --> 00:02:22,246
I'm totally addicted
to his new show.

41
00:02:22,288 --> 00:02:25,189
Welcome to
"Absolutely Positive,"

42
00:02:25,224 --> 00:02:28,091
the show where we give couples
who are about to get married

43
00:02:28,127 --> 00:02:30,687
one last chance
to make sure they're...

44
00:02:30,729 --> 00:02:33,664
- Absolutely positive!
- That's right!

45
00:02:46,278 --> 00:02:48,371
See, I just don't
understand people

46
00:02:48,414 --> 00:02:50,678
who live their lives
as one big routine.

47
00:02:50,716 --> 00:02:52,206
They're basically saying,

48
00:02:52,251 --> 00:02:54,845
"I'm not worthy of a unique
experience on this earth."

49
00:02:54,887 --> 00:02:57,014
Well, sorry,
but I am.

50
00:02:57,056 --> 00:02:59,581
What the hell is going on?
I told you to wait!

51
00:02:59,625 --> 00:03:02,287
For God's sake,
she's not even here, you moron!

52
00:03:09,101 --> 00:03:10,432
Shake it, baby!

53
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:27,210
My mother moved out
to LA from Ohio

54
00:03:27,253 --> 00:03:29,619
when she was 20
to become an actress.

55
00:03:29,655 --> 00:03:32,317
After a few years, she got knocked up
by a sleezeball producer

56
00:03:32,358 --> 00:03:35,293
who told her she couldn't be on his show
unless she hoovered me out.

57
00:03:35,327 --> 00:03:38,421
Mom was no genius,
but she was smart enough

58
00:03:38,464 --> 00:03:40,830
to realize that
18 years of child support

59
00:03:40,866 --> 00:03:43,232
was better than a couple of weeks
on his dumb show,

60
00:03:43,269 --> 00:03:45,169
so I got to
stick around.

61
00:03:45,204 --> 00:03:47,832
What Mom didn't count on
was the prick having a heart attack

62
00:03:47,873 --> 00:03:49,500
and croaking
a year after I was born.

63
00:03:52,378 --> 00:03:55,779
Look at me...
see what a happy baby I was?

64
00:03:55,814 --> 00:03:58,806
That's because I wasn't old enough
to understand why she had me.

65
00:04:01,887 --> 00:04:04,048
Here's me
on my first day of school.

66
00:04:04,089 --> 00:04:05,750
Why am I smiling?

67
00:04:05,791 --> 00:04:07,486
Because I got to spend
seven hours a day

68
00:04:07,526 --> 00:04:10,518
with adults who didn't reek
of menthols and cheap Scotch.

69
00:04:14,567 --> 00:04:16,558
That's me at my friend
Kayla's house.

70
00:04:16,602 --> 00:04:19,002
There weren't
any sleepovers at my house.

71
00:04:19,038 --> 00:04:21,632
I couldn't risk it after one
of the scumbags Mom brought home

72
00:04:21,674 --> 00:04:25,007
tried to feel me up
after she passed out.

73
00:04:25,044 --> 00:04:27,274
Kayla's dad
took this one, too.

74
00:04:27,313 --> 00:04:29,577
Mom was sucking off
her producer to get an audition

75
00:04:29,615 --> 00:04:31,480
for some lame show
called "Bikini Cove."

76
00:04:31,517 --> 00:04:33,815
Got there late
and missed the whole thing.

77
00:04:39,225 --> 00:04:40,988
Anyway, as far
as my graduation,

78
00:04:41,026 --> 00:04:43,256
this time she had a great excuse
for missing it.

79
00:04:43,295 --> 00:04:45,991
Mini! Mini!

80
00:04:50,102 --> 00:04:53,003
When I call you,
I expect you to answer.

81
00:04:53,038 --> 00:04:54,938
Sorry.

82
00:04:54,974 --> 00:04:57,204
Don't patronize me.

83
00:04:57,243 --> 00:05:00,076
- Sorry.
- If you're trying to get me to call you

84
00:05:00,112 --> 00:05:02,512
a spoiled little ungrateful bitch,
you're outta luck.

85
00:05:02,548 --> 00:05:04,539
I won't give you
the satisfaction.

86
00:05:05,584 --> 00:05:07,609
Thanks, Mommy.

87
00:05:07,653 --> 00:05:10,281
I'm going out
and I need you to wait here

88
00:05:10,322 --> 00:05:12,347
for a delivery
from the liquor store.

89
00:05:12,391 --> 00:05:14,188
He should be here
by 7:00.

90
00:05:14,226 --> 00:05:16,558
Fine.

91
00:05:16,595 --> 00:05:18,620
Hmm.

92
00:05:20,799 --> 00:05:23,290
You should know that skirt
makes your thighs look fat.

93
00:05:25,037 --> 00:05:26,937
Gosh, you're right, Mom.

94
00:05:26,972 --> 00:05:28,837
I'm such a cow.

95
00:05:28,874 --> 00:05:32,901
Honey, if I don't
tell you these things,

96
00:05:32,945 --> 00:05:34,640
who will?

97
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:37,012
- Okay. Thanks.
- You're welcome.

98
00:05:37,049 --> 00:05:38,914
It's funny how
my fat thighs

99
00:05:38,951 --> 00:05:41,647
never seemed to bother
what's-his-name from the liquor store.

100
00:05:41,687 --> 00:05:44,815
Hey, Mini.
How're you doing?

101
00:05:51,463 --> 00:05:55,194
So Mom spent the next 12 years trying
to bag another elephant.

102
00:05:55,234 --> 00:05:58,067
Then five years ago,
she met Martin.

103
00:05:58,103 --> 00:06:00,867
He's a partner
at a public relation's firm,

104
00:06:00,906 --> 00:06:02,874
which is ironic
because I can't remember

105
00:06:02,908 --> 00:06:04,967
the last time they were seen
in public together,

106
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:06,739
or had relations.

107
00:06:08,414 --> 00:06:10,541
You're home early.

108
00:06:11,884 --> 00:06:13,818
Yeah, um...

109
00:06:13,852 --> 00:06:16,650
client canceled
our dinner.

110
00:06:16,689 --> 00:06:18,714
Protecting all those poor,
defenseless oil companies

111
00:06:18,757 --> 00:06:20,315
from those big bad
environmentalists?

112
00:06:20,359 --> 00:06:23,328
Well, somebody's gotta make
the payments on your Beamer.

113
00:06:23,362 --> 00:06:25,227
Is your mother home?

114
00:06:25,264 --> 00:06:27,494
No, she went to some party
off Beachwood.

115
00:06:27,533 --> 00:06:29,501
She was in one
of her happy moods,

116
00:06:29,535 --> 00:06:31,469
so I doubt
she'll be sleeping here,

117
00:06:31,503 --> 00:06:34,336
in case you were thinking
of inviting a guest over.

118
00:06:36,775 --> 00:06:39,141
I wasn't, but thanks
for your concern.

119
00:06:39,178 --> 00:06:41,112
You're going out
on a school night?

120
00:06:41,146 --> 00:06:43,774
Yeah.

121
00:06:43,816 --> 00:06:45,647
Hmm.

122
00:06:45,684 --> 00:06:47,481
Have you finished
your homework?

123
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:49,680
I haven't even
cracked a book.

124
00:06:50,956 --> 00:06:52,617
To understand me,

125
00:06:52,658 --> 00:06:55,126
you need to understand that life,
in my opinion,

126
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:57,253
is all about
new experiences.

127
00:06:57,296 --> 00:06:59,025
"Firsts" is what
I call them.

128
00:06:59,064 --> 00:07:01,225
And the goal of life...
any life...

129
00:07:01,266 --> 00:07:03,826
should be to cram
as many firsts into it as possible.

130
00:07:03,869 --> 00:07:06,667
After popping out of the cake,
I knew I had to top it,

131
00:07:06,705 --> 00:07:08,696
but it was tough...

132
00:07:08,741 --> 00:07:11,505
skydiving,
bungee jumping?

133
00:07:11,543 --> 00:07:14,808
Please. It's more dangerous getting
on the freeway every day.

134
00:07:16,582 --> 00:07:19,574
Then one night while cruising through
Hollywood, it hit me.

135
00:07:19,618 --> 00:07:22,678
So I went to an escort service just
to see what would happen.

136
00:07:22,721 --> 00:07:24,985
When they found out
how young I was,

137
00:07:25,023 --> 00:07:27,617
they told me they had
a trick for me that night.

138
00:07:27,659 --> 00:07:31,095
My first night as a call girl
was a serious letdown.

139
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:33,621
The guy said I looked
so much like his niece,

140
00:07:33,665 --> 00:07:36,463
he just started whimpering
and praying for forgiveness.

141
00:07:48,747 --> 00:07:51,238
Honey, what are you
doing here?

142
00:07:51,283 --> 00:07:54,275
Did you have fun
tonight, honey?

143
00:07:55,687 --> 00:07:58,212
For my first night
turning tricks,

144
00:07:58,257 --> 00:07:59,918
it could have
been better.

145
00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:02,256
That's nice.

146
00:08:02,294 --> 00:08:04,387
That's so nice.

147
00:08:14,106 --> 00:08:16,074
Nice, Mom.

148
00:08:16,108 --> 00:08:18,042
In my bed.

149
00:08:23,782 --> 00:08:26,307
After that night,
I told the escort service,

150
00:08:26,351 --> 00:08:28,478
"No more clients
with a conscience."

151
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,647
They were happy to oblige
with a last-minute gig

152
00:08:30,689 --> 00:08:33,123
at a corporate fuckpad
an executive keeps.

153
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:38,556
They said I was
just his type... young.

154
00:08:42,534 --> 00:08:44,001
It's open.

155
00:08:52,411 --> 00:08:55,209
Hello?

156
00:08:55,247 --> 00:08:57,010
Can you fucking believe it?

157
00:08:59,985 --> 00:09:02,351
Uh, hi.

158
00:09:03,989 --> 00:09:05,889
Sorry I'm late.

159
00:09:05,924 --> 00:09:08,256
It's okay.

160
00:09:08,293 --> 00:09:10,921
Mind if I freshen up?

161
00:09:10,963 --> 00:09:13,090
No, go right ahead.

162
00:09:16,168 --> 00:09:17,931
My own stepdad?

163
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:20,404
My first thought was
"How sick is he?"

164
00:09:20,439 --> 00:09:23,306
But then I started thinking,
"I'm one to talk,

165
00:09:23,342 --> 00:09:25,139
and well, why not?

166
00:09:25,177 --> 00:09:26,906
I mean, he isn't
my real dad,

167
00:09:26,945 --> 00:09:28,776
and talk about
a first."

168
00:09:28,814 --> 00:09:32,841
Then I thought, "If my mom can do
some strange guy in my bed,

169
00:09:32,885 --> 00:09:34,978
I can do her strange guy
in this bed."

170
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:36,749
You doing okay
in there?

171
00:09:36,788 --> 00:09:40,383
Just peachy.

172
00:09:40,425 --> 00:09:43,986
Listen, sugar, would you mind
turning the lights off?

173
00:09:44,029 --> 00:09:46,190
See, I'm kinda new to all this
and a little shy.

174
00:09:46,231 --> 00:09:47,858
No problem,

175
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:51,063
but do you think maybe
we could get this show on the road?

176
00:10:05,217 --> 00:10:07,117
Now close your eyes.

177
00:10:08,654 --> 00:10:10,246
Come on.

178
00:10:12,291 --> 00:10:15,226
You won't
keep them shut for long.

179
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:19,955
Just don't look around.

180
00:10:19,998 --> 00:10:22,592
Now, close your eyes.

181
00:10:46,024 --> 00:10:48,993
I literally couldn't feel
the ground under my feet...

182
00:10:49,027 --> 00:10:51,154
a first
to top all firsts.

183
00:10:51,196 --> 00:10:54,097
I knew I'd tell him one day,
but I wanted to savor it for a while.

184
00:10:54,132 --> 00:10:56,828
Hey, you forgot
your keys.

185
00:10:56,868 --> 00:11:00,269
Oh well, here's to
immediate gratification.

186
00:11:09,748 --> 00:11:11,045
You were great.

187
00:11:12,784 --> 00:11:15,412
What?

188
00:11:22,894 --> 00:11:24,759
Oh...

189
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:24,384
Suddenly, he was
coming home every night

190
00:12:24,423 --> 00:12:27,119
and even started asking me
about my homework.

191
00:12:28,193 --> 00:12:30,161
How're you doin',
kiddo?

192
00:12:30,195 --> 00:12:32,322
How are you making out
with those math problems?

193
00:12:32,364 --> 00:12:36,494
'Cause, you know, if you ever need
any help, I could... you know.

194
00:12:36,535 --> 00:12:40,904
Actually, I was thinking about starting
a 401K plan at work.

195
00:12:40,939 --> 00:12:43,203
Could you help me pick
a good mutual fund?

196
00:12:50,048 --> 00:12:52,141
All you did
was kiss?

197
00:12:52,184 --> 00:12:53,947
Yeah, you don't
believe me?

198
00:12:53,985 --> 00:12:55,316
No, of course,
I believe you.

199
00:12:55,353 --> 00:12:56,980
Yo, Kayla,
I got some more

200
00:12:57,022 --> 00:13:00,185
of what you were looking
for last Saturday night.

201
00:13:00,225 --> 00:13:02,056
Aw, yeah yeah.

202
00:13:03,729 --> 00:13:05,822
Actually, Troy,
I think you confused her

203
00:13:05,864 --> 00:13:08,162
with that senile, toothless
grandmother of yours.

204
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,794
Come on, man.

205
00:13:10,836 --> 00:13:12,497
Yo, Mini,

206
00:13:12,537 --> 00:13:14,835
why don't you use that mouth
for something useful

207
00:13:14,873 --> 00:13:16,841
and suck my dick?

208
00:13:16,875 --> 00:13:18,308
Aw, yeah!

209
00:13:18,343 --> 00:13:19,867
All right.

210
00:13:20,946 --> 00:13:23,005
Hey!
What the fu...

211
00:13:23,048 --> 00:13:25,482
Let me suck your dick, Troy.
You said I could.

212
00:13:25,517 --> 00:13:28,213
- Yo, this ain't funny!
- Come on, baby, take it out!

213
00:13:31,256 --> 00:13:33,019
I'm on my knees, Troy,
come on!

214
00:13:33,058 --> 00:13:35,151
Jesus Christ, Mini!
What the fuck?

215
00:13:35,193 --> 00:13:36,353
God damn, Mini!

216
00:13:36,394 --> 00:13:38,555
Wait, I almost had it.
I almost had it.

217
00:13:38,597 --> 00:13:40,258
Here it comes!

218
00:13:42,801 --> 00:13:45,065
What's wrong,
stage fright?

219
00:13:49,941 --> 00:13:51,431
Thank you.

220
00:14:18,336 --> 00:14:20,361
I want you to know

221
00:14:20,405 --> 00:14:22,066
that I feel horrible.

222
00:14:23,575 --> 00:14:27,238
And not about what happened,
because that was an accident.

223
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:29,577
But I just keep thinking

224
00:14:29,614 --> 00:14:32,742
I didn't know that
you were doing that.

225
00:14:32,784 --> 00:14:36,015
And I just wonder how
things might have been

226
00:14:36,054 --> 00:14:38,022
if you...

227
00:14:38,056 --> 00:14:40,650
had a real father.

228
00:14:43,161 --> 00:14:45,095
So what are
you saying, Martin?

229
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:47,462
You wanna be
my father now?

230
00:14:54,573 --> 00:14:56,370
To be perfectly honest,

231
00:14:56,408 --> 00:14:58,467
I loved it.
Talk about electric.

232
00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:00,535
Knowing that any moment
she could walk in

233
00:15:00,579 --> 00:15:02,274
was better
than any drug.

234
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:32,267
Mom thought it was cute
how we'd suddenly grown so close,

235
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:36,872
and thought it was wonderful how Martin
had taken an interest in my education.

236
00:15:45,557 --> 00:15:48,720
Mini? Mini?

237
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,785
What, you don't know
how to knock?

238
00:15:50,829 --> 00:15:52,319
Have you seen Martin?

239
00:15:52,364 --> 00:15:54,229
No, I can't say
that I have.

240
00:15:54,266 --> 00:15:57,861
He was in his study,
but I haven't been able to find him.

241
00:15:57,903 --> 00:16:01,498
I assume he's gone out, so I've invited
Ricardo over for a cocktail,

242
00:16:01,539 --> 00:16:03,632
and you know how
children make him feel very uneasy.

243
00:16:03,675 --> 00:16:05,575
So I would really
appreciate it

244
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:09,137
if you and your friend
would stay in here

245
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:11,876
or use the backdoor
when he arrives.

246
00:16:11,917 --> 00:16:15,409
Okay, not a problem.

247
00:16:15,453 --> 00:16:17,478
Good.

248
00:16:33,405 --> 00:16:35,373
Oh my God!

249
00:16:41,079 --> 00:16:43,479
Now that we were
spending time together,

250
00:16:43,515 --> 00:16:46,484
I actually started to find out
what Martin was like for the first time.

251
00:16:53,358 --> 00:16:55,417
He wasn't the drip
I thought he was.

252
00:16:56,962 --> 00:16:58,953
He was funny...

253
00:17:00,065 --> 00:17:02,158
charming...

254
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,031
sweet...

255
00:17:04,069 --> 00:17:06,037
and even a little shy.

256
00:17:09,874 --> 00:17:13,469
Looking back, that may have been
the moment he fell in love.

257
00:17:23,154 --> 00:17:25,782
This went on
for about two months

258
00:17:25,824 --> 00:17:28,054
before we had the talk
we both knew was coming.

259
00:17:43,074 --> 00:17:45,372
So...

260
00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:47,401
So...

261
00:17:53,518 --> 00:17:56,078
I don't want to sneak around
in my own house.

262
00:17:56,121 --> 00:17:58,282
Well, I don't think
telling her is such a hot idea.

263
00:17:58,323 --> 00:18:00,951
I don't even want to live
under the same roof with her anymore.

264
00:18:00,992 --> 00:18:03,085
You can't leave.
She'll get half.

265
00:18:06,865 --> 00:18:10,028
Can I ask how the hell
you married her without a prenup?

266
00:18:10,068 --> 00:18:13,526
She wasn't as bad
of an actress as you think.

267
00:18:18,376 --> 00:18:20,571
Well, there is
another option.

268
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:26,811
And what's that?

269
00:18:26,851 --> 00:18:29,843
Lt'll take some planning,
some resolve.

270
00:18:34,492 --> 00:18:37,393
- You wanna kill her?
- Yeah.

271
00:18:39,297 --> 00:18:42,061
No! Of course not,
she's my mother.

272
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:44,591
Good, I'm glad
to hear you say that.

273
00:18:46,905 --> 00:18:48,770
But I was thinking...

274
00:18:48,807 --> 00:18:51,173
if she suddenly got ill...

275
00:18:51,209 --> 00:18:53,734
- III?
...unstable...

276
00:18:53,778 --> 00:18:56,178
unpredictable...

277
00:18:56,214 --> 00:18:58,375
irrational...

278
00:18:58,416 --> 00:19:02,079
dangerous, and the safety
of her husband...

279
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:04,611
her child...?

280
00:19:04,656 --> 00:19:06,521
She'd have to be
sent someplace

281
00:19:06,558 --> 00:19:08,958
where they could give her
the care she needs.

282
00:19:10,061 --> 00:19:12,586
Yeah.

283
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:15,622
And it would be
for her own good.

284
00:19:15,667 --> 00:19:17,430
Yeah.

285
00:19:17,469 --> 00:19:21,599
As painful as it would be to be away
from my loving wife.

286
00:19:21,639 --> 00:19:24,335
Well, you did it for the well-being
of your daughter...

287
00:19:24,375 --> 00:19:27,606
the selfless act
of a devoted parent.

288
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:36,218
We'll find her a very comfortable place
out in the country.

289
00:19:37,589 --> 00:19:39,113
With lots
of fresh air.

290
00:19:39,157 --> 00:19:42,183
It'll be a much
better life for her.

291
00:19:42,227 --> 00:19:44,752
So much better.

292
00:19:56,374 --> 00:20:00,140
I awoke the next morning
as excited as I could remember.

293
00:20:01,513 --> 00:20:03,743
Unlike most firsts
which are over too quickly,

294
00:20:03,781 --> 00:20:06,375
this would take
determination...

295
00:20:07,519 --> 00:20:09,714
stamina...

296
00:20:11,022 --> 00:20:13,183
and imagination.

297
00:20:15,093 --> 00:20:17,493
I decided
to start simply.

298
00:20:19,063 --> 00:20:22,226
The school nurse, a lush
named Helga Hauptfuhrer...

299
00:20:22,267 --> 00:20:24,792
or "Der Führer," as she was
affectionately known...

300
00:20:24,836 --> 00:20:27,464
starts jonesing
for her afternoon nip

301
00:20:27,505 --> 00:20:29,996
about 45 minutes
after lunch each day...

302
00:20:32,177 --> 00:20:34,873
which leaves me free to help
myself to the candy store.

303
00:20:40,118 --> 00:20:42,848
Slipping her the pills
was absurdly easy,

304
00:20:42,887 --> 00:20:46,050
because for Mom,
every morning was Margaritaville

305
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:48,251
and I was
her bartender.

306
00:20:56,167 --> 00:20:58,658
It was even easier
when the sun went down.

307
00:20:58,703 --> 00:21:00,432
Mini, Diane,
I'm home.

308
00:21:00,471 --> 00:21:03,463
I turned her nightcap
into an all-nightcap.

309
00:21:03,508 --> 00:21:05,237
And after three days
of this,

310
00:21:05,276 --> 00:21:07,073
the fireworks were
about to begin.

311
00:21:07,111 --> 00:21:09,306
Peggy from Hays, Kansas.

312
00:21:10,715 --> 00:21:12,410
Phase one:

313
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:15,283
Violent mood swings-
slash-uncontrollable rages.

314
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:17,049
God damn it.

315
00:21:17,088 --> 00:21:19,022
Damn it! God damn it!

316
00:21:19,057 --> 00:21:22,493
Where are they?
I'm gonna be late!

317
00:21:22,527 --> 00:21:24,051
Fucking shit!

318
00:21:24,095 --> 00:21:26,655
Where the fuck are they?

319
00:21:26,698 --> 00:21:30,862
It took me three weeks
to get the appointment with Fabrizio!

320
00:21:30,902 --> 00:21:34,804
Fabrizio Santano:
Masseuse to the stars

321
00:21:34,839 --> 00:21:37,808
and reported possessor
of one of the biggest schlongs in town.

322
00:21:37,842 --> 00:21:39,707
Rumor has it
he's pourin' the pork

323
00:21:39,744 --> 00:21:42,508
to every rich wife
between Malibu and Pasadena.

324
00:21:42,547 --> 00:21:44,447
Now I'm gonna miss it

325
00:21:44,482 --> 00:21:46,916
because I can't find
my fucking keys!

326
00:21:48,253 --> 00:21:50,653
I could use
a little help over here!

327
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:59,087
Diane, do you remember
where you left your keys

328
00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:01,030
when you came home
last night?

329
00:22:01,065 --> 00:22:05,195
Oh yeah, I put them
in the fucking bowl

330
00:22:05,236 --> 00:22:08,637
next to the fucking door
like I always fucking do.

331
00:22:11,142 --> 00:22:13,406
Well, you were kind of
out of it last night.

332
00:22:16,648 --> 00:22:18,809
I was not.

333
00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:22,411
I had one drink
with Peggy... one!

334
00:22:22,453 --> 00:22:24,250
Are you sure
about that?

335
00:22:24,289 --> 00:22:27,156
- Yes, I'm sure.
- 'Cause you seemed a little bit too...

336
00:22:29,694 --> 00:22:31,958
Dickless wonder.

337
00:22:32,964 --> 00:22:34,864
Mini, I'm taking
your car.

338
00:22:34,899 --> 00:22:37,197
Martin, you drive her
to school.

339
00:22:37,235 --> 00:22:40,363
- I've got a meeting with Chapman.
- Tell him it's an emergency.

340
00:22:40,405 --> 00:22:43,203
- He's one of our biggest clients!
- Who gives a fuck?

341
00:22:47,812 --> 00:22:50,440
You're not a dickless wonder.

342
00:22:51,482 --> 00:22:53,109
Thank you.

343
00:23:00,358 --> 00:23:03,020
- Hello, Fabrizio?
- Yes, what is it?

344
00:23:03,061 --> 00:23:04,995
It's Diane.

345
00:23:05,029 --> 00:23:07,088
Diane Spechtenstein?

346
00:23:07,131 --> 00:23:09,793
- Tannen.
- Oh, I'll be seeing you shortly, no?

347
00:23:09,834 --> 00:23:12,200
Listen, I'm going to have to
cancel our appointment.

348
00:23:12,236 --> 00:23:14,363
Aw, something come up?

349
00:23:14,405 --> 00:23:16,669
Yeah, something came up.

350
00:23:25,616 --> 00:23:27,311
Oh, that's so good.

351
00:23:31,756 --> 00:23:34,350
- Fabrizio.
- Ms. Tannen?

352
00:23:34,392 --> 00:23:37,850
- Jelena?
- Diane, what are you doing here?

353
00:23:37,895 --> 00:23:40,921
- What the hell are you doing here?
- Easy now, Ms. Tannen.

354
00:23:40,965 --> 00:23:43,866
You called.
You canceled 30 minutes ago.

355
00:23:43,901 --> 00:23:45,892
I did not call
and cancel, Fabrizio!

356
00:23:45,937 --> 00:23:49,100
I talked to you myself.
You said something come up.

357
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:51,335
You knew I had
an appointment today.

358
00:23:51,376 --> 00:23:53,003
Did you call
and pretend to be me?

359
00:23:53,044 --> 00:23:56,878
Are you drunk?
How could I possibly sound like you?

360
00:23:56,914 --> 00:23:58,609
Yeah, that's true.

361
00:23:58,649 --> 00:24:00,241
Five minutes,
Ms. Tannen.

362
00:24:00,284 --> 00:24:01,546
Bitch.

363
00:24:01,586 --> 00:24:04,487
Ms. Tannen,
wait in the recovery room.

364
00:24:04,522 --> 00:24:06,717
Fabrizio, I never need
the recovery room, you know that.

365
00:24:06,758 --> 00:24:08,521
Did I tell you
to stop?

366
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:11,119
What part of "Don't stop"
didn't you understand?

367
00:24:11,162 --> 00:24:13,926
- Five minutes.
- But this is my appointment!

368
00:24:13,965 --> 00:24:15,933
Fabrizio, get off of her
right now!

369
00:24:15,967 --> 00:24:18,902
I've got him
for 55 more minutes!

370
00:24:18,936 --> 00:24:22,872
- Wait your turn!
- It's my turn! It's my appointment!

371
00:24:22,907 --> 00:24:25,102
Look, if you're not
going to wait outside,

372
00:24:25,143 --> 00:24:26,872
at least shut
your goddamn mouth

373
00:24:26,911 --> 00:24:29,209
and let me
enjoy this!

374
00:24:29,247 --> 00:24:31,681
- Get off of her!
- Don't you fucking talk to me!

375
00:24:31,716 --> 00:24:33,581
- Right now!
- Throw her out!

376
00:24:33,618 --> 00:24:36,143
- Faster!
- Get off!

377
00:24:36,187 --> 00:24:38,849
Don't or I'll have immigration
up your ass!

378
00:24:38,890 --> 00:24:42,121
You sneaky little bitch!

379
00:24:48,766 --> 00:24:50,859
Do you think
she'll press charges?

380
00:24:50,902 --> 00:24:54,065
Are you fucking kidding me?
She should get 20 to life.

381
00:24:54,105 --> 00:24:57,541
When I told Peggy and Margo
about the stunt she pulled,

382
00:24:57,575 --> 00:25:00,100
both of them said they would have
ripped her eyes out.

383
00:25:00,144 --> 00:25:03,910
She'll be lucky
if anybody talks to her again.

384
00:25:03,948 --> 00:25:06,246
Here comes
the choo-choo.

385
00:25:06,284 --> 00:25:09,981
For God's sake,
I didn't break both hands!

386
00:25:11,956 --> 00:25:15,289
God, I still can't
believe you broke your hand on her face.

387
00:25:15,326 --> 00:25:17,794
That's so Linda Hamilton.

388
00:25:17,829 --> 00:25:20,491
I hope she enjoys shitting
out the teeth she swallowed.

389
00:25:40,685 --> 00:25:42,653
Phase two:

390
00:25:42,687 --> 00:25:45,952
Wild shopping sprees carried
out in a euphoric state.

391
00:25:47,859 --> 00:25:49,986
Divine Productions,
Carlos speaking.

392
00:25:50,027 --> 00:25:52,052
Hello, Carlos.
It's Diane Tannen calling.

393
00:25:52,096 --> 00:25:54,564
Señora Tannen.

394
00:25:54,599 --> 00:25:57,432
Listen, I'm going to need
a delivery to the house.

395
00:26:01,239 --> 00:26:04,208
Hey, where do you
want these?

396
00:26:04,242 --> 00:26:06,301
I don't know.
My mom ordered them.

397
00:26:06,344 --> 00:26:08,141
The eucalyptus pods
and bamboo and...

398
00:26:08,179 --> 00:26:12,138
The giraffe can
clean its own ears with its tongue

399
00:26:12,183 --> 00:26:16,176
because the tongue is approximately 21"
long. Is that true or false?

400
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:18,154
Carlos?! What...?

401
00:26:19,290 --> 00:26:21,986
What the fuck is
going on, Carlos?

402
00:26:22,026 --> 00:26:25,393
Oh, Señora Tannen, it's the stuff
you ordered for the party yesterday.

403
00:26:25,429 --> 00:26:27,158
Ordered? I didn't
order anything!

404
00:26:27,198 --> 00:26:29,098
What the fuck are you
talking about?

405
00:26:29,133 --> 00:26:31,067
- Are you invited?
- I don't think it's a party.

406
00:26:31,102 --> 00:26:33,570
I think they're having
a family event...

407
00:26:33,604 --> 00:26:36,835
a dysfunctional circus.

408
00:26:36,874 --> 00:26:38,535
Mom, look at
the monkey.

409
00:26:38,576 --> 00:26:41,340
You did. You called me
yesterday on the phone. We talked.

410
00:26:41,379 --> 00:26:43,347
I didn't call you!
I did not!

411
00:26:43,381 --> 00:26:45,611
You were talking about
a party on the phone.

412
00:26:45,650 --> 00:26:47,914
Right after you washed
your painkillers...

413
00:26:47,952 --> 00:26:49,852
- Shh!
- Right.

414
00:26:49,887 --> 00:26:51,855
- I didn't...
- You said you wanted...

415
00:26:51,889 --> 00:26:54,050
...organize a party, Carlos!
- Shangri-la,

416
00:26:54,091 --> 00:26:56,651
- that's what you said to me.
- Shangri-la, oh yeah.

417
00:26:56,694 --> 00:26:58,924
One, two, three.

418
00:26:58,963 --> 00:27:00,760
I'm coming, I'm coming!

419
00:27:00,798 --> 00:27:02,891
And you're not gonna be
helping me ever again,

420
00:27:02,934 --> 00:27:04,526
because you know what?
You suck.

421
00:27:07,071 --> 00:27:08,663
Oh shit!

422
00:27:11,142 --> 00:27:14,373
What the fuck is
going on here, Carlos?

423
00:27:14,412 --> 00:27:16,403
Who ordered
all this stuff?

424
00:27:16,447 --> 00:27:18,005
I didn't order it.

425
00:27:18,049 --> 00:27:20,142
I wouldn't do anything
without your permission,

426
00:27:20,184 --> 00:27:22,152
but Mrs...
Señora Tannen...

427
00:27:22,186 --> 00:27:24,916
Martin, l...

428
00:27:24,956 --> 00:27:27,652
Diane...

429
00:27:28,793 --> 00:27:30,988
did you order
all this stuff?

430
00:27:31,028 --> 00:27:33,087
No, I didn't.

431
00:27:33,130 --> 00:27:35,530
I didn't order anything.

432
00:27:35,566 --> 00:27:37,329
Come inside with me,
Diane, because...

433
00:27:37,368 --> 00:27:38,767
- come inside.
- I didn't order anything!

434
00:27:38,803 --> 00:27:40,737
Over the next few days,

435
00:27:40,771 --> 00:27:43,865
whenever Mom passed out
from too much drinky-drinky,

436
00:27:43,908 --> 00:27:46,342
I'd pull out her wallet
and reach out and touch someone.

437
00:27:46,377 --> 00:27:49,278
After a week of my version
of the Home Shopping Network,

438
00:27:49,313 --> 00:27:51,508
the doorbell might as well
have been a cannon.

439
00:27:56,621 --> 00:27:59,522
Oh God.

440
00:28:04,462 --> 00:28:07,363
Mini! Jesus Christ,

441
00:28:07,398 --> 00:28:09,127
I asked for that drink
10 minutes ago.

442
00:28:09,166 --> 00:28:10,997
Put it here.

443
00:28:11,035 --> 00:28:12,696
Help me.

444
00:28:12,737 --> 00:28:14,432
You're welcome.

445
00:28:14,472 --> 00:28:17,270
Jesus Christ.

446
00:28:21,078 --> 00:28:22,978
Anything else
I can do for you?

447
00:28:23,014 --> 00:28:24,709
Mm...

448
00:28:26,017 --> 00:28:28,645
Sweetie, that is yummy.

449
00:28:28,686 --> 00:28:30,654
What's in it?

450
00:28:39,363 --> 00:28:41,092
Phase three:

451
00:28:41,132 --> 00:28:44,067
Rambling
incoherent monologues in public.

452
00:28:44,101 --> 00:28:46,695
I just clammed up, you know,
It was just weird.

453
00:28:46,737 --> 00:28:48,864
You know, eventually
I just said to him,

454
00:28:48,906 --> 00:28:51,568
"Sorry, Fabrizio, but it's just not
a safe haven anymore."

455
00:28:51,609 --> 00:28:52,974
She has ruined it
for all of us.

456
00:28:53,010 --> 00:28:57,140
Oh boy, oh boy.
You know...

457
00:28:57,181 --> 00:28:59,877
- You know I love you!
- She looks so lovely, doesn't she?

458
00:28:59,917 --> 00:29:03,614
She looks lovely, but I'm gonna take out
a restraining order. I got news for you.

459
00:29:03,654 --> 00:29:05,986
What happened...
yeah, I heard about that incident.

460
00:29:06,023 --> 00:29:07,957
Here she comes.

461
00:29:07,992 --> 00:29:11,450
Jelena, my God,
your dentist is a genius.

462
00:29:11,495 --> 00:29:13,520
I'd never know those
weren't your real teeth.

463
00:29:13,564 --> 00:29:15,532
You stay the hell
away from me, you psycho,

464
00:29:15,566 --> 00:29:17,557
- You're lucky I didn't...
- I'm lucky? No no no no.

465
00:29:17,601 --> 00:29:20,195
Let me tell you something:
Fabrizio will not return my calls

466
00:29:20,237 --> 00:29:22,205
because of you,
you fucking bitch!

467
00:29:22,239 --> 00:29:24,833
Let me tell you something:
That shit may fly in Siberia,

468
00:29:24,875 --> 00:29:27,275
but it does not fly
on Mulholland, you got it?!

469
00:29:27,311 --> 00:29:30,212
- She hit my wife.
- Really?

470
00:29:30,247 --> 00:29:31,714
Like I said,
get some help!

471
00:29:31,749 --> 00:29:33,011
Yeah well,
whatever.

472
00:29:33,050 --> 00:29:36,349
She's fucking
unbelievable!

473
00:29:36,387 --> 00:29:38,548
I'm telling you,
the best thing I ever did

474
00:29:38,589 --> 00:29:40,420
was break my hand
on that bitch's face.

475
00:29:40,458 --> 00:29:42,653
- Yeah.
- I think she's troubled, you know?

476
00:29:42,693 --> 00:29:45,389
She has a beautiful nose.
I love her nose.

477
00:29:45,429 --> 00:29:47,761
I feel fucking fantastic!

478
00:29:47,798 --> 00:29:49,732
Like, I feel like
I could run a marathon,

479
00:29:49,767 --> 00:29:52,361
- you know what I mean?
...each and every juror in the eye.

480
00:29:52,403 --> 00:29:54,132
Juries!

481
00:29:54,171 --> 00:29:57,106
Can I please come over
and talk to you about juries?

482
00:29:57,141 --> 00:30:00,577
I've always wanted to say
the words, "You're guilty!"

483
00:30:00,611 --> 00:30:03,876
What do you guys think happens in those
sequestered situations?

484
00:30:03,914 --> 00:30:07,008
Do you think they have sex, the jurors?
I think they really get it on.

485
00:30:07,051 --> 00:30:09,849
Are you looking
at my tits?

486
00:30:09,887 --> 00:30:11,855
You crazy fuck!

487
00:30:11,889 --> 00:30:13,288
Oh, you know,
I was an actress.

488
00:30:13,324 --> 00:30:15,053
I don't know if you
know that about me.

489
00:30:15,092 --> 00:30:17,583
I almost had this role
on "Bikini Cove."

490
00:30:17,628 --> 00:30:20,791
I almost had two lines.
My one line would have been this:

491
00:30:20,831 --> 00:30:23,322
"Um, I'll have another
sex on the beach."

492
00:30:23,367 --> 00:30:24,732
Mmm.

493
00:30:24,769 --> 00:30:27,602
That show was a really
fucking fantastic show.

494
00:30:27,638 --> 00:30:30,368
It was very creative.
Cheesy drink, but it's a drink anyway.

495
00:30:30,407 --> 00:30:33,274
I like Scotch.
Isn't that fun?

496
00:30:33,310 --> 00:30:36,473
I had to suck off the executive producer
for that audition,

497
00:30:36,514 --> 00:30:38,038
but, hey, I almost got
my SAG card,

498
00:30:38,082 --> 00:30:39,743
- so I felt it was worth it.
- I need a refill.

499
00:30:39,784 --> 00:30:41,945
- Yeah, me too. If you'll excuse us...
- But we were talking

500
00:30:41,986 --> 00:30:44,716
- about juries and sex on the...
- Excuse me.

501
00:30:44,755 --> 00:30:47,087
You know, hey hey hey,
cock breath!

502
00:30:47,124 --> 00:30:49,285
Oh my God.

503
00:30:51,962 --> 00:30:54,123
Listen, good job,
but I need more warning.

504
00:30:54,165 --> 00:30:55,723
I was at dinner
with Chapman.

505
00:30:55,766 --> 00:30:57,097
I can't
reschedule again.

506
00:30:57,134 --> 00:30:58,795
I know, but it was
a golden opportunity.

507
00:30:58,836 --> 00:31:00,804
You always said
you can't pay enough

508
00:31:00,838 --> 00:31:02,362
for good publicity, right?

509
00:31:02,406 --> 00:31:04,966
What the hell?
Can you control her, sir?

510
00:31:05,009 --> 00:31:08,672
Ooh!
Bye, everybody!

511
00:31:10,247 --> 00:31:12,579
I'll see you later!

512
00:31:12,616 --> 00:31:15,016
At this point with
all those witnesses,

513
00:31:15,052 --> 00:31:17,850
Martin thought we could get a shrink
to have her sent away.

514
00:31:17,888 --> 00:31:19,856
My feeling was
that until they were ready

515
00:31:19,890 --> 00:31:21,949
to weld the door
to her padded cell shut,

516
00:31:21,992 --> 00:31:23,983
there was still
more work to be done.

517
00:31:25,663 --> 00:31:27,130
Fabrizio,
it's Diane.

518
00:31:27,164 --> 00:31:29,325
Hi...

519
00:31:29,366 --> 00:31:32,563
Do you think you could call me?
I've called you a few times.

520
00:31:32,603 --> 00:31:34,571
I just...
I need to talk to you.

521
00:31:34,605 --> 00:31:36,368
Ciao.

522
00:31:39,376 --> 00:31:41,810
- Feel okay?
- Yeah, great.

523
00:31:41,846 --> 00:31:43,711
I'll be right back
with your two iced teas.

524
00:31:43,747 --> 00:31:46,375
So was there any reason
why we couldn't just meet at my house?

525
00:31:46,417 --> 00:31:49,614
Honestly, because I want
some witnesses around

526
00:31:49,653 --> 00:31:51,314
in case you fucking
lose it again.

527
00:31:51,355 --> 00:31:53,084
In case l...

528
00:31:53,123 --> 00:31:54,522
you're unbelievable,
Jelena.

529
00:31:54,558 --> 00:31:55,820
For God's sake,
get a grip.

530
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:58,192
All the shit you've
been talking about me

531
00:31:58,229 --> 00:32:00,561
to Peggy, Barbara,
and Trish has to stop!

532
00:32:04,802 --> 00:32:06,531
After your performance
the other night,

533
00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:09,198
I can't believe I'm even
giving you a warning.

534
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:11,140
- Ha! A warning?
- If you keep this up,

535
00:32:11,175 --> 00:32:14,201
- I will make my husband...
- Your husband? Oh right!

536
00:32:14,245 --> 00:32:15,974
- Give me a break!
...and mental anguish!

537
00:32:16,013 --> 00:32:17,173
Are we clear?

538
00:32:19,283 --> 00:32:21,046
I'm, like, "Dude,
all I wanted was..."

539
00:32:21,085 --> 00:32:23,076
Hey, boys.

540
00:32:26,156 --> 00:32:27,646
Wanna have a little fun?

541
00:32:27,691 --> 00:32:30,057
- You are losing it.
- That's so funny, you know?

542
00:32:33,197 --> 00:32:34,824
Final phase:

543
00:32:34,865 --> 00:32:37,231
Complete
psychotic breakdown.

544
00:32:40,738 --> 00:32:43,206
- Hello?
- Diane.

545
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:46,437
Fabrizio, is that you?
How are you?

546
00:32:46,477 --> 00:32:48,911
I can see you.
Can you see me?

547
00:32:48,946 --> 00:32:50,573
Who is this?

548
00:32:50,614 --> 00:32:52,172
Do you feel safe?

549
00:32:53,584 --> 00:32:54,881
This isn't funny.
I'm hanging up.

550
00:32:54,919 --> 00:32:56,580
Hang up
and you're dead.

551
00:32:56,620 --> 00:33:00,215
- Is this a joke?
- I assure you I'm no joke.

552
00:33:00,257 --> 00:33:04,455
By the way, that pink scarf
is very fetching.

553
00:33:04,495 --> 00:33:06,690
Who is this?
Just...

554
00:33:08,132 --> 00:33:09,759
Take it easy!

555
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,768
- Get away from me!
- What the hell is your problem?

556
00:33:11,802 --> 00:33:14,168
Leave me alone!
Leave me alone!

557
00:33:14,204 --> 00:33:17,298
Maybe you should make a run for that
silver Jag you drive home

558
00:33:17,341 --> 00:33:19,172
to Mira Loma Lane.

559
00:33:19,209 --> 00:33:21,439
- How do you know where I live?
- I know everything.

560
00:33:21,478 --> 00:33:22,536
What do you
want from me?

561
00:33:22,579 --> 00:33:23,807
- Ma'am?
- What?

562
00:33:23,847 --> 00:33:25,872
I'm gonna have to ask you
to leave the mall.

563
00:33:25,916 --> 00:33:28,680
I-I can't leave.
He's...

564
00:33:30,054 --> 00:33:31,612
He knows where I live.
I can't.

565
00:33:31,655 --> 00:33:33,213
Who knows, ma'am?

566
00:33:33,257 --> 00:33:36,749
This man has been
terrorizing me on the phone.

567
00:33:38,462 --> 00:33:40,453
He's... hello?

568
00:33:40,497 --> 00:33:42,431
Yeah, this is Franklin.
We've got a code seven.

569
00:33:42,466 --> 00:33:44,297
- You've gotta come with me.
- Don't touch!

570
00:33:44,335 --> 00:33:46,633
- Ma'am?
- Don't you dare touch me!

571
00:33:49,273 --> 00:33:51,400
Settle down.

572
00:33:57,381 --> 00:33:58,712
Hey, get off of her!

573
00:34:01,185 --> 00:34:02,675
The other arm!

574
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,915
Get the cuffs on her!

575
00:34:04,955 --> 00:34:06,422
Come on, ma'am!

576
00:34:11,161 --> 00:34:13,493
After her performance
at the mall,

577
00:34:13,530 --> 00:34:16,658
I'm sure she would have qualified as
committable, but that wasn't enough.

578
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:19,464
I wanted her to beg the boys
in white coats to take her away.

579
00:34:19,503 --> 00:34:21,368
So, Mom, we're gonna
go out to dinner.

580
00:34:21,405 --> 00:34:23,305
Do you want us
to bring you back something?

581
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:25,706
Are you both going?

582
00:34:25,743 --> 00:34:27,768
Why don't you just
come with us?

583
00:34:27,811 --> 00:34:30,041
You haven't left
the house in three days.

584
00:34:31,815 --> 00:34:33,806
I can't.

585
00:34:34,918 --> 00:34:36,852
Okay.

586
00:34:50,167 --> 00:34:51,964
Hello?

587
00:35:03,013 --> 00:35:04,810
Hello?

588
00:35:07,518 --> 00:35:09,281
Hello?

589
00:35:12,923 --> 00:35:14,390
Oh my God!

590
00:35:18,062 --> 00:35:19,654
Shit.

591
00:35:21,165 --> 00:35:22,598
What do you want?!

592
00:35:22,633 --> 00:35:25,329
Oh my God!
Oh my God!

593
00:35:25,369 --> 00:35:27,997
Shit!
Oh, please, God!

594
00:35:28,038 --> 00:35:31,838
- Please... ma'am?
- 911 emergency, please hold.

595
00:35:31,875 --> 00:35:34,036
Fuck fuck fuck!

596
00:35:34,078 --> 00:35:36,512
Oh my God!
Oh my God!

597
00:35:36,547 --> 00:35:38,777
Oh my God,
oh my God!

598
00:35:38,816 --> 00:35:40,078
Shit, oh my God.
Oh my God!

599
00:35:42,619 --> 00:35:44,553
Oh God!

600
00:35:45,556 --> 00:35:47,217
Oh, shit!

601
00:35:47,257 --> 00:35:49,054
Oh God! Shit!

602
00:35:50,127 --> 00:35:52,755
Help!

603
00:35:52,796 --> 00:35:54,627
Oh my God,
oh my God!

604
00:36:05,609 --> 00:36:07,440
Our work finished.

605
00:36:07,478 --> 00:36:10,845
We returned home expecting to find her
blabbering like a three-year-old.

606
00:36:13,050 --> 00:36:14,950
Mom, we're home.

607
00:36:14,985 --> 00:36:16,953
Diane, honey...

608
00:36:18,122 --> 00:36:20,317
we brought you
a pulled pork plate.

609
00:36:27,798 --> 00:36:30,062
Diane, wake up.
It's us.

610
00:36:32,169 --> 00:36:33,659
Wake up, Mommy.

611
00:36:33,704 --> 00:36:35,729
Diane, come on.

612
00:36:36,907 --> 00:36:38,875
Diane, come on,
wake up.

613
00:36:43,147 --> 00:36:46,014
Martin, I just picked these sleeping
pills up for her yesterday.

614
00:36:47,284 --> 00:36:49,878
I suppose we should
call an ambulance.

615
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:52,252
Do you really think
they can save her?

616
00:36:52,289 --> 00:36:53,847
I don't know.

617
00:36:53,891 --> 00:36:56,883
She'll only try it again,
you know she will.

618
00:36:56,927 --> 00:36:58,895
She will if we keep
torturing her like this.

619
00:36:58,929 --> 00:37:01,056
Mini, this is wrong.
I'm gonna call an ambulance.

620
00:37:02,499 --> 00:37:03,932
Hold on,
wait wait wait.

621
00:37:03,967 --> 00:37:06,868
Who are we to say
her choice is wrong?

622
00:37:06,904 --> 00:37:09,168
She put the pills
in her mouth.

623
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:12,840
I thought we agreed
that murder was out.

624
00:37:12,876 --> 00:37:15,640
I wouldn't exactly
call this murder.

625
00:37:15,679 --> 00:37:18,944
I mean, if anything, we're just helping
to fulfill her last wish.

626
00:37:18,982 --> 00:37:21,507
Mini, she wouldn't have
done this unless we...

627
00:37:21,552 --> 00:37:23,679
Mini, for God's sake,
the woman still has a pulse.

628
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:26,211
All right, look, you can
cut the indignant outrage,

629
00:37:26,256 --> 00:37:29,248
because if you really cared, you would
have already dialed 911.

630
00:37:31,762 --> 00:37:34,731
Can't we just admit
how lucky we both are?

631
00:37:34,765 --> 00:37:38,223
This is the perfect alibi...
she put the drugs in her system.

632
00:37:38,268 --> 00:37:41,396
You're saying we should
just leave her here.

633
00:37:41,438 --> 00:37:44,407
Can you think of one person
who would say she's sane at this point?

634
00:37:47,311 --> 00:37:49,541
We're so close
to being free.

635
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:52,481
Let's just let nature
take its course.

636
00:37:56,186 --> 00:38:00,054
So we passed the time
watching my favorite show.

637
00:38:00,090 --> 00:38:03,025
Our first couple's
from Bakersfield, California...

638
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:06,154
Suzanne Terasado
and Gene Scalzo.

639
00:38:06,196 --> 00:38:08,494
They're gonna get married
in three weeks, folks.

640
00:38:08,532 --> 00:38:10,090
Date's coming up
pretty soon, huh?

641
00:38:10,133 --> 00:38:11,930
Don't answer that question.
But first,

642
00:38:11,969 --> 00:38:13,630
we send you out
on some dates huh?

643
00:38:27,751 --> 00:38:30,276
- We have to speed this up.
- What?

644
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:34,222
We can't wait anymore,
Martin, okay?

645
00:38:34,258 --> 00:38:36,818
Our alibi's only believable
for maybe another hour.

646
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:39,522
We can say
we went to a movie after dinner,

647
00:38:39,563 --> 00:38:42,327
but if she doesn't croak by midnight,
we can forget about this.

648
00:38:42,366 --> 00:38:46,769
What exactly
are you suggesting?

649
00:38:53,877 --> 00:38:55,868
Come on,
we don't have time.

650
00:38:55,912 --> 00:38:57,880
Look, if we're gonna
screw up the details,

651
00:38:57,914 --> 00:39:01,008
we might as well call San Quentin
and tell them to fire up the Dutch oven.

652
00:39:04,821 --> 00:39:06,846
You almost finished?

653
00:39:06,890 --> 00:39:08,858
What's the one thing
all her friends

654
00:39:08,892 --> 00:39:11,122
are gonna be talking about
when they find out?

655
00:39:11,161 --> 00:39:13,459
"How did she look?"

656
00:39:13,497 --> 00:39:16,466
Do you think anyone would think twice if
the answer's "Fabulous"?

657
00:39:24,508 --> 00:39:26,408
Well, if you have
any last thoughts,

658
00:39:26,443 --> 00:39:29,742
I think that now would probably be
the appropriate time.

659
00:39:31,248 --> 00:39:34,081
You could pretend
to have a little remorse.

660
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:52,794
No no no! Wait wait wait!
She's gonna be fine!

661
00:39:52,836 --> 00:39:54,804
Just tell me that
she's gonna be okay!

662
00:39:54,838 --> 00:39:57,272
Mr. Tannen, I think you should take
your daughter into the house.

663
00:39:57,307 --> 00:39:59,741
I don't wanna go
in the house right now!

664
00:39:59,776 --> 00:40:01,710
She's gonna
be fine, right?

665
00:40:01,745 --> 00:40:03,713
Just say that
she's gonna be fine first

666
00:40:03,747 --> 00:40:05,374
and then I'll go
in the house!

667
00:40:05,415 --> 00:40:07,610
It's gonna be okay.
Come on, go inside.

668
00:40:13,123 --> 00:40:15,648
All right, we're almost
wrapped up in here.

669
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,951
I'll see you tomorrow.

670
00:40:23,967 --> 00:40:26,492
- Mr. Tannen.
- Oh.

671
00:40:26,536 --> 00:40:29,403
- Yes.
- Hi.

672
00:40:29,439 --> 00:40:31,999
Detective
Dwight Garson, L.A.P.D.

673
00:40:32,042 --> 00:40:35,409
I'm very sorry
to be here right now,

674
00:40:35,445 --> 00:40:38,642
but, you know, whenever there's
an apparent suicide,

675
00:40:38,682 --> 00:40:40,650
we're required to do
an investigation

676
00:40:40,684 --> 00:40:42,515
just to rule out
homicide.

677
00:40:42,552 --> 00:40:45,953
- Right.
- It's really just a formality.

678
00:40:45,989 --> 00:40:48,685
Formality?

679
00:40:48,725 --> 00:40:51,319
My mother just
killed herself.

680
00:40:51,361 --> 00:40:54,057
They haven't even taken her away yet.
What's wrong with you?

681
00:40:54,097 --> 00:40:56,065
Mini, honey, the man
is just doing his job.

682
00:40:56,099 --> 00:40:59,000
I don't care.
Tell him to leave. This is outrageous.

683
00:40:59,035 --> 00:41:01,560
- Could we do this some other time?
- Of course, Mr. Tannen.

684
00:41:01,605 --> 00:41:02,867
I appreciate that.
Thank you.

685
00:41:02,906 --> 00:41:05,374
But I will need to ask you

686
00:41:05,409 --> 00:41:07,877
just a few simple questions
before I leave, if that's okay.

687
00:41:07,911 --> 00:41:10,277
- Okay.
- I'm sorry, but did you hear him?

688
00:41:10,313 --> 00:41:11,940
I believe he said
you need to leave.

689
00:41:11,982 --> 00:41:13,540
Mini, let's go
to your room,

690
00:41:13,583 --> 00:41:16,017
and you lie down for a little while,
please. Come on.

691
00:41:19,289 --> 00:41:21,553
So after dinner
and the movie,

692
00:41:21,591 --> 00:41:25,618
we came home at 11:30
and found her in the garage,

693
00:41:25,662 --> 00:41:28,529
and I... turned off
the car,

694
00:41:28,565 --> 00:41:30,533
and I opened
the garage door

695
00:41:30,567 --> 00:41:33,559
to let the fumes out.

696
00:41:35,172 --> 00:41:38,369
So... your wife
would have done this

697
00:41:38,408 --> 00:41:42,401
sometime between
8:00 and 11:33

698
00:41:42,446 --> 00:41:45,108
when you made
the 911 call?

699
00:41:45,148 --> 00:41:48,276
- Yes.
- So this was your wife's car?

700
00:41:48,318 --> 00:41:50,013
Yes.

701
00:41:50,053 --> 00:41:52,578
And...

702
00:41:52,622 --> 00:41:56,114
was it in the garage
when you went to dinner

703
00:41:56,159 --> 00:41:57,820
or did she drive it in?

704
00:41:57,861 --> 00:42:01,194
- Is that important?
- Oh well, you know,

705
00:42:01,231 --> 00:42:04,098
I'm just kind of trying
to reconstruct what happened.

706
00:42:04,134 --> 00:42:07,001
Well, when my wife
came home from the mall,

707
00:42:07,037 --> 00:42:10,564
we had the car towed here
and we put it in the garage.

708
00:42:10,607 --> 00:42:12,575
Well, if it's okay,

709
00:42:12,609 --> 00:42:15,407
I'm gonna have them
impound it,

710
00:42:15,445 --> 00:42:17,709
and we'll take it
down to the crime lab.

711
00:42:17,747 --> 00:42:19,647
Take it down
to the crime lab?

712
00:42:19,683 --> 00:42:21,981
Yeah, again, you know,
it's just purely routine.

713
00:42:22,018 --> 00:42:24,009
Right.

714
00:42:26,323 --> 00:42:27,984
Yeah...

715
00:42:28,024 --> 00:42:30,322
so, uh...

716
00:42:31,862 --> 00:42:35,389
have you... have you
found a note yet?

717
00:42:39,135 --> 00:42:41,000
You mean
a suicide note?

718
00:42:41,037 --> 00:42:45,497
Yeah, usually the deceased
tend to leave one.

719
00:42:47,043 --> 00:42:49,944
Uh no no,
we haven't,

720
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:52,471
but we haven't been
looking for one either.

721
00:42:52,516 --> 00:42:54,484
Right.

722
00:42:54,518 --> 00:42:56,850
Right...

723
00:42:58,321 --> 00:43:01,313
Well, do you mind
if I have a look around?

724
00:43:01,358 --> 00:43:03,918
No no no.

725
00:43:11,268 --> 00:43:13,429
Who cares if we
didn't leave a note?

726
00:43:13,470 --> 00:43:15,438
- Just relax!
- He says...

727
00:43:15,472 --> 00:43:17,269
So what? He'll do
his little dance,

728
00:43:17,307 --> 00:43:19,104
and chalk it up
to another failed actress

729
00:43:19,142 --> 00:43:21,269
who realized after 40
she might as well be dead.

730
00:43:21,311 --> 00:43:23,279
Okay.

731
00:43:24,381 --> 00:43:26,474
- Shit!
- What?

732
00:43:26,516 --> 00:43:29,041
I forgot about the sweatsuits
and the goggles.

733
00:43:29,085 --> 00:43:30,712
I already snuck out back
and threw them

734
00:43:30,754 --> 00:43:32,119
in Mike Rudell's
garbage cans.

735
00:43:34,858 --> 00:43:38,191
Good. Very good.

736
00:43:38,228 --> 00:43:40,662
Just relax.

737
00:43:40,697 --> 00:43:42,392
We did it.

738
00:43:44,701 --> 00:43:46,191
We're free.

739
00:44:13,530 --> 00:44:16,499
Before that, I was actually
working in catering,

740
00:44:16,533 --> 00:44:18,933
but I discovered I had
this amazing talent

741
00:44:18,969 --> 00:44:21,164
to read people's flower auras.
If I may just...

742
00:44:22,806 --> 00:44:24,831
Venus flytrap.

743
00:44:24,874 --> 00:44:26,739
You scared me.

744
00:44:27,877 --> 00:44:29,777
Just keep 'em coming.

745
00:44:29,813 --> 00:44:32,407
It's a tragic tragic loss.

746
00:44:32,449 --> 00:44:34,474
- Thank you so much.
- Is this soy?

747
00:44:34,517 --> 00:44:36,883
- You know, this could be tofurkey.
- Not for me.

748
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:39,218
Is this tofurkey?
It could be okay.

749
00:44:42,626 --> 00:44:45,322
- It's good.
- You're so delighted by small things.

750
00:44:45,362 --> 00:44:49,059
Mm. Does anybody know how...
how is Mini doing?

751
00:44:49,099 --> 00:44:51,158
I hear she's
totally devastated.

752
00:44:51,201 --> 00:44:52,600
- She's... wh... what?
- Just look at her.

753
00:44:54,371 --> 00:44:56,737
Martin, I mean, think of him.
He's a single parent now.

754
00:44:56,773 --> 00:45:00,106
He's going to need all the support
he can get from family and friends.

755
00:45:00,143 --> 00:45:01,974
Oh, it takes a village.

756
00:45:02,012 --> 00:45:03,502
The wake was a riot.

757
00:45:03,546 --> 00:45:05,912
With Mom out of the way,
Martin suddenly became

758
00:45:05,949 --> 00:45:07,507
prime target
number one.

759
00:45:07,550 --> 00:45:08,881
Would you excuse me?

760
00:45:08,918 --> 00:45:10,385
She wasn't even cold yet,

761
00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:12,183
and already her friends
were realizing

762
00:45:12,222 --> 00:45:14,087
whoever could dump
their hubbies the fastest

763
00:45:14,124 --> 00:45:16,217
could actually marry someone
they'd want to sleep with.

764
00:45:16,259 --> 00:45:17,988
- Martin?
- Hi.

765
00:45:18,028 --> 00:45:19,757
How are you holding up?

766
00:45:19,796 --> 00:45:22,026
Well, the nights
are the roughest.

767
00:45:22,065 --> 00:45:25,364
I hope you know that despite our
little disagreement,

768
00:45:25,402 --> 00:45:27,461
Diane was like
a sister to me.

769
00:45:27,504 --> 00:45:28,937
I know.

770
00:45:28,972 --> 00:45:32,772
And if you ever need
someone to talk to,

771
00:45:32,809 --> 00:45:34,504
or even just a hug...

772
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:39,242
I can be over
in 10 minutes.

773
00:45:46,690 --> 00:45:48,487
After the funeral,

774
00:45:48,525 --> 00:45:50,652
I felt it would be a good idea if
we took a vacation,

775
00:45:50,694 --> 00:45:53,857
and went someplace where we can act
like a real couple for the first time.

776
00:46:24,527 --> 00:46:28,156
I could feel that Martin had let
that whole thing with the cops go.

777
00:46:39,309 --> 00:46:41,743
It had been two weeks
since Mom's death,

778
00:46:41,778 --> 00:46:43,905
and already it felt like
it happened a year ago.

779
00:47:01,498 --> 00:47:03,398
Martin? Mini?

780
00:47:03,433 --> 00:47:05,765
Hi. I thought
that was you.

781
00:47:05,802 --> 00:47:08,965
Mike, what are you
doing here?

782
00:47:09,005 --> 00:47:12,168
Uh, last week
Mini mentioned

783
00:47:12,208 --> 00:47:14,938
that you guys were gonna
come down here for a little R and R,

784
00:47:14,978 --> 00:47:18,004
and I suddenly realized
that I hadn't taken a vacation

785
00:47:18,047 --> 00:47:21,813
in God knows when.
Jennifer, this is Martin Tannen,

786
00:47:21,851 --> 00:47:24,285
my next-door neighbor
and his daughter Mini.

787
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:26,049
And here's the kicker.

788
00:47:26,089 --> 00:47:28,683
Jennifer works for
the same escort service that I did.

789
00:47:28,725 --> 00:47:30,522
I'm sorry, Jennifer,
but have we met?

790
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:32,323
You look really familiar.

791
00:47:32,362 --> 00:47:34,330
I don't think so.

792
00:47:34,364 --> 00:47:36,491
No? Are you sure?
Have we worked together?

793
00:47:40,170 --> 00:47:43,571
That's impossible, because I just moved
here from Canada...

794
00:47:43,606 --> 00:47:46,166
the Yukon Territories.

795
00:47:50,013 --> 00:47:52,038
I just wanted
you both to know

796
00:47:52,081 --> 00:47:54,106
how sorry I am
for your loss.

797
00:47:54,150 --> 00:47:55,845
Our loss?

798
00:47:55,885 --> 00:47:57,978
He just lost six or seven freebies
a year from Mom.

799
00:47:58,021 --> 00:48:00,285
Look at him.
He's a profile in courage.

800
00:48:00,323 --> 00:48:02,621
If there's anything
that I can do

801
00:48:02,659 --> 00:48:05,184
for either of you,

802
00:48:05,228 --> 00:48:07,753
don't hesitate to ask.

803
00:48:07,797 --> 00:48:11,597
Remember, I'm just...
I'm right across the fence.

804
00:48:13,002 --> 00:48:14,867
Thanks, Mike.

805
00:48:14,904 --> 00:48:16,633
We appreciate that.

806
00:48:16,673 --> 00:48:18,732
Breakfast tomorrow...
frittata.

807
00:48:18,775 --> 00:48:21,039
I'm sending over
a frittata for you guys.

808
00:48:21,077 --> 00:48:22,908
Don't be surprised.
Okay, bye-bye.

809
00:48:25,715 --> 00:48:27,376
Why did you tell him?

810
00:48:27,417 --> 00:48:29,044
I was just being
friendly, okay?

811
00:48:29,085 --> 00:48:30,677
I didn't think
he'd actually come.

812
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:33,746
He knows.
He found the goggles and the clothes,

813
00:48:33,790 --> 00:48:35,314
and he fuckin' knows.

814
00:48:35,358 --> 00:48:37,826
I doubt he even knows
where his trash cans are.

815
00:48:37,861 --> 00:48:40,193
Relax, it was
just a coincidence.

816
00:48:40,230 --> 00:48:42,755
Coincidence or not,
he saw us together.

817
00:48:42,799 --> 00:48:44,096
Let's go,
let's get in the car.

818
00:48:44,133 --> 00:48:45,896
- It was dark...
- Let's go to the airport.

819
00:48:45,935 --> 00:48:47,869
- It was dark outside.
- No no no no no.

820
00:48:47,904 --> 00:48:49,701
He was toying with us.
You didn't see that,

821
00:48:49,739 --> 00:48:51,206
the way that he was
toying with us?

822
00:48:51,241 --> 00:48:52,333
- No, I didn't.
- No?

823
00:48:52,375 --> 00:48:53,933
No.

824
00:48:53,977 --> 00:48:55,308
What is he
gonna do, huh?

825
00:48:55,345 --> 00:48:58,109
Go home and tell everyone
we're a couple?

826
00:48:58,147 --> 00:49:01,605
We'll just laugh it off
and say he vacations with hookers.

827
00:49:01,651 --> 00:49:03,118
Okay, thank you.

828
00:49:03,152 --> 00:49:05,052
Let's get in the car
and let's go to the airport now.

829
00:49:05,088 --> 00:49:06,282
- Come on.
- Martin, come on.

830
00:49:06,322 --> 00:49:08,756
Calm down, all right?
Nothing is going to happen.

831
00:49:08,791 --> 00:49:12,659
Let's just go inside
and have another drink, okay?

832
00:49:15,231 --> 00:49:17,062
- Aurelio?
- Sí, señorita?

833
00:49:17,100 --> 00:49:18,897
Hi, we're actually
gonna stay,

834
00:49:18,935 --> 00:49:20,630
so can you bring
these bags in for us?

835
00:49:20,670 --> 00:49:22,035
But of course.

836
00:49:36,886 --> 00:49:38,854
No thank you.

837
00:49:41,991 --> 00:49:44,323
The next few days
were a real hoot.

838
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:48,057
Suddenly, Martin was acting like
he really was my father.

839
00:50:08,084 --> 00:50:11,144
We returned home
and things didn't get much better.

840
00:50:11,187 --> 00:50:13,451
What little sex
we were having was getting dull.

841
00:50:13,489 --> 00:50:17,391
I tried spicing things up
with a little role-playing,

842
00:50:17,427 --> 00:50:20,191
but I was becoming concerned
that in my world of firsts,

843
00:50:20,229 --> 00:50:23,096
I'd achieved my greatest first
at too young an age.

844
00:50:30,006 --> 00:50:32,270
- Hi.
- Yes?

845
00:50:32,308 --> 00:50:34,799
Minerva Tannen,
Detective Garson.

846
00:50:34,844 --> 00:50:37,108
I don't know if you remember me
from that night.

847
00:50:37,146 --> 00:50:39,137
Drogues.
My last name is Drogues,

848
00:50:39,182 --> 00:50:41,616
and yes, I remember you.
You were the bighearted lug

849
00:50:41,651 --> 00:50:44,745
who wanted your questions answered
while my mother was still warm.

850
00:50:44,787 --> 00:50:47,881
Again, I'm sorry
about that night,

851
00:50:47,924 --> 00:50:50,552
but it is policy that
we get the preliminary facts

852
00:50:50,593 --> 00:50:52,356
as soon as possible.
Sorry.

853
00:50:52,395 --> 00:50:55,887
- What do you want?
- I need to ask you a few more questions

854
00:50:55,932 --> 00:50:57,456
about your mother's death.

855
00:50:59,302 --> 00:51:01,099
- All right, come in.
- Thank you.

856
00:51:01,137 --> 00:51:03,901
I know it's
stupid as hell

857
00:51:03,940 --> 00:51:05,669
to talk to a cop
without a lawyer,

858
00:51:05,708 --> 00:51:07,335
but I didn't want
to look jumpy.

859
00:51:07,377 --> 00:51:09,777
At my first
real interrogation,

860
00:51:09,812 --> 00:51:12,576
I could literally feel
something tingle deep inside.

861
00:51:12,615 --> 00:51:15,516
It's a little early
for the prom, isn't it?

862
00:51:15,551 --> 00:51:18,042
A girl can dream,
can't she?

863
00:51:18,087 --> 00:51:20,180
It's perfectly legal,
sure.

864
00:51:20,223 --> 00:51:21,986
So, anyway,

865
00:51:22,025 --> 00:51:25,051
we got the preliminary
coroner's report.

866
00:51:25,094 --> 00:51:28,325
Although the pills rendered
your mother unconscious,

867
00:51:28,364 --> 00:51:32,858
she died from the carbon monoxide
fumes from the exhaust.

868
00:51:32,902 --> 00:51:35,370
Is that important?

869
00:51:35,405 --> 00:51:39,603
Well, it's just
a little unusual

870
00:51:39,642 --> 00:51:42,042
for a suicide victim
to use two methods.

871
00:51:42,078 --> 00:51:45,741
Well, maybe she wanted
to drift off before the fumes got her.

872
00:51:45,782 --> 00:51:48,979
Yeah, I suppose
you're right.

873
00:51:49,018 --> 00:51:51,748
We also got
the phone records

874
00:51:51,788 --> 00:51:54,188
and there was a 911 call
placed at 8:12.

875
00:51:54,223 --> 00:51:56,589
It was a hang up.

876
00:51:56,626 --> 00:51:58,787
- Really?
- Yeah.

877
00:51:58,828 --> 00:52:03,128
Any idea why your mom
might have called 911?

878
00:52:03,166 --> 00:52:05,031
Okay, fine.

879
00:52:05,068 --> 00:52:07,559
This may be the most exciting thing
I've done in a while,

880
00:52:07,603 --> 00:52:09,969
but even I know
when the rush isn't worth the risk.

881
00:52:10,006 --> 00:52:13,066
Listen, Detective, I think you should
come back when my father's home.

882
00:52:13,109 --> 00:52:15,634
He'll probably be upset
that I let a stranger in the house.

883
00:52:17,847 --> 00:52:20,577
Yeah, I think
you're safe with me.

884
00:52:22,051 --> 00:52:23,575
Even so,
he won't be happy.

885
00:52:23,619 --> 00:52:26,110
Not a problem.

886
00:52:26,155 --> 00:52:29,283
So will he
be back tonight?

887
00:52:29,325 --> 00:52:33,728
- I'll give him a call.
- Okay, thanks.

888
00:52:33,763 --> 00:52:36,755
And you let him in?

889
00:52:36,799 --> 00:52:39,393
It would have looked worse
to be defensive.

890
00:52:39,435 --> 00:52:41,903
And when's
he coming over?

891
00:52:41,938 --> 00:52:43,735
Tonight.

892
00:52:43,773 --> 00:52:46,503
Tonight?
I've got a dinner with Chapman.

893
00:52:46,542 --> 00:52:48,169
I've already canceled
on him twice.

894
00:52:48,211 --> 00:52:49,678
Damn it!
Why didn't you call me?

895
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:53,275
I'm sorry.
I didn't know you had plans.

896
00:52:54,550 --> 00:52:56,177
All right, listen,
I'll be home early

897
00:52:56,219 --> 00:52:57,948
so we can get
our story straight, okay?

898
00:52:57,987 --> 00:53:00,512
Okay.

899
00:53:09,298 --> 00:53:12,028
I really do appreciate
you taking the time to help us out.

900
00:53:12,068 --> 00:53:14,798
You know, there's just a few
loose ends we need to tie up.

901
00:53:14,837 --> 00:53:17,601
Absolutely. What would
you like to know?

902
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:20,609
Well, there seems
to be some question

903
00:53:20,643 --> 00:53:22,611
as to the time
of your wife's death.

904
00:53:22,645 --> 00:53:26,308
You said that you went
to dinner and a movie?

905
00:53:26,349 --> 00:53:29,944
Detective, I don't mean to sound
overly sensitive,

906
00:53:29,986 --> 00:53:31,613
but do I need
my attorney here?

907
00:53:31,654 --> 00:53:34,953
Because these sound like the questions
you would ask a suspect

908
00:53:34,991 --> 00:53:36,686
in a homicide
investigation.

909
00:53:36,726 --> 00:53:41,095
Well, Mr. Tannen, I really just kinda
wanna finish this up, you know?

910
00:53:41,130 --> 00:53:43,564
I have real homicides
that need my attention.

911
00:53:43,599 --> 00:53:46,864
So how about this?

912
00:53:46,903 --> 00:53:49,394
You know,
I'll ask you some questions,

913
00:53:49,438 --> 00:53:51,406
and the ones you
don't want to answer,

914
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:53,465
well, we can
just skip those.

915
00:53:53,509 --> 00:53:55,909
Yeah, that sounds good,
doesn't it, Dad?

916
00:53:55,945 --> 00:53:58,072
Let's just get this
over with.

917
00:53:59,582 --> 00:54:01,174
Please go ahead.

918
00:54:01,217 --> 00:54:05,620
All right. You said that after dinner
you went to a movie?

919
00:54:05,655 --> 00:54:08,249
- That's right.
- Start time: 9:00.

920
00:54:08,291 --> 00:54:12,284
- What'd you see?
- We saw that Jackie Chan movie

921
00:54:12,328 --> 00:54:16,196
where he tries to stop the terrorists
from blowing up Mount Rushmore.

922
00:54:16,232 --> 00:54:18,462
Running time:
115 minutes.

923
00:54:18,501 --> 00:54:19,763
Yeah, a buddy of mine
saw it.

924
00:54:19,802 --> 00:54:21,633
He said that the ending
was pretty crazy.

925
00:54:21,671 --> 00:54:24,265
For God's sakes, does he think
we wouldn't actually see it?

926
00:54:24,307 --> 00:54:26,138
Yeah, they're sliding down
Washington's nose,

927
00:54:26,175 --> 00:54:27,642
and the guy's got
the bomb strapped in.

928
00:54:27,677 --> 00:54:29,372
Don't tell him.
He hasn't seen it yet.

929
00:54:29,412 --> 00:54:31,642
- Another demerit for me.
- Aw, that's okay.

930
00:54:31,681 --> 00:54:33,979
So, uh,
where'd you see it?

931
00:54:34,016 --> 00:54:37,417
- The Galleria.
- Drive time: 17 minutes.

932
00:54:37,453 --> 00:54:40,013
- And you got home when?
- 11:30.

933
00:54:40,056 --> 00:54:42,149
Precisely, with
12 minutes of previews.

934
00:54:42,191 --> 00:54:44,216
You didn't think
we'd forget the previews?

935
00:54:44,260 --> 00:54:47,491
Detective, if you don't have any further
questions, it is a school night.

936
00:54:47,530 --> 00:54:49,760
Oh right, yes.
Sorry.

937
00:54:49,799 --> 00:54:52,893
No, I think that about wraps it up
for now. Thanks.

938
00:54:52,935 --> 00:54:54,129
For now?

939
00:54:56,138 --> 00:54:58,834
Detective,
we're trying very hard

940
00:54:58,874 --> 00:55:00,808
to put back the pieces
of our lives.

941
00:55:00,843 --> 00:55:03,744
And every time you come by,
you dredge all this up again.

942
00:55:03,779 --> 00:55:05,838
I've already told you
everything that I know.

943
00:55:05,881 --> 00:55:08,179
Sorry, I wish I could be
more definitive... I can't.

944
00:55:08,217 --> 00:55:11,243
Well, I'm telling you that if you do
come back with more questions,

945
00:55:11,287 --> 00:55:13,619
I hope it's because you're
charging us with something.

946
00:55:16,092 --> 00:55:18,117
Us?

947
00:55:38,681 --> 00:55:40,740
I can't believe I let you
talk me into this.

948
00:55:45,855 --> 00:55:47,914
I'm sure that was
just routine stuff.

949
00:55:47,957 --> 00:55:50,448
Honey, that was anything but routine,
let me tell you.

950
00:55:52,094 --> 00:55:54,289
Nice use
of the word "us," by the way.

951
00:55:54,330 --> 00:55:56,321
It slipped out, okay?
I'm sorry.

952
00:55:57,767 --> 00:56:00,361
You know, if I had a nickel
for every time I heard that...

953
00:56:00,403 --> 00:56:02,428
Okay.

954
00:56:02,471 --> 00:56:04,336
Just chill out,
all right?

955
00:56:04,373 --> 00:56:06,773
I'm sure this will all
blow over in a few days.

956
00:56:06,809 --> 00:56:10,210
Chill out?
Did you just tell me to chill out?

957
00:56:10,246 --> 00:56:13,010
You realize they could go
for the death penalty, don't you?

958
00:56:13,049 --> 00:56:15,609
He was probably
just trying to spook us.

959
00:56:15,651 --> 00:56:18,620
They only try to spook you
if they really think you did it.

960
00:56:20,756 --> 00:56:22,849
Look, it was
a great plan, okay?

961
00:56:22,892 --> 00:56:26,055
No one can prove that we put those pills
in her mouth because we didn't.

962
00:56:26,095 --> 00:56:27,892
If it's such a great plan,
then why am I

963
00:56:27,930 --> 00:56:30,899
canceling dinners with important clients
to accommodate a detective

964
00:56:30,933 --> 00:56:32,924
who doesn't believe
that it was a suicide, huh?

965
00:56:32,968 --> 00:56:36,131
If you're so
fucking smart!

966
00:56:39,775 --> 00:56:41,333
See you later.

967
00:56:43,012 --> 00:56:44,775
Where are you going?

968
00:56:44,814 --> 00:56:46,714
Out.

969
00:58:35,858 --> 00:58:38,918
A phone call would have
been appreciated at some point.

970
00:58:38,961 --> 00:58:41,327
I was worried about you.

971
00:58:41,363 --> 00:58:45,356
Martin, I'm not sure
you're aware,

972
00:58:45,401 --> 00:58:47,961
but at this point
you can't be my dad and my lover.

973
00:58:48,003 --> 00:58:50,631
I'm not saying that
as your dad.

974
00:58:51,807 --> 00:58:55,868
Before your mother
and I grew apart,

975
00:58:55,911 --> 00:58:57,902
I would be worried
when she was out late.

976
00:58:57,947 --> 00:59:00,711
Well, I'm not her,
so I can assure you

977
00:59:00,749 --> 00:59:05,243
you won't find me drunk, passed out in
some greaseball's fuckpad

978
00:59:05,287 --> 00:59:08,950
with my panties around my ankles...
unless I choose to.

979
00:59:08,991 --> 00:59:11,118
What the hell
has gotten into you?

980
00:59:11,160 --> 00:59:15,119
I express some concern for you,
and you threaten me?

981
00:59:15,164 --> 00:59:17,291
Mini, when you're
in a relationship,

982
00:59:17,333 --> 00:59:20,131
it's okay to worry
about someone.

983
00:59:20,169 --> 00:59:23,138
Have you ever been
in a relationship, Mini?

984
00:59:28,244 --> 00:59:31,839
My God, you haven't,
have you?

985
00:59:37,119 --> 00:59:39,087
Congratulations,

986
00:59:39,121 --> 00:59:40,986
you're my first.

987
00:59:53,435 --> 00:59:55,164
Good morning.

988
00:59:58,207 --> 01:00:00,573
- This just arrived for you.
- Thank you.

989
01:00:06,282 --> 01:00:08,273
Martin Tannen's office,

990
01:00:08,317 --> 01:00:10,217
how may I help you?

991
01:00:13,389 --> 01:00:15,289
Yes, everything
has been resolved.

992
01:00:15,324 --> 01:00:17,952
Thank you so much
for calling.

993
01:00:21,196 --> 01:00:23,596
- Lois.
- Yes?

994
01:00:23,632 --> 01:00:25,497
We have to reschedule
the Chapman meeting.

995
01:00:27,736 --> 01:00:31,331
I know, just tell them
it's an unavoidable emergency.

996
01:00:38,447 --> 01:00:41,939
Shit shit shit
shit, fuck fuck!

997
01:00:45,487 --> 01:00:47,751
Are you okay?

998
01:00:50,359 --> 01:00:54,056
What do you mean you don't keep records
of who the senders are?

999
01:00:54,096 --> 01:00:55,927
When it's paid cash,
we only keep records

1000
01:00:55,965 --> 01:00:57,364
on packages.
Not envelopes.

1001
01:01:01,437 --> 01:01:03,632
Excuse me.

1002
01:01:03,672 --> 01:01:06,004
- Yeah?
- Mr. Tannen?

1003
01:01:06,041 --> 01:01:08,737
- Uh-huh.
- I just spoke to Mr. Chapman.

1004
01:01:08,777 --> 01:01:12,577
- Uh-huh.
- He... he told me to tell you

1005
01:01:12,615 --> 01:01:16,346
that he is going to be seeking a new
firm to handle his company's needs

1006
01:01:16,385 --> 01:01:19,286
and Mr. Mather
and Mr. Boyd

1007
01:01:19,321 --> 01:01:21,949
have asked to see you
when you return to the office.

1008
01:01:21,991 --> 01:01:24,152
Thank you, Lois.

1009
01:01:40,776 --> 01:01:42,801
What's up, guys?

1010
01:01:42,845 --> 01:01:44,506
Have a seat.

1011
01:01:45,881 --> 01:01:48,179
Do I want
to have a seat?

1012
01:01:49,785 --> 01:01:51,776
We just got
a call from Chapman.

1013
01:01:51,820 --> 01:01:54,653
Well, the old guy
is a little unstable, we all know that.

1014
01:01:54,690 --> 01:01:56,351
"Unstable"?

1015
01:01:56,392 --> 01:01:58,986
He told us you canceled three meetings
on him at the last minute.

1016
01:01:59,028 --> 01:02:01,155
Well, Jesus, my wife
just committed suicide,

1017
01:02:01,196 --> 01:02:03,027
so please forgive me
if I've been a little...

1018
01:02:03,065 --> 01:02:05,033
No one's saying this hasn't been
a difficult time for you,

1019
01:02:05,067 --> 01:02:08,093
but whatever's been distracting you,
Martin, started long before that.

1020
01:02:08,137 --> 01:02:10,697
- Chapman was a whale.
- A whale that I brought in.

1021
01:02:10,739 --> 01:02:13,640
- And now you've lost.
- A whale we couldn't afford to lose.

1022
01:02:13,676 --> 01:02:15,906
Clients come and go,
we all know that.

1023
01:02:15,944 --> 01:02:17,707
It's musical chairs,
it always has been.

1024
01:02:17,746 --> 01:02:20,340
I mean, what is the big deal?
I'll land another whale.

1025
01:02:20,382 --> 01:02:22,816
In fact, Jerry Burgess from IBS
just called me this morning.

1026
01:02:22,851 --> 01:02:24,648
He wants me
to play 18 at the Riv.

1027
01:02:24,687 --> 01:02:27,417
I'll spot him three aside and push
a four-footer on the last one.

1028
01:02:27,456 --> 01:02:31,187
He'll be ours by Friday.
Come on, guys!

1029
01:02:31,226 --> 01:02:33,194
We've made
our decision.

1030
01:02:34,363 --> 01:02:36,661
You've made your dec...

1031
01:02:36,699 --> 01:02:38,997
this is my company.

1032
01:02:39,034 --> 01:02:40,831
You came to me.

1033
01:02:40,869 --> 01:02:42,962
I was landing whales
like Chapman

1034
01:02:43,005 --> 01:02:46,634
when you two jerk-offs were playing
beer pong in your frat basement

1035
01:02:46,675 --> 01:02:49,200
and slipping roofies
to the local high school girls!

1036
01:02:49,244 --> 01:02:51,769
I don't give a shit
what decisions you've made!

1037
01:02:51,814 --> 01:02:53,839
This is my firm!

1038
01:02:55,484 --> 01:02:57,714
Look at that smug prick.

1039
01:02:57,753 --> 01:03:01,211
He is fucking with me
and I will not be fucked with!

1040
01:03:01,256 --> 01:03:03,520
What are you gonna do?

1041
01:03:03,559 --> 01:03:06,892
I'm gonna go over there and tell him if
he doesn't back off he's gonna get hurt.

1042
01:03:06,929 --> 01:03:08,954
Are you crazy? We're not
even sure it's him.

1043
01:03:08,997 --> 01:03:10,692
For God's sakes,
the pictures were sent

1044
01:03:10,733 --> 01:03:13,395
from a messenger agency
right in his own building.

1045
01:03:13,435 --> 01:03:15,835
He was the only person
at the resort who knew who we were.

1046
01:03:15,871 --> 01:03:19,238
Okay, but then he could go to the cops
and tell them you threatened him.

1047
01:03:19,274 --> 01:03:21,071
Then they'd really start
investigating us.

1048
01:03:22,845 --> 01:03:24,836
That son of a bitch
cost me the firm

1049
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:27,144
that took me
15 years to build!

1050
01:03:28,283 --> 01:03:30,342
15 years.

1051
01:03:32,387 --> 01:03:34,821
Well, if you go to his house
and you start waving this around,

1052
01:03:34,857 --> 01:03:36,757
it's gonna cost you
a lot more than that.

1053
01:03:42,831 --> 01:03:44,958
Martin didn't sleep
at all that night.

1054
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,093
And made damn well sure
I didn't either.

1055
01:04:03,185 --> 01:04:05,585
- Minerva Drogues.
- Hi, Mr. Rudell.

1056
01:04:05,621 --> 01:04:08,454
- Hi. Mike, please.
- Mike, of course.

1057
01:04:08,490 --> 01:04:10,981
- Can I come in?
- Come on, come on, please.

1058
01:04:11,026 --> 01:04:13,517
- Okay.
- Come on.

1059
01:04:15,130 --> 01:04:17,564
Oh wow, I haven't been here
since you redecorated.

1060
01:04:17,599 --> 01:04:19,567
Yeah, I just... I just
got all this finished.

1061
01:04:19,601 --> 01:04:23,196
I'm so sorry that your mother
never got to see it.

1062
01:04:23,238 --> 01:04:25,297
I'm sure she'd approve.

1063
01:04:25,340 --> 01:04:28,798
Oh. Hey, if you
don't mind my asking...

1064
01:04:31,713 --> 01:04:34,773
- how are you doing?
- I'm all right.

1065
01:04:34,817 --> 01:04:36,785
- I mean it's been hard.
- Yeah yeah yeah.

1066
01:04:36,819 --> 01:04:38,719
I guess I just keep
telling myself that

1067
01:04:38,754 --> 01:04:41,689
she's probably much happier
where she is now.

1068
01:04:41,723 --> 01:04:44,351
Oh... gosh. You know what?
You're absolutely...

1069
01:04:44,393 --> 01:04:47,123
- Positive?
- No, I was going to say...

1070
01:04:47,162 --> 01:04:49,130
correct.

1071
01:04:49,164 --> 01:04:51,189
Have you seen that show?

1072
01:04:52,234 --> 01:04:54,566
Have I seen that show?

1073
01:04:54,603 --> 01:04:57,401
Stop it!
That's my favorite show,

1074
01:04:57,439 --> 01:04:59,373
- I love that show.
- Don't don't.

1075
01:04:59,408 --> 01:05:01,569
I am not lying to you,
that's my favorite show.

1076
01:05:01,610 --> 01:05:04,238
I love how you never know if the couples
are going to stay together.

1077
01:05:04,279 --> 01:05:07,373
Guh. You know
if you'd ever want to visit the set,

1078
01:05:07,416 --> 01:05:10,476
by the way, or spend the day
or even be a contestant...

1079
01:05:10,519 --> 01:05:12,453
What do you mean,
be a contestant?

1080
01:05:12,487 --> 01:05:14,352
Well, you know,
those date's are totally harmless,

1081
01:05:14,389 --> 01:05:17,051
you spend the evening with a person, we
prep you on what to say before the show,

1082
01:05:17,092 --> 01:05:19,526
- if that would be fun.
- That would be so much fun for me,

1083
01:05:19,561 --> 01:05:21,222
I would love that.

1084
01:05:21,263 --> 01:05:23,993
- Really? Okay. Okay.
- Really. It could be fun.

1085
01:05:24,032 --> 01:05:26,227
- Well, then I'll arrange it.
- You will?

1086
01:05:27,803 --> 01:05:29,930
It's done. Umm...

1087
01:05:29,972 --> 01:05:32,406
- Anyway, have a seat.
- Okay.

1088
01:05:33,609 --> 01:05:37,670
What's...
what's on your mind?

1089
01:05:37,713 --> 01:05:39,374
Tell me.

1090
01:05:39,414 --> 01:05:41,575
You know, l... I know this
might sound somewhat strange,

1091
01:05:41,617 --> 01:05:45,348
but have you seen any suspicious-looking
people around my house lately?

1092
01:05:47,089 --> 01:05:49,114
No. Why? What's...

1093
01:05:49,157 --> 01:05:51,182
is everything okay?
Do I have to bust some heads?

1094
01:05:51,226 --> 01:05:53,251
Not today.

1095
01:05:53,295 --> 01:05:55,286
- What's happening?
- No, everything's fine.

1096
01:05:55,330 --> 01:05:56,957
It's just that after
my mom died someone sent

1097
01:05:56,999 --> 01:05:59,832
this really weird picture
of me and Martin together.

1098
01:05:59,868 --> 01:06:02,837
- Together?
- Well, it implied that...

1099
01:06:02,871 --> 01:06:06,102
I know this sounds crazy,
but it implied that we were a couple.

1100
01:06:06,141 --> 01:06:07,870
A couple?

1101
01:06:07,910 --> 01:06:10,777
You and Martin?
Hmm.

1102
01:06:12,080 --> 01:06:13,980
Hmm. Well...

1103
01:06:14,016 --> 01:06:17,884
certainly relations between
older men and younger women

1104
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:21,651
are, uh... are an accepted
part of society,

1105
01:06:21,690 --> 01:06:23,715
but that must
be creepy, huh,

1106
01:06:23,759 --> 01:06:26,057
getting an anonymous picture?
That is so disturbing.

1107
01:06:26,094 --> 01:06:28,460
- Yeah. Yeah, it was.
- Hey, just out of curiosity,

1108
01:06:28,497 --> 01:06:30,897
what kind of picture
could they have sent you

1109
01:06:30,933 --> 01:06:33,697
to indicate that you
and Martin were a couple?

1110
01:06:33,735 --> 01:06:36,795
Well, it's not like
I was naked or anything.

1111
01:06:36,838 --> 01:06:39,568
I mean, don't get me wrong,
Martin has seen me naked.

1112
01:06:39,608 --> 01:06:41,371
He's my stepfather,
so he's seen me naked...

1113
01:06:41,410 --> 01:06:44,504
- Of course.
...but I wasn't naked in the pictures.

1114
01:06:55,757 --> 01:06:57,850
Okay, sing here, sin...

1115
01:06:57,893 --> 01:07:00,225
wow, you're full
of chaos and anarchy

1116
01:07:00,262 --> 01:07:02,662
and... and sheer...
sheer...

1117
01:07:04,566 --> 01:07:06,397
Golly, now listen to this.

1118
01:07:06,435 --> 01:07:08,403
Listen to this.
Sing this.

1119
01:07:15,277 --> 01:07:17,575
I'm amazed the anticipation
of pulling off

1120
01:07:17,612 --> 01:07:19,011
a mother-daughter
double-dip

1121
01:07:19,047 --> 01:07:21,038
didn't give him
a stroke right there.

1122
01:07:22,751 --> 01:07:24,616
Go ahead. Ready?

1123
01:07:26,788 --> 01:07:30,315
- That we want in college.
- She's a ho, man. She's a ho.

1124
01:07:30,359 --> 01:07:33,192
- Mini.
- Yes, Mr. Bishop?

1125
01:07:33,228 --> 01:07:35,992
I've got a note for you to go to
the principal's office right away.

1126
01:07:36,031 --> 01:07:38,295
- Do you?
- Aww.

1127
01:07:38,333 --> 01:07:41,461
- Hold this. I'll make it fast.
- Mm-hmm. Always do.

1128
01:07:44,139 --> 01:07:46,664
- Detective Garson.
- Hello.

1129
01:07:46,708 --> 01:07:49,176
- What's going on?
- Mini, have a seat.

1130
01:08:00,122 --> 01:08:04,354
Mini, this tape was shot a week
before your mother's death.

1131
01:08:08,597 --> 01:08:12,397
And the next day, the school nurse
reported a bottle of Ritalin

1132
01:08:12,434 --> 01:08:14,459
missing from
the medicine cabinet.

1133
01:08:17,305 --> 01:08:20,570
And we lifted
two sets of prints...

1134
01:08:20,609 --> 01:08:23,806
one from the door, one from the inside
of the medicine cabinet...

1135
01:08:23,845 --> 01:08:27,212
and neither one of them
matches the nurse. Okay?

1136
01:08:28,216 --> 01:08:30,116
Mini...

1137
01:08:30,152 --> 01:08:33,849
is there something
you'd like to say to Detective Garson?

1138
01:08:36,158 --> 01:08:39,218
Can we see the tape of Der Führer
sucking down her afternoon fix of vodka?

1139
01:08:39,261 --> 01:08:41,889
Or do you guys not keep cameras
in the bathroom stalls?

1140
01:08:41,930 --> 01:08:43,659
Don't you dare do that!

1141
01:08:43,698 --> 01:08:46,030
Don't you dare
try to deflect this!

1142
01:08:46,068 --> 01:08:48,468
Stealing, if no one
ever told you,

1143
01:08:48,503 --> 01:08:50,130
is a serious matter!

1144
01:08:50,172 --> 01:08:55,007
Stealing prescription drugs
from a school is a very serious matter!

1145
01:08:58,747 --> 01:09:01,181
You got me, okay?

1146
01:09:01,216 --> 01:09:03,707
- But what was I supposed to do?
- What does that mean?

1147
01:09:03,752 --> 01:09:06,846
- Well, she said if I didn't...
- Who s... who, another student?

1148
01:09:06,888 --> 01:09:09,322
No, my mother.
She made me steal them for her.

1149
01:09:09,357 --> 01:09:12,053
I didn't want to, but she said she was
going to send me to boarding school

1150
01:09:12,094 --> 01:09:14,028
- in Canada if I didn't.
- Canada?

1151
01:09:14,062 --> 01:09:16,087
The Yukon Territories.

1152
01:09:16,131 --> 01:09:18,429
Are you happy now?

1153
01:09:20,335 --> 01:09:23,133
Oh my Lord,
I had no idea.

1154
01:09:24,473 --> 01:09:27,670
- She was...
- What? What, an addict?

1155
01:09:27,709 --> 01:09:29,870
Detective Garson knew.

1156
01:09:32,380 --> 01:09:34,940
My mommy's dead, okay?
Can't we just let her be?

1157
01:09:37,486 --> 01:09:39,351
Detective Garson.

1158
01:09:40,489 --> 01:09:42,548
I assume there won't
be any need

1159
01:09:42,591 --> 01:09:45,151
to press charges
against Ms. Drogues?

1160
01:09:49,931 --> 01:09:52,866
Oh, hey, Mr. Tannen.
I was actually just coming to see you.

1161
01:09:52,901 --> 01:09:54,266
Have you got a minute?

1162
01:09:54,302 --> 01:09:57,203
Detective, I thought I said no more
questions without my lawyer.

1163
01:09:57,239 --> 01:10:00,072
Yeah, um, I think
you'd better call him.

1164
01:10:03,979 --> 01:10:08,075
Yeah, so there's
a small discrepancy

1165
01:10:08,116 --> 01:10:12,815
I couldn't quite figure it out, and I
was hoping maybe you could explain it.

1166
01:10:12,854 --> 01:10:15,152
- I suppose I can try.
- Okay.

1167
01:10:15,190 --> 01:10:18,353
Yeah, we got the final
toxicology report

1168
01:10:18,393 --> 01:10:21,226
and your wife definitely didn't
die from the pills.

1169
01:10:21,263 --> 01:10:23,754
She wasn't conscious
past 9:30,

1170
01:10:23,798 --> 01:10:27,165
but it was the fumes
that killed her.

1171
01:10:27,202 --> 01:10:29,670
Hallelujah.

1172
01:10:29,704 --> 01:10:31,797
- Thanks for the update.
- Martin, Martin, easy.

1173
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:34,001
- Come on, this is harassment here.
- Just... please.

1174
01:10:34,042 --> 01:10:36,772
Well, see, here's what
I wanted to ask.

1175
01:10:36,811 --> 01:10:39,678
The gas tank in the Jag
was almost completely full,

1176
01:10:39,714 --> 01:10:41,841
only about a gallon
of fuel had been used.

1177
01:10:41,883 --> 01:10:43,350
And?

1178
01:10:43,385 --> 01:10:47,321
Well, if she was
unconscious by 9:30,

1179
01:10:47,355 --> 01:10:50,654
that means that the car would've been
running for at least two hours

1180
01:10:50,692 --> 01:10:52,683
by the time you found her,

1181
01:10:52,727 --> 01:10:55,423
and an unconscious person
can't turn on a car, right?

1182
01:10:55,463 --> 01:10:59,024
Detective, with all due
respect, could you get to the point?

1183
01:10:59,067 --> 01:11:01,399
That's the part where I get kind
of confused, you see.

1184
01:11:01,436 --> 01:11:06,339
In that model Jaguar, if you were
to leave it idling for two hours,

1185
01:11:06,374 --> 01:11:10,003
it would burn at least
four gallons of fuel.

1186
01:11:10,045 --> 01:11:11,706
You see?

1187
01:11:13,915 --> 01:11:17,908
So, it doesn't... it doesn't really seem
like there's any way

1188
01:11:17,953 --> 01:11:21,514
that the gas tank
could be full

1189
01:11:21,556 --> 01:11:24,252
if it had been running
for two hours.

1190
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:27,421
Right?

1191
01:11:27,462 --> 01:11:29,953
So I guess, you know,

1192
01:11:29,998 --> 01:11:32,796
what I'm asking is,
you know,

1193
01:11:32,834 --> 01:11:35,394
whose idea was
to put her in the car?

1194
01:11:35,437 --> 01:11:37,803
Martin, Martin.
Don't... don't say anything.

1195
01:11:37,839 --> 01:11:39,898
Look, Mr. Tannen.

1196
01:11:39,941 --> 01:11:43,809
I know that you're the person that has
the most to gain from your wife's death.

1197
01:11:43,845 --> 01:11:48,111
But I've also learned
from talking to her friends

1198
01:11:48,149 --> 01:11:50,674
that she and Mini had a pretty
strained relationship.

1199
01:11:50,719 --> 01:11:53,051
Uh, excuse me,
what's your first name again?

1200
01:11:53,088 --> 01:11:56,057
- It's Dwight.
- Listen, Dwight.

1201
01:11:56,091 --> 01:11:57,991
Do I look like the kind of guy who's
going to allow my client

1202
01:11:58,026 --> 01:12:00,051
to sit here and listen to these
questions in these circumstances?

1203
01:12:00,095 --> 01:12:02,689
Don't insult
my intelligence, Dwight.

1204
01:12:02,731 --> 01:12:05,427
- Just cut to the chase.
- Okay, I'd just like for Mr. Tannen

1205
01:12:05,467 --> 01:12:07,594
to know that if he's trying
to be a protective father

1206
01:12:07,636 --> 01:12:09,831
by covering up something
Mini might have done,

1207
01:12:09,871 --> 01:12:12,806
I'd really think twice about it.
I really would.

1208
01:12:12,841 --> 01:12:15,901
'Cause the D.A. In this case,
he's viewing it, you know,

1209
01:12:15,944 --> 01:12:18,003
as kind of an opportunity
to show the public

1210
01:12:18,046 --> 01:12:20,344
that the rich can't get away
with murder in this town.

1211
01:12:30,292 --> 01:12:32,726
Does this mean that he's
offering Mr. Tannen immunity

1212
01:12:32,761 --> 01:12:35,093
if he says he was
protecting his daughter?

1213
01:12:37,565 --> 01:12:40,159
Yeah, that's
a strong possibility.

1214
01:12:40,201 --> 01:12:43,864
But he also wants Mr. Tannen to know
that if he doesn't do it,

1215
01:12:43,905 --> 01:12:46,237
he's going to go
for the maximum sentence.

1216
01:12:46,274 --> 01:12:49,437
No manslaughter,
no plea bargain.

1217
01:12:50,445 --> 01:12:52,208
Nothing.

1218
01:12:52,247 --> 01:12:55,444
It was Colonel Mustard
in the library with the candlestick.

1219
01:12:55,483 --> 01:12:57,781
Ms. Drogues,
as your lawyer, I think...

1220
01:12:57,819 --> 01:13:00,310
Don't wet your pants.
I know when to shut up.

1221
01:13:00,355 --> 01:13:02,687
And swallow.

1222
01:13:02,724 --> 01:13:06,956
Look. The fact that
the marriage was unhappy

1223
01:13:06,995 --> 01:13:08,860
and that there
was no prenup,

1224
01:13:08,897 --> 01:13:11,627
that gives all of the motive
to Martin, okay?

1225
01:13:11,666 --> 01:13:15,568
- So you want me to say it was his idea?
- Well, if it was his idea,

1226
01:13:15,603 --> 01:13:18,697
can you give me one good reason
why you should take the fall?

1227
01:13:24,446 --> 01:13:27,347
So you're saying if I tell
the jury it was his idea,

1228
01:13:27,382 --> 01:13:29,748
and I was scared for my life
because he said he'd kill me

1229
01:13:29,784 --> 01:13:32,514
if I ever told anyone,
that I walk?

1230
01:13:36,191 --> 01:13:37,681
Sst!

1231
01:13:41,529 --> 01:13:44,726
Sorry, sport,
but I'll take my chances.

1232
01:13:49,671 --> 01:13:52,765
I never doubted for a moment
you were gonna hold firm,

1233
01:13:52,807 --> 01:13:54,934
not for a second.
I hope you know that.

1234
01:13:55,944 --> 01:13:58,504
- You know that?
- Yeah.

1235
01:13:59,547 --> 01:14:01,276
Good.

1236
01:14:01,316 --> 01:14:04,752
You realize we're going to have to learn
to rely on each other?

1237
01:14:04,786 --> 01:14:07,050
I have only
one concern now.

1238
01:14:07,088 --> 01:14:08,749
What?

1239
01:14:09,791 --> 01:14:11,622
Rudell.

1240
01:14:11,659 --> 01:14:15,288
If a jury finds out we're a couple,
then we both have a motive.

1241
01:14:15,330 --> 01:14:18,094
And that
changes everything.

1242
01:14:19,534 --> 01:14:22,503
Don't worry about him, baby.
He's just jealous.

1243
01:14:22,537 --> 01:14:24,164
Even if he did send
that picture,

1244
01:14:24,205 --> 01:14:27,504
what does it prove?
Nothing.

1245
01:14:36,317 --> 01:14:39,218
Oh hey, come and watch.
Come on, you're missing... I'm on TV.

1246
01:14:39,254 --> 01:14:41,916
What? Why?

1247
01:14:41,956 --> 01:14:43,821
Hurry up, the commercial's
almost over.

1248
01:14:43,858 --> 01:14:46,452
Welcome back to "Absolutely Positive."

1249
01:14:46,494 --> 01:14:50,453
Now it's time to hear how the date
between Jason and Mini ended.

1250
01:14:50,498 --> 01:14:53,228
- Jason, you said...
- You went on this...

1251
01:14:53,268 --> 01:14:54,735
Shh! Yeah, I thought
it'd be a gas.

1252
01:14:54,769 --> 01:14:57,704
...to test your ability
to resist temptation?

1253
01:14:59,507 --> 01:15:04,137
Um, well, since Becky and I
have dated since high school,

1254
01:15:04,179 --> 01:15:09,549
and we decided to remain
virgins until marriage,

1255
01:15:09,584 --> 01:15:12,382
I wanted to go
on another date

1256
01:15:12,420 --> 01:15:15,651
with another girl just to...
to see how I would react,

1257
01:15:15,690 --> 01:15:18,716
you know, to see
if there were any doubts

1258
01:15:18,760 --> 01:15:20,728
- about my decision.
- Hmm.

1259
01:15:20,762 --> 01:15:22,923
So after dinner,
what happened?

1260
01:15:22,964 --> 01:15:28,231
Um, well, she suggested
this dance club that she knew.

1261
01:15:28,269 --> 01:15:31,761
I'm not really a good dancer,
but I said yes.

1262
01:15:31,806 --> 01:15:34,798
- We never go dancing.
- Mini, Jason a good dancer?

1263
01:15:34,843 --> 01:15:37,004
Well, he's a
damn quick learner.

1264
01:15:37,045 --> 01:15:39,070
Not just at dancing.

1265
01:15:39,113 --> 01:15:42,310
Oh, you mean there was some other
teacher-student stuff going on?

1266
01:15:42,350 --> 01:15:43,817
No, not really.

1267
01:15:43,852 --> 01:15:45,410
What about when we
went back to your place?

1268
01:15:45,453 --> 01:15:48,217
- You what?
- That's... that's not true.

1269
01:15:48,256 --> 01:15:51,248
- Why are you doing this?
- Why are you being so shy?

1270
01:15:51,292 --> 01:15:53,055
- Jason?
- We turned on some music,

1271
01:15:53,094 --> 01:15:56,029
- we started kissing.
- Shut up!

1272
01:15:56,064 --> 01:15:58,498
But, JJ, you said
it was special.

1273
01:15:58,533 --> 01:16:01,832
You... you slept with her?!

1274
01:16:01,870 --> 01:16:04,805
- No. No!
- To say the least.

1275
01:16:04,839 --> 01:16:08,502
- You slept with him?
- God, Martin, it was a one-time thing.

1276
01:16:08,543 --> 01:16:11,910
Put it this way: You're in for a wild
ride from this bronco.

1277
01:16:11,946 --> 01:16:13,914
He was a virgin,
how could I say no?

1278
01:16:13,948 --> 01:16:17,475
It won't happen again, okay?
I promise. He was just a goof.

1279
01:16:17,519 --> 01:16:19,919
Yeah, JJ, tell us more!

1280
01:16:21,022 --> 01:16:23,616
Rudell.
He let you go on there?

1281
01:16:23,658 --> 01:16:25,649
Yeah, I thought
it'd be fun.

1282
01:16:25,693 --> 01:16:27,718
I mean, I wasn't really
supposed to, you know,

1283
01:16:27,762 --> 01:16:29,457
go all the way
with him, but...

1284
01:16:29,497 --> 01:16:31,692
I can't believe you.

1285
01:16:31,733 --> 01:16:34,998
That couple, you've ruined
their relationship.

1286
01:16:35,036 --> 01:16:38,005
The show is called
"Absolutely Positive" for a reason.

1287
01:16:38,039 --> 01:16:40,667
Clearly the only thing
Jason was positive about

1288
01:16:40,708 --> 01:16:42,972
was, uh... yeah.

1289
01:16:44,712 --> 01:16:48,079
You really are a sick
little twist, you know that?

1290
01:16:49,551 --> 01:16:51,542
Well, what does
that make you?

1291
01:16:57,725 --> 01:16:59,716
I need some air.

1292
01:17:02,897 --> 01:17:05,058
By the way, some intern
from your office

1293
01:17:05,099 --> 01:17:07,192
stopped by earlier today
with something.

1294
01:17:07,235 --> 01:17:09,669
It's on the bar.

1295
01:17:19,581 --> 01:17:21,412
What is it?

1296
01:17:26,554 --> 01:17:29,853
I think it's time I had a little chat
with our neighbor.

1297
01:17:29,891 --> 01:17:32,724
No, this is exactly
what he wants.

1298
01:17:32,760 --> 01:17:34,455
What if he's working
with Garson?

1299
01:17:34,495 --> 01:17:36,622
Then he can't blackmail me.
I want you to wait here.

1300
01:17:36,664 --> 01:17:38,825
- I'll be right back in a minute.
- Let me go with you.

1301
01:17:38,866 --> 01:17:41,630
- I said wait here.
- Let me just talk to him, okay?

1302
01:17:41,669 --> 01:17:45,571
- He promised me he wouldn't hurt us.
- Oh, he did?

1303
01:17:45,607 --> 01:17:48,167
- When?
- A few days ago.

1304
01:17:48,209 --> 01:17:49,904
- You saw him?
- Yeah,

1305
01:17:49,944 --> 01:17:52,344
I went to try to find out what he knew.
I spent the afternoon with him.

1306
01:17:52,380 --> 01:17:53,972
You spent the afternoon
with him?

1307
01:17:54,015 --> 01:17:55,380
I was doing it for us.

1308
01:17:55,416 --> 01:17:57,782
I figured he wouldn't
turn us in if...

1309
01:17:57,819 --> 01:17:59,446
If you what?!

1310
01:17:59,487 --> 01:18:02,923
If I made him think I was interested.

1311
01:18:06,260 --> 01:18:09,525
- Please tell me that you didn't.
- No.

1312
01:18:10,531 --> 01:18:12,396
No.

1313
01:18:12,433 --> 01:18:15,425
I just made him think that I would,
so that he wouldn't turn us in.

1314
01:18:15,470 --> 01:18:17,836
Thank you.

1315
01:18:17,872 --> 01:18:19,965
I appreciate
your restraint.

1316
01:18:20,008 --> 01:18:22,568
You ungrateful
son of a bitch.

1317
01:18:22,610 --> 01:18:25,443
I'd think you'd be a little more
appreciative. I was doing it for us.

1318
01:18:25,480 --> 01:18:28,574
For us? And who were
you doing it for

1319
01:18:28,616 --> 01:18:30,846
when you were doing it
with the kid on that show?!

1320
01:18:30,885 --> 01:18:33,854
Who was that
selfless act for?!

1321
01:18:33,888 --> 01:18:37,380
Oh, like you're such
a martyr for being faithful.

1322
01:18:37,425 --> 01:18:41,452
It shows amazing restraint to limit
yourself to just one stepdaughter.

1323
01:18:43,431 --> 01:18:46,161
Don't lecture me
about infidelity.

1324
01:18:46,200 --> 01:18:49,135
Your mother was cheating
on me within six months

1325
01:18:49,170 --> 01:18:51,001
of the "I do's."

1326
01:18:51,039 --> 01:18:54,270
- If you'll excuse me...
- Okay, look. I'm sorry.

1327
01:18:54,308 --> 01:18:56,276
- Let go of me.
- You're making a mistake,

1328
01:18:56,310 --> 01:18:59,143
- trust me.
- I said let go of me.

1329
01:18:59,180 --> 01:19:01,478
You're hurting me.

1330
01:19:01,516 --> 01:19:04,644
Now you wait here until I get back.
Do you understand?

1331
01:19:06,087 --> 01:19:08,453
Say "Yes, Martin."

1332
01:19:08,489 --> 01:19:10,184
Yes, Martin.

1333
01:19:25,640 --> 01:19:28,404
Martin.
What a surprise.

1334
01:19:28,443 --> 01:19:32,311
- How are you?
- I just saw Mini on your show.

1335
01:19:32,346 --> 01:19:34,541
Oh, was...
was tonight the night?

1336
01:19:34,582 --> 01:19:37,551
You know, I auditioned
lots of girls,

1337
01:19:37,585 --> 01:19:42,022
and she was, uh,
fucking incredible.

1338
01:19:42,056 --> 01:19:44,149
Uh-huh.
A real natural, huh?

1339
01:19:44,192 --> 01:19:46,524
Yeah, like a duck
takes to water.

1340
01:19:46,561 --> 01:19:48,756
Totally...

1341
01:19:48,796 --> 01:19:50,855
willing to take
direction.

1342
01:19:50,898 --> 01:19:54,265
I wish all the girls
I worked with had her, uh...

1343
01:19:54,302 --> 01:19:56,270
how can I put this?

1344
01:19:57,438 --> 01:20:00,737
...need to please.
- Oh.

1345
01:20:00,775 --> 01:20:02,766
Hi, I need the police
sent right away

1346
01:20:02,810 --> 01:20:05,301
to 25051 Mira Loma Lane.

1347
01:20:10,651 --> 01:20:11,948
No!

1348
01:20:15,223 --> 01:20:17,953
You motherfucker!

1349
01:20:34,642 --> 01:20:36,473
Ow ow ow ow!

1350
01:20:54,729 --> 01:20:56,822
Where are they, huh?

1351
01:20:56,864 --> 01:20:59,264
What are you
talking about?

1352
01:20:59,300 --> 01:21:01,461
Don't fuck with me...
the negatives, where are they?

1353
01:21:01,502 --> 01:21:03,094
What?

1354
01:21:13,114 --> 01:21:16,208
How do you like that,
you son of a bitch, huh?

1355
01:21:18,319 --> 01:21:20,184
You thought you could
have my wife,

1356
01:21:20,221 --> 01:21:21,984
then my daughter?

1357
01:21:22,023 --> 01:21:23,650
Well, I'm sorry, pal.

1358
01:21:24,725 --> 01:21:26,590
She's mine.

1359
01:21:29,797 --> 01:21:32,698
Okay, you listen to me,
you son of a bitch,

1360
01:21:32,733 --> 01:21:35,668
you give me those negatives
or, so help me God,

1361
01:21:35,703 --> 01:21:38,035
I'm gonna crack
your head open!

1362
01:21:38,072 --> 01:21:39,596
Let him go!

1363
01:21:39,640 --> 01:21:41,369
- Go get the negatives.
- No, this is insane!

1364
01:21:41,409 --> 01:21:43,240
- Stop! No stop!
- I need those negatives.

1365
01:21:43,277 --> 01:21:45,040
You're gonna kill him!
Stop!

1366
01:21:45,079 --> 01:21:47,240
What the hell is wrong with you?
He's gonna tell everybody!

1367
01:21:47,281 --> 01:21:48,908
Freeze!
Sheriff's Department!

1368
01:21:48,950 --> 01:21:51,885
- Drop the club!
- He's crazy. I told him to stop.

1369
01:21:51,919 --> 01:21:53,887
I told him.

1370
01:22:19,280 --> 01:22:22,306
With Rudell having slipped
into a coma after the fight,

1371
01:22:22,350 --> 01:22:24,818
and Garson uncovering
my mom's affair with him,

1372
01:22:24,852 --> 01:22:29,084
suddenly that gas-gauge theory
went from circumstantial to airtight.

1373
01:22:29,123 --> 01:22:31,148
Martin realized trying
to pin anything on me

1374
01:22:31,192 --> 01:22:33,023
would probably
get him the chair.

1375
01:22:33,060 --> 01:22:35,426
At his sentencing,
I begged for leniency.

1376
01:22:50,278 --> 01:22:51,870
- Hey!
- Hey.

1377
01:22:51,913 --> 01:22:54,507
- I'm sorry I'm late.
- It's okay.

1378
01:22:54,548 --> 01:22:56,641
I forgot to bring
that book you wanted.

1379
01:22:56,684 --> 01:22:58,345
It's all right.
You can mail it to me.

1380
01:23:00,254 --> 01:23:03,553
Are you okay? Have you showered
since you've been in here?

1381
01:23:03,591 --> 01:23:05,218
Uh-huh.

1382
01:23:05,259 --> 01:23:08,092
You know, in here you
gotta be careful when you...

1383
01:23:08,129 --> 01:23:09,494
so how's school?

1384
01:23:09,530 --> 01:23:11,327
Oh my God, you'll never
guess what happened.

1385
01:23:11,365 --> 01:23:14,266
- What happened?
- As many of you know,

1386
01:23:14,302 --> 01:23:16,702
the past few months of my life
have been very difficult.

1387
01:23:16,737 --> 01:23:19,570
I don't know how I would've gotten
through it without all of you.

1388
01:23:19,607 --> 01:23:22,576
I really think it's a testament
to the love in this institution

1389
01:23:22,610 --> 01:23:24,202
that I stand before you today

1390
01:23:24,245 --> 01:23:26,611
as the first straight-C student
in school history

1391
01:23:26,647 --> 01:23:28,581
to be voted
valedictorian.

1392
01:23:28,616 --> 01:23:30,880
- But don't you have to be...
- The best student? I know.

1393
01:23:30,918 --> 01:23:34,319
But the students voted and they said
they wanted me to have it

1394
01:23:34,355 --> 01:23:37,415
for..."demonstrating
remarkable courage

1395
01:23:37,458 --> 01:23:39,085
in the face
of unspeakable loss."

1396
01:23:39,126 --> 01:23:41,117
Huh.

1397
01:23:41,162 --> 01:23:44,427
Wow, I wonder how the real
valedictorian must feel about that.

1398
01:23:44,465 --> 01:23:46,160
Again to Marvin Tepperman,

1399
01:23:46,200 --> 01:23:47,929
the real valedictorian,

1400
01:23:47,969 --> 01:23:51,370
he deserved this and I want to wish
him a speedy recovery.

1401
01:23:52,440 --> 01:23:53,668
I spoke
to his doctors today

1402
01:23:53,708 --> 01:23:55,335
and they say
with medication and therapy,

1403
01:23:55,376 --> 01:23:57,469
Marvin should be able
to attend Harvard this fall.

1404
01:23:57,511 --> 01:23:59,672
Did Rudell come out
of his coma yet?

1405
01:23:59,714 --> 01:24:02,114
I don't know. Why?

1406
01:24:02,149 --> 01:24:04,913
Why? Because if
he recovers,

1407
01:24:04,952 --> 01:24:06,920
he could blackmail you
with those pictures.

1408
01:24:06,954 --> 01:24:09,650
I wouldn't worry
about that.

1409
01:24:09,690 --> 01:24:12,352
Yeah, but if the DA
got those pictures, he could...

1410
01:24:12,393 --> 01:24:15,260
I'm pretty sure he won't be
doing anything with them.

1411
01:24:15,296 --> 01:24:18,459
I have met some people in here
who can help us with him

1412
01:24:18,499 --> 01:24:20,126
if it comes down
to that.

1413
01:24:20,167 --> 01:24:22,397
- Help us?
- Well, they know people on the outside

1414
01:24:22,436 --> 01:24:25,564
that we could pay to stop him
from taking advantage of you.

1415
01:24:25,606 --> 01:24:27,836
Oh, that's so romantic!

1416
01:24:27,875 --> 01:24:31,003
It's like you're a real-life criminal
with connections and everything,

1417
01:24:31,045 --> 01:24:34,105
but I'm a little surprised
you haven't figured it out yet.

1418
01:24:34,148 --> 01:24:35,945
Figured what out?

1419
01:24:37,351 --> 01:24:40,445
Rudell didn't send
those pictures.

1420
01:24:42,456 --> 01:24:45,755
- You remember Aurelio?
- Aurelio?

1421
01:24:45,793 --> 01:24:48,353
- Our cabana boy from Mexico.
- Uh-huh.

1422
01:24:48,396 --> 01:24:50,421
Yeah, what a sweetie.

1423
01:24:50,464 --> 01:24:51,897
I thought I might
have to fuck him,

1424
01:24:51,932 --> 01:24:53,729
but just giving him
the camera was enough.

1425
01:24:56,537 --> 01:24:58,437
You mean that you...

1426
01:24:58,472 --> 01:25:00,565
While I may not have excelled
in the classroom,

1427
01:25:00,608 --> 01:25:02,405
I think that
my recent experiences

1428
01:25:02,443 --> 01:25:04,468
in that bigger schoolhouse
we call life

1429
01:25:04,512 --> 01:25:07,504
has taught me a few lessons that I'd
like to share with my fellow graduates.

1430
01:25:07,548 --> 01:25:10,176
Martin, it was pretty clear
Garson wasn't gonna give up,

1431
01:25:10,217 --> 01:25:13,243
and sooner or later
he'd find enough to charge us.

1432
01:25:13,287 --> 01:25:16,620
It just seemed ridiculous that we'd
both end up suffering.

1433
01:25:16,657 --> 01:25:18,716
How could you
do this to me?!

1434
01:25:18,759 --> 01:25:20,659
Follow your heart
and don't question it

1435
01:25:20,694 --> 01:25:22,321
no matter where
it tells you to go.

1436
01:25:22,363 --> 01:25:24,831
Come on, you would have
done it if you'd thought of it first.

1437
01:25:24,865 --> 01:25:27,493
Why the fuck did you
do this to me?!

1438
01:25:27,535 --> 01:25:30,834
Trust me, it'll open up a world of new
experiences you can't even imagine.

1439
01:25:30,871 --> 01:25:32,839
Hey, listen,
since conjugal visits are

1440
01:25:32,873 --> 01:25:35,239
pretty much
out of the question,

1441
01:25:35,276 --> 01:25:38,074
I was thinking maybe we could try
a little prison phone sex.

1442
01:25:38,112 --> 01:25:40,546
You know, I might even
be able to pop one out right here

1443
01:25:40,581 --> 01:25:42,572
without anyone seeing.
Are you ready?

1444
01:25:42,616 --> 01:25:43,810
- Guard!
- Are you sure?

1445
01:25:43,851 --> 01:25:45,409
I won't be able
to come back for a few weeks.

1446
01:25:45,453 --> 01:25:47,887
Don't forget your family,
your parents.

1447
01:25:47,922 --> 01:25:50,516
- Wait, have you met someone in here?
- Guard!

1448
01:25:50,558 --> 01:25:52,025
Don't forget they're people too,

1449
01:25:52,059 --> 01:25:53,287
and while you may not always
agree with them...

1450
01:25:53,327 --> 01:25:56,592
Why, you old dog! I knew you wouldn't
be single in here for long.

1451
01:25:56,630 --> 01:25:58,359
...remember to love them
when they need love.

1452
01:25:58,399 --> 01:26:00,526
Guard, she did it!
She just admitted it!

1453
01:26:00,568 --> 01:26:02,058
And I mean
really love them.

1454
01:26:02,103 --> 01:26:03,536
Don't just pay them
lip service.

1455
01:26:03,571 --> 01:26:05,903
It was her idea!
It was your fucking idea!

1456
01:26:05,940 --> 01:26:08,374
- Really do it whenever you can.
- Don't let her leave!

1457
01:26:08,409 --> 01:26:10,741
She's guilty! Get the warden!
What the fuck are you...

1458
01:26:10,778 --> 01:26:14,270
- I know I did.
- You little fuckin' whore!

1459
01:26:14,315 --> 01:26:16,943
I'm gonna kill you,
you little fuckin' bitch!

1460
01:26:16,984 --> 01:26:18,713
Get down!

1461
01:26:18,752 --> 01:26:21,585
And I just wish that
my dad could be here today,

1462
01:26:21,622 --> 01:26:24,022
so that after this speech,
I could walk into the audience

1463
01:26:24,058 --> 01:26:26,322
and give him my love right here
in front of all of you.

1464
01:26:26,360 --> 01:26:29,557
Come here!
Motherfucking...

1465
01:26:29,597 --> 01:26:31,224
Thank you
and good luck.

1466
01:26:44,378 --> 01:26:46,812
Hmm, persistent,
isn't he?

1467
01:26:46,847 --> 01:26:50,283
The truth is I wouldn't mind
being cuffed by him,

1468
01:26:50,317 --> 01:26:52,547
and he would be
my first detective.

1469
01:27:04,465 --> 01:27:07,161
Like I promised...
with desire,

1470
01:27:07,201 --> 01:27:11,137
focus and the willingness
to treat any obstacle as an opportunity,

1471
01:27:11,172 --> 01:27:13,697
it's amazing
what you can accomplish.

1472
01:27:13,741 --> 01:27:15,709
And in case
you're feeling guilty

1473
01:27:15,743 --> 01:27:20,043
about having no one
to identify with but me, relax.

1474
01:27:20,080 --> 01:27:22,207
There's a first time
for everything.
