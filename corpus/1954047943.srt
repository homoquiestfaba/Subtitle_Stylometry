1
00:00:25,458 --> 00:00:28,594
I was having the weirdest dream.

2
00:00:28,596 --> 00:00:31,797
For some reason,

3
00:00:31,799 --> 00:00:36,802
Busta Rhymes was holding me
hostage at gunpoint.

4
00:00:36,804 --> 00:00:40,639
And it was making me late

5
00:00:40,641 --> 00:00:43,075
for our wedding rehearsal
in Queens.

6
00:00:43,077 --> 00:00:44,076
(Chuckling)

7
00:00:44,078 --> 00:00:45,744
We're getting married?

8
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:48,781
In the dream.

9
00:00:48,783 --> 00:00:53,485
So, somehow, I managed to escape

10
00:00:53,487 --> 00:00:57,790
and make it back
to my parents' house.

11
00:00:57,792 --> 00:01:02,494
But then I realized

12
00:01:02,496 --> 00:01:04,797
I didn't know
which shoes to wear.

13
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:09,535
So, I just grabbed a bunch.

14
00:01:09,537 --> 00:01:13,672
And then I was running through
Prospect Park to get to Queens.

15
00:01:13,674 --> 00:01:15,774
Prospect Park's in Brooklyn.

16
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:19,411
I know. But it's a dream.

17
00:01:19,413 --> 00:01:23,515
You know, like,
it's dream logic or something.

18
00:01:23,517 --> 00:01:25,751
I don't dream.

19
00:01:25,753 --> 00:01:27,786
Shut up.

20
00:01:27,788 --> 00:01:30,289
That's why I burn.

21
00:01:30,291 --> 00:01:34,660
No, that's why you
don't remember your dreams.

22
00:01:34,662 --> 00:01:38,397
So, you were running
through Prospect Park...

23
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:44,403
I was running.

24
00:01:44,405 --> 00:01:46,171
And, uhh, and...

25
00:01:46,173 --> 00:01:52,611
(Laughing)

26
00:01:52,613 --> 00:01:54,613

27
00:01:54,615 --> 00:01:58,250
I don't speak Spanish. No
Spanish.

28
00:01:58,252 --> 00:01:59,785
Look, can I have some
"D" batteries, please?

29

(Speaking Spanish)

30
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:11,563
Can I have a bag?

31
00:02:11,565 --> 00:02:15,234
Yo, let me get a couple coffees,
man, four sugar.

32
00:02:15,236 --> 00:02:17,369
I'll be back.

33
00:02:17,371 --> 00:02:18,737
Thank you.

34
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:25,878
Grilled chicken sandwich.
Thanks.

35
00:02:34,187 --> 00:02:35,821
(Door closing)

36
00:02:35,823 --> 00:02:37,756
Lyle, you got to slam
the fucking door?

37
00:02:37,758 --> 00:02:39,525
See what we got here.

38
00:02:39,527 --> 00:02:43,362
Stereo and a couch.

39
00:02:45,298 --> 00:02:49,601
Dude, this fucking eczema's
killing me.

40
00:02:49,603 --> 00:02:51,570
Yo.

41
00:02:51,572 --> 00:02:53,172
You think you might roll
the window down?

42
00:02:53,174 --> 00:02:54,573
Give me a second.

43
00:02:54,575 --> 00:02:56,475
Maybe before you
fucking light it.

44
00:02:56,477 --> 00:02:58,744
Can't do that and light it.

45
00:02:58,746 --> 00:03:00,445
We're good. We're good.
We're good.

46
00:03:00,447 --> 00:03:02,414
You put your fucking
jerk-off pants on today.

47
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:04,483
Always wear my jerk-off pants.

48
00:03:04,485 --> 00:03:06,285
Come on,
I got a fucking piss test.

49
00:03:06,287 --> 00:03:07,920
Can you roll it down
a little more?

50
00:03:07,922 --> 00:03:10,856
Yo, you see this motherfucker?

51
00:03:10,858 --> 00:03:13,258
Oh, shit.

52
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:15,227
Remember doing shit like that
when you were a kid?

53
00:03:15,229 --> 00:03:17,229
What?

54

Oh yeah, you don't drink.

56

You're, like, Muslim or
something, right?

57
00:03:23,604 --> 00:03:28,974

The time difference alone

224
00:11:58,318 --> 00:12:03,154

whole body's chemistry.

225

227
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:15,900

when we're in India,

What?

889
00:47:17,035 --> 00:47:18,100
Yeah, man.

890
00:47:18,102 --> 00:47:21,070
No, I know. But... It's going to
cost you ten bones.

891
00:47:21,072 --> 00:47:22,271
I don't want it.

892
00:47:22,273 --> 00:47:23,372
I'll tell you what though.

893
00:47:23,374 --> 00:47:24,373
Calm down.

894
00:47:24,375 --> 00:47:25,374
$8, $8.

895
00:47:25,376 --> 00:47:26,375
No, just leave me alone.

896
00:47:26,377 --> 00:47:27,844
I'm just going to need eight.

897
00:47:27,846 --> 00:47:30,613
No, man. Look. Here, here.
All right, here.

898
00:47:30,615 --> 00:47:31,948
There's $5, man.

899
00:47:31,950 --> 00:47:34,417
Yeah, just leave me alone,
please, man.

900
00:47:34,419 --> 00:47:35,418
Take the shit.

901
00:47:35,420 --> 00:47:36,619
I don't want that.

902
00:47:36,621 --> 00:47:37,620
All right, all right.

903
00:47:37,622 --> 00:47:40,623
Motherfuckers nowadays
don't appreciate shit.

904
00:47:40,625 --> 00:47:43,993
I do appreciate it.
Thank you.

905
00:47:43,995 --> 00:47:47,496
(Coughing)

906
00:47:47,498 --> 00:47:50,066
Make it rain up in here.

907
00:47:50,068 --> 00:47:55,104
(Coughing)

908
00:48:01,078 --> 00:48:05,448
Excuse me.
Can we get some water in here?

909
00:48:05,450 --> 00:48:07,316
MAN:
Ask your arresting officer.

910
00:48:07,318 --> 00:48:10,319
It's not for me.
There's a sick man in here.

911
00:48:10,321 --> 00:48:12,188
You ain't hear him
over here coughing?

912
00:48:12,190 --> 00:48:14,657
Jesus Christ.

913
00:48:14,659 --> 00:48:17,627
(Coughing)

914
00:48:17,629 --> 00:48:20,396
PHILLY:
What is $5 going to get me?

915
00:48:20,398 --> 00:48:21,330
Thank you.

916
00:48:21,332 --> 00:48:22,331
Let me just get a little kiss.

917
00:48:22,333 --> 00:48:26,168
Come on, baby. Let me play with
them gristles a little bit.

918
00:48:26,170 --> 00:48:28,237
(Coughing)

919
00:48:28,239 --> 00:48:31,540
I can't get shit?

920
00:48:31,542 --> 00:48:33,542
(Coughing)

921
00:48:45,389 --> 00:48:49,558
Gracias.

922
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:52,094
(Coughing)

923
00:49:07,611 --> 00:49:09,578
(Door opening)

924
00:49:13,650 --> 00:49:18,654
(Door closing)

925
00:49:18,656 --> 00:49:22,725
Yo. I got locked up last night.

926
00:49:22,727 --> 00:49:27,096
It's a long story.

927
00:49:27,098 --> 00:49:29,265
Stay right here. Let me just...

928
00:49:29,267 --> 00:49:32,468
Let me just get
my shit together, please.

929
00:49:44,247 --> 00:49:45,281
Yo, where you going?

930
00:49:45,283 --> 00:49:46,615
Get out of my way!

931
00:49:46,617 --> 00:49:47,616
Really?

932
00:49:47,618 --> 00:49:48,617
Move!

933
00:49:48,619 --> 00:49:52,722
And you didn't answer
any of my phone calls!

934
00:49:52,724 --> 00:49:54,156
Yo, you need to calm down.

935
00:49:54,158 --> 00:49:56,025
I don't want to talk
to you anymore! I'm out!

936
00:49:56,027 --> 00:49:57,293
Yo, you need to talk to me.

937
00:49:57,295 --> 00:49:59,128
You gon' walk
out there like that?

938
00:49:59,130 --> 00:50:00,129
Yes!

939
00:50:00,131 --> 00:50:01,230
No, that's fucked up.

940
00:50:01,232 --> 00:50:02,498
What are you talking about?

941
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:04,333
It's fucked up that I been
calling you all night!

942
00:50:04,335 --> 00:50:06,335
And you haven't answered
any of my phone calls!

943
00:50:06,337 --> 00:50:07,470
You listen to me--

944
00:50:07,472 --> 00:50:08,704
I don't want to talk to you.

945
00:50:08,706 --> 00:50:10,306
Yo, let me just--
Let me make it better.

946
00:50:10,308 --> 00:50:13,042
You can't make it better, Lyle.

947
00:50:13,044 --> 00:50:14,043
Why you screaming at me?

948
00:50:14,045 --> 00:50:16,445
You can't make it better.

949
00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:19,715
You didn't miss me?
You didn't miss me?

950
00:50:19,717 --> 00:50:21,517
I was in jail last night.
You didn't miss me?

951
00:50:21,519 --> 00:50:23,119
No.

952
00:50:23,121 --> 00:50:27,656
You lying.
Don't fucking lie to me.

953
00:50:27,658 --> 00:50:31,160
You didn't miss me?

954
00:50:31,162 --> 00:50:35,464
Look. I'm sorry. All right?

955
00:50:35,466 --> 00:50:37,566
I saw you sitting there
with that dude. And I flipped.

956
00:50:37,568 --> 00:50:41,070
What are you talking about?

957
00:50:41,072 --> 00:50:43,039
Yo, you...

958
00:50:43,041 --> 00:50:46,409
You could be with anybody in
the world you want to be with.

959
00:50:46,411 --> 00:50:48,677
You're beautiful.
You done travelled the world.

960
00:50:48,679 --> 00:50:53,682
You could have
travelled the world, Lyle.

961
00:50:53,684 --> 00:50:57,653
Hey, I still want to, yo.
I still want to.

962
00:50:57,655 --> 00:51:02,224
Like, but, yo, if you leave,
like how...

963
00:51:03,593 --> 00:51:07,229
You know?

964
00:51:07,231 --> 00:51:11,434
Yo, you just...
You can't, please.

965
00:51:11,436 --> 00:51:16,172
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

966
00:51:19,676 --> 00:51:21,510
I love you.

967
00:51:25,582 --> 00:51:27,183
Please.

968
00:51:35,192 --> 00:51:39,462
(Sighing)

969
00:51:41,264 --> 00:51:43,866
(Horns honking)

970
00:51:51,408 --> 00:51:53,242
Mommy, here!

971
00:51:53,244 --> 00:51:55,244
CHICO:
Nina! Nina!

972
00:51:55,246 --> 00:51:56,812
I'm sorry. I'm in a hurry.

973
00:51:56,814 --> 00:51:59,215
Hey, hey, hey. You don't have to
feel embarrassed.

974
00:51:59,217 --> 00:52:00,416
What are you...
What are you talking about?

975
00:52:00,418 --> 00:52:03,152
There's no reason to be
embarrassed about last night.

976
00:52:03,154 --> 00:52:05,688
I don't know
what you're talking about.

977
00:52:05,690 --> 00:52:08,557
Well, okay, I know.
I know it's none of my business.

978
00:52:08,559 --> 00:52:10,259
But I just wanted to
let you know that

979
00:52:10,261 --> 00:52:13,262
my ex-wife had a drug problem.

980
00:52:13,264 --> 00:52:14,597
What?

981
00:52:14,599 --> 00:52:17,399
So, I understand.

982
00:52:17,401 --> 00:52:20,703
But, okay, all right,
no judgement.

983
00:52:20,705 --> 00:52:22,304
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have said anything.

984
00:52:22,306 --> 00:52:23,806
But, umm,
I just wanted to let you know

985
00:52:23,808 --> 00:52:27,510
that if you needed an ear,
I'm here.

986
00:52:32,849 --> 00:52:35,718
(Door closing)

987
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:38,587
Hey.

988
00:52:38,589 --> 00:52:40,389
What's all this?

989
00:52:40,391 --> 00:52:42,858
I wanted to do
something different.

990
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:45,861
Change can be good, you know?

991
00:52:45,863 --> 00:52:47,463
True.

992
00:52:51,902 --> 00:52:53,235
(Sizzling)

993
00:52:53,237 --> 00:52:55,304
Hey, where's that bag at?

994
00:52:55,306 --> 00:52:57,540
What bag?

995
00:52:57,542 --> 00:53:00,910
Two for Three said he came by
last night, dropped the bag off.

996
00:53:00,912 --> 00:53:03,879
You don't want to eat first?

997
00:53:03,881 --> 00:53:05,481
You know I like
to smoke before I eat.

998
00:53:05,483 --> 00:53:07,483
You can't wait?

999
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:14,523
You all right?

1000
00:53:21,398 --> 00:53:22,932
What if we took a break?

1001
00:53:27,370 --> 00:53:29,572
Is it... Is it Chico?

1002
00:53:29,574 --> 00:53:32,208
What?

1003
00:53:32,210 --> 00:53:33,475
You know I'm-a kill him, right?

1004
00:53:33,477 --> 00:53:35,344
What?

1005
00:53:35,346 --> 00:53:36,779
I'm-a take his head off.

1006
00:53:36,781 --> 00:53:41,717
No, I mean a break from weed.

1007
00:53:41,719 --> 00:53:42,885
(Laughing)

1008
00:53:42,887 --> 00:53:46,222
Oh.

1009
00:53:46,224 --> 00:53:49,725
Wait. You want to
take a break from weed?

1010
00:53:49,727 --> 00:53:54,363
Just for, like, you know, a week
or so, to see how it feels.

1011
00:53:54,365 --> 00:53:58,567
Well, I already know how it
feels. That's why I smoke.

1012
00:54:08,678 --> 00:54:10,279
WOMAN ON TV:
<i>The coconut oil</i>
<i>gives it the richness--</i>

1013
00:54:10,281 --> 00:54:11,513
<i>Utter tragedy.</i>

1014
00:54:11,515 --> 00:54:16,518
Let's make brownies.

1015
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:17,553
That's...

1016
00:54:17,555 --> 00:54:18,554
Come on.

1017
00:54:18,556 --> 00:54:19,588
That's not-- No.

1018
00:54:19,590 --> 00:54:20,823
Come on. It'll be fun.

1019
00:54:20,825 --> 00:54:22,258
I don't even think
you're supposed to

1020
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:24,026
use that kind of bud
to make brownies.

1021
00:54:24,028 --> 00:54:25,561
Yes, yes, yes, you can.
And look.

1022
00:54:25,563 --> 00:54:27,429
Tomorrow, at the planetarium,

1023
00:54:27,431 --> 00:54:28,964
they're having the
Spring Equinox Festival.

1024
00:54:28,966 --> 00:54:31,567
And they'll have
a light show and a DJ.

1025
00:54:31,569 --> 00:54:33,002
We could see different galaxies.

1026
00:54:33,004 --> 00:54:35,604
And it's going to be crazy,
especially if we're tripping.

1027
00:54:35,606 --> 00:54:39,575
I don't know if I wanna
do that...
Please, please, please, please.

1028
00:54:39,577 --> 00:54:41,877
I always wanted to
make brownies. Please.

1029
00:54:41,879 --> 00:54:43,445
All right, all right.

1030
00:54:43,447 --> 00:54:47,483
Cool.

1031
00:54:47,485 --> 00:54:49,852
JACKIE:
Yeah, I know
a fucking hand job spot.

1032
00:54:49,854 --> 00:54:51,720
I want to get, like,
three fucking Asian bitches.

1033
00:54:51,722 --> 00:54:53,889
I don't even give a fuck.
I want mad fucking blow.

1034
00:54:53,891 --> 00:54:56,725
I'll go in a fucking hotel.
I don't give a fuck.

1035
00:54:56,727 --> 00:55:00,696
Yo, dick.
What are you doing tonight?

1036
00:55:00,698 --> 00:55:03,432
Nina made brownies. We gon'
chill, get high and shit.

1037
00:55:03,434 --> 00:55:04,500
What?

1038
00:55:04,502 --> 00:55:06,335
Nina made brownies.

1039
00:55:06,337 --> 00:55:08,003
Nah, bro, fuck that.
We gon' kick--

1040
00:55:08,005 --> 00:55:09,638
Listen. Listen. Listen.
You're coming out tonight.

1041
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:12,374
My boy Al got a vaporizer.

1042
00:55:12,376 --> 00:55:13,676
The fuck is a vaporizer?

1043
00:55:13,678 --> 00:55:16,345
This shit just fucking
turns it into, like, a fume.

1044
00:55:16,347 --> 00:55:19,048
You inhale it through a bag.
Crazy shit.

1045
00:55:19,050 --> 00:55:20,683
Made these brownies, man.

1046
00:55:20,685 --> 00:55:22,418
Nah, yo,
I don't believe this shit.

1047
00:55:22,420 --> 00:55:24,019
You're going to
fucking eat brownies?

1048
00:55:24,021 --> 00:55:27,356
You're not coming out?
I get off probation today.

1049
00:55:27,358 --> 00:55:30,859
Yeah, but I got Nina.

1050
00:55:30,861 --> 00:55:33,729
Yo, this fucking kid's telling
me he's not coming out tonight

1051
00:55:33,731 --> 00:55:36,699
'cause he's fucking making
brownies. What a fucking bitch.

1052
00:55:36,701 --> 00:55:39,401
Who are you, Betty Crocker?
I'm not a fucking bitch.

1053
00:55:39,403 --> 00:55:40,736
I'm no bitch, man.

1054
00:55:40,738 --> 00:55:42,671
You're not no bitch.
All right, so you're coming out?

1055
00:55:42,673 --> 00:55:44,506
No. I got plans.

1056
00:55:44,508 --> 00:55:45,874
I thought you said
you weren't a bitch.

1057
00:55:45,876 --> 00:55:46,975
I'm not a bitch, dog.

1058
00:55:46,977 --> 00:55:51,513
So, you're coming out?

1059
00:55:51,515 --> 00:55:53,816
I'm not no bitch.

1060
00:55:53,818 --> 00:55:55,517
All right, cool,
so you're coming out.

1061
00:55:55,519 --> 00:55:57,753
I don't know, bro. This guy's on
some real fucking bitch shit.

1062
00:55:57,755 --> 00:55:59,888
Yeah, still working here.

1063
00:55:59,890 --> 00:56:02,391
Hey, guys, can you chill out?

1064
00:56:02,393 --> 00:56:05,494
How 'bout you shut up?

1065
00:56:05,496 --> 00:56:08,530
I have to... Hang on a sec.

1066
00:56:08,532 --> 00:56:09,698
I'm telling on all of you guys.
I'm telling your teacher.

1067
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:10,699
You're going to be
in so much trouble.

1068
00:56:10,701 --> 00:56:11,700
I can't wait.

1069
00:56:11,702 --> 00:56:12,701
Screw you.

1070
00:56:12,703 --> 00:56:15,070
Yeah, I got to
work late tonight.

1071
00:56:15,072 --> 00:56:17,973
Can't we just, like,
move it to 7:00?

1072
00:56:17,975 --> 00:56:19,842
Yeah. Did you want to
get dinner?

1073
00:56:19,844 --> 00:56:22,745
(Knocking)

1074
00:56:22,747 --> 00:56:24,813
All right, cool. I'll look into
what's around there.

1075
00:56:24,815 --> 00:56:29,818
You dicks! Ah! That hurt!

1076
00:56:29,820 --> 00:56:31,687
No fucking way.

1077
00:56:31,689 --> 00:56:32,955
Whoa!

1078
00:56:32,957 --> 00:56:34,823
I want those.

1079
00:56:34,825 --> 00:56:36,458
Are they strong?

1080
00:56:36,460 --> 00:56:38,894
It's my first time.
So, I don't know.

1081
00:56:38,896 --> 00:56:40,562
The weed didn't
really fricassee.

1082
00:56:40,564 --> 00:56:43,399
But if you take two,
I'm sure you'll trip.

1083
00:56:43,401 --> 00:56:45,801
Ah!

1084
00:56:45,803 --> 00:56:47,436
Nina!

1085
00:56:47,438 --> 00:56:48,504
Spit it out! Spit it out!

1086
00:56:48,506 --> 00:56:50,939
Spit it out!

1087
00:56:50,941 --> 00:56:53,842
Ah! Ah!

1088
00:56:53,844 --> 00:56:56,712
Okay, well...

1089
00:56:56,714 --> 00:56:59,681
WOMAN:
Jimmy, boys,
what's going on over here?

1090
00:56:59,683 --> 00:57:00,682
Nina--

1091
00:57:00,684 --> 00:57:02,985
Jimmy took the brownies
from that bag.

1092
00:57:02,987 --> 00:57:04,153
I am so sorry, Miss Nina.

1093
00:57:04,155 --> 00:57:06,088
Shame on you, boys.

1094
00:57:06,090 --> 00:57:09,792
Yeah, it is. We saw you with it.
You guys are in trouble.

1095
00:57:09,794 --> 00:57:11,894
Apologize.
It's not my bag.

1096
00:57:11,896 --> 00:57:13,095
Get up. Get up.

1097
00:57:13,097 --> 00:57:14,530
It's not my bag.

1098
00:57:14,532 --> 00:57:17,032
No, you don't have to--
Good brownies!

1099
00:57:17,034 --> 00:57:18,133
Get inside.

1100
00:57:18,135 --> 00:57:20,068
I am so--
It's not mine.

1101
00:57:20,070 --> 00:57:22,104
They do this all the time.
I'm really sorry.

1102
00:57:22,106 --> 00:57:24,506
If there's one thing, one piece
of advice I can give you,

1103
00:57:24,508 --> 00:57:27,009
it's "Don't have kids."
I'm kidding.

1104
00:57:27,011 --> 00:57:28,944
I'm sort of...
I'm kind of kidding.

1105
00:57:28,946 --> 00:57:32,881
I'm sorry. I really am.

They have homes.

1141
00:59:37,741 --> 00:59:38,740
Get back to the group.

1142
00:59:38,742 --> 00:59:40,175

Yo, take his shoes.

I'll put 'em on
the telephone wire.

Yo, we should
put it in the oven.

Yo, you need to go to boot camp.

1170

1415
01:19:24,227 --> 01:19:25,226
Then why are you
knocking on my door?

1416
01:19:25,228 --> 01:19:27,027
I love you, young brother.

1417
01:19:27,029 --> 01:19:29,263
But you got to use
a little common sense.

1418
01:19:29,265 --> 01:19:31,065
I just want to talk to Nina.

1419
01:19:31,067 --> 01:19:33,400
You can't talk to her, okay?

1420
01:19:33,402 --> 01:19:35,236
You cannot talk to her.

1421
01:19:35,238 --> 01:19:38,105
So, just accept that
as a way of life.

1422
01:19:38,107 --> 01:19:39,807
And get on with your life.

1423
