1
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,466
Fuck!

2
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:27,833
- Fuck!
- White.

3
00:00:27,866 --> 00:00:29,200
Are you fucking
kidding me?

4
00:00:30,433 --> 00:00:31,800
No.

5
00:00:31,833 --> 00:00:33,800
- How far out was it?
- It was long.

6
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:36,933
Fuckin' will!

7
00:00:38,433 --> 00:00:39,866
Line.

8
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:40,900
All right.

9
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,000
Love - 30.

10
00:00:52,033 --> 00:00:54,000
Come on.
Come on!

11
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:02,700
- What's the score?
- My 40.

12
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,533
Match point.

13
00:01:05,566 --> 00:01:06,566
Thanks.

14
00:01:33,066 --> 00:01:36,033
I'm sorry, man.
Tough game.

15
00:03:04,866 --> 00:03:08,100
Fuck!
Are you serious right now?

16
00:03:08,133 --> 00:03:09,766
Fuckin' asshole.

17
00:03:21,866 --> 00:03:24,700
One, two...

18
00:03:24,733 --> 00:03:26,700
Three...

19
00:03:26,733 --> 00:03:28,533
Four...

20
00:03:28,566 --> 00:03:30,200
Hey, baby.

21
00:03:30,233 --> 00:03:34,000
Hey, chewbacca.

22
00:03:34,033 --> 00:03:35,166
Hey.

23
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,733
- Did you walk chewy today?
- Yeah.

24
00:03:37,766 --> 00:03:40,100
- I see he left us a present.
- What the fuck, dude?

25
00:03:40,133 --> 00:03:41,766
I just walked you.

26
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,933
How far
did you walk him?

27
00:03:43,966 --> 00:03:45,166
I walked him
around the block.

28
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,933
The same way
i always do.

29
00:03:46,966 --> 00:03:49,100
Did you take him
to the grassy part

30
00:03:49,133 --> 00:03:50,842
- Across the street?
- I took him the same way

31
00:03:50,866 --> 00:03:54,033
- I always walk him.
- Okay, just...

32
00:03:54,066 --> 00:03:56,166
Saying that's where
he usually poops for me.

33
00:03:58,033 --> 00:04:00,733
- Babe?
- What?

34
00:04:00,766 --> 00:04:04,100
- I missed you.
- I missed you, too, baby.

35
00:04:04,133 --> 00:04:06,233
- Did you win?
- Tsk. Of course.

36
00:04:06,266 --> 00:04:07,666
Nice.

37
00:04:09,733 --> 00:04:11,566
- Oh, gross.
- What? Come here.

38
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,500
- Oh, no.
- Come on.

39
00:04:13,533 --> 00:04:16,233
You go take a shower.
I have a chapter left
in my book.

40
00:04:16,266 --> 00:04:18,600
Then we can
go get tacos.

41
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:20,933
Oh, remember,
i'm going to danny's

42
00:04:20,966 --> 00:04:22,533
For the men's
city match tonight.

43
00:04:22,566 --> 00:04:23,633
So...

44
00:04:25,566 --> 00:04:27,566
- What?
- -You've been home five minutes,

45
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,733
- And you're already leaving.
- Dude, come with us.

46
00:04:29,766 --> 00:04:31,633
And watch soccer?

47
00:04:31,666 --> 00:04:34,133
I can narrate it for you.

48
00:04:34,166 --> 00:04:37,566
Do you... do you see
what you're doing, though?

49
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,809
There will be
other girls there.

50
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:40,700
Yeah. What other girls?

51
00:04:40,733 --> 00:04:42,966
Danny's girlfriend
will probably be there.

52
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,566
- That chick?
- What the fuck
is your problem?

53
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,642
You know, they're probably
already getting shitfaced.

54
00:04:48,666 --> 00:04:53,100
So, you should head off now
before they start without you.

55
00:04:53,133 --> 00:04:55,500
Good times.

56
00:04:55,533 --> 00:04:56,809
You know,
you should really listen

57
00:04:56,833 --> 00:04:57,800
To yourself right now.

58
00:04:57,833 --> 00:04:59,100
Yeah, well, you know,

59
00:04:59,133 --> 00:05:00,800
You should do the dishes
like you promised

60
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:02,242
Instead of getting
lit up and watching

61
00:05:02,266 --> 00:05:03,933
Boring-Ass soccer.

62
00:05:03,966 --> 00:05:05,900
I'm gonna do the dishes
when i get home.

63
00:05:05,933 --> 00:05:08,933
Right, at 2:00 a.M.
That's gonna happen.

64
00:05:51,666 --> 00:05:53,533
I'm leaving now,
okay, baby?

65
00:05:58,666 --> 00:05:59,666
I love you.

66
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:11,166
I'll bring you a cupcake
from the cupcake atm.

67
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:14,000
I know how much you love
automated desserts.

68
00:06:16,866 --> 00:06:18,666
It better be chocolate.

69
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:24,366
You...

70
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,733
You promise it won't be
a late night?

71
00:06:26,766 --> 00:06:28,266
I'll be home by 11:30.

72
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:30,833
Okay? Promise.

73
00:06:30,866 --> 00:06:32,333
I promise.

74
00:06:32,366 --> 00:06:35,100
Stop.

75
00:06:35,133 --> 00:06:36,366
You...

76
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,033
You go get out of here.

77
00:06:38,066 --> 00:06:39,066
You don't wanna miss

78
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:42,033
Your stupid soccer game,
asshole.

79
00:06:42,066 --> 00:06:44,000
- Love you.
- I love you, too.

80
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,066
Whatever was left
of your physical self...

81
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:09,733
Give me that spot.
Where's my spot?

82
00:07:09,766 --> 00:07:13,066
But anyways, you know,
i would like to live...

83
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:16,100
Fuckin' finally.

84
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:24,866
Maybe it's
a form of immortality
for the human race.

85
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:27,233
Maybe this is what
will allow your race

86
00:07:27,266 --> 00:07:28,800
To survive indefinitely
as a species

87
00:07:28,833 --> 00:07:30,866
And only necessary,
i totally accept that.

88
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:33,633
But for me, personally...

89
00:07:47,966 --> 00:07:51,966
Super mario
futbol's balotelli no?

90
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
- No. He shoulda passed that
to silva, dude.
- Hey!

91
00:07:55,033 --> 00:07:57,433
- Silva was wide open.
- Bolatelli all day.

92
00:07:57,466 --> 00:07:59,333
- You like that mohawk kid?
- Ballate.

93
00:07:59,366 --> 00:08:02,700
I heard his balls
have that mohawk. No?

94
00:08:02,733 --> 00:08:04,733
The doers
a born finisher.

95
00:08:04,766 --> 00:08:06,100
- Like me.
- He could.

96
00:08:06,133 --> 00:08:07,833
According to erin
you're a quick finisher.

97
00:08:07,866 --> 00:08:10,700
Well, i score a lot of goals.

98
00:08:10,733 --> 00:08:12,133
So...

99
00:08:12,166 --> 00:08:14,033
Hey, mario,
can i trim your balls

100
00:08:14,066 --> 00:08:18,800
To match your mohawk
that's on your head?

101
00:08:18,833 --> 00:08:20,466
- Is that erin?
- Uh...

102
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,733
- Why didn't she come?
- You know, it's your mom,

103
00:08:22,766 --> 00:08:24,800
And she came last night
all over me.

104
00:08:26,933 --> 00:08:29,066
That was fucked up.

105
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:30,333
You want some cheetos?

106
00:08:30,366 --> 00:08:33,300
- Absolutely not.
- Here, buddy.

107
00:08:33,333 --> 00:08:36,766
- Three to two as they...
- There he goes.

108
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,766
There he...

109
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,433
- Get off me!
- Oh, yeah!

110
00:08:47,466 --> 00:08:49,300
What did i tell you?
What did i tell you?

111
00:08:49,333 --> 00:08:51,233
I'm on fuckin' fire.
Balotelli.

112
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:54,242
At least he scored.
The guy's a douche.

113
00:08:54,266 --> 00:08:56,066
At least he scored.

114
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,000
Yes!

115
00:08:58,033 --> 00:09:00,000
Hey, brand,
how's it going?

116
00:09:00,033 --> 00:09:03,466
Well, i've been better,
obviously, but we're managing.

117
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:06,133
- How 'bout you?
- I'm good.

118
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:08,333
Hangin' in there.
I mean...

119
00:09:08,366 --> 00:09:11,533
So, did you get
my letter?

120
00:09:11,566 --> 00:09:15,000
Letter?
No, i didn't get any letter.

121
00:09:15,033 --> 00:09:16,366
All right, well,
when you get it,

122
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:19,133
Can you sign that stuff
and send it back to me?

123
00:09:19,166 --> 00:09:21,200
Last thing i need
is us to chase you down over

124
00:09:21,233 --> 00:09:23,333
A few signatures, okay?

125
00:09:23,366 --> 00:09:24,966
Yeah, okay.

126
00:09:26,266 --> 00:09:28,066
Okay. Good.

127
00:09:29,533 --> 00:09:33,533
So, did everything
go smoothly wednesday?

128
00:09:33,566 --> 00:09:36,033
Smoothly?

129
00:09:36,066 --> 00:09:39,300
Yeah, that is one way
you could put it.

130
00:09:39,333 --> 00:09:40,533
By the way,
are you planning on

131
00:09:40,566 --> 00:09:42,466
Even telling erin?

132
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:45,200
One second.

133
00:09:45,233 --> 00:09:47,100
I should probably
get back.

134
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,433
Right, yeah,
no worries.

135
00:09:51,466 --> 00:09:53,100
Talk to you soon, will.

136
00:09:53,133 --> 00:09:54,466
Okay, yeah, definitely.

137
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,933
Take care, bud.

138
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:01,166
Am i wrong?

139
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,409
Am i wrong?
- Throw the fuckin'...

140
00:10:02,433 --> 00:10:03,833
Are you telling me
you would take

141
00:10:03,866 --> 00:10:05,366
Shredder over krang,
he is a brain.

142
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,433
Krang is the worst bad guy
of all time.

143
00:10:07,466 --> 00:10:10,000
He... he looks like
a nut sack.

144
00:10:10,033 --> 00:10:11,866
What the fuck
did you just say?

145
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:14,166
Krang was the best
fuckin' bad guy ever.

146
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:18,566
Krang always ended
every sentence with a burp.

147
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,209
- The shit was awesome.
- Dude, all i know

148
00:10:20,233 --> 00:10:21,600
Is that when he a brain...

149
00:10:21,633 --> 00:10:22,600
- Fuck!
- Good shot.

150
00:10:22,633 --> 00:10:24,133
When he was a brain,

151
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:26,400
Inside the box, whatever...
cool, i get it,

152
00:10:26,433 --> 00:10:28,366
But when he started
to appear in...

153
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,500
He was unstoppable.
Is that what you're saying?

154
00:10:30,533 --> 00:10:32,533
The lower navel area
of a big muscular man,

155
00:10:32,566 --> 00:10:34,200
I wasn't cool with it.

156
00:10:34,233 --> 00:10:36,633
Who is texting krang now?

157
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:39,000
Dude, get off
the fucking phone.

158
00:10:39,033 --> 00:10:40,266
Seriously.

159
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:41,600
A fuckin'
olympic gold medalist

160
00:10:41,633 --> 00:10:43,600
At fuckin'
thumb blasting over there.

161
00:10:43,633 --> 00:10:44,966
Let's wrap it up,
for real.

162
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,466
We're going to the bar.

163
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,966
We're gonna walk to fatty's,
grab a road beer

164
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,566
'Cause you can't stay here,
for real.

165
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,433
- All right, guys.
- Done. You ready?

166
00:10:52,466 --> 00:10:54,400
- My rodeo ends here.
- What?

167
00:10:54,433 --> 00:10:55,933
I got to get home
to the lady.

168
00:10:55,966 --> 00:10:58,266
Seriously, bro?
Fuck!

169
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:00,133
You are pussy whipped
like a motherfucker.

170
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:01,933
I know.
It's sad.

171
00:11:01,966 --> 00:11:04,300
It's like you mom's
always horny and lonely...

172
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:06,166
Dude, come on,
i'm serious.

173
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:09,000
- Back me up, for real.
- Yeah, it's sad...

174
00:11:09,033 --> 00:11:10,376
- But it's true.
- It's fuckin' true.

175
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,900
Yeah.

176
00:11:11,933 --> 00:11:14,000
She's got you, bro.
She's got you.

177
00:11:14,033 --> 00:11:15,542
- Are you done?
- She's got you on the chain.

178
00:11:15,566 --> 00:11:17,966
One drink.

179
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,442
-One drink. I'm buying.
I'm buying.
-It'll take us five minutes.

180
00:11:20,466 --> 00:11:21,633
We'll walk down there,

181
00:11:21,666 --> 00:11:22,966
We'll be there
in five minutes.

182
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,166
Done. One drink.
Maybe two.

183
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,266
One drink.

184
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:39,366
Oh, chewbacca.

185
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:42,100
Miss my boy?

186
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,466
Hey, babe?

187
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:55,000
You awake?

188
00:12:00,466 --> 00:12:01,933
Yeah.

189
00:13:58,833 --> 00:14:01,700
What the fuck?
You're jerking off?

190
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:07,400
Yeah.

191
00:14:09,133 --> 00:14:10,633
Give me
my fucking laptop.

192
00:14:10,666 --> 00:14:12,300
Sorry.
It's just...

193
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:13,766
Hey.

194
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,476
I don't know what to do...
you want me to do.

195
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,366
You locked the door.

196
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,466
Okay.

197
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:31,533
I'm done.

198
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,500
I can't do this anymore.

199
00:14:38,866 --> 00:14:41,333
I waited for you
for three hours.

200
00:14:44,233 --> 00:14:46,533
You don't give a shit
about me or my feelings

201
00:14:46,566 --> 00:14:49,666
- Or my time.
- That's...

202
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:51,600
That's really not true.

203
00:14:51,633 --> 00:14:55,200
- And the door was...
- Look.

204
00:14:55,233 --> 00:14:57,100
You can stay
on the couch tonight but...

205
00:14:58,933 --> 00:15:00,733
Tomorrow morning
i want you to leave.

206
00:15:05,233 --> 00:15:07,166
Come here, chewy.

207
00:16:54,466 --> 00:16:56,600
- Daniel-Son.
- Will, what up, man?

208
00:16:56,633 --> 00:16:58,266
Hey, man,
good times last night.

209
00:16:58,300 --> 00:16:59,466
So, listen.

210
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:02,666
I need to ask
the biggest favor

211
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:04,000
This world
has ever known.

212
00:17:04,033 --> 00:17:05,633
How many times
we got to go through this?

213
00:17:05,666 --> 00:17:07,000
I'm not gonna suck
your dick.

214
00:17:07,033 --> 00:17:08,633
Fuck you, man.

215
00:17:08,666 --> 00:17:10,333
But, serious,
i need you to suck my dick.

216
00:17:10,366 --> 00:17:12,000
No, uh...

217
00:17:12,033 --> 00:17:14,700
I need a place to crash
for a couple nights.

218
00:17:14,733 --> 00:17:16,333
And we both know
how well

219
00:17:16,366 --> 00:17:17,666
Me and your couch
get along.

220
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:20,733
So, do you feel like
hooking that up or?

221
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,866
- You there?
- Yeah, um,

222
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:27,900
Actually, man,
laura's actually,

223
00:17:27,933 --> 00:17:31,533
She's moving in tomorrow.

224
00:17:31,566 --> 00:17:34,000
We're, like,
gonna be living together now.

225
00:17:35,566 --> 00:17:39,033
Oh, well, shit, man.
Congratulations.

226
00:17:39,066 --> 00:17:41,333
Thanks, man.
I mean, we're psyched.

227
00:17:41,366 --> 00:17:44,366
So, doesn't... doesn't
your brother live around here?

228
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,900
Like, l.A.
Or somewhere near l.A.?

229
00:17:46,933 --> 00:17:48,400
Yeah, no, no, no.

230
00:17:48,433 --> 00:17:51,833
I am actually
gonna call him now.

231
00:17:51,866 --> 00:17:53,966
All right, well,
sorry again, dude,

232
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,633
But good luck
with all that.

233
00:17:56,666 --> 00:17:58,733
Thanks.
Yeah, it's no problem.

234
00:17:58,766 --> 00:18:00,066
I'll talk to you later,
dude.

235
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:01,600
Take it easy, man.

236
00:18:03,133 --> 00:18:04,466
Fuck.

237
00:18:07,633 --> 00:18:08,833
What, uh,

238
00:18:08,866 --> 00:18:10,766
What would be
the going rate

239
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,533
For a place like that?

240
00:18:12,566 --> 00:18:14,366
Well, you know,
it depends.

241
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,900
It sounds like the structure
is probably pretty old

242
00:18:16,933 --> 00:18:18,766
But i... i would think
you'd get somewhere

243
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,600
In the $250,000 range.

244
00:18:20,633 --> 00:18:22,066
I mean,
if you could modernize

245
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:24,800
- The plumbing and wiring.
- You mean thousands?

246
00:18:24,833 --> 00:18:26,800
Excuse me?

247
00:18:26,833 --> 00:18:28,666
$250,000?

248
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:29,900
Yes.

249
00:18:31,633 --> 00:18:33,766
But i'll take a look
at the photos

250
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,800
When you send them,
and we'll go from there.

251
00:18:35,833 --> 00:18:37,466
- Okay.
- So, do you...

252
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,700
Do you plan on preparing
the property yourself?

253
00:18:39,733 --> 00:18:41,409
Or are you going to have
an outside company

254
00:18:41,433 --> 00:18:42,733
Do that for you?

255
00:18:42,766 --> 00:18:44,800
- I've got some phone numbers.
- Nope.

256
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:47,500
I am gonna prep it
myself, i think.

257
00:18:47,533 --> 00:18:49,100
Okay.

258
00:18:49,133 --> 00:18:53,766
But what would i do...

259
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:56,766
What would you do
to prep that sort of thing

260
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:59,633
That's out in the middle
of nowhere like that?

261
00:20:15,233 --> 00:20:19,633
Fucking bill baxter,
you dumbass.

262
00:21:37,566 --> 00:21:39,166
No.

263
00:22:25,233 --> 00:22:27,966
Whoa, almost.

264
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,333
Come on out, guy.

265
00:22:30,366 --> 00:22:32,100
Yes!

266
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:42,900
Fuck.

267
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,300
Mm.

268
00:24:00,433 --> 00:24:03,233
Now what do we have here?

269
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,733
You sly bastard.

270
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:55,633
I seriously had no idea.

271
00:26:55,666 --> 00:26:58,966
You are amazing.

272
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,366
It's too bad
that brendan and sarah

273
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,600
Couldn't come though.

274
00:27:02,633 --> 00:27:04,600
You invited them,
right?

275
00:27:04,633 --> 00:27:06,633
He's probably
on a business trip.

276
00:27:06,666 --> 00:27:09,533
- You didn't?
- Hey, where'd you put
the twisty ties?

277
00:27:09,566 --> 00:27:11,266
Babe, you still
have to invite them though.

278
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:13,033
- They're family.
- You put them here.

279
00:27:13,066 --> 00:27:15,066
- So you must've moved 'em.
- I mean, come on.

280
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:18,000
You don't have to take out
the stuff with your dad
out on brendan.

281
00:27:51,033 --> 00:27:53,533
Are you ready
for your present?

282
00:27:53,566 --> 00:27:55,000
Oh, my god.

283
00:28:10,433 --> 00:28:12,566
Can i ask you something?

284
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:13,733
- Hmm?
- But,

285
00:28:13,766 --> 00:28:16,066
You have to promise
not to get mad.

286
00:28:20,433 --> 00:28:23,100
Pinky promise.

287
00:28:23,133 --> 00:28:27,200
So, if...

288
00:28:27,233 --> 00:28:29,500
And when we get married

289
00:28:31,366 --> 00:28:33,600
Will i get to meet
your dad?

290
00:28:33,633 --> 00:28:36,566
Are you gonna even like,
invite him to the wedding?

291
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,266
Will?

292
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,433
Come on.

293
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,300
You never talk about him.

294
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:55,066
You can't just cut
your dad out.

295
00:28:59,466 --> 00:29:01,066
Talk to me.

296
00:29:04,266 --> 00:29:06,533
No secrets, right?

297
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:13,500
Did i ever tell you
about the time when i was six

298
00:29:13,533 --> 00:29:14,676
And i went
to the grocery store

299
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:17,333
With my dad

300
00:29:17,366 --> 00:29:21,100
And he hid a case of beer
below the carts

301
00:29:21,133 --> 00:29:24,266
So the cashier
couldn't see it?

302
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:26,433
And six year old me
was like, "hey, dad.

303
00:29:26,466 --> 00:29:30,266
Don't forget
about this beer down here."

304
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:31,600
And he's like,
"oh, yeah.

305
00:29:31,633 --> 00:29:34,100
How could i have
forgotten about the beer?"

306
00:29:36,133 --> 00:29:38,700
And we went out into
the parking lot...

307
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:43,566
- He takes off his belt...
- Okay, you don't...

308
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:47,466
No, no, no.
It's a good story.

309
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:50,166
He takes off his belt,

310
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:53,466
And he lays the fuck
into me.

311
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:56,133
He tells me to shut
my fuckin' mouth next time.

312
00:29:59,233 --> 00:30:01,033
I was six years old.

313
00:30:03,333 --> 00:30:05,266
Yeah, he wasn't mad.

314
00:30:15,366 --> 00:30:16,600
Happy birthday.

315
00:30:37,566 --> 00:30:39,066
Hello?

316
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:46,166
Hello?

317
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,233
One second.

318
00:31:00,766 --> 00:31:03,500
- Hello.
- Hey there, son.

319
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:07,733
- Hey.
- Brendan, right?

320
00:31:07,766 --> 00:31:09,333
I'm will.

321
00:31:09,366 --> 00:31:10,733
Brendan's
my younger brother,

322
00:31:10,766 --> 00:31:12,533
- Actually.
- Bill, jr.

323
00:31:12,566 --> 00:31:15,900
Well, i hardly
recognized you, son.

324
00:31:15,933 --> 00:31:18,466
Well,
i... i'm roger miller.

325
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:20,466
You know,
from the miller cabin?

326
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:22,166
You mind if we step in
for a second?

327
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,600
There's something
i need to ask you about.

328
00:31:24,633 --> 00:31:27,466
Oh. No, come on in.

329
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:28,833
Come on, otis.

330
00:31:31,433 --> 00:31:33,500
So, at the height
of the chemo,

331
00:31:33,533 --> 00:31:37,366
I just started
looking after otis here

332
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:40,900
Not figuring
what would happen

333
00:31:40,933 --> 00:31:42,566
When, um...

334
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,800
Anyway,
we've grown to love him,

335
00:31:44,833 --> 00:31:46,933
But something like that,
i figured,

336
00:31:46,966 --> 00:31:48,700
Would be
pretty important to you.

337
00:31:50,433 --> 00:31:53,233
- Yeah...
- I brought his bowls

338
00:31:53,266 --> 00:31:57,433
And what was left
of the dry food.

339
00:31:57,466 --> 00:32:01,266
And, well,
his doggie hiking boots.

340
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:02,933
Just let him out
once in a while

341
00:32:02,966 --> 00:32:05,633
And take him
on a hike or two.

342
00:32:05,666 --> 00:32:07,366
Too old to be much
of a nuisance.

343
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,600
Aren't you, otis?
Yeah.

344
00:32:09,633 --> 00:32:10,866
Wow, thanks, roger.

345
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:12,500
That's... that's
really nice,

346
00:32:12,533 --> 00:32:14,600
But i'm leaving
in a few days.

347
00:32:14,633 --> 00:32:16,300
- So...
- Oh, that's no problem.

348
00:32:16,333 --> 00:32:18,433
He's used to traveling
around with us a lot.

349
00:32:18,466 --> 00:32:22,266
I mean, we're in the rv
six months out of the year.

350
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:23,933
Did your dad ever tell you

351
00:32:23,966 --> 00:32:27,566
About that trip he took
to yosemite with us?

352
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:30,633
- No, he didn't.
- Oh, that was a trip, boy.

353
00:32:30,666 --> 00:32:32,600
That was a trip.

354
00:32:32,633 --> 00:32:36,500
Three-Handed pinochle
till all hours of the night.

355
00:32:36,533 --> 00:32:38,700
Well, we were cutting up
something fierce.

356
00:32:38,733 --> 00:32:41,966
That was fun.

357
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,533
Oh, would you
look at that?

358
00:32:45,566 --> 00:32:46,900
Have you ever been
on that hike

359
00:32:46,933 --> 00:32:47,966
Up to the cinder cone

360
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,800
- Up there?
- No.

361
00:32:49,833 --> 00:32:51,366
Believe me,
it's worth the trek.

362
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,766
I promise that.

363
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,500
Well, i should be
gettin' goin'.

364
00:32:55,533 --> 00:32:58,966
The wife's breakfast
is probably already cold.

365
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,833
- Don't be a stranger.
- Uh...

366
00:33:00,866 --> 00:33:03,866
Anything we can do for you,
you just give us a holler.

367
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:05,333
- Okay, i mean that.
- Roger?

368
00:33:05,366 --> 00:33:07,566
Hmm? What's that?

369
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,933
Where does otis sleep?

370
00:33:13,966 --> 00:33:17,800
Oh, he'll probably
just curl up with you, i bet.

371
00:33:17,833 --> 00:33:19,433
Anyway,
don't be a stranger.

372
00:33:19,466 --> 00:33:21,266
- It's okay.
- Okay. We'll see you, billy.

373
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:23,233
Okay.

374
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:33,733
Okay. Okay.

375
00:33:33,766 --> 00:33:35,633
Oh, yeah, huh?

376
00:33:35,666 --> 00:33:38,466
Oh. Your breath
smells like ass, otis.

377
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:39,900
You know that?

378
00:33:39,933 --> 00:33:41,366
You know that?

379
00:34:15,666 --> 00:34:18,766
Whoo!

380
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,366
Oh! Oh!

381
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,400
Oh, my god.
It's cold!

382
00:34:22,433 --> 00:34:25,066
Otis! Whoo!

383
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:26,566
Get in here,
you big galoot!

384
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:29,400
It's only 30 degrees.

385
00:34:29,433 --> 00:34:31,333
It feels great
in here, buddy.

386
00:34:31,366 --> 00:34:32,533
Whoo!

387
00:34:45,833 --> 00:34:47,566
One for me.

388
00:34:49,833 --> 00:34:51,000
One for you.

389
00:34:53,833 --> 00:34:55,576
Come on, buddy,
you got to eat the carrot part

390
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:57,800
Not just
the peanut butter.

391
00:34:57,833 --> 00:34:59,533
Come on,
you little fatty boombah.

392
00:34:59,566 --> 00:35:02,033
I'll show you
how it's done.

393
00:35:02,066 --> 00:35:03,933
Now, see?

394
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:08,466
What?

395
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:10,400
It's okay
to double-Dip, otis.

396
00:35:10,433 --> 00:35:12,733
I think
we're technically brothers.

397
00:35:14,866 --> 00:35:16,600
Come on.

398
00:35:38,033 --> 00:35:41,600
Cinder cone.

399
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,733
What should i do about this
cinder cone, otis?

400
00:36:03,733 --> 00:36:05,100
So, we are here.

401
00:36:11,066 --> 00:36:12,933
How far can you hike, huh?

402
00:36:14,866 --> 00:36:17,833
I bet you can hike
like a motherfucker.

403
00:36:46,966 --> 00:36:49,133
I'll take you.

404
00:36:49,166 --> 00:36:52,466
Tsk. Oh, yes.

405
00:36:57,066 --> 00:36:58,766
Sizzlin'.

406
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:16,933
Come on, otis.

407
00:37:16,966 --> 00:37:18,200
Let's go.

408
00:37:45,633 --> 00:37:47,800
Otis.

409
00:37:47,833 --> 00:37:49,000
Otis.

410
00:38:00,933 --> 00:38:03,133
Otis.

411
00:38:03,166 --> 00:38:08,133
Otis. Otis.

412
00:38:08,166 --> 00:38:11,966
That's a good boy.

413
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,033
You got it all?
Let's go.

414
00:38:15,066 --> 00:38:17,266
Let's go.
I'm sure there'll be fire.

415
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,033
All right, buddy.
Trust me.

416
00:39:29,066 --> 00:39:30,376
It's for your own good.
All right?

417
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:31,900
You're gonna be good.

418
00:39:31,933 --> 00:39:34,066
So just hang tight.

419
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:38,100
I will be back
in an hour,

420
00:39:38,133 --> 00:39:39,433
Hour-And-A-Half tops.

421
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:47,933
It's all right, bud.

422
00:39:47,966 --> 00:39:50,033
You're good.
I promise.

423
00:39:50,066 --> 00:39:52,233
It's okay.

424
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:58,866
Dude, it's cool.

425
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:30,000
Hey, it's me.

426
00:42:30,033 --> 00:42:32,533
Where the fuck
are you, will?

427
00:42:32,566 --> 00:42:34,566
Look, i know you're doing me
the silent treatment

428
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:36,266
Or whatever
the fuck this is but it...

429
00:42:38,933 --> 00:42:40,266
Will, hey, it's brendan.

430
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:41,566
I've got your paperwork.

431
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:43,466
So, thanks for getting me
that so quickly.

432
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:45,433
I, um...

433
00:42:45,466 --> 00:42:47,633
Listen.
Just give me a call some time.

434
00:42:47,666 --> 00:42:49,033
Okay?

435
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:50,533
I don't know.

436
00:42:50,566 --> 00:42:53,100
Sarah and i just felt like
we should all sit down

437
00:42:53,133 --> 00:42:54,466
Face-To-Face
or something and...

438
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:57,600
Hi, mr. Baxter.

439
00:42:57,633 --> 00:43:00,133
This is liz mccafferty
calling from mccloskey realty.

440
00:43:00,166 --> 00:43:02,066
We spoke about a week ago

441
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:04,466
About that property that you
had recently inherited

442
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:08,200
And i haven't received
that email from you yet.

443
00:43:08,233 --> 00:43:10,066
But i also wanted
to give you a call

444
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:13,033
Because we actually have
two clients interested

445
00:43:13,066 --> 00:43:14,433
In viewing your property.

446
00:43:14,466 --> 00:43:16,866
So, get me those pictures
as fast as you can

447
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:19,400
And hopefully
i will talk to you soon.

448
00:43:19,433 --> 00:43:21,433
All right, hon?
Thanks so much, william.

449
00:43:21,466 --> 00:43:22,666
Bye.

450
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,100
Otis?

451
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:25,700
What the fuck?

452
00:44:25,733 --> 00:44:27,500
Otis?

453
00:44:27,533 --> 00:44:28,966
Otis.

454
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:32,466
Oh, fuck!

455
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:34,400
Fuck!

456
00:44:34,433 --> 00:44:37,566
Fuck! Otis!

457
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:40,133
Otis! Otis!

458
00:44:40,166 --> 00:44:41,700
Fuck!

459
00:44:41,733 --> 00:44:44,333
Otis!

460
00:44:44,366 --> 00:44:46,566
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

461
00:44:47,666 --> 00:44:49,266
Otis!

462
00:44:50,533 --> 00:44:52,000
Otis!

463
00:45:16,266 --> 00:45:17,533
Come on,
let's go to bed.

464
00:45:17,566 --> 00:45:19,733
I'm a fucking idiot.

465
00:45:19,766 --> 00:45:21,766
You are a fucking idiot.

466
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:24,266
But, you know, i'm kind of
exhausted right now,

467
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:26,566
So, let's talk
about that later.

468
00:45:28,833 --> 00:45:30,800
Do you know
if they towed my car?

469
00:45:30,833 --> 00:45:32,666
Or did they just
leave it there?

470
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:34,533
We'll call later.
Come on, let's go to bed.

471
00:45:34,566 --> 00:45:37,400
I don't want to go to bed
like this.

472
00:45:37,433 --> 00:45:39,666
Will you please
just stay up and talk with me?

473
00:45:54,633 --> 00:45:56,633
You had it coming,
but i love you.

474
00:46:06,366 --> 00:46:07,600
I love you.

475
00:46:10,366 --> 00:46:13,300
And i'll be better.

476
00:46:30,333 --> 00:46:31,466
Otis?

477
00:46:33,866 --> 00:46:35,133
Otis!

478
00:46:40,866 --> 00:46:42,200
Otis.

479
00:46:56,866 --> 00:46:58,666
Fuck!

480
00:46:58,700 --> 00:47:02,633
Stupid son of a bitch

481
00:47:02,666 --> 00:47:04,200
Otis!

482
00:47:06,133 --> 00:47:07,533
Otis!

483
00:47:08,766 --> 00:47:10,200
Fuck!

484
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:19,133
One, two...

485
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:25,200
God damn it.

486
00:47:25,233 --> 00:47:26,566
God damn it, otis,

487
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:28,200
You couldn't have
fucking stayed still

488
00:47:28,233 --> 00:47:30,733
For one fucking hour.

489
00:47:30,766 --> 00:47:32,733
All right.

490
00:47:38,466 --> 00:47:42,633
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck...

491
00:47:42,666 --> 00:47:44,400
Fuck.

492
00:47:44,433 --> 00:47:45,466
Fuck!

493
00:47:51,533 --> 00:47:55,733
No. God.
Fuck.

494
00:47:55,766 --> 00:47:59,433
Okay, okay.

495
00:47:59,466 --> 00:48:01,400
God damn it!

496
00:48:01,433 --> 00:48:02,533
Otis?

497
00:48:03,933 --> 00:48:06,400
I just need
some fucking high ground.

498
00:48:10,666 --> 00:48:13,466
Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.

499
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:14,733
Fuck!

500
00:48:14,766 --> 00:48:16,500
Fuck. Fuck.

501
00:48:16,533 --> 00:48:18,666
Fuck, fuck,
fuck, fuck.

502
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:22,700
Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.

503
00:48:24,300 --> 00:48:26,866
Fuck.
Fuck, otis.

504
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:28,833
I hope you get eaten
by a fuckin' bear,

505
00:48:28,866 --> 00:48:30,533
You piece of shit.

506
00:48:30,566 --> 00:48:32,200
Fuckin' idiot.

507
00:48:32,233 --> 00:48:33,500
I'm gonna
fuckin' wound you,

508
00:48:33,533 --> 00:48:35,966
You fuckin'...

509
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,266
Otis!

510
00:48:44,533 --> 00:48:46,833
Hello!

511
00:48:55,866 --> 00:49:00,266
Hello?

512
00:49:00,300 --> 00:49:01,600
Fuck.

513
00:49:01,633 --> 00:49:03,333
Fuck.

514
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,266
Hello?

515
00:49:08,333 --> 00:49:09,800
- Hello?
- Hey!

516
00:49:09,833 --> 00:49:11,266

517
00:49:11,300 --> 00:49:13,966
I'm over here.
I'm lost!

518
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
Have you guys
seen a dog?

519
00:49:16,033 --> 00:49:17,633
No.

520
00:49:17,666 --> 00:49:19,966
We heard you screaming
all the way from the lake.

521
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,633
Sorry.

522
00:49:21,666 --> 00:49:24,666
My dog ran away
and... it's not even my dog.

523
00:49:24,700 --> 00:49:28,000
I am totally lost.

524
00:49:28,033 --> 00:49:29,700
- I'm luke.
- I'm will.

525
00:49:29,733 --> 00:49:31,566
- My sister, christie.
- Hey.

526
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:33,500
So, where're you camping?

527
00:49:33,533 --> 00:49:35,666
My family owns a...

528
00:49:35,700 --> 00:49:37,333
Cabin up on echo lake.

529
00:49:37,366 --> 00:49:38,866
What cabin?

530
00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:41,000
Ah, it's the baxter cabin.

531
00:49:41,033 --> 00:49:42,900
You're bill's kid?

532
00:49:42,933 --> 00:49:45,900
We see him at the bait
and tackle shop every summer.

533
00:49:45,933 --> 00:49:48,833
- How's he doing?
- He's good.

534
00:49:48,866 --> 00:49:51,033
Do you guys
have any water?

535
00:49:51,066 --> 00:49:52,566
You don't have any water?

536
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:54,500
Jesus.
Yeah, here.

537
00:49:54,533 --> 00:49:56,600
Oh, my gosh.
I need this.

538
00:49:56,633 --> 00:49:58,300
I don't have cooties.

539
00:50:03,433 --> 00:50:04,900
You have to bite
the nipple.

540
00:50:04,933 --> 00:50:07,000
The what?

541
00:50:07,033 --> 00:50:09,533
You have to bite the nipple
and then suck.

542
00:50:10,866 --> 00:50:12,600
Here.
I'll show you.

543
00:50:14,066 --> 00:50:16,833
Mm. Got it.
Thank you.

544
00:50:19,933 --> 00:50:21,400
Let's get back
to the tent.

545
00:50:22,766 --> 00:50:25,033
Oh, thank you.
Thank you so much.

546
00:50:25,066 --> 00:50:26,833
Is your dad
waiting for you at the cabin?

547
00:50:26,866 --> 00:50:28,966
No, i came up here alone.

548
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,000
Oh?

549
00:50:32,133 --> 00:50:34,366
- I feel really bad
taking this.
- It's fine.

550
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:35,776
You guys are gonna be
in echo tomorrow.

551
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:37,733
- I can probably...
- You're good.

552
00:50:37,766 --> 00:50:39,900
And you're gonna stay
on the trail this time, right?

553
00:50:39,933 --> 00:50:41,666
I am gonna stay
right on the trail, yeah.

554
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:43,600
Like i said,
we can make some room.

555
00:50:43,633 --> 00:50:45,542
- You can stay
in the tent tonight.
- No, thank you.

556
00:50:45,566 --> 00:50:48,100
You guys have done enough.
Seriously.

557
00:50:48,133 --> 00:50:49,100
Take it easy.

558
00:50:49,133 --> 00:50:50,366
And if we find otis

559
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:51,366
We'll get him back to you.

560
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:53,133
Thank you.

561
00:50:53,166 --> 00:50:54,766
It's good
meeting you, man.

562
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:55,866
You take care.

563
00:50:55,900 --> 00:50:57,533
It was good meeting you.

564
00:50:57,566 --> 00:50:59,900
You, too.
Don't die.

565
00:50:59,933 --> 00:51:02,533
I will try not to.

566
00:51:20,533 --> 00:51:22,800
Hey, billy!

567
00:51:22,833 --> 00:51:25,433
Billy! It's roger.

568
00:51:29,133 --> 00:51:31,400
- Billy, it's roger.
- Fuck.

569
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:38,133
Sorry to wake you up.

570
00:51:38,166 --> 00:51:39,933
Oh, no, i'm awake.

571
00:51:39,966 --> 00:51:42,633
What's a vacation for
if you can't take a nap?

572
00:51:42,666 --> 00:51:44,433
Am i right?

573
00:51:48,666 --> 00:51:49,833
Did you need anything?

574
00:51:49,866 --> 00:51:51,466
- Or?
- Oh, um,

575
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:54,000
Yeah, i just brought over
otis's toy.

576
00:51:54,033 --> 00:51:55,666
It just slipped my mind

577
00:51:55,700 --> 00:51:57,866
When i was packing up
his stuff the other day.

578
00:51:57,900 --> 00:51:59,966
Oh...

579
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,533
That's great.

580
00:52:01,566 --> 00:52:02,633
He really
loves that thing.

581
00:52:04,833 --> 00:52:07,166
So, where's otis?

582
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:09,433
Oh, actually,

583
00:52:09,466 --> 00:52:11,966
Brendan,
my younger brother,

584
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:16,666
He stopped by yesterday
and we decided

585
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:19,166
He'd be better off with him,
'cause he's got kids.

586
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:21,833
So, yeah,
i just think...

587
00:52:21,866 --> 00:52:24,533
All right.
It sounds like
it's for the best.

588
00:52:24,566 --> 00:52:25,900
Yeah, it definitely is,

589
00:52:25,933 --> 00:52:27,900
And... and i'm gonna
get this to them,

590
00:52:27,933 --> 00:52:29,166
'Cause
they're gonna love it.

591
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:32,200
Well,

592
00:52:32,233 --> 00:52:35,200
You know,
we got a pot of chili

593
00:52:35,233 --> 00:52:36,733
On the stove
and me and the wife

594
00:52:36,766 --> 00:52:39,600
Can always use a third
for pinochle.

595
00:52:39,633 --> 00:52:43,533
Oh, all right.
Great, good.

596
00:52:43,566 --> 00:52:45,200
Okay, take it easy.

597
00:52:45,233 --> 00:52:46,833
Thanks, roger.

598
00:53:24,666 --> 00:53:27,166
Otis,
you fucking ass clown.

599
00:53:28,933 --> 00:53:32,233
We coulda been
besties, otis.

600
00:53:32,266 --> 00:53:34,000
We coulda been besties,
otis.

601
00:53:55,666 --> 00:53:56,966
Hey.

602
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,600
I saw a campfire
over here.

603
00:53:58,633 --> 00:54:00,566
I thought it might be
you guys.

604
00:54:01,933 --> 00:54:04,233
Oh, yes.
Thank you.

605
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:09,233
Oh, here
is your flashlight.

606
00:54:09,266 --> 00:54:11,733
Oh...
thank you.

607
00:54:11,766 --> 00:54:15,000
Did you find you, um,
uh, otis?

608
00:54:15,033 --> 00:54:16,866
- Did you find otis?
- No.

609
00:54:16,900 --> 00:54:19,333
- Oh.
- Chris, you coming?

610
00:54:19,366 --> 00:54:20,966
Well... hey,
you wanna come hang out?

611
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,633
We have a campfire going.

612
00:54:22,666 --> 00:54:24,633
Yeah.
That sounds great.

613
00:54:24,666 --> 00:54:26,233
Okay, cool.
Come on.

614
00:54:28,866 --> 00:54:30,100
Right this way.

615
00:54:33,833 --> 00:54:35,900
I used to come up here a lot
when i was younger.

616
00:54:35,933 --> 00:54:37,333
Probably stopped
coming up

617
00:54:37,366 --> 00:54:39,300
When i was about
16 or so.

618
00:54:39,333 --> 00:54:40,566
So...

619
00:54:42,233 --> 00:54:44,933
Party time.

620
00:54:46,766 --> 00:54:48,900
That was a healthy riff.

621
00:54:48,933 --> 00:54:51,666
I'm a healthy individual.

622
00:54:51,700 --> 00:54:55,066
I would kill
for a cabin like yours.

623
00:54:55,100 --> 00:54:57,733
I would kill.

624
00:54:57,766 --> 00:54:59,600
- I know.
- It's beautiful.

625
00:54:59,633 --> 00:55:00,733
But...

626
00:55:02,366 --> 00:55:04,666
My memories of the place

627
00:55:04,700 --> 00:55:07,633
Are of me stuck
in a tiny cabin

628
00:55:07,666 --> 00:55:09,200
With my dad.

629
00:55:09,233 --> 00:55:10,333
So.

630
00:55:10,366 --> 00:55:12,700
Could it really be
that bad?

631
00:55:12,733 --> 00:55:15,233
Well, my dad
was a little bit

632
00:55:15,266 --> 00:55:16,966
Of an alcoholic.

633
00:55:25,100 --> 00:55:27,333
I don't know.

634
00:55:27,366 --> 00:55:29,766
I probably sound like
an ungrateful asshole
saying this,

635
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:31,633
But i feel like
leaving it to me

636
00:55:31,666 --> 00:55:33,600
Was just his final
"fuck you."

637
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:39,400
And it's embarrassing...

638
00:55:39,433 --> 00:55:42,233
But i really
just wanted his money.

639
00:55:45,766 --> 00:55:47,033
What?

640
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
- What?
- I'm sorry.

641
00:55:52,033 --> 00:55:53,266
I'm really high.

642
00:55:53,300 --> 00:55:54,733
Whose money?

643
00:55:59,433 --> 00:56:01,666
Sorry, uh...

644
00:56:03,433 --> 00:56:04,833
See, i kinda left
that part out.

645
00:56:04,866 --> 00:56:07,400
- What part?
- Uh,

646
00:56:07,433 --> 00:56:10,100
The reason i'm up here

647
00:56:10,133 --> 00:56:12,966
Is, uh,

648
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:14,700
Is my, um,

649
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:18,733
My dad died

650
00:56:18,766 --> 00:56:20,333
Like a couple weeks ago.

651
00:56:22,733 --> 00:56:25,000
He left me the cabin
in his will.

652
00:56:27,733 --> 00:56:30,400
I definitely
left that part out.

653
00:56:30,433 --> 00:56:31,866
Sorry.

654
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:39,433
No, it's cool.
Like we, we didn't talk.

655
00:56:39,466 --> 00:56:41,266
So.

656
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:48,066
My dad was right.

657
00:56:50,166 --> 00:56:52,833
I am
fucking irresponsible.

658
00:56:52,866 --> 00:56:54,866
I have otis
for two days

659
00:56:54,900 --> 00:56:56,166
And i lose him.

660
00:56:57,500 --> 00:56:58,933
Then let's find him.

661
00:57:00,366 --> 00:57:02,066
It doesn't
do much good to just

662
00:57:02,100 --> 00:57:04,000
Feel sorry for yourself
all the time.

663
00:57:04,033 --> 00:57:05,800
Right?

664
00:57:05,833 --> 00:57:07,833
Did i just seem like
i feel sorry for myself?

665
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,833
- Sort of.
- Look.

666
00:57:12,866 --> 00:57:15,166
We'll go with you tomorrow
and if nothing else

667
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:18,333
You can rehash the rest
of your fucked up childhood.

668
00:57:18,366 --> 00:57:20,966
So, you'll have
that to look forward to.

669
00:57:23,466 --> 00:57:25,033
Sold.

670
00:57:48,900 --> 00:57:51,000
- Otis!
- Otis!

671
00:58:13,066 --> 00:58:14,800
So, we're about
a half mile north

672
00:58:14,833 --> 00:58:16,400
From where we found you,
so i figure

673
00:58:16,433 --> 00:58:18,366
He's somewhere
between here,

674
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:20,466
Lava beds, cinder fields,
and all that.

675
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:21,540
I have no idea
how the fuck

676
00:58:21,566 --> 00:58:22,866
You know
where we are right now.

677
00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:24,533
I'm totally lost.

678
00:58:24,566 --> 00:58:27,200
You should really learn
how to use a compass.

679
00:58:27,233 --> 00:58:28,900
Is that like on a cell phone
or something?

680
00:58:30,433 --> 00:58:32,100
Otis!

681
00:58:34,100 --> 00:58:35,900
- Otis!
- Otis!

682
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:41,000
Otis!

683
00:58:52,966 --> 00:58:54,566
Wow!

684
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:56,533
Well, this is crazy.

685
00:58:56,566 --> 00:58:58,200
I'm having flashbacks
of my dad

686
00:58:58,233 --> 00:59:00,066
Skinny dipping
in this lake.

687
00:59:02,666 --> 00:59:04,466
Not a good flashback
to have.

688
00:59:09,900 --> 00:59:13,600
Ah, what is she doing?

689
00:59:13,633 --> 00:59:14,900
Lighten up, kid.

690
00:59:14,933 --> 00:59:16,366
Okay.

691
00:59:28,633 --> 00:59:31,100
Come on in.
It's warmer than echo.

692
00:59:31,133 --> 00:59:32,600
- Whoo!
- I swear on money, though.

693
00:59:33,700 --> 00:59:35,166
Woo-Hoo!

694
00:59:37,166 --> 00:59:38,900
Come in here, you pussy.

695
00:59:38,933 --> 00:59:41,100
Get them panties off
and get in here, boy!

696
00:59:41,133 --> 00:59:42,866
You guys are weird.

697
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:45,900
So what.

698
00:59:47,333 --> 00:59:49,266
Come on!

699
00:59:55,166 --> 00:59:57,000
- Don't you start.
- What?

700
00:59:57,033 --> 01:00:00,333
You know what.

701
01:00:00,366 --> 01:00:02,366
Woo-Hoo.
Look who's in the water.

702
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:03,866
Woo.

703
01:00:05,700 --> 01:00:06,900
Woo!

704
01:00:10,700 --> 01:00:12,700
- Really?
- Yeah.

705
01:00:12,733 --> 01:00:14,233
Google in my brain.

706
01:00:14,266 --> 01:00:16,233
Credit card swiper
on my wrist.

707
01:00:16,266 --> 01:00:18,000
Put it in my already
or something.

708
01:00:18,033 --> 01:00:21,266
- That is frightening.
- Seriously, at that point,

709
01:00:21,300 --> 01:00:24,600
You can just upload your mind
to a server somewhere

710
01:00:24,633 --> 01:00:27,633
- And live forever.
- Like in the internet
or something.

711
01:00:27,666 --> 01:00:29,633
Yeah, the internet,
a robot.

712
01:00:29,666 --> 01:00:31,633
You can put a brain
in another body.

713
01:00:31,666 --> 01:00:33,966
Hell, i wouldn't mind
putting my brain in your body

714
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,466
And having that.

715
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:39,066
- It'd be awesome.
- We are not the weird ones.

716
01:00:39,100 --> 01:00:40,400
I mean, seriously.

717
01:00:40,433 --> 01:00:42,233
It seems like
the next logical step.

718
01:00:42,266 --> 01:00:43,266
No?

719
01:00:44,500 --> 01:00:47,400
I mean, fuck.

720
01:00:47,433 --> 01:00:49,433
Death terrifies me.

721
01:00:50,733 --> 01:00:53,400
I mean, like,
just think about it.

722
01:00:53,433 --> 01:00:57,366
Like, at some point,
everything is just like,

723
01:00:57,400 --> 01:00:59,400
Done.

724
01:00:59,433 --> 01:01:00,966
Forever.

725
01:01:03,233 --> 01:01:05,066
You're a real splash
of sunshine, kid.

726
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:08,600
I understand that, though.

727
01:01:08,633 --> 01:01:11,566
I mean,
i distinctly remember

728
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:12,633
What it felt like

729
01:01:12,666 --> 01:01:15,566
When i realized
i was gonna die.

730
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:17,109
I used to crawl in bed
with mom and dad

731
01:01:17,133 --> 01:01:18,400
And just sob.

732
01:01:27,733 --> 01:01:30,433
I am being
a total buzzkill.

733
01:01:30,466 --> 01:01:31,766
No, i mean, it's okay.

734
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:35,666
- Are you guys hungry?
- Yes, i am starving.

735
01:01:37,066 --> 01:01:38,633
Well, get excited.

736
01:01:43,466 --> 01:01:45,133
Are these gonna be
edible or what?

737
01:01:45,166 --> 01:01:46,400
It sounds disgusting.

738
01:01:46,433 --> 01:01:48,133
- It does.
- Like, really gross.

739
01:01:48,166 --> 01:01:50,666
Barbeque sauce makes
everything better.

740
01:01:50,700 --> 01:01:52,266
Even mac and cheese.

741
01:01:52,300 --> 01:01:53,766
- Luke, enjoy.
- Thanks.

742
01:01:53,800 --> 01:01:55,300
Big or little?
Big, right?

743
01:01:55,333 --> 01:01:58,666
- None, thank you.
- So i heard big.

744
01:01:58,700 --> 01:02:00,400
I'm not eating it
until he tries it.

745
01:02:01,533 --> 01:02:02,800
- Okay.
- Talk to me.

746
01:02:02,833 --> 01:02:04,442
- Ready? Here he goes.
- That looks gross.

747
01:02:04,466 --> 01:02:05,766
It looks like
you don't like it.

748
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:07,733
Could you shut up?

749
01:02:07,766 --> 01:02:10,733
- Watch what's about to happen.
- This is fucking delicious.

750
01:02:10,766 --> 01:02:12,366
You think
everything's delicious.

751
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:15,200
Tastes like someone threw
macaroni and cheese

752
01:02:15,233 --> 01:02:17,566
On the barbeque
and just grilled it up.

753
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:19,200
All right.

754
01:02:21,833 --> 01:02:23,433
Hold on.
Drum roll.

755
01:02:27,700 --> 01:02:29,500
- It's smokey.
- Yes!

756
01:02:29,533 --> 01:02:30,609
I heard good.
I heard great.

757
01:02:30,633 --> 01:02:32,133
It's smokey.

758
01:02:32,166 --> 01:02:33,533
- There you go.
- It's good.

759
01:02:33,566 --> 01:02:35,233
Recipe from my dad.

760
01:02:35,266 --> 01:02:37,766
So, he did leave us
with this.

761
01:02:37,800 --> 01:02:40,400
Family recipe.
Family recipe.

762
01:02:40,433 --> 01:02:41,600
Here, here.

763
01:02:43,300 --> 01:02:45,433
Mm.

764
01:02:45,466 --> 01:02:47,700
Just slow down.

765
01:02:47,733 --> 01:02:49,500
Ah, i missed a drop.

766
01:02:49,533 --> 01:02:51,833
Mm, don't worry about me.

767
01:02:51,866 --> 01:02:54,533
I have a bit
of a tolerance.

768
01:02:54,566 --> 01:02:56,500
- Yeah?
- My ex-Girlfriend

769
01:02:56,533 --> 01:02:58,633
Actually called me
a functioning alcoholic once.

770
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:02,633
Well, are you one?

771
01:03:05,433 --> 01:03:07,066
That's a good question.

772
01:03:08,600 --> 01:03:11,266
Like, two years ago,
i actually stopped drinking

773
01:03:11,300 --> 01:03:12,733
For like, three months.

774
01:03:14,866 --> 01:03:17,166
Then i wanted
to drink again.

775
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:19,133
So i did.
Here i am.

776
01:03:22,900 --> 01:03:25,866
I have to take a leak.

777
01:03:25,900 --> 01:03:28,200
Ah-Hah.
There's a bathroom yonder,

778
01:03:28,233 --> 01:03:31,366
But, really,
anywhere and everywhere.

779
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:32,600
That's what
i've been doing.

780
01:03:32,633 --> 01:03:34,333
I like it.

781
01:03:35,900 --> 01:03:37,400
Do you want
another drink?

782
01:03:37,433 --> 01:03:39,266
No, thank you.

783
01:03:39,300 --> 01:03:41,533
I'm good.

784
01:03:41,566 --> 01:03:47,200
So, he works at the bait
and tackle place...

785
01:03:47,233 --> 01:03:49,200
What do you do?

786
01:03:49,233 --> 01:03:50,733
Well, i'm in...
i'm in school.

787
01:03:50,766 --> 01:03:52,533
- Down in chico.
- Mm.

788
01:03:52,566 --> 01:03:54,600
I'm studying
marine biology.

789
01:03:54,633 --> 01:03:56,666
Wow.

790
01:03:56,700 --> 01:03:58,466
Impressive.

791
01:03:58,500 --> 01:03:59,909
I don't really have
anything pithy to say

792
01:03:59,933 --> 01:04:01,833
- About marine biology.
- Yeah, i bet you don't.

793
01:04:06,633 --> 01:04:08,466
So,

794
01:04:08,500 --> 01:04:10,833
Tell me about
your ex-Girlfriend.

795
01:04:13,433 --> 01:04:15,933
Sisters, ladies.

796
01:04:15,966 --> 01:04:18,200
Who would like
to smoke a bowl?

797
01:04:18,233 --> 01:04:20,366
I'm good.
Thank you.

798
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:22,933
Willy boy, willy-Billy?

799
01:04:22,966 --> 01:04:24,700
I'm pretty faded, man.

800
01:04:24,733 --> 01:04:25,933
You enjoy.

801
01:04:25,966 --> 01:04:27,266
You are a bunch
of children.

802
01:04:27,300 --> 01:04:28,633
I despise you.

803
01:04:33,666 --> 01:04:36,233
So...

804
01:04:36,266 --> 01:04:38,700
You wanted to know
about my girlfriend.

805
01:04:40,566 --> 01:04:44,333
Well, is she your girlfriend
or your ex-Girlfriend?

806
01:04:44,366 --> 01:04:46,300
Ex, i think.

807
01:04:46,333 --> 01:04:47,500
You think?

808
01:04:50,300 --> 01:04:52,666
Hell, yes.
Definitely ex.

809
01:04:52,700 --> 01:04:54,166
Definitely ex.

810
01:04:58,333 --> 01:04:59,900
- What?
- What?

811
01:05:01,966 --> 01:05:03,733
You're giving me
the stone cold stare down

812
01:05:03,766 --> 01:05:05,800
Over there.

813
01:05:05,833 --> 01:05:08,300
Well, my brother's
only gonna be gone
for like another minute.

814
01:05:08,333 --> 01:05:10,866
So if you wanna kiss me
you should probably do it now.

815
01:05:12,866 --> 01:05:13,866
Oh.

816
01:05:14,933 --> 01:05:16,366
Okay.

817
01:05:26,600 --> 01:05:28,233
Sorry about my breath.

818
01:05:28,266 --> 01:05:30,800
Macaroni and barbecue sauce
is really disgusting.

819
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:35,966
That weed is phenomenal.

820
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:37,400
Ah, i gotta stretch.

821
01:05:37,433 --> 01:05:39,700
Where do you
get that stuff?

822
01:05:39,733 --> 01:05:43,400
Ah, from...

823
01:05:43,433 --> 01:05:44,700
The weed dispensary.

824
01:05:44,733 --> 01:05:46,966
The disp...

825
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,966
I go to charles
who lives on ninth.

826
01:05:51,900 --> 01:05:53,866
He lives in
like, this shack...

827
01:05:53,900 --> 01:05:56,566
This ramshackle shack.

828
01:05:56,600 --> 01:05:58,366
Ramshackle...

829
01:06:14,733 --> 01:06:16,733
Two to your credit.

830
01:06:16,766 --> 01:06:19,500
And another ace.

831
01:06:19,533 --> 01:06:21,633
How did that happen?
I don't know.

832
01:06:21,666 --> 01:06:23,633
What is this?
How many aces do i get?

833
01:06:23,666 --> 01:06:25,676
You do know i've been cheating
the whole time, right?

834
01:06:25,700 --> 01:06:26,933
I'm letting you win.

835
01:06:26,966 --> 01:06:28,400
I worked very hard
to cheat.

836
01:06:29,600 --> 01:06:31,266
Good lord.

837
01:06:33,600 --> 01:06:35,566
It's been like this
every single night.

838
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:40,366
Jesus christ,
it's like a fucking bear.

839
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:42,466
- It's like a bear!
- Wake up. Shh!

840
01:06:42,500 --> 01:06:44,366
You don't think
your brother's a bear?

841
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:46,833
Shh! Don't wake daddy.

842
01:06:46,866 --> 01:06:48,066
Daddy?

843
01:06:48,100 --> 01:06:50,933
Fucking daddy
needs a muzzle.

844
01:06:50,966 --> 01:06:52,400
Are we done
with this fucking game?

845
01:06:52,433 --> 01:06:53,766
Mm-Hmm.

846
01:07:26,833 --> 01:07:30,933
"Silver lake, 1974.

847
01:07:30,966 --> 01:07:34,100
"Roland and i drove out
to hike up susan river

848
01:07:34,133 --> 01:07:36,600
To silver lake.

849
01:07:36,633 --> 01:07:40,933
We got an early start
and hit the river at dawn.

850
01:07:40,966 --> 01:07:43,800
The water was brisk,
but it was a hot one.

851
01:07:43,833 --> 01:07:45,500
So the cold water
was welcomed

852
01:07:45,533 --> 01:07:47,833
By the time noon or one
rolled around,

853
01:07:47,866 --> 01:07:51,066
And we took several
swim breaks on the way up."

854
01:08:02,700 --> 01:08:04,133
You know,

855
01:08:04,166 --> 01:08:07,800
I don't know you,
like, at all.

856
01:08:07,833 --> 01:08:10,866
But i really feel like
if you just forgave him

857
01:08:10,900 --> 01:08:12,166
For all that stuff

858
01:08:12,200 --> 01:08:14,700
That you'd feel
so much better.

859
01:08:17,066 --> 01:08:18,666
I mean...

860
01:08:21,200 --> 01:08:23,866
Neither of you
can win anymore.

861
01:08:23,900 --> 01:08:25,033
You know?

862
01:08:29,200 --> 01:08:32,500
Where did you come from?

863
01:08:32,533 --> 01:08:35,133
Chester motherfucking,
california.

864
01:08:37,900 --> 01:08:41,633
You know chuck norris
vacations in chester?

865
01:08:43,033 --> 01:08:45,466
From my understanding,

866
01:08:45,500 --> 01:08:51,700
Chester vacations
in chuck norris, actually.

867
01:08:51,733 --> 01:08:53,666
I don't understand
what that means.

868
01:08:53,700 --> 01:08:54,933
- No?
- Mm-Mm.

869
01:08:54,966 --> 01:08:57,066
Think on it.
It's really funny.

870
01:08:59,100 --> 01:09:00,633
I don't know
if you know this,

871
01:09:00,666 --> 01:09:02,233
But it's a full moon
this evening.

872
01:09:02,266 --> 01:09:03,766
Mm.

873
01:09:03,800 --> 01:09:05,900
- Is it?
- Yes. Shh!

874
01:09:05,933 --> 01:09:07,900
And i was thinking
that it might be really fun

875
01:09:07,933 --> 01:09:09,233
To take your boat out,

876
01:09:09,266 --> 01:09:12,766
Because the lake
is all lit up

877
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:14,900
And that'd be really cool.

878
01:09:17,266 --> 01:09:18,700
You wanna go?

879
01:09:28,766 --> 01:09:30,933
Actually,
i'm kind of,

880
01:09:30,966 --> 01:09:32,233
I probably should crash.

881
01:09:32,266 --> 01:09:33,266
I'm...

882
01:09:35,166 --> 01:09:38,100
Kind of tired,
if that's cool with you.

883
01:09:39,566 --> 01:09:41,666
Not really
an ex-Girlfriend, huh?

884
01:09:44,600 --> 01:09:46,033
I just shouldn't.

885
01:09:49,200 --> 01:09:51,800
Okay.
I understand.

886
01:09:54,300 --> 01:09:57,566
That's good.
Good.

887
01:09:57,600 --> 01:09:59,000
That's good.

888
01:10:01,166 --> 01:10:02,600
All right.

889
01:10:02,633 --> 01:10:05,266
Well, in that case.

890
01:10:05,300 --> 01:10:07,300
Hmm.

891
01:10:07,333 --> 01:10:09,933
It looks like you, sir,

892
01:10:09,966 --> 01:10:14,066
Are sleeping
with daddy tonight.

893
01:10:14,100 --> 01:10:15,766
Have fun.

894
01:10:15,800 --> 01:10:17,900
Good night.

895
01:10:26,866 --> 01:10:27,966
Fuck.

896
01:11:04,233 --> 01:11:05,233
Will?

897
01:11:06,366 --> 01:11:09,200
Will, hey.

898
01:11:09,233 --> 01:11:11,066
- Hey.
- We have to get a start.

899
01:11:11,100 --> 01:11:13,700
Christie's got
to bartend tonight.

900
01:11:13,733 --> 01:11:17,100
Hmm, okay.

901
01:11:17,133 --> 01:11:18,166
Great to meet you, boss.

902
01:11:18,200 --> 01:11:20,633
You, too.
Thanks.

903
01:11:22,033 --> 01:11:23,700
You should look us up
on facebook.

904
01:11:23,733 --> 01:11:26,933
- Or something.
- Yeah, definitely.

905
01:11:26,966 --> 01:11:30,300
- You guys want any water
or anything?
- Thanks.

906
01:11:30,333 --> 01:11:31,633
- It's all good.
- For your trip?

907
01:11:31,666 --> 01:11:33,133
- Thanks again.
- So,

908
01:11:33,166 --> 01:11:35,833
See you here
next summer, huh?

909
01:11:35,866 --> 01:11:36,966
Yeah.

910
01:11:50,833 --> 01:11:53,166
It didn't take much, you know,
my roommate was like,

911
01:11:53,200 --> 01:11:55,800
"You want some acid? No.
You want some acid? No.

912
01:11:55,833 --> 01:11:58,000
Do you want some acid?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

913
01:11:58,033 --> 01:12:01,033
- I'll take some acid."
- I took her with me.

914
01:12:01,066 --> 01:12:02,366
It was my first time
taking acid.

915
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:04,900
So, it was, uh,
i was on holiday,

916
01:12:04,933 --> 01:12:06,900
As that may be said, yeah.

917
01:12:06,933 --> 01:12:08,933
Don't jump in that shit.

918
01:12:08,966 --> 01:12:10,066
- Don't jump...
- Gross!

919
01:12:10,100 --> 01:12:12,066
- Come on, get in there.
- Gross.

920
01:12:12,100 --> 01:12:13,933
Let our...
let our odors

921
01:12:13,966 --> 01:12:16,766
Intermingle as one.

922
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:19,200
You are a sick fuck,
william.

923
01:12:19,233 --> 01:12:21,733
Exactly.

924
01:12:21,766 --> 01:12:23,066
That's why you love me.

925
01:12:23,100 --> 01:12:25,033
That is not why
i love you.

926
01:12:25,066 --> 01:12:27,900
Oh, yeah?
Then why do you love me?

927
01:12:27,933 --> 01:12:29,366
Don't worry about it.

928
01:12:39,866 --> 01:12:41,433
I will start on top,
but this time,

929
01:12:41,466 --> 01:12:44,466
You are doing
the heavy lifting, mister.

930
01:12:44,500 --> 01:12:47,233
Spoken like a true member
of generation "me."

931
01:12:48,966 --> 01:12:51,733
You know,
actually i love you.

932
01:12:51,766 --> 01:12:53,733
Because you are a smart
little fuck.

933
01:12:54,933 --> 01:12:57,133
But sometimes,

934
01:12:57,166 --> 01:12:58,866
You talk too much.

935
01:13:03,800 --> 01:13:05,733
You are not getting
any tonight.

936
01:13:05,766 --> 01:13:08,300
- What?
- No, no, no!

937
01:13:56,233 --> 01:13:57,966
Woo!

938
01:14:08,566 --> 01:14:10,533
Otis! Otis!

939
01:14:10,566 --> 01:14:12,900
Oh, boy!
Oh, my god!

940
01:14:12,933 --> 01:14:14,200
That's a good boy.

941
01:14:14,233 --> 01:14:16,333
Oh, you motherfucker.
Yes! Yeah.

942
01:14:18,100 --> 01:14:21,433
Think i found something
that belongs to you, son.

943
01:14:24,500 --> 01:14:26,333
Roger...

944
01:14:26,366 --> 01:14:28,033
I fucked up.

945
01:14:28,066 --> 01:14:31,233
Listen, i'll be glad
to take him

946
01:14:31,266 --> 01:14:33,533
- If that's what you want.
- No, i...

947
01:14:33,566 --> 01:14:35,400
I am never gonna let him
out of my sight.

948
01:14:35,433 --> 01:14:37,100
I am so sorry.

949
01:14:37,133 --> 01:14:39,600
Well, he's a good dog,
isn't he?

950
01:14:39,633 --> 01:14:42,433
He's a great dog.

951
01:14:42,466 --> 01:14:44,966
- You know, uh...
- You're a good boy, yes.

952
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,533
I don't mean to butt into
anybody's business

953
01:14:47,566 --> 01:14:50,033
But your dad told me

954
01:14:50,066 --> 01:14:53,133
That you two
weren't exactly the closest.

955
01:14:55,266 --> 01:14:58,133
I think you should know
that he knew

956
01:14:58,166 --> 01:15:00,233
That he made
some mistakes.

957
01:15:00,266 --> 01:15:01,800
You know?

958
01:15:03,133 --> 01:15:04,200
Yeah.

959
01:15:07,100 --> 01:15:09,200
Well, see you around.

960
01:15:53,966 --> 01:15:55,033
Otis.

961
01:16:39,200 --> 01:16:40,933
Hello? What? Wha...

962
01:16:40,966 --> 01:16:42,166
Okay.

963
01:16:42,200 --> 01:16:44,333
Today is january 8th

964
01:16:44,366 --> 01:16:47,200
- 1980...
- Mom, do... do that.

965
01:16:47,233 --> 01:16:48,666
It is. It's on.

966
01:16:48,700 --> 01:16:50,466
It's on.
It's taping now.

967
01:16:52,300 --> 01:16:53,633
One second, there.

968
01:16:53,666 --> 01:16:55,700
No, no, just wait.

969
01:16:55,733 --> 01:16:58,333
Okay, just wait.

970
01:16:58,366 --> 01:17:01,000
Okay,
what is less frightening?

971
01:17:01,033 --> 01:17:03,533
Just let us wait.

972
01:17:03,566 --> 01:17:05,166
Okay, we'll wait.

973
01:17:05,200 --> 01:17:06,966
Okay.

974
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,500
What do you think will happen
when we wait?

975
01:17:09,533 --> 01:17:13,700
I will sing. No?

976
01:17:13,733 --> 01:17:15,500
No, not until you do.

977
01:17:15,533 --> 01:17:18,033
You're gonna have
to sing first.

978
01:17:18,066 --> 01:17:19,666
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

979
01:17:19,700 --> 01:17:21,566
- Jane?
- What?

980
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:24,233
He's waiting
for the tape recording thing

981
01:17:24,266 --> 01:17:26,266
To talk before he does.

982
01:17:26,300 --> 01:17:27,633
I have to sing it first.

983
01:17:27,666 --> 01:17:29,466
- Okay?
- Okay.

984
01:17:29,500 --> 01:17:33,533
- The wheels are...
- No, no, no, don't.

985
01:17:33,566 --> 01:17:36,100
You... you just wait.

986
01:17:36,133 --> 01:17:37,400
Well, you have to sing it

987
01:17:37,433 --> 01:17:38,700
And then
it'll go on the tape.

988
01:17:38,733 --> 01:17:41,633
- Okay.
- Sing it now.

989
01:17:50,766 --> 01:17:53,400

01:17:53,433 --> 01:17:56,100
Mama! I wanna wait!

991
01:17:56,133 --> 01:17:58,433

until you sing.

01:17:58,466 --> 01:18:00,733
No, i'm... no, no.
I wanna wait.

993
01:18:00,766 --> 01:18:02,766
Say, you want me
to sing it first?

994
01:18:02,800 --> 01:18:05,633
- No... yeah.
- And then you can
listen to it? Okay.

995
01:19:17,533 --> 01:19:19,600
Hey, it's me.

996
01:19:19,633 --> 01:19:22,333
Where the fuck
are you, will?

997
01:19:22,366 --> 01:19:24,276
Look, i know you're giving me
the silent treatment

998
01:19:24,300 --> 01:19:25,600
Or whatever
the fuck this is,

999
01:19:25,633 --> 01:19:29,400
But i really need
to talk to you.

1000
01:19:31,533 --> 01:19:33,900
My mom relapsed.

1001
01:19:33,933 --> 01:19:35,633
They said this time
it's stage four

1002
01:19:35,666 --> 01:19:37,433
So i don't think
they're even gonna do chemo.

1003
01:19:37,466 --> 01:19:39,166
Um...

1004
01:19:39,200 --> 01:19:41,533
Look, i'm going back home
to be with her and my dad.

1005
01:19:41,566 --> 01:19:45,666
So, i'm breaking the lease
on my apartment,

1006

I should...

1015
01:20:39,300 --> 01:20:42,466
I shoulda called
you back earlier.

1016
01:20:42,500 --> 01:20:43,733
I'm sorry.

1017
01:20:48,300 --> 01:20:49,933
I'm so sorry
about your mom.

1018
01:20:49,966 --> 01:20:51,566
I...

1019
01:20:51,600 --> 01:20:55,266
I wish i could've
been able to talk to you.

1020
01:20:59,333 --> 01:21:01,200
I'm sorry
about a lot of things.

1021
01:21:04,566 --> 01:21:07,700
My, uh...

1022
01:21:07,733 --> 01:21:11,300
My dad died

1023
01:21:11,333 --> 01:21:13,466
A week before
i left town.

1024
01:21:13,500 --> 01:21:15,733
And i should've
told you that.

1025
01:21:15,766 --> 01:21:17,800
I really should've, but...

1026
01:21:21,500 --> 01:21:23,600
I didn't know how.

1027
01:21:34,866 --> 01:21:37,400
I, uh,

1028
01:21:39,533 --> 01:21:44,700
I don't expect you
to forgive me.

1029
01:21:44,733 --> 01:21:48,233
But...

1030
01:21:50,866 --> 01:21:54,433
Just consider it please

1031
01:21:54,466 --> 01:21:56,300
Because i love you.

1032
01:22:00,733 --> 01:22:01,733
Okay.

1033
01:22:02,733 --> 01:22:03,933
Bye.
