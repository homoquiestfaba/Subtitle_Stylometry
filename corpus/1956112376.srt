1
00:01:08,833 --> 00:01:12,000
[man] I promise to be faithful
and loyal to Edward, King of England,

2
00:01:12,875 --> 00:01:16,667
to never again bear arms
against him or his... heirs.

3
00:01:16,792 --> 00:01:17,792
So help me God.

4
00:01:19,042 --> 00:01:20,042
[Edward] Stay there.

5
00:01:22,042 --> 00:01:24,625
Sir Robert, your father
is an old and valued friend,

6
00:01:24,958 --> 00:01:27,583
a great warrior who saved
my life in the Holy Land.

7
00:01:28,667 --> 00:01:32,000
You fought well for eight years,
but not always on the right side.

8
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:38,625
I welcome your renewed fealty,
and accept your submission.

9
00:01:39,208 --> 00:01:40,476
- Is that all?
- [man] Yes, Sire.

10
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:41,500
Good.

11
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:46,833
My lords of Scotland,
today you have each pledged fealty to me

12
00:01:46,917 --> 00:01:48,500
as your rightful overlord.

13
00:01:48,667 --> 00:01:52,833
Any lands confiscated during this conflict
will now be returned to you.

14
00:01:52,917 --> 00:01:56,708
- See? That wasn't so bad.
- [Edward] I hope you see the futility

15
00:01:56,792 --> 00:01:59,375
of your years of opposition,
and accept responsibility

16
00:01:59,458 --> 00:02:01,792
for the bloodshed
that could have been avoided.

17
00:02:02,542 --> 00:02:05,125
Lord John Comyn, Lord Robert Bruce...

18
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:06,958
[man] Step forward.

19
00:02:08,542 --> 00:02:12,667
[Edward] I understand both your families
have a strong claim on the Scottish crown.

20
00:02:13,042 --> 00:02:15,792
However, neither can be favored.
Therefore,

21
00:02:15,875 --> 00:02:19,708
England will continue to govern your
province and receive its due in taxes.

22
00:02:20,708 --> 00:02:24,458
- Our viceroy, Sir Aymer de Valence...
- Sire.

23
00:02:24,542 --> 00:02:27,542
[Edward]...will lead a new council
of Scottish administration.

24
00:02:27,833 --> 00:02:30,708
You both will be proud to serve under him,

25
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
and you will take that opportunity,

26
00:02:33,167 --> 00:02:36,917
if you are wise,
to heal the differences between you.

27
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,417
Offer your hands.

28
00:02:43,333 --> 00:02:45,958
Now let us be what we once were...

29
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:49,208
- friends!
- [noblemen cheering]

30
00:02:50,833 --> 00:02:54,000
Music! Drink! Feast!

31
00:02:54,833 --> 00:02:57,625
[whispering indistinctly]

32
00:03:00,583 --> 00:03:03,042
- [Edward] Rob!
- [Bruce Senior] Your Majesty...

33
00:03:05,333 --> 00:03:06,708
a memorable day, Sire.

34
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:12,875
[man] Robert!

35
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,292
That must have been painful for you.

36
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:23,833
[chuckles] I'm sure
I've had worse, Your Highness.

37
00:03:25,167 --> 00:03:28,583
Do you remember our summers
at Westminster, when I was a little boy?

38
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:32,250
Our footraces,
dueling with wooden swords.

39
00:03:33,167 --> 00:03:34,708
You were always so good at everything.

40
00:03:34,792 --> 00:03:36,917
That was just because
I was older than you.

41
00:03:38,625 --> 00:03:40,667
What would you say to a duel right now?

42
00:03:41,208 --> 00:03:42,417
Like old times?

43
00:03:43,542 --> 00:03:45,500
- And break my oath already?
- [chuckles]

44
00:03:45,583 --> 00:03:47,343
The order was to come unarmed,
Your Highness.

45
00:03:47,375 --> 00:03:48,375
Quiet.

46
00:03:51,333 --> 00:03:53,792
Let's say five pounds
to whomever wins leverage.

47
00:03:56,042 --> 00:03:57,417
Let's make it ten.

48
00:03:58,708 --> 00:04:00,833
I heard you'd developed
a taste for wagering.

49
00:04:00,917 --> 00:04:02,333
Piers, fetch him a sword.

50
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,333
[Prince of Wales] It's unfortunate
you had some sentimental notion

51
00:04:07,417 --> 00:04:10,417
of fighting for the people.
It's understandable.

52
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:11,750
Whoa!

53
00:04:11,833 --> 00:04:13,167
[crowd laughing]

54
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:15,958
- [man] Not a good start, Bruce.
- [man] Watch yourself, brother.

55
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,125
[Prince of Wales] Endearing, even.

56
00:04:20,083 --> 00:04:21,708
[crowd laughing]

57
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:23,833
I just wanted to win.

58
00:04:25,958 --> 00:04:26,958
So...

59
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,917
William Wallace...

60
00:04:30,958 --> 00:04:32,583
the last rebel standing.

61
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:42,792
- [both laughing]
- [man] Well done!

62
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:46,208
- [under his breath] Prick.
- How much have you had to drink?

63
00:04:46,542 --> 00:04:47,750
Not nearly enough.

64
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:49,750
[man] Keep the head, Robert.

65
00:04:49,958 --> 00:04:52,500
They say he lives in Selkirk Forest.

66
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,375
Some consider him a martyr...

67
00:04:58,167 --> 00:04:59,750
others, a madman.

68
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:02,625
What do you think?

69
00:05:09,042 --> 00:05:11,000
[breathing heavily]
I think he is a man

70
00:05:11,083 --> 00:05:14,292
who loves his country more than his life.

71
00:05:17,792 --> 00:05:19,542
[Prince of Wales] Diplomatically put.

72
00:05:21,375 --> 00:05:23,542
- [Robert sighing wearily]
- All right, fortunately,

73
00:05:23,625 --> 00:05:27,875
you Scottish nobles
don’t share that passion.

74
00:05:27,958 --> 00:05:30,750
- [Robert coughs]
- Or we’d have to kill you all.

75
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:35,708
[laughing]

76
00:05:38,167 --> 00:05:40,208
[man] James Douglas, stop!

77
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,750
[man] Your Majesty!

78
00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:48,208
[mimics] "Your Majesty!" What is it?

79
00:05:48,292 --> 00:05:50,583
[man] Your father,
he wishes to see you at once.

80
00:05:50,667 --> 00:05:52,467
[Prince of Wales] Shut up,
you sniveling fool!

81
00:05:52,542 --> 00:05:54,726
- [man] You're late.
- [man] You know how much this means to me.

82
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:56,875
Please, for once use your brain.
Stay there.

83
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,800
- Thank you, Bishop.
- I'll see what I can do.

84
00:05:58,833 --> 00:06:02,375
You're the one who was up all night,
clutching your chamber pot!

85
00:06:02,458 --> 00:06:04,458
[all laughing]

86
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,750
What the hell are you doing?

87
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:10,917
You have responsibilities.
We've had petitioners.

88
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:13,333
Sit down!

89
00:06:14,792 --> 00:06:16,333
When are you gonna grow up?

90
00:06:17,292 --> 00:06:21,083
Robert insisted we wager on swords.
And I have grown up.

91
00:06:22,042 --> 00:06:23,750
You just don’t like me very much.

92
00:06:24,542 --> 00:06:25,792
Pardon me, Sire.

93
00:06:26,958 --> 00:06:28,500
There is one last petitioner.

94
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:30,375
James Douglas.

95
00:06:32,667 --> 00:06:33,667
[Edward] <i>Douglas?</i>

96
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,125
Your Majesty,
I am the son of Sir William Douglas,

97
00:06:38,208 --> 00:06:39,888
who died a prisoner
in the Tower of London.

98
00:06:39,917 --> 00:06:41,357
Your father was a treacherous rebel.

99
00:06:41,417 --> 00:06:43,777
Our lands were seized
and gifted to Sir Richard de Clifford.

100
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:46,875
- Traitors forfeit their lands.
- That land, Sire, is my birthright.

101
00:06:46,958 --> 00:06:49,678
- You heard my father. Get out.
- You have balls, I'll give you that.

102
00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:51,625
Get out of here,

103
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,375
before I have them removed.

104
00:06:53,667 --> 00:06:56,500
Royal decree: I never want to hear
the name Douglas again.

105
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:58,167
[noblemen laughing]

106
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:00,833
I know this young man. I baptized him.

107
00:07:01,292 --> 00:07:03,167
Pardon me, Sire, for his insolence.

108
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:04,542
Go!

109
00:07:04,792 --> 00:07:06,934
- Do not push your luck today!
- [James] He can't do that!

110
00:07:06,958 --> 00:07:07,875
He slandered my name.

111
00:07:07,958 --> 00:07:09,976
[Edward] That's how you pass a camel
through the eye of a needle.

112
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,375
[Bruce Senior and Edward laughing]

113
00:07:11,458 --> 00:07:13,042
Sire, ready.

114
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:17,750
Good.

115
00:07:18,333 --> 00:07:20,583
Come! Rob, I have something to show you.

116
00:07:20,792 --> 00:07:23,792
[men shouting indistinctly]

117
00:07:24,417 --> 00:07:25,792
Friends, join us.

118
00:07:26,708 --> 00:07:28,250
We have a spectacle.

119
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:31,458
[fanfare playing]

120
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:42,208
Has there not been enough humiliation?

121
00:07:42,833 --> 00:07:45,458
Lord Oliphant tried to surrender
two days ago.

122
00:07:45,792 --> 00:07:47,292
Edward refused to accept.

123
00:07:47,458 --> 00:07:49,583
Wants to be certain we get the message.

124
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:51,667
[Edward] Robert.

125
00:07:52,042 --> 00:07:54,042
[drums beating]

126
00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:02,292
Everyone needs to understand
that this surrender is final.

127
00:08:03,417 --> 00:08:04,958
Light the Greek fire.

128
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:08,542
Also, it took three months to build,
so I don't want to waste it.

129
00:08:10,667 --> 00:08:12,250
[raised voice] My lords...

130
00:08:13,417 --> 00:08:14,625
and ladies...

131
00:08:16,958 --> 00:08:18,333
I give you...

132
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:20,625
the War Wolf.

133
00:08:30,625 --> 00:08:32,625
[crowd cheering]

134
00:08:34,667 --> 00:08:36,667
[choir singing a hymn]

135
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:38,542
Now you can accept the surrender.

136
00:08:38,625 --> 00:08:39,667
[Valence] Yes, Sire.

137
00:08:40,792 --> 00:08:43,833
Congratulations, my lords.
Today, you're on the winning side.

138
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:47,333
I'm proud of you, Robert.

139
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:49,750
You had the courage to stand up to me,

140
00:08:50,167 --> 00:08:51,792
and the wisdom to stand down.

141
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:54,792
Well done for bringing
your son round, Rob.

142
00:08:55,917 --> 00:08:58,083
[choir singing a hymn]

143
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:05,958
[crowd clamoring and laughing]

144
00:09:06,042 --> 00:09:09,417
Sir Roger de Mowbray,
fierce steward of the north,

145
00:09:09,792 --> 00:09:12,083
vanquisher of Stirling!
Our thanks!

146
00:09:12,167 --> 00:09:13,083
[crowd cheering]

147
00:09:13,167 --> 00:09:15,750
- Finally, Sir Richard de Burgh,
- [crowd cheering]

148
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,125
valiant marshal,
loyal servant of the Crown.

149
00:09:19,208 --> 00:09:20,408
[Richard de Burgh] Your Grace.

150
00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:23,125
We give the hand
of your daughter, Elizabeth,

151
00:09:23,208 --> 00:09:27,042
my god-daughter,
to Sir Robert de Brus.

152
00:09:27,125 --> 00:09:28,958
[crowd cheering and laughing]

153
00:09:34,292 --> 00:09:38,625
And may this pairing symbolize
the harmonious union of our two countries.

154
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:40,500
[crowd cheering and laughing]

155
00:09:43,292 --> 00:09:44,833
[Edward] The fathers may kiss.

156
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,458
You’ve mourned her long enough, Robert.

157
00:09:55,458 --> 00:09:57,583
Edward’s intentions were well-meant.

158
00:09:58,083 --> 00:10:00,750
The important thing is we are favored.

159
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:02,875
This council with Valence...

160
00:10:03,875 --> 00:10:05,500
is a mere formality.

161
00:10:06,667 --> 00:10:08,375
Edward will offer us the crown.

162
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:10,708
He all but promised me.

163
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:13,083
You’d be a lackey.

164
00:10:14,125 --> 00:10:15,125
Yes...

165
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:17,583
if it meant me being king.

166
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:20,375
And after me, you.

167
00:10:21,583 --> 00:10:22,583
King Robert.

168
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:48,083
[man] Sadly, the choice was to submit
or be hounded to death. It's that simple.

169
00:10:48,167 --> 00:10:50,847
- And you trust Edward's peace, Angus?
- I didn't say I trusted him.

170
00:10:50,917 --> 00:10:52,976
What is peace with a sword
to the throat? I say we fight...

171
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,125
We swore an oath, Alexander, to God.

172
00:10:55,208 --> 00:10:57,458
If we break it, we'll have no honor left.

173
00:10:57,542 --> 00:10:59,476
[Alexander] So we do nothing, Euan?
And live like cowards?

174
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,380
- That's not what I meant...
- [yelling] Enough!

175
00:11:05,375 --> 00:11:06,667
Father...

176
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:09,000
made the decision.

177
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:12,833
It is ours to bear.

178
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:27,083
[Richard de Burgh] His family has
vast lands north and south to the border.

179
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:28,625
You could do a lot worse.

180
00:11:29,667 --> 00:11:31,333
What happened to his first wife?

181
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:33,833
She died giving birth to his daughter.

182
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,792
Do I have to call her Mother?

183
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:41,250
No.

184
00:11:41,292 --> 00:11:43,292
I wonder if she’ll like Jessie.

185
00:11:43,792 --> 00:11:46,625
[Robert chuckles]
Well, she’d better!

186
00:11:47,667 --> 00:11:50,083
- [Robert groans]
- [trumpet blares in distance]

187
00:11:53,375 --> 00:11:54,375
Are you ready?

188
00:11:58,417 --> 00:12:00,101
I hear this one's got
two legs for a change.

189
00:12:00,125 --> 00:12:02,000
- Heard she smells like Jessie, too.
- Quiet!

190
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:03,083
Hairy old thing.

191
00:12:05,167 --> 00:12:06,887
- [Prince of Wales] Robert.
- Your Highness.

192
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:08,500
My father sends his best.

193
00:12:09,042 --> 00:12:11,167
And you know Bishop Lamberton, of course.

194
00:12:11,292 --> 00:12:13,000
- Bishop.
- Congratulations, Lord Bruce.

195
00:12:20,583 --> 00:12:21,583
My lord.

196
00:12:21,625 --> 00:12:24,083
[Richard de Burgh] My lord,
my daughter Elizabeth.

197
00:12:33,458 --> 00:12:34,458
My lady.

198
00:12:36,417 --> 00:12:37,417
My lord.

199
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:41,250
Welcome.

200
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,292
And you must be Marjorie?

201
00:12:47,708 --> 00:12:50,958
- [dog whines softly]
- And who’s this handsome fellow?

202
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:53,583
Our dog, Jessie, my lady.

203
00:12:54,167 --> 00:12:55,167
Call me Elizabeth.

204
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:56,583
- Elizabeth?
- Mm-hmm.

205
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,917
[choir singing hymn]

206
00:13:30,667 --> 00:13:33,833
[ceilidh band playing]

207
00:13:36,542 --> 00:13:39,333
My lord, your new estates in Ireland,

208
00:13:40,625 --> 00:13:42,667
from which you will now gather rents.

209
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:44,625
Most kind, my lord.

210
00:13:50,208 --> 00:13:53,208
- What do you think you're doing?
- Lord Bruce bid us celebrate in here.

211
00:13:53,417 --> 00:13:55,458
Get back in the kitchen.

212
00:13:57,292 --> 00:13:59,083
Are you enjoying yourself?

213
00:14:00,625 --> 00:14:01,625
Trying to.

214
00:14:04,625 --> 00:14:05,625
Are you?

215
00:14:06,375 --> 00:14:07,375
I'm...

216
00:14:09,167 --> 00:14:10,333
appreciating your honesty.

217
00:14:10,417 --> 00:14:11,500
[Elizabeth chuckles]

218
00:14:17,167 --> 00:14:18,167
My lord.

219
00:14:18,833 --> 00:14:21,000
It's about time
to retire to your bedchamber.

220
00:14:21,458 --> 00:14:22,583
Please, follow me.

221
00:14:28,667 --> 00:14:30,667
[crowd cheering]

222
00:14:30,917 --> 00:14:33,792
Yes, that's it, Bruce! Off to bed!

223
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:36,917
Time to rut! [laughing]

224
00:14:40,667 --> 00:14:47,375
[Lamberton reading prayer in Latin]

225
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:50,042
Amen.

226
00:14:50,167 --> 00:14:51,792
- [Robert]Amen.
- [Elizabeth] Amen.

227
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,250
Was this her room?

228
00:15:05,792 --> 00:15:06,792
Yes.

229
00:15:11,458 --> 00:15:13,625
Thank you for enduring
what you had to tonight.

230
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:15,167
I'm sure it was difficult.

231
00:15:22,458 --> 00:15:23,458
Sleep well.

232
00:15:30,042 --> 00:15:35,042
[door opens and closes]

233
00:15:36,833 --> 00:15:37,917
[exhales]

234
00:15:44,542 --> 00:15:46,667
[door closes]

235
00:15:52,708 --> 00:15:54,583
That was... quick.

236
00:15:56,042 --> 00:15:58,958
[sighs] Aye, well, you'd know
plenty about that, Seamus.

237
00:16:07,708 --> 00:16:10,750
[humming "Bonny at Morn"]

238
00:16:26,042 --> 00:16:27,292
[Robert] What song is that?

239
00:16:28,792 --> 00:16:29,875
"Bonny at Morn."

240
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,625
That's pretty.

241
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:34,875
Thank you.

242
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:50,083
[man] Taxes for wool!

243
00:16:50,167 --> 00:16:51,000
Taxes for honey!

244
00:16:51,083 --> 00:16:52,243
- This way, please.
- My lord,

245
00:16:52,292 --> 00:16:56,083
you promised our taxes would be reduced
once the wars with Edward were over.

246
00:16:56,292 --> 00:16:57,750
Aye, I know, Iain.

247
00:16:57,833 --> 00:17:01,375
Sadly, we're still paying Edward
compensation for the rebellion.

248
00:17:02,458 --> 00:17:03,917
Aye.

249
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:06,542
- How are you?
- My lady.

250
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:07,833
[Elizabeth chuckles]

251
00:17:09,667 --> 00:17:13,042
[man] Livestock over there,
by the horses. Everything else over here.

252
00:17:14,417 --> 00:17:16,000
All baskets over that side.

253
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:21,768
- [man] Get out the way!
- [man] In the name of the King!

254
00:17:21,792 --> 00:17:23,250
[hoofbeats]

255
00:17:24,167 --> 00:17:25,500
[man] Move aside there!

256
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:30,250
- [man] Move yourselves!
- I'll handle this, Father.

257
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:33,917
[man] Round them up! Yes! Come on!

258
00:17:34,042 --> 00:17:35,750
[panicked cries]

259
00:17:42,417 --> 00:17:46,875
It is our feudal duty to provide fighting
men for our overlord, King Edward.

260
00:17:46,958 --> 00:17:49,583
You assured us
these obligations would be over!

261
00:17:49,667 --> 00:17:51,708
- I'd hoped they were.
- [woman] He’s not yet 14!

262
00:17:51,792 --> 00:17:52,792
[woman] Bastards!

263
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,250
Stop!

264
00:17:56,333 --> 00:17:59,500
My father is Richard de Burgh,
a senior marshal in your army.

265
00:17:59,583 --> 00:18:01,125
I presume you have heard of him?

266
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:05,042
I know for a fact he prefers
to command men, not children.

267
00:18:06,583 --> 00:18:07,583
Let him go.

268
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:09,708
Let him go.

269
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:11,792
[man] Do it. We have enough.

270
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:31,875
[knock at door]

271
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,750
What you did today was...

272
00:18:50,417 --> 00:18:51,417
brave.

273
00:18:56,875 --> 00:18:57,917
Anything else?

274
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:01,750
No.

275
00:19:02,917 --> 00:19:04,042
Good night, then.

276
00:19:04,958 --> 00:19:05,958
Good...

277
00:19:15,375 --> 00:19:16,250
[scoffs]

278
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:19,417
- [Elizabeth laughing]
- [Marjorie laughing and squealing]

279
00:19:23,708 --> 00:19:25,208
[woman] Marjorie!

280
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,792
[man] I'll see Lord Valence
gets these conscription papers

281
00:19:33,875 --> 00:19:34,917
straight away, my lord.

282
00:19:35,042 --> 00:19:37,500
[coughing and wheezing]

283
00:19:41,583 --> 00:19:44,750
Did I ever tell you of the time,
Robert, when I...

284
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:47,750
went to the Holy Land to fight?

285
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:51,917
I bought a small monkey on a chain.

286
00:19:52,708 --> 00:19:55,667
- Moses, we christened him. [laughs]
- [Robert laughs]

287
00:19:56,250 --> 00:20:00,750
All the hours me and King Edward
spent training Moses...

288
00:20:02,167 --> 00:20:04,875
In the end, he could ride a horse.

289
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:09,875
He could even fire a tiny bow and arrow

290
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:13,500
that Edward himself had fashioned.
[laughs]

291
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Aye.

292
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:30,458
Edward...

293
00:20:32,667 --> 00:20:33,958
was my friend, Robert.

294
00:20:35,583 --> 00:20:37,417
He was my brother in arms.

295
00:20:38,625 --> 00:20:40,208
But I fear I've made a...

296
00:20:41,292 --> 00:20:43,000
a grave mistake in trusting him.

297
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:52,792
[exhales heavily]

298
00:21:02,958 --> 00:21:04,958
[exhales heavily]

299
00:21:06,375 --> 00:21:07,500
Father?

300
00:21:08,875 --> 00:21:09,917
Father?

301
00:21:14,958 --> 00:21:18,083
[choir singing mournful hymn]

302
00:21:38,917 --> 00:21:42,792
[singing mournful hymn]

303
00:21:51,833 --> 00:21:53,667
Robert, you just buried your father.

304
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,833
I’m still obliged
to pay my taxes to our king.

305
00:22:22,708 --> 00:22:23,917
Fresh pies!

306
00:22:25,125 --> 00:22:27,476
- Would you like a pie, sir?
- [Angus] What do you have, my dear?

307
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:29,000
[woman] We have game pie, sir.

308
00:22:29,375 --> 00:22:30,375
Bless you.

309
00:22:33,375 --> 00:22:34,542
Clear the way!

310
00:22:38,958 --> 00:22:40,250
[man in low voice] Bastards!

311
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:49,833
This yours, little fellow? Eh?
Did you lose something?

312
00:22:49,958 --> 00:22:51,958
[Angus laughs]

313
00:23:02,333 --> 00:23:04,373
- Taxes from Carrick.
- [man] Thank you, Lord Bruce.

314
00:23:15,083 --> 00:23:17,083
[crowd clamoring angrily]

315
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:26,250
[Alexander] What's happened?

316
00:23:28,458 --> 00:23:30,458
[man] Wallace! William Wallace!

317
00:23:31,125 --> 00:23:32,365
- [girl screams] No!
- Bastards!

318
00:23:33,292 --> 00:23:35,708
- Go home!
- [man] Soldiers! Form a line!

319
00:23:35,792 --> 00:23:38,583
- Disperse by order of the King!
- [woman] You murderers!

320
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:41,542
- [woman] You murdering bastards!
- [Angus] They've killed Wallace.

321
00:23:42,333 --> 00:23:43,583
[man] Get back!

322
00:23:44,292 --> 00:23:47,083
- [soldier yelling] Move back!
- [man] Bastards!

323
00:23:47,167 --> 00:23:48,487
Make way in the name of the King!

324
00:23:48,917 --> 00:23:49,792
Move!

325
00:23:49,875 --> 00:23:51,542
[soldier] Get back, you bastards!

326
00:23:51,625 --> 00:23:52,917
Move!

327
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,583
[panicked shouting]

328
00:23:55,167 --> 00:23:56,247
[soldier yelling] Get back!

329
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:58,500
[woman] You bastards!

330
00:23:59,542 --> 00:24:01,500
- [Angus] Get back, Robert!
- [man] Robert!

331
00:24:01,583 --> 00:24:04,333
- [soldier] Beat them back!
- [soldier] Disperse!

332
00:24:04,792 --> 00:24:05,792
Get back!

333
00:24:07,417 --> 00:24:08,417
Bastards!

334
00:24:09,667 --> 00:24:10,833
[man] You can't do this!

335
00:24:11,333 --> 00:24:12,500
This is for Wallace!

336
00:24:15,583 --> 00:24:17,083
[man] Kill the bastards!

337
00:24:18,042 --> 00:24:19,875
We have to do something here!

338
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:21,167
They're too strong.

339
00:24:21,542 --> 00:24:22,708
[man] There's too many!

340
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
[man] Wallace!

341
00:24:24,583 --> 00:24:28,167
[man] We have to do something!
Robert, we have to fight back!

342
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:30,083
[Angus] Now is not the time. Robert!

343
00:24:30,167 --> 00:24:33,333
- [man] Wallace!
- [man] Come on! Robert!

344
00:24:33,583 --> 00:24:34,667
[Angus] Let's go!

345
00:24:36,125 --> 00:24:37,792
- More wine, my lord?
- Thank you, Seamus.

346
00:24:37,875 --> 00:24:40,000
Elizabeth, I have to speak to my brothers.

347
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:43,393
That's fine.
I can hear what you have to say.

348
00:24:43,417 --> 00:24:44,417
Alone.

349
00:24:45,125 --> 00:24:46,708
Seamus, Gayle, Drew.

350
00:24:47,167 --> 00:24:48,375
[Seamus] My Lord.

351
00:24:53,458 --> 00:24:54,458
[sighs]

352
00:24:57,750 --> 00:24:58,792
Good night.

353
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:07,125
We swore vows on King Edward’s Bible...

354
00:25:10,292 --> 00:25:11,708
that we will need to break.

355
00:25:13,958 --> 00:25:16,042
- Why? What happened?
- Wallace is dead.

356
00:25:17,958 --> 00:25:19,583
The people are up in arms.

357
00:25:20,917 --> 00:25:22,125
There can be no peace.

358
00:25:25,833 --> 00:25:26,833
What would Father say?

359
00:25:26,917 --> 00:25:29,750
Father is gone. This is my decision.

360
00:25:31,333 --> 00:25:33,208
But you are my blood.

361
00:25:34,917 --> 00:25:35,917
My family.

362
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:39,333
I cannot do this without you.

363
00:25:42,417 --> 00:25:44,042
We need to raise an army.

364
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:47,708
It's crucial we get as many Lords
on our side as possible,

365
00:25:47,792 --> 00:25:49,292
including John Comyn.

366
00:25:53,583 --> 00:25:55,167
[door opens]

367
00:25:59,083 --> 00:26:02,125
[Robert] I'm sorry if I was rude earlier,
but I...

368
00:26:02,208 --> 00:26:03,833
I know you have no need for my counsel.

369
00:26:04,458 --> 00:26:06,833
It’s true, I have seen
very little of the world.

370
00:26:07,333 --> 00:26:11,792
However, a young lady of my standing
is afforded a great deal of time to read,

371
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:13,958
to form distinct opinions, and...

372
00:26:14,583 --> 00:26:17,250
to draw her own conclusions
about the nature of power.

373
00:26:18,958 --> 00:26:20,833
- All right.
- Power is making decisions.

374
00:26:21,542 --> 00:26:24,583
Power is not allowing yourself
to be buffeted on the tides of history.

375
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:28,333
Instead, it is choosing a boat,
climbing aboard, and hoisting the sail.

376
00:26:32,292 --> 00:26:33,583
I choose you.

377
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:37,208
And whatever course you are charting,

378
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:38,542
I choose you.

379
00:26:39,708 --> 00:26:40,833
My husband.

380
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:08,333
[exhales]

381
00:27:12,292 --> 00:27:13,292
Good night.

382
00:27:13,542 --> 00:27:14,542
Good night.

383
00:27:18,208 --> 00:27:19,458
[door opens]

384
00:27:22,792 --> 00:27:23,792
[door closes]

385
00:27:39,417 --> 00:27:40,833
I don't like it.

386
00:27:41,708 --> 00:27:43,042
We can't trust Comyn.

387
00:27:43,583 --> 00:27:45,375
[man] It's sacred ground, Angus.

388
00:27:45,833 --> 00:27:47,042
[Angus] I still don't like it.

389
00:27:47,167 --> 00:27:48,792
[man] Well, he insisted.

390
00:27:57,625 --> 00:28:00,208
I confess,
I was surprised to receive your letter.

391
00:28:01,167 --> 00:28:04,792
“I do urgently desire to discuss with you
a matter most delicate.”

392
00:28:05,542 --> 00:28:07,542
It's a bit cryptic, wouldn’t you say?

393
00:28:08,958 --> 00:28:10,375
It was intentional.

394
00:28:10,708 --> 00:28:11,708
I see.

395
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:16,792
And if I were to infer that your aim
was in fact to reignite a rebellion...

396
00:28:20,792 --> 00:28:22,083
We already tried it.

397
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:25,500
For eight bloody years.
And we failed.

398
00:28:25,667 --> 00:28:26,958
Because we didn’t unite.

399
00:28:27,125 --> 00:28:28,917
No, because your family

400
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,833
were too busy trying to claim
a crown that wasn’t theirs.

401
00:28:33,417 --> 00:28:35,417
Are you saying you wish
to relinquish that claim?

402
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:39,000
I’m saying we need to set aside
our rivalry and win back our country.

403
00:28:39,083 --> 00:28:41,875
Then we can decide
who wears the crown. <i>Us.</i>

404
00:28:42,542 --> 00:28:43,542
Not Edward.

405
00:28:45,667 --> 00:28:48,917
John, between us,
we could raise 20,000 men.

406
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:52,833
- We could have a fighting chance.
- It’ll never work.

407
00:28:53,417 --> 00:28:55,667
The people are tired of war and suffering.

408
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:58,625
Wallace was tortured and slaughtered.
The people aren't tired,

409
00:28:58,875 --> 00:29:00,500
they are desperate for justice.

410
00:29:00,583 --> 00:29:02,125
Wallace got what he deserved.

411
00:29:04,333 --> 00:29:06,333
He wasn’t a man, he was an idea.

412
00:29:06,708 --> 00:29:09,083
A destructive and dangerous idea.

413
00:29:09,167 --> 00:29:11,583
Almost as dangerous
as the idea you’re proposing.

414
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:13,333
You Bruces are all the same.

415
00:29:13,417 --> 00:29:15,583
- John...
- You’re not worthy of our country.

416
00:29:15,667 --> 00:29:19,125
And I swear I’ll do whatever it takes
to keep you from being its king.

417
00:29:20,417 --> 00:29:23,833
And once I explain to Edward
the meaning of your furtive letter to me,

418
00:29:24,917 --> 00:29:26,667
he’ll place a noose over your head...

419
00:29:28,833 --> 00:29:30,792
and Scotland’s crown upon mine.

420
00:29:33,208 --> 00:29:34,208
[Comyn grunts]

421
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,208
[Comyn choking]

422
00:29:41,167 --> 00:29:42,167
[choking]

423
00:29:46,292 --> 00:29:48,292
[Comyn panting]

424
00:30:06,958 --> 00:30:08,958
[wind whistles]

425
00:30:12,458 --> 00:30:15,458
[Angus] He was going to betray you.
You had no other choice, Robert.

426
00:30:15,542 --> 00:30:18,958
We have to tell Lamberton.
I'm a damned man now.

427
00:30:24,042 --> 00:30:26,708
[Lamberton] <i>With Robert,
at least we stand a chance.</i>

428
00:30:26,792 --> 00:30:29,875
[man] <i>He needs to be excommunicated,
as the Pope will surely demand.</i>

429
00:30:29,958 --> 00:30:31,583
[Lamberton] Where would that leave us?

430
00:30:31,667 --> 00:30:34,958
If we disown him now,
we remain at the mercy of Edward.

431
00:30:35,042 --> 00:30:38,375
The survival
of the Scottish church is at stake.

432
00:30:38,458 --> 00:30:42,000
No one is arguing that,
but you are asking us

433
00:30:42,375 --> 00:30:43,708
to support a murderer.

434
00:30:43,792 --> 00:30:46,083
The answer is clear, is it not?

435
00:30:53,125 --> 00:30:54,833
[approaching footsteps]

436
00:31:04,667 --> 00:31:06,083
[bishop] You will confess.

437
00:31:06,458 --> 00:31:09,625
And I will absolve you
for the murder of John Comyn.

438
00:31:10,208 --> 00:31:12,833
If you vow to support the Church,

439
00:31:12,917 --> 00:31:15,708
we will support
your inauguration as our king.

440
00:31:26,042 --> 00:31:28,167
It must be done quickly. In Scone.

441
00:31:28,625 --> 00:31:29,542
Scone may be dangerous.

442
00:31:29,625 --> 00:31:31,458
It’s next to the English garrison
at Perth.

443
00:31:31,542 --> 00:31:35,125
For the people, it must be Scone.
We need legitimacy,

444
00:31:35,542 --> 00:31:37,042
particularly now.

445
00:31:39,375 --> 00:31:40,375
Scone it is.

446
00:31:51,708 --> 00:31:54,000
[yelling] I am so sick of Scotland!

447
00:31:54,083 --> 00:31:55,083
[door closes]

448
00:31:55,167 --> 00:31:58,875
Slaying his rival on sacred ground.
It’s lunacy!

449
00:31:58,958 --> 00:32:01,667
I knew he detested John Comyn,
but I never thought he'd go this far.

450
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:05,125
He'll have himself crowned king
before the Pope can excommunicate him.

451
00:32:05,208 --> 00:32:08,167
King? Robert? You think he would dare?

452
00:32:08,917 --> 00:32:09,917
Yes.

453
00:32:10,958 --> 00:32:12,638
[Prince of Wales]
Put me in charge of this.

454
00:32:14,667 --> 00:32:17,125
I know you think me incompetent, Father,

455
00:32:17,625 --> 00:32:19,375
- but I am to be king...
- [Edward] Hm.

456
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:21,750
...one day. Let this be a test.

457
00:32:21,833 --> 00:32:23,208
What would you do, son?

458
00:32:26,333 --> 00:32:28,750
I would raise the dragon, Father.

459
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:38,958
Get word to Valence.

460
00:32:39,042 --> 00:32:41,292
Robert the Bruce to be declared an outlaw.

461
00:32:42,542 --> 00:32:46,625
Any man or woman who would give shelter
to him or any of his ranks

462
00:32:46,708 --> 00:32:48,792
to be executed without trial.

463
00:32:48,958 --> 00:32:52,208
My son will raise the dragon banner.

464
00:32:52,958 --> 00:32:56,833
The codes of chivalry are ended.
There will be no quarter.

465
00:32:58,042 --> 00:33:00,167
Your recklessness
is going to get us all killed!

466
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:03,792
- Not if we stand side by side.
- The bishops absolved him.

467
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,417
- Surely you can do the same.
- It’s not as simple as that.

468
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:09,917
- Why is it not as simple as that?
- Because we promised our people peace!

469
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:11,875
[lord] We should never have surrendered.

470
00:33:11,958 --> 00:33:14,667
We had no choice because we had
no one to lead us.

471
00:33:15,792 --> 00:33:16,833
Perhaps now we do.

472
00:33:19,208 --> 00:33:21,792
The Comyns
and the Balliols will never swallow that.

473
00:33:21,875 --> 00:33:23,125
[mocking laughter]

474
00:33:23,208 --> 00:33:24,792
The Balliols have had their chance.

475
00:33:24,875 --> 00:33:27,275
- Think about what you're doing here.
- It's time for change.

476
00:33:27,333 --> 00:33:28,583
Malcolm.

477
00:33:29,875 --> 00:33:31,458
[lord] He will not be forgiven.

478
00:33:34,167 --> 00:33:37,208
Robert... I'm with you.

479
00:33:37,917 --> 00:33:38,917
[lord] As am I.

480
00:33:40,625 --> 00:33:42,125
[man] Hurry yourself. Come on!

481
00:33:46,917 --> 00:33:48,125
[Elizabeth sighs]

482
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
We must be careful on the road to Scone.

483
00:33:54,625 --> 00:33:56,625
We have enemies on all sides now.

484
00:34:00,083 --> 00:34:01,083
I am sorry...

485
00:34:02,875 --> 00:34:04,792
for bringing you into this.

486
00:34:07,042 --> 00:34:08,042
I understand.

487
00:34:09,708 --> 00:34:10,833
And I know my duty.

488
00:34:15,458 --> 00:34:16,458
Hm.

489
00:34:19,542 --> 00:34:20,542
Thank you.

490
00:34:22,375 --> 00:34:24,125
I'll be with you the whole time.

491
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:29,292
[Marjorie] Can we?

492
00:34:30,292 --> 00:34:33,458
- Please, can we take him?
- We can't. I'm sorry.

493
00:34:33,833 --> 00:34:35,684
- Seamus here will take good care of him.
- Please.

494
00:34:35,708 --> 00:34:36,708
Let's move out.

495
00:34:48,292 --> 00:34:50,542
[man] Halt! Rider ahead.

496
00:35:10,083 --> 00:35:11,208
Just be ready.

497
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,542
What is your business?

498
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Halt.

499
00:35:19,208 --> 00:35:20,542
I said halt!

500
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:25,750
[James] My Lord,

501
00:35:26,458 --> 00:35:29,417
I am James, son of William Douglas
of Douglasdale.

502
00:35:32,083 --> 00:35:33,667
I recognize your father in you.

503
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,083
I've come to pledge myself
to you as your defender.

504
00:35:37,417 --> 00:35:38,792
He could be a spy,

505
00:35:38,875 --> 00:35:41,917
loyal to Comyn, perhaps,
or even Edward.

506
00:35:42,542 --> 00:35:44,000
What is it you actually want?

507
00:35:44,083 --> 00:35:46,792
I want what Edward stole
from my father and me.

508
00:35:47,625 --> 00:35:48,917
I want my land back.

509
00:35:51,833 --> 00:35:53,333
I want my name back.

510
00:35:55,250 --> 00:35:56,708
Now, you give me that,

511
00:35:57,833 --> 00:35:59,750
I will be loyal to you forever.

512
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:03,500
I killed John Comyn at the altar.

513
00:36:06,458 --> 00:36:09,083
You should know the man
to whom you’re offering loyalty.

514
00:36:18,042 --> 00:36:19,250
Are you a good man?

515
00:36:22,958 --> 00:36:24,083
I’m trying to be.

516
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:28,125
That’s good enough for me.

517
00:36:29,583 --> 00:36:31,708
[Angus] Oh, aren’t we fortunate.

518
00:36:32,375 --> 00:36:33,792
You can bring up the rear.

519
00:37:32,125 --> 00:37:34,833
Let this blow be
the last you receive unanswered.

520
00:37:36,833 --> 00:37:37,833
Next.

521
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:47,583
[bishop] The crown worn
by every Scottish king

522
00:37:47,667 --> 00:37:49,958
has been stolen by the English King.

523
00:37:50,042 --> 00:37:52,708
So, too, our ancient coronation stone

524
00:37:52,875 --> 00:37:58,083
and yet remains in Scotland a little gold
and good men to work it.

525
00:38:02,458 --> 00:38:03,917
We have a crown.

526
00:38:04,833 --> 00:38:08,458
We have a king to wear it.
Praise be to God.

527
00:38:16,958 --> 00:38:18,167
I inaugurate you,

528
00:38:18,958 --> 00:38:23,625
Robert Bruce, son of Robert Bruce,
son of Robert Bruce,

529
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,667
son of Isabella Huntingdon,
daughter of David, Earl of Huntingdon,

530
00:38:29,167 --> 00:38:31,292
son of Henry, Earl of Huntingdon,

531
00:38:32,292 --> 00:38:35,083
son of David, King of Scots.

532
00:38:40,375 --> 00:38:43,083
God bless the King of Scots.

533
00:38:43,833 --> 00:38:46,208
[crowd] God bless the King of Scots.

534
00:38:49,333 --> 00:38:50,583
Your Majesty.

535
00:38:51,125 --> 00:38:53,708
[choir singing hymn]

536
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:03,208
[bishop reciting blessing in Latin]

537
00:39:11,083 --> 00:39:12,542
I wear this crown

538
00:39:14,125 --> 00:39:17,125
as a symbol of my duty
to serve the Scottish people.

539
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:20,042
My title is King of Scots.

540
00:39:22,583 --> 00:39:26,500
Not of the land, but of the people.

541
00:39:31,708 --> 00:39:34,000
[shouting] By these swans,

542
00:39:34,250 --> 00:39:39,667
I vow to avenge
this murderous insult to God!

543
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:41,833
[crowd cheering]

544
00:39:56,875 --> 00:39:59,167
I hereby pledge my undying fealty

545
00:39:59,875 --> 00:40:02,000
to Robert Bruce, King of Scots.

546
00:40:02,208 --> 00:40:03,208
Thank you, my lord.

547
00:40:06,583 --> 00:40:07,917
[Robert chuckles]

548
00:40:08,792 --> 00:40:11,375
Scrymgeour, you have hands like rocks.

549
00:40:11,667 --> 00:40:14,833
These are paws. My father was a bear.

550
00:40:14,917 --> 00:40:16,042
[laughs]

551
00:40:17,250 --> 00:40:19,958
I, too, pledge my undying fealty.

552
00:40:20,083 --> 00:40:22,417
Valence's men are assembling in Perth.

553
00:40:24,833 --> 00:40:26,500
And now the real test begins.

554
00:40:26,667 --> 00:40:27,667
Aye...

555
00:40:28,667 --> 00:40:29,792
Your Majesty.

556
00:40:37,750 --> 00:40:39,125
You were wise to join us.

557
00:40:39,792 --> 00:40:41,792
That murderer is no king of mine.

558
00:40:41,958 --> 00:40:45,583
Nor anyone’s much longer.
The Prince and his envoy are on their way,

559
00:40:45,708 --> 00:40:47,708
unbound by the shackles of chivalry.

560
00:40:48,583 --> 00:40:50,375
They’re flying the dragon banner.

561
00:40:51,292 --> 00:40:52,708
[panicked shouting]

562
00:41:19,542 --> 00:41:22,083
As King of Scots,
I speak for our sovereign nation.

563
00:41:24,458 --> 00:41:26,792
I demand that you return
our castle at Perth.

564
00:41:28,542 --> 00:41:30,250
I demand that you return to your homeland.

565
00:41:30,875 --> 00:41:32,333
“King of Scots.”

566
00:41:36,250 --> 00:41:37,875
You murdered my brother-in-law

567
00:41:37,958 --> 00:41:39,917
and made my sister a widow.

568
00:41:41,292 --> 00:41:43,042
I look forward to this fight.

569
00:41:45,375 --> 00:41:47,958
We can resolve this conflict
by fighting one-on-one.

570
00:41:48,417 --> 00:41:49,417
Now.

571
00:41:52,458 --> 00:41:53,625
I accept.

572
00:41:56,125 --> 00:41:58,208
But today is a Sunday.

573
00:41:59,292 --> 00:42:02,000
I know you don’t much respect
holy matters, but I do.

574
00:42:04,083 --> 00:42:05,083
Tomorrow then.

575
00:42:10,542 --> 00:42:11,542
Tomorrow then.

576
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,458
That wasn't the plan, Robert.

577
00:42:26,458 --> 00:42:29,667
The man's a bloody beast.
Are you sure this is a good idea?

578
00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:30,875
I can handle myself.

579
00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:33,125
And what happens if he kills you?

580
00:42:36,333 --> 00:42:38,000
Shouldn’t you wait for the Prince?

581
00:42:38,375 --> 00:42:41,500
The Prince has served his purpose
by raising the dragon banner.

582
00:42:41,833 --> 00:42:43,583
Are you sure that's a good idea?

583
00:42:44,042 --> 00:42:47,042
The King has made it clear
that we must do whatever it takes.

584
00:42:47,417 --> 00:42:50,333
We are dealing with outlaws, man.
They have no rights.

585
00:43:04,083 --> 00:43:07,250
[flute playing]

586
00:43:07,833 --> 00:43:09,333
- [man laughs]
- [man groans]

587
00:43:09,917 --> 00:43:12,198
[Robert] Trying to take
everyone's money again, Archibald?

588
00:43:12,708 --> 00:43:14,708
You fancy a game of knucklebone, Sire?

589
00:43:14,833 --> 00:43:16,833
[Robert]
Perhaps later. Go easy on them.

590
00:43:20,958 --> 00:43:23,292
- [man] You arsehole.
- [men laugh]

591
00:43:32,583 --> 00:43:33,833
Did you get them, Drew?

592
00:43:34,417 --> 00:43:35,417
Yes, Sire.

593
00:43:36,042 --> 00:43:37,042
Good man.

594
00:43:41,375 --> 00:43:43,583
I couldn't find any decent goblets.

595
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:55,250
- Nor any decent wine.
- No. [laughs]

596
00:43:55,417 --> 00:43:57,417
[Elizabeth laughs]

597
00:44:00,250 --> 00:44:01,542
[Robert sighs]

598
00:44:02,875 --> 00:44:05,167
Alas, we are but King
and Queen of the May.

599
00:44:08,917 --> 00:44:11,583
And tomorrow will come
to strip us of our crowns.

600
00:44:16,167 --> 00:44:17,167
No.

601
00:44:19,208 --> 00:44:21,833
We have too much work to do
to let that happen now.

602
00:44:24,917 --> 00:44:25,917
"We"?

603
00:44:34,292 --> 00:44:35,292
We.

604
00:45:44,375 --> 00:45:45,792
[Elizabeth gasps]

605
00:45:45,875 --> 00:45:47,042
[both laugh]

606
00:46:04,875 --> 00:46:06,042
[Elizabeth laughs]

607
00:46:19,083 --> 00:46:20,458
[Robert sighs heavily]

608
00:46:23,458 --> 00:46:24,708
[both breathing heavily]

609
00:46:36,792 --> 00:46:38,792
[Elizabeth moans and breathes heavily]

610
00:46:52,792 --> 00:46:56,417
[Elizabeth sings lullaby]

- [whispering] If I die tomorrow...
- No. I won’t speak of it...

619
00:47:40,750 --> 00:47:42,750
If I die tomorrow...

620
00:47:44,250 --> 00:47:46,542
you are Marjorie’s and she is yours.

621
00:47:49,583 --> 00:47:50,958
Do whatever you must.

622
00:47:51,875 --> 00:47:53,083
Do you understand?

623
00:47:58,667 --> 00:47:59,792
[wood splintering outside]

624
00:48:01,458 --> 00:48:03,750
What is it? Robert?

625
00:48:08,750 --> 00:48:12,042
[Angus screams] Ambush!

626
00:48:12,125 --> 00:48:13,292
[man] Get down!

627
00:48:15,875 --> 00:48:18,375
- Now, come!
- [Elizabeth] Marjorie, up.

628
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:20,583
- [Marjorie] What's happening?
- Up. Go.

629
00:48:21,167 --> 00:48:23,667
- Go! Get down!
- [Marjorie screaming]

630
00:48:25,417 --> 00:48:27,750
- [Elizabeth] Marjorie, hold on.
- [Robert] Down!

631
00:48:28,250 --> 00:48:30,625
[screaming and clamoring]

632
00:48:31,625 --> 00:48:34,667
- [Robert] Neil! Now, go!
- [Neil] I'm with you, Robert.

633
00:48:34,750 --> 00:48:36,792
Take them to the horses, go!

634
00:48:37,250 --> 00:48:38,542
Loose!

635
00:48:42,417 --> 00:48:44,208
[screaming and clamoring]

636
00:48:48,375 --> 00:48:51,125
[Elizabeth] Marjorie, run!
Come on, I need you to run!

637
00:48:51,542 --> 00:48:53,625
[Neil] Horses! Prepare the horses!

638
00:48:53,917 --> 00:48:55,375
Foot soldiers.

639
00:48:56,167 --> 00:48:58,167
[foot soldiers screaming and clamoring]

640
00:49:00,458 --> 00:49:02,250
Atholl men, on me!

641
00:49:02,333 --> 00:49:04,167
[Atholl clansman] Come on, you bastards!

642
00:49:11,542 --> 00:49:13,667
Take them to Kildrummy.
Lord Fraser's a friend.

643
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
Don’t worry, brother.
They’ll be safe with me.

644
00:49:16,083 --> 00:49:18,750
- [Neil] Come on.
- Lord Fraser will take you to France.

645
00:49:23,750 --> 00:49:26,333
I want you to take me. No.

646
00:49:26,417 --> 00:49:27,768
[Robert] I'll meet you there, okay?

647
00:49:27,792 --> 00:49:29,917
- You take us. Daddy, please.
- Be brave. I love you.

648
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,143
- Come on, Marjorie, let's go.
- [Robert] Look after each other.

649
00:49:32,167 --> 00:49:33,726
- [Marjorie] No! You can come!
- [Elizabeth] Marjorie.

650
00:49:33,750 --> 00:49:36,458
- [Neil] Come. Quickly.
- [Robert] I'll come find you.

651
00:49:36,542 --> 00:49:38,083
[Marjorie whimpering] Daddy!

652
00:49:39,250 --> 00:49:41,000
Charge!

653
00:49:58,583 --> 00:50:00,292
[soldier] Bruce! Ahhh!

654
00:50:16,458 --> 00:50:18,792
[James] Remember the name Douglas!

655
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:27,208
[James screams] Douglas!

656
00:50:32,250 --> 00:50:33,792
Douglas!

657
00:50:42,917 --> 00:50:44,208
[James] Douglas!

658
00:50:46,542 --> 00:50:48,875
Retreat! Pull back!

659
00:50:50,250 --> 00:50:51,250
John!

660
00:50:54,333 --> 00:50:56,167
Go! Go!

661
00:50:59,375 --> 00:51:03,042
- [Angus] Move! Get him out of here!
- [man] Go! Run!

662
00:51:17,917 --> 00:51:19,208
[Valence] Bruce isn't here!

663
00:51:19,958 --> 00:51:21,417
Kill all the prisoners.

664
00:51:22,167 --> 00:51:25,750
Let the Scots see what comes of pledging
fealty to their new "king."

665
00:51:26,958 --> 00:51:30,583
- [soldier] On your knees!
- [man] What about Atholl? He is an earl.

666
00:51:33,458 --> 00:51:34,792
[Valence] Take him to London.

667
00:51:34,875 --> 00:51:36,458
[Atholl] You bastard, Valence.

668
00:51:36,583 --> 00:51:39,000
[Valence]
The king will hang him for treason.

669
00:51:39,833 --> 00:51:42,583
And, Percy, spread word.

670
00:51:43,083 --> 00:51:45,792
Gold to those who lead us
to Robert the Bruce.

671
00:52:21,542 --> 00:52:22,875
[Marjorie crying]

672
00:52:36,458 --> 00:52:38,708
Perhaps you should say
a few words to the men.

673
00:52:38,958 --> 00:52:40,167
And say what?

674
00:52:42,125 --> 00:52:43,708
Let's get these men on the horses.

675
00:52:44,083 --> 00:52:46,208
[Angus] John, you're hurt.
Here, Duncan. Come here.

676
00:52:48,208 --> 00:52:50,208
[John groans in pain]

677
00:52:52,417 --> 00:52:53,417
Thank you.

678
00:52:56,750 --> 00:52:59,708
We can go to Islay, to my home.

679
00:53:00,667 --> 00:53:03,375
It’s so remote, no one will think
to look for you there.

680
00:53:03,875 --> 00:53:07,000
We can enlist the islanders.
Replenish our ranks.

681
00:53:11,042 --> 00:53:12,042
Robert?

682
00:53:13,417 --> 00:53:14,417
What do you think?

683
00:53:14,583 --> 00:53:16,083
We don't have a choice, do we?

684
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:23,250
Fifty men to fight
the strongest army in the world.

685
00:53:26,042 --> 00:53:27,042
[Alexander] Robert!

686
00:53:37,625 --> 00:53:38,833
[Robert] Lord MacDougall.

687
00:53:43,667 --> 00:53:45,083
Have you come to join us?

688
00:53:45,542 --> 00:53:47,667
And why would we be wanting to do that?

689
00:53:52,125 --> 00:53:54,250
No more taxes for Edward's pocket.

690
00:53:55,792 --> 00:53:58,667
No more good men
dying in wars not of their making.

691
00:54:01,042 --> 00:54:02,250
We can unite Scotland.

692
00:54:03,625 --> 00:54:04,917
We could win her back.

693
00:54:07,417 --> 00:54:10,292
You’ve got nerve, Bruce,
I’ll give you that.

694
00:54:16,458 --> 00:54:17,833
Comyn was my cousin.

695
00:54:19,417 --> 00:54:21,042
You’re no king of ours.

696
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,000
[grunts]

697
00:55:45,750 --> 00:55:48,708
[Neil] Lord Fraser, we bring the Queen.

698
00:55:49,792 --> 00:55:51,208
[Lord Fraser] Your Majesty.

699
00:55:52,625 --> 00:55:53,625
Follow me.

700
00:55:56,542 --> 00:55:57,833
Welcome to Kildrummy.

701
00:55:59,542 --> 00:56:02,250
You know, Marjorie,
your mother grew up here.

702
00:56:02,542 --> 00:56:05,375
- You can have her bedroom. [chuckles]
- [Marjorie giggles]

703
00:56:07,917 --> 00:56:09,000
[man] My lady.

704
00:56:19,792 --> 00:56:22,833
- [soldier] Hang the bastards!
- [villagers screaming and clamoring]

705
00:56:24,917 --> 00:56:27,717
[Prince of Wales] This is what you get
for supporting Robert the Bruce!

706
00:56:39,583 --> 00:56:42,500
We go south,
we run into Valence's men.

707
00:56:43,375 --> 00:56:45,833
And north,
we go back into MacDougall land.

708
00:56:46,417 --> 00:56:48,042
If we take the boats across this loch,

709
00:56:48,458 --> 00:56:51,208
the other side of that hill
is the coast to Islay.

710
00:56:51,792 --> 00:56:54,167
Ah, it's a wonderful idea
in theory, Douglas,

711
00:56:54,250 --> 00:56:55,708
but there's more hole than boat.

712
00:56:56,583 --> 00:56:58,000
This boat's good.

713
00:56:58,083 --> 00:56:59,125
We can't leave the horses.

714
00:56:59,208 --> 00:57:00,792
We don't need horses, we need men.

715
00:57:01,083 --> 00:57:02,833
Euan, gather provisions as you can.

716
00:57:02,917 --> 00:57:06,125
James, put the horses in the forest.
Alexander, you come with me.

717
00:57:06,208 --> 00:57:08,333
We need as many men
on that boat as we can.

718
00:57:08,417 --> 00:57:11,208
- Hamish, John.
- [James] Horses in the forest now!

719
00:57:11,417 --> 00:57:12,458
[Robert] Let's go.

720
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:14,125
We’ll be back for you.

721
00:57:14,208 --> 00:57:16,458
[James] Lead the horses
and follow me into the woods.

722
00:57:30,250 --> 00:57:32,250
[Robert] Good man, Alex. See you soon.

723
00:57:35,500 --> 00:57:38,042
[man] Not worth it, Your Majesty.
It's too small.

724
00:58:00,583 --> 00:58:02,042
[Robert shouts] Angus!

725
00:58:02,125 --> 00:58:04,417
Look! MacDougalls!

726
00:58:08,833 --> 00:58:10,250
[indistinct yelling]

727
00:58:11,500 --> 00:58:12,708
[Euan] MacDougall!

728
00:58:12,792 --> 00:58:14,592
- [James] Into the boats!
- [Euan] MacDougall!

729
00:58:16,958 --> 00:58:18,500
[James] MacDougall!

730
00:58:19,833 --> 00:58:21,250
Bruce's men!

731
00:58:21,333 --> 00:58:23,083
Hold the line!

732
00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:32,542
[MacDougall soldier]
Die, you Bruce bastard!

733
00:58:53,542 --> 00:58:55,042
- [man] To the boat!
- Quickly!

734
00:58:58,958 --> 00:59:00,083
[man] Go! Into the boat!

735
00:59:08,375 --> 00:59:09,375
Get on the boat!

736
00:59:09,708 --> 00:59:10,708
[Alexander] Take my hand.

737
00:59:10,750 --> 00:59:12,167
Come here. I've got you.

738
00:59:13,542 --> 00:59:14,542
[Euan] Thanks, brother.

739
00:59:18,542 --> 00:59:19,375
Alex?

740
00:59:19,458 --> 00:59:22,500
[Angus screams] No! No!

741
00:59:22,583 --> 00:59:23,875
Alex!

742
00:59:25,542 --> 00:59:26,542
No!

743
00:59:27,042 --> 00:59:28,167
No!

744
00:59:31,750 --> 00:59:35,750
[Angus] Euan, we need the space, boy!
We need the space!

745
00:59:35,917 --> 00:59:37,292
[Euan screams indistinctly]

746
00:59:42,667 --> 00:59:43,958
[Angus] I'm sorry, boy.

747
00:59:47,958 --> 00:59:49,458
[man] Come on board!

748
00:59:50,167 --> 00:59:52,458
Douglas! Come here!

749
00:59:53,750 --> 00:59:54,750
Get on!

750
00:59:54,875 --> 00:59:57,208
- Row!
- Row!

751
01:00:08,417 --> 01:00:09,500
[man] Come on! Row!

752
01:00:29,042 --> 01:00:30,083
Valence.

753
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:36,417
You failed to wait for me.

754
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:38,500
You attacked by night,
you had the upper hand,

755
01:00:38,583 --> 01:00:40,958
you had the element of surprise,
and yet you lost him.

756
01:00:41,042 --> 01:00:42,625
The battle was a success.

757
01:00:42,708 --> 01:00:44,417
We crushed them mercilessly.

758
01:00:44,583 --> 01:00:45,875
A few managed to escape.

759
01:00:46,042 --> 01:00:47,250
Including the Bruce!

760
01:00:47,583 --> 01:00:49,333
Your aim, <i>our </i>aim,

761
01:00:50,125 --> 01:00:51,792
was to capture him, and you failed!

762
01:00:51,875 --> 01:00:54,708
My scouts are searching for him,
Your Highness.

763
01:00:55,333 --> 01:00:56,667
And a reward has been offered.

764
01:00:56,750 --> 01:00:58,333
It will be <i>your </i>head if he's not found.

765
01:01:02,375 --> 01:01:04,542
- [Prince of Wales] Lord Buchan.
- Your Highness.

766
01:01:04,625 --> 01:01:05,750
You bring news of the Bruce?

767
01:01:06,250 --> 01:01:08,917
No, Your Highness,
his wife and child.

768
01:01:11,208 --> 01:01:14,292
Marjorie, we've been riding
horses for days. Are you not tired yet?

769
01:01:14,375 --> 01:01:15,958
- [women laugh]
- No.

770
01:01:16,333 --> 01:01:17,250
[door opens abruptly]

771
01:01:17,333 --> 01:01:19,458
English soldiers approaching,
we have to go now.

772
01:01:26,583 --> 01:01:28,958
Get to the trees,
I'll send horses and men. Go.

773
01:01:39,917 --> 01:01:41,167
Lord Fraser!

774
01:01:42,083 --> 01:01:44,792
We know you have
the Bruce’s wife and child.

775
01:01:44,875 --> 01:01:47,208
Hand them over and I spare the castle!

776
01:01:47,292 --> 01:01:49,042
[commander of archers] Draw!

777
01:01:52,583 --> 01:01:55,458
They are not here, Your Royal Highness.

778
01:01:56,708 --> 01:01:57,868
[commander of archers] Loose!

779
01:02:00,875 --> 01:02:02,208
[screaming]

780
01:02:02,542 --> 01:02:04,792
[Lord Fraser]
There’s no need to burn us down.

781
01:02:05,167 --> 01:02:07,208
I will open the gate.

782
01:02:14,208 --> 01:02:16,333
[Prince of Wales] Neil, where's Robert?

783
01:02:17,833 --> 01:02:19,625
[Neil] Your Highness, I don’t know.

784
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:21,750
Where are his wife and daughter?

785
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:23,750
They left for Turnberry on Tuesday.

786
01:02:24,542 --> 01:02:26,792
They left for Turnberry on Tuesday?

787
01:02:27,708 --> 01:02:29,750
- [Marjorie] Ow!
- [Elizabeth whimpering]

788
01:02:31,417 --> 01:02:32,708
[Marjorie] Elizabeth!

789
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:35,750
Where is your brother?

790
01:02:36,667 --> 01:02:37,917
I swear I don't know.

791
01:02:45,667 --> 01:02:47,500
I swear I don't know!

792
01:02:47,583 --> 01:02:49,708
- [Marjorie] Uncle Neil!
- I swear!

793
01:02:49,792 --> 01:02:51,792
- You forced my hand, Neil.
- [Marjorie] Elizabeth!

794
01:02:53,667 --> 01:02:55,347
- [Neil] I swear!
- [Elizabeth] Let him go!

795
01:02:55,417 --> 01:02:57,937
- [Neil] I swear I don't know!
- [Marjorie] What are they doing?

796
01:02:58,542 --> 01:03:00,542
- No, please. I swear.
- [Marjorie] Uncle Neil!

797
01:03:00,625 --> 01:03:02,167
[Elizabeth sobbing] No! No!

798
01:03:02,500 --> 01:03:04,500
[Marjorie crying]

799
01:03:05,833 --> 01:03:07,125
[choking]

800
01:03:10,083 --> 01:03:11,208
[Elizabeth] Look at me!

801
01:03:13,167 --> 01:03:15,167
[Elizabeth] No, no! No!

802
01:03:17,500 --> 01:03:19,500
[Marjorie crying and screaming]

803
01:03:20,208 --> 01:03:22,500
No! Stop!

804
01:03:22,833 --> 01:03:23,833
No, Neil!

805
01:03:28,583 --> 01:03:29,958
Where is your husband?

806
01:03:30,458 --> 01:03:31,542
[whimpering] We don’t know.

807
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:33,042
We don’t know.

808
01:03:34,167 --> 01:03:37,458
Please, have mercy.
Your father is a tyrant, you are not.

809
01:03:37,625 --> 01:03:38,917
You think me weak?

810
01:03:39,500 --> 01:03:41,083
Compassion is not weakness.

811
01:03:43,750 --> 01:03:46,375
I have all the traits my father has,
save one:

812
01:03:47,333 --> 01:03:48,333
mercy.

813
01:03:51,500 --> 01:03:52,500
Fraser.

814
01:03:54,458 --> 01:03:55,667
You seem like a...

815
01:03:59,292 --> 01:04:00,875
reasonable man.

816
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:05,375
Where's the Bruce?

817
01:04:08,625 --> 01:04:11,542
I truly don’t know.

818
01:04:17,167 --> 01:04:18,083
[blade slicing]

819
01:04:18,167 --> 01:04:19,833
[Marjorie screams and cries]

820
01:04:27,667 --> 01:04:28,708
Hang them both up

821
01:04:28,792 --> 01:04:32,708
for all to see what becomes of those
who support the outlaw Bruce.

822
01:04:33,208 --> 01:04:36,750
Take the women to England,
seize all his lands.

823
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:38,458
Leave him with nothing.

824
01:04:42,625 --> 01:04:44,333
[woman screams]

825
01:04:44,417 --> 01:04:46,417
[screaming and clamoring]

826
01:04:52,917 --> 01:04:55,042
[indistinct chatter]

827
01:04:55,125 --> 01:04:57,042
See you later. [chuckles]

828
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:26,000
[soldier] Come on.

829
01:05:26,458 --> 01:05:27,583
[Marjorie whimpers]

830
01:06:02,792 --> 01:06:04,167
[Robert] Lord Mackinnon.

831
01:06:04,792 --> 01:06:06,542
I heard a rumor you made yourself king,

832
01:06:07,083 --> 01:06:10,250
and the Prince is tearing Scotland
apart looking for you.

833
01:06:10,417 --> 01:06:12,167
I've come to ask for your support.

834
01:06:12,500 --> 01:06:15,375
[Lord Mackinnon] My men and I
stood with Wallace at Falkirk.

835
01:06:16,500 --> 01:06:17,958
Where were you then?

836
01:06:18,042 --> 01:06:20,122
[Robert] There was no winning Falkirk.
You know that.

837
01:06:20,458 --> 01:06:23,083
How can I follow a man
who's never won an open battle?

838
01:06:23,625 --> 01:06:27,375
From what I've been told,
you barely escaped Methven alive.

839
01:06:27,583 --> 01:06:29,103
We were ambushed in the dead of night.

840
01:06:30,625 --> 01:06:31,625
How many men have you?

841
01:06:33,208 --> 01:06:34,208
Forty.

842
01:06:35,667 --> 01:06:37,292
I'm still rounding people up.

843
01:06:40,583 --> 01:06:43,500
I wish you luck. I truly do.

844
01:06:43,833 --> 01:06:47,292
Come on, Lachlan!
I've known you for over 25 years.

845
01:06:47,375 --> 01:06:49,917
- Now just please, give us some people...
- Angus!

846
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,500
- [Euan] We've come here for your help.
- Are you done?

847
01:06:58,708 --> 01:07:00,917
I believe, in time,
you'll change your mind.

848
01:07:02,333 --> 01:07:03,333
And I'll be waiting.

849
01:07:05,417 --> 01:07:06,458
Move.

850
01:07:27,167 --> 01:07:30,583
[Angus] Good to see you all again!
Hamish, how you doing?

851
01:07:30,917 --> 01:07:31,917
How you doing, boy?

852
01:07:34,667 --> 01:07:35,708
My darling! [grunts]

853
01:07:35,833 --> 01:07:37,333
Where the fuck have you been?

854
01:07:38,458 --> 01:07:40,625
You said three weeks,
it’s been four months!

855
01:07:41,125 --> 01:07:42,750
Much has happened, my love.

856
01:07:42,833 --> 01:07:43,750
Oh, Angus.

857
01:07:43,833 --> 01:07:45,833
[both laughing]

858
01:07:46,708 --> 01:07:49,042
- [Angus laughs]
- [woman squeals and giggles]

859
01:07:50,375 --> 01:07:52,000
- Maybe I'll see you later, then.
- Sure.

860
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:55,042
[woman] Is that Robert?

861
01:07:55,417 --> 01:07:56,417
Our new king.

862
01:07:58,458 --> 01:07:59,458
Aye.

863
01:08:02,375 --> 01:08:03,792
Welcome, Your Majesty.

864
01:08:04,083 --> 01:08:05,750
It's good to see you again, Aine.

865
01:08:05,958 --> 01:08:08,167

And one man to remove the knight.

875
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:50,833
And then to kill him.

876
01:08:51,333 --> 01:08:52,875
Weak spots under the arm,

01:08:53,417 --> 01:08:56,417
the neck... On your feet.
And in the groin.

[grunts]

879
01:08:57,667 --> 01:09:01,042
You go near my daughter again,
I'll cut them off and use them as bait.

01:09:06,875 --> 01:09:09,434
- I'll kick your bloody arse, Douglas, eh?
- [James] You taste sweeter!

884
01:09:09,458 --> 01:09:11,739
- [Angus] You think that's bloody funny?
- [Robert laughs]

885
01:09:11,833 --> 01:09:13,000
Right. Who's next?

886
01:09:19,500 --> 01:09:20,667
[door opens]

887
01:09:24,542 --> 01:09:25,542
[Elizabeth sighs]

888
01:09:25,958 --> 01:09:27,042
[whispers] Thank goodness.

889
01:09:27,292 --> 01:09:30,500
[nun] I'm to take the girl
to our convent for religious training.

890
01:09:32,875 --> 01:09:33,875
Only the girl.

891
01:09:39,458 --> 01:09:40,458
Oh.

892
01:09:44,667 --> 01:09:46,292
Isn't that wonderful?

893
01:09:46,792 --> 01:09:48,542
The sisters want to look after you.

894
01:09:49,667 --> 01:09:52,000
And they are gonna take
such good care of you.

895
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:54,000
Come, child.

896
01:09:54,250 --> 01:09:55,250
Are you coming?

897
01:09:57,792 --> 01:09:58,792
No.

898
01:09:59,917 --> 01:10:01,250
No, but...

899
01:10:02,542 --> 01:10:04,042
we'll all be home again soon.

900
01:10:04,542 --> 01:10:05,542
I'm certain of it.

901
01:10:06,042 --> 01:10:07,167
And Father?

902
01:10:09,250 --> 01:10:10,250
Mm-hmm.

903
01:10:10,708 --> 01:10:12,125
Come on. Come here.

904
01:10:12,792 --> 01:10:14,792
- No.
- Come on, Marjorie.

905
01:10:14,875 --> 01:10:16,208
Please, don't make this hard.

906
01:10:16,292 --> 01:10:19,083
[whimpering]
No, I don't want to go! No!

907
01:10:19,167 --> 01:10:22,125
Marjorie, I'll see you soon. I promise.

908
01:10:22,250 --> 01:10:23,250
I love you.

909
01:10:23,292 --> 01:10:25,542
- No, I want to go back!
- I love you.

910
01:10:25,625 --> 01:10:27,167
- You'll be fine.
- [Marjorie] Let go!

911
01:10:27,250 --> 01:10:31,042
No. Elizabeth!
Let go of me! Elizabeth!

912
01:10:44,667 --> 01:10:50,000
[women of Islay singing in Gaelic]

913
01:11:08,458 --> 01:11:09,458
Your Grace.

914
01:11:12,708 --> 01:11:14,125
Angus's other daughter.

915
01:11:16,500 --> 01:11:20,125
Oh, here he comes.
This could get interesting.

916
01:11:20,208 --> 01:11:21,583
[Robert laughs]

917
01:11:25,125 --> 01:11:26,750
Kildrummy’s fallen.

918
01:11:28,083 --> 01:11:29,500
Every man massacred.

919
01:11:29,917 --> 01:11:32,417
Your brother was hanged,
drawn and quartered.

920
01:11:36,083 --> 01:11:37,583
My wife? My daughter?

921
01:11:38,500 --> 01:11:39,583
They’re both alive.

922
01:11:40,292 --> 01:11:41,667
Taken by the Prince.

923
01:11:57,417 --> 01:11:58,750
We have to go back.

924
01:12:04,375 --> 01:12:06,375
[breathing heavily]

925
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:25,500
You wanted to be king.

926
01:12:26,417 --> 01:12:27,667
Well, you're king now.

927
01:12:28,333 --> 01:12:29,708
This is the price you pay.

928
01:12:32,083 --> 01:12:34,208
We only win if you survive.

929
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:47,417
Thinking about revenge?

930
01:12:51,750 --> 01:12:52,875
I know the feeling.

931
01:12:56,125 --> 01:12:58,167
It tears at the soul.

932
01:13:03,167 --> 01:13:05,000
But it can also be a weapon.

933
01:13:12,292 --> 01:13:13,500
No more chivalry.

934
01:13:17,167 --> 01:13:19,042
Now we fight like wolves.

935
01:13:31,625 --> 01:13:32,917
[soldier] Open the gate.

936
01:13:36,167 --> 01:13:38,292
- You know him?
- Aye.

937
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:43,000
Come on, James.

938
01:13:56,792 --> 01:13:58,542
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

939
01:14:00,917 --> 01:14:01,917
Lord Bruce.

940
01:14:02,750 --> 01:14:04,000
Your Majesty.

941
01:14:05,042 --> 01:14:06,042
Your Majesty.

942
01:14:06,333 --> 01:14:07,333
Iain.

943
01:14:13,292 --> 01:14:14,458
[soldier] You’re late.

944
01:14:14,917 --> 01:14:15,917
Where have you been?

945
01:14:16,458 --> 01:14:21,000
[Iain] Aye, sorry. Wheel came clean off.
Took an age to fix it.

946
01:14:21,167 --> 01:14:22,792
[soldier] Yeah, well, come on!

947
01:14:22,875 --> 01:14:25,167
Let’s unload this
before they gut the both of us.

948
01:15:04,958 --> 01:15:06,250
[soldier shouts the alarm]

949
01:15:07,708 --> 01:15:09,208
[soldier] By the gate!

950
01:15:11,250 --> 01:15:12,792
What've you got in there?

951
01:15:13,083 --> 01:15:14,625
- Porridge.
- Oh...

952
01:15:14,917 --> 01:15:16,583
I'll have some of that, then.

953
01:15:17,625 --> 01:15:19,125
Come on, get me a bowl.

954
01:15:19,958 --> 01:15:20,958
Of course.

955
01:15:21,792 --> 01:15:24,000
- [James roars]
- [screams]

956
01:15:30,500 --> 01:15:32,167
[man] Come on!

957
01:15:34,125 --> 01:15:35,750
[Angus] Follow me!

958
01:15:46,292 --> 01:15:47,667
Die, you bastard!

959
01:15:47,750 --> 01:15:49,333
To the stairs! Follow me!

960
01:15:49,417 --> 01:15:51,875
[man] Arm yourselves! Arm yourselves!

961
01:16:12,708 --> 01:16:14,708
[panting]

962
01:16:14,792 --> 01:16:16,333
Seamus. Are you all right?

963
01:16:16,958 --> 01:16:19,042
[Seamus]
Your Majesty! It’s good to have you home.

964
01:16:19,167 --> 01:16:21,167
We can’t stay.
They’ll know where we are.

965
01:16:21,375 --> 01:16:23,083
- You’re all to come with us.
- Aye.

966
01:16:24,958 --> 01:16:26,875
We take what we can, and burn it down.

967
01:16:26,958 --> 01:16:29,198
- [Seamus] Gayle!
- [Robert] Leave nothing for the enemy.

968
01:16:31,667 --> 01:16:33,208
[Angus] Burn it! Burn it all!

969
01:16:39,208 --> 01:16:40,667
This is how we do it.

970
01:16:40,833 --> 01:16:42,250
We travel in stealth.

971
01:16:42,500 --> 01:16:43,750
Strike without warning.

972
01:16:44,708 --> 01:16:49,333
Take the land back castle by castle,
destroying them as we go.

973
01:16:49,958 --> 01:16:52,708
[Angus]
It’s not exactly chivalry, but I like it.

974
01:16:52,833 --> 01:16:55,583
Burn it all and take what you can!

975
01:16:55,667 --> 01:16:56,750
[man] Let's move!

976
01:16:57,708 --> 01:17:00,458
Robert, you know,
my father’s land is only a day’s ride.

977
01:17:00,792 --> 01:17:03,500
It would mean so much to me
if I could take it myself.

978
01:17:04,292 --> 01:17:06,625
You know, I’d only need two or three men.

979
01:17:07,833 --> 01:17:08,833
Take five.

980
01:17:09,292 --> 01:17:10,875
And keep your wits about you.

981
01:17:11,458 --> 01:17:14,417
I've already lost two brothers,
I can't bear to lose another.

982
01:17:14,500 --> 01:17:15,667
Everyone out!

983
01:17:16,875 --> 01:17:18,042
Good luck, boy.

984
01:17:21,167 --> 01:17:23,500
[church bell ringing]

985
01:17:32,083 --> 01:17:33,375
[woman shrieks]

986
01:17:34,667 --> 01:17:36,542
[man] Palm Sunday...

987
01:17:42,458 --> 01:17:44,792
[church bell ringing]

988
01:17:52,208 --> 01:17:55,125
[priest chanting] <i>Alleluia!</i>

989
01:18:00,958 --> 01:18:02,625
[congregation chanting]

990
01:18:23,042 --> 01:18:25,333
[congregation chanting louder]
<i>Alleluia!</i>

991
01:18:39,417 --> 01:18:42,375
[screams] Douglas!

992
01:18:42,458 --> 01:18:44,792
[congregation screaming in panic]

993
01:18:58,500 --> 01:19:01,833
[shouts] Douglas!

994
01:19:15,583 --> 01:19:18,250
I watched once, from that very window,

995
01:19:19,292 --> 01:19:22,417
my mother and father standing
in this courtyard.

996
01:19:22,958 --> 01:19:26,292
And my father whispering
in my mother’s ear.

997
01:19:28,208 --> 01:19:31,208
I don’t know what he said,
but it must have been funny because she...

998
01:19:31,792 --> 01:19:33,792
[chuckles] she couldn’t stop laughing.

999
01:19:45,417 --> 01:19:47,000
I used to drink this water.

1000
01:19:49,375 --> 01:19:51,750
Poison it.
Throw the bastards down the well.

1001
01:19:53,042 --> 01:19:54,500
Where’s that cunt Clifford?

1002
01:19:54,750 --> 01:19:56,875
[man] He’s gone to join Valence, my lord.

1003
01:19:59,375 --> 01:20:01,375
Well, then, I’ll see him soon enough.

1004
01:20:03,333 --> 01:20:06,208
Friends, don't be afraid. Please join me.

1005
01:20:08,250 --> 01:20:09,250
[prisoner screams] No!

1006
01:20:09,792 --> 01:20:12,792
Come, enjoy this Palm Sunday feast.

1007
01:20:13,250 --> 01:20:15,083
It was prepared for your enemies.

1008
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:17,458
It is yours now.

1009
01:20:17,542 --> 01:20:20,208
As is everything in my family’s castle.

1010
01:20:20,792 --> 01:20:24,333
I serve Robert Bruce, King of Scots!

1011
01:20:24,417 --> 01:20:26,500
Join us to free our land!

1012
01:20:26,583 --> 01:20:27,875
[crowd cheers loudly]

1013
01:20:38,667 --> 01:20:41,375
Sir Richard's castle
in Scotland has also fallen.

1014
01:20:42,958 --> 01:20:44,875
The man responsible may have been mad.

1015
01:20:45,750 --> 01:20:48,792
He was heard screaming
the same word over and over.

1016
01:20:49,208 --> 01:20:50,208
Douglas.

1017
01:20:51,125 --> 01:20:53,792
He claimed to be fighting
for Robert the Bruce.

1018
01:20:54,750 --> 01:20:57,500
The outlaws continue
to sack their own castles,

1019
01:20:58,417 --> 01:21:02,958
and as word of Bruce's exploits spreads,
so does his support amongst the people.

1020
01:21:08,667 --> 01:21:12,625
Of course, there are still nobles
who remain loyal to the Crown.

1021
01:21:15,083 --> 01:21:16,083
This morning...

1022
01:21:17,625 --> 01:21:18,625
I woke up...

1023
01:21:21,167 --> 01:21:22,708
performed my ablutions,

1024
01:21:23,833 --> 01:21:28,208
and then walked
from my bedchamber to the great hall.

1025
01:21:28,792 --> 01:21:32,083
And on the way, I stumbled.

1026
01:21:34,792 --> 01:21:36,083
No reason, just...

1027
01:21:39,250 --> 01:21:40,583
just lost my footing.

1028
01:21:43,125 --> 01:21:46,167
Well, I lose my footing sometimes.

1029
01:21:46,833 --> 01:21:49,750
Especially in the morning
when the body is still waking up.

1030
01:21:52,708 --> 01:21:55,417
It was my hope to grow old

1031
01:21:56,042 --> 01:21:57,958
and not die on the battlefield.

1032
01:21:58,583 --> 01:22:00,292
But I see now

1033
01:22:00,375 --> 01:22:03,292
that the great danger
in a death from natural causes

1034
01:22:03,542 --> 01:22:06,792
is that one may
be lying in one's bedchamber,

1035
01:22:08,125 --> 01:22:10,042
thinking of all the things

1036
01:22:10,583 --> 01:22:13,458
that have been left undone.

1037
01:22:16,750 --> 01:22:21,542
Fear not, Father.
We will not fail you again.

1038
01:22:23,958 --> 01:22:26,375
Well, you managed to imprison a few women.

1039
01:22:36,292 --> 01:22:39,458
These gentlemen of France
were in the dungeon. They wish to join us.

1040
01:22:43,083 --> 01:22:45,208
[speaking French]

1041
01:22:45,417 --> 01:22:46,708
[speaking French]

1042
01:22:46,833 --> 01:22:47,833
[boy] Is it true?

1043
01:22:48,750 --> 01:22:50,125
You’re the King of Scots?

1044
01:22:50,500 --> 01:22:52,750
[Angus]
He certainly is, you cheeky wee shite.

1045
01:22:58,125 --> 01:22:59,125
Hey.

1046
01:22:59,833 --> 01:23:02,458
Go tell all your friends
we’re going to win our country back.

1047
01:23:02,958 --> 01:23:05,042
Aye, Sire. Come on, Arthur.

1048
01:23:06,792 --> 01:23:07,851
[boy] Is that really the King?

1049
01:23:07,875 --> 01:23:10,375
[man] Robert. I bring more men.

1050
01:23:14,500 --> 01:23:15,875
- Drew!
- [Drew] Your Majesty.

1051
01:23:15,958 --> 01:23:18,598
- [Angus] Good to have you back!
- [man] We found them on the road.

1052
01:23:18,833 --> 01:23:20,333
[Euan] We thought you were dead!

1053
01:23:20,417 --> 01:23:21,958
[man] They tried to ambush us!

1054
01:23:23,875 --> 01:23:25,458
I have something for you, Sire.

1055
01:23:25,875 --> 01:23:27,750
I managed to take it from Methven.

1056
01:23:35,042 --> 01:23:36,042
Rise.

1057
01:23:39,917 --> 01:23:41,167
You look after this for me.

1058
01:23:42,583 --> 01:23:44,333
You’ve done a grand job so far.

1059
01:23:46,333 --> 01:23:47,667
