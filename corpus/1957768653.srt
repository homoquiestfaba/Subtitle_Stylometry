[intense rock music continues]

4
00:04:48,388 --> 00:04:50,857
- Five, ten, and 15.

5
00:04:50,857 --> 00:04:53,293
Now, remember you have to
wait at least six weeks

6
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:55,195
before you can sell blood again.

7
00:04:55,195 --> 00:04:57,798
- Shit, I need more than
this. It's not enough.

8
00:04:58,899 --> 00:05:00,700
- Well, I hope we see more of you here.

9
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,903
You know, you have an
extremely rare blood type.

10
00:05:02,903 --> 00:05:05,038
- Well, you can have some
more right now if you want to.

11
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:06,907
I could use some another 15 bucks.

12
00:05:06,907 --> 00:05:09,309
- But I'm afraid that's against the rules.

13
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:10,777
We have to wait a full six weeks

14
00:05:10,777 --> 00:05:13,880
before we can accept blood
from the same person again.

15
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:17,184
- And I bet you're a real
stickler for the rules, right?

16
00:05:17,184 --> 00:05:20,320
- Well, I can't accept
another blood donation now,

17
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:23,657
but you could be of great
service to this clinic

18
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:25,926
and be paid generously for the effort.

19
00:05:25,926 --> 00:05:27,227
- How generously?

20
00:05:27,227 --> 00:05:30,030
- How does a hundred
dollars a day sound to you?

21
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:31,598
- A hundred dollars a day?

22
00:05:31,598 --> 00:05:32,933
You're shittin' me, right?

23
00:05:32,933 --> 00:05:35,035
- We can begin now if you want to.

24
00:05:36,102 --> 00:05:39,439
- Well, what do you want to do?

25
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:41,608
- Just let me run a few simple tests.

26
00:05:41,608 --> 00:05:42,843
You see, for these sort of tests,

27
00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:46,346
young women of your age
range make the best subjects.

28
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:49,082
And if we begin now, we could
be finished by the evening

29
00:05:49,082 --> 00:05:51,484
and you'll be a hundred dollars richer.

30
00:05:51,484 --> 00:05:53,620
- Hey, let's go.

31
00:05:59,426 --> 00:06:00,861
What's in that?

32
00:06:01,828 --> 00:06:04,130
- Just a type of vaccine.

33
00:06:05,432 --> 00:06:07,968
I wanna test your body's reaction to it.

34
00:06:07,968 --> 00:06:11,504
It was designed to stimulate
the body's defense mechanism

35
00:06:11,504 --> 00:06:14,074
to make the human organism
literally invulnerable

36
00:06:14,074 --> 00:06:16,142
against disease, fatigue.

37
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:18,778
When I perfect the serum,

38
00:06:18,778 --> 00:06:20,747
the human life expectancy may be stretched

39
00:06:20,747 --> 00:06:24,751
by 20, 30, maybe even 50 years.

40
00:06:24,751 --> 00:06:27,020
And if my tests are successful,

41
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:29,022
you'll be the first to benefit.

42
00:06:29,022 --> 00:06:31,658
[chuckles]
- I don't know about all that,

43
00:06:31,658 --> 00:06:34,761
but as long as you keep the
cash coming, I'll be back.

44
00:06:36,763 --> 00:06:37,998
- I'm sure you will.

45
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:43,803
[intense rock music]

46
00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:55,015
[coughing]

47
00:06:57,517 --> 00:06:59,653
- Are you okay, ma'am?

48
00:06:59,653 --> 00:07:01,655
Are you sure you're okay, ma'am?

49
00:07:01,655 --> 00:07:03,156
You know there's a
drugstore down the street

50
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:05,158
if you wanna get something to put on that.

51
00:07:05,158 --> 00:07:06,326
It could get infected.

52
00:07:06,326 --> 00:07:09,062
- No, no, I'm all right.

53
00:07:09,062 --> 00:07:11,298
- [Man] Okay, you're the boss.

54
00:07:11,298 --> 00:07:13,533
All right, I tried to help.

55
00:07:14,534 --> 00:07:17,671
[intense rock music]

56
00:07:41,861 --> 00:07:44,965
- When I left here, I felt kind of sick.

57
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:47,467
A kind of nausea, I guess.

58
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:49,169
- That's perfectly natural.

59
00:07:49,169 --> 00:07:52,205
Your body is adjusting to
a new chemical component,

60
00:07:52,205 --> 00:07:54,808
but in a few days, my serum
will be completely absorbed

61
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:58,244
into your blood and then you
should feel completely fine.

62
00:07:58,244 --> 00:08:00,847
- But it was more than just stomach pains.

63
00:08:00,847 --> 00:08:02,115
Something else happened.

64
00:08:03,183 --> 00:08:06,219
I cut my leg when I fell
on some broken glass

65
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:07,320
and when I looked at the blood,

66
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,956
I felt a strange kind of hunger.

67
00:08:11,358 --> 00:08:13,093
I wanted to taste the blood.

68
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:16,596
- Interesting. And did you?

69
00:08:16,596 --> 00:08:18,698
- Did I?
- Did you taste the blood?

70
00:08:19,632 --> 00:08:20,500
- Yes.

71
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:24,070
And when I did, the pain was gone.

72
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:25,338
Isn't that strange?

73
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,008
- Well, not necessarily.

74
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:30,643
Sometimes the mind makes
subconscious associations

75
00:08:30,643 --> 00:08:32,645
between psychological trauma

76
00:08:32,645 --> 00:08:36,349
and something more tangible, physical.

77
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:37,784
I'm sure that's all it was.

78
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,255
There, the serum's ready.

79
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:46,026
I'm slightly increasing your dosage today.

80
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:48,962
Soon I'll know if my
experiment is a success.

81
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:56,469
[people chattering indistinctly]

82
00:09:03,176 --> 00:09:05,045
[spits]

83
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:06,613
- This is awful.

84
00:09:06,613 --> 00:09:07,847
- [Waiter] Is there anything wrong here?

85
00:09:07,847 --> 00:09:10,116
- Yeah. This tastes like shit.

86
00:09:10,116 --> 00:09:10,984
- Well, we haven't had any complaints.

87
00:09:10,984 --> 00:09:13,820
- Well, I'm complaining.
This isn't fit to drink.

88
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:16,356
- Well you still owe me two bucks.

89
00:09:16,356 --> 00:09:17,824
You're gonna pay for it.

90
00:09:17,824 --> 00:09:18,758
- Here.

91
00:09:18,758 --> 00:09:20,560
I hope you fuckin' choke on it.

92
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,128
- I don't have to stand
for this kind of talk.

93
00:09:22,128 --> 00:09:23,063
You get outta here.

94
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:24,764
- I don't know what kind of dive this is,

95
00:09:24,764 --> 00:09:26,299
but it's no restaurant.

96
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:27,100
See ya.

97
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:34,374
[people chattering indistinctly]

98
00:09:34,374 --> 00:09:38,378
[women chattering indistinctly]

99
00:09:50,824 --> 00:09:53,359
- She looks like she's psycho.

100
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:05,839
Nicole, do we have to stand
around here all night?

101
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:07,340
I wanna go home.

102
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:10,176
- Yeah? Well, if you
go, it'll be your loss.

103
00:10:10,176 --> 00:10:12,145
You know who's staying here, don't you?

104
00:10:12,145 --> 00:10:14,447
- No, and I really don't care.

105
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:17,584
- You don't care that Irwin R.
Stone is supposed to be here?

106
00:10:17,584 --> 00:10:20,153
Stone Productions? The movie producer?

107
00:10:20,153 --> 00:10:22,088
Is any of this sinking in, Robin?

108
00:10:22,088 --> 00:10:22,889
- So what?

109
00:10:22,889 --> 00:10:25,158
You think he's gonna put
you in his next movie?

110
00:10:25,158 --> 00:10:27,627
Just gimme five minutes
with the fat bastard.

111
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:30,563
I'll be under a contract
before his pants hit the floor.

112
00:10:30,563 --> 00:10:32,065
- That's what I like about you, Nicole.

113
00:10:32,065 --> 00:10:33,399
You're so humble.

114
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:34,467
- Modest, too.

115
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:38,404
That's why guys shit themselves
over me, 'cause I'm a lady.

116
00:10:39,405 --> 00:10:40,406
That's him.

117
00:10:40,406 --> 00:10:42,142
- You sure?
- Look.

118
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:43,810
This picture, it's him.

119
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:45,478
- Well, I guess it looks like him.

120
00:10:46,412 --> 00:10:48,114
- This is it. Wish me luck.

121
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:50,650
- Well, are you gonna get
me a part in the movie too?

122
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:51,985
- Who am I, Robin?

123
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:53,086
Your agent?

124
00:10:55,421 --> 00:10:57,223
Mr. Stone.
- Yes?

125
00:10:57,223 --> 00:10:58,892
- I can't believe it's really you.

126
00:10:58,892 --> 00:11:00,393
I heard you might be staying here,

127
00:11:00,393 --> 00:11:02,962
so, well, here I am.

128
00:11:02,962 --> 00:11:04,731
- You certainly are, aren't you?

129
00:11:04,731 --> 00:11:06,666
- I hope you don't think
I'm being too forward.

130
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,168
- No, no, no, no, no.

131
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:09,002
I'll tell you what,

132
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:11,004
I'll bet you're a friend
of Mel's aren't you?

133
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:12,305
- Mel?

134
00:11:12,305 --> 00:11:14,507
Oh yeah. Sure.

135
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:17,343
You know, Mel thought
you might hit it off.

136
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:18,311
What do you think?

137
00:11:18,311 --> 00:11:21,948
- I think Mel's a hell of
a guy. A hell of a guy.

138
00:11:21,948 --> 00:11:23,183
I'll tell you what, I
bet you you could use

139
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:24,817
a refreshment and guess what?

140
00:11:24,817 --> 00:11:27,353
I have a brand new bottle of
Boone's Farm up in the room.

141
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:30,390
- Boone's Farm? Oh, that's my favorite.

142
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:33,459
Maybe we could slip on back up?

143
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:34,727
- Okay.

144
00:11:34,727 --> 00:11:35,595
Okay.

145
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:40,700
Well here we are.

146
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,669
I'll tell you what, why don't you relax

147
00:11:42,669 --> 00:11:45,371
and I'll pour us a tall glass of vino.

148
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:48,608
- Mr. Stone, I didn't
know you spoke Italian.

149
00:11:48,608 --> 00:11:49,475
You're so cultured.

150
00:11:49,475 --> 00:11:52,412
- I've got plenty of
surprises up my sleeves.

151
00:11:52,412 --> 00:11:55,014
- Maybe so, but it's not
what's up your sleeve

152
00:11:55,014 --> 00:11:57,784
I came to see.
- Mm, that sounds good.

153
00:11:57,784 --> 00:11:59,018
Why don't you just relax

154
00:11:59,018 --> 00:12:00,286
and let me get that glass of wine

155
00:12:00,286 --> 00:12:02,222
and we'll be ready to loosen up.

156
00:12:05,925 --> 00:12:09,229
So, uh, what do you do for a living?

157
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:11,064
- [Nicole] Oh, I'm an actress.

158
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:12,999
A very good actress.

159
00:12:12,999 --> 00:12:14,133
- Really?

160
00:12:14,133 --> 00:12:16,302
You think I might have
seen you in anything?

161
00:12:16,302 --> 00:12:19,539
- [Nicole] That depends. Did
you see Alien Egg Layers?

162
00:12:19,539 --> 00:12:21,441
I was the nude alien queen.

163
00:12:21,441 --> 00:12:22,942
- You were?

164
00:12:22,942 --> 00:12:24,711
- [Nicole] Then I had a cameo in Hell Camp

165
00:12:24,711 --> 00:12:25,979
as the nude swimmer.

166
00:12:25,979 --> 00:12:27,981
I'm killed in the pre-credit sequence,

167
00:12:27,981 --> 00:12:30,183
so you might have missed me.

168
00:12:30,183 --> 00:12:32,085
- I think I saw that one on cable,

169
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:34,387
but I'm still trying to place you.

170
00:12:34,387 --> 00:12:36,990
- Does this jog your memory?

171
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:38,491
- Yeah.

172
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:40,159
Yeah, it does.

173
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:44,197
In fact, you look really, really good.

174
00:12:44,197 --> 00:12:46,699
- Do you remember the
scene in Alien Egg Layers

175
00:12:46,699 --> 00:12:49,002
when I lure the handsome earth stud

176
00:12:49,002 --> 00:12:52,005
to my spaceship for breeding experiments?

177
00:12:52,005 --> 00:12:54,173
- No, I don't think I saw that one.

178
00:12:54,173 --> 00:12:56,442
- Let's pretend we're on the set

179
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:59,012
and the director yells action.

180
00:12:59,012 --> 00:12:59,979
[man chuckles]

181
00:12:59,979 --> 00:13:01,414
- Okay. Yeah.

182
00:13:01,414 --> 00:13:03,916
Yeah, I could be up for some action.

183
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:06,953
- I bet you can picture me
in your next film, can't you?

184
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:09,422
That's what my whole career
has been leading up to,

185
00:13:09,422 --> 00:13:13,326
to star in an Irwin R. Stone production.

186
00:13:13,326 --> 00:13:14,827
- Irwin?

187
00:13:14,827 --> 00:13:16,129
My name's Murray.

188
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:17,830
What are you talking about?

189
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:20,566
- You're not Irwin R.
Stone, the film producer?

190
00:13:20,566 --> 00:13:24,237
- No, I'm Murray J. Stone,
the carpet salesman.

191
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:29,509
- I don't believe this.

192
00:13:29,509 --> 00:13:32,245
Oh God, I almost fucked a carpet salesman.

193
00:13:32,245 --> 00:13:34,614
- [Murray] Hey, salesman of the year.

194
00:13:34,614 --> 00:13:37,550
- You're no salesman, you rapist!

195
00:13:39,018 --> 00:13:41,821
[heavy breathing]

196
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:51,564
- What do you mean rapist?

197
00:13:51,564 --> 00:13:53,099
I didn't touch you.

198
00:13:53,099 --> 00:13:55,068
- I've got to find Robin.

199
00:13:55,068 --> 00:13:57,136
She's probably met the real Stone.

200
00:13:59,472 --> 00:14:01,607
He's probably giving her my part.

201
00:14:03,309 --> 00:14:05,978
Robin, Robin!

202
00:14:09,615 --> 00:14:12,118
[door creaks]

203
00:14:15,755 --> 00:14:16,923
- Hey, listen.

204
00:14:16,923 --> 00:14:19,092
I don't care what that girl told you,

205
00:14:19,092 --> 00:14:20,927
I didn't touch her, I didn't rape her.

206
00:14:24,063 --> 00:14:27,266
- I know that. I've been watching you.

207
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:31,304
- And you might as well know, too.

208
00:14:31,304 --> 00:14:33,806
I'm not a big Hollywood producer.

209
00:14:33,806 --> 00:14:36,642
I'm just a carpet salesman
that's here from Jersey.

210
00:14:36,642 --> 00:14:38,444
Salesman of the year, but-

211
00:14:38,444 --> 00:14:39,779
Hey you okay?

212
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:40,947
- I think I'm sick.

213
00:14:41,848 --> 00:14:43,383
- You're sick?
- I need you to help me.

214
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:45,518
- Come here, lay down.

215
00:14:45,518 --> 00:14:46,419
Lay down here.

216
00:14:47,687 --> 00:14:49,389
You need something to drink?

217
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:50,623
- That's why I came.

218
00:14:52,091 --> 00:14:53,025
To drink.

219
00:14:55,094 --> 00:14:56,062
- Here.

220
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:58,798
Not wine.

221
00:14:59,832 --> 00:15:02,535
- I got a couple beers
left over. You want a beer?

222
00:15:06,973 --> 00:15:10,042
- A little closer.

223
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:14,814
I need to drink…

224
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:19,051
[snarls]

225
00:15:19,051 --> 00:15:24,056
[Murray yelling]
[intense rock music]

226
00:15:46,179 --> 00:15:49,182
[pounding on door]

227
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:54,620
- What is going on in here?

228
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,422
I'm trying to get some sleep.

229
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:02,795
[Caroline snarls]
[intense rock music]

230
00:16:03,229 --> 00:16:05,131
What's wrong with you?

231
00:16:05,131 --> 00:16:07,300
You're covered in blood,
stay away from me!

232
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:12,305
[woman screams]
[intense rock music]

233
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:22,515
[Caroline snarls]
[intense rock music]

234
00:16:39,732 --> 00:16:42,535
- Your color looks much
better today, Caroline.

235
00:16:42,535 --> 00:16:43,936
- You think so?

236
00:16:43,936 --> 00:16:46,839
- Absolutely. I think my
serum is having an effect.

237
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:48,508
Wouldn't you agree?

238
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:50,510
- I think it is, doctor.

239
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:52,512
Do you have my hundred dollars?

240
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:54,680
- I know, business first.

241
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,548
We better get busy.

242
00:16:55,548 --> 00:16:58,217
I have a whole series of
tests to run on you today.

243
00:16:58,217 --> 00:17:00,419
- I want to show you something first.

244
00:17:00,419 --> 00:17:02,021
- Really?

245
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:03,756
- Ever since last night,

246
00:17:05,091 --> 00:17:07,493
I now know what that serum is doing to me.

247
00:17:08,628 --> 00:17:10,463
- It's making you stronger.

248
00:17:10,463 --> 00:17:13,466
It's creating the ultimate
immune system in your body.

249
00:17:13,466 --> 00:17:15,034
Soon there will be no disease

250
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:16,869
or sickness that can affect you.

251
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:18,437
- But there's something else.

252
00:17:19,305 --> 00:17:22,375
It's given me a strange appetite.

253
00:17:24,243 --> 00:17:25,978
Do you want me to show you, doctor?

254
00:17:25,978 --> 00:17:27,013
- You can wait to eat

255
00:17:27,013 --> 00:17:28,748
after I'm through with these experiments.

256
00:17:28,748 --> 00:17:33,085
- But I want to show you
now so you'll understand.

257
00:17:34,687 --> 00:17:37,623
So you'll understand
what's happening to me.

258
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:42,929
- Caroline, you don't
know what you're doing.

259
00:17:45,364 --> 00:17:48,067
- I think I do, doctor.

260
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:51,137
[intense rock music]

261
00:17:58,578 --> 00:18:01,280
- Caroline, you're not feeling well.

262
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:05,918
- I'll be all right,
doctor. After I've eaten.

263
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:07,587
[screaming]

264
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:12,592

265

[people chattering indistinctly]

266
00:18:50,329 --> 00:18:52,465
- You look like you need some company.

267
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:54,133
- Not-
- Come on, honey.

268
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:56,802
- Not tonight, honey.
- Oh, no…

269
00:18:59,205 --> 00:19:00,573
- No, I'm in a hurry tonight.

270
00:19:00,573 --> 00:19:02,174
- No, you're going with us tonight.

271
00:19:02,174 --> 00:19:04,143
- No, not tonight.
- Let's go.

272
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:06,278
- I can't tonight. No, no.

273
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:12,652
No come on, I'm busy tonight. Come on.

274
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:14,253
No, get away.

275
00:19:14,253 --> 00:19:15,921
Look, find somebody else. Come on.

276
00:19:15,921 --> 00:19:20,926
- Come on, come with us.

277
00:19:23,095 --> 00:19:24,263
- What's wrong with that guy?

278
00:19:24,263 --> 00:19:25,131
- What a jerk.

279
00:19:25,131 --> 00:19:29,035
Let's go find somebody else.
- All right, yeah.

280
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:35,107
Forget that guy, he's an idiot.

281
00:19:35,107 --> 00:19:39,612
- We'll find somebody else.
- We're find real one.

282
00:19:39,612 --> 00:19:41,147
Hey, what do you think her problem is?

283
00:19:41,147 --> 00:19:42,748
- I don't know.
[laughing]

284
00:19:42,748 --> 00:19:45,851
Hey lady, this isn't a hotel.

285
00:19:46,686 --> 00:19:49,221
God, she's had a lot more
to drink than we have.

286
00:19:49,221 --> 00:19:51,624
- She looks like she needs
to have some fun. [laughs]

287
00:19:51,624 --> 00:19:52,692
- Maybe she can come with us.

288
00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:54,727
You wanna come and have some fun with us?

289
00:19:55,995 --> 00:19:57,730
A little drink, maybe?

290
00:19:57,730 --> 00:19:59,131
Come on, let's take her with us.

291
00:19:59,131 --> 00:20:00,599
She'll have a lot of fun.
- Yeah, come on.

292
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:01,967
We'll show you a real party.

293
00:20:01,967 --> 00:20:04,203
- [Girl In Blue] We can
party all night long.

294
00:20:06,272 --> 00:20:07,139
- [Girl In White Jacket] I
think this girl's been doing

295
00:20:07,139 --> 00:20:09,742
some partying herself.
- Doing some serious drinking.

296
00:20:09,742 --> 00:20:11,077
- Some serious partying.

297
00:20:11,077 --> 00:20:12,211
- Let's go show her a good time.

298
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:14,580
- Let's show her a real party.

299
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:15,981
- [Girl In Blue] Trust me,
you'll be the life of the party.

300
00:20:15,981 --> 00:20:17,283
Just come with us.

[intense rock music]

307
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:14,373
- Forget about her. Now
it's just me and you.

308
00:21:16,842 --> 00:21:17,777
- Not here.

309
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:22,748
- Take me where you want.

Lisa.

00:23:07,786 --> 00:23:09,321
What happened?

320
00:23:09,321 --> 00:23:11,857
Why did you storm outta
here? What's wrong?

321
00:23:12,691 --> 00:23:14,426
- Amy, look, there's no sense in even

322
00:23:14,426 --> 00:23:15,861
talking about it anymore.

323
00:23:15,861 --> 00:23:18,163
I'm not coming back.

324
00:23:18,163 --> 00:23:19,398
It's over.

325
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:22,601
- No, don't leave me.

326

Please, I promise it'll
never happen again.

327
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:27,072
No, please. One more chance.

328
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:29,575
I, I, I, fucked up okay?

329
00:23:29,575 --> 00:23:30,876
Okay?

330
00:23:30,876 --> 00:23:32,845
No, I won't do it again!

331
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:37,416
No, please, don't, don't leave me!

332
00:23:38,517 --> 00:23:40,452
- Yeah, that's what you said last time

333
00:23:40,452 --> 00:23:43,355
and you promised it the time before that.

334
00:23:43,355 --> 00:23:46,525
Look, I need some kind commitment.

335
00:23:46,525 --> 00:23:48,260
I need a real relationship.

336
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:51,030
And if you can't give me that,
well then we're finished.

337
00:23:52,331 --> 00:23:54,400
Look, I've got my things packed.

338
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,334
I just need a place.

339
00:23:55,334 --> 00:23:58,771
I just need to get my life together, okay?

340
00:23:58,771 --> 00:24:00,272
Amy.

341
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:02,274
Amy, it's over, okay? Goodbye.

342
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:05,244

00:24:21,794 --> 00:24:23,429
- What's wrong?

346
00:24:23,429 --> 00:24:25,464
Are you sick?

347
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:27,032
- I'll be all right.

348
00:24:27,032 --> 00:24:29,234
- Are you sure?
- I just feel kind of faint.

349
00:24:30,035 --> 00:24:32,471
- Oh my gosh. I, I'm
sitting here watching you.

350
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:34,840
Maybe you need a doctor.
- No!

351
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:37,176
No doctors. You have to promise.

352
00:24:38,911 --> 00:24:40,746
- Okay, no doctors.

353
00:24:40,746 --> 00:24:44,817
All right, maybe you're
not as sick as I thought.

354
00:24:44,817 --> 00:24:47,286
- It's just, I'm so hungry.

Well, come on, you said you were starving.

Help yourself.

372
00:25:39,438 --> 00:25:42,641
- I can't, really. It's not what I need.

373
00:25:43,609 --> 00:25:47,046
Look, you've been very
nice, but I have to go.

377
00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:01,660
You were so weak. You fainted twice.

So, um, I need a place tonight.

384
00:26:23,949 --> 00:26:27,086
You wouldn't happen to know of
any cheap motels, would you?

385
00:26:27,086 --> 00:26:29,388
- I happen to be an
expert on cheap hotels.

386
00:26:29,388 --> 00:26:30,255
Although in New York,

387
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:33,492
even a roach motel can cost $50 a night.

388

- Oh, that's way over my limit.

Well, I didn't expect
to need a place tonight.

390
00:26:39,231 --> 00:26:40,599
I had a major breakup today

391
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:43,435
and I walked out before knowing
where I was gonna sleep.

and walk on me, are you?

01:03:24,334 --> 01:03:26,903
- That's right. Just step right on in.

710
01:03:26,903 --> 01:03:28,338
- What do you want?

711
01:03:28,338 --> 01:03:30,974
- I might ask you the
same thing, both of you,

712
01:03:31,908 --> 01:03:34,611
but just so we get started
off on a first name basis,

713
01:03:34,611 --> 01:03:39,616
my name is Tony and this is my
girlfriend Gina's apartment.

714
01:03:42,352 --> 01:03:46,423
Now suddenly she's gone
and you two have moved in.

715
01:03:48,625 --> 01:03:53,263
Now, I'm sure there's a reasonable
explanation for all this.

716
01:03:53,263 --> 01:03:54,264
- We live here now.

717
01:03:55,365 --> 01:03:57,701
She doesn't even live here anymore.

718
01:03:57,701 --> 01:03:59,069
- Oh, so you live here now?

719
01:04:00,270 --> 01:04:02,272
[Lisa gasps]

720
01:04:02,272 --> 01:04:04,341
I can see she's not here,

721
01:04:04,341 --> 01:04:07,344
but the landlord seems to
think she still lives here.

722
01:04:07,344 --> 01:04:08,511
And who could blame him?

723
01:04:08,511 --> 01:04:11,848
After all, this is her
furniture, these are her tapes.

724
01:04:13,950 --> 01:04:15,218
Even her clothes.

725
01:04:16,653 --> 01:04:18,855
I bought this one for her last month.

726
01:04:18,855 --> 01:04:20,590
$500.

727
01:04:20,590 --> 01:04:24,461
You telling me she left
all this stuff behind?

728
01:04:27,163 --> 01:04:30,033
- Look, she's just gone, all right.

729
01:04:30,033 --> 01:04:32,535
You're not gonna find her here anywhere.

730
01:04:33,536 --> 01:04:36,106
- You seem to be awfully sure of that.

731
01:04:36,106 --> 01:04:38,808
[Lisa gasps]

732
01:04:38,808 --> 01:04:40,543
- Leave her alone.
- Maybe you can tell me

733
01:04:40,543 --> 01:04:42,979
where I can find her.
- Just leave her alone!

734
01:04:42,979 --> 01:04:44,614
She doesn't know anything.

735
01:04:46,549 --> 01:04:51,054
- You know, I'm starting to really lose

736
01:04:51,054 --> 01:04:52,889
my fuckin' patience here.

737
01:04:54,557 --> 01:04:57,927
One of you better start
talking and real quick.

738
01:04:57,927 --> 01:04:59,829
You think I'm bluffing?

739
01:04:59,829 --> 01:05:03,833
One shot and your girlfriend
ain't got no face.

740
01:05:03,833 --> 01:05:07,504
Now, are you ready to
tell me where Gina is?

741
01:05:07,504 --> 01:05:08,571
- Okay!

742
01:05:08,571 --> 01:05:09,439
Okay.

743
01:05:10,273 --> 01:05:13,209
We talked to her the night before last,

744
01:05:13,209 --> 01:05:14,778
but just for a little bit.

745
01:05:16,513 --> 01:05:17,781
- You talked to her?

746
01:05:19,916 --> 01:05:21,518
And she invited you to come over

747
01:05:21,518 --> 01:05:23,653
and take over her fucking apartment?

748
01:05:23,653 --> 01:05:24,654
- No.

749
01:05:24,654 --> 01:05:25,789
No, it's not like that.

750
01:05:26,790 --> 01:05:29,793
I guess we told her how
we needed a place to stay.

751
01:05:29,793 --> 01:05:31,728
She said we could hang
out here for a few days

752
01:05:31,728 --> 01:05:33,363
'cause she was going out of town.

753
01:05:35,365 --> 01:05:37,734
- That's pretty fucking
convenient, isn't it?

754
01:05:37,734 --> 01:05:39,169
Especially when little miss Gina

755
01:05:39,169 --> 01:05:41,438
is in to me for about two G's now.

756
01:05:42,739 --> 01:05:46,042
Maybe I didn't mention this
in our little introductory,

757
01:05:46,042 --> 01:05:50,380
but Gina and I have a very
professional relationship.

758
01:05:50,380 --> 01:05:53,316
She takes care of me
and I take care of her.

759
01:05:56,453 --> 01:05:58,988
In other words, she's
one of the highest paid

760
01:05:58,988 --> 01:06:00,623
pieces of ass in New York.

761
01:06:02,892 --> 01:06:06,496
Now Gina makes me a lot of money

762
01:06:06,496 --> 01:06:08,198
and nobody's going to stop that.

763
01:06:09,132 --> 01:06:12,135
Not you and definitely not you.

764
01:06:12,135 --> 01:06:14,637
- Well, we could just go.

765
01:06:14,637 --> 01:06:18,641
If you don't want us
here, we'll just leave.

766
01:06:18,641 --> 01:06:21,845
- Oh, you'll just go? You
think it's that simple?

767
01:06:21,845 --> 01:06:24,781
Maybe I didn't make
myself perfectly clear,

768
01:06:24,781 --> 01:06:26,416
so let's try it like this:

769
01:06:29,352 --> 01:06:34,090
when Gina is not making
me money, I am not happy.

770
01:06:34,090 --> 01:06:35,925
And when I am not happy,

771
01:06:35,925 --> 01:06:37,794
you better fuckin' believe you two

772
01:06:37,794 --> 01:06:39,729
are not going to be happy campers.

773
01:06:42,232 --> 01:06:44,367
You say Gina's coming back?

774
01:06:44,367 --> 01:06:45,869
All right, fine.

775
01:06:46,870 --> 01:06:50,607
But until she does, you're
both working for me.

776
01:06:52,742 --> 01:06:55,945
You both look like you've got
a couple of hot little bodies.

777
01:06:55,945 --> 01:06:57,514
Yeah.

778
01:06:57,514 --> 01:06:58,615
I bet there are plenty of guys

779
01:06:58,615 --> 01:07:01,451
that would pay big time
for a crack at you two.

780
01:07:02,519 --> 01:07:03,553
So what do you say?

781
01:07:04,621 --> 01:07:06,756
- You can go to fuckin' hell.

782
01:07:08,191 --> 01:07:12,462
[slaps]
[Caroline grunts]

783
01:07:12,462 --> 01:07:15,265
- I hope I didn't damage
the merchandise too much.

784
01:07:16,566 --> 01:07:17,901
We might as well get comfortable.

785
01:07:17,901 --> 01:07:20,837
I think we're going to be
seeing a lot of each other.

786
01:07:20,837 --> 01:07:23,039
- [Lisa] You just can't keep us here.

787
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:24,908
- As long as I'm holding this,

788
01:07:24,908 --> 01:07:27,911
I think I can do whatever the fuck I want.

789
01:07:27,911 --> 01:07:30,914
Now you just help make
your girlfriend beautiful.

790
01:07:30,914 --> 01:07:32,649
You both go to work in one hour

791
01:07:33,583 --> 01:07:37,654
and you're not coming back in
here until I see $500 each.

792
01:07:39,656 --> 01:07:40,990
- You gonna be okay?
- I'll all right.

793
01:07:40,990 --> 01:07:43,059
- Gina used to keep some
pretty good chow around here

794
01:07:43,059 --> 01:07:44,861
if you bitches haven't cleaned it out.

795
01:07:44,861 --> 01:07:47,864
- No, no, no, please.

796
01:07:47,864 --> 01:07:49,432
Let me get that for you.

797
01:07:49,432 --> 01:07:50,300
I'll do it.

798
01:07:50,300 --> 01:07:52,001
- You just take care of your face, honey.

799
01:07:52,001 --> 01:07:53,736
I can take care of things in here.

800
01:07:56,506 --> 01:07:59,943
- Caroline, he's going into the kitchen.

801
01:08:03,947 --> 01:08:05,815
- What the fuck is this shit?

802
01:08:07,817 --> 01:08:09,118
This isn't Gina's.

803
01:08:11,120 --> 01:08:12,889
Those are Gina's rings…

804
01:08:14,624 --> 01:08:15,758
That's her fuckin' hand!

805
01:08:18,528 --> 01:08:19,629
Oh my God.

806
01:08:21,297 --> 01:08:23,299
You've cut her to pieces.

Oh…

820
01:10:19,215 --> 01:10:19,982
- Lisa?

821
01:10:22,819 --> 01:10:23,619
Lisa!

822
01:10:24,787 --> 01:10:27,056
Lisa, you can't die on me.

823
01:10:28,825 --> 01:10:30,593
You can't die on me.

824
01:10:31,427 --> 01:10:32,829
Lisa, I love you.

825
01:10:35,331 --> 01:10:36,733
