1
00:00:00,834 --> 00:00:01,735
(laughing)

2
00:00:01,735 --> 00:00:03,169
- Okay.

3
00:00:03,169 --> 00:00:04,004
Yeah.

4
00:00:05,872 --> 00:00:07,741
Yeah, I miss you too.

5
00:00:07,741 --> 00:00:09,275
Stop.

6
00:00:09,275 --> 00:00:12,345
You know I hate it when you do that.

7
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:16,182
Yeah, wait, I got to go.

8
00:00:16,182 --> 00:00:18,818
What are you doing, Bill?

9
00:00:18,818 --> 00:00:23,023
I thought we talked, I
thought we discussed this?

10
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:24,557
What?

11
00:00:24,557 --> 00:00:28,061
There's nobody here, if
that's what you're thinking.

12
00:00:28,061 --> 00:00:29,729
Denise is at school.

13
00:00:32,265 --> 00:00:34,334
What's that behind your back?

14
00:00:34,334 --> 00:00:35,235
What is it?

15
00:00:36,803 --> 00:00:39,806
(sighing)

16
00:00:39,806 --> 00:00:40,640
Bill.

17
00:00:41,775 --> 00:00:42,609
Damn.

18
00:00:43,443 --> 00:00:44,477
You just don't get it, do you?

19
00:00:44,477 --> 00:00:47,547
I can't take your games anymore.

20
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:49,449
I can't have you influencing Denise.

21
00:00:49,449 --> 00:00:51,618
I don't love you anymore.

22
00:00:51,618 --> 00:00:52,452
Ah.

23
00:00:54,354 --> 00:00:56,156
What did you do?

24
00:00:57,323 --> 00:00:58,425
Ah..

25
00:01:02,328 --> 00:01:05,165
(heavy breathing)

26
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:18,611
Billy?
(heavy breathing)

27
00:01:21,281 --> 00:01:23,783
Billy, what are you doing?

28
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:27,720
Ah.
(flesh tearing)

29
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:30,690
(crying out in pain)

30
00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:34,027
Ah..

31
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:41,201
(cheery music)

32
00:01:48,208 --> 00:01:50,877
(phone ringing)

33
00:01:53,746 --> 00:01:54,981
- Brandon Walker.

34
00:01:54,981 --> 00:01:55,915
Hey Mark.

35
00:01:55,915 --> 00:01:57,750
Hey, you're still coming, right?

36
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:58,585
Excellent.

37
00:01:58,585 --> 00:02:01,354
Man, we are going to have a blast.

38
00:02:01,354 --> 00:02:04,424
Hey, you're still
bringing Susan aren't you?

39
00:02:04,424 --> 00:02:05,258
No, no, no.

40
00:02:05,258 --> 00:02:06,159
Bring her.

41
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:07,894
No, we need her to be there.

42
00:02:07,894 --> 00:02:10,463
No, I haven't asked her yet.

43
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:13,399
(chuckling) Well shit, I've
been working on her for a while.

44
00:02:13,399 --> 00:02:15,301
It's now or never.

45
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:16,202
Well, I tell you what,

46
00:02:16,202 --> 00:02:17,904
bring a change of underwear

47
00:02:17,904 --> 00:02:19,372
and all that gay porn you've got

48
00:02:19,372 --> 00:02:20,740
stashed away at your house.

49
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:22,742
Because if I get shot down this weekend,

50
00:02:22,742 --> 00:02:25,678
I swear to God I'm switching teams.

51
00:02:25,678 --> 00:02:27,580
(laughing)

52
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:28,414

- Ah, dammit, David, you scared me.

76
00:03:15,395 --> 00:03:16,429
- (laughing) Yikes.

77
00:03:16,429 --> 00:03:17,397
Sorry about that sport.

78
00:03:17,397 --> 00:03:20,033
Didn't mean to give you
the old heebie-jeebies.

79
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:21,434
Say,

80
00:03:21,434 --> 00:03:25,371
you're not doing anything
important this weekend are you?

81
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:27,640
- Actually David? I'm going out of town.

82
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,242
Didn't I mention that to you?

83
00:03:29,242 --> 00:03:30,076
- Ouch.

84
00:03:30,076 --> 00:03:31,177
I hate to do this to you, old chum,

85
00:03:31,177 --> 00:03:32,779
but we really need an assist

86
00:03:32,779 --> 00:03:35,481
on that whole Lipschitz Lipinski deal.

87
00:03:35,481 --> 00:03:37,250
- Look, David.

88
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,252
I've had these plans for a while now.

89
00:03:39,252 --> 00:03:41,287
Come on, man. Can't you do it?

90
00:03:41,287 --> 00:03:45,258
- I'd really like to amigo,
but I got a prior engagement.

91
00:03:45,258 --> 00:03:48,228
(erotic music)

92
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:49,362
I just can't break it.

93
00:03:49,362 --> 00:03:51,064
Anyway, Bainbridge would
really appreciate it.

94
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:52,098
He asked for you specifically.

95
00:03:52,098 --> 00:03:53,566
So I think it'd be in
everybody's best interest

96
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:56,603
if you kind of went ahead
and came on in this weekend.

97
00:03:56,603 --> 00:03:57,870
Okay, compadre?

98
00:03:58,838 --> 00:03:59,672
- No.

99
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:02,909
- Excuse me?

100
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:04,244
- I said no, Dave.

101
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:06,179
You do this to me all the time

102
00:04:06,179 --> 00:04:07,580
and I'm not going to take it.

103
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:08,815
Not anymore.

104
00:04:08,815 --> 00:04:09,816
- Look, buddy.

105
00:04:09,816 --> 00:04:10,650
You better think about-

106
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:13,186
- Yeah, I have thought about it, David.

107
00:04:13,186 --> 00:04:15,755
All right, now I've had
these plans for over a month,

108
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:17,757
and I have got my friends waiting on me,

109
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:19,559
and I am not about to blow them off

110
00:04:19,559 --> 00:04:23,863
just because you had your
head up your ass again.

111
00:04:23,863 --> 00:04:25,031
- You son of a bitch.

112
00:04:25,031 --> 00:04:25,865
- Yeah.

113
00:04:25,865 --> 00:04:26,899
Have a good weekend, David.

114
00:04:26,899 --> 00:04:29,102
You're going to regret this, Walker.

115
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:32,272
Bainbridge asked for you specifically.

116
00:04:33,373 --> 00:04:37,043
(suspenseful music)

117
00:04:37,043 --> 00:04:40,613
(elevator dinging)

118
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:43,383
(button mashing)

119
00:04:45,051 --> 00:04:45,885
- C'mon.

120
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:49,022
(frustrated groaning)

121
00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:52,425
(fast-paced piano music)

122
00:05:06,406 --> 00:05:07,240
Tracy.

123
00:05:08,675 --> 00:05:10,043
Hey, Tracy.

124
00:05:10,043 --> 00:05:10,877
Oh, sorry.

125
00:05:11,844 --> 00:05:13,246
I didn't mean to startle you like that.

126
00:05:13,246 --> 00:05:14,947
I have a question to ask you.

127
00:05:14,947 --> 00:05:15,782
Brandon?

128
00:05:16,749 --> 00:05:17,583
- It's okay.

129
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:19,185
Brandon, calm down.

130
00:05:20,053 --> 00:05:20,887
- Okay.

131
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:24,290
Here it goes.

132
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:26,526
Some of my friends and I are going

133
00:05:26,526 --> 00:05:28,995
to this little cabin I have on the river,

134
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:33,399
and I wanted to know if
you wanted to go with us?

135
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:34,233
- Brandon.

136
00:05:36,135 --> 00:05:37,837
We hardly know each other.

137
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:38,671
- Oh, come on Tracy.

138
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:41,207
We've worked together for over a year.

139
00:05:41,207 --> 00:05:43,309
Remember the Christmas party?

140
00:05:43,309 --> 00:05:47,447
(slow-paced techno music)
(laughing)

141
00:05:47,447 --> 00:05:48,648
- Stop it.

142
00:05:48,648 --> 00:05:49,482
- Santa?

143
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:52,618
- That was you?

144
00:05:52,618 --> 00:05:53,453
- Yeah.

145
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,955
(laughing)

146
00:05:55,955 --> 00:05:58,057
- (sighing) Well, either way,
Brandon, I have a boyfriend.

147
00:05:58,057 --> 00:05:58,991
But thank you.

148
00:05:58,991 --> 00:06:00,526
- I heard you guys broke up.

149
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:01,394
- Oh, really?

150
00:06:01,394 --> 00:06:02,628
Where did you hear that?

151
00:06:02,628 --> 00:06:04,297
- It was posted on the billboard at work.

152
00:06:04,297 --> 00:06:05,131
- Oh really?

153
00:06:05,131 --> 00:06:06,366
- Oh really.

154
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:08,534
- I must have missed that.

155
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:12,205
- No, honestly, someone told
me that you were available.

156
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:15,808
So I figured, what the
hell, take a chance.

157
00:06:15,808 --> 00:06:19,712
I certainly didn't mean
to put you on the spot.

158
00:06:22,181 --> 00:06:23,483
What?

159
00:06:23,483 --> 00:06:25,818
- Nothing, it's just that-

160
00:06:25,818 --> 00:06:27,653
(suspenseful music)

161
00:06:27,653 --> 00:06:28,488
(gasping)

162
00:06:28,488 --> 00:06:30,256
(bouncy music)

163
00:06:30,256 --> 00:06:31,491
Scott and I actually have decided

164
00:06:31,491 --> 00:06:33,226
to give each other some space.

165
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:35,161
- Space? Space is good.

166
00:06:36,295 --> 00:06:37,730
So you're going to come then.

167
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:38,831
- Where's this place again?

168
00:06:38,831 --> 00:06:40,333
- It's a little place up by the river.

169
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:41,701
My parents used to own it.

170
00:06:41,701 --> 00:06:42,902
I used to go there when I was a kid.

171
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:43,936
- What'd you guys do up there?

172
00:06:43,936 --> 00:06:45,738
- Well, after the pagan orgy,

173
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:48,941
I feed everybody to a
monster in the woods.

174
00:06:48,941 --> 00:06:50,910
- So is there going to be any gin

175
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:53,413
at this pagan monster orgy?

176
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:55,314
- All the gin that you can drink.

177
00:06:55,314 --> 00:06:57,183
Let me give you my address.

178
00:06:57,183 --> 00:06:58,017
- Brandon.

179
00:06:58,017 --> 00:06:59,585
I know where you live.

180
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:00,686
- How do you know where I live?

181
00:07:00,686 --> 00:07:01,687
- Your costume party?

182
00:07:01,687 --> 00:07:02,522
Halloween?

183
00:07:02,522 --> 00:07:05,191
I came with Stephanie, remember?

184
00:07:05,191 --> 00:07:07,260
(middle eastern music)

185
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,094
Yeah?

186
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:09,328
- So hard for me to drink with the teeth.

187
00:07:09,328 --> 00:07:11,130
Wait a minute, what was your name?

188
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:12,231
That was you?

189
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:21,007
- See you around 5:45.

190
00:07:21,007 --> 00:07:22,041
Maybe.

191
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:22,875
- Maybe?

192
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:25,111
- Maybe.

193
00:07:27,246 --> 00:07:29,816
(upbeat music)

194
00:07:35,688 --> 00:07:38,191
(car beeping)

195
00:07:41,227 --> 00:07:43,796
(upbeat music)

196
00:08:01,447 --> 00:08:04,617
(suspenseful humming)

197
00:08:13,226 --> 00:08:16,496
(suspenseful humming)

198
00:08:34,547 --> 00:08:36,782
(grunting)

199
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:51,030
(chuckling)

200
00:08:53,165 --> 00:08:55,501
- Hey man, it's getting late.

201
00:08:55,501 --> 00:08:56,836
Where is this Tracy?

202
00:08:56,836 --> 00:08:59,605
- Well, she's got two minutes.

203
00:08:59,605 --> 00:09:01,173
I guess she bailed.

204
00:09:03,809 --> 00:09:05,311
- Let's get going.

205
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,114
- Okay.

206
00:09:12,852 --> 00:09:15,521
(calming music)

207
00:09:24,664 --> 00:09:25,765
Watch out.
(door slamming)

208
00:09:25,765 --> 00:09:26,766
All right.

209
00:09:26,766 --> 00:09:29,201
Away we go.
(horn honking)

210
00:09:29,201 --> 00:09:30,036
Hey.

211
00:09:31,304 --> 00:09:35,374
You guys, she's here. (laughing)

212
00:09:39,812 --> 00:09:40,713
- Hey.

213
00:09:40,713 --> 00:09:42,682
- Hey, what are you kidding me?

214
00:09:42,682 --> 00:09:43,549
(laughing)

215
00:09:43,549 --> 00:09:45,217
Oh, I am so glad you showed up.

216
00:09:45,217 --> 00:09:46,319
- Oh, am I late?

217
00:09:46,319 --> 00:09:47,153
- No.

218
00:09:47,153 --> 00:09:48,187
Hey Mark.

219
00:09:48,187 --> 00:09:49,522
Kick him to the back.

220
00:09:49,522 --> 00:09:50,356
- Okay.

221
00:09:50,356 --> 00:09:51,524
- And I will put this in the car.

222
00:09:51,524 --> 00:09:52,625
- All right.

223
00:10:01,834 --> 00:10:03,235
- And away we go.

224
00:10:09,976 --> 00:10:12,778
(energetic music)

225
00:10:34,266 --> 00:10:37,169
(eagle screeching)

226
00:10:39,672 --> 00:10:42,174
(dog barking)

227
00:10:48,414 --> 00:10:50,916
(dog barking)

228
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:10,069
(doors slamming)

229
00:11:10,069 --> 00:11:13,239
You guys are going to love this place.

230
00:11:15,207 --> 00:11:18,944
(relaxing bar music)

231
00:11:18,944 --> 00:11:20,112
- There it is.

232
00:11:23,582 --> 00:11:24,750
- Beer?
- Beer?

233
00:11:35,161 --> 00:11:35,995
- Dude.

234
00:11:35,995 --> 00:11:36,829
- Yeah?

235
00:11:36,829 --> 00:11:37,663
- Your wife is hot.

236
00:11:37,663 --> 00:11:38,664
- Isn't she?

237
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:44,970
- Mmm. Well, hello.

238
00:11:46,238 --> 00:11:47,473
My name's Sophia.

239
00:11:47,473 --> 00:11:48,574
What's yours?

240
00:11:50,242 --> 00:11:51,077
- Mark.

241
00:11:52,445 --> 00:11:54,714
And this is Brandon.

242
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:56,682
- Well hello, Mark and Brandon.

243
00:11:56,682 --> 00:11:58,017
- Are you our waitress?

244
00:11:58,017 --> 00:11:59,118
- No but, uh,

245
00:12:00,119 --> 00:12:02,955
I can satisfy any of your hungers.

246
00:12:05,124 --> 00:12:07,693
(upbeat music)

247
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:13,666
(laughing)

248
00:12:15,601 --> 00:12:16,802
- Excuse me.

249
00:12:16,802 --> 00:12:18,471
You're sitting in my seat.

250
00:12:18,471 --> 00:12:20,473
- Tracy, this is Sophia.

251
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:24,176
Sophia, this is Tracy.

252
00:12:24,176 --> 00:12:26,712
She is my date for the weekend.

253
00:12:26,712 --> 00:12:27,880
- Hm. Hi boys.

254
00:12:29,648 --> 00:12:32,351
Well, if y'all get bored with the weekend,

255
00:12:32,351 --> 00:12:34,687
y'all know where to find me.

256
00:12:36,856 --> 00:12:39,125
(laughing)

257
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:42,928
- What?
- What?

258
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:43,763
- C'mon.

259
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:45,798
- What? What was that?

260
00:12:45,798 --> 00:12:46,632
- Yeah.

261
00:12:48,367 --> 00:12:49,435
- What can I get you?

262
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:51,504
- Can we get four beers please?

263
00:12:51,504 --> 00:12:52,872
- Three beers and an ice tea.

264
00:12:52,872 --> 00:12:55,574
- Three cold ones and a tea on the rocks.

265
00:12:55,574 --> 00:12:59,411
- So Susan, how exactly
did you and Mark meet?

266
00:13:00,579 --> 00:13:01,413
(church organ music)

267
00:13:01,413 --> 00:13:05,985
(moaning)
(car squeaking)

268
00:13:05,985 --> 00:13:06,819
- Church.

269
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:09,188
- You jerk.

270
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:12,458
- [Tracy] Oh that poor girl.

271
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,460
- She only looks about 18.

272
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:15,861
- That poor thing, she looks hurt.

273
00:13:15,861 --> 00:13:16,896
- We should go talk to her.

274
00:13:16,896 --> 00:13:18,230
- [Tracy] Yeah.

275
00:13:25,571 --> 00:13:27,206
- Can I get y'all anything else?

276
00:13:27,206 --> 00:13:28,040
- No.

277
00:13:39,218 --> 00:13:41,887
- 10 bucks says we're taking her with us.

278
00:13:41,887 --> 00:13:43,322
- No fucking way.

279
00:13:54,233 --> 00:13:55,134
- Thanks.

280
00:13:55,134 --> 00:13:56,202
I'll just stay tonight.

281
00:13:56,202 --> 00:13:59,271
I'll hit the road tomorrow.

282
00:13:59,271 --> 00:14:00,105
- Whatever

283
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:04,777
(slow-paced mysterious music)

284
00:14:04,777 --> 00:14:07,046
(laughing)

285
00:14:27,233 --> 00:14:28,133
So, Debbie.

286
00:14:29,802 --> 00:14:30,636
- Denise.

287
00:14:32,404 --> 00:14:33,472
- Denise.

288
00:14:33,472 --> 00:14:36,942
What exactly happened with
you and that guy back there?

289
00:14:36,942 --> 00:14:39,044
- You mean George?

290
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:40,546
What a sick freak.

291
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:43,916
He just picked me up hitchhiking.

292
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:45,784
I rode with him for like six hours

293
00:14:45,784 --> 00:14:48,053
when we stopped at that road house.

294
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:48,854
I was going to go soon,

295
00:14:48,854 --> 00:14:50,089
as soon as he let me off.

296
00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:53,559
But I decided to wait until I
got some food in me, you know?

297
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:56,262
He had been trying to
touch me the whole time.

298
00:14:56,262 --> 00:14:57,696
- Oh, you nasty little doublet,

299
00:14:57,696 --> 00:14:59,398
I just want you to come
back to my truck with me.

300
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:01,567
- I nearly choked.

301
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:03,869
I wanted out of there
right then, but I thought,

302
00:15:03,869 --> 00:15:05,337
where the hell am I going to go?

303
00:15:05,337 --> 00:15:06,171
(laughing)

304
00:15:06,171 --> 00:15:08,507
So I'm scarfing my food,

305
00:15:08,507 --> 00:15:12,711
looking around for a
back door or anything.

306
00:15:12,711 --> 00:15:14,580
And that's when he blurts out:

307
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,682
"I want to suck your toes."

308
00:15:16,682 --> 00:15:17,750
- Yeah, I just want to suck your toes

309
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,351
till you call me daddy.

310
00:15:19,351 --> 00:15:20,185
Daddy.

311
00:15:20,185 --> 00:15:21,020
Daddy.

312
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:21,854
- That's when I hit him.

313
00:15:21,854 --> 00:15:22,688
- Jerk.

314
00:15:22,688 --> 00:15:26,292
(suspenseful music)

315
00:15:26,292 --> 00:15:28,227
Thank God you guys were there.

316
00:15:28,227 --> 00:15:29,862
- He wanted to suck your toes?

317
00:15:29,862 --> 00:15:30,696
- Yeah.

318
00:15:30,696 --> 00:15:32,464
He wanted to suck my toes.

319
00:15:32,464 --> 00:15:33,699
- Men are pigs.

320
00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:34,533
- [Susan] Really.

321
00:15:34,533 --> 00:15:35,367
(laughing)

322
00:15:35,367 --> 00:15:36,235
- Easy now ladies.

323
00:15:36,235 --> 00:15:37,169
Hey, I may be a pig,

324
00:15:37,169 --> 00:15:39,338
but I've never wanted
to suck anyone's toes.

325
00:15:39,338 --> 00:15:41,941
- I just hope that sick
freak didn't follow us.

326
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:43,075
- What do you mean?

327
00:15:43,075 --> 00:15:45,678
- When I got to Biloxi, and
you know, he picked me up.

328
00:15:45,678 --> 00:15:48,414
I started to remember seeing him.

329
00:15:48,414 --> 00:15:51,216
I kept asking him, you
know, where he was headed

330
00:15:51,216 --> 00:15:53,385
and can never get a straight answer.

331
00:15:53,385 --> 00:15:55,487
He just kept dodging the question.

332
00:15:55,487 --> 00:15:57,222
It was really creepy.

333
00:15:59,525 --> 00:16:02,528
(suspenseful music)

334
00:16:44,203 --> 00:16:46,772
- So Susan, how long have
you and Mark been married?

335
00:16:46,772 --> 00:16:48,374
- We've been together
about five years now.

336
00:16:48,374 --> 00:16:49,575
- [Tracy] Hey, would you put
that in the fridge for me?

337
00:16:49,575 --> 00:16:50,409
- Sure.

338
00:16:50,409 --> 00:16:51,243
- Um...

339
00:16:53,078 --> 00:16:56,348
So are you guys going to have kids?

340
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:57,983
- Mark is a kid.

341
00:16:57,983 --> 00:16:59,651
Don't get me wrong, I love him.

342
00:16:59,651 --> 00:17:03,155
But I do everything in the
morning except get him dressed.

343
00:17:03,155 --> 00:17:06,458
- Ew, my mom used to
say that about my dad.

344
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:07,459
- Mine too.

345
00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:08,994
You just don't think it's
going to happen though,

346
00:17:08,994 --> 00:17:10,496
until it's too late.

347
00:17:10,496 --> 00:17:13,298
- Would you change your mind
If you could take it back?

348
00:17:13,298 --> 00:17:15,067
- I never thought of it like that.

349
00:17:15,067 --> 00:17:16,568
It's a good question.

350
00:17:16,568 --> 00:17:19,138
But no, I'd marry him again.

351
00:17:19,138 --> 00:17:22,808
I love him, like I said,
but it's no picnic.

352
00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:24,943
So Tracy, how long have you

353
00:17:24,943 --> 00:17:26,745
been going out with Brandon anyway?

354
00:17:26,745 --> 00:17:29,948
- Oh, this is actually the first time.

355
00:17:29,948 --> 00:17:31,316
- Really?

356
00:17:31,316 --> 00:17:33,619
Well, how long have you known him?

357
00:17:33,619 --> 00:17:36,922
- We've known each other about a year.

358
00:17:36,922 --> 00:17:39,158
- So do you guys work together?

359
00:17:39,158 --> 00:17:42,127
- Well, we work for the same company.

360
00:17:42,127 --> 00:17:43,929
- So what do you think about him?

361
00:17:43,929 --> 00:17:45,964
- Yeah, is he good in bed?

362
00:17:45,964 --> 00:17:47,466
- I wouldn't know.

363
00:17:49,468 --> 00:17:51,303
So what about you, Denise?

364
00:17:51,303 --> 00:17:52,638
- How about what?

365
00:17:52,638 --> 00:17:54,473
- Do you have a boyfriend?

366
00:17:54,473 --> 00:17:55,974
- Not anymore.

367
00:17:55,974 --> 00:17:57,943
- What happened?

368
00:17:57,943 --> 00:17:59,978
- Have you ever had the feeling
that the guys you're with,

369
00:17:59,978 --> 00:18:02,414
just really didn't give a shit about you?

370
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:03,482
- Yes.
- Yes.

371
00:18:10,989 --> 00:18:13,826
(drinks clinking)

372
00:18:20,899 --> 00:18:21,733
- Thanks.

373
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:27,706
- Here you go.

374
00:18:27,706 --> 00:18:28,540
- Thanks.

375
00:18:30,342 --> 00:18:31,176
- Thanks.

376
00:18:32,344 --> 00:18:33,812
- So Tracy, do you smoke pot?

377
00:18:33,812 --> 00:18:37,616
- Oh, I used to in college,
but I mean not much anymore.

378
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:41,386
- I love getting high, but
I can't roll worth a shit.

379
00:18:41,386 --> 00:18:43,422
- Don't worry, I've got you covered.

380
00:18:43,422 --> 00:18:44,957
- That's what I love about you, baby.

381
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:47,059
You've got your priorities straight.

382
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:48,393
- Damn straight.

383
00:18:51,497 --> 00:18:54,566
- Hey, have you guys heard the ghost story

384
00:18:54,566 --> 00:18:56,735
about the wife who tells her husband

385
00:18:56,735 --> 00:18:59,204
never to take off her scarf?

386
00:18:59,204 --> 00:19:00,038
- Oh please.

387
00:19:00,038 --> 00:19:01,006
Not that one.

388
00:19:01,006 --> 00:19:02,708
- That's an old one.

389
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:03,642
- Well fuck, Mark,

390
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:06,678
why don't you tell a ghost story?

391
00:19:06,678 --> 00:19:07,946
- No fucking way, Mark.

392
00:19:07,946 --> 00:19:08,780
Don't.

393
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:09,615
- Oh, come on.

394
00:19:09,615 --> 00:19:10,449
I want to hear one.

395
00:19:10,449 --> 00:19:11,283
No, you don't.

396
00:19:11,283 --> 00:19:12,117
Trust me.

397
00:19:12,117 --> 00:19:13,585
- There's the one about

398
00:19:13,585 --> 00:19:16,455
the four people that went
to a cabin in the woods.

399
00:19:16,455 --> 00:19:18,323
(laughing)

400
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:19,658
- Oh, geez.

401
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:21,527
- Oh man, that's horrible.
- God.

402
00:19:21,527 --> 00:19:23,061
- Hey, hey, hey.

403
00:19:23,061 --> 00:19:25,531
There is the one about the insane maniac

404
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:27,933
that escapes from an asylum

405
00:19:27,933 --> 00:19:29,401
on the same weekend that

406
00:19:29,401 --> 00:19:32,404
this high school couple
is on their first date.

407
00:19:32,404 --> 00:19:33,238
- Oh my gosh, yeah,

408
00:19:33,238 --> 00:19:34,573
and his hand gets caught in the door.

409
00:19:34,573 --> 00:19:37,176
And then when, it's just
a hook hanging there.

410
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:38,010
- You've heard it?

411
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:39,044
- Yeah.

412
00:19:39,044 --> 00:19:41,446
- I think we've all heard it.

413
00:19:41,446 --> 00:19:43,081
- [Denise] Well, I don't have a story,

414
00:19:43,081 --> 00:19:46,952
but I have a great idea
for a horror movie.

415
00:19:46,952 --> 00:19:50,923
- Like Friday the 13th or like Scream?

416
00:19:50,923 --> 00:19:52,324
- Friday the 13th.

417
00:19:52,324 --> 00:19:53,425
Definitely.

418
00:19:53,425 --> 00:19:54,259
- Tell it.

419
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:56,395
- Okay.

420
00:19:56,395 --> 00:19:57,296
It's about a clown.

421
00:19:57,296 --> 00:19:58,163
(nursery music)

422
00:19:58,163 --> 00:20:01,500
(whimpering and crying)

423
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:03,869
- Oh no, no, no, no, no.

424
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:05,571
I hate clowns.

425
00:20:05,571 --> 00:20:07,339
I hate them.

426
00:20:07,339 --> 00:20:10,976
Fuck it, I'm going to get more beer.

427
00:20:10,976 --> 00:20:12,344
- Anyways.

428
00:20:12,344 --> 00:20:14,379
There's a small town where
kids are disappearing.

429
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:16,682
Little kids, like five and six years old.

430
00:20:16,682 --> 00:20:19,818
(child laughing)
(woman shivering)

431
00:20:19,818 --> 00:20:22,087
People were freaking out.

432
00:20:22,087 --> 00:20:24,189
The whole area is on alert.

433
00:20:24,189 --> 00:20:26,258
And there's this guy
who lives by the river.

434
00:20:26,258 --> 00:20:28,527
He's a big guy, like 350 pounds.

435
00:20:28,527 --> 00:20:29,861
And he's a real loner.

436
00:20:29,861 --> 00:20:31,330
Keeps to himself mostly.

437
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:33,532
And you know, he doesn't
really bother anyone.

438
00:20:33,532 --> 00:20:34,866
He does charity work at the hospital.

439
00:20:34,866 --> 00:20:35,767
- Charity work?

440
00:20:35,767 --> 00:20:36,602
- Yeah.

441
00:20:36,602 --> 00:20:38,804
He visits sick kids and
dresses up like a clown.

442
00:20:38,804 --> 00:20:41,106
- Oh, I know where this is going.

443
00:20:41,106 --> 00:20:41,940
- Yeah.

444
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:42,774
Anyways,

445
00:20:42,774 --> 00:20:44,476
so one day this rich couple whose kid

446
00:20:44,476 --> 00:20:46,078
has been sick in the hospital,

447
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:47,312
ask the clown to come and entertain

448
00:20:47,312 --> 00:20:48,947
at her fifth birthday party.

449
00:20:48,947 --> 00:20:51,483
So he comes in his clown
outfit, does his thing.

450
00:20:51,483 --> 00:20:53,685
Everybody loves him and he leaves.

451
00:20:53,685 --> 00:20:56,321
But that night he comes back
to the little girl's window

452
00:20:56,321 --> 00:20:57,956
and gets her to open it.

453
00:20:57,956 --> 00:21:01,460
Her parents find her room
empty the next morning.

454
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:02,661
- I knew it.

455
00:21:02,661 --> 00:21:03,495
- Yeah.

456
00:21:03,495 --> 00:21:05,430
Well then the cops find a giant shoe print

457
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:07,032
near the little girl's
window the next day.

458
00:21:07,032 --> 00:21:07,966
- Oh geeze.

459
00:21:10,869 --> 00:21:12,571
- [Denise] So the cops,
thinking it's the clown,

460
00:21:12,571 --> 00:21:14,239
takes him in for questioning.

461
00:21:14,239 --> 00:21:15,540
- This is a fucked up movie.

462
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:16,375
- Yeah.

463
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:17,976
Although the guy was there during the day,

464
00:21:17,976 --> 00:21:19,711
they can't convict him.

465
00:21:19,711 --> 00:21:21,546
So they have to let him go,

466
00:21:21,546 --> 00:21:23,348
even though they knew he did it.

467
00:21:23,348 --> 00:21:24,583
- That sucks.

468
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:25,417
- Yeah.

469
00:21:25,417 --> 00:21:27,119
The parents were pissed.

470
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:29,121
The father puts together
this little posse,

471
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:31,556
they go to the dude's
house, and they get him.

472
00:21:31,556 --> 00:21:32,791
- What do they do to him?

473
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:34,459
- They take him out to the woods.

474
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:37,763
- Come on. (men talking)

475
00:21:37,763 --> 00:21:38,964
- Tie him to a tree.

476
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:40,198
- Get up there.

477
00:21:43,368 --> 00:21:45,437
- And they beat him to death.

478
00:21:45,437 --> 00:21:50,275
(groaning)
(loud ringing)

479
00:21:52,444 --> 00:21:54,880
- You want to be a clown?

480
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,015
(bones crunching)

481
00:21:57,015 --> 00:22:00,352
(nursery music)
(loud ringing)

482
00:22:00,352 --> 00:22:01,286
(sighing)

483
00:22:01,286 --> 00:22:02,454
- End of movie?

484
00:22:02,454 --> 00:22:03,488
- No.

485
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:07,459
One of the posse can't live
with the guilt, and confesses.

486
00:22:07,459 --> 00:22:09,695
- Okay, lead the way.

487
00:22:09,695 --> 00:22:11,496
- He takes the cops to the tree.

488
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:12,798
- He's right here, he's on this tree.

489
00:22:12,798 --> 00:22:14,533
It's this one here.

490
00:22:14,533 --> 00:22:16,835
(groaning)

491
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:19,137
- But there's nothing there.

492
00:22:19,137 --> 00:22:21,640
- What do you mean there's nothing there?

493
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,375
- There's no one there.

494
00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:24,209
- Yeah, right.

495
00:22:24,209 --> 00:22:25,010
- Hey, where you going?

496
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:26,011
I'm not lying, he was here.

497
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:28,880
We gotta do something, he was here.

498
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,582
- So the cops go to the clown's house,

499
00:22:30,582 --> 00:22:32,150
looking for a sign of struggle.

500
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:33,118
- Nothing again, right?

501
00:22:33,118 --> 00:22:34,653
This story sucks.

502
00:22:34,653 --> 00:22:36,154
- Well, it's just an idea.

503
00:22:36,154 --> 00:22:38,957
- The girl's father could
have hidden her body

504
00:22:38,957 --> 00:22:40,058
to cover the crime.

505
00:22:40,058 --> 00:22:41,560
- Oh, right.

506
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,662
The cops could go to the parents house.

507
00:22:43,662 --> 00:22:46,131
- And they could find the parents dead.

508
00:22:46,131 --> 00:22:48,133
Whoever killed them tied them to chairs,

509
00:22:48,133 --> 00:22:51,269
sat them down at the kitchen
table, and fed them dinner.

510
00:22:51,269 --> 00:22:52,571
- [Susan] Fed them dinner?

511
00:22:52,571 --> 00:22:54,005
- Yeah.

512
00:22:54,005 --> 00:22:56,942
The clown could feed the
little girl to her parents.

513
00:23:20,298 --> 00:23:22,634
(everyone groaning)

514
00:23:22,634 --> 00:23:23,902
- Oh my God.

515
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:26,772
- The cops could find the
little girl in the kitchen,

516
00:23:26,772 --> 00:23:29,007
gutted like an animal, and roasted.

517
00:23:29,007 --> 00:23:30,675
(laughing)

518
00:23:30,675 --> 00:23:32,911
The clown fed them their little girl.

519
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:35,347
- That's the most disgusting
thing I've ever heard.

520
00:23:35,347 --> 00:23:36,548
(laughing)

521
00:23:36,548 --> 00:23:37,582
(suspenseful music)

522
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:38,850
- Ah, Jesus Chr-

523
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:41,186
You're an asshole, I'm out of here.

524
00:23:41,186 --> 00:23:42,621
- Nice one.

525
00:23:42,621 --> 00:23:44,356
- [Brandon] Oh, shit.

526
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:48,193
- Run to her, Romeo.

527
00:23:48,193 --> 00:23:50,028
Do you guys wanna hear
the rest of the movie?

528
00:23:50,028 --> 00:23:50,862
- No.

529
00:23:50,862 --> 00:23:51,696
- No more.

530
00:23:51,696 --> 00:23:52,531
- What?

531
00:23:52,531 --> 00:23:54,032
The scary part's next.

532
00:23:54,032 --> 00:23:55,700
But I've got to pee.

533
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:01,239
- Tracy, I'm sorry.

534
00:24:01,239 --> 00:24:03,442
I shouldn't have scared you like that.

535
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:04,543
- No, it's okay.

536
00:24:04,543 --> 00:24:07,646
I should probably be able to take it.

537
00:24:08,914 --> 00:24:12,117
God, I probably look
pretty ridiculous, huh?

538
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:12,951
- No, no.

539
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:14,586
If anybody looks ridiculous,

540
00:24:14,586 --> 00:24:17,489
(sighing) it's me.

541
00:24:20,158 --> 00:24:21,393
Look, I promise you.

542
00:24:21,393 --> 00:24:22,260
I give you my word.

543
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:24,029
I am not going to play any more games

544
00:24:24,029 --> 00:24:26,465
for the rest of this weekend.

545
00:24:28,099 --> 00:24:29,401
But on Monday,

546
00:24:29,401 --> 00:24:31,169
all bets are off.

547
00:24:31,169 --> 00:24:33,672
- (laughing) Thanks.

548
00:24:33,672 --> 00:24:36,575
I guess I'm just a little nervous.

549
00:24:36,575 --> 00:24:40,612
- Hey, not to change
the subject or anything,

550
00:24:40,612 --> 00:24:42,948
but can you tell me how in the hell

551
00:24:42,948 --> 00:24:44,883
I can work with you for a year

552
00:24:44,883 --> 00:24:47,819
and not ask you out on a date?

553
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:49,554
- Oh, here we go.

554
00:24:49,554 --> 00:24:50,922
- What?

555
00:24:50,922 --> 00:24:55,727
- Oh, the old Brandon Walker
charm I've heard so much about.

556
00:24:55,727 --> 00:24:59,164
You have no idea how
much women talk, do you?

557
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:01,299
Do you realize that I've heard about you

558
00:25:01,299 --> 00:25:03,735
from several other coworkers?

559
00:25:04,636 --> 00:25:06,905
(laughing)

560
00:25:08,373 --> 00:25:09,708
What?

561
00:25:09,708 --> 00:25:12,310
- You know what your problem is, baby?

562
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:13,245
- No.

563
00:25:13,245 --> 00:25:14,779
- You're tense.

564
00:25:14,779 --> 00:25:16,281
- No I'm not.

565
00:25:16,281 --> 00:25:17,215
- Too tense.

566
00:25:17,215 --> 00:25:18,750
Come here.

567
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:19,751
- What are you doing?

568
00:25:19,751 --> 00:25:21,987
- I'm going to give you a back rub.

569
00:25:21,987 --> 00:25:23,088
Oh, that's...

570
00:25:24,122 --> 00:25:26,324
I'm going to give you
a massage, first class.

571
00:25:26,324 --> 00:25:28,493
(laughing)

572
00:25:28,493 --> 00:25:32,130
- So why did you guys bring
this Denise chick along?

573
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:33,765
- You got a problem with it?

574
00:25:33,765 --> 00:25:35,400
- Maybe.

575
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,935
- I'll bet you do.

576
00:25:36,935 --> 00:25:38,470
- And what does that mean?

577
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:39,638
- What does that mean?

578
00:25:39,638 --> 00:25:41,373
- You brought her.

579
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:42,941
- It was Tracy's idea.

580
00:25:42,941 --> 00:25:44,809
- Oh yeah? (laughing)

581
00:25:44,809 --> 00:25:45,977
- Well we couldn't just leave her there.

582
00:25:45,977 --> 00:25:47,612
She's a kid, you know?

583
00:25:47,612 --> 00:25:50,849
- She seems pretty grown up to me.

584
00:25:50,849 --> 00:25:52,617
- Oh she does, does she?

585
00:25:52,617 --> 00:25:53,585
- Fuck yes.

586
00:25:53,585 --> 00:25:55,487
She's got it going on.

587
00:25:55,487 --> 00:25:57,756
- "She's got it going on," does she?

588
00:25:57,756 --> 00:25:58,757
(laughing)

589
00:25:58,757 --> 00:26:01,092
- What are you, a fucking parent?

590
00:26:01,092 --> 00:26:03,528
(laughing)

591
00:26:03,528 --> 00:26:04,396
- Oh.

592
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:05,564
- And finally,

593
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:09,634
this last region of nervousness

594
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:14,039
is just about gone.

595
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:18,310
(moaning)

596
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:22,147
Of course we will have
to continue this later.

597
00:26:24,182 --> 00:26:26,518
You want to go back outside?

598
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:28,787
- They're adults.

599
00:26:28,787 --> 00:26:31,923
Why don't we let them fend for themselves?

600
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:32,924
- Oh, Tracy.

601
00:26:34,893 --> 00:26:37,228
I do like the way you think.

602
00:26:50,542 --> 00:26:52,444
(suspenseful music)

603
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:55,347
- So baby, how long
have you known Brandon?

604
00:26:55,347 --> 00:26:57,315
- We went to school together.

605
00:26:57,315 --> 00:26:59,451
A pretty long damn time, I guess.

606
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:02,621
- I've never heard you
talk about him before.

607
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:03,555
- I hadn't really thought about him

608
00:27:03,555 --> 00:27:06,224
since we graduated from college.

609
00:27:08,927 --> 00:27:11,429
- So you weren't that close?

610
00:27:11,429 --> 00:27:13,498
- We played ball together.

611
00:27:13,498 --> 00:27:15,400
I knew him pretty well, I suppose.

612
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:18,236
As well as I knew anybody.

613
00:27:18,236 --> 00:27:19,804
Man, he sure fucked up with Tracy.

614
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:22,807
(laughing)

615
00:27:22,807 --> 00:27:24,609
- I don't know about that, baby.

616
00:27:24,609 --> 00:27:26,611
- What do you mean?

617
00:27:26,611 --> 00:27:28,546
- Well, where are they?

618
00:27:31,216 --> 00:27:33,885
(calming music)

619
00:28:00,412 --> 00:28:04,816
- So what you're saying is that
they are in there right now

620
00:28:04,816 --> 00:28:06,651
on top of each other?

621
00:28:06,651 --> 00:28:08,787
- I don't know about that.

622
00:28:08,787 --> 00:28:10,388
- That's what you said.

623
00:28:10,388 --> 00:28:12,957
- That's not what I said.

624
00:28:12,957 --> 00:28:15,794
(suspenseful music)

625
00:28:15,794 --> 00:28:17,862
This is a getting-to-know-you trip anyway.

626
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:19,364
- Getting-to-know-you?

627
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:20,999
(laughing)

628
00:28:20,999 --> 00:28:22,967
That's ridiculous.

629
00:28:22,967 --> 00:28:25,704
She's obligated to have sex with him now.

630
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:33,812
- That's not going to work, Mark.

631
00:28:33,812 --> 00:28:34,879
- What?

632
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:36,881
- Trying to piss me off.

633
00:28:37,782 --> 00:28:38,783
- All right.

634
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:43,888
I just wanted to see if I
can get a rise out of you.

635
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:45,623
Hey, I have an idea.

636
00:28:45,623 --> 00:28:46,458
- What?

637
00:28:46,458 --> 00:28:49,227
- Let's go inside and see if
you can get a rise out of me.

638
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:51,730
(laughing)

639
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:53,465
- Lead the way, stud.

640
00:28:54,499 --> 00:28:56,701
- Where did what's-her-name go?

641
00:28:56,701 --> 00:28:57,635
- Denise?

642
00:28:57,635 --> 00:28:58,470
- Yeah.

643
00:28:59,537 --> 00:29:01,506
- I don't know, she's probably sleeping.

644
00:29:01,506 --> 00:29:03,508
I'm freezing. C'mon, Let's go.

645
00:29:03,508 --> 00:29:04,342
- Okay.

646
00:29:11,683 --> 00:29:13,918
(laughing)

647
00:29:16,121 --> 00:29:16,955
- Okay.

648
00:29:18,123 --> 00:29:18,957
Okay.

649
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:25,163
(laughing)

650
00:29:26,798 --> 00:29:28,633
- You silly guy, stop.

651
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:34,339
(laughing)

652
00:29:35,974 --> 00:29:38,643
(nursery music)

653
00:29:41,846 --> 00:29:44,616
(floor creaking)

654
00:29:53,491 --> 00:29:55,760
(suspenseful tone)
(yelping)

655
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,262
- Thirsty? Me too.

656
00:29:58,563 --> 00:29:59,564
Do you mind?

657
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:09,374
Hey Tracy?

658
00:30:09,374 --> 00:30:11,042
- [Tracy] Yeah?

659
00:30:11,042 --> 00:30:12,911
- Thanks for picking me up.

660
00:30:12,911 --> 00:30:15,213
I know Brandon didn't
particularly want to.

661
00:30:15,213 --> 00:30:16,948
- [Tracy] No problem.

662
00:30:21,853 --> 00:30:24,189
(suspenseful music)

663
00:30:24,189 --> 00:30:26,424
- [Mysterious Voice] Susan?

664
00:30:51,382 --> 00:30:52,217
Susan?

665
00:30:53,418 --> 00:30:54,252
- Mark?

666
00:30:56,554 --> 00:30:58,656
Mark, did you hear that?

667
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:03,328
(sighing)

668
00:31:06,831 --> 00:31:10,001
(suspenseful music)

669
00:31:10,001 --> 00:31:12,670
(door creaking)

670
00:31:27,986 --> 00:31:30,822
(heavy breathing)

671
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:38,897
(floor creaking)

672
00:31:48,773 --> 00:31:52,043
(music growing louder)

673
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:58,483
(muffled screaming)

674
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:13,998
(dramatic tone)

675
00:32:13,998 --> 00:32:17,168
- Whoa, you scared the shit out of me.

676
00:32:18,303 --> 00:32:20,738
What are you doing up?

677
00:32:20,738 --> 00:32:22,941
- Couldn't sleep.

678
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:24,108
Got a problem?

679
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:26,144
- Sorry.

680
00:32:28,112 --> 00:32:29,681
- Want a cigarette?

681
00:32:30,815 --> 00:32:31,649
- Sure.

682
00:32:38,423 --> 00:32:40,825
- So where's what's-her-name?

683
00:32:41,826 --> 00:32:44,529
- What's-her-name is asleep.

684
00:32:44,529 --> 00:32:48,166
(muffled screaming)

685
00:32:48,166 --> 00:32:49,434
(suspenseful music)

686
00:32:49,434 --> 00:32:50,535
- What was that?

687
00:32:50,535 --> 00:32:51,769
- I don't know.

688
00:32:51,769 --> 00:32:53,538
I'll go check it out.

689
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,015
(laughing) No, no, no, no, no.

690
00:33:04,015 --> 00:33:06,117
I can't do this.

691
00:33:06,117 --> 00:33:07,685
- It's a secret.

692
00:33:07,685 --> 00:33:10,621
Come on Brandon, don't you want me?

693
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:15,093
Nobody has to know.

694
00:33:23,901 --> 00:33:27,138
(energetic rock music)

695
00:34:31,836 --> 00:34:34,806
Tomorrow is no different,
do you understand?

696
00:34:37,108 --> 00:34:38,843
(kissing)

697
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:46,317
(dramatic organ music)

698
00:34:52,990 --> 00:34:54,358
(organ music stops)

699
00:34:59,597 --> 00:35:01,766
(yawning)

700
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:04,769
- Good morning. How'd you sleep?

701
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:05,736
- Oh, great.

702
00:35:05,736 --> 00:35:08,673
It is so good to be away from the city.

703
00:35:08,673 --> 00:35:09,607
- City?

704
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:12,610
We're 12 miles away from civilization.

705
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:14,612
You guys want breakfast?

706
00:35:18,983 --> 00:35:20,551
How about pancakes?

707
00:35:22,753 --> 00:35:25,022
- [Mark] What else you got?

708
00:35:25,923 --> 00:35:28,092
(yawning)

709
00:35:30,361 --> 00:35:33,131
- We brought some eggs and juice.

710
00:35:36,901 --> 00:35:40,538
(suspenseful music)

711
00:35:40,538 --> 00:35:43,141
Brandon, what the fuck is this?

712
00:35:45,376 --> 00:35:47,245
- [Denise] What the hell?

713
00:35:47,245 --> 00:35:48,579
- What the fuck?

714
00:35:51,015 --> 00:35:54,652
- You tell us Brandon, it's your house.

715
00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:56,754
- You will regret this.

716
00:35:56,754 --> 00:35:59,357
- What does that mean?

717
00:35:59,357 --> 00:36:01,292
- Tell us this is your idea of a joke.

718
00:36:01,292 --> 00:36:02,126
- Me?

719
00:36:02,126 --> 00:36:03,161
- Like I said, it's your house.

720
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:05,496
- Dude, I have no idea what this is about.

721
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:06,931
- Then who the hell does?

722
00:36:06,931 --> 00:36:08,733
- Yeah, if you didn't do it, who did?

723
00:36:08,733 --> 00:36:10,368
- This is not funny.

724
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:12,003
- It's kind of funny.

725
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:13,504
- No, it is not.

726
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:16,040
- Come on, Mark, this
is right up your alley.

727
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,542
Tell us you did this.

728
00:36:17,542 --> 00:36:19,377
- This isn't fucking
funny, and I didn't do it.

729
00:36:19,377 --> 00:36:21,913
- Denise, did you do this? Be honest.

730
00:36:21,913 --> 00:36:24,982
- I didn't do it, but I knew who did.

731
00:36:25,883 --> 00:36:26,717
- Who?

732
00:36:26,717 --> 00:36:28,386
- It must be George.

733
00:36:28,386 --> 00:36:30,555
That's sick toe-sucking
freak followed us up here,

734
00:36:30,555 --> 00:36:32,223
I just know it.

735
00:36:32,223 --> 00:36:35,660
- I guess sex on the first date is out.

736
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:37,562
- I've had enough.

737
00:36:37,562 --> 00:36:40,431
- Oh, come on Tracy, wait a minute.

738
00:36:40,431 --> 00:36:42,166
- Wait, where's Susan?

739
00:36:42,166 --> 00:36:45,303
- She's probably recovering
from your giant dick.

740
00:36:45,303 --> 00:36:46,971
(sighing)

741
00:36:46,971 --> 00:36:49,207
I know it'd take me a week.

742
00:36:55,112 --> 00:36:57,281
- [Brandon] Tracy, what are you doing?

743
00:36:57,281 --> 00:36:58,482
Why are you freaking out?

744
00:36:58,482 --> 00:36:59,317
- Look Brandon.

745
00:36:59,317 --> 00:37:00,451
I don't know what's going on here,

746
00:37:00,451 --> 00:37:01,619
but I'm not about to stay in a house

747
00:37:01,619 --> 00:37:03,521
where somebody thinks that
this kind of shit is funny.

748
00:37:03,521 --> 00:37:06,657
I'm scared, and I want to go home now.

749
00:37:06,657 --> 00:37:08,759
- Brandon, Tracy, I can't find Susan.

750
00:37:08,759 --> 00:37:12,163
Do you guys have any
idea where she might be?

751
00:37:12,163 --> 00:37:15,166
(suspenseful music)

752
00:37:16,767 --> 00:37:18,369
- Maybe the boogeyman got her.

753
00:37:18,369 --> 00:37:19,203
Woo.

754
00:37:19,203 --> 00:37:21,939
- Don't fuck with me, understand?

755
00:37:28,145 --> 00:37:28,980
- Look, Brandon.

756
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:31,649
I want you to get in that
car and take me home now.

757
00:37:31,649 --> 00:37:35,152
- Okay? I just think you're overreacting.

758
00:37:35,152 --> 00:37:37,288
- We need to find my wife now.

759
00:37:37,288 --> 00:37:38,322
- Okay, Mark.

760
00:37:38,322 --> 00:37:40,124
Now what's wrong?

761
00:37:40,124 --> 00:37:42,526
- This is what's wrong.

762
00:37:42,526 --> 00:37:44,228
- [Denise] She's walking.

763
00:37:44,228 --> 00:37:45,062
- What?

764
00:37:45,062 --> 00:37:47,064
- She got up early and
she went for a walk.

765
00:37:47,064 --> 00:37:49,567
I saw her go toward the river.

766
00:37:51,902 --> 00:37:54,205
- You guys, we've got like
a thousand acres of woods

767
00:37:54,205 --> 00:37:55,873
and if she's lost...

768
00:37:57,341 --> 00:38:00,211
Look Tracy, can we look for Susan first?

769
00:38:00,211 --> 00:38:03,948
And then I promise you,
I will take you home.

770
00:38:05,483 --> 00:38:08,319
- (sighing) Fine.

771
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:14,125
(suspenseful music)

772
00:38:30,875 --> 00:38:33,511
- She's been gone for at least an hour.

773
00:38:33,511 --> 00:38:34,378
- Okay, Mark.

774
00:38:34,378 --> 00:38:38,416
I'm sure she went out exploring
and she probably got lost.

775
00:38:38,416 --> 00:38:39,784
- Thanks.

776
00:38:39,784 --> 00:38:42,086
(screaming)

777
00:38:43,888 --> 00:38:45,890
- What the hell was that?

778
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:49,393
- Look, everybody just stay calm.

779
00:38:49,393 --> 00:38:51,162
- What the fuck was that?

780
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:53,664
Have you ever heard anything like that?

781
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:55,232
- Never.

782
00:38:55,232 --> 00:38:56,667
Tracy?

783
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:58,336
Let's go find Susan.

784
00:38:59,203 --> 00:39:00,037
- Oh, that's okay.

785
00:39:00,037 --> 00:39:01,639
You guys go ahead, I'm going to stay here.

786
00:39:01,639 --> 00:39:03,040
- I'd like it if you go with us.

787
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:05,209
- I don't want to.

788
00:39:05,209 --> 00:39:07,511
- Well, you may be able
to be of some help.

789
00:39:07,511 --> 00:39:08,713
- Look, Brandon, I don't like the woods.

790
00:39:08,713 --> 00:39:09,914
I'd rather not, okay?

791
00:39:09,914 --> 00:39:11,782
- I would appreciate it if you would go.

792
00:39:11,782 --> 00:39:13,050
- Well I feel safer here.

793
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:14,318
- I have to find my wife.

794
00:39:14,318 --> 00:39:15,920
Let her stay.

795
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:19,457
(screaming and loud bang)

796
00:39:19,457 --> 00:39:20,791
- Okay, I'll go.

797
00:39:22,293 --> 00:39:25,162
- Look, let's just analyze
the situation, okay?

798
00:39:25,162 --> 00:39:27,531
Susan got up this morning early,

799
00:39:27,531 --> 00:39:29,033
and she took a walk,

800
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:30,701
and she probably got lost.

801
00:39:30,701 --> 00:39:32,770
There's plenty of places
out there to go exploring,

802
00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:35,673
and plenty of ways to get
mixed up on the trails, okay?

803
00:39:35,673 --> 00:39:37,174
It is no big deal.

804
00:39:39,243 --> 00:39:40,378
- Okay

805
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:42,380
What about the dolls in the refrigerator?

806
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:43,614
- What about them?

807
00:39:43,614 --> 00:39:45,116
- It's a unnerving, that's what.

808
00:39:45,116 --> 00:39:46,751
My wife is missing.

809
00:39:46,751 --> 00:39:48,185
We find a headless doll in the fridge,

810
00:39:48,185 --> 00:39:50,521
and now Cujo's out here in the woods.

811
00:39:50,521 --> 00:39:53,290
- Tracy, would you go get Denise?

812
00:39:55,993 --> 00:39:57,461
- Denise?

813
00:39:57,461 --> 00:39:59,063
- That bitch gives me the creeps.

814
00:39:59,063 --> 00:39:59,897
- Tracy?

815
00:39:59,897 --> 00:40:00,998
- No, Denise.

816
00:40:04,668 --> 00:40:06,103
- She's not here.

817
00:40:07,004 --> 00:40:09,673
- What do you mean, "she's not here."?

818
00:40:09,673 --> 00:40:14,378
- I mean, she's not in the
fucking house, Brandon.

819
00:40:14,378 --> 00:40:16,480
- She's gone too.

820
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:17,314
- Great.

821
00:40:23,554 --> 00:40:25,656
(birds chirping)

822
00:40:25,656 --> 00:40:27,057
- [Tracy] Denise?

823
00:40:28,292 --> 00:40:30,261
Oh my God, Brandon.

824
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:31,595
This is just getting too weird.

825
00:40:31,595 --> 00:40:33,030
What the fuck is going on?

826
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:34,632
- Okay, Brandon, this has gone too far.

827
00:40:34,632 --> 00:40:36,634
I want to go find my wife
and get the hell out of here.

828
00:40:36,634 --> 00:40:37,468
- Me too.

829
00:40:37,468 --> 00:40:38,636
- You guys, I swear to God,

830
00:40:38,636 --> 00:40:41,205
I have no idea what's going on.

831
00:40:42,072 --> 00:40:44,375
- I'm sorry we ever picked her up.

832
00:40:44,375 --> 00:40:47,678
- She is nothing but trouble, man.

833
00:40:47,678 --> 00:40:50,347
(nursery music)

834
00:40:52,316 --> 00:40:54,552
- So what you're trying to say is,

835
00:40:54,552 --> 00:40:58,889
is that she's a serial killer, is that it?

836
00:40:58,889 --> 00:41:00,090
- [Tracy] Did you guys see her eyes

837
00:41:00,090 --> 00:41:02,026
when she was telling that ghost story?

838
00:41:02,026 --> 00:41:03,727
I'm telling you she's a nutcase.

839
00:41:03,727 --> 00:41:05,095
(dramatic tones)

840
00:41:05,095 --> 00:41:06,530
- Hell yes, she is.

841
00:41:06,530 --> 00:41:08,032
- Look, call it woman's
intuition or whatever you want.

842
00:41:08,032 --> 00:41:09,166
But I'm telling you she's crazy.

843
00:41:09,166 --> 00:41:10,000
Look at the dolls.

844
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:10,868
Why the dolls?

845
00:41:10,868 --> 00:41:11,869
(suspenseful tones)

846
00:41:11,869 --> 00:41:12,703
And the laughing,

847
00:41:12,703 --> 00:41:13,537
(laughing)

848
00:41:13,537 --> 00:41:14,638
and now she's missing.

849
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:16,774
And that animal noise in the woods.

850
00:41:16,774 --> 00:41:17,942
Why is she never around

851
00:41:17,942 --> 00:41:20,144
when any of this creepy shit happens?

852
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:20,978
- Oh, I get it.

853
00:41:20,978 --> 00:41:22,246
So what you're saying is,

854
00:41:22,246 --> 00:41:24,381
she's out in the woods right now,

855
00:41:24,381 --> 00:41:26,083
making noises, is that it?

856
00:41:26,083 --> 00:41:27,518
That's good, Tracy.

857
00:41:27,518 --> 00:41:28,319
- No, Brandon,

858
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:29,153
what I'm trying to tell you is that

859
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:30,654
the bitch is nothing but trouble.

860
00:41:30,654 --> 00:41:31,889
- Oh come on, Tracy.

861
00:41:31,889 --> 00:41:33,023
- Look, don't talk to me.

862
00:41:33,023 --> 00:41:35,793
- In a forest, 12 miles from nowhere,

863
00:41:35,793 --> 00:41:38,295
strange noises, dolls without heads.

864
00:41:38,295 --> 00:41:39,563
What's next?

865
00:41:39,563 --> 00:41:41,198
Man, I've got to find my wife

866
00:41:41,198 --> 00:41:43,534
and get somewhere that
has some sanity to it.

867
00:41:43,534 --> 00:41:45,402
- Mark, will you settle down?

868
00:41:45,402 --> 00:41:46,704
We're looking for her.

869
00:41:46,704 --> 00:41:49,540
(shouting) Susan?

870
00:41:52,643 --> 00:41:53,644
The first time I came up here,

871
00:41:53,644 --> 00:41:56,547
I think I spent six hours
out here just looking around.

872
00:41:56,547 --> 00:41:57,581
- You get lost?

873
00:41:57,581 --> 00:41:58,415
- No, no.

874
00:41:58,415 --> 00:41:59,817
I was just looking around and stuff.

875
00:41:59,817 --> 00:42:02,152
You know, you get caught up.

876
00:42:04,722 --> 00:42:05,556
Careful.

877
00:42:07,291 --> 00:42:09,827
- You looking for me?

878
00:42:09,827 --> 00:42:10,661
- Nice doll.

879
00:42:10,661 --> 00:42:11,629
- You think so?

880
00:42:11,629 --> 00:42:13,097
I found it under the bed.

881
00:42:13,097 --> 00:42:13,931
I was going to show it to Mark,

882
00:42:13,931 --> 00:42:16,200
but he fucking attacked me.

883
00:42:17,434 --> 00:42:18,302
- Shut the fuck up.

884
00:42:18,302 --> 00:42:19,470
- What is she talking about?

885
00:42:19,470 --> 00:42:20,304
- Tell him.

886
00:42:20,304 --> 00:42:22,573
- Who cares what he did?
You probably deserved it.

887
00:42:22,573 --> 00:42:23,607
- You got a problem with me?

888
00:42:23,607 --> 00:42:24,441
- Yeah.

889
00:42:24,441 --> 00:42:25,276
- [Brandon] Whoa, whoa, whoa.

890
00:42:25,276 --> 00:42:26,544
Cut the crap, girls.

891
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:28,212
Let's go find Susan.

892
00:42:30,147 --> 00:42:30,981
- Bitch.

893
00:42:33,017 --> 00:42:35,319
Remember, I told you, she went for a walk.

894
00:42:35,319 --> 00:42:37,254
Said she'd be gone about an hour or so.

895
00:42:37,254 --> 00:42:39,623
Told me that she was taking
a walk to think about things.

896
00:42:39,623 --> 00:42:40,724
- When was this?

897
00:42:40,724 --> 00:42:41,692
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

898
00:42:41,692 --> 00:42:42,927
What did she say?

899
00:42:42,927 --> 00:42:43,861
- I'll let her tell you.

900
00:42:43,861 --> 00:42:45,496
- Bullshit, tell me what she said.

901
00:42:45,496 --> 00:42:47,932
- She said that marriage isn't
all it's cracked up to be.

902
00:42:47,932 --> 00:42:49,033
- Bullshit.

903
00:42:49,033 --> 00:42:50,000
- Don't believe me then.

904
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,168
- Why would we believe you?

905
00:42:51,168 --> 00:42:53,103
Like his wife is going to
tell a perfect stranger

906
00:42:53,103 --> 00:42:54,538
That kind of crap.

907
00:42:54,538 --> 00:42:55,706
- Truth hurts.

908
00:42:57,741 --> 00:43:01,145
- So Denise, did you
see which way she went?

909
00:43:01,145 --> 00:43:02,713
- That way.

910
00:43:02,713 --> 00:43:03,747
- I'm off.

911
00:43:03,747 --> 00:43:04,715
Brandon, are you coming?

912
00:43:04,715 --> 00:43:05,883
- Whoa, Mark.

913
00:43:05,883 --> 00:43:07,685
We don't know how long she's
going to be out there, okay?

914
00:43:07,685 --> 00:43:08,953
I say we go back to the house,

915
00:43:08,953 --> 00:43:10,387
we fill canteens up with water,

916
00:43:10,387 --> 00:43:11,922
and we come back and we do this right.

917
00:43:11,922 --> 00:43:12,856
Okay?

918
00:43:12,856 --> 00:43:13,691
- [Mark] Okay.

919
00:43:13,691 --> 00:43:14,525
- Come on.

920
00:43:21,932 --> 00:43:24,101
- Hey Brandon, did you
hear that weird noise?

921
00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:25,169
- Yeah. Why?

922
00:43:25,169 --> 00:43:27,137
- Because I was having a cigarette

923
00:43:27,137 --> 00:43:28,973
and before I heard the noises,

924
00:43:28,973 --> 00:43:30,574
I thought I heard someone talking.

925
00:43:30,574 --> 00:43:32,343
Were you guys in the woods already?

926
00:43:32,343 --> 00:43:34,778
- Are you sure it was
cigarettes you were smoking?

927
00:43:34,778 --> 00:43:36,847
- That was probably nothing.

928
00:43:36,847 --> 00:43:40,584
- Maybe, but the noises
were definitely real.

929
00:43:45,155 --> 00:43:45,990
- [Mark] What's that for?

930
00:43:45,990 --> 00:43:46,957
- [Brandon] What do you think it's for?

931
00:43:46,957 --> 00:43:48,192
- [Mark] You think there's
something out there?

932
00:43:48,192 --> 00:43:50,427
- No, but if there is, we're prepared.

933
00:43:50,427 --> 00:43:53,764
Do you girls want to
stay here at the house?

934
00:43:53,764 --> 00:43:54,999
- No way.
- No way.

935
00:43:54,999 --> 00:43:57,301
Let's just leave her a note.

936
00:44:06,844 --> 00:44:07,911
- Carry this.

937
00:44:11,382 --> 00:44:15,219
- You don't think anything
happened to her, do you?

938
00:44:15,219 --> 00:44:16,053
- No.

939
00:44:16,053 --> 00:44:18,088
I think she went out
there and she got lost.

940
00:44:18,088 --> 00:44:20,457
Something captured her attention.

941
00:44:20,457 --> 00:44:22,660
- Hey, do you guys think that
I should bring my cell phone?

942
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:25,362
- No, the cell phones don't work here.

943
00:44:25,362 --> 00:44:28,298
Okay, Denise, which way did she go?

944
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:30,934
- That way.

945
00:44:30,934 --> 00:44:32,369
- Okay, let's go.

946
00:44:39,943 --> 00:44:42,946
(adventurous music)

947
00:44:59,163 --> 00:45:01,131
- Well, keep your eyes peeled for Susan.

948
00:45:01,131 --> 00:45:03,901
Or any signs that she may
have been through here.

949
00:45:03,901 --> 00:45:05,102
- Hold on, I gotta pee.

950
00:45:05,102 --> 00:45:06,503
I'll catch up with you.

951
00:45:06,503 --> 00:45:08,038
- God damn it, Denise.

952
00:45:08,038 --> 00:45:09,506
- Hey, I gotta go.

953
00:45:12,576 --> 00:45:14,678
- Well, you better hurry.

954
00:45:22,386 --> 00:45:23,754
- She's nuts.

955
00:45:23,754 --> 00:45:24,588
- [Brandon] Base.

956
00:45:24,588 --> 00:45:26,123
- Yeah, no shit.

957
00:45:26,123 --> 00:45:27,124
- Well, hold on.

958
00:45:27,124 --> 00:45:29,059
We better wait for her.

959
00:45:29,059 --> 00:45:31,628
- I don't think we should
let her out of our sight.

960
00:45:31,628 --> 00:45:32,796
- Don't worry.

961
00:45:33,764 --> 00:45:35,599
- I'm already worried.

962
00:45:43,207 --> 00:45:44,108
- Feel better?

963
00:45:44,108 --> 00:45:46,610
- Yeah, but look what I found.

964
00:45:49,379 --> 00:45:52,116
- That's a piece of Susan's robe.

965
00:45:53,650 --> 00:45:56,386
(yelling) Susan?

966
00:45:57,488 --> 00:45:58,322
Susan?

967
00:46:03,293 --> 00:46:05,963
(nursery music)

968
00:46:06,864 --> 00:46:09,633
(muffled crying)

969
00:46:12,870 --> 00:46:15,706
(heavy breathing)

970
00:46:21,178 --> 00:46:23,213
- [Clown] How much wood

971
00:46:23,213 --> 00:46:26,049
could a wood chuck chuck,

972
00:46:26,049 --> 00:46:27,284
if a wood chuck

973
00:46:28,152 --> 00:46:29,520
could chuck

974
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:30,354
wood?

975
00:46:31,421 --> 00:46:34,258
(clown bellowing)

976
00:46:40,097 --> 00:46:41,465
- Where the hell is she?

977
00:46:41,465 --> 00:46:42,633
Brandon, you brought us up here.

978
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:44,268
If anything happens to her...

979
00:46:44,268 --> 00:46:45,502
- Mark, stop it.

980
00:46:45,502 --> 00:46:46,837
- Kick his ass, Mark.

981
00:46:46,837 --> 00:46:47,671
- Look, Mark.

982
00:46:47,671 --> 00:46:49,473
This is not helping, and
it's certainly not going

983
00:46:49,473 --> 00:46:50,908
to help us find Susan.

984
00:46:50,908 --> 00:46:51,742
- Look, Mark.

985
00:46:51,742 --> 00:46:52,643
We're all out here looking for hey, okay?

986
00:46:52,643 --> 00:46:53,844
Why don't you just calm down?

987
00:46:53,844 --> 00:46:55,512
- It's your fault.

988
00:46:55,512 --> 00:46:56,413
- He's right.

989
00:46:56,413 --> 00:46:57,848
You're the one that brought us here.

990
00:46:57,848 --> 00:46:59,149
- Look you fucking bitch,

991
00:46:59,149 --> 00:47:00,784
you keep your fucking mouth shut.

992
00:47:00,784 --> 00:47:02,352
Do you understand me?

993
00:47:02,352 --> 00:47:03,954
- You son of a bitch.

994
00:47:03,954 --> 00:47:05,956
- Nobody hits me. Nobody.

995
00:47:05,956 --> 00:47:07,491
- What the hell is
wrong with you, Brandon?

996
00:47:07,491 --> 00:47:09,059
- I have had it with with her shit.

997
00:47:09,059 --> 00:47:12,162
You brought this fucking
cunt along, not me.

998
00:47:12,162 --> 00:47:15,265
And if you know where Susan
is, you tell us right now.

999
00:47:15,265 --> 00:47:16,099
- Fuck you.

1000
00:47:16,099 --> 00:47:16,934
- Oh, fuck me?

1001
00:47:16,934 --> 00:47:17,835
Well, fuck you.

1002
00:47:17,835 --> 00:47:18,669
- Brandon.

1003
00:47:19,603 --> 00:47:22,406
Look, I think we all need to
go back and call the police.

1004
00:47:22,406 --> 00:47:23,407
Okay?

1005
00:47:23,407 --> 00:47:25,709
(screaming)

1006
00:47:29,913 --> 00:47:31,014
- Oh my God.

1007
00:47:33,083 --> 00:47:34,751
- Holy shit.

1008
00:47:34,751 --> 00:47:35,752
- [Denise] It's him.

1009
00:47:35,752 --> 00:47:36,587
- [Tracy] It's who?

1010
00:47:36,587 --> 00:47:37,421
- George.

1011
00:47:37,421 --> 00:47:38,455
- Who the fuck is George?

1012
00:47:38,455 --> 00:47:39,756
- The guy I hitched a ride with.

1013
00:47:39,756 --> 00:47:41,391
He was following me, I know it.

1014
00:47:41,391 --> 00:47:42,960
Yo, we've got to get out of here.

1015
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:44,428
- Look, I want to go
back and call the police

1016
00:47:44,428 --> 00:47:45,929
right fucking now.

1017
00:47:49,199 --> 00:47:50,767
(man screaming)

1018
00:47:50,767 --> 00:47:51,935
- Who is that?

1019
00:47:55,205 --> 00:47:57,341
(man screaming)

1020
00:47:57,341 --> 00:47:59,576
You're on private property.

1021
00:48:02,512 --> 00:48:04,114
Hey, Tracy's right.

1022
00:48:05,048 --> 00:48:09,820
Let's go back to the house
right now and call the police.

1023
00:48:20,163 --> 00:48:22,833
(dramatic tone)

1024
00:48:24,902 --> 00:48:27,638
(carnival music)

1025
00:48:29,373 --> 00:48:32,209
(heavy breathing)

1026
00:48:32,209 --> 00:48:34,945
(muffled crying)

1027
00:48:44,288 --> 00:48:47,124
(heavy breathing)

1028
00:48:48,792 --> 00:48:51,728
(Susan whimpering)

1029
00:49:00,604 --> 00:49:03,607
(suspenseful music)

1030
00:49:08,145 --> 00:49:11,214
I'm going to go call the sheriff.

1031
00:49:11,214 --> 00:49:13,550
- Hey, the note I left is gone.

1032
00:49:13,550 --> 00:49:14,785
Great.

1033
00:49:14,785 --> 00:49:16,386
She's always doing stuff like that.

1034
00:49:16,386 --> 00:49:18,422
She probably found her way back.

1035
00:49:18,422 --> 00:49:19,256
Susan?

1036
00:49:28,665 --> 00:49:29,499
Jesus.

1037
00:49:32,202 --> 00:49:33,270
What is this?

1038
00:49:35,872 --> 00:49:37,474
Brandon, come here.

1039
00:49:42,946 --> 00:49:43,947
Call the cops, man.

1040
00:49:43,947 --> 00:49:45,582
Denise must've been telling
the truth about that guy.

1041
00:49:45,582 --> 00:49:47,317
He's fucking with us.

1042
00:49:47,317 --> 00:49:48,285
- I can't.

1043
00:49:48,285 --> 00:49:49,486
- Holy shit.

1044
00:49:49,486 --> 00:49:51,221
- Brandon, seriously, call the cops.

1045
00:49:51,221 --> 00:49:52,456
We need some help.

1046
00:49:52,456 --> 00:49:53,357
- I said I couldn't.

1047
00:49:53,357 --> 00:49:54,324
- Why not?

1048
00:49:54,324 --> 00:49:55,559
- The phone's dead.

1049
00:49:55,559 --> 00:49:56,727
- Oh bullshit.

1050
00:50:00,230 --> 00:50:03,233
(suspenseful music)

1051
00:50:18,215 --> 00:50:19,049
Crap.

1052
00:50:21,318 --> 00:50:22,586
Give me the keys to the fucking car,

1053
00:50:22,586 --> 00:50:24,788
I'm going to get some help.

1054
00:50:24,788 --> 00:50:26,423
- He's going to kill us all one by one.

1055
00:50:26,423 --> 00:50:27,991
- I told you she trouble.

1056
00:50:27,991 --> 00:50:28,992
- [Mark] Brandon, the keys.

1057
00:50:28,992 --> 00:50:29,993
- I gotta find them.

1058
00:50:29,993 --> 00:50:31,428
- Tracy, what about your cell phone?

1059
00:50:31,428 --> 00:50:32,262
- Oh.

1060
00:50:32,262 --> 00:50:34,698
- Try it. God, please try it.

1061
00:50:39,069 --> 00:50:40,303
- [Brandon] No service.

1062
00:50:40,303 --> 00:50:41,872
I could have told you that.

1063
00:50:41,872 --> 00:50:43,407
- You better find those fucking keys.

1064
00:50:43,407 --> 00:50:44,908
- [Tracy] Oh shit.

1065
00:50:51,048 --> 00:50:52,382
- Here they are.

1066
00:50:57,454 --> 00:50:58,355
- [Tracy] We'll get some people up here

1067
00:50:58,355 --> 00:50:59,756
to help us find Susan.

1068
00:50:59,756 --> 00:51:01,425
- [Denise] It's too late,
he's already killed her.

1069
00:51:01,425 --> 00:51:02,859
- [Mark] Shut up, Denise.

1070
00:51:02,859 --> 00:51:04,661
- [Denise] You'll be next, asshole.

1071
00:51:04,661 --> 00:51:05,629
Then Tracy,

1072
00:51:05,629 --> 00:51:06,463
then Brandon,

1073
00:51:06,463 --> 00:51:08,298
then finally me, I just know it.

1074
00:51:08,298 --> 00:51:10,200
- What the fuck are you talking about?

1075
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:11,201
- I knew he was bad news,

1076
00:51:11,201 --> 00:51:12,803
but I never thought this
was going to happen.

1077
00:51:12,803 --> 00:51:14,337
He's going to kill us all.

1078
00:51:14,337 --> 00:51:15,972
- [Tracy] Brandon, get
her away from me now.

1079
00:51:15,972 --> 00:51:17,407
- Stop it.

1080
00:51:17,407 --> 00:51:19,676
Let's get out of here before
he does kill somebody.

1081
00:51:19,676 --> 00:51:21,411
The quicker we get somebody out here,

1082
00:51:21,411 --> 00:51:23,814
the quicker we'll find Susan.

1083
00:51:27,217 --> 00:51:29,653
(engine stuttering)
- [Mark] Now what?

1084
00:51:29,653 --> 00:51:32,589
Come on, Brandon, don't flood it.

1085
00:51:32,589 --> 00:51:33,423
- Dammit.

1086
00:51:40,063 --> 00:51:43,100
(dramatic tone)

1087
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:45,836
- [Tracy] What the hell was that?

1088
00:51:48,071 --> 00:51:48,905
Fuck.

1089
00:51:49,873 --> 00:51:50,841
(scoffing)

1090
00:51:50,841 --> 00:51:51,942
- God dammit.

1091
00:51:57,147 --> 00:51:58,715
We're not going anywhere.

1092
00:51:58,715 --> 00:51:59,549
- It's him.

1093
00:51:59,549 --> 00:52:00,617
He's fucked with the car.

1094
00:52:00,617 --> 00:52:02,219
- Will you shut up?

1095
00:52:02,219 --> 00:52:03,453
- What's wrong?

1096
00:52:03,453 --> 00:52:04,621
The distributor wire.

1097
00:52:04,621 --> 00:52:06,189
Someone's fucked with
the distributor wires.

1098
00:52:06,189 --> 00:52:07,757
That car's not going to start.

1099
00:52:07,757 --> 00:52:08,992
- [Denise] I told you.

1100
00:52:08,992 --> 00:52:10,760
- This is all your
fault, you little bitch.

1101
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:12,429
- You're the one who
wanted to bring her along.

1102
00:52:12,429 --> 00:52:13,563
- Oh, fuck off, Mark.

1103
00:52:13,563 --> 00:52:14,764
- Yeah, fuck you too.

1104
00:52:14,764 --> 00:52:18,401
- Come on, that's not
going to help anything.

1105
00:52:18,401 --> 00:52:20,670
- What are we going to do?

1106
00:52:20,670 --> 00:52:23,039
- Well first off, there is four of us.

1107
00:52:23,039 --> 00:52:26,643
And I have a gun and I will
not hesitate to use it.

1108
00:52:26,643 --> 00:52:29,546
- Maybe we should just
walk to the highway.

1109
00:52:29,546 --> 00:52:30,780
- No, no, no, no.

1110
00:52:30,780 --> 00:52:32,282
It's 12 miles to the nearest highway

1111
00:52:32,282 --> 00:52:33,884
and it's going to be dark in two hours.

1112
00:52:33,884 --> 00:52:34,718
No way.

1113
00:52:39,756 --> 00:52:40,924
Wait a minute.

1114
00:52:42,092 --> 00:52:44,694
My uncle used to keep tractors up here,

1115
00:52:44,694 --> 00:52:46,196
and he'd keep all the tractor parts

1116
00:52:46,196 --> 00:52:47,664
and spare wires in the shed.

1117
00:52:47,664 --> 00:52:50,433
Maybe he still has some in there.

1118
00:52:57,707 --> 00:53:00,377
(keys jingling)

1119
00:53:05,815 --> 00:53:07,284
Mark, would you go to the back of my truck

1120
00:53:07,284 --> 00:53:09,519
and get the tire iron?

1121
00:53:09,519 --> 00:53:12,522
(suspenseful music)

1122
00:53:28,672 --> 00:53:29,673
Oh, fuck me.

1123
00:53:32,008 --> 00:53:34,477
- Oh my- (coughing)

1124
00:53:34,477 --> 00:53:37,981
Oh my God, Brandon, what the hell is that?

1125
00:53:40,584 --> 00:53:42,752
- [Mark] This is bullshit.

1126
00:53:44,454 --> 00:53:47,691
- [Denise] It looks like some
sort of ritualistic shit.

1127
00:53:47,691 --> 00:53:48,825
Brandon, what the hell?

1128
00:53:48,825 --> 00:53:51,461
You said this was your family's place?

1129
00:53:51,995 --> 00:53:53,063
What did you do?

1130
00:53:54,431 --> 00:53:55,999
- Oh, we're fucked.

1131
00:53:56,333 --> 00:53:58,468
- Brandon, what is this?

1132
00:53:58,468 --> 00:54:00,036
- Look, I don't know what it is.

1133
00:54:00,036 --> 00:54:02,172
Jesus Christ, I've never...

1134
00:54:02,172 --> 00:54:03,206
I don't know.

1135
00:54:03,206 --> 00:54:04,274
- It's George.

1136
00:54:04,274 --> 00:54:05,909
When are you guys going
to start believing me?

1137
00:54:05,909 --> 00:54:07,377
I'm telling you it's him.

1138
00:54:07,377 --> 00:54:08,278
- It can't be, Denise.

1139
00:54:08,278 --> 00:54:09,646
Those people must have been...

1140
00:54:09,646 --> 00:54:12,916
(muffled crying)

1141
00:54:12,916 --> 00:54:13,984
killed before.

1142
00:54:13,984 --> 00:54:14,818
- I'm telling you-

1143
00:54:14,818 --> 00:54:16,019
- Oh, pull your head
out of your ass, Denise.

1144
00:54:16,019 --> 00:54:16,953
What are you saying?

1145
00:54:16,953 --> 00:54:18,288
Are you saying that some guy

1146
00:54:18,288 --> 00:54:20,156
knew you were coming here to this place?

1147
00:54:20,156 --> 00:54:24,027
And so he went back into
time and killed those people?

1148
00:54:24,027 --> 00:54:27,664
- I know it sounds crazy, but
I'm telling you the truth.

1149
00:54:27,664 --> 00:54:28,632
(coughing)

1150
00:54:28,632 --> 00:54:29,833
- They're not there.

1151
00:54:29,833 --> 00:54:30,667
- What?

1152
00:54:30,667 --> 00:54:31,735
- [Brandon] The tractor parts,

1153
00:54:31,735 --> 00:54:33,403
the car parts, the distributor cap.

1154
00:54:33,403 --> 00:54:34,638
They're not there.

1155
00:54:34,638 --> 00:54:36,473
- Okay, Brandon, look, this is
just getting to be too much.

1156
00:54:36,473 --> 00:54:37,307
Okay?

1157
00:54:37,307 --> 00:54:38,141
I want to go in the house,

1158
00:54:38,141 --> 00:54:40,076
lock the doors and I want to
to get the hell out of here

1159
00:54:40,076 --> 00:54:40,877
first thing in the morning.

1160
00:54:40,877 --> 00:54:41,711
- Okay, okay.

1161
00:54:41,711 --> 00:54:42,545
- Okay?

1162
00:54:42,545 --> 00:54:45,215
- Can you guys come
over here for a minute?

1163
00:54:58,561 --> 00:55:00,363
- I'm going to go look for my wife.

1164
00:55:00,363 --> 00:55:02,532
Does anybody want to come?

1165
00:55:03,833 --> 00:55:04,934
- [Denise] I'll go.

1166
00:55:04,934 --> 00:55:05,735
- [Tracy] Do you guys really think

1167
00:55:05,735 --> 00:55:07,737
we should be splitting up?

1168
00:55:07,737 --> 00:55:09,306
- We're staying here for the night, right?

1169
00:55:09,306 --> 00:55:10,140
- Yeah.

1170
00:55:11,474 --> 00:55:15,245
- I want to go look one more
time before it gets dark.

1171
00:55:15,245 --> 00:55:16,079
- All right,

1172
00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:20,083
Tracy and I are going to
stay here in the house.

1173
00:55:21,751 --> 00:55:22,585
- Fine.

1174
00:55:30,126 --> 00:55:32,195
- I'm so scared, Brandon.

1175
00:55:35,098 --> 00:55:35,932
- Look,

1176
00:55:35,932 --> 00:55:40,704
it's going to get dark soon
and it could be a long night.

1177
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:53,383
(mysterious music)

1178
00:56:32,422 --> 00:56:35,325
- (yelling) Susan?

1179
00:56:39,929 --> 00:56:40,764
Susan?

1180
00:56:43,466 --> 00:56:44,901
- This is fucked.

1181
00:56:55,412 --> 00:56:57,914
(wood chopping)

1182
00:56:57,914 --> 00:56:59,349
Do you hear that?

1183
00:57:03,386 --> 00:57:04,854
- What is that?

1184
00:57:04,854 --> 00:57:05,688
- I don't know.

1185
00:57:05,688 --> 00:57:07,957
(wood chopping)

1186
00:57:07,957 --> 00:57:10,260
It could be coming from pretty far away.

1187
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:13,496
- (yelling) Susan?

1188
00:57:13,496 --> 00:57:15,298
- I'm tired.

1189
00:57:15,298 --> 00:57:16,132
- Me too.

1190
00:57:22,639 --> 00:57:23,540
Denise,

1191
00:57:23,540 --> 00:57:27,310
tell me about this guy that picked you up.

1192
00:57:27,310 --> 00:57:29,279
Why do you think he's following you?

1193
00:57:29,279 --> 00:57:32,115
- No, I just said that to
fuck with Tracy and Brandon.

1194
00:57:32,115 --> 00:57:33,349
They piss me off.

1195
00:57:33,349 --> 00:57:36,052
That's why I wanted to come
with you so I can tell you that.

1196
00:57:36,052 --> 00:57:36,953
I know you're getting upset.

1197
00:57:36,953 --> 00:57:38,254
- Fucking A, I'm upset.

1198
00:57:38,254 --> 00:57:40,056
- Mark, it's going to be okay.

1199
00:57:40,056 --> 00:57:42,358
(wood chopping)

1200
00:57:42,358 --> 00:57:44,461
There's that noise again.

1201
00:57:46,029 --> 00:57:49,466
(wood chopping)

1202
00:57:49,466 --> 00:57:52,068
Sounds like wood being chopped.

1203
00:58:04,347 --> 00:58:06,549
- Did Susan really say
those things to you?

1204
00:58:06,549 --> 00:58:09,552
(suspenseful music)

1205
00:58:17,460 --> 00:58:18,461
- Do you really think that guy

1206
00:58:18,461 --> 00:58:20,096
could have followed Denise?

1207
00:58:20,096 --> 00:58:21,965
- No, it doesn't add up.

1208
00:58:21,965 --> 00:58:23,032
- What do you mean?

1209
00:58:23,032 --> 00:58:24,901
- Well, let's think about it.

1210
00:58:24,901 --> 00:58:27,136
Susan gets up this morning to take a walk,

1211
00:58:27,136 --> 00:58:29,239
and Denise is the last one to talk to her?

1212
00:58:29,239 --> 00:58:30,540
- Well, she claims she was.

1213
00:58:30,540 --> 00:58:31,374
- Right.

1214
00:58:31,374 --> 00:58:34,577
And then we find a doll
in the refrigerator,

1215
00:58:34,577 --> 00:58:38,081
and Denise has a big laugh about it.

1216
00:58:38,081 --> 00:58:40,250
- And the note was crumpled up,

1217
00:58:40,250 --> 00:58:43,253
and the clothes were laid out on the bed.

1218
00:58:43,253 --> 00:58:45,088
And she was the last one to go inside

1219
00:58:45,088 --> 00:58:47,590
to use the bathroom before
we went to look for Susan.

1220
00:58:47,590 --> 00:58:48,791
- Hold on, I gotta pee.

1221
00:58:48,791 --> 00:58:50,693
I'll catch up with you.

1222
00:58:53,162 --> 00:58:54,831
- Yeah, but she didn't have time

1223
00:58:54,831 --> 00:58:58,501
to cut the phone cord
and play with the car.

1224
00:59:00,670 --> 00:59:01,771
- Yeah, you're right.

1225
00:59:01,771 --> 00:59:03,339
It doesn't add up.

1226
00:59:03,339 --> 00:59:05,208
(wood chopping)

1227
00:59:05,208 --> 00:59:07,210
- You guys been having problems?

1228
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:08,044
- Some.

1229
00:59:09,512 --> 00:59:11,648
Things have gotten
pretty fucked up with us.

1230
00:59:11,648 --> 00:59:13,383
(wood chopping)

1231
00:59:13,383 --> 00:59:15,618
- I'm really sorry, Mark.

1232
00:59:15,618 --> 00:59:19,255
- She really told you she
needed to do some thinking?

1233
00:59:19,255 --> 00:59:20,723
- Yeah.

1234
00:59:20,723 --> 00:59:23,059
That means something to you?

1235
00:59:26,429 --> 00:59:30,199
- Well, she's been
thinking about leaving me.

1236
00:59:32,535 --> 00:59:35,138
She suggested an open marriage.

1237
00:59:35,972 --> 00:59:37,106
- So in other words,

1238
00:59:37,106 --> 00:59:39,576
she wants permission to fuck other guys?

1239
00:59:39,576 --> 00:59:40,410
(wood chopping)

1240
00:59:40,410 --> 00:59:41,244
- Exactly.

1241
00:59:42,545 --> 00:59:46,115
- Mark, you deserve a
lot better than that.

1242
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:51,020
(wood chopping)

1243
00:59:54,257 --> 00:59:56,993
(dramatic music)

1244
01:00:41,371 --> 01:00:45,041
(wood chopping intensifies)

1245
01:00:53,816 --> 01:00:57,920

(suspenseful music)

1252
01:01:26,816 --> 01:01:30,119
- [Tracy] I swear, this place
gives me the creeps, Brandon.

1253
01:01:30,119 --> 01:01:32,889
You sure we're going to
be safe here all night?

1254
01:01:32,889 --> 01:01:33,723
- [Brandon] Yeah.

1255
01:01:33,723 --> 01:01:37,293
I just wish Mark and
Denise would get back.

1256
01:01:39,495 --> 01:01:44,400
Hey, my uncle used to keep a
CB radio here for emergencies.

1257
01:01:45,468 --> 01:01:46,502
- Well, what are we waiting for?

1258
01:01:46,502 --> 01:01:47,937
- I don't know.
- Let's go.

1259
01:01:47,937 --> 01:01:48,871
- I'm going to go check the back room.

1260
01:01:48,871 --> 01:01:51,641
- I'll go check the kitchen.

1261
01:01:51,641 --> 01:01:54,077
- [Clown] ♪ Ring around the rosey ♪

(clown laughing)

1266
01:02:12,895 --> 01:02:14,197
- Did that help?

1267
01:02:19,402 --> 01:02:21,971
We'd better head back to the
house before it gets dark.

1268
01:02:21,971 --> 01:02:23,673
- I really want to look a little longer.

1269
01:02:23,673 --> 01:02:24,874
You can go back.

1270
01:02:24,874 --> 01:02:25,708
- All right, fine.

1271
01:02:25,708 --> 01:02:26,676
We'll look for like 10 more minutes

1272
01:02:26,676 --> 01:02:28,478
and then we'll head back.

1273
01:02:28,478 --> 01:02:30,580
Let's go this way.

1274
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:32,782
- Susan would have stayed on the path.

1275
01:02:32,782 --> 01:02:35,852
We'll cover more ground
if we split up anyway.

1276
01:02:35,852 --> 01:02:37,019
- What a dick.

1277
01:02:38,087 --> 01:02:39,522
- Are you scared to go by yourself?

1278
01:02:39,522 --> 01:02:40,356
- No.

1279
01:02:42,625 --> 01:02:45,294
(nursery music)

1280
01:03:06,749 --> 01:03:09,752
(adventurous music)

1281
01:03:35,278 --> 01:03:36,112
- Jackpot.

1282
01:03:39,982 --> 01:03:41,217
Let's hope this works.

1283
01:03:41,217 --> 01:03:42,218
Will you go plug that in?

1284
01:03:42,218 --> 01:03:43,486
- [Tracy] Yeah.

1285
01:03:47,590 --> 01:03:48,658
(radio static)

1286
01:03:48,658 --> 01:03:50,293
- [Brandon] Kick-ass.

1287
01:03:50,293 --> 01:03:51,961
This is Brandon Walker.

1288
01:03:51,961 --> 01:03:53,596
We are stranded at the Walker place

1289
01:03:53,596 --> 01:03:56,666
on county road, 34, near Cool Springs.

1290
01:03:56,666 --> 01:03:57,667
Do you copy?

1291
01:03:57,667 --> 01:04:00,269
(radio static)

1292
01:04:01,237 --> 01:04:02,371
This is Brandon Walker.

1293
01:04:02,371 --> 01:04:04,106
We are stranded at the Walker place

1294
01:04:04,106 --> 01:04:07,844
on county road, 34, just
South of Cool Springs.

1295
01:04:07,844 --> 01:04:09,245
Do you copy?

1296
01:04:09,245 --> 01:04:11,814
(radio static)

1297
01:04:14,150 --> 01:04:15,484
- Help, this is an emergency.

1298
01:04:15,484 --> 01:04:16,752
Is anybody out there?

1299
01:04:16,752 --> 01:04:18,187
(radio static)

1300
01:04:18,187 --> 01:04:20,122
Please help, this is an emergency.

1301
01:04:20,122 --> 01:04:21,324
We need help immediately.

1302
01:04:21,324 --> 01:04:22,391
Is anybody out there?

1303
01:04:22,391 --> 01:04:23,759
(radio static)

1304
01:04:23,759 --> 01:04:24,594
Dammit.

1305
01:04:25,962 --> 01:04:26,896
- [Radio] Copy that.

1306
01:04:26,896 --> 01:04:28,431
We hear your distress signal.

1307
01:04:28,431 --> 01:04:30,066
Can you give the location again?

1308
01:04:30,066 --> 01:04:30,900
- Yes we copy.

1309
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:32,235
This is Brandon Walker,

1310
01:04:32,235 --> 01:04:34,470
on county road, 34,

1311
01:04:34,470 --> 01:04:36,005
just South of Cool Springs.

1312
01:04:36,005 --> 01:04:38,608
It's an emergency, you need to send help.

1313
01:04:38,608 --> 01:04:41,143
- [Radio] You're breaking up pretty badly.

1314
01:04:41,143 --> 01:04:42,945
Can you repeat what you've said? Over.

1315
01:04:42,945 --> 01:04:45,414
- We are stranded at the old Walker place

1316
01:04:45,414 --> 01:04:48,985
on county road, 34, South of Cool Springs.

1317
01:04:48,985 --> 01:04:50,286
Do you copy?

1318
01:04:50,286 --> 01:04:52,221
- [Radio] County road 44, over.

1319
01:04:52,221 --> 01:04:54,490
- County road, 34.

1320
01:04:54,490 --> 01:04:56,259
- [Radio] County road, 34.

1321
01:04:56,259 --> 01:04:57,260
The old Walker place.

1322
01:04:57,260 --> 01:04:58,327
We've got it.

1323
01:04:58,327 --> 01:05:01,264
We will send help, sit tight.

1324
01:05:01,264 --> 01:05:03,933
(flies buzzing)

1325
01:05:09,405 --> 01:05:12,408
(suspenseful music)

1326
01:05:17,313 --> 01:05:20,249
- (yelling) Susan?

1327
01:05:26,789 --> 01:05:27,623
Susan?

1328
01:05:36,899 --> 01:05:37,733
Susan?

1329
01:05:38,935 --> 01:05:41,771
(heavy breathing)

1330
01:05:56,319 --> 01:05:57,153
Susan?

1331
01:06:03,225 --> 01:06:06,062
(heavy breathing)

1332
01:06:16,472 --> 01:06:19,475
(light piano music)

1333
01:07:01,183 --> 01:07:04,020
(heavy breathing)

1334
01:07:07,990 --> 01:07:10,993
(crickets chirping)

1335
01:07:29,378 --> 01:07:32,214
(heavy breathing)

1336
01:07:34,383 --> 01:07:37,386
(suspenseful music)

1337
01:08:03,212 --> 01:08:05,881
(flies buzzing)

1338
01:08:05,881 --> 01:08:09,285
(intense dramatic music)

1339
01:09:00,603 --> 01:09:02,771
(gagging)

1340
01:09:44,747 --> 01:09:47,516
(carnival music)

1341
01:09:49,451 --> 01:09:50,686
Susan?

1342
01:09:50,686 --> 01:09:52,788
Where have you been?

1343
01:09:52,788 --> 01:09:55,324
Susan, I've been looking all over for you.

1344
01:09:55,324 --> 01:09:56,458
Susan?

1345
01:09:57,159 --> 01:09:58,360
Oh my God!

1346
01:09:58,827 --> 01:10:00,262
No.

1347
01:10:00,262 --> 01:10:01,664
No.

1348
01:10:01,664 --> 01:10:02,498
Susan.

1349
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:05,834
No.

1350
01:10:07,736 --> 01:10:10,506
(clown laughing)

1351
01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:14,376
(dramatic music)

1352
01:10:48,877 --> 01:10:50,980
- [Tracy] Where's Mark?

1353
01:10:50,980 --> 01:10:52,147
- Mark killed her.

1354
01:10:52,147 --> 01:10:53,082
Susan.

1355
01:10:53,082 --> 01:10:53,983
She's dead.

1356
01:10:55,017 --> 01:10:56,485
- You're a liar.

1357
01:10:56,485 --> 01:10:57,786
- No, I'm telling the truth.

1358
01:10:57,786 --> 01:11:00,155
I saw her, he chopped her head off.

1359
01:11:00,155 --> 01:11:01,323
He chopped her head off.

1360
01:11:01,323 --> 01:11:02,157
- [Brandon] Who?

1361
01:11:02,157 --> 01:11:02,992
- Mark.

1362
01:11:02,992 --> 01:11:04,260
It was like he didn't want me to find her.

1363
01:11:04,260 --> 01:11:05,094
- [Mark] Susan.

1364
01:11:05,094 --> 01:11:06,662
Don't fuck with me.

1365
01:11:07,930 --> 01:11:08,764
Jesus.

1366
01:11:10,266 --> 01:11:12,768
- He chopped her head off.

1367
01:11:12,768 --> 01:11:14,136
- Nuh-uh. He wouldn't do that.

1368
01:11:14,136 --> 01:11:16,205
- I don't believe that Mark
would kill his own wife.

1369
01:11:16,205 --> 01:11:17,740
Brandon?

1370
01:11:17,740 --> 01:11:18,574
- Nuh-uh.

1371
01:11:18,574 --> 01:11:19,942
No way, he couldn't do it.

1372
01:11:19,942 --> 01:11:21,210
- Did you know they were having problems?

1373
01:11:21,210 --> 01:11:25,381
Did you know that she wanted to leave him?

1374
01:11:25,381 --> 01:11:26,849
- When did he tell you that?

1375
01:11:26,849 --> 01:11:28,183
- He told me that she wanted to leave him.

1376
01:11:28,183 --> 01:11:29,685
She wanted to split up.

1377
01:11:29,685 --> 01:11:30,653
- When did he tell you that?

1378
01:11:30,653 --> 01:11:31,854
- This afternoon.

1379
01:11:31,854 --> 01:11:34,390
- Oh, so one minute it's
George, and the next it's Mark.

1380
01:11:34,390 --> 01:11:36,492
Come on, Denise.

1381
01:11:36,492 --> 01:11:39,194
- That was before I saw
the look in Mark's eyes.

1382
01:11:39,194 --> 01:11:41,230
Besides, I really didn't
think it was George.

1383
01:11:41,230 --> 01:11:42,464
- [Tracy] What?

1384
01:11:43,465 --> 01:11:44,600
- I'm an idiot.

1385
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:46,935
I thought we were going to
go out there and find her.

1386
01:11:46,935 --> 01:11:49,571
I thought she was just lost in the woods.

1387
01:11:49,571 --> 01:11:50,973
I didn't know he was going to kill her.

1388
01:11:50,973 --> 01:11:52,841
- Okay. So which story are
we supposed to believe?

1389
01:11:52,841 --> 01:11:55,744
The one now or the one before?

1390
01:11:55,744 --> 01:11:57,279
And Susan's out there dead?

1391
01:11:57,279 --> 01:11:58,280
You show us.

1392
01:11:58,280 --> 01:12:00,783
- Okay, look, this time
I'm telling the truth.

1393
01:12:00,783 --> 01:12:02,685
No shit, Susan is dead.

1394
01:12:03,686 --> 01:12:05,020
Mark killed her.

1395
01:12:07,189 --> 01:12:08,590
When are you guys going
to start believing me?

1396
01:12:08,590 --> 01:12:09,625
He killed her.

1397
01:12:09,625 --> 01:12:13,028
How do we know that you
didn't kill her and Mark?

1398
01:12:13,028 --> 01:12:14,563
How do we know that you aren't trying

1399
01:12:14,563 --> 01:12:16,532
to lure us out there
so you can kill us too?

1400
01:12:16,532 --> 01:12:18,534
- Where is Mark, Denise?

1401
01:12:23,172 --> 01:12:24,006
Uh-huh, yeah.

1402
01:12:24,006 --> 01:12:26,608
I think you should sit down
in this chair right now.

1403
01:12:26,608 --> 01:12:27,443
Go.

1404
01:12:32,114 --> 01:12:33,282
- Come on, Brandon.

1405
01:12:33,282 --> 01:12:34,450
Don't do this.

1406
01:12:35,684 --> 01:12:36,518
- Tracy.

1407
01:12:36,518 --> 01:12:38,520
There's some rope in the kitchen drawer.

1408
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:39,421
Top one on the right.

1409
01:12:39,421 --> 01:12:41,390
Go get it please.

1410
01:12:41,390 --> 01:12:43,158
- You're making a big mistake.

1411
01:12:43,158 --> 01:12:43,992
- Uh-huh?

1412
01:12:43,992 --> 01:12:45,127
- I'm going to tell
her what you did to me.

1413
01:12:45,127 --> 01:12:46,795
- Oh no, you're not.

1414
01:12:48,697 --> 01:12:49,732
Here, take this.

1415
01:12:49,732 --> 01:12:50,566
Hold it on her.

1416
01:12:50,566 --> 01:12:52,568
If she moves, shoot her.

1417
01:12:53,669 --> 01:12:54,970
- No, come on.

1418
01:12:54,970 --> 01:12:56,505
Don't do this to me.

1419
01:12:56,505 --> 01:12:57,573
(gun clicking)

1420
01:12:57,573 --> 01:13:00,609
- This is for your protection
as well as ours, Denise.

1421
01:13:00,609 --> 01:13:02,277
- But you have the gun.

1422
01:13:02,277 --> 01:13:04,179
You yourself said we should stay together.

1423
01:13:04,179 --> 01:13:06,081
One against four, remember?

1424
01:13:06,081 --> 01:13:08,550
- Yeah, well, I don't trust you anymore.

1425
01:13:08,550 --> 01:13:09,385
Okay.

1426
01:13:09,385 --> 01:13:12,054
I'm going to go look for Mark.

1427
01:13:12,054 --> 01:13:15,391
You stay here and keep an eye on her.

1428
01:13:15,391 --> 01:13:18,560
The Sheriff should be here any minute.

1429
01:13:22,765 --> 01:13:25,768
(crickets chirping)

1430
01:13:32,641 --> 01:13:35,377
(dramatic music)

1431
01:13:43,919 --> 01:13:46,488
(Mark panting)

1432
01:13:53,562 --> 01:13:56,398
(heavy breathing)

1433
01:14:02,438 --> 01:14:04,807
(crickets chirping)

1434
01:14:04,807 --> 01:14:05,808
- Listen, Tracy.

1435
01:14:05,808 --> 01:14:07,109
I didn't kill anybody.

1436
01:14:07,109 --> 01:14:08,577
- I didn't say that you did.

1437
01:14:08,577 --> 01:14:09,511
But you know what?

1438
01:14:09,511 --> 01:14:11,046
You're a fucked up little bitch.

1439
01:14:11,046 --> 01:14:13,081
And until this situation
is straightened out,

1440
01:14:13,081 --> 01:14:14,349
you're staying right there.

1441
01:14:14,349 --> 01:14:15,951
- I'm telling the truth now.

1442
01:14:15,951 --> 01:14:18,120
I didn't kill anybody.

1443
01:14:18,120 --> 01:14:19,655
- You know, what about Brandon?

1444
01:14:19,655 --> 01:14:21,223
How well do you know him?

1445
01:14:21,223 --> 01:14:22,658
It's his family's place
and there are bodies

1446
01:14:22,658 --> 01:14:24,860
all over the fucking
place, for Christ sakes.

1447
01:14:24,860 --> 01:14:26,228
Who do you think did that?

1448
01:14:26,228 --> 01:14:27,095
- I know him.

1449
01:14:27,095 --> 01:14:27,996
- Do you?

1450
01:14:27,996 --> 01:14:28,897
- That's what I said.

1451
01:14:28,897 --> 01:14:31,467
- Do you know that I fucked him?

1452
01:14:31,467 --> 01:14:33,302
- You know, you're lying.

1453
01:14:33,302 --> 01:14:34,803
I know what you're trying to do here,

1454
01:14:34,803 --> 01:14:36,238
and you're not going to get away with it.

1455
01:14:36,238 --> 01:14:37,573
You don't know him that well, do you?

1456
01:14:37,573 --> 01:14:38,607
Look, I know that Brandon

1457
01:14:38,607 --> 01:14:40,409
wouldn't have killed all of those people.

1458
01:14:40,409 --> 01:14:43,412
Besides, I was with him
when he called the sheriff.

1459
01:14:43,412 --> 01:14:44,446
- Oh, how'd he do that?

1460
01:14:44,446 --> 01:14:45,581
With a secret phone?

1461
01:14:45,581 --> 01:14:47,749
- No, we found a CB radio.

1462
01:14:48,817 --> 01:14:50,786
- Pull your head out of your ass.

1463
01:14:50,786 --> 01:14:53,555
This whole thing is a set
up to get us all killed.

1464
01:14:53,555 --> 01:14:54,857
Like the people in the shed.

1465
01:14:54,857 --> 01:14:56,124
Explain that.

1466
01:14:56,124 --> 01:14:57,359
Do you think I did that?

1467
01:14:57,359 --> 01:14:58,627
When?

1468
01:14:58,627 --> 01:15:00,462
Who do you think did it, Tracy?

1469
01:15:00,462 --> 01:15:02,231
Brandon did.

1470
01:15:02,231 --> 01:15:04,233
Did you fuck Brandon last night?

1471
01:15:04,233 --> 01:15:05,067
I did.

1472
01:15:05,067 --> 01:15:06,602
- You're a fucking liar.

1473
01:15:06,602 --> 01:15:09,371
- Did he make that little
noise when he came for you?

1474
01:15:09,371 --> 01:15:11,874
That high-pitched little moan?

1475
01:15:14,710 --> 01:15:16,979
(high-pitched moan)

1476
01:15:16,979 --> 01:15:18,413
Yeah, thought so.

1477
01:15:20,749 --> 01:15:23,852
(crickets chirping)

1478
01:15:37,499 --> 01:15:39,034
- [Brandon] Give me the gun.

1479
01:15:39,034 --> 01:15:40,202
- Why?

1480
01:15:40,202 --> 01:15:41,036
- [Brandon] What?

1481
01:15:41,036 --> 01:15:42,371
Give me the gun.

1482
01:15:46,875 --> 01:15:51,179
Denise, what exactly did
you and Mark see out there?

1483
01:15:53,482 --> 01:15:56,151
- We decided to separate
to look for Susan.

1484
01:15:56,151 --> 01:15:58,820
(nursery music)

1485
01:16:00,255 --> 01:16:02,257
And I came to this area

1486
01:16:02,257 --> 01:16:03,992
that had dolls hanging from the trees.

1487
01:16:03,992 --> 01:16:06,795
(suspenseful music)

1488
01:16:06,795 --> 01:16:08,330
like the dolls in the shed.

1489
01:16:08,330 --> 01:16:09,765
And I turned around,

1490
01:16:09,765 --> 01:16:12,768
and I saw Mark standing over
Susan's body under the tree.

1491
01:16:12,768 --> 01:16:14,036
He chopped her head off.

1492
01:16:14,036 --> 01:16:16,004
- You're a fucking liar.

1493
01:16:17,472 --> 01:16:19,308
- Where's the sheriff?

1494
01:16:25,948 --> 01:16:26,915
- What are you doing now?

1495
01:16:26,915 --> 01:16:28,183
- I'm untying her.

1496
01:16:28,183 --> 01:16:29,952
She's not going anywhere.

1497
01:16:29,952 --> 01:16:32,087
It's dark out there.

1498
01:16:32,087 --> 01:16:33,488
- [Radio] Hello, this is the sheriff.

1499
01:16:33,488 --> 01:16:34,656
Is anyone out there?

1500
01:16:34,656 --> 01:16:36,058
Hello, sheriff here.

1501
01:16:36,058 --> 01:16:37,492
Do you copy?

1502
01:16:37,492 --> 01:16:40,295
- We didn't copy that
last statement. Over.

1503
01:16:40,295 --> 01:16:41,830
- [Radio] Are these the
people out near Cool Springs

1504
01:16:41,830 --> 01:16:43,365
that are having all the trouble?

1505
01:16:43,365 --> 01:16:45,834
I need your location again.

1506
01:16:45,834 --> 01:16:49,037
- County road, 34, just
South of Cool Springs.

1507
01:16:49,037 --> 01:16:50,038
Do you copy?

1508
01:16:51,640 --> 01:16:53,208
- [Radio] Can't get a
unit there right now.

1509
01:16:53,208 --> 01:16:56,311
There's been a rollover on the highway.

1510
01:16:56,311 --> 01:16:58,647
- [Brandon] Wait, it's an emergency.

1511
01:16:58,647 --> 01:17:00,315
There may have been some people killed,

1512
01:17:00,315 --> 01:17:03,218
and some people are missing.

1513
01:17:03,218 --> 01:17:05,454
Please send someone now. Do you copy?

1514
01:17:05,454 --> 01:17:08,056
(radio static)

1515
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:12,894
- What now?

1516
01:17:15,197 --> 01:17:18,333
- We have to go outside
and we have to find Mark.

1517
01:17:18,333 --> 01:17:20,335
- I'm not going out
there, I'm staying put.

1518
01:17:20,335 --> 01:17:21,236
You heard the cops.

1519
01:17:21,236 --> 01:17:23,138
They'll be here as soon as they can.

1520
01:17:23,138 --> 01:17:24,272
- By then we could all be dead.

1521
01:17:24,272 --> 01:17:25,540
- Look, Denise.

1522
01:17:25,540 --> 01:17:26,942
Nothing is going to happen to us

1523
01:17:26,942 --> 01:17:30,379
as long as we stick together,
and we have protection.

1524
01:17:30,379 --> 01:17:32,114
- Shoot me, I'm not going anywhere.

1525
01:17:32,114 --> 01:17:37,119
(dramatic music)
(door rattling)

1526
01:17:39,988 --> 01:17:42,491
(knocking on door)

1527
01:17:42,491 --> 01:17:45,927
- (gun clicking) Get it.

1528
01:17:59,908 --> 01:18:02,844
- You're not going to believe this.

1529
01:18:05,013 --> 01:18:05,847
- [Tracy] Oh my God.

1530
01:18:05,847 --> 01:18:06,982
Oh my God.

1531
01:18:06,982 --> 01:18:07,816
- Is he dead?

1532
01:18:07,816 --> 01:18:09,418
- I don't know.

1533
01:18:09,418 --> 01:18:10,385
- [Tracy] Oh my God.

1534
01:18:10,385 --> 01:18:12,387
- Shut up, Tracy.

1535
01:18:12,387 --> 01:18:13,588
- [Tracy] We have to get out of here.

1536
01:18:13,588 --> 01:18:15,891
We're all going to die.

1537
01:18:15,891 --> 01:18:16,725
- He's dead.

1538
01:18:16,725 --> 01:18:18,193
- Oh my God, we're all going to die.

1539
01:18:18,193 --> 01:18:19,728
- Will you shut the fuck up?

1540
01:18:19,728 --> 01:18:20,996
(Tracy squealing)

1541
01:18:20,996 --> 01:18:23,965
(knocking on door)

1542
01:18:32,340 --> 01:18:34,376
- This is some fucked up shit right here.

1543
01:18:34,376 --> 01:18:36,311
- [Tracy] Don't get it.

1544
01:18:37,879 --> 01:18:38,880
- Who is it?

1545
01:18:40,816 --> 01:18:41,850
- [Man Behind Door] Son, it's the sheriff.

1546
01:18:41,850 --> 01:18:42,984
Open the door.

1547
01:18:42,984 --> 01:18:44,219
- [Tracy] Oh, thank God.

1548
01:18:44,219 --> 01:18:45,620
- No, wait a minute. Think.

1549
01:18:45,620 --> 01:18:46,455
- [Tracy] Open it.

1550
01:18:46,455 --> 01:18:48,724
- What if it's not the sheriff?

1551
01:18:48,724 --> 01:18:49,791
- Uh, sir.

1552
01:18:49,791 --> 01:18:53,295
Could you please come to the
window and show us your badge?

1553
01:18:53,295 --> 01:18:54,629
- [Man Behind Door]
Okay, son, open the door.

1554
01:18:54,629 --> 01:18:56,498
You know I've got other
things to do today.

1555
01:18:56,498 --> 01:18:57,733
- Open the mother fucking door.

1556
01:18:57,733 --> 01:18:58,667
- Look, you stupid bitch.

1557
01:18:58,667 --> 01:19:00,135
If it's a cop, we'll find out in a minute.

1558
01:19:00,135 --> 01:19:02,204
If not, we don't open the door.

1559
01:19:02,204 --> 01:19:04,840
- Look, sir, we've been attacked tonight

1560
01:19:04,840 --> 01:19:06,274
and I'm sure you're going to understand,

1561
01:19:06,274 --> 01:19:07,375
when it's all said and done,

1562
01:19:07,375 --> 01:19:09,144
but right now we need you

1563
01:19:09,144 --> 01:19:12,547
to come to the window
and let us make sure.

1564
01:19:12,547 --> 01:19:16,118
- [Man Behind Door] All
right, have it your way.

1565
01:19:16,118 --> 01:19:19,788
- Tracy, go to the
fucking window and look.

1566
01:19:19,788 --> 01:19:20,956
- I can't see.

1567
01:19:22,424 --> 01:19:23,258
- [Denise] What is it?

1568
01:19:23,258 --> 01:19:24,092
(dramatic music)

1569
01:19:24,092 --> 01:19:24,926
- [Tracy] Oh my God.

1570
01:19:24,926 --> 01:19:26,561
- [Clown] Hi.

1571
01:19:26,561 --> 01:19:28,230
Open the God damn door.

1572
01:19:28,230 --> 01:19:29,064
(girls screaming)

1573
01:19:29,064 --> 01:19:29,898
- I have a gun.

1574
01:19:29,898 --> 01:19:32,100
- [Clown] Well, why don't you
stick the gun up your ass?

1575
01:19:32,100 --> 01:19:33,468
(banging on door)

1576
01:19:33,468 --> 01:19:35,670
Welcome to hell, mother fucker.

1577
01:19:35,670 --> 01:19:38,273
(gun shooting)

1578
01:19:40,308 --> 01:19:41,309
- [Tracy] What happened?

1579
01:19:41,309 --> 01:19:42,410
- Did I get him?

1580
01:19:42,410 --> 01:19:43,245
- [Tracy] I don't know.

1581
01:19:43,245 --> 01:19:45,180
- Well go fucking look.

1582
01:19:46,848 --> 01:19:47,883
- Nothing.

1583
01:19:47,883 --> 01:19:48,917
- Tracy?

1584
01:19:48,917 --> 01:19:51,686
- [Tracy] I don't know,
I don't see anything.

1585
01:19:51,686 --> 01:19:53,288
What are we going to do?

1586
01:19:53,288 --> 01:19:54,623
- I say we make a stand right here.

1587
01:19:54,623 --> 01:19:55,924
- [Tracy] Oh my God. (sobbing)

1588
01:19:55,924 --> 01:19:56,925
Oh my God.

1589
01:19:56,925 --> 01:19:58,627
- [Brandon] Tracy?

1590
01:19:58,627 --> 01:20:00,095
Tracy.

1591
01:20:00,095 --> 01:20:01,296
Tracy, Tracey, look at me.

1592
01:20:01,296 --> 01:20:02,197
Look at me.

1593
01:20:02,197 --> 01:20:03,298
Look at me.

1594
01:20:03,298 --> 01:20:04,132
Look, look, look.

1595
01:20:04,132 --> 01:20:05,133
This is my fault.

1596
01:20:05,133 --> 01:20:07,669
I got you into this and I
am going to get you out.

1597
01:20:07,669 --> 01:20:09,838
Do you understand that?
(Tracy crying)

1598
01:20:09,838 --> 01:20:10,906
Shh...

1599
01:20:10,906 --> 01:20:12,274
- Not if you keep hugging each other.

1600
01:20:12,274 --> 01:20:13,508
- Oh, fuck you.

1601
01:20:15,710 --> 01:20:18,380
- No, she's right, Brandon.

1602
01:20:18,380 --> 01:20:20,315
We have to get started.

1603
01:20:21,283 --> 01:20:22,117
- Right, okay.

1604
01:20:22,117 --> 01:20:23,118
Too many fucking windows up here,

1605
01:20:23,118 --> 01:20:25,086
so I say we block off
a section in the back,

1606
01:20:25,086 --> 01:20:27,189
- Block it off with what?

1607
01:20:29,424 --> 01:20:31,893
- We've got boards all over here.

1608
01:20:31,893 --> 01:20:34,129
Come on, come on.

1609
01:20:34,129 --> 01:20:36,231
- What are we going to do about Mark?

1610
01:20:36,231 --> 01:20:38,300
- [Brandon] There's nothing
we can do for him now.

1611
01:20:38,300 --> 01:20:39,301
Come on, go.

1612
01:20:43,872 --> 01:20:47,175
(upbeat music)

1613
01:20:47,175 --> 01:20:48,009
All right.

1614
01:20:52,180 --> 01:20:53,682
Put this board up.

1615
01:20:55,116 --> 01:20:55,951
Oh, geez.

1616
01:21:37,525 --> 01:21:40,228
What are you going to do with that?

1617
01:21:40,228 --> 01:21:44,132
- I'm going to be ready
for that mother fucker.

1618
01:21:48,136 --> 01:21:51,139
(suspenseful music)

1619
01:21:52,440 --> 01:21:53,375
(light switching)

1620
01:21:53,375 --> 01:21:54,709
(women screaming)

1621
01:21:54,709 --> 01:21:55,577
Hey shut up, quiet.

1622
01:21:55,577 --> 01:21:58,280
He just cut the electricity.

1623
01:21:58,280 --> 01:22:00,115
I've got a flashlight.

1624
01:22:07,355 --> 01:22:08,189
Are you okay?

1625
01:22:08,189 --> 01:22:09,524
- [Denise] Yeah.

1626
01:22:10,625 --> 01:22:11,459
- [Brandon] Are you okay?

1627
01:22:11,459 --> 01:22:12,694
- [Tracy] Yeah.

1628
01:22:12,694 --> 01:22:16,898
- [Brandon] Hey, come here, I
have some candles over here.

1629
01:22:16,898 --> 01:22:17,732
Hold that.

1630
01:22:22,437 --> 01:22:25,340
(mysterious music)

1631
01:23:24,332 --> 01:23:25,400
(footsteps)

1632
01:23:25,400 --> 01:23:26,401
(knocking on door)

1633
01:23:26,401 --> 01:23:27,736
- What was that?

1634
01:23:29,738 --> 01:23:31,406
- He's in the house.

1635
01:23:32,574 --> 01:23:33,408
- Fuck this.

1636
01:23:33,408 --> 01:23:34,676
I'm ready to go on the attack.

1637
01:23:34,676 --> 01:23:35,510
- No.

1638
01:23:37,012 --> 01:23:39,114
- It might be our only chance
of getting out of here alive.

1639
01:23:39,114 --> 01:23:42,784
- But we don't know what's out there.

1640
01:23:42,784 --> 01:23:44,452
- I know what's out there.

1641
01:23:44,452 --> 01:23:45,954
A fucking psychopath.

1642
01:23:45,954 --> 01:23:47,055
- Hey.

1643
01:23:47,055 --> 01:23:48,423
We don't go out there and fight something

1644
01:23:48,423 --> 01:23:49,991
until we don't have a choice.

1645
01:23:49,991 --> 01:23:50,825
She's right.

1646
01:23:50,825 --> 01:23:51,960
We don't know what's out there.

1647
01:23:51,960 --> 01:23:54,129
- All right, then what?

1648
01:23:54,129 --> 01:23:56,297
(sighing)

1649
01:23:58,633 --> 01:24:00,301
- I've got to go for help.

1650
01:24:00,301 --> 01:24:01,569
- Brandon, no.

1651
01:24:01,569 --> 01:24:04,172
You said it yourself, we're
12 miles away from anything.

1652
01:24:04,172 --> 01:24:05,740
- Look, I don't have a choice.

1653
01:24:05,740 --> 01:24:08,176
- How long would it take you?

1654
01:24:09,177 --> 01:24:10,612
- I don't know.

1655
01:24:10,612 --> 01:24:12,781
15 minutes a mile, times 12,

1656
01:24:12,781 --> 01:24:14,015
three hours?

1657
01:24:14,015 --> 01:24:15,550
- There's no way.

1658
01:24:15,550 --> 01:24:17,285
- Look, I don't have a choice, Tracy.

1659
01:24:17,285 --> 01:24:18,219
- He's right.

1660
01:24:18,219 --> 01:24:21,356
Getting help is the only chance we've got.

1661
01:24:21,356 --> 01:24:24,059
- Well, how are you going to get out?

1662
01:24:24,059 --> 01:24:27,062
(suspenseful music)

1663
01:24:30,465 --> 01:24:32,267
- Create a diversion.

1664
01:24:32,267 --> 01:24:35,203
We make enough noise
to draw his attention,

1665
01:24:35,203 --> 01:24:36,504
and then we get one of the doors open,

1666
01:24:36,504 --> 01:24:38,606
and then I make a run for it.

1667
01:24:38,606 --> 01:24:40,942
- But we don't know how many
of them there are out there.

1668
01:24:40,942 --> 01:24:42,410
- There's only one out there.

1669
01:24:42,410 --> 01:24:43,344
- How do you know?

1670
01:24:43,344 --> 01:24:46,781
- Because two doors haven't
rattled at the same time.

1671
01:24:46,781 --> 01:24:48,049
- That's right.

1672
01:24:49,350 --> 01:24:50,618
Oh look, fuck this.

1673
01:24:50,618 --> 01:24:52,020
I mean, we can sit here
and argue all night,

1674
01:24:52,020 --> 01:24:54,556
but at some point I've got
to make a break for it.

1675
01:24:54,556 --> 01:24:57,392
- Brandon, no, please don't do this.

1676
01:24:57,392 --> 01:24:59,461
- Look, Tracy, I have to.

1677
01:25:00,995 --> 01:25:01,830
Okay.

1678
01:25:01,830 --> 01:25:03,264
Here's what we're going to do.

1679
01:25:03,264 --> 01:25:06,901
Denise, be ready to open that door.

1680
01:25:06,901 --> 01:25:09,838
Okay, Tracy, When I give you the nod,

1681
01:25:09,838 --> 01:25:11,906
you rattle this and
caused the distraction.

1682
01:25:11,906 --> 01:25:16,311
And you, you make sure that
you're ready to open that door.

1683
01:25:16,311 --> 01:25:17,145
- Okay.

1684
01:25:17,145 --> 01:25:18,947
- Take this.

1685
01:25:18,947 --> 01:25:20,415
- You may need it out there.

1686
01:25:20,415 --> 01:25:24,085
- Now look, once I get
out you lock this door,

1687
01:25:24,085 --> 01:25:28,423
and no matter what happens,
you do not open it.

1688
01:25:28,423 --> 01:25:29,557
- Don't worry about us.

1689
01:25:29,557 --> 01:25:30,525
We'll be fine.

1690
01:25:30,525 --> 01:25:32,427
You just run like hell.

1691
01:25:33,461 --> 01:25:35,296
- Don't worry, I will.

1692
01:25:36,164 --> 01:25:37,432
Here.

1693
01:25:37,432 --> 01:25:38,266
- Careful Brandon.

1694
01:25:38,266 --> 01:25:39,334
- Oh, I will.

1695
01:25:40,335 --> 01:25:41,503
- Oh, God.

1696
01:25:41,503 --> 01:25:43,505
(rattling door)

1697
01:25:43,505 --> 01:25:46,508
(suspenseful music)

1698
01:25:48,109 --> 01:25:50,445
(footsteps)

1699
01:25:54,149 --> 01:25:56,050
(Tracy screaming)

1700
01:25:56,050 --> 01:25:58,720
(door rattling)

1701
01:26:01,789 --> 01:26:02,624
- Open it.

1702
01:26:02,624 --> 01:26:05,460
(clown laughing)

1703
01:26:12,066 --> 01:26:14,502
- [Clown] Oh please, oh please.

1704
01:26:14,502 --> 01:26:16,404
Let me come in.

1705
01:26:16,404 --> 01:26:19,440
Or I'll huff, and I'll puff,

1706
01:26:19,440 --> 01:26:22,043
and I'll blow the house in.

1707
01:26:22,043 --> 01:26:24,746
(clown laughing)

1708
01:26:24,746 --> 01:26:27,415
(nursery music)

1709
01:26:37,659 --> 01:26:40,495
(Brandon panting)

1710
01:27:04,085 --> 01:27:06,554
- What if he doesn't make it?

1711
01:27:06,554 --> 01:27:07,488
- We fight.

1712
01:27:08,656 --> 01:27:11,759
- I guess we have no choice.

1713
01:27:11,759 --> 01:27:12,594
- Here.

1714
01:27:13,528 --> 01:27:14,996
- Great.

1715
01:27:14,996 --> 01:27:16,264
Some weekend.

1716
01:27:16,264 --> 01:27:20,268
- (scoffing) Yeah, some weekend.

1717
01:27:20,268 --> 01:27:22,704
(dramatic music)
(women screaming)

1718
01:27:22,704 --> 01:27:25,873
(door rattling)

1719
01:27:25,873 --> 01:27:27,208
- Get ready, Tracy, I need you.

1720
01:27:27,208 --> 01:27:29,877
- Why don't you leave us alone?

1721
01:27:31,579 --> 01:27:32,780
- It's okay, Tracy, calm down.

1722
01:27:32,780 --> 01:27:34,048
- I can't take this anymore.

1723
01:27:34,048 --> 01:27:35,116
- Calm down.

1724
01:27:35,116 --> 01:27:37,685
- Why don't you just do
what you're going to do?

1725
01:27:37,685 --> 01:27:38,519
(Tracy crying)

1726
01:27:38,519 --> 01:27:39,721
(clown laughing)

1727
01:27:39,721 --> 01:27:41,122
(women screaming)

1728
01:27:41,122 --> 01:27:42,056
- Oh my God.

1729
01:27:42,056 --> 01:27:42,890
Shit.

1730
01:27:48,296 --> 01:27:50,565
- It's okay, it's gone now.

1731
01:27:51,432 --> 01:27:52,433
- Oh my God.

1732
01:27:53,635 --> 01:27:55,003
- What?

1733
01:27:55,003 --> 01:27:56,838
- This means there are two of them.

1734
01:27:56,838 --> 01:27:58,973
What If Brandon doesn't make it?

1735
01:27:58,973 --> 01:28:00,408
- We don't know that
Brandon didn't make it.

1736
01:28:00,408 --> 01:28:01,342
- But what if he doesn't?

1737
01:28:01,342 --> 01:28:02,710
What are we going to do?

1738
01:28:02,710 --> 01:28:03,845
What are we going to do now?

1739
01:28:03,845 --> 01:28:04,846
What are we going to do?

1740
01:28:04,846 --> 01:28:05,880
- Can it, look.

1741
01:28:05,880 --> 01:28:07,348
We've got to stick together, okay?

1742
01:28:07,348 --> 01:28:09,784
Our only chance is sticking together.

1743
01:28:09,784 --> 01:28:10,785
- Oh God.

1744
01:28:10,785 --> 01:28:11,786
You hurt me.

1745
01:28:12,620 --> 01:28:15,857
- I'm sorry, but you're
acting like a fucking idiot.

1746
01:28:15,857 --> 01:28:17,058
- I'm sorry.

1747
01:28:17,058 --> 01:28:18,226
I guess I'm just not used to

1748
01:28:18,226 --> 01:28:20,128
being trapped in a secluded house,

1749
01:28:20,128 --> 01:28:22,030
with a fucking psychopath.

1750
01:28:22,030 --> 01:28:23,131
- Me neither.

1751
01:28:26,301 --> 01:28:27,135
- Okay.

1752
01:28:28,036 --> 01:28:29,604
Fuck it.

1753
01:28:29,604 --> 01:28:32,006
Come first light, we're
going out that door

1754
01:28:32,006 --> 01:28:33,941
and dealing with whatever's out there.

1755
01:28:33,941 --> 01:28:35,843
I can't take it in this room much longer.

1756
01:28:35,843 --> 01:28:37,845
If we get it, we get it.

1757
01:28:39,380 --> 01:28:40,214
- Okay.

1758
01:28:41,215 --> 01:28:43,551
It's going to be light soon.

1759
01:28:51,492 --> 01:28:56,497
(birds chirping)
(calming music)

1760
01:29:11,279 --> 01:29:14,015
(Tracy groaning)

1761
01:29:20,154 --> 01:29:21,956
- What happened?

1762
01:29:21,956 --> 01:29:24,759
- Nothing, you fell asleep.

1763
01:29:24,759 --> 01:29:26,260
- What time is it?

1764
01:29:27,261 --> 01:29:29,497
- I don't know, around six.

1765
01:29:31,532 --> 01:29:33,067
Do you still want to go out?

1766
01:29:33,067 --> 01:29:33,901
- What do you think?

1767
01:29:33,901 --> 01:29:35,570
- I asked you first.

1768
01:29:36,804 --> 01:29:37,872
- Yeah, I do.

1769
01:29:39,040 --> 01:29:39,874
- Me too.

1770
01:29:41,509 --> 01:29:44,178
- Have you gotten any
sleep at all tonight?

1771
01:29:44,178 --> 01:29:45,646
- No.

1772
01:29:45,646 --> 01:29:49,150
- Why don't we give Brandon like, an hour?

1773
01:29:51,719 --> 01:29:53,588
- He's not coming, believe me.

1774
01:29:53,588 --> 01:29:55,490
- How do you know that?

1775
01:29:59,227 --> 01:30:00,995
- Take this.

1776
01:30:00,995 --> 01:30:03,564
- I have to go to the bathroom.

1777
01:30:06,534 --> 01:30:08,369
- Leave the door open.

1778
01:30:17,044 --> 01:30:18,946
(door slamming)
(suspenseful music)

1779
01:30:18,946 --> 01:30:20,581
(Denise screaming)

1780
01:30:20,581 --> 01:30:21,716
- [Denise] Help.

1781
01:30:21,716 --> 01:30:22,850
Tracy, help.

1782
01:30:22,850 --> 01:30:24,085
- Denise?

1783
01:30:24,085 --> 01:30:25,420
Denise?

1784
01:30:25,420 --> 01:30:27,155
(Denise screaming)

1785
01:30:27,155 --> 01:30:29,590
Denise? Open the door.

1786
01:30:29,590 --> 01:30:32,960
(door opening)

1787
01:30:32,960 --> 01:30:34,729
Brandon, oh my God.

1788
01:30:34,729 --> 01:30:36,731
- Shh, it's over, Tracy.

1789
01:30:38,599 --> 01:30:39,434
Shh, shh.

1790
01:30:41,469 --> 01:30:42,970
- I was so scared.

1791
01:30:44,005 --> 01:30:45,740
- [Brandon] Shh, shh.

1792
01:30:52,780 --> 01:30:54,482
(clown laughing)

1793
01:30:54,482 --> 01:30:56,584
- Brandon, what the hell?

1794
01:31:00,188 --> 01:31:01,155
- Give me the gun, Tracy.

1795
01:31:01,155 --> 01:31:02,323
- No.
- It's over, come on.

1796
01:31:02,323 --> 01:31:03,291
- No, stay away from me.

1797
01:31:03,291 --> 01:31:05,159
No, what the hell is
going on here, Brandon?

1798
01:31:05,159 --> 01:31:05,993
- [Denise] What the hell.

1799
01:31:05,993 --> 01:31:07,428
You said this was your family's place.

1800
01:31:07,428 --> 01:31:08,796
- Brandon, it's your house.

1801
01:31:08,796 --> 01:31:10,031
- Who do you think did it, Tracy?

1802
01:31:10,031 --> 01:31:11,299
Brandon, Brandon did.

1803
01:31:11,299 --> 01:31:13,501
- Oh, you stay the fuck away from me.

1804
01:31:13,501 --> 01:31:14,702
- I'd listened to her, uncle Billy.

1805
01:31:14,702 --> 01:31:16,270
She's got a gun.

1806
01:31:16,270 --> 01:31:17,705
Come on now, give me the gun.

1807
01:31:17,705 --> 01:31:19,073
- What the hell is going on here?

1808
01:31:19,073 --> 01:31:20,007
- Well, it's a game.

1809
01:31:20,007 --> 01:31:21,676
After the pagan orgy,

1810
01:31:21,676 --> 01:31:22,510
(Tracy yelping)

1811
01:31:22,510 --> 01:31:23,344
orgy,

1812
01:31:23,344 --> 01:31:25,613
I feed everybody to a
monster in the woods.

1813
01:31:25,613 --> 01:31:28,082
It's a game we've been
playing for quite a while.

1814
01:31:28,082 --> 01:31:29,250
Well, actually they've been playing.

1815
01:31:29,250 --> 01:31:30,351
I just start it.

1816
01:31:30,351 --> 01:31:31,719
- Who's they?

1817
01:31:31,719 --> 01:31:34,789
- [Tracy] My mom, my dad, and now me.

1818
01:31:36,190 --> 01:31:37,024
(Tracy yelping)

1819
01:31:37,024 --> 01:31:38,092
Thirsty?

1820
01:31:38,092 --> 01:31:38,926
Me too.

1821
01:31:39,961 --> 01:31:41,429
(nursery music)

1822
01:31:41,429 --> 01:31:42,964
- Denise?

1823
01:31:42,964 --> 01:31:44,465
- What's up, Trace?

1824
01:31:44,465 --> 01:31:46,100
- Oh my God.

1825
01:31:46,100 --> 01:31:49,170
- Brandon, how could you have
killed all of those people?

1826
01:31:49,170 --> 01:31:50,004
- What people?

1827
01:31:50,004 --> 01:31:51,072
Are you talking about Mark?

1828
01:31:51,072 --> 01:31:52,139
He was a pussy.

1829
01:31:52,139 --> 01:31:54,509
- (yelling) Susan.

1830
01:31:54,509 --> 01:31:56,777
- Maybe the boogeyman got her? Woo.

1831
01:31:56,777 --> 01:31:58,713
- This is what's wrong.

1832
01:31:58,713 --> 01:32:01,182
(Billy laughing)

1833
01:32:01,182 --> 01:32:02,116
- Come on, come on.

1834
01:32:02,116 --> 01:32:03,751
Oh, oh, come on.

1835
01:32:03,751 --> 01:32:04,619
- Fuck you, Brandon.

1836
01:32:04,619 --> 01:32:05,520
- Give me the gun, give me the gun.

1837
01:32:05,520 --> 01:32:06,487
- Fuck you, Brandon.

1838
01:32:06,487 --> 01:32:09,056
(gun shooting)

1839
01:32:10,791 --> 01:32:13,995
(Tracy crying)

1840
01:32:13,995 --> 01:32:17,265
- Fuck yeah, I told you
she'd pull the trigger.

1841
01:32:17,265 --> 01:32:18,099
Oh, yes.

1842
01:32:19,200 --> 01:32:23,304
- You think we'd give you a
gun with bullets in it, bitch?

1843
01:32:23,304 --> 01:32:25,706
Swear to God, babe, I
hated that you fucked her.

1844
01:32:25,706 --> 01:32:27,241
- [Brandon] Mmm, are you jealous?

1845
01:32:27,241 --> 01:32:28,409
- Not anymore.

1846
01:32:31,012 --> 01:32:31,879
(Tracy screaming)

1847
01:32:31,879 --> 01:32:32,713
- [Tracy] Oh no.

1848
01:32:32,713 --> 01:32:34,615
(Tracy screaming)

1849
01:32:34,615 --> 01:32:35,449
Oh no.

1850
01:32:37,585 --> 01:32:38,753
No, oh my God.

1851
01:32:40,621 --> 01:32:42,423
No, put me down.

1852
01:32:42,423 --> 01:32:43,658
(clapping)

1853
01:32:43,658 --> 01:32:45,927
- See you later for dinner.

1854
01:32:49,130 --> 01:32:52,667
(sighing of relief)

1855
01:32:52,667 --> 01:32:55,903
(upbeat, cheery music)

1856
01:33:06,881 --> 01:33:07,715
M?

1857
01:33:08,716 --> 01:33:09,550
David.

1858
01:33:09,550 --> 01:33:14,055
I would like to apologize
for what happened on Friday.

1859
01:33:15,356 --> 01:33:16,457
