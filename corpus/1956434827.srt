3
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:37,357
[Ed] It was a big mistake
acknowledging this doll.

4
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:38,125
And through that,

5
00:00:38,127 --> 00:00:39,759
the inhuman spirit
tricked you.

6
00:00:39,761 --> 00:00:42,496
You gave it permission
to infest your lives.

00:00:42,498 --> 00:00:44,798
[nurse 1]
What's an inhuman spirit?

8
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:45,866
[Ed] It's something
that's never

9
00:00:45,868 --> 00:00:48,668
walked the earth
in human form.

10
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:50,170
It's something demonic.

11
00:00:50,172 --> 00:00:53,573
[nurse 2] So,
the doll was never possessed?

12
00:00:53,575 --> 00:00:56,477
[Lorraine] No,
it was used as a conduit.

13
00:00:56,479 --> 00:00:59,346
It was moved around to give
the impression of possession.

14
00:00:59,348 --> 00:01:02,149
Demonic spirits
don't possess things.

15
00:01:02,151 --> 00:01:04,218
They possess people.

16
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:06,620
It wanted to
get inside of you.

17
00:01:06,622 --> 00:01:09,723
And given
this unusual feature,

18
00:01:09,725 --> 00:01:12,325
the doll will need to be
properly cared for.

19
00:01:12,327 --> 00:01:13,727
- Cared for?
- [Ed] Mmm-hmm.

20
00:01:13,729 --> 00:01:15,398
It should be destroyed.

21
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:20,801
That would
only make things worse.

22
00:01:20,803 --> 00:01:23,239
We think it best
the doll come with us.

23
00:01:24,672 --> 00:01:26,873
We'll keep it somewhere safe.

24
00:01:26,875 --> 00:01:29,376
That sounds like
a great idea.

25
00:01:29,378 --> 00:01:30,712

Eh, about an hour.

we might end up in California.

so nice, Ed.

43
00:02:14,789 --> 00:02:16,425
We should plan on it.

Nothing.

it's right over here.

195
00:16:14,295 --> 00:16:15,297
Let me show you.

196
00:16:18,032 --> 00:16:19,098
How could you not tell me

197
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:20,266
what the Warrens did
for a living?

198
00:16:20,268 --> 00:16:21,767
Shouldn't you be
in math class?

199
00:16:21,769 --> 00:16:23,368
Mary Ellen!

200
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:25,371
I babysat the Smiths
for over two years

201
00:16:25,373 --> 00:16:26,572
and never told you
what they did.

202
00:16:26,574 --> 00:16:28,141
Oh, what do they do?

203
00:16:28,143 --> 00:16:29,541
They're podiatrists.

204
00:16:29,543 --> 00:16:31,209
- So not the same.
- [chuckles]

205
00:16:31,211 --> 00:16:33,212
Well, obviously,
I'm coming over later.

206
00:16:33,214 --> 00:16:34,679
We do have
that social studies project

- Uh...

208

We don't have any project.

209
00:16:37,786 --> 00:16:39,220
Okay, but how would
they know?

00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:41,120
She's psychic.

211
00:16:41,122 --> 00:16:43,256
Then, they're heroes.

212
00:16:43,258 --> 00:16:44,823
I think
they're concerned parents

213
00:16:44,825 --> 00:16:46,324

negative influences

214
00:16:46,326 --> 00:16:47,459

00:16:47,461 --> 00:16:49,127

So, what's it like

Is it all creepy music
and cobwebs?

220

No. No, it's boring suburbia.

221

of your locker is scarier.

and why wasn't I invited?

get you nowhere.

You wouldn't.

00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:25,231

- I think so.
- Oh, cool.

You live near the Warrens,
don't you, Bob?

Yeah, Mary Ellen's babysitting

Yeah. Yeah, I live
right across the street.

Mrs. Faley went ahead

251
00:18:04,606 --> 00:18:07,139
and dropped a can
of tomato sauce in aisle five,

252
00:18:07,141 --> 00:18:10,276
and it looks like a crime
scene, so get the mop.

everything okay?

- Mmm-hmm.
- Yes, sir.

any trouble, is he?

- [chuckles] No.
- No.

But I only ever used them once
'cause I broke my arm

358
00:23:02,669 --> 00:23:04,669
the first time I put them on.

359
00:23:04,671 --> 00:23:05,805
You're kidding.

360
00:23:05,807 --> 00:23:08,706
She looks
way more coordinated.

361
00:23:08,708 --> 00:23:10,142
They're gonna ruin the floors.

362
00:23:10,144 --> 00:23:12,478
Can we go around
the block, then?

363
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,180
- I don't think...
- [Daniela] Good idea.

364
00:23:14,182 --> 00:23:15,280
You guys go.

365
00:23:15,282 --> 00:23:17,386
I'll watch the cake
and make sure it doesn't burn.

366
00:23:18,886 --> 00:23:21,587
Fine. But don't snoop.
Don't touch.

367
00:23:21,589 --> 00:23:23,521
Don't do anything. Please?

368
00:23:23,523 --> 00:23:25,494
Stay in the kitchen.
Promise me.

369
00:23:25,993 --> 00:23:27,162
I promise.

370
00:24:02,196 --> 00:24:03,564
[sighs]

371
00:24:04,698 --> 00:24:05,766
[scoffs]

372
00:24:07,568 --> 00:24:08,901
Fuck it.

373
00:24:08,903 --> 00:24:11,740
I am calling out to the
spirits on the other side.

374
00:24:12,807 --> 00:24:14,976
Please unlock this door
and let me in.

375
00:24:28,188 --> 00:24:29,621
[sighs]

376
00:24:29,623 --> 00:24:30,791
Shit.

377
00:24:32,025 --> 00:24:33,093
[sighs]

378
00:24:43,236 --> 00:24:44,605
[sighs]

379
00:24:46,773 --> 00:24:48,642
[door creaking]

380
00:25:12,332 --> 00:25:13,869
[door creaking]

381
00:25:56,209 --> 00:25:57,711
Please don't judge me.

382
00:25:59,946 --> 00:26:01,015
[scoffs]

383
00:26:01,648 --> 00:26:02,716
Amen.

384
00:26:17,197 --> 00:26:19,066
[door creaking]

385
00:26:21,869 --> 00:26:23,071
Whoa.

386
00:26:27,007 --> 00:26:28,175
[exhales]

387
00:26:33,813 --> 00:26:34,815
Whoa.

388
00:27:52,926 --> 00:27:54,995
What'd you do
to get in there?

389
00:27:58,232 --> 00:27:59,768
[tapping]

390
00:28:25,259 --> 00:28:26,428
[chuckles softly]

391
00:28:26,961 --> 00:28:28,830
[clicking]

392
00:29:16,310 --> 00:29:17,846
[notes playing]

393
00:29:57,484 --> 00:30:00,021
If there is a presence here
in this room,

394
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,924
please give me a sign.

395
00:30:07,927 --> 00:30:09,129
Any sign at all.

396
00:30:14,901 --> 00:30:15,969
Dad?

397
00:30:27,113 --> 00:30:28,182
[scoffs]

398
00:30:28,882 --> 00:30:29,883
This is stupid.

399
00:30:33,486 --> 00:30:34,555
[sniffles]

400
00:30:39,426 --> 00:30:40,494
[thuds]

401
00:32:09,416 --> 00:32:11,549
[alarm beeping]

402
00:32:11,551 --> 00:32:12,552
Shit.

403
00:32:15,723 --> 00:32:17,591
[muffled beeping]

404
00:32:27,368 --> 00:32:28,436
[thuds]

405
00:32:40,246 --> 00:32:41,581
[beeping continues]

406
00:32:43,751 --> 00:32:45,019
[door closes]

407
00:32:46,285 --> 00:32:48,220
You burnt the cake? Daniela.

408
00:32:48,222 --> 00:32:49,754
[sighs] Only the top.

409
00:32:49,756 --> 00:32:52,089
Just put frosting on it.

410
00:32:52,091 --> 00:32:53,558
She'll never know.

411
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:54,592
How'd it go with the skates?

412
00:32:54,594 --> 00:32:56,228
She loved them until she fell
on the way back

413
00:32:56,230 --> 00:32:57,695
and skinned her knee.

414
00:32:57,697 --> 00:32:59,263
Better than breaking her arm.

415
00:32:59,265 --> 00:33:00,464
Where is she anyway?

416
00:33:00,466 --> 00:33:02,634
She's out
feeding the chickens.

417
00:33:02,636 --> 00:33:04,469
They have chickens?

418
00:33:04,471 --> 00:33:06,007
[chickens clucking]

419
00:33:08,408 --> 00:33:09,676
[Daniela] Hey. How's your knee?

420
00:33:10,276 --> 00:33:11,443
Oh. [exclaims]

421
00:33:11,445 --> 00:33:14,613
Looks like your jeans will
at least need some stitches.

422
00:33:14,615 --> 00:33:15,746
It's okay.

423
00:33:15,748 --> 00:33:17,184
Accidents happen.

424
00:33:21,754 --> 00:33:23,224
So, are you scared yet?

425
00:33:24,291 --> 00:33:26,258
Scared? What? No.

426
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:28,059
Who says they're scared?

427
00:33:28,061 --> 00:33:30,127
Kids in my class.

428
00:33:30,129 --> 00:33:31,829
Anthony Rios started it.

429
00:33:31,831 --> 00:33:33,165
I hate him.

430
00:33:33,167 --> 00:33:35,570
Wait. Tony Rios started it?

431
00:33:36,369 --> 00:33:38,039
Do you know him?

432
00:33:38,571 --> 00:33:41,373
Yeah, he's my brother.

433
00:33:41,375 --> 00:33:44,475
Anthony Rios is your brother?

434
00:33:44,477 --> 00:33:46,744
Yeah, I know.
Don't hold it against me.

435
00:33:46,746 --> 00:33:49,213
I don't like him either.

436
00:33:49,215 --> 00:33:51,119
You know,
he still wets the bed.

437
00:33:51,784 --> 00:33:53,585
You didn't hear it from me.

438
00:33:53,587 --> 00:33:55,289
Or maybe you did,
I don't care.

439
00:33:55,855 --> 00:33:57,521
Still, just...

440
00:33:57,523 --> 00:33:59,226
go a little easy on him.

441
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:02,230
It's been a tough year.

442
00:34:05,398 --> 00:34:08,101
You lost somebody,
didn't you?

443
00:34:09,770 --> 00:34:11,371
My dad. Uh...

444
00:34:12,172 --> 00:34:14,108
Did Mary Ellen tell you?

445
00:34:15,409 --> 00:34:16,511
No.

446
00:34:17,377 --> 00:34:18,612
I just knew.

447
00:34:20,746 --> 00:34:22,880
- Um, for delivery.
- [song playing on record]

448
00:34:22,882 --> 00:34:25,717
Could I do one large, please?

449
00:34:25,719 --> 00:34:29,190
Um, it's gonna be
3506 Wayman Street.

450
00:34:30,357 --> 00:34:32,092
Oh, perfect. Thank you.

451
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:36,261
[doorbell rings]

452
00:34:36,263 --> 00:34:37,895
Coming.

453
00:34:37,897 --> 00:34:40,331
[doorbell ringing repeatedly]

454
00:34:40,333 --> 00:34:41,835
[quietly] Hold your horses.

455
00:34:43,436 --> 00:34:44,605
[banging on door]

456
00:34:51,377 --> 00:34:52,612
Who is it?

457
00:34:53,246 --> 00:34:54,581
[doorbell rings]

458
00:34:58,451 --> 00:34:59,786
Hello?

459
00:35:01,455 --> 00:35:02,790
Daniela?

460
00:35:11,397 --> 00:35:12,833
[girl] Is Annabelle there?

461
00:35:20,674 --> 00:35:22,373
Who?

462
00:35:22,375 --> 00:35:24,511
[girl] Can Annabelle
come out to play?

463
00:35:38,625 --> 00:35:39,858
I think you have
the wrong house.

464
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:41,562
There's no Annabelle here.

465
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:45,797
Yes, she is.

466
00:35:45,799 --> 00:35:47,835
She's right behind you.

467
00:35:50,938 --> 00:35:52,807
- [girl giggling]
- [footsteps running away]

468
00:35:58,779 --> 00:36:01,645
People are just...
They're really weird about death.

469
00:36:01,647 --> 00:36:03,915
That's probably why the kids
pick on you at school.

470
00:36:03,917 --> 00:36:05,817
It scares them.

471
00:36:05,819 --> 00:36:08,286
They treat it like it's some
disease they don't wanna get,

472
00:36:08,288 --> 00:36:10,157
even though
everyone already has it.

473
00:36:11,225 --> 00:36:13,224
But here's the thing.

474
00:36:13,226 --> 00:36:14,893
I used to think
it was fatal and whammo.

475
00:36:14,895 --> 00:36:16,228
It's, like, out.

476
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:18,395
Like turning off a TV.

477
00:36:18,397 --> 00:36:19,697
Then I learned
about your parents

478
00:36:19,699 --> 00:36:20,799
and their whole exploration

479
00:36:20,801 --> 00:36:22,569
into the afterlife
and stuff...

480
00:36:24,837 --> 00:36:26,373
and they gave me hope.

481
00:36:27,873 --> 00:36:30,877
That maybe
life goes on somehow.

482
00:36:32,612 --> 00:36:33,614
Maybe...

483
00:36:34,614 --> 00:36:38,386
my darling dad
is still out there somewhere.

484
00:36:39,386 --> 00:36:40,819
"Darling dad"?

485
00:36:40,821 --> 00:36:42,621
It was a thing.

486
00:36:42,623 --> 00:36:45,626
He was darling dad,
and I was darling Daniela...

487
00:36:46,726 --> 00:36:47,795
Stupid. [chuckles]

488
00:36:49,462 --> 00:36:51,231
He's still out there,
you know.

489
00:36:52,398 --> 00:36:53,998
You think so?

490
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,936
My parents
would say he is, too.

491
00:37:16,623 --> 00:37:18,322
Where are you going?

492
00:37:18,324 --> 00:37:19,694
Be right back.

493
00:37:31,804 --> 00:37:32,973
[voice breaking] Dad?

494
00:37:50,089 --> 00:37:51,458
Daniela?

495
00:38:01,067 --> 00:38:03,000
Daniela!

496
00:38:03,002 --> 00:38:06,003
- Where did she go?
- [footsteps thudding]

497
00:38:06,005 --> 00:38:07,005
[Mary Ellen]
What are you doing?

498
00:38:07,007 --> 00:38:09,510
Daniela, you're not supposed
to go down there!

499
00:38:11,645 --> 00:38:14,014
- What are you doing?
- I thought I saw something.

500
00:38:17,016 --> 00:38:18,285
What did you see?

501
00:38:21,621 --> 00:38:23,420
Forget it. It doesn't matter.

502
00:38:23,422 --> 00:38:25,292
[wood creaking]

503
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:49,850
[creaking continues]

504
00:39:12,938 --> 00:39:14,942
[door creaking]

505
00:39:24,618 --> 00:39:25,953
[breathing shakily]

506
00:39:46,105 --> 00:39:47,808
[faint rustling]

507
00:40:10,197 --> 00:40:12,566
[door rattling]

508
00:40:17,170 --> 00:40:19,706
- [wind howling]
- [indistinct whispering]

509
00:40:29,014 --> 00:40:30,884
[rumbling]

510
00:40:48,502 --> 00:40:49,670
[bone cracks]

511
00:40:51,705 --> 00:40:53,804
[footsteps running]

512
00:40:53,806 --> 00:40:55,172
[Judy screaming]

513
00:40:55,174 --> 00:40:56,176
Judy?

514
00:41:05,118 --> 00:41:06,119
Judy?

515
00:41:11,090 --> 00:41:12,092
Judy?

516
00:41:14,828 --> 00:41:16,697
[door creaking]

517
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:21,634
Judy?

518
00:41:25,871 --> 00:41:27,672
[Judy] In thee, O Lord,
do I put my trust.

519
00:41:27,674 --> 00:41:29,273
Let me never be
put to confusion.

520
00:41:29,275 --> 00:41:31,074
Deliver me into
Thy righteousness

521
00:41:31,076 --> 00:41:32,744
and cause me to escape.
Incline Thine ear...

522
00:41:32,746 --> 00:41:34,612
[Mary Ellen]
Hey! Hey, Judy! Judy.

523
00:41:34,614 --> 00:41:36,050
What's going on? What's wrong?

524
00:41:38,018 --> 00:41:39,552
What's going on?

525
00:41:42,989 --> 00:41:44,191
What happened?

526
00:41:45,324 --> 00:41:46,493
Nothing.

527
00:41:46,826 --> 00:41:47,962
Judy...

528
00:41:50,263 --> 00:41:52,063
I just got scared.

529
00:41:52,065 --> 00:41:53,967
Scared of what?

530
00:41:57,804 --> 00:41:59,106
Sometimes...

531
00:42:00,105 --> 00:42:01,806
I see things.

532
00:42:01,808 --> 00:42:03,811
Like how my mom sees things.

533
00:42:08,081 --> 00:42:10,551
You mean like ghosts?

534
00:42:15,355 --> 00:42:17,157
Where do you see them?

535
00:42:19,125 --> 00:42:20,761
Everywhere I go.

536
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:28,168
Judy...

537
00:42:29,868 --> 00:42:32,203
Ghosts used to be people.

538
00:42:32,205 --> 00:42:34,842
And not every person
you meet is bad...

539
00:42:36,342 --> 00:42:39,679
so maybe not all ghosts
are bad, either.

540
00:42:48,121 --> 00:42:49,887
[footsteps approaching]

541
00:42:49,889 --> 00:42:50,891
Daniela.

542
00:42:52,025 --> 00:42:53,958
- You have to see this.

543
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:56,194

investigated about this girl

544

something called the Ferryman.

554

[Daniela] It was a case
the Warrens investigated

555
00:43:31,831 --> 00:43:34,068
about a hellhound that
possessed a man in England.

556
00:43:35,701 --> 00:43:37,370
He terrorized the shit
out of this town.

557
00:43:47,681 --> 00:43:49,249
What's with the coins
over their eyes?

558
00:43:50,382 --> 00:43:51,384
What?

559
00:43:53,118 --> 00:43:54,451
[Daniela] Oh, I don't know.
I didn't get that far.

560
00:43:54,453 --> 00:43:56,820
They used to put them
over the eyes of the dead

561
00:43:56,822 --> 00:43:57,889
to pay the Ferryman,
so he could

562
00:43:57,891 --> 00:43:59,824
take their souls
to the underworld.

563
00:43:59,826 --> 00:44:01,192
It was his toll.

[Daniela] Do you know
what this does, Judy?

567
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:10,703
I think it's called
a Mourner's Bracelet.

568
00:44:13,072 --> 00:44:16,176
It helps you contact
your lost loved ones.

569

- What's that?
- Um...

570
00:44:26,418 --> 00:44:29,056
It's a case my parents
investigated recently.

571
00:44:29,922 --> 00:44:31,355
The wedding dress.

572
00:44:31,357 --> 00:44:32,960
It haunts people.

573
00:44:34,027 --> 00:44:36,830
And it makes them violent.

574
00:44:38,464 --> 00:44:39,996
Where is the dress now?

575
00:44:39,998 --> 00:44:41,301
Down the hall
in the artifact room.

576
00:44:44,804 --> 00:44:47,441

all this stuff is.

Yeah.

580
00:44:52,811 --> 00:44:55,045
My dad says
that everything in there

581
00:44:55,047 --> 00:44:58,449
is either haunted, cursed,

582
00:44:58,451 --> 00:45:01,886
or used in some
ritualistic practice.

583
00:45:01,888 --> 00:45:03,320
What about the doll
that's in there?

584
00:45:03,322 --> 00:45:04,755

with your dad...

Let's find out.

605
00:46:10,022 --> 00:46:12,190
Okay. Okay,
so you draw a card

606
00:46:12,192 --> 00:46:13,491
and whatever picture
it has on it

607
00:46:13,493 --> 00:46:14,826
is the object you try to find

inside the box.

If the object you pull out
matches the picture,

00:46:18,431 --> 00:46:19,433
then you get a point.

1085
01:31:41,752 --> 01:31:44,618

[screeching]

1098
01:32:32,235 --> 01:32:34,202
Judy! Judy. Judy.

1099
01:32:34,204 --> 01:32:35,269
Get the doll!

1100
01:32:35,271 --> 01:32:36,938

[Judy] Hurry!

- [Mary Ellen straining]

Our Father who art in heaven,

Thy kingdom come,
Thy will be done,

1109
01:32:58,395 --> 01:32:59,860
on earth as it is in heaven.

1110
01:32:59,862 --> 01:33:01,261
Put her in!

1111
01:33:01,263 --> 01:33:02,997
Give us this day
our daily bread,

1112
01:33:02,999 --> 01:33:04,033
and forgive us
for our trespasses,

1113
01:33:04,035 --> 01:33:06,900
as we forgive those
who trespassed against us,

1114
01:33:06,902 --> 01:33:08,336
lead us not into temptation,

1115
01:33:08,338 --> 01:33:09,807
but deliver us from evil...

1116
01:33:12,308 --> 01:33:13,707
- [noises stop]
- [both panting]

1117
01:33:13,709 --> 01:33:14,712
Amen.

1118
01:33:23,387 --> 01:33:24,889
[stammers] Is it over?

1119
01:33:27,790 --> 01:33:29,627
The evil has been contained.

1120
01:33:31,261 --> 01:33:33,129
- [thudding]
- [all scream]

1121
01:33:35,865 --> 01:33:37,198
Bob?

1122
01:33:37,200 --> 01:33:39,967
- Are you guys okay?
- Yeah. We're okay.

1123
01:33:39,969 --> 01:33:41,869
[both panting]

1124
01:33:41,871 --> 01:33:43,070
- Are you okay?
- [Bob] No!

1125
01:33:43,072 --> 01:33:44,709
There was a werewolf outside!

1126
01:33:45,307 --> 01:33:46,944
You saw the werewolf?

1127
01:33:47,777 --> 01:33:49,243
Yeah.

1128
01:33:49,245 --> 01:33:50,947
He saved me from it.

1129
01:33:53,249 --> 01:33:54,250
You did?

1130
01:33:56,786 --> 01:33:58,353
Yeah. Yeah.

1131
01:33:58,355 --> 01:33:59,953
Kind of.

1132
01:33:59,955 --> 01:34:01,993
Maybe we should talk
about this somewhere else.

1133
01:34:26,383 --> 01:34:27,982
[man on TV] <i>Good morning
from the staff</i>

1134
01:34:27,984 --> 01:34:30,851

My parents.

1138
01:34:37,794 --> 01:34:38,993
Shit! You're not supposed
to have boys over.

1139
01:34:38,995 --> 01:34:41,061
I think that's the least of
our concerns right now, Bob.

1140
01:34:41,063 --> 01:34:42,896
Yeah, yeah. I should
probably still get going.

1141
01:34:42,898 --> 01:34:44,998
Hey, listen, um,
so Homecoming is coming up

1142
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:46,835
- and I would really like...
- Yes. I'll... I'll go.

1143
01:34:46,837 --> 01:34:47,769
With me?

1144
01:34:47,771 --> 01:34:49,903
Yes, if the Warrens
don't kill me first.

1145
01:34:49,905 --> 01:34:51,840
[breathes deeply]

1146

1148
01:34:57,947 --> 01:34:58,980
[Judy] Mom!

1149
01:34:58,982 --> 01:35:01,515
[Lorraine] Judy! What are you
doing up so early?

1150
01:35:01,517 --> 01:35:03,283
[Judy] Don't get mad...

1151
01:35:03,285 --> 01:35:05,255
[Ed] What happened
to your car?

1152
01:35:10,293 --> 01:35:11,926
Here we go.

1153
01:35:11,928 --> 01:35:13,698
We'll have
our own party, huh?

1154
01:35:20,402 --> 01:35:23,139
- What?
- Can you please take that off?

1155
01:35:30,914 --> 01:35:33,782
It won't always be like this,
I promise.

1156
01:35:33,784 --> 01:35:35,315
You know,
and sooner or later,

1157
01:35:35,317 --> 01:35:37,484
you'll find people
who understand.

1158
01:35:37,486 --> 01:35:39,887
And as for young Anthony,

1159
01:35:39,889 --> 01:35:41,859
he better hope I don't
run into him anytime soon.

1160
01:35:42,159 --> 01:35:43,925
Ed.

1161
01:35:43,927 --> 01:35:45,096
[doorbell ringing]

1162
01:35:57,072 --> 01:35:58,174
Happy birthday, Judy.

1163
01:35:59,375 --> 01:36:00,377
[Judy] Thank you.

1164
01:36:01,076 --> 01:36:02,112
Happy birthday.

1165
01:36:05,382 --> 01:36:08,852
I, uh, had a little talk
with my brother.

1166
01:36:09,151 --> 01:36:10,518
Thanks.

1167
01:36:10,520 --> 01:36:12,287
Come in.

1168
01:36:12,289 --> 01:36:14,792
[Mary Ellen] Is it okay
if my boyfriend joins?

1169
01:36:15,525 --> 01:36:16,460
Sure.

1170
01:36:18,328 --> 01:36:19,293
Um...

1171
01:36:19,295 --> 01:36:22,031
- Hi, uh, thanks for having us.
- [Ed] Hey.

1172
01:36:22,898 --> 01:36:24,232
Bob's-Got-Balls.

1173
01:36:24,234 --> 01:36:25,899
No kidding.

1174
01:36:25,901 --> 01:36:28,036
- [girl] Hi, Judy!
- Happy birthday, Judy!

1175
01:36:28,038 --> 01:36:29,604
- Happy birthday!
- Happy birthday!

1176
01:36:29,606 --> 01:36:32,340
- Hello, Judy, happy birthday.
- [Ed] Hey, guys, welcome.

1177
01:36:32,342 --> 01:36:34,141
- Keep comin'.
- [both chuckle]

1178
01:36:34,143 --> 01:36:35,609
[Anthony]
Happy birthday, Judy.

1179
01:36:35,611 --> 01:36:37,147
- Anthony?
- [Anthony] I'm really sorry.

1180
01:36:38,013 --> 01:36:39,984
Am I still invited?

1181
01:36:41,484 --> 01:36:42,520
Sure.

1182
01:36:48,290 --> 01:36:49,392
[Lorraine] Daniela?

1183
01:36:50,427 --> 01:36:52,226
I have something for you.

1184
01:36:52,228 --> 01:36:53,429
[Daniela] For me?

1185
01:36:56,132 --> 01:36:57,168
[sighs]

1186
01:37:05,241 --> 01:37:07,242
You found out the hard way

1187
01:37:07,244 --> 01:37:10,644
that there is a lot of evil
in this room.

1188
01:37:10,646 --> 01:37:13,049
But you know
what I actually like about it?

1189
01:37:15,317 --> 01:37:18,088
All the evil in here...

1190
01:37:19,356 --> 01:37:22,893
reminds me of all the good
that's out there.

1191
01:37:38,941 --> 01:37:40,543
[Lorraine whispers]
Darling Daniela.

1192
01:37:45,981 --> 01:37:47,649
Did Judy tell you that?

1193
01:37:47,651 --> 01:37:49,954
No. Your dad did.

1194
01:37:54,557 --> 01:37:57,928
He also tells me
that he misses you.

1195
01:38:00,195 --> 01:38:03,331
And to stop being
so hard on yourself,

1196
01:38:03,333 --> 01:38:05,565
'cause it was
not your fault.

1197
01:38:05,567 --> 01:38:07,070
[sobbing]

1198
01:38:08,170 --> 01:38:09,339
[sniffles]

1199
01:38:15,611 --> 01:38:17,280
Thank you.

1200
01:38:19,148 --> 01:38:20,614
Um... [sniffles]

1201
01:38:20,616 --> 01:38:21,683
I'm sorry.

1202
01:38:21,685 --> 01:38:23,051
Oh.

1203
01:38:23,053 --> 01:38:24,351
It's okay.

1204
01:38:24,353 --> 01:38:25,623
You're young.

1205
01:38:30,360 --> 01:38:32,527
You know,
when I was about your age,

1206
01:38:32,529 --> 01:38:35,697
I once ran off with
a boyfriend for three days

1207
01:38:35,699 --> 01:38:37,534
without telling my parents.

1208
01:38:38,535 --> 01:38:39,904
[chuckles]

1209
01:38:40,402 --> 01:38:42,403
I unleashed a demon.

1210
01:38:42,405 --> 01:38:44,008
So not the same thing.

1211
01:38:44,975 --> 01:38:46,977
Well, okay. True.

1212
01:38:47,744 --> 01:38:49,612
[both chuckle]

1213
01:38:53,182 --> 01:38:55,451
Does Mr. Warren know
about this boyfriend?

1214
01:38:56,386 --> 01:38:58,022
He was the boyfriend.

1215
01:39:02,525 --> 01:39:04,391
[Ed] Anybody wanna
hear a song? Whoa!

1216
01:39:04,393 --> 01:39:06,396
- [boy] Yeah!
- [all cheering]

1217
01:39:08,298 --> 01:39:10,200
[Ed] All right, okay.
