1
00:04:22,141 --> 00:04:23,061
Captain, I'd like to request that
it be me who's the attorney ...

2
00:04:23,061 --> 00:04:27,737
Captain, I'd like to request that
it be me who's the attorney ...

3
00:04:28,741 --> 00:04:34,452
That it be myself who's assigned ...
No, that it be I who am assigned ...

4
00:04:35,621 --> 00:04:40,297
That it be / who am assigned?
That's confidence inspiring!

5
00:04:41,101 --> 00:04:44,252
Good grammar, there!

6
00:04:50,701 --> 00:04:55,695
- Lieutenant Commander GaIloway.
- Captain West is expecting you.

7
00:04:59,621 --> 00:05:02,772
Jo, come on in.

8
00:05:02,941 --> 00:05:07,571
Lt. Commander GaIloway.
You know Commander Lawrence?

9
00:05:07,741 --> 00:05:13,259
- I appreciate you seeing me.
- WiII you sit down? Have a seat!

10
00:05:14,821 --> 00:05:19,497
- We've had some trouble in Cuba?
- Yes, sir. Last Friday.

11
00:05:19,661 --> 00:05:28,057
Corporal Dawson and Private Downey
assauIted Private WiIliam Santiago.

12
00:05:28,221 --> 00:05:31,531
Santiago died in hospital
an hour Iater.

13
00:05:31,701 --> 00:05:34,932
NavaI InteIligence Service says
the two men -

14
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:40,016
- wanted to stop Santiago naming
Dawson in a fenceline shooting.

15
00:05:40,181 --> 00:05:44,891
- The hearing's at 1600 hours.
- What's the probIem?

16
00:05:45,061 --> 00:05:49,976
They're both model marines.
Santiago was a screw-up.

17
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:54,771
- It sounds like a Code Red.
- Christ!

18
00:05:54,941 --> 00:05:58,411
I'd Iike to have them
assigned counsel.

19
00:05:58,581 --> 00:06:05,931
Someone who has both the legal skiII
and a famiIiarity with the military.

20
00:06:06,101 --> 00:06:10,458
I'd Iike to suggest that
l be the one who that ...

21
00:06:10,621 --> 00:06:15,741
... that it be me who is assigned
to represent them, myself.

22
00:06:17,341 --> 00:06:21,778
- Why don't you get a cup of coffee?
- I'm fine, sir.

23
00:06:21,941 --> 00:06:27,061
Leave the room, so we can
talk about you behind your back.

24
00:06:33,541 --> 00:06:39,252
- Do Code Reds stiII go on?
- Who knows what goes on there?

25
00:06:39,421 --> 00:06:45,690
We'd better find out soon.
What about this Commander Galloway?

26
00:06:45,861 --> 00:06:50,889
She's been working a desk at
Internal Affairs for a year.

27
00:06:51,061 --> 00:06:56,533
- She did three cases in two years.
- She's not very fast!

28
00:06:56,701 --> 00:07:03,573
- She's not a Iitigator.
- But she's a great investigator!

29
00:07:03,741 --> 00:07:09,179
I know: aII passion,
no street smarts. Bring her back in.

30
00:07:12,901 --> 00:07:15,859
Jo.

31
00:07:18,261 --> 00:07:24,052
We'lI have them moved here
and assigned counsel.

32
00:07:25,061 --> 00:07:27,700
But ... not me?

33
00:07:27,861 --> 00:07:31,092
You're too valuable to waste -

34
00:07:31,261 --> 00:07:35,573
- on a five-minute plea bargain
and a week's paperwork.

35
00:07:35,741 --> 00:07:41,976
- There might be more involved ...
- Division wiII find the right man.

36
00:07:42,141 --> 00:07:44,336
Let's go, Iet's get two!

37
00:07:45,821 --> 00:07:52,420
- Sorry.
- Look the baII into your gIove.

38
00:07:54,301 --> 00:07:58,817
Keep your eyes open!
Then you'II have a better chance.

39
00:07:58,981 --> 00:08:03,691
- Kaffee!
- You seem distraught.

40
00:08:03,861 --> 00:08:07,820
You're stalling
on the McDermott case.

41
00:08:07,981 --> 00:08:12,657
We do it now,
or I'll hang him from a yardarm!

42
00:08:12,821 --> 00:08:17,975
- Do we hang peopIe from yardarms?
- I don't think so.

43
00:08:18,141 --> 00:08:21,178
Sherby doesn't think
we do that any more.

44
00:08:21,341 --> 00:08:28,577
I'm charging him with possession.
Plead guilty and he'lI get 30 days.

45
00:08:28,741 --> 00:08:33,371
- it was oregano!
- He thought it was marijuana.

46
00:08:33,541 --> 00:08:36,135
He's a moron. That's not iIIegaI.

47
00:08:36,301 --> 00:08:43,218
- I'm gonna charge him!
- With possession of a condiment?

48
00:08:43,381 --> 00:08:48,660
- I'll file a motion to dismiss.
- You won't get it!

49
00:08:48,821 --> 00:08:55,818
I'll ask for an evidentiary ruIing,
then Iook for bail reIease ...

50
00:08:55,981 --> 00:09:01,772
You'II get three months' paperwork
because he smoked a bag of oregano.

51
00:09:05,261 --> 00:09:09,857
- 20 days in the brig!
- 15 days' restricted duty.

52
00:09:11,341 --> 00:09:15,459
- Why am I agreeing?
- You have wisdom beyond your years.

53
00:09:19,261 --> 00:09:23,937
Good morning ...
How's the baby, Sam?

54
00:09:24,101 --> 00:09:28,652
- She'II say her first word soon.
- How can you telI?

55
00:09:28,821 --> 00:09:33,019
She just Iooks like
she has something to say.

56
00:09:33,181 --> 00:09:38,938
- Sorry I'm Iate.
- l won't ask you for a bad excuse.

57
00:09:39,101 --> 00:09:43,060
- Thank you, sir.
- This first one's for you.

58
00:09:43,221 --> 00:09:48,011
You're moving up in the worId.
Division wants you.

59
00:09:48,181 --> 00:09:52,015
- To do what?
- Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

60
00:09:52,181 --> 00:09:58,814
A Marine Corporal named Dawson
fired over the fenceline into Cuba.

61
00:09:58,981 --> 00:10:01,211
What's a fenceline?

62
00:10:01,381 --> 00:10:06,216
- Between good guys and bad guys.
- Teacher's pet.

63
00:10:06,381 --> 00:10:11,250
Santiago threatens to rat on Dawson
to Naval Investigators.

64
00:10:11,421 --> 00:10:15,175
Dawson and Private Louden Downey -

65
00:10:15,341 --> 00:10:20,574
- tie Santiago up,
and stuff a rag down his throat.

66
00:10:20,741 --> 00:10:26,293
An hour Iater, he's dead.
There was a toxin on the rag.

67
00:10:26,461 --> 00:10:32,616
- They poisoned the rag?
- Not according to them.

68
00:10:32,781 --> 00:10:38,299
They get here tomorrow.
On Wednesday, 0600, you fly to Cuba.

69
00:10:38,461 --> 00:10:44,934
In the meantime, go and see
Lt. Commander JoAnne GalIoway.

70
00:10:45,101 --> 00:10:50,380
- Any questions?
- I fIy at 0600? ln the morning?

71
00:10:51,541 --> 00:10:56,092
We'lI go by the book,
so I'm assigning co-counseI.

72
00:10:56,261 --> 00:11:02,291
- Any voIunteers?
- No. l've a stack of papers to do.

73
00:11:02,461 --> 00:11:06,374
- Work with Kaffee.
- For just four days?

74
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:11,410
Doing various administrative ...
things.

75
00:11:11,581 --> 00:11:17,451
In other words, no responsibilities?
My kind of case!

76
00:11:18,661 --> 00:11:22,939
Right, but I need that report
by Wednesday.

77
00:11:29,141 --> 00:11:31,701
- Hi!
- Hold on ... Hi!

78
00:11:31,861 --> 00:11:35,820
DanieI Kaffee.
I was toId to meet ...

79
00:11:41,261 --> 00:11:45,334
...Lieutenant Commander GaIloway.

80
00:11:46,181 --> 00:11:51,892
- About a briefing.
- l'II calI you back.

81
00:11:52,061 --> 00:11:56,498
- You're the attorney?
- Yes, and this is Sam Weinberg.

82
00:11:56,661 --> 00:12:00,734
- l have no responsibiIities.
- Have a seat.

83
00:12:10,861 --> 00:12:16,254
- Have you been in the Navy long?
- Nine months now.

84
00:12:16,421 --> 00:12:21,370
- And when did you graduate?
- A year ago.

85
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:25,136
- I see.
- Have I done something wrong?

86
00:12:25,301 --> 00:12:30,329
When I asked for counsel,
I hoped to be taken seriously.

87
00:12:30,501 --> 00:12:33,095
No offence taken.

88
00:12:33,261 --> 00:12:40,292
He's our best Iitigator. He obtained
44 plea bargains in nine months.

89
00:12:40,461 --> 00:12:44,249
- AImost got my steak knives.
- Have you ever been in court?

90
00:12:44,421 --> 00:12:50,735
I had my licence suspended ...
They need a priest, not a Iawyer.

91
00:12:50,901 --> 00:12:54,177
No, they'II need a Iawyer.

92
00:12:54,341 --> 00:12:59,654
Dawson's famiIy has been contacted.
Downey just has his aunt.

93
00:12:59,821 --> 00:13:04,019
- ShaIl I contact her?
- Sure, if you feeI Iike it.

94
00:13:05,741 --> 00:13:11,691
You'Il be seeing CoIoneI Jessep.
You've heard of him?

95
00:13:11,861 --> 00:13:14,216
Who hasn't?

96
00:13:14,381 --> 00:13:20,172
The papers say he's tipped for
the NationaI Security CounciI.

97
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:25,699
- Santiago sent these from GlTMO.
- That's Guantanamo Bay.

98
00:13:25,861 --> 00:13:30,332
He wrote to aII the senior officers,
even his senator.

99
00:13:30,501 --> 00:13:35,575
He wanted a transfer.
No one Iistened. Are you with me?

100
00:13:36,781 --> 00:13:44,210
Then he offered to trade information
about the shooting for a transfer.

101
00:13:44,381 --> 00:13:46,849
Right. Is that aII?

102
00:13:47,021 --> 00:13:51,219
It seems your cIient had
a motive to kiII Santiago.

103
00:13:51,381 --> 00:13:55,977
- Got you! And Santiago is ... who?
- The victim.

104
00:13:56,141 --> 00:14:01,374
These Ietters are not fIattering
about Marine Corps life?

105
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:06,661
And an investigation might
embarrass the Security Council guy?

106
00:14:06,821 --> 00:14:10,530
- CoIoneI Jessep ...
- 12 years.

107
00:14:10,701 --> 00:14:15,092
If they drop ''conspiracy'' and
''conduct unbecoming''.

108
00:14:15,261 --> 00:14:20,051
- You haven't done anything yet!
- Impressive, huh?

109
00:14:20,221 --> 00:14:24,499
- You'll have to go deeper.
-Do you have jurisdiction here?

110
00:14:24,661 --> 00:14:29,291
My job is to make sure
you do your job.

111
00:14:29,461 --> 00:14:32,533
So my jurisdiction's in your face.

112
00:14:34,581 --> 00:14:38,938
Read the Ietters.
Report when you return from Cuba.

113
00:14:39,101 --> 00:14:44,573
- Dismissed!
- I aIways forget that part.

114
00:14:46,341 --> 00:14:51,654
He's preoccupied.
He has a basebaII game next week.

115
00:14:51,821 --> 00:14:56,258
TeIl him not to get cute.
Guantamo marines are fanaticaI.

116
00:14:56,421 --> 00:14:59,970
- About what?
- About being marines.

117
00:15:00,141 --> 00:15:03,531
"My name is PFC Wi//iam Santiago -

118
00:15:03,701 --> 00:15:09,173
- of Rifle Security Company
Windward, 2nd Platoon Bravo.

119
00:15:09,341 --> 00:15:14,415
I am writing to inform you ofmy
problems here in Cuba.

120
00:15:14,581 --> 00:15:19,655
I've faIIen out of runs before,
because of dizziness or nausea.

121
00:15:19,821 --> 00:15:25,817
On May 18th, I'd fa//en back about
20 yards going down a rocky hilI.

122
00:15:25,981 --> 00:15:32,500
My sergeant pushed me down the hiI/,
then I saw a/I bIack and feII down.

123
00:15:32,661 --> 00:15:35,812
The hospitaI said
it was heat exhaustion.

124
00:15:35,981 --> 00:15:40,816
I ask your help.
I need a transfer out of RSC.

125
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:45,179
SincereIy, PFC Wi//iam T. Santiago,
US Marines. "

126
00:15:45,341 --> 00:15:49,175
"PS: In exchange for my transfer, -

127
00:15:49,341 --> 00:15:54,210
- I have information about
the shooting on August 2nd. "

128
00:15:55,181 --> 00:15:59,299
Who the fuck is
PFC WiIIiam T. Santiago?

129
00:15:59,461 --> 00:16:02,339
He's in 2nd PIatoon Bravo, sir.

130
00:16:02,501 --> 00:16:06,540
ApparentIy he's not happy here
at Shangri-la.

131
00:16:06,701 --> 00:16:11,297
He's asked everyone but
Santa Claus for a transfer.

132
00:16:11,461 --> 00:16:16,774
Now he's telling taIes about a
fenceIine shooting. Matthew?

133
00:16:16,941 --> 00:16:22,413
- I'm appalIed, sir.
- You're appalIed.

134
00:16:23,421 --> 00:16:28,495
This kid ratted on a member of his
unit, to say nothing of the fact -

135
00:16:28,661 --> 00:16:35,009
- that he's a US marine
who can't run without colIapsing.

136
00:16:35,181 --> 00:16:41,177
- What is going on in Bravo company?
- Can we discuss it in private?

137
00:16:41,341 --> 00:16:45,220
l can handIe this situation, sir.

138
00:16:45,381 --> 00:16:50,375
Like you handIed Curtis BeII?
Don't interrupt, I'm your superior!

139
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:57,333
And I'm yours, Matthew.
What are we going to do about this?

140
00:16:57,501 --> 00:17:01,858
- He should be transferred at once.
- He's that bad?

141
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:07,414
If word of this Ietter gets out,
he'Il get his ass whipped.

142
00:17:07,581 --> 00:17:15,693
Transfer Santiago? You're right.
Yes, that's the thing to do.

143
00:17:17,381 --> 00:17:21,260
Wait! I've got a better idea.

144
00:17:21,421 --> 00:17:25,016
Let's transfer the whoIe squad.

145
00:17:25,181 --> 00:17:31,256
No, Iet's transfer
the whole division off the base.

146
00:17:31,421 --> 00:17:36,541
Jon, go and teII the boys
to pack their bags.

147
00:17:36,701 --> 00:17:39,090
Tom!

148
00:17:39,261 --> 00:17:44,494
Get me the President. We're
surrendering our position in Cuba.

149
00:17:44,661 --> 00:17:51,817
Wait a minute, Tom. Maybe we
shouId consider this for a second.

150
00:17:51,981 --> 00:17:55,018
Dismissed, Tom.

151
00:17:55,181 --> 00:17:58,651
I'm just spit-baIIing here, -

152
00:17:58,821 --> 00:18:03,531
- but maybe it's our responsibiIity
to train Santiago?

153
00:18:03,701 --> 00:18:08,092
Maybe we have a responsibility
to this country to see -

154
00:18:08,261 --> 00:18:13,096
- that those protecting it
are trained professionals.

155
00:18:13,261 --> 00:18:16,776
I think I read that somewhere once.

156
00:18:16,941 --> 00:18:23,494
And I'm thinking, CoIoneI, that your
idea of transferring Santiago, -

157
00:18:23,661 --> 00:18:26,733
- whiIe expeditious and painIess, -

158
00:18:26,901 --> 00:18:32,021
- might not be quite
the American Way?

159
00:18:32,181 --> 00:18:36,299
Santiago stays where he is.

160
00:18:36,461 --> 00:18:41,455
We're going to train the lad.
Jon, you're in charge.

161
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:48,094
If Santiago doesn't get 4.6, 4.6
in his next proficiency report, -

162
00:18:48,261 --> 00:18:53,096
- I'm going to bIame you.
And then I'll kiII you.

163
00:18:53,261 --> 00:18:56,890
I think that's a mistake, CoIoneI.

164
00:18:57,061 --> 00:19:01,100
Matthew, I think
I'II have that word in private now.

165
00:19:01,261 --> 00:19:07,530
That's alI. Meet me at the ''O"' cIub.
We'lI talk about WiIIiam's training.

166
00:19:07,701 --> 00:19:12,058
- I'lI weIcome your suggestions.
- Dismissed.

167
00:19:15,741 --> 00:19:18,733
Matthew, sit down. PIease.

168
00:19:23,941 --> 00:19:28,014
- What do you think of Kendrick?
- I don't think my opinion ...

169
00:19:28,181 --> 00:19:31,173
I think he's a bit of a weaseI.

170
00:19:31,341 --> 00:19:37,416
But he's a very good officer, and
we agree on how to do our job.

171
00:19:37,581 --> 00:19:44,419
Our business is saving Iives.
We have to take that seriously.

172
00:19:44,581 --> 00:19:51,054
I believe that if we transfer a
marine who is not up to the job, -

173
00:19:51,221 --> 00:19:57,330
- we put lives in danger.
Sit down, Matthew.

174
00:20:05,061 --> 00:20:13,014
We went to the Aoademy together,
served in Vietnam together.

175
00:20:13,181 --> 00:20:18,813
But I've been promoted with
more speed and success than you.

176
00:20:18,981 --> 00:20:24,692
If that causes you tension or
embarrassment, I don't give a shit.

177
00:20:24,861 --> 00:20:29,935
Our business is saving Iives,
Lieutenant CoIonel Markinson.

178
00:20:30,101 --> 00:20:35,653
Don't ever question my orders
in front of another officer.

179
00:20:52,981 --> 00:20:58,055
AII the paperwork's in order.
Step over there.

180
00:21:01,781 --> 00:21:07,014
- HaI, is this Washington D.C.?
- AlI right, Iet's move.

181
00:21:16,181 --> 00:21:20,459
I wanted to taIk to you
about Dawson and Downey.

182
00:21:20,621 --> 00:21:24,170
- Say again?
- Dawson and Downey.

183
00:21:24,341 --> 00:21:28,971
- The names seem famiIiar, but ...
- Your cIients?

184
00:21:29,141 --> 00:21:32,213
The Cuba thing! Oh yeah, right.

185
00:21:34,541 --> 00:21:37,135
I've done something wrong again.

186
00:21:37,301 --> 00:21:41,897
Why are they sitting in jaiI
whiIe you're hitting a baII?

187
00:21:43,941 --> 00:21:49,095
- We need to practice.
- That wasn't funny.

188
00:21:49,261 --> 00:21:54,255
WouId you be insulted
if I recommended another counseI?

189
00:21:54,421 --> 00:21:57,572
- Why?
- I don't think you're up to it.

190
00:21:58,141 --> 00:22:04,057
You don't even know me! It usuaIIy
takes people hours to find that out.

191
00:22:05,941 --> 00:22:08,739
That was funny!

192
00:22:11,581 --> 00:22:15,699
You're wrong. l do know you.

193
00:22:15,861 --> 00:22:21,174
DanieI AIistair Kaffee,
born June 8th, 1964, in Boston.

194
00:22:21,341 --> 00:22:27,689
Son of LioneI Kaffee, former
Attorney-GeneraI, died 1985.

195
00:22:27,861 --> 00:22:33,060
You went to Harvard, then joined the
Navy, because your father wanted it.

196
00:22:33,221 --> 00:22:39,774
You're just treading water here
until you get a reaI job.

197
00:22:39,941 --> 00:22:43,172
But that's fine, l won't telI.

198
00:22:43,341 --> 00:22:48,176
But if you handIe this case in your
usuaI sIick manner, -

199
00:22:48,341 --> 00:22:51,856
- then something's gonna get missed.

200
00:22:52,021 --> 00:22:56,970
I can't Iet Dawson and Downey
sit in jaiI -

201
00:22:57,141 --> 00:23:01,419
- because you chose
the path of Ieast resistance.

202
00:23:02,821 --> 00:23:07,611
Wow!
l"m sexuaIIy aroused, Commander!

203
00:23:07,781 --> 00:23:13,731
I don't think it was murder.
There was no intent.

204
00:23:13,901 --> 00:23:18,292
Santiago asphyxiated
from acute lactic acidosis.

205
00:23:18,461 --> 00:23:24,980
It was suggestive of poison.
Whatever that means, it sounds bad.

206
00:23:25,181 --> 00:23:29,333
When he died, the doctor
didn't know the reason.

207
00:23:29,501 --> 00:23:37,419
- Two hours Iater, he said poison.
- Was it Prof. PIumb in the Iibrary?

208
00:23:37,581 --> 00:23:39,936
I'Il see your supervisor.

209
00:23:40,101 --> 00:23:45,539
He's in the big white house
with the piIlars.

210
00:23:45,701 --> 00:23:52,140
I don't think you'II have much Iuok.
Division must think I'm good.

211
00:23:52,301 --> 00:23:57,898
l appreciate your interest and
enthusiasm, but I can handle things.

212
00:23:58,061 --> 00:24:01,895
Do you know what a Code Red is?

213
00:24:03,981 --> 00:24:07,371
What a pity.

214
00:24:18,701 --> 00:24:20,817
Officer on deck, ten-hut!

215
00:24:20,981 --> 00:24:25,418
CorporaI Dawson, sir!
RSC Company Windward!

216
00:24:25,581 --> 00:24:30,177
You haven't been ''working
weII with others'', HaroId!

217
00:24:31,581 --> 00:24:35,051
PFC Louden Downey, sir!

218
00:24:35,221 --> 00:24:39,897
I'm DanieI Kaffee,
this is Sam Weinberg. Sit down.

219
00:24:45,941 --> 00:24:50,332
This your signature? Don't say sir.
Is this yours ?

220
00:24:50,501 --> 00:24:54,540
- Sir,yes, sir!
- At least don't say it twice.

221
00:24:54,701 --> 00:24:59,331
- What's a Code Red?
- It's a discipIinary action.

222
00:24:59,501 --> 00:25:03,210
If a marine faIIs out of Iine,
the others get him on track.

223
00:25:03,381 --> 00:25:06,578
- What's the garden variety?
- Sir?

224
00:25:06,741 --> 00:25:12,771
You say ''sir"' and l look for
my father. Danny, DanieI Kaffee.

225
00:25:12,941 --> 00:25:15,933
What's a typicaI Code Red?

226
00:25:16,101 --> 00:25:21,050
If a marine won't bathe,
the men give him a GI shower.

227
00:25:21,221 --> 00:25:26,215
- And what's that?
- Scrub brushes, steeI wooI.

228
00:25:26,381 --> 00:25:30,533
Was the attack on Santiago
a Code Red?

229
00:25:35,541 --> 00:25:38,419
Does he ever taIk?

230
00:25:38,581 --> 00:25:43,371
He wiII answer any direct question.

231
00:25:45,021 --> 00:25:49,412
- Was there poison on the rag?
- No, sir.

232
00:25:49,581 --> 00:25:54,132
- Turpentine, anti-freeze?
- We were going to shave his head.

233
00:25:54,301 --> 00:26:00,058
- When suddenly ...
- BIood was dripping down his mouth.

234
00:26:00,221 --> 00:26:06,569
There was blood alI over his face,
so Dawson caIIed the ambuIance.

235
00:26:06,741 --> 00:26:11,337
- Did anyone see you caII it?
- No, sir.

236
00:26:13,861 --> 00:26:17,854
- Were you there when it arrived?
- Yes, and we were arrested.

237
00:26:18,021 --> 00:26:24,369
Did you on Aug. 2nd fire a shot
across the fenceIine into Cuba?

238
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:28,420
Yes, sir. My mirror engaged, sir.

239
00:26:28,581 --> 00:26:35,453
Every American sentry has
a Cuban counterpart. His '"mirror''.

240
00:26:35,621 --> 00:26:40,536
Santiago's Ietter says
you fired iIIegalIy.

241
00:26:40,701 --> 00:26:45,855
He says the ''mirror''
never made a move.

242
00:26:49,501 --> 00:26:54,495
HaroId ...?
You see what I'm getting at?

243
00:26:54,661 --> 00:26:58,017
Why eIse wouId you
give him a Code Red?

244
00:26:58,181 --> 00:27:03,255
He broke the chain of command.
He went outside his unit.

245
00:27:03,421 --> 00:27:07,892
He shouId have spoken to me first,
then his sergeant ...

246
00:27:08,061 --> 00:27:11,292
AII right.
Did you intend to kiIl Santiago?

247
00:27:11,461 --> 00:27:15,739
- No sir, to train him!
- Train him to do what?

248
00:27:15,901 --> 00:27:20,099
To think of his unit before himself.
To respect the code.

249
00:27:20,261 --> 00:27:23,970
- What's the code?
- Unit, Corps, God, Country!

250
00:27:24,141 --> 00:27:29,659
- Pardon?
- Unit, Corps, God, Country ... sir.

251
00:27:45,181 --> 00:27:51,017
The government
wants to charge you with murder.

252
00:27:51,181 --> 00:27:56,380
You want me to telI the prosecutor
'Unit, Corps, God, Country' ?

253
00:27:56,541 --> 00:28:00,534
That's our code, sir.

254
00:28:02,221 --> 00:28:06,578
That's your code.
We'II be back.

255
00:28:06,741 --> 00:28:12,532
- You need anything? Books, papers?
- No thank you, sir!

256
00:28:12,701 --> 00:28:16,489
There's a concept
you'd better get used to.

257
00:28:16,661 --> 00:28:20,256
- Sir?
- I'm the onIy friend you've got.

258
00:28:33,141 --> 00:28:38,010
- WeIcome to the big time!
- You think so?

259
00:28:38,181 --> 00:28:41,810
I hope you're better at Iaw
than at softbaII.

260
00:28:41,981 --> 00:28:47,931
UnfortunateIy l pIay softbaII best.
I'm off to Cuba, JaneIIe!

261
00:28:48,101 --> 00:28:51,377
Say hi to Castro for me.

262
00:28:51,541 --> 00:28:56,137
If they pIead guiIty
they get 20 years and serve haIf.

263
00:28:56,301 --> 00:29:02,012
- 12. They caIIed the ambuIance.
- They kilIed a marine.

264
00:29:02,181 --> 00:29:06,140
The Iab says maybe
the rag was poisoned.

265
00:29:06,301 --> 00:29:10,579
The Chief of lnternaI Medicine
says he's sure.

266
00:29:10,741 --> 00:29:15,531
- What do you know about Code Reds?
- Oh, man ...

267
00:29:16,301 --> 00:29:19,976
Are we off the record?

268
00:29:20,141 --> 00:29:24,771
You'II get the 12 years.
But you shouId know -

269
00:29:24,941 --> 00:29:32,700
- Lieutenant Kendrick specificaIIy
told the men not to touch Santiago.

270
00:29:34,781 --> 00:29:38,376
- We playing hoops tomorrow?
- Do we have a deaI?

271
00:29:38,541 --> 00:29:41,772
I'lI talk to you when I get back.

272
00:29:44,941 --> 00:29:49,856
- Any Iuck getting me repIaced?
- Everyone's your friend.

273
00:29:50,021 --> 00:29:55,254
Listen, l came to make peace.
What do you say, friends?

274
00:29:55,421 --> 00:29:58,618
I took Downey
the comic books he wanted.

275
00:29:58,781 --> 00:30:02,535
He hardIy knows
why he's been arrested.

276
00:30:02,701 --> 00:30:06,979
- Look, Commander ...
- CaII me JoAnne. Or Jo.

277
00:30:07,141 --> 00:30:12,579
You contact them again,
I'Il have you disbarred. Friends?

278
00:30:12,741 --> 00:30:19,931
I had authorization
from Ginny MiIIer, his aunt.

279
00:30:20,821 --> 00:30:25,292
- Aunt Ginny authorized you?
- I caIled her.

280
00:30:25,461 --> 00:30:30,057
- We spoke for an hour.
- You were authorized by Aunt Ginny.

281
00:30:30,221 --> 00:30:35,011
- it's within my province.
- We can hoId the triaI in her barn.

282
00:30:35,181 --> 00:30:39,413
I'Ii sew the costumes,
UncIe Goober can be judge.

283
00:30:41,461 --> 00:30:45,773
I'm going to Cuba with you tomorrow.

284
00:30:45,941 --> 00:30:50,776
''And the hits just keep on coming.''

285
00:31:10,741 --> 00:31:14,336
- How's it going, Luther?
- Another day, another doIIar.

286
00:31:14,501 --> 00:31:18,972
- PIay as they lay.
- What goes around comes around.

287
00:31:19,141 --> 00:31:24,056
- I got my heaIth.
- You got everything. See you!

288
00:31:24,221 --> 00:31:26,974
Not if I see you first.

289
00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:32,413
You're my witness: the baby spoke.
She said a word.

290
00:31:32,581 --> 00:31:39,214
- She made a sound.
- Come on! It was definiteIy a word.

291
00:31:39,381 --> 00:31:44,250
You heard her.
She pointed and said ''Pa''.

292
00:31:44,421 --> 00:31:50,735
- She was pointing at a mailbox.
- Yes. ''Pa! Look, a maiIbox.''

293
00:31:57,421 --> 00:32:04,099
- Jack Ross offered me the 12 years.
- That's what you wanted, right?

294
00:32:04,261 --> 00:32:10,939
- I mean ... l guess I'II take it.
- So ..?

295
00:32:11,101 --> 00:32:17,859
- It took about 45 seconds.
- Take the 12 years, it's a gift.

296
00:32:18,021 --> 00:32:22,014
You don't beIieve them.
You think they shouId get life.

297
00:32:22,181 --> 00:32:27,858
I beIieve every word of their story,
and I think they shouId get Iife.

298
00:32:32,101 --> 00:32:34,217
See you tomorrow.

299
00:32:34,381 --> 00:32:38,454
- Don't forget to wear the whites!
- I don't Iike them.

300
00:32:38,621 --> 00:32:41,931
We're going to Cuba.
You got Dramamine?

301
00:32:42,101 --> 00:32:46,936
- That keeps you cooI?
- No, but you get airsick.

302
00:32:47,101 --> 00:32:51,777
It's because l'm afraid of crashing.
Dramamine won't help.

303
00:32:52,701 --> 00:32:56,819
I got some oregano,
l hear that works.

304
00:32:58,421 --> 00:33:02,414
Ross said a strange thing,
just before I Ieft.

305
00:33:02,581 --> 00:33:08,497
He said Lt. Kendrick had toId
the men not to touch Santiago.

306
00:33:08,661 --> 00:33:15,009
- So?
- I don't even know who Kendrick is.

307
00:33:17,021 --> 00:33:20,730
What the heII. See you tomorrow.

308
00:33:55,181 --> 00:34:01,620
I'm Corporal Barnes, l'II escort you
to the Windward side of the base.

309
00:34:01,781 --> 00:34:06,491
l have camoufIage jackets,
I suggest you wear them.

310
00:34:06,661 --> 00:34:09,733
We're going cIose to the fenceIine.

311
00:34:09,901 --> 00:34:15,612
lf the Cubans see an officer in
white they might take a shot.

312
00:34:15,781 --> 00:34:18,295
Good caII, Sam.

313
00:34:22,781 --> 00:34:25,249
We'II just take the ferry.

314
00:34:25,421 --> 00:34:29,334
- We're taking a boat?
- Across the bay.

315
00:34:29,501 --> 00:34:36,100
No one mentioned a boat.
l'm just not crazy about them.

316
00:34:36,261 --> 00:34:43,372
- Jesus Christ, you're in the Navy!
- Nobody likes her very much.

317
00:34:56,301 --> 00:34:59,896
Nathan Jessep. Come on in.

318
00:35:00,061 --> 00:35:02,939
DanieI Kaffee, attorney.

319
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:06,377
Lt. Commander
JoAnne GaIIoway.

320
00:35:06,541 --> 00:35:10,739
Observing and evaluating.
Lt. Weinberg, my assistant.

321
00:35:10,901 --> 00:35:17,249
This is CoIoneI Markinson,
and PIatoon Leader Lt. Kendrick.

322
00:35:17,421 --> 00:35:19,696
Lieutenant Kaffee.

323
00:35:19,861 --> 00:35:24,093
I met your father once.
He spoke at my high schooI.

324
00:35:24,261 --> 00:35:28,937
- LioneI Kaffee?
- Yes, sir.

325
00:35:29,101 --> 00:35:33,379
Jon, this man's dad
once made a lot of enemies.

326
00:35:33,541 --> 00:35:37,011
Jefferson versus
Madison County SchooI District.

327
00:35:37,181 --> 00:35:41,379
They didn"t want a bIack girI
in a white school.

328
00:35:41,541 --> 00:35:45,136
Lionel Kaffee said,
''We'll see about that.''

329
00:35:45,301 --> 00:35:51,740
- How the heII is your dad, Danny?
- He passed away seven years ago.

330
00:35:51,901 --> 00:35:57,055
- Don't l feel Iike an asshoIe!
- Not at aII, sir.

331
00:35:57,221 --> 00:36:02,295
- What can we do for you, Danny?
- Not much, sir.

332
00:36:02,461 --> 00:36:06,852
This is reaIIy just a formaIity.

333
00:36:07,021 --> 00:36:12,857
- They insist we interview everyone.
- JAG Corps can be demanding.

334
00:36:13,021 --> 00:36:20,814
Jon'II show you what you want to
see, then we can meet for lunch.

335
00:36:29,341 --> 00:36:34,051
You met with the men that afternoon.
What did you say?

336
00:36:34,221 --> 00:36:37,577
I toId them we had an informer, -

337
00:36:37,741 --> 00:36:42,690
- but that Private Santiago
was not to be harmed.

338
00:36:42,861 --> 00:36:46,297
- What time was that?
- 1600.

339
00:36:46,461 --> 00:36:49,498
That's four o'cIock.

340
00:37:38,061 --> 00:37:43,419
We shouId make sure somebody
gets this to his parents.

341
00:37:44,781 --> 00:37:48,899
- Lt. Kendrick, may I caIl you Jon?
- No.

342
00:37:49,061 --> 00:37:53,134
- Have l offended you?
- No, I Iike aII you Navy boys.

343
00:37:53,301 --> 00:37:58,455
When we have to fight,
you feIIas aIways give us a ride.

344
00:37:58,621 --> 00:38:01,533
Do you think he was murdered?

345
00:38:01,701 --> 00:38:06,491
I beIieve in God and Jesus Christ,
so I'lI say this:

346
00:38:06,661 --> 00:38:10,051
Santiago's death is a tragedy.

347
00:38:10,221 --> 00:38:16,456
But he died because he had no code,
and no honour. And God was watching.

348
00:38:18,941 --> 00:38:22,650
- How do you feeI about that theory?
- Sounds good.

349
00:38:22,821 --> 00:38:28,179
Are you going to investigate,
or just take the guided tour?

350
00:38:28,341 --> 00:38:30,941
I'm pacing myseIf.

351
00:38:31,101 --> 00:38:36,255
They ran around
looking for something white to wave.

352
00:38:36,421 --> 00:38:40,573
Some of them surrendered
to a crew from CNN.

353
00:38:40,741 --> 00:38:47,055
WaIk softly and carry an armoured
tank division, I aIways say.

354
00:38:47,221 --> 00:38:50,099
That was delicious.

355
00:38:50,261 --> 00:38:56,370
- l do have to ask some questions.
- Shoot!

356
00:38:56,541 --> 00:39:02,935
An NIS agent told you that Santiago
knew about a fenceIine shooting.

357
00:39:03,101 --> 00:39:09,131
Santiago was going to say who did it
in exchange for a transfer.

358
00:39:10,301 --> 00:39:16,012
If you feel there are any detaiIs
I'm missing, teIl me.

359
00:39:18,501 --> 00:39:21,732
Thank you.

360
00:39:23,461 --> 00:39:31,141
You calIed CoIoneI Markinson and
Lt. Kendrick into your office. And?

361
00:39:31,301 --> 00:39:36,773
We agreed that for his own safety
he should be transferred.

362
00:39:36,941 --> 00:39:40,695
Santiago was set to be transferred?

363
00:39:40,861 --> 00:39:45,491
On the first flight to the States.
0600 next morning.

364
00:39:45,661 --> 00:39:49,449
Five hours too late, it turned out.

365
00:39:50,621 --> 00:39:55,820
AlI right, that's aIl.
Thanks very much for your time.

366
00:39:55,981 --> 00:39:59,769
The corporal wiIl drive you back.

367
00:39:59,941 --> 00:40:04,014
- Wait, I've got some questions.
- No, you don't. No!

368
00:40:04,221 --> 00:40:09,136
On the morning of the death,
did you meet Dr. Stone?

369
00:40:09,301 --> 00:40:15,649
- Of course. One of my men was dead.
- You see? He was dead. Let's go.

370
00:40:15,821 --> 00:40:22,056
- Have you ever heard of Code Red?
- I've heard the term, yes.

371
00:40:22,221 --> 00:40:27,693
In February, you received a memo
from the FIeet Commander -

372
00:40:27,861 --> 00:40:32,332
- warning against enIisted men
discipIining their own?

373
00:40:32,501 --> 00:40:40,738
Whoever wrote that memo has never
Iooked down a Cuban AK-47 rifIe.

374
00:40:40,901 --> 00:40:47,659
However, l gave it due attention.
What is your point, Jo?

375
00:40:47,821 --> 00:40:52,212
She has no point,
it's part of her charm. Goodbye!

376
00:40:52,381 --> 00:40:57,694
My point is that I think
Code Reds stiIl go on. Do they?

377
00:40:57,861 --> 00:41:05,336
- He doesn't need to answer that.
- Yes, he does.

378
00:41:05,501 --> 00:41:08,220
CoIoneI?

379
00:41:08,381 --> 00:41:14,900
You know, it just hit me.
She outranks you, Danny!

380
00:41:15,061 --> 00:41:18,337
I want to teIl you something.
Listen welI.

381
00:41:18,501 --> 00:41:21,220
You're a very Iucky man.

382
00:41:21,381 --> 00:41:28,219
There is nothing sexier then a woman
you have to saIute in the morning.

383
00:41:28,781 --> 00:41:31,978
Promote 'em aII, I say!

384
00:41:32,141 --> 00:41:36,373
If you've never had a blowjob
from a superior officer, -

385
00:41:36,541 --> 00:41:44,016
- you've missed the best in Iife.
- Code Reds are stiII condoned here?

386
00:41:44,181 --> 00:41:49,938
But I'Il just take coId showers
tiII they eIect some gaI president.

387
00:41:50,581 --> 00:41:55,780
- I need an answer to my question.
- Watch your tone, Commander.

388
00:41:55,941 --> 00:42:01,811
I'm a fair guy, but this
fucking heat makes me crazy.

389
00:42:02,701 --> 00:42:09,174
You asked me about Code Reds.
On the record, I discourage it.

390
00:42:09,341 --> 00:42:14,096
Off the record,
it's an invaluable part of training.

391
00:42:14,261 --> 00:42:20,814
If it goes on without my knowIedge,
so be it. That's how I run my unit.

392
00:42:20,981 --> 00:42:25,259
If you want to investigate me,
take your chances.

393
00:42:25,421 --> 00:42:29,778
I eat breakfast 300 yards from
4,000 Cubans trained to kiIl me.

394
00:42:29,941 --> 00:42:37,291
So don't think you can come
down here and make me nervous.

395
00:42:41,381 --> 00:42:44,532
Let's go.

396
00:42:45,421 --> 00:42:50,370
CoIoneI, I just need a copy
of the transfer order.

397
00:42:50,541 --> 00:42:55,251
Santiago's transfer order.
For the fiIe.

398
00:42:55,421 --> 00:43:00,051
- For the fiIe?
- Yeah.

399
00:43:00,221 --> 00:43:07,696
Of course you can have a copy.
I'm here to help any way l can.

400
00:43:07,861 --> 00:43:13,857
You beIieve that, don't you, Danny?
That l'II heIp any way I can?

401
00:43:14,021 --> 00:43:22,019
The corporaI wiIl take you by
PersonneI and get it for you.

402
00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:28,094
But you have to ask me nicely.

403
00:43:28,261 --> 00:43:32,891
- I beg your pardon?
- You have to ask me niceIy.

404
00:43:33,061 --> 00:43:38,977
I can take buIIets, bombs and bIood.
I don't want money or medaIs.

405
00:43:39,141 --> 00:43:45,489
What I do want is for you, with your
faggoty uniform and Harvard mouth, -

406
00:43:45,661 --> 00:43:49,973
- to extend me
some fucking courtesy.

407
00:43:50,661 --> 00:43:54,973
You got to ask me nicely.

408
00:43:56,501 --> 00:44:02,656
ColoneI Jessep, I'd Iike
a copy of the transfer order. Sir.

409
00:44:05,661 --> 00:44:08,334
No probIem.

410
00:44:48,381 --> 00:44:51,737
- Who is it?
- It's me.

411
00:44:51,901 --> 00:44:56,895
I've realIy missed you.
It's been three hours ...

412
00:44:57,061 --> 00:45:02,613
Markinson's disappeared.
He's gone U.A. Unauthorized Absence.

413
00:45:02,781 --> 00:45:06,979
- When?
- This afternoon, after we Ieft.

414
00:45:07,141 --> 00:45:11,373
- I'Il find him in the morning.
- l've aIready tried.

415
00:45:12,621 --> 00:45:17,820
You're cIose to '"interfering
with a government investigation.''

416
00:45:17,981 --> 00:45:24,056
I'm Louden Downey's attorney now.
Aunt Ginny feels Iike she knows me.

417
00:45:24,221 --> 00:45:28,533
So I suggested that I get more
directIy invoIved with the case.

418
00:45:28,701 --> 00:45:31,898
She had Louden sign the papers
an hour ago.

419
00:45:32,061 --> 00:45:36,100
You're not making this up
just to bother me?

420
00:45:36,261 --> 00:45:41,096
- You're stiII Iead counseI.
- SpIendid.

421
00:45:41,261 --> 00:45:47,496
I think Kendrick ordered the
Code Red, and so do you.

422
00:45:51,141 --> 00:45:53,132
Ten-hut!

423
00:45:53,301 --> 00:45:58,455
Did Kendrick order the Code Red?
Not: ''Did you cIean the latrine?''

424
00:45:58,621 --> 00:46:03,900
Did Lt. Kendrick order you
to give Santiago a Code Red?

425
00:46:04,061 --> 00:46:06,336
Yes, sir.

426
00:46:06,501 --> 00:46:10,176
- Did he?
- Yes, sir.

427
00:46:13,421 --> 00:46:17,858
- Why didn't you say so before?
- You didn't ask us, sir.

428
00:46:18,021 --> 00:46:22,572
I get paid, no matter how Iong
you spend in jaiI.

429
00:46:22,741 --> 00:46:26,814
- I know you do, sir.
- Fuck you, HaroId!

430
00:46:26,981 --> 00:46:32,135
At ease. Let's sort this thing out.

431
00:46:32,301 --> 00:46:35,418
There was a pIatoon meeting
on September 6th.

432
00:46:35,581 --> 00:46:40,177
Lt. Kendrick says he toId you
nothing was to happen to Santiago.

433
00:46:40,341 --> 00:46:45,369
ls this true?
I want you to speak freely.

434
00:46:48,181 --> 00:46:52,299
That's correct.
But then he dismissed the platoon.

435
00:46:52,461 --> 00:46:57,330
- What happened then?
- Lt. Kendrick came to our room.

436
00:46:58,821 --> 00:47:02,894
About five minutes after the
meeting broke. About 16.20.

437
00:47:03,061 --> 00:47:05,336
And then?

438
00:47:05,501 --> 00:47:09,619
Lt. Kendrick ordered us
to give Santiago a Code Red.

439
00:47:11,141 --> 00:47:15,373
Jack!
They were given an order.

440
00:47:18,501 --> 00:47:23,495
- Jack ...
- I'II be right back.

441
00:47:23,661 --> 00:47:30,419
- Did you know about the order?
- Jo GaIIoway: Downey's Iawyer.

442
00:47:30,581 --> 00:47:33,573
- What are you accusing me of?
- Did you?

443
00:47:33,741 --> 00:47:38,371
He didn't know,
or he wouId have had to tell us.

444
00:47:38,541 --> 00:47:43,934
Now our clients might pIead not
guilty and say they were ordered.

445
00:47:44,101 --> 00:47:47,093
Kendrick told them
not to touch Santiago.

446
00:47:47,261 --> 00:47:53,018
And then he toId Dawson and Downey
to give him a Code Red.

447
00:47:53,181 --> 00:47:57,459
23 marines and a highly decorated
Iieutenant disagree.

448
00:47:57,621 --> 00:48:02,649
- Why did Markinson go U.A?
- You'II never know.

449
00:48:02,821 --> 00:48:07,849
You know what Markinson did
for 1 7 years? CounterinteIligence.

450
00:48:08,021 --> 00:48:12,139
Markinson's gone.
There is no Markinson.

451
00:48:12,301 --> 00:48:16,613
Look Danny,
Jessep's star is on the rise.

452
00:48:16,781 --> 00:48:21,855
Division want to spare him
and the Corps any embarrassment.

453
00:48:22,021 --> 00:48:26,253
I'II knock it down to invoIuntary
manslaughter. Two years.

454
00:48:26,421 --> 00:48:29,697
No, we're going to court.

455
00:48:29,861 --> 00:48:35,618
You'II Iose. And if we go to court,
I'II have to go alI the way:

456
00:48:35,781 --> 00:48:40,332
Murder, conspiracy,
conduct unbecoming.

457
00:48:40,501 --> 00:48:45,131
Danny's got me by the baIIs here,
but not in the courtroom.

458
00:48:45,301 --> 00:48:51,820
He doesn't want to see them get Iife
if they couId be home in six months.

459
00:48:52,461 --> 00:48:57,489
That's the end of this negotiation.
See you at the arraignment.

460
00:49:01,501 --> 00:49:08,100
Here's the story: they're offering
invoiuntary manslaughter. Two years.

461
00:49:08,261 --> 00:49:12,618
You'II be home in six months.

462
00:49:12,781 --> 00:49:19,050
Wow! You're the greatest Iawyer in
the world! How can we thank you?

463
00:49:19,221 --> 00:49:24,853
Did you hear what I just said?
You'II be home in six months.

464
00:49:25,021 --> 00:49:28,457
I'm afraid we can't do that, sir.

465
00:49:28,621 --> 00:49:31,852
We can't make a deaI.

466
00:49:32,021 --> 00:49:37,937
We did nothing but our job.
I'Il accept the consequences.

467
00:49:38,101 --> 00:49:41,457
But l won't say l'm guiIty, sir.

468
00:49:41,621 --> 00:49:46,490
- Did she put you up to this?
- We have a code, sir.

469
00:49:46,661 --> 00:49:51,530
You and your code pIead not guiIty.
You'II be in jaiI for Iife.

470
00:49:51,701 --> 00:49:55,535
Do what I say,
and you'II be home in six months.

471
00:49:55,701 --> 00:50:00,695
Do it, HaroId.
Six months, it's nothing!

472
00:50:03,061 --> 00:50:06,849
- Permission to ...
- Speak! Jesus!

473
00:50:09,141 --> 00:50:14,898
What do we do then? After six months
we'lI be dishonourabIy discharged.

474
00:50:15,061 --> 00:50:19,418
- ProbabIy.
- What do we do then, sir?

475
00:50:21,301 --> 00:50:27,456
We joined the Marines because
we wanted to Iive by a certain code.

476
00:50:27,621 --> 00:50:32,854
You're asking us to say we have no
honour, that we're not marines!

477
00:50:33,021 --> 00:50:37,060
If what we did was wrong,
I'II accept my punishment.

478
00:50:37,221 --> 00:50:42,659
But l believe I did my job. I wilI
not dishonour myself, my unit -

479
00:50:42,821 --> 00:50:47,736
- or the Corps,
so that I can go home in six months.

480
00:50:47,901 --> 00:50:50,495
Sir!

481
00:50:56,181 --> 00:51:02,211
I'd Iike to taIk to Corporal Dawson
alone for a minute.

482
00:51:02,381 --> 00:51:06,499
Sergeant!

483
00:51:06,661 --> 00:51:10,893
- We'd like to go to another room.
- Sit down.

484
00:51:18,301 --> 00:51:24,058
You don't Iike me very much,
do you?

485
00:51:25,461 --> 00:51:29,613
Forget it, it doesn't matter.

486
00:51:34,501 --> 00:51:39,370
You know ...
Downey worships you.

487
00:51:41,541 --> 00:51:45,011
He'lI do whatever you do.

488
00:51:45,181 --> 00:51:49,572
Are you going to let this
happen to him because of a code?

489
00:51:49,741 --> 00:51:53,416
Do you think we were right?
Do you?

490
00:51:53,581 --> 00:51:57,813
I think you'd Iose.

491
00:51:57,981 --> 00:52:04,250
You're such a coward.
I can't beIieve you're in uniform.

492
00:52:04,421 --> 00:52:07,094
I won't be responsibIe for this.

493
00:52:07,301 --> 00:52:13,251
If you go to Leavenworth for Iife,
I don't give a shit!

494
00:52:13,421 --> 00:52:18,893
What about saIuting
an officer when he Ieaves the room?

495
00:52:29,101 --> 00:52:33,413
I don't beIieve it!
He"s going to jaiI to spite me!

496
00:52:33,581 --> 00:52:37,494
If he wants to jump off a cIiff,
that's his business.

497
00:52:37,661 --> 00:52:41,779
- How do l get him a new lawyer?
- At the arraignment.

498
00:52:41,941 --> 00:52:48,699
Just teII the judge
you want new counseI assigned.

499
00:52:49,621 --> 00:52:54,092
One thing, though.
Be sure and ask niceIy.

500
00:52:55,261 --> 00:53:00,619
- What do you want from me?
- I want you to make an argument.

501
00:53:00,781 --> 00:53:05,332
That didn't help Calley at My Lai,
or the Nazis at Nuremburg.

502
00:53:05,501 --> 00:53:08,573
Do you think that's the same -

503
00:53:08,741 --> 00:53:14,020
- as two teenagers executing an
order they didn't think wouId harm?

504
00:53:14,181 --> 00:53:18,857
Don't Iook now,
but you're making an argument.

505
00:53:19,021 --> 00:53:22,172
I'lI get them a new attorney.

506
00:53:22,341 --> 00:53:26,380
What are you afraid of?
You father's expectations?

507
00:53:26,541 --> 00:53:33,219
Spare me the psychobabble!
They'II just have another lawyer.

508
00:53:33,381 --> 00:53:37,499
They need you.
You know how to win.

509
00:53:37,661 --> 00:53:41,973
If you waIk away from this now,
you've sealed their fate.

510
00:53:42,141 --> 00:53:45,338
Their fate was seaIed
when Santiago died.

511
00:53:45,501 --> 00:53:50,052
- Do they have a case?
- You and Dawson are dreamers.

512
00:53:50,221 --> 00:53:53,930
lt's not what I beIieve,
but what I can prove.

513
00:53:54,101 --> 00:54:00,734
So, don't telI me what l know
or don't know. l know the Iaw!

514
00:54:03,461 --> 00:54:07,374
You're just a used-car saIesman.

515
00:54:07,541 --> 00:54:14,253
An ambulance-chaser with a rank.
You're nothing. Live with that.

516
00:54:19,381 --> 00:54:24,899
So I toId Duncan, ''If you want me
to take this to court, -

517
00:54:25,061 --> 00:54:28,417
- you'II get a year's paperwork -

518
00:54:28,581 --> 00:54:32,859
- because a 90-year-old
misread the Insurance Code.'"

519
00:54:33,021 --> 00:54:36,855
Fifteen minutes later,
he makes a deaI.

520
00:55:21,221 --> 00:55:25,180
AII rise.

521
00:55:29,821 --> 00:55:35,817
- Where are we?
- Docket nr. 41 1275 VR/5.

522
00:55:35,981 --> 00:55:40,736
The United States versus Corporal
Dawson and Private Downey.

523
00:55:40,901 --> 00:55:46,339
The accused are charged with murder,
conspiracy and conduct unbecoming.

524
00:55:46,501 --> 00:55:50,858
Does the defence
wish to enter a pIea?

525
00:55:55,141 --> 00:56:02,013
- They're not guiIty.
- Enter a pIea of ''not guiIty'".

526
00:56:02,181 --> 00:56:08,654
Adjourned untiI 10.00, three weeks
from today, when we wiII reconvene.

527
00:56:24,181 --> 00:56:31,576
Why would a Iieutenant with so
IittIe experience get a murder case?

528
00:56:33,541 --> 00:56:38,820
Would it be, so that it never sees
the inside of a courtroom?

529
00:56:38,981 --> 00:56:45,056
We'Il work at my apartment.
Jo, bring Iegal pads and pens.

530
00:56:45,221 --> 00:56:48,611
Sam, start a medical profile.

531
00:56:48,781 --> 00:56:52,820
Jo, get Dawson's, Downey's
and Santiago's conduct reports.

532
00:56:52,981 --> 00:56:58,931
I've only got Yoo-hoo and Cocoa
Puffs, so bring your own food.

533
00:57:04,741 --> 00:57:09,576
So this is
what a courtroom Iooks like!

534
00:57:16,341 --> 00:57:20,459
Did you speak
to your friend at the NIS?

535
00:57:20,621 --> 00:57:25,456
She said, if Markinson doesn't
want to be found, he won't be.

536
00:57:25,621 --> 00:57:29,978
I could be Markinson,
and you wouIdn't know.

537
00:57:30,141 --> 00:57:34,054
- Are you Markinson?
- No.

538
00:57:34,221 --> 00:57:39,056
/'m not Markinson.
That's two down.

539
00:57:40,901 --> 00:57:42,892
What?

540
00:57:43,461 --> 00:57:49,570
Now that JoAnne's on this ...
Do you stiII need me?

541
00:57:49,741 --> 00:57:54,610
They were ordered, Sam.
They didn't know it was ilIegaI.

542
00:57:54,781 --> 00:58:00,094
- Any decent person wouId have ...
- They can't question orders.

543
00:58:00,261 --> 00:58:04,698
What's the secret?
I give orders nobody obeys!

544
00:58:04,861 --> 00:58:10,731
We have softbaII and marching bands.
They risk getting shot at.

545
00:58:18,061 --> 00:58:22,134
I need you.
You're better at research than I am.

546
00:58:22,301 --> 00:58:26,613
And you know
how to prepare a wItness.

547
00:58:30,021 --> 00:58:35,095
I've got medicaI reports
and Chinese food. Let's eat first.

548
00:58:40,301 --> 00:58:43,452
What?

549
00:58:43,621 --> 00:58:48,536
Got any kung pau chicken?

550
00:58:48,701 --> 00:58:54,697
They can't prove there was poison.
Code Reds are normal at Guantanamo.

551
00:58:54,861 --> 00:59:00,140
And there was an order. Kendrick
gave it, they had no choice.

552
00:59:00,301 --> 00:59:04,738
- What about their motive?
- That doesn't make them guiIty.

553
00:59:04,901 --> 00:59:07,859
We'II deal with that Iater.

554
00:59:08,021 --> 00:59:13,095
We must show that Santiago couId
have died from something eIse.

555
00:59:13,261 --> 00:59:17,459
Jo, find out aII about
Iactic acidosis.

556
00:59:17,621 --> 00:59:24,015
This is Lt. GaIIoway, I'm trying
to find a Lt. CoI Markinson ...

557
00:59:24,181 --> 00:59:28,936
Doctor, was there any sign
of injury? Scrapes? Cuts?

558
00:59:29,141 --> 00:59:33,453
Bruises? Broken bones?
Any sign of violence?

559
00:59:33,621 --> 00:59:37,614
- Other than the dead body?
- l aIways waIk into that.

560
00:59:37,781 --> 00:59:42,172
He ordered me and Dawson
to give WiIIy a Code Red.

561
00:59:42,341 --> 00:59:48,576
The answers must come faster.
It's Iike he's searching for it.

562
00:59:48,741 --> 00:59:54,896
And caII him Private Santiago.
Wi//y is someone with a mother.

563
00:59:55,981 --> 01:00:01,339
The jury has seven men and two
women. AlI experienced officers.

564
01:00:01,541 --> 01:00:04,339
The women have no chiIdren.
Too bad.

565
01:00:04,501 --> 01:00:08,380
A jury trial
is about assigning blame.

566
01:00:08,541 --> 01:00:15,333
Santiago's dead. They want to know
who's to bIame. We say, Kendrick.

567
01:00:15,501 --> 01:00:20,859
This won't be won by the Iaw,
but by the Iawyers. So, poker faces.

568
01:00:21,021 --> 01:00:26,015
If something goes wrong,
don't hang your head or scribbIe.

569
01:00:26,181 --> 01:00:29,696
Look Iike you expected it.

570
01:00:29,861 --> 01:00:34,457
- Pass me documents ...
- ''SwiftIy, and don't Iook anxious.''

571
01:00:34,621 --> 01:00:38,739
That perfume
wrecks my concentration.

572
01:00:38,901 --> 01:00:42,257
l was taIking to Sam.

573
01:00:42,421 --> 01:00:46,812
- What time is it?
- Time to go home and sIeep.

574
01:00:46,981 --> 01:00:50,610
- Give me a ride?
- Sure.

575
01:00:52,381 --> 01:00:57,933
- You're a good man, CharIie Brown.
- See you in court, counseIIor.

576
01:01:02,941 --> 01:01:06,297
I know. We've had our differences.

577
01:01:06,461 --> 01:01:10,932
We both said things we didn't mean.

578
01:01:11,101 --> 01:01:17,131
If you've gained some respect
for me, I'm happy about that.

579
01:01:17,301 --> 01:01:21,419
But it's no big deaI.
You needn't say you Iike me.

580
01:01:22,061 --> 01:01:26,532
I was just going to tell you
to wear matching socks.

581
01:01:26,701 --> 01:01:29,693
Okay. Good tip.

582
01:01:30,461 --> 01:01:35,660
- We're ready.
- You'd better beIieve it.

583
01:01:43,781 --> 01:01:46,701
We're gonna get creamed.

584
01:02:16,221 --> 01:02:21,215
- You are gonna save our son?
- I'lI do my best.

585
01:02:21,381 --> 01:02:25,659
Danny,
meet Ginny MiIIer, Louden's aunt.

586
01:02:26,741 --> 01:02:29,539
You're Aunt Ginny?

587
01:02:30,581 --> 01:02:35,416
- I was expecting someone oIder.
- So was I.

588
01:02:39,861 --> 01:02:43,695
- Last chance. I'II fIip you for it.
- Too Iate.

589
01:02:51,781 --> 01:02:57,378
AIl having business with this
court martiaI, stand forward.

590
01:02:57,541 --> 01:03:00,817
ColoneI JuIius RandoIph presiding.

591
01:03:00,981 --> 01:03:06,180
Is the government prepared
to make an opening statement?

592
01:03:07,941 --> 01:03:15,575
On September 6th, the accused
entered P.F.C. Santiago's room.

593
01:03:15,741 --> 01:03:20,815
They woke him, tied him,
and forced a rag into his throat.

594
01:03:20,981 --> 01:03:26,499
A reaction caIIed Iactic acidosis
caused his Iungs to bleed.

595
01:03:26,661 --> 01:03:31,940
He drowned in his own blood,
and was dead at 00.37 a.m.

596
01:03:32,101 --> 01:03:36,856
These are
the undisputed facts of the case.

597
01:03:37,021 --> 01:03:42,049
What I"ve just toId you
is exactly what you will hear -

598
01:03:42,221 --> 01:03:46,612
- from CorporaI Dawson
and Private Downey.

599
01:03:46,781 --> 01:03:51,616
We wilI aIso show that
they soaked the rag in poison, -

600
01:03:51,781 --> 01:03:56,901
- and entered Santiago's room
with motive and intent to kiII.

601
01:03:57,061 --> 01:04:02,215
Lt. Kaffee is going to try
and work a IittIe magic here.

602
01:04:02,381 --> 01:04:07,899
He'II try a littIe misdirection.
Astonishing stories of rituaIs.

603
01:04:08,061 --> 01:04:14,011
DazzIe you with officiaI-sounding
terms Iike ''Code Red''.

604
01:04:14,181 --> 01:04:17,332
He may even try to cut
into a few officers.

605
01:04:17,501 --> 01:04:21,813
He has no evidence,
but it'Il be entertaining.

606
01:04:21,981 --> 01:04:27,897
But in the end, aII this magic
wilI not obscure the fact -

607
01:04:28,061 --> 01:04:34,694
- that WiIIy Santiago is dead,
and Dawson and Downey kiIled him.

608
01:04:34,861 --> 01:04:41,334
- These are the undisputed facts.
- Lt. Kaffee.

609
01:04:41,501 --> 01:04:48,737
It is futile to try and prove that
there was poison or intent to kilI.

610
01:04:48,901 --> 01:04:54,294
Dawson and Downey didn't go to
Santiago seeking vengeance.

611
01:04:54,501 --> 01:05:01,612
And they weren't looking for kicks.
They were ordered to do it.

612
01:05:02,181 --> 01:05:06,572
l'II say that again:
They were ordered to do it.

613
01:05:07,341 --> 01:05:13,177
In the real worId, or here in
Washington, that doesn't mean much.

614
01:05:13,341 --> 01:05:19,018
But if you're a marine
in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, -

615
01:05:19,181 --> 01:05:22,457
- you folIow orders,
or you pack your bags.

616
01:05:22,621 --> 01:05:30,972
Dawson and Downey are sitting here
because they did their job.

617
01:05:34,341 --> 01:05:41,099
- CaII the first witness.
- We caIl Mr. R.C. McGuire.

618
01:05:45,301 --> 01:05:47,417
Raise your right hand, pIease.

619
01:05:47,581 --> 01:05:52,974
Will you teII the truth, the whoIe
truth, and nothing but the truth?

620
01:05:53,141 --> 01:05:56,292
Yes.

621
01:05:56,461 --> 01:05:59,533
State your name and occupation.

622
01:05:59,701 --> 01:06:03,899
Robert C. McGuire,
SpeciaI Agent, NIS.

623
01:06:04,061 --> 01:06:10,170
Did you receive a Ietter from PFC
Santiago on the 3rd of September?

624
01:06:10,341 --> 01:06:16,974
Yes. It said that a member of the
unit had shot across the fenceIine.

625
01:06:17,141 --> 01:06:19,132
Was he named?

626
01:06:19,301 --> 01:06:26,298
No. I toId CoIoneI Jessep that l
would be coming down to investigate.

627
01:06:26,461 --> 01:06:31,171
OnIy one sentry
had a buIIet missing.

628
01:06:31,341 --> 01:06:36,096
- Who was that?
- CorporaI Harold Dawson.

629
01:06:38,661 --> 01:06:45,419
- What did Dawson say about this?
- That he was engaged by the enemy.

630
01:06:45,581 --> 01:06:48,220
- But you don't believe him?
- I'ts not ...

631
01:06:48,381 --> 01:06:52,533
Why was Dawson never charged?

632
01:06:54,301 --> 01:06:59,978
- There wasn't enough evidence.
- Thank you.

633
01:07:00,141 --> 01:07:06,933
Why was there not enough evidence?
You had the letter.

634
01:07:07,101 --> 01:07:13,336
Santiago was the onIy eyewitness.
I had no chance to interview him.

635
01:07:13,501 --> 01:07:18,529
- And now we'II never know, right?
- No.

636
01:07:19,941 --> 01:07:23,820
- No more questions.
- The witness is excused.

637
01:07:26,621 --> 01:07:32,491
CorporaI CarI Hammaker,
RSC Windward, 2nd PIatoon Bravo.

638
01:07:32,661 --> 01:07:39,134
Were you present at a meeting held
by Lt. Kendrick on September 6th?

639
01:07:39,301 --> 01:07:42,976
- Yes, sir.
- What was said there?

640
01:07:43,141 --> 01:07:46,133
Lt. Kendrick told us
we had an informer.

641
01:07:46,301 --> 01:07:51,580
That Santiago had reported to the
NIS on a member of our platoon.

642
01:07:51,741 --> 01:07:57,213
- Did that make you mad? TruthfuIIy?
- Yes, sir.

643
01:07:57,381 --> 01:08:02,171
- How mad?
- Santiago betrayed our code.

644
01:08:02,341 --> 01:08:06,698
Were other men aIso angry?
Dawson and Downey?

645
01:08:06,861 --> 01:08:11,935
Objection! The witness is asked
how my cIients fe/t on Sept. 6th.

646
01:08:12,101 --> 01:08:15,571
Sustained.

647
01:08:15,741 --> 01:08:21,816
Did Lieutenant Kendrick give you
a standing order at that meeting?

648
01:08:23,661 --> 01:08:26,858
He said, not to take
matters into our own hands.

649
01:08:27,021 --> 01:08:33,494
- What was the order?
- Santiago wasn't to be touched.

650
01:08:35,021 --> 01:08:37,615
Your witness.

651
01:08:37,781 --> 01:08:42,935
Were you in Dawson and Downey's
room five minutes Iater?

652
01:08:43,101 --> 01:08:47,538
- Thanks. No more questions.
- The witness is excused.

653
01:08:51,341 --> 01:08:53,650
CorporaI Raymond Thomas.

654
01:08:53,821 --> 01:08:59,179
Captain Ross is pIanning to caIl
the entire pIatoon.

655
01:08:59,381 --> 01:09:05,217
The platoon Ieader's instructions
are reIevant testimony.

656
01:09:05,381 --> 01:09:10,091
The defence concedes that aII 22
wiII confirm Hammaker's account.

657
01:09:10,261 --> 01:09:15,858
But none of them were in
Dawson and Downey's room at 16.20.

658
01:09:16,021 --> 01:09:20,253
- Captain?
- The government wiII concede that.

659
01:09:20,421 --> 01:09:26,690
Then we wilI adjourn. You can
caII your next witness tomorrow.

660
01:09:37,141 --> 01:09:41,692
- Let's go over the doctor again.
- It's the wrong approach.

661
01:09:41,861 --> 01:09:45,410
At 3.00 a.m., he didn't know
what kilIed Santiago.

662
01:09:45,581 --> 01:09:50,097
But after he met Jessep, he said
it was poison. He's Iying.

663
01:09:50,261 --> 01:09:54,777
Great! We can say,
''Liar, Iiar, pants on fire.''

664
01:09:54,941 --> 01:10:00,937
We can't prove coercion.
Let's go over what we have.

665
01:10:09,221 --> 01:10:12,736
Private Santiago was hospitaIized
at 00.12 , -

666
01:10:12,901 --> 01:10:16,530
- and was pronounced dead at 00.37.

667
01:10:16,701 --> 01:10:19,852
Doctor, what is Iactic acidosis?

668
01:10:20,021 --> 01:10:25,049
It arises if the muscIes and celIs
burn sugar instead of oxygen.

669
01:10:25,221 --> 01:10:28,531
It caused Santiago's Iungs to bIeed.

670
01:10:28,701 --> 01:10:33,855
How Iong does it take, before
the muscIes start burning sugar?

671
01:10:34,621 --> 01:10:40,059
- 20 to 30 minutes.
- What made it faster with Santiago?

672
01:10:40,221 --> 01:10:45,170
- Some kind of poison.
- The witness is specuIating!

673
01:10:45,341 --> 01:10:49,653
He is an expert medicaI witness.
It is not specuIation.

674
01:10:49,821 --> 01:10:55,214
He is not a criminologist.
The medicaI facts are inconcIusive.

675
01:10:55,381 --> 01:11:01,854
But I'm sure you don't mind
if we admit his opinion now.

676
01:11:02,021 --> 01:11:05,457
Not at aII, sir.

677
01:11:05,621 --> 01:11:11,730
- Was WiIIy Santiago poisoned?
- AbsoIuteIy.

678
01:11:11,901 --> 01:11:18,215
But you know that the coroner's
report shows no trace of poison?

679
01:11:18,381 --> 01:11:23,739
There are dozens of toxins
which are virtually undetectabIe.

680
01:11:23,901 --> 01:11:29,976
The nature of the acidosis
is the compeIIing factor here.

681
01:11:31,901 --> 01:11:39,376
CouId a person have a condition
that could speed up acidosis?

682
01:11:41,901 --> 01:11:45,530
- Is it possibIe?
- It's possibIe.

683
01:11:45,701 --> 01:11:49,011
What might
some of those conditions be?

684
01:11:49,181 --> 01:11:54,380
A coronary disorder
wouId make it more rapid.

685
01:11:54,541 --> 01:12:00,093
lf I had a coronary condition and
someone stuffed a rag in my mouth, -

686
01:12:00,261 --> 01:12:04,618
- would I stilI burn sugar
after the rag was taken out?

687
01:12:04,781 --> 01:12:07,454
lf it was very serious.

688
01:12:07,621 --> 01:12:11,739
CouId such a condition have
such mild initiaI symptoms, -

689
01:12:11,901 --> 01:12:15,974
- that a routine examination
might not reveaI them?

690
01:12:16,141 --> 01:12:21,215
- There would stiIl be symptoms.
- What kind?

691
01:12:21,381 --> 01:12:26,216
Chest pains?
Shortness of breath? Fatigue?

692
01:12:26,381 --> 01:12:29,259
Of course.

693
01:12:33,261 --> 01:12:37,618
- Is this your signature?
- Yes, it is.

694
01:12:37,781 --> 01:12:41,933
This is an order for Santiago
to be put on restricted duty.

695
01:12:42,101 --> 01:12:45,730
WouId you read your remarks?

696
01:12:45,901 --> 01:12:51,931
''Patient compIains of chest pains,
shortness of breath, and fatigue.''

697
01:12:52,101 --> 01:12:57,050
''Restricted from running distances
over five miIes.'"

698
01:12:58,261 --> 01:13:02,459
Couldn't it have been a
heart condition, not a poison, -

699
01:13:02,621 --> 01:13:06,455
- that caused the
rapid chemicaI reaction?

700
01:13:06,661 --> 01:13:09,698
- No.
- It's not possibIe?

701
01:13:09,861 --> 01:13:17,541
No. I examined Santiago thoroughIy
and gave him a cIean biII of heaIth.

702
01:13:17,701 --> 01:13:24,174
So it had to be poison. If you
give a man a cIean biII of heaIth, -

703
01:13:24,341 --> 01:13:28,414
- and he Iater dies,
you'd be in trouble, right?

704
01:13:28,581 --> 01:13:32,733
- Object! Move to strike!
- Sustained.

705
01:13:32,901 --> 01:13:36,371
I've no more questions, your honour.

706
01:13:36,541 --> 01:13:42,537
You've been a doctor for 1 7 years.
You are Chief of InternaI Medicine -

707
01:13:42,701 --> 01:13:46,740
- at a hospitaI
which has served 5,426 peopIe.

708
01:13:46,901 --> 01:13:51,417
In your professionaI opinion,
was Santiago poisoned?

709
01:13:51,581 --> 01:13:56,052
We ask that the doctor's testimony
be stricken from the record.

710
01:13:56,221 --> 01:14:01,659
-The court shouId disregard it.
-The objection's overruIed.

711
01:14:01,821 --> 01:14:06,497
We strenuously object,
and ask to confer with you -

712
01:14:06,661 --> 01:14:09,698
- before you ruIe on this objection.

713
01:14:09,861 --> 01:14:14,377
- The objection has been overruIed.
- Move to reconsider.

714
01:14:14,541 --> 01:14:19,615
The witness is an expert,
and the court wiIl hear his opinion!

715
01:14:23,781 --> 01:14:31,051
ln your expert professionaI opinion,
was WiIIy Santiago poisoned?

716
01:14:31,941 --> 01:14:36,696
- Yes.
- Thank you, sir. No more questions.

717
01:14:36,861 --> 01:14:40,649
You may step down.

718
01:14:42,581 --> 01:14:48,816
WhiIe we reserve the right to caII
further witnesses, government rests.

719
01:14:48,981 --> 01:14:55,534
We'II recess untiI Monday, when the
defence wiII calI its first witness.

720
01:15:06,301 --> 01:15:11,329
''I strenuously object."'
ls that how it works?

721
01:15:11,501 --> 01:15:15,380
''OverruIed!''
''No, I strenuous/y object!'"

722
01:15:15,541 --> 01:15:19,659
- Oh, then I'II reconsider!
- I got it on the record.

723
01:15:19,821 --> 01:15:24,497
You object once , so we can say
he's not a criminologist.

724
01:15:24,701 --> 01:15:31,220
If you keep after it, it looks Iike
a bunch of fancy Iawyer tricks.

725
01:15:31,381 --> 01:15:36,535
- The judge caIIed him an expert!
- Sam, she made a mistake.

726
01:15:38,101 --> 01:15:42,379
I'Il go calI my wife.
I'II see you tonight.

727
01:15:43,701 --> 01:15:48,092
- Why do you hate them?
- They beat up a weakIing.

728
01:15:48,261 --> 01:15:54,496
The rest is just coffee-house crap.
They tortured a weaker kid!

729
01:15:54,661 --> 01:15:59,257
They kilIed him,
because he couIdn't run very fast!

730
01:15:59,421 --> 01:16:04,779
- Everybody take the night off.
- I'm sorry ...

731
01:16:04,941 --> 01:16:10,732
We've been working 20 hours a day.
Go see your wife and daughter.

732
01:16:10,901 --> 01:16:17,613
Jo, go and do ... whatever you do
when you're not here.

733
01:16:17,861 --> 01:16:23,493
It's Saturday tomorrow?
We start at ten.

734
01:16:26,021 --> 01:16:29,900
Why do you like them so much?

735
01:16:32,301 --> 01:16:38,570
'Cause they stand on a waII and say:
"'Nothing's gonna hurt you tonight."'

736
01:16:43,101 --> 01:16:48,619
Don't worry about the doctor.
This trial starts Monday.

737
01:17:13,981 --> 01:17:17,018
Sorry to bother you.
I should have calIed first.

738
01:17:17,181 --> 01:17:22,301
No, I'm just watching the ball game.
Come on in.

739
01:17:35,461 --> 01:17:40,819
How wouId you feeI
if l took you to dinner tonight?

740
01:17:40,981 --> 01:17:43,779
Is this a date?

741
01:17:43,941 --> 01:17:48,969
It sounded Iike you were
asking me out on a date.

742
01:17:49,741 --> 01:17:54,451
Do you like seafood?
I know a good seafood place.

743
01:18:00,501 --> 01:18:06,258
My third case was a ''drunk
and disorderIy''. lt took nine weeks.

744
01:18:06,421 --> 01:18:12,132
- Nine weeks? And the plea bargain?
- 15 days.

745
01:18:13,901 --> 01:18:19,453
- You sure hustIed them.
- I got shifted to lnternaI Affairs.

746
01:18:19,621 --> 01:18:23,853
But I have two medaIs
and two Ietters of commendation.

747
01:18:24,021 --> 01:18:28,492
Why are you aIways
giving me your rsum?

748
01:18:30,581 --> 01:18:34,415
- I want you to think I'm good.
- l do.

749
01:18:34,581 --> 01:18:37,891
No, you don't.

750
01:18:39,901 --> 01:18:47,216
You're an exceptionaI lawyer.
The court members respond to you.

751
01:18:47,381 --> 01:18:52,409
You"lI convince them. Dawson and
Downey wilI owe you their Iives.

752
01:18:55,901 --> 01:18:58,461
Jo ...

753
01:18:59,341 --> 01:19:06,258
You've got to prepare for Iosing.
Ross's statement was aII true.

754
01:19:06,421 --> 01:19:13,611
Even if it mattered to the court,
I can't prove they were ordered.

755
01:19:13,781 --> 01:19:21,290
AlI we have is the testimony of
two people accused of murder.

756
01:19:22,461 --> 01:19:28,730
- We'Il find Markinson.
- We're gonna Iose, huge.

757
01:19:31,941 --> 01:19:36,935
Corporal Barnes, Windward Barracks,
Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

758
01:19:37,101 --> 01:19:41,174
For what reasons might a marine
receive a Code Red?

759
01:19:41,341 --> 01:19:48,258
Being Iate, being disorderly,
falIing back on a run ...

760
01:19:48,421 --> 01:19:54,337
- Have you ever received a Code Red?
- Yes. I dropped my weapon.

761
01:19:54,501 --> 01:20:01,100
It was over 100 degrees. My paIms
were sweaty and I hadn't used resin.

762
01:20:01,261 --> 01:20:05,698
- What happened?
- They threw a bIanket over me.

763
01:20:05,861 --> 01:20:11,094
They punched me on the arms
and poured glue on my hands.

764
01:20:11,261 --> 01:20:15,937
And it worked.
I've never dropped my weapon since.

765
01:20:16,101 --> 01:20:22,415
Was Private Santiago ever late?
Was his barracks ever disorderIy?

766
01:20:22,581 --> 01:20:24,856
Did he faII back on runs?

767
01:20:25,021 --> 01:20:29,936
Did he ever receive a Code Red
before September 6th?

768
01:20:30,101 --> 01:20:33,855
No, never.

769
01:20:35,021 --> 01:20:41,290
You got a Code Red just for
sweating. Why not Santiago?

770
01:20:42,741 --> 01:20:47,610
- Dawson wouldn't aIIow it, sir.
- Dawson wouIdn't allow it.

771
01:20:47,781 --> 01:20:53,219
The guys taIked tough,
but they were too afraid of Dawson.

772
01:20:53,381 --> 01:20:59,934
- Objection. SpecuIation.
- Did you want to punish Santiago?

773
01:21:00,101 --> 01:21:05,334
- Why didn't you?
- Dawson wouId have kicked my butt.

774
01:21:05,501 --> 01:21:09,096
Captain Ross wiII ask you
some questions.

775
01:21:09,261 --> 01:21:16,019
CorporaI Barnes, this is the Marine
Recruit OutIine. Do you know it?

776
01:21:16,181 --> 01:21:22,256
Have you read it? Good.
Look up ''Code Reds'', pIease.

777
01:21:23,021 --> 01:21:27,412
- Sir?
- Just find the page with Code Reds.

778
01:21:29,221 --> 01:21:34,534
'"Code Red"' is just a term we use
down at GlTMO. l don't know ...

779
01:21:34,701 --> 01:21:37,898
Oh. We're in Iuck, then!

780
01:21:39,781 --> 01:21:44,093
''Standard Operating Procedure.
RSC, Guantamo Bay, Cuba.''

781
01:21:44,261 --> 01:21:49,779
- Can we find ''Code Red'' in there?
- No, sir.

782
01:21:49,941 --> 01:21:55,618
I'm a marine. Is there no book,
no set of orders or reguIations -

783
01:21:55,781 --> 01:21:59,979
- teIIing me that one of my
duties is to perform Code Reds?

784
01:22:00,741 --> 01:22:03,301
No book, sir.

785
01:22:03,461 --> 01:22:07,215
No further questions.

786
01:22:07,381 --> 01:22:12,136
WouId you find the page that says
where the mess halI is?

787
01:22:12,301 --> 01:22:16,499
That's not in the book, sir.

788
01:22:16,661 --> 01:22:22,452
- You mean you've never had a meal?
- Three square meaIs a day, sir.

789
01:22:23,221 --> 01:22:27,851
How did you find the mess haII,
if it's not in this book?

790
01:22:30,301 --> 01:22:36,376
- I guess I just foIIowed the crowd.
- No more questions.

791
01:22:36,541 --> 01:22:40,056
CorporaI Barnes, you may step down.

792
01:22:45,381 --> 01:22:50,535
We do our finaI Kendrick review
tonight. I want to sIam-dunk him.

793
01:23:01,621 --> 01:23:05,739
- Hey, Luther.
- Admiral! How's the big case?

794
01:23:05,901 --> 01:23:08,973
- Nose to the grindstone.
- No fIies on you.

795
01:23:09,141 --> 01:23:13,180
WeII, it ain't over
'tiII the fat Iady sings.

796
01:23:13,341 --> 01:23:19,371
- You can say that again.
- Not 'tiII the fat Iady sings.

797
01:23:19,541 --> 01:23:22,977
I waIked into that one.

798
01:23:32,741 --> 01:23:37,940
- Jesus Christ!
- You Ieft the door unlocked.

799
01:23:38,101 --> 01:23:42,891
You scared the shit out of me.
You're under subpoena.

800
01:23:43,061 --> 01:23:51,014
And the Iives of two marines are in
your hands. I have to heIp you.

801
01:23:51,181 --> 01:23:55,697
What do you know?
Was it a Code Red?

802
01:23:55,861 --> 01:23:59,934
Did Kendrick give the order?
Did you witness it? Did you?

803
01:24:00,101 --> 01:24:03,252
- No.
- Then you don't know shit.

804
01:24:03,421 --> 01:24:06,254
He was never gonna be transferred.

805
01:24:11,141 --> 01:24:16,852
- Jessep wanted him ''trained"'.
- But you signed the transfer order.

806
01:24:17,021 --> 01:24:22,778
I signed them when you got to Cuba,
five days after Santiago's death.

807
01:24:24,301 --> 01:24:30,934
I'lI get you immunity. In four days
you can teII this to the court.

808
01:24:31,101 --> 01:24:35,140
I'II check you into a motel.
We'II start from the beginning.

809
01:24:35,301 --> 01:24:39,010
I don't want a deal, or immunity.

810
01:24:39,181 --> 01:24:45,131
l'm not proud of what I have done,
nor of what I am doing.

811
01:24:46,301 --> 01:24:50,260
- Where is he?
- The Downtown Lodge.

812
01:24:50,421 --> 01:24:56,860
- My clearance code is 41 15273.
- I don't have a cIearance code.

813
01:24:57,541 --> 01:25:03,457
He aIso says Jessep's lying about
the first flight being at 6.00 a.m.

814
01:25:03,621 --> 01:25:09,730
Markinson says there was one seven
hours earlier. Did you hear that?

815
01:25:09,901 --> 01:25:16,170
- lsn't there a record of fIights?
- You need the Tower Chief's log.

816
01:25:16,341 --> 01:25:20,254
- We're gonna win.
- Jo, we don't know anything yet.

817
01:25:20,421 --> 01:25:23,538
You take care of Downey,
I'II taIk to Ross.

818
01:25:28,301 --> 01:25:33,329
Hi, Danny. Nice work today.
The redirect on Barnes!

819
01:25:33,501 --> 01:25:37,619
- I have Markinson.
- Where is he?

820
01:25:37,781 --> 01:25:41,899
ln a moteI room in Northeast,
under guard.

821
01:25:42,061 --> 01:25:49,172
The transfer order is phoney. And
Jessep Iied about the first fIight.

822
01:25:49,341 --> 01:25:54,461
I'm gonna put Kendrick
on the stand and have some fun.

823
01:25:54,621 --> 01:25:59,251
If you accuse Kendrick or Jessep
without evidence, -

824
01:25:59,421 --> 01:26:06,372
- you'Il be court-martiaIIed,
and that wiII go on your record.

825
01:26:08,061 --> 01:26:14,933
Markinson won't hoId up, he's crazy.
l'm just telIing you to help you.

826
01:26:15,101 --> 01:26:21,336
And I think you're aII insane,
and your code of honour is shit!

827
01:26:21,501 --> 01:26:25,699
Don't Iump me in
with Kendrick and Jessep.

828
01:26:25,861 --> 01:26:29,979
Your cIients don't belong in jaiI,
but it's not my decision.

829
01:26:30,141 --> 01:26:37,217
I represent the government without
prejudice, and my cIient has a case.

830
01:26:41,101 --> 01:26:44,218
Please acknowIedge that
I've informed you -

831
01:26:44,381 --> 01:26:48,772
- of the consequences of accusing
an officer without evidence.

832
01:26:49,541 --> 01:26:53,329
I've been so advised.

833
01:26:55,421 --> 01:27:02,020
You got bulIied into that courtroom.
By everyone. By Dawson. By GaIIoway.

834
01:27:02,181 --> 01:27:05,537
Shit, l practicaIIy dared you.

835
01:27:05,701 --> 01:27:10,821
And you were bullied
by the memory of a dead Iawyer.

836
01:27:14,821 --> 01:27:19,611
You're a Iousy fucking
softbaII pIayer, Jack!

837
01:27:21,061 --> 01:27:26,499
Your boys are going down, Danny.
l can't stop it any more.

838
01:27:30,181 --> 01:27:35,414
- Was Santiago a good marine?
- l'd say he was average.

839
01:27:35,581 --> 01:27:42,612
Your proficiency and conduct reports
aII indicate he was beIow average.

840
01:27:45,581 --> 01:27:52,020
He was beIow average, but l don't
want to trampIe on his grave.

841
01:27:53,141 --> 01:27:59,580
- l know, but you're under oath.
- I'm aware of my oath.

842
01:27:59,741 --> 01:28:04,531
Here are your Iast three
reports for CorporaI Dawson.

843
01:28:04,701 --> 01:28:10,537
He rated exceptional twice,
but on June 9th he's beIow average.

844
01:28:10,701 --> 01:28:14,535
- l'd Iike to discuss that.
- Fine.

845
01:28:14,701 --> 01:28:18,171
Dawson scored perfect at
Infantry School.

846
01:28:18,341 --> 01:28:23,210
But unIike most of his cIass,
he hasn't been promoted.

847
01:28:23,381 --> 01:28:28,091
- Was this report the reason?
- I'm sure it was.

848
01:28:28,261 --> 01:28:32,334
- Do you know why he got this grade?
- No.

849
01:28:32,501 --> 01:28:36,130
I have many men.
I write many reports.

850
01:28:36,301 --> 01:28:41,739
Do you recaII
an incident with PFC Curtis BeII?

851
01:28:41,901 --> 01:28:46,213
- He stoIe from the Officers' CIub.
- Yes.

852
01:28:46,381 --> 01:28:50,340
Did you report him
to the proper authorities?

853
01:28:50,501 --> 01:28:55,450
I have two books by my bed:
the Marine Code and the BibIe.

854
01:28:55,621 --> 01:29:00,695
The only proper authorities I know
are Col. Jessep and God.

855
01:29:02,181 --> 01:29:07,301
Then you don't recognise this court
as a proper authority?

856
01:29:07,461 --> 01:29:12,171
- Objection. Argumentative.
- Sustained. Watch yourseIf!

857
01:29:12,341 --> 01:29:17,859
- Did you report BeII?
- I thought very highIy of him.

858
01:29:18,021 --> 01:29:24,494
- l didn't want to charge him.
- You wanted it handIed in the unit?

859
01:29:26,221 --> 01:29:32,296
- Yes, l most certainIy did.
- Do you know what a Code Red is?

860
01:29:32,461 --> 01:29:35,498
- Have you ever ordered one?
- No.

861
01:29:35,661 --> 01:29:43,773
Did you order that Private BelI
get nothing but water for a week?

862
01:29:43,941 --> 01:29:48,332
You're distorting the truth.
He was on barracks restriction.

863
01:29:48,501 --> 01:29:55,213
He had water and vitamins.
His heaIth was never in danger.

864
01:29:55,381 --> 01:30:00,501
l'm sure it was IoveIy for him.
But it was on your orders.

865
01:30:00,661 --> 01:30:04,620
- You denied him food?
- Yes, I did.

866
01:30:04,781 --> 01:30:10,936
- WouId this be caIled a Code Red?
- No.

867
01:30:11,101 --> 01:30:16,175
WouId the other 478 marines
consider it a Code Red?

868
01:30:16,341 --> 01:30:20,732
The witness can't know what
478 other men would say.

869
01:30:20,901 --> 01:30:26,771
These questions are argumentative,
and irreIevant badgering.

870
01:30:26,941 --> 01:30:31,059
Sustained. I wouId remind you -

871
01:30:31,221 --> 01:30:36,136
- that the witness has
an impeccabIe service record.

872
01:30:36,301 --> 01:30:43,412
Was Dawson rated beIow average
for sneaking food to Private BeII?

873
01:30:43,581 --> 01:30:48,177
- Object!
- Not so fast. Lieutenant?

874
01:30:48,341 --> 01:30:55,179
Dawson was given a below average
rating for committing a crime.

875
01:30:55,341 --> 01:30:59,334
What crime did he commit?

876
01:31:00,101 --> 01:31:06,017
Lt. Kendrick, Dawson brought
a hungry guy some food.

877
01:31:06,181 --> 01:31:11,130
- What crime did he commit?
- Disobeying an order.

878
01:31:11,301 --> 01:31:16,534
So, because he made a decision about
the weIfare of a marine -

879
01:31:16,701 --> 01:31:20,216
- that confIicted with your order,
he was punished.

880
01:31:20,381 --> 01:31:23,498
Dawson disobeyed an order!

881
01:31:23,661 --> 01:31:28,212
It wasn't a reaI order, was it?
lt's peacetime!

882
01:31:28,381 --> 01:31:31,453
He wasn't asked
to advance on a beachhead.

883
01:31:31,621 --> 01:31:38,572
SureIy a marine of his inteIIigence
couId distinguish important orders -

884
01:31:38,741 --> 01:31:42,529
- from those that might be
moralIy questionabIe?

885
01:31:44,061 --> 01:31:51,172
Can Dawson determine on his own,
which orders to folIow?

886
01:31:51,341 --> 01:31:55,380
- No, he cannot.
- He Iearned that?

887
01:31:55,541 --> 01:31:59,898
- I wouId think so.
- You know so, don't you?

888
01:32:02,341 --> 01:32:09,053
FinaIIy : If you had ordered Dawson
to give Santiago a Code Red ...

889
01:32:09,221 --> 01:32:13,180
- I toId them not to touch him!
- WouId he dare disobey?

890
01:32:13,341 --> 01:32:17,175
- Don't answer that!
- I'm through.

891
01:32:17,341 --> 01:32:25,533
Did you order Dawson and Downey
to give WiIIy Santiago a Code Red?

892
01:32:26,341 --> 01:32:30,541
- Lieutenant Kendrick ...
- No, I did not.

893
01:32:34,261 --> 01:32:37,014
What's the word?

894
01:32:37,181 --> 01:32:43,700
l have the Tower Chief's Iog.
Jessep's teIIing the truth.

895
01:32:54,381 --> 01:32:58,818
- Working late tonight, Lieutenant?
- Oh, yeah ...

896
01:33:01,541 --> 01:33:05,011
There was no fIight at 1 1 o'clock!

897
01:33:05,181 --> 01:33:11,939
The first flight Ieft at 23.00, and
arrived at Andrews at 2.00 a.m.

898
01:33:12,101 --> 01:33:15,138
Then why isn't it in the Iog?

899
01:33:16,981 --> 01:33:22,658
- Jessep.
- He fixed the Iogbook?

900
01:33:22,821 --> 01:33:28,691
I can prove that a pIane Ianded.
l'lI get the Iog from Andrews.

901
01:33:28,861 --> 01:33:33,491
- You won't find anything.
- He can make a fIight disappear?

902
01:33:34,061 --> 01:33:41,820
Jessep is about to join the NSC.
He knows how to sidestep landmines.

903
01:33:41,981 --> 01:33:46,975
- He can't sidestep you.
- You stiII want me to witness?

904
01:33:47,141 --> 01:33:51,976
Thursday morning. Ten o'cIock.

905
01:33:54,141 --> 01:33:57,770
Someone must know about the fIight.

906
01:33:57,941 --> 01:34:03,811
Do you know how many pIanes
take off and land every day?

907
01:34:03,981 --> 01:34:10,375
- No one wiIl remember it.
- Forget the fIight.

908
01:34:10,541 --> 01:34:15,171
Markinson wiII testify that
the transfer was forged.

909
01:34:15,341 --> 01:34:18,890
That and Downey's testimony
wiII be enough.

910
01:34:24,381 --> 01:34:28,169
Why did you go
into Santiago's room that night?

911
01:34:28,341 --> 01:34:33,290
- To give him a Code Red.
- Why did you do that?

912
01:34:33,861 --> 01:34:40,778
I was ordered to by
Lieutenant Jonathan James Kendrick.

913
01:34:41,901 --> 01:34:45,814
You're gonna do fine.

914
01:34:45,981 --> 01:34:51,419
- Can we rejoin the platoon soon?
- AbsoIuteIy.

915
01:34:54,541 --> 01:34:59,740
Remember the order of the
questions. And use smaII words.

916
01:34:59,901 --> 01:35:05,498
Just go slow.
And get him off as fast as you can.

917
01:35:05,661 --> 01:35:09,893
What? It's gonna be fine.

918
01:35:10,701 --> 01:35:16,173
Dear Mr. and Mrs. Santiago,
/ was Wi//iam's executive officer.

919
01:35:16,341 --> 01:35:19,572
/ knew your son on/y by name.

920
01:35:20,661 --> 01:35:25,212
Soon, the tria/ of the two men
who ki//ed him wi// be over, -

921
01:35:25,381 --> 01:35:31,490
- and thejury wi// try to offer you
an exp/anation for his death.

922
01:35:31,661 --> 01:35:37,258
/'ve done what / can
to bring the truth to /ight.

923
01:35:37,421 --> 01:35:42,575
But your son is dead because
/ wasn"t strong enough to stop it.

924
01:35:42,741 --> 01:35:48,418
Lieutenant Co/one/ Markinson,
United States Marine Corps.

925
01:35:53,421 --> 01:35:56,891
PIease teII us one Iast time:

926
01:35:57,061 --> 01:36:02,738
Why did you go to Santiago's room
on the night of September 6th?

927
01:36:02,901 --> 01:36:07,053
A Code Red was ordered
by PIatoon Commander Kendrick.

928
01:36:07,221 --> 01:36:11,009
Thank you. Your witness.

929
01:36:15,221 --> 01:36:21,979
According to the log,
you were at post 39 until 16.00.

930
01:36:22,141 --> 01:36:28,376
- They keep that Iog pretty good.
- How far is post 39 from barracks?

931
01:36:28,541 --> 01:36:34,537
- It's a ways, sir. lt's a hike.
- About how far by jeep?

932
01:36:38,101 --> 01:36:42,094
- Ever had to waIk it?
- Yes sir, that day.

933
01:36:42,261 --> 01:36:46,652
The pick-up private ...
we calI him that ...

934
01:36:46,821 --> 01:36:50,609
... aIso 'cause he can get the girIs.

935
01:36:50,781 --> 01:36:57,619
He got a fIat tyre at post 39, so
we had to jog back to barracks.

936
01:36:57,781 --> 01:37:04,129
If it's 10-15 minutes by jeep,
it must be an hour on foot, right?

937
01:37:04,301 --> 01:37:09,978
- We did it in 45 minutes, sir.
- Not bad.

938
01:37:10,141 --> 01:37:16,296
You've said your assault on Santiago
was ordered by Lt. Kendrick -

939
01:37:16,461 --> 01:37:21,091
- in your room at 16.20, right?

940
01:37:21,261 --> 01:37:28,770
- Yes, sir.
- But you weren't back before 16.45.

941
01:37:28,941 --> 01:37:35,050
So how couId you be
in your room at 16.20?

942
01:37:35,621 --> 01:37:38,613
WeII, sir, there was a blowout ...

943
01:37:38,781 --> 01:37:43,411
Did you actuaIIy hear
Lt. Kendriok order a Code Red?

944
01:37:43,581 --> 01:37:49,338
- HaI said ...
- Did you actuaIIy hear the order?

945
01:37:50,301 --> 01:37:55,216
- No, sir.
- I'd Iike to request a recess.

946
01:37:55,381 --> 01:37:59,852
- The witness has rights!
- He has been read his rights.

947
01:38:00,021 --> 01:38:05,049
Why did you go to Santiago's room?
Did Dawson teII you to?

948
01:38:05,221 --> 01:38:09,931
- Don't look at him!
- Answer the captain's question.

949
01:38:11,861 --> 01:38:18,653
Yes. I was given an order by
CorporaI Dawson, and I foIIowed it.

950
01:38:39,381 --> 01:38:42,896
Where do you think he is?

951
01:38:43,061 --> 01:38:50,615
As far as Downey was concerned,
it was an order from Kendrick.

952
01:38:54,621 --> 01:38:59,172
- Danny, I'm sorry ...
- Don't worry about it.

953
01:38:59,341 --> 01:39:04,574
AII we need to do is caII someone
to taIk about impIied orders, -

954
01:39:04,741 --> 01:39:07,130
- or caII Downey back first.

955
01:39:07,301 --> 01:39:13,649
Or how about getting Dawson charged
with the Kennedy assassination?

956
01:39:15,381 --> 01:39:22,298
- Are you drunk?
- Pretty much. Yeah.

957
01:39:22,461 --> 01:39:25,851
I'II put on a pot of coffee.

958
01:39:27,101 --> 01:39:32,255
She's gonna make coffee?
That's nice.

959
01:39:35,901 --> 01:39:41,851
Downey wasn't in his room.
He wasn't even there.

960
01:39:42,021 --> 01:39:46,617
That was important information,
don't you think?

961
01:39:47,341 --> 01:39:51,732
Danny, it was a setback.
And I'm sorry.

962
01:39:51,901 --> 01:39:55,814
We fix it, and move on to Markinson.

963
01:39:55,981 --> 01:39:59,610
Markinson's dead.

964
01:40:03,101 --> 01:40:07,253
You reaIIy got to hand it
to those marshaIs.

965
01:40:07,421 --> 01:40:14,338
He didn't hang himseIf by his Iaces,
or slash himseIf with a butterknife.

966
01:40:15,421 --> 01:40:21,291
He got into fuII dress uniform,
drew a nickIe-pIated pistoi, -

967
01:40:21,461 --> 01:40:26,979
- and fired a buIIet into his mouth.

968
01:40:28,181 --> 01:40:32,618
Since we're out of witnesses,
I thought I'd drink a Iittle.

969
01:40:32,781 --> 01:40:37,696
- l stiII think we can win.
- Maybe you shouId drink a Iittle.

970
01:40:37,861 --> 01:40:42,491
In the morning,
we'II ask for 24 hours deIay.

971
01:40:42,661 --> 01:40:48,133
- Why?
- To subpoena CoIoneI Jessep.

972
01:40:48,301 --> 01:40:53,819
No, Jo! Your passion is compeIIing,
but useIess.

973
01:40:53,981 --> 01:40:59,772
Louden Downey
needed a tria/ lawyer today.

974
01:40:59,941 --> 01:41:04,059
You chicken shit!
You just want an excuse to give up.

975
01:41:05,181 --> 01:41:07,172
It's over!

976
01:41:07,341 --> 01:41:12,051
Why did you ask Jessep
for the transfer order?

977
01:41:12,221 --> 01:41:18,171
- I wanted it!
- You couId have got it anywhere.

978
01:41:18,341 --> 01:41:22,732
You just wanted
to see Jessep's reaction.

979
01:41:22,901 --> 01:41:28,612
Your instinct was right.
Now Iet's caII Jessep, and end this.

980
01:41:28,781 --> 01:41:34,811
- What possible good wouId that do?
- He ordered the Code Red.

981
01:41:34,981 --> 01:41:41,011
He did? That's great!
And of course, you have proof?

982
01:41:41,181 --> 01:41:47,529
- You missed that day at Law School?
- Get it from him.

983
01:41:47,701 --> 01:41:51,740
We get it from him!
Yes, no probIem.

984
01:41:51,901 --> 01:41:55,940
CoIoneI, didn't you
order a Code Red on Santiago?

985
01:41:56,101 --> 01:42:00,094
Sorry, time's up!
What do the losers get?

986
01:42:00,261 --> 01:42:04,220
For the defendants,
Iife at Fort Leavenworth!

987
01:42:04,381 --> 01:42:09,899
And for defence counseI Kaffee:
That's right! A court martiaI!

988
01:42:10,061 --> 01:42:15,260
After accusing a decorated officer
of conspiracy and perjury, -

989
01:42:15,421 --> 01:42:18,777
- Kaffee can expect a career -

990
01:42:18,941 --> 01:42:23,969
- teaching typewriter
maintenance at a women's schooI!

991
01:42:24,141 --> 01:42:29,932
Thank you for playing ''FoIlow the
Advice of the GaIacticaIIy Stupid.''

992
01:42:50,861 --> 01:42:55,139
I'm sorry I Iost you
your steak knives.

993
01:43:10,181 --> 01:43:13,696
Stop cIeaning up.

994
01:43:15,541 --> 01:43:19,580
Sam, stop cIeaning up.

995
01:43:26,861 --> 01:43:31,651
- You want a drink?
- Yeah.

996
01:43:47,061 --> 01:43:51,896
Is your father proud of you?
I'II bet he is.

997
01:43:52,661 --> 01:43:58,213
I'Il bet he bores the shit out of
neighbours and reIatives:

998
01:43:58,381 --> 01:44:04,217
"'Sam's got a big case.
He's making an argument.''

999
01:44:08,461 --> 01:44:14,730
My father would have enjoyed
seeing me graduate from Law SchooI.

1000
01:44:15,981 --> 01:44:19,894
He wouId have Iiked that a lot.

1001
01:44:21,061 --> 01:44:26,215
I wrote a paper about your father
in coIIege.

1002
01:44:26,861 --> 01:44:32,094
- One of the best triaI lawyers.
- Yes, he was.

1003
01:44:32,261 --> 01:44:37,096
But if I were Dawson and Downey,
and had to choose you or him, -

1004
01:44:37,261 --> 01:44:40,219
- I'd choose you any day.

1005
01:44:40,381 --> 01:44:45,899
You shouId have seen yourseIf
thunder away at Kendrick.

1006
01:44:46,541 --> 01:44:51,092
- WouId you put Jessep on the stand?
- No.

1007
01:44:51,661 --> 01:44:59,375
- Do you think my father would?
- With the evidence we have? Never.

1008
01:44:59,541 --> 01:45:02,772
But we can't get around this :

1009
01:45:02,941 --> 01:45:10,291
Neither LioneI Kaffee nor
Sam Weinberg are Iead counseI here.

1010
01:45:10,461 --> 01:45:16,696
So there's reaIIy onIy one question:
What wouId you do?

1011
01:45:22,741 --> 01:45:29,897
Jo, get in the car.
JoAnne, pIease get in the car!

1012
01:45:31,301 --> 01:45:38,252
JoAnne! I apoIogise. I was angry.
l'm sorry about what l said.

1013
01:45:38,421 --> 01:45:42,972
I'm going to put Jessep
on the stand!

1014
01:46:00,301 --> 01:46:04,533
- What do you suggest?
- Use the phoney transfer order.

1015
01:46:04,701 --> 01:46:10,219
- Our witness to that is dead.
- A probIem, to a Iesser attorney!

1016
01:46:10,381 --> 01:46:15,375
Last night he was swimming in
Jack Daniels, today he's Superman!

1017
01:46:15,541 --> 01:46:20,057
I'm getting my second wind.
Sit down, both of you.

1018
01:46:20,221 --> 01:46:24,214
Jessep toId Kendrick
to order a Code Red.

1019
01:46:24,381 --> 01:46:29,819
For us to win,
Jessep has to say he gave the order.

1020
01:46:29,981 --> 01:46:36,216
- And you can get him to say that?
- I think he wants to say it!

1021
01:46:36,381 --> 01:46:39,532
He made a decision, and that's it!

1022
01:46:39,701 --> 01:46:45,412
He eats breakfast 300 yards from
4,000 Cubans trained to kiII him.

1023
01:46:45,581 --> 01:46:50,177
No one teIIs him how to
run his unit. Least of aII me.

1024
01:46:50,341 --> 01:46:54,857
I'lI lead him
right where he's dying to go.

1025
01:46:55,021 --> 01:46:59,333
That's the pIan?
How are you going to do it?

1026
01:46:59,501 --> 01:47:05,258
I've no idea. Where's my bat?
I think better with it.

1027
01:47:05,421 --> 01:47:09,937
I put it in the cIoset.
I was tripping on it.

1028
01:47:10,101 --> 01:47:12,661
Never put that bat in the cIoset!

1029
01:47:26,901 --> 01:47:34,854
- I'm going to the office.
- He does think better with the bat!

1030
01:47:55,381 --> 01:47:59,533
- He//o?
- Sam, l need you to do something.

1031
01:48:02,541 --> 01:48:08,093
- What's going on?
- l'm going out to Andrews.

1032
01:48:28,461 --> 01:48:32,579
- Did Sam get the guys?
- Yes.

1033
01:48:32,741 --> 01:48:36,859
Can I talk to you for a second?

1034
01:48:47,461 --> 01:48:50,533
How are you feeIing?

1035
01:48:50,701 --> 01:48:55,491
l think Jessep
wiIl have his hands fuII.

1036
01:48:56,701 --> 01:49:00,899
Listen Danny,
when you're out there today, -

1037
01:49:01,061 --> 01:49:07,660
- if you feeI Iike
he's not going to say it, -

1038
01:49:07,821 --> 01:49:13,214
- don't go for it.
You couId get into troubIe.

1039
01:49:13,381 --> 01:49:17,772
I'm with InternaI Affairs. I know.

1040
01:49:17,941 --> 01:49:23,857
You're not suggesting that l
back off a materiai witness?

1041
01:49:24,021 --> 01:49:27,013
If you can't get him ... yeah.

1042
01:49:29,181 --> 01:49:33,572
AII rise!

1043
01:49:35,421 --> 01:49:38,254
- Where's Sam?
- On his way.

1044
01:49:43,741 --> 01:49:47,654
- Where is he?
- Don't worry.

1045
01:49:47,821 --> 01:49:52,178
Lieutenant! CalI your witness.

1046
01:49:56,541 --> 01:50:01,012
Defence calIs Colonel Nathan Jessep.

1047
01:50:15,261 --> 01:50:17,980
Raise your right hand, please.

1048
01:50:18,141 --> 01:50:24,660
WiII you teIl the truth, the whoIe
truth, and nothing but the truth?

1049
01:50:24,821 --> 01:50:29,053
- Yes.
- Have a seat pIease, sir.

1050
01:50:29,221 --> 01:50:32,418
State your name,
rank and current biIlet.

1051
01:50:32,981 --> 01:50:38,578
Colonel Jessep, Commanding Officer,
Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

1052
01:50:39,821 --> 01:50:43,257
He's not here.

1053
01:50:46,581 --> 01:50:50,130
When you Iearned
of Santiago's Ietter, -

1054
01:50:50,301 --> 01:50:55,773
- you had a meeting
with your senior officers, correct?

1055
01:50:55,941 --> 01:51:03,814
PIatoon Commander Kendrick,
and Lt. CoIoneI Markinson.

1056
01:51:03,981 --> 01:51:08,179
And Markinson is now dead,
is that right?

1057
01:51:08,341 --> 01:51:15,531
- What is the counseIlor impIying?
- Just that Markinson is not aIive.

1058
01:51:15,701 --> 01:51:19,091
The coIoneI
doesn't need to confirm that.

1059
01:51:19,261 --> 01:51:24,415
He may not be aware that Markinson
took his own Iife two days ago.

1060
01:51:24,581 --> 01:51:28,699
The witness, the court
and now the jury are aware.

1061
01:51:28,861 --> 01:51:33,810
We thank you.
Move on, Lieutenant.

1062
01:51:35,901 --> 01:51:39,177
You gave Kendrick an order, right?

1063
01:51:39,341 --> 01:51:43,380
I toId him to teII his men
not to touch Santiago.

1064
01:51:43,541 --> 01:51:46,294
Did you give Markinson an order?

1065
01:51:46,461 --> 01:51:51,740
l ordered him to have Santiago
transferred immediately.

1066
01:51:51,901 --> 01:51:57,134
- Why?
- His Iife might be in danger.

1067
01:51:57,301 --> 01:52:01,692
- Grave danger?
- Is there another kind?

1068
01:52:04,261 --> 01:52:08,174
This is the order
that you and Markinson signed -

1069
01:52:08,341 --> 01:52:12,459
- for Santiago to fIy out
at six the next morning.

1070
01:52:12,621 --> 01:52:17,456
- Was that the first fIight?
- Yes, it was.

1071
01:52:21,261 --> 01:52:24,492
You fIew here today, didn"t you?

1072
01:52:24,661 --> 01:52:29,291
- You're wearing your dress uniform.
- As are you.

1073
01:52:29,461 --> 01:52:33,659
- Did you wear it on the pIane?
- ls this reIevant?

1074
01:52:33,821 --> 01:52:37,939
I'm asking the court
for a IittIe Iatitude.

1075
01:52:38,101 --> 01:52:42,014
A very IittIe Iatitude.

1076
01:52:42,181 --> 01:52:47,016
- I wore utilities on the pIane.
- You brought the uniform?

1077
01:52:47,181 --> 01:52:52,619
Toothbrush, shaving kit, underwear?
Is his underwear a state secret?

1078
01:52:52,781 --> 01:52:58,060
You'd better get somewhere fast
with this, Lieutenant!

1079
01:52:58,621 --> 01:53:04,730
I brought a change of cIothes
and some personaI items.

1080
01:53:04,901 --> 01:53:12,296
After Dawson and Downey's arrest,
Santiago's room was inventoried.

1081
01:53:12,461 --> 01:53:17,057
Four pairs of camoufIage pants,
three khaki shirts, boots.

1082
01:53:17,221 --> 01:53:22,215
- Four pairs of socks ...
- Is there any question coming?

1083
01:53:22,381 --> 01:53:27,978
- Lieutenant, state your question.
- Why hadn't Santiago packed?

1084
01:53:30,461 --> 01:53:37,253
We'Il get back to that. This is a
record of phone calls from the base.

1085
01:53:37,421 --> 01:53:43,053
You've recently made three caIls.
Do you recognise the numbers?

1086
01:53:43,221 --> 01:53:48,739
l caIled CoIoneI Fitzhughes
to teII him I'd be in town.

1087
01:53:48,901 --> 01:53:54,533
The second was to arrange a
meeting with Congressman Richman.

1088
01:53:54,701 --> 01:53:59,650
- And the third was to my sister.
- Why did you caII her?

1089
01:53:59,821 --> 01:54:04,178
I invited her to dinner tonight.

1090
01:54:04,341 --> 01:54:08,254
These are the records
for September 6th.

1091
01:54:08,421 --> 01:54:13,176
And these are the 14 Ietters
Santiago wrote in nine months, -

1092
01:54:13,341 --> 01:54:16,458
- begging for a transfer.

1093
01:54:16,621 --> 01:54:21,172
But when he finaIIy got it, -

1094
01:54:21,341 --> 01:54:25,653
- how many peopIe did he caII?
Zero! Nobody.

1095
01:54:25,821 --> 01:54:32,613
Not one caII to his parents or
a friend, saying he was coming.

1096
01:54:32,781 --> 01:54:38,777
He was asIeep at midnight, and you
say he had a fIight in six hours.

1097
01:54:38,941 --> 01:54:45,096
Yet everything he owned was
in his cIoset or his footIocker.

1098
01:54:45,261 --> 01:54:48,617
For one day, you packed
and made three caIIs.

1099
01:54:48,781 --> 01:54:54,458
Santiago was Ieaving
for the rest of his life.

1100
01:54:54,621 --> 01:54:59,854
And he hadn't called a soul,
or packed a thing.

1101
01:55:02,981 --> 01:55:06,940
Can you expIain that?

1102
01:55:07,101 --> 01:55:12,016
There was no transfer order,
was there?

1103
01:55:12,181 --> 01:55:17,539
Objection! Lt. Kaffee is trying to
smear a high-ranking officer -

1104
01:55:17,701 --> 01:55:21,933
- hoping to suggest impropriety
and win points.

1105
01:55:22,101 --> 01:55:29,018
I recommend that he be reprimanded,
and the witness be excused.

1106
01:55:29,181 --> 01:55:35,336
- Overruled. The objection is noted.
- ColoneI?

1107
01:55:39,261 --> 01:55:43,698
- Is this funny, sir?
- No, it's tragic.

1108
01:55:43,861 --> 01:55:50,255
- Do you have an answer?
- AbsoIuteIy. I don"t have a cIue.

1109
01:55:50,421 --> 01:55:56,496
Maybe he was an earIy riser.
Maybe he didn't have any friends.

1110
01:55:56,661 --> 01:56:03,737
I'm an educated man, but I don't
know the traveI habits of Santiago.

1111
01:56:03,901 --> 01:56:09,419
What l do know is that he was
set to Ieave at 0600.

1112
01:56:09,581 --> 01:56:16,612
Are these reaIly the questions
I was caIIed here to answer?

1113
01:56:16,781 --> 01:56:20,217
I hope you have something more.

1114
01:56:20,381 --> 01:56:24,056
These two marines
are on trial for their Iives.

1115
01:56:24,221 --> 01:56:30,490
Please teIl me their Iawyer hasn't
pinned their hopes to a phone biII.

1116
01:56:30,661 --> 01:56:36,293
Do you have any other
questions for me, counseIIor?

1117
01:56:42,461 --> 01:56:44,975
Lieutenant Kaffee?

1118
01:56:51,701 --> 01:56:56,775
Lieutenant, do you have anything
further for this witness?

1119
01:57:02,381 --> 01:57:07,171
- Thanks, Danny. I Iove Washington.
- I didn't dismiss you.

1120
01:57:07,341 --> 01:57:14,258
- I beg your pardon?
- I'm not through. Sit down.

1121
01:57:16,061 --> 01:57:18,734
''CoIoneI.''

1122
01:57:18,901 --> 01:57:22,860
He shouId address me as
''CoIonel'' or ''sir'".

1123
01:57:23,021 --> 01:57:29,893
- CaII him ''CoIoneI'' or ''sir''.
- What kind of unit is this?

1124
01:57:30,061 --> 01:57:35,374
And the witness will address me
as ''judge'' or ''Your Honour''.

1125
01:57:35,541 --> 01:57:39,659
Take your seat ... CoIonel.

1126
01:57:42,701 --> 01:57:46,899
What shaIl we discuss?
My favourite colour?

1127
01:57:47,661 --> 01:57:51,859
CoIoneI, the 6.00 a.m. fIight
was the first one?

1128
01:57:52,021 --> 01:57:56,173
There wasn't one seven hours earIier
to Andrews?

1129
01:57:56,341 --> 01:57:59,094
Haven't we covered this?

1130
01:57:59,661 --> 01:58:04,974
These are the fIight Iogs for
Guantanamo Bay and Andrews.

1131
01:58:05,141 --> 01:58:10,773
There's no flight at 1 1 .00 p.m.,
and no arrivaI at 2.00 a.m.

1132
01:58:10,941 --> 01:58:13,375
l'd Iike to admit them as evidence.

1133
01:58:13,941 --> 01:58:20,289
- But the fIight never existed!
- We beIieve it did, sir.

1134
01:58:20,461 --> 01:58:26,172
We caIl Airmen O'MaIIey and
Rodriguez of Andrews Air Base.

1135
01:58:26,341 --> 01:58:33,213
- They're not on the Iist.
- They are rebuttaI witnesses.

1136
01:58:33,381 --> 01:58:37,659
- I'II alIow the witnesses.
- This is ridicuIous!

1137
01:58:37,821 --> 01:58:43,339
- Check the Iogs, for Christ's sake!
- We'Il get to that in a minute.

1138
01:58:43,501 --> 01:58:51,693
You said, you told Kendrick to say
that Santiago wasn't to be touched.

1139
01:58:51,861 --> 01:58:56,173
- He was cIear on what you wanted?
- CrystaI.

1140
01:58:56,941 --> 01:59:01,378
- Can he have ignored the order?
- lgnored the order?

1141
01:59:01,541 --> 01:59:04,260
- Or forgot it?
- No.

1142
01:59:04,421 --> 01:59:10,178
CouId he have thought,
''The oId man is wrong''?

1143
01:59:10,341 --> 01:59:15,574
When Lt. Kendrick talked to the men,
any chance they ignored him?

1144
01:59:16,981 --> 01:59:20,940
Ever been in the infantry, son?

1145
01:59:21,101 --> 01:59:24,332
Ever served in a forward area?

1146
01:59:24,501 --> 01:59:31,054
Ever put your Iife in another
man's hands, and his in yours?

1147
01:59:31,221 --> 01:59:36,056
We folIow orders, son.
Otherwise peopIe die.

1148
01:59:36,221 --> 01:59:40,897
lt's that simpIe. Are we cIear?

1149
01:59:41,061 --> 01:59:46,010
- Are we cIear?
- CrystaI.

1150
01:59:46,781 --> 01:59:52,060
One last question, before I caIl
Airmen O'MaIIey and Rodriguez.

1151
01:59:52,221 --> 01:59:56,339
If you ordered that Santiago wasn't
to be touched, -

1152
01:59:56,501 --> 02:00:00,699
- and your orders
are aIways foIIowed, -

1153
02:00:00,861 --> 02:00:05,412
- then why was Santiago in danger?

1154
02:00:05,581 --> 02:00:11,531
Why wouId it be necessary
to transfer him off the base?

1155
02:00:14,381 --> 02:00:18,772
He was a sub-standard marine.
He was being transferred ...

1156
02:00:18,941 --> 02:00:23,537
You said he was transferred
because he was in danger.

1157
02:00:23,701 --> 02:00:28,729
I said, ''grave danger?'' and you
said ... we can read it ...

1158
02:00:28,901 --> 02:00:35,295
- I know what I said!
- Then why the two orders?

1159
02:00:37,021 --> 02:00:42,732
- Men can do things on their own.
- But your men never did.

1160
02:00:42,901 --> 02:00:47,258
Your men obey orders.
So Santiago wasn't in danger, right?

1161
02:00:47,421 --> 02:00:49,776
You snotty littIe bastard.

1162
02:00:49,941 --> 02:00:54,492
- I request a recess.
- We'II wait for an answer.

1163
02:00:55,141 --> 02:01:00,693
If Lt. Kendrick gave an order that
Santiago wasn't to be touched, -

1164
02:01:00,861 --> 02:01:05,093
- why did he have to be transferred?

1165
02:01:05,261 --> 02:01:09,732
Kendrick ordered a Code Red,
because you toId him to!

1166
02:01:09,901 --> 02:01:16,056
And when it went bad, you signed a
phoney transfer and fixed the logs!

1167
02:01:16,221 --> 02:01:21,249
You coerced the doctor! CoIonel
Jessep, did you order the Code Red?

1168
02:01:21,421 --> 02:01:25,892
- You don't have to answer that.
- You want answers?

1169
02:01:26,061 --> 02:01:29,053
l want the truth!

1170
02:01:29,221 --> 02:01:32,338
You can't handIe the truth!

1171
02:01:32,501 --> 02:01:36,779
Son, we Iive in a worId with
waIIs that must be guarded.

1172
02:01:36,941 --> 02:01:41,298
Who's gonna do it? You?
You, Lt. Weinberg?

1173
02:01:41,461 --> 02:01:44,931
i have more responsibiIity
than you can fathom.

1174
02:01:45,101 --> 02:01:48,298
You weep for Santiago
and curse the Marines.

1175
02:01:48,461 --> 02:01:55,970
You don't know what I know.
Santiago's tragic death saved Iives.

1176
02:01:56,141 --> 02:02:01,773
And my existence,
whiIe grotesque to you, saves Iives!

1177
02:02:01,941 --> 02:02:06,492
But deep down, in pIaces
you don't taIk about at parties, -

1178
02:02:06,661 --> 02:02:10,939
- you need me on that walI.

1179
02:02:11,101 --> 02:02:15,253
We use words Iike
honour, code, Ioyalty.

1180
02:02:15,421 --> 02:02:20,779
They're the backbone of our Iives.
You use them as a punchIine!

1181
02:02:20,941 --> 02:02:24,490
I haven't the time or incIination
to expIain myseIf -

1182
02:02:24,661 --> 02:02:28,700
- to a man who needs my protection -

1183
02:02:28,861 --> 02:02:34,538
- but questions the way I do it.
Better just to thank me.

1184
02:02:34,701 --> 02:02:38,250
Or pick up a gun and stand a post.

1185
02:02:38,421 --> 02:02:43,017
But I don't give a damn
what you think you are entitIed to!

1186
02:02:43,181 --> 02:02:48,938
- Did you order the Code Red?
- You're goddamn right I did!

1187
02:02:59,421 --> 02:03:05,656
I suggest the jury be dismissed, and
we move to an article 39a session.

1188
02:03:05,821 --> 02:03:10,212
- The witness has rights.
- Captain Ross?

1189
02:03:14,821 --> 02:03:18,973
Jack?

1190
02:03:21,021 --> 02:03:24,218
The members of the court
wiII retire.

1191
02:03:27,341 --> 02:03:33,132
What the heII is this?
l did my job, I'd do it again.

1192
02:03:33,301 --> 02:03:37,931
- I'm going back to my base.
- You're not going anywhere.

1193
02:03:38,101 --> 02:03:42,174
MP's, guard the coIoneI!

1194
02:03:43,221 --> 02:03:48,773
- Captain Ross.
- You've the right to remain siIent.

1195
02:03:48,941 --> 02:03:52,854
I'm being charged with a crime?

1196
02:03:53,021 --> 02:03:56,138
l'm being charged with a crime?

1197
02:03:56,301 --> 02:04:00,180
This is funny, that's what this is!

1198
02:04:00,341 --> 02:04:05,495
I'm gonna rip the eyes out of your
head and piss in your skuII!

1199
02:04:05,661 --> 02:04:10,371
CoIoneI Jessep,
do you understand your rights?

1200
02:04:14,701 --> 02:04:20,094
You fucking people have no
idea how to defend a nation.

1201
02:04:20,261 --> 02:04:25,494
AII you did was weaken a country,
Kaffee!

1202
02:04:25,661 --> 02:04:30,291
You put peopIes' Iives in danger.
Sweet dreams, son.

1203
02:04:30,461 --> 02:04:36,696
Don't caII me son.
I'm a Iawyer, and a navaI officer.

1204
02:04:36,861 --> 02:04:41,935
And you're under arrest,
you son of a bitch!

1205
02:04:43,661 --> 02:04:47,654
The witness is excused.

1206
02:05:06,901 --> 02:05:10,211
AlI rise!

1207
02:05:18,981 --> 02:05:23,497
- Have you reached a verdict?
- We have, sir.

1208
02:05:33,781 --> 02:05:39,094
Corporal Dawson
and Private Downey.

1209
02:05:39,741 --> 02:05:44,292
Of the charge of murder,
the members find the accused -

1210
02:05:44,461 --> 02:05:47,180
- not guiIty.

1211
02:05:47,341 --> 02:05:51,050
On the charge of
conspiracy to commit murder, -

1212
02:05:51,221 --> 02:05:56,932
- the members
find the accused not guiIty.

1213
02:05:57,101 --> 02:06:01,060
On the charge of
conduct unbecoming a US Marine, -

1214
02:06:01,221 --> 02:06:06,898
- the members
find the accused guilty as charged.

1215
02:06:08,221 --> 02:06:11,258
You are sentenced to
time aIready served, -

1216
02:06:11,421 --> 02:06:15,937
- and to be dishonourabIy
discharged from the Marines.

1217
02:06:17,301 --> 02:06:21,340
This court-martiaI is adjourned.

1218
02:06:36,301 --> 02:06:40,260
What did that mean?

1219
02:06:40,421 --> 02:06:43,140
Hal?

1220
02:06:43,301 --> 02:06:47,180
What did that mean?

1221
02:06:48,261 --> 02:06:53,096
CoIoneI Jessep said
he ordered the Code Red.

1222
02:06:53,261 --> 02:06:57,334
- What did we do wrong?
- It's not that simpIe.

1223
02:06:57,501 --> 02:07:02,177
- We did nothing wrong!
- Yeah, we did.

1224
02:07:04,061 --> 02:07:08,771
We're supposed to fight for peopIe
who can't fight for themseIves.

1225
02:07:08,941 --> 02:07:13,571
We were supposed to fight for WilIy.

1226
02:07:17,581 --> 02:07:23,258
Lt. Kaffee, I have to
take these men for some paperwork.

1227
02:07:31,861 --> 02:07:34,694
HaroId?

1228
02:07:36,741 --> 02:07:39,460
Sir?

1229
02:07:39,621 --> 02:07:45,457
You don't need a patch on your arm
to have honour.

1230
02:07:45,621 --> 02:07:51,332
Ten-hut! There's an officer on deck.

1231
02:08:14,181 --> 02:08:19,301
O'MaIley and Rodriguez,
what exactIy couId they testify to?

1232
02:08:19,461 --> 02:08:24,376
Probably that they had absoIuteIy
no recoIIection of anything.

1233
02:08:24,541 --> 02:08:29,171
- Strong witnesses.
- And handsome too.

1234
02:08:29,341 --> 02:08:34,290
- I've got to go arrest Kendrick.
- TelI him I said ''Hi''.

1235
02:08:34,461 --> 02:08:38,374
WiII do.

1236
02:12:18,421 --> 02:12:22,494
