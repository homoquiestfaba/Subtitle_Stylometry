00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:09,100
>>> The Spy Next Door <<<

2
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,100
Mama! He eats car on my dolls.

3
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:03,200
Pig, cautiously.

4
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:07,400
There is no evidence
for its accusations.

5
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,900
Gillian, your son is crazy.
He kicked my booby hairdryer.

6
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,400
Nice assumption
but you can not prove.

7
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:17,300
No, but I can hurt you.
- Mama.

8
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,500
They need medical care.

9
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,500
Come on.
- Come here.

10
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:25,700
I hate this family.
Come here.

11
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:30,000
You get punishment now!

12
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,900
Come on, guys.

13
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,400
Backpack.

14
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,800
It is in fashion.
- Inappropriate.

15
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:53,300
Put a jeans.

16
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,700
And the gum away.

17
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:00,100
What color do you wear today?

18
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:05,700
Red, blue, purple...?
- Pink.

19
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,600
Farren.
- You said jeans.

20
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:13,200
I meant in your size.

21
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:17,200
Come on, guys.
Otherwise we'll be late.

22
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,800
Please.

23
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,200
Come on, baby.

24
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:30,200
No, look.

25
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,400
Not fighting.

26
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,100
Let me.
- Hi.

27
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,800
Are we still dinner?
- I'll be there.

28
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,900
There is public.

29
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I surrender.
- He is such a loser.

30
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:59,400
I may like Bob, he is nice.
- It is a dull pen importer.

31
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,300
Every day the same routine.
Like a robot.

32
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,300
That is he. A cyborg.

33
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:09,300
In the future it destroys humanity.
Starting with us.

34
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:16,800
Already three months.
Happy anniversary.

35
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,600
What is it?

36
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,300
I tell you about my job.

37
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,700
This may surprise you...

38
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:37,700
but you know everything
Before this relationship developed.

39
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,000
Do not, Bob.
- Why?

40
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:47,500
I am very happy with you.
Nobody let me laugh so.

41
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:50,700
And if I was single,
I saw a future in our...

42
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,200
but I come in one package.

43
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:55,000
What do you mean?

44
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:59,600
My kids are my priority...
How do I say this kindly...

45
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,600
They hate me.
- Yes.

46
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:05,800
I make them like me.

47
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:09,600
That just can not.
Not mine, or whose well.

48
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:13,200
They have endured much and...

49
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:17,700
We can best do not go
you until they are accustomed.

50
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,200
Does not your happiness?

51
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,300
Excuse me.

52
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,400
Sorry, I must go.
Emergency on 't work.

53
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:34,600
No ink?
- Much bigger.

54
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:38,200
Really sorry I explain everything tomorrow.

55
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:41,800
Well, see you tomorrow.

56
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,000
Why did you take so long?
- Six minutes.

57
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:05,600
Stopped for a late?
- I get it, what is the expression...

58
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,800
bust my heels.
- Something.

59
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:11,500
Poldark and a few other
went just inside the refinery.

60
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,700
I was right.

61
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:18,400
She plans thing.
Maybe they want to get free gasoline.

62
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:21,800
No, that is as a villain. That may
eat nails with a corkscrew.

63
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:24,300
Gilbrough is the main authority
at Poldark. What is he up to?

64
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,200
If his mission to sabotage
the world's oil reserves...

65
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:30,400
Why he served for
as a small refiner?

66
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:34,200
I make sure that you can ask him.

67
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:50,600
How do you get about?
With a jetpack?

68
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:53,300
We take the 'shark'.

69
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:10,600
Wait for my sign.

70
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:20,400
Yuri.

71
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,500
What is this?
- C4.

72
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:26,400
When we finished, I
that brings down everything.

73
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:07,100
Quickly, I have not got all day.
There is no pressure.

74
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:31,000
Bob Ho.

75
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:46,500
I would like to catch up,
but I must go.

76
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,900
Forward.

77
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,900
Stay where you are.

78
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
That was fun.
- Great aerobics.

79
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:43,800
We must do this again.
- Poldark, we go.

80
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,000
You had Poldark his face.

81
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,200
Good job, Bob. Unbelievable.

82
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,900
I do not like to see you leave,
you're the best agent ever.

83
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,600
Hey, count me out.

84
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:05,500
Maybe I can make
government that you lend your little longer.

85
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,500
No, this was my last assignment.

86
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:12,000
I retire.
- Still not Gillian?

87
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:15,800
I want to live. Wedding.

88
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:21,400
Not married. Take a woman you
over five years hate and give her your house.

89
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:26,800
Keep watch it.
To compliment the CIA.

90
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,900
Gillian, who is that woman
cover your next home lives?

91
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,700
Yes, they are already as this.
- I never give this life for a woman.

92
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,400
We are spies.
Every boy wants a spy.

93
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:39,900
It is life. All the hours
you spend in such a small room like this.

94
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,900
Cold food in a surveillance van.
It is all the time on your shot.

95
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,600
Learning to pee in a bottle
in a moving car.

96
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:51,200
You do it right.
- Any problem, her children hate me.

97
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:56,500
You rule.
- We miss you, success with the children.

98
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:01,500
I've shot down dictators,
how difficult three children?

99
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:05,800
Come on, Ringo. Get down.

100
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:13,000
Hi, kids.

101
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,400
Sorry about last night.

102
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:21,800
Never mind, that's your job.
- No, it was rude.

103
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:24,800
It never happens again, promised.

104
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:27,800
Mama, what with Ringo?

105
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,800
He'll come down
when he finished.

106
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,900
Want to see I'm working?
- Of course.

107
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,900
Come on, kitty.
It is not as high.

108
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,500
Please?

109
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:55,800
Please.

110
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,400
What do you think?

111
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:17,200
It remains to be finished.
But today I could not do anything...

112
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:22,600
the cat on the roof, satellite breaks down again.
I phoned two hours for a repairman.

113
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:25,700
And I always think of yesterday.

114
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:28,300
So...

115
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,700
so good between us?

116
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:35,400
I understand it, as a man with your
marries, he marries you all four.

117
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:39,800
Forget the pig,
the cat and the turtle does not.

118
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:45,900
Do you really nicely?
- Frightening.

119
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:50,800
You are truly the last honest
man in the world, I sometimes think.

120
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:03,300
I have cookies.

121
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,500
Yes?
- Are you really married to Bob?

122
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:11,100
What? Calm down.
- You can not do, Gillian.

123
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:15,500
You're so much above him.
- He is boring and a nerd.

124
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,400
He is a very sweet man
who treats me very well.

125
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:22,600
He is a pen importer.
- He is a cyborg.

126
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:27,900
You know him like me.
He is very enthusiastic about the world...

127
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,500
and my art. He likes to talk
history, science...

128
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:35,800
and politics.
- So it is boring.

129
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:41,700
You call it boring,
I call it reliable.

130
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:45,200
I also want a man who
every day to work.

131
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:49,700
And who comes home every night.
Not lying or deceiving...

132
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:53,000
or who leaves his family and...

133
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:05,500
My luck also counts.

134
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:10,600
Old people as hateful feelings.

135
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:14,800
We need to see Bob working away.

136
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:31,000
What is the story here?
- Poldark was transported.

137
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:35,600
He's not escaped?
- He is so taken as can be.

138
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:39,000
This was one planned.
She knew that he came.

139
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:44,200
Say you have a mole is?
- No, only that he escaped.

140
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:05,500
Welcome back.

141
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:17,400
Get Chad.

142
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,800
You can not imagine what it is...

143
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:24,900
the oppressive darkness and
agonizing torture and endless torment.

144
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,300
The prison is a hell.
- You were there four hours.

145
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,900
More than enough.

146
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:36,700
I need a new path
of the formula. As soon as possible.

147
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:40,700
In two days we test again.

148
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:45,900
I have to get dressed.
Something contemporary and fashionable.

149
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,600
And something to eat
that is not a toy.

150
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,900
Yes.

151
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,100
Honey, we make the finished pumpkins.
Are you?

152
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:55,000
Absolutely, because I'm a loser
and have no life.

153
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:59,300
Did I mention that we
to roast the pumpkin seeds?

154
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:02,900
Come on, Join us.

155
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,300
And what I want private.
- Do not be with me.

156
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,100
I do when I want.
- Farren.

157
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,900
I want you down...
- I do not. Way.

158
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,500
This is my house...
- You hold me!

159
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,600
I said outside, Gillian.

160
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:21,200
Downstairs, in five minutes.
- I hate this house and family. Way!

161
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:36,600
No, she hears me.
I sit on the roof.

162
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:40,400
The only place where I is private.

163
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,500
I can not Gillian
that guy to marry.

164
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:48,600
No, he is indeed a hen,
but that is not the problem.

165
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:52,100
What if my dad comes back?

166
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:55,300
He lets me not only here,
he comes back.

167
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:58,300
And what if they married?

168
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,200
No idea.

169
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:10,800
Mama, Ian Devan gives bacon.

170
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:13,800
That is wrong.
- Why?

171
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:30,300
Bob Ho.
- Hi.

172
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,800
And how are the kids?
- I go picnicking with them.

173
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:36,400
I force them to like me.
- Hen force?

174
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:39,800
You may as well scratch your ear
with your elbow.

175
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,400
Guess. Poldark escaped.

176
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:49,600
Not my problem.
- I know.

177
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:53,500
But we have discovered a document.
An international portal to a website.

178
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:57,100
We have not cracked.
Maybe you see it.

179
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:01,200
Failing that, great.
If not, nothing wrong.

180
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:05,400
For you. Send it to my computer at home.

181
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:08,900
Already happened. Now I think of...

182
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,100
they think there is a mole in the agency.

183
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,400
They suspect me?
- No...

184
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:17,900
you're the sharpest hook on the wire.

185
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,100
No idea what you say.

186
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:25,200
Enjoy your picnic.
Call me when you look at that file.

187
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:27,900
Thank you.

188
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:47,600
I saw codes. Let's see.

189
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:03,900
Is it noon already?
- No, bad news.

190
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:09,400
My father lies in a hospital.
- That is terrible.

191
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,800
He played softball and slipped.
Now, his hip replaced.

192
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:18,100
Terrible. - I have children
leave to care for father.

193
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:22,400
Great.
- What?

194
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:26,200
Let me look at them.
We learn to know each other.

195
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:29,800
No, you and them?

196
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,500
I do not know.

197
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,500
My aunt flies over San Antonio.
She is very good with children.

198
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:38,400
She was in the army.
- This is perhaps what we need.

199
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,900
Can you really that busy?

200
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Driving, homework, halloween.
Their costume complete.

201
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,800
Decorate the house.
- No problem.

202
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:53,400
Halloween is my favorite.
They are perfectly safe with me.

203
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:56,800
About them, I am not worried.

204
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,100
That you kidding?
- Are there any other options?

205
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,000
Foster care, juvenile detention?

206
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:09,600
I love you.

207
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,800
I miss you.
- Yeah, so let us support you.

208
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:17,300
You survive it.
I buy something.

209
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:20,900
Bye! We love you.

210
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,100
Is not this great?

211
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:35,700
I get some things in
and we go to your home.

212
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,100
His computer. Let's see.
- Good idea.

213
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:46,600
There should be standing up dirt.

214
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,600
Fashion, Armageddon.

215
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:54,800
I do not remember.
I still see the file.

216
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:57,100
But this is important...

217
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,400
What is Halloween?

218
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:04,400
Do you realize what this is?

219
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:08,200
You excited? Fixed a
dictionary.

220
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:11,000
You confuse me with a very
different class of nerd.

221
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:14,500
Stockholm GBH.
Davis Bodily Harm.

222
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:19,200
Live in Stockholm. One of the
rarest concerts.

223
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:21,700
Why did Bob die?
- What does it matter?

224
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:24,200
I get it off.

225
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:28,500
This is my ticket to coolness.

226
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:39,200
This should I wear?

227
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:43,900
You wanted something contemporary.
- Just the First Prince of Belarus.

228
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:47,200
Let someone get elegants.

229
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:49,600
What is the problem?

230
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:54,900
I wanted to pick up the formula
and noticed that someone else had access.

231
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,000
If China has the formula,
they can develop the antimatter.

232
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:01,500
I urge the Ip address.
But it is really encrypted.

233
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,400
It takes a while.

234
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:07,700
Find out who my formula
picked and get it back.

235
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:11,700
And...?
- Kill them.

236
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:14,200
Thank you.

237
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,400
What is wrong with you?
- I kill you.

238
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,700
What? I you.

239
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:28,000
Do not hurt me!
She makes me hurt.

240
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:33,700
Stop, what's going on?

241
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:37,100
She threw a stink bomb in my room.
- Really not true.

242
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,500
So I threw in my own room?

243
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:43,300
To give you problems?
Pathetic.

244
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,200
So sad.

245
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:49,300
Farren, I am very disappointed.

246
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,500
You should be resting.

247
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:56,600
If we have homework on time,
we may stay up to twelve hours.

248
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:02,000
She also wants us adult films.
A tradition.

249
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:06,000
Here I have not thought about.

250
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:18,100
Nora, time for bed.

251
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,800
I would not go to sleep!

252
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:28,000
You can never catch.

253
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,800
Coming!

254
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:37,800
Come back.

255
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,400
Come back.

256
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:47,200
I got you. Come back.

257
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,100
Come on.

258
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:00,300
Mama is just my clothes!

259
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:04,000
Mama always dresses me.

260
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,400
Is that your mom?

261
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:15,500
Now sleep.

262
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:42,500
Out!

263
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:49,700
Hello?
- You're alive.

264
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:52,700
That 's a good sign.
How are the kids?

265
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:55,800
A great night.
So simple.

266
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:59,200
Really? You and my kids, right?

267
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:05,700
Bob, last thing you wanted
about your job...

268
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:09,600
but I interrupted you.
Would you tell me?

269
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:13,600
That can wait until you get back.

270
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:17,300
This was really a good idea, I think.

271
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:20,800
The worst is definitely behind us.

272
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:41,000
Please wait.

273
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:02,200
I al

274
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:05,500
Fire!

275
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:13,300
Mistake.

276
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:21,400
Everything is good.
Almost done.

277
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,800
I sit in front.
- It is not your day.

278
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:31,100
Can you really go to school
Your mother?

279
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,300
Of course, Bob.

280
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:36,000
"Sure, Bob.

281
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:49,400
Bye.
- Have a nice day.

282
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:03,000
What do you do every day?
- Nothing, I'm lazy.

283
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:11,100
You're lying.
- Yeah, you're lying.

284
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,500
I picked up yesterday.

285
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:17,100
Really? Would have been pretty cool.
- Yeah, pretty cool.

286
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,500
Let's hear it then.

287
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:26,100
That's just a lot of noise.

288
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:29,700
I do not get it.
- I do. You're pathetic and a liar.

289
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:32,700
We get him.

290
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:36,200
Put me down!

291
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:39,100
Put me down.
- Okay, you asked for it.

292
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,300
You have heard of me,
through a lawyer.

293
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:48,900
Here do I pay for you all.

294
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:59,700
Tell me more about Halloween.

295
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:05,000
That's great. You get sweets,
you're dressed as someone else.

296
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,400
And nobody knows who you are.

297
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:10,500
That sounds familiar.

298
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:14,600
What would you be? Frankenstein?

299
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:20,100
A Zombie?
- Honey, would you a princess?

300
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:29,100
Well, princess.

301
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:41,600
No fee. A princess.

302
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:45,100
Princess.

303
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:52,500
Pink.
- Pink.

304
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:13,800
Princess.
- It is too big.

305
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:16,600
Too big?

306
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:02,800
Sorry.

307
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:35,100
You do not walk away.
- I'm sorry.

308
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:38,500
Let your costume going to pay.

309
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:45,500
With Ho.

310
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:49,200
Hold him until I get there.

311
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:58,800
May I say before we begin
only the current condition of the...

312
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,400
American Public School System
I filed is...

313
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:08,100
head first, into a bin and I get
then a penalty.

314
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:12,500
Who are you exactly?

315
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:16,100
I am his mother...

316
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,600
neighbor.
- Buurman.

317
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:20,400
I watch him a few days.

318
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:22,600
This is not the first time Ian
in trouble.

319
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:25,400
He lost in battle. He is lying.
- I'm not lying.

320
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:30,000
You've told everyone you Celina Gomez
have been invited to the spring dance.

321
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:32,200
Her coming to the USA was a problem.

322
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:34,600
You said that your New Year's Eve
have spent at the Playboy Mansion?

323
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:37,400
"Pay per vieuw. It felt like I was there.

324
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:46,700
I tell you, lying is a dangerous game.

325
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:50,300
You sell pens. What...
Oh, no.

326
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:52,000
They are.
- Who?

327
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:54,100
These criminals have future
I put in the trash.

328
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:58,900
We have received punishment by you.
- Yes, by you.

329
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,400
There you go for pay.
- Gentlemen, we want no trouble.

330
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:05,700
Who is that. Your mother?
- My bodyguard.

331
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:09,000
I hired him.
Better watch out.

332
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:11,600
Is that true?
- No, he makes a joke.

333
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:14,700
I'm the babysitter.
- What are you doing?

334
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:18,200
You ask politely if we can through.

335
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:32,700
You are humiliating.
Why did not you?

336
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:36,300
Why did you I was your bodyguard?

337
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:40,400
I think it was too much stress.

338
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:57,100
How are you? I'm Ian.
You have a beautiful body.

339
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:00,500
Can I hold it against me?

340
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:03,100
At least you're not shy.

341
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:06,300
I wanted in the worst way
talk to her.

342
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:09,500
Mission accomplished.

343
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:16,800
Come here.
You look so beautiful.

344
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:23,500
I did not know you did gymnastics.
- Why?

345
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,400
You know nothing about me.

346
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:29,100
You go and you talk Gillian
Never us.

347
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:32,100
Come on.

348
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:35,500
The woman has a point.

349
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:44,100
I do not know who you are to send out
my clothes.

350
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:46,800
I want them killed.

351
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:51,500
You could even go.
- I'm the most wanted man in America.

352
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,000
I can not stretch the
JCPenney to sniff.

353
00:34:56,100 --> 00:35:00,100
Give me something that I can mix.
Something extremely American.

354
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:03,600
We are ready to test.

355
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:32,900
Beautiful.

356
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:44,800
She certainly has its plastic shoes.
It eats any petroleum product.

357
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:51,000
We are working on.

358
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:58,000
What happened to the bacteria?
- They live as long as they are fed.

359
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:02,800
If that path, then disappear.
- Just like my Jimmy Choo's.

360
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:13,000
Come inside.

361
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:20,300
About today...
- You had me to come.

362
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:23,200
I have to face come.
- Do it.

363
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:27,200
Unless you the rest of your life with your head
in the trash will spend.

364
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:31,500
Thanks for the advice.
All my problems are solved.

365
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:43,700
Do you get it in the lower?
- No, I read for pleasure.

366
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:49,300
You're smart.

367
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:52,200
It you're not so bad.
Why ruin everything?

368
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:55,400
Girls are not really impressed
of astro physical.

369
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:59,500
According to the sources I can design a rocket
build and launch a...

370
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:02,700
really in orbit around the moon would go.

371
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:06,800
But that can not other guys.

372
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:09,500
They throw balls through a ring.

373
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,900
I do not want you any problems.

374
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:16,900
If you now try the truth
to tell...

375
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,300
tell your mom anything
about your date.

376
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:22,400
Really. That was almost cool.

377
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:26,200
For a guy who sells pens?

378
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:33,700
Come on, kids.
Bedtime.

379
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:37,700
Come on. Even a spoon.

380
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:24,000
Just one. That I learned in China
when I was young.

381
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:11,300
I agree.
I need your help.

382
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:25,300
I have a lot of fuss to make
to get all this stuff.

383
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:28,300
What did you say them?
- If I do not know what weapons...

384
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:31,500
Don, I get problems.

385
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:34,700
Where did you get this all for?
- In order to get kids ready for school.

386
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,600
As my mother always said,
when they were in East Berlin Sat...

387
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:43,700
spying is easy, parents are
is difficult. Good luck.

388
00:39:57,300 --> 00:40:00,700
But come on.

389
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:04,700
You're there all morning.
Let me in there.

390
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:10,100
Farren, let me in there.

391
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:17,000
You're there all morning.
Let me in there.

392
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:22,900
Now it's my turn.

393
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:27,700
Farren, Daughter
a longer skirt.

394
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:34,200
This means war.

395
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:08,600
Stay with Bob.

396
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,900
Where is he?
- He is hiding.

397
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,400
He lets us fall into the trap,
so we open the door.

398
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:56,600
I will store?

399
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:12,400
You know the rules.
No soft drinks upstairs.

400
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:15,800
I just wanted a drink.

401
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:38,100
Breakfast is served.

402
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,000
Nora, bedtime.

403
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:57,900
Good night.

404
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:04,400
Can not sleep?
- How did you find me?

405
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,900
Call it a gamble.

406
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:22,900
Why you say 'Gillian' to your mother
instead of Mom?

407
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:27,000
She is my mother.
- What do you mean?

408
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:31,900
My father has been married before.
And my mother died when I was little.

409
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:36,400
Gillian is my stepmother, and Ian and Nora
My half-brother and sister.

410
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:40,000
I'm the freak of the family.

411
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:42,300
He must have hurt you
when he left.

412
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:44,400
He'll come back to me.

413
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:47,300
I know he is not the world best dad
but he loves me.

414
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:50,900
And he let me not alone.

415
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:59,300
You should not climb on the roof,
that is not safe.

416
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:01,600
Please do not say that I
should not be.

417
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:04,000
Here I can chill.

418
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:07,600
I wanted to make a railing.

419
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:11,100
Are you bribe me so
I like you?

420
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:14,400
I just want you safe.

421
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:24,300
Can I chill with you?
- It's a free country.

422
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:34,900
Look at that star?

423
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:52,400
Good news. We have an address.

424
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:59,700
Well, take what men and
get that file back.

425
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:07,000
No survivors.

426
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:10,900
Boss, you find that?

427
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:17,800
Not nice?

428
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:26,600
May I propose a few fashion?

429
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:29,600
Women do not like
the shirt is tucked there.

430
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:32,200
Do you see her through the war.

431
00:45:32,300 --> 00:45:35,900
Do you know anything about fashion?
- No, but I know the women.

432
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:41,000
Wear it so. That's cool.
I have seen in the film.

433
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:44,900
What movie? Octopussy?
It is not 1985.

434
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,300
That I almost forgot.
- What is that?

435
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:51,100
Iggy Pop and David Bowie in Shanghai.

436
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:55,300
That is the greatest concert
of the world.

437
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:58,900
I guarantee that no school
in this district has.

438
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:02,500
Have you downloaded this for me?
- No worries, I've paid for.

439
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:06,200
How do you know this?
- Simple. I was there.

440
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:17,900
Bob, you are too efficient.
We are half hour early.

441
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,400
You are welcome.

442
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:24,700
Happy days.

443
00:46:28,100 --> 00:46:30,900
Another cool?
- Thanks again.

444
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:34,000
Whatever.

445
00:46:57,800 --> 00:46:59,700
Happy days.

446
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,900
That conversation on the roof, does
not that we're friends.

447
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,400
God forbid.

448
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:28,800
There is none.

449
00:47:28,900 --> 00:47:33,300
I've cracked the computer, but the file
is downloaded to an external device.

450
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:36,400
I can not find STATS.

451
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:40,800
I think I have just discovered
who live here.

452
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:43,800
Agent Ho.

453
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:58,500
Stop shooting at things.

454
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:01,100
I said it really was like the CIA
whether the Chinese had.

455
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:06,100
But he is both. Find him.
But keep him alive.

456
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:10,300
I need to know to whom he
This effort has shown.

457
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:18,800
Listen. Here.

458
00:48:20,700 --> 00:48:24,300
We must find CIA agent.

459
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:27,600
He is very cunning. The best.

460
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:31,600
It is not easy to find.
Not now.

461
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:35,100
Imagine that you're Chinese.
Well trained.

462
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:39,200
And you want to disappear.
- I see him climbing on the roof with stuff.

463
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:43,100
He is not Conan the Barbarian.
Good try.

464
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:46,100
I see him. There.

465
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:52,800
Hurry.

466
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:55,400
Get him down.

467
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:58,200
Kill him not.
We need information.

468
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:16,700
Come here, sweetie.
Come back.

469
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:20,700
Here.

470
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:30,300
Let go.

471
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:35,800
Let go.

472
00:49:35,900 --> 00:49:38,800
Can you hold my turtle.
- Not now.

473
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:49,700
Hold on.

474
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:53,000
There you pay for.

475
00:50:08,700 --> 00:50:10,600
Again.

476
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:22,400
Why have you brought us out of school?
- What does it matter. We are Fri

477
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:24,700
Why are you also on the front seat?
It is my day.

478
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:29,700
No, it is not.
- It's my day.

479
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:31,900
You're lying.
- No.

480
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,400
You sit there all of two days in a row.
- Silence.

481
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:38,100
I'm still hungry.

482
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:47,100
I do not think they have chicken legs.

483
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:51,100
Waiting inside.
I need to call.

484
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:02,000
This is firefly.
- By Bob Ho. I need help.

485
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:10,700
I get good grades at this university.
Best of the classroom. I would not brag.

486
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:13,500
Bob, this is Larry.
- Pleasant, sir.

487
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,400
Let's go get food.
- He goes to college.

488
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:19,200
He is a poet. Cool right?

489
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:25,000
He is rare. He is amazing.

490
00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:28,100
He is the man.

491
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:32,000
Come on.

492
00:51:32,700 --> 00:51:34,900
What embarrassing.

493
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:39,900
Most people may not be the first me
time they meet me. Larry is.

494
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:45,300
I have two words for you, Larry.
Thirteen.

495
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:06,700
I must.
- But come on.

496
00:52:07,300 --> 00:52:10,400
You stay at the table.

497
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:17,000
I can not go.

498
00:52:25,900 --> 00:52:30,600
Note Pigs.

499
00:52:32,300 --> 00:52:35,600
Careful.

500
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:46,900
The lion jumped on them, and I
I killed him with my bare hands.

501
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,500
And I have saved the life colonels.
- You're brave.

502
00:52:49,700 --> 00:52:51,200
Thank you.

503
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,400
What do you think of this, Bob?

504
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:56,100
Nora and the waitress said
that Larry could sit here.

505
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:58,900
Is not that great.
- He has "Spade" invited or something.

506
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,500
We just kidding.

507
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:04,600
Nora, knock, knock.
- Who is it?

508
00:53:04,700 --> 00:53:07,300
Irish Stew.
- Irish Stew, who?

509
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:10,600
Irish Stew in the name of the law.

510
00:53:12,300 --> 00:53:15,500
Larry tells me everything about the university.
It sounds great.

511
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:17,900
I want you ever around.
- Calm down.

512
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,700
That decision not you.
You're not my father.

513
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:23,300
No, but I know that your mother
is not completely lost her mind.

514
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:27,700
It's just a tour.
He asks me out or anything.

515
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:30,300
Really?

516
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:33,300
It is but a kind offer.

517
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:36,400
Even though it was a date, it could
you do not stop me.

518
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,300
Where you study towards it?

519
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:46,600
English literature.
- Would you pass the soy sauce?

520
00:53:47,700 --> 00:53:50,800
So I get my background in the classes.

521
00:53:50,900 --> 00:53:54,100
Thank you.
- Please.

522
00:53:55,400 --> 00:54:00,300
You speak Russian.
- What is going on?

523
00:54:18,900 --> 00:54:23,400
This is painful.
- You are right in.

524
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:27,300
Hurry.

525
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:37,700
Maybe write a poem about here?

526
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:03,600
Well, he is too old for me.

527
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:07,500
I want a princess anymore,
but a cyborg.

528
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,700
How he found me so quickly?
That makes no sense.

529
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:14,200
Bob, what is going on?
- Still, I try to think.

530
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,800
Well.

531
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:23,700
I'm an international spy and
I'm with the CIA.

532
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:27,100
Of the Chinese CIA.
Someone wants me dead.

533
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:30,700
And Larry was a Russian spy.

534
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:33,600
Well, tell us not.

535
00:55:34,100 --> 00:55:36,400
Cool.

536
00:55:40,100 --> 00:55:43,300
Why is that came?

537
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:46,200
Stay here.

538
00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:50,300
Where are the kids?
- Inside.

539
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:53,000
Nothing is more out until
the children are safe.

540
00:55:53,100 --> 00:55:56,300
Of course. Colton has a secure home
regularly, as you requested.

541
00:55:57,400 --> 00:56:00,500
Did you file with you?
- Which file?

542
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:03,300
Your download those sent by Colton
Poldark of his computer.

543
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:06,500
I have nothing downloaded.
I did not even open anything.

544
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:09,800
Take me in the leg. This is secret
material. I have all the necessary copies.

545
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:13,000
Why do you think I have something gedownkoad.
Unless someone told you that.

546
00:56:13,100 --> 00:56:14,500
Someone who wanted it back.

547
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:18,000
Let's not more difficult than
it is. Give me that file.

548
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:21,100
You're a Korean officer.
Why are you doing this?

549
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:23,400
I want to get out. Same as you.
We step out there both for love.

550
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:24,400
I just love money.

551
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:28,100
And Anton Poldark is match.com.
The file.

552
00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:42,200
Good work.

553
00:56:46,900 --> 00:56:52,300
Can I say you're the best man
that my mother has so far selected.

554
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:55,100
Now at least I know how Larry
found us so quickly.

555
00:56:55,300 --> 00:56:57,000
How?
- The watch.

556
00:56:57,100 --> 00:57:01,000
Curtis told me that I had to keep watch.
There is a tracking device in it.

557
00:57:04,300 --> 00:57:08,900
You're really a spy.
- Gillian goes from her roof.

558
00:57:29,100 --> 00:57:30,900
What are you doing?

559
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:35,000
There is iron in these rocks. This hides
a signal. Please watch.

560
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:40,600
When I tell this story in school, get
I am one years sentence for lying.

561
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:49,400
Yes?
- Hi, partner.

562
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:51,700
Where are you?

563
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:55,400
Why do you ask?
- I had to pick up the sent file.

564
00:57:55,500 --> 00:57:58,400
The one you had open.

565
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,400
Are you there?

566
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:07,200
I never saw you as a traitor.
- That's crazy, man.

567
00:58:07,300 --> 00:58:10,400
There is something wrong,
We must come together and talk.

568
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:13,600
Nice try.

569
00:58:21,700 --> 00:58:23,700
We are safe here, promised.

570
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:26,500
This is your plan?
Hide in a hotel?

571
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:29,900
They also seem not to have chicken legs.

572
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:49,700
This is great.
Shall we call room service?

573
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:52,500
Are you crazy. I'm going home.
- No.

574
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:55,900
You're only safe with me.
- If you?

575
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:59,400
Everyone wants you dead.
- Yes. Great, right?

576
00:58:59,500 --> 00:59:04,300
If you want to marry my mom,
I personally write the invitations.

577
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:35,000
I love you, Bob.

578
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:50,900
Infinite Bob.

579
00:59:53,600 --> 00:59:55,500
Hello.
- Hi, Gillian.

580
00:59:55,600 --> 00:59:59,700
Hi, honey. Grandpa just sleeping.
I just wanted to call.

581
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:02,000
I must tell you something.

582
01:00:02,100 --> 01:00:05,100
This will hurt you down,
but I must say.

583
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:07,300
You okay?

584
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:10,100
Yes. It's about Bob.

585
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:13,000
What then?
- It's not who you think.

586
01:00:13,100 --> 01:00:16,300
He is a Chinese spy.
Terrorists want to kill him...

587
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:21,100
and now the CIA is after him...
- Farren, I know you do not...

588
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:24,000
but I do not expect Ian
but not yours.

589
01:00:24,100 --> 01:00:28,300
What? It is true.
He is still our death.

590
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:31,900
Farren, this conversation is over.
Give me Bob.

591
01:00:39,100 --> 01:00:44,200
Hi, Gillian.
- I'm sorry. I am not sure what she has.

592
01:00:45,700 --> 01:00:47,900
It is the truth.
- What?

593
01:00:48,700 --> 01:00:51,700
All she said.

594
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:54,500
What this is, it is not funny.

595
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:58,200
The children are safe.
I provide them, if you're back.

596
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:02,800
You tell me so that I my
children left behind by a madman?

597
01:01:05,300 --> 01:01:09,000
Come and get it also.

598
01:01:26,200 --> 01:01:29,800
Do you have cool spy stuff,
outside the watch?

599
01:01:35,500 --> 01:01:37,500
Do not touch.

600
01:01:37,600 --> 01:01:39,400
Very sharp.

601
01:01:39,500 --> 01:01:41,600
What else?

602
01:02:07,500 --> 01:02:09,800
Sorry.

603
01:02:10,600 --> 01:02:13,000
Airport. Hit it.

604
01:02:32,600 --> 01:02:37,500
Bob, are you awake?
- Really?

605
01:02:37,900 --> 01:02:41,800
He always snore?
- Do you hear even here?

606
01:02:41,900 --> 01:02:45,500
I always thought it was the pig.

607
01:02:47,300 --> 01:02:50,400
It's over between you and Gillian, huh?

608
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:54,900
Yes, it's over.

609
01:02:55,700 --> 01:02:57,600
You win.

610
01:02:57,700 --> 01:03:00,000
Why does it not then?

611
01:03:00,100 --> 01:03:03,600
If you really love her,
you would not easily give up.

612
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:08,200
It is because I love her
and you keep three...

613
01:03:08,300 --> 01:03:13,600
I should leave.
Your security is important.

614
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:18,000
I thought I was my other life
could forget, but I can not.

615
01:03:18,100 --> 01:03:22,700
Be happy. You're lucky you
This family is not together.

616
01:03:24,100 --> 01:03:28,700
You have no idea what it is like
you live where you do not belong.

617
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:34,300
Do not be sure.
I grew up an orphanage.

618
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:37,500
I never knew my parents,
but I had a family.

619
01:03:37,600 --> 01:03:43,600
I had numerous brothers and sisters.
Without some kinship.

620
01:03:44,300 --> 01:03:46,800
But I loved them all.

621
01:03:47,800 --> 01:03:51,300
Family is not about blood...

622
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:54,800
but you love
and who loves you.

623
01:04:03,100 --> 01:04:05,500
Mom.
- Gillian.

624
01:04:11,100 --> 01:04:16,000
Gillian, I'm sorry for everything.

625
01:04:20,500 --> 01:04:23,300
Tell me the truth.

626
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:25,900
Are you really a spy?

627
01:04:26,700 --> 01:04:30,100
Yes. I wanted to tell you...

628
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:32,900
but you interrupted me.
- That I do not care.

629
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:36,400
You brought my children in danger.

630
01:04:36,500 --> 01:04:39,100
Just go.

631
01:04:46,300 --> 01:04:49,400
If we see you again?

632
01:04:49,500 --> 01:04:52,000
Not.

633
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:05,500
Please do not.
Who sings Chinese songs for me then?

634
01:05:14,700 --> 01:05:19,500
They were safe, promised.
- Stay away from my children.

635
01:06:05,700 --> 01:06:09,800
Dearest Mama, I'm sorry,
but I can not stay here.

636
01:06:09,900 --> 01:06:13,200
My destiny is to be a spy,
just like Bob.

637
01:06:17,600 --> 01:06:24,000
I go with him.
Love, your son Ian.

638
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:04,900
The signal was getting right back on.

639
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:06,900
We have him.

640
01:07:07,800 --> 01:07:10,500
Action.

641
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:41,400
You leave your watch.
- What are you doing here?

642
01:07:41,500 --> 01:07:45,900
We must go.
- Why, we just got here.

643
01:07:57,500 --> 01:08:01,200
What a coincidence.
Tie him up.

644
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:12,200
What are you doing here?
- I want it, I would also be a spy.

645
01:08:12,700 --> 01:08:17,200
Is that bad? I expected
he would be better dressed.

646
01:08:18,200 --> 01:08:19,700
How did you find me?

647
01:08:19,800 --> 01:08:23,600
I stuck one of your opspoorapparaatjes
in your pocket.

648
01:08:23,800 --> 01:08:26,200
Impressive.
- Thank you.

649
01:08:26,400 --> 01:08:29,700
Are we back in business?
- I am retired you know.

650
01:08:29,800 --> 01:08:33,700
If someone download no secrets.
- I have never downloaded.

651
01:08:33,800 --> 01:08:36,700
He is lying.
- Who do you...

652
01:08:36,800 --> 01:08:38,900
me, or the traitor?

653
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:43,300
Someone here has been very naughty.

654
01:08:43,400 --> 01:08:47,200
He has cameras everywhere
and microphones placed.

655
01:08:47,300 --> 01:08:53,300
A good plan to film us together.
- How can you turn back the country?

656
01:08:53,400 --> 01:08:58,100
Simple. I am a multi millionaire.
That file you downloaded is not...

657
01:08:58,200 --> 01:09:03,800
is a formula for a bacterial hybrid.
This stuff literally eat oil.

658
01:09:03,900 --> 01:09:09,000
Imagine. All world oil
go at night in one way.

659
01:09:09,100 --> 01:09:12,800
Apart from Russia,
which are gold.

660
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:17,800
Colton How have you convinced?
- Colton, who has nothing to do here.

661
01:09:17,900 --> 01:09:21,500
He has no idea what is happening.
For him is really struggling.

662
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:24,400
Let the boy go.
He has nothing to do.

663
01:09:24,500 --> 01:09:29,100
Mr. tetterkont here has
just told the whole plan.

664
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:35,000
We can not let him go.
He will tell.

665
01:09:35,100 --> 01:09:38,500
Trust me, nobody believes him.

666
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:40,800
He has a point.

667
01:09:42,200 --> 01:09:46,600
Baas. Look what I found.

668
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:52,600
Hello everyone.
- Please sit down.

669
01:09:52,700 --> 01:09:55,500
This is not true.

670
01:09:55,600 --> 01:09:59,900
Poldark, if you let the children go,
I think that you file for GBH.

671
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:03,700
GBH, GBH like Stockholm?

672
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:07,100
How do you know?
- It kidding.

673
01:10:07,200 --> 01:10:09,900
Is all this because
He downloaded a concert?

674
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,500
What has he done?

675
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:17,300
Did you downloaded?
- You take piracy seriously.

676
01:10:17,500 --> 01:10:20,100
You've played with my PC?
That is private.

677
01:10:20,300 --> 01:10:24,900
I just wanted to be cool.
- No need, that you already

678
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:28,200
One of the coolest person I know.
- Really?

679
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,700
Here, a man with a gun.

680
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:36,100
Wait, I'm the only child you know.

681
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:41,500
Where is the file?
- On my iPod, home to the office.

682
01:10:42,600 --> 01:10:46,500
If you really want to be a spy,
you should never tell the truth.

683
01:10:46,600 --> 01:10:48,900
Sorry, this is still new to me.

684
01:10:49,700 --> 01:10:53,500
Take people into
to his house and find the iPod.

685
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:57,200
What if his family home?

686
01:10:57,400 --> 01:11:00,300
Since you've dyed your hair blond...
Take them off.

687
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:05,800
No, no!
- Come, Bring me the iPod.

688
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:21,500
And as for you...

689
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:10,200
Farren, we go.

690
01:12:10,300 --> 01:12:14,700
I sit up front and decide the radio channel.

691
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,700
Hello?
- Gillian, listen to me.

692
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:29,200
Goodbye, Bob.

693
01:12:36,200 --> 01:12:39,600
Wait! Do not hang on.

694
01:12:41,900 --> 01:12:44,900
We have more than them.

695
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:54,500
Is there someone you vertouwt,
you can call the office?

696
01:12:54,600 --> 01:12:57,900
Jule, but they took all my cameras.
I can not prove anything.

697
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:03,700
Except when that happened,
I recorded everything on my phone.

698
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:07,100
Well done, idiot.

699
01:13:09,100 --> 01:13:14,000
Colt. Listen to me.
I play something for you.

700
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:29,100
What is this?
- This is Halloween.

701
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:46,600
What are you doing here?
I thought you were upstairs.

702
01:13:46,700 --> 01:13:49,300
Everyone quickly inside.
- Bob, we need to talk.

703
01:13:49,400 --> 01:13:53,000
Mom, this is no joke.
Do what he says.

704
01:13:54,700 --> 01:13:58,500
Find your iPod.
- IPod? I demand an explanation.

705
01:13:58,600 --> 01:13:59,900
They are coming.
- Who?

706
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,200
The Russians.
- Russians?

707
01:14:17,200 --> 01:14:20,100
They are there.

708
01:14:20,500 --> 01:14:24,600
Russians?
- Yes, keep you informed.

709
01:14:26,800 --> 01:14:28,900
Quick, everyone up.

710
01:14:30,900 --> 01:14:33,000
Stay there.

711
01:14:36,200 --> 01:14:39,400
Where is my stuff?
- Here, have some of this stuff.

712
01:14:39,500 --> 01:14:41,600
What things are they?
- Protection.

713
01:14:43,300 --> 01:14:46,400
Why did you a lighter?
I do not want you play with fire.

714
01:14:53,600 --> 01:14:55,900
Okay, just this once.
Let's go.

715
01:15:50,400 --> 01:15:54,300
What do you suggest?
- A Cyborg from the future...

716
01:15:54,500 --> 01:15:57,200
to blow you away.

717
01:16:04,400 --> 01:16:06,600
Mama, that man could fly.

718
01:16:30,700 --> 01:16:32,800
I can not believe in us
have done this.

719
01:16:32,900 --> 01:16:35,300
You have my children at risk.
- It is never my intention.

720
01:16:35,400 --> 01:16:37,900
I love your kids.
I want to marry you.

721
01:16:39,100 --> 01:16:41,000
And I with you.

722
01:16:41,100 --> 01:16:43,800
But our wedding gifts to open
by the Mine Action Service.

723
01:16:43,900 --> 01:16:47,400
Okay Bob, played enough games now.

724
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:57,600
I'm finally a regular
man, someone who...

725
01:16:59,400 --> 01:17:02,200
Can we talk about this later?

726
01:17:21,100 --> 01:17:23,200
A belt?

727
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:36,000
Give me the Ipod.

728
01:17:40,600 --> 01:17:44,000
Come to his house.

729
01:17:54,700 --> 01:17:56,400
Hi, guys.

730
01:17:57,700 --> 01:17:59,400
I have to go.

731
01:17:59,500 --> 01:18:02,600
Maybe we should only
steal candy from small children.

732
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:13,200
This is fun.
- Hey Larry, knock knock...

733
01:18:33,400 --> 01:18:35,400
Fast in your room
and put the door.

734
01:18:55,500 --> 01:18:58,800
I arrest you in the name of the law.

735
01:18:59,300 --> 01:19:02,500
Sorry that my timing is so
bad, Bob.

736
01:19:05,700 --> 01:19:08,500
Kill me and let the family go.
- They have seen too much.

737
01:19:08,600 --> 01:19:10,600
But you go first,
then you do not look.

738
01:19:10,700 --> 01:19:12,400
Hey, mister...

739
01:19:18,500 --> 01:19:20,600
Do not think this changes anything.

740
01:19:20,900 --> 01:19:24,200
Everybody stop!
- It is in order...

741
01:19:24,400 --> 01:19:26,100
they are good.

742
01:19:46,300 --> 01:19:51,000
Do something looser.
- Sorry, the handcuffs are too tight?

743
01:19:51,100 --> 01:19:55,100
I do not know how they worked,
I'm just a hillbilly.

744
01:19:56,500 --> 01:19:59,500
Does everyone like it?
- On some bumps and scratches after.

745
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:02,200
This is one of the really good people.

746
01:20:05,300 --> 01:20:11,100
What have you here.
Good job you took that call.

747
01:20:11,200 --> 01:20:14,400
This young man can sometimes
be a good spy.

748
01:20:23,100 --> 01:20:26,300
How fast can you get me out of this suit?

749
01:20:27,900 --> 01:20:31,400
Sorry I accused you.
- No problem, buddy.

750
01:20:31,600 --> 01:20:34,400
Let's at
an account.

751
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:36,800
Thank you.

752
01:20:47,900 --> 01:20:51,500
Sorry to you all this
had to make them.

753
01:20:52,600 --> 01:20:55,600
Goodbye, Gillian.

754
01:20:56,700 --> 01:20:59,800
Goodbye, kids.

755
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:07,000
I will miss you.

756
01:21:07,100 --> 01:21:09,400
I miss you too.

757
01:21:15,900 --> 01:21:17,800
Wait.

758
01:21:18,200 --> 01:21:24,600
I know he lied,
but he did to protect us.

759
01:21:27,100 --> 01:21:28,200
Mama?

760
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:36,000
You'll never again find such a man as Bob.

761
01:21:36,400 --> 01:21:38,000
Never.

762
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:43,800
Never thought to say this again,
but I agree with Farren.

763
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
You'll probably also be here
what to say about it?

764
01:21:50,200 --> 01:21:53,300
I want my dad Bob.

765
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:10,600
Do you, Gillian, Bob to be your lawful husband?
- Yes.

766
01:22:11,200 --> 01:22:14,700
And you Bob, do you Gillian
to be your lawful husband?

767
01:22:17,400 --> 01:22:19,400
Gillian.

768
01:22:19,600 --> 01:22:26,200
There is one thing you must know,
My name is not really Bob.

769
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:30,400
That's okay.

770
01:22:31,400 --> 01:22:33,500
Yes.

771
01:22:33,700 --> 01:22:35,600
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

772
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,600
You may kiss the bride.

773
01:22:50,500 --> 01:22:53,700
Ready and action.

774
01:23:18,500 --> 01:23:20,800
He is a crook, he could eat nails...

775
01:23:20,900 --> 01:23:24,100
The boy takes all free.
Take him to blame.

776
01:23:24,200 --> 01:23:27,400
That is such a crook, he could eat nails...

777
01:23:51,100 --> 01:23:56,800
Bob, I want a princess anymore
but...

778
01:23:57,800 --> 01:24:02,300
I'm an international spy.
I belong to the CIA...

779
01:24:02,400 --> 01:24:06,900
From the Chinese...

780
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:12,000
I grab some stuff and we
go to the house.

781
01:24:15,400 --> 01:24:20,100
I'm an international spy.
I belong to the CIA. From the Chinese...

782
01:24:20,200 --> 01:24:22,000
Information...

783
01:24:22,100 --> 01:24:25,900
I've shot down dictators.
How difficult is it to 'three' to say.

784
01:24:32,700 --> 01:24:37,100
Maybe write a poem about...

785
01:24:37,200 --> 01:24:40,300
Maybe you drive a poem about...

786
01:24:40,400 --> 01:24:45,900
Maybe you write...
He english.

787
01:24:52,200 --> 01:24:55,600
And the man you married,
who marries you all four.

788
01:24:56,400 --> 01:25:00,500
Forget the pig, and cat
and not the turkey. The turkey...

789
01:25:02,400 --> 01:25:05,700
Turkey.
Where did that come from turkey?

790
01:25:06,300 --> 01:25:09,100
My grandmother...
Sorry.

791
01:25:12,400 --> 01:25:14,600
My grandmother is...

792
01:25:16,600 --> 01:25:19,600
If they screw up, then
I am happy.

793
01:25:20,500 --> 01:25:23,600
Well done.
Come out.

794
01:25:23,700 --> 01:25:25,800
The camera needs you.

795
01:25:26,700 --> 01:25:30,500
What are you doing?
- What are you doing? We are filming.

796
01:25:30,600 --> 01:25:32,700
We make a movie.

797
01:25:33,800 --> 01:25:36,000
Funny.

798
01:25:36,100 --> 01:25:38,800
Camera ready?

799
01:25:48,700 --> 01:25:51,200
Bye.
