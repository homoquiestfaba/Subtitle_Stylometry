They say it is something unreal:

55
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:16,320
Mickey, goofy and all that. I'd like 
to go there.

56
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,275

I'm actually making a movie about 
this quarter...

61
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:28,960
About this quarter?

62
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,154

Ready?

68
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:53,671
Today we're talking with Joe Head, a 
native of this area.

69
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,920
It may be better to use my real name?

70
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,800
So it will be more correct.

71
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,800
Real name? I thought the head is your 
last name.

72
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,234

somehow

75
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,992
I joked that my head is big...

76
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,800

do you feel here?

Anything else?

80
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:23,756
You know how it is, everything changes

81
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:27,273
people are born and die.

82
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,431
The liberals are buying up all the 
mansions.

83
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,829
Does it bother you?

84
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,078
Bit.

88
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,994
Maybe they think they're above it. I 
do not know.

89
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:46,552
Actually, I somehow managed to meet 
one.

90
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,600
Took her to my grandmother's house,

91
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,920

wine...

92
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,240

95
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,239
So what were you talking with that 
girl?

96
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,160
Well, I asked her if she wanted to 
watch porn

97
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,360
to relax a little.

98
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,640
Porn?

99
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,595
Nothing hard.

100
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,515
What happened next?

101
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:12,120
Then came my grandfather, damn him! 
Started to resent

102
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,640
what I'm going through his films 
without his knowledge.

103
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,595
And the girl left?

104
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:18,520
I was ashamed and I left.

105
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:19,520
Leaving her alone?

106
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:22,360

things to her.

Just someone wants to kill me.

126
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,000
Long story; nothing special.

127
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000

I stole his car.

135
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,520
Why did you do it?

136
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,317
There is a misunderstanding. I didn't 
know it was his car.

137
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,479
What happened to Jimmy.?

138
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,240

157
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,395

Yes.

161
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,671
God, Yes, he had a really huge head.

162
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,393
Joe, you have a head size?

163
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:51,795
Don't know 12.

164
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:53,955
Lord Jesus!

165
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,717
Guys, meet Les. He's making a movie.

166
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,435
Hi. Ed..

167
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:04,829
Hi. Tommy..

168
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,394
And this is my father Harold..

169
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,237
Have a seat. The chair over there.

170
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,957
Heard about my son Jimmy?

171
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,795
Yes. I'm really sorry.

172
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:24,992
He was gone. Once and was gone, 
vanished into thin air.

173
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,629
What can you do...

174
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:39,118
You know, Les is making a movie about 
this quarter.

175
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:42,040
With many it seems, talking.

176
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,680
Maybe he will be able to find out 
anything about Jimmy,

177
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,318
on his whereabouts.

178
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,193
With God's help...

179
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,758
I can't believe what a huge head!

180
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:00,835
Les, what do you say we get 
interviews?

181
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,398
Happily, if you don't mind.

182
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,240
I don't mind.

183
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,195
Why not.

184
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:20,877
Tell the old man to a Bathrobe tie. 
His dick sticking out.

185
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,269
Hey, dad.

186
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,717
The old man's huge cock, right, mom?

187
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,195
Shut up.

188
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,752
Okay, let's start.

189
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,680
Want me something to sing to begin 
with?

190
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,040
Ed.. one of the brothers.

191
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:39,075
It's not necessary.

192
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,155
As you wish.

193
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,636
Ed, I understand missing your brother 
Jimmy.

194
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Yes, that's right.

195
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,319
When did you see him last?

196
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,920
Can I just explain?

197
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:49,875
Of course.

198
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,480
You know that my brother Jimmy's 
glass eye?

199
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,480
Really?

200
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,560
Tommy.. one of the brothers.

201
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,400
He is not very well fixed and is 
moved from place to place...

202
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,355
When he lost his eye?

203
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,875
About 4 years ago.

204
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,671
I was just in shock!

205
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,029
Did you know that your brother is 
missing one eye?

206
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:10,709
No, I didn't.

207
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,952
But that explains a few things...

208
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,275
Like what?

209
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:19,200
Now I remember about 4 years

210
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,720
ago that Jimmy was acting kind of 
weird.

211
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,792
How? As my Jimmy could behave?

212
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,069
In my opinion,

213
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:30,919
his behavior suddenly became strange.

214
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:35,115
Perhaps life was starting to feel 
like Jimmy insoluble riddle.

215
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,832
He seemed to have lost their clarity.

216
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,355
Well you bent.

217
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,795
Stop.

218
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,640
Maybe Jimmy ran away from home?

219
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,920
I understand it. What a family!

220
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:07,150
An old man with his farm out!

221
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,920
Damn! It Lefti! I have to go, dude!

222
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,798
Come on! Come on! Catch me! Catch!

223
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:33,840
How's life?

224
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,400
What happened? He stole your car.

225
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,913
Yes, he stole my car...

226
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,953
And then sold it to my brother.

227
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:40,875
Who, Lanny?

228
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,235
No, the other.

229
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,597
- George?
- Yes, another brother.

230
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,035
Frankie?

231
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:49,320
Yes, Frankie. Well, he's a jerk! 
Didn't even know what to buy

232
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:52,471
my stolen car. I was going to sell it 
to him.

233
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,520
So you would anyway have sold it to 
Frankie?

234
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,999
Well, Yes. Incredible!

235
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,511
How do you do? Lefty Gladden.

236
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,920
You know, Les grew up in these places!

237
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,399
Really? Me too.

238
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,196
Junior said he lost Jimmy..

239
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,075
Jimmy there?

240
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,354
Jimmy here.

241
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,193
<u> A One - Eyed Jimmy? <u> A One - 
Eyed Jimmy.</u>

242
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,440
No kidding? Where did he go?

243
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,395
Nobody knows.

244
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:17,795
Lefty,

245
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,229
and what do you know about Jimmy?

246
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:23,795
Who is that?

247
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,475
He's with me.

248
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:27,954
A strange...

249
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,675
Bit.

250
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,668
So what do I know about Jimmy...

251
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,360
Lefty Gladden. the owner of the car

252
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,511
He's from a good family. I know him 
forever.

253
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,710
His brothers ed and Tommy are the 
good guys.

254
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,633
Yes, ed and Tommy are the good guys.

255
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,559
And he worked for, Jimmy?

256
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,560
Brought the children across the road.

257
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:47,800
Jimmy loved children.

258
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,119
Yes, Jimmy loved children.

259
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,240
It's not easy to control traffic

260
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,000
to translate the children and all 
with one eye.

261
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,280
In fact, it tried to fire, but Jimmy

262
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,510
regularly come to work every day.

263
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,359
Jimmy was devoted to his work.

264
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,640
He went to school before his 
disappearance?

265
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,595
He had part-time employment.

266
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:07,520
Three days a week. He translated 
children

267
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:09,520
exclusively on the right side of the 
street.

268
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:12,080
Translated children exclusively on 
the right side of the street?

269
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:16,229
He was just there and saw oncoming 
traffic.

270
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:24,040
You know, if you want to know about 
Jimmy more

271
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:26,080
let's talk with Disco Bean.

272
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,080
Who's Disco Bean?

273
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,000
Who's Disco Bean?! He is the best

274
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,877
dancer in Brooklyn. He is the friend 
of Jimmy.

275
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,438
I thought Disco anymore.

276
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,600
He died? And nobody told me.

277
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,560
No. I'm talking about the style of 
music: disco.

278
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,471
Does anyone still dancing disco?

279
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,120
In General it is. Only he doesn't say.

280
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:49,000
For him it is a very touchy subject.

281
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,070
Yes, a very touchy subject.

282
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,397
Come on, I know where to find it.

283
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,913
Lord! Incredible!

284
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:03,957
It's Younger and he's got my car!

285
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,553
See you later, Shorty!

286
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,672
And here is the Disco Bin.

287
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:35,639
Disco Bin. a local celebrity.

288
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,871
This guy is stuck in time.

289
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:42,993
Yeah, but he's a cool dancer!

290
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,589
Let's go talk with him.

291
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,636
You go, and I'll wait here.

292
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,315
Why?

293
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:01,993
Bean is very temperamental. He 
doesn't like it when it separates 
from the case.

294
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,595
I'll be careful.

295
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,275
It's your business.

296
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:21,795
Good move.

297
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,040
Good move... you Yourself move well!

298
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:28,113
I'm the best. Number one! Disco Bean!

299
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,833
And why are you dancing in the 
warehouse?

300
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,720
Are you one of those crazy employers?

301
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,080
And where am I supposed to dance in 
the library?

302
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:39,435
I'm a free hearted man. I need the 
space!

303
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,840
This is my ballroom,

304
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:44,195
and that's where I come up with new 
moves.

305
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,590
I see you are copying my moves, Joe!

306
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:55,880
Hey Joe, I see how you imitate me!

307
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,313
I wanted to talk to you about Jimmy..

308
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:58,680
What about him?

309
00:14:58,680 --> 00:14:59,680
You know what he's missing?

310
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:00,680
The first time I hear it.

311
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:03,114
As far as I know, you were with Jimmy 
when he lost his eye.

312
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,436
Yes. I found him.

313
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,758
How did you find him? What do you 
mean?

314
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,000
Point the camera at me! Point the 
camera at me!

315
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,673
Yes, I Brooklyn Baryshnikov, damn it!

316
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
How did this happen?

317
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,035
- With Jimmy? <u> Yes.

318
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,760
I was minding my own business on the 
dance floor,

319
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,720
and Jimmy was partying with T. R. in 
that corner.

320
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,360
Having fun with T. R.?

321
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:29,160
Some slut was giving him head, I 
don't remember her name

322
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:31,960
in my opinion Regina. They are still 
at each other shooting...

323
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,080
Shot each other?

324
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,960
You all need to chew something?

325
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,791
Pellets shot from toy guns.

326
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:42,676
In short, I'm here, dancing, and 
Jimmy over in the corner...

327
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:49,316
together with T. Ar. Both fired at 
each other.

328
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:55,000
Jimmy cums in her mouth, she turns 
away to spit.

329
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,440
At this point, Jimmy is about to 
leave when suddenly

330
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,795
notice that the girl's going to spit 
his gift.

331
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:03,795
He told her, and said, save it for 
yourself, baby.

332
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,400
Then he turns around and - ahhh!

333
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,277
She shot him straight in the eye.

334
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:11,279
Look, eyes somewhere rolled...

335
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:17,630
I immediately turn off the music, 
took out a handkerchief and look up 
from the floor.

336
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,912
Somewhere I read that these things 
need to be kept cold.

337
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,440
What body part fell off, it should

338
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,556
need to be placed in the cold before 
the arrival of doctors.

339
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,751
The only cold item appeared

340
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,800
a can of Coca Cola. I opened the jar 
and threw it in there eyes.

341
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,760
At this time the doctors arrive,

342
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,716
I stretch one jar of the drink.

343
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:38,840
And he decided that I did want to 
thank this way.

344
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,960
He was about to drink, when suddenly

345
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,996
I was screaming: Stop! There eyes!

346
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:47,353
As a result of it not sewn.

347
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:51,271
In the quarter and did just what I 
said, what I am a hero.

348
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,754
Even presented the letter. That's the 
whole story.

349
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:57,760
Wow story!

350
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:58,954
We do not get bored.

351
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:00,949
Come on, help me to practice.

352
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:02,720
I? And how can I help?

353
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,914
I need a partner...

354
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,789
...to learn a new movement.

355
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:07,555
I can't.

356
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,074
Come on, I'm not a faggot.

357
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:10,720
No, really.

358
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:11,675
Come on, man!

359
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:14,271
- I'm serious.
- I'm not a faggot.

360
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,720
I feel really weird.

361
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:16,720
I think I'm a fag?

362
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,720
No.

363
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,392
Well. Now relax.

364
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,040
I need help. Relax.

365
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,634
There is nothing complicated.

366
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,755
Trust me, I'm a man. I am.

367
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,034
What's the matter? Relax.

368
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:49,916
Yay! Finally, you move like human 
beings! Yes! Yes! That's a lot!

369
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,195
Oh, shit.

370
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,794
Look what you did with the pants made.

371
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,919
What you did with the pants made?!

372
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:59,559
Get out of there! Take your camera 
and get out!

373
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,640
All. The shooting ended!

374
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:05,040
Junior, buy yourself new glasses 
finally!

375
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,632
All right, let's go!

376
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:21,153
Get outta here, man. You're here 
blurred. Go on, get out!

377
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,960
I had the opportunity to shoot truly

378
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,554
good movie, something truly 
extraordinary...

379
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,600
The whole story with Jimmy....

380
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:44,233
If he suddenly turns up dead, God 
forbid, it means not destiny.

381
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:47,160
And suddenly happens something 
unexpected

382
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,390
and we'll be lucky. Maybe we'll even 
get some reward.

383
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,593
Can't believe it!

384
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,195
Oh, look who's coming...

385
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,872
Will not help homeless animals?

386
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,280
I beg your pardon?

387
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,350
Homeless animals. Animals without 
shelter.

388
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,720
Would you like to make a donation?

389
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:08,675
And what of the animals?

390
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,951
Cats, dogs, horses.

391
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,240
Zebras, giraffes, lions.

392
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,880
We are all equal.

393
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:15,835
This worldwide event.

394
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,752
Is that all? Who is it going to help?

395
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:25,395
All the fines.

396
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:29,799
Buy a lottery ticket. Win
- Buick 79.

397
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,440
When drawing?

398
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,919
The 15th of September.

399
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,595
It's the last month.

400
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,919
Huh?! Have we missed a joke?

401
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,432
Why are we not informed?

402
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,309
It is now clear why we have not sold 
a single ticket.

403
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,555
Talk to you soon.

404
00:19:58,960 --> 00:19:59,915
But the Magician?

405
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:08,479
Hi, Les! Sit down! Sit down.

406
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,279
And you look good on the dance floor.

407
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,435
I saw with my own eyes how these two 
wanted to kill each other.

408
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,269
He shot at me.

409
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,920
And now they sit at the same tables 
and

410
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,592
trying to resolve peacefully.

411
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:29,320
Negotiation is the best solution to 
all problems. Am I right, guys?

412
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:32,517
Yes, Yes. There is a 
misunderstanding. It happens.

413
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:34,513
So you're not going to steal his car?

414
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,155
For the umpteenth time?

415
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:37,675
Both times.

416
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:41,240
You know what the cars doing: if only

417
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:44,516
to fool the buyer. One of the other 
not distinguish.

418
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,679
You didn't know that this car Lefty?

419
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,400
She seemed a bit familiar, but each

420
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,630
local chick I, too, seems a bit 
familiar.

421
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,480
Each local chick...

422
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:00,480
Like it?!

423
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,435
Cool, man.

424
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:12,553
Hey, guys, stop it!

425
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:16,680
What is wrong with you?! I thought we 
agreed on everything.

426
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:21,800
Dude, you broke my glasses! I posted 
37.50.

427
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:25,000
Use super-glue and everything will be 
fine.

428
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:29,475
Glue will not help here. Points cover!

429
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:35,272
Look, I've got one pair. I'll buy her.

430
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:39,269
What do I do with your glasses? These 
customized!

431
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,680
Maybe in the shop they will repair 
for free.

432
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,113
You have a warranty?!

433
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,595
Maybe there is.

434
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:51,510
Come on! No offense? Come here, come 
here.

435
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,668
You know, this story with Jimmy I was 
so intrigued.

436
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,840
I think we should inform the police.

437
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,432
I want to say the family haven't done?

438
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,080
No, did not.

439
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,638
Maybe we should tell them?

440
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:16,995
Yes, of course.

441
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,115
Tu mi cuando, man.

442
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,439
This is the only picture Jimmy?

443
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,720
What do you dislike?

444
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:28,675
Don't know

445
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,076
I think it's kind of weird.

446
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,595
I bet he's stoned.

447
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,960
So what! Yourself that you never 
tried?

448
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:36,915
How do you, Holly?

449
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,236
Bit more more capillaries on the nose.

450
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:47,072
Ellen, you know, not an Amateur in 
the business.

451
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,310
She teaches drawing at the prison.

452
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:04,390
That's a lot better. He has a lot of 
damaged capillaries...

453
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,519
Add a couple more.

454
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,199
What a freak!

455
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,558
Have you tried to contact the police?

456
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,075
Maybe they can help.

457
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:21,231
My ex-husband is a COP. They will not 
help.

458
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:25,549
It will not be worse. In the end they 
have more people.

459
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:28,280
Look, honey, I want to call the cops 
- call.

460
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:30,600
Overall it's just a bunch of cowardly 
wimps.

461
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:31,555
Wow!

462
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:35,875
Like?

463
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,400
Yes, he is handsome.

464
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,355
Yes.

465
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,320
Why not use photography?

466
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:44,912
Make a few copies and stick to the 
leaflet.

467
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,195
And what can be done.

468
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,237
Want to use a photo, please!

469
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:51,792
Every idiot considers himself an 
expert.

470
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:53,789
She called me an asshole?

471
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,520
She's talking about me.

472
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:56,520
Well.

473
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,240
Mrs., you won't mind

474
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,912
if we consider one leaflet to the 
police?

475
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:03,789
Do what you want.

476
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,840
I don't mind. Come tomorrow, 
everything will be ready.

477
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:10,795
Well.

478
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,670
You write portraits?

479
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:20,835
Just asking.

480
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:33,680
Good morning, red hook. It is 6:02 
am, outside the window

481
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:36,672
12 degrees and most of you are 
unemployed.

482
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:39,510
Remember, job center opens at 9 sharp.

483
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,795
Don't be late.

484
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:44,275
Hey, Les!

485
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,555
Les!

486
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:48,955
Hey, Les!

487
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:50,993
Yo, Les!

488
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,075
Les!

489
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,749
Someone saw Jimmy. Let's go!

490
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,313
You get to Les!

491
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,235
Head, come on, get in!

492
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:13,909
As I tired!

493
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,080
Come on, get in.

494
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,310
A second. This is my car.

495
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,360
What the hell are you doing in my car?

496
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:28,794
Is this your car? I didn't know that.

497
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:32,040
Wow! What's true is your ride?

498
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,680
Yes! That's my car!

499
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:36,240
Okay, okay. You're driving.

500
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:50,160
Remember I said that all cars are the 
same.

501
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,878
Now you know what I mean?!

502
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:55,040
Junior, stay away from my car.

503
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,040
Don't worry.

504
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:58,440
One guy says he saw Jimmy.

505
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:00,960
Normal people don't roam the streets 
at this hour.

506
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,760
At work we still do not go.

507
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,560
Fuck that, tell him the truth.

508
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:05,840
We just drove around and suddenly we 
see...

509
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:06,840
On my car.

510
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:08,360
A pure misunderstanding.

511
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:10,040
...so we went and met Colonel Ron!

512
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,712
Stopped to talk to him.

513
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Who's this Colonel Ron?

514
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,840
One local man. He served in Vietnam.

515
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:15,840
The Colonel?

516
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:19,879
In fact, he's a psycho, but he said 
that he saw Jimmy.

517
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:21,635
When he saw him?

518
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:24,680
I don't know... I had to ask.

519
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,680
You can trust him?

520
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,160
Though he is crazy, but not lying.

521
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,160
Yes, he's not.

522
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,115
Let's go talk to him.

523
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,349
Keys maybe you have.

524
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:39,515
And here is handsome.

525
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,155
Get In The MAG!

526
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,751
E! Little Magician is not lost!

527
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,756
This is it, Colonel Ron.

528
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,679
Is he fishing?

529
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,389
He's a geezer.

530
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,280
And he saw Jimmy?

531
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,235
Said.

532
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,479
How are you doing, Colonel Ron!

533
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,720
Fishing without permission.

534
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:47,675
He's a psycho.

535
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:53,630
And it's safe here? Anyone in the 
area.

536
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,668
What could be safer?

537
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,160
Well, soldier, let's get 50!

538
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,160
I beg your pardon?

539
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:01,880
A discussion of the orders of a 
superior officer, improper

540
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:04,553
posture, no shape, bad breath!

541
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:07,760
My breath smells?

542
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:08,715
Is not the word!

543
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:13,389
OK, screw push-UPS. Go brush your 
teeth, that's an order soldier!

544
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:16,280
Colonel Ron, we wanted to talk about 
Jimmy.

545
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:17,280
And who are you?

546
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,640
- Joe's Head.
- Joe's Head, sir!

547
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,392
You can call me Joe.

548
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,238
Come quickly and give me 50, private!

549
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,069
I also have breath?

550
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:28,398
Colonel Ron, can I ask you a few 
questions about Jimmy?

551
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,109
Bring it on, stinky!

552
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,800
Where exactly did you see Jimmy today?

553
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,199
Who's asking the questions here?

554
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:36,595
I thought I was.

555
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,353
Keep it up, Mr. stench.

556
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:42,000
You say that you saw today, Jimmy.

557
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
True.

558
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Where did you see it?

559
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,558
- In the water.
- In the water?

560
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:48,920
And who are you?

561
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,148
You know me, I , Jr.!

562
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,680
A residence permit there?

563
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,680
I am a citizen.

564
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:53,680
And a library card?

565
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:54,680
No.

566
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:57,000
In this case, you're an idiot. 
Continue with questions.

567
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,800
Colonel Ron, do you mind if I turn on 
the camera?

568
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,080
You work for the Pentagon?

569
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:02,080
No.

570
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,320
Then why waste my time?

571
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:04,594
It does not take much time.

572
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:05,920
You Mike Wallace?

573
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:06,920
No.

574
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:10,879
William Scott? Connie Chung? Pat 
Sajak, Arsenio Hall?

575
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:12,715
No.

576
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,352
Okay, buddy,

577
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:19,235
turn on your camera.

578
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:22,993
So, you say you saw Jimmy in the 
water.

579
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,120
Colonel Ron. local psychopath

580
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,075
True.

581
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,480
He swam?

582
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,760
The answer is no.

583
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:32,000
You lose $ 100, and we move on to the 
next player.

584
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,319
You say that you saw it in the water.

585
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:37,434
I saw in the water reflection. In 
fact, he was behind me.

586
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,000
You said something?

587
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,390
He just asked when the next lunar 
Eclipse.

588
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:44,274
Something not like him.

589
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:46,040
Actually he has a lower voice.

590
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,440
That's not what I meant...

591
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,440
Read better book!

592
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:50,400
He's still on the brain I will drip!

593
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,595
To drip on the brain?! To drip on the 
brain?!

594
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,560
What is this expression?

595
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,520
He says, you put it crudely.

596
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:00,671
I put it crudely?

597
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,998
He's the Pope or the employee filling?

598
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:07,710
I think this rodent was played 
megalomania.

599
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:09,720
It is quite possible.

600
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:10,675
What did he say?

601
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:14,760
Back to Jimmy. His behavior was 
anything unusual?

602
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:16,990
It has something to do with me 
dripping on the brain?

603
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,195
No.

604
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:21,238
Just asking. Come on, stinks on!

605
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:27,360
He was aware of where is where?

606
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:30,160
He said he goes to the store and I 
asked to buy me a sandwich.

607
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:32,913
It was a few hours ago.

608
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,873
That is, he was going to come back?

609
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:38,554
You are surrounded with the finest 
shit.

610
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:43,474
Yes, Einstein, he said he'll be back.

611
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,309
Do not worry, he is rude to me.

612
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,435
Hey, there he is!

613
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,032
Jimmy, what took you so long?!

614
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:59,630
It's not Jimmy..

615
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:02,674
It's not him. You said that you saw 
him.

616
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,468
It's not the..

617
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:08,440
The names I don't know. You asked me 
if I one-armed Jimmy.

618
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:13,080
No! I asked about the one-eyed Jimmy. 
Jimmy.! One-eyed!

619
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:14,399
I one-armed Jimmy.

620
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,155
Nice to meet you.

621
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:19,989
Brought my sandwich, Jimmy?

622
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:22,320
I told you not to listen to this 
nerds.

623
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,709
Nerds? Who you calling nerds?

624
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,760
If I hadn't shot a member in Vietnam

625
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,273
I would now be pissed at you.

626
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:30,560
If you don't shot a member in Vietnam

627
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:32,471
I'd have it ripped out and shoved up 
your ass!

628
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:40,397
Hey, come back here and defend 
yourself like a man, you filthy 
bastard!

629
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,038
At the chink and it was more courage!

630
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:53,318
Brush your teeth, buddy! Clean!

631
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:04,112
When you say missing this man?

632
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,229
About 4, 5 days ago.

633
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,400
Who is that?

634
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,355
This is Mr. Magoo.

635
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:14,031
Free, Mr. Magoo! And sticking with 
this thing.

636
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,120
He speaks English?

637
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:17,120
Detective Muldoon. local nerd.

638
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:20,669
Get out! Get out of here before the 
whole!

639
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:29,914
So, is your friend. When he was gone?

640
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,960
Like I said 4 or 5 days ago.

641
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:32,915
Your name?

642
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,240
My name?

643
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,514
Yes, who are you?

644
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:37,440
I - Donald.

645
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,919
- Donald? <u> Yes.

646
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:50,435
What else, Donald?

647
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,555
Donald Trump.

648
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,040
Donald Trump.

649
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:55,995
True.

650
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:57,794
Do you live nearby?

651
00:32:58,560 --> 00:32:59,515
In the center.

652
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:01,720
Where exactly?

653
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:07,400
On the 5th Avenue. The corner of 
57th. Tall gold building, you know?!

654
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,628
You about trump tower?

655
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,154
Yes, exactly. Where I live.

656
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:15,800
I'm sorry, Donald, you have a minute?

657
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:16,755
Of course.

658
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,160
What's going on?

659
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:29,233
I'm risking by being here. I'm not 
allowed to give themselves.

660
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,560
It's your picture on the wall.

661
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:36,000
No, no, this is my cousin. We are 
like him. Dude, all wrong.

662
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,240
With today's technology it is

663
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:40,435
easy to catch and imprison anyone.

664
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:45,600
And free people like I have to fight 
for their future.

665
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:46,555
And it's true.

666
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:54,360
Now check the computer, maybe 
something will show up.

667
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:56,640
But I must say, the chances are small,

668
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,835
especially if he does not want to be 
found.

669
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,515
This is the case?

670
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:04,751
How do I know! Just giving you all 
possible options.

671
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,040
Well, thanks for the help.

672
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,040
Not worth it.

673
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:09,040
Good luck, chief.

674
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:09,995
All the best, Donald.

675
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:11,669
Thanks for the help.

676
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:29,119
Hey, take a picture with Hanko 
Harrigton! A real man!

677
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,120
Champion!

678
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:32,075
Hi, Ed.

679
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:34,240
Hi guys. Head, how are you?

680
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:35,195
How are you?

681
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:38,194
Les, right?

682
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:40,795
How's it going?

683
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:43,040
Hi, Lefty.

684
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,268
Ed, how are you?

685
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:47,560
Hank...something unimportant.

686
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:49,437
Probably, it was necessary to by 
spike Lee.

687
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:52,838
I like this Shorty. So funny.

688
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:54,315
No news?

689
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:56,034
No,

690
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:57,640
all is quiet.

691
00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:02,668
Do not worry, soon everything will be 
fine. I can feel it.

692
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:06,640
Hope. And then the mother's going 
crazy. And my old man,

693
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:09,916
he actually had a strange reaction to 
bad news.

694
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:10,955
What?

695
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:12,480
What?

696
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,993
I mean reaction.

697
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:15,840
Well, he has...

698
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:23,758
Whenever he gets nervous, he stands 
up.

699
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:31,640
This by itself turns out. Someone in 
the chest

700
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:34,712
aches, someone has a migraine, my old 
man boner.

701
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:36,195
And what does he do?

702
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:39,434
Chasing mother around the house. 
She's angry...

703
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:42,320
What a family you have, ed!

704
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,275
Yeah.

705
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,629
What's that?

706
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:50,753
A familiar car.

707
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:03,400
Family.: Jimmy with me. If you want it

708
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:07,439
to see alive, put in a bag of $ 
10,000.

709
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,235
Is that all?

710
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:11,520
What means all this? 10000 is a lot 
of money.

711
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,360
I don't think it's worth it.

712
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:15,510
What to do with the money? It doesn't 
say what to take.

713
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,512
You're not familiar with this machine?

714
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:30,792
Leave the bag under the 3rd tank on 
the old...

715
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:33,080
- Refining...
- Refining plant.

716
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:36,231
Money needs to be in place at 10 PM...

717
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:39,480
If you notice you somewhere publi...

718
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:40,480
Nearby...

719
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,630
...nearby, the deal is off.

720
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:47,796
How do we know that's true?

721
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:51,995
Lord!

722
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:02,558
It looks like a glass eye Jimmy.

723
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:05,111
It's more like a toy ball.

724
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,798
Glass eyes toy-like balls.

725
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:10,156
Really? I didn't know.

726
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,000
The color, however, is not the same.

727
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,228
And the color of Jimmy's eyes?

728
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:17,997
I don't know the urea-green.

729
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:19,872
Here is a little yellowish.

730
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:21,509
You think?!

731
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,560
What do you think, Les?

732
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:25,073
I think we should take this to the 
police.

733
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,636
Look, I don't want to bother with it.

734
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:32,189
It will take all day, and I found 
that things are not so hot.

735
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:37,157
Hey, ed, since we're here, I want to 
take a picture with Hank?

736
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,433
Well. $ 5.

737
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,235
No discount?

738
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:44,515
Okay, 4 bucks.

739
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:46,909
And in debt?

740
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:49,158
What are you, dumb?

741
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:53,071
A small cash problem. Yeah, okay, ed, 
I promise, I'll pay.

742
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,114
Come on, get up.

743
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:08,480
Careful, careful.

744
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:09,435
Well.

745
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:14,320
Look, I know what my son's eyes.

746
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,275
This clearly belongs to Jimmy.

747
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:20,320
Mom, don't know the colour, some not 
so.

748
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:23,720
And then the color, stupid! I'm 
telling you, it's

749
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:27,120
Jimmy's eyes. You talk about color...

750
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:28,394
Well. Well.

751
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:32,273
To help better folded.

752
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,920
Why are you here doing Laundry?

753
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:38,310
Elevator in the building broke, and I 
can't go down to the basement.

754
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:41,399
Mrs., you have a stain on the shorts.

755
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,275
Where?

756
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:46,555
Right in the center.

757
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:51,028
Ah, Yes. Stains.

758
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:54,791
Try the ginger lemonade. I have 
stains.

759
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:01,397
How do we take the 10 Grand?

760
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,600
Don't look at me. I nettacki money.

761
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:07,800
Me too. Besides, we have no 
guarantees.

762
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:10,951
It is possible we will not be able to 
return the money.

763
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:13,395
Money down the drain.

764
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,040
What did you say?

765
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:15,995
Nothing.

766
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:19,032
You may have to contact Keith.

767
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,914
! I so owed him for the business.

768
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:24,275
Who is Keith?

769
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,313
He's a local Rockefeller.

770
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:30,789
Go talk to him. If need be, pawn your 
business.

771
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:33,840
To lay my business?! Mom, are you

772
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:36,000
it's not fair! I've just started.

773
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,278
We are talking about your brother! Go 
and talk to this whale!

774
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:42,469
Okay, I will.

775
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:44,229
Now!

776
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,760
Hi, Keith.

777
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:03,280
Listen, don't call me no more Keith. 
I spent 6 months

778
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:07,717
in the Bahamas, has lost 100 pounds. 
Now I'm a Snake.

779
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,280
Understand?!

780
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,872
Understood. Looking good.

781
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:13,715
What's the matter?

782
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:17,915
Look at this.

783
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:24,073
I didn't write.

784
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:27,600
No, no, Keith, that is a Snake, I'm 
not saying you wrote it.

785
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:30,717
It threw out of the car. They say 
that they have my brother.

786
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:32,040
Which brother?

787
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:33,040
My brother Jimmy.

788
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:34,040
The one with the eye?

789
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:36,040
<u> Yes. <u> Bum fucking.</u>

790
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:37,040
Know.

791
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:39,508
Want to pay for it 10 Grand?

792
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:41,553
The mother is going through.

793
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:45,277
I know him all my life, you fucking 
loser.

794
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:48,354
He eyes and then lost when his mouth 
took.

795
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:50,435
I didn't know that.

796
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:54,911
The way it was. She's out there 
trying, and eyes.

797
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,520
Maybe you should talk to my mother,

798
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:02,158
convince her that it's a waste of 
money.

799
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:05,075
You can't say this. It's her son.

800
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,040
Yes, you're right.

801
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:10,271
Is there proof that they got it?

802
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:12,549
They sent this.

803
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:17,440
This is what his eyes?

804
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:18,440
Well, Yes.

805
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:19,440
Like a toy ball.

806
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:21,476
Glass eyes toy-like balls.

807
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:23,195
Who are you?

808
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:24,715
Joe Gladden.

809
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:26,360
Son, Frankie Heads?

810
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:27,315
Exactly.

811
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:29,039
The grandson of Vinnie's head, right?

812
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:32,075
Wow!

813
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:33,640
What's your head size?

814
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:35,280
I do not know.

815
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:37,191
Probably the 13th.

816
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:40,000
How do you think, Keith, you're not...

817
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:40,955
Snake!

818
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:44,356
I'm sorry. Snake. You lend him money?

819
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:49,200
Borrow. Why not.

820
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:54,040
You wait here. Guard the entrance.

821
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:54,995
Okay.

822
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:57,716
Of course. Thank you.

823
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:19,520
Want 10 thousand? Will return 15.

824
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:21,000
Not a lot?

825
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,149
And who are you?

826
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:25,474
It Les.

827
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:27,638
He makes a film.

828
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:29,588
You're making a movie, mate?

829
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:32,715
Come on, turn the camera and take 
this.

830
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:38,588
- Ready? <u> Yes.

831
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:40,520
A shot of some of this:

832
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:41,680
Snake. local people-Sberbank

833
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:44,990
Know what it is? This is my out of 
pocket expenses.

834
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:49,515
This tutu is fun, and that
- for a snack.

835
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:52,111
And this bundle for business.

836
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:57,079
Going to teach me the business? I 
don't think so, buddy.

837
00:42:57,600 --> 00:43:00,114
The snake does not tolerate tips.

838
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:02,839
You're right, Snake.

839
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:05,791
So, what do you want?

840
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:08,640
Want to pay the ransom, hoping to 
return a klutz?

841
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:10,949
Or forget the whole thing?

842
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:14,280
What was it?

843
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:15,235
Lunch.

844
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:18,280
I'll take the money.

845
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:19,793
You can't have any.

846
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:24,991
First Snake read the rules.

847
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:28,600
Joe, how are you?

848
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:29,794
Junior!

849
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:31,640
What's new?

850
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:34,120
Ed inside with Keith. Discussing 
something.

851
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:36,880
What are you doing here, guard?

852
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:38,199
Well, Yes. Guard.

853
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:43,400
By the way, Keith no longer wants to 
be a whale.

854
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:46,600
Now he is a Snake. He dropped 100 
pounds in the Bahamas.

855
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:49,320
Really? The may also be doing this.

856
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:50,594
Pull the figure, in a sense.

857
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:52,360
I'm broke.

858
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:54,715
Don't worry, I'll help.

859
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:58,360
I have connections, man. My uncle 
Pepe works for the airlines.

860
00:43:58,360 --> 00:43:59,360
Okay.

861
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:01,600
Decide to use an alternative plan, 
will

862
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:03,795
to pay 500 bucks a week over 30 weeks.

863
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:06,790
Rate may be increased.

864
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:11,712
Will produce 10 pieces, I'll cut 5 
hundred. Understand?

865
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:15,955
Turn off the camera!

866
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:24,480
By the way, long time since your 
father saw. Is it still working?

867
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:25,993
He was on sick leave.

868
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:27,789
- The same thing again? <u> Yes.

869
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:29,309
Your poor mother.

870
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:33,113
Thank You, Kee...Snake.

871
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:34,155
Yes, Yes.

872
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:44,320
Understand?

873
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:45,600
Yes. It's all good.

874
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:46,555
Well.

875
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:48,109
Hey, Snake, how's it going!

876
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:49,995
Who are you?

877
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:51,400
Jr.

878
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:53,516
Junior? Who's your father?

879
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:54,800
Jr.

880
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:55,800
Your father was Jr.?

881
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:56,800
Well, Yes.

882
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:58,233
- Junior to senior? <u> True.

883
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:00,197
- And you're the Youngest Junior? <u> 
Exactly!

884
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:02,040
What's the name?

885
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:02,995
Like that.

886
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,080
Bloody hell!

887
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:09,036
My family is from the Dominican 
Republic.

888
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:10,515
Who cares.

889
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:13,280
How's your business?

890
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:16,716
Well. Hank, the truth, things are bad.

891
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:18,439
That's because he's a faggot.

892
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:26,835
He's a good guy.

893
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:55,038
Act here's how: take a bag, come to 
Baku

894
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:59,992
leave the bag and go. Understand?

895
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:02,075
Understood.

896
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:04,193
I think they have a Jimmy with you?

897
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:07,151
I look like a genius?

898
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:09,193
I'm an employee.

899
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:12,635
Forward.

900
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:31,552
Now it remains to be seen.

901
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:33,474
Exactly, Mr. Holmes.

902
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:36,034
On my 10:02.

903
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:38,480
On my same.

904
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:39,674
- Shut up. <u> Okay.

905
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:43,715
Am I too late?

906
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:45,680
For one minute.

907
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:46,908
Great, man!

908
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:49,000
We saw each other an hour ago.

909
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:49,955
Yeah, I know.

910
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:52,080
We were supposed to meet on the 
Boulevard.

911
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:53,720
You know, I'm sorry. I had to take

912
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:55,312
the grandmother of the guests; she 
didn't want to leave.

913
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:09,949
This might be our chance.

914
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:12,160
What do we do?

915
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:13,388
Wait.

916
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:18,354
I just like Rambo! Incredible!

917
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:37,915
Quiet.

918
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:01,515
Get him!

919
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:13,760
I didn't do anything! This is a 
misunderstanding!

920
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:14,715
Quietly, calmly.

921
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:16,360
I'm not to blame!

922
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:17,840
Don't fight it. Peace!

923
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:19,319
This is a misunderstanding!

924
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:21,075
Damn! It's Junior!

925
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:23,920
I can explain everything. I can 
explain everything!

926
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:25,040
I knew that it was you!

927
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:26,720
No you didn't, you fool!

928
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:28,160
Junior, how could you?

929
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:29,878
Simply so there were circumstances.

930
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:32,200
Newspapers are writing about this.

931
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:33,840
Lately my nerves to hell

932
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:35,520
especially after the broken glasses.

933
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:37,158
In me as if something broke.

934
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:39,512
What the hell are you talking about?

935
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:42,040
You still owe me 37.50.

936
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:43,792
The store refused to fix my glasses.

937
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:47,640
It's not real money.

938
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:48,595
Where is the money?

939
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,319
I didn't take anything.

940
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:56,600
I have the money at home under the 
bed. Wait a second, where's Jimmy?

941
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:58,160
I don't know. I didn't steal it.

942
00:48:58,160 --> 00:48:59,115
What about the eyes?

943
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:03,799
It's a toy. I cut out the dolls. Doll 
my niece.

944
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:07,320
I couldn't even imagine what you

945
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:09,440
capable of this, Junior! Mother will 
be furious!

946
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:12,716
And your father will still suffer 
with an uncontrollable erection.

947
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:16,680
Tell them that I'm sorry. I 
personally will ask

948
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:18,830
apologize as soon as everything 
settled down.

949
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:22,753
Yeah, in twenty years.

950
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:24,155
Twenty years?

951
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:30,033
You'll sue me in court? What are you, 
it's me, Junior!

952
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:32,360
<u> Hey!</u>
- Let's go. Move.

953
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:35,033
We're with you for so many years 
familiar! I didn't mean anything!

954
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:39,636
It was just a joke! Just kidding!

955
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:41,800
Hey, Lefty, who are you waving at, 
miserable dwarf!

956
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:43,631
As to the house going to get?

957
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:46,758
Where is your car? Huh?!

958
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:51,640
Damn. Again stole my car.

959
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:54,440
Hey, Les, you better cut all this 
from your film.

960
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:57,240
My uncle Pepe is a lawyer! I'll sue 
you!

961
00:49:57,240 --> 00:50:00,240
What are you looking at Head? Virgin 
fucking. I have

962
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:03,152
prison will be more Chicks than you 
can imagine!

963
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:06,078
I will be back!

964
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:07,835
Well,

965
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:10,788
will have to start all over again.

966
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,434
I can't believe that Junior is 
capable of that.

967
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:45,271
I mean the ransom note to prove it 
and everything.

968
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:47,318
About the people difficult to judge.

969
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:53,792
And what will happen with your movie? 
You're taking it back to California?

970
00:50:54,120 --> 00:50:57,157
I'll take him back, do the 
installation work, see what happens.

971
00:50:57,840 --> 00:51:01,116
Let's hope the right people they will 
be interested.

972
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:05,440
Yeah. You don't want the crowds of 
the elderly. They pay

973
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:08,796
just a couple of bucks per session. 
So not make any money.

974
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:11,714
That's not what I meant.

975
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:13,195
You know

976
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:16,118
maybe they'll never find Jimmy.

977
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:18,715
Possible.

978
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:21,195
Where Lefty?

979
00:51:22,560 --> 00:51:25,920
He is looking for his wheelbarrow 
across the County.

980
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:28,593
Trying to figure out where Younger it 
might have got.

981
00:51:29,560 --> 00:51:30,515
And here he is.

982
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:32,909
Probably not found.

983
00:51:37,120 --> 00:51:38,109
I looked everywhere:

984
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:42,310
the channel, store on Union Street;

985
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:44,400
Don't know where she is.

986
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:45,674
Where you left the last time?

987
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:47,080
Next to the house.

988
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:48,035
There looked?

989
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:53,800
Are you saying that after he stole my 
car,

990
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:55,480
he put it on the same place?

991
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:57,118
If he's such a considerate thief?

992
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:01,114
Just some kind of attack

993
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:05,151
Don't say anything. I have a 
restraining order.

994
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:07,671
Junior, why are you not in jail?

995
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:12,393
Ed decided not to sue. Talked father 
Julio.

996
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:14,200
To kill you a little.

997
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:17,397
Stay away! Don't. The law is on my 
side.

998
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:19,680
I just wanted to give you back your 
car.

999
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:21,238
I want to start with a clean slate.

1000
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:26,320
Around here baby!

1001
00:52:26,320 --> 00:52:28,709
We stopped for lunch, the father 
hungry.

1002
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:31,872
Double cheeseburger, fries, a cherry 
pie.

1003
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:35,511
From this day on I dedicate myself to 
God. From now on I am his servant.

1004
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:37,789
What is that nonsense?

1005
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:40,795
Junior saw the light!

1006
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:43,117
Junior can't see anything without 
glasses.

1007
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:46,600
Glasses I no longer need.

1008
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:48,960
I bought contact lenses. They paint 
me.

1009
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:50,680
Nothing paint.

1010
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:54,400
Refuse to argue with you, my friend. 
You have to be above that.

1011
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:56,118
Someone protyagivaetsya a helping 
hand, Junior.

1012
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:59,354
True. This is the Holy father.

1013
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:03,200
We have to go, Junior. To work.

1014
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:04,155
You are right, father.

1015
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:07,228
See you later, Amigos! Yes you will 
arrive with the world!

1016
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:09,315
VAIO con Dios!

1017
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:10,920
Good luck with the film, Mr. Les!

1018
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:12,558
<u> Thank You, Junior. <u> The Next 
Steven Spielberg!</u>

1019
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:14,760
Nice to meet you, father.

1020
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:15,760
Behave yourself, my son.

1021
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:16,715
Try.

1022
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:12,951
Hello, Mrs.. How do you do?

1023
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:14,989
Not really.

1024
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:16,760
No news?

1025
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:18,159
No. Silence.

1026
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:19,800
I'm really sorry.

1027
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:23,475
Thank you. My husband was going 
through so much.

1028
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:28,560
Want to talk to a clairvoyant, she 
could help.

1029
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:31,760
Don't know what to do. I'm going 
crazy.

1030
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:32,715
Still.

1031
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:35,280
The boys will help me with the 
leaflets?

1032
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:36,235
Of course.

1033
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:43,556
I can't... as soon as I see the face 
of his Jimmy, I...

1034
00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:56,200
I have to go.

1035
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:57,155
We'll get you set up.

1036
00:54:57,920 --> 00:54:59,480
No, not worth it.

1037
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:01,240
It's not too much trouble, right?

1038
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:02,195
Of course.

1039
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:03,680
Madam Esther. Predictions.

1040
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:05,193
I always thought it was a brothel.

1041
00:55:12,680 --> 00:55:13,874
Please, have a seat.

1042
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:18,195
Have a seat.

1043
00:55:19,560 --> 00:55:20,515
Sit down.

1044
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:25,310
Do any of you problems? Please.

1045
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:27,155
I have.

1046
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:30,829
Will pay now or later?

1047
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:34,713
How much will it cost?

1048
00:55:35,560 --> 00:55:38,950
Looking for a miracle wish. It is 
difficult to assess.

1049
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:41,351
Do you have a price list?

1050
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:43,879
And you have to do something?

1051
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:45,474
I'm just a friend.

1052
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:48,029
Friend

1053
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:53,554
sit tight. I need to concentrate.

1054
00:55:55,160 --> 00:55:56,115
No problem.

1055
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:58,955
Where were we?

1056
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:02,400
My son disappeared.

1057
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:03,400
Your son went missing.

1058
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:04,355
Yes.

1059
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:07,274
Will pay now or later?

1060
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:09,400
How much will it cost?

1061
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:10,719
With bleach or without?

1062
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:12,475
Excuse me?!

1063
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:17,113
This is my secondary business.

1064
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:29,959
You say you have lost a son.

1065
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:31,799
<u> True.</u>
- Where is he?

1066
00:56:34,520 --> 00:56:36,640
I don't know. So here I am.

1067
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:38,312
Well, of course.

1068
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,228
This is my son.

1069
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:46,189
A very nice boy.

1070
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:52,234
$ 20, please.

1071
00:56:53,120 --> 00:56:55,120
For $ 20 you will find my son?

1072
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:56,439
I'll try.

1073
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:07,597
Your life line is very...

1074
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:11,200
wait a second, your life line is very 
dry, very dry.

1075
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:14,040
Want to recommend a hand cream?

1076
00:57:14,040 --> 00:57:16,759
What can you say about my son?

1077
00:57:17,720 --> 00:57:18,914
Yes, of course. I don't need.

1078
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:24,631
Select three cards. I don't show them.

1079
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:28,555
Card's marked.

1080
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:38,393
Chose, well. Now, put them back in 
the deck.

1081
00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:41,275
Very good.

1082
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:01,840
That's my card!

1083
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:02,829
Of course.

1084
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:05,797
I think you are dealing with an 
Amateur?

1085
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:15,440
Your son will be.

1086
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:20,389
My God, isn't it? Thank God! Lord!

1087
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:24,795
He's out there somewhere.

1088
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:31,197
Where? Where is he? Where? Where's my 
Jimmy? Incredible! Oh, my God!

1089
00:58:33,240 --> 00:58:34,673
You know where's Jimmy?

1090
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:39,309
Can't say for sure. He's out there 
somewhere, that's all I know.

1091
00:58:39,640 --> 00:58:42,359
Where do we look for? Can you give 
some hint?

1092
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:45,000
Madame does not give hints.

1093
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:45,955
The map?

1094
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:49,792
Continue in the same spirit. In the 
end everything will pay off.

1095
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:54,000
- Thank you! Thank you! <u> Yes, Yes.

1096
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,000
Oh, God bless you!

1097
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:56,400
Okay, okay.

1098
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:57,958
Thank you! God bless you!

1099
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:02,680
God bless you!

1100
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:03,635
Of course, of course.

1101
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:12,235
We will arrange for Jimmy's party! 
All invited.

1102
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:14,080
Maybe better to wait for his return?

1103
00:59:14,080 --> 00:59:18,000
No! No! He will be forced to return.

1104
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:21,920
We look forward to the return of 
Jimmy.

1105
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:26,000
Sure! We all get together and 
celebrate! And he will enter the room,

1106
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:30,120
and bodythe feels as if he never left.

1107
00:59:30,120 --> 00:59:31,440
Are you sure you want to throw a 
party?

1108
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:33,635
Yes, Yes! We have to do it!

1109
00:59:34,040 --> 00:59:37,715
Well, I ran! All you need to cook!

1110
00:59:40,040 --> 00:59:41,598
Spread the word!

1111
00:59:42,040 --> 00:59:43,234
Today we have a home!

1112
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:45,279
Tell everyone!

1113
00:59:57,360 --> 00:59:58,793
Maybe eat before you go?

1114
01:00:01,840 --> 01:00:03,353
What is the question?

1115
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:06,956
If you are hungry, eat.

1116
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:09,351
If you are not hungry, don't eat.

1117
01:00:10,320 --> 01:00:11,320
What's the problem?

1118
01:00:11,320 --> 01:00:12,275
There is no problem.

1119
01:00:12,800 --> 01:00:14,438
You ask the strangest questions.

1120
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:17,840
Don't be mad. This is not the case.

1121
01:00:17,840 --> 01:00:18,795
I'm not mad.

1122
01:00:19,840 --> 01:00:20,795
Well.

1123
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:23,320
Do you think that there will be food?

1124
01:00:23,320 --> 01:00:24,275
I do not know.

1125
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:25,955
Let me guess.

1126
01:00:26,520 --> 01:00:27,475
Come on.

1127
01:00:28,280 --> 01:00:29,280
What?

1128
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:30,759
What do you think?

1129
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:33,640
Chicken.

1130
01:00:33,640 --> 01:00:35,000
Good guess.

1131
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:36,000
Think?

1132
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:37,000
Yes.

1133
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:37,955
I think they will have chicken?

1134
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:42,034
I do not know. Just saying it's a 
good guess.

1135
01:00:46,040 --> 01:00:47,439
I think you know something.

1136
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:50,436
- What do I know? <u> That is not a 
chicken.

1137
01:00:51,360 --> 01:00:52,840
How do I know that they will have on 
the table?

1138
01:00:52,840 --> 01:00:54,319
She just decided on the party.

1139
01:00:55,560 --> 01:00:56,515
Enough about that.

1140
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:00,840
<u> And another...</u>
- What?

1141
01:01:00,840 --> 01:01:02,040
I take back my guess.

1142
01:01:02,040 --> 01:01:02,995
<u> For all I care. <u> "Ready?"</u>

1143
01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:05,873
<u> Come on.</u>
- Fish.

1144
01:01:06,560 --> 01:01:07,560
Let it be fish.

1145
01:01:07,560 --> 01:01:08,879
<u> Will the fish?</u>
- Shut up.

1146
01:01:15,360 --> 01:01:16,360
What's the matter, Joe?

1147
01:01:16,360 --> 01:01:17,315
I'm starving.

1148
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:25,069
You need to step...

1149
01:01:26,320 --> 01:01:27,594
Take a photo of me and Hank!

1150
01:01:28,520 --> 01:01:30,078
Beat it, don't forget to pay this 
time.

1151
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:32,158
Hey, Joe, got my 4 bucks?

1152
01:01:33,080 --> 01:01:34,035
Son of a bitch.

1153
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:36,200
Hello, Joe! Take off your clothes.

1154
01:01:36,200 --> 01:01:37,200
Hello, Mrs..

1155
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:38,155
Hello, dear!

1156
01:01:41,640 --> 01:01:43,278
Well throw out this crap!

1157
01:01:43,720 --> 01:01:44,675
Sorry.

1158
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:47,115
I wish you health!

1159
01:01:48,920 --> 01:01:49,875
At ease.

1160
01:02:07,600 --> 01:02:09,320
Don't know exactly, but I said,

1161
01:02:09,320 --> 01:02:11,080
Jimmy returns home!

1162
01:02:11,080 --> 01:02:13,840
Jimmy returns home!

1163
01:02:13,840 --> 01:02:17,549
One, two, three, four, five...

1164
01:02:20,760 --> 01:02:24,320
Jimmy will be home soon! Hooray, 
Hooray!

1165
01:02:24,320 --> 01:02:25,958
Hey, stop that!

1166
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:31,109
Well, the company gathered!

1167
01:02:33,040 --> 01:02:35,634
Bet three to one that the imbecile 
does not appear.

1168
01:02:36,040 --> 01:02:37,029
A hundred bucks.

1169
01:02:37,400 --> 01:02:38,355
You're in the game.

1170
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:43,476
Uncle, is that you? You look great! 
What you do with them?

1171
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:49,040
My favorite nephew. I know the folks?

1172
01:02:49,040 --> 01:02:50,320
Of course.

1173
01:02:50,320 --> 01:02:51,560
It's Bobby Head, you know?

1174
01:02:51,560 --> 01:02:52,920
Of course. How do you do, Bobby!

1175
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:53,875
Joe.

1176
01:02:54,640 --> 01:02:55,800
Photo with Hank?

1177
01:02:55,800 --> 01:02:56,800
Come on!

1178
01:02:56,800 --> 01:02:57,755
$ 5.

1179
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:05,480
Grenades have?

1180
01:03:05,480 --> 01:03:09,189
Of course, but there's something even 
more abruptly! I have a dynamite.

1181
01:03:10,280 --> 01:03:12,111
Dynamite?! Cool, huh!

1182
01:03:12,680 --> 01:03:13,635
Take a couple.

1183
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:15,319
Why do you have dynamite?

1184
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:19,316
From the roof to throw. Jehovah's 
witnesses in his pants impose.

1185
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:22,313
I'd like to see this!

1186
01:03:23,320 --> 01:03:24,275
Well.

1187
01:03:28,160 --> 01:03:29,673
Oh, damn, ran out of tape.

1188
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:30,840
Come back tomorrow.

1189
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:32,239
And my money?!

1190
01:03:34,320 --> 01:03:35,275
Hi!

1191
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:37,349
What's new?!

1192
01:03:39,240 --> 01:03:40,593
Damn!

1193
01:03:42,560 --> 01:03:43,515
Well all.

1194
01:03:57,080 --> 01:03:58,229
Show him, father.

1195
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:07,799
Well, this is war!

1196
01:04:08,320 --> 01:04:09,514
You can't treat the Lord!

1197
01:04:10,640 --> 01:04:11,640
How are you, father?

1198
01:04:11,640 --> 01:04:13,232
Hey, father, do not want to dance?

1199
01:04:14,840 --> 01:04:16,068
Welcome to the party!

1200
01:04:16,600 --> 01:04:19,480
Lefty may not have been so with her 
father?!

1201
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:24,320
No, he is not the father. I learned 
it all. Julio's younger cousin.

1202
01:04:24,320 --> 01:04:27,278
Working in the garage. It's all a 
masquerade.

1203
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:30,798
I can't believe he got you beat! Jerk!

1204
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:33,119
Well, hard you.

1205
01:04:40,200 --> 01:04:41,519
Thank you for coming, Padre.

1206
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:44,869
I'll see you later, father.

1207
01:05:07,120 --> 01:05:08,189
Look!

1208
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:18,635
How are you doing?!

1209
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:27,835
What happened?

1210
01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:30,560
It is still not to my taste.

1211
01:05:30,560 --> 01:05:31,675
Give up?

1212
01:05:32,920 --> 01:05:33,920
Yes.

1213
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:37,595
Come on, be a man! Say you want to 
dance with her.

1214
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:39,955
Huh?!

1215
01:05:40,840 --> 01:05:43,513
Otherwise, I'm going to tell.

1216
01:05:44,320 --> 01:05:45,840
He'll come running and will retire 
with

1217
01:05:45,840 --> 01:05:47,319
this beauty, the eye does not have 
time to blink!

1218
01:05:47,880 --> 01:05:51,200
No word grandfather. I have all the 
women beats.

1219
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:52,679
Well, come on!

1220
01:06:01,880 --> 01:06:03,040
Let's dance.

1221
01:06:03,040 --> 01:06:03,995
Fuck you.

1222
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:35,988
Joe's Head! Joe's Head! Joe's Head...

1223
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:06,955
Yay!

1224
01:07:21,400 --> 01:07:22,355
Wow!

1225
01:07:25,120 --> 01:07:26,519
Good Job Head!

1226
01:07:31,720 --> 01:07:33,995
Joe, that was incredible!

1227
01:07:34,560 --> 01:07:36,915
Thank you. I was on top.

1228
01:07:38,120 --> 01:07:39,120
Mom, look at my photos.

1229
01:07:39,120 --> 01:07:40,960
Give it to me! Give it to me! You owe 
me 5 bucks!

1230
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:43,554
Thank you all for coming.

1231
01:07:45,560 --> 01:07:49,360
The party is over! Please go away.

1232
01:07:49,360 --> 01:07:53,148
And we'll wait for Jimmy.

1233
01:07:56,400 --> 01:07:57,720
They blow it up...

1234
01:07:57,720 --> 01:07:58,948
Guys, guys...

1235
01:08:02,800 --> 01:08:03,755
Jerk!

1236
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:13,113
How you doing, Harold?

1237
01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:14,989
All the way through.

1238
01:08:23,360 --> 01:08:25,430
Don't know, I thought it would work.

1239
01:08:29,560 --> 01:08:30,709
Nice try, mom.

1240
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:33,515
Right on, mom.

1241
01:08:35,960 --> 01:08:37,791
Well, I gotta go.

1242
01:08:41,680 --> 01:08:42,635
Me too.

1243
01:08:44,680 --> 01:08:45,635
I'm going too.

1244
01:08:46,240 --> 01:08:49,277
Wait, I want to thank you all for 
your help.

1245
01:08:49,840 --> 01:08:51,520
I'm sorry that nothing came of it.

1246
01:08:51,520 --> 01:08:52,953
What can you do.

1247
01:08:54,320 --> 01:08:55,760
Ed, can I ask you a question?

1248
01:08:55,760 --> 01:08:56,760
Of course.

1249
01:08:56,760 --> 01:08:58,318
Remember today's chicken wings?

1250
01:08:58,400 --> 01:08:59,400
Well, Yes.

1251
01:08:59,400 --> 01:09:01,960
Where did you get them? In life, 
nothing like eating!

1252
01:09:01,960 --> 01:09:04,269
I do not know. Want me to ask mom?

1253
01:09:04,840 --> 01:09:06,273
I don't think now is the best time.

1254
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,200
Yes, of course. I'll call you 
tomorrow.

1255
01:09:10,200 --> 01:09:11,560
<u> Okay.</u>
- Thank you.

1256
01:09:11,560 --> 01:09:13,198
Well. Lefty.

1257
01:09:16,520 --> 01:09:18,720
And here he is! Jimmy, where were you?

1258
01:09:18,720 --> 01:09:21,240
Lord! Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy!

1259
01:09:21,240 --> 01:09:24,357
It worked! My son is back!

1260
01:09:25,240 --> 01:09:26,320
Jimmy!

1261
01:09:26,320 --> 01:09:27,840
How you doing, Jimmy?!

1262
01:09:27,840 --> 01:09:29,319
Oh, Jimmy!

1263
01:09:39,720 --> 01:09:43,793
Where have you been? I was so 
worried, couldn't find any!

1264
01:09:46,280 --> 01:09:47,235
Where was I?

1265
01:09:50,240 --> 01:09:53,391
Want to know where I was?

1266
01:09:54,680 --> 01:09:55,635
Yes.

1267
01:09:57,360 --> 01:09:58,315
Thank you.

1268
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:01,155
Can't acccess.

1269
01:10:06,360 --> 01:10:11,480
One-Eyed Jimmy. fucking parasite

1270
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:29,158
Now tell me where I was.

1271
01:10:31,200 --> 01:10:36,228
Five days ago, mom sent me to the 
basement...

1272
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:39,675
...do your Laundry, remember?

1273
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:46,788
While I was there, the Elevator broke 
down.

1274
01:10:47,560 --> 01:10:50,393
Yeah, it didn't work. What?

1275
01:10:51,200 --> 01:10:52,155
And then!

1276
01:10:58,080 --> 01:11:01,080
I decided to find out...

1277
01:11:01,080 --> 01:11:03,880
...on the surface.

1278
01:11:03,880 --> 01:11:04,915
So...

1279
01:11:06,240 --> 01:11:07,832
The exit was closed.

1280
01:11:09,080 --> 01:11:11,071
I knock on the door of the Manager,

1281
01:11:13,360 --> 01:11:15,078
and he, guess what...

1282
01:11:16,120 --> 01:11:18,320
He's been on vacation.

1283
01:11:18,320 --> 01:11:19,275
Exactly.

1284
01:11:20,080 --> 01:11:23,390
I had a basement for five days.

1285
01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:26,480
The Manager had just returned home.

1286
01:11:26,480 --> 01:11:31,480
Oh, my God! How did you survive? What 
did you eat?

1287
01:11:31,480 --> 01:11:33,436
Had to break into his apartment.

1288
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:42,794
And even his phone no.

1289
01:11:43,840 --> 01:11:45,353
I had no one to call.

1290
01:11:46,600 --> 01:11:50,593
Mommy, he doesn't have cable, I even 
the TV couldn't see.

1291
01:11:56,560 --> 01:11:59,996
The toilet is broken. Can you 
imagine?!

1292
01:12:01,200 --> 01:12:02,474
The toilet did not go down.

1293
01:12:05,640 --> 01:12:09,155
He even no beer. No beer!

1294
01:12:11,200 --> 01:12:12,235
Can you imagine?!

1295
01:12:13,960 --> 01:12:15,359
Lord! On, hold on.

1296
01:12:16,840 --> 01:12:17,795
Thank You, Eddie.

1297
01:12:39,360 --> 01:12:42,113
I had to eat cat food.

1298
01:12:44,160 --> 01:12:48,995
To sleep on a cot. I couldn't get out 
of here!

1299
01:12:53,480 --> 01:12:54,674
Incredible!

1300
01:12:56,280 --> 01:12:57,960
So whose cries could be heard from 
the basement!

1301
01:12:57,960 --> 01:12:59,075
What a douche.

1302
01:13:00,280 --> 01:13:03,160
I couldn't get out! I will never

1303
01:13:03,160 --> 01:13:05,958
do Laundry in the building!

1304
01:13:09,800 --> 01:13:10,755
You had a party?

1305
01:13:35,360 --> 01:13:36,713
Locked in the basement...

1306
01:13:37,680 --> 01:13:39,560
I would be crazy.

1307
01:13:39,560 --> 01:13:40,560
Exactly.

1308
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:43,996
Can't believe it! Well, the ending!

1309
01:13:44,840 --> 01:13:45,795
Huh?

1310
01:13:48,200 --> 01:13:50,316
Damn it! Asshole fucking!

1311
01:13:55,560 --> 01:13:57,596
In fact, they love each other.

1312
01:14:05,240 --> 01:14:06,229
What will you do now?

1313
01:14:07,640 --> 01:14:08,993
To sleep.

1314
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:11,671
And then?

1315
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:14,075
And then what?

1316
01:14:14,640 --> 01:14:15,914
Hanging out today not going?

1317
01:14:18,160 --> 01:14:19,115
To hang out?

1318
01:14:20,440 --> 01:14:23,680
After my probably the best the film 
flopped

1319
01:14:23,680 --> 01:14:26,797
the hell are you asking me to be 
hanging out today?

1320
01:14:27,680 --> 01:14:28,680
I don't...

1321
01:14:28,680 --> 01:14:31,120
Now what will happen to my film?

1322
01:14:31,120 --> 01:14:33,560
Victim is not victim.

1323
01:14:33,560 --> 01:14:35,949
He is trapped in the basement with a 
bunch of dirty Laundry.

1324
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:38,391
He a nerd?!

1325
01:15:00,680 --> 01:15:01,795
I thought you left.

1326
01:15:03,160 --> 01:15:04,752
This is about my whole career.

1327
01:15:08,400 --> 01:15:09,799
So you're not going to hang out today?

1328
01:15:10,640 --> 01:15:11,834
What do you want?

1329
01:15:12,680 --> 01:15:13,874
Maybe get something to eat?

1330
01:15:14,200 --> 01:15:15,394
We ate all night.

1331
01:15:15,920 --> 01:15:16,875
As you want to.

1332
01:15:20,360 --> 01:15:21,349
What do you want to eat?

1333
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:23,920
I do not know. What do you want?

1334
01:15:23,920 --> 01:15:24,875
Just say the word.

1335
01:15:25,480 --> 01:15:26,754
Why are you angry?

1336
01:15:29,960 --> 01:15:30,915
I'm not angry.

1337
01:15:32,280 --> 01:15:34,191
Okay, don't get angry.

1338
01:15:35,680 --> 01:15:36,749
Hang out later.

1339
01:15:37,800 --> 01:15:38,755
Well.

1340
01:15:40,240 --> 01:15:41,195
How much?

1341
01:15:42,240 --> 01:15:43,195
I'll call you.

1342
01:15:45,360 --> 01:15:46,315
As you want to.

1343
01:15:48,280 --> 01:15:49,395
Can a chicken eat?

1344
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:51,955
Come on.

1345
01:16:06,600 --> 01:16:08,360
I can't get out. Never again

1346
01:16:08,360 --> 01:16:10,120
I will not wash clothes in the 
building.

1347
01:16:10,120 --> 01:16:14,352
6 months later... the Hollywood.

1348
01:16:15,360 --> 01:16:17,080
Dirty and openly. I liked it.

1349
01:16:17,080 --> 01:16:18,080
I agree.

1350
01:16:18,080 --> 01:16:21,120
Excellent! Just perfect! These guys 
snowfolk in

1351
01:16:21,120 --> 01:16:24,160
cool shit! They've been through so 
much! Want to be with them.

1352
01:16:24,160 --> 01:16:26,760
Crude, but great. They managed

1353
01:16:26,760 --> 01:16:29,320
to capture the essence of our society.

1354
01:16:30,960 --> 01:16:32,552
The Heritage Of America.

1355
01:16:33,400 --> 01:16:38,120
Possession of rights. Do not show 
their delight. Close the deal.

1356
01:16:38,120 --> 01:16:39,120
Will be done.

1357
01:16:39,120 --> 01:16:41,560
I have to go. Meeting with Laker in 
twenty minutes.

1358
01:16:41,560 --> 01:16:43,949
Say Hello to Jack.

1359
01:16:49,960 --> 01:16:53,555
Ron Taski Vice President of the 
mergers.

1360
01:16:57,320 --> 01:16:58,275
Miranda

1361
01:16:58,840 --> 01:16:59,795
invite them.

1362
01:17:05,240 --> 01:17:06,560
Ron Taski. How do you do?

1363
01:17:06,560 --> 01:17:08,471
Mr. Taski, I'm a fan of your movies.

1364
01:17:10,760 --> 01:17:11,749
What would you like?

1365
01:17:12,440 --> 01:17:13,873
Chicken wings you have?

1366
01:17:14,640 --> 01:17:15,675
No.

1367
01:17:16,440 --> 01:17:17,440
What do you have?

1368
01:17:17,440 --> 01:17:19,560
Has Evian and Perrier.

1369
01:17:19,560 --> 01:17:20,754
Just water for me.

1370
01:17:21,880 --> 01:17:22,835
Me too.

1371
01:17:28,120 --> 01:17:29,120
Thank you.

1372
01:17:29,120 --> 01:17:31,800
First I want to say I really liked 
the movie.

1373
01:17:31,800 --> 01:17:34,439
You managed to capture the essence of 
our society.

1374
01:17:35,480 --> 01:17:36,480
The gist of it?

1375
01:17:36,480 --> 01:17:37,480
Well, Yes.

1376
01:17:37,480 --> 01:17:39,360
Before proceeding to the discussion

1377
01:17:39,360 --> 01:17:41,191
tell me who owns the rights to the 
film?

1378
01:17:42,360 --> 01:17:43,315
I'll explain.

1379
01:17:44,200 --> 01:17:47,160
In view of the problems with our 
friend across the woods...

1380
01:17:47,160 --> 01:17:48,160
The one that was interviewed?

1381
01:17:48,160 --> 01:17:49,520
Yes, Les. We filed for him in court.

1382
01:17:49,520 --> 01:17:52,240
Exactly. I told him not to use my 
real name.

1383
01:17:52,240 --> 01:17:54,000
He just took advantage of us.

1384
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:55,400
We won the case.

1385
01:17:55,400 --> 01:17:56,400
And now our film.

1386
01:17:56,400 --> 01:17:58,072
All the papers I have with me.

1387
01:18:05,120 --> 01:18:08,160
So, an injunction. Lefty Gladden needs

1388
01:18:08,160 --> 01:18:11,200
to keep you at a distance of 50 feet.

1389
01:18:11,200 --> 01:18:12,520
It's not that.

1390
01:18:12,520 --> 01:18:16,440
You know, I came up with several 
advertising options. This movie

1391
01:18:16,440 --> 01:18:18,360
you need to twist in theaters 
outdoors.

1392
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:20,874
It's a movie!

1393
01:18:21,080 --> 01:18:22,149
It's a note of redemption.

1394
01:18:22,280 --> 01:18:24,999
Here's a little mess. This is what 
you need.

1395
01:18:28,960 --> 01:18:31,440
Thank you. We've never met?

1396
01:18:31,440 --> 01:18:33,271
I don't think.

1397
01:18:34,520 --> 01:18:35,635
I swear I saw somewhere.

1398
01:18:36,360 --> 01:18:39,280
Guys, let's say we make a 
distribution of your film.

1399
01:18:39,280 --> 01:18:42,192
What else do you think off?

1400
01:18:43,080 --> 01:18:44,160
Another movie?

1401
01:18:44,160 --> 01:18:46,720
Exactly. Only this time larger.

1402
01:18:46,720 --> 01:18:51,480
I thought of doing something like 
Saturday fever - 3.

1403
01:18:51,480 --> 01:18:53,840
I could play the role of Travolta. You

1404
01:18:53,840 --> 01:18:56,240
saw me dance. I really...

1405
01:18:56,240 --> 01:19:00,240
Let me say this, with me as producer,

1406
01:19:00,240 --> 01:19:04,199
and Joe as an actor, Director and 
screenwriter...

1407
01:19:04,960 --> 01:19:07,997
America will finally get the movie of 
your dreams!

1408
01:19:09,360 --> 01:19:13,069
Make a contract now. Who is your 
lawyer?

1409
01:19:15,760 --> 01:19:17,920
My uncle Pepe, Yes it is true.

1410
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:24,155
Ok, I'm gonna get the ball rolling. You can expect the proposal 
from us ASAP

1411
01:19:24,760 --> 01:19:25,909
ASAP...

1412
01:19:27,320 --> 01:19:28,912
They put my Smokey to sleep.

1413
01:19:29,840 --> 01:19:31,637
No, that was ASPCA Pop.

1414
01:19:33,120 --> 01:19:36,317
So ? This is it right ? Looks like we got a deal ?

1415
01:19:40,840 --> 01:19:41,795
Yes.

1416
01:19:42,280 --> 01:19:46,239
It turns out we all agree.

1417
01:19:47,320 --> 01:19:48,275
Mr. Taski.

1418
01:19:49,760 --> 01:19:50,715
Joe Head.

1419
01:19:51,280 --> 01:19:52,952
- Thank you. <b> -.

1420
01:19:54,040 --> 01:19:55,314
I haven't said anything yet.

1421
01:19:55,560 --> 01:19:56,515
Yes, Yes.

1422
01:19:59,840 --> 01:20:00,795
For our future!

1423
01:20:01,480 --> 01:20:03,675
Be it a great film,

1424
01:20:04,200 --> 01:20:05,155
wild women...

1425
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:07,194
fast and steal cars.

1426
01:20:08,280 --> 01:20:09,840
- Hooray!
- Arriva!

1427
01:20:09,840 --> 01:20:10,795
Arriva!

1428
01:20:22,520 --> 01:20:23,840
This is only the beginning, Joe!

1429
01:20:23,840 --> 01:20:25,280
We're Hollywood, baby!

1430
01:20:25,280 --> 01:20:26,280
Wow!

1431
01:20:26,280 --> 01:20:27,600
Are you hungry?

1432
01:20:27,600 --> 01:20:28,555
Dying of hunger.

1433
01:20:28,640 --> 01:20:31,552
Go to Spagos. There is a delicious 
meal.

1434
01:20:34,920 --> 01:20:35,875
Open, Joe.

1435
01:20:37,280 --> 01:20:39,475
