AND I'VE COME TOO FAR FOR A NO ANSWER.

868
01:02:34,958 --> 01:02:39,958
A WHILE BACK IN BOSTON I SAW
THIS OLD GUY ON THE STREET

869
01:02:40,255 --> 01:02:42,840
AND HE HAD A SIGN ON HIS BACK THAT SAID,

870
01:02:42,841 --> 01:02:45,008
"PLEASE DON'T HIT ME."

871
01:02:45,009 --> 01:02:49,429
AND MY FIRST THOUGHT
WAS, "WHAT A SAD THING."

872
01:02:49,430 --> 01:02:51,640
BUT THEN...

873
01:02:51,641 --> 01:02:54,434
I GOT SO FUCKING MAD

874
01:02:54,435 --> 01:02:57,354
BECAUSE I REALIZED
THAT WAS GOING TO BE ME WHEN I GOT OLD.

875
01:02:57,355 --> 01:03:01,108
JUST AN OLD NUT SCARED OF THE WORLD.

876
01:03:01,109 --> 01:03:04,862
AND SO I'VE COME TO YOU.

877
01:03:04,863 --> 01:03:08,407
I WANT YOU TO TEACH ME.

878
01:03:08,408 --> 01:03:11,160
- TEACH YOU WHAT?
- ANYTHING.

879
01:03:11,161 --> 01:03:12,536
EVERYTHING.

880
01:03:12,537 --> 01:03:16,165
I NEED YOU TO KILL THE FEAR
THAT LIVES INSIDE OF ME EVERY DAY.

881
01:03:16,166 --> 01:03:17,666
YOU WANT TO SAIL THE MEDITERRANEAN,

882
01:03:17,667 --> 01:03:22,667
I WANT TO DO SOMETHING BRAVE BEFORE I DIE.

883
01:03:24,090 --> 01:03:27,843
HEY, LISTEN, KID...

884
01:03:27,844 --> 01:03:32,844
I EARNED 70 MILLION DOLLARS
BY THE TIME I WAS 19.

885
01:03:33,391 --> 01:03:36,935
DON'T CALL ME KID.

886
01:03:36,936 --> 01:03:40,105

887
01:03:40,106 --> 01:03:41,398
HOW?

888
01:03:41,399 --> 01:03:42,691
IT WAS NOTHING.

889
01:03:42,692 --> 01:03:47,692
I PUT A NEW TWIST
ON AN OLD TWIST ON COMPUTER SOFTWARE.

890
01:03:48,364 --> 01:03:51,450

DEFENSE I'VE EVER HAD,

891
01:03:51,451 --> 01:03:55,037
BUT IT'S NOT ENOUGH ANYMORE.

892

898
01:04:13,890 --> 01:04:17,392
YEAH, I COULD HELP YOU WITH THAT, TOO.

899
01:04:17,393 --> 01:04:21,730
HELP ME WITH WHAT?

900
01:04:21,731 --> 01:04:23,941
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

901
01:04:23,942 --> 01:04:27,736

904
01:04:30,782 --> 01:04:33,909
YOU HATE IT SO MUCH
IT'S THE ONLY PLACE YOU CAN STAY.

905

IT'S THE ONLY PLACE YOU'RE WORTHY OF.

906
01:04:37,205 --> 01:04:38,664
IT'S ALL SO OBVIOUS.

907
01:04:38,665 --> 01:04:40,332
WELL, IF IT'S ALL SO FUCKIN' OBVIOUS,

908
01:04:40,333 --> 01:04:45,333

01:11:40,753 --> 01:11:42,754

972
01:11:44,382 --> 01:11:45,840

- RIGHT THERE.

- YEAH.
- AND HE'S QUICK.

LIKE THEY WERE NOTHING.

975

AND HE TIES THEM UP BACK TO BACK,

976

THE WAY THEY WERE WHEN YOU FOUND 'EM.

977
01:11:53,849 --> 01:11:58,849
AND THEN HE RIFLES MY DESK,
HE TAKES THE 50 AND

978
01:11:59,855 --> 01:12:03,692
FOR NO FUCKING REASON HE GOES CRAZY

979
01:12:03,693 --> 01:12:08,693

IN THE WHOLE WORLD.

980
01:12:09,949 --> 01:12:10,449
WHY?

981
01:12:14,286 --> 01:12:18,039
PROBABLY HE'S PISSED
THAT THERE WASN'T MORE CASH.

982
01:12:18,040 --> 01:12:20,041
AND PROBABLY HE WOULD'VE KILLED ME, TOO,

983
01:12:20,042 --> 01:12:22,043
BUT THERE WAS A NOISE OUT IN THE HALL

984
01:12:22,044 --> 01:12:25,088
AND HE PANICKED AND HE RAN.

985
01:12:25,089 --> 01:12:27,966

01:12:27,967 --> 01:12:30,885

01:12:42,940 --> 01:12:47,940
- SOME.
- WHICH?

994
01:12:48,028 --> 01:12:49,696
YOU BETTER SPEAK, NICHOLAS.

995
01:12:49,697 --> 01:12:54,242
AND I SUGGEST YOU BEGIN RIGHT NOW.

996
01:12:54,243 --> 01:12:56,703
I'LL ASK JUST TWO QUESTIONS, BABY.

997
01:12:56,704 --> 01:13:01,416
IF YOU'RE GONNA ANSWER THEM
TO YOUR SATISFACTION, DO WHAT YOU WILL.

998
01:13:01,417 --> 01:13:03,084
FIRST, WHY WOULD I USE A GUN?

999
01:13:03,085 --> 01:13:05,712
THE FUCK KIND OF QUESTION IS THAT, HUH?

1000
01:13:05,713 --> 01:13:08,214
WHY DOES ANYBODY USE A GUN?

1001
01:13:08,215 --> 01:13:10,508
NICHOLAS NEVER DOES.

1002
01:13:10,509 --> 01:13:13,595
BELIEVE ME, HE COULD KILL YOU WITH...

1003
01:13:13,596 --> 01:13:15,597
HE COULD KILL YOU WITH THIS

1004
01:13:15,598 --> 01:13:19,017
FROM FIVE FEET OR 15.

1005
01:13:19,018 --> 01:13:21,227
AND THE ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION IS THIS.

1006
01:13:21,228 --> 01:13:22,771
IT'S THE PERFECT COVER.

1007
01:13:22,772 --> 01:13:25,440
NOBODY WOULD EVER DREAM
THAT NICK WILD NEEDED A GUN

1008
01:13:25,441 --> 01:13:28,526
TO COMMIT A ROBBERY.

1009
01:13:28,527 --> 01:13:31,112
ALL RIGHT, NICHOLAS. SECOND QUESTION.

1010
01:13:31,113 --> 01:13:36,113
SECOND AND LAST.

1011
01:13:36,577 --> 01:13:39,287
BABY, WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT MY BODY?

1012
01:13:39,288 --> 01:13:41,539
I MEAN, UNDERNEATH MY CLOTHES?

1013
01:13:41,540 --> 01:13:43,208
OBVIOUSLY NOTHING.

1014
01:13:43,209 --> 01:13:45,835
WELL, THEN, THERE'S MY SECOND QUESTION.

1015
01:13:45,836 --> 01:13:49,672
HOW IS IT POSSIBLE
THAT I KNOW THAT MR. DEMARCO HERE

1016
01:13:49,673 --> 01:13:52,467
HAS A SMALL BUT DEFINITE CUT

1017
01:13:52,468 --> 01:13:55,762
ON THE UPPER SIDE OF HIS HAMPTON?

1018
01:13:55,763 --> 01:13:57,847
ANSWER?

1019
01:13:57,848 --> 01:14:01,059
I SAW IT PUT THERE BY A DEAR SWEET LADY

1020
01:14:01,060 --> 01:14:02,560
WITH A PAIR OF GARDEN SHEARS.

1021
01:14:02,561 --> 01:14:04,103
WHAT IS THIS SHIT, HUH?

1022
01:14:04,104 --> 01:14:05,355
IT'S EASY TO FIND OUT IF I'M LYING,

1023
01:14:05,356 --> 01:14:07,106
JUST HAVE HIM TAKE DOWN HIS TROUSERS.

1024
01:14:07,107 --> 01:14:09,317
YOU'RE NOT BUYING THIS CRAP, ARE YOU, BABY?

1025
01:14:09,318 --> 01:14:13,154
SOMEONE GO GET A MICROSCOPE
SO WE LOCATE MR. DEMARCO'S PECKER.

1027
01:14:14,657 --> 01:14:16,074
