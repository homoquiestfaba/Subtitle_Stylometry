1
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:09,635
(Rock music playing)

2
00:00:17,117 --> 00:00:21,952
# Liberate me,
liberate me #

3
00:00:22,989 --> 00:00:27,483
# Liberate me, liberate me... #

4
00:00:30,964 --> 00:00:33,831
# Around the sun #

5
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:36,562
# On the run #

6
00:00:36,636 --> 00:00:40,094
# Nothing can stop me... #

7
00:00:40,173 --> 00:00:42,073
- (loud kissing)
- Man: You've got your whole life

8
00:00:42,142 --> 00:00:43,370
- ahead of you.
- Woman: Yeah.

9
00:00:43,443 --> 00:00:45,741
- People you are still gonna meet.
- Woman: I know.

10
00:00:45,812 --> 00:00:48,303
Whole college experience
still in front of you.

11
00:00:50,984 --> 00:00:55,546
- Woman: Mmm, you're right.
- Mmm.

12
00:00:55,622 --> 00:00:57,988
Woman: You promise
you're gonna write and call me?

13
00:00:58,058 --> 00:01:00,424
Hogan! Man, what the hell
are you doing?

14
00:01:00,493 --> 00:01:02,757
- They're already on the Ds.
- (Hogan groans)

15
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:06,196
- Mm-hmm. Shit.
- Mmm.

16
00:01:06,266 --> 00:01:08,097
Hello, Professor Goodbey.

17
00:01:08,168 --> 00:01:09,965
- (moans)
- Come on.

18
00:01:10,036 --> 00:01:12,800
We gotta go.

19
00:01:12,872 --> 00:01:14,965
Gladys, I'm never
gonna forget you.

20
00:01:16,042 --> 00:01:18,101
- You're so hot.
- No no no.

21
00:01:18,178 --> 00:01:19,543
All right. Sorry.

22
00:01:19,612 --> 00:01:21,079
- I love you.
- I love you, Gladys.

23
00:01:21,147 --> 00:01:23,581
Man over P. A:
Rebecca Gephardt.

24
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:29,279
Indigo Goldstein.

25
00:01:29,355 --> 00:01:31,755
Thank you very much, sir.

26
00:01:31,825 --> 00:01:34,760
# Liberate me... #

27
00:01:34,828 --> 00:01:36,955
Dag Griffiths.

28
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:38,930
Well done.

29
00:01:38,998 --> 00:01:40,989
- Hi!
- Hey.

30
00:01:41,067 --> 00:01:44,093
- Oh, lip gloss.
- Man: Chris Grizma, magna cum laude.

31
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:45,762
(whispering)
Hey, where were you?

32
00:01:45,839 --> 00:01:48,103
We were supposed
to take pictures before the ceremony!

33
00:01:48,174 --> 00:01:51,337
- Moffy Gurner.
- I know. Uh... um...

34
00:01:51,411 --> 00:01:54,141
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

35
00:01:54,214 --> 00:01:56,182
- Cindy Guilley.
- Here.

36
00:01:56,249 --> 00:01:57,910
Open it and put it on.

37
00:01:57,984 --> 00:02:01,317
Oh my God.
That is so sweet, Spence.

38
00:02:01,387 --> 00:02:04,185
- Man: Rebecca Hartowicz.
- Oh.

39
00:02:04,257 --> 00:02:05,781
- Oh...
- Man: Hello, Rebecca.

40
00:02:05,859 --> 00:02:08,089
Let me see it.
(gasps)

41
00:02:08,161 --> 00:02:11,130
- Oh...
- That's nice.

42
00:02:11,197 --> 00:02:12,994
Fuck off, Hogan!

43
00:02:13,066 --> 00:02:16,502
- Marshall Hogan III.
- That is my name. I must go.

44
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:18,594
Shit, I think I caught my dress.
Did I rip something?

45
00:02:18,671 --> 00:02:20,696
- (flatulence)
- Oh.

46
00:02:20,773 --> 00:02:23,139
You're such an ingrate, Hogan!

47
00:02:23,209 --> 00:02:25,541
Spencey, please meet me
in the quad

48
00:02:25,612 --> 00:02:28,240
after the ceremony
for pictures with my family, okay?

49
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:31,249
This is the photo that will define us
for the rest of our lives...

50
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:33,478
where we met and fell in love.

51
00:02:34,754 --> 00:02:36,619
- (chuckles)
- (giggles)

52
00:02:36,689 --> 00:02:39,886
Spencer Holmes,
with honors.

53
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:42,553
Okay, I'll see you there.
I love you.

54
00:02:48,268 --> 00:02:50,236
Mmm...

55
00:02:50,403 --> 00:02:52,337
(moans)

56
00:02:55,241 --> 00:02:57,573
Congratulations.

57
00:02:59,546 --> 00:03:02,515
Ladies and gentlemen,
meet our business class graduates.

58
00:03:03,008 --> 00:03:05,698
(sighs) It's just not the same
as standing in the quad

59
00:03:05,772 --> 00:03:07,997
- in our cap and gown.
- Oh, I'm sorry,

60
00:03:08,069 --> 00:03:10,158
- but I had to take Hogan home.
- Mmm.

61
00:03:10,234 --> 00:03:12,361
You know he has a problem
dumping in public bathrooms.

62
00:03:12,436 --> 00:03:14,958
- Nice image, thanks.
- Okay, look.

63
00:03:15,228 --> 00:03:17,884
We have a photo in front
of my childhood tree house

64
00:03:17,958 --> 00:03:20,683
I built when I was nine.
Isn't that good enough?

65
00:03:20,755 --> 00:03:25,308
- It's just not the same.
- (sighs)

66
00:03:25,384 --> 00:03:28,040
- Let's go get a drink.
- Okay.

67
00:03:28,114 --> 00:03:31,043
- (sighs)
- (sighs)

68
00:03:32,442 --> 00:03:35,166
Hey, can I get a beer

69
00:03:35,239 --> 00:03:37,395
and a shot of tequila and a...

70
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:39,729
a thumb in the ass
for my girlfriend?

71
00:03:44,062 --> 00:03:46,026
Look, all our problems revolve

72
00:03:46,094 --> 00:03:48,989
around your geriatric-loving
loser creep of a friend.

73
00:03:49,056 --> 00:03:50,917
And as soon as you outgrow him,
the sooner you'll be

74
00:03:50,988 --> 00:03:54,780
- to reaching your potential.
- Just enough with Hogan, please.

75
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:57,143
No. No, Spencey.
If you spend the rest of your life

76
00:03:57,214 --> 00:03:59,201
associating yourself
with that vermin,

77
00:03:59,279 --> 00:04:01,140
you will become
that vermin.

78
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:03,264
Spencey... hey, I love you,

79
00:04:03,341 --> 00:04:05,305
I just want
what's best for you.

80
00:04:05,372 --> 00:04:07,268
- I love you too. You know...
- Mmm...

81
00:04:07,337 --> 00:04:09,459
(woman laughing)

82
00:04:11,166 --> 00:04:13,651
Oh my God.
I'll be right back.

83
00:04:13,729 --> 00:04:15,784
Just so you know,
he will not be in our wedding.

84
00:04:20,555 --> 00:04:21,985
(laughing)

85
00:04:22,054 --> 00:04:25,073
What is that young man
doing out there with Edith?

86
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:26,977
I never saw anybody dance like that.

87
00:04:27,048 --> 00:04:30,135
Hey, are you sure they're dancing?

88
00:04:30,211 --> 00:04:32,868
If they're not,
he owes me some fucking money!

89
00:04:34,207 --> 00:04:37,294
- Hogan, what the hell are you doing?
- Spence!

90
00:04:37,369 --> 00:04:40,161
- I'd like you to meet Edith Birnbaum.
- Spence!

91
00:04:40,233 --> 00:04:44,558
Hello. Marshall here says
I'm the hottest chick at the party.

92
00:04:44,628 --> 00:04:46,887
- What do you think?
- Yeah.

93
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:48,718
- Whoo!
- Hogan, I'm sorry.

94
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:50,720
- I gotta borrow him for one minute.
- Ooh.

95
00:04:50,788 --> 00:04:53,478
- One second, we'll be right back.
- What?

96
00:04:53,552 --> 00:04:55,379
Do you really think
it's wise to get all grindy

97
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:57,209
with our future boss's wife?

98
00:04:57,281 --> 00:05:00,176
Dude, she is so fucking fine
and you know it!

99
00:05:00,244 --> 00:05:02,037
Look at that little tush.
Look at her tushy.

100
00:05:02,109 --> 00:05:05,559
- I don't understand you.
- Hey, how's the graduation boy doing?

101
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:07,568
Hey, all right.

102
00:05:07,636 --> 00:05:09,225
Hey, thanks... thanks
for the party, Dad.

103
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:11,389
Yeah, my pleasure, son.
My pleasure.

104
00:05:11,465 --> 00:05:13,224
Yeah, Dad, thank you.
You really outdid yourself.

105
00:05:14,628 --> 00:05:16,955
Just remember to mention
Stan Birnbaum in your speech today.

106
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:18,921
The guy never leaves
his frigging hospital.

107
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:21,419
He came out for your graduation
because he believes in you, son.

108
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:22,917
We'll get you at Yale Law in no time.

109
00:05:22,985 --> 00:05:25,006
Stan, it's my boy right here!
Here he is!

110
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:28,977
Stan. Nobody is more connected
to Yale Law than Stan Birnbaum.

111
00:05:29,046 --> 00:05:31,565
Thank you for putting in a good word
for me, by the way.

112
00:05:31,642 --> 00:05:33,765
Mrs. Holmes is responsible
for that, Marshall.

113
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:36,030
Maybe you should talk to her.

114
00:05:36,104 --> 00:05:38,226
- Don't forget, Spence.
- (stomach grumbles)

115
00:05:38,301 --> 00:05:40,197
(burps)

116
00:05:41,232 --> 00:05:44,353
Guess I lost that bet
we had two years ago.

117
00:05:44,428 --> 00:05:47,652
- What... what bet?
- I bet you wouldn't graduate.

118
00:05:47,724 --> 00:05:49,880
Oh, yeah? Oh.

119
00:05:49,955 --> 00:05:52,078
- Okay.
- Now I have to show you my tits.

120
00:05:52,153 --> 00:05:55,672
- Really? That's so great!
- Mm-hmm.

121
00:05:55,749 --> 00:05:57,508
- Excuse me.
- Do you wanna touch them?

122
00:05:57,607 --> 00:06:00,167
Yes. Oh!

123
00:06:00,243 --> 00:06:02,710
Hi, sweet... oh, hello.
Who's this pretty thing?

124
00:06:02,778 --> 00:06:04,075
Casey Dixon.

125
00:06:04,146 --> 00:06:06,807
Oh, aren't you just
the most charming girl?

126
00:06:06,881 --> 00:06:09,111
It's nice to see you two
getting along so well.

127
00:06:09,183 --> 00:06:11,117
Spencey, cake in 10 minutes.

128
00:06:11,185 --> 00:06:14,779
Thanks, Mom.
Ahem, excuse me.

129
00:06:17,023 --> 00:06:19,718
- Where's Hogan?
- Uh...

130
00:06:19,792 --> 00:06:23,057
I don't know.

131
00:06:23,128 --> 00:06:25,823
- (feedback)
- Thank you all for being here today.

132
00:06:25,897 --> 00:06:28,764
First, I'd like to take
this opportunity

133
00:06:28,833 --> 00:06:32,632
to thank my parents for all
the love and support they've given me.

134
00:06:32,702 --> 00:06:36,535
- I couldn't be more blessed.
- (applauding)

135
00:06:36,605 --> 00:06:39,301
I would also like to thank
my girlfriend Amanda

136
00:06:39,375 --> 00:06:41,774
- for all the lov...
- Oh. Whoo-hoo!

137
00:06:41,843 --> 00:06:45,574
- (laughs)
- I'll begin work next week

138
00:06:45,647 --> 00:06:48,740
at Birnbaum, Arthur,
Hollace, Craft & Steel.

139
00:06:48,816 --> 00:06:51,114
Uh, that's Birnbaum, Hollace,

140
00:06:51,185 --> 00:06:53,516
- Arthur, Craft & Steel.
- (laughing)

141
00:06:53,586 --> 00:06:55,781
I'm sorry.
I should probably learn that.

142
00:06:55,855 --> 00:06:59,415
In any case, I am very grateful
to you, Mr. Birnbaum,

143
00:06:59,491 --> 00:07:02,392
and I look forward to working
for you and learning a great deal.

144
00:07:02,461 --> 00:07:05,122
- (Edith moaning)
- What can I say?

145
00:07:05,196 --> 00:07:08,256
- I'm a very lucky man.
- (wood groans)

146
00:07:08,332 --> 00:07:11,300
- (screams)
- (all gasp)

147
00:07:16,171 --> 00:07:18,969
- Amanda: Eww.
- (murmuring)

148
00:07:19,041 --> 00:07:22,100
- Woman: Oh my God.
- Man: Busted.

149
00:07:22,176 --> 00:07:24,804
Uh...

150
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:27,278
- Sorry.
- (clamoring)

151
00:07:32,918 --> 00:07:35,512
(pants)

152
00:07:40,558 --> 00:07:43,186
- Well...
- You okay?

153
00:07:43,261 --> 00:07:46,627
...I don't think I ever actually begged
a man before today.

154
00:07:46,697 --> 00:07:48,562
Well, what did Mr. Birnbaum say?

155
00:07:50,333 --> 00:07:53,268
(choked)
I'm sorry, Spence, but, uh...

156
00:07:53,336 --> 00:07:56,498
he will no longer require
your services at his firm.

157
00:07:56,571 --> 00:07:58,664
(sighs)

158
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:02,300
What about me?
Would he require my services?

159
00:08:04,345 --> 00:08:06,869
(yelling)

160
00:08:06,946 --> 00:08:08,846
Dad! Dad.

161
00:08:13,385 --> 00:08:15,853
- (Mrs. Holmes sighs)
- (grunts)

162
00:08:21,526 --> 00:08:24,358
You know what, Dad?
It's okay, I got accepted into Baker.

163
00:08:24,427 --> 00:08:25,894
- Maybe I should...
- Mr. Holmes: Nonsense!

164
00:08:25,962 --> 00:08:27,452
No one's heard of Baker!

165
00:08:27,531 --> 00:08:29,964
We are gonna solve this one.

166
00:08:30,032 --> 00:08:32,330
- Mm-hmm.
- There's a man at the club.

167
00:08:32,401 --> 00:08:34,232
- Oh.
- Barry Stack is his name.

168
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:37,135
- He's an 18-holer, fine man.
- Uh-huh. Oh... Oh!

169
00:08:37,205 --> 00:08:39,799
A Yalie and he's head
of the biggest divorce firm in LA.

170
00:08:39,874 --> 00:08:42,398
- See?
- Not as connected as Birnbaum,

171
00:08:42,476 --> 00:08:45,240
but that's okay.
I'll make a call on your behalf.

172
00:08:45,312 --> 00:08:47,836
- Spence: Thanks, Dad.
- Yeah.

173
00:08:47,914 --> 00:08:50,747
What about Marshall?

174
00:08:50,816 --> 00:08:54,012
Well, he's practically family, Fred.

175
00:08:54,085 --> 00:08:56,246
And I'm sure he's very sorry
for what happened, aren't you, dear?

176
00:08:56,321 --> 00:08:59,915
Yes, I am. I really...
I truly am, ma'am... Mom.

177
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:03,391
Come on, Dad.
Give him another chance.

178
00:09:05,995 --> 00:09:07,860
- Fine.
- Spence: Yes.

179
00:09:07,931 --> 00:09:10,899
- Oh.
- Fine fine fine. If he screws this up,

180
00:09:10,966 --> 00:09:12,433
- he's our punter this month.
- No problem.

181
00:09:12,501 --> 00:09:16,960
And for you, son, I would be
disappointed beyond repair.

182
00:09:17,038 --> 00:09:19,006
- (stomach rumbling)
- (burping)

183
00:09:19,073 --> 00:09:21,041
- Spence: Dad.
- Oh!

184
00:09:21,107 --> 00:09:23,200
Excuse me.

185
00:09:24,277 --> 00:09:26,404
- Yes, sir.
- Oh...

186
00:09:29,481 --> 00:09:32,382
(woman giggles)

187
00:09:37,088 --> 00:09:40,579
(sighs)
I'll try Mr. Stack again, all right?

188
00:09:41,625 --> 00:09:43,889
Oh, nice.

189
00:09:43,961 --> 00:09:47,396
Oh... nice.

190
00:09:47,463 --> 00:09:49,090
Beautiful.

191
00:09:49,165 --> 00:09:50,563
Good. Good good good.

192
00:09:50,632 --> 00:09:52,896
Woman over intercom:
Mr. Stack, your interview is here.

193
00:09:52,968 --> 00:09:54,765
I'm coming.

194
00:09:57,972 --> 00:09:59,906
- He'll be right out.
- Thank you.

195
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:01,463
Thanks.

196
00:10:01,541 --> 00:10:04,601
You look so...
refreshing today.

197
00:10:04,677 --> 00:10:06,974
And the flower
is a very sweet touch.

198
00:10:07,045 --> 00:10:08,342
You look lovely.

199
00:10:09,781 --> 00:10:11,749
Stop.

200
00:10:15,653 --> 00:10:18,087
(grunts)

201
00:10:18,155 --> 00:10:20,145
Oh!

202
00:10:23,059 --> 00:10:26,152
You're so fucking good-looking.

203
00:10:29,061 --> 00:10:31,994
(grunts)
Ahh.

204
00:10:32,062 --> 00:10:35,028
(snorting)

205
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:44,688
- What was that?
- I don't know.

206
00:10:44,764 --> 00:10:47,230
- (club thunks)
- (metal clangs)

207
00:10:47,298 --> 00:10:50,890
- (woman screams)
- (panting)

208
00:10:58,033 --> 00:11:00,090
Why the hell are you two
just sitting there?

209
00:11:00,167 --> 00:11:02,532
Us?

210
00:11:02,601 --> 00:11:06,057
- Did you pass the bar yet?
- Haven't been to law school yet, sir.

211
00:11:06,135 --> 00:11:08,397
"Oh, we haven't been
to law school yet, sir."

212
00:11:08,469 --> 00:11:11,368
So you're just
a couple of shit turds.

213
00:11:11,436 --> 00:11:13,835
- Excuse me?
- Yes, sir, we are.

214
00:11:13,904 --> 00:11:16,995
- Do you shit turds wanna work here?
- Both: Yes, sir.

215
00:11:17,071 --> 00:11:19,799
Well, then, why am I...

216
00:11:19,872 --> 00:11:23,430
Iooking for my ball
and you're just sitting in there?!

217
00:11:26,373 --> 00:11:28,339
And you!

218
00:11:28,406 --> 00:11:32,032
Those plants...
they need dusting.

219
00:11:32,107 --> 00:11:35,268
- Plants?
- Uh, dusting?

220
00:11:35,342 --> 00:11:37,808
Good. Good good good.

221
00:11:37,876 --> 00:11:40,865
You're hired, you're hired,
you're all fucking hired!

222
00:11:40,942 --> 00:11:43,170
- (Archibald laughing)
- Woman: He forgets sometimes

223
00:11:43,243 --> 00:11:45,607
he hired me over 15 years ago.

224
00:11:45,676 --> 00:11:47,472
Oh.

225
00:11:47,544 --> 00:11:50,942
- Is that Mr. Stack?
- Oh, no. That was Mr. Archibald.

226
00:11:51,011 --> 00:11:54,500
But don't worry, he has hiring
and firing privileges too.

227
00:11:54,578 --> 00:11:57,272
I'll show you where we keep
the plant maintenance kit.

228
00:11:58,546 --> 00:12:01,342
Don't they have plant maintenance
people for stuff like that?

229
00:12:01,413 --> 00:12:03,743
Oops. They only come
once a week.

230
00:12:03,814 --> 00:12:06,246
Mr. Archibald
likes it done twice.

231
00:12:06,314 --> 00:12:09,440
It's okay.
Once you make partner

232
00:12:09,516 --> 00:12:11,505
you won't have to do it anymore.

233
00:12:13,949 --> 00:12:15,472
Woman over radio:
Good morning, Angelenos.

234
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:16,846
- (clock beeping)
- It's gonna be a hot,

235
00:12:16,917 --> 00:12:19,110
muggy one out there today,
busting up to the century mark.

236
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:22,708
And on to the news.
The stock market is up 12 points

237
00:12:22,784 --> 00:12:26,649
and, in sports, the LA Cougars
won the WABA Championship

238
00:12:26,719 --> 00:12:28,685
- by 16 points.
- (meows)

239
00:12:28,752 --> 00:12:31,844
And in entertainment news,
it says here a '60s sex symbol...

240
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:35,284
- (beeping continues)
- Spence, would you get that?

241
00:12:35,354 --> 00:12:37,287
...on Pacific Coast Highway.
That's right, that's what it says.

242
00:12:40,221 --> 00:12:42,154
(grunts)

243
00:12:42,222 --> 00:12:44,347
You bar-flunking freak!

244
00:12:44,422 --> 00:12:46,752
Where in the hell
did you get these numbers?

245
00:12:46,823 --> 00:12:48,789
I don't know.

246
00:12:49,924 --> 00:12:52,356
(whispers)
It's that Karl guy.

247
00:12:52,424 --> 00:12:54,322
(whispering)
You know what I heard?

248
00:12:54,391 --> 00:12:57,358
The poor bastard fucks
the file cabinets to blow off steam.

249
00:12:57,425 --> 00:13:00,017
You butt-licker!

250
00:13:00,092 --> 00:13:04,355
What part of your maggot-rotten brain
shit out these numbers?

251
00:13:04,426 --> 00:13:07,154
- Well, obviously, I made a mistake.
- Well, obviously.

252
00:13:07,227 --> 00:13:11,251
And now Sarah Tucker's alimony
is on the line!

253
00:13:11,328 --> 00:13:13,590
Better fix it...
best piece of ass I've ever had.

254
00:13:13,662 --> 00:13:16,685
- (licks)
- Did you hear that?

255
00:13:16,762 --> 00:13:19,058
The best piece of ass
he's ever had.

256
00:13:19,129 --> 00:13:21,187
Who brought you in here, anyway?

257
00:13:21,264 --> 00:13:24,662
Well, my Uncle William is
a good friend of Mr. Conrad.

258
00:13:24,731 --> 00:13:28,391
Well, that's not gonna save you
when you flunk the bar next month,

259
00:13:28,465 --> 00:13:31,523
because next month
you're gonna be good and fired.

260
00:13:31,599 --> 00:13:34,463
- I hope not.
- Good and fired!

261
00:13:36,634 --> 00:13:39,600
Karl, do you need to use the bathroom
or did you already shit in your pants?

262
00:13:41,101 --> 00:13:42,829
I might have
dripped a little, but, umm...

263
00:13:42,902 --> 00:13:46,733
It wasn't a real question,
you taint-licking hemorrhoid.

264
00:13:48,402 --> 00:13:51,528
- (crying)
- These guys are fuckers.

265
00:13:53,303 --> 00:13:56,896
I gotta go get the file boxes.

266
00:13:58,938 --> 00:14:00,904
Loosen up, would you?

267
00:14:04,839 --> 00:14:06,806
(whimpering loudly)

268
00:14:07,907 --> 00:14:10,738
(ballad playing)

269
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:29,036
Hi.

270
00:14:29,111 --> 00:14:31,077
(gasps)

271
00:14:31,144 --> 00:14:34,407
- Are you gay?
- What?

272
00:14:34,479 --> 00:14:36,502
No.

273
00:14:36,579 --> 00:14:39,171
No...

274
00:14:39,246 --> 00:14:41,178
Whoa, big fella. Down.

275
00:14:41,246 --> 00:14:42,769
It's not polite to point
in the office.

276
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:46,106
Gonna plant that mushroom?

277
00:14:46,181 --> 00:14:49,170
A little young for me, but...
oh, for you...

278
00:14:49,248 --> 00:14:51,044
(chuckles)

279
00:14:51,116 --> 00:14:54,549
I have... I have to get
the file boxes.

280
00:14:54,616 --> 00:14:56,741
- Okay.
- Okay. Take care of some business

281
00:14:56,816 --> 00:14:58,612
- while you're in there.
- Okay.

282
00:14:58,684 --> 00:15:00,547
I'm gonna push out
a little turtle head.

283
00:15:00,617 --> 00:15:02,345
- I'll meet you back in there.
- All right.

284
00:15:02,418 --> 00:15:05,680
Hey hey hey!
You two... shit-turd guys...

285
00:15:05,752 --> 00:15:09,685
get in here and get
the jelly out of my toes.

286
00:15:09,753 --> 00:15:12,720
- Uh...
- Mmm, mmm.

287
00:15:12,786 --> 00:15:15,514
I want you to really get in there...
under the nail.

288
00:15:15,587 --> 00:15:18,554
And give us a nice trim
while you're down there.

289
00:15:21,188 --> 00:15:22,381
(phone beeps)

290
00:15:22,455 --> 00:15:23,887
Stack:
What's going on with Doreen Wyes?

291
00:15:23,956 --> 00:15:27,286
- I gave you that lead a week ago.
- I'm on it, I'm sending an employee

292
00:15:27,356 --> 00:15:29,379
over to Formosa
Wednesday at 6:00,

293
00:15:29,456 --> 00:15:32,048
'cause that's where her husband
meets his girlfriend.

294
00:15:32,124 --> 00:15:34,454
Stack: Took you a fucking week
to figure that out?!

295
00:15:34,524 --> 00:15:37,184
There was some confusion
about which restaurant.

296
00:15:37,258 --> 00:15:40,157
Whatever.
Send someone fucking good this time.

297
00:15:41,326 --> 00:15:43,349
(phone beeps)

298
00:15:43,426 --> 00:15:46,359
- Ouch!
- Sorry. Sorry.

299
00:15:46,427 --> 00:15:49,951
I... I didn't know this was
part of your body.

300
00:15:50,028 --> 00:15:52,290
(retches)

301
00:15:54,262 --> 00:15:56,694
Oh, that's good, that's good.
That's good, that's good.

302
00:15:56,763 --> 00:16:00,025
Oh...
(chuckles)

303
00:16:00,096 --> 00:16:02,585
Uh, anything else, sir?

304
00:16:02,664 --> 00:16:04,892
Yeah yeah, there is.

305
00:16:05,118 --> 00:16:08,458
I got to this little piece
of dried-up shit turd

306
00:16:08,528 --> 00:16:11,401
that needs to be pulled
out of my ass.

307
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:14,343
Come on.
(laughing)

308
00:16:15,381 --> 00:16:17,114
I'm kidding you!

309
00:16:19,561 --> 00:16:22,330
- Get out.
- (retches)

310
00:16:27,819 --> 00:16:29,916
Dude, these lawyers...

311
00:16:29,993 --> 00:16:31,965
(chuckles)
Are a bunch of sweaty jackals,

312
00:16:32,032 --> 00:16:34,699
feeding off
of the weak and sick

313
00:16:34,773 --> 00:16:36,768
and injured little gazelles and shit.

314
00:16:36,846 --> 00:16:39,878
I mean, do you really want
one of these... scavengers

315
00:16:39,955 --> 00:16:42,828
- referring you to Yale?
- Right now,

316
00:16:42,897 --> 00:16:44,994
it's the best contact I have,

317
00:16:45,071 --> 00:16:48,980
but there's no reason
you should stay here.

318
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:51,079
Where the hell am I gonna go?

319
00:16:51,156 --> 00:16:53,686
Go wherever you want.

320
00:16:53,763 --> 00:16:58,175
Spence, now you know
I can't stand

321
00:16:58,244 --> 00:17:01,047
anyone that isn't
a hot older woman or you.

322
00:17:01,119 --> 00:17:03,615
- (chuckles)
- So wherever you go, I follow.

323
00:17:03,693 --> 00:17:05,858
This may sound
a little weak, lame,

324
00:17:05,933 --> 00:17:08,304
- even a little gay to some people...
- Yeah.

325
00:17:08,374 --> 00:17:10,779
...but fuck it.
I know what I like.

326
00:17:12,519 --> 00:17:14,617
- Hogan.
- All right.

327
00:17:16,832 --> 00:17:18,393
Let's get you in Yale.

328
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:21,103
Archibald: Karl!

329
00:17:21,179 --> 00:17:23,174
Out of my office, butt-licker!

330
00:17:27,531 --> 00:17:30,004
Hey, shit turd!

331
00:17:30,072 --> 00:17:33,310
Grab your shit-turd friend
and get in here.

332
00:17:33,382 --> 00:17:35,354
(laughing)

333
00:17:37,561 --> 00:17:39,533
Hogan!

334
00:17:51,469 --> 00:17:53,030
Hey!

335
00:17:59,828 --> 00:18:03,737
Silver BMW 535...
it's in the parking lot

336
00:18:03,807 --> 00:18:07,112
in the golf club in Bel Air.
Here's the license plate.

337
00:18:07,183 --> 00:18:09,656
Find it and slash the tires.

338
00:18:09,723 --> 00:18:12,094
Go. Now.

339
00:18:12,164 --> 00:18:14,033
Isn't that illegal?

340
00:18:14,104 --> 00:18:16,076
(laughs)

341
00:18:17,246 --> 00:18:19,241
Okay. No, I know
that it's illegal,

342
00:18:19,319 --> 00:18:22,625
but why would you want us
to do something illegal?

343
00:18:22,696 --> 00:18:24,965
Hogan:
My guess would be

344
00:18:25,036 --> 00:18:27,532
that the driver has
an afternoon court appearance

345
00:18:27,611 --> 00:18:29,606
that if he were to miss

346
00:18:29,683 --> 00:18:32,316
would cause him to severely fall
out of favor with the judge,

347
00:18:32,392 --> 00:18:35,697
considering that
it's probably over custody

348
00:18:35,768 --> 00:18:38,709
or some sticky issue like that.
The judge will look more favorably

349
00:18:38,777 --> 00:18:43,588
on the party that is actually in
the courtroom standing in front of him.

350
00:18:43,659 --> 00:18:46,224
Very good, shit-turd's friend.

351
00:18:48,172 --> 00:18:51,170
Now, when you're done with that,
you deliver these papers to my wife.

352
00:18:51,248 --> 00:18:53,847
She's at some bake sale
with her girlfriends.

353
00:18:53,922 --> 00:18:56,624
The address is on the envelope.
Tell her she can have her divorce

354
00:18:56,698 --> 00:18:59,103
as long as she understands
that she's now...

355
00:18:59,172 --> 00:19:01,611
totally fucked.
Tell her that...

356
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:04,209
- verbatim.
- Yes, sir.

357
00:19:04,287 --> 00:19:06,452
You're still here. Why?

358
00:19:22,006 --> 00:19:24,479
Dude, these guys make
so much fucking bank here.

359
00:19:24,547 --> 00:19:26,017
- Wow.
- I'm quitting my job.

360
00:19:26,086 --> 00:19:28,057
Man:
Hey, assholes.

361
00:19:29,529 --> 00:19:31,627
I've been rotting here
for five minutes.

362
00:19:31,703 --> 00:19:35,305
I don't wanna put you out or anything,
but do you mind fetching my car?!

363
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:38,378
(Slavic accent)
"Studman." Studman!

364
00:19:38,456 --> 00:19:40,394
Of course, we help you.

365
00:19:40,462 --> 00:19:43,494
- I run for studs.
- (whispers) What do we do?

366
00:19:43,571 --> 00:19:45,840
(whispers) I don't know.
A couple of things feel good to me.

367
00:19:45,911 --> 00:19:47,883
Okay, I go fast
for you now.

368
00:19:47,951 --> 00:19:50,082
A couple jerk-off
valet parkers.

369
00:19:50,157 --> 00:19:52,129
So listen, I changed
at the country club

370
00:19:52,197 --> 00:19:54,362
and I'll be in court
within the hour.

371
00:19:54,437 --> 00:19:56,466
What the fuck
are you looking at?

372
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:58,242
Que?

373
00:19:58,315 --> 00:20:01,118
Just some valet puke
giving me the stinkeye.

374
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:02,821
Guy's a moron.

375
00:20:02,896 --> 00:20:05,894
So listen, wrap up the Chicago deal,
let's get to Vegas.

376
00:20:05,971 --> 00:20:09,003
Yeah, I've got the four tee times
and strippers lined up.

377
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:11,850
No, I'm not bringing my wife.
What are you talking about?

378
00:20:11,923 --> 00:20:13,918
She starting to take me
to the cleaners in this divorce.

379
00:20:13,995 --> 00:20:16,126
No, I'm thinking of taking
that cute little court reporter

380
00:20:16,202 --> 00:20:18,197
from the Stony case.
She was pretty good orally,

381
00:20:18,275 --> 00:20:20,007
- but I tell you...
- (car tires screeching)

382
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,645
...she had a snatch the size
of the Lincoln Tunnel.

383
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:25,491
It's like fucking
a warm bucket of water.

384
00:20:25,563 --> 00:20:27,592
No, but I'll give you five...

385
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:32,342
Wha... what the fuck?

386
00:20:32,417 --> 00:20:34,548
(normal voice)
It's a little sticky

387
00:20:34,624 --> 00:20:36,596
coming out of second,
but other than that...

388
00:20:36,663 --> 00:20:38,224
I'm gonna kick your face in!

389
00:20:38,301 --> 00:20:40,536
Hogan, holy shit, man!
Come on, let's go!

390
00:20:40,608 --> 00:20:42,546
- Come on, go go go go go!
- Ah!

391
00:20:42,614 --> 00:20:44,779
You son of a bitch!

392
00:20:46,626 --> 00:20:48,621
That was crazy, Hogan.

393
00:20:48,699 --> 00:20:51,538
I think maybe you took
that one a little too far, huh?

394
00:20:51,608 --> 00:20:54,207
(Slavic accent)
What? You have job, you do it right.

395
00:20:54,282 --> 00:20:55,752
- Okay.
- Huh?

396
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:57,451
This is it.

397
00:20:57,526 --> 00:20:59,326
Whoa.

398
00:20:59,397 --> 00:21:01,597
Gotta work on
your accent, by the way.

399
00:21:01,671 --> 00:21:03,609
- Really?
- It was terrible.

400
00:21:04,321 --> 00:21:06,847
- Weird, I thought I was pretty good.
- You almost blew it.

401
00:21:06,926 --> 00:21:08,506
Hmm.

402
00:21:12,171 --> 00:21:14,870
- Come in.
- (women chatting)

403
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:25,868
Woman:
I'm sure you will enjoy these.

404
00:21:25,943 --> 00:21:28,238
They come
in all different kinds.

405
00:21:28,311 --> 00:21:30,468
They're like Easter eggs.

406
00:21:30,543 --> 00:21:33,348
And it will go
with anything you're wearing...

407
00:21:33,421 --> 00:21:36,328
or not wearing.

408
00:21:36,398 --> 00:21:39,882
This one, my little darlings,
is called "The Fire Alarm."

409
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:43,400
And trust me,
where your orgasms are concerned...

410
00:21:43,469 --> 00:21:46,539
all of you...
this one is the four-alarm fire

411
00:21:46,616 --> 00:21:48,704
that you have
been begging for.

412
00:21:48,782 --> 00:21:51,550
(laughs)
Look at it. Isn't it cute?

413
00:21:51,624 --> 00:21:54,392
Feliney metropolitanis.

414
00:21:54,466 --> 00:21:55,608
What?

415
00:21:55,684 --> 00:21:57,944
Cougars.
Everywhere.

416
00:21:58,019 --> 00:22:00,996
Oh my God,
look at the variety.

417
00:22:01,065 --> 00:22:05,057
Oh my, that's a Rolls-Royce,
very hard to nab.

418
00:22:05,125 --> 00:22:06,636
...spankings!

419
00:22:06,716 --> 00:22:09,149
There's some Cadillacs,
a little bit easier.

420
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:10,868
Oh my God, a Trans Am.

421
00:22:10,945 --> 00:22:14,222
Not exactly my flavor,
but definitely has appeal.

422
00:22:14,294 --> 00:22:16,796
Oh my God.
My personal favorite,

423
00:22:16,865 --> 00:22:20,856
a Silver Fox. Oh, so many
possibilities in one sitting.

424
00:22:20,926 --> 00:22:22,068
Down.

425
00:22:22,145 --> 00:22:24,705
Thank you very much.

426
00:22:24,783 --> 00:22:27,252
We'll have some refreshments.

427
00:22:30,706 --> 00:22:33,739
Woman:
This is a private party,

428
00:22:33,816 --> 00:22:37,532
but what can I do
for you two hunky hunks?

429
00:22:37,609 --> 00:22:41,968
We are Spence Holmes
and Marshall Hogan III,

430
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:45,824
and we're looking
for a Daniela Stack.

431
00:22:45,897 --> 00:22:48,261
Woman:
And what is this regarding?

432
00:22:48,334 --> 00:22:51,241
Well, we work
for her husband and...

433
00:22:51,312 --> 00:22:54,288
he wanted us to...

434
00:22:54,357 --> 00:22:56,007
give her this.

435
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:59,359
Oh. Oh, then you work
for my husband too.

436
00:22:59,432 --> 00:23:01,082
I'm Teddy Archibald.

437
00:23:01,157 --> 00:23:04,642
- No way.
- No way.

438
00:23:04,711 --> 00:23:06,730
So...

439
00:23:06,809 --> 00:23:09,843
what exactly goes on
at this sort of party?

440
00:23:09,922 --> 00:23:12,758
Well, we're just looking to spice up
our libidos a little bit.

441
00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:15,126
Aha. Yeah, I see. I see.

442
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,649
Edith: Marshall!
What a pleasant surprise!

443
00:23:18,719 --> 00:23:20,264
Oh, hey.

444
00:23:20,343 --> 00:23:21,727
Oh.

445
00:23:21,797 --> 00:23:25,512
Ladies, meet Marshall Hogan III.

446
00:23:25,587 --> 00:23:28,562
Our spectacular afternoon together

447
00:23:28,632 --> 00:23:31,065
became my inspiration

448
00:23:31,137 --> 00:23:33,733
for finding Lulu here

449
00:23:33,810 --> 00:23:36,175
and her "Art of Pleasure" schooling.

450
00:23:36,245 --> 00:23:38,335
Praise the clitoris, Edith.

451
00:23:38,412 --> 00:23:40,025
Yes!

452
00:23:40,104 --> 00:23:43,715
I came alive under
Mr. Hogan's tutelage,

453
00:23:43,793 --> 00:23:45,649
and my life's mission

454
00:23:45,721 --> 00:23:48,317
is to help you experience

455
00:23:48,393 --> 00:23:50,321
an awakening such as mine.

456
00:23:50,389 --> 00:23:53,896
Aside from handling me so expertly,

457
00:23:53,976 --> 00:23:57,424
he suggested I switch
to the Vivelle Dot

458
00:23:57,495 --> 00:23:59,791
hormone replacement therapy.

459
00:23:59,863 --> 00:24:01,652
And I must say

460
00:24:01,726 --> 00:24:04,827
it's worked wonders.

461
00:24:04,905 --> 00:24:06,901
Wonders!

462
00:24:08,492 --> 00:24:10,648
Whoo!

463
00:24:10,726 --> 00:24:13,528
Marshall.

464
00:24:13,601 --> 00:24:17,108
Perhaps you and your friend

465
00:24:17,189 --> 00:24:19,853
can help us out?

466
00:24:21,181 --> 00:24:23,302
Oh, anything.

467
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:25,976
Well, maybe...

468
00:24:26,053 --> 00:24:29,191
you could gather a group
of your friends

469
00:24:29,267 --> 00:24:32,002
who enjoy doing
what you enjoy doing,

470
00:24:32,076 --> 00:24:36,160
and we could connect them

471
00:24:36,237 --> 00:24:38,429
with my friends

472
00:24:38,505 --> 00:24:41,851
who enjoy doing
what I enjoy doing.

473
00:24:51,329 --> 00:24:53,798
Sounds like the cougars
need their prey.

474
00:24:53,866 --> 00:24:55,586
Ooh, well said.

475
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:57,518
We'll be in touch.

476
00:24:57,589 --> 00:24:59,745
Now, ladies,

477
00:24:59,822 --> 00:25:02,084
Lulu will take
your orders here.

478
00:25:02,156 --> 00:25:04,389
Grab a clipboard.

479
00:25:04,486 --> 00:25:06,575
Cindy Conrad,

480
00:25:06,652 --> 00:25:09,016
let me formally introduce you

481
00:25:09,089 --> 00:25:11,314
to Spence Holmes
and Marshall Hogan.

482
00:25:11,489 --> 00:25:12,975
They work for the firm.

483
00:25:12,989 --> 00:25:16,300
Ah. So you know that
ass-waxing prick that I'm married to.

484
00:25:26,202 --> 00:25:28,872
To Spence Holmes
and Marshall Hogan.

485
00:25:28,902 --> 00:25:30,227
They work for the firm.

486
00:25:30,605 --> 00:25:33,539
Ah. So you know that
ass-waxing prick that I'm married to.

487
00:25:33,605 --> 00:25:34,651
(all laugh)

488
00:25:35,016 --> 00:25:36,731
Have you seen Daniela around?

489
00:25:36,816 --> 00:25:39,548
They have something for her.

490
00:25:39,638 --> 00:25:42,159
Oh yeah, I dragged her here.
She's inside somewhere.

491
00:25:42,938 --> 00:25:45,427
Mmm, happy birthday to me.

492
00:25:45,178 --> 00:25:49,640
If you want,
I could give the papers to Daniela.

493
00:25:49,717 --> 00:25:52,583
That's okay, Teddy.
I'll take them.

494
00:26:06,434 --> 00:26:07,901
Oops.

495
00:26:11,437 --> 00:26:13,908
I assume he finally signed
my divorce papers?

496
00:26:13,976 --> 00:26:17,171
Yeah, um...

497
00:26:17,244 --> 00:26:19,905
and he... he also said...

498
00:26:19,979 --> 00:26:22,280
he said he wanted us to say...

499
00:26:23,751 --> 00:26:25,911
well, 'cause he wanted to...

500
00:26:25,986 --> 00:26:27,680
Hello, Marshall Hogan III.

501
00:26:27,753 --> 00:26:30,316
It's nice to see you again.
And may I say

502
00:26:30,392 --> 00:26:33,053
you deserve a future
of lasting happiness and peace?

503
00:26:33,127 --> 00:26:35,094
And may I also say
you've probably never

504
00:26:35,162 --> 00:26:37,026
looked or felt better in your life,

505
00:26:37,096 --> 00:26:38,397
am I right?

506
00:26:38,468 --> 00:26:41,094
- (laughs)
- Daniela Stack,

507
00:26:41,169 --> 00:26:43,932
this is my best friend,
Spencer Holmes.

508
00:26:44,004 --> 00:26:45,937
Hi.

509
00:26:46,005 --> 00:26:48,272
Daniela Darren now.

510
00:26:48,344 --> 00:26:49,776
Nice to meet you.

511
00:26:49,844 --> 00:26:52,403
Hi.

512
00:26:52,479 --> 00:26:55,679
Hogan:
Our job is done here,

513
00:26:55,752 --> 00:27:00,278
and we hope
to see you again.

514
00:27:00,354 --> 00:27:02,951
I hope so.

515
00:27:03,026 --> 00:27:04,925
Hi.

516
00:27:06,495 --> 00:27:08,462
Stop saying hi.

517
00:27:09,963 --> 00:27:11,900
- Hi.
- You're dehydrated.

518
00:27:11,968 --> 00:27:13,935
Bye.

519
00:27:17,038 --> 00:27:18,629
Hi.

520
00:27:30,153 --> 00:27:33,211
She just looked
right at me and said,

521
00:27:33,288 --> 00:27:35,782
"I hope so."

522
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:38,919
Oh my God.
What am I gonna do?

523
00:27:38,995 --> 00:27:40,484
You know what you're gonna do?

524
00:27:40,562 --> 00:27:42,495
Whatever the fuck you want.

525
00:27:42,563 --> 00:27:44,727
Now, you want to be with this woman,
be with this woman.

526
00:27:44,802 --> 00:27:47,133
Be with her and Amanda, who cares?
Be with all of 'em.

527
00:27:47,203 --> 00:27:49,397
Yeah, Stack too.
Fuck him...

528
00:27:49,471 --> 00:27:51,442
good and hard,
right up the ass.

529
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:52,976
Just fuckin' do what you want.

530
00:27:53,044 --> 00:27:54,977
- I tell you what else you're gonna do.
- What?

531
00:27:55,045 --> 00:27:56,603
This Edith thing.

532
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:59,344
Dude, right now my whole life
revolves around Yale Law.

533
00:27:59,418 --> 00:28:01,317
I know,
and you're going to Yale Law.

534
00:28:01,385 --> 00:28:02,977
Okay, I have no doubt
about that.

535
00:28:03,054 --> 00:28:05,816
But that's, like, the future.
I'm talking now,

536
00:28:05,888 --> 00:28:08,689
- and you're doing this Edith thing.
- What are you talking about?

537
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:10,283
Edith!

538
00:28:10,361 --> 00:28:12,158
Edith and the cougars!

539
00:28:12,228 --> 00:28:14,093
What?

540
00:28:14,164 --> 00:28:18,159
Wait, you want us to charge them
to have sex with us?

541
00:28:18,236 --> 00:28:19,930
No.

542
00:28:20,004 --> 00:28:21,800
No.

543
00:28:21,871 --> 00:28:26,537
We charge our friends
to have sex with them.

544
00:28:26,611 --> 00:28:28,100
- All right.
- You see?

545
00:28:28,179 --> 00:28:30,476
Now listen.
We start a little country club, okay?

546
00:28:30,547 --> 00:28:32,814
A "Cougar Club," if you will, right?

547
00:28:32,885 --> 00:28:35,614
And we charge membership fees
and shit like that.

548
00:28:35,687 --> 00:28:37,847
- Is that legal?
- Fuck it... yes!

549
00:28:37,922 --> 00:28:40,518
I don't know.
Who cares?

550
00:28:40,593 --> 00:28:42,822
I care! I have to.

551
00:28:42,894 --> 00:28:46,021
I, uh, no.

552
00:28:46,097 --> 00:28:47,996
- No no no no no, I can't do it.
- Oh...

553
00:28:48,068 --> 00:28:50,831
- "Cougar Club."
- Oh come, Spence, would you stop

554
00:28:50,903 --> 00:28:52,995
saying no to everything?

555
00:28:53,071 --> 00:28:56,201
Do you not get bored of that?
Say "yes."

556
00:28:56,276 --> 00:28:59,301
Yes, 'cause it feels so good.

557
00:28:59,379 --> 00:29:03,211
Yes, because you've never
taken a risk in your life, my friend.

558
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:05,581
Yes, because
Daniela Darren said,

559
00:29:05,652 --> 00:29:07,881
"I hope so"!

560
00:29:07,954 --> 00:29:10,513
Yes, because Edith Birnbaum
fucking demands it.

561
00:29:10,589 --> 00:29:13,026
"Supply us nice, horny cougars

562
00:29:13,094 --> 00:29:16,528
with nice, horny young prey."

563
00:29:16,596 --> 00:29:19,689
Aw, shit.
Why can't I ever say yes to you?

564
00:29:19,764 --> 00:29:24,499
Because sometimes Spencey
says "no" when he means "yes."

565
00:29:24,570 --> 00:29:26,867
Thank you, Mom.

566
00:29:26,938 --> 00:29:28,875
Thanks, Mom.

567
00:29:28,943 --> 00:29:31,172
Okay, well... night.

568
00:29:31,245 --> 00:29:33,235
- Spence: Good night.
- Hogan: Good night.

569
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:35,871
Mmm!

570
00:29:39,154 --> 00:29:41,882
"Because sometimes Spencey
says 'no' when he means 'yes."'

571
00:29:41,954 --> 00:29:45,222
- That was a fucking omen.
- Okay okay, shut up.

572
00:29:45,294 --> 00:29:48,420
For once in your life,
would you do something just for you?

573
00:29:48,495 --> 00:29:52,691
Say what you really want to say.

574
00:29:52,764 --> 00:29:55,793
How will it work?

575
00:29:56,870 --> 00:29:59,394
Hogan's voice:
We'll target 100 guys to start.

576
00:29:59,472 --> 00:30:02,603
That first group will pay $500
for the first year to join,

577
00:30:02,678 --> 00:30:05,043
and any members
after that will pay $1,000.

578
00:30:05,113 --> 00:30:08,945
They'll have direct access
of all our cougar-sponsored events.

579
00:30:09,015 --> 00:30:13,113
Now that includes access to profiles,
phone numbers... whole thing.

580
00:30:13,188 --> 00:30:15,621
And on the women's side,
Edith will be out in the wild

581
00:30:15,689 --> 00:30:19,957
gathering our hunters, marking them
with the gold Cougar Club necklace.

582
00:30:20,029 --> 00:30:23,121
All of our picks will
be those who strive to be with

583
00:30:23,197 --> 00:30:26,135
and who embrace
the older woman, or the cougar.

584
00:30:26,203 --> 00:30:30,570
And finally, we'll save room
for our one "must join."

585
00:30:30,638 --> 00:30:34,508
You tell me when, okay?
You tell me when!

586
00:30:34,578 --> 00:30:37,944
You-you tell me when.

587
00:30:38,013 --> 00:30:41,174
Want a whole dance, do ya?

588
00:30:41,248 --> 00:30:43,344
You want a whole d...

589
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:46,149
ahh! You're looking right at me.

590
00:30:46,222 --> 00:30:48,917
(cabinet squeaking)

591
00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:51,552
Karl? Karl, Karl.

592
00:30:54,830 --> 00:30:57,127
How long has this disaster
been going on, man?

593
00:30:57,198 --> 00:30:59,601
- Too long.
- Spence: Mmm.

594
00:30:59,670 --> 00:31:02,001
We're concerned, Karl.

595
00:31:02,071 --> 00:31:05,096
Yeah. And we...
we understand your need here.

596
00:31:05,173 --> 00:31:08,543
We do, it's just maybe you
and your little plastic friend

597
00:31:08,612 --> 00:31:10,943
would like to bang
something other than the files?

598
00:31:11,013 --> 00:31:12,139
Like what?

599
00:31:12,214 --> 00:31:13,646
- Like a woman...
- Yeah.

600
00:31:13,715 --> 00:31:14,947
...for God's sakes.

601
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:18,283
(snickers)
Yeah right.

602
00:31:18,355 --> 00:31:20,549
Not just any woman... no.

603
00:31:20,623 --> 00:31:22,685
Larry Archibald's woman.

604
00:31:22,761 --> 00:31:26,320
- His mistress?
- No, dude, his wife.

605
00:31:26,396 --> 00:31:29,228
We're starting a cougar club

606
00:31:29,298 --> 00:31:31,201
for guys just like you,

607
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:33,999
and we want you
to be a member.

608
00:31:34,071 --> 00:31:35,503
You do?

609
00:31:35,572 --> 00:31:37,300
Yeah.

610
00:31:37,373 --> 00:31:40,004
Now, it's 500 bucks to join,

611
00:31:40,078 --> 00:31:42,238
but it's well worth all the access
you're gonna have

612
00:31:42,313 --> 00:31:45,338
not only to Archibald's wife,
but all the other wives

613
00:31:45,415 --> 00:31:47,477
and the cougar friends
they're gonna bring with them.

614
00:31:47,554 --> 00:31:50,043
Yeah, but $500... that's...

615
00:31:50,121 --> 00:31:53,214
I mean, God, I...

616
00:31:55,295 --> 00:31:57,558
Okay, you know what?
Yes, please.

617
00:31:57,629 --> 00:31:59,858
Yes, I'll... yeah, all right.

618
00:31:59,931 --> 00:32:01,955
What's a cougar?

619
00:32:04,170 --> 00:32:06,160
- We'll explain later.
- Yeah.

620
00:32:06,238 --> 00:32:09,536
Clean yourself up.
We'll explain it to you.

621
00:32:09,606 --> 00:32:11,941
Here you go.
Congratulations.

622
00:32:12,011 --> 00:32:13,603
Thank you.

623
00:32:16,347 --> 00:32:18,247
Here you go.

624
00:32:20,254 --> 00:32:23,050
All right, man,
welcome to the club.

625
00:32:23,121 --> 00:32:25,645
- Oh thanks.
- Whoa, you're hot.

626
00:32:30,096 --> 00:32:32,290
All right,
welcome to the club.

627
00:32:32,364 --> 00:32:34,763
All right.

628
00:32:34,832 --> 00:32:39,032
Okay, welcome to Cougar Club.

629
00:32:39,105 --> 00:32:40,935
(all cheer)

630
00:32:41,006 --> 00:32:45,377
All right, now, all of your credit cards
will be swiped

631
00:32:45,446 --> 00:32:48,209
at every event to ensure
that all payments

632
00:32:48,281 --> 00:32:50,441
have been received.
If they're not,

633
00:32:50,515 --> 00:32:53,714
you will have the opportunity to make
these payments at the event.

634
00:32:53,787 --> 00:32:56,914
Now, for a little taste

635
00:32:56,990 --> 00:32:59,980
of what your new membership's
gonna bring you.

636
00:33:01,563 --> 00:33:03,723
Mmm!

637
00:33:03,797 --> 00:33:06,229
(man grunts)

638
00:33:06,298 --> 00:33:09,737
Yeah, this little sweetie's
name is Ingrid Stone,

639
00:33:09,804 --> 00:33:12,135
subcategory: Ferrari.

640
00:33:12,206 --> 00:33:14,435
She's a divorcée,

641
00:33:14,507 --> 00:33:17,444
working at one
of LA's finest financial firms,

642
00:33:17,512 --> 00:33:21,503
and she enjoys the headrush
she gets from a vertical 69.

643
00:33:21,581 --> 00:33:23,139
(all chuckle)

644
00:33:25,721 --> 00:33:29,280
(sighs)
So, gentlemen,

645
00:33:29,356 --> 00:33:31,983
let the hunt begin.

646
00:33:32,058 --> 00:33:34,325
(all cheer)

647
00:33:37,898 --> 00:33:38,364
(Dolly moaning)

648
00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:43,499
Hogan:
Dolly.

649
00:33:43,571 --> 00:33:46,437
- Oh God, oh...
- (Dolly squealing)

650
00:33:46,507 --> 00:33:50,468
- Sorry, Dolly.
- Don't fuckin' stop!

651
00:33:52,013 --> 00:33:55,539
Hey, shit turd,
meet me in my office.

652
00:33:55,616 --> 00:33:58,281
Shouldn't I clean
the bathrooms first?

653
00:33:58,355 --> 00:34:01,322
Stack:
You heard me. Get in here!

654
00:34:01,389 --> 00:34:05,851
So why are you
working at this firm,

655
00:34:05,929 --> 00:34:07,862
shit turd?

656
00:34:07,930 --> 00:34:10,864
Can you please stop
calling me "shit turd"?

657
00:34:10,932 --> 00:34:13,199
Mmm.

658
00:34:13,271 --> 00:34:16,363
Why are you here...

659
00:34:16,439 --> 00:34:19,032
shit turd?

660
00:34:19,107 --> 00:34:23,808
I want real-world experience
before I attend law school.

661
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:26,813
Well, most people go straight
to law school. Why didn't you?

662
00:34:26,881 --> 00:34:30,684
Well, I was accepted to Baker
and Anderson Lee...

663
00:34:30,755 --> 00:34:32,312
- Never heard of 'em.
- Right right.

664
00:34:32,389 --> 00:34:35,152
And what school
weren't you accepted to?

665
00:34:35,224 --> 00:34:37,593
Well, that would be Yale, sir.

666
00:34:37,663 --> 00:34:40,562
Now you see?
That one I've heard of.

667
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:42,824
So when I asked you
why you were here,

668
00:34:42,898 --> 00:34:44,831
you didn't tell me
the truth, did you?

669
00:34:44,899 --> 00:34:46,336
Oh.

670
00:34:46,404 --> 00:34:48,735
The truth is you're here

671
00:34:48,805 --> 00:34:52,103
because you need me to give you
a recommendation letter

672
00:34:52,174 --> 00:34:54,839
to guarantee you
acceptance into Yale.

673
00:34:54,913 --> 00:34:57,744
You're here because you're
too stupid to get in on your own,

674
00:34:57,814 --> 00:35:01,579
and you need me
to help do it for you.

675
00:35:01,649 --> 00:35:05,349
Now it seems
your dear old dad

676
00:35:05,423 --> 00:35:09,357
is on his hands and knees
ready to blow

677
00:35:09,425 --> 00:35:12,363
to make sure his shit turd
of a son gets into Yale.

678
00:35:12,431 --> 00:35:17,297
Now what do you think
I should tell dear old Dad?

679
00:35:20,639 --> 00:35:22,572
I don't know.

680
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,800
Well, I think you should tell him

681
00:35:24,875 --> 00:35:26,971
that you're my bitch.

682
00:35:27,046 --> 00:35:30,070
And maybe if you do
everything I tell you,

683
00:35:30,148 --> 00:35:34,277
your shit-turd ass might
wind up in Yale.

684
00:35:37,189 --> 00:35:41,055
Who authorized you
to change the locks to my house?

685
00:35:41,124 --> 00:35:43,721
You did.
Read the pre-nup, sugar.

686
00:35:43,797 --> 00:35:46,128
You know I still have
my things in there, don't you?

687
00:35:46,198 --> 00:35:48,392
Look, if you can't read the pre-nup,

688
00:35:48,466 --> 00:35:52,404
why don't you have your lawyer
or some hack read it for you?

689
00:35:52,472 --> 00:35:54,939
Or if you want to make it
easy on yourself,

690
00:35:55,007 --> 00:35:57,941
just stay married to me.

691
00:35:58,009 --> 00:35:59,946
I'd rather be dead.

692
00:36:00,014 --> 00:36:02,776
And by the way,

693
00:36:02,848 --> 00:36:04,509
this box of lingerie...

694
00:36:06,584 --> 00:36:08,578
not mine,

695
00:36:08,656 --> 00:36:11,953
you son of a bitch.

696
00:36:16,697 --> 00:36:18,664
(Stack sniffs)

697
00:36:20,199 --> 00:36:23,467
Don't you have
a toilet bowl to lick dry?

698
00:36:23,538 --> 00:36:25,903
Yeah. Yup.

699
00:36:36,082 --> 00:36:39,448
- Dolly: Are you okay?
- Go. Go.

700
00:36:39,522 --> 00:36:41,148
Go go.

701
00:36:43,290 --> 00:36:45,120
Dolly:
What's... what's going on?

702
00:36:45,191 --> 00:36:46,987
(car alarm beeps)

703
00:36:49,865 --> 00:36:52,855
Hey. Hi.

704
00:36:54,133 --> 00:36:56,127
What you did
back there was...

705
00:36:56,205 --> 00:36:58,798
was good.
It was really good,

706
00:36:58,874 --> 00:37:02,467
and I just want you
to know that...

707
00:37:02,542 --> 00:37:04,638
if you need
a place to stay,

708
00:37:04,714 --> 00:37:08,011
you can stay at my house.
Let me give you my number.

709
00:37:08,082 --> 00:37:11,482
That's very sweet,
but I'm staying with a friend.

710
00:37:11,551 --> 00:37:13,852
Nice to see you again, Spence.

711
00:37:13,923 --> 00:37:16,516
Wait wait wait, um...

712
00:37:16,591 --> 00:37:20,529
Would it be totally inappropriate
to invite you to dinner?

713
00:37:20,597 --> 00:37:24,554
I just don't think
I'm ready to see anybody right now.

714
00:37:26,567 --> 00:37:28,595
Thanks for asking.

715
00:37:28,672 --> 00:37:30,605
It's nice to be asked.

716
00:37:41,249 --> 00:37:44,585
I just invited her
to stay at my parents' house.

717
00:37:46,123 --> 00:37:49,454
Wow.
What am I doing?

718
00:37:53,464 --> 00:37:55,090
(grunts)

719
00:37:55,165 --> 00:37:56,631
Archibald just called me.

720
00:37:56,699 --> 00:37:58,962
He's screaming
for a foot scrub.

721
00:37:59,034 --> 00:38:01,437
- (siren wails)
- I told him you'd be right up.

722
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:04,972
(grunts)

723
00:38:05,041 --> 00:38:06,736
And stay away from the wives!

724
00:38:06,808 --> 00:38:09,439
Present, future, uh... past.

725
00:38:09,514 --> 00:38:11,276
Got it, dick hole?

726
00:38:14,784 --> 00:38:16,580
- Come on, Karl.
- Karl: Okay.

727
00:38:16,651 --> 00:38:17,746
- Let's go.
- All right.

728
00:38:17,822 --> 00:38:19,619
So good, they don't know shit
about Cougar Club.

729
00:38:19,691 --> 00:38:21,453
- No, but we gotta be careful.
- (squeals)

730
00:38:21,525 --> 00:38:23,549
Their antennas are up,
all of their antennas are up.

731
00:38:23,626 --> 00:38:25,597
- 'Night, boys.
- Good night, my little carnation.

732
00:38:25,664 --> 00:38:27,563
Oh!
(giggles)

733
00:38:27,632 --> 00:38:29,565
Hogan?

734
00:38:29,633 --> 00:38:31,099
Thank you, baby.

735
00:38:31,167 --> 00:38:32,963
Hey.

736
00:38:35,373 --> 00:38:37,840
Is Conrad's wife hot?
I don't remember.

737
00:38:37,908 --> 00:38:40,967
Yeah, but she's like 38.

738
00:38:41,043 --> 00:38:43,742
Oh. Little young for me.
I'll do her anyway,

739
00:38:43,815 --> 00:38:46,248
that way Karl here
can do Archibald's wife,

740
00:38:46,316 --> 00:38:48,306
I'll hit Conrad's,
you can hit Stack's.

741
00:38:48,384 --> 00:38:50,412
- Cool.
- I'm not hitting Stack's wife.

742
00:38:50,489 --> 00:38:52,423
I don't even know what
I'm doing with Stack's wife.

743
00:38:52,491 --> 00:38:54,082
- You can do it.
- (car honks)

744
00:38:54,158 --> 00:38:55,681
Spence:
Oh shit.

745
00:38:55,759 --> 00:38:58,595
(pop music playing)

746
00:38:58,665 --> 00:39:01,826
Hi. Did you lose my number?

747
00:39:01,899 --> 00:39:04,890
- No.
- Get in.

748
00:39:06,206 --> 00:39:09,504
There you go.
See you at home.

749
00:39:10,541 --> 00:39:12,474
(growls)

750
00:39:14,414 --> 00:39:15,938
- Hi.
- Hi.

751
00:39:16,016 --> 00:39:19,848
- Ah. This is a nice surprise.
- Mm-hmm.

752
00:39:20,884 --> 00:39:23,822
# You are the boys,
I'm just a girl #

753
00:39:23,890 --> 00:39:26,357
# We're not the same,
we're from different worlds #

754
00:39:26,792 --> 00:39:29,691
# You think you're smart
but you're no fun #

755
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:34,699
# How hard is it
to fall in love? #

756
00:39:34,767 --> 00:39:36,700
# Boys... #

757
00:39:36,768 --> 00:39:39,171
So, why are you avoiding me?

758
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:43,174
I'm... I'm not. I just...
work has been really...

759
00:39:43,242 --> 00:39:46,404
If you have something important
to say to me, then just say it.

760
00:39:46,481 --> 00:39:48,675
- (turns off music)
- Amanda, I don't.

761
00:39:48,749 --> 00:39:52,649
I just... just wanna go in
and go to sleep.

762
00:39:52,718 --> 00:39:55,053
Fine, let's go in
and go to sleep.

763
00:39:55,123 --> 00:39:58,989
Can't sleep with you
at my parents' house.

764
00:39:59,059 --> 00:40:00,992
That's right.

765
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:03,327
That's why I think
you should move in with me.

766
00:40:03,398 --> 00:40:04,659
Oh, Amanda.

767
00:40:04,732 --> 00:40:07,325
We are ready
for that next step, Spencey...

768
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:10,562
our first apartment.
And I'm even willing to cover the rent,

769
00:40:10,636 --> 00:40:13,368
because I know you'll be
facing enormous law-school bills

770
00:40:13,441 --> 00:40:16,568
and I know my assistance to you
will be paid back to me tenfold

771
00:40:16,643 --> 00:40:19,114
once you're out of law school
and we're married!

772
00:40:19,182 --> 00:40:20,273
Wow, Amanda...

773
00:40:20,348 --> 00:40:22,747
It'll be like that movie,
"Pay It Forward," with Kevin Spacey.

774
00:40:22,817 --> 00:40:25,512
You'll be Helen Hunt,
I'll be Kevin Spacey.

775
00:40:25,585 --> 00:40:27,783
Okay, I didn't see that one.
Amanda, look, I think we...

776
00:40:27,857 --> 00:40:30,585
- Spencey, I love you.
- I love you too.

777
00:40:30,658 --> 00:40:32,182
(chuckles)
It's just, I'm not...

778
00:40:32,259 --> 00:40:33,748
Shh shh shh shh.

779
00:40:33,827 --> 00:40:35,855
Just think about it.

780
00:40:35,932 --> 00:40:38,263
It's perfect. Okay?

781
00:40:38,333 --> 00:40:39,731
- Kiss.
- Okay.

782
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:41,028
Lip gloss, though.

783
00:40:41,102 --> 00:40:42,932
All right.

784
00:40:43,002 --> 00:40:44,973
(gardener whistling
"Battle Hymn of the Republic")

785
00:40:54,683 --> 00:40:57,515
- (sighs)
- (music blaring)

786
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:03,451
Four-leaf clover. Agh!

787
00:41:05,227 --> 00:41:06,693
Here we go.

788
00:41:08,232 --> 00:41:09,755
You boys sleep tight.

789
00:41:09,832 --> 00:41:11,823
- Thanks, Mom.
- Thanks, Mom.

790
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:14,891
See, you think Amanda's gonna
do shit like this for you?

791
00:41:14,969 --> 00:41:16,599
What are you doing?

792
00:41:16,673 --> 00:41:18,765
What? This is avocado
and banana.

793
00:41:18,841 --> 00:41:20,502
You use this stuff,
you never go bald.

794
00:41:20,576 --> 00:41:21,769
- Really?
- Yup.

795
00:41:21,843 --> 00:41:23,833
- It's tingling.
- Is it supposed to?

796
00:41:23,911 --> 00:41:25,074
I don't know.

797
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:28,242
So, what's the deal again
with Mrs. Birnbaum?

798
00:41:28,317 --> 00:41:30,841
Okay, now Edith's gonna get a 10% fee

799
00:41:30,919 --> 00:41:33,788
for supplying us
with hundreds of hot cougars.

800
00:41:33,857 --> 00:41:35,915
- Totally worth it.
- All right.

801
00:41:35,992 --> 00:41:38,017
- Wow.
- Did you give her the divorcée files

802
00:41:38,093 --> 00:41:39,526
- from the office?
- Yes.

803
00:41:39,594 --> 00:41:41,929
And she's totally set up for success.
Now, all we need

804
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,466
is one kick-ass party

805
00:41:43,534 --> 00:41:46,366
to get the word-of-mouth
we kind of need to expand here.

806
00:41:46,435 --> 00:41:48,928
And I want to go all the way
with this Cougar Club thing.

807
00:41:49,007 --> 00:41:52,840
I'm talking Internet,
magazines, calendars.

808
00:41:52,910 --> 00:41:55,775
I want to go full-on,
nationwide organization.

809
00:41:55,844 --> 00:41:57,781
- It's burning! Burning now!
- Man, you should really

810
00:41:57,849 --> 00:41:59,146
- just wash that out.
- Yes!

811
00:41:59,217 --> 00:42:01,878
- Hoo!
- (shower running)

812
00:42:01,952 --> 00:42:04,718
So, where should
our first party be?

813
00:42:05,858 --> 00:42:08,018
Marshall, I just don't know
how to thank you for this.

814
00:42:08,092 --> 00:42:10,854
Barnaby's in Manhattan Beach
is one of our absolute favorites.

815
00:42:10,927 --> 00:42:11,894
Isn't it, Fred?

816
00:42:11,961 --> 00:42:13,829
Oh no, are you kidding me?
Thank you

817
00:42:13,899 --> 00:42:16,025
for letting me show
my gratitude to you two.

818
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:17,999
Oh, isn't that sweet, Fred?

819
00:42:18,068 --> 00:42:19,830
- Okay, come on.
- (stomach growling)

820
00:42:19,902 --> 00:42:22,032
- Hey, what are you guys doing tonight?
- Let's go.

821
00:42:22,107 --> 00:42:23,869
Tonight's gonna be
a big night actually,

822
00:42:23,942 --> 00:42:26,136
- 'cause we have a meeting of all...
- Wow!

823
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:28,643
- Might have a few people over...
- Oh.

824
00:42:28,711 --> 00:42:30,409
...watch some movies,
play some games.

825
00:42:30,482 --> 00:42:32,881
- Naked Marco Polo.
- That sounds nice.

826
00:42:32,951 --> 00:42:34,713
Well, there are plenty
of sodas in the fridge.

827
00:42:34,785 --> 00:42:36,719
- Awesome.
- Have a good time.

828
00:42:36,787 --> 00:42:38,690
Thanks, Mom.

829
00:42:39,725 --> 00:42:41,715
Come on, honey.

830
00:42:41,793 --> 00:42:45,193
Do you have any idea how much
hot cougar ass is gonna be here tonight?

831
00:42:45,266 --> 00:42:47,699
Completely out of control.

832
00:42:47,766 --> 00:42:50,233
All three of the bosses' wives
are gonna be represented.

833
00:42:50,301 --> 00:42:52,598
- (sighs)
- (car engine turns over)

834
00:42:52,669 --> 00:42:54,367
- Wow.
- Operation Bosses'-Wife-Fuck

835
00:42:54,441 --> 00:42:56,704
is definitely a go.

836
00:42:56,775 --> 00:42:59,208
Bye-bye!

837
00:43:01,011 --> 00:43:02,949
- Okay, calm down.
- Yeah, okay.

838
00:43:03,016 --> 00:43:05,745
- Seriously, calm down.
- Man: # Roll, bitches! #

839
00:43:05,818 --> 00:43:07,409
# One two three four #

840
00:43:07,485 --> 00:43:09,718
(rock music playing)

841
00:43:12,692 --> 00:43:14,955
# Loaded cougar
motherfuckers! #

842
00:43:15,027 --> 00:43:18,056
# Comin' atcha... #

843
00:43:27,141 --> 00:43:30,268
Teddy Archibald.

844
00:43:30,343 --> 00:43:33,072
Hey, you look ravishing tonight.

845
00:43:33,145 --> 00:43:35,207
- Doesn't she, guys?
- Well, thank you, Hogan.

846
00:43:35,284 --> 00:43:36,944
Oh, you're so welcome.

847
00:43:37,018 --> 00:43:39,042
Who's your little friend?

848
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:42,682
Teddy Archibald, I'd like you
to meet Karl Dessler.

849
00:43:44,392 --> 00:43:46,223
Hello, Karl.

850
00:43:46,294 --> 00:43:48,488
Hi... ah!

851
00:43:48,561 --> 00:43:50,532
(laughs) Hey!

852
00:43:52,968 --> 00:43:54,764
I'm not sure she's even a woman.

853
00:43:54,835 --> 00:43:57,563
Uh, I'm not sure he'll even notice.

854
00:43:57,636 --> 00:43:58,937
Mm, you're right.

855
00:43:59,008 --> 00:44:00,736
(woman laughing)

856
00:44:00,809 --> 00:44:02,799
Whoo!

857
00:44:02,877 --> 00:44:05,811
Cindy Conrad is here.

858
00:44:05,879 --> 00:44:07,816
Oh.

859
00:44:07,884 --> 00:44:10,477
- I remember now, Trans Am.
- Uh-huh.

860
00:44:10,551 --> 00:44:13,747
Hogan:
Let's go get reacquainted.

861
00:44:13,820 --> 00:44:16,155
Holy shit, she's here. I can't...

862
00:44:16,225 --> 00:44:18,590
Spence, no. Hey, come on.

863
00:44:18,660 --> 00:44:21,059
Don't puss out now.

864
00:44:22,162 --> 00:44:25,191
Oh, Cindy Conrad.

865
00:44:25,268 --> 00:44:26,359
Wow.

866
00:44:26,435 --> 00:44:28,368
- Marshall Hogan.
- Hi.

867
00:44:28,436 --> 00:44:30,028
- It's so good to see you again.
- Yeah.

868
00:44:30,103 --> 00:44:32,734
Wanna fuck?

869
00:44:36,844 --> 00:44:38,368
(gasps)

870
00:44:41,050 --> 00:44:42,847
Okay.

871
00:44:44,252 --> 00:44:46,219
(both giggling)

872
00:44:50,893 --> 00:44:53,087
- Hi, Spence.
- Hi.

873
00:44:56,467 --> 00:44:59,867
Can I, uh, get you a drink or...

874
00:44:59,936 --> 00:45:02,165
anything? Yeah.

875
00:45:02,237 --> 00:45:04,538
Do you mind if I?

876
00:45:04,609 --> 00:45:06,974
Thanks.

877
00:45:07,044 --> 00:45:08,874
So...

878
00:45:08,945 --> 00:45:11,537
how's it going?

879
00:45:11,616 --> 00:45:15,051
Never better. He's dating someone
he thinks he could marry,

880
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:17,814
so I'm hearing less from him,
which is great.

881
00:45:17,887 --> 00:45:19,824
Can I ask you something?

882
00:45:19,892 --> 00:45:21,882
"Why did I marry him
in the first place?"

883
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:24,756
No no no, I didn't mean to pry,
it's just that...

884
00:45:24,827 --> 00:45:28,596
you are too beautiful and smart

885
00:45:28,667 --> 00:45:31,225
and nice to be married
to a guy like him.

886
00:45:31,301 --> 00:45:34,030
I won't miss the way
you're looking at me right now.

887
00:45:34,103 --> 00:45:36,904
Everyone looks at me that way,
even when they hear he's my husband.

888
00:45:36,976 --> 00:45:39,909
- I feel bad for you.
- Well don't,

889
00:45:39,977 --> 00:45:41,774
because I kinda hate that.

890
00:45:41,845 --> 00:45:44,247
I'm not a victim. I left.

891
00:45:46,152 --> 00:45:50,177
Look, Cindy dragged me here tonight,

892
00:45:50,254 --> 00:45:51,914
but it's really not my scene.

893
00:45:51,988 --> 00:45:54,186
I'm not into
a meaningless relationship

894
00:45:54,260 --> 00:45:57,659
with some guy who wasn't even
born before disco.

895
00:45:58,695 --> 00:46:00,529
Excuse me.

896
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:02,499
Wait.

897
00:46:19,452 --> 00:46:21,749
Peek-a-boo.

898
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:24,219
- Trans...
- Mmm!

899
00:46:24,288 --> 00:46:27,260
...am.
(giggles)

900
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:28,588
Uh-oh.

901
00:46:28,661 --> 00:46:31,390
- Watcha doin' down there?
- Hide...

902
00:46:31,463 --> 00:46:32,656
and seek.

903
00:46:32,729 --> 00:46:35,428
(sings)
What is she doing?

904
00:46:35,502 --> 00:46:37,992
- She's in there.
- (both laugh)

905
00:46:39,304 --> 00:46:41,172
Uh-oh! Can I...

906
00:46:43,677 --> 00:46:45,576
Ow!

907
00:46:45,644 --> 00:46:47,941
Ah!

908
00:46:49,384 --> 00:46:51,510
(Karl pants, yelps)

909
00:46:51,586 --> 00:46:53,348
Sorry about the bed.

910
00:46:53,420 --> 00:46:56,785
The... king size
is on back order,

911
00:46:56,855 --> 00:46:58,826
so...

912
00:46:58,893 --> 00:47:00,587
Do you and Hogan
share a room?

913
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:02,252
What?

914
00:47:02,329 --> 00:47:05,596
No. No no no no.

915
00:47:05,667 --> 00:47:07,031
Nope.

916
00:47:08,202 --> 00:47:09,668
- Mm.
- Mm.

917
00:47:09,736 --> 00:47:11,828
(Karl moaning)

918
00:47:21,751 --> 00:47:24,218
(Cindy laughing)

919
00:47:24,286 --> 00:47:25,684
Mm... ow.

920
00:47:25,753 --> 00:47:27,652
How do you feel...

921
00:47:32,060 --> 00:47:33,856
about feet?

922
00:47:43,070 --> 00:47:44,161
Ow.

923
00:47:50,811 --> 00:47:52,971
Mm, oh!

924
00:47:53,046 --> 00:47:54,574
Oh, just...

925
00:47:54,652 --> 00:47:57,676
- it's so hard, just need a minute.
- Okay okay.

926
00:47:59,121 --> 00:48:01,088
(Cindy moaning)

927
00:48:03,993 --> 00:48:06,859
(Cindy panting)

928
00:48:09,664 --> 00:48:12,635
Shh shh.

929
00:48:15,971 --> 00:48:17,835
Okay.

930
00:48:17,905 --> 00:48:20,206
- No more "shush."
- I'm ready.

931
00:48:20,277 --> 00:48:23,438
I know,
I can feel it.

932
00:48:23,512 --> 00:48:25,241
- Ooh!
- Mm.

933
00:48:25,313 --> 00:48:27,841
- So young.
- Yeah, so young.

934
00:48:27,918 --> 00:48:29,078
So young.

935
00:48:43,602 --> 00:48:46,900
(Teddy moaning)

936
00:48:46,971 --> 00:48:49,200
Oh yeah!

937
00:48:49,271 --> 00:48:50,636
Take your time!

938
00:48:58,180 --> 00:49:00,981
You know that if you smack my ass,
it doesn't move.

939
00:49:02,020 --> 00:49:03,953
Yeah. Go ahead.

940
00:49:04,021 --> 00:49:05,715
Smack it.

941
00:49:05,788 --> 00:49:07,986
Punch it if you want to.
Go ahead.

942
00:49:08,060 --> 00:49:11,323
Smack it! Smack it!

943
00:49:12,363 --> 00:49:14,592
- Okay?
- Whoo! Ha ha ha!

944
00:49:14,664 --> 00:49:16,862
Wah!

945
00:49:19,304 --> 00:49:20,736
Mommy.

946
00:49:20,804 --> 00:49:24,902
# Drop your panties
to the floor #

947
00:49:24,977 --> 00:49:28,139
- # Come on... #
- Wanna do it again?

948
00:49:28,213 --> 00:49:30,077
# Drop your panties... #

949
00:49:30,147 --> 00:49:31,408
Yep.

950
00:49:31,481 --> 00:49:34,282
# Drop your panties
to the floor #

951
00:49:34,353 --> 00:49:36,980
# To the floor,
to the floor #

952
00:49:37,055 --> 00:49:39,318
# Drop your panties #

953
00:49:39,389 --> 00:49:42,555
- # Drop your panties... #
- (horn honks)

954
00:49:48,335 --> 00:49:51,701
Holy shit.

955
00:49:51,771 --> 00:49:53,897
It's my parents.

956
00:49:55,939 --> 00:49:59,104
Spencer, you're a 22-year-old man.
You're allowed to have sex.

957
00:49:59,178 --> 00:50:01,645
No no, it's not...
it's not the sex part.

958
00:50:01,713 --> 00:50:04,044
It's the...
the party part.

959
00:50:10,455 --> 00:50:12,449
Holy shit, it's Barry.

960
00:50:12,527 --> 00:50:15,051
- What?
- Barry, my ex-husband.

961
00:50:15,128 --> 00:50:16,458
Your boss!

962
00:50:16,529 --> 00:50:19,361
Fuck! Don't move.

963
00:50:19,431 --> 00:50:21,766
Stay here until I get back.

964
00:50:28,811 --> 00:50:30,903
- Nice place.
- Oh, thanks.

965
00:50:32,245 --> 00:50:35,008
Mom and Dad are home,
and they're with Barry Stack.

966
00:50:35,081 --> 00:50:36,069
- Fuck!
- Fuck!

967
00:50:36,147 --> 00:50:38,584
Go outside, make sure everyone stays
out of the fuckin' house.

968
00:50:38,653 --> 00:50:40,847
Yeah. Go go go go.

969
00:50:40,921 --> 00:50:44,219
- Go go go go go go!
- Come on!

970
00:50:44,290 --> 00:50:46,022
(mutters)

971
00:50:46,095 --> 00:50:48,028
(woman moaning)

972
00:50:51,731 --> 00:50:54,931
Oh, come on.
Are you kidding me?

973
00:50:55,003 --> 00:50:57,197
Take it outside!

974
00:50:58,405 --> 00:51:00,429
Fred:
Okay, here we... come on.

975
00:51:00,506 --> 00:51:01,841
Here we are.

976
00:51:01,911 --> 00:51:04,174
Mom, Dad!
Mr. Stack!

977
00:51:04,246 --> 00:51:06,406
Wow, what a surprise.
Well, this is great.

978
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:08,539
Look who we ran into
at Barnaby's, huh?

979
00:51:08,615 --> 00:51:11,017
He was at a wedding reception
in the outside garden.

980
00:51:11,086 --> 00:51:12,849
- Oh, it was stunning.
- Oh, I see, I see.

981
00:51:12,921 --> 00:51:16,878
I thought... I thought you and Mom
were gonna spend the night, but?

982
00:51:16,957 --> 00:51:19,792
- Well...
- Oh, your dad had a touch of diarrhea.

983
00:51:19,862 --> 00:51:22,091
So let's...
let's just go sit in the living room.

984
00:51:22,163 --> 00:51:24,960
Uh, the living room, Mom,
that's a great idea.

985
00:51:25,031 --> 00:51:29,026
No no, nonsense, nonsense.
The living room's for Yale-bred.

986
00:51:29,104 --> 00:51:31,037
Men talk in the den.

987
00:51:31,105 --> 00:51:33,599
- Hmm?
- Mmm.

988
00:51:33,677 --> 00:51:36,042
Ah! Now we're talking, huh?

989
00:51:36,112 --> 00:51:37,408
Oh... whoa!

990
00:51:37,479 --> 00:51:39,469
Fred:
Watch your step there.

991
00:51:41,282 --> 00:51:42,946
- Mom: Okay now, Fred,
- Yeah?

992
00:51:43,020 --> 00:51:45,112
I'm gonna go get you
your little orange miracle-worker.

993
00:51:45,188 --> 00:51:46,814
Anybody for coffee
or bundt cake?

994
00:51:46,889 --> 00:51:48,549
- Fantastic.
- You know what, Mom?

995
00:51:48,623 --> 00:51:51,754
Why don't you stay here
and I'll go get the coffee...

996
00:51:51,829 --> 00:51:53,386
Oh honey, no, you sit.

997
00:51:53,463 --> 00:51:55,225
Honey, Dad and Mr. Stack
are gonna talk

998
00:51:55,297 --> 00:51:56,991
about your
recommendation letter to Yale.

999
00:51:57,064 --> 00:51:59,399
- You stay.
- It would be inappropriate

1000
00:51:59,470 --> 00:52:03,165
for me to try to influence
Mr. Stack directly.

1001
00:52:03,238 --> 00:52:04,830
Fred:
No no no, sit sit sit.

1002
00:52:04,907 --> 00:52:06,138
Excuse me.

1003
00:52:07,212 --> 00:52:10,338
He's an... impetuous kid,
you know?

1004
00:52:24,895 --> 00:52:27,692
- Mo... Mom!
- Oh honey! Didn't know you were here.

1005
00:52:27,764 --> 00:52:30,634
Sweetheart, would you look in
the fridge and get that bundt cake?

1006
00:52:30,703 --> 00:52:31,669
Sure, absolutely.

1007
00:52:31,736 --> 00:52:34,101
- Oh, and a can of whipped cream.
- Uh...

1008
00:52:34,171 --> 00:52:37,003
- I don't see it.
- Really, I know I bought some.

1009
00:52:37,073 --> 00:52:39,203
- (can spraying)
- Oh good, you found it.

1010
00:52:39,278 --> 00:52:41,245
I knew I bought that.

1011
00:52:46,382 --> 00:52:49,547
- (spraying)
- Honey, is that your tummy?

1012
00:52:49,621 --> 00:52:52,282
Yeah yeah, I think I have a touch
of what Dad has.

1013
00:52:52,356 --> 00:52:54,346
Oh, sweetheart,
is there burning in your anus?

1014
00:52:54,424 --> 00:52:55,894
Yep yep, just a little bit.

1015
00:52:55,962 --> 00:52:57,826
Well, maybe you need
one of Dad's little orange pills.

1016
00:52:57,896 --> 00:53:00,557
Yeah, you know what?
I'm just gonna let it pass.

1017
00:53:00,631 --> 00:53:01,620
- You sure?
- Yes.

1018
00:53:01,699 --> 00:53:03,533
- That's a good idea.
- Well, all right.

1019
00:53:03,604 --> 00:53:05,230
You know where they are.
Come on, sweetheart,

1020
00:53:05,304 --> 00:53:07,294
follow me with that bundt cake.
Let's go.

1021
00:53:07,372 --> 00:53:09,032
Yeah, we don't want
to keep them waiting.

1022
00:53:09,106 --> 00:53:10,629
I know.

1023
00:53:10,707 --> 00:53:12,645
(whispering)
Get the fuck out of here!

1024
00:53:12,713 --> 00:53:14,407
- Gesundheit.
- Thank you.

1025
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:17,504
(music playing)

1026
00:53:18,649 --> 00:53:20,677
- Here we go.
- Ah, here.

1027
00:53:20,754 --> 00:53:22,482
- (laughs)
- All right.

1028
00:53:22,555 --> 00:53:24,545
Yeah, beautiful beautiful.

1029
00:53:24,623 --> 00:53:26,590
- (water splashes outside)
- Oh.

1030
00:53:26,657 --> 00:53:30,686
Wow. Hogan's got a hell
of a Marco Polo game going on.

1031
00:53:30,763 --> 00:53:33,560
Marco Polo...
it's still popular, isn't it?

1032
00:53:33,632 --> 00:53:35,660
You sit...
you sit there, honey.

1033
00:53:35,737 --> 00:53:38,534
So Barry was telling me
there that...

1034
00:53:38,605 --> 00:53:41,834
you are quite the ambitious,
hard-working employee.

1035
00:53:41,907 --> 00:53:45,073
And you've got quite
the aptitude for the law.

1036
00:53:45,146 --> 00:53:47,272
- That... that's great, Spence.
- Yeah.

1037
00:53:47,347 --> 00:53:49,211
- Here you go, Barry.
- Thanks, Mr. Stack.

1038
00:53:49,282 --> 00:53:51,408
- Yeah.
- (belches)

1039
00:53:51,483 --> 00:53:52,783
- Oh.
- (stomach growling)

1040
00:53:52,854 --> 00:53:56,186
Oh, that sounds like
it's really deep in your cavity, honey.

1041
00:53:56,256 --> 00:53:59,246
- Just give me the pill, honey.
- Ooh.

1042
00:53:59,324 --> 00:54:01,454
(music playing)

1043
00:54:07,332 --> 00:54:10,304
- (whispering) What are you doing?
- I'm in Cougar Club.

1044
00:54:10,371 --> 00:54:11,928
Right, and rule number one
of Cougar Club

1045
00:54:12,005 --> 00:54:13,632
is you don't fucking talk
about Cougar Club!

1046
00:54:13,707 --> 00:54:15,435
Now take her back
to your place.

1047
00:54:15,508 --> 00:54:19,742
# All the beauty in the world #

1048
00:54:19,814 --> 00:54:21,940
# All the beauty
in the world... #

1049
00:54:34,663 --> 00:54:36,926
- (all laughing)
- I'm so glad that we...

1050
00:54:36,998 --> 00:54:39,591
- Hi!
- Amanda.

1051
00:54:39,666 --> 00:54:41,330
- Where were you?
- What are you doing here?

1052
00:54:41,404 --> 00:54:43,166
- What?
- We were supposed to go

1053
00:54:43,238 --> 00:54:45,967
on the horseback ride from
Beachwood Canyon to Glendale.

1054
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:47,472
How could you forget that?

1055
00:54:47,541 --> 00:54:50,638
- It was sunset.
- Oh.

1056
00:54:50,714 --> 00:54:53,840
Yeah, I'm sorry.
I had a meeting here

1057
00:54:53,915 --> 00:54:58,411
with my boss. Mr. Stack,
this is my girlfriend, Amanda.

1058
00:54:58,488 --> 00:55:01,581
Yeah, except you didn't know
I was gonna be here tonight.

1059
00:55:01,657 --> 00:55:03,487
How very nice
to meet you, Amanda.

1060
00:55:03,558 --> 00:55:05,495
I'm Barry Stack.

1061
00:55:05,563 --> 00:55:06,927
Is this true, Spencey?

1062
00:55:06,997 --> 00:55:09,863
It's, um...
what was the question?

1063
00:55:09,932 --> 00:55:13,267
Well, obviously you didn't
invite me to your party.

1064
00:55:13,337 --> 00:55:15,600
I mean, apparently I'm just
a little too young.

1065
00:55:15,672 --> 00:55:17,468
All the women
out there are really old.

1066
00:55:17,539 --> 00:55:20,029
Why are you partying
with a bunch of 50-year-olds?

1067
00:55:20,108 --> 00:55:22,511
Are you into old ladies, Spencey?

1068
00:55:22,580 --> 00:55:24,774
What? No.

1069
00:55:24,848 --> 00:55:26,644
I... I don't know what
she's talking about.

1070
00:55:26,715 --> 00:55:30,483
I-I-I-I-I I don't know... I don't know
how to thank you enough, Barry,

1071
00:55:30,554 --> 00:55:34,011
for this letter of recommendation.
It just means the world to us.

1072
00:55:34,090 --> 00:55:35,852
No thanks necessary, Fred.

1073
00:55:35,924 --> 00:55:37,690
Anyway, after all is said and done,

1074
00:55:37,763 --> 00:55:40,697
I think Spencey's
gonna earn that letter.

1075
00:55:40,765 --> 00:55:43,561
Of course... of course...
of course he is. Of course, of course.

1076
00:55:51,774 --> 00:55:53,837
Let's go. Let's...

1077
00:55:58,481 --> 00:56:00,472
Oh.

1078
00:56:00,549 --> 00:56:02,544
Good night, Spence.

1079
00:56:02,622 --> 00:56:05,248
- Spence, what's going on?
- It's not...

1080
00:56:05,322 --> 00:56:07,186
Isn't she a little old
for Marco Polo?

1081
00:56:07,257 --> 00:56:08,747
Daniela, wait!

1082
00:56:08,825 --> 00:56:11,591
Spence? Spence!

1083
00:56:13,931 --> 00:56:17,366
I had no idea
he would be here, I swear.

1084
00:56:17,434 --> 00:56:18,734
Don't go.

1085
00:56:18,805 --> 00:56:20,863
Spence, I'm sorry.
You're a really nice guy,

1086
00:56:20,939 --> 00:56:22,872
but I don't want
anything here, okay?

1087
00:56:22,940 --> 00:56:25,271
- Come on, can't we just talk about it?
- Good night, Spence.

1088
00:56:25,341 --> 00:56:27,073
What the...?

1089
00:56:27,146 --> 00:56:29,443
You're not over him yet, are you?

1090
00:56:29,514 --> 00:56:30,708
Spence?

1091
00:56:30,782 --> 00:56:33,613
Are you having
a relationship with this old lady?

1092
00:56:35,155 --> 00:56:38,589
Oh my Go... you know, I would
expect this from Hogan, okay?

1093
00:56:38,657 --> 00:56:41,352
He's... he's sick!
But you?

1094
00:56:41,425 --> 00:56:44,260
Amanda, not now, just go home.

1095
00:56:44,330 --> 00:56:46,923
- Daniela, wait!
- (gasps)

1096
00:56:50,334 --> 00:56:52,168
You're a fucker, Spence!

1097
00:57:12,557 --> 00:57:15,495
Good morning, guys.
Your applicants are here.

1098
00:57:15,563 --> 00:57:17,553
(whispering)
What?

1099
00:57:17,631 --> 00:57:19,097
They're not supposed
to come here.

1100
00:57:19,165 --> 00:57:20,757
Thank you very much,
sweetheart.

1101
00:57:20,833 --> 00:57:23,269
I think we can take it from here.
Gentlemen?

1102
00:57:24,672 --> 00:57:27,071
So, tell us why

1103
00:57:27,141 --> 00:57:29,506
you want to be members
of Cougar Club.

1104
00:57:29,575 --> 00:57:32,410
Well, it's like...
I've been fantasizing

1105
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:35,004
about my mom's friends
for a long time.

1106
00:57:36,083 --> 00:57:38,073
- So has he.
- Mm-hmm.

1107
00:57:38,151 --> 00:57:40,213
Right. Welcome.

1108
00:57:41,389 --> 00:57:43,948
- Yeah, okay.
- Thanks.

1109
00:57:44,024 --> 00:57:47,423
- Congratulations.
- Why don't you guys read these over?

1110
00:57:47,496 --> 00:57:49,986
A couple times.
Get the hell out of here.

1111
00:57:57,439 --> 00:58:01,339
That's 345 and 346.
We've more than tripled our membership.

1112
00:58:01,408 --> 00:58:03,637
It's just like you said.

1113
00:58:03,709 --> 00:58:05,805
- La-la-la!
- You know I don't like that.

1114
00:58:05,881 --> 00:58:08,007
- What?
- This, gross.

1115
00:58:08,082 --> 00:58:12,214
So I look at the question and the answer
just seems to pop into my head.

1116
00:58:12,289 --> 00:58:14,848
And I've been here
so many times before,

1117
00:58:14,924 --> 00:58:17,551
- and I go blank, so...
- Oh! Okay okay.

1118
00:58:17,625 --> 00:58:20,653
(clears throat)
Is it a foot?

1119
00:58:20,730 --> 00:58:21,992
Mm-hmm.

1120
00:58:23,933 --> 00:58:26,196
Oh hell no.

1121
00:58:26,267 --> 00:58:28,669
No, try it, it's good.

1122
00:58:28,738 --> 00:58:31,900
Have you tried the toenail?
It's a secret ingredient.

1123
00:58:31,974 --> 00:58:33,838
What the?
What is this?

1124
00:58:33,908 --> 00:58:36,205
Guys, I passed the bar.

1125
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:38,713
- No, you didn't!
- I did.

1126
00:58:38,782 --> 00:58:40,146
Way to go, man.

1127
00:58:40,216 --> 00:58:41,649
(grunts)

1128
00:58:41,716 --> 00:58:43,707
I couldn't have done it
without you guys.

1129
00:58:43,785 --> 00:58:45,483
- Oh.
- Cougar Club...

1130
00:58:45,556 --> 00:58:47,853
I swear...
changed my life.

1131
00:58:47,924 --> 00:58:50,016
- That's sweet, man.
- Isn't he sweet?

1132
00:58:50,092 --> 00:58:52,892
- It's true.
- Oh.

1133
00:58:52,964 --> 00:58:54,363
Hey, okay.

1134
00:58:54,432 --> 00:58:55,864
Okay, all right, Karl.

1135
00:58:55,932 --> 00:58:57,489
(laughs)

1136
00:58:57,566 --> 00:59:00,159
Have some celebratory cake.

1137
00:59:00,235 --> 00:59:03,900
Well well well.
Congratulations, butt-licker.

1138
00:59:03,974 --> 00:59:05,498
Thanks, Mr. Archibald.

1139
00:59:05,575 --> 00:59:07,405
(grunts)

1140
00:59:09,114 --> 00:59:11,877
And your wife.
Thank her for me too.

1141
00:59:12,949 --> 00:59:14,916
Stack:
Attention shit turd

1142
00:59:14,984 --> 00:59:16,712
and shit-turd's friend.

1143
00:59:16,784 --> 00:59:19,381
Put down the fucking snacks
and get in here.

1144
00:59:19,457 --> 00:59:23,516
Oh, and a special congratulations
to douche bag.

1145
00:59:23,592 --> 00:59:26,792
I never thought you'd pass.

1146
00:59:30,367 --> 00:59:32,095
He knew my name.

1147
00:59:37,375 --> 00:59:40,467
(door opens, closes)

1148
01:00:03,301 --> 01:00:05,461
Assignment time.

1149
01:00:05,535 --> 01:00:08,336
I need you shit turds to go
to L Oberman's house with a camera.

1150
01:00:08,408 --> 01:00:10,102
His address is in the folder.

1151
01:00:10,175 --> 01:00:12,506
I have knowledge
he does hookers by the pool

1152
01:00:12,576 --> 01:00:13,944
on Wednesdays at 3:00.

1153
01:00:14,014 --> 01:00:16,243
Take pictures
and bring them back to me.

1154
01:00:16,316 --> 01:00:17,839
Go!

1155
01:00:18,984 --> 01:00:20,507
You are aware, sir...

1156
01:00:20,584 --> 01:00:23,078
Are you speaking to me?

1157
01:00:23,157 --> 01:00:25,954
- It's not what...
- (speaks gibberish)

1158
01:00:34,100 --> 01:00:36,192
Spence?

1159
01:00:36,268 --> 01:00:38,603
By the way, I was wondering
if you were able

1160
01:00:38,673 --> 01:00:41,038
to finish my letter
of recommendation?

1161
01:00:41,108 --> 01:00:43,973
Not yet, shit turd.

1162
01:00:44,042 --> 01:00:47,014
Do you know when you might be
able to finish it? Because I really...

1163
01:00:47,082 --> 01:00:49,379
You'll know when
you're fucking looking at it!

1164
01:00:49,450 --> 01:00:51,781
Okay! Yeah.

1165
01:00:51,851 --> 01:00:54,011
We will know that
when we're looking at it.

1166
01:00:54,086 --> 01:00:55,954
We look forward to that.

1167
01:00:56,024 --> 01:00:58,048
(whispers)
Don't kill the asshole yet.

1168
01:00:58,125 --> 01:00:59,921
(door opens, closes)

1169
01:01:03,199 --> 01:01:06,428
Look what I found
in shit-turd friend's backpack.

1170
01:01:07,767 --> 01:01:09,530
"Cougar Club"?

1171
01:01:09,602 --> 01:01:11,163
Hmm.

1172
01:01:12,774 --> 01:01:15,571
I think our wives
are involved in this.

1173
01:01:15,642 --> 01:01:17,939
(girls hooting, splashing)

1174
01:01:19,915 --> 01:01:21,677
(camera clicking)

1175
01:01:25,251 --> 01:01:28,382
I can't believe she's still in love
with that fucking guy.

1176
01:01:29,624 --> 01:01:31,591
Why won't she call me back?

1177
01:01:31,658 --> 01:01:33,887
Conrad's wife
won't stop calling me.

1178
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:35,158
It's like, "Dude,

1179
01:01:35,232 --> 01:01:37,096
leave me the fuck alone."

1180
01:01:37,166 --> 01:01:38,928
(camera clicking)

1181
01:01:41,335 --> 01:01:44,398
Your mind should be dug out
and studied, man.

1182
01:01:44,474 --> 01:01:46,373
Why?

1183
01:01:46,442 --> 01:01:48,568
I know what I like.

1184
01:01:48,643 --> 01:01:51,910
Oh, ladies, I gotta go
pull on my bow.

1185
01:01:54,016 --> 01:01:55,347
Spence:
What is that?

1186
01:01:55,418 --> 01:02:00,186
That, my friend, is a gold lamé
banana hammock.

1187
01:02:00,257 --> 01:02:01,918
No.

1188
01:02:01,992 --> 01:02:04,982
No, that's a bow and arrow.

1189
01:02:10,300 --> 01:02:12,460
Gardener:
Ay, caramba.

1190
01:02:16,507 --> 01:02:17,996
Oh shit.

1191
01:02:22,010 --> 01:02:24,607
- (boys grunting)
- Who the fuck?

1192
01:02:35,859 --> 01:02:37,689
(groaning)

1193
01:02:42,366 --> 01:02:45,391
Oh, sorry, shit turds.

1194
01:02:45,469 --> 01:02:47,698
I heard you got banged up a little,

1195
01:02:47,769 --> 01:02:51,139
but the firm really appreciates
you going that extra mile.

1196
01:02:51,209 --> 01:02:54,802
And hey, I'll write that letter
of recommendation

1197
01:02:54,877 --> 01:02:56,174
real soon.

1198
01:02:59,517 --> 01:03:00,949
- Everyone's paid up.
- Okay.

1199
01:03:01,017 --> 01:03:02,644
- Cool cool cool.
- Thanks for checking, Karl.

1200
01:03:02,719 --> 01:03:04,310
- You all right?
- Yeah. Ahem.

1201
01:03:07,391 --> 01:03:08,983
Hello, Cougar Club.

1202
01:03:09,060 --> 01:03:11,027
(cheering)

1203
01:03:14,433 --> 01:03:17,924
All right, nice to see you guys
showed up here today.

1204
01:03:18,002 --> 01:03:20,996
Let's talk about it.

1205
01:03:21,074 --> 01:03:22,938
How great was pool party?

1206
01:03:23,008 --> 01:03:25,202
(cheering)

1207
01:03:29,049 --> 01:03:31,811
How about Film-Your-Own-
Threesome Thursdays?

1208
01:03:34,085 --> 01:03:36,644
I'm gonna take it down
a notch here

1209
01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:38,884
because some of you are
a little skittish about this one...

1210
01:03:38,958 --> 01:03:41,187
you're regretting it now...
a little something called

1211
01:03:41,260 --> 01:03:44,921
"Midnight Graveyard
Cougar Hunt."

1212
01:03:49,134 --> 01:03:50,795
Oh yeah!

1213
01:03:50,869 --> 01:03:54,500
All right, all right.
So now, as all of you know,

1214
01:03:54,575 --> 01:03:57,168
September 19th

1215
01:03:57,243 --> 01:04:01,511
is our big Cougar Club extravaganza

1216
01:04:01,583 --> 01:04:03,379
in Beverly Hills.

1217
01:04:03,450 --> 01:04:06,679
That's right.
Okay, guys,

1218
01:04:06,752 --> 01:04:08,878
so it just comes down to this...
simple.

1219
01:04:08,953 --> 01:04:12,050
Don't be pussies,
take care of your cougars,

1220
01:04:12,126 --> 01:04:13,615
'cause they take care of you.

1221
01:04:15,928 --> 01:04:18,866
(all chanting)
Cougar cougar cougar...

1222
01:04:18,934 --> 01:04:22,299
(girl hooting)

1223
01:04:33,512 --> 01:04:35,244
Hello, BMW.

1224
01:04:38,918 --> 01:04:41,283
Nice. A Lexus.

1225
01:04:42,792 --> 01:04:46,624
Ah. Miss Cadillac.
Very nice.

1226
01:04:46,694 --> 01:04:49,752
Ooh. (growls)
Jaguar.

1227
01:04:49,828 --> 01:04:52,595
- Spence: Oh yeah.
- Hogan: Come over and sort you out.

1228
01:04:52,667 --> 01:04:54,793
(growls)

1229
01:04:56,703 --> 01:04:59,368
Oh shit, it's the Trans Am.
Hide me.

1230
01:04:59,442 --> 01:05:01,238
Hey, Hogan.

1231
01:05:01,309 --> 01:05:04,402
Still ain't moving, baby. Yeow!

1232
01:05:04,478 --> 01:05:06,172
Look at that.

1233
01:05:08,351 --> 01:05:10,875
- Hey.
- You know it, I'll show it.

1234
01:05:10,952 --> 01:05:12,418
Whoo!

1235
01:05:14,153 --> 01:05:17,125
- Welcome.
- Guess Daniela didn't come with her.

1236
01:05:17,193 --> 01:05:20,285
Okay, Cameron, pay up.

1237
01:05:20,361 --> 01:05:22,295
ATM's inside.
Here you go.

1238
01:05:22,363 --> 01:05:24,925
Tried to run one by Karl?
Not gonna happen, pal.

1239
01:05:25,001 --> 01:05:26,763
He's got eyes like a hawk.

1240
01:05:28,637 --> 01:05:31,767
Look at her.
Here she comes, there she goes.

1241
01:05:31,842 --> 01:05:34,332
(hip-hop music playing)

1242
01:05:45,020 --> 01:05:46,884
Hey!

1243
01:05:58,935 --> 01:06:02,494
Karl. Karl.
Did you... you swipe this guy in?

1244
01:06:02,570 --> 01:06:04,200
Ooh!

1245
01:06:05,243 --> 01:06:08,369
No, l... no, I don't know
how he got in here.

1246
01:06:08,444 --> 01:06:10,173
- No.
- Cougar crasher.

1247
01:06:10,246 --> 01:06:12,876
(making lewd noises)

1248
01:06:13,918 --> 01:06:16,477
Well, look at you, baby. Hey.

1249
01:06:16,553 --> 01:06:18,520
Um, can I see
your Cougar card?

1250
01:06:18,587 --> 01:06:19,989
Cougar card?

1251
01:06:21,026 --> 01:06:23,458
I'm gonna have to pull him away
for a sec, will you excuse us?

1252
01:06:23,527 --> 01:06:24,516
Sure.

1253
01:06:24,594 --> 01:06:27,027
This is a private party,
and I'm really sorry, members only.

1254
01:06:27,096 --> 01:06:29,033
- You're gonna have to go.
- Come on, man.

1255
01:06:29,101 --> 01:06:33,627
That girl, she wants me.
I can get with her in like five minutes.

1256
01:06:33,704 --> 01:06:36,732
Well, unfortunately,
only members get that chance.

1257
01:06:36,809 --> 01:06:37,969
Members only.

1258
01:06:38,043 --> 01:06:40,374
Well, what do I got to do
to become a member?

1259
01:06:40,445 --> 01:06:44,213
Well, I mean, there's a whole
extensive screening process.

1260
01:06:44,284 --> 01:06:46,979
My partner and I
have to interview you...

1261
01:06:47,052 --> 01:06:48,575
And then if they approve,

1262
01:06:48,653 --> 01:06:52,523
- then you pay a fee of like...
- $3,000 to join,

1263
01:06:52,592 --> 01:06:55,321
and then there is individual fees
for each event.

1264
01:06:55,394 --> 01:06:57,020
Great, I've interviewed.

1265
01:06:57,095 --> 01:07:00,363
I just won like, five grad cash
at one of the Indian casinos.

1266
01:07:00,433 --> 01:07:03,868
I'll slide that your way,
and then I'll be a member.

1267
01:07:03,936 --> 01:07:06,233
Okay.

1268
01:07:06,304 --> 01:07:09,400
- $5,000?
- Come here. Come here!

1269
01:07:09,476 --> 01:07:11,375
- Okay. Okay.
- Okay.

1270
01:07:11,443 --> 01:07:15,401
Let's... just hold on
just a second, Cindy.

1271
01:07:15,480 --> 01:07:16,848
Hold.

1272
01:07:16,917 --> 01:07:19,441
Meet my partner, we'll finish
this transaction, all right?

1273
01:07:19,519 --> 01:07:20,780
- All right.
- Right this way.

1274
01:07:20,853 --> 01:07:23,343
- After you, sir. Please, after you.
- That's fine.

1275
01:07:23,421 --> 01:07:24,914
Attaboy.

1276
01:07:32,630 --> 01:07:35,533
What the hell are you
doing over here, man?

1277
01:07:35,602 --> 01:07:37,899
- I can't fuckin' believe it.
- What?

1278
01:07:37,970 --> 01:07:40,062
Spence:
She's here with him.

1279
01:07:40,138 --> 01:07:42,405
Oh damn.

1280
01:07:42,476 --> 01:07:43,943
I'm so sorry, man.

1281
01:07:44,010 --> 01:07:46,273
Look, just real quick,
I got something I got to ask you.

1282
01:07:46,345 --> 01:07:47,972
- Now?
- Yeah, just two seconds.

1283
01:07:48,046 --> 01:07:51,484
There's this guy here and he's
willing to pay five grand tonight

1284
01:07:51,552 --> 01:07:53,815
to join Cougar Club.
What do you think?

1285
01:07:53,887 --> 01:07:56,218
Spence, what do you think?

1286
01:07:56,288 --> 01:07:58,259
- It's... it's fine.
- Yeah?

1287
01:07:58,326 --> 01:07:59,758
- Yeah.
- Okay, cool.

1288
01:07:59,827 --> 01:08:01,453
Damn, so sorry.

1289
01:08:01,528 --> 01:08:03,052
- Okay.
- Yes, sir.

1290
01:08:03,129 --> 01:08:05,225
- Now look, my friend is busy here.
- Okay.

1291
01:08:05,301 --> 01:08:06,995
Okay?
But he's gonna give you a shot...

1292
01:08:07,068 --> 01:08:08,432
- Oh.
...on this, all right?

1293
01:08:08,502 --> 01:08:10,230
- One shot.
- Wow.

1294
01:08:10,303 --> 01:08:14,072
So... so basically
I give you this...

1295
01:08:14,143 --> 01:08:18,168
5,000 bucks
and I get to go nail that hottie?

1296
01:08:19,345 --> 01:08:22,112
You are a charmer.
Yeah, you get to nail that cougar.

1297
01:08:22,185 --> 01:08:24,482
- Cougar. Eh...
- Cougar.

1298
01:08:24,553 --> 01:08:25,985
Cougar.

1299
01:08:26,053 --> 01:08:27,179
Nice.

1300
01:08:28,588 --> 01:08:30,422
It's there.

1301
01:08:30,493 --> 01:08:33,086
- Welcome to Cougar Club.
- All right.

1302
01:08:33,161 --> 01:08:34,525
Welcome to Cougar Club, man.

1303
01:08:34,595 --> 01:08:35,619
- Ow!
- Hey, what are you...

1304
01:08:35,696 --> 01:08:38,327
- What the hell?
- I'm Detective John Butler.

1305
01:08:38,402 --> 01:08:40,198
You're both under arrest
for pandering.

1306
01:08:40,269 --> 01:08:41,633
- What?
- Beat it, douche bag.

1307
01:08:41,703 --> 01:08:43,192
Oh my... God,
he knew my name!

1308
01:08:43,270 --> 01:08:44,794
Butler: You both have
the right to remain silent.

1309
01:08:44,872 --> 01:08:46,672
- Anything you say...
- Policeman: Turn around.

1310
01:08:46,743 --> 01:08:48,539
...can and will be
used against you.

1311
01:08:48,611 --> 01:08:52,136
- Blah blah blah blah blah...
- No way, not the shit turds.

1312
01:08:52,213 --> 01:08:55,652
Officer, these boys work for me.
Why are they being arrested?

1313
01:08:55,719 --> 01:08:57,117
- Butler: Pandering.
- (Stack gasps)

1314
01:08:57,186 --> 01:08:59,710
Wow, you think
you know people.

1315
01:08:59,788 --> 01:09:02,486
You hear that, honey?
Pandering!

1316
01:09:02,559 --> 01:09:06,517
Should I put that in your
recommendation letter, Spencey?

1317
01:09:08,697 --> 01:09:10,429
Whoo!

1318
01:09:14,537 --> 01:09:17,528
Here's your car, boys!

1319
01:09:19,611 --> 01:09:21,975
Amanda said
if I kept associating with you,

1320
01:09:22,044 --> 01:09:24,137
it would eventually destroy me,
and she was right.

1321
01:09:24,212 --> 01:09:26,077
Oh, so, this is all my fault?

1322
01:09:26,147 --> 01:09:28,084
I did all this by myself?

1323
01:09:28,152 --> 01:09:29,982
'Cause you were there.
You said, "Fine."

1324
01:09:30,053 --> 01:09:32,646
I wasn't even looking at you
when I said it.

1325
01:09:32,722 --> 01:09:35,056
Obviously, I had
other things on my mind.

1326
01:09:35,126 --> 01:09:37,525
Do you not see how much
I lose in this thing?

1327
01:09:37,594 --> 01:09:39,891
Is that not perfectly clear to you?

1328
01:09:39,962 --> 01:09:43,662
Yale? Totally fucked.
My job? Fucked.

1329
01:09:43,736 --> 01:09:45,669
Oh, what, I didn't lose my job?

1330
01:09:45,737 --> 01:09:47,328
- (laughs)
- No, I didn't lose my job?

1331
01:09:47,404 --> 01:09:49,530
Don't even pretend
that meant anything to you,

1332
01:09:49,605 --> 01:09:52,372
because you don't have to
care about anything, Hogan.

1333
01:09:52,444 --> 01:09:54,604
You have no responsibilities,
no obligations,

1334
01:09:54,678 --> 01:09:56,907
no one breathing down your
fucking neck every day of your life

1335
01:09:56,979 --> 01:09:59,109
demanding you do something
acceptable so their friends

1336
01:09:59,184 --> 01:10:01,617
won't think badly of them
when they're asked about you.

1337
01:10:01,686 --> 01:10:03,278
You don't even live
in your own house.

1338
01:10:03,353 --> 01:10:04,911
- You know what your problem is?
- What?

1339
01:10:04,988 --> 01:10:06,545
You're a fucking pussy, Spence. Yeah.

1340
01:10:06,622 --> 01:10:09,856
You let people breathe down your neck
and tell you what you should feel

1341
01:10:09,928 --> 01:10:13,226
and what you should be and
what you should do with your life.

1342
01:10:13,297 --> 01:10:15,564
My advice:
Grow up, and be a man.

1343
01:10:15,635 --> 01:10:17,727
All right, you know what?
I'm done.

1344
01:10:20,438 --> 01:10:23,132
Uh, hey...

1345
01:10:23,205 --> 01:10:26,871
You know, I've always,
I've always wondered

1346
01:10:26,946 --> 01:10:30,277
what it would be like to have
my dick in a man.

1347
01:10:30,347 --> 01:10:32,181
(laughs)

1348
01:10:33,886 --> 01:10:37,082
(siren wails)

1349
01:10:52,538 --> 01:10:54,596
I can explain.

1350
01:10:56,978 --> 01:10:58,945
Just get in.

1351
01:11:08,821 --> 01:11:10,913
Come on, let's go.

1352
01:11:10,989 --> 01:11:13,517
You, stay.

1353
01:11:37,953 --> 01:11:41,046
Man on TV:
So goodbye, Susie. Goodbye.

1354
01:11:41,122 --> 01:11:42,816
- Jack.
- Goodbye.

1355
01:11:42,889 --> 01:11:45,019
Jack, please.

1356
01:11:45,094 --> 01:11:47,653
Jack! Don't do this.

1357
01:11:53,236 --> 01:11:55,533
All right, Will,
what do you have for me?

1358
01:11:55,604 --> 01:11:59,060
Will:
Next, State of California versus Holmes

1359
01:11:59,139 --> 01:12:01,235
and Hogan III.

1360
01:12:14,655 --> 01:12:17,054
Representing ourselves, are we?

1361
01:12:39,648 --> 01:12:41,080
Uh-huh.

1362
01:12:41,148 --> 01:12:42,709
You're late, counsel.

1363
01:12:42,786 --> 01:12:44,378
Yes. Yes, uh...

1364
01:12:44,455 --> 01:12:46,388
How do your clients plead?

1365
01:12:46,456 --> 01:12:48,787
I think I have that.

1366
01:12:48,857 --> 01:12:50,725
Uh, just...

1367
01:12:50,795 --> 01:12:52,056
- Not guilty, dude.
- Not guilty.

1368
01:12:52,129 --> 01:12:54,153
Not guilty, dude.

1369
01:12:55,364 --> 01:12:57,524
Very well.

1370
01:12:57,598 --> 01:13:00,502
Your court date will be set for...

1371
01:13:01,839 --> 01:13:04,567
three weeks from today...

1372
01:13:04,639 --> 01:13:06,042
dude.

1373
01:13:06,112 --> 01:13:07,635
- (bangs gavel)
- Next.

1374
01:13:13,181 --> 01:13:15,914
Hey... hey, don't worry.

1375
01:13:15,987 --> 01:13:17,613
I've done all the research.

1376
01:13:17,688 --> 01:13:21,986
I think I can convince
the judge to drop the charges.

1377
01:13:22,057 --> 01:13:24,551
See?

1378
01:13:24,629 --> 01:13:26,926
Karl, your shoes don't match.

1379
01:13:28,965 --> 01:13:30,765
Oh, fuck!

1380
01:13:30,836 --> 01:13:33,133
I hope the judge didn't notice.

1381
01:13:33,204 --> 01:13:35,137
Oh shit.
I've gotta get back to work.

1382
01:13:35,205 --> 01:13:36,899
Archibald's gonna be on my ass.

1383
01:13:36,973 --> 01:13:39,501
Uh, bye.
I'll see you later, Hogan.

1384
01:13:41,013 --> 01:13:43,912
Ah!
Ha-ha! Hee-hee!

1385
01:13:43,981 --> 01:13:46,073
Think he was
a wise choice for an attorney?

1386
01:13:46,149 --> 01:13:48,120
- He's a free choice.
- Yeah.

1387
01:13:48,187 --> 01:13:50,017
See, it won't close.
That's the problem.

1388
01:13:52,023 --> 01:13:54,285
- So how are you?
- Good.

1389
01:13:54,357 --> 01:13:58,659
Yeah, I'm moving in
with Amanda this weekend.

1390
01:13:58,730 --> 01:14:00,163
- Really?
- Yeah.

1391
01:14:00,231 --> 01:14:02,528
She's been really supportive.

1392
01:14:02,599 --> 01:14:04,069
- Wow.
- Yeah.

1393
01:14:05,104 --> 01:14:08,664
- Is that really what you want?
- I don't know, Hogan.

1394
01:14:08,740 --> 01:14:12,940
I need to go to law school
and get something going with my life.

1395
01:14:13,013 --> 01:14:15,207
- Yeah, well...
- Yeah.

1396
01:14:15,281 --> 01:14:17,407
Bye, Hogan.

1397
01:14:23,956 --> 01:14:26,048
(cheering on TV)

1398
01:14:34,199 --> 01:14:35,500
Hey, Karl.

1399
01:14:35,571 --> 01:14:36,901
Hey.

1400
01:14:45,112 --> 01:14:47,170
Another one of those
in the freezer?

1401
01:14:47,247 --> 01:14:49,180
Yeah, the Salisbury steak,
it's all yours.

1402
01:14:49,248 --> 01:14:51,776
Nice distance.

1403
01:15:01,996 --> 01:15:06,056
So did the three-headed monster give you
any shit about taking a long lunch?

1404
01:15:06,131 --> 01:15:07,723
- (beeps)
- Karl: No.

1405
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:09,737
There was other stuff going on.

1406
01:15:12,973 --> 01:15:14,997
What other stuff?

1407
01:15:15,074 --> 01:15:17,409
What, they know...
they know you're a member?

1408
01:15:17,479 --> 01:15:19,412
- No.
- What?

1409
01:15:19,480 --> 01:15:22,073
No way. They know about you
and Archibald's wife?

1410
01:15:22,148 --> 01:15:25,348
No, they know about you
and Conrad's wife.

1411
01:15:25,421 --> 01:15:26,785
- Shut up.
- Yeah.

1412
01:15:28,789 --> 01:15:31,052
Yeah, I heard him say
he's gonna divorce her,

1413
01:15:31,124 --> 01:15:33,721
and then he spent the rest
of the day trying to find out

1414
01:15:33,796 --> 01:15:35,956
if you owned a car.

1415
01:15:36,031 --> 01:15:37,395
And when he found out
you didn't,

1416
01:15:37,465 --> 01:15:39,762
he said it was a good thing,
'cause if you did, he'd find it,

1417
01:15:39,833 --> 01:15:41,929
plant a bomb in it,
and quote,

1418
01:15:42,005 --> 01:15:43,904
"blow you beyond
dental records."

1419
01:15:43,972 --> 01:15:45,768
He said that?

1420
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:47,636
- Uh-huh.
- (laughs)

1421
01:15:47,707 --> 01:15:50,042
Well, that's a fucking bona fide
terrorist threat,

1422
01:15:50,113 --> 01:15:51,943
punishable by like, 25 years.

1423
01:15:52,014 --> 01:15:54,311
I don't know. I could look it up.
I don't know.

1424
01:15:54,382 --> 01:15:56,212
Think you could get him
to say it again?

1425
01:15:56,283 --> 01:15:57,914
I don't know.

1426
01:15:57,988 --> 01:16:01,080
No, I know you don't know, but if I sent
you in there with a body wire,

1427
01:16:01,156 --> 01:16:04,056
you could provoke him into
repeating it, couldn't you, Karl?

1428
01:16:04,125 --> 01:16:06,619
Oh God. I don't know.
I mean...

1429
01:16:06,697 --> 01:16:08,789
you know what?
Okay, I want to, but l...

1430
01:16:08,865 --> 01:16:10,627
Karl, don't help me, okay?

1431
01:16:10,699 --> 01:16:12,563
Fuck me,
this is about the club.

1432
01:16:12,633 --> 01:16:14,968
Where would you be without the club,
Karl? I'll tell you where you'd be:

1433
01:16:15,039 --> 01:16:17,063
You're be fucking files
Q through R.

1434
01:16:17,140 --> 01:16:18,663
Don't go back there.

1435
01:16:18,740 --> 01:16:21,041
The paper cuts haven't even
healed yet, have they?

1436
01:16:22,680 --> 01:16:24,977
No. Come on.

1437
01:16:25,048 --> 01:16:28,016
From the top rope, baby.
Top ropes.

1438
01:16:28,083 --> 01:16:29,178
Yes!

1439
01:16:29,254 --> 01:16:31,847
- (knocks on door)
- Stack: Come in!

1440
01:16:38,730 --> 01:16:41,789
Uh, hello, Mr. Stack.

1441
01:16:41,865 --> 01:16:45,094
- Mr. Conrad, Mr. Archibald.
- (curtain remote beeping)

1442
01:16:45,167 --> 01:16:47,035
What do you want, douche bag?

1443
01:16:47,105 --> 01:16:49,197
May I...

1444
01:16:49,273 --> 01:16:52,002
you know...

1445
01:16:53,075 --> 01:16:55,603
How do you... how do you do this?
I don't know.

1446
01:16:55,680 --> 01:16:57,704
- Ah... oh!
- (door closes)

1447
01:16:57,781 --> 01:17:00,715
All right, there we go.

1448
01:17:00,783 --> 01:17:04,619
Hmm, um...
I just couldn't help but hear

1449
01:17:04,689 --> 01:17:07,156
your conversation yesterday about

1450
01:17:07,224 --> 01:17:09,855
Marshall Hogan and how he,

1451
01:17:09,930 --> 01:17:11,658
you know,
did stuff with your wife.

1452
01:17:11,731 --> 01:17:13,630
What did you say about my wife?
You don't understand!

1453
01:17:13,698 --> 01:17:15,790
- (squealing)
- Huh? I will rip your dick off

1454
01:17:15,866 --> 01:17:18,337
and shove it up your ass!
You hear me, you scrawny little bastard?

1455
01:17:18,405 --> 01:17:19,666
No, I'm on your side.

1456
01:17:19,739 --> 01:17:22,400
Let's hear what
the butt-licker has to say.

1457
01:17:26,913 --> 01:17:28,402
(feedback)

1458
01:17:28,481 --> 01:17:30,710
- Speak, Karl.
- Okay.

1459
01:17:30,782 --> 01:17:34,413
Well... I saw him this morning.

1460
01:17:34,488 --> 01:17:36,751
So I couldn't help but notice
that he had...

1461
01:17:36,822 --> 01:17:40,587
he was driving
this '91 convertible Camaro

1462
01:17:40,658 --> 01:17:44,152
that was red. And so I said,
you know, "Hey, nice car."

1463
01:17:44,231 --> 01:17:45,891
And he said, you know,
"Hell... uh, thank you.

1464
01:17:45,965 --> 01:17:48,057
Yeah, it's brand new,
I just got it today."

1465
01:17:48,133 --> 01:17:51,901
So, on impulse,
I then took out my work pen...

1466
01:17:51,972 --> 01:17:54,166
which I brought back...

1467
01:17:54,240 --> 01:17:56,434
and I wrote down
his license plate number

1468
01:17:56,508 --> 01:17:59,036
while he was driving away,
because you said

1469
01:17:59,113 --> 01:18:03,707
that if he owned a car,
you would...

1470
01:18:03,783 --> 01:18:06,410
oh darn, what was it?

1471
01:18:06,484 --> 01:18:08,853
What... what did you say?
I ca... I can't remember.

1472
01:18:08,923 --> 01:18:12,049
I said I'd put a bomb in it
and blow him up beyond dental records.

1473
01:18:12,124 --> 01:18:14,557
Get to the fuckin' point, Karl!

1474
01:18:14,626 --> 01:18:18,189
I just thought you should know
that he owns a car now.

1475
01:18:18,265 --> 01:18:20,698
And that...

1476
01:18:20,766 --> 01:18:23,397
this is his...

1477
01:18:23,472 --> 01:18:26,769
license plate number
and current address.

1478
01:18:26,840 --> 01:18:29,433
How nice of you, butt-licker.

1479
01:18:29,508 --> 01:18:31,911
- Way to look out for the team.
- Oh.

1480
01:18:31,980 --> 01:18:34,072
Oh, thank you, Mr. Stack.

1481
01:18:38,150 --> 01:18:40,553
- Yes.
- Hey, shit turd?

1482
01:18:40,622 --> 01:18:43,055
Why so forthcoming?

1483
01:18:43,124 --> 01:18:45,921
Uh-oh. Uh, well,

1484
01:18:45,992 --> 01:18:50,657
you know, my mom,
she used to cheat on my father

1485
01:18:50,731 --> 01:18:52,164
- constantly.
- Fucking slut.

1486
01:18:52,233 --> 01:18:54,825
No, she...
okay, all right, yeah.

1487
01:18:54,900 --> 01:18:57,167
She... and I want, uh...

1488
01:18:57,239 --> 01:19:00,105
I don't want anyone to have to
suffer that kind of indignity,

1489
01:19:00,174 --> 01:19:04,636
be it you, Mr. Stack, or Mr. Conrad,
or for that matter,

1490
01:19:04,714 --> 01:19:07,238
Mr. Archibald.
So... ah!

1491
01:19:07,316 --> 01:19:10,181
Ah! Ow, oh!

1492
01:19:10,250 --> 01:19:12,346
Conrad:
Go fuck yourself, Karl!

1493
01:19:12,422 --> 01:19:13,787
Thank you.

1494
01:19:17,325 --> 01:19:19,292
That's lunch.

1495
01:19:19,359 --> 01:19:21,091
All-you-can-eat sushi,
strip bar.

1496
01:19:21,164 --> 01:19:22,324
In.

1497
01:19:25,067 --> 01:19:27,330
Thanks for letting us
use your car.

1498
01:19:27,401 --> 01:19:31,430
I promise, bomb squad'll reverse
anything before it explodes.

1499
01:19:31,508 --> 01:19:33,441
Oh, that's okay, baby.

1500
01:19:33,509 --> 01:19:36,140
I'm just glad
I could be of some help.

1501
01:19:36,213 --> 01:19:38,010
That's my Gladys.

1502
01:19:38,082 --> 01:19:40,208
It's good to see you.

1503
01:19:40,283 --> 01:19:42,011
You too, Marshall.

1504
01:19:44,222 --> 01:19:47,121
Now, no bombs have
been promised here, okay?

1505
01:19:47,190 --> 01:19:48,851
I just delivered
the information.

1506
01:19:48,925 --> 01:19:51,448
There's no guarantee
they're gonna use it at all.

1507
01:19:51,526 --> 01:19:55,465
I mean, the whole threat
can be a threat, and...

1508
01:19:55,533 --> 01:19:58,159
- holy shit!
- (tires screech)

1509
01:19:58,233 --> 01:20:00,030
Fuck! They're here.

1510
01:20:00,101 --> 01:20:01,504
They're here. Fuck fuck!

1511
01:20:01,573 --> 01:20:04,166
Look at this, fuck!
Oh my fucking God.

1512
01:20:04,241 --> 01:20:06,833
My God. Oh my...

1513
01:20:06,909 --> 01:20:08,501
Look at that fucking... look.

1514
01:20:08,577 --> 01:20:10,878
- Holy shit.
- Stack: Go go go.

1515
01:20:10,949 --> 01:20:15,213
Karl:
Oh my God. I am gonna shit my pants.

1516
01:20:15,285 --> 01:20:16,915
Oh!

1517
01:20:16,989 --> 01:20:20,047
No, Lord! They meant it!
They actually meant it!

1518
01:20:20,124 --> 01:20:22,250
(Hogan whispers)
Shh! Of course they meant it.

1519
01:20:22,325 --> 01:20:25,229
You ever see what happens to people
in the divorce who aren't their clients?

1520
01:20:25,298 --> 01:20:27,595
- Now calm your shit down.
- Gladys: There are two of them.

1521
01:20:27,666 --> 01:20:30,259
No no no, I think
that one's a monkey or something.

1522
01:20:30,334 --> 01:20:32,426
You think it's Mr. Stack
and Mr. Conrad?

1523
01:20:32,502 --> 01:20:35,064
- They might have hired people.
- Circus people.

1524
01:20:35,140 --> 01:20:37,437
Yeah.

1525
01:20:39,509 --> 01:20:42,447
Oh, they're highly organized.

1526
01:20:42,515 --> 01:20:45,381
(sirens wailing)

1527
01:20:45,450 --> 01:20:47,542
(guns cocking)

1528
01:20:47,618 --> 01:20:49,248
Freeze, you little freak!

1529
01:20:49,323 --> 01:20:51,620
- (all sigh)
- They got 'em.

1530
01:20:51,691 --> 01:20:54,090
- You're going down!
- (laughing)

1531
01:20:54,159 --> 01:20:56,558
I swear to God
I'll blow your brains out!

1532
01:20:56,627 --> 01:20:58,723
(Dolly mumbles)

1533
01:20:58,799 --> 01:21:00,425
Ah!

1534
01:21:00,499 --> 01:21:02,966
Hey, don't move there!

1535
01:21:03,034 --> 01:21:05,092
I had no...
l... I didn't call them.

1536
01:21:05,169 --> 01:21:08,368
Oh yeah, that's the baby.

1537
01:21:08,441 --> 01:21:11,102
- Don't do it!
- Down down down down down!

1538
01:21:11,176 --> 01:21:12,972
Gun down! Right now!

1539
01:21:20,951 --> 01:21:22,320
- (tears)
- Shit!

1540
01:21:23,390 --> 01:21:24,948
Mommy.

1541
01:21:25,025 --> 01:21:28,083
- Down down down down down!
- Ah!

1542
01:21:29,693 --> 01:21:32,358
Down down down down down!

1543
01:21:41,141 --> 01:21:43,005
Amanda:
Spencey, will you get that?

1544
01:21:43,075 --> 01:21:45,372
I'm on the phone
with the wedding planner.

1545
01:21:47,181 --> 01:21:49,307
Hold on a second, Rita.
Spence?

1546
01:21:49,383 --> 01:21:51,612
I thought he didn't
have our address.

1547
01:21:51,684 --> 01:21:53,083
- Please, just...
- I want him gone.

1548
01:21:53,152 --> 01:21:54,281
- Okay.
- I mean it!

1549
01:21:54,356 --> 01:21:57,153
- Okay!
- Sorry. Mom gave me the address.

1550
01:21:57,225 --> 01:22:00,124
I... figured she would.

1551
01:22:00,192 --> 01:22:01,853
Hi.

1552
01:22:01,927 --> 01:22:03,454
Thanks. Oh.

1553
01:22:08,601 --> 01:22:11,368
- Really?
- Yeah.

1554
01:22:11,440 --> 01:22:14,465
She's thrilled.
It's really...

1555
01:22:14,542 --> 01:22:16,475
it's a dream come true.

1556
01:22:16,543 --> 01:22:19,310
- Well, congratulations, Spence.
- Thanks.

1557
01:22:19,382 --> 01:22:21,814
Red roses? No no, nobody said
anything about red roses.

1558
01:22:21,883 --> 01:22:24,680
I want perfect white calla lilies.

1559
01:22:24,751 --> 01:22:27,154
Write it down!

1560
01:22:27,223 --> 01:22:29,816
- And I'm going to law school.
- Really? That's great.

1561
01:22:29,892 --> 01:22:32,451
Yeah, Baker accepted me a while ago,
so I'm gonna go.

1562
01:22:32,527 --> 01:22:33,891
I mean, it's not Yale,

1563
01:22:33,960 --> 01:22:35,828
but hey, my dad understands

1564
01:22:35,899 --> 01:22:38,366
- and Amanda's all for it.
- Yeah.

1565
01:22:38,434 --> 01:22:41,799
Well, I'll get out of you two
lovebirds' hair in just a minute,

1566
01:22:41,868 --> 01:22:44,362
but l... I just wanted
to see your face

1567
01:22:44,441 --> 01:22:46,271
when I showed you this.

1568
01:22:54,450 --> 01:22:56,213
(whispers)
No way.

1569
01:22:56,285 --> 01:22:58,377
And get...

1570
01:22:58,453 --> 01:23:01,481
get this...
they searched Conrad's desk.

1571
01:23:01,558 --> 01:23:03,752
They found one
of our Cougar Club folders.

1572
01:23:03,826 --> 01:23:06,760
Those bastards knew about
our extravaganza all along.

1573
01:23:06,828 --> 01:23:08,594
The whole thing was a setup.

1574
01:23:08,666 --> 01:23:10,496
Oh my gosh.
What does Karl say?

1575
01:23:10,567 --> 01:23:12,431
Well, in light
of what's happened,

1576
01:23:12,501 --> 01:23:14,365
he's arranged a little meeting
with Judge Emerson

1577
01:23:14,435 --> 01:23:17,464
to review our case.
And he wants to talk with us right now.

1578
01:23:20,176 --> 01:23:22,938
Everything's gonna be fine.

1579
01:23:23,010 --> 01:23:25,277
Hey, I'll call you back.

1580
01:23:25,349 --> 01:23:27,248
Hi. Hey.

1581
01:23:27,317 --> 01:23:28,875
- Hey.
- Where the hell are you going?

1582
01:23:28,952 --> 01:23:31,680
I... just gotta go meet my lawyer.

1583
01:23:31,753 --> 01:23:32,781
With him?

1584
01:23:32,858 --> 01:23:35,121
- Well, yeah.
- I...

1585
01:23:36,459 --> 01:23:39,086
Spence, I thought
we talked about this.

1586
01:23:39,161 --> 01:23:42,360
If you want to be married to me,
then no more Hogan...

1587
01:23:42,433 --> 01:23:43,627
permanently!

1588
01:23:43,701 --> 01:23:46,134
(mutters)
Fuck you, bitch.

1589
01:23:46,202 --> 01:23:47,896
(chuckling)

1590
01:23:50,275 --> 01:23:52,208
- Oh.
- (Amanda chuckles)

1591
01:23:52,276 --> 01:23:55,039
Mwah!

1592
01:23:55,111 --> 01:23:56,809
I'm sorry, Amanda.

1593
01:23:56,883 --> 01:23:59,612
I mean, l... I never even
asked you to marry me.

1594
01:23:59,683 --> 01:24:01,776
Here.

1595
01:24:03,820 --> 01:24:06,382
Wait.

1596
01:24:06,458 --> 01:24:09,984
But wait, Spence, but...
you complete me!

1597
01:24:10,060 --> 01:24:12,463
- God, I almost did that, didn't I?
- Yeah.

1598
01:24:12,533 --> 01:24:15,762
Shake it off, brother. The bullet
to the forehead's been dodged.

1599
01:24:15,834 --> 01:24:19,632
Spence! Come back! Ahh!

1600
01:24:19,702 --> 01:24:22,230
So what's the deal
with this judge?

1601
01:24:22,308 --> 01:24:25,606
Margaret Emerson.
You saw her at the plea hearing.

1602
01:24:25,677 --> 01:24:28,439
She's a nasty one,
real ball-breaker type.

1603
01:24:28,511 --> 01:24:33,177
But when she heard about
the recent arrest at the law firm,

1604
01:24:33,251 --> 01:24:35,514
the almost-certain setup
at the hotel,

1605
01:24:35,586 --> 01:24:37,489
she seemed intrigued.

1606
01:24:37,558 --> 01:24:39,115
- Oh.
- (stomach growling)

1607
01:24:39,192 --> 01:24:40,819
Oh shit.

1608
01:24:40,893 --> 01:24:43,122
Excuse me, I've gotta...

1609
01:24:43,195 --> 01:24:46,189
um, you know what?
If she comes in,

1610
01:24:46,266 --> 01:24:49,393
just tell her I'll be right back, okay?

1611
01:24:51,770 --> 01:24:53,673
- (Karl farting)
- Karl, man.

1612
01:24:53,741 --> 01:24:56,106
That's coming
from your anal cavity.

1613
01:24:56,176 --> 01:24:58,336
Just take an orange pill,
it's in the briefcase.

1614
01:24:58,411 --> 01:25:01,678
No, that's okay.
It's gonna be the last time.

1615
01:25:14,026 --> 01:25:17,863
Spencer Holmes
and Marshall Hogan III.

1616
01:25:17,933 --> 01:25:20,365
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

1617
01:25:22,402 --> 01:25:24,335
Sit down.

1618
01:25:44,425 --> 01:25:46,359
So...

1619
01:25:46,426 --> 01:25:49,588
I'm supposed to believe
that you two punks

1620
01:25:49,662 --> 01:25:51,394
started a club

1621
01:25:51,467 --> 01:25:56,061
so you could hook up
with old broads like me.

1622
01:25:56,136 --> 01:25:58,733
Well, are there really
any other broads to hook up with?

1623
01:25:58,808 --> 01:26:00,604
(both chuckle)

1624
01:26:00,676 --> 01:26:04,405
Your Honor?
May I call you Margaret?

1625
01:26:04,478 --> 01:26:07,746
Margaret, I'm looking
at you right now

1626
01:26:07,817 --> 01:26:09,909
and all I want to do

1627
01:26:09,985 --> 01:26:12,611
is just jump over this table

1628
01:26:12,686 --> 01:26:15,419
and go to town.
I mean, you are a goddess,

1629
01:26:15,492 --> 01:26:17,550
and I'm sorry if I'm, like,
overstepping the bounds

1630
01:26:17,626 --> 01:26:18,957
of polite society here,

1631
01:26:19,028 --> 01:26:22,052
but I would make love to you
all day and all night,

1632
01:26:22,129 --> 01:26:25,067
until you screamed
with an unbearable ecstasy

1633
01:26:25,135 --> 01:26:26,795
- like you've never felt before.
- And we, we...

1634
01:26:26,869 --> 01:26:28,927
we want to be very clear.
In no way did we ever

1635
01:26:29,003 --> 01:26:31,566
exchange money
for sex in our organization.

1636
01:26:31,642 --> 01:26:35,303
We charged membership fees.
No different than, uh, meetmart. Net

1637
01:26:35,377 --> 01:26:37,606
or Christdate. Net for that matter.

1638
01:26:37,679 --> 01:26:40,150
It's just that our target
was a little more specific,

1639
01:26:40,217 --> 01:26:41,547
- one could say.
- Margaret,

1640
01:26:41,618 --> 01:26:43,050
I'm gonna venture a guess here.

1641
01:26:43,118 --> 01:26:45,608
If I were to come around this table
and gently caress

1642
01:26:45,687 --> 01:26:48,682
the back of your neck
with my tongue...

1643
01:26:50,026 --> 01:26:52,585
a slight chill would
run down your spine?

1644
01:26:52,661 --> 01:26:54,719
Might.

1645
01:26:54,796 --> 01:26:56,767
Wow. Ma'am,
this is no pimp operation.

1646
01:26:56,834 --> 01:26:58,460
- No ma'am, no ma'am.
- We assure you, it's...

1647
01:26:58,535 --> 01:27:01,230
No ma'am, we're bona fide businessmen
with a goal to expand our website

1648
01:27:01,303 --> 01:27:03,740
which... yes, we have a website now.

1649
01:27:03,809 --> 01:27:05,639
Eventually we plan
to have a magazine

1650
01:27:05,710 --> 01:27:07,301
and then we'll tour
around the country,

1651
01:27:07,377 --> 01:27:09,674
branching out to all
the major metropolitan areas,

1652
01:27:09,745 --> 01:27:11,841
all so that we can
become acquainted

1653
01:27:11,917 --> 01:27:13,611
with women such as yourself.

1654
01:27:13,684 --> 01:27:16,277
So sublime, so lush,

1655
01:27:16,353 --> 01:27:18,786
- seasoned, exquisite.
- Really?

1656
01:27:18,854 --> 01:27:20,018
Yeah.

1657
01:27:20,092 --> 01:27:22,582
What about your partner?
Does he feel the same way?

1658
01:27:22,660 --> 01:27:24,456
This guy?

1659
01:27:24,527 --> 01:27:26,653
This guy. Oh my God.
And then some.

1660
01:27:26,729 --> 01:27:29,257
Yeah. Ha.

1661
01:27:29,334 --> 01:27:31,528
Prove it.

1662
01:27:33,004 --> 01:27:35,130
What... oh.

1663
01:27:53,459 --> 01:27:55,483
Woman:
#You drink whiskey #

1664
01:27:55,560 --> 01:27:58,892
# But I drink wine #

1665
01:28:01,235 --> 01:28:05,533
# You wear the watch,
but I keep the time #

1666
01:28:09,810 --> 01:28:12,538
# You're so delicious #

1667
01:28:12,611 --> 01:28:16,743
# But I'm tasty, yeah #

1668
01:28:18,585 --> 01:28:21,552
# You may be fine #

1669
01:28:21,620 --> 01:28:26,525
- (moaning)
- # But I'm sexy, baby #

1670
01:28:26,593 --> 01:28:31,654
# You may be fine,
but I'm sexy #

1671
01:28:31,730 --> 01:28:36,327
# You may be cute, but I'm sexy #

1672
01:28:36,402 --> 01:28:40,235
# You may be pretty,
but I'm sexy #

1673
01:28:40,305 --> 01:28:44,175
# But I'm sexy,
but I'm... #

1674
01:28:44,244 --> 01:28:48,910
# You may be fine,
but I'm sexy #

1675
01:28:48,984 --> 01:28:50,075
# You may be cute... #

1676
01:28:50,151 --> 01:28:51,845
Hogan:
Congratulations, Karl.

1677
01:28:51,919 --> 01:28:54,751
A few more cases, you can actually
get a car from the 21st century.

1678
01:28:54,821 --> 01:28:56,720
Yeah!
And a new bike.

1679
01:28:56,788 --> 01:28:58,190
- Stop the car, stop the car.
- What?

1680
01:28:58,259 --> 01:28:59,920
- Why? Why?
- Hmm?

1681
01:28:59,994 --> 01:29:03,325
- Oh.
- Mm-hmm.

1682
01:29:05,468 --> 01:29:08,095
- I'm not gonna waste gas.
- Just give me one second.

1683
01:29:08,169 --> 01:29:09,999
- Karl: Okay.
- Hogan: Let us dream.

1684
01:29:11,038 --> 01:29:12,629
Hey.

1685
01:29:16,678 --> 01:29:18,941
I'm sorry that I haven't
returned your phone calls.

1686
01:29:19,012 --> 01:29:21,575
I... I've just been swamped

1687
01:29:21,651 --> 01:29:23,777
with getting my real estate license.

1688
01:29:23,853 --> 01:29:27,287
It's great to see you.
I didn't know if I ever would again.

1689
01:29:27,354 --> 01:29:29,150
I'm glad you're okay.

1690
01:29:29,222 --> 01:29:31,159
Yeah yeah.

1691
01:29:31,227 --> 01:29:34,923
We're having a party
Saturday night, if you're interested.

1692
01:29:34,996 --> 01:29:38,195
It's at 8:00. I'd love to see you.

1693
01:29:39,802 --> 01:29:41,269
Yeah.

1694
01:29:41,337 --> 01:29:43,304
Sounds good.

1695
01:29:43,371 --> 01:29:44,962
Good.

1696
01:29:45,038 --> 01:29:46,975
Maybe.

1697
01:29:48,811 --> 01:29:50,539
Okay, bye.

1698
01:29:55,919 --> 01:29:58,785
(woman vocalizing)

1699
01:30:02,593 --> 01:30:04,025
# Let's go... #

1700
01:30:06,195 --> 01:30:08,788
All:
Whoa!

1701
01:30:08,863 --> 01:30:11,164
Here we go, here we go.

1702
01:30:13,904 --> 01:30:15,837
- Whoa.
- Nice nice.

1703
01:30:15,905 --> 01:30:18,967
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah. Ho.

1704
01:30:19,043 --> 01:30:22,478
To Stack, Conrad
and Archibald.

1705
01:30:22,546 --> 01:30:24,945
- (hoots)
- Cheers!

1706
01:30:25,014 --> 01:30:26,678
Bastards.

1707
01:30:27,718 --> 01:30:30,379
- To Cougar Club!
- Cheers!

1708
01:30:30,453 --> 01:30:32,147
- Oh!
- Whoo!

1709
01:30:32,221 --> 01:30:34,017
- Cougar Club!
- Damn it, Karl.

1710
01:30:36,394 --> 01:30:38,588
I'm feeling it. Mmm!

1711
01:30:42,198 --> 01:30:43,862
Take a look around.

1712
01:30:43,936 --> 01:30:47,700
This is what can happen
when you dare to say yes.

1713
01:30:48,872 --> 01:30:50,900
Couldn't have done it
without you.

1714
01:30:52,945 --> 01:30:55,844
True, man. There's so many
ways to say yes.

1715
01:30:55,912 --> 01:30:59,078
Yeah, uh-huh, yep,

1716
01:30:59,152 --> 01:31:01,415
all right, okay, sure.

1717
01:31:01,486 --> 01:31:03,009
It's not even
like foreign languages.

1718
01:31:03,087 --> 01:31:04,145
Hey, Karl. Drink up.

1719
01:31:04,222 --> 01:31:05,848
Thanks, buddy.

1720
01:31:08,994 --> 01:31:12,019
I can't believe it.
She's here.

1721
01:31:14,731 --> 01:31:16,725
- Go go go.
- I'll be right back.

1722
01:31:16,803 --> 01:31:19,827
# Let's go,
let's go dancing #

1723
01:31:19,904 --> 01:31:22,201
# Let's go running... #

1724
01:31:22,272 --> 01:31:25,335
I am so happy
that you're here.

1725
01:31:25,411 --> 01:31:27,503
I wouldn't have missed it.

1726
01:31:27,579 --> 01:31:30,069
# Let's go dancing #

1727
01:31:30,147 --> 01:31:32,743
- # Let's go running #
- (Marshall cackling)

1728
01:31:32,819 --> 01:31:35,946
# Let's go #

1729
01:31:36,021 --> 01:31:39,386
- Whoa!
- Cougar Club!

1730
01:31:39,456 --> 01:31:41,325
(all cheer)

1731
01:31:42,495 --> 01:31:46,520
Oh my boys,
I'm so proud of both of you.

1732
01:31:46,597 --> 01:31:49,262
This is what
you've worked so hard for,

1733
01:31:49,336 --> 01:31:51,462
and I know it's what
you've always wanted.

1734
01:31:51,537 --> 01:31:53,527
- Oh.
- Oh, thanks, Mom.

1735
01:31:53,605 --> 01:31:57,441
- Thanks, Mom.
- Good luck, boys.

1736
01:31:57,511 --> 01:31:59,637
Eh, now you're men.

1737
01:31:59,712 --> 01:32:01,269
Go and be wise.

1738
01:32:01,346 --> 01:32:02,904
- Yeah.
- Thanks, Dad.

1739
01:32:02,981 --> 01:32:04,918
- (stomach growls)
- (burps, grunts)

1740
01:32:04,986 --> 01:32:07,419
Not again.
Honey, where are the orange pills?

1741
01:32:07,488 --> 01:32:08,954
- Uh, kitchen.
- Sorry.

1742
01:32:09,988 --> 01:32:12,152
Fred:
Go sow your seed!

1743
01:32:12,227 --> 01:32:13,990
- Thanks, Dad.
- All right.

1744
01:32:14,062 --> 01:32:15,926
- Cookies.
- Oh.

1745
01:32:15,996 --> 01:32:18,986
Mom, just how I like 'em.

1746
01:32:19,064 --> 01:32:21,001
(all sigh)

1747
01:32:21,069 --> 01:32:23,002
All right.

1748
01:32:23,070 --> 01:32:24,969
Bye, Mom.

1749
01:32:25,038 --> 01:32:26,369
Bye.

1750
01:32:29,377 --> 01:32:31,072
(Karl hollers, indistinct)

1751
01:32:31,146 --> 01:32:32,669
Yeah!

1752
01:32:35,914 --> 01:32:38,442
Teddy:
She's ready to roll, boys.

1753
01:32:38,520 --> 01:32:40,147
- Mom: I love you boys!
- Later, Mom.

1754
01:32:40,220 --> 01:32:41,915
Bye!

1755
01:32:41,989 --> 01:32:43,012
Be careful!

1756
01:32:43,089 --> 01:32:45,117
# Liberate me #

1757
01:32:45,194 --> 01:32:47,923
- # Liberate me... #
- Mm-hmm!

1758
01:32:47,996 --> 01:32:53,129
# Liberate me, liberate me... #

1759
01:32:53,203 --> 01:32:54,760
Hogan:
Bye, Mom!

1760
01:32:54,837 --> 01:32:58,703
# Around the sun #

1761
01:32:58,772 --> 01:33:01,335
# On the run #

1762
01:33:01,411 --> 01:33:03,105
# Nothing can stop me... #

1763
01:33:03,179 --> 01:33:05,476
Gardener:
Adios, amigos!

1764
01:33:05,547 --> 01:33:06,672
# From having my fun #

1765
01:33:06,747 --> 01:33:09,378
# Liberate me #

1766
01:33:09,453 --> 01:33:14,946
# Liberate me, liberate me #

1767
01:33:15,023 --> 01:33:17,493
# Liberate me #

1768
01:33:18,528 --> 01:33:23,156
# Liberate me,
liberate me. #

1769
01:33:25,032 --> 01:33:28,027
Mom and Dad are home
and they're with Barry Stack.

1770
01:33:28,105 --> 01:33:29,128
- Fuck!
- Fuck!

1771
01:33:29,205 --> 01:33:30,831
Fuck!

1772
01:33:30,905 --> 01:33:32,872
(rock music playing)

1773
01:34:43,147 --> 01:34:45,080
Ah!

1774
01:34:46,653 --> 01:34:47,984
Ooh.

1775
01:34:52,290 --> 01:34:54,416
- Uh...
- Sorry!

1776
01:35:03,037 --> 01:35:06,232
# Around the sun #

1777
01:35:06,305 --> 01:35:08,772
# On the run #

1778
01:35:08,840 --> 01:35:11,812
# Nothing can stop me #

1779
01:35:11,879 --> 01:35:14,506
# From having my fun #

1780
01:35:14,581 --> 01:35:19,043
# Liberate me, liberate me #

1781
01:35:20,221 --> 01:35:24,656
# Liberate me,
liberate me #

1782
01:35:26,190 --> 01:35:30,595
# Liberate me, liberate me. #

1783
01:35:30,663 --> 01:35:33,222
(big band music playing)

1784
01:37:11,433 --> 01:37:13,461
Ah!

1785
01:37:13,538 --> 01:37:16,438
Mmm. Nuh-uh.

1786
01:37:16,506 --> 01:37:17,972
(laughs)

1787
01:37:18,040 --> 01:37:19,563
(sighs)

1788
01:37:19,641 --> 01:37:21,112
(glass shatters)
