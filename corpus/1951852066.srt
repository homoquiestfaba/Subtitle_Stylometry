00:00:04,887 --> 00:00:07,981
This is Senator John Kennedy...

2
00:00:08,023 --> 00:00:10,287
the Democratic nominee for
the office of the Presidency.

3
00:00:10,326 --> 00:00:12,760
The 1960's presents our country...

4
00:00:12,795 --> 00:00:15,593
with great opportunities
and great challenges.

5
00:00:19,134 --> 00:00:22,035
...Just what makes
that little ol' ant...

6
00:00:22,071 --> 00:00:25,666
...Think he'll move
that rubbertree plant?

7
00:00:25,708 --> 00:00:31,544
...Anyone knows an ant can't
move a rubbertree plant...

8
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:35,346
...But he's got high hopes...

9
00:00:35,384 --> 00:00:38,751
...He's got heigh hopes...

10
00:00:38,787 --> 00:00:45,454
...He's got high apple
pie in the sky hopes...

11
00:00:45,494 --> 00:00:48,429
...So any time you're gettin' low...

12
00:00:48,464 --> 00:00:50,193
...lnstead of lettin' go...

13
00:00:50,232 --> 00:00:53,599
...Just remember that ant...

14
00:00:53,636 --> 00:00:57,003
...Oops, there goes
another rubbertree plant...

15
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:00,406
...Oops, there goes
another rubbertree plant...

16
00:01:00,442 --> 00:01:04,970
...Oops, there goes
another problem, kerplop...

17
00:01:05,014 --> 00:01:06,140
...Kerplop.

18
00:01:07,516 --> 00:01:09,848
...He went away,
and you hung around...

19
00:01:09,885 --> 00:01:13,412
...And bothered me every night...

20
00:01:13,455 --> 00:01:14,854
...I wouldn't go out with you...

21
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:18,553
...You said things
that weren't very nice...

22
00:01:18,594 --> 00:01:22,052
...My boyfriend's back
and you're gonna be in trouble...

23
00:01:22,097 --> 00:01:25,464
...Hey-La Hey-La
My boyfriend's back...

24
00:01:25,501 --> 00:01:29,062
...When you see him comin'
you better cut out on the double...

25
00:01:29,104 --> 00:01:32,631
...Hey-La Hey-La
My boyfriend's back...

26
00:01:32,675 --> 00:01:36,304
...So look out now
'cause he's coming after you...

27
00:01:36,345 --> 00:01:39,542
...Hey-La Hey-La
My boyfriend's back...

28
00:01:39,581 --> 00:01:43,642
...Hey, he knows
what you've been trying...

29
00:01:43,686 --> 00:01:46,553
...And he knows
that you've been lying...

30
00:01:46,588 --> 00:01:50,217
...He's been gone
for such a long time...

31
00:01:50,259 --> 00:01:53,660
...Hey-La Hey-La
My boyfriend's back...

32
00:01:53,696 --> 00:01:57,257
...Now he's back
and things will be fine...

33
00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:00,666
...Hey-La Hey-La
My boyfriend's back...

34
00:02:00,703 --> 00:02:04,537
...'Cause he's kind of big
and he's awful strong...

35
00:02:04,573 --> 00:02:08,065
...Hey-La Hey-La
My boyfriend's back.

36
00:02:09,378 --> 00:02:11,812
Kit-Kat, come on!
I need to get in there!

37
00:02:11,847 --> 00:02:13,781
Do you mind?

38
00:02:13,816 --> 00:02:16,876
Not if I get to use
the john sometime this year!

39
00:02:20,422 --> 00:02:23,414
Michael, I can't believe
you left your report card

40
00:02:23,459 --> 00:02:26,394
lying on the counter!
I'm so proud of you!

41
00:02:26,428 --> 00:02:27,292
She's still in there.

42
00:02:29,398 --> 00:02:31,958
Did you see this?

43
00:02:32,001 --> 00:02:34,367
Oh, all A's.

44
00:02:34,403 --> 00:02:37,930
Me, I prefer a variety of letters.

45
00:02:37,973 --> 00:02:40,032
Your father is going
to be so pleased.

46
00:02:40,442 --> 00:02:42,069
I think you ought
to see this.

47
00:02:42,111 --> 00:02:44,409
Don't tell me. Let me guess...

48
00:02:44,446 --> 00:02:46,710
A, A, A, A... and A.

49
00:02:46,749 --> 00:02:47,408
Way to go.

50
00:02:48,484 --> 00:02:51,920
Did you read this?
Olzcievski transferred to Penn State.

51
00:02:51,954 --> 00:02:55,151
Looks like the Fighting Irish
need a quarterback.

52
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:56,714
Dad, let me just
enjoy the dance tonight...

53
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:59,387
I'll worry about
Notre Dame tomorrow.

54
00:02:59,428 --> 00:03:01,692
You don't have a thing
to worry about.

55
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:04,062
Kit-Kat: Hey, you guys...

56
00:03:04,099 --> 00:03:06,863
Well? How do I look?

57
00:03:19,615 --> 00:03:21,583
Long live the King!

58
00:03:25,888 --> 00:03:27,856
Thank you.

59
00:03:35,397 --> 00:03:38,127

60
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:15,028
("The Twist" plays)

61
00:04:36,758 --> 00:04:38,749
Dance with me!

62
00:05:26,341 --> 00:05:29,003
(music stops abruptly)

63
00:05:36,251 --> 00:05:38,879
You are grounded, young lady.
Until further notice.

64
00:05:38,921 --> 00:05:40,286
Why?
I didn't do anything.

65
00:05:40,322 --> 00:05:41,755
That's not what
Sister Elizabeth said.

66
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:43,223
What did Sister Busybody say?

67
00:05:43,258 --> 00:05:45,055
You stay out of this, mister.

68
00:05:45,093 --> 00:05:47,084
She said
you behaved disgracefully.

69
00:05:47,129 --> 00:05:48,153
I was dancing.

70
00:05:48,197 --> 00:05:52,065
In a lewd
and inappropriate manner.

71
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:54,432
My gosh, Katie
you're fifteen years old...

72
00:05:54,469 --> 00:05:57,734
- Sixteen!
- You can't behave this way!

73
00:05:57,773 --> 00:05:59,968
Katie, if you don't
respect yourself,

74
00:06:00,008 --> 00:06:01,805
how to you expect anybody else to?

75
00:06:01,843 --> 00:06:04,937
This is crazy. I was dancing, too.
Everybody was.

76
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:06,811
That's what Sister Elizabeth said.

77
00:06:06,848 --> 00:06:09,715
Then the whole thing descended
into chaos after Katie started it.

78
00:06:09,751 --> 00:06:13,312
That is so wrong. Everybody did it.
Why is she grounded?

79
00:06:13,355 --> 00:06:14,720
It's not fair!

80
00:06:14,756 --> 00:06:16,553
Fair? You want fair?

81
00:06:16,592 --> 00:06:18,924
Okay, you're grounded, too.

82
00:06:21,029 --> 00:06:23,259
("Stand By Me" plays)

83
00:06:35,177 --> 00:06:37,543
...Reverend Taylor,
it's all set...

84
00:06:37,579 --> 00:06:41,572
It'll be the four of us.
Next Tuesday.

85
00:07:32,801 --> 00:07:35,634
They just keep
beatin' on you, Daddy.

86
00:07:35,671 --> 00:07:37,639
That's what they do, Emmet.

87
00:07:37,673 --> 00:07:39,106
How come nobody'll stop 'em?

88
00:07:39,141 --> 00:07:41,268
King tried
to get the National Guard...

89
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:45,542
Kennedy's too busy
worrying about the Russians.

90
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:48,071
What're y'all gonna do?

91
00:07:48,116 --> 00:07:51,449
We keep sittin',
We keep marchin'.

92
00:07:51,486 --> 00:07:54,011
We go on to Birmingham.

93
00:07:55,424 --> 00:07:57,483
I lived in Alabama.

94
00:07:57,526 --> 00:08:00,256
I'm ready to do whatever we have to...

95
00:08:00,295 --> 00:08:02,820
but that Sheriff Bull Connor,

96
00:08:02,864 --> 00:08:04,422
that son-of-a-bitch is crazy.

97
00:08:04,466 --> 00:08:07,435
His idea of law
is twelve-gauge and double-barrel.

98
00:08:07,469 --> 00:08:10,302
You march in his town,
he'll call out the dogs

99
00:08:10,339 --> 00:08:11,636
and the fire hoses.

100
00:08:11,673 --> 00:08:15,404
That's why Martin
picked Birmingham...

101
00:08:15,444 --> 00:08:19,574
You want attention...
You got to put on a show.

102

(cheering)

103
00:08:29,758 --> 00:08:31,123
Okay, Brian.

104
00:08:34,262 --> 00:08:35,786
Brian...
I'll be open.

00:09:40,529 --> 00:09:42,156
Hey, Brian!

107
00:09:48,403 --> 00:09:51,668
You did it!
I'm so proud of ya!

108
00:09:51,706 --> 00:09:54,106
You're gonna look so good
in blue and gold!

109
00:09:54,142 --> 00:09:55,939
What a great pass!

110
00:10:00,682 --> 00:10:03,116
Hey, good game, Steve!
I still can't believe it!

111
00:10:03,151 --> 00:10:04,846
Believe it!
We did it!

112
00:10:05,253 --> 00:10:07,881
Wells, lucky catch!

113
00:10:07,923 --> 00:10:09,891
A couple of scouts
from Notre Dame thought so...

114
00:10:09,925 --> 00:10:12,485
I guess they figure
if God's lookin' out for you,

115
00:10:12,527 --> 00:10:14,154
you're their kinda guy.

116
00:10:14,196 --> 00:10:16,255
They're in the tunnel.
Don't keep 'em waiting.

117
00:10:16,298 --> 00:10:19,927
Brian, great season, kid.

118
00:10:19,968 --> 00:10:22,402
It's been a pleasure
to be your coach...

119
00:10:26,708 --> 00:10:31,839
They didn't get your name.
Your jersey was pretty dirty.

120
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,006
Yeah.

121
00:10:34,683 --> 00:10:38,016
You made the play,
same as you made all year.

122
00:10:38,053 --> 00:10:39,452
They got the right guy.

123
00:10:39,488 --> 00:10:43,982
I never expected that scholarship,
that was Dad.

124
00:10:44,025 --> 00:10:46,823
The important thing is,
you talk to those scouts

125
00:10:46,862 --> 00:10:49,296
and I get a couple of
six-packs to celebrate.

126
00:10:52,601 --> 00:10:54,432
Thanks, pal.

127
00:11:01,843 --> 00:11:07,372
There he is!
Great game, Champ!

128
00:11:07,415 --> 00:11:10,407
What did the scouts say?
Did they come down?

129
00:11:10,452 --> 00:11:11,885
Yeah, they came down...

130
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:16,050
I knew it!
Let's go out and celebrate...

131
00:11:16,091 --> 00:11:20,494
- I got plans.
- We'll celebrate as a family...

132
00:11:21,162 --> 00:11:25,531
Dad!
I'm goin' with my friends.

133
00:11:32,541 --> 00:11:34,702
There it is, ladies.
Sooner or later,

134
00:11:34,743 --> 00:11:37,769
the bottle comes up empty.

135
00:11:37,812 --> 00:11:39,712
They didn't tell
you that, did they?

136
00:11:39,748 --> 00:11:41,340
And you know what
you gotta do?

137
00:11:41,383 --> 00:11:44,978
I will tell you,
as soon as I figure it out.

138
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:46,419
Ain't that right, Bud?

139
00:11:46,454 --> 00:11:48,752
That's right, Bri.
You're the best, man.

140
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:49,984
Don't you forget it.

141
00:11:52,561 --> 00:11:56,725
Now, you are
just the man I'm lookin' for!

142
00:11:56,765 --> 00:11:58,164
Can I help you?

143
00:11:58,199 --> 00:12:00,030
You already are!
You're defending freedom...

144
00:12:00,068 --> 00:12:03,128
We need more men like you!
And do you know why?

145
00:12:05,407 --> 00:12:08,274
'Cause you can buy beer,
and we can't.

Thank you! Good man!
Good man!

150
00:12:24,826 --> 00:12:28,284
Damn, that uniform looked good!
Did you see that?

151
00:12:40,809 --> 00:12:42,140
Hey, mom,
hey, dad...

152
00:12:42,177 --> 00:12:43,872
What time is it?

153
00:12:43,912 --> 00:12:45,675
It's... late.

154
00:12:47,182 --> 00:12:49,275
You look like you were
having a good time.

155
00:12:49,317 --> 00:12:51,751
Yeah, a little celebration.

156
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:58,850
I... I got some good news.

157
00:12:58,893 --> 00:13:01,327
Notre Dame?

158
00:13:03,798 --> 00:13:05,231
Marine Corps.

159
00:13:07,402 --> 00:13:09,199
What?

160
00:13:09,237 --> 00:13:11,933
I enlisted.
I'm a Marine, just like you.

161
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:16,800
You did what?

162
00:13:16,845 --> 00:13:19,905
I joined up.
I thought you'd be proud.

163
00:13:19,948 --> 00:13:21,779
- What about school?
- What about...

164
00:13:21,816 --> 00:13:23,283
Notre Dame?

165
00:13:26,454 --> 00:13:30,083
See, that's the problem,
it's called the real world,

166
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:33,720
which is where I live...
and down here,

167
00:13:33,762 --> 00:13:38,790
I don't go to Notre Dame
'cause I ain't got the grades...

168
00:13:38,833 --> 00:13:40,630
that's Mikey department.

169
00:13:40,669 --> 00:13:46,608
And except in your mind,
I ain't got the moves, either.

170
00:13:46,641 --> 00:13:49,610
Brian... Honey, what happened?

171
00:13:49,644 --> 00:13:52,670
Nothing happened, Ma.
I'm just not good enough.

172
00:13:54,683 --> 00:13:59,416
And I'm not even sorry,
'cause it wasn't my fault.

173
00:13:59,454 --> 00:14:02,821
I did the best I could,
that's what's important, right?

174
00:14:09,864 --> 00:14:12,697
I think I could be
a really good Marine.

175
00:14:12,734 --> 00:14:16,397
I really thought
that would make you proud of me.

176
00:14:17,405 --> 00:14:21,205
Sweetheart...
Of course I'm proud of you.

177
00:14:26,881 --> 00:14:29,349
Dad?

178
00:14:39,661 --> 00:14:43,392
I've never been prouder
of anyone in my life.

179
00:15:05,186 --> 00:15:10,146
- Is that all you're taking?
- I don't need much.

180
00:15:10,191 --> 00:15:15,060
I guess they give you
everything you need.

181
00:15:15,096 --> 00:15:18,361
Not everything...
Come here.

182
00:15:23,772 --> 00:15:26,104
I'm gonna miss you,
Kit-Kat.

183
00:15:29,344 --> 00:15:31,005
Take care of her.

184
00:15:34,983 --> 00:15:37,816
- Dad, it's okay...
- C'mon, take it!

185
00:15:53,568 --> 00:15:56,969
It's okay, Mom
We're not even at war with anybody.

186
00:15:57,005 --> 00:16:00,133
I'm gonna miss you...

187
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:04,610
All right, guys.
I'll write.

188
00:16:33,641 --> 00:16:36,974
And toss the gauntlet
before the feet of tyranny,

189
00:16:37,011 --> 00:16:41,311
And I say, segregation now,
segregation tomorrow,

190
00:16:41,349 --> 00:16:43,647
and segregation forever.

("Baby, What You Want
Me To Do" plays)

192
00:17:20,021 --> 00:17:21,818
But you saw those pictures on TV...

193
00:17:21,856 --> 00:17:23,881
That's what Father Monahan
was talking about.

194
00:17:23,925 --> 00:17:25,688
I don't know, Michael.

195
00:17:25,727 --> 00:17:28,127
It's a chance to learn
about the real world.

196
00:17:28,162 --> 00:17:29,993
- Bill?
- Why can't I go?

197
00:17:30,031 --> 00:17:31,259
What do you think?

198
00:17:31,299 --> 00:17:35,292
It's a long way, we don't know
what's gonna happen in Mississippi.

199
00:17:35,336 --> 00:17:37,804
Father Monahan did say that he
wouldn't let him out of his sight.

200
00:17:37,839 --> 00:17:41,741
Do you think he'd say it was okay
if it wasn't safe as church?

201
00:17:41,776 --> 00:17:43,334
Isn't this what
President Kennedy said...

202
00:17:43,378 --> 00:17:47,337
"Ask not what
your country can do for you"?

203
00:17:47,382 --> 00:17:49,407
I think the Kennedys
would let their kids go.

204
00:17:52,854 --> 00:17:54,913
Kennedy's kids, eh?

206
00:18:11,606 --> 00:18:13,801
We're this
army of freedom fighters,

207
00:18:13,841 --> 00:18:17,675
sweeping away a tired,
bigoted oligarchy.

208
00:18:18,613 --> 00:18:22,674
- Are you a student?
- A freedom fighter.

209
00:18:23,651 --> 00:18:28,384
Listen, everybody.
We're going to do a job.

210
00:18:28,423 --> 00:18:32,382
To register Negroes to vote.

211
00:18:32,427 --> 00:18:36,989
We may not be that welcome
down in Greenwood.

213
00:19:06,361 --> 00:19:09,762
Reverend Taylor: Nice to meet you.
Thank you for coming.

214
00:19:09,797 --> 00:19:11,788
How are you doing?

215
00:19:15,103 --> 00:19:18,300
Welcome to Greenwood.

216
00:19:18,339 --> 00:19:20,569
I'm Reverend Taylor,
this is my son, Emmet.

217
00:19:20,608 --> 00:19:22,075
Hello.

218
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:24,476
How're you doing, Father?
Thank you for coming.

219
00:19:24,512 --> 00:19:26,343
Willie Taylor,
thanks for comin' down.

220
00:19:40,094 --> 00:19:42,654
- Hi.
- Hi.

221
00:19:42,697 --> 00:19:44,221
Are you in charge
of the music?

222
00:19:44,265 --> 00:19:47,598
No. My daddy put this on.

223
00:19:47,635 --> 00:19:49,466
Seems like a cool guy.

224
00:19:54,475 --> 00:19:56,966
Have you marched before?

225
00:19:57,011 --> 00:19:59,571
He wouldn't let me before,
but since you're goin'-

226
00:20:04,485 --> 00:20:07,215
What else you got there?

227
00:20:07,255 --> 00:20:10,713
- Jackie Wilson?
- No.

228
00:20:10,758 --> 00:20:12,589
Sam Cooke?

229
00:20:14,595 --> 00:20:16,324
James Brown.

230
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:22,600

Turn the music up!

234
00:23:23,684 --> 00:23:26,152
You puttin' shame
on that flag, boy.

235
00:23:26,187 --> 00:23:28,155
Give it to me.

236
00:23:30,358 --> 00:23:32,792
Y'all hear me, boy?
Give it to me!

237
00:23:32,893 --> 00:23:36,795
You damn Communist niggers,
get yourself on home, now!

238
00:23:36,831 --> 00:23:40,232
We are home, Mr. Manders.

239
00:23:42,737 --> 00:23:45,035
Y'all are obstructin'
the business of the county,

240
00:23:45,072 --> 00:23:46,699
and I'm askin' y'all to move on.

241

This is a constitutional assembly,
it's protected by law!

242
00:24:00,621 --> 00:24:04,455
This is a peaceful assembly.

243
00:24:10,364 --> 00:24:14,425
Y'all are under arrest!
Everybody inside. Move.

244

we are not afraid...

245
00:24:34,989 --> 00:24:44,921
...We are not afraid today...

...Deep in my heart...
I do believe...

I've known you man and boy
for 20 years, Willie...

248
00:24:51,672 --> 00:24:54,800
I ain't never known you
to act a fool before.

249

you gonna be in serious trouble.

they ain't gonna be here every day.

No, they won't, Sheriff...

254
00:25:12,393 --> 00:25:15,191
but we will...

255
00:25:15,229 --> 00:25:21,395
until every person that wants to vote
in this town is registered.

256

I do believe...

...We shall overcome...

259
00:26:18,025 --> 00:26:19,617

let freedom ring!

...lf America is to be
a great nation...

268
00:27:27,595 --> 00:27:31,497
This must become true.
So let freedom ring!

of New Hampshire,

270

...from every hill and
molehill in Mississippi...

271

they comfort me...

Thou preparest a table before me
in the presence of mine enemies.

00:37:16,683 --> 00:37:19,982
You can vote,
be whatever you want.

350
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:24,548
But you have to take advantage
of these opportunities now!

351
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:29,590
They were paid for in blood.

352
00:37:31,998 --> 00:37:33,556
You done?

353
00:37:35,102 --> 00:37:37,332
Go do your homework.

354
00:37:45,445 --> 00:37:47,743
It can't be that expensive.

355
00:37:47,781 --> 00:37:49,214
You're not paying for it.

356
00:37:49,249 --> 00:37:51,240
- If you wanna live in a dorm...
- I don't.

357
00:37:51,284 --> 00:37:55,721
Or an apartment, it's simple,
get a job.

358
00:37:55,755 --> 00:37:59,452
I can't,
I have classes at 11, 2:30 and 4.

359
00:37:59,493 --> 00:38:02,155
Not to mention
the 7:30 Civics class...

360
00:38:02,195 --> 00:38:03,992
plus homework!

361
00:38:04,030 --> 00:38:06,999
I know, the world's smallest violin
playing "Hearts and Flowers."

362
00:38:07,033 --> 00:38:08,660
Get some new material.

363
00:38:08,702 --> 00:38:11,728
I'm giving you an opportunity
I never had...

364
00:38:11,771 --> 00:38:15,502
To go to school,
earn a decent living...

365
00:38:15,542 --> 00:38:18,739
It isn't a trade school!
It's about the world.

366
00:38:18,778 --> 00:38:24,307
Wanna learn about the world?
Don't work, you don't eat.

367
00:38:24,351 --> 00:38:25,682
That's the world.

368
00:38:25,719 --> 00:38:29,348
This a private war,
or can any old soldier join?

369
00:38:29,389 --> 00:38:31,880
Got off earlier than I thought.

370
00:38:32,826 --> 00:38:34,657
Hey, Brian!

371
00:38:34,694 --> 00:38:36,958
Kit-Kat, I missed you, too.

372
00:38:36,997 --> 00:38:40,455
Sergeant, already!
Born leader, huh?

373
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:42,263
Take after the old man.

374
00:38:43,136 --> 00:38:46,037
- I'm so happy you're home!
- It's not gonna for be long.

375
00:38:46,072 --> 00:38:48,632
It's okay,
I've got some good news.

376
00:38:48,675 --> 00:38:50,802
I'm going to Vietnam.

377
00:38:52,546 --> 00:38:55,379
That's good!

378
00:39:03,323 --> 00:39:06,053
We'll stay for as long
as it takes...

379
00:39:06,092 --> 00:39:09,027
we shall provide whatever
help is required...

380
00:39:09,062 --> 00:39:12,225
...to win the battle against
the Communists insurgents.

381
00:39:17,437 --> 00:39:20,031
("The Times They Are
A Changin"' plays)

382
00:39:43,129 --> 00:39:44,790
Good morning.

383
00:39:44,831 --> 00:39:46,765
On behalf of Loyola University,

384
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,893
let me welcome you to
the Dawn Soul Patrol!

385
00:39:48,935 --> 00:39:51,301
The Civics course designed
for those students

386
00:39:51,338 --> 00:39:53,363
without friends in high places.

387
00:39:53,406 --> 00:39:55,033
Please call me Father Dan

388
00:39:55,075 --> 00:39:59,171
as we mutually court
eternal damnation this semester.

389
00:39:59,212 --> 00:40:00,941
For those of you
who associate this collar

390
00:40:00,981 --> 00:40:04,041
with the status quo,
please be advised...

391
00:40:04,084 --> 00:40:07,383
I want us out
of our undeclared war in Vietnam.

392
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:09,411
I founded the
Catholic Peace Fellowship,

393
00:40:09,456 --> 00:40:11,890
I registered
voters in Mississippi...

394
00:40:11,925 --> 00:40:15,986
I'm a pacifist
and I believe in social protest.

395
00:40:16,029 --> 00:40:20,295
I'd like nothing more than to
turn you on to the possibility...

396
00:40:20,333 --> 00:40:22,665
that you can make a difference.

397
00:40:23,436 --> 00:40:25,336
Everyone in favor?

398
00:40:29,075 --> 00:40:30,702
Let's change the world.

399
00:40:48,295 --> 00:40:50,126
Father Dan? Michael Herlihy.

400
00:40:53,166 --> 00:40:57,830
You mentioned
an undeclared war in Vietnam?

401
00:40:57,871 --> 00:40:59,031
What was that about?

402
00:41:01,574 --> 00:41:05,476
Our country is involved
in a civil war in Southeast Asia

403
00:41:05,512 --> 00:41:08,504
in order to pursue the Cold War
against Communism.

404
00:41:08,548 --> 00:41:11,676
Most Americans like you
haven't been told about it.

405
00:41:13,253 --> 00:41:14,151
If you want to find out more,

406
00:41:14,187 --> 00:41:16,553
you ought to go to
the teach-in in New York.

407
00:41:16,589 --> 00:41:19,217
I don't know...
My brother's over there.

408
00:41:19,259 --> 00:41:21,056
Then you have to go.

409
00:41:21,094 --> 00:41:24,621
You owe it to yourself to find
out as much as you possibly can.

410
00:41:24,664 --> 00:41:29,158
It's the first nationwide
student anti-war meeting.

411
00:41:29,202 --> 00:41:31,466
Got plenty of room
if you need a ride.

412
00:41:44,617 --> 00:41:47,552
Three Communist PT boats
attacked an American destroyer

413
00:41:47,587 --> 00:41:49,748
off the coast
of Vietnam yesterday...

414
00:41:49,789 --> 00:41:53,350
Today, President Johnson's
response was hard and tough.

415
00:41:53,393 --> 00:41:56,453
To any armed attack
upon our forces...

416
00:41:57,530 --> 00:41:59,794
we shall reply.

417
00:41:59,833 --> 00:42:02,199
To any in Southeast Asia
who ask our help

418
00:42:02,235 --> 00:42:04,135
in defending their freedom...

419
00:42:04,170 --> 00:42:05,364
We shall give it.

420
00:42:06,673 --> 00:42:10,609
...When the operation
of the machine becomes so odious,

421
00:42:10,643 --> 00:42:14,170
makes you so sick at heart
that you can't take part...

422
00:42:18,017 --> 00:42:21,475
...put your bodies
upon the gears, upon the wheels,

423
00:42:21,521 --> 00:42:24,217
upon all the apparatus,
you've got to make it stop!

424
00:42:48,314 --> 00:42:53,115
All right,
let's settle in, now!

425
00:42:58,091 --> 00:42:59,683
Please, sit down - sit down!

426
00:43:01,261 --> 00:43:03,456
Thank you.

427
00:43:03,496 --> 00:43:05,191
My name is Kenny Klein,

428
00:43:05,231 --> 00:43:07,756
president of the
Columbia chapter of SDS.

429
00:43:10,336 --> 00:43:13,271
If you're from out of town,
thank you for coming to New York.

430
00:43:13,306 --> 00:43:15,399
If you're here for the
Young Republicans convention,

431
00:43:15,442 --> 00:43:17,637
boy, are you ever
in the wrong place!

432
00:43:18,378 --> 00:43:20,403
This is a teach-in
against the war.

433
00:43:20,447 --> 00:43:22,540
We are here to do two things...

434
00:43:22,582 --> 00:43:25,642
first, to let you know what is
really going on in Vietnam.

435
00:43:25,685 --> 00:43:28,119
And the second and most important...

436
00:43:28,154 --> 00:43:30,486
...to bring the machinery
of this war

437
00:43:30,523 --> 00:43:32,684
to a grinding halt.

438
00:43:39,299 --> 00:43:40,459
The floor's open...

439
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:42,730
George Lindelof, SNCC.

440
00:43:42,769 --> 00:43:44,634
Organize more
teach-ins like this one.

441
00:43:44,671 --> 00:43:46,036
I think it's great!

442
00:43:46,940 --> 00:43:49,841
Thomas Hayes,
Ann Arbor Students Against The War.

443
00:43:49,876 --> 00:43:52,640
I worked on the first teach-in,
and we learned

444
00:43:52,679 --> 00:43:55,079
that you have to focus
the media and the public

445
00:43:55,114 --> 00:43:58,049
attention to the problem.
Not just marching...

446
00:44:00,019 --> 00:44:02,249
Petitions! Petitions!
Letter-writing campaigns...

447
00:44:04,858 --> 00:44:08,794
The United States government
is killing human beings in Vietnam.

448
00:44:08,828 --> 00:44:10,659
Right now.
We have to stop them.

449
00:44:10,697 --> 00:44:13,791
Send them 10,000 letters
with American names on them.

450
00:44:13,833 --> 00:44:15,266
They'll stop!

451
00:44:17,904 --> 00:44:20,395
What're we gonna do?
Blow up the troop trains?

452
00:44:23,009 --> 00:44:27,275
Quiet.
What did you just say?

453
00:44:28,581 --> 00:44:31,482
Blow up the troop trains.
I'm kidding.

454
00:44:31,518 --> 00:44:33,611
Now, that's an idea!

455
00:44:36,556 --> 00:44:38,717
We don't have to
blow up a train,

456
00:44:38,758 --> 00:44:42,023
all we have to do
is lie down in front of it.

457
00:44:43,396 --> 00:44:44,886
What if they run over us?

458
00:44:44,931 --> 00:44:48,264
That's the whole point, obviously
they're not gonna run over us.

459
00:44:52,672 --> 00:44:54,367
Excuse me...

460
00:44:56,743 --> 00:44:59,439
It's a great idea,
but it's way too dangerous.

461
00:44:59,479 --> 00:45:02,846
Unless the people are experienced
in passive resistance...

462
00:45:02,882 --> 00:45:05,442
- What's your name?
- Sarah Weinstock.

463
00:45:05,485 --> 00:45:07,885
Actions like that
require more responsibility.

464
00:45:07,921 --> 00:45:11,379
- What delegation?
- I'm not with a delegation.

465
00:45:11,424 --> 00:45:14,325
You're speaking
on behalf of...?

466
00:45:16,429 --> 00:45:18,056
Herself.

467
00:45:20,266 --> 00:45:23,758
Michael Herlihy, Chicago.
Progressive Catholics.

468
00:45:23,803 --> 00:45:27,500
When we act like the enemy,
we become them.

469
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:29,838
If you're going to ask people
to lie down in front of trains,

470
00:45:29,876 --> 00:45:32,572
the least you can do is listen
when they have something to say.

471
00:45:35,882 --> 00:45:40,842
That was beautiful.
I'd like to get to business...

472
00:45:40,887 --> 00:45:45,017
- Some suggestions?
- March on the Pentagon...

473
00:46:11,517 --> 00:46:14,111
You wanna
get some coffee?

474
00:46:14,153 --> 00:46:15,620
Yeah.

475
00:46:19,993 --> 00:46:21,722
I can't believe
your parents let you go

476
00:46:21,761 --> 00:46:23,888
to Mississippi.
That's amazing.

477
00:46:26,532 --> 00:46:28,762
If you met them,
you really wouldn't believe it.

478
00:46:28,801 --> 00:46:32,328
I don't think
we realized what we were doing.

479
00:46:32,372 --> 00:46:37,571
My parents,
Upper East Side liberals.

480
00:46:37,610 --> 00:46:42,274
We discuss politics,
from McCarthyism

481
00:46:42,315 --> 00:46:43,839
to Civil Rights, but that's it!

482
00:46:43,883 --> 00:46:46,351
That's all we do, we talk.

483
00:46:46,386 --> 00:46:49,355
Heaven forbid, I should actually
ever do something.

484
00:46:49,389 --> 00:46:51,220
Well, you're here.

485
00:46:52,659 --> 00:46:54,388
What's your major?

486
00:46:54,427 --> 00:46:58,761
My major's a major joke.
I don't even know.

487
00:46:58,798 --> 00:47:00,857
It's supposed to be Art History,

488
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:03,869
but I'm thinking about
Political Science.

489
00:47:03,903 --> 00:47:05,598
How about you?

490
00:47:05,638 --> 00:47:07,128
History, but I keep thinking

491
00:47:07,173 --> 00:47:10,336
if I'm studying it,
I'm not making it.

492
00:47:10,376 --> 00:47:13,402
"He who's not busy being born,
is busy dying."

493
00:47:13,446 --> 00:47:15,676
- That's Dylan?
- Yeah.

494
00:47:15,715 --> 00:47:18,115
- Where'd you get turned on to him?
- In Mississippi.

495
00:47:18,151 --> 00:47:20,449
Some guy shows up in
the field and starts singing.

496
00:47:20,486 --> 00:47:23,387
- It was Dylan.
- Are you serious?

497
00:47:23,423 --> 00:47:25,687
Amazing.

498
00:47:25,725 --> 00:47:28,956
I haven't done anything.

499
00:47:28,995 --> 00:47:31,759
- Look...
- What?

500
00:47:31,798 --> 00:47:33,732
No lines.
Not one.

501
00:47:38,004 --> 00:47:39,699
You wanna try
and find him?

502
00:47:39,739 --> 00:47:40,797
- Who?
- Dylan.

503
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:42,535
He plays
all over the Village.

504
00:47:42,575 --> 00:47:45,135
I don't know where,
but do you wanna look?

505
00:47:47,447 --> 00:47:52,885
I'm ready to go anywhere.
"Ready for to fade..."

506
00:47:52,919 --> 00:47:55,046
"Into my own parade."

507
00:47:55,088 --> 00:48:00,185
Cast your dancin' spell my way,
I promise to go wanderin..."

508
00:48:00,727 --> 00:48:03,025
("Hey Mister Tambourine Man"
plays)

509
00:48:13,473 --> 00:48:16,601
I'd like to start with a real
protest song, called,

510
00:48:16,642 --> 00:48:17,973
"I Ain't Marchin' Anymore."

511
00:48:47,874 --> 00:48:49,967
The defendants Lenny Bruce
and Howard Solomon

512
00:48:50,009 --> 00:48:51,203
were tried on
two separate counts...

513
00:48:51,244 --> 00:48:54,008
giving an indecent performance,
in violation of Section 11-48

514
00:48:54,046 --> 00:48:56,014
of the penal law of New York.

515
00:48:56,048 --> 00:48:58,346
That's the Grand Jury.
That was the first bust.

516
00:49:54,607 --> 00:49:57,872
"The rooster crows
at the break of dawn."

517
00:49:57,910 --> 00:50:02,643
"Look out your window
and I'll be gone."

518
00:50:02,682 --> 00:50:04,946
"Don't think twice,
it's all right."

519
00:50:06,719 --> 00:50:09,279
The most amazing night...

520
00:50:12,058 --> 00:50:15,585
Are you going to Berkeley
to stop the troop trains?

521
00:50:15,628 --> 00:50:18,290
What do you think?

522
00:50:18,331 --> 00:50:21,528
I don't think
I can wait that long.

523
00:50:21,567 --> 00:50:25,264
I think you should
enroll at Columbia.

524
00:50:25,304 --> 00:50:29,001
Art history
or Political Science?

525
00:50:47,860 --> 00:50:48,849
Gotta go.

526
00:50:55,801 --> 00:50:57,530
Oh, damn!

527
00:50:57,570 --> 00:50:59,435
What?
What'd you forget?

528
00:50:59,939 --> 00:51:01,930
My heart...

529
00:51:19,191 --> 00:51:21,182
Good night, Bob...

530
00:51:25,731 --> 00:51:27,323
("She Belongs To Me" playing)

531
00:51:53,259 --> 00:51:55,921
Dearest Michael, your paper
on nonviolence

532
00:51:55,962 --> 00:51:58,829
and social change
was amazing.

533
00:51:58,864 --> 00:52:01,992
A strong argument
from what you saw in Greenwood.

534
00:52:02,034 --> 00:52:05,162
Michael:
Sarah, Angel of the Mysteries.

535
00:52:05,204 --> 00:52:10,232
Your poems are like a rainstorm
on my desert soul.

536
00:52:10,276 --> 00:52:12,676
Have you heard
the new Dylan album?

537
00:52:12,712 --> 00:52:15,340
I play "Love Minus Zero"
over and over,

538
00:52:15,381 --> 00:52:16,643
and think of you.

539
00:52:16,682 --> 00:52:19,742
Dear Michael,
I've given up poetry.

540
00:52:19,785 --> 00:52:21,548
It seems like a completely
bourgeois indulgence

541
00:52:21,587 --> 00:52:24,351
when there's so much
work to do.

542
00:52:24,390 --> 00:52:27,951
I can't wait for the troop train
sit-in at Berkeley on the 15th.

543
00:52:27,994 --> 00:52:29,154
Will you be there?

544
00:52:41,474 --> 00:52:45,240
...There she was,
just walkin' down the street...

545
00:52:58,090 --> 00:53:01,992
...She looked good,
she looked fine...

546
00:53:04,463 --> 00:53:07,864
...Before I knew it,
she was walkin' next to me...

547
00:53:15,775 --> 00:53:19,939
...I knew we was
falling in love...

548
00:53:27,353 --> 00:53:30,914
...Now, we're together,
nearly every single day...

549
00:53:42,468 --> 00:53:46,370
...l'm hers, she's mine...

550
00:53:46,405 --> 00:53:48,202
...l'm hers, she's mine...

551
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:50,208
...wedding bells
are gonna chime...

552
00:53:57,316 --> 00:53:59,113
...We're singin'...

553
00:54:01,287 --> 00:54:02,811
...Oh, yeah.

554
00:54:06,292 --> 00:54:07,919
(cheering)
Thank You!

555
00:54:11,497 --> 00:54:13,226
Keep drinking.
The drunker you get...

556
00:54:13,265 --> 00:54:14,527
the better we sound.

557
00:54:27,012 --> 00:54:29,606
Hey little girl
in the high school sweater...

558
00:54:29,648 --> 00:54:32,208
"Gee, I'd like
to know you better."

559
00:54:35,321 --> 00:54:37,812
Wow, you're so beautiful.

560
00:54:37,857 --> 00:54:39,825
Thank you.

561
00:54:41,460 --> 00:54:44,896
You wanna
go upstairs?

562
00:54:44,930 --> 00:54:47,956
What's upstairs?

563
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,491
Why don't you come and find out?

564
00:54:52,905 --> 00:54:55,169
Okay.

565
00:55:37,016 --> 00:55:40,349
Okay?

566
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:19,020
I gotta split, you know?
Time for my second set.

567
00:56:21,927 --> 00:56:23,895
Am I gonna see you?

568
00:56:23,929 --> 00:56:29,162
- I'll be right downstairs.
- No, I mean, really.

569
00:56:29,768 --> 00:56:33,602
Sure, absolutely.
I mean, if you want to.

570
00:56:33,973 --> 00:56:37,465
Soon as we get paid,
I'm going to San Francisco.

571
00:56:37,509 --> 00:56:39,136
That's where all
the action is.

572
00:56:41,814 --> 00:56:44,044
Well...

573
00:56:45,417 --> 00:56:47,351
Here's where we're staying.

574
00:56:51,924 --> 00:56:54,415
If you get out there,
gimme a call, okay?

575
00:57:09,308 --> 00:57:14,905
...Don't let the sun
catch you cryin'...

576
00:57:17,950 --> 00:57:24,287
...Tonight's the time
for all your tears...

577
00:57:25,958 --> 00:57:30,054
...Your heart may be
broken tonight...

578
00:57:30,796 --> 00:57:35,233
...but tomorrow
in the morning light...

579
00:57:35,267 --> 00:57:40,864
...Don't let the sun
catch you cryin'...

580
00:57:56,355 --> 00:57:59,051
Forget a day, take two...

581
00:57:59,091 --> 00:58:00,524
Never three.

582
00:58:00,559 --> 00:58:02,527
There are is
an instruction sheet,

583
00:58:02,561 --> 00:58:05,029
but that's really
all there is to it.

584
00:58:06,565 --> 00:58:09,830
You've just taken control of
your own body and your own life.

585
00:58:09,868 --> 00:58:12,428
Have you thought this through?

586
00:58:12,471 --> 00:58:14,530
I think so.

587
00:58:14,573 --> 00:58:16,837
Do you have any
concerns about the Pill?

588
00:58:16,875 --> 00:58:22,939
Yeah.
How to keep Mom from finding them.

589
00:58:36,095 --> 00:58:38,325
Will he marry you?

590
00:58:40,899 --> 00:58:42,560
Are you sure?

591
00:58:44,903 --> 00:58:46,803
He doesn't even
know my name, Mom.

592
00:58:56,415 --> 00:59:00,681
There are things we can do.
Nobody has to know...

593
00:59:00,719 --> 00:59:04,120
There are places you can
go to to have the baby...

594
00:59:04,156 --> 00:59:08,525
It's not like a dress you grow
out of and give away, my God!

595
00:59:11,163 --> 00:59:15,566
Then, we can raise
the baby right here.

596
00:59:16,935 --> 00:59:19,233
I'm home!

597
00:59:24,009 --> 00:59:25,840
Hey, how's my girls?

598
00:59:29,882 --> 00:59:31,577
What?

599
00:59:33,685 --> 00:59:35,414
Brian...?

600
00:59:35,454 --> 00:59:36,751
Brian's fine.

601
00:59:38,857 --> 00:59:40,017
Well, what, then?

602
00:59:42,761 --> 00:59:45,423
Now... don't say
anything foolish.

603
00:59:48,367 --> 00:59:50,597
She's pregnant.

604
00:59:54,706 --> 00:59:56,674
- Whose?
- Mine!

605
00:59:58,644 --> 01:00:01,545
Oh Lord!
Mary and Joseph!

606
01:00:01,580 --> 01:00:02,740
Bill...

607
01:00:02,781 --> 01:00:04,510
Who did this?
Who knocked you up?

608
01:00:04,550 --> 01:00:06,177
I want his name.
Now.

609
01:00:06,218 --> 01:00:08,345
Don't do this!

610
01:00:08,387 --> 01:00:09,376
Katie?

611
01:00:09,421 --> 01:00:11,981
I'm gonna ask one more time,
what's his name?

612
01:00:12,024 --> 01:00:14,219
I don't know!
There've been too many!

613
01:00:14,259 --> 01:00:15,385
Your little girl's a whore!

614
01:00:15,427 --> 01:00:16,951
- Katie, don't say that!
- You don't have to...

615
01:00:16,995 --> 01:00:19,395
- Michael!
- I wanna have the baby!

616
01:00:19,431 --> 01:00:21,991
I'm not going to let some
bastard into this house.

617
01:00:22,034 --> 01:00:24,298
- Who'd want to?
- Be quiet, all of you!

618
01:00:24,336 --> 01:00:25,860
A person can't even
hear herself think!

619
01:00:25,904 --> 01:00:27,565
One person
sure as hell didn't!

620
01:00:27,606 --> 01:00:29,130
- For God's sake, Dad...
- Shut up, Michael!

621
01:00:29,174 --> 01:00:31,165
Listen to me,
young lady...

622
01:00:31,210 --> 01:00:34,941
Young lady?
That's a laugh!

623
01:00:34,980 --> 01:00:36,140
I'm not going to
let this problem

624
01:00:36,181 --> 01:00:38,775
bring shame and ridicule
into this house!

625
01:00:38,817 --> 01:00:40,375
It's not a problem,
it's a baby!

626
01:00:40,419 --> 01:00:42,717
You're so smart!
You're so damn smart!

627
01:00:42,754 --> 01:00:45,416
You weren't so smart
when you let this happen!

628
01:00:45,457 --> 01:00:47,186
- Bill!
- Were you!

629
01:00:58,504 --> 01:01:00,472
("Don't Worry Baby" playing)

630
01:01:21,827 --> 01:01:24,796
Dear Michael,
thanks for the loan.

631
01:01:24,830 --> 01:01:27,025
I miss you already.

632
01:01:27,065 --> 01:01:29,226
I just couldn't face
Dad over the next six months,

633
01:01:29,268 --> 01:01:31,759
or Brian when he comes home.

634
01:01:31,803 --> 01:01:34,704
I'm sorry.
I know you understand.

635
01:01:34,740 --> 01:01:37,675
I'll write as soon
as things get settled.

636
01:01:37,709 --> 01:01:39,336
Ask Dad to forgive me.

637
01:01:39,378 --> 01:01:41,972
I know Mom's
already making novenas...

638
01:01:42,014 --> 01:01:46,246
All my love to you
and Mom... and Dad.

639
01:01:46,285 --> 01:01:47,445
Love, Kit-Kat.

640
01:02:40,706 --> 01:02:43,334
Thanks a lot.
Bye.

641
01:03:38,730 --> 01:03:41,631
Neal?

642
01:03:41,667 --> 01:03:43,430
Hi.

643
01:03:49,141 --> 01:03:53,601
Wow... Katie from Chicago, right?

644
01:03:57,049 --> 01:03:59,108
This is too cool.
Come on in.

645
01:03:59,151 --> 01:04:01,312
I can't believe
you found me.

646
01:04:01,353 --> 01:04:06,791
This is my old lady...
Melissa, Katie from Chicago.

647
01:04:06,825 --> 01:04:10,226
Hi, Katie from Chicago.

648
01:04:10,262 --> 01:04:11,854
Come on in...

649
01:04:16,268 --> 01:04:18,065
This is kind of hard...

650
01:04:20,906 --> 01:04:24,842
You're pregnant, right?

651
01:04:27,946 --> 01:04:30,608
That is way out, mama.

652
01:04:32,751 --> 01:04:34,981
I have ordered to Vietnam
the Air Mobile Division,

653
01:04:35,020 --> 01:04:39,457
and other forces,
which will raise our fighting strength

654
01:04:39,491 --> 01:04:43,894
from 75,000 to 125,000 men
almost immediately.

655
01:04:43,929 --> 01:04:46,363
Additional forces
will be needed later...

656
01:04:46,398 --> 01:04:49,299
and they will be
sent as requested.

657
01:05:23,802 --> 01:05:25,269
If you're going to march,
sign up.

658
01:05:25,303 --> 01:05:29,000
Take a petition and
sign up everybody else...

659
01:05:29,040 --> 01:05:31,099
and don't come back
until it's filled.

660
01:05:36,081 --> 01:05:37,742
Michael!

661
01:05:43,221 --> 01:05:44,552
Do you like tuna?

662
01:05:44,589 --> 01:05:47,558
It's my favorite flavor.

663
01:05:47,592 --> 01:05:49,890
I wanna talk,
but I got all this work.

664
01:05:49,928 --> 01:05:52,226
You don't think I came here
to see you, do ya?

665
01:05:52,264 --> 01:05:55,062
Oh. If you're gonna march,
sign up...

666
01:05:55,100 --> 01:05:55,429
If your gonna watch,

667
01:05:55,467 --> 01:05:57,526
take a petition
and sign up everybody else.

668
01:05:57,569 --> 01:06:00,561
- What're you gonna do?
- I'm marchin'.

669
01:06:08,413 --> 01:06:12,440
Stay on the tracks!
Stop this train!

670
01:06:14,986 --> 01:06:18,183
No more Americans
in Vietnam!

671
01:06:25,831 --> 01:06:28,823
They have no choice!
The train will stop!

672
01:06:33,638 --> 01:06:36,334
Don't get off the tracks,
the train will stop!

673
01:06:39,244 --> 01:06:41,041
Stop this train!

674
01:06:42,781 --> 01:06:46,273
Stop this train!
Stop the war!

675
01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:50,017
Get off!

676
01:06:50,055 --> 01:06:51,044
Stop the war!

677
01:06:51,089 --> 01:06:53,023
Move!

678
01:07:05,871 --> 01:07:08,635
It's not our war!
Stop the train!

679
01:07:12,677 --> 01:07:15,612
Stop the train!
It's not our war!

680
01:07:15,647 --> 01:07:19,413
("Do You Believe In Magic" plays)

681
01:07:19,451 --> 01:07:22,682
It was amazing!
It was like you de-materialized

682
01:07:22,721 --> 01:07:24,416
or did some
Buddhist transformation!

683
01:07:24,456 --> 01:07:26,390
Buddhist transformation, huh?

684
01:07:26,424 --> 01:07:29,655
Hey, you...
Pay.

685
01:07:29,694 --> 01:07:30,786
What?

686
01:07:33,465 --> 01:07:37,060
Hey, hey...
I got it.

687
01:07:39,938 --> 01:07:41,872
Thank you very much.

688
01:07:43,708 --> 01:07:45,938
Was it something I said?

689
01:07:45,977 --> 01:07:48,104
You should read Fanon's
"Wretched of the Earth".

690
01:07:48,146 --> 01:07:50,114
This guy, he's just
tryin' to make a buck...

691
01:07:50,148 --> 01:07:52,673
The faster you pay
the faster he makes deliveries.

692
01:07:54,119 --> 01:07:55,552
He comes from
a tribal culture,

693
01:07:55,587 --> 01:07:58,647
and capitalism doesn't
leave time for rituals...

694
01:07:58,690 --> 01:08:01,386
so he's had to trade
good manners for efficiency.

695
01:08:01,426 --> 01:08:03,656
It's like getting caught under
the wheels of the revolution.

696
01:08:04,562 --> 01:08:07,258
You're joking.

697
01:08:07,299 --> 01:08:10,359
Sometimes, you have to
crawl into the belly of the beast.

698
01:08:10,402 --> 01:08:12,996
The belly of the beast?
I think that's this carton...

699
01:08:15,140 --> 01:08:17,131
That's cute.
All I'm suggesting...

700
01:08:17,175 --> 01:08:19,871
is by not sharing
in the workers' struggle,

701
01:08:19,911 --> 01:08:22,243
by not understanding what the
demands of free-market imperialism

702
01:08:22,280 --> 01:08:24,009
have forced him to leave behind,

703
01:08:24,049 --> 01:08:26,210
I'm not surprised you don't
understand his bad temper.

704
01:08:26,251 --> 01:08:29,778
The tigers of wrath are wiser
than the horses of instruction.

705
01:08:29,821 --> 01:08:32,255
I'm not trying
to compete with you...

706
01:08:32,290 --> 01:08:34,952
"Beat, or cheat,
or mistreat you."

707
01:08:38,530 --> 01:08:40,589
You dig Dylan?

708
01:08:40,632 --> 01:08:43,499
Yeah.

709
01:08:43,535 --> 01:08:45,093
He's gonna be in Newport in July,

710
01:08:45,136 --> 01:08:46,933
I might be able to get us
a couple of backstage passes.

711
01:08:46,972 --> 01:08:50,373
- If you're interested.
- Are you serious?

712
01:08:50,408 --> 01:08:51,705
Yeah.

713
01:08:51,743 --> 01:08:53,677
That would be amazing!

714
01:08:53,712 --> 01:08:56,203
Yeah, it'd be fun...
It'd be nice.

715
01:09:00,051 --> 01:09:01,575
Can Michael come?

716
01:09:04,756 --> 01:09:07,384
I don't know.
I'm sure there are tickets left.

717
01:09:07,425 --> 01:09:09,416
Wouldn't that be great!

718
01:09:23,708 --> 01:09:24,504
Here.

719
01:09:24,542 --> 01:09:28,069
- I'm okay.
- You're okay?

720
01:09:28,113 --> 01:09:31,549
I don't think it works on me.

721
01:09:31,583 --> 01:09:34,780
This a 2,000 year old
Native American sacrament...

722
01:09:34,819 --> 01:09:36,719
It works on you.

723
01:09:36,755 --> 01:09:41,317
Don't abandon us, now.
Smoke with us.

724
01:09:57,175 --> 01:09:58,836
Nothing...

725
01:10:02,414 --> 01:10:04,279
I'm not sure what's
supposed to happen...

726
01:10:04,315 --> 01:10:08,513
I'm afraid it probably
doesn't affect me.

727
01:10:13,024 --> 01:10:16,221
Wanna know the secret
of the universe?

728
01:10:16,261 --> 01:10:18,252
Brownies.

729
01:10:18,296 --> 01:10:21,424
If you can resist these,
you're definitely not stoned, okay?

730
01:10:41,719 --> 01:10:44,119
Why doesn't somebody just
fly out there and bring her home?

731
01:10:44,155 --> 01:10:46,419
She didn't put on
a return address.

732
01:10:46,458 --> 01:10:47,925
We find guys in the jungle...

733
01:10:47,959 --> 01:10:50,325
We can't find
somebody in San Francisco?

734
01:10:50,361 --> 01:10:52,886
She hasn't given any indication
she wants us to find her.

735
01:10:52,931 --> 01:10:54,364
I can't imagine why.

736
01:10:54,399 --> 01:10:55,764
Don't talk to me
that way, young man.

737
01:10:55,800 --> 01:10:57,392
I didn't say anything about you.

738
01:10:57,435 --> 01:11:00,666
Stop it!
Both of you.

739
01:11:00,705 --> 01:11:05,699
She's gone.
I just pray she comes back safe,

740
01:11:05,743 --> 01:11:07,040
and with her baby.

741
01:11:15,720 --> 01:11:17,745
I re-upped to fight the Reds.

742
01:11:17,789 --> 01:11:20,815
You say "Reds" like there's
some monolithic Communist state...

743
01:11:20,859 --> 01:11:24,090
The truth is, the Russians and
Chinese can't stand each other.

744
01:11:24,129 --> 01:11:25,858
Besides, it's not about communism.

745
01:11:25,897 --> 01:11:27,922
We stuck our noses
into a damn civil war.

746
01:11:27,966 --> 01:11:29,160
I'm only here a few days,

747
01:11:29,200 --> 01:11:31,168
do we have to talk about
my day job the whole time?

748
01:11:31,202 --> 01:11:32,635
We just shouldn't be there, Bri.

749
01:11:34,172 --> 01:11:35,537
You read a lot more than I do,

750
01:11:35,573 --> 01:11:38,599
but don't you think the President
has bright boys working for him, too?

751
01:11:38,643 --> 01:11:42,374
Except they have to prove LBJ can
shoot farther than Barry Goldwater.

752
01:11:42,413 --> 01:11:44,506
Even if they destroy Vietnam
to prove it.

753
01:11:45,483 --> 01:11:47,348
You talk this way
to Mom and Dad?

754
01:11:47,385 --> 01:11:49,148
Yeah, I do.

755
01:11:49,187 --> 01:11:51,178
You think they need to hear
your crap while I'm over there?

756
01:11:51,222 --> 01:11:53,281
It's the truth.
And I'm worried about you...

757
01:11:53,324 --> 01:11:54,723
Aw, bull!

758
01:11:54,759 --> 01:11:56,989
You think you got
privileged information,

759
01:11:57,028 --> 01:11:59,292
but you don't know squat!

760
01:11:59,330 --> 01:12:00,661
You haven't even been there!

761
01:12:00,698 --> 01:12:02,859
- You shouldn't be there.
- Who's gonna protect you?

762
01:12:02,901 --> 01:12:05,995
- From what?
- What is your problem, Mikey?

763
01:12:06,037 --> 01:12:09,404
Are we the bad guys now?
Am I a bad guy?

764
01:12:14,045 --> 01:12:15,842
Brian?

765
01:12:24,656 --> 01:12:27,454
You don't have boats
or airplanes bringing drugs...

766
01:12:30,628 --> 01:12:32,789
The white man
brings it to Harlem.

767
01:12:32,830 --> 01:12:35,230
The white man
makes you a drug addict,

768
01:12:35,266 --> 01:12:40,135
The white man puts you
in jail for using drugs...

769
01:12:40,171 --> 01:12:44,005
Who controls prostitution in Harlem?
It's the white man.

770
01:12:50,348 --> 01:12:52,179
You don't have any distillery...

771
01:12:57,288 --> 01:12:59,586
We don't put the seal
on that bottle of whiskey.

772
01:12:59,624 --> 01:13:01,956
It's the white man.

773
01:13:14,639 --> 01:13:16,971
We need the paint
on the walls, Emmet.

774
01:13:17,008 --> 01:13:20,102
- Calm down.
- I don't want to calm down.

775
01:13:20,144 --> 01:13:21,839
You hear what they're saying?

776
01:13:21,879 --> 01:13:23,938
That Elijah Muhammed
had him killed.

777
01:13:23,982 --> 01:13:26,041
Like Elijah Muhammed
works for the CIA.

778
01:13:26,084 --> 01:13:29,053
- We'll get the truth, son.
- How we gonna get it?

779
01:13:29,087 --> 01:13:31,885
We ain't never
got it before.

780
01:13:31,923 --> 01:13:33,447
Government's got
no interest in it.

781
01:13:33,491 --> 01:13:36,619
You really think they
wanna see black men free?

782
01:13:36,661 --> 01:13:38,356
That's a lie.

783
01:13:38,396 --> 01:13:42,127
Don't become bitter.
Hatred just drags you down.

784
01:13:42,166 --> 01:13:45,101
You're wrong.
I want bitterness.

785
01:13:45,136 --> 01:13:47,070
Bitterness
gives me strength.

786
01:13:47,105 --> 01:13:51,599
Bitterness ends in chaos,
not freedom.

787
01:13:51,643 --> 01:13:55,739
You remember Paul,
rejected by the disciples?

788
01:13:55,780 --> 01:13:58,476
Tried for heresy at Jerusalem?

789
01:13:58,516 --> 01:14:01,280
Beaten at Thessalonica.

790
01:14:01,319 --> 01:14:03,480
Mobbed at Ephesus.

791
01:14:03,521 --> 01:14:06,581
And still he said,
"Nothing shall separate us

792
01:14:06,624 --> 01:14:07,852
from the love of God."

793
01:14:07,892 --> 01:14:13,228
You made me memorize it.
That's King's sermon.

794
01:14:13,264 --> 01:14:15,960
What did you ever get
for turning the other cheek?

795
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:17,695
Another slap.

796
01:14:20,772 --> 01:14:22,797
Do you really think
being blasted with fire hoses

797
01:14:22,840 --> 01:14:25,308
and beaten
is gonna change anything?

798
01:14:25,343 --> 01:14:30,303
That's a lie!
I'll keep my rage and bitterness...

799
01:14:30,348 --> 01:14:32,043
at least I know they're true.

800
01:14:43,861 --> 01:14:45,658
("Time Of Seasons" plays)

801
01:14:45,697 --> 01:14:49,394
You should come to La Honda.
It's not far away.

802
01:14:49,434 --> 01:14:53,029
Mountain air!
It's gotta be good for "Rainbow".

803
01:14:53,071 --> 01:14:57,030
"Rainbow", are you waiting
for some fresh air?

804
01:14:57,075 --> 01:14:58,406
I think I should be near a doctor.

805
01:14:58,443 --> 01:15:02,436
At Kesey's place there's
gonna be half a dozen midwives.

806
01:15:02,480 --> 01:15:04,107
Tripping...

807
01:15:04,148 --> 01:15:07,709
Yeah, on Owsley acid.
Blue.

808
01:15:07,752 --> 01:15:10,186
You go ahead. If my little friend
decides to come out early,

809
01:15:10,221 --> 01:15:13,122
- I can always catch a ride.
- Cool.

810
01:15:15,793 --> 01:15:17,920
Bye, darlin.

811
01:15:18,696 --> 01:15:22,257
You know the road.
Look for that sign that says,

812
01:15:22,300 --> 01:15:24,359
"No left turn unstoned."

813
01:15:45,022 --> 01:15:47,320
Hi! It's me.

814
01:15:47,358 --> 01:15:49,451
Fine... you?

815
01:15:52,163 --> 01:15:53,994
You sound busy.

816
01:15:55,199 --> 01:15:57,360
I was wondering about Newport...

817
01:15:57,402 --> 01:16:00,166
Should I come into New York
and we take the train together?

818
01:16:05,643 --> 01:16:07,372
Oh...

819
01:16:07,412 --> 01:16:09,972
Does Kenny have any
more room?

820
01:16:12,216 --> 01:16:15,344
No, that's no problem...

821
01:16:15,386 --> 01:16:18,355
I'll meet you there.

822
01:16:18,389 --> 01:16:21,483
Nah, it's no problem.

823
01:16:21,526 --> 01:16:25,826
Okay... Yeah,
I gotta go, too.

824
01:16:27,832 --> 01:16:33,964
So, I guess...
I'll see you there.

825
01:16:34,005 --> 01:16:36,235
I mean, I will.

826
01:16:36,274 --> 01:16:38,401
Okay... Bye.

827
01:17:35,500 --> 01:17:38,094
Sarah? Hey!

828
01:17:38,135 --> 01:17:40,262
Michael!

829
01:17:43,774 --> 01:17:45,799
Did you just get here?

830
01:17:46,644 --> 01:17:50,774
Don't worry about it
Dylan hasn't played yet.

831
01:17:50,815 --> 01:17:52,578
Hey, what's with the amps?

832
01:17:52,617 --> 01:17:55,381
I don't know.
How are you?

833
01:17:55,419 --> 01:17:59,253
- Happy to see you.
- Yeah, me too.

834
01:17:59,290 --> 01:18:01,850
I'm sorry that I haven't
been able to write to you.

835
01:18:05,029 --> 01:18:11,901
I'm really confused
about a lot of stuff right now.

836
01:18:11,936 --> 01:18:16,896
- I'm not.
- I know.

837
01:18:16,941 --> 01:18:18,602
Sarah!

838
01:18:19,610 --> 01:18:22,306
- Michael, how you doin'?
- Hey, Kenny?

839
01:18:22,346 --> 01:18:25,543
Good to see ya.

840
01:18:25,583 --> 01:18:27,448
Look, I got 'em.
I could only get two,

841
01:18:27,485 --> 01:18:29,453
We're gonna have
to catch you later, all right?

842
01:18:30,521 --> 01:18:33,115
Sarah, come on, we're almost on.
Catch you in a bit.

843
01:18:35,960 --> 01:18:37,951
It's Dylan.

844
01:18:57,248 --> 01:18:59,944
- He ain't done nothin'.
- Drunk as a skunk...

845
01:18:59,984 --> 01:19:01,815
You shouldn't
be drinking, sir.

846
01:19:01,852 --> 01:19:06,551
I should be drinkin',
I just shouldn't be drivin'.

847
01:19:06,591 --> 01:19:09,822
I'm gonna have to take you in.
You're drunk.

848
01:19:09,860 --> 01:19:12,454
Aw, c'mon, You ain't got
to take me to no jail.

849
01:19:12,496 --> 01:19:13,963
Yeah, he ain't done nothin!

850
01:19:13,998 --> 01:19:17,126
Go on to jail.
Better'n stayin' with his mama.

851
01:19:17,168 --> 01:19:19,568
- Height?
- Five foot ten.

852
01:19:19,604 --> 01:19:26,100
- Color of hair?
- Black. I'm black all over!

853
01:19:27,878 --> 01:19:32,076
- Marquette?
- Mama, I ain't drunk...

854
01:19:32,116 --> 01:19:34,550
- I can smell it!
- Please don't let 'em take me.

855
01:19:34,585 --> 01:19:36,075
- You ain't even normal!
- But, Mama, I just...

856
01:19:36,120 --> 01:19:37,951
- Get on away from me!
- Mama!

857
01:19:39,523 --> 01:19:41,718
What did you do to my son?
Leave me alone!

858
01:19:45,563 --> 01:19:47,121
What happened?
Did he hit her?

859
01:19:47,164 --> 01:19:48,358
I think he did.

860
01:19:48,399 --> 01:19:50,367
- Let me go!
- The cops beatin' on a woman,

861
01:19:50,401 --> 01:19:52,130
she ain't done nothin' wrong.

862
01:19:52,169 --> 01:19:54,228
L.A.P. D kills somebody
just for bein' black.

863
01:19:54,271 --> 01:19:56,171
What, they killed somebody?

("Like A Rolling Stone" playing)

865
01:21:14,351 --> 01:21:17,445
Here. You're gonna need it, man.
Take it.

866
01:21:40,745 --> 01:21:42,770
Just keep breathing...
Let's go!

867
01:22:11,475 --> 01:22:15,172
I want my mom!

868
01:22:35,366 --> 01:22:37,732
Hey, Emmet!

869
01:22:39,537 --> 01:22:41,004
Put that down.

870
01:22:42,306 --> 01:22:45,104
Put it down now,
I said! Put it down!

871
01:22:48,612 --> 01:22:54,073
Give me that. We're going home.
Give it to me!

872
01:23:08,465 --> 01:23:12,094
Thank God, I found you...
What's the matter with you?

873
01:23:16,240 --> 01:23:18,765
Freeze!
Don't move!

874
01:23:20,044 --> 01:23:20,533
He's got a gun!

875
01:23:30,921 --> 01:23:33,617

Hey, Owl-Man!

878
01:24:58,219 --> 01:25:03,714
I had some Pink last night.
It was freaky...

879
01:25:03,758 --> 01:25:07,660
Like this Navajo desert
sunset landscape.

880
01:25:07,695 --> 01:25:09,754
But the real
cosmic connection

881
01:25:09,797 --> 01:25:11,287
was White Lightning.

882
01:25:11,332 --> 01:25:15,098
It opens the door, man,
like, wide open...

883
01:25:15,136 --> 01:25:19,596
It's like I'm sailin'
down some mexique bay!

White Lightning, man!

May I interest you in a little
after dinner sacra-mint?

886

01:25:44,398 --> 01:25:47,026
...He was supposed to fire me,
but I quit.

888
01:25:48,636 --> 01:25:50,228
Keep an eye out
for the owner.

889
01:25:50,271 --> 01:25:52,501
Don't worry,
I'm the owner.

890

C'mon, it's free.

891
01:26:07,688 --> 01:26:11,749
It's Jimi Hendrix!
Hey Jimi, what's happening?

892
01:26:11,792 --> 01:26:13,521
The name's Emmet.

893
01:26:13,561 --> 01:26:16,155
That's cool, Mr. Hendrix,
you wanna go incognito,

894
01:26:16,197 --> 01:26:17,789
that's all right with me!

895
01:26:17,832 --> 01:26:19,993
I don't even play guitar!

896
01:26:20,034 --> 01:26:23,595
That's a cool disguise!
Thanks for the trip, man.

897
01:26:23,637 --> 01:26:27,937
- Katie, this is Jimi.
- Emmet, shhh!

898
01:26:27,975 --> 01:26:29,602
Sorry, incognito.

899
01:26:29,643 --> 01:26:32,476
- What's your sign?
- Scorpio.

900
01:26:32,513 --> 01:26:37,177
- Far out! Me, too! I knew that!
- Far out!

901
01:27:13,721 --> 01:27:17,418
- What's happenin'?
- Hey, Brother!

902
01:27:17,458 --> 01:27:19,585
A couple of brothers
would like to talk to you.

903
01:27:25,766 --> 01:27:26,858
Huey.

904

I'm Bobby.

- Goin' with it... Dancin'.

906

- With a white bitch!
- You don't like sisters?

907
01:22:53,997 --> 01:22:57,160
No, bro',
sisters are fine.

908
01:22:58,268 --> 01:23:00,600
You tryin' to lay
a trip on somebody?

909
01:23:00,637 --> 01:23:02,298
You picked
the wrong man.

910
01:23:02,339 --> 01:23:07,276
No trips, brother.
Look at yourself.

911
01:23:09,546 --> 01:23:11,639
Look at us.

912
01:23:11,682 --> 01:23:13,343
Who looks like
the white man's clown?

913
01:23:13,383 --> 01:23:15,715
We don't blame you
if you're scared...

914
01:23:15,752 --> 01:23:18,744
Every time a black man
tries to show his pride,

915
01:23:18,789 --> 01:23:21,189
the pig takes him down.

916
01:23:21,224 --> 01:23:24,057
I been there.
I ain't scared.

917
01:23:24,094 --> 01:23:26,688
Then you're just the brother
we're looking for.

918
01:23:59,997 --> 01:24:02,932
- What's goin' on?
- Packing.

919
01:24:02,966 --> 01:24:06,129
- For what?
- The march on the Pentagon.

920
01:24:06,169 --> 01:24:07,761
I told you you aren't!
Not as long

921
01:24:07,804 --> 01:24:10,204
as you live
in this house!

922
01:24:12,142 --> 01:24:14,667
Michael, your brother's
putting his life

923
01:24:14,711 --> 01:24:17,236
on the line
in Vietnam.

924
01:24:18,849 --> 01:24:20,441
You should be
ashamed of yourself!

925
01:24:20,484 --> 01:24:22,475
I'm ashamed of my country
for putting him in that position.

926
01:24:22,519 --> 01:24:25,488
- It's not our war!
- Ashamed of your country?

927
01:24:25,522 --> 01:24:27,717
Is that why
I'm paying your tuition?

928
01:24:27,758 --> 01:24:30,022
So you can turn into
some kind of hippie dropout?

929
01:24:31,495 --> 01:24:34,123
Michael, you can
keep on defying me,

930
01:24:34,164 --> 01:24:37,964
but if you go
on that march...

931
01:24:38,001 --> 01:24:41,937
I can not have you
live in my house!

932
01:24:41,972 --> 01:24:43,439
Your house?

933
01:24:45,008 --> 01:24:47,670
I always thought
it was our house.

934
01:24:51,314 --> 01:24:53,282
We're gonna get the Pentagon
to rise in the air...

935
01:24:53,316 --> 01:24:55,944
And we're gonna
assemble a mass of holy men

936
01:24:55,986 --> 01:24:57,681
And the Pentagon
is gonna rise...

937
01:24:57,721 --> 01:25:00,189
into the air on October 21.

938

We must say "No!"

940
01:25:05,128 --> 01:25:06,459
No!

941
01:25:06,496 --> 01:25:07,656
Are we gonna go?

942
01:25:07,697 --> 01:25:08,959
No!

943
01:25:08,999 --> 01:25:11,229
Hell, no!
We won't go!

944
01:25:11,268 --> 01:25:14,101
Hell, no!
We won't go!

945
01:25:33,190 --> 01:25:34,418
Yeah!

they won't hit the women!

we're against the war!

We're not against
the soldiers...

We mean you
no harm.

- Hey, thanks.

Hey...!

966
01:29:43,239 --> 01:29:45,298
Hey.

01:29:47,444 --> 01:29:53,508
Just wanted to add
my praise to the chorus.

968
01:29:53,550 --> 01:29:58,214
What you did today
was fantastic.

969
01:29:59,622 --> 01:30:04,525
You kept a lot of people
from getting hurt.

970
01:30:06,896 --> 01:30:09,865
Mostly, I was thinking
about one of them.

971
01:30:11,868 --> 01:30:15,702
They would have
started clubbing people.

972
01:30:15,739 --> 01:30:18,264
That's what they do!
I can't believe Kenny put you up front!

973
01:30:18,308 --> 01:30:19,400
That was crazy!

974
01:30:19,442 --> 01:30:24,004
It's not crazy.
It's what gets on the news.

975
01:30:24,047 --> 01:30:27,073
What doesn't get on
the news doesn't count.

976
01:30:27,117 --> 01:30:29,176
The proceeding has been
a paid political announcement

977
01:30:29,219 --> 01:30:31,210

978
01:30:32,222 --> 01:30:34,782
I truly believe
he's gonna change the world.

979

While you get
your heads kicked in!

980
01:30:36,626 --> 01:30:39,424
That's not true.
He cares about people.

981
01:30:39,462 --> 01:30:40,952
In the abstract, maybe.

982
01:30:40,997 --> 01:30:43,295
- You don't even know him!
- I know guys like him...

983
01:30:43,333 --> 01:30:47,292
they all love humanity
except face to face.

984
01:31:18,802 --> 01:31:20,827
Are you crying?

985
01:31:22,639 --> 01:31:24,937
I think it's tear gas.

986
01:31:28,111 --> 01:31:31,103
I thought it was love.

987
01:31:37,086 --> 01:31:40,522
Maybe it's just easier
for some people

988
01:31:40,557 --> 01:31:45,017
to give themselves over
to a cause.

989

Sure, broken heads heal,
broken hearts -

990
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:52,459
I'm talking
about ideals, Michael!

991
01:31:52,502 --> 01:31:55,869
No, you're just
talking about ideas.

992
01:31:55,905 --> 01:32:00,672
I'm talking about people.
Two people.

of the hippie subculture...

994
01:32:25,168 --> 01:32:29,537
The hippie's is often
a strange world...

995
01:32:29,572 --> 01:32:31,039
they take many trips...

996
01:32:33,476 --> 01:32:38,743
and the trip of the hippies
is generally an unusual one.

Come to Mama Earth.
Come here, sweetheart.

1003
01:33:00,336 --> 01:33:01,826
- I'll take him.
- Thank you.

1004
01:33:03,940 --> 01:33:07,671
- I need some money.
- I don't think it's enough...

1005
01:33:11,714 --> 01:33:16,117
- it's six bucks.
- That's all you've got?

1006
01:33:16,152 --> 01:33:20,589
I know it's a drag,
but you can take it.

1007
01:33:20,623 --> 01:33:24,684
I thought you guys
had a lot of gigs.

1008
01:33:24,727 --> 01:33:28,424
We mostly play
for drinks.

1009

I just bought that lid,
it's good stuff,

1010
01:33:31,401 --> 01:33:32,834
do you want
some of it?

1011
01:33:32,869 --> 01:33:35,565
No, I don't!
I need to get medicine!

1012
01:33:38,107 --> 01:33:41,565
That guy from KSAN
likes our stuff...

1013
01:33:41,611 --> 01:33:43,704
maybe we could
get money gigs from him.

1014
01:33:45,081 --> 01:33:48,710
Did you ever think about
getting a real job?

1015
01:33:48,751 --> 01:33:53,688
Are you gonna bum me out
over jobs again, Katie?

to avoid all bad vibes.

to fill these petitions

on the ballot for Illinois.

opposition to the war...

01:35:07,296 --> 01:35:09,787
I always imagined
something a little more

1036
01:35:09,832 --> 01:35:11,732
Jackie Kennedy
for my life.

1037
01:35:11,768 --> 01:35:14,202
You don't think she does
John-John's laundry?

1038
01:35:14,237 --> 01:35:17,229
Oh, I'm sure she does.

1039
01:35:17,273 --> 01:35:19,833
Wanna sign the petition?

1040
01:35:20,710 --> 01:35:21,472
Whatever it is...

1041
01:35:21,511 --> 01:35:23,206
you know what
your father would say.

1042
01:35:23,246 --> 01:35:24,611
What about what
you wanna say?

1043
01:35:24,647 --> 01:35:26,046
Or does that
not matter?

1044
01:35:26,082 --> 01:35:28,915
Of course it does.
But I've tried my whole life

1045
01:35:28,951 --> 01:35:31,613
to make our home
as pleasant as possible...

1046
01:35:31,654 --> 01:35:33,986
Not every issue
is worth fighting for.

1047
01:35:34,023 --> 01:35:37,390
This is for McCarthy.
To end the war...

1048
01:35:37,427 --> 01:35:39,190
to get Brian back home,
is that worth fighting for?

1049
01:35:39,228 --> 01:35:40,718
I'm home!

1050
01:35:48,705 --> 01:35:51,367
There's a letter
from Brian.

1051
01:35:58,715 --> 01:36:01,707
Listen to this.

1052
01:36:01,751 --> 01:36:05,517
"Dear Mom and Dad,
I hear the news on TV sounds grim.

1053
01:36:05,555 --> 01:36:08,524
Don't believe it!

1054
01:36:08,558 --> 01:36:12,619
This ain't a Hilton,
but I'm warm and dry.

1055
01:36:12,662 --> 01:36:14,152
Compared to what
Dad went through...

1056
01:36:14,197 --> 01:36:18,725
Khe Sanh's a walk in the park
on a sunny day!

1057
01:36:18,768 --> 01:36:21,464
See you all in
about six months...

1058
01:36:21,504 --> 01:36:23,734
Have you heard from Katie?

1059
01:36:23,773 --> 01:36:25,832
Love to all. Brian."

1060
01:36:28,177 --> 01:36:33,479
Did you hear that?
He's just fine.

1061
01:36:33,516 --> 01:36:37,008
What do you think of that,
"Mister Clean for Gene"?

1062
01:36:41,224 --> 01:36:44,193
- What the hell is that?
- My name.

1063
01:36:44,227 --> 01:36:47,253
I can see that.
On a McCarthy petition?

1064
01:36:48,164 --> 01:36:51,565
What the hell
is going on here?

1065
01:36:51,601 --> 01:36:56,163
You know, Bill,
you have your opinions...

1066
01:36:56,205 --> 01:36:59,072
and I respect
those opinions.

1067
01:36:59,108 --> 01:37:01,599
Even if I don't
always agree with them.

1068
01:37:03,813 --> 01:37:09,513
I expect you to show me
the same kind of respect.

1069
01:37:16,259 --> 01:37:18,819
The most intelligent volunteers
in the history

1070
01:37:18,861 --> 01:37:22,422
of American politics...
(cheering)

1071
01:37:43,085 --> 01:37:44,109
Spare change?
Spare change?

1072
01:37:48,791 --> 01:37:51,419
- Bummer, huh?
- Spare change...?

1073
01:37:51,460 --> 01:37:53,428
Used to be you could get
whatever you needed

1074
01:37:53,462 --> 01:37:57,421
right here on the streets,
not now, man.

1075
01:37:57,466 --> 01:38:01,266
It's gotten really weird,
really dark.

1076
01:38:01,304 --> 01:38:02,669
(cries)

1077
01:38:02,705 --> 01:38:07,199
Used to be like,
somewhere over the rainbow.

1078
01:38:07,944 --> 01:38:11,937
Now it's just...
somewhere.

1079
01:38:15,017 --> 01:38:17,645
- You have to be careful, man...
- Spare change?

1080
01:38:17,687 --> 01:38:19,712
You gotta be really
careful because...

1081
01:38:19,755 --> 01:38:23,156
they're cuttin' the stuff.
It's... evil, man.

1082
01:38:23,192 --> 01:38:24,625
It's not for me...

1083
01:38:24,660 --> 01:38:27,128
I just need to get some money
to turn the gas back on...

1084
01:38:27,163 --> 01:38:29,631
and get some food 'cause
my baby's sick.

1085
01:38:34,737 --> 01:38:38,332
- Spare change...?
- Negativity... negativity.

1086
01:38:42,545 --> 01:38:47,312
There's a place,
you can make 10 dollars an hour.

1087
01:38:47,817 --> 01:38:51,947
- Max's.
- What do I have to do?

1088
01:38:51,988 --> 01:38:55,549
- Dance.
- I can dance...

1089
01:38:55,591 --> 01:39:00,722
Close you eyes,
and feel the love.

1090
01:39:07,837 --> 01:39:10,305
Despite all our
reports of progress...

1091
01:39:10,339 --> 01:39:13,103
of government strength
and enemy weakness...

1092
01:39:13,142 --> 01:39:15,633
that half a million
American soldiers...

1093
01:39:15,678 --> 01:39:19,136
with 700 thousand
Vietnamese allies...

1094
01:39:19,181 --> 01:39:21,945
That we are unable
to secure even a single city...

1095
01:39:21,984 --> 01:39:25,010
from the attacks of an enemy
whose total strength

1096
01:39:25,054 --> 01:39:27,079
is about 250 thousand.

1097
01:39:30,359 --> 01:39:35,854
Lyndon Johnson: With America's
future under challenge here at home...

1098
01:39:35,898 --> 01:39:39,561
with our hopes and
the world's hopes for peace

1099
01:39:39,602 --> 01:39:42,662
in the balance every day...

1100
01:39:42,705 --> 01:39:46,664
I do not believe
I should devote my time...

1101
01:39:49,512 --> 01:39:56,350
to any partisan causes,
or duties other than

1102
01:39:56,385 --> 01:40:00,651
the awesome duties
of this office...

1103
01:40:00,690 --> 01:40:04,319
of presidency of your country.

1104
01:40:04,360 --> 01:40:06,555
Accordingly...

1105
01:40:06,595 --> 01:40:12,534
I shall not seek,
and I will not accept...

1106
01:40:12,568 --> 01:40:15,628
the nomination of my party
for another term...

1107
01:40:15,671 --> 01:40:18,139
as your president.

1108
01:40:18,174 --> 01:40:21,507
God, I can't believe it!

1109
01:40:29,151 --> 01:40:31,847
I love you.

1110
01:40:34,590 --> 01:40:37,115
I'd better put a towel
under the door.

1111
01:40:47,503 --> 01:40:50,063
One for the good guys.

1112
01:40:58,881 --> 01:41:01,941
Life can be beautiful.

1113
01:41:12,361 --> 01:41:16,092
...And the hope of the prospects
of peace for all.

1114
01:41:21,704 --> 01:41:25,663
("Double Shot of
My Baby's Love" playing)

1115
01:41:43,759 --> 01:41:47,593
That was great.
The crowd really liked it.

1116
01:41:47,630 --> 01:41:50,064
A customer would like
to thank you personal.

1117
01:41:50,099 --> 01:41:51,896
How personal?

1118
01:41:51,934 --> 01:41:56,530
Relax. This is a public place.
Smile. Make nice.

1119
01:42:05,815 --> 01:42:10,252
You know,
you are truly beautiful.

1120
01:42:13,222 --> 01:42:15,122
What's this for?

1121
01:42:15,157 --> 01:42:18,149
A gesture of appreciation.

1122
01:42:20,896 --> 01:42:23,831
How much do you want
for a private show?

1123
01:42:23,866 --> 01:42:25,561
I already did my show.

1124
01:42:32,174 --> 01:42:34,938
I quit!

1125
01:42:39,715 --> 01:42:41,876
(sniffling)

1126
01:42:41,917 --> 01:42:44,943
Rainbow, I'm gonna make you
a promise, okay?

1127
01:42:44,987 --> 01:42:49,356
But it's just between
you and me and God.

1128
01:42:49,391 --> 01:42:54,294
I'm gonna take this money and
find us a clean bed tonight.

1129
01:42:54,330 --> 01:42:57,060
Then I'm gonna find us a warm,
safe place to stay...

1130
01:42:57,099 --> 01:43:01,297
for as long as we want.
I don't know where...

1131
01:43:01,337 --> 01:43:04,500
but we are never gonna
spend another night

1132
01:43:04,540 --> 01:43:07,941
on a stranger's couch
or on the street. Okay?

1133
01:43:07,977 --> 01:43:11,572
I promise you that.
I swear to God.

1134
01:43:16,585 --> 01:43:19,076
Hey!!

1135
01:43:20,322 --> 01:43:24,349
It's okay... it's okay.
Shhh...

1136
01:43:26,362 --> 01:43:30,355
Don't cry, don't cry.
It's okay...

1137
01:43:30,733 --> 01:43:32,667
(ringing)

1138
01:43:37,907 --> 01:43:41,274
- Who is it?
- Mom? Mom, it's me, Katie.

1139
01:43:41,310 --> 01:43:46,680
Katie! Tell me,
where the hell are you?

1140
01:43:46,715 --> 01:43:49,115
Give me the phone, Bill!
Katie, it's Mom...

1141
01:43:49,151 --> 01:43:51,984
- Mom...!
- Katie, don't hang up.

1142
01:43:52,922 --> 01:43:54,981
"Please deposit another
10 cents..."

1143
01:43:55,024 --> 01:43:56,787
Katie, don't you hang up!

1144
01:43:56,825 --> 01:43:59,658
Excuse me,
do you have a dime?

1145
01:43:59,695 --> 01:44:03,426
Hare, hare,
Krishna...

1146
01:44:03,465 --> 01:44:06,662
- Wait...!
- Katie!

1147
01:44:08,204 --> 01:44:11,640
"Please deposit ten cents..."
Mom, hold on!

1148
01:44:11,674 --> 01:44:15,007
I'm sorry,
I must disconnect your call.

1149
01:44:22,117 --> 01:44:27,783
That was Katie, Bill!
That was Katie.

1150
01:44:36,131 --> 01:44:40,090
Peace and love, my ass!
I hate this damn city!

1151
01:44:40,135 --> 01:44:43,002
I am announcing my candidacy

1152
01:44:43,038 --> 01:44:45,438
for the Presidency
of the United States.

1153
01:44:47,109 --> 01:44:51,842
Like anybody, I would like
to live a long life...

1154
01:44:51,880 --> 01:44:55,714
Longevity has its place...

1155
01:44:55,751 --> 01:44:58,219
But I'm not concerned
about that now.

1156
01:44:58,254 --> 01:45:00,950
I just want to
do God's will.

1157
01:45:00,990 --> 01:45:05,051
And he's allowed me
to go up to the mountain...

1158
01:45:05,094 --> 01:45:13,627
And I've looked over and
I have seen the Promised Land.

1159
01:45:13,669 --> 01:45:15,261
I may not get there with you...

1160
01:45:15,304 --> 01:45:17,329
but I want you
to know tonight...

1161
01:45:20,209 --> 01:45:24,976
that we as a people
will get to the Promised Land!

1162
01:45:25,014 --> 01:45:28,575
I'm happy tonight,
I'm not worried about anything...

1163
01:45:28,617 --> 01:45:33,384
I'm not fearing any man.
Mine eyes have seen the glory

1164
01:45:33,422 --> 01:45:35,652
of the coming of the Lord!

1165
01:45:49,238 --> 01:45:51,536
("Volunteers" playing)

1166
01:45:55,911 --> 01:45:59,312
...local residents,
mostly black...

1167
01:45:59,348 --> 01:46:03,876
can enter through the back with
a separate pool to swim in!

1168
01:46:03,919 --> 01:46:06,012
It's obscene!

1169
01:46:06,055 --> 01:46:07,818
Are you gonna
allow this to happen?

1170
01:46:07,856 --> 01:46:09,050
No!

1171
01:46:09,091 --> 01:46:11,218
Is this how we
want our school?

1172
01:46:11,260 --> 01:46:12,284
- No!
- Okay.

1173
01:46:12,328 --> 01:46:15,058
Our black brothers have already
occupied Harrison Hall.

1174
01:46:15,097 --> 01:46:19,431
Let's take
this school back, guys!

1175

President Kirk.
Let's pay him a little visit.

1176
01:46:52,601 --> 01:46:55,331
Now this is an office
I can get some work done in!

1177
01:46:55,371 --> 01:46:57,464
"This is President Grayson Kirk,
I hereby resign.

1178
01:46:57,506 --> 01:46:59,736
Hold all my calls."

1179
01:46:59,775 --> 01:47:03,142
What's on the agenda?
Yes! Presents for the family!

1180
01:47:03,178 --> 01:47:06,807
Here you go, kids.
Smoke 'em of you got 'em.

1181
01:47:06,849 --> 01:47:09,511
A couple for
Grayson himself...

1182
01:47:09,551 --> 01:47:11,610
Sarah, very nice.
Sherry, darling?

1183
01:47:11,653 --> 01:47:13,382
Yes, darling!

1184
01:47:15,758 --> 01:47:18,022
Sarah, I want you in charge of
the mayo committee.

1185
01:47:18,060 --> 01:47:22,724
- The what?
- Mayonnaise. We got people to feed.

1186
01:47:22,765 --> 01:47:26,360
- Screw you!
- No, this is a very important job...

1187
01:47:26,402 --> 01:47:28,870
You've got to keep it cool.

1188
01:47:28,904 --> 01:47:30,963
If that stuff spoils,
this whole strike is over.

1189
01:47:31,006 --> 01:47:32,997
This is a life-and-death
assignment!

1190
01:47:33,041 --> 01:47:37,171
Hot dog committee,
pizza committee, hamburger...

1191
01:47:39,248 --> 01:47:41,842
I declare this building
liberated!

1193

The news has arrived!

1194
01:48:06,141 --> 01:48:09,338
We want the university
to behave responsibly.

1195
01:48:11,046 --> 01:48:13,981
To act as a good neighbor!
Live up to the ideals

1196

that have been the school's
primary franchise

1197
01:48:16,285 --> 01:48:22,884
since it was created in 1754!
That is hardly revolutionary!

1198
01:48:22,925 --> 01:48:23,619
What?

1199
01:48:23,659 --> 01:48:25,923
The Alumni Association
wants a list of demands.

1200
01:48:25,961 --> 01:48:28,054
They think they can help get
the administration to listen.

1201
01:48:28,096 --> 01:48:33,659
The Alumni Association?
I've got NBC out here.

wants a story.

1203
01:48:35,771 --> 01:48:37,602
Abbie Hoffman's
called three times.

1204
01:48:37,639 --> 01:48:39,869
SDS at Berkeley wants to
know what they can do,

1205
01:48:39,908 --> 01:48:43,776
the Alumni Association
will have to wait in line,

1206
01:48:43,812 --> 01:48:46,975
and to be honest,
so will you.

1207
01:48:49,485 --> 01:48:53,012
What? Do you have something
to say to the press?

1208
01:48:53,055 --> 01:48:54,647
What if I do?

1209
01:48:54,690 --> 01:48:57,591
That's really difficult
for you to imagine.

1210
01:48:57,626 --> 01:49:00,288
You think "mayonnaise"
is pretty much it for me?

1211
01:49:00,329 --> 01:49:03,389
I've been doing this
for a while too, Kenny...

1212
01:49:03,432 --> 01:49:06,959
Yes, I have
some things to say.

1213
01:49:07,002 --> 01:49:09,163
But no one gets a chance
to talk when you're around.

1214
01:49:09,204 --> 01:49:14,005
I don't have time
to talk about this... crap.

1215
01:49:14,042 --> 01:49:18,570
I've got that list
of demands from... who?

1216
01:49:18,614 --> 01:49:21,879
- The Alumni Association.
- Yeah, so...

1217
01:49:25,854 --> 01:49:29,051
Strike! Strike!
Strike! Strike!

1218
01:49:30,826 --> 01:49:33,590
("Nature's Way" playing)

1219
01:50:53,542 --> 01:50:55,339
Right up against the door!

1220
01:51:43,492 --> 01:51:47,553
Where are you taking him?
You've no right to do this!

1221
01:51:47,596 --> 01:51:49,325
This is an
illegal police action!

1222
01:51:49,364 --> 01:51:52,026
- What happened?
- We were sitting on those steps.

1223
01:51:52,067 --> 01:51:54,831
We were exercising
our right to free assembly...

1224
01:51:54,870 --> 01:51:57,600
and the police
assaulted us!

1225
01:51:59,041 --> 01:52:01,635
- What?
- Shhh!

1226
01:52:01,677 --> 01:52:03,804
We didn't come to tear
down a great university...

1227
01:52:03,845 --> 01:52:07,076
- we're here to build a greater one!
- Who is that?

1228
01:52:07,115 --> 01:52:09,242
Columbia's president might
live in a mansion...

1229
01:52:09,284 --> 01:52:12,617
his bedroom overlooks a ghetto!

1230
01:52:12,654 --> 01:52:18,251
A ghetto he helped create
through unfair labor practices!

1231
01:52:18,293 --> 01:52:22,491
We came to get an education.
Have we ever.

1232
01:52:22,531 --> 01:52:28,697
Those who run this university
care only about money.

1233
01:52:28,737 --> 01:52:32,332
The same disease that has
infected our university,

1234
01:52:32,374 --> 01:52:36,470
has infected our
whole entire society!

1235
01:52:36,511 --> 01:52:40,709
Justice and freedom
are the only cure.

1236
01:52:40,749 --> 01:52:43,343
Up against
the wall, mothers!

1237
01:52:54,162 --> 01:52:58,861
We're the Hog Farm!
We'll feed em, body and soul.

1238
01:52:58,900 --> 01:53:01,425
And they want us
to do some kinda security.

1239
01:53:01,470 --> 01:53:03,734
How're we supposed
to do that, man?

1240
01:53:03,772 --> 01:53:07,003
- Cream pies and seltzer bottles.
- Hey, Katie!

1241
01:53:07,042 --> 01:53:10,375
Michael Rainbow!
Pull into the barn.

1242
01:53:13,949 --> 01:53:16,679
Katie, welcome
to the Hog Farm.

1243
01:53:18,553 --> 01:53:20,077
Welcome home.

1244
01:53:30,332 --> 01:53:33,961
No refined sugars.
It tastes sawdusty at first.

1245
01:53:34,002 --> 01:53:38,735
But you'll get used to it.
Do you wanna help out?

1246
01:53:38,774 --> 01:53:41,265
I'm afraid I'm
not much of a cook.

1247
01:53:41,309 --> 01:53:47,248
There's sewing, cleaning,
pulling weeds... What?

1248
01:53:47,282 --> 01:53:50,945
Woman's work? I'm closer
to Chicago than I thought.

1249
01:53:52,888 --> 01:53:55,379
What do the guys
do around here?

1250
01:53:55,423 --> 01:53:57,357
They just do their thing.

1251
01:53:58,160 --> 01:54:00,424
You're tellin' me
you can't tell the difference

1252
01:54:00,462 --> 01:54:06,059
between 300 porta-potties
and 300 cucumbers?

1253
01:54:16,611 --> 01:54:18,636
Boy, those look good.

1254
01:54:19,915 --> 01:54:21,712
You okay?

1255
01:54:23,351 --> 01:54:26,411
I just realized that
I've been holding my breath

1256
01:54:26,454 --> 01:54:28,820
for the past three years.

1257
01:54:28,857 --> 01:54:35,194
I know... I know.
But our hero's home, now.

1258
01:54:36,631 --> 01:54:40,727
Everything's gonna be fine,
from here on in.

1259
01:54:45,340 --> 01:54:48,207
Hey, he's here!

1260
01:56:19,567 --> 01:56:22,400
The barriers that exist
between black and white,

1261
01:56:22,437 --> 01:56:24,632
the poor and
those more affluent...

1262
01:56:29,711 --> 01:56:32,339
We can start working together,
blacks and whites,

1263
01:56:32,380 --> 01:56:34,280
Indians and
Mexican-Americans...

1264
01:56:34,316 --> 01:56:38,616
replace the hate and
distrust in the United States

1265
01:56:38,653 --> 01:56:40,678
with compassion
and understanding...

1266
01:56:49,030 --> 01:56:52,022
(telephone rings)

1267
01:56:52,067 --> 01:56:55,969
- Hello?
- Hi, it's me. Michael.

1268
01:56:56,004 --> 01:57:01,567
- Michael, hi.
- It feels like it's been forever.

1269
01:57:01,609 --> 01:57:05,136
I saw that thing at Columbia.
That was... cool.

1270
01:57:05,180 --> 01:57:08,547
I can't believe
you actually saw that.

1271
01:57:08,583 --> 01:57:13,418
So I just wanted to touch base.
Everything good?

1272
01:57:13,455 --> 01:57:17,357
Yeah. Everything's great.
How about you?

1273
01:57:17,392 --> 01:57:18,654
Good.

1274
01:57:21,363 --> 01:57:24,332
So... did you see
Kennedy at the Garden?

1275
01:57:24,366 --> 01:57:27,665
- No, I missed it.
- That's too bad.

1276
01:57:35,143 --> 01:57:37,111
Are you coming here
for the convention?

1277
01:57:37,145 --> 01:57:39,739
I don't know.
It depends on school.

1278
01:57:43,585 --> 01:57:45,075
How's Kenny?

1279
01:57:48,590 --> 01:57:50,023
Okay.

1280
01:57:53,261 --> 01:57:55,252
I miss you, too. Michael.

1281
01:57:56,531 --> 01:57:58,726
I hope I can get there.

1282
01:58:00,969 --> 01:58:02,732
Bye.

1283
01:58:23,892 --> 01:58:28,226
Another nightmare.
He's back to sleep.

1284
01:58:28,263 --> 01:58:30,788
You think he's going
to be all right?

1285
01:58:30,832 --> 01:58:31,662
Yeah.

1286
01:58:41,676 --> 01:58:44,577
What happened to
"Clean for Gene"?

1287
01:58:44,612 --> 01:58:47,638
Decide you want your
vote to count?

1288
01:58:47,682 --> 01:58:49,445
That's radical.

1289
01:58:49,484 --> 01:58:54,319
- How's Bri?
- Good. He's good.

1290
01:58:59,394 --> 01:59:02,192
American people in general,
black people in particular,

1291
01:59:02,230 --> 01:59:05,893
take careful note of
the racist California legislature

1292
01:59:05,934 --> 01:59:09,301
now considering legislation
aimed at keeping

1293
01:59:09,337 --> 01:59:12,465
black people disarmed and
powerless at the same time

1294
01:59:12,507 --> 01:59:15,374
racist police agencies
throughout the country

1295
01:59:15,410 --> 01:59:18,937
are intensifying the terror,
brutality, murder

1296
01:59:18,980 --> 01:59:21,676
and repression
of black people.

1297
01:59:21,716 --> 01:59:23,707
I don't see why the Panthers
should go to Chicago.

1298
01:59:27,589 --> 01:59:29,784
The only issue they're
concerned with is the war.

1299
01:59:29,824 --> 01:59:32,588
- That's not our issue.
- It's everyone's issue.

1300
01:59:32,627 --> 01:59:35,357
Peace is where
the revolution starts.

1301
01:59:35,396 --> 01:59:37,364
It could change the
economy of this country.

1302
01:59:37,398 --> 01:59:38,797
Which is what
we are tryin' to do.

1303
01:59:38,833 --> 01:59:41,529
Brother, please!
Do you really think any whites

1304
01:59:41,569 --> 01:59:44,003
see peace in those terms?

1305
01:59:44,038 --> 01:59:46,700
I don't think they consider
the impact on blacks at all.

1306
01:59:46,741 --> 01:59:48,868
You're thinking that
blacks are only being colonized,

1307
01:59:48,910 --> 01:59:51,071
but it's everyone!
The whole country.

1308
01:59:51,112 --> 01:59:52,704
Besides, the convention
is big time,

1309
01:59:52,747 --> 01:59:54,840
we could use some
of that right now.

1310
01:59:54,883 --> 01:59:57,943
You'll get a chance
to meet Fred Hampton.

1311
02:00:03,358 --> 02:00:05,758
Speech! - Shhh!

1312
02:00:07,262 --> 02:00:09,992
I was a campaign manager,
I know what a difference

1313
02:00:10,031 --> 02:00:12,966
that kind of effort
and commitment makes.

1314
02:00:13,001 --> 02:00:15,128
I thank
all of you...

1315
02:00:15,170 --> 02:00:17,468
Now it's on to Chicago
and let's win there!

1316
02:00:23,878 --> 02:00:26,938
Kennedy! Kennedy!
Kennedy! Kennedy!

1317
02:00:28,082 --> 02:00:30,175
(screams)

1318
02:00:54,976 --> 02:00:58,571
("For What It's Worth" playing)

1319
02:01:27,575 --> 02:01:29,600
The final votes were
coming in from

1320
02:01:29,644 --> 02:01:31,544
remote precincts
of the state...

1321
02:01:31,579 --> 02:01:33,843
swelling the count
the Senator had established

1322
02:01:33,881 --> 02:01:35,815
in this state
only two days ago.

1323
02:01:35,850 --> 02:01:39,650
He won the election,
tasted briefly the fruits

1324
02:01:39,687 --> 02:01:41,985
of achievement,
and then lost his life.

1325
02:01:50,965 --> 02:01:52,296
How do I look?

1326
02:01:52,333 --> 02:01:56,667
Like the circus left town
and forgot the clown.

1327
02:01:56,704 --> 02:01:58,638
I'll take that
as a complement.

1328
02:02:00,408 --> 02:02:04,344
- Hey, sweetheart...
- Hi, Mom.

1329
02:02:04,379 --> 02:02:07,576
Who's your candidate
this week. Nixon?

1330
02:02:07,615 --> 02:02:09,742
If you keep it up,
that's what you'll get.

1331
02:02:09,784 --> 02:02:13,777
- That what you want?
- Not looking for a fight,

1332
02:02:13,821 --> 02:02:16,654
I just came to give
Bri a ride to the VA.

1333
02:02:17,925 --> 02:02:21,258
Hey, Bri! Why don't you
clean up and come with me?

1334
02:02:22,597 --> 02:02:26,693
It's kind of a circus,
but it's democracy in action.

1335
02:02:26,734 --> 02:02:29,567
It's what you fought for.

1336
02:02:40,748 --> 02:02:44,912
- I need my appointment today.
- Okay.

1337
02:02:48,923 --> 02:02:51,255
We are all under attack!

1338
02:02:51,292 --> 02:02:55,092
America has decided
to devour it's youth!

1339
02:02:55,129 --> 02:02:57,723
We will resist!
We will not participate

1340
02:02:57,765 --> 02:03:01,360
in America's "Children
for Breakfast" program!

1341
02:03:09,944 --> 02:03:13,072
("Chicago" playing)

1342
02:03:56,424 --> 02:03:59,689
Sarah, would you
do me a favor?

1343
02:04:01,696 --> 02:04:04,756
Make up a couple hundred
copies of these.

1344
02:04:04,799 --> 02:04:07,199
I thought we
already had these.

1345
02:04:07,235 --> 02:04:10,534
No. Somebody screwed up.
Thanks.

1346
02:04:10,571 --> 02:04:12,664
- Hi, Kenny...
- Hey, man.

1347
02:04:12,707 --> 02:04:16,074
- Kenny!
- Hi, Michael. Good to see you.

1348
02:04:16,110 --> 02:04:18,840
- Sarah here?
- Yeah, somewhere.

1349
02:04:20,748 --> 02:04:24,149
Bobby Seale? Kenny Klein.
Thanks for coming.

1350
02:04:24,185 --> 02:04:26,085
We're gonna
put you on, right?

1351
02:04:26,120 --> 02:04:27,747
Chairman Seale will only
be here a couple of hours.

1352
02:04:27,789 --> 02:04:29,620
He's agreed to lend Panther
support against the war...

1353
02:04:29,657 --> 02:04:31,249
we have to decide
when he speaks.

1354
02:04:31,292 --> 02:04:34,159
- Kenny?
- That's fine, just a second...

1355
02:04:35,196 --> 02:04:36,686
Mayor Daley won't
extend the park permit.

1356
02:04:36,731 --> 02:04:37,925
It expires at
11 o'clock.

1357
02:04:37,965 --> 02:04:39,956
Screw the permit!
We got bodies, lots of 'em.

1358
02:04:40,001 --> 02:04:41,593
This is supposed to be
a peaceful protest,

1359
02:04:41,636 --> 02:04:43,433
anything besides,
I'm gonna lose a set of liberals!

1360
02:04:43,471 --> 02:04:45,962
That is the point.

1361
02:04:46,007 --> 02:04:48,999
Who better to polarize the undecided
than a pig with a billy club?

1362
02:04:49,043 --> 02:04:50,943
You making a decision
that affects the welfare

1363
02:04:50,978 --> 02:04:52,912
of people who haven't
agreed to any such thing!

1364
02:04:52,947 --> 02:04:55,313
So we do nothing,
and let the Vietnamese wake up

1365
02:04:55,349 --> 02:04:57,374
to another day of
napalm and carpet bombing?

1366
02:04:57,418 --> 02:04:59,443
- Maybe we should vote.
- We don't have time,

1367
02:04:59,487 --> 02:05:00,579
you wanna tell these people

doing here?

democracy in action.

Follow me, Brian.

I don't know if
this is a good idea.

1376
02:05:20,208 --> 02:05:23,507
It's not an idea, just tell
the people what you know.

to do this, do you?

America's fighting men.

would like to talk to you.

02:26:04,250 --> 02:26:07,276
You know it, too.

1536
02:26:07,320 --> 02:26:08,412
So what's wrong?

1537
02:26:08,455 --> 02:26:11,618
You know the kind of relationship
I've been in for the past few years.

1538
02:26:11,658 --> 02:26:16,254
- Yeah. Shallow and meaningless.
- I'm serious.

1539
02:26:16,296 --> 02:26:18,696
When I spoke at Columbia...

1540
02:26:19,733 --> 02:26:21,462
...that was me.

1541
02:26:22,502 --> 02:26:24,060
That was my voice...

1542
02:26:24,104 --> 02:26:28,871
I can't give that up, Michael!
I don't want to be a shadow!

1543
02:26:28,908 --> 02:26:31,672
That's not what I'm about,
I don't want a shadow...

1544
02:26:31,711 --> 02:26:35,203
you must have me confused
with somebody else!

1545
02:26:36,349 --> 02:26:39,284
I'm a mess.
I'm not much good to myself.

1546
02:26:39,319 --> 02:26:42,083
I'm not going to be any good
to anybody else.

1547
02:26:46,893 --> 02:26:54,095
What I need more than anything
else right now, is a friend.

1548
02:26:57,337 --> 02:27:00,238
A... a friend...?

1549
02:27:03,576 --> 02:27:05,441
A friend.

1550
02:27:09,749 --> 02:27:16,177
Let me give you a little
friendly insight... friend.

1551
02:27:16,222 --> 02:27:18,019
The problem is...

1552
02:27:18,057 --> 02:27:20,218
It wasn't real with Kenny,
he just kept you busy.

1553
02:27:20,260 --> 02:27:24,390
With me, it's real, and you
don't wanna deal with that!

1554
02:27:25,398 --> 02:27:27,127
You don't have to go.

1555
02:27:28,501 --> 02:27:30,731
Yeah, I do.

1556
02:27:33,373 --> 02:27:36,399
I've loved you
for a long time, Sarah...

1557
02:27:38,244 --> 02:27:41,111
and I think I have to give up.

1558
02:27:42,282 --> 02:27:45,911
- Don't give up.
- Why?

1559
02:27:47,554 --> 02:27:49,454
Because...

1560
02:27:52,125 --> 02:27:55,151
"She breaks just like
a little girl".

1561
02:27:57,697 --> 02:27:59,597
Bye, Sarah.

1562
02:28:11,644 --> 02:28:15,876
I don't know whether to stay here
or go back to Oakland.

1563
02:28:15,915 --> 02:28:19,248
You came to your consciousness
out of the Oakland scene.

1564
02:28:19,285 --> 02:28:23,483
Huey and Bobby took a militant
stance to establish the party.

1565
02:28:23,523 --> 02:28:26,321
They also started a roots thing,
workin' in the community.

1566
02:28:26,359 --> 02:28:30,125
- For me, that's most important.
- That's what I grew up with.

1567
02:28:30,163 --> 02:28:32,654
Why are you having such
a difficult time figuring out

1568
02:28:32,699 --> 02:28:34,360
which way to go?

1569
02:28:34,400 --> 02:28:36,095
Lemme tell you something...

1570
02:28:36,135 --> 02:28:39,127
you're not gonna find your way
back to your papa with hatred.

1571
02:28:39,172 --> 02:28:40,935
Hatred will fool you.

1572
02:28:40,974 --> 02:28:42,839
Trick you into looking
for the cop who killed him...

1573
02:28:42,876 --> 02:28:44,867
Trick you into
looking for any cop.

1574
02:28:44,911 --> 02:28:46,845
Trick you into looking
for any white man.

1575
02:28:46,880 --> 02:28:48,245
Come the end of the day,

1576
02:28:48,281 --> 02:28:50,806
you won't be
any closer to your father.

1577
02:29:11,671 --> 02:29:15,573
("Season Of The Witch" playing)

1578
02:29:18,177 --> 02:29:20,338
(knocking)

1579
02:29:32,592 --> 02:29:34,150
Sarah.

1580
02:29:42,669 --> 02:29:44,261
Here. Take a hit?

1581
02:29:44,304 --> 02:29:47,068
Note said you were desperate, Kenny.
What do you want?

1582
02:29:50,176 --> 02:29:54,237
What do you think I want, Sarah?
Princess?

1583
02:29:56,449 --> 02:29:58,679
I would have sent you a check.

1584
02:29:58,718 --> 02:30:03,678
Who you gonna make it out to?
Kenny Klein doesn't exist.

1585
02:30:03,723 --> 02:30:06,954
He was sacrificed
for the movement.

1586
02:30:06,993 --> 02:30:10,190
I'm a cash and carry
enterprise now.

1587
02:30:18,338 --> 02:30:21,273
How long since you've
gotten any sleep?

1588
02:30:21,307 --> 02:30:23,468
Eye on the prize.
Remember, Sarah?

1589
02:30:23,509 --> 02:30:25,773
What? Extorting dope money
from old girlfriends?

1590
02:30:25,812 --> 02:30:28,610
That money is for the movement!

1591
02:30:31,851 --> 02:30:35,184
If the movement needs to score
a lid, the movement knows best.

1592
02:30:35,221 --> 02:30:36,688
Remember Blake...

1593
02:30:36,723 --> 02:30:40,386
"The tigers of wrath are wiser
than the horses of instruction."

1594
02:30:40,426 --> 02:30:42,087
Remember Ginsberg...

1595
02:30:42,128 --> 02:30:46,497
"I saw the best minds of my
generation destroyed by madness."

1596
02:30:49,702 --> 02:30:52,728
What happened to you, Kenny?

1597
02:30:57,944 --> 02:31:03,041
You weren't just my boyfriend,
you were my teacher.

1598
02:31:03,082 --> 02:31:05,346
I believed in you.

1599
02:31:06,986 --> 02:31:08,214
But now...

1600
02:31:11,457 --> 02:31:13,618
...you're a joke.

1601
02:31:14,794 --> 02:31:17,388
Michael was right.
You never cared about people...

1602
02:31:17,430 --> 02:31:20,831
you only cared about ideas,
now you don't have any ideas left.

1603
02:31:23,436 --> 02:31:25,404
Michael...

1604
02:31:32,111 --> 02:31:33,669
Hold it!

1605
02:31:35,581 --> 02:31:38,573
I don't know if
I can let you leave...

1606
02:31:38,618 --> 02:31:41,246
I'm afraid I'm gonna
have to kill ya.

1607
02:31:46,859 --> 02:31:50,056
I'm just goofin' ya.

1608
02:31:51,964 --> 02:31:55,058
Run away,
my little bourgeois princess!

1609
02:32:59,932 --> 02:33:01,695
It's me, Daddy.

1610
02:33:03,603 --> 02:33:06,572
I should have come before...

1611
02:33:06,606 --> 02:33:09,803
but I couldn't find my way.

1612
02:33:11,844 --> 02:33:14,813
I guess I was blinded by hate.

1613
02:33:19,418 --> 02:33:27,848
I want you to know,
I miss you...

1614
02:33:27,894 --> 02:33:32,024
and I hope you can see
all that I'm up to now.

1615
02:33:32,064 --> 02:33:35,556
I'm sure for the first time
you'd approve.

1616
02:33:45,311 --> 02:33:47,836
Pray for me, Daddy.

1617
02:33:58,891 --> 02:34:01,155
Who's hungry?

1618
02:34:13,472 --> 02:34:15,667
Does food taste better if
he serves it with a smile?

1619
02:34:15,708 --> 02:34:17,266
(shouting)
Yeah!

1620
02:34:17,310 --> 02:34:20,973
I said, does the food taste
better served with a smile?

1621
02:34:21,013 --> 02:34:23,106
Yes!

1622
02:34:25,184 --> 02:34:27,175
All right. We got oatmeal.

1623
02:34:34,460 --> 02:34:37,224
(Bill humming)

1624
02:34:41,267 --> 02:34:42,928
Hey!
You want a beer?

1625
02:34:48,774 --> 02:34:55,077
I was thinking about a verse
from the Marines hymn...

1626
02:34:55,114 --> 02:35:00,211
You know this one?
"If the Army and the Navy...

1627
02:35:00,253 --> 02:35:04,189
Ever gaze on Heaven's scenes...

1628
02:35:04,223 --> 02:35:07,556
They will find the
streets are guarded by...

1629
02:35:07,593 --> 02:35:10,357
the United States Marines."

1630
02:35:13,432 --> 02:35:16,230
God, I hate that song.

1631
02:35:20,406 --> 02:35:22,203
Dad, look at me...

1632
02:35:24,410 --> 02:35:26,469
That was another time...

1633
02:35:26,512 --> 02:35:29,003
I'm what war looks like now.

1634
02:35:29,048 --> 02:35:36,887
Brian, you risked your life
for another man's freedom...

1635
02:35:36,922 --> 02:35:39,982
that's a noble thing.

1636
02:35:42,261 --> 02:35:45,059
Dad, why the hell were we
there in the first place?

1637
02:35:47,466 --> 02:35:50,333
We didn't even know who
the enemy was.

1638
02:35:50,369 --> 02:35:55,671
So maybe you didn't like what
you saw when you got there,

1639
02:35:55,708 --> 02:35:59,872
but you don't get to pick and
choose your battles.

1640
02:36:01,013 --> 02:36:07,009
I'm proud that when your
country called, you went.

1641
02:36:07,053 --> 02:36:12,514
And I hope this war hasn't
destroyed the honor of that!

1642
02:36:15,661 --> 02:36:19,358
This is the wrong war
for your principles.

1643
02:36:20,232 --> 02:36:26,330
Son...
Principles are principles.

1644
02:36:29,241 --> 02:36:31,732
That's all a man has.

1645
02:36:39,018 --> 02:36:41,452
You've been asking
me questions all morning.

1646
02:36:41,487 --> 02:36:43,682
I've tried my best to answer...

1647
02:36:44,990 --> 02:36:47,151
but there are
some you haven't asked.

1648
02:36:48,527 --> 02:36:52,964
Why are we slaughtering men,
women, and children in Vietnam?

1649
02:36:54,033 --> 02:36:57,434
Why are we burning cities,
bombing villages,

1650
02:36:57,470 --> 02:36:59,904
and lying to the
American people about it?

1651
02:36:59,939 --> 02:37:04,000
Why have 40 thousand soldiers
given their lives?

1652
02:37:04,043 --> 02:37:07,171
I've tried to answer
these questions, and I can't.

1653
02:37:07,213 --> 02:37:11,411
Nobody else has, either.
Unless I can answer these questions...

1654
02:37:11,450 --> 02:37:15,250
I can't justify fighting
an illegal and immoral war!

1655
02:37:15,287 --> 02:37:18,814
I have to decide what I believe.

1656
02:37:18,858 --> 02:37:23,022
Peace is preferable to war.

1657
02:37:23,062 --> 02:37:25,360
Love is better than hate.

1658
02:37:27,099 --> 02:37:30,432
And I believe
this war is wrong.

1659
02:37:32,405 --> 02:37:34,635
Anything else?

1660
02:37:34,673 --> 02:37:35,640
Yes.

1661
02:37:37,309 --> 02:37:39,869
I'd like to say something
on my brother's behalf.

1662
02:37:39,912 --> 02:37:42,642
No need for that, Brian...

1663
02:37:56,595 --> 02:38:02,261
Some of you guys know me.
You know my son, Michael,

1664
02:38:02,301 --> 02:38:05,270
but I don't think you really
know him.

1665
02:38:09,074 --> 02:38:12,100
I barely know him myself.

1666
02:38:12,144 --> 02:38:18,310
When he was a kid,
he was good...

1667
02:38:18,350 --> 02:38:20,944
kind, and gentle.

1668
02:38:20,986 --> 02:38:24,922
He never believed hurting anyone
was the way to win.

1669
02:38:24,957 --> 02:38:29,087
I thought he might
become a priest.

1670
02:38:29,128 --> 02:38:37,194
I don't know what a
conscientious objector means...

1671
02:38:37,236 --> 02:38:43,539
but I do know what a conscience is,
and my son has one.

1672
02:38:43,576 --> 02:38:47,569
If his conscience
tells him he cannot fight...

1673
02:38:47,613 --> 02:38:51,014
it's not because he's
not brave enough to fight...

1674
02:38:51,050 --> 02:38:56,352
but because he's brave enough
to stand up for what he believes in.

1675
02:38:57,857 --> 02:39:03,090
That's how I raised my kids,
that's how you raised yours.

1676
02:39:04,096 --> 02:39:09,591
And I hope you're as proud
of them as I am of my son.

1677
02:39:09,635 --> 02:39:11,000
Michael.

1678
02:39:26,952 --> 02:39:29,147
Dad.

1679
02:39:41,500 --> 02:39:43,365
Now you're talkin'.

1680
02:39:43,402 --> 02:39:47,634
- How's my boy today?
- So far, today's a good day.

1681
02:39:57,016 --> 02:39:58,483
Here you go.

1682
02:40:03,222 --> 02:40:04,951
Katie...?

1683
02:40:15,000 --> 02:40:20,131
- Peace.
- It's not that easy, Dad.

1684
02:40:23,475 --> 02:40:27,707
- What can I say, Katie?
- What can you say?

1685
02:40:27,746 --> 02:40:29,805
That you're sorry you
sent me off to have a baby

1686
02:40:29,848 --> 02:40:32,578
when I was just a baby myself.

1687
02:40:34,253 --> 02:40:37,154
That you understand that you
made me feel completely worthless

1688
02:40:37,189 --> 02:40:39,555
when I needed you more
than anything?

1689
02:40:41,794 --> 02:40:44,991
There are a lotta things you can say.
But you have to say them.

1690
02:40:58,677 --> 02:41:01,771
I'm... l'm sorry, Katie.

1691
02:41:10,522 --> 02:41:16,154
- Are you still my baby?
- No, Dad. I grew up.

1692
02:41:17,496 --> 02:41:19,930
But I'm still your daughter.

1693
02:41:40,686 --> 02:41:42,313
Hello? Hello?

1694
02:41:42,354 --> 02:41:45,448
Knock - knock?

1695
02:41:45,491 --> 02:41:48,517
Who's there?

1696
02:41:50,929 --> 02:41:54,592
- Buddy, wow!
- Katie, gosh, you look so good!

1697
02:41:54,633 --> 02:41:56,965
- Thanks, you look good, too.
- Thanks.

1698
02:41:57,002 --> 02:41:59,095
Mr. H, what happened
to the Cubbies?

1699
02:41:59,138 --> 02:42:02,403
- Don't mention that.
- Hey, think fast.

1700
02:42:02,975 --> 02:42:04,670
Still got the hands.

1701
02:42:06,245 --> 02:42:09,009
Set! - Hike!

1702
02:42:18,157 --> 02:42:22,389
- It's good to see you.
- Good seein' you, Brian.

1703
02:42:22,428 --> 02:42:25,056
- Grab this guy a beer!
- Hey, Buddy...

1704
02:42:25,097 --> 02:42:27,088
- Hey, Mike, how are you?
- All right.

1705
02:42:42,414 --> 02:42:43,938
Hey.

1706
02:42:58,030 --> 02:42:59,998
What is it?

1707
02:43:00,032 --> 02:43:02,796
It's a side of lox.

1708
02:43:03,936 --> 02:43:06,496
It's that seafood thing again.

1709
02:43:08,941 --> 02:43:11,842
So much for the ice breaking.

1710
02:43:17,850 --> 02:43:22,480
You could make this
just a little easier.

1711
02:43:24,189 --> 02:43:26,282
I don't wanna be too easy.

1712
02:43:31,997 --> 02:43:34,227
What do you want?

1713
02:43:37,736 --> 02:43:40,000
I want you.

1714
02:43:45,177 --> 02:43:47,168
What do you want?

1715
02:44:00,125 --> 02:44:02,286
Mike, what happened to
those beers...?

1716
02:44:05,964 --> 02:44:09,229
This must be Sarah.
Hey everybody, you've gotta meet

1717
02:44:09,268 --> 02:44:13,329
the love of Michael's life,
Sarah Weinstock.

1718
02:44:14,473 --> 02:44:19,001
Weinstock? What is that?
Is that an Irish name?

1719
02:44:20,045 --> 02:44:23,446
Hey, Weinstock...
Go long.

1720
02:44:26,585 --> 02:44:27,984
Here you go...

1721
02:44:29,822 --> 02:44:31,687
All right! Nice catch.

1722
02:44:33,859 --> 02:44:36,020
Nice girl.

1723
02:44:36,061 --> 02:44:37,926
Good tight end.

1724
02:44:37,963 --> 02:44:41,330
All right everybody,
Weinstock's on my team. Let's go!
