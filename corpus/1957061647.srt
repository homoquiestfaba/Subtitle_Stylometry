00:00:58,732 --> 00:01:00,500
[soldier] Over here!

00:01:00,633 --> 00:01:03,167
[man on radio]
<i>Paxton, we need you in here.</i>

7
00:01:03,301 --> 00:01:04,866
On my way, sir.

8
00:01:11,201 --> 00:01:12,832
[soldier]
Morning, sir!

9
00:01:13,832 --> 00:01:15,866
[soldier 2] Come on,
let's help load up.

10
00:01:16,966 --> 00:01:18,400
[Paxton] Yo.

11
00:01:23,533 --> 00:01:24,966
[soldier]
Keep practicing.

12
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:27,134
[soldier 2]
There it is. Thanks, man.

13
00:01:28,567 --> 00:01:30,033
[Paxton]
Commander, sir!

14
00:01:30,633 --> 00:01:32,066
[commander] Captain.

15
00:01:34,533 --> 00:01:37,334
- You sure?
- It's coming from the top.

16
00:01:37,466 --> 00:01:40,033
Somebody's pet project
in Washington.

17
00:01:42,567 --> 00:01:46,301
They negotiated passage with ISIS.
They won't be in your way.

18
00:01:46,433 --> 00:01:49,567
This medical equipment
needs to get there soon.

19
00:01:49,699 --> 00:01:52,267
Children are dying
as we speak.

20
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,899
Copy that, sir.

21
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:58,334
- Be safe.
- I'll try.

22
00:01:58,466 --> 00:02:01,267
Let's rally up, guys.
We're headin' out.

23
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,667
[man] <i>Yes, sir.</i>

24
00:02:03,633 --> 00:02:06,933
- Pinto, could you grab my vest?
- [Pinto] <i>Copy.</i>

[helicopter blades whirring]

26
00:02:23,034 --> 00:02:25,267
- Here you go, sir.
- Good lookin' out.

27
00:02:27,533 --> 00:02:29,500
- Hey, Younes!
- Brother.

28
00:02:30,167 --> 00:02:31,999
- Good to see you.
- Same here.

29
00:02:32,134 --> 00:02:33,832
Good to have you
with us.

30
00:02:33,966 --> 00:02:35,600
- How have you been?
- Good.

31
00:02:35,732 --> 00:02:38,301
It's choppy waters
we're navigating today.

32
00:02:39,699 --> 00:02:41,933
- No easy dame.
- No.

33
00:02:42,067 --> 00:02:44,899
- Stay crispy, my friend, on the road.
- Stay safe.

34
00:02:46,933 --> 00:02:49,366
[wind whistling]

35
00:02:51,466 --> 00:02:54,466
Let's go, ladies!
Time to make the donuts!

36
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,067
Chop chop!

37
00:05:56,591 --> 00:05:57,857
[explosion]

38
00:05:57,992 --> 00:06:00,525

We need backup here!

00:06:07,692 --> 00:06:10,558
[soldiers shouting]

41
00:06:11,591 --> 00:06:13,891
[grunts] Cover me!

42
00:06:19,092 --> 00:06:20,258
Are you all right?

43
00:06:20,391 --> 00:06:21,857
We're gonna
get you out of here.

44
00:06:21,992 --> 00:06:24,425
Okay? We're gonna
get you out of here.

45
00:06:24,558 --> 00:06:26,458
You ready? Let's go!

46
00:06:28,891 --> 00:06:31,792
[high-pitched whine]

47
00:06:31,924 --> 00:06:33,924
[cries out]

48
00:06:37,857 --> 00:06:39,224
Baby?

49
00:06:39,725 --> 00:06:41,525
Brad. Hey.

50
00:06:43,558 --> 00:06:45,458
Brad, it's Kate.
You're home, okay?

51
00:06:45,591 --> 00:06:47,025
[gasps]

52
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:50,525
- Hey.
- [gasps, grunts]

00:06:52,125 --> 00:06:54,224
- Hey.

55
00:07:01,192 --> 00:07:03,958

- Brad. Brad.

58
00:07:46,858 --> 00:07:48,992
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:07:50,525 --> 00:07:51,925
[kisses]

60
00:07:52,925 --> 00:07:54,558
[sighs deeply]

61
00:07:54,692 --> 00:07:56,391
- Coffee?
- Mm.

62
00:07:57,191 --> 00:07:59,325
- Thank you.
- Yes.

63
00:08:00,792 --> 00:08:02,958
[sighs, grunts]

64
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:14,958
You wanna talk about it?

65
00:08:22,758 --> 00:08:24,458
- [Kate] Hey, kiddo.
- Good morning.

66
00:08:24,591 --> 00:08:26,692
- Hey, baby girl.
- [Kate] Good morning.

67
00:08:26,825 --> 00:08:28,591
I missed you.

68
00:08:28,725 --> 00:08:31,291
Missed you too, love bug.
[kiss]

69
00:08:31,425 --> 00:08:33,658
I made your favorite breakfast
this morning.

70
00:08:33,792 --> 00:08:35,358
Yes!

71
00:08:35,491 --> 00:08:36,558
Pancake.

72
00:08:36,692 --> 00:08:40,158
- Pancakes.
- [Brad] Pancake.

73
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:42,792
- [Kate] Oh!
- Get your own!

74
00:08:42,925 --> 00:08:46,258
- [all exclaim]
- Oh, my God, this is so good.

75
00:08:46,391 --> 00:08:48,525
Dad, are you taking me
to school today?

76
00:08:48,658 --> 00:08:51,325
Today and every day.

77
00:08:53,925 --> 00:08:55,391
Pancake?

78
00:08:56,625 --> 00:08:58,059
Please.

79
00:09:01,825 --> 00:09:03,291
[sighs]

80
00:09:16,059 --> 00:09:18,158
- [man] Yeah, yeah, what's up?
- What's up?

81
00:09:19,558 --> 00:09:21,458
[boxers grunting]

82
00:09:23,025 --> 00:09:25,958
- Give me two.
- [grunting]

83
00:09:26,091 --> 00:09:27,425
Give me three.

84
00:09:28,358 --> 00:09:30,458
- Ho!
- Not bad for an old man.

85
00:09:31,224 --> 00:09:32,491
- Hey, son.
- Hey.

86
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:35,025
Come here.
Let me kick your baby ass.

87
00:09:35,158 --> 00:09:36,558
What's up, champ?

88
00:09:37,525 --> 00:09:39,525
- I'm good.
- You look good, man.

89
00:09:40,925 --> 00:09:44,558
- Ooh. Let's do it.
- All right.

90
00:09:46,191 --> 00:09:47,958
Come on, son,
show me what you got.

91
00:09:48,091 --> 00:09:49,558
All right. Give me two.

92
00:09:51,224 --> 00:09:53,091
What's going on with you?

93
00:09:53,224 --> 00:09:55,291
- You're hitting like a little girl.
- [chuckles]

94
00:09:55,425 --> 00:09:57,558
I'm just warming up,
Pop, come on.

95
00:09:57,692 --> 00:10:00,091
Son, jab cross. Come on.

96
00:10:00,224 --> 00:10:03,358
There you go.
Listen, son, I'm your father.

97
00:10:03,491 --> 00:10:05,258
Yeah, someone
told me that.

98
00:10:05,391 --> 00:10:07,925
I also happen to know what I'm
talking about. Give me two.

99
00:10:08,058 --> 00:10:10,958
Look, those nightmares
you're having?

100
00:10:11,091 --> 00:10:12,892
They ain't going away,
all right?

101
00:10:13,024 --> 00:10:15,458
You need to do something
about them. All right?

102
00:10:15,591 --> 00:10:18,124
These things can
shut you down like that.

103
00:10:18,692 --> 00:10:21,191
Deeper than you know. Okay?

104
00:10:21,325 --> 00:10:24,925
And you need to let someone...
me, somebody... help you.

105
00:10:25,058 --> 00:10:26,625
Can you do that? Huh?

106
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:29,525
[sighs] Pop,
I... I'm fine, okay?

107
00:10:29,658 --> 00:10:31,091
All right,
give me two.

108
00:10:32,693 --> 00:10:34,124
Give me two. Come on!

109
00:10:34,258 --> 00:10:37,258
Okay, and anything
can trigger, all right?

110
00:10:37,391 --> 00:10:38,958
- I won't let it happen.
- All right.

111
00:10:39,091 --> 00:10:41,091
Give me two. Come on.

112
00:10:41,224 --> 00:10:43,591
There you go. All right.

113
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:45,391
And another thing, son...

114
00:10:45,525 --> 00:10:48,726
Hey, I'm not gonna come into
the ring and talk about my wife.

115
00:10:48,892 --> 00:10:50,458
Give me two. Oh!

116
00:10:50,591 --> 00:10:55,191
All right, look. Listen,
Kate, she's a great mother.

117
00:10:55,325 --> 00:10:57,759
- She's taken a lot on.
- Come on, Pop.

118
00:10:57,892 --> 00:11:00,358
And for her sake, trust me.

119
00:11:00,491 --> 00:11:03,825
- Yeah.
- Respect her love for you.

120
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:05,858
Can you do that?

121
00:11:05,991 --> 00:11:08,258
- Yeah.
- Okay. That's my boy.

122
00:11:08,391 --> 00:11:11,291
- Yes, sir.
- All right, show me what you got! What you got!

123
00:11:11,425 --> 00:11:14,659
Ho! Ho! That's my boy!
Give me two.

124
00:11:14,793 --> 00:11:16,024
Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho!

125
00:11:16,158 --> 00:11:18,091
- [grunting]
- Ho!

126
00:11:18,224 --> 00:11:20,291
What you got,
what you got, what you got?

127
00:11:20,425 --> 00:11:22,325
[both laughing]

128
00:11:24,925 --> 00:11:27,491
[Kate] <i>Okay. And...</i>

129
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:30,158
we saved the best for last.

130
00:11:30,291 --> 00:11:32,991
In Morocco, on the edge
of the Sahara desert,

131
00:11:33,124 --> 00:11:35,991
near what is now
the Algerian border,

132
00:11:36,124 --> 00:11:38,091
a team of archaeologists

133
00:11:38,224 --> 00:11:40,659
were exploring the depths
of an abandoned mine

134
00:11:40,793 --> 00:11:44,425
when they came across
something incredible.

135
00:11:45,158 --> 00:11:49,191
315,000-year-old human bones...

136
00:11:49,325 --> 00:11:53,858
- [crowd gasps]
- ...which shake the foundation of human history to its core.

137
00:11:53,991 --> 00:11:57,391
Because scientific research
has believed that human origins

138
00:11:57,525 --> 00:12:02,058
started 200,000 years ago,
and in eastern Africa.

139
00:12:02,191 --> 00:12:04,957
So it was believed
that humanity spread out

140
00:12:05,091 --> 00:12:06,659
and then populated the world.

141
00:12:06,793 --> 00:12:10,793
But this discovery in Morocco
is changing all of that.

142
00:12:10,924 --> 00:12:14,592
It's making us examine
our belief of where and when

143
00:12:14,726 --> 00:12:17,726
humans first walked on Earth.

144
00:12:17,858 --> 00:12:19,525
- [crowd murmuring]
- So...

145
00:12:19,659 --> 00:12:23,626
I contacted my friends at NASA,
and I asked for their help.

146
00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:26,458
And this is what we found.

147
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:29,458
[crowd exclaims]

148
00:12:30,425 --> 00:12:33,091
Ladies and gentlemen,
it is without a doubt

149
00:12:33,224 --> 00:12:36,191
that we have found
a large, ancient city

150
00:12:36,325 --> 00:12:39,659
of unknown origin
under the desert.

151
00:12:39,793 --> 00:12:41,258
Now, I've been working closely

152
00:12:41,391 --> 00:12:43,425
with the Moroccan
antiquity authorities,

153
00:12:43,558 --> 00:12:47,891
and I am proud to say that
myself and my team here

154
00:12:48,024 --> 00:12:51,325
have been granted access
to excavate.

155
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:53,224
[crowd applauding]

156
00:13:00,559 --> 00:13:02,224
[sighs]

157
00:13:08,891 --> 00:13:10,825
[exhales]

158
00:13:19,191 --> 00:13:21,526

160

- [soldier groaning]
- Hey. Stay with me!

161
00:13:29,793 --> 00:13:31,258
Stay with me, come on!

162
00:13:31,391 --> 00:13:32,857
Younes!

163
00:13:35,124 --> 00:13:37,924
Younes! Take him
and get back to the base.

164
00:13:38,058 --> 00:13:40,793
They don't want us, they just want
the meds and the doctors, all right?

165
00:13:40,924 --> 00:13:44,491
- I'm not leaving you here!
- Get back to the base and get me some backup!

166
00:13:48,592 --> 00:13:51,358
[reporter on TV] <i>The President awarded
the country's highest military honor...</i>

I didn't get myself back home...</i>

174
00:14:11,391 --> 00:14:13,526
Yeah. Yeah, just give me
one sec, okay?

175
00:14:13,659 --> 00:14:15,659
<i>...so I hung in there.</i>

176
00:14:15,792 --> 00:14:17,124
<i>Thankfully.</i>

177
00:14:17,258 --> 00:14:18,824
[Brad] It's good to see
you walking again, man.

178
00:14:18,957 --> 00:14:20,492
[man]
I'll always be grateful.

179
00:14:20,626 --> 00:14:22,492
You know, you saved my life.

180
00:14:22,626 --> 00:14:25,425
[Brad] Don't mention it.
You would've done the same for me.

181
00:14:25,559 --> 00:14:26,659
[knocking]

182
00:14:27,358 --> 00:14:29,792
Give me a minute
with my old lady.

183
00:14:29,924 --> 00:14:31,224
Thanks, man.

184
00:14:32,693 --> 00:14:35,058
- Hi, mama bear.
- Hiya.

185
00:14:35,792 --> 00:14:37,058
Hey.

186
00:14:39,991 --> 00:14:41,792
Who are all these people
in my house?

187
00:14:41,924 --> 00:14:43,526
[chuckles]

188
00:14:45,058 --> 00:14:47,358
They are all here for you.

189
00:14:49,891 --> 00:14:51,358
You okay?

190
00:14:55,824 --> 00:14:57,158
[grunts]

191
00:14:58,991 --> 00:15:01,024
I just, um...

192
00:15:03,091 --> 00:15:05,526
I don't know
if it's necessarily...

193
00:15:07,559 --> 00:15:11,492
the right time for me
to leave, you know?

194
00:15:13,758 --> 00:15:15,158
[sighs]

195
00:15:16,758 --> 00:15:18,459
I mean, I... I...

196
00:15:19,891 --> 00:15:21,957
I love my job.

197
00:15:23,224 --> 00:15:25,426
I just love you more.

198
00:15:28,891 --> 00:15:31,459
You gotta trust me here, okay?

199
00:15:33,924 --> 00:15:36,158
Okay, but you have
to promise me...

200
00:15:37,526 --> 00:15:39,158
that if you need me...

201
00:15:39,291 --> 00:15:42,091
at all, for any reason...
that you tell me.

202
00:15:42,224 --> 00:15:44,692
Because I will
drop everything,

203
00:15:44,824 --> 00:15:46,957
and I will come home.

204
00:15:49,392 --> 00:15:52,291
I promise.
Don't worry, okay?

205
00:15:54,426 --> 00:15:57,559
And besides, I'm not gonna
let you drop this

206
00:15:57,692 --> 00:15:59,991
so you can, what,
give the credit to someone else?

207
00:16:00,124 --> 00:16:02,725
- [laughs]
- Come on.

208
00:16:02,857 --> 00:16:05,258
This is gonna be great,
right?

209
00:16:05,392 --> 00:16:06,991
[exhales]

210
00:16:07,124 --> 00:16:09,957
Yeah. Yeah,
it's gonna be good.

211
00:16:10,091 --> 00:16:12,024
Yes! Of course!

212
00:16:12,158 --> 00:16:15,626
And Morocco's beautiful.
You're gonna love it.

213
00:16:15,758 --> 00:16:18,492
I know. I've always been so
close, but I never got to go.

214
00:16:18,626 --> 00:16:21,426
Oh. You're gonna have
such a good time.

215
00:16:21,559 --> 00:16:24,024
And look, Clair-bear and I,

216
00:16:24,158 --> 00:16:27,325
we really need some
daddy-daughter time, you know?

217
00:16:27,692 --> 00:16:28,924
Yeah.

218
00:16:33,592 --> 00:16:36,824
- Get these people out of my house.
- [laughs]

219
00:17:32,725 --> 00:17:35,459
[football playing on TV]

220
00:17:35,591 --> 00:17:38,758
[Brad] The worst game
I've ever seen in my life.

221
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:43,292
[announcer]
<i>He's in for the score. Oh...</i>

222
00:17:43,426 --> 00:17:44,692
Oh, come on!

223
00:17:44,824 --> 00:17:48,359
What a bad play, man.

224
00:17:48,492 --> 00:17:51,091
[cell phone buzzing]

225
00:17:51,224 --> 00:17:54,292
Your mom's calling.
[turns off TV]

226
00:17:54,426 --> 00:17:55,924
Hey, babe.

227
00:17:56,058 --> 00:17:58,326
- How's the trip going?
- <i>Good, I, uh...</i>

228
00:17:58,459 --> 00:18:01,024
I'm just getting
everything unpacked now.

229
00:18:01,158 --> 00:18:03,292
But you're right, it's...

230
00:18:03,426 --> 00:18:06,392
- it's so beautiful here, it's insane.
- <i>I told you.</i>

231
00:18:07,326 --> 00:18:09,857
- Hey, Mom.
- Hi, Kate!

232
00:18:09,991 --> 00:18:12,224
Hey, kiddo! Hey, Ed.

233
00:18:12,359 --> 00:18:14,124
How are you guys?
What are you guys doin'?

234
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:16,957
We're building an ancient
site with Grandpa.

235
00:18:17,091 --> 00:18:19,091
- That sounds amazing.
- <i>You okay?</i>

236
00:18:19,225 --> 00:18:21,124
What's it like over there?

237
00:18:22,191 --> 00:18:24,525
It's beautiful. It is...

238
00:18:24,658 --> 00:18:26,991
It's something I've never seen before.
It's just...

239
00:18:27,124 --> 00:18:29,492
Okay, Mom, gotta go.
Bye. Love you.

240
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:32,392
[laughs]
Oh, she's busy.

241
00:18:32,525 --> 00:18:34,792
She's only 11, and she doesn't
even care about me anymore.

242
00:18:34,924 --> 00:18:36,957
That's not true.
She misses you.

243
00:18:37,091 --> 00:18:38,591
We all miss you.

244
00:18:39,124 --> 00:18:40,824
I miss you too.

245
00:18:40,957 --> 00:18:43,158
<i>Are you okay?</i>

246
00:18:43,891 --> 00:18:45,292
I'm good.

247
00:18:48,292 --> 00:18:50,824
I'll call you before
I go to bed, okay?

248
00:18:50,957 --> 00:18:53,091
- <i>Okay, do that.</i>
- I love you.

249
00:18:53,225 --> 00:18:55,091
<i>Love you more.</i>

250

253
00:19:25,658 --> 00:19:26,758
Miss Paxton.

254
00:19:28,124 --> 00:19:31,124
I'm Jean Rashidi.
It's such a pleasure to finally meet you.

255
00:19:31,259 --> 00:19:33,491
The pleasure is all mine,
Mr. Rashidi.

256
00:19:34,292 --> 00:19:37,058
- Please. Call me Jean.
- Jean. I mean...

257
00:19:37,192 --> 00:19:40,658
What a find. This is incredible.
Congratulations.

258
00:19:40,792 --> 00:19:42,225
Thank you.
My colleagues and I

259
00:19:42,359 --> 00:19:44,658
haven't had this much
excitement in years.

260
00:19:44,792 --> 00:19:46,857
We are honored
to be part of this.

261
00:19:46,991 --> 00:19:50,192
I mean, the feeling is mutual.
I can't wait to get out there.

262
00:19:50,326 --> 00:19:52,792
- Jean. Mrs. Paxton.
- Mr. Achour.

263
00:19:52,924 --> 00:19:55,159
Thank you so much
for the hospitality.

264
00:19:55,292 --> 00:19:56,991
- This is incredible.
- It's a pleasure.

265
00:19:57,124 --> 00:19:59,857
Let me introduce you to
your Moroccan counterpart.

266
00:19:59,991 --> 00:20:03,091
This is Amir Jadid.
He will be your scout leader.

267
00:20:03,225 --> 00:20:05,458
Anything you need,
anywhere you want to go.

268
00:20:05,591 --> 00:20:07,125
Oh. Thank you.

269
00:20:07,259 --> 00:20:10,192
I'm of course at your disposal.
Just a phone call away.

270
00:20:13,692 --> 00:20:16,192
[chattering in French]

271
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:21,125
- [man] Mrs. Paxton?
- Yeah.

272
00:20:21,259 --> 00:20:24,392
- Hakim Zaydane. Chief of Police.
- Nice to meet you, Chief.

273
00:20:24,525 --> 00:20:27,159
Have we, uh, done
something wrong already?

274
00:20:27,292 --> 00:20:29,091
No, no, of course not. No.

275
00:20:29,225 --> 00:20:32,792
I'm here on behalf of my
superior, Mr. Younes Laalej.

276
00:20:32,924 --> 00:20:34,292
Is he our
government liaison?

277
00:20:34,425 --> 00:20:36,591
No, no, but you're gonna
be meeting her shortly.

278
00:20:38,259 --> 00:20:40,758
Mr. Laalej has been serving
with your husband,

279
00:20:40,891 --> 00:20:43,824
and he asked me to watch over
you during the coming week.

280
00:20:43,957 --> 00:20:48,159
So please don't hesitate to call
me at any time, day or night.

281
00:20:48,292 --> 00:20:50,824
- Thank Mr. Laalej in Rabat for me.
- I will.

282
00:20:50,957 --> 00:20:53,391
- Good luck, madam.
- Thank you.

283
00:20:53,525 --> 00:20:56,359
[in Arabic]

284
00:21:08,692 --> 00:21:10,591
- Mrs. Paxton?
- Yeah.

285
00:21:10,725 --> 00:21:12,891
Hi. My name is
Dina Mansouri.

286
00:21:13,024 --> 00:21:14,891
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

287
00:21:15,024 --> 00:21:16,758
- Shall we go?
- Yeah.

288
00:21:16,891 --> 00:21:18,425
[whistles]

289

[indistinct chattering]

291
00:22:28,625 --> 00:22:30,792
The ancient city
should be around here.

292
00:22:32,092 --> 00:22:35,758
Okay. All right. Well, obviously,
safety is our first priority,

293
00:22:35,891 --> 00:22:37,225
but let's get
as close as we can

294
00:22:37,358 --> 00:22:39,225
so we can establish
our parameters

295
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:41,558
and compare them
against the sat imagery.

296
00:22:42,591 --> 00:22:43,992
Okay. Follow me, guys.

297
00:23:13,824 --> 00:23:17,658
[Dina] We are very close to the border.
We have to be careful.

298
00:23:17,792 --> 00:23:20,258
Okay. Just let me know.

299
00:23:37,491 --> 00:23:39,958
[Dina] This is as close
as we can get.

300
00:23:41,992 --> 00:23:43,591
I think we should go back.

301
00:23:45,125 --> 00:23:47,391
Kate, I agree. I think
we should start the dig

302
00:23:47,525 --> 00:23:50,558
on the other side of the city
wall and work our way here.

303
00:23:50,692 --> 00:23:53,857
It might take years
before we get here, anyway.

Hey. What's going on?

- Don't move! Hands up!
- Please don't shoot! Please!

322
00:24:51,892 --> 00:24:53,692
- Hands up!
- Please! Don't!

323
00:24:53,824 --> 00:24:55,958
Don't shoot! Please.

324
00:24:56,092 --> 00:24:58,825

Please don't shoot.

the border, okay?

328

[soldier 2] Fuck!

333
00:27:05,224 --> 00:27:07,425
We need backup.
We're getting hammered here.

Brad... I'm afraid
I have some bad news.

341
00:27:45,957 --> 00:27:47,258
Kate.

342
00:27:49,058 --> 00:27:51,358
- She has been abducted.
- <i>What?</i>

343
00:27:51,491 --> 00:27:53,458
- <i>Just an hour ago.</i>
- Where?

345
00:27:54,991 --> 00:27:56,625
She's in Algeria.

346
00:27:56,759 --> 00:27:59,525
Younes, how the fuck could this
have happened in less than 24 hours?

347
00:27:59,659 --> 00:28:00,991
<i>We had all eyes on them.</i>

348
00:28:01,124 --> 00:28:03,726
One of my men was even killed
trying to rescue her,

349
00:28:03,892 --> 00:28:05,458
as well as her
government liaison.

350
00:28:05,591 --> 00:28:08,358
<i>Kate was seen taken alive
with two others.</i>

351
00:28:09,793 --> 00:28:11,591
I'm on the first flight out.

352
00:28:42,858 --> 00:28:44,759
Hey, Dad.

353
00:28:44,892 --> 00:28:46,291
Hey, baby girl.

354
00:28:46,425 --> 00:28:48,591
Are you going
to work again?

355
00:28:49,759 --> 00:28:51,291
Yes.

356
00:28:51,425 --> 00:28:53,091
Okay.

357
00:28:53,224 --> 00:28:56,058
But Pop Pop will
be here shortly, okay?

358
00:28:56,191 --> 00:28:58,191
He'll take care
of everything.

359
00:29:03,793 --> 00:29:05,425
I'll be back soon.

360
00:29:48,693 --> 00:29:50,325
[in Arabic]

361
00:30:21,024 --> 00:30:22,358
[man speaks Arabic]

362
00:30:32,158 --> 00:30:33,891
[man shouts in Arabic]

363
00:30:36,759 --> 00:30:38,559
[man speaks Arabic]

364
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:04,291
Welcome to Algeria.
What are you doing here?

365
00:31:06,091 --> 00:31:07,857
We didn't mean
to cross the border.

366
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:09,726
I am on a dig
that is sanctioned

367
00:31:09,857 --> 00:31:11,857
by the Moroccan government. I...

368
00:31:11,991 --> 00:31:13,592
[man] You are spy!

369
00:31:13,726 --> 00:31:15,492
No. No, I am not a spy.

370
00:31:15,626 --> 00:31:17,891
I... I am an archaeologist.

371
00:31:21,058 --> 00:31:22,492
[cocks weapon]

372
00:31:24,058 --> 00:31:25,425
[in Arabic]

373
00:31:35,492 --> 00:31:37,024
What's your name?

374
00:31:38,224 --> 00:31:40,291
My name is Kate Paxton.

375
00:31:40,426 --> 00:31:42,124
Kate Paxton.

376
00:31:43,659 --> 00:31:46,325
- And you?
- Amir.

377
00:31:46,459 --> 00:31:47,526
Speak up!

378
00:31:48,058 --> 00:31:50,626
Amir Jadid.

379
00:31:50,758 --> 00:31:52,158
[interrogator] Moroccan?

380
00:31:53,291 --> 00:31:54,857
[Amir in French] Yes.

381
00:32:01,358 --> 00:32:02,559
And you.

382
00:32:04,091 --> 00:32:05,391
Jean Rashidi, sir.

383
00:32:05,526 --> 00:32:07,559
[laughing]

384
00:32:09,991 --> 00:32:12,758
[in Arabic]

385
00:32:12,891 --> 00:32:15,991
[in French]

386
00:32:20,792 --> 00:32:24,058
[in French]

387
00:32:54,091 --> 00:32:56,526
[jet engines roar]

388
00:33:10,725 --> 00:33:12,957
[chattering]

389
00:33:15,559 --> 00:33:16,824
- Paxton, brother.
- Younes.

390
00:33:16,957 --> 00:33:18,359
Tell me something
about these guys.

391
00:33:18,492 --> 00:33:20,124
These people are
some fringe group,

392
00:33:20,258 --> 00:33:22,058
just recently pledged
allegiance to ISIS.

393
00:33:22,191 --> 00:33:24,024
We know very little
about them.

394
00:33:24,891 --> 00:33:26,191
The Moroccan government liaison

395
00:33:26,326 --> 00:33:28,326
must have missed
the borderline with Algeria.

396
00:33:28,459 --> 00:33:30,426
It can easily happen
when you walk this river.

397
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:33,725
Then they show up out of nowhere the
minute Kate and her team crossed.

398
00:33:33,857 --> 00:33:36,291
- Security breach.
- Most likely, yes.

399
00:33:36,957 --> 00:33:39,224
- Any leads?
- The driver.

400
00:33:39,359 --> 00:33:42,526
He was driving Kate's vehicle.
He's nowhere to be found.

401
00:33:47,058 --> 00:33:49,359
[engine starts]

402
00:34:02,792 --> 00:34:04,924
[key rattling in lock]

403
00:34:06,091 --> 00:34:07,258
[in Arabic] Get in.

404
00:34:10,426 --> 00:34:11,891
Put it there.

405
00:34:17,924 --> 00:34:20,224
[coughing, gagging]

406
00:34:27,492 --> 00:34:29,158
[man in English]
What's wrong with you?

407
00:34:29,292 --> 00:34:31,492
- [retching]
- Are you pregnant?

408
00:34:31,625 --> 00:34:33,392
[retches, coughs]

409
00:34:33,526 --> 00:34:34,692
Answer my question!

410
00:34:34,824 --> 00:34:38,359
[grunts] No. No, I'm not.

411
00:34:39,625 --> 00:34:40,891
[panting]

412
00:34:41,758 --> 00:34:43,957
[in Arabic]

413
00:35:02,924 --> 00:35:04,292
[in English]
Eat your food.

414
00:35:04,957 --> 00:35:06,658
- I'll watch you.
- Hey.

415
00:35:06,792 --> 00:35:08,359
Hey, you speak English?

416
00:35:09,024 --> 00:35:10,924
I learned from
American movies.

417
00:35:11,058 --> 00:35:12,857
What's your, uh...

418
00:35:13,891 --> 00:35:15,891
What's your favorite
movie star?

419
00:35:17,525 --> 00:35:19,124
Jackie Chan.

420
00:35:19,259 --> 00:35:22,891
[laughs] That's a good choice.
He's mine, too.

421
00:35:24,426 --> 00:35:27,924
- What's your name?
- Uh, my name is Omar.

422
00:35:28,824 --> 00:35:30,658
Omar, I'm Kate.

423
00:35:30,792 --> 00:35:32,459
It's really nice to meet you.

424
00:35:38,758 --> 00:35:40,392
Do you know where
my friends are?

425
00:35:43,792 --> 00:35:45,192
In other rooms.

426
00:35:47,024 --> 00:35:48,426
Are they okay?

427
00:35:49,591 --> 00:35:52,124
Yes. For now.

428
00:35:53,725 --> 00:35:55,124
[softly] Okay.

429
00:35:58,024 --> 00:36:00,392
[retches, coughs]

430
00:36:00,525 --> 00:36:01,891
Be quiet.

431
00:36:02,024 --> 00:36:03,957
Hey, be quiet.

432
00:36:04,091 --> 00:36:06,058
Don't bring attention
to you.

433
00:36:06,192 --> 00:36:09,359
Okay? I'm gonna
bring you some water.

434
00:36:12,792 --> 00:36:14,792
[locks door]

435
00:36:14,924 --> 00:36:17,326
[birds chirping]

436
00:36:21,392 --> 00:36:24,692
<i>The age-old Sahara conflict
between Morocco and Algeria</i>

437
00:36:24,824 --> 00:36:27,192
<i>is front and center,
especially now,</i>

438
00:36:27,326 --> 00:36:30,491
<i>with a crucial vote in the UN
scheduled for next week.</i>

439
00:36:30,625 --> 00:36:33,558
<i>What do we know about the vote
and this conflict?</i>

440
00:36:33,692 --> 00:36:35,991
<i>For most of us, it's the first
we've heard of it.</i>

441
00:36:36,124 --> 00:36:38,692
- [phone rings]
- Yes?

442
00:36:38,824 --> 00:36:41,525
[woman] <i>Mr. Tom Fitzgerald
is here to see you, sir.</i>

443
00:36:41,658 --> 00:36:44,824
Send him in.
[turns off TV]

444
00:36:45,924 --> 00:36:47,225
Come in, Fitzy.

445
00:36:50,159 --> 00:36:51,425
It's good to see you.

446
00:36:51,558 --> 00:36:52,725
Good to see you.

447
00:36:52,857 --> 00:36:54,824
Smells good in here.
Cubans?

448
00:36:54,957 --> 00:36:57,024
- State secret, really.
- Uh-huh.

449
00:36:58,824 --> 00:37:01,625
Fitzy...
that UN vote next week,

450
00:37:01,758 --> 00:37:05,192
if it favors Morocco,
the American and British oil companies

451
00:37:05,326 --> 00:37:07,758
will be able to keep
drilling in Moroccan Sahara.

452
00:37:07,891 --> 00:37:09,359
And considering
what just happened

453
00:37:09,491 --> 00:37:12,326
and the fact that it happened
in Algerian territory,

454
00:37:12,458 --> 00:37:14,725
the majority of the vote
is gonna favor Morocco,

455
00:37:14,857 --> 00:37:17,292
which in effect
will create a...

456
00:37:17,425 --> 00:37:20,292
what you might call
an epic win for Big Oil.

457
00:37:21,225 --> 00:37:23,359
Quite the coincidence?

458
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:25,891
Hmm. Indeed.

459
00:37:26,024 --> 00:37:30,058
So, they're here.
We should discuss our approach?

460
00:37:32,425 --> 00:37:33,824
Our approach.

461
00:37:34,957 --> 00:37:37,259
- Would you like a drink?
- No, thank you.

462
00:37:37,792 --> 00:37:39,125
More for me.

463
00:37:40,092 --> 00:37:43,725
You know, when my wife
and I transferred here,

464
00:37:43,857 --> 00:37:45,458
we were very excited...

465
00:37:45,591 --> 00:37:47,391
[pouring]

466
00:37:48,225 --> 00:37:50,192
...once we left Pakistan.

467
00:37:51,225 --> 00:37:53,891
We were looking for a quieter,
more peaceful place

468
00:37:54,024 --> 00:37:56,458
and perhaps some weekends
in Marrakech.

469
00:37:56,591 --> 00:37:58,192
And instead...

470
00:37:58,326 --> 00:38:00,758
we got a different part
of the same jungle.

471
00:38:00,891 --> 00:38:02,192
Cheers.

472
00:38:02,957 --> 00:38:04,857
So, Captain Paxton.

473
00:38:06,591 --> 00:38:07,924
He's very concerned.

474
00:38:08,059 --> 00:38:09,824
He also works for
Globe Security Group.

475
00:38:09,957 --> 00:38:12,059
- He's a hostage negotiator.
- One of the best.

476
00:38:12,192 --> 00:38:16,159
He was responsible for the release
of those students in Nigeria,

477
00:38:16,292 --> 00:38:18,425
and that was no small feat.

478
00:38:19,292 --> 00:38:21,092
We can't have him involved
in this, Earl.

479
00:38:21,225 --> 00:38:24,125
Under no circumstances.

480
00:38:29,358 --> 00:38:31,857
I've read
the rule book, Fitzy.

481
00:38:33,625 --> 00:38:37,758
Nevertheless, I'm excited
to meet him, so...

482
00:38:37,891 --> 00:38:40,758
I suggest...
I just won't let him in.

483
00:38:40,891 --> 00:38:42,159
Hmm?

484
00:38:42,991 --> 00:38:44,425
Of course.

485
00:38:46,059 --> 00:38:47,558
- Elizabeth.
- <i>Sir?</i>

486
00:38:47,692 --> 00:38:50,391
Show, uh, Captain Paxton
and the others in, please.

487
00:38:50,525 --> 00:38:51,857
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

488
00:38:56,325 --> 00:38:57,824
- Chief Sekkat.
- Ambassador.

489
00:38:57,957 --> 00:39:01,125
Ah, Captain Paxton.
What an honor it is to meet you, sir.

490
00:39:01,259 --> 00:39:02,957
Honor is mine, Ambassador.

491
00:39:03,092 --> 00:39:05,792
I'm truly sorry that it's under
these terrible circumstances.

492
00:39:05,924 --> 00:39:07,192
Thank you, sir.

493
00:39:07,325 --> 00:39:09,192
- Younes.
- Ambassador.

494
00:39:09,325 --> 00:39:12,225
Honor to meet you, Captain.
Tom Fitzgerald.

495
00:39:12,358 --> 00:39:14,391
- Section chief.
- Honor, sir.

496
00:39:14,525 --> 00:39:15,558
- Younes.
- Fitz.

497
00:39:17,025 --> 00:39:19,792
Our government has allowed
Captain Paxton to join in.

498
00:39:19,924 --> 00:39:22,225
He will be included
in all our joint meetings.

499
00:39:22,358 --> 00:39:24,591
Sorry, Captain and Younes,

500
00:39:24,725 --> 00:39:27,391
but, uh, there's
a matter of clearance.

501
00:39:27,525 --> 00:39:29,092
I'll have to speak
to Washington.

502
00:39:29,225 --> 00:39:32,025
Captain Paxton has been granted
clearance on our side.

503
00:39:35,824 --> 00:39:37,425
Uh, Chief. Ma'am.

504
00:39:37,558 --> 00:39:40,924
You know that US government
policy does not allow

505
00:39:41,059 --> 00:39:42,725
relatives or friends
to participate...

506
00:39:42,857 --> 00:39:44,458
Mr. Fitzgerald.

507
00:39:44,591 --> 00:39:47,125
We expect full cooperation
between our governments.

508
00:39:48,192 --> 00:39:51,258
Captain Paxton is now
a part of our task force.

509
00:39:51,391 --> 00:39:52,857
Let's get
this briefing going.

510
00:39:52,992 --> 00:39:55,325
I agree.
Please, have a seat.

511
00:40:03,958 --> 00:40:06,192
Well, we know
that the hostages

512
00:40:06,325 --> 00:40:08,125
are in Algeria,
we just don't know where.

513
00:40:08,258 --> 00:40:09,958
We also know
that the Algerians

514
00:40:10,092 --> 00:40:12,925
are as pissed off
about this as we are,

515
00:40:13,059 --> 00:40:15,059
and I see as a first step

516
00:40:15,192 --> 00:40:18,192
that we give 'em the time
to get intel on the ground.

517
00:40:18,325 --> 00:40:20,824
We all agree negotiation
is out of the question.

518
00:40:20,958 --> 00:40:24,325
The leader's name
is Jaafar El Hadi.

519
00:40:24,458 --> 00:40:27,958
He's been on Interpol's radar
for a couple of years now.

520
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:30,358
Fitz, brief us.
What do we know about him?

521
00:40:30,491 --> 00:40:34,558
[sighs] Well, El Hadi is French,
of Algerian origins,

522
00:40:34,692 --> 00:40:38,325
he's a wealthy businessman.
He likes money.

523
00:40:38,458 --> 00:40:40,758
He likes his picture
in the paper.

524
00:40:41,558 --> 00:40:44,059
He was radicalized
two years ago,

bankrolled two attacks
in Paris.

526
00:40:47,658 --> 00:40:50,258
He has the means to have
a self-sufficient operation,

527
00:40:50,391 --> 00:40:52,925
gather followers
and buy weapons.

528
00:40:53,725 --> 00:40:55,458
We think he's ISIS-inspired.

529
00:40:56,025 --> 00:40:57,992
He wants their attention.

530
00:40:58,992 --> 00:41:00,792
Captain, thoughts?

531
00:41:00,925 --> 00:41:02,658
It's been 24 hours.

532
00:41:02,792 --> 00:41:06,025
We have not heard from El Hadi.
That is alarming.

533
00:41:07,191 --> 00:41:09,325
We need intel
on the ground now, sir,

534
00:41:09,458 --> 00:41:11,191
and not just
from the Algerians.

535
00:41:11,325 --> 00:41:13,525
Once we find him,
we can extract them.

536
00:41:14,758 --> 00:41:16,792
- A rescue mission.
- Yes, sir.

537
00:41:16,925 --> 00:41:20,391
They were taken to be beheaded.
They'll be dead within days.

538
00:41:21,391 --> 00:41:23,358
Well, the Algerians
are looking,

539
00:41:23,491 --> 00:41:26,291
and they're trying to gather
the intel that we need,

540
00:41:26,425 --> 00:41:30,258
because right now, I must
confess, we're operating blind.

541
00:41:31,224 --> 00:41:35,291
With all due respect,
Mr. Ambassador, sir...

542
00:41:35,425 --> 00:41:40,391
besides the Algerians, we have intel
superpowers right here at this table.

543
00:41:41,591 --> 00:41:43,425
We should be able
to find them.

544
00:41:43,558 --> 00:41:45,391
We should.

545
00:41:45,525 --> 00:41:46,958
Yes, sir.

546
00:41:48,191 --> 00:41:49,591
Okay, let's get on it.

547
00:41:55,825 --> 00:41:58,158
- Mm-hmm.
- Thank you.

548
00:42:01,892 --> 00:42:04,525
- Can I get a spoon, please?
- Of course.

549
00:42:04,658 --> 00:42:05,758
- There you go.
- Thanks.

550
00:42:05,892 --> 00:42:08,124

You're a liar.

you were not pregnant.

What do you want from me?

666
00:51:39,024 --> 00:51:41,591
I want you to speak
to your government...

667
00:51:43,459 --> 00:51:46,625
and let them know
if they don't pay the ransom,

668
00:51:47,492 --> 00:51:49,758
Saturday night

669

you and your child

Can I ask how much
I'm worth?

671
00:52:05,924 --> 00:52:07,558
Ten million dollars.

[humorless chuckle]

675
00:52:19,957 --> 00:52:23,326

all the innocent men,

677
00:52:27,124 --> 00:52:29,525

has killed.

We have yet
to debrief him.

685
00:53:22,259 --> 00:53:24,091
[Younes]
He was dropped off.

686
00:53:24,225 --> 00:53:27,658
Or rather, thrown off
a pickup truck.

687
00:53:27,792 --> 00:53:31,326
Tied up and gagged at a checkpoint
near our side of the border.

688
00:53:32,326 --> 00:53:34,491
He was instructed
to deliver proof of life.

689
00:53:34,625 --> 00:53:37,991
My guys drove him to Rabat,
and here we are.

690
00:53:38,957 --> 00:53:40,658
[Brad] El Hadi wants a show.

691
00:53:41,525 --> 00:53:44,326
He wants mainstream
video coverage.

692
00:53:45,458 --> 00:53:47,192
There's no online videos yet?

693
00:53:47,924 --> 00:53:49,326
No, nothing yet.

694
00:53:50,692 --> 00:53:55,125
I mean, sending proof of life
with a hostage is so old school.

695
00:53:55,259 --> 00:53:57,225
It's like a fuckin' movie.

They started
a livestream.

698
00:54:01,792 --> 00:54:03,725
[Jean]
It is therefore...

699
00:54:03,857 --> 00:54:05,792
we ask our respective
governments

700
00:54:05,924 --> 00:54:07,957
to pay the sum
of $10 million cash

701
00:54:08,092 --> 00:54:10,891
<i>for our safe release.</i>

702
00:54:11,024 --> 00:54:13,092
<i>Otherwise, we will
meet our death</i>

703
00:54:13,225 --> 00:54:16,292
<i>this Saturday after
the evening prayer.</i>

704
00:54:19,058 --> 00:54:20,159
[in Arabic] Speak!

705
00:54:23,024 --> 00:54:25,658
[Kate] <i>I would like
the US government to consider</i>

706
00:54:25,792 --> 00:54:29,525
that if they cause
my death...

707
00:54:30,924 --> 00:54:34,792
that it is also the death
of my unborn child,

708
00:54:34,924 --> 00:54:37,292
<i>as I am pregnant.</i>

709
00:54:57,658 --> 00:54:59,192
[Fitz sighs]

710
00:55:01,458 --> 00:55:03,092
[Brad] The hostage
said they drove him

711
00:55:03,225 --> 00:55:04,857
less than ten hours
to the border.

712
00:55:04,991 --> 00:55:06,792
They made one stop
along the way,

713
00:55:06,924 --> 00:55:08,824
probably to refuel.

714
00:55:08,957 --> 00:55:11,891
El Hadi's mother is from
Abadla, in Algeria.

715
00:55:12,025 --> 00:55:14,491
Small town.
Not very populated.

716
00:55:14,625 --> 00:55:16,558
Villages all around.

717
00:55:16,692 --> 00:55:20,059
How far is that town from the
border point where Kate was taken?

718
00:55:22,259 --> 00:55:24,491
I'd say at least
a seven-hour drive.

719
00:55:30,758 --> 00:55:31,957
Close enough.

720
00:55:32,092 --> 00:55:34,425
[Issam typing]

721
00:55:37,358 --> 00:55:39,491
[Issam] This is how
it looks from above.

722
00:55:56,184 --> 00:55:58,483
The image may be old.

723
00:55:58,616 --> 00:56:01,317
Are there any cell towers in that
area, any unusual activity?

724
00:56:01,450 --> 00:56:06,184
Nah, nothing unusual. We didn't
set up a proper comm surveillance.

725
00:56:08,716 --> 00:56:09,949
Can I get a copy of that?

726
00:56:10,082 --> 00:56:11,583
Roger that.

727
00:56:15,650 --> 00:56:17,616
[in Arabic]

728
00:56:17,750 --> 00:56:21,317
[in Arabic]

729
00:56:30,317 --> 00:56:31,583
Let's move out.

730
00:57:19,416 --> 00:57:22,083
[gunfire, explosions]

731
00:57:24,550 --> 00:57:27,184
- [muffled shouting]
- [gunfire]

732
00:57:27,316 --> 00:57:30,284
[Brad] Fall back, fall back!
Fall back, guys!

733
00:57:33,483 --> 00:57:34,949
[grunts]

734
00:57:35,083 --> 00:57:36,750
[high-pitched whine]

735
00:57:36,883 --> 00:57:38,483
[muffled]
You all right?

736
00:57:39,416 --> 00:57:41,583
[normal volume]
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

737
00:57:47,383 --> 00:57:50,017
I want to thank you
for looking out for me.

738
00:57:50,450 --> 00:57:51,949
Of course.

739
00:57:52,083 --> 00:57:55,383
There's not a lot of people
I trust around here, you know?

740
00:57:57,949 --> 00:57:59,716
[sighs]

741
00:58:02,616 --> 00:58:04,650
I really wanted to stay
that day back in Syria.

742
00:58:04,783 --> 00:58:06,316
Oh, man, don't...

743
00:58:06,983 --> 00:58:10,316
Yeah, not now.
Ancient history.

744
00:58:10,450 --> 00:58:13,150
That mission was doomed
from the start.

745
00:58:13,883 --> 00:58:15,850
Tell me about it.

746
00:58:15,983 --> 00:58:17,949
Don't beat yourself up
about it, man.

747
00:58:18,083 --> 00:58:20,217
Just part of the job, okay?

748
00:58:23,117 --> 00:58:24,716
This one's off the books.

749
00:58:38,783 --> 00:58:40,983
[in Arabic]

750
00:58:50,750 --> 00:58:52,516
[vehicle approaching]

751
00:59:16,083 --> 00:59:17,450
Wait a minute.

752
00:59:22,050 --> 00:59:23,383
[in Arabic]

753
00:59:23,516 --> 00:59:24,683
[in Arabic]

754
00:59:55,950 --> 00:59:57,950
[wind whistling]

755
01:00:02,249 --> 01:00:04,249
[fire crackling]

756
01:00:11,183 --> 01:00:13,117
I'm going in there
with you, Brad.

757
01:00:13,884 --> 01:00:16,149
That was not the deal.

758
01:00:17,283 --> 01:00:19,117
I owe you my life.

759
01:00:21,383 --> 01:00:23,550
I prefer to keep it
that way.

760
01:00:26,349 --> 01:00:28,683
You will never
make it alone.

761
01:00:30,683 --> 01:00:32,083
You need me.

762
01:00:40,383 --> 01:00:42,516
[no audible dialogue]

763
01:00:46,583 --> 01:00:48,183
[whimpering]

764
01:00:49,583 --> 01:00:51,149
[gasps]

765
01:00:53,683 --> 01:00:55,083
Are you all right?

766
01:00:58,216 --> 01:01:00,349
Can you handle
what's coming?

767
01:01:03,017 --> 01:01:04,516
[exhales]

768
01:01:07,083 --> 01:01:10,416
I love this woman more than
anything in this world.

769
01:01:12,316 --> 01:01:14,516
I'll do whatever it takes.

770
01:01:22,450 --> 01:01:25,550
[call to prayer broadcasting
over loudspeaker]

771
01:01:33,050 --> 01:01:36,149
[call to prayer repeats]

772
01:02:05,349 --> 01:02:06,650
[imam]
<i>Allahu Akbar.</i>

773
01:02:06,784 --> 01:02:08,650
<i>Allahu Akbar.</i>

774
01:02:12,583 --> 01:02:16,516
[all]
<i>Allahu Akbar.</i>

775
01:02:16,650 --> 01:02:19,483
[imam recites prayers
in Arabic]

776
01:02:22,784 --> 01:02:26,082
[continues prayer]

777
01:02:44,983 --> 01:02:46,349
[man] Hey!

778
01:02:47,683 --> 01:02:49,383
[in Arabic]

779
01:02:50,149 --> 01:02:51,683
[in Arabic]

780
01:03:05,016 --> 01:03:06,316
[in Arabic]

781
01:03:21,516 --> 01:03:23,516
[in Arabic]

782
01:03:33,818 --> 01:03:37,149
[in English] Why do you tell me this?
What do you want from me?

783
01:03:37,283 --> 01:03:41,383
[in English] El Hadi is demanding a $10
million ransom to release some hostages.

784
01:03:41,516 --> 01:03:43,918
We don't think he needs
all of that money.

785
01:03:44,049 --> 01:03:45,918
His army's
not big enough.

786
01:03:46,049 --> 01:03:48,349
There are brothers all around the
world that can use some of that.

787
01:03:48,483 --> 01:03:50,316
[in English] We want to
negotiate with him...

788
01:03:50,450 --> 01:03:52,483
I have nothing
to do with this.

789
01:03:56,483 --> 01:03:57,884
Who are you?

790
01:03:58,016 --> 01:04:01,684
I am brother Abdur Raheem
Williams from Detroit, Michigan.

791
01:04:03,216 --> 01:04:06,617
How come I've never heard
about a brother from Detroit?

792
01:04:06,751 --> 01:04:08,949
I've traveled all around the
world in the name of our cause,

793
01:04:09,082 --> 01:04:12,684
but in America,
we operate quietly, as we must.

794
01:04:19,049 --> 01:04:20,784
Who sent you?

795
01:04:20,917 --> 01:04:22,851
The less you know,
the better.

796
01:04:23,651 --> 01:04:25,249
I'll make sure you
and your people

797
01:04:25,383 --> 01:04:27,349
are compensated
for your assistance.

798
01:04:27,483 --> 01:04:30,216
We need to send El Hadi
a message of our arrival,

799
01:04:30,349 --> 01:04:33,283
and we'd appreciate
transportation to get there.

800
01:05:03,818 --> 01:05:05,450
Come with me, please.

801
01:05:28,216 --> 01:05:32,316
I'm not helping you because you say
that you're Abdur Raheem Williams.

802
01:05:32,450 --> 01:05:34,751
I'll help you because
God gave you the gift

803
01:05:35,516 --> 01:05:37,850
to make
the difference...

804
01:05:37,982 --> 01:05:40,551
between the good
and the bad.

805
01:05:48,617 --> 01:05:49,982
[in Arabic]

806
01:05:51,149 --> 01:05:52,416
[in English]
You have our gratitude.

807
01:05:52,551 --> 01:05:54,584
Your help will always
be remembered.

808
01:05:56,784 --> 01:05:58,416
Please, um...

809
01:05:58,551 --> 01:06:00,684
Please accept this
for the mosque.

810
01:06:01,850 --> 01:06:03,651
For the car, at least.

811
01:06:17,751 --> 01:06:19,249
Mr. Williams...

812
01:06:20,016 --> 01:06:22,149
be careful.

813
01:06:22,283 --> 01:06:25,216
Those people have
nothing to do with Islam.

814
01:06:25,349 --> 01:06:27,651
I may very well be
sending you to your death.

815
01:06:27,783 --> 01:06:30,416
My cause is worthy
of my death.

816
01:06:48,750 --> 01:06:51,116
[Younes] It should be
behind that tree.

817
01:06:53,917 --> 01:06:55,283
[Brad] Got it!

818
01:07:07,049 --> 01:07:08,651
You were right.

819
01:07:08,783 --> 01:07:09,982
About what?

820
01:07:10,116 --> 01:07:11,783
You don't need me.

821
01:07:12,451 --> 01:07:14,517
You can do just fine
on your own.

822
01:07:15,383 --> 01:07:17,383
Well, we're not there yet.

823
01:07:18,850 --> 01:07:19,917
We're being followed.

824
01:07:20,049 --> 01:07:21,982
Or escorted.

825
01:07:22,116 --> 01:07:25,016
We should have no trouble
finding El Hadi now.

826
01:07:25,149 --> 01:07:28,817
- How do you figure?
- Despite what the imam says,

827
01:07:28,949 --> 01:07:30,817
those men must work
for El Hadi.

828
01:07:30,949 --> 01:07:34,116
I'm sure they're trying to give him
a heads-up that we're on our way.

829
01:07:34,249 --> 01:07:36,949
Once we get to Abadla,
let's lose 'em...

830
01:07:37,817 --> 01:07:39,451
then we follow them.

831
01:09:12,384 --> 01:09:14,716
Well, hello, hello, hello.

832
01:09:16,317 --> 01:09:20,082
- That was almost too easy.
- Yeah.

833
01:09:23,949 --> 01:09:26,350
Thanks for the escort, guys.

834
01:09:28,350 --> 01:09:30,417
Let's get this party started.

835
01:09:36,982 --> 01:09:39,183
[spews coffee]

836
01:09:39,317 --> 01:09:41,650
[President] <i>Earl, I know
I'm stating the obvious,</i>

837
01:09:41,783 --> 01:09:43,817
<i>but we have exactly
two hours...</i>

838
01:09:43,949 --> 01:09:45,883
<i>two hours before
the execution</i>

839
01:09:46,016 --> 01:09:49,484
<i>of a pregnant, innocent American
woman and a French citizen.</i>

840
01:09:49,616 --> 01:09:52,016
[Secretary of State] <i>We have not
been able to get the Algerians</i>

841
01:09:52,149 --> 01:09:53,883
<i>to agree to anything.</i>

842
01:09:54,016 --> 01:09:56,551
They want our support in the UN
vote, but we cannot allow...

843
01:09:56,683 --> 01:09:59,683
Madam Secretary. Please.
I don't mean to interrupt,

844
01:09:59,817 --> 01:10:03,750
but the gentleman that we are
dealing with is batshit crazy.

845
01:10:03,883 --> 01:10:06,949
All he wants is for the US
to be on its knees

846
01:10:07,082 --> 01:10:08,783
and to get ISIS cred.

847
01:10:08,917 --> 01:10:11,082
And he has both,
so I suggest

848
01:10:11,216 --> 01:10:13,350
that we send in
the SEALs immediately.

849
01:10:13,484 --> 01:10:16,517
Uh, well, I'd give you
90% probability

850
01:10:16,650 --> 01:10:18,850
the Algerians
would try to stop us.

851
01:10:18,982 --> 01:10:20,384
Of course they will.

852
01:10:22,683 --> 01:10:25,417
Mr. President,
we're nowhere near ready

853
01:10:25,550 --> 01:10:27,082
<i>for a Title 50 operation.</i>

854
01:10:27,216 --> 01:10:29,583
- We don't have the intel.
- Yes, we do.

855
01:10:49,716 --> 01:10:51,583
[silenced gunfire]

856
01:10:57,451 --> 01:10:58,550
[grunts]

857
01:10:58,683 --> 01:10:59,917
Rogue assets?

858
01:11:00,049 --> 01:11:01,484
Who are they?
What are they doing?

859
01:11:01,616 --> 01:11:04,149
One of Morocco's
top secret agents

860
01:11:04,284 --> 01:11:06,783
and one of our own
have entered Algerian territory

861
01:11:06,917 --> 01:11:08,484
<i>to rescue the hostages.</i>

862
01:11:08,616 --> 01:11:10,082
One of our own? Who?

863
01:11:10,217 --> 01:11:13,016
Captain Brad Paxton.

864
01:11:13,149 --> 01:11:15,217
[President]
<i>Captain Paxton? The marine.</i>

865
01:11:15,350 --> 01:11:17,750
Yes. Kate Paxton
is his wife.

866
01:11:18,451 --> 01:11:20,082
Do we know
where they are?

867
01:11:20,217 --> 01:11:22,650
[Williams] <i>They have located
the terrorist compound.</i>

868
01:11:22,783 --> 01:11:24,116
And how do we
know this?

869
01:11:24,250 --> 01:11:27,082
They're communicating
with Moroccan authorities.

870
01:11:27,217 --> 01:11:29,016
[man]
<i>Mr. President,</i>

871
01:11:29,149 --> 01:11:31,683
there's not enough time here for
any kind of military response...

872
01:11:31,817 --> 01:11:34,483
Find out. Bring me
all tactical options.

873
01:11:39,616 --> 01:11:40,650
What do we got?

874
01:11:42,982 --> 01:11:45,284
I'd say 300 meters.

875
01:11:52,450 --> 01:11:54,616
We need all four
in four shots.

876
01:11:57,082 --> 01:11:58,516

01:31:40,983 --> 01:31:42,483
Can I offer you some tea?

1057
01:31:42,616 --> 01:31:44,716
- No, thank you.
- Have a seat.

1058
01:31:46,083 --> 01:31:47,483
[sighs]

1059
01:31:49,650 --> 01:31:52,184
I was not supposed
to be taken.

1060
01:31:52,316 --> 01:31:53,950
That was not the deal.

1061
01:31:55,383 --> 01:31:57,950
You were never
in any danger.

1062
01:31:59,150 --> 01:32:01,083
And you handled it
very well,

1063
01:32:01,217 --> 01:32:03,416
Amir, very well.

1064
01:32:05,050 --> 01:32:07,516
Your rookie fear
notwithstanding.

1065
01:32:11,184 --> 01:32:13,917
You're now an American citizen
and a CIA asset.

1066
01:32:14,050 --> 01:32:16,683
You should be very,
very proud.

1067
01:32:19,550 --> 01:32:20,683
Thank you.

1068
01:32:32,783 --> 01:32:34,950
[silenced gunshots on phone]

1069
01:32:42,716 --> 01:32:45,184
I do love seeing

1070
01:32:45,316 --> 01:32:51,283
good old-fashioned CIA work
in action.

1071
01:32:52,850 --> 01:32:54,616
There's nothin' like it.

1072
01:32:56,183 --> 01:32:59,083
Two SEALs died
last night.

1073
01:33:02,117 --> 01:33:05,283
Cost of American freedom.

1074
01:33:05,416 --> 01:33:06,616
Mm-hmm.

1075
01:33:10,216 --> 01:33:12,050
[Fitz] The ambassador.

1076
01:33:14,216 --> 01:33:16,050
What about him?

1077
01:33:19,216 --> 01:33:22,383
They suspect something.
The Moroccans do too.

1078
01:33:27,616 --> 01:33:30,349
There are matters...

1079
01:33:31,316 --> 01:33:33,616
kings, presidents...

1080
01:33:34,283 --> 01:33:37,516
and ambassadors
better not...

1081
01:33:39,884 --> 01:33:41,249
know.

1082
01:33:44,950 --> 01:33:46,983
Let's make sure of that.

1083
01:34:04,918 --> 01:34:07,249
