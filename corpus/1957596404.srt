[Sophia speaking Spanish]

181
00:09:16,348 --> 00:09:19,284
Oh, oh, okay, hey, are Charley
and Beth inside already?

182
00:09:19,317 --> 00:09:23,422
[Sophia speaking Spanish]

183
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:25,924
[Emily speaking Spanish]

184
00:09:25,957 --> 00:09:28,293
Wow, your Spanish is
getting really good.

185
00:09:29,461 --> 00:09:30,295
Gracias.

186
00:09:33,699 --> 00:09:35,333
[Sophia speaking Spanish]

187
00:09:35,367 --> 00:09:38,403
I absolutely loved your
last episode, Rachel.

188
00:09:38,437 --> 00:09:39,671
I bought that
miracle green juice

189
00:09:39,705 --> 00:09:41,473
and it's working
wonders on my skin.

190
00:09:41,506 --> 00:09:42,774
I'm so happy.

191
00:09:42,808 --> 00:09:44,009
And you have to tell me

192
00:09:44,042 --> 00:09:45,677
where you got those
shoes you are wearing.

193
00:09:45,711 --> 00:09:47,746
You must give me
your stylist's info.

194
00:09:47,779 --> 00:09:49,314
[Sophia speaking Spanish]

195
00:09:49,347 --> 00:09:51,483
[gentle upbeat music]

196
00:09:51,516 --> 00:09:54,386
Oh, this is not
shoes, it's bricks.

197
00:09:54,419 --> 00:09:56,855
[Lance grunts]

198
00:09:56,888 --> 00:09:57,789
You leave your
guitar case here,

199
00:09:57,823 --> 00:09:59,458
I can come back out and get it.

200
00:09:59,491 --> 00:10:02,360
Oh, no, no, it's got a
finicky handle, so I got it.

201
00:10:02,394 --> 00:10:06,298
Okay.

202
00:10:06,331 --> 00:10:07,466
Ooh, you all right, babe?

203
00:10:07,499 --> 00:10:10,268
Yeah, no, I can.

204
00:10:10,302 --> 00:10:10,902
[Kasey] Okay?

205
00:10:10,936 --> 00:10:12,804
[Emily] I got it.

206
00:10:12,838 --> 00:10:13,638
[sighs]

207
00:10:13,672 --> 00:10:14,506
I love this house.

208
00:10:16,341 --> 00:10:17,743
Yeah, it's beautiful.

209
00:10:17,776 --> 00:10:22,781
[gentle upbeat music]

210
00:10:31,423 --> 00:10:32,691
Hey, you guys!

211
00:10:32,724 --> 00:10:34,059
How was the drive, alright?

212
00:10:34,092 --> 00:10:37,362
You would know if
you had called me back.

213
00:10:37,395 --> 00:10:38,997
I thought your phone died.

214
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:40,432
Oh yeah.

215
00:10:40,465 --> 00:10:42,701
I didn't know you guys
were bringing Kasey.

216
00:10:42,734 --> 00:10:43,902
Well, neither did we.

217
00:10:45,003 --> 00:10:46,037
[speaking Spanish]

218
00:10:46,071 --> 00:10:46,905
Good choice.

219
00:10:49,508 --> 00:10:51,009
What is all this?

220
00:10:51,042 --> 00:10:52,577
George and I are blue,

221
00:10:52,611 --> 00:10:55,480
Kasey is green,
Carrie is purple,

222
00:10:55,514 --> 00:10:58,517
and Rachel, you and
your family have pink.

223
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:00,519
Just put it on
everything that you want.

224
00:11:02,387 --> 00:11:05,056
Is there anything left?

225
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:07,392
What, little sis, no hug?

226
00:11:09,928 --> 00:11:12,531
Hi, hi!

227
00:11:12,564 --> 00:11:13,331
How are you?

228
00:11:14,533 --> 00:11:15,467
Is that valuable?

229
00:11:17,035 --> 00:11:19,371
It's probably worth
a couple thousand.

230
00:11:19,404 --> 00:11:20,438
That's great.

231
00:11:22,974 --> 00:11:24,543
Kasey, this isn't a game.

232
00:11:25,443 --> 00:11:26,812
[Kasey] I know.

233
00:11:26,845 --> 00:11:30,649
[gentle upbeat music continues]

234
00:11:30,682 --> 00:11:32,450
What are y'all
doing to my house?

235
00:11:33,685 --> 00:11:35,387
[Sophia speaking Spanish]

236
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:37,856
If you see something that
you like, you just use this.

237
00:11:39,658 --> 00:11:41,793
It's mine and my
family traditions.

238
00:11:41,827 --> 00:11:44,529
And technically
this is mom's house.

239
00:11:44,563 --> 00:11:47,566
I live here and some of
these things belong to me.

240
00:11:47,599 --> 00:11:48,800
We can do this later, sweetie.

241
00:11:48,834 --> 00:11:50,136
No, we're not
doing this later.

242
00:11:50,169 --> 00:11:52,571
Besides, mom left a will.

243
00:11:52,604 --> 00:11:54,739
I bought this lamp, it's mine.

244
00:11:54,773 --> 00:11:56,541
Calm down, it's just a lamp.

245
00:11:56,575 --> 00:11:58,076
But it's my lamp.

246
00:11:58,109 --> 00:12:00,779
I'm sure Mom split
everything up evenly.

247
00:12:00,812 --> 00:12:03,048
She can't split
up my possessions.

248
00:12:03,081 --> 00:12:05,483
We should discuss what we're
gonna do with this house.

249
00:12:08,119 --> 00:12:10,689
Oh, finally, you're all here.

250
00:12:10,722 --> 00:12:12,123
Who's this guy?

251
00:12:12,158 --> 00:12:14,492
Well, I am really excited
to get this started.

252
00:12:14,526 --> 00:12:16,461
Well, not the burial, of course,

253
00:12:16,494 --> 00:12:17,462
[chuckles]

254
00:12:17,495 --> 00:12:19,898
That would be inappropriate,
but everything else,

255
00:12:19,931 --> 00:12:22,434
everything else, I'm really
excited to get started.

256
00:12:22,467 --> 00:12:24,870
You know what, never mind,
I'll just introduce myself.

257
00:12:24,903 --> 00:12:28,039
I am Mr. Shepard, I'm
your mother's attorney.

258
00:12:28,073 --> 00:12:30,575
I am also the
executor of her will.

259
00:12:30,609 --> 00:12:33,545
Oh, good, okay, are
we gonna read that now?

260
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:35,046
[laughs]

261
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,681
I'm gonna like you.

262
00:12:36,715 --> 00:12:38,617
Kasey, Kasey Striker.

263
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:40,619
Oh, now, did you marry?

264
00:12:40,652 --> 00:12:42,821
Because I didn't see your
husband's name on the list.

265
00:12:42,854 --> 00:12:46,091
Her last name is DuBose,
Striker is made up.

266
00:12:46,124 --> 00:12:47,993
It's her stage name.

267
00:12:48,026 --> 00:12:51,463
Rachel DuBose, I've been
looking forward to meeting you.

268
00:12:51,496 --> 00:12:52,464
I'm a huge fan.

269
00:12:52,497 --> 00:12:54,599
- Oh, thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

270
00:12:55,734 --> 00:12:57,669
I actually legally
changed it, so.

271
00:12:59,104 --> 00:13:00,505
Wonderful.

272
00:13:00,538 --> 00:13:03,575
Follow me, and we will
lay your mother to rest.

273
00:13:05,244 --> 00:13:06,544
We're burying her here?

274
00:13:06,578 --> 00:13:08,647
We're spreading her ashes.

275
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,916
Didn't you read the letter
that Mr. Shepard sent?

276
00:13:13,785 --> 00:13:17,189
[gentle mournful music]

277
00:13:22,161 --> 00:13:23,561
I want you all to know

278
00:13:23,595 --> 00:13:26,232
that your mom was an
exceptional woman.

279
00:13:26,265 --> 00:13:28,633
And over the past weeks, I've
spent a lot of time with her,

280
00:13:28,667 --> 00:13:30,835
and she put a lot
of time into this.

281
00:13:30,869 --> 00:13:34,639
And she asked that I begin
by reading the Lord's prayer.

282
00:13:34,673 --> 00:13:37,575
Our Father in heaven,
hallowed be Your name.

283
00:13:37,609 --> 00:13:39,611
Your kingdom come,
Your will be done

284
00:13:39,644 --> 00:13:41,012
on Earth as it is in heaven.

285
00:13:41,046 --> 00:13:43,548
Give us today our daily bread
and forgive us our debts

286
00:13:43,581 --> 00:13:45,116
as we forgive our debtors.

287
00:13:45,151 --> 00:13:46,918
Lead us not into temptation,

288
00:13:46,952 --> 00:13:48,620
but deliver us
from the evil one,

289
00:13:48,653 --> 00:13:50,588
for Thine is the
kingdom and the power

290
00:13:50,622 --> 00:13:53,491
and the glory forever, amen.

291
00:13:53,525 --> 00:13:54,160
Amen.

292
00:13:55,794 --> 00:13:57,495
Mom's favorite scripture was,

293
00:13:57,529 --> 00:13:58,930
"There is a time for everything

294
00:14:00,299 --> 00:14:02,968
and a season for every
activity under the heavens,

295
00:14:04,203 --> 00:14:06,838
a time to be born
and a time to die,"

296
00:14:08,174 --> 00:14:10,775
Ecclesiastes 3:1-2.

297
00:14:13,078 --> 00:14:17,183
Mom cherished every moment,
lived her life to the fullest.

298
00:14:18,184 --> 00:14:22,053
She truly believed that
what you sow here on earth,

299
00:14:22,087 --> 00:14:23,155
you reap in heaven.

300
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:28,860
She believed that's where we
receive our true inheritance.

301
00:14:30,028 --> 00:14:31,997
But everything here
on earth is fleeting.

302
00:14:33,631 --> 00:14:36,268
She talked a lot about
that in her final days.

303
00:14:37,303 --> 00:14:39,804
Y'all would know that if
you had bothered to visit.

304
00:14:40,805 --> 00:14:42,674
[gentle mournful music]

305
00:14:42,707 --> 00:14:43,675
Mom was a winner.

306
00:14:44,776 --> 00:14:46,911
She brought this
family into greatness

307
00:14:46,945 --> 00:14:48,580
and her legacy will live on.

308
00:14:50,682 --> 00:14:52,184
I'm gonna name a
street after her.

309
00:14:54,286 --> 00:14:57,756
Mom, every Monday,

310
00:14:57,789 --> 00:15:00,759
there was a note on my
dressing room table from you.

311
00:15:01,659 --> 00:15:04,763
You'd write an encouraging
scripture verse

312
00:15:04,796 --> 00:15:07,699
and you always reminded me
to put other people first.

313
00:15:09,734 --> 00:15:10,769
I'm going to miss that.

314
00:15:12,737 --> 00:15:15,673
Grandma, I'm gonna
miss you so much,

315
00:15:18,043 --> 00:15:21,012
but I know, that I'm gonna
see you again in heaven.

316
00:15:24,316 --> 00:15:27,752
Thank you for calling me every
night just to pray with me,

317
00:15:29,255 --> 00:15:31,823
for always encouraging
me to go to youth group.

318
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:34,926
Your mother accepted
me into this family

319
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:38,696
for who I was with
unconditional love.

320
00:15:40,166 --> 00:15:45,171
[gentle mournful music]

321
00:15:47,772 --> 00:15:51,643
All come from dust
and to dust all return.

322
00:16:07,859 --> 00:16:10,762
Okay, so are we
gonna read the will?

323
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:13,898
That's what you have to say?

324
00:16:13,932 --> 00:16:15,767
I need to know
what I'm gonna get.

325
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,669
Yes, here we are.

326
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:20,306
You have activated
the special rule.

327
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:24,843
If any of my children ask
about their inheritance

328
00:16:24,876 --> 00:16:27,812
within five minutes
of spreading my ashes,

329
00:16:27,846 --> 00:16:29,848
read the two
following scriptures:

330
00:16:29,881 --> 00:16:32,717
The kingdom of heaven is like
a treasure hidden in a field.

331
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:34,953
When a man found
it, he hid it again,

332
00:16:34,986 --> 00:16:37,856
and then in his joy
went and sold all he had

333
00:16:37,889 --> 00:16:39,358
and bought that field.

334
00:16:39,391 --> 00:16:42,228
So was fulfilled what was
spoken through the prophets,

335
00:16:42,261 --> 00:16:44,296
"I will open my
mouth in parables.

336
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:48,099
I will utter things hidden since
the creation of the world."

337
00:16:48,134 --> 00:16:51,736
Inform my children that the
deed is hidden on the property.

338
00:16:51,769 --> 00:16:55,274
The first one to find it shall
inherit my entire estate.

339
00:16:55,307 --> 00:16:58,676
[gentle upbeat music]

340
00:16:59,944 --> 00:17:00,745
What?

341
00:17:02,148 --> 00:17:03,948
A treasure in a field?

342
00:17:05,217 --> 00:17:06,718
Just read the will.

343
00:17:06,751 --> 00:17:08,086
Oh, I don't have it.

344
00:17:08,119 --> 00:17:09,787
Where is it?

345
00:17:09,821 --> 00:17:12,023
It appears it's hidden
somewhere on the property.

346
00:17:12,056 --> 00:17:14,160
[Carrie laughs]

347
00:17:14,193 --> 00:17:16,128
I don't know anything.

348
00:17:16,162 --> 00:17:17,862
You didn't know Mom
was gonna do this?

349
00:17:17,896 --> 00:17:19,697
Nope, she didn't tell me.

350
00:17:21,433 --> 00:17:23,735
I don't believe
Mom would do this.

351
00:17:23,768 --> 00:17:25,237
This is a joke, right?

352
00:17:25,271 --> 00:17:28,740
Mr. Shepard, we all
traveled a very long way.

353
00:17:28,773 --> 00:17:31,910
We came here for one night
to put Mom's affairs in order

354
00:17:31,943 --> 00:17:33,412
and lay her to rest.

355
00:17:33,445 --> 00:17:37,283
This is not the appropriate
time for games and tricks.

356
00:17:37,316 --> 00:17:38,783
I understand.

357
00:17:38,816 --> 00:17:41,453
If any of my children ask
about their inheritance

358
00:17:41,487 --> 00:17:43,087
within five minutes
of the service,

359
00:17:43,121 --> 00:17:45,857
you will inform them that
the deed can be found

360
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:47,792
somewhere on the property.

361
00:17:47,825 --> 00:17:49,928
- Now it also says that-
- Yeah, yeah.

362
00:17:49,961 --> 00:17:51,163
I think we got
that, we heard that.

363
00:17:51,197 --> 00:17:52,864
What does this mean?

364
00:17:52,897 --> 00:17:55,167
It means first to find the
deed inherits everything.

365
00:17:59,538 --> 00:18:02,774
What, like you guys didn't
wanna know what you inherited.

366
00:18:02,807 --> 00:18:05,511
I think Mom meant for
me to have the house.

367
00:18:05,544 --> 00:18:08,380
I have lived here my
entire life, I should get it.

368
00:18:08,414 --> 00:18:10,316
No, no, no, I'm the
oldest, I should get it.

369
00:18:10,349 --> 00:18:12,917
I meant that, we
should all get it,

370
00:18:12,951 --> 00:18:15,853
that Mom would want us
to all have the house.

371
00:18:15,887 --> 00:18:18,324
Well, obviously not, and
we're not gonna keep it.

372
00:18:18,357 --> 00:18:21,759
We're gonna sell it, and we're
gonna split it 40/20/20/20.

373
00:18:21,793 --> 00:18:23,429
Why would you get 40%?

374
00:18:23,462 --> 00:18:25,164
Because I have the
least out of all of us.

375
00:18:25,197 --> 00:18:28,234
Listen, we each get 25%.

376
00:18:28,267 --> 00:18:29,535
I don't want to
sell this house.

377
00:18:29,568 --> 00:18:31,470
It's not up to just you.

378
00:18:31,503 --> 00:18:34,206
That's right, it's up to
the one who finds the deed.

379
00:18:35,873 --> 00:18:38,843
Rachel, you can buy
my share of the house.

380
00:18:38,876 --> 00:18:40,111
- No!
- Yeah.

381
00:18:40,145 --> 00:18:42,548
You know what, you
can buy mine, too.

382
00:18:42,581 --> 00:18:43,915
Where did Kasey go?

383
00:18:45,351 --> 00:18:47,286
The first one to find the
deed inherits everything,

384
00:18:47,319 --> 00:18:48,820
but there's a lot more
to it than that, though,

385
00:18:48,853 --> 00:18:50,322
if you would just indulge me.

386
00:18:51,323 --> 00:18:53,858
Well, I guess I'm just a
guy holding a rule book.

387
00:18:53,891 --> 00:18:55,127
[chuckles]

388
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:57,162
Emily, your
grandmother requested

389
00:18:57,196 --> 00:18:58,930
that this was all
documented with photos.

390
00:18:58,963 --> 00:19:00,165
Would you mind doing the honors?

391
00:19:00,199 --> 00:19:03,001
Yeah, yeah, of
course, you first.

392
00:19:03,034 --> 00:19:05,437
Oh, don't mind if I
do get my good side.

393
00:19:07,038 --> 00:19:07,839
[phone shutter clicks]

394
00:19:07,872 --> 00:19:08,507
Alright.

395
00:19:09,475 --> 00:19:12,076
Mom!

396
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:14,012
Where can I find good
reception around here, bro?

397
00:19:14,045 --> 00:19:15,847
No Wi-Fi on the premises, sir.

398
00:19:17,115 --> 00:19:18,484
Come on.

399
00:19:18,517 --> 00:19:21,886
[upbeat lively music]

400
00:20:00,626 --> 00:20:02,927
I don't see it, George.

401
00:20:03,928 --> 00:20:06,465
Sophia, why are you wearing
those ridiculous shoes?

402
00:20:06,498 --> 00:20:07,965
You don't have to act
a part here, you know.

403
00:20:07,999 --> 00:20:09,067
You could just be.

404
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:10,202
[Sophia speaking Spanish]

405
00:20:10,235 --> 00:20:11,637
They make me feel powerful.

406
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:14,038
Alright, it's not here.

407
00:20:14,072 --> 00:20:15,374
[speaks Spanish]

408
00:20:15,407 --> 00:20:20,412
[upbeat lively music]

409
00:21:34,353 --> 00:21:37,021
[Carrie] Mom would get such
a kick out of us right now.

410
00:21:37,054 --> 00:21:39,090
And Dad would just
be rolling his eyes.

411
00:21:40,459 --> 00:21:41,993
I'm not really dressed for this.

412
00:21:42,026 --> 00:21:44,028
George, you should've
left your shoes outside.

413
00:21:44,061 --> 00:21:46,030
You are tracking dirt
all through my house.

414
00:21:46,063 --> 00:21:47,433
You mean Mom and Dad's house.

415
00:21:47,466 --> 00:21:49,334
I packed plenty
of shoes, George.

416
00:21:49,368 --> 00:21:50,569
Thank you.

417
00:21:50,602 --> 00:21:52,271
Yeah, it's not just
your house, Carrie.

418
00:21:53,305 --> 00:21:54,473
You know, if I find this,

419
00:21:54,506 --> 00:21:56,341
I'm keeping the whole
thing for myself.

420
00:21:56,375 --> 00:21:58,042
This is our family home.

421
00:21:58,075 --> 00:22:00,978
Not if I find it,
those are the rules.

422
00:22:01,012 --> 00:22:02,548
Let's find a way to make
this fair for everyone.

423
00:22:02,581 --> 00:22:04,450
Huh, you haven't found
the deed yet, have you?

424
00:22:04,483 --> 00:22:08,320
This property is huge,
it could be anywhere on it.

425
00:22:08,353 --> 00:22:10,489
Indeed, as I've
tried to tell you,

426
00:22:10,522 --> 00:22:13,090
your mother left very
specific instructions

427
00:22:13,124 --> 00:22:14,726
if you're ready to listen to me.

428
00:22:17,629 --> 00:22:19,198
Good.

429
00:22:19,231 --> 00:22:20,532
Now there are challenges
that lead to clues

430
00:22:20,566 --> 00:22:22,501
that lead you
closer to the deed,

431
00:22:22,534 --> 00:22:24,101
but you have to work
together as a family

432
00:22:24,136 --> 00:22:27,372
to complete those challenges
and get those clues.

433
00:22:27,406 --> 00:22:28,707
Of course.

434
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:30,074
Got to be kidding me.

435
00:22:31,610 --> 00:22:34,713
She couldn't just die, she
had to have the last word.

436
00:22:34,746 --> 00:22:37,216
No, Kasey, you had
to have the last word.

437
00:22:37,249 --> 00:22:39,184
That's what started all of this.

438
00:22:40,486 --> 00:22:42,119
Okay, I thought I was done

439
00:22:42,154 --> 00:22:45,122
with all the little
kid stuff when I left.

440
00:22:45,157 --> 00:22:46,225
Why didn't you warn us, Carrie?

441
00:22:46,258 --> 00:22:47,259
You've been here the whole time.

442
00:22:47,292 --> 00:22:49,728
Thank you for acknowledging
that, I know I was.

443
00:22:49,761 --> 00:22:52,331
Again, you didn't know
Mom was making this game?

444
00:22:52,364 --> 00:22:53,632
Not this.

445
00:22:53,665 --> 00:22:54,800
I knew she was making something,

446
00:22:54,833 --> 00:22:56,802
but she was always making stuff.

447
00:22:56,835 --> 00:22:59,137
You know Mom, all the
way up to the end.

448
00:22:59,171 --> 00:23:00,639
What are you talking about?

449
00:23:00,672 --> 00:23:02,106
Mom's games.

450
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:03,642
[Sophia speaking Spanish]

451
00:23:03,675 --> 00:23:06,178
Remember that story I told
you about my 10th birthday?

452
00:23:06,211 --> 00:23:09,147
[Sophia speaking Spanish]

453
00:23:09,181 --> 00:23:13,252
Exactly, 10 friends,
10 clues, in 10 hours.

454
00:23:13,285 --> 00:23:16,388
I spent forever in
the barn looking for

455
00:23:16,421 --> 00:23:18,657
that stupid needle
in the haystack clue.

456
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:22,160
And all along, it was hidden
in the culvert by the road.

457
00:23:22,194 --> 00:23:25,764
I got stuck in there trying
to find that last clue.

458
00:23:25,797 --> 00:23:29,401
Ripped my favorite dress, still
have the scar to prove it.

459
00:23:29,434 --> 00:23:30,636
[all laughing]

460
00:23:30,669 --> 00:23:34,406
Wait, wait, you
climbed in a culvert?

461
00:23:34,439 --> 00:23:35,474
Like you, my, my mom?

462
00:23:35,507 --> 00:23:37,543
[all laughing]

463
00:23:37,576 --> 00:23:39,411
I really wanted to win.

464
00:23:39,444 --> 00:23:41,112
Yeah, but George always wins.

465
00:23:41,146 --> 00:23:43,282
Nothing wrong
with being a winner.

466
00:23:43,315 --> 00:23:44,750
Wait a minute, Mr. Shepard,

467
00:23:44,783 --> 00:23:47,185
you said that we have to all
work together to get the clues.

468
00:23:47,219 --> 00:23:49,120
That's what it says
right here in the book.

469
00:23:49,154 --> 00:23:50,689
But you also said
that the person

470
00:23:50,722 --> 00:23:53,325
who finds the deed gets
to inherit everything.

471
00:23:53,358 --> 00:23:54,826
Oh, the whole shebang.

472
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:56,194
It doesn't make any sense.

473
00:23:56,228 --> 00:23:57,629
Why would we all work together

474
00:23:57,663 --> 00:23:59,398
for one person to
get everything?

475
00:23:59,431 --> 00:24:02,834
Oh, that would be an excellent
question for your mother.

476
00:24:02,868 --> 00:24:05,237
But now that Kasey has
unlocked this part of the game,

477
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:08,440
I mean, I can only say
what's here in this book,

478
00:24:08,473 --> 00:24:10,676
and your mother was very
specific about all of this.

479
00:24:10,709 --> 00:24:13,345
I mean, look at this
book that she made.

480
00:24:13,378 --> 00:24:15,280
And she planned
everything right down

481
00:24:15,314 --> 00:24:17,249
to the smallest detail.

482
00:24:17,282 --> 00:24:21,186
Now, how this all turns out,
well, that's up to you all.

483
00:24:21,219 --> 00:24:22,521
So this is the only way

484
00:24:22,554 --> 00:24:24,323
we're going to get
our inheritance?

485
00:24:25,457 --> 00:24:26,792
No, we don't have to play.

486
00:24:26,825 --> 00:24:29,595
I mean, you could just
tell us where it is.

487
00:24:29,628 --> 00:24:31,797
No, it's legally binding.

488
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:35,167
Only Mom would make
a game legally binding.

489
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,635
We could fight it in court.

490
00:24:36,668 --> 00:24:37,836
Well, technically you can do

491
00:24:37,869 --> 00:24:39,705
whatever you want with the will.

492
00:24:39,738 --> 00:24:41,907
I mean, you can make the
terms whatever you like.

493
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:44,242
That's actually my specialty,

494
00:24:44,276 --> 00:24:45,877
strange contacts and agreements.

495
00:24:46,845 --> 00:24:48,246
That's why your mother hired me.

496
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:50,716
You know, I once had
a client that refused

497
00:24:50,749 --> 00:24:52,351
to give his family
their inheritance

498
00:24:52,384 --> 00:24:54,219
until each and every
one of them showed up

499
00:24:54,252 --> 00:24:56,655
to his funeral wearing
a chicken suit.

500
00:24:56,688 --> 00:24:57,823
[laughing]

501
00:24:57,856 --> 00:25:00,258
- You're kidding, right?
- Oh no, I'm not.

502
00:25:00,292 --> 00:25:03,195
But seriously, I'm with
Rachel, we should fight this.

503
00:25:03,228 --> 00:25:04,830
You might be able to fight it.

504
00:25:04,863 --> 00:25:07,232
But in the meantime, you
should know if someone

505
00:25:07,265 --> 00:25:10,369
or anyone finds that deed, well,

506
00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:13,338
they could inherit
the entire estate.

507
00:25:14,239 --> 00:25:15,674
My estate?

508
00:25:15,707 --> 00:25:18,377
Well, it's technically
not yours yet, settle down.

509
00:25:18,410 --> 00:25:19,344
So you're saying

510
00:25:19,378 --> 00:25:21,480
that even a non-family
member could inherit it?

511
00:25:21,513 --> 00:25:23,448
Oh yes, even the pizza guy.

512
00:25:23,482 --> 00:25:26,618
That's why I would recommend
that you find it here and now.

513
00:25:26,652 --> 00:25:28,220
Well, what about you?

514
00:25:28,253 --> 00:25:29,655
Oh, me?

515
00:25:29,688 --> 00:25:31,790
I, well, I'm the will's
executor, so I'm disqualified.

516
00:25:31,823 --> 00:25:33,592
It keeps everything
fair and legal.

517
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:38,196
Okay, let's get
this over with.

518
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:39,031
Excellent.

519
00:25:39,064 --> 00:25:40,766
If you'll follow me
into the kitchen,

520
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:43,268
I have your first
challenge prepared.

521
00:25:43,301 --> 00:25:45,671
Right this way, well, come on.

522
00:25:45,704 --> 00:25:48,874
[upbeat lively music]

523
00:25:55,547 --> 00:25:57,416
[Rachel] She made these!

524
00:25:57,449 --> 00:26:00,652
Yep, and I made
this one for myself.

525
00:26:00,686 --> 00:26:01,653
[all laughs]

526
00:26:01,687 --> 00:26:02,654
Look at that.

527
00:26:02,688 --> 00:26:04,523
Yeah, I'm not wearing this.

528
00:26:04,556 --> 00:26:07,592
Kasey, Mom worked
hard on these.

529
00:26:07,626 --> 00:26:09,528
Have some respect
for her dying wish.

530
00:26:09,561 --> 00:26:11,430
It's the least you can do.

531
00:26:12,564 --> 00:26:13,932
Yeah, but I don't cook.

532
00:26:13,965 --> 00:26:16,535
Where God cooks,
there is no smoke.

533
00:26:16,568 --> 00:26:19,237
You never learned
to cook, Kasey.

534
00:26:19,271 --> 00:26:20,505
Challenge number one.

535
00:26:20,539 --> 00:26:23,008
There's a time for
everything and a season

536
00:26:23,041 --> 00:26:24,710
for every activity
under the heavens.

537
00:26:24,743 --> 00:26:28,547
There's a time for war, and
there's a time for peace.

538
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:30,348
Mom used to say that
to me all the time

539
00:26:30,382 --> 00:26:31,750
when we were in the
kitchen together.

540
00:26:31,783 --> 00:26:34,519
Well, you must work together
to complete this challenge.

541
00:26:34,553 --> 00:26:36,655
The kingdom of
heaven is like yeast

542
00:26:36,688 --> 00:26:38,857
that a woman took and
mixed into the flour

543
00:26:38,890 --> 00:26:40,392
until it's worked
through the dough.

544
00:26:40,425 --> 00:26:42,327
Now, your meal must be completed

545
00:26:43,528 --> 00:26:45,297
and you must have the
full family experience

546
00:26:45,330 --> 00:26:46,998
from cooking to dining.

547
00:26:47,032 --> 00:26:49,701
I love the smell
of fresh bread.

548
00:26:49,735 --> 00:26:53,972
Not only that, it's the
whole DuBose Sunday dinner.

549
00:26:54,005 --> 00:26:55,440
[chuckles]

550
00:26:55,474 --> 00:26:57,375
Okay, let's, start
with the trinity.

551
00:26:57,409 --> 00:26:59,845
Here, Rachel, you chop that up.

552
00:27:01,046 --> 00:27:02,814
You mean mirepoix?

553
00:27:02,848 --> 00:27:05,450
Same thing, onions,
celery, carrots.

554
00:27:05,484 --> 00:27:08,353
The holy trinity of
French and Cajun cuisine.

555
00:27:08,386 --> 00:27:11,056
Start your meal with this
and it will be amazing.

556
00:27:11,089 --> 00:27:11,890
[chuckles]

557
00:27:11,923 --> 00:27:13,325
Mum loved mirepoix.

558
00:27:13,358 --> 00:27:15,427
She used to say, "Put
the trinity in your food

559
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:17,729
"and you'll put
it in your soul."

560
00:27:17,763 --> 00:27:19,064
You know what, Carrie?

561
00:27:19,097 --> 00:27:21,500
I miss your good
old-fashioned home cooking.

562
00:27:21,533 --> 00:27:23,935
Alright, put this on
the stove top to get hot.

563
00:27:23,969 --> 00:27:25,337
Okay.

564
00:27:25,370 --> 00:27:27,572
Kasey, boil some
water in here.

565
00:27:27,606 --> 00:27:29,608
- And, let's see-
- Nope!

566
00:27:29,641 --> 00:27:30,742
That does not qualify.

567
00:27:33,445 --> 00:27:34,379
Why not?

568
00:27:34,412 --> 00:27:37,382
All four siblings must
participate together

569
00:27:37,415 --> 00:27:39,451
in order to complete the
challenge and get the clue.

570
00:27:39,484 --> 00:27:40,519
- Oh.
- Kasey.

571
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,789
I don't make the rules.
I just hold the book.

572
00:27:43,822 --> 00:27:44,623
[sighs]

573
00:27:44,656 --> 00:27:45,490
I'll find her.

I was actually
looking for her guitar,

586
00:29:01,833 --> 00:29:04,502
but then I found this.

587
00:29:04,536 --> 00:29:05,770
Nice try, but you
gotta to join us.

588
00:29:05,804 --> 00:29:08,440
You know, I actually
can't remember this.

Let me see.

590
00:29:10,742 --> 00:29:11,910
You know what?

591
00:29:11,943 --> 00:29:13,979
This was your
kindergarten recital.

592
00:29:14,012 --> 00:29:14,813
You don't remember that?

593
00:29:14,846 --> 00:29:16,047
No.

594
00:29:16,081 --> 00:29:17,515
You stole the show.

595
00:29:17,549 --> 00:29:18,717
Aw!

596
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:19,651
You know, you
were always like me.

597
00:29:19,684 --> 00:29:20,619
Lighten up in front of a crowd.

598
00:29:20,652 --> 00:29:21,453
Ah.

599
00:29:21,486 --> 00:29:22,821
[George laughs]

600
00:29:22,854 --> 00:29:24,623
- Well, look at this one.
- Look at that!

601
00:29:24,656 --> 00:29:27,592
That's when we did
community theater together.

602
00:29:27,626 --> 00:29:30,695
- Wow, good times, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

603
00:29:32,097 --> 00:29:35,467
Now come on, join us,
besides, it's in the rules.

604

Oh, I don't care
about the rules.

605
00:29:37,636 --> 00:29:39,738
We'll get this over with
faster if we work together.

606
00:29:39,771 --> 00:29:42,674
That's not my problem, I'm
gonna find this thing first.

607
00:29:42,707 --> 00:29:44,609
Oh, and if you don't?

608
00:29:44,643 --> 00:29:46,444
Well then, one of
you good Samaritans

609
00:29:46,478 --> 00:29:47,646
will just share yours with me.

610
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:49,080
Hey, I did my
good deed last year

611
00:29:49,114 --> 00:29:50,548
when I loaned you that money.

612
00:29:52,651 --> 00:29:53,485
Huh.

613
00:29:54,519 --> 00:29:57,522
Well, then I might as well
just come on out and say it.

614
00:29:57,555 --> 00:29:58,590
This is stuck.

615
00:29:58,623 --> 00:29:59,624
Nice.

616
00:30:00,393 --> 00:30:01,760
You know, you always
seem to find yourself

617
00:30:01,793 --> 00:30:03,195
in these situations, Kasey.

618
00:30:03,229 --> 00:30:04,930
No, I think you always seem

619
00:30:04,963 --> 00:30:07,766
to find me in these situations.

620
00:30:07,799 --> 00:30:09,601
That doesn't look
like it's coming off.

621
00:30:09,634 --> 00:30:11,937
Ugh, I guess I'll
just have to keep it.

622
00:30:11,970 --> 00:30:15,774
Or we just take
off the whole finger.

623
00:30:15,807 --> 00:30:17,243
Hey.

624
00:30:17,276 --> 00:30:18,377
You know what?

625
00:30:18,411 --> 00:30:21,546
I have something in my room
that'll sort everything out.

626
00:30:21,579 --> 00:30:22,647
Trust me.

00:30:22,681 --> 00:30:25,650

00:30:28,954 --> 00:30:31,690
George, this
scratching my new oven.

629
00:30:31,723 --> 00:30:33,858
This is ridiculous
guys, uncuff me.

630
00:30:33,892 --> 00:30:35,227
[Rachel] We're
just protecting you

631
00:30:35,261 --> 00:30:36,761
from getting more rings stuck.

632
00:30:37,762 --> 00:30:39,597
Well, it was an accident.

633
00:30:39,631 --> 00:30:40,765
[Rachel] That's
my favorite ring.

634
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:42,067
Okay. Then I'll take it off.

635
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:43,735
Just uncuff me, I'll use soap.

636
00:30:43,768 --> 00:30:44,970
Do y'all remember that time

637
00:30:45,003 --> 00:30:47,173
when Kasey would not
come down for dinner?

638
00:30:47,206 --> 00:30:48,640
[laughs]

639
00:30:48,673 --> 00:30:49,841
Every time George
went up to get her,

640
00:30:49,874 --> 00:30:53,511
he'd come back down saying that
she wouldn't leave her room.

641
00:30:53,545 --> 00:30:54,779
And Mom finally
had to go up there

642
00:30:54,813 --> 00:30:56,848
and get you herself, remember?

643
00:30:56,881 --> 00:31:00,018
Yes, she found me
handcuffed to my bedpost.

644
00:31:00,051 --> 00:31:01,253
[Rachel laughs]

645
00:31:01,287 --> 00:31:02,687
That was the best
idea I ever had.

646
00:31:02,721 --> 00:31:04,190
Although I didn't
know I'd be reusing

647
00:31:04,223 --> 00:31:07,226
that same idea on you as
an adult to keep you around

648
00:31:07,259 --> 00:31:08,626
instead of to keep you away.

649
00:31:10,762 --> 00:31:11,696
You guys, you'll
get way more use

650
00:31:11,730 --> 00:31:13,098
out of me with two hands.

651
00:31:13,132 --> 00:31:15,000
You can trust me, I promise.

652
00:31:20,005 --> 00:31:22,574
[All] Prove it.

653

[bright lively music]

654
00:31:38,023 --> 00:31:40,592
Hey, let's say, Grace.

655
00:31:40,625 --> 00:31:41,826
Oh, come on.

656
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:45,297
Mom's not even here, we
don't have to do that.

657
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:51,237
Dear Lord, thank You
so much for this food.

658
00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:52,304
May it nourish our bodies

659
00:31:52,338 --> 00:31:55,774
and give us strength to
complete Mom's last request.

660
00:31:55,807 --> 00:31:57,143
- Amen.
- Amen.

661
00:31:57,176 --> 00:31:58,777
Amen.

662
00:31:58,810 --> 00:32:01,713
Okay, we're done,
what's the next clue?

663
00:32:03,149 --> 00:32:04,216
This is delicious, by the way.

664
00:32:04,250 --> 00:32:05,617
Thank you.

665
00:32:05,650 --> 00:32:06,885
You haven't completed
the challenge yet.

666
00:32:06,918 --> 00:32:09,621
We cooked a meal together,
we're eating together.

667
00:32:10,789 --> 00:32:11,856
Alright, we have to finish it.

668
00:32:11,890 --> 00:32:12,957
Everybody shovel it in.

669
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:17,762
[Rachel] Kasey, slow
down, you're gonna choke.

670
00:32:17,796 --> 00:32:19,231
What, why would you say that?

671
00:32:19,265 --> 00:32:21,233
Just like when she was little.

672
00:32:21,267 --> 00:32:22,934
Okay, really, eat.

673
00:32:22,967 --> 00:32:24,669
Or it's the only way
we're gonna get this clue.

674
00:32:24,702 --> 00:32:25,770
I'm with Kasey.

675
00:32:25,804 --> 00:32:28,106
Let's hurry up, I have to
get to work in the morning.

676
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:30,075
How long is this
going to take?

677
00:32:30,108 --> 00:32:32,144
Well, it depends on you.

678
00:32:32,178 --> 00:32:34,846
What you do and how you do it.

679
00:32:34,879 --> 00:32:38,184
Do you remember that crazy
Easter when we were kids?

680
00:32:38,217 --> 00:32:41,119
When did you finally
find your basket, Kasey?

681
00:32:41,153 --> 00:32:42,087
Days.

682
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:42,921

683
00:32:42,954 --> 00:32:43,755

685
00:32:44,823 --> 00:32:45,690
And she cried so much.

686
00:32:46,392 --> 00:32:47,659
[laughs]

687
00:32:47,692 --> 00:32:48,793
I wasn't that bad, you guys.

688
00:32:48,827 --> 00:32:50,895
Oh my gosh, you were.

689
00:32:50,929 --> 00:32:53,199
I remember by the third day,

690
00:32:53,232 --> 00:32:56,335
you laid in the middle of
the kitchen floor bawling.

691
00:32:56,368 --> 00:32:57,769
We had searched and searched

692
00:32:57,802 --> 00:32:59,871
and we couldn't
figure out the clue,

693
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:03,842
and Mom kept saying, "You're
hot, girls, you're so hot."

694
00:33:03,875 --> 00:33:07,179
We looked in the fridge and
we opened every cabinet.

695
00:33:08,414 --> 00:33:10,682
And then from your
spot on the floor

696
00:33:10,715 --> 00:33:13,852
in your pool of
tears, you looked up.

697
00:33:14,853 --> 00:33:18,823
It was duct taped to the
bottom of the dining room table.

698
00:33:18,857 --> 00:33:20,226
[all chuckling]

699
00:33:20,259 --> 00:33:22,861
I was so exhausted and
frustrated, I just laid there.

700
00:33:24,130 --> 00:33:27,333
While we un-taped it
and laid it next to you.

701
00:33:30,136 --> 00:33:30,969
You remember.

702
00:33:32,371 --> 00:33:34,140
Yeah, I remember you
guys standing around

703
00:33:34,173 --> 00:33:35,207
and laughing at me.

704
00:33:35,241 --> 00:33:37,709
No, we weren't
laughing at you.

705
00:33:37,742 --> 00:33:41,347
I laid there for a long
time rubbing your back.

706
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:42,881
I always took care of you.

707
00:33:44,082 --> 00:33:45,750
Mom just wanted us
to work together.

708
00:33:50,788 --> 00:33:53,892
[Sophia speaking Spanish]

709
00:33:53,925 --> 00:33:55,093
So what do we do now?

710
00:33:55,126 --> 00:33:57,263
Carrie, can you reread
the challenge card?

711
00:34:00,432 --> 00:34:03,668
"There is a time for
war and a time for peace."

712
00:34:05,870 --> 00:34:09,241
My rose today is reminiscing

713
00:34:09,275 --> 00:34:10,909
with you all about
our childhood.

714
00:34:13,379 --> 00:34:16,748
My rose is that for the
first time in a long time,

715
00:34:16,781 --> 00:34:18,883
we cooked a meal
together as a family.

716
00:34:19,918 --> 00:34:22,954
It's been really nice to have
y'all back under this roof.

717
00:34:22,987 --> 00:34:25,191
My rose and my thorn
are the same thing.

718
00:34:25,224 --> 00:34:28,059
We buried our mother, but
it brought us together.

719
00:34:30,429 --> 00:34:33,097
I like this roses
and thorns thing.

720
00:34:33,132 --> 00:34:35,867
You each say something good
and bad about your day.

721
00:34:36,968 --> 00:34:39,438
Kasey, you still have
to say something.

722
00:34:44,909 --> 00:34:45,944
My thorn

723
00:34:46,844 --> 00:34:48,380
is that I handed my sister

724
00:34:48,414 --> 00:34:51,217
her career on the night
of my last concert.

725
00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:52,251
Are you kidding me, Kasey?

726
00:34:52,284 --> 00:34:53,385
That was a long time ago.

727
00:34:53,419 --> 00:34:56,288
She wouldn't be a TV star
if I hadn't been a rockstar.

728
00:34:56,322 --> 00:34:58,990
They have nothing
to do with each other.

729
00:34:59,824 --> 00:35:01,193
What?

730
00:35:01,227 --> 00:35:02,894
She'd been nothing without me.

731
00:35:02,927 --> 00:35:04,530
Cobra gave your
sister her fame.

732
00:35:04,563 --> 00:35:06,097
Cobra was my guitarist.

733
00:35:06,131 --> 00:35:09,368
Cobra fell off your stage
and became her patient.

734
00:35:09,401 --> 00:35:11,936
Back up, can somebody
fill me in on this story?

735
00:35:11,970 --> 00:35:14,440
I am so sick of this story.

736
00:35:14,473 --> 00:35:16,475
Kasey was rocking
out on a stage

737
00:35:16,508 --> 00:35:18,977
and the audience started
getting a little rowdy.

738
00:35:19,010 --> 00:35:21,012
Now, her lead guitarist, Cobra,

739
00:35:21,045 --> 00:35:24,149
he got pulled into a mosh pit
by a sea of screaming women.

740
00:35:24,183 --> 00:35:27,219
Now, he hit the ground hard
and was knocked unconscious.

741
00:35:27,253 --> 00:35:29,988
Next thing you know, a beautiful
blond comes running out

742
00:35:30,021 --> 00:35:33,791
on the stage from the wings.

743
00:35:33,825 --> 00:35:36,928
She literally dove
into the audience,

744
00:35:36,961 --> 00:35:39,331
pulled Cobra back onto stage,

745
00:35:39,365 --> 00:35:41,333
resuscitated him,
and saved his life.

746
00:35:44,436 --> 00:35:46,938
He broke his hand in
seven different places.

747
00:35:47,939 --> 00:35:51,075
He was my other half
and they canceled my tour.

748
00:35:51,109 --> 00:35:54,112
How was that her fault,
she saved a man's life.

749
00:35:54,146 --> 00:35:56,348
Because he wanted to
come back on tour with me,

750
00:35:56,382 --> 00:36:00,252
and she told them not to,
and she recommended a surgery

751
00:36:00,286 --> 00:36:02,454
that would take a
year of recovery.

752
00:36:02,488 --> 00:36:04,189
She made the
right call, Kasey.

753
00:36:04,223 --> 00:36:06,024
He's still playing to this day.

754
00:36:06,057 --> 00:36:08,460
Yeah, well, and I'm not.

755
00:36:08,494 --> 00:36:11,563
[gentle tense music]

756
00:36:15,334 --> 00:36:16,901
Can we just move on?

757
00:36:16,934 --> 00:36:18,304
[chuckles]

758
00:36:18,337 --> 00:36:21,873
Well, congratulations,
you've completed the challenge.

759
00:36:21,906 --> 00:36:26,378
Now, I will read the clue,
but first you each get

760
00:36:26,412 --> 00:36:28,580
to select an item from
this hat that no matter

761
00:36:28,614 --> 00:36:30,948
who gets the deed,
you get to keep.

762
00:36:30,982 --> 00:36:33,985
Go ahead, help yourself.

763
00:36:34,018 --> 00:36:37,256
[gentle peaceful music]

764
00:36:39,458 --> 00:36:42,594
I get the big pizza oven.

765
00:36:42,628 --> 00:36:43,995
Wait a second, I
think I paid for that.

766
00:36:44,028 --> 00:36:46,097
I get the cuckoo clock.

767
00:36:46,131 --> 00:36:48,600
Awesome, most
annoying chimes ever.

768
00:36:48,634 --> 00:36:51,069
Just don't set it to
every hour like Mom did.

769
00:36:52,571 --> 00:36:53,971
[Emily] What'd you get?

770
00:36:54,906 --> 00:36:57,075
Oh, I get Mom and
Dad's old station wagon.

771
00:36:57,975 --> 00:36:59,077
That's mine.

772
00:36:59,110 --> 00:37:01,513
[all laughing]

773
00:37:04,516 --> 00:37:07,553
Great, Mom's china set.

774
00:37:07,586 --> 00:37:09,154
I always wanted Mom's china.

775
00:37:09,188 --> 00:37:10,622
Then you can buy it off me.

776
00:37:13,124 --> 00:37:15,361
Okay, I will read the clue.

777
00:37:16,595 --> 00:37:19,063
Don't store up
treasures here on earth

778
00:37:19,097 --> 00:37:22,066
where moths eat them
and rust destroys them

779
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:24,303
and where thieves
break in and steal.

780
00:37:24,336 --> 00:37:27,939
Look to your childhood hiding
spot for your next challenge.

781
00:37:30,442 --> 00:37:33,010
I don't think I had a
hiding spot, my diary?

782
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:36,914
I had things at
my friend's house.

783
00:37:36,948 --> 00:37:39,485
I had a lock box, but I
don't think Mom had the key.

784
00:37:39,518 --> 00:37:41,986
Maybe she found the key.

785
00:37:42,019 --> 00:37:44,989
[bright upbeat music]

786
00:37:47,024 --> 00:37:47,959
It is a delicious meal.

787
00:37:47,992 --> 00:37:48,993
Yeah.

788
00:37:49,026 --> 00:37:51,062
[chuckles]

789
00:37:51,095 --> 00:37:56,100
[mourning dove hooting]

790
00:37:58,069 --> 00:38:01,240
[gentle upbeat music]

791
00:38:31,637 --> 00:38:36,642
[paper rustling]

792
00:38:44,316 --> 00:38:49,188
Hey, Mom, did you really
ruin Aunt Kasey's career?

793
00:38:49,221 --> 00:38:50,422
Of course I didn't.

794
00:38:51,390 --> 00:38:53,090
Then why does she blame you?

795
00:38:54,193 --> 00:38:55,360
[sighs]

796
00:38:55,394 --> 00:38:57,061
Because Aunt Kasey
has a hard time

797
00:38:57,094 --> 00:38:59,598
taking responsibility
for herself.

798
00:38:59,631 --> 00:39:03,067
Okay, then why did
she stop making music?

799
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:04,203
You'll have to ask her.

800
00:39:05,170 --> 00:39:08,039
Your Aunt Kasey can make
music with or without

801
00:39:08,072 --> 00:39:11,210
a stadium full of people
just like I can help people

802
00:39:11,243 --> 00:39:12,544
whether I'm on TV or not.

803
00:39:14,179 --> 00:39:15,180
Yeah.

804
00:39:15,214 --> 00:39:17,516
[gentle tense music]

805
00:39:17,549 --> 00:39:19,384
[Kasey] I found 'em!

806
00:39:22,254 --> 00:39:24,223
Yes, there you go.

807
00:39:24,256 --> 00:39:27,226
[gentle upbeat music]

808
00:39:29,728 --> 00:39:30,662
[gasps]

809
00:39:30,696 --> 00:39:32,063
Oh!

810
00:39:32,096 --> 00:39:33,030
I thought I cut the
head off that doll

811
00:39:33,064 --> 00:39:34,098
and flushed it down the toilet.

812
00:39:34,132 --> 00:39:36,134
No, that was Malibu Barbie.

813
00:39:37,569 --> 00:39:39,438
This Barbie I made because
there was no such thing

814
00:39:39,471 --> 00:39:41,105
as Dr. Barbie when I was a kid.

815
00:39:44,108 --> 00:39:47,078
Mom and Dad said there
was nothing we couldn't do.

816
00:39:47,111 --> 00:39:50,114
Hey, who wants to hear my
speech for class president?

817
00:39:50,148 --> 00:39:51,216
[All] No.

818
00:39:51,250 --> 00:39:53,285
[chuckles]

819
00:39:53,318 --> 00:39:55,153
But look at this.

820
00:39:55,187 --> 00:39:59,224
Oh, Carrie, that was my
favorite restaurant growing up.

821
00:39:59,258 --> 00:40:01,293
I can't believe y'all
actually ate my mud pie.

822
00:40:01,326 --> 00:40:02,361
[all laughing]

823
00:40:02,394 --> 00:40:04,196
We spit it out.

824
00:40:04,229 --> 00:40:07,499
Wow, that was fast, you
guys are good at this game.

825
00:40:07,533 --> 00:40:09,268
You ready for your
next challenge?

826
00:40:09,301 --> 00:40:10,101
[sighs]

827
00:40:10,135 --> 00:40:11,403
I'm exhausted.

828
00:40:11,436 --> 00:40:13,539
Alright, challenge number two.

829
00:40:13,572 --> 00:40:17,142
And Jesus said, "Let
the children come to me.

830
00:40:17,175 --> 00:40:20,111
Don't stop them, for the kingdom
of heaven belongs to those

831
00:40:20,145 --> 00:40:24,149
who are like these
children," Matthew 19:14.

832
00:40:24,182 --> 00:40:27,719
Remember your youth by playing
a game of Capture the Flag.

833
00:40:27,753 --> 00:40:29,288
[Carrie and Kasey sighing]

834
00:40:29,321 --> 00:40:30,422
I'm getting too old for this.

835
00:40:30,455 --> 00:40:32,457
Yeah, and it's dark outside.

836
00:40:32,491 --> 00:40:33,525
What?

837
00:40:33,559 --> 00:40:35,627
No, don't be wimps, we got this.

838
00:40:35,661 --> 00:40:39,197
It's been a long
day, let's make a rule.

839
00:40:39,231 --> 00:40:42,434
We'll break from
10:00 p.m to 8:00 a.m.

840
00:40:42,467 --> 00:40:43,702
8:00 a.m?

841
00:40:43,735 --> 00:40:45,337
I don't get up before 10:00.

842
00:40:45,370 --> 00:40:47,372
Maybe, that's why
you're unemployed.

843
00:40:47,406 --> 00:40:49,174
[laughing]

844
00:40:49,207 --> 00:40:51,176
Great, I'll see you at 8:00.

845
00:40:51,209 --> 00:40:53,245
Oh, they'll get
up for that money.

846
00:40:53,278 --> 00:40:56,348
[gentle tense music]

847
00:41:00,586 --> 00:41:03,120
[Mom] Hello, Kasey,
it's your mother.

848
00:41:03,155 --> 00:41:04,890
I have something to read to you.

849
00:41:04,923 --> 00:41:07,492
There once was a farmer
who planted seeds.

850
00:41:07,526 --> 00:41:11,229
Some of the seeds fell on
a path, the birds ate them.

851
00:41:11,263 --> 00:41:12,864
These seeds are
like those who hear

852
00:41:12,898 --> 00:41:14,199
- the message of the kingdom...
- Hey.

853
00:41:14,232 --> 00:41:16,501
- "And don't understand."
- Hi.

854
00:41:16,535 --> 00:41:19,237
[Emily sighs]

855
00:41:25,177 --> 00:41:30,148
Oh, you don't want this tape?

856
00:41:31,850 --> 00:41:35,821
It's just dumb old songs from
when I was young and stupid.

857
00:41:35,854 --> 00:41:38,323
Well, I bet
they're really good.

858
00:41:38,357 --> 00:41:39,625
You know, I'm kind of busy.

859
00:41:41,526 --> 00:41:42,828
Okay, well, can I borrow it?

860
00:41:42,861 --> 00:41:44,262
Yeah, you can have it.

861
00:41:46,398 --> 00:41:47,733
Oh, can I use this?

862
00:41:49,368 --> 00:41:50,202
Go for it.

863
00:41:58,276 --> 00:42:01,580
You know, my mom
gave me your album.

864
00:42:01,613 --> 00:42:02,447
I love your music.

865
00:42:02,481 --> 00:42:03,281
[laughs]

866
00:42:03,315 --> 00:42:04,549
Really?

867
00:42:04,583 --> 00:42:07,786
Yeah, oh, "Lives of
Our Youth" is the best.

868
00:42:07,819 --> 00:42:11,323
I think there's an early
version of that on the B side.

869
00:42:11,356 --> 00:42:12,557
Hit play.

870
00:42:12,591 --> 00:42:17,562
This is a new one,
it's called "My Stars."

871
00:42:18,530 --> 00:42:19,665
I changed the title when
I put it on my album.

♪ Let down your guard, I'll be ♪

873

like the adoring fans

00:42:41,853 --> 00:42:44,923
who want your autograph
and your photo.

881
00:42:44,956 --> 00:42:46,925
But you just
said it was empty.

882
00:42:46,958 --> 00:42:49,961
It is, but I like to be liked.

883
00:42:51,363 --> 00:42:52,397
I like you, Aunt Kasey.

884
00:42:54,299 --> 00:42:55,333
Really?

885
00:42:57,669 --> 00:42:59,838
Would you do something for me?

886
00:42:59,871 --> 00:43:03,842
I say, you and I team
up to find the deed,

887
00:43:03,875 --> 00:43:07,212
like a aunt and niece
bonding kind of thing.

888
00:43:08,013 --> 00:43:08,947
Really?

889
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:11,249
And then, if we find the deed,

890
00:43:11,283 --> 00:43:13,618
I can give you 10%
of the money I get.

891
00:43:13,652 --> 00:43:15,887
Oh, I would do it
just to be with you.

892
00:43:15,921 --> 00:43:18,790
Perfect, then
I'll give you 5%.

893
00:43:18,824 --> 00:43:22,327
Okay, you take the first
shift tomorrow at 8:00 a.m.

894
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:24,463
[Emily] Okay,
I'll go tell my mom.

895
00:43:24,496 --> 00:43:28,400
Unless, we find it tonight.

896
00:43:29,401 --> 00:43:31,470
Isn't that against the rules?

897
00:43:31,503 --> 00:43:35,373
Cool kids like us
don't play by the rules.

898
00:43:35,407 --> 00:43:37,509
I mean, you wanna be
just like me, right?

899
00:43:38,410 --> 00:43:39,845
[laughs]

900
00:43:39,878 --> 00:43:42,247
Then go downstairs and
see if the coast is clear.

901
00:43:42,914 --> 00:43:47,919
[gentle tense music]

902
00:44:46,711 --> 00:44:47,646
[gasps]

903
00:44:47,679 --> 00:44:48,814
- I knew it!
- Shh.

904
00:44:48,847 --> 00:44:49,948
I knew I was
gonna find you here!

905
00:44:49,981 --> 00:44:50,949
What are you doing?

906
00:44:50,982 --> 00:44:52,050
What are you doing here?

907
00:44:52,083 --> 00:44:52,884
I'm looking for the deed.

908
00:44:52,918 --> 00:44:54,553
Did you find it?

909
00:44:54,586 --> 00:44:56,421
You think I would
sneak around if I did?

910
00:44:56,454 --> 00:44:58,523
[laughs]

911
00:44:59,891 --> 00:45:01,726
[gentle upbeat music]

912
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:03,129
Coast is clear.

913
00:45:03,162 --> 00:45:04,462
Perfect.

914
00:45:04,496 --> 00:45:06,031
I always envisioned
I would come back

915
00:45:06,064 --> 00:45:07,399
to live in this house someday.

916
00:45:07,432 --> 00:45:09,634
[cicadas buzzing]

917
00:45:09,668 --> 00:45:11,503
You know, I've been thinking.

918
00:45:13,071 --> 00:45:16,474
I think I should come home
and be mayor of this town.

919
00:45:16,508 --> 00:45:18,144
Thought you always
wanted to be president.

920
00:45:18,177 --> 00:45:20,078
And that comes with a house.

921
00:45:20,111 --> 00:45:24,015
Yeah, but I think I'm better
at town flipping, actually.

922
00:45:25,050 --> 00:45:25,951
It's my specialty.

923
00:45:27,519 --> 00:45:28,353
Town flipping?

924
00:45:29,521 --> 00:45:32,490
Yeah, you know, it's
like house flipping.

925
00:45:32,524 --> 00:45:36,094
People buy houses, they fix
them up, they sell them.

926
00:45:36,127 --> 00:45:37,495
That's what I'm
gonna do with towns.

927
00:45:37,529 --> 00:45:38,530
[chuckles]

928
00:45:38,563 --> 00:45:39,998
Okay.

929
00:45:40,031 --> 00:45:40,932
I'm assuming if
y'all found it,

930
00:45:40,966 --> 00:45:43,568
you wouldn't be sitting here.

931
00:45:43,602 --> 00:45:44,402
No.

932
00:45:44,436 --> 00:45:45,503
[Rachel laughs]

933
00:45:45,537 --> 00:45:48,506
[upbeat lively music]

934
00:45:55,547 --> 00:45:56,715
[vase clangs]

935
00:45:56,748 --> 00:45:59,851
Shh, you're gonna
wake someone up.

936
00:45:59,885 --> 00:46:00,685
I'm sorry.

937
00:46:00,719 --> 00:46:03,588
[laughs]

938
00:46:06,658 --> 00:46:08,026
Well, I don't want
to flip this house.

939
00:46:08,059 --> 00:46:09,394
I want to live in it.

940
00:46:10,595 --> 00:46:12,030
If Kasey finds the
deed before we do,

941
00:46:12,063 --> 00:46:14,432
that's the first thing
she'll do, she'll sell it.

942
00:46:14,466 --> 00:46:15,800
That's the second
thing she'll do.

943
00:46:15,834 --> 00:46:18,637
The first thing she'll
do is lord it over us.

944
00:46:18,670 --> 00:46:20,672
I might be ready to be
done with this place.

945
00:46:20,705 --> 00:46:23,142
This house holds
family memories!

946
00:46:23,175 --> 00:46:25,577
All my memories are of
caring for our dying parents.

947
00:46:25,610 --> 00:46:27,146
You didn't have to do that!

948
00:46:27,179 --> 00:46:29,547
We coulda hired
someone to help her.

949
00:46:29,581 --> 00:46:31,049
That was your choice.

950
00:46:31,082 --> 00:46:34,753
It didn't feel like
a choice, y'all left.

951
00:46:35,887 --> 00:46:37,055
Besides, I wasn't
gonna hire a stranger

952
00:46:37,088 --> 00:46:38,590
to take care of my own mother.

953
00:46:38,623 --> 00:46:40,792
After dad died, I invited
her to come live with me.

954
00:46:40,825 --> 00:46:43,561
It had all of her
memories, it was her home.

955
00:46:43,595 --> 00:46:46,665
Well, this is also
why I want the house.

956
00:46:46,698 --> 00:46:50,035
Again, that was her choice,
and you chose to stay.

957
00:46:50,068 --> 00:46:52,604
I chose to put her
needs above my own.

958
00:46:52,637 --> 00:46:53,538
So what do you wanna do now?

959
00:46:53,571 --> 00:46:55,540
Open my own cafe.

960
00:46:55,573 --> 00:46:57,108
You should do that.

961
00:46:57,143 --> 00:46:58,476
That's why I want
my inheritance.

962
00:46:58,510 --> 00:46:59,511
Well, that's
exactly why we need

963
00:46:59,544 --> 00:47:01,479
to find the deed
before Kasey does.

964
00:47:05,083 --> 00:47:10,088
[gentle tense music]

965
00:47:13,292 --> 00:47:15,194
Wow, thanks so
much for inviting me

966
00:47:15,227 --> 00:47:16,561
to this little family meeting.

967
00:47:16,594 --> 00:47:18,997
Kasey, stop being so dramatic.

968
00:47:19,030 --> 00:47:21,700
Listen, guys, I have a new plan

969
00:47:21,733 --> 00:47:23,135
and I really need the house now.

970
00:47:23,169 --> 00:47:25,570
I'm gonna put this
town on the map.

971
00:47:25,603 --> 00:47:27,505
Yeah, well, I
really need the money.

972
00:47:28,506 --> 00:47:31,710
Kasey, money is not more
valuable than our family home.

973
00:47:31,743 --> 00:47:33,979
Yes, it is when you
really need the money.

974
00:47:34,012 --> 00:47:35,714
You have a townhouse
in New York City

975
00:47:35,747 --> 00:47:37,849
and a house in the Hamptons.

976
00:47:37,882 --> 00:47:40,685
Why do you need another house,
you're just being greedy.

977
00:47:41,886 --> 00:47:44,723
I'm with Kasey, I
could use the money.

978
00:47:44,756 --> 00:47:46,225
Thank you, okay.

979
00:47:46,258 --> 00:47:48,893
Hey, let's make a
pact, how about this?

980
00:47:48,927 --> 00:47:51,062
If one of us finds it,
we split it equally.

981
00:47:51,963 --> 00:47:52,764
I'll take it.

982
00:47:52,797 --> 00:47:53,698
Okay.

983
00:47:53,732 --> 00:47:54,766
Rachel.

984
00:47:54,799 --> 00:47:55,600
- Hmm?
- Help me be

985
00:47:55,633 --> 00:47:56,701
mayor of this town.

986
00:47:56,735 --> 00:47:57,702
Deal.

987
00:47:57,736 --> 00:47:58,670
Mayor?

988
00:47:58,703 --> 00:48:00,206
I'm gonna do something
good for my hometown.

989
00:48:00,239 --> 00:48:03,641
You're coming home now,
now that mom has died?

990
00:48:03,675 --> 00:48:05,277
That's great,
George, just great.

991
00:48:05,311 --> 00:48:07,078
It was your choice to stay.

992
00:48:07,112 --> 00:48:08,314
I still live here!

993
00:48:08,347 --> 00:48:09,647
Maybe I'll let you
have the guest house.

994
00:48:09,681 --> 00:48:13,685
[laughing]

995
00:48:13,718 --> 00:48:16,621
[Carrie sighs]

996
00:48:16,654 --> 00:48:17,622
Hey, Kasey?

997
00:48:17,655 --> 00:48:18,424
Yeah?

998
00:48:18,457 --> 00:48:20,159
Just seeing if
you have that money

999
00:48:20,192 --> 00:48:21,760
that you borrowed from me?

1000
00:48:21,793 --> 00:48:23,995
Yes, yeah, I'm working on it.

1001
00:48:24,029 --> 00:48:25,630
- Sorry.
- Okay, cool.

1002
00:48:25,663 --> 00:48:27,199
No, if we find the deed,
maybe you can just pay me back

1003
00:48:27,233 --> 00:48:28,633
from your share of
the inheritance.

1004
00:48:28,666 --> 00:48:30,668
Yeah, great, goodnight, sis.

1005
00:48:30,702 --> 00:48:33,239
Goodnight, hey,
let's find this deed.

1006
00:48:34,140 --> 00:48:35,141
Yes.

1007
00:48:35,174 --> 00:48:38,543
[gentle upbeat music]

1008
00:48:50,822 --> 00:48:53,558
Okay.

1009
00:48:57,662 --> 00:48:59,631
What am I gonna
do without you?

1010
00:48:59,664 --> 00:49:02,100
Rach, I didn't plan on
one your mom's adventures.

1011
00:49:03,802 --> 00:49:05,804
Although I should've
seen it coming.

1012
00:49:06,704 --> 00:49:08,174
We're almost done.

1013
00:49:08,207 --> 00:49:10,942
Babe, come on,
this could take days.

1014
00:49:10,975 --> 00:49:11,810
I know.

1015
00:49:20,785 --> 00:49:22,620
Thanks for sticking up for me.

1016
00:49:22,654 --> 00:49:25,690
I can't believe she still goes
on and on about that concert.

1017
00:49:27,393 --> 00:49:30,662
As much as I like being
your knight in shining armor,

1018
00:49:30,695 --> 00:49:32,398
I think it's time
to settle that feud.

1019
00:49:32,431 --> 00:49:34,833
I don't know how to.

1020
00:49:34,866 --> 00:49:36,067
Be the bigger person.

1021
00:49:37,403 --> 00:49:39,804
Maybe, you suck it up
and say you're sorry.

1022
00:49:39,838 --> 00:49:41,940
Not only that, even if
it wasn't your fault,

1023
00:49:41,973 --> 00:49:45,311
you made a call and it
hurt your sister, you know?

1024
00:49:45,344 --> 00:49:48,012
And if you hadn't
become Cobra's doctor,

1025
00:49:48,046 --> 00:49:50,782
you wouldn't have
become Dr. Rachel,

1026
00:49:50,815 --> 00:49:53,185
and the world needs you.

1027
00:49:53,219 --> 00:49:54,853
So I should apologize.

1028
00:49:54,886 --> 00:49:57,156
If you want a relationship
with your sister.

1029
00:49:57,189 --> 00:49:58,390
Might loosen things up.

1030
00:49:59,258 --> 00:50:00,825
It might solve the problem.

1031
00:50:00,859 --> 00:50:02,760
She seems to be going through
a rough time right now.

1032
00:50:02,794 --> 00:50:03,862
Just have some compassion.

1033
00:50:03,895 --> 00:50:07,233
I feel like she's always
going through a rough time.

1034
00:50:07,266 --> 00:50:10,902
This would be so much easier
if Kasey wasn't so Kasey.

1035
00:50:13,738 --> 00:50:15,241
[both chuckling]

1036
00:50:15,274 --> 00:50:17,243
You can't expect somebody
to be something they're not.

1037
00:50:18,410 --> 00:50:20,812
We need to love them
for who they are.

1038
00:50:20,845 --> 00:50:23,781
Alright, I'll see
you and Emily soon.

1039
00:50:24,782 --> 00:50:26,385
Okay, try not to get hurt
looking for that deed.

1040
00:50:26,418 --> 00:50:28,920
[laughs]

1041
00:50:28,953 --> 00:50:31,257
Rachel, give her a chance, okay?

1042
00:50:33,459 --> 00:50:35,126
Sure, she's a little curmudgeon.

1043
00:50:35,161 --> 00:50:37,762
I know, but she's
my little curmudgeon.

1044
00:50:37,795 --> 00:50:40,266
Yeah, that's my
girl, love you, baby.

1045
00:50:40,299 --> 00:50:42,734
Love you, be safe.

1046
00:50:42,767 --> 00:50:45,304
[engine roaring]

1047
00:50:53,011 --> 00:50:56,148
[gentle upbeat music]

1048
00:51:02,188 --> 00:51:04,156
[sighs]

1049
00:51:05,191 --> 00:51:07,825
[clock ticking]

1050
00:51:08,793 --> 00:51:11,729
[cuckoo chiming]

1051
00:51:14,300 --> 00:51:15,467
[George] What are you doing?

1052
00:51:15,501 --> 00:51:16,801
- I'm stretching.
- Get focused.

1053
00:51:16,834 --> 00:51:18,903
I am, it's yoga.

1054
00:51:18,937 --> 00:51:20,905
You think this is the one

bury her and get your money

as threatening.

[grunts]

1402
01:09:12,910 --> 01:09:14,012
It's choked.

1403
01:09:14,045 --> 01:09:15,147
It's gonna take awhile.

1404
01:09:15,180 --> 01:09:17,048
Yeah, choked with memories.

1405
01:09:22,321 --> 01:09:23,788
Let's do this right?

1406
01:09:24,456 --> 01:09:25,624
I am doing it right.

1407
01:09:25,658 --> 01:09:28,793
I put the seeds in the garden
and I covered them with dirt.

1408
01:09:32,298 --> 01:09:33,565
You know, this is nice.

1409
01:09:34,932 --> 01:09:36,901
What, arguing
about whether seeds

1410
01:09:36,934 --> 01:09:39,937
want to be planted with
doctor-like precision or not?

1411
01:09:39,971 --> 01:09:41,039
Being together.

1412
01:09:43,074 --> 01:09:45,444
I've missed you.

1413
01:09:45,477 --> 01:09:48,247
I know, I've missed me too.

1414
01:09:48,280 --> 01:09:49,947
I'm serious.

1415
01:09:49,981 --> 01:09:50,948
We were so close.

1416
01:09:52,518 --> 01:09:53,918
But you don't know what it
feels like to love something

1417
01:09:53,951 --> 01:09:56,020
so much and you loose it.

1418
01:09:56,954 --> 01:09:57,989
I do.

1419
01:09:59,891 --> 01:10:02,093
I had no idea that my decisions

1420
01:10:02,126 --> 01:10:04,363
would have such an
impact on your career.

1421
01:10:05,297 --> 01:10:08,600
I know, that's what you do.

1422
01:10:08,634 --> 01:10:10,034
Ouch!

1423
01:10:10,068 --> 01:10:12,036
No, no, I meant
helping people.

1424
01:10:12,937 --> 01:10:16,208
But mom said about
using our gifts for God

1425
01:10:16,241 --> 01:10:18,310
that's what you did,
you healed someone.

1426
01:10:21,045 --> 01:10:25,484
Thank you for saying that.

1427
01:10:25,517 --> 01:10:29,388
You used your gifts for good,
and I used mine for myself.

1428
01:10:31,022 --> 01:10:34,058
Hey, did mom leave you a weird
message on your voicemail?

1429
01:10:35,561 --> 01:10:38,430
I missed this call from her
just before she passed and...

1430
01:10:39,565 --> 01:10:41,899
And I didn't call her
back, you know me.

1431
01:10:43,302 --> 01:10:44,869
I meant to, but then...

1432
01:10:48,374 --> 01:10:51,109
Anyway, I've listened to it
about a hundred times, you know,

1433
01:10:51,143 --> 01:10:52,944
just to hear her voice again.

1434
01:10:52,977 --> 01:10:54,513
What did it say?

1435
01:10:54,546 --> 01:10:58,916
It was a poem verse
thing about gardening.

1436
01:11:02,086 --> 01:11:05,457
I think I'm just hurt that
she would call and use

1437
01:11:05,491 --> 01:11:09,894
a Bible verse of all things
for her last words to me.

1438
01:11:11,630 --> 01:11:13,499
I didn't get that message.

1439
01:11:13,532 --> 01:11:14,966
Me either.

1440
01:11:14,999 --> 01:11:15,900
The only time mom
ever gave me a ring,

1441
01:11:15,933 --> 01:11:18,470
just when she wanted
me to bring her dinner.

1442
01:11:18,504 --> 01:11:20,339
[chuckles]

1443
01:11:20,372 --> 01:11:22,940
I'm sure she meant
something important by that.

1444
01:11:25,109 --> 01:11:27,513
[upbeat music]

1445
01:11:36,288 --> 01:11:37,189

01:11:37,222 --> 01:11:39,391
[laughing]

1447
01:11:39,425 --> 01:11:42,093
Okay, we are done.

1448
01:11:42,126 --> 01:11:44,463
Oh, I'll be right with you,
I'm almost finished here.

1449
01:11:44,496 --> 01:11:45,697
You're welcome
to give me the book

1450
01:11:45,731 --> 01:11:46,964
and I could read the clues.

1451
01:11:46,998 --> 01:11:48,133
Oh, that's my job.

1452
01:11:48,167 --> 01:11:50,067
Well, then read it already.

1453
01:11:50,101 --> 01:11:51,670
I'm sorry, you are incorrect.

1454
01:11:53,138 --> 01:11:54,306
- What?!
- Are we sure

1455
01:11:54,339 --> 01:11:56,141
this is where we were
supposed to plant.

1456
01:11:56,175 --> 01:11:57,509
Well, it could be anywhere.

1457
01:11:57,543 --> 01:11:59,445
There's gotta be
more to the clue.

1458
01:11:59,478 --> 01:12:02,980
Hey, this, this is a parable
and illustration, you know?

1459
01:12:03,014 --> 01:12:04,416
So maybe it's not literal.

1460
01:12:04,450 --> 01:12:05,983
Like we're not supposed
to plant the seeds?

1461
01:12:06,017 --> 01:12:07,084
These are mustard seeds.

1462
01:12:08,620 --> 01:12:10,155
How do you know?

1463
01:12:10,189 --> 01:12:13,292
Because my youth leader
passed them out recently,

1464
01:12:13,325 --> 01:12:15,327
Bible study as an example.

1465
01:12:15,360 --> 01:12:17,529
There's so small.

1466
01:12:17,563 --> 01:12:20,499
- kingdom of heaven...
- Is like a grain

1467
01:12:20,532 --> 01:12:24,136
of mustard seed, which a man
took and put in his own garden.

1468
01:12:25,304 --> 01:12:26,505
And with the faith
of a mustard seed,

1469
01:12:26,538 --> 01:12:28,072
- you can...
- Tell them mountain to move

1470
01:12:28,105 --> 01:12:29,308
and it will move.

1471
01:12:29,341 --> 01:12:31,210
Okay, let's stay on track.

1472
01:12:31,243 --> 01:12:34,613
We're talking about gardens,
not mountains, sorry.

1473
01:12:35,781 --> 01:12:37,216
Did we ever have our
own gardens here?

1474
01:12:37,249 --> 01:12:39,384
No, they were always Mom's.

1475
01:12:39,418 --> 01:12:42,187
You know, the end of
that versus the best.

1476
01:12:42,221 --> 01:12:44,523
Your soul shall be like
a well-watered garden.

1477
01:12:48,125 --> 01:12:49,161
Oh, it's us.

1478
01:12:50,061 --> 01:12:52,431
The faith of the mustard
seed is inside us.

1479
01:12:52,464 --> 01:12:53,665
What?

1480
01:12:53,699 --> 01:12:55,367
We're supposed
to eat the seeds.

1481
01:12:55,400 --> 01:12:58,237
It's a metaphor for God
living in our hearts.

1482
01:12:58,270 --> 01:12:59,404
Yes.

1483
01:12:59,438 --> 01:13:00,706
If you're wrong, we're done.

1484
01:13:00,739 --> 01:13:02,674
We won't be able to
get the seeds back.

1485
01:13:02,708 --> 01:13:03,542
I'm certain.

1486
01:13:06,578 --> 01:13:07,412

know if I'm right.

the truck tyre.

1498
01:13:36,308 --> 01:13:37,576

three is in four parts.

inside, in between?

1513

Wait guys, is it,
read the inscription?

1514
01:14:24,323 --> 01:14:25,390
Oh, that's right!

1515
01:14:25,424 --> 01:14:27,159
Read the inscription!

1516
01:14:28,427 --> 01:14:30,896
Which inscription,
mom loved inscriptions.

1517
01:14:30,929 --> 01:14:33,532
Remember the inscription
we put on the gazebo

1518
01:14:33,565 --> 01:14:35,734
for mom and dad's 50th
wedding anniversary.

1519
01:14:35,767 --> 01:14:38,203
Well, I guess it's somewhere,
what did you guys put on it?

1520
01:14:38,236 --> 01:14:39,771
There's only one
way to find out.

1521

Come on.

It's gotta be here.

What is Mr. Shephard doing?

1529
01:14:57,522 --> 01:15:00,759
Man, Mom must have paid
him a lot to do all this.

1530
01:15:00,792 --> 01:15:02,928
It's like he's enjoying this.

1531

Were they close?

a hard time figuring out

who got what, boy, was I wrong.

01:15:10,602 --> 01:15:12,337
We will find anything?

1536

This doesn't seem right.

1537

It's too random.

hanging by the lake.

and a time to dance."

know what that means.

in the wrong place again.

Give me the cards,

I know this property
backwards and forwards.

1553

I know it too.

1554

Not like I do, give it to me.

- Give it.

Why did you do that?!

1561
01:16:16,368 --> 01:16:17,502
I didn't mean to,
it was an accident.

1562
01:16:17,536 --> 01:16:19,271
You ruined them.

1563
01:16:19,304 --> 01:16:21,473
I spotted something just
before you jumped on my back.

1564
01:16:21,506 --> 01:16:23,942
You ruined them, why don't
you just give them to me?

1565
01:16:23,975 --> 01:16:25,377
I could find the
right inscription.

1566
01:16:25,410 --> 01:16:26,244
Oh, you could've
figured it out.

1567

Why don't you solve
it right away then.

1568
01:16:27,679 --> 01:16:29,915
They shouldn't have
to solve anything.

I already paid my
dues with mom and dad.

1570

I should have my choice
of the inheritance.

here taking care of them.

And now all of you just get
to saunter back into my life.

And so you want things, after
