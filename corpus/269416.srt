1
00:00:18,345 --> 00:00:20,836
On the freeways it's looking
good! No major traf...

2
00:00:21,081 --> 00:00:24,209
BACKFIELD IN MOTION

3
00:00:31,891 --> 00:00:33,688
You touch it again and
you lose the finger.

4
00:00:48,908 --> 00:00:50,307
It's not too late to turn back.

5
00:00:50,643 --> 00:00:51,337
Forget it.

6
00:01:19,706 --> 00:01:23,107
God. I'm going to be wearing
overalls and picking my teeth

7
00:01:23,943 --> 00:01:24,637
with straw.

8
00:01:28,047 --> 00:01:29,639
Hey<i>, </i> I've seen Hee-Haw.

9
00:01:30,183 --> 00:01:32,378
And now you're gonna live it.

10
00:01:39,926 --> 00:01:41,018
Hee-Haw.

11
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:05,783
So honey<i>, </i>
where do you think our house is?

12
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:06,676
Here! Here it is!

13
00:02:30,176 --> 00:02:36,979
AHHHHHHHHH!

14
00:02:37,383 --> 00:02:38,315
I knew you'd like it.

15
00:02:41,221 --> 00:02:43,746
Dish patrol<i>, </i> they're here.
Just showed up in some old car.

16
00:02:44,624 --> 00:02:46,023
Honey<i>, </i> you should see
what's she's wearing.

17
00:02:46,559 --> 00:02:48,186
Isn't it exciting.
Our little community

18
00:02:48,528 --> 00:02:49,460
is growing every day.

19
00:02:49,696 --> 00:02:50,424
Think she's nice?

20
00:02:50,864 --> 00:02:51,262
Are you going over?

21
00:02:51,798 --> 00:02:52,890
Are you kidding?
I've been cooking all day.

22
00:02:53,266 --> 00:02:54,028
What are you bringing?

23
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:54,889
What do you think?

24
00:03:01,774 --> 00:03:03,901
Are you moving in?

25
00:03:04,744 --> 00:03:06,006
Ahhhh<i>, </i> yeah.

26
00:03:07,046 --> 00:03:07,876
I live up the street.

27
00:03:10,116 --> 00:03:11,413
Great. Well<i>, </i> I'm kinda busy so...

28
00:03:11,951 --> 00:03:13,976
Look. This wasn't my idea<i>, </i>
alright. You know<i>, </i>

29
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:18,051
my mother sent me down here and
stuff like that. Joe Dooley.

30
00:03:19,926 --> 00:03:20,722
Tim Seaver.

31
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:21,785
You play football?

32
00:03:22,395 --> 00:03:24,192
I haven't had much time lately.
Why?

33
00:03:24,497 --> 00:03:26,829
Welcome to Deerview.
We're glad you're here.

34
00:03:28,902 --> 00:03:31,632
Wow.
All this from a can of tuna?

35
00:03:34,941 --> 00:03:35,498
Right here.

36
00:03:35,975 --> 00:03:39,934
No<i>, </i> you gotta go up higher.
That's too high. Take it down.

37
00:03:40,213 --> 00:03:42,306
A little big more<i>, </i> a little big
more<i>, </i> a little big more.

38
00:03:43,783 --> 00:03:45,774
There<i>, </i> I like it there.
Straighten it out. That's good.

39
00:03:46,052 --> 00:03:46,484
That's good.

40
00:03:46,786 --> 00:03:48,947
Yoo-hoo! Hi.

41
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:53,456
Everyone around here is weird.

42
00:03:54,761 --> 00:03:56,888
Oh<i>, </i> they're just trying to be
friendly. They're not my friends.

43
00:03:57,196 --> 00:03:59,926
My friends live five hundred
miles away. Did you ever see away.

44
00:04:01,167 --> 00:04:03,226
Did you ever see Invasion Of
The Body Snatchers?

45
00:04:03,636 --> 00:04:06,264
They were friendly too.
Nice friendly pods.

46
00:04:06,773 --> 00:04:08,968
Yeah. Well<i>, </i> they do have that
certain game show contestant

47
00:04:09,242 --> 00:04:10,732
glow about them.

48
00:04:11,644 --> 00:04:12,804
You sure you don't want any help?

49
00:04:13,246 --> 00:04:15,237
No. If your dad can do it<i>, </i>
I can do it too.

50
00:04:16,416 --> 00:04:18,350
Alls I have to do is stick
this right in here.

51
00:04:20,453 --> 00:04:21,351
Aces<i>, </i> Nanc.

52
00:04:21,754 --> 00:04:22,618
Shut up.

53
00:05:04,464 --> 00:05:09,094
Hi. Hi. How are you? Hello!

54
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:14,963
What is that?

55
00:05:16,309 --> 00:05:19,073
Some people call it lunch.
I don't know. It's a concept.

56
00:05:19,712 --> 00:05:21,202
You haven't made lunch
since I was ten.

57
00:05:21,881 --> 00:05:23,314
Is that a casserole sandwich?

58
00:05:24,083 --> 00:05:29,146
It's tuna<i>, </i> isn't it?
Is that what you're wearing?

59
00:05:29,722 --> 00:05:30,746
Is that what you're wearing?

60
00:05:31,924 --> 00:05:33,289
Bag the earring. Let's go.

61
00:05:57,483 --> 00:05:58,381
You won't tell?

62
00:06:15,034 --> 00:06:15,523
Mrs. Seaver?

63
00:06:16,002 --> 00:06:18,129
Yeah. No<i>, </i> I mean go. It's Nancy.

64
00:06:18,438 --> 00:06:20,804
The company said you'd be here
and here you are.

65
00:06:21,774 --> 00:06:23,071
Oh<i>, </i> I'm Shelia Evans.

66
00:06:23,776 --> 00:06:24,174
Hi.

67
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:24,908
Welcome.

68
00:06:25,144 --> 00:06:25,542
Thank you.

69
00:06:25,978 --> 00:06:26,501
I'll get us some coffee.

70
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:27,368
Great.

71
00:06:27,814 --> 00:06:30,214
Oh<i>, </i> oh. Come here.
This is your office.

72
00:06:30,516 --> 00:06:33,417
Oh<i>, </i> I see they gave me
the executive suite.

73
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,351
And which hemisphere is that<i>, </i>
Christine?

74
00:06:36,823 --> 00:06:38,222
Ah<i>, </i> the southern?

75
00:06:38,558 --> 00:06:44,588
Oh<i>, </i> Hi. You must be Tim.
Class<i>, </i> this is Tim Seaver<i>, </i>

76
00:06:44,997 --> 00:06:48,364
our new student.
Everyone make him feel welcome.

77
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,508
So ah<i>, </i> you're from L.A.?

78
00:06:56,843 --> 00:06:57,400
Yeah.

79
00:06:57,944 --> 00:06:59,172
Have you been with the company long?

80
00:06:59,612 --> 00:07:06,040
Well rounding it out roughly a
week. The company sent me right

81
00:07:06,352 --> 00:07:10,789
here right after the training
course. This is the first job

82
00:07:11,157 --> 00:07:13,022
I've had in like fifteen
or sixteen years.

83
00:07:13,493 --> 00:07:13,857
Wow!

84
00:07:14,327 --> 00:07:15,123
How long have you been here?

85
00:07:15,728 --> 00:07:16,422
Ah<i>, </i> seven years.

86
00:07:16,996 --> 00:07:17,690
Whoa.

87
00:07:18,264 --> 00:07:23,702
Yeah. But I'm-I'm just a
receptionists. Um<i>, </i> anyway<i>, </i> ah<i>, </i>

88
00:07:24,036 --> 00:07:28,939
I went through the multiple
listing and I typed up everything

89
00:07:29,308 --> 00:07:32,072
that's on the market.
Now that includes things that

90
00:07:32,478 --> 00:07:33,740
are in escrow. And I also noted
how long each house has

91
00:07:33,846 --> 00:07:35,313
been for sale.

92
00:07:36,315 --> 00:07:39,182
Man<i>, </i> this must be a typo<i>, </i> 478 days?

93
00:07:39,585 --> 00:07:43,282
Oh yeah<i>, </i> sorry.
That should be 578 days.

94
00:08:20,393 --> 00:08:22,384
Hi. I'm Laurie. This is Sally.

95
00:08:23,129 --> 00:08:23,527
Hi.

96
00:08:23,796 --> 00:08:24,592
We're not interrupting are we?

97
00:08:24,897 --> 00:08:25,386
Well<i>, </i> I...

98
00:08:25,731 --> 00:08:26,254
Good.

99
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:31,459
Your house is lovely. Just lovely.

100
00:08:33,005 --> 00:08:34,996
Well<i>, </i> I was thinking about
painting the living room black.

101
00:08:35,408 --> 00:08:40,505
What do you think?
I was kidding. Just kidding.

102
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,607
Well<i>, </i> I hope you don't think we're
too pushy dropping in like this.

103
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:49,417
Shelia's told us so much about
you. Well<i>, </i> not so much.

104
00:08:49,922 --> 00:08:52,152
We know you're from Los Angeles.
Your son goes to Deerview.

105
00:08:52,491 --> 00:08:55,119
You're a widow. But it's the
little things that make a

106
00:08:55,361 --> 00:08:57,829
neighborhood. You know<i>, </i>
like what kind of hobbies you

107
00:08:58,130 --> 00:09:01,065
have<i>, </i> the kind of food you eat<i>, </i>
that that's any of our business.

108
00:09:01,968 --> 00:09:03,595
No. Of course not.

109
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:05,130
Kitchen? I'm real thirsty.

110
00:09:08,107 --> 00:09:11,270
So ah<i>, </i> Laurie's the shy one<i>, </i> right?

111
00:09:11,611 --> 00:09:12,134
Yeah.

112
00:09:13,246 --> 00:09:16,738
Mrs. Hill across the street's
widow too. You meet her yet?

113
00:09:17,116 --> 00:09:20,415
Oh yeah. We did that widow
secret handshake thing.

114
00:09:21,187 --> 00:09:22,415
You're kidding again<i>, </i> right?

115
00:09:22,955 --> 00:09:24,718
You caught me with my pants down.

116
00:09:25,424 --> 00:09:27,984
Oh<i>, </i> we came here for another
reason<i>, </i> didn't we?

117
00:09:28,361 --> 00:09:30,226
To invite Nancy to the pep really.

118
00:09:30,696 --> 00:09:32,527
Oh that's right.
You do like football<i>, </i> don't you?

119
00:09:33,032 --> 00:09:35,364
Hmm... you see<i>, </i>
our sons play junior varsity.

120
00:09:36,035 --> 00:09:39,937
Well<i>, </i> to be honest with you
football's not my thing.

121
00:09:40,239 --> 00:09:41,263
Oh really? And what is?

122
00:09:42,675 --> 00:09:48,580
Well<i>, </i> if you're talking serious
entertainment value then I'd have

123
00:09:49,081 --> 00:09:52,414
to say access cable. You know<i>, </i>
it's on all the time.

124
00:09:52,752 --> 00:09:55,983
You want to know my favorite.
Okay. It's that Priestess Of Love

125
00:09:56,289 --> 00:09:58,849
Show. I swear to God<i>, </i>
this broad sits there and

126
00:09:59,258 --> 00:10:01,726
She tells you four hundred ways
how to 'boink' your man<i>, </i> you know.

127
00:10:02,028 --> 00:10:04,997
She's got this really bazaar green
eye shadow on and this tub-top thing.

128
00:10:05,298 --> 00:10:07,425
You can't help but love her.

129
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:24,648
So<i>, </i> you'll let us know. Oh<i>, </i>
we would love for you to come.

130
00:10:25,451 --> 00:10:30,184
Well<i>, </i> thank you. Um<i>, </i> Listen<i>, </i>
I've got to get some homeowners

131
00:10:30,489 --> 00:10:32,218
insurance. Where would I go?

132
00:10:33,159 --> 00:10:34,387
Huh. Only one agent in town.

133
00:10:35,161 --> 00:10:36,685
Ann Badowski.

134
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:42,695
We could add flood<i>, </i> tornado<i>, </i>
infestation and<i>, </i> of course<i>, </i>

135
00:10:43,069 --> 00:10:44,331
mysterious disappearance coverage.

136
00:10:44,637 --> 00:10:50,371
Oh<i>, </i> for those unexpected UFO
visitations. Well<i>, </i> whatever you

137
00:10:50,943 --> 00:10:52,638
got I want it on the economy size
see<i>, </i> because I'm kinda living on

138
00:10:53,012 --> 00:10:55,310
a limited budget.

139
00:10:56,048 --> 00:10:58,516
You know<i>, </i> we should rethink that
earthquake insurance.

140
00:10:58,985 --> 00:11:01,510
A 7.5 snaker could annihilate
your home.

141
00:11:02,088 --> 00:11:06,491
Well<i>, </i> I like annihilation<i>, </i>
you know. It's like my favorite

142
00:11:06,859 --> 00:11:08,349
form of destruction.

143
00:11:09,395 --> 00:11:11,989
Alright<i>, </i> then. Who do we want to
name as beneficiary?

144
00:11:13,032 --> 00:11:13,930
Um...

145
00:11:14,767 --> 00:11:16,462
We do know the meaning
of beneficiary?

146
00:11:17,236 --> 00:11:22,936
Yes<i>, </i> 'we'<i>, </i> I do. I happen to be
one. My husband died about

147
00:11:23,342 --> 00:11:24,104
a year ago.

148
00:11:24,577 --> 00:11:28,445
Me too. I'm single<i>, </i> I mean.
Divorced. Kids?

149
00:11:28,948 --> 00:11:29,346
A son.

150
00:11:29,815 --> 00:11:30,611
Deerview High?

151
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:31,441
Yeah.

152
00:11:32,485 --> 00:11:36,512
Mine too. Boy<i>, </i> are you lucky
you came in here today.

153
00:11:36,822 --> 00:11:38,756
I did happen to mention that I'm
president of the PTA<i>, </i> didn't I?

154
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:46,189
Now<i>, </i> here is a schedule of our
activities. You'll note the

155
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:48,697
asterisks. Those are the combine
meetings with the Booster Club<i>, </i>

156
00:11:49,001 --> 00:11:49,797
which I'm also the president.

157
00:11:56,308 --> 00:11:57,240
Yooo<i>, </i> save me!

158
00:12:38,784 --> 00:12:39,716
Do you have to walk so close?

159
00:12:40,386 --> 00:12:52,696
Yes. So<i>, </i> this is what Hell is like.

160
00:12:53,065 --> 00:12:54,054
Later.

161
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:56,191
Oh<i>, </i> there she is.

162
00:12:56,335 --> 00:12:57,427
Hi!

163
00:12:58,137 --> 00:12:59,001
Oh<i>, </i> you made it.

164
00:12:59,371 --> 00:13:00,269
Yeah. Hi.

165
00:13:00,673 --> 00:13:02,072
So<i>, </i> what do you think?

166
00:13:02,775 --> 00:13:05,972
Well<i>, </i> it's beyond anything
I ever imagined.

167
00:13:07,513 --> 00:13:09,276
I am hot. Anybody else hot?

168
00:13:09,548 --> 00:13:11,175
I think Angie's pregnant again.
Hi<i>, </i> Darleen!

169
00:13:11,884 --> 00:13:13,351
Are you listening to me?
Little beads of have sweat

170
00:13:13,786 --> 00:13:14,445
dripping down my back.

171
00:13:14,854 --> 00:13:15,479
Okay<i>, </i> we get the point.

172
00:13:15,988 --> 00:13:16,682
There are our boys.

173
00:13:17,323 --> 00:13:17,812
Oh.

174
00:13:18,224 --> 00:13:19,418
Mine's the blond. Andy.

175
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:22,993
My Derek's next to him.

176
00:13:25,798 --> 00:13:27,629
Boz is the one with the string stuff.

177
00:13:29,235 --> 00:13:30,793
Boz<i>, </i> stop it!

178
00:13:31,137 --> 00:13:32,502
How proud you all must be.

179
00:13:33,072 --> 00:13:33,663
Yeah.

180
00:13:35,975 --> 00:13:37,772
G - O... Go!

181
00:13:38,944 --> 00:13:42,072
De-vil's Go!
Go - Go - G - O - De-vil's Go!

182
00:13:42,948 --> 00:13:43,346
Go - Go...

183
00:13:43,682 --> 00:13:45,513
Joe<i>, </i> who's that girl over there?
The one next from last.

184
00:13:45,784 --> 00:13:49,618
Oh<i>, </i> that's my sister<i>, </i> Betsy.
Pitiful<i>, </i> ain't it?

185
00:13:59,064 --> 00:14:02,625
Thank you<i>, </i> girls. Thank you.
Let's hear it for the Deerview

186
00:14:03,636 --> 00:14:05,365
Cheerleaders!

187
00:14:07,039 --> 00:14:09,769
And now without further ado<i>, </i>
I'd like to present to you your

188
00:14:10,176 --> 00:14:11,973
coach. Coach Jimmy Cox.

189
00:14:19,018 --> 00:14:24,479
Thank you<i>, </i> Principal Marsh. Well<i>, </i>
here we are. Another season.

190
00:14:25,991 --> 00:14:27,583
Another championship season.

191
00:14:33,465 --> 00:14:35,956
Boy<i>, </i> football's kind of a big deal
around here<i>, </i> isn't it?

192
00:14:36,669 --> 00:14:37,363
The biggest.

193
00:14:37,603 --> 00:14:42,040
We've got a bunch of touch<i>, </i> smart<i>, </i>
good boys. With your help...

194
00:14:43,175 --> 00:14:45,200
heck<i>, </i> we could do anything.

195
00:14:48,814 --> 00:14:53,808
Football isn't just a sport<i>, </i>
it's life itself. The fumbles<i>, </i>

196
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,619
the interceptions<i>, </i> the touchdowns<i>, </i>
we live 'em day to day. I am...

197
00:14:58,157 --> 00:14:59,055
Nuts.

198
00:14:59,458 --> 00:15:02,985
...reminded of a quote from
an old coach of mine...

199
00:15:03,362 --> 00:15:08,800
...Jimmy<i>, </i> the man who said winning
isn't everything was a weinie.

200
00:15:09,435 --> 00:15:10,800
On a scale of one to ten
how hurt can he get?

201
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:14,300
Coach Cox can answer all your
questions. There's your boy over

202
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:17,776
there at the boockers

203
00:15:17,776 --> 00:15:19,243
Hi<i>, </i> Timmy.

204
00:15:20,179 --> 00:15:21,703
Hey<i>, </i> Jimmy! Jimmy!

205
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:24,645
Yes.

206
00:15:24,984 --> 00:15:27,077
This is Mrs. Seaver. Tim's mom.

207
00:15:27,653 --> 00:15:28,176
How do you do?

208
00:15:28,354 --> 00:15:29,048
Hi.

209
00:15:29,655 --> 00:15:30,747
Now<i>, </i> she's a little concerned
about the ah...

210
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:33,622
Yeah<i>, </i> I just want to know if he's
going to play he's not going to

211
00:15:34,093 --> 00:15:35,822
get ripped into thousands
of pieces<i>, </i> is he?

212
00:15:36,562 --> 00:15:38,757
Now<i>, </i> I can assure you that
Coach Cox plays a safe game.

213
00:15:39,231 --> 00:15:43,190
Ah<i>, </i> excuse me<i>, </i> Howard.
I play the way we need to play.

214
00:15:43,636 --> 00:15:44,466
I know that but...

215
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:46,904
You wouldn't want to tell how
to run this team<i>, </i> would ya?

216
00:15:47,706 --> 00:15:48,070
Of course not.

217
00:15:48,507 --> 00:15:48,973
Good.

218
00:15:49,908 --> 00:15:52,206
Ah<i>, </i> maybe this isn't a good time.

219
00:15:52,444 --> 00:15:54,241
No<i>, </i> no<i>, </i> no. Don't go running off.

220
00:15:54,513 --> 00:15:55,878
Actually<i>, </i> we've been like this
for years. We used to play

221
00:15:56,515 --> 00:15:57,345
against each other.

222
00:15:57,783 --> 00:15:59,080
Oh<i>, </i> you played football?

223
00:15:59,985 --> 00:16:01,680
You didn't tell you about '76?

224
00:16:02,354 --> 00:16:03,378
I guess it never came up.

225
00:16:04,957 --> 00:16:10,953
See<i>, </i> it was County Championship
game 1976. Howie here is this big

226
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:13,891
deal player. Collage scouts come
to see him play. Where were they

227
00:16:14,133 --> 00:16:14,827
from again?

228
00:16:15,134 --> 00:16:15,532
USC.

229
00:16:15,834 --> 00:16:18,735
Yeah<i>, </i> yeah<i>, </i> yeah. Anyway<i>, </i>
Howster's QB at Deerview.

230
00:16:19,138 --> 00:16:23,905
Me<i>, </i> defensive end<i>, </i> Lincoln High.
I knew there's only way we're going

231
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:29,714
to win that game. Get in the 1st
half. Deerview's third and goal

232
00:16:30,015 --> 00:16:34,349
at the seventh. I knew Howie was
going to fake left<i>, </i> so<i>, </i>

233
00:16:34,753 --> 00:16:38,621
he faked left and who do you
think he found on his right?

234
00:16:39,191 --> 00:16:39,555
You?

235
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:49,058
Oh! It was beautiful.
Sacked and out! Of course<i>, </i> ah<i>, </i>

236
00:16:49,401 --> 00:16:52,370
I never meant to break your leg
like that. But we won the game.

237
00:16:52,705 --> 00:16:53,433
And that's all that's important.

238
00:16:53,772 --> 00:16:55,603
You bet. Oh<i>, </i> excuse me.

239
00:16:56,208 --> 00:17:00,668
Thank you for sharing.
I feel much better now.

240
00:17:01,246 --> 00:17:01,678
Me too.

241
00:17:09,121 --> 00:17:15,685
Touch down<i>, </i> Devils score.
Touch down... six more...

242
00:17:16,028 --> 00:17:17,359
Devils score.
Touch down... six more...

243
00:17:17,696 --> 00:17:21,655
Hey Dooley<i>, </i> Coach wants to see
you. It's about the fathers

244
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:22,329
and sons game.

245
00:17:22,701 --> 00:17:23,292
Oh yeah<i>, </i> right.

246
00:17:23,535 --> 00:17:24,467
I forgot about that.

247
00:17:25,037 --> 00:17:27,631
Yeah<i>, </i> my dad's already starting
to do sit-ups and stuff.

248
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:31,767
Well<i>, </i> they have to.
They're so old. See ya.

249
00:17:47,025 --> 00:17:57,924
I thought you were at the
Dooley's. Guess I was wrong.

250
00:18:01,874 --> 00:18:02,533
Are you okay?

251
00:18:04,243 --> 00:18:04,641
Just tired.

252
00:18:06,278 --> 00:18:07,108
Did you do your homework?

253
00:18:07,713 --> 00:18:07,974
Yep.

254
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:08,971
Geometry?

255
00:18:09,348 --> 00:18:09,905
I said yes!

256
00:18:12,017 --> 00:18:13,712
Well<i>, </i> do you want to make
an ice cream run?

257
00:18:14,086 --> 00:18:14,450
No.

258
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:15,514
No?!

259
00:18:15,888 --> 00:18:18,049
You know the echo's getting
worse in here! Hey!

260
00:18:22,361 --> 00:18:22,850
What's going on?

261
00:18:23,495 --> 00:18:24,052
Nothing.

262
00:18:24,463 --> 00:18:25,521
Well<i>, </i> something's bugging you.

263
00:18:26,231 --> 00:18:27,960
Why? Because I don't want ice cream?

264
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,230
Is it school?

265
00:18:29,635 --> 00:18:30,533
Why are you doing this?

266
00:18:30,903 --> 00:18:31,369
Is it your friends?

267
00:18:31,503 --> 00:18:32,094
Stop!

268
00:18:32,571 --> 00:18:33,936
I'm just trying to figure out
what's wrong?

269
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:38,476
You want to know what's wrong?
What's right? We move from home.

270
00:18:38,677 --> 00:18:41,111
I hate my English teacher.
You ask me four thousand questions

271
00:18:41,647 --> 00:18:44,480
a day and there's a fathers
ons//football game coming up.

272
00:18:45,584 --> 00:18:45,811
Oh<i>, </i> Tim.

273
00:18:46,318 --> 00:18:49,879
You want to help? Give me back our
old life. My old friends.

274
00:18:50,155 --> 00:18:51,213
Give me back my bad!

275
00:18:58,664 --> 00:18:59,756
I wish I could.

276
00:19:02,935 --> 00:19:05,233
You all know how important the
fathers/sons game is to the school

277
00:19:05,637 --> 00:19:08,970
as a found-raiser. So<i>, </i>
I hope all your fathers out there

278
00:19:09,408 --> 00:19:11,399
are getting into shape so you can
beat the sons this year.

279
00:19:13,045 --> 00:19:15,377
Mr. Harris assures me that his
broken ankle is healed and he's

280
00:19:15,614 --> 00:19:17,946
ready to go full steam ahead.

281
00:19:22,421 --> 00:19:24,912
Any of you moms out there who
want to bake for the bake sale<i>, </i>

282
00:19:25,357 --> 00:19:29,691
the sign up sheet's up here.
Let me emphasis that you can not

283
00:19:29,962 --> 00:19:33,659
over do on the brownies.
You know how our men are.

284
00:19:33,966 --> 00:19:37,299
They love their chocolate.
You know baking is something

285
00:19:37,669 --> 00:19:39,762
that any of us can do.
Even us single gals.

286
00:19:40,272 --> 00:19:43,673
So<i>, </i> without further ado<i>, </i>
I'd like to introduce the man

287
00:19:44,042 --> 00:19:46,374
who's going to lead your sons
to another glorious game<i>, </i>

288
00:19:46,678 --> 00:19:47,110
Coach Jimmy Cox.

289
00:19:47,479 --> 00:19:47,945
What'd I miss?

290
00:19:48,714 --> 00:19:50,682
The bake sale.
Hey<i>, </i> what's with the jacket?

291
00:19:51,049 --> 00:19:51,845
What? Is it too much?

292
00:19:52,251 --> 00:19:53,377
Well<i>, </i> not to Annie Oakly.

293
00:19:53,852 --> 00:19:54,318
Tttt.

294
00:19:54,553 --> 00:19:58,284
Thank you<i>, </i> Mrs. Badowski. So<i>, </i>
we're all looking forward to that

295
00:19:58,724 --> 00:19:59,782
game<i>, </i> aren't we dads?

296
00:20:01,226 --> 00:20:05,595
You men know we play for fun.
For laughs. Hey<i>, </i> with nine guys

297
00:20:06,131 --> 00:20:08,031
on the side you get plenty of
rest for substitutions.

298
00:20:09,468 --> 00:20:12,232
But seriously there is that fund
raising side of things. Ah<i>, </i> ladies<i>, </i>

299
00:20:12,871 --> 00:20:17,740
like Ann said<i>, </i> we need your help
too. Baking<i>, </i> the car wash<i>, </i>

300
00:20:18,143 --> 00:20:22,477
ticker sales... Ah<i>, </i> volunteer?
Mrs. Badowski has sign up

301
00:20:23,081 --> 00:20:24,275
sheets for ya.

302
00:20:24,616 --> 00:20:25,514
I don't bake.

303
00:20:26,151 --> 00:20:28,984
Oh. So<i>, </i> what do you want?

304
00:20:29,588 --> 00:20:30,555
I wanna play.

305
00:20:36,628 --> 00:20:39,426
I'd like a shot at being
in the fathers/sons game.

306
00:20:42,134 --> 00:20:43,965
I'm sorry<i>, </i> that's just not possible.

307
00:20:44,469 --> 00:20:45,128
Why?

308
00:20:49,174 --> 00:20:50,835
Well<i>, </i> it just isn't<i>, </i> alright?

309
00:20:51,276 --> 00:20:55,610
No<i>, </i> it's not alright!
My son doesn't have a father and

310
00:20:56,081 --> 00:20:59,141
I want to play. I mean<i>, </i>
I know I'm new to this town and

311
00:20:59,418 --> 00:21:03,286
everything. I just don't get you
people. I mean<i>, </i> geez<i>, </i>

312
00:21:03,722 --> 00:21:06,748
especially you women.
This is the best you can do?

313
00:21:07,726 --> 00:21:13,062
A bake sale? Don't you remember
like fighting for equal rights?

314
00:21:13,432 --> 00:21:14,194
Equal rights?

315
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:20,467
Don't let these men push you
around. I want to roll in the dirt.

316
00:21:21,139 --> 00:21:23,073
I want to have some fun.
I want to play football.

317
00:21:23,675 --> 00:21:24,403
Come on<i>, </i> sit down!

318
00:21:24,843 --> 00:21:25,867
Harry!

319
00:21:26,211 --> 00:21:26,905
Mrs. Steamer!

320
00:21:27,212 --> 00:21:27,701
Seaver!

321
00:21:28,046 --> 00:21:31,812
Mrs. Seaver<i>, </i> we'd love to have
you play but let's be practical.

322
00:21:32,451 --> 00:21:36,785
It's too dangerous. Look at Mr.
Evans here. Put pads and a helmet

323
00:21:37,456 --> 00:21:40,721
on him. What happens if he
accidently falls on you?

324
00:21:42,594 --> 00:21:44,459
Not a pretty picture<i>, </i> is it?

325
00:21:44,763 --> 00:21:49,928
No. No<i>, </i> it's not.
You know you are absolutely right.

326
00:21:50,502 --> 00:21:55,667
Let's lose the dads and what about
a mothers/sons game?!!!

327
00:22:11,289 --> 00:22:12,779
Sign the tardy sheet and
you'll have to bring a note

328
00:22:13,125 --> 00:22:13,420
from your mother.

329
00:22:13,592 --> 00:22:14,149
Okay. Okay.

330
00:22:17,095 --> 00:22:18,392
Sorry. Car trouble.

331
00:22:19,131 --> 00:22:19,790
Mrs. Seaver.

332
00:22:20,899 --> 00:22:23,697
Well<i>, </i> I would like to continue
our discussion about the mothers

333
00:22:24,036 --> 00:22:25,333
and sons football game.

334
00:22:26,271 --> 00:22:27,067
There is no game.

335
00:22:28,674 --> 00:22:32,041
Well<i>, </i> in that case<i>, </i> do the words
sexual discrimination suit mean

336
00:22:32,678 --> 00:22:33,645
anything to you?

337
00:22:33,945 --> 00:22:38,541
Wait a minute! How'd we go from a
football game to a sex suit?!

338
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:40,747
I'm sure Mrs. Seaver didn't mean...

339
00:22:41,053 --> 00:22:44,045
Can I interject here?
I think I know Nancy better than

340
00:22:44,289 --> 00:22:48,350
anyone else in the room. Single<i>, </i>
alone. I know what it's like to

341
00:22:48,727 --> 00:22:51,195
stand on the sidelines of life.
Even though we can't play Nancy<i>, </i>

342
00:22:51,530 --> 00:22:53,157
we can still cheer the others on.

343
00:22:53,699 --> 00:22:56,463
Well<i>, </i> I don't want to cheer.
And I don't want to patronized.

344
00:22:56,935 --> 00:22:59,529
I just want to play football.
And if you have a problem with

345
00:22:59,938 --> 00:23:02,202
that<i>, </i> well<i>, </i> I'm really sorry but
I'm not going to give up.

346
00:23:03,575 --> 00:23:06,305
Howard? Howard?

347
00:23:07,379 --> 00:23:07,845
Yeah.

348
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:11,106
You're boy's VP<i>, </i>
tell her how the boys will react.

349
00:23:13,485 --> 00:23:18,980
They'll hate it... at first<i>, </i>
then they'll love the idea of

350
00:23:19,357 --> 00:23:20,381
creaming their moms.

351
00:23:21,093 --> 00:23:24,290
Great. Just great<i>, </i> Peterman.
Maybe you'd like to coach them.

352
00:23:24,763 --> 00:23:25,695
They're about your speed.

353
00:23:25,931 --> 00:23:28,764
Would you give us a minute<i>, </i> Mrs.
Seaver? Perhaps Mr. Peterman could

354
00:23:29,134 --> 00:23:30,431
show you our trophy case.

355
00:23:51,056 --> 00:23:53,786
Well<i>, </i> I suppose I should thank you
for standing up for me.

356
00:23:53,992 --> 00:23:55,152
You don't have to.

357
00:23:56,128 --> 00:23:58,255
Yeah<i>, </i> you're damn right.
Especially since I know you

358
00:23:58,597 --> 00:23:59,154
weren't trying to help me.

359
00:23:59,731 --> 00:24:00,163
I wasn't?

360
00:24:00,432 --> 00:24:02,457
You were just trying to
get at Coach Cox.

361
00:24:03,702 --> 00:24:04,498
Maybe a little.

362
00:24:05,036 --> 00:24:05,900
Maybe a lot.

363
00:24:06,538 --> 00:24:08,199
Lady<i>, </i> I take it where ever
I can get it.

364
00:24:09,908 --> 00:24:13,503
No! No<i>, </i> no<i>, </i> no!

365
00:24:13,812 --> 00:24:17,077
She's only asking to play against
her son. You can still have

366
00:24:17,449 --> 00:24:19,007
the Varsity fathers
ons game.

367
00:24:19,551 --> 00:24:22,179
It's humiliating! It's un-American!

368
00:24:22,721 --> 00:24:25,246
Look<i>, </i> you have nothing to worry
about. In order to pull this

369
00:24:25,757 --> 00:24:27,782
thing off she's got to recruit
enough mothers to play.

370
00:24:28,226 --> 00:24:30,194
And you can take it from me there
are not nine mothers in this

371
00:24:30,395 --> 00:24:31,760
town who will do this.

372
00:24:32,264 --> 00:24:33,526
Do you think they'll go for it?

373
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:35,767
Not a chance.

374
00:24:39,204 --> 00:24:44,301
Mrs. Seaver? You've got two weeks.
If you can't get a team of nine

375
00:24:44,776 --> 00:24:47,745
organized by then I never want to
hear about this again.

376
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:49,437
Deal!

377
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:55,852
You guys want one of these?

378
00:24:56,121 --> 00:24:59,557
They're Blue Hawaiis. Oh<i>, </i> okay.
They're good.

379
00:25:00,692 --> 00:25:01,716
Nancy!

380
00:25:01,827 --> 00:25:02,987
Oh<i>, </i> Hi<i>, </i> Joe.

381
00:25:03,261 --> 00:25:03,659
Say hello to camera.

382
00:25:04,095 --> 00:25:04,789
Hello. Hello.

383
00:25:05,063 --> 00:25:06,462
Our lovely hostess.
Good. Good stuff.

384
00:25:06,832 --> 00:25:07,594
Yuck!

385
00:25:11,736 --> 00:25:12,760
Why don't Nancy invite her?

386
00:25:14,072 --> 00:25:14,902
She didn't.

387
00:25:15,974 --> 00:25:18,135
Are you implying I might have
let the word get out? Really.

388
00:25:20,846 --> 00:25:22,211
Let's get this over with.

389
00:25:23,048 --> 00:25:23,446
Hi.

390
00:25:23,782 --> 00:25:24,771
Ahola.

391
00:25:25,217 --> 00:25:26,047
I brought you some cupcakes.

392
00:25:26,384 --> 00:25:28,215
Oh<i>, </i> that's very very sweet.
Well<i>, </i> what do you think?

393
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:31,487
Oh<i>, </i> it's very festive.

394
00:25:32,958 --> 00:25:35,358
I love what you're wearing<i>, </i>
Shelia. It's very Don't Ho of you.

395
00:25:36,595 --> 00:25:36,993
Thanks.

396
00:25:38,496 --> 00:25:41,260
I'm trying to organize this
mothers and sons football game

397
00:25:41,499 --> 00:25:41,931
thing<i>, </i> you know.

398
00:25:42,267 --> 00:25:45,668
Hey<i>, </i> hey<i>, </i> don't even think
about it. Shelia.

399
00:25:46,104 --> 00:25:48,299
I heard you. We all heard you.

400
00:25:54,779 --> 00:25:56,337
He probably has hair
on his back too.

401
00:26:07,926 --> 00:26:10,451
Hey<i>, </i> I've been meaning to talk to
the two of you about this mothers

402
00:26:10,896 --> 00:26:11,385
football game...

403
00:26:11,897 --> 00:26:12,329
No.

404
00:26:13,765 --> 00:26:16,199
No really<i>, </i>
don't beat around the bush.

405
00:26:19,304 --> 00:26:22,762
I knew there was an ulterior
motive for this Trader Vic food fest.

406
00:26:24,042 --> 00:26:25,066
Think she'll pull this off?

407
00:26:25,377 --> 00:26:27,402
Actually<i>, </i> you know what?
I kind of hopes she does.

408
00:26:28,213 --> 00:26:28,907
What are you talking about?

409
00:26:29,247 --> 00:26:32,375
Remember last year's game?
I was so sore afterwards I had

410
00:26:32,684 --> 00:26:34,549
to have the kids tie
my shoes for a week.

411
00:26:37,155 --> 00:26:37,951
Here we go.

412
00:26:39,457 --> 00:26:40,014
What is this?

413
00:26:40,392 --> 00:26:41,381
Teriyaki surprise.

414
00:26:42,627 --> 00:26:43,252
Surprise?

415
00:26:44,262 --> 00:26:47,959
Just eat it. Open your mouth<i>, </i>
shove it in and eat it.

416
00:26:48,833 --> 00:26:51,802
Forget it<i>, </i> Mr. Harris.
My mom is a total whimp.

417
00:26:52,871 --> 00:26:54,270
He calls them like he sees them.

418
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:58,073
Joanne<i>, </i> this is Nancy.
Nancy<i>, </i> this is Joanne.

419
00:26:58,443 --> 00:26:59,432
Hi<i>, </i> Joanne<i>, </i> nice to meet you.

420
00:26:59,711 --> 00:27:01,872
Oh<i>, </i> I've been meaning to call you.
I work at the aerobic studio

421
00:27:02,447 --> 00:27:03,641
down the street from you.

422
00:27:06,952 --> 00:27:08,977
I thought maybe we could
have lunch or something.

423
00:27:10,422 --> 00:27:11,889
I'm tell you they're not real.

424
00:27:12,557 --> 00:27:14,422
You know I'm glad you brought up
this aerobics thing see<i>, </i>

425
00:27:15,093 --> 00:27:17,391
because I'm trying to put together
this mothers and sons football...

426
00:27:17,729 --> 00:27:20,493
Nancy! Darling<i>, </i> you're running a
little low on the Ramaki.

427
00:27:20,932 --> 00:27:23,992
Oh and how very thoughtful of you
to point that out to me<i>, </i> Ann.

428
00:27:24,836 --> 00:27:28,101
Mmm... really different tasting.
What gives it that unusual flavor?

429
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:29,565
Prunes.

430
00:27:39,918 --> 00:27:42,352
Shelia<i>, </i> you will be singing the
school fight song at the

431
00:27:42,687 --> 00:27:43,949
fathers
ons football game<i>, </i>//won't you?

432
00:27:44,189 --> 00:27:45,952
I really hadn't planned on...

433
00:27:46,157 --> 00:27:47,419
Oh<i>, </i> you must. With your voice.
Besides it just won't be a

434
00:27:47,625 --> 00:27:49,354
fathers
ons game without you.

435
00:27:50,662 --> 00:27:51,924
If there is a fathers
ons game.

436
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:54,926
Oh<i>, </i> there will be. Oh<i>, </i> excuse me.

437
00:28:13,685 --> 00:28:17,052
Talk about your basic damage<i>, </i>
Seaver. Your mom is totally weird.

438
00:28:17,822 --> 00:28:18,686
You're mom isn't?

439
00:28:19,891 --> 00:28:21,222
I know what you're doing<i>, </i> Ann.

440
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:22,920
What do you mean?

441
00:28:24,195 --> 00:28:28,598
Right. Well<i>, </i> hey<i>, </i> you like to be
helpful<i>, </i> don't ya? Not that I want

442
00:28:28,967 --> 00:28:32,061
to take you away from all of your
socializing or anything but<i>, </i>

443
00:28:32,303 --> 00:28:35,466
could you do me a really big
favor? I've got a couple of

444
00:28:35,974 --> 00:28:38,704
pineapples sitting out in the
kitchen. Could you cut them up

445
00:28:38,977 --> 00:28:41,639
and put them on this plate here?
Oh<i>, </i> you're such an angle<i>, </i>

446
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:42,503
thank you so much.

447
00:28:53,858 --> 00:28:55,450
Nancy<i>, </i> thank you. Great party.

448
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:56,217
Thank you for coming.

449
00:28:56,294 --> 00:28:57,886
Yeah<i>, </i> I've got some great shots.

450
00:28:58,163 --> 00:28:58,629
Yeah<i>, </i> I want you to make me a copy.

451
00:28:58,997 --> 00:28:59,895
I'll come over and play it for you.

452
00:29:00,198 --> 00:29:01,722
Not that I have a VCR or anything.

453
00:29:02,167 --> 00:29:04,158
I'll get you one. Alright come on<i>, </i>
Julie's in the car. Come on!

454
00:29:04,436 --> 00:29:09,271
Bye ladies. Oh<i>, </i> Laurie<i>, </i> dearest.
I've notice that you have not

455
00:29:09,641 --> 00:29:12,132
signed up for the bake sale.
Remember<i>, </i> 'nothing says loving

456
00:29:12,410 --> 00:29:14,878
like something from the over. '
Call me. Tootles!

457
00:29:17,682 --> 00:29:19,673
I don't believe it.
She actually thinks I'm going to

458
00:29:20,051 --> 00:29:21,814
be inspired from a quote from
the pillsbury Dough Boy.

459
00:29:22,587 --> 00:29:24,020
You know my son thinks I'm a whimp?

460
00:29:24,422 --> 00:29:25,514
My husband won't let me do anything?

461
00:29:26,624 --> 00:29:28,182
Aren't we tired of being
pushed around?

462
00:29:33,198 --> 00:29:35,826
I want to toll in the dirt!
I want to have some fun!

463
00:29:36,434 --> 00:29:37,526
I want to kick some butt!

464
00:29:38,203 --> 00:29:39,602
Is this some sexual problem?

465
00:29:40,438 --> 00:29:44,738
No. I am not a whimp.
We want to play football.

466
00:29:45,877 --> 00:29:46,468
Are you serious?

467
00:29:47,312 --> 00:29:48,279
Well<i>, </i> what do we have to lose?

468
00:29:48,513 --> 00:29:50,105
Our kids and husbands
don't respect us.

469
00:29:50,548 --> 00:29:51,640
Well<i>, </i> that's true.

470
00:29:52,050 --> 00:29:54,314
Besides we all hate baking.

471
00:29:56,788 --> 00:29:58,346
Great!

472
00:30:13,004 --> 00:30:13,993
Yeah<i>, </i> I'm as coordinated as an ox.

473
00:30:14,439 --> 00:30:17,101
Yeah<i>, </i> me too. But I'm gonna do it.
I'm gonna show those little pigs.

474
00:30:18,643 --> 00:30:19,200
Nancy<i>, </i> Hi!

475
00:30:19,577 --> 00:30:20,043
Hi!

476
00:30:20,211 --> 00:30:20,939
Hi!

477
00:30:21,513 --> 00:30:23,276
Look<i>, </i> if anyone sings the Rocky
theme I'm outta here.

478
00:30:49,674 --> 00:30:50,333
Hey<i>, </i> boys.

479
00:31:06,024 --> 00:31:06,820
Oh look<i>, </i> there's Howard.

480
00:31:07,158 --> 00:31:16,260
Really? Look<i>, </i> keep going.
I'll be back.

481
00:31:19,804 --> 00:31:21,533
I need a wind machine. Okay.

482
00:31:24,075 --> 00:31:24,837
You think it's funny?

483
00:31:25,577 --> 00:31:26,441
Ah<i>, </i> yeah.

484
00:31:28,079 --> 00:31:32,243
Well<i>, </i> listen<i>, </i> Mr. I was A Football
Hero<i>, </i> how about putting some

485
00:31:32,684 --> 00:31:33,844
of your expertise where
your mouth is.

486
00:31:35,119 --> 00:31:38,850
You're asking for my help?
I am flattered.

487
00:31:39,457 --> 00:31:42,449
Course<i>, </i> I'll still be the coach<i>, </i>
you know. But you can help with

488
00:31:42,794 --> 00:31:43,317
the strategy.

489
00:31:43,928 --> 00:31:46,863
You mean how to pass and how to
catch? And how to tackle.

490
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:51,334
Ah<i>, </i> exactly.

491
00:31:51,669 --> 00:31:52,897
I'll think about it.

492
00:31:53,338 --> 00:31:55,704
I'll be fun you know.
Out there on the grid iron.

493
00:31:56,107 --> 00:31:56,971
Running those plays.

494
00:31:57,275 --> 00:31:58,537
I said I'd think about it.

495
00:32:01,312 --> 00:32:04,440
Thinking's good.
I can except thinking.

496
00:32:10,922 --> 00:32:13,618
She's going to ruin everything.
Seaver's mom comes to town.

497
00:32:14,392 --> 00:32:19,056
She's going to blow it.
Am I in your way<i>, </i> Seaver?

498
00:32:21,399 --> 00:32:22,764
You got a problem<i>, </i> Badowski?

499
00:32:23,134 --> 00:32:26,968
Me? Naw. I was just explaining
to them what 'macho' meant.

500
00:32:27,505 --> 00:32:30,633
'Macho' as in manly.
As in Seaver's mom.

501
00:32:35,313 --> 00:32:35,972
Excuse me?

502
00:32:37,915 --> 00:32:38,347
Coach!

503
00:32:38,616 --> 00:32:41,244
I bet she likes chewing tobacco
and tracker pulls.

504
00:32:41,986 --> 00:32:43,385
Don't do nothing<i>, </i> Joey.

505
00:32:43,888 --> 00:32:44,547
Shouldn't we do something?!

506
00:32:44,889 --> 00:32:45,378
Stay outta this.

507
00:32:48,693 --> 00:32:51,594
Break it up! Break it up!
Break it up.

508
00:32:57,969 --> 00:33:01,063
Ever hit anyone before?
Hurts don't it?

509
00:33:01,973 --> 00:33:02,632
Felt great.

510
00:33:03,474 --> 00:33:05,601
Badowski must have said something
pretty awful to make you go that wild.

511
00:33:06,911 --> 00:33:08,003
Yeah. Something.

512
00:33:08,413 --> 00:33:12,349
Something about your mom?
Lucky guess. I'm also guessing that

513
00:33:12,684 --> 00:33:14,515
right now the earth would open
up and swallow her whole.

514
00:33:15,253 --> 00:33:16,242
Keep that on there.

515
00:33:17,755 --> 00:33:19,848
You and Coach Cox don't get along<i>, </i>
huh. Nancy told me how Cox

516
00:33:20,124 --> 00:33:20,852
broke your leg.

517
00:33:21,559 --> 00:33:24,027
Coach Cox and I aren't the issue
and neither is Badowski.

518
00:33:24,562 --> 00:33:25,859
Let's get back to the part
about your mom.

519
00:33:28,066 --> 00:33:31,001
It's like she's becoming this
different person.

520
00:33:31,302 --> 00:33:33,930
She's always been a little cranked
but ever since we moved here.

521
00:33:34,572 --> 00:33:37,973
It's like this Mothers
ons//football game. I mean she never

522
00:33:38,443 --> 00:33:40,934
would have done that before.
Why can't she just leave things

523
00:33:43,014 --> 00:33:45,448
alone? Just don't make her
come get me<i>, </i> alright?

524
00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:46,878
I have to<i>, </i> Tim.

525
00:33:47,752 --> 00:33:50,448
What? Is that part of the Vice
Principal's code of honor?

526
00:33:50,788 --> 00:33:51,379
Give her a chance.

527
00:33:52,990 --> 00:33:53,388
Please.

528
00:33:58,096 --> 00:34:00,758
You won't let it happen again?
Least not this year?

529
00:34:01,165 --> 00:34:01,460
I swear.

530
00:34:03,134 --> 00:34:04,897
Alright. Get outta here.

531
00:34:06,904 --> 00:34:09,839
It's over 24 hundred square feet
and the very best part about the

532
00:34:10,241 --> 00:34:13,574
whole house is backyard here.
I mean<i>, </i> talk about low maintenance.

533
00:34:13,911 --> 00:34:15,503
Can I go back there?

534
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:16,877
Sure. Have a party.

535
00:34:22,587 --> 00:34:23,383
What are the neighbors like?

536
00:34:23,921 --> 00:34:25,013
Oh<i>, </i> they couldn't be nicer.

537
00:34:33,264 --> 00:34:35,095
Oh! Nice doggy! Nice doggy!

538
00:34:37,935 --> 00:34:39,095
His bark is much worse than his bite.

539
00:34:40,104 --> 00:34:40,570
Oh.

540
00:34:46,511 --> 00:34:50,675
Oh yeah. Right there. It feels good.

541
00:34:51,082 --> 00:34:51,639
Hmm...

542
00:34:52,683 --> 00:34:59,350
Oh yeah. Right there. Oh<i>, </i> Nancy! Hi!

543
00:35:00,024 --> 00:35:02,458
Howard was just showing me how
to get rid of my headaches.

544
00:35:02,493 --> 00:35:04,859
Wow<i>, </i> I can't wait to see what
you do for hemorrhoides.

545
00:35:05,163 --> 00:35:08,894
Oh lis... oh<i>, </i> I better get home.

546
00:35:09,267 --> 00:35:10,495
See you.

547
00:35:10,902 --> 00:35:12,836
I'll see you. Ah<i>, </i> your messages
are on the desk<i>, </i> Nanc. Bye!

548
00:35:17,975 --> 00:35:19,033
Tim got in a fight at the game.

549
00:35:19,510 --> 00:35:19,976
A fight?

550
00:35:20,545 --> 00:35:20,977
He's fine.

551
00:35:21,779 --> 00:35:22,507
What was it about?

552
00:35:23,181 --> 00:35:23,840
I don't know.

553
00:35:24,282 --> 00:35:25,544
Well<i>, </i> why didn't you call me?

554
00:35:25,850 --> 00:35:27,374
Because he asked me not to.

555
00:35:27,885 --> 00:35:29,910
Well you still should have.
I mean isn't that part of the

556
00:35:30,288 --> 00:35:32,313
Vice Principal's code of honor?

557
00:35:33,491 --> 00:35:37,154
That's what he said. Look<i>, </i>
Tim is having a little bit of

558
00:35:37,428 --> 00:35:39,487
trouble adjusting and I think that
the Moms/Sons football game is

559
00:35:39,864 --> 00:35:41,661
like setting him up as a target.

560
00:35:41,999 --> 00:35:44,490
Oh<i>, </i> yeah<i>, </i> yeah.
I forgot. You got your PH. D

561
00:35:45,136 --> 00:35:46,433
in Child Psychology.

562
00:35:46,938 --> 00:35:48,667
Right. Like it's hard to figure
out that your mom playing football

563
00:35:49,006 --> 00:35:49,836
is embarrassing.

564
00:35:50,274 --> 00:35:52,640
Well<i>, </i> it wouldn't be if we weren't
so bad. I mean<i>, </i> if we could get

565
00:35:53,010 --> 00:35:54,875
some help... if you'd help coach.

566
00:35:55,179 --> 00:35:56,168
Whoa<i>, </i> I know where this is going.

567
00:35:57,615 --> 00:35:59,344
Well<i>, </i> if you don't want to do it
for us then you should do it

568
00:35:59,851 --> 00:36:02,081
for yourself. Think of the
satisfaction you'd get by beating

569
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:07,551
Jimmy Cox. By totally seeing him
humiliated in front of all those

570
00:36:07,859 --> 00:36:09,690
people<i>, </i> you know.
Losing to a bunch of women.

571
00:36:09,961 --> 00:36:14,330
Losing to you. You can almost
taste it<i>, </i> can't you Howard?

572
00:36:16,834 --> 00:36:21,567
Revenge is sweet. I'm telling you.
It's very very sweet.

573
00:36:25,643 --> 00:36:26,109
Where's my fork?

574
00:36:26,410 --> 00:36:28,002
Mom<i>, </i> I'm starving!

575
00:36:28,713 --> 00:36:29,611
Coming right up!

576
00:36:30,882 --> 00:36:31,746
You're such a brat.

577
00:36:33,184 --> 00:36:34,242
Potatoes<i>, </i> please. Potatoes.

578
00:36:35,386 --> 00:36:36,478
Pass the pess.

579
00:36:37,188 --> 00:36:37,654
Here we go. It's an even trade.
So Joe<i>, </i> what'd you get on that

580
00:36:37,855 --> 00:36:42,724
history test the other day.
You know the one you had on Monday?

581
00:36:49,734 --> 00:36:50,666
The day after Sunday.

582
00:36:51,502 --> 00:36:54,994
Oh yeah. I got a

583
00:36:58,943 --> 00:37:00,137
A 'B'?

584
00:37:03,414 --> 00:37:04,176
A 'D'.

585
00:37:13,624 --> 00:37:15,216
Next time try harder. Okay?

586
00:37:15,693 --> 00:37:16,125
Okay.

587
00:37:16,394 --> 00:37:25,530
You're so lucky. I just don't get
it. I mean<i>, </i> why do you like

588
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:27,098
hanging here?

589
00:37:28,706 --> 00:37:31,368
I don't know. I guess I like you.
All of you.

590
00:37:33,611 --> 00:37:35,101
How many bathrooms at your house?

591
00:37:36,047 --> 00:37:37,514
These places are all the same.

592
00:37:38,282 --> 00:37:41,581
Okay. So<i>, </i> three bathrooms and
only two people.

593
00:37:42,553 --> 00:37:43,611
Want to trade families?

594
00:37:44,855 --> 00:37:46,186
Believe me you wouldn't want to.

595
00:37:47,892 --> 00:37:51,760
Oh yeah<i>, </i> because if you lived here
it would mean like you're a

596
00:37:52,196 --> 00:37:55,188
brother. To bad too.
We couldn't become friends.

597
00:37:57,101 --> 00:37:58,033
We have potential.

598
00:38:00,037 --> 00:38:01,937
Faith<i>, </i> honey! Paper towels!

599
00:38:02,373 --> 00:38:03,772
Paper towels coming right up.

600
00:38:18,856 --> 00:38:20,016
Hut<i>, </i> hut!

601
00:38:20,925 --> 00:38:23,723
Hike! Hey<i>, </i> next time keep your
head up. That big can on the

602
00:38:23,995 --> 00:38:25,019
right almost juked you.

603
00:38:27,231 --> 00:38:28,892
Is this like a thing with you?
How do you know where I live?

604
00:38:29,233 --> 00:38:31,292
And where I work?

605
00:38:31,669 --> 00:38:34,263
Privileges of membership.
School records.

606
00:38:35,673 --> 00:38:37,436
Or invasion of privacy.

607
00:38:42,913 --> 00:38:44,574
I burn<i>, </i> do not chop.

608
00:38:53,190 --> 00:38:53,952
Hey<i>, </i> how's Tim doing?

609
00:38:54,625 --> 00:39:00,757
He's not speaking to me.
Not that it's any of your business.

610
00:39:01,065 --> 00:39:03,158
Boy<i>, </i> if you act like that
I'll change my mind again.

611
00:39:03,401 --> 00:39:03,992
About what?

612
00:39:04,235 --> 00:39:07,170
About helping you out.
Like you said. Revenge is sweet.

613
00:39:07,938 --> 00:39:11,704
I knew I couldn't be wrong about
you! We're like two peas

614
00:39:11,876 --> 00:39:13,241
in podsville.

615
00:39:13,711 --> 00:39:15,008
You want to run that by me again?

616
00:39:15,379 --> 00:39:19,076
Yeah. We're alike<i>, </i> you and me.
Trouble makers.

617
00:39:19,350 --> 00:39:22,547
You actually thought something
nice about me? Must be my smile.

618
00:39:23,187 --> 00:39:26,122
Women are really into smiles and
I got a pretty into smiles and

619
00:39:26,357 --> 00:39:28,382
got a pretty damn good one.
No coffee stains or nothing.

620
00:39:28,659 --> 00:39:29,683
Just a little overbite.
Chicks dig that.

621
00:39:30,394 --> 00:39:32,555
Well you know if was shopping for
a horse teeth might really be

622
00:39:33,264 --> 00:39:36,563
an issue but I just want you to
show us how to throw a ball.

623
00:39:37,468 --> 00:39:38,958
She says as she stares at my dimples.

624
00:39:39,203 --> 00:39:40,033
Can we get down to it?

625
00:39:40,237 --> 00:39:41,636
Hey<i>, </i> anytime.

626
00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:42,134
I'm talking about playing.

627
00:39:42,573 --> 00:39:43,039
So am I.

628
00:39:43,441 --> 00:39:44,738
Football! Would you stop it?!

629
00:39:45,676 --> 00:39:48,543
Okay. Alright. You've got about
a week to put a team together

630
00:39:48,846 --> 00:39:51,212
before Mrs. Marsh's deadline.
And then there's the game itself.

631
00:39:52,016 --> 00:39:55,782
No<i>, </i> I don't have a week.
We have a week.

632
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:58,916
Remember we're in this together
right up to your dimples.

633
00:40:00,891 --> 00:40:01,949
Give me some coffee.

634
00:40:06,263 --> 00:40:07,890
Well<i>, </i> how are we going to
recruit these women?

635
00:40:08,199 --> 00:40:08,858
Well<i>, </i> if you're going to go
hunting you've got to go

636
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:10,833
where the prey is.

637
00:40:11,135 --> 00:40:12,864
You mean we have to find a place
where these athletic type

638
00:40:13,104 --> 00:40:14,093
moms hang out?

639
00:40:14,839 --> 00:40:15,237
Hm-huh. Exactly.

640
00:40:16,107 --> 00:40:19,543
Feel the burn. Feel the burn.
Feel the burn. Feel the burn.

641
00:40:20,244 --> 00:40:28,117
One<i>, </i> two<i>, </i> three<i>, </i> four. Breathe in<i>, </i>
breath out. Breathe in.

642
00:40:28,452 --> 00:40:31,751
And elbows up.
Squeeze the beachball!

643
00:40:31,989 --> 00:40:34,253
Squeeze the beachball!
Squeeze the beachball! Squeeze!

644
00:40:34,492 --> 00:40:38,929
Squeeze! Squeeze! Squeeze!
Squeeze! Visualize that you are

645
00:40:39,263 --> 00:40:42,426
firm! Visualize that you are firm!
Visualize! Visualize! Firm!

646
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:46,358
Firm! Firm!
Visualize that you are firm!

647
00:40:52,176 --> 00:40:52,733
Great.

648
00:40:54,411 --> 00:40:55,969
I told you they weren't real.

649
00:41:17,468 --> 00:41:19,561
Okay now<i>, </i> I want you to try and
tackle. Now if you can't don't

650
00:41:19,837 --> 00:41:22,032
worry about it. Just try to keep
your hands on me and hold onto me.

651
00:41:22,473 --> 00:41:25,806
Don't let me run by you. Ready? Okay.

652
00:41:44,528 --> 00:41:45,688
Bag weighed how much?

653
00:41:49,500 --> 00:42:00,968
Good! Good. Very good. Hey<i>, </i>
do you think we're ready for our

654
00:42:01,278 --> 00:42:02,973
workout? You know<i>, </i>
tackling and all that.

655
00:42:04,315 --> 00:42:05,179
We need a quarterback.

656
00:42:05,616 --> 00:42:09,746
Yeah<i>, </i> by tomorrow. Listen<i>, </i>
I got to go pick up Tim.

657
00:42:10,254 --> 00:42:11,983
You think they'd mind if
we knocked off early?

658
00:42:12,223 --> 00:42:13,747
Hey<i>, </i> you guys mind if we
knock off early tonight?

659
00:42:13,958 --> 00:42:15,585
Yeah!

660
00:42:17,628 --> 00:42:20,756
I think they can handle it.
Can I get a ride home?

661
00:42:23,801 --> 00:42:25,701
Nancy<i>, </i> How<i>, </i> come on in.
Pull up a chair.

662
00:42:26,103 --> 00:42:26,967
Make yourself at home.

663
00:42:31,308 --> 00:42:32,297
Mom<i>, </i> we need more bread!

664
00:42:32,543 --> 00:42:33,874
Coming right up!

665
00:43:12,082 --> 00:43:13,515
Okay<i>, </i> Nancy<i>, </i> present your team.

666
00:43:14,718 --> 00:43:20,088
Alright. Joanne Nelson<i>, </i> center.

Oh. Okay.

688
00:45:08,499 --> 00:45:11,400
Shelia you run to where it says
20 on the ground and then stop.

689
00:45:13,003 --> 00:45:14,129
Hut one! Hut two!

00:45:27,618 --> 00:45:28,243
They're alright.

691
00:45:29,053 --> 00:45:30,486
They haven't done anything yet.

692
00:45:31,255 --> 00:45:32,313
They're here<i>, </i> aren't they?

693

That's my mom.
Offensive/defensive tackle.

696
00:45:42,099 --> 00:45:42,861
Mine's the tightend.

697
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:44,524
Too bad we're going to kill 'em.

698
00:45:47,337 --> 00:45:48,201
Hut one. Hey two.

699
00:45:57,748 --> 00:46:05,314
Get your butts over here!
I've decided to take over

700
00:46:05,722 --> 00:46:07,087
coaching you runts for
this mothers/sons thing.

701
00:46:07,858 --> 00:46:09,849
But coach<i>, </i>
what about the varsity team?

702
00:46:11,028 --> 00:46:14,520
Priority<i>, </i> son. Some things are
just more important.

703
00:46:15,265 --> 00:46:19,725
Alright<i>, </i> let's do it again!
Alright! Alright<i>, </i> line up.

704
00:46:20,104 --> 00:46:20,502
Let's go!

705
00:46:24,174 --> 00:46:26,233
Hi. I know it's late but I forgot
to give you your playbook.

706
00:46:27,945 --> 00:46:28,411
Oh<i>, </i> thanks.

707
00:46:32,216 --> 00:46:33,274
Right. Well...

708
00:46:35,886 --> 00:46:36,511
Goodnight.

709
00:46:48,098 --> 00:46:49,565
Hey<i>, </i> good practice today.

710
00:46:50,534 --> 00:46:57,667
Well<i>, </i> yeah. Nice. Earrings<i>, </i> I mean.

711
00:46:58,809 --> 00:47:00,242
My husband gave them to me.

712
00:47:01,345 --> 00:47:01,811
Your husband?

713
00:47:02,346 --> 00:47:03,813
Yeah<i>, </i> you know. The dead one.

714
00:47:04,114 --> 00:47:04,512
Eric.

715
00:47:05,115 --> 00:47:06,173
You never talk about him.

716
00:47:06,917 --> 00:47:10,216
Well<i>, </i> it's not that easy.
You know. It's like talking about

717
00:47:10,687 --> 00:47:13,417
this whole other life.
I wasn't always the town

718
00:47:13,690 --> 00:47:17,922
subversive. I wasn't always a
single parent. Hell<i>, </i>

719
00:47:18,195 --> 00:47:19,628
I single parent. Hell<i>, </i>
I couldn't even find the mayonnaise

720
00:47:19,963 --> 00:47:21,954
in the market. I had to ask every
single time. Look<i>, </i>

721
00:47:24,168 --> 00:47:25,601
it's not your problem.

722
00:47:26,403 --> 00:47:27,870
Man<i>, </i> I was hoping you were
going to say that.

723
00:47:28,438 --> 00:47:30,463
You are such a sensitive guy<i>, </i>
aren't ya?

724
00:47:30,741 --> 00:47:33,301
What I meant was... I think you're
blowing it way out of proportion.

725
00:47:33,810 --> 00:47:36,711
Don't be so hard on yourself
and on everybody else.

726
00:47:38,382 --> 00:47:42,910
Yeah<i>, </i> thanks. Well<i>, </i> I guess I'll
figure out my life some day<i>, </i> huh.

727
00:47:44,922 --> 00:47:50,224
Maybe you already have.
Well<i>, </i> it's late.

728
00:47:53,630 --> 00:47:54,927
I should go in.

729
00:47:55,432 --> 00:47:56,194
I'll see you tomorrow.

730
00:47:56,567 --> 00:47:57,932
Okay. Goodnight.

731
00:47:58,268 --> 00:47:58,825
Bye.

732
00:48:17,588 --> 00:48:18,714
Hey<i>, </i> I heard you're coaching
the sons now.

733
00:48:19,156 --> 00:48:21,420
You heard right.
That your play book?

734
00:48:21,725 --> 00:48:22,123
Yeah.

735
00:48:23,193 --> 00:48:23,682
This is mine.

736
00:48:24,328 --> 00:48:26,421
You know what they say<i>, </i> Jimbo...
size doesn't matter.

737
00:48:26,830 --> 00:48:28,422
It's what you do with it that counts.

738
00:48:35,372 --> 00:48:37,840
Alright ladies<i>, </i> let's get up now.
Let's work on some blocking.

739
00:48:38,442 --> 00:48:40,910
We'll start out with the offensive
line. Now line up.

740
00:48:41,478 --> 00:48:44,413
Go ahead and line up and run a
play. Let's see how you do.

741
00:48:47,618 --> 00:48:50,052
Okay<i>, </i> ready? Hut one! Hut two!

742
00:48:52,189 --> 00:48:55,886
Okay<i>, </i> that's it. Alright.
Nancy<i>, </i> come here. Listen<i>, </i>

743
00:48:56,260 --> 00:48:58,125
that's real good but there's a
couple of things we've got to do

744
00:48:58,395 --> 00:48:58,884
a little bit different.
I'm gonna be you this play<i>, </i>

745
00:48:59,196 --> 00:49:02,654
alright. You did a good job.
I want you to watch me.

746
00:49:02,899 --> 00:49:04,867
Listen<i>, </i> each of us has a man
across from us<i>, </i> right?

747
00:49:05,302 --> 00:49:05,597
Right.

748
00:49:05,869 --> 00:49:08,360
Keep that men from out away from
the quarterback. Keep her outta

749
00:49:08,438 --> 00:49:13,967
there no matter what.
Go ahead and play.

750
00:49:16,813 --> 00:49:17,438
Hut one! Hut two!

751
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:24,815
Okay<i>, </i> that's great!
That's great. See?

752
00:49:42,973 --> 00:49:43,462
I felt great.

753
00:49:43,940 --> 00:49:47,307
So honey<i>, </i>
is Howard getting cuter or what?

754
00:49:47,611 --> 00:49:49,340
Oh Howard's definitely
getting cuter.

755
00:49:49,713 --> 00:49:52,011
Would you look at my hands.
I mean<i>, </i> I used to have fingernails.

756
00:49:52,916 --> 00:49:54,213
And what is the deal with this rash?

757
00:49:54,718 --> 00:49:55,514
Bra burn.

758
00:49:55,819 --> 00:49:56,808
Is that like jock itch?

759
00:49:57,287 --> 00:49:58,049
What is jock itch?

760
00:49:58,355 --> 00:50:00,084
It's really gross.
You really want to know?

761
00:50:00,290 --> 00:50:01,416
No!

762
00:50:02,559 --> 00:50:07,861
So Nanc<i>, </i>
what do you think of Howard?

763
00:50:08,598 --> 00:50:09,360
Oooooh!

764
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:11,495
Whoo-whoo-whoo!

765
00:50:11,802 --> 00:50:14,362
Oh<i>, </i> what do I think of him or what
do I want the whole town to know?

766
00:50:18,909 --> 00:50:21,207
Excuse me<i>, </i> guys<i>, </i>
but I am not a gossips.

767
00:50:22,379 --> 00:50:24,973
No but what about like<i>, </i>
a big blabber mouth?

768
00:50:25,382 --> 00:50:26,076
Or maybe busy body?

769
00:50:26,350 --> 00:50:27,078
Or chatterbox?

770
00:50:29,519 --> 00:50:30,213
You forgot yenta.

771
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:52,499
Oh wow<i>, </i> they look great.

772
00:50:53,610 --> 00:50:59,606
They don't move. I mean<i>, </i>
they move but... they don't jiggle.

773
00:51:00,517 --> 00:51:05,614
Well<i>, </i> they sort of jiggle but
it's like a uni-jiggle.

774
00:51:06,423 --> 00:51:07,856
Was I right or was I right. Whoo!

775
00:51:20,437 --> 00:51:20,926
Goodnight.

776
00:51:21,905 --> 00:51:23,202
Does this make any sense to you?

777
00:51:28,111 --> 00:51:32,377
Ahh... yeah<i>, </i>
it's the Statue Of Liberty play.

778
00:51:33,183 --> 00:51:35,117
Oh. Of course.

779
00:51:36,987 --> 00:51:38,113
You know what these are<i>, </i> right?

780
00:51:38,455 --> 00:51:42,289
Hugs and kisses? Oh<i>, </i> I know.
It's the offensive and

781
00:51:42,692 --> 00:51:43,750
defensive alinements.

782
00:51:44,060 --> 00:51:47,029
Right. So your quarterback drops
back like he's gonna...

783
00:51:47,898 --> 00:51:49,297
she's gonna make a pass...

784
00:51:49,466 --> 00:51:51,127
You know your birthday's
coming up next week.

785
00:51:52,068 --> 00:51:53,763
I thought you wanted to
talk about this play.

786
00:51:54,104 --> 00:51:55,036
What should we do?

787
00:51:56,907 --> 00:51:57,874
Ignore it.

788
00:51:58,141 --> 00:52:02,441
I was in labor for 47 hours.
This is not a day I ignore.

789
00:52:02,712 --> 00:52:08,651
You owe me. Besides<i>, </i> remember how
your dad used be no birthdays.

790
00:52:08,952 --> 00:52:11,182
Could we not do this<i>, </i> please.

791
00:52:11,955 --> 00:52:15,118
Well<i>, </i> I just thought we'd do
something special. You know you

792
00:52:15,225 --> 00:52:20,629
could invite anybody you want.
Joe. Betsy. For example.

793
00:52:21,998 --> 00:52:23,260
I don't want anything.

794
00:52:24,034 --> 00:52:27,094
Okay<i>, </i> so no parades and no
fireworks. It'll just be me and

795
00:52:27,938 --> 00:52:30,338
you. I know.
I'll make you some tuna casserole.

796
00:52:31,174 --> 00:52:31,663
No.

797
00:52:33,076 --> 00:52:33,770
Some Ramaki.

798
00:52:34,277 --> 00:52:34,800
No!

799
00:52:40,417 --> 00:52:41,782
You know I love you<i>, </i> honey.

800
00:52:45,188 --> 00:52:45,813
I know.

801
00:52:59,970 --> 00:53:02,495
Alright<i>, </i> ladies. When I call off
your names you come up and I'll

802
00:53:02,706 --> 00:53:03,502
give you your jerseys.

803
00:53:04,608 --> 00:53:06,735
And after that Mr. Brooks will get
you the rest of your gear.

804
00:53:08,512 --> 00:53:10,309
Foster<i>, </i> 72.

805
00:53:11,047 --> 00:53:14,312
Yeah. Alright. Anderson<i>, </i> 75.

806
00:53:18,688 --> 00:53:22,488
Oh<i>, </i> sorry I'm late.
Here are the comps you wanted.

807
00:53:22,792 --> 00:53:24,419
Oh<i>, </i> why didn't you give
them to the client.

808
00:53:24,928 --> 00:53:26,327
Oh<i>, </i> you're the agent.

809
00:53:27,097 --> 00:53:27,995
You could be.

810
00:53:29,633 --> 00:53:32,500
Oh<i>, </i> I couldn't. Harry wouldn't
want me to be out of the house...

811
00:53:32,869 --> 00:53:35,030
Forget about him. We're talking
about you now and your life.

812
00:53:37,908 --> 00:53:38,567
I'm afraid.

813
00:53:39,876 --> 00:53:40,240
Oh what?

814
00:53:41,578 --> 00:53:45,014
Of failing. I mean<i>, </i> what would
people think if I don't do well?

815
00:53:45,382 --> 00:53:50,183
Who cares? You've gotta over that.
You know<i>, </i> you can't go living

816
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:53,086
your life based on what other
people think. There's always gonna

817
00:53:53,590 --> 00:53:55,353
be people who like you and people
who don't. You just have to be

818
00:53:55,859 --> 00:53:58,157
yourself and take it from there.

819
00:54:04,601 --> 00:54:05,727
Seaver<i>, </i> 89!

820
00:54:15,612 --> 00:54:17,637
I appreciate the fact
that you know what...

821
00:54:19,282 --> 00:54:22,308
you could have said...

822
00:54:27,457 --> 00:54:27,923
Mrs. Seaver?

823
00:54:28,091 --> 00:54:28,887
Do you think that... What?

824
00:54:29,225 --> 00:54:30,624
Telephone. It's over there.

825
00:54:30,994 --> 00:54:31,426
Alright<i>, </i> thanks.

826
00:54:31,828 --> 00:54:34,023
See you later<i>, </i> Nanc.

827
00:54:36,633 --> 00:54:41,900
Hello. Oh<i>, </i> Hi<i>, </i> Maryann.
Where are you? No.

828
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:47,171
No<i>, </i> you're right.
Chicken pox is much more serious

829
00:54:47,510 --> 00:54:50,809
when you're an adult.
You just feel better okay. Bye.

830
00:55:01,324 --> 00:55:01,915
You heard.

831
00:55:02,759 --> 00:55:04,283
I happened to be standing there.

832
00:55:04,861 --> 00:55:05,190
Right.

833
00:55:05,729 --> 00:55:07,424
So<i>, </i> football game's off.

834
00:55:08,698 --> 00:55:13,192
Well<i>, </i> Nancy<i>, </i> can't you get someone
to take Maryann's place?

835
00:55:14,938 --> 00:55:17,873
You know I have already asked
every mom in this town.

836
00:55:18,108 --> 00:55:21,100
Every mom? I beg your pardon you
have not asked me.

837
00:55:21,811 --> 00:55:24,336
Of course<i>, </i> no one every asks me
to do anything. Ever!

838
00:55:24,681 --> 00:55:28,208
Not a cup of coffee.
Not a party. Not a-a lunch.

839
00:55:28,885 --> 00:55:29,317
Ann.

840
00:55:29,653 --> 00:55:32,087
All I do is work.
Work<i>, </i> work<i>, </i> work<i>, </i> work.

841
00:55:32,522 --> 00:55:35,582
And what do I get in return?
Zero<i>, </i> zilch<i>, </i> nada.

842
00:55:36,526 --> 00:55:39,154
I just want people to like me.
Why don't they like me?

843
00:55:40,497 --> 00:55:43,466
Well<i>, </i> could it be you've got a
tendency to overdo everything.

844
00:55:44,067 --> 00:55:50,233
Charge of everything.
The PTA<i>, </i> Quail Fan Club.

845
00:55:50,740 --> 00:55:53,072
Well<i>, </i> you're lucky.
Your husband died.

846
00:55:53,276 --> 00:55:55,904
Gee<i>, </i> I knew I was looking at
this whole thing the wrong way.

847
00:55:55,945 --> 00:55:58,937
I don't mean it like that.
My husband walked out on me.

848
00:55:59,649 --> 00:56:02,140
Do you know how many hours I
filled up wondering what I did

849
00:56:02,485 --> 00:56:06,615
wrong. I wasn't sexy enough.
I wasn't funny enough.

850
00:56:07,057 --> 00:56:08,752
I wasn't pretty enough.
I wasn't smart enough.

851
00:56:08,958 --> 00:56:17,696
I wasn't enough. It's funny<i>, </i>
isn't it? I've been trying so

852
00:56:18,168 --> 00:56:20,932
hard to get everyone accept me
I made everyone hate me.

853
00:56:21,237 --> 00:56:24,035
Nobody hates you<i>, </i> Ann.
You just kind of wear us all out.

854
00:56:27,877 --> 00:56:31,074
Well<i>, </i> maybe it's time you put some
of that energy to some good use.

855
00:56:36,252 --> 00:56:39,085
Actually it would be but it's not.
It's perfect.

856
00:56:40,857 --> 00:56:46,625
Ah ladies! Excuse me. And Howard.
Okay<i>, </i> I've got good news and bad

857
00:56:47,130 --> 00:56:51,863
news. First the bad news.
Um<i>, </i> Maryann had the chicken pox.

858
00:56:53,236 --> 00:56:54,100
Are you serious?

859
00:56:54,404 --> 00:56:55,701
That means we don't have a team.

860
00:56:56,039 --> 00:56:58,030
No. See<i>, </i> you're always jumping
to the wrong conclusions.

861
00:56:58,675 --> 00:57:02,406
The good news is I got
us a replacement.

862
00:57:09,319 --> 00:57:10,650
Alright!

863
00:57:11,321 --> 00:57:17,157
Great. That's great<i>, </i> Ann.

864
00:57:20,230 --> 00:57:20,889
Okay<i>, </i> you guys.

865
00:57:21,498 --> 00:57:24,126
Nancy<i>, </i> thank you so much.
It was so much fun.

866
00:57:31,374 --> 00:57:32,272
What to have lunch with us?

867
00:57:32,575 --> 00:57:33,098
No<i>, </i> I've got to go home and
make dinner for the kids.

868
00:57:33,977 --> 00:57:34,443
Okay<i>, </i> see ya.

869
00:57:34,811 --> 00:57:36,403
Okay. Bye-bye.

870
00:57:41,851 --> 00:57:42,840
You need a ride?

871
00:57:45,555 --> 00:57:47,386
Boy<i>, </i> you really like to cook<i>, </i>
don't you?

872
00:57:47,891 --> 00:57:48,619
Hey<i>, </i> I like to eat.

873
00:57:49,025 --> 00:57:50,356
Yeah but Chinese is really hard.

874
00:57:51,127 --> 00:57:52,424
Not once you get the hang of it.

875
00:57:52,862 --> 00:57:53,260
Why?

876
00:57:53,730 --> 00:57:55,595
Well<i>, </i> all the chopping takes about...

877
00:57:55,832 --> 00:57:56,856
How come you're not married?

878
00:57:57,901 --> 00:57:59,459
Go ahead<i>, </i> ask me something personal.

879
00:58:00,203 --> 00:58:01,465
Hey<i>, </i> you're blushing.

880
00:58:02,372 --> 00:58:03,270
Go sit out there.

881
00:58:06,676 --> 00:58:09,372
Oh<i>, </i> so now it all makes sense.

882
00:58:09,679 --> 00:58:10,338
What does?

883
00:58:11,548 --> 00:58:15,245
Why you never got married and
why you became Vice-principal

884
00:58:15,752 --> 00:58:19,779
instead of Principal. Why you let
Coach Cox push you around.

885
00:58:20,156 --> 00:58:21,589
Hey<i>, </i> I like being Vice-principal.

886
00:58:22,792 --> 00:58:25,124
That accident sure changed your
life<i>, </i> didn't it?

887
00:58:25,428 --> 00:58:28,397
No<i>, </i> it just just your life and
your whole future.

888
00:58:28,932 --> 00:58:29,899
It wasn't that big a deal.

889
00:58:30,300 --> 00:58:31,164
Tttt.

890
00:58:31,601 --> 00:58:32,499
How do you know?

891
00:58:34,537 --> 00:58:36,095
I guess I don't.

892
00:58:38,007 --> 00:58:40,908
I'm sorry. It's just that I've
heard that I've heard that

893
00:58:41,411 --> 00:58:42,400
I could been a contender' talk
my whole adult life.

894
00:58:42,979 --> 00:58:47,040
And you wanna know a secret?
I wasn't that good.

895
00:58:47,584 --> 00:58:49,779
What about the scout and
the scholarship?

896
00:58:50,086 --> 00:58:53,055
Pipe dreams. That injury got me
off the hook. With my family<i>, </i>

897
00:58:53,356 --> 00:58:55,688
with my school.
With this whole damn town.

898
00:58:56,059 --> 00:58:58,527
I didn't let anyone down.
I didn't disappoint anyone.

899
00:58:58,862 --> 00:59:01,160
I broke my leg. End of story.
No more hero.

900
00:59:01,865 --> 00:59:03,025
I got to just be a guy.

901
00:59:05,602 --> 00:59:07,035
And a very good Vice-principal.

902
00:59:08,504 --> 00:59:09,061
Yeah.

903
00:59:12,275 --> 00:59:14,436
So now that you know my deepest
darkest secrets maybe you'll go

904
00:59:14,677 --> 00:59:15,666
out with me sometime.

905
00:59:16,412 --> 00:59:20,348
Out? You mean like a date?
Because<i>, </i> I mean<i>, </i> if it's like a

906
00:59:21,351 --> 00:59:25,048
date date kind of thing<i>, </i> oh man<i>, </i>
I really... I don't think so.

907
00:59:25,855 --> 00:59:28,153
But then if it's just like a
friend. Get together<i>, </i>

908
00:59:28,524 --> 00:59:30,082
no pressure kind of thing.
Then<i>, </i> you know<i>, </i>

909
00:59:30,360 --> 00:59:31,349
I-I think that's okay.

910
00:59:31,928 --> 00:59:33,691
Fine. Hey<i>, </i> if it makes you
feel any better you can pay.

911
00:59:33,930 --> 00:59:37,366
Okay. No<i>, </i> wait.

912
00:59:37,767 --> 00:59:38,859
Hey<i>, </i> thanks for the ride.

913
00:59:39,903 --> 00:59:42,303
Can we go back to the part
about where I pay?

914
00:59:42,805 --> 00:59:43,499
Goodnight<i>, </i> Nanc.

915
00:59:46,309 --> 00:59:47,241
Goodnight.

916
00:59:56,986 --> 00:59:58,010
Hut one! Hut one!

917
00:59:59,255 --> 01:00:00,654
Go<i>, </i> go<i>, </i> go!

918
01:00:03,059 --> 01:00:04,321
I see your mom plays better
than you do.

919
01:00:04,694 --> 01:00:05,456
Ha-ha.

920
01:00:06,029 --> 01:00:06,688
Alright. Good job!

921
01:00:08,197 --> 01:00:09,562
You know<i>, </i> Coach<i>, </i>
they're not that bad.

922
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:11,799
Maybe you'd like to play with 'em<i>, </i>
Dooley.

923
01:00:12,268 --> 01:00:13,257
Hut one! Hut two!

924
01:00:13,970 --> 01:00:16,564
Whoo!

925
01:00:20,743 --> 01:00:24,201
Good job. Alright<i>, </i> here we go.
Get back on the line now.

926
01:00:25,481 --> 01:00:28,882
So<i>, </i> we'll face it.
It's not the Taj Mahal but they<i>, </i>

927
01:00:29,285 --> 01:00:32,049
it's a steal. All you have to do
is use a little bit of imagination.

928
01:00:32,288 --> 01:00:35,189
Okay<i>, </i> like this ugly wall back
here. That's ugly right?

929
01:00:35,525 --> 01:00:36,150
It is ugly.

930
01:00:36,526 --> 01:00:38,619
So you could just get somebody to
paint like a mural on it.

931
01:00:39,095 --> 01:00:41,825
You know<i>, </i> I was thinking something
very early Grand Canyon.

932
01:00:43,032 --> 01:00:43,521
What do you think?

933
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:45,092
Grand Canyon will work.

934
01:00:45,335 --> 01:00:48,361
Why don't you go out there and
take a look. Oh. But before you do.

935
01:00:49,505 --> 01:00:53,100
Listen. Trust me.
You are going to need this.

936
01:01:07,423 --> 01:01:07,889
Hi<i>, </i> Tim.

937
01:01:08,858 --> 01:01:09,381
Bets.

938
01:01:12,161 --> 01:01:12,684
Yeah?

939
01:01:14,764 --> 01:01:19,599
Ah<i>, </i> nothing. Are you going home?

940
01:01:21,070 --> 01:01:23,038
That usually happens after school.

941
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:27,073
Right. Right<i>, </i> that makes sense.

942
01:01:28,378 --> 01:01:29,345
Glad I could help out.

943
01:01:30,613 --> 01:01:34,310
Um<i>, </i> see<i>, </i> I was wondering since we
live so close to each other.

944
01:01:35,018 --> 01:01:39,546
I thought maybe I could sort of
walk you home or walk home with

945
01:01:39,789 --> 01:01:41,222
you or we could walk together.

946
01:01:41,524 --> 01:01:43,389
I'd like that.

947
01:01:43,960 --> 01:01:44,824
Wanna go?

948
01:01:45,928 --> 01:01:59,672
Are we going to go to your
house now or what?

949
01:02:00,543 --> 01:02:03,239
Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah<i>, </i> yeah.
Yeah. Sure.

950
01:03:07,343 --> 01:03:12,713
Hi<i>, </i> Nancy. Come on in. So<i>, </i>
Nancy<i>, </i> can you stay?

951
01:03:12,982 --> 01:03:14,643
No. And neither can Tim.

952
01:03:15,284 --> 01:03:16,342
Mrs. Dooley bought a cake.

953
01:03:16,919 --> 01:03:17,408
Let's go.

954
01:03:18,955 --> 01:03:19,512
It's just a party.

955
01:03:20,089 --> 01:03:30,329
This isn't your family!
Come on Tim<i>, </i> you come home with me.

956
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:32,059
No.

957
01:03:37,306 --> 01:03:38,102
No<i>, </i> I want you to come here.

958
01:03:39,842 --> 01:03:43,801
Who do you think you are to treat
me like this?! Oh<i>, </i>

959
01:03:44,113 --> 01:03:46,775
you don't want to talk. Fine!
Cause I've got stuff to say anyway.

960
01:03:47,350 --> 01:03:50,842
Number one! I don't want you
eating at the Dooley's anymore!

961
01:03:51,454 --> 01:03:54,753
This your home<i>, </i> you get the
picture! And I don't want you

962
01:03:55,057 --> 01:03:56,888
to ignore me like I'm some sort
of leper or something.

963
01:03:57,260 --> 01:04:00,889
I am your mother!!
And it is not a take it or leave

964
01:04:01,197 --> 01:04:05,531
it proposition. You owe me some
respect. And finally<i>, </i>

965
01:04:05,868 --> 01:04:08,200
if you ever pull the kind of crap
that you pulled over there tonight...

966
01:04:08,404 --> 01:04:09,268
I got it<i>, </i> alright. Now lay off!

967
01:04:09,772 --> 01:04:12,434
Now<i>, </i> I'm not going to pretend like
everything's back to normal again

968
01:04:12,742 --> 01:04:14,039
because it isn't! And it hasn't
been ever since your dad died!

969
01:04:15,044 --> 01:04:16,671
Oh<i>, </i> I'm not going to talk about this.

970
01:04:16,946 --> 01:04:17,776
You need to talk about it!

971
01:04:17,947 --> 01:04:18,436
No we don't!

972
01:04:18,614 --> 01:04:19,137
You have to!

973
01:04:19,415 --> 01:04:19,847
I can't!

974
01:04:20,950 --> 01:04:32,828
Because it hurts! Alright?!
It hurts too much.

975
01:04:38,267 --> 01:04:39,859
I didn't ever get to say good-bye.

976
01:04:46,042 --> 01:04:59,911
Don't you think I know?
Don't you think I'm feeling

977
01:05:00,256 --> 01:05:05,421
everything that you're feeling?
One day the man I've lived

978
01:05:05,695 --> 01:05:09,358
with for 15 years leaves for work
and the next thing I know some

979
01:05:09,699 --> 01:05:13,157
drunk driver makes a wrong turn
and I'm at the hospital collecting

980
01:05:13,502 --> 01:05:18,201
his watch and his ring and his
wallet in some plastic bag.

981
01:05:22,278 --> 01:05:23,336
It will never be the same.

982
01:05:26,549 --> 01:05:35,048
We're not the same.
I can't be mom and dad.

983
01:05:35,458 --> 01:05:37,722
And you can't go over to the
Dooley's hoping they'll adopt you.

984
01:05:40,396 --> 01:05:47,666
I know. I love you<i>, </i> Mom.

985
01:05:50,206 --> 01:05:54,370
I know you do. I love you too.

986
01:06:02,218 --> 01:06:02,809
Nancy?

987
01:06:04,120 --> 01:06:08,079
Can we still do something
for my birthday?

988
01:06:08,157 --> 01:06:10,091
Yeah<i>, </i> well<i>, </i>
I thought of a few things.

989
01:06:11,894 --> 01:06:14,590
But<i>, </i> what do you want to do?

990
01:06:18,501 --> 01:06:22,403
I am dying for some Mexican food.
Ever since we left L.A.

991
01:06:22,938 --> 01:06:24,565
There's that little place right
outside of town.

992
01:06:25,775 --> 01:06:36,982
Let's go. Okay<i>, </i> hold on a minute.
I'll go get my purse.

993
01:06:37,420 --> 01:06:38,751
I'll be right back.

994
01:06:55,705 --> 01:06:58,333
Okay ladies<i>, </i> let's talk about
some penalties. Nanc<i>, </i> up.

995
01:07:01,944 --> 01:07:05,004
First of all<i>, </i> clipping.
Clipping is blocking from behind.

996
01:07:06,315 --> 01:07:08,613
You can't do that.
Second of all<i>, </i> off sides.

997
01:07:09,151 --> 01:07:12,882
Crossing the line of scrimmage
before the ball is hiked.

998
01:07:13,055 --> 01:07:16,456
You can't do that either.
Now my personal favorite...

999
01:07:16,792 --> 01:07:18,589
holding. You try and run by me.

1000
01:07:19,428 --> 01:07:19,757
Okay.

1001
01:07:21,997 --> 01:07:22,793
That's holding.

1002
01:07:23,132 --> 01:07:25,293
Okay. You better quit before you
get to illegal use of the hands.

1003
01:07:31,140 --> 01:07:33,335
And now for a little defense.
Stripping the ball.

1004
01:07:33,843 --> 01:07:35,970
Sometimes when you tackle someone
you just don't want to tackle

1005
01:07:36,145 --> 01:07:38,010
them you want to get the ball
loose. Cause a fumble.

1006
01:07:38,814 --> 01:07:43,478
Give me that ball.
Let's do this in slow motion.

1007
01:07:43,686 --> 01:07:47,213
You come at me. Slow motion.
I'll strip the ball. Watch me.

1008
01:07:48,591 --> 01:07:50,218
Aaah<i>, </i> okay.

1009
01:07:58,267 --> 01:07:59,996
A very effective move.

1010
01:08:12,114 --> 01:08:12,739
You going out?

1011
01:08:13,249 --> 01:08:13,772
With Betsy.

1012
01:08:15,084 --> 01:08:16,176
Like on a date?

1013
01:08:16,819 --> 01:08:19,185
Maybe. You? Howard?

1014
01:08:19,655 --> 01:08:20,280
Maybe.

1015
01:08:23,692 --> 01:08:42,840
Tim! Hey<i>, </i> Tim<i>, </i> do you wanna a
ride?! No! Too geeky? No. No<i>, </i>

1016
01:08:45,881 --> 01:08:50,841
you look just like...
you look very handsome.

1017
01:08:53,022 --> 01:08:54,319
You look okay too.

1018
01:08:54,857 --> 01:08:57,382
Yeah.
You mean for someone my size.

1019
01:08:57,993 --> 01:09:01,986
No<i>, </i> I don't. Short and beautiful
like the perfect day.

1020
01:09:02,298 --> 01:09:03,856
That's what dad always said.

1021
01:09:04,133 --> 01:09:12,404
Well<i>, </i> he meant big and difficult.
You know your dad never cared

1022
01:09:12,808 --> 01:09:16,505
about my size or what I said or
who I ticked off and<i>, </i> in fact<i>, </i>

1023
01:09:16,812 --> 01:09:18,643
I ticked off and<i>, </i> in fact<i>, </i>
I think he loved me because of

1024
01:09:18,981 --> 01:09:21,950
those things. You know that I
really loved him too<i>, </i> right?

1025
01:09:23,352 --> 01:09:26,116
Is this some weird way of working
up a mom/son talk about Howard?

1026
01:09:26,722 --> 01:09:33,457
No. Well<i>, </i> yeah<i>, </i> maybe. I mean<i>, </i>
even it's not Howard it could be

1027
01:09:33,929 --> 01:09:36,762
some guy. And I just want to make
sure that you're okay about all

1028
01:09:37,166 --> 01:09:43,867
this. Well<i>, </i> what do you think your
dad would think about this game

1029
01:09:44,039 --> 01:09:45,097
on Saturday?

1030
01:09:46,242 --> 01:09:48,210
Same as always.
Mom's doing a Lucy Ricardo.

1031
01:09:48,844 --> 01:09:49,811
He never said that.

1032
01:09:50,045 --> 01:09:51,034
Sure he did. All the time.

1033
01:09:52,014 --> 01:09:55,279
Come on. I don't believe it!
Lucy? He was Lucy.

1034
01:09:56,919 --> 01:09:59,387
Now are you sure that you're okay
about Mr. Peterman<i>, </i> you know<i>, </i>

1035
01:09:59,955 --> 01:10:01,115
Howard and me?

1036
01:10:01,490 --> 01:10:04,550
Nanc<i>, </i> I heard what you said.
Lighten up. It's okay.

1037
01:10:04,927 --> 01:10:06,155
Wreck him.

1038
01:10:12,535 --> 01:10:14,765
What happened to dinner?
Movie? Bowling?

1039
01:10:15,237 --> 01:10:17,102
Well<i>, </i> I just want to be
ready for Saturday.

1040
01:10:17,873 --> 01:10:19,670
You're ready.
It's not like it's the Superbowl.

1041
01:10:20,376 --> 01:10:21,400
I don't want to blow it.

1042
01:10:21,777 --> 01:10:22,368
You won't.

1043
01:10:23,045 --> 01:10:25,605
How come you're always doing all
this positive thinking stuff?

1044
01:10:26,015 --> 01:10:27,880
It's an ugly job but
someone's gotta do it.

1045
01:10:28,684 --> 01:10:29,651
I can think positive.

1046
01:10:30,386 --> 01:10:30,750
Right.

1047
01:10:31,053 --> 01:10:31,542
I can!

1048
01:10:32,555 --> 01:10:32,987
Like?

1049
01:10:34,023 --> 01:10:40,895
Okay<i>, </i> like... this place.
I'm starting to like here.

1050
01:10:41,196 --> 01:10:42,254
This town? Your home?

1051
01:10:43,232 --> 01:10:49,660
Yeah... my home. That sound cool<i>, </i>
doesn't it? My home. My town.

1052
01:10:51,540 --> 01:10:52,097
Your town.

1053
01:10:54,043 --> 01:10:59,913
You know um<i>, </i> Eric<i>, </i> my husband<i>, </i>
he was really a great guy.

1054
01:11:01,050 --> 01:11:02,881
I really loved him.
Everybody really loved him.

1055
01:11:03,352 --> 01:11:06,651
And what could be better than
being Mrs. Great Guy. But this...

1056
01:11:07,456 --> 01:11:18,264
I did this. I moved here.
I made new friends.

1057
01:11:18,934 --> 01:11:22,233
I'm raising my son al hell<i>, </i>
I even got a job.

1058
01:11:24,306 --> 01:11:27,605
Nobody told me how to do it.
I did it all by myself.

1059
01:11:28,344 --> 01:11:37,912
Me. Me. Me.

1060
01:11:39,221 --> 01:11:40,051
Pretty gutsy.

1061
01:11:40,456 --> 01:11:44,825
You're damn straight it was gutsy.
I mean<i>, </i> I miss Eric and

1062
01:11:45,094 --> 01:11:47,062
everything but I never would have
had the guts to do anything

1063
01:11:47,329 --> 01:11:48,296
like this before.

1064
01:11:48,631 --> 01:11:49,063
Probably not.

1065
01:11:49,798 --> 01:11:51,425
You know what I'm finding out though?

1066
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:51,895
What?

1067
01:11:52,134 --> 01:11:56,730
It's just like<i>, </i> you solve one
problem and then another one comes

1068
01:11:57,039 --> 01:12:01,203
along. There's never really any
end to it. There's never time

1069
01:12:01,543 --> 01:12:06,310
either. But<i>, </i> you know what the
beauty of it is?

1070
01:12:06,582 --> 01:12:09,847
At least now when I make a mistake
I know it is mine.

1071
01:12:12,321 --> 01:12:14,482
You're on a roll.
You're happening.

1072
01:12:14,990 --> 01:12:17,458
You're the queen bee. Head honcho.
Big cheese. Top dog.

1073
01:12:17,860 --> 01:12:20,351
You've got it all figured out<i>, </i>
don't you?

1074
01:12:20,596 --> 01:12:21,255
Yeah.

1075
01:12:21,797 --> 01:12:25,858
Me<i>, </i> me<i>, </i> me and a little bit more
me and that's all you need.

1076
01:12:28,303 --> 01:12:29,827
That's all I need too.

1077
01:12:33,976 --> 01:12:36,376
Well<i>, </i> did anybody ever tell you
you do have a really cute smile?

1078
01:12:38,347 --> 01:12:39,245
It's the overbite<i>, </i> right?

1079
01:12:39,748 --> 01:12:50,283
Yeah. Chicks dig that. Howard.

1080
01:12:52,061 --> 01:12:52,857
Damn kids.

1081
01:13:04,940 --> 01:13:08,899
D-d-d-e-v... I-i...

1082
01:13:10,112 --> 01:13:10,441
How's it go?

1083
01:13:10,946 --> 01:13:14,006
Will you just calm down.
Hold your breath.

1084
01:13:15,317 --> 01:13:16,511
My breath or my breast?

1085
01:13:16,652 --> 01:13:19,849
Feels like my last mammogram.
OH! Are you suppose to do that?

1086
01:13:20,556 --> 01:13:23,116
This is killing me.
I can't believe guys do this

1087
01:13:23,258 --> 01:13:30,994
all the time. Ahh...
Anybody have any mascara?

1088
01:13:32,167 --> 01:13:32,724
Wait a minute.

1089
01:13:33,302 --> 01:13:33,734
Need some help?

1090
01:13:33,869 --> 01:13:35,632
Yeah. Ah! Ah! Ahhh!

1091
01:13:36,338 --> 01:13:39,967
Hey... hey<i>, </i> this looks pretty good.

1092
01:13:40,743 --> 01:13:44,008
Hey Nanc<i>, </i> I saw you last night
working out.

1093
01:13:45,581 --> 01:13:48,414
So now I suppose the whole
town knows<i>, </i> right?

1094
01:13:49,718 --> 01:13:53,620
Well actually ah<i>, </i>
I haven't said a word to anyone.

1095
01:13:53,956 --> 01:13:54,615
You haven't?

1096
01:13:55,023 --> 01:13:56,581
Hey<i>, </i> it's nobody else's business<i>, </i>
right?

1097
01:13:58,494 --> 01:13:59,051
Right.

1098
01:14:03,132 --> 01:14:05,965
Okay<i>, </i> ladies<i>, </i> huddle up! Look<i>, </i>
the game's gonna start in a

1099
01:14:06,201 --> 01:14:06,633
couple of minutes.

1100
01:14:07,069 --> 01:14:08,434
Oh goodie<i>, </i> our first pep talk.

1101
01:14:09,571 --> 01:14:11,766
I know you worked hard and you
deserve to win but if you don't

1102
01:14:12,074 --> 01:14:14,907
it doesn't matter. We're still
gonna go out for pizza and beer

1103
01:14:15,244 --> 01:14:16,268
afterwards anyway.

1104
01:14:16,979 --> 01:14:18,879
And anyway winning is not important.

1105
01:14:19,248 --> 01:14:20,374
It's how you play the game.

1106
01:14:20,749 --> 01:14:23,445
No. It's believing in yourself
that counts.

1107
01:14:24,720 --> 01:14:27,985
So let's go out and have some fun.
And now I think your coach might

1108
01:14:28,323 --> 01:14:30,484
have a few words of inspiration.

1109
01:14:30,559 --> 01:14:38,432
Yeah<i>, </i> okay. Okay. Well<i>, </i>
I do have one announcement.

1110
01:14:39,268 --> 01:14:43,102
Right now<i>, </i> as of this moment<i>, </i>
I'm quitting as coach.

1111
01:14:43,806 --> 01:14:44,135
What?

1112
01:14:45,073 --> 01:14:45,767
Because...

1113
01:14:48,043 --> 01:14:50,375
Aaah...

1114
01:14:53,115 --> 01:14:55,140
You know you've been calling the
shots all along anyway so this

1115
01:14:55,384 --> 01:14:58,182
just kind of makes it official.
But forget that crap he said

1116
01:14:58,587 --> 01:15:00,817
about winning's not important.
Let's get out there and show them

1117
01:15:01,156 --> 01:15:03,784
we're a bunch of tough mothers!

1118
01:15:07,596 --> 01:15:10,793
Moth-ers! Moth-ers!
Moth-ers! Moth-ers!

1119
01:15:14,169 --> 01:15:14,897
What are we gonna do?

1120
01:15:14,937 --> 01:15:15,869
Kill 'em!

1121
01:15:16,438 --> 01:15:17,132
I can't hear you!

1122
01:15:18,106 --> 01:15:18,629
Kill'em!

1123
01:15:20,209 --> 01:15:21,141
This is getting kind of sick.

1124
01:15:23,111 --> 01:15:29,107
Devils do it... gotta get get get
to it! Devils do it...

1125
01:15:29,451 --> 01:15:32,318
gotta get get get to it!
Devils do it...

1126
01:15:32,821 --> 01:15:33,446
gotta get get get to it.

1127
01:15:33,956 --> 01:15:36,015
We're the mothers<i>, </i>
we're the mothers rah-rah-rah!

1128
01:15:36,692 --> 01:15:38,455
We're the mothers<i>, </i>
we're the mothers sis-boom-ba!

1129
01:15:39,094 --> 01:15:39,890
Ricka-racka firecracker<i>, </i>
rah-rah-rah! We're the mothers<i>, </i>

1130
01:15:40,896 --> 01:15:46,391
we're the mothers sis-boom ba!

1131
01:16:05,754 --> 01:16:06,652
Man<i>, </i> hey look mean.

1132
01:16:08,257 --> 01:16:09,485
Look<i>, </i> the jiggle up and down.

1133
01:16:09,858 --> 01:16:11,223
Good luck to ya.

1134
01:16:16,832 --> 01:16:22,031
Yeah. Play your best.

1135
01:16:35,117 --> 01:16:35,446
That's my earring.

1136
01:16:36,218 --> 01:16:37,549
They're pierced<i>, </i> Mom<i>, </i> not clip on.

1137
01:16:37,753 --> 01:16:38,378
You pierced your ear?!

1138
01:16:39,354 --> 01:16:40,378
You are dead fish!

1139
01:16:40,522 --> 01:16:42,217
It's meat<i>, </i> Mom. Not fish.

1140
01:16:42,658 --> 01:16:43,818
Meat<i>, </i> fish...
I don't care what it is!

1141
01:16:44,159 --> 01:16:47,890
That is ridiculous.
You look like a complete pinhead.

1142
01:16:49,131 --> 01:16:51,622
Earring!

1143
01:16:52,901 --> 01:16:56,564
I'll never do it again. Mom!

1144
01:16:56,738 --> 01:16:57,864
Hey<i>, </i> nice going<i>, </i> Ace.

1145
01:16:58,173 --> 01:17:00,232
Hey<i>, </i> it wasn't my idea to pierce
all their ears. They thought it'd

1146
01:17:00,976 --> 01:17:02,136
raise team spirit.

1147
01:17:02,611 --> 01:17:06,911
Oh man. Hey<i>, </i> Howard<i>, </i>
we've gotta do something.

1148
01:17:07,149 --> 01:17:08,776
Well<i>, </i> let's get everyone lined up
for the National Anthem.

1149
01:17:09,051 --> 01:17:09,847
That'll make them stand still.

1150
01:17:10,385 --> 01:17:11,875
No can do.
Shelia's suppose to sing.

1151
01:17:12,187 --> 01:17:14,246
What am I suppose to tell her.
She's never seen a boy in and

1152
01:17:14,723 --> 01:17:15,747
earring. It's not just
your grandmother.

1153
01:17:16,091 --> 01:17:18,525
We need a volunteer.

1154
01:17:20,262 --> 01:17:29,136
Me? Sing? The National Anthem?
I don't think so.

1155
01:17:35,744 --> 01:17:39,646

Go<i>, </i> go<i>, </i> go Moms<i>, </i> go!

Go<i>, </i> go<i>, </i> go Moms<i>, </i> go!

1157
01:17:51,860 --> 01:17:57,059
We are set for the first annual
Mothers/Sons football game!

1158
01:17:57,566 --> 01:18:01,900
We're set for the kick-off.
The Moms are kicking off to the

1159
01:18:02,037 --> 01:18:05,939
Sons. And oh<i>, </i> look<i>, </i> kicking off is
none other than my lovely and

1160
01:18:06,408 --> 01:18:10,242
intelligent wife<i>, </i> Faith Dooley.
Faith<i>, </i> honey<i>, </i> wave to the camera!

1161
01:18:11,346 --> 01:18:14,679
Hi! Alright<i>, </i> alright.

1162
01:18:24,860 --> 01:18:25,918
Alright<i>, </i> the ball is picked up ah<i>, </i>

the ten! He's going to go all
the way<i>, </i> folds! Touchdown!

1165
01:18:36,872 --> 01:18:40,603
Touchdown Sons! And they take a
quick lead six to nothing!

1166
01:18:40,942 --> 01:18:42,273
YES!

1167
01:18:44,613 --> 01:18:47,946
Ahh. Ahh.

1168
01:18:48,216 --> 01:18:49,774
They got one. We get the ball
next. We're still gonna win.

1169
01:18:49,985 --> 01:18:50,815
Don't worry about it.

1170
01:18:51,420 --> 01:18:53,513
Come on now<i>, </i> you're okay!
That's alright!

1171
01:18:56,491 --> 01:18:57,924
Sorry.

1172
01:18:58,260 --> 01:18:59,921
I got it. Alright.

1173
01:19:07,402 --> 01:19:08,198
Hut. Hut.

1174
01:19:09,471 --> 01:19:11,405
Oh<i>, </i> I'm so sorry.

1175
01:19:12,374 --> 01:19:20,713
You okay<i>, </i> Mrs. Dooley?

1176
01:19:22,250 --> 01:19:31,454
Hey<i>, </i> Faith. Get over center!
Take the hike from center<i>, </i> Faith!

1177
01:19:35,263 --> 01:19:36,059
Hut! Hut!

1178
01:19:42,137 --> 01:19:44,662
Oooh<i>, </i> intercepted by Fred Badowski.

1179
01:19:47,509 --> 01:19:50,501
Way to go<i>, </i> Freddy!

1180
01:19:59,754 --> 01:20:02,780
One<i>, </i> two<i>, </i> three.

1181
01:20:04,326 --> 01:20:15,863
Come on. One two<i>, </i> ready go.

1182
01:20:20,575 --> 01:20:26,275
Ready<i>, </i> set. Hut<i>, </i> hut-hut. Hut-hut!

1183
01:20:29,651 --> 01:20:30,140
What'd I do?

1184
01:20:30,719 --> 01:20:32,016
Joey's throwing you off
with his count.

1185
01:20:32,687 --> 01:20:33,051
Oh.

1186
01:20:33,588 --> 01:20:35,419
Don't move before you see
the ball leave the ground.

1187
01:20:35,824 --> 01:20:36,256
Okay.

1188
01:20:36,491 --> 01:20:38,322
And you're hitting me too high.
Get low.

1189
01:20:38,593 --> 01:20:40,254
Okay. Thank you.

1190
01:20:42,164 --> 01:20:48,000
Ready set! Hut! Hut-hut!
Hut-hut! Hut-hut.

1191
01:20:51,673 --> 01:20:55,973
That's the way to do it<i>, </i> Mom.
Great job.

1192
03:24:42,558 --> 03:24:44,526
Thanks<i>, </i> honey.

1193
01:21:00,682 --> 01:21:02,377
Set. Hut-hut.

1194
01:21:15,997 --> 01:21:20,627
Alright. Beautiful move by Tim
Seaver. Really faked his mom out.

1195
01:21:22,404 --> 01:21:24,872
Put her in the popcorn machine.
Left her in the mud hole.

1196
01:21:25,574 --> 01:21:27,439
And Nancy is down on the field.

1197
01:21:29,678 --> 01:21:31,407
You okay?

1198
01:21:33,114 --> 01:21:34,206
How'd you get so fast?

1199
01:21:34,649 --> 01:21:35,809
I've got motivation.

1200
01:21:36,084 --> 01:21:37,608
From Coach Cox?

1201
01:21:38,019 --> 01:21:39,247
No. From you.

1202
01:21:41,723 --> 01:21:44,590
Well<i>, </i> whatever I said... I lied!

1203
01:21:47,162 --> 01:21:50,154
Oooh<i>, </i> no good.
Just off to the left. Alright<i>, </i>

1204
01:21:50,599 --> 01:21:53,397
that makes it 13 to nothing<i>, </i> Sons.

1205
01:21:58,206 --> 01:22:03,508
Ocme on everybody! Cookies!
Brownies! Get over here!

1206
01:22:03,812 --> 01:22:04,369
Now remember what we worked on
the last couple of weeks?

1207
01:22:05,080 --> 01:22:08,208
The basics. Don't let them run
the quarter and if it's a pass

1208
01:22:08,316 --> 01:22:11,547
get your hands up in the air.
Now<i>, </i> you can do that<i>, </i> right?

1209
01:22:11,753 --> 01:22:12,276
Right.

1210
01:22:12,687 --> 01:22:13,051
Right!

1211
01:22:13,121 --> 01:22:13,815
Right!

1212
01:22:13,922 --> 01:22:14,946
Let's go then! Come on!

1213
01:22:18,093 --> 01:22:18,752
Hut! Hut!

1214
01:22:22,264 --> 01:22:24,494
Go<i>, </i> Moms! Hit 'em again!

1215
01:22:25,800 --> 01:22:27,267
How's that for motivation?

1216
01:22:42,784 --> 01:22:43,842
You guys don't have a pray.

1217
01:22:44,352 --> 01:22:46,286
You want me to tell dad how you
broke the CD player?

1218
01:22:46,721 --> 01:22:47,119
No.

1219
01:22:47,422 --> 01:22:48,218
Then shut up!

1220
01:22:53,762 --> 01:22:56,560
Ready<i>, </i> set... hut! Hut!

1221
01:23:08,343 --> 01:23:10,334
That's for the 'B+' in Algebra.

1222
01:23:10,745 --> 01:23:11,109
What?

1223
01:23:11,513 --> 01:23:13,879
It should have an 'A'. By the way<i>, </i>
don't you ever call me a whimp again.

1224
01:23:16,818 --> 01:23:18,012
M-O-M-! MOMS!

1225
01:23:19,287 --> 01:23:20,276
Yeah!

1226
01:23:31,833 --> 01:23:34,461
Hey<i>, </i> Ann. He wants you to carry.

1227
01:23:35,370 --> 01:23:36,234
I can't carry.

1228
01:23:36,671 --> 01:23:37,330
Yes<i>, </i> you can.

1229
01:23:38,707 --> 01:23:40,607
On two. Ready<i>, </i> break!

1230
01:23:40,875 --> 01:23:42,467
Go!

1231
01:23:46,848 --> 01:23:47,314
Nancy!

1232
01:23:48,183 --> 01:23:48,581
What?

1233
01:23:52,721 --> 01:23:53,346
What do I do?

1234
01:23:54,923 --> 01:23:57,949
Well<i>, </i> you stand there...
get the ball and then you run.

1235
01:23:59,294 --> 01:24:03,196
Right. Stand there...
get the ball... run.

1236
01:24:04,399 --> 01:24:06,458
Run play! Run play!

1237
01:24:14,642 --> 01:24:16,041
Go Mom<i>, </i> go!

1238
01:24:16,745 --> 01:24:18,303
I'm running. I'm running.
I'm running.

1239
01:24:19,314 --> 01:24:21,145
Hit her low.

1240
01:24:21,383 --> 01:24:22,008
I'm running.

1241
01:24:22,317 --> 01:24:24,615
Okay. I got her.

1242
01:24:25,620 --> 01:24:27,679
Ladies and gentlemen<i>, </i>
she's carrying two young men

1243
01:24:28,289 --> 01:24:29,278
towards the goal line!

1244
01:24:29,657 --> 01:24:33,184
I'm running. I'm running.

1245
01:24:33,428 --> 01:24:33,951
Go! Go!

1246
01:24:38,900 --> 01:24:39,889
Alright! Alright!

1247
01:24:50,612 --> 01:24:53,240
Why to go<i>, </i> Mom!

1248
01:25:05,860 --> 01:25:10,763
It's up... and it's good! Alright!
And the score is The Son<i>, </i>

1249
01:25:11,266 --> 01:25:13,496
13 and The Moms<i>, </i> 7!

1250
01:25:23,878 --> 01:25:24,708
Oh<i>, </i> you guys are doing great!

1251
01:25:25,280 --> 01:25:28,340
Alright<i>, </i> team spirit. I love it!

1252
01:25:42,697 --> 01:25:50,570
We are not... I repeat NOT<i>, </i>
gonna to lose to a bunch of

1253
01:25:50,805 --> 01:25:52,705
mothers. Do you hear me?!

1254
01:25:54,175 --> 01:25:55,972
Come on<i>, </i> Coach<i>, </i> it's just a game.

1255
01:25:56,845 --> 01:26:06,015
It is not!! It's about honor!
Our honor! See women can be smart.

1256
01:26:06,321 --> 01:26:11,691
They can play tennis.
They can be president of the whole

1257
01:26:11,960 --> 01:26:18,195
U.S. of A!
But they cannot play football!!

1258
01:26:20,935 --> 01:26:22,926
Do I make myself clear?!!

1259
01:26:26,975 --> 01:26:30,775
Come on you guys.
Do you have any idea what these

1260
01:26:31,012 --> 01:26:33,139
boys are going to be like for the
whole rest of the year if they

1261
01:26:33,381 --> 01:26:36,544
beat us here today?
We gotta do it!

1262
01:26:37,218 --> 01:26:40,381
Maybe the coach has got a point.
Do you have any idea

1263
01:26:41,022 --> 01:26:43,013
what it'll be like
living with them if they win?

1264
01:26:44,025 --> 01:26:46,721
Nancy's right<i>, </i> you know.
We owe it to ourselves to win.

1265
01:26:47,629 --> 01:26:50,325
Hell<i>, </i> we owe it to Nancy.
She's the one who's done all

1266
01:26:50,698 --> 01:26:52,325
this and made us believe that
we can do it.

1267
01:26:52,500 --> 01:26:53,592
So<i>, </i> are we going to let her down?

1268
01:26:54,202 --> 01:26:54,668
No.

1269
01:26:55,336 --> 01:26:55,961
Are we?

1270
01:26:56,571 --> 01:26:57,560
NO!

1271
01:26:58,239 --> 01:26:58,603
Nancy!

1272
01:26:58,907 --> 01:27:05,369
Nancy! Nancy! Nancy!
Nancy! Nancy! Nancy!

1273
01:27:05,513 --> 01:27:06,309
Let's get 'em!

1274
01:27:06,581 --> 01:27:06,842
Yeah!

1275
01:27:07,181 --> 01:27:07,840
Let's go!

1276
01:27:08,783 --> 01:27:12,150
Let's go out there and
blast the little suckers!

1277
01:27:12,420 --> 01:27:14,149
Yeah!

1278
01:27:16,190 --> 01:27:18,681
Let's go! Let's go!

1279
01:27:32,407 --> 01:27:38,607
Hey<i>, </i> Tim. Think your Dad's watching?

1280
01:27:39,180 --> 01:27:39,737
On the fitty.

1281
01:27:40,648 --> 01:27:41,546
I bet he's proud.

1282
01:27:42,250 --> 01:27:43,080
Of both of us.

1283
01:28:06,507 --> 01:28:07,201
MOM!

1284
01:28:07,375 --> 01:28:08,239
Cotcha.

1285
01:28:15,516 --> 01:28:19,782
Hey<i>, </i> let go! Let go!

1286
01:28:23,091 --> 01:28:26,288
Let me up! Let me up!

1287
01:29:21,082 --> 01:29:22,174
Yeah!

1288
01:29:23,918 --> 01:29:25,317
Ready<i>, </i> set<i>, </i> hut!

1289
01:29:43,337 --> 01:29:45,999
Alright<i>, </i> they used up their last
time out. We got one left. Save it.

1290
01:29:46,874 --> 01:29:49,468
Now<i>, </i> they're probably gonna run
the ball at us. We need a turnover.

1291
01:29:50,144 --> 01:29:53,011
Okay. We did talk about this<i>, </i>
right? Turnovers?

1292
01:29:53,347 --> 01:29:55,781
Stripping the ball!
Alright<i>, </i> in here!

1293
01:29:56,317 --> 01:29:57,045
Let's go!

1294
01:29:57,885 --> 01:30:00,251
Get out there. Come on! Alright!

1295
01:30:00,421 --> 01:30:01,547
Break!

1296
01:30:05,560 --> 01:30:08,222
Set! Hut! Hut!

1297
01:30:15,670 --> 01:30:19,231
These moms have really done
themselves proud but<i>, </i>

1298
01:30:19,674 --> 01:30:22,108
basically they're just running
on fumes at this point.

1299
01:30:22,543 --> 01:30:26,035
Again<i>, </i> the score's 16-13.
It looks like this will be the

1300
01:30:26,347 --> 01:30:28,508
last play of the game.
Wait a minute! Fumble!

1301
01:30:28,850 --> 01:30:29,839
And the mom's have recovered!

1302
01:30:32,320 --> 01:30:33,787
Call time out! Call time out!

1303
01:30:34,155 --> 01:30:35,053
Time!

1304
01:30:40,695 --> 01:30:41,286
What do we do?

1305
01:30:42,096 --> 01:30:44,530
Defense - Defense!
Defense - Defense!

1306
01:30:45,133 --> 01:30:47,067
Defense - Defense!
Defense - Defense!

1307
01:30:47,835 --> 01:30:49,996
Defense - Defense!

1308
01:30:55,209 --> 01:30:57,370
Okay. Here's the play.

1309
01:30:58,679 --> 01:30:59,839
Should we let'em tie?

1310
01:31:00,181 --> 01:31:02,172
We could lay back on our backs
and die and they still wouldn't

1311
01:31:02,416 --> 01:31:02,882
make that kick.

1312
01:31:03,284 --> 01:31:04,581
Okay guys<i>, </i> ready.

1313
01:31:05,019 --> 01:31:05,508
BREAK!

1314
01:31:06,120 --> 01:31:08,782
Block that kick! Block that kick!
Block that kick! Block that kick!

1315
01:31:09,924 --> 01:31:10,253
Block that kick!

1316
01:31:16,297 --> 01:31:17,491
Get in there and block it!

1317
01:31:18,199 --> 01:31:21,726
Block that kick! Block that kick!
Block that kick! Block that kick!

1318
01:31:22,203 --> 01:31:24,967
Block that kick!

1319
01:31:26,741 --> 01:31:27,070
Hut!

1320
01:31:30,878 --> 01:31:32,038
Statue if Liberty play.

1321
01:31:32,446 --> 01:31:33,743
The old Statue of Liberty!
