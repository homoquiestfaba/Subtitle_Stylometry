and did not know why.

151
00:14:02,346 --> 00:14:04,682
We met at the dock, and talk about it,

152
00:14:04,723 --> 00:14:06,684

Ah. Fuck ... Go.

296
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:49,034
And That submarine ...

297
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:51,954
I sank a tanker off the coast of Nantucket.

298
00:22:53,247 --> 00:22:55,666
In 1944.

299
00:22:55,749 --> 00:22:57,583
In A-550.

300
00:22:57,667 --> 00:22:59,711
The guy's name was Kozak. They found him.

301
00:22:59,752 --> 00:23:02,839
I was found 200 feet deep. Give Me. That goes along.

302
00:23:05,091 --> 00:23:06,759
You know, there is no concrete proof,

303
00:23:06,843 --> 00:23:10,096
but many of These subs used to keep circling

304
00:23:10,179 --> 00:23:12,820
in the sea off the exit port, waiting for boats

305
00:23:12,890 --> 00:23:16,854
and there is one at Least That report says

306
00:23:16,937 --> 00:23:22,568
the Lionfish is responsible for saving His Life to 700 soldiers.

307
00:23:22,609 --> 00:23:24,403
Can we better not start today?

308
00:23:24,486 --> 00:23:26,321
I mean, I know not what you expect to find,

309
00:23:26,404 --> 00:23:29,198
but I'm pretty sure any evidence to support your theories

310
00:23:29,282 --> 00:23:31,951
and was removed before grant you access.

311
00:23:33,286 --> 00:23:35,580
It's crazy. Reports say I was in dry dock.

312
00:23:35,622 --> 00:23:37,662
I reviewed the testimony of eyewitnesses.

313
00:23:37,665 --> 00:23:38,916
Yes, definitely.

314
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,461

00:23:56,476 --> 00:24:00,271
When Will They order Their names?

321
00:24:00,355 --> 00:24:02,774
I have no idea how much I paid the guy.

322
00:24:02,815 --> 00:24:04,567
I missed you. Come, give me a hug.

323

When you tell me ...

332
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,417
Can you believe it? We will be the first

333
00:24:21,501 --> 00:24:24,629

334

And why call boats?

413
00:29:05,447 --> 00:29:07,909
The Navy considers all ships and boats,

414
00:29:07,993 --> 00:29:10,787

Wait. Hold on there, guys.

What was that?

444
00:34:44,285 --> 00:34:45,955
Oh, my God.

445
00:34:48,499 --> 00:34:50,250

00:34:50,292 --> 00:34:52,920

How did you know that ...?

449
00:34:59,635 --> 00:35:02,554
It was the Commander Sterling Assumed That was to take command of the Lionfish.

450
00:35:02,638 --> 00:35:04,139
I Disappeared the same day.

451
00:35:04,223 --> 00:35:06,934
But That was just a hunch, until, now.

453
00:35:39,508 --> 00:35:41,135

454
00:35:49,435 --> 00:35:51,812

455
00:35:51,895 --> 00:35:53,313
Okay. You do not need a drink.

456
00:35:53,354 --> 00:35:55,481
And you honestly not need me here.

457
00:36:08,453 --> 00:36:09,913
Well, then.

458
00:36:09,997 --> 00:36:11,457

459
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:16,295

We Could take the picture of the whole team ...

524
00:40:43,892 --> 00:40:44,932

534
00:41:14,422 --> 00:41:17,717
- Say "Lionfish". - Lancen one torpedo.

535
00:41:32,232 --> 00:41:33,692
- Hey, hey. - Do not open.

536
00:41:38,029 --> 00:41:39,197

00:41:41,032 --> 00:41:42,200
There ... There's something there.

539
00:41:42,284 --> 00:41:45,245
Mikey was probably a draft, right?

540
00:41:45,328 --> 00:41:47,289
- Here we go. - OK? Come on. Get Up.

541
00:41:48,456 --> 00:41:49,457

00:42:27,244 --> 00:42:28,244
Try the lever.

553
00:42:28,245 --> 00:42:29,496
- That I do. - Push a little harder.

554
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:32,541
Guys, come on. We have to concentrate.

555
00:42:32,625 --> 00:42:34,710
Now lets fuck.

556
00:42:34,793 --> 00:42:36,170
Mike.

557
00:42:41,635 --> 00:42:42,886
Great.

558
00:42:42,927 --> 00:42:44,721
Just great.

559
00:42:46,431 --> 00:42:48,308
Ah, get out of my fucking way. Let me try.

560
00:42:48,391 --> 00:42:50,059
Hey, what's happening? What?

561
00:42:50,142 --> 00:42:51,393
This fucking thing is stuck.

562
00:42:51,435 --> 00:42:53,479
- Mike ... - No open.

563
00:42:53,562 --> 00:42:55,564
Mike, calm down. Already low. Come Down.

564
00:42:55,648 --> 00:42:56,774
Down from there, friend. Low and calm down.

565
00:42:56,857 --> 00:42:58,943
It's no big deal. As will open the other.

566
00:42:59,026 --> 00:43:00,152
What happen?

567
00:43:00,235 --> 00:43:02,863
You Have to do a little force.

568
00:43:02,947 --> 00:43:05,240
- It's a little tight. Wait. - This is not good.

569
00:43:05,282 --> 00:43:07,409
Okay, it does not open.

570
00:43:07,493 --> 00:43:09,370
Oh, great.

571
00:43:09,453 --> 00:43:10,704
- Well, Mike, it's no big deal. - No, this is not good.

572
00:43:10,788 --> 00:43:12,415
- We have to find a way out. - Calm down. Wait, relax.

573
00:43:12,457 --> 00:43:14,250
Just find another hatch.

574
00:43:14,292 --> 00:43:16,127
Yes, I can not open it. It is screwed.

575
00:43:16,211 --> 00:43:17,711
- Not great fucking thing. - Mike, calm.

576
00:43:17,795 --> 00:43:19,380
Not a big problem friend.

577
00:43:19,463 --> 00:43:21,090
I have is a little claustrophobic.

578
00:43:21,131 --> 00:43:25,260
Is a little claustrophobic?

579
00:43:25,344 --> 00:43:26,929
Great.

580
00:43:28,806 --> 00:43:30,266
Mikey.

581
00:43:30,349 --> 00:43:31,475
Mike.

582
00:43:33,352 --> 00:43:34,812
Friend.

583
00:43:34,895 --> 00:43:36,146
Dude, that ...

584
00:43:36,230 --> 00:43:39,108
That hatch has chains outside, do you remember?

585
00:43:39,191 --> 00:43:40,631
Do you remember? It is locked With chains.

586
00:43:40,651 --> 00:43:42,069
Already low. Come Down.

587
00:43:42,152 --> 00:43:44,113
Maybe with a wrench we hit on the helmet,

588
00:43:44,195 --> 00:43:45,955
and attention. But no one will hear.

589
00:43:45,989 --> 00:43:47,408
Not a big deal.

590
00:43:47,491 --> 00:43:48,617
That is not a big problem?

591
00:43:48,659 --> 00:43:50,327
Not a big deal to you, maybe.

592
00:43:50,411 --> 00:43:52,413
I get hysterical to stay stuck in ...

593
00:43:52,496 --> 00:43:54,957
in small places, not to mention smaller venues metal

594
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:56,667
That are designed to sink.

595
00:43:58,043 --> 00:44:00,087
I have to find something to get Their attention.

596
00:44:05,968 --> 00:44:07,636
No one will hear.

597
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:08,721
What?

598
00:44:08,804 --> 00:44:10,180
I Said That no one will hear.

599
00:44:10,264 --> 00:44:11,473
Get down from there.

600
00:44:14,976 --> 00:44:16,519
- Why? - Because no one is around

601
00:44:16,603 --> 00:44:18,062
This I submarine tonight.

602
00:44:18,146 --> 00:44:20,026
We Should sit back Until the morning.

603
00:44:20,064 --> 00:44:22,525
Vicki, check your phone.

604
00:44:25,362 --> 00:44:26,488
We'll be here for a while, you know?

605
00:44:26,530 --> 00:44:28,032
Get over it.

606
00:44:28,073 --> 00:44:29,713
They can stay here if They Want.

607
00:44:31,702 --> 00:44:33,245
They'll Have to wait a long time.

608
00:44:55,892 --> 00:44:57,226
Hey.

609
00:45:00,064 --> 00:45:01,565
Hey, guys.

610
00:45:01,649 --> 00:45:02,816

Go.

614
00:45:09,822 --> 00:45:13,201
If it is a product of the government, the average date will be acerca 100 years.

615
00:45:14,410 --> 00:45:16,829
Let's see if I can find a pot of coffee or something.

616
00:45:50,281 --> 00:45:51,281
Did you hear that?

617
00:45:53,325 --> 00:45:54,702
Peter, Where does that?

618
00:45:58,539 --> 00:46:00,749
It comes from the stern.

619
00:46:57,848 --> 00:46:59,140
It is this way.

620
00:47:08,524 --> 00:47:10,026
There.

621
00:47:12,695 --> 00:47:13,821
Dogs.

622
00:47:13,905 --> 00:47:15,823
Damn.

623
00:47:15,865 --> 00:47:18,994
Ghosts, see? I Knew it.

624
00:47:19,078 --> 00:47:20,454
Really?

625
00:47:20,537 --> 00:47:21,497
Commander, Nov. ...

626
00:47:21,538 --> 00:47:22,998
What the hell?

627
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:26,125
Great, we are in a haunted boat.

628
00:47:26,209 --> 00:47:28,294
Ah, yes. Great, Pete.

629
00:47:28,378 --> 00:47:32,173
In a tin of 70 Who Can intentionally sink. Bright.

630
00:47:32,215 --> 00:47:34,509
Delta zero pattern ...

631
00:47:34,550 --> 00:47:36,270
There is a logical explanation for esta, Mikey.

632
00:47:36,302 --> 00:47:37,762
Yeah, sure there is, compadre.

633
00:47:37,845 --> 00:47:38,972
Alfa November 113 ...

634
00:47:39,055 --> 00:47:40,598
all ships in Alfa ...

635
00:47:40,682 --> 00:47:43,226
Hey, Pete, I chose this.

636
00:47:43,309 --> 00:47:45,520
Well, Mike, do me favor ...

637
00:47:45,603 --> 00:47:47,981
I want you to come down to the Chamber of Engineering,

638

639
00:47:50,441 --> 00:47:51,441
Can you Do That for me?

640
00:47:51,484 --> 00:47:53,152
OK. Okay.

641
00:47:53,236 --> 00:47:55,571
Well, Vick. Watch Mike.

00:47:57,907 --> 00:47:58,947
Stacey, you with me, come on.

643
00:47:58,992 --> 00:48:01,869
Yes, I already tried. It did not work very well.

644
00:48:01,911 --> 00:48:03,512
The most reliable Radio in the United States.

645
00:48:03,538 --> 00:48:04,747
Ok.

646
00:48:04,831 --> 00:48:06,163

648
00:48:09,917 --> 00:48:11,877
How is it that you 'feel so sure of yourself?

649
00:48:14,297 --> 00:48:15,756
Did we're going to help or ...?

650
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:17,174
Do Not.

651
00:48:17,258 --> 00:48:19,510
What good.

652
00:48:19,594 --> 00:48:20,845
You're an asshole.

653
00:48:44,785 --> 00:48:46,370
Just do not understand.

654
00:48:48,623 --> 00:48:50,332
I dont know.

655
00:48:50,415 --> 00:48:52,125
Maybe Mike With This really hit.

656
00:48:59,132 --> 00:49:00,675
What ... Joders?

657
00:49:00,759 --> 00:49:02,199
LOCKED - CLOSED ON - OPEN

658
00:49:04,095 --> 00:49:05,723
Move alone.

659
00:49:07,725 --> 00:49:09,226
What are you seeing?

660
00:49:14,482 --> 00:49:15,608
See that?

661
00:49:15,650 --> 00:49:16,942
I see and I do not think so.

662
00:49:22,489 --> 00:49:24,449
Is not turned off.

663
00:49:24,491 --> 00:49:25,575
I see and I do not think so.

664
00:49:25,659 --> 00:49:27,035
On behalf of the Commander,

665
00:49:27,118 --> 00:49:29,537

Again, start ...

669
00:49:37,003 --> 00:49:38,129
Hey, guys.

670
00:49:38,213 --> 00:49:39,423
Mikey, have you been screwing

671
00:49:39,507 --> 00:49:40,925
With one of the switches of the boat?

672
00:49:41,008 --> 00:49:42,343
No, we do not.

673
00:49:42,426 --> 00:49:44,552
But there's shit happening around the ship.

674
00:49:44,636 --> 00:49:46,471
Eh ... Bottle.

675
00:49:46,513 --> 00:49:47,889
Correct. Do not enrage

676
00:49:47,973 --> 00:49:49,307
- More than it is already. - E ... E ... Wait. Wait.

677
00:49:49,391 --> 00:49:51,184
What do you mean, "I infuriate"?

678
00:49:51,268 --> 00:49:52,769
This is a can in the water.

679
00:49:52,852 --> 00:49:54,437
This thing is not alive.

680
00:49:54,521 --> 00:49:55,814
What the hell?

681
00:50:10,245 --> 00:50:11,871
OK.

682
00:50:11,955 --> 00:50:12,955
Explain this.

683
00:50:14,708 --> 00:50:15,834
Try turning it off.

684
00:50:22,841 --> 00:50:24,968
- That was interesting. - Fuck.

685
00:50:25,051 --> 00:50:26,261
All are well.

686
00:50:26,344 --> 00:50:28,763
VENTILATION - GREEN-RED-OPEN CLOSED

687
00:50:33,476 --> 00:50:34,644
Tell me you saw That Thing.

688
00:50:34,728 --> 00:50:35,979
- What? - That.

689
00:50:36,062 --> 00:50:37,480
- What the fuck? - I see nothing.

690
00:50:37,564 --> 00:50:38,648
I see nothing.

691
00:50:38,732 --> 00:50:39,733
You ....

692
00:50:50,578 --> 00:50:52,371
Oh, great. Now what?

693
00:50:52,455 --> 00:50:55,124
Okay. Now ... Now I'm starting to scare me.

694
00:51:09,179 --> 00:51:11,389
Good grief. Did you feel that?

695
00:51:11,431 --> 00:51:13,725
Well, gentlemen. It Seems That We Have Implemented.

696
00:51:13,808 --> 00:51:15,435
I will return to the engine room.

697
00:51:15,518 --> 00:51:17,145
It is a good idea.

698
00:51:39,793 --> 00:51:42,587
Wow, what a noisy it is here.

699
00:51:42,629 --> 00:51:44,130
What? I can not hear you.

700
00:51:51,137 --> 00:51:53,974
Mikey, look for a fuel line or an off button.

701
00:51:54,057 --> 00:51:55,934
Any way to stop in Original engines.

702
00:51:55,976 --> 00:51:57,435
I'll go to the stern.

703
00:52:17,497 --> 00:52:18,623
Mike.

704
00:52:20,959 --> 00:52:22,794

Come on, Stace.

706
00:52:24,004 --> 00:52:25,338
We'll go to the control tower

707
00:52:25,422 --> 00:52:27,799
to see if I can find a way to shut it down from above.

708
00:52:29,759 --> 00:52:31,260
Come on, Stace.

709
00:52:34,513 --> 00:52:36,766
- Vick? - Yup.

710
00:52:36,850 --> 00:52:37,850

711
00:52:47,027 --> 00:52:48,069
- Really? - What?

- Look. - Fuck. Get out of the way. Watch.

727
00:53:50,799 --> 00:53:51,841
Did you hear that?

728
00:53:54,301 --> 00:53:56,345
Do you know? I'll fix it, right?

729
00:53:59,265 --> 00:54:00,641
Damn.

730
00:54:12,444 --> 00:54:14,530
Stace, not open.

731
00:54:18,617 --> 00:54:20,911
We are not alone down here.

732
00:54:45,477 --> 00:54:46,937
OK.

733
00:54:47,021 --> 00:54:48,439
Ok.

734

Let's see.

735
00:55:16,675 --> 00:55:17,926
Come out to sea.

736
00:55:18,968 --> 00:55:21,804
What has to happen will happen.

737
00:55:21,888 --> 00:55:23,139
We are trapped.

738
00:55:25,516 --> 00:55:26,726
Check out.

739
00:55:32,149 --> 00:55:33,484
Well, shit.

740
00:55:37,988 --> 00:55:40,032
- No case. - God.

741
00:55:42,743 --> 00:55:44,370
I will review the maps.

742
00:55:59,717 --> 00:56:02,095
Accordingly, we are near the coast of New England.

743
00:56:02,178 --> 00:56:03,638
No, the lights Indicate otherwise.

744
00:56:03,721 --> 00:56:05,015
Do they Indicate Otherwise?

745
00:56:12,773 --> 00:56:14,066
Fuck.

746
00:56:29,415 --> 00:56:31,375
The layout of the buildings is wrong.

747
00:56:31,458 --> 00:56:32,501
- What? - You are right.

748
00:56:32,584 --> 00:56:34,461
I can not run a goddamn thing back here.

749
00:56:34,545 --> 00:56:37,047
What was it that got away?

750
00:56:37,131 --> 00:56:38,465
You're right, return failure.

751
00:56:38,549 --> 00:56:39,967
Where are all the bridges?

752
00:56:40,050 --> 00:56:41,970
- Where is the power plant? - What Fuck?

753
00:56:42,011 --> 00:56:43,345
Where are we, Peter?

754
00:56:43,429 --> 00:56:44,888
How the hell should i know?

755
00:56:44,930 --> 00:56:45,930
Well, I can not take more.

756
00:56:45,973 --> 00:56:47,850
None of esta Makes Sense.

757
00:56:47,933 --> 00:56:49,226
Where are we?

758
00:56:49,268 --> 00:56:50,603
No "where".

759
00:56:50,686 --> 00:56:53,105
No "where" but "when".

760
00:57:08,328 --> 00:57:13,124
In fact, I think today is August 13, 1943.

761
00:57:29,558 --> 00:57:33,437
NEW ENGLAND COAST OF AUGUST 14, 1943

762
00:57:34,897 --> 00:57:37,231
Yes, like ducks ready to be hunted.

763
00:57:37,273 --> 00:57:39,651
5000 meters ...

764
00:57:53,582 --> 00:57:55,084
Are we stopping?

765
00:57:55,125 --> 00:57:57,044
Yes, we're stopping.

766
00:57:57,127 --> 00:57:59,296
I'm outta here. I'm out of here.

767
00:57:59,338 --> 00:58:00,923
Mike. Mike.

768
00:58:01,006 --> 00:58:03,092
Mike, do not go there.

769
00:58:03,133 --> 00:58:04,259
Mike.

770
00:58:14,686 --> 00:58:15,895
Mike.

771
00:58:15,979 --> 00:58:17,355
Open the hatch and friend.

772
00:58:17,438 --> 00:58:18,523
Mike?

773
00:58:19,691 --> 00:58:21,109
Open the hatch.

774
00:58:21,150 --> 00:58:24,320
Open it in your hand, open it.

775
00:58:24,404 --> 00:58:26,698
It is stuck.

776
00:58:26,781 --> 00:58:29,159
Mike, That hatch open now, buddy.

777
00:58:29,243 --> 00:58:31,786
VALVES OF INCOME

778
00:58:31,869 --> 00:58:33,079
- Come here to help. - Hey, Peter?

779
00:58:33,162 --> 00:58:34,330
Peter. Peter. Look at this.

780
00:58:34,414 --> 00:58:35,957
- What? - Look.

781
00:58:39,711 --> 00:58:40,712
Open the hatch.

782
00:58:40,795 --> 00:58:41,879
What was that?

783
00:58:41,963 --> 00:58:42,922
That Means the valves are closing.

784
00:58:43,006 --> 00:58:44,882
It Means we are immersing ourselves.

785
00:58:44,964 --> 00:58:46,632
Mike, open the hatch.

786
00:58:50,845 --> 00:58:51,846
Pete.

787
00:58:51,929 --> 00:58:52,929
Heavens, Garmin.

788
00:58:52,972 --> 00:58:53,973
Can you help me eat?

789
00:58:54,056 --> 00:58:55,056
Sorry, I can not.

790
00:58:55,057 --> 00:58:56,350
Pete.

791
00:58:56,392 --> 00:58:58,227
What the fuck does that mean?

792
00:58:58,311 --> 00:58:59,811
- Come here to help. - Peter. Peter. Peter.

793
00:58:59,894 --> 00:59:01,688
- Look. - What?

794
00:59:03,774 --> 00:59:05,026
Is that one ...

795
00:59:05,067 --> 00:59:07,653
Tanks and negative security are flooded.

796
00:59:10,364 --> 00:59:12,742
This sucks, Garmin.

797
00:59:17,788 --> 00:59:19,290
Hold on, folks.

798
00:59:19,373 --> 00:59:20,708
Hold on.

799
00:59:29,382 --> 00:59:30,508
Pete.

800
00:59:36,264 --> 00:59:39,226
The hatches are closed as well, it's probably simpler protocol,

801
00:59:39,268 --> 00:59:41,062
for the procedure to dive.

802
00:59:41,103 --> 00:59:45,232
At least ... that's what I hope.

803
00:59:53,574 --> 00:59:55,659
You review our depth, will you?

804
00:59:55,742 --> 00:59:56,826
How do I know?

805
00:59:56,910 --> 00:59:58,370
To your left. Look, Vick, Mira.

806
00:59:59,829 --> 01:00:00,829
35 feet.

807
01:00:00,830 --> 01:00:01,831
Keep counting.

808
01:00:03,083 --> 01:00:04,459
40 feet.

809
01:00:06,670 --> 01:00:08,380
55 feet.

810
01:00:11,258 --> 01:00:12,926
60 feet.

811
01:00:17,431 --> 01:00:20,476
I'm really learning to hate submarines.

812
01:00:41,454 --> 01:00:42,622
Oh, my God.

813
01:00:42,706 --> 01:00:43,790
Are you okay, man?

814
01:00:43,873 --> 01:00:45,208
Are you okay?

815
01:00:48,462 --> 01:00:50,338
Where the hell is going?

816
01:00:57,971 --> 01:01:00,056
The hatch is ...

817
01:01:00,140 --> 01:01:01,641
the hatch ...

818
01:01:07,564 --> 01:01:10,025
And Then it opened and I just Jumped ...

819
01:01:10,108 --> 01:01:11,308
When Things changed His mind.

820
01:01:11,318 --> 01:01:12,986
How can you change your mind?

821
01:01:13,069 --> 01:01:14,821
It's a fucking boat.

822
01:01:23,955 --> 01:01:25,791
Okay, Garmin. Start talking.

823
01:01:25,875 --> 01:01:27,084
What the hell is going on?

824
01:01:27,168 --> 01:01:28,586
Come on, we want answers.

825
01:01:28,669 --> 01:01:30,087
I can not give them. I can not talk about it.

826
01:01:30,171 --> 01:01:32,006
Can not talk about it? What the fuck does

827
01:01:32,089 --> 01:01:33,650
en esta pot if you can not talk about it?

828
01:01:33,674 --> 01:01:36,177
- Start talking. - I'm not at liberty to discuss ...

829
01:01:36,260 --> 01:01:37,553
- What's up? Tell us. - Is not it released?

830
01:01:37,637 --> 01:01:39,013
Peter, I is not free.

831
01:01:39,055 --> 01:01:40,139
You better find some freedom.

832
01:01:40,222 --> 01:01:41,262
- Start talking. - Hey.

833
01:01:41,307 --> 01:01:42,642
Can you ...?

834
01:01:42,683 --> 01:01:44,143
I can not talk about it ...

835
01:01:44,226 --> 01:01:46,728
- I do not care. - ... At all.

836
01:01:46,811 --> 01:01:48,021
- Professor ... - Do not touch me.

837
01:01:48,063 --> 01:01:49,731
Can Control His wife, please?

838
01:01:49,814 --> 01:01:51,358
I'm not your wife.

839
01:01:51,441 --> 01:01:53,151
Hear. Now calm down.

840
01:01:53,234 --> 01:01:54,674
- Quiet. - Do not push my wife.

841
01:01:54,694 --> 01:01:55,904
Profe ... What the fuck?

842
01:01:58,365 --> 01:01:59,784
- Peter. - Professor.

843
01:01:59,867 --> 01:02:00,868
- Peter. - Calm Down.

844
01:02:00,952 --> 01:02:01,994
There are lots of things happening

845
01:02:02,078 --> 01:02:03,078
of Which I knows nothing.

846
01:02:03,120 --> 01:02:04,664
Already for. Already for.

847
01:02:04,747 --> 01:02:07,208
Professor, please.

848
01:02:07,250 --> 01:02:08,668
Reassurance.

849
01:02:08,709 --> 01:02:09,752
Lady, hear.

850
01:02:09,835 --> 01:02:11,045
What are you doing?

851
01:02:11,087 --> 01:02:12,546
What do you ...? Give me that.

852
01:02:12,630 --> 01:02:14,130
Now stop, you, stop.

853
01:02:15,674 --> 01:02:18,551
Lady, things in esta boat does not respond well to bullets.

854
01:02:18,593 --> 01:02:19,844
Professor, listen.

855
01:02:19,928 --> 01:02:21,721
Let me Explain ...

856
01:02:30,397 --> 01:02:31,439
What the fuck did you do?

857
01:02:31,523 --> 01:02:32,732
- Ah, I saved your life. - I already did.

858
01:02:32,774 --> 01:02:35,236
Did you had it? You could not even breathe.

859
01:02:35,319 --> 01:02:37,405
Now we'll never be reliable to get information.

860
01:02:37,488 --> 01:02:39,490
- You killed him. - Let's see if we get something you like.

861
01:02:39,573 --> 01:02:40,573
What are you doing,

862
01:02:40,657 --> 01:02:42,575
firing a gun inside a submarine?

863
01:02:50,166 --> 01:02:51,710
What the hell did you do?

864
01:02:51,793 --> 01:02:53,378
- I saved. - What did you do?

865
01:02:53,420 --> 01:02:55,630
Peter, I saved your life.

866
01:02:55,714 --> 01:02:57,257
- I did. - Calm down.

867
01:02:57,340 --> 01:02:58,508
- God. - Please ...

868
01:02:58,592 --> 01:03:01,636
Really you're doubting That saved your life?

869
01:03:01,720 --> 01:03:03,430
Stace. Heavens.

870
01:03:03,471 --> 01:03:05,515
Do not you think We have enough problems

871
01:03:05,599 --> 01:03:07,434

872
01:03:07,517 --> 01:03:09,185
Well, come here, Stace. Do me favor,

01:03:09,269 --> 01:03:10,270

874
01:03:10,353 --> 01:03:11,563
Warmly. Depart.

875
01:03:11,605 --> 01:03:12,885
We need something to hold.

876
01:03:17,152 --> 01:03:19,029
What the hell happened here?

877
01:03:19,112 --> 01:03:20,447
You gonna tell me what Happened ...

878
01:03:20,488 --> 01:03:22,991
We are trying to figure out what the hell is going on.

879
01:03:24,451 --> 01:03:27,162
There must be something here.

880
01:03:32,417 --> 01:03:34,586
What is that?

881
01:03:34,628 --> 01:03:35,921
What a weirdo.

882
01:03:39,006 --> 01:03:40,299
Bingo.

883
01:03:45,972 --> 01:03:47,098
I found this.

884
01:03:47,182 --> 01:03:48,308
Hey.

885
01:03:48,391 --> 01:03:50,143
Audio and video to computer ...

886
01:03:50,185 --> 01:03:51,478
Wives.

887
01:03:54,731 --> 01:03:57,734
It's one less problem and get 90 more, uh, Peter?

888
01:03:57,817 --> 01:03:59,653
Why you looking at me like that?

889
01:03:59,694 --> 01:04:00,815
Am I blaming you for it?

890
01:04:02,238 --> 01:04:03,615
You brought` us here.

891
01:04:04,823 --> 01:04:07,076
- That's why we're here, man. - Yeah yeah.

892
01:04:07,159 --> 01:04:10,120
I put a gun to Their fucking heads and forced to eat.

893
01:04:10,204 --> 01:04:11,747
You know what? Let us deal With This right now, okay?

894
01:04:11,830 --> 01:04:14,166
. - Cúlpenme me Come on, do it. - OK. All Right.

895
01:05:54,849 --> 01:05:56,392
Are you going to remove the handcuffs?

896
01:05:59,145 --> 01:06:01,230
Why?

897
01:06:01,314 --> 01:06:02,899
Why, what?

898
01:06:02,941 --> 01:06:04,442
Why all this?

899
01:06:07,154 --> 01:06:08,154
I mean, why? Why?

900
01:06:08,155 --> 01:06:09,573
Tell me why. Why all this?

901
01:06:09,615 --> 01:06:11,116
It's a long story, right?

902
01:06:13,452 --> 01:06:14,452
Wait, wait. Recedes.

903
01:06:14,495 --> 01:06:15,996
Hey, hey. Low hand.

904
01:06:16,080 --> 01:06:17,289
You lower your hand.

905
01:06:17,331 --> 01:06:19,583
Let me see that. Let me see That picture again.

906
01:06:20,834 --> 01:06:22,293
Is that where?

907
01:06:22,377 --> 01:06:23,419
This one?

908
01:06:25,505 --> 01:06:26,714
Why?

909
01:06:26,798 --> 01:06:29,884
What a bastard.

910
01:06:29,968 --> 01:06:34,597
So you do not know everything?

911
01:06:34,639 --> 01:06:35,848
Are you going to take the handcuffs?

912
01:06:37,100 --> 01:06:39,227
- Will you tell me what is happening? - Do Not.

913
01:06:40,312 --> 01:06:42,564
Then no. Fuck you.

914
01:06:43,983 --> 01:06:45,652
Stay seated there. You're grounded.

915
01:06:52,199 --> 01:06:54,243
Why do not you tell me?

916
01:07:17,559 --> 01:07:18,851
Alarm. Alarm. Alarm.

917
01:08:19,994 --> 01:08:22,747
Why do you drag them into your ...?

918
01:08:22,830 --> 01:08:25,918
¿Cabin and you blew your brains?

919
01:08:37,096 --> 01:08:38,347
That's it?

920
01:08:39,932 --> 01:08:41,266
Guess what.

921
01:08:42,433 --> 01:08:43,768
I found you.

922
01:08:51,359 --> 01:08:53,528

01:20:18,080 --> 01:20:19,582
You know why it's burning water?

1104
01:20:19,624 --> 01:20:22,043
The fucking ship Liberty.

1105
01:20:22,126 --> 01:20:24,086
- Is Liberty ship? - Do Not.

1106
01:20:25,463 --> 01:20:26,797
I hear slashing.

1107
01:20:28,466 --> 01:20:29,800
We did.

1108
01:20:33,179 --> 01:20:34,639
Good work, guys.

1109
01:20:35,723 --> 01:20:37,141
Well, I guess ...

1110
01:20:37,183 --> 01:20:39,435
I guess That Makes us heroes submarines.

1111
01:20:50,404 --> 01:20:52,573
Water propellers.

1112
01:20:52,657 --> 01:20:53,950
Water depth charges.

1113
01:20:53,991 --> 01:20:55,326
- Prepare. - Hang on everyone.

1114
01:21:08,172 --> 01:21:09,923
Heavens, folks.

1115
01:21:10,006 --> 01:21:11,925
Are you all right?

1116
01:21:12,008 --> 01:21:13,008
- Vick? - I'm fine.

1117
01:21:13,051 --> 01:21:14,051
Yes, I'm fine.

1118
01:21:14,094 --> 01:21:15,345
It was close.

1119
01:21:34,490 --> 01:21:37,158
Garmin ...

1120
01:21:37,200 --> 01:21:39,119
Why Have We stopped?

1121
01:21:39,202 --> 01:21:41,580
I think this is not what was supposed to happen.

1122
01:21:41,663 --> 01:21:43,540
What is not supposed to happen?

1123
01:21:43,582 --> 01:21:44,874
Is fading.

1124
01:21:44,916 --> 01:21:46,376
Is fading. Why is fading?

1125
01:21:46,459 --> 01:21:48,712
Here comes another.

1126
01:22:06,521 --> 01:22:08,148
Damn.

1127
01:22:11,401 --> 01:22:12,444
Do you have it?

1128
01:22:21,494 --> 01:22:24,873
Fuck.

1129
01:22:24,915 --> 01:22:26,541
I want you to grab that.

1130
01:22:26,625 --> 01:22:28,001
We're in serious trouble.

1131
01:22:30,170 --> 01:22:31,672
36 meters.

1132
01:22:31,756 --> 01:22:33,590
How much more can download this thing before ...?

1133
01:22:33,632 --> 01:22:34,632
To the bottom,

1134
01:22:34,674 --> 01:22:36,009
if we do not stop.

1135
01:22:38,678 --> 01:22:40,096
40 meters.

1136
01:22:56,948 --> 01:22:59,575
This is not happening. This is not happening.

1137
01:23:23,891 --> 01:23:25,059
What do we Have?

1138
01:23:26,978 --> 01:23:28,353
Are you all right?

1139
01:23:28,436 --> 01:23:30,146
Are you okay?

1140
01:23:31,147 --> 01:23:32,399
Vicki.

1141
01:23:32,482 --> 01:23:33,817
Vick. Vick.

1142
01:23:33,900 --> 01:23:35,360
¿Vick?

1143
01:23:36,570 --> 01:23:37,946
¿Vick?

1144
01:23:44,328 --> 01:23:45,997
- What the fuck? - She's dead.

1145
01:24:03,430 --> 01:24:04,973
What the fuck?

1146
01:24:06,516 --> 01:24:09,477
We did everything we where supposed to do. What the fuck?

1147
01:24:10,520 --> 01:24:13,148
Pete, what the fuck?

1148
01:24:13,231 --> 01:24:14,566
Now what?

1149
01:24:15,817 --> 01:24:18,863
What are we still doing here?

1150
01:24:18,946 --> 01:24:21,532
Yes, Garmin. Why are we still here?

1151
01:24:24,868 --> 01:24:27,662
Huh? What is this?

1152
01:24:27,704 --> 01:24:31,333
We are down here Because of your fucking obsession.

1153
01:24:31,374 --> 01:24:33,376
- Mike ... - Look at me.

1154
01:24:36,630 --> 01:24:39,299
Here, all your actions ...

1155
01:24:44,012 --> 01:24:46,181
- In all its glory. - Mike ...

1156
01:24:46,264 --> 01:24:47,974
What, Stace? Huh?

1157
01:24:48,058 --> 01:24:49,601
You want to die?

1158
01:24:49,684 --> 01:24:51,853
So your grandfather can keep all the glory

1159
01:24:51,895 --> 01:24:53,730
and be a hero? Will we all heroes?

1160
01:24:56,024 --> 01:24:57,275
You know something?

1161
01:25:01,863 --> 01:25:05,367
I just want out of esta tin before we all die.

1162
01:25:07,452 --> 01:25:11,289
Garmin, am you can lend a hand with it?

1163
01:25:11,373 --> 01:25:13,291
Please?

1164
01:25:13,375 --> 01:25:14,960
We have to lift it.

1165
01:25:17,254 --> 01:25:18,921
Delicately.

1166
01:25:32,769 --> 01:25:34,354
Fuck you, Pete.

1167
01:25:42,904 --> 01:25:44,781
Peter, is not ...

1168
01:25:44,864 --> 01:25:46,074
Mikey is right.

1169
01:25:52,496 --> 01:25:54,206
It's my fault.

1170
01:25:57,960 --> 01:26:00,379
My fault you're here.

1171
01:26:04,801 --> 01:26:06,970
It's my fault Mikey's here.

1172
01:26:20,149 --> 01:26:21,859
It's my fault ...

1173
01:26:23,903 --> 01:26:25,446
Vicki is dead.

1174
01:26:31,619 --> 01:26:33,329
Everything is my fault.

1175
01:26:47,927 --> 01:26:49,345
Are you happy, Grandpa?

1176
01:26:53,515 --> 01:26:54,516
Did you enjoy it?

1177
01:27:31,136 --> 01:27:32,805
What are we doing here?

1178
01:28:16,807 --> 01:28:18,642
We Moved away more and more.

1179
01:28:21,353 --> 01:28:25,191
There must be something here to tell us what to do now.

1180
01:28:26,943 --> 01:28:28,361
So I find him.

1181
01:28:28,445 --> 01:28:30,488
Do I Find It? Fuck you.

1182
01:28:30,572 --> 01:28:34,116
You know that. You tell us.

1183
01:28:34,199 --> 01:28:35,618
Listen,

1184
01:28:35,659 --> 01:28:39,038
DOD needs me to be here.

1185
01:28:39,121 --> 01:28:41,332
So enough question.

1186
01:28:43,292 --> 01:28:45,753
A Peter was not given access on board Until tonight.

1187
01:28:53,010 --> 01:28:54,887
You Knew.

1188
01:28:57,473 --> 01:28:59,392
You Knew esta was coming,

1189
01:28:59,476 --> 01:29:01,352
and did not tell us.

1190
01:29:01,435 --> 01:29:03,437
He Could not.

1191
01:29:03,520 --> 01:29:06,941
- I was following orders ... - Fuck you and your orders.

1192
01:29:08,901 --> 01:29:10,653
Damn.

1193
01:29:10,736 --> 01:29:12,154
You could at Least Have alerted us.

1194
01:29:12,196 --> 01:29:14,156
I Could not Get Involved, right?

1195
01:29:14,240 --> 01:29:15,491
I Could have changed the outcome.

1196
01:29:15,574 --> 01:29:17,910
Oh, dear, why do you keep saying "result"?

1197
01:29:30,296 --> 01:29:31,756
Damn.

1198
01:29:33,467 --> 01:29:35,970
What do you mean by "outcome"?

1199
01:29:36,053 --> 01:29:38,222
I do not know ...

1200
01:29:39,848 --> 01:29:41,600
but I'll find out.

1201
01:30:04,622 --> 01:30:07,208
A submarine is not a good place to keep secrets, Garmin.

1202
01:30:10,963 --> 01:30:14,258
All right. You want answers?

1203
01:30:14,341 --> 01:30:15,718
You CAN HAVE them, okay.

1204
01:30:15,759 --> 01:30:20,055
Yes, you ordered me to observe, document and report, Understand?

1205
01:30:20,097 --> 01:30:22,057
And do not get Involved.

1206
01:30:22,141 --> 01:30:24,183
Yeah yeah. I think That So far as I Understood your plan.

1207
01:30:24,225 --> 01:30:26,352
Observe, document, report not Involved.

1208
01:30:26,436 --> 01:30:27,729
Is there anything more

1209
01:30:27,770 --> 01:30:30,565
after we fuck with your precious government plan?

1210
01:30:30,648 --> 01:30:33,401
I was supposed to be here, okay?

1211
01:30:33,443 --> 01:30:36,446
I had no idea ... They Knew

1212
01:30:36,529 --> 01:30:38,406
and did not tell me.

1213
01:30:38,489 --> 01:30:40,742
It sucks Being on the other end, is not it?

1214
01:30:40,783 --> 01:30:42,577
Happy? It sucks, right.

1215
01:30:42,660 --> 01:30:45,495
But i know that it was Necessary, yes?

1216
01:30:45,579 --> 01:30:47,956
If I Knew That I must be here alone,

1217
01:30:48,040 --> 01:30:50,208
Well, I could ... I Could do something.

1218
01:30:50,292 --> 01:30:51,584
I Could do nothing.

1219
01:30:51,667 --> 01:30:55,087
So either way, it's better to let things happen

1220
01:30:55,129 --> 01:30:56,756
so the story does not change.

1221
01:30:56,839 --> 01:30:59,884
This ... This is too critical.

1222
01:30:59,967 --> 01:31:02,970
- What's so critical? - Think about it.

1223
01:31:03,054 --> 01:31:06,557
Lionfish crew would report tomorrow.

1224
01:31:08,601 --> 01:31:12,897
Are we the crew of Lionfish in 1943?

1225
01:31:12,939 --> 01:31:14,565
We did not know any of the details.

1226
01:31:14,607 --> 01:31:18,110
All we know is That it Happened and we know the result.

1227
01:31:18,194 --> 01:31:20,821
It is too late. We Already helped.

1228
01:31:20,905 --> 01:31:22,198
And changed the rules.

1229
01:31:22,281 --> 01:31:23,824
You changed history.

1230
01:31:35,586 --> 01:31:37,463
Are you serious?

1231
01:31:39,548 --> 01:31:42,551
Is this why are we here?

1232
01:31:42,635 --> 01:31:46,472
Sorry, I will not be waiting to die down here.

1233
01:31:46,556 --> 01:31:49,599
I will not leave everything to fate. I'm going to tell Peter.

1234
01:31:49,641 --> 01:31:51,476
No, no, no. Hey, hey, hey.

1235
01:31:51,560 --> 01:31:52,602
Peter can not know.

1236
01:31:52,686 --> 01:31:55,147
We must make sure to do

1237
01:31:55,231 --> 01:31:57,608
Have you done whatever the first time.

1238
01:31:57,650 --> 01:31:59,777
Listen, this is critical, right?

1239
01:31:59,819 --> 01:32:02,530
Peter May not be aware of any of this.

1240
01:32:02,613 --> 01:32:07,076
We have to assume That Happened so far has everything for a reason.

1241
01:32:07,159 --> 01:32:08,480
How do you know I did not tell ya?

1242
01:32:08,494 --> 01:32:09,829
We do not know. But ...

1243
01:32:09,870 --> 01:32:12,290
That suicide believe Grandpa Peter

1244
01:32:12,331 --> 01:32:15,667
is part of the catalyst That prompts Peter to come here.

1245
01:32:15,750 --> 01:32:19,796
It would be much Easier if Peter Knew.

1246
01:32:19,838 --> 01:32:21,965
You can not know.

1247
01:32:22,048 --> 01:32:24,593
Believe me, can not know.

1248
01:32:26,344 --> 01:32:29,056
Well, I do not know how anyone Could make him do anything.

1249
01:32:29,140 --> 01:32:30,349
It is totally furious.

1250
01:32:30,433 --> 01:32:33,352
We have to convinces him. Listen, I have to finish this.

1251
01:32:33,394 --> 01:32:34,979
I have not Heard a single day in your life,

1252
01:32:35,062 --> 01:32:36,898
Why do you think it was going to start now?

1253
01:32:36,981 --> 01:32:39,317
Well, today would be a damn good day to start.

1254
01:32:41,986 --> 01:32:43,069
All right.

1255
01:32:47,741 --> 01:32:50,118
You better be right.

1256
01:32:50,201 --> 01:32:51,578
I am.

1257
01:33:20,065 --> 01:33:21,441
What are we doing?

1258
01:33:24,319 --> 01:33:25,696
We have a mission.

1259
01:33:28,324 --> 01:33:31,118
Yes. A suicide mission, right?

1260
01:33:34,956 --> 01:33:39,334
Is it a suicide or a sacrifice?

1261
01:33:48,511 --> 01:33:52,056
Your Grandfather Knew everything ...

1262
01:33:52,139 --> 01:33:53,933
what Happened today.

1263
01:33:55,685 --> 01:33:58,104
With what you know it,

1264
01:33:58,145 --> 01:34:00,231
Do you Agree That your staff profile?

1265
01:34:06,027 --> 01:34:07,571
Do Not.

1266
01:34:07,612 --> 01:34:09,489
- No. - No.

1267
01:34:19,792 --> 01:34:21,502
You're right, honey.

1268
01:34:23,546 --> 01:34:27,300
That does not match your staff profile.

1269
01:34:37,934 --> 01:34:39,227
You're right.

1270
01:34:40,812 --> 01:34:42,772
It really does not match your profile.

1271
01:34:50,573 --> 01:34:52,074
All right.

1272
01:34:56,370 --> 01:34:58,956
Let's find a way out of esta damn boat, right?

1273
01:34:59,999 --> 01:35:01,249
Are you ready?

1274
01:35:06,755 --> 01:35:08,506
Come over.

1275
01:35:08,590 --> 01:35:09,966
Damn, I love you.

1276
01:35:12,552 --> 01:35:14,846
I know.

1277
01:35:14,888 --> 01:35:16,514
We Will. Walking.

1278
01:35:36,743 --> 01:35:37,827
Okay, folks.

1279
01:35:40,330 --> 01:35:41,498
Do you two know,

1280
01:35:41,581 --> 01:35:45,585
but we have no intention of dying down here in the dark,

1281
01:35:45,669 --> 01:35:48,129
en esta old pig.

1282
01:35:48,213 --> 01:35:50,548
There is something here That We Have overlooked.

1283
01:35:50,632 --> 01:35:53,051
So let's dig again

1284
01:35:53,134 --> 01:35:55,178
and find the answer. Roger That?

1285
01:35:56,887 --> 01:35:59,056
Garmin, feel free.

1286
01:36:01,351 --> 01:36:02,435
OK.

1287
01:36:16,241 --> 01:36:17,492
Wait, wait, wait.

1288
01:36:17,576 --> 01:36:19,869
What? What did you find?

1289
01:36:19,911 --> 01:36:23,290
Apparently, Lionfish was Attacked by His Own task force.

1290
01:36:23,373 --> 01:36:26,250
Really? I thought I already was clear.

1291
01:36:26,292 --> 01:36:30,421
They thought throwing They Were German submarine depth charges.

1292
01:36:30,504 --> 01:36:32,756
So They think they're the Germans.

1293
01:36:32,798 --> 01:36:34,592
- Yes. - And They Will not stop bombarding

1294
01:36:34,633 --> 01:36:36,469
- Until we're dead. - Yup.

1295
01:36:36,553 --> 01:36:38,847
Well, can not we talk radio or something,

1296
01:36:38,930 --> 01:36:42,058
- And tell them That we are Americans? - Yeah, I wish it Were That Easy.

1297
01:36:42,100 --> 01:36:45,562
- The Radio does not work esta depth. - Wait, wait.

1298
01:36:45,645 --> 01:36:48,857
Like we can Communicate with them yet.

1299
01:36:48,940 --> 01:36:50,150
Well, how?

1300
01:36:51,734 --> 01:36:54,236
An old trick of submariners.

1301
01:36:54,320 --> 01:36:57,907
Firing a load of water-through the torpedo tube

1302
01:36:57,948 --> 01:37:01,243
Filled With bacon grease, oil, meat offal,

1303
01:37:01,285 --> 01:37:03,245
trash, uniforms, jackets.

1304
01:37:03,287 --> 01:37:05,706
Anything above deceive the enemy

1305
01:37:05,789 --> 01:37:08,918
and make them believe They Were dead.

1306
01:37:08,959 --> 01:37:12,005
But that's not what we do.

1307
01:37:12,088 --> 01:37:13,173
Is not it?

1308
01:37:13,256 --> 01:37:15,091
Do Not.

1309
01:37:15,133 --> 01:37:18,220
We want you to know That we are alive.

1310
01:37:18,303 --> 01:37:22,348
We want you to know That we are Americans.

1311
01:37:22,431 --> 01:37:25,226
How do we do that?

1312
01:37:39,657 --> 01:37:40,658
State of the art.

1313
01:37:43,994 --> 01:37:45,287
Ok.

1314
01:37:45,329 --> 01:37:47,289
The flag ...

1315
01:37:47,331 --> 01:37:48,791
let me check this.

1316
01:37:48,832 --> 01:37:51,293
That goes. It is good. No need to put that in there.

1317
01:37:51,335 --> 01:37:53,128
The tablets do not go.

1318
01:37:53,170 --> 01:37:54,713
- Peter. - You know what? Take ...

1319
01:37:54,797 --> 01:37:56,173
- Peter. - Yup?

1320
01:37:56,257 --> 01:37:58,300
Your tablets.

1321
01:37:58,384 --> 01:37:59,843
Yeah, what about my tablets?

1322
01:37:59,885 --> 01:38:01,136
Put them in the box.

1323
01:38:01,178 --> 01:38:02,513
What do you say, are you crazy?

1324
01:38:02,555 --> 01:38:06,600
- No, have all my research. - Peter, I think you need to hear.

1325
01:38:06,684 --> 01:38:08,269
We have enough things. Close it.

1326
01:38:08,352 --> 01:38:10,062
Hey, is not open to discussion.

1327
01:38:10,145 --> 01:38:11,355
You can not be serious.

1328
01:38:11,438 --> 01:38:13,482
Why the hell would want my tablets?

1329
01:38:13,566 --> 01:38:15,650
You can not send future technology of the past.

1330
01:38:15,692 --> 01:38:16,943
Mike, and to help.

1331
01:38:17,026 --> 01:38:18,026
They will not go.

1332
01:38:18,027 --> 01:38:19,654
Put them in the box.

1333
01:38:19,696 --> 01:38:21,407
That is rubbish. I do not take your orders.

1334
01:38:21,490 --> 01:38:23,492
Peter, listen.

1335
01:38:23,576 --> 01:38:24,827
Really?

1336
01:38:26,870 --> 01:38:29,373
Put your tablets in the box now.

1337
01:38:29,456 --> 01:38:30,874
Really?

1338
01:38:30,916 --> 01:38:31,917
Garmin, what are you doing?

1339
01:38:32,001 --> 01:38:33,377
Put them in the box.

1340
01:38:33,419 --> 01:38:35,337
Garmin, what do you do?

1341
01:38:35,379 --> 01:38:37,673
Put your tablets in the box.

1342
01:38:37,715 --> 01:38:38,716
Peter, I ...

1343
01:38:38,799 --> 01:38:40,175
What?

1344
01:38:40,217 --> 01:38:42,969
I think you need to trust That I knows what I's doing.

1345
01:38:46,557 --> 01:38:49,351
Rely on the guy with the gun pointed at my chest?

1346
01:38:51,729 --> 01:38:53,439
Show him the letter. He needs to know.

1347
01:38:53,522 --> 01:38:54,523
I need to know why?

1348
01:38:54,565 --> 01:38:56,860
Please, someone tell me what the hell is going on.

1349
01:38:56,902 --> 01:38:58,778
- What? - Garmin, show him the letter.

1350
01:39:02,032 --> 01:39:03,700
Is your grandfather left the note.

1351
01:39:09,414 --> 01:39:11,373
"Dear Mr. Williams,

1352
01:39:11,415 --> 01:39:15,044
our situation, the situation of our country, you've Become urgent.

1353
01:39:15,085 --> 01:39:17,296
And I must resist.

1354
01:39:17,379 --> 01:39:19,089
You Were Not sure why brought` to help,

1355
01:39:19,173 --> 01:39:21,175
but the events of the last 24 hours,

1356
01:39:21,258 --> 01:39:23,219
fill me with hope for a win.

1357
01:39:23,260 --> 01:39:26,889
Not without sacrifice, But Also victory.

1358
01:39:26,972 --> 01:39:29,767
The heroic actions aboard Performed esta boat

1359
01:39:29,808 --> 01:39:33,146
I have proven That Certain chain of events Should Occur,

1360
01:39:33,230 --> 01:39:35,899
and now I must play a role.

1361
01:39:35,982 --> 01:39:39,276
I can not abandon my duty and service to my country.

1362
01:39:39,360 --> 01:39:42,780
Not doing this for selfish Reasons, but With clear and steady mind.

1363
01:39:42,821 --> 01:39:47,076
My command and my place is With The Lionfish.

1364
01:39:47,117 --> 01:39:50,204
I can not fail, nor ignore the needs of many

1365
01:39:50,287 --> 01:39:52,164
Who Have paid the ultimate sacrifice

1366
01:39:52,248 --> 01:39:54,750
By His countrymen and country.

1367
01:39:54,833 --> 01:39:59,296
I do this now so my boat That May be In Their hands,

1368
01:39:59,338 --> 01:40:01,757
along With The fate of His crew and Their country.

1369
01:40:01,799 --> 01:40:05,261
Sincerely, Tony Sterling ".

1370
01:40:12,977 --> 01:40:15,646
All right. Give me the box.

1371
01:40:53,642 --> 01:40:55,519
The first switch.

1372
01:40:55,561 --> 01:40:56,561
All Right. Done.

1373
01:40:56,562 --> 01:40:57,646
Well, here we go.

1374
01:40:57,688 --> 01:40:59,607
Fuego.

1375
01:40:59,690 --> 01:41:02,358
- Garmin, what the fuck is wrong? - Not enough compressed air.

1376
01:41:02,442 --> 01:41:03,526
Son of a bitch.

1377
01:41:03,610 --> 01:41:05,904
Can not we generate more air?

1378
01:41:17,249 --> 01:41:19,001
Stace, are you okay?

1379
01:41:19,043 --> 01:41:20,169
- Stace? - Go back to the control room.

1380
01:41:20,210 --> 01:41:22,338
¿Stace?

1381
01:41:22,379 --> 01:41:23,964
- Baby, are you okay? - Yup.

1382
01:41:25,672 --> 01:41:28,008
Well, listen ...

1383
01:41:28,050 --> 01:41:29,508
Okay, we will. Forward, forward.

1384
01:41:29,550 --> 01:41:30,911
We'll be there. Come on, come on, come on.

1385
01:41:35,264 --> 01:41:36,349
We Will.

1386
01:41:46,192 --> 01:41:47,318
Watch your step.

1387
01:41:48,736 --> 01:41:50,363
We need more power.

1388
01:41:50,446 --> 01:41:52,532
We don 't have enough to go the compressor.

1389
01:41:52,574 --> 01:41:54,243
Move, move, move, move.

1390
01:41:55,494 --> 01:41:56,494
Fuck.

1391
01:41:58,955 --> 01:42:00,039
How much do we Have?

1392
01:42:00,081 --> 01:42:02,833
Not enough amps to turn on my flashlight bitch.

1393
01:42:05,920 --> 01:42:07,380
Guys, we're screwed.

1394
01:42:09,757 --> 01:42:11,342
I can fix this.

1395
01:42:11,425 --> 01:42:12,425
Huh?

1396
01:42:12,426 --> 01:42:14,262
No, I can. I can fix this.

1397
01:42:14,345 --> 01:42:16,681
Listen, the batteries are connected

1398
01:42:16,764 --> 01:42:18,307
a number, to get maximum voltage.

1399
01:42:18,391 --> 01:42:20,726
We just need to move the compressor, not the whole ship.

1400
01:42:20,768 --> 01:42:22,478
Bote.

1401
01:42:22,562 --> 01:42:26,064
All You Have to do is connect the battery cables in parallel,

1402
01:42:26,147 --> 01:42:29,485
and we can extract enough amps to leave the compressor.

1403
01:42:29,569 --> 01:42:30,569
It's just pretty.

1404
01:42:31,571 --> 01:42:33,531
Is that possible?

1405
01:42:35,241 --> 01:42:37,994
Yeah yeah. It is.

1406
01:42:38,077 --> 01:42:40,871
What are you waiting for? A damn Medal of Honor?

1407
01:42:40,955 --> 01:42:42,873
Go. I will prepared the compressor.

1408
01:42:42,957 --> 01:42:46,085
Stace, come with me. We must lower the battery compartment.

1409
01:42:54,759 --> 01:42:55,969
It's very dark down.

1410
01:43:06,898 --> 01:43:07,899
What's this?

1411
01:43:23,705 --> 01:43:26,082
Stace, do me favor ... your flashlight shines.

1412
01:43:26,166 --> 01:43:29,586
Hey, left. No, the other left.

1413
01:43:29,669 --> 01:43:30,670
Okay, listen ...

1414
01:43:30,754 --> 01:43:33,548
There is a network toolbox. You give me a key, will you?

1415
01:43:36,092 --> 01:43:37,092
We Will.

1416
01:43:37,093 --> 01:43:39,597
Toma.

1417
01:43:40,640 --> 01:43:41,640
Hold on.

1418
01:43:44,769 --> 01:43:46,687
God, are you okay? - Are you okay?

1419
01:43:46,771 --> 01:43:48,688
- Yes. - Tell Garmin That there are still ...

1420
01:43:48,772 --> 01:43:51,733
electricity in the system. Need to press the first switch.

1421
01:43:51,816 --> 01:43:53,360
Cut the main fuse.

1422
01:43:53,443 --> 01:43:54,778
Well, Preparense.

1423
01:43:56,863 --> 01:43:59,032
Garmin, cut the main fuse.

1424
01:44:03,870 --> 01:44:05,039
Try it now.

1425
01:44:06,082 --> 01:44:07,458

01:46:06,826 --> 01:46:09,955
This prom boat did not go as planned, right?

1463
01:46:09,996 --> 01:46:11,331
Life is an adventure, friend.

1464
01:46:11,414 --> 01:46:12,999
Go yes.

1465
01:46:16,920 --> 01:46:18,255

01:46:21,174 --> 01:46:22,801

1473
01:46:42,487 --> 01:46:43,905
Damn.

1480
01:47:23,820 --> 01:47:24,946
What?

1481
01:47:26,197 --> 01:47:27,574
Mikey ...

1482
01:47:29,075 --> 01:47:30,409
did not survive.

1483
01:47:34,079 --> 01:47:36,540
Are you okay? Are you okay?

1484
01:47:37,583 --> 01:47:38,667
OK.

1485
01:47:39,752 --> 01:47:40,753
I did not survive.

1486
01:47:40,836 --> 01:47:42,087
All right. All right.

1487
01:47:43,631 --> 01:47:45,091
- Go, go, go. - Okay.

1488
01:48:02,441 --> 01:48:05,319
PIPE STAND READY

01:48:06,904 --> 01:48:08,530
That's it. Yup.

1490
01:48:08,614 --> 01:48:10,115
You better functions. Come on.

1491
01:48:21,294 --> 01:48:22,754

Thank You.

1493
01:48:40,688 --> 01:48:41,688
Keep it right.

1494
01:48:41,730 --> 01:48:42,856
You're almost there.

1495
01:48:42,940 --> 01:48:44,066

1496
01:48:45,526 --> 01:48:46,819
Come on, Jack, find Him.

1497
01:48:46,902 --> 01:48:48,153
What do we Have?

1498
01:49:02,209 --> 01:49:04,128
We Will. Walking.

1499
01:49:19,476 --> 01:49:20,894
Where are you, Grandpa?

1500
01:49:47,922 --> 01:49:49,965

1502
01:49:54,386 --> 01:49:57,056
At 298 yards, we spoil.

1503
01:49:58,807 --> 01:50:00,726
Watcher to port. Extend positions.

1504
01:50:00,809 --> 01:50:02,811
Search for survivors.

1505
01:50:02,895 --> 01:50:04,605
Watcher to port, extended positions.

1506
01:50:04,688 --> 01:50:06,983
- Search for survivors. - What do you see, Jack?

1507
01:50:07,067 --> 01:50:11,071
Holy shit, Jack. Is that an American flag?

1508
01:50:11,154 --> 01:50:12,822
- Good God. - 091,

Ceasefire. Ceasefire.

01:50:17,034 --> 01:50:19,411
Heavens, Jack. What do we Have?

1512
01:50:19,453 --> 01:50:21,455
It is an American submarine. It has to be.

1513
01:50:21,539 --> 01:50:22,540
I saw the American flag.

1514
01:50:22,623 --> 01:50:24,708
Open your eyes, see if there are survivors.

1515
01:50:24,792 --> 01:50:25,876
Open your eyes if there are survivors.

1516
01:50:25,960 --> 01:50:27,253
Jack, I can not believe ...

1517
01:50:28,420 --> 01:50:29,630
Do you see anything else, Jack?

1518
01:50:29,713 --> 01:50:30,881
Nothing, nothing.

1519
01:50:30,965 --> 01:50:32,550
I have a couple of life ...

1520
01:50:32,591 --> 01:50:33,717
Damn.

1521
01:50:33,801 --> 01:50:34,885
I see no one.

1522
01:50:34,927 --> 01:50:36,847
No survivors. No survivors yet.

1523
01:50:38,722 --> 01:50:40,225
Open your eyes If They see people.

1524
01:51:32,902 --> 01:51:34,069
What?

1525
01:51:35,905 --> 01:51:37,615
We did the spell, Dorothy,

1526
01:51:37,698 --> 01:51:40,241
but we're not back in Kansas.

1527
01:51:43,036 --> 01:51:44,913
I do not ... I do not understand.

1528

01:51:46,539 --> 01:51:47,624
Yes, I know not.

Do not you know?

1531
01:51:48,833 --> 01:51:51,003
I do not know.

1532
01:51:51,086 --> 01:51:53,756
- Something Happened must have. - Well, well.

1533
01:51:53,839 --> 01:51:55,466
What? Did I miss something?

1534
01:51:57,593 --> 01:51:59,720
Something Happened.

1535
01:52:00,930 --> 01:52:03,182
Should you be out already.

1536
01:52:03,265 --> 01:52:05,974
We shouldnt stay here.

1537
01:52:06,058 --> 01:52:08,351
That is, do not you ...?

1538
01:52:08,392 --> 01:52:09,977
You do not ...

1539
01:52:10,019 --> 01:52:12,104
you do not know what will happen?

1540
01:52:15,942 --> 01:52:17,485
You mean that's it?

1541
01:52:19,487 --> 01:52:20,988
- Are we ...? - Come over.

1542
01:52:21,072 --> 01:52:22,072
Are we dead?

1543
01:52:23,366 --> 01:52:24,492
We Will.

1544
01:52:24,575 --> 01:52:26,245
All is well.

1545
01:52:56,649 --> 01:52:58,276
Mr. Garmin.

Roger That?

1550
01:53:43,988 --> 01:53:47,074

1551
01:53:47,116 --> 01:53:48,451

1552
01:53:48,492 --> 01:53:50,369

We deny any de este That Happened.

1554

Millions of Lives Depend on you.

1556
01:54:01,046 --> 01:54:03,965
Not only saved a Boat with soldiers.

1557
01:54:04,007 --> 01:54:05,967
You are an intelligent man, Professor.

1558
01:54:06,009 --> 01:54:07,344
Think for a minute.

1559
01:54:07,427 --> 01:54:10,222
Your tablet was sent to the laboratory and analyzed.

1560
01:54:10,305 --> 01:54:12,516
Not only the computer,

1561
01:54:12,600 --> 01:54:15,519
but all the documentation of His research on the war years.

1562
01:54:15,603 --> 01:54:18,439
But the next day When They caught That box,

1563
01:54:18,481 --> 01:54:20,608
container containing your tablet and laptop computer ...

1564
01:54:20,691 --> 01:54:22,151
Yup.

1565
01:54:22,235 --> 01:54:23,945
That was light years beyond anything

1566
01:54:24,028 --> 01:54:25,779
Could have we dreamed in 1943.

1567
01:54:25,820 --> 01:54:30,951
Met Implementing massive leaps in technology.

1568

made us win World War II, Peter.

1570
01:54:38,708 --> 01:54:41,044
But ...

1571
01:54:41,127 --> 01:54:43,630
Lionfish.

1572
01:54:43,713 --> 01:54:44,965

I do not know what to say.

1578
01:55:08,948 --> 01:55:11,617
Peter, you were right.

1579
01:55:11,701 --> 01:55:13,661
Your grandfather itself was special.

1580
01:55:16,372 --> 01:55:18,291
I thought you Might want this back.

1581
01:55:19,375 --> 01:55:21,209

Go.

1583
01:55:29,051 --> 01:55:30,177
Hey, you can keep it.

I do not think you need it.

1585
01:55:32,305 --> 01:55:34,223
Also I thought you'd say that.

1586
01:55:36,517 --> 01:55:39,520
Funny how in Original old stories never die either, eh?

1587
01:55:39,604 --> 01:55:40,980
Yup.

1588
01:55:42,106 --> 01:55:43,399
Do not worry.

1589
01:55:43,482 --> 01:55:45,568
