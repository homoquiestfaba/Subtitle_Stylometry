1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
SSA:Wait for audio trigger

2
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:42,520
The joint for the right arm is weak on this 96.

3
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:44,270
Just like the real thing.

4
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:46,150
I'm amazed at Banpure models.

5
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:53,490
Shinji.

6
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:03,160
Summer!

7
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:05,830
The beach!

8
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:07,380
And

9
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,880
One summer

10
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:10,500
One summer

11
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:13,340
One summer

12
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:25,980
The experience of the summer... Why
does it turn out like this?

13
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:28,150
Well, it is in the same district.

14
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:29,020
Listen to me!

15
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,530
We were supposed to go
to the beach in Kujyukiri!

16
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:32,400
Onjyuku!

17
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,240
The white beach!

18
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,150
The desert of the moon!

19
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:35,820
Camels!

20
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:39,030
There seems to be no
security problems here.

21
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:41,080
Stop messing around and come.

22
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:42,790
It's him.

23
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,540
It's his fault isn't it?

24
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:47,460
If you didn't like it so much,
you didn't have to come.

25
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:53,550
Yeah, yeah, you should've refused when
Sagara agreed to go with Kazama.

26
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:58,890
You're a high school student though,
you shouldn't ditch your friends just
because you're a little uncomfortable.

27
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:03,890
This might be more exciting than the beach.

28
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:06,770
Maybe some handsome BS pilot
will come up to you and go...

29
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:08,310
Want to BS with me?

30
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:10,270
What if something like that happened?

31
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:13,480
You mean AS right?

32
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:18,700
We will avenge our loss
from the Chuuton festival.

33
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:24,620
The team that challenged us is named the
Red Dragons, but it is full of stupid fools.

34
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:26,620
We'll show them hell.

35
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:28,870
I wish you all a good fight.

36
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,210
That is all

37
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:32,130
Board the mechs.

38
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:33,420
Yeah!

39
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,480
This is prime grade Nerima daikon.

40
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:51,940
Here...

41
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,480
Why don't you try it out?

42
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:57,820
The training demonstration by
the soldiers is about to begin.

43
00:03:58,070 --> 00:03:59,200
Be sure to watch everyone.

44
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,780
Man, you look ridiculous.

45
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:03,240
This is cardboard.

46
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:05,410
The real ones look cool.

47
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:07,620
You're going to lose again this year right?

48
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:09,750
Let's go.

49
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:10,330
Yeah.

50
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:13,630
Jeez, even the little kids make fun of them.

51
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:17,590
The AS troop is weak as hell.

52
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:20,130
Do they have a problem with their equipment?

53
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:24,470
No, they have the best
equipment in the army.

54
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:26,260
Then why are they weak?

55
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,100
All they have is good equipment, nothing else.

56
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:31,980
Shinji.

57
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:34,730
Dad.

58
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:37,070
You are Sagara?

59
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:39,320
Yes.

60
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:40,900
I'm Sergeant Sagara.

61
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,820
I mean, nice to meet you.

62
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:46,910
I'm Kazama Shintaro.

63
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,080
I'm the commander here.

64
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:53,460
This is the first time that Shinji has
brought a friend along to this festival.

65
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,500
You don't need to say useless things.

66
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,630
I mean, he's a boy like this.

67
00:04:57,670 --> 00:04:59,170
Sometimes I get worried.

68
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:00,800
Dad, quit it.

69
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:02,970
Please, do have a good time today.

70
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:04,050
Yes.

71
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:04,970
Commander!

72
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:08,640
An unusual boy.

73
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,850
He's formal, almost like a man in the military.

74
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:19,860
He's pretty skillful.

75
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:22,780
I should have gotten it without the aonori.

76
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,610
If it gets on my teeth, it'll
be harder to pick up men.

77
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:27,200
Kana-chan, want some?

78
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:29,870
Hey.

79
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:32,750
Where are you girls from?

80
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:34,670
Yes

81
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,330
From Sengawa.

82
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,210
What a coincidence.

83
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:39,960
I'm from Nerima.

84
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:42,130
Sengawa is very close by.

85
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:42,630
Who is this?

86
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:44,300
Yep, almost the same city.

87
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:44,130
He's sort of scary.

88
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:47,550
If you don't mind, want to AS with me?

89
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:48,470
What?

90
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:52,600
I'll show you the magnificence
of the Nerima Red Dragons.

91
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:54,060
Nerima daikon?

92
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:55,190
No!

93
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:58,270
Nerima Red Dragons, the Red Dragons.

94
00:05:58,730 --> 00:05:59,440
How about it?

95
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,480
Of course.

96
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:02,440
I want to ride.

97
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:05,030
My name is Akagi Ryunosuke.

98
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,200
You are?

99
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:09,660
I don't really like AS's

100
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:12,200
And also people who are crazy about them.

101
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:13,790
No need to worry.

102
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:16,120
I'll teach you everything
if you know what I mean.

103
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:17,670
No thank you.

104
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:21,300
Wow, what a graceful way to get angry.

105
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,670
Commander...

106
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:24,380
It's time.

107
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,590
Understood.

108
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,800
Please excuse me.

109
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:30,800
Damn it, he pisses me off.

110
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:33,010
Why is it Kaname and not me?

111
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:35,850
I'm not going to get my revenge.

112
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:37,440
Why does it turn out like that?

113
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,030
Everyone seems down.

114
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,200
Did something happen?

115
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,200
Shut up!

116
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:56,710
Let us begin today's Chuuton festival's main event.

117
00:06:56,100 --> 00:07:03,630
Various competitive games by the
troops of the Nerima training grounds.

118
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:05,340
Here they come.

119
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,590
Akagi!

120
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:11,760
We're going to win this year!

121
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:13,970
What are you joking about?

122
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:17,310
You guys are pathetic compared
to the Nerima Red Dragons.

123
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:19,520
Nerima daikon...

124
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,520
I won't forgive him.

125
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:32,320
We'll finish it in one blow.

126
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:34,490
Right grip, full power.

127
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:35,910
Right, full power.

128
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:36,700
Ready.

129
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:37,870
Go!

130
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:44,710
Wow, Nerima team is strong again this year.

131
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:48,840
More like Narashino is too weak?

132
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:50,340
I told you.

133
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,430
They are weak.

134
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,850
Damn, still weak?

135
00:07:55,890 --> 00:07:57,010
Narashino is staying very close.

136
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:59,180
This year, it's down to the anchor.

137
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:03,730
Increase power.

138
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:05,650
We can't go any faster than this.

139
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:07,110
You are weak.

140
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:08,650
Take off the limiter.

141
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:09,440
Removing!

142
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:14,450
A strong hit.

143
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:16,200
Nerima wins again.

144
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,620
Nerima, you're dirty.

145
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:20,040
Kazama.

146
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,170
The opponent is a tandem.

147
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,090
They have a slight difference
in their synchronization.

148
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:35,760
That will be our chance.

149
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:38,220
We're on a tandem too.

150
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:40,270
Get ready for a smash.

151
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:41,640
Roger.

152
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:45,850
Sir, they're coming.

153
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,400
Their drive smash.

154
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:53,860
What?!

155
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:56,370
It's a feint.

156
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:57,740
Go forward.

157
00:08:59,080 --> 00:08:59,700
Pathetic.

158
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,370
No!

159
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:05,120
Again!

160
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:06,880
Don't play so dirty.

161
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:08,380
It's over.

162
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:09,880
Everything.

163
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:14,930
Sir.

164
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:17,550
There's an unmarked AS approaching.

165
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,050
An AS with no name?

166
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:20,010
That's impossible.

167
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:23,600
This AS is going three time
faster than it's normal speed.

168
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:25,270
What?

169
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:29,940
Damn.

170
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:30,900
Wow!

171
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,490
Hey where did Sagara-kun go?

172
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:37,110
It can't be.

173
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,030
Listen to me Nerima Daikon.

174
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:41,910
It's Nerima Red Dragon!

175
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:44,620
This is supposed to be a friendly exhibition.

176
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:45,870
It's not war.

177
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:47,620
Stop using dirty tricks.

178
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:50,380
Step outside.

179
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:55,800
That was a graceful smash.

180
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,640
You, who are you?

181
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,690
I guess it doesn't matter
as long as you pilot an AS.

182
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:08,900
Fine!

183
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,900
I challenge you!

184
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:22,280
Sousuke!

185
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:23,370
What the heck are you doing?!

186
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:26,080
How did you find out my identity?

187
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:29,330
Only you would pull off something like THIS!

188
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:33,710
But since this is a friendly match, I
wanted to teach them about fair play.

189
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:36,090
Damn it!

190
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:38,380
I never should have come!

191
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:40,840
Give me back my fun time at the beach!

192
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:41,720
Here.

193
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:45,010
It must be hot in the GS.

194
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,060
That stands for Group Sounds.

195
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:50,060
That joke is so old.

196
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:52,270
Mizuki, what are you doing?

197
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:54,190
Stop messing with a kid like that...

198
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:55,820
And GS with me.

199
00:10:56,690 --> 00:11:00,400
Although you're wearing a costume,
you must be really handsome inside.

200
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:03,240
Come on, take these off and show me your face.

201
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:07,870
You're being rude to the AS pilot.

202
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:08,700
Let's go!

203
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:10,040
Good luck.

204
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:11,290
Kana-chan.

205
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:16,670
So her name is Kaname.

206
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:19,170
It's so graceful.

207
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:20,880
Kaname-san.

208
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:23,140
Kaname-san!

209
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:29,980
According to the judges, the ping pong
match held earlier will be declared a
draw due to outside interferences.

210
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:33,940
Dad.

211
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:38,690
I didn't know a superb pilot
like you would be in Narashino.

212
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:42,030
I know it's sudden, but I
have a favor to ask of you.

213
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,500
So that's how it is.

214
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:52,500
We have nowhere to run.

215
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:54,250
Commander.

216
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:56,540
Kosuge, why are you hiding this from me?

217
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:00,260
You didn't tell me about
and awesome pilot like him.

218
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:03,340
I beg of you.

219
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:05,680
We have to win against Nerima.

220
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:07,930
Please take command of the forces.

221
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:11,140
What are you doing Dad?

222
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:13,810
Kazama.

223
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:15,980
Why do you lower yourself like that?

224
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:22,530
It's because you were no good at piloting
an AS, so you had to resort to this position.

225
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,360
That's all you could do right?

226
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:27,870
Is that true?

227
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,870
He has no sense of piloting whatsoever.

228
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:35,250
You know why I began to read AS-fan?

229
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,130
I wanted to make sure.

230
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:41,800
Is piloting an AS that hard?

231
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:45,470
Why can't my father do it?

232
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:49,140
I wanted you to pilot an AS.

233
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:53,930
I wanted to say my dad is an AS pilot.

234
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:57,060
Shinji.

235
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:59,150
I hate you Dad!

236
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:03,530
I'm sorry.

237
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:05,110
But...

238
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:07,990
You are forgetting something very important.

239
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:08,990
What?

240
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:13,290
On the battlefield, reinforcements
are very important, and necessary.

241
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:16,870
Without backup, the men in the front lines
cannot perform to their full potential.

242
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:21,460
The one, who commands those
reinforcements, is your father.

243
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:25,300
Well then...

244
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:28,840
Let's grate that piece of Nerima daikon.

245
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,350
Yeah!

246
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:40,610
Did you have a fight with your boyfriend?

247
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:42,400
He's not my boyfriend.

248
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:45,320
So I still have a chance.

249
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:48,240
Do you want to challenge him with me?

250
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:49,450
What?

251
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:57,290
By fighting him just once, I can already
tell that he is a very skillful AS pilot.

252
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:01,210
However, if I'm with you I won't lose.

253
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:03,000
I know I'll win.

254
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:07,300
I think this is a good time to AS with me.

255
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:08,800
What do you think?

256
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:11,090
Can you win?

257
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:12,180
Of course.

258
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,680
I've never made a lady feel regret.

259
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:16,640
Fine, I accept.

260
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:18,640
Thank you for your patience.

261
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:20,940
We will finally begin our
last event, the kiba-sen.

262
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:25,320
In this event, we will judge with special
standards, the winner of this event takes all.

263
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:29,070
Go! Go!

264
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:28,990
Where did everyone go?

265
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:29,860
Who knows.

266
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:31,910
Good luck, Mr. BS pilot.

267
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:36,330
I won't ask you anything about your background.

268
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:37,950
Let's do our best.

269
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,410
I thank you.

270
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:44,920
Since we put Kazama and his son
on one of the machines, we cannot
lose, or they will be blamed.

271
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:46,300
We must win.

272
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:51,260
Inexperienced moves by inexperienced pilots
can sometimes lead to astonishing results.

273
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:52,180
Let's go.

274
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:55,180
Why does it smell in here?

275
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,510
You won't be worrying about that soon.

276
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:00,230
Just like you do in P.E. class.

277
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,020
I'll follow you.

278
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:04,610
Don't touch me.

279
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:07,820
We are about to begin the kiba-sen.

280
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:12,700
It used to be like that.

281
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:18,450
But recently, things haven't
been going well for them.

282
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,330
The other day, they had an
argument like the one earlier.

283
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:25,420
And his son broke one of his precious models.

284
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:28,420
They're teamwork is horrible right now.

285
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:31,420
Teamwork is something that
is forged on the battlefield.

286
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:33,680
We won't know until we fight.

287
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:35,180
Ready?

288
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:41,730
Why am I

289
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:42,640
Dad.

290
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:43,850
I'll pilot.

291
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:44,940
What are you saying?

292
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:46,100
You can't possibly.

293
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:49,440
My friend told me to use this.

294
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,320
What are we going to do?

295
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,360
WHAT are we going to do?

296
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:57,450
It's simple.

297
00:15:57,870 --> 00:16:00,490
Just throw out your punches
like you want to hit someone.

298
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:01,870
Fine.

299
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:03,620
Here we go.

300
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:05,920
Shinji!

301
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:06,540
Load.

302
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:10,130
Wow...

303
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:12,340
This AS is awesome.

304
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:13,720
They evaded.

305
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:14,550
It's fine.

306
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:15,970
You have a good feel for the AS.

307
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:16,840
One more time.

308
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:17,680
I do?

309
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:19,260
Alright then.

310
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:23,430
That commander AS.

311
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:25,560
He's not moving like usual.

312
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:28,770
Kaname-san, HE must be using that AS.

313
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:29,860
Ok.

314
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:31,230
Damn.

315
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:33,230
We can't take their commander AS lightly.

316
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:34,860
He is very skillful.

317
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,240
He is?

318
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:39,120
It seems his punch timings
are different from usual.

319
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:41,030
Troops C, troops D.

320
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:43,370
Cover the Kazama B team.

321
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:45,290
C team, acknowledged.

322
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:46,710
D team, acknowledged.

323
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:48,500
What are we going to do?

324
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,790
This is the point of our plans.

325
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:53,960
If we take out the head of the
dragon, we have a chance to win.

326
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:56,340
This is turning out to be
more exciting than I thought.

327
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:57,470
Acknowledged.

328
00:16:59,090 --> 00:16:59,720
They're coming.

329
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:02,140
St...stop it!

330
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:03,310
Don't worry.

331
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:05,560
We're going to take their commander AS now.

332
00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:06,560
What?

333
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:07,940
Team B, team C.

334
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:09,520
We're going to do the usual.

335
00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:11,900
They're coming.

336
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:14,730
It's the Red Stream Attack.

337
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:15,690
What?

338
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:19,110
Using the AS's as a ramp?!

339
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:24,370
Down by low.

340
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:30,580
We lose to that every year.

341
00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:32,210
Jumping all that weight.

342
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:35,460
Timing, jump ability, and guts

343
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:36,710
they have it all.

344
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:38,720
This feels great.

345
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,430
It'll feel even better when
you defeat the enemy.

346
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:44,350
Don't get close to me though.

347
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:47,180
Dad, the turning on the right side is slow.

348
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:49,850
I can't do anything about that.

349
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,650
Please fall back. We'll stop them here.

350
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:53,940
What are you saying?

351
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:56,190
I can't just leave you guys.

352
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:59,820
I'm always fighting, even if I'm not in an AS.

353
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,360
I'm still part of the team!

354
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:07,160
Narashino team is in a pinch!

355
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:09,710
Are the Red Dragons going to win as predicted?

356
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:12,670
Commander, I bid you good luck.

357
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:16,170
Please show them the spirit of our...

358
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:18,090
Shinji

359
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:20,380
I'm not very skilled.

360
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,840
I can't even fix models that well.

361
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:23,760
But...

362
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:26,810
I can't just retreat like this.

363
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:28,140
I know.

364
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:32,060
Will you fight together with me?

365
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:34,230
Yeah.

366
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:36,730
I will.

367
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:38,530
Ok.

368
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:39,860
We're going to win.

369
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:42,530
Message to the remaining fighters.

370
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:46,280
We're going to grate that
Nerima piece of daikon.

371
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:47,780
Dad!

372
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:48,950
Everyone forward.

373
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:50,580
Begin counterattack!

374
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,210
Yeah!

375
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:55,460
Shinji, ready the left counter.

376
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:57,090
Left counter, acknowledged.

377
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:01,880
What's going on?

378
00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:03,090
I told you.

379
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,970
Teamwork is forged on teh battle field.

380
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:08,640
Hey, we're losing.

381
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:10,850
What's going on?

382
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:12,850
Narashino is coming back.

383
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:16,610
They're fighting back and getting even.

384
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:18,650
We're going to take their commander AS.

385
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:20,690
Everyone, ready?

386
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:21,690
Roger.

387
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:24,530
One more time, the radish jump?

388
00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:26,320
It's the Red Stream Attack.

389
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:30,080
Here they come.

390
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:31,700
Our down by low won't make it in time.

391
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,580
We're not going to make it.

392
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:39,840
The 96's have a weak right joint.

393
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:42,760
Shinji, go for the right arm joint.

394
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:43,630
What?

395
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:44,590
Understood.

396
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:49,800
The arm came off.

397
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:50,810
What?!

398
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:51,720
Now!

399
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:52,930
Roger!

400
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,350
Go to hell!

401
00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:56,810
We're going to win this year!

402
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:01,230
Game set!

403
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:04,070
Surprisingly, Narashino wins!

404
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:09,070
It's like a dream.

405
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:10,450
Thank you.

406
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:11,450
No...

407
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:15,040
You guys just performed at
your full potential, that's all.

408
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:16,540
Dad.

409
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:18,420
We did it.

410
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:19,250
We won.

411
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:26,840
Get away from me.

412
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:29,340
The match is over.

413
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,350
I don't want to admit it but

414
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:34,270
my immaturity made me blind.

415
00:20:34,810 --> 00:20:35,810
You're annoying.

416
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:46,240
I found out today how important
my father's job really is.

417
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:48,280
Thanks Sagara-kun.

418
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:52,370
We were able to win because of you.

419
00:20:53,530 --> 00:20:54,990
It wasn't because of me.

420
00:20:56,450 --> 00:20:59,330
It was because of your father,
and the Narashino troops.

421
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,670
Me. BS pilot...

422
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:05,460
My...

423
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:12,180
Where are my summer memories?
