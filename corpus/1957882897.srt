1
00:00:12,379 --> 00:00:16,183
I can't breathe!
I can't breathe!

2
00:00:27,795 --> 00:00:30,632
You know that movie's
gonna suck, right?

3
00:00:30,665 --> 00:00:33,033
How you know it's gonna suck?

4
00:00:33,066 --> 00:00:34,536
You know who that guy is?

5
00:00:34,569 --> 00:00:37,639
Yes,
that's John David Washington.

6
00:00:37,672 --> 00:00:39,439
Washington, right.

7
00:00:39,473 --> 00:00:41,876
How you think Mr. Washington
got that part?

8
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:45,045
-Showed up to an audition,
did a good job--
-Audition.

9
00:00:45,078 --> 00:00:47,481
That's Denzel Washington's son,
dude.

10
00:00:47,515 --> 00:00:49,951
He doesn't audition
for anything.

11
00:00:49,984 --> 00:00:52,052
It's called nepotism.

12
00:00:52,085 --> 00:00:54,288
If you don't know anybody,

13
00:00:54,321 --> 00:00:55,623
then you don't get anything.

14
00:00:57,525 --> 00:00:59,393
You even know
who your father is?

15
00:01:00,728 --> 00:01:04,064
Fuck you, fuck 12,
fuck Hollywood.

16
00:01:04,097 --> 00:01:06,366
Get out there and protest, bro.
Come on.

17
00:01:09,737 --> 00:01:12,205
Hey, the movie
might not be good, but...

18
00:01:14,241 --> 00:01:16,076
shit, it'd be better
if I was in it.

19
00:01:54,048 --> 00:01:56,017
Yeah, obviously, I would've
taken the chopper and all,

20
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:58,886
but, I mean, all the seats
were sold out.

21
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:02,356
And, you know, with Kobe--
God damn, RIP to him--

22
00:02:02,389 --> 00:02:04,592
it's just too soon, baby,
it's just too soon.

23
00:02:04,626 --> 00:02:07,929
But fuck me, I can't wait
to get out of this city.

24
00:02:07,962 --> 00:02:10,297
Yeah, the fuckin' protesters
are all over the place,

25
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:11,599
just marching around and shit.

26
00:02:11,633 --> 00:02:13,266
I mean, it's like,
give it up already.

27
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,636
You guys won, okay?

28
00:02:14,669 --> 00:02:16,104
You all matter.

29
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:17,371
Oh, hold on,
hold on, baby.

30
00:02:17,404 --> 00:02:19,040
I gotta do something real quick.

31
00:02:24,812 --> 00:02:26,814
Yeah, you still there, sweetie?

32
00:02:26,848 --> 00:02:28,482
Yeah, I can't wait.

33
00:02:41,361 --> 00:02:42,830
Hey, hey.

34
00:02:42,864 --> 00:02:44,565
- What the...?
- Fuck!

35
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:46,166
Get him!

36
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:47,401
Get him!

37
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:03,851
Ho-ho-ho-ho.

38
00:03:03,885 --> 00:03:06,186
Damn, it's kinda heavy.

39
00:03:06,219 --> 00:03:08,589
No, no, no, no, no.
Be--be--be smart.

40
00:03:20,134 --> 00:03:22,036
Hey, NYPD!

41
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:24,337
- Face the wall, face the wall!
Against the fuckin' wall!

42
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:25,707
Spread your fuckin' legs!

43
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:27,875
Listen to what I fuckin' say
to you, huh.

44
00:03:27,909 --> 00:03:30,144
What the fuck you doing?
I saw you with something, huh.

45
00:03:30,178 --> 00:03:31,344
What's in it?
What you got?

46
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:33,081
You got some drugs?
I saw something.

47
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:36,884
Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho.

48
00:03:36,918 --> 00:03:38,886
-What's this?
-It's nothing.

49
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:41,321
-What is this?
-It's... my grandmother's.

50
00:03:41,354 --> 00:03:44,859
Yeah sure, it's your grandma's.
It's mine now, cocksucker!

51
00:03:44,892 --> 00:03:46,460
It's gonna look great
on my wife.

52
00:03:46,493 --> 00:03:49,564
Oh, fuck, typical, man.
Crooked pigs.

53
00:03:49,597 --> 00:03:51,899
Hey, you put your hands
on your head,

54
00:03:51,933 --> 00:03:53,868
or I will light you up!

55
00:03:53,901 --> 00:03:57,004
I hear the virus is raging up
in Rikers, motherfucker.

56
00:04:10,017 --> 00:04:11,085
Dude.

57
00:04:11,119 --> 00:04:12,754
Dude, are--are you okay?

58
00:04:12,787 --> 00:04:14,922
You need me to call somebody,
an ambulance or something?

59
00:04:14,956 --> 00:04:17,558
-Stop the--
-You fuckin' prick,
don't fuckin' touch me.

60
00:04:17,592 --> 00:04:19,694
I'm gonna fuckin' kill you.

61
00:04:19,727 --> 00:04:21,261
Hey, man.

62
00:04:21,294 --> 00:04:23,564
- No no, I'm trying
to help you out.

63
00:04:23,598 --> 00:04:25,233
I don't need your help,
nigger.

64
00:04:29,369 --> 00:04:30,403
Fine.

65
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:33,975
-Shit.
-Fuckin' pig.

66
00:05:27,995 --> 00:05:30,631
♪ Come to me, mama
Oh, yeah ♪

67
00:05:30,665 --> 00:05:34,168
♪ Come to me, mama
Right now, right now, yeah ♪

68
00:05:34,202 --> 00:05:36,504
♪ Come on, baby ♪

69
00:05:36,537 --> 00:05:38,471
Anybody ever tell you
you're a cute guy, Gus?

70
00:05:38,506 --> 00:05:41,509
Eh, Jean-Michel, what's--
what the fuck, man?

71
00:05:41,542 --> 00:05:42,977
How you doing?

72
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:44,344
Keep your distance.
I haven't come this far--

73
00:05:44,377 --> 00:05:47,114
I don't have to get sick
from you.

74
00:05:47,148 --> 00:05:49,083
You know, Gus, if you had
one of those masks on,

75
00:05:49,116 --> 00:05:50,483
you'd be a little safer.

76
00:05:50,518 --> 00:05:52,452
I'd be safer, but I wouldn't be
as good looking.

77
00:05:52,485 --> 00:05:54,655
Because I'm trying to keep
those tan lines off.

78
00:05:54,689 --> 00:05:57,792
So, Jean-Michel, you called,
you said you got something
you wanna show me?

79
00:05:57,825 --> 00:05:59,193
Right, right.

80
00:05:59,227 --> 00:06:02,096
Dude, I don't wanna touch that
if it's hot.

81
00:06:02,129 --> 00:06:03,664
I don't wanna get my prints
all over it.

82
00:06:03,698 --> 00:06:05,432
Are you outta your mind?

83
00:06:05,465 --> 00:06:07,001
Dee, da dee, dee,
okay, let me see.

84
00:06:07,034 --> 00:06:08,336
Wait a minute.

85
00:06:09,537 --> 00:06:10,838
This can't be, man.
This is...

86
00:06:10,872 --> 00:06:12,773
This can't be the thing
that I read about.

87
00:06:12,807 --> 00:06:16,844
"Famed necklace stolen
from Christie's during looting."

88
00:06:16,878 --> 00:06:18,980
Holy shit, "It was discovered
on Monday

89
00:06:19,013 --> 00:06:21,282
that during the looting
that took place over
the weekend,

90
00:06:21,315 --> 00:06:23,217
the storage unit for
the auction house Christie's

91
00:06:23,251 --> 00:06:25,953
was broken into
and the items were stolen.

92
00:06:25,987 --> 00:06:28,789
Amongst the stolen items
was a ruby necklace

93
00:06:28,823 --> 00:06:32,793
named The Evening Sun
that was owned by Mary II

94
00:06:32,827 --> 00:06:34,228
that is valued at..."

95
00:06:36,429 --> 00:06:38,132
-Three million bucks?
-Shh!

96
00:06:40,534 --> 00:06:42,469
There's crazy-ass people
around here.

97
00:06:42,503 --> 00:06:44,972
Oh, yes, "Whoever stole this
is going to have

98
00:06:45,006 --> 00:06:46,406
a terrifically difficult time
selling."

99
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:48,042
- Gus, come on, come on.
- Wait!

100
00:06:48,075 --> 00:06:50,044
"A representative
from Christie's said.

101
00:06:50,077 --> 00:06:53,180
The necklace is a museum"--
museum or museum--
"a museum piece."

102
00:06:53,214 --> 00:06:55,683
- Who cares?
 -"Its value lies in its craftsmanship and history.

103
00:06:55,716 --> 00:06:57,885
On top of that,
we have notified--"
this is the problem,

104
00:06:57,919 --> 00:06:59,553
"notified all dealers
and museums

105
00:06:59,587 --> 00:07:01,088
to be on the lookout
for this piece.

106
00:07:01,122 --> 00:07:02,723
We plan to get it back."

107
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:05,492
I don't know.

108
00:07:05,526 --> 00:07:07,328
I think what you need to do
is take it back to Christie's.

109
00:07:07,361 --> 00:07:09,864
I'm pretty sure they have
"anonymous drop", they call it.

110
00:07:09,897 --> 00:07:11,766
They'll give you
some kind of a reward.

111
00:07:11,799 --> 00:07:14,035
I can't take it back
to Christie's, all right, man.

112
00:07:14,068 --> 00:07:15,703
They're not gonna give me
no reward. Just--just...

113
00:07:15,736 --> 00:07:17,738
-Hook me up with somebody...
-All right, Just calm down.

114
00:07:17,772 --> 00:07:19,040
-Would you please calm down.
-...who can give me
some real money for it.

115
00:07:19,073 --> 00:07:20,207
Calm down.

116
00:07:20,241 --> 00:07:21,876
It's okay.

117
00:07:21,909 --> 00:07:23,544
Give me 24 hours.

118
00:07:23,577 --> 00:07:25,079
But, Gus, I'm trying to get
outta town tonight.

119
00:07:25,112 --> 00:07:27,181
Give me 24 hours.
I can't do this in a minute.

120
00:07:27,214 --> 00:07:28,916
Call me.
You have my number?

121
00:07:29,884 --> 00:07:31,218
You got my number?

122
00:07:31,252 --> 00:07:33,621
Yeah, yeah, but I had to
get rid of my phone.

123
00:07:33,654 --> 00:07:36,223
Listen, I'm gonna call you,
but it might be an unknown
number, all right?

124
00:07:36,257 --> 00:07:38,092
Unknown number's fine.

125
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:41,128
I'll work on it.
I will work on it for you.

126
00:07:41,162 --> 00:07:43,197
But you just keep yourself safe
in the meantime.

127
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:44,799
Answer your phone, Gus.

128
00:07:46,233 --> 00:07:47,568
Answer your phone.

129
00:08:09,623 --> 00:08:10,725
Ma?

130
00:08:13,995 --> 00:08:15,262
Ma!

131
00:08:19,433 --> 00:08:21,135
Ma!

132
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:24,171
- Oh, Jean-Michel!
<i>- Bluetooth paired.</i>

133
00:08:24,205 --> 00:08:26,273
What are you doing here?

134
00:08:26,307 --> 00:08:29,643
-Oh God, you startled me.
-I'm sorry, Ma.

135
00:08:29,677 --> 00:08:31,178
I was making some deliveries
in the area.

136
00:08:31,212 --> 00:08:32,980
I wanted to come by, say hi.

137
00:08:33,014 --> 00:08:35,316
You don't have to wear that
mask in here.

138
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:39,153
It's okay. I got my antibodies,
I'm fine.

139
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:42,189
I know you're a superhero,
but I don't wanna get you sick.

140
00:08:42,223 --> 00:08:44,492
I got my antibodies, I'm fine.
Come here.

141
00:08:44,525 --> 00:08:45,826
Of course.

142
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:47,428
I want you to take a look
at this piece.

143
00:08:47,461 --> 00:08:49,263
I wanna get your opinion on it.

144
00:08:49,296 --> 00:08:50,598
Do you know what it is?

145
00:08:50,631 --> 00:08:54,101
No, I honestly have no idea, Ma.

146
00:08:54,135 --> 00:08:57,838
It's the Pope, calling me
into the church.

147
00:08:57,872 --> 00:08:59,440
Yeah, yeah, I see it.

148
00:08:59,473 --> 00:09:01,609
I--uh, I see it.

149
00:09:01,642 --> 00:09:04,879
God never tires
of forgiving us.

150
00:09:04,912 --> 00:09:08,315
We're the ones who tire
of seeking His forgiveness.

151
00:09:08,349 --> 00:09:10,551
Sorry, Mom, what,
what was that?

152
00:09:10,584 --> 00:09:13,487
Oh, ah! it's just something
I've been thinking a lot about

153
00:09:13,522 --> 00:09:15,890
that the pope said.

154
00:09:15,923 --> 00:09:18,292
Hey, are you hungry? I'll make
us some veggie burgers.

155
00:09:18,325 --> 00:09:21,395
No, no no, it's okay.
It's okay, really.

156
00:09:21,429 --> 00:09:23,364
I'm getting outta town
for a few days.

157
00:09:23,397 --> 00:09:25,132
I wanted to see you
before I left.

158
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:26,367
Oh.

159
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,569
So I'm cooking something for us
to eat.

160
00:09:28,602 --> 00:09:30,871
I'm not letting you leave here
without a meal.

161
00:09:30,905 --> 00:09:32,840
Ma, you don't have to cook
for me.

162
00:09:32,873 --> 00:09:34,675
And then you can tell me all
about this trip you're about
to go on.

163
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:37,445
-You don't have to cook.
-I said I'm cooking.

164
00:10:00,734 --> 00:10:02,603
Listen, son, I'm going away
for a while,

165
00:10:02,636 --> 00:10:05,606
and I want you to take care
of your mother, okay?

166
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:08,042
I want you to know that
the world you're gonna
grow up in

167
00:10:08,075 --> 00:10:10,411
is a lot better than the one
I grew up in.

168
00:10:10,444 --> 00:10:12,880
But there will be struggles.

169
00:10:12,913 --> 00:10:15,116
So you be strong.

170
00:10:15,149 --> 00:10:17,051
You be good.

171
00:10:17,084 --> 00:10:18,587
And you take care
of your mother.

172
00:10:21,789 --> 00:10:22,857
I'm sorry, Pop.

173
00:10:25,594 --> 00:10:27,596
I mighta fucked up
real big this time.

174
00:10:38,005 --> 00:10:40,141
Hey, Ma, how's Clarice doing?

175
00:10:40,174 --> 00:10:43,277
Uh, I think she's okay.
We--we don't talk a lot.

176
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:46,380
You know, I think she's real
stressed out about her job.

177
00:10:46,413 --> 00:10:48,482
But at least she's got one,
right?

178
00:10:48,517 --> 00:10:50,918
Look, tell me about this trip
you're about to go on.

179
00:10:50,951 --> 00:10:52,453
No no, it's okay.

180
00:10:52,486 --> 00:10:54,455
It's okay.
I really just gotta go.

181
00:10:54,488 --> 00:10:56,924
There's this girl.
I don't wanna be late.

182
00:10:56,957 --> 00:10:59,760
Is everything okay?
You're acting a little jumpy.

183
00:10:59,793 --> 00:11:01,662
Everything's fine. I'm fine.

184
00:11:01,695 --> 00:11:03,097
I'm fine, really.

185
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:04,633
Um.

186
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,135
Could I borrow some money?

187
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:11,839
Oh, so that's why you're here.

188
00:11:11,872 --> 00:11:15,409
Nope. Jean-Michel,
I'm not giving you any money.

189
00:11:15,442 --> 00:11:17,178
You can just take
your little girlfriend

190
00:11:17,211 --> 00:11:18,779
and go where you wanna go.

191
00:11:18,812 --> 00:11:20,748
You know what, Ma? I'm not
doing this with you today.

192
00:11:20,781 --> 00:11:21,982
I'm a just gonna text you
when I get upstate.

193
00:11:22,016 --> 00:11:23,518
Okay, but where are you headed?

194
00:11:23,552 --> 00:11:26,487
Albany, Gloversville,
I don't know.

195
00:11:26,521 --> 00:11:28,055
Okay, I love you.

196
00:11:29,456 --> 00:11:30,592
I love you too, Ma.

197
00:11:30,625 --> 00:11:31,992
Give me a hug.

198
00:11:33,494 --> 00:11:34,461
Oh.

199
00:11:42,002 --> 00:11:44,606
Hey, you found my shirt.

200
00:11:48,409 --> 00:11:49,511
Thanks, Ma.

201
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:04,291
Jean-Michel?

202
00:12:04,325 --> 00:12:05,392
Yeah, Shavinma?

203
00:12:05,426 --> 00:12:07,529
I was just getting the mail.

204
00:12:08,929 --> 00:12:10,632
Would you like to come upstairs?

205
00:12:10,665 --> 00:12:13,033
Uh, no. No I can't,
I really gotta--

206
00:12:13,067 --> 00:12:15,604
I haven't seen you for a minute.

207
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:21,041
Just for a second.

208
00:12:23,077 --> 00:12:24,211
Just a second.

209
00:12:28,415 --> 00:12:32,419
♪ I'm good at numbers,
Haven't you heard? ♪

210
00:12:34,388 --> 00:12:37,424
- ♪ I have to control
I have lost everything ♪

211
00:12:40,861 --> 00:12:42,229
Just a moment.

212
00:12:42,263 --> 00:12:43,931
-Hello, Mrs. Coley?
-Uh-huh.

213
00:12:43,964 --> 00:12:45,866
Have you seen your son recently?

214
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:50,572
I'm Detective Roberts.
This is Officer Ryan over here.

215
00:12:50,605 --> 00:12:52,306
Shouldn't he be wearing a mask?

216
00:12:55,309 --> 00:12:57,512
No, I haven't seen him.

217
00:12:57,545 --> 00:13:00,180
And I think you need a warrant
to speak to me.

218
00:13:00,214 --> 00:13:01,448
Listen, if he happens
to come by here,

219
00:13:01,482 --> 00:13:02,751
would you please give me a call?

220
00:13:02,783 --> 00:13:04,118
We really need to...

221
00:13:04,151 --> 00:13:05,919
What's that smell?

222
00:13:05,953 --> 00:13:08,523
I'm cooking. I've got something
on the stove that's burning.

223
00:13:08,556 --> 00:13:09,857
Ms. Coley, listen, we just need
a few more minutes of your--

224
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:11,425
Fuck.

225
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:13,861
She's fuckin' lying,
she's holding something back.

226
00:13:13,894 --> 00:13:14,895
Yeah.

227
00:13:14,928 --> 00:13:16,698
He could be in there right now.

228
00:13:17,666 --> 00:13:18,700
You're right.

229
00:13:20,467 --> 00:13:21,935
What's the next move?

230
00:13:21,969 --> 00:13:23,505
Let's get something to eat.
I'll think about it.

231
00:13:26,006 --> 00:13:28,643
Hey, hold back a second.
I got an idea.

232
00:13:30,077 --> 00:13:31,879
Hey, excuse me, ladies.
My phone just died.

233
00:13:31,912 --> 00:13:34,448
I'm supposed to meet a friend
of mine here, Jean-Michel?

234
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:35,650
He's about my height,
short braids.

235
00:13:35,684 --> 00:13:36,917
Yeah, yeah, he's upstairs.

236
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:38,152
You just saw him?
What room's he in?

237
00:13:40,421 --> 00:13:41,455
He's here.

238
00:13:42,856 --> 00:13:44,058
Oh, hey, Jean-Michel.

239
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:49,731
Is this uh, is this the new
Kristof video?

240
00:13:49,764 --> 00:13:50,799
Yeah.

241
00:13:55,869 --> 00:13:57,772
<i>So what worried you so much</i>
<i>about what you saw</i>

242
00:13:57,806 --> 00:13:59,473
<i>in the government's actions</i>
<i>yesterday?</i>

243
00:13:59,507 --> 00:14:02,476
<i>Kristof, what we witnessed</i>
<i>yesterday out there</i>

244
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:04,679
<i>was an unprecedented assault</i>
<i>on our rights</i>

245
00:14:04,713 --> 00:14:06,046
<i>as peaceful protesters.</i>

246
00:14:07,448 --> 00:14:09,249
I don't wanna watch videos.

247
00:14:09,283 --> 00:14:11,185
I've been lying around
in my pajamas all day,

248
00:14:11,218 --> 00:14:15,122
and I have to get ready
and go to work.

249
00:14:15,155 --> 00:14:17,024
You still acting,
or what are you doing?

250
00:14:17,057 --> 00:14:19,828
Acting? There hasn't been
any acting work for months.

251
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:24,031
I also kinda got tired of
playing the young Black waif,

252
00:14:24,064 --> 00:14:27,468
the prostitute,
the go-go dancer,

253
00:14:27,502 --> 00:14:28,869
the sexy friend.

254
00:14:30,471 --> 00:14:33,541
Yeah, so I'm bartending now.

255
00:14:33,575 --> 00:14:35,943
Well, I thought all the bars
were closed.

256
00:14:35,976 --> 00:14:37,612
Well we have a takeout window.

257
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:40,682
What about you?
You still acting?

258
00:14:40,715 --> 00:14:43,852
Nah, nah,
it's like you said.

259
00:14:43,884 --> 00:14:48,222
Right, the whole industry
is at a standstill.

260
00:14:48,255 --> 00:14:50,357
You still out in Brooklyn?

261
00:14:50,391 --> 00:14:52,493
Yeah. Yeah, for now.

262
00:14:52,527 --> 00:14:55,730
You know, I got all this
back pay to take care of.

263
00:14:55,764 --> 00:14:58,966
Listen, would you wanna
hang out with me after work?

264
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:03,971
I think I get off at one,

265
00:15:04,004 --> 00:15:06,106
and you could come over here.

266
00:15:09,878 --> 00:15:11,412
I can't.

267
00:15:11,445 --> 00:15:13,414
I can't.

268
00:15:13,447 --> 00:15:15,617
I got, I got something else
to do later.

269
00:15:16,751 --> 00:15:18,419
Another girlfriend?

270
00:15:18,452 --> 00:15:20,387
No, no. Um.

271
00:15:22,524 --> 00:15:24,425
I'm getting outta town.

272
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:25,593
Okay.

273
00:15:25,627 --> 00:15:27,261
Finally leave the city,
you know.

274
00:15:27,294 --> 00:15:28,897
All right.

275
00:15:28,929 --> 00:15:31,866
I can't believe I never been
out the country, you know.

276
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:34,702
I gotta go.
I gotta go to like Africa,

277
00:15:34,736 --> 00:15:37,271
or like Europe
or something like that, right.

278
00:15:37,304 --> 00:15:38,673
Yeah.

279
00:15:38,706 --> 00:15:40,007
I wanna go to Paris.

280
00:15:41,942 --> 00:15:45,713
But first I gotta go to work.
I gotta get ready.

281
00:15:45,747 --> 00:15:48,015
Are you sure
you don't wanna come over later?

282
00:15:49,082 --> 00:15:50,350
Yeah.

283
00:15:50,384 --> 00:15:52,554
Yeah, no no, it's fine.

284
00:15:52,587 --> 00:15:54,556
Um, you know, speaking of...

285
00:15:54,589 --> 00:15:56,323
Shavinma, we really...

286
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,093
You know, I be...

287
00:16:03,464 --> 00:16:04,799
Think you could loan me
some cash?

288
00:16:04,833 --> 00:16:06,534
I don't have any money,
Jean-Michel. Sorry.

289
00:16:06,568 --> 00:16:08,135
Police, open up!

290
00:16:08,168 --> 00:16:10,404
- Shavinma.
<i>- Policia! </i> Let's go!

291
00:16:10,437 --> 00:16:12,406
Shavinma, get the door!

292
00:16:15,142 --> 00:16:16,977
Shavinma, get the door!

293
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:18,312
Give me a second.

294
00:16:18,345 --> 00:16:19,781
<i>Policia,</i> let's go!

295
00:16:21,281 --> 00:16:23,751
Detective Roberts with the NYPD.

296
00:16:23,785 --> 00:16:25,887
Where is Jean-Michael Coley?
We heard he's staying here.

297
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,322
-Who?
-Jean-Michel Coley.

298
00:16:28,355 --> 00:16:29,456
Um...

299
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:31,124
Who is it, Shavinma?

300
00:16:31,158 --> 00:16:32,961
It's the cops.

301
00:16:32,993 --> 00:16:34,061
Let 'em in.

302
00:16:34,094 --> 00:16:35,530
Let's go.

303
00:16:38,633 --> 00:16:41,603
-Dammit!
-Son of a bitch, fuck!

304
00:16:41,636 --> 00:16:43,470
We'll get him next time.
We'll get him next time.

305
00:16:43,505 --> 00:16:44,572
We'll get him next time!

306
00:16:44,606 --> 00:16:45,673
-Motherfucker!
-We'll get him.

307
00:16:45,707 --> 00:16:48,408
Fuck, he is gone!

308
00:16:48,442 --> 00:16:51,178
Bitch! This guy is making us
look like assholes!

309
00:16:52,145 --> 00:16:53,180
Fuck!

310
00:17:08,563 --> 00:17:10,163
Did you just take my picture?

311
00:17:10,197 --> 00:17:11,799
-What?
-Please, don't, okay.

312
00:17:11,833 --> 00:17:13,701
-No.
-Show me some respect, okay.

313
00:17:13,735 --> 00:17:15,202
No, I did, I'm sorry.

314
00:17:15,235 --> 00:17:17,371
I'm tired, and I'm not
your fucking art project.

315
00:17:17,404 --> 00:17:19,974
I, I'm an ally, and an advocate.

316
00:17:20,008 --> 00:17:23,176
I just, you had this incredible
look on your face.

317
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:25,713
It was beautiful, and I just
wanted to capture it.

318
00:17:25,747 --> 00:17:28,415
You really should ask people
before you take their picture.

319
00:17:29,684 --> 00:17:31,753
-Could I take your photo?
-No!

320
00:17:45,232 --> 00:17:47,702
I'm sorry.

321
00:17:47,735 --> 00:17:49,169
White people.

322
00:18:13,193 --> 00:18:14,762
Hey, yo, excuse me.

323
00:18:19,232 --> 00:18:20,935
-What's up?
-Where are you coming from?

324
00:18:20,969 --> 00:18:22,070
You came outta nowhere.

325
00:18:22,102 --> 00:18:23,437
I was at the bodega.

326
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:25,073
You know, they--they got
everything in there

327
00:18:25,105 --> 00:18:26,574
except for a damn toothbrush.

328
00:18:28,108 --> 00:18:29,077
Mm.

329
00:18:29,109 --> 00:18:30,845
What's up? What's up?

330
00:18:30,878 --> 00:18:33,180
Did you forget we were spending
time together today?

331
00:18:33,213 --> 00:18:34,782
Um, I tried to call you,
but your phone keeps

332
00:18:34,816 --> 00:18:36,116
going straight to voicemail.

333
00:18:36,149 --> 00:18:38,118
Oh, my phone is messed up.

334
00:18:38,151 --> 00:18:40,287
I, I had to get rid of it,
you know.

335
00:18:41,089 --> 00:18:42,422
Why?

336
00:18:42,456 --> 00:18:44,291
I could tell you
about that later.

337
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:48,128
What's up?
What you got going on?

338
00:18:50,297 --> 00:18:53,133
I'm, I'm shooting some
press photos, maybe

339
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:54,636
for this, you know, famous art,

340
00:18:54,669 --> 00:18:57,739
well, underground famous rapper.

341
00:18:57,772 --> 00:18:59,907
So I'm meeting him
and his manager tonight

342
00:18:59,941 --> 00:19:01,375
for a drink.

343
00:19:01,408 --> 00:19:04,946
Oh, okay, underground famous
rapper, who is it?

344
00:19:04,979 --> 00:19:06,146
Tyson Barrega.

345
00:19:06,179 --> 00:19:09,584
Ooh, Tyson Barrega,
the alpha omega.

346
00:19:09,617 --> 00:19:11,251
Yeah yeah yeah, I know that cat.

347
00:19:11,284 --> 00:19:13,921
I got some of his songs
on my phone, yeah.
Well I had.

348
00:19:13,955 --> 00:19:15,823
Your phone that is gone now?

349
00:19:15,857 --> 00:19:17,992
Yeah, damn I gotta download...

350
00:19:18,026 --> 00:19:20,628
That's dope, that's dope.
I'm sorry, that's dope.

351
00:19:20,662 --> 00:19:22,597
I mean, it's bittersweet
because I was trying

352
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:25,099
to spend some time
with you today.

353
00:19:25,133 --> 00:19:27,769
Well, you're just gonna
have to spend

354
00:19:27,802 --> 00:19:30,071
some time with me <i>manana.</i>

355
00:19:30,104 --> 00:19:31,973
Oh, <i>manana, manana.</i>

356
00:19:32,006 --> 00:19:35,475
I am sorry, but I don't think
I'm gonna be around <i>manana.</i>

357
00:19:36,511 --> 00:19:38,946
Oh, where you going?

358
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:41,214
I don't know.
Out west somewhere.

359
00:19:44,184 --> 00:19:45,153
Out west?

360
00:19:45,185 --> 00:19:46,654
Yeah.

361
00:19:46,688 --> 00:19:47,955
You can come with me
if you want.

362
00:19:47,989 --> 00:19:50,792
Go out west with you?

363
00:19:50,825 --> 00:19:52,459
Yeah.

364
00:19:52,492 --> 00:19:55,262
Come on, we've only been seeing
each other a couple weeks.

365
00:19:55,295 --> 00:19:58,365
Yeah yeah yeah, but what a few
weeks they've been, right?

366
00:19:58,398 --> 00:19:59,701
I mean, I been all right.

367
00:19:59,734 --> 00:20:02,335
You been, you been
fuckin' great.

368
00:20:04,505 --> 00:20:06,874
No, I'm serious, you can come
with me if you want.

369
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:10,343
Yeah yeah, I'll go away with you

370
00:20:10,377 --> 00:20:12,613
and we'll be just like
Bonnie and Clyde.

371
00:20:12,647 --> 00:20:14,615
Yeah, yeah, except
we gonna make it over

372
00:20:14,649 --> 00:20:16,084
in the car in the end, right?

373
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:18,953
Car.

374
00:20:18,986 --> 00:20:20,922
I'mma go up and change.

375
00:20:22,222 --> 00:20:25,459
Mind if I, uh,
come up and join you?

376
00:20:26,527 --> 00:20:28,495
Mmm, It's a mess up there.

377
00:20:28,529 --> 00:20:30,965
Come on, you know I don't care
nothing about all of that.

378
00:20:30,998 --> 00:20:34,135
No, no, I, for real,
it's, it's a mess.

379
00:20:36,369 --> 00:20:38,906
Mind if I accompany you
to this meeting?

380
00:20:41,709 --> 00:20:44,579
Yeah, you can accompany me
to the meeting.

381
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:46,681
I'll be right back.

382
00:20:46,714 --> 00:20:47,749
All right.

383
00:20:50,218 --> 00:20:52,553
I'm gonna see you later, right?

384
00:21:09,704 --> 00:21:13,040
Charlie, oh, what the fuck?

385
00:21:13,074 --> 00:21:17,344
I told you you could crash here
for one night! One night!

386
00:21:17,377 --> 00:21:19,680
-I appreciate that, thank you.
-I need you to get the fuck out.

387
00:21:19,714 --> 00:21:20,882
Pack up and go.

388
00:21:20,915 --> 00:21:22,449
I'm watching
the new Kristof video.

389
00:21:22,482 --> 00:21:25,285
I don't care if you're watching
the new Kristof video.

390
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:27,522
Get the fuck out!

391
00:21:27,555 --> 00:21:28,589
Okay, okay.

I told you, I...

405
00:22:44,065 --> 00:22:45,700
Don't worry
about where I got it.

406
00:22:45,733 --> 00:22:47,935
Just, just come on, get in.

407
00:22:50,504 --> 00:22:52,206
Did you steal this car?

408
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,508
I didn't--I didn't steal it,
but--but--but, we should go.

409
00:22:54,542 --> 00:22:56,644
Put your seat belt on.
We should go now.

410
00:22:58,246 --> 00:23:01,649
So, where are you meeting Tyson
Barrega and his manager?

411
00:23:01,682 --> 00:23:03,818
At the Great Lawn
in Prospect Park.

412
00:23:03,851 --> 00:23:07,788
Okay, okay,
that's a real romantic spot.

413
00:23:07,822 --> 00:23:09,891
Or practical,
for social distancing.

414
00:23:09,924 --> 00:23:12,960
Mm. Of course, of course.

415
00:23:12,994 --> 00:23:15,830
So, are you gonna tell me
whose car this is?

416
00:23:15,863 --> 00:23:17,965
It's my car.

417
00:23:17,999 --> 00:23:19,499
Okay, bullshit.

418
00:23:19,533 --> 00:23:20,568
Bullshit.

419
00:23:21,869 --> 00:23:24,338
Who is Cary Grant Carroll?
Is that you?

420
00:23:24,372 --> 00:23:26,073
Cary Grant Carroll,
that's the dude

421
00:23:26,107 --> 00:23:27,508
that I borrowed the car from.

422
00:23:27,541 --> 00:23:30,410
Right, and his address
is right there so we can

423
00:23:30,443 --> 00:23:32,046
bring it back whenever we want.

424
00:23:34,215 --> 00:23:37,218
I am just saying that
if I were to steal a car,

425
00:23:37,251 --> 00:23:39,020
I would've picked a nicer one.

426
00:23:40,721 --> 00:23:42,657
Don't forget, I'm gonna be
parked right here.

427
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:43,858
I'll see you <i>manana.</i>

428

<i>Mañana, </i> hey hey,

Oh!

438
00:24:45,319 --> 00:24:46,354
Audrey?

439
00:24:47,455 --> 00:24:49,223
Hello, good to meet you.

440
00:24:49,256 --> 00:24:51,491
-Hi.
-I'm Josh,
Tyson's manager.

441
00:24:51,525 --> 00:24:53,060
-Oh, yeah, I'm sorry.
-Do that one, yeah.

442
00:24:53,094 --> 00:24:54,328
Hi.

443
00:24:54,362 --> 00:24:56,731
Actually, I'm not
too concerned about,

444
00:24:56,764 --> 00:24:58,332
about the virus, so.

445
00:24:58,366 --> 00:25:03,070
Oh.
Thank you for meeting me here.

446
00:25:03,104 --> 00:25:06,340
Just thought, you know, this
was a good safe spot
to meet.

447
00:25:06,374 --> 00:25:09,076
Plus, you know, any chance
to be in the park.

448
00:25:11,012 --> 00:25:12,646
I love your look.

449
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:15,683
It's like you walked in off
a beach from some painting.

450
00:25:15,716 --> 00:25:17,051
Just like sauntered in.

451
00:25:18,319 --> 00:25:20,788
Thanks, I guess.

452
00:25:20,821 --> 00:25:22,423
It's just an old sundress.

453
00:25:24,392 --> 00:25:28,095
I like your shirt.
Does it say "Alien"?

454
00:25:28,129 --> 00:25:31,198
Yeah, that's what I feel like
I am, an alien.

455
00:25:31,232 --> 00:25:34,602
Like an alien trying
to break apart the system.

456
00:25:34,635 --> 00:25:39,273
Now I got, I don't know,
despite my cynical heart,

457
00:25:39,306 --> 00:25:41,942
I hope we're in the midst
of like a great awakening.

458
00:25:44,578 --> 00:25:45,846
Do you know what I'm saying?

459
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,715
Did you, uh,

460
00:25:47,748 --> 00:25:49,717
did you write that on there
with Sharpie?

461
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:52,219
Oh yeah.
Yeah, it's a handmade original,

462
00:25:52,253 --> 00:25:54,055
worth some money someday.

463
00:25:54,088 --> 00:25:56,123
Today.

464
00:25:56,157 --> 00:25:58,359
Yeah, I think when we're forced
to devote ourselves

465
00:25:58,392 --> 00:26:01,562
to scrap together a living,
it's like we're incapable

466
00:26:01,595 --> 00:26:03,898
of understanding who we are.

467
00:26:03,931 --> 00:26:07,868
But we've all been unemployed,
so we can all awaken.

468
00:26:07,902 --> 00:26:10,404
What did you do
before quarantine?

469
00:26:10,438 --> 00:26:12,006
I'm a full-time manager.

470
00:26:12,039 --> 00:26:13,707
Is that a Patek Philippe watch?

471
00:26:15,242 --> 00:26:17,211
Yeah, it's an heirloom.

472
00:26:17,244 --> 00:26:18,279
Right.

473
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,082
No, yeah, I guess, um,

474
00:26:22,416 --> 00:26:23,884
I guess we are asleep
for decades

475
00:26:23,918 --> 00:26:26,521
and then everything crashes
and we all wake up.

476
00:26:26,555 --> 00:26:29,090
Let's hope we wake up.

477
00:26:29,123 --> 00:26:31,092
I think there's a lotta people
still fucking asleep.

478
00:26:31,125 --> 00:26:33,761
It's like, wake up already,
you know.

479
00:26:33,794 --> 00:26:35,329
Did you go to the protests?

480
00:26:35,362 --> 00:26:40,668
Uh, no, I mean it still seems
kinda unsafe, right?

481
00:26:40,701 --> 00:26:42,504
I mean, I see them
on social media, though,

482
00:26:42,537 --> 00:26:44,371
and like share a lot.

483
00:26:44,405 --> 00:26:45,372
You?

484
00:26:45,406 --> 00:26:47,875
Oh yeah, of course you have.

485
00:26:47,908 --> 00:26:51,513
I've been seeing your photos.
They're amazing, like brilliant.

486
00:26:51,546 --> 00:26:53,147
Thanks. So, um...

487
00:26:54,915 --> 00:26:57,451
where is Tyson? I thought
he was meeting us here.

488
00:26:58,619 --> 00:26:59,920
Oh, no. Come on,

489
00:26:59,954 --> 00:27:01,622
we're gonna go meet him
at a party nearby.

490
00:27:01,655 --> 00:27:04,925
Don't worry, it's a rooftop
party. Lots of fresh air.

491
00:27:06,595 --> 00:27:07,628
Okay.

492
00:27:30,585 --> 00:27:32,286
-Hello?
-Yo, Gus, Gus.

493
00:27:32,319 --> 00:27:33,687
-Jean-Mich--
<i>-It's me.</i>

494
00:27:33,721 --> 00:27:35,256
-Dude.
<i>-Hey, man,</i>
<i>tell me some good news.</i>

495
00:27:35,289 --> 00:27:37,258
Tell me you found somebody
who wants to spend they money.

496
00:27:37,291 --> 00:27:39,126
Where are you?
This sounds really weird.

497
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:43,130
I'm at one of them,
the Wi-Fi kiosks, you know.

498
00:27:43,164 --> 00:27:44,999
Hey, give me a second. Boom.

499
00:27:45,032 --> 00:27:46,400
Oh yeah, talk to me.
Tell me what's going on.

500
00:27:46,433 --> 00:27:48,068
You sitting down?

501
00:27:48,102 --> 00:27:49,236
I got a deal.

502
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:51,071
I can get $200,000.

503
00:27:51,105 --> 00:27:53,107
200K? You said the shit
was worth three million, nah?

504
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:54,975
You know as well as I do,
that thing is hot.

505
00:27:55,009 --> 00:27:58,746
And this woman, she basically
is this rich heiress

506
00:27:58,779 --> 00:28:00,147
and all she really wants to do
is keep it

507
00:28:00,181 --> 00:28:01,749
in her private collection.

508
00:28:01,782 --> 00:28:04,351
She can't show it to anybody.
She kept saying that.

509
00:28:04,385 --> 00:28:06,287
I could never share it.
I can never wear it.

510
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,322
I can never share it.
I can never wear it.

511
00:28:08,355 --> 00:28:09,924
You should be happy with that.

512
00:28:09,957 --> 00:28:11,192
<i>I tried other places.</i>
<i>That's the best I can do.</i>

513
00:28:11,225 --> 00:28:13,460
All right.
Okay, okay.

514
00:28:13,494 --> 00:28:15,296
Yeah, I gotta bring up
something else.

515
00:28:15,329 --> 00:28:17,464
I want a cut.
I want 25%.

516
00:28:17,498 --> 00:28:19,099
You're fucking killing me, man.

517
00:28:19,133 --> 00:28:20,501
25%'s a good deal.

518
00:28:20,535 --> 00:28:22,036
It's probably what your agent
and your manager

519
00:28:22,069 --> 00:28:23,971
would give you if they ever
booked a job for you.

520
00:28:24,004 --> 00:28:25,706
-All right.
<i>-Otherwise you wouldn't be</i>
<i>doing what you're doing.</i>

521
00:28:25,739 --> 00:28:26,774
Fuck me, all right, all right.

522
00:28:26,807 --> 00:28:28,475
Gus, Gus, I get it, I get it.

523
00:28:28,510 --> 00:28:31,011
You a businessman, you gotta
take your cut. Fine, whatever.

524
00:28:31,045 --> 00:28:32,813
I wanna meet you tomorrow
night, seven o'clock,

525
00:28:32,846 --> 00:28:34,549
GW Bridge, southeast side.

526
00:28:34,583 --> 00:28:36,283
Little red lighthouse,
you know where that is?

527
00:28:36,317 --> 00:28:38,485
Yeah, the little red lighthouse
under the GWB.

528
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,888
Right, the jeweler's gonna
be there too,

529
00:28:40,921 --> 00:28:43,724
and he's gonna make sure
that it's all, uh, copacetic.

530
00:28:43,757 --> 00:28:45,527
Hey, Gus, I gotta go.

531
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:47,161
Jean-Michel, seriously,
stay off the news.

532
00:28:47,194 --> 00:28:49,230
I gotta go, man.
I'll talk to you later.

533
00:28:54,235 --> 00:28:55,869
Hello?

534
00:28:55,903 --> 00:28:56,971
He's on the run, man.

535
00:28:58,405 --> 00:28:59,574
I know what that's like.

536
00:29:21,795 --> 00:29:24,231
Jean-Michel, what are you doing?

537
00:29:24,265 --> 00:29:26,066
I'm tired. I wanna be alone.

538
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:28,402
Audrey, I'm sorry.

539
00:29:28,435 --> 00:29:30,204
All right, I'm sorry, I just,

540
00:29:30,237 --> 00:29:31,405
I had nowhere else
to go tonight.

541
00:29:31,438 --> 00:29:32,873
Jean-Michel,
no one is supposed to be

542
00:29:32,906 --> 00:29:34,241
sleeping here, all right.

543
00:29:34,275 --> 00:29:35,342
I'm not even supposed
to be sleeping here.

544
00:29:35,376 --> 00:29:36,578
Listen, please.

545
00:29:36,611 --> 00:29:38,680
All right, I'll be good.

546
00:29:38,713 --> 00:29:40,582
I'll sleep on the floor
if I got to.

547
00:29:42,883 --> 00:29:44,885
Fine.

548
00:29:44,918 --> 00:29:47,221
You can come up,
but we're sleeping.

549
00:29:47,254 --> 00:29:48,723
-I'm not in the mood.
-Thank you.

550
00:29:52,293 --> 00:29:54,729
So, how'd it go with Tyson?

551
00:29:54,763 --> 00:29:58,032
I didn't even meet Tyson,
just his douchebag manager.

552
00:29:58,065 --> 00:30:00,434
Douchebag, wha, he tried to hook
up with you or something?

553
00:30:00,467 --> 00:30:03,538
This manager, he was gonna take
me to a party

554
00:30:03,571 --> 00:30:05,472
where I'd meet Tyson,
but Tyson wasn't even there,

555
00:30:05,507 --> 00:30:08,242
So... yeah, I don't know,
probably.

556
00:30:24,425 --> 00:30:28,829
Mm, oh, God.

557
00:30:28,862 --> 00:30:30,565
It's times like these
that I wish I had a shower

558
00:30:30,598 --> 00:30:31,899
and not just this bucket.

559
00:30:41,776 --> 00:30:42,811
God, I...

560
00:30:44,546 --> 00:30:46,146
I really hate
this fuckin' city.

561
00:30:55,523 --> 00:30:57,958
I was just gonna say
how much I love it,

562
00:30:57,991 --> 00:30:59,960
in spite of everything.

563
00:31:01,395 --> 00:31:02,930
You know, if I could,
I'd run away to a place

564
00:31:02,963 --> 00:31:06,266
where you could see the ocean.

565
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:08,737
Somewhere you could get
your food in the street.

566
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:14,776
Somewhere you might be able
to have a little bit of peace.

567
00:31:16,243 --> 00:31:17,945
That reminds me
of this place I spent

568
00:31:17,978 --> 00:31:19,547
a couple weeks in, in Morocco.

569
00:31:19,581 --> 00:31:22,851
Yeah, I forgot you had
the chance to go to Africa.

570
00:31:22,883 --> 00:31:24,485
Yeah.

571
00:31:24,519 --> 00:31:26,554
Happiest time of my life.

572
00:31:26,588 --> 00:31:30,124
I mean, definitely stressful,
but...

573
00:31:31,925 --> 00:31:34,696
I learned more about myself
there than anywhere else.

574
00:31:34,729 --> 00:31:36,731
For real?

575
00:31:36,765 --> 00:31:39,333
Yeah, I mean,
that's where it all started.

576
00:31:39,366 --> 00:31:41,770
The birthplace, Africa.

577
00:31:43,538 --> 00:31:44,572
Yeah.

578
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:46,775
Yeah.

579
00:31:48,843 --> 00:31:51,378
I mean, it's kinda different
for you, right?

580
00:31:52,279 --> 00:31:53,480
Because you not Black.

581
00:31:54,448 --> 00:31:56,984
Yeah, I know I'm not Black.

582
00:31:57,017 --> 00:31:59,754
But it's where all humans
came from,

583
00:31:59,788 --> 00:32:01,890
-the cradle of humanity.
-Right, right.

584
00:32:01,922 --> 00:32:04,425
All, all humans.

585
00:32:05,527 --> 00:32:06,561
Uh.

586
00:32:09,531 --> 00:32:13,868
Yeah, no, I, I just hope I get
to make it back one day.

587
00:32:13,902 --> 00:32:15,335
I thought you'd never been.

588
00:32:17,705 --> 00:32:19,273
I--I haven't.

589
00:32:20,274 --> 00:32:21,543
It's complicated.

590
00:32:21,576 --> 00:32:22,610
You know,

591
00:32:24,378 --> 00:32:25,412
it's in the blood.

592
00:32:32,921 --> 00:32:33,922
So...

593
00:32:37,124 --> 00:32:38,693
You gonna kiss me?

594
00:32:43,898 --> 00:32:45,600
Yes.

595
00:32:45,633 --> 00:32:46,868
But only...

596
00:32:48,402 --> 00:32:50,037
if you promise...

597
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:55,342
next time you say please.

598
00:34:00,909 --> 00:34:02,109
Jean-Michel?

599
00:34:02,844 --> 00:34:05,045
Oh my...

600
00:34:07,015 --> 00:34:09,951
No, it's okay. It's okay, sorry.

601
00:34:11,084 --> 00:34:13,387
Sorry, I didn't... that's okay.

602
00:34:15,355 --> 00:34:17,190
I'm awake?

603
00:34:17,224 --> 00:34:20,260
I'm awake.

604
00:34:23,765 --> 00:34:24,799
I'm awake.

605
00:34:28,903 --> 00:34:29,938
It's okay.

606
00:34:32,105 --> 00:34:33,708
Here.

607
00:34:33,741 --> 00:34:35,543
Some coffee, not much but ...

608
00:34:45,053 --> 00:34:46,086
Mm.

609
00:34:48,388 --> 00:34:49,389
I am awake.

610
00:34:52,259 --> 00:34:53,360
-Mm.
-Sorry, yeah,

611
00:34:53,393 --> 00:34:55,228
that's, yeah, it's hot.

612
00:34:55,262 --> 00:34:59,567
It's okay. It's okay.

613
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:07,274
Remember when I first saw you?

614
00:35:09,409 --> 00:35:11,579
In that play last winter,
before lockdown?

615
00:35:14,414 --> 00:35:15,883
You were so mesmerizing.

616
00:35:15,917 --> 00:35:17,986
I wanted to take
your photograph so bad.

617
00:35:19,654 --> 00:35:21,455
Took a little while longer.

618
00:35:21,488 --> 00:35:22,523
But...

619
00:35:23,891 --> 00:35:27,762
Click, click, click.

620
00:35:27,795 --> 00:35:29,998
Yeah, you got what you wanted.

621
00:35:33,768 --> 00:35:35,268
What are your plans for today?

622
00:35:38,973 --> 00:35:40,440
Nothing.

623
00:35:40,474 --> 00:35:41,943
I'm...

624
00:35:41,976 --> 00:35:43,878
going to Harlem at seven.

625
00:35:43,911 --> 00:35:45,412
I gotta meet up with this guy.

626
00:35:45,445 --> 00:35:48,448
If everything goes well,
I'll be outta town tonight.

627
00:35:51,485 --> 00:35:53,353
If you want,
you could come with me.

628
00:35:55,123 --> 00:35:57,391
We could drive away together.

629
00:36:02,797 --> 00:36:07,401
So, what are you doing today?
What you got going on?

630
00:36:07,434 --> 00:36:09,737
I'm shooting Barrega at five.

631
00:36:09,771 --> 00:36:12,406
And then, um, I'm free.

632
00:36:12,439 --> 00:36:14,676
I was thinking of going
to a protest.

633
00:36:14,709 --> 00:36:17,612
I was thinking that maybe,

634
00:36:17,645 --> 00:36:19,346
maybe,

635
00:36:19,379 --> 00:36:21,749
you might wanna drive out west
with me.

636
00:36:21,783 --> 00:36:23,818
Go out west with you?

637
00:36:23,851 --> 00:36:25,385
I don't even know who you are.

638
00:36:26,954 --> 00:36:28,690
And I don't really know you,
so...

639
00:36:30,357 --> 00:36:32,927
Do you think
we romanticize outlaws?

640
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:35,963
You know, like,
because they live more free.

641
00:36:35,997 --> 00:36:37,865
Like, they're not constrained
by the rules

642
00:36:37,899 --> 00:36:39,433
the rest of society adheres to.

643
00:36:39,466 --> 00:36:40,467
What are you talking about?

644
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:43,370
You know what I'm talking about.

645
00:36:43,403 --> 00:36:45,106
I'm talking about Billy the Kid,

646
00:36:45,139 --> 00:36:47,441
I'm talking about Jesse James,
I'm talking about Scarface.

647
00:36:47,474 --> 00:36:50,978
Like...
why do we love criminals

648
00:36:51,012 --> 00:36:53,380
and killers and--and crooks?

649
00:36:53,413 --> 00:36:54,816
I don't know,
maybe people just wish

650
00:36:54,849 --> 00:36:57,885
they didn't have to care,
right?

651
00:36:57,919 --> 00:37:01,689
Maybe, maybe people
wanna be like the Terminator.

652
00:37:01,723 --> 00:37:04,324
Right,
ah, you take what you want.

653
00:37:04,357 --> 00:37:06,894
Ah, you don't care, ah!

654
00:37:08,096 --> 00:37:10,965
Living absolutely free.

655
00:37:10,998 --> 00:37:12,700
So people should be amoral?

656
00:37:12,734 --> 00:37:13,801
I ain't say that.

657
00:37:13,835 --> 00:37:15,536
Do you think that,

658
00:37:15,570 --> 00:37:18,573
do you think that
morals are--are fluid?

659
00:37:18,606 --> 00:37:19,907
What do you mean?

660
00:37:19,941 --> 00:37:22,176
Like, do you think that
our morals are set

661
00:37:22,210 --> 00:37:24,979
by when and where we were born,
by our upbringing?

662
00:37:25,012 --> 00:37:28,482
What if, in another culture,
killing someone because they

663
00:37:28,516 --> 00:37:31,986
own something that you wanted
was totally acceptable?

664
00:37:32,019 --> 00:37:34,589
Like, I mean, eagles,
they're fighting

665
00:37:34,622 --> 00:37:36,323
over scraps of meat
all the time.

666
00:37:36,356 --> 00:37:38,025
Yeah, but we not animals,
though, right?

667
00:37:38,059 --> 00:37:40,928
Okay, so which one is it?

668
00:37:40,962 --> 00:37:42,663
I don't know what
you getting at, Audrey,

669
00:37:42,697 --> 00:37:44,665
but if you talking about racism
in this country, it's wrong.

670
00:37:44,699 --> 00:37:45,666
It's always been wrong.

671
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:46,834
Of course it's always wrong.

672
00:37:46,868 --> 00:37:48,069
That's not what
I'm talking about.

673
00:37:50,605 --> 00:37:52,974
Look, listen to this.

674
00:37:53,941 --> 00:37:56,043
Okay.

675
00:37:56,077 --> 00:37:59,247
"This is why the most dangerous
creation of any society

676
00:37:59,279 --> 00:38:01,682
is that man
who has nothing to lose."

677
00:38:01,716 --> 00:38:03,350
Yeah, yeah,
that's James Baldwin, right.

678
00:38:03,383 --> 00:38:05,620
So now you quoting
James Baldwin to me.

679
00:38:05,653 --> 00:38:07,454
Just tell me what's going on,
Audrey.

680
00:38:07,487 --> 00:38:10,224
I am trying to decide
if I should

681
00:38:10,258 --> 00:38:11,759
run away with you or not,
okay?

682
00:38:11,793 --> 00:38:13,761
I can't just drop everything
and run away with you,

683
00:38:13,795 --> 00:38:15,062
even if I like you.

684
00:38:15,096 --> 00:38:17,799
Like me? You like me?

685
00:38:22,469 --> 00:38:26,007
I tell you what, Audrey,
I am so glad that you...

686
00:38:27,108 --> 00:38:29,076
like me.

687
00:38:29,110 --> 00:38:30,443
What's with the sarcasm?

688
00:38:31,746 --> 00:38:33,848
I love you, Audrey.

689
00:38:36,517 --> 00:38:39,120
I love you, and I wouldn't be
sitting here asking you

690
00:38:39,153 --> 00:38:42,190
to come with me, if I didn't.

691
00:38:46,127 --> 00:38:47,862
I love you
because you're special.

692
00:38:52,767 --> 00:38:56,604
Because you mean
something to me.

693
00:38:56,637 --> 00:38:57,939
I mean, shoot,
you're like the first white girl

694
00:38:57,972 --> 00:38:59,339
I ever fell in love with.

695
00:38:59,372 --> 00:39:01,843
Huh, I mean,
if anybody found out about this

696
00:39:01,876 --> 00:39:02,977
back home,
they wouldn't believe it.

697
00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:05,746
I'm gonna throw up.

698
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:07,248
-White girl?
-No, that's what I--

699
00:39:07,281 --> 00:39:09,283
-White girl?
-I didn't even mean it
like that.

700
00:39:09,317 --> 00:39:10,952
Just a white girl,
just a white girl.

701
00:39:10,985 --> 00:39:14,655
That's not what I meant.

702
00:39:14,689 --> 00:39:16,190
I mean, one day, I really wish

703
00:39:16,224 --> 00:39:19,193
we could just like,
see beyond race.

704
00:39:19,227 --> 00:39:21,863
This country
is built on race, Audrey.

705
00:39:21,896 --> 00:39:23,865
You can't see past it.

706
00:39:23,898 --> 00:39:24,866
It comes through the pores.

707
00:39:24,899 --> 00:39:26,601
Well, maybe I'm an optimist.

708
00:39:26,634 --> 00:39:28,102
God, you know,
when I was 12 years old,

709
00:39:28,135 --> 00:39:30,705
my father told me
I couldn't marry a Black man?

710
00:39:30,738 --> 00:39:32,773
When I was about the same age,
my mom said,

711
00:39:32,807 --> 00:39:35,576
don't end up
with no white girl,
she'll ruin your life.

712
00:39:36,376 --> 00:39:37,410
Man.

713
00:39:40,581 --> 00:39:41,682
But they're still our parents.

714
00:39:41,716 --> 00:39:42,750
Yeah.

715
00:39:44,218 --> 00:39:45,253
And we...

716
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:49,357
still got them, right?

717
00:39:51,592 --> 00:39:54,461
You got what you got.
I got what I got.

718
00:39:54,494 --> 00:39:57,365
Everybody out there, they got
whatever they working with.

719
00:39:59,367 --> 00:40:02,203
You know, we all got
what we got, and we just

720
00:40:02,236 --> 00:40:04,639
trying to do the best
we can with it, that's it.

721
00:40:08,676 --> 00:40:11,411
I just hate that the only thing

722
00:40:11,444 --> 00:40:13,381
people see is my whiteness.

723
00:40:15,850 --> 00:40:17,618
It's not the only thing I see.

724
00:40:21,188 --> 00:40:22,223
I'm serious.

725
00:40:25,026 --> 00:40:26,060
Hey, I...

726
00:40:28,129 --> 00:40:29,597
I see all of you.

727
00:40:42,743 --> 00:40:47,214
If I think about it, I think
I seen about every inch of you.

728
00:40:50,450 --> 00:40:51,819
It's rude to point.

729
00:40:53,921 --> 00:40:55,823
Come on,
I wanna take a picture of us.

730
00:41:07,467 --> 00:41:09,804
You got this.
I have to see how it works.

731
00:41:09,837 --> 00:41:13,975
♪ I know I can do it alone ♪

732
00:41:15,443 --> 00:41:17,878
-♪ All on my own ♪
-Oh, okay.

733
00:41:20,781 --> 00:41:22,683
I'm gonna look off again
for this one.

734
00:41:23,751 --> 00:41:26,486
And you can look into camera.

735
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:28,089
-Okay?
-You're gonna look away?

736
00:41:28,122 --> 00:41:29,724
-Yeah.
-Scared of me or something?

737
00:41:29,757 --> 00:41:30,992
No!

738
00:41:33,094 --> 00:41:36,430
Wow, these are
really fuckin' good.

739
00:41:36,464 --> 00:41:37,999
You're brilliant. You're like
a genius or something.

740
00:41:38,032 --> 00:41:39,734
I'm not a genius.

741
00:41:42,136 --> 00:41:43,738
This morning, while
you were still sleeping,

742
00:41:43,771 --> 00:41:47,141
I took a look at the news,
and the new Kristof video.

743
00:41:47,174 --> 00:41:48,376
Yeah, what'd you see?

744
00:41:50,444 --> 00:41:52,847
You're the cover
of all the papers.

745
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:55,416
Kristof dedicated his entire
episode to you.

746
00:41:55,449 --> 00:41:56,951
Fuck, really?

747
00:41:56,984 --> 00:41:59,820
No, they are vilifying you,
saying you're the face

748
00:41:59,854 --> 00:42:01,789
of everything wrong
with the movement.

749
00:42:01,822 --> 00:42:03,657
Fuck, are you serious?

750
00:42:03,691 --> 00:42:05,793
That's not true. That's not it.

751
00:42:05,826 --> 00:42:06,994
Are you being for real with me?

752
00:42:07,028 --> 00:42:08,062
Look.

753
00:42:10,364 --> 00:42:13,601
Fuck it,
is that my fuckin' headshot.

754
00:42:13,634 --> 00:42:16,370
White cop killed by Black man
ignites debate and fury.

755
00:42:16,404 --> 00:42:19,040
What you...
Get the fuck...

756
00:42:19,073 --> 00:42:20,441
He died?

757
00:42:20,474 --> 00:42:22,676
Yo, he fuckin'... he died?

758
00:42:25,913 --> 00:42:27,548
I wanna see the Kristof video.

759
00:42:29,650 --> 00:42:31,685
Good morning, everyone.
Sorry about the eye.

760
00:42:31,719 --> 00:42:35,022
I did not sleep well. It's been
kind of a rough night.

761
00:42:35,056 --> 00:42:36,991
Today, I had something
completely different planned,

762
00:42:37,024 --> 00:42:39,693
you know,
just check the calendar.

763
00:42:39,727 --> 00:42:41,996
You know what, don't look
at that calendar too closely,

764
00:42:42,029 --> 00:42:44,965
because you know, then where
would the surprises be?

765
00:42:44,999 --> 00:42:47,568
What I'm trying to say is I had
a completely different show

766
00:42:47,601 --> 00:42:50,371
planned for today, but then,
you know, whack,

767
00:42:50,404 --> 00:42:52,907
slapped in the face
with a new catastrophe.

768
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:54,742
But right, isn't that
this whole year, right?

769
00:42:54,775 --> 00:42:57,078
You plan one thing and then,
new catastrophe.

770
00:42:57,111 --> 00:42:59,213
New catastrophe.

771
00:42:59,246 --> 00:43:02,216
And what is today's new
catastrophe, you're asking?

772
00:43:03,451 --> 00:43:06,187
You guessed it.
Jean-Michel Coley.

773
00:43:06,220 --> 00:43:09,390
But you know what?
We're not on lockdown anymore.

774
00:43:09,423 --> 00:43:11,492
And I don't wanna just talk
to you about this myself,

775
00:43:11,526 --> 00:43:13,528
so let's go, come on.

776
00:43:26,273 --> 00:43:29,544
I'm here with Rebecca Harvey
and John Stanfield,

777
00:43:29,578 --> 00:43:31,513
two organizers
of the Black Lives Matter

778
00:43:31,546 --> 00:43:33,080
movement here in Brooklyn.

779
00:43:33,114 --> 00:43:35,349
I imagine you guys
saw the video,

780
00:43:35,382 --> 00:43:38,520
and just wanted to get your
thoughts on Jean-Michel Coley.

781
00:43:38,553 --> 00:43:41,523
Just an hour ago,
the president, you know,
stated that this killing

782
00:43:41,556 --> 00:43:44,559
should completely discredit
the entire movement.

783
00:43:44,593 --> 00:43:48,229
Look, I have no love
for the president,

784
00:43:48,262 --> 00:43:50,264
but I do not condone violence
either.

785
00:43:50,297 --> 00:43:52,733
Mr. Coley should not have shot
this cop,

786
00:43:52,766 --> 00:43:55,369
and I worry that,

787
00:43:55,402 --> 00:43:58,272
I worry that this will set
the entire movement back.

788
00:43:58,305 --> 00:44:02,376
Kristof, yes, Mr. Coley
should not have shot the cop,

789
00:44:02,409 --> 00:44:05,079
but as you could see
in the video, there is no sound.

790
00:44:05,112 --> 00:44:07,148
And we don't know
if he was threatened or not.

791
00:44:07,181 --> 00:44:10,619
Now let me tell you something,
as a Black man,

792
00:44:10,651 --> 00:44:13,487
we are taught to be submissive
to the police

793
00:44:13,522 --> 00:44:15,789
so we won't wind up dead.

794
00:44:15,823 --> 00:44:17,825
Even if we are submissive
to the police,

795
00:44:17,858 --> 00:44:19,927
we still wind up dead.

796
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:22,663
I don't know, maybe Mr. Coley
got tired of it or whatever.

797
00:44:22,696 --> 00:44:26,000
So do you think Jean-Michel
Coley should turn himself in?

798
00:44:26,033 --> 00:44:27,569
-Yes.
-Yes.

799
00:44:27,602 --> 00:44:29,436
Fuck this, fuck this.
What did the president...

800
00:44:29,470 --> 00:44:31,138
No, no, I don't wanna know
what he said.

801
00:44:31,172 --> 00:44:32,507
I don't care what he said.

802
00:44:32,541 --> 00:44:33,807
I don't fuckin' give a shit
what he said.

803
00:44:33,841 --> 00:44:35,309
-What did he say?
-He, he said

804
00:44:35,342 --> 00:44:37,811
that this proves that
he was right and that

805
00:44:37,845 --> 00:44:41,248
the movement is dangerous
and full of bad people,

806
00:44:41,282 --> 00:44:45,019
and that, you killing the cop
is an attack on America

807
00:44:45,052 --> 00:44:47,656
and now,
you're an enemy of the state.

808
00:44:47,688 --> 00:44:50,991
Yo, fuck him, fuck his hair,
fuck his little fuckin' ties,

809
00:44:51,025 --> 00:44:53,160
fuck the KKK members
he's related to.

810
00:44:53,194 --> 00:44:54,228
Why'd you do it?

811
00:44:57,164 --> 00:44:58,732
I just wanna try to understand.

812
00:45:08,677 --> 00:45:10,945
This young white dude
left a briefcase

813
00:45:10,978 --> 00:45:12,479
right in front of me
while I was working.

814
00:45:12,514 --> 00:45:13,714
You know he was wearing a suit,

815
00:45:13,747 --> 00:45:15,849
a fuckin' ascot,
some shit like that.

816
00:45:15,883 --> 00:45:17,519
I figure it's an opportunity.

817
00:45:17,552 --> 00:45:19,220
I take the briefcase,
I run down the alleyway,

818
00:45:19,253 --> 00:45:21,889
I look inside the briefcase,
fuckin' necklace inside.

819
00:45:21,922 --> 00:45:23,257
It's a necklace
with a ruby on it.

820
00:45:23,290 --> 00:45:24,659
I don't know how much
the ruby is worth,

821
00:45:24,693 --> 00:45:25,993
I don't know how much
the necklace is worth,

822
00:45:26,026 --> 00:45:27,629
but I know it's a lot
because it's a gun

823
00:45:27,662 --> 00:45:29,296
right next to the motherfucker.

824
00:45:31,432 --> 00:45:33,734
Then a cop comes
around the corner.

825
00:45:33,767 --> 00:45:35,903
But first I get to throw
the gun in the trash, right,

826
00:45:35,936 --> 00:45:38,640
because you gotta be smart,
you gotta be fuckin' smart.

827
00:45:38,673 --> 00:45:40,374
And the cop runs up behind me,
he's like, yo,

828
00:45:40,407 --> 00:45:42,977
put your hands up on the wall,
put your hands

829
00:45:43,010 --> 00:45:46,480
against the fuckin' wall
or I'll fuckin' blow you away.

830
00:45:49,551 --> 00:45:51,720
He's fuckin' patting me down,

831
00:45:51,752 --> 00:45:56,023
got his hands up
in my fuckin' junk and shit.

832
00:45:56,056 --> 00:45:57,891
Then he reaches inside
my pocket, he pulls
the necklace out.

833
00:45:57,925 --> 00:46:01,161
He's like, oh yeah, yeah yeah,
this is too good for you.

834
00:46:01,195 --> 00:46:02,763
I'mma give this to my wife.

835
00:46:04,198 --> 00:46:06,534
A fucking crooked ass cop,
talking about

836
00:46:06,568 --> 00:46:08,469
"I'm gonna light you up."

837
00:46:10,639 --> 00:46:11,972
Yo, Audrey, I made a move.

838
00:46:14,074 --> 00:46:17,646
I made a move because he...
made a move.

839
00:46:25,286 --> 00:46:27,321
Fuck, man, I don't know.

840
00:46:35,262 --> 00:46:37,197
You have this necklace
on you right now?

841
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:40,334
Yeah.

842
00:46:53,013 --> 00:46:54,048
Is this real?

843
00:46:56,785 --> 00:46:58,620
It almost looks fake.

844
00:46:58,653 --> 00:46:59,688
Oh, it's real.

845
00:47:01,855 --> 00:47:03,991
It's real.

846
00:47:04,024 --> 00:47:06,561
I think it's called
the--The Evening Sun.

847
00:47:07,828 --> 00:47:10,898
It was at a jewelry store,
Christie's,

848
00:47:10,931 --> 00:47:12,933
over by Fifth Avenue.

849
00:47:12,966 --> 00:47:17,739
They took it during the looting
after the protests.

850
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:21,141
It's worth like three mil.

851
00:47:21,175 --> 00:47:22,744
Uh.

852
00:47:22,777 --> 00:47:23,812
Yeah.

853
00:47:26,180 --> 00:47:30,484
Nobody wanna touch it, though.
It's a museum piece, so.

854
00:47:30,518 --> 00:47:32,620
Look, I know a guy
who knows this heiress,

855
00:47:32,654 --> 00:47:35,155
and she's gonna buy it
for like 200K.

856
00:47:35,189 --> 00:47:36,825
I'mma take the deal,

857
00:47:36,857 --> 00:47:39,426
and he gonna take $50,000
as a commission.

858
00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:42,930
I get to walk away
with 150 large.

859
00:47:44,799 --> 00:47:47,702
It's enough to start...
something.

860
00:47:47,736 --> 00:47:49,203
It's enough to start a life.

861
00:47:52,306 --> 00:47:54,141
I don't wanna have to
do this alone.

862
00:47:54,174 --> 00:47:55,909
I can, if I got to, but

863
00:47:57,645 --> 00:48:00,447
yo, I really want you
to come with me.

864
00:48:03,217 --> 00:48:04,918
I don't want you to do it alone.

865
00:48:08,690 --> 00:48:10,190
But I don't know, I'm scared.

866
00:48:11,925 --> 00:48:13,561
Right, right, nah, you're right,

867
00:48:13,595 --> 00:48:15,864
because this is fucking crazy.

868
00:48:15,896 --> 00:48:17,164
Right, this is fucking crazy,

869
00:48:17,197 --> 00:48:18,666
because I killed
this fucking cop,

870
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:20,200
even though he was probably,

871
00:48:20,234 --> 00:48:22,336
he was probably gonna shoot me,
but fuck it, right?

872
00:48:22,369 --> 00:48:25,172
This is fuckin' nuts.

873
00:48:25,205 --> 00:48:26,741
I just, just, just couldn't end
up in jail.

874
00:48:26,775 --> 00:48:27,809
I couldn't do this.

875
00:48:29,176 --> 00:48:31,412
Listen, all right, just...

876
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:36,917
Look, we don't have to go away
forever, right?

877
00:48:38,553 --> 00:48:40,622
It's not till the end of time.
I just...

878
00:48:43,056 --> 00:48:44,726
I just need
a little bit of time.

879
00:48:46,126 --> 00:48:47,829
Then we can figure out
how to make ends meet.

880
00:48:47,862 --> 00:48:50,832
We could, I don't know,
find a job

881
00:48:50,865 --> 00:48:52,266
or open up a shop or something.

882
00:48:55,770 --> 00:48:57,839
What about acting?

883
00:48:59,774 --> 00:49:01,543
Acting?

884
00:49:01,576 --> 00:49:04,445
Shit, Audrey,
I could do my thing anytime,

885
00:49:04,478 --> 00:49:08,449
anywhere, no matter what,
as long as I got you.

886
00:49:08,482 --> 00:49:11,719
You know, I could,
I could write books in exile,

887
00:49:11,753 --> 00:49:14,955
like, like Dostoevsky.

888
00:49:14,988 --> 00:49:17,559
Do you really think
we can get away with this?

889
00:49:17,592 --> 00:49:20,929
Yeah, I mean,
with the right amount of money

890
00:49:20,961 --> 00:49:22,864
in this world,
you could do anything.

891
00:49:22,897 --> 00:49:25,432
Do you trust this guy
that's selling it for you?

892
00:49:26,233 --> 00:49:27,267
Enough.

893
00:49:27,301 --> 00:49:29,069
Where are you meeting him?

894
00:49:29,102 --> 00:49:31,673
It's this little red lighthouse
under the GWB.

895
00:49:35,075 --> 00:49:36,109
Okay.

896
00:49:37,978 --> 00:49:40,748
You get the money
and I'll finish my shoot

897
00:49:40,782 --> 00:49:44,117
and I'll meet you
and we'll go away together.

898
00:49:44,151 --> 00:49:45,620
For real?

899
00:49:45,653 --> 00:49:47,387
I don't know, maybe.

900
00:49:47,421 --> 00:49:48,790
I mean,
New York's at a standstill.

901
00:49:48,823 --> 00:49:50,123
There's no work.

902
00:49:50,157 --> 00:49:52,226
I owe back rent on this studio.

903
00:49:53,695 --> 00:49:54,729
Maybe.

904
00:49:57,097 --> 00:49:58,131
Hey.

905
00:50:00,133 --> 00:50:01,235
Maybe's fine.

906
00:50:03,805 --> 00:50:05,072
I'll take what I can get.

907
00:50:36,704 --> 00:50:39,674
What you doing?

908
00:50:41,509 --> 00:50:44,612
<i>A bad Marcel Marceau</i>
<i>impersonation.</i>

909
00:50:46,046 --> 00:50:47,916
I don't think it's so bad.

910
00:50:49,884 --> 00:50:51,519
What time are you meeting Tyson
and his manager?

911
00:50:51,553 --> 00:50:53,521
I think at five.

912
00:50:53,555 --> 00:50:54,956
You gotta get going, right?

913
00:50:54,989 --> 00:50:56,223
Yeah, probably.

914
00:50:58,091 --> 00:50:59,827
Don't you have to get going too?

915
00:50:59,861 --> 00:51:03,031
Yeah, yeah, I gotta,
I gotta brush my teeth.

916
00:51:05,767 --> 00:51:08,335
Hey, hey, you can't go out
there like that.

917
00:51:08,368 --> 00:51:09,837
What you mean?

918
00:51:09,871 --> 00:51:12,040
I mean, I'm not even supposed
to be living here.

919
00:51:12,072 --> 00:51:13,273
Put on a shirt.

920
00:51:14,408 --> 00:51:16,143
And, hello? A mask.

921
00:51:17,377 --> 00:51:19,047
You right, you right, you right.

922
00:52:02,991 --> 00:52:04,759
Make sure you follow my lead,
okay?

923
00:52:04,792 --> 00:52:07,028
-Yeah, you got it.
-♪ I'm good with numbers, ♪

924
00:52:07,061 --> 00:52:09,631
♪ haven't you heard? ♪

925
00:52:11,099 --> 00:52:15,202
♪ I have to control
I have lost everything ♪

926
00:52:34,756 --> 00:52:38,559
That was quick. Sorry,
I thought I kept it unlocked.

927
00:52:40,962 --> 00:52:42,897
I thought you were the girl
that paints down the hall.

928
00:52:42,930 --> 00:52:44,632
Can I help you?

929
00:52:44,666 --> 00:52:46,466
I'm Detective Roberts.
This is Officer Ryan.

930
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:47,467
You Audrey Lasko?

931
00:52:47,501 --> 00:52:48,536
Yes, I am.

932
00:52:50,004 --> 00:52:51,839
Believe you had a relationship
with this guy?

933
00:52:51,873 --> 00:52:53,407
Or that he's here right now?

934
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:55,275
Excuse me, you can't fucking
barge in here like that!

935
00:52:55,308 --> 00:52:58,245
And wear goddamn masks.

936
00:52:58,278 --> 00:53:02,449
Yes, Jean-Michel and I had
a fling a few weeks ago.

937
00:53:02,482 --> 00:53:04,819
I've seen his face
all over the news.

938
00:53:04,852 --> 00:53:06,087
He killed a cop, right?

939
00:53:06,988 --> 00:53:08,089
-Yeah.
-Look,

940
00:53:08,122 --> 00:53:09,423
I don't know what to tell you.

941
00:53:09,456 --> 00:53:11,224
I haven't seen or heard
from him in weeks.

942
00:53:11,258 --> 00:53:12,827
I have a photo shoot I have
to get ready for in an hour,

943
00:53:12,860 --> 00:53:15,963
so unless you two
have a warrant,

944
00:53:15,997 --> 00:53:17,632
I'm gonna kindly ask you
to leave.

945
00:53:17,665 --> 00:53:19,466
This chick must watch
a lotta procedurals.

946
00:53:19,499 --> 00:53:20,802
Don't call me a chick.

947
00:53:20,835 --> 00:53:22,469
Are you supposed
to be living here?

948
00:53:22,502 --> 00:53:24,371
I don't think you're allowed
to be living in these stu...

949
00:53:26,808 --> 00:53:29,209
I think we're gonna find out
pretty quickly

950
00:53:29,242 --> 00:53:31,846
if Miss Lasko's lying or not.

951
00:53:31,879 --> 00:53:35,550
All we have to do
is go to your super

952
00:53:35,583 --> 00:53:37,317
and get access to those tapes.

953
00:53:37,350 --> 00:53:39,821
Do you have the super's number,
ma'am?

954
00:53:39,854 --> 00:53:41,823
Sorry, I don't.

955
00:53:41,856 --> 00:53:44,826
Audrey, you do know that
withholding evidence
is a felony?

956
00:53:44,859 --> 00:53:46,027
You can go to jail for it.

957
00:53:46,060 --> 00:53:48,696
Pretty girl like you, upstate.

958
00:53:50,430 --> 00:53:52,066
They'll mess you up.

959
00:53:52,100 --> 00:53:53,868
We'll be in touch.

960
00:53:53,901 --> 00:53:54,936
Let's go.

961
00:54:26,901 --> 00:54:28,236
This is Detective Roberts
of the NYPD.

962
00:54:28,268 --> 00:54:29,570
How you doing today?

963
00:54:29,604 --> 00:54:32,907
Listen, I'm gonna need some...

964
00:54:32,940 --> 00:54:35,777
I'm gonna need some footage
from you, from the building.

965
00:54:35,810 --> 00:54:37,845
We got reason to believe
that um...

966
00:56:26,386 --> 00:56:28,222
"What happens
to a dream deferred?

967
00:56:30,658 --> 00:56:32,560
Does it

968
00:56:32,593 --> 00:56:34,896
dry up
like a raisin in the sun?

969
00:56:34,929 --> 00:56:38,232
Does it fester like a sore?

970
00:56:39,533 --> 00:56:40,568
And run?

971
00:56:42,937 --> 00:56:45,940
Does it smell like rotten meat,
or does it

972
00:56:47,742 --> 00:56:52,813
crust, sugar over,
like a syrupy sweet?"

973
00:56:55,415 --> 00:56:57,151
Sweet, sweet.

974
00:56:59,353 --> 00:57:00,388
"Does it,

975
00:57:02,723 --> 00:57:05,059
does it sag like a heavy load?

976
00:57:08,296 --> 00:57:11,098
Or...

977
00:57:14,402 --> 00:57:16,270
does it explode?"

978
00:57:18,539 --> 00:57:22,076
Jean-Michel, what the hell
are you doing here?

979
00:57:23,644 --> 00:57:25,046
The whole city
is looking for you.

980
00:57:25,079 --> 00:57:28,382
Hey, Blake. I figured
you'd be here, man.

981
00:57:28,416 --> 00:57:31,285
I just wanted to come by,
see you.

982
00:57:31,319 --> 00:57:34,622
See this space before I...
before I got out the city.

983
00:57:38,426 --> 00:57:41,461
Well you, you not gonna call
the cops on me, right?

984
00:57:41,494 --> 00:57:44,699
No, I'm not gonna call
the cops on you,

985
00:57:44,732 --> 00:57:48,869
but you know, seeing your face
across the TV,

986
00:57:48,903 --> 00:57:51,605
you know it's got me fucked up,
right?

987
00:57:51,639 --> 00:57:53,274
I mean, I can't believe it.

988
00:57:53,307 --> 00:57:55,443
Sounds like you shot that cop
in cold blood.

989
00:57:55,475 --> 00:57:56,811
Blake, it wasn't like that.

990
00:57:56,844 --> 00:58:00,081
All right, I was scared.
I didn't wanna die.

991
00:58:00,114 --> 00:58:01,615
I don't wanna go to jail.

992
00:58:01,649 --> 00:58:05,720
We all get scared, but we have
to fight that fear.

993
00:58:05,753 --> 00:58:08,122
If you're scared,
then you're foolish.

994
00:58:08,155 --> 00:58:09,890
And if you're foolish,
then you're a goner.

995
00:58:09,924 --> 00:58:13,227
Yeah, yeah, naw, I know. I know.

996
00:58:13,260 --> 00:58:14,662
Your mother must be torn up.

997
00:58:14,695 --> 00:58:16,630
Have you seen her?
Have you thought about her?

998
00:58:16,664 --> 00:58:19,333
Yeah, yeah, I saw her
a little while ago,

999
00:58:19,367 --> 00:58:22,103
but that was before
all the news hit.

1000
00:58:22,136 --> 00:58:23,738
Yo, if you trying to make me
feel bad,

1001
00:58:23,771 --> 00:58:26,140
I already feel as bad as I can,
so...

1002
00:58:28,109 --> 00:58:29,810
Jean, I'm not trying to get you
to do anything.

1003
00:58:29,844 --> 00:58:31,045
Blake...

1004
00:58:32,013 --> 00:58:34,682
I just wanted to say hi.

1005
00:58:35,616 --> 00:58:37,318
And--And tell you that,

1006
00:58:39,820 --> 00:58:41,689
you know,
this theater saved my life.

1007
00:58:43,190 --> 00:58:46,427
Look, I know things are heated
right now.

1008
00:58:46,460 --> 00:58:48,429
I don't like the cops myself.

1009
00:58:48,462 --> 00:58:52,333
I nearly got beaten up
at a protest about a week ago.

1010
00:58:52,366 --> 00:58:54,702
But you're putting out fire
with gasoline.

1011
00:58:54,735 --> 00:58:57,338
I want to defend you,
but what you did was wrong.

1012
00:58:57,371 --> 00:59:00,274
You fucked up,
and you're talented too.

1013
00:59:00,307 --> 00:59:02,043
And you fucked that up as well,
too.

1014
00:59:03,744 --> 00:59:05,980
You need to
do the right thing
and turn yourself in.

1015
00:59:06,013 --> 00:59:08,449
It'll help all of us.
It'll help the movement.

1016
00:59:08,482 --> 00:59:12,353
Nah, yo, I can't do that.
I can't go to jail, I...

1017
00:59:12,386 --> 00:59:13,421
Shit, would you?

1018
00:59:15,589 --> 00:59:18,359
Then you need to get
as far away as you can
from here.

1019
00:59:19,360 --> 00:59:20,327
To another country.

1020
00:59:21,362 --> 00:59:22,563
Blake?

1021
00:59:22,596 --> 00:59:23,898
You need to go.
Leave through the rear,

1022
00:59:23,931 --> 00:59:25,733
I'll stall her.

1023
00:59:25,766 --> 00:59:27,468
I'm here. I'm already here.

1024
00:59:27,501 --> 00:59:28,702
Were you talking to somebody?

1025
00:59:28,736 --> 00:59:31,138
No no no, I was working
on a monologue.

1026
00:59:31,172 --> 00:59:33,441
You know, I used to be
a great actor myself.

1027
00:59:34,275 --> 00:59:35,643
I still am.

1028
00:59:35,676 --> 00:59:37,211
Like, she forced me
to turn my camera off

1029
00:59:37,244 --> 00:59:38,479
while I was having
a massive freakout.

1030
00:59:38,513 --> 00:59:40,581
-Ah.
-Oh, she called you out.

1031
00:59:42,383 --> 00:59:44,185
She called you all the way out.

1032
00:59:44,218 --> 00:59:47,755
- Don't do that to me.
Don't be doin' that to me.

1033
00:59:49,590 --> 00:59:52,860
Oh my gosh, yo,
it's Jean-Michael Coley.

1034
00:59:52,893 --> 00:59:54,862
Ooh.

1035
00:59:54,895 --> 00:59:56,864
Oh, it's the Jean-Michael Coley.

1036
00:59:56,897 --> 00:59:58,399
You're my fuckin' hero.
You are my hero.

1037
00:59:58,432 --> 01:00:00,067
Don't say that.
Just chill, Just y'all--

1038
01:00:00,101 --> 01:00:02,503
The way you shot, bow!

1039
01:00:02,537 --> 01:00:05,239
Just keep it down.
Keep it down, all right.

1040
01:00:05,272 --> 01:00:07,675
Let's take a picture.
Come on, come on.

1041
01:00:07,708 --> 01:00:09,743
One picture. One picture.

1042
01:00:09,777 --> 01:00:11,846
-Just one?
-Nah, nah, I'm good.

1043
01:00:11,879 --> 01:00:13,114
Take multiple.

1044
01:00:13,147 --> 01:00:14,516
Just make sure y'all wait
to post this

1045
01:00:14,549 --> 01:00:15,883
like three to five business
days, please.

1046
01:00:15,916 --> 01:00:16,951
Okay.

1047
01:00:19,787 --> 01:00:22,056
Oh my God, so good.
I got 'em, I got 'em.

1048
01:00:22,089 --> 01:00:23,090
All right.

1049
01:00:23,124 --> 01:00:25,594
Hey, y'all listen, all right.

1050
01:00:26,627 --> 01:00:28,295
Don't go out and do what I did.

1051
01:00:28,329 --> 01:00:30,030
What?

1052
01:00:30,064 --> 01:00:31,966
It was wrong. It was wrong.

1053
01:00:31,999 --> 01:00:33,400
Fuck the police, man. Fuck them.

1054
01:00:33,434 --> 01:00:36,605
And, and, and they wrong too.
They wrong too.

1055
01:00:36,637 --> 01:00:38,105
But what I did was wrong too.

1056
01:00:38,139 --> 01:00:40,741
All right, don't kill no cops.
Don't kill nobody.

1057
01:00:40,774 --> 01:00:42,409
-Fuck that.
-That's some bullshit.

1058
01:00:42,443 --> 01:00:43,911
Aren't they people too?

1059
01:00:43,944 --> 01:00:45,913
Right.

1060
01:00:45,946 --> 01:00:47,148
Yo, white lives matter.

1061
01:00:48,749 --> 01:00:50,619
Life is about living.

1062
01:00:50,651 --> 01:00:53,053
The world don't need that shit
right now, all right.

1063
01:00:53,087 --> 01:00:55,322
Y'all stay up. Y'all stay safe.

1064
01:00:55,356 --> 01:00:56,625
Where you going?

1065
01:00:56,657 --> 01:00:57,958
Wait, wait.

1066
01:00:57,992 --> 01:00:59,293
Wait to post them pictures,
all right.

1067
01:00:59,326 --> 01:01:01,061
No, bro, whoa.

1068
01:01:01,095 --> 01:01:02,163
Until when?

1069
01:01:06,133 --> 01:01:07,134
-Show me the pictures.
-Where are you going?

1070
01:01:07,168 --> 01:01:08,169
Wait, let me see.

1071
01:01:14,441 --> 01:01:16,010
Hi.

1072
01:01:16,043 --> 01:01:20,314
Hey, and so we meet again.
You look lovely once again.

1073
01:01:20,347 --> 01:01:21,482
Thanks.

1074
01:01:21,516 --> 01:01:22,683
I'm so sorry about
the other night,

1075
01:01:22,716 --> 01:01:24,151
but, uh, my man is here today.

1076
01:01:24,185 --> 01:01:26,687
Tyson, this is Audrey,
the photographer.

1077
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:28,455
-Hi.
-Hi, Audrey, I'm Tyson Barrega.

1078
01:01:28,489 --> 01:01:29,957
Nice to meet you.

1079
01:01:29,990 --> 01:01:31,292
Yeah, we'll do the elbow.
We can do the double.

1080
01:01:31,325 --> 01:01:32,793
Yeah, I don't know why.
I like the double.

1081
01:01:32,826 --> 01:01:34,529
Sorry I didn't make it
to your event last night.

1082
01:01:34,563 --> 01:01:36,030
I was actually at another event.

1083
01:01:36,063 --> 01:01:38,165
Got a little high,
toking it up,

1084
01:01:38,199 --> 01:01:39,967
lost track of time.

1085
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:43,137
But you know. So what do you
have in mind for the shoot?

1086
01:01:43,170 --> 01:01:46,974
I was thinking maybe we would
start on this playground.

1087
01:01:47,007 --> 01:01:49,710
You know, just like,
a kid in the neighborhood,

1088
01:01:49,743 --> 01:01:51,979
super casual, nothing crazy.

1089
01:01:52,012 --> 01:01:53,447
All right, I'm feeling that.

1090
01:01:53,480 --> 01:01:54,982
Does that feel good?

1091
01:01:55,015 --> 01:01:59,186
Yeah, but do you think
we'll be needing Josh here?

1092
01:01:59,220 --> 01:02:00,689
No, I think we're good.

1093
01:02:00,721 --> 01:02:01,789
Yeah, I mean...

1094
01:02:01,822 --> 01:02:04,058
Well,
all right then my dude

1095
01:02:06,360 --> 01:02:08,663
I love this with the crown
and the lion earring.

1096
01:02:08,697 --> 01:02:11,465
-Like a wild thing.
-Yes, yes!

1097
01:02:11,498 --> 01:02:13,033
- All right, let's do this.
- Very cute.

1098
01:02:14,569 --> 01:02:16,070
Ooh, yeah, I love the arms up.

1099
01:02:16,103 --> 01:02:17,071
Mm-hm.

1100
01:02:18,405 --> 01:02:20,374
Gorgeous.
So you grew up in the Bronx?

1101
01:02:20,407 --> 01:02:21,909
I did, born and raised.

1102
01:02:21,942 --> 01:02:23,477
How's your summer been?

1103
01:02:23,511 --> 01:02:25,145
Better than expected, actually.

1104
01:02:25,179 --> 01:02:28,148
I mean, all the rich white
folks are gone.

1105
01:02:28,182 --> 01:02:29,183
Oh yeah.

1106
01:02:29,216 --> 01:02:30,585
No tourists.

1107
01:02:30,619 --> 01:02:32,386
Folks are in the street
fighting for justice

1108
01:02:32,419 --> 01:02:33,487
and freedom and love.

1109
01:02:34,888 --> 01:02:35,990
It's been great actually.

1110
01:02:36,023 --> 01:02:38,993
Are you nervous about the fall?

1111
01:02:39,026 --> 01:02:42,564
Like the fall season,
or the fall of society?

1112
01:02:42,597 --> 01:02:45,533
The fall season.

1113
01:02:45,567 --> 01:02:49,236
Like, are you nervous about
a second wave or the elections?

1114
01:02:50,271 --> 01:02:51,438
I think I'm worried about both.

1115
01:02:51,472 --> 01:02:53,207
Think I'm worried about it all.

1116
01:02:53,240 --> 01:02:56,544
Feel like I've been living
in this fuckin' bubble, yo.

1117
01:02:56,578 --> 01:02:58,445
Like this city
sure ain't this country.

1118
01:02:58,479 --> 01:03:00,281
That is for damn sure.

1119
01:03:00,314 --> 01:03:03,217
It's another world once
you get out the city.

1120
01:03:03,250 --> 01:03:05,786
I don't know, I don't feel
afraid like when I'm in Paris,

1121
01:03:05,819 --> 01:03:07,921
but I feel afraid in Oklahoma.

1122
01:03:07,955 --> 01:03:10,558
It's like the guests
on Kristof's show said.

1123
01:03:10,592 --> 01:03:12,727
This country's still
in the middle of a Civil War.

1124
01:03:12,761 --> 01:03:14,061
You watch Kristof?

1125
01:03:14,094 --> 01:03:15,764
Don't we all watch Kristof?
I know him.

1126
01:03:15,796 --> 01:03:18,700
If you ever wanna take some
pics with him, let me know.

1127
01:03:18,733 --> 01:03:23,203
Oh, yeah, I could, I probably
will take you up on that.

1128
01:03:23,237 --> 01:03:25,105
-Word.
-I'm just gonna switch
to the digital,

1129
01:03:25,139 --> 01:03:26,440
because I just ran out of film.

1130
01:03:26,473 --> 01:03:29,977
So, where are you from?

1131
01:03:30,010 --> 01:03:31,211
I'm from Miami.

1132
01:03:31,245 --> 01:03:34,882
Ooh, I love Miami. Beach vibes.

1133
01:03:34,915 --> 01:03:37,885
I love the arts.
I love the people.

1134
01:03:37,918 --> 01:03:39,621
And why'd you come to New York?

1135
01:03:40,354 --> 01:03:41,955
Um...

1136
01:03:41,989 --> 01:03:46,327
You know, I think, think I had
big dreams you know, and

1137
01:03:48,095 --> 01:03:52,801
Miami just got a little,
a little too small.

1138
01:03:52,833 --> 01:03:55,570
My mom died, and I saved up
a bunch of money

1139
01:03:55,603 --> 01:03:57,672
and bought my one-way ticket
here.

1140
01:03:58,972 --> 01:04:01,108
A girl of action.
Boom, boom, boom.

1141
01:04:01,141 --> 01:04:02,309
I like that.

1142
01:04:02,343 --> 01:04:03,778
I don't know about all that.

1143
01:04:03,812 --> 01:04:07,114
You ever see this short film
by Michel Gondry?

1144
01:04:07,147 --> 01:04:09,651
About a guy who has a camera
for a head

1145
01:04:09,684 --> 01:04:11,352
and he keeps bumping
into everything.

1146
01:04:11,385 --> 01:04:12,853
It's kind of how I feel.

1147
01:04:12,886 --> 01:04:15,356
Nope, no fuckin' idea
what you're talking about.

1148
01:04:16,658 --> 01:04:17,891
But I do know,
if you wanna be free,

1149
01:04:17,925 --> 01:04:19,193
you just gotta be free.

1150
01:04:19,226 --> 01:04:20,829
You just gotta take that jump,

1151
01:04:20,861 --> 01:04:22,996
just get out there and be free.

1152
01:04:23,030 --> 01:04:26,033
I don't know.
I just believe in love.

1153
01:04:26,066 --> 01:04:28,202
Erotic love, romantic love,

1154
01:04:28,235 --> 01:04:31,506
love for your brothers
and sisters.

1155
01:04:31,539 --> 01:04:33,608
Otherwise, what else is there?

1156
01:04:33,641 --> 01:04:36,009
You just die, figuratively.

1157
01:04:36,043 --> 01:04:38,379
You got someone special?
You got a lover?

1158
01:04:38,412 --> 01:04:42,349
Um, yeah.
I think so.

1159
01:04:42,383 --> 01:04:43,618
You think?

1160
01:04:43,651 --> 01:04:45,219
I have my hesitations.

1161
01:04:45,252 --> 01:04:46,487
Fuck that!

1162
01:04:48,021 --> 01:04:50,357
If you love somebody,
you just gotta love them.

1163
01:04:50,391 --> 01:04:52,627
You just gotta take that plunge.

1164
01:04:52,660 --> 01:04:55,496
I mean, what if you died?

1165
01:04:55,530 --> 01:04:58,566
You just got Corona next week
and just died, boom.

1166
01:04:58,600 --> 01:04:59,834
What are you gonna do?

1167
01:04:59,868 --> 01:05:00,901
Yeah.

1168
01:05:02,002 --> 01:05:03,036
Yeah, I don't know.

1169
01:05:04,739 --> 01:05:06,006
You wanna take a look?

1170
01:05:06,039 --> 01:05:08,409
These are actually looking
really good.

1171
01:05:08,442 --> 01:05:10,043
- Let me see, let me see, let me see.
-  -Let me show you.

1172
01:05:10,077 --> 01:05:12,379
Ooh, I'm a fuckin' king.

1173
01:05:12,413 --> 01:05:13,748
-Yes.
-Yes.

1174
01:05:13,782 --> 01:05:16,150
And, I think there's some narc
motherfucker

1175
01:05:16,183 --> 01:05:18,152
over there looking at us now.

1176
01:05:18,185 --> 01:05:22,524
Oh, fuck, that's a cop
that's following me.

1177
01:05:22,557 --> 01:05:27,094
Do you mind distracting him?

1178
01:05:27,127 --> 01:05:29,196
Not at all.
I got you, I got you.

1179
01:05:29,229 --> 01:05:32,099
I think I'm gonna go see
about that boy.

1180
01:05:32,132 --> 01:05:33,167
-Okay.
-Okay.

1181
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:35,002
Okay, take that plunge, girl.

1182
01:05:36,103 --> 01:05:37,137
Officer?

1183
01:05:39,239 --> 01:05:42,943
Officer, are you an officer?

1184
01:05:42,976 --> 01:05:46,180
Officer, are you an officer?

1185
01:05:46,213 --> 01:05:49,584
Officer, excuse me, Officer.

1186
01:05:49,617 --> 01:05:51,285
I mean, you ain't gonna
tell me nothing

1187
01:05:51,318 --> 01:05:53,387
about that grease
you got up in your hair?

1188
01:06:05,399 --> 01:06:07,234
Jean-Michel, what's happening,
man?

1189
01:06:07,267 --> 01:06:09,771
Is that like a vacuum cleaner
or something?

1190
01:06:09,804 --> 01:06:11,639
Dude, you're getting famous
all of a sudden

1191
01:06:11,673 --> 01:06:13,240
since I last saw you.

1192
01:06:13,273 --> 01:06:15,577
Hey, keep it low-key,
huh? Keep it low-key.

1193
01:06:15,610 --> 01:06:17,144
Yeah, right.

1194
01:06:17,177 --> 01:06:18,646
Listen, what's the deal?
You, uh--

1195
01:06:18,680 --> 01:06:20,748
Come over here. Let me talk
to you for a second.

1196
01:06:20,782 --> 01:06:24,552
So, I thought you said
that the heiress

1197
01:06:24,586 --> 01:06:27,087
was the one who was gonna be
buying the necklace.
What's up?

1198
01:06:27,120 --> 01:06:29,223
-That's right.
-So what's up with this dude?

1199
01:06:29,256 --> 01:06:31,960
That's Franchini.
He's a jeweler.

1200
01:06:32,025 --> 01:06:34,294
He's gonna check it out,
make sure it's authentic.

1201
01:06:34,328 --> 01:06:36,296
So you got me here
under a bridge

1202
01:06:36,330 --> 01:06:39,399
in a strange place,
a new fuckin' face,
just to get it checked out?

1203
01:06:39,433 --> 01:06:40,768
Hey, what is the deal?

1204
01:06:40,802 --> 01:06:42,770
What's going on there?
Is there a problem?

1205
01:06:42,804 --> 01:06:44,304
No, there's no problem.

1206
01:06:44,338 --> 01:06:45,573
No problem, no problem.

1207
01:06:45,607 --> 01:06:47,374
Okay, so let's see this
necklace then.

1208
01:06:49,511 --> 01:06:51,178
Come on, over here by this rock.

1209
01:06:54,949 --> 01:06:56,518
Okay, give it to me.

1210
01:07:01,890 --> 01:07:04,993
I need to take a sample
of the metal.

1211
01:07:05,058 --> 01:07:08,596
Is it okay if I make a tiny
scratch on part of the necklace?

1212
01:07:08,630 --> 01:07:10,430
Yeah, do what you gotta do, man.

1213
01:07:13,001 --> 01:07:15,035
This is real.

1214
01:07:15,068 --> 01:07:17,539
The gold is good,
and the ruby is good.

1215
01:07:17,572 --> 01:07:19,607
But I wanna check a few things
just to make sure

1216
01:07:19,641 --> 01:07:22,376
it's the actual Evening Sun.

1217
01:07:22,409 --> 01:07:24,478
I'm gonna take a couple photo,
okay?

1218
01:07:24,512 --> 01:07:26,514
Hey, do what you gotta do.
Just be quick about it,
all right?

1219
01:07:26,548 --> 01:07:28,115
I know we gotta be cool
and shit, Gus,

1220
01:07:28,148 --> 01:07:30,117
but all I'm saying is we really
out here in the open.

1221
01:07:30,150 --> 01:07:32,820
We out here, out here.
We real conspicuous right now.

1222
01:07:32,854 --> 01:07:35,322
This is New York. No one cares.

1223
01:07:35,355 --> 01:07:38,693
I could be doing this out here
naked, and no one would care.

1224
01:07:38,726 --> 01:07:39,928
So what's up? We good?

1225
01:07:41,930 --> 01:07:43,163
I need to take a look at it.

1226
01:07:43,196 --> 01:07:44,732
Soon as I get in front
of a computer.

1227
01:07:44,766 --> 01:07:47,234
I need about 15 minutes.
Shall I call you when I know?

1228
01:07:47,267 --> 01:07:49,904
Nah, no no no, we,
we gonna go with you.

1229
01:07:49,938 --> 01:07:52,172
You know, my uncle was a cop.

1230
01:07:52,205 --> 01:07:54,042
Yeah, what the fuck is that
supposed to mean?

1231
01:07:54,074 --> 01:07:57,177
It means I need this job
because I need a job right now.

1232
01:07:57,210 --> 01:08:00,380
And I'm a professional.
That doesn't mean I like you.

1233
01:08:00,414 --> 01:08:04,418
Franchini, I told you
I'd vouch for this guy.

1234
01:08:05,753 --> 01:08:08,088
Whatever you've seen
on television,

1235
01:08:08,121 --> 01:08:09,423
I'm telling you he's a good guy.

1236
01:08:09,456 --> 01:08:12,326
And, Franchini,
I know you need the money.

1237
01:08:15,597 --> 01:08:18,231
All right, you can come with me
to my office.

1238
01:08:18,265 --> 01:08:22,269
But, you wait outside
while I verify the necklace.

1239
01:08:23,303 --> 01:08:24,338
All right, fine.

1240
01:08:25,372 --> 01:08:27,775
So let's go. <i>Andiamo.</i>

1241
01:08:35,115 --> 01:08:37,919
Hey, bro,
you're gonna follow us, right?

1242
01:08:39,621 --> 01:08:41,355
Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah. Um...

1243
01:08:41,388 --> 01:08:43,190
You know, I was waiting for
somebody,

1244
01:08:43,223 --> 01:08:44,391
but I'll be right behind you.

1245
01:08:44,424 --> 01:08:46,060
All right. So listen,

1246
01:08:46,094 --> 01:08:48,195
I know you don't have
your phone, so stay close.

1247
01:08:48,228 --> 01:08:50,898
-Come on.
-Yeah, I got you. I got you,
I'll be right there.

1248
01:08:50,932 --> 01:08:53,968
-Right behind you.
-Cool, cool cool.

1249
01:08:54,002 --> 01:08:56,904
All right.
He's waiting for somebody.

1250
01:08:59,306 --> 01:09:00,340
Miche!

1251
01:09:01,676 --> 01:09:03,377
Miche!

1252
01:09:04,444 --> 01:09:06,313
Audrey!
Oh my God.

1253
01:09:12,252 --> 01:09:13,755
-I love you.
-We have to go.

1254
01:09:13,788 --> 01:09:15,056
We gotta go. I love you too.

1255
01:09:15,089 --> 01:09:16,390
We gotta go. We gotta go.

1256
01:09:16,423 --> 01:09:18,158
I'mma take your bag.
I'mma take your bag.

1257
01:09:18,191 --> 01:09:19,994
We going. We going.
I'mma take the keys.

1258
01:09:20,028 --> 01:09:21,763
You driving, all right.
Its' better, It's better,
trust me.

1259
01:09:21,796 --> 01:09:23,998
-I'm driving. Okay.
-We gone, we out we out,
let's go.

1260
01:09:25,533 --> 01:09:26,934
Which one is it?

1261
01:09:26,968 --> 01:09:28,903
Quick, quickly.

1262
01:09:36,376 --> 01:09:40,782
Yo, you can, you can follow
that black SUV up there.

1263
01:09:40,815 --> 01:09:42,449
So, did you sell it?

1264
01:09:42,482 --> 01:09:44,619
No, no, it's not that easy.

1265
01:09:44,652 --> 01:09:46,621
The heiress had her jewel man
come,

1266
01:09:46,654 --> 01:09:49,857
and now he's taking pictures
and double-checking
on the internet,

1267
01:09:49,891 --> 01:09:51,659
making sure
that's The Evening Sun.

1268
01:09:51,693 --> 01:09:54,428
It is The Evening Sun,
but he's gotta make sure

1269
01:09:54,461 --> 01:09:56,329
that things are good on his end
so that we can get

1270
01:09:56,363 --> 01:09:58,866
outta here, hopefully tonight.

1271
01:09:58,900 --> 01:10:01,468
How did things go with Tyson?

1272
01:10:01,501 --> 01:10:06,339
Good, he told me to seize love
because it's all we got.

1273
01:10:06,373 --> 01:10:07,842
Nice.

1274
01:10:07,875 --> 01:10:08,910
Nice.

1275
01:10:09,744 --> 01:10:10,978
And?

1276
01:10:11,012 --> 01:10:12,046
I'm good.

1277
01:10:12,080 --> 01:10:13,114
You're good?

1278
01:10:14,481 --> 01:10:15,950
So you--you got me?

1279
01:10:17,018 --> 01:10:18,052
I got you.

1280
01:10:19,252 --> 01:10:21,556
All right, all right.

1281
01:10:21,589 --> 01:10:24,525
I might have fucked up,
but you got me

1282
01:10:24,559 --> 01:10:27,327
so we gonna be all right, right?

1283
01:10:27,360 --> 01:10:29,063
Does this car have a stereo?

1284
01:10:29,664 --> 01:10:31,132
Yeah.

1285
01:10:34,401 --> 01:10:36,537
<i>And in other news,</i>

All right.

You know, I didn't even mean
to--to do all that.

1297
01:11:04,732 --> 01:11:07,602
May--maybe, maybe I should
just, you know, turn myself in.

1298
01:11:07,635 --> 01:11:10,838
No, you're not turning yourself
in, Jean-Michel.

1299
01:11:13,107 --> 01:11:16,177
I just don't wanna take away
from the movement, you know.

1300
01:11:16,210 --> 01:11:19,580
What you did wasn't right, but

1301
01:11:19,614 --> 01:11:23,117
the system is fucked
and it's rigged, against you.

1302
01:11:24,786 --> 01:11:28,856
You fucked up
in a fucked up world, so...

1303
01:11:30,124 --> 01:11:32,093
you run.

1304
01:11:32,126 --> 01:11:36,130
Yeah, but two wrongs
ain't never made a right.

1305
01:11:36,164 --> 01:11:38,365
You know, and I, I...

1306
01:11:38,398 --> 01:11:40,467
Who knows?
It's bigger than me now.

1307
01:11:41,769 --> 01:11:43,436
I gotta think about
the movement.

1308
01:11:44,605 --> 01:11:46,140
I gotta think about my family.

1309
01:11:50,278 --> 01:11:52,146
Yeah, just,
just pull up right here.

1310
01:11:52,180 --> 01:11:54,048
I think, I think this is it.

1311
01:11:59,987 --> 01:12:02,990
Franchini and I
be right out.

1312
01:12:03,024 --> 01:12:06,426
It'll take maybe 15, 15 minutes.

1313
01:12:06,459 --> 01:12:08,062
15 minutes, Gus.

1314
01:12:08,095 --> 01:12:10,397
You say 15 minutes,
I believe you. You the man.

1315
01:12:10,430 --> 01:12:11,732
I'm the man.

1316
01:12:11,766 --> 01:12:12,967
You gonna come through
this time, right?

1317
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:14,035
Yeah.

1318
01:12:16,871 --> 01:12:19,140
- Watch me.
- Yeah.

1319
01:12:21,809 --> 01:12:25,246
Uh, I think I'm gonna go
into, uh, bodega,

1320
01:12:25,279 --> 01:12:29,283
get something, to eat,
or just stretch my legs.

1321
01:12:29,317 --> 01:12:30,618
I don't know, you need anything?

1322
01:12:30,651 --> 01:12:32,153
Are you sure it's safe
for you to go out.

1323
01:12:33,187 --> 01:12:34,956
Yeah, yeah, I'll be fine.

1324
01:12:34,989 --> 01:12:36,557
It's right there.

1325
01:12:37,892 --> 01:12:39,392
I'll be good.

1326
01:12:39,426 --> 01:12:40,427
Okay.

1327
01:12:47,134 --> 01:12:48,703
Jean-Michel?

1328
01:12:48,736 --> 01:12:51,105
Shavinma, hey.

1329
01:12:51,138 --> 01:12:55,009
Damn, you the most famous
brother in New York right now.

1330
01:12:55,042 --> 01:12:58,312
Yeah, but, you know,
it's not really like that.

1331
01:12:58,346 --> 01:13:00,348
Why didn't you tell me?

1332
01:13:00,380 --> 01:13:01,816
What are you gonna do?

1333
01:13:01,849 --> 01:13:05,452
I'm gonna run.
I'm getting outta town. Hey, um,

1334
01:13:05,485 --> 01:13:08,222
matter of fact, could you,
could you tell

1335
01:13:08,256 --> 01:13:10,457
my moms that everything'll
be all right?

1336
01:13:10,490 --> 01:13:12,126
Okay.

1337
01:13:12,159 --> 01:13:14,562
You think, um,

1338
01:13:14,595 --> 01:13:16,731
you think I'm making
the right choice running away?

1339
01:13:16,764 --> 01:13:20,568
You should definitely run.
Do not turn yourself in.

1340
01:13:20,601 --> 01:13:21,869
Okay.

1341
01:13:23,503 --> 01:13:24,538
Yeah.

1342
01:13:24,572 --> 01:13:25,606
Jean-Michel?

1343
01:13:26,707 --> 01:13:27,742
Be careful.

1344
01:13:28,843 --> 01:13:29,911
Be safe.

1345
01:13:40,354 --> 01:13:43,524
Who is she?
That girl you were talking to.

1346
01:13:43,557 --> 01:13:46,260
Oh, that's, that's Shavinma.

1347
01:13:46,294 --> 01:13:48,229
She lives upstairs from my mom.

1348
01:13:48,262 --> 01:13:50,264
Why is she looking at me like
that?

1349
01:13:50,298 --> 01:13:52,199
We used to date.

1350
01:13:52,233 --> 01:13:54,635
Did she just say White girl?

1351
01:13:55,468 --> 01:13:58,606
No, no. No, no.

1352
01:13:58,639 --> 01:14:02,410
She said, she said,
she said "why, girl?"

1353
01:14:03,544 --> 01:14:07,581
Yeah, wh-why. Why you with him?

1354
01:14:08,783 --> 01:14:11,519
Hey, Franchini said it's legit.

1355
01:14:11,552 --> 01:14:13,287
Of course he said it's legit.
It's legit.

1356
01:14:13,321 --> 01:14:14,288
Yeah.

1357
01:14:14,322 --> 01:14:15,957
So what's up? What's next?

1358
01:14:15,990 --> 01:14:17,725
The heiress is gonna send the
money over to him tonight.

1359
01:14:17,758 --> 01:14:19,660
I'll get it,
bring it over tomorrow,

1360
01:14:19,694 --> 01:14:20,795
the deal'll be complete.

1361
01:14:20,828 --> 01:14:22,029
Whoa whoa whoa, wait,
tomorrow?

1362
01:14:22,063 --> 01:14:23,463
Best I could do, sorry.

1363
01:14:23,496 --> 01:14:25,900
Fine, fine, Gus, fine,
it's fine.

1364
01:14:25,933 --> 01:14:28,202
You don't have a place to stay
tonight, do you?

1365
01:14:28,235 --> 01:14:33,441
Brooklyn, 101 Johnson Street,
Number 209.

1366
01:14:33,473 --> 01:14:35,475
It's a cyc studio
I help my brother run.

1367
01:14:35,509 --> 01:14:37,979
And uh, the heiress,
she's tough.

1368
01:14:38,012 --> 01:14:40,147
Franchini, they just want me
to do it.

1369
01:14:40,181 --> 01:14:41,816
They want me
to hold onto the necklace.

1370
01:14:41,849 --> 01:14:44,218
Gus, are you serious?

1371
01:14:44,251 --> 01:14:46,287
I'm serious, but what
I'm asking you, is it cool?

1372
01:14:46,320 --> 01:14:49,724
Because if it isn't,
I will tell them to fuck off,

1373
01:14:49,757 --> 01:14:51,158
and you could have it.

1374
01:14:51,192 --> 01:14:53,427
But I really think
we oughta follow their lead.

1375
01:14:53,461 --> 01:14:55,463
Yeah, yeah, Gus.
You know, uh,

1376
01:14:55,495 --> 01:14:57,698
you know, you know
I trust you, right?

1377
01:15:01,102 --> 01:15:02,603
- Okay.
- You be safe.

1378
01:15:02,636 --> 01:15:04,171
You be safe.
I'll see you tomorrow.

1379
01:15:04,205 --> 01:15:06,140
Yeah, tomorrow.

1380
01:15:08,609 --> 01:15:12,213
Fucking tomorrow.

1381
01:15:29,163 --> 01:15:31,999
I think I've shot
in this building before.

1382
01:15:32,033 --> 01:15:33,667
Hm. Yeah?

1383
01:15:33,701 --> 01:15:35,503
Yeah.

1384
01:15:35,536 --> 01:15:37,872
He said 209, right?

1385
01:15:37,905 --> 01:15:40,007
Yeah, yeah,
but how can you tell?

1386
01:15:40,041 --> 01:15:42,209
None of these doors
got any numbers on them.

1387
01:15:42,243 --> 01:15:44,945
Audrey? Audrey, is that you?

1388
01:15:44,979 --> 01:15:47,516
- Oh shit.
- Oh my God, it is you.

1389
01:15:47,548 --> 01:15:48,883
Ha, Mark.

1390
01:15:48,916 --> 01:15:51,385
Air kiss, mwah, air kiss, mwah.

1391
01:15:51,419 --> 01:15:53,287
Oh my God,
what are you doing here?

1392
01:15:53,320 --> 01:15:56,157
You don't have a shoot
right now at like 11 at night.

1393
01:15:56,190 --> 01:15:58,692
Tell me, tell me, how have you
been surviving the summer?

1394
01:15:58,726 --> 01:16:01,028
Weirdest summer ever,
am I right?

1395
01:16:01,062 --> 01:16:03,532
Hi, I'm so rude.
Hello, I'm Mark.

1396
01:16:03,564 --> 01:16:05,733
Uh, Booth.

1397
01:16:05,766 --> 01:16:08,469
Booth, weird name, but okay,
elbow handshake.

1398
01:16:08,502 --> 01:16:10,037
Ah. I'm all right, thank you.

1399
01:16:10,905 --> 01:16:13,174
So tell me, tell me.

1400
01:16:13,207 --> 01:16:17,011
So yeah, we are shooting
some publicity shots for him,

1401
01:16:17,044 --> 01:16:19,246
because he's dropping a single
tomorrow,

1402
01:16:19,280 --> 01:16:21,248
and this magazine
just asked for a couple shots

1403
01:16:21,282 --> 01:16:22,517
and we found this place.

1404
01:16:22,551 --> 01:16:24,051
What about you?
What are you doing here?

1405
01:16:24,085 --> 01:16:26,253
This is where my studio is.
It's right around there.

1406
01:16:26,287 --> 01:16:27,822
Just some late-night painting.

1407
01:16:27,855 --> 01:16:30,224
I've always been my best
in the middle of the night.

1408
01:16:30,257 --> 01:16:31,892
Hm.

1409
01:16:31,926 --> 01:16:33,727
Do you know where 209 is?

1410
01:16:33,761 --> 01:16:37,832
Oh, Just around there,
to the left, one door down.

1411
01:16:37,865 --> 01:16:39,600
Great, thank you so much.

1412
01:16:39,633 --> 01:16:41,536
Yeah, oh my God,
great catching up.

1413
01:16:41,570 --> 01:16:43,070
You should come by
when you two are done.

1414
01:16:43,104 --> 01:16:45,507
I've got a jug of spicy
margaritas in my fridge.

1415
01:16:57,751 --> 01:16:58,786
Oh, nice.

1416
01:17:03,991 --> 01:17:06,961
Wow, huh.

1417
01:17:06,994 --> 01:17:10,599
This space is really
fuckin' dope.

1418
01:17:10,631 --> 01:17:13,467
Is this where y'all take
your pictures and all
that stuff?

1419
01:17:13,501 --> 01:17:14,902
Mm-hm.

1420
01:17:14,935 --> 01:17:16,538
Yeah.

1421
01:17:16,571 --> 01:17:19,039
Oh, man.

1422
01:17:19,073 --> 01:17:21,709
Do you think it was crazy that
I gave Gus the necklace?

1423
01:17:21,742 --> 01:17:24,478
Like, like, like, you know,
he probably gonna do
what he's supposed to do,

1424
01:17:24,513 --> 01:17:26,981
but as soon as you trust
somebody, they...

1425
01:17:27,014 --> 01:17:28,617
Chill, you're good.

1426
01:17:29,584 --> 01:17:31,952
You trust him, right?

1427
01:17:31,986 --> 01:17:35,156
Yeah, yeah, you right.
You right.

1428
01:17:35,189 --> 01:17:36,625
And then tomorrow
you're gonna get

1429
01:17:36,657 --> 01:17:38,792
the money in the morning, right?

1430
01:17:38,826 --> 01:17:39,860
Tomorrow morning.

1431
01:17:43,497 --> 01:17:48,469
I mean, I don't see why not,
right?

1432
01:17:48,502 --> 01:17:52,641
I mean, this, this heiress,
she wants the necklace
real bad,

1433
01:17:52,673 --> 01:17:55,843
and she getting it for sale, so.

1434
01:18:02,816 --> 01:18:03,918
You scared?

1435
01:18:05,186 --> 01:18:06,220
Running away?

1436
01:18:07,488 --> 01:18:08,523
No.

1437
01:18:09,290 --> 01:18:10,324
Nah, n...

1438
01:18:12,793 --> 01:18:13,827
No.

1439
01:18:17,831 --> 01:18:18,866
You?

1440
01:18:20,501 --> 01:18:21,536
Yeah.

1441
01:18:28,175 --> 01:18:31,111
You know what
I'm really scared of?

1442
01:18:32,647 --> 01:18:33,682
What?

1443
01:18:36,217 --> 01:18:37,284
You know, the news,

1444
01:18:38,419 --> 01:18:40,020
politicians,

1445
01:18:41,556 --> 01:18:43,023
everybody got an opinion.

1446
01:18:43,057 --> 01:18:46,126
Nobody... wants to talk to me.

1447
01:18:48,262 --> 01:18:49,463
People wanna vilify me.

1448
01:18:49,496 --> 01:18:50,532
People wanna

1449
01:18:52,701 --> 01:18:54,068
call me a hero.

1450
01:18:58,540 --> 01:19:01,041
I just don't wanna leave
without saying my piece.

1451
01:19:04,278 --> 01:19:07,582
I just wanna tell people
what I'm thinking.

1452
01:19:07,616 --> 01:19:09,149
Well, what are you thinking?

1453
01:19:18,192 --> 01:19:20,629
I, I, I don't fuckin' know.

1454
01:19:22,564 --> 01:19:24,331
I don't fuckin' know.

1455
01:19:27,434 --> 01:19:28,802
What if we...

1456
01:19:31,706 --> 01:19:35,510
what if we could get you
on Kristof's show?

1457
01:19:35,543 --> 01:19:38,445
You know, like a,
like a Kristof exclusive,

1458
01:19:38,479 --> 01:19:40,615
so you could tell your side
of the story.

1459
01:19:40,649 --> 01:19:43,752
Yeah, I mean, that,
that would be perfect.

1460
01:19:45,319 --> 01:19:47,087
But, but he's like famous,
famous.

1461
01:19:47,121 --> 01:19:50,625
He got like 30,000 DMs right
now. I don't even know him.

1462
01:19:53,060 --> 01:19:54,428
Tyson Barrega knows him.

1463
01:19:56,297 --> 01:19:58,098
He said he could connect me.

1464
01:20:01,235 --> 01:20:03,738
Okay, I'm gonna try,
why don't I try?

1465
01:20:03,772 --> 01:20:05,072
Let me, let me just try.

1466
01:20:05,105 --> 01:20:08,543
Okay, I'm gonna call him
on WhatsApp,

1467
01:20:08,576 --> 01:20:10,811
because I--I think that's harder
to trace.

1468
01:20:11,613 --> 01:20:13,881
Hey, Tyson.

1469
01:20:13,914 --> 01:20:16,283
Hey, yeah, it's Audrey.
No I'm good, I'm good.

1470
01:20:16,317 --> 01:20:19,286
Um, remember how
you were saying you could

1471
01:20:19,320 --> 01:20:21,121
get me in contact with Kristof?

1472
01:20:22,923 --> 01:20:26,795
Yeah, I was wondering if you
could give me his contact?

1473
01:20:29,129 --> 01:20:32,299
I'm with Jean-Michel Coley
and...

1474
01:20:32,333 --> 01:20:35,637
No, it's not like that, but

1475
01:20:35,670 --> 01:20:38,339
he would like
to do an exclusive
on Kristof's show.

1476
01:20:39,674 --> 01:20:40,742
Oh, okay.

1477
01:20:41,942 --> 01:20:44,244
Cool, yeah yeah yeah, I got it.

1478
01:20:44,278 --> 01:20:45,814
Thank you, thank you.

1479
01:20:47,314 --> 01:20:48,349
Okay.

1480
01:20:49,850 --> 01:20:51,519
Calling Kristof.

1481
01:20:56,791 --> 01:20:57,826
Hello?

1482
01:20:59,026 --> 01:21:02,329
Hi, this is Audrey Lasko.

1483
01:21:02,363 --> 01:21:04,365
No, yeah. You don't know me.

1484
01:21:04,398 --> 01:21:07,368
I'm a photographer. Tyson
Barrega gave me your number.

1485
01:21:08,168 --> 01:21:10,805
Yeah, hi. Um...

1486
01:21:10,839 --> 01:21:13,240
I'm with Jean-Michel Coley
right now.

1487
01:21:14,208 --> 01:21:16,544
No, still at large.

1488
01:21:16,578 --> 01:21:20,615
And, he is actually
probably going to be

1489
01:21:20,648 --> 01:21:24,017
disappearing more permanently
tomorrow.

1490
01:21:24,051 --> 01:21:26,621
And he'd like to do
an interview on your show

1491
01:21:26,654 --> 01:21:28,523
to tell the public
his side of the story

1492
01:21:28,556 --> 01:21:29,791
regarding the shooting.

1493
01:21:29,824 --> 01:21:32,092
Would you be interested
in an interview?

1494
01:21:34,596 --> 01:21:36,397
Yeah, of course,
it would be remote.

1495
01:21:37,398 --> 01:21:38,767
Yeah, we have Wi-Fi here.

1496
01:21:41,001 --> 01:21:44,138
Okay, cool, uh, we will set up.

1497
01:21:45,439 --> 01:21:46,473
Thank you.

1498
01:21:51,513 --> 01:21:55,048
Kristof will interview you
on his show in an hour.

1499
01:21:56,718 --> 01:21:58,853
Are you fuckin' serious?

1500
01:21:58,887 --> 01:22:01,856
I, I don't know what the fuck
I'm gonna say.

1501
01:22:01,890 --> 01:22:04,158
I'mma set up some lights.

1502
01:22:04,191 --> 01:22:05,860
Oh, that looks good.

1503
01:22:05,894 --> 01:22:07,796
Thank you.

1504
01:22:07,829 --> 01:22:11,599
Oh, wow, you really did
your thing with these lights.

1505
01:22:12,433 --> 01:22:13,601
I am a professional.

1506
01:22:13,635 --> 01:22:14,903
I know this.

1507
01:22:14,935 --> 01:22:16,236
Ready?

1508
01:22:22,476 --> 01:22:25,179
<i>Hello, Jean-Michel Coley,</i>
<i>I'm Kristof.</i>

1509
01:22:25,212 --> 01:22:28,348
<i>-Welcome to my show.</i>
-Hey, Kristof,

1510
01:22:28,382 --> 01:22:30,083
good to meet you. I'm a big fan.

1511
01:22:30,117 --> 01:22:31,118
<i>Well, thank you for watching.</i>

1512
01:22:31,151 --> 01:22:33,053
<i>It's always nice to meet a fan.</i>

1513
01:22:33,086 --> 01:22:36,023
Yeah, no, I got a ton
of respect for what you do.

1514
01:22:36,056 --> 01:22:38,959
It takes a lot
to go out every day,

1515
01:22:38,992 --> 01:22:42,530
you know, it's intense.

1516
01:22:42,564 --> 01:22:45,432
<i>Yeah, and it's, it's tiring.</i>
<i>Uh...</i>

1517
01:22:45,466 --> 01:22:47,434
<i>But I can't stop myself.</i>
<i>It's like,</i>

1518
01:22:47,468 --> 01:22:49,604
<i>it's like some</i>
<i>sickness inside me.</i>

1519
01:22:49,637 --> 01:22:51,138
I feel you, I feel you.

1520
01:22:51,171 --> 01:22:53,775
It's like a fire in your belly
or something, right?

1521
01:22:53,808 --> 01:22:55,710
<i>Well,</i>
<i>thank you for joining me</i>

1522
01:22:55,743 --> 01:22:57,211
<i>and giving me this exclusive.</i>

1523
01:22:57,244 --> 01:22:58,913
<i>All right,</i>
<i>so how do you wanna do this?</i>

1524
01:22:58,947 --> 01:23:01,716
<i>Do you wanna just tell me</i>
<i>your side of the story?</i>

1525
01:23:01,749 --> 01:23:04,151
Yeah, that sounds good.

1526
01:23:04,184 --> 01:23:05,954
That sounds good.

1527
01:23:09,256 --> 01:23:11,826
Look, I know what I did
was wrong.

1528
01:23:14,061 --> 01:23:17,364
It's not like I don't have
morals or something like that.

1529
01:23:18,867 --> 01:23:20,902
I just reacted impetuously.

1530
01:23:22,637 --> 01:23:23,671
Impulsively.

1531
01:23:25,339 --> 01:23:27,575
Because I thought
I was gonna die.

1532
01:23:27,609 --> 01:23:30,912
That cop said that
he was gonna light me up.

1533
01:23:30,945 --> 01:23:32,914
It's the same shit they said
to Sandra Bland

1534
01:23:32,947 --> 01:23:35,315
before she got murdered.

1535
01:23:35,349 --> 01:23:38,753
And, and, and I know if you
go back and look at the video,

1536
01:23:38,786 --> 01:23:41,789
you could see that I tried
to help him, right?

1537
01:23:41,823 --> 01:23:45,259
I tried, but he pushed me away.

1538
01:23:45,292 --> 01:23:47,227
He pushed me away me,
he fuckin' spit at me.

1539
01:23:47,261 --> 01:23:48,262
He called me...

1540
01:23:55,035 --> 01:23:58,740
The officer in question
didn't want my help.

1541
01:24:00,173 --> 01:24:03,310
You know, Kristof, you ever,

1542
01:24:03,343 --> 01:24:05,479
you ever been stopped
while you was driving?

1543
01:24:05,513 --> 01:24:06,814
No, no reason at all.

1544
01:24:06,848 --> 01:24:09,216
You ever been followed
in a grocery store

1545
01:24:09,249 --> 01:24:12,119
while you was picking up
your almond milk?

1546
01:24:13,420 --> 01:24:16,658
<i>I think I've actually never</i>

1547
01:24:16,691 --> 01:24:18,292
<i>been pulled over while driving.</i>

1548
01:24:18,325 --> 01:24:20,995
Never?

1549
01:24:21,029 --> 01:24:22,396
You gotta be fuckin' kidding me.

1550
01:24:22,429 --> 01:24:25,499
I don't even wanna talk
about it anymore, man.

1551
01:24:25,533 --> 01:24:27,936
You ain't even fully
like white white, right?

1552
01:24:29,037 --> 01:24:30,070
Shit.

1553
01:24:32,272 --> 01:24:34,374
Listen, I--I snapped.

1554
01:24:35,843 --> 01:24:36,978
I was tired.

1555
01:24:38,078 --> 01:24:39,847
And I fuckin' snapped.

1556
01:24:39,881 --> 01:24:41,481
<i>So if you know what you did</i>
<i>was wrong,</i>

1557
01:24:41,516 --> 01:24:43,685
<i>are you planning</i>
<i>to turn yourself in?</i>

1558
01:24:43,718 --> 01:24:45,152
No.

1559
01:24:45,185 --> 01:24:46,988
No, no no.

1560
01:24:47,021 --> 01:24:50,925
I mean my--my--my pops died
in jail. I ca... I can't.

1561
01:24:52,894 --> 01:24:54,862
Did you ever read
<i>Crime and Punishment?</i>

1562
01:24:54,896 --> 01:24:56,531
<i>By Dostoevsky?</i>

1563
01:24:56,564 --> 01:24:58,900
<i>Yeah, I read it, but,</i>
<i>you know, it's been a minute.</i>

1564
01:24:58,933 --> 01:25:02,937
Yeah, I been thinking a lot
about the dude in that book.

1565
01:25:02,971 --> 01:25:08,710
Now Dostoevsky writes that
the man with a conscience

1566
01:25:08,743 --> 01:25:11,445
suffers whilst acknowledging
his own sin.

1567
01:25:12,947 --> 01:25:15,516
And that's his punishment,

1568
01:25:16,751 --> 01:25:18,620
and his prison.

1569
01:25:18,653 --> 01:25:22,189
<i>So you're saying that</i>
<i>you're in your own</i>
<i>prison right now?</i>

1570
01:25:22,222 --> 01:25:24,224
Yeah.

1571
01:25:24,257 --> 01:25:26,761
Ay, metaphorically speaking,
we all are, right.

1572
01:25:26,794 --> 01:25:31,365
Nah, I just,
I get to take mine with me.

1573
01:25:31,398 --> 01:25:32,900
I'll tell you this, though.

1574
01:25:32,934 --> 01:25:35,603
I ain't gonna end up
in one of them physical ones.

1575
01:25:35,637 --> 01:25:38,606
They're gonna have
to put me in a box first.

1576
01:26:11,606 --> 01:26:12,573
You okay?

1577
01:26:12,607 --> 01:26:14,542
Yeah. Yeah, I'm good.

1578
01:26:18,846 --> 01:26:21,082
You sure you're okay?

1579
01:26:21,115 --> 01:26:22,984
You seem a little off.

1580
01:26:24,786 --> 01:26:28,790
Nah, I'm all right.
I'm all right. Um...

1581
01:26:28,823 --> 01:26:31,826
You know, a little tired.

1582
01:26:31,859 --> 01:26:35,096
Feel kinda bad for dragging you
into all of this.

1583
01:26:35,129 --> 01:26:37,264
You don't have to come
if you don't want to.

1584
01:26:38,198 --> 01:26:39,433
I told you I want to.

1585
01:26:41,703 --> 01:26:44,772
You know, you kinda crazy.
You know that?

1586
01:26:46,174 --> 01:26:49,744
But for real,
I could turn myself in.

1587
01:26:50,812 --> 01:26:52,013
I could go to jail.

1588
01:26:52,046 --> 01:26:54,682
I could... get three hots
and a cot,

1589
01:26:54,716 --> 01:26:58,385
and some peace and quiet,
if I fight for it.

1590
01:27:00,420 --> 01:27:02,422
What are you talking about?

1591
01:27:05,193 --> 01:27:07,695
It's nothing. It's nothing.

1592
01:27:09,197 --> 01:27:10,832
Come on, come on.
Let's wrestle.

1593
01:27:10,865 --> 01:27:12,200
I don't feel,
I don't feel like wrestling.

1594
01:27:12,232 --> 01:27:13,668
-Let's go.
-Hey, ho.

1595
01:27:13,701 --> 01:27:14,869
Come on.

1596
01:27:14,902 --> 01:27:17,972
Oh, oh, okay, all right,
here we go.

1597
01:27:18,005 --> 01:27:20,575
I am supreme!

1598
01:27:23,111 --> 01:27:24,679
Hey, that must be Gus.

1599
01:27:24,712 --> 01:27:26,480
See, we're gonna be okay.

1600
01:27:26,514 --> 01:27:27,949
Miche.

1601
01:27:30,383 --> 01:27:33,855
Yo, Gus. Come in,
come on, come on.

1602
01:27:38,926 --> 01:27:39,961
So,

1603
01:27:41,896 --> 01:27:43,497
-this is it.
-Yeah?

1604
01:27:43,531 --> 01:27:46,534
This is the money.
I already took my cut,

1605
01:27:46,567 --> 01:27:48,268
so it's all yours.

1606
01:27:48,301 --> 01:27:51,606
Holy shit, Gus.
Gus, you really did it, man.

1607
01:27:51,639 --> 01:27:54,274
- Yeah. Yeah, I did.
- Fuck.

1608
01:27:54,307 --> 01:27:56,409
You really fuckin' did it.

1609
01:28:00,081 --> 01:28:02,250
Gus, man, thank you.

1610
01:28:03,383 --> 01:28:05,219
Thank you.

1611
01:28:05,253 --> 01:28:07,287
Ah, I guess we all good, right?

1612
01:28:07,320 --> 01:28:08,623
All good.

1613
01:28:11,626 --> 01:28:12,627
Don't know why I did that.

1614
01:28:12,660 --> 01:28:13,895
You okay?

1615
01:28:13,928 --> 01:28:16,531
I'm okay. I'm good, I'm good.

1616
01:28:18,398 --> 01:28:19,366
Audrey?

1617
01:28:19,399 --> 01:28:20,535
Who's that?

1618
01:28:20,568 --> 01:28:23,336
Audrey? Audrey, you there?

1619
01:28:24,404 --> 01:28:25,773
It's this artist I know

1620
01:28:25,807 --> 01:28:27,642
who has a studio on the floor.

1621
01:28:27,675 --> 01:28:29,644
I'll handle it. I'll handle it.

1622
01:28:29,677 --> 01:28:31,913
-What's up, Mark?
-I thought you'd still be here.

1623
01:28:31,946 --> 01:28:34,048
Uh, I need to speak with you.

1624
01:28:36,184 --> 01:28:37,317
Oh boy.

1625
01:28:37,350 --> 01:28:38,920
What's up, Mark?

1626
01:28:38,953 --> 01:28:40,888
Yeah, I racked my mind
all night, and then it hit me.

1627
01:28:40,922 --> 01:28:43,090
That guy you were with,
I know who he is.

1628
01:28:43,124 --> 01:28:45,425
He's Jean-Michel Coley,
the cop killer.

1629
01:28:45,458 --> 01:28:47,494
The murderer.

1630
01:28:47,528 --> 01:28:48,830
No, it's not. He's a singer.

1631
01:28:48,863 --> 01:28:50,164
Don't lie to me.

1632
01:28:50,198 --> 01:28:52,499
I looked him up,
I studied his photos.

1633
01:28:52,533 --> 01:28:55,468
In spite of the mask, I never
forget someone's eyes.

1634
01:28:55,502 --> 01:28:56,737
I know it's him, honey.

1635
01:28:56,771 --> 01:28:58,405
Mark, what did you do?

1636
01:28:58,438 --> 01:29:00,107
You called the cops, didn't you?

1637
01:29:00,141 --> 01:29:01,474
It's for your own good.

1638
01:29:01,509 --> 01:29:04,312
Oh, you fucking...

1639
01:29:04,344 --> 01:29:06,747
He's dangerous. I'm sure
he's just using you.

1640
01:29:06,781 --> 01:29:08,348
You don't even know
anything about him.

1641
01:29:08,381 --> 01:29:10,184
Fucking annihilate you.

1642
01:29:10,218 --> 01:29:13,087
Oh my God, my nose. You bitch!

1643
01:29:17,457 --> 01:29:20,294
Shit, shit, shit,
he called the cops.
We gotta get outta here.

1644
01:29:20,328 --> 01:29:21,796
What the fuck you mean
he called the cops?

1645
01:29:21,829 --> 01:29:23,097
I thought you said he was cool!

1646
01:29:23,130 --> 01:29:24,932
I thought he was,
but he definitely isn't!

1647
01:29:24,966 --> 01:29:26,433
What the fuck?

1648
01:29:26,466 --> 01:29:27,602
Come on.

1649
01:29:27,635 --> 01:29:29,136
All right,
the money's in this bag.

1650
01:29:29,170 --> 01:29:31,973
You, you, you grab
your camera bag.

1651
01:29:32,006 --> 01:29:33,373
Let's go, let's go.

1652
01:29:35,209 --> 01:29:36,244
Let's go.

1653
01:29:54,695 --> 01:29:56,530
-Wait, I need to tie my shoes.
-Yeah, go ahead.

1654
01:29:56,564 --> 01:29:58,132
Hold on,
I need to tie my shoes.

1655
01:29:58,165 --> 01:30:01,002
Get the keys in the, in the bag,
it's the front pocket.

1656
01:30:01,035 --> 01:30:03,704
Freeze, NYPD!

1657
01:30:04,906 --> 01:30:06,040
Okay, okay.

1658
01:30:07,275 --> 01:30:08,976
Let's go.

1659
01:30:09,010 --> 01:30:11,145
Shit! Shit!

1660
01:30:13,514 --> 01:30:16,217
Shit!

1661
01:30:23,456 --> 01:30:24,859
Something's wrong with the car.

1662
01:30:24,892 --> 01:30:25,927
Girl, we gotta go. We gotta go.

1663
01:30:28,362 --> 01:30:31,732
Jean-Michel, Audrey, freeze!
We don't wanna shoot!

1664
01:30:31,766 --> 01:30:34,201
Fuck, I can't get a fuckin'
angle on them.

1665
01:30:34,235 --> 01:30:36,771
Is that the only fuckin' word
you know? Shit, fuck!

1666
01:30:36,804 --> 01:30:38,839
Stop, goddammit.

1667
01:30:40,107 --> 01:30:41,142
Shit.

1668
01:30:44,444 --> 01:30:45,513
Fuck, eight minutes,
eight minutes.

1669
01:30:45,546 --> 01:30:47,114
What do we do?

1670
01:30:57,591 --> 01:30:59,260
Did we lose them?

1671
01:30:59,293 --> 01:31:01,195
I think so. I don't see nobody.

1672
01:31:01,228 --> 01:31:04,231
Oh my fucking God.

1673
01:31:04,265 --> 01:31:07,601
Babe, you know you a little bit
of a bad-ass, right?

1674
01:31:07,635 --> 01:31:09,469
Baby, I can literally
throw up right now.

1675
01:31:09,502 --> 01:31:11,105
Throw up?
You musta been like

1676
01:31:11,138 --> 01:31:13,107
track superstar or some shit
like that in high school.

1677
01:31:13,140 --> 01:31:15,176
Yeah.

1678
01:31:16,110 --> 01:31:18,279
We gonna be all right.

1679
01:31:18,312 --> 01:31:19,981
What's next?
What do we do next?

1680
01:31:20,014 --> 01:31:21,882
We gotta figure out how
the fuck we gonna
get outta here.

1681
01:31:21,916 --> 01:31:24,285
How the fuck
do we get outta here?

1682
01:31:24,318 --> 01:31:27,154
Shit.
Shit.

1683
01:31:27,188 --> 01:31:28,422
Hey, yo, isn't that...

1684
01:31:28,456 --> 01:31:29,757
Wait, I think I have an app for
that.

1685
01:31:29,790 --> 01:31:30,891
The Revolt shit,
like the scooter?

1686
01:31:30,925 --> 01:31:31,993
<i>Freeze!</i>

1687
01:31:32,026 --> 01:31:33,794
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

1688
01:31:35,696 --> 01:31:37,398
Fuck!

1689
01:31:37,431 --> 01:31:38,733
Baby!

1690
01:31:38,766 --> 01:31:40,267
-What are you doing?
-What the fuck, man?

1691
01:31:40,301 --> 01:31:42,603
-What are you doing?
-He's the fuckin' cop killer!

1692
01:31:42,636 --> 01:31:43,604
Shut up!

1693
01:31:43,637 --> 01:31:45,339
Baby, baby, can you walk?

1694
01:31:45,373 --> 01:31:46,941
No.

1695
01:31:46,974 --> 01:31:48,509
I blew my fuckin' load.
You got another clip?

1696
01:31:48,542 --> 01:31:49,944
We gotta get outta here.
We gotta fuckin' go right now.

1697
01:31:49,977 --> 01:31:51,979
Jean-Michel, Audrey, you don't
have to do this!

1698
01:31:53,147 --> 01:31:54,515
Turn yourselves in.

1699
01:31:55,850 --> 01:31:56,884
Okay, shoot him.

1700
01:31:58,285 --> 01:32:00,187
Just fuckin' shoot him!
He's right there!

1701
01:32:00,221 --> 01:32:03,024
He's a fuckin' cop killer.
Pull the trigger.

1702
01:32:03,057 --> 01:32:04,558
Pull the fuckin' trigger!

1703
01:32:06,861 --> 01:32:08,162
What are you waiting for?

1704
01:32:09,530 --> 01:32:11,665
Get off me. Get off me!

1705
01:32:13,167 --> 01:32:14,602
I'm making sure
you do fucking desk duty

1706
01:32:14,635 --> 01:32:15,870
for the rest
of your fucking career.

1707
01:32:15,903 --> 01:32:17,104
You're gonna get written up
for this!

1708
01:32:17,138 --> 01:32:19,106
-Me?
-Yeah, you! I'm reporting you!

1709
01:32:22,143 --> 01:32:24,513
You don't fuckin' deserve
that fuckin' badge.

1710
01:34:10,619 --> 01:34:11,652
Hey.

1711
01:34:15,489 --> 01:34:17,424
How'd it go?

1712
01:34:17,458 --> 01:34:20,728
It was good. I think I got
a couple good photos.

1713
01:34:20,761 --> 01:34:23,464
Ah, that's good.
Good is always good, right?

1714
01:34:26,433 --> 01:34:28,269
How's the editing?

1715
01:34:28,302 --> 01:34:30,738
It's actually almost done.

1716
01:34:30,771 --> 01:34:33,107
Exciting. That was fast.

1717
01:34:33,140 --> 01:34:36,043
Yeah, yeah, I got this fire
in my belly right now.

1718
01:34:36,944 --> 01:34:38,078
Or this sickness.

1719
01:34:41,282 --> 01:34:43,751
You, uh...
are you feeling okay?

1720
01:34:46,720 --> 01:34:48,189
I can't do this anymore.

1721
01:34:50,559 --> 01:34:51,593
This is...

1722
01:34:53,060 --> 01:34:54,261
all too lonely.

1723
01:34:54,295 --> 01:34:56,163
Lonely, Audrey, I'm right here.

1724
01:34:56,197 --> 01:34:57,198
I been here this whole--

1725
01:34:57,231 --> 01:34:59,033
But I miss

1726
01:35:01,168 --> 01:35:02,203
everything.

1727
01:35:06,006 --> 01:35:07,041
And you've...

1728
01:35:10,911 --> 01:35:12,046
been distant.

1729
01:35:21,055 --> 01:35:22,089
I'm leaving.

1730
01:35:23,891 --> 01:35:26,528
-I'm sorry.
-Don't apologize

1731
01:35:26,561 --> 01:35:29,496
for what you're feeling,
all right.

1732
01:35:29,531 --> 01:35:31,533
Uh, I get it.

1733
01:35:32,567 --> 01:35:33,668
I get it, you know.

1734
01:35:33,702 --> 01:35:35,936
You gotta do you, and this,

1735
01:35:38,405 --> 01:35:40,441
I guess this ain't you.

1736
01:35:41,742 --> 01:35:43,777
Ah, shit, it was never
your fight anyway.

1737
01:35:52,119 --> 01:35:54,021
Are you leaving today?

1738
01:35:54,054 --> 01:35:55,089
No.

01:35:56,223 --> 01:35:57,758
