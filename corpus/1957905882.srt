1
00:00:11,803 --> 00:00:14,222
I grew up in a
very special place.

2
00:00:14,264 --> 00:00:16,850
Every December, our
block was transformed

3
00:00:16,891 --> 00:00:18,643
into a Christmas wonderland.

4
00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:22,272
And my parents started it all.

5
00:00:22,313 --> 00:00:25,650
It's Christmas.

6
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:26,943
It's Christmas!

7
00:00:26,985 --> 00:00:29,320
Mom, Dad, wake up!

8
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:29,779
Wake up.

9
00:00:29,821 --> 00:00:31,865
Get up.

10
00:00:31,906 --> 00:00:34,367
Where are they?

11
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:38,580
Fine, I guess I'm going to open
all the presents by myself.

12
00:00:38,621 --> 00:00:41,207
Here, I come!

13
00:00:41,249 --> 00:00:44,502
Oh, I hope Santa came.

14
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:46,087
He came!

15
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:51,384
Merry Christmas, sweetie.

16
00:00:51,426 --> 00:00:52,510
Merry Christmas.

17
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:53,303
Merry Christmas.

18
00:00:53,345 --> 00:00:54,763
Can I open my presents?

19
00:00:54,804 --> 00:00:56,014
Oh, not just now, honey.

20
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:57,682
We have to go.

21
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:59,076
We have a lot to do before
the carnival this afternoon.

22
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,227
Yeah, but what about Christmas?

23
00:01:01,269 --> 00:01:03,563
The Christmas carnival
is Christmas, sweetie.

24
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:06,274
We have put so much work
into it to make it special.

25
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:09,444
Yeah, but you've
done so much already.

26
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:11,696
But we have to salt the
sidewalk, light the lamps.

27
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:12,757
Check on the backup generator.

28
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:13,615
Good call.

29
00:01:13,656 --> 00:01:14,115
Come on, sweetie.

30
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:15,408
Don't pout.

31
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,202
You know how important
the carnival is.

32
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:18,953
It's our responsibility.

33
00:01:18,995 --> 00:01:19,746
Our duty.

34
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:20,872
Our duty.

35
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:22,332
Yes, our duty to
make it perfect.

36
00:01:22,374 --> 00:01:25,710
Can I open at least one?

37
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:26,753
Of course.

38
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:28,963
Oh, I think I just the one.

39
00:01:29,005 --> 00:01:30,548
Here.

40
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:33,677
Open this one.

41
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:36,513
Wow.

42
00:01:36,554 --> 00:01:37,972
A camera?

43
00:01:38,014 --> 00:01:39,575
Maybe you'd like to take
pictures of everyone

44
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:42,060
in all the events
today to keep a record

45
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:43,436
of how happy everyone is.

46
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:45,814
You'll be our official
Christmas photographer.

47
00:01:45,855 --> 00:01:50,110
Like for fun or for my duty?

48
00:01:50,151 --> 00:01:52,070
There's no reason it
can't be both, dear.

49
00:01:53,029 --> 00:01:53,738
Merry Christmas, honey.

50
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:54,531
Merry Christmas.

51
00:01:54,572 --> 00:01:54,948
Let's go.

52
00:01:54,989 --> 00:01:55,949
OK.

53
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:56,990
Mmm.

54
00:01:57,867 --> 00:01:58,618
Get bundled up, dear.

55
00:01:58,660 --> 00:01:59,160
Come on.

56
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:00,912
Meet us outside.

57
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:03,748
My parents tried their very
best to instill their Christmas

58
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,458
spirit into me.

59
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:10,005
But when you're seven, you
have other things on your mind.

60
00:02:10,046 --> 00:02:12,757
Up on the
housetop, reindeer paws.

61
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:15,468
Out jumps good, old Santa Claus.

62
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:17,804
You'll never guess what
he brought me this year.

63
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:19,305
What?

64
00:02:19,347 --> 00:02:22,308
I got the entire Frank
Gehry LEGO collection.

65
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:23,560
Who's Frank Harry?

66
00:02:23,601 --> 00:02:25,270
It's Ghery.

67
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:27,981
And he's only the greatest
architect of the 20th century.

68
00:02:28,023 --> 00:02:29,482
Well, that's cool.

69
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:30,400
What's wrong?

70
00:02:30,442 --> 00:02:31,693
Didn't he get anything good?

71
00:02:31,735 --> 00:02:33,194
Just this.

72
00:02:33,236 --> 00:02:34,362
A Polaroid?

73
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:35,238
Cool.

74
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,157
Yeah, well, let's test it.

75
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:41,453
That's so cool.

76
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:43,329
Yeah, except my
parents are going

77
00:02:43,371 --> 00:02:46,041
to make me use it to take
pictures of everyone else

78
00:02:46,082 --> 00:02:47,000
at the carnival.

79
00:02:47,042 --> 00:02:48,084
That sounds awesome.

80
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:48,918
Can I help?

81
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,920
Um, sure.

82
00:02:57,135 --> 00:02:57,927
Can I have this?

83
00:02:57,969 --> 00:02:58,970
Well, I guess.

84
00:03:01,973 --> 00:03:03,183
Let's go.

85
00:03:03,224 --> 00:03:04,493
I'll help you get
people together,

86
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:06,019
and you can take the picture.

87
00:03:06,061 --> 00:03:07,937
It'll be fun.

88
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:09,481
Race you there.

89
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:12,025
Every year, I'm faced
with the same question.

90
00:03:12,067 --> 00:03:15,653
Is Christmas merely the
longest to-do list of all time?

91
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:18,531
Or is all that
work actually fun?

92
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:20,492
Maybe this year I'll find out.

93
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:23,036
Haul out

94
00:03:23,078 --> 00:03:24,496
the holly.

95
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:28,166
Put up the tree before
my spirit falls again.

96
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:31,419
Fill up the stocking.

97
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:38,551
I may be rushing things, but
deck the halls again now!

98
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:43,390
For we need a little Christmas
right this very minute.

99
00:03:43,431 --> 00:03:45,100
Candles on the window.

100
00:03:45,141 --> 00:03:46,726
Carols at the spinet.

101
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:50,271
Yes, we need a little Christmas
right this very minute.

102
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:52,357
It hasn't snowed
a single flurry.

103
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:53,900
We got guys coming left.

104
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:55,110
Coming left.

105
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:56,069
You got to call
him out, you guys.

106
00:03:56,111 --> 00:03:56,945
Come on.

107
00:03:56,986 --> 00:03:58,488
They're breaking in!

108
00:03:58,530 --> 00:03:59,072
Dan?

109
00:03:59,114 --> 00:04:00,198
Left, you guys.

110
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,258
No, you got to call that out.

111
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:01,908
Dan, what are you doing here?

112
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,118
Um, I live here.

113
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:04,345
Well, I thought
you'd be at work.

114
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:05,453
No, I took a personal day.

115
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:07,080
Isn't this a busy season?

116
00:04:07,122 --> 00:04:08,808
Yeah, that's why I get so
stressed during the holidays.

117
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:09,582
Well, don't look.

118
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:10,125
Don't look.

119
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:11,084
Hold on, guys.

120
00:04:11,126 --> 00:04:11,918
No, no, no, no, no.

121
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,253
I said don't look.

122
00:04:13,294 --> 00:04:14,921
That's like saying
don't think of tigers.

123
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:16,607
I mean, the first thing you're
going to do is think of tigers.

124
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:18,508
Oh, I wanted all this
to be a surprise.

125
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:19,551
Wait, this is for me?

126
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:20,135
Yeah.

127
00:04:20,176 --> 00:04:21,219
Like all of it?

128
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:21,886
Yeah, I went a little crazy.

129
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:23,263
I know.

130
00:04:23,304 --> 00:04:23,722
But don't feel obligated
to go crazy on me.

131
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:24,763
OK.

132
00:04:26,182 --> 00:04:27,434
Right.

133
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:29,978
I mean, I wouldn't be upset

134
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:31,122
if you got me something nice.

135
00:04:31,146 --> 00:04:32,605
But...

136
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:34,417
Truth be told, I'm not
that big in the presents.

137
00:04:34,441 --> 00:04:35,942
Getting them or
just giving them?

138
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:36,985
Giving mostly.

139
00:04:37,027 --> 00:04:38,111
You remember your birthday?

140
00:04:38,153 --> 00:04:41,031
Oh, yeah, no, no, I remember.

141
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:42,574
I was very disappointed.

142
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:44,659
And I thought I made that point.

143
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:47,120
But it's clear we need to
have another discussion.

144
00:04:47,162 --> 00:04:48,705
Well, we already did.

145
00:04:48,747 --> 00:04:49,497
Remember?

146
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:50,790
You got really mad at me.

147
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:52,226
I said, I have no
idea what you like.

148
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,477
And you said I
should figure it out.

149
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:54,562
And then, I asked you
for a simple list.

150
00:04:54,586 --> 00:04:56,755
I'm not making a list, Dan.

151
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:57,881
I'm not seven.

152
00:04:57,922 --> 00:05:00,133
You said that same
thing last time too.

153
00:05:00,175 --> 00:05:02,969
And that didn't have
any impact on you?

154
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:04,179
Wait, wait, hold on.

155
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:05,722
Are we about to
have another fight?

156
00:05:05,764 --> 00:05:06,765
Well, it depends.

157
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:08,516
OK, can we just
skip it this time?

158
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:10,328
Because I'm really... I'm not
that big into fights either.

159
00:05:10,352 --> 00:05:11,311
OK, I'm going to say it.

160
00:05:11,353 --> 00:05:12,687
I'm... Yeah.

161
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:14,564
I'm going to... I'm
just going to say it.

162
00:05:14,606 --> 00:05:17,567
I have not been very happy in
this relationship lately, Dan.

163
00:05:17,609 --> 00:05:19,235
OK.

164
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:22,197
And that doesn't
seem to bother you?

165
00:05:22,238 --> 00:05:23,656
Oh, well, I don't
want to break up

166
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:25,217
or anything if that's
what you're saying.

167
00:05:25,241 --> 00:05:27,081
Yeah, but you also don't
want to talk about it?

168
00:05:27,118 --> 00:05:28,161
Not really, no.

169
00:05:28,203 --> 00:05:29,371
Right, OK.

170
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:30,830
So then, yeah,
we're breaking up.

171
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:31,331
What?

172
00:05:31,373 --> 00:05:32,082
Seriously?

173
00:05:32,123 --> 00:05:32,832
Just like that?

174
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:34,334
Seriously.

175
00:05:34,376 --> 00:05:35,335
I mean, what is there to
discuss if you won't even

176
00:05:35,377 --> 00:05:36,419
talk about it?

177
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:38,213
Well, I choose not to break up.

178
00:05:38,254 --> 00:05:39,297
What about you?

179
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:40,674
No, this just isn't working.

180
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:42,526
I mean, the first couple
of years were so great.

181
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:45,804
And I swear, it's like this
last year have literally

182
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:46,554
stopped trying.

183
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:47,180
Fine.

184
00:05:47,222 --> 00:05:47,847
You know what?

185
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:48,431
I give up.

186
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:49,349
Case in point!

187
00:05:49,391 --> 00:05:50,308
I can't believe this.

188
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,476
Well, it's your decision.

189
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:53,478
You used to be a lot nicer.

190
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,856
Sorry, that was
the craziest deja vu moment.

191
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:59,067
My ex used to say
that same thing.

192
00:05:59,109 --> 00:06:00,485
It's weird.

193
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:01,486
OK, that's it.

194
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:02,654
I think you should move out.

195
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:03,196
What?

196
00:06:03,238 --> 00:06:04,197
No, no, no.

197
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:05,281
No, I'm going to stay.

198
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:06,324
What do you mean no?

199
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:07,701
No, I found this apartment.

200
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:09,542
I put the entire security
deposit down myself.

201
00:06:09,577 --> 00:06:10,787
Technically, that's true.

202
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:12,622
But you remember
that family reunion

203
00:06:12,664 --> 00:06:13,623
that you had last
summer that just...

204
00:06:13,665 --> 00:06:15,500
I didn't want to go to?

205
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:16,978
Yeah, no, I'm still upset that
you bailed on me for that.

206
00:06:17,002 --> 00:06:19,021
I mean, my Aunt Monica
doesn't even think you exist.

207
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:19,879
That's a fair complaint.

208
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:21,214
But my point is this.

209
00:06:21,256 --> 00:06:23,216
You may recall that
it was the same week

210
00:06:23,258 --> 00:06:24,551
we had to renew the lease.

211
00:06:24,592 --> 00:06:27,470
And so technically, my
name is the only one

212
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:29,139
on any of that paperwork now.

213
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:31,474
You wouldn't.

214
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:33,893
I thought I was helping you out.

215
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:41,484
OK, guys, I'm back.

216
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:42,526
Sorry about that.

217
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:47,157
Oh, honey, I am so sorry.

218
00:06:47,198 --> 00:06:48,491
It's OK.

219
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:50,160
It was bound to happen
sooner or later.

220
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:52,304
Honestly, I don't even know why
I stayed with them this long.

221
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:54,122
Well, then I suppose
it's a good thing.

222
00:06:54,164 --> 00:06:55,433
Yeah, except I have to move out.

223
00:06:55,457 --> 00:06:56,559
Well, where will you go now?

224
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:57,625
I don't know.

225
00:06:57,667 --> 00:06:59,252
I've been looking at listings.

226
00:06:59,294 --> 00:07:00,730
But there isn't much available
until after the New Year.

227
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:01,963
No, I mean for Christmas.

228
00:07:02,005 --> 00:07:03,965
I don't suppose
you're going to Dan's.

229
00:07:04,007 --> 00:07:06,968
Why don't you pack up
and just come home?

230
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:08,636
Mom, no offense.

231
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:10,114
But I really don't think I
can handle an Evergreen Lane

232
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:11,514
Christmas right now.

233
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:12,992
I'm just going to use
my Frequent Flyer miles.

234
00:07:13,016 --> 00:07:14,726
I'll go somewhere
warm and just relax.

235
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:15,435
No, no.

236
00:07:15,477 --> 00:07:16,978
That can't... no.

237
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:18,104
Darling, you can't.

238
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:19,064
You come on home.

239
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:21,274
You can relax with us.

240
00:07:21,316 --> 00:07:23,026
Your father will be so happy.

241
00:07:23,068 --> 00:07:25,945
He's not too busy remodeling
Santa's workshop again?

242
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:27,030
Oh.

243
00:07:27,072 --> 00:07:28,656
No, not this year.

244
00:07:29,657 --> 00:07:31,034
OK, that was your nervous laugh.

245
00:07:31,076 --> 00:07:31,826
What are you hiding?

246
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:33,328
Oh.

247
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:34,287
No, what are
you talking about, dear?

248
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:35,955
Mom, you just did it again.

249
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:37,683
Last time you laughed like
that I found out you got rid

250
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:39,209
of all my Beanie Babies.

251
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:40,335
Oh, no.

252
00:07:40,377 --> 00:07:41,961
It's nothing like that, dear.

253
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:44,297
I'm just hoping that you're
doing OK with the breakup

254
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:45,173
and everything.

255
00:07:45,215 --> 00:07:46,299
It's got to be hard.

256
00:07:46,341 --> 00:07:47,050
Sure.

257
00:07:47,092 --> 00:07:47,801
No, I'm OK.

258
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:49,302
You know what?

259
00:07:49,344 --> 00:07:50,655
I think it's going to be good
to come home for a while.

260
00:07:50,679 --> 00:07:52,097
Right now, I'm off
until New Year's.

261
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:54,557
And I can just relax, and
eat a million cookies,

262
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:55,642
and get some TLC.

263
00:07:55,684 --> 00:07:56,893
I couldn't agree more.

264
00:07:56,935 --> 00:07:58,603
It's been a long
time since you've

265
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:00,563
come home for the holidays.

266
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:02,691
It'll be so wonderful for you.

267
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:03,817
Just do me one favor.

268
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:05,044
Please don't
pressure me too much

269
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:06,569
to do all the
Christmas activities.

270
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:08,905
I really don't think I
have it in me right now.

271
00:08:08,947 --> 00:08:10,490
Don't worry, dear.

272
00:08:10,532 --> 00:08:12,450
Your father and I will
not be pressuring you

273
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:13,451
at all this year.

274
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:15,078
I promise.

275
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,371
All right, thanks, Mom.

276
00:08:16,413 --> 00:08:17,997
I'm just going to
finish packing.

277
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:19,850
And then, I can probably be
down there by dinnertime.

278
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:20,417
Oh.

279
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:21,001
No, no, no.

280
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:21,543
No, no.

281
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:22,419
Tomorrow.

282
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:23,044
Tomorrow, darling.

283
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:24,796
Tomorrow.

284
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:25,940
Your father and I, we've got
plans with the Engerbretson's

285
00:08:25,964 --> 00:08:27,298
tonight.

286
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,133
So I think it would just
be better if you came down

287
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:28,842
in the morning.

288
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:29,718
Is that OK?

289
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,344
Yeah, no, it's totally fine.

290
00:08:31,386 --> 00:08:32,863
I'll just lock the door and
make Dan sleep on the couch.

291
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:34,931
Probably going to be
playing some virtual ogre

292
00:08:34,973 --> 00:08:36,057
fighting thing.

293
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:37,368
I have no idea what
he does all night.

294
00:08:37,392 --> 00:08:38,685
Oh, that's wonderful, dear.

295
00:08:38,727 --> 00:08:40,311
Well, I'm going to
go tell your father.

296
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:41,521
He'll be so excited.

297
00:08:41,563 --> 00:08:42,856
All right.

298
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:43,231
Bye, Mom.

299
00:08:43,273 --> 00:08:44,816
Bye.

300
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:46,401
Are you sure this
is a good idea?

301
00:08:46,443 --> 00:08:48,028
This may be our only hope.

302
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:49,821
Oh.

303
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:51,298
Alpha Niner to team Kringle,
we have a code red and green.

304
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:52,699
I repeat, red and green.

305
00:08:52,741 --> 00:08:54,284
All units assemble.

306
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:55,201
Over.

307
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:56,536
OK, break it down.

308
00:08:56,578 --> 00:08:57,454
It's a red and green?

309
00:08:57,495 --> 00:08:58,204
Yes, it is.

310
00:08:58,246 --> 00:08:59,080
Get the tree.

311
00:08:59,122 --> 00:08:59,706
I've got the tree.

312
00:08:59,748 --> 00:09:01,249
I've got the tree.

313
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:02,208
Can't you take a tree and
pillows at the same time?

314
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,250
I've got the tree.

315
00:09:06,338 --> 00:09:07,398
You've reached Jess' phone.

316
00:09:07,422 --> 00:09:08,298
Leave a message.

317
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:09,924
Hey, it's me.

318
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:13,219
So believe it or not, I am
driving down Main Street.

319
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:14,721
Yep, I'm home.

320
00:09:14,763 --> 00:09:15,990
Listen, we have
so much to catch up on.

321
00:09:16,014 --> 00:09:18,808
But just call me or come
by whenever you can.

322
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:21,144
All right, talk to you soon.

323
00:09:21,186 --> 00:09:22,771
Come on, guys.

324
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:24,915
If you put your backs into
it, you won't feel the cold.

325
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:26,733
Well, they should have layered.

326
00:09:26,775 --> 00:09:29,736
Guys, please, watch
the tulip beds, please.

327
00:09:29,778 --> 00:09:31,071
They are very delicate.

328
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:32,530
Did you hear the lady?

329
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,532
Ah, perennials.

330
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:37,452
So finicky, yet so delightful.

331
00:09:37,494 --> 00:09:38,370
What?

332
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:39,329
OK.

333
00:09:39,371 --> 00:09:42,207
All right, go.

334
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:43,541
Whoa.

335
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,001
Whoa.

336
00:09:45,043 --> 00:09:46,336
Whoa.

337
00:09:46,378 --> 00:09:50,423
OK, sir.

338
00:09:50,465 --> 00:09:54,260
It's there.

339
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:56,137
OK, thank you.

340
00:09:56,179 --> 00:10:02,727
Oh, hi.

341
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:05,730
Welcome home.

342
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:07,023
Proceed with phase two.

343
00:10:07,065 --> 00:10:08,566
Repeat, phase two.

344
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:11,194
Over.

345
00:10:11,236 --> 00:10:12,737
Oh, look, here comes Emily.

346
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:14,823
Oh, right on schedule.

347
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:17,617
She hasn't been home for
the holidays in years.

348
00:10:17,659 --> 00:10:20,286
She doesn't have
any idea, does she?

349
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:21,454
Not a clue.

350
00:10:21,496 --> 00:10:22,622
Buckle up.

351
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:32,632
There she is.

352
00:10:32,674 --> 00:10:33,466
There she is.

353
00:10:33,508 --> 00:10:34,508
Hi.

354
00:10:37,429 --> 00:10:38,972
Oh.

355
00:10:39,014 --> 00:10:39,723
Oh.

356
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:41,683
What's with the get-ups?

357
00:10:43,226 --> 00:10:44,352
You're moving to Florida?

358
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:45,520
That's the plan.

359
00:10:45,562 --> 00:10:46,646
But why?

360
00:10:46,688 --> 00:10:47,522
Well, because it's warm there.

361
00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:48,481
Uncle Dino lives there.

362
00:10:48,523 --> 00:10:49,941
And we can golf year round.

363
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:50,859
A bunch of my college
friends are still there.

364
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,610
Oh, I cannot believe this.

365
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:54,821
Oh, honey, it's not
like we're dying.

366
00:10:54,863 --> 00:10:56,197
We're just moving to Florida.

367
00:10:56,239 --> 00:10:58,283
We're taking our
talents to South Beach.

368
00:10:58,324 --> 00:10:59,325
But when?

369
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:00,386
As soon as we find a place.

370
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:02,746
You mean like online or what?

371
00:11:04,748 --> 00:11:06,291
That must be our
cab to the airport.

372
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:07,417
Airport?

373
00:11:07,459 --> 00:11:09,085
You're literally leaving today?

374
00:11:09,127 --> 00:11:10,128
Yes, sweetie.

375
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:11,588
Our flight leaves
in three hours.

376
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:13,190
You know how your mother
needs to be early.

377
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:14,841
What's wrong with
being a little early?

378
00:11:14,883 --> 00:11:16,569
Nothing, the airport is
40 minutes from here.

379
00:11:16,593 --> 00:11:17,635
If there's no traffic.

380
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:18,821
When is there ever any traffic?

381
00:11:18,845 --> 00:11:20,114
But, Mom, Mom, Mom,
you didn't think

382
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:21,806
it was important to
mention to me that you

383
00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:23,850
were moving to Florida
when we spoke on the phone?

384
00:11:23,892 --> 00:11:25,685
Honey, we weren't
talking about us.

385
00:11:25,727 --> 00:11:27,437
We were focused on you.

386
00:11:27,479 --> 00:11:30,398
And you said you wanted to
come home for the holidays.

387
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,858
Well, here you are.

388
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:34,194
No, I wanted to come
home to be with you guys.

389
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:34,903
Remember?

390
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:36,279
The cookies and the TLC.

391
00:11:36,321 --> 00:11:37,655
We'll be back by New Year's.

392
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:39,258
And in the meantime,
you can make cookies.

393
00:11:39,282 --> 00:11:41,159
You can bake all the
cookies you want.

394
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:41,910
And the neighbors...

395
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:42,869
What?

396
00:11:42,911 --> 00:11:44,329
Will be so happy to see you.

397
00:11:44,371 --> 00:11:45,556
You'll get so much TLC,
you won't know what to do.

398
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:46,414
You know what?

399
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:47,290
I'm already packed.

400
00:11:47,332 --> 00:11:48,333
I'll come with you.

401
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:50,293
Honey, we want you to be here.

402
00:11:50,335 --> 00:11:52,587
You need to decompress and
take some time to yourself

403
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:54,047
to get over the
breakup with David.

404
00:11:54,089 --> 00:11:54,631
Dan.

405
00:11:54,673 --> 00:11:56,341
Dan, right.

406
00:11:56,383 --> 00:11:58,569
Now, what better way than to
do it right here at the home

407
00:11:58,593 --> 00:11:59,886
that you grew up in?

408
00:11:59,928 --> 00:12:01,197
Yeah, but this isn't
home without you two.

409
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:02,931
Sweetie, I know it's
hard, but you'll

410
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:04,307
have everything here you need.

411
00:12:04,349 --> 00:12:05,451
What about the neighborhood?

412
00:12:05,475 --> 00:12:07,060
The neighborhood needs you.

413
00:12:07,102 --> 00:12:10,063
You guys created the HOA
rules for Christmas after all.

414
00:12:10,105 --> 00:12:13,316
You can't just move to Florida
and leave everything behind.

415
00:12:13,358 --> 00:12:14,984
That is ridiculous.

416
00:12:15,026 --> 00:12:16,420
Your mother and I believe
that Florida is the place that

417
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:18,196
needs us the most.

418
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:21,908
Some lucky HOA has a hurricane
of Christmas coming their way.

419
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:23,493
They won't know what hit them.

420
00:12:24,536 --> 00:12:25,787
Well, that's for certain.

421
00:12:25,829 --> 00:12:27,205
Oh, come on, honey.

422
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:28,623
Do it for us.

423
00:12:28,665 --> 00:12:30,142
It would mean so much
to us if we knew you

424
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:31,710
were taking care of the house.

425
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:33,586
And we didn't want to
let the neighbors down.

426
00:12:33,628 --> 00:12:35,046
She's right.

427
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:37,257
Just think of it as your
Christmas present to us.

428
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:38,675
Fine.

429
00:12:38,717 --> 00:12:40,069
Just promise me you'll
be back by New Year's.

430
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:40,719
Oh, honey.

431
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,261
You have our word.

432
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:41,845
Oh.

433
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:43,555
OK, come on.

434
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:45,074
OK, try to enjoy one last
Christmas in the neighborhood.

435
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:46,325
Oh, I thought I told you
that's exactly what I

436
00:12:46,349 --> 00:12:47,600
was trying to avoid.

437
00:12:47,642 --> 00:12:48,518
It'll be just what
the doctor ordered.

438
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,769
Really?

439
00:12:49,811 --> 00:12:50,913
I think I'd like
a second opinion.

440
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:52,164
Hey, where are all
the decorations?

441
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:53,773
In the garage waiting for you.

442
00:12:53,815 --> 00:12:55,233
Yeah, but why
aren't they up yet?

443
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:56,776
We got a late start.

444
00:12:56,818 --> 00:12:57,444
Bye, honey.

445
00:12:57,485 --> 00:12:58,319
Have fun.

446
00:12:58,361 --> 00:13:00,989
Oh, almost forgot.

447
00:13:01,031 --> 00:13:02,031
See you.

448
00:13:12,167 --> 00:13:13,418
Hey!

449
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:14,753
You want to ride the lightning?

450
00:13:16,338 --> 00:13:17,380
No, I'm good.

451
00:13:17,422 --> 00:13:18,631
Party pooper.

452
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:26,806
Good evening, ma'am.

453
00:13:26,848 --> 00:13:28,433
My name is Jared Farnsworth.

454
00:13:28,475 --> 00:13:29,660
I'm looking for Emily Melrose.

455
00:13:29,684 --> 00:13:32,562
Is she here?

456
00:13:32,604 --> 00:13:34,522
I'm standing right here.

457
00:13:34,564 --> 00:13:35,815
No.

458
00:13:35,857 --> 00:13:37,126
Do you actually
not recognize me?

459
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:38,068
Well, see that's
impossible, because you do

460
00:13:38,109 --> 00:13:39,269
have her unforgettable smile.

461
00:13:40,695 --> 00:13:44,491
But, I mean, the Emily Melrose
I knew would be about, hmm,

462
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:47,952
to be 5'7 ", 5'8" by now.

463
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:49,579
You know what?

464
00:13:49,621 --> 00:13:51,849
It's really interesting,
because I recognize the freckles

465
00:13:51,873 --> 00:13:53,124
and the steel blue eyes.

466
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:54,542
But the Jared
Farnsworth I remember

467
00:13:54,584 --> 00:13:56,795
he had, oh, legs that were
as skinny as his arms.

468
00:13:56,836 --> 00:14:00,382
So you clearly can't beat him.

469
00:14:00,423 --> 00:14:01,174
You win.

470
00:14:01,216 --> 00:14:02,092
Welcome home.

471
00:14:02,133 --> 00:14:04,135
It's good to see you.

472
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:04,761
You too.

473
00:14:04,803 --> 00:14:06,096
Hey.

474
00:14:06,137 --> 00:14:07,555
So how did you know I was here?

475
00:14:07,597 --> 00:14:08,890
Well, that's the Evergreen way.

476
00:14:08,932 --> 00:14:10,493
See, all eyes have been
on you since you passed

477
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:11,476
the point of the mountain.

478
00:14:11,518 --> 00:14:12,602
Wait, really?

479
00:14:12,644 --> 00:14:13,728
I'll never tell.

480
00:14:14,396 --> 00:14:16,022
Oh, OK.

481
00:14:16,064 --> 00:14:17,607
So are you here
visiting your mom?

482
00:14:17,649 --> 00:14:19,192
I live here now,
just up the block.

483
00:14:19,234 --> 00:14:20,819
Oh, you have got to
tell me the truth.

484
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,529
How do you do it?

485
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:24,030
How do I do what?

486
00:14:24,072 --> 00:14:25,424
How do you deal with
everyone, including my parents

487
00:14:25,448 --> 00:14:27,426
being so over the top of
the whole Christmas thing?

488
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:28,910
Oh.

489
00:14:28,952 --> 00:14:29,911
Everyone is just so gung
ho with the decorations

490
00:14:29,953 --> 00:14:31,079
and the activities.

491
00:14:31,121 --> 00:14:33,039
And the HOA is so strict.

492
00:14:33,081 --> 00:14:35,875
To be honest, I love it.

493
00:14:35,917 --> 00:14:37,585
And your dad has been
such a mentor to me

494
00:14:37,627 --> 00:14:38,729
for my first year in office.

495
00:14:38,753 --> 00:14:40,338
Wait, office?

496
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:41,816
And I promise I'm not going
to let it go to my head.

497
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,442
But as a newly elected
president of the HOA,

498
00:14:43,466 --> 00:14:45,468
I want to formally
invite you to the kickoff

499
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:46,886
to the Christmas countdown.

500
00:14:46,928 --> 00:14:49,222
Is that the overly massive
tree lighting ceremony?

501
00:14:49,264 --> 00:14:49,806
Really?

502
00:14:49,848 --> 00:14:50,765
When's that?

503
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:52,058
Tonight.

504
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,202
Oh, it's a little
late in the season

505
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:54,602
to be lighting the
tree, isn't it?

506
00:14:54,644 --> 00:14:55,770
Christmas is in a week.

507
00:14:55,812 --> 00:14:57,522
Rest assured, I have my reasons.

508
00:14:57,564 --> 00:15:00,191
Oh, scheduling this many
board members is no easy feat.

509
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:02,152
In fact, I still don't
know how your dad did it

510
00:15:02,193 --> 00:15:06,531
with such perfect balance.

511
00:15:06,573 --> 00:15:07,532
Well.

512
00:15:07,574 --> 00:15:08,241
Anyway, can you come?

513
00:15:08,283 --> 00:15:09,159
You know what?

514
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,035
I just remembered I have plans.

515
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:10,785
I'm seeing Jess Woolley.

516
00:15:10,827 --> 00:15:11,494
You know her.

517
00:15:11,536 --> 00:15:12,620
Oh.

518
00:15:12,662 --> 00:15:13,955
She married Kevin Van Orden.

519
00:15:13,997 --> 00:15:15,599
And they have this
adorable little girl now.

520
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:17,101
Yeah, Jess, '80s retro, always
wears a beanie, cool mom.

521
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:18,585
That's oddly specific.

522
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:20,104
Oh, and her daughter loves
that Darla-Do-Good doll.

523
00:15:20,128 --> 00:15:21,463
All right, you're scaring me.

524
00:15:21,504 --> 00:15:22,464
How do you know all this?

525
00:15:22,505 --> 00:15:23,757
I call it the Santa sense.

526
00:15:23,798 --> 00:15:25,358
That and they're
heading up the walkway.

527
00:15:28,386 --> 00:15:28,762
Hi.

528
00:15:28,803 --> 00:15:29,512
Hi.

529
00:15:29,554 --> 00:15:30,263
Aunt Emily.

530
00:15:30,305 --> 00:15:30,764
You made it.

531
00:15:30,805 --> 00:15:31,431
Hey there.

532
00:15:31,473 --> 00:15:32,098
Come here.

533
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:32,682
Jared Farnsworth.

534
00:15:32,724 --> 00:15:33,266
Yeah.

535
00:15:33,308 --> 00:15:33,725
What?

536
00:15:33,767 --> 00:15:34,351
Oh.

537
00:15:34,392 --> 00:15:35,685
Oh, hey.

538
00:15:35,727 --> 00:15:36,436
Hi, Darla.

539
00:15:36,478 --> 00:15:37,771
Good to see you.

540
00:15:37,812 --> 00:15:39,105
What is going on here?

541
00:15:39,147 --> 00:15:40,541
Well, Emily just
informed me that you guys

542
00:15:40,565 --> 00:15:42,293
won't be able to attend the
Christmas tree lighting.

543
00:15:42,317 --> 00:15:43,276
I want to go.

544
00:15:43,318 --> 00:15:47,280
Yeah, so do I.

545
00:15:47,322 --> 00:15:49,824
Uh, OK, I guess we'll be
seeing you there after all.

546
00:15:49,866 --> 00:15:50,950
I sense that was coming.

547
00:15:50,992 --> 00:15:54,496
See you guys tonight.

548
00:15:54,537 --> 00:15:56,664
Is that an invitation
to the tree lighting?

549
00:15:56,706 --> 00:16:00,460
No, it's a notice for
insufficient Christmas decor.

550
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:03,129
What?

551
00:16:03,171 --> 00:16:05,006
Oh, Welcome back
to Evergreen Lane.

552
00:16:07,509 --> 00:16:09,844
I still can't believe you
live on Evergreen Lane.

553
00:16:09,886 --> 00:16:11,197
Well, I don't live here,
but I grew up here.

554
00:16:11,221 --> 00:16:12,657
Hey, are you sure
you're OK staying here

555
00:16:12,681 --> 00:16:14,808
by yourself? 'Cause you
can always crash with us.

556
00:16:14,849 --> 00:16:16,518
I'm fine.

557
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:18,204
Besides, my parents want me to
look after the house anyway.

558
00:16:18,228 --> 00:16:20,331
And I think it'll be good to
spend some time by myself.

559
00:16:20,355 --> 00:16:22,649
And try and figure out
why I spent the last three

560
00:16:22,691 --> 00:16:24,943
years of my life with Dan,
knowing that our relationship

561
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:26,277
had no future.

562
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:27,505
Because he was nice
at the beginning.

563
00:16:27,529 --> 00:16:28,988
But honestly, I
think the jerk in him

564
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:30,198
was just waiting to come out.

565
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,282
I know.

566
00:16:31,324 --> 00:16:32,283
You really dodged
a bullet there.

567
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:34,119
And yet, I still got wounded.

568
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,412
You know what I need?

569
00:16:35,453 --> 00:16:37,288
I need to just take
a bunch of hot baths.

570
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:39,374
I need to sleep until
10 o'clock every morning

571
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:41,835
and sit-in front of that
fireplace in my cozy pajamas

572
00:16:41,876 --> 00:16:43,545
and watch Christmas
movies on repeat.

573
00:16:43,586 --> 00:16:45,630
Yes, that sounds perfect.

574
00:16:45,672 --> 00:16:47,007
I think they're about to start.

575
00:16:47,048 --> 00:16:47,841
You guys want to go?

576
00:16:47,882 --> 00:16:48,882
Let's go.

577
00:16:51,636 --> 00:16:53,179
Emily Melrose?

578
00:16:53,221 --> 00:16:55,640
What a wonderful surprise.

579
00:16:55,682 --> 00:16:57,517
Hi, Belinda, Mary Louise, Bob.

580
00:16:57,559 --> 00:16:59,185
You guys remember my
best friend, Jess.

581
00:16:59,227 --> 00:17:00,287
And this is her
daughter, Nicole.

582
00:17:00,311 --> 00:17:01,187
Hi.

583
00:17:01,229 --> 00:17:02,022
We're so glad you could make it.

584
00:17:02,063 --> 00:17:03,189
Well, Jared invited us.

585
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:04,482
He's an architect.

586
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:05,567
And a darn good one.

587
00:17:05,608 --> 00:17:06,234
And handsome too.

588
00:17:06,276 --> 00:17:06,985
Uh-huh.

589
00:17:07,027 --> 00:17:08,611
Oh, stop, you two.

590
00:17:08,653 --> 00:17:10,715
The last thing Emily needs
is a couple of matchmakers.

591
00:17:10,739 --> 00:17:13,658
I thought she just got dumped
by that loser boyfriend of hers.

592
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,201
First of all, I dumped him, Bob.

593
00:17:15,243 --> 00:17:16,870
And second of all,
how did you hear that?

594
00:17:16,911 --> 00:17:18,246
Belinda, of course.

595
00:17:18,288 --> 00:17:20,373
She always spills the tea.

596
00:17:20,415 --> 00:17:21,624
I'm so sorry.

597
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:23,877
Your mother made it seem
like it wasn't a secret.

598
00:17:23,918 --> 00:17:25,462
Oh, that checks out.

599
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:26,004
You know what?

600
00:17:26,046 --> 00:17:27,047
She's right.

601
00:17:27,088 --> 00:17:28,548
I don't have anything to hide.

602
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:30,401
But I do want to just fly
a little under the radar

603
00:17:30,425 --> 00:17:31,968
this Christmas if
you know what I mean.

604
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:33,386
Good luck with that.

605
00:17:33,428 --> 00:17:35,680
Oh, well, we'll see
you at the tree.

606
00:17:35,722 --> 00:17:36,722
Mm-hmm.

607
00:17:36,848 --> 00:17:37,766
Come on.

608
00:17:37,807 --> 00:17:38,807
Let's go see that tree.

609
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,692
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome.

610
00:17:47,734 --> 00:17:49,444
It is December.

611
00:17:49,486 --> 00:17:52,405
And as you all know, we gather
to light the neighborhood tree.

612
00:17:52,447 --> 00:17:55,992
And I am very sorry to say that
we're a little late this year.

613
00:17:56,034 --> 00:17:56,743
A little?

614
00:17:56,785 --> 00:17:57,827
Couple of weeks.

615
00:17:57,869 --> 00:17:59,162
Stop it.

616
00:17:59,204 --> 00:18:00,497
We talked about this, Ned.

617
00:18:00,538 --> 00:18:02,040
It was the best
time for everyone.

618
00:18:02,082 --> 00:18:03,375
So thank you for that.

619
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:04,518
I've been free for
the last two weeks.

620
00:18:04,542 --> 00:18:06,252
You've been free
since the '80s, OK?

621
00:18:06,294 --> 00:18:07,462
Go ahead, Jared, please.

622
00:18:07,504 --> 00:18:09,130
Anyway, I want to
thank all of you

623
00:18:09,172 --> 00:18:11,966
for your efforts,
your energy this year.

624
00:18:12,008 --> 00:18:13,593
One announcement
that I have to make,

625
00:18:13,635 --> 00:18:16,262
though, is it's the first time
in the history of the HOA's

626
00:18:16,304 --> 00:18:20,433
30-year existence we will not
see Gail and Albert Melrose.

627
00:18:20,475 --> 00:18:21,935
Aww.

628
00:18:21,976 --> 00:18:24,354
But their daughter Emily has
come home for the holidays.

629
00:18:24,396 --> 00:18:25,730
So everyone say hi to Emily.

630
00:18:29,567 --> 00:18:32,028
Oh, reminds me...
Quick announcement,

631
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:34,322
there will be an HOA
meeting at 8:00 AM.

632
00:18:34,364 --> 00:18:35,657
Can you fill in for your folks?

633
00:18:35,699 --> 00:18:36,074
What?

634
00:18:36,116 --> 00:18:36,950
Me?

635
00:18:36,991 --> 00:18:39,994
We'll call at 7:45.

636
00:18:40,036 --> 00:18:40,787
Yeah.

637
00:18:40,829 --> 00:18:41,996
OK, yeah, yeah.

638
00:18:42,038 --> 00:18:43,289
Perfect.

639
00:18:43,331 --> 00:18:44,558
Emily Melrose,
ladies and gentlemen.

640
00:18:44,582 --> 00:18:45,291
Lovely.

641
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:46,751
So much for sleeping in.

642
00:18:46,793 --> 00:18:47,793
All right, everybody.

643
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:49,504
You know what this is.

644
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:56,469
Without further
ado, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1!

645
00:18:56,511 --> 00:18:57,846
Light her up.

646
00:18:57,887 --> 00:18:58,471
Oh.

647
00:18:58,513 --> 00:18:59,848
Oh.

648
00:18:59,889 --> 00:19:02,559
Jared, come on.

649
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,226
No, no.

650
00:19:03,268 --> 00:19:04,144
Is it broken?

651
00:19:04,185 --> 00:19:05,145
Ned, you said this worked.

652
00:19:05,186 --> 00:19:06,646
It worked when I did it.

653
00:19:06,688 --> 00:19:08,148
OK.

654
00:19:08,189 --> 00:19:10,108
Ned, let it... it's going
to be fine, everybody.

655
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:11,026
I'm sure it'll be fine.

656
00:19:11,067 --> 00:19:11,735
It's not going to work.

657
00:19:11,776 --> 00:19:12,360
Let's not...

658
00:19:12,402 --> 00:19:13,402
Come on.

659
00:19:14,362 --> 00:19:15,280
You know, this
never happened when

660
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:16,489
your parents were in charge.

661
00:19:16,531 --> 00:19:18,658
I don't want to
blame you but I am.

662
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:19,659
Give it.

663
00:19:19,701 --> 00:19:20,076
Oh.

664
00:19:20,118 --> 00:19:20,618
Ah.

665
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:21,036
Oh.

666
00:19:21,077 --> 00:19:22,077
Yeah!

667
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:31,671
Evergreen Lane,
I love Christmas!

668
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:36,634
Whoo!

669
00:19:36,676 --> 00:19:38,053
Yes.

670
00:19:48,563 --> 00:19:50,940
No one makes them fast as I can.

671
00:19:50,982 --> 00:19:56,237
First, the
head and then the shoulders.

672
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:03,660
What?

673
00:20:05,997 --> 00:20:08,958
Ugh.

674
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,418
Oh.

675
00:20:20,929 --> 00:20:21,929
What?

676
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:27,559
Oh.

677
00:20:31,981 --> 00:20:32,981
Hm.

678
00:20:40,407 --> 00:20:42,409
Hi, 911, yes.

679
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:44,994
I'd like to report a very
strange man wandering

680
00:20:45,036 --> 00:20:46,036
around my property.

681
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:49,833
Oh, I'm not strange.

682
00:20:49,874 --> 00:20:51,668
And you're not on
the phone with 911.

683
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:54,150
No, but I will be if you don't
tell me what you're doing here.

684
00:20:57,632 --> 00:20:59,175
I'm just checking
out some stuff.

685
00:20:59,217 --> 00:21:00,301
What kind of stuff?

686
00:21:00,343 --> 00:21:01,219
HOA Stuff?

687
00:21:01,261 --> 00:21:02,679
Yeah, how'd you guess?

688
00:21:02,721 --> 00:21:03,781
Because my dad used to
sneak around people's

689
00:21:03,805 --> 00:21:05,181
houses looking for
violations too.

690
00:21:05,223 --> 00:21:06,891
Such a legend.

691
00:21:06,933 --> 00:21:08,619
What does the HOA think about
noise levels in the morning?

692
00:21:08,643 --> 00:21:10,311
Actually, we have a
very strict policy,

693
00:21:10,353 --> 00:21:12,188
nothing above 90
decibels before 9:00 AM.

694
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:13,690
OK, so it's 7:30.

695
00:21:13,732 --> 00:21:15,942
Oh, every week except the
week before Christmas.

696
00:21:15,984 --> 00:21:17,569
Oh, well, that figures.

697
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:18,796
All right, so what'd you find?

698
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:20,131
Everything is very
detailed on that

699
00:21:20,155 --> 00:21:21,698
notice I left you last night.

700
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:23,867
You mean the notice that
was intended for my parents

701
00:21:23,908 --> 00:21:25,285
to handle?

702
00:21:25,326 --> 00:21:26,387
They're out of town, so
everything falls on you.

703
00:21:26,411 --> 00:21:28,538
Jared, are you serious?

704
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:31,249
By law 25.12, if
the owners are not

705
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:32,792
present or otherwise
incapacitated,

706
00:21:32,834 --> 00:21:34,669
they may nominate a
surrogate or next of kin

707
00:21:34,711 --> 00:21:36,463
to fulfill all
holiday obligations.

708
00:21:36,504 --> 00:21:37,523
Read up on that, buttercup.

709
00:21:37,547 --> 00:21:38,590
This one's for you.

710
00:21:38,631 --> 00:21:40,091
OK, now see, that's the thing.

711
00:21:40,133 --> 00:21:43,636
I came here to get away from
any and all obligations.

712
00:21:43,678 --> 00:21:45,055
That puts me in
quite the pickle.

713
00:21:45,096 --> 00:21:47,265
See, everyone
takes Christmas very, very

714
00:21:47,307 --> 00:21:48,558
seriously around here.

715
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,994
Maybe you can tell
them at the meeting,

716
00:21:50,018 --> 00:21:54,647
because I told them you
would be there so, yeah.

717
00:21:54,689 --> 00:21:57,442
Because I was pressured to say
yes in front of the whole town.

718
00:21:57,484 --> 00:21:59,736
Not cool!

719
00:21:59,778 --> 00:22:03,156
Emily, Emily.

720
00:22:03,198 --> 00:22:04,866
Emily, wait, I'm sorry.

721
00:22:04,908 --> 00:22:05,700
You're right.

722
00:22:05,742 --> 00:22:06,618
I shouldn't have done that.

723
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:07,702
Can we just talk about it?

724
00:22:07,744 --> 00:22:09,037
What do you mean talk about it?

725
00:22:09,079 --> 00:22:10,264
That thing that two
people do when they

726
00:22:10,288 --> 00:22:10,747
want to solve a problem, right?

727
00:22:10,789 --> 00:22:11,289
OK.

728
00:22:11,331 --> 00:22:11,956
You know what?

729
00:22:11,998 --> 00:22:12,874
Great.

730
00:22:12,916 --> 00:22:14,292
Let's talk about it.

731
00:22:14,334 --> 00:22:15,770
I think Christmas should
be about having fun.

732
00:22:15,794 --> 00:22:17,647
I don't think it should be
about attending HOA meetings

733
00:22:17,671 --> 00:22:18,922
or writing citations.

734
00:22:18,963 --> 00:22:21,925
In fact, I think the
word bylaw itself

735
00:22:21,966 --> 00:22:25,303
should be banned for the
entire month of December.

736
00:22:25,345 --> 00:22:27,972
So can you please
just let me enjoy

737
00:22:28,014 --> 00:22:29,391
the holiday in my own way?

738
00:22:29,432 --> 00:22:32,310
You're right.

739
00:22:32,352 --> 00:22:33,228
You're right.

740
00:22:33,269 --> 00:22:34,896
It's Christmas time.

741
00:22:34,938 --> 00:22:37,357
It's hardly the time to think
about the wants and needs

742
00:22:37,399 --> 00:22:38,399
of others.

743
00:22:42,445 --> 00:22:44,614
On the first day of Christmas,

744
00:22:44,656 --> 00:22:49,577
my true love gave to me a
partridge in a pear tree.

745
00:22:49,619 --> 00:22:51,037
Could you just go away?

746
00:22:51,079 --> 00:22:52,997
There is no bylaw against
early caroling here

747
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:53,998
on Evergreen Lane.

748
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,291
In fact, it's encouraged.

749
00:22:55,333 --> 00:22:56,811
Well, can you make
an exception, please?

750
00:22:56,835 --> 00:22:59,295
On the second day of Christmas,

751
00:22:59,337 --> 00:23:05,176
my true love gave to me two
turtle doves and a partridge

752
00:23:05,218 --> 00:23:06,886
in a pear tree.

753
00:23:06,928 --> 00:23:10,056
On the third day of
Christmas, my true love

754
00:23:10,098 --> 00:23:15,145
gave to me three French
hens, two turtle doves,

755
00:23:15,186 --> 00:23:17,355
and a partridge in...

756
00:23:20,358 --> 00:23:21,651
Fine, you win.

757
00:23:21,693 --> 00:23:23,820
I'll go to the
meeting if you promise

758
00:23:23,862 --> 00:23:26,489
to not sing that song
for the rest of the week

759
00:23:26,531 --> 00:23:28,074
or the rest of my life ever.

760
00:23:28,116 --> 00:23:29,492
OK.

761
00:23:41,171 --> 00:23:44,215
So the word on the
street is you're an architect.

762
00:23:44,257 --> 00:23:45,508
That's right.

763
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:46,718
What kind?

764
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,094
House remodels mostly.

765
00:23:48,136 --> 00:23:49,637
Did you remodel your house?

766
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:52,432
I did for absolute
optimal holiday cheer.

767
00:23:52,474 --> 00:23:54,351
You can put in an
extra wide fireplace.

768
00:23:54,392 --> 00:23:56,186
Why extra wide?

769
00:23:56,227 --> 00:23:58,021
Santa, of course.

770
00:23:59,022 --> 00:23:59,981
Hm.

771
00:24:00,023 --> 00:24:00,857
What do you do?

772
00:24:00,899 --> 00:24:02,942
I am a freelance copy editor.

773
00:24:02,984 --> 00:24:03,818
That makes sense.

774
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:05,195
You were always a great writer.

775
00:24:05,236 --> 00:24:07,030
In fact, do you
remember in fifth grade?

776
00:24:07,072 --> 00:24:09,491
You wrote a story about a little
girl who asked Santa for it

777
00:24:09,532 --> 00:24:11,034
to be Christmas every day.

778
00:24:11,076 --> 00:24:12,327
Wait, you remember that?

779
00:24:12,369 --> 00:24:15,747
Pick up the pace,
you lollygaggers!

780
00:24:15,789 --> 00:24:16,706
Come on.

781
00:24:16,748 --> 00:24:18,124
T-minus 2 minutes and counting.

782
00:24:18,166 --> 00:24:19,000
Let's do it.

783
00:24:19,042 --> 00:24:19,959
Let's do it.

784
00:24:20,001 --> 00:24:21,628
Let's do it.

785
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:23,296
Got to love his enthusiasm.

786
00:24:23,338 --> 00:24:27,050
Yeah, his aim isn't bad either.

787
00:24:27,092 --> 00:24:29,803
Let's just, um...

788
00:24:29,844 --> 00:24:31,554
All right, team, listen up.

789
00:24:31,596 --> 00:24:33,723
We have six days
until Christmas.

790
00:24:33,765 --> 00:24:35,892
And as you can see, lots
of fun still to have.

791
00:24:35,934 --> 00:24:38,019
Now, I just want to make
sure our event managers are

792
00:24:38,061 --> 00:24:39,646
up to speed on what
they need to do.

793
00:24:39,688 --> 00:24:42,065
Now first off, let's see,
Christmas Cookie Contest

794
00:24:42,107 --> 00:24:42,524
this afternoon.

795
00:24:42,565 --> 00:24:43,191
Check.

796
00:24:43,233 --> 00:24:43,900
Check.

797
00:24:43,942 --> 00:24:45,068
Thank you, Mom.

798
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:46,170
Hot chocolate prepped
for the visitors.

799
00:24:46,194 --> 00:24:47,028
You know this.

800
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:48,196
Mm.

801
00:24:48,238 --> 00:24:49,114
Trophy for the winner.

802
00:24:49,155 --> 00:24:50,657
Locked and loaded.

803
00:24:50,699 --> 00:24:53,076
But I don't know why we don't
just give it to her now?

804
00:24:53,118 --> 00:24:54,244
Don't be hasty, Ned.

805
00:24:54,285 --> 00:24:56,204
It's anyone's game.

806
00:24:56,246 --> 00:24:59,499
Lastly, we have the illustrious
Snowman Tableau Now, we

807
00:24:59,541 --> 00:25:01,459
know that Gail and Albert
are down in Florida.

808
00:25:01,501 --> 00:25:03,211
So we may need someone
to fill-in for them.

809
00:25:03,253 --> 00:25:04,504
Why don't we have Emily do it?

810
00:25:04,546 --> 00:25:06,256
That way it can
stay in the family.

811
00:25:06,297 --> 00:25:07,757
Oh, now that's a wonderful idea.

812
00:25:07,799 --> 00:25:08,717
No, no, no, no, no, no.

813
00:25:08,758 --> 00:25:09,801
Well, hold on.

814
00:25:09,843 --> 00:25:10,760
Let's see what Emily has to say.

815
00:25:10,802 --> 00:25:11,845
Emily, what do you think?

816
00:25:11,886 --> 00:25:13,221
I'm just a little confused.

817
00:25:13,263 --> 00:25:16,349
It's an exhibition of
frozen humanity followed

818
00:25:16,391 --> 00:25:17,684
by a no-rules snowball fight.

819
00:25:17,726 --> 00:25:19,144
What's to explain?

820
00:25:19,185 --> 00:25:20,945
No, I'm well aware of
what the event entails.

821
00:25:20,979 --> 00:25:23,440
I still have slight hearing
loss from the time I took

822
00:25:23,481 --> 00:25:25,316
a shot to the eardrum in 2012.

823
00:25:25,358 --> 00:25:26,818
You said you forgave me.

824
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:27,736
Say it louder, Ned.

825
00:25:27,777 --> 00:25:28,611
That might be the ear.

826
00:25:28,653 --> 00:25:30,238
You said you forgave me!

827
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:32,073
Right.

828
00:25:32,115 --> 00:25:34,135
What I'm confused about is why
my parents didn't find someone

829
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:36,369
to cover this if they knew
they were going out of town?

830
00:25:36,411 --> 00:25:37,411
Yeah, well, uh...

831
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:39,080
Why...

832
00:25:39,122 --> 00:25:40,248
You know what?

833
00:25:40,290 --> 00:25:41,642
I'm sure they could
walk you through it.

834
00:25:41,666 --> 00:25:42,584
You have plenty of time.

835
00:25:42,625 --> 00:25:43,293
How much?

836
00:25:43,335 --> 00:25:44,127
36 hours.

837
00:25:44,169 --> 00:25:45,170
Plenty of time?

838
00:25:45,211 --> 00:25:46,671
That sounds like
slight hyperbole.

839
00:25:46,713 --> 00:25:48,298
You do have to enter
the cookie contest.

840
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:50,484
And your house still need to
be decorated to code, so yeah.

841
00:25:50,508 --> 00:25:51,801
Yeah, maybe you're right.

842
00:25:51,843 --> 00:25:54,387
I actually don't have
to do any of this.

843
00:25:55,472 --> 00:25:56,014
Oh.

844
00:25:56,056 --> 00:25:57,307
OK.

845
00:25:57,349 --> 00:26:00,852
Is it me or did it just
get really hot in here?

846
00:26:00,894 --> 00:26:04,356
We don't want you to miss
out on any of the fun, Emily.

847
00:26:04,397 --> 00:26:05,815
Wait a minute.

848
00:26:05,857 --> 00:26:10,862
Why don't Pamela and
Emily co-manage the event?

849
00:26:12,322 --> 00:26:13,323
You know what?

850
00:26:13,365 --> 00:26:14,532
I'll just do it by myself.

851
00:26:14,574 --> 00:26:15,658
That'll be so much easier.

852
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:17,202
Oh, I'm totally fine with that.

853
00:26:17,243 --> 00:26:17,994
That's a great idea.

854
00:26:18,036 --> 00:26:19,829
Great.

855
00:26:19,871 --> 00:26:21,223
No, then Emily wouldn't have the
satisfaction of participating.

856
00:26:21,247 --> 00:26:23,375
I think co-managers
is a great idea.

857
00:26:23,416 --> 00:26:30,173
I feel like I finally know
what the FOMO feels like.

858
00:26:30,215 --> 00:26:31,424
Hah.

859
00:26:31,466 --> 00:26:32,652
You guys are going
to have a blast.

860
00:26:32,676 --> 00:26:33,510
You know what?

861
00:26:33,551 --> 00:26:34,719
Can you define FOMO?

862
00:26:34,761 --> 00:26:37,847
Fear of making out.

863
00:26:37,889 --> 00:26:38,973
Sorry about that, Bob.

864
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:45,230
Oh, please let it
be the one where

865
00:26:45,271 --> 00:26:47,899
she finds out her boyfriend
is actually a prince.

866
00:26:54,406 --> 00:26:55,365
Hi, Mom.

867
00:26:55,407 --> 00:26:56,241
Hi, sweetie.

868
00:26:56,282 --> 00:26:57,492
Hi, sweetie.

869
00:26:57,534 --> 00:26:58,594
Are you guys on a golf cart?

870
00:26:58,618 --> 00:26:59,869
Your father's driving.

871
00:26:59,911 --> 00:27:00,870
We're between holes.

872
00:27:00,912 --> 00:27:01,955
Oh, who's winning?

873
00:27:01,996 --> 00:27:03,665
I don't want to talk about it.

874
00:27:03,707 --> 00:27:04,582
How are you?

875
00:27:04,624 --> 00:27:06,376
I'm OK.

876
00:27:06,418 --> 00:27:07,853
But why didn't you
tell the HOA to have someone

877
00:27:07,877 --> 00:27:09,170
else run the Snowman Tableau?

878
00:27:09,212 --> 00:27:09,546
Uh.

879
00:27:09,587 --> 00:27:10,547
No.

880
00:27:10,588 --> 00:27:11,631
It must've slip mind.

881
00:27:11,673 --> 00:27:12,173
Fell through the
cracks, I guess.

882
00:27:12,215 --> 00:27:13,133
Uh-huh.

883
00:27:13,174 --> 00:27:14,634
Well, they've assigned it to me.

884
00:27:14,676 --> 00:27:15,736
And they also want me to
decorate the house and bake

885
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,012
cookies.

886
00:27:17,053 --> 00:27:18,805
That sounds like a
perfect Christmas.

887
00:27:18,847 --> 00:27:20,390
Yeah, maybe in some
alternate universe

888
00:27:20,432 --> 00:27:22,809
where I wasn't ditched by my
parents for the Sunshine State.

889
00:27:22,851 --> 00:27:24,185
Oh, come on, honey.

890
00:27:24,227 --> 00:27:25,621
It sounds so harsh when
you say it like that.

891
00:27:25,645 --> 00:27:26,855
Well, how do you think I feel?

892
00:27:26,896 --> 00:27:28,440
I feel like I'm
in Home Alone 4...

893
00:27:28,481 --> 00:27:29,607
Stuck in the Suburbs.

894
00:27:29,649 --> 00:27:31,151
Don't be so dramatic.

895
00:27:31,192 --> 00:27:33,028
I'm sorry about the decorating.

896
00:27:33,069 --> 00:27:35,196
But you did say you
wanted to bake cookies.

897
00:27:35,238 --> 00:27:37,824
No, I said I wanted to
eat cookies a lot of them.

898
00:27:37,866 --> 00:27:39,576
Then make extra.

899
00:27:39,617 --> 00:27:42,871
Please, Emily, at least try to
get a baseline of decorations

900
00:27:42,912 --> 00:27:44,205
up at the house.

901
00:27:44,247 --> 00:27:45,874
Our family has a
reputation to uphold.

902
00:27:45,915 --> 00:27:47,334
All right, fine.

903
00:27:47,375 --> 00:27:48,251
I'll do it.

904
00:27:48,293 --> 00:27:49,711
I'll do my best for you guys.

905
00:27:49,753 --> 00:27:51,254
There's my girl.

906
00:27:51,296 --> 00:27:52,898
All right, I'm just a
little worried that my best

907
00:27:52,922 --> 00:27:53,715
is not going to be up to par.

908
00:27:53,757 --> 00:27:55,050
Don't worry.

909
00:27:55,091 --> 00:27:55,717
Neither is your
father's golf score.

910
00:27:55,759 --> 00:27:56,468
Ooh.

911
00:27:56,509 --> 00:27:57,886
I told you.

912
00:27:57,927 --> 00:27:58,511
I will turn it around
on the back nine.

913
00:27:58,553 --> 00:27:59,596
Sure you will.

914
00:27:59,637 --> 00:28:00,472
That's what you said yesterday.

915
00:28:00,513 --> 00:28:01,389
We agreed, no put down.

916
00:28:01,431 --> 00:28:02,182
You guys, I need help.

917
00:28:02,223 --> 00:28:02,849
Remember?

918
00:28:02,891 --> 00:28:03,892
Me, help, please.

919
00:28:03,933 --> 00:28:05,352
There's a checklist on my desk.

920
00:28:05,393 --> 00:28:07,020
That should get
you right on track.

921
00:28:07,062 --> 00:28:07,896
Have fun, honey.

922
00:28:07,937 --> 00:28:08,730
Don't you dare go first.

923
00:28:08,772 --> 00:28:09,647
Goodbye.

924
00:28:09,689 --> 00:28:10,523
I am the wolf, still.

925
00:28:10,565 --> 00:28:11,399
Wolf "schmolf."

926
00:28:11,441 --> 00:28:12,441
Come on.

927
00:28:14,527 --> 00:28:15,779
Oh, goodness.

928
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:18,531
Oh, it's the one in Vienna.

929
00:28:18,573 --> 00:28:21,368
I love this guy.

930
00:28:31,127 --> 00:28:31,920
Hold up.

931
00:28:31,961 --> 00:28:33,505
Is this another warning?

932
00:28:33,546 --> 00:28:35,048
No, absolutely not.

933
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:36,591
It's not a warning.

934
00:28:36,633 --> 00:28:37,717
That's a full-on citation.

935
00:28:37,759 --> 00:28:38,843
For what?

936
00:28:38,885 --> 00:28:40,112
Violation of the
nutcracker code.

937
00:28:40,136 --> 00:28:42,263
It's in your handbook,
section 1-5904.

938
00:28:42,305 --> 00:28:43,181
Oh, yeah.

939
00:28:43,223 --> 00:28:45,058
I must have skimmed that part.

940
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:47,018
Every front porch
must have a nutcracker

941
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:49,020
by December 19th,
which was yesterday.

942
00:28:49,062 --> 00:28:50,939
And I'm giving you a
bit of wiggle room here.

943
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:52,375
And I don't want to say
it's getting ridiculous.

944
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:54,168
OK, I didn't even know
about the nutcracker code.

945
00:28:54,192 --> 00:28:57,487
It's in your handbook.

946
00:28:57,529 --> 00:28:58,780
One second.

947
00:28:58,822 --> 00:28:59,781
I'll wait.

948
00:28:59,823 --> 00:29:02,200
Yeah, just a sec.

949
00:29:08,415 --> 00:29:09,874
Are we good?

950
00:29:09,916 --> 00:29:16,297
It is illegal
to rip up a citation.

951
00:29:16,339 --> 00:29:18,675
Also, your nutcracker needs
to be 36 inches from shoe

952
00:29:18,717 --> 00:29:19,718
to chapeau.

953
00:29:19,759 --> 00:29:20,677
Oh, from shoe to chapeau.

954
00:29:20,719 --> 00:29:21,821
Is that in the handbook too?

955
00:29:21,845 --> 00:29:24,806
No, it's my own little flourish.

956
00:29:24,848 --> 00:29:26,266
OK.

957
00:29:26,307 --> 00:29:28,143
So what is the penalty
for these citations?

958
00:29:28,184 --> 00:29:30,270
That's up to the HOA
president. Me.

959
00:29:30,311 --> 00:29:31,980
And should be proportional
to the offense.

960
00:29:32,022 --> 00:29:33,398
So what do I get
for no nutcracker?

961
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,108
Well, that's known
as a fix-it ticket.

962
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:37,318
And you get a taller nutcracker,
and I will personally

963
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:38,486
tear that up.

964
00:29:38,528 --> 00:29:39,839
And what about the
one that I ripped up?

965
00:29:39,863 --> 00:29:41,489
About two hours
community service.

966
00:29:41,531 --> 00:29:43,217
You can start by helping Mary
Louise and Bob with their lawn

967
00:29:43,241 --> 00:29:44,241
display.

968
00:29:47,078 --> 00:29:48,078
Hey there, Bob.

969
00:29:51,207 --> 00:29:52,584
OK.

970
00:29:52,625 --> 00:29:54,085
All righty then.

971
00:30:02,135 --> 00:30:05,472
So what was wrong with this
spot for Dasher and Dancer?

972
00:30:05,513 --> 00:30:06,348
Oh, nothing.

973
00:30:06,389 --> 00:30:07,891
I just wanted a second opinion.

974
00:30:07,932 --> 00:30:09,309
Oh, OK.

975
00:30:09,351 --> 00:30:10,828
Well, would it be
all right if I maybe

976
00:30:10,852 --> 00:30:12,663
take down the rest of the
reindeer in the meantime?

977
00:30:12,687 --> 00:30:15,124
Well, if Dasher and Dancer move,
everything's going to change.

978
00:30:15,148 --> 00:30:15,899
Oh, excellent point.

979
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:16,524
Well...

980
00:30:16,566 --> 00:30:17,650
OK.

981
00:30:17,692 --> 00:30:19,194
The cookies are in the oven.

982
00:30:19,235 --> 00:30:21,112
And where were we, Bob?

983
00:30:21,154 --> 00:30:22,364
Oh, Dasher and Dancer.

984
00:30:23,531 --> 00:30:25,617
Oh, OK, honey, a
little to the right.

985
00:30:25,658 --> 00:30:26,701
OK.

986
00:30:26,743 --> 00:30:28,036
OK, and a little forward.

987
00:30:28,078 --> 00:30:30,372
Yeah, and then a
little to the right.

988
00:30:30,413 --> 00:30:31,247
Yeah.

989
00:30:31,289 --> 00:30:32,499
And now to the left.

990
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:33,583
OK.

991
00:30:33,625 --> 00:30:34,501
To the left, to the left.

992
00:30:34,542 --> 00:30:35,752
Oh, boy.

993
00:30:35,794 --> 00:30:36,711
To the left.

994
00:30:36,753 --> 00:30:38,546
Sorry, just a sec.

995
00:30:38,588 --> 00:30:39,798
Whoa.

996
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:41,383
What do you think, Bob?

997
00:30:41,424 --> 00:30:43,385
About what?

998
00:30:43,426 --> 00:30:45,220
Pfft, pfft.

999
00:30:45,261 --> 00:30:50,016
Well, what do you think?

1000
00:30:50,058 --> 00:30:52,977
Oh, it's perfect.

1001
00:30:53,019 --> 00:30:53,978
Thank you.

1002
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:55,397
Aww, happy to help.

1003
00:30:55,438 --> 00:30:56,898
Really?

1004
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:58,959
Oh, I thought Jared cited
you with community service.

1005
00:30:58,983 --> 00:31:00,610
True but you know what?

1006
00:31:00,652 --> 00:31:01,319
It was a pleasure.

1007
00:31:01,361 --> 00:31:03,071
We'll thank Jared later.

1008
00:31:03,113 --> 00:31:04,322
He's an architect, you know.

1009
00:31:04,364 --> 00:31:05,824
That has been mentioned, yes.

1010
00:31:05,865 --> 00:31:07,617
Mm-hmm.

1011
00:31:07,659 --> 00:31:09,178
And you let us know if you need
any help with your decorations.

1012
00:31:09,202 --> 00:31:10,036
Do you know what?

1013
00:31:10,078 --> 00:31:11,663
I have a question.

1014
00:31:11,705 --> 00:31:12,932
Did my parents were really
not put up any decorations?

1015
00:31:12,956 --> 00:31:14,082
Well, as a matter of fact...

1016
00:31:14,124 --> 00:31:16,751
Bob doesn't remember,
do you, Bob?

1017
00:31:16,793 --> 00:31:18,753
Um, yeah, she's right.

1018
00:31:18,795 --> 00:31:19,921
I don't remember.

1019
00:31:19,963 --> 00:31:21,047
Neither of us do.

1020
00:31:21,089 --> 00:31:22,340
OK, all right.

1021
00:31:22,382 --> 00:31:23,776
Well, I got to go
bake some cookies.

1022
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:26,636
So see you later.

1023
00:31:28,388 --> 00:31:30,098
Stop mentioning Jared.

1024
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:33,643
You're going to jinx it.

1025
00:31:33,685 --> 00:31:36,229
I can't believe we have less
than two hours to finish these.

1026
00:31:36,271 --> 00:31:38,440
I should have started this
before you guys came over.

1027
00:31:39,858 --> 00:31:40,984
Oh, what is it now?

1028
00:31:41,026 --> 00:31:41,943
Go on.

1029
00:31:41,985 --> 00:31:42,527
We can mix the batter.

1030
00:31:42,569 --> 00:31:44,029
OK.

1031
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:44,988
The sugar is right there
in the medium canister.

1032
00:31:45,030 --> 00:31:46,114
Got it.

1033
00:31:46,156 --> 00:31:47,073
Ready to make some cookies?

1034
00:31:47,115 --> 00:31:48,115
Yep.

1035
00:31:50,744 --> 00:31:52,162
Pamela, what's up?

1036
00:31:56,332 --> 00:31:58,376
I was wondering when
you'd like to meet

1037
00:31:58,418 --> 00:31:59,878
to plan the snowman parade.

1038
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:01,129
Right.

1039
00:32:01,171 --> 00:32:03,089
How about later tonight?

1040
00:32:03,131 --> 00:32:05,759
No, no.

1041
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:08,887
I never plan anything
after the cookie contest.

1042
00:32:08,928 --> 00:32:09,763
Oh, OK.

1043
00:32:09,804 --> 00:32:11,389
Why not?

1044
00:32:11,431 --> 00:32:13,117
If I lose, I will be in no
condition to do anything.

1045
00:32:13,141 --> 00:32:14,285
Good for you for being honest.

1046
00:32:14,309 --> 00:32:15,352
But I've never lost.

1047
00:32:15,393 --> 00:32:16,269
Right, no, of course.

1048
00:32:16,311 --> 00:32:18,605
OK, so if you win...

1049
00:32:18,646 --> 00:32:19,814
If.

1050
00:32:19,856 --> 00:32:20,774
If I win?

1051
00:32:20,815 --> 00:32:21,608
Sorry, sorry, sorry, no.

1052
00:32:21,649 --> 00:32:22,233
I mean, when...

1053
00:32:22,275 --> 00:32:23,568
OK, don't jinx me.

1054
00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:23,985
Right.

1055
00:32:24,027 --> 00:32:24,778
Shh.

1056
00:32:24,819 --> 00:32:25,362
Just... but I...

1057
00:32:25,403 --> 00:32:26,154
Please.

1058
00:32:26,196 --> 00:32:26,654
I was just going to...

1059
00:32:26,696 --> 00:32:28,031
Mmm.

1060
00:32:28,073 --> 00:32:29,342
How about when the
whole thing's over?

1061
00:32:29,366 --> 00:32:31,493
We'll just check in
with each other, right?

1062
00:32:31,534 --> 00:32:33,453
And we'll see if you're
in a happy place.

1063
00:32:33,495 --> 00:32:36,206
And if you are,
then we can meet up.

1064
00:32:36,247 --> 00:32:39,084
How does that sound?

1065
00:32:39,125 --> 00:32:41,127
That's fine.

1066
00:32:41,169 --> 00:32:43,672
OK, Whoo, good.

1067
00:32:43,713 --> 00:32:44,798
OK, I'll see you there.

1068
00:32:44,839 --> 00:32:45,839
Great.

1069
00:32:48,218 --> 00:32:49,844
Your nutcracker's too short!

1070
00:32:49,886 --> 00:32:50,886
I'm aware.

1071
00:32:53,723 --> 00:32:55,684
So what are you going
to do after the holiday?

1072
00:32:55,725 --> 00:32:57,352
I don't know.

1073
00:32:57,394 --> 00:32:58,871
I'll probably just camp out
here until I find a place.

1074
00:32:58,895 --> 00:33:01,064
I'm sure my parents would
love having me around.

1075
00:33:01,106 --> 00:33:03,942
Mm, well, so would a
certain HOA president.

1076
00:33:03,983 --> 00:33:04,859
What?

1077
00:33:04,901 --> 00:33:05,610
Oh, give me a break.

1078
00:33:05,652 --> 00:33:07,320
What?

1079
00:33:07,362 --> 00:33:08,547
I saw the way he was looking
at you at the tree lighting.

1080
00:33:08,571 --> 00:33:09,030
What?

1081
00:33:09,072 --> 00:33:10,490
Come on.

1082
00:33:10,532 --> 00:33:12,867
Like you were the only
woman on Evergreen Lane.

1083
00:33:12,909 --> 00:33:13,909
She's right.

1084
00:33:14,202 --> 00:33:16,204
I noticed it too.

1085
00:33:16,246 --> 00:33:19,040
Well, I didn't even
know you were listening.

1086
00:33:19,082 --> 00:33:21,167
She is always listening.

1087
00:33:32,804 --> 00:33:34,472
I'm out of my league.

1088
00:33:34,514 --> 00:33:36,325
How could it was going to be
"The Great British Bake Off"?

1089
00:33:36,349 --> 00:33:38,018
It's always this crazy.

1090
00:33:38,059 --> 00:33:39,328
These folks don't understand
the meaning of the word amateur.

1091
00:33:39,352 --> 00:33:40,395
Well, don't feel bad.

1092
00:33:40,437 --> 00:33:43,982
I am sure that these hold up.

1093
00:33:44,024 --> 00:33:44,858
Yuck.

1094
00:33:44,899 --> 00:33:46,234
Nicole.

1095
00:33:46,276 --> 00:33:48,820
I'm sure that it's fine.

1096
00:33:48,862 --> 00:33:50,405
Mm.

1097
00:33:50,447 --> 00:33:55,452
Are you sure it was sugar
from the medium cannister?

1098
00:33:55,493 --> 00:33:59,414
My mom doesn't label the jars.

1099
00:33:59,456 --> 00:34:00,749
Is that a Salt Lake specialty?

1100
00:34:02,125 --> 00:34:03,585
Aha.

1101
00:34:04,794 --> 00:34:06,588
The classic.

1102
00:34:06,629 --> 00:34:08,590
Did you know that
English shortbread

1103
00:34:08,631 --> 00:34:11,551
is the forerunner of the
modern American sugar cookie?

1104
00:34:11,593 --> 00:34:13,303
Yeah, there's
another school that

1105
00:34:13,345 --> 00:34:17,849
says it goes back to
Mesopotamia, 2000 years ago.

1106
00:34:17,891 --> 00:34:19,851
But I am not of that school.

1107
00:34:19,893 --> 00:34:23,271
This was originally
formulated in Sussex

1108
00:34:23,313 --> 00:34:25,273
by the chef de cuisine
of the Archduke of...

1109
00:34:25,315 --> 00:34:26,941
Sorry, are you allergic to nuts?

1110
00:34:26,983 --> 00:34:27,609
No.

1111
00:34:27,650 --> 00:34:27,984
Milk?

1112
00:34:28,026 --> 00:34:28,693
No.

1113
00:34:28,735 --> 00:34:29,110
Shellfish?

1114
00:34:29,152 --> 00:34:30,111
No.

1115
00:34:30,153 --> 00:34:30,945
What are you allergic to?

1116
00:34:30,987 --> 00:34:31,780
Sulfites.

1117
00:34:31,821 --> 00:34:33,406
Bummer.

1118
00:34:33,448 --> 00:34:35,367
Sulfites were the
secret ingredient.

1119
00:34:35,408 --> 00:34:36,493
And a lot of salt.

1120
00:34:36,534 --> 00:34:37,660
Nicole.

1121
00:34:42,499 --> 00:34:43,375
Oh.

1122
00:34:43,416 --> 00:34:44,751
Mom, can I have a real cookie?

1123
00:34:44,793 --> 00:34:46,002
Yes, please do.

1124
00:34:46,044 --> 00:34:47,337
You should.

1125
00:34:47,379 --> 00:34:49,381
Mm, divine.

1126
00:34:49,422 --> 00:34:50,715
Can I have a bite?

1127
00:34:50,757 --> 00:34:53,176
Thank you.

1128
00:35:04,187 --> 00:35:08,066
OK, you've all brought your
A-game, but the votes are in.

1129
00:35:08,108 --> 00:35:11,361
And I know it was hard to
choose a favorite from among so

1130
00:35:11,403 --> 00:35:13,029
many glorious recipes.

1131
00:35:13,071 --> 00:35:15,907
But we do have to crown a
winner for this year's Christmas

1132
00:35:15,949 --> 00:35:17,075
Cookie Contest.

1133
00:35:17,117 --> 00:35:18,368
Ring-a-ding-ding, baby.

1134
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:21,413
It's game time.

1135
00:35:21,454 --> 00:35:24,374
Third place goes
to Ned Broadhead.

1136
00:35:24,416 --> 00:35:25,416
Yeah, me!

1137
00:35:26,209 --> 00:35:27,127
Oh, me!

1138
00:35:27,168 --> 00:35:27,961
Oh!

1139
00:35:28,003 --> 00:35:29,587
I did it.

1140
00:35:29,629 --> 00:35:30,171
Yes.

1141
00:35:30,213 --> 00:35:31,423
I did it.

1142
00:35:31,464 --> 00:35:31,923
The third place,
that seems right.

1143
00:35:31,965 --> 00:35:33,258
Third.

1144
00:35:33,299 --> 00:35:35,093
Spicy gingersnaps
were a first for me.

1145
00:35:35,135 --> 00:35:36,428
What was the secret ingredient?

1146
00:35:36,469 --> 00:35:38,513
Nepalese ghost peppers, baby.

1147
00:35:38,555 --> 00:35:39,931
That'd do it.

1148
00:35:39,973 --> 00:35:41,975
All right, second place.

1149
00:35:42,017 --> 00:35:44,144
We never want second.

1150
00:35:44,185 --> 00:35:46,062
Missy Cartwright...

1151
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:50,567
for her sumptuous and
rich egg nog truffles.

1152
00:35:50,608 --> 00:35:54,612
But the winner, first
place, once again

1153
00:35:54,654 --> 00:35:59,242
for her perfect pecan
stockings is Pamela Bevans.

1154
00:36:01,077 --> 00:36:03,413
Oh, thank you.

1155
00:36:03,455 --> 00:36:07,375
Oh, my god.

1156
00:36:07,417 --> 00:36:09,461
Oh.

1157
00:36:09,502 --> 00:36:11,212
Would you like to
say a few words?

1158
00:36:11,254 --> 00:36:13,298
Me... I...

1159
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:15,467
Oh.

1160
00:36:15,508 --> 00:36:17,469
Let's keep hydrated, shall we?

1161
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:20,638
OK, thanks for coming, everyone.

1162
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:23,224
I hope you saved some
Christmas cookies for Santa,

1163
00:36:23,266 --> 00:36:25,852
because he'll be
here in six days!

1164
00:36:25,894 --> 00:36:26,894
Yes.

1165
00:36:29,272 --> 00:36:32,150
Sorry.

1166
00:36:32,192 --> 00:36:34,110
Ah!

1167
00:36:35,278 --> 00:36:36,438
Never see anything like that.

1168
00:36:36,988 --> 00:36:37,364
Oh, you should look.

1169
00:36:37,405 --> 00:36:38,239
Oh, wow.

1170
00:36:38,281 --> 00:36:39,366
Oh, wow.

1171
00:36:39,407 --> 00:36:40,033
I never stood a chance, did I?

1172
00:36:40,075 --> 00:36:41,493
No.

1173
00:36:41,534 --> 00:36:44,245
Whoa, hi... Pamela, hi.

1174
00:36:44,287 --> 00:36:45,163
Congratulations.

1175
00:36:45,205 --> 00:36:46,539
Thank you.

1176
00:36:46,581 --> 00:36:48,375
I am now prepared to
confirm our planning

1177
00:36:48,416 --> 00:36:49,459
meeting for later today.

1178
00:36:49,501 --> 00:36:50,835
Oh, good.

1179
00:36:50,877 --> 00:36:52,063
Are you sure you're
OK though, because you

1180
00:36:52,087 --> 00:36:53,463
seemed kind of emotional.

1181
00:36:53,505 --> 00:36:54,940
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

1182
00:36:54,964 --> 00:36:57,133
Besides, victory
gives me purpose.

1183
00:36:57,175 --> 00:36:58,343
OK, then.

1184
00:36:58,385 --> 00:36:59,469
All right, how about...

1185
00:36:59,511 --> 00:37:00,804
I don't know.

1186
00:37:00,845 --> 00:37:02,389
What time works for
you this evening.

1187
00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:04,283
Well, I feel it's best to
take advantage of the daylight

1188
00:37:04,307 --> 00:37:05,558
hours.

1189
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:06,619
We don't want to
appear like a couple

1190
00:37:06,643 --> 00:37:08,269
of lackadaisical Leslies, do we?

1191
00:37:08,311 --> 00:37:09,562
Oh, quite the contrary.

1192
00:37:09,604 --> 00:37:11,189
You know, I had some
Christmas stuff,

1193
00:37:11,231 --> 00:37:13,191
that I was going to do
Christmas activities.

1194
00:37:13,233 --> 00:37:17,028
But why don't we
say around 4:00?

1195
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:21,783
OK, I'll put around
4:00 in my calendar.

1196
00:37:21,825 --> 00:37:23,868
Helen, we're leaving.

1197
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:25,120
Yes, Mom.

1198
00:37:25,161 --> 00:37:27,706
No, mommy's got to be
somewhere around 4:00.

1199
00:37:27,747 --> 00:37:29,082
Why does she make me so nervous?

1200
00:37:29,124 --> 00:37:31,209
Because she's a
bona fide ice queen.

1201
00:37:31,251 --> 00:37:33,503
Elsa's got nothing on her.

1202
00:37:34,921 --> 00:37:36,256
Hey, Em.

1203
00:37:36,297 --> 00:37:37,525
I was wondering if I could
talk to you in private.

1204
00:37:37,549 --> 00:37:38,508
Sure.

1205
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:39,926
Yeah, I'll go find Nicole.

1206
00:37:42,971 --> 00:37:43,971
Oh, boy.

1207
00:37:44,472 --> 00:37:45,849
Oh, no.

1208
00:37:45,890 --> 00:37:47,368
I'm not really sure
how to tell you this,

1209
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:49,161
but it seems like you've
caused quite a scuttlebutt.

1210
00:37:49,185 --> 00:37:50,061
A scuttlebutt.

1211
00:37:50,103 --> 00:37:50,854
Mm-hmm.

1212
00:37:50,895 --> 00:37:51,730
What kind of scuttlebutt?

1213
00:37:51,771 --> 00:37:53,440
A little scuttlebutt.

1214
00:37:53,481 --> 00:37:55,751
You see, the thing is... it's
like after the Christmas tree

1215
00:37:55,775 --> 00:37:58,820
lighting and then the cookie
contest, visitors that

1216
00:37:58,862 --> 00:38:02,782
are outside the lane, they've
been a little disappointed

1217
00:38:02,824 --> 00:38:04,117
at your lack of decorations.

1218
00:38:04,159 --> 00:38:05,243
Outside the lane?

1219
00:38:05,285 --> 00:38:05,910
Mm.

1220
00:38:05,952 --> 00:38:06,327
Really?

1221
00:38:06,369 --> 00:38:07,370
Mm-hmm.

1222
00:38:07,412 --> 00:38:09,039
Fine.

1223
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:09,914
You know what?

1224
00:38:09,956 --> 00:38:10,540
I don't want to be a sore thumb.

1225
00:38:10,582 --> 00:38:12,083
Mm-mm.

1226
00:38:12,125 --> 00:38:13,084
And I promised my parents
I would do the minimum.

1227
00:38:13,126 --> 00:38:14,836
So when can you start?

1228
00:38:14,878 --> 00:38:16,397
As soon as I can get the bins
off the shelves in the garage.

1229
00:38:16,421 --> 00:38:17,464
That's all it takes?

1230
00:38:17,505 --> 00:38:20,467
Yeah.

1231
00:38:20,508 --> 00:38:22,469
Attention, all available units.

1232
00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:25,430
Rendezvous at
Melrose Manor, stat.

1233
00:38:25,472 --> 00:38:27,474
Operation Deck
the Halls is a go.

1234
00:38:27,515 --> 00:38:28,641
Over.

1235
00:38:28,683 --> 00:38:30,643
What is happening?

1236
00:38:33,146 --> 00:38:35,982
Hey, hey, hey.

1237
00:38:36,024 --> 00:38:37,400
Ho, ho, ho.

1238
00:38:37,442 --> 00:38:42,822
Deck the halls with
boughs of holly.

1239
00:38:42,864 --> 00:38:48,203
Fa-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la.

1240
00:38:48,244 --> 00:38:53,166
'Tis the season to be jolly.

1241
00:38:53,208 --> 00:38:54,542
Light them up.

1242
00:38:54,584 --> 00:38:59,339
Fa-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la.

1243
00:38:59,381 --> 00:39:02,634
Don we now our gay apparel.

1244
00:39:02,676 --> 00:39:06,638
Snow flakes, they're heavy.

1245
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:08,890
The bells are ringing.

1246
00:39:08,932 --> 00:39:10,558
I don't see any smiles here.

1247
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:12,352
We're working, but
we're having fun.

1248
00:39:12,394 --> 00:39:13,687
What is going on here?

1249
00:39:13,728 --> 00:39:15,730
This is classic
storage configuration.

1250
00:39:15,772 --> 00:39:19,401
We'll have you sorted
out in no time.

1251
00:39:19,442 --> 00:39:20,443
Nice.

1252
00:39:20,485 --> 00:39:21,319
Last one.

1253
00:39:21,361 --> 00:39:22,612
Great job.

1254
00:39:22,654 --> 00:39:23,446
I got it.

1255
00:39:23,488 --> 00:39:24,155
I got it.

1256
00:39:24,197 --> 00:39:25,490
Oh.

1257
00:39:25,532 --> 00:39:26,282
It's the nutcracker.

1258
00:39:26,324 --> 00:39:27,617
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

1259
00:39:27,659 --> 00:39:28,201
Thank you.

1260
00:39:28,243 --> 00:39:29,536
Oh.

1261
00:39:29,577 --> 00:39:31,329
One of the best in
the neighborhood.

1262
00:39:31,371 --> 00:39:33,206
Oh.

1263
00:39:33,248 --> 00:39:34,290
He's coming with me.

1264
00:39:34,332 --> 00:39:35,332
La-la-la-la.

1265
00:39:39,379 --> 00:39:42,215
That looks great.

1266
00:39:42,257 --> 00:39:43,299
Thank you so much.

1267
00:39:43,341 --> 00:39:44,676
That looks beautiful.

1268
00:39:44,718 --> 00:39:47,637
Hey, hey, hey.

1269
00:39:47,679 --> 00:39:50,223
Ho, ho, ho.

1270
00:39:50,265 --> 00:39:52,225
Hey, hey, hey.

1271
00:39:53,309 --> 00:39:54,686
Ho, ho, ho.

1272
00:39:54,728 --> 00:40:00,900
I think this should
bring me up to code.

1273
00:40:00,942 --> 00:40:03,194
We'll see about that.

1274
00:40:03,236 --> 00:40:04,236
Go ahead.

1275
00:40:08,658 --> 00:40:09,909
42 inches.

1276
00:40:09,951 --> 00:40:10,744
Someone's been reading
their handbook.

1277
00:40:10,785 --> 00:40:11,870
Well, not exactly.

1278
00:40:11,911 --> 00:40:13,191
But it does make
a good doorstop.

1279
00:40:16,541 --> 00:40:18,710
Care to do the honors?

1280
00:40:24,924 --> 00:40:29,054
Nice work.

1281
00:40:29,095 --> 00:40:30,764
You too.

1282
00:40:30,805 --> 00:40:33,808
You three.

1283
00:40:33,850 --> 00:40:35,685
This was amazing.

1284
00:40:35,727 --> 00:40:36,853
Thank you so much, everyone.

1285
00:40:36,895 --> 00:40:38,271
Now all you need
is a lawn display.

1286
00:40:38,313 --> 00:40:42,484
You know, I have an
extremely rare taxidermy set

1287
00:40:42,525 --> 00:40:44,778
of nine adult reindeer.

1288
00:40:44,819 --> 00:40:46,488
They're beautiful.

1289
00:40:46,529 --> 00:40:49,532
You just say the word, and I
will just wrangle those puppies

1290
00:40:49,574 --> 00:40:51,618
out of that parking
garage A-S-A-P.

1291
00:40:51,659 --> 00:40:53,995
Well, as lovely
as that sounds, I

1292
00:40:54,037 --> 00:40:56,956
think you've really
done enough already.

1293
00:40:56,998 --> 00:40:57,499
What?

1294
00:40:57,540 --> 00:40:59,125
Oh, no, no, no.

1295
00:40:59,167 --> 00:41:01,145
I am so grateful for your
help, really so grateful.

1296
00:41:01,169 --> 00:41:05,382
It's just I kind of
need to decompress.

1297
00:41:05,423 --> 00:41:06,383
That was a lot.

1298
00:41:06,424 --> 00:41:08,009
You sure?

1299
00:41:08,051 --> 00:41:09,344
Second wind here.

1300
00:41:09,386 --> 00:41:10,428
No.

1301
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:11,388
I'm totally sure.

1302
00:41:11,429 --> 00:41:13,431
You know how to find us.

1303
00:41:13,473 --> 00:41:15,767
Yes, I do.

1304
00:41:15,809 --> 00:41:18,728
This is just incredible, really.

1305
00:41:18,770 --> 00:41:21,398
You know, it just reminds
me of exactly what it

1306
00:41:21,439 --> 00:41:22,541
looked like when I was little.

1307
00:41:22,565 --> 00:41:23,858
You know what?

1308
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:25,443
I'd love to have you
all inside, and I

1309
00:41:25,485 --> 00:41:27,821
can make you a cup of cocoa
as a token of I appreciation.

1310
00:41:30,907 --> 00:41:32,117
What just happened?

1311
00:41:32,158 --> 00:41:33,660
I think it's a
Christmas miracle.

1312
00:41:33,702 --> 00:41:35,412
I'll take you up on that cocoa.

1313
00:41:35,453 --> 00:41:38,623
But the people just...

1314
00:41:38,665 --> 00:41:39,374
Looks great.

1315
00:41:39,416 --> 00:41:42,043
Kind of strange.

1316
00:41:42,085 --> 00:41:45,463
Santa, I am your father.

1317
00:41:45,505 --> 00:41:46,631
Got the hot cocoa.

1318
00:41:49,551 --> 00:41:51,678
Oh, great.

1319
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:53,138
Hey, that was really fun.

1320
00:41:53,179 --> 00:41:54,490
Thank you for getting
everyone to help out.

1321
00:41:54,514 --> 00:41:55,390
Oh, yeah.

1322
00:41:55,432 --> 00:41:56,307
Are you kidding me?

1323
00:41:56,349 --> 00:41:57,183
They wanted to do this.

1324
00:41:57,225 --> 00:41:58,327
Yeah, I got to chill out there.

1325
00:41:58,351 --> 00:41:59,519
Yeah, yeah.

1326
00:41:59,561 --> 00:42:00,520
It sure is freezing.

1327
00:42:00,562 --> 00:42:01,771
I'm going to come join you.

1328
00:42:03,732 --> 00:42:04,733
Oh, man.

1329
00:42:04,774 --> 00:42:06,484
Oh.

1330
00:42:06,526 --> 00:42:08,671
You know, I always thought my
parents were just so pushy,

1331
00:42:08,695 --> 00:42:10,572
making everyone follow
all of these rules

1332
00:42:10,613 --> 00:42:12,282
and do all of these activities.

1333
00:42:12,323 --> 00:42:16,327
But I'm starting to realize I
think people always wanted to.

1334
00:42:16,369 --> 00:42:18,788
They live for this.

1335
00:42:18,830 --> 00:42:21,458
Like, think about how
many lives your parents

1336
00:42:21,499 --> 00:42:24,627
changed by giving them
these amazing memories all

1337
00:42:24,669 --> 00:42:25,462
these years.

1338
00:42:25,503 --> 00:42:26,755
Yeah.

1339
00:42:26,796 --> 00:42:28,065
Speaking of which,
do you still have

1340
00:42:28,089 --> 00:42:30,383
those old Polaroids
from me and you together

1341
00:42:30,425 --> 00:42:31,444
at the Christmas carnival?

1342
00:42:31,468 --> 00:42:32,969
Oh, they have to
be here somewhere.

1343
00:42:33,011 --> 00:42:34,363
My parents threw
everything out that

1344
00:42:34,387 --> 00:42:36,348
was old unless it was
Christmas-related.

1345
00:42:36,389 --> 00:42:37,682
Right.

1346
00:42:37,724 --> 00:42:39,559
But I bet they're
stored away somewhere.

1347
00:42:39,601 --> 00:42:40,685
OK.

1348
00:42:40,727 --> 00:42:41,807
I'll have to look for them.

1349
00:42:41,853 --> 00:42:42,853
Yeah.

1350
00:42:44,898 --> 00:42:46,608
I've gotten pretty
close with your parents

1351
00:42:46,649 --> 00:42:48,276
since I moved back here.

1352
00:42:48,318 --> 00:42:51,613
And you know what they talk
about more than anything else?

1353
00:42:51,654 --> 00:42:52,781
Easy, Christmas.

1354
00:42:52,822 --> 00:42:56,576
No, it's... it's you.

1355
00:42:56,618 --> 00:42:58,411
Every time I see them it's...

1356
00:42:58,453 --> 00:43:01,081
Oh, did you see that new
article that Emily edited

1357
00:43:01,122 --> 00:43:02,832
for that amazing magazine.

1358
00:43:02,874 --> 00:43:05,502
Or, oh, Emily took us
this fantastic restaurant.

1359
00:43:05,543 --> 00:43:07,045
Or she's taking kickboxing now.

1360
00:43:07,087 --> 00:43:08,046
And she's a blue belt...

1361
00:43:08,088 --> 00:43:09,714
Purple belt. Purple belt.

1362
00:43:09,756 --> 00:43:11,299
Hm?

1363
00:43:11,341 --> 00:43:12,258
And they really shouldn't
have told you that.

1364
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:13,134
That is my secret superpower.

1365
00:43:13,176 --> 00:43:14,176
Mm.

1366
00:43:15,428 --> 00:43:17,722
Well, that's just the angel
on top of the Christmas tree.

1367
00:43:17,764 --> 00:43:18,765
I know all the dirt.

1368
00:43:18,807 --> 00:43:20,141
Really?

1369
00:43:20,183 --> 00:43:21,369
For instance, your
favorite sandwich

1370
00:43:21,393 --> 00:43:23,603
is a frozen peanut
butter and jelly.

1371
00:43:23,645 --> 00:43:24,479
That's gross.

1372
00:43:24,521 --> 00:43:25,980
You have to try it.

1373
00:43:26,022 --> 00:43:27,982
No, you are afraid of
basements but not attics.

1374
00:43:28,024 --> 00:43:30,318
I have my reasons.

1375
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:31,444
OK.

1376
00:43:31,486 --> 00:43:34,155
You are shamelessly,
unapologetically

1377
00:43:34,197 --> 00:43:37,659
in love with Nickelback.

1378
00:43:37,701 --> 00:43:39,452
Chad Kroeger was my everything.

1379
00:43:39,494 --> 00:43:43,248
I mean, that hair.

1380
00:43:43,289 --> 00:43:44,207
Oh, you good?

1381
00:43:44,249 --> 00:43:44,791
Yeah.

1382
00:43:44,833 --> 00:43:45,542
Did I lose you?

1383
00:43:45,583 --> 00:43:46,876
No, I'm good.

1384
00:43:46,918 --> 00:43:47,711
But this has gotten
a little strange.

1385
00:43:47,752 --> 00:43:48,753
Yeah, a little bit.

1386
00:43:48,795 --> 00:43:50,422
You kind of know a lot about me.

1387
00:43:50,463 --> 00:43:50,755
Well, your parents go on and
on and on and on about you.

1388
00:43:50,797 --> 00:43:52,132
So...

1389
00:43:52,173 --> 00:43:53,133
Honestly, they go
on and on about you,

1390
00:43:53,174 --> 00:43:54,009
the whole neighborhood does.

1391
00:43:54,050 --> 00:43:56,136
Well, that's nice, yeah.

1392
00:43:56,177 --> 00:43:59,764
When I moved here, they did
welcome me with arms wide open.

1393
00:43:59,806 --> 00:44:00,682
That's Creed.

1394
00:44:00,724 --> 00:44:01,724
You would know.

1395
00:44:05,812 --> 00:44:06,396
Oh.

1396
00:44:06,438 --> 00:44:07,689
Oh.

1397
00:44:07,731 --> 00:44:08,857
Oh, no.

1398
00:44:08,898 --> 00:44:09,774
I can't stay here.

1399
00:44:09,816 --> 00:44:10,817
Yeah, I'm on fire, so...

1400
00:44:10,859 --> 00:44:11,609
No, no.

1401
00:44:11,651 --> 00:44:13,111
I have to go.

1402
00:44:13,153 --> 00:44:13,778
I totally forgot about
my meeting with Pamela.

1403
00:44:13,820 --> 00:44:14,738
Oh, oh, go.

1404
00:44:14,779 --> 00:44:15,905
I'll let myself out.

1405
00:44:15,947 --> 00:44:16,698
Really?

1406
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:17,282
Are you sure?

1407
00:44:17,323 --> 00:44:17,824
Yeah.

1408
00:44:17,866 --> 00:44:18,950
I'm sorry.

1409
00:44:18,992 --> 00:44:19,617
But I'll see you soon, right?

1410
00:44:19,659 --> 00:44:20,368
Absolutely.

1411
00:44:20,410 --> 00:44:20,910
Well, hope so.

1412
00:44:20,952 --> 00:44:21,786
Great then.

1413
00:44:21,828 --> 00:44:23,246
Yeah, soon, soon.

1414
00:44:23,288 --> 00:44:29,586
Ooh, sorry about that.

1415
00:44:39,637 --> 00:44:40,638
Pamela, hi.

1416
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:42,140
I am so sorry.

1417
00:44:42,182 --> 00:44:44,062
I was decorating the house
with Santa's helpers.

1418
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:45,685
And I just lost track of time.

1419
00:44:45,727 --> 00:44:46,603
Hm, I'll say.

1420
00:44:46,644 --> 00:44:47,812
It's 5:23.

1421
00:44:47,854 --> 00:44:48,480
I know.

1422
00:44:48,521 --> 00:44:49,147
I'm sorry.

1423
00:44:49,189 --> 00:44:50,315
We agreed on 4:00.

1424
00:44:50,357 --> 00:44:52,067
We did say around 4:00.

1425
00:44:52,108 --> 00:44:53,943
Is 5:23 around 4:00?

1426
00:44:53,985 --> 00:44:56,780
Well, it's better
than 6:23, isn't it?

1427
00:44:56,821 --> 00:44:58,907
Is this the lady that made
you fill up the swear jar?

1428
00:44:58,948 --> 00:45:00,158
Oh.

1429
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:01,910
You know what, sweetie?

1430
00:45:01,951 --> 00:45:03,929
Why don't you just go on inside
and play with your dolls, OK?

1431
00:45:03,953 --> 00:45:05,497
I brought my dad's checklist.

1432
00:45:08,249 --> 00:45:10,293
He used this checklist
for the event for years.

1433
00:45:10,335 --> 00:45:11,711
Then you already have a roadmap.

1434
00:45:11,753 --> 00:45:12,671
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1435
00:45:12,712 --> 00:45:14,047
It's just that...

1436
00:45:14,089 --> 00:45:15,191
I don't know if you
could see this part.

1437
00:45:15,215 --> 00:45:16,591
It's 3 feet long.

1438
00:45:16,633 --> 00:45:17,884
Yeah.

1439
00:45:17,926 --> 00:45:19,278
But I really think
we could do it all

1440
00:45:19,302 --> 00:45:21,072
if we just like divvy it
up and do this together.

1441
00:45:21,096 --> 00:45:21,971
You know what?

1442
00:45:22,013 --> 00:45:23,598
That is a great idea.

1443
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:26,267
How about you do everything
on the list, and then you

1444
00:45:26,309 --> 00:45:27,435
tell me when you're done?

1445
00:45:27,477 --> 00:45:28,186
OK.

1446
00:45:28,228 --> 00:45:28,937
You're still mad.

1447
00:45:28,978 --> 00:45:29,771
I can tell.

1448
00:45:29,813 --> 00:45:31,690
I am so, so sorry.

1449
00:45:31,731 --> 00:45:34,025
But the entire neighborhood,
they all came out.

1450
00:45:34,067 --> 00:45:35,461
The neighborhood
came out to help me,

1451
00:45:35,485 --> 00:45:37,487
and I just got carried away.

1452
00:45:37,529 --> 00:45:39,989
I was carried away with the
Christmas spirit, you know?

1453
00:45:40,031 --> 00:45:41,116
OK, nice try.

1454
00:45:41,157 --> 00:45:43,034
But... I'll make it up to you.

1455
00:45:43,076 --> 00:45:43,827
How?

1456
00:45:43,868 --> 00:45:45,203
I don't know.

1457
00:45:45,245 --> 00:45:46,246
Do you have any ideas?

1458
00:45:46,287 --> 00:45:49,040
Actually, yes.

1459
00:45:49,082 --> 00:45:51,042
You've got tiny,
dexterous hands.

1460
00:45:51,084 --> 00:45:52,084
Come on in.

1461
00:45:57,048 --> 00:45:58,800
I need you with your
cute, little, baby

1462
00:45:58,842 --> 00:46:01,136
hands to thread popcorn.

1463
00:46:01,177 --> 00:46:03,471
Oh, my... that's
a lot of popcorn.

1464
00:46:04,973 --> 00:46:06,200
Yeah, I need the hot glue
stockings for my daughter's

1465
00:46:06,224 --> 00:46:07,892
girl scout troop.

1466
00:46:07,934 --> 00:46:11,271
We can go over the list while
you thread all that popcorn.

1467
00:46:11,312 --> 00:46:12,647
Don't move a muscle.

1468
00:46:12,689 --> 00:46:16,151
I'll be right back
with my hot glue gun.

1469
00:46:16,192 --> 00:46:17,277
Don't eat it!

1470
00:46:22,365 --> 00:46:24,242
OK, you know, if I'm
being completely honest,

1471
00:46:24,284 --> 00:46:26,786
I've always wanted to take
a crack at your dad's list.

1472
00:46:26,828 --> 00:46:29,706
I've just always admired
his organizational skills.

1473
00:46:29,748 --> 00:46:30,999
Look at this.

1474
00:46:31,041 --> 00:46:32,792
OK, "get required
permit from HOA."

1475
00:46:32,834 --> 00:46:33,668
We can do that.

1476
00:46:33,710 --> 00:46:35,211
You know what?

1477
00:46:35,253 --> 00:46:36,355
I'm going to talk to Oscar
Parcell about the parking.

1478
00:46:36,379 --> 00:46:37,797
He likes to be
courted, you know?

1479
00:46:37,839 --> 00:46:38,882
Oh, OK.

1480
00:46:38,923 --> 00:46:39,632
I'll bring over my cookies.

1481
00:46:39,674 --> 00:46:41,343
He'll be great.

1482
00:46:41,384 --> 00:46:42,862
OK, "pick up extra gloves from
community donation center."

1483
00:46:42,886 --> 00:46:43,678
We can do that.

1484
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:44,137
Ow!

1485
00:46:44,179 --> 00:46:44,804
Stop.

1486
00:46:44,846 --> 00:46:45,388
Don't.

1487
00:46:45,430 --> 00:46:46,014
Stop.

1488
00:46:46,056 --> 00:46:46,931
Go through it.

1489
00:46:46,973 --> 00:46:47,515
Push through the pain.

1490
00:46:47,557 --> 00:46:48,557
Sorry.

1491
00:46:53,938 --> 00:46:54,856
Good morning.

1492
00:46:54,898 --> 00:46:56,649
Look who's right on time.

1493
00:46:56,691 --> 00:46:57,525
How are you feeling?

1494
00:46:57,567 --> 00:46:58,735
You know what?

1495
00:46:58,777 --> 00:47:00,379
I woke up with a bit
of a crick in my neck.

1496
00:47:00,403 --> 00:47:01,547
I think I must have
slept wrong or something.

1497
00:47:01,571 --> 00:47:02,364
I think it's the way
you were stringing

1498
00:47:02,405 --> 00:47:02,947
the popcorn last night.

1499
00:47:02,989 --> 00:47:03,865
Really?

1500
00:47:03,907 --> 00:47:05,367
What do you mean?

1501
00:47:05,408 --> 00:47:06,242
Correct posture and regular
chiropractic adjustments

1502
00:47:06,284 --> 00:47:07,827
are a must.

1503
00:47:07,869 --> 00:47:09,079
I wrote my dissertation on it.

1504
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:10,622
Wait, you have a PhD?

1505
00:47:10,663 --> 00:47:11,206
Wow, in what?

1506
00:47:11,247 --> 00:47:12,247
Arts and crafts.

1507
00:47:14,751 --> 00:47:15,835
Hm.

1508
00:47:15,877 --> 00:47:17,379
With a minor in scrapbooking!

1509
00:47:17,420 --> 00:47:18,421
Wow.

1510
00:47:18,463 --> 00:47:19,464
Easy.

1511
00:47:19,506 --> 00:47:21,508
Now, don't you break on me.

1512
00:47:21,549 --> 00:47:22,801
I mean it.

1513
00:47:22,842 --> 00:47:24,469
There you go.

1514
00:47:24,511 --> 00:47:25,679
Ah.

1515
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:28,014
Oh, that is amazing.

1516
00:47:28,056 --> 00:47:29,641
And a few days late.

1517
00:47:29,683 --> 00:47:32,060
Perfection is
worth the citation.

1518
00:47:32,102 --> 00:47:32,894
OK.

1519
00:47:32,936 --> 00:47:33,728
Good morning, Ned.

1520
00:47:33,770 --> 00:47:35,063
Good morning.

1521
00:47:35,105 --> 00:47:36,415
We're just going around
the neighborhood,

1522
00:47:36,439 --> 00:47:38,000
trying to get donations
for the Snowman Tableau.

1523
00:47:38,024 --> 00:47:38,983
Of course, of course.

1524
00:47:39,025 --> 00:47:41,069
Ah, what do you need?

1525
00:47:41,111 --> 00:47:42,404
Really anything.

1526
00:47:42,445 --> 00:47:45,448
Buttons, carrots,
beanies, old clothing,

1527
00:47:45,490 --> 00:47:46,574
anything you can think of.

1528
00:47:46,616 --> 00:47:48,326
Oh, oh.

1529
00:47:48,368 --> 00:47:50,787
I've got 12 hazmat suits.

1530
00:47:50,829 --> 00:47:53,790
You can make a post-apocalyptic
gang of snow people.

1531
00:47:53,832 --> 00:47:55,417
OK, you know what?

1532
00:47:55,458 --> 00:47:57,544
Just get us a few carrots
and an old beanie net, OK?

1533
00:47:57,585 --> 00:47:58,628
Your loss.

1534
00:47:58,670 --> 00:47:59,689
You don't know what
you're missing.

1535
00:47:59,713 --> 00:48:00,713
Yeah, I do.

1536
00:48:03,341 --> 00:48:04,217
OK, you know what?

1537
00:48:04,259 --> 00:48:05,176
That's just dangerous.

1538
00:48:05,218 --> 00:48:06,928
How?

1539
00:48:06,970 --> 00:48:08,280
Well, some poor kid is going to
get his tongue stuck on that.

1540
00:48:08,304 --> 00:48:09,431
Why would he be licking it?

1541
00:48:09,472 --> 00:48:10,390
I don't know what...

1542
00:48:10,432 --> 00:48:11,975
I don't know how kids think.

1543
00:48:12,017 --> 00:48:15,854
They like to lick stuff and
eat stuff off the floor.

1544
00:48:15,895 --> 00:48:16,604
Is that coal?

1545
00:48:16,646 --> 00:48:17,355
Yep.

1546
00:48:17,397 --> 00:48:18,606
Do you actually burn it?

1547
00:48:18,648 --> 00:48:20,233
No, I'm more of a
green energy guy.

1548
00:48:20,275 --> 00:48:21,693
Then why do you have coal?

1549
00:48:21,735 --> 00:48:22,777
Stocking stuffers.

1550
00:48:22,819 --> 00:48:24,320
You mean like for
the naughty kids.

1551
00:48:24,362 --> 00:48:26,156
Yeah, but I don't have
the heart to put them

1552
00:48:26,197 --> 00:48:27,615
in anyone's stocking.

1553
00:48:27,657 --> 00:48:31,161
So I'm mainly just use
them as snowman eyes.

1554
00:48:31,202 --> 00:48:32,620
And we wonder why we're single.

1555
00:48:32,662 --> 00:48:33,830
Bzzz.

1556
00:48:33,872 --> 00:48:34,414
OK, don't.

1557
00:48:34,456 --> 00:48:35,957
You know what?

1558
00:48:35,999 --> 00:48:37,459
Have you
been on the naughty list?

1559
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:38,251
No, I've never been on
a naughty list ever.

1560
00:48:38,293 --> 00:48:39,127
Santa says otherwise.

1561
00:48:39,169 --> 00:48:40,170
He would never say...

1562
00:48:40,211 --> 00:48:40,837
Are you sure?

1563
00:48:40,879 --> 00:48:41,254
OK, stop it.

1564
00:48:41,296 --> 00:48:42,172
Not you.

1565
00:48:42,213 --> 00:48:43,213
She seems frustrated.

1566
00:48:43,882 --> 00:48:44,215
All right, you know what?

1567
00:48:44,257 --> 00:48:44,966
Fine.

1568
00:48:45,008 --> 00:48:45,967
We'll take it.

1569
00:48:46,009 --> 00:48:46,968
Just put it in the wagon!

1570
00:48:47,010 --> 00:48:47,594
Why is she yelling at me?

1571
00:48:47,635 --> 00:48:48,053
Stop that!

1572
00:48:48,094 --> 00:48:48,803
Bzzz.

1573
00:48:48,845 --> 00:48:49,387
She does a lot.

1574
00:48:49,429 --> 00:48:50,429
Don't do that!

1575
00:48:51,181 --> 00:48:51,973
So how long have you lived here?

1576
00:48:52,015 --> 00:48:52,974
Five years in November.

1577
00:48:53,016 --> 00:48:53,641
Where did you live before?

1578
00:48:53,683 --> 00:48:55,101
In Highland.

1579
00:48:55,143 --> 00:48:58,521
I would bring my daughter
here every Christmas season.

1580
00:48:58,563 --> 00:49:00,815
It's her favorite thing to do.

1581
00:49:00,857 --> 00:49:03,443
My husband, he travels a
lot for work and sometimes

1582
00:49:03,485 --> 00:49:04,903
during the holidays.

1583
00:49:04,944 --> 00:49:07,322
So we would come here to
be part of a community.

1584
00:49:07,364 --> 00:49:09,491
I told Ned to cut these.

1585
00:49:09,532 --> 00:49:11,117
That's really sweet.

1586
00:49:11,159 --> 00:49:13,411
Is he traveling
this holiday season?

1587
00:49:13,453 --> 00:49:14,871
Yes and no.

1588
00:49:14,913 --> 00:49:16,331
What do you mean?

1589
00:49:16,373 --> 00:49:17,957
He had unexpected trip come up.

1590
00:49:17,999 --> 00:49:20,043
And before he could figure
out his work schedule,

1591
00:49:20,085 --> 00:49:22,379
all the flights back to
Salt Lake were booked solid.

1592
00:49:22,420 --> 00:49:24,214
It's the busiest time
of the year, you know,

1593
00:49:24,255 --> 00:49:26,341
holidays and ski season.

1594
00:49:26,383 --> 00:49:27,735
So the earliest
you can get back is

1595
00:49:27,759 --> 00:49:29,344
the afternoon of Christmas Day.

1596
00:49:29,386 --> 00:49:30,095
Oh, my goodness.

1597
00:49:30,136 --> 00:49:31,054
I'm so sorry.

1598
00:49:31,096 --> 00:49:33,765
Well, it is what it is.

1599
00:49:33,807 --> 00:49:35,517
And at least we've
got Evergreen Lane.

1600
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:40,397
Hey, but... no, no, no.

1601
00:49:40,438 --> 00:49:41,356
No, no, no, no, no.

1602
00:49:41,398 --> 00:49:42,315
What are you doing?

1603
00:49:42,357 --> 00:49:44,567
Is that another citation?

1604
00:49:44,609 --> 00:49:45,151
No, no.

1605
00:49:45,193 --> 00:49:45,860
No citation.

1606
00:49:45,902 --> 00:49:47,153
Invitation.

1607
00:49:47,195 --> 00:49:48,029
It's my annual White
Elephant Party.

1608
00:49:48,071 --> 00:49:49,239
Be warned.

1609
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:51,032
It can get pretty competitive.

1610
00:49:51,074 --> 00:49:53,535
A couple of years ago, the
police had to come break it up.

1611
00:49:53,576 --> 00:49:56,204
Yeah, if Ned's there, just
don't bring power tools.

1612
00:49:56,246 --> 00:49:59,332
It still gives me night terrors.

1613
00:49:59,374 --> 00:50:00,125
How are you doing?

1614
00:50:00,166 --> 00:50:01,835
Comes and goes.

1615
00:50:01,876 --> 00:50:03,461
You guys did great
on the donations.

1616
00:50:03,503 --> 00:50:05,022
Yeah, people were
really happy to help.

1617
00:50:05,046 --> 00:50:05,714
Yeah.

1618
00:50:05,755 --> 00:50:07,257
And it was nice.

1619
00:50:07,298 --> 00:50:09,551
Pamela and I had some really
nice quality neighbor time.

1620
00:50:09,592 --> 00:50:11,052
Oh, actually, we're
not neighbors.

1621
00:50:11,094 --> 00:50:12,053
It's your parents' house.

1622
00:50:12,095 --> 00:50:12,804
Oh, true.

1623
00:50:12,846 --> 00:50:13,471
Yeah.

1624
00:50:13,513 --> 00:50:14,347
But you know what?

1625
00:50:14,389 --> 00:50:15,265
I didn't hate it.

1626
00:50:15,306 --> 00:50:18,560
Oh, that's good, yeah.

1627
00:50:18,601 --> 00:50:20,228
So I'll just go
through all the stuff

1628
00:50:20,270 --> 00:50:21,521
and organize it in the bins.

1629
00:50:21,563 --> 00:50:22,915
That way you can go
be home with Helen.

1630
00:50:22,939 --> 00:50:23,690
That's really nice.

1631
00:50:23,732 --> 00:50:25,233
OK.

1632
00:50:25,275 --> 00:50:27,253
Please keep the carrots away
from the hats and the mittens.

1633
00:50:27,277 --> 00:50:28,111
Absolutely.

1634
00:50:28,153 --> 00:50:28,903
That's a vegetable.

1635
00:50:28,945 --> 00:50:29,279
They're fabric.

1636
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:29,863
Oh, yes.

1637
00:50:29,904 --> 00:50:30,280
OK.

1638
00:50:30,321 --> 00:50:30,905
100%.

1639
00:50:30,947 --> 00:50:31,364
Oh.

1640
00:50:31,406 --> 00:50:32,032
Got it.

1641
00:50:32,073 --> 00:50:32,574
Great.

1642
00:50:32,615 --> 00:50:33,615
OK.

1643
00:50:36,286 --> 00:50:37,245
What a 180, huh?

1644
00:50:37,287 --> 00:50:38,955
Yeah, please don't jinx it.

1645
00:50:38,997 --> 00:50:40,457
Oh, no.

1646
00:50:40,498 --> 00:50:41,416
I didn't want to say
this when she was around,

1647
00:50:41,458 --> 00:50:44,794
but there's your citation.

1648
00:50:44,836 --> 00:50:45,337
For what?

1649
00:50:45,378 --> 00:50:46,921
No lawn display.

1650
00:50:46,963 --> 00:50:48,858
I don't know if you noticed,
but I was kind of busy

1651
00:50:48,882 --> 00:50:50,425
fulfilling my
obligation to the HOA

1652
00:50:50,467 --> 00:50:52,302
by collecting things
for the Snowman Tableau.

1653
00:50:52,344 --> 00:50:54,095
Actually, I did notice.

1654
00:50:54,137 --> 00:50:56,407
That's why the penalty's been
reduced to mandatory attendance

1655
00:50:56,431 --> 00:50:57,766
to my White Elephant Party.

1656
00:50:57,807 --> 00:50:58,933
Oh, OK.

1657
00:50:58,975 --> 00:51:01,770
So it's a party I
literally can't miss.

1658
00:51:01,811 --> 00:51:03,396
That's an excellent
way of putting it.

1659
00:51:03,438 --> 00:51:04,522
Yes.

1660
00:51:08,193 --> 00:51:09,652
I'll help you.

1661
00:51:14,699 --> 00:51:16,201
Oh, honey, no, we
don't have any.

1662
00:51:16,242 --> 00:51:18,286
If we kept all the lawn
displays from every year,

1663
00:51:18,328 --> 00:51:20,538
we wouldn't have any room
in the house for furniture.

1664
00:51:20,580 --> 00:51:22,457
So what did you do with them?

1665
00:51:22,499 --> 00:51:24,542
Your father donated
them to charity.

1666
00:51:24,584 --> 00:51:26,044
And you bought new
ones every year?

1667
00:51:26,086 --> 00:51:28,505
Yep, and we always had
the best ones, didn't we?

1668
00:51:29,881 --> 00:51:31,108
Remember that
10-foot-tall polar bear?

1669
00:51:31,132 --> 00:51:32,342
Do I remember it?

1670
00:51:32,384 --> 00:51:33,402
That thing still
gives me nightmares.

1671
00:51:33,426 --> 00:51:34,552
It was a classic.

1672
00:51:34,594 --> 00:51:35,428
Is that Jared?

1673
00:51:35,470 --> 00:51:36,429
Uh, yeah.

1674
00:51:36,471 --> 00:51:37,389
He's helping me out today.

1675
00:51:37,430 --> 00:51:39,057
Hey, Mr. and Mrs. Melrose.

1676
00:51:39,099 --> 00:51:40,475
Ooh, hi, Jared.

1677
00:51:40,517 --> 00:51:41,810
Hey, Jared.

1678
00:51:41,851 --> 00:51:43,120
Oh, honey, they're
hanging out together.

1679
00:51:43,144 --> 00:51:44,062
Yes.

1680
00:51:44,104 --> 00:51:44,729
Isn't that wonderful?

1681
00:51:44,771 --> 00:51:45,397
Lovely, just lovely.

1682
00:51:45,438 --> 00:51:46,189
Oh, Albert.

1683
00:51:46,231 --> 00:51:47,065
OK, thank you.

1684
00:51:47,107 --> 00:51:47,774
Thank you anyway.

1685
00:51:47,816 --> 00:51:48,525
We're going to go now.

1686
00:51:48,566 --> 00:51:49,067
Bye, sweetie.

1687
00:51:49,109 --> 00:51:50,109
Bye.

1688
00:51:50,276 --> 00:51:51,027
Have fun.

1689
00:51:51,069 --> 00:51:51,528
OK, turn it off.

1690
00:51:51,569 --> 00:51:52,570
It's off.

1691
00:51:52,612 --> 00:51:53,238
No, all the way off, Albert.

1692
00:51:53,279 --> 00:51:54,072
It is off.

1693
00:51:54,114 --> 00:51:54,614
It's still green.

1694
00:51:54,656 --> 00:51:55,573
Green is off.

1695
00:51:55,615 --> 00:51:57,242
Oh, honey, are you sure?

1696
00:51:57,283 --> 00:51:58,678
What if they can hear us? 'Cause
last time they could hear us.

1697
00:51:58,702 --> 00:51:59,661
They can't hear us,
because it's off.

1698
00:51:59,703 --> 00:52:00,453
Is that the teakettle boiling?

1699
00:52:00,495 --> 00:52:01,121
Did I make tea?

1700
00:52:01,162 --> 00:52:03,790
You did.

1701
00:52:03,832 --> 00:52:05,917
Emily, I still have
all the lawn displays.

1702
00:52:05,959 --> 00:52:06,626
What?

1703
00:52:06,668 --> 00:52:07,544
Are you kidding me?

1704
00:52:07,585 --> 00:52:08,753
I can't part with those.

1705
00:52:08,795 --> 00:52:10,255
They're my most
prized possessions.

1706
00:52:10,296 --> 00:52:11,673
So where are they?

1707
00:52:11,715 --> 00:52:12,984
In a storage locker
just outside of town.

1708
00:52:13,008 --> 00:52:14,384
I'll text you the information.

1709
00:52:14,426 --> 00:52:16,428
The key is an empty
shoe polish can

1710
00:52:16,469 --> 00:52:17,762
in the top drawer of my desk.

1711
00:52:17,804 --> 00:52:19,407
But whatever you do,
don't tell your mother.

1712
00:52:19,431 --> 00:52:20,598
OK, no, no.

1713
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:22,350
Don't worry.

1714
00:52:22,392 --> 00:52:25,186
You're very sweet and partially
insane secret is safe with us.

1715
00:52:25,228 --> 00:52:26,312
Taking it to my grave, sir.

1716
00:52:26,354 --> 00:52:27,313
OK.

1717
00:52:27,355 --> 00:52:29,024
Take anything you want.

1718
00:52:29,065 --> 00:52:30,918
And if anyone asks, you found
them at The Salvation Army.

1719
00:52:30,942 --> 00:52:31,609
Got it.

1720
00:52:31,651 --> 00:52:32,651
Who are you talking to?

1721
00:52:34,487 --> 00:52:36,239
Oh, and those are my parents.

1722
00:52:36,281 --> 00:52:37,281
Legends.

1723
00:52:45,206 --> 00:52:48,293
It's like an episode of
"Hoarders," holiday edition.

1724
00:52:48,335 --> 00:52:49,336
It's like a dream.

1725
00:52:52,172 --> 00:52:54,632
You know, my dad said the lawn
display was the crowning piece

1726
00:52:54,674 --> 00:52:55,800
of decoration.

1727
00:52:55,842 --> 00:52:57,469
It's got to be just right.

1728
00:52:57,510 --> 00:52:59,137
Anything inspire you?

1729
00:52:59,179 --> 00:53:00,805
Yeah, you know what?

1730
00:53:00,847 --> 00:53:02,932
Yes.

1731
00:53:02,974 --> 00:53:05,060
So this guy is Ned, obviously.

1732
00:53:05,101 --> 00:53:06,144
Of course.

1733
00:53:06,186 --> 00:53:08,063
And here we have
Mary Louise and Bob.

1734
00:53:08,104 --> 00:53:09,272
Adorable.

1735
00:53:09,314 --> 00:53:12,275
And the elf is Pamela,
always hard at work

1736
00:53:12,317 --> 00:53:13,818
and a little intense.

1737
00:53:13,860 --> 00:53:16,154
And then, here, I'm
Rudolph, the new kid

1738
00:53:16,196 --> 00:53:18,323
on the block who's trying
to figure everything out.

1739
00:53:18,365 --> 00:53:20,325
And where am I?

1740
00:53:20,367 --> 00:53:21,701
Give me that citation pad.

1741
00:53:26,289 --> 00:53:28,583
I'm Santa?

1742
00:53:28,625 --> 00:53:29,501
Of course, you are.

1743
00:53:29,542 --> 00:53:30,752
Who else would you be?

1744
00:53:30,794 --> 00:53:32,253
Do you know, when
I was a little kid,

1745
00:53:32,295 --> 00:53:34,106
I actually wanted to be
Santa Claus when I grew up?

1746
00:53:34,130 --> 00:53:35,590
Aww.

1747
00:53:35,632 --> 00:53:36,508
Were you just heartbroken
when you found out

1748
00:53:36,549 --> 00:53:38,218
that wasn't possible?

1749
00:53:38,259 --> 00:53:39,862
No, I have studied and research
the Santa Claus 1, 2, and 3.

1750
00:53:39,886 --> 00:53:42,305
I am convinced it
is still possible.

1751
00:53:43,431 --> 00:53:45,517
Ho, ho, ho, everybody.

1752
00:53:45,558 --> 00:53:47,018
What happened here?

1753
00:53:47,060 --> 00:53:49,312
Did a Christmas comet
land on your house?

1754
00:53:49,354 --> 00:53:52,273
Well, I guess you could say
I got into the spirit a bit.

1755
00:53:52,315 --> 00:53:55,318
Yeah, this is Clark
Griswold level decoration.

1756
00:53:55,360 --> 00:53:56,462
Did you do this all by yourself?

1757
00:53:56,486 --> 00:53:57,404
Mm-hmm.

1758
00:53:57,445 --> 00:53:58,363
Jared helped.

1759
00:53:58,405 --> 00:53:59,698
Are you her boyfriend now?

1760
00:53:59,739 --> 00:54:02,117
Oh, um, no.

1761
00:54:02,158 --> 00:54:04,411
Do you want to be?

1762
00:54:04,452 --> 00:54:05,704
Nicole, we're just friends.

1763
00:54:05,745 --> 00:54:07,539
Yeah, friends.

1764
00:54:07,580 --> 00:54:10,208
That's what Hannah said when I
asked her if she liked Jaden.

1765
00:54:10,250 --> 00:54:13,712
Then, Braxton saw them holding
hands under the lunch table.

1766
00:54:13,753 --> 00:54:16,047
Have you guys held hands yet?

1767
00:54:16,089 --> 00:54:16,548
Nope.

1768
00:54:16,589 --> 00:54:17,215
Mm-mm.

1769
00:54:17,257 --> 00:54:17,590
Nope.

1770
00:54:17,632 --> 00:54:19,009
Mm-mm.

1771
00:54:19,050 --> 00:54:20,152
Don't let her make you
feel uncomfortable.

1772
00:54:20,176 --> 00:54:21,553
We encourage her
to speak her mind.

1773
00:54:21,594 --> 00:54:23,054
You see something,
you say something.

1774
00:54:23,096 --> 00:54:25,098
OK, well, this isn't
the airport, Kevin.

1775
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:27,142
I'm sorry.

1776
00:54:27,183 --> 00:54:28,577
You don't have to answer
that if you don't want to.

1777
00:54:28,601 --> 00:54:29,686
We made you cookies.

1778
00:54:29,728 --> 00:54:31,271
We used sugar this time.

1779
00:54:31,312 --> 00:54:32,397
I hope you don't mind.

1780
00:54:32,439 --> 00:54:33,398
Oh, nice.

1781
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:34,733
Good call.

1782
00:54:34,774 --> 00:54:36,401
Well, we should head inside.

1783
00:54:36,443 --> 00:54:38,069
Do you want to join us?

1784
00:54:38,111 --> 00:54:40,089
Oh, yes, it's... see, it's
against the HOA rules for me

1785
00:54:40,113 --> 00:54:42,574
to say no to cookies so yes.

1786
00:54:42,615 --> 00:54:43,615
OK.

1787
00:54:46,286 --> 00:54:47,286
Hello.

1788
00:54:50,749 --> 00:54:52,083
You know, Dasher
and Dancer and...

1789
00:54:52,125 --> 00:54:52,625
Comet.

1790
00:54:52,667 --> 00:54:53,960
Prancer.

1791
00:54:54,002 --> 00:54:55,313
You're skipping
literally the only one.

1792
00:54:55,337 --> 00:54:56,421
Dancer.

1793
00:54:56,463 --> 00:54:57,297
Gosh, I should've gotten that.

1794
00:54:57,339 --> 00:54:58,631
How did you did that?

1795
00:54:58,673 --> 00:54:59,984
All right, big guy,
let's see what you got.

1796
00:55:00,008 --> 00:55:00,550
OK, uh...

1797
00:55:00,592 --> 00:55:01,593
Exhausting.

1798
00:55:01,634 --> 00:55:02,674
Oh, the Christmas Carlton!

1799
00:55:05,847 --> 00:55:07,515
My turn, finally.

1800
00:55:07,557 --> 00:55:08,933
Guys, ready for this?

1801
00:55:08,975 --> 00:55:09,851
Do you want the moon?

1802
00:55:09,893 --> 00:55:11,561
Just say the word.

1803
00:55:11,603 --> 00:55:12,955
I'll throw a lasso around
it, and I'll pull it down.

1804
00:55:12,979 --> 00:55:14,397
Oh, oh, Bing Crosby.

1805
00:55:14,439 --> 00:55:15,357
Are you kidding?

1806
00:55:15,398 --> 00:55:16,775
OK, everyone.

1807
00:55:16,816 --> 00:55:19,652
Welcome to the annual
Snowman Tableau.

1808
00:55:21,321 --> 00:55:22,321
Yeah!

1809
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:27,327
Pamela and I are so excited
you could all make it.

1810
00:55:27,369 --> 00:55:30,413
And we cannot wait to see what
awesome snow people you make.

1811
00:55:30,455 --> 00:55:33,875
So listen up, we have some
carrot for noses, hats,

1812
00:55:33,917 --> 00:55:35,543
scarves, clothes, buttons.

1813
00:55:35,585 --> 00:55:36,628
Coal for eyes.

1814
00:55:36,670 --> 00:55:38,713
What kind of coal is it?

1815
00:55:38,755 --> 00:55:41,383
Uh, kind that comes
from the ground?

1816
00:55:41,424 --> 00:55:42,634
No need to be childish.

1817
00:55:42,676 --> 00:55:43,861
All coal comes from the ground.

1818
00:55:43,885 --> 00:55:45,929
Is that anthracite
or bituminous?

1819
00:55:45,970 --> 00:55:47,764
It's for snowman eyes, Ned.

1820
00:55:47,806 --> 00:55:48,824
Does it make a difference?

1821
00:55:48,848 --> 00:55:51,434
Well, maybe not to you.

1822
00:55:51,476 --> 00:55:55,480
Anywho, does anyone
else have any questions?

1823
00:55:55,522 --> 00:55:56,231
No.

1824
00:55:56,272 --> 00:55:57,774
Yes, Ned.

1825
00:55:57,816 --> 00:56:00,151
Can we use rebar to ensure
structural integrity?

1826
00:56:00,193 --> 00:56:01,778
Rebar?

1827
00:56:01,820 --> 00:56:03,154
Yeah.

1828
00:56:03,196 --> 00:56:05,323
Currently it is 41
degrees Fahrenheit,

1829
00:56:05,365 --> 00:56:06,366
5 degrees centigrade.

1830
00:56:06,408 --> 00:56:08,576
Without adequate
internal support,

1831
00:56:08,618 --> 00:56:10,453
my design will not be able to...

1832
00:56:10,495 --> 00:56:11,121
You know what?

1833
00:56:11,162 --> 00:56:13,665
Go nuts.

1834
00:56:13,707 --> 00:56:15,583
All right, everybody,
let the fun begin!

1835
00:56:15,625 --> 00:56:16,625
Yeah!

1836
00:56:19,838 --> 00:56:21,798
Candles burning low.

1837
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:24,884
Hanging mistletoe.

1838
00:56:24,926 --> 00:56:30,807
Lots of snow and ice
everywhere we go.

1839
00:56:30,849 --> 00:56:36,730
Choir singing carols
right outside my door.

1840
00:56:36,771 --> 00:56:39,399
All these things and more.

1841
00:56:39,441 --> 00:56:41,776
All these things and more.

1842
00:56:41,818 --> 00:56:45,196
That's what Christmas
means to me, my love.

1843
00:56:45,238 --> 00:56:47,824
That's what Christmas
means to me, my love.

1844
00:56:47,866 --> 00:56:49,909
Oh, about tonight's party,
there is a dress code.

1845
00:56:49,951 --> 00:56:51,870
Oh, I brought everything
I own when I moved out,

1846
00:56:51,911 --> 00:56:53,371
so I should be covered.

1847
00:56:53,413 --> 00:56:56,207
Is it formal or semi-formal
or Christmas casual?

1848
00:56:56,249 --> 00:56:56,958
Ugly sweater.

1849
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:58,501
Oh, nice, classy.

1850
00:56:58,543 --> 00:57:01,004
Your parents always had
the most hideous sweaters.

1851
00:57:01,046 --> 00:57:02,398
I have no idea
where they got them.

1852
00:57:02,422 --> 00:57:05,550
Yeah, those were just
their regular sweaters.

1853
00:57:08,470 --> 00:57:09,530
Do you know what this means?

1854
00:57:09,554 --> 00:57:10,638
What?

1855
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:11,598
Snowball fight.

1856
00:57:11,639 --> 00:57:12,849
Snowball fight?

1857
00:57:12,891 --> 00:57:14,184
Every man for himself.

1858
00:57:14,225 --> 00:57:14,893
No rules.

1859
00:57:14,934 --> 00:57:17,270
No mercy Oh.

1860
00:57:17,312 --> 00:57:17,812
Mm.

1861
00:57:17,854 --> 00:57:18,938
Fall back!

1862
00:57:18,980 --> 00:57:20,106
Fall back.

1863
00:57:20,148 --> 00:57:20,732
Regroup.

1864
00:57:20,774 --> 00:57:21,775
Fall back.

1865
00:57:21,816 --> 00:57:24,277
You will live to regret that!

1866
00:57:24,319 --> 00:57:27,155
Ned, I've been waiting
all year for this.

1867
00:57:27,197 --> 00:57:29,657
I'm coming for you, sister.

1868
00:57:30,658 --> 00:57:31,993
Cheap shot.

1869
00:57:32,035 --> 00:57:32,994
Cheap shot.

1870
00:57:33,036 --> 00:57:35,538
Bob, return my Tupperware!

1871
00:57:35,580 --> 00:57:37,916
Come on.

1872
00:57:37,957 --> 00:57:38,875
Don't surrender.

1873
00:57:38,917 --> 00:57:41,920
Don't retreat.

1874
00:57:41,961 --> 00:57:43,755
I got one with your name on it.

1875
00:57:43,797 --> 00:57:46,591
This one's for you, Farnsworth.

1876
00:57:46,633 --> 00:57:48,051
Yeah!

1877
00:57:48,093 --> 00:57:51,054
That'll hurt in the morning.

1878
00:57:51,096 --> 00:57:52,931
I've got cat-like reflexes.

1879
00:57:52,972 --> 00:57:53,932
Hey, hey, hey.

1880
00:57:53,973 --> 00:57:54,973
Come here.

1881
00:57:59,521 --> 00:58:01,815
I came prepared.

1882
00:58:10,073 --> 00:58:11,282
A little much.

1883
00:58:14,744 --> 00:58:17,789
Ah, let's see.

1884
00:58:17,831 --> 00:58:19,541
Oh, just right.

1885
00:58:19,582 --> 00:58:20,582
Mm-hmm.

1886
00:58:55,493 --> 00:58:59,289
Hm.

1887
00:58:59,330 --> 00:59:00,330
Pamela?

1888
00:59:24,689 --> 00:59:26,066
Ho, ho, ho, ho.

1889
00:59:26,107 --> 00:59:27,400
Merry Christmas.

1890
00:59:28,360 --> 00:59:28,985
Here.

1891
00:59:29,027 --> 00:59:30,528
Oh, thank you.

1892
00:59:30,570 --> 00:59:31,321
Watch this guy.

1893
00:59:31,363 --> 00:59:33,281
Hey, I only had two.

1894
00:59:36,701 --> 00:59:37,994
Is that what I think it is?

1895
00:59:38,036 --> 00:59:39,662
I have no idea how
I found it but yes.

1896
00:59:41,915 --> 00:59:44,542
Oh, oh, this is very impressive.

1897
00:59:44,584 --> 00:59:45,627
This whole thing?

1898
00:59:45,669 --> 00:59:47,253
The internet's is
a wonderful place.

1899
00:59:47,295 --> 00:59:48,922
I see you found
your parents' stash.

1900
00:59:48,963 --> 00:59:51,383
Yes, it's a 1987
classic, I believe.

1901
00:59:51,424 --> 00:59:53,176
'87, a fine year indeed.

1902
00:59:53,218 --> 00:59:54,886
And this is for you.

1903
00:59:54,928 --> 00:59:56,304
This is amazing.

1904
00:59:56,346 --> 00:59:58,139
But what we really
need to do is this.

1905
00:59:58,181 --> 00:59:59,015
Come here.

1906
00:59:59,057 --> 01:00:00,642
Ready?

1907
01:00:00,684 --> 01:00:01,893
OK, 1, 2, Santa.

1908
01:00:04,688 --> 01:00:06,564
All right, this will
go perfectly right next

1909
01:00:06,606 --> 01:00:07,107
to the other one.

1910
01:00:07,148 --> 01:00:08,441
Come see.

1911
01:00:08,483 --> 01:00:10,068
I don't really share
this with anyone,

1912
01:00:10,110 --> 01:00:14,614
but I've been thinking about
installing a retractable roof

1913
01:00:14,656 --> 01:00:15,657
on my house.

1914
01:00:15,699 --> 01:00:17,492
Why?

1915
01:00:17,534 --> 01:00:21,538
So I could plant a 60-foot old
growth tree in my living room.

1916
01:00:21,579 --> 01:00:23,790
Ned, have you ever
thought about therapy?

1917
01:00:23,832 --> 01:00:25,500
I've been in therapy for years.

1918
01:00:25,542 --> 01:00:29,129
Have you ever thought about
getting a different therapist?

1919
01:00:29,170 --> 01:00:31,006
Look what I found.

1920
01:00:31,047 --> 01:00:32,841
There.

1921
01:00:32,882 --> 01:00:34,217
Almost a perfect recreation.

1922
01:00:34,259 --> 01:00:35,135
You still have it.

1923
01:00:35,176 --> 01:00:37,387
Yeah, I love that photo.

1924
01:00:37,429 --> 01:00:39,931
Ooh, it's almost singing time.

1925
01:00:43,435 --> 01:00:46,730
Ho, ho, ho, who wouldn't go?

1926
01:00:46,771 --> 01:00:49,482
Ho, ho, ho, who would go?

1927
01:00:49,524 --> 01:00:52,777
Oh, up on the housetop,
click, click, click.

1928
01:00:52,819 --> 01:00:56,197
Down to the chimney
with good St. Nick.

1929
01:00:56,239 --> 01:01:01,453
Fall on your knees.

1930
01:01:01,494 --> 01:01:07,375
Oh, hear the angel's voices.

1931
01:01:07,417 --> 01:01:10,920
Oh, jingle bells, jingle bells,

1932
01:01:10,962 --> 01:01:13,423
jingle all the way.

1933
01:01:13,465 --> 01:01:17,886
Oh, what fun it is to ride
in a one horse open sleigh.

1934
01:01:17,927 --> 01:01:18,927
Hey.

1935
01:01:19,554 --> 01:01:20,096
Whoo-hoo!

1936
01:01:20,138 --> 01:01:21,931
Whoa, come on.

1937
01:01:21,973 --> 01:01:23,224
I'm so glad you found these.

1938
01:01:23,266 --> 01:01:24,517
That's you, Pam, right?

1939
01:01:24,559 --> 01:01:26,039
Yeah, that was during
my poncho phase.

1940
01:01:26,978 --> 01:01:27,937
Whoo, you look on that one.

1941
01:01:27,979 --> 01:01:28,979
Oh.

1942
01:01:30,607 --> 01:01:33,818
You'd never know it, but Jared's
actually very stressed out.

1943
01:01:33,860 --> 01:01:34,819
About what?

1944
01:01:34,861 --> 01:01:36,112
The Christmas carnival.

1945
01:01:36,154 --> 01:01:38,114
The Santa he booked
had to cancel.

1946
01:01:38,156 --> 01:01:40,116
Apparently, he sprained his lap.

1947
01:01:40,158 --> 01:01:41,910
Oh, no.

1948
01:01:41,951 --> 01:01:43,286
Can he find a replacement?

1949
01:01:43,328 --> 01:01:44,913
No, it's three days
until Christmas.

1950
01:01:44,954 --> 01:01:46,790
Everybody's booked.

1951
01:01:46,831 --> 01:01:48,667
He's already so busy
with everything else.

1952
01:01:48,708 --> 01:01:50,418
I'm worried he's not
going to find anyone.

1953
01:01:50,460 --> 01:01:52,253
Maybe I could help find someone.

1954
01:01:52,295 --> 01:01:53,797
That would be wonderful.

1955
01:01:53,838 --> 01:01:55,757
I'll tell him you'll
take it off his plate.

1956
01:01:55,799 --> 01:01:57,759
He'll be so relieved.

1957
01:01:57,801 --> 01:01:58,885
Maybe Ned could do it.

1958
01:01:58,927 --> 01:02:02,013
My record is 2 minutes
and 13 seconds.

1959
01:02:02,055 --> 01:02:04,140
Pain is all in the mind.

1960
01:02:06,643 --> 01:02:08,895
Keep thinking.

1961
01:02:08,937 --> 01:02:11,231
Ned, stop it.

1962
01:02:11,272 --> 01:02:12,107
Ooh.

1963
01:02:12,148 --> 01:02:12,941
All right, everyone.

1964
01:02:12,982 --> 01:02:13,775
It's time.

1965
01:02:13,817 --> 01:02:14,984
Oh, yes.

1966
01:02:15,026 --> 01:02:16,026
It is time.

1967
01:02:16,361 --> 01:02:17,862
It's time.

1968
01:02:17,904 --> 01:02:21,157
On your turn, you can either
take a wrapped present.

1969
01:02:21,199 --> 01:02:23,326
Or you can steal
from someone else.

1970
01:02:23,368 --> 01:02:25,120
But there's a twist.

1971
01:02:25,161 --> 01:02:26,830
Pay attention, Ned.

1972
01:02:26,871 --> 01:02:30,792
The lightning round, you have
10 seconds for one final swap.

1973
01:02:30,834 --> 01:02:31,751
Ready?

1974
01:02:31,793 --> 01:02:32,502
Who has number one?

1975
01:02:32,544 --> 01:02:33,253
I do.

1976
01:02:33,294 --> 01:02:34,294
Take it away, Mom.

1977
01:02:37,549 --> 01:02:39,300
OK.

1978
01:02:39,342 --> 01:02:40,635
I didn't want that one anyway.

1979
01:02:40,677 --> 01:02:41,677
Drum roll.

1980
01:02:46,307 --> 01:02:47,726
What is it?

1981
01:02:47,767 --> 01:02:50,186
It's a top-of-the-line
condensation monitor.

1982
01:02:50,228 --> 01:02:51,563
Well, sorry, Belinda.

1983
01:02:51,604 --> 01:02:53,148
No one's trading you.

1984
01:02:53,189 --> 01:02:55,316
What's wrong with you people?

1985
01:02:59,988 --> 01:03:05,952
Jingle bells, jingle
bells, jingle all the way.

1986
01:03:06,536 --> 01:03:07,454
Oh.

1987
01:03:07,495 --> 01:03:09,581
OK, don't get too attached.

1988
01:03:09,622 --> 01:03:12,959
Don't anybody think
about trading this.

1989
01:03:13,001 --> 01:03:16,046
Oh, how fun it
is to ride on a one horse

1990
01:03:16,087 --> 01:03:17,297
open sleigh.

1991
01:03:17,339 --> 01:03:18,798
Hey!

1992
01:03:18,840 --> 01:03:22,927
Jingle bells, jingle
bells, jingle all the way.

1993
01:03:22,969 --> 01:03:28,308
Oh, what fun it is to ride
on a one horse open sleigh.

1994
01:03:28,350 --> 01:03:30,894
Oh, yeah!

1995
01:04:02,967 --> 01:04:07,389
Oh, what fun it
is to ride on a one horse

1996
01:04:07,430 --> 01:04:09,015
open sleigh!

1997
01:04:20,068 --> 01:04:21,695
Hey.

1998
01:04:21,736 --> 01:04:22,487
Hello.

1999
01:04:22,529 --> 01:04:23,655
How's checklist coming?

2000
01:04:23,697 --> 01:04:25,323
Hey.

2001
01:04:25,365 --> 01:04:27,134
Well, other than about a dozen
boxes being empty, it's great.

2002
01:04:27,158 --> 01:04:29,452
Well, you can check the Santa
box, because I found someone

2003
01:04:29,494 --> 01:04:30,829
to do it.

2004
01:04:30,870 --> 01:04:32,247
What?

2005
01:04:32,288 --> 01:04:33,248
Yeah, your mom said you
were so stressed and asked

2006
01:04:33,289 --> 01:04:34,207
if I could help.

2007
01:04:34,249 --> 01:04:34,916
Why would do... she did?

2008
01:04:34,958 --> 01:04:36,042
Yeah.

2009
01:04:36,084 --> 01:04:37,794
So it took a few
hours, but I think I've

2010
01:04:37,836 --> 01:04:40,588
convinced Kevin to volunteer.

2011
01:04:40,630 --> 01:04:41,673
Who's Kevin?

2012
01:04:41,715 --> 01:04:43,800
Hello, Jessica's husband.

2013
01:04:43,842 --> 01:04:45,427
Now, I don't have a Santa suit.

2014
01:04:45,468 --> 01:04:47,345
But I'm thinking
that Pam can help us.

2015
01:04:47,387 --> 01:04:49,014
The woman has a PhD
in arts and crafts.

2016
01:04:49,055 --> 01:04:53,268
She can probably whip something
up in an afternoon blindfolded.

2017
01:04:53,309 --> 01:04:55,770
She sure could for, yeah, Kevin.

2018
01:04:55,812 --> 01:04:59,357
Oh, I'll hold for applause.

2019
01:04:59,399 --> 01:05:02,402
Do you have any idea how hard it
is to find a Santa on Christmas

2020
01:05:02,444 --> 01:05:03,069
Eve-eve?

2021
01:05:03,111 --> 01:05:04,029
Yeah.

2022
01:05:04,070 --> 01:05:05,321
Yeah.

2023
01:05:05,363 --> 01:05:06,281
It's like finding
the actual Santa.

2024
01:05:06,322 --> 01:05:07,866
Yeah, thank you.

2025
01:05:07,907 --> 01:05:08,783
Thank you.

2026
01:05:08,825 --> 01:05:10,201
Well, you don't look happy.

2027
01:05:10,243 --> 01:05:11,202
I thought you'd be happy.

2028
01:05:11,244 --> 01:05:12,662
Yeah, I'm happy.

2029
01:05:12,704 --> 01:05:14,164
Don't I look happy?

2030
01:05:14,205 --> 01:05:15,808
No, you look like I put
coal in your stocking.

2031
01:05:15,832 --> 01:05:17,542
Oh, oh, it's Christmas time.

2032
01:05:17,584 --> 01:05:18,835
Of course, I'm happy.

2033
01:05:18,877 --> 01:05:19,502
I'm just a little
stressed right now.

2034
01:05:19,544 --> 01:05:20,503
My mom's right.

2035
01:05:20,545 --> 01:05:21,796
I have a lot on my plate.

2036
01:05:21,838 --> 01:05:25,216
But good luck with
Kevin or Pam or Kevin.

2037
01:05:25,258 --> 01:05:26,258
Good luck.

2038
01:05:31,765 --> 01:05:32,724
Are you sure about this?

2039
01:05:32,766 --> 01:05:34,059
Oh, don't be ridiculous.

2040
01:05:34,100 --> 01:05:35,977
I can make a Santa
suit with my eyes shut.

2041
01:05:36,019 --> 01:05:37,604
See, I had a hunch
you would say that.

2042
01:05:37,645 --> 01:05:39,397
Just get me his
measurements, stem to stern.

2043
01:05:39,439 --> 01:05:42,317
In about 60 to 90 minutes,
I'll have him looking exactly

2044
01:05:42,359 --> 01:05:43,544
like "Miracle on 34th Street."

2045
01:05:43,568 --> 01:05:44,986
Oh, you are a magician.

2046
01:05:45,028 --> 01:05:46,029
Thank you so much.

2047
01:05:46,071 --> 01:05:48,198
It's an advanced
degree, not magic.

2048
01:05:48,239 --> 01:05:49,657
Right.

2049
01:05:49,699 --> 01:05:51,659
It sounds like you're
having a wonderful time.

2050
01:05:51,701 --> 01:05:53,119
Honestly, I am.

2051
01:05:53,161 --> 01:05:54,430
Everyone's working so
hard, but this time it

2052
01:05:54,454 --> 01:05:56,414
doesn't feel like work.

2053
01:05:56,456 --> 01:05:58,416
It's kind of magical.

2054
01:05:58,458 --> 01:06:01,336
I think I finally understand
why you and dad made service

2055
01:06:01,378 --> 01:06:02,796
such a priority
over the holidays.

2056
01:06:02,837 --> 01:06:04,464
Your father will be
so glad to hear it.

2057
01:06:04,506 --> 01:06:06,091
He's in a Thai
massage right now.

2058
01:06:06,132 --> 01:06:08,510
But he'll be so
pleased to hear that.

2059
01:06:08,551 --> 01:06:10,011
Tell me, how's it
going with Jared?

2060
01:06:10,053 --> 01:06:11,096
I don't know, Mom.

2061
01:06:11,137 --> 01:06:13,973
I mean, he's such
a special guy even

2062
01:06:14,015 --> 01:06:17,227
though he's extremely
quirky and downright goofy

2063
01:06:17,268 --> 01:06:18,436
sometimes.

2064
01:06:18,478 --> 01:06:20,271
He's just so sweet.

2065
01:06:20,313 --> 01:06:21,940
He's so charming.

2066
01:06:21,981 --> 01:06:25,568
I meant how's it going with
his HOA duties but go on.

2067
01:06:25,610 --> 01:06:26,444
Oh, oh, right.

2068
01:06:26,486 --> 01:06:27,946
No, no, no.

2069
01:06:27,987 --> 01:06:29,882
He's an excellent president,
very good president.

2070
01:06:29,906 --> 01:06:31,616
Everyone is really
happy with him.

2071
01:06:31,658 --> 01:06:32,927
I just wish he
wasn't so stressed.

2072
01:06:32,951 --> 01:06:34,786
Uh-oh, what's he worried about?

2073
01:06:34,828 --> 01:06:37,038
Well, the Santa he hired
canceled last minute,

2074
01:06:37,080 --> 01:06:38,498
and he was too busy
to deal with it.

2075
01:06:38,540 --> 01:06:40,625
So I took over.

2076
01:06:40,667 --> 01:06:43,837
And I don't think he
really appreciated that.

2077
01:06:43,878 --> 01:06:45,088
Why not?

2078
01:06:45,130 --> 01:06:46,482
Well, when I told him I
found someone to do it,

2079
01:06:46,506 --> 01:06:49,050
he acted kind of cold.

2080
01:06:49,092 --> 01:06:50,760
It's like I offended
him or something.

2081
01:06:50,802 --> 01:06:52,512
Maybe because you
did offend him.

2082
01:06:52,554 --> 01:06:53,471
What?

2083
01:06:53,513 --> 01:06:55,098
By trying to help?

2084
01:06:55,140 --> 01:06:57,159
By not asking the one person
it would mean the most to,

2085
01:06:57,183 --> 01:06:57,851
sweetie.

2086
01:06:57,892 --> 01:07:01,646
Right, of course.

2087
01:07:01,688 --> 01:07:03,314
How did I not
think of that, Mom?

2088
01:07:03,356 --> 01:07:06,276
I guess I've still got some of
those mom skills lying around.

2089
01:07:06,317 --> 01:07:07,777
Mad mom skills.

2090
01:07:07,819 --> 01:07:08,737
All right, I got to go.

2091
01:07:08,778 --> 01:07:10,155
I have to go fix this.

2092
01:07:10,196 --> 01:07:11,239
Merry Christmas.

2093
01:07:11,281 --> 01:07:12,073
Merry Christmas.

2094
01:07:12,115 --> 01:07:13,324
Cannonball!

2095
01:07:13,366 --> 01:07:13,950
Oh.

2096
01:07:13,992 --> 01:07:15,368
Oh!

2097
01:07:37,307 --> 01:07:38,308
Hello.

2098
01:07:38,350 --> 01:07:39,351
No more "ho ho ho" chime?

2099
01:07:39,392 --> 01:07:40,352
I disconnected it.

2100
01:07:40,393 --> 01:07:41,311
How come?

2101
01:07:41,353 --> 01:07:45,440
Just wasn't feeling it.

2102
01:07:45,482 --> 01:07:49,486
Well, maybe this will help
put you back in the spirit.

2103
01:07:49,527 --> 01:07:50,570
What's that?

2104
01:07:50,612 --> 01:07:51,780
It's a little nutcracker.

2105
01:07:56,576 --> 01:07:57,452
Still too small.

2106
01:07:57,494 --> 01:07:58,578
I know.

2107
01:07:58,620 --> 01:08:00,747
It's too small for your porch.

2108
01:08:00,789 --> 01:08:02,582
But it's not too
small for your mantel.

2109
01:08:02,624 --> 01:08:05,543
And that right there
has sentimental value.

2110
01:08:05,585 --> 01:08:06,503
Him?

2111
01:08:06,544 --> 01:08:07,087
Yes.

2112
01:08:07,128 --> 01:08:08,046
Mm.

2113
01:08:08,088 --> 01:08:09,589
That right there
is the beginning

2114
01:08:09,631 --> 01:08:11,150
of how you got me into
the Christmas spirit

2115
01:08:11,174 --> 01:08:12,926
on Evergreen Lane.

2116
01:08:12,967 --> 01:08:14,219
Really?

2117
01:08:14,260 --> 01:08:16,680
Yes, and since then, I
have had the best week.

2118
01:08:16,721 --> 01:08:20,100
And that's because of you.

2119
01:08:20,141 --> 01:08:22,727
You're so devoted to making
everyone happy that I foolishly

2120
01:08:22,769 --> 01:08:24,312
assumed you were
too busy to fulfill

2121
01:08:24,354 --> 01:08:27,524
your true calling this year.

2122
01:08:27,565 --> 01:08:28,959
What are you saying
to me right now?

2123
01:08:28,983 --> 01:08:32,070
That I think you would
make the best Santa ever.

2124
01:08:32,112 --> 01:08:34,239
And I am so sorry I
didn't ask before.

2125
01:08:34,280 --> 01:08:36,032
But I'm here now.

2126
01:08:36,074 --> 01:08:39,160
Just a girl standing
in front of a boy,

2127
01:08:39,202 --> 01:08:41,830
asking him to be the
most perfect Santa Claus.

2128
01:08:41,871 --> 01:08:43,164
I thought you'd never ask.

2129
01:08:47,335 --> 01:08:48,253
So happy you're happy.

2130
01:08:48,294 --> 01:08:49,504
Thank you.

2131
01:08:49,546 --> 01:08:51,589
So we actually
have to get to Pam,

2132
01:08:51,631 --> 01:08:53,049
so that we can give
her your sizes.

2133
01:08:53,091 --> 01:08:53,425
OK.

2134
01:08:53,466 --> 01:08:54,259
OK.

2135
01:08:54,300 --> 01:08:55,300
Yay.

2136
01:09:00,265 --> 01:09:01,933
Kevin has short
arms and tiny hands.

2137
01:09:01,975 --> 01:09:03,393
Well, it's not my
fault. The suit

2138
01:09:03,435 --> 01:09:05,395
was constructed on the
measurements I was given.

2139
01:09:05,437 --> 01:09:06,312
I know.

2140
01:09:06,354 --> 01:09:07,564
I am so sorry, Pamela.

2141
01:09:07,605 --> 01:09:08,833
We rushed over as
soon as we could.

2142
01:09:08,857 --> 01:09:10,692
I didn't think you'd
finish it so fast.

2143
01:09:10,734 --> 01:09:11,818
Hey, what can I say?

2144
01:09:11,860 --> 01:09:13,361
I was in the zone.

2145
01:09:13,403 --> 01:09:15,739
Well, do you think you
could let it out a little?

2146
01:09:15,780 --> 01:09:16,948
Oh, sure.

2147
01:09:16,990 --> 01:09:18,199
It is a Santa suit after all.

2148
01:09:18,241 --> 01:09:20,660
I'll just magically
add fabric to it!

2149
01:09:20,702 --> 01:09:21,804
No, no, no, no, sorry, sorry.

2150
01:09:21,828 --> 01:09:22,871
I was just brainstorming.

2151
01:09:22,912 --> 01:09:24,372
Ned has a spare Santa suit.

2152
01:09:24,414 --> 01:09:25,665
What'd you guys think?

2153
01:09:25,707 --> 01:09:27,059
Hey, it's no threat
out of my bobbin.

2154
01:09:27,083 --> 01:09:28,501
Go.

2155
01:09:28,543 --> 01:09:29,294
Go!

2156
01:09:29,336 --> 01:09:30,003
Oh, sorry.

2157
01:09:30,045 --> 01:09:31,338
I have several actually.

2158
01:09:31,379 --> 01:09:33,340
You never know when
one will come in handy.

2159
01:09:33,381 --> 01:09:34,716
Ah.

2160
01:09:34,758 --> 01:09:39,346
Yeah, here is the
Barry Manilow Santa.

2161
01:09:39,387 --> 01:09:40,889
Beautiful.

2162
01:09:40,930 --> 01:09:46,478
This is the traditional
Norwegian laplander Santa.

2163
01:09:46,519 --> 01:09:48,355
Darth Vader Santa, very popular.

2164
01:09:48,396 --> 01:09:51,524
OK, what about just
a classic mall Santa?

2165
01:09:51,566 --> 01:09:52,609
If you must.

2166
01:09:55,653 --> 01:09:59,616
Ah, here we are.

2167
01:09:59,657 --> 01:10:00,658
Yes, yes.

2168
01:10:00,700 --> 01:10:02,243
You, sir, are a lifesaver.

2169
01:10:02,285 --> 01:10:04,120
Right.

2170
01:10:04,162 --> 01:10:06,456
Sign here and
return in 48 hours.

2171
01:10:06,498 --> 01:10:07,707
I live across the street, Ned.

2172
01:10:07,749 --> 01:10:09,000
Right.

2173
01:10:09,042 --> 01:10:10,269
That's why I'm
waiving the deposit.

2174
01:10:10,293 --> 01:10:11,086
How kind of you.

2175
01:10:11,127 --> 01:10:12,295
Sign for the boots as well.

2176
01:10:12,337 --> 01:10:14,339
Separate entry.

2177
01:10:14,381 --> 01:10:14,714
Here.

2178
01:10:14,756 --> 01:10:15,340
Grazie.

2179
01:10:15,382 --> 01:10:16,382
Oh.

2180
01:10:16,841 --> 01:10:18,468
Is it time?

2181
01:10:18,510 --> 01:10:19,177
It's time.

2182
01:10:19,219 --> 01:10:21,596
Time for what?

2183
01:10:21,638 --> 01:10:24,391
I hereby nominate Emily
Melrose to be officially named

2184
01:10:24,432 --> 01:10:27,018
to team Kringle as one
of Santa's helpers.

2185
01:10:27,060 --> 01:10:28,061
I second the nomination.

2186
01:10:28,103 --> 01:10:29,396
Put the motion to a vote.

2187
01:10:29,437 --> 01:10:30,313
All in favor say aye.

2188
01:10:30,355 --> 01:10:30,689
Aye.

2189
01:10:30,730 --> 01:10:31,690
Aye.

2190
01:10:31,731 --> 01:10:32,899
The motion has passed.

2191
01:10:32,941 --> 01:10:34,210
It is with great
pride that I bestow

2192
01:10:34,234 --> 01:10:36,319
upon you, Emily Melrose,
the great honor...

2193
01:10:36,361 --> 01:10:37,737
And responsibility.

2194
01:10:37,779 --> 01:10:39,382
And responsibility
of officially becoming

2195
01:10:39,406 --> 01:10:40,406
one of Santa's helpers.

2196
01:10:44,077 --> 01:10:45,078
Huzzah!

2197
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:45,495
Huzzah!

2198
01:10:45,537 --> 01:10:47,914
Huzzah!

2199
01:10:47,956 --> 01:10:50,166
This is not a toy.

2200
01:10:50,208 --> 01:10:52,043
You have a lot of ground
to cover out there.

2201
01:10:52,085 --> 01:10:54,212
Keep in constant
communicado, capiche?

2202
01:10:54,254 --> 01:10:55,338
Capiche.

2203
01:10:55,380 --> 01:10:57,590
Never leave a helper
without a hand.

2204
01:10:57,632 --> 01:10:58,842
Congratulations.

2205
01:10:58,883 --> 01:11:00,635
Congratulations.

2206
01:11:00,677 --> 01:11:03,638
Attention, team
Kringle, mount up!

2207
01:11:03,680 --> 01:11:04,597
Yeah!

2208
01:11:04,639 --> 01:11:05,932
Let's move, move, move.

2209
01:11:05,974 --> 01:11:08,351
Watch out with the
steps we sneak up on.

2210
01:11:08,393 --> 01:11:08,893
Yeah, let's go.

2211
01:11:08,935 --> 01:11:09,561
Let's go!

2212
01:11:09,602 --> 01:11:10,562
Let's go!

2213
01:11:10,603 --> 01:11:11,563
Get the lead out.

2214
01:11:11,604 --> 01:11:12,355
North Pole.

2215
01:11:12,397 --> 01:11:13,231
Christmas tree.

2216
01:11:13,273 --> 01:11:14,774
Move, move, move, move, move.

2217
01:11:14,816 --> 01:11:16,192
I'll take cinnamon buns.

2218
01:11:16,234 --> 01:11:17,318
Let's go!

2219
01:11:19,320 --> 01:11:20,238
Are you OK?

2220
01:11:20,280 --> 01:11:20,905
Got it.

2221
01:11:20,947 --> 01:11:22,657
Sure you got it.

2222
01:11:22,699 --> 01:11:25,243
All right.

2223
01:11:25,285 --> 01:11:25,827
I'm Dasher.

2224
01:11:25,869 --> 01:11:26,869
I'm Dancer.

2225
01:11:30,081 --> 01:11:30,999
Everything looks great.

2226
01:11:31,041 --> 01:11:32,083
Looks so great.

2227
01:11:32,125 --> 01:11:33,626
Want to take it for a test spin?

2228
01:11:33,668 --> 01:11:34,878
Oh, come on.

2229
01:11:34,919 --> 01:11:35,754
It's just a chair.

2230
01:11:35,795 --> 01:11:38,131
It's not just a chair.

2231
01:11:38,173 --> 01:11:41,426
This is where reality is
suspended, where children still

2232
01:11:41,468 --> 01:11:42,302
believe in magic.

2233
01:11:42,344 --> 01:11:44,554
Mm, then it's really special.

2234
01:11:44,596 --> 01:11:47,057
Yeah.

2235
01:11:47,098 --> 01:11:47,891
Let's give it a try.

2236
01:11:47,932 --> 01:11:48,932
Yeah.

2237
01:11:53,480 --> 01:11:56,149
You were made for this.

2238
01:11:56,191 --> 01:11:57,484
I hope I do it justice.

2239
01:11:57,525 --> 01:11:59,486
I'm sure you will.

2240
01:11:59,527 --> 01:12:02,405
Well, it's just beautiful.

2241
01:12:02,447 --> 01:12:04,449
Couldn't agree more.

2242
01:12:04,491 --> 01:12:08,453
All right, we
have a busy day tomorrow.

2243
01:12:08,495 --> 01:12:10,497
So I should head home.

2244
01:12:10,538 --> 01:12:12,040
Oh, I caught that.

2245
01:12:12,082 --> 01:12:13,833
Caught what?

2246
01:12:13,875 --> 01:12:15,502
That right there
was the first time

2247
01:12:15,543 --> 01:12:17,730
since you've been back that you
refer to your parent's place

2248
01:12:17,754 --> 01:12:19,631
as home.

2249
01:12:19,673 --> 01:12:22,842
Huh, I guess I did.

2250
01:12:22,884 --> 01:12:24,386
Night.

2251
01:12:24,427 --> 01:12:25,427
Goodnight.

2252
01:12:35,063 --> 01:12:36,648
Oh, Pamela.

2253
01:12:36,690 --> 01:12:41,903
I am so sorry about the
whole Santa suit debacle.

2254
01:12:41,945 --> 01:12:42,779
Are you OK?

2255
01:12:42,821 --> 01:12:45,198
No.

2256
01:12:45,240 --> 01:12:47,450
So I just got off
the phone with Alan.

2257
01:12:47,492 --> 01:12:49,703
Looks like there's a
winter storm system moving

2258
01:12:49,744 --> 01:12:50,995
into the East Coast.

2259
01:12:51,037 --> 01:12:54,165
And it's supposed
to hit on the 25th.

2260
01:12:54,207 --> 01:12:55,834
Good news is my
nana in Pittsburgh

2261
01:12:55,875 --> 01:12:57,419
will have a White Christmas.

2262
01:12:57,460 --> 01:13:02,173
Bad news is that his flight will
most definitely be canceled.

2263
01:13:02,215 --> 01:13:07,012
And I have to tell Helen
again that she's not going

2264
01:13:07,053 --> 01:13:10,015
to see her father on Christmas.

2265
01:13:10,056 --> 01:13:11,349
I'm so sorry.

2266
01:13:11,391 --> 01:13:13,018
It's fine.

2267
01:13:13,059 --> 01:13:14,894
That's why we have
Evergreen Lane.

2268
01:13:14,936 --> 01:13:16,604
Please don't tell the others.

2269
01:13:16,646 --> 01:13:19,024
Last thing I want to do
is dampen their spirits.

2270
01:13:19,065 --> 01:13:21,568
I won't say a word.

2271
01:13:21,609 --> 01:13:24,029
I really didn't want to
be alone this Christmas.

2272
01:13:32,203 --> 01:13:34,581
Usually someone
hugs you, hug them.

2273
01:13:38,585 --> 01:13:39,627
It's OK.

2274
01:13:48,386 --> 01:13:48,803
Hey.

2275
01:13:48,845 --> 01:13:50,764
Dan, hi.

2276
01:13:50,805 --> 01:13:54,059
Hi, hi, hi, it's me.

2277
01:13:54,100 --> 01:13:55,268
Listen, we need to talk.

2278
01:14:20,335 --> 01:14:21,628
Here you go, sweetheart.

2279
01:14:21,670 --> 01:14:22,837
Extra marshmallows.

2280
01:14:22,879 --> 01:14:24,047
Thank you.

2281
01:14:24,089 --> 01:14:25,149
What time should
I take over, Mary?

2282
01:14:25,173 --> 01:14:26,049
1 o'clock.

2283
01:14:26,091 --> 01:14:27,425
OK, I'll be back then.

2284
01:14:27,467 --> 01:14:28,843
Can we go see Santa now?

2285
01:14:28,885 --> 01:14:29,761
Yes, of course, honey.

2286
01:14:29,803 --> 01:14:30,595
Ooh, you know what?

2287
01:14:30,637 --> 01:14:31,304
Let's go now.

2288
01:14:31,346 --> 01:14:32,305
We'll beat the line.

2289
01:14:32,347 --> 01:14:33,848
Santa, we're coming for you!

2290
01:14:35,433 --> 01:14:37,036
Well, you really seem to
be fitting in around here.

2291
01:14:37,060 --> 01:14:38,478
You know what?

2292
01:14:38,520 --> 01:14:39,312
As strange as it seems,
I think you're right.

2293
01:14:39,354 --> 01:14:40,730
I'm glad to hear it.

2294
01:14:40,772 --> 01:14:41,874
Does that mean you're
thinking of moving back?

2295
01:14:41,898 --> 01:14:43,566
Oh, I don't know.

2296
01:14:43,608 --> 01:14:45,127
But if you hear of a place for
rent, I'd take a look at it.

2297
01:14:45,151 --> 01:14:46,695
Ooh, I'll keep my
ear to the ground.

2298
01:14:46,736 --> 01:14:48,714
I know one girl who'll be
very happy to have you back.

2299
01:14:48,738 --> 01:14:50,657
It's so nice to be
close to Nicole again.

2300
01:14:50,699 --> 01:14:51,574
I meant me.

2301
01:14:51,616 --> 01:14:52,616
Oh.

2302
01:14:53,743 --> 01:14:55,328
Thank you, London.

2303
01:14:55,370 --> 01:14:56,204
Merry Christmas to you.

2304
01:14:56,246 --> 01:14:57,789
Merry Christmas.

2305
01:14:57,831 --> 01:14:59,040
OK, Trixie.

2306
01:14:59,082 --> 01:15:00,125
Who do we have next?

2307
01:15:00,166 --> 01:15:02,460
Well, Santa, you
remember Nicole.

2308
01:15:02,502 --> 01:15:04,379
Nicole, of course,
Merry Christmas to you.

2309
01:15:04,421 --> 01:15:05,797
Do you want to sit
in Santa's lap?

2310
01:15:05,839 --> 01:15:06,381
No, thank you.

2311
01:15:06,423 --> 01:15:07,423
Oh.

2312
01:15:07,590 --> 01:15:09,092
Oh, OK.

2313
01:15:09,134 --> 01:15:10,695
A little girl who knows what
she wants, Santa loves that.

2314
01:15:10,719 --> 01:15:12,846
Why do you refer to yourself
in the third person?

2315
01:15:12,887 --> 01:15:14,848
That's a great question.

2316
01:15:14,889 --> 01:15:17,225
Oh, a more important
question is, have you

2317
01:15:17,267 --> 01:15:18,893
been naughty or nice?

2318
01:15:18,935 --> 01:15:19,811
A little bit of both.

2319
01:15:19,853 --> 01:15:20,854
Like everyone, right?

2320
01:15:20,895 --> 01:15:22,230
I suppose.

2321
01:15:22,272 --> 01:15:24,858
Look, I know you're
not the real Santa.

2322
01:15:24,899 --> 01:15:26,317
It's OK.

2323
01:15:26,359 --> 01:15:28,278
We should pretend for
all the grown-ups sake.

2324
01:15:28,319 --> 01:15:29,422
I'm picking
up what you put down.

2325
01:15:29,446 --> 01:15:30,756
OK, what do you
want for Christmas?

2326
01:15:30,780 --> 01:15:31,448
Two things.

2327
01:15:31,489 --> 01:15:33,033
Hit me.

2328
01:15:33,074 --> 01:15:36,202
I'd like some new furniture for
my doll house, ideally Bauhuas

2329
01:15:36,244 --> 01:15:38,913
or Danish modern.

2330
01:15:38,955 --> 01:15:40,457
What else?

2331
01:15:40,498 --> 01:15:42,268
I'd like that handsome
architect to take my Aunt

2332
01:15:42,292 --> 01:15:43,960
Emily on a date.

2333
01:15:44,002 --> 01:15:45,337
I told you.

2334
01:15:45,378 --> 01:15:46,421
She's always listening.

2335
01:15:46,463 --> 01:15:47,797
See?

2336
01:15:47,839 --> 01:15:49,567
That is what I call highly
effective communication.

2337
01:15:49,591 --> 01:15:50,591
Uh-huh.

2338
01:15:51,593 --> 01:15:53,029
What makes you think
you're Aunt Emily wants

2339
01:15:53,053 --> 01:15:55,013
that handsome architect
to take her out on a date?

2340
01:15:55,055 --> 01:15:57,265
Well, she said she
didn't like him,

2341
01:15:57,307 --> 01:15:59,225
but you know what that means.

2342
01:15:59,267 --> 01:16:00,226
Thanks for the tip, kiddo.

2343
01:16:00,268 --> 01:16:01,227
Merry Christmas.

2344
01:16:01,269 --> 01:16:03,438
You too.

2345
01:16:03,480 --> 01:16:09,110
Oh, Trixie, who do we have next?

2346
01:16:09,152 --> 01:16:10,153
Trixie doesn't care.

2347
01:16:11,654 --> 01:16:14,491
Alan!

2348
01:16:14,532 --> 01:16:15,909
Pamela.

2349
01:16:21,706 --> 01:16:22,791
The storm.

2350
01:16:22,832 --> 01:16:23,583
How did you get here?

2351
01:16:23,625 --> 01:16:24,626
None of that matters now.

2352
01:16:24,668 --> 01:16:25,543
We're together.

2353
01:16:25,585 --> 01:16:29,172
That's all that's important.

2354
01:16:29,214 --> 01:16:31,341
What's the story there?

2355
01:16:31,383 --> 01:16:32,383
Christmas miracle.

2356
01:16:37,347 --> 01:16:38,574
Don't stay out
too late, you too.

2357
01:16:38,598 --> 01:16:40,183
We're waiting up for Santa.

2358
01:16:40,225 --> 01:16:41,726
I'm looking at my favorite star.

2359
01:16:44,020 --> 01:16:45,020
Oh.

2360
01:16:49,526 --> 01:16:51,486
Mom says I'm the official
photographer this year.

2361
01:16:51,528 --> 01:16:53,154
And you are doing
an excellent job.

2362
01:16:53,196 --> 01:16:54,196
Thanks, Emily.

2363
01:16:55,281 --> 01:16:58,326
Glory to the newborn king.

2364
01:17:04,124 --> 01:17:05,417
You're a true Melrose, Emily.

2365
01:17:05,458 --> 01:17:07,043
Your parents would be proud.

2366
01:17:07,085 --> 01:17:08,086
Merry Christmas.

2367
01:17:13,049 --> 01:17:14,092
How did you do it?

2368
01:17:14,134 --> 01:17:15,218
Do what?

2369
01:17:15,260 --> 01:17:16,540
There are no secrets from Santa.

2370
01:17:19,055 --> 01:17:21,516
How did you get Alan home
in time for Christmas?

2371
01:17:21,558 --> 01:17:23,852
My ex-boyfriend happens
to work for an airline.

2372
01:17:23,893 --> 01:17:27,564
So I called in a huge favor
and got him on the last flight

2373
01:17:27,605 --> 01:17:28,565
before the storm hit.

2374
01:17:28,606 --> 01:17:29,691
Your ex?

2375
01:17:29,733 --> 01:17:30,525
Thought you said
that guy was a jerk.

2376
01:17:30,567 --> 01:17:31,943
Oh, he is, totally.

2377
01:17:31,985 --> 01:17:33,778
Oh.

2378
01:17:33,820 --> 01:17:36,215
But even the biggest jerk is no
match for the Christmas spirit.

2379
01:17:36,239 --> 01:17:37,907
That give me goosebumps.

2380
01:17:37,949 --> 01:17:38,700
Is that strange?

2381
01:17:38,742 --> 01:17:40,076
Coming from you?

2382
01:17:40,118 --> 01:17:41,118
No.

2383
01:17:42,746 --> 01:17:45,582
So how was it?

2384
01:17:45,623 --> 01:17:46,791
Greatest night of my life.

2385
01:17:46,833 --> 01:17:47,792
Aww.

2386
01:17:47,834 --> 01:17:48,877
And it's not over.

2387
01:17:48,918 --> 01:17:50,628
I have a lot of
presents to deliver.

2388
01:17:50,670 --> 01:17:54,090
So in fact, do you know
where I can pick up some...

2389
01:17:54,132 --> 01:17:55,550
It's Bauhaus doll furniture.

2390
01:17:55,592 --> 01:17:57,802
I feel like the elves could
help with that probably.

2391
01:17:57,844 --> 01:18:00,555
That's a good idea.

2392
01:18:00,597 --> 01:18:02,057
I do have one more
request though.

2393
01:18:02,098 --> 01:18:04,059
Yeah, what's that?

2394
01:18:04,100 --> 01:18:06,412
How would you feel about going
on a date with an architect?

2395
01:18:06,436 --> 01:18:07,896
Oh, it depends.

2396
01:18:07,937 --> 01:18:08,730
Hm.

2397
01:18:08,772 --> 01:18:11,566
Is he handsome?

2398
01:18:11,608 --> 01:18:13,443
I know someone who has
a framed photo of him.

2399
01:18:13,485 --> 01:18:15,070
I can show you tomorrow
and you decide.

2400
01:18:15,111 --> 01:18:16,905
All right.

2401
01:18:16,946 --> 01:18:18,698
Walk me home?

2402
01:18:18,740 --> 01:18:20,367
I got to get back to the sleigh.

2403
01:18:20,408 --> 01:18:22,285
Reindeer are a handful
this time of night.

2404
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:37,800
It's Christmas.

2405
01:19:13,420 --> 01:19:14,796
Merry Christmas, honey!

2406
01:19:14,838 --> 01:19:15,838
Surprise!

2407
01:19:16,172 --> 01:19:17,172
Mom?

2408
01:19:17,507 --> 01:19:19,092
What are you doing here?

2409
01:19:19,134 --> 01:19:21,302
Well, Florida was fun,
but we couldn't be away

2410
01:19:21,344 --> 01:19:22,637
for the big day.

2411
01:19:22,679 --> 01:19:24,431
Oh, I am so happy
to see both of you.

2412
01:19:24,472 --> 01:19:25,432
Oh.

2413
01:19:25,473 --> 01:19:26,474
The house looks terrific.

2414
01:19:26,516 --> 01:19:27,851
You did a great job outside.

2415
01:19:27,892 --> 01:19:30,353
Yes, the lawn display
is very eclectic.

2416
01:19:30,395 --> 01:19:31,646
Thank you.

2417
01:19:31,688 --> 01:19:32,647
That's exactly what
I was going for.

2418
01:19:32,689 --> 01:19:34,107
It's all very familiar somehow.

2419
01:19:34,149 --> 01:19:34,649
Really?

2420
01:19:34,691 --> 01:19:35,233
Hm?

2421
01:19:35,275 --> 01:19:36,484
I don't know.

2422
01:19:36,526 --> 01:19:37,837
Like father like
daughter, I guess.

2423
01:19:37,861 --> 01:19:38,879
Did you remember to put
the key to the storage

2424
01:19:38,903 --> 01:19:40,905
unit back in the
shoe polish tin?

2425
01:19:40,947 --> 01:19:42,699
Wait, you knew?

2426
01:19:42,741 --> 01:19:45,660
I think it's funny
how after all these years

2427
01:19:45,702 --> 01:19:47,829
you still think you can
keep a secret from me.

2428
01:19:47,871 --> 01:19:49,247
Pfft.

2429
01:19:49,289 --> 01:19:50,248
How was your week, honey?

2430
01:19:50,290 --> 01:19:51,332
You know what?

2431
01:19:51,374 --> 01:19:51,833
It was exactly what I needed.

2432
01:19:51,875 --> 01:19:52,250
Really?

2433
01:19:52,292 --> 01:19:54,085
How so?

2434
01:19:54,127 --> 01:19:55,688
I just realized how amazing it
is what you guys started here.

2435
01:19:55,712 --> 01:19:57,648
And I was so proud to be
a part of it for one more

2436
01:19:57,672 --> 01:19:59,424
year, even if it was the last.

2437
01:19:59,466 --> 01:20:00,300
Is that it?

2438
01:20:00,342 --> 01:20:01,468
You're heading back?

2439
01:20:01,509 --> 01:20:02,969
I haven't decided yet.

2440
01:20:03,011 --> 01:20:04,947
But I am thinking about
looking for a place in town.

2441
01:20:04,971 --> 01:20:07,557
I can work from anywhere,
and I miss home.

2442
01:20:07,599 --> 01:20:09,726
That's the best news we've
heard in a long time.

2443
01:20:09,768 --> 01:20:10,685
Indeed.

2444
01:20:10,727 --> 01:20:11,728
How about you guys?

2445
01:20:11,770 --> 01:20:13,063
Did you find a place in Florida?

2446
01:20:13,104 --> 01:20:14,373
The good news is we
found a condo right next

2447
01:20:14,397 --> 01:20:15,815
to my brother's.

2448
01:20:15,857 --> 01:20:18,943
The bad news is their
HOA holiday regulations

2449
01:20:18,985 --> 01:20:19,778
are a total mess.

2450
01:20:19,819 --> 01:20:20,528
Oh.

2451
01:20:20,570 --> 01:20:22,030
But don't you worry.

2452
01:20:22,072 --> 01:20:23,031
Your father and I are
already drafting amendments.

2453
01:20:23,073 --> 01:20:24,324
Mm.

2454
01:20:24,366 --> 01:20:25,634
Gail and Albert
Melrose, just saving

2455
01:20:25,658 --> 01:20:27,035
Christmas one suburb at a time.

2456
01:20:27,077 --> 01:20:28,077
Mm-hmm.

2457
01:20:28,411 --> 01:20:29,996
Mm.

2458
01:20:30,038 --> 01:20:31,849
And thank you so much for
looking out for the place.

2459
01:20:31,873 --> 01:20:34,185
That was the best Christmas gift
you could have ever given us.

2460
01:20:34,209 --> 01:20:39,381
And now we want to give you
the best gift we can think of.

2461
01:20:39,422 --> 01:20:45,387
It's your keychain.

2462
01:20:45,428 --> 01:20:47,639
I don't get it.

2463
01:20:47,681 --> 01:20:51,309
Those are the keys to your
new home on Evergreen Lane.

2464
01:20:55,689 --> 01:20:58,316
Oh, are you serious?

2465
01:20:58,358 --> 01:21:00,443
If you want the
house, it's yours.

2466
01:21:00,485 --> 01:21:03,238
We can't imagine
it any other way.

2467
01:21:03,279 --> 01:21:05,532
I... I mean, yes.

2468
01:21:05,573 --> 01:21:06,116
I mean, yes!

2469
01:21:06,157 --> 01:21:07,157
Oh.

2470
01:21:08,451 --> 01:21:09,786
Oh, I love you guys so much.

2471
01:21:09,828 --> 01:21:10,787
Merry Christmas, honey.

2472
01:21:10,829 --> 01:21:11,913
Merry Christmas, honey.

2473
01:21:11,955 --> 01:21:13,164
I love...

2474
01:21:13,206 --> 01:21:15,166
Joy to the
world, the Lord has come.

2475
01:21:15,208 --> 01:21:16,584
Right on cue.

2476
01:21:16,626 --> 01:21:21,464
Let Earth receive her King.

2477
01:21:21,506 --> 01:21:26,678
Let every heart
prepare him room.

2478
01:21:26,720 --> 01:21:28,430
And heaven and nature sing.

2479
01:21:28,471 --> 01:21:29,431
Heaven and nature.

2480
01:21:29,472 --> 01:21:30,557
And heaven and naure sing.

2481
01:21:30,598 --> 01:21:31,808
And heaven and nature.

2482
01:21:31,850 --> 01:21:36,438
And heaven and heaven
and nature sing.

2483
01:21:36,479 --> 01:21:37,519
Merry Christmas, everyone!

2484
01:21:38,648 --> 01:21:39,691
Merry Christmas.

2485
01:21:39,733 --> 01:21:41,234
We've got a big day ahead of us.

2486
01:21:41,276 --> 01:21:42,527
But come on in for some cocoa.

2487
01:21:42,569 --> 01:21:44,946
We wish you a Merry Christmas.

2488
01:21:44,988 --> 01:21:47,365
We wish you a Merry Christmas.

2489
01:21:47,407 --> 01:21:48,950
Merry Christmas.

2490
01:21:48,992 --> 01:21:51,119
We wish you a Merry Christmas
and a happy New Year.

2491
01:21:51,161 --> 01:21:51,828
Hi, Bob.

2492
01:21:51,870 --> 01:21:52,829
Oh, I'm not singing.

2493
01:21:52,871 --> 01:21:55,123
OK, you stopped me.

2494
01:22:03,340 --> 01:22:04,924
Barely 36.

2495
01:22:04,966 --> 01:22:07,927
Well, Merry
Christmas to you too.

2496
01:22:07,969 --> 01:22:11,014
So you thinking about
taking their offer?

2497
01:22:11,056 --> 01:22:13,224
Well, I mean, the
house is amazing.

2498
01:22:13,266 --> 01:22:16,936
But kind of on the fence
about the neighborhood.

2499
01:22:16,978 --> 01:22:18,855
Yeah, yes, a lot of characters.

2500
01:22:18,897 --> 01:22:20,523
Yeah, the HOA is very strict.

2501
01:22:20,565 --> 01:22:22,365
Well, if you get in good
with their president,

2502
01:22:22,400 --> 01:22:23,502
he might cut you some slack.

2503
01:22:23,526 --> 01:22:25,236
I highly doubt that.

2504
01:22:25,278 --> 01:22:27,405
I took an oath to protect
this neighborhood.

2505
01:22:27,447 --> 01:22:28,490
And I'm going to honor it.

2506
01:22:28,531 --> 01:22:29,633
That just gave me goosebumps.

2507
01:22:29,657 --> 01:22:31,034
Is that strange?

2508
01:22:31,076 --> 01:22:32,077
Not at all.

2509
01:22:37,040 --> 01:22:38,291
You got a pen?

2510
01:22:38,333 --> 01:22:40,251
Always.

2511
01:22:40,293 --> 01:22:43,505
I have a citation
for you, Mr. President.

2512
01:22:43,546 --> 01:22:45,006
I'm sorry.

2513
01:22:45,048 --> 01:22:46,275
Is there some rule I
broke that I'm unaware of?

2514
01:22:46,299 --> 01:22:48,218
It's my own little flourish.

2515
01:22:48,259 --> 01:22:49,552
That's not how that works.

2516
01:22:49,594 --> 01:22:52,222
Punishment isn't too bad.

2517
01:22:52,263 --> 01:22:53,598
I'll be the judge of that.

2518
01:22:53,640 --> 01:23:00,689
This, I think I can handle.

2519
01:23:15,787 --> 01:23:17,330
Merry Christmas.

2520
01:23:17,372 --> 01:23:19,332
Merry Christmas.

2521
01:23:21,876 --> 01:23:24,129
So in the end,
Christmas didn't quite

2522
01:23:24,170 --> 01:23:27,882
turn out like I thought
it would It was better.

2523
01:23:27,924 --> 01:23:30,552
And I know one new resident who
has some ideas for next year's

2524
01:23:30,593 --> 01:23:32,303
celebration.

2525
01:23:32,345 --> 01:23:33,722
The countdown is on.

2526
01:23:33,763 --> 01:23:36,808
It's Christmas time, my dear.

2527
01:23:36,850 --> 01:23:38,852
You could feel it in the air.

2528
01:23:41,646 --> 01:23:46,443
Singing songs and
spreading Christmas cheer.

2529
01:23:47,944 --> 01:23:50,613
Kissing under mistletoe.

2530
01:23:50,655 --> 01:23:51,698
Kissing.

2531
01:23:51,740 --> 01:23:53,616
Never want to let you go.

2532
01:23:53,658 --> 01:23:54,743
Never going to let you.

2533
01:23:54,784 --> 01:23:56,953
At least one thing is clear.

2534
01:23:56,995 --> 01:23:58,246
Ooh-ooh.

2535
01:23:58,288 --> 01:24:01,458
We can't wait to do it
all again next year.
