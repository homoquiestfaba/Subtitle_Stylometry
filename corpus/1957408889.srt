00:09:20,821 --> 00:09:21,822
And...

186
00:09:25,086 --> 00:09:26,740
This is what they're willing
to pay.

187
00:09:28,393 --> 00:09:29,394
Wow.

188
00:09:32,397 --> 00:09:33,485
Hmm.

189
00:09:33,529 --> 00:09:35,618
People want to see you again.

190
00:09:35,662 --> 00:09:38,099
They really are something
when they're on the same page.

191
00:09:38,142 --> 00:09:41,711
Well we were when your mom let
me take care of business.

192
00:09:41,755 --> 00:09:44,584
More like micromanage my life.

193
00:09:44,627 --> 00:09:48,022
I just wanted you to share the
gifts God gave you.

194
00:09:48,065 --> 00:09:51,765
Not let them fall like pine
needles off a Christmas tree

195
00:09:51,808 --> 00:09:53,593
just because you made
a big mistake.

196
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:00,730
So, tell me a little bit
about yourself.

197
00:10:00,774 --> 00:10:02,384
Do you play an instrument or?

198
00:10:02,427 --> 00:10:05,474
I mean I could teach you some
of the songs we have.

199
00:10:05,517 --> 00:10:08,346
RILEY: I'm not much of a singer
but I love playing.

200
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:09,391
That's nice.

201
00:10:09,434 --> 00:10:10,784
Okay, you know what?

202
00:10:10,827 --> 00:10:13,395
This has all been a lot.

203
00:10:13,438 --> 00:10:15,919
I think it's about time
for Riley and I to go home.

204
00:10:15,963 --> 00:10:17,323
Not many people get a
second chance

205
00:10:17,355 --> 00:10:18,681
to share their gift with
the world.

206
00:10:18,705 --> 00:10:20,204
At least agree to come by
my office tomorrow.

207
00:10:20,228 --> 00:10:21,553
We can go over the rest
of the details.

208
00:10:21,577 --> 00:10:22,534
I...

209
00:10:22,578 --> 00:10:24,145
Mom, you have to.

210
00:10:27,888 --> 00:10:29,106
Fine.

211
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:32,370
I will come by to listen
to the details.

212
00:10:32,414 --> 00:10:36,548
But seriously, Riley, it's time
for us to go home.

213
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:38,526
Good to see ya again, Ashlyn.

214
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:40,422
ASHLYN: Yeah, you too, Bret.

215
00:10:40,465 --> 00:10:42,206
RILEY: Bye Grandma.

216

[gentle music]

217
00:10:48,735 --> 00:10:50,432
Don't even try.

218
00:10:51,868 --> 00:10:53,348
Would you get my things?

219
00:10:53,391 --> 00:10:55,350
I'm gonna go sit in the truck.

221
00:11:02,792 --> 00:11:04,011
Riley Rose!

222
00:11:04,054 --> 00:11:05,708
Breakfast is ready,
come on down!

223
00:11:09,016 --> 00:11:10,974
Okay, I'm dying to know,
how does it look?

224
00:11:11,018 --> 00:11:12,019
What do you think?

225
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:14,412
It's hard to mess up breakfast

226
00:11:14,456 --> 00:11:16,545
so I wouldn't get too
high on the hog.

227
00:11:16,588 --> 00:11:18,547
I will take that as
a compliment.

228
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:20,114
My early Christmas gift to you.

229
00:11:20,157 --> 00:11:23,639
Speaking of Christmas,
what do you want this year?

230
00:11:24,771 --> 00:11:27,164
So for once I actually know
what I want.

231
00:11:27,208 --> 00:11:29,471
Okay, let's hear it.

232
00:11:29,514 --> 00:11:31,212
Don't worry, it's not expensive.

233
00:11:31,255 --> 00:11:32,213
Well that's good.

234
00:11:32,256 --> 00:11:33,518
Okay, what is it?

235
00:11:33,562 --> 00:11:34,694
I want Grandma.

236
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:40,264
Uh, what do you mean?

237
00:11:40,308 --> 00:11:43,441
I want to spend Christmas
with Grandma.

238
00:11:43,485 --> 00:11:46,531
I just want us to be a
family, that's all.

239
00:11:46,575 --> 00:11:48,446
There's a lotta history there.

240
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:49,926
Well yeah, she's your mom.

241
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:52,581
Yeah but it's a lot more
complicated than that.

242
00:11:52,624 --> 00:11:55,584
You always tell me how
short life is

243
00:11:55,627 --> 00:11:58,282
and how I should chase
my dreams.

244
00:11:58,326 --> 00:12:00,197
This is all I want this year.

245
00:12:04,636 --> 00:12:07,030

Okay, are you ready for
your warm ups?

249
00:12:32,577 --> 00:12:35,450
Look, you're an internet star.

250
00:12:35,493 --> 00:12:37,408
Well that's a new one,
even for me.

251
00:12:39,715 --> 00:12:41,543
That is a lot of views!

252
00:12:41,586 --> 00:12:42,544
Yeah, it is.

253
00:12:42,587 --> 00:12:44,633
How do you get all those views?

254
00:12:44,676 --> 00:12:46,940
Oh, you know,
when people share it.

255
00:12:48,593 --> 00:12:49,986
Share.

256
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:52,423
That's a new concept.

257
00:12:52,467 --> 00:12:54,948
[bright music]

258
00:12:56,906 --> 00:12:57,864
How you holding up, Bon?

259
00:12:57,907 --> 00:12:59,866
That was some stunt you pulled.

260
00:13:00,823 --> 00:13:01,955
I shoulda told ya.

261
00:13:01,998 --> 00:13:03,367
But I knew if I did,
you wouldn't show.

262
00:13:03,391 --> 00:13:05,654
She broke my heart when she quit
the Roses

263
00:13:05,697 --> 00:13:08,091
and ran off with that Beau.

264
00:13:08,135 --> 00:13:09,397
I know.

265
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,070
We had such a good thing going
and she just,

266
00:13:11,094 --> 00:13:13,531
she left for some hair brained
idea that...

267
00:13:13,575 --> 00:13:14,619
Love.

268
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:16,752
People do some crazy things.

269
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:18,058
Risk a lot for love.

270
00:13:18,101 --> 00:13:19,363
Um hmm.

271
00:13:19,407 --> 00:13:22,323
And once his meal ticket
dried up, he was gone.

272
00:13:22,366 --> 00:13:23,454
Just like I said he'd be.

273
00:13:23,498 --> 00:13:25,108
I know that too.

274
00:13:25,152 --> 00:13:26,216
I was there through it all.

275
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,241
Remember?

276
00:13:27,981 --> 00:13:29,286
I know.

277
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:31,462
You were a faithful manager
and friend.

278
00:13:32,768 --> 00:13:34,465
But if we do this again

279
00:13:34,509 --> 00:13:36,598
it's got to be different.

280
00:13:36,641 --> 00:13:38,078
ASHLYN: You can say that again.

281
00:13:38,121 --> 00:13:41,124
Oh, I love that we agree
on something.

282
00:13:42,517 --> 00:13:44,867
I didn't give ya a proper
hello last night.

283
00:13:44,911 --> 00:13:45,868
ASHLYN: Hey Bret.

284
00:13:45,912 --> 00:13:46,869
Good to see ya.

285
00:13:46,913 --> 00:13:47,957
You too.

286
00:13:48,001 --> 00:13:50,264
Okay ladies, to your corners.

287
00:13:56,618 --> 00:13:59,969
So, have you given some thought
to the proposal?

288
00:14:00,013 --> 00:14:02,232
Question, what exactly do they
want for this offer?

289
00:14:02,276 --> 00:14:03,625
A Christmas EP.

290
00:14:03,668 --> 00:14:06,019
Two classic Christmas songs
and one original.

291
00:14:06,062 --> 00:14:07,411
A new one?

292
00:14:07,455 --> 00:14:09,761
This says we only have
a few weeks.

293
00:14:09,805 --> 00:14:11,154
Yep.

294
00:14:11,198 --> 00:14:13,113
They want to release the songs
on Christmas Eve.

295
00:14:14,766 --> 00:14:15,898
[Bonnie sighs]

296
00:14:15,942 --> 00:14:17,552
I think it's a great offer.

297
00:14:17,595 --> 00:14:21,469
Especially considering your
illustrious solo careers.

298
00:14:21,512 --> 00:14:22,513
Oh!

299
00:14:24,515 --> 00:14:25,473
Okay fine.

300
00:14:25,516 --> 00:14:26,691
I'll do it.

301
00:14:26,735 --> 00:14:28,650
But then I go my way.

302
00:14:30,478 --> 00:14:31,566
And I go mine.

303
00:14:32,393 --> 00:14:33,655
Great.

304
00:14:33,698 --> 00:14:35,067
So I've lined you up with
Smith Carter.

305
00:14:35,091 --> 00:14:36,721
He's the hottest producer in
the industry right now.

306
00:14:36,745 --> 00:14:38,027
I've also got you a photo shoot
for the promo kit

307
00:14:38,051 --> 00:14:39,487
and a one to one interview.

308
00:14:40,967 --> 00:14:41,924
Wow.

309
00:14:41,968 --> 00:14:43,534
That didn't take long.

I might be grayer but I can
still make things happen.

311
00:14:46,973 --> 00:14:49,279
Well I think you look
distinguished.

00:14:49,323 --> 00:14:50,324

00:15:36,283 --> 00:15:37,937
You're here to keep these
two in line?

no promises.

332
00:15:42,202 --> 00:15:43,657
So what do you have planned
for your original?

333

I can only imagine what you have
after all this time.

We don't actually have anything
written yet.

Oh, okay.

336
00:15:52,995 --> 00:15:54,779
Then let's tackle the
other two songs.

337
00:15:54,823 --> 00:15:56,433
What classics have you chosen?

338
00:15:57,304 --> 00:15:59,567
Well, we haven't, yet.

339
00:16:00,742 --> 00:16:03,527
We could always do
"Little Drummer Boy".

340
00:16:03,571 --> 00:16:06,704
[sighs] That's been done
to death.

341
00:16:06,748 --> 00:16:09,229
Then by all means, why
don't you choose.

00:16:09,272 --> 00:16:11,492
Smith, would you please put
us out of our misery

343
00:16:11,535 --> 00:16:13,015
and choose a song?

344
00:16:13,059 --> 00:16:15,452
Anything but the
"Little Drummer Boy".

00:16:15,496 --> 00:16:18,629

"Hark the Herald Angels Sing"?

00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:49,799

00:35:49,843 --> 00:35:51,888
So, I'll text you tomorrow.

732
00:35:55,501 --> 00:35:56,502

734
00:36:00,941 --> 00:36:01,942
Cool.

00:36:03,726 --> 00:36:04,858
See ya then.

00:36:32,929 --> 00:36:33,930
You made it.

00:36:33,974 --> 00:36:35,497
I did.

This was not what I
was expecting.

you to meet.

You're in good hands.

Nice to meet you both.

750
00:37:06,746 --> 00:37:08,095
I should get up there.

751

Don't want them to start a
riot if I start late.

752

Good luck.

and it would always make
her so happy

00:38:37,489 --> 00:38:39,317
when I'd visit and play.

a Christmas tree.

of community.

What resonates with me most is
just how selfless she was.

811
00:39:45,513 --> 00:39:46,949
She'd always remind me
to consider

812
00:39:46,993 --> 00:39:48,318
what the person next to me
was going through

813
00:39:48,342 --> 00:39:51,171

in my own life.

She loved, I mean really
loved the Roses.

Every Christmas we would listen
to your albums on repeat.

819

She'd be crazed to know I'm
producing your album.

That's so sweet.

I'm just happy

822
00:40:12,497 --> 00:40:14,542
that we could be a part of your
memories with her.

823
00:40:14,586 --> 00:40:16,022
Yeah you know I guess
I just learned

824
00:40:16,065 --> 00:40:18,241
to appreciate what you have
while you have it.

the box every year

tangled up and knotted

are broken

can change it.

I'm just saying.

00:42:57,618 --> 00:42:59,620
Just saying that you have to
have your two cents

00:42:59,664 --> 00:43:01,448
on everything in my life.

892
00:43:03,015 --> 00:43:06,409
Actually you are both wearing
the wrong shade of lipstick.

893
00:43:06,453 --> 00:43:11,284
And you are not highlighted or
contoured nearly enough.

894

I had no idea I needed to
brighten my eyes.

00:43:26,212 --> 00:43:29,345
And this is not a color
I would normally use.

I would say you're my
go to girl.

00:43:37,353 --> 00:43:40,705
But don't forget how beautiful
you are without makeup.

903
00:43:41,662 --> 00:43:43,272
It's self expression, Grandma.

904
00:43:43,316 --> 00:43:46,362
It's empowering to choose how
I want to show myself

01:13:53,777 --> 01:13:56,606
I've been taking you for granted

1447
01:13:56,649 --> 01:13:58,869
and acting like a spoiled child.

1448
01:14:02,350 --> 01:14:03,569
We've had too many highs

1449
01:14:03,613 --> 01:14:05,571
to let one low get in the way
of a good thing.

1450
01:14:07,921 --> 01:14:09,227
[sighs]

1451
01:14:09,270 --> 01:14:11,751
I have been so afraid of
getting hurt again

1452
01:14:12,665 --> 01:14:15,407
that I've let it come
between us.

1453
01:14:15,451 --> 01:14:17,888
[sighs] I wanted to be tough.

1454
01:14:19,063 --> 01:14:20,064
Not afraid.

1455
01:14:24,460 --> 01:14:25,461
What?

1456
01:14:26,200 --> 01:14:27,375
You are tough.

1457
01:14:29,073 --> 01:14:31,945
And admitting you were afraid,
just made you even tougher.

1458
01:14:36,123 --> 01:14:37,231
I brought something for you.

1459
01:14:37,255 --> 01:14:38,125
Oh you didn't need to
get me anything

1460
01:14:38,169 --> 01:14:39,170
for crying out loud.

1461
01:14:40,214 --> 01:14:42,521
Well, I kinda did.

1462
01:14:42,565 --> 01:14:44,741
It's the least I could do.

1463
01:14:44,784 --> 01:14:47,047
You gave me that beautiful song,
label loves it.

1464
01:14:47,091 --> 01:14:49,136
They just played it on WZPZ.

1465
01:14:49,180 --> 01:14:51,008
Yeah, that's good.

1466
01:14:51,051 --> 01:14:52,009
That's good.

1467
01:14:52,052 --> 01:14:53,227
Have a look.

1468
01:14:53,271 --> 01:14:54,707
I owe you one more apology.

1469
01:14:59,886 --> 01:15:01,932
I almost lost everything again.

1470
01:15:03,803 --> 01:15:05,065
But it made me realize

1471
01:15:05,109 --> 01:15:06,850
what was in front of me
the whole time.

1472
01:15:08,504 --> 01:15:11,507
You're the only man who has
never let me down.

1473
01:15:13,683 --> 01:15:15,902
It has been my absolute pleasure
all along.

1474
01:15:17,077 --> 01:15:18,122
I love you, Bret.

1475
01:15:19,515 --> 01:15:21,386
I just hope I'm not too late.

1476
01:15:24,389 --> 01:15:26,957
I've loved you for 22
Christmases.

1477
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:28,959
Nothing was gonna get in
the way of 23.

1478
01:15:41,362 --> 01:15:43,060
What took you so long?

1479
01:15:44,540 --> 01:15:46,542
I've been told I'm stubborn.

1480
01:15:46,585 --> 01:15:47,585
You don't say?

1481
01:15:51,329 --> 01:15:54,419
Oh hey, I didn't expect you
back so early.

1482
01:15:56,160 --> 01:15:58,379
So, how'd it go?

1483
01:15:58,423 --> 01:15:59,424
It was good.

1484
01:16:00,860 --> 01:16:03,341
He flies back tonight for a
Christmas show tomorrow.

1485
01:16:03,384 --> 01:16:04,647
Oh, wow.

1486
01:16:05,648 --> 01:16:07,519
So what'd you do?

1487
01:16:07,563 --> 01:16:10,348
We ate and we talked.

1488
01:16:10,391 --> 01:16:13,394
And we listened to your song,
Mom, it was awesome.

1489
01:16:13,438 --> 01:16:15,440
I think he was jealous.

1490
01:16:15,483 --> 01:16:16,789
Oh really?

1491
01:16:16,833 --> 01:16:18,574
And he gave me these.

1492
01:16:19,444 --> 01:16:22,882
I think he thinks I'm a drummer.

1493
01:16:24,275 --> 01:16:28,279
Okay, well maybe it's wishful
thinking.

1494
01:16:28,322 --> 01:16:30,498
He told me he's gonna try
and get better

1495
01:16:30,542 --> 01:16:31,630
at keeping in touch.

1496
01:16:31,674 --> 01:16:34,502
But I'm not holding my breath.

1497
01:16:37,462 --> 01:16:39,377
And he wanted me to
give you this.

1498
01:16:40,334 --> 01:16:41,379
Wow.

1499
01:16:45,862 --> 01:16:48,125
I'm sure he's gonna do his
best, sweetheart.

1500
01:16:49,387 --> 01:16:52,303
Just know that you always have
me and your grandmother.

1501
01:16:54,174 --> 01:16:56,133
You brought this family
back together.

1502
01:16:56,176 --> 01:16:58,788
You're our Christmas miracle.

1503
01:16:58,831 --> 01:16:59,876
I know.

1504
01:16:59,919 --> 01:17:01,573
[both laughing]

1505
01:17:01,617 --> 01:17:05,272
Speaking of which,
it is Christmas Eve.

1506
01:17:05,316 --> 01:17:06,796
Would you like to open
your present

1507
01:17:06,839 --> 01:17:08,319
or are you over that now?

1508
01:17:08,362 --> 01:17:10,060
No way, I want to.

1509
01:17:10,103 --> 01:17:11,757
Okay, well there is one gift

1510
01:17:11,801 --> 01:17:13,454
that I would like to give you

1511
01:17:13,498 --> 01:17:16,066
before we go over to your
grandma's in the morning.

1512
01:17:16,109 --> 01:17:18,372
Okay, you're totally not gonna
guess what it is.

1513
01:17:19,896 --> 01:17:20,897
Okay, you ready?

1514

Do you like it?

1517
01:17:32,169 --> 01:17:33,736
RILEY: Thank you.

1518
01:17:34,824 --> 01:17:36,303
I love it.

1519
01:17:36,347 --> 01:17:40,003
Well I figured you've been
playing mine for so long

1520
01:17:40,046 --> 01:17:41,787
it's about time that you
deserved one

1521
01:17:41,831 --> 01:17:43,702
of your very own.

1522
01:17:43,746 --> 01:17:44,746

Mom.

1525
01:17:51,667 --> 01:17:53,973
Okay, I just had to have
one mom moment.

1526
01:17:54,974 --> 01:17:56,323
I love you too.
