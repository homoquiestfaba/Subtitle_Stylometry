00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:03,883
Friends we're in the middle of a war.

4
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:08,918
This is a war between
good God-fearing folks

5
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,108
like you and I,

6
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:12,700
and those on the side of Satan.

7
00:01:14,438 --> 00:01:16,135
You know, just last week,

8
00:01:16,177 --> 00:01:18,678
I was with my children, my young children

9
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,018
out of the moon

10
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:22,818
trying to have a nice time with my family.

11
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:25,758
And I look over to the concession line.

12
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:28,253
You and there are two men holding hands.

13
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,808
Two men, mind you just carrying
on like a normal couple.

14
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:35,248
Like, there's nothing wrong with it.

15
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:36,593
Bunch of sickos.

16
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:39,381
Now I ask you,

17
00:01:39,423 --> 00:01:43,228
should we let these people run
around and do what they want?

18
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:45,598
Should we let these people get to us

19
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,018
and get to a our children?

20
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:49,318
Because that's what they'll do.

21
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,151
- They'll stop...
- Jackson.

22
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:51,988
On nothing to take us down with...

23
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:52,821
Where's that sister your?

24
00:01:52,863 --> 00:01:56,933
[TV] They'll stop nothing
to infect us with their sin.

25
00:02:00,619 --> 00:02:02,702
[coughs]

26
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,548
Folks, it is up to us to make sure that

27
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:12,588
our children are not practicing sin.

28
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:15,663
Our very livelihood depends on this.

29
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:18,088
Is there some reason that she's

30
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:19,279
not down here with the rest of the family.

31
00:02:19,321 --> 00:02:22,118
[TV] Hanging on us, if we
raise a bunch of sinners.

32
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,498
She may not be feeling well.

00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:25,486
[TV] Defy His rules and commands...

34
00:02:25,528 --> 00:02:26,319
I'll go check on her.

35
00:02:26,361 --> 00:02:28,508
No, do you think we'll
despair the fires of hell?

36
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:30,218
No.

37
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:33,558
I say if we wanna taste that
sweet promise of heaven,

38
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,451
we'll have to make a few
sacrifices along the way.

39
00:02:36,493 --> 00:02:37,472
Amen.

Hey.

44
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,647
Sweetie, are you okay?

[sobs]

46
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:13,298
Well, Robbie's about to fire up the grill.

47
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:14,645
Are you hungry?

48
00:04:14,687 --> 00:04:16,347
I'll be down in a minute.

49
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:17,222
Okay?

50
00:04:40,723 --> 00:04:42,048
[Jackson] You didn't
have to gimme these ma?

51
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:44,258
Well, it's not every day that your son

52
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:45,628
makes the honor roll.

53
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:47,253
We are so proud of you.

54
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:56,928
Robbie.

55
00:04:56,970 --> 00:04:58,348
You not to give me this.

56
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:00,638
You just got me that
fishing pole last week.

57
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:03,168
Hey, forget about this Robbie business.

58
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:05,223
It's gonna be dad by next Sunday.

59
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:08,640
Might as well start getting used to it.

60
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:11,723
You too, Emma.

61
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:17,928
Your brother tells me that you
were out with some colorful

62
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:19,443
characters last night.

63
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:24,618
Are you still running around
with that Rachel McKenny?

64
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:29,660
I hear she's a bit of a
loose girl, big into drugs,

65
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,988
lots of boyfriends and that mother.

66
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:33,973
So what?

67
00:05:39,276 --> 00:05:40,193
I like her.

68
00:05:47,853 --> 00:05:49,988
I don't know if your mother allows

69
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:52,448
that kind of talk at their dinner table,

70
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:55,858
but that's not something that's gonna be

71
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:57,363
happening in this house.

72
00:05:58,490 --> 00:05:59,390
Do you understand?

73
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:10,033
She's sorry.

74
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,306
You're sorry, aren't you Emma?

00:06:13,348 --> 00:06:16,181
[dramatic music]

76
00:06:29,303 --> 00:06:30,720
I'm sorry, sir.

77
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:37,548
You know what this family needs,

78
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:39,698
is a celebration.

79
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:41,040
I'm gonna go cut the cake.

80
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:54,258
So Jackson, maybe you should
start tutoring your sister,

81
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:55,608
whatever teachers called last week

82
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:57,518
and her grades are slipping.

83
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,828
You know what, I think I'll go help mom

84
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:00,703
in the kitchen.

85
00:07:07,905 --> 00:07:09,928
[taps]

86
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:11,918
That apartment we were
looking at last year in Madison

87
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:12,758
is for rent again.

88
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,938
I saw it last night when
I drove by it with Rachel.

89
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:18,798
I don't think Robbie's
looking to move anytime soon.

90
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:23,028
No, I'm meant just a place for us to go.

91
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:25,798
Just you, me and Jackson.

92
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,738
Sweetie, what is it with the two of you?

93
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:30,728
I thought you liked him.

94
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:32,080
It's just...

95
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,730
I just think you could do better.

96
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:36,788
Sweetie.

97
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:39,938
Robby takes care of me, of us.

98
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:43,568
We don't have to worry about
when we're going to eat

99
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:45,968
or where we're going to sleep at night.

100
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:50,008
And I mean, it's not
like there are hundreds

101
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:53,408
of men wanting to marry a
woman my age with two kids,

102
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:54,241
you know?

103
00:07:54,283 --> 00:07:55,238
He's just so...

104
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,978
Okay, Emma, I am not going to have

105
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:58,370
this conversation with you.

106
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:03,898
We are lucky that Robby
walked into our lives

107
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:05,418
because without him,

108
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:06,980
we wouldn't have the church

109
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:09,208
and with the church,

110
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:11,563
we will always have a family.

111
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,573
We already had a family, mom.

112
00:08:19,168 --> 00:08:20,678
You know what?

113
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,693
Why don't you finish
slicing and I'll serve.

114
00:08:36,661 --> 00:08:38,578

[dramatic music]

117
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,568
Hi, sweetie.

118
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:05,798
Do you have any trash?

119
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,369
No, I'm good.

120
00:09:07,411 --> 00:09:12,411
Okay.

121
00:09:47,192 --> 00:09:50,204
[dramatic music]

122
00:09:50,246 --> 00:09:53,477
When were you gonna tell me about this?

123
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:54,765
I was just trying to figure out a plan.

124
00:09:54,807 --> 00:09:55,598
I'm gonna have to tell Robbie.

125
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,473
No, please don't.

126
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:01,918
I've been doing some research
on how much abortion costs.

127
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:04,068
You wanna kill your baby?

128
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:04,918
Come on mom.

129
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,478
It's not like you didn't
have a couple of your own

130
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,467
back in the day.

131
00:10:07,509 --> 00:10:09,509
[slaps]

132
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:14,303
Why can't you just be more
like your brother, Emma?

133
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:17,733
Just drama free.

134
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:20,420
Give me that cell phone.

135
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:26,703
You will not be getting this
back for at least a week.

136
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:30,538
Now, go brush your teeth.

137
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:33,873
Because besides meals, you
aren't leaving this bedroom.

138
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:36,363
Or we can lock.

139
00:10:39,012 --> 00:10:41,762
[dramatic music]

140
00:10:58,011 --> 00:11:00,844
[Robbie quarrels]

141
00:11:16,793 --> 00:11:18,343
[Robbie] Slot for a daughter.

142
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,174
We've gotta do something about this.

143
00:11:25,216 --> 00:11:28,049
[dramatic music]

144
00:11:41,389 --> 00:11:43,056
What did you do now?

145
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:47,318
They always fight after
you've done something.

146
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,278
Why are you giving him such a hard time?

147
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,223
Why do you like him so much?

148
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,288
[water showers]

149
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:56,078
He comes to my football games.

150
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:59,098
Buys me new shoes helps
me with my homework.

151
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:01,308
Yeah, but haven't you noticed

152
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:04,278
how mom's changed since she met him?

153
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,111
I mean, come on.

154
00:12:05,153 --> 00:12:07,248
She wasn't exactly cooking
us home cooked meals

155
00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:09,558
and going to Bible retreats.

156
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,708
We were lucky to get a
soggy bag of McDonald's

157
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:12,853
at the end of the day.

158
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:16,688
Well, before we went
to go live with Grammy

159
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:18,180
and all this religious stuff.

160
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:22,168
Is there something wrong
with being religious?

161
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:26,258
Grammy was, your dad
was, maybe mom was too.

162
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:28,128
You know, for some reason,

163
00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:30,091
I don't think mom stuck
around long enough to find out

164
00:12:30,133 --> 00:12:32,300
what their favorite Bible verses were.

165
00:12:33,526 --> 00:12:36,026
[tap showers]

166
00:12:40,651 --> 00:12:43,958
You don't think it's
cool having a dad around?

167
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,008
Someone who will be there for
our graduations or weddings.

168
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:49,088
Awful, wedding.

169
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:50,328
Are you in that cute guy

170
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:53,088
from the speech and
debate team still talking?

171
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:54,558
That's gross.

172
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,588
Why, I thought you
two were cute together.

173
00:12:56,630 --> 00:12:57,793
You still talk to him.

174
00:12:58,640 --> 00:12:59,740
Why would I do that?

175
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:02,078
That's a sin.

176
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:02,953
Come on.

177
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:12,683
You know, Jackson,

178
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:16,923
You used to laugh a lot more
before Robbie was around.

179
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,953
Be nice to hear you laugh again.

180
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,058
Come on, Jackson.

181
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:29,023
You used to always be on my side.

182
00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:31,721
Why can't you be on my side here?

183
00:13:31,763 --> 00:13:33,688
Because being on your side always seems

184
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:35,507
to get me into trouble.

185
00:13:41,448 --> 00:13:44,198
[dramatic music]

186
00:14:00,144 --> 00:14:02,644
[phone dings]

187
00:14:06,785 --> 00:14:08,593
[typing]

188
00:14:08,635 --> 00:14:11,135
[phone dings]

189
00:14:24,955 --> 00:14:27,538
[upbeat music]

190
00:14:41,316 --> 00:14:43,848
[Tammy] That's really big.

191
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:45,888
They caught this right by that cabin

192
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:46,858
that we're going to tomorrow.

193
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:47,733
Mm.

194
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:50,835
I'm gonna go show this to Jackson.

195
00:14:50,877 --> 00:14:52,668
And I think he'd get a big kick out of it.

196
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:53,543
Hubby!

197
00:14:57,093 --> 00:14:59,926
[dramatic music]

198
00:15:28,693 --> 00:15:29,776
What is that?

199
00:15:30,677 --> 00:15:31,510
It's a.

200
00:15:52,684 --> 00:15:55,485
I thought I was the only one here.

201
00:15:55,527 --> 00:15:57,248
Oh, I was just looking for some Advil.

202
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:58,590
I'll leave you with alone.

203
00:15:59,953 --> 00:16:02,703
[dramatic music]

204
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:27,557
[panting]

205
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:47,053
Jackson.

206
00:16:50,005 --> 00:16:52,373
Do you know that? What you did is wrong?

207
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:59,640
Boys like that God doesn't love them.

208
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:05,420
What are you doing outta your room?

209
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:08,543
I was just trying to get some water.

210
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,563
What's going on.

211
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,230
Last night, we...

212
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:24,108
Robbie found your brother

213
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:28,393
engaging an adult
conversation with another boy.

214
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,168
So what he likes boys.

215
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:32,453
What's the big deal.

216
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:34,481
Come on mom.

217
00:17:34,523 --> 00:17:36,458
I got, that was a given
after he was Cinderella

218
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,514
for Halloween in second grade.

219
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:38,347
[bang]

220
00:17:38,389 --> 00:17:40,973
Do you think your brother's
eternal damnation is funny?

221
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:45,628
Do you think it's
something to laugh about?

222
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:46,808
Just because you're going to hell.

223
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:48,678
Doesn't mean you're gonna
take the rest of us with you.

224
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,163
Robbie, stop it.

225
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,658
You didn't discipline these kids enough.

226
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,053
That's what's wrong with me.

227
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:21,658
So are we eating before fishing

228
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:25,377
or are we stopping to
get something on the...

229
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,288
Where would we go?

230
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:38,153
What would I do for a living?

231
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:42,913
I could try to get my job
back at that olive garden.

232
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,718
Now I don't think I'm allowed

233
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:48,297
within 500 feet of that place.

234
00:18:48,339 --> 00:18:49,758
You figure out later,

235
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,758
as long as we're a wait from him,

236
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:55,158
look, we could just get in
the car and drive anywhere.

237
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,288
I don't care if we have to
sleep in the cardboard box.

238
00:18:58,330 --> 00:18:59,730
It means that much to you.

239
00:19:02,911 --> 00:19:04,003
I'm so sorry.

240
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:09,568
I am so sorry that you kids got
stuck with the big old dope,

241
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:11,138
like me for your mom.

242
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:13,218
You'd be so much better off without me.

243
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:15,128
Mom. Don't say that.

244
00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:18,333
Tammy, are you making lunch?

245
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,151
Yes.

246
00:19:20,193 --> 00:19:22,288
Yeah, I'll be there in a second.

247
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:23,948
Hey, listen.

248
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:25,738
We'll figure it out later, okay?

249
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:26,680
Let's just go eat.

250
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,973
Remember what I said, little girl?

251
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:46,603
One word.

252
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:57,853
Don't want anything to happen.

253
00:19:58,910 --> 00:19:59,743
Do we?

254
00:20:04,877 --> 00:20:06,288
[breaths heavily]

255
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:09,163
[dramatic music]

256
00:20:44,257 --> 00:20:45,090
Hmm.

257
00:20:46,983 --> 00:20:47,774
[door squeaks]

258
00:20:47,816 --> 00:20:50,233
[slow music]

259
00:21:06,183 --> 00:21:07,943
It's, time to wake up, sweetie.

260
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:14,617
Where are we going?

261
00:21:17,568 --> 00:21:19,985
[slow music]

262
00:22:20,530 --> 00:22:23,113
[upbeat music]

263
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:03,593
We've got the whole place to ourselves.

264
00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:09,393
Not that all the boys at
school are wild about you.

265
00:23:12,367 --> 00:23:15,117
[horrible music]

266
00:23:16,317 --> 00:23:17,519
Don't you wanna know what to do

267
00:23:17,561 --> 00:23:18,961
when you meet the right boy?

268
00:23:21,189 --> 00:23:24,439
You don't wanna be embarrassed, do you?

269
00:23:28,301 --> 00:23:30,218
I know what boys, like,

270
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:34,148
I can show you if you like.

271
00:23:34,190 --> 00:23:36,940
[horrible music]

272
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:50,503
Well, you must be Emma.

273
00:23:51,390 --> 00:23:52,758
I'm Mary Esther.

274
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,573
Welcome to Abraham house.

275
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:57,088
Where's my mom.

276
00:23:57,130 --> 00:23:58,533
I'm right here, sweetie.

277
00:24:00,642 --> 00:24:02,368
I'll leave you three.

278
00:24:02,410 --> 00:24:03,423
Talk this over.

279
00:24:04,542 --> 00:24:05,542
Thank you.

280
00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:08,783
Mom, what is this place?

281
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:11,903
You guys trust me, right?

282
00:24:13,842 --> 00:24:17,033
And you know that. I love
you both so, so much.

283
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:21,943
And we can't,

284
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,009
we can't let you go to hell.

285
00:24:27,051 --> 00:24:28,106
[laughs]

286
00:24:28,148 --> 00:24:28,981
Go to hell.

287
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:32,298
It's okay, baby.

288
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:34,358
We can fix this.

289
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:37,968
We can fix this all together, okay?

290
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:40,598
If you just do what you're supposed to do.

291
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,235
What is it we be doing?

292
00:24:42,277 --> 00:24:44,848
You just have to listen to Mary Esther.

293
00:24:44,890 --> 00:24:49,088
She works for the church and
she knows how things are done.

294
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:50,773
Did he put you up to this?

295
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:57,008
I called your school and I
told him that we had a family

296
00:24:57,050 --> 00:25:00,888
emergency and nobody
has to know about this.

297
00:25:00,930 --> 00:25:03,078
It can just be our secret in.

298
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,853
There's nothing wrong with us, mom.

299
00:25:08,391 --> 00:25:09,691
What about you, Jackson?

300
00:25:10,690 --> 00:25:12,775
Do you think that you could be a good boy

301
00:25:12,817 --> 00:25:15,183
and you could mind all of the rules?

302
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:22,099
Well, if it makes you happy.

303
00:25:22,141 --> 00:25:23,458
Maybe it'll work.

304
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:25,563
And if Robbie thinks it'll work.

305
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:28,673
Yeah.

306
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:31,113
So what about you, Emma?

307
00:25:32,543 --> 00:25:33,993
Do you think you can be good?

308
00:25:34,893 --> 00:25:37,208
I don't wanna be here, mom.

309
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:38,268
Okay.

310
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:40,033
Okay. Well then let's go.

311
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,018
Let's just get in the car

312
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:46,688
and let's drive around
until we run out of gas

313
00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:49,118
and then we can find a nice overpass

314
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:51,138
that we can live under.

315
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:52,713
Would you like that Jackson?

316
00:25:55,653 --> 00:25:56,486
Huh?

317
00:25:57,467 --> 00:26:01,198
Or you could just stay here for three days

318
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,958
just until Friday.

319
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,723
Just until I can save up enough
that I can get us a place.

320
00:26:08,314 --> 00:26:10,031
You would just be the three of us,

321
00:26:10,073 --> 00:26:13,323
like it used to be, no Robbie.

322
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,723
The choice is yours.

323
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:25,718
Three days without algebra.

324
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,205
Who could turn that down?

325
00:26:27,247 --> 00:26:28,164
Oh, baby.

326
00:26:36,098 --> 00:26:37,459
Oh.

327
00:26:37,501 --> 00:26:38,618
I'll Call.

328
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:40,263
I promise I'll call.

329
00:26:41,424 --> 00:26:42,257
Okay.

330
00:26:44,472 --> 00:26:45,305
I'll call.

331
00:26:47,164 --> 00:26:49,914
[dramatic music]

332
00:27:19,899 --> 00:27:22,732
[car engine revs]

333
00:27:32,970 --> 00:27:36,108
We don't stand for any
profanity in this house.

334
00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:38,113
No taking the Lord's name in bay.

335
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:40,858
You only get three strikes,

336
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:43,188
three strikes and no more than that.

337
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:45,113
What happens after three strikes?

338
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:51,248
Hi, you must be Emma and Jackson.

339
00:27:51,290 --> 00:27:52,081
My name's Hank.

340
00:27:52,123 --> 00:27:53,358
It's very nice to meet you.

341
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,750
Wow, where have you been?

342
00:27:56,450 --> 00:27:59,411
Oh, Mason, the gardener.

343
00:27:59,453 --> 00:28:04,453
His, car broke down and
I had to jump in my off.

344
00:28:06,362 --> 00:28:09,408
Mm, Emma, why don't you come with me?

345
00:28:09,450 --> 00:28:11,150
I have your uniform down the hall.

346
00:28:12,255 --> 00:28:15,088
[prepares throat]

347
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:23,138
Breakfast is at 8:00 AM sharp, every day.

348
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:25,123
Come bring a gum shine and there's to be

349
00:28:25,165 --> 00:28:26,468
- Still more time.
- no more one person

350
00:28:26,510 --> 00:28:28,288
in the bathroom at any given time.

351
00:28:28,330 --> 00:28:30,480
I'm gonna get you
out of here. I promise.

352
00:28:32,730 --> 00:28:33,563
Rebecca.

353
00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:36,903
This is Emma.

354
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:39,998
She and her brother Jackson
have just joined us.

355
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:41,773
I trust you'll show her the ropes,

356
00:28:43,570 --> 00:28:47,163
but don't you have breakfast to make?

357
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:53,618
Been in the system since
she was three years old,

358
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:57,093
lost a kid, you know, bless her heart.

359
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,698
Yeah.

360
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:03,353
Let's get you into that uniform. [laughs]

361
00:29:04,513 --> 00:29:07,346
[dramatic music]

362
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:13,088
So you're telling me,

363
00:29:13,130 --> 00:29:15,338
I acted out on my homosexual urges

364
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:18,028
because I long for a
father figure in my life.

365
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:19,648

00:41:12,270 --> 00:41:14,638
I probably a dozen at least.

547
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:18,248
I mean, if not more, I know
the main ones in Florida.

548
00:41:18,290 --> 00:41:20,840
You ever notice all the
crazy happening in Florida?

549
00:41:23,210 --> 00:41:25,748
Do you think Mary Esther
is still downstairs?

550
00:41:25,790 --> 00:41:26,868
Why?

551
00:41:26,910 --> 00:41:29,188
I saw a phone in her room.

552
00:41:29,230 --> 00:41:30,913
I wanna go try to call my mom.

553
00:41:31,910 --> 00:41:33,088
Are you crazy?

554
00:41:33,130 --> 00:41:34,388
Why, if she catches you?

555
00:41:34,430 --> 00:41:36,458
So I'll get a strike.

556
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:38,218
I just have to know if my mom's okay.

557
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:40,170
No, Wait, are you...

558
00:41:42,564 --> 00:41:45,397
[dramatic music]

559
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:25,820
Oh, that line hasn't
worked for a while now.

560
00:42:26,790 --> 00:42:29,040
Keep meaning to fix it,
but there's no point.

561
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:35,388
I'm afraid, this is
your first strike Emma.

562
00:42:35,430 --> 00:42:36,221
No, I was just trying to...

563
00:42:36,263 --> 00:42:38,663
You were just snooping
where you shouldn't be.

564
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:52,688
Now, be the good girl I know you are

565
00:42:52,730 --> 00:42:54,268
and go to dinner.

566
00:42:54,310 --> 00:42:55,143
Trust me.

567
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:57,490
You don't want another strike.

568
00:43:19,344 --> 00:43:20,135
And that's when her dad walked in us.

569
00:43:20,177 --> 00:43:21,208
'Cause she wasn't supposed to come back

570
00:43:21,250 --> 00:43:22,041
until later that night.

571
00:43:22,083 --> 00:43:23,488
But then like, "Oh my God."

572
00:43:23,530 --> 00:43:25,108
And then of course they told my Grammy

573
00:43:25,150 --> 00:43:26,458
and she like freaked out.

574
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:29,458
So the second I get out of here,

575
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:30,638
I'm gonna go see her.

576
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:31,928
She lives in Seattle now,

577
00:43:31,970 --> 00:43:34,898
but it's kind of why I'm here
is cuz I got caught talking

578
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:36,648
to her online again. So...

579
00:43:36,690 --> 00:43:38,355
Are you even gonna try Kris?

580
00:43:38,397 --> 00:43:41,958
Why should I, when you try
hard enough for the both of us.

581
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,938
Jackson, don't listen to her.

582
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:45,468
This program works.

583
00:43:45,510 --> 00:43:47,838
I mean look at HanK and
Mary Esther as proof.

584
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:50,008
Yeah, that's a really
good selling point.

585
00:43:50,050 --> 00:43:52,198
I too hope one day to have a stick

586
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:54,998
as firmly implanted in my ass.

587
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:56,688
These are their chicken.

588
00:43:56,730 --> 00:43:58,723
Is what I hope we're having tonight.

589
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:01,918
Yeah.

590
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:02,853
Keep laughing.

591
00:44:03,927 --> 00:44:05,225
Not fall the way to hell.

592
00:44:05,267 --> 00:44:07,698
You know, Joel, when you
get over traumatic like that,

593
00:44:07,740 --> 00:44:10,083
your inner queen really shines through.

594
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:13,433
Where is Hank?

595
00:44:16,270 --> 00:44:18,783
Well, what a wonderful question.

596
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:20,788
Let me go find him.

597
00:44:20,830 --> 00:44:22,923
I'd hate for his food to get cold.

598
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:30,380
Don't eat before prayer.

599
00:44:31,761 --> 00:44:33,423
A few of us have learned
that the hard way.

600
00:44:35,210 --> 00:44:38,178
You know, Mattel would
be nice every now and then.

601
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:40,473
If my aunt saw the
charges, we'd be screwed.

602
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:43,853
[Mary] Hank, are you in there?

603
00:44:45,820 --> 00:44:46,698
I'll be on a second.

604
00:44:46,740 --> 00:44:49,459
I've I've got a stomach ache.

605
00:44:49,501 --> 00:44:51,133
[Mary] Don't take too long.

606
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:55,734
So I applied for another job last week.

607
00:44:55,776 --> 00:44:58,173
Well yeah, well maybe
you can get the hotel room.

608
00:44:59,060 --> 00:45:00,193
It's in Chicago.

609
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:03,733
Well.

610
00:45:05,870 --> 00:45:07,388
I mean, I just thought you should know

611
00:45:07,430 --> 00:45:09,590
in case I get it know and I probably won't

612
00:45:11,437 --> 00:45:12,270
but if I do,

613
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:15,330
I'd like you to come with me.

614
00:45:25,273 --> 00:45:28,190
[slow piano music]

615
00:45:29,710 --> 00:45:31,960
I think you should
leave out the back door.

616
00:45:32,860 --> 00:45:34,810
I don't want my aunt to get suspicious.

617
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:38,717
[slow piano music]

618
00:45:57,170 --> 00:45:59,693
I Was a drinker.

619
00:46:01,020 --> 00:46:02,478
I was on drugs and wandering through

620
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:03,993
the wilderness of sin.

621
00:46:04,850 --> 00:46:06,578
I was a gambler.

622
00:46:06,620 --> 00:46:08,193
I used to be homosexual.

623
00:46:10,211 --> 00:46:11,211
Not anymore.

624
00:46:12,646 --> 00:46:13,813
Not anymore.

625
00:46:14,648 --> 00:46:15,648
Not anymore.

626
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:19,113
Not anymore.

627
00:46:20,930 --> 00:46:22,668
These are the faces of people,

628
00:46:22,710 --> 00:46:26,388
just like you and me who
are once sinners and resists

629
00:46:26,430 --> 00:46:28,128
and have had their lives turned around

630
00:46:28,170 --> 00:46:29,322
by the guidance of Abraham house.

631
00:46:29,364 --> 00:46:31,328
- Let me see it. [laughs]
- Hello?

632
00:46:31,370 --> 00:46:34,598
I'm Andrew eight founder
of children of Abraham.

633
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:36,528
You know, most people don't know.

634
00:46:36,570 --> 00:46:39,668
All you have to do to be
one of God's chosen warriors

635
00:46:39,710 --> 00:46:41,678
is to ask him to save you

636
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:44,308
and then tell him that you
will save as many souls

637
00:46:44,350 --> 00:46:47,968
as you can from the shackles
of sin until you die.

638
00:46:48,010 --> 00:46:50,278
Because the more souls you save for Jesus,

639
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:51,868
the greater you'll be in his eyes.

640
00:46:51,910 --> 00:46:54,193
And the greater your
are in the Lord's eyes,

641
00:46:55,050 --> 00:46:56,968
the greater your reward is in heaven.

642
00:46:57,010 --> 00:46:58,024
I'm not gonna sugar coat it, folks,

643
00:46:58,066 --> 00:46:59,278
[laughs]

644
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:02,928
we have to be willing to
die for what we believe in.

645
00:47:02,970 --> 00:47:06,118
Our very livelihood and
our children's lives,

646
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:06,951
depend on it.

647
00:47:06,993 --> 00:47:09,120
I've said this before,
and I'll say it again.

648
00:47:10,060 --> 00:47:14,188
Do you think Jesus wants
a bunch of lady-boys,

649
00:47:14,230 --> 00:47:17,328
baby-killers and whores in his kingdom?

650
00:47:17,370 --> 00:47:18,498
Is being one of those

651
00:47:18,540 --> 00:47:22,298
worth losing out on an eternity with him.

652
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:26,163
If so, I hope you didn't pack
your winter coat with you,

653
00:47:26,205 --> 00:47:27,905
cuz you're going straight to hell.

654
00:47:30,816 --> 00:47:32,622
[zips]

655
00:47:32,664 --> 00:47:35,497
[dramatic music]

656

[zips]

657
00:48:14,824 --> 00:48:17,388
Where did you go this morning?

658
00:48:17,430 --> 00:48:18,858
I told you Mason, he...

659
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:22,498
How are we supposed to
save these children's souls?

660
00:48:22,540 --> 00:48:24,393
If one of us is still sinning,

661
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:28,200
Take out your sin stick and get it hard.

662
00:48:39,214 --> 00:48:41,748
- Your friend, she seems
- what?

663
00:48:41,790 --> 00:48:42,581
Nothing.

664
00:48:42,623 --> 00:48:44,708
I just thought we were
sitting here to get away

665
00:48:44,750 --> 00:48:45,858
from people like that.

666
00:48:45,900 --> 00:48:47,378
People like what?

667
00:48:47,420 --> 00:48:49,948
Come on Emma, she was
making fun of the videos.

668
00:48:49,990 --> 00:48:51,678
Did you see them?

669
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:52,511
I mean, come on.

670
00:48:52,553 --> 00:48:54,208
Those people are obviously brainwashed.

671
00:48:54,250 --> 00:48:55,833
Or are they just happy?

672
00:48:58,700 --> 00:48:59,533
Oh my God.

673
00:49:01,380 --> 00:49:03,583
You're falling for it, aren't you?

674
00:49:04,750 --> 00:49:06,568
It's just two more days.

675
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:08,048
It's not that long.

676
00:49:08,090 --> 00:49:10,408
Let's just hope that mom has a plan.

677
00:49:10,450 --> 00:49:12,678
Rebecca said her and
her sister have been here

678
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:14,133
almost a week.

679
00:49:15,100 --> 00:49:17,138
Maybe they need more help than we do.

680
00:49:17,180 --> 00:49:18,128
Try to get some sleep.

681
00:49:18,170 --> 00:49:22,683
She said they locked her
sister in a room for two days.

682
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:26,040
How is that supposed to help anyone.

683
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:30,028
Follow the rules and you
wanna have to find out.

684
00:49:30,070 --> 00:49:32,248
I was just trying to call mom.

685
00:49:32,290 --> 00:49:33,118
Why?

686
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:35,218
Because I'm afraid
that he's gonna hurt her.

687
00:49:35,260 --> 00:49:36,493
Why would he do that?

688
00:49:41,610 --> 00:49:42,443
You're right.

689
00:49:44,250 --> 00:49:45,750
We should just get some sleep.

690
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:49,948
Follow the rules.

691
00:49:49,990 --> 00:49:52,283
And we'll be fine for me,

692
00:49:54,850 --> 00:49:55,683
for mom.

693
00:49:57,380 --> 00:49:59,258
If she hasn't called by tomorrow,

694
00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:00,763
I'm getting out of here.

695
00:50:04,010 --> 00:50:05,390
One way or another.

696
00:50:08,297 --> 00:50:11,214
[slow piano music]

697
00:50:27,207 --> 00:50:32,124
Yeah, you won't be tempted
to use that thing for a while.

698
00:50:35,900 --> 00:50:39,278
Hank, we're doing the right thing.

699
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:41,768
The rewards in God's kingdom out number

700
00:50:41,810 --> 00:50:43,763
any patents of the flesh.

701
00:50:45,140 --> 00:50:47,323
Think how proud God will be of us.

702
00:50:48,870 --> 00:50:50,523
He came to me last night.

703
00:50:52,071 --> 00:50:55,223
Well the girl downstairs,
she didn't wanna be saved.

704
00:50:57,030 --> 00:50:59,148
What was I supposed to do?

705
00:50:59,190 --> 00:51:00,678
Let her corrupt the rest of us?

706
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:03,228
I'm not going to be responsible for that.

707
00:51:03,270 --> 00:51:04,103
I can't...

708
00:51:05,117 --> 00:51:06,558
Is only the ones who
don't wanna be saved.

709
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:08,018
No one's gonna to miss them.

710
00:51:08,060 --> 00:51:10,993
Not society, not their parents.

711
00:51:13,630 --> 00:51:15,763
It got a little messy.

712
00:51:17,950 --> 00:51:21,886
Try not to make too much
noise when you clean it up.

716
00:52:21,930 --> 00:52:23,130
Has my mom called yet?

717
00:52:24,120 --> 00:52:25,898
They day is still young,

718
00:52:25,940 --> 00:52:28,132
she might give us a ring later.

719
00:52:28,174 --> 00:52:29,388
[laughs]

720
00:52:29,430 --> 00:52:33,408
Lots of yummy vitamins for
you all, get you all strong.

721
00:52:33,450 --> 00:52:35,553
And I went ahead and laid out the bacon.

722
00:52:39,660 --> 00:52:42,568
Rebecca, please work on your gate.

723
00:52:42,610 --> 00:52:44,838
I could hear you clumping
all the way down the hall.

724
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:46,288
Like a truck driver.

725
00:52:46,330 --> 00:52:47,588
We can't have that.

726
00:52:47,630 --> 00:52:48,623
Not today.

727
00:52:49,610 --> 00:52:50,443
What's today?

728
00:52:52,070 --> 00:52:53,098
After breakfast,

729
00:52:53,140 --> 00:52:54,528
we're having a makeup tutorial

730
00:52:54,570 --> 00:52:59,393
and then we're having
a sort of Fashion show.

731
00:53:00,330 --> 00:53:02,393
Were you making a plate
for Megan this morning?

732
00:53:03,262 --> 00:53:04,212
I'll do it later.

733
00:53:10,620 --> 00:53:12,120
She should have called know.

734
00:53:13,220 --> 00:53:15,670
She's know he's done
something horrible to her.

735
00:53:17,390 --> 00:53:18,393
Hey you okay.

736
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:22,238
I just have to find a
way in there to see Megan.

737
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:24,368
I mean, just to know she's okay.

738
00:53:24,410 --> 00:53:26,933
I think I know where
Mary Esther keeps the keys.

739
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:32,040
And how are we gonna get those?

740
00:53:32,082 --> 00:53:32,873
I don't know.

741
00:53:32,915 --> 00:53:35,268
Wait until they fall asleep and sneak in.

742
00:53:35,310 --> 00:53:37,628
What if we get caught
and wind up where Megan is?

743
00:53:37,670 --> 00:53:39,573
This is your sixth day.

744
00:53:42,390 --> 00:53:43,940
Don't you wanna at least try.

745
00:53:45,150 --> 00:53:47,588
Hurry up girls.

746
00:53:47,630 --> 00:53:49,267
Keep the boys waiting off.

747
00:53:53,308 --> 00:53:54,141
There.

748
00:53:56,580 --> 00:53:58,068
Much better.

749
00:53:58,110 --> 00:53:59,683
You have five minutes.

750
00:54:06,995 --> 00:54:09,828
You really think this will work.

751
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:19,063
These are women.

752
00:54:20,220 --> 00:54:24,438
They will put on this earth
to please you to pleasure you

753
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:27,168
and to bear are and raise your children.

754
00:54:27,210 --> 00:54:28,453
Aren't they pretty?

755
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:34,093
Well girls.

756
00:54:35,090 --> 00:54:37,368
You're not doing very much
to entice these young men

757
00:54:37,410 --> 00:54:39,468
or you show a little skin.

758
00:54:39,510 --> 00:54:41,048
I don't feel comfortable...

759
00:54:41,090 --> 00:54:42,988
Emma, doing God's work
it's never comfortable.

760
00:54:43,030 --> 00:54:46,103
That were, there'd be more
true believers out there.

761
00:54:47,080 --> 00:54:48,518
Rebecca.

762
00:54:48,560 --> 00:54:50,113
Show her how it's done.

763
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:53,428
Look, you're used to taking
off your clothes for boys.

764
00:54:53,470 --> 00:54:54,303
Aren't you?

765
00:54:55,796 --> 00:54:58,573
And Hank, you choose
who's first up to bat.

766
00:55:06,030 --> 00:55:09,113
Jackson, why don't you come up here?

767
00:55:29,670 --> 00:55:30,603
Take it out.

768
00:55:32,470 --> 00:55:33,508
Wait.

769
00:55:33,550 --> 00:55:34,383
Huh?

770
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:36,650
Didn't you hear me?

771
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:40,091
Did you hear me?

772
00:55:40,133 --> 00:55:43,843
I said, take it Out.

773
00:55:44,750 --> 00:55:45,541
I can handle this.

774
00:55:45,583 --> 00:55:48,338
Oh, can you I'd like to see,

775
00:55:48,380 --> 00:55:51,280
try to save these souls when
you can't even save your own.

776
00:55:55,890 --> 00:55:57,563
Jackson, do what she tells you.

777
00:56:02,210 --> 00:56:03,708
I don't really think I...

778
00:56:03,750 --> 00:56:06,353
I'd hate to tell your
parents you gotta strike.

779
00:56:07,290 --> 00:56:09,648
Hey, Hey, you don't have, have to do this.

780
00:56:09,690 --> 00:56:11,238
No it's for his own good.

781
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:13,788
Get back where you were unless

782
00:56:13,830 --> 00:56:15,823
you're going for your second strike.

783
00:56:19,940 --> 00:56:20,773
It's fine.

784
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:23,777
I want to get better.

785
00:56:30,723 --> 00:56:34,163
Now, Jackson, look at Rebecca.

786
00:56:37,580 --> 00:56:39,128
I want you to look at her.

787
00:56:39,170 --> 00:56:42,263
Look at her and get it hard.

788
00:56:45,399 --> 00:56:46,228
Oh, it shouldn't be too difficult

789
00:56:46,270 --> 00:56:47,553
if you're a real man.

790
00:56:49,140 --> 00:56:50,368
Hank.

791
00:56:50,410 --> 00:56:51,568
You should be watching this.

792
00:56:51,610 --> 00:56:53,978
You could learn a thing or two.

793
00:56:54,020 --> 00:56:57,947
No, don't look at him look at her.

794
00:57:05,970 --> 00:57:10,648
Oh, I thought you enjoyed
showing off your body.

795
00:57:10,690 --> 00:57:13,408
That's what got you into this
situation in the first place.

796
00:57:13,450 --> 00:57:14,241
Isn't it.

797
00:57:14,283 --> 00:57:16,063
But don't be shy now.

798
00:57:17,882 --> 00:57:20,313
Oh, What's wrong.

799
00:57:21,770 --> 00:57:24,483
Can only get excited if the
whole tennis team watches.

800
00:57:26,970 --> 00:57:31,453
Christina, why don't you
step up to the plate.

801
00:57:41,793 --> 00:57:43,626
Now, entice Jackson.

802
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:46,753
Stop.

803
00:57:47,810 --> 00:57:49,213
Do you wanna stop Jackson?

804
00:57:52,982 --> 00:57:54,093
Will a real man stop.

805
00:57:57,626 --> 00:57:59,648
You think your stepfather would stop.

806
00:57:59,690 --> 00:58:01,438
Please, stop.

807
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:06,480
Oh, Maybe you need a
little more of this wage?

808
00:58:06,817 --> 00:58:08,023
I said stop it.

809
00:58:11,530 --> 00:58:13,058
Joel.

810
00:58:13,100 --> 00:58:14,648
Why don't you come up here?

811
00:58:14,690 --> 00:58:17,953
No, this class is dismissed.

812
00:58:20,140 --> 00:58:21,983
Go to your rooms for Bible study.

813
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:26,958
Jackson will resume this tomorrow.

814
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,350
I hope for your sake,
you come better prepared.

815
00:58:30,560 --> 00:58:32,360
Hate to think I was wrong about you.

816
00:58:38,810 --> 00:58:42,003
Why don't you want me
saving these children?

817
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:45,370
Did it really save you?

818
00:58:49,090 --> 00:58:50,103
Did it save me?

819
00:58:54,150 --> 00:58:54,983
Not knock.

820
00:58:56,080 --> 00:58:59,464
I hope I'm not interrupting
anything, but hey day?

821
00:58:59,506 --> 00:59:00,563
Of Course.

822
00:59:01,560 --> 00:59:03,008
But you won't have to
worry about it next month.

823
00:59:03,050 --> 00:59:06,663
I just got a new job In Chicago.

824
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:09,890
I'll be leaving in a couple days.

825
00:59:11,557 --> 00:59:13,928
[laughs] Well, I would say,

826
00:59:13,970 --> 00:59:16,408
what will we do without
your work in the garden?

827
00:59:16,450 --> 00:59:19,423
But the good Lord tells me we'll manage.

828
00:59:24,180 --> 00:59:25,688
How are we gonna get
back to civilization

829
00:59:25,730 --> 00:59:27,118
after we sneak out?

830
00:59:27,160 --> 00:59:29,598
Hitchhike, swim, okay?

831
00:59:29,640 --> 00:59:32,238
Their car keys have got
to be on that set of keys.

832
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:33,788
Oh great, stay in the car.

833
00:59:33,830 --> 00:59:34,968
That'll look great on my record.

834
00:59:35,010 --> 00:59:36,368
What other choice do we have?

835
00:59:36,410 --> 00:59:38,783
We have got to get out
if you're and go home.

836
00:59:40,900 --> 00:59:42,138
Must be nice.

837
00:59:42,180 --> 00:59:43,013
What?

838
00:59:44,010 --> 00:59:45,510
Having a home to go back to.

839
00:59:48,100 --> 00:59:50,378
Even if I get out of here,

840
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:53,068
they're still gonna
send me somewhere else.

841
00:59:53,110 --> 00:59:55,058
Somewhere where they're just
taking me in for the extra

842
00:59:55,100 --> 00:59:56,300
check money every month.

843
00:59:57,470 --> 00:59:58,763
Somewhere without Meghan.

844
01:00:00,560 --> 01:00:02,660
You really love Meghan a lot, don't you?

845
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:06,108
I mean, even though
we don't share blood,

846
01:00:06,150 --> 01:00:07,605
she's always been there for me.

847
01:00:07,647 --> 01:00:10,198
And I like to think I've
always been there for her too.

848
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:13,643
Then be there for her now
and get her out of there.

849
01:00:15,460 --> 01:00:18,023
And Jackson, is he coming with us?

850
01:00:18,931 --> 01:00:19,722
I don't know.

851
01:00:19,764 --> 01:00:20,555
You can't just leave him here.

852
01:00:20,597 --> 01:00:21,430
I know.

853
01:00:22,390 --> 01:00:26,123
Now, have to persuade him somehow.

854
01:00:28,620 --> 01:00:29,718
Hey, what is that stuff

855
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:31,960
St. Mary Esther always
puts in the Kool-Aid.

856
01:00:33,190 --> 01:00:34,488
Vitamins and...

857
01:00:34,530 --> 01:00:36,018
I guess. I don't know.

858
01:00:36,060 --> 01:00:38,308
That's what I thought too, but...

859
01:00:38,350 --> 01:00:39,888
But what.

860
01:00:39,930 --> 01:00:41,538
Something about the way she reacted

861
01:00:41,580 --> 01:00:44,068
and I caught her mixing
it in this morning.

862
01:00:44,110 --> 01:00:47,158
What do you think it
is, poison or something?

863
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:48,063
I don't know.

864
01:00:49,340 --> 01:00:52,661
Although it is kind of weird
ever since we got here,

865
01:00:52,703 --> 01:00:54,958
I've had an easier time sleeping.

866
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:56,258
I mean, Jackson practically had

867
01:00:56,300 --> 01:00:58,288
to shake me awake this morning.

868
01:00:58,330 --> 01:00:59,218
You know, come to think of it.

869
01:00:59,260 --> 01:01:01,618
I have been sleeping
better since I got here.

870
01:01:01,660 --> 01:01:03,760
And you think it'd be the opposite, right?

871
01:01:05,620 --> 01:01:06,818
I guess there's only a way to find out

872
01:01:06,860 --> 01:01:08,210
if there's something in it.

873
01:01:16,014 --> 01:01:19,051
Should we start without him?

874
01:01:19,093 --> 01:01:21,428
Huh, that would be rude.

875
01:01:21,470 --> 01:01:22,303
Wouldn't it?

876
01:01:29,250 --> 01:01:30,293
What are you doing?

877
01:01:30,335 --> 01:01:32,120
We saw Mary Esther put
something in it this morning.

878
01:01:32,162 --> 01:01:32,953
We?

879
01:01:32,995 --> 01:01:34,328
Emma saw put something in it.

880
01:01:34,370 --> 01:01:36,137
It's probably just vitamins.

881
01:01:36,179 --> 01:01:38,048
What if it's poisoning or something?

882
01:01:38,090 --> 01:01:38,998
Why do you always assume the worst?

883
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:39,898
First it was Robbie,

884
01:01:39,940 --> 01:01:41,988
mow it's Hank and Mary Esther.

885
01:01:42,030 --> 01:01:44,368
Did you ever think they
might wanna help us?

886
01:01:44,410 --> 01:01:46,318
What they did this afternoon?

887
01:01:46,360 --> 01:01:47,972
What you call that help?

888
01:01:48,014 --> 01:01:50,847
[dramatic music]

889
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:04,003
Are you eating?

890
01:02:06,220 --> 01:02:07,070
I'm not hungry.

891
01:02:09,340 --> 01:02:12,709
Well, a fast for Peanuts.

892
01:02:12,751 --> 01:02:14,158
[laughs]

893
01:02:14,200 --> 01:02:15,750
Maybe there's hope for you yet.

894
01:02:19,376 --> 01:02:22,209
[dramatic music]

895
01:02:50,470 --> 01:02:51,788
Mom has a plan.

896
01:02:51,830 --> 01:02:53,248
Why do you wanna jeopardize that?

897
01:02:53,290 --> 01:02:55,338
Because, I'm afraid if
like he's going to do to her.

898
01:02:55,380 --> 01:02:58,758
What's he gonna do to
her Emma provide for her.

899
01:02:58,800 --> 01:03:00,578
Why would he do that?

900
01:03:00,620 --> 01:03:02,188
He must have an ulterior motive.

901
01:03:02,230 --> 01:03:04,588
Just like her last boyfriend
and the one before that

902
01:03:04,630 --> 01:03:06,318
and all the other ones you've driven off.

903
01:03:06,360 --> 01:03:07,908
Because he told me he'd kill her,

904
01:03:07,950 --> 01:03:09,808

01:22:42,810 --> 01:22:45,227
[slow music]

1089
01:23:32,636 --> 01:23:34,959
[screaming]

1090
01:23:35,001 --> 01:23:40,001
Jesus is coming from me. [laughs]

1091
01:23:45,268 --> 01:23:48,018
[dramatic music]

1092
01:25:48,927 --> 01:25:51,010
[knocks]

1093
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:12,253
Oh my babies.

1094
01:26:13,400 --> 01:26:14,308
What happens?

1095
01:26:14,350 --> 01:26:17,098
We thought he'd done
something horrible to you.

1096
01:26:17,140 --> 01:26:18,238
No baby.

1097
01:26:18,280 --> 01:26:20,502
Why would you think that?

1098
01:26:20,544 --> 01:26:22,698
Oh God. Oh my God.

1099
01:26:22,740 --> 01:26:24,283
Okay, let's get you inside.

1100
01:26:32,214 --> 01:26:34,208
I was gonna call tonight.

1101
01:26:34,250 --> 01:26:36,243
What happened to the two of you?

1102
01:26:38,200 --> 01:26:39,773
They tried to kill us, mom.

1103
01:26:42,410 --> 01:26:43,703
You must be hungry.

1104
01:26:44,610 --> 01:26:46,210
Let me fix you something to eat.

1105
01:27:19,370 --> 01:27:22,523
Did you know what kind
of a place that was?

1106
01:27:26,710 --> 01:27:30,433
Please tell me, you didn't know.

1107
01:27:33,990 --> 01:27:38,758
Maybe I could call Abraham
house and see if they're-

1108
01:27:38,800 --> 01:27:39,750
- They're all dead.

1109
01:27:41,800 --> 01:27:42,803
Everyone.

1110
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:50,005
You said you were gonna
call, you never called.

1111
01:27:50,047 --> 01:27:51,538
You said you'd call.

1112
01:27:51,580 --> 01:27:55,208
You said that you would come back for us.

1113
01:27:55,250 --> 01:27:56,698
I was gonna call you.

1114
01:27:56,740 --> 01:27:58,208
I was gonna call you tonight.

1115
01:27:58,250 --> 01:27:59,138
[Emma] Bull shit.

1116
01:27:59,180 --> 01:28:02,633
Okay, Jackson, can you
please calm your sister down?

1117
01:28:05,020 --> 01:28:07,520
We were never supposed
to get out of that place,

1118
01:28:09,110 --> 01:28:09,943
Were we?

1119
01:28:11,120 --> 01:28:13,838
All you had to do was
just follow the rules, Emma.

1120
01:28:13,880 --> 01:28:16,783
I mean, why didn't you
just follow the rules.

1121
01:28:18,690 --> 01:28:19,523
Emma.

1122
01:28:25,030 --> 01:28:25,821
You don't hate me.

1123
01:28:25,863 --> 01:28:26,696
Do you Jackson?

1124
01:28:40,010 --> 01:28:42,628
I was thinking that we could leave tonight

1125
01:28:42,670 --> 01:28:44,888
and we could go somewhere special.

1126
01:28:44,930 --> 01:28:46,283
Just the three of us.

1127
01:28:47,617 --> 01:28:49,284
Would you like that?

1128
01:28:51,416 --> 01:28:53,749
It wasn't about saving us.

1129
01:28:54,730 --> 01:28:56,253
It was about saving you.

1130
01:28:58,240 --> 01:28:59,313
Jackson.

1131
01:29:01,500 --> 01:29:03,813
You don't want your mom
to go to hell, do you.

1132
01:29:07,105 --> 01:29:09,605
Honey, you wouldn't want that.

1133
01:29:11,271 --> 01:29:12,104
Would you?

1134
01:29:27,767 --> 01:29:30,350
[door squeaks]

1135
01:29:37,950 --> 01:29:39,625

1136
01:29:39,667 --> 01:29:40,500
Help!

1137
01:29:43,428 --> 01:29:45,595
[screams]

1138
01:29:51,102 --> 01:29:51,935
Help!

1139
01:29:54,541 --> 01:29:55,374
Help!

1140
01:29:57,130 --> 01:29:59,297
[mumbles]

1141
01:30:02,236 --> 01:30:04,819

1142
01:30:06,076 --> 01:30:08,076

[dramatic music]

1148
01:30:44,824 --> 01:30:45,657
Mum?

1149
01:30:54,718 --> 01:30:57,369
[shouts]

1150
01:30:57,411 --> 01:30:58,244
Stop!

1151
01:31:03,057 --> 01:31:05,057
[cries]

1152
01:31:13,159 --> 01:31:13,950
[thud]

1153
01:31:13,992 --> 01:31:15,992

[car ignites]

1159
01:33:20,231 --> 01:33:21,728
So where are we going now?

1160
01:33:21,770 --> 01:33:23,370
[Emma] I was thinking Florida.

1161
01:33:24,310 --> 01:33:27,519
You forgot guys, all the
weird shit happens in Florida.

1162
01:33:27,561 --> 01:33:30,311
[dramatic music]

1163
01:33:36,372 --> 01:33:38,955
