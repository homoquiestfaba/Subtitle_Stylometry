23
00:01:51,579 --> 00:01:55,647

<i> Well, it's Texas.</i>

<i> That's Riley. Riley's</i>

<i>But she's like a sister to me.</i>

-Oh Jessi, you're not
recording us, are you?
-You guys are cute, look, look.

42
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:07,452
-Oh, shaking it, yeah.
-How about that?

43
00:03:08,255 --> 00:03:10,589
Music's so loud it's going
to burst my ear drums.

Do you always have
to ruin everything?

Hey, how about sharing?

46
00:03:14,929 --> 00:03:17,229
No, don't give her any,
she's crazy when she drinks.

47
00:03:17,231 --> 00:03:20,666
-This is true.
-Oh whatever, a little wine
won't hurt, we're on vacation.

-[Riley] No, you're too young.
-No, I'm not.

Oh, you are.

54
00:03:32,746 --> 00:03:33,779
Just a sip.

55
00:03:33,781 --> 00:03:36,315
-She got a glass.
-[mom] She's older than you.

56

[Aylin] Hi.

Thank you.

It's nice to meet you, Aylin.

87
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:11,076
That ugly guy that went off
running with your friend,

88
00:05:11,078 --> 00:05:13,779
that's my buddy from college,
his name's Jarrod.

89
00:05:13,781 --> 00:05:16,549
Cool.

90
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:19,318
-Where you from?
-Oklahoma, but we have
a beach house down here.

91
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:22,054
Nice. I was born
and raised here.

92
00:05:22,056 --> 00:05:24,489
I never got to go anywhere
'til I went to college.

-Sittin' all by yourself?
-Thanks, that's real nice.

98
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:36,868
What are you into?

99
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:43,709
When I'm home I just
hang out with friends, play
football, work out. I'm boring.

100
00:05:43,711 --> 00:05:47,746
-What do you like to do?
-Well, when I'm back
home, I usually just

101
00:05:48,449 --> 00:05:52,351
hang out with friends, play
football, work out. I'm boring.

102
00:05:52,353 --> 00:05:54,419
-Okay.
-I do boring things.

103
00:05:54,421 --> 00:05:58,090
Mhmm. They say
great minds think alike.

104
00:05:58,092 --> 00:06:00,792
-Is that what they say?
-That is what they say.

105
00:06:00,794 --> 00:06:01,893
We should hang out.

106
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:04,463
Maybe.

107
00:06:04,465 --> 00:06:10,369
You know something?
You have got the most
beautiful eyes I have ever seen.

108
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:14,706
How do you, or is
there like eye modeling?

109
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:18,110
-You ever think about modeling?
-I'm going to be an actress.

110
00:06:18,112 --> 00:06:20,545
An actress, huh? That's cool.

111
00:06:21,115 --> 00:06:22,981
-How old are you?
-[Aylin's inner voice]
<i> Tell him the truth.</i>

112
00:06:23,684 --> 00:06:24,616
Eighteen.

-[Aylin's inner voice]<i> Oops.</i>
-Oh.

114
00:06:27,454 --> 00:06:29,788
You look older,
but in a good way.

115
00:06:31,592 --> 00:06:36,695
I'm 22, it's a great song,
do you want to dance? Do
you want to dance with me?

116
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:38,663
Sure.

117
00:06:38,665 --> 00:06:39,798
Watch your head.

118
00:06:42,403 --> 00:06:44,903
-You just got to follow
my lead, all right?
-Okay, okay.

119
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:47,189
You're gonna under.

<i> Ugh, he dances like</i>
<i> a pigeon with one leg.</i>

121
00:06:49,476 --> 00:06:50,942
You spin, you spin again.

<i> Is that an old girlfriend</i>
<i> giving you the evil eye?</i>

123
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:59,151
Oh, you know how to two step,
thought you were from Oklahoma?

124
00:06:59,153 --> 00:07:00,652
I guess it's all natural.

125
00:07:00,654 --> 00:07:01,953
I'm not gonna argue with that.

126
00:07:01,955 --> 00:07:08,160
-So, Jake, who's your friend?
-This is Aylin, Aylin, this
is my little sister, Natalie.

127
00:07:08,162 --> 00:07:09,861
You can call me Nat.

128
00:07:09,863 --> 00:07:11,496
Hi, nice to meet you, Nat.

129
00:07:11,498 --> 00:07:13,765
-You go to school around here?
-No, actually I'm--

130
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:14,933
-We're missing a good song.
-Oh.

131
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:15,934
Let's go.

132
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:19,971
[Aylin's inner voice]
<i> No worries. False alarm,</i>
<i> it's just his sister.</i>

133
00:07:20,507 --> 00:07:21,807
[Aylin laughing]
You're kind of good at this.

134

135
00:07:28,682 --> 00:07:29,948
[Aylin]<i> Here come</i>
<i> Jessi and Jarrod.</i>

136
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:33,618
<i> There's no way they were</i>
<i> dancing that whole time.</i>

137
00:07:34,188 --> 00:07:36,488
<i>I know Jessi better than that.</i>

138
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:37,923
[Jake] I'm pretty sure this
place is made of palm trees.

139
00:07:38,525 --> 00:07:40,459
Yeah, you remember
exactly where we were?

140
00:07:40,461 --> 00:07:43,562
I do, it was your mom's
house, that's why.

141
00:07:43,564 --> 00:07:44,930
-No.
-It's a really easy
place to remember.

142
00:07:44,932 --> 00:07:46,565
Don't talk about my mom, Jake.

143
00:07:48,602 --> 00:07:50,936
-[Jessi] What the hell?
-Okay, that was creepy.

144
00:07:50,938 --> 00:07:53,505
[Jessi] Yeah, well,
<i> c'est la vie.</i>

145
00:07:53,907 --> 00:07:55,674
How's it going out there?

146
00:07:55,676 --> 00:07:58,543
Honestly, pretty great.

147
00:07:58,545 --> 00:08:00,545
-Really?
-Yeah.

148
00:08:00,547 --> 00:08:03,014
This boy just drives me crazy.

149
00:08:03,016 --> 00:08:06,518
I don't know, there's something
different about him.

150
00:08:06,954 --> 00:08:09,988
I think I might
kind of like him.

151
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:13,023
You think you might kind
of like-- are you actually
hearing yourself, girl?

152
00:08:13,026 --> 00:08:15,494
-I mean-
- I know.

153
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:17,963
-you've met him a couple hours
ago and you think he's your
one true love or something?

154
00:08:17,965 --> 00:08:19,865
I know, I'm ridiculous.

155
00:08:19,867 --> 00:08:22,701
-Come on.
-I know, I know,
this is just vacation.

156
00:08:22,703 --> 00:08:24,636
I'm just gonna have fun.

157
00:08:24,637 --> 00:08:26,570
And be careful, you don't
know everything about him.

158
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:28,773
He doesn't know
everything about me.

159
00:08:28,775 --> 00:08:30,942
[Aylin's inner voice]<i> Like the</i>

-What?
-Your lips.

00:08:42,823 --> 00:08:45,290
-What about my lips?
-They're a new color.

166
00:08:45,292 --> 00:08:47,526
Yeah, well your sister liked it.

167
00:08:47,528 --> 00:08:49,628
Really, hmm.

168
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:52,797
What's wrong with my face?
What didn't she tell me.

169
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:54,733
Nothing, you look great.

170
00:08:54,968 --> 00:08:58,970
-Doesn't she look
great, Jarrod?
-Mhmm, yeah.

171
00:08:58,972 --> 00:09:01,606
-Yeah.
-You look great, you can trust
him, he got all A's in school.

172
00:09:01,608 --> 00:09:04,009
-Well, there was a B, but--
-Okay, I'm going
to the bathroom.

173
00:09:04,011 --> 00:09:05,710
-That's a good idea.
-Okay.

174
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:09,881
[Aylin's inner voice]<i> Okay,</i>
<i> putting eyeliner on my lips,</i>

175
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:12,617
<i> definitely not my</i>
<i> smoothest move,</i>

176
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:17,556
<i> but the tiki torches, the</i>
<i> boy sitting across from me?</i>

177
00:09:18,292 --> 00:09:19,691
<i> It's not Hawaii,</i>

178
00:09:20,661 --> 00:09:22,661
<i> but I'll take it.</i>

179
00:09:22,663 --> 00:09:25,830
I think the lovely lady
deserves a flower, don't you?

180
00:09:33,874 --> 00:09:36,491
There you go.

181
00:09:36,492 --> 00:09:39,109
Well, thank you, but I'm more
of a sunflower kind of girl.

182
00:09:40,614 --> 00:09:41,846
I'll remember that.

183
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:44,649
-Will you?
-Yeah.

184
00:09:44,651 --> 00:09:47,953
-What about five or
ten years from now?
-Yeah.

185
00:09:49,356 --> 00:09:51,823
Especially on such
a pretty girl like you.

186
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:59,731
[Aylin's inner voice]
<i> Giddy-up, I think I found</i>
<i> myself a cowboy.</i>

187
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:06,771
<i> ¶ The summer days</i>
<i> When you walked in ¶</i>

188
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:13,745
<i> ¶ I knew then that this</i>
<i> Would never end ¶</i>

189
00:10:14,681 --> 00:10:20,218
<i> ¶ I felt the heat</i>
<i> Beneath my skin ¶</i>

190
00:10:22,823 --> 00:10:27,192
<i> ¶ I could feel the whole world</i>
<i> Start to spin ¶</i>

191
00:10:29,763 --> 00:10:32,731
<i>¶ After all the years gone by ¶</i>

192
00:10:32,733 --> 00:10:36,735
<i> ¶ I think about</i>
<i> The tears I cried ¶</i>

193
00:10:36,737 --> 00:10:41,039
<i> ¶ Couldn't seem to get you</i>
<i> Off my mind ¶</i>

194
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:46,411
<i> ¶ Of all the places</i>
<i> I have gone ¶</i>

195
00:10:46,413 --> 00:10:50,015
<i> ¶ I've never felt</i>
<i> Like I belonged ¶</i>

196
00:10:50,017 --> 00:10:55,186
<i> ¶ Always seem to swim</i>
<i> Against the tide</i> ¶

197
00:10:56,123 --> 00:10:59,724
<i> ¶ Every time my life</i>
<i> Seems to fall apart ¶</i>

198
00:10:59,726 --> 00:11:02,994
<i> ¶ You were like a lifeline</i>
<i> Around the heart ¶</i>

199
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:08,900
<i>¶ In my dreams, in my dreams ¶</i>

200
00:11:09,903 --> 00:11:13,405
<i> ¶ You were like a drug</i>
<i> That I couldn't quit ¶</i>

201
00:11:13,407 --> 00:11:16,741
<i> ¶ I can feel your blood</i>

202
00:11:16,743 --> 00:11:19,728

203
00:11:19,729 --> 00:11:22,714
[Aylin's inner voice]
<i> Looks like this might</i>
<i> be the best summer ever.</i>

204
00:11:28,221 --> 00:11:29,821
You know, I had a
good time tonight.

205
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,856
You think I could see you again?

206
00:11:33,727 --> 00:11:36,961
You know I bet you
guys could come over.

207
00:11:37,931 --> 00:11:39,764
I don't think my
mom would mind.

208
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:41,833
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

209
00:11:42,936 --> 00:11:43,935
Hey, Jarrod.

210
00:11:43,937 --> 00:11:45,437
-Yeah?
-We're going to Aylin's.

211
00:11:45,439 --> 00:11:46,304
You got it.

212
00:11:46,773 --> 00:11:48,840
Done.

213
00:11:48,841 --> 00:11:50,908
Hey, everybody, pictures.
Come on, come on!

214
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:54,446
[Aylin's inner voice]<i> I wish</i>
<i> mom would quit taking those</i>
<i> pictures for her scrapbook.</i>

215
00:11:54,448 --> 00:11:56,081
<i> So embarrassing.</i>

216
00:11:57,751 --> 00:11:59,718
[Natalie] Can I please
go with you guys?

217
00:12:00,454 --> 00:12:02,821
Sorry, Nat, there's
only two kayaks.

218
00:12:02,823 --> 00:12:03,922
Will you take me later, then?

219
00:12:03,924 --> 00:12:05,724
Just hang out
with Jessi and Riley.

220
00:12:05,726 --> 00:12:07,125
Jessi told me to eff off.

221
00:12:07,127 --> 00:12:11,062
I'll be back soon,
I promise. Just have fun.

222
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:12,097
[Jessi] Get over here.

223
00:12:12,099 --> 00:12:13,732
Hey, hurry back then.

224
00:12:13,734 --> 00:12:17,001
-[Jessi] Hey, remember
that one time?
-[Jake] Will be back soon.

225
00:12:17,003 --> 00:12:19,537
-where one of our friends--
-Ready?

226
00:12:19,538 --> 00:12:22,072
-put something on her lips
that wasn't lipstick?
-[Aylin] Bye, you guys.

227
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:24,776
[Jessi] Remember that
one time? [chuckles]

228
00:12:28,749 --> 00:12:30,148
[Riley] Aylin!

229
00:12:31,184 --> 00:12:35,787
-[Riley] Stop!
-[Jessi] Hey! Get out.

230
00:12:35,789 --> 00:12:37,211
Get over here.

231
00:12:37,212 --> 00:12:38,634
[Jarrod] You gotta come back.

232
00:12:38,635 --> 00:12:40,057
[Jessi] Where did you
find him? He's so stupid.

233
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:41,526
[Riley] Disgusting.

234
00:12:41,527 --> 00:12:42,993
[Jessi] Although, I'm
glad we met you guys.

235
00:12:42,996 --> 00:12:46,231
We needed some testosterone,
right? Do you lift?

236
00:12:46,233 --> 00:12:47,999
[Jarrod] He might do
anything other than lift.

237
00:12:48,001 --> 00:12:49,534
They don't wake your neighbors.

238
00:12:49,536 --> 00:12:52,871
They won't, there's no one
here for them to wake.

239
00:12:52,873 --> 00:12:56,274
All of the snow birds
who live around me fly
north for the summer.

240
00:12:56,276 --> 00:13:00,078
[sighs] You know,
I've never been back
here, it's kind of hidden.

241
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,346
Well, surprise.

242
00:13:02,883 --> 00:13:04,783
Surprised about a
lot of things tonight.

243
00:13:08,188 --> 00:13:11,556
You know my parents bought this
place so they could go sailing.

244
00:13:11,558 --> 00:13:12,991
You have a sailboat?

245
00:13:12,993 --> 00:13:17,328
No, well we used to,
but my mom had to sell it.

246
00:13:17,998 --> 00:13:19,831
Reminded her of Dad.

247
00:13:22,269 --> 00:13:23,234
Did he leave?

248
00:13:24,905 --> 00:13:26,905
No, he killed himself.

249
00:13:29,576 --> 00:13:32,076
He had PTSD and uh...

250
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,379
I'm sorry.

251
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:39,818
It was last Thanksgiving.

252
00:13:42,289 --> 00:13:46,057
So, as you can expect,
the holidays aren't
really my favorite thing.

253
00:13:48,061 --> 00:13:49,561
I know what you mean.

254
00:13:49,563 --> 00:13:50,361
You do?

255
00:13:51,264 --> 00:13:52,263
Yeah.

256
00:13:56,036 --> 00:13:58,336
My brother passed
away when I was 16.

257
00:13:58,338 --> 00:14:00,839
Oh, Jake, I'm so sorry.

258
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:02,340
It's all right.

259
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:04,909
He was in a car accident

260
00:14:04,911 --> 00:14:12,283
and they had to take him to
the nearest city 'cause there
was no qualified surgeon here.

261
00:14:12,285 --> 00:14:14,886
By the time he got
there, it was too late.

262
00:14:15,989 --> 00:14:17,055
He was gone.

263
00:14:21,595 --> 00:14:24,028
Known what I was gonna
be since that day though.

264
00:14:24,598 --> 00:14:25,864
And what's that?

265
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,432
A doctor.

266
00:14:28,969 --> 00:14:31,135
You'd make a
pretty great doctor.

267
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:35,006
Yeah, you'd make a
pretty good superstar.

268
00:14:35,008 --> 00:14:36,975
Oh god, no I wouldn't.

269
00:14:36,977 --> 00:14:38,476
We'd be a power couple though.

270
00:14:39,179 --> 00:14:40,345
-Really?
-Yeah.

271
00:14:40,347 --> 00:14:43,147
I don't think superstars
go for doctors.

272
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:46,384
Well, there's a first
time for everything, so.

273
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,220
I think you might be right.

274
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,392
Wanna head back?

275
00:14:56,029 --> 00:14:58,062
Yeah, let's go.

276
00:14:59,132 --> 00:15:01,032
[calm music]

277
00:15:12,012 --> 00:15:13,278
[splash]

278
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:24,989
[splash]

279
00:15:34,034 --> 00:15:35,166
Wow.

280
00:15:36,202 --> 00:15:37,535
-What?
-You a mermaid?

281
00:15:38,405 --> 00:15:40,471
Maybe. How'd you guess?

282
00:15:43,143 --> 00:15:48,212
Dunno, this might have
something to do with it.
I don't know what it is.

283
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:51,482
Don't you know
what mermaids eat?

284
00:15:52,085 --> 00:15:55,386
-Tons of fish?
-No, men.

285
00:15:56,423 --> 00:15:57,956
You know what
their favorite are?

286
00:15:59,192 --> 00:16:00,325
Young men,

287
00:16:02,228 --> 00:16:06,431
poor helpless sailors,
or just maybe

288
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:13,104
college students returning
for home during the summer.

289
00:16:16,209 --> 00:16:17,976
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

290
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:21,412
.You know what it sounds like?
-What?

291
00:16:21,414 --> 00:16:25,049
I shouldn't get too close.

292
00:16:25,051 --> 00:16:27,986
-Ah, ah, ah!
Break it up, you two.
-[clears his throat]

293
00:16:27,988 --> 00:16:30,188
-Jake, time to go.
-Yes, ma'am.

294
00:16:30,523 --> 00:16:33,191
All right, Jake, let's go.

295
00:16:33,193 --> 00:16:34,192
All right.

296
00:16:34,194 --> 00:16:35,159
Come on.

297
00:16:35,729 --> 00:16:37,295
Just give me a sec.

298
00:16:37,297 --> 00:16:38,496
All right, I'll see
you tomorrow.

299
00:16:41,067 --> 00:16:42,400
[Jarrod] Nat's got shotgun.

300
00:16:48,074 --> 00:16:49,140
[sighs]

301
00:16:50,143 --> 00:16:52,410
[Aylin]<i> I really like this guy.</i>

302
00:16:56,349 --> 00:16:58,349
[mom] Aylin, you know
how much I love you.

303
00:16:58,351 --> 00:16:59,417
[Aylin] Yeah, of course.

304
00:16:59,419 --> 00:17:02,220
Well, it's about you and Jake.

305
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:05,623
Now, I think he's a
fine young man, but

306
00:17:07,794 --> 00:17:14,565
I worry about certain
things, temptations. What-

307
00:17:14,567 --> 00:17:20,371
What I'm trying to say
is I'm worried about
you two having sex.

308
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:22,340
Mom, we wouldn't do
that, we're not stupid.

309
00:17:22,342 --> 00:17:26,077
Well, maybe not
but I, I still worry.

310
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:27,578
Aylin, you're so young.

311
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:29,380
Yeah, but it's not
even like that.

312
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:32,550
We hold hands
and kiss, I swear.

313
00:17:35,488 --> 00:17:37,405
I believe you, but

314
00:17:37,406 --> 00:17:39,323
whoa when I see you
two look at each other,
I can't help but think that

315
00:17:40,126 --> 00:17:42,093
I, well-

316
00:17:42,095 --> 00:17:44,095
Well, you know me
better than that, Mom.

317
00:17:45,231 --> 00:17:46,397
I was young, too.

318
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:48,332
I know.

319
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:50,068
So, listen to me.

320
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:51,269
I don't think I want to.

321
00:17:51,271 --> 00:17:53,438
Well, too bad, you
don't have a choice.

322
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:58,476
It's been a very hard year
with your dad's death and all.

323
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:03,848
And I'd hate a wedge to come
between us because of a boy.

324
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:05,349
That would never happen, Mom.

325
00:18:05,351 --> 00:18:08,453
Yes, Aylin, it
could, I've seen it.

326
00:18:08,455 --> 00:18:12,490
-When?
-Well, it happened to
me, a long time ago.

327
00:18:12,492 --> 00:18:17,628
A boy came between me and
my parents and it wrecked
our whole lives for a long time.

328
00:18:18,231 --> 00:18:21,099
-You never told me that.
-Well, no need to.

329
00:18:21,434 --> 00:18:25,570
I've decided that you
can continue to see
Jake on one condition,

330
00:18:25,572 --> 00:18:28,372
that someone has to
be with you two always.

331
00:18:28,374 --> 00:18:31,309
-Do you understand? Always.
-[sighs]

332
00:18:32,579 --> 00:18:34,429
Yeah.

333
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:36,280
-All right?
-All right, yes.

334
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:38,716
Okay, all right then, that's
enough said about that.

335
00:18:39,586 --> 00:18:42,487
Oh, and one more thing,
don't try to sneak out together.

336
00:18:42,489 --> 00:18:45,123
I know something
about that, too.

337
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:57,502
-So, what is your favorite
part of a s'more?
-The marshmallow, definitely.

338
00:18:57,504 --> 00:18:59,170
-Really?
-Yeah.

339
00:18:59,172 --> 00:19:03,141
-How do you like it?
-Golden, perfect golden.

340
00:19:03,143 --> 00:19:04,275
-Golden?
-Yeah.

341
00:19:04,277 --> 00:19:07,211
That's a hard thing to achieve.

342
00:19:07,213 --> 00:19:12,617
Maybe for you, but I for one
am a master s'more cooker.

343
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:18,623
-How do you like it?
-Charred, not charred
actually, just not charred.

344
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:22,360
-Do you remember the other day
when we were at the beach-
-One not charred actually,

345
00:19:22,362 --> 00:19:24,362
not charred marshmallow.

346
00:19:24,364 --> 00:19:25,663
Thanks.

347
00:19:29,302 --> 00:19:30,468
Oh my God.

348
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:35,640
[Aylin's inner voice]<i> Uh-oh.</i>
<i> Well, it's golden all right.</i>

349
00:19:35,642 --> 00:19:37,475
Here, done.

350
00:19:37,911 --> 00:19:39,710
[Jessi] Oh that's mine.
get away from that.

351
00:19:44,551 --> 00:19:45,917
Ew, Jake.

352
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:48,686
-Are you okay, man?
-Oh, my God.

353
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:51,522
-Ooh, Jake.
-It's sandy.

354
00:19:52,358 --> 00:19:53,925
-Oops.
-Now give me a sandy kiss.

355
00:19:53,927 --> 00:19:56,460
- I have to give you
a sandy kiss now.
-No.

356
00:19:56,462 --> 00:19:57,929
Yeah.

357
00:19:57,930 --> 00:19:59,397
It's like brown sugar,
you'll love it.

358
00:19:59,399 --> 00:20:01,010
-No, no, no.
-[Jessi] Aylin!

359
00:20:01,011 --> 00:20:02,622
-[Jake] Come on, come.
-[Jessi] Gross.

360
00:20:02,623 --> 00:20:04,234
-[Aylin] No.
-[Riley] Jessi and Jarrod
are going with you.

361
00:20:04,237 --> 00:20:06,704
Don't be gone long or
I'll call the Coast Guard.

362
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:10,374
-I got you, I got
you. I got you.
-[mom laughs]

363
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:12,977
If you're gone too long,
I'll call the Coast Guard!

364
00:20:12,979 --> 00:20:14,679
Take a walk with me somewhere.

365
00:20:14,681 --> 00:20:16,214
I wanna show you something.

366
00:20:16,216 --> 00:20:17,499
Okay.

367
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:18,783
-You wanna go?
-Let's go.

368
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:24,555
Come on, Aylin.

369
00:20:24,958 --> 00:20:27,642
I'm not as fast as you.

370
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:30,327
-There.
-[Aylin's inner voice]<i> Thank God</i>
<i> Jessi and Jarrod ditched us.</i>

371
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:39,237
It's beautiful.

372
00:20:42,308 --> 00:20:43,774
[Jake] You know
this area's famous.

373
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:47,678
-For what, mosquitoes?
-Whooping crane.

374
00:20:48,648 --> 00:20:53,751
I think you're confusing
wildlife with a disease
from the 1800s.

375
00:20:53,753 --> 00:20:57,255
No, not whooping cough,
whooping crane.

376
00:20:57,590 --> 00:21:02,326
It's a special breed
of big awkward bird.

377
00:21:03,496 --> 00:21:06,030
How big are we talking,
like a turkey, a crow?

378
00:21:06,032 --> 00:21:11,636
Actually they get up
to five feet tall, can have
a seven foot wingspan,

379
00:21:11,638 --> 00:21:14,472
they make that
whooping noise, so.

380
00:21:14,474 --> 00:21:17,508
I'm gonna need to hear this,
can I get a demonstration?

381
00:21:19,345 --> 00:21:20,311
No.

382
00:21:21,648 --> 00:21:22,847
For the sake of science?

383
00:21:25,018 --> 00:21:26,484
Please.

384
00:21:28,021 --> 00:21:29,654
-All right.
-Only for science.

385
00:21:29,656 --> 00:21:30,821
And you can't laugh.

386
00:21:33,493 --> 00:21:36,460
Whoop whoop, whoo-oop.

387
00:21:36,462 --> 00:21:37,828
[laughs]

388
00:21:38,498 --> 00:21:39,630
All right.

389
00:21:42,802 --> 00:21:45,787
-Okay.
-All right.

390
00:21:45,788 --> 00:21:48,773
Okay, so where are these
so-called whooping cranes?
I don't see any of them.

391
00:21:48,775 --> 00:21:51,776
Probably on their way
back to Canada.

392
00:21:52,378 --> 00:21:54,645
They're like the snow birds
in your neighborhood.

393
00:21:55,048 --> 00:21:58,349
They come down here for the
winter, leave for the summer.

394
00:21:58,685 --> 00:22:03,788
-Do you think they
fly over Oklahoma?
-Yeah, they're made for life,

395
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:09,627
so their partner dies,
they probably
won't find another.

396
00:22:09,629 --> 00:22:10,828
That is sad.

397
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:13,731
They have an elaborate
courting ritual.

398
00:22:13,733 --> 00:22:18,336
-What's that like?
-They get to know each
other with a little dance.

399
00:22:18,338 --> 00:22:21,439
Kind of like how we
first met at a dance.

400
00:22:23,843 --> 00:22:25,376
I'll show you.

401
00:22:28,548 --> 00:22:31,716
First, they get to know each
other by bowing their heads.

402
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:36,487
My name's Jake, and you are?

403
00:22:36,489 --> 00:22:37,488
Aylin.

404
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:39,657
Pleased to meet you, Aylin.

405
00:22:39,659 --> 00:22:43,461
Then they start
flapping their wings.

406
00:22:43,463 --> 00:22:48,432
-Oh, is that what they do, huh?
-Just like this, come on.

407
00:22:48,434 --> 00:22:49,800
I can't court myself.

408
00:22:49,802 --> 00:22:51,635
-Oh, no, no.
-I need a partner.

409
00:22:52,705 --> 00:22:54,772
I'm not imitating a bird.

410
00:22:59,779 --> 00:23:03,514
-Like this?
-Good, yeah, you're
getting the hang of it.

411
00:23:03,916 --> 00:23:07,518
-You look very elegant.
-Oh.

412
00:23:08,855 --> 00:23:10,488
Then they jump.

413
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:15,893
And spin, spin.

414
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:20,931
-They jump again,
impress each other.
-[laughs]

415
00:23:20,933 --> 00:23:23,934
Just like that. Whoo-oop!

416
00:23:32,712 --> 00:23:34,945
They're bound forever.

417
00:23:35,915 --> 00:23:37,648
-Forever?
-Yeah.

418
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:39,850
And once their dance is done,

419
00:23:40,686 --> 00:23:46,490
they're soul mates for
life unless, you know,
something bad happens.

420
00:23:54,167 --> 00:23:55,666
I'll race you down.

421
00:23:57,603 --> 00:23:58,536
Wait.

422
00:24:02,909 --> 00:24:05,943
[Jake] All right, now that
we've had our science lesson,

423
00:24:05,945 --> 00:24:08,479
it's time to show
you my top secret base.

424
00:24:08,481 --> 00:24:09,180
Oh.

425
00:24:09,182 --> 00:24:10,514
Not done yet.

426
00:24:10,516 --> 00:24:12,716
Welcome to Area 52.

427
00:24:12,919 --> 00:24:16,220
-That sounds dangerous.
-You're going in.

428
00:24:16,222 --> 00:24:18,923
[Aylin] Very interesting,
excuse you.

429
00:24:18,925 --> 00:24:22,526
[Jake] Not so much dangerous
as much as secretive.

430
00:24:22,995 --> 00:24:25,996
[Aylin's inner voice]
<i> This is so romantic.</i>

431
00:24:26,632 --> 00:24:28,799
[Aylin] God, these
sand dunes are huge.

432
00:24:28,801 --> 00:24:29,834
Wow.

433
00:24:29,836 --> 00:24:34,872
It still hasn't changed.
You know I haven't taken
anyone here in years.

434
00:24:37,844 --> 00:24:38,776
You're gonna love it.

435
00:24:42,215 --> 00:24:44,382
I already do.

436
00:24:44,383 --> 00:24:46,550
All right, be careful,
it's a little slippery.

437
00:24:46,552 --> 00:24:47,751
I can tell.

438
00:24:51,757 --> 00:24:56,093
[Jake] My brother and I used
to run up and down these dunes.

439
00:24:56,829 --> 00:25:01,632
It was like our little
secret slice of paradise.

440
00:25:02,235 --> 00:25:07,872
When he died, all I ever
wanted to do was forget.

441
00:25:13,012 --> 00:25:17,781
But now, with you here,

442
00:25:20,887 --> 00:25:23,587
I feel like I can do anything.

443
00:25:51,784 --> 00:25:53,551
[man] Are you Jake and Aylin?

444
00:25:53,986 --> 00:25:56,887
You kids have any idea how much
trouble you've caused tonight?

445
00:25:56,889 --> 00:25:59,156
My mom's gonna be
so worried, I gotta go.

446
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:02,026
-[mom] Aylin!
-Mom.

447
00:26:02,028 --> 00:26:06,030
-Oh God! Are you all right?
-Yeah I'm okay.

448
00:26:06,032 --> 00:26:07,565
I was so worried.

449
00:26:07,567 --> 00:26:09,066
We just fell asleep
at the beach.

450
00:26:09,569 --> 00:26:11,635
-You guys, where have they been?
-[mom] Come on.

451
00:26:11,637 --> 00:26:13,103
They'll be here, relax.

452
00:26:14,974 --> 00:26:18,142
Jakey and Aylin.

453
00:26:19,745 --> 00:26:22,146
You drive, I'm too
tired. Come on, girls.

454
00:26:24,784 --> 00:26:27,985
Oh, y'all are in trouble.

455
00:26:27,987 --> 00:26:31,755
[Riley] Are you okay?
You're mom's going insane,
I can't take it anymore.

456
00:26:31,757 --> 00:26:33,624
Well, where you been, man?

457
00:26:37,897 --> 00:26:40,064
At the expense of
sounding too cliché,

458
00:26:45,104 --> 00:26:47,605
I think I fell in love
tonight, Jarrod.

459
00:26:48,874 --> 00:26:52,943
Okay, well I'm
driving, so let's go.

460
00:26:55,014 --> 00:26:56,146
The keys.

461
00:27:08,694 --> 00:27:09,860
Hey, Aylin!

462
00:27:12,832 --> 00:27:14,732
I love you!

463
00:27:14,733 --> 00:27:16,633
-[Jessi] Whoo!
-[mom] Aylin, get in
the car now, please.

464
00:27:16,636 --> 00:27:19,370
[Jessi] Oh my God, he loves you.

465
00:27:19,372 --> 00:27:23,007
-[Riley] Get it girl!
-[Jarrod] All right, come
on, lover boy, let's go.

466
00:27:23,009 --> 00:27:24,775
[Jessi] Bye, Jake.

467
00:27:25,978 --> 00:27:29,413
[Aylin's inner voice]
[sighs]<i> I really messed up.</i>

468
00:27:29,415 --> 00:27:31,815
<i> I'm in way over my head.</i>

469
00:27:35,788 --> 00:27:39,957
I'm psyched to get to the
beach, gotta be catching
some rays today for sure.

470
00:27:39,959 --> 00:27:42,092
Did you girls put on
enough sunblock?

471
00:27:42,094 --> 00:27:44,395
Well, how am I supposed
to tan if I wear sunscreen?

472
00:27:44,397 --> 00:27:47,131
Jessi, you have to
put on sunscreen
or you'll burn to a crisp.

473
00:27:47,133 --> 00:27:48,265
I never burn.

474
00:27:48,267 --> 00:27:51,869
Aylin, I thought you'd be
excited to go to the beach.

475
00:27:51,871 --> 00:27:53,671
I heard Jake say he'd be there.

476
00:27:53,673 --> 00:27:54,772
I am.

477
00:27:55,141 --> 00:27:56,707
[mom] Well, you
don't look like it.

478
00:27:56,709 --> 00:27:58,108
Yeah, you're acting
kind of weird.

479
00:27:58,110 --> 00:27:59,076
Mom.

480
00:27:59,779 --> 00:28:00,911
Yes?

481
00:28:00,913 --> 00:28:05,115
-There's something I
actually need to tell you.
-What is it?

482
00:28:06,852 --> 00:28:09,019
-What?
-I told Jake I was 18.

483
00:28:09,021 --> 00:28:13,857
What? He's crazy about
you, everyone saw
the way he looks at you.

484
00:28:14,126 --> 00:28:16,794
Don't make me feel any
worse than I already do.

485
00:28:16,796 --> 00:28:18,162
I didn't think it would matter.

486
00:28:18,164 --> 00:28:20,097
Well, being dishonest
always matters.

487
00:28:20,733 --> 00:28:21,865
I know.

488
00:28:21,867 --> 00:28:25,903
You've got to tell Jake
that you're not old enough.

489
00:28:25,905 --> 00:28:29,139
[mom] Jake needs to know
you're not 18, you need
to tell him right away.

490
00:28:29,442 --> 00:28:32,243
No, you've got
to tell him today.

491
00:28:32,244 --> 00:28:35,045
And if it goes wrong we
can just go to another beach.

492
00:28:36,148 --> 00:28:37,281
You've gotta tell him.

493
00:28:38,718 --> 00:28:41,285
Okay.

494
00:28:41,286 --> 00:28:43,853
[Aylin's inner voice]
<i> Okay, at least mom doesn't</i>
<i> know about my fake ID.</i>

495
00:28:46,125 --> 00:28:47,991
[girls cheering]

496
00:28:50,863 --> 00:28:52,296
[mom] We have arrived.

497
00:28:54,934 --> 00:28:56,967
We have arrived.

498
00:28:58,237 --> 00:29:02,072
-Hey, don't forget what
we talked about, promise?
-I know.

499
00:29:06,045 --> 00:29:07,578
-[Jessi] Hey, guys.
-[Jarrod] Hey, ladies.

500
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:09,112
-[Jessi] Hey, Jarrod.
-[mom] Well, hello.

501
00:29:09,782 --> 00:29:12,500
[Natalie] Perfect day
for the beach.

502
00:29:12,501 --> 00:29:15,219
Bet it will be crawling with
kids. What do you think, Aylin?

503
00:29:16,222 --> 00:29:18,922
I think it'll be fine,
it's a big beach.

504
00:29:18,924 --> 00:29:23,861
Oh I think one kid will
practically be on top
of us. Don't you agree?

505
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:26,930
Well, Jessi, I'm sure
there'll be plenty of children,

506
00:29:26,932 --> 00:29:30,234
but I'm pretty sure there'll
be plenty of assholes too.

507
00:29:32,505 --> 00:29:33,337
Whatever.

508
00:29:39,845 --> 00:29:41,011
What was that all about?

509
00:29:43,549 --> 00:29:45,015
I don't know.

510
00:29:46,018 --> 00:29:47,785
[laughing]

511
00:29:52,258 --> 00:29:53,323
Hey.

512
00:29:53,926 --> 00:29:55,543
Hey.

513
00:29:55,544 --> 00:29:57,161
Everything okay?
You seem a little quiet.

514
00:29:58,998 --> 00:30:00,330
Jake, we need to talk.

515
00:30:02,334 --> 00:30:03,333
Okay.

516
00:30:04,937 --> 00:30:06,937
-What's up?
-No, not here.

517
00:30:06,939 --> 00:30:08,338
Not with all of this around.

518
00:30:10,142 --> 00:30:11,041
Yeah.

519
00:30:13,345 --> 00:30:14,978
Can we go somewhere private?

520
00:30:15,347 --> 00:30:16,280
Um...

521
00:30:18,117 --> 00:30:21,218
The ice cream shop.
Let me grab my shirt.

522
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:22,386
I'll be right back.

523
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:28,025
I can't believe the ice
cream shop is closed.

524
00:30:28,027 --> 00:30:31,328
-What's goin' on?
-Listen, I just thought
it would be a fun night,

525
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:36,567
we'd go out and dance
and sing, and then we'd
go our separate ways.

526
00:30:36,569 --> 00:30:39,169
But you came over and
we just had this great time.

527
00:30:39,171 --> 00:30:44,875
Aylin, it's okay. You can
tell me, whatever it is.

528
00:30:47,947 --> 00:30:49,847
I'm really actually 16.

529
00:30:52,918 --> 00:30:53,884
What?

530
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,954
I'm really sorry, Jake.

531
00:30:57,590 --> 00:30:58,422
Oh.

532
00:31:00,593 --> 00:31:02,459
Wow, um.

533
00:31:03,195 --> 00:31:04,261
[sighs]

534
00:31:05,097 --> 00:31:06,129
Um.

535
00:31:11,136 --> 00:31:13,170
You really do look
older than that.

536
00:31:13,172 --> 00:31:15,973
I know, I should have
said something sooner.

537
00:31:19,612 --> 00:31:20,544
All right.

538
00:31:23,215 --> 00:31:24,915
Here's the way I look at it.

539
00:31:27,086 --> 00:31:30,387
The age difference thing
is not that big of an issue.

540
00:31:30,389 --> 00:31:35,058
-So, you don't
care I'm only 16?
-Well, no, I care.

541
00:31:35,628 --> 00:31:38,362
It's where we are in our
lives that's the problem.

542
00:31:38,364 --> 00:31:39,429
I mean, you,

543
00:31:39,431 --> 00:31:44,101
still have to finish
high school and I've
already done all that.

544
00:31:44,103 --> 00:31:46,370
Yeah.

545
00:31:46,371 --> 00:31:48,638
-And I can't ever
go back again, I just--
-Yeah, I know.

546
00:31:48,641 --> 00:31:52,643
Plus, I think everyone
would look at me as
that creepy old guy,

547
00:31:52,645 --> 00:31:55,012
and I don't want to be that guy.

548
00:31:55,648 --> 00:31:59,316
I would have never even
gone for you if I would have
thought you were that young.

549
00:32:01,453 --> 00:32:05,188
-Yeah.
-I mean, what'd everybody think?

550
00:32:06,058 --> 00:32:07,057
You know?

551
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:10,360
You want to get out
of here? Come on.

552
00:32:10,362 --> 00:32:12,262
[Aylin's inner voice]
<i> This doesn't look good.</i>

553
00:32:13,165 --> 00:32:15,966
<i> Okay, just smile and act</i>
<i> like nothing happened.</i>

554
00:32:15,968 --> 00:32:18,068
See, I'm not a cherry
person, though.

555
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:21,471
Do you want a cherry?

556
00:32:24,276 --> 00:32:28,045
Oh, I can't believe I forgot
to put on sunscreen.

557
00:32:28,047 --> 00:32:32,082
No joke. Look how
nice my skin looks.

558
00:32:32,084 --> 00:32:33,216
Oh.

559
00:32:33,218 --> 00:32:36,136
Lou Anne, honey, why
don't you go on home?

560
00:32:36,137 --> 00:32:39,055
-I think the guys can
give us a ride, right?
-Oh yeah, no problem.

561
00:32:39,491 --> 00:32:43,160
I could use a cold
shower and aloe vera,
so thank you very much.

562
00:32:43,162 --> 00:32:44,394
-[mom] Bye, kids.
-[Jessi] Bye, Lou Anne.

563
00:32:44,396 --> 00:32:45,362
Bye, Mom.

564
00:32:51,203 --> 00:32:52,269
Wow.

565
00:32:53,238 --> 00:32:54,104
It's good.

566
00:32:57,076 --> 00:32:58,141
I'll be right back.

567
00:33:04,016 --> 00:33:05,148
Okay, I got to get in.

568
00:33:05,417 --> 00:33:07,084
Yummy.

569
00:33:07,386 --> 00:33:09,186
Take my fork, take my fork.

570
00:33:09,187 --> 00:33:10,987
-That looks so good.
-Anybody wants this cherry?

571
00:33:28,374 --> 00:33:29,172
Hey.

572
00:33:32,244 --> 00:33:33,243
Hi.

573
00:33:34,346 --> 00:33:35,178
What's up?

574
00:33:39,184 --> 00:33:40,150
Nothing.

575
00:33:41,387 --> 00:33:43,553
That does not look like nothing.

576
00:33:44,189 --> 00:33:45,355
I'm just thinking.

577
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:49,559
Is it about earlier?

578
00:33:50,295 --> 00:33:51,461
[sighs] Yeah.

579
00:33:51,463 --> 00:34:00,504
A hundred years ago it
wouldn't matter, but today's
day and age it's different.

580
00:34:04,176 --> 00:34:09,079
It's not normal, it's looked
down upon, it's rejected.

581
00:34:09,081 --> 00:34:10,080
I know that.

582
00:34:12,518 --> 00:34:14,184
It just feels right.

583
00:34:18,490 --> 00:34:20,390
But society says it's wrong.

584
00:34:22,127 --> 00:34:23,527
Jake, it's fate.

585
00:34:24,563 --> 00:34:25,595
Simple as that.

586
00:34:28,067 --> 00:34:31,869
I'd like to think that.

587
00:34:31,870 --> 00:34:35,672
[Aylin's inner voice]
<i>This is fate, but can he really</i>
<i> get over the age thing?</i>

588
00:34:39,511 --> 00:34:40,811
So.

589
00:34:40,813 --> 00:34:42,546
-So?
-I have something
I want you to hear.

590
00:34:42,548 --> 00:34:44,481
-You do?
-Mhmm, yeah.

591
00:34:47,619 --> 00:34:50,120
¶¶¶

592
00:34:51,457 --> 00:34:53,824
This is the song
from the other night.

593
00:34:53,826 --> 00:34:58,095
<i> ¶ Summer days</i>
<i> When you walked in ¶</i>

594
00:34:58,097 --> 00:35:01,631
I kind of think of it as our
song. I wouldn't forget.

595
00:35:04,269 --> 00:35:05,335
Me too.

596
00:35:06,271 --> 00:35:07,270
Here.

597
00:35:09,374 --> 00:35:12,175
I made you a copy,

598
00:35:12,177 --> 00:35:16,379
but you have to remember
to think of me every
time you play it, deal?

599
00:35:16,381 --> 00:35:18,682
-Every single time?
-Yeah.

600
00:35:19,351 --> 00:35:20,383
Deal.

601
00:35:34,266 --> 00:35:37,567
[Jake] She just does,
she does it for me. She
makes me want to feel.

602
00:35:37,569 --> 00:35:39,703
I can't believe you said
you love her, though.

603
00:35:40,305 --> 00:35:41,371
Too soon.

604
00:35:41,373 --> 00:35:44,141
I feel like I can fly.

605
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:46,910
Natalie, why don't you go
to your room? Your mother
and I need to talk to Jake.

606
00:35:46,912 --> 00:35:48,545
Oh, okay.

607
00:35:51,350 --> 00:35:52,582
I'm gonna go chill
in your room, man.

608
00:35:52,584 --> 00:35:54,384
Okay. See you around.

609
00:35:54,887 --> 00:35:56,186
Hey, guys.

610
00:35:57,890 --> 00:35:59,156
You're home early.

611
00:36:01,193 --> 00:36:01,925
What's going on?

612
00:36:01,927 --> 00:36:04,194
Well, you tell us
what's going on.

613
00:36:04,663 --> 00:36:06,463
'Cause you see,
Natalie called us.

614
00:36:06,899 --> 00:36:09,432
She said that you were
too busy to talk to her.

615
00:36:10,169 --> 00:36:11,635
Thought we'd like to know
what you'd been up to.

616
00:36:11,637 --> 00:36:14,171
Told us about a friend of yours.

617
00:36:15,174 --> 00:36:17,207
-What was her name?
-Aylin.

618
00:36:17,209 --> 00:36:18,909
Ah, yes, Aylin.

619
00:36:18,911 --> 00:36:21,778
And I heard she led you to
believe she was much older.

620
00:36:22,915 --> 00:36:24,514
-[sighs]
-[dad] Jake.

621
00:36:24,516 --> 00:36:26,533
Yeah.

622
00:36:26,534 --> 00:36:28,551
A girl that will lie about
her age is up to no good.

623
00:36:28,554 --> 00:36:31,038
You just need to
forget about her.

624
00:36:31,039 --> 00:36:33,523
No, Doug, I don't need to
forget her, that's ridiculous.

625
00:36:33,525 --> 00:36:37,294
Don't disrespect
your father, he is just
trying to protect you.

626
00:36:37,296 --> 00:36:42,432
Mom, I like this girl.
I mean I really like this girl.

627
00:36:42,434 --> 00:36:44,701
Like, like?

628
00:36:44,703 --> 00:36:50,273
Jake, I'm not gonna let
you piss off your future on
some hussy you met down

629
00:36:50,275 --> 00:36:51,741
on the beach. You hear me?

630
00:36:52,477 --> 00:36:54,027
You don't even know her.

631
00:36:54,028 --> 00:36:55,578
[dad] You're going
to Med School, Jake.

632
00:36:56,315 --> 00:36:57,647
You owe it to your brother.

633
00:36:57,649 --> 00:37:03,553
You know I have spent
the last six years feeling
responsible for his death.

634
00:37:03,555 --> 00:37:07,557
Your brother's death has
nothing to do with this girl.

635
00:37:07,559 --> 00:37:08,658
But it does.

636
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:16,499
Mom, ever since we lost
Donnie, I have not been able
to focus on anything else.

637
00:37:16,501 --> 00:37:18,602
And she makes me
feel something, Mom.

638
00:37:18,604 --> 00:37:21,638
She makes me feel
something, right here.

639
00:37:24,309 --> 00:37:25,242
Love?

640
00:37:25,244 --> 00:37:30,680
If you decide to see this
girl again, there will be no
help from us with Med School.

641
00:37:30,682 --> 00:37:34,517
You can't just take that
away from me, that is
what I have worked for,

642
00:37:34,519 --> 00:37:39,322
my motivation, my
ambition, my drive,
everything goes back to that.

643
00:37:39,324 --> 00:37:41,825
Well, then you know how
God damned serious we are.

644
00:37:42,761 --> 00:37:45,595
She's leaving tomorrow.
Can I at least say goodbye?

645
00:37:46,732 --> 00:37:51,001
Hand over your phone
and the keys to your truck.
Come on, hand them over.

646
00:37:51,003 --> 00:37:53,703
Doug, I'm not going to give
you my phone and keys.

647
00:37:53,705 --> 00:38:00,543
If you want my help with Med
School, we're going to do this
my way. Hand them over.

648
00:38:03,348 --> 00:38:07,350
I hope you feel good,
'cause I don't think
I can ever forgive you.

649
00:38:08,754 --> 00:38:10,553
And you're not even my dad.

650
00:38:12,357 --> 00:38:15,558
You know what? I can't.

651
00:38:37,783 --> 00:38:38,848
Hey.

652
00:38:40,052 --> 00:38:40,817
Hey.

653
00:38:40,819 --> 00:38:42,786
We're all packed up to leave.

654
00:38:42,788 --> 00:38:47,457
-How are you holding
up out here?
-He didn't show.

655
00:38:49,328 --> 00:38:52,329
Yeah, well, it's okay.

656
00:38:52,597 --> 00:38:54,731
He wasn't tall enough
for you anyways.

657
00:38:58,370 --> 00:39:02,806
Aylin, if it's any consolation,
he made a huge mistake.

658
00:39:02,808 --> 00:39:04,841
[mom] Come on, time to go.

659
00:39:04,843 --> 00:39:06,743
We have a long
drive ahead of us.

660
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:10,347
Come on, let's go home.

661
00:39:14,086 --> 00:39:15,352
'Morning.

662
00:39:16,421 --> 00:39:17,620
Yeah, 'morning, man.

663
00:39:21,093 --> 00:39:22,859
What do you need
spare keys for, man?

664
00:39:23,895 --> 00:39:25,462
I'm gonna go see Aylin.

665
00:39:25,464 --> 00:39:27,430
Well, you better
take the back roads.

666
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:29,866
You're busted for sure
if you go the usual way,

667
00:39:30,702 --> 00:39:32,469
especially with Nat out there.

668
00:39:33,638 --> 00:39:34,571
I'm just saying.

669
00:39:37,776 --> 00:39:39,142
I appreciate that.

670
00:39:39,144 --> 00:39:40,844
Not a problem, man,
that's what I'm here for.

671
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:42,645
See you.

672
00:39:43,682 --> 00:39:44,814
Have a good one.

673
00:39:46,118 --> 00:39:51,654
<i>¶ This feeling inside of my soul</i>
<i> Is killing me ¶</i>

674
00:39:57,863 --> 00:40:03,533
<i> ¶ There is no reason left</i>
<i> Anymore for me to breathe ¶</i>

675
00:40:09,875 --> 00:40:18,148
<i> ¶ In my mind I know it's over</i>
<i>now I need to get away somehow ¶</i>

676
00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:23,019
<i>¶ This feeling inside of my soul</i>
<i> Is killing me ¶</i>

677
00:41:01,927 --> 00:41:04,961
Come on.

678
00:41:04,962 --> 00:41:07,996
<i> ¶ I can hear some voice</i>
<i> That's calling me ¶</i>

679
00:41:10,001 --> 00:41:15,538
<i> ¶ They say it's all</i>
<i> For me to be free ¶</i>

680
00:41:17,976 --> 00:41:21,945
<i> ¶ And I know</i>
<i> There won't be another way ¶</i>

681
00:41:21,947 --> 00:41:26,216
<i> ¶ There is nothing left</i>
<i> For me to say ¶</i>

682
00:41:26,218 --> 00:41:32,021
<i> ¶ I can hear some voice</i>

683
00:41:33,558 --> 00:41:36,559
[Aylin]<i> Jake, if you</i>
<i> read this note,</i>

684
00:41:36,561 --> 00:41:41,231
<i> I hope you know I waited for</i>

685
00:41:41,233 --> 00:41:43,099
<i> begging to God</i>
<i> that you would come,</i>

686
00:41:43,935 --> 00:41:48,671
<i> pull up in your beat up old</i>

687
00:41:49,241 --> 00:41:54,010
<i> You need to know</i>
<i> that the moment I met</i>
<i> you, I fell deeply in love,</i>

688
00:41:54,946 --> 00:42:01,284
<i> and you know the honest</i>
<i> truth when I say that time</i>
<i> will never be an issue for us</i>

689
00:42:01,286 --> 00:42:05,822
<i> because in the end</i>
<i> I know I'll be with you.</i>

690
00:42:06,725 --> 00:42:07,924
<i> Forever.</i>

691
00:42:10,262 --> 00:42:11,728
<i> Love, Aylin.</i>

692
00:42:22,307 --> 00:42:24,707
[beeps]

693
00:42:33,985 --> 00:42:37,687
I'm actually a fan of the
plastic bags. We recycle.

694
00:42:37,689 --> 00:42:39,756
Mike and I recycle, we're
not part of the problem.

695
00:42:39,758 --> 00:42:42,825
-[woman] Absolutely.
-But I did hear that they
were gonna try to ban

696
00:42:42,827 --> 00:42:45,845
the plastic bags.

697
00:42:45,846 --> 00:42:48,864
We recycle ours, we don't
use them for all kinds of
things and it's just not fair

698
00:42:48,867 --> 00:42:50,833
they're gonna be taking
them away from us.

699
00:42:50,835 --> 00:42:56,005
[woman] We just felt like
the community wanted that,
and it's good for us as well.

700
00:42:57,842 --> 00:43:02,612
[employee] I hear
the film premier sold
out in only two hours.

701
00:43:04,950 --> 00:43:10,353
-Excuse me?
-I said, her new movie
premier sold out in two hours.

702
00:43:10,355 --> 00:43:13,990
It's going to be in Austin,
but everybody knows that.

703
00:43:13,992 --> 00:43:16,826
Well, I'll be damned. She
actually did it, didn't she?

704
00:43:17,329 --> 00:43:20,363
Why would you say that,
like you knew her or something?

705
00:43:20,365 --> 00:43:23,132
Oh, well, actually I did.

706
00:43:23,134 --> 00:43:26,169
Aylin? Dude, she is hot.

707
00:43:26,905 --> 00:43:29,772
So, what you guys go
on a date or something?

708
00:43:29,774 --> 00:43:34,110
Yeah, yeah, it was a long
time ago though, you know.

709
00:43:35,146 --> 00:43:36,846
Didn't really mean anything.

710
00:43:37,649 --> 00:43:39,215
[Aylin]<i> Here I am in Hollywood.</i>

711
00:43:39,217 --> 00:43:46,789
<i> I'm told I have everything,</i>
<i> great job, an exceptionally</i>
<i> attractive boyfriend,</i>

712
00:43:46,791 --> 00:43:50,793
<i> fans, and even one very</i>
<i> enthusiastic stalker.</i>

713
00:43:50,795 --> 00:43:52,895
<i> Something is missing though.</i>

714
00:43:52,897 --> 00:43:56,633
<i> The girl with everything</i>
<i> feels nothing.</i>

715
00:43:56,635 --> 00:44:01,738
Oh, cheese and rice, looks
like somebody didn't get
enough beauty sleep last night.

716
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:02,705
Thanks.

717
00:44:02,707 --> 00:44:05,408
You are a hot mess.

718
00:44:05,410 --> 00:44:10,013
I know. I'm sorry, I couldn't
fall asleep last night.

719
00:44:10,849 --> 00:44:12,882
Maybe it's like the legend.

720
00:44:13,184 --> 00:44:14,250
What legend?

721
00:44:14,252 --> 00:44:19,989
You know the one that says,
you can't sleep because you're
awake in somebody else's dream.

722
00:44:19,991 --> 00:44:22,425
Sorry, haven't heard
that one before.

723
00:44:22,427 --> 00:44:25,161
Let's just hope you weren't
awake in B-jorn's dream.

724
00:44:25,163 --> 00:44:26,029
Bjorn.

725
00:44:26,031 --> 00:44:27,196
Whatever.

726
00:44:28,733 --> 00:44:31,100
Oh my God, speak of the devil.

727
00:44:31,102 --> 00:44:33,236
Are all of his Snapchats
of that variety?

728
00:44:34,005 --> 00:44:38,975
[sighs] I don't know,
I guess I'm lonely
and Bjorn helps a little.

729
00:44:38,977 --> 00:44:45,748
But you're not alone. You
have your mom and Katrina
and Riley and Jessi and me,

730
00:44:45,750 --> 00:44:48,017
-and all the crew.
-I know, I know, it's just,

731
00:44:48,853 --> 00:44:51,721
I don't know I want somebody
I can have a future with

732
00:44:52,057 --> 00:44:56,759
and I can't meet anybody new
because I'm always on location.

733
00:44:56,761 --> 00:45:03,166
Sister, what you need is a
vacation, not a lo-cation.

734
00:45:03,435 --> 00:45:06,002
Go somewhere where you
can have some you time.

735
00:45:06,438 --> 00:45:10,223
That does sound nice.

736
00:45:10,224 --> 00:45:14,009
Except there's one problem
with that. I can't go anywhere
without somebody recognizing me.

737
00:45:14,012 --> 00:45:18,214
How would you like to be
a red head? [growling]

738
00:45:19,050 --> 00:45:20,917
That might be fun.

739
00:45:25,090 --> 00:45:29,025
This is just what
the doctor ordered.

740
00:45:29,027 --> 00:45:30,026
[laughing]

741
00:45:30,028 --> 00:45:33,262
There. Oh, it's perfection.

742
00:45:33,264 --> 00:45:36,132
-Look at you.
-Good morning.

743
00:45:36,935 --> 00:45:38,067
Hi.

744
00:45:38,470 --> 00:45:40,203
Fantastic.

745
00:45:40,205 --> 00:45:41,804
Oh, honey.

746
00:45:41,806 --> 00:45:44,490
[Aylin] Don't need to say it.

747
00:45:44,491 --> 00:45:47,175
What have you been up to?
You look like you've
been in a boxing ring.

748
00:45:49,013 --> 00:45:50,947
How's your stalker guy?

749
00:46:00,959 --> 00:46:04,093
You simply won't believe
the day we've had.

750
00:46:04,095 --> 00:46:08,131
Two clients backed out on
a contract and one renter
basically trashed a house

751
00:46:08,133 --> 00:46:10,900
so we have to go in and
do a complete remodel.

752
00:46:10,902 --> 00:46:12,902
This day is costing
us a fortune.

753
00:46:12,904 --> 00:46:15,271
Waiter, bring us your best Cav.

754
00:46:16,107 --> 00:46:19,976
Anyways, enough about
me, how have you been?

755
00:46:19,978 --> 00:46:24,247
Well, Dionte and Katrina want me
to start going out in disguise.

756
00:46:24,249 --> 00:46:26,249
As you can see
I'm trying it out.

757
00:46:26,251 --> 00:46:29,185
Oh, they even gave me this wig.

758
00:46:29,988 --> 00:46:34,891
Why didn't you wear it today?
Would have been better than that
sorry ass hat you're wearing.

759
00:46:34,893 --> 00:46:37,093
No, your hat is fine, I like it.

760
00:46:37,095 --> 00:46:40,863
Thank you, and it's all I
had time for this morning.

761
00:46:40,865 --> 00:46:43,099
I've seen a bit about
you in the tabloids.

762
00:46:43,101 --> 00:46:47,537
Bjorn, huh? Nice butt,
and those abs.

763
00:46:47,539 --> 00:46:52,275
Honestly, I struggle with
taking guys seriously
when he's prettier than I am.

764
00:46:52,277 --> 00:46:56,279
Personally I go by
the philosophy of use
them and lose them.

765
00:46:56,281 --> 00:46:58,581
There's too many hotties out
there to choose just one.

766
00:46:58,583 --> 00:47:00,950
Don't listen to her, Aylin,
she doesn't mean that.

767
00:47:01,953 --> 00:47:06,889
Like hell I don't.
Whoo, see what I mean?

768
00:47:06,891 --> 00:47:10,293
There are so many
of these creatures
wandering around out there.

769
00:47:10,295 --> 00:47:12,094
One man's enough for me.

770
00:47:12,564 --> 00:47:14,831
I agree, one good
one's all you need.

771
00:47:16,935 --> 00:47:18,234
There you are, ma'am.

772
00:47:19,304 --> 00:47:22,305
And for you, Miss? Aylin?

773
00:47:22,307 --> 00:47:24,273
Oh my God, it is you.

774
00:47:27,579 --> 00:47:29,345
Can I get your autograph?

775
00:47:29,346 --> 00:47:31,112
-Who do you-- who do you
want me to make this out to?
-Marty.

776
00:47:31,115 --> 00:47:37,053
And if you could say thanks
for the fabulous service,
I enjoyed every minute of it.

777
00:47:37,055 --> 00:47:38,387
Aylin.

778
00:47:38,389 --> 00:47:40,056
[Jessi] Actually, we got to go.

779
00:47:40,058 --> 00:47:41,991
-I've got to go, I'm sorry.
-Come on.

780
00:47:41,993 --> 00:47:44,193
Get out of our--
get out of our way.

781
00:47:47,232 --> 00:47:48,965
[Aylin] Oh, Jesus.

782
00:47:49,934 --> 00:47:51,133
[Riley] Ladies, please.

783
00:47:59,177 --> 00:48:04,280
All right. How are you
doing today, Mr. Linch?

784
00:48:04,282 --> 00:48:05,915
I've been better.

785
00:48:05,917 --> 00:48:08,317
Looks like you had a little
fishing accident today.

786
00:48:08,620 --> 00:48:11,054
Think you can tell me about it?

787
00:48:11,055 --> 00:48:13,489
My buddy's fishing off
the back, and I'm facing
the other direction

788
00:48:14,058 --> 00:48:19,362
and just as he was
casting, the wind caught his
line and well, look here.

789
00:48:19,364 --> 00:48:23,499
Got myself an accidental nipple
piercing and I can't get it out.

790
00:48:24,168 --> 00:48:26,168
Well, look at that.

791
00:48:26,169 --> 00:48:28,169
Looks like your buddy
caught the big one today.

792
00:48:28,172 --> 00:48:31,140
I seen the girls on TV with
piercings all over them,

793
00:48:31,142 --> 00:48:33,626
they even have them
through their tongue.

794
00:48:33,627 --> 00:48:36,111
Now tell me, how can you
eat with something like
that in your mouth?

795
00:48:36,114 --> 00:48:39,916
-Tell me, how can you?
-Well, I don't know,
I'm just saying

796
00:48:40,652 --> 00:48:42,251
if it was ever a time to do it.

797
00:48:44,989 --> 00:48:47,323
-Are you sure?
-Damn sure.

798
00:48:47,325 --> 00:48:49,125
Get this thing out.

799
00:48:49,994 --> 00:48:51,060
Ow!

800
00:48:53,998 --> 00:48:57,400
I need anesthetic room
four, I'll be there in a
couple minutes, okay?

801
00:48:57,402 --> 00:49:00,403
-Hey, nipple piercing, huh?
-Yeah.

802
00:49:00,405 --> 00:49:02,922
They're so hot on guys.

803
00:49:02,923 --> 00:49:05,440
-Can I play with it?
-Well, it's too late,
we already took it out.

804
00:49:06,177 --> 00:49:10,246
Such a little fun sucker, aren't
you? You know I'm thinking of
getting one of those myself,

805
00:49:10,248 --> 00:49:15,117
-maybe both with rings.
What do you think?
-Uh...

806
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:17,687
By the way, have you seen
the waiting room lately?

807
00:49:17,689 --> 00:49:20,006
No.

808
00:49:20,007 --> 00:49:22,324
Be prepared, there are
heaps of people coming
in with jellyfish stings.

809
00:49:22,327 --> 00:49:26,295
I see yearly jellyfish
invasions taking dozens
of poor innocent tourists,

810
00:49:26,297 --> 00:49:28,297
happens every year,
Janelle, you know this.

811
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,067
So much for a quiet little
practice by the sea.

812
00:49:31,069 --> 00:49:36,706
Hey, doctor, since you'll must
likely be here late tonight.

813
00:49:36,708 --> 00:49:40,042
Don't know how many
times I need to tell you,
I don't date my staff, okay?

814
00:49:40,378 --> 00:49:44,380
There's always a
first, you know, date.

815
00:49:47,185 --> 00:49:49,085
There we go, Aylin's lost
love connection, page eight.

816
00:49:54,292 --> 00:49:57,293
"All the hoopla over
Aylin's glitzy romance
has come to an end

817
00:49:57,295 --> 00:50:00,062
after her infamous
breakup with Bjorn."

818
00:50:01,766 --> 00:50:03,566
Bjorn. Never heard of him.

819
00:50:03,568 --> 00:50:09,205
The guy looks like the
biggest tool bag I've
ever seen, oh my God.

828
00:50:42,106 --> 00:50:44,457

840
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:26,148
This is who she dates?
I mean come on.

841
00:51:27,318 --> 00:51:29,218
Accessorizing dogs.

842
00:51:35,259 --> 00:51:38,227
You know I haven't seen
Bjorn in a couple weeks.

843
00:51:38,830 --> 00:51:44,266
I thought things would
slow down filming, but in all
honesty, it's just sped up.

844
00:51:44,569 --> 00:51:48,404
They have me flying out
to an interview in the morning,
but that same night

845
00:51:48,406 --> 00:51:52,274
they're sending me across
the country to a talk show.

846
00:51:52,276 --> 00:51:53,476
Oh God.

847
00:51:53,478 --> 00:51:59,281
I know it's what the job
calls for but I really wish
they would lighten the load.

848
00:51:59,283 --> 00:52:02,485
Tell them to back off,
you're working yourself silly.

849
00:52:04,455 --> 00:52:07,189
You should see the tabloids
about me right now.

850
00:52:07,191 --> 00:52:10,126
Girls, why did you girls
talk me into this?

851
00:52:11,195 --> 00:52:14,296
You know what they
say, Mom. You gotta
use it or lose it.

852
00:52:14,298 --> 00:52:16,565
That depends on what
you're looking for.

853
00:52:16,567 --> 00:52:18,400
I gotta find a towel.

854
00:52:32,350 --> 00:52:35,351
[scream]

855
00:52:35,352 --> 00:52:38,353
Help! Somebody call 911!
There's a lady on the ground
in the locker room.

856
00:52:42,260 --> 00:52:46,662
[priest] For none of us has life
in himself and becomes his
own master when he dies.

857
00:52:47,365 --> 00:52:53,669
Or if we have life, we were
alive in the Lord. If we
die, we die in the Lord.

858
00:52:54,605 --> 00:53:00,176
So, then whether we
live or die, we are the
Lord's possessions.

859
00:53:00,645 --> 00:53:03,445
Happy from now on are
those who die in the Lord.

860
00:53:04,649 --> 00:53:08,617
So it is says the spirit, for
they rest from their labors.

861
00:53:10,688 --> 00:53:16,625
No, no, no, she is so beautiful
but why-- why is her picture
bigger than mine?

862
00:53:18,396 --> 00:53:23,966
No, without Fred there is no
Ginger, they're saying this
glam duo is donezo.

863
00:53:23,968 --> 00:53:27,670
No, we're not donezo,
I'm heading over to
her funeral right now,

864
00:53:27,672 --> 00:53:29,772
so I'm gonna take
time away from filming.

865
00:53:30,341 --> 00:53:32,908
I don't care.

866
00:53:32,909 --> 00:53:35,476
I'm gonna go be by her
shoulder in her hour of need.

867
00:53:37,215 --> 00:53:40,316
No, I don't know who died,
what does that matter?
What matters is publicity.

868
00:53:40,318 --> 00:53:43,219
I get publicity, she gets
publicity, everybody's happy.

869
00:53:43,221 --> 00:53:45,688
The reporters will be there,
I will be there by her side,

870
00:53:45,690 --> 00:53:48,524
they will love me, they
will love her, end of story.

871
00:53:52,763 --> 00:53:55,731
[Aylin]<i> I didn't have a clue</i>
<i> my mom had a bad heart</i>

872
00:53:56,300 --> 00:53:58,467
<i> or I wouldn't have</i>
<i> taken her to the gym.</i>

873
00:53:59,537 --> 00:54:04,607
<i> She never wanted me to worry</i>
<i> and now my lifeline is gone.</i>

874
00:54:05,710 --> 00:54:08,611
<i> Of course, Bjorn wasn't there</i>
<i> when I needed him most.</i>

875
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:12,548
<i> How can I love a man that</i>
<i> loves the mog more than me?</i>

876
00:54:17,388 --> 00:54:19,655
How much longer until we
reach this little shithole town?

877
00:54:19,657 --> 00:54:21,523
I would like to make
it back to LA tonight.

878
00:54:22,293 --> 00:54:23,492
That long?

879
00:54:26,764 --> 00:54:27,763
[hangs up]

880
00:54:32,703 --> 00:54:34,536
I'm here, I'm here.

881
00:54:36,574 --> 00:54:39,608
-Where is everyone?
-What are you doing here?

882
00:54:40,511 --> 00:54:44,013
What do you mean, what am
I doing here? I am here for
you in your hour of need.

883
00:54:44,015 --> 00:54:45,614
You've gotta be kidding me.

884
00:54:45,616 --> 00:54:49,685
The ceremony is over.
You know what?
Everything is over.

885
00:54:49,687 --> 00:54:52,788
Bjorn, I needed you
one time in my life.

886
00:54:52,790 --> 00:54:57,426
Over, what do you mean over?
I don't understand how can they
start the ceremony without me.

887
00:54:57,428 --> 00:54:58,427
That doesn't make any sense.

888
00:54:58,429 --> 00:55:00,129
I just got here.

889
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:01,830
What? I get it, you need
a shoulder to cry on.

890
00:55:02,466 --> 00:55:04,833
-It's okay.
-Don't touch me, okay?

891
00:55:05,770 --> 00:55:08,637
Go, Bjorn, it's over.

892
00:55:23,387 --> 00:55:26,588
Aylin, if there's anything
you need in the days ahead,

893
00:55:26,590 --> 00:55:29,358
-please don't hesitate
to give us a call, okay?
-Thank you.

894
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:30,426
God bless.

895
00:55:31,629 --> 00:55:34,763
-How are you holding up?
-Not very well.

896
00:55:35,366 --> 00:55:37,333
I think you're holding
up pretty good.

897
00:55:37,668 --> 00:55:43,872
-Sweetie, what are you
gonna do about Bjorn?
-Dump him, please.

898
00:55:45,776 --> 00:55:47,409
It's already done.

899
00:55:47,411 --> 00:55:49,878
He's never gonna love anyone
as much as he loves himself.

900
00:55:50,748 --> 00:55:52,748
Will you guys excuse
me for a minute?

901
00:56:00,858 --> 00:56:01,824
Aylin!

902
00:56:03,461 --> 00:56:05,494
Are you really leaving
without saying goodbye?

903
00:56:07,398 --> 00:56:08,497
I'm sorry, Riley.

904
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:10,699
Can I ask where you're going?

905
00:56:10,701 --> 00:56:16,839
Someplace private.
I need to get away,
grieve on my own terms.

906
00:56:16,841 --> 00:56:18,474
The beach house.

907
00:56:19,844 --> 00:56:21,377
I know because I know you.

908
00:56:22,847 --> 00:56:24,747
Do you know how
long you'll be gone?

909
00:56:26,851 --> 00:56:28,951
I don't know, as long as I need.

910
00:56:30,488 --> 00:56:34,123
The studio won't be
too happy with me, but
it's what I have to do.

911
00:56:34,125 --> 00:56:35,657
You should get going.

912
00:56:35,926 --> 00:56:37,726
Don't worry, I'll cover for you.

913
00:56:38,529 --> 00:56:39,795
Thank you, Riley.

914
00:56:40,631 --> 00:56:41,864
Yeah, don't mention it.

915
00:56:43,934 --> 00:56:45,701
Get out of here,
the clock's ticking.

916
00:56:45,703 --> 00:56:46,935
Go find your love.

917
00:56:50,941 --> 00:56:56,879
[Aylin]<i> I am utterly alone</i>
<i> for the first time in my life.</i>

918
00:56:58,783 --> 00:57:03,485
<i> Time to go back, find myself,</i>
<i> back to the beach house.</i>

919
00:57:03,487 --> 00:57:06,755
<i>But, the house will be so empty.</i>

920
00:57:07,658 --> 00:57:10,993
<i> When I come through that</i>
<i> door, Mom won't be waiting.</i>

921
00:57:28,646 --> 00:57:30,429
Hey there, doctor.

922
00:57:30,430 --> 00:57:32,213
-Janelle, how you doing?
-What are you doing here?

923
00:57:32,216 --> 00:57:34,783
You are the last person
I expected to see tonight.

924
00:57:34,785 --> 00:57:37,719
I don't know, it's
been a rough week.

925
00:57:38,456 --> 00:57:40,522
Thought a few drinks
might do me some good.

926
00:57:41,592 --> 00:57:44,460
I'll have the amber short.

927
00:57:44,462 --> 00:57:48,931
-How about buying
a poor girl a drink?
-Tell them what you want.

928
00:57:48,933 --> 00:57:50,666
I'll have the usual.

929
00:57:56,774 --> 00:57:58,207
Thank you, doctor.

930
00:57:58,209 --> 00:58:00,009
You're welcome.

931
00:58:00,010 --> 00:58:01,810
Say, there is an empty
booth over there.

932
00:58:02,680 --> 00:58:05,047
What do you say we
go get to know each
other a little better?

933
00:58:07,952 --> 00:58:10,752
Yeah, that sounds good.

934
00:58:23,567 --> 00:58:28,904
We never get a chance
to talk at work, so, tell me
a little bit about yourself.

935
00:58:28,906 --> 00:58:33,709
-What would you like to know?
-What's your favorite food?

936
00:58:34,245 --> 00:58:35,711
I don't know.

937
00:58:35,713 --> 00:58:39,681
-What's yours?
-Anything Italian.

938
00:58:39,683 --> 00:58:41,583
-Italian, really?
-Yeah.

939
00:58:41,585 --> 00:58:46,054
Okay. I'd have to go
with Mediterranean.

940
00:58:46,056 --> 00:58:47,556
-Okay.
-Yeah.

941
00:58:47,558 --> 00:58:49,591
Yeah, sounds exotic.

942
00:58:49,593 --> 00:58:50,626
It kind of is.

943
00:58:50,628 --> 00:58:52,311
I've never had it before.

944
00:58:52,312 --> 00:58:53,995
Well, if you ever get the
chance, you should try it.

945
00:58:53,998 --> 00:58:56,598
It is, I don't know, it's good.

946
00:58:56,967 --> 00:58:58,834
My house is only a block away.

947
00:59:03,574 --> 00:59:04,740
Let's do it.

948
00:59:04,742 --> 00:59:06,608
I thought you'd never ask.

949
00:59:11,615 --> 00:59:17,119
So, why don't you hang out
here, and I'm gonna go slip into
something more comfortable.

950
00:59:33,904 --> 00:59:35,737
[glass breaks]

951
00:59:36,941 --> 00:59:38,707
[Janelle] Oh, shit.

952
00:59:50,788 --> 00:59:52,888
-Janelle?
-Yeah, I'm fine.

953
00:59:55,926 --> 00:59:57,593
I said I was fine.

954
00:59:57,595 --> 00:59:59,761
I need to know, did you
take those from the clinic?

955
00:59:59,763 --> 01:00:02,898
No, I would never do that.

956
01:00:02,900 --> 01:00:04,933
Janelle, you need to tell me
where you got the damn pills.

957
01:00:04,935 --> 01:00:06,835
-Jake, they're my pills!
-Did you get them
from the clinic?

958
01:00:06,837 --> 01:00:10,672
I mean, no, I don't mean
they're my pills I mean,
they belong to a friend,

959
01:00:10,674 --> 01:00:13,609
and I took them from her so
that she wouldn't use them.

960
01:00:17,881 --> 01:00:19,648
Let's just forget about it.

961
01:00:20,684 --> 01:00:23,385
Janelle, I think you might
need some help and-

962
01:00:23,387 --> 01:00:26,755
and you may need to go
somewhere they can keep
an eye on you for a while.

963
01:00:27,858 --> 01:00:29,691
I got someone who
can help you, okay?

964
01:00:29,994 --> 01:00:32,160
Jake, no wait,
please don't do this.

965
01:00:32,963 --> 01:00:36,231
Please, just calm down. Let's--
let's make another drink.

966
01:00:38,035 --> 01:00:39,868
Please, they're not mine,
they belong to a friend.

967
01:00:39,870 --> 01:00:42,070
-Let's just-- please--
-Just got to call some-

968
01:00:42,072 --> 01:00:45,841
I'm begging you, okay?
Let's relax, let's get to
know each other, remember?

969
01:00:45,843 --> 01:00:47,009
Janelle.

970
01:00:49,413 --> 01:00:50,946
Jake, don't you dare!

971
01:00:51,181 --> 01:00:54,116
If you do this, I'll
tell them it was you.

972
01:00:54,118 --> 01:00:56,852
If you call whoever
you're gonna call,
I will blame it on you,

973
01:00:56,854 --> 01:00:59,855
I will say that you made me
do it so that my friend
would sleep with you.

974
01:00:59,857 --> 01:01:01,657
You do what you
gotta do, Janelle.

975
01:01:02,026 --> 01:01:03,158
[crying]

976
01:01:04,395 --> 01:01:06,094
Jake, please!

977
01:02:16,066 --> 01:02:18,266
[Aylin]<i> It's hard being</i>
<i> out here without Mom.</i>

978
01:02:18,802 --> 01:02:19,835
<i> It's so lonely.</i>

979
01:02:19,837 --> 01:02:23,939
Oh yeah, I get that. Got
a lot of memories there.

980
01:02:23,941 --> 01:02:26,508
Yeah, some not so good though.

981
01:02:26,510 --> 01:02:31,146
Oh I know, I remember it took
you a full year before you
could go back there after Jake.

982
01:02:31,515 --> 01:02:34,850
I know, it still makes
me a little sad.

983
01:02:35,986 --> 01:02:39,888
Oh. Yes! Riley, I found
the default notice.

984
01:02:39,890 --> 01:02:41,256
I knew it.

985
01:02:42,226 --> 01:02:44,693
Did you hear what I just said?

986
01:02:44,694 --> 01:02:47,161
Oh yeah, of course,
I could see why it could
still make you sad,

987
01:02:47,164 --> 01:02:49,030
<i> especially without your mom.</i>

988
01:02:49,032 --> 01:02:51,767
Nail him, we need our money.

989
01:02:51,769 --> 01:02:56,838
Just go out there, you
know, make some new
friends, have a good time.

990
01:02:57,908 --> 01:03:00,175
I don't know, it's not
as easy as it sounds.

991
01:03:00,177 --> 01:03:04,913
Oh come on, stop wallowing
in self pity, your mom
wouldn't have wanted that.

992
01:03:04,915 --> 01:03:06,915
Go, do something.

993
01:03:08,218 --> 01:03:11,086
Maybe I'll grab a bite
tonight at the Sand Dune.

994
01:03:11,088 --> 01:03:13,922
Wait, the Sand Dune?

995
01:03:14,992 --> 01:03:16,958
Didn't see that one coming.

996
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:19,928
Hey, Riley, Riley, it's Aylin.

997
01:03:19,930 --> 01:03:22,531
She's thinking of going
to the Sand Dune.

998
01:03:22,533 --> 01:03:23,965
[gasps] Put it on
speaker, I want to hear.

999
01:03:24,968 --> 01:03:26,334
Hey, Aylin, it's Riley.

1000
01:03:26,336 --> 01:03:27,869
We know what you're up to.

1001
01:03:27,871 --> 01:03:30,522
What are you talking about?

1002
01:03:30,523 --> 01:03:33,174
After all these years you think
we don't know that you still
carry a torch for that boy?

1003
01:03:33,177 --> 01:03:35,877
I mean, come on, do you
think we're really that stupid?

1004
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:40,315
But I'm not carrying a torch for
Jake anymore, really, I'm not.

1005
01:03:40,317 --> 01:03:42,984
Yeah, okay, whatever you
say, girl, but I have a plan.

1006
01:03:42,986 --> 01:03:46,321
I think you should go down
to the Sand Dune, you need
to find Jake, wherever he is.

1007
01:03:46,323 --> 01:03:48,607
Do some sort of
romantic gesture.

1008
01:03:48,608 --> 01:03:50,892
[Jessi]<i> Riley, will you</i>
<i> take this paperwork to</i>
<i> the attorney's office ASAP?</i>

1009
01:03:50,894 --> 01:03:55,130
All right, bye Aylin,
and remember, go follow
your love. It's the only way.

1010
01:03:56,567 --> 01:03:59,234
-What are you guys doing?
-[Jessi]<i> Nothing, just work.</i>

1011
01:03:59,937 --> 01:04:01,937
You know, I really gotta run.

1012
01:04:01,939 --> 01:04:04,072
Can I call you back later? Bye.

1013
01:04:04,308 --> 01:04:07,275
[Aylin's inner voice]
<i> Jessi's right, life goes on.</i>

1014
01:04:07,845 --> 01:04:09,244
<i> Mom would have</i>
<i> wanted it that way.</i>

1015
01:04:10,013 --> 01:04:12,147
<i> And Riley's a mind-reader.</i>

1016
01:04:12,616 --> 01:04:15,016
<i> I've always wondered</i>
<i> what happened to Jake.</i>

1017
01:04:15,352 --> 01:04:16,885
Thanks.

1018
01:04:22,860 --> 01:04:29,164
<i> A crazy fashion phenomenon</i>
<i> called a mog has taken</i>
<i> American men by storm.</i>

1019
01:04:29,166 --> 01:04:34,336
<i> Small dogs are considered</i>
<i> the hottest new fashion</i>
<i> accessory for men this season.</i>

1020
01:04:34,338 --> 01:04:37,005
<i> Many find this</i>
<i> new trend strange,</i>

1021
01:04:37,007 --> 01:04:39,374
<i> but the movement has</i>
<i> gained sufficient momentum</i>

1022
01:04:39,376 --> 01:04:44,079
<i> since Hollywood star and</i>
<i> ex-Aylin love interest, Bjorn,</i>

1023
01:04:44,081 --> 01:04:46,214
<i> publicly showed off his mog.</i>

1024
01:04:46,216 --> 01:04:48,183
<i> Russ, do you have any</i>
<i> thoughts on this one?</i>

1025
01:04:49,319 --> 01:04:51,186
[Julia]<i> You're so cute, aw.</i>

1026
01:04:51,188 --> 01:04:54,389
[Russ]<i> And now here's Romeo</i>

1027

[whispering]

1028
01:05:20,117 --> 01:05:22,083
-Excuse me, sorry.
-Sorry.

1029
01:05:25,455 --> 01:05:27,455
[Aylin's inner voice]<i> I guess</i>
<i> I should have expected it.</i>

<i> Going out incognito</i>

1031
01:05:31,395 --> 01:05:33,295
<i> I think I'll go for a swim.</i>

1032
01:05:34,264 --> 01:05:36,531
<i> Maybe it will relax me.</i>

1033
01:05:49,413 --> 01:05:53,481
<i> Okay, concentrate</i>
<i> on the beautiful day.</i>

1034
01:05:54,017 --> 01:05:57,218
<i>The water is warm and soothing.</i>

1035
01:05:58,021 --> 01:05:59,387
<i> What could possibly go wrong?</i>

1036
01:06:18,275 --> 01:06:20,108
[breathing heavily]

1037
01:06:35,192 --> 01:06:36,324
Doctor!

1038
01:06:38,462 --> 01:06:40,128
Doctor!

1039
01:06:43,266 --> 01:06:44,499
I can't--

1040
01:06:50,774 --> 01:06:53,274
Uh, shot, epinephrine shot.

1041
01:06:57,114 --> 01:06:59,214
Don't you say a word
about who's in this room.

1042
01:06:59,216 --> 01:07:01,483
The media will be
all over this if you do,
do you understand?

1043
01:07:01,485 --> 01:07:02,884
Yes, doctor.

1044
01:07:02,885 --> 01:07:04,284
All right, I'm gonna
stay in here.

1045
01:07:27,477 --> 01:07:29,077
Oh, God, did I die?

1046
01:07:35,252 --> 01:07:36,317
Jake?

1047
01:07:37,554 --> 01:07:38,586
Hi.

1048
01:07:41,391 --> 01:07:43,058
It's been a while.

1049
01:07:43,060 --> 01:07:44,059
Yeah.

1050
01:07:45,562 --> 01:07:47,128
How are you feeling?

1051
01:07:51,468 --> 01:07:52,901
I think I've been better.

1052
01:07:52,902 --> 01:07:54,335
You had an allergic reaction
to a jellyfish sting.

1053
01:07:55,806 --> 01:07:59,841
Throat nearly swelled shut
but you're fine now. We got
it all fixed up for ya, so.

1054
01:07:59,843 --> 01:08:04,279
Oh, your wig is over there,
we had to put it aside.

1055
01:08:04,281 --> 01:08:06,848
Oh, no, no, no, I can't
be here right now.

1056
01:08:06,850 --> 01:08:08,650
-Calm down.
-I gotta go, I really can't-

1057
01:08:09,252 --> 01:08:11,152
Aylin, hey look, you
need to understand

1058
01:08:11,154 --> 01:08:14,155
your body has just been through
a very traumatic experience.

1059
01:08:14,424 --> 01:08:18,593
It's not safe for you to drive
home right, and I can't let you
drive home right now so just

1060
01:08:19,162 --> 01:08:21,129
do me a favor and wait, okay?

1061
01:08:21,131 --> 01:08:25,117
No, but if the media
sees me here.

1062
01:08:25,118 --> 01:08:29,104
I'm ready to leave, I could--
I could give you a ride home.
I do remember the way, so.

1063
01:08:29,573 --> 01:08:32,307
Okay, but you gotta
go get me my red wig.

1064
01:08:32,309 --> 01:08:34,342
I need to go incognito.

1065
01:08:38,281 --> 01:08:42,350
Red suits you,
but I prefer blonde.

1066
01:08:42,586 --> 01:08:46,321
[Aylin's inner voice]<i> I couldn't</i>
<i> dream in a million years,</i>

1067
01:08:46,323 --> 01:08:52,193
<i> Jake, Dr. Jake,</i>
<i> would be saving my life.</i>

1068
01:08:58,368 --> 01:08:59,400
Here we are.

1069
01:08:59,669 --> 01:09:00,635
Yeah.

1070
01:09:02,439 --> 01:09:03,505
I remember.

1071
01:09:03,507 --> 01:09:08,409
Thanks for doctoring me up
today, and the ride home.

1072
01:09:08,879 --> 01:09:10,178
Yeah.

1073
01:09:10,180 --> 01:09:13,548
It was my pleasure,
I-- [clears his throat]

1074
01:09:14,417 --> 01:09:15,550
I'm just happy you're okay.

1075
01:09:18,622 --> 01:09:22,157
How long you gonna
be in town? I'd--

1076
01:09:24,494 --> 01:09:25,727
I'd like to see you again.

1077
01:09:30,667 --> 01:09:32,200
I'd like that.

1078
01:09:47,651 --> 01:09:49,384
[message alert]

1079
01:10:23,987 --> 01:10:26,354
I saved your note.

1080
01:10:37,234 --> 01:10:38,600
You have to read it out loud.

1081
01:10:39,502 --> 01:10:42,670
-You promise?
-Maybe.

1082
01:10:50,513 --> 01:10:56,284
[Aylin]<i> You need to know</i>
<i> that the moment I met you</i>
<i> I fell deeply in love</i>

1083
01:10:56,286 --> 01:11:01,589
<i> and you know the honest</i>
<i> truth when I say that time</i>
<i> will never be an issue.</i>

1084
01:11:01,591 --> 01:11:03,524
I can't believe you saved this.

1085
01:11:03,526 --> 01:11:09,397
[Aylin's inner voice]
<i>I was crazy for Jake back then.</i>
<i> Things are different now.</i>

1086
01:11:11,001 --> 01:11:14,569
<i> My life is just way</i>
<i> too complicated</i>
<i> to fall for him again.</i>

1087
01:11:19,776 --> 01:11:24,345
So, there I was with this
baby capuchin monkey.

1088
01:11:24,347 --> 01:11:27,615
-Well, it's capushin
monkey, but...
-No, it's capuchin.

1089
01:11:27,617 --> 01:11:28,750
Okay, it's capuchin.

1090
01:11:28,752 --> 01:11:31,319
Okay, you're a doctor
not a zoologist.

1091
01:11:31,321 --> 01:11:34,489
-What happened?
-So, we're running
through the airport

1092
01:11:34,491 --> 01:11:38,793
with this baby capuchin
monkey, TSA was not happy.

1093
01:11:39,429 --> 01:11:42,397
-What'd they do?
-They took Mittens.

1094
01:11:42,732 --> 01:11:45,366
-You named
the monkey Mittens?
-Yeah.

1095
01:11:47,370 --> 01:11:49,704
-It needed a name.
-It's cute I guess.

1096
01:11:50,340 --> 01:11:52,440
I remember when you told
me you were only 16.

1097
01:11:52,442 --> 01:11:54,459
Oh, God.

1098
01:11:54,460 --> 01:11:56,477
-Do you remember that?
-How could I forget that?

1099
01:11:57,047 --> 01:11:58,479
I was petrified.

1100
01:11:58,481 --> 01:12:00,381
I was so sure you
were gonna bolt.

1101
01:12:00,383 --> 01:12:01,449
I almost did.

1102
01:12:03,086 --> 01:12:04,819
I just knew I couldn't leave.

1103
01:12:07,390 --> 01:12:08,923
That's not what happened.

1104
01:12:11,094 --> 01:12:12,327
I know.

1105
01:12:13,697 --> 01:12:14,929
What about now?

1106
01:12:15,665 --> 01:12:16,731
What about now?

1107
01:12:18,435 --> 01:12:19,767
Us, what do you--

1108
01:12:22,539 --> 01:12:23,604
think about us?

1109
01:12:26,676 --> 01:12:27,875
I don't know.

1110
01:12:29,746 --> 01:12:31,679
My life's pretty crazy.

1111
01:12:33,116 --> 01:12:34,949
-Yeah.
-I mean, come on,

1112
01:12:34,950 --> 01:12:36,783
I can't go to the house
without that red wig on.

1113
01:12:36,786 --> 01:12:38,653
Yeah, we could do
it without the wig.

1114
01:12:38,655 --> 01:12:40,421
But I'm serious.

1115
01:12:41,591 --> 01:12:43,758
You remember when
your mom got sunburned?

1116
01:12:46,796 --> 01:12:49,864
Everything about this
place reminds me of her.

1117
01:12:51,468 --> 01:12:53,468
I didn't mean to bring
that up, I'm sorry.

1118
01:12:56,406 --> 01:12:58,906
Wanna get a movie, popcorn?

1119
01:13:00,377 --> 01:13:03,578
Me, you, a TV, couch, popcorn?

1120
01:13:03,580 --> 01:13:05,513
Sounds like my kinda night.

¶¶¶

1122
01:13:19,129 --> 01:13:22,697
Come on, dance with me,
please dance with me, spin.

1123
01:13:33,576 --> 01:13:34,675
Guess who?

1124
01:13:37,447 --> 01:13:38,646
Jesus?

1125
01:13:38,647 --> 01:13:39,846
No, no, no, no.
I love these pants.

1126
01:13:39,849 --> 01:13:42,016
I can't do anything for
you, the water loves you.

1127
01:13:42,952 --> 01:13:45,453
-The water loves you.
-[laughing]

1128
01:13:48,591 --> 01:13:50,591
Now I gotta come in. Whoo!

1129
01:13:53,496 --> 01:13:55,430
[chattering]

1130
01:13:57,500 --> 01:13:59,434
¶¶¶

1131
01:15:55,818 --> 01:15:58,236
[Jake] It's a fashion statement.

1132
01:15:58,237 --> 01:16:00,655
[Aylin] It's not a fashion
statement, I know more
about fashion statements.

1133
01:16:01,090 --> 01:16:03,925
I'm in disguise, just
like you, just shh.

1134
01:16:04,294 --> 01:16:06,594
You know I think you
got a little something.

1135
01:16:06,596 --> 01:16:09,297
-Right here?
-Yeah. Let me just, come here.

1136
01:16:09,299 --> 01:16:10,965
-What are you doing?
-Let me just...

1137
01:16:11,334 --> 01:16:12,133
[grunts]

1138
01:16:12,135 --> 01:16:16,304
-Oops, sorry, did--
did that hurt?
-Yeah.

1139
01:16:16,306 --> 01:16:21,309
You look pretty good
in this, what is this,
an Italian barber mustache?

1140
01:16:21,311 --> 01:16:26,147
Yeah, well, I hope you're happy
because now the paparazzi
are gonna be all over me.

1141
01:16:26,749 --> 01:16:32,086
I was thinking about this, I'm
shooting a feature next month
out in California and I was

1142
01:16:32,889 --> 01:16:34,922
kinda hoping you would
want to come out and visit.

1143
01:16:36,993 --> 01:16:40,361
-I mean-
-California?

1144
01:16:40,362 --> 01:16:43,730
Yeah, couple days
or weeks, I don't know.
But it, just for fun.

1145
01:16:47,937 --> 01:16:50,004
I just, you know I don't
think it's my scene.

1146
01:16:51,708 --> 01:16:54,976
Lived 32 of my life as a
small town country boy, and

1147
01:16:55,612 --> 01:16:59,146
plus I got the clinic and
I employ people there.

1148
01:16:59,849 --> 01:17:01,616
But I'll be here
when you come back.

1149
01:17:05,888 --> 01:17:09,323
No, I understand.

1150
01:17:09,324 --> 01:17:12,759
You know, as beautiful
as you look with that
wig on in all these lights,

1151
01:17:14,797 --> 01:17:16,097
I think we should
get out of here.

1152
01:17:16,099 --> 01:17:19,133
-You wanna go? Yeah?
-I'd like that.

1153
01:17:23,940 --> 01:17:25,640
Put it on my tab, Bill.

1154
01:17:26,009 --> 01:17:27,708
[Bill] Y'all have
a good night, Jake.

1155
01:17:30,813 --> 01:17:36,917
<i>This just in to</i> Catch Our Vibe,

1166

[Aylin's inner voice]
<i> Typical. Just too typical.</i>

1167
01:18:28,738 --> 01:18:29,470
Hey.

1168
01:18:29,472 --> 01:18:30,705
You--

1169
01:18:32,141 --> 01:18:33,107
you leaving?

1170
01:18:36,813 --> 01:18:37,845
Yeah.

1171
01:18:39,215 --> 01:18:42,149
Jake, I gotta go back to work.

1172
01:18:42,785 --> 01:18:48,222
I got contracts, obligations,
I got people who work under me.

1173
01:18:50,793 --> 01:18:51,792
Yeah.

1174
01:18:54,797 --> 01:18:55,830
[sighs]

1175
01:18:57,066 --> 01:18:58,265
So, when are you leaving?

1176
01:18:59,936 --> 01:19:02,103
My flight leaves
tomorrow at six.

1177
01:19:02,939 --> 01:19:04,205
Tomorrow at six.

1178
01:19:06,042 --> 01:19:07,274
Well, that's quick.

1179
01:19:16,519 --> 01:19:17,985
When are you coming back?

1180
01:19:20,957 --> 01:19:23,374
I don't know if I'm coming back.

1181
01:19:23,375 --> 01:19:25,792
All right, what do-- what
do you mean, you don't
know if you're coming back?

1182
01:19:25,795 --> 01:19:26,360
Jake,

1183
01:19:27,830 --> 01:19:29,130
what do you want me to say?

1184
01:19:29,132 --> 01:19:30,798
I want you to say
you're coming back.

1185
01:19:33,102 --> 01:19:34,769
I can't say that.

1186
01:19:37,940 --> 01:19:40,508
I'm not the same girl
you met ten years ago.

1187
01:19:40,510 --> 01:19:43,878
What are you talking about?
What does that mean?

1188
01:19:43,880 --> 01:19:47,148
So, you come back and
spend a couple weeks with
me, and you know everything?

1189
01:19:47,150 --> 01:19:49,150
Everything you
missed in ten years.

1190
01:19:50,953 --> 01:19:51,852
Yeah.

1191
01:19:51,854 --> 01:19:56,390
You know sometimes I think
I know you a little better
than you know yourself.

1192
01:19:57,527 --> 01:19:58,893
You know what I think?

1193
01:20:01,130 --> 01:20:02,263
I think you're scared.

1194
01:20:05,168 --> 01:20:06,200
Scared

1195
01:20:06,202 --> 01:20:10,905
of being vulnerable, needing
somebody, needing me.

1196
01:20:12,208 --> 01:20:13,207
'Cause I,

1197
01:20:15,311 --> 01:20:16,911
I need you.

1198
01:20:16,913 --> 01:20:23,083
I need the fake mustache
and I need the wig, I need
two stepping in the kitchen.

1199
01:20:23,586 --> 01:20:25,419
I need all that
'cause I need you.

1200
01:20:26,122 --> 01:20:28,989
I don't know why we
work together, we just do.

1201
01:20:28,991 --> 01:20:32,960
We're like a two-piece
puzzle, we just, we just fit.

1202
01:20:37,033 --> 01:20:40,367
I mean, you're the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

1203
01:20:45,174 --> 01:20:46,173
Jake,

1204
01:20:47,977 --> 01:20:50,845
ever since I was
16 and I met you,

1205
01:20:53,216 --> 01:20:55,049
you left something in me.

1206
01:20:56,919 --> 01:21:00,855
And my mother's
death, it's been there--

1207
01:21:03,025 --> 01:21:06,393
I've always been yours
and I probably always will.

1208
01:21:07,296 --> 01:21:10,130
Yeah, and I'm here now.

1209
01:21:10,867 --> 01:21:12,132
Nothing's changed.

1210
01:21:14,070 --> 01:21:18,138
I'm right here, I'm not going.
You don't have to go anywhere.

1211
01:21:22,912 --> 01:21:24,945
I never said I didn't need you.

1212
01:21:26,949 --> 01:21:28,082
But right now

1213
01:21:30,286 --> 01:21:31,952
I need you to go.

1214
01:21:35,024 --> 01:21:36,156
Please.

1215
01:21:55,177 --> 01:21:56,210
[sighs]

1216
01:21:58,948 --> 01:22:00,314
I can't lose you again.

1217
01:22:01,951 --> 01:22:03,517
Just go, please.

1218
01:22:04,954 --> 01:22:05,986
Please.

1219
01:22:08,124 --> 01:22:10,424
You know you are--

1220
01:22:15,131 --> 01:22:18,332
breaking my heart. [crying]

1221
01:22:28,277 --> 01:22:29,343
[door closing]

1222
01:22:46,996 --> 01:22:48,329
