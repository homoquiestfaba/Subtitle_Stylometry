1
00:00:24,624 --> 00:00:26,759
<i>Every town has its legends.</i>

2
00:00:26,761 --> 00:00:30,596
<i>Every neighborhood</i>
<i>has its boogeymen...</i>

3
00:00:30,598 --> 00:00:34,099
<i>A killer with a hook</i>
<i>for a hand...</i>

4
00:00:34,101 --> 00:00:37,336
<i>A drifter</i>
<i>who snatches children...</i>

5
00:00:37,338 --> 00:00:40,372
<i>The witch who lives</i>
<i>in the woods.</i>

6
00:00:40,374 --> 00:00:43,475
<i>Ours growing up in</i>
<i>staten island was cropsey,</i>

7
00:00:43,477 --> 00:00:47,079
<i>about an escaped mental patient</i>
<i>who lived in these buildings</i>

8
00:00:47,081 --> 00:00:49,148
<i>who would snatch children</i>
<i>off the street.</i>

9
00:00:51,751 --> 00:00:53,652
<i>This urban legend turned real</i>

10
00:00:53,654 --> 00:00:56,789
<i>when five neighborhood children</i>
<i>went missing.</i>

11
00:00:59,459 --> 00:01:02,227
<i>It was these disappearances</i>
<i>that led us to examine</i>

12
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:05,230
<i>the real crimes behind</i>
<i>the cropsey urban legend.</i>

13
00:01:05,232 --> 00:01:05,230
<i>A grisly discovery</i>

14
00:01:05,232 --> 00:01:09,268
<i>of an arm and a leg</i>
<i>sticking out</i>
<i>from a shallow grave.</i>

15
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:10,702
<i> And what we</i>
<i>discovered was a connection</i>

16
00:01:10,704 --> 00:01:13,739
<i>to an institution</i>
<i>with a shocking history.</i>

17
00:01:13,741 --> 00:01:15,307
<i>This is what it looked like,</i>

18
00:01:15,309 --> 00:01:18,110
<i>but how can I tell you</i>
<i>about the way it smelled.</i>

19
00:01:18,112 --> 00:01:20,579
<i>It smelled of filth,</i>
<i>it smelled of disease,</i>

20
00:01:20,581 --> 00:01:21,847
<i>and it smelled of death.</i>

21
00:01:21,849 --> 00:01:24,416
<i> Understanding</i>
<i>the real story behind cropsey</i>

22
00:01:24,418 --> 00:01:27,486
<i>inspired us to investigate</i>
<i>other urban legends</i>

23
00:01:27,488 --> 00:01:30,789
<i>and the true crimes</i>
<i>that may have influenced them,</i>

24
00:01:30,791 --> 00:01:30,789
<i>and what we uncovered</i>

25
00:01:30,791 --> 00:01:35,461
<i>was a truth more horrific</i>
<i>than any fiction.</i>

26
00:02:34,921 --> 00:02:37,623
This is where
we thought that cropsey lived,

27
00:02:37,625 --> 00:02:40,626
in these buildings here.

28
00:02:40,628 --> 00:02:42,728
It's very easy
for an urban legend

29
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:44,496
to come out of
something like this.

30
00:02:44,498 --> 00:02:46,598
Yeah, and we didn't
think anything of it

31
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:49,902
until kids started going missing
on staten island,

32
00:02:49,904 --> 00:02:53,672
and then we were like,
cropsey is real.

33
00:02:53,674 --> 00:02:55,274
But do you think
every urban legend

34
00:02:55,276 --> 00:02:55,274
has truth behind it?

35
00:02:55,276 --> 00:02:59,244
Yes, I think you have to have
some form of like truth

36
00:02:59,246 --> 00:03:00,879
to gonna go off of.

37
00:03:00,881 --> 00:03:02,447
There's a lot of
other urban legends

38
00:03:02,449 --> 00:03:03,615
in a lot of other communities

39
00:03:03,617 --> 00:03:05,417
that have some form of truth
behind them.

40
00:03:05,419 --> 00:03:05,417
Uh-hm.

41
00:03:05,419 --> 00:03:08,353
And what's interesting
is all these communities

42
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:10,455
have all these places.

43
00:03:10,457 --> 00:03:12,291
<i>Well, every kid is lured to</i>

44
00:03:12,293 --> 00:03:17,496
<i>or fascinated by the old house</i>
<i>at the end of the block.</i>

45
00:03:17,498 --> 00:03:19,231
These are the stories
that fuel your nightmares,

46
00:03:19,233 --> 00:03:21,967
and these are the places
that fuel your nightmares.

47
00:03:21,969 --> 00:03:23,535
<i>So why are you here tonight?</i>

48
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:23,535
You hear stories.

49
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:23,535
We just want to see
what it's about, I guess.

50
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:23,535
<i> What do you guys</i>
<i>expect to find out here?</i>

51
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:29,641
People who died here
are supposed to be the ghosts.

52
00:03:29,643 --> 00:03:29,641
<i> You believe</i>
<i>that there are devil worshipers</i>

53
00:03:29,643 --> 00:03:32,377
<i>in the woods here?</i>
- Oh yeah, I do, I do.

54
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:33,879
Somebody said they were doing
freaky experiments

55
00:03:33,881 --> 00:03:36,415
and crap like that.

56
00:03:36,417 --> 00:03:39,284
<i> Why do we believe</i>
<i>these urban legends?</i>

57
00:03:39,286 --> 00:03:40,919
<i>Maybe we need to believe</i>

58
00:03:40,921 --> 00:03:45,457
<i>because the reality is too much</i>
<i>for some of us to bear.</i>

59
00:03:45,459 --> 00:03:47,659
<i>An old legend that actually</i>
<i>happened this time...</i>

60
00:03:47,661 --> 00:03:49,895
<i>- Many more cases</i>
<i>of contaminated treats...</i>

61
00:03:49,897 --> 00:03:51,863
<i>I know she suffered, a lot.</i>

62
00:03:51,865 --> 00:03:53,332
<i>He pulled a knife</i>

63
00:03:53,334 --> 00:03:55,634
<i>and tied me up</i>
<i>with electrical tape.</i>

64
00:03:55,636 --> 00:03:55,634
Oh, God.

65
00:03:55,636 --> 00:03:59,304
<i> And so instead,</i>
<i>we created our own monsters.</i>

66
00:03:59,306 --> 00:04:00,806
<i> The</i>
<i>36-year-old building contractor</i>

67
00:04:00,808 --> 00:04:02,608
<i>who reportedly dressed</i>
<i>like a clown...</i>

68
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:04,009
<i>At least three young boys</i>

69
00:04:04,011 --> 00:04:05,711
<i>buried under his house.</i>

70
00:04:05,713 --> 00:04:05,711
<i>And maybe that's because</i>

71
00:04:05,713 --> 00:04:10,649
the truth is more terrifying
than we could ever imagine.

72
00:04:10,651 --> 00:04:12,417
<i>- I got seven down</i>
<i>and.</i>

73
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:13,419
<i>Seven down!</i>

74
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:16,989
<i>I've got a child victim...</i>
<i>I need rescue.</i>

75
00:04:18,324 --> 00:04:20,325
<i> For Rachel and me,</i>
<i>this is an attempt</i>

76
00:04:20,327 --> 00:04:23,662
<i>to uncover the source</i>
<i>of our nightmares</i>

77
00:04:23,664 --> 00:04:27,466
<i>as we pull back the curtains</i>
<i>on what it is we all fear...</i>

78
00:04:27,468 --> 00:04:30,969
<i>because urban legends,</i>
<i>as scary as they may be,</i>

79
00:04:30,971 --> 00:04:35,007
<i>are really just warnings for</i>
<i>something much more dangerous...</i>

80
00:04:35,009 --> 00:04:38,443
<i>the reality that may have</i>
<i>started it all.</i>

81
00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:47,452
<i>The hook is one of the oldest</i>

82
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:50,522
<i>and also one of the scariest</i>
<i>urban legends.</i>

83
00:04:50,524 --> 00:04:52,791
<i>A teenage couple</i>
<i>are making out in their car</i>

84
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:54,793
<i>while parked at a lover's Lane.</i>

85
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:56,762
<i>As the two are</i>
<i>about to go all the way,</i>

86
00:04:56,764 --> 00:04:58,330
<i>the radio interrupts them.</i>

87
00:04:58,332 --> 00:04:58,330
...Are killed by an LA gunman...

88
00:04:58,332 --> 00:04:58,330
<i> A crazed maniac</i>
<i>with a hook for a hand</i>

89
00:04:58,332 --> 00:05:03,635
<i>has escaped</i>
<i>from the local insane asylum.</i>

90
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:05,337
<i>The frightened girl</i>
<i>demands to go home</i>

91
00:05:05,339 --> 00:05:08,573
<i>as the frustrated boy</i>
<i>guns the engine.</i>

92
00:05:08,575 --> 00:05:11,643
<i>Later, as the boyfriend</i>
<i>goes to open his date's door,</i>

93
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:13,712
<i>he sees dangling</i>
<i>from the door handle,</i>

94
00:05:13,714 --> 00:05:18,350
<i>the maniac's bloody hook,</i>
<i>ripped from the socket.</i>

95
00:05:18,352 --> 00:05:19,551
The hook urban legend

96
00:05:19,553 --> 00:05:24,089
probably came to be
in the mid-1950s.

97
00:05:24,091 --> 00:05:26,758
<i>One of the interesting</i>
<i>appearances of the hook</i>

98
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,760
<i>was in November 1960</i>

99
00:05:28,762 --> 00:05:31,063
<i>when it actually appeared</i>
<i>in the dear Abby column,</i>

100
00:05:31,065 --> 00:05:34,032
<i>and it's something that a</i>
<i>lot of people would have read.</i>

101
00:05:35,535 --> 00:05:37,102
<i> But dear Abby</i>
<i>wasn't warning teenagers</i>

102
00:05:37,104 --> 00:05:39,905
<i>about escaped madmen</i>
<i>with hooks for hands.</i>

103
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,674
<i>Urban legends</i>
<i>are more mysterious than that</i>

104
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:44,543
<i>and never quite so literal.</i>

105
00:05:44,977 --> 00:05:47,846
<i>Despite its name,</i>
<i>the hook is a cautionary tale</i>

106
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:54,553
<i>warning teenagers everywhere</i>
<i>about the dangers of sex.</i>

107
00:05:54,555 --> 00:05:56,421
<i> The hook</i>
<i>urban legend captured something</i>

108
00:05:56,423 --> 00:05:59,091
in the era that people
were interested in.

109
00:05:59,093 --> 00:06:01,927
<i>It captured a certain amount</i>
<i>of danger being involved</i>

110
00:06:01,929 --> 00:06:07,699
<i>in teenage sexual behavior</i>
<i>and in teenage car culture.</i>

111
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:10,001
<i> For the teenagers</i>
<i>in texarkana, Texas,</i>

112
00:06:10,003 --> 00:06:12,838
<i>this wasn't just</i>
<i>some cautionary tale.</i>

113
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:15,107
<i>In the early spring of 1946,</i>

114
00:06:15,109 --> 00:06:17,075
<i>a masked man</i>
<i>known as the phantom</i>

115
00:06:17,077 --> 00:06:18,510
<i>attacked four couples,</i>

116
00:06:18,512 --> 00:06:21,012
<i>most of whom were parked</i>
<i>on lover's lanes.</i>

117
00:06:21,014 --> 00:06:22,514
<i>The attacks, which killed five,</i>

118
00:06:22,516 --> 00:06:24,649
<i>were said to coincide with</i>
<i>the full moon,</i>

119
00:06:24,651 --> 00:06:27,085
<i>hence the nickname</i>
<i>the moonlight murders.</i>

120
00:06:27,087 --> 00:06:28,653
<i>And although there were</i>
<i>numerous suspects,</i>

121
00:06:28,655 --> 00:06:30,989
<i>the phantom was never caught,</i>

122
00:06:30,991 --> 00:06:34,526
<i>allowing his enduring legacy</i>
<i>to haunt this town</i>

123
00:06:34,528 --> 00:06:36,795
<i>for more than six decades.</i>

124
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:46,471
So this is South robeson
and this old highway 67.

125
00:06:46,473 --> 00:06:49,174
The murder site
is somewhere around here,

126
00:06:49,176 --> 00:06:51,943
but that's what we've got to
kind of figure out.

127
00:06:51,945 --> 00:06:54,413
<i> It was a rainy</i>
<i>Sunday morning on march 24</i>

128
00:06:54,415 --> 00:06:57,416
<i>when a passing motorist noticed</i>
<i>Richard Griffin's oldsmobile</i>

129
00:06:57,418 --> 00:07:01,186
<i>parked on a lover's Lane</i>
<i>off highway 67.</i>

130
00:07:01,188 --> 00:07:03,755
<i>Inside he found Griffin, age 29,</i>

131
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:07,692
<i>and Polly Ann Moore, 17,</i>
<i>lying in the backseat.</i>

132
00:07:07,694 --> 00:07:11,930
<i>Both had been shot</i>
<i>in the back of the head.</i>

133
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:13,465
<i> Hey, guys,</i>
<i>how are you doing?</i>

134
00:07:13,467 --> 00:07:13,465
<i>What we're doing is</i>

135
00:07:13,467 --> 00:07:16,601
<i>we're investigating</i>
<i>the phantom killer.</i>

136
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:19,504
They had a lot of speculations
on who did it,

137
00:07:19,506 --> 00:07:21,440
but it was never...

138
00:07:21,442 --> 00:07:23,041
no one was ever
brought to justice.

139
00:07:23,043 --> 00:07:24,810
Did you hear stories growing up?

140
00:07:24,812 --> 00:07:27,446
All I ever heard was
don't go to spring lake park.

141
00:07:27,448 --> 00:07:27,446
Really?
Uh-hm.

142
00:07:27,448 --> 00:07:30,949
Why?
It's kind of
creepy out there,

143
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:33,118
so we were always afraid
to go there.

144
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,453
<i>But did you still go?</i>

145
00:07:34,455 --> 00:07:34,453
No.

146
00:07:34,455 --> 00:07:34,453
<i>We're having a little trouble</i>

147
00:07:34,455 --> 00:07:34,453
<i>finding out where the area is</i>
<i>because everything's changed.</i>

148
00:07:34,455 --> 00:07:40,559
Well, I can take you
out there to the road

149
00:07:40,561 --> 00:07:43,528
and point to almost the spot.

150
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:44,696
Right about there.

151
00:07:44,698 --> 00:07:45,698
Uh-huh.

152
00:07:45,699 --> 00:07:46,998
<i>On that side?</i>

153
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,834
On that side.

154
00:07:48,836 --> 00:07:50,535
<i> Like the couple</i>
<i>in the urban legend,</i>

155
00:07:50,537 --> 00:07:51,803
<i>Griffin and Moore</i>
<i>had been attacked</i>

156
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:53,572
<i>while parked on lover's Lane,</i>

157
00:07:53,574 --> 00:07:56,675
<i>highlighting the warning</i>
<i>behind this campfire tale,</i>

158
00:07:56,677 --> 00:07:58,977
<i>but what the residents</i>
<i>in texarkana didn't know...</i>

159
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:01,513
<i>because it wasn't reported</i>
<i>in the papers...</i>

160
00:08:01,515 --> 00:08:05,750
<i>were the horrific details</i>
<i>behind this real-life crime.</i>

161
00:08:05,752 --> 00:08:09,688
They had found evidence
of blood and a blanket...

162
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:10,690
Uh-hm.

163
00:08:10,691 --> 00:08:11,857
And they believe
that she was raped

164
00:08:11,859 --> 00:08:13,258
out in front of the car

165
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:17,028
and then put back in the car.

166
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:18,230
<i>The first double murder</i>

167
00:08:18,232 --> 00:08:20,065
<i>didn't cause</i>
<i>a lot of excitement.</i>

168
00:08:20,067 --> 00:08:22,534
All kinds of crimes
were going on in texarkana,

169
00:08:22,536 --> 00:08:26,538
but they didn't recognize
until sometime later

170
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:29,074
that this is a different
kind of crime.

171
00:08:29,076 --> 00:08:32,811
The term "serial killer"
wasn't in vogue then...

172
00:08:32,813 --> 00:08:36,014
And no one recognized
this as a serial killing.

173
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:38,617
<i>The main suspect</i>
<i>was youell swinney</i>

174
00:08:38,619 --> 00:08:40,852
who was an ex-convict.

175
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:42,888
<i> Youell swinney</i>
<i>and his newlywed bride,</i>

176
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:44,756
<i>a former prostitute named Peggy,</i>

177
00:08:44,758 --> 00:08:47,726
<i>had been arrested</i>
<i>for stealing cars.</i>

178
00:08:47,728 --> 00:08:49,094
<i>Under questioning,</i>
<i>the wife confessed</i>

179
00:08:49,096 --> 00:08:51,062
<i>that her husband</i>
<i>was the phantom,</i>

180
00:08:51,064 --> 00:08:53,498
<i>but refused to sign a statement.</i>

181
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,100
<i>Although the case</i>
<i>quickly fell apart,</i>

182
00:08:55,102 --> 00:08:58,003
<i>the judge still sent swinney</i>
<i>away for life</i>

183
00:08:58,005 --> 00:09:00,839
<i>as a habitual car thief.</i>

184
00:09:00,841 --> 00:09:02,908
No evidence directly
correlating...

185
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:05,076
<i>No physical evidence.</i>

186
00:09:05,078 --> 00:09:07,279
They had his wife's statement,

187
00:09:07,281 --> 00:09:09,981
but they could not use that
without her permission.

188
00:09:09,983 --> 00:09:12,617
There had been a lot of
other suspects, hundreds.

189
00:09:12,619 --> 00:09:13,985
People had theories

190
00:09:13,987 --> 00:09:16,755
and all kinds of rumors
had been bouncing around,

191
00:09:16,757 --> 00:09:20,659
but it's normal in any event,
especially when there's mystery

192
00:09:20,661 --> 00:09:23,795
as there was always mystery
in this one.

193
00:09:23,797 --> 00:09:27,599
<i>Texarkana is nothing</i>
<i>like other towns.</i>

194
00:09:27,601 --> 00:09:31,136
It seems to be wallowing
in the notoriety.

195
00:09:31,138 --> 00:09:33,104
Documentary team in town

196
00:09:33,106 --> 00:09:35,240
to shoot a part
of texarkana history.

197
00:09:35,242 --> 00:09:37,108
This week,
some texarkana residents

198
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:38,977
will have the chance
to appear onscreen

199
00:09:38,979 --> 00:09:41,580
<i>in a documentary film</i>
<i>of the phantom killer.</i>

200
00:09:41,582 --> 00:09:43,281
So what should we make
of all this?

201
00:09:43,283 --> 00:09:45,116
The conclusion is simple...

202
00:09:45,118 --> 00:09:47,319
texarkana will never
escape its past.

203
00:09:47,321 --> 00:09:49,087
We should give up trying.

204
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:58,096
<i> It was a half moon</i>
<i>on February 22</i>

205
00:09:58,098 --> 00:10:00,131
<i>when Jimmy Hollis, age 24,</i>

206
00:10:00,133 --> 00:10:02,200
<i>and Mary Jeanne larey, 19,</i>

207
00:10:02,202 --> 00:10:05,103
<i>were attacked</i>
<i>on a secluded</i>
<i>lover's Lane.</i>

208
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:08,974
<i>Both survived after a car</i>
<i>scared the assailant away.</i>

209
00:10:11,877 --> 00:10:13,078
<i>Around midnight,</i>

210
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,980
<i>Mary Jeanne larey</i>
<i>and Jimmy Hollis</i>

211
00:10:14,982 --> 00:10:16,948
<i>were making out</i>
<i>in the front seat of their car.</i>

212
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:20,151
All of a sudden,
a guy appears with a gun,

213
00:10:20,153 --> 00:10:22,621
wearing a mask over his head,
white,

214
00:10:22,623 --> 00:10:25,357
two holes cut out
for eyes and mouth.

215
00:10:25,359 --> 00:10:27,058
He tells her to run.

216
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:31,730
He chases her down
and then starts to attack her,

217
00:10:31,732 --> 00:10:34,666
basically sexually assaults her
with the barrel of his gun.

218
00:10:34,668 --> 00:10:37,168
She said she'd much rather
have been killed like the others

219
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:40,138
than to have been left
the way she was.

220
00:10:41,674 --> 00:10:43,875
<i> While the attacks</i>
<i>on lover's lanes in texarkana</i>

221
00:10:43,877 --> 00:10:46,111
<i>didn't specifically</i>
<i>involve a hook,</i>

222
00:10:46,113 --> 00:10:48,013
<i>the phantom's sickening crimes</i>

223
00:10:48,015 --> 00:10:52,183
<i>created an equally horrifying</i>
<i>metaphor.</i>

224
00:10:52,185 --> 00:10:54,419
<i> One of the victims</i>
<i>was actually sexually assaulted</i>

225
00:10:54,421 --> 00:10:56,154
<i>with the barrel of a gun,</i>

226
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:59,724
and so we have the idea
of a foreign metal object

227
00:10:59,726 --> 00:11:01,926
being used in this way
which seems to be

228
00:11:01,928 --> 00:11:04,963
psychologically
behind the idea of the hook.

229
00:11:04,965 --> 00:11:07,732
<i>In the hook story,</i>
<i>we have the hook</i>

230
00:11:07,734 --> 00:11:11,302
<i>about to penetrate the car</i>
<i>when the boy drives away</i>

231
00:11:11,304 --> 00:11:14,139
<i>and the hook is then ripped</i>
<i>from the hand of the murderer.</i>

232
00:11:14,141 --> 00:11:16,941
<i>So we have the idea</i>
<i>of penetration</i>

233
00:11:16,943 --> 00:11:20,111
with a foreign metal object
as already part of that story,

234
00:11:20,113 --> 00:11:24,416
and that in fact happened
in the texarkana cases.

235
00:11:24,418 --> 00:11:26,818
<i> But the sexual assault</i>
<i>was only part</i>

236
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:29,854
<i>of the phantom's</i>
<i>trademark signature.</i>

237
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:30,989
These two people
are the only ones

238
00:11:30,991 --> 00:11:34,159
who ever saw the phantom.

239
00:11:34,161 --> 00:11:35,527
Both... wearing masks.

240
00:11:35,529 --> 00:11:38,296
<i> Right, they both said</i>
<i>the guy was wearing a mask.</i>

241
00:11:38,298 --> 00:11:38,296
So this is the whole thing,

242
00:11:38,298 --> 00:11:41,933
where the whole white
mask thing came from.

243
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:46,004
<i>The phantom's disguise</i>
<i>was another chilling detail</i>

244
00:11:46,006 --> 00:11:47,305
<i>as it also helped to popularize</i>

245
00:11:47,307 --> 00:11:49,974
<i>the most widely known</i>
<i>retelling of the murders</i>

246
00:11:49,976 --> 00:11:55,413
<i>in the 1976 cult classic,</i>
"the town that dreaded sundown."

247
00:11:55,415 --> 00:11:57,982
<i>The movie was thought to be</i>
<i>one of the first slasher films,</i>

248
00:11:57,984 --> 00:12:00,418
<i>having predated Halloween</i>
<i>by two years,</i>

249
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:02,120
<i>and its take on the phantom</i>

250
00:12:02,122 --> 00:12:06,424
<i>would influence generations</i>
<i>of cinematic boogeymen.</i>

251
00:12:06,426 --> 00:12:08,426
<i>The director,</i>
<i>Charles b. Pierce,</i>

252
00:12:08,428 --> 00:12:10,862
<i>blurred the lines</i>
<i>between fact and fiction</i>

253
00:12:10,864 --> 00:12:14,733
<i>by telling the film</i>
<i>in full documentary style.</i>

254
00:12:14,735 --> 00:12:19,070
<i>It was Sunday, march 3, 1946...</i>

255
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:20,872
<i>the beginning of</i>
<i>a reign of terror</i>

256
00:12:20,874 --> 00:12:25,110
<i>for the people of texarkana,</i>
<i>a terror so indelibly imprinted</i>

257
00:12:25,112 --> 00:12:29,380
<i>that today, people</i>
<i>still speak of it fearfully...</i>

258
00:12:29,382 --> 00:12:33,084
<i>only the names</i>
<i>have been changed.</i>

259
00:12:35,387 --> 00:12:37,055
<i> Now I think</i>
<i>everybody in texarkana</i>

260
00:12:37,057 --> 00:12:39,357
<i>knows about the story</i>
<i>of the phantom killer,</i>

261
00:12:39,359 --> 00:12:41,059
<i>but there's a lot of</i>
<i>intermingling</i>

262
00:12:41,061 --> 00:12:44,162
<i>of facts and legend</i>
<i>between the movie</i>

263
00:12:44,164 --> 00:12:46,765
<i>and the actual</i>
<i>phantom killer case.</i>

264
00:12:46,767 --> 00:12:48,199
<i>This is Casey Roberts,</i>

265
00:12:48,201 --> 00:12:51,202
<i>media manager</i>
<i>at Texas a&m, texarkana.</i>

266
00:12:51,204 --> 00:12:53,238
<i>He's done extensive research</i>
<i>on the crimes</i>

267
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,507
<i>and brought us</i>
<i>to one of the locations where</i>

268
00:12:55,509 --> 00:12:57,909
"the town that dreaded sundown"
<i>was filmed.</i>

269
00:12:57,911 --> 00:12:59,778
A lot the... kind of landmarks

270
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:02,247
from both the original case
of the phantom killer

271
00:13:02,249 --> 00:13:03,982
and the movie
<i>the town that dreaded sundown</i>

272
00:13:03,984 --> 00:13:05,316
have gone away over the years,

273
00:13:05,318 --> 00:13:06,885
and this particular house here

274
00:13:06,887 --> 00:13:10,221
<i>was used in one of</i>
<i>the big scenes.</i>

275
00:13:10,223 --> 00:13:10,221
<i>It was Friday, may 3,</i>

276
00:13:10,223 --> 00:13:14,559
<i>when Virgil and Katie starks</i>
<i>were attacked in</i>
<i>their farmhouse</i>

277
00:13:14,561 --> 00:13:16,795
<i>just outside of town.</i>

278
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:20,131
<i>Virgil was shot</i>
<i>and killed in his armchair...</i>

279
00:13:22,402 --> 00:13:25,170
<i>While Katie, shot in the face,</i>

280
00:13:25,172 --> 00:13:26,905
<i>ran out of the house.</i>

281
00:13:28,774 --> 00:13:31,109
<i>Everybody seems convinced</i>
<i>that youell swinney is the guy,</i>

282
00:13:31,111 --> 00:13:32,811
but you're saying...

283
00:13:32,813 --> 00:13:35,446
Youell swinney would have
been easy to pin it on,

284
00:13:35,448 --> 00:13:37,849
<i>and they needed to</i>
<i>pin it on somebody.</i>

285
00:13:37,851 --> 00:13:39,551
The one person that...

286
00:13:39,553 --> 00:13:42,554
I haven't been satisfied
he was cleared...

287
00:13:42,556 --> 00:13:44,856
<i>was a young man</i>
<i>that committed suicide</i>

288
00:13:44,858 --> 00:13:48,293
<i>and left a note saying</i>
<i>that he was the phantom killer.</i>

289
00:13:48,295 --> 00:13:51,329
<i>It's just part of the legend...</i>
<i>the son of a prominent family,</i>

290
00:13:51,331 --> 00:13:53,832
and it had the connections to,
you know,

291
00:13:53,834 --> 00:13:56,367
cover up his dirty deed.

292
00:13:57,536 --> 00:13:59,370
<i> Hoping to dig up</i>
<i>more information,</i>

293
00:13:59,372 --> 00:14:01,472
<i>we went searching</i>
<i>through the microfiche</i>

294
00:14:01,474 --> 00:14:03,474
<i>of the texarkana gazette.</i>

295
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:06,444
<i>Promising lead proves dud.</i>

296
00:14:06,446 --> 00:14:09,214
So this is the mention
of that, youell swinney.

297
00:14:09,216 --> 00:14:10,949
The officer had been
trying to validate

298
00:14:10,951 --> 00:14:12,317
the story of a woman.

299
00:14:12,319 --> 00:14:14,185
<i>The woman's statement</i>
<i>followed so closely</i>

300
00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:14,185
<i>to the known facts of the case</i>

301
00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:18,156
<i>that they are almost positive</i>
<i>that she was telling the truth,</i>

302
00:14:18,158 --> 00:14:20,024
and at one point,
they were almost to the point

303
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:21,826
of announcing a break
in the case.

304
00:14:21,828 --> 00:14:23,428
Subsequently, however,
the woman said

305
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:25,096
<i>that neither she nor her husband</i>

306
00:14:25,098 --> 00:14:30,134
had anything to do
with the slayings.

307
00:14:30,136 --> 00:14:30,134
<i>It's interesting.</i>

308
00:14:30,136 --> 00:14:33,171
So they don't call him
the phantom at all in this,

309
00:14:33,173 --> 00:14:38,009
but we just saw, literally,

310
00:14:38,011 --> 00:14:40,011
the advertisement
in the newspaper

311
00:14:40,013 --> 00:14:43,147
for the movie that is showing,
<i>the phantom speaks.</i>

312
00:14:43,149 --> 00:14:46,050
This is the movie
that they theoretically

313
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:47,452
pulled the name from,

314
00:14:47,454 --> 00:14:49,454
<i>and right here at the newspaper,</i>

315
00:14:49,456 --> 00:14:49,454
<i>one of the guys said,</i>

316
00:14:49,456 --> 00:14:49,454
'well, why don't we call him
something...'

317
00:14:49,456 --> 00:14:54,893
we need to call him something,
let's call him the phantom.

318
00:14:56,128 --> 00:14:58,229
<i>We had just witnessed</i>
<i>an important step</i>

319
00:14:58,231 --> 00:15:00,365
<i>in the creation</i>
<i>of any urban legend...</i>

320
00:15:00,367 --> 00:15:02,667
<i>the naming of the boogeyman.</i>

321
00:15:04,036 --> 00:15:06,471
<i> One of the roles</i>
<i>that urban legends play...</i>

322
00:15:06,473 --> 00:15:08,940
<i>and this is</i>
<i>an ancient function...</i>

323
00:15:08,942 --> 00:15:12,176
is that they will put
a name on something

324
00:15:12,178 --> 00:15:15,880
that gives people
fears or anxieties.

325
00:15:15,882 --> 00:15:21,052
<i>That gives the person</i>
<i>some feeling of control.</i>

326
00:15:21,054 --> 00:15:25,323
So give the murderer a name...
he's the phantom murderer.

327
00:15:25,325 --> 00:15:29,294
<i> The mask,</i>
<i>the movie, the phantom.</i>

328
00:15:29,296 --> 00:15:31,529
<i>These were the crucial elements</i>
<i>that would help create</i>

329
00:15:31,531 --> 00:15:34,599
<i>texarkana's very own</i>
<i>urban legend...</i>

330
00:15:34,601 --> 00:15:37,035
<i>a legend that would only</i>
<i>continue to grow</i>

331
00:15:37,037 --> 00:15:39,470
<i>with screenings of</i>
"the town that dreaded sundown"

332
00:15:39,472 --> 00:15:43,641
<i>held every year in</i>
<i>texarkana's spring lake park.</i>

333
00:15:43,643 --> 00:15:46,611
All of this area was part
of spring lake park...

334
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:48,212
At the time and this is where...

335
00:15:48,214 --> 00:15:50,381
a couple of the places
where the murders happened.

336
00:15:50,383 --> 00:15:53,284
<i>That was where lover's Lane was.</i>

337
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:55,453
You basically
set up the screening

338
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:58,556
that you have of
<i>the town that dreaded sundown</i>

339
00:15:58,558 --> 00:16:01,092
at spring lake park.

340
00:16:01,094 --> 00:16:03,962
Yes, we do it every October,
and because of the history,

341
00:16:03,964 --> 00:16:07,498
we like the idea of having this
out at spring lake park

342
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:10,268
since that's where some of
the murders take place at.

343
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:11,669
We started getting
some phone calls saying

344
00:16:11,671 --> 00:16:13,338
that they didn't think
it was right,

345
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:15,573
that there were
still families in town...

346
00:16:15,575 --> 00:16:19,377
That, you know,
that were affected by this.

347
00:16:19,379 --> 00:16:19,377
<i>The police concern was</i>

348
00:16:19,379 --> 00:16:23,047
that it was going to
cause somebody else

349
00:16:23,049 --> 00:16:26,217
to have the idea
to start doing it again.

350
00:16:26,219 --> 00:16:28,519
A film crew was in town
last month...

351
00:16:28,521 --> 00:16:30,588
And there's a new movie
being made?

352
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:33,291
What we've heard is
that it was actually a remake

353
00:16:33,293 --> 00:16:33,291
of<i> 'the town</i>
<i>that dreaded sundowns</i> .'

354
00:16:33,293 --> 00:16:40,031
it's you know, just probably
a more modern version of it.

355
00:16:40,033 --> 00:16:43,167
I've heard that the storyline
of the movie

356
00:16:43,169 --> 00:16:46,971
is about a copycat
that comes out

357
00:16:46,973 --> 00:16:52,076
from the screenings
that happened at spring lake.

358
00:16:53,212 --> 00:16:55,146
Are you serious?

359
00:16:55,148 --> 00:16:57,615
That's the first
I've heard about that.

360
00:16:57,617 --> 00:17:01,753
Well, you know,
imitation of life, I guess.

361
00:17:01,755 --> 00:17:04,088
<i> While it may seem</i>
<i>shocking to some,</i>

362
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:06,124
<i>the screenings</i>
<i>at spring lake park</i>

363
00:17:06,126 --> 00:17:09,427
<i>were especially appropriate</i>
<i>because it was here on April 14</i>

364
00:17:09,429 --> 00:17:13,731
<i>where the phantom</i>
<i>turned larger than life.</i>

365
00:17:13,733 --> 00:17:13,731
Four hundred yards

366
00:17:13,733 --> 00:17:16,234
from the entrance
to spring lake park...

367
00:17:16,236 --> 00:17:16,234
where the sign is...

368
00:17:16,236 --> 00:17:20,405
they found
Paul Martin's car empty.

369
00:17:20,407 --> 00:17:20,405
<i>In yet another attack,</i>

370
00:17:20,407 --> 00:17:24,008
<i>not only had the phantom</i>
<i>murdered two teenagers</i>

371
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:25,576
<i>in the center of town,</i>

372
00:17:25,578 --> 00:17:27,478
<i>but their deaths</i>
<i>would incite a panic</i>

373
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:31,482
<i>that would grip texarkana</i>
<i>and never let go.</i>

374
00:17:31,484 --> 00:17:33,451
<i>Betty Jo booker, age 15,</i>

375
00:17:33,453 --> 00:17:35,453
<i>was a saxophonist</i>
<i>for a high school band</i>

376
00:17:35,455 --> 00:17:37,121
<i>called the rhythmaires</i>

377
00:17:37,123 --> 00:17:40,591
<i>that played weekend shows</i>
<i>at the local vfw.</i>

378
00:17:40,593 --> 00:17:43,094
<i>At 1:30 A.M.</i>
<i>that Saturday night,</i>

379
00:17:43,096 --> 00:17:47,098
<i>she left with a</i>
<i>childhood friend</i>
<i>named Paul Martin, age 16,</i>

380
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:50,234
<i>who was supposed to drop</i>
<i>her off at a slumber party.</i>

381
00:17:52,337 --> 00:17:55,306
<i> Paul's body was found</i>
<i>lying on its left side.</i>

382
00:17:55,308 --> 00:17:55,306
<i>Blood was found further down</i>

383
00:17:55,308 --> 00:17:59,143
<i>on the other side of the road</i>
<i>by a fence.</i>

384
00:18:04,516 --> 00:18:08,186
Right over here,
Paul Martin's body was found.

385
00:18:08,188 --> 00:18:08,186
<i>He had been shot twice,</i>

386
00:18:08,188 --> 00:18:13,658
and then he crawled
across the street, over to here,

387
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:16,661
and then whoever did it
shot him again twice.

388
00:18:16,663 --> 00:18:18,463
They said he put up a struggle.

389
00:18:18,465 --> 00:18:20,598
He had a bullet
through his hand...

390
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,600
Right.

391
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:21,599
Raised his hand,

392
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:26,370
probably begged
not to be killed, and then...

393
00:18:26,372 --> 00:18:28,639
<i>They found him</i>
<i>at 6:30 in the morning.</i>

394
00:18:28,641 --> 00:18:32,110
<i>Betty Jo booker</i>
<i>was nowhere around.</i>

395
00:18:32,112 --> 00:18:33,144
<i>Although supposedly</i>

396
00:18:33,146 --> 00:18:33,144
<i>only the names had been changed</i>

397
00:18:33,146 --> 00:18:35,746
in<i> the town</i>
<i>that dreaded sundown,</i>

398
00:18:35,748 --> 00:18:37,682
<i>one of the most egregious</i>
<i>fictionalizations</i>

399
00:18:37,684 --> 00:18:40,251
<i>had Betty Jo booker</i>
<i>playing the trombone</i>

400
00:18:40,253 --> 00:18:42,086
<i>instead of the saxophone,</i>

401
00:18:42,088 --> 00:18:45,289
<i>the reason being to show</i>
<i>a more terrifying demise.</i>

402
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:45,289
<i>The scene was so memorable,</i>

403
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:50,628
<i>some people in town actually</i>
<i>think that's how she died.</i>

404
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,640
<i>The actual site</i>

405
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:04,909
<i>of where Betty Jo booker's</i>
<i>body was found,</i>

406
00:19:04,911 --> 00:19:07,311
<i>along the edge</i>
<i>of a forgotten road,</i>

407
00:19:07,313 --> 00:19:09,147
<i>had eluded many.</i>

408
00:19:09,149 --> 00:19:10,681
<i>Lost in time</i>
<i>when a section of the park</i>

409
00:19:10,683 --> 00:19:12,350
<i>was turned into housing,</i>

410
00:19:12,352 --> 00:19:15,586
<i>this was one mystery</i>
<i>we were determined to solve.</i>

411
00:19:15,588 --> 00:19:17,922
<i>She was found two Miles away</i>

412
00:19:17,924 --> 00:19:20,124
<i>from Martin's body.</i>

413
00:19:20,126 --> 00:19:21,259
<i>The road's closed.</i>

414
00:19:22,694 --> 00:19:26,264
<i>Here's where we think</i>
<i>this road continues on.</i>

415
00:19:26,266 --> 00:19:28,466
<i>See that line</i>
<i>between those two trees?</i>

416
00:19:28,468 --> 00:19:29,667
Totally.

417
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:33,237
<i>That's the road</i>
<i>that's been overgrown.</i>

418
00:19:33,239 --> 00:19:34,605
Keep that flashlight down.

419
00:19:34,607 --> 00:19:35,907
Just turn it down.

420
00:19:38,912 --> 00:19:39,912
Look at that.

421
00:19:39,913 --> 00:19:42,647
<i>This looked exactly like</i>
<i>the older road.</i>

422
00:19:42,649 --> 00:19:44,448
<i>It is the old road basically</i>

423
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:46,817
<i>that we just went through</i>
<i>somebody's backyard to get to.</i>

424
00:19:54,594 --> 00:19:55,560
<i>What is it?</i>

425
00:19:55,562 --> 00:19:56,842
<i>It's a big spider web...</i>

426
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:02,967
<i>It's halfway between</i>
<i>the two ends.</i>

427
00:20:02,969 --> 00:20:06,737
<i>This is Betty Jo booker,</i>
<i>15 years old.</i>

428
00:20:06,739 --> 00:20:08,906
<i> Shot twice,</i>
<i>once to the left rib</i>

429
00:20:08,908 --> 00:20:11,542
<i>and once in the face,</i>
<i>to the left cheek.</i>

430
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:13,211
<i> Well, she's fully</i>
<i>clothed...</i>

431
00:20:13,213 --> 00:20:15,346
<i>Fully clothed, yeah.</i>

432
00:20:15,348 --> 00:20:17,548
<i> Her overcoat</i>
<i>has been buttoned up,</i>

433
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:19,917
<i>and her hand</i>
<i>was put in her pocket.</i>

434
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:25,489
<i>Strange.</i>

435
00:20:25,491 --> 00:20:27,291
<i>See that picture for a second?</i>

436
00:20:35,834 --> 00:20:36,834
<i>Doesn't it look like it?</i>

437
00:20:36,836 --> 00:20:38,669
It must.

438
00:20:38,671 --> 00:20:40,938
<i> Like if you're</i>
<i>looking at it like that,</i>

439
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:42,473
<i>add 60 years.</i>

440
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:47,545
<i> It could be.</i>

441
00:20:47,782 --> 00:20:48,981
<i>I feel bad, though.</i>

442
00:20:48,982 --> 00:20:54,719
You know, we're never going to
really know who killed her.

443
00:21:03,629 --> 00:21:05,696
<i> What happened to</i>
<i>Paul Martin and Betty Jo booker</i>

444
00:21:05,698 --> 00:21:08,032
<i>out on these roads</i>
<i>over 60 years ago</i>

445
00:21:08,034 --> 00:21:09,667
<i>was horrific enough.</i>

446
00:21:09,669 --> 00:21:11,636
<i>Their deaths</i>
<i>didn't need to be rewritten</i>

447
00:21:11,638 --> 00:21:14,505
<i>for more blood or Gore.</i>

448
00:21:14,507 --> 00:21:17,842
<i>Coming out here, you realize</i>
<i>that real life is just as scary</i>

449
00:21:17,844 --> 00:21:22,380
<i>as any horror film...</i>
<i>and sometimes even more.</i>

450
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:30,888
<i>This is Marc bledsoe,</i>
<i>a former probation officer</i>

451
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:32,490
<i>who was obsessed with the case</i>

452
00:21:32,492 --> 00:21:33,991
<i>and conducted his own</i>
<i>investigation.</i>

453
00:21:33,993 --> 00:21:37,028
I developed a passion,
I guess in the '90s.

454
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:40,898
I saw the film, of course,
when I was a seventh grader,

455
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,366
and I was pretty scared

456
00:21:42,368 --> 00:21:44,335
because of the way
the film ends.

457
00:21:44,337 --> 00:21:44,335
It shows the boots

458
00:21:44,337 --> 00:21:46,837
and said he could still
be walking the town.

459
00:21:46,839 --> 00:21:48,773
<i>I wanted to know</i>
<i>what the truth was.</i>

460
00:21:50,542 --> 00:21:52,343
<i> Bledsoe was one of</i>
<i>the only people</i>

461
00:21:52,345 --> 00:21:55,813
<i>to interview youell swinney</i>
<i>in recent years.</i>

462
00:21:55,815 --> 00:21:57,615
<i>Swinney, who was out of jail</i>

463
00:21:57,617 --> 00:21:59,350
<i>and living in</i>
<i>a Texas nursing home,</i>

464
00:21:59,352 --> 00:22:01,585
<i>had suffered a stroke</i>
<i>the year before,</i>

465
00:22:01,587 --> 00:22:03,888
<i>making his speech</i>
<i>difficult to decipher.</i>

466
00:22:11,596 --> 00:22:13,030
Fifty... sixty years?

467
00:22:15,967 --> 00:22:18,502
<i>But she said you and her</i>
<i>were together</i>

468
00:22:18,504 --> 00:22:19,737
<i>at spring lake park.</i>

469
00:22:19,739 --> 00:22:20,739
Hear that?

470
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:24,141
They drove out there together
at spring lake.
What did he say?

471
00:22:31,917 --> 00:22:33,451
<i>No, I wasn't.</i>

472
00:22:33,453 --> 00:22:34,952
<i> Who do you think</i>
<i>was the main...</i>

473
00:22:34,954 --> 00:22:36,987
I don't know.

474
00:22:39,791 --> 00:22:41,092
<i>You wish they'd catch him.</i>

475
00:22:41,094 --> 00:22:42,793
<i>Hm, interesting.</i>

476
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:57,508
<i>Hi. I just wanted</i>
<i>to check one thing.</i>

477
00:22:57,510 --> 00:22:59,377
<i>They told me</i>
<i>you all were videotaping?</i>

478
00:22:59,379 --> 00:23:01,445
<i>Have you all signed the thing?</i>

479
00:23:01,447 --> 00:23:02,480
<i>Ugh!</i>

480
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:05,983
I feel like
there was more there.

481
00:23:10,356 --> 00:23:11,922
<i>Despite being so close,</i>

482
00:23:11,924 --> 00:23:13,657
<i>we still didn't have</i>
<i>an answer as to who</i>

483
00:23:13,659 --> 00:23:17,628
<i>the phantom really was...</i>
<i>and we probably never will.</i>

484
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:19,497
<i> What happened</i>
<i>to the phantom killer</i>

485
00:23:19,499 --> 00:23:21,799
<i>no one really knows.</i>

486
00:23:21,801 --> 00:23:24,769
<i>Some believe he was convicted</i>
<i>of another crime,</i>

487
00:23:24,771 --> 00:23:29,073
<i>and today he is still serving</i>
<i>his term in a Kansas prison.</i>

488
00:23:29,075 --> 00:23:30,808
<i>It's these lack of answers</i>

489
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:32,810
<i>that allows a legend to endure</i>

490
00:23:32,812 --> 00:23:35,579
<i>for the teenagers in texarkana.</i>

491
00:23:35,581 --> 00:23:36,914
<i>So, what do you think</i>
<i>the next chapter is</i>

492
00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:37,916
<i>in that legend?</i>

493
00:23:37,917 --> 00:23:40,384
Probably more ghost stories,

494
00:23:40,386 --> 00:23:45,656
maybe more kids
trying to scare other kids.

495
00:23:45,658 --> 00:23:48,025
Do you think it will ever end?

496
00:23:48,027 --> 00:23:50,027
I think eventually
it will fade out,

497
00:23:50,029 --> 00:23:52,530
but I wouldn't be able to say
for how long.

498
00:23:52,532 --> 00:23:55,399
I mean, legends
last for a long time.

499
00:23:55,401 --> 00:23:56,400
<i>So this is the tree where,</i>

500
00:23:56,402 --> 00:23:58,502
<i>because of the movies,</i>
<i>some people think</i>

501
00:23:58,504 --> 00:24:02,440
<i>Betty Jo booker was actually</i>
<i>killed with the trombone.</i>

502
00:24:02,442 --> 00:24:05,109
<i>I think why this is so</i>
<i>kind of important</i>

503
00:24:05,111 --> 00:24:09,647
<i>is because so many people</i>
<i>believed the fiction,</i>

504
00:24:09,649 --> 00:24:11,048
<i>and the fiction became reality,</i>

505
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:11,949
<i>and in this town...</i>

506
00:24:11,951 --> 00:24:14,151
I really think
what's interesting is...

507
00:24:14,153 --> 00:24:15,619
they can't separate the two.

508
00:24:15,621 --> 00:24:17,521
Well, I think it's more
romantic, though,

509
00:24:17,523 --> 00:24:17,521
to believe in the myth

510
00:24:17,523 --> 00:24:21,192
than to have the facts
in front of you.

511
00:24:21,194 --> 00:24:22,693
<i> You have the</i>
<i>whole town coming out</i>

512
00:24:22,695 --> 00:24:26,664
<i>and watching a fictionalized</i>
<i>version of that,</i>

513
00:24:26,666 --> 00:24:28,732
<i>and that's just like little kids</i>

514
00:24:28,734 --> 00:24:32,636
<i>telling a fictionalized version</i>
<i>of what really happened.</i>

515
00:24:32,638 --> 00:24:34,905
<i>That's what an urban legend is.</i>

516
00:24:34,907 --> 00:24:37,641
<i>Where does the truth end</i>
<i>and the fiction begin?</i>

517
00:24:37,643 --> 00:24:40,211
<i>At this point,</i>
<i>no one quite knows.</i>

518
00:24:40,213 --> 00:24:43,581
<i> Texarkana today still</i>
<i>looks pretty much the same,</i>

519
00:24:43,583 --> 00:24:45,783
<i>and if you should ask people</i>
<i>here on the streets</i>

520
00:24:45,785 --> 00:24:49,186
<i>what they believe happened</i>
<i>to the phantom killer,</i>

521
00:24:49,188 --> 00:24:51,989
<i>most would say</i>
<i>that he is still living here</i>

522
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:55,593
<i>and is walking free.</i>

523
00:25:14,546 --> 00:25:15,980
So right now,
we're driving into Houston.

524
00:25:15,982 --> 00:25:18,249
We're going to investigate
the urban legend

525
00:25:18,251 --> 00:25:20,050
of the candy man.

526
00:25:20,052 --> 00:25:21,585
<i>The name candy man</i>

527
00:25:21,587 --> 00:25:23,854
<i>has a lot of</i>
<i>urban legend references.</i>

528
00:25:23,856 --> 00:25:26,924
<i>Obviously, one of the most</i>
<i>well-known is the film Candyman</i>

529
00:25:26,926 --> 00:25:29,059
<i>based on the clive barker</i>
<i>short story</i>

530
00:25:29,061 --> 00:25:32,229
<i>about an urban legend expert</i>
<i>investigating the boogeyman</i>

531
00:25:32,231 --> 00:25:36,867
<i>who haunts the cabrini-green</i>
<i>housing projects in Chicago.</i>

532
00:25:36,869 --> 00:25:39,703
<i>With my hook for a hand,</i>

533
00:25:39,705 --> 00:25:44,542
<i>I'll split you from your groin</i>
<i>to your gullet.</i>

534
00:25:46,612 --> 00:25:48,112
<i> Here the Candyman</i>
<i>uses a hook,</i>

535
00:25:48,114 --> 00:25:50,214
<i>just like the well-known</i>
<i>hook urban legend</i>

536
00:25:50,216 --> 00:25:52,616
<i>where it was probably</i>
<i>appropriated from,</i>

537
00:25:52,618 --> 00:25:54,952
<i>but the film's villain</i>
<i>wasn't the first candy man.</i>

538
00:25:54,954 --> 00:25:54,952
<i>The original was, in fact,</i>

539
00:25:54,954 --> 00:25:59,723
<i>a very real monster behind</i>
<i>one of the most horrific crimes</i>

540
00:25:59,725 --> 00:26:01,926
<i>anyone could ever imagine.</i>

541
00:26:03,828 --> 00:26:06,630
<i> We've all heard the</i>
<i>same story about Halloween.</i>

542
00:26:06,632 --> 00:26:09,133
<i>Little Johnny had been warned</i>
<i>never to go trick-or-treating</i>

543
00:26:09,135 --> 00:26:12,836
<i>at any house he didn't know,</i>
<i>but he didn't listen.</i>

544
00:26:12,838 --> 00:26:14,672
<i>Instead, he convinces</i>
<i>his friends</i>

545
00:26:14,674 --> 00:26:17,608
<i>to go get candy</i>
<i>from this one weird house.</i>

546
00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:18,642
<i>Later that night,</i>

547
00:26:18,644 --> 00:26:20,711
<i>as they're all digging</i>
<i>through their loot,</i>

548
00:26:20,713 --> 00:26:22,613
<i>there's this scream.</i>

549
00:26:22,615 --> 00:26:24,214
<i>All the kids</i>
<i>are rushed to the hospital,</i>

550
00:26:24,216 --> 00:26:25,983
<i>but it's too late.</i>

551
00:26:25,985 --> 00:26:29,053
<i>Johnny's dead from eating</i>
<i>candy laced with poison,</i>

552
00:26:29,055 --> 00:26:32,022
<i>and all the other kids</i>
<i>had their mouths ripped open</i>

553
00:26:32,024 --> 00:26:34,725
<i>from swallowing</i>
<i>razor blades and glass.</i>

554
00:26:34,727 --> 00:26:36,827
<i>They never did catch</i>
<i>the person who did it.</i>

555
00:26:36,829 --> 00:26:39,096
<i>Turns out, Halloween</i>
<i>really comes from</i>

556
00:26:39,098 --> 00:26:42,766
<i>the ancient custom of druids</i>
<i>collecting kids for sacrifices,</i>

557
00:26:42,768 --> 00:26:45,636
<i>and apparently these murders</i>
<i>were committed by those</i>

558
00:26:45,638 --> 00:26:48,072
<i>who still carry on</i>
<i>that evil tradition.</i>

559
00:26:49,808 --> 00:26:51,909
<i> So does our modern-day</i>
<i>custom of trick-or-treating</i>

560
00:26:51,911 --> 00:26:55,846
<i>really stem from evil druids</i>
<i>and child sacrifices?</i>

561
00:26:55,848 --> 00:26:58,315
<i>It's highly unlikely,</i>
<i>but there's no denying</i>

562
00:26:58,317 --> 00:27:00,985
<i>that something very sinister</i>
<i>is out there</i>

563
00:27:00,987 --> 00:27:04,989
<i>instilling panic and inciting</i>
<i>fear every Halloween.</i>

564
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:06,957
<i>There's one magical,</i>

565
00:27:06,959 --> 00:27:11,729
<i>haunted evening each year</i>
<i>when all the scary creatures</i>

566
00:27:11,731 --> 00:27:14,164
<i>come out to prowl through</i>
<i>every neighborhood.</i>

567
00:27:14,166 --> 00:27:16,233
<i>Most people enjoy having</i>
<i>trick-or-treaters</i>

568
00:27:16,235 --> 00:27:17,534
<i>come to their doors,</i>

569
00:27:17,536 --> 00:27:22,906
<i>but there are a few people who</i>
<i>will do things to hurt kids.</i>

570
00:27:22,908 --> 00:27:25,175
<i> The first documented</i>
<i>case of tainted candy</i>

571
00:27:25,177 --> 00:27:28,078
<i>happened on long island in 1964</i>

572
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,147
<i>when a housewife</i>
<i>named Helen pfeil,</i>

573
00:27:30,149 --> 00:27:32,249
<i>upset with older kids</i>
<i>for trick-or-treating,</i>

574
00:27:32,251 --> 00:27:35,052
<i>handed out dog biscuits,</i>
<i>steel wool,</i>

575
00:27:35,054 --> 00:27:36,954
<i>and poison ant buttons.</i>

576
00:27:36,956 --> 00:27:39,223
<i>Although pfeil testified</i>
<i>that it was just a joke,</i>

577
00:27:39,225 --> 00:27:42,326
<i>she was still found guilty</i>
<i>of endangering children.</i>

578
00:27:42,328 --> 00:27:44,962
<i>This fear really took root</i>
<i>in the 1970s</i>

579
00:27:44,964 --> 00:27:46,830
<i>when outlets like newsweek</i>
<i>were reporting</i>

580
00:27:46,832 --> 00:27:51,001
<i>that several children had died</i>
<i>from poison or tainted candy.</i>

581
00:27:51,003 --> 00:27:53,971
Some schools stopped
celebrating Halloween.

582
00:27:53,973 --> 00:27:56,407
They stopped using the word
"Halloween",

583
00:27:56,409 --> 00:27:59,743
and they start talking
about having a fall festival.

584
00:27:59,745 --> 00:28:05,249
New Jersey passed a law of
specifying penalties for people

585
00:28:05,251 --> 00:28:08,218
who were caught contaminating
Halloween treats.

586
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:13,323
<i>In the 1980s, hospitals</i>
<i>began offering X-ray treats.</i>

587
00:28:13,325 --> 00:28:15,259
<i> All nextcare urgent</i>
<i>care locations</i>

588
00:28:15,261 --> 00:28:18,796
<i>are offering free candy x-rays</i>
<i>through tomorrow.</i>

589
00:28:18,798 --> 00:28:18,796
We haven't had any instances

590
00:28:18,798 --> 00:28:22,099
where we found
any tampered candy,

591
00:28:22,101 --> 00:28:22,099
but you read it in the news

592
00:28:22,101 --> 00:28:25,402
and you see all of these
crazy pictures online,

593
00:28:25,404 --> 00:28:27,271
and so, you know,
if I were a parent,

594
00:28:27,273 --> 00:28:29,873
I would be a little bit
concerned as well.

595
00:28:31,309 --> 00:28:34,678
<i> We don't worry about</i>
<i>ghosts and goblins anymore,</i>

596
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,180
but we fear this maniac,

597
00:28:36,182 --> 00:28:40,284
this anonymous person
who is so crazy

598
00:28:40,286 --> 00:28:47,124
that he presumably poisons
little children at random.

599
00:28:47,126 --> 00:28:50,461
I think about how much fun
Halloween is.

600
00:28:50,463 --> 00:28:53,097
I also worry a little bit
about the things

601
00:28:53,099 --> 00:28:55,899
that can spoil
the fun of Halloween.

602
00:28:55,901 --> 00:28:59,803
Those kinds of things scare me,
too, but in a different way.

603
00:29:01,473 --> 00:29:03,073
<i>The one case of tainted candy</i>

604
00:29:03,075 --> 00:29:05,809
<i>that seemed to bring</i>
<i>this nightmare to life</i>

605
00:29:05,811 --> 00:29:09,446
<i>happened on a rainy Halloween</i>
<i>night in Pasadena, Texas.</i>

606
00:29:09,448 --> 00:29:11,148
<i>The perpetrator</i>
<i>of this evil crime</i>

607
00:29:11,150 --> 00:29:14,852
<i>is known to some</i>
<i>as the man who killed Halloween</i>

608
00:29:14,854 --> 00:29:19,189
<i>and to others as simply</i>
<i>the candy man.</i>

609
00:29:19,191 --> 00:29:21,959
<i>On October 31, 1974,</i>

610
00:29:21,961 --> 00:29:24,895
<i>after trick-or-treating</i>
<i>with their friends,</i>
<i>the bateses,</i>

611
00:29:24,897 --> 00:29:27,865
<i>Ronald o'Bryan let his son</i>
<i>Timothy, age 8,</i>

612
00:29:27,867 --> 00:29:29,867
<i>and his sister Elizabeth, 5,</i>

613
00:29:29,869 --> 00:29:32,503
<i>each pick out a piece of candy</i>
<i>before bed.</i>

614
00:29:32,505 --> 00:29:35,205
<i>Timothy, still wearing his</i>
<i>planet of the apes costume,</i>

615
00:29:35,207 --> 00:29:37,007
<i>chose a giant pixy styx,</i>

616
00:29:37,009 --> 00:29:38,776
<i>one of five</i>
<i>that his father had gotten</i>

617
00:29:38,778 --> 00:29:40,778
<i>from a neighborhood house</i>
<i>that night.</i>

618
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:43,080
<i>Ronald had divvyed up</i>
<i>the other styx to his daughter,</i>

619
00:29:43,082 --> 00:29:44,348
<i>one of the bates' kids,</i>

620
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:47,017
<i>and a local boy</i>
<i>named Whitney Parker.</i>

621
00:29:47,019 --> 00:29:48,752
<i>The sugar inside</i>
<i>had clumped together,</i>

622
00:29:48,754 --> 00:29:50,854
<i>so Ronald rolled the styx</i>
<i>in his hands</i>

623
00:29:50,856 --> 00:29:53,524
<i>before pouring the powder</i>
<i>down his son's throat.</i>

624
00:29:53,526 --> 00:29:56,160
<i>Minutes later,</i>
<i>Timothy was violently vomiting,</i>

625
00:29:56,162 --> 00:29:58,095
<i>and after being rushed</i>
<i>to the hospital,</i>

626
00:29:58,097 --> 00:30:00,030
<i>he was pronounced dead.</i>

627
00:30:00,032 --> 00:30:02,533
<i>The cause...</i>
<i>cyanide poisoning.</i>

628
00:30:02,535 --> 00:30:06,036
I was off duty at the time
on Halloween night

629
00:30:06,038 --> 00:30:09,840
when I received a call
from one of my detectives.

630
00:30:09,842 --> 00:30:11,775
<i>I drove to southmore hospital,</i>

631
00:30:11,777 --> 00:30:14,144
and what I saw
was very, very disturbing...

632
00:30:14,146 --> 00:30:17,414
not only because there was
a child there that was dead

633
00:30:17,416 --> 00:30:20,884
that had cyanide foam
coming out of his mouth,

634
00:30:20,886 --> 00:30:25,088
<i>but it was a small,</i>
<i>blond-headed young boy,</i>

635
00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:26,290
<i>and I looked at this child...</i>

636
00:30:26,292 --> 00:30:30,060
and I had at the time
a small, blond-headed,

637
00:30:30,062 --> 00:30:33,363
eight-year-old son
lying in a bed in my home...

638
00:30:33,365 --> 00:30:38,468
and it absolutely
just almost destroyed you

639
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:41,038
to see something like that.

640
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,372
<i> Had you ever heard</i>
<i>of the idea of</i>

641
00:30:42,374 --> 00:30:44,808
<i>candy tampering before that?</i>

642
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:45,809
<i>I had heard about it...</i>

643
00:30:45,811 --> 00:30:47,411
<i>I had never seen it personally,</i>

644
00:30:47,413 --> 00:30:51,849
but you know, you're always
concerned on Halloween,

645
00:30:51,851 --> 00:30:56,019
<i>and the next night</i>
<i>we had a grieving father,</i>

646
00:30:56,021 --> 00:30:59,356
a grieving mother,
and a grieving little sister.

647
00:30:59,358 --> 00:31:01,992
I put my arm around
Mr. o'Bryan's shoulder

648
00:31:01,994 --> 00:31:06,029
and I promised him,
"I promise you we will catch

649
00:31:06,031 --> 00:31:08,866
this individual
that did this to your son."

650
00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:12,169
<i> Timothy's death</i>
<i>was a terrible blow,</i>

651
00:31:12,171 --> 00:31:15,339
<i>not just for the family,</i>
<i>but for many in Pasadena.</i>

652
00:31:15,341 --> 00:31:17,407
<i>As crowds of o'Bryan's</i>
<i>fellow churchgoers</i>

653
00:31:17,409 --> 00:31:19,176
<i>flooded the cemetery,</i>

654
00:31:19,178 --> 00:31:22,246
<i>Timothy's father quickly</i>
<i>reduced the mourners to tears</i>

655
00:31:22,248 --> 00:31:26,850
<i>as he sang a hymn for the boy</i>
<i>who was now in heaven.</i>

656
00:31:26,852 --> 00:31:29,319
I introduced myself
to Mr. o'Bryan

657
00:31:29,321 --> 00:31:32,222
and said I'm a reporter
for the Houston chronicle.

658
00:31:32,224 --> 00:31:35,158
Is Mrs. o'Bryan
available to talk?

659
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:38,095
He said, you know,
she's really, as we all are,

660
00:31:38,097 --> 00:31:41,098
just torn up about this,
but if you want to talk,

661
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:44,301
come on in,
and I'll try to talk to you.

662
00:31:44,303 --> 00:31:47,271
<i>And he said, you know,</i>
<i>I held my son in my arms</i>

663
00:31:47,273 --> 00:31:51,341
<i>while he died, and I cried.</i>

664
00:31:51,343 --> 00:31:53,977
I thought
that they had been victimized

665
00:31:53,979 --> 00:31:57,881
by a random crazy man, lunatic.

666
00:31:57,883 --> 00:32:01,652
<i>The original suspects</i>
<i>were people in Pasadena</i>

667
00:32:01,654 --> 00:32:04,655
who were living inhabitants
of the homes

668
00:32:04,657 --> 00:32:07,524
where they did
the trick-or-treat.

669
00:32:07,526 --> 00:32:09,493
<i>4108, 4106,</i>

670
00:32:11,229 --> 00:32:12,229
<i>-102.</i>

671
00:32:12,231 --> 00:32:14,264
<i>Right here.</i>

672
00:32:14,266 --> 00:32:15,666
<i>4102.</i>

673
00:32:15,668 --> 00:32:17,901
<i>So right here</i>
<i>is the bates' house</i>

674
00:32:17,903 --> 00:32:21,571
<i>from where o'Bryan</i>
<i>and the bateses</i>

675
00:32:21,573 --> 00:32:23,407
both went trick-or-treating.

676
00:32:23,409 --> 00:32:24,608
<i>After the funeral,</i>

677
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:27,144
<i>the police took o'Bryan around</i>
<i>the bates' neighborhood,</i>

678
00:32:27,146 --> 00:32:28,378
<i>but he couldn't</i>
<i>remember the house</i>

679
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:30,314
<i>where he had gotten</i>
<i>the pixy styk.</i>

680
00:32:30,316 --> 00:32:34,017
<i>Finally, he ID'd a neighbor</i>
<i>named Courtney Melvin.</i>

681
00:32:34,019 --> 00:32:37,454
<i>Ten, right here</i>
<i>where this blue car is.</i>

682
00:32:37,456 --> 00:32:39,923
<i>This is Courtney Melvin's place,</i>

683
00:32:39,925 --> 00:32:43,026
<i>so basically Courtney</i>
<i>was out on his lawn.</i>

684
00:32:43,028 --> 00:32:45,495
<i>O'Bryan was driving by,</i>
<i>fingered this guy</i>

685
00:32:45,497 --> 00:32:48,498
<i>as being the person</i>
<i>where he got the pixy styx.</i>

686
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:49,933
<i>The only problem being</i>

687
00:32:49,935 --> 00:32:52,536
<i>Courtney Melvin</i>
<i>had an airtight alibi.</i>

688
00:32:54,439 --> 00:32:57,007
<i>As the killer continued</i>
<i>to elude police,</i>

689
00:32:57,009 --> 00:32:57,007
<i>the nature of his crime</i>

690
00:32:57,009 --> 00:33:01,278
<i>only seemed to confirm</i>
<i>everyone's worst fears...</i>

691
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:03,447
<i>a fear that still</i>
<i>resonates today.</i>

692
00:33:03,449 --> 00:33:05,415
<i>Do you know about the crime</i>
<i>that happened?</i>

693
00:33:05,417 --> 00:33:08,318
Oh, yes, you're talking about
the candy man.

694
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,320
<i>Yeah.</i>

695
00:33:09,321 --> 00:33:11,054
Uh-hm.
It was the first time

696
00:33:11,056 --> 00:33:13,090
that I heard of people
doing that...

697
00:33:13,092 --> 00:33:15,726
And then I heard of them
putting more cyanide

698
00:33:15,728 --> 00:33:17,394
and razor blades.

699
00:33:17,396 --> 00:33:19,062
I've heard fish hooks.

700
00:33:19,064 --> 00:33:21,498
<i>The way society is getting</i>
<i>right now, I mean,</i>

701
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:21,498
you don't ever know
what's going to happen.

702
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:26,436
I'm like, nope, no candy until
I look, you know, through it.

703
00:33:26,438 --> 00:33:27,437
<i>What are you looking for?</i>

704
00:33:27,439 --> 00:33:29,239
You know, an open wrapper,

705
00:33:29,241 --> 00:33:31,575
just seeing if anything
has a hole in it.

706
00:33:31,577 --> 00:33:32,676
You don't trust nobody.

707
00:33:32,678 --> 00:33:34,578
<i>- Yeah.</i>
- Can't.

708
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:36,179
I actually heard
about some guy doing it

709
00:33:36,181 --> 00:33:37,447
in this neighborhood one time,
but...

710
00:33:37,449 --> 00:33:37,447
What's that story.

711
00:33:37,449 --> 00:33:41,318
I think he actually lived
over there by the ditch.

712
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:44,354
And they do all sacrifice crap
over there during Halloween.

713
00:33:44,356 --> 00:33:46,423
Do you think there are
satanists around?

714
00:33:46,425 --> 00:33:47,591
There probably is.

715
00:33:47,593 --> 00:33:49,192
I mean, knowing this
neighborhood...

716
00:33:49,194 --> 00:33:50,560
there are sickos around here.

717
00:33:50,562 --> 00:33:50,560
<i>Tonight is Halloween</i>

718
00:33:50,562 --> 00:33:54,464
<i>and children will be out</i>
<i>to trick-or-treat.</i>

719
00:33:54,466 --> 00:33:56,767
<i>We hope that the treats</i>
<i>will be many</i>

720
00:33:56,769 --> 00:33:58,335
<i>and the tricks ingenious.</i>

721
00:33:58,337 --> 00:34:00,137
<i>But sometimes</i>
<i>people give children</i>

722
00:34:00,139 --> 00:34:02,339
<i>bad things on Halloween.</i>

723
00:34:02,341 --> 00:34:02,339
<i>In shreveport, Louisiana,</i>

724
00:34:02,341 --> 00:34:06,309
<i>an old legend that actually</i>
<i>happened this time.</i>

725
00:34:06,311 --> 00:34:06,309
<i>Halloween is on Sunday,</i>

726
00:34:06,311 --> 00:34:09,312
<i>and there is a spreading fear</i>
<i>that this year,</i>

727
00:34:09,314 --> 00:34:09,312
<i>the real Halloween scare</i>

728
00:34:09,314 --> 00:34:14,051
<i>will be many more cases</i>
<i>of contaminated treats.</i>

729
00:34:15,186 --> 00:34:17,654
<i> The term that gets used</i>
<i>is "Halloween sadist".</i>

730
00:34:17,656 --> 00:34:20,090
People assume
that the Halloween sadist

731
00:34:20,092 --> 00:34:24,094
was some crazy person who,
for some reason...

732
00:34:24,096 --> 00:34:28,065
presumably you know,
some psychological problem...

733
00:34:28,067 --> 00:34:32,135
<i>gets pleasure or satisfaction</i>
<i>from hurting little kids.</i>

734
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:34,639
<i>Many people believe</i>

735
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:38,675
<i>the Halloween sadist</i>
<i>was behind Timothy's death,</i>

736
00:34:38,677 --> 00:34:41,078
<i>but the real culprit</i>
<i>was more horrific</i>

737
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,813
<i>than anyone had ever imagined.</i>

738
00:34:46,317 --> 00:34:49,252
It's down here,
I think, on the left.

739
00:34:50,588 --> 00:34:52,823
<i>All right, so gray,</i>
<i>how do you want to do this?</i>

740
00:34:52,825 --> 00:34:54,324
I'll just, I'll hang back here.

741
00:34:54,326 --> 00:34:56,193
<i> Okay.</i>
<i>So we're going to go up.</i>

742
00:34:56,195 --> 00:34:57,594
I'm not totally into this.

743
00:34:57,596 --> 00:34:57,594
I can understand.

744
00:34:57,596 --> 00:35:00,664
I can understand
why you'd want to do this...

745
00:35:00,666 --> 00:35:00,664
<i>Yeah.</i>

746
00:35:00,666 --> 00:35:03,500
It just makes me feel
a little uncomfortable.

747
00:35:03,502 --> 00:35:03,500
Knocking on someone's house

748
00:35:03,502 --> 00:35:07,337
and telling them
what tragedy happened here.

749
00:35:07,339 --> 00:35:08,940
<i> Well, you wouldn't</i>
<i>want to know?</i>

750
00:35:14,579 --> 00:35:15,679
Oh, hey, how are you?

751
00:35:15,681 --> 00:35:15,679
Hi, how are you?

752
00:35:15,681 --> 00:35:19,216
Hey, sorry to bother you.
We wanted to talk to you.

753
00:35:19,218 --> 00:35:21,318
We're doing a documentary
and wanted to talk to you

754
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:23,353
about the family
that lived here before.

755
00:35:23,355 --> 00:35:24,355
Do you know him?

756
00:35:24,356 --> 00:35:25,422
Do you know
Ronald Clark o'Bryan?

757
00:35:25,424 --> 00:35:26,424
Uh-uh.

758
00:35:26,425 --> 00:35:28,492
No, you have no idea about him?

759
00:35:31,195 --> 00:35:32,496
Nah, don't worry about it.

760
00:35:33,431 --> 00:35:33,430
Thanks very much.

761
00:35:33,432 --> 00:35:37,334
You want to know?
Do you really want to know?

762
00:35:37,336 --> 00:35:38,668
Do you really want to know?

763
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:40,470
So the guy who lived in here

764
00:35:40,472 --> 00:35:42,739
was a guy named
Ronald Clark o'Bryan.

765
00:35:42,741 --> 00:35:44,641
He gave his son
a poison pixy styk.

766
00:35:46,444 --> 00:35:48,145
Yeah.
He killed...

767
00:35:49,881 --> 00:35:51,148
That's right.

768
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:54,818
<i>On Halloween night,</i>

769
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:57,754
<i>eight-year-old Timothy o'Bryan</i>
<i>of Pasadena, Texas,</i>

770
00:35:57,756 --> 00:36:00,490
<i>died after eating a piece of</i>
<i>trick-or-treat candy</i>

771
00:36:00,492 --> 00:36:02,159
<i>that contained cyanide.</i>

772
00:36:02,161 --> 00:36:04,761
<i>Today Pasadena police arrested</i>
<i>the boy's father,</i>

773
00:36:04,763 --> 00:36:07,330
<i>30-year-old Ronald o'Bryan,</i>
<i>on murder charges.</i>

774
00:36:07,332 --> 00:36:09,132
<i>Police refused to</i>
<i>discuss the case</i>

775
00:36:09,134 --> 00:36:10,901
<i>other than to say</i>
<i>the district attorney believes</i>

776
00:36:10,903 --> 00:36:14,337
<i>he has sufficient evidence</i>
<i>to file charges.</i>

777
00:36:16,707 --> 00:36:19,142
<i> After receiving a call</i>
<i>from an insurance agent,</i>

778
00:36:19,144 --> 00:36:21,745
<i>police discovered o'Bryan</i>
<i>had taken out a large policy</i>

779
00:36:21,747 --> 00:36:25,382
<i>on his kids but not himself</i>
<i>nor his wife.</i>

780
00:36:25,384 --> 00:36:25,382
<i>Even more damning,</i>

781
00:36:25,384 --> 00:36:29,386
<i>he had talked to</i>
<i>numerous people</i>
<i>about death by cyanide</i>

782
00:36:29,388 --> 00:36:31,288
<i>and had even tried</i>
<i>to buy the chemical</i>

783
00:36:31,290 --> 00:36:32,689
<i>from local companies.</i>

784
00:36:34,725 --> 00:36:36,693
<i>All evidence pointed</i>
<i>to Timothy's father</i>

785
00:36:36,695 --> 00:36:39,629
<i>as the killer which,</i>
<i>as horrific as it sounds,</i>

786
00:36:39,631 --> 00:36:41,364
<i>makes some sense,</i>

787
00:36:41,366 --> 00:36:44,401
<i>and that's because</i>
<i>the Halloween sadist is a myth,</i>

788
00:36:44,403 --> 00:36:45,902
<i>and the notion</i>
<i>of candy tampering</i>

789
00:36:45,904 --> 00:36:49,739
<i>is really an urban legend.</i>

790
00:36:49,741 --> 00:36:52,475
The idea that this is
a big social problem is a myth.

791
00:36:52,477 --> 00:36:54,744
I can't tell you
nobody has ever contaminated

792
00:36:54,746 --> 00:36:56,346
a piece of candy,

793
00:36:56,348 --> 00:37:01,952
but I can't find any evidence
that anybody has ever been hurt,

794
00:37:01,954 --> 00:37:05,488
seriously hurt or killed,
from a contaminated treat

795
00:37:05,490 --> 00:37:07,390
picked up in the course of
trick-or-treating.

796
00:37:07,392 --> 00:37:08,391
<i>If there's no such thing</i>

797
00:37:08,393 --> 00:37:09,626
<i>as the Halloween sadist,</i>

798
00:37:09,628 --> 00:37:12,562
<i>who is, in fact, doing that?</i>

799
00:37:12,564 --> 00:37:14,331
Probably the kids.

800
00:37:14,333 --> 00:37:15,198
<i>If you think about it,</i>

801
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,567
<i>this is a terrific</i>
<i>kind of prank.</i>

802
00:37:17,569 --> 00:37:19,903
<i>It's easy enough</i>
<i>to come by a pin,</i>

803
00:37:19,905 --> 00:37:22,405
<i>easy enough to stick it</i>
<i>in the candy bar,</i>

804
00:37:22,407 --> 00:37:24,908
and then run in and say,
look mom,

805
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:26,810
there's a pin in my candy bar...

806
00:37:26,812 --> 00:37:29,779
and you become the object
of the concerned attention

807
00:37:29,781 --> 00:37:32,983
of your parents
and possibly even the press

808
00:37:32,985 --> 00:37:34,384
and the police.

809
00:37:35,653 --> 00:37:38,355
<i> While the fear of</i>
<i>tainted candy may be hysteria,</i>

810
00:37:38,357 --> 00:37:40,557
<i>Timothy's death was real...</i>

811
00:37:40,559 --> 00:37:42,292
<i>but was it really conceivable</i>

812
00:37:42,294 --> 00:37:43,994
<i>that a father could kill</i>
<i>his own child...</i>

813
00:37:43,996 --> 00:37:49,366
<i>and if so, what kind of monster</i>
<i>was Ronald Clark o'Bryan?</i>

814
00:37:49,368 --> 00:37:52,636
Look at that lying
son of a bitch.

815
00:37:52,638 --> 00:37:55,438
<i>I thought just like Mr. o'Bryan</i>
<i>wanted us to think...</i>

816
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,873
that there was some maniac
out there

817
00:37:56,875 --> 00:38:01,511
randomly giving these poison
pixy styx to little kids.

818
00:38:01,513 --> 00:38:03,313
That's exactly what
he wanted us to think,

819
00:38:03,315 --> 00:38:04,681
and that's what we thought.

820
00:38:04,683 --> 00:38:10,520
It's hard to accept
that a human being

821
00:38:10,522 --> 00:38:11,855
was willing to do that,

822
00:38:11,857 --> 00:38:16,559
and it's still difficult
for all of us.

823
00:38:16,561 --> 00:38:21,798
The people in this case were
forever affected by what he did

824
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:24,734
and by that,
I mean the bates kids...

825
00:38:24,736 --> 00:38:27,704
he was going to kill
his friends own two kids...

826
00:38:27,706 --> 00:38:30,407
and little Whitney Parker,

827
00:38:30,409 --> 00:38:30,407
and he would have
killed his daughter

828
00:38:30,409 --> 00:38:34,544
if the ambulance and police
hadn't gotten there so fast.

829
00:38:34,546 --> 00:38:38,014
No good prosecutor wants to go
to trial at all on anything

830
00:38:38,016 --> 00:38:39,916
unless they believe
in their own heart

831
00:38:39,918 --> 00:38:43,053
that the defendant is guilty
beyond a reasonable doubt,

832
00:38:43,055 --> 00:38:45,655
and seeking the death penalty
is just an extra dimension

833
00:38:45,657 --> 00:38:49,592
of care and consideration
that should be given.

834
00:38:49,594 --> 00:38:50,727
You wanted to keep the case.

835
00:38:50,729 --> 00:38:52,062
I sure did.
Why?

836
00:38:52,064 --> 00:38:53,496
I wanted to hopefully
have a hand

837
00:38:53,498 --> 00:38:55,398
in seeing that justice was done

838
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,467
and that he would die
for what he did.

839
00:38:59,403 --> 00:39:01,304
<i>It took a jury only 45 minutes</i>

840
00:39:01,306 --> 00:39:03,039
<i>to find o'Bryan guilty</i>

841
00:39:03,041 --> 00:39:06,343
<i>and another 75</i>
<i>to sentence him to death.</i>

842
00:39:06,345 --> 00:39:06,343
<i>In a fitting irony,</i>

843
00:39:06,345 --> 00:39:13,883
<i>he was scheduled to die on</i>
<i>October 31, 1976, Halloween.</i>

844
00:39:13,885 --> 00:39:15,985
<i> I have stated</i>
<i>from the very beginning</i>

845
00:39:15,987 --> 00:39:19,556
<i>that I had absolutely</i>
<i>nothing at all to do with this.</i>

846
00:39:19,558 --> 00:39:21,391
<i>I maintain that now,</i>

847
00:39:21,393 --> 00:39:23,660
<i>and I'll willing</i>
<i>to take a polygraph now,</i>

848
00:39:23,662 --> 00:39:25,795
<i>just like I was</i>
<i>from the very first time</i>

849
00:39:25,797 --> 00:39:26,930
<i>that they arrested me.</i>

850
00:39:26,932 --> 00:39:26,930
<i>Because I have no guilt,</i>

851
00:39:26,932 --> 00:39:31,401
<i>I'm not worried about what</i>
<i>happens to my physical body.</i>

852
00:39:31,403 --> 00:39:34,437
<i>When I die,</i>
<i>I know where I'm going.</i>

853
00:39:34,439 --> 00:39:37,507
<i> You're going straight</i>
<i>to hell, buddy.</i>

854
00:39:37,509 --> 00:39:39,042
<i> All these appeals</i>
<i>have been turned down</i>

855
00:39:39,044 --> 00:39:40,845
<i>appeal after appeal,</i>
<i>and everybody is saying</i>

856
00:39:40,846 --> 00:39:43,346
<i>you will be executed</i>
<i>this Saturday.</i>

857
00:39:43,348 --> 00:39:45,815
<i>This could be</i>
<i>your last news conference.</i>

858
00:39:45,817 --> 00:39:47,884
<i>What are your final thoughts?</i>

859
00:39:47,886 --> 00:39:48,885
<i>As long as I have</i>

860
00:39:48,887 --> 00:39:51,855
<i>verifiable options open to me,</i>

861
00:39:51,857 --> 00:39:53,056
<i>I will pursue them.</i>

862
00:39:53,058 --> 00:39:56,059
<i>Are you ever going to change</i>

863
00:39:56,061 --> 00:39:58,561
<i>your proclamation of innocence</i>
<i>or...</i>

864
00:39:58,563 --> 00:40:01,097
<i> No,</i>
<i>why should I? It's the truth.</i>

865
00:40:01,099 --> 00:40:02,766
<i>When you consider victims,</i>

866
00:40:02,768 --> 00:40:06,403
<i>the victim of this crime</i>
<i>actually turns out to be me.</i>

867
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:08,071
<i>O'Bryan had been sent</i>

868
00:40:08,073 --> 00:40:11,674
<i>to Texas's infamous</i>
<i>huntsville prison</i>

869
00:40:11,676 --> 00:40:11,674
<i>which to this day,</i>

870
00:40:11,676 --> 00:40:15,812
<i>houses the most active</i>
<i>death chamber in the us,</i>

871
00:40:15,814 --> 00:40:17,514
<i>but this was 1982,</i>

872
00:40:17,516 --> 00:40:19,783
<i>and after a lengthy debate</i>
<i>in the supreme court</i>

873
00:40:19,785 --> 00:40:21,684
<i>and numerous stays of execution,</i>

874
00:40:21,686 --> 00:40:24,154
<i>o'Bryan was to be one</i>
<i>of the very first inmates</i>

875
00:40:24,156 --> 00:40:27,791
<i>to be executed with</i>
<i>the reinstituted death penalty.</i>

876
00:40:27,793 --> 00:40:29,492
<i>Yet, despite his crime,</i>

877
00:40:29,494 --> 00:40:32,395
<i>o'Bryan still managed</i>
<i>to find his supporters.</i>

878
00:40:32,397 --> 00:40:32,395
There were people

879
00:40:32,397 --> 00:40:38,067
who were in favor
of saving Ronald Clark o'Bryan

880
00:40:38,069 --> 00:40:40,103
in spite of
the overwhelming evidence

881
00:40:40,105 --> 00:40:41,671
and the horror of the crime.

882
00:40:41,673 --> 00:40:43,039
Their position was

883
00:40:43,041 --> 00:40:46,810
we are categorically
opposed to the death penalty.

884
00:40:46,812 --> 00:40:49,045
There also were
counter-protestors

885
00:40:49,047 --> 00:40:51,548
who were in favor
of the death penalty.

886
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:53,516
<i>They included a lot of students</i>

887
00:40:53,518 --> 00:40:55,685
<i>from the university located here</i>

888
00:40:55,687 --> 00:40:58,154
<i>including many who complained</i>

889
00:40:58,156 --> 00:41:00,590
about what had happened
to Halloween.

890
00:41:07,898 --> 00:41:09,199
This is Ronald Clark o'Bryan.

891
00:41:09,201 --> 00:41:11,601
Mr. o'Bryan is 39 years old.

892
00:41:11,603 --> 00:41:14,070
It looks like you are
going to be executed.

893
00:41:14,072 --> 00:41:15,538
Would you agree with that?

894
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:16,973
It's a possibility.

895
00:41:16,975 --> 00:41:18,675
I've been aware
of that possibility

896
00:41:18,677 --> 00:41:21,010
since the sentence
was handed down.

897
00:41:21,012 --> 00:41:22,879
It doesn't make it right.

898
00:41:22,881 --> 00:41:22,879
It's fair to say

899
00:41:22,881 --> 00:41:26,549
that nobody gets any joy
out of executing anybody,

900
00:41:26,551 --> 00:41:28,885
but it is also clear
that most Americans

901
00:41:28,887 --> 00:41:31,154
want to get on with this.

902
00:41:31,156 --> 00:41:33,723
<i>They are upset</i>
<i>that you're alive.</i>

903
00:41:33,725 --> 00:41:36,559
I-I can see that point, sure,
but here again,

904
00:41:36,561 --> 00:41:38,228
I don't think
that revenge is right.

905
00:41:38,230 --> 00:41:40,530
I don't think society
is entitled to revenge.

906
00:41:40,532 --> 00:41:44,000
<i>You are accused of ruining</i>
<i>Halloween for everybody.</i>

907
00:41:44,002 --> 00:41:46,236
Well,
that's a matter of opinion.

908
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:51,241
<i>March 31, 1984,</i>

909
00:41:51,243 --> 00:41:54,744
<i>the day of o'Bryan's execution</i>
<i>had finally arrived.</i>

910
00:41:54,746 --> 00:41:57,914
<i>He was to be executed</i>
<i>just after midnight.</i>

911
00:41:57,916 --> 00:42:00,583
<i>As the hour approached,</i>
<i>the frenzy outside</i>

912
00:42:00,585 --> 00:42:02,886
<i>reached a fever pitch.</i>

913
00:42:02,888 --> 00:42:04,954
<i> Demonstrators</i>
<i>were outside the prison</i>

914
00:42:04,956 --> 00:42:07,857
<i>waiting for the announcement</i>
<i>they wanted to hear.</i>

915
00:42:07,859 --> 00:42:10,994
<i>Parents of other murdered</i>
<i>children joined the vigil.</i>

916
00:42:10,996 --> 00:42:13,196
You know, how could anyone do
something to their own child?

917
00:42:13,198 --> 00:42:14,197
<i>Dying together.</i>

918
00:42:14,199 --> 00:42:15,598
What all of us would give

919
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:17,800
to have the chance
to have ours back.

920
00:42:20,504 --> 00:42:22,972
<i> Do you think Halloween</i>
<i>will ever be the same again?</i>

921
00:42:22,974 --> 00:42:27,110
<i>Oh, I don't think Halloween</i>
<i>has changed a great deal,</i>

922
00:42:28,913 --> 00:42:31,147
<i>except maybe gotten</i>
<i>a little safer.</i>

923
00:42:33,183 --> 00:42:35,084
<i><i>At exactly 12:40 A.M.</i>

924
00:42:35,086 --> 00:42:38,221
<i>O'Bryan was injected with</i>
<i>a lethal cocktail of drugs,</i>

925
00:42:38,223 --> 00:42:39,789
<i>twice the normal amount,</i>

926
00:42:39,791 --> 00:42:42,659
<i>to account for</i>
<i>his 250-pound weight.</i>

927
00:42:42,661 --> 00:42:44,227
<i>After o'Bryan's eyes fluttered,</i>

928
00:42:44,229 --> 00:42:47,196
<i>his chest heaved,</i>
<i>and it was over.</i>

929
00:42:49,099 --> 00:42:50,166
<i>Ronald o'Bryan,</i>

930
00:42:50,168 --> 00:42:52,635
<i>the man fellow inmates</i>
<i>called the candy man,</i>

931
00:42:52,637 --> 00:42:54,871
<i>was killed by lethal injection</i>
<i>this morning</i>

932
00:42:54,873 --> 00:42:56,673
<i>at a huntsville, Texas, prison.</i>

933
00:42:56,675 --> 00:42:58,841
<i> Ronald o'Bryan</i>
<i>went to his deathbed</i>

934
00:42:58,843 --> 00:43:01,978
<i>never admitting</i>
<i>that he killed his own son.</i>

935
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:01,978
<i>But in a final statement,</i>

936
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:06,783
<i>the condemned man</i>
<i>did ask to be forgiven.</i>

937
00:43:06,785 --> 00:43:09,819
<i>Also to anyone</i>
<i>I have offended in any way</i>

938
00:43:09,821 --> 00:43:12,956
<i>during my 39 years.</i>

939
00:43:12,958 --> 00:43:15,024
<i>I pray and ask your forgiveness,</i>

940
00:43:15,026 --> 00:43:18,227
<i>just as I forgive anyone</i>
<i>who offended me in any way.</i>

941
00:43:18,229 --> 00:43:20,296
<i>Ronald o'Bryan is dead.</i>

942
00:43:20,298 --> 00:43:24,067
<i>His ex-wife sees the execution</i>
<i>as the end of a nightmare,</i>

943
00:43:24,069 --> 00:43:27,103
<i>and a chance</i>
<i>for a brand new beginning.</i>

944
00:43:28,839 --> 00:43:31,240
<i> For many the idea</i>
<i>that we were killing the man</i>

945
00:43:31,242 --> 00:43:34,577
<i>who killed Halloween</i>
<i>seemed justified.</i>

946
00:43:34,579 --> 00:43:38,648
<i>O'Bryan had to die</i>
<i>so we could have our fun back.</i>

947
00:43:38,650 --> 00:43:40,984
People were celebrating it,
there's no question about it,

948
00:43:40,986 --> 00:43:44,120
<i>but it was</i>
<i>kind of a catharsis, really,</i>

949
00:43:44,122 --> 00:43:46,923
<i>and people welcomed the event.</i>

950
00:43:46,925 --> 00:43:51,661
He really had not just
desecrated the family tie,

951
00:43:51,663 --> 00:43:54,197
<i>but he had actually</i>
<i>in some fundamental way</i>

952
00:43:54,199 --> 00:43:57,834
<i>desecrated the idea of Halloween</i>

953
00:43:57,836 --> 00:44:04,641
by taking a scary story
and literally making it true.

954
00:44:04,643 --> 00:44:04,641
<i>What he did is</i>

955
00:44:04,643 --> 00:44:08,144
<i>he used the urban legend</i>
<i>as a smokescreen.</i>

956
00:44:08,146 --> 00:44:10,980
<i>He used it as an alibi.</i>

957
00:44:10,982 --> 00:44:12,281
<i>I couldn't have done it</i>

958
00:44:12,283 --> 00:44:14,384
<i>because this is</i>
<i>the sort of thing</i>

959
00:44:14,386 --> 00:44:17,220
that an anonymous
creepy killer would do,

960
00:44:17,222 --> 00:44:20,356
and we all know that
because of urban legends.

961
00:44:20,358 --> 00:44:21,524
<i>In the ultimate irony,</i>

962
00:44:21,526 --> 00:44:25,028
<i>o'Bryan's decision to enact</i>
<i>the tainted candy myth</i>

963
00:44:25,030 --> 00:44:28,031
<i>turned fiction into reality,</i>

964
00:44:28,033 --> 00:44:31,834
<i>allowing the candy man</i>
<i>to continue haunting Halloween</i>

965
00:44:31,836 --> 00:44:33,736
<i>for generations to come.</i>

966
00:44:35,639 --> 00:44:39,709
Look, it's right there.

967
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:44,847
<i>Mr. o'Bryan, your case</i>

968
00:44:44,849 --> 00:44:49,786
<i>has probably created terror</i>
<i>in the hearts of parents.</i>

969
00:44:49,788 --> 00:44:52,221
<i>In fact, I'm told</i>
<i>that the inmates</i>

970
00:44:52,223 --> 00:44:55,825
<i>occasionally refer to you</i>
<i>as the candy man, is that so?</i>

971
00:45:02,433 --> 00:45:04,233
<i>A babysitter is watching TV</i>

972
00:45:04,235 --> 00:45:05,835
<i>after putting the kids to bed</i>

973
00:45:05,837 --> 00:45:08,237
<i>when she gets a call</i>
<i>from a mysterious stranger.</i>

974
00:45:11,710 --> 00:45:12,775
Hello.

975
00:45:12,777 --> 00:45:14,811
Have you checked the children?

976
00:45:14,813 --> 00:45:14,811
What?

977
00:45:14,813 --> 00:45:17,980
<i> Thinking it's a prank,</i>
<i>she hangs up.</i>

978
00:45:17,982 --> 00:45:17,980
<i>A few minutes later,</i>

979
00:45:17,982 --> 00:45:20,917
<i>the same mysterious man</i>
<i>calls again.</i>

980
00:45:20,919 --> 00:45:21,951
Hello?

981
00:45:21,953 --> 00:45:24,120
Have you checked the children?

982
00:45:24,122 --> 00:45:25,755
<i>Only now the question ends</i>

983
00:45:25,757 --> 00:45:27,356
with a devilish laugh.

984
00:45:27,358 --> 00:45:29,392
<i>The babysitter reports the call.</i>

985
00:45:29,394 --> 00:45:31,060
Hello, could you
get me the police.

986
00:45:31,062 --> 00:45:33,863
I've been getting
weird phone calls.

987
00:45:33,865 --> 00:45:35,932
<i> After a few minutes,</i>
<i>a hurried voice calls back.</i>

988
00:45:37,769 --> 00:45:37,767
Leave me alone!

989
00:45:37,769 --> 00:45:40,403
<i> Jill,</i>
<i>this is sergeant sachar.</i>

990
00:45:40,405 --> 00:45:42,338
<i>Listen to me.</i>
<i>We've traced the call.</i>

991
00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:44,307
The caller is in the house.

992
00:45:44,309 --> 00:45:46,876
<i>The calls are coming</i>
<i>from the house.</i>

993
00:45:46,878 --> 00:45:48,945
<i>It's coming from</i>
<i>inside the house.</i>

994
00:45:48,947 --> 00:45:51,280
<i> Just at that moment,</i>
<i>the babysitter looks over</i>

995
00:45:51,282 --> 00:45:53,850
<i>as a man is coming</i>
<i>down the stairs.</i>

996
00:45:59,156 --> 00:46:02,058
Well, that really happened
to a girl in my hometown.

997
00:46:02,060 --> 00:46:04,861
Oh, yes. I'm sure it did.

998
00:46:04,863 --> 00:46:07,730
I'm sure most of you grew up

999
00:46:07,732 --> 00:46:11,134
thinking that this happened
to girls in all your hometowns,

1000
00:46:11,136 --> 00:46:13,669
but it didn't.

1001
00:46:14,738 --> 00:46:17,206
<i> Yes, the babysitter</i>
<i>and the man upstairs</i>

1002
00:46:17,208 --> 00:46:19,008
<i>is a popular urban legend,</i>

1003
00:46:19,010 --> 00:46:21,444
<i>but is there any truth</i>
<i>behind it?</i>

1004
00:46:21,446 --> 00:46:24,280
<i>One would think so</i>
<i>considering all these examples,</i>

1005
00:46:24,282 --> 00:46:26,349
<i>but when dealing</i>
<i>with urban legends,</i>

1006
00:46:26,351 --> 00:46:28,985
<i>the truth is never</i>
<i>quite what it seems.</i>

1007
00:46:32,352 --> 00:46:34,391
<i>When I think babysitter,</i>

1008
00:46:34,392 --> 00:46:37,493
<i>I think about me babysitting</i>
<i>as a teenager</i>

1009
00:46:37,495 --> 00:46:39,929
and how fearful I was.

1010
00:46:39,931 --> 00:46:42,498
You know,
being in a strange house,

1011
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:45,968
hearing strange sounds,
not being familiar,

1012
00:46:45,970 --> 00:46:47,203
but what was interesting

1013
00:46:47,205 --> 00:46:49,405
is that I started researching
babysitters,

1014
00:46:49,407 --> 00:46:51,374
thinking that I wouldn't
have a hard time

1015
00:46:51,376 --> 00:46:53,042
finding a case of a babysitter

1016
00:46:53,044 --> 00:46:56,546
<i>by following some kind of</i>
<i>death or kidnapping,</i>

1017
00:46:56,548 --> 00:47:00,116
the children upstairs
being killed or whatever.

1018
00:47:00,118 --> 00:47:02,885
It's very difficult to find
any true crimes

1019
00:47:02,887 --> 00:47:04,287
to connect
this urban legend line.

1020
00:47:04,289 --> 00:47:04,287
<i>One thing that's interesting</i>

1021
00:47:04,289 --> 00:47:09,158
<i>about babysitting is that it</i>
<i>doesn't increase your danger</i>

1022
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:10,993
of being attacked at all.

1023
00:47:10,995 --> 00:47:13,396
<i>It would be</i>
<i>a completely random event</i>

1024
00:47:13,398 --> 00:47:17,867
<i>for a babysitter to be attacked</i>
<i>during a house burglary,</i>

1025
00:47:17,869 --> 00:47:21,270
<i>but it induces anxiety</i>
<i>because suddenly</i>

1026
00:47:21,272 --> 00:47:23,840
they're responsible for
these other people's kids,

1027
00:47:23,842 --> 00:47:25,441
<i>and it has nothing to do</i>
<i>with your potential</i>

1028
00:47:25,443 --> 00:47:27,009
<i>for becoming a crime victim...</i>

1029
00:47:27,011 --> 00:47:29,545
<i>but it may be getting it</i>
<i>expressed in stories</i>

1030
00:47:29,547 --> 00:47:31,914
<i>in which the babysitter</i>
<i>becomes the crime victim.</i>

1031
00:47:31,916 --> 00:47:33,549
<i> You would think</i>
<i>with the amount of babysitters</i>

1032
00:47:33,551 --> 00:47:35,418
getting killed
in popular culture now,

1033
00:47:35,420 --> 00:47:37,954
like, we would have just like
gotten a case immediately.

1034
00:47:37,956 --> 00:47:39,555
Oh, it took me
to going back to the '50s

1035
00:47:39,557 --> 00:47:41,424
to actually find one.

1036
00:47:41,426 --> 00:47:44,026
We found this case
of janett christman

1037
00:47:44,028 --> 00:47:47,496
here in Columbia, Missouri,
which is why we're here.

1038
00:47:55,005 --> 00:47:58,407
<i>My name is Carol Haley holt,</i>

1039
00:47:58,409 --> 00:48:03,079
and I was a very good friend
of janett christman

1040
00:48:03,081 --> 00:48:08,117
from first grade
through the time of her death.

1041
00:48:09,553 --> 00:48:14,023
<i>It was march 18, 1950.</i>

1042
00:48:14,025 --> 00:48:18,294
Janett was babysitting
for the romack family

1043
00:48:18,296 --> 00:48:20,897
out kind of in the west edge
of Columbia...

1044
00:48:20,899 --> 00:48:23,599
it really wasn't
in the city limits.

1045
00:48:23,601 --> 00:48:26,502
<i>It was kind of an eerie night.</i>

1046
00:48:26,504 --> 00:48:30,907
<i>I also was babysitting,</i>
<i>and I just felt uneasy,</i>

1047
00:48:30,909 --> 00:48:32,375
<i>and that was unusual for me</i>

1048
00:48:32,377 --> 00:48:34,577
<i>because I did</i>
<i>quite a bit of babysitting...</i>

1049
00:48:34,579 --> 00:48:39,148
but I just felt that something
was going on about 12 o'clock,

1050
00:48:39,150 --> 00:48:41,217
and I even got up
to check the door

1051
00:48:41,219 --> 00:48:42,318
and make sure it was locked,

1052
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:43,552
went in to check
the little boy...

1053
00:48:43,554 --> 00:48:45,554
he was fine.

1054
00:48:45,556 --> 00:48:48,958
And then the next morning,
the phone rang.

1055
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:51,160
My mother went in to answer

1056
00:48:51,162 --> 00:48:53,029
<i>and told me that janett</i>
<i>had been killed</i>

1057
00:48:53,031 --> 00:48:54,397
<i>while she was babysitting.</i>

1058
00:48:54,598 --> 00:48:55,598
<i>I had heard that</i>

1059
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:59,368
there had been a phone call
to the police.

1060
00:48:59,370 --> 00:49:02,038
Well, Mrs. romack tried to call

1061
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:06,208
to check on janett
with the thunder,

1062
00:49:06,210 --> 00:49:08,945
and she was afraid
the little boy might wake up...

1063
00:49:08,947 --> 00:49:12,214
and she tried to call
and received a busy signal.

1064
00:49:13,584 --> 00:49:15,318
<i> What the romack</i>
<i>family didn't know</i>

1065
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:17,019
<i>is that janett</i>
<i>had called the police</i>

1066
00:49:17,021 --> 00:49:18,454
<i>while she was being attacked,</i>

1067
00:49:18,456 --> 00:49:22,091
<i>but the only thing they heard</i>
<i>were desperate screams.</i>

1068
00:49:22,093 --> 00:49:23,426
<i>Unable to trace the call,</i>

1069
00:49:23,428 --> 00:49:25,928
<i>the police were helpless</i>
<i>to stop her murder.</i>

1070
00:49:28,632 --> 00:49:33,469
Janett had skin
under her fingernails.

1071
00:49:36,139 --> 00:49:40,409
She had many abrasions
on her body,

1072
00:49:40,411 --> 00:49:43,012
<i>but the final thing was</i>

1073
00:49:43,014 --> 00:49:47,083
that she was strangled
with an ironing cord.

1074
00:49:49,186 --> 00:49:54,023
I know she suffered a lot
before she finally succumbed.

1075
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:57,426
<i>Janett christman's death</i>

1076
00:49:57,428 --> 00:50:00,162
<i>shocked the small town</i>
<i>of Columbia, Missouri,</i>

1077
00:50:00,164 --> 00:50:02,231
<i>but despite being one of</i>
<i>the most publicized crimes</i>

1078
00:50:02,233 --> 00:50:03,733
<i>in the past 60 years,</i>

1079
00:50:03,735 --> 00:50:06,535
<i>her murder</i>
<i>has never been solved.</i>

1080
00:50:06,537 --> 00:50:09,739
So right now, we're looking
for ed romack's house

1081
00:50:09,741 --> 00:50:11,974
where janett christman
was murdered

1082
00:50:11,976 --> 00:50:14,243
while she was babysitting.

1083
00:50:14,245 --> 00:50:16,645
1015 should be
somewhere along here.

1084
00:50:16,647 --> 00:50:18,447
<i>So then it must be that one.</i>

1085
00:50:18,449 --> 00:50:20,449
<i>That house right there?</i>
<i>Right there, right there.</i>

1086
00:50:22,252 --> 00:50:23,986
<i>Quick question for you,</i>

1087
00:50:23,988 --> 00:50:26,455
<i>is this where ed romack</i>
<i>used to live?</i>

1088
00:50:26,457 --> 00:50:27,523
<i>Is that this house?</i>

1089
00:50:27,525 --> 00:50:27,523
<i>Maybe.</i>

1090
00:50:27,525 --> 00:50:30,159
<i> But you don't know</i>
<i>anything about it.</i>

1091
00:50:34,164 --> 00:50:35,564
Uh-hm.

1092
00:50:35,566 --> 00:50:38,734
About two years ago,
this car pulled up

1093
00:50:38,736 --> 00:50:42,738
and they were out there talking
and pointing here at this house,

1094
00:50:42,740 --> 00:50:45,241
and they said
we're trying to figure out

1095
00:50:45,243 --> 00:50:49,512
which house where a girl
was babysitting a little baby,

1096
00:50:49,514 --> 00:50:51,514
and she got murdered and raped.

1097
00:50:51,516 --> 00:50:51,514
<i>Uh-hm.</i>

1098
00:50:51,516 --> 00:50:53,616
And I said, no,
it's not this house,

1099
00:50:53,618 --> 00:50:54,717
it's that one.

1100
00:50:54,719 --> 00:50:54,717
<i>Uh-hm.</i>

1101
00:50:54,719 --> 00:50:58,421
It was a man talking to me.
He said, "I was the baby."

1102
00:50:58,423 --> 00:50:59,588
<i>No!</i>

1103
00:50:59,590 --> 00:50:59,588
<i>Wow!</i>

1104
00:50:59,590 --> 00:51:03,225
And a different woman that
lived across west boulevard,

1105
00:51:03,227 --> 00:51:05,594
and she had been
raped and murdered

1106
00:51:05,596 --> 00:51:08,597
sometime within close
to that time.

1107
00:51:08,599 --> 00:51:10,032
<i> Jenkins is it?</i>
Yes.

1108
00:51:10,034 --> 00:51:11,167
<i>Jenkins, right.</i>

1109
00:51:11,169 --> 00:51:13,202
We went to...
I went to the trial. Yeah.

1110
00:51:13,204 --> 00:51:15,337
<i> Marylou Jenkins</i>
<i>was the other reason</i>

1111
00:51:15,339 --> 00:51:17,206
<i>we were in Columbia.</i>

1112
00:51:17,208 --> 00:51:21,310
<i>On February 6, 1946,</i>
<i>marylou, age 20,</i>

1113
00:51:21,312 --> 00:51:22,611
<i>was home alone</i>
<i>while her mother was out</i>

1114
00:51:22,613 --> 00:51:25,314
<i>caring for an elderly neighbor.</i>

1115
00:51:25,316 --> 00:51:27,716
<i>The next morning she came home</i>
<i>to find marylou dead.</i>

1116
00:51:27,718 --> 00:51:30,352
<i>Much like janett christman's</i>
<i>murder four years later,</i>

1117
00:51:30,354 --> 00:51:31,787
<i>marylou had been raped</i>
<i>and strangled</i>

1118
00:51:31,789 --> 00:51:33,589
<i>with an electrical cord.</i>

1119
00:51:35,292 --> 00:51:37,626
<i>A mentally-challenged man</i>
<i>named Floyd Cochran</i>

1120
00:51:37,628 --> 00:51:39,728
<i>who had been arrested</i>
<i>for killing his wife</i>

1121
00:51:39,730 --> 00:51:42,798
<i>was charged with the murder</i>
<i>and quickly executed.</i>

1122
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:45,067
<i>Do you think Floyd was innocent?</i>

1123
00:51:45,069 --> 00:51:47,203
I think
he was likely innocent

1124
00:51:47,205 --> 00:51:49,672
of killing marylou Jenkins, yes.

1125
00:51:49,674 --> 00:51:54,110
He did kill his wife
in likely a domestic dispute,

1126
00:51:54,112 --> 00:51:56,745
but just from reading
the trial transcripts,

1127
00:51:56,747 --> 00:51:58,781
it just didn't seem like
he had the wherewithal

1128
00:51:58,783 --> 00:52:02,084
to kill and rape a young woman.

1129
00:52:02,086 --> 00:52:04,286
Mary Beth brown
is a researcher

1130
00:52:04,288 --> 00:52:07,089
who helped shed new light
on these old cold cases.

1131
00:52:07,091 --> 00:52:08,757
<i>She believes</i>
<i>the eerie similarities</i>

1132
00:52:08,759 --> 00:52:11,327
<i>between the Jenkins murder</i>
<i>and the christman murder</i>

1133
00:52:11,329 --> 00:52:14,763
<i>four years later</i>
<i>only proves</i>
<i>Cochran's innocence.</i>

1134
00:52:14,765 --> 00:52:17,666
They were both young woman,
they were home by themselves,

1135
00:52:17,668 --> 00:52:20,302
they were both found
with electrical cords

1136
00:52:20,304 --> 00:52:20,302
wrapped around their neck,

1137
00:52:20,304 --> 00:52:25,841
but cords that weren't attached
or torn from the appliance...

1138
00:52:25,843 --> 00:52:25,841
they were actually cut.

1139
00:52:25,843 --> 00:52:30,346
The whole location thing
is the one that really gets me.

1140
00:52:30,348 --> 00:52:31,614
<i>Like how close was it?</i>

1141
00:52:31,616 --> 00:52:33,182
<i>Within two blocks.</i>

1142
00:52:33,184 --> 00:52:35,317
<i> Do you think</i>
<i>that the same person</i>

1143
00:52:35,319 --> 00:52:40,356
who killed marylou Jenkins
also killed janett christman?

1144
00:52:40,358 --> 00:52:43,893
That's my personal opinion,
but yeah.

1145
00:52:43,895 --> 00:52:45,494
<i>And who do you think did it?</i>

1146
00:52:45,496 --> 00:52:46,896
I've been told several people,

1147
00:52:46,898 --> 00:52:50,466
but more than any other name
was Robert Mueller.

1148
00:52:50,468 --> 00:52:50,466
<i>Robert Mueller</i>

1149
00:52:50,468 --> 00:52:53,802
<i>was a high school friend</i>
<i>of ed romack's,</i>

1150
00:52:53,804 --> 00:52:55,471
<i>and it was the romack's house</i>

1151
00:52:55,473 --> 00:52:57,540
<i>where janett was babysitting</i>
<i>that night.</i>

1152
00:52:57,542 --> 00:52:59,375
<i>The romacks told police</i>
<i>that Mueller</i>

1153
00:52:59,377 --> 00:53:01,810
<i>had often commented</i>
<i>on janett being a virgin</i>

1154
00:53:01,812 --> 00:53:05,614
<i>and had eluded to knowing</i>
<i>intimate details of the crime.</i>

1155
00:53:05,616 --> 00:53:07,616
<i>Although Mueller had been</i>
<i>taken in for questioning</i>

1156
00:53:07,618 --> 00:53:10,219
<i>and passed a polygraph,</i>
<i>the police still felt</i>

1157
00:53:10,221 --> 00:53:12,454
<i>there was enough evidence</i>
<i>to arrest him.</i>

1158
00:53:12,456 --> 00:53:14,857
<i>However, a grand jury</i>
<i>refused to indict,</i>

1159
00:53:14,859 --> 00:53:17,826
<i>and Mueller was never tried</i>
<i>for janett's murder.</i>

1160
00:53:19,329 --> 00:53:21,830
<i> I am working</i>
<i>on a documentary,</i>

1161
00:53:21,832 --> 00:53:23,766
and I'm interested
in a cold case

1162
00:53:23,768 --> 00:53:23,766
that I've been researching.

1163
00:53:23,768 --> 00:53:26,402
I wanted to see
if there was any information

1164
00:53:26,404 --> 00:53:28,504
that you could give me.

1165
00:53:28,506 --> 00:53:28,504
Okay, is that...

1166
00:53:28,506 --> 00:53:31,407
did you just like
do something on your system

1167
00:53:31,409 --> 00:53:33,309
and you see
there's nothing there?

1168
00:53:33,311 --> 00:53:34,476
<i>Despite numerous efforts</i>

1169
00:53:34,478 --> 00:53:35,711
<i>to reach out to police,</i>

1170
00:53:35,713 --> 00:53:37,980
<i>they were less than responsive.</i>

1171
00:53:37,982 --> 00:53:40,849
<i>Christman's case was too old</i>
<i>to warrant attention.</i>

1172
00:53:40,851 --> 00:53:44,353
<i>However, we were able to</i>
<i>track down some old case files.</i>

1173
00:53:44,355 --> 00:53:47,256
This deputy testified
that romack told him

1174
00:53:47,258 --> 00:53:49,892
Mueller had known janett

1175
00:53:49,894 --> 00:53:53,762
and admired
her well-developed form.

1176
00:53:53,764 --> 00:53:56,865
<i>Oh my God!</i>

1177
00:53:58,368 --> 00:54:00,302
<i>There's her leg.</i>

1178
00:54:00,304 --> 00:54:02,771
<i>There's the phone.</i>

1179
00:54:02,773 --> 00:54:06,842
That's the cord
around her neck, right there.

1180
00:54:06,844 --> 00:54:11,413
<i>It's one of those irons</i>
<i>back then with the thick cords.</i>

1181
00:54:11,415 --> 00:54:11,413
<i>That's the window</i>
<i>that was broken</i>

1182
00:54:11,415 --> 00:54:15,451
<i>that supposedly</i>
<i>whoever did this</i>
<i>went in and out of,</i>

1183
00:54:15,453 --> 00:54:15,451
<i>but the venetian blinds...</i>

1184
00:54:15,453 --> 00:54:17,920
<i>if someone were going</i>
<i>through there...</i>

1185
00:54:17,922 --> 00:54:19,822
<i>they'd be totally ripped up.</i>

1186
00:54:19,824 --> 00:54:21,390
The piano, look.

1187
00:54:21,392 --> 00:54:23,525
That's the window...
oh, look.

1188
00:54:23,527 --> 00:54:23,525
<i>That's the broken glass</i>

1189
00:54:23,527 --> 00:54:23,525
<i>and that's why they're saying</i>
<i>nothing is disturbed</i>

1190
00:54:23,527 --> 00:54:28,797
<i>because look at the area</i>
<i>around it.</i>

1191
00:54:28,799 --> 00:54:30,499
So, inside job.

1192
00:54:30,501 --> 00:54:30,499
Uh-hm.

1193
00:54:30,501 --> 00:54:33,402
Mueller's wife,
according to the deputy,

1194
00:54:33,404 --> 00:54:37,239
had called the girl to baby sit
at the Mueller home that night

1195
00:54:37,241 --> 00:54:39,675
and found she had already
been asked by Mrs. romack.

1196
00:54:39,677 --> 00:54:40,976
<i>So, Mueller tried to get her</i>

1197
00:54:40,978 --> 00:54:41,978
<i>to baby sit that night.</i>

1198
00:54:41,979 --> 00:54:43,445
Must have been.

1199
00:54:43,447 --> 00:54:46,615
And she was already
babysitting the romacks...

1200
00:54:49,419 --> 00:54:51,754
which was how he would know
she would be alone.

1201
00:54:51,756 --> 00:54:53,322
I agree that it sounds
like he did it,

1202
00:54:53,324 --> 00:54:57,293
but maybe, maybe he didn't.

1203
00:54:57,295 --> 00:55:00,529
There's no solid proof,
no hard evidence.

1204
00:55:02,299 --> 00:55:05,501
<i> Joan sorrels is another</i>
<i>researcher studying the cases.</i>

1205
00:55:05,503 --> 00:55:05,501
<i>She believes other crimes</i>

1206
00:55:05,503 --> 00:55:08,304
<i>happening in Columbia</i>
<i>at the time</i>

1207
00:55:08,306 --> 00:55:10,906
<i>might be connected</i>
<i>to these murders.</i>

1208
00:55:10,908 --> 00:55:12,041
There were rapes

1209
00:55:12,043 --> 00:55:15,344
that had occurred
within that period

1210
00:55:15,346 --> 00:55:18,814
between the Jenkins murder
and the christman murder.

1211
00:55:18,816 --> 00:55:19,816
Tell me about those.

1212
00:55:19,817 --> 00:55:21,517
Yeah. Well, there was a rape

1213
00:55:21,519 --> 00:55:25,654
that was within two blocks
of the christman murder.

1214
00:55:25,656 --> 00:55:29,792
The girl was raped by a man
that wore a mask...

1215
00:55:29,794 --> 00:55:30,794
Really?

1216
00:55:30,795 --> 00:55:30,793
And when you read the stories...

1217
00:55:30,795 --> 00:55:33,929
the reports
of the christman murder...

1218
00:55:33,931 --> 00:55:35,864
when they're talking
about Robert Mueller,

1219
00:55:35,866 --> 00:55:39,368
<i>it turns out that he was</i>
<i>interested in the theater</i>

1220
00:55:39,370 --> 00:55:42,371
<i>and that he made masks.</i>

1221
00:55:42,373 --> 00:55:46,041
There was a black man named
Jake Bradford that they charged,

1222
00:55:46,043 --> 00:55:48,077
and he had already been in jail,

1223
00:55:48,079 --> 00:55:51,647
and he was charged on the rapes.

1224
00:55:51,649 --> 00:55:53,649
You assume he was innocent.

1225
00:55:53,651 --> 00:55:55,050
Of that.

1226
00:55:55,052 --> 00:55:58,520
They took the wrong man,
they really did.

1227
00:55:58,522 --> 00:56:00,789
Would you say that Columbia
has like a history of this?

1228
00:56:00,791 --> 00:56:02,558
Well, you remember
that I was graduating

1229
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:04,526
from high school in '51.

1230
00:56:04,528 --> 00:56:06,395
You would go
to the mu football games

1231
00:56:06,397 --> 00:56:07,996
and you would stand up
for Dixie.

1232
00:56:07,998 --> 00:56:10,099
What does that mean?

1233
00:56:10,101 --> 00:56:11,567
The song<i> dixies</i>...

1234
00:56:11,569 --> 00:56:12,801
Uh-hm, okay.

1235
00:56:12,803 --> 00:56:14,470
That's a confederate song.

1236
00:56:14,472 --> 00:56:14,470
Uh-hm.

1237
00:56:14,472 --> 00:56:20,342
Columbia was really primarily
a confederate town.

1238
00:56:22,479 --> 00:56:24,780
Basically this is the story
of a young girl...

1239
00:56:24,782 --> 00:56:25,781
<i>We came here to investigate</i>

1240
00:56:25,783 --> 00:56:25,781
<i>an urban legend,</i>

1241
00:56:25,783 --> 00:56:29,017
<i>but what we found</i>
<i>was truly shocking...</i>

1242
00:56:29,019 --> 00:56:31,353
<i>the unsolved murders</i>
<i>of two young girls,</i>

1243
00:56:31,355 --> 00:56:33,889
<i>a series of brutal rapes,</i>
<i>and the possibility</i>

1244
00:56:33,891 --> 00:56:38,460
<i>that men were being falsely</i>
<i>accused and even executed.</i>

1245
00:56:38,462 --> 00:56:41,630
<i>In all honesty, the truth</i>
<i>was more unflinchingly real</i>

1246
00:56:41,632 --> 00:56:43,665
<i>than we could ever</i>
<i>have imagined.</i>

1247
00:56:43,667 --> 00:56:46,802
<i>So right now, we are headed</i>
<i>to hinkson creek.</i>

1248
00:56:46,804 --> 00:56:48,837
This is where
a lot of people went to park

1249
00:56:48,839 --> 00:56:52,541
back in the '50s, and '40s,
'50s, '60s and still do now.

1250
00:56:52,543 --> 00:56:53,675
Yeah.

1251
00:56:56,379 --> 00:56:57,780
We just wanted to see
about all the other rapes

1252
00:56:57,782 --> 00:57:00,416
that were happening
other than the two houses.

1253
00:57:00,418 --> 00:57:03,085
This is the creek
where they're saying

1254
00:57:03,087 --> 00:57:05,854
there were a ton of rapes
happening around here.

1255
00:57:11,394 --> 00:57:12,594
<i>That.</i>

1256
00:57:14,097 --> 00:57:16,031
<i>This is where</i>
<i>the college students go in,</i>

1257
00:57:16,033 --> 00:57:17,766
<i>and there's like a car</i>
<i>right out over there</i>

1258
00:57:17,768 --> 00:57:19,067
<i>and they just flashed</i>
<i>their lights</i>

1259
00:57:19,069 --> 00:57:22,738
because they didn't want us
to walk in on them.

1260
00:57:25,542 --> 00:57:26,675
What's down here?

1261
00:57:26,677 --> 00:57:28,844
Uh, where they dragged the girl.

1262
00:57:28,846 --> 00:57:32,581
<i> Dragged?</i>
Dragged from the car.

1263
00:57:32,583 --> 00:57:34,483
There was a couple making out.

1264
00:57:34,485 --> 00:57:36,652
Some guy came out of nowhere

1265
00:57:36,654 --> 00:57:39,087
and then at gunpoint
pulled one of the girls off

1266
00:57:39,089 --> 00:57:42,057
into the woods... and it was
right near Halloween...

1267
00:57:42,059 --> 00:57:45,894
and basically this guy
put a mask over his head

1268
00:57:45,896 --> 00:57:49,465
<i>and then he put a mask</i>
<i>over the girl's face,</i>

1269
00:57:49,467 --> 00:57:49,465
<i>and then he raped her.</i>

1270
00:57:49,467 --> 00:57:52,968
I think the more scary thing
was being a woman,

1271
00:57:52,970 --> 00:57:57,940
being a girl between
1940 and 1950, in this area,

1272
00:57:57,942 --> 00:58:00,876
knowing the amount of things
going on.

1273
00:58:00,878 --> 00:58:02,778
I wouldn't have wanted to be
a babysitter back then.

1274
00:58:02,780 --> 00:58:05,080
I wouldn't have wanted
to be by myself

1275
00:58:05,082 --> 00:58:05,080
in one of those houses.

1276
00:58:05,082 --> 00:58:10,085
Most teenagers in the us
go through a period

1277
00:58:10,087 --> 00:58:12,154
when they baby sit
at least once or twice,

1278
00:58:12,156 --> 00:58:16,558
<i>and it feels very terrifying</i>
<i>to the person who is doing it,</i>

1279
00:58:17,595 --> 00:58:20,128
<i>But it's not actually dangerous</i>
<i>almost at all.</i>

1280
00:58:20,130 --> 00:58:22,531
<i>I mean, there's no reason</i>
<i>to imagine</i>

1281
00:58:22,533 --> 00:58:25,067
<i>that any killer would even know</i>

1282
00:58:25,069 --> 00:58:27,536
<i>that a babysitter was on duty</i>
<i>in the house,</i>

1283
00:58:27,538 --> 00:58:29,972
<i>and it makes the most sense</i>
<i>if you think about the fact</i>

1284
00:58:29,974 --> 00:58:33,075
<i>that maybe he knew she was</i>
<i>going to be there babysitting</i>

1285
00:58:33,077 --> 00:58:35,210
and maybe
he did this specifically

1286
00:58:35,212 --> 00:58:37,179
to torment the babysitter,

1287
00:58:37,181 --> 00:58:39,114
and that is
exactly what happened,

1288
00:58:39,116 --> 00:58:41,817
they think,
in the Columbia case.

1289
00:58:41,819 --> 00:58:44,853
<i> Was somebody tormenting</i>
<i>the babysitters in Columbia...</i>

1290
00:58:44,855 --> 00:58:47,723
<i>and was the same person</i>
<i>responsible for the sex crimes</i>

1291
00:58:47,725 --> 00:58:49,658
<i>that had terrorized this town...</i>

1292
00:58:49,660 --> 00:58:53,962
<i>and finally</i>
<i>was this same person</i>
<i>Robert Mueller?</i>

1293
00:58:53,964 --> 00:58:55,764
<i>Hoping for some</i>
<i>additional insight,</i>

1294
00:58:55,766 --> 00:58:58,233
<i>we turned to a profiler</i>
<i>in Kansas City,</i>

1295
00:58:58,235 --> 00:59:00,969
<i>a former German national</i>
<i>named Peter brendt</i>

1296
00:59:00,971 --> 00:59:03,005
<i>who was willing to review</i>
<i>our case.</i>

1297
00:59:03,007 --> 00:59:06,842
<i>So in your opinion,</i>
<i>the same killer for both girls.</i>

1298
00:59:06,844 --> 00:59:08,677
<i>Yes.</i>
<i>This is too specific</i>

1299
00:59:08,679 --> 00:59:11,013
<i>if you add</i>
<i>all of the details together.</i>

1300
00:59:11,015 --> 00:59:13,181
Do you think
that marylou Jenkins knew him?

1301
00:59:13,183 --> 00:59:16,218
<i>Well, there was no sign</i>
<i>of forced entry on the door,</i>

1302
00:59:16,220 --> 00:59:21,056
<i>so at least from the sight,</i>
<i>she must have known him,</i>

1303
00:59:21,058 --> 00:59:23,825
<i>and he was non threatening</i>
<i>to her.</i>

1304
00:59:23,827 --> 00:59:26,795
Right.
Now let's talk about christman.

1305
00:59:26,797 --> 00:59:29,631
<i> Oh, well,</i>
<i>this is a lot more specifics</i>.

1306
00:59:29,633 --> 00:59:32,000
<i>If you see</i>
<i>there comes an offender,</i>

1307
00:59:32,002 --> 00:59:33,168
<i>he breaks a window.</i>

1308
00:59:33,170 --> 00:59:35,771
<i>The victim runs to the kitchen</i>
<i>where the phone is,</i>

1309
00:59:35,773 --> 00:59:38,073
<i>and he walks in</i>
<i>through the front door.</i>

1310
00:59:38,075 --> 00:59:40,576
<i>Now, why would he do that?</i>

1311
00:59:40,578 --> 00:59:43,579
<i>He would do that</i>
<i>only if he knew one detail...</i>

1312
00:59:43,581 --> 00:59:48,684
<i>ed romack had shown her</i>
<i>how to use the shortcut.</i>

1313
00:59:48,686 --> 00:59:50,686
<i> Peter had brought up</i>
<i>an interesting clue...</i>

1314
00:59:50,688 --> 00:59:52,321
<i>one that many had overlooked.</i>

1315
00:59:52,323 --> 00:59:54,089
<i>Romack testified</i>
<i>that he had shown janett</i>

1316
00:59:54,091 --> 00:59:56,558
<i>a loaded shotgun</i>
<i>by the front door.</i>

1317
00:59:56,560 --> 00:59:56,558
<i>By breaking the window,</i>

1318
00:59:56,560 --> 00:59:59,828
<i>Mueller would distract her</i>
<i>away from the gun</i>

1319
00:59:59,830 --> 01:00:03,298
<i>so he could safely</i>
<i>get inside the house.</i>

1320
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:06,935
<i>He knew how long he would need</i>
<i>around the house,</i>

1321
01:00:06,937 --> 01:00:08,971
<i>through the front door</i>
<i>into the kitchen.</i>

1322
01:00:08,973 --> 01:00:13,942
<i>So he knew every feet</i>
<i>of the route.</i>

1323
01:00:13,944 --> 01:00:15,577
Do you think it was Mueller?

1324
01:00:15,579 --> 01:00:17,012
<i>He fits the bill,</i>

1325
01:00:17,014 --> 01:00:18,981
<i>but a lot of other males</i>
<i>of the town</i>

1326
01:00:18,983 --> 01:00:20,849
<i>would fit that bill, too.</i>

1327
01:00:20,851 --> 01:00:24,119
<i>And the problem is</i>
<i>he passed his lie detector.</i>

1328
01:00:24,121 --> 01:00:30,158
<i>Now, if you have even 20%</i>
<i>to 40% cycle passes it makes...</i>

1329
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:31,827
<i>a lie detector,</i>

1330
01:00:31,829 --> 01:00:34,830
<i>especially an old model</i>
<i>from the '50s,</i>

1331
01:00:34,832 --> 01:00:39,868
<i>um, well, it's worthless.</i>

1332
01:00:39,870 --> 01:00:39,868
Now the other interesting thing

1333
01:00:39,870 --> 01:00:44,873
is that the rapes and murders
stopped when he left town.

1334
01:00:44,875 --> 01:00:48,210
<i>Well, that looks not good</i>
<i>on the other side.</i>

1335
01:00:48,212 --> 01:00:53,248
<i>What was it, half a million</i>
<i>young males went to Korea?</i>

1336
01:00:53,250 --> 01:00:56,385
<i>So he wasn't the only one</i>
<i>who left the area.</i>

1337
01:00:56,387 --> 01:00:59,021
<i>I mean he would</i>
<i>so nicely fit the bill,</i>

1338
01:00:59,023 --> 01:01:03,725
<i>but that's the risky part</i>
<i>with profiles, yeah?</i>

1339
01:01:03,727 --> 01:01:06,194
<i>A profile states</i>
<i>not who the killer is</i>

1340
01:01:06,196 --> 01:01:08,864
<i>but what the killer is.</i>

1341
01:01:08,866 --> 01:01:09,865
<i>I think it's interesting</i>

1342
01:01:09,867 --> 01:01:12,100
<i>that he thinks whoever this is,</i>

1343
01:01:12,102 --> 01:01:15,671
he knew her...
he knew both.

1344
01:01:15,673 --> 01:01:17,005
<i> Although we'll</i>
<i>never be able to prove</i>

1345
01:01:17,007 --> 01:01:18,874
<i>who committed all these crimes,</i>

1346
01:01:18,876 --> 01:01:20,308
<i>the evidence strongly suggests</i>

1347
01:01:20,310 --> 01:01:23,645
<i>that janett christman</i>
<i>knew her killer.</i>

1348
01:01:23,647 --> 01:01:28,383
There really is not
a strong tradition in America

1349
01:01:28,385 --> 01:01:32,854
of strangers coming in
and killing babysitters.

1350
01:01:32,856 --> 01:01:36,992
<i>Babysitters killing</i>
<i>small children, yes,</i>

1351
01:01:36,994 --> 01:01:40,729
<i>but the stranger</i>
<i>on babysitter story</i>

1352
01:01:40,731 --> 01:01:47,736
just doesn't connect up with
a widespread real social fear.

1353
01:01:51,708 --> 01:01:54,209
<i> What the babysitter</i>
<i>and the man upstairs</i>

1354
01:01:54,211 --> 01:01:57,145
<i>seems to be about</i>
<i>is this warning</i>

1355
01:01:57,147 --> 01:01:59,081
<i>about this kind of</i>
<i>responsibility.</i>

1356
01:01:59,083 --> 01:02:00,449
If you're taking
this responsibility,

1357
01:02:00,451 --> 01:02:02,084
you have to take it seriously.

1358
01:02:02,086 --> 01:02:04,786
So, you have this voice
that calls her up on the phone

1359
01:02:04,788 --> 01:02:06,421
and almost like a conscience,

1360
01:02:06,423 --> 01:02:08,290
asks have you checked
the children,

1361
01:02:08,292 --> 01:02:10,258
<i>and she hasn't</i>
<i>checked the children,</i>

1362
01:02:10,260 --> 01:02:12,828
<i>and that's one of the reasons</i>
<i>why she doesn't know</i>

1363
01:02:12,830 --> 01:02:14,763
<i>that they've been murdered.</i>

1364
01:02:16,132 --> 01:02:18,066
<i>I think it makes more sense</i>

1365
01:02:18,068 --> 01:02:20,102
<i>to look at it in a simple way</i>

1366
01:02:20,104 --> 01:02:25,273
and say the babysitter is
dealing with her own anxieties

1367
01:02:25,275 --> 01:02:29,978
of being potentially the cause
of the children's death...

1368
01:02:29,980 --> 01:02:34,349
and the killer upstairs
is the killer upstairs for her.

1369
01:02:34,351 --> 01:02:36,318
The tragic case
of janett christman

1370
01:02:36,320 --> 01:02:38,987
<i>only goes to prove</i>
<i>bill Ellis's point</i>

1371
01:02:38,989 --> 01:02:42,791
<i>that our portrayal of the man</i>
<i>upstairs is incorrect...</i>

1372
01:02:42,793 --> 01:02:45,260
<i>and that's because the truth</i>
<i>is more terrifying</i>

1373
01:02:45,262 --> 01:02:47,229
<i>than we can ever imagine.</i>

1374
01:02:47,231 --> 01:02:49,231
<i>Janett christman</i>
<i>knew her killer,</i>

1375
01:02:49,233 --> 01:02:51,767
<i>and if it's true</i>
<i>that her killer was Mueller</i>

1376
01:02:51,769 --> 01:02:54,402
<i>as so many in Columbia</i>
<i>have suggested,</i>

1377
01:02:54,404 --> 01:02:57,239
<i>then the man tormenting her</i>
<i>that fateful night</i>

1378
01:02:57,241 --> 01:02:59,474
<i>wasn't any stranger.</i>

1379
01:03:13,022 --> 01:03:15,190
<i>So now we go from</i>
<i>Columbia, Missouri,</i>

1380
01:03:15,192 --> 01:03:17,793
<i>to Chicago in the 1980s...</i>

1381
01:03:17,795 --> 01:03:19,995
<i>from the small town</i>
<i>to the big city.</i>

1382
01:03:22,031 --> 01:03:24,900
<i>For some,</i>
<i>it is a loss of innocence,</i>

1383
01:03:24,902 --> 01:03:29,004
<i>and nothing speaks to that loss</i>
<i>more than clowns.</i>

1384
01:03:30,541 --> 01:03:33,408
<i>We used to think of clowns</i>
<i>as fairly happy characters.</i>

1385
01:03:33,410 --> 01:03:35,844
<i>Yes, sometimes</i>
<i>they were sad or hapless,</i>

1386
01:03:35,846 --> 01:03:38,380
<i>but ultimately they were</i>
<i>harmless caricatures.</i>

1387
01:03:38,382 --> 01:03:41,983
<i>Of course, clown faces</i>
<i>were exaggerated and garish,</i>

1388
01:03:41,985 --> 01:03:43,451
<i>but that's because of</i>
<i>the far distances</i>

1389
01:03:43,453 --> 01:03:45,921
<i>between the audience</i>
<i>and the ring.</i>

1390
01:03:45,923 --> 01:03:49,357
<i>It wasn't the clown's fault,</i>
<i>or was it?</i>

1391
01:03:50,893 --> 01:03:52,427
<i>Before modern times,</i>
<i>the clown...</i>

1392
01:03:52,429 --> 01:03:54,429
<i>or more appropriately</i>
<i>the Jester...</i>

1393
01:03:54,431 --> 01:03:56,398
<i>was considered</i>
<i>a mischievous trickster</i>

1394
01:03:56,400 --> 01:04:00,135
<i>whose special role</i>
<i>allowed them to mock nobility.</i>

1395
01:04:00,137 --> 01:04:03,371
<i>Jesters served to entertain,</i>
<i>but it wasn't all smiles.</i>

1396
01:04:03,373 --> 01:04:08,276
<i>These clowns had a mean streak,</i>
<i>and they played it to the hilt.</i>

1397
01:04:08,278 --> 01:04:10,879
<i>But what was it</i>
<i>about the clowns of today</i>

1398
01:04:10,881 --> 01:04:14,883
<i>that turned them</i>
<i>into something evil?</i>

1399
01:04:17,487 --> 01:04:18,954
Breakfast.

1400
01:04:20,590 --> 01:04:22,924
I'm hungry.

1401
01:04:24,026 --> 01:04:25,560
<i> Some believe</i>
<i>it was when we brought clowns</i>

1402
01:04:25,562 --> 01:04:27,896
<i>out of the big top</i>
<i>and into our homes</i>

1403
01:04:27,898 --> 01:04:30,031
<i>via birthday parties and TV,</i>

1404
01:04:30,033 --> 01:04:32,868
<i>that things</i>
<i>really began to change.</i>

1405
01:04:32,870 --> 01:04:36,204
We see you here as bozo.
Who are you really?

1406
01:04:36,206 --> 01:04:38,306
<i> Had that</i>
<i>suspicious gleam in the eye</i>

1407
01:04:38,308 --> 01:04:39,975
<i>been there all along?</i>

1408
01:04:39,977 --> 01:04:42,911
<i>Did we finally just put</i>
<i>two and two together to realize</i>

1409
01:04:42,913 --> 01:04:46,414
<i>that clowns were creepy</i>
<i>or even worse...</i>

1410
01:04:46,416 --> 01:04:48,049
<i>dangerous?</i>

1411
01:04:48,051 --> 01:04:50,585
<i>The news at 5.</i>

1412
01:04:50,587 --> 01:04:52,420
<i>Chicago police warned parents</i>

1413
01:04:52,422 --> 01:04:56,524
<i>about a man dressed as a clown</i>
<i>who is approaching children.</i>

1414
01:04:56,526 --> 01:04:58,593
<i>Police say a clown</i>
<i>tried to lure boys</i>

1415
01:04:58,595 --> 01:05:01,863
<i>into his pickup truck</i>
<i>last Tuesday evening.</i>

1416
01:05:01,865 --> 01:05:03,365
<i>Police have issued</i>
<i>two community alerts</i>

1417
01:05:03,367 --> 01:05:06,868
<i>regarding the clown sighting</i>
<i>near some southside schools</i>

1418
01:05:06,870 --> 01:05:09,271
<i>as well as</i>
<i>some westside schools.</i>

1419
01:05:10,006 --> 01:05:11,006
<i>No one can say for sure</i>

1420
01:05:11,008 --> 01:05:15,510
<i>where in Chicago</i>
<i>it happened first or even when,</i>

1421
01:05:17,113 --> 01:05:21,583
<i>but they were out there,</i>
<i>snatching kids off the streets.</i>

1422
01:05:21,585 --> 01:05:24,352
<i>They trolled playgrounds</i>
<i>and schoolyards.</i>

1423
01:05:24,354 --> 01:05:26,421
<i>Sometimes they used</i>
<i>balloons or candy</i>

1424
01:05:26,423 --> 01:05:28,356
<i>to lure the gullible ones.</i>

1425
01:05:30,426 --> 01:05:32,327
<i>But ask anyone</i>
<i>who has seen them,</i>

1426
01:05:32,329 --> 01:05:34,896
<i>and they'll all tell you</i>
<i>the same thing...</i>

1427
01:05:34,898 --> 01:05:37,198
<i>it was the white van</i>
<i>they saw first</i>

1428
01:05:39,168 --> 01:05:41,903
<i>and then that face</i>
<i>behind the wheel</i>

1429
01:05:41,905 --> 01:05:44,639
<i>painted white</i>
<i>with a maniacal smile.</i>

1430
01:05:47,176 --> 01:05:49,945
<i>We call them the killer clowns,</i>

1431
01:05:49,947 --> 01:05:52,447
<i>and they only wanted</i>
<i>one thing...</i>

1432
01:05:52,449 --> 01:05:56,484
<i>to kidnap kids just like us.</i>

1433
01:05:57,687 --> 01:05:59,020
<i> Police are saying</i>
<i>that the suspect</i>

1434
01:05:59,022 --> 01:06:01,189
<i>wears clown make-up, a wig,</i>

1435
01:06:01,191 --> 01:06:03,224
<i>and sometimes</i>
<i>he carried balloons.</i>

1436
01:06:03,226 --> 01:06:03,224
<i>The latest pair of incidents</i>

1437
01:06:03,226 --> 01:06:06,995
<i>occurred near playgrounds</i>
<i>at 83rd and mackinaw...</i>

1438
01:06:06,997 --> 01:06:08,697
They were running out
of the playground area.

1439
01:06:08,699 --> 01:06:11,232
To prey on children
at this time, you know,

1440
01:06:11,234 --> 01:06:13,568
right around the time
that they want to go out

1441
01:06:13,570 --> 01:06:16,438
and do trick-or-treating
is unfortunate.

1442
01:06:16,440 --> 01:06:19,007
We should emphasize
that nothing has happened...

1443
01:06:19,009 --> 01:06:19,007
no child has been hurt...

1444
01:06:19,009 --> 01:06:23,111
but certainly these incidents
that have been near children

1445
01:06:23,113 --> 01:06:25,113
is making it very uneasy.

1446
01:06:29,685 --> 01:06:32,120
<i> In 2008, this was</i>
<i>one of the reported sightings...</i>

1447
01:06:32,122 --> 01:06:33,021
South mackinaw...

1448
01:06:33,023 --> 01:06:35,991
one of the theoretical
clown abductions

1449
01:06:35,993 --> 01:06:38,593
where apparently he was hiding
in the playground

1450
01:06:38,595 --> 01:06:40,061
with some balloons...

1451
01:06:40,063 --> 01:06:42,063
Or he was in a van
or he was in a truck.

1452
01:06:42,065 --> 01:06:44,065
<i>I mean, no adult</i>
<i>said they saw this.</i>

1453
01:06:44,067 --> 01:06:46,034
<i>Something was going on</i>
<i>with these children</i>

1454
01:06:46,036 --> 01:06:50,271
to feel the need
to alert adults.

1455
01:06:50,273 --> 01:06:51,373
You doing a documentary?

1456
01:06:51,375 --> 01:06:51,373
Yeah, we are.

1457
01:06:51,375 --> 01:06:53,742
<i> Do you believe</i>
<i>that really happened?</i>

1458
01:06:53,744 --> 01:06:54,809
Yeah, oh sure.

1459
01:06:54,811 --> 01:06:56,244
<i> Why do you believe</i>
<i>that happened?</i>

1460
01:06:56,246 --> 01:06:57,512
Well, people told me, you know,

1461
01:06:57,514 --> 01:06:59,414
that they actually seen that.

1462
01:06:59,416 --> 01:07:01,216
Was it just one incident
or was it...

1463
01:07:01,218 --> 01:07:03,385
No, it was like a couple weeks
or you know,

1464
01:07:03,387 --> 01:07:05,653
a month or something like
that it was going on.

1465
01:07:05,655 --> 01:07:07,055
<i>Did they ever catch the guy?</i>

1466
01:07:07,057 --> 01:07:07,055
I'm not sure.

1467
01:07:07,057 --> 01:07:09,657
I think they did
because it stopped.

1468
01:07:09,659 --> 01:07:12,193
Definitely
it was a true incident.

1469
01:07:12,195 --> 01:07:14,062
Uh-hm.
Uh-hm.

1470
01:07:14,064 --> 01:07:14,062
So, he believes...

1471
01:07:14,064 --> 01:07:17,298
He believes it.
It was-it was real.

1472
01:07:17,300 --> 01:07:19,567
I think there could possibly
have been a clown here.

1473
01:07:19,569 --> 01:07:21,403
It's hard to discern.

1474
01:07:21,405 --> 01:07:23,705
A white van
and the guy had a mask...

1475
01:07:23,707 --> 01:07:25,573
Uh-hm.
...Of a clown.

1476
01:07:25,575 --> 01:07:27,709
One of our friends' daughters...

1477
01:07:27,711 --> 01:07:29,210
yeah, and she was holding on

1478
01:07:29,212 --> 01:07:30,645
like for dear life to the fence.

1479
01:07:30,647 --> 01:07:32,180
<i> Really?</i>
Yeah.

1480
01:07:32,182 --> 01:07:33,782
<i> Do you believe</i>
<i>it really happened?</i>

1481
01:07:33,784 --> 01:07:33,782
I believe so.

1482
01:07:33,784 --> 01:07:37,052
We have tons and tons
of pedophiles

1483
01:07:37,054 --> 01:07:39,054
in this community.
I always log on to it.

1484
01:07:39,056 --> 01:07:40,088
<i> Really?</i>
Oh yes.

1485
01:07:40,090 --> 01:07:41,189
Dressing as a clown?

1486
01:07:41,191 --> 01:07:41,189
Yeah.

1487
01:07:41,191 --> 01:07:43,725
That's a little extreme,
don't you think?

1488
01:07:43,727 --> 01:07:43,725
No.

1489
01:07:43,727 --> 01:07:43,725
<i>But you never saw the clown.</i>

1490
01:07:43,727 --> 01:07:49,064
No, but we saw people
that acted like that person...

1491
01:07:49,066 --> 01:07:49,064
trying to lure...
tell the kids.

1492
01:07:49,066 --> 01:07:53,468
I saw him right in the store
and I warned the store owner.

1493
01:07:53,470 --> 01:07:54,803
I'd like for people
to hear the truth

1494
01:07:54,805 --> 01:07:57,072
Not a lie.

1495
01:07:58,208 --> 01:08:00,141
Now I don't know what to think.

1496
01:08:00,143 --> 01:08:02,177
<i> Walking away,</i>
<i>it was hard not to believe</i>

1497
01:08:02,179 --> 01:08:04,412
that there must be
some truth to this.

1498
01:08:04,414 --> 01:08:06,548
Could all these people
really be wrong?

1499
01:08:06,550 --> 01:08:10,118
Maybe our fear of clowns
isn't just in our heads.

1500
01:08:11,720 --> 01:08:14,389
<i> Coulrophobia</i>
<i>is the fear of clowns.</i>

1501
01:08:14,391 --> 01:08:16,658
It is so widespread now

1502
01:08:16,660 --> 01:08:19,828
everybody knows that people
are afraid of clowns.

1503
01:08:19,830 --> 01:08:22,564
Everybody knows that something
is up with clowns,

1504
01:08:22,566 --> 01:08:25,533
<i>and the last couple of decades</i>
<i>have just been confirmation</i>

1505
01:08:25,535 --> 01:08:27,302
<i>of everything they ever feared.</i>

1506
01:08:27,304 --> 01:08:27,302
<i>But what's even more disturbing</i>

1507
01:08:27,304 --> 01:08:32,740
<i>is that these phantom clowns</i>
<i>didn't just appear in 2008.</i>

1508
01:08:32,742 --> 01:08:35,577
<i>There was a similar sighting</i>
<i>17 years previously,</i>

1509
01:08:35,579 --> 01:08:38,613
<i>in the fall of 1991.</i>

1510
01:08:38,615 --> 01:08:40,615
<i>From the number of</i>

1511
01:08:40,617 --> 01:08:43,118
<i>coming from practically</i>
<i>all over Chicago,</i>

1512

<i>police are theorizing</i>

1513
01:08:44,488 --> 01:08:46,654
there may be more
than one phony clown

1514
01:08:46,656 --> 01:08:48,790
out roaming the streets.

1515
01:08:48,792 --> 01:08:49,858
<i>This is a comment.</i>

1516
01:08:49,860 --> 01:08:51,726
<i>"I've seen the same van</i>
<i>with the clown driving</i>

1517

<i>when we was on the westside</i>
<i>playing,</i>

1518
01:08:54,297 --> 01:08:56,464

<i>stopping in the alley</i>

1519
01:08:56,466 --> 01:08:58,766
<i>and the clown trying to</i>
<i>lure me to the van.</i>

1520
01:08:58,768 --> 01:08:58,766
<i>That scared me worser</i>

1521
01:08:58,768 --> 01:09:02,537
than living in cabrini-green
projects."

1522
01:09:02,539 --> 01:09:05,340
<i> The mention of</i>
<i>cabrini-green was telling.</i>

1523
01:09:05,342 --> 01:09:08,476
<i>It had been one of Chicago's</i>
<i>most notorious slums</i>

1524
01:09:08,478 --> 01:09:12,680
<i>where kids faced</i>
<i>rampant poverty and</i>
<i>violence on a daily basis.</i>

1525
01:09:12,682 --> 01:09:13,848
<i>But how does a kid process</i>

1526
01:09:13,850 --> 01:09:15,650
<i>these overwhelming</i>
<i>societal issues</i>

1527
01:09:15,652 --> 01:09:18,319
<i>that are just too big to fix?</i>

1528
01:09:18,321 --> 01:09:19,821
Have you ever like
heard of any talk

1529
01:09:19,823 --> 01:09:21,689
about any scary place
on your block,

1530
01:09:21,691 --> 01:09:23,124
<i>a place nobody went to?</i>

1531
01:09:23,126 --> 01:09:25,560
Every block is a scary block...

1532
01:09:25,562 --> 01:09:27,495
So much shooting
and killing out here.

1533
01:09:27,497 --> 01:09:29,197
You guys think clowns are scary?

1534
01:09:29,199 --> 01:09:30,231
Clowns?
Yeah.

1535
01:09:30,233 --> 01:09:31,866
No.

1536
01:09:31,868 --> 01:09:32,868
<i>Killer clowns.</i>

1537
01:09:32,869 --> 01:09:34,169
Killer clowns.

1538
01:09:35,905 --> 01:09:39,207
We've got a real shot here,
Bernadette.

1539
01:09:39,209 --> 01:09:40,875
An entire community
starts attributing

1540
01:09:40,877 --> 01:09:44,646
the daily horrors of their lives
to a mythical figure.

1541
01:09:44,648 --> 01:09:46,848
<i>Sometimes we create monsters.</i>

1542
01:09:46,850 --> 01:09:50,151
<i>Sometimes we just need</i>
<i>to put a face on our fear.</i>

1543
01:09:51,453 --> 01:09:53,855
Aren't you going to say hello?

1544
01:09:54,823 --> 01:09:56,758
This is where there was

1545
01:09:56,760 --> 01:10:01,529
another series of
clown sightings back in '91.

1546
01:10:01,531 --> 01:10:03,898
<i>They called this clown sighting</i>
<i>the homey the clown sighting.</i>

1547
01:10:03,900 --> 01:10:05,100
<i>Back in the early '90s,</i>

1548
01:10:05,101 --> 01:10:07,602
<i>there was a popular show on,</i>
<i>in living colors.</i>

1549
01:10:07,604 --> 01:10:09,904
Huge character on there,
homey the clown.

1550
01:10:09,906 --> 01:10:12,407
Now let's show them
how homey gets back at

1551
01:10:12,409 --> 01:10:13,575
Mr. establishment.

1552
01:10:15,345 --> 01:10:16,444
Sure.

1553
01:10:20,449 --> 01:10:23,451
I mean, this is only one
of many, many places

1554
01:10:23,453 --> 01:10:25,687
all over Chicago.

1555
01:10:26,622 --> 01:10:28,356
<i>There was a real citywide scare.</i>

1556
01:10:28,358 --> 01:10:30,491
<i>The Chicago police</i>
<i>were being called.</i>

1557
01:10:30,493 --> 01:10:32,760
<i>There were reports in the news.</i>

1558
01:10:32,762 --> 01:10:34,696
<i> Isaiah Thompson</i>
<i>was a local reporter</i>

1559
01:10:34,698 --> 01:10:37,465
<i>who grew up in Chicago</i>
<i>and wrote about the clowns</i>

1560
01:10:37,467 --> 01:10:39,467
<i>that seemed to be lurking</i>
<i>on every corner.</i>

1561
01:10:39,469 --> 01:10:42,237
<i>Somehow-you know,</i>

1562
01:10:42,239 --> 01:10:44,472
<i>I don't know that anyone</i>
<i>knows how, you know,</i>

1563
01:10:44,474 --> 01:10:47,375
<i>this whole city,</i>
<i>especially like this whole</i>

1564
01:10:47,377 --> 01:10:50,211
<i>public school network of</i>
<i>thousands and thousands of kids</i>

1565
01:10:50,213 --> 01:10:51,679
<i>all believe the same thing,</i>

1566
01:10:51,681 --> 01:10:54,482
<i>so it seems like</i>
<i>this larger force of nature</i>

1567
01:10:54,484 --> 01:10:57,986
<i>that sort of visited itself</i>
<i>upon the kids of Chicago.</i>

1568
01:10:57,988 --> 01:11:00,355
<i> What the kids in 1991</i>
<i>didn't know</i>

1569
01:11:00,357 --> 01:11:04,926
<i>was that Chicago had</i>
<i>an even earlier clown scare.</i>

1570
01:11:04,928 --> 01:11:10,898
There was another clown scare
phenomenon previously in 1981.

1571
01:11:10,900 --> 01:11:14,435
It's been said that that one
started in Boston.

1572
01:11:14,437 --> 01:11:16,237
Uh-hm. You think '81,
you think '80s,

1573
01:11:16,239 --> 01:11:19,741
you think Steven king,
you think<i> poltergeist.</i>

1574
01:11:19,743 --> 01:11:23,411
No, that started in '82,
<i>poltergeist,</i> '86 for<i> it.</i>

1575
01:11:23,413 --> 01:11:25,413
This was all before any of that.

1576
01:11:25,415 --> 01:11:27,016
<i> It's easy to see</i>
<i>how poltergeist</i>

1577
01:11:27,017 --> 01:11:29,517
<i>could have helped</i>
<i>spread a clown scare.</i>

1578
01:11:38,494 --> 01:11:40,261
<i>And of course,</i>
<i>Steven king's it...</i>

1579
01:11:40,263 --> 01:11:43,298
Ah-ha, I'll drive you crazy
and I'll kill you all.

1580
01:11:43,300 --> 01:11:45,266
I'm every nightmare
you ever had.

1581
01:11:45,268 --> 01:11:48,670
I am your worst dream come true!

1582
01:11:48,672 --> 01:11:50,371
<i> But the fact</i>
<i>that the 1981 scare</i>

1583
01:11:50,373 --> 01:11:53,708
<i>preceded these cinematic</i>
<i>killer clowns was telling.</i>

1584
01:11:53,710 --> 01:11:56,010
<i>This wasn't just kids</i>
<i>watching some movie,</i>

1585
01:11:56,012 --> 01:11:58,713
<i>not when this fear</i>
<i>was everywhere.</i>

1586
01:11:58,715 --> 01:12:02,784
<i> Clowns appear</i>
<i>in California in 1967;</i>

1587
01:12:02,786 --> 01:12:04,385
<i>in Newark 1980;</i>

1588
01:12:04,387 --> 01:12:05,520
<i>Boston; Providence;</i>

1589
01:12:05,522 --> 01:12:08,389
<i>Omaha; Phoenix,</i>
<i>Arizona in 1985;</i>

1590
01:12:08,391 --> 01:12:09,490
<i>Chicago; Galveston,</i>

1591
01:12:09,492 --> 01:12:10,825
<i>Texas, 1992;</i>

1592
01:12:10,827 --> 01:12:11,893
<i>Washington; Maryland;</i>

1593
01:12:11,895 --> 01:12:13,394
<i>Scotland, 1991;</i>

1594
01:12:13,396 --> 01:12:15,897
throughout a large portion
of Latin America

1595
01:12:15,899 --> 01:12:19,500
from Mexico to South America
in the mid-90s.

1596
01:12:19,502 --> 01:12:21,602
<i>The question of</i>
<i>how it's being spread</i>

1597
01:12:21,604 --> 01:12:24,772
is a very interesting one
because you have an age group

1598
01:12:24,774 --> 01:12:27,942
which doesn't have
an enormous amount of contacts

1599
01:12:27,944 --> 01:12:30,511
<i>and especially</i>
<i>in a pre-Internet time.</i>

1600
01:12:30,513 --> 01:12:33,414
Elementary schools
communicating with students

1601
01:12:33,416 --> 01:12:36,517
in other elementary schools
on the other side of town

1602
01:12:36,519 --> 01:12:36,517
is very unlikely.

1603
01:12:36,519 --> 01:12:41,089
How it's transmitted is really
one of the most intriguing,

1604
01:12:41,091 --> 01:12:44,459
perhaps unsolved mysteries
about it.

1605
01:12:47,792 --> 01:12:49,531
<i>All over the world,</i>

1606
01:12:49,532 --> 01:12:52,533
<i>kids were seeing killer clowns,</i>

1607
01:12:52,535 --> 01:12:54,335
<i>but it could have been</i>
<i>any monster...</i>

1608
01:12:54,337 --> 01:12:58,806
<i>zombies, vampires, witches,</i>
<i>why clowns?</i>

1609
01:12:58,808 --> 01:13:01,676
<i>Maybe our fear points</i>
<i>to an even larger issue.</i>

1610
01:13:01,678 --> 01:13:03,778
<i>Maybe it was the clown's</i>
<i>loss of innocence</i>

1611
01:13:03,780 --> 01:13:06,114
<i>that made them</i>
<i>that much more scary</i>

1612
01:13:06,116 --> 01:13:08,516
<i>because it spoke</i>
<i>to our own loss.</i>

1613
01:13:08,518 --> 01:13:11,686
<i>For those born</i>
<i>into a generation</i>
<i>of stranger danger,</i>

1614
01:13:11,688 --> 01:13:14,389
<i>where missing kids appeared</i>
<i>on every milk carton,</i>

1615
01:13:14,391 --> 01:13:16,391
<i>clowns represented a world</i>

1616
01:13:16,393 --> 01:13:18,526
<i>that had turned</i>
<i>almost evil overnight,</i>

1617
01:13:18,528 --> 01:13:20,795
<i>and that's because</i>
<i>it's here in Chicago</i>

1618
01:13:20,797 --> 01:13:22,697
<i>where the notion</i>
<i>of killer clowns</i>

1619
01:13:22,699 --> 01:13:24,365
<i>became a reality.</i>

1620
01:13:24,367 --> 01:13:25,967
<i> Police found</i>
<i>the decomposed remains</i>

1621
01:13:25,969 --> 01:13:27,168
<i>of three bodies.</i>

1622

<i>They suspect there are several</i>
<i>more bodies buried here.</i>

1623
01:13:29,806 --> 01:13:32,807
<i> And the most</i>
<i>evil of them all was pogo,</i>

1624
01:13:32,809 --> 01:13:36,411
<i>the alter ego of one of the</i>
<i>most prolific serial killers</i>

1625
01:13:36,413 --> 01:13:40,481
<i>in all of history,</i>
<i>John Wayne gacy.</i>

1626
01:13:43,385 --> 01:13:45,453
<i>Gacy was a sadistic</i>
<i>serial killer</i>

1627
01:13:45,455 --> 01:13:47,388
<i>who brutally slayed 33 young men</i>

1628
01:13:47,390 --> 01:13:52,026
<i>between 1972 and 1978</i>
<i>in the Chicago suburbs.</i>

1629
01:13:52,028 --> 01:13:55,797
<i>Though many have portrayed</i>
<i>gacy as an actual killer clown,</i>

1630
01:13:55,799 --> 01:13:57,832
<i>the truth behind</i>
<i>his demented persona</i>

1631
01:13:57,834 --> 01:13:59,634
<i>is not so simple.</i>

1632
01:14:14,416 --> 01:14:16,117
<i>How many bodies</i>
<i>did you find here?</i>

1633
01:14:16,119 --> 01:14:19,053
<i> Twenty-nine,</i>
<i>twenty-seven under the house...</i>

1634
01:14:19,055 --> 01:14:19,053
Uh-hm.

1635
01:14:19,055 --> 01:14:21,989
In the crawlspace,
one under the driveway...

1636
01:14:21,991 --> 01:14:26,461
And one under an extension
that he put on the garage.

1637
01:14:26,463 --> 01:14:26,461
<i>This is Bob egans</i>,

1638
01:14:26,463 --> 01:14:29,864
<i>a former prosecutor</i>
<i>on the gacy case,</i>

1639
01:14:29,866 --> 01:14:32,433
<i>and cook county detective</i>
<i>Jason moran.</i>

1640
01:14:32,435 --> 01:14:34,902
<i> When we first saw</i>
<i>the pogo the clown pictures,</i>

1641
01:14:34,904 --> 01:14:34,902
<i>we went, oh my God,</i>

1642
01:14:34,904 --> 01:14:38,139
<i>is this guy acting as a clown</i>
<i>to get victims...</i>

1643
01:14:38,141 --> 01:14:41,542
that's what we thought,
but it wasn't that at all.

1644
01:14:41,544 --> 01:14:44,178
He was doing that because
he was the center of attention,

1645
01:14:44,180 --> 01:14:44,178
and everything he did

1646
01:14:44,180 --> 01:14:47,114
was to make himself
the center of attention.

1647
01:14:47,116 --> 01:14:49,083
I still don't like clowns.

1648
01:14:49,085 --> 01:14:51,819
And I'm an adult
with a gun and a badge.

1649
01:14:51,821 --> 01:14:53,754
And it might be
from being a child

1650
01:14:53,756 --> 01:14:57,725
during that time because
if you look at pogo the clown,

1651
01:14:57,727 --> 01:14:59,660
he was a very creepy clown.

1652
01:14:59,662 --> 01:15:02,530
If you look at the pictures,
the make-up around his eyes

1653
01:15:02,532 --> 01:15:05,199
when he was portraying pogo,
was triangular,

1654
01:15:05,201 --> 01:15:08,736
and the make-up around his mouth
came up to points.

1655
01:15:08,738 --> 01:15:11,105
<i>Clown experts said</i>
<i>clowns do not have</i>

<i>any sharp points on their faces.</i>

1657
01:15:13,510 --> 01:15:14,809
Why?

1658
01:15:14,811 --> 01:15:17,645
Because it scares kids
and it connotes evil.

1659
01:15:17,647 --> 01:15:20,114
And so do you think
gacy did this on purpose

1660
01:15:20,116 --> 01:15:21,682
to connote evil?

1661
01:15:21,684 --> 01:15:22,783
It was subconscious?
No, I don't think at all.

1662
01:15:22,785 --> 01:15:24,018
I think it was
purely coincidental.

1663
01:15:24,020 --> 01:15:24,018
He wasn't...

1664
01:15:24,020 --> 01:15:24,018
I don't think he was
thinking of that for one second.

1665
01:15:24,020 --> 01:15:28,890
<i>I'm telling you, that's exactly</i>
<i>what we believed at the time.</i>

1666
01:15:28,892 --> 01:15:31,526
Pogo the clown issue
was the subject

1667
01:15:31,528 --> 01:15:34,061
of a lot of conversation
during the trial prep.

1668
01:15:35,564 --> 01:15:38,666
<i> Although gacy never did</i>
<i>kill anyone dressed as a clown,</i>

1669
01:15:38,668 --> 01:15:41,969
<i>he did tell police clowns</i>
<i>could get away with murder,</i>

1670
01:15:41,971 --> 01:15:44,739
<i>leading many to believe</i>
<i>his signature clown look</i>

1671
01:15:44,741 --> 01:15:48,976
<i>was in fact a true reflection</i>
<i>of his inner evil self.</i>

1672
01:15:52,681 --> 01:15:54,882
<i>Ken melvoin-berg</i>
<i>is a noted historian</i>

1673
01:15:54,884 --> 01:15:58,619
<i>who understands</i>
<i>the dark side of a clown.</i>

1674
01:15:58,621 --> 01:16:00,821
It doesn't matter the type
of mask that you're putting on...

1675
01:16:00,823 --> 01:16:02,056
whether it's a clown face...

1676
01:16:02,058 --> 01:16:03,925
it's to hide who you are
a little bit

1677
01:16:03,927 --> 01:16:05,860
and to be somebody
a little bit different.

1678
01:16:05,862 --> 01:16:08,696
It's oftentimes the opposite
of what we portray ourselves

1679
01:16:08,698 --> 01:16:08,696
in our day-to-day lives.

1680
01:16:08,698 --> 01:16:12,800
So somebody who is
a truly evil person like gacy

1681
01:16:12,802 --> 01:16:17,138
puts it on
to sort of offset that.

1682
01:16:17,140 --> 01:16:19,106
<i> What happens</i>
<i>when people costume</i>

1683
01:16:19,108 --> 01:16:23,077
<i>is that they're playing with</i>
<i>these internal personalities...</i>

1684
01:16:23,079 --> 01:16:26,814
<i>they're repressing</i>
<i>the normal ego...</i>

1685
01:16:26,816 --> 01:16:29,984
and they are allowing
some internal personality

1686
01:16:29,986 --> 01:16:32,153
to become dominant.

1687
01:16:32,155 --> 01:16:34,288
And so you put on
the clown make-up

1688
01:16:34,290 --> 01:16:37,558
and you are no longer yourself.

1689
01:16:37,560 --> 01:16:41,963
<i>You then become someone</i>
<i>that is unpredictable,</i>

1690
01:16:41,965 --> 01:16:45,866
possibly dangerous,
possibly violent.

1691
01:16:47,235 --> 01:16:48,302
Game on, my friend.

1692
01:16:51,774 --> 01:16:54,108
Ha-ha-ha-ha.

1693
01:16:55,845 --> 01:16:55,843
<i>Clowns have always been</i>

1694
01:16:55,845 --> 01:16:58,079
<i>a huge thing for us</i>
<i>here in Chicago</i>

1695
01:16:58,081 --> 01:17:00,181
unlike any other American city

1696
01:17:00,183 --> 01:17:03,250
where we have clowns
and clown stories

1697
01:17:03,252 --> 01:17:05,920
and clown mythology
and clown history

1698
01:17:05,922 --> 01:17:09,023
that no other city
in the us has.

1699
01:17:09,025 --> 01:17:12,293
<i>It started off a long time ago</i>
<i>in the 1890s</i>

1700
01:17:12,295 --> 01:17:14,996
<i>when the columbian exposition</i>
<i>brought clowns around</i>

1701
01:17:14,998 --> 01:17:17,365
<i>just to entertain folks.</i>

1702
01:17:17,367 --> 01:17:19,033
<i>Going forward in time</i>
<i>a little bit,</i>

1703
01:17:19,035 --> 01:17:20,935
up into the 1950s, like Bob bell

1704
01:17:20,937 --> 01:17:22,937
who was the original
bozo the clown.

1705
01:17:22,939 --> 01:17:25,840
<i>The bozo set is still at wgn</i>
<i>in the building,</i>

1706
01:17:25,842 --> 01:17:27,274
<i>and it's allegedly haunted.</i>

1707
01:17:27,276 --> 01:17:29,644
In the late '70s is when
you had John Wayne gacy.

1708
01:17:29,646 --> 01:17:31,345
<i>Shortly after is when</i>

1709
01:17:31,347 --> 01:17:31,345
<i>a clown panic happened.</i>

1710
01:17:31,347 --> 01:17:34,915
So for people like me
who are a little bit sadistic,

1711
01:17:34,917 --> 01:17:36,884
to me it's made it
that much more interesting

1712
01:17:36,886 --> 01:17:38,352
because people
are that much more scared

1713
01:17:38,354 --> 01:17:39,987
of clowns these days.

1714
01:17:39,989 --> 01:17:42,390
The thing is
that all of the people

1715
01:17:42,392 --> 01:17:46,761
that were children
in the 1980s and 1990s

1716
01:17:46,763 --> 01:17:46,761
are adults now,

1717
01:17:46,763 --> 01:17:49,830
and are telling these
terrifying tales of clowns

1718
01:17:49,832 --> 01:17:51,232
to their children.

1719
01:17:51,234 --> 01:17:54,001
Speaking of the connection
to clowns in Chicago,

1720
01:17:54,003 --> 01:17:56,370
the one site that you guys
have got to see

1721
01:17:56,372 --> 01:17:59,407
if you haven't been there before
is showmen's rest

1722
01:17:59,409 --> 01:18:04,145
which is a monument
to the circus and clowns

1723
01:18:04,147 --> 01:18:06,180
in a cemetery.

1724
01:18:06,181 --> 01:18:07,181
<i>Buried in Chicago</i>

1725
01:18:07,183 --> 01:18:10,284
<i>were the clowns</i>
<i>and other circus performers</i>

1726
01:18:10,286 --> 01:18:12,153
<i>who died in one of the worst</i>
<i>train wrecks</i>

1727
01:18:12,155 --> 01:18:13,721
<i>in American history.</i>

1728
01:18:13,723 --> 01:18:15,656
<i>On June 22, 1918,</i>

1729
01:18:15,658 --> 01:18:17,958
<i>after its conductor fell asleep,</i>

1730
01:18:17,960 --> 01:18:20,061
<i>a train plowed</i>
<i>into the idle sleeper cars</i>

1731
01:18:20,063 --> 01:18:22,863
<i>of the</i>
<i>hagenbeck-Wallace</i>
<i>circus.</i>

1732
01:18:22,865 --> 01:18:25,032
<i>Those who weren't killed</i>
<i>in the initial impact</i>

1733
01:18:25,034 --> 01:18:28,669
<i>burned to death after</i>
<i>the wooden cars caught on fire.</i>

1734
01:18:30,305 --> 01:18:32,740
<i>In all, 86 performers</i>
<i>were killed.</i>

1735
01:18:32,742 --> 01:18:35,009
<i>With so many burned</i>
<i>beyond recognition,</i>

1736
01:18:35,011 --> 01:18:36,811
<i>they were buried in a mass grave</i>

1737
01:18:36,813 --> 01:18:39,080
<i>in a section</i>
<i>of the Chicago cemetery</i>

1738
01:18:39,082 --> 01:18:41,716
<i>called showmen's rest.</i>

1739
01:18:41,718 --> 01:18:43,951
<i>One of those who survived</i>
<i>was Joe coyle,</i>

1740
01:18:43,953 --> 01:18:45,286
<i>a famously jovial clown</i>

1741
01:18:45,288 --> 01:18:48,089
<i>whose act became</i>
<i>perpetually sad and morose</i>

1742
01:18:48,091 --> 01:18:50,791
<i>as he took to dressing in rags.</i>

1743
01:18:50,793 --> 01:18:54,428
<i>Coyle would play a sad clown</i>
<i>for the rest of his life.</i>

1744
01:18:55,864 --> 01:18:57,198
<i>Joe coyle spoke bitterly</i>

1745
01:18:57,200 --> 01:18:58,733
<i>as he lay on a stretcher</i>

1746
01:18:58,735 --> 01:19:00,468
<i>and told how his wife</i>
<i>and two babies</i>

1747
01:19:00,470 --> 01:19:03,337
had joined him only recently
and how all three

1748
01:19:03,339 --> 01:19:05,940
had been crushed to death
at his very side.

1749
01:19:05,942 --> 01:19:09,009
"The kiddies had been so glad
to see their daddy," he said,

1750
01:19:09,011 --> 01:19:11,812
"I wish I could have died
with them."

1751
01:19:24,192 --> 01:19:26,127
Here, look. See that?

1752
01:19:26,129 --> 01:19:27,129
Baldy.

1753
01:19:27,130 --> 01:19:29,130
Baldy, 1918, June 22.

1754
01:19:29,132 --> 01:19:30,831
They said they
only could name him baldy

1755
01:19:30,833 --> 01:19:33,868
because that was the only name
they knew him by

1756
01:19:33,870 --> 01:19:35,803
was his stage name.

1757
01:19:35,805 --> 01:19:38,239
4 horse driver, 1918.

1758
01:19:38,241 --> 01:19:40,741

01:19:44,413 --> 01:19:45,813
All these graves are unknown.

1761
01:19:45,815 --> 01:19:47,255
All these graves
are unknown.

1762
01:19:48,250 --> 01:19:49,950
<i> Maybe it all started</i>
<i>in Chicago</i>

1763
01:19:49,952 --> 01:19:52,052
<i>with the deaths of these clowns.</i>

1764
01:19:52,054 --> 01:19:54,421
<i>Maybe all it takes</i>
<i>is a little tragedy</i>

1765
01:19:54,423 --> 01:19:57,291
<i>to unlock the even</i>
<i>darker places</i>
<i>in our mind.</i>

1766
01:19:59,861 --> 01:20:01,295
<i>One thing is for certain...</i>

1767
01:20:01,297 --> 01:20:03,998
<i>there's no going back</i>
<i>to the innocent clown.</i>

1768
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,834
<i>The scales have been tipped</i>
<i>and the evidence proves it.</i>

1769
01:20:06,836 --> 01:20:09,870
<i>Clowns can do scary things.</i>

1770
01:20:09,872 --> 01:20:12,206
<i>They can even become killers.</i>

<i>They're saying somebody</i>
<i>is shooting in the auditorium.</i>

1774
01:20:22,351 --> 01:20:24,785
We got seven down
and.

1775
01:20:24,787 --> 01:20:24,785
Seven down.

1776
01:20:24,787 --> 01:20:27,888
I've got a child victim...
I need rescue.

<i> Breaking news</i>

<i>A scene</i>

1779
01:20:35,164 --> 01:20:37,531
<i>A movie theater</i>
<i>where "the dark knight rises"</i>

1780
01:20:37,533 --> 01:20:38,866
<i>was being shown.</i>

1781
01:20:38,868 --> 01:20:41,202
<i>On July 20, 2012,</i>

1782
01:20:41,204 --> 01:20:43,370
<i>James Holmes commits</i>
<i>one of the worse mass shootings</i>

<i>in recent history.</i>

1784
01:20:43,372 --> 01:20:47,007
<i>But if the massacre itself</i>
<i>weren't horrific enough,</i>

1785
01:20:47,009 --> 01:20:50,177
<i>James's costuming</i>
<i>was an ominous testament</i>

1786
01:20:50,179 --> 01:20:54,448
<i>to the allure</i>
<i>of a very specific clown.</i>

1787
01:20:54,450 --> 01:20:56,884
<i>Introduce a little anarchy,</i>

1788
01:20:56,886 --> 01:20:59,153
<i>upset the established order.</i>

I'm an agent of chaos.

1791
01:21:07,930 --> 01:21:09,964
<i> Holmes's embodiment</i>
<i>of the joker,</i>

1792
01:21:09,966 --> 01:21:11,565
<i>a villain</i>
<i>who has come to represent</i>

1793
01:21:11,567 --> 01:21:15,302
<i>the ultimate destruction</i>
<i>of our civilized world</i>

1794
01:21:15,304 --> 01:21:17,004
<i>is no coincidence.</i>

1795
01:21:18,975 --> 01:21:21,976
<i>In our never-ending attempts</i>
<i>to sanitize society,</i>

1796
01:21:23,979 --> 01:21:27,848
<i>we sometimes reap what we sow.</i>

1797
01:21:27,850 --> 01:21:28,983
<i> In a sense,</i>
<i>you can really look at it s</i> as

1798
01:21:28,985 --> 01:21:31,585
a possible backlash.

1799
01:21:31,587 --> 01:21:35,055
He felt this compulsion
to water the clown down

1800
01:21:35,057 --> 01:21:39,159
into this cartoonish,
harmless being,

1801
01:21:39,161 --> 01:21:42,229
<i>and maybe underlying traits</i>
<i>of the archetype</i>

1802
01:21:42,231 --> 01:21:44,398
<i>just came back with a vengeance.</i>

1803
01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:47,635
<i> Holmes's joker-fueled</i>
<i>rampage not only signified</i>

1804
01:21:47,637 --> 01:21:51,038
<i>that the clown's transformation</i>
<i>from innocent to evil</i>

1805
01:21:51,040 --> 01:21:54,041
<i>was finally complete,</i>
<i>but it also revealed</i>

1806
01:21:54,043 --> 01:21:57,978
<i>what was truly lurking</i>
<i>inside of us all.</i>

1807
01:21:57,980 --> 01:22:01,315
We think of ourselves as one,
and in fact we're really

1808
01:22:01,317 --> 01:22:04,985
kind of a parliament
of personalities.

1809
01:22:04,987 --> 01:22:09,890
<i>The killer clown</i>
<i>is one of our personalities,</i>

1810
01:22:09,892 --> 01:22:11,458
<i>it's part of us.</i>

1811
01:22:11,460 --> 01:22:14,428
And so therefore,
we have to be very careful

1812
01:22:14,430 --> 01:22:20,034
not to let the killer clown out
except, in a safe way...

1813
01:22:20,036 --> 01:22:21,635
except in a playful way.

1814
01:22:24,040 --> 01:22:25,572
See, madness as you know,

1815
01:22:25,574 --> 01:22:28,976
is like gravity.

1816
01:22:28,978 --> 01:22:31,412

<i>from these urban legends</i>

1821
01:22:45,962 --> 01:22:49,463
<i>and from the true crimes</i>
<i>that may have inspired them?</i>

1822
01:22:49,465 --> 01:22:53,067
<i>Maybe these monsters,</i>
<i>despite our overwhelming desire</i>

1823
01:22:53,069 --> 01:22:56,937
<i>to believe otherwise,</i>
<i>just aren't real.</i>

1824
01:22:56,939 --> 01:22:58,572
<i>By presenting false boogeymen,</i>

1825
01:22:58,574 --> 01:23:00,174
<i>our urban legends are helping us</i>

1826
01:23:00,176 --> 01:23:03,711
<i>to make sense of crimes</i>
<i>too wicked to comprehend.</i>

1827
01:23:03,713 --> 01:23:06,313
<i> An urban legend,</i>
<i>even though it can be scary,</i>

1828
01:23:06,315 --> 01:23:11,051
<i>it's not nearly as scary</i>
<i>as the actual murderers</i>

1829
01:23:11,053 --> 01:23:13,454
that live in the world with us.

1830
01:23:13,456 --> 01:23:16,190
<i> But peel back the</i>
<i>layers of any campfire tale,</i>

1831
01:23:16,192 --> 01:23:18,359
<i>and you'll understand</i>
<i>the inherent truth</i>

1832
01:23:18,361 --> 01:23:20,661
<i>that despite our need</i>
<i>to believe in an evil,</i>

1833
01:23:20,663 --> 01:23:24,164
<i>in a darker force,</i>
<i>it just isn't true.</i>

1834
01:23:24,166 --> 01:23:26,166
<i>In the end,</i>
<i>the only real boogeyman</i>

1835
01:23:26,168 --> 01:23:28,402
<i>is the one that lurks</i>
<i>inside of us all,</i>

1836
01:23:28,404 --> 01:23:32,506
<i>waiting for just</i>
<i>the right moment to emerge.</i>

1837
01:23:32,508 --> 01:23:35,542
<i>So what's the lesson</i>
<i>behind this cautionary tale?</i>

1838
01:23:35,544 --> 01:23:37,277
<i>The warning here is simple...</i>

1839
01:23:37,279 --> 01:23:40,347
<i>be afraid, not of the story,</i>

1840
01:23:40,349 --> 01:23:42,216
<i>but of the storyteller.</i>
