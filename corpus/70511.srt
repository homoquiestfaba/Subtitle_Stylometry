this list of careers

360
00:16:44,727 --> 00:16:46,718
We're not gonna eat pancakes.

361
00:16:49,207 --> 00:16:51,675
Come on, why are you looking
at me like that?

362
00:16:51,727 --> 00:16:52,921
You thought I forgot?

363
00:16:52,967 --> 00:16:55,845
- I didn't think you forgot.
- I opened a checking account

364
00:16:55,887 --> 00:16:57,559
in your name.

365
00:16:57,607 --> 00:16:58,926
I put $25 in the account

366
00:16:58,967 --> 00:17:00,685
so you can buy
whatever you want.

367
00:17:00,727 --> 00:17:01,955
Don't tell your mother.

368
00:17:02,007 --> 00:17:02,996
I won't.

369
00:17:03,047 --> 00:17:04,082
Thanks, Dad.

370
00:17:04,127 --> 00:17:05,116
Yep.

371
00:17:05,167 --> 00:17:08,079
Didn't that bank turn you down
for a loan, though?

372
00:17:08,127 --> 00:17:09,719
Yes, they all turned me down.

373
00:17:09,767 --> 00:17:11,041
(<i>chuckles</i>)

374
00:17:11,087 --> 00:17:13,237
Then why you opening
a banking account with them?

375
00:17:13,287 --> 00:17:15,437
Well, because one day,
you'll want something

376
00:17:15,487 --> 00:17:17,284
from these people...
a house, a car.

377
00:17:17,327 --> 00:17:20,205
They have all the money.

378
00:17:22,847 --> 00:17:25,600
There's 50 checks there, Frank

379
00:17:25,647 --> 00:17:30,004
which means, from this day on...

380
00:17:30,047 --> 00:17:32,117
you're in their little club.

381
00:17:32,167 --> 00:17:35,477
I'm in their little club.

382
00:17:35,527 --> 00:17:37,518
You got that, you got it all.

383
00:17:37,567 --> 00:17:41,719
It's even got my name there,
huh?

384
00:17:41,767 --> 00:17:43,041
To the moon.

385
00:17:43,087 --> 00:17:47,842
- To the moon!
- To the moon.

See that? It's just a school.

388
00:17:58,647 --> 00:18:00,285
No different than Westbourne.

389
00:18:00,327 --> 00:18:03,956
Ma... you said you were
going to quit.

390
00:18:07,007 --> 00:18:10,317
Frankie, you don't have
to wear the uniform here.

391
00:18:10,367 --> 00:18:13,200
Why don't you take off
your jacket?

392
00:18:13,247 --> 00:18:16,080

Oh, yes?

My name is Mr. Abagnale!

408

That's Abagnale, not Abagnahlee

409

not Abagnaylee, but Abagnale!

410
00:19:09,367 --> 00:19:11,437
Now, somebody please tell me
where you left off

411
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:13,398
in your textbooks.

412
00:19:14,807 --> 00:19:16,445
Excuse me, people,
if I need to ask again

413
00:19:16,487 --> 00:19:18,045
I'm going to write up
the entire class.

Will you please open your

417
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:30,681

Excuse me,

419
00:19:32,167 --> 00:19:33,236
Brad.

00:19:33,287 --> 00:19:36,404
Brad, why don't you get up here
in front of the class here

421
00:19:36,447 --> 00:19:39,484

They said they needed a sub
for Roberta.

I came all the way
from-from Dixon.

429

Well, uh,
I always sub for Roberta.

- (<i>students laughing</i>)

What do they think,
it's easy for a woman my age

435
00:20:12,167 --> 00:20:14,158
and all the money that it costs
to travel?

436
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:15,925
I tell you,
they don't give a damn.

(<i>students laughing</i>)

438
00:20:17,287 --> 00:20:18,640
Mr. And Mrs. Abagnale

439
00:20:18,687 --> 00:20:21,804
this is not a question
of your son's attendance.

440
00:20:21,847 --> 00:20:24,839
I regret to inform you that,
for the past week

441
00:20:24,887 --> 00:20:28,357
Frank has been teaching
Mrs. Glasser's French class.

442
00:20:29,647 --> 00:20:30,875
He what?

443
00:20:30,927 --> 00:20:34,840
Your son has been pretending
to be a substitute teacher

444
00:20:34,887 --> 00:20:39,005
lecturing the students,
uh, giving out homework.

445
00:20:39,047 --> 00:20:42,437
Mrs. Glasser has been ill
and there was

446
00:20:42,487 --> 00:20:45,320
some confusion
with the real sub.

447
00:20:45,367 --> 00:20:48,677
Your son held a teacher-parent
conference yesterday

448
00:20:48,727 --> 00:20:51,036
and was planning
a class field trip

449
00:20:51,087 --> 00:20:53,476
to a French bread factory
in Trenton.

450
00:20:53,527 --> 00:20:56,963
Do you see the problem we have?

451
00:20:57,007 --> 00:20:58,884
- Mrs. Davenport?
- Yeah.

452
00:20:58,927 --> 00:21:01,282
Uh, I have a note to miss fifth
and sixth period today.

453
00:21:01,327 --> 00:21:02,237
Doctor's appointment.

454
00:21:02,287 --> 00:21:04,278
- One moment.

00:21:04,327 --> 00:21:05,555
I'll be right with you.

457
00:21:06,567 --> 00:21:07,477
MRS. DAVENPORT:
Yes?

458
00:21:07,527 --> 00:21:08,676
You should fold it.

00:21:08,727 --> 00:21:09,716
What?

460
00:21:09,767 --> 00:21:11,325
That note. It's a fake, right?

461
00:21:11,367 --> 00:21:12,595
You should fold it.

462
00:21:12,647 --> 00:21:14,319
It's... It's a note from my mom.

463
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:16,005
I have a doctor's appointment.

464
00:21:16,047 --> 00:21:18,766
Yeah, but there's no crease
in the paper.

465

When your mom hands you a note
to miss school

466
00:21:20,807 --> 00:21:22,399
the first thing you do is,
you fold it

467
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:23,800
and you put it in your pocket.

468
00:21:23,847 --> 00:21:26,884
I mean, if it's real,
where's the crease?

I asked her out today.

Oh, Frankie.

00:22:13,407 --> 00:22:15,238
You remember Dad's friend?

00:22:15,287 --> 00:22:17,084
Jack Barnes?

484
00:22:17,127 --> 00:22:18,355
From the club.

485
00:22:18,407 --> 00:22:19,362
Hello.

486
00:22:19,407 --> 00:22:21,238
He came by looking
for your father.

487
00:22:21,287 --> 00:22:23,881
I was giving him
a tour of the apartment.

488
00:22:23,927 --> 00:22:26,839
It's very, uh, uh,
spacious, Paula.

489
00:22:32,167 --> 00:22:34,317
Dad's at the store.

490
00:22:34,367 --> 00:22:37,200
So, Frank...
you're getting to look

491
00:22:37,247 --> 00:22:40,000
more like your old man
every day.

492
00:22:42,567 --> 00:22:44,842
Thanks for the sandwich, Paula.

493
00:22:44,887 --> 00:22:46,605
I'll see you later, eh?

494
00:22:46,647 --> 00:22:48,558
Wait.

495
00:22:52,487 --> 00:22:54,523
Is this yours?

496
00:22:54,567 --> 00:22:57,206
Oh.

497
00:22:57,247 --> 00:22:58,805
Well, thanks, Frank.

00:22:58,847 --> 00:23:01,077
Uh, that's the President's pin.

00:23:01,127 --> 00:23:03,436
I'd be in deep trouble
if I lost that.

Are you hungry, Frankie?

503
00:23:22,527 --> 00:23:24,836
I'll make you a sandwich.

504
00:23:32,647 --> 00:23:35,639
Jack wanted to talk business
with your father.

505
00:23:35,687 --> 00:23:39,475
He thinks we should get a lawyer
and sue the government.

506
00:23:40,967 --> 00:23:43,765
That is not legal,
what they're doing to us.

507
00:23:46,807 --> 00:23:48,718
Why aren't you saying anything?

508
00:23:54,847 --> 00:23:59,284
You're not going to tell him...
are you?

509
00:23:59,327 --> 00:24:00,965
(<i>quietly</i>):
No.

510
00:24:01,007 --> 00:24:02,235
That's right.

511
00:24:02,287 --> 00:24:04,847
There's nothing to tell.

512
00:24:04,887 --> 00:24:06,479
I'm going out for a few hours

513
00:24:06,527 --> 00:24:09,485
to visit some old friends
from the tennis club and...

514
00:24:09,527 --> 00:24:12,997
when I get home,
we'll all have dinner together.

515
00:24:13,047 --> 00:24:14,924
Right?

516
00:24:14,967 --> 00:24:16,878
But you won't say anything

517
00:24:16,927 --> 00:24:20,158
because it's...
it's just silly, isn't it?

518
00:24:20,207 --> 00:24:22,118
How could we sue anybody?

519
00:24:25,927 --> 00:24:30,205
Oh... do you need
some money, Frankie?

520
00:24:30,247 --> 00:24:33,876
A few dollars to buy
some record albums?

521
00:24:33,927 --> 00:24:36,919
Here, take five dollars.

522
00:24:36,967 --> 00:24:38,878
Or-Or ten.

523
00:24:44,167 --> 00:24:46,044

to quit.

00:25:30,087 --> 00:25:32,157
Now, I want you
to leave your things here

536
00:25:32,207 --> 00:25:34,163
and follow me
into the next room, okay?

537
00:25:34,207 --> 00:25:35,686
They're all waiting for you.

538
00:25:38,647 --> 00:25:40,763
PAULA:
You don't have to be scared.

539
00:25:40,807 --> 00:25:42,684
I'm right here, Frank.
I'll always be here.

540
00:25:42,727 --> 00:25:44,365
But there are laws.

541
00:25:44,407 --> 00:25:46,523
Everything in this country has
to be legal.

542
00:25:46,567 --> 00:25:49,400
So what we need to do is
make some decisions.

543
00:25:49,447 --> 00:25:51,005
That's what Mr. Kesner
is here for.

544
00:25:51,047 --> 00:25:53,277
Many times these decisions
are left up to the courts

545
00:25:53,327 --> 00:25:54,726
but that can be
very expensive, Frank

546
00:25:54,767 --> 00:25:56,325

over their children.

547
00:25:56,367 --> 00:25:57,925
Nobody is fighting.

548
00:25:57,967 --> 00:26:00,527

Nobody is fighting.

Do you remember your grandma,
Eve?

554
00:26:10,607 --> 00:26:12,245
She arrived this morning.

(<i>speaks French</i>)

556
00:26:13,687 --> 00:26:15,120
Hello.

557
00:26:23,127 --> 00:26:26,199
Do you understand what
we're saying to you, Frank?

558
00:26:27,767 --> 00:26:31,555
Your father and I
are getting a divorce.

559
00:26:31,607 --> 00:26:33,996
(<i>speaking French</i>)

560
00:26:34,047 --> 00:26:35,162
Nothing's gonna change.

561
00:26:35,207 --> 00:26:36,845
We're still gonna see
each other.

562
00:26:36,887 --> 00:26:38,718
Stop it, please, Frank.
Don't interrupt.

563
00:26:38,767 --> 00:26:40,962
Frank, you don't
have to read all of this.

564
00:26:41,007 --> 00:26:43,999
Most of it's for your parents...
boring adult business...

565
00:26:44,047 --> 00:26:46,686
but this paragraph right here,
this is important

566
00:26:46,727 --> 00:26:49,287
because it states
who you're gonna live with...

567
00:26:49,327 --> 00:26:51,204
after the divorce...

568
00:26:51,247 --> 00:26:53,078
whose custody you will be in.

569
00:26:53,127 --> 00:26:56,119
And there's a blank space
right here.

577
00:27:07,127 --> 00:27:10,676
Frank, just write down a name
and this will all be over.

578
00:27:10,727 --> 00:27:12,558
It's gonna be okay.

579

FRANK:

580
00:27:14,327 --> 00:27:15,396
Your mother or your father.

581
00:27:15,447 --> 00:27:17,483
Just put the name there.
It's as simple as that.

582
00:27:17,527 --> 00:27:20,405
And don't look so scared.

583
00:27:20,447 --> 00:27:22,119
It's not a test.

Carl, when do I get
to call my father?

593
00:27:53,367 --> 00:27:55,801
You can call him

We leave for the airport

Until then, just sit there.

Be quiet.

You know, Carl,

I don't want to hear your story.

605
00:28:20,567 --> 00:28:22,239
This is two checks that bounced.

I'm in?

No, but listen, I'm telling you,

I'll write you another check

to cash checks from other banks.

All right. What does it mean

666
00:31:54,847 --> 00:31:56,360
when one pilot says
to another pilot:

667
00:31:56,407 --> 00:31:57,806
"What kind of equipment
are you on?"

668
00:31:57,847 --> 00:32:00,236
They just want to know what kind
of aircraft you're flying:

Is it a DC-8, 707,
Constellation?

670
00:32:01,647 --> 00:32:04,207
And what about those I.D. Badges
that I've seen pilots wear?

671
00:32:04,247 --> 00:32:06,317
Well, every pilot has to have
two things with him

672
00:32:06,367 --> 00:32:08,403
at all times: One is
his airline personnel badge...

673
00:32:08,447 --> 00:32:10,324
looks just like this one here,
from Pan Am...

674
00:32:10,367 --> 00:32:12,881
the other one is
their FAA license...

675
00:32:12,927 --> 00:32:15,157
and that looks just like this.

Oh, Frank,
you can have that one.

Aw, thanks!
And what about your I.D. Badge?

681
00:32:25,207 --> 00:32:26,606
You have an extra one
I could borrow?

682

Oh, no, I can't help you there.

683
00:32:28,567 --> 00:32:30,398
Those are special-ordered
from Polaroid.

684
00:32:30,447 --> 00:32:31,880
The only way
to get one of those

685

is to become a real live pilot

<i>is a paperhanger</i>

883
00:41:06,767 --> 00:41:08,405
<i>who started working</i>
<i>on the East Coast.</i>

884
00:41:08,447 --> 00:41:10,483
<i>In the last few weeks,</i>
<i>this unsub has developed</i>

885
00:41:10,527 --> 00:41:12,916
<i>a new form of check fraud</i>
<i>which I'm calling "the float."</i>

886
00:41:12,967 --> 00:41:14,002
What he's doing is

887
00:41:14,047 --> 00:41:16,003
he's opening checking accounts
at various banks

888
00:41:16,047 --> 00:41:17,765
then changing the MICR ink
routing numbers

889
00:41:17,807 --> 00:41:19,081
at the bottom of those checks.

890
00:41:19,127 --> 00:41:20,242
Next slide, please.

891
00:41:20,287 --> 00:41:21,436
(<i>projector clanks</i>)

892
00:41:21,487 --> 00:41:23,318
Next slide, please.

893
00:41:23,367 --> 00:41:24,561
Uh, the remote thing is broken.

894
00:41:24,607 --> 00:41:25,722
You'll have to do it by hand.

895
00:41:25,767 --> 00:41:26,756
You've gotta... try the...

896
00:41:26,807 --> 00:41:28,035
FBI Headquarters
Washington, D.C.

897
00:41:28,087 --> 00:41:29,202
Agent Mullen, it should be...

898
00:41:29,247 --> 00:41:31,317
it should be the square button
just there by the side.

899
00:41:31,367 --> 00:41:32,482
This carousel doesn't work.

900
00:41:32,527 --> 00:41:33,880
It's a bad carousel
you got there.

901
00:41:33,927 --> 00:41:34,916
Thank you, Agent Mullen.

902
00:41:34,967 --> 00:41:36,116
Got to move it manually.

903
00:41:36,167 --> 00:41:38,522
This is a map of the 12 banks
of the U.S. Federal Reserve.

904
00:41:38,567 --> 00:41:40,444
Slide.

905
00:41:40,487 --> 00:41:41,522
(<i>clicking</i>)

906
00:41:41,567 --> 00:41:42,966
MICR scanners at every bank

907
00:41:43,007 --> 00:41:45,316
read these numbers
at the bottom of a check...

908
00:41:45,367 --> 00:41:46,516
slide...

909
00:41:46,567 --> 00:41:49,718
and then, ship that check off
to its corresponding branch.

910
00:41:49,767 --> 00:41:52,361
Carl, for those of us who are
unfamiliar with bank fraud

911
00:41:52,407 --> 00:41:54,602
you mind telling us
what the hell

912
00:41:54,647 --> 00:41:56,000
you're talking about?

913
00:41:56,047 --> 00:41:59,801
The East Coast branches are
numbered zero-one to zero-six.

914
00:41:59,847 --> 00:42:01,803
The central branch
is zero-seven, zero-eight

915
00:42:01,847 --> 00:42:02,882
so on, so forth.

916
00:42:02,927 --> 00:42:04,440
You mean those numbers
on the bottom of a check

917
00:42:04,487 --> 00:42:05,522
actually mean something?

918
00:42:05,567 --> 00:42:07,876
All of this was in the report
I filed two days ago.

919
00:42:07,927 --> 00:42:11,886
If you change...
a zero-two to a one-two

920
00:42:11,927 --> 00:42:14,646
that means that check,
which was cashed in New York

921
00:42:14,687 --> 00:42:16,245
does not go
to the New York Federal Branch

922
00:42:16,287 --> 00:42:17,436
but it is rerouted

923
00:42:17,487 --> 00:42:20,604
all the way to the San Francisco
Federal Branch.

924
00:42:20,647 --> 00:42:23,366
The bank doesn't even know the
check has bounced for two weeks

925
00:42:23,407 --> 00:42:25,284
which means our unsub can stay
in one place

926
00:42:25,327 --> 00:42:26,885
paper the same city
over and over again

927
00:42:26,927 --> 00:42:28,406
while his checks circle
the country.

928
00:42:28,447 --> 00:42:31,644
You know,
you want to talk to my wife.

929
00:42:31,687 --> 00:42:34,201
She's the one balances
the checkbook at our house.

930
00:42:34,247 --> 00:42:36,841
(<i>agents laughing</i>)

931
00:42:38,607 --> 00:42:40,962

933
00:42:46,447 --> 00:42:47,675

(<i>chuckling</i>)

935
00:42:50,407 --> 00:42:52,284
My son, the birdman.

936
00:42:52,327 --> 00:42:53,282
Some uniform, Frank.

937
00:42:53,327 --> 00:42:55,204
What do you think?

938
00:42:55,247 --> 00:42:56,805
Nice.

939
00:42:56,847 --> 00:42:58,360
Sit down.

940
00:42:58,407 --> 00:42:59,760
(<i>clears throat</i>)

941
00:43:01,287 --> 00:43:03,323
So, Dad... Daddy, have you
gotten the postcards?

942
00:43:03,367 --> 00:43:04,641
Of course.

943
00:43:04,687 --> 00:43:06,837
This fork is ice cold.

944
00:43:06,887 --> 00:43:10,357
No, no, Dad, th-that's
a chilled salad fork.

945
00:43:10,407 --> 00:43:14,844
(<i>whispering</i>):
It's a fancy restaurant,
you know.

946
00:43:14,887 --> 00:43:18,084
(<i>sighing</i>)

947
00:43:18,127 --> 00:43:20,402
Well, here...

948
00:43:20,447 --> 00:43:22,244
l-I got you something.

949
00:43:22,287 --> 00:43:23,925
What's that?

950
00:43:23,967 --> 00:43:25,878
Open it.

951
00:43:29,727 --> 00:43:31,445
You know what those are, right?

952
00:43:31,487 --> 00:43:33,364
Those are the keys

953
00:43:33,407 --> 00:43:36,240
to a 1965 Cadillac
DeVille convertible.

954
00:43:36,287 --> 00:43:38,084
Brand-new, Dad.

955
00:43:38,127 --> 00:43:40,880
Red with white interior

956
00:43:40,927 --> 00:43:44,886
split seats,
air conditioning, the works.

957
00:43:44,927 --> 00:43:46,121
Are you giving me a Cadillac?

958
00:43:46,167 --> 00:43:47,805
Yeah. I'm giving you a Cadillac.

959
00:43:47,847 --> 00:43:49,485
Dad, sh-she's parked downstairs.

960
00:43:49,527 --> 00:43:50,960
When we're done eating lunch

961
00:43:51,007 --> 00:43:53,760
why don't you, you know,
drive on over to Mom's house

962
00:43:53,807 --> 00:43:55,798
pick her up,
take a little joyride?

963
00:43:55,847 --> 00:43:58,805
Do you know what would happen
if the IRS found out

964
00:43:58,847 --> 00:44:02,157
I was driving around
in a new coupe?

965
00:44:02,207 --> 00:44:04,402
I took the train here, Frank.

966
00:44:04,447 --> 00:44:06,483
I'm taking the train home.

967
00:44:08,287 --> 00:44:10,039
All right.

968
00:44:15,047 --> 00:44:17,959
I have plenty of money.

969
00:44:18,007 --> 00:44:20,282
You know, if you
ever, ever need anything...

970
00:44:20,327 --> 00:44:21,555
You worried?

971
00:44:21,607 --> 00:44:23,723
About me?

972
00:44:23,767 --> 00:44:25,564
No, I'm not... I'm not worried.

973
00:44:25,607 --> 00:44:27,643
You think I can't buy
my own car?

974
00:44:27,687 --> 00:44:32,283
Two mice fell
in a bucket of cream, Frank.

975
00:44:32,327 --> 00:44:34,079
Which one am I?

976
00:44:34,127 --> 00:44:36,687
You're that second mouse.

977
00:44:38,407 --> 00:44:41,877
I went by the store today.

978
00:44:41,927 --> 00:44:43,645
I had to close the store
for awhile.

979
00:44:43,687 --> 00:44:45,086
It's all about timing, Frank.

980
00:44:45,127 --> 00:44:46,799
The goddamn government
knows that.

981
00:44:46,847 --> 00:44:48,360
They hit you when you're down.

982
00:44:48,407 --> 00:44:51,160
I wasn't going to let them
take it from me, so I just...

983
00:44:51,207 --> 00:44:54,005
shut the doors myself,
called their bluff.

984
00:44:58,567 --> 00:45:00,603
Sooner or later,
they'll forget about me.

985
00:45:00,647 --> 00:45:02,956
I understand, I...

986
00:45:03,007 --> 00:45:06,044
Have you told Ma?

987
00:45:07,847 --> 00:45:11,999
She's so stubborn, your mother.

988
00:45:14,687 --> 00:45:15,961
Don't worry.

989
00:45:16,007 --> 00:45:18,237
I'm not going to let her go
without a fight.

990
00:45:18,287 --> 00:45:19,402
I been fighting for us...

Dad?

993
00:45:25,767 --> 00:45:28,201
...since the day we... we met.

994
00:45:28,247 --> 00:45:29,999
Daddy, out of all those men

995
00:45:30,047 --> 00:45:33,323
you were the one that
took her home, remember that.

996
00:45:33,367 --> 00:45:36,643
200 men, sitting in
that tiny social hall

997
00:45:36,687 --> 00:45:38,598
watching her dance.

998
00:45:40,967 --> 00:45:43,322
What was the name of that town?

999
00:45:43,367 --> 00:45:44,595
Montrichard, Dad.

1000
00:45:44,647 --> 00:45:46,046
Yeah.

1001
00:45:46,087 --> 00:45:48,840
I didn't speak a word of French

1002
00:45:48,887 --> 00:45:52,084
and six weeks later,
she was my wi...

1003
00:45:52,127 --> 00:45:54,960
She's your wife.

1004
00:45:55,007 --> 00:45:59,046
My son bought me
a Cadillac today.

1005
00:45:59,087 --> 00:46:02,921
I think that calls for a toast.

1006

To the best damn pilot

1009
00:46:13,447 --> 00:46:15,039
It's not what you think.

1010
00:46:15,087 --> 00:46:17,601
I'm just a copilot.

1011
00:46:17,647 --> 00:46:20,923
You see these people staring
at you?

1012
00:46:24,167 --> 00:46:25,885

and they keep peeking
over their shoulders

wondering where
you're going tonight.

1016
00:46:31,567 --> 00:46:32,966
Where you going, Frank?

1017
00:46:33,007 --> 00:46:36,477
Dad, nobody's staring at me.

1018
00:46:36,527 --> 00:46:38,643
Some place exotic?

People always laugh
at that story.

Let me ask you a question,
Mr. Amdursky.

1039
00:47:29,007 --> 00:47:30,884
If you were having
so much fun undercover

1040
00:47:30,927 --> 00:47:32,599
why did you transfer
to bank fraud?

1041
00:47:32,647 --> 00:47:33,557
I didn't transfer.

1042
00:47:33,607 --> 00:47:35,086
I was censured
and reassigned.

1043
00:47:35,127 --> 00:47:37,402
It's like being punished.
I was punished.

1044
00:47:37,447 --> 00:47:39,324
I screwed up in the field.

1045
00:47:39,367 --> 00:47:40,482
What about you, Mr. Fox?

1046
00:47:40,527 --> 00:47:42,836
Were you... punished
for screwing up in the field?

1047
00:47:42,887 --> 00:47:45,355
Oh, no, no, no, I've never
worked in the field before.

1048
00:47:45,407 --> 00:47:46,999
I audited

00:47:49,127 --> 00:47:50,355
Well, that's just great.

1051
00:47:50,407 --> 00:47:51,635
I ask for a team

1052
00:47:51,687 --> 00:47:53,643

of the Pacific.

1053

You mind if I ask you
a question, Agent Hanratty?

How come you're so serious
all the time?

1055
00:47:58,247 --> 00:48:00,442
Does it bother you,
Mr. Amdursky?

1056
00:48:00,487 --> 00:48:02,955
Yeah. Yeah, it does bother me.

1057
00:48:03,007 --> 00:48:05,362
Does it bother you, Mr. Fox?

A little, I guess.

1059
00:48:06,927 --> 00:48:10,522
Well, would you like
to hear me tell a joke?

1060
00:48:10,567 --> 00:48:14,276
Yeah. Yeah, we'd love
to hear a joke from you.

1061
00:48:14,327 --> 00:48:17,239
Knock, knock.

1062
00:48:17,287 --> 00:48:18,879
Who's there?

1063
00:48:20,927 --> 00:48:23,919
Go fuck yourselves.

<i>He cashed three checks.</i>

1068
00:48:36,287 --> 00:48:37,720
<i>They all cleared.</i>

1069
00:48:37,767 --> 00:48:40,520
<i>I was going to deposit</i>
<i>this one today.</i>

1070
00:48:40,567 --> 00:48:43,479
I don't want any trouble.

1071
00:48:44,927 --> 00:48:46,042
No trouble.

1072
00:48:46,087 --> 00:48:47,156
No trouble at all.

1073
00:48:47,207 --> 00:48:48,925
We'll just take this check
and be on our way.

1074
00:48:48,967 --> 00:48:50,036
Thank you.

1075
00:48:50,087 --> 00:48:51,440
Good.

1076
00:48:51,487 --> 00:48:53,717
Because I don't want
my customers harassed.

1077
00:48:53,767 --> 00:48:55,803
...Each one she passes
goes ahh...

1078

What are you saying,
he's still here?

1080

...Oh, but he watches
so sadly...

1081
00:49:03,047 --> 00:49:04,002
Thank you.

Oh, thanks, son.

...How can he tell her
he loves her...

1085
00:49:08,647 --> 00:49:09,716
Some steps.

1086
00:49:09,767 --> 00:49:11,439
Steps.

1087
00:49:13,927 --> 00:49:15,804
Hey, Mr. Murphy, how are you?

1088
00:49:15,847 --> 00:49:16,916
Is that Frank?

1089
00:49:16,967 --> 00:49:17,877
Yeah, it's Frank.

1090
00:49:17,927 --> 00:49:18,996
Hey, Frank, how are you?

1091
00:49:19,047 --> 00:49:20,116
How's the knee?

1092
00:49:20,167 --> 00:49:21,441

Come on, Carl,
this guy's a pen and ink man.

1097
00:49:27,687 --> 00:49:28,597
A goddamn paperhanger.

1098
00:49:28,647 --> 00:49:29,716
He doesn't even carry a gun.

1099
00:49:29,767 --> 00:49:30,916
Why can't we go with you, Carl?

1100
00:49:30,967 --> 00:49:32,605
You just keep your eyes open,

1101

Oh, that's the new

Put your hands on your head.

You can change the print type

- Just pop out the ball.

I don't know what
you're talking about.

1135
00:50:48,607 --> 00:50:51,599
You think the FBI
are the only ones on this guy?

I mean, come on.

1137

Come on, he's dabbling
in government checks here.

1138
00:50:54,847 --> 00:50:56,803
We've been following
a paper trail on this guy

1139
00:50:56,847 --> 00:50:58,280
for months now.

1140

Look out the window.

1152

My partner's walking him
to the car as we speak... Look.

Old guy almost pissed
in his pants

when I came through the door.

1155
00:51:26,807 --> 00:51:28,525
He jumped
right through the window

1156
00:51:28,567 --> 00:51:29,795
onto the hood of my car.

Hey, Murph?

- Yeah?
- Call the LAPD again.

1159

I don't want people walking
through my crime scene.

I didn't expect
the Secret Service on this.

Don't worry about it.

Well, what's your name?

00:51:50,687 --> 00:51:53,155
Mind if I see
some identification?

1168

Sure.

1169
00:51:54,767 --> 00:51:58,043
You never can be too careful
these days.

1170
00:51:58,087 --> 00:51:59,202
Well, tough luck, Carl.

1171
00:51:59,247 --> 00:52:00,316
Five minutes earlier

1172
00:52:00,367 --> 00:52:02,676
you would've landed yourself
a pretty good collar.

1173
00:52:02,727 --> 00:52:03,842
It's all right.

1174
00:52:03,887 --> 00:52:05,798
Ten seconds later,
and you'd have been shot.

1175
00:52:05,847 --> 00:52:08,042
Mind if I come downstairs
with you?

1176
00:52:08,087 --> 00:52:10,282
L-I got to take a look
at this guy.

1177
00:52:10,327 --> 00:52:11,316
Sure thing.

00:52:11,367 --> 00:52:13,244
Just, uh, do me a favor
and sit tight for a second

while I get
this evidence downstairs.

1180
00:52:14,767 --> 00:52:16,803
You know, I don't want
some maid walking through here

1181
00:52:16,847 --> 00:52:17,757
and making the bed.

1182
00:52:17,807 --> 00:52:18,796
LAPD should be here any sec.

1183
00:52:18,847 --> 00:52:19,802
Wait.

1184
00:52:23,847 --> 00:52:26,077
Your wallet.

1185
00:52:26,127 --> 00:52:27,799
You hang onto it for a minute.

It was stupid.

00:53:36,007 --> 00:53:37,440
I made a stupid mistake.

1200
00:53:37,487 --> 00:53:39,364
Forget about it.

L-I can get this guy, Sean.

1203

The worst thing a paperhanger
can do is show his face.

I read the report.

1205

Six feet tall, brown hair,
27 to 30 years of age

160 pounds.

1207
00:53:50,927 --> 00:53:52,155
This could be almost anybody.

1208
00:53:52,207 --> 00:53:54,357
I heard his voice, Sean,
I saw his face.

1209
00:53:54,407 --> 00:53:56,967
There's nothing for him
to hide behind anymore.

1210
00:53:57,007 --> 00:53:59,362
Just be careful.

1211
00:53:59,407 --> 00:54:00,920
You got 12 years in.

1212
00:54:00,967 --> 00:54:02,719
Nobody bothers you
down on the first floor.

1213
00:54:02,767 --> 00:54:04,644
You practically wrote the book
on bank fraud.

1214
00:54:04,687 --> 00:54:06,120
That's the kind of thing

1215
00:54:06,167 --> 00:54:08,044
that can make you
section chief someday.

1216
00:54:08,087 --> 00:54:11,477
Just don't put yourself
in this type of position.

1217
00:54:11,527 --> 00:54:12,846
What type of position?

1218
00:54:12,887 --> 00:54:17,244
Position of being humiliated.

1219
00:54:24,807 --> 00:54:27,480
Sean, would you like
to hear me tell a joke?

1220
00:54:27,527 --> 00:54:30,325
Yeah, sure.

So, my-my next question is,
when a pilot retires

1223
00:54:38,527 --> 00:54:41,883
uh, Pan Am sends them
a check every single month?

1224
00:54:41,927 --> 00:54:45,636
Uh, yeah, pension program
sends a check and benefits.

1225
00:54:45,687 --> 00:54:47,166
How much is that check for?

1226
00:54:47,207 --> 00:54:49,675
Uh, kid, I'm really not
in the mood for this right now.

1227
00:54:49,727 --> 00:54:51,080
This Skywayman's
driving me crazy.

1228
00:54:51,127 --> 00:54:52,446
Who's the Skywayman?

1229
00:54:52,487 --> 00:54:54,364
Ah, some nut that's flying
around the country

1230
00:54:54,407 --> 00:54:55,556
posing as a Pan Am pilot.

1231
00:54:55,607 --> 00:54:59,316
There's a column about him
in the paper today.

1232
00:55:03,967 --> 00:55:06,435
I keep telling them

01:17:35,607 --> 01:17:36,517
I'm so sorry.

1753
01:17:36,567 --> 01:17:38,046
Please don't be mad at me.

1754
01:17:38,087 --> 01:17:40,123
Please, please,
don't be mad at me.

1755
01:17:40,167 --> 01:17:41,202
No, no.

1756
01:17:41,247 --> 01:17:42,965
Please don't be mad at me.

1757
01:17:43,007 --> 01:17:44,759
Shh. Now... what if...

1758
01:17:44,807 --> 01:17:47,924
what if I spoke
to your parents, right?

1759
01:17:47,967 --> 01:17:49,798
May-Maybe I can
straighten things out, huh?

1760
01:17:49,847 --> 01:17:51,758
Well, I ask them all the time

1761
01:17:51,807 --> 01:17:54,321
but they said I still
can't come home.

1762
01:17:54,367 --> 01:17:58,406
And my daddy's... a lawyer.

1763
01:17:58,447 --> 01:18:00,358
Aw...

1764
01:18:05,407 --> 01:18:08,683
Brenda...

1765
01:18:08,727 --> 01:18:12,037
what if you were engaged
to a doctor?

1766
01:18:12,087 --> 01:18:13,964
Will that change anything?

1767
01:18:14,007 --> 01:18:15,565
What?

1768
01:18:18,727 --> 01:18:22,515
What if I went
to your parents...

1769
01:18:22,567 --> 01:18:24,603
and I spoke to your father...

1770
01:18:27,927 --> 01:18:31,044
and I asked permission
to marry you?

1771
01:18:43,887 --> 01:18:44,797
It's empty.

1772
01:18:44,847 --> 01:18:46,246
Nobody here.

1773
01:19:02,887 --> 01:19:04,764

01:19:08,327 --> 01:19:10,238
(<i>woman laughs</i>)

1776
01:19:10,287 --> 01:19:12,562
Dr. Conners, are you Lutheran?

1777
01:19:12,607 --> 01:19:17,681
Yes, l-I am a Lutheran,
but, please, call me Frank.

1778
01:19:17,727 --> 01:19:20,287
Frank, would you like
to say grace?

1779
01:19:24,887 --> 01:19:28,482
Unless you're not comfortable.

1780
01:19:28,527 --> 01:19:30,438
Absolutely.

1781
01:19:32,127 --> 01:19:34,038
(<i>clears throat</i>)

1782
01:19:39,687 --> 01:19:43,043
Two little mice fell
into a bucket of cream.

1783
01:19:44,647 --> 01:19:46,763
The first mouse quickly
gave up and drowned

1784
01:19:46,807 --> 01:19:48,957
but the second mouse,
he struggled so hard

1785
01:19:49,007 --> 01:19:51,475
that he eventually churned
that cream into butter

1786
01:19:51,527 --> 01:19:53,404
and he walked out.

1787
01:19:53,447 --> 01:19:57,440
- Amen.
- Amen.

1788
01:19:57,487 --> 01:20:00,320
Amen. Oh, that was beautiful.

1789
01:20:00,367 --> 01:20:02,835
The mouse, he churned
that cream into butter.

1790
01:20:02,887 --> 01:20:05,401
(<i>sighing happily</i>)

1791
01:20:05,447 --> 01:20:06,357
That's right.

1792
01:20:06,407 --> 01:20:07,635
That's pretty good.

1793
01:20:07,687 --> 01:20:09,359
Thank you.

1794
01:20:09,407 --> 01:20:11,045
Frank, have you decided
which hospital

1795
01:20:11,087 --> 01:20:12,839
you want to work at
here in New Orleans?

1796
01:20:12,887 --> 01:20:14,957
Well, um, to be quite honest

1797
01:20:15,007 --> 01:20:18,079
I'm thinking
about getting back into law.

1798
01:20:18,127 --> 01:20:19,799
Oh, my!

1799
01:20:19,847 --> 01:20:21,963
Are you a doctor or a lawyer?

1800
01:20:22,007 --> 01:20:26,125
Before I went to medical school,
I passed the bar in California.

1801
01:20:26,167 --> 01:20:27,998
I practiced law for one year

1802
01:20:28,047 --> 01:20:31,244
then I decided why not
try my hand at pediatrics?

1803
01:20:31,287 --> 01:20:33,960
You're just full of surprises.

1804
01:20:34,007 --> 01:20:34,917
Yeah.

1805
01:20:34,967 --> 01:20:37,242
MOTHER (<i>laughing</i>):
Oh, my.

1806
01:20:37,287 --> 01:20:38,242
A doctor and a lawyer.

1807
01:20:38,287 --> 01:20:40,164
Well, I'd say that Brenda
hit the jackpot.

1808
01:20:40,207 --> 01:20:43,040
Where did you go to law school?

1809
01:20:43,087 --> 01:20:44,725
Uh, Berkeley.

1810
01:20:44,767 --> 01:20:45,643
(<i>gasping</i>)

1811
01:20:45,687 --> 01:20:47,006
Berkley, Berkley. Oh, my gosh.

1812
01:20:47,047 --> 01:20:48,526
Isn't that where you went,
Daddy?

1813
01:20:48,567 --> 01:20:50,398
Maybe Frank could come work
for you, Roger.

1814
01:20:50,447 --> 01:20:52,085
You're always saying
how hard it is

1815
01:20:52,127 --> 01:20:53,606
to find
Assistant Prosecutors.

1816
01:20:53,647 --> 01:20:55,717
Could he, Daddy?
Could he, please?

1817
01:20:55,767 --> 01:20:57,200
Could he come work with you,
please?

1818
01:20:57,247 --> 01:20:59,158
Was that snake Hollingsworth
still teaching there

1819
01:20:59,207 --> 01:21:00,401
when you went through Berkley?

1820
01:21:00,447 --> 01:21:02,039
(<i>laughs quietly</i>)

1821
01:21:02,087 --> 01:21:03,520
Hollingsworth.

1822
01:21:03,567 --> 01:21:06,525
Yes. Grumpy old Hollingsworth,
right?

1823
01:21:06,567 --> 01:21:08,080
I tell you. Meaner than ever.

1824
01:21:08,127 --> 01:21:10,038
And that dog of his?

1825
01:21:12,487 --> 01:21:16,560
Tell me, Frank, what was
the name of his little dog?

1826
01:21:24,727 --> 01:21:28,037
I'm sorry. Uh...

1827
01:21:28,087 --> 01:21:29,964
The dog was dead.

1828
01:21:30,007 --> 01:21:31,406
(<i>women cooing</i>)

1829
01:21:31,447 --> 01:21:34,837
How unfortunate.

1830
01:21:34,887 --> 01:21:36,798
Yeah.

1831
01:22:05,847 --> 01:22:08,566
A doctor, a lawyer,
a Lutheran...

1832
01:22:11,167 --> 01:22:14,000
So what are you, Frank?

1833
01:22:14,047 --> 01:22:15,719
'Cause I think you're
about to ask

1834
01:22:15,767 --> 01:22:17,485
for my daughter's hand
in marriage

1835
01:22:17,527 --> 01:22:19,006
and I have a right to know.

1836
01:22:19,047 --> 01:22:21,197
Know what, sir?

1837
01:22:21,247 --> 01:22:23,886
The truth.

1838
01:22:23,927 --> 01:22:28,125
Tell me the truth, Frank.

1839
01:22:28,167 --> 01:22:31,762
What are you doing here?

1840
01:22:31,807 --> 01:22:34,844
What is a man like you doing
with Brenda?

1841
01:22:34,887 --> 01:22:36,878
If you want my blessing

1842
01:22:36,927 --> 01:22:38,963
if you want my daughter

1843
01:22:39,007 --> 01:22:41,885
I'd like to hear it
from you now.

1844
01:22:44,607 --> 01:22:46,518
The truth is, sir, that...

1845
01:22:50,007 --> 01:22:51,486
The truth is that...

1846
01:22:53,687 --> 01:22:56,997
I'm not a doctor,
I'm not a lawyer...

1847
01:22:59,207 --> 01:23:01,801
I'm not an airline pilot.

1848
01:23:01,847 --> 01:23:04,725
I'm... I'm nothing, really.

1849
01:23:10,447 --> 01:23:14,042
I'm-I'm-I'm just a kid who's
in love with your daughter.

1850
01:23:17,167 --> 01:23:19,397
No.

1851
01:23:26,967 --> 01:23:29,197
You know what you are?

1852
01:23:29,247 --> 01:23:31,124
You're a romantic.

1853
01:23:31,167 --> 01:23:34,045
Men like us are nothing
without the women we love.

1854
01:23:34,087 --> 01:23:37,079
I must confess, I'm guilty
of the same foolish whimsy.

1855
01:23:37,127 --> 01:23:39,197
I proposed to Carol
after five dates

1856
01:23:39,247 --> 01:23:42,603
with two nickels in my pockets
and holes in my shoes

1857
01:23:42,647 --> 01:23:44,603
because I knew she was the one.

1858
01:23:44,647 --> 01:23:47,400
So go ahead, Frank.

1859
01:23:50,327 --> 01:23:52,238
Don't be afraid.

1860
01:23:52,287 --> 01:23:55,836
Ask the question you came here
to ask me.

1861

Sir, uh, uh...

1862
01:24:00,167 --> 01:24:01,646
w-what would I have to do

1863
01:24:01,687 --> 01:24:04,155
to take the bar
here in New Orleans?

1865
01:24:08,647 --> 01:24:11,957
No, the... the other question.

Hey, Frank...

1872
01:24:32,287 --> 01:24:34,403
you know what I could
never figure out?

1873
01:24:34,447 --> 01:24:37,041
How did you cheat on the
bar exam in Louisiana?

1874
01:24:37,087 --> 01:24:38,805
Why? What's the difference?

1875
01:24:38,847 --> 01:24:41,077
Someone else took the test
for you, didn't they?

1876
01:24:41,127 --> 01:24:43,766
Carl, I'm going to prison
for a long time.

1877
01:24:43,807 --> 01:24:46,446
Seriously,
what's the difference?

1878
01:24:46,487 --> 01:24:48,637
It's a simple question.

1879
01:24:48,687 --> 01:24:50,996
Are you going to eat
that eclair?

1880
01:24:53,447 --> 01:24:56,962
Yeah. I'm saving it for later.

1881
01:24:57,007 --> 01:24:58,725
Well, you want
to split it with me?

1882
01:24:58,767 --> 01:25:02,157
No.

1883
01:25:02,207 --> 01:25:05,517
Give me half that eclair
and I'll tell you.

1884
01:25:14,687 --> 01:25:18,839
I'm going to figure it out
sooner or later.

1885
01:25:25,127 --> 01:25:28,517
You'll be working under
Phillip Rigby in corporate law.

1886
01:25:28,567 --> 01:25:31,445
Why don't you settle in,
organize your desk?

1887
01:25:33,607 --> 01:25:35,006
Thank you.

1888
01:25:35,047 --> 01:25:37,766
We're having lunch at 12:30
with the Attorney General

1889
01:25:37,807 --> 01:25:39,684
and Governor McKeithen.

01:25:39,727 --> 01:25:40,955
Himself.

1891
01:25:41,007 --> 01:25:42,235
The Governor.

1893
01:25:43,487 --> 01:25:45,000
You sure did.

1894
01:25:45,047 --> 01:25:46,765
Congratulations.

1895
01:25:46,807 --> 01:25:47,922
Thank you, sir.

1896
01:25:47,967 --> 01:25:49,195
Welcome aboard.

1897
01:25:49,247 --> 01:25:51,158
Now...

1898
01:25:55,367 --> 01:25:57,403
Look at this photograph,
Mr. Stewart.

1899
01:25:57,447 --> 01:26:00,484
It's a photograph
of Prentice York

1900
01:26:00,527 --> 01:26:02,483
where they found him, dead.

1901
01:26:02,527 --> 01:26:06,122
Now, here is an enlargement
of part of that photograph.

1902
01:26:06,167 --> 01:26:08,601
This is a photograph
of the defendant's signature

1903
01:26:08,647 --> 01:26:10,046
on a canceled check.

1904
01:26:10,087 --> 01:26:12,476
Now, here is an enlargement
of that same signature

1905
01:26:12,527 --> 01:26:13,642
which matches

1906
01:26:13,687 --> 01:26:16,565
the signature on the letters
that he wrote to Mrs. Simon

1907
01:26:16,607 --> 01:26:18,279
which discuss the possibility

1908
01:26:18,327 --> 01:26:20,522
of defrauding
the great State of Louisiana.

1909
01:26:20,567 --> 01:26:23,718
Your Honor,
ladies and gentlemen of the jury

1910
01:26:23,767 --> 01:26:25,325
this is irrefutable evidence

1911
01:26:25,367 --> 01:26:28,564
that the defendant is,
in fact, lying.

Mr. Conners, this is
a preliminary hearing.

1915
01:26:38,647 --> 01:26:42,037
There is no... defendant.

1916
01:26:42,087 --> 01:26:46,478
There is no... jury.

1917
01:26:46,527 --> 01:26:49,360
It's just me.

1918
01:26:49,407 --> 01:26:50,920
Son...

1919
01:26:50,967 --> 01:26:55,165
what in the hell is wrong
with you?!

1920

- (<i>applause over TV</i>)
- Is that Mitch?

Roger! It's Mitch!

01:26:58,807 --> 01:27:00,320
Oh, my,
I lost all track of time.

01:27:08,887 --> 01:27:11,003
in a few songs for the Irish?
Everybody!

1928
01:27:11,047 --> 01:27:13,561
Has anybody here seen Kelly?

1929
01:27:13,607 --> 01:27:16,405
(<i>all but Frank joining in</i>):
K, E, double L, Y

1930
01:27:16,447 --> 01:27:18,802
Has anybody here seen Kelly?

1931
01:27:18,847 --> 01:27:20,838
Have you seen him smile?

1932
01:27:20,887 --> 01:27:23,321
Sure his hair is red,
and his eyes are blue

1933
01:27:23,367 --> 01:27:25,881
And he's Irish
through and through

1934

Has anybody here seen Kelly

1935
01:27:28,327 --> 01:27:30,682
Kelly from the Emerald Isle?

JUDY GARLAND (<i>on record</i>):
Embrace me

1944
01:27:49,807 --> 01:27:55,040
My sweet embraceable you

1945

Embrace me

1946
01:27:58,167 --> 01:28:04,276
You irreplaceable you

1947
01:28:04,327 --> 01:28:07,239
Just one look at you

1948
01:28:07,287 --> 01:28:13,044
My heart grew tipsy in me

1949
01:28:13,087 --> 01:28:15,806
You and you alone

1950
01:28:15,847 --> 01:28:22,116
Bring out the gypsy in me

1951
01:28:22,367 --> 01:28:25,006

1953
01:28:31,367 --> 01:28:34,120
Above all

1954
01:28:34,167 --> 01:28:37,045
I want my arms about you...

1955
01:28:37,087 --> 01:28:38,759
(<i>whispers</i>):
Dad.

1956
01:28:40,167 --> 01:28:43,284
...Don't be
a naughty baby...

1957
01:28:43,327 --> 01:28:45,283
What are you doing here?

1958
01:28:45,327 --> 01:28:49,479
I... l-I came to see you.

1959
01:28:49,527 --> 01:28:52,439
...My sweet embraceable...

1960
01:28:52,487 --> 01:28:54,557
What are you doing
dressed like this?

1961
01:28:54,607 --> 01:28:56,438
I took a job. A government job.

1962
01:28:56,487 --> 01:28:57,806
You see what I'm doing?

1963
01:28:57,847 --> 01:28:59,485
Do you have a good lawyer?

1964
01:28:59,527 --> 01:29:01,916
Well... I sort of
am a lawyer now.

1965
01:29:01,967 --> 01:29:05,596
Look at this letter.
The IRS wants more.

1966
01:29:05,647 --> 01:29:08,002
I had a deal with them:
Two penalties.

1967
01:29:08,047 --> 01:29:11,278
They ate the cake,
now they want the crumbs.

1968
01:29:11,327 --> 01:29:14,046
I want to sue them.

1969
01:29:14,087 --> 01:29:16,885
Now they want the crumbs.

1970
01:29:16,927 --> 01:29:18,918
They... Here, sit down.

1971
01:29:18,967 --> 01:29:21,481
They're trying to scare me,
intimidate me.

1972
01:29:21,527 --> 01:29:23,961
You know what?

1973
01:29:24,007 --> 01:29:27,283
You know what?
I'll make them chase me...

1974
01:29:27,327 --> 01:29:29,636
for the rest of their lives.

1975
01:29:35,447 --> 01:29:38,962
Hey, it's great
to see you, Daddy.

1976
01:29:39,007 --> 01:29:43,239
Listen, sit down, I...
I want to show you something.

1977
01:29:44,927 --> 01:29:47,157
I came here to give you this.

1978
01:29:47,207 --> 01:29:51,280
It's an invitation
to an engagement party.

1979
01:29:52,327 --> 01:29:55,046
Daddy, I'm getting married.

1980
01:29:55,087 --> 01:29:57,885
Can you believe that?
I'm getting married.

1981
01:29:57,927 --> 01:30:00,361
You don't need to worry
about anything now, Dad.

1982
01:30:00,407 --> 01:30:02,523
Listen, I'm getting
a brand-new Cadillac.

1983
01:30:02,567 --> 01:30:04,285
I'm getting a $60,000 house.

1984
01:30:04,327 --> 01:30:06,204
I'm-I'm getting it all back.

1985
01:30:06,247 --> 01:30:08,636
All-All the jewelry,
all the furs, everything, Dad.

1986
01:30:08,687 --> 01:30:11,281
Everything they took from us,
I'm going to get it back.

1987
01:30:11,327 --> 01:30:13,079
Now...

1988
01:30:13,127 --> 01:30:16,676
has Ma seen you
dressed like this?

1989
01:30:16,727 --> 01:30:20,083
Yeah, she came
to pick up some boxes.

1990
01:30:20,127 --> 01:30:21,685
That's okay, that's okay,
you know why?

1991
01:30:21,727 --> 01:30:23,683
'Cause she... she's going
to the wedding with us.

1992
01:30:23,727 --> 01:30:25,479
I'm going to get you
a brand-new suit, Dad.

1993
01:30:25,527 --> 01:30:26,846
I'm getting you
a brand-new suit.

1994
01:30:26,887 --> 01:30:29,401
One of those Manhattan Eagle,
three-button, black pearl suits.

1995
01:30:29,447 --> 01:30:30,436
You'll look great.

1996
01:30:30,487 --> 01:30:31,840
Those are nice. Yeah.

1997
01:30:31,887 --> 01:30:34,401
She won't see me.

1998
01:30:35,367 --> 01:30:37,164
Well, have you tried
to call her?

1999
01:30:37,207 --> 01:30:39,243
Uh-uh.

2000
01:30:39,287 --> 01:30:41,676
Why don't... why don't you
call her right now?

2001
01:30:41,727 --> 01:30:44,116
Dad, why don't you
call her right now? Here.

2002
01:30:44,167 --> 01:30:46,237
Dad, just call her.
Call her for me.

2003
01:30:46,287 --> 01:30:47,925
You call her, and you tell her

2004
01:30:47,967 --> 01:30:50,561
I have two first-class tickets
to go see her son's wedding...

2005
01:30:50,607 --> 01:30:53,075
Your mother's married now,
to my friend Jack Barnes.

2006
01:30:53,127 --> 01:30:56,358
They have a house
in Long Island.

2007
01:30:56,407 --> 01:30:59,956
(<i>whispering</i>):
I had an FBI agent come see me.

2008
01:31:00,007 --> 01:31:01,759
You got their number, son.

2009
01:31:01,807 --> 01:31:03,798
The guy looked scared.

2010
01:31:03,847 --> 01:31:08,159
The United States government,
champ, running for the hills.

2011
01:31:08,207 --> 01:31:10,357
Pow! To the moon!

2012
01:31:21,087 --> 01:31:23,885
Dad... it's over.

2013
01:31:25,287 --> 01:31:27,164
I'm going to stop now.

2014
01:31:27,207 --> 01:31:29,198
But y-you've...

2015
01:31:29,247 --> 01:31:31,283
They're never going
to catch you, Frank.

2016
01:31:31,327 --> 01:31:33,443
- Dad, she wouldn't do that.
- Why won't you sit down?

2017
01:31:33,487 --> 01:31:35,318
- Why would she do that to you?
- Come on, sit.

2018
01:31:35,367 --> 01:31:36,959
Come on, sit with me.
Have a drink.

2019
01:31:37,007 --> 01:31:38,235
I'm your father.

2020
01:31:38,287 --> 01:31:41,563
Then ask me to stop.

2021
01:31:41,607 --> 01:31:43,723
(<i>quietly</i>):
Then ask me to stop.

2022
01:31:46,527 --> 01:31:48,438
You can't stop.

2023
01:31:50,447 --> 01:31:52,199
Where are you going?

2024
01:31:52,247 --> 01:31:54,522
Come on, Frank,
where are you going?

2025
01:31:54,567 --> 01:31:55,920
Where are you going?

2026
01:31:55,967 --> 01:31:57,844
Where are you going tonight?

2027
01:31:57,887 --> 01:31:59,002
Someplace exotic?

2028
01:31:59,047 --> 01:32:00,275
Where are you going tonight?

2029
01:32:00,327 --> 01:32:01,442
Tahiti, Hawaii?

(<i>phone ringing</i>)

2031
01:32:18,527 --> 01:32:21,325
This is Hanratty.

2032
01:32:21,367 --> 01:32:23,278
FRANK:
Hello, Carl.

2033
01:32:23,327 --> 01:32:25,204
Merry Christmas.

2034
01:32:25,247 --> 01:32:27,522
How are you, Dr. Conners?

2035
01:32:27,567 --> 01:32:31,845
Carl, I haven't been Dr. Conners
for months now.

(<i>Hanratty sniffles,</i>

2037
01:32:33,647 --> 01:32:38,277
Well... I'm sitting here
in my office on Christmas Eve.

2038
01:32:38,327 --> 01:32:39,840

Okay.

2041
01:32:50,847 --> 01:32:52,963
I want it to be over.

2042
01:32:56,047 --> 01:32:58,277
Uh... I want it to be over.

2043
01:32:58,327 --> 01:33:00,124
I'm getting married.

2044
01:33:00,167 --> 01:33:02,078
You know, I'm settling down.

2045
01:33:02,127 --> 01:33:04,004
You've stolen almost $4 million.

2046
01:33:04,047 --> 01:33:06,242
You think we can just
call that a wedding present?

2047
01:33:06,287 --> 01:33:09,165
Nah, this isn't something you
get to walk away from, Frank.

2048
01:33:09,207 --> 01:33:10,640
I want to call a truce.

2049
01:33:10,687 --> 01:33:11,756
No truce.

2050
01:33:11,807 --> 01:33:13,638
You will be caught,
you will go to prison.

2051
01:33:13,687 --> 01:33:15,200
Where did you think
this was going?

2052
01:33:15,247 --> 01:33:18,478
Please leave me alone, Carl.

2053
01:33:18,527 --> 01:33:19,801
Please?

2054
01:33:19,847 --> 01:33:21,599
I'm getting close, aren't I?

2055
01:33:21,647 --> 01:33:23,683
You're scared because
I'm getting close.

2056
01:33:23,727 --> 01:33:26,764
I know you... you rented
that car in Shreveport

2057
01:33:26,807 --> 01:33:29,640
and you stayed in that hotel
on Lake Charles.

2058
01:33:29,687 --> 01:33:31,598
You want to run, be my guest.

2059
01:33:31,647 --> 01:33:33,877
Your checks don't lie
as well as you do.

2060
01:33:33,927 --> 01:33:36,805
Stop chasing me.

2061
01:33:38,927 --> 01:33:41,487
I can't stop.

2062
01:33:41,527 --> 01:33:43,916
It's my job.

2063
01:33:43,967 --> 01:33:46,356
It's okay, Carl.

2064
01:33:46,407 --> 01:33:49,683
I just thought I'd ask,
you know?

2065
01:33:52,007 --> 01:33:55,920
Hey. Merry Christmas, huh?

All right... (<i>clears throat</i>)

Let's get every newspaper

every newspaper in Louisiana
for the last two months.

2071

What are we looking for?

2072
01:34:08,207 --> 01:34:10,437
Engagement announcements,
name of Conners.

2073
01:34:10,487 --> 01:34:12,717
Conners?! Come on, Carl,
the kid would've

2074
01:34:12,767 --> 01:34:14,200
changed his name by now.

2075
01:34:14,247 --> 01:34:16,886
Mm-mm. He can't change it.

2076
01:34:16,927 --> 01:34:18,724
She thinks he's Conners.

2077
01:34:18,767 --> 01:34:20,883
If he loses the name,
he loses the girl.

2078
01:34:20,927 --> 01:34:22,440
I can't give you anything

2079

But love, baby

- Keep dancing, huh?

All those things

Oh, me too. Thank you.

01:35:12,527 --> 01:35:13,880
Right over there, sir.

2100
01:35:13,927 --> 01:35:16,361
- Hi, Roger. How are you?
- Hi, Vin.

2101
01:35:16,407 --> 01:35:18,637
Good evening, gentlemen.
I'm Roger Strong.

2102
01:35:18,687 --> 01:35:20,120
Carl Hanratty, FBI.

2103
01:35:20,167 --> 01:35:22,237
This is Agents Amdursky and Fox.

2104
01:35:22,287 --> 01:35:24,323
Sorry to crash your party, sir.

2105
01:35:24,367 --> 01:35:26,198
Not at all.
What can I do for you?

2106
01:35:26,247 --> 01:35:29,478
If it's not too much trouble,
I'd like to meet the groom.

2107
01:35:29,527 --> 01:35:32,360
Is there a problem?

2108
01:35:32,407 --> 01:35:34,079
- (<i>laughter</i>)
- Frank! Frank!

2109
01:35:34,127 --> 01:35:35,162
Can you hold all these?

2110
01:35:35,207 --> 01:35:36,720
(<i>whispering</i>):
Yeah. Come here.

2111
01:35:36,767 --> 01:35:38,962
They're checks.
They're from my dad's friends.

2112
01:35:39,007 --> 01:35:41,157
They're for us, so we can
start a new life... Hey!

2113
01:35:41,207 --> 01:35:42,720
What are you doing?
What's wrong?

2114
01:35:42,767 --> 01:35:44,405
We have to leave.

2115
01:35:44,447 --> 01:35:46,165
What?!

2116
01:35:46,207 --> 01:35:48,084
Brenda, you love me, right?

2117
01:35:48,127 --> 01:35:49,526
Yes.

2118
01:35:49,567 --> 01:35:51,125
I mean, you'd love me
no matter what.

2119
01:35:51,167 --> 01:35:52,077
Yes.

2120
01:35:52,127 --> 01:35:53,037
I mean, you'd love me

2121
01:35:53,087 --> 01:35:54,566
whether I was sick
or whether I was poor

2122
01:35:54,607 --> 01:35:55,881
or even if I had
a different name.

2123
01:35:55,927 --> 01:35:57,326
Frank, where'd you get
all that money?

2124
01:35:57,367 --> 01:35:58,561
Brenda, listen. A name, right?

2125
01:35:58,607 --> 01:35:59,801
A name, it doesn't matter.

2126
01:35:59,847 --> 01:36:01,360
My name is Frank Conners, right?

2127
01:36:01,407 --> 01:36:02,601
- That's who I am with you.
- Yes.

2128
01:36:02,647 --> 01:36:03,841
But-but we all have secrets.

2129
01:36:03,887 --> 01:36:05,240
You know,
sometimes when I travel

2130
01:36:05,287 --> 01:36:07,482
I use the name Frank Taylor.
That-That's my secret.

2131
01:36:07,527 --> 01:36:09,404
- Frank Taylor?!
- Yeah, Frank Taylor, you know?

2132
01:36:09,447 --> 01:36:10,596
- Frank Black.
- Frank Black?!

2133
01:36:10,647 --> 01:36:11,716
Yeah, it doesn't matter.

2134
01:36:11,767 --> 01:36:14,361
Why are you saying all this?

2135
01:36:14,407 --> 01:36:17,001
Brenda... Brenda, I don't want
to lie to you anymore.

2136
01:36:17,047 --> 01:36:18,446
All right? I'm not a doctor.

2137
01:36:18,487 --> 01:36:20,159
I never went to medical school.

2138
01:36:20,207 --> 01:36:22,801
I'm not a lawyer or a Harvard
graduate or a Lutheran.

2139
01:36:22,847 --> 01:36:25,281
Brenda, I ran away from home
a year and a half ago

2140
01:36:25,327 --> 01:36:27,079
when I was 16.

2141
01:36:27,127 --> 01:36:29,766
Frank...

2142
01:36:29,807 --> 01:36:31,957
Frank?

2143
01:36:32,007 --> 01:36:33,884
You're not a Lutheran?

2144
01:36:33,927 --> 01:36:36,282
Brenda... you see
all this money?

2145
01:36:36,327 --> 01:36:38,238
You see all this money?
I have more.

2146
01:36:38,287 --> 01:36:40,755
I have plenty more.

2147
01:36:40,807 --> 01:36:41,762
I have enough money

2148
01:36:41,807 --> 01:36:43,604
to last us
for the rest of our lives

2149
01:36:43,647 --> 01:36:45,046
- (<i>gasps</i>)
- Look.

2150
01:36:45,087 --> 01:36:47,601
Frank, stop teasing me.

2151
01:36:47,647 --> 01:36:48,875
You're Frank Conners.

2152
01:36:48,927 --> 01:36:51,839
You're Frank Conners,
and you're 28 years old and...

2153
01:36:51,887 --> 01:36:53,115
(<i>whispering</i>):
Brenda...

2154
01:36:53,167 --> 01:36:55,078
Why would you lie to me?

2155
01:36:55,127 --> 01:36:57,243
- Brenda, Brenda...
- I want to know your name.

2156
01:36:57,287 --> 01:36:59,278
- Listen to me, Brenda.
- Tell me your name.

2157
01:36:59,327 --> 01:37:00,601
We can live anywhere we want

2158
01:37:00,647 --> 01:37:02,160
but you have to trust me,
Brenda.

2159
01:37:02,207 --> 01:37:03,435
- Do you trust me?
- Yes.

2160
01:37:03,487 --> 01:37:05,443
- Do you love me, Brenda?
- Yes.

2161
01:37:05,487 --> 01:37:06,806
- You love me?
- I love you.

2162
01:37:06,847 --> 01:37:09,281
Excuse me, Mother.

2163
01:37:09,327 --> 01:37:11,602
Honey, this is Mr. Hanratty.
My wife Carol.

2164
01:37:11,647 --> 01:37:13,126
- Oh, Mister...?
- Hanratty, ma'am.

2165
01:37:13,167 --> 01:37:14,282
- Ratty.
- Yes.

2166
01:37:14,327 --> 01:37:15,999
Have you seen Frank or Brenda?

2167
01:37:16,047 --> 01:37:18,038
L-I think they went upstairs.

2168
01:37:23,367 --> 01:37:24,925
Frank...

2169
01:37:26,567 --> 01:37:28,398
(<i>whispers</i>):
Brenda, come here.

2170
01:37:28,447 --> 01:37:30,403
Okay, in two days,
you're going to meet me

2171
01:37:30,447 --> 01:37:32,438
at Miami International
Airport, all right?

2172
01:37:32,487 --> 01:37:34,955
You're going to leave the house
after your parents go to sleep.

2173
01:37:35,007 --> 01:37:36,122
You're going to take a taxicab.

2174
01:37:36,167 --> 01:37:37,839
You give the taxi driver
this money right here

2175
01:37:37,887 --> 01:37:39,639
and you tell him to drive
all through the night.

2176
01:37:39,687 --> 01:37:41,439
Brenda, you're going
to leave at 10:00am.

2177
01:37:41,487 --> 01:37:43,205
- 10:00am, all right?
- But...

2178
01:37:43,247 --> 01:37:45,442
(<i>scatting</i>)

2179
01:37:45,487 --> 01:37:47,603
I never stop

2180
01:37:47,647 --> 01:37:50,639
Till I get to the top...

2181
01:37:50,687 --> 01:37:53,804
(<i>jazz continues in distance</i>)

2182
01:38:01,487 --> 01:38:02,966
Which room, sir?

2183
01:38:03,007 --> 01:38:04,281
In the corner.

2184
01:38:04,327 --> 01:38:05,555
You have to listen to me,
all right?

2185
01:38:05,607 --> 01:38:07,518
The International Terminal
in Miami, all right? Say it.

2186
01:38:07,567 --> 01:38:09,000
Okay, the International
Terminal in Miami.

2187
01:38:09,047 --> 01:38:10,366
- No matter what...
- No matter what...

2188
01:38:10,407 --> 01:38:12,284
- You're going to take a taxicab.
- I will take a taxi.

2189
01:38:12,327 --> 01:38:13,806
You're going to be there
at 10:00am.

2190
01:38:13,847 --> 01:38:15,041
I will be there at 10:00am,
no matter what.

2191
01:38:15,087 --> 01:38:15,997
- In two days.
- Two days.

2192
01:38:16,047 --> 01:38:16,957
Two days, Brenda. Two days.

2193
01:38:17,007 --> 01:38:18,440
In two days, I'll be there

2194
01:38:18,487 --> 01:38:20,045
no matter what, at 10:00am.

2195
01:38:26,607 --> 01:38:28,040
You're not going
to tell anyone, Brenda.

2196
01:38:28,087 --> 01:38:29,156
You have to promise me, now.

2197
01:38:29,207 --> 01:38:30,526
(<i>crying</i>):
Frank, please!

2198
01:38:30,567 --> 01:38:32,762
Before you go,
please tell me your name.

2199
01:38:32,807 --> 01:38:35,037
Please, tell me.

2200
01:38:35,087 --> 01:38:39,524
Frank William Abagnale Jr.

Your attention...

01:40:42,687 --> 01:40:45,520
(<i>sighing</i>)

2215
01:40:45,567 --> 01:40:48,320
Brenda.

2216
01:40:57,607 --> 01:40:59,484
AMDURSKY:
<i>This guy's a no-show.</i>

2217
01:40:59,527 --> 01:41:00,846
<i>He must've got wise to us.</i>

2218
01:41:00,887 --> 01:41:02,366
HANRATTY:
<i>Maybe he was tipped.</i>

2219
01:41:02,407 --> 01:41:04,045
If he's not here today,
he'll be tomorrow.

2220
01:41:04,087 --> 01:41:05,805
We'll get him before
he leaves the country.

2221
01:41:05,847 --> 01:41:07,166
He doesn't have a passport.

2222
01:41:07,207 --> 01:41:09,516
For the last six months, he's
gone to Harvard and Berkeley.

2223
01:41:09,567 --> 01:41:10,920
I'm betting he can get
a passport.

2224
01:41:10,967 --> 01:41:12,685
So we have all our men
waiting for him here

2225
01:41:12,727 --> 01:41:13,637
in Miami International.

2226
01:41:13,687 --> 01:41:15,325
He's used it before.
He knows the layout.

2227
01:41:15,367 --> 01:41:17,164
I talked to Miami police;
they've offered us

2228
01:41:17,207 --> 01:41:18,799
50 uniformed cops
in two shifts of 25.

2229
01:41:18,847 --> 01:41:20,883
With our guys, that's almost
100 men in one airport.

2230
01:41:20,927 --> 01:41:22,645
Don't you think
we should spread it around?

2231
01:41:22,687 --> 01:41:24,245
No, no, this is the exit point.

2232
01:41:24,287 --> 01:41:26,403
Well, how do you know
he hasn't rented a car

2233
01:41:26,447 --> 01:41:28,563
and driven to airports
in New York, Atlanta?

2234
01:41:28,607 --> 01:41:30,040
Because I'm not in New York.

2235
01:41:30,087 --> 01:41:31,281
I'm not in Atlanta.

2236
01:41:31,327 --> 01:41:33,124
Yes, this is, uh, Frank Roberts

2237
01:41:33,167 --> 01:41:35,123
and I'm letting
all the universities

2238
01:41:35,167 --> 01:41:37,886
in the area know
that Pan Am will be initiating

2239
01:41:37,927 --> 01:41:39,883
a new recruiting program
this year.

2240
01:41:39,927 --> 01:41:43,044
I'II, uh, be stopping
by your campus tomorrow morning.

2241
01:41:43,087 --> 01:41:45,999
Thank you all very much
for coming.

2242
01:41:46,047 --> 01:41:47,162
At the end of the day

2243
01:41:47,207 --> 01:41:50,199
I'll be choosing eight
young ladies to be a part of...

2244

(<i>cheering and laughter</i>)

2245
01:41:51,807 --> 01:41:54,480
...Pan Am's future stewardess
flight crew program.

2246
01:41:54,527 --> 01:41:56,995
Now, these eight young ladies
will accompany me

2247
01:41:57,047 --> 01:41:59,959
on a two-month public relations
tour through Europe.

2248
01:42:00,007 --> 01:42:01,235
(<i>women squealing</i>)

2249
01:42:01,287 --> 01:42:03,847
They will discover firsthand
what it takes

2250
01:42:03,887 --> 01:42:05,878
to be a Pan American stewardess.

2251
01:42:05,927 --> 01:42:07,679
(<i>cheering</i>)

2252
01:42:07,727 --> 01:42:10,161
HANRATTY:
Give me at least two men...

2253
01:42:10,207 --> 01:42:12,675
Nah, one man
per every two counters.

2254
01:42:12,727 --> 01:42:14,001
- Mm-hmm.
- All right?

2255
01:42:14,047 --> 01:42:15,480
Amdursky?

2256
01:42:15,527 --> 01:42:17,404
Yeah?

2257
01:42:17,447 --> 01:42:19,483
Make sure your uniforms
are covering

2258
01:42:19,527 --> 01:42:21,404
the sidewalk entrances
and exits.

2259
01:42:21,447 --> 01:42:24,757
Hey... let's have, uh, periodic
sweeps of the men's lav.

2260
01:42:24,807 --> 01:42:27,116
You, here.

2261
01:42:27,167 --> 01:42:30,796
What qualifies me
to be a future stewardess?

2262
01:42:30,847 --> 01:42:33,281
Well, I think
that I'm really friendly

2263
01:42:33,327 --> 01:42:34,965
and I can really help out

2264
01:42:35,007 --> 01:42:38,522
and, um, make people
feel welcome on the plane and...

2265
01:42:38,567 --> 01:42:40,956
We'll be traveling
at 6,000 miles per hour

2266
01:42:41,007 --> 01:42:42,599

If you can use
some exotic booze

01:43:25,367 --> 01:43:28,723
There's a bar in far Bombay

Come fly with me,

In Ilama land
there's a one-man band

And he'll toot his flute

Once I get you up there...

2292
01:44:11,607 --> 01:44:13,006
You see that blonde out front?

2293
01:44:13,047 --> 01:44:14,116
I should have been a pilot.

2294
01:44:14,167 --> 01:44:15,885
Exactly.

AMDURSKY:
Carl, your walkie-talkie
wasn't working.

2299
01:44:22,007 --> 01:44:23,360
There's a guy
in a Pan Am uniform

2300
01:44:23,407 --> 01:44:25,967
sitting in a white Coupe DeVille
out in front of Terminal J.

2301
01:44:26,007 --> 01:44:27,076
That's the charter terminal.

2302
01:44:27,127 --> 01:44:28,321
Can you get a look at his face?

2303
01:44:28,367 --> 01:44:29,482
He's got his pilot's cap on.

2304
01:44:29,527 --> 01:44:30,676
Carl, I think it's him!

2305
01:44:30,727 --> 01:44:32,843
...Just say the words,
and we'll beat the birds

01:44:46,687 --> 01:44:48,678
Step out of the car!

2315
01:44:48,727 --> 01:44:50,922
Keep your hands
where I can see 'em.

2316
01:44:50,967 --> 01:44:52,605
Don't shoot me!
I'm just a driver.

2317
01:44:52,647 --> 01:44:54,638
A man paid me $100
to wear this uniform

2318
01:44:54,687 --> 01:44:55,756
and pick someone up
at the airport.

2319
01:44:55,807 --> 01:44:56,762
Who you picking up?

2320
01:44:57,727 --> 01:44:58,876
Hey!

2321
01:45:02,327 --> 01:45:07,321
Pack up, let's fly away.

HANRATTY:
South America, Australia

2325
01:45:23,567 --> 01:45:24,477
Singapore, Egypt.

2326
01:45:24,527 --> 01:45:26,279
The kid's gone
completely out of control.

2327
01:45:26,327 --> 01:45:27,396
Why wasn't I called?

2328
01:45:27,447 --> 01:45:28,846
FOX:
Nobody was called, sir.

2329
01:45:28,887 --> 01:45:31,765
The banks didn't know what
was happening till last week.

2330
01:45:31,807 --> 01:45:32,922
That's impossible.

2331
01:45:32,967 --> 01:45:34,639
They didn't call
'cause it's not counterfeiting.

2332
01:45:34,687 --> 01:45:36,200
- It's something else.
- Well, what is he doing?

2333
01:45:36,247 --> 01:45:37,316
He's making real checks, sir.

2334
01:45:37,367 --> 01:45:38,277
These are so perfect

2335
01:45:38,327 --> 01:45:39,840
the airline didn't know
the difference.

2336
01:45:39,887 --> 01:45:41,559
Last check was cashed
in Madrid a week ago.

2337
01:45:41,607 --> 01:45:42,722
My guess is he's still there.

2338
01:45:42,767 --> 01:45:44,041
We have to leave now, sir.
Today.

2339
01:45:44,087 --> 01:45:45,315
Go where?

2340
01:45:45,367 --> 01:45:46,925
Spain? You want to go to Spain?

2341
01:45:46,967 --> 01:45:48,286
Well, eventually,
he's got to go back

2342
01:45:48,327 --> 01:45:49,476
to where the checks
were printed.

2343
01:45:49,527 --> 01:45:51,404
I think that's why
he's moving back through Europe.

2344
01:45:51,447 --> 01:45:53,039
Look at the map, sir.
He's making a circle.

2345
01:45:53,087 --> 01:45:54,076
He's running out of checks.

2346
01:45:54,127 --> 01:45:55,480
I know it's a...
it's a long shot, sir

2347
01:45:55,527 --> 01:45:57,882
but if we track him from Madrid,
sir, we could still catch him.

2348
01:45:57,927 --> 01:45:59,645
I'm sorry, Carl,
if you couldn't catch him here

2349
01:45:59,687 --> 01:46:01,006
you're not going
to catch him there.

2350
01:46:01,047 --> 01:46:02,844
But, sir, we're going
to let him get away.

2351
01:46:02,887 --> 01:46:06,323
No, Carl, you let him get away.

Hmm!

2355
01:46:52,567 --> 01:46:55,206
Color separation is flawless.

2356
01:46:57,367 --> 01:46:59,403
There's no bleeding. Hmm.

2357
01:46:59,447 --> 01:47:01,961
Nobody does work like this
in the States.

2358
01:47:02,007 --> 01:47:03,235
Nobody but us.

Where was it printed?

2360
01:47:05,047 --> 01:47:07,197
(<i>chuckling</i>):
It was printed on a monster...

2361

A monster.

...a dinosaur, four colors.

2365
01:47:12,407 --> 01:47:13,840
You can smell the weight.

2366
01:47:13,887 --> 01:47:15,400
Two tons, without the ink.

(<i>inhales, clears throat</i>)

2368
01:47:16,847 --> 01:47:18,803
Where do they do printing
like this?

2369
01:47:18,847 --> 01:47:20,405
Germany, Great Britain...

2370
01:47:20,447 --> 01:47:21,357
France.

BOTH PRINTERS:
France!

2372
01:47:24,087 --> 01:47:26,157
France. Frank's mother said
the name of a village in France

2373
01:47:26,207 --> 01:47:27,322
where they didn't have Sara Lee.

2374
01:47:27,367 --> 01:47:28,846
The village where
she met Frank's father.

2375
01:47:28,887 --> 01:47:30,240
Oh, yeah,
I don't remember, uh...

2376
01:47:30,287 --> 01:47:32,118
It started with an M.
It was, uh, "Mont" something.

2377
01:47:32,167 --> 01:47:33,077
"Mont." Mr. Fox?

2378
01:47:33,127 --> 01:47:34,037
Uh, yes, yes.

Question: "You met your husband
during the war?"

2380

Answer: "Yes, I lived
in a small village in France.

2381

Yeah, right.

2382
01:47:38,927 --> 01:47:41,157
"The kind of place where
they never heard of Sara Lee."

Tell me you wrote down the name
of the village, Mr. Fox.

Put your shirt on, Frank.
You're under arrest.

Hey, are you hungry?
Do you want some beans, Carl?

2405

They got the best
French beans here.

Carl, I gotta tell you,
they're delicious.

You want a bite?

2411
01:49:02,847 --> 01:49:04,280
But they needed the help
of an American.

Are you hungry?
You want a bite?

2413
01:49:05,527 --> 01:49:07,085
But I told them
I wouldn't bring them to you

2414
01:49:07,127 --> 01:49:08,719
unless I could put the cuffs
on you myself.

No gun.

All right, all right.

Well, there's no windows here.

I'm going to take a look
out the front door.

No! No!

2428
01:49:29,047 --> 01:49:31,641
I told them I'd walk out first
and give a signal.

2429
01:49:31,687 --> 01:49:33,040
Here, you can
put these on yourself.

No, I can't do that!

Tell me what you want me to see,

2442
01:49:54,807 --> 01:49:55,762
I wouldn't lie to you.

Look, you're wearing
a wedding ring.

2444

You're wearing
a wedding ring, Carl!

2445

You lied to me about that!

2446

Didn't you lie about that?!

2447
01:50:01,287 --> 01:50:02,879

you pay some hotel desk clerk

2457
01:50:21,727 --> 01:50:23,763
to make that call for you,
is that what you did?

2458
01:50:23,807 --> 01:50:24,717
It was Captain Luc.

2459
01:50:24,767 --> 01:50:25,882
I've got one minute
to bring you out.

2460
01:50:25,927 --> 01:50:27,246
Captain Luc? Captain Luc!

2461
01:50:27,287 --> 01:50:28,197
Ooh, Captain Luc.

2463

that-that sounds
pretty official to me

2464

I think it's just

it's me and you.

2466
01:50:34,967 --> 01:50:36,320

You have to trust me on this!

2473

I told you this was
what was going to happen

2474
01:50:47,487 --> 01:50:49,159
that there was no other way
for it to end.

2475
01:50:49,207 --> 01:50:51,846
Don't make a mistake!

2476
01:50:51,887 --> 01:50:53,002
That's good.

2477
01:50:53,047 --> 01:50:55,242
That's good, Carl, you know?

2478
01:50:55,287 --> 01:50:56,197

Well... I don't know.

She lives with her mother

You got any of the checks?

2663
02:00:09,527 --> 02:00:12,041

Say again?

2665
02:00:13,407 --> 02:00:14,920
L-It's definitely a teller,
Carl.

for the dates, see.

2668
02:00:18,447 --> 02:00:20,085
They get used
over and over again

2669
02:00:20,127 --> 02:00:21,446
so they always get worn out

2670
02:00:21,487 --> 02:00:23,284
and the numbers
are always cracking.

2671
02:00:23,327 --> 02:00:26,922
The sixes and the nines...
see, they go first.

2672

2680
02:00:50,247 --> 02:00:51,362
You haven't looked at it.

2681
02:00:51,407 --> 02:00:53,796
Well, there's
no perforated edge, right?

2682
02:00:53,847 --> 02:00:56,725
I mean, this... this check
was hand-cut, not fed.

Yeah...

Paper is double-bonded

2685
02:01:00,167 --> 02:01:02,397

to be a bank check.

And this doesn't smell
like MICR.

It's some kind of a...

2691
02:01:11,167 --> 02:01:12,839
you know,
some kind of a drafting ink.

2692
02:01:12,887 --> 02:01:15,037

Frank, we have the power
to take you out of prison.

Tomorrow is Saturday.

You go back to Europe, you're

I know that.

02:05:55,887 --> 02:05:58,242
I spent four years trying
to arrange your release.

of the United States

2762
02:06:02,247 --> 02:06:03,157
you wouldn't run.

2763
02:06:03,207 --> 02:06:05,960
Why'd you do it?

2764
02:06:06,007 --> 02:06:07,360
You're just a kid.

2765
02:06:07,407 --> 02:06:09,125
I'm not your kid.

You're lying.

She was four when I left.

Now she's 15.

02:06:20,887 --> 02:06:23,924
My wife's been remarried

02:06:58,367 --> 02:07:01,120
to Pittsburgh
is now ready for boarding.

2788
02:07:01,167 --> 02:07:05,763
Passengers with boarding passes,
please proceed to Gate 23A.

2789
02:07:12,647 --> 02:07:14,239
Okay.

2790
02:07:14,287 --> 02:07:16,437
Alice, has he still not called?

2791
02:07:16,487 --> 02:07:18,398
No, he hasn't.

2792
02:07:27,967 --> 02:07:30,527
HANRATTY:
<i>Good morning.</i>

2793
02:07:30,567 --> 02:07:32,523
I've, uh, called this meeting
to discuss

2794
02:07:32,567 --> 02:07:34,762
a new type of check fraud
and counterfeiting

2795
02:07:34,807 --> 02:07:37,116
which the unsub is washing
and altering checks

2796
02:07:37,167 --> 02:07:39,044
then passing them
throughout Arizona.

2797
02:07:39,087 --> 02:07:43,046
(<i>panting</i>)

2798
02:07:43,087 --> 02:07:44,566
This unsub is a big dog

2799
02:07:44,607 --> 02:07:46,677
passing checks
as large as five figures.

2800
02:07:46,727 --> 02:07:48,445
(<i>door opening</i>)

2801
02:07:49,887 --> 02:07:52,720
Sorry I'm late.

2802
02:07:52,767 --> 02:07:54,678
Sorry.

2803
02:07:58,207 --> 02:08:01,483
We have a recovered check
on Agent Reiter's desk.

2804
02:08:01,527 --> 02:08:03,438
Why don't we step out
to the bullpen?

2805
02:08:07,607 --> 02:08:11,361
There's impressions
on every line.

2806
02:08:11,407 --> 02:08:15,002
Looks like the original amount
was for $60.

2807
02:08:18,567 --> 02:08:19,761
Mind if I take a look?

2808
02:08:23,127 --> 02:08:26,005
Cashed in Flagstaff a week ago.

2809
02:08:27,767 --> 02:08:30,565
Cost the bank $16,000.

2810
02:08:30,607 --> 02:08:32,484
It's a real check.

2811
02:08:32,527 --> 02:08:34,438
Yeah.

2812
02:08:34,487 --> 02:08:35,636
Yeah. It's been washed.

2813
02:08:35,687 --> 02:08:37,564
The only thing original
is the signature.

2814
02:08:37,607 --> 02:08:39,359
But it's perfect, Carl.
I mean...

2815
02:08:39,407 --> 02:08:41,602
I mean, this isn't hydrochloride
or bleach.

2816
02:08:41,647 --> 02:08:43,842
No.

2817
02:08:43,887 --> 02:08:45,525
Something new.

2818
02:08:45,567 --> 02:08:47,523
Maybe a nail polish remover
where the acetone

2819
02:08:47,567 --> 02:08:49,444
removes the ink
that's not been printed?

2820
02:08:53,327 --> 02:08:56,160
How did you do it, Frank?

2821
02:08:56,207 --> 02:08:59,085
How did you cheat
on the bar exam in Louisiana?

2822
02:09:04,287 --> 02:09:07,359
I didn't cheat.

2823
02:09:07,407 --> 02:09:10,877
I studied for two weeks
and I passed.

2824
02:09:11,927 --> 02:09:14,122
Is that the truth, Frank?

2825
02:09:14,167 --> 02:09:16,317
Is that the truth?

2826
02:09:16,367 --> 02:09:18,756
I'll bet this guy steals checks
out of mailboxes.

2827
02:09:18,807 --> 02:09:21,241
He washes off their names
and he puts on his own.

2828
02:09:23,007 --> 02:09:25,157
You're saying that he's a local?

2829
02:09:25,207 --> 02:09:26,435
Well, if it were me, you know

2830
02:09:26,487 --> 02:09:28,682
I'd call the bank first,
I'd check out the balance...

2831
02:09:28,727 --> 02:09:30,285
Make sure there's enough money
in there

2832
02:09:30,327 --> 02:09:31,476
to make it worth your while.

2833
02:09:31,527 --> 02:09:32,596
Exactly.

2834
02:09:32,647 --> 02:09:34,558
You know, Carl, I think
this guy's pretty smart.

2835
02:09:34,607 --> 02:09:36,165
I guess all we have to do now
is catch him.

2836
02:09:36,207 --> 02:09:37,640
We'll start first thing
in the morning.

2837
02:09:37,687 --> 02:09:39,120
We'll run the name
Eric Anthony Feeders.

2838
02:09:39,167 --> 02:09:40,316
In Nevada, Arizona, California.

2839
02:09:40,367 --> 02:09:42,198
Frank Abagnale, Jr. Has
been married for 26 years.

2840
02:09:42,247 --> 02:09:44,363
He has three sons and lives
a quiet life in the midwest.

2841
02:09:44,407 --> 02:09:47,001
Since his release
from prison in 1974,

2842
02:09:47,047 --> 02:09:51,598
Frank has helped the FBI capture
some of the world's most elusive

2843
02:09:51,647 --> 02:09:53,797
check forgers
and counterfeiters

2844
02:09:53,847 --> 02:09:57,840
and is considered one of the
world's foremost authorities

2845
02:09:57,887 --> 02:09:59,718
on bank fraud and forgery.

2846
02:09:59,767 --> 02:10:03,396
Frank has also designed many
of the secure checks

2847
02:10:03,447 --> 02:10:07,281
that banks and Fortune 500
companies use every day.

2848
02:10:08,287 --> 02:10:10,118
For his services,
these companies pay

2849
02:10:10,167 --> 02:10:12,601
Frank Abagnale, Jr.
Millions of dollars a year.

2850
02:10:13,687 --> 02:10:18,602
Frank and Carl remain close
friends to this day.

2851
02:14:51,767 --> 02:14:54,645
