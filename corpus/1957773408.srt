Hello, Crowley games division.

111
00:04:21,053 --> 00:04:22,313
How may we help you?

112
00:04:22,513 --> 00:04:24,515
Hi. Uh... look, I was just playing

113
00:04:24,848 --> 00:04:29,395
"Tai Chi Gut Buster,"
the new one, level 120,

114
00:04:29,728 --> 00:04:32,773
which is the Qing Dynasty.

115
00:04:33,107 --> 00:04:35,943
And my opponent, Cam Chi... it's weird,

116
00:04:36,277 --> 00:04:38,696
he used a drunken monkey move.

117
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:40,840
Yeah, that's a difference
of, like, 2,000 years.

118
00:04:40,864 --> 00:04:41,499
I don't know if you know that.

119
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:44,034
Our games are designed by
top martial arts experts,

120
00:04:44,368 --> 00:04:46,745
there's no way a mistake like
that could have been made.

121
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:50,040
Oh, well, um, it did happen.

122
00:04:50,374 --> 00:04:51,967
It was made.

123
00:04:52,167 --> 00:04:54,795
Sir, why don't you
just play the game again?

124
00:04:55,129 --> 00:04:57,881
What's wrong with you people?

125
00:04:58,215 --> 00:05:00,135
Look, you know, I'm trying
to be nice about this,

126
00:05:00,384 --> 00:05:02,136
but I'm trying to help you with your game.

127
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:04,680
You know, I know a lot
about these subjects.

128
00:05:05,014 --> 00:05:06,574
[Employee] Well, thank you very much.

129
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:08,660
You know, I've noticed this
is your third complaint

130
00:05:08,684 --> 00:05:10,277
this month, Mr. Singleton.

131
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:11,237
So?

132
00:05:11,437 --> 00:05:13,188
Just noting it for our files.

133
00:05:13,522 --> 00:05:14,822
Is that all?

134
00:05:16,025 --> 00:05:18,485
Uh, no, um, one other thing.

135
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:20,696

(sultry saxophone music)

141
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:38,797
Come on, Will, take a
break from that for a while.

142
00:05:39,131 --> 00:05:43,427
I saw you working out and
it made me so... you know.

143
00:05:43,761 --> 00:05:44,854
So what?

144
00:05:45,054 --> 00:05:46,730
[Woman] So horny.

145
00:05:49,725 --> 00:05:51,193
Nah, I can't.

146
00:05:51,894 --> 00:05:56,565
I gotta take care of Cam Chi
and his drunken monkey move.

147
00:05:58,901 --> 00:06:02,363
You don't even have time
for something really quick?

148
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:03,996
Quick, hmm?

149
00:06:06,158 --> 00:06:08,160
Nah, I don't think so.

150
00:06:10,621 --> 00:06:12,790
Well, I mean, with you,
it's never a quickie.

151
00:06:13,123 --> 00:06:16,919
It's just sometimes, you
make me want you so bad.

152
00:06:27,596 --> 00:06:30,849
You're the only man that can satisfy me.

153
00:06:38,065 --> 00:06:40,901
Oh, Will, I want you all to myself.

154
00:06:43,695 --> 00:06:47,282
You're the only man that can satisfy me.

174
00:07:52,598 --> 00:07:55,601
Tory, I thought you weren't
coming home until tomorrow.

175
00:07:55,934 --> 00:07:56,944
Well, I'm back.

176
00:07:57,144 --> 00:07:57,778
Why do you use that thing?

177
00:07:57,978 --> 00:07:59,938
You know how much it disgusts me.

178
00:08:00,272 --> 00:08:02,191
But I don't use it when you're here.

179
00:08:02,524 --> 00:08:04,204
(scoffs) What a perfect emotional match.

180
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:05,703
You can handle her, she doesn't talk back.

181
00:08:05,903 --> 00:08:08,405
Look, Tory, I want you.

182

You're real.

to feed my little boy impulses.

185
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:15,421
Delete the program.

186
00:08:15,621 --> 00:08:18,040
(scoffs) Delete the program?

187
00:08:18,373 --> 00:08:20,417
Yeah, delete the program.

188
00:08:25,088 --> 00:08:26,388
That's it.

189
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:29,384
Your favorite software is now deleted.

190
00:08:29,718 --> 00:08:32,179
[Reporter] Pan German
financier Herr Heinz Dietrich

191
00:08:32,513 --> 00:08:34,306
and American mogul R.D. Crowley

192
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,150
signed an historic agreement today,

193
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:37,943
finalizing the long awaited merger

194
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:39,895
between the world's two largest companies.

195
00:08:40,229 --> 00:08:41,989
You know, Crowley is
such a fucking genius.

196
00:08:42,064 --> 00:08:44,191
You should have seen the
place he put us up in.

197
00:08:44,525 --> 00:08:45,326
It reeked of money.

198
00:08:45,526 --> 00:08:47,152
You ever not think about work?

199
00:08:47,486 --> 00:08:49,086
Well, maybe I would if I had your job.

200
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,698
That is so fucked up,
Tory, and you know it.

201
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:54,451
My job is perfectly fine until
I figure out what I wanna do.

202
00:08:54,785 --> 00:08:56,003
And when is that gonna be?

203
00:08:56,203 --> 00:08:57,421
I don't know.

204
00:08:57,621 --> 00:08:58,505
You keep asking me that

205
00:08:58,705 --> 00:08:59,548
and I keep telling you, I don't know.

206
00:08:59,748 --> 00:09:01,091
Look, I'm sorry.

207
00:09:01,917 --> 00:09:06,838
I just... I just feel like I
missed my calling or something.

208
00:09:07,464 --> 00:09:08,984
I know that sounds really lame to you.

209
00:09:09,216 --> 00:09:10,392
Maybe it's time for more vid therapy.

210
00:09:10,592 --> 00:09:12,719
She was really helpful
last time, wasn't she?

211
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:13,771
I guess.

212
00:09:13,971 --> 00:09:14,605
Yeah, and didn't she say

213
00:09:14,805 --> 00:09:17,307
you should turn your obsession
with history into...?

214
00:09:17,641 --> 00:09:18,359
Fixation.

215
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:20,978
No, she called it an obsession.

216
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:22,196
Whatever.

217
00:09:22,396 --> 00:09:24,189
Can't you turn that into a website job?

218
00:09:24,523 --> 00:09:27,568
Yeah, except nobody
cares about history today.

219
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:30,779
All right, fine, then just give up.

220
00:09:32,364 --> 00:09:35,200
Look, I've got a score to settle.

221
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:39,797
(computer beeps)

222
00:09:39,997 --> 00:09:41,873

(computer beeping)

225
00:09:48,171 --> 00:09:49,881
Mika, I'm trying not...

226
00:09:52,634 --> 00:09:54,186
(foot thudding)

227
00:09:54,386 --> 00:09:55,354

(man groans)

231
00:10:01,685 --> 00:10:03,437
Will, come on!

232
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:05,322
Please, kill him now, Will!

233
00:10:05,522 --> 00:10:06,949

(Thor groaning)

246
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:29,805
(bones cracking)

247
00:10:30,005 --> 00:10:31,757
[Computer] Illegal move, illegal move.

248
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:33,884
Forfeit match, forfeit.

249
00:10:34,217 --> 00:10:36,053
- Sorry.
- Illegal move.

250
00:10:36,386 --> 00:10:37,187
Illegal move.

251
00:10:37,387 --> 00:10:39,556
Match forfeit, match forfeit.

252
00:10:41,642 --> 00:10:43,977
If he can use the drunken
monkey move, so can I.

253
00:10:44,311 --> 00:10:46,772
(ominous music)

254

(door bangs)

259
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:22,015
I can't die.

260
00:11:22,349 --> 00:11:23,358
Let's go, Christy.

261
00:11:23,558 --> 00:11:25,185
[Christy] Please, I'm an innocent man.

262
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:26,445
[Will] It's time.

263
00:11:26,645 --> 00:11:27,905
Come my, son.

264
00:11:28,105 --> 00:11:30,190
Let Jesus into your heart

265
00:11:30,524 --> 00:11:32,192
and the Kingdom of Heaven is yours.

266
00:11:32,526 --> 00:11:34,152
Get me the fuck out of here.

267
00:11:34,486 --> 00:11:36,363
It's not even for real.

268
00:11:36,697 --> 00:11:37,498
(door bangs)

269
00:11:37,698 --> 00:11:39,291
[Will] Come on.

270
00:11:39,491 --> 00:11:40,918
It's time to go now.

271
00:11:41,118 --> 00:11:43,203
I'm going to die for no reason.

272
00:11:43,537 --> 00:11:45,789
You can't let that happen.
- Look, you were given

273
00:11:46,123 --> 00:11:49,376
a fair trial, you were found guilty.

274
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:50,802
It wasn't a fair trial.

275
00:11:51,002 --> 00:11:54,464
Christy, you killed and ate your wife!

276
00:11:54,798 --> 00:11:58,009
They found parts of her in your stomach!

277
00:11:58,343 --> 00:12:00,095
It's time to pay the bill, Christy!

278
00:12:00,429 --> 00:12:02,222
I was framed, I swear.

279
00:12:02,556 --> 00:12:03,815
(door bangs)

280
00:12:04,015 --> 00:12:05,608
Come on, get up.

281
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:10,188
Don't make this harder than it has to be.

282
00:12:10,522 --> 00:12:12,274

Bye, bye!

00:13:01,364 --> 00:13:02,665
This is it.

299
00:13:04,326 --> 00:13:06,411
[Christy] Painless, right?

300
00:13:06,745 --> 00:13:09,498
They flood your body with poisons.

301
00:13:09,831 --> 00:13:11,583
You'll expire without even knowing it.

302
00:13:11,917 --> 00:13:14,836
And when I walk through
the door, it starts?

303
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:16,470
[Will] Yeah.

304
00:13:17,172 --> 00:13:18,472
Well...

305
00:13:20,717 --> 00:13:22,427
guess I found a way out.

You can't go offline any time you want.

312
00:13:59,089 --> 00:14:00,641
The trick to virtual reality

313
00:14:00,841 --> 00:14:03,385
is keeping it as real as possible.

314
00:14:03,718 --> 00:14:06,847
Look, I need to
downlink, all right, man?

315
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:08,482
I owe you one.

316
00:14:08,682 --> 00:14:10,892
Will Singleton owes me one.

317
00:14:13,144 --> 00:14:14,445

Yeah.

336
00:15:48,865 --> 00:15:50,165
Okay, R.

340
00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:01,426
Okay.

341
00:16:02,212 --> 00:16:05,715
Why do you two play this fucking game?

342
00:16:06,049 --> 00:16:07,889
Gotta do something to
keep the brain working.

343
00:16:08,093 --> 00:16:09,102
You wanna know the rules?

344
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:11,262
No, I don't wanna
know the fucking rules.

345
00:16:11,596 --> 00:16:12,606
It's called Ghost.

346
00:16:12,806 --> 00:16:14,316
We each take turns saying a letter.

347
00:16:14,516 --> 00:16:16,267
The key is to not finish spelling a word.

348
00:16:16,601 --> 00:16:18,979
- Shut up!
- But you can't pick any word.

349
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:21,064
You know? You can't just say anything.

350
00:16:21,398 --> 00:16:22,282
You can't throw out any letter

351
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:24,859
and make up a word like "goobergobber."

352
00:16:25,193 --> 00:16:26,453
You got that, Martin?

353
00:16:26,653 --> 00:16:28,162
Yeah, I got it.

354
00:16:32,283 --> 00:16:33,794
I.

355
00:16:33,994 --> 00:16:35,294
E.

356
00:16:37,789 --> 00:16:38,840
E?

357
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,300
No way E.

358
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,800
E.

359
00:16:42,585 --> 00:16:43,845
Challenge.

360
00:16:44,045 --> 00:16:44,679
"Harrier."

361
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:47,173
Small dog used for hunting rabbits.

362
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:50,468
I should know, I used to have one.

363
00:16:50,802 --> 00:16:53,013
You used to hunt rabbits?

364
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:54,189
I was born and raised

365
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:57,642
on one of the last working farms in Iowa.

366
00:16:57,976 --> 00:17:01,855
Absolutely the most
beautiful place in the world.

367
00:17:03,064 --> 00:17:04,449
It's gone now.

368
00:17:06,776 --> 00:17:08,370
What word were you looking for?

369
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:10,246
Oh, uh, "harridan."

370
00:17:11,031 --> 00:17:12,332
Scolding old woman.

371
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:15,910
[Stu] (chuckles) Why?
You have one of those?

372
00:17:16,244 --> 00:17:17,871
I have a girlfriend.

373
00:17:19,456 --> 00:17:22,917
She does get on my case
every now and then.

374
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:25,595
(door bangs)

375
00:17:25,795 --> 00:17:27,839
No, I don't have a woman.

376
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:30,967
Just a little brother.

377
00:17:32,343 --> 00:17:34,387
Well, uh, I don't mean to be rude,

378
00:17:34,721 --> 00:17:36,514
but it's late, I gotta run.

379
00:17:36,848 --> 00:17:37,482
[Stu] What, are you crazy?

380
00:17:37,682 --> 00:17:39,442
You can do no wrong.

381
00:17:41,853 --> 00:17:45,440
You shouldn't be talking
to those fucking pricks.

382
00:17:45,774 --> 00:17:49,235
He'll split your head
open first chance he gets.

383
00:17:49,569 --> 00:17:54,240
(machine beeping)
(Christy groaning)

384
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:57,035
(liquid bubbling)

385
00:17:57,368 --> 00:17:59,954
(Christy screaming)

386
00:18:00,288 --> 00:18:02,916
(liquid whirring)

387
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:07,712
(liquid dripping)

388
00:18:08,046 --> 00:18:10,381
(saw buzzing)

389
00:18:10,715 --> 00:18:13,343
(liquid dripping)

390
00:18:14,344 --> 00:18:17,305
(flesh tearing)

391
00:18:17,639 --> 00:18:19,140
Dual bypass.

392
00:18:19,474 --> 00:18:20,108
Check.

393
00:18:20,308 --> 00:18:21,935
Cerebellum connection.

394
00:18:22,268 --> 00:18:23,568
Check.

395
00:18:24,062 --> 00:18:25,939
Hey, moving nicely.

396
00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:27,073
This could be a new record.

397
00:18:27,273 --> 00:18:28,283
You are timing this, right?

398
00:18:28,483 --> 00:18:29,576
Oh, yeah.

399
00:18:29,776 --> 00:18:32,654
All right, start up Subcon Shareware.

400
00:18:32,987 --> 00:18:34,497
(computer whirring)

401
00:18:34,697 --> 00:18:35,749
Right.

402
00:18:35,949 --> 00:18:38,034
Okay, message going in.

403
00:18:38,368 --> 00:18:39,753
And message coming back.

404
00:18:39,953 --> 00:18:40,587
Okay, good.

405
00:18:40,787 --> 00:18:42,130
Chip insertion.

406
00:18:42,831 --> 00:18:44,916
Cerebral cortex interface.

407
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:46,635
(computer beeps)

408
00:18:46,835 --> 00:18:48,261
We should have visual.

409
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:49,721
- He does.
- Good.

410
00:18:49,921 --> 00:18:51,097
Is he interacting?

411
00:18:51,297 --> 00:18:52,641
Yeah, he is.

412
00:18:52,841 --> 00:18:54,184
Okay, great.

413
00:18:54,384 --> 00:18:55,684
Time?

414
00:18:57,011 --> 00:18:58,229
34 seconds.

415
00:18:58,429 --> 00:18:59,564
Fantastic loading.

416
00:18:59,764 --> 00:19:00,565
Thank you.

417
00:19:00,765 --> 00:19:01,858
Okay, close him up

418
00:19:02,058 --> 00:19:03,318
and let's try to break 30 on the next one.

419
00:19:03,518 --> 00:19:08,314
(suspenseful music)
(birds chirping)

420
00:19:14,529 --> 00:19:17,198
(sword clanging)

421
00:19:23,204 --> 00:19:24,505
(gun clicking)

422
00:19:28,126 --> 00:19:29,752
(gun clicking)

423
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:54,861
(Christy panting)

424
00:19:55,195 --> 00:19:58,281
(water splashing)

425
00:19:58,615 --> 00:20:01,242
(water splashing)

426
00:20:04,621 --> 00:20:07,373
(Christy panting)

427
00:20:24,224 --> 00:20:25,233
(Christy screaming)

428
00:20:25,433 --> 00:20:26,943
(gun bangs)

429
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:32,065
(birds chirping)

430
00:20:32,398 --> 00:20:33,033
(machine beeping)

431
00:20:33,233 --> 00:20:35,777
(man chattering)

432
00:20:47,205 --> 00:20:47,964
(air hissing)

433
00:20:48,164 --> 00:20:50,708
(man chattering)

434
00:20:51,834 --> 00:20:54,504
(man chattering)

435
00:21:01,094 --> 00:21:04,931
(ominous music)
(water dripping)

436
00:21:05,265 --> 00:21:07,475
(door bangs)

437
00:21:13,147 --> 00:21:15,483
(door bangs)

438
00:21:16,609 --> 00:21:18,236
Please let it be Heaven.

439
00:21:18,569 --> 00:21:20,571
I've done some things that
should put me in Hell,

440
00:21:20,905 --> 00:21:22,040
but I've also done a lot of things

441
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,249
that should put me with Him.

442
00:21:23,449 --> 00:21:25,493
Go with the grace of God.

443
00:21:35,586 --> 00:21:38,214
(doors rumbling)

444
00:21:49,309 --> 00:21:51,978
(doors rumbling)

445
00:21:53,313 --> 00:21:54,489
(guns firing)
(suspenseful music)

446
00:21:54,689 --> 00:21:57,400
(group chattering)

447
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:04,157
(gun firing)

448
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:05,750
(guns firing)

449
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:07,493
What the fuck is going on?

450
00:22:07,827 --> 00:22:09,129
We're in the hole,
man, they're everywhere!

451
00:22:09,329 --> 00:22:10,380
They're fucking everywhere, man!

452
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:11,880
I don't know.

453
00:22:13,374 --> 00:22:15,835
(guns firing)

454
00:22:18,671 --> 00:22:21,132
(gun firing)

455
00:22:21,466 --> 00:22:23,760
(gun firing)

456
00:22:25,136 --> 00:22:27,555
(gun firing)

457
00:22:29,307 --> 00:22:31,726
(gun firing)

458
00:22:34,562 --> 00:22:36,981
(gun firing)

459
00:22:41,736 --> 00:22:44,155
(gun firing)

460
00:22:48,701 --> 00:22:50,578
(gun clicks)

461
00:22:50,912 --> 00:22:52,872
Motherfucker, you wanna get spanked?

462
00:22:53,206 --> 00:22:55,875
I'll spank you, motherfucker!

463
00:22:56,209 --> 00:22:59,837
Yeah, you fuck!

464
00:23:00,171 --> 00:23:02,131
Come on, yeah!

465
00:23:03,674 --> 00:23:04,975
Motherfucker!

466
00:23:06,552 --> 00:23:07,478
Come on!

467
00:23:07,678 --> 00:23:12,475
That's right, come on,
motherfucker! (screaming)

468
00:23:13,935 --> 00:23:15,561
Yeah, goddammit!

469
00:23:15,895 --> 00:23:17,897
Come at me, motherfuckers!

470
00:23:18,231 --> 00:23:19,616
Come on!

471
00:23:19,816 --> 00:23:21,326
Come on, you fucks!

472
00:23:21,526 --> 00:23:23,403
Goddammit, motherfucker!

473
00:23:23,736 --> 00:23:25,036
Shit!

474
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:34,122
What the fuck are you doing here?

475
00:23:34,455 --> 00:23:36,749
(gun firing)

476
00:23:42,839 --> 00:23:44,182
Sit down, Will.

477
00:23:44,382 --> 00:23:46,058
This will be quick.

478
00:23:46,717 --> 00:23:48,719
Mr. Crowley and I have a few things

479
00:23:49,053 --> 00:23:51,347
we'd like to discuss with you.

480
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:56,269
Good day, Mr. Singleton.

481
00:23:56,602 --> 00:24:01,065
I regret that I'm not able
to speak with you in person.

482
00:24:01,399 --> 00:24:02,492
I understand, sir.

483
00:24:02,692 --> 00:24:04,628
Let's get right to it, Mr.
Crowley has a schedule to keep.

484
00:24:04,652 --> 00:24:09,198
Will, we have a problem with
your interaction behavior.

485
00:24:09,532 --> 00:24:10,416
How so?

486
00:24:10,616 --> 00:24:11,959
Uh, allow me.

487
00:24:13,703 --> 00:24:16,831
You see, Will, I designed
this virtual prison

488
00:24:17,165 --> 00:24:19,125
as a system of punishment.

489
00:24:20,918 --> 00:24:23,087
These criminals... well,

490
00:24:24,297 --> 00:24:26,674
they must be treated
with absolute authority.

491
00:24:27,008 --> 00:24:29,343
They don't have the
intelligence to grasp the idea

492
00:24:29,677 --> 00:24:33,306
they are being controlled
on a cyberscape level.

493
00:24:35,057 --> 00:24:37,477
You work for the program.

494
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:38,528
We do not want you to show

495
00:24:38,728 --> 00:24:41,063
one single prisoner
any respect whatsoever.

496
00:24:41,397 --> 00:24:44,525
They do not deserve respect, understood?

497
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:46,868
Understood?

498
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:50,830
Yeah.

499
00:24:51,657 --> 00:24:53,659
Amazingly rude, Daniel.

500
00:24:57,246 --> 00:25:01,083
(sighs) Well, thank you, Will.

501
00:25:04,045 --> 00:25:05,513
I'll be watching.

502
00:25:05,713 --> 00:25:08,382
(computer chirps)

503
00:25:08,716 --> 00:25:10,635
(computer chirps)

504
00:25:10,968 --> 00:25:13,429
(clock ticking)

505
00:25:18,476 --> 00:25:21,437
(ominous music)
(man laughing)

506
00:25:21,771 --> 00:25:22,697
(group chattering)

507
00:25:22,897 --> 00:25:25,107
(door bangs)

508
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:31,113
(door bangs)

509
00:25:31,447 --> 00:25:32,749
On your way to the women's section?

510
00:25:32,949 --> 00:25:35,743
(program whooshing)

511
00:25:37,703 --> 00:25:39,004
What is it?

512
00:25:40,206 --> 00:25:41,507
What is that?

513
00:25:41,707 --> 00:25:42,884
What... what the fuck is...?

514
00:25:43,084 --> 00:25:43,718
What is that?

515
00:25:43,918 --> 00:25:45,545
What the fuck is that?
- Relax, Martin.

516
00:25:45,878 --> 00:25:48,714
It's just the program rebooting itself.

517
00:25:49,048 --> 00:25:51,008
Rebooting itself.

518
00:25:51,342 --> 00:25:54,762
Look, I wasn't raised to be
rebooted every two hours, okay?

519
00:25:55,096 --> 00:25:57,723
Stu, I can't, uh, I can't keep talking

520
00:25:58,057 --> 00:25:59,976
to you like this, all right?

521
00:26:00,309 --> 00:26:01,609
Will.

522
00:26:02,144 --> 00:26:03,279
(door clanking)

523
00:26:03,479 --> 00:26:05,690
(door bangs)

524
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:10,194
You know what I'm in for, don't you?

525
00:26:12,405 --> 00:26:13,705
Murder.

526
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:15,375
Federal agent.

527
00:26:15,575 --> 00:26:17,827
(door bangs)

528
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,337
You're the only one I
can tell the truth to.

529
00:26:19,537 --> 00:26:20,837
Stop.

530
00:26:22,957 --> 00:26:25,543
I know what they tell me.

531
00:26:25,876 --> 00:26:27,176
My dad died.

532
00:26:28,045 --> 00:26:32,008
Payments were owed, there wasn't
anybody gonna bail us out.

533
00:26:32,341 --> 00:26:33,884
I know it was stupid,

534
00:26:35,094 --> 00:26:37,346
but I just couldn't
walk away from the farm.

535
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:40,016
Ten generations of my family
looking over my shoulder,

536
00:26:40,349 --> 00:26:43,519
counting on me to do the right thing.

537
00:26:43,853 --> 00:26:46,063
I wasn't gonna shoot anybody.

538
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:48,866
I just wasn't gonna lay there like a dog

539
00:26:49,066 --> 00:26:52,194
and let them take everything I ever had.

540
00:26:53,529 --> 00:26:54,789
(door clicks)

541
00:26:54,989 --> 00:26:56,289
He died.

542
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:04,290
And they arrested me for the
murder of a federal agent.

543
00:27:04,624 --> 00:27:05,924
Death penalty.

544
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:09,795
(door bangs)

545
00:27:10,129 --> 00:27:12,423
(sighs) You are the only person

546
00:27:12,757 --> 00:27:15,968
that knows the truth about what happened.

547
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:21,057
Mace was only 16, he didn't deserve that.

548
00:27:25,519 --> 00:27:27,813
(Stu sighs)

549
00:27:28,147 --> 00:27:29,657
So there you are.

550
00:27:30,983 --> 00:27:33,861
That's some hard luck, man.

551
00:27:34,195 --> 00:27:36,822
(door bangs)

552
00:27:37,156 --> 00:27:39,617
You'd had done the same thing.

553
00:27:40,868 --> 00:27:42,662
Wouldn't you, Will?

554
00:27:42,995 --> 00:27:44,755
I don't know, Stu.

555
00:27:46,707 --> 00:27:47,508
Look, I gotta go.

556
00:27:47,708 --> 00:27:50,252
(brooding synth music)

557
00:27:54,131 --> 00:27:56,050
(computer whirring)

558
00:27:56,384 --> 00:27:59,011
(computer chirps)

559
00:28:03,766 --> 00:28:05,351
(door bangs)

560
00:28:05,685 --> 00:28:06,527
Will!

561
00:28:06,727 --> 00:28:08,027
Will!

562
00:28:08,396 --> 00:28:09,696
Will!

563
00:28:10,398 --> 00:28:11,449
(ominous music)

564
00:28:11,649 --> 00:28:13,275
My time's coming soon.

565
00:28:14,819 --> 00:28:16,078
You'll be taking that walk with me.

566
00:28:16,278 --> 00:28:18,030
That's right, Baracus,

567
00:28:18,364 --> 00:28:20,467
and there's a lot of people
looking forward to that day.

568
00:28:20,491 --> 00:28:24,995
Oh, yes, so many people
think I've ruined their lives.

569
00:28:25,329 --> 00:28:26,088
(door bangs)

570
00:28:26,288 --> 00:28:28,999
I didn't just remove loved ones,

571
00:28:29,333 --> 00:28:32,086
sometimes I removed problems.

572
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:33,804
You should thank me.

573
00:28:34,004 --> 00:28:36,924
You do have a unique
perspective, Baracus.

574
00:28:37,258 --> 00:28:38,767
And you do, too.

575
00:28:39,468 --> 00:28:42,304
Intelligence has its
own perspective, Will.

576
00:28:42,638 --> 00:28:43,314
(door bangs)

577
00:28:43,514 --> 00:28:45,307
[Will] Yeah, I've
got a schedule to keep.

578
00:28:45,641 --> 00:28:49,520
Will, you're my only
link to the outside, Will.

579
00:28:52,022 --> 00:28:53,322
I know you.

580
00:28:54,442 --> 00:28:58,654
I know your capabilities
mentally, physically.

581
00:28:58,988 --> 00:29:01,866
Don't waste 'em on this menial job

582
00:29:02,199 --> 00:29:04,577
and those silly games you play.

583
00:29:05,911 --> 00:29:10,207
Will, let me help you
reach your full potential.

584
00:29:10,541 --> 00:29:13,502
I gotta give you credit, Baracus,

585
00:29:13,836 --> 00:29:16,380
you always give it a good effort.

586
00:29:21,135 --> 00:29:23,471
(door bangs)

587
00:29:26,724 --> 00:29:29,059
(door bangs)

588
00:29:32,813 --> 00:29:34,523
Where's Stewart Lewis?

589
00:29:34,857 --> 00:29:36,200
I don't know.

590
00:29:37,193 --> 00:29:38,778
They put me in here.

591
00:29:40,362 --> 00:29:43,157
(door bangs)

592
00:29:43,491 --> 00:29:44,125
(computer beeps)

593
00:29:44,325 --> 00:29:46,994
There are no unscheduled downlinkings.

594
00:29:47,328 --> 00:29:48,796
You must make a schedule.

595
00:29:48,996 --> 00:29:51,248
Where was Stewart Lewis transferred to?

596
00:29:51,582 --> 00:29:53,334
[Coworker] Does it really matter?

597
00:29:53,667 --> 00:29:54,343
(computer beeps)

598
00:29:54,543 --> 00:29:57,838
[Employee] Stewart Lewis, lot
397, transferred all freeze.

599
00:29:58,172 --> 00:29:59,472
Shit!

600
00:29:59,965 --> 00:30:03,052
Request vidcon with Mr. Traven, ASAP.

601
00:30:03,385 --> 00:30:05,145
[Employee] No available
meetings scheduled.

602
00:30:05,387 --> 00:30:06,687
Will notify.

603
00:30:07,264 --> 00:30:10,226
You don't understand, I insist.

604
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:11,193
[Employee] One moment.

605
00:30:11,393 --> 00:30:13,062
(computer beeps)

606
00:30:13,395 --> 00:30:15,314
Yes, Will, how may I help you?

607
00:30:15,648 --> 00:30:18,859
Where was Stewart Lewis transferred to?

608
00:30:19,944 --> 00:30:22,264
You see, this is what happens
when you make an attachment

609
00:30:22,363 --> 00:30:26,909
to these kinds of people.
Get nothing but trouble.

610
00:30:27,243 --> 00:30:28,294
He was transferred, I don't know why.

611
00:30:28,494 --> 00:30:30,454
This program is much better.

612
00:30:30,788 --> 00:30:31,422
Is that all?

613
00:30:31,622 --> 00:30:34,250
I need more information, Traven.

614
00:30:36,502 --> 00:30:37,345
That's all I have.

615
00:30:37,545 --> 00:30:38,262
It's a closed file.

616
00:30:38,462 --> 00:30:40,381
Now, I've got work to do.

617
00:30:40,714 --> 00:30:43,092
Will, do not make this a habit.

618
00:30:44,176 --> 00:30:44,935
(computer beeps)

619
00:30:45,135 --> 00:30:45,770
Fuck!

620
00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:47,479
This is bullshit.

621
00:30:50,182 --> 00:30:50,941
Tory work.

622
00:30:51,141 --> 00:30:52,276
(computer beeps)

623
00:30:52,476 --> 00:30:54,496
[Receptionist] There's a
phone call for you, Ms. Conroy.

624
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:56,146
It's your boyfriend.

625
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,780
Ugh.

626
00:30:58,190 --> 00:30:59,490
All right.

627
00:31:01,068 --> 00:31:02,620
Yeah, what is it?

628
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:03,454
Yeah, this is a switch,

629
00:31:03,654 --> 00:31:06,490
but, uh, I'm gonna be
running late tonight.

630
00:31:06,824 --> 00:31:08,209
Why?

631
00:31:08,409 --> 00:31:11,495
Uh, Stu Lewis was
transferred out of Idwell today

632
00:31:11,829 --> 00:31:13,130
and I've gotta find out why.

633
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:14,465
[Tory] Stu Lewis?

634
00:31:14,665 --> 00:31:16,726
Jesus, Tory, I've told you
about him a million times.

635
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:17,385
Well, I don't remember.

636
00:31:17,585 --> 00:31:18,427
Is there a problem?

637
00:31:18,627 --> 00:31:19,512
Yeah, there's a few actually,

638
00:31:19,712 --> 00:31:23,173
but I'd rather not speak
about it over open air.

639
00:31:23,507 --> 00:31:26,719
(laughs) Don't do anything stupid, Will.

640
00:31:27,052 --> 00:31:27,895
I know that, Tory.

641
00:31:28,095 --> 00:31:30,264
Look, they put him under all freeze.

642
00:31:30,598 --> 00:31:31,941
What's that?

643
00:31:32,141 --> 00:31:33,741
All freeze designation is usually held

644
00:31:33,893 --> 00:31:35,686
for convicts turned informant.

645
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:36,654
Well, good, maybe he's

646
00:31:36,854 --> 00:31:39,023
in a witness protection
program or something.

647
00:31:39,356 --> 00:31:40,366
No, that's the problem, there's no way.

648
00:31:40,566 --> 00:31:42,860
Stu didn't have any shaky
connections like that.

649
00:31:43,193 --> 00:31:44,036
How do you know?

650
00:31:44,236 --> 00:31:46,030
I mean, they all say they're innocent.

651
00:31:46,363 --> 00:31:47,123
He's just another one of them.

652
00:31:47,323 --> 00:31:48,833
I believe him, Tory.

653
00:31:49,033 --> 00:31:50,701
(Tory sighs)

654
00:31:51,035 --> 00:31:52,294
He's a criminal.

655
00:31:52,494 --> 00:31:54,496
He deserves everything he gets.

656
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:58,042
Look, don't do anything
asinine over one of them.

657
00:31:58,375 --> 00:31:59,969
You are a cold bitch.

658
00:32:00,169 --> 00:32:02,087
Did you just call me a bitch?

659
00:32:02,421 --> 00:32:03,556
Because if you did...
- Delete.

660
00:32:03,756 --> 00:32:04,348
I'm gonna fucking...

661
00:32:04,548 --> 00:32:06,926
(computer beeps)

662
00:32:07,259 --> 00:32:08,559
All right.

663
00:32:09,929 --> 00:32:11,230
Let's get down to business.

664
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:13,933
(tense music)

665
00:32:26,904 --> 00:32:29,573
(flags rustling)

666
00:32:35,913 --> 00:32:38,666
(machine beeping)

667
00:32:48,634 --> 00:32:50,427
Request all information on Stewart Lewis.

668
00:32:50,761 --> 00:32:52,638
(computer beeps)

669
00:32:52,972 --> 00:32:54,682
All freeze.

670
00:32:58,268 --> 00:33:00,688
Where do prisoners go
for final termination?

671
00:33:01,021 --> 00:33:03,023
Taken to an unspecified location

672
00:33:03,357 --> 00:33:05,150
for removal of li-li-life.

673
00:33:05,484 --> 00:33:09,697
Authorize prison guard
requesting specific location.

674
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:12,241
St-st-state your clearance.

675
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,627
So that's where Stu Lewis is?

676
00:33:14,827 --> 00:33:16,337
(computer beeps)

677
00:33:16,537 --> 00:33:18,897
[Computer] All freeze, all
freeze, approach for clearance.

678
00:33:18,956 --> 00:33:20,382
Verbal interaction over.

679
00:33:20,582 --> 00:33:21,383
Suck off.

680
00:33:21,583 --> 00:33:22,468
(computer beeps)

681
00:33:22,668 --> 00:33:23,552
Th-th-thank you.

682
00:33:23,752 --> 00:33:26,296
(computer beeps)

683
00:33:29,299 --> 00:33:31,885

(computer beeping)

722
00:36:15,174 --> 00:36:17,092
What took you so long?

723
00:36:18,468 --> 00:36:21,346
People are dying to meet you.

724
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:24,892
So this is what you
do with the prisoners?

725
00:36:26,351 --> 00:36:28,937
I've given them purpose, Will.

726
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:36,028
My consumer games, which
you excel at, by the way,

727
00:36:36,361 --> 00:36:38,281
are controlled by the most
sophisticated programs

728
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:40,290
that can be written.

729
00:36:41,491 --> 00:36:43,493
The code for these contains thousands

730
00:36:43,827 --> 00:36:45,954
of gigabytes of information.

731
00:36:47,289 --> 00:36:51,627
That's a mere fraction of
what the human brain holds.

732
00:36:52,753 --> 00:36:56,340
People are dangerous, unpredictable.

733
00:36:56,673 --> 00:36:57,641
Their survival instinct

734
00:36:57,841 --> 00:37:01,220
allows them to react instantaneously.

735
00:37:01,553 --> 00:37:04,264
Now that would make this an exciting play.

736
00:37:04,598 --> 00:37:05,816
Jesus, you've done it.

737
00:37:06,016 --> 00:37:06,942
[R.D.] I've created the world's

738
00:37:07,142 --> 00:37:11,563
most realistic virtual game. (laughing)

739
00:37:11,897 --> 00:37:13,198
You are a sick bastard, Crowley.

740
00:37:13,398 --> 00:37:16,693
Oh, please, don't be judgmental.

741
00:37:19,071 --> 00:37:22,532
You were handpicked from the
top players of my consumer net.

742
00:37:22,866 --> 00:37:24,993
If you weren't so damn good...

743
00:37:26,536 --> 00:37:29,206
All you needed was a little...

744
00:37:29,539 --> 00:37:30,257
[Tory] Motivation.

745
00:37:30,457 --> 00:37:33,335
(brooding music)

746
00:37:33,669 --> 00:37:34,969
Tory.

747
00:37:36,922 --> 00:37:38,222
Thank you.

748
00:37:40,050 --> 00:37:41,760
I was right about you.

749
00:37:42,094 --> 00:37:44,096
You are a cold bitch.

750
00:37:44,429 --> 00:37:45,729
Vicious.

751
00:37:46,765 --> 00:37:50,644
(sighs) You see, Will, I
knew you were intelligent.

752
00:37:50,978 --> 00:37:53,981
All that was needed was to
feed you a little information,

753
00:37:54,314 --> 00:37:56,275
and that's where Ms. Conroy

754
00:37:57,484 --> 00:37:58,619
(lips smack)

755
00:37:58,819 --> 00:38:00,204
was so helpful.

756
00:38:00,404 --> 00:38:01,830
I bet she was.

757
00:38:06,743 --> 00:38:10,122
I'd like to present
some of my associates.

758
00:38:10,455 --> 00:38:11,965
Heinz Dietrich.

759
00:38:12,165 --> 00:38:15,919
One of the preeminent
industrialists of our time.

760
00:38:17,045 --> 00:38:20,007
Montgomery Valentine, the last scion

761
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:22,592
of a fine, old Southern family.

762
00:38:22,926 --> 00:38:26,888
Mr. Valentine prides himself
on being a sportsman.

763
00:38:29,558 --> 00:38:33,729
And of course, Daniel Traven,
your superior officer.

764
00:38:36,148 --> 00:38:39,151
You can be part of the ultimate game.

765
00:38:41,278 --> 00:38:42,871
Of course, your function in this game

766
00:38:43,071 --> 00:38:46,533
is to provide a challenge
to these sporting men,

767
00:38:46,867 --> 00:38:49,661
who have paid handsomely, I might add,

768
00:38:50,662 --> 00:38:53,081
to hunt you down and kill you.

769
00:38:57,711 --> 00:38:59,463
Now, you will be placed

770
00:39:00,756 --> 00:39:04,092
in an historical scenario of my choosing.

771
00:39:04,426 --> 00:39:06,595
Your garb and weapons will
be accurately detailed

772
00:39:06,928 --> 00:39:08,438
and quite deadly.

773
00:39:09,931 --> 00:39:13,810
If you dispatch the three
gentlemen, you survive

774
00:39:14,144 --> 00:39:16,772
until the next scenario, of course.

775
00:39:19,358 --> 00:39:22,277
Gentlemen, you get what you pay for.

776
00:39:24,529 --> 00:39:28,325
Welcome to your greatest challenge yet.

777
00:39:28,658 --> 00:39:29,668
(suspenseful music)

778
00:39:29,868 --> 00:39:31,628
Take him to surgery.

779
00:39:42,381 --> 00:39:43,849
(gun bangs)

780
00:39:44,049 --> 00:39:46,760
(group chattering)

781
00:39:49,888 --> 00:39:51,723
(man yelling)

782
00:39:52,057 --> 00:39:54,434
(guns firing)

783
00:39:56,395 --> 00:39:59,439
Our prey should be
appearing at any moment now.

784
00:39:59,773 --> 00:40:00,616
(gun bangs)

785
00:40:00,816 --> 00:40:04,611
Mr. Traven, I find your
attire very intriguing.

786
00:40:04,945 --> 00:40:08,657
Unlike you, I like to get my hands wet.

787
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:11,118
The scale of this battle's incredible.

788
00:40:11,451 --> 00:40:13,703
Crowley, you've outdone yourself.

789
00:40:14,037 --> 00:40:15,705
Your program is fantastische.

790
00:40:16,039 --> 00:40:18,250
And a damn fine day for a little sport,

791
00:40:18,583 --> 00:40:20,010
don't you think, gentlemen?

792
00:40:20,210 --> 00:40:21,094
(suspenseful music)

793
00:40:21,294 --> 00:40:22,512
(gun firing)

794
00:40:22,712 --> 00:40:25,424
(group chattering)

795
00:40:26,675 --> 00:40:29,177
(guns banging)

796
00:40:35,058 --> 00:40:37,644
(guns banging)

797
00:40:37,978 --> 00:40:40,522
(group groaning)

798
00:40:41,606 --> 00:40:43,241
Ah, this is great.

799
00:40:44,609 --> 00:40:45,869
You know how to load a musket?

800
00:40:46,069 --> 00:40:47,079
(gun bangs)

801
00:40:47,279 --> 00:40:48,080
Actually, I do.

802
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:50,031
(gun fires)

803
00:40:50,365 --> 00:40:51,667
Do it quick.

804
00:40:51,867 --> 00:40:52,751
Try and stay alive.

805
00:40:52,951 --> 00:40:54,419
Figure a way out of this mess.

806
00:40:54,619 --> 00:40:56,997
(guns banging)

807
00:40:58,248 --> 00:41:00,750
(guns banging)

808
00:41:01,751 --> 00:41:03,420
There's too much smoke.

809
00:41:03,753 --> 00:41:05,264
Can't see who's firing at us.

810
00:41:05,464 --> 00:41:07,257
Yeah, we gotta figure
out who our enemy is

811
00:41:07,591 --> 00:41:08,767
and who's on our side.

812
00:41:08,967 --> 00:41:09,810
(guns firing)

813
00:41:10,010 --> 00:41:12,345
Uh, Will, they made us Red Coats.

814
00:41:12,679 --> 00:41:14,239
The American colonials are our enemies.

815
00:41:14,514 --> 00:41:15,607
(guns banging)

816
00:41:15,807 --> 00:41:17,893
Crowley's such a bastard.

817
00:41:18,226 --> 00:41:21,229
This could be the French and Indian War,

818
00:41:21,563 --> 00:41:25,150
which would mean the American
colonials are on our side.

819
00:41:25,484 --> 00:41:26,660
We're actually fighting the French army

820
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:27,953
and their Huron allies.

821
00:41:28,153 --> 00:41:28,787
(gun bangs)

822
00:41:28,987 --> 00:41:30,989
Uh, we're screwed.

823
00:41:31,323 --> 00:41:31,957
(gun bangs)

824
00:41:32,157 --> 00:41:32,833
We don't know who were fighting

825
00:41:33,033 --> 00:41:35,327
'til they come up and
shoot us in the face.

826
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:36,461
Pretty much.

827
00:41:36,661 --> 00:41:38,497
(guns banging)

828
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:41,208
(guns banging)

829
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:47,172
(birds chirping)

830
00:41:47,506 --> 00:41:49,132
(gun fires)

831
00:41:49,466 --> 00:41:50,726
(gun fires)
(bullet whooshes)

832
00:41:50,926 --> 00:41:53,303
(guns banging)

833
00:42:06,191 --> 00:42:07,409
(gun fires)

834
00:42:07,609 --> 00:42:10,070
(program buzzing)

835
00:42:10,403 --> 00:42:13,156
(group yelling)

836
00:42:13,490 --> 00:42:15,492
(body thudding)

837
00:42:15,825 --> 00:42:19,120
(computer beeping)

838
00:42:19,454 --> 00:42:20,754
Damn.

839
00:42:21,790 --> 00:42:23,667
That boy has a damn fine eye.

840
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,093
(group yelling)

841
00:42:25,293 --> 00:42:26,720
A lot of time on the farm.

842
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:27,554
(gun bangs)

843
00:42:27,754 --> 00:42:29,464
You could say I'm the best shot in Iowa.

844
00:42:29,798 --> 00:42:31,716
(guns banging)

845
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:33,350
Shit.

846
00:42:33,718 --> 00:42:35,018
Daniel.

847
00:42:35,512 --> 00:42:36,812
Dietrich.

848
00:42:37,931 --> 00:42:39,441
Reload?

849
00:42:39,641 --> 00:42:41,935
No, we're dead out here in the open.

850
00:42:42,269 --> 00:42:43,945
Let's go for cover.

851
00:42:45,021 --> 00:42:47,649
(guns banging)

852
00:42:47,983 --> 00:42:49,534
(hatchet thuds)
(Daniel grunts)

853
00:42:49,734 --> 00:42:50,702
(guns banging)

854
00:42:50,902 --> 00:42:52,162

855
00:42:52,362 --> 00:42:53,038

(cloth ripping)
(gun bangs)

874
00:43:43,496 --> 00:43:44,256
[Guard] Halt.

875
00:43:44,456 --> 00:43:45,173
Who goes there?

876
00:43:45,373 --> 00:43:46,673
As you were.

877
00:43:56,051 --> 00:43:58,553
(man gurgling)

878
00:44:01,431 --> 00:44:02,691

(Daniel groans)

901
00:45:41,614 --> 00:45:43,491
(computer beeps)

902
00:45:43,825 --> 00:45:45,335
(computer beeps)

903
00:45:45,535 --> 00:45:47,203
Things are getting interesting.

904
00:45:47,537 --> 00:45:48,630
Indeed.

905
00:45:48,830 --> 00:45:50,999
I am in love with the multiple prey angle.

906
00:45:51,332 --> 00:45:52,717
Well, I must say I'm pleased to see

907
00:45:52,917 --> 00:45:55,920
that you gentlemen are
enjoying yourselves.

908
00:45:56,254 --> 00:45:58,506
Of course, more prey means more money.

909
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:01,634
I think we all understand
the tenets of capitalism.

910
00:46:01,968 --> 00:46:02,769
Now, let's play.

911
00:46:02,969 --> 00:46:04,229
Now, hold your horses.

912
00:46:04,429 --> 00:46:07,015
I'd like to know what it is I'm hunting.

913
00:46:07,348 --> 00:46:10,059
Give me the psych profile on that guard.

914
00:46:10,393 --> 00:46:11,693
Of course.

915
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:14,780
He's single.

916
00:46:15,607 --> 00:46:17,525
Has a normal upbringing.

917
00:46:19,194 --> 00:46:21,196
And he has an acute interest in history,

918
00:46:21,529 --> 00:46:25,992
which manifests itself in
obsessive VR game playing,

919
00:46:26,326 --> 00:46:30,872
such as martial arts, target
practice, flight simulating.

920
00:46:31,206 --> 00:46:32,791
Flight simulation?

921
00:46:33,124 --> 00:46:34,509
(plane engine roaring)

922
00:46:34,709 --> 00:46:36,294
I know how to fly.

923
00:46:36,628 --> 00:46:37,928
I do.

924
00:46:40,507 --> 00:46:42,509
Just not a real one.

925
00:46:42,842 --> 00:46:45,345
(cannon banging)

926
00:46:49,307 --> 00:46:50,942
(explosion booming)

927
00:46:52,227 --> 00:46:56,147
(suspenseful music)

928
00:47:08,076 --> 00:47:09,911
[Stu] What do I do?

929
00:47:10,245 --> 00:47:10,879
What you mean?

930
00:47:11,079 --> 00:47:12,505
You're the best shot in Iowa.

931
00:47:12,705 --> 00:47:14,290
Let's get going.

932
00:47:14,624 --> 00:47:15,467
Oh, great.

933
00:47:15,667 --> 00:47:17,710
That's easy for you to say.

934
00:47:21,631 --> 00:47:22,724
(gun banging)

935
00:47:22,924 --> 00:47:24,100
I winged him.

936
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:26,302
(bullet whooshes)

937
00:47:26,636 --> 00:47:27,812
Shit.

938
00:47:28,012 --> 00:47:30,265
I gotta get out of his sights.

939
00:47:33,142 --> 00:47:33,985
[Stu] Keep it steady.

940
00:47:34,185 --> 00:47:35,778
I think I got him.

941
00:47:37,689 --> 00:47:39,691
[Will] Damn, he's good.

942
00:47:40,942 --> 00:47:43,570
(Heinz laughing)

943
00:47:44,737 --> 00:47:46,698
[Stu] Watch out, he's
coming up on our tail.

944
00:47:47,031 --> 00:47:49,033
(gun banging)

945
00:47:49,367 --> 00:47:51,661
[Will] Did I lose him?

946
00:47:51,995 --> 00:47:52,962
No.

947
00:47:53,162 --> 00:47:53,797
Fine.

948
00:47:53,997 --> 00:47:56,040
(bullets clanging)

949
00:47:56,374 --> 00:47:57,592
I got him.

950
00:47:57,792 --> 00:47:59,544
[Will] Sure about that?

951
00:47:59,878 --> 00:48:02,672
[Stu] Yeah, look, he's going down.

952
00:48:03,798 --> 00:48:05,098
Whoo!

953
00:48:05,592 --> 00:48:08,553
(Heinz screaming)

954
00:48:08,887 --> 00:48:12,056
(explosion booming)

955
00:48:12,390 --> 00:48:13,483
(cannon bangs)

956
00:48:13,683 --> 00:48:15,727
Dammit, anti-aircraft fire.

957
00:48:17,103 --> 00:48:18,071
[Stu] My machine gun's useless.

958
00:48:18,271 --> 00:48:19,571
Goddammit.

959
00:48:22,275 --> 00:48:26,195
Hey, when I bow, throw our
last bomb up off my hand.

960
00:48:26,529 --> 00:48:29,532
(cannon bangs)

961
00:48:29,866 --> 00:48:32,702
Steady, steady... drop that bitch.

962
00:48:33,036 --> 00:48:34,170
(cannon bangs)

963
00:48:34,370 --> 00:48:35,839
(explosion booming)

964
00:48:36,039 --> 00:48:37,624
Shit, that was close.

965
00:48:37,957 --> 00:48:38,842
[Stu] I thought close counted

966
00:48:39,042 --> 00:48:41,127
in horseshoes and hand grenades?

967
00:48:41,461 --> 00:48:42,761
Damn.

968
00:48:43,171 --> 00:48:44,264
(gun banging)

969
00:48:44,464 --> 00:48:46,591
(metal clanging)

970
00:48:46,925 --> 00:48:48,225
Christ!

971
00:48:49,552 --> 00:48:50,603
It's Valentine.

972
00:48:50,803 --> 00:48:52,889
What are you waiting for?

973
00:48:53,222 --> 00:48:55,433
(gun firing)

974
00:48:55,767 --> 00:48:59,562
Whoa, he's in a Fokker
Triplane, we're fucked.

975
00:48:59,896 --> 00:49:01,239
Not if I can help it.

976
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:04,150
(gun banging)
(Stu yelling)

977
00:49:04,484 --> 00:49:05,118
(Montgomery laughing)

978
00:49:05,318 --> 00:49:06,911
(bullets clanging)

979
00:49:07,111 --> 00:49:07,746
Good job.

980
00:49:07,946 --> 00:49:09,864
You got him off us.

981
00:49:10,198 --> 00:49:12,617
(gun firing)

982
00:49:12,951 --> 00:49:15,495
All right, let's go for the tank.

983
00:49:17,330 --> 00:49:20,249
[Stu] Damn, he's back on our tail.

984
00:49:21,542 --> 00:49:23,169
(cannon booms)

985
00:49:23,503 --> 00:49:24,137
Here goes nothing.

986
00:49:24,337 --> 00:49:29,050
(explosion booming)
(program buzzing)

987
00:49:29,384 --> 00:49:30,393
Yeah!

988
00:49:30,593 --> 00:49:31,269
Whoo!

989
00:49:31,469 --> 00:49:32,937
[Stu] Wait, Will, don't get cocky.

990
00:49:33,137 --> 00:49:37,266
We still got company.
(gun firing)

991
00:49:39,936 --> 00:49:42,605
[Will] Damn, this guy's tricky.

992
00:49:48,361 --> 00:49:50,780
(gun banging)

993
00:49:53,282 --> 00:49:54,375
(gun firing)

994
00:49:54,575 --> 00:49:56,119
Where the hell is he?

995
00:50:01,666 --> 00:50:03,668
[Stu] Watch out, he's
dropping in behind us.

996
00:50:04,002 --> 00:50:06,295
(gun firing)

997
00:50:12,927 --> 00:50:14,478
Hold on, baby!

998
00:50:18,641 --> 00:50:21,561
[Stu] What the hell are you doing?

999
00:50:23,771 --> 00:50:24,656
[Will] Trust me.

1000
00:50:24,856 --> 00:50:27,150
(gun banging)

1001
00:50:29,610 --> 00:50:32,572
[Stu] Jesus Christ, I don't like this.

1002
00:50:32,905 --> 00:50:36,200
[Will] Come on, baby, pull together now!

1003
00:50:37,994 --> 00:50:40,371
(gun firing)

1004
00:50:42,749 --> 00:50:44,500
[Stu] Shit, oh shit!

1005
00:50:46,252 --> 00:50:48,671
(gun banging)

1006
00:51:00,266 --> 00:51:03,019
(engine clanking)

1007
00:51:17,158 --> 00:51:18,751
(plane whooshes)

1008
00:51:18,951 --> 00:51:20,503
(Montgomery screaming)

1009
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:23,498
(explosion booming)

1010
00:51:27,126 --> 00:51:28,878
Not out of this yet!

1011
00:51:35,718 --> 00:51:37,103
Come on, baby!

1012
00:51:37,804 --> 00:51:40,807
[Stu] Come on, Will, you can do it!

1013
00:51:42,558 --> 00:51:43,858
Yeah!

1014
00:51:46,062 --> 00:51:49,023
Uh-oh, our fuel line's been shot out.

1015
00:51:50,191 --> 00:51:51,826
We're going down.

1016
00:51:52,735 --> 00:51:54,286
[Stu] Kidding?

1017
00:51:55,113 --> 00:51:56,906
(dramatic music)

1018
00:51:57,240 --> 00:51:59,450
[Will] It's not responding.

1019
00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:04,288
(plane engine roaring)

1020
00:52:09,293 --> 00:52:11,212
We're not gonna make it.

1021
00:52:13,339 --> 00:52:15,007
They're going down.

1022
00:52:17,218 --> 00:52:19,971
[Daniel] Who would get the kill?

1023
00:52:21,973 --> 00:52:24,600
Mr. Valentine would get the kill.

1024
00:52:24,934 --> 00:52:26,561
He shot off the round.

1025
00:52:31,732 --> 00:52:33,317
I don't know, man.

1026
00:52:34,861 --> 00:52:36,362
(clock ticking)

1027
00:52:36,696 --> 00:52:39,031
(wind blowing)

1028
00:52:42,201 --> 00:52:44,203
Oh, fine, pull them out.

1029
00:52:44,537 --> 00:52:47,165
That is not a kill to be proud of.

1030
00:52:48,416 --> 00:52:50,334
You never disappoint me, Montgomery.

1031
00:52:50,668 --> 00:52:52,670
I must say, you're quite a sportsmen.

1032
00:52:53,004 --> 00:52:56,591
I wouldn't have done it, but very good.

1033
00:52:56,924 --> 00:52:59,135
Personally, Mr. Traven,
I don't get a damn

1034
00:52:59,468 --> 00:53:02,597
about what you would
or would not have done.

1035
00:53:02,930 --> 00:53:06,559
However, in appreciation of my largesse,

1036
00:53:06,893 --> 00:53:07,652
I would hope that you gentlemen

1037
00:53:07,852 --> 00:53:10,813
would let me choose the next scenario.

1038
00:53:12,982 --> 00:53:15,735
Why, the enthusiasm you men exude

1039
00:53:16,068 --> 00:53:17,620
makes me wanna play myself.

1040
00:53:17,820 --> 00:53:22,074
If you do, Crowley, make
sure you play the full ray.

1041
00:53:25,286 --> 00:53:28,623
I have a surprise for you
on this next scenario, Heinz.

1042
00:53:28,956 --> 00:53:30,625
I think you'll love it.

1043
00:53:30,958 --> 00:53:32,585
Cannot wait.

1044
00:53:32,919 --> 00:53:37,715
(upbeat jazz music)
(group chattering)

1045
00:53:53,856 --> 00:53:55,156
Stay cool.

1046
00:54:00,112 --> 00:54:01,581
They could come from anywhere.

1047
00:54:01,781 --> 00:54:04,242
(guns clicking)

1048
00:54:10,206 --> 00:54:12,875
(woman laughing)

1049
00:54:22,218 --> 00:54:23,518
Nice touch.

1050
00:54:25,346 --> 00:54:28,266
I've got a bad feeling about this.

1051
00:54:30,017 --> 00:54:32,144
We gotta quit meetin' like this.

1052
00:54:32,478 --> 00:54:35,648
(sighs) Baracus.

1053
00:54:35,982 --> 00:54:37,033
This one's gonna be fun.

1054
00:54:37,233 --> 00:54:40,820
This a prohibition
speakeasy, all we got is .45s.

1055
00:54:41,153 --> 00:54:42,798
Well, that oughta make
things interesting, huh?

1056
00:54:42,822 --> 00:54:44,498
Please, no photos.

1057
00:54:45,241 --> 00:54:46,584
(camera clicks)

1058
00:54:46,784 --> 00:54:48,661
[Man] Back, hey, scram.

1059
00:54:50,955 --> 00:54:55,167
I said no photos, it
gives her a headache.

1060
00:54:55,501 --> 00:54:57,545
Oh, I just need one shot.

1061
00:54:58,462 --> 00:54:59,222
(gun bangs)

1062
00:54:59,422 --> 00:55:00,306
[Woman] Oh, my god.

1063
00:55:00,506 --> 00:55:03,050
Oh, my god, there's
blood all over the place.

1064
00:55:03,384 --> 00:55:05,720
- Somebody help her.
- Who is that?

1065
00:55:06,053 --> 00:55:08,723
We don't have to play
by their rules. See? Huh?

1066
00:55:09,056 --> 00:55:10,024
You dirty rat!

1067
00:55:10,224 --> 00:55:11,809
(gun banging)

1068
00:55:12,143 --> 00:55:14,437
(Baracus laughing)

1069
00:55:14,770 --> 00:55:16,197
You only got seven rounds.

1070
00:55:16,397 --> 00:55:19,567
You might wanna save your ammo, tough guy.

1071
00:55:19,900 --> 00:55:21,200
Yeah.

1072
00:55:22,486 --> 00:55:25,573
(guns firing)
(group screaming)

1073
00:55:25,906 --> 00:55:28,284
(guns banging)

1074
00:55:36,083 --> 00:55:38,753
(guns banging)

1075
00:55:39,086 --> 00:55:40,429
(gun banging)

1076
00:55:40,629 --> 00:55:41,430
[Will] Go out the back, go out the back.

1077
00:55:41,630 --> 00:55:45,301
They're getting away. (yells)

1078
00:55:45,634 --> 00:55:47,845
(jazz music)

1079
00:55:51,015 --> 00:55:52,558
(gun clicks)

1080
00:55:52,892 --> 00:55:55,603
(gun bangs)
(group chattering)

1081
00:55:55,936 --> 00:55:56,696
[Will] Where are the
others, can you see?

1082
00:55:56,896 --> 00:55:57,530
[Stu] I think we lost him.

1083
00:55:57,730 --> 00:55:58,447
[Will] No, no, he's right behind us.

1084
00:55:58,647 --> 00:56:00,733
Come on, come on, come on.

1085
00:56:01,067 --> 00:56:01,826
(gun clicks)

1086
00:56:02,026 --> 00:56:02,660
[Showgirl] What the hell was that?

1087
00:56:02,860 --> 00:56:06,155
[Showgirl 2] Shh,
shh. Wait. I wanna hear.

1088
00:56:06,489 --> 00:56:07,373
There's gotta be a way out of here.

1089
00:56:07,573 --> 00:56:09,492
(group chattering)
(gun bangs)

1090
00:56:09,825 --> 00:56:11,502
This way, this way.

1091
00:56:14,663 --> 00:56:15,423
Come on, up here.

1092
00:56:15,623 --> 00:56:16,340
(group chattering)

1093
00:56:16,540 --> 00:56:17,675
It's like a labyrinth.

1094
00:56:17,875 --> 00:56:19,543
(door clicks)

1095
00:56:19,877 --> 00:56:20,511
Whoa.

1096
00:56:20,711 --> 00:56:21,637
(gun banging)

1097
00:56:21,837 --> 00:56:23,547
(program buzzing)

1098
00:56:23,881 --> 00:56:26,425
(body thuds)

1099
00:56:26,759 --> 00:56:27,894
(Nikki grunts)
(fist thuds)

1100
00:56:28,094 --> 00:56:29,353
Oh, god, I'm sorry.

1101
00:56:29,553 --> 00:56:30,438
Don't worry about it,
don't worry about it.

1102
00:56:30,638 --> 00:56:31,564
She's just part of the program.

1103
00:56:31,764 --> 00:56:33,617
Yeah, well, this part
of the program's deleted.

1104
00:56:33,641 --> 00:56:35,184
I'm a prisoner, too.

1105
00:56:39,522 --> 00:56:41,065
(gun banging)

1106
00:56:41,399 --> 00:56:42,699
Let's go!

1107
00:56:43,317 --> 00:56:47,780
(Montgomery yelling)
(guns banging)

1108
00:56:48,114 --> 00:56:50,866
[Heinz] Nice try, old man.

1109
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:52,418
(Montgomery chuckles)

1110
00:56:52,618 --> 00:56:55,496
(car engine roaring)

1111
00:56:58,165 --> 00:56:59,300
Come on, hurry up.

1112
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:02,378
(train horn blowing)

1113
00:57:03,421 --> 00:57:04,805
(slow tempo jazz music)

1114
00:57:05,005 --> 00:57:05,723
Let's go.

1115
00:57:05,923 --> 00:57:06,974
Keep moving.

1116
00:57:07,174 --> 00:57:09,552
(bell ringing)

1117
00:57:12,096 --> 00:57:14,682
(steam hissing)

1118
00:57:24,358 --> 00:57:27,361
(train horn blowing)

1119
00:57:29,238 --> 00:57:32,408
(train engine roaring)

1120
00:57:38,831 --> 00:57:42,543
Hey, how do we know you're
not one of Crowley's tricks?

1121
00:57:42,877 --> 00:57:44,177
We don't.

1122
00:57:49,884 --> 00:57:52,553
Look, my name is Nikki Pierce.

1123
00:57:52,887 --> 00:57:54,063
The eco warrior?

1124
00:57:54,263 --> 00:57:55,856
No, the convict.

1125
00:58:01,145 --> 00:58:03,731
All right, look, we gotta
remember these bastards

1126
00:58:04,064 --> 00:58:06,400
are in this for themselves.

1127
00:58:06,734 --> 00:58:08,694
We stick together, agreed?

1128
00:58:13,949 --> 00:58:17,620
(bell ringing)
(Montgomery laughing)

1129
00:58:17,953 --> 00:58:21,081
(slow tempo jazz music)

1130
00:58:37,890 --> 00:58:40,392
Whoa, whoa, whoa, play it cool.

1131
00:58:42,853 --> 00:58:44,488
We're in no rush.

1132
00:58:45,606 --> 00:58:48,734
I'm killing this bastard myself.

1133
00:58:49,068 --> 00:58:51,487
I told you, we work as a team.

1134
00:58:54,698 --> 00:58:56,700
Uh-uh, this one's mine.

1135
00:59:01,247 --> 00:59:03,666
(gun banging)

1136
00:59:04,708 --> 00:59:07,127
(gun banging)

1137
00:59:09,380 --> 00:59:10,306
(gun clicking)

1138
00:59:10,506 --> 00:59:11,474
Shit, she's in trouble.

1139
00:59:11,674 --> 00:59:13,100
Hold on, hold on.

1140
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:14,600
Be patient.

1141
00:59:15,719 --> 00:59:17,555
Let's see what he does.

1142
00:59:19,056 --> 00:59:19,940
(Heinz grunts)

1143
00:59:20,140 --> 00:59:22,059
(Nikki groaning)

1144
00:59:22,393 --> 00:59:23,894
Nikki Pierce.

1145
00:59:24,228 --> 00:59:28,399
My dear, once again, I'll
have my way with you.

1146
00:59:28,732 --> 00:59:31,193
But at least give me a smile, huh?

1147
00:59:31,527 --> 00:59:32,370
That's right, bitch.

1148
00:59:32,570 --> 00:59:34,163
(gun bangs)
(program buzzing)

1149
00:59:34,363 --> 00:59:37,157
(guns banging)

1150
00:59:37,491 --> 00:59:40,035
(Heinz groaning)

1151
00:59:41,704 --> 00:59:42,922
(group chattering)

1152
00:59:43,122 --> 00:59:46,250
(slow tempo jazz music)

1153
01:00:17,740 --> 01:00:19,825
May I punch your ticket?

1154
01:00:20,826 --> 01:00:23,621
(gun bangs)
(program buzzing)

1155
01:00:23,954 --> 01:00:25,831
(group chattering)

1156
01:00:26,165 --> 01:00:27,049
[Passenger] Is he dead?

1157
01:00:27,249 --> 01:00:28,634
- Oh, my god.
- Oh, my god.

1158
01:00:28,834 --> 01:00:31,420
(computer beeps)

1159
01:00:31,754 --> 01:00:34,465
You have a sick sense of humor, Crowley.

1160
01:00:34,798 --> 01:00:35,683
That bitch is mine.

1161
01:00:35,883 --> 01:00:38,177
(laughs) Don't count on it, sir.

1162
01:00:38,510 --> 01:00:39,728
I'm not kidding.

1163
01:00:39,928 --> 01:00:41,147
Stay out of my way.

1164
01:00:41,347 --> 01:00:45,726
My, my. The level of
competition is getting higher.

1165
01:00:46,060 --> 01:00:48,103
Well, I must say, that

1166
01:00:48,437 --> 01:00:51,148
Baracus is quite a sharp-witted fella.

1167
01:00:51,482 --> 01:00:54,193
I will take great pride
in slitting his throat.

1168
01:00:54,526 --> 01:00:55,995
You couldn't even shoot him,

1169
01:00:56,195 --> 01:00:57,821
what makes you think you could cut him?

1170
01:00:58,155 --> 01:01:00,699
Well, at least I wasn't gunned down

1171
01:01:01,033 --> 01:01:03,494
by that little tot right off the bat.

1172
01:01:03,827 --> 01:01:06,246
Enough talk, let's go back in the game.

1173
01:01:06,580 --> 01:01:07,673
[Daniel] Yes, right away.

1174
01:01:07,873 --> 01:01:10,250
Don't be impertinent, Daniel.

1175
01:01:14,797 --> 01:01:18,300
Now, there are four
prime trophies out there,

1176
01:01:18,634 --> 01:01:20,552
let's find out who the best man is.

1177
01:01:20,886 --> 01:01:24,014
(birds chirping)

1178
01:01:24,348 --> 01:01:27,601
(chattering in distance)

1179
01:01:27,935 --> 01:01:30,270
(gun clicking)

1180
01:01:43,701 --> 01:01:46,203
(gun clicking)

1181
01:01:48,914 --> 01:01:51,625
(dog barking)

1182
01:01:51,959 --> 01:01:53,052
(upbeat ragtime piano music)

1183
01:01:53,252 --> 01:01:54,386
(fist thuds)
(man groans)

1184
01:01:54,586 --> 01:01:56,797
(body thuds)

1185
01:01:59,925 --> 01:02:02,761
(group chattering)

1186
01:02:05,013 --> 01:02:06,065
Hey, cowboy.

1187
01:02:06,265 --> 01:02:09,518
I haven't seen you around here in a while.

1188
01:02:09,852 --> 01:02:10,861
How you been?

1189
01:02:11,061 --> 01:02:13,522
Hiya, darling. (chuckles)

1190
01:02:13,856 --> 01:02:15,649
It's good to see you, too.

1191
01:02:16,942 --> 01:02:20,404
[Charlie] Gentlemen,
the game's five card stud.

1192
01:02:20,738 --> 01:02:22,080
Nothing's wild.

1193
01:02:27,870 --> 01:02:29,663
Let me see your money on the table.

1194
01:02:29,997 --> 01:02:33,292
Remember, every hand's a
winner, every hand's a loser.

1195
01:02:33,625 --> 01:02:35,169
Make mine a winner there, Charlie,

1196
01:02:35,502 --> 01:02:36,929
if you know what's good for you.

1197
01:02:37,129 --> 01:02:39,923
[Charlie] Yes, sir, Mr.
James, I'll try my best.

1198
01:02:40,257 --> 01:02:41,557
You know it.

1199
01:02:50,601 --> 01:02:52,227
[Will] Throw 'em down.

1200
01:02:52,561 --> 01:02:53,362
[Stu] Read 'em and weep.

1201
01:02:53,562 --> 01:02:54,530
[Charlie] A winning hand.

1202
01:02:54,730 --> 01:02:57,232
(hand thuds)

1203
01:02:57,566 --> 01:02:59,943
You know, Frank, I don't think

1204
01:03:00,277 --> 01:03:04,239
I could take lucky boy
here winning another hand.

1205
01:03:04,573 --> 01:03:07,284
Jesse don't like
losing before a robbery.

1206
01:03:07,618 --> 01:03:10,621
I'm sure you got a winning
hand coming up here soon.

1207
01:03:10,954 --> 01:03:12,915
[Charlie] Ante up, boys.

1208
01:03:29,097 --> 01:03:31,350
[Man] Beat that, greenhorn.

1209
01:03:33,936 --> 01:03:36,021
Let's see 'em, tenderfoot.

1210
01:03:37,189 --> 01:03:38,657
[Man 2] Call.

1211
01:03:39,358 --> 01:03:42,402
I think Crowley's dealing these hands.

1212
01:03:42,736 --> 01:03:44,079
[Man 2] Call.

1213
01:03:46,865 --> 01:03:48,166
Damn right.

1214
01:03:49,243 --> 01:03:50,002
I fold.

1215
01:03:50,202 --> 01:03:53,455
(upbeat music)
(group chattering)

1216
01:03:53,789 --> 01:03:55,382
Well, all right.

1217
01:03:56,875 --> 01:03:58,510
Now I feel lucky.

1218
01:04:01,630 --> 01:04:02,389
(glass thuds)

1219
01:04:02,589 --> 01:04:05,843
[Cole] Goddammit, boys,
let's get down to it.

1220
01:04:06,176 --> 01:04:08,136
(birds chirping)

1221
01:04:08,470 --> 01:04:10,751
[Will] I think that's the
Jesse James/Cole Younger gang.

1222
01:04:10,973 --> 01:04:12,191
I say we stick with them.

1223
01:04:12,391 --> 01:04:14,893
Best bodyguards we're gonna find.

1224
01:04:19,523 --> 01:04:22,192
(horse neighing)

1225
01:04:25,362 --> 01:04:28,282
(suspenseful music)
(gun clicking)

1226
01:04:28,615 --> 01:04:30,343
All right, boys, you
know what we're here for.

1227
01:04:30,367 --> 01:04:31,667
Let's do it.

1228
01:04:33,328 --> 01:04:34,628
Come on.

1229
01:04:46,300 --> 01:04:48,260
(horse neighing)

1230
01:04:48,594 --> 01:04:50,113
[Driver] All right,
folks, this is Northfield,

1231
01:04:50,137 --> 01:04:50,771
end of the line.

1232
01:04:50,971 --> 01:04:52,271
Northfield.

1233
01:04:53,348 --> 01:04:54,775
Oh, shit.

1234
01:04:54,975 --> 01:04:56,560
[Stu] What is it?

1235
01:04:56,894 --> 01:04:57,861
I'm afraid the James boys

1236
01:04:58,061 --> 01:04:59,938
didn't turn out too good on this one.

1237
01:05:00,272 --> 01:05:00,989
[Man] They're robbing the bank!

1238
01:05:01,189 --> 01:05:02,741
(gun bangs)

1239
01:05:02,941 --> 01:05:03,575
(gun bangs)

1240
01:05:03,775 --> 01:05:04,576
(gun banging)

1241
01:05:04,776 --> 01:05:05,994
(man groans)
(body thuds)

1242
01:05:06,194 --> 01:05:07,287
(woman screams)
(man yelling)

1243
01:05:07,487 --> 01:05:09,823
(guns banging)

1244
01:05:10,782 --> 01:05:13,702
(body thuds)

1245
01:05:14,036 --> 01:05:16,330
(gun banging)

1246
01:05:19,291 --> 01:05:20,792
(gun bangs)
(gun clicking)

1247
01:05:21,126 --> 01:05:22,920
(man yelling)

1248
01:05:23,253 --> 01:05:25,714
(woman screams)

1249
01:05:27,174 --> 01:05:28,642
Hey, Sheriff!

1250
01:05:30,010 --> 01:05:34,932
(gun bangs)
(program buzzing)

1251
01:05:35,724 --> 01:05:37,643
(computer beeps)

1252
01:05:37,976 --> 01:05:39,276
Scheiße.

1253
01:05:40,479 --> 01:05:42,189
What's happening, Crowley?

1254
01:05:42,522 --> 01:05:43,198
I don't pay this kind of money

1255
01:05:43,398 --> 01:05:45,359
to be cut down by Jesse James.

1256
01:05:45,692 --> 01:05:49,071
If you remember, you
helped make the rules.

1257
01:05:49,404 --> 01:05:51,990
Are you not majority
shareholder of Crowley Games?

1258
01:05:52,324 --> 01:05:54,242
Precisely, which you should keep

1259
01:05:54,576 --> 01:05:57,120
in mind for the next scenario.

1260
01:05:57,454 --> 01:05:59,831
I'm getting sick and tired of your tricks.

1261
01:06:00,165 --> 01:06:03,126
Perhaps you should hone your skills.

1262
01:06:04,252 --> 01:06:05,429
Schwein.

1263
01:06:05,629 --> 01:06:07,714
(gun banging)
(birds chirping)

1264
01:06:08,048 --> 01:06:09,183
There's Stu.

1265
01:06:09,383 --> 01:06:10,642
Cover him.

1266
01:06:10,842 --> 01:06:12,436
(gun bangs)

1267
01:06:12,636 --> 01:06:13,729
(gun clicks)

1268
01:06:13,929 --> 01:06:14,813
(gun bangs)

1269
01:06:15,013 --> 01:06:16,064
(gun clicks)

1270
01:06:16,264 --> 01:06:17,274
(gun bangs)

1271
01:06:17,474 --> 01:06:18,734
(gun clicks)

1272
01:06:18,934 --> 01:06:20,277
(gun bangs)

1273
01:06:20,477 --> 01:06:21,737
(gun bangs)

1274
01:06:21,937 --> 01:06:24,481
There's better cover in the barn.

1275
01:06:28,360 --> 01:06:29,536
[Stu] I don't get it.

1276
01:06:29,736 --> 01:06:33,782
How did you know what was
gonna go down that day?

1277
01:06:34,116 --> 01:06:36,410
Once again, Crowley
was true to his word.

1278
01:06:36,743 --> 01:06:40,288
This is an authentic historical scenario.

1279
01:06:40,622 --> 01:06:43,125
Great Northfield, Minnesota Raid.

1280
01:06:44,418 --> 01:06:45,427
Nikki, you move up front.

1281
01:06:45,627 --> 01:06:46,261
Stu, you take the back.

1282
01:06:46,461 --> 01:06:48,463
Be careful.
- Gotcha.

1283
01:06:48,797 --> 01:06:51,591
(suspenseful music)

1284
01:07:01,476 --> 01:07:05,647
Now, it's been a long
time since I've had a woman.

1285
01:07:06,565 --> 01:07:09,526
Especially one as beautiful as you are.

1286
01:07:09,860 --> 01:07:12,654
There's no time for this shit, Baracus.

1287
01:07:12,988 --> 01:07:14,948
I will kill you.

1288
01:07:15,282 --> 01:07:16,992
You're gonna have to.

1289
01:07:21,038 --> 01:07:21,797
(gun bangs)

1290
01:07:21,997 --> 01:07:24,124
(gun bangs)

1291
01:07:25,584 --> 01:07:26,885
Quiet.

1292
01:07:27,085 --> 01:07:29,337
(gun banging)

1293
01:07:30,756 --> 01:07:32,758
(Nikki and Baracus grunting)

1294
01:07:33,091 --> 01:07:34,434
(Baracus grunting)

1295
01:07:34,634 --> 01:07:36,762
(gun bangs)

1296
01:07:37,095 --> 01:07:39,681
(gun bangs)

1297
01:07:40,015 --> 01:07:41,850
(gun bangs)

1298
01:07:42,184 --> 01:07:43,935
I want you to be real quiet,

1299
01:07:44,269 --> 01:07:46,730
because this thing can go off.

1300
01:07:47,064 --> 01:07:50,108
And you know, really, it don't
make much difference to me

1301
01:07:50,442 --> 01:07:54,071
right now whether you're
dead or you're alive.

1302
01:07:54,404 --> 01:07:55,989
(gun bangs)

1303
01:07:56,323 --> 01:07:57,499
(gun bangs)

1304
01:07:57,699 --> 01:07:59,126
Now quiet.

1305
01:07:59,326 --> 01:07:59,960
(Nikki whimpering)

1306
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:01,211
(guns banging)

1307
01:08:01,411 --> 01:08:02,954
(Nikki whimpering)

1308
01:08:03,288 --> 01:08:04,464
(gun bangs)

1309
01:08:04,664 --> 01:08:06,166
(gun bangs)

1310
01:08:06,500 --> 01:08:08,835
(gun banging)

1311
01:08:09,169 --> 01:08:09,803
(gun bangs)

1312
01:08:10,003 --> 01:08:10,637
(Nikki grunts)

1313
01:08:10,837 --> 01:08:11,471
(gun bangs)

1314
01:08:11,671 --> 01:08:12,306
(Nikki grunts)

1315
01:08:12,506 --> 01:08:13,557
(guns banging)

1316
01:08:13,757 --> 01:08:14,391
(Nikki grunts)

1317
01:08:14,591 --> 01:08:17,385
(guns banging)

1318
01:08:17,719 --> 01:08:18,854
(gun bangs)

1319
01:08:19,054 --> 01:08:20,355
(gun bangs)

1320
01:08:20,555 --> 01:08:21,855
Get off her.

1321
01:08:24,184 --> 01:08:27,145
Now drop the gun, real slow.

1322
01:08:27,479 --> 01:08:29,773
(dog barking)

1323
01:08:31,274 --> 01:08:33,443
(gun thuds)

1324
01:08:33,777 --> 01:08:35,904
The one in your holster, too.

1325
01:08:40,200 --> 01:08:41,500
Oh, Will,

1326
01:08:41,993 --> 01:08:42,753
(gun thuds)

1327
01:08:42,953 --> 01:08:44,913
you're such a hero.

1328
01:08:45,247 --> 01:08:47,249
(gun bangs)

1329
01:08:47,582 --> 01:08:48,592
(gun bangs)

1330
01:08:48,792 --> 01:08:51,211
[Will] Get over here, Baracus.

1331
01:08:51,545 --> 01:08:52,763
(gun bangs)

1332
01:08:52,963 --> 01:08:54,965
Forgetting something?

1333
01:08:55,298 --> 01:08:57,425
(gun bangs)

1334
01:08:58,593 --> 01:09:01,429
(gun clicks)

1335
01:09:01,763 --> 01:09:03,315
[Stu] Will, I need ammo.

1336
01:09:03,515 --> 01:09:04,316
(metal clangs)
(Will grunts)

1337
01:09:04,516 --> 01:09:07,144
(arm whooshes)
(Will grunts)

1338
01:09:09,688 --> 01:09:13,024
(arm whooshes)
(Baracus grunts)

1339
01:09:13,358 --> 01:09:14,785
(knife whooshes)
(Baracus grunts)

1340
01:09:14,985 --> 01:09:15,994
(knife whooshes)
(Baracus grunts)

1341
01:09:16,194 --> 01:09:19,030
(knife whooshing)

1342
01:09:19,364 --> 01:09:21,032
(Baracus grunting)
(knife whooshing)

1343
01:09:21,366 --> 01:09:23,493
(Baracus grunting)
(knife whooshing)

1344
01:09:23,827 --> 01:09:24,962
(Baracus grunting)

1345
01:09:25,162 --> 01:09:27,789
(knife whooshing)

1346
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:31,501
(knife whooshes)
(Baracus grunting)

1347
01:09:31,835 --> 01:09:32,928
(knife whooshing)

1348
01:09:33,128 --> 01:09:35,839
(Baracus grunting)

1349
01:09:37,090 --> 01:09:38,350
(knife whooshes)
(Baracus grunting)

1350
01:09:38,550 --> 01:09:41,636
(knives clanging)

1351
01:09:41,970 --> 01:09:43,188
(knife whooshing)
(Baracus grunts)

1352
01:09:43,388 --> 01:09:46,683
(knife whooshing)
(Baracus grunting)

1353
01:09:47,017 --> 01:09:49,227
(gun clicks)

1354
01:09:50,562 --> 01:09:53,315
Now, Nikki, you know you need me.

1355
01:09:54,316 --> 01:09:55,450
(gun bangs)
(program buzzing)

1356
01:09:55,650 --> 01:09:58,320
(Baracus groaning)

1357
01:10:00,739 --> 01:10:02,249
(body thuds)

1358
01:10:02,449 --> 01:10:04,001
(Baracus groans)
(body thuds)

1359
01:10:04,201 --> 01:10:06,411
(birds chirping)

1360
01:10:06,745 --> 01:10:09,122
(gun clicking)

1361
01:10:10,498 --> 01:10:12,167
Nice shooting, Colonel.

1362
01:10:12,500 --> 01:10:14,544
That was fucking pathetic.

1363
01:10:14,878 --> 01:10:16,346
Oh, and you're one to talk.

1364
01:10:16,546 --> 01:10:19,049
Twenty feet away with
a goddamn scatter gun.

1365
01:10:19,382 --> 01:10:20,600
Couldn't hit the broad side of a barn

1366
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:21,768
if it landed on you.

1367
01:10:21,968 --> 01:10:22,936
Don't bother finishing.

1368
01:10:23,136 --> 01:10:24,812
I'm already loaded.

1369
01:10:26,598 --> 01:10:27,774
Stu, toss me the rifle.

1370
01:10:27,974 --> 01:10:29,526
(Stu grunts)

1371
01:10:29,726 --> 01:10:31,603
(gun clicking)

1372
01:10:31,937 --> 01:10:33,613
Let's go over here.

1373
01:10:36,650 --> 01:10:38,985
(gun clicks)

1374
01:10:45,325 --> 01:10:47,535
What happened down there?

1375
01:10:47,869 --> 01:10:49,379
Baracus is out.

1376
01:10:49,579 --> 01:10:51,414
Yeah, I could see that.

1377
01:10:59,005 --> 01:10:59,765
(gun bangs)
(Daniel groans)

1378
01:10:59,965 --> 01:11:00,766
(program buzzing)

1379
01:11:00,966 --> 01:11:01,725
(gun bangs)
(Daniel groans)

1380
01:11:01,925 --> 01:11:03,885
Now, I'm reloaded.

1381
01:11:04,219 --> 01:11:06,513
(gun bangs)

1382
01:11:06,846 --> 01:11:08,348
[Stu] Who shot Traven?

1383
01:11:08,682 --> 01:11:09,900
One of the hunters.

1384
01:11:10,100 --> 01:11:11,851
Look, things are getting ugly.

1385
01:11:12,185 --> 01:11:12,819
I'm gonna check out the back.

1386
01:11:13,019 --> 01:11:15,689
Keep your eyes open up front.

1387
01:11:16,022 --> 01:11:20,819
(sighs) Well, this sure beats
sitting in a cell all day.

1388
01:11:24,656 --> 01:11:27,617
(guns banging)

1389
01:11:27,951 --> 01:11:29,995
Mind if I ask you a question?

1390
01:11:30,328 --> 01:11:31,671
Depends.

1391
01:11:31,871 --> 01:11:34,416
(gun bangs)

1392
01:11:34,749 --> 01:11:35,467
What are you in for?

1393
01:11:35,667 --> 01:11:38,044
(gun clicking)

1394
01:11:40,297 --> 01:11:42,340
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have asked.

1395
01:11:42,674 --> 01:11:44,226
It's all right.

1396
01:11:44,426 --> 01:11:45,560
(gun bangs)

1397
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:47,270
(gun clicking)

1398
01:11:47,470 --> 01:11:49,723
I almost killed someone.

1399
01:11:50,056 --> 01:11:51,599
(gun bangs)

1400
01:11:51,933 --> 01:11:53,276
What happened?

1401
01:11:53,476 --> 01:11:54,236
(gun bangs)

1402
01:11:54,436 --> 01:11:55,070
(ominous music)

1403
01:11:55,270 --> 01:11:56,571
I had just finished this investigation

1404
01:11:56,771 --> 01:11:59,607
for the Earth Health Organization,
which was gonna expose

1405
01:11:59,941 --> 01:12:02,277
the entire nuclear energy
industry in Germany.

1406
01:12:02,610 --> 01:12:03,495
(thunder rumbling)

1407
01:12:03,695 --> 01:12:06,239
And the strangest thing happened.

1408
01:12:08,074 --> 01:12:09,617
I was home that evening working

1409
01:12:09,951 --> 01:12:13,496
when the man behind the entire
nuclear proliferation cover-up

1410
01:12:13,830 --> 01:12:16,666
just barged into my apartment.

1411
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:20,462
He said he wanted to congratulate
me on a job well done.

1412
01:12:20,795 --> 01:12:22,380
(hand slaps)
(Nikki groans)

1413
01:12:22,714 --> 01:12:23,890
Everything was destroyed.

1414
01:12:24,090 --> 01:12:24,933
(hand slaps)
(Nikki groans)

1415
01:12:25,133 --> 01:12:27,927
My reports, my notes were all burnt.

1416
01:12:28,261 --> 01:12:30,263
Everything was gone.

1417
01:12:30,597 --> 01:12:32,390
Everything I worked for.

1418
01:12:33,808 --> 01:12:36,478
(Nikki groaning)

1419
01:12:43,860 --> 01:12:44,870
(thunder rumbling)

1420
01:12:45,070 --> 01:12:46,370
He raped me.

1421
01:12:47,572 --> 01:12:48,582
Jesus.

1422
01:12:48,782 --> 01:12:49,916
(birds chirping)

1423
01:12:50,116 --> 01:12:51,542
What did you do?

1424
01:12:52,202 --> 01:12:54,079
I went to his office.

1425
01:12:54,412 --> 01:12:55,839
I don't exactly what happened.

1426
01:12:56,039 --> 01:12:57,832
I just went crazy.

1427
01:12:58,166 --> 01:12:59,846
By the time security pulled me off of him,

1428
01:12:59,876 --> 01:13:04,547
I had already fractured his
skull and broken his spine.

1429
01:13:04,881 --> 01:13:06,758
He was crippled for life.

1430
01:13:08,635 --> 01:13:10,637
But that was justified.

1431
01:13:10,970 --> 01:13:11,980
He deserved it.

1432
01:13:12,180 --> 01:13:14,474
That man was Heinz Dietrich.

1433
01:13:15,558 --> 01:13:17,152
Nobody believed me.

1434
01:13:17,352 --> 01:13:19,112
I believe you.

1435
01:13:22,232 --> 01:13:25,026
You gotta check this guy out.

1436
01:13:25,360 --> 01:13:26,660
Be careful.

1437
01:13:28,154 --> 01:13:30,532
Will Singleton.

1438
01:13:32,826 --> 01:13:36,663
I could wait you out, but
that would get boring.

1439
01:13:37,622 --> 01:13:39,249
And it'd be downright foolhardy of me

1440
01:13:39,582 --> 01:13:43,920
to come barging in there,
numbers being what they are.

1441
01:13:44,254 --> 01:13:48,133
So I suggest that we just
throw down the hardware

1442
01:13:51,386 --> 01:13:54,472
and settle this the old fashioned way.

1443
01:13:55,598 --> 01:13:56,524
(knife whooshing)

1444
01:13:56,724 --> 01:13:58,024
Hand-to-hand.

1445
01:13:58,685 --> 01:14:03,064
One... two... three.

1446
01:14:03,398 --> 01:14:04,115
(guns banging)

1447
01:14:04,315 --> 01:14:05,942
(program buzzing)

1448
01:14:06,276 --> 01:14:10,780
(body thuds)
(ominous music)

1449
01:14:11,114 --> 01:14:11,915
What an asshole.

1450
01:14:12,115 --> 01:14:13,041
(computer beeps)

1451
01:14:13,241 --> 01:14:14,668
That is enough!

1452
01:14:14,868 --> 01:14:16,619
That man has no honor!

1453
01:14:16,953 --> 01:14:18,253
No honor?

1454
01:14:18,746 --> 01:14:21,708
You shot me in the back, you bastard.

1455
01:14:22,041 --> 01:14:26,296
Gentlemen, you should save
your energy for the game.

1456
01:14:26,629 --> 01:14:29,174
You must be extremely
dismayed, Mr. Valentine.

1457
01:14:29,507 --> 01:14:31,184
A waste of Baracus.

1458
01:14:31,926 --> 01:14:34,721
That, sir, is an outrage.

1459
01:14:35,054 --> 01:14:36,564
That is unacceptable.

1460
01:14:36,764 --> 01:14:39,017
I paid for the privilege
of killing these animals,

1461
01:14:39,350 --> 01:14:41,269
not watching them take out their own.

1462
01:14:41,603 --> 01:14:44,230
I demand you put that man back in.

1463
01:14:47,734 --> 01:14:50,320
I shall appease you this once.

1464
01:14:51,279 --> 01:14:52,706
(guns banging)

1465
01:14:52,906 --> 01:14:54,332
(explosion booming)

1466
01:14:54,532 --> 01:14:55,834
(missile whistling)

1467
01:14:56,034 --> 01:14:57,585
(explosion booming)

1468
01:14:57,785 --> 01:15:00,163
(guns banging)

1469
01:15:01,539 --> 01:15:04,918
(explosion booming)

1470
01:15:05,251 --> 01:15:05,885
(gun banging)

1471
01:15:06,085 --> 01:15:06,761
(cannon booming)

1472
01:15:06,961 --> 01:15:09,255
(explosion booming)
(metal crashing)

1473
01:15:09,589 --> 01:15:11,099
(glass shattering)

1474
01:15:11,299 --> 01:15:12,642
(cannon booming)

1475
01:15:12,842 --> 01:15:14,719
(guns banging)
(cannon booming)

1476
01:15:15,053 --> 01:15:15,687
(cannon booming)

1477
01:15:15,887 --> 01:15:17,430
(explosion booming)

1478
01:15:17,764 --> 01:15:18,565
(tank engine roaring)

1479
01:15:18,765 --> 01:15:20,065
Will, look!

1480
01:15:21,142 --> 01:15:22,485
We're goddamn Nazis!

1481
01:15:22,685 --> 01:15:24,479
(cannon booms)

1482
01:15:24,812 --> 01:15:25,488
(gun banging)

1483
01:15:25,688 --> 01:15:26,323
(cannon booms)

1484
01:15:26,523 --> 01:15:27,657
Stu, check your ammo.

1485
01:15:27,857 --> 01:15:29,526
Nikki, check your ammo.

1486
01:15:31,569 --> 01:15:33,071
Give me that.

1487
01:15:35,990 --> 01:15:37,290
Nothing!

1488
01:15:37,825 --> 01:15:41,079
This must be the end of the war, 1945.

1489
01:15:41,412 --> 01:15:45,041
The Third Reich, it's
crumbling down all around.

1490
01:15:45,375 --> 01:15:47,669
(gun banging)

1491
01:15:50,797 --> 01:15:53,299
At this point, the Nazi
ranks were devastated.

1492
01:15:53,633 --> 01:15:54,726
Take a look at those kids.

1493
01:15:54,926 --> 01:15:55,560
They're starving.

1494
01:15:55,760 --> 01:15:58,805
They got no food, no
supplies, not even ammo.

1495
01:15:59,138 --> 01:16:00,357
(cannon booms)

1496
01:16:00,557 --> 01:16:01,316
[Stu] Pretty cold, too.

1497
01:16:01,516 --> 01:16:02,359
Yeah.

1498
01:16:02,559 --> 01:16:04,686
Hundreds of thousands froze to death.

1499
01:16:05,019 --> 01:16:06,613
You better give her that.

1500
01:16:06,813 --> 01:16:08,113
Here.

1501
01:16:08,982 --> 01:16:10,608
I can take it, dammit.

1502
01:16:10,942 --> 01:16:13,403
Ooh, how much can you take, Nikki?

1503
01:16:16,948 --> 01:16:18,583
Son of a bitch.

1504
01:16:20,827 --> 01:16:24,289
Killed you once, Baracus,
we can do it again.

1505
01:16:24,622 --> 01:16:26,666
Look, I know it seems like
we can pretty much handle

1506
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:28,835
whatever they throw at us,

1507
01:16:29,168 --> 01:16:31,588
but we're gonna be trapped
in this virtual hell

1508
01:16:31,921 --> 01:16:34,549
until we find a way out of the program.

1509
01:16:34,882 --> 01:16:35,517
You got that?

1510
01:16:35,717 --> 01:16:37,060
(guns banging)

1511
01:16:37,260 --> 01:16:40,930
Please, can we try to just
stick together 'til that time?

1512
01:16:41,264 --> 01:16:43,308
Ooh, I promise to be good

1513
01:16:46,811 --> 01:16:50,273
until we're through with this one.

1514
01:16:50,607 --> 01:16:52,117
(bullets whooshing)

1515
01:16:52,317 --> 01:16:52,992
(cannon booming)

1516
01:16:53,192 --> 01:16:55,987
(explosion booming)
(bullets whooshing)

1517
01:16:56,321 --> 01:17:00,033

1530
01:17:28,686 --> 01:17:29,946
(explosion booming)

1531
01:17:30,146 --> 01:17:31,981
(Heinz laughing)

1532
01:17:32,315 --> 01:17:32,949
(explosion booming)

1533
01:17:33,149 --> 01:17:34,576

(explosion booming)

1538
01:17:44,410 --> 01:17:47,372
(Heinz speaking in German)

1539
01:17:47,705 --> 01:17:48,548
(gun bangs)
(man groaning)

1540
01:17:48,748 --> 01:17:49,382
(speaking in German)

1541
01:17:49,582 --> 01:17:54,128
(gun bangs)
(man groans)

1542
01:17:55,421 --> 01:17:57,507
(cannon booming)

1543
01:17:57,840 --> 01:18:00,802
(tank engine roaring)

1544
01:18:01,135 --> 01:18:02,145
(cannon booms)
(explosion booming)

1545
01:18:02,345 --> 01:18:04,555

01:18:04,889 --> 01:18:07,266
(fire roaring)

1547
01:18:09,894 --> 01:18:13,147
(explosion booming)

1548
01:18:13,481 --> 01:18:18,277
(suspenseful music)
(man gurgling)

1549
01:18:19,112 --> 01:18:22,281
(fuse hissing)

1550
01:18:22,615 --> 01:18:24,992
(metal clangs)

01:18:29,330 --> 01:18:31,457
(explosion booming)
(guns banging)

1552
01:18:31,791 --> 01:18:34,794
(dramatic music)
(Nikki groaning)

1553
01:18:35,128 --> 01:18:36,095
(ominous music)

1554
01:18:36,295 --> 01:18:37,263
She's been shot.

1555
01:18:37,463 --> 01:18:39,590
We have to do something.
- God.

1556
01:18:39,924 --> 01:18:41,351
This feels real.

1557
01:18:41,551 --> 01:18:43,151
We have to get her out of the program.

1558
01:18:43,177 --> 01:18:44,187
Shut up, I know, let me think.

1559
01:18:44,387 --> 01:18:45,271
(tank engines roaring)

1560
01:18:45,471 --> 01:18:46,523
(Nikki groaning)

1561
01:18:46,723 --> 01:18:49,642
Dammit, there was no way for
the Nazis to win this battle.

1562
01:18:49,976 --> 01:18:52,145
They were outgunned, outmanned,

1563
01:18:52,478 --> 01:18:54,480
yet their commanders forced the fight on.

1564
01:18:54,814 --> 01:18:56,482
Absolutely no surrender.

1565
01:18:56,816 --> 01:18:59,819
We're gonna have to do
something to change that.

1566
01:19:00,153 --> 01:19:04,949
(guns banging)
(group yelling)

1567
01:19:08,953 --> 01:19:11,664

(man speaking in German)

1570
01:19:18,171 --> 01:19:20,882
(group chattering)

1571
01:19:23,509 --> 01:19:24,477
All right, look, let's try

1572
01:19:24,677 --> 01:19:26,104
and get her to a field hospital.

1573
01:19:26,304 --> 01:19:28,848
But remember, we can always
surrender to American forces.

1574
01:19:29,182 --> 01:19:31,058
Why don't we surrender to the Russians?

1575
01:19:31,392 --> 01:19:32,443
What? Are you kidding me?

1576
01:19:32,643 --> 01:19:33,736
The Russians took no prisoners.

1577
01:19:33,936 --> 01:19:34,904
They'd massacre us.

1578
01:19:35,104 --> 01:19:35,780
Come on, let's go.

1579
01:19:35,980 --> 01:19:38,775
(explosion booming)

1580
01:19:40,985 --> 01:19:42,370
(Nikki groaning)
(cannon booming)

1581
01:19:42,570 --> 01:19:44,530
(explosion booming)
(water splashing)

1582
01:19:44,864 --> 01:19:45,873
Come on, boys, double time.

1583
01:19:46,073 --> 01:19:49,786
[Group] Hup, hup, hup, hup, hup, hup.

1584
01:19:50,119 --> 01:19:52,246
Hang on, Nikki, we'll get
you to a field hospital.

1585
01:19:52,580 --> 01:19:53,965
(suspenseful music)

1586
01:19:54,165 --> 01:19:55,675
(cannon booms)
(explosion booming)

1587
01:19:55,875 --> 01:19:56,843
Halt, stop!

1588
01:19:57,043 --> 01:19:59,003
We've got wounded.

1589
01:19:59,337 --> 01:20:01,339
Don't move, I mean it.

1590
01:20:01,672 --> 01:20:02,932
Hang on, Nikki, it's gonna be okay.

1591
01:20:03,132 --> 01:20:04,434
I've got you.

1592
01:20:04,634 --> 01:20:06,427
[Solider] I surrender.

1593
01:20:07,637 --> 01:20:09,514
Okay, hurry up, get her in.

1594
01:20:09,847 --> 01:20:11,147
Hurry.

1595
01:20:12,099 --> 01:20:15,102
(explosions booming)

1596
01:20:17,230 --> 01:20:19,816
(group yelling)

1597
01:20:25,738 --> 01:20:27,040
Medic, come on, we need room.

1598
01:20:27,240 --> 01:20:28,124
We got wounded here.
- We need help!

1599
01:20:28,324 --> 01:20:30,010
We need help!
- We need... come on, come on.

1600
01:20:30,034 --> 01:20:30,710
Bring a stretcher.

1601
01:20:30,910 --> 01:20:31,753
Let's go, let's go!

1602
01:20:31,953 --> 01:20:33,004
- We'll take over from here.
- Come on!

1603
01:20:33,204 --> 01:20:34,848
- We got this, we got this.
- Double quick time.

1604
01:20:34,872 --> 01:20:35,882
Let's go.
- All right, we got this.

1605
01:20:36,082 --> 01:20:37,750
(group chattering)

1606
01:20:38,084 --> 01:20:40,378
All right, get a surgeon, get a surgeon.

1607
01:20:40,711 --> 01:20:41,763
- Right through here.
- All right, we got it.

1608
01:20:41,963 --> 01:20:44,674
(group chattering)

1609
01:20:48,344 --> 01:20:49,771
Medic, we got wounded here.

1610
01:20:49,971 --> 01:20:50,730
You wanna help us?

1611
01:20:50,930 --> 01:20:52,398
She's dying.
- Wait a minute,

1612
01:20:52,598 --> 01:20:54,192
you guys sound American.

1613
01:20:54,392 --> 01:20:57,270
Look, we're dogfaces in kraut uniforms.

1614
01:20:57,603 --> 01:20:59,355
Now, get to work!

1615
01:20:59,689 --> 01:21:02,191
(man chattering)

1616
01:21:06,112 --> 01:21:07,923
[Solider] Hold him down,
dammit, hold him down.

1617
01:21:07,947 --> 01:21:11,367
[Medic] Stop the
bleeding, stop the bleeding.

1618
01:21:11,701 --> 01:21:12,877
(group chattering)

1619
01:21:13,077 --> 01:21:15,621
(Nikki groaning)

1620
01:21:16,706 --> 01:21:19,584
(Nikki groaning)

1621
01:21:19,917 --> 01:21:20,802
High fracture, stop the bleeding.

1622
01:21:21,002 --> 01:21:23,671
(Nikki groaning)

1623
01:21:24,005 --> 01:21:25,264
[Medic 2] I need
plasma over here, dammit!

1624
01:21:25,464 --> 01:21:26,933
I need plasma!

1625
01:21:27,133 --> 01:21:28,184
(group chattering)

1626
01:21:28,384 --> 01:21:29,945
There's not much I
can do, she's gutshot,

1627
01:21:29,969 --> 01:21:32,346
it's just a matter of time.

1628
01:21:32,680 --> 01:21:35,641
I gotta go work on someone I can save.

1629
01:21:36,642 --> 01:21:37,694
[Medic 2] Tighten that tourniquet.

1630
01:21:37,894 --> 01:21:39,236
Too much blood.

1631
01:21:40,938 --> 01:21:43,691
[Soldier] We got more wounded.

1632
01:21:44,025 --> 01:21:45,034
I've always believed there's a way out

1633
01:21:45,234 --> 01:21:46,794
of anything if you put your mind to it.

1634
01:21:46,861 --> 01:21:47,662
[Stu] I agree.

1635
01:21:47,862 --> 01:21:49,122
Look at her, she's done.

1636
01:21:49,322 --> 01:21:52,074
We're not gonna forget about her.

1637
01:21:52,408 --> 01:21:54,368
Hold on, hold on.

1638
01:21:54,702 --> 01:21:56,245
Anomalies, all right?

1639
01:21:56,579 --> 01:21:57,880
There are anomalies in the program.

1640
01:21:58,080 --> 01:21:58,715
What do you mean?

1641
01:21:58,915 --> 01:21:59,549
(Nikki groans)

1642
01:21:59,749 --> 01:22:00,842
Like when you killed the Nazi commander.

1643
01:22:01,042 --> 01:22:03,044
- ASAP, let's go.
- Yeah, the program froze

1644
01:22:03,377 --> 01:22:05,129
like it was trying to adapt.

1645
01:22:05,463 --> 01:22:06,597
Catch up or something.

1646
01:22:06,797 --> 01:22:08,549
(Nikki groaning)

1647
01:22:08,883 --> 01:22:10,676
It needs time to reboot itself.

1648
01:22:11,010 --> 01:22:12,019
So?

1649
01:22:12,219 --> 01:22:13,771
Why does it do that?

1650
01:22:13,971 --> 01:22:15,106
Too much information to process?

1651
01:22:15,306 --> 01:22:16,891
[Medic] We gotta stop the bleeding.

1652
01:22:17,224 --> 01:22:19,435
Too much information, maybe.

1653
01:22:20,770 --> 01:22:21,988
I say we give it more information

1654
01:22:22,188 --> 01:22:23,448
than it could ever handle.

1655
01:22:23,648 --> 01:22:25,232
Bring it all crashing down.

1656
01:22:25,566 --> 01:22:27,068
(Nikki groaning)

1657
01:22:27,401 --> 01:22:28,453
Okay.

1658
01:22:28,653 --> 01:22:30,293
Don't worry, Nikki, I'll be back for you.

1659
01:22:30,571 --> 01:22:31,956
Come on.

1660
01:22:32,156 --> 01:22:33,374
(suspenseful music)

1661
01:22:33,574 --> 01:22:35,168

1671
01:22:54,428 --> 01:22:55,972

(man groaning)

1679
01:23:11,112 --> 01:23:12,121
[Solider] Drop your weapons!

1680
01:23:12,321 --> 01:23:13,831
(gun banging)
(man groaning)

1681
01:23:14,031 --> 01:23:15,658

(Montgomery grunting)

1683
01:23:17,868 --> 01:23:19,537
What the hell is your problem?

1684
01:23:19,870 --> 01:23:22,039
It's me, Valentine, you dope!

1685
01:23:22,373 --> 01:23:23,958
(cannon bangs)

1686
01:23:24,291 --> 01:23:25,591
I know.

1687
01:23:26,502 --> 01:23:28,629
Who do you think you are?

1688
01:23:28,963 --> 01:23:30,840
I won't let you cheat me!

1689
01:23:32,883 --> 01:23:35,553
Cut it out, you two jackanapes!

1690
01:23:36,762 --> 01:23:39,140
They found a way to
overload Crowley's program.

1691
01:23:39,473 --> 01:23:41,150
We gotta stop them.

1692
01:23:44,061 --> 01:23:44,987

1693
01:23:45,187 --> 01:23:48,065

Come on.

1724
01:25:49,645 --> 01:25:50,945
You're mine.

1725
01:25:56,318 --> 01:25:59,238
You don't have the balls, Singleton.

1745
01:27:06,597 --> 01:27:07,481
Heads up.

(laughing) Yes!

(implant beeps)

1758
01:27:53,769 --> 01:27:55,288
[Will] Let's go, we're
out of the program!

1759
01:27:55,312 --> 01:27:58,440
(Heinz screaming)

1760
01:27:58,774 --> 01:27:59,784
Nikki, look out!

1761
01:27:59,984 --> 01:28:01,735
(sword thuds)

1762
01:28:02,069 --> 01:28:04,113
Stu, grab a sword.
- Gotcha.

1763
01:28:06,448 --> 01:28:07,208
(Heinz groaning)

1764
01:28:07,408 --> 01:28:09,201
Baracus, take Crowley.

1765
01:28:10,911 --> 01:28:11,837
[Montgomery] We've
gotta get out of here.

1766
01:28:12,037 --> 01:28:15,708
[Daniel] Stand and
fight, you gutless bastard.

1767
01:28:16,041 --> 01:28:17,551
Traven, Traven!

1768
01:28:18,335 --> 01:28:19,878
This is not a game.

1769
01:28:20,212 --> 01:28:22,493
I don't mind running her
through to get to you, Crowley.

1770
01:28:22,548 --> 01:28:26,343
Daniel, please, this
brute will run me through.

1771
01:28:27,720 --> 01:28:32,016
(sword thudding)
(Montgomery groaning)

1772
01:28:32,349 --> 01:28:34,393
(body thudding)

1773
01:28:34,727 --> 01:28:36,278
[R.D.] Hold it!

1774
01:28:36,478 --> 01:28:38,647
- Will.
- Everybody stop.

1775
01:28:38,981 --> 01:28:42,776
I think we got ourselves
a Mexican standoff here.

1776
01:28:43,110 --> 01:28:44,695
Yes, it does, Baracus.

1777
01:28:45,029 --> 01:28:46,947
But I think we can all come to terms.

1778
01:28:47,281 --> 01:28:48,124
You don't seem to be in a position

1779
01:28:48,324 --> 01:28:50,659
to make any demands, Crowley.

1780
01:28:50,993 --> 01:28:52,211
It's four against two.

1781
01:28:52,411 --> 01:28:55,039
No, Will, every man for himself.

1782
01:28:59,918 --> 01:29:03,339
Enough talk. I wanna kill you, Crowley.

1783
01:29:03,672 --> 01:29:05,966
Now, what would that get you?

1784
01:29:08,510 --> 01:29:09,895
My freedom.

1785
01:29:10,095 --> 01:29:12,056
I give you your freedom.

1786
01:29:13,557 --> 01:29:15,768
You kill me, Baracus,

1787
01:29:16,101 --> 01:29:20,064
and you remain the little
rodent that you are.

1788
01:29:20,397 --> 01:29:22,983
Join me and you'll have
all the wealth and power

1789
01:29:23,317 --> 01:29:25,077
you ever dreamed of.

1790
01:29:25,736 --> 01:29:27,571
I want the woman, too.

1791
01:29:28,739 --> 01:29:29,999
Hold on, Crowley.

1792
01:29:30,199 --> 01:29:32,368
Do it and your boy here
gets his final shade.

1793
01:29:32,701 --> 01:29:35,162
And you need Traven to help
run this twisted operation

1794
01:29:35,496 --> 01:29:36,380
and help supply you with fresh meat.

1795
01:29:36,580 --> 01:29:38,082
You have a point there.

1796
01:29:38,415 --> 01:29:40,167
Traven is integral to the game,

1797
01:29:40,501 --> 01:29:43,462
besides being a longstanding employee.

1798
01:29:45,297 --> 01:29:46,515
Take this one.

1799
01:29:46,715 --> 01:29:48,015
Sorry, baby.

1800
01:29:50,677 --> 01:29:54,431
Now, let's exchange the
convict for the warden.

1801
01:29:56,100 --> 01:29:57,401
Let him go.

1802
01:30:02,189 --> 01:30:05,651
Ah, god, this deal-making's
been energizing.

1803
01:30:05,984 --> 01:30:06,619
(door whooshes)

1804
01:30:06,819 --> 01:30:07,870
(alarm ringing)
(suspenseful music)

1805
01:30:08,070 --> 01:30:09,663
What do you think your chances

1806
01:30:09,863 --> 01:30:11,573
are of getting out of here alive?

1807
01:30:11,907 --> 01:30:13,826
We'll take our chances.

1808
01:30:14,159 --> 01:30:17,788
Silly boy, these men
are just the beginning.

1809
01:30:20,457 --> 01:30:25,129
(sighs) I'm not going back to prison.

1810
01:30:25,462 --> 01:30:27,673
You probably will kill us, Crowley.

1811
01:30:28,006 --> 01:30:31,718
But you can be damn sure
we're gonna take you with us.

1812
01:30:32,052 --> 01:30:33,478
I believe you.

1813
01:30:34,179 --> 01:30:35,814
But what a waste.

1814
01:30:36,765 --> 01:30:40,936
There is one other way to
avert further bloodshed.

1815
01:30:41,270 --> 01:30:42,910
You see, Will, I've invested a tremendous

1816
01:30:43,105 --> 01:30:46,400
amount of energy and time in training you.

1817
01:30:49,570 --> 01:30:52,781
We're on the cutting edge of technology

1818
01:30:53,115 --> 01:30:56,660
and you've proven yourself
the ultimate warrior.

1819
01:30:56,994 --> 01:31:01,123
If you go back in the game,
your friends can go free.

1820
01:31:02,416 --> 01:31:03,759
- No.
- I swear it.

1821
01:31:03,959 --> 01:31:04,593
Will, don't do it.

1822
01:31:04,793 --> 01:31:06,011
We can fight our way out of here.

1823
01:31:06,211 --> 01:31:08,172
