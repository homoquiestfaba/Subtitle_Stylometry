1
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:25,599
In May 1980, Fidel Castro opened
the harbor at Mariel, Cuba,

2
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,434
with the apparent intention
of letting some of his people

3
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:32,557
join their relatives
in the United States.

4
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,792
Within seventy-two hours, 3,000
U.S. Boats were headed for Cuba.

5
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,997
It soon became evident that Castro
was forcing the boat owners

6
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:43,152
to carry back with them
not only their relatives

7
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:45,754
but the dregs of his jails.

8
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,877
Of the 125,000 refugees
that landed in Florida,

9
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,111
an estimated 25,000
had criminal records.

10
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:57,277
...they are unwilling to adapt
to the spirit of our revolution.

11
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,476
We don't want them!
We don't need them!

12
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:12,512
MARIEL HARBOUR, CUBA

13
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,198
What do you call yourself?

14
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:38,471
Antonio Montana.
And you, what you call yourself?

15
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,752
Where'd you learn English, Tony?
In school.

16
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:45,000
And my father,
he was from the United States.

17
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,438
Just like you, you know?

18
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,639
He was a Yankee.

19
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,117
He used to take me a lot
to the movies.

20
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,235
I learned.

21
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:56,995
I watch the guys
like Humphrey Bogart, James Cagney.

22
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,154
They teach me to talk.
I like those guys.

23
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:05,630
I always know one day
I'm coming here, United States.

24
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,309
So where's your old man now?
He dead. He die.

25
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,516
Sometime. Somewhere.

26
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,716
Mother?
She dead, too.

27
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,832
What work you do in Cuba?
You know, things.

28
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:19,832
I was this, that.

29
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,199
Construction business.

30
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:25,798
I work a lot with my hands.
I was in the Army.

31
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:28,918
Any family in the States?
Cousins, brother-in-law?

32
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,992
Nobody. Everybody's dead.

33
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,038
You ever been to jail, Tony?

34
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:37,669
Me? Jail? No way, no.

35
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,198
Been in a mental hospital?
Yeah. On the boat coming over.

36
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:46,472
What about homosexuality, Tony?
You like men?

37
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:49,074
<i>You like to dress up like a woman?</i>

38
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:52,108
What is wrong with this guy?
He kidding me or what?

39
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,350
Just answer the questions, Tony.

40
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,551
Okay. No.

41
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,709
<i>Fuck, no.</i>

42
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,431
Arrested for vagrancy? Marijuana?

43
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,079
Never, man.
Heroin?

44
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,515
Cocaine?
No.

45
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:11,397
Where'd you get the beauty
scar, tough guy? Eating pussy?

46
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,951
How am I gonna get a scar like that
eating pussy?

47
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,995
This was when I was a kid, you know?

48
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,112
You should see the other kid.
You can't recognize him.

49
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,349
And this?

50
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,509
What? That's nothing.
That's from my sweetheart.

51
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,956
Sweetheart, my ass! We've
been seeing more and more of these.

52
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,589
<i>Some kind of code</i>
<i>these guys used in the can.</i>

53
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,069
<i>Pitchfork means an assassin</i>
<i>or something.</i>

54
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,593
<i>You want to tell us about it...</i>

55
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,513
<i>or you want to take a trip</i>
<i>to the detention centre?</i>

56
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,395
Okay, you got me.

57
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,235
I was in the can one time.
For buying dollars. Big deal.

58
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,510
That's pretty funny, Tony.
That's true.

59
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,352
It was a Canadian tourist.

60
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,590
Did you mug him first?
Get him out of here!

61
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,875
Come on!
So I fuck up!

62
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,157
Let me talk to this guy. Please!
Let me talk to him a minute.

63
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,514
You a Communist?

64
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,633
How'd you like it?

65
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:09,429
They tell you always what to do,
what to think, what to feel.

66
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,830
Do you want to be like a sheep?
Like all those other people?

67
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,952
I don't have to listen to this!

68
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:18,919
You wanna work 8, 10 fucking hours?
You own nothing, you got nothing!

69
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:22,231
Do you want a <i>chivato</i>
on every corner...

70
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,753
watching everything you do?

71
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,432
Everything you say, man?

72
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,156
You know I eat octopus
three times a day?

73
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,515
I got fucking octopus
coming out of my ears.

74
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,797
I got fucking Russian shoes,
my feet's coming through.

75
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,799
How'd you like that?

76
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,874
You want me to stay there
and do nothing?

77
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,191
I'm no fucking criminal, man.
I'm no <i>puta</i> or thief.

78
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,870
I'm Tony Montana,
a political prisoner from Cuba.

79
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,039
I want my fucking human rights, now!

80
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,032
Like President Jimmy Carter says.
Okay?

81
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:56,078
Carter should see this human right.
He's really good.

82
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,833
- What do you say?
- I don't believe any of this shit!

83
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:02,959
They all sound alike to me.
That Castro is shitting all over us.

84
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:05,838
Send the bastard to Freedom Town.
Let them see him.

85
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,911
Get him out of here.
Know something?

86
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,035
You can send me anywhere.

87
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,315
Here, there, this, that.
It don't matter.

88
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,278
There's nothing you can do to me
that Castro hasn't done...

89
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,634
Get him out of here!

90
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:20,031
So?
So?

91
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,351
What'd you tell them?

92
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:26,991
What you told me to tell them.
That we... I was in sanitation.

93
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,798
They didn't go for it.

94
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:32,110
- Sanitation?
- Yeah.

95
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:37,559
I told you to tell them you was
in a sanatarium, not sanitation.

96
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,279
- Sanatarium. Yeah.
- You didn't tell me that.

97
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:46,070
No, I told you to say you had TB
and you was in a sanatarium.

98
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,514
You was cured.

99
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:51,909
- When did you tell me that?
- You should've kept your mouth shut.

100
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,195
They'd think you was a horse
and let you out.

101
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:04,880
ONE MONTH LATER

102
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,517
Tony! Montana!

103
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,509
Tony Montana! Come here.

104
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,715
Come here, man. I gotta talk to you.

105
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,797
<i>Come on, man. It's important.</i>

106
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,711
So close, man.
Come on.

107
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,040
- I gotta talk to you.
- Where are you going?

108
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,270
- Leave him alone.
- I got better things to do.

109
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,476
You're chicken, man.
You almost made it.

110
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:16,074
Are you ready for some good news?

111
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,198
Sure. What you got, man?

112
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:20,271
We can be outta this place
in 30 days.

113
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:23,750
Not only that, but we got
a green card and a job in Miami.

114
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,030
Now are we made or are we made, man?

115
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,436
What do we gotta do?
Go to Cuba and hit the Beard?

116
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:32,080
- No, man, somebody else.
- You're kidding?

117
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,594
- No.
- You're not kidding?

118
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:38,678
Guy named Rebenga, man.
Emilio Rebenga.

119
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:39,875
Rebenga?

120
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:43,229
- I know that name.
- Yeah?

121
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,833
- He's political.
- Yeah.

122
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,556
Well, he's coming in here
today. Castro just sprung him.

123
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,350
<i>This guy was one of the top dogs</i>
<i>for Fidel in the early days.</i>

124
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:56,833
Castro felt he couldn't trust him
and threw him in jail.

125
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:00,118
<i>But while he was on top,</i>
<i>he tortured a few guys to death.</i>

126
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:03,397
<i>One of the guy's brothers</i>
<i>is a rich guy in Miami now.</i>

127
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,879
<i>He wants the favor repaid.</i>

128
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,672
That's where we come in.

129
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,436
It's ugly, man.

130
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,429
Yeah.

131
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:21,749
You tell your guys in Miami,
your friend...

132
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,998
it'd be a pleasure.

133
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,470
I'd kill a Communist for fun...

134
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:30,835
but for a green card,
I gonna carve him up real nice.

135
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,913
MIAMI, FLORIDA, AUGUST 11, 1980.
HUNDREDS OF CUBAN REFUGEES

136
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:36,679
BEGAN RIOTING THIS MORNING
AT A DETENTION CENTRE SITUATED

137
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:39,718
UNDER INTERSTATE 95 IN NORTH MIAMI,
BURNING TENTS AND ATTACKING

138
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:42,951
IMMIGRATION AND NATURALISATION
GUARDS WITH PIPES, STICKS AND ROCKS.

139
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:44,310
<i>Libertad! Libertad!</i>

140
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,759
Rebenga!

141
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,318
From a friend you fucked!

142
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,557
That face. That's nice.

143
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:06,518
- That doesn't look like me.
- That looks pretty, man.

144
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:39,829
Fuck!

145
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:46,713
Your big shot friend better
come up with something soon.

146
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,268
I didn't come to the U.S.
To break my fucking back.

147
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,669
He's coming!
What do you want from me?

148
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,754
Fucking thing!

149
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,115
I told you.

150
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,874
What's wrong?

151
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:13,749
Look at that one.

152
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:16,274
That one in the pink.
She's beautiful.

153
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:18,032
<i>Look at those titties.</i>

154
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,438
Look at that punk with her.

155
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,956
What's he got that I don't have?

156
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:27,037
Well, he's very handsome,
for one thing, you know?

157
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,470
I mean, look at the way he dresses.

158
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,950
Come on.
That's style, flash, pizzazz.

159
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:38,952
And a little coke money
doesn't hurt nobody.

160
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,234
Look at this.

161
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,594
Fucking onions.

162
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,998
They ought to be picking gold
from the street.

163
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,559
There's two guys
looking for you out there.

164
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,670
That's him, man. That's <i>El mono.</i>
I told you.

165
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,398
Don't stay too fucking long.

166
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,789
We've got a lot of work to do.

167
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,551
Waldo! Good to see you, man.

168
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:30,996
This is my friend, Tony Montana,
I've been telling you about.

169
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:34,311
<i>Tony, that's Omar Suarez,</i>
<i>and that's Waldo Rojas over there.</i>

170
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,113
I got something for you.

171
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,156
Yeah? What do we gotta do?

172
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,596
Gotta unload a boat. Marijuana.
45 tons. You get $500 each.

173
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:46,032
- $500? That's great.
- You gotta be kidding.

174
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,388
$500?

175
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:54,069
Who do you think we are,
baggage handlers?

176
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,993
The going rate on a boat
is $1,000 a night.

177
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,069
You know that.

178
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,868
First you gotta work
your way up to $500.

179
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:05,394
What I did for you in Freedom Town,
what was that?

180
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,550
That Rebenga hit
was a game of dominoes?

181
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:10,108
- That was something else.
- Shut up! Take it easy.

182
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,668
What's with this dishwasher, <i>chico</i>?

183
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:16,230
Don't he know we could've got any
space cadet to hit Rebenga cheaper?

184
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,595
- $50!
- Then why didn't you?

185
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,951
Don't call me no fucking dishwasher,
or I'll kick your monkey ass.

186
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,632
Who the fuck are you?

187
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,272
You can't do that, man!

188
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,555
The Colombians!

189
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,556
Okay, all right, big man!

190
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:38,030
You want to make some big bucks?
Let's see how tough you are.

191
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,436
You know something about cocaine?

192
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,312
You kidding me or what?

193
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:50,074
There's a bunch of Colombians
coming in Friday.

194
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:53,994
<i>New guys. They say they got</i>
<i>two keys for us, for openers.</i>

195
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:57,959
Pure coke. Hotel in Miami Beach.
I want you to go over there.

196
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:00,349
If it's what they say,
pay 'em and bring it back.

197
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:02,431
Do that, you get $5,000.

198
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,316
Go, pay them, bring it back, yeah?

199
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,670
You know how to handle
a machine gun?

200
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,796
Yeah, man. We were in the Army.

201
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:18,390
- You gonna need a couple other guys.
- That's no problem.

202
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:21,396
Be at Hector's Bodega
at noon Friday.

203
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,277
You get the buy money then.

204
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:29,318
If anything happens
to that buy money...

205
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:32,039
my boss will stick your heads
up your asses...

206
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:34,236
faster than a rabbit gets fucked!

207
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,719
I'm scared.

208
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,351
- You're pushing your luck.
- Don't worry.

209
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:43,432
- That was dumb.
- You worry too much.

210
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,919
You'll have a heart attack.

211
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,037
You act like that guy's
doing you a favor or something.

212
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:51,908
- What's this with the Colombians?
- What does it matter?

213
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:55,954
He says "Colombians,"
and you make these eyes...

214
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:59,032
I don't like fucking Colombians,
okay?

215
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,593
What you guys doing?

216
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,636
There's a lot of dishes
to be washed.

217
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,392
Wash 'em yourself.

218
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,629
I retire!

219
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:10,110
What the fuck you gonna do now?

220
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:13,471
- Don't come back here!
- I gotta look after my investment!

221
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:16,757
Fuck you guys!
Close the shop!

222
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,400
Look at those tits.
She's begging for it.

223
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,756
Are you fucking crazy?
She's 103 years old.

224
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,397
Not that one, man! That one!

225
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,436
Which one?
The young one.

226
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:45,193
Move the fucking car.
We're at a stop sign.

227
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:51,196
We're just staying loose up here.
You gotta stay loose.

228
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,714
You can't worry.
You'll have a heart attack.

229
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:58,078
Just play it cool. Miami Beach.
Miami Beach, man!

230
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:21,070
The money stays in the trunk
till I come out.

231
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,594
You got it? Me, nobody else. Okay.

232
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:27,589
I'm not out in 15 minutes,
something's wrong. Okay?

233
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:30,951
Room 9. You ready?
Sure thing.

234
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,875
Okay.
You mind leaving the door open?

235
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,030
So my brother-in-law sees
everything's okay.

236
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,031
Sure. No problem.

237
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:37,508
No problem.

238
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:41,598
Hello. This is Marta.

239
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,153
Marta, hello.

240
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,232
I am Hector.

241
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,199
And I am Tony.

242
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,749
So, Omar says you're okay.

243
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:03,469
Yeah? Good. Omar's okay.

244
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:05,635
Okay.

245
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:13,349
So, you got the money?

246
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,074
You got the stuff?

247
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:21,709
Sure I have the stuff,
but not right here with me now.

248
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,392
I got it close by.

249
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,749
I don't have the money either, man.

250
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,397
I have it close by, too.

251
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,395
Where?

252
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,309
In the car?

253
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:43,238
No, not in the car, man.
No?

254
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:46,758
How about you?
Where you have your stuff?

255
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,349
Not far.

256
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:01,350
Okay. You want me to come in?
We start over again?

257
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,319
Where you from, Tony?

258
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,597
What the fuck difference
does it make where I'm from?

259
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,359
Take it easy, man.

260
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:14,509
I just want to get to know
who I do business with.

261
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:18,957
You'll know me once you do business
with me and stop fucking around.

262
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,555
Okay?

263
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,638
What's the story?
Tony!

264
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:35,839
You know, Frog Face,
you just fucked yourself.

265
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:38,909
- You steal from me, you're dead.
- Yeah?

266
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,511
You want to give me the cash...

267
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,950
or do I kill your brother first...

268
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,273
before I kill you?

269
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:56,510
Why don't you try
sticking your head up your ass?

270
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,757
See if it fits.

271
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:02,715
Yeah? Okay.

272
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:28,232
<i>It's very important.</i>
<i>I understand.</i>

273
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,878
<i>Thank you.</i>
<i>You're welcome.</i>

274
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:31,837
<i>You forecasted an earthquake...</i>

275
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:34,115
<i>in the 3-to-4-point range</i>
<i>this morning.</i>

276
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,278
<i>We had an earthquake</i>
<i>in the 3-to-4-point range.</i>

277
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,351
<i>I'm impressed.</i>
<i>Thank you, sir.</i>

278
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:42,673
<i>However, isn't it</i>
<i>rather slender evidence...</i>

279
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:55,197
You have such beautiful skin.

280
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,390
I like the way you...

281
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:05,879
I don't know what I'm supposed
to do today, but...

282
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:30,429
Antonio, <i>mira</i>!

283
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:33,391
Watch what happens to your friend.

284
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:35,471
If you don't want this
to happen to you...

285
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:37,039
give me the money.

286
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,513
Come on, come on.

287
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,918
Now the leg.

288
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:23,116
Let's do it, man. Come on.

289
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:30,431
We're all gonna be all right.

290
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:42,957
Okay, <i>cara cicatriz.</i>

291
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:46,314
You can die, too.
It makes no difference to me.

292
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:54,669
Last chance, <i>pendejo</i>!

293
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,548
Fuck you!

294
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:04,428
- You okay?
- Yeah, man. It went in and out.

295
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:17,231
Okay, take him out of here, quick!

296
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:19,151
Chi Chi! Get the <i>yeyo.</i>

297
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:42,954
- Your turn.
- I kill you!

298
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:44,269
Die!

299
00:27:57,320 --> 00:28:00,835
Hurry up! Get in! Come on. Let's go!

300
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,593
<i>Close the door!</i>

301
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:17,796
Bunch of cowboys.
Somebody fucked up.

302
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,436
<i>Yeah, well,</i>
<i>I'll check it out right away.</i>

303
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:24,513
You do that, Omar. You do that.

304
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:27,235
<i>You still got the money?</i>
Yeah.

305
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:30,116
And I got the <i>yeyo.</i>

306
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:33,274
<i>You got the</i> yeyo<i>?</i>
Yeah, right.

307
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,751
<i>Bring it here.</i>
Fuck you.

308
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:38,115
I'm taking it to Lopez myself.

309
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:40,435
Not you, me.

310
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,799
Nice fucking guy.

311
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:15,276
Frank Lopez. Tony Montana.

312
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:18,557
Tony Montana.
Mr. Lopez. It's a real pleasure.

313
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:19,914
You can call me Frank.

314
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,514
<i>Everybody calls me Frank.</i>
<i>My Little League team.</i>

315
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:25,074
Even the fucking prosecutors
around town...

316
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,275
they all call me Frank.

317
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:27,952
- Okay, Frank.
- How are you?

318
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:29,917
Manny Ribera.

319
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:32,555
- He caught one on the job.
- Went right through.

320
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,153
We heard about that.

321
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:37,312
Omar, he tells me great things
about you guys.

322
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,558
Well, Omar's okay.

323
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:43,677
Not to mention, of course,
the nice job you did for me.

324
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:47,275
- That Commie son of a bitch...
- You don't have to mention that.

325
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:50,238
- That was fun.
- That was fun?

326
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,754
- Damn right.
- That was fun.

327
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,712
Sometimes it's fun.

328
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:59,512
What do you want to drink?
Scotch, gin, rum? What do you like?

329
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:02,592
Gin is fine. Want some? Two gins.

330
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,838
I need a guy with steel
in his balls, Tony.

331
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:09,310
A guy like you. And I need him
around me all the time.

332
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:12,631
You, Tony, and your <i>compadre</i> here.

333
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,033
Here's the stuff.

334
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:20,715
Two keys.

335
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:25,550
It cost my friend Angel his life.
Here's the money.

336
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,472
My gift to you.

337
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:36,030
I'm sorry about your friend, Tony.

338
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,311
If people would do business
the right way...

339
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,868
there'd be no fuck-ups like this.

340
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,394
Don't think
I don't appreciate the gesture.

341
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:48,278
<i>You're gonna find,</i>
<i>you stay loyal in this business...</i>

342
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:51,557
you're gonna move up.
You're gonna move up fast.

343
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,557
And you'll find out
your biggest problem...

344
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,517
is not bringing in the stuff...

345
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:05,194
but what to do
with all the fucking cash!

346
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,071
I hope I have that problem someday.

347
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,912
You'll have that problem,
don't worry.

348
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,877
Sit down over here.

349
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,788
Where the hell's Elvira?
It's late. Go find her, will you?

350
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:20,678
Jesus! Fucking broad.

351
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:24,753
She spends half her life dressing,
the other half undressing.

352
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:28,276
Gotta get her in between.

353
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:31,110
She's coming.
Yeah.

354
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:33,834
You gotta jump on her
when she's not looking.

355
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,751
That's the best time.

356
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:40,116
What are you guys doing tonight?

357
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:43,192
You wanna go to a nice restaurant
with me? You hungry?

358
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,309
I could eat a horse.

359
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:48,312
- Okay, they'll cook you a horse.
- I'll eat it.

360
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:56,234
Tell me, where'd they get you?
Right there in the side?

361
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,595
It's nothing.
It went right through me.

362
00:31:58,680 --> 00:31:59,669
It hit the wall.

363
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,955
I ran out of bullets
like an asshole.

364
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:05,350
<i>When I changed the clip,</i>
<i>a guy who I thought I killed...</i>

365
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,510
<i>wasn't dead and shot me.</i>

366
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,911
The guy was behind me. I killed him.

367
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,355
- How many bullets you catch?
- Bullets? One bullet.

368
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,668
Nine millimeter.

369
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:27,589
Elvira, where the hell you been?
It's 10:00. I'm starving.

370
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:30,797
You're always hungry.
You should try starving.

371
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,392
Where you going? Come on.

372
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:37,632
<i>Come over here!</i>
<i>I want you to meet a friend of mine.</i>

373
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:42,156
Tony Montana. Elvira.

374
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:46,714
- Hello.
- Manny Ribera. Elvira.

375
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:50,429
So, there are five of us.
Where are we having dinner?

376
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:52,875
I thought we'd go
to the Babylon Club.

377
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:54,878
- Again?
- Again.

378
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:58,157
You know, Frank, if anyone wanted
to assassinate you...

379
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:00,390
you wouldn't be too hard to find.

380
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:03,517
Assassinate me?
Who the hell would want to kill me?

381
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:07,471
I got nothing but friends!

382
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:11,314
You never know. Maybe the catcher
on your Little League team.

383
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:15,429
The catcher? That son of a bitch,
he didn't get a base hit all season.

384
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,873
<i>I should kill him!</i>

385
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,151
You know who that is?
Luis and Miguel Echevierra.

386
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:28,957
They got the biggest distribution
set-up from here to Houston...

387
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:31,235
Tucson, all down that way.

388
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,032
What do you think of that?

389
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,029
Look.

390
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:41,430
<i>You see that fat bastard?</i>
<i>That's Nacho Contreras.</i>

391
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:43,431
<i>El Gordo!</i>

392
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:46,273
<i>He's got more cash</i>
<i>than anybody in this place.</i>

393
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,868
He's a real <i>chazer</i>!

394
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,355
You know what a <i>chazer</i> is?

395
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:57,915
No, Frank, you tell me.
What is a <i>chazer</i>?

396
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,468
It's the Yiddish word for "pig."

397
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:05,156
A guy who wants more than he needs.
He don't fly straight no more.

398
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:10,394
So, it comes down to one thing,
Tony boy, and you never forget it.

399
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,390
Lesson Number 1:

400
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:18,519
Don't underestimate...

401
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,875
the other guy's greed!

402
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,469
Lesson Number 2:

403
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:25,516
Don't get high on your own supply.

404
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:29,717
That's right. Lesson Number 2:
Don't get high on your own supply.

405
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:32,234
'Course, not everybody
follows the rules.

406
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:39,357
Your champagne, Mr. Lopez.

407
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:42,079
That is '64?
The best, Mr. Lopez.

408
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:45,470
Omar, you pour it, and you bring
another bottle right away, will you?

409
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:52,513
$550 for this bottle, Tony.
What do you think of that?

410
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:56,076
- That's pretty good.
- For a bunch of fucking grapes.

411
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:02,513
So, here's to old friends
and to new friends.

412
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,758
How you like it, Tony?

413
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,431
- That's good, Frank.
- That's good?

414
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,954
- Like you say, man.
- That's good!

415
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:23,713
I'm gonna get you new clothes, too.

416
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:26,598
I'm gonna get you $550 suits...

417
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,032
so you look real sharp.

418
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:32,070
'Cause I want you to work for me.

419
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:37,358
I want you and your boys
to work with Omar here.

420
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:40,715
We are going to do...

421
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:43,189
something big next month.

422
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:47,836
We are running a string of mules
from Colombia.

423
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:51,676
You do good on that,
there'll be some other things.

424
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:55,869
That sounds like fun to me, Frank.

425
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,473
You want a cigar?

426
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:06,393
You wanna dance, Frank,
or sit here and have a heart attack?

427
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:15,192
Who? Me, dance?
I want a heart attack instead.

428
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,277
Don't foam into the Dommie P.

429
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:26,509
How about you?

430
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,677
What? You want me to dance?

431
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:34,716
Yeah, sure. Go on, Tony. You dance.

432
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,798
Go on. Have some fun.

433
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:51,872
What do you think of him?

434
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,151
I think he's a fucking peasant!

435
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,914
But you get a guy like that
on your side...

436
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:03,595
he breaks his back for you.

437
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:33,550
- What's your name?
- What?

438
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:37,188
What's your name? Elvira what?

439
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:39,555
- Hancock.
- What?

440
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:42,109
- Hancock!
- Hancock?

441
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:46,598
Sounds like a bird. Hancock.

442
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:48,353
Flying around.

443
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:51,674
Where you from?

444
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,516
- Baltimore.
- What?

445
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:56,432
- Baltimore!
- Baltimore?

446
00:38:56,920 --> 00:39:00,515
- Where's that?
- It doesn't really matter, okay?

447
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:04,108
I'm just trying to be friendly.

448
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:06,356
I don't need another friend...

449
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:08,670
especially one
who just got off a banana boat.

450
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:11,872
Banana boat?

451
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:15,555
Hold it. You got the wrong guy.
I don't come off no banana boat.

452
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:19,475
<i>You're thinking of someone else,</i>
<i>maybe.</i>

453
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:21,916
Aren't you part
of the Cuban crime wave?

454
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:26,152
What you talking crazy for?
I'm a political refugee here.

455
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:29,153
So take it easy. Don't talk crazy.
Sorry.

456
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:32,597
I didn't know you were so sensitive
about your diplomatic status.

457
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:35,319
What is your problem, baby?

458
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:36,629
<i>You're good-looking.</i>

459
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:38,711
<i>You got a beautiful body,</i>
<i>beautiful legs...</i>

460
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:41,155
a beautiful face,
all these guys in love with you.

461
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:42,719
Only you got a look in your eye...

462
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:45,360
like you haven't been fucked
in a year!

463
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:47,832
Hey, José.

464
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:51,071
Who, why, when and how I fuck
is none of your business, okay?

465
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:54,277
Now you're talking to me, baby.
That I like. Keep it coming.

466
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:57,352
Don't call me "baby"!
I'm not your baby.

467
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:00,474
Not yet,
but you gotta give me some time.

468
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:05,872
Even if I were blind, desperate...

469
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:08,190
starved and begging for it
on a desert island...

470
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:10,555
you'd be the last thing
I'd ever fuck.

471
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,638
That chick he's with...

472
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:17,793
Yeah?
She likes me.

473
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:22,717
She likes you? How do you know?

474
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,149
I know.

475
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:28,557
The eyes, <i>chico.</i> They never lie.

476
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:35,634
- Are you serious?
- Serious? What do you think?

477
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:38,115
That's the boss's lady, okay?

478
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:42,318
- You're gonna get us killed.
- Fuck you, man. The boss's lady.

479
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:44,952
That guy's soft.

480
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,399
Look in his face.

481
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:53,834
The booze and the <i>concha</i>
tell him what to do.

482
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:58,590
Don't fucking go crazy on me, okay?

483
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:03,189
Just remember last year at this time
we were in a fucking cage, okay?

484
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:04,599
You remember.

485
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:07,272
I'd like to forget that.

486
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:11,396
- I say be happy with what you got.
- You be happy.

487
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:16,112
- Me, I want what's coming to me.
- What's coming to you?

488
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:20,557
The world, <i>chico...</i>

489
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:23,791
and everything in it.

490
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:34,197
THREE MONTHS LATER

491
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:59,439
This is paradise.

492
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:03,075
This is paradise, I'm telling you.

493
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:07,638
This town's like a great big pussy
just waiting to get fucked.

494
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:11,429
I should've come here 10 years ago.

495
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:14,193
I'd have been a millionaire
by this time.

496
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:18,033
By this time,
I'd have had my own boat...

497
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:20,429
my own car, my own golf course.

498
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:23,353
You know what I want?
I thought of this the other day.

499
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:24,998
A line of blue jeans.

500
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:28,152
With my name written
on the back of chicks' asses.

501
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:30,795
How's that?

502
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:33,789
That sounds completely crazy to me.

503
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:36,793
Look at that. Look.

504
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:39,434
<i>You're missing the sights.</i>
<i>That's what you're doing.</i>

505
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:41,476
<i>We're missing the action.</i>

506
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:46,154
Want to have some ice cream
with my friend and me?

507
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:47,958
Get lost, greaseball!

508
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:50,712
- Look at that.
- Ice cream?

509
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,472
- That's right.
- You said "ice cream"?

510
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:55,632
- Girls like ice cream.
- Come on. That won't work.

511
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:57,597
You can't do it that way.

512
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:00,478
You know how you pick up chicks
in this country?

513
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:07,511
- What was that? What you just did?
- That's what you do.

514
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:10,311
- That's disgusting.
- Watch.

515
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:13,119
Look at that fucking thing.
You look like a lizard.

516
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:15,350
Like a bug coming out of your mouth.

517
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:18,310
Figures you wouldn't understand.

518
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:21,472
But the women in this country,
when you do that, they know.

519
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:24,393
- They know what?
- They understand. They go crazy.

520
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:27,715
It'll take practice,
but you gotta learn.

521
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:29,870
'Cause women love
when you suck the pussy.

522
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:31,154
Look at that.

523
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:38,113
She's looking at us.

524
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:44,236
- You think you can do it with her?
- I think I can.

525
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:46,999
- You want to try it with her?
- Why not?

526
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:51,351
- You gonna watch me?
- I'm looking at you. Go ahead.

527
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:52,998
- You won't do it.
- Watch this.

528
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:55,759
I'm with you, man.

529
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:57,833
I'm gonna get her.

530
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:02,830
Go ahead, Romeo! Do your thing.

531
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:05,669
- Just be quiet. Just hang back.
- Romeo!

532
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:14,874
You're looking very pretty today.
Yes, you. I've been watching you.

533
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:17,031
You want to see something funny?

534
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:19,156
Take a look over there.
See that man?

535
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:21,595
<i>Watch that guy.</i>
<i>I gotta sit down here.</i>

536
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:22,909
I gotta watch my friend.

537
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,560
He gonna stick his tongue out
to that girl.

538
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:26,999
Look at that.

539
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:29,029
You're sick!

540
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:31,236
You see what happened to him?

541
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:35,110
- If I wasn't a nice guy...
- She's too big for you.

542
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:37,078
Causing trouble like that, come on.

543
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:39,515
- Bitch! Lesbian!
- What I try to tell you?

544
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:40,953
What I try to tell you?

545
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:43,838
This country,
you gotta make the money first.

546
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:47,873
Then when you get the money,
you get the power.

547
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:51,032
Then when you get the power,
then you get the women.

548
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:53,791
That's why you gotta
make your own moves.

549
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:55,518
That's the one I rented.

550
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:59,590
No. That's her, man. There she is.

551
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:01,189
<i>About time.</i>

552
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:04,515
Frank got held up
at the golf course.

553
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:06,079
He told me to pick you up.

554
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:09,188
<i>He said he'd meet us</i>
<i>at the track later.</i>

555
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:15,231
He said to bet on Ice Cream
in the first, by the way.

556
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:19,873
In that thing? You must be kidding.

557
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:24,512
What you talking about?
That's a Cadillac.

558
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:29,192
- I wouldn't be caught dead in that.
- Come on.

559
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:34,436
It's got a few years,
but it's a cream puff.

560
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:37,476
It looks like somebody's nightmare.

561
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:48,830
So, you like this better?

562
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:55,911
It's like one of them tigers
from India.

563
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:57,957
Crazy guy.
Know what he's been doing?

564
00:45:58,040 --> 00:46:00,759
Dragging me to the zoo
to look at tigers.

565
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:02,518
He says he's gonna buy one.

566
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:05,034
<i>You do that</i>
<i>and you won't have any friends left.</i>

567
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:08,192
Not that you have any now.
You'll like that tiger, man.

568
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:11,078
You gonna drive around with a tiger
in your passenger seat?

569
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:13,515
Maybe. Some lady tiger.

570
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:19,439
- How much?
- $43,000, fully equipped.

571
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:22,830
- That all?
- Machine-gun turrets are extra.

572
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:25,838
He's a funny guy. Come here, Manny.

573
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:29,989
Bullet-proof this, okay?

574
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:32,071
And this here and here.

575
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:34,474
<i>And the windows.</i>

576
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:41,311
- Get me a phone with a scrambler.
- A scrambler.

577
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:43,755
And a radio with scanners...

578
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:45,751
to pick up flying saucers,
stuff like that.

579
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:47,432
Don't forget the fog lights.

580
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:51,274
In case I get caught in a swamp.
That's a good idea.

581
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:57,118
Get out of the way, lady!
I'm trying to drive here!

582
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:00,755
I thought you were taking me
to Frank.

583
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:08,509
We got an hour. You hungry?

584
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:11,872
No, but I'm bored.

585
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:14,478
Well, that figures.

586
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:19,711
Check it out, Manny, okay?
And pay the guy.

587
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:23,072
And you take a taxi.
Meet me at the track, okay?

588
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:24,878
Good doing business with you.

589
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:32,389
I wouldn't buy the car
if you didn't like it.

590
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:35,153
Planning on driving the girls crazy,
aren't you, Tony?

591
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:37,390
Yeah. You know who?

592
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:41,118
What would Frank say?

593
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:45,038
I like Frank, you know?

594
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:47,312
Only I like you better.

595
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:57,070
- You got some for me?
- Sure.

596
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:19,196
Don't get confused, Tony.
I don't fuck around with the help.

597
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:30,115
You wanna play that way with me,
I play with you.

598
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:31,389
Shit.

599
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,672
Would you kiss me if I wear the hat?

600
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:34,795
No!

601
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:39,076
Playtime is over, okay?

602
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:35,188
Mama?

603
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:39,628
Long time.

604
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:43,992
No postcards from jail?

605
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:55,515
Gina.

606
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:59,953
- Tony?
- Look at you.

607
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:03,239
You're beautiful.

608
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:06,559
- I didn't...
- Mama, look at those eyes.

609
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:08,916
Look at that. She looks like me.

610
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:12,393
You know the last time I saw you,
you was like that.

611
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:15,836
You looked like a little boy.
Now look at you.

612
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:21,837
I got something for you.

613
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:28,512
It's no big deal.

614
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:44,755
I never thought I'd see you again,
you know?

615
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:46,876
You think they'd keep
a guy like me down?

616
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:48,439
Well, no.

617
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:57,275
- You look so good.
- Look, open that up. Open it.

618
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:00,115
- For me?
- I think so.

619
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:04,511
It's nothing much,
you know, nothing.

620
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:10,759
See what's written on the back?

621
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:12,114
On the back?

622
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:17,674
- Always.
- "Always." It's beautiful, Tony!

623
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:21,196
Mama is still working
in the factory...

624
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:23,316
and I work part-time
in a beauty parlor.

625
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:26,358
I'm doing hair, Tony.
Do you remember Hiram Gonzalez?

626
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:29,239
His father owned that barbershop.
It's his place.

627
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:31,834
Plus I go to junior college.
Miami Dade.

628
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,912
In two more years,
I get my cosmetology license.

629
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:38,151
- Then I'll be making enough money...
- Surprise!

630
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:41,359
All that's over, starting today.

631
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:42,749
Why?

632
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:47,311
My kid sister don't have to work
in no beauty parlor, and Mama...

633
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:50,229
she don't have to sew in no factory.

634
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:52,556
Your son made it, Mama.

635
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:55,194
He's a success.

636
00:51:56,320 --> 00:51:58,629
That's why
I didn't come around before.

637
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:03,274
I want you to see
what a good boy I've been.

638
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:06,999
Here's $1,000.

639
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:09,153
For you, Mama.

640
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:18,796
Who did you kill for this, Antonio?

641
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:21,471
I didn't kill nobody, Mama.

642
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:23,469
No?
No.

643
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:26,317
What are you doing now?

644
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:29,838
Banks, or is it still <i>bodegas</i>,
you and the others?

645
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:32,070
No! Things are different now.

646
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:34,879
I'm working
with an anti-Castro group.

647
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:36,798
I'm an organizer now.

648
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:39,075
I get a lot
of political contributions.

649
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:41,513
Sure you do.

650
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:48,718
A gun sticking in somebody's face
is how.

651
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:53,158
You know, all we hear about
in the papers...

652
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:57,753
is animals like you
and the killings.

653
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:01,591
It's Cubans like you who are giving
a bad name to our people.

654
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:04,877
People who come here, work hard
and make a good name for themselves.

655
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:06,837
People who send their children
to school.

656
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:08,558
What are you saying?
That's your son...

657
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:11,598
Son? I wish I had one.

658
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:13,389
He's a bum.

659
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:16,199
He was a bum then
and he's a bum now.

660
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:19,838
Who do you think you are?

661
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:25,113
We haven't heard a word
from you in five years.

662
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:30,674
You suddenly show up here,
throw some money around...

663
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:33,115
and think you can get my respect.

664
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:36,319
You think you can buy me
with jewellery?

665
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:39,836
You think you can come into my house
with your hotshot clothes...

666
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:42,309
and your jail manners
and make fun of us?

667
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:46,359
- You don't know what you're saying.
- That's not the way I am, Antonio!

668
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:48,949
That is not the way
I raised Gina to be!

669
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,355
You are not going to destroy her.

670
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:56,632
I don't need your money.

671
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:00,392
I work for my living.

672
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:03,388
I don't want you
in this house anymore!

673
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:05,717
I don't want you around Gina.

674
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:09,194
So come on. Get out!

675
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:24,154
And take this lousy money with you.
It stinks.

676
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,753
Why do you have to spoil it
for everybody?

677
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:33,872
<i>I'm sorry, Tony.</i>

678
00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:36,879
Okay, Mama.

679
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,433
No. Tony, wait a minute!

680
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:44,590
Don't go, please!
Gina, stay here!

681
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:46,876
No, Mama.
He's no good. Gina!

682
00:54:48,120 --> 00:54:49,872
Tony, wait, please!

683
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:54,758
I'm sorry. I don't know.
Mama, ever since Papa left she's...

684
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:56,910
Forget Papa. We never had one.

685
00:54:57,120 --> 00:54:59,554
I know you did some bad things
back then.

686
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:02,394
In the Army,
I know you got into some trouble.

687
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:04,152
The Communists...

688
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:06,231
they're always trying
to tell you what to do.

689
00:55:06,320 --> 00:55:09,039
- Mama doesn't understand that.
- I know.

690
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:13,068
I just... I don't know.

691
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:15,628
I just want you to know
that I don't care.

692
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:19,629
<i>It doesn't matter to me how long</i>
<i>you've been away, five or ten years.</i>

693
00:55:21,640 --> 00:55:24,712
You're my blood, always.

694
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:26,949
I know.

695
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:40,112
- Come on. I want you to take this.
- I gotta go back in.

696
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:42,794
- No, Tony. Please.
- You need this.

697
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:44,154
What will I tell her?

698
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:45,912
Take that.
You don't tell her anything.

699
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:49,390
Don't tell her I gave it to you,
but give her some from time to time.

700
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:51,994
And listen, you go out yourself.

701
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:55,356
Go ahead, go out, do some things.
Have some fun.

702
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:57,590
You gotta get some fun out of life.

703
00:55:57,680 --> 00:56:00,399
You gonna beat yourself to death
at 19?

704
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:02,869
A pussycat like you? Come here.

705
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:08,917
- I'll talk to you again.
- Okay.

706
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,036
Put that money away.
Don't let her see it.

707
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:12,553
I'll talk to her.

708
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:15,753
I'll talk to you.

709
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:18,835
Let's go.

710
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:22,990
She's beautiful. How come you...

711
00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:29,519
Stay away from her. You hear?

712
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:31,554
She's not for you.

713
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:45,428
COCHABAMBA, BOLIVIA

714
00:56:57,280 --> 00:57:00,238
So, this and my other factory,
I can guarantee production...

715
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:04,233
of 200 kilos refined
every month of the year.

716
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:06,830
The problem is,
I have no steady market.

717
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:10,196
Basically, what I'm looking for
is somebody in the States...

718
00:57:10,280 --> 00:57:13,511
who can share the risk with me,
somebody who can guarantee...

719
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:17,639
to buy from me, say,
150 kilos a month.

720
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:22,157
That's a big commitment, Mr. Sosa.
Something like that...

721
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:25,430
Too bad Frank's not here.
You should talk to him.

722
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:28,478
- It would've been nice if he'd come.
- He would like to come...

723
00:57:28,560 --> 00:57:32,951
but with his trial coming up,
it's hard to leave the country.

724
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:36,316
- So he sent you instead?
- Something like that.

725
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:38,550
We'll talk at my house, shall we?

726
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:42,436
You got good stuff here.
Class-A shit.

727
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:06,995
This Lopez guarantees
to buy 150 kilos from me...

728
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:08,308
every month of the year.

729
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:09,549
He picks it up here.

730
00:58:09,640 --> 00:58:11,790
I can sell it to him
for as little as...

731
00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:16,950
$7,000 a key.
You can't do better than that.

732
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:20,479
But then we got to take the risk
of moving it.

733
00:58:20,680 --> 00:58:23,513
We'll be cutting out the Colombians.
Know what that means?

734
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:25,431
That means we have
to go to war with them.

735
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:28,557
We cut out the Colombians,
we take risks on both sides.

736
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:30,837
Why don't we split the risk?

737
00:58:32,440 --> 00:58:35,830
You guarantee your delivery,
say, as far as Panama...

738
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:38,312
we take it from there.

739
00:58:40,560 --> 00:58:43,836
Panama is risky. It costs me more.

740
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:49,513
Panama I can sell for $13,500 a key.

741
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:53,154
$13,500? What, are you nuts?

742
00:58:54,680 --> 00:58:58,150
$13,500? We still
got to take that shit to Florida.

743
00:58:58,240 --> 00:59:00,276
<i>Do you know</i>
<i>what that's like these days?</i>

744
00:59:00,360 --> 00:59:02,351
You got the Navy everywhere.

745
00:59:02,520 --> 00:59:06,672
You got frogmen. You got EC-2s
with the satellite-tracking shit.

746
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:10,397
You got the fucking Bell 209
assault choppers up the ass.

747
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:13,269
We're losing one
out of every nine loads.

748
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:16,998
That's no duckwalk anymore,
let me tell you.

749
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:18,599
Forget about $13,500.

750
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,639
What do you suggest
that is reasonable?

751
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,956
Excuse me. One moment.

752
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:38,470
What the fuck's the matter with you?

753
00:59:38,560 --> 00:59:40,152
Are you negotiating for Frank Lopez?

754
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:42,390
Don't worry about it. Take it easy.

755
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:45,392
I'm not worried about it.
You should worry about it.

756
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:48,679
If he wants to make a deal,
it's up to him, not you.

757
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:50,273
We're doing this one deal.
That's it.

758
00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:52,191
Fuck you. How's that?

759
00:59:53,320 --> 00:59:54,958
- Fuck you.
- Fuck you.

760
00:59:55,080 --> 00:59:57,719
You need to open your eyes
and keep your mouth shut.

761
00:59:57,800 --> 01:00:00,598
That's it. Let it go at that.
Don't worry about it.

762
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:03,831
Your head's in the wrong place.
You must watch out for yourself.

763
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:05,069
<i>Why not talk to him?</i>

764
01:00:05,160 --> 01:00:07,037
<i>You think he wants</i>
<i>to give you the money?</i>

765
01:00:07,120 --> 01:00:08,519
Shut the fuck up.

766
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:10,591
I'm doing the talking here, not you.

767
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:13,914
You're here to watch my back.
Watch my back.

768
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:17,231
Better than your front,
let me tell you.

769
01:00:17,320 --> 01:00:18,719
<i>That's easier to watch.</i>

770
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:20,153
Close your mouth.

771
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:23,637
I can't wait to see what Frank's
gonna react to this one.

772
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:26,668
Just shut up.
I'm doing the talking here.

773
01:00:27,880 --> 01:00:30,235
Now where were we?
Panama.

774
01:00:30,680 --> 01:00:32,830
You're looking for a partner, right?

775
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:35,639
Something like that.

776
01:00:35,720 --> 01:00:39,076
Look, Mr. Sosa,
we're getting ahead of ourselves.

777
01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:43,759
I am down on Frank's authority
to buy 200 keys, that's it.

778
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,195
That's my limit. I got no right.

779
01:00:46,280 --> 01:00:49,238
- Nobody got no right to negotiate...
- Let the man finish, okay?

780
01:00:49,320 --> 01:00:51,914
Let him propose a proposition,
then we can talk more.

781
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:53,911
You got no authority here.

782
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,673
I started you in this business,
so shut the fuck up.

783
01:00:56,760 --> 01:01:00,594
- Frank is gonna love it.
- That's up to Frank, not you!

784
01:01:04,040 --> 01:01:05,996
I'm sorry about this, Mr. Sosa.

785
01:01:06,440 --> 01:01:07,919
No, it is all right.

786
01:01:08,440 --> 01:01:11,557
You're right.
Maybe you should talk to Frank.

787
01:01:14,320 --> 01:01:15,389
Well, good.

788
01:01:16,680 --> 01:01:19,672
I don't think it's something
I want to do on an overseas phone.

789
01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:24,670
But as soon as I get back to Miami,
I will talk to Frank personally.

790
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:26,749
Good.

791
01:01:27,480 --> 01:01:29,789
My associates can escort you
to my chopper...

792
01:01:29,880 --> 01:01:31,518
<i>to take you to Santa Cruz.</i>

793
01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:34,558
<i>I have a jet there.</i>
<i>You'll be in Miami in five hours.</i>

794
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:37,518
You'll be back here tomorrow
in time for lunch.

795
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:40,075
Good.

796
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:45,318
Good talking to you.

797
01:01:46,320 --> 01:01:48,356
Why not leave your friend here?

798
01:01:48,440 --> 01:01:51,113
While you're gone, he can tell me
how to run my business.

799
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:54,158
- I think Frank wants to see him.
- No, that's okay.

800
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:57,755
You tell Frank I'm keeping this guy
on ice for him.

801
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:01,879
I guess so.

802
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:06,752
Let's finish our lunch.

803
01:02:11,080 --> 01:02:13,196
I have to hand it to you, Mr. Sosa.

804
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:16,670
You got everything a man could want.

805
01:02:18,560 --> 01:02:21,233
I like you, Tony.
There is no lying in you.

806
01:02:22,760 --> 01:02:26,753
Unfortunately, I don't feel the same
about the rest of your organization.

807
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:32,310
What do you mean by that, Mr. Sosa?

808
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:35,269
I'm talking about Omar Suarez.

809
01:02:37,880 --> 01:02:41,236
This garbage was recognized
by my associate at lunch...

810
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:44,435
<i>from several years ago in New York.</i>

811
01:02:48,560 --> 01:02:50,596
He was an informer for the police.

812
01:03:07,720 --> 01:03:11,793
He put Vito Duval and Nello
and Gino Ramos away for life.

813
01:03:16,240 --> 01:03:18,959
<i>So how do I know</i>
<i>you're not a</i> chivato<i>, too, Tony?</i>

814
01:03:25,720 --> 01:03:27,870
Let's get this straight now.

815
01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:33,513
I've never fucked anybody over
who didn't have it coming.

816
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:35,079
You got that?

817
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:39,629
All I have in this world
is my balls and my word.

818
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:42,991
I don't break them for no one,
you understand?

819
01:03:44,080 --> 01:03:46,594
That piece of shit up there,
I never liked him...

820
01:03:46,680 --> 01:03:48,113
I never trusted him.

821
01:03:48,320 --> 01:03:50,231
For all I know, he had me set up...

822
01:03:50,320 --> 01:03:52,595
and had my friend
Angel Fernandez killed.

823
01:03:52,680 --> 01:03:54,989
But that's history.
I'm here, he's not.

824
01:03:55,080 --> 01:03:57,355
You want to go on with me, say it.

825
01:03:57,440 --> 01:04:00,079
You don't, then you make a move.

826
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:08,080
I think you speak from the heart,
Montana.

827
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:09,513
<i>But I say to myself...</i>

828
01:04:10,560 --> 01:04:12,471
this Lopez, your boss...

829
01:04:13,480 --> 01:04:16,233
he had <i>chivatos</i> like that
working for him.

830
01:04:17,120 --> 01:04:18,678
His judgment stinks.

831
01:04:21,080 --> 01:04:22,991
So I think to myself...

832
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:26,278
how many other mistakes
has this Lopez guy made?

833
01:04:28,600 --> 01:04:32,388
How can I trust his organization?
You tell me, Tony.

834
01:04:34,640 --> 01:04:37,393
Frank is smart, you know?

835
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:41,910
You can't blame him for that animal.

836
01:04:43,080 --> 01:04:45,753
It's a crazy business we're in,
you know?

837
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:48,479
That could happen to anyone,
even you.

838
01:04:54,680 --> 01:04:57,433
Why don't I go back
and talk to Frank...

839
01:04:58,360 --> 01:04:59,793
and work it out?

840
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:02,517
I'll fix things between us.

841
01:05:04,360 --> 01:05:05,918
You got my word on that.

842
01:05:07,480 --> 01:05:10,233
I think you and me,
we can work this thing out...

843
01:05:10,840 --> 01:05:13,149
we do business together
for a long time.

844
01:05:15,080 --> 01:05:16,354
Just remember...

845
01:05:17,320 --> 01:05:19,390
I'll only tell you one time...

846
01:05:20,600 --> 01:05:22,431
don't fuck me, Tony.

847
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:26,871
Don't you ever try to fuck me.

848
01:05:40,160 --> 01:05:41,388
You what?

849
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:46,876
You made a deal
for fucking $18 million...

850
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:48,234
without even checking with me?

851
01:05:48,320 --> 01:05:50,311
Are you crazy, Montana?
Are you crazy?

852
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:52,118
<i>- Coño.</i> Take it easy.
<i>- Coño</i>, my ass!

853
01:05:52,200 --> 01:05:55,192
At $10,500 a key. It's <i>puro.</i>

854
01:05:56,680 --> 01:05:58,910
You can't lose money. No way.

855
01:06:00,840 --> 01:06:04,196
We make $75 million on this deal.

856
01:06:05,040 --> 01:06:07,110
$75 million.

857
01:06:08,280 --> 01:06:10,032
That is serious money.

858
01:06:10,320 --> 01:06:12,072
What is Sosa going to do...

859
01:06:12,160 --> 01:06:14,355
when I don't come up
with the first $5 million?

860
01:06:14,440 --> 01:06:17,113
What is he going to do?
Will he send me a bill?

861
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:20,510
He'll send a hit squad up here!
There'll be a war in the street.

862
01:06:20,600 --> 01:06:24,195
Relax! Take it easy.
I'm in tight with Sosa.

863
01:06:25,960 --> 01:06:28,952
You short a couple of million,
I go on the street for you.

864
01:06:29,120 --> 01:06:30,917
I make a couple of moves...

865
01:06:31,600 --> 01:06:33,875
a million here, a million there,
you got it.

866
01:06:39,400 --> 01:06:41,630
You've been making moves
on your own?

867
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:46,638
I got ears, you know? I hear things.

868
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:53,118
What do you hear about Echevierra
and the Diaz brothers?

869
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:55,316
<i>What about Gomez?</i>

870
01:06:55,400 --> 01:06:57,630
<i>What'll he do</i>
<i>when you start moving 2,000 keys...</i>

871
01:06:57,720 --> 01:07:01,474
Fuck Gaspar Gomez
and fuck the Diaz brothers!

872
01:07:01,560 --> 01:07:02,709
<i>Fuck 'em all!</i>

873
01:07:03,480 --> 01:07:05,710
I'll bury those cockroaches!

874
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:08,918
What they ever do for us?

875
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:19,278
Look, Frank, the time has come.

876
01:07:20,720 --> 01:07:22,312
We gotta expand.

877
01:07:23,080 --> 01:07:25,833
The whole operation. Distribution.

878
01:07:27,080 --> 01:07:29,992
New York, Chicago, LA.

879
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:34,353
We gotta set our own mark
and enforce it.

880
01:07:35,200 --> 01:07:36,792
We gotta think big now.

881
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:42,474
Think big.

882
01:07:48,240 --> 01:07:49,878
<i>Like your friend Sosa.</i>

883
01:07:52,160 --> 01:07:55,391
Let me tell you something
about that greaseball cocksucker.

884
01:07:55,920 --> 01:07:58,388
He is a snake, that's what he is.

885
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:03,948
<i>You turn your back on him,</i>
<i>he'll stick it in.</i>

886
01:08:04,760 --> 01:08:06,751
<i>You don't trust a guy like that.</i>

887
01:08:08,200 --> 01:08:10,350
You want me to believe...

888
01:08:11,040 --> 01:08:14,953
Omar was a stoolie
because Sosa said so?

889
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:16,919
You bought that line?

890
01:08:18,160 --> 01:08:20,879
<i>Maybe I made a mistake</i>
<i>sending you down there.</i>

891
01:08:22,280 --> 01:08:25,158
Maybe you and Sosa
know something I don't know.

892
01:08:28,360 --> 01:08:29,475
Like what?

893
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:31,993
Like what?

894
01:08:33,560 --> 01:08:35,596
You tell me, "Like what."

895
01:08:39,640 --> 01:08:42,074
You calling me a liar, Frank?

896
01:08:43,080 --> 01:08:44,752
That what you're calling me?

897
01:08:50,520 --> 01:08:54,115
Let's just say I want things
to stay the way they are for now.

898
01:08:57,320 --> 01:08:59,788
You stall your deal with Sosa.

899
01:09:01,440 --> 01:09:02,668
Stall it?

900
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:08,359
Okay, boss.

901
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:09,989
Come on.

902
01:09:12,400 --> 01:09:13,549
I am the boss.

903
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:17,189
Sure, you're the boss.
Hey, Tony.

904
01:09:21,400 --> 01:09:23,868
Remember I told you
when you started...

905
01:09:24,040 --> 01:09:26,429
the guys who last
in this business...

906
01:09:27,280 --> 01:09:29,396
are the guys who fly straight...

907
01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:32,073
<i>low-key, quiet.</i>

908
01:09:33,320 --> 01:09:35,276
<i>And the guys who want it all...</i>

909
01:09:35,960 --> 01:09:39,111
<i>chicas</i>, champagne, flash...

910
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:42,399
they don't last.

911
01:09:43,840 --> 01:09:45,068
You finished?

912
01:09:45,960 --> 01:09:47,109
Can I go now?

913
01:10:08,520 --> 01:10:10,158
Hi, there.

914
01:10:17,200 --> 01:10:18,758
You just missed Frank.

915
01:10:21,800 --> 01:10:22,869
Too bad.

916
01:10:25,160 --> 01:10:27,151
Only I didn't come to see Frank.

917
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:31,438
This is not the time
or the place, Tony.

918
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:34,388
Make an appointment.
That's okay.

919
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:37,472
I got something important
I want to talk to you about.

920
01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:46,548
<i>So why don't we have</i>
<i>a couple of drinks...</i>

921
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:48,353
<i>act normal...</i>

922
01:10:50,600 --> 01:10:52,272
<i>and just take it easy.</i>

923
01:10:53,080 --> 01:10:54,911
<i>Come on. I like Scotch.</i>

924
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:02,751
- Sure. Why not?
- Okay. I won't bite you.

925
01:11:05,280 --> 01:11:07,191
We're all normal here.

926
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:14,349
I heard you and Frank
aren't working together anymore.

927
01:11:14,720 --> 01:11:15,994
That's right.

928
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:22,550
I think it's easier, don't you?

929
01:11:23,280 --> 01:11:24,918
Makes things easier.

930
01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:28,429
Thank you.

931
01:11:29,720 --> 01:11:31,756
Here's to "the land of opportunity."

932
01:11:32,760 --> 01:11:34,159
For you, maybe.

933
01:11:39,040 --> 01:11:40,189
You like kids?

934
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:42,989
Kids?

935
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:45,750
Kids. You know, kids. Little kids.

936
01:11:47,440 --> 01:11:49,476
Sure. Why not?

937
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:51,273
As long as there's a nurse.

938
01:11:51,360 --> 01:11:54,193
Good, 'cause I like kids, too.

939
01:11:56,080 --> 01:12:00,039
I like them. Boys, girls.
Don't matter to me.

940
01:12:03,200 --> 01:12:05,236
Frank's gonna be back any minute.

941
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:07,159
Come here.

942
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:14,909
Sit here.

943
01:12:15,760 --> 01:12:18,911
<i>I want to talk to you. Sit down.</i>
<i>I'm not gonna bite you.</i>

944
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:26,358
Okay, here's the story.

945
01:12:29,520 --> 01:12:32,557
I come from the gutter. I know that.

946
01:12:34,840 --> 01:12:36,432
I got no education...

947
01:12:37,280 --> 01:12:38,759
but that's okay.

948
01:12:40,040 --> 01:12:42,076
I know the street...

949
01:12:42,160 --> 01:12:44,549
and I'm making
all the right connections.

950
01:12:45,640 --> 01:12:49,030
With the right woman,
there's no stopping me.

951
01:12:49,800 --> 01:12:51,791
I could go right to the top.

952
01:12:53,840 --> 01:12:54,875
Anyway...

953
01:12:55,720 --> 01:12:57,790
what I got to tell you is this:

954
01:12:59,880 --> 01:13:01,359
I like you.

955
01:13:04,520 --> 01:13:07,193
I liked you
the first time I laid eyes on you.

956
01:13:10,280 --> 01:13:12,748
I said, "She's a tiger.

957
01:13:15,080 --> 01:13:16,957
"She'll belong to me."

958
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:22,153
Anyway...

959
01:13:23,400 --> 01:13:25,118
I want you to marry me.

960
01:13:28,080 --> 01:13:30,878
I want you to be
the mother of my children.

961
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:36,512
Me? Marry you?

962
01:13:36,600 --> 01:13:37,794
That's right.

963
01:13:42,320 --> 01:13:43,992
What about Frank, Tony?

964
01:13:44,680 --> 01:13:46,193
<i>What will you do about Frank?</i>

965
01:13:46,280 --> 01:13:49,670
Frank is not gonna last, okay?
He's finished.

966
01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:54,388
Just think about it, okay?

967
01:13:55,640 --> 01:13:57,915
I want you to really think about it.

968
01:14:00,440 --> 01:14:03,318
I'll go now. Take care.

969
01:14:11,480 --> 01:14:13,232
All your enemies are gone.

970
01:14:14,680 --> 01:14:17,148
- Mr. Montana. How are you?
- Hello.

971
01:14:24,600 --> 01:14:26,477
What the fuck she doing here?

972
01:14:26,600 --> 01:14:30,752
Come on, man. She's just
dancing. Come on. Take it easy.

973
01:14:43,360 --> 01:14:46,830
- It's just a disco.
- Who's that guy she's with?

974
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,275
He's some guy who works
for Luco. He's nobody.

975
01:14:50,360 --> 01:14:51,998
- He's harmless.
- Works for Luco?

976
01:14:52,080 --> 01:14:54,435
Yeah. Forget him.

977
01:14:56,280 --> 01:15:00,034
Hello, Tony. You remember me?

978
01:15:02,360 --> 01:15:06,069
Bernstein. Mel Bernstein, right?

979
01:15:06,920 --> 01:15:08,956
Chief Detective, Narcotics.

980
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:12,394
That's right, yeah.
I think we should talk.

981
01:15:13,040 --> 01:15:15,554
Talk?
What are we going to talk about?

982
01:15:16,080 --> 01:15:18,958
I ain't killed nobody, not lately.

983
01:15:19,360 --> 01:15:21,078
No, not lately.

984
01:15:21,160 --> 01:15:24,755
What about ancient history,
like Emilio Rebenga?

985
01:15:24,840 --> 01:15:27,877
Or a bunch of whacked-out Indians
at the Sun Ray Motel?

986
01:15:29,400 --> 01:15:31,436
Whoever's giving you
your information...

987
01:15:31,520 --> 01:15:33,158
is taking you for a long ride.

988
01:15:34,680 --> 01:15:36,955
Tony, baby, we gonna talk...

989
01:15:37,040 --> 01:15:39,838
or am I gonna bust
your wiseass spic balls...

990
01:15:39,920 --> 01:15:41,239
here and now?

991
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:48,393
Keep your eye on her.

992
01:15:49,400 --> 01:15:50,879
I'll do that.
Okay.

993
01:15:52,560 --> 01:15:54,471
- My office.
- Good.

994
01:16:01,920 --> 01:16:05,390
The word on the street is
you're bringing in a lot of <i>yeyo.</i>

995
01:16:05,640 --> 01:16:08,029
That means you're not
a small-time punk anymore...

996
01:16:08,120 --> 01:16:09,917
you're public property now.

997
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,719
Supreme Court says
that your privacy can be invaded.

998
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:14,472
Okay. How much?

999
01:16:15,960 --> 01:16:17,279
How much?

1000
01:16:17,960 --> 01:16:20,315
There's an answer to that, too.

1001
01:16:26,640 --> 01:16:27,959
<i>Here's how much.</i>

1002
01:16:29,160 --> 01:16:30,388
Can you see it?

1003
01:16:32,360 --> 01:16:34,157
- Big number.
- Yeah!

1004
01:16:34,320 --> 01:16:37,118
That's on a monthly basis,
same thing every month.

1005
01:16:37,560 --> 01:16:39,198
You know how this works?

1006
01:16:41,040 --> 01:16:42,393
No. You tell me.

1007
01:16:42,960 --> 01:16:45,269
We tell you
who's moving against you...

1008
01:16:45,640 --> 01:16:48,313
and we shake down
who you want shaken down.

1009
01:16:49,160 --> 01:16:52,357
Let's say that you got
a real problem making a collection.

1010
01:16:53,680 --> 01:16:55,511
And then we step in for you.

1011
01:16:55,920 --> 01:16:58,150
Got eight killers with badges
working for me.

1012
01:16:58,240 --> 01:17:01,198
When they hit, it hurts.
Same thing works the other way.

1013
01:17:01,280 --> 01:17:03,271
You feed me a bust now and then.

1014
01:17:03,640 --> 01:17:06,757
<i>Some cowboy setting himself up</i>
<i>in business.</i>

1015
01:17:07,400 --> 01:17:09,550
Small fry, you know?

1016
01:17:13,200 --> 01:17:14,758
We like snacks.

1017
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:18,231
How do I know you're the last cop
I'm gonna have to grease?

1018
01:17:18,920 --> 01:17:23,436
What about Fort Lauderdale?
Metro? DEA?

1019
01:17:24,240 --> 01:17:27,038
How do I know what rock
they're gonna crawl out from under?

1020
01:17:27,120 --> 01:17:31,159
Well, that's not my business, Tony.
We don't cross no lines.

1021
01:17:32,440 --> 01:17:36,877
You think I want this conversation
going any farther than this table?

1022
01:17:37,320 --> 01:17:40,437
My guys got families.
They're legitimate cops.

1023
01:17:40,720 --> 01:17:42,631
I don't want
to see them embarrassed.

1024
01:17:42,720 --> 01:17:44,517
If they're embarrassed,
they'll suffer.

1025
01:17:44,600 --> 01:17:47,194
If they suffer,
they'll make you suffer.

1026
01:17:49,680 --> 01:17:51,955
<i>You understand</i>
<i>what I'm talking about?</i>

1027
01:18:02,200 --> 01:18:03,792
Thanks for the drink.

1028
01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:07,959
By the way...

1029
01:18:08,960 --> 01:18:10,871
I got a vacation coming up.

1030
01:18:11,080 --> 01:18:13,469
I'm gonna take the wife
to London, England.

1031
01:18:13,560 --> 01:18:14,959
We've never been there.

1032
01:18:15,040 --> 01:18:18,191
So throw in a couple
of round-trip tickets, first class.

1033
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:27,917
You gotta smile more, Tony.
You gotta enjoy yourself.

1034
01:18:28,520 --> 01:18:30,829
Every day above ground
is a good day.

1035
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:44,956
- Hello.
- Hello.

1036
01:18:46,360 --> 01:18:48,351
Yeah. Now that's the idea.

1037
01:18:48,480 --> 01:18:50,152
Okay, Mel.

1038
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:54,231
You think about what I said?

1039
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:55,994
About the kids?

1040
01:18:57,360 --> 01:19:01,672
- You know, you are really nuts.
- I'm nuts about you.

1041
01:19:02,480 --> 01:19:04,755
Why don't you find your own girl?

1042
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:06,115
My own girl?
Yeah.

1043
01:19:06,200 --> 01:19:09,112
That's what I'm doing.
Do it somewhere else.

1044
01:19:09,200 --> 01:19:11,350
Maybe I don't hear
so good sometimes.

1045
01:19:11,480 --> 01:19:13,675
You won't hear anything
if you go on like this.

1046
01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:14,909
Will you do something?

1047
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,639
You're fucking right
I'm going to do something!

1048
01:19:18,840 --> 01:19:20,717
I'm giving you orders. Blow!

1049
01:19:20,840 --> 01:19:24,355
Orders? You giving me orders?

1050
01:19:29,720 --> 01:19:31,950
The only thing in this world...

1051
01:19:32,040 --> 01:19:35,510
that gives orders is balls.
You got that?

1052
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:38,149
<i>Balls.</i>

1053
01:19:48,160 --> 01:19:49,309
Let's go.

1054
01:19:56,800 --> 01:19:57,869
Elvira.

1055
01:19:59,240 --> 01:20:00,912
When you gonna learn?

1056
01:20:03,560 --> 01:20:07,109
Looking good, honey.
Keep up the bad work.

1057
01:20:08,800 --> 01:20:10,791
That cocksucker.
What happened?

1058
01:20:11,680 --> 01:20:15,355
- He put that prick Bernstein on me.
- Who? Lopez did?

1059
01:20:16,840 --> 01:20:17,955
How do you know?

1060
01:20:18,040 --> 01:20:20,315
Who else knew about Rebenga?
Omar?

1061
01:20:20,920 --> 01:20:22,512
<i>He's fertilizer.</i>

1062
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,434
He's letting me know
he's got weight on me.

1063
01:20:28,480 --> 01:20:30,072
I'll tell you what, man.

1064
01:20:30,160 --> 01:20:32,993
<i>You know our little trip</i>
<i>we've been planning to New York?</i>

1065
01:20:33,080 --> 01:20:34,752
<i>It might be a good time.</i>

1066
01:20:51,160 --> 01:20:53,037
Wait. Where you going?

1067
01:21:17,760 --> 01:21:19,432
Welcome to my private room.

1068
01:21:19,520 --> 01:21:22,114
- Your private room.
- This is my private room.

1069
01:21:22,200 --> 01:21:25,715
<i>I got a beautiful, nice,</i>
<i>white lounge chair for you.</i>

1070
01:21:30,640 --> 01:21:32,915
Gina, you taste so <i>muy bueno.</i>

1071
01:21:38,120 --> 01:21:39,951
What are you doing?
Shut up!

1072
01:21:40,040 --> 01:21:43,555
We wasn't doing nothing!
Fernando, wait!

1073
01:21:43,880 --> 01:21:45,199
Get out!

1074
01:21:47,880 --> 01:21:49,199
Damn you!

1075
01:21:49,280 --> 01:21:50,952
You think he's cute?

1076
01:21:51,040 --> 01:21:53,395
I saw him putting his hand
all over your ass.

1077
01:21:53,480 --> 01:21:55,277
My kid sister in a toilet.

1078
01:21:55,360 --> 01:21:56,554
It's none of your business.

1079
01:21:56,640 --> 01:21:58,949
None of my business?
The fuck it ain't!

1080
01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:01,270
Don't tell me what to do!
I'll tell you!

1081
01:22:01,360 --> 01:22:03,271
Listen to me. Come here.

1082
01:22:04,280 --> 01:22:09,308
I catch you here again, I'm gonna
wipe you all over the fucking place.

1083
01:22:09,640 --> 01:22:12,473
Yeah? Go ahead!
Do it now. I want to see it.

1084
01:22:12,560 --> 01:22:14,755
- I want to see it now, big shot.
- Don't push me.

1085
01:22:14,840 --> 01:22:18,230
- I want to see it now!
- Don't push me! Get outta here!

1086
01:22:18,480 --> 01:22:21,916
- Go outside.
- You got some nerve, Tony!

1087
01:22:22,480 --> 01:22:24,914
You think you can
tell me what to do?

1088
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,878
You can't tell me what to do.
I'm not a baby anymore.

1089
01:22:27,960 --> 01:22:30,713
I'll do what I want to do,
see whoever I want to see.

1090
01:22:30,800 --> 01:22:33,758
And if I want to fuck them,
then I'll fuck them!

1091
01:22:35,320 --> 01:22:37,880
Fucking, man! Come on, man.

1092
01:22:41,880 --> 01:22:44,348
What the fuck you want?
You want something?

1093
01:22:45,280 --> 01:22:47,430
No. Don't touch me.

1094
01:22:49,520 --> 01:22:51,112
- No.
- We've got to get out of here.

1095
01:22:51,200 --> 01:22:54,909
Not there.
I don't want to go out there.

1096
01:22:55,640 --> 01:22:57,835
<i>Another great night here</i>
<i>at the Babylon?</i>

1097
01:22:57,920 --> 01:22:59,797
<i>Okay. All right!</i>

1098
01:23:00,040 --> 01:23:02,554
<i>Do another gram,</i>
<i>you'll all be babbling on.</i>

1099
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:06,193
<i>Is that coke in your bra,</i>
<i>or are you just glad to see me?</i>

1100
01:23:06,280 --> 01:23:08,236
<i>A little bit of hope, I'm sure, yes.</i>

1101
01:23:08,320 --> 01:23:11,312
<i>I'm in a good mood. I was depressed</i>
<i>when I got up this morning.</i>

1102
01:23:11,400 --> 01:23:14,198
<i>I had a dry dream,</i>
<i>but I'm better now.</i>

1103
01:23:28,840 --> 01:23:31,070
<i>I do</i> Laurel and Hardy
<i>in Spanish, too.</i>

1104
01:23:33,600 --> 01:23:35,636
<i>That's the height of culture,</i>
<i>I assure you.</i>

1105
01:23:35,720 --> 01:23:39,030
<i>But my favorite Cuban of all time</i>
<i>has to be Ricky Ricardo.</i>

1106
01:23:39,320 --> 01:23:41,276
<i>Mr. Babalu himself.</i>

1107
01:23:41,360 --> 01:23:43,112
<i>He had the same problem</i>
<i>for 10 years.</i>

1108
01:23:43,200 --> 01:23:45,760
<i>"Lucy, don't come down to the club."</i>

1109
01:24:16,360 --> 01:24:19,352
He's your brother. He loves you.
That's why he did it.

1110
01:24:19,440 --> 01:24:21,431
All right? He cares about you.

1111
01:24:21,520 --> 01:24:23,988
To him,
you're still his little sister.

1112
01:24:24,120 --> 01:24:27,396
That's the problem.
He still treats me like I'm a baby.

1113
01:24:27,480 --> 01:24:28,959
I'm 20 years old now.

1114
01:24:29,040 --> 01:24:31,793
- I'm not anybody's baby.
- You're so grown-up.

1115
01:24:34,520 --> 01:24:37,751
Come on, Gina.
Put yourself in his place, okay?

1116
01:24:37,840 --> 01:24:41,310
Right now, you happen
to be the best thing in his life.

1117
01:24:41,400 --> 01:24:45,154
The only thing that's any good,
that's pure.

1118
01:24:46,040 --> 01:24:48,838
Of course he doesn't want you
mixing with those people...

1119
01:24:48,920 --> 01:24:50,239
growing up to be like him.

1120
01:24:51,480 --> 01:24:54,677
He has this father thing for you.
Feels like he has to protect you.

1121
01:24:54,760 --> 01:24:56,432
Protect me against what?

1122
01:24:56,720 --> 01:25:00,190
Against guys like that asshole
you were dancing with tonight.

1123
01:25:00,280 --> 01:25:04,193
I like Fernando.
He's a fun guy and he's nice.

1124
01:25:05,720 --> 01:25:08,518
And he knows how to treat a woman.
All right?

1125
01:25:08,800 --> 01:25:10,552
- He knows how to treat a woman?
- Yes.

1126
01:25:10,640 --> 01:25:12,631
By taking her to the toilet
to make out?

1127
01:25:12,720 --> 01:25:16,599
<i>You've been a great audience.</i>
<i>I got a special treat for you.</i>

1128
01:25:16,680 --> 01:25:18,193
<i>Here's a guy I found in the jungle.</i>

1129
01:25:18,280 --> 01:25:21,033
<i>From Caracas, Venezuela.</i>
<i>He's unlike anything you've seen.</i>

1130
01:25:21,120 --> 01:25:24,590
<i>Give a warm Babylon welcome</i>
<i>to the one and only Octavio!</i>

1131
01:25:48,880 --> 01:25:52,270
Look around. Go out with someone
who has something on the ball...

1132
01:25:52,360 --> 01:25:54,954
- who's going somewhere in life.
- Like who?

1133
01:25:55,640 --> 01:25:58,871
For instance, someone who's got
a real job, like a banker.

1134
01:25:58,960 --> 01:26:01,713
Or, or a doctor, a lawyer...
What about you?

1135
01:26:04,040 --> 01:26:07,077
- What are you talking about?
- Why don't you take me out?

1136
01:26:07,160 --> 01:26:08,991
Are you crazy?

1137
01:26:09,080 --> 01:26:10,991
I see the way you look at me,
Manolo.

1138
01:26:11,280 --> 01:26:13,999
Do you think I'm blind? I see.
Come on.

1139
01:26:14,440 --> 01:26:16,317
What?
Look, Gina...

1140
01:26:17,760 --> 01:26:20,274
Tony and I are like brothers,
all right?

1141
01:26:20,640 --> 01:26:22,198
You're his kid sister.

1142
01:26:22,280 --> 01:26:23,872
- So what?
- That's where it ends.

1143
01:26:24,640 --> 01:26:27,632
- That's where it stays.
- Are you afraid of Tony?

1144
01:26:28,520 --> 01:26:31,876
- You afraid of Tony's kid sister?
- I'm not afraid of anybody!

1145
01:26:32,200 --> 01:26:34,031
<i>That's not the point here!</i>

1146
01:28:46,880 --> 01:28:48,757
It's not for me. Don't look at me.

1147
01:28:48,840 --> 01:28:51,798
How do you know?
'Cause I'm not here.

1148
01:28:51,880 --> 01:28:53,677
Really? Then where are you?

1149
01:28:56,560 --> 01:28:58,039
Shit, you're weird.

1150
01:28:58,120 --> 01:29:00,350
- I'm weird?
- Hello?

1151
01:29:00,440 --> 01:29:02,749
<i>Hello, Miriam?</i>
Tony!

1152
01:29:02,840 --> 01:29:05,957
<i>Put Manny on, okay?</i>
Okay. Just a second.

1153
01:29:06,280 --> 01:29:07,508
It's Tony.

1154
01:29:10,400 --> 01:29:12,550
<i>What are you doing,</i>
<i>checking up on me?</i>

1155
01:29:12,640 --> 01:29:14,392
Get your clothes on and meet me...

1156
01:29:14,480 --> 01:29:16,596
in front of Lopez Motors
in 45 minutes.

1157
01:29:17,080 --> 01:29:20,152
What? What happened?
<i>Nothing we can't face.</i>

1158
01:29:20,760 --> 01:29:23,035
All right. I'll be there.

1159
01:29:23,120 --> 01:29:25,634
<i>You're still on the phone. Let's go.</i>

1160
01:29:25,720 --> 01:29:26,789
Take it easy, okay?

1161
01:29:26,880 --> 01:29:29,633
I'm leaving now. Fuck.

1162
01:29:30,200 --> 01:29:31,758
Nick?
Yeah, Tony.

1163
01:29:31,840 --> 01:29:34,070
This is what
I want you to do for me:

1164
01:29:35,440 --> 01:29:37,158
<i>You call Lopez.</i>

1165
01:29:37,640 --> 01:29:41,189
<i>Call him at his office</i>
<i>at 3:00 sharp.</i>

1166
01:29:42,040 --> 01:29:44,838
<i>And you tell him:</i>

1167
01:29:45,920 --> 01:29:47,990
<i>"We fucked up, he got away."</i>

1168
01:29:48,640 --> 01:29:51,074
Okay. Yeah.
Got it? What're you going to say?

1169
01:29:51,160 --> 01:29:52,991
"We fucked up. He got away."

1170
01:29:54,560 --> 01:29:56,357
What time?
3:00 sharp.

1171
01:29:58,560 --> 01:30:01,199
So when are we gonna make
some money on this thing?

1172
01:30:01,280 --> 01:30:04,113
<i>Six months to start</i>
<i>don't mean shit, Larry.</i>

1173
01:30:04,680 --> 01:30:07,831
<i>I'm not a Rockefeller, you know.</i>
<i>Not yet, anyway.</i>

1174
01:30:09,400 --> 01:30:11,038
<i>So you owe me.</i>

1175
01:30:12,200 --> 01:30:14,634
<i>Listen, go down</i>
<i>to the ball game tonight.</i>

1176
01:30:15,040 --> 01:30:18,191
<i>I couldn't make it. I got things.</i>
<i>I'll tell you about them.</i>

1177
01:30:19,120 --> 01:30:22,271
You're kidding? What was the score?
Three to two?

1178
01:30:23,600 --> 01:30:24,794
Mel, guess what?

1179
01:30:24,880 --> 01:30:26,632
My Little League team,
the Little Lopezers...

1180
01:30:26,720 --> 01:30:28,392
they won the division tonight.

1181
01:30:28,480 --> 01:30:30,710
That's great. Congratulations.

1182
01:30:31,080 --> 01:30:33,833
What'd you do, fix the umpire?

1183
01:30:36,600 --> 01:30:39,068
Jesus Christ.

1184
01:30:40,920 --> 01:30:42,751
<i>Tony, what happened to you?</i>

1185
01:30:45,480 --> 01:30:48,313
They wanted to spoil my $800 suit.

1186
01:30:49,360 --> 01:30:51,351
Who the fuck did this?

1187
01:30:51,960 --> 01:30:54,520
Hitters. I don't know.

1188
01:30:55,600 --> 01:30:57,670
Somebody must've brought them in.

1189
01:30:58,240 --> 01:30:59,992
I've never seen them before.

1190
01:31:00,400 --> 01:31:01,719
Hello, Mel.

1191
01:31:03,040 --> 01:31:04,758
Got an answer to this, too?

1192
01:31:05,760 --> 01:31:09,036
There always is, Tony.
I'll bet it was the Diaz brothers.

1193
01:31:09,120 --> 01:31:11,793
They got a beef going back
to the Sun Ray thing.

1194
01:31:12,960 --> 01:31:15,315
Maybe you're right, you know?

1195
01:31:17,240 --> 01:31:21,597
Anyway, I'm glad you made it, Tony.

1196
01:31:22,640 --> 01:31:25,598
We'll return the favor for you,
in spades.

1197
01:31:25,680 --> 01:31:28,319
I'll take care of this myself.

1198
01:31:33,920 --> 01:31:35,751
What is the gun for, Tony?

1199
01:31:36,640 --> 01:31:39,279
What, this? It's nothing.

1200
01:31:40,880 --> 01:31:44,953
I'm... How do you say? Paranoid.

1201
01:31:58,800 --> 01:32:00,518
You gonna answer, Frank?

1202
01:32:02,640 --> 01:32:06,155
It must be Elvira.
She got mad after we left the club.

1203
01:32:09,200 --> 01:32:10,997
I'll tell her you're not here, okay?

1204
01:32:11,080 --> 01:32:14,755
No, it's all right.
I'll talk to her.

1205
01:32:22,400 --> 01:32:23,549
Hello.

1206
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:33,390
It's all right. I'm gonna be home
in an hour. Don't worry.

1207
01:32:36,280 --> 01:32:39,352
Frank, you're a piece of shit.

1208
01:32:39,480 --> 01:32:42,950
- What are you talking about?
- You know what I'm talking about...

1209
01:32:43,040 --> 01:32:45,429
you fucking cockroach.

1210
01:32:45,560 --> 01:32:48,358
What are you talking about?
Listen to me.

1211
01:32:48,480 --> 01:32:50,596
You know what a <i>chazer</i> is, Frank?

1212
01:32:51,600 --> 01:32:54,478
<i>That's a pig</i>
<i>that don't fly straight.</i>

1213
01:32:55,520 --> 01:32:57,078
Neither do you, Frank.

1214
01:32:58,560 --> 01:33:01,279
Tony, why the fuck would I hurt you?

1215
01:33:01,640 --> 01:33:03,278
I brought you in.

1216
01:33:03,360 --> 01:33:05,794
So we had a few differences,
no big deal.

1217
01:33:07,080 --> 01:33:09,913
I gave you your start.
I was the one who believed in you.

1218
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,036
I stayed loyal to you.

1219
01:33:14,240 --> 01:33:17,596
I made what I could on the side,
but I never turned on you, Frank!

1220
01:33:18,240 --> 01:33:19,229
Never!

1221
01:33:22,840 --> 01:33:23,989
But you...

1222
01:33:27,400 --> 01:33:31,757
a man who ain't got his word
is a cockroach.

1223
01:33:35,200 --> 01:33:37,794
Mel. Do something, will you?

1224
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,560
It's your tree, Frank.
You're sitting in it.

1225
01:33:52,040 --> 01:33:55,112
All right, Tony. I was the one.

1226
01:34:01,600 --> 01:34:03,909
Please, give me a second chance.

1227
01:34:05,640 --> 01:34:08,393
Will you do that? Please?

1228
01:34:13,040 --> 01:34:16,510
Give me a second chance.
I'll give you $10 million.

1229
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:20,276
<i>Okay? $10 million.</i>

1230
01:34:20,880 --> 01:34:23,952
I got it in a vault
over there in Spain, Tony.

1231
01:34:24,040 --> 01:34:28,431
We go over there,
we get on a plane, and it's yours.

1232
01:34:29,080 --> 01:34:32,277
Okay? All of it. $10 million.

1233
01:34:33,120 --> 01:34:34,235
<i>Okay, Tony?</i>

1234
01:34:38,200 --> 01:34:39,474
Please, Tony?

1235
01:34:41,200 --> 01:34:44,272
Elvira? You want Elvira?

1236
01:34:45,040 --> 01:34:47,952
<i>You can have her. I'll go away.</i>
<i>I'm gonna disappear.</i>

1237
01:34:48,040 --> 01:34:51,476
You'll never see me again.
Please, Tony, I don't want to die.

1238
01:34:51,560 --> 01:34:53,437
I never did nothing to nobody.

1239
01:34:53,600 --> 01:34:56,398
No, you never did nothing to nobody.

1240
01:34:56,640 --> 01:34:58,517
You had somebody else do it for you.

1241
01:34:58,600 --> 01:34:59,874
Tony, I'm begging you.

1242
01:34:59,960 --> 01:35:03,589
- Get up! Get up now!
- Jesus! No! God!

1243
01:35:08,400 --> 01:35:11,915
Look. Tony, no!
Don't kill me, please.

1244
01:35:14,720 --> 01:35:16,119
I won't kill you.

1245
01:35:16,760 --> 01:35:18,671
- Christ, thank you.
- Get off my foot.

1246
01:35:18,760 --> 01:35:22,275
Thank you.
Manolo, shoot that piece of shit!

1247
01:35:22,560 --> 01:35:24,039
No! No!

1248
01:35:43,360 --> 01:35:46,158
Every dog has his day, Mel?

1249
01:35:46,240 --> 01:35:47,434
I told him...

1250
01:35:48,880 --> 01:35:50,677
it didn't make any sense...

1251
01:35:50,760 --> 01:35:54,435
clipping you when we had you
working for us. He wouldn't listen.

1252
01:35:55,200 --> 01:35:58,875
<i>He got hot tonight about the broad.</i>

1253
01:36:00,920 --> 01:36:02,319
He fucked up.

1254
01:36:03,040 --> 01:36:06,635
You, too, Mel. You fucked up.

1255
01:36:07,800 --> 01:36:09,392
Don't go too far, Tony.

1256
01:36:10,920 --> 01:36:13,593
I'm not, Mel. You are.

1257
01:36:22,080 --> 01:36:24,878
Fuck. You can't shoot a cop!

1258
01:36:26,360 --> 01:36:27,839
Whoever says you was one?

1259
01:36:27,920 --> 01:36:29,399
Wait a minute!

1260
01:36:31,400 --> 01:36:33,470
You let me go. I'll fix this up.

1261
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:37,913
Sure, Mel.
Maybe you can hand yourself...

1262
01:36:38,280 --> 01:36:41,511
one of them first-class tickets
to the Resurrection.

1263
01:36:41,960 --> 01:36:45,509
Fucking punk! Son of a bitch!

1264
01:36:47,200 --> 01:36:49,873
- So long, Mel. Have a good trip.
- Fuck you!

1265
01:36:56,400 --> 01:36:59,472
- Okay, come on.
- What about Ernie?

1266
01:37:09,160 --> 01:37:10,752
You want a job, Ernie?

1267
01:37:14,200 --> 01:37:17,237
- Sure, Tony.
- Okay, then you call me tomorrow.

1268
01:37:17,920 --> 01:37:19,672
Man, you got a job!

1269
01:37:20,560 --> 01:37:22,915
Tony! Thanks.

1270
01:37:57,080 --> 01:37:58,832
God, what's happened?

1271
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:02,353
Where's Frank?

1272
01:38:04,080 --> 01:38:05,718
Where do you think?

1273
01:38:10,760 --> 01:38:14,150
<i>Come on. Get your stuff.</i>

1274
01:38:14,640 --> 01:38:16,119
<i>You're coming with me.</i>

1275
01:42:41,840 --> 01:42:45,150
So you come to me
with some kind of thing. Okay.

1276
01:42:45,240 --> 01:42:47,151
<i>You propose it, I talk to you.</i>

1277
01:42:47,600 --> 01:42:50,751
<i>But we got a problem.</i>
<i>I can't pay more.</i>

1278
01:42:51,840 --> 01:42:54,718
I'm bringing in twice as much
as I ever did before.

1279
01:42:54,920 --> 01:42:58,151
We're doing $10 million,
$15 million a month. Come on.

1280
01:42:58,320 --> 01:43:00,276
That's serious money.

1281
01:43:00,560 --> 01:43:02,278
You bank boys gotta come down a bit.

1282
01:43:02,360 --> 01:43:03,349
No way.

1283
01:43:03,440 --> 01:43:07,069
- That's crazy. We can't do that.
- Then that's too bad.

1284
01:43:07,360 --> 01:43:10,511
- What am I gonna do?
- We're not a wholesale operation.

1285
01:43:10,600 --> 01:43:13,956
We're a legitimate bank.
The more cash you give me...

1286
01:43:14,200 --> 01:43:16,350
the harder it is for me to rinse.

1287
01:43:16,840 --> 01:43:18,637
That's a problem. I didn't know.

1288
01:43:18,720 --> 01:43:21,518
The fact is, I can't take any more
of your money...

1289
01:43:21,600 --> 01:43:23,830
unless I raise the rates on you.

1290
01:43:25,400 --> 01:43:27,152
- You gonna raise the...
- I gotta do it.

1291
01:43:27,240 --> 01:43:28,355
The IRS is coming...

1292
01:43:28,440 --> 01:43:31,000
Don't give me that shit! Let's talk.

1293
01:43:31,080 --> 01:43:32,069
I'm talking.

1294
01:43:32,160 --> 01:43:34,549
I go low, you go high.
I know the game.

1295
01:43:34,640 --> 01:43:37,074
- This is business talk.
- Let me explain something.

1296
01:43:37,160 --> 01:43:39,515
The IRS is coming down heavy
on South Florida.

1297
01:43:39,600 --> 01:43:41,909
There was a <i>Time Magazine</i> story
that didn't help.

1298
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:43,399
There's a recession.

1299
01:43:43,480 --> 01:43:45,710
I got stockholders
I got to be responsible for.

1300
01:43:45,800 --> 01:43:48,109
- I got to do it, Tony.
- You'll learn from him.

1301
01:43:48,200 --> 01:43:51,431
I got to go 10% on the first
$12 million in denominations of 20.

1302
01:43:51,520 --> 01:43:53,431
<i>I'll go 8% on your $10 bills...</i>

1303
01:43:53,520 --> 01:43:54,509
<i>6% on your fives.</i>

1304
01:43:54,600 --> 01:43:56,318
- We'll go somewhere else.
- That's it.

1305
01:43:56,400 --> 01:43:59,790
- There's no place else to go.
- Fuck you, man! Fuck you!

1306
01:43:59,880 --> 01:44:02,599
I'll fly the cash myself
to the Bahamas.

1307
01:44:03,080 --> 01:44:04,957
Once, maybe. Then what?

1308
01:44:06,120 --> 01:44:08,315
You'll trust some monkey
in a Bahamian bank...

1309
01:44:08,400 --> 01:44:10,391
with 20 million
of your hard-earned dollars?

1310
01:44:10,480 --> 01:44:12,232
Come on, Tony. Don't be a schmuck.

1311
01:44:12,600 --> 01:44:13,828
<i>Who else can you trust?</i>

1312
01:44:13,920 --> 01:44:16,593
<i>That's why you pay us so much.</i>
<i>You trust us.</i>

1313
01:44:21,200 --> 01:44:22,872
Did you hear that guy?

1314
01:44:23,240 --> 01:44:25,800
You got to listen to him.
You'll learn something.

1315
01:44:25,880 --> 01:44:27,029
Stay with us.

1316
01:44:27,120 --> 01:44:30,078
You're a well-liked customer.
You're in good hands with us.

1317
01:44:32,400 --> 01:44:34,675
And I got to run.
I'm safe but poor.

1318
01:44:36,040 --> 01:44:39,077
- How's married life treating you?
- Better than you are.

1319
01:44:40,520 --> 01:44:43,557
Say hello to the princess for me.
She's beautiful.

1320
01:44:43,640 --> 01:44:47,189
I'll see you. Take care.
You, too.

1321
01:45:00,040 --> 01:45:01,439
That prick!

1322
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:04,558
Fucking WASP whore.

1323
01:45:05,560 --> 01:45:08,916
Talking to me like I'm some <i>maricón</i>
who came over on a boat.

1324
01:45:10,240 --> 01:45:13,437
I tell you what. We don't need
that smiling motherfucker.

1325
01:45:13,520 --> 01:45:16,876
We should talk to this Jewish guy,
Seidelbaum, okay?

1326
01:45:17,200 --> 01:45:20,988
He's got his own exchange.
He charges 4% at the most.

1327
01:45:21,680 --> 01:45:23,159
And he's connected.

1328
01:45:24,320 --> 01:45:28,154
Fuck them. Mob guys. Guineas.

1329
01:45:29,600 --> 01:45:31,079
I don't trust them.

1330
01:45:49,600 --> 01:45:52,319
Did you sweep the house this month?
The cars?

1331
01:45:52,760 --> 01:45:56,230
Yeah, I told you about it.
The $5,000?

1332
01:45:57,360 --> 01:45:59,794
- Look at that.
- What?

1333
01:46:00,640 --> 01:46:02,198
That cable truck there.

1334
01:46:02,280 --> 01:46:05,078
<i>Since when does it take three days</i>
<i>to rig a cable?</i>

1335
01:46:07,280 --> 01:46:09,748
What? You been watching it
for three days?

1336
01:46:11,640 --> 01:46:13,790
The thing has been there
for three days.

1337
01:46:13,880 --> 01:46:15,598
What am I gonna do, not look at it?

1338
01:46:16,160 --> 01:46:18,913
- What, you think it's cops, right?
- I don't know.

1339
01:46:19,120 --> 01:46:22,271
Could be the Diaz brothers,
coming to get me.

1340
01:46:24,040 --> 01:46:27,953
- Maybe. I'll check it out, okay?
- You check it out.

1341
01:46:28,040 --> 01:46:31,396
Then we're gonna blow
that fucking truck back to Colombia!

1342
01:46:31,680 --> 01:46:35,832
Come on. We're not the only dopers
living on the block.

1343
01:46:35,920 --> 01:46:37,194
Okay? Remember that.

1344
01:46:37,280 --> 01:46:40,158
That truck could be anybody
and anything.

1345
01:46:40,240 --> 01:46:41,559
<i>It could be a cable company...</i>

1346
01:46:41,640 --> 01:46:43,870
You know something?
You got some fucking attitude.

1347
01:46:43,960 --> 01:46:46,520
For someone who's in charge
of my security...

1348
01:46:46,920 --> 01:46:49,832
Here are the keys to the front door.

1349
01:46:49,920 --> 01:46:51,717
Go down there. Give them the keys!

1350
01:46:51,800 --> 01:46:53,438
I'm just trying to say something.

1351
01:46:53,520 --> 01:46:56,432
You're spending a lot of money
on this counter-surveillance.

1352
01:46:56,520 --> 01:46:57,589
I don't give a fuck.

1353
01:46:57,680 --> 01:47:00,194
It's 12% of our adjusted gross.

1354
01:47:00,280 --> 01:47:01,429
12% isn't peanuts.

1355
01:47:01,520 --> 01:47:02,635
I don't give a fuck!

1356
01:47:02,720 --> 01:47:05,075
It makes me sleep good at night.
That's what counts.

1357
01:47:05,160 --> 01:47:07,435
- Okay? You worry about it.
- I am worried about it.

1358
01:47:07,520 --> 01:47:10,159
I'm telling you.
We're getting sloppy.

1359
01:47:10,640 --> 01:47:14,076
Our thinking, our fucking attitude,
you know?

1360
01:47:14,280 --> 01:47:15,998
We're not fucking hungry anymore.

1361
01:47:16,320 --> 01:47:18,595
<i>Miami's changing.</i>
<i>You can see it everywhere.</i>

1362
01:47:18,680 --> 01:47:20,511
<i>New construction. New jobs.</i>

1363
01:47:20,720 --> 01:47:23,439
<i>Growth that's financed</i>
<i>by Florida Security Trust.</i>

1364
01:47:23,520 --> 01:47:26,034
<i>We've put your money to work</i>
<i>for 75 years...</i>

1365
01:47:26,120 --> 01:47:28,076
<i>building a more prosperous Miami.</i>

1366
01:47:28,480 --> 01:47:30,436
<i>Count on us being here tomorrow.</i>

1367
01:47:30,520 --> 01:47:33,557
That's because for 75 years
you been fucking everybody.

1368
01:47:33,840 --> 01:47:37,355
Somebody should do something
about those whores.

1369
01:47:37,680 --> 01:47:40,148
I mean, charging me 10 points
on my money.

1370
01:47:40,240 --> 01:47:43,869
They're getting away with it.
Fuck, there's no laws anymore.

1371
01:47:43,960 --> 01:47:45,359
- Forget it.
- Anything goes.

1372
01:47:45,440 --> 01:47:49,353
They been around 1,000 years.
They got all the angles figured out.

1373
01:47:49,840 --> 01:47:52,718
You know what capitalism is?
Getting fucked.

1374
01:47:52,840 --> 01:47:54,876
True capitalist if ever I met one.

1375
01:47:56,680 --> 01:47:58,352
Did you hear that?

1376
01:47:59,600 --> 01:48:01,511
How would you know, bubblehead?

1377
01:48:02,200 --> 01:48:04,668
You ever do nothing
besides get your hair fixed...

1378
01:48:04,760 --> 01:48:05,954
and powder your nose?

1379
01:48:06,120 --> 01:48:08,554
Look at you.
You do too much of that shit.

1380
01:48:08,640 --> 01:48:10,676
Nothing exceeds like excess.

1381
01:48:11,120 --> 01:48:14,510
- You should know that, Tony.
- I should know what?

1382
01:48:15,720 --> 01:48:17,153
What should I know?

1383
01:48:17,280 --> 01:48:19,794
Why do you have to talk to me
like that all the time?

1384
01:48:19,880 --> 01:48:22,678
- Like I got to know something.
- Let me talk to you.

1385
01:48:22,960 --> 01:48:24,439
Listen.
What time is it?

1386
01:48:24,520 --> 01:48:25,748
This Seidelbaum.

1387
01:48:25,920 --> 01:48:27,114
6:55.

1388
01:48:27,280 --> 01:48:29,555
Okay.
I met with this Seidelbaum...

1389
01:48:29,640 --> 01:48:32,950
<i>The drug-related violence</i>
<i>that's plagued South Florida...</i>

1390
01:48:33,400 --> 01:48:35,595
He's good for a laugh, this guy.

1391
01:48:35,680 --> 01:48:39,468
<i>With a small law-enforcement</i>
<i>budget, how can you put a dent...</i>

1392
01:48:39,800 --> 01:48:44,191
<i>on an estimated</i>
<i>$100-billion-a-year business?</i>

1393
01:48:44,880 --> 01:48:46,677
<i>It seems at times all you can do...</i>

1394
01:48:46,760 --> 01:48:48,716
<i>is put your finger in the dike</i>
<i>and pray.</i>

1395
01:48:48,800 --> 01:48:50,552
Put your fingers in a dyke?

1396
01:48:50,880 --> 01:48:53,030
<i>The only place</i>
<i>you can get your fingers...</i>

1397
01:48:53,120 --> 01:48:54,439
is in some dyke.

1398
01:48:55,240 --> 01:48:59,836
<i>Not by outlawing the substances,</i>
<i>but by legalizing and taxing them.</i>

1399
01:49:00,160 --> 01:49:05,075
<i>These voices say that will drive out</i>
<i>the organized crime element.</i>

1400
01:49:05,720 --> 01:49:07,790
<i>I am not one of those voices.</i>

1401
01:49:07,880 --> 01:49:09,518
I know that. But you know why?

1402
01:49:09,600 --> 01:49:12,319
'Cause you got your head
up your <i>culo</i>, that's why.

1403
01:49:12,400 --> 01:49:14,630
That fucking guy,
he never tells the truth.

1404
01:49:14,720 --> 01:49:17,678
<i>... splendor of our city</i>
<i>at its best.</i>

1405
01:49:17,960 --> 01:49:19,552
It's those guys, man!

1406
01:49:19,640 --> 01:49:21,710
It's the fucking bankers,
the politicians...

1407
01:49:21,800 --> 01:49:23,950
they're the ones
that wanna make coke illegal!

1408
01:49:24,040 --> 01:49:27,316
<i>So they can make the fucking money,</i>
<i>and then get the fucking votes!</i>

1409
01:49:27,400 --> 01:49:30,472
They fighting the bad guys.
They're the bad guys!

1410
01:49:30,760 --> 01:49:32,557
They fuck anything and anyone.

1411
01:49:32,640 --> 01:49:35,598
Can't you stop saying "fuck"
all the time?

1412
01:49:35,760 --> 01:49:38,320
Can't you stop talking about money?
It's boring, Tony.

1413
01:49:38,400 --> 01:49:42,279
Where's this coming from?
Boring? What's boring?

1414
01:49:42,400 --> 01:49:43,913
You're boring.

1415
01:49:44,360 --> 01:49:47,477
"Money."
That's all I hear in this house.

1416
01:49:47,720 --> 01:49:50,598
Look at these pelicans fly.
Come on, pelicans!

1417
01:49:50,680 --> 01:49:53,240
- Here it is.
- Frank never talked about money.

1418
01:49:57,440 --> 01:49:59,795
That's 'cause he was so smart.

1419
01:50:06,760 --> 01:50:08,352
You know what you're becoming?

1420
01:50:08,440 --> 01:50:11,716
You're an immigrant spic millionaire
who can't stop talking...

1421
01:50:11,800 --> 01:50:15,031
Who the fuck you calling a "spic,"
you white piece of bread?

1422
01:50:15,120 --> 01:50:16,553
<i>Get out of the way of the TV!</i>

1423
01:50:16,640 --> 01:50:19,279
Dig a hole in the yard,
bury it, and forget about it.

1424
01:50:19,520 --> 01:50:22,637
I work hard for this!
I want you to know that.

1425
01:50:26,400 --> 01:50:30,154
Somebody should've given it to you.
You would've been a nicer person.

1426
01:50:32,200 --> 01:50:34,156
Know what your problem is, pussycat?

1427
01:50:34,240 --> 01:50:35,753
What is my problem?

1428
01:50:36,480 --> 01:50:38,869
You got nothing to do
with your life.

1429
01:50:39,960 --> 01:50:42,599
Why don't you get a job
or something?

1430
01:50:43,080 --> 01:50:44,911
Do something. Be a nurse.

1431
01:50:45,720 --> 01:50:48,473
Work with blind kids, lepers.
That kind of thing.

1432
01:50:49,840 --> 01:50:53,435
Anything beats lying around all day
waiting for me to fuck you!

1433
01:50:54,040 --> 01:50:56,429
Don't toot your horn, honey.
You're not that good.

1434
01:50:56,520 --> 01:50:58,556
No? Frank was better?

1435
01:50:59,800 --> 01:51:01,233
You're an asshole!

1436
01:51:02,080 --> 01:51:03,957
Where you going? Come here!

1437
01:51:04,600 --> 01:51:06,750
Elvie!

1438
01:51:07,440 --> 01:51:08,714
I was kidding!

1439
01:51:09,640 --> 01:51:11,232
I was only kidding!

1440
01:51:11,720 --> 01:51:15,759
I guess sometimes married life
is not all it's cracked up to be.

1441
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:18,434
- Where you going?
- I got a date.

1442
01:51:19,280 --> 01:51:20,838
You got a date? Come here.

1443
01:51:25,760 --> 01:51:28,433
- What?
- This Seidelbaum thing.

1444
01:51:29,520 --> 01:51:31,033
Yeah, it's all set up.

1445
01:51:31,480 --> 01:51:33,311
Yeah, well, you forget it.

1446
01:51:33,400 --> 01:51:35,311
<i>Stay out of it.</i>
<i>I'll take care of it.</i>

1447
01:51:35,400 --> 01:51:38,039
Stay out of it? It's my deal.
I set it up.

1448
01:51:38,320 --> 01:51:40,595
You're not a negotiator,
Manny, you know that.

1449
01:51:40,680 --> 01:51:42,989
<i>You like the ladies</i>
<i>more than the money.</i>

1450
01:51:43,080 --> 01:51:44,069
That's your problem.

1451
01:51:44,160 --> 01:51:46,958
What the fuck are you talking about?
I'm your partner, okay?

1452
01:51:47,040 --> 01:51:49,349
If you don't trust me
with that kind of thing...

1453
01:51:49,440 --> 01:51:50,919
who're you gonna trust?

1454
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:52,194
Junior partner.

1455
01:51:53,600 --> 01:51:54,635
Bullshit, man.

1456
01:51:54,720 --> 01:51:56,995
Don't talk to me about trust,
I don't like it.

1457
01:51:57,680 --> 01:52:00,035
You should listen to your wife.
She's right.

1458
01:52:00,120 --> 01:52:01,758
You are an asshole, man!

1459
01:52:02,680 --> 01:52:04,910
Come here. Give me a kiss.
Come here.

1460
01:52:06,080 --> 01:52:07,479
Fuck you, man!

1461
01:52:08,520 --> 01:52:11,876
Who put this thing together?
Me! That's who!

1462
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:15,116
Who do I trust? Me!

1463
01:52:15,720 --> 01:52:17,597
Fuck him. "Trust."

1464
01:52:20,360 --> 01:52:23,352
Asshole. Fuck called me an asshole.

1465
01:52:24,200 --> 01:52:25,553
I need that shit.

1466
01:52:27,120 --> 01:52:28,599
I don't need him.

1467
01:52:29,560 --> 01:52:33,235
I don't need her. Fuck them.
I don't need nobody.

1468
01:52:34,280 --> 01:52:36,748
Back then I worked in pictures
down in Colombia.

1469
01:52:36,840 --> 01:52:39,513
<i>I was in that movie</i> Burn.
<i>You ever see it?</i>

1470
01:52:39,880 --> 01:52:43,190
You saw me with Marlon Brando?
You know, we're good friends.

1471
01:52:43,280 --> 01:52:45,589
- I was his driver.
- No shit?

1472
01:52:45,680 --> 01:52:49,229
- Brando.
- They shot it there. Cartagena.

1473
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:51,797
Gillo Pontecorvo.
He was the director.

1474
01:52:51,880 --> 01:52:52,949
Italian guy.

1475
01:52:53,040 --> 01:52:56,589
- Tell me about him.
- I also know Paul Newman.

1476
01:52:57,000 --> 01:52:59,036
- I worked with him in Tucson.
- No kidding?

1477
01:52:59,120 --> 01:53:01,031
Do you know Benny Alvarez?

1478
01:53:01,160 --> 01:53:03,515
In Tucson. Benny Alvarez?

1479
01:53:03,880 --> 01:53:06,474
- Subtotal.
- No?

1480
01:53:09,080 --> 01:53:10,433
He's a nice guy.

1481
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:14,834
$283,107.65.

1482
01:53:17,520 --> 01:53:19,431
You want a company cheque here?

1483
01:53:20,840 --> 01:53:24,628
I got $284,600.

1484
01:53:24,760 --> 01:53:28,036
That's just not possible.
The machine don't make mistakes.

1485
01:53:31,480 --> 01:53:33,550
- Let's count it again.
- No. Come on.

1486
01:53:33,640 --> 01:53:36,871
Business is business. Come on.
You're talking $1,500 here.

1487
01:53:37,920 --> 01:53:40,912
Okay, you keep the change.
Okay? I don't give a shit.

1488
01:53:42,600 --> 01:53:44,795
- I'll count it again for you.
- No, come on.

1489
01:53:44,880 --> 01:53:47,553
This cheque here,
where does this check go?

1490
01:53:50,840 --> 01:53:53,229
- Montana Realty Company.
- Montana what?

1491
01:53:53,640 --> 01:53:55,232
Montana Realty Company.

1492
01:53:55,360 --> 01:53:58,909
Montana Realty Company.

1493
01:53:59,160 --> 01:54:02,630
That's $284,000.
$284,600.

1494
01:54:03,560 --> 01:54:05,994
How come you don't know
Benny Alvarez?

1495
01:54:06,080 --> 01:54:10,358
Me and Benny have lunch together.
He probably knows me.

1496
01:54:10,880 --> 01:54:12,359
<i>You ask him.</i>

1497
01:54:29,640 --> 01:54:31,153
We're up to what?

1498
01:54:32,640 --> 01:54:38,476
Seven cheques. $1,325,623.

1499
01:54:41,160 --> 01:54:43,151
$200,000 more.

1500
01:54:43,240 --> 01:54:45,356
- We ought to take a leak.
- Freeze!

1501
01:54:45,440 --> 01:54:46,714
Get your hands up!

1502
01:54:46,800 --> 01:54:48,313
Go against the wall, turn around.

1503
01:54:48,400 --> 01:54:49,389
You're not kidding.

1504
01:54:49,480 --> 01:54:52,552
You're under arrest
for violation of the RICO Statute.

1505
01:54:52,640 --> 01:54:54,232
"You have the right
to remain silent.

1506
01:54:54,320 --> 01:54:56,788
"Anything you say
can and will be taken against you."

1507
01:54:56,880 --> 01:55:00,190
How do I know you guys are cops?
What's that say, asshole?

1508
01:55:01,600 --> 01:55:04,478
That's pretty good, man.
Where'd you get that?

1509
01:55:04,600 --> 01:55:07,797
You call yourself a Cuban?
You make a real Cuban throw up!

1510
01:55:07,880 --> 01:55:09,950
Call your dog off me, Seidelbaum.

1511
01:55:10,320 --> 01:55:13,357
I want to call my lawyer.
Lot of good he'll do.

1512
01:55:13,520 --> 01:55:15,670
You see that eye there in the clock?

1513
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:17,877
<i>Say, "Hi, honey."</i>

1514
01:55:18,520 --> 01:55:20,829
<i>That's pretty cute. Look at that.</i>

1515
01:55:20,920 --> 01:55:23,036
<i>You jerk off in front of us,</i>
<i>Seidelbaum?</i>

1516
01:55:23,120 --> 01:55:25,350
<i>I was supposed to meet this</i>
<i>chick at 3:00.</i>

1517
01:55:25,440 --> 01:55:27,192
<i>You're a fucking pain in the ass.</i>

1518
01:55:27,520 --> 01:55:29,238
<i>All right, Benny, kill it.</i>

1519
01:55:30,160 --> 01:55:32,628
You understand the rights
I've given you?

1520
01:55:32,800 --> 01:55:34,870
I know all that bullshit,
Seidelbaum!

1521
01:55:34,960 --> 01:55:36,279
Save your breath.

1522
01:55:36,560 --> 01:55:39,199
You got nothing on me.
You know it. I know it.

1523
01:55:39,680 --> 01:55:41,910
I'm changing dollar bills,
that's all.

1524
01:55:42,280 --> 01:55:45,511
You want to waste my time?
Okay. I call my lawyer.

1525
01:55:46,200 --> 01:55:49,909
He's the best lawyer in Miami.
He's such a good lawyer...

1526
01:55:50,440 --> 01:55:54,115
that by tomorrow morning,
you gonna be working in Alaska.

1527
01:55:55,760 --> 01:55:57,034
So dress warm.

1528
01:56:01,120 --> 01:56:04,874
Give me a cheque
for $100,000, plus $300,000 in cash.

1529
01:56:05,480 --> 01:56:08,074
I guarantee you walk
on the conspiracy charge.

1530
01:56:08,920 --> 01:56:11,798
They're gonna come back at us
on a tax evasion...

1531
01:56:12,840 --> 01:56:14,558
and they'll get it.

1532
01:56:18,320 --> 01:56:20,550
So, what am I looking at here?

1533
01:56:22,760 --> 01:56:24,876
Five years. You'll be out in three.

1534
01:56:24,960 --> 01:56:27,520
<i>Maybe less, if I can make a deal.</i>

1535
01:56:29,080 --> 01:56:30,559
Three fucking years!

1536
01:56:32,840 --> 01:56:34,068
For what?

1537
01:56:35,080 --> 01:56:38,436
Washing money? The fucking country
was built on washed money.

1538
01:56:38,520 --> 01:56:39,839
Can't be that bad.

1539
01:56:39,920 --> 01:56:42,275
- It's not like Cuba.
- What the fuck you talking?

1540
01:56:42,360 --> 01:56:45,432
- The jails are like hotels.
- You kidding me or what?

1541
01:56:45,520 --> 01:56:48,239
You fucking high?
I'll delay the trial.

1542
01:56:48,480 --> 01:56:51,438
A year and a half, two years.
You won't even start...

1543
01:56:51,520 --> 01:56:52,635
Fuck you, man!

1544
01:56:52,720 --> 01:56:54,631
I'm not going back
in any cage, okay?

1545
01:56:54,720 --> 01:56:56,472
<i>No way. I been there.</i>

1546
01:57:01,880 --> 01:57:03,199
Okay, look.

1547
01:57:05,400 --> 01:57:09,473
I give you $400,000 more.
Okay, now that's $800,000.

1548
01:57:09,920 --> 01:57:12,957
With that kind of money,
you can buy the Supreme Court.

1549
01:57:15,480 --> 01:57:18,790
Tony, the law has to prove
beyond a reasonable doubt.

1550
01:57:19,720 --> 01:57:23,713
I'm an expert at raising that doubt.
But when you got $1,300,000...

1551
01:57:23,840 --> 01:57:26,912
undeclared
staring into a videotape camera...

1552
01:57:27,560 --> 01:57:31,394
honey baby, it's hard to convince
a jury you found it in a taxicab.

1553
01:57:54,040 --> 01:57:56,474
I'm so glad you could come
on such short notice.

1554
01:57:56,560 --> 01:57:57,629
I really appreciate it.

1555
01:57:57,720 --> 01:57:59,358
- It's okay.
- How's Elvira?

1556
01:57:59,640 --> 01:58:02,598
- Great. How's your wife?
- Three more months.

1557
01:58:02,760 --> 01:58:05,069
- Yeah? Congratulations.
- How about you?

1558
01:58:05,160 --> 01:58:07,754
When you gonna have another Tony
to take your place?

1559
01:58:07,840 --> 01:58:10,718
- I'm working on it.
- You have to work harder. Come.

1560
01:58:10,880 --> 01:58:13,155
<i>I want you to meet</i>
<i>some of my friends.</i>

1561
01:58:17,880 --> 01:58:19,108
This is Pedro Quinn...

1562
01:58:19,200 --> 01:58:21,111
chairman of
the Andes Sugar Corporation.

1563
01:58:21,200 --> 01:58:23,589
- Pleasure meeting you.
- Nice to meet you.

1564
01:58:23,680 --> 01:58:26,911
General Edward Strasser,
Commander of the First Army Corps.

1565
01:58:28,360 --> 01:58:29,509
Pleasure.

1566
01:58:29,600 --> 01:58:31,556
This is Ariel Bleyer...

1567
01:58:31,680 --> 01:58:34,513
with the Ministry of the Interior.
Tony Montana.

1568
01:58:36,600 --> 01:58:40,354
And here is our friend
Charles Goodson from Washington.

1569
01:58:40,640 --> 01:58:43,154
- Nice to meet you.
- How do you do, Mr. Montana?

1570
01:58:44,160 --> 01:58:45,593
Sit here, Tony.

1571
01:58:49,200 --> 01:58:50,428
<i>Gentlemen.</i>

1572
01:58:54,200 --> 01:58:56,031
I would like to discuss something...

1573
01:58:56,120 --> 01:58:58,031
that is of interest
to all of us here.

1574
01:58:59,280 --> 01:59:00,952
You have a problem, Tony.

1575
01:59:01,760 --> 01:59:04,832
We have a problem.

1576
01:59:05,960 --> 01:59:08,599
I think together
we can solve all our problems.

1577
01:59:10,760 --> 01:59:13,194
<i>We all know you have tax troubles</i>
<i>in your country...</i>

1578
01:59:13,280 --> 01:59:15,874
<i>and that you may have to do</i>
<i>a little time.</i>

1579
01:59:16,480 --> 01:59:17,993
<i>We have friends in Washington...</i>

1580
01:59:18,080 --> 01:59:21,038
that assure us these troubles
can be taken care of.

1581
01:59:21,120 --> 01:59:24,510
You may have to pay some back taxes,
a big fine...

1582
01:59:25,280 --> 01:59:27,271
but there will be no prison.

1583
01:59:27,920 --> 01:59:28,909
Okay.

1584
01:59:29,800 --> 01:59:31,677
So what's your problem, Alex?

1585
01:59:32,680 --> 01:59:34,398
I'll show you my problem.

1586
01:59:34,920 --> 01:59:36,592
<i>I've heard about financial...</i>

1587
01:59:36,680 --> 01:59:37,954
<i>support the government receives...</i>

1588
01:59:38,040 --> 01:59:39,792
<i>from the drug industry in Bolivia.</i>

1589
01:59:39,880 --> 01:59:43,031
<i>Well, the irony of this</i>
<i>is that this money...</i>

1590
01:59:43,120 --> 01:59:44,599
<i>which is in the billions...</i>

1591
01:59:44,800 --> 01:59:46,472
<i>is coming from your country.</i>

1592
01:59:46,560 --> 01:59:50,235
<i>You are the major purchaser</i>
<i>of our national product...</i>

1593
01:59:50,320 --> 01:59:52,038
<i>which is cocaine.</i>

1594
01:59:52,120 --> 01:59:54,270
<i>You're saying</i>
<i>the U.S. Government...</i>

1595
01:59:54,360 --> 01:59:58,478
<i>is spending millions to eliminate</i>
<i>the flow of drugs onto our streets.</i>

1596
01:59:58,760 --> 02:00:00,318
<i>At the same time...</i>

1597
02:00:00,400 --> 02:00:03,153
<i>we are doing business</i>
<i>with the same government...</i>

1598
02:00:03,360 --> 02:00:05,794
<i>that is flooding our streets</i>
<i>with cocaine.</i>

1599
02:00:06,120 --> 02:00:08,588
<i>Let me show you</i>
<i>a few of the other characters...</i>

1600
02:00:08,680 --> 02:00:10,830
<i>that are involved</i>
<i>in this tragic comedy.</i>

1601
02:00:10,920 --> 02:00:15,994
<i>My organization just recently traced</i>
<i>a large purchase by this man.</i>

1602
02:00:16,640 --> 02:00:20,076
<i>This charming face here</i>
<i>belongs to General Cucombre.</i>

1603
02:00:20,360 --> 02:00:23,477
<i>He is the Minister of the Defense</i>
<i>of Bolivia, my country.</i>

1604
02:00:23,960 --> 02:00:26,269
<i>And General Cucombre just</i>
<i>a couple months ago...</i>

1605
02:00:26,360 --> 02:00:30,558
<i>bought a $12 million villa</i>
<i>on Lake Lucerne in Switzerland.</i>

1606
02:00:30,640 --> 02:00:33,837
<i>Now, if Cucombre is supposed to be</i>
<i>the Bolivian Defense Minister...</i>

1607
02:00:33,920 --> 02:00:36,070
<i>what is he doing</i>
<i>living in Switzerland?</i>

1608
02:00:36,160 --> 02:00:37,593
<i>Guarding cash registers?</i>

1609
02:00:38,640 --> 02:00:42,792
<i>This man here, Alejandro Sosa,</i>
<i>a very interesting character.</i>

1610
02:00:43,040 --> 02:00:44,632
<i>He's a wealthy landowner...</i>

1611
02:00:44,720 --> 02:00:47,188
<i>educated in England,</i>
<i>very good family.</i>

1612
02:00:47,480 --> 02:00:51,314
<i>But this man is the business brain</i>
<i>and drug overlord...</i>

1613
02:00:51,560 --> 02:00:54,199
<i>of an empire that stretches</i>
<i>across the Andes.</i>

1614
02:00:54,280 --> 02:00:56,714
<i>He's not your ordinary drug dealer.</i>

1615
02:00:57,280 --> 02:00:59,794
<i>Well, discussing it openly...</i>

1616
02:01:00,880 --> 02:01:03,235
He's scheduled for <i>60 Minutes</i> next.

1617
02:01:03,800 --> 02:01:09,113
He is going on French, British,
Italian, Japanese television.

1618
02:01:09,680 --> 02:01:12,478
People everywhere
are starting to listen to him.

1619
02:01:12,920 --> 02:01:14,558
It's embarrassing, Tony.

1620
02:01:16,680 --> 02:01:18,875
That is our problem.

1621
02:01:21,400 --> 02:01:23,550
You remember Alberto, don't you?

1622
02:01:24,840 --> 02:01:26,478
How could I forget him?

1623
02:01:27,160 --> 02:01:30,391
Alberto is an expert
in the disposal business.

1624
02:01:31,360 --> 02:01:33,635
He's going to help us
fix our problem.

1625
02:01:35,360 --> 02:01:37,237
But he doesn't speak English.

1626
02:01:37,960 --> 02:01:40,838
He doesn't know his way
around the States too well.

1627
02:01:41,080 --> 02:01:42,957
He needs a little help.

1628
02:01:45,080 --> 02:01:46,911
Is that a problem, Tony?

1629
02:01:52,600 --> 02:01:54,158
No problem.

1630
02:01:56,600 --> 02:01:57,669
Good.

1631
02:02:12,280 --> 02:02:16,114
So what's the big mystery
with the Bolivian situation?

1632
02:02:16,480 --> 02:02:19,358
You gonna tell me what happened
with Sosa, or what?

1633
02:02:19,600 --> 02:02:22,717
A lot of bullshit,
that's what happened.

1634
02:02:23,600 --> 02:02:24,715
Politics.

1635
02:02:29,280 --> 02:02:32,431
I want you to stay down here
for a while.

1636
02:02:33,600 --> 02:02:35,238
Run things for me.

1637
02:02:35,960 --> 02:02:38,030
I gotta go to New York next week.

1638
02:02:44,120 --> 02:02:45,348
Fuck this, man.

1639
02:02:45,440 --> 02:02:48,238
I don't like it, man.
I don't like this at all.

1640
02:02:48,320 --> 02:02:49,912
You don't like it?

1641
02:02:52,840 --> 02:02:55,991
You got me into this mess
in the first place.

1642
02:02:56,080 --> 02:02:59,629
With that fucking Seidelbaum,
that right?

1643
02:02:59,720 --> 02:03:01,039
With Seidelbaum?

1644
02:03:01,120 --> 02:03:03,236
What does Seidelbaum
have to do with Sosa?

1645
02:03:03,320 --> 02:03:05,959
How do you connect those two?

1646
02:03:06,360 --> 02:03:08,874
Why don't you eat your food?
What's wrong with it?

1647
02:03:08,960 --> 02:03:10,916
I'm not hungry.

1648
02:03:11,560 --> 02:03:14,438
You're not hungry?
Do you know about the trial?

1649
02:03:14,600 --> 02:03:18,559
- What did you order it for, then?
- I lost my appetite.

1650
02:03:23,520 --> 02:03:27,149
Do you even know that Sheffield said
he can get you a postponement?

1651
02:03:34,240 --> 02:03:38,233
Is this it?
That's what it's all about?

1652
02:03:41,320 --> 02:03:44,596
Eating, drinking...

1653
02:03:45,080 --> 02:03:47,150
fucking, sucking...

1654
02:03:47,240 --> 02:03:49,879
- Come on, man.
- Snorting?

1655
02:03:49,960 --> 02:03:51,075
Then what?

1656
02:03:52,680 --> 02:03:54,432
Tell me. Then what?

1657
02:03:55,360 --> 02:03:59,672
You're 50.
You got a bag for a belly.

1658
02:04:01,040 --> 02:04:03,679
You got tits, you need a bra.

1659
02:04:04,480 --> 02:04:05,993
They got hair on them.

1660
02:04:07,160 --> 02:04:10,391
You got a liver,
and they got spots on it...

1661
02:04:10,480 --> 02:04:12,436
and you're eating
this fucking shit...

1662
02:04:12,920 --> 02:04:16,310
and you're looking like
these rich fucking mummies in here.

1663
02:04:16,520 --> 02:04:19,114
Come on. It's not so bad.
It could be worse.

1664
02:04:19,760 --> 02:04:22,149
- Is this what it's all about?
- Forget it.

1665
02:04:22,320 --> 02:04:25,198
This what I work for? Tell me.

1666
02:04:30,520 --> 02:04:31,714
Look at that.

1667
02:04:32,760 --> 02:04:34,034
A junkie.

1668
02:04:35,760 --> 02:04:39,958
I got a fucking junkie for a wife.
She don't eat nothing.

1669
02:04:41,080 --> 02:04:44,675
Sleeps all day
with them black shades on.

1670
02:04:46,280 --> 02:04:48,874
- Wakes up with a Quaalude...
- Don't pick on her, man.

1671
02:04:48,960 --> 02:04:52,509
...and who won't fuck me
'cause she's in a coma.

1672
02:04:54,120 --> 02:04:56,475
I can't even have a kid with her.

1673
02:04:56,560 --> 02:04:59,154
Her womb is so polluted...

1674
02:04:59,240 --> 02:05:02,118
I can't even have
a fucking little baby with her!

1675
02:05:02,200 --> 02:05:04,430
You son of a bitch!

1676
02:05:05,320 --> 02:05:06,912
You fuck!

1677
02:05:07,280 --> 02:05:10,829
- You shouldn't talk like that.
- How dare you talk to me like that!

1678
02:05:12,080 --> 02:05:14,355
What makes you
so much better than me?

1679
02:05:14,760 --> 02:05:16,034
- What do you do?
- Don't worry.

1680
02:05:16,120 --> 02:05:19,556
You deal drugs and you kill people.
That's wonderful, Tony.

1681
02:05:20,200 --> 02:05:22,475
Real contribution to human history.

1682
02:05:22,560 --> 02:05:25,279
- Go ahead. Tell everybody.
- You want a kid?

1683
02:05:25,360 --> 02:05:26,634
Tell the world.

1684
02:05:26,720 --> 02:05:29,473
What kind of a father
would you make?

1685
02:05:30,800 --> 02:05:33,155
Gonna drive him to school
in the mornings?

1686
02:05:33,240 --> 02:05:36,676
Are you even gonna be alive
by the time the kid goes to school?

1687
02:05:38,120 --> 02:05:40,998
- You don't know how to be a husband!
- Sit down before I...

1688
02:05:41,080 --> 02:05:43,469
Do we ever go anywhere
without having 600 thugs...

1689
02:05:43,560 --> 02:05:45,152
hanging around all the time?

1690
02:05:45,560 --> 02:05:49,109
I have Nick "The Pig" as a friend.

1691
02:05:50,560 --> 02:05:53,438
What kind of life is that?

1692
02:05:57,720 --> 02:05:59,119
Can't you see...

1693
02:06:01,360 --> 02:06:03,954
what we're becoming, Tony?
We're losers.

1694
02:06:04,880 --> 02:06:07,030
<i>We're not winners, we're losers.</i>

1695
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:11,913
- Go home. You're stoned.
- I'm not stoned, you're stoned.

1696
02:06:12,160 --> 02:06:14,469
- Get her out of here.
- Come on.

1697
02:06:16,760 --> 02:06:18,557
I'm not going home with you.

1698
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:21,991
I'm not going home with anybody.

1699
02:06:23,760 --> 02:06:25,239
I'm going home alone.

1700
02:06:30,680 --> 02:06:31,954
I'm leaving you.

1701
02:06:34,360 --> 02:06:36,271
I don't need this shit anymore.

1702
02:06:36,760 --> 02:06:39,718
Okay, but I'll walk you out.
I'll take her home in a cab.

1703
02:06:39,800 --> 02:06:41,916
Let her go.

1704
02:06:42,520 --> 02:06:45,239
Another Quaalude,
she gonna love me again.

1705
02:06:52,520 --> 02:06:54,033
What're you looking at?

1706
02:07:00,720 --> 02:07:02,995
You're all a bunch
of fucking assholes.

1707
02:07:04,280 --> 02:07:05,713
You know why?

1708
02:07:07,520 --> 02:07:10,637
You don't have the guts
to be what you want to be.

1709
02:07:14,040 --> 02:07:16,270
You need people like me.

1710
02:07:21,720 --> 02:07:23,199
You need people like me...

1711
02:07:23,280 --> 02:07:25,874
so you can point
your fucking fingers...

1712
02:07:26,400 --> 02:07:28,630
and say, "That's the bad guy."

1713
02:07:31,480 --> 02:07:32,595
So...

1714
02:07:33,520 --> 02:07:35,078
what does that make you?

1715
02:07:35,680 --> 02:07:36,669
Good?

1716
02:07:39,440 --> 02:07:41,112
You're not good.

1717
02:07:43,240 --> 02:07:45,071
You just know how to hide...

1718
02:07:46,720 --> 02:07:47,948
how to lie.

1719
02:07:50,520 --> 02:07:53,796
Me, I don't have that problem.

1720
02:07:55,440 --> 02:07:58,512
Me, I always tell the truth.

1721
02:08:00,160 --> 02:08:01,798
Even when I lie.

1722
02:08:10,600 --> 02:08:13,034
So say good night to the bad guy!

1723
02:08:13,640 --> 02:08:14,834
Come on.

1724
02:08:16,960 --> 02:08:19,713
The last time you gonna see
a bad guy like this again...

1725
02:08:19,800 --> 02:08:21,119
let me tell you.

1726
02:08:22,280 --> 02:08:25,511
Come on. Make way for the bad guy.

1727
02:08:26,920 --> 02:08:29,309
<i>There's a bad guy coming through!</i>

1728
02:08:30,040 --> 02:08:31,632
<i>Better get out of his way!</i>

1729
02:08:34,760 --> 02:08:38,753
NEW YORK CITY

1730
02:09:55,560 --> 02:09:59,109
No. You tell Sheffield to keep
his nose out of it.

1731
02:09:59,320 --> 02:10:02,517
<i>There's gonna be no trial.</i>
<i>I got it all under control now.</i>

1732
02:10:02,920 --> 02:10:04,911
<i>Just tell him to stay out of it!</i>

1733
02:10:05,440 --> 02:10:07,749
<i>Okay, what about Elvira?</i>
<i>Did she call?</i>

1734
02:10:11,000 --> 02:10:12,353
Yeah, all right.

1735
02:10:27,160 --> 02:10:28,832
Tony, everything go okay?

1736
02:10:29,160 --> 02:10:30,878
Yeah, everything is roses.

1737
02:10:34,600 --> 02:10:36,158
Ernie, what time do you got?

1738
02:10:36,520 --> 02:10:38,988
- Ten to.
- Ten to.

1739
02:10:39,280 --> 02:10:41,191
- Where is this guy?
- I gotta call Manny.

1740
02:10:42,360 --> 02:10:43,349
Sit down.

1741
02:10:43,440 --> 02:10:44,953
You don't tell me what to do here!

1742
02:10:45,040 --> 02:10:47,190
He's coming out.
He's coming.

1743
02:10:48,480 --> 02:10:50,755
- I don't give a fuck.
- It's him, man.

1744
02:10:53,360 --> 02:10:55,954
We do it
in front of the United Nations.

1745
02:10:56,040 --> 02:10:57,871
That's how they want it.

1746
02:10:57,960 --> 02:11:00,076
I don't care where you blow him up.

1747
02:11:00,680 --> 02:11:02,113
<i>Tell me when, okay?</i>

1748
02:11:03,840 --> 02:11:06,559
<i>You just tell me when.</i>
<i>That's all I care about.</i>

1749
02:11:10,360 --> 02:11:13,875
I want you to stay thirty meters
behind the car, okay?

1750
02:11:14,720 --> 02:11:16,278
Thirty meters. No more.

1751
02:11:16,360 --> 02:11:18,396
I heard you the first time.

1752
02:11:18,480 --> 02:11:20,277
One time.
That's all you gotta tell me.

1753
02:11:21,440 --> 02:11:23,431
I told you thirty meters.

1754
02:11:24,400 --> 02:11:26,550
This fucking guy, I'm telling you.

1755
02:11:29,080 --> 02:11:30,752
Look. Here he comes.

1756
02:11:33,560 --> 02:11:35,551
Where's he going?

1757
02:11:35,760 --> 02:11:37,398
<i>What's he doing that way?</i>

1758
02:11:48,320 --> 02:11:49,912
What the fuck he doing?

1759
02:12:03,160 --> 02:12:05,151
What the fuck is that? Come here.

1760
02:12:05,240 --> 02:12:07,231
You said she took the kids
in the other car!

1761
02:12:07,320 --> 02:12:11,029
She did, every fucking day.
I don't know what's going on.

1762
02:12:13,160 --> 02:12:16,516
No fucking way.
No fucking way. That's it!

1763
02:12:17,880 --> 02:12:19,154
Forget it!

1764
02:12:19,760 --> 02:12:23,639
We kill this guy alone.
No wife, no kids.

1765
02:12:24,320 --> 02:12:28,598
No way. If Sosa says we do it now,
we do it now. Let's go.

1766
02:12:29,160 --> 02:12:31,037
This fucking guy.

1767
02:12:59,760 --> 02:13:02,479
Okay, just stay behind him.

1768
02:13:03,760 --> 02:13:06,558
Slowly, slowly.

1769
02:13:06,760 --> 02:13:08,273
Fuck you, you fucking vulture.

1770
02:13:09,440 --> 02:13:10,953
Okay. Easy.

1771
02:13:12,640 --> 02:13:16,519
Two little kids in the car.
This is so fucking bad.

1772
02:13:17,320 --> 02:13:18,833
<i>This is so fucking bad.</i>

1773
02:13:20,040 --> 02:13:22,873
You're losing them. Look!
You're losing them!

1774
02:13:22,960 --> 02:13:24,757
I see them, all right? I see them!

1775
02:13:25,960 --> 02:13:28,155
Ten meters, ten meters!

1776
02:13:28,560 --> 02:13:30,357
Move it. Move it!

1777
02:13:30,440 --> 02:13:32,078
Shut the fuck up, okay?

1778
02:13:44,120 --> 02:13:47,635
You don't have the guts to look them
in the eye when you kill them.

1779
02:13:47,800 --> 02:13:49,199
You gotta hide with that shit...

1780
02:13:49,280 --> 02:13:50,269
Shut your mouth.

1781
02:13:50,360 --> 02:13:51,998
He's getting up. Let's do it.

1782
02:13:52,080 --> 02:13:53,638
Make you feel good?

1783
02:13:54,120 --> 02:13:56,998
Make you feel good to kill a mama
and her kids. Make you feel big.

1784
02:13:58,160 --> 02:13:59,149
Shut your mouth!

1785
02:13:59,240 --> 02:14:00,639
Like you, big man! Fuck you!

1786
02:14:01,280 --> 02:14:02,633
<i>What do you think I am?</i>

1787
02:14:02,720 --> 02:14:04,790
You think I kill two kids
and a woman?

1788
02:14:04,960 --> 02:14:08,236
Fuck that!
I don't need that shit in my life!

1789
02:14:10,480 --> 02:14:12,357
You die, motherfucker!

1790
02:14:17,080 --> 02:14:18,513
What do you think I am?

1791
02:14:18,600 --> 02:14:20,670
You think I'm a fucking worm
like you?

1792
02:14:20,960 --> 02:14:24,350
I told you, man!
I told you, don't fuck with me!

1793
02:14:24,560 --> 02:14:26,755
I told you, no fucking kids!

1794
02:14:26,880 --> 02:14:30,839
No, but you wouldn't listen!
You stupid fuck! Look at you now.

1795
02:14:36,120 --> 02:14:38,315
Nick, where the fuck you been?

1796
02:14:39,560 --> 02:14:40,913
<i>On a delivery?</i>

1797
02:14:41,720 --> 02:14:43,597
Where the hell is Manny?

1798
02:14:43,680 --> 02:14:45,477
I been calling all over.
Where is he?

1799
02:14:45,560 --> 02:14:47,869
I don't know, Tony.

1800
02:14:47,960 --> 02:14:49,712
He's been gone
the last couple of days.

1801
02:14:49,800 --> 02:14:52,155
<i>He didn't say nothing.</i>
He's gone? Where?

1802
02:14:52,240 --> 02:14:55,994
I left him in fucking charge, man!
Where the fuck is he?

1803
02:14:56,120 --> 02:14:58,350
You can't trust nobody anymore!

1804
02:14:58,440 --> 02:15:01,716
I don't know, Tony.
He just took off.

1805
02:15:01,800 --> 02:15:03,950
<i>He didn't say nothing.</i>
He took off?

1806
02:15:04,720 --> 02:15:07,951
<i>Are you all right?</i>
No, I'm not! I'm pissed!

1807
02:15:08,040 --> 02:15:09,155
When I get back there...

1808
02:15:09,240 --> 02:15:11,196
I'll kick some ass
all over the place!

1809
02:15:11,280 --> 02:15:13,999
<i>When you coming back?</i>
I'm coming back tonight!

1810
02:15:14,320 --> 02:15:16,311
This fucking cocksucker.

1811
02:15:16,920 --> 02:15:21,311
Tony, your mama called. Gina's gone.

1812
02:15:22,840 --> 02:15:25,912
Gone? Where?
<i>She got to see you right away.</i>

1813
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:29,549
Tell her I'll call her tonight.

1814
02:15:29,760 --> 02:15:32,797
Listen to me.
What about Elvie? She call?

1815
02:15:32,920 --> 02:15:35,115
<i>No.</i>
No.

1816
02:15:35,200 --> 02:15:36,872
Okay, listen to me.

1817
02:15:36,960 --> 02:15:39,190
If she calls,
just tell her I love her.

1818
02:15:39,280 --> 02:15:41,350
Okay? Just tell her that.

1819
02:16:04,200 --> 02:16:05,952
You hear from Manny?
No.

1820
02:16:06,040 --> 02:16:07,837
Your mama called, she gotta see you.

1821
02:16:07,920 --> 02:16:11,879
Sosa's been ringing every half hour.
He sounds pissed.

1822
02:16:11,960 --> 02:16:14,633
Get him on the phone. Elvie call?
No.

1823
02:16:17,560 --> 02:16:20,393
You keep trying Manny.
I want that cocksucker here.

1824
02:16:20,480 --> 02:16:22,596
- I want him here now! Okay?
- Okay.

1825
02:16:22,680 --> 02:16:25,717
Come on. Go ahead, get him!
Let's go. Come on!

1826
02:16:39,800 --> 02:16:44,032
Yeah? Mama. Yeah, I know.

1827
02:16:44,920 --> 02:16:47,480
They told me.

1828
02:16:47,560 --> 02:16:49,437
Okay. I'm coming over.

1829
02:16:49,520 --> 02:16:52,239
I'll be over to see you.
I'll be over, yeah.

1830
02:16:56,200 --> 02:16:58,077
Put it on the speaker.

1831
02:17:07,720 --> 02:17:09,756
<i>What happened, Tony?</i>

1832
02:17:10,680 --> 02:17:13,478
Alex, how you doing?
<i>What happened?</i>

1833
02:17:13,800 --> 02:17:16,030
We had some problems.

1834
02:17:18,200 --> 02:17:20,509
Alex?
<i>Tony, what happened?</i>

1835
02:17:23,880 --> 02:17:26,030
We had a little problem.
<i>I heard.</i>

1836
02:17:26,120 --> 02:17:27,235
How you hear that?

1837
02:17:27,320 --> 02:17:29,390
Our friend gave a speech at the UN.

1838
02:17:29,480 --> 02:17:32,313
He was not supposed to give
that speech.

1839
02:17:34,520 --> 02:17:37,717
Well, your guy, Alberto,
he's a piece of shit.

1840
02:17:37,800 --> 02:17:39,950
I told him to do something,
he didn't listen...

1841
02:17:40,040 --> 02:17:41,473
so I cancelled his contract.

1842
02:17:41,560 --> 02:17:43,915
My partners and I are pissed off.

1843
02:17:44,440 --> 02:17:46,158
That's okay. No big deal.

1844
02:17:46,360 --> 02:17:49,272
There's other Albertos.
We'll do it next month.

1845
02:17:49,360 --> 02:17:51,351
No, Tony, you can't do that.

1846
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:54,878
They found what was under the car.

1847
02:17:55,720 --> 02:17:58,280
Now our friend has got security
up the ass.

1848
02:17:58,560 --> 02:18:01,950
<i>The heat will come down hard</i>
<i>on my partners and me.</i>

1849
02:18:02,720 --> 02:18:04,597
There's not gonna be a next time...

1850
02:18:04,680 --> 02:18:08,229
<i>- you dumb cocksucker! You blew it!</i>
- Take it easy when you talk to me.

1851
02:18:08,360 --> 02:18:12,990
I told you a long time ago,
you fucking monkey, not to fuck me!

1852
02:18:13,080 --> 02:18:14,957
Who the fuck
you think you're talking to?

1853
02:18:15,040 --> 02:18:16,189
<i>You want to fuck with...</i>

1854
02:18:16,280 --> 02:18:19,556
Who the fuck you think I am,
your fucking bellboy?

1855
02:18:20,480 --> 02:18:23,870
You want to go to war?
We take you to war, okay?

1856
02:18:24,960 --> 02:18:27,269
Alex, you there? Hey!

1857
02:18:27,400 --> 02:18:30,756
He's not there<i>. Cálmate</i>, man.

1858
02:18:32,080 --> 02:18:35,789
She got a place of her own.
She don't tell me where.

1859
02:18:36,040 --> 02:18:38,270
One night, I follow her in a taxi.

1860
02:18:38,360 --> 02:18:40,954
She goes to a fancy house
in Coconut Grove.

1861
02:18:41,960 --> 02:18:43,678
- Where'd she get the money?
- You!

1862
02:18:43,760 --> 02:18:46,638
You were giving her the money!
You see what you do to her?

1863
02:18:46,720 --> 02:18:48,995
- I don't give her that much money.
- You did!

1864
02:18:49,080 --> 02:18:52,072
- One time, $1,000 you gave her.
- Was a guy with her?

1865
02:18:52,760 --> 02:18:54,637
I don't know.

1866
02:18:54,920 --> 02:18:57,036
There was this car in the driveway.

1867
02:18:57,120 --> 02:18:58,792
I know if I go there,
she'll kill me.

1868
02:18:58,880 --> 02:19:01,519
- She's like you.
- Where's the place? Where is it?

1869
02:19:01,720 --> 02:19:04,598
400 something...

1870
02:19:04,680 --> 02:19:05,795
Citrus Drive.

1871
02:19:05,880 --> 02:19:08,155
- 400 what?
- 409, I think.

1872
02:19:08,400 --> 02:19:11,472
You gotta talk to her, Antonio.
She don't listen to me.

1873
02:19:11,560 --> 02:19:13,312
She says to me, <i>"Mira</i>, shut up!

1874
02:19:13,400 --> 02:19:14,594
"Mind your own business."

1875
02:19:14,680 --> 02:19:16,477
Exactly like you do to me.

1876
02:19:16,560 --> 02:19:19,233
Ever since you came back,
she's been getting this way.

1877
02:19:19,360 --> 02:19:21,920
- I gotta go.
- Why do you have to hurt everything?

1878
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:23,956
Why do you have to destroy...

1879
02:19:24,040 --> 02:19:26,235
everything that comes your way?

1880
02:19:30,120 --> 02:19:32,509
409 Citrus Drive.

1881
02:19:32,800 --> 02:19:35,792
- Tony, I can't find Manny anywhere.
- Fuck!

1882
02:19:36,200 --> 02:19:38,873
Okay. Listen, boss, I'll try again.

1883
02:20:10,560 --> 02:20:13,677
You stay here.
Keep trying Manny, okay?

1884
02:22:08,320 --> 02:22:12,711
We got married just yesterday.
We were gonna surprise you.

1885
02:22:18,240 --> 02:22:19,673
Jesus, Tony.

1886
02:22:20,120 --> 02:22:23,430
Tony, we gotta get outta here, man.
We gotta get outta here.

1887
02:22:23,960 --> 02:22:25,552
Go get Gina.

1888
02:22:33,440 --> 02:22:34,509
No!

1889
02:22:40,920 --> 02:22:43,718
No, Gina. Come on, Gina. No!

1890
02:22:43,800 --> 02:22:45,358
God!

1891
02:22:53,360 --> 02:22:55,032
Tony, we can't stay here.
We gotta go.

1892
02:22:55,120 --> 02:22:56,951
We gotta get out of here.

1893
02:23:35,160 --> 02:23:36,513
Come on, Gina.

1894
02:23:39,960 --> 02:23:42,110
Here we go. It's gonna be okay.

1895
02:23:42,240 --> 02:23:44,231
- You got her?
- I got her.

1896
02:24:10,440 --> 02:24:14,149
No! This is Tony's place! Let me go!

1897
02:24:57,320 --> 02:25:00,118
We put some pills into her.
She's gonna be all right, Tony.

1898
02:25:00,200 --> 02:25:01,838
She's cooling down. Right?

1899
02:25:01,920 --> 02:25:04,753
- She's gonna be fine. Just fine.
- Right.

1900
02:25:07,280 --> 02:25:09,032
What are we gonna do now?

1901
02:25:13,320 --> 02:25:14,469
Do?

1902
02:25:19,120 --> 02:25:20,712
We're going to war.

1903
02:25:21,880 --> 02:25:23,950
<i>That's what we're gonna do.</i>

1904
02:25:27,360 --> 02:25:30,318
We're gonna eat that Sosa
for breakfast!

1905
02:25:32,560 --> 02:25:35,074
Close that fucker down.

1906
02:25:40,720 --> 02:25:42,676
Tony, take it easy.

1907
02:25:50,080 --> 02:25:53,277
All right, Ernie. Let's go.
We'll take care of the house.

1908
02:27:01,400 --> 02:27:03,197
Come on.

1909
02:27:03,280 --> 02:27:05,669
This cocksucker's
gonna run all over you.

1910
02:27:21,760 --> 02:27:24,558
Come on.
I'll bury these cocksuckers.

1911
02:27:33,120 --> 02:27:35,680
We gotta get organized here.

1912
02:27:46,400 --> 02:27:49,517
Fuck! Manny.

1913
02:27:56,040 --> 02:27:57,951
How the fuck I do that?

1914
02:28:01,920 --> 02:28:04,229
How the fuck I do that, Manny?

1915
02:28:47,920 --> 02:28:48,909
Manolo.

1916
02:29:40,480 --> 02:29:42,516
Is this what you want, Tony?

1917
02:29:53,240 --> 02:29:56,038
You can't stand for another man
to be touching me.

1918
02:29:58,360 --> 02:30:00,157
So you want me, Tony?

1919
02:30:03,760 --> 02:30:05,193
What are you talking about?

1920
02:30:06,760 --> 02:30:08,159
Is that it?

1921
02:30:11,880 --> 02:30:13,199
Here I am, Tony.

1922
02:30:17,960 --> 02:30:20,076
I am all yours now, Tony, you see?

1923
02:30:22,760 --> 02:30:24,318
I'm all yours now.

1924
02:30:26,920 --> 02:30:29,070
You better come and get me now.

1925
02:30:29,960 --> 02:30:31,791
Come on.
Come and get me.

1926
02:30:31,880 --> 02:30:33,279
Come and get me.

1927
02:30:34,240 --> 02:30:36,913
You do it now before it's too late.

1928
02:30:39,480 --> 02:30:40,629
Come on, Tony.

1929
02:30:42,720 --> 02:30:43,835
Fuck me.

1930
02:30:47,720 --> 02:30:50,029
Fuck me. Come on and just fuck me!

1931
02:31:06,240 --> 02:31:07,229
Die!

1932
02:31:20,800 --> 02:31:23,394
They're all over the place!
Get out of here!

1933
02:31:45,840 --> 02:31:49,833
Come on. Look at your face.
It's all dirty.

1934
02:32:06,680 --> 02:32:08,193
Please talk to me.

1935
02:32:09,960 --> 02:32:11,439
Don't be mad at me.

1936
02:32:11,680 --> 02:32:14,877
Please. Gina, come on.

1937
02:32:16,600 --> 02:32:20,115
I love Manny, you know?

1938
02:32:20,440 --> 02:32:21,634
I love him.

1939
02:32:23,600 --> 02:32:25,989
And I love you, too, you know?

1940
02:32:51,640 --> 02:32:52,868
Give me a smile.

1941
02:32:52,960 --> 02:32:57,078
They're coming from everywhere!
Open up! Open the fucking door!

1942
02:32:58,640 --> 02:33:00,551
<i>Please! Tony!</i>

1943
02:33:00,640 --> 02:33:02,551
<i>Let me in, boss! Please!</i>

1944
02:33:02,760 --> 02:33:04,716
<i>Tony, open the fucking door!</i>

1945
02:33:25,720 --> 02:33:30,635
You wait here, okay?
I'll be with you. I'll be back.

1946
02:33:34,000 --> 02:33:36,230
You wait for me. I'm coming back.

1947
02:33:39,960 --> 02:33:42,269
Okay, Sosa.
You want to fuck with me?

1948
02:33:46,720 --> 02:33:48,631
<i>You're fucking with the best!</i>

1949
02:33:52,840 --> 02:33:54,478
You want to fuck with me?

1950
02:33:56,200 --> 02:33:57,918
You cockroaches.

1951
02:34:01,120 --> 02:34:03,759
You want to play games?
Okay, I play with you.

1952
02:34:08,360 --> 02:34:09,918
<i>You wanna play rough?</i>

1953
02:34:11,360 --> 02:34:13,430
Say hello to my little friend!

1954
02:34:16,640 --> 02:34:18,153
<i>You want to play rough?</i>

1955
02:34:19,280 --> 02:34:21,999
<i>There! You like that?</i>

1956
02:34:23,800 --> 02:34:25,028
You want more?

1957
02:34:31,840 --> 02:34:32,989
<i>You whores!</i>

1958
02:34:34,360 --> 02:34:35,429
Cowards!

1959
02:35:21,120 --> 02:35:22,553
Want to fuck with me?

1960
02:35:38,720 --> 02:35:40,392
<i>Go ahead!</i>

1961
02:35:41,800 --> 02:35:42,789
<i>Come on!</i>

1962
02:35:45,400 --> 02:35:47,470
How do you like that?

1963
02:35:48,240 --> 02:35:50,117
You fucking <i>maricón</i>!

1964
02:35:52,440 --> 02:35:54,078
You think you can take me?

1965
02:35:54,160 --> 02:35:56,310
<i>You need a fucking army</i>
<i>if you gonna take me!</i>

1966
02:35:56,400 --> 02:36:00,552
You hear? Come on!
I take you all to fucking hell!

1967
02:36:06,160 --> 02:36:09,232
Who you think you fucking with?
I'm Tony Montana!

1968
02:36:10,120 --> 02:36:12,588
You fuck with me,
you fucking with the best!

1969
02:36:16,640 --> 02:36:18,153
I'm still standing.

1970
02:36:22,280 --> 02:36:24,669
Come on! I take your fucking bullet!

1971
02:36:26,200 --> 02:36:28,031
Come on! I take your fucking bullet!

1972
02:36:28,120 --> 02:36:29,792
You think you kill me with bullets?

1973
02:36:29,880 --> 02:36:32,440
I take your fucking bullets!
Go ahead!
