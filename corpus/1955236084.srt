1
00:01:06,055 --> 00:01:07,647
Cops!

2
00:01:11,493 --> 00:01:12,926
Cops!

3
00:01:12,995 --> 00:01:16,453
Julie Barnes. Runaway.
An addict at 18. A fighter.

4
00:01:16,532 --> 00:01:19,296
This little girl
was as hard as they come.

5
00:01:32,614 --> 00:01:36,414
Pete Cochran. A lost cause.
The world's biggest screwup.

6
00:01:36,485 --> 00:01:39,113
He went straight from Beverly Hills
to county jail.

7
00:01:57,506 --> 00:02:00,839
Lincoln Hayes. He doesn't blame
his crimes on anything.

8
00:02:00,909 --> 00:02:03,571
Had reasons all his own
to burn the world down.

9
00:02:13,989 --> 00:02:15,388
Easy, man!

10
00:02:15,457 --> 00:02:17,618
Your mother and I have been
worried sick, little girl.

11
00:02:17,693 --> 00:02:20,093
You gonna have to give it up
to Daddy, now. Come on.

12
00:02:20,162 --> 00:02:21,595
Hey! Stop!

13
00:02:23,699 --> 00:02:26,429
Take this police brutality, baby!

14
00:02:26,502 --> 00:02:28,265
Out of my way!

15
00:02:33,208 --> 00:02:36,075
All right, I'm gettin' out of here!
Dude, relax.

16
00:02:36,145 --> 00:02:40,104
Get those skinny leather pants
out of here!

17
00:02:40,182 --> 00:02:45,142
Go! You little shit.
You're gonna get caught.

18
00:02:50,626 --> 00:02:52,924
Easy, baby. Why the hackles?

19
00:03:14,149 --> 00:03:15,844
- How you doin'?
- Okay.

20
00:03:15,918 --> 00:03:18,011
Yeah? Can you hear me?

21
00:03:18,086 --> 00:03:19,678
Okay.

22
00:03:21,957 --> 00:03:25,017
They could've been anybody,
no better or worse than the rest.

23
00:03:25,093 --> 00:03:29,462
Heading for nowhere.
Until I gave them one last chance.

24
00:03:48,183 --> 00:03:50,117
- I'm gonna kill those kids.
- They're mine.

25
00:03:50,185 --> 00:03:53,916
- If anybody does, it's me.
- They're screwing with my men.

26
00:03:53,989 --> 00:03:57,049
- Is there a problem, fellas?
- No.

27
00:03:57,125 --> 00:03:59,855
- Workin' late again tonight, huh?
- Yeah.

28
00:03:59,928 --> 00:04:03,557
Every night, until we find out who stole
those drugs from the evidence locker.

29
00:04:07,369 --> 00:04:10,270
- IA.
- They were just doing their job.

30
00:04:10,339 --> 00:04:12,500
Hello, Los Angeles!

31
00:04:12,574 --> 00:04:15,702
- Adam...
- They didn't volunteer for this job.

32
00:04:15,777 --> 00:04:17,267
- It was my idea.
- They're punks.

33
00:04:17,346 --> 00:04:19,814
- We're supposed to give them a chance.
- Come on!

34
00:04:19,881 --> 00:04:22,645
You're gonna side with them?
They're not real cops!

35
00:04:22,718 --> 00:04:24,948
They can't even carry guns,
for God's sakes.

36
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:28,285
Maybe you should spend a little more
time worrying about your own guys...

37
00:04:28,357 --> 00:04:30,335
- and a little less time...
- What's that supposed to mean?

38
00:04:30,359 --> 00:04:34,090
Nothing. These kids can get into
a thousand places that we can't.

39
00:04:36,531 --> 00:04:41,127
You three really screwed up tonight.
Get your feet off that table. Get up!

40
00:04:41,203 --> 00:04:44,297
What are you talking about, man?
We got the job done.

41
00:04:44,373 --> 00:04:47,934
- Yeah, we set the bad guys up, right?
- Why don't you shut up and listen.

42
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:50,088
You should be yelling at the cops
for beating up kids.

43
00:04:50,112 --> 00:04:52,239
You smacked Detective Tricky
in the mouth.

44
00:04:57,119 --> 00:05:00,953
Do you think this is a joke?
You little numb-nut.

45
00:05:01,023 --> 00:05:03,753
Okay, Bob, I'll take care of this.
Let me take care of this.

46
00:05:03,825 --> 00:05:05,486
- Yeah, Bob!
- Hey!

47
00:05:06,995 --> 00:05:09,361
Sit down and shut up. Sit!

48
00:05:11,667 --> 00:05:13,635
You think this is a joke?

49
00:05:13,702 --> 00:05:17,297
If you think it's a joke, I'll stick you
right back into the cells...

50
00:05:17,372 --> 00:05:19,499
where I found you.

51
00:05:19,574 --> 00:05:22,236
You're policemen now.
Stop screwing around...

52
00:05:22,311 --> 00:05:24,404
and start doing your job.

53
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:26,879
If you're gonna start overacting
like circus freaks...

54
00:05:26,948 --> 00:05:30,076
you might as well be wearin' badges,
for crying out loud!

55
00:05:30,152 --> 00:05:31,779
Are we done yet?

56
00:05:31,853 --> 00:05:34,822
- Excuse me?
- Are we done?

57
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:36,983
You're done when I say we're done.

58
00:05:37,059 --> 00:05:39,337
- Is that Harry? It looks like him.
- All right, everybody.

59
00:05:39,361 --> 00:05:42,421
- Listen up.
- Save it for the kiddies, Greer.

60
00:05:46,268 --> 00:05:48,202
That's pretty funny.

61
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:53,433
All right, tough guy.

62
00:05:53,508 --> 00:05:56,875
If you or anybody else
has got a problem with my squad...

63
00:05:56,945 --> 00:05:59,436
you gotta go through me first.

64
00:05:59,514 --> 00:06:00,947
Any takers?

65
00:06:44,326 --> 00:06:48,126
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

66
00:06:48,196 --> 00:06:50,221
Thanks for asking.

67
00:06:50,298 --> 00:06:52,377
Eckford and Lanier aren't here.
I got something to do.

68
00:06:52,401 --> 00:06:54,335
We'll get started without them.
Follow me.

69
00:06:56,571 --> 00:06:58,505
You guys see that club down there?

70
00:07:00,575 --> 00:07:04,534
We have reason to believe there's
a black book operation goin' on inside.

71
00:07:04,613 --> 00:07:08,242
- What's black book?
- Hookers. Expensive ones.

72
00:07:08,316 --> 00:07:11,843
Young girls. We also think
the manager, Red Wilson, is involved.

73
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:15,583
Julie, you go inside undercover as
a waitress and hopefully get recruited.

74
00:07:15,657 --> 00:07:18,455
Why does she always get to be
the prostitute?

75
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:21,223
You two will go inside,
split up, blend...

76
00:07:21,296 --> 00:07:24,356
work the room and keep your eye
on this Red character.

77
00:07:26,935 --> 00:07:29,165
All right, listen to me.

78
00:07:29,237 --> 00:07:31,262
Be nice to these guys.

79
00:07:31,339 --> 00:07:35,366
They've been on this case for a while.
They're not gonna like working with you.

80
00:07:35,444 --> 00:07:37,435
Do what they tell you to
and remember to...

81
00:07:37,512 --> 00:07:40,242
- Keep our noses clean?
- Exactly.

82
00:07:40,315 --> 00:07:43,375
- Sorry we're late, Adam.
- Yeah, sorry we're late.

83
00:07:43,452 --> 00:07:46,546
- Hey, no excuses, partner.
- You're not my partner.

84
00:07:47,923 --> 00:07:49,914
We went over the assignments
and the background.

85
00:07:49,991 --> 00:07:52,551
You guys work out the logistics
amongst yourselves.

86
00:07:58,733 --> 00:08:00,667
Which one's Eckford
and which one's Lanier?

87
00:08:00,735 --> 00:08:03,670
Save it. This is our case.

88
00:08:03,738 --> 00:08:06,036
We don't want you little pussies
playing cop inside.

89
00:08:06,107 --> 00:08:08,337
Making our J-O-B
all that much harder.

90
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:10,901
You dig?

91
00:08:12,881 --> 00:08:14,815
She comes in. Yeah.

92
00:08:16,284 --> 00:08:18,218
There you go, little girl.

93
00:08:18,286 --> 00:08:21,483
Two grams, asshole.

94
00:08:21,556 --> 00:08:25,185
- Call a cop.
- Fuck you, pig!

95
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:35,002
Are you okay?

96
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:40,269
- Yeah.
- You wanna come back inside?

97
00:09:17,245 --> 00:09:18,872
Excuse me.

98
00:09:18,947 --> 00:09:21,939
- Listen, I gotta meet up with Greer.
- What, now?

99
00:09:22,017 --> 00:09:24,178
Yeah, you know how the man is
about punctuality.

100
00:09:24,252 --> 00:09:26,277
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

101
00:09:26,354 --> 00:09:29,915
- Keep an eye out for Julie, okay?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

102
00:09:42,103 --> 00:09:44,333
Hey! How's it goin', girl?

103
00:09:47,542 --> 00:09:49,874
You wanna come up to my office
after your shift?

104
00:09:49,945 --> 00:09:52,413
I've been meaning to ask you
if I can work some extra hours.

105
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,812
- I can really use the cash.
- Yeah, yeah.

106
00:09:54,883 --> 00:09:59,217
Well, I, you know...
We'll see what we can do. Huh?

107
00:10:13,435 --> 00:10:15,733
You mind if I cut in?

108
00:10:17,939 --> 00:10:19,065
Hey, there.

109
00:10:23,945 --> 00:10:25,572
How you been? Long time.

110
00:10:27,148 --> 00:10:28,706
Yeah.

111
00:10:33,021 --> 00:10:36,582
God, what's it been,
like three years?

112
00:10:36,658 --> 00:10:41,618
I never thought I'd see you again.
You look really great, you know?

113
00:10:46,067 --> 00:10:48,558
- Can I get you a drink?
- Yeah.

114
00:10:48,637 --> 00:10:51,663
Can I get a club soda
with a lemon?

115
00:10:53,274 --> 00:10:54,571
Really?

116
00:10:54,643 --> 00:10:56,406
I have two years in July.

117
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:00,343
Right on.
Year and a half last month.

118
00:11:00,415 --> 00:11:03,316
Really? That's great.

119
00:11:07,222 --> 00:11:09,486
You been doin' this long or what?

120
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:14,951
- Sorry.
- It's all right.

121
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:17,931
I haven't seen that smile
in a long time.

122
00:11:21,403 --> 00:11:24,702
So, I guess I should let you
get back to work.

123
00:11:27,809 --> 00:11:29,299
Yeah.

124
00:11:32,881 --> 00:11:36,112
Hey, listen.
Can I see you again?

125
00:11:38,253 --> 00:11:39,311
Okay.

126
00:11:40,455 --> 00:11:41,513
Okay, then?

127
00:12:17,892 --> 00:12:19,826
Oh, my God!

128
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:27,063
- Tiffany!
- Uh-oh.

129
00:12:28,937 --> 00:12:30,666
What "uh-oh"?

130
00:12:39,314 --> 00:12:41,373
Okay, wait, wait.

131
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:50,385
Get up!

132
00:12:52,594 --> 00:12:54,755
Get the hell out of here!

133
00:13:04,706 --> 00:13:07,834
I saw Greer roll up on this cat
with leather pants.

134
00:13:07,909 --> 00:13:09,240
What?

135
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:13,440
The dude from the bust.
I saw Greer pick him up.

136
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:18,251
It was the same guy
I saw at the bust last week.

137
00:13:18,319 --> 00:13:23,416
- A cop was helping him get away.
- Are you sure it was Greer?

138
00:13:24,859 --> 00:13:28,260
- Looked like his car.
- Every car looks like his car.

139
00:13:28,329 --> 00:13:30,263
That's the point of the car.

140
00:13:30,331 --> 00:13:32,891
Dude, you're paranoid.

141
00:13:32,967 --> 00:13:35,435
Nice job!

142
00:13:35,503 --> 00:13:39,269
Okay, I really did not
like that at all, all right?

143
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:42,241
Let me just explain somethin'.
I was blending.

144
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:45,245
You just blended your ass
right out of the club, man.

145
00:13:45,313 --> 00:13:48,908
Oh, come on! They're gonna
let me back in the club.

146
00:13:48,983 --> 00:13:52,146
I believe the words were
"you're gone for-fucking-ever."

147
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:55,519
- Greer's gonna kick your ass.
- You know what? Eat me.

148
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:58,150
Come on. Let's go.
You wanna lose another fight, Petey?

149
00:13:58,226 --> 00:14:01,024
Who was the guy that
you were talkin' to all night?

150
00:14:01,095 --> 00:14:03,461
- What guy?
- Yeah, "what guy."

151
00:14:03,531 --> 00:14:05,123
A suspect?

152
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:08,363
What? No. I don't even know
what he's talkin' about.

153
00:14:08,436 --> 00:14:12,304
How could you see anything? You had your
head buried in a pair of tits all night.

154
00:14:12,373 --> 00:14:15,865
I could see things because
I got eyes behind my head, all right?

155
00:14:15,944 --> 00:14:19,243
- Julie's got a boyfriend
- Please grow up.

156
00:14:19,314 --> 00:14:22,442
Let's all together, in harmony.

157
00:14:22,517 --> 00:14:26,817
Hey, mommy! Where you goin'
with that fine little ass, baby?

158
00:14:26,888 --> 00:14:30,346
Why don't you get out in the street
and earn a real living, huh?

159
00:14:30,425 --> 00:14:32,290
- What?
- She digs me.

160
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:35,727
- You have your hall pass, young lady?
- You wanna see my hall pass?

161
00:14:35,797 --> 00:14:38,288
Yeah, and then I wanna see you
in detention.

162
00:14:38,366 --> 00:14:41,460
Why do you have to be such a pussy?
Leave her alone.

163
00:14:41,536 --> 00:14:43,731
Who you callin' a pussy, pussy?

164
00:14:43,805 --> 00:14:47,468
- Motherfucker.
- Oh, God, you terrify me.

165
00:14:47,542 --> 00:14:51,706
- Tricky, just back off, man.
- Get outta my face, boy.

166
00:14:51,779 --> 00:14:54,111
- What?
- Let's go. In my office.

167
00:14:54,182 --> 00:14:56,116
Move your ass.

168
00:14:56,184 --> 00:14:58,516
In my office. Move your ass!

169
00:15:10,498 --> 00:15:12,989
- Where were you last night?
- Excuse me?

170
00:15:13,067 --> 00:15:15,535
You left me out on the street
for, like, an hour.

171
00:15:15,603 --> 00:15:17,798
I was doin' something.

172
00:15:17,872 --> 00:15:20,864
I'd love to know what you were doin'
while I was out there waitin'.

173
00:15:20,942 --> 00:15:23,103
- It's a police matter.
- What's a police matter?

174
00:15:23,177 --> 00:15:25,322
- Shut your face.
- Why don't you try stealin' drugs...

175
00:15:25,346 --> 00:15:28,213
- from the evidence locker?
- What? What'd you say?

176
00:15:28,283 --> 00:15:29,944
Stealin' drugs
from the evidence locker.

177
00:15:30,018 --> 00:15:32,509
You better watch what you say
and who you're saying it to.

178
00:15:32,587 --> 00:15:34,919
- Let me tell you something, Linc.
- Save it.

179
00:15:34,989 --> 00:15:37,082
Shut up and listen to me.

180
00:15:37,158 --> 00:15:40,457
One of these days, you'll wake up
and be 30. Who knows? Maybe even 40.

181
00:15:40,528 --> 00:15:43,258
Get up when I talk to you.
Get up.

182
00:15:44,666 --> 00:15:47,191
And you're gonna be alone,
all alone.

183
00:15:47,268 --> 00:15:50,465
You're gonna realize not everybody
in this world is your enemy.

184
00:15:50,538 --> 00:15:55,908
I'm trying to do my job. I suggest you
do the same and quit breaking my balls.

185
00:15:58,913 --> 00:16:01,040
It's enough already.

186
00:16:03,618 --> 00:16:06,485
Get off my desk, please.

187
00:16:06,554 --> 00:16:10,115
- Is there any luck at the club?
- Look, Captain.

188
00:16:10,191 --> 00:16:14,855
We're just trying to get
really, really deep undercover.

189
00:16:14,929 --> 00:16:15,953
Yeah.

190
00:16:17,565 --> 00:16:19,897
- The manager's a real creep.
- Yeah? And?

191
00:16:19,968 --> 00:16:22,368
It feels like there's definitely
something going on in there.

192
00:16:22,403 --> 00:16:26,430
I don't care about feelings. This isn't
a feelings business. Get some evidence.

193
00:16:26,507 --> 00:16:29,237
You're on the roof
with Eckford and Lanier.

194
00:16:31,546 --> 00:16:35,414
Take off those stupid sunglasses
and do what you're told.

195
00:16:35,483 --> 00:16:37,178
Yes, sir.

196
00:16:37,251 --> 00:16:40,414
There are people breathing down my neck
to get rid of all three of you.

197
00:16:40,488 --> 00:16:43,013
- What'd we do?
- Arson, assault and robbery.

198
00:16:43,091 --> 00:16:47,187
Now, get out. And remember, I'm the only
thing keeping you clowns out of prison.

199
00:16:47,261 --> 00:16:50,788
- Man, this job sucks!
- Beats jail.

200
00:16:50,865 --> 00:16:52,799
A deal's a deal.

201
00:17:10,518 --> 00:17:12,383
- What the hell?
- Dude, they're not there.

202
00:17:12,453 --> 00:17:16,549
- What are you doin' in here?
- Eckford and Lanier.

203
00:17:17,759 --> 00:17:18,817
What?

204
00:17:18,893 --> 00:17:21,726
They never showed.
Give me the keys.

205
00:17:23,498 --> 00:17:27,491
- The keys to what?
- I got no car. This is a stakeout.

206
00:17:30,004 --> 00:17:32,165
- Are you crazy? Hell no.
- Come on!

207
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:36,540
This is a cop thing. You can't just
leave me standing there like an asshole.

208
00:17:36,611 --> 00:17:40,741
- I swear to God, man. One scratch...
- All right.

209
00:18:09,043 --> 00:18:13,036
- What can I get you, slick?
- I'll take a malt liquor, sister.

210
00:18:13,114 --> 00:18:16,311
I need you to find out everything
you can about this guy over there...

211
00:18:16,384 --> 00:18:19,376
with the blonde hair
and leather pants in the booth.

212
00:18:20,521 --> 00:18:22,113
Is he your guy?

213
00:18:22,857 --> 00:18:24,085
Yeah.

214
00:18:25,126 --> 00:18:27,060
All right.
I'll see what I can do.

215
00:18:48,783 --> 00:18:51,775
- What?
- It's so freaky to see you again.

216
00:18:51,853 --> 00:18:53,377
- Freaky?
- Yeah.

217
00:18:53,454 --> 00:18:57,151
- Maybe it's just the hair. I don't know.
- My hair?

218
00:19:00,194 --> 00:19:02,594
I wanna say that I'm sorry
about what happened before.

219
00:19:02,663 --> 00:19:06,121
About not calling
and disappearing like that.

220
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:09,192
- I was an asshole.
- Forget it. It was a long time ago.

221
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:11,750
- We were both really fucked up.
- Yeah, I know, but I'm sorry.

222
00:19:11,806 --> 00:19:15,572
- I'm sorry that I hurt you.
- Forgiven. It's over. We're movin' on.

223
00:19:17,278 --> 00:19:21,840
What are you doin' in this place
other than keeping me from my job?

224
00:19:21,916 --> 00:19:23,281
Take a break?

225
00:19:23,351 --> 00:19:25,581
Now?

226
00:19:25,653 --> 00:19:27,746
- Just to talk.
- Yeah.

227
00:19:36,164 --> 00:19:38,792
You can page me
if you need to talk to me.

228
00:19:38,866 --> 00:19:40,959
See ya!

229
00:19:41,035 --> 00:19:44,596
- Bye, Gilbert.
- Let's go. You can do this later.

230
00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:50,377
How are you doin'?

231
00:19:51,579 --> 00:19:55,242
- I'm all right.
- Are you here with someone?

232
00:19:55,316 --> 00:19:58,683
- No.
- Would you like to be?

233
00:20:00,588 --> 00:20:02,522
Maybe later. I gotta go.

234
00:20:08,396 --> 00:20:11,092
Not really goin' for
waitress of the month, are you?

235
00:20:11,165 --> 00:20:13,531
Apparently not. I missed you.

236
00:20:21,209 --> 00:20:23,143
- Hey, there.
- Hi.

237
00:20:24,612 --> 00:20:26,705
Whoa, whoa.
I thought we were just gonna talk.

238
00:20:26,781 --> 00:20:28,806
Oh, please.

239
00:20:31,652 --> 00:20:33,552
Hey, my man!

240
00:21:00,014 --> 00:21:02,847
Okay, give me the keys.
Give me the keys!

241
00:21:02,917 --> 00:21:05,249
Gilbert, no, man.
I'm giving you a ride. That's enough.

242
00:21:05,319 --> 00:21:07,253
Give me the keys.

243
00:21:09,156 --> 00:21:11,249
- Be careful.
- Always.

244
00:21:11,325 --> 00:21:13,190
- Pop the trunk.
- Why?

245
00:21:13,261 --> 00:21:17,357
Because it's cold and buggin'.
I want my jacket. Okay, Gilbert?

246
00:21:33,614 --> 00:21:36,139
Put on your jacket and let's go!

247
00:21:36,217 --> 00:21:38,310
- Ah, man!
- "Ah, man" what?

248
00:21:38,386 --> 00:21:40,251
- Hey.
- Cops!

249
00:21:40,321 --> 00:21:43,381
Cops? Shit!

250
00:21:43,457 --> 00:21:44,719
Get the car!

251
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,405
Shit!

252
00:22:00,474 --> 00:22:02,408
Shit, shit, shit!

253
00:22:16,123 --> 00:22:17,613
Come on, man!

254
00:22:44,685 --> 00:22:45,685
Sorry!

255
00:23:55,790 --> 00:23:57,223
Who's your friend?

256
00:23:57,291 --> 00:24:01,125
Look, man, I was just giving him
a lift, man. That's all.

257
00:24:01,195 --> 00:24:02,287
Where?

258
00:24:02,363 --> 00:24:05,025
Just under the Sixth St. bridge.
That was all.

259
00:24:05,099 --> 00:24:07,397
I was just gonna take him
under the Sixth St. bridge!

260
00:24:07,468 --> 00:24:09,402
His name's Gilbert O'Reilly.

261
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:13,167
I told him I'd give him a ride.
I was, like, designated driver.

262
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:15,299
You know, like a car pool.

263
00:24:15,376 --> 00:24:18,140
I'll take you to where he lives.
Okay, you want a car wash?

264
00:24:18,212 --> 00:24:21,579
I work at the Valley Car Wash.
I'll give you a free car wash...

265
00:24:21,649 --> 00:24:23,913
on the...

266
00:24:34,228 --> 00:24:36,696
Julie, someone said
they saw you come in here.

267
00:24:36,764 --> 00:24:39,892
- What?
- What are you doing in here?

268
00:24:39,967 --> 00:24:42,162
What do you think I'm doing, Red?

269
00:24:46,006 --> 00:24:50,670
I've been lookin' for you all night.
You're not supposed to be in the VIP.

270
00:24:50,744 --> 00:24:54,339
Finish up and get your ass
back down to work.

271
00:25:03,390 --> 00:25:04,789
Oh, my God.

272
00:25:05,793 --> 00:25:08,318
- I guess I should get back to work.
- Oh, really?

273
00:25:08,395 --> 00:25:10,522
Yeah. You can stay up here,
if you want.

274
00:25:10,598 --> 00:25:13,328
- You know what? I have to go.
- Oh, okay.

275
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:16,927
- I have to go to this club.
- That's cool.

276
00:25:17,004 --> 00:25:20,770
Look. Here's my number.
You call me. I mean it.

277
00:25:20,841 --> 00:25:24,743
Whenever you need anything,
anytime, please.

278
00:25:28,449 --> 00:25:32,351
- Okay?
- It's nice talking to you.

279
00:25:32,419 --> 00:25:34,444
It's nice talking to you too.

280
00:25:36,156 --> 00:25:37,885
- See you.
- See you.

281
00:25:42,496 --> 00:25:44,487
Oh, God.

282
00:25:48,269 --> 00:25:50,703
Linc, I can't believe it, man.

283
00:25:50,771 --> 00:25:52,705
I mean, I can't...

284
00:25:52,773 --> 00:25:56,072
I mean, I can't believe it, man.

285
00:25:57,611 --> 00:25:59,010
Dude...

286
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:03,946
If people could learn
to drive in this city!

287
00:26:08,322 --> 00:26:12,019
I'm gonna call my lawyer friend,
all right? No, no, no.

288
00:26:12,092 --> 00:26:14,083
Where you goin'?

289
00:26:14,161 --> 00:26:16,288
I gotta tell Jules we're goin'.

290
00:26:16,363 --> 00:26:18,695
What about that guy?

291
00:26:18,766 --> 00:26:22,361
I caught the guy.
He talked, and I let him go.

292
00:26:23,571 --> 00:26:25,163
All right.

293
00:26:41,422 --> 00:26:43,356
You sure about this, Linc?

294
00:26:43,424 --> 00:26:46,484
Look, the dude said the guys
are meeting a cop under this bridge.

295
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:49,427
Greer's got nothin'
to do with drugs, man.

296
00:26:49,496 --> 00:26:51,896
He helped me get sober, you know?

297
00:26:58,606 --> 00:27:01,336
Could you have parked
further away?

298
00:27:01,408 --> 00:27:03,933
- Precautions, man.
- Paranoid, man.

299
00:27:47,788 --> 00:27:49,688
Oh, my God.

300
00:27:49,757 --> 00:27:52,089
It's Greer.

301
00:27:53,794 --> 00:27:55,159
Oh, man.

302
00:28:02,302 --> 00:28:04,293
Oh, my... Oh, my God.

303
00:28:05,906 --> 00:28:09,501
I mean, I can't believe it.

304
00:28:17,384 --> 00:28:19,318
Is that cocaine?

305
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:35,234
So, what do we do?

306
00:28:35,302 --> 00:28:37,964
We gotta get
the hell out of here.

307
00:28:38,038 --> 00:28:40,370
I'm not gonna just leave him here.

308
00:28:40,441 --> 00:28:42,875
What are you talkin' about?
Let's go.

309
00:28:42,943 --> 00:28:46,777
Wait, wait, wait.
We're cops, all right?

310
00:28:46,847 --> 00:28:49,839
We're on the scene.
This is our job. All right?

311
00:28:49,917 --> 00:28:52,351
We're not that kind of cops, man.

312
00:28:54,254 --> 00:28:57,382
We gotta go now! Come on!

313
00:29:29,056 --> 00:29:30,990
You all right?

314
00:29:34,561 --> 00:29:36,654
I can't believe he's dead.

315
00:29:39,233 --> 00:29:43,533
They're gonna think we were in on it.
They're gonna come for us.

316
00:29:43,604 --> 00:29:46,129
Why would they come for us?

317
00:29:47,808 --> 00:29:50,936
Because we're in the clubs, Pete.
We're his kids.

318
00:29:52,279 --> 00:29:54,713
Greer wasn't like that.
It was a setup.

319
00:29:58,619 --> 00:30:00,610
All right, look.

320
00:30:00,687 --> 00:30:03,884
You were sick. We were giving you a lift
home. That's why we left the club.

321
00:30:03,957 --> 00:30:05,322
Okay? All right?

322
00:30:05,392 --> 00:30:06,723
Okay.

323
00:30:11,632 --> 00:30:13,998
Show time.

324
00:30:30,117 --> 00:30:33,644
I'm Detective Briggs, Internal Affairs.
I just got a few questions for you.

325
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:35,153
Okay.

326
00:30:35,222 --> 00:30:38,521
- Tell me where you were tonight.
- I don't know.

327
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:40,753
We sent a car over to the club.

328
00:30:40,828 --> 00:30:43,023
- None of you were there.
- Julie was sick.

329
00:30:43,096 --> 00:30:45,587
- How are you doing, Julie?
- I'm all right.

330
00:30:45,666 --> 00:30:47,691
- What was wrong?
- I don't know.

331
00:30:47,768 --> 00:30:50,464
Do I look like a doctor?
I said she wasn't feeling well.

332
00:30:50,537 --> 00:30:54,098
No, I was in the...
I was in the bar.

333
00:30:54,174 --> 00:30:56,335
- No work tonight?
- I had an upset stomach...

334
00:30:56,410 --> 00:30:59,004
so I left work early,
and Pete and Linc drove me home.

335
00:30:59,079 --> 00:31:02,207
No, no, no.
I was outside the bar.

336
00:31:02,282 --> 00:31:05,342
You guys must be gettin'
pretty tight.

337
00:31:05,419 --> 00:31:08,320
- Not really.
- Not really?

338
00:31:08,388 --> 00:31:11,619
Julie got sick in the bar,
and I had to take her home.

339
00:31:11,692 --> 00:31:16,129
I went in the bar to get Linc,
'cause I can't drive Linc's...

340
00:31:16,196 --> 00:31:19,654
- So you just took off?
- Eckford and Lanier, they left too.

341
00:31:19,733 --> 00:31:22,566
- Where were Eckford and Lanier?
- I don't know.

342
00:31:25,038 --> 00:31:28,633
- Ask me a question. Anything you want.
- Where were you when Greer got shot?

343
00:31:28,709 --> 00:31:30,006
What?

344
00:31:30,077 --> 00:31:32,511
- Greer's dead?
- Sorry.

345
00:31:32,579 --> 00:31:37,573
Two shots to the chest.
It looked like something exploded.

346
00:31:37,651 --> 00:31:40,984
You know what you're doin'? You're
tryin' to play on my emotions right now.

347
00:31:41,054 --> 00:31:45,013
That's what you're tryin' to do.
I know this whole game.

348
00:31:45,092 --> 00:31:47,219
I know...

349
00:31:47,294 --> 00:31:51,060
- What do you know?
- I don't know anything.

350
00:31:51,131 --> 00:31:53,599
Except that we found drugs
on the scene.

351
00:31:53,667 --> 00:31:56,329
Cocaine. We're running tests.

352
00:31:56,403 --> 00:31:59,861
We think it may be the stuff
from the evidence locker.

353
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:02,875
You look a little nervous, Pete.
Something you wanna tell me?

354
00:32:02,943 --> 00:32:06,777
- You know anything about drugs, Julie?
- Enough to stay away.

355
00:32:06,847 --> 00:32:08,610
Do I need to call a lawyer?

356
00:32:13,186 --> 00:32:16,587
Not yet. But we may need you
for additional questioning...

357
00:32:16,657 --> 00:32:19,023
so don't go anywhere.

358
00:32:24,665 --> 00:32:28,726
- Were you crying?
- No!

359
00:32:28,802 --> 00:32:30,895
How are you holding up?

360
00:32:30,971 --> 00:32:33,769
We're fine.

361
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:37,139
Well, they're suspending the unit,
pending further investigation.

362
00:32:45,485 --> 00:32:48,386
- What did Briggs tell you?
- Nothin'.

363
00:32:48,455 --> 00:32:52,551
Our captain's dead, they don't know what
happened and they found drugs on him.

364
00:32:52,626 --> 00:32:54,560
They think they're from
the evidence locker.

365
00:32:54,628 --> 00:32:56,562
Every man's gotta
make a living, right?

366
00:32:56,630 --> 00:32:59,064
Shut up.

367
00:32:59,132 --> 00:33:01,600
You didn't even know him.
He was a great cop. Shut up!

368
00:33:08,375 --> 00:33:10,343
A little too much coffee.

369
00:33:11,712 --> 00:33:14,010
Oh, baby.

370
00:33:20,253 --> 00:33:21,914
Look, um...

371
00:33:21,989 --> 00:33:24,685
I'm gonna do what I can
to get you back on.

372
00:33:24,758 --> 00:33:28,285
And I'm gonna do it because
it's what Adam Greer would've wanted.

373
00:33:28,362 --> 00:33:30,762
But you're gonna have
to lay low...

374
00:33:30,831 --> 00:33:33,925
for a while, so...

375
00:33:34,001 --> 00:33:37,664
I can't believe I'm doin' this.

376
00:33:37,738 --> 00:33:41,037
This is my address
and home phone.

377
00:33:43,243 --> 00:33:45,370
If you need anything.

378
00:33:46,947 --> 00:33:48,346
Thanks.

379
00:33:53,687 --> 00:33:55,621
He was my friend.

380
00:33:58,658 --> 00:34:00,592
Since when's he so friendly?

381
00:34:02,229 --> 00:34:05,858
- Since maybe his best friend just died.
- So what.

382
00:34:05,932 --> 00:34:07,832
So what?

383
00:34:09,569 --> 00:34:12,970
- You're an asshole. Greer was...
- Greer was what?

384
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:16,407
You're actin' like this guy was
your best friend. He wasn't your daddy.

385
00:34:20,847 --> 00:34:24,476
Fuck you! You guys wanna play like this
doesn't matter, like you don't care?

386
00:34:27,087 --> 00:34:28,486
Fine, I'm out.

387
00:35:30,951 --> 00:35:33,385
This is Billy. Leave a message,
and I'll get back to you.

388
00:35:50,237 --> 00:35:53,001
You ready to get
to the bottom of this?

389
00:35:55,642 --> 00:35:57,576
What do you mean?

390
00:35:57,644 --> 00:36:00,909
Well, for starters, we gotta
find that guy with the leather pants.

391
00:36:01,915 --> 00:36:04,611
So, what... How do you think
we're gonna do that?

392
00:36:05,919 --> 00:36:08,786
I know a friend of his.

393
00:36:17,497 --> 00:36:20,022
- For me?
- Is what for you?

394
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:23,001
- The fish?
- For you.

395
00:36:23,069 --> 00:36:24,696
Thank you.

396
00:36:24,771 --> 00:36:26,534
Can I come in?

397
00:36:26,606 --> 00:36:28,540
Yeah, I'm sorry. Of course.

398
00:36:28,608 --> 00:36:32,271
- Your address was listed, so...
- I'm so proud to have one.

399
00:36:34,848 --> 00:36:38,807
You sounded so depressed on the message.
I thought I'd come by and cheer you up.

400
00:36:38,885 --> 00:36:40,750
Thank you.

401
00:36:43,690 --> 00:36:45,851
God, I must look like shit.
I've been asleep all day.

402
00:36:45,926 --> 00:36:48,986
- That's not possible.
- Yeah, actually.

403
00:36:54,334 --> 00:36:57,360
- I'm sorry. Whoops.
- It's all right. It's okay.

404
00:36:59,673 --> 00:37:02,107
That the perp's place, bro?

405
00:37:02,175 --> 00:37:05,008
- Yeah.
- Stop, bro.

406
00:37:05,078 --> 00:37:09,208
- Stop, stop.
- What?

407
00:37:09,282 --> 00:37:11,978
I think I should drive in
and make the collar.

408
00:37:12,052 --> 00:37:15,021
Are you crazy? Man, you're lucky
I let you ride in the car.

409
00:37:15,088 --> 00:37:17,818
Dude, the guy knows
what you look like, all right?

410
00:37:17,891 --> 00:37:19,256
So?

411
00:37:20,427 --> 00:37:22,361
Dude, your cover's been blown,
all right?

412
00:37:22,429 --> 00:37:26,661
Your cover's been blown.
Your cover has been blown. All right?

413
00:37:27,968 --> 00:37:30,232
I gotta do it. That's it.

414
00:37:31,471 --> 00:37:34,736
Dude, I'm gonna go in there
and I'm gonna bring him out.

415
00:37:36,776 --> 00:37:40,041
Bro, I'm still under. I got it.

416
00:38:36,703 --> 00:38:38,295
Oh, shit!

417
00:38:38,371 --> 00:38:40,635
Shit! Shit!

418
00:38:43,009 --> 00:38:44,909
Stop! Police!

419
00:39:08,268 --> 00:39:10,634
Hey! Somebody grab that guy!

420
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:15,339
Grab that guy!

421
00:39:35,962 --> 00:39:37,452
Goddamn it!

422
00:39:37,530 --> 00:39:40,863
Look, I told you, man,
that's not even my stuff, okay?

423
00:39:40,934 --> 00:39:42,959
It's some... What?

424
00:39:43,036 --> 00:39:46,631
I was just giving Gilbert a ride
to meet some cop.

425
00:39:46,706 --> 00:39:50,802
It was just a car pool situation.
That's not a crime. Just savin' gas.

426
00:39:58,318 --> 00:40:01,378
Dude, I'm sorry about the car.
He was gettin' away.

427
00:40:01,454 --> 00:40:03,388
I mean, what do you
want me to do?

428
00:40:05,625 --> 00:40:09,152
- Dude, it's just water.
- Save it!

429
00:40:09,229 --> 00:40:11,789
Look, where's leather pants live?

430
00:40:11,865 --> 00:40:13,890
- Who?
- Gilbert O'Reilly.

431
00:40:13,967 --> 00:40:16,162
Look, are you guys really cops?

432
00:40:16,236 --> 00:40:19,364
- 'Cause my boss is just...
- Dude, we're undercover.

433
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:24,103
Really? What'd he do, anyway?

434
00:40:24,177 --> 00:40:26,907
Dude, we think he killed
our boss, all right?

435
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:29,346
Would you shut up?

436
00:40:29,416 --> 00:40:31,884
Yeah, shut up, man!

437
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:37,449
- You keep tickling me.
- Hold still! I gotta concentrate.

438
00:40:37,524 --> 00:40:39,082
Come on!

439
00:40:39,159 --> 00:40:41,787
- You're being... What're you doin'?
- I gotta go.

440
00:40:41,861 --> 00:40:44,557
- No, you don't.
- Yes, I do. I gotta go.

441
00:40:45,298 --> 00:40:46,731
Why?

442
00:40:47,834 --> 00:40:49,859
I gotta go meet my sponsor.

443
00:40:54,607 --> 00:40:56,632
You're gonna wear my lipstick?

444
00:41:01,648 --> 00:41:04,412
This is my address, okay?

445
00:41:07,654 --> 00:41:10,953
And next week,
I'm gonna cook you dinner.

446
00:41:11,024 --> 00:41:14,152
Since when do you know
how to cook?

447
00:41:14,227 --> 00:41:16,161
I have a week. I'll learn.

448
00:41:18,898 --> 00:41:20,832
- See you.
- See you.

449
00:41:45,425 --> 00:41:47,950
- Watch the car.
- Sorry, man.

450
00:41:51,764 --> 00:41:54,130
- Sure he lives here?
- Yeah.

451
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:58,660
You know, he's a surfer guy,
so he likes to be near the water.

452
00:41:58,738 --> 00:42:00,330
Knock?

453
00:42:06,379 --> 00:42:09,246
I don't think he's home.

454
00:42:09,315 --> 00:42:11,647
Stand back. Stand back!

455
00:42:11,718 --> 00:42:15,381
Oh, shit.
What the hell is wrong with you, man?

456
00:42:15,455 --> 00:42:17,616
- Bro, stand back.
- Where'd you get that from?

457
00:42:17,690 --> 00:42:20,056
Dude, it's my dad's.

458
00:42:20,126 --> 00:42:23,027
Oh, yeah.
You know how to use it?

459
00:42:23,096 --> 00:42:25,121
Bro, you just point and shoot.

460
00:42:25,198 --> 00:42:27,826
Look, just don't point
and shoot at me.

461
00:42:27,901 --> 00:42:30,961
You know what? No guns, okay?

462
00:42:31,037 --> 00:42:32,800
- Guns are bad.
- Shut up!

463
00:42:32,872 --> 00:42:35,363
- I know a guy once...
- Shut up!

464
00:42:37,677 --> 00:42:40,202
Do a perimeter search, all right?
Cover me.

465
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:42,771
- With what?
- Cover me.

466
00:43:04,971 --> 00:43:06,905
Are you nuts?

467
00:43:09,576 --> 00:43:11,510
All right.

468
00:43:13,012 --> 00:43:14,946
What do we do now?

469
00:43:16,783 --> 00:43:20,776
- We wait.
- Cops wait.

470
00:44:18,711 --> 00:44:20,235
Hello?

471
00:44:20,313 --> 00:44:22,247
I think I have the wrong number.

472
00:44:33,026 --> 00:44:35,494
- Hello?
- Who's this?

473
00:44:35,561 --> 00:44:38,758
- Who's this?
- Who's this?

474
00:44:38,831 --> 00:44:41,231
I told you not to pick up
the fuckin' phone!

475
00:44:53,813 --> 00:44:55,405
Hello. Yellow Cab.

476
00:44:55,481 --> 00:44:57,949
Can I get a cab
over at Hollywood and Vine?

477
00:45:08,795 --> 00:45:10,729
- Pull over here.
- All right.

478
00:45:12,865 --> 00:45:14,457
Here you go.

479
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:22,335
Well?

480
00:45:24,177 --> 00:45:26,737
- Hold on. Wait a second.
- All right.

481
00:45:43,362 --> 00:45:44,989
Follow that Caddie.

482
00:45:45,064 --> 00:45:46,588
You got it.

483
00:46:24,837 --> 00:46:26,964
- Here you go.
- Keep the change.

484
00:47:00,072 --> 00:47:02,131
Come on.
Do some business with me.

485
00:47:02,208 --> 00:47:04,233
Do you see I'm busy?

486
00:47:04,310 --> 00:47:06,288
- Leave me alone.
- It'll just take a couple minutes.

487
00:47:06,312 --> 00:47:11,750
I'll leave you alone as soon as we deal
with this in the back with some privacy.

488
00:47:11,818 --> 00:47:15,879
- You're driving me crazy.
- All right. Shut up!

489
00:47:15,955 --> 00:47:18,924
I love you, sweetheart.
You know, you're a pain in the ass.

490
00:47:18,991 --> 00:47:20,925
- Come on.
- You're a pain in the ass!

491
00:47:20,993 --> 00:47:24,258
Yeah, but you love me. I'm a pain
in the ass, but you love my ass.

492
00:47:46,819 --> 00:47:49,481
You're making me laugh.
You wanna make a big deal with me?

493
00:47:49,555 --> 00:47:51,489
I know you got something
goin' down...

494
00:47:51,557 --> 00:47:53,491
with one of your bands and drugs...

495
00:47:53,559 --> 00:47:56,392
You leave the fuckin' boys
outta this!

496
00:47:56,462 --> 00:47:58,396
- They can really rock and roll.
- What?

497
00:47:58,464 --> 00:48:01,627
This is a joke, right?
You are a pimp, Billy.

498
00:48:01,701 --> 00:48:04,966
A pimp. You do drugs.
That doesn't mean you should sell 'em.

499
00:48:05,037 --> 00:48:07,130
Just say no, man.

500
00:48:07,206 --> 00:48:10,972
Just tell me when and where it's goin'
down and I will bring the cash, okay?

501
00:48:11,043 --> 00:48:14,740
You wanna be a big shot?
You wanna make the big fuckin' deal?

502
00:48:14,814 --> 00:48:18,250
Okay, you're in. But you better not
mess with me or I'll crush your balls.

503
00:48:18,317 --> 00:48:21,980
- I would not mess with you.
- Or the band. They really got a future.

504
00:48:22,054 --> 00:48:25,046
- Okay, okay. Can I use your phone?
- Who are you gonna call?

505
00:48:25,124 --> 00:48:27,684
I'm gonna call the cops, Howard.

506
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:30,228
Funny, very funny.
Keep it local.

507
00:48:38,037 --> 00:48:41,268
Bob? Hey. Yeah,
I just talked to him. Deal's set.

508
00:48:41,340 --> 00:48:46,334
You relax, Bob. None of them have
any idea that I know they're cops.

509
00:48:46,412 --> 00:48:49,609
Especially her. Look,
I'm her goddamn dream man, okay?

510
00:48:49,682 --> 00:48:53,243
No, you listen to me! If you wanna have
somebody else take a shot...

511
00:48:53,319 --> 00:48:55,753
like Tricky or one of
the other men in blue that...

512
00:48:57,590 --> 00:49:00,218
The what? All right.

513
00:49:00,293 --> 00:49:03,694
I gotta go. Something's come up.

514
00:49:03,763 --> 00:49:06,425
I gotta go. Bye.

515
00:49:07,967 --> 00:49:11,266
- Wow.
- Hi, baby.

516
00:49:11,337 --> 00:49:13,202
- Is this for me?
- Mm-hmm.

517
00:49:13,272 --> 00:49:15,297
Really? Come here.

518
00:49:51,577 --> 00:49:53,511
Dude, I think there's something
down there, bro.

519
00:49:53,579 --> 00:49:55,604
- What?
- I don't know. Wait!

520
00:49:55,681 --> 00:49:57,774
I hear some voices down there.

521
00:49:57,850 --> 00:50:01,183
- It's the ocean.
- Wait. No, listen.

522
00:50:02,488 --> 00:50:04,854
Get back in the car.

523
00:50:04,924 --> 00:50:08,655
Get back in the car.
No, I will shoot you.

524
00:50:08,728 --> 00:50:11,788
- Get back in the car.
- All right.

525
00:50:13,332 --> 00:50:15,800
Let's go.

526
00:50:31,017 --> 00:50:34,043
Be quiet, Gilbert. All right?

527
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:36,020
Sit down!

528
00:50:39,925 --> 00:50:41,517
Bye, Gilbert.

529
00:51:09,822 --> 00:51:12,052
Man, I thought I told you, no guns.

530
00:51:27,473 --> 00:51:28,906
My ankle! Shit!

531
00:51:36,916 --> 00:51:38,713
Oh, Jesus. Who's this?

532
00:51:38,784 --> 00:51:40,718
- Beats me.
- Come on.

533
00:51:40,786 --> 00:51:43,220
Let's dump him in the trailer
with Gilbert.

534
00:52:04,777 --> 00:52:07,007
I gotta go.
I gotta get out of here.

535
00:52:07,079 --> 00:52:09,013
All right?

536
00:52:11,183 --> 00:52:13,674
- Where are you goin', man?
- I don't know, man.

537
00:52:13,752 --> 00:52:17,779
I just gotta go, all right?
What are you gonna do, hit me?

538
00:52:20,392 --> 00:52:24,260
- Yeah, right.
- Don't be stupid, Pete.

539
00:52:27,199 --> 00:52:29,394
You're callin' me stupid?

540
00:52:29,468 --> 00:52:34,667
I got a fucked up ankle.
I got brain and blood all over my body.

541
00:52:34,740 --> 00:52:38,267
And I'm fuckin' stupid.
You know what? Fuck you!

542
00:52:40,746 --> 00:52:44,079
You know what, man?
You wanna leave? Go ahead, my man.

543
00:52:44,150 --> 00:52:46,084
Matter of fact, take my keys.

544
00:52:46,152 --> 00:52:48,279
I don't give a shit.

545
00:54:36,695 --> 00:54:40,028
His head just exploded, like,
all over the place, all over everything.

546
00:54:40,099 --> 00:54:43,591
All over my clothes, my face,
all over...

547
00:54:43,669 --> 00:54:47,935
And then I dropped Linc off at home...

548
00:54:48,007 --> 00:54:51,773
and then I left, you know,
and I just...

549
00:54:51,844 --> 00:54:56,110
I needed someone to talk to
about this whole situation.

550
00:55:07,122 --> 00:55:09,283
I don't want that anymore.

551
00:55:10,692 --> 00:55:12,626
Tough night, Pete.

552
00:55:15,130 --> 00:55:16,654
It's gonna be okay.

553
00:55:16,731 --> 00:55:20,098
I want you to go home,
and I want you to get some rest.

554
00:55:22,304 --> 00:55:26,570
I'm gonna take care of this for you.
I don't know how, but I'm gonna do it.

555
00:55:26,641 --> 00:55:32,443
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to wake you so early.

556
00:55:32,514 --> 00:55:36,883
I hope I didn't wake you up
or disturb your wife or anything.

557
00:55:38,487 --> 00:55:40,421
My wife.

558
00:55:46,595 --> 00:55:50,053
So did you get a look
at these two guys? Hello.

559
00:55:50,131 --> 00:55:51,496
- Yeah.
- What?

560
00:55:51,566 --> 00:55:53,932
What did they look like? Yeah.

561
00:55:54,002 --> 00:55:57,870
I never said that there were two...

562
00:55:57,939 --> 00:56:01,705
No, no. All right.
Have a good time.

563
00:56:01,776 --> 00:56:04,506
No, I think it was too dark...

564
00:56:04,579 --> 00:56:06,171
for me to see anything.

565
00:56:06,248 --> 00:56:09,547
Listen. I have to take this call
in the other room.

566
00:56:09,618 --> 00:56:11,017
It's my wife.

567
00:56:11,086 --> 00:56:13,611
Oh, yeah.

568
00:56:16,391 --> 00:56:20,487
Can't you understand I'm tied up?

569
00:56:20,562 --> 00:56:24,794
Not here.
Am I speaking French to you?

570
00:56:43,652 --> 00:56:45,483
What the hell? Not the yard!

571
00:57:53,788 --> 00:57:57,554
- Hey, leave a message after the beep.
- Hey, Linc, you didn't say our na...

572
00:57:57,626 --> 00:58:00,493
Linc, if you get this message,
do not go back to the apartment.

573
00:58:00,562 --> 00:58:02,587
There's cops all over the place.

574
00:58:02,664 --> 00:58:06,259
Just meet me and Julie down at that
place at the beach tomorrow morning.

575
00:58:18,346 --> 00:58:20,280
Hi, Mom.

576
00:58:25,787 --> 00:58:27,778
What's happened to you?

577
00:58:31,226 --> 00:58:35,856
Well, you know,
things are pretty fucked up, Ma.

578
00:58:35,930 --> 00:58:38,057
Don't use that foul language with me.

579
00:58:38,133 --> 00:58:40,693
Who is it, honey?

580
00:58:43,104 --> 00:58:45,231
Hi, Dad.

581
00:58:46,374 --> 00:58:47,636
What do you want?

582
00:58:50,812 --> 00:58:53,906
Let me get you
some clean clothes, okay?

583
00:59:00,955 --> 00:59:03,048
Well, I was...

584
00:59:03,124 --> 00:59:06,287
- I was just... You know, I just...
- We're not bailing you out.

585
00:59:07,929 --> 00:59:11,023
What? What do you mean,
you're not bailing me out?

586
00:59:11,099 --> 00:59:13,761
The police already came by.

587
00:59:13,835 --> 00:59:17,931
What? No, no.
The police are in on it, Dad.

588
00:59:18,006 --> 00:59:20,839
- Come on. Save it.
- No, listen to me. Just for a second.

589
00:59:20,909 --> 00:59:23,639
I'm a police officer now, Dad.

590
00:59:23,712 --> 00:59:26,476
- Oh, you're a police officer?
- Yes, I'm a police officer.

591
00:59:26,548 --> 00:59:29,517
Here we go.
Some clean clothes, honey.

592
00:59:29,584 --> 00:59:33,384
- Now clean up. You're a mess.
- I don't need clean clothes right now.

593
00:59:33,455 --> 00:59:36,083
- They're his.
- Officer Pete?

594
00:59:38,226 --> 00:59:40,820
Why are you laughing at me?

595
00:59:43,465 --> 00:59:46,866
Officer Pete. Betty,
you know, at least he got a haircut.

596
00:59:46,935 --> 00:59:50,701
Maybe when they make him captain,
they'll give him a uniform.

597
00:59:50,772 --> 00:59:53,172
Why don't you just
give him a chance?

598
01:00:24,172 --> 01:00:26,606
I'm sorry about your guy.

599
01:00:32,881 --> 01:00:35,645
He wasn't my guy.

600
01:00:39,020 --> 01:00:40,954
Well, I guess not.

601
01:00:42,023 --> 01:00:43,957
He's a pimp.

602
01:00:46,327 --> 01:00:48,261
He's not sober.

603
01:00:51,432 --> 01:00:54,629
And on the phone he was saying
something about Tricky.

604
01:00:57,639 --> 01:01:00,335
The guy was playing with me
the entire time.

605
01:01:16,024 --> 01:01:18,356
Well, I think everything's
gonna be okay.

606
01:01:21,529 --> 01:01:23,463
You think?

607
01:01:24,866 --> 01:01:26,993
It just feels good to say it.

608
01:01:57,866 --> 01:02:00,232
- Good night.
- Good night.

609
01:02:13,681 --> 01:02:15,842
If you need to go to a meeting...

610
01:02:15,917 --> 01:02:18,442
tomorrow morning...

611
01:02:18,519 --> 01:02:23,047
then I can go down
to the pier by myself.

612
01:02:23,124 --> 01:02:25,058
No, it's okay.

613
01:02:26,628 --> 01:02:28,061
Thanks.

614
01:03:03,331 --> 01:03:05,265
Would you just hold me?

615
01:03:21,249 --> 01:03:23,183
Thanks for being here.

616
01:03:26,020 --> 01:03:27,954
You too.

617
01:03:41,970 --> 01:03:45,201
Damn, Sonny, what took you so long?
I was waitin' out there forever.

618
01:03:45,273 --> 01:03:48,640
What, I don't get no
"Hello. I miss you.

619
01:03:48,710 --> 01:03:53,113
Sorry I didn't call your ass
until I needed some shit"?

620
01:03:53,181 --> 01:03:55,342
What happened to you?
What's with the fishin' hat?

621
01:03:56,517 --> 01:03:58,849
I'm tryin' to stay
on the undercover, man.

622
01:03:58,920 --> 01:04:00,880
Penitentiary life ain't good
for a brother, is it?

623
01:04:00,922 --> 01:04:02,856
You got the info or what, man?

624
01:04:02,924 --> 01:04:05,552
Your man Gilbert O'Reilly was dealin'.

625
01:04:05,626 --> 01:04:07,821
What you mean "was"?

626
01:04:07,895 --> 01:04:12,662
It was on the news. They found him at
the beach with another dude, both dead.

627
01:04:12,734 --> 01:04:16,727
Cops said it was a murder-suicide.
I think it was some S-M shit myself.

628
01:04:17,805 --> 01:04:20,035
All right, look, Sonny, man.

629
01:04:20,108 --> 01:04:22,633
I'm gonna need to borrow your car.

630
01:04:22,710 --> 01:04:25,838
Hell, no. You might be named
after Lincoln who freed the slaves...

631
01:04:25,913 --> 01:04:28,381
but I ain't about
to free my wheels up, man.

632
01:04:28,449 --> 01:04:31,077
I got some shit goin' down tonight.

633
01:04:31,152 --> 01:04:33,586
I could use a partner
like the old days, you know?

634
01:04:33,654 --> 01:04:37,112
- Don't waste your breath.
- You know you can run now.

635
01:04:37,191 --> 01:04:40,183
- Sonny.
- Track star!

636
01:04:40,261 --> 01:04:44,027
Just consider this my way of keeping
your skinny ass out of a life of crime.

637
01:04:44,098 --> 01:04:46,362
Don't save me
from a life of crime, man.

638
01:04:46,434 --> 01:04:48,766
Crime pays. Well.

639
01:05:03,518 --> 01:05:05,850
Did you ever break-dance
when you were in school?

640
01:05:08,656 --> 01:05:11,625
- I imagine you did, though.
- I can break-dance.

641
01:05:17,231 --> 01:05:18,664
Disgusting.

642
01:05:21,169 --> 01:05:25,162
I'm like a ladies' man.
I love to dance.

643
01:05:29,911 --> 01:05:31,879
Knock it off.

644
01:05:31,946 --> 01:05:33,573
- What?
- Looking.

645
01:05:33,648 --> 01:05:35,582
Oh, come on.

646
01:06:02,110 --> 01:06:04,977
Oh, man!
What did you do to my car, man?

647
01:06:05,046 --> 01:06:07,640
- Oh, shit.
- Look at this.

648
01:06:07,715 --> 01:06:09,675
- What did you do to my goddamn car?
- Linc, wait.

649
01:06:09,717 --> 01:06:14,245
Wait. Okay. Just don't say anything
for a second. Let me just explain it.

650
01:06:14,322 --> 01:06:18,759
Let me just explain it,
all right?

651
01:06:18,826 --> 01:06:24,230
- He said something about a big deal.
- Jules, it makes total sense, man.

652
01:06:24,298 --> 01:06:26,232
Last night
I stopped in on a friend.

653
01:06:26,300 --> 01:06:28,734
Got the car, some clothes,
and I got some information.

654
01:06:28,803 --> 01:06:31,135
Turns out that Gilbert
was Tricky's snitch.

655
01:06:31,205 --> 01:06:33,173
Here you go.

656
01:06:33,241 --> 01:06:37,007
I didn't know if you wanted cream
or half and half or sugar or Equal or...

657
01:06:37,078 --> 01:06:40,536
Black's fine. It's fine.

658
01:06:40,615 --> 01:06:43,083
- All right.
- Did I miss something?

659
01:06:47,155 --> 01:06:50,022
- You sure?
- Yes.

660
01:06:50,091 --> 01:06:52,855
Check it out.
All right. Here's what we got.

661
01:06:52,927 --> 01:06:55,725
Now Billy's workin' something,
runnin' with the men in blue.

662
01:06:55,796 --> 01:06:57,774
And Gilbert definitely
didn't take out the bald guy...

663
01:06:57,798 --> 01:06:59,857
so he probably
didn't cap himself either.

664
01:06:59,934 --> 01:07:03,165
So since Gilbert was Tricky's snitch,
he's hooked in too.

665
01:07:03,237 --> 01:07:05,215
And whoever stole the drugs
from the evidence locker...

666
01:07:05,239 --> 01:07:06,706
was trying to frame Captain Greer.

667
01:07:06,774 --> 01:07:09,766
Wait. No, I didn't hear
anything you guys just said.

668
01:07:09,844 --> 01:07:12,608
The cops, man... Tricky,
Eckford, Lanier, the whole gang...

669
01:07:12,680 --> 01:07:14,705
They're all into something.

670
01:07:14,782 --> 01:07:17,945
No. Mothershed. When I was at his house,
he said there were two guys.

671
01:07:18,019 --> 01:07:20,954
- And I never even said that.
- Yeah, right.

672
01:07:21,022 --> 01:07:25,322
Whatever they got goin' got something
to do with Billy, Gilbert and drugs.

673
01:07:26,460 --> 01:07:32,160
This is like one of those dirty cop
drug things. This shit really happens?

674
01:07:32,233 --> 01:07:34,360
- Looks that way.
- And Greer was onto him.

675
01:07:34,435 --> 01:07:37,666
That's why there was all
that secret stuff before he died.

676
01:07:40,741 --> 01:07:42,675
That's why he died.

677
01:07:46,380 --> 01:07:49,213
He was trying to protect us.

678
01:07:49,283 --> 01:07:50,716
Yeah.

679
01:07:51,986 --> 01:07:53,920
So what now?

680
01:07:56,290 --> 01:07:59,748
You know, we need to get some evidence.
We need some evidence.

681
01:08:00,828 --> 01:08:03,729
Just trust me. They all
gotta meet up and go over the plan.

682
01:08:03,798 --> 01:08:05,891
- Really?
- Look, these stupid motherfuckers...

683
01:08:05,967 --> 01:08:07,901
are nothin' if not predictable, man.

684
01:08:09,937 --> 01:08:13,395
- So how long do we do this?
- Till something happens.

685
01:08:14,575 --> 01:08:18,841
Is this all that cops do...
Sit around in cars, waiting?

686
01:08:18,913 --> 01:08:20,847
We can go get some doughnuts.

687
01:08:28,055 --> 01:08:29,989
I gotta pee.

688
01:08:42,703 --> 01:08:43,965
What did I tell you?

689
01:08:44,038 --> 01:08:46,700
Looks like that's all of 'em.

690
01:08:48,576 --> 01:08:51,067
- I'm goin' in.
- What?

691
01:08:51,145 --> 01:08:53,238
Pete, your ankle's all messed up.

692
01:08:53,314 --> 01:08:55,077
I'm good at this. Don't worry.

693
01:08:55,149 --> 01:08:56,707
We'll all go.

694
01:08:56,784 --> 01:08:58,843
No. It's too much noise.
Don't worry about it.

695
01:08:58,919 --> 01:09:01,888
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I got it.

696
01:09:05,626 --> 01:09:08,117
You really think
he can pull this off?

697
01:09:09,597 --> 01:09:11,656
That's it. We don't want
no more to do with this.

698
01:09:11,732 --> 01:09:13,700
Come on, Carl.
Don't be such a pussy.

699
01:09:13,768 --> 01:09:15,793
- Don't call me a pussy.
- Fuck you, motherfucker.

700
01:09:15,870 --> 01:09:18,100
- See what this thing is doing to us?
- What?

701
01:09:18,172 --> 01:09:22,268
- We out of here.
- Ah, shit. Come on, Carl. Come here.

702
01:09:22,343 --> 01:09:25,403
- This was supposed to be about drugs.
- Two people are dead.

703
01:09:25,479 --> 01:09:27,879
- Three.
- What?

704
01:09:27,948 --> 01:09:31,543
- The bald guy at Gilbert's.
- Couldn't be helped.

705
01:09:31,619 --> 01:09:33,917
Look, Gilbert was an asshole.

706
01:09:33,988 --> 01:09:35,922
Almost gettin' arrested
at the bust...

707
01:09:35,990 --> 01:09:38,618
not stayin' away after we fired him,
talkin' to Greer.

708
01:09:38,693 --> 01:09:40,320
Little shit deserved to die.

709
01:09:40,394 --> 01:09:44,626
- Why did you have to kill Greer?
- He knew about us and the drugs, okay?

710
01:09:44,699 --> 01:09:46,633
Got in the way.

711
01:09:47,702 --> 01:09:50,967
- This is bad. I want out.
- Yeah, me too.

712
01:09:51,038 --> 01:09:53,063
It's too late for that, Carl.

713
01:09:55,242 --> 01:09:56,675
Come on.

714
01:10:00,448 --> 01:10:02,439
This is our lives, asshole.

715
01:10:02,516 --> 01:10:05,849
Now, you wanna get in our way,
you take your best shot.

716
01:10:05,920 --> 01:10:08,115
But I ain't guaranteein'
where you'll end up.

717
01:10:08,189 --> 01:10:11,420
Ernie, come on.
Put it down, man.

718
01:10:11,492 --> 01:10:13,084
We're all in this to the end, right?

719
01:10:13,160 --> 01:10:16,926
If this deal goes through,
we're set for life. Come on.

720
01:10:19,166 --> 01:10:21,100
So what's the plan?

721
01:10:21,168 --> 01:10:23,136
Over here. I'm wet. Come on.

722
01:10:24,205 --> 01:10:26,332
All right. Here it is.

723
01:10:26,407 --> 01:10:30,002
Billy set up a big deal
with this rock manager Howard.

724
01:10:30,077 --> 01:10:32,511
- You sure we can trust this Billy guy?
- Yeah.

725
01:10:32,580 --> 01:10:35,549
He did a good job sellin' the drugs
after we got rid of Gilbert.

726
01:10:35,616 --> 01:10:37,743
And this new deal is his idea anyhow.

727
01:10:37,818 --> 01:10:40,844
You see, this Howard guy...
He's got some famous rock band...

728
01:10:40,921 --> 01:10:42,980
flyin' in,
and the drugs are on the plane.

729
01:10:43,057 --> 01:10:47,517
- Who's the band?
- How should I know who the band is?

730
01:10:47,595 --> 01:10:49,529
It's just voices on a tape, man.

731
01:10:49,597 --> 01:10:52,532
To hell with voices on a tape.
We bring this to IA. That's it.

732
01:10:52,600 --> 01:10:55,194
Pete, Linc's right.
They're not gonna believe it.

733
01:10:55,269 --> 01:10:59,365
Look. We can't trust anybody,
all right? It's just us.

734
01:10:59,440 --> 01:11:01,374
Oh, God.

735
01:11:04,311 --> 01:11:06,404
Okay, so... Then, wh...

736
01:11:06,480 --> 01:11:08,641
Sorry. What do you wanna do?

737
01:11:08,716 --> 01:11:10,650
I know where the rock manager lives.

738
01:11:10,718 --> 01:11:13,209
We have to find out when
and where it's happening.

739
01:11:13,287 --> 01:11:16,882
Fine. I'll go over there, I'll get tight
with them, and I'll find out something.

740
01:11:16,957 --> 01:11:20,723
You can't do that, 'cause if Billy's
there, you're dead. He can make us.

741
01:11:20,795 --> 01:11:22,729
I got Billy.

742
01:11:24,665 --> 01:11:27,896
- Are you sure?
- Anybody got a better idea?

743
01:11:27,968 --> 01:11:30,232
Then I got your back, Julie.

744
01:11:30,304 --> 01:11:31,896
All right.

745
01:11:31,972 --> 01:11:36,238
Leave a message at home and let us know
what's goin' on, all right?

746
01:11:36,310 --> 01:11:40,440
All right. Let's do it.

747
01:11:58,632 --> 01:12:01,192
Where you been? I called your house.
I called the club.

748
01:12:01,268 --> 01:12:03,759
- They said you're not working anymore.
- I quit.

749
01:12:05,973 --> 01:12:08,032
I'm not a very good waitress.

750
01:12:08,108 --> 01:12:10,941
What happened?
Did I do something wrong?

751
01:12:11,011 --> 01:12:15,311
No, everything's fine.
No, I was looking for you too.

752
01:12:15,382 --> 01:12:17,282
You were lookin' for me too?

753
01:12:17,351 --> 01:12:19,444
Yeah.

754
01:12:19,520 --> 01:12:22,114
Well, here I am.

755
01:12:49,450 --> 01:12:51,884
What?

756
01:12:51,952 --> 01:12:54,477
Says Billy sent him over.

757
01:12:54,555 --> 01:12:57,888
There. Sit down.
Oh, I'm so sorry about the mess.

758
01:12:57,958 --> 01:13:01,917
- I'm redecorating. Yeah?
- I know you told me to stay in there.

759
01:13:03,097 --> 01:13:04,689
Can I get a soda?

760
01:13:05,933 --> 01:13:08,663
- Soda. I'm thirsty.
- You're thirsty.

761
01:13:11,338 --> 01:13:14,068
I'm sorry.
My little baby is thirsty.

762
01:13:14,141 --> 01:13:16,075
Come here.

763
01:13:19,780 --> 01:13:22,374
I'm sorry. This is not
gonna take very long, okay?

764
01:13:22,449 --> 01:13:26,078
All right. You go ahead.
You go get yourself a fuckin' sodie.

765
01:13:29,924 --> 01:13:31,619
Not bad, huh?

766
01:13:31,692 --> 01:13:34,490
You want a fuckin' sodie too?

767
01:13:34,562 --> 01:13:37,759
- I'm cool.
- Yes.

768
01:13:39,033 --> 01:13:41,627
Yes, you are.

769
01:13:42,536 --> 01:13:44,868
You are cool, aren't you?

770
01:13:48,342 --> 01:13:50,276
So?

771
01:13:51,178 --> 01:13:54,978
You're movin' a lot of shit.
Billy thought you might need some help.

772
01:13:58,786 --> 01:14:01,949
Sweet little Billy.
But nice to know he cares.

773
01:14:09,063 --> 01:14:10,997
Okay, now.

774
01:14:11,065 --> 01:14:13,158
If I'm out of line here,
you just let me know, okay?

775
01:14:13,233 --> 01:14:15,758
Or storm off or do whatever.

776
01:14:17,638 --> 01:14:19,572
I got us a room.

777
01:14:24,812 --> 01:14:26,973
Right on.

778
01:14:30,451 --> 01:14:32,442
- Could I borrow the phone?
- Sure.

779
01:14:32,519 --> 01:14:35,215
Just dial nine to get out.

780
01:14:42,630 --> 01:14:45,310
- Leave a message after the beep.
- Hey, Linc, you didn't say our...

781
01:14:47,434 --> 01:14:51,200
- You have no messages.
- Thank you.

782
01:15:10,791 --> 01:15:12,588
Wanna dance?

783
01:15:12,660 --> 01:15:15,390
What?

784
01:15:16,463 --> 01:15:17,725
Come on.

785
01:15:17,798 --> 01:15:19,732
Dance with me.

786
01:15:22,536 --> 01:15:24,470
I love this song.

787
01:15:25,973 --> 01:15:28,237
Come on.
It's just a little dance.

788
01:15:28,308 --> 01:15:30,970
I'm not a fag.
I just like to dance.

789
01:15:31,045 --> 01:15:35,141
Uh, you lead.
I'll be the girl. Yeah.

790
01:15:46,226 --> 01:15:49,161
I should get goin', man.
I got some business to handle.

791
01:15:49,229 --> 01:15:51,959
You're a classy dancer,
you know that?

792
01:15:53,500 --> 01:15:55,331
Oh, I'm sorry. Wait a minute.

793
01:15:55,402 --> 01:15:57,336
I forgot. What's your name?

794
01:16:01,275 --> 01:16:03,334
Spin me, Linc.

795
01:16:03,410 --> 01:16:05,241
What?

796
01:16:05,312 --> 01:16:07,974
I said spin me.

797
01:16:17,891 --> 01:16:19,825
We could enter a contest.

798
01:16:22,429 --> 01:16:25,455
You can ride with us
in the morning, okay?

799
01:16:25,532 --> 01:16:27,466
Come on.

800
01:16:55,863 --> 01:16:58,331
Okay, I got it.
Agua Dulce Airport.

801
01:16:58,398 --> 01:17:00,730
Yeah. Don't worry about it.
Bob, she's fine.

802
01:17:00,801 --> 01:17:03,065
She doesn't know a thing.
Don't worry about it.

803
01:17:05,472 --> 01:17:07,406
You fuckin' woke her up, man.

804
01:18:03,964 --> 01:18:06,228
I didn't do him, okay?

805
01:18:13,707 --> 01:18:15,641
What about Linc?

806
01:18:17,578 --> 01:18:19,705
Oh, he didn't leave a message.

807
01:18:21,748 --> 01:18:23,773
We gotta go.

808
01:18:23,851 --> 01:18:25,819
Are you sure about that?

809
01:18:25,886 --> 01:18:28,354
I overheard him say that
on the phone in the bathroom.

810
01:18:28,422 --> 01:18:32,119
And that piece of paper I found
in his pants said Aqua Dulce Airport.

811
01:18:32,192 --> 01:18:34,820
Jesus. Dirty cops,
drops at the airport.

812
01:18:34,895 --> 01:18:37,921
I feel like one of us should say
we're gettin' too old for this shit.

813
01:18:37,998 --> 01:18:40,865
At least it's not goin' down
in an abandoned warehouse.

814
01:18:43,804 --> 01:18:45,738
Yeah.

815
01:18:57,985 --> 01:19:00,749
You gotta hear these guys.
They can really rock, man.

816
01:19:00,821 --> 01:19:02,982
I mean, this band
can rock and roll.

817
01:19:03,056 --> 01:19:04,990
These boys are the bomb.

818
01:19:31,285 --> 01:19:33,583
All right.
I'm gonna go make a phone call.

819
01:19:33,654 --> 01:19:35,884
- What?
- Just stay here, all right?

820
01:19:42,829 --> 01:19:45,263
Let's go greet the fuckin' kids.

821
01:19:49,736 --> 01:19:52,569
Be nice to the boys, okay?

822
01:19:55,909 --> 01:20:00,175
- Hey! Kevin, how are you, baby?
- Howie!

823
01:20:00,247 --> 01:20:03,512
Hey, Kirk! Kris, how you doin', babe?
How are you?

824
01:20:03,583 --> 01:20:06,484
Oh, come on! Will ya pl...

825
01:20:06,553 --> 01:20:11,855
Hey, will you turn down the tunes
a scootch, please? Thanks. Listen, boys.

826
01:20:13,293 --> 01:20:15,227
Big people got some biz here.

827
01:20:15,295 --> 01:20:17,661
So why don't you hop into the limo...

828
01:20:17,731 --> 01:20:20,199
scoot over to the hotel,
we'll catch up with you later.

829
01:20:20,267 --> 01:20:23,964
- Come on. Can't we stay with you?
- Come on. Be good, boys.

830
01:20:24,037 --> 01:20:26,471
- We won't do anything.
- Give us a hug. Come on.

831
01:20:29,242 --> 01:20:32,336
- Go ahead. Go!
- Bye!

832
01:20:32,412 --> 01:20:33,845
See you at the hotel.

833
01:20:33,914 --> 01:20:36,542
- Don't be long.
- We missed you.

834
01:21:11,151 --> 01:21:13,085
Where the hell is that schmuck?

835
01:21:14,888 --> 01:21:17,914
Where'd you go?

836
01:21:17,991 --> 01:21:20,425
I called for backup.

837
01:21:20,494 --> 01:21:22,223
- What's goin' on?
- Linc's inside.

838
01:21:25,832 --> 01:21:28,926
God, that almost is
an abandoned warehouse.

839
01:21:29,002 --> 01:21:31,436
I'm gettin' too old for this shit.

840
01:21:58,165 --> 01:22:01,623
- Oh, my God.
- Shit.

841
01:22:01,701 --> 01:22:04,602
Oh, God. Okay.

842
01:22:09,042 --> 01:22:11,977
- Hey, you guys got a bathroom in here?
- Over there.

843
01:22:28,995 --> 01:22:31,828
- You're late.
- Sorry. I had to rent a car, man.

844
01:22:31,898 --> 01:22:34,298
Someone stole mine
from your party the other night.

845
01:22:34,367 --> 01:22:37,393
What do we do?

846
01:22:39,172 --> 01:22:40,867
- Let's go.
- What? Where?

847
01:22:40,941 --> 01:22:43,273
Get the car. Come on. Let's go.

848
01:22:48,448 --> 01:22:51,508
- Oh, God.
- You want me to drive?

849
01:22:51,585 --> 01:22:53,985
No. Linc wouldn't want you
driving his car.

850
01:22:59,159 --> 01:23:02,026
So, do we do this now...

851
01:23:02,095 --> 01:23:04,825
or do we wait for your boyfriend
to come out of the toilet?

852
01:23:06,199 --> 01:23:07,757
What?

853
01:23:09,703 --> 01:23:13,969
Your fella. He's a good dancer.

854
01:23:14,040 --> 01:23:19,205
Dancer? I don't know no dancer.
Are you serious?

855
01:23:22,215 --> 01:23:24,877
I don't know what the fuck
you're talkin' about.

856
01:23:24,951 --> 01:23:29,285
Uh-huh. No, brother's not with me.

857
01:23:30,357 --> 01:23:32,723
- He's a cop.
- What?

858
01:23:35,095 --> 01:23:38,064
- Stop messin' around.
- You'll know when I am. He's a cop!

859
01:23:38,131 --> 01:23:39,792
- Police!
- Freeze!

860
01:23:39,866 --> 01:23:42,391
- Drop the weapons!
- Drop 'em!

861
01:23:42,469 --> 01:23:44,403
- Right now! Drop 'em!
- Put 'em down!

862
01:23:44,471 --> 01:23:46,132
Down!

863
01:23:46,206 --> 01:23:47,639
Drop 'em! Get 'em out of here!

864
01:23:47,707 --> 01:23:50,642
- Come on, big man.
- Hey, this is fucked up.

865
01:23:50,710 --> 01:23:52,974
Faster.

866
01:23:56,082 --> 01:23:57,709
Teamwork.

867
01:23:57,784 --> 01:24:01,811
Let's go. Get out of here.
You too, home skillet.

868
01:24:01,888 --> 01:24:03,913
On the wall.

869
01:24:06,359 --> 01:24:07,986
Spread 'em!

870
01:24:11,831 --> 01:24:13,765
You dead, boy.

871
01:24:22,175 --> 01:24:23,836
Stop!

872
01:24:23,910 --> 01:24:25,400
Is that Eckford?

873
01:24:25,478 --> 01:24:28,242
- He better move.
- Right on.

874
01:24:34,854 --> 01:24:36,287
- Jump!
- What?

875
01:24:36,356 --> 01:24:38,483
Jump!

876
01:24:38,558 --> 01:24:41,925
- Oh, my God! My ankle!
- Get away from the door!

877
01:25:19,432 --> 01:25:22,526
Hey, kid, I don't think
you're gonna make it.

878
01:25:33,146 --> 01:25:35,580
- Fuck this fair fighting shit.
- Okay.

879
01:26:11,484 --> 01:26:13,076
- You okay?
- Yeah, man.

880
01:26:13,153 --> 01:26:14,620
Gotta go.

881
01:26:14,688 --> 01:26:16,383
I got a plan.

882
01:26:32,772 --> 01:26:34,706
Does this mean
you're mad at me again?

883
01:26:40,980 --> 01:26:42,413
You gonna kill him?

884
01:26:44,317 --> 01:26:45,750
No, I'm done.

885
01:26:56,663 --> 01:26:58,790
Hey, what are you doing, huh?

886
01:26:58,865 --> 01:27:00,976
I've got nothing to do with drugs.
I'm in the music business!

887
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:05,198
Hey, get this place taped off. You're
standing around like crossing guards.

888
01:27:14,781 --> 01:27:18,808
- Save me a dance, lover.
- What happened, Detective?

889
01:27:18,885 --> 01:27:23,379
Well, sir. We were bustin' 'em, and
these kids came in and tried to stop us.

890
01:27:23,456 --> 01:27:25,447
- That's bullshit.
- They tried to stop you?

891
01:27:25,525 --> 01:27:27,857
Yes, sir. Probably in on it too.

892
01:27:27,927 --> 01:27:31,124
- They set this up.
- They stole drugs from the evidence.

893
01:27:31,197 --> 01:27:34,462
- That's enough. Get 'em out of here.
- They killed Greer. He was onto them.

894
01:27:34,534 --> 01:27:35,865
Ask him.

895
01:27:37,837 --> 01:27:40,362
I have no idea
what she's talking about.

896
01:27:40,440 --> 01:27:41,600
Ask him.

897
01:27:46,179 --> 01:27:51,708
Right before Billy hands over the cash,
we roll in and make the bust, okay?

898
01:27:51,785 --> 01:27:56,188
- Where are we gonna get that money?
- Carl, there is no money, okay?

899
01:27:56,256 --> 01:27:59,817
It's an empty bag.
We bust in before Billy hands it over.

900
01:27:59,893 --> 01:28:02,088
Anybody have any questions?
It's all pretty easy.

901
01:28:02,162 --> 01:28:04,756
We grab the drugs,
pretend to arrest Billy...

902
01:28:04,831 --> 01:28:08,198
next day he's out moving
the stuff for us, okay?

903
01:28:10,570 --> 01:28:12,595
Yeah, Bob!

904
01:28:17,343 --> 01:28:19,834
Assume the position.

905
01:28:22,415 --> 01:28:24,349
Assume it.

906
01:28:30,723 --> 01:28:32,657
You all right?

907
01:28:33,726 --> 01:28:36,889
- Yeah, are you?
- Yeah.

908
01:28:36,963 --> 01:28:38,396
You?

909
01:28:40,633 --> 01:28:42,225
Yeah.

910
01:28:44,070 --> 01:28:46,538
Nice work.

911
01:28:46,606 --> 01:28:48,733
Thank you.

912
01:28:48,808 --> 01:28:51,276
So you kids are what...

913
01:28:51,344 --> 01:28:53,869
some kind of "mod squad"
or something?

914
01:29:05,758 --> 01:29:08,989
They say we're back on
if we want.

915
01:29:09,062 --> 01:29:12,691
- Yes.
- Won't be the same without Greer.

916
01:29:16,736 --> 01:29:18,670
What else we got?

917
01:29:23,076 --> 01:29:26,341
- So what? Are we in or...
- Right on.

918
01:29:27,981 --> 01:29:29,414
Solid.

919
01:29:33,353 --> 01:29:36,220
Oh, Linc, dude.
I know a guy down in Torrance...

920
01:29:36,289 --> 01:29:39,315
who is, like, the straight up wizard
of bondo.

921
01:29:39,392 --> 01:29:41,724
- And I'm sure he could fix up the car...
- Shut up, Pete.

922
01:29:41,794 --> 01:29:44,888
No, wait. I'm serious, dude.
No, this guy's like a bondo king.

923
01:29:44,964 --> 01:29:48,229
I'm sure he can slap that Lincoln
together in no time, right?

924
01:29:48,301 --> 01:29:50,861
You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna call my lawyer friend...

925
01:29:50,937 --> 01:29:55,806
to file a lawsuit against those guys
or the city or somebody, right?
