1
00:00:44,197 --> 00:00:44,959
Sit down, dear

2
00:00:49,369 --> 00:00:50,859
This one is Swiss by nationality

3
00:00:51,371 --> 00:00:53,635
Two years employment here in London
as a governess

4
00:00:54,875 --> 00:00:56,604
Pian. Drawing.

5
00:00:56,710 --> 00:00:58,234
French, of course

6
00:01:00,614 --> 00:01:01,603
How old are you, dear?

7
00:01:02,649 --> 00:01:03,240
Twentytwo

8
00:01:03,817 --> 00:01:04,715
Are you in good health?

9
00:01:05,218 --> 00:01:05,684
Yes

10
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,381
Are you parents still living?

11
00:01:08,889 --> 00:01:09,787
My mother is dead

12
00:01:10,524 --> 00:01:11,957
What was the cause of death?

13
00:01:12,893 --> 00:01:13,951
She died in childbirth

14
00:01:16,263 --> 00:01:17,321
Ask her to stand up

15
00:01:18,198 --> 00:01:18,960
Stand up, dear

16
00:01:22,936 --> 00:01:23,834
Turn around

17
00:01:26,406 --> 00:01:27,236
All the way

18
00:01:32,713 --> 00:01:34,408
Ask her what the money is for

19
00:01:35,382 --> 00:01:37,475
The father is in debt, it seems.

20
00:01:38,285 --> 00:01:40,310
Does she have any other way of making money?

21
00:01:41,989 --> 00:01:42,717
Sit down, dear.

22
00:01:46,493 --> 00:01:47,585
The gentleman asks

23
00:01:47,694 --> 00:01:49,855
Have you no other way to raise money?

24
00:01:49,997 --> 00:01:51,658
Does the gentleman have a suggestion?

25
00:01:52,566 --> 00:01:55,057
Your're very pretty. You could marry

26
00:01:55,602 --> 00:01:58,093
I could sell mylife for life

27
00:01:58,505 --> 00:02:01,338
The gentleman's needs,
I believe, are of shorter duration

28
00:02:04,778 --> 00:02:05,972
Has she done this before?

29
00:02:07,381 --> 00:02:08,177
The gentleman asks...

30
00:02:08,348 --> 00:02:10,316
Can the gentleman not ask himself?

31
00:02:12,085 --> 00:02:13,484
Your're not to know who he is, my dear

32
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:15,151
No one is

33
00:02:15,622 --> 00:02:17,317
He need not tell me his name

34
00:02:18,158 --> 00:02:19,750
I'd like to hear his voice

35
00:02:24,898 --> 00:02:26,729
What can you tell from a voice?

36
00:02:29,803 --> 00:02:30,701
A little

37
00:02:32,339 --> 00:02:34,603
Have you ever done anything like this before?

38
00:02:35,976 --> 00:02:37,409
No, never

39
00:02:42,749 --> 00:02:43,773
Will you do it?

40
00:02:46,887 --> 00:02:47,615
Of course

41
00:02:48,188 --> 00:02:49,712
Why else am I here?

42
00:02:50,757 --> 00:02:52,384
Shall I look further?

43
00:02:55,328 --> 00:02:56,955
No, this is the one

44
00:04:32,593 --> 00:04:33,924
Anything else, sir?

45
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:48,768
I did't want to be seen
entering the room with you

46
00:05:56,444 --> 00:05:58,207
I can't introduce myself, as you know

47
00:06:00,348 --> 00:06:01,645
Did you have a smooth crossing?

48
00:06:02,516 --> 00:06:03,448
For the most part

49
00:06:03,951 --> 00:06:05,179
Do you like the hotel?

50
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:06,818
I have no complaints

51
00:06:07,488 --> 00:06:08,614
Please

52
00:06:12,393 --> 00:06:13,826
It is of utmost importance

53
00:06:13,928 --> 00:06:16,692
that we're not seen together in public

54
00:06:20,201 --> 00:06:21,566
I have a reputation to protect

55
00:06:21,836 --> 00:06:24,066
Not just for myself, but for others

56
00:06:34,482 --> 00:06:35,380
Do you understand?

57
00:06:38,352 --> 00:06:41,344
We'll meet each evening
after dinner in your room

58
00:06:42,123 --> 00:06:42,885
As you wish

59
00:06:44,992 --> 00:06:46,391
Are we to...

60
00:06:49,664 --> 00:06:51,359
To meet this evening?

61
00:06:51,899 --> 00:06:55,062
Yes. We only have three evenings

62
00:06:57,772 --> 00:06:58,932
When are we to begin?

63
00:07:01,876 --> 00:07:04,276
I thought you might
need time to accustom yourself

64
00:07:05,112 --> 00:07:06,238
I have accustomed myself

65
00:07:07,915 --> 00:07:08,882
I'm ready now

66
00:07:28,636 --> 00:07:30,103
The fire gives more light than one expects

67
00:07:31,739 --> 00:07:32,967
Does it bother you?

68
00:07:34,608 --> 00:07:35,199
No

69
00:09:01,595 --> 00:09:02,960
Will this do?

70
00:09:07,368 --> 00:09:07,834
Yes

71
00:10:26,948 --> 00:10:28,813
You may think I'm no better than him

72
00:10:32,954 --> 00:10:34,080
I think nothing

73
00:10:36,024 --> 00:10:37,514
Is what we're doing wrong?

74
00:10:44,599 --> 00:10:47,864
You, at least...

75
00:10:47,969 --> 00:10:50,267
Are doing it for someone else

76
00:10:52,607 --> 00:10:54,973
I, too, have a duty to someone else

77
00:10:56,945 --> 00:11:00,904
Then, sir, since neither of us are here
for our own pleasure

78
00:11:01,249 --> 00:11:03,274
Perhaps what we do isn't so wrong

79
00:11:43,592 --> 00:11:45,219
I don't want to know your name

80
00:11:45,827 --> 00:11:47,727
Or anything about you

81
00:12:12,454 --> 00:12:14,251
Aren't you afraid to be seen with me?

82
00:12:15,624 --> 00:12:16,886
There's no one to see

83
00:12:18,793 --> 00:12:20,055
I like it here

84
00:12:20,962 --> 00:12:22,554
Just sea and sky and...

85
00:12:23,798 --> 00:12:25,356
And nothing

86
00:12:27,569 --> 00:12:28,593
I like it

87
00:12:29,738 --> 00:12:31,296
Makes me want to shout

88
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:32,798
Then shout

89
00:12:53,795 --> 00:12:55,023
It's not son easy

90
00:13:03,872 --> 00:13:05,066
Your're very...

91
00:13:10,311 --> 00:13:11,903
I don't expect it to be like this

92
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:17,078
What did you expect?

93
00:13:21,823 --> 00:13:22,721
Last night...

94
00:13:26,561 --> 00:13:27,118
...I thought...

95
00:13:31,766 --> 00:13:33,256
For a moment I thought that...

96
00:13:36,037 --> 00:13:37,527
You thought I like it?

97
00:13:41,776 --> 00:13:42,640
Did you?

98
00:13:44,646 --> 00:13:45,408
No

99
00:13:53,388 --> 00:13:54,650
But I could

100
00:14:22,584 --> 00:14:23,744
I wish...

101
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:26,844
What do you wish?

102
00:14:28,089 --> 00:14:31,252
I wish I could shout

103
00:15:08,062 --> 00:15:10,257
Mrs. Jago will see to everything
when the time comes

104
00:15:11,633 --> 00:15:12,531
Yes, I know

105
00:15:14,335 --> 00:15:16,633
We made an arrangement. I accept it

106
00:15:19,974 --> 00:15:22,636
You won't want to be seen
disembarking in my company

107
00:15:23,211 --> 00:15:23,734
No

108
00:15:29,651 --> 00:15:30,743
Goodbye, then

109
00:16:12,761 --> 00:16:13,853
Very soon, my dear

110
00:16:38,988 --> 00:16:39,955
It's a girl

111
00:16:41,056 --> 00:16:41,715
Is she all there?

112
00:16:41,891 --> 00:16:44,189
Oh, yes. She's beautiful

113
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:45,791
Better take her away at once

114
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,462
There, my pet. All over now

115
00:17:30,472 --> 00:17:34,101
For my English Daughter

116
00:17:54,797 --> 00:17:56,662
First birthday, darling

117
00:17:56,832 --> 00:17:59,733
August 10th, 1839

118
00:18:03,372 --> 00:18:05,363
I don't even know your name

119
00:18:08,711 --> 00:18:11,612
Another New Year my Darling

120
00:18:13,382 --> 00:18:17,182
I don't forget, wherever you are

121
00:18:19,655 --> 00:18:22,783
Your Fourth Birthday. You must be so big

122
00:18:25,995 --> 00:18:30,694
Six years today. When will I ever find you?

123
00:18:32,434 --> 00:18:33,799
Happy birthday, darling

124
00:18:39,108 --> 00:18:41,235
I don't forget you

125
00:18:43,579 --> 00:18:44,375
Ready?

126
00:18:44,713 --> 00:18:49,082
Madames, give me your bodies, give me your souls

127
00:18:56,091 --> 00:19:00,755
Make a window with your legs

128
00:19:03,198 --> 00:19:04,927
Move from the waist

129
00:19:06,435 --> 00:19:08,596
Ladies, trust your gentleman

130
00:19:09,038 --> 00:19:12,132
In the polka, faith is the virtue that saves

131
00:19:13,175 --> 00:19:15,405
Shame on you, Mr. Godwin. Not dancing?

132
00:19:16,145 --> 00:19:17,442
I'm afraid I don't know the steps, Mrs. Hurst

133
00:19:17,579 --> 00:19:18,705
None of us know the steps

134
00:19:18,947 --> 00:19:22,348
that's the fun of it we learn together.

135
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,014
As you seem

136
00:19:26,121 --> 00:19:27,486
I'm also not dressed for dancing

137
00:19:28,924 --> 00:19:30,186
Jenny, I want you

138
00:19:30,826 --> 00:19:31,520
I shall have you

139
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:38,833
Seen enough?

140
00:19:39,635 --> 00:19:41,262
You must admit, it's quite a sight

141
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:42,937
Quite a cost, too

142
00:19:46,608 --> 00:19:47,870
There's the monster

143
00:19:50,446 --> 00:19:51,344
Do you want to meet him?

144
00:19:53,048 --> 00:19:53,571
Surely

145
00:19:54,216 --> 00:19:56,411
The lady with him isn't exactly his wife

146
00:19:57,653 --> 00:19:59,052
You don't exactly surprise me

147
00:20:00,022 --> 00:20:01,683
The latest in long line

148
00:20:07,262 --> 00:20:07,660
Father,

149
00:20:07,896 --> 00:20:08,555
This is I'd like to introduce you to

150
00:20:08,797 --> 00:20:11,095
You're not dressed, Charles. Go get dressed

151
00:20:11,533 --> 00:20:12,056
Father

152
00:20:12,201 --> 00:20:12,895
You're a blot, boy

153
00:20:14,103 --> 00:20:15,035
Father, may I introduce you

154
00:20:15,137 --> 00:20:17,196
To Mr. John Taylor of Ohio

155
00:20:18,273 --> 00:20:19,604
My father, Lord Clare

156
00:20:20,876 --> 00:20:21,638
Miss Holland

157
00:20:22,811 --> 00:20:25,974
What brings you all the way from Ohio, sir?

158
00:20:28,717 --> 00:20:30,412
Your son and I hope to do business together

159
00:20:31,386 --> 00:20:31,943
What business?

160
00:20:32,955 --> 00:20:33,853
I'm a sheep farmer

161
00:20:35,624 --> 00:20:36,249
A sheep farmer

162
00:20:39,194 --> 00:20:40,593
Get dressed, Charles, or get out

163
00:20:40,729 --> 00:20:41,457
Be a good fellow

164
00:20:46,235 --> 00:20:47,759
I wouldn't have missed that for the world

165
00:20:50,405 --> 00:20:51,963
I wish I could laugh

166
00:20:52,574 --> 00:20:54,906
My father's London life must be paid for

167
00:20:55,410 --> 00:20:57,378
We don't live like this in the country

168
00:20:58,313 --> 00:20:59,371
The boy's not normal

169
00:20:59,615 --> 00:21:00,980
Don't ask me why

170
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:02,615
Don't be hard on him, Jimmy

171
00:21:03,819 --> 00:21:05,548
When you think of his poor wife

172
00:21:06,522 --> 00:21:08,353
Damn it, Molly, that was 10 years ago

173
00:21:08,824 --> 00:21:10,792
You'd think he'd find female comfort

174
00:21:10,926 --> 00:21:12,223
But he won't

175
00:21:13,328 --> 00:21:14,090
Are you sure?

176
00:21:14,263 --> 00:21:15,855
Quite. The boy's not normal

177
00:21:17,266 --> 00:21:19,325
I brought his fellow over from Paris

178
00:21:20,068 --> 00:21:22,366
First polka in London

179
00:21:22,671 --> 00:21:24,468
Come on, Molly. Let's hop

180
00:22:26,569 --> 00:22:28,400
You'd be the new govemess

181
00:22:30,206 --> 00:22:32,231
Do you know about the child, miss?

182
00:22:33,009 --> 00:22:33,998
I know what I've been told

183
00:22:34,944 --> 00:22:37,777
She was left in a basket
on the steps of the Ram Inn

184
00:22:38,047 --> 00:22:39,275
They tell you that?

185
00:22:41,050 --> 00:22:41,846
No

186
00:22:42,151 --> 00:22:45,609
No, they don't tell them that

187
00:22:46,522 --> 00:22:48,990
Could you possibly put something on the fire?

188
00:22:49,559 --> 00:22:51,686
I can't bend, miss

189
00:22:51,861 --> 00:22:53,488
My wig falls off

190
00:23:04,073 --> 00:23:05,370
Please to come with me, miss

191
00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:09,173
You'll be the fourth this year

192
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:10,907
The fourth govemess?

193
00:23:11,347 --> 00:23:12,405
The don't stay

194
00:23:13,116 --> 00:23:14,913
Miss Louisa sees to that

195
00:23:15,618 --> 00:23:16,414
Louisa

196
00:23:19,789 --> 00:23:20,915
Govemess's rrom

197
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,594
Thomas will bring your trunk up,
when he has time

198
00:23:27,764 --> 00:23:29,459
Twentyfive pounds a year you're paid

199
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,331
Cook gets thirty

200
00:23:34,304 --> 00:23:35,236
Schoolroom's this way

201
00:23:37,006 --> 00:23:39,270
We don't get many like you here

202
00:23:39,676 --> 00:23:40,199
Like what?

203
00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:40,967
Foreigners, miss

204
00:23:41,978 --> 00:23:43,138
We're all English here

205
00:23:45,148 --> 00:23:46,115
Schoolroom

206
00:23:51,921 --> 00:23:53,821
Know about Miss Louisa, miss?

207
00:23:54,057 --> 00:23:56,457
She was left in a basket at the Ram Inn

208
00:23:56,626 --> 00:23:57,490
Don't beliebve it

209
00:23:57,994 --> 00:24:00,394
The master bought her froma gypsy

210
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:04,232
She thinks she's the little lady,

211
00:24:04,334 --> 00:24:05,596
But she don't fool me

212
00:24:07,804 --> 00:24:08,600
Where is she now?

213
00:24:09,706 --> 00:24:10,502
I don't know

214
00:24:11,274 --> 00:24:13,242
Maybe the gypsies took her back

215
00:24:19,916 --> 00:24:20,439
Excuse me

216
00:24:20,883 --> 00:24:22,578
Where would I find Miss Louisa?

217
00:24:22,752 --> 00:24:23,878
She'll be in her lake house

218
00:24:24,754 --> 00:24:26,153
She always hides there

219
00:26:34,083 --> 00:26:35,050
Who are you?

220
00:26:38,588 --> 00:26:41,216
Miss Laurier. Your new govemess

221
00:26:49,632 --> 00:26:51,065
You're not English, are you?

222
00:26:54,837 --> 00:26:56,304
Do you speak English?

223
00:27:06,716 --> 00:27:07,910
Then bugger away, lady

224
00:27:18,461 --> 00:27:20,861
I see you found your way to Lquisa's lake house

225
00:27:22,598 --> 00:27:24,294
And she ran away from you, I suppose

226
00:27:27,404 --> 00:27:28,393
That's what she does

227
00:27:29,473 --> 00:27:30,838
I'm afraid her father

228
00:27:30,941 --> 00:27:33,774
Isn't very strict with her, as you'll discover

229
00:27:34,478 --> 00:27:36,639
Mr. Godwin is not at home?

230
00:27:37,681 --> 00:27:38,670
He's in town

231
00:27:38,916 --> 00:27:40,076
We expect him back tomorrow

232
00:27:40,918 --> 00:27:41,680
Mrs. Godwin

233
00:27:41,818 --> 00:27:42,682
Oh, no

234
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:48,180
No, I'm not Mrs. Godwin

235
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:52,628
My sister, Amelia, married Charles

236
00:27:53,263 --> 00:27:54,753
So she is Mrs. Godwin

237
00:27:56,333 --> 00:27:57,561
Soon after her marriage

238
00:27:57,868 --> 00:27:59,301
She had a serious accident, a riding accident

239
00:27:59,536 --> 00:28:02,664
Charles had no one to run the house

240
00:28:03,473 --> 00:28:04,269
So I came.

241
00:28:08,845 --> 00:28:10,836
And, um, Mrs. Godwin

242
00:28:13,884 --> 00:28:15,181
Amy didn't dei

243
00:28:16,987 --> 00:28:18,750
Her life is over, but she lives on

244
00:28:21,758 --> 00:28:23,350
And here we are

245
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:24,893
Charles and I...

246
00:28:25,729 --> 00:28:27,196
...and Amy and Louisa

247
00:29:17,881 --> 00:29:18,677
We're home

248
00:29:39,870 --> 00:29:41,667
There was no need to walk down, John

249
00:29:42,372 --> 00:29:43,498
I'm not an old man yet

250
00:29:44,174 --> 00:29:45,573
Ellen, take Louisa's cloak

251
00:29:47,644 --> 00:29:49,134
This is the man you must meet

252
00:29:49,312 --> 00:29:50,711
Mr Ames is my farm manager

253
00:30:03,694 --> 00:30:05,628
Have any experience of Southdowns

254
00:30:05,896 --> 00:30:08,091
No. We run Merinos

255
00:30:08,231 --> 00:30:10,791
There's no hardier breed than the Southdowns

256
00:30:11,234 --> 00:30:12,360
We have a new govemess

257
00:30:12,936 --> 00:30:13,630
Another one?

258
00:30:14,204 --> 00:30:15,603
Send Miss Laurier to meet the master

259
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,236
Thomas, come with me

260
00:30:18,108 --> 00:30:18,870
Look at this girl

261
00:30:19,810 --> 00:30:20,799
Is she so frightening?

262
00:30:21,311 --> 00:30:23,472
Govemesses run from her, squealing

263
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:25,147
How do you do that, Louisa?

264
00:30:28,585 --> 00:30:29,916
I don't want a govemess

265
00:30:30,153 --> 00:30:31,142
I don't want a govemess

266
00:30:32,222 --> 00:30:32,916
Did you miss me?

267
00:30:33,223 --> 00:30:35,589
You must give me breeding tips

268
00:30:35,826 --> 00:30:37,020
I mean to win prizes

269
00:30:37,661 --> 00:30:39,322
Mr Godwin's your man

270
00:30:39,763 --> 00:30:40,695
He's our master breeder

271
00:30:41,531 --> 00:30:42,691
Be careful, John

272
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:44,490
Breeding can become something of an obession

273
00:30:44,601 --> 00:30:48,298
It's nothing less than
the endless pursuit of perfection

274
00:30:51,308 --> 00:30:52,332
How close have you gotten?

275
00:30:53,677 --> 00:30:55,008
To perfection, I mean

276
00:30:55,712 --> 00:30:57,942
The Selcombe flock
is as good as you'll find, sir

277
00:30:59,316 --> 00:30:59,782
That's what I hear

278
00:31:01,384 --> 00:31:02,510
What is your secret?

279
00:31:03,587 --> 00:31:05,851
Here's the new govemess

280
00:31:07,557 --> 00:31:09,149
This is my brotherinlaw, Mr. Godwin

281
00:31:09,926 --> 00:31:10,415
Miss Laurier

282
00:31:16,266 --> 00:31:17,460
Miss Laurier's from Switzerland

283
00:31:18,101 --> 00:31:19,728
...but she'w worked in England for years

284
00:31:23,173 --> 00:31:23,696
I see

285
00:31:30,747 --> 00:31:32,408
I'm sure Mr. Taylor needs a drink

286
00:31:32,949 --> 00:31:33,540
I know I do

287
00:31:45,829 --> 00:31:47,091
You must leave at once

288
00:31:47,497 --> 00:31:49,931
What on earth possessed you to come here?

289
00:31:50,867 --> 00:31:52,334
It took 7 years to find my child

290
00:31:52,469 --> 00:31:53,993
Don't make me leave here now

291
00:31:54,437 --> 00:31:55,165
We had an agreement

292
00:31:55,505 --> 00:31:57,029
You had your money

293
00:31:57,808 --> 00:31:59,901
I didn't know how hard it woule be

294
00:32:00,043 --> 00:32:01,237
I never forgot her cry

295
00:32:01,344 --> 00:32:02,868
You were paid to forget

296
00:32:03,013 --> 00:32:03,877
I tried

297
00:32:04,414 --> 00:32:05,142
You tried?

298
00:32:06,483 --> 00:32:08,041
I'd return the money if I could

299
00:32:08,185 --> 00:32:09,277
I don't want the money

300
00:32:09,419 --> 00:32:11,785
It wasn't for me

301
00:32:11,888 --> 00:32:12,912
It was for my father

302
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:13,818
He was in prison

303
00:32:13,924 --> 00:32:14,754
I don't want to hear this

304
00:32:16,126 --> 00:32:16,592
I just...

305
00:32:20,597 --> 00:32:22,292
I wanted an heir, a child

306
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:23,593
Is that so wrong?

307
00:32:23,967 --> 00:32:25,958
I swear no one will learn the truth

308
00:32:26,236 --> 00:32:27,168
Not even Louisa

309
00:32:27,270 --> 00:32:28,669
Not your own daughter?

310
00:32:28,772 --> 00:32:29,739
You couldn't live with that

311
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:31,370
I have no choice

312
00:32:31,842 --> 00:32:32,638
I have no home

313
00:32:32,843 --> 00:32:34,902
I must be govemess to her or nothing

314
00:32:35,011 --> 00:32:35,875
She hates govemesses

315
00:32:35,979 --> 00:32:37,708
She needs me. That's enough

316
00:32:38,882 --> 00:32:40,679
No, it's impossible, the whole thing

317
00:32:40,851 --> 00:32:42,318
You must go. That's it

318
00:32:51,695 --> 00:32:53,185
You must get another govemess

319
00:32:53,263 --> 00:32:54,321
Miss Laurier can't stay

320
00:32:55,665 --> 00:32:56,597
Why?

321
00:32:58,702 --> 00:32:59,498
Louisa doesn't like her

322
00:33:01,004 --> 00:33:03,268
Oh, Charles. Louisa doesn't like any govemess

323
00:33:06,209 --> 00:33:08,769
Can't a men choose who educates his daughter?

324
00:33:10,747 --> 00:33:12,408
Shall she be dismissed without a character?

325
00:33:12,782 --> 00:33:13,441
No

326
00:33:14,084 --> 00:33:15,711
Then she must be given a month's notice

327
00:33:17,287 --> 00:33:17,719
A month?

328
00:33:19,624 --> 00:33:20,488
Can't she just be paid?

329
00:33:21,492 --> 00:33:23,517
Govemess make their homes with employers

330
00:33:24,328 --> 00:33:26,421
She can't leave without a new situation

331
00:33:27,932 --> 00:33:28,489
A month?

332
00:33:30,401 --> 00:33:31,663
A month is an eternity

333
00:33:31,869 --> 00:33:33,336
Does she really have no home but this?

334
00:33:34,472 --> 00:33:36,269
That why govemesses are govemesses

335
00:33:36,374 --> 00:33:39,138
What happens to them
when they can't be govemesses

336
00:33:39,410 --> 00:33:40,399
I really don't know

337
00:33:44,515 --> 00:33:46,039
These huge rooms

338
00:33:46,217 --> 00:33:48,082
And we live within 3 feet of the fire

339
00:33:56,027 --> 00:33:56,789
Come with me, please

340
00:34:04,735 --> 00:34:06,032
Your're to have one month's notice

341
00:34:11,642 --> 00:34:13,041
You swore you'd tell no one

342
00:34:21,218 --> 00:34:22,082
Thank you, Hannah

343
00:34:23,921 --> 00:34:25,149
Have I time for tea, sir?

344
00:34:25,489 --> 00:34:27,116
Yes. I'll stay you return

345
00:34:32,830 --> 00:34:34,127
Amy, I've brought someone to see you

346
00:34:37,134 --> 00:34:38,032
This is Miss Laurier

347
00:34:38,135 --> 00:34:38,829
Please

348
00:34:45,810 --> 00:34:46,834
This is my wife, Amelia

349
00:34:48,713 --> 00:34:49,304
Mrs. Godwin

350
00:34:55,686 --> 00:34:57,347
I tell Amy everything

351
00:35:01,659 --> 00:35:03,286
She knows Louisa is my daughter

352
00:35:05,763 --> 00:35:08,231
But I promised her
I'd never shame her before the world

353
00:35:10,134 --> 00:35:11,658
No one else knows but you

354
00:35:14,171 --> 00:35:15,638
Does she understand us?

355
00:35:16,273 --> 00:35:18,002
I choose to believe she does

356
00:35:21,812 --> 00:35:25,009
If there's any pity
in you for my wife's wasted life...

357
00:35:26,917 --> 00:35:28,612
...swear you'll keep out secret

358
00:35:34,625 --> 00:35:35,182
I swear

359
00:35:44,135 --> 00:35:44,624
Now leave us

360
00:36:52,036 --> 00:36:53,060
Good morning, Louisa

361
00:37:07,551 --> 00:37:08,950
Do you know your ABC?

362
00:37:09,186 --> 00:37:10,710
Do you know your ABC?

363
00:37:19,930 --> 00:37:20,897
This is L...

364
00:37:21,165 --> 00:37:23,793
...for Louisa

365
00:37:25,102 --> 00:37:27,866
This is L for Louisa

366
00:37:29,907 --> 00:37:31,704
Don't go. We have work to do

367
00:37:33,177 --> 00:37:35,304
Don't go. We have work to do

368
00:37:40,885 --> 00:37:42,682
You're poor, I suppose?

369
00:37:44,221 --> 00:37:44,846
Yes

370
00:37:46,457 --> 00:37:47,981
I don't have to do what you say

371
00:38:00,404 --> 00:38:01,428
You hoist them off

372
00:38:03,073 --> 00:38:03,801
Bugger away, lady

373
00:38:05,075 --> 00:38:05,700
Gently

374
00:38:05,843 --> 00:38:07,208
You see why?

375
00:38:07,344 --> 00:38:08,470
No, I don't

376
00:38:08,879 --> 00:38:10,608
They all look good to me

377
00:38:10,781 --> 00:38:12,146
You have a superb flock

378
00:38:12,516 --> 00:38:13,175
I do

379
00:38:13,350 --> 00:38:15,409
I've breeding imperfections out for 15 years

380
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:18,718
This one is a perfect breeding ewe

381
00:38:18,889 --> 00:38:21,323
Chine runs straight from the nect to the tail

382
00:38:21,692 --> 00:38:23,182
Good, wide hips

383
00:38:23,561 --> 00:38:24,528
Straight forelegs

384
00:38:24,662 --> 00:38:25,754
Plenty of woolbetween the ears

385
00:38:25,896 --> 00:38:27,124
Look in her eyes

386
00:38:27,264 --> 00:38:28,754
A sweet, gentle disposition

387
00:38:28,933 --> 00:38:31,094
She'll feed well, fatten well and lamb well

388
00:38:31,535 --> 00:38:32,467
Good morning, Miss Laurier

389
00:38:34,104 --> 00:38:34,593
Mr. Taylor

390
00:38:35,139 --> 00:38:36,970
Have you come to admire the Southdowns, too?

391
00:38:38,776 --> 00:38:42,007
No, sir. I've come for Mr. Godwin's instructions

392
00:38:45,015 --> 00:38:45,777
Well?

393
00:38:46,317 --> 00:38:49,047
Am I to teach Miss Louisa,
if only for one month?

394
00:38:50,421 --> 00:38:50,887
Yes

395
00:38:51,755 --> 00:38:53,586
Then I must keep her in the schoolroom

396
00:38:54,191 --> 00:38:56,216
What forms of discipline may I use?

397
00:38:56,527 --> 00:38:57,221
None

398
00:38:57,428 --> 00:38:59,157
What should she endure lessons
she does not like?

399
00:39:04,468 --> 00:39:07,096
She'll learn soon enough how hard the world is

400
00:39:07,238 --> 00:39:09,672
For these few short years,
I want her to be happy

401
00:39:12,409 --> 00:39:12,807
Is that clear?

402
00:39:14,379 --> 00:39:15,004
Yes sir

403
00:39:19,451 --> 00:39:20,679
Fair enough?

404
00:39:26,725 --> 00:39:28,556
Turn around. Go on

405
00:39:30,395 --> 00:39:32,454
Let me out! I want Papa! Let me out!

406
00:39:32,897 --> 00:39:34,660
Somebody let me out

407
00:39:34,866 --> 00:39:37,164
I want Papa! I want Papa!

408
00:39:37,302 --> 00:39:38,701
Let me out! Now!

409
00:39:39,237 --> 00:39:40,033
I want Papa

410
00:39:40,305 --> 00:39:41,272
Let me out!

411
00:39:41,373 --> 00:39:43,273
After you've done your lessons

412
00:39:46,544 --> 00:39:47,169
Let me out!

413
00:39:47,345 --> 00:39:49,040
I want Papa! Let me out now!

414
00:39:49,281 --> 00:39:51,249
Hey! Let me out!

415
00:40:00,558 --> 00:40:01,183
What is that?

416
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:04,629
Miss Louisa, sir. Being educated

417
00:40:05,430 --> 00:40:06,328
I hate you!

418
00:40:12,037 --> 00:40:13,402
No, never! Never!

419
00:40:18,176 --> 00:40:18,574
Open the door

420
00:40:22,414 --> 00:40:23,711
Miss Laurier, open this door at once!

421
00:40:32,257 --> 00:40:33,383
What is this? Open the door

422
00:40:34,125 --> 00:40:34,853
No, sir

423
00:40:39,331 --> 00:40:41,822
Please, Papa! come in, please

424
00:40:42,467 --> 00:40:43,991
I won't have you treat here like this

425
00:40:45,637 --> 00:40:47,332
She'll grow up ignorant and friendless

426
00:40:47,472 --> 00:40:48,632
She's imprisioned!

427
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:49,864
She only cares for you

428
00:40:50,008 --> 00:40:51,236
So no one cares for her

429
00:40:51,476 --> 00:40:52,067
Give me the key

430
00:40:52,210 --> 00:40:53,575
She's unhappy and lonely

431
00:40:53,712 --> 00:40:55,407
She doesn't know who she is

432
00:41:09,427 --> 00:41:11,895
Papa, help me! Papa, I want you

433
00:41:13,031 --> 00:41:15,556
I can help her. I know I can

434
00:41:17,602 --> 00:41:19,399
But she must learn to obey me

435
00:41:22,774 --> 00:41:24,264
If you harm even one hair on her head

436
00:41:25,410 --> 00:41:27,605
Do you think I, of all people, would hurt her?

437
00:41:31,649 --> 00:41:32,809
I'll make you a promise

438
00:41:34,152 --> 00:41:36,450
Whatever I do to Louisa, I'll do to myself

439
00:41:40,425 --> 00:41:41,722
You want her to love you

440
00:41:42,861 --> 00:41:44,328
I want her to be loved

441
00:41:47,165 --> 00:41:49,633
She won't have you forever

442
00:42:05,784 --> 00:42:07,979
Louisa, I'll see you when lessons are over

443
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:09,884
All right, darling?

444
00:42:11,856 --> 00:42:13,915
I love you

445
00:42:32,177 --> 00:42:33,235
Lunch, miss

446
00:42:33,478 --> 00:42:34,809
Thank you, Ellen. Put it on the table

447
00:42:39,384 --> 00:42:40,612
Will that be all, miss?

448
00:42:41,152 --> 00:42:41,675
Thank you, Ellen

449
00:42:47,859 --> 00:42:48,723
Do you want your lunch?

450
00:43:04,209 --> 00:43:04,732
One

451
00:43:08,046 --> 00:43:08,671
Two

452
00:43:15,286 --> 00:43:17,618
If you won't eat, then neither will I

453
00:43:26,097 --> 00:43:27,462
I say you're lucky to have her

454
00:43:28,733 --> 00:43:29,392
Why?

455
00:43:29,934 --> 00:43:32,596
She has pride in herself. Doesn't back down

456
00:43:35,907 --> 00:43:36,737
And she's lovely

457
00:43:39,110 --> 00:43:40,372
You must have noticed

458
00:43:41,779 --> 00:43:43,269
Miss Laurier is here to teach Louisa

459
00:43:43,982 --> 00:43:45,108
She leaves in a month

460
00:43:46,551 --> 00:43:48,644
Then I may speak to her?

461
00:43:49,954 --> 00:43:51,387
What do you mean, "speak to her"?

462
00:43:51,990 --> 00:43:54,322
Well, she doesn't seem to have a home of her own

463
00:43:56,528 --> 00:43:57,358
You mean to employ her?

464
00:43:58,663 --> 00:43:59,755
Not exactly

465
00:44:00,932 --> 00:44:02,331
I was thinking of marriage

466
00:44:03,368 --> 00:44:03,857
Marriage?

467
00:44:07,572 --> 00:44:08,903
I could do a lot worse

468
00:44:12,176 --> 00:44:13,234
I leave tomorrow

469
00:44:14,379 --> 00:44:15,311
I don't have much time

470
00:44:16,814 --> 00:44:18,213
Youd'd better ask her, then

471
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:22,648
I'm cold

472
00:44:24,122 --> 00:44:24,747
So am I

473
00:44:25,023 --> 00:44:25,751
I hate you

474
00:44:26,524 --> 00:44:29,254
Hate me if you want, but you must obey me

475
00:44:29,894 --> 00:44:31,691
I won't. I'd die first

476
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:33,427
How will you die?

477
00:44:34,966 --> 00:44:36,365
I'll drown myself in the lake

478
00:44:37,235 --> 00:44:38,964
How will your body stay underwater?

479
00:44:40,004 --> 00:44:41,028
It just will

480
00:44:41,973 --> 00:44:44,134
No, it won't. Bodies float

481
00:44:45,543 --> 00:44:47,511
You could put stones in your pockets

482
00:44:47,845 --> 00:44:49,005
Don't talk to me

483
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:52,005
Or you could fill a bag with pebbles

484
00:44:52,216 --> 00:44:53,706
I said, don't talk to me

485
00:44:53,985 --> 00:44:55,043
What do you do in the lake house?

486
00:44:59,057 --> 00:45:01,617
If you come near it, I'll murder you

487
00:45:01,859 --> 00:45:02,587
How?

488
00:45:02,694 --> 00:45:05,094
I'll stab you in the heart with a knife

489
00:45:05,430 --> 00:45:06,362
That would do it

490
00:45:07,031 --> 00:45:08,328
It would. You'd be dead

491
00:45:09,468 --> 00:45:10,332
You'd have to bury me

492
00:45:10,703 --> 00:45:12,193
No. I'd just leave you

493
00:45:12,738 --> 00:45:14,171
I'd rot. I'd smell

494
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:14,997
Serves you right

495
00:45:23,882 --> 00:45:26,146
What are these stupid lessons, anyway?

496
00:45:28,621 --> 00:45:29,349
"Louisa...

497
00:45:30,923 --> 00:45:31,480
"...Ioves...

498
00:45:32,891 --> 00:45:33,414
"...Papa."

499
00:45:35,461 --> 00:45:36,189
"Louisa...

500
00:45:37,129 --> 00:45:37,686
"...Ioves...

501
00:45:38,831 --> 00:45:39,490
"...grass."

502
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:41,859
"Louisa...

503
00:45:45,137 --> 00:45:45,831
...eats

504
00:45:46,538 --> 00:45:47,197
...grass

505
00:45:50,776 --> 00:45:53,142
Sheep eat grass

506
00:46:13,399 --> 00:46:15,094
Papa loves sheep

507
00:46:17,036 --> 00:46:18,663
You see? It's not that hard

508
00:46:24,009 --> 00:46:25,533
Do you know about firelight?

509
00:46:26,378 --> 00:46:27,367
What about it?

510
00:46:29,114 --> 00:46:29,978
It's a kind of magic

511
00:46:32,551 --> 00:46:34,781
Firelight makes time stand still

512
00:46:36,488 --> 00:46:37,955
When you put out the lamps

513
00:46:38,624 --> 00:46:40,615
And sit in the firelight's glow...

514
00:46:42,027 --> 00:46:44,154
...there aren't any rules anymore

515
00:46:53,839 --> 00:46:55,136
Your can do what you want

516
00:46:55,507 --> 00:46:56,531
Say what you want

517
00:46:57,176 --> 00:46:58,438
Be what you want

518
00:47:00,813 --> 00:47:02,280
And when the lamps are lit again

519
00:47:03,182 --> 00:47:04,979
Time starts again

520
00:47:06,385 --> 00:47:08,751
And everything you said or did forgotten

521
00:47:09,955 --> 00:47:11,980
More than forgotten

522
00:47:12,291 --> 00:47:13,952
It never happened

523
00:47:16,795 --> 00:47:18,126
I can do what I want?

524
00:47:20,666 --> 00:47:21,325
I want to go

525
00:47:22,101 --> 00:47:22,829
Then go

526
00:47:26,038 --> 00:47:27,699
It's been unlocked since lunchtime

527
00:48:01,774 --> 00:48:02,399
All right?

528
00:48:04,777 --> 00:48:06,335
To a famous vitory

529
00:48:07,479 --> 00:48:08,036
Don't say that

530
00:48:08,447 --> 00:48:10,142
Louisa's too young to be defeated

531
00:48:10,282 --> 00:48:12,113
Then we shall drink to you

532
00:48:13,152 --> 00:48:13,811
To Miss Laurier

533
00:48:19,992 --> 00:48:22,552
Govemesses have tried
to control Louisa and failed

534
00:48:24,062 --> 00:48:26,360
Only Miss Laurier realized
she must first control Charles

535
00:48:28,233 --> 00:48:29,427
But look at him

536
00:48:30,002 --> 00:48:31,026
He's not at all grateful

537
00:48:37,409 --> 00:48:39,309
I understand you're leaving in month

538
00:48:41,747 --> 00:48:42,509
Where do you go?

539
00:48:44,616 --> 00:48:45,412
To another situation

540
00:48:47,452 --> 00:48:47,975
Then what?

541
00:48:49,621 --> 00:48:50,417
I don't understand

542
00:48:51,623 --> 00:48:52,851
Years pass

543
00:48:53,091 --> 00:48:54,615
You're no longer required. Then what?

544
00:48:55,694 --> 00:48:56,661
Do you return to Switzerland?

545
00:49:00,632 --> 00:49:01,860
I can't see into the future

546
00:49:03,068 --> 00:49:05,730
Some say the future is what you make it

547
00:49:07,973 --> 00:49:09,600
In America, certainly

548
00:49:10,776 --> 00:49:12,505
In America. That's what I mean

549
00:49:14,246 --> 00:49:14,803
In America

550
00:49:38,036 --> 00:49:39,094
Good night, darling

551
00:49:44,276 --> 00:49:45,971
We've begun now

552
00:50:10,869 --> 00:50:11,858
Your asked to see me?

553
00:50:13,906 --> 00:50:14,497
Yes

554
00:50:15,340 --> 00:50:17,501
I wanted a moment alone with you before I go

555
00:50:18,377 --> 00:50:18,809
Please. Have a seat

556
00:50:23,815 --> 00:50:24,304
Miss Laurier...

557
00:50:25,284 --> 00:50:26,410
...I won't waste your time

558
00:50:28,620 --> 00:50:29,678
I'm a single man

559
00:50:30,055 --> 00:50:31,522
With 5,000 acres to my name

560
00:50:33,225 --> 00:50:34,886
If you would consider a life in America

561
00:50:36,094 --> 00:50:37,493
I would be proud to take you there

562
00:50:38,964 --> 00:50:40,329
As my wife

563
00:50:42,534 --> 00:50:44,434
You pay me a very great compliment, sir

564
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:49,302
But the answer is no

565
00:50:50,575 --> 00:50:51,303
I'm afraid so

566
00:50:54,346 --> 00:50:57,941
You don't know till you ask

567
00:50:59,718 --> 00:51:01,242
You're not too disappointed, I think

568
00:51:04,157 --> 00:51:05,784
I hardly know you

569
00:51:05,892 --> 00:51:07,951
So I won't act as
if I can't live without you, but...

570
00:51:08,895 --> 00:51:12,729
A man can get his hopes up
pretty high pretty quick

571
00:51:14,734 --> 00:51:15,223
I'm sorry

572
00:51:17,003 --> 00:51:18,402
Just so I know...

573
00:51:20,740 --> 00:51:23,174
I'll be doing this again one of these days

574
00:51:26,045 --> 00:51:27,740
Is there anything I can fix?

575
00:51:29,349 --> 00:51:30,475
Like my dress...

576
00:51:31,584 --> 00:51:32,551
...how I talk?

577
00:51:33,686 --> 00:51:34,880
No, Mr. Taylor

578
00:51:35,722 --> 00:51:38,316
Any lady would be fortunate to be courted by you

579
00:51:39,192 --> 00:51:40,250
Any lady but you

580
00:51:55,375 --> 00:51:56,433
Louisa, darling, please

581
00:51:57,777 --> 00:51:58,471
You promised me

582
00:52:01,080 --> 00:52:02,707
Louisa, I can't bear this

583
00:52:03,383 --> 00:52:04,247
That's why she does it

584
00:52:04,851 --> 00:52:06,944
Damnation! Can't I feel for my own child

585
00:52:07,787 --> 00:52:10,051
Feel for her, but don't pity her

586
00:52:10,490 --> 00:52:11,320
Louisa, let go

587
00:52:12,558 --> 00:52:12,956
Please

588
00:52:18,231 --> 00:52:20,256
Go, then. If you want to go, go

589
00:52:27,140 --> 00:52:27,936
Will you all right, darling?

590
00:52:28,741 --> 00:52:30,971
You don't care, so what does it matter?

591
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:42,449
Now it's just you and me

592
00:52:43,456 --> 00:52:44,514
Shall we start our lessons?

593
00:52:47,794 --> 00:52:48,886
I don't have to obey you

594
00:52:49,529 --> 00:52:50,587
You're just servant

595
00:52:50,963 --> 00:52:52,624
That's enough! Be silent

596
00:52:54,300 --> 00:52:56,427
You will obey me, whether you want to or not...

597
00:52:57,203 --> 00:52:58,568
...because, poor as I am

598
00:52:58,671 --> 00:53:00,002
I am in authority over you

599
00:53:00,173 --> 00:53:02,368
You will not speak disrespectfully

600
00:53:02,475 --> 00:53:04,340
Or raise your voice to me

601
00:53:04,710 --> 00:53:07,201
Servant. Servant. Servant

602
00:53:07,647 --> 00:53:09,308
Servant. Servant. Servant

603
00:53:09,782 --> 00:53:11,010
Servant. Servant

604
00:53:11,150 --> 00:53:13,618
Servant. Servant. Servant. Servant

605
00:53:23,696 --> 00:53:25,459
I'm a prisoner, not a servant

606
00:53:25,631 --> 00:53:27,030
So will you be when you grow up

607
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:28,864
The day you come of age

608
00:53:28,968 --> 00:53:32,096
The gates wil close around you
because you are a woman

609
00:53:33,139 --> 00:53:33,901
If you marry

610
00:53:34,040 --> 00:53:36,634
What you own becomes your husband's property

611
00:53:36,742 --> 00:53:38,767
If you don't marry,
every profession will be closed to you but one

612
00:53:38,911 --> 00:53:42,574
And that one is a life of
loneliness and humiliation

613
00:53:42,782 --> 00:53:45,512
That lock you up, Louisa

614
00:53:47,019 --> 00:53:49,283
But there's one door they can't lock

615
00:53:49,388 --> 00:53:51,356
They can't imprison your mind

616
00:53:51,891 --> 00:53:53,756
That's why I want you to learn to read

617
00:53:54,327 --> 00:53:56,488
I want you to have your own life

618
00:54:00,032 --> 00:54:01,624
Write and tell me when Southdowns win prizes

619
00:54:01,801 --> 00:54:03,860
Come and see for yourself

620
00:54:04,770 --> 00:54:05,361
Maybe I will

621
00:54:05,771 --> 00:54:07,204
Best grazing anywhere

622
00:54:07,340 --> 00:54:08,102
Twenty dollars an acere

623
00:54:08,207 --> 00:54:08,901
Think about it

624
00:54:11,811 --> 00:54:13,108
You find time for the other business

625
00:54:13,980 --> 00:54:14,776
She turned me down

626
00:54:16,149 --> 00:54:16,706
She turned you down?

627
00:54:17,817 --> 00:54:19,250
I guess there's someone else

628
00:54:20,086 --> 00:54:21,519
Lucky fellow, is all I can say

629
00:54:22,455 --> 00:54:23,251
Goodbye, Charles

630
00:55:02,328 --> 00:55:02,987
Don't go

631
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:09,199
Constance will be down shortly

632
00:55:10,303 --> 00:55:10,962
As you wish

633
00:55:26,786 --> 00:55:29,084
Taylor told me he made you an offer

634
00:55:29,622 --> 00:55:30,748
And you refused him

635
00:55:30,990 --> 00:55:31,547
Yes

636
00:55:34,493 --> 00:55:35,960
For Louisa's sake, I presume

637
00:55:38,064 --> 00:55:39,031
Yes

638
00:55:45,371 --> 00:55:47,669
The fire gives more light than one expects

639
00:56:03,189 --> 00:56:04,281
No lamps lit?

640
00:56:05,358 --> 00:56:06,689
What is Jane thinking of?

641
00:56:24,677 --> 00:56:26,645
I don't know how much you want to know

642
00:56:36,088 --> 00:56:37,112
I remember...

643
00:56:42,061 --> 00:56:43,221
...the firelight

644
00:56:46,565 --> 00:56:47,361
I remember...

645
00:56:53,072 --> 00:56:54,767
...too much

646
00:57:44,891 --> 00:57:45,323
"Tree"

647
00:57:47,861 --> 00:57:48,486
"Eye"

648
00:57:49,796 --> 00:57:50,455
"See"

649
00:57:54,501 --> 00:57:54,933
"Pig"

650
00:57:57,137 --> 00:57:57,626
"Dig"

651
00:57:58,972 --> 00:57:59,461
"Wig" This is stupid

652
00:58:06,012 --> 00:58:06,569
"Bad"

653
00:58:10,684 --> 00:58:11,708
"Sad"

654
00:58:16,256 --> 00:58:17,052
"Happy"

655
00:58:17,758 --> 00:58:18,850
I suppose it's "glad"

656
00:58:24,197 --> 00:58:24,993
"Mad"

657
00:58:38,478 --> 00:58:40,503
When I was young, I had no mother

658
00:58:42,215 --> 00:58:43,842
She died just after I was born

659
00:58:46,019 --> 00:58:47,577
I loved my father very much

660
00:58:49,189 --> 00:58:51,282
But what I wanted most was a mother

661
00:59:02,335 --> 00:59:04,360
The sick lady's not my real mother

662
00:59:07,107 --> 00:59:07,630
Yes, I know

663
00:59:08,875 --> 00:59:10,308
My real mother's not sick

664
00:59:11,678 --> 00:59:12,235
Where is she?

665
00:59:14,314 --> 00:59:15,178
It's a secret

666
00:59:18,718 --> 00:59:19,946
Do you ever see her?

667
00:59:20,620 --> 00:59:22,087
Of course. Every day

668
00:59:22,956 --> 00:59:24,150
What do you do with her?

669
00:59:26,827 --> 00:59:27,885
Just be with her

670
01:00:10,003 --> 01:00:10,594
Miss Laurier?

671
01:00:12,005 --> 01:00:12,471
"See"?

672
01:00:14,374 --> 01:00:16,604
How do you know
she's not just reading the picture

673
01:00:17,444 --> 01:00:18,240
She is

674
01:00:19,079 --> 01:00:20,205
Then it's not reading

675
01:00:21,748 --> 01:00:22,976
No, it's only pretending

676
01:00:23,950 --> 01:00:26,248
But after a while,
the pretnese becomes the reality

677
01:00:27,454 --> 01:00:28,284
I see

678
01:00:36,096 --> 01:00:37,961
Louisa tells me
you have a story asbout firelight

679
01:00:38,765 --> 01:00:42,360
I tell her firelight is a magic time

680
01:00:43,236 --> 01:00:44,396
When time stands still

681
01:00:45,338 --> 01:00:47,363
Why do you tell her that?

682
01:00:47,541 --> 01:00:48,599
I find it helps

683
01:00:49,943 --> 01:00:52,104
A time with no rules, at the end of the day

684
01:01:00,353 --> 01:01:01,786
I must ask you to help me

685
01:01:04,190 --> 01:01:04,781
How?

686
01:01:06,626 --> 01:01:08,059
There was a time, a short time

687
01:01:08,194 --> 01:01:09,354
When we were close,

688
01:01:09,529 --> 01:01:10,928
You and I

689
01:01:13,934 --> 01:01:14,866
Do your remember it?

690
01:01:16,236 --> 01:01:16,998
Oh yes

691
01:01:22,409 --> 01:01:24,809
Tell me that
time is over and can neveer come again

692
01:01:29,883 --> 01:01:31,009
You don't answer

693
01:01:38,892 --> 01:01:40,985
What happens when time stands still?

694
01:01:43,196 --> 01:01:44,458
In the firelight...

695
01:01:45,832 --> 01:01:47,356
...you can do what you want

696
01:01:49,069 --> 01:01:49,967
Say what you want

697
01:01:51,571 --> 01:01:52,731
Be what you want

698
01:01:59,779 --> 01:02:01,110
When the lamps are lit again

699
01:02:01,915 --> 01:02:03,007
Time starts again, but...

700
01:02:04,384 --> 01:02:06,909
...everything you said or did is forgotten

701
01:02:07,587 --> 01:02:09,214
More than forgotten

702
01:02:10,156 --> 01:02:12,124
It never happened

703
01:04:44,612 --> 01:04:45,943
God, I hate the country

704
01:04:46,080 --> 01:04:46,739
It's so damn cold

705
01:04:46,947 --> 01:04:47,971
Into the mausoleum

706
01:04:48,182 --> 01:04:49,114
Hello, Connie

707
01:04:50,317 --> 01:04:51,682
Terrible journey

708
01:04:51,852 --> 01:04:53,046
The roads get worse every year

709
01:04:54,121 --> 01:04:55,452
Who are all these people?

710
01:04:55,856 --> 01:04:56,481
Fiddlers

711
01:04:58,392 --> 01:04:58,881
You!

712
01:04:59,059 --> 01:05:00,822
More coal on the fire before I freeze to death

713
01:05:01,595 --> 01:05:02,994
Come on in, Manzini

714
01:05:03,097 --> 01:05:04,223
Herd your fellows in

715
01:05:05,065 --> 01:05:07,090
One can't have a dance without music, Connie

716
01:05:08,235 --> 01:05:09,031
Fire!

717
01:05:09,203 --> 01:05:10,670
Can't bend, me lord

718
01:05:10,838 --> 01:05:12,328
My wig falls off

719
01:05:14,308 --> 01:05:17,471
Yes, here I am. Hello there, little missy

720
01:05:17,645 --> 01:05:18,270
Who are these people?

721
01:05:18,612 --> 01:05:20,375
Christmas cheer

722
01:05:20,481 --> 01:05:21,345
What is it about this house?

723
01:05:21,448 --> 01:05:23,040
The moment I walk in, I want to kill myself

724
01:05:25,486 --> 01:05:26,953
Damn it, don't preach at me

725
01:05:27,454 --> 01:05:29,422
I have to sell one of the farms

726
01:05:29,690 --> 01:05:30,884
Never sell land

727
01:05:31,025 --> 01:05:32,720
The one sensible thing my father told me

728
01:05:32,860 --> 01:05:34,828
Why borrow money
if all you mean is to give it back

729
01:05:35,696 --> 01:05:36,321
Where's Molly?

730
01:05:37,464 --> 01:05:38,897
Are there any more debts?

731
01:05:39,066 --> 01:05:41,159
How do I know? I just live my life

732
01:05:41,902 --> 01:05:44,166
All for the sake of a few years of pleasure

733
01:05:44,839 --> 01:05:47,808
Pleasure is all there is
between us and the grave

734
01:05:48,309 --> 01:05:49,276
Hello, who are you?

735
01:05:49,844 --> 01:05:51,175
This is Miss Laurier

736
01:05:51,345 --> 01:05:53,142
This is my father, Lord Clare

737
01:05:54,448 --> 01:05:56,177
Miss Laurier is Louisa's govemess

738
01:05:57,151 --> 01:05:59,085
Never had a govemess like you

739
01:05:59,186 --> 01:06:00,118
Are you French?

740
01:06:00,221 --> 01:06:01,381
No, I'm from Switzerland

741
01:06:02,489 --> 01:06:04,184
Sacrifice your life if you want, Charles

742
01:06:04,258 --> 01:06:05,657
I'm enjoying mine

743
01:06:06,126 --> 01:06:07,388
Miss Laurier, is it?

744
01:06:07,561 --> 01:06:08,653
Do you polka?

745
01:06:38,425 --> 01:06:41,326
Well done, Charles. She's lovely

746
01:06:42,863 --> 01:06:45,195
Your Swiss govemess

747
01:06:46,166 --> 01:06:49,363
Yes, she's an excellent teacher

748
01:06:51,071 --> 01:06:52,038
I'm glad to hear it

749
01:06:55,442 --> 01:06:55,840
Connie

750
01:06:56,644 --> 01:06:58,771
What about a quick turn around the room?

751
01:06:59,313 --> 01:07:00,371
Why not?

752
01:07:13,560 --> 01:07:15,528
Poor lambkin, are you all right?

753
01:07:15,896 --> 01:07:16,590
Of course I am

754
01:07:16,830 --> 01:07:17,558
I'm so sorry

755
01:07:17,665 --> 01:07:19,098
I'll see to him, Miss Laurier

756
01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:21,792
I'm fine. I want to dance

757
01:07:22,403 --> 01:07:25,133
Why didn't you say?

758
01:07:33,213 --> 01:07:35,477
I never thought I'd get you on a dance floor

759
01:07:36,583 --> 01:07:37,811
There's a first time for everything

760
01:09:34,202 --> 01:09:35,134
You sent for me, sir?

761
01:09:38,239 --> 01:09:40,002
Well, are you or aren't you?

762
01:09:41,376 --> 01:09:42,434
Am I what?

763
01:09:43,144 --> 01:09:44,270
Didding Charles?

764
01:09:46,714 --> 01:09:47,612
Molly says you are

765
01:09:49,284 --> 01:09:51,149
And she can usually spot these things

766
01:09:51,953 --> 01:09:53,682
You judge everyone by yourself, sir?

767
01:09:56,658 --> 01:09:58,285
At least you know what I mean

768
01:09:58,793 --> 01:10:00,420
You're not going to swoon, are you?

769
01:10:02,097 --> 01:10:02,529
No

770
01:10:03,498 --> 01:10:04,829
Are you're wrong, missy

771
01:10:05,633 --> 01:10:07,533
I don't judge everyone by myself

772
01:10:08,169 --> 01:10:09,500
Least of all Charles

773
01:10:10,405 --> 01:10:11,667
I know he's not like me

774
01:10:11,773 --> 01:10:13,001
Because he's like my father

775
01:10:14,542 --> 01:10:16,237
The old bastard never thought much of me

776
01:10:18,580 --> 01:10:19,979
Duty this, duty that

777
01:10:23,118 --> 01:10:24,142
And now Charles

778
01:10:27,755 --> 01:10:30,189
Hard to have you son act like your father

779
01:10:33,962 --> 01:10:35,361
He must have been a child once

780
01:10:36,598 --> 01:10:37,895
Of course he was a child once

781
01:10:42,871 --> 01:10:44,099
Ah, you're right

782
01:10:47,242 --> 01:10:49,870
When he was a little fellow. I'd forgotten that

783
01:10:52,480 --> 01:10:55,745
When Charles was just sixteen, he said to me

784
01:10:56,084 --> 01:10:59,212
"Father, I can't respect a man
who lives only for pleasure

785
01:11:00,321 --> 01:11:01,345
You know what I replied?

786
01:11:03,525 --> 01:11:05,891
"You've no right to speak to me like that

787
01:11:05,994 --> 01:11:07,928
Until you've gotten well and truly fucked"

788
01:11:09,397 --> 01:11:09,795
Well...

789
01:11:12,066 --> 01:11:13,590
...now he has

790
01:11:19,307 --> 01:11:20,296
Good for you, missy

791
01:11:22,510 --> 01:11:23,442
Good for you

792
01:11:27,949 --> 01:11:28,608
And you'r right, of course

793
01:11:32,086 --> 01:11:33,519
He's my boy

794
01:12:42,090 --> 01:12:44,115
She pretends her mother is there

795
01:12:44,259 --> 01:12:45,658
I know. We're all pretending

796
01:12:47,462 --> 01:12:48,554
When you come into a room

797
01:12:49,664 --> 01:12:51,256
I pretend I haven't noticed you

798
01:12:52,066 --> 01:12:53,363
Then I look...

799
01:12:54,535 --> 01:12:56,298
...and there's nothing in the world but you

800
01:12:59,841 --> 01:13:00,705
Sometimes I think

801
01:13:00,808 --> 01:13:02,503
Why don't we just go away?

802
01:13:03,511 --> 01:13:05,411
You, me, Louisa

803
01:13:05,546 --> 01:13:06,843
Would you come with me?

804
01:13:07,849 --> 01:13:08,645
Why ask?

805
01:13:08,816 --> 01:13:10,306
It's only pretending

806
01:13:10,418 --> 01:13:11,350
You can't leave

807
01:13:11,853 --> 01:13:13,252
I don't think I can bear it

808
01:13:13,855 --> 01:13:16,221
You have a duty to your estate, your familiy

809
01:13:16,324 --> 01:13:16,847
Your wife

810
01:13:17,792 --> 01:13:19,123
How can you be so calm?

811
01:13:20,528 --> 01:13:21,222
Not calm

812
01:13:28,436 --> 01:13:29,869
Stay with me tonight

813
01:13:31,005 --> 01:13:32,267
All right

814
01:14:42,577 --> 01:14:43,475
Louisa

815
01:14:46,348 --> 01:14:48,009
Come back! It's not safe!

816
01:14:51,220 --> 01:14:52,551
Louisa, don't leave me!

817
01:16:03,992 --> 01:16:06,119
Sleep, darling. Sleep

818
01:16:38,227 --> 01:16:39,694
I'll never leave you

819
01:16:41,363 --> 01:16:42,421
Never

820
01:17:31,280 --> 01:17:32,406
They're making a imventory

821
01:17:34,950 --> 01:17:36,577
Charles left for town at first light

822
01:17:37,953 --> 01:17:40,012
Mr. Dodds says the estate is to be sold

823
01:17:47,229 --> 01:17:48,753
What will become of us all?

824
01:17:51,333 --> 01:17:51,958
Who knows?

825
01:17:53,468 --> 01:17:54,992
Maybe it's for the best

826
01:17:56,738 --> 01:17:58,638
Sometimes this house feels like a prison

827
01:17:59,908 --> 01:18:01,637
Mr. Godwin loves it very much

828
01:18:03,078 --> 01:18:04,443
He did once

829
01:18:07,182 --> 01:18:11,710
But this house died the day Amy didn't die

830
01:18:14,356 --> 01:18:15,880
I wish she had died

831
01:18:17,626 --> 01:18:18,524
Does that shock you?

832
01:18:20,929 --> 01:18:21,554
No

833
01:18:25,100 --> 01:18:26,067
There's a law, of course...

834
01:18:26,234 --> 01:18:30,898
...that forbids a man
from marrying his dead wife's sister

835
01:18:32,541 --> 01:18:35,066
But it's an absurd law, easily evaded

836
01:18:35,877 --> 01:18:37,276
If Mrs. Godwin were to die

837
01:18:37,379 --> 01:18:39,279
You and Mr. Godwin would marry

838
01:18:45,287 --> 01:18:47,278
I don't pretend he loves me as he loved Amy

839
01:18:51,326 --> 01:18:52,816
But ten years is a long time

840
01:18:56,498 --> 01:18:57,965
We've grown older together

841
01:18:59,434 --> 01:19:01,026
There's a kind of closeness in that

842
01:19:14,716 --> 01:19:15,273
"Fire"

843
01:19:24,359 --> 01:19:25,155
"God"

844
01:19:32,300 --> 01:19:33,062
"Hat"

845
01:19:34,036 --> 01:19:34,934
What's the word?

846
01:19:35,570 --> 01:19:36,059
"Hat"

847
01:19:37,039 --> 01:19:37,971
How do you know?

848
01:19:38,473 --> 01:19:39,462
Because of the picture

849
01:19:45,447 --> 01:19:46,414
How do I know?

850
01:20:34,730 --> 01:20:35,924
Charles, you're back?

851
01:20:37,299 --> 01:20:38,391
Will everything be all right?

852
01:20:40,103 --> 01:20:42,037
No. Nothing will be all right

853
01:20:47,009 --> 01:20:48,306
Are there so very many debts?

854
01:20:50,847 --> 01:20:51,313
Yes

855
01:20:54,283 --> 01:20:56,308
Yes and damage is well and truly done

856
01:20:57,386 --> 01:20:58,512
The estate will have to go

857
01:21:02,091 --> 01:21:04,025
Oh, Charles

858
01:21:05,228 --> 01:21:06,718
I'm so sorry

859
01:21:07,396 --> 01:21:09,125
It's not right. Something should be done

860
01:21:10,233 --> 01:21:12,030
No, it's not right

861
01:21:13,102 --> 01:21:15,502
But nothing will be done

862
01:21:20,543 --> 01:21:21,635
What will become of us?

863
01:21:25,882 --> 01:21:26,473
Who knows?

864
01:21:51,507 --> 01:21:53,737
It's a cold night, Amy

865
01:21:54,777 --> 01:21:55,937
Bitter cold

866
01:21:57,713 --> 01:21:59,840
I've often thought this is a prison for you

867
01:22:03,452 --> 01:22:04,646
That if you could speak...

868
01:22:06,055 --> 01:22:07,317
...you'd ask me to...

869
01:22:12,895 --> 01:22:14,795
You'd ask me to let you go

870
01:22:17,166 --> 01:22:19,361
But I have to know that you want it

871
01:22:31,380 --> 01:22:33,280
Show me what yo want, Amy

872
01:22:40,022 --> 01:22:42,320
Show me what you want

873
01:24:06,442 --> 01:24:07,932
Lord, from You we come

874
01:24:08,077 --> 01:24:09,704
To You we must return

875
01:24:16,652 --> 01:24:18,347
Take my beloved wife

876
01:25:10,740 --> 01:25:12,230
Sometime in the night, I'd say

877
01:25:13,542 --> 01:25:14,440
It was a very cold night

878
01:25:18,814 --> 01:25:20,372
I understand the fire had gone out

879
01:25:24,820 --> 01:25:26,185
That was unfortunate

880
01:25:27,523 --> 01:25:28,615
It wasn't me, sir

881
01:25:28,758 --> 01:25:30,157
I'll swear on the good book

882
01:25:30,459 --> 01:25:31,551
Nobody's blaming you, Hannah

883
01:25:33,896 --> 01:25:34,590
It's been ten years

884
01:25:37,333 --> 01:25:38,664
At least now she's at peace

885
01:25:40,202 --> 01:25:40,691
Indeed

886
01:25:44,106 --> 01:25:44,697
Indeed

887
01:25:50,880 --> 01:25:52,142
I think we should leave

888
01:26:36,726 --> 01:26:37,658
You haven't eaten

889
01:26:38,728 --> 01:26:39,786
No, I...

890
01:26:43,667 --> 01:26:44,565
Are you all right?

891
01:26:46,203 --> 01:26:47,227
Yes, I think so

892
01:26:55,112 --> 01:26:56,977
I loved Amy dearly

893
01:26:59,549 --> 01:27:00,846
But I know...

894
01:27:04,221 --> 01:27:06,416
...this is for the best

895
01:27:10,093 --> 01:27:11,390
You really believe that?

896
01:27:13,830 --> 01:27:14,694
Yes, I do

897
01:27:19,870 --> 01:27:20,768
Dear Connie...

898
01:27:22,672 --> 01:27:24,333
...you've been good to me all these years

899
01:27:28,245 --> 01:27:29,542
And you've been good to me

900
01:27:31,214 --> 01:27:32,340
So much is changing

901
01:27:32,482 --> 01:27:34,279
What's to become of us all?

902
01:27:36,653 --> 01:27:38,484
As you friend Mr. Taylor said...

903
01:27:40,257 --> 01:27:42,054
...the future's what we make it

904
01:28:05,882 --> 01:28:06,314
I'm sorry

905
01:28:06,483 --> 01:28:07,677
No, don't speak

906
01:28:09,019 --> 01:28:09,610
I...

907
01:28:12,455 --> 01:28:14,389
It was a mistake, that's all

908
01:28:19,796 --> 01:28:23,732
I'm sorry to have disturbed you

909
01:28:27,304 --> 01:28:28,100
Connie

910
01:28:32,075 --> 01:28:33,542
Yes, Charles?

911
01:28:41,651 --> 01:28:43,414
You know how much I loved her

912
01:28:45,956 --> 01:28:47,048
Yes, Charles I do

913
01:28:56,199 --> 01:28:59,691
Behold, I show you a mystery

914
01:29:01,304 --> 01:29:04,569
We shall not all sleep,
but we shall all be changed...

915
01:29:05,642 --> 01:29:06,734
...in a moment

916
01:29:06,943 --> 01:29:08,433
In the twinkling of an eye...

917
01:29:12,148 --> 01:29:13,945
...at the last trump

918
01:29:14,117 --> 01:29:17,086
For the trumpets shall sound...

919
01:29:17,487 --> 01:29:19,387
...and the dead shall be raised incorruptible...

920
01:29:20,156 --> 01:29:23,557
...and we shall be chanted

921
01:29:24,160 --> 01:29:26,856
For corruptible must put on incorruption

922
01:29:27,163 --> 01:29:29,324
And this mortal... must put on immmortality

923
01:29:29,466 --> 01:29:32,765
So when this corruptible shall have put on
incorruption shall be borught to pass the saying

924
01:29:33,303 --> 01:29:37,171
That it is written
death is swallowed up in victory

925
01:29:37,340 --> 01:29:43,609
Oh, death, where is thy sting?

926
01:29:46,049 --> 01:29:53,148
Oh, grave, where is thy victory?

927
01:30:18,715 --> 01:30:19,477
Does he love you?

928
01:30:23,687 --> 01:30:24,483
Yes

929
01:30:28,124 --> 01:30:29,250
Do you love him?

930
01:30:30,627 --> 01:30:31,457
Yes

931
01:30:35,665 --> 01:30:37,462
I would have made him happy

932
01:30:42,772 --> 01:30:44,262
Love him for me, too

933
01:31:12,068 --> 01:31:13,035
Was it you?

934
01:31:16,806 --> 01:31:17,602
Yes

935
01:31:51,341 --> 01:31:53,036
I think it's what she wanted

936
01:31:55,011 --> 01:31:56,342
But I'll never know

937
01:32:01,718 --> 01:32:02,810
I must live with that

938
01:32:06,923 --> 01:32:07,651
As must I

939
01:32:09,993 --> 01:32:11,119
You've done nothing

940
01:32:11,294 --> 01:32:12,056
Nothing?

941
01:32:15,865 --> 01:32:17,890
I've wnated you and Louisa...

942
01:32:18,001 --> 01:32:20,663
...with all my mind and heart and will

943
01:32:20,804 --> 01:32:22,533
For seven long years

944
01:32:23,373 --> 01:32:26,171
My desire has destroyed everything
that stood in its way

945
01:32:26,376 --> 01:32:28,844
Your wife...

946
01:32:29,913 --> 01:32:31,472
...your home, your world

947
01:32:33,384 --> 01:32:35,284
I never knew there was such power in desire

948
01:32:37,822 --> 01:32:39,380
And if it were so?

949
01:32:40,458 --> 01:32:41,550
Are you sorry?

950
01:32:42,059 --> 01:32:42,548
No

951
01:32:52,937 --> 01:32:54,234
Then we deserve each other

952
01:32:58,976 --> 01:33:02,139
May God have mercy on us

953
01:33:52,029 --> 01:33:53,963
For my English Daughter

954
01:34:09,280 --> 01:34:10,542
Why did you give me away?

955
01:34:14,885 --> 01:34:15,715
I didn't

956
01:34:17,054 --> 01:34:18,112
I sold you

957
01:34:31,602 --> 01:34:32,466
How much for?

958
01:34:34,972 --> 01:34:36,166
Five hundred pounds

959
01:34:38,442 --> 01:34:39,340
Is that a lot?

960
01:34:40,911 --> 01:34:42,173
It's a fortune

961
01:34:54,158 --> 01:34:55,250
I'm glad it was a lot

962
01:35:12,076 --> 01:35:12,940
Mama

963
01:35:16,780 --> 01:35:17,610
Mama

964
01:35:18,549 --> 01:35:19,015
My darling

965
01:35:19,583 --> 01:35:20,572
My baby

966
01:35:21,719 --> 01:35:22,413
Mama

967
01:35:27,891 --> 01:35:28,550
Mama
