1
00:03:18,138 --> 00:03:19,938
- It's all right.

2
00:03:20,568 --> 00:03:21,568
You fell asleep.

3
00:03:24,185 --> 00:03:25,925
You know what stop was yours?

4
00:03:28,392 --> 00:03:30,312
Is this your first time on here?

5
00:03:32,687 --> 00:03:33,687
Well...

6
00:03:33,751 --> 00:03:34,751
come on.

7
00:03:36,016 --> 00:03:39,496
I gotta go in the town anyway
I'll take you in the truck.

8
00:03:41,297 --> 00:03:43,217
Come on,
you're not in trouble.

9
00:04:09,776 --> 00:04:11,696
So where we going,
do you know?

10
00:04:14,311 --> 00:04:15,631
Are you new in school?

11
00:04:18,532 --> 00:04:19,552
What's your name?

12
00:04:19,889 --> 00:04:21,269
- Rowan.

13
00:04:21,397 --> 00:04:23,377
- Huh?
- Rowan.

14
00:04:23,802 --> 00:04:25,362
Rowan, huh.

15
00:04:25,917 --> 00:04:27,057
My name is Charlie.

16
00:04:29,393 --> 00:04:31,433
And you supposed to be
on bus 19?

17
00:04:35,369 --> 00:04:36,619
Rowan, bus 19.

18
00:04:38,798 --> 00:04:40,298
Is your address on there?

19
00:04:43,828 --> 00:04:45,568
I think I know where that is.

20
00:04:46,406 --> 00:04:48,746
I believe
that makes you my last stop.

21
00:05:37,322 --> 00:05:38,342
I go fill her up.

22
00:05:39,075 --> 00:05:40,935
It's a lot of cheaper out here.

23
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:47,690
I'll be right back.

24
00:05:55,963 --> 00:05:57,403
- Is that all?

25
00:06:02,038 --> 00:06:03,358
- Sir?
- Yeah.

26
00:06:04,448 --> 00:06:06,128
How much for the candy bars?

27
00:07:25,348 --> 00:07:27,212
- Just returning your boy.

28
00:07:27,213 --> 00:07:29,193
He fell asleep on the school bus.

29
00:07:30,858 --> 00:07:32,358
Oh, go on then.

30
00:07:34,104 --> 00:07:36,174
His first day worn him out.

31
00:07:36,175 --> 00:07:37,315
- I reckon.

32
00:07:38,214 --> 00:07:39,796
- I'll be bringing him home

33
00:07:39,797 --> 00:07:41,657
everyday,
if he rides the bus.

34
00:07:42,075 --> 00:07:45,254
It won't be for too long,
it shouldn't be at least.

35
00:07:45,255 --> 00:07:46,555
Why is that?

36
00:07:46,556 --> 00:07:48,698
- Well this is a foster home.

37
00:07:48,699 --> 00:07:52,059
They took him out this weekend,
some kind of emergency.

38
00:07:52,242 --> 00:07:56,262
But they needed a place right away
and as I was on the list, so...

39
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:57,750
- Huh.

40
00:07:58,115 --> 00:08:01,169
- They're already looking
for the next of kin.

41
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:03,270
They won't tell me 'what happened'.

42
00:08:03,344 --> 00:08:06,224
But, they're looking to place him
pretty quick.

43
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:44,071
- You got your things?

44
00:08:44,072 --> 00:08:45,072
- Yep.

45
00:08:48,001 --> 00:08:51,008
Don't look like
anyone is home, does it?

46
00:09:12,178 --> 00:09:13,258
Rowan,

47
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:17,070
have you ever been fishing?

48
00:09:20,244 --> 00:09:21,244
Never?

49
00:09:22,609 --> 00:09:24,109
Great day in the morning.

50
00:09:24,308 --> 00:09:27,188
Every Tennessean man
needs to know how to fish.

51
00:09:29,512 --> 00:09:30,512
You know what...

52
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,602
That fish and pole
are to do the trick.

53
00:09:39,603 --> 00:09:43,443
My daughter accompanied me
back here when she was little.

54
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:46,170
Of course
that was a long time ago.

55
00:09:46,272 --> 00:09:47,772
How old is she?

56
00:09:48,681 --> 00:09:50,721
Well let see, she's...

57
00:09:51,953 --> 00:09:53,813
well she's all grown up anyway.

58
00:09:56,589 --> 00:09:57,589
Here.

59
00:10:03,378 --> 00:10:04,998
Like this, see?

60
00:10:05,287 --> 00:10:06,487
You see that button?

61
00:10:07,288 --> 00:10:08,608
Hold that button down.

62
00:10:09,526 --> 00:10:10,526
Pull back.

63
00:10:13,462 --> 00:10:14,462
Just make sure,

64
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:17,240
let go of that button when you cast out.

65
00:11:15,449 --> 00:11:19,469
You don't think she'll mind
I took you fishing, do you?

66
00:11:21,277 --> 00:11:23,497
I don't think she care to often much.

67
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:24,808
I hope.

68
00:11:35,726 --> 00:11:38,486
- Do you wanna do it again sometime?

69
00:11:38,605 --> 00:11:39,605
- Sure.

70
00:13:46,537 --> 00:13:47,617
Charlie!

71
00:13:47,712 --> 00:13:49,452
- Ow, there you go.

72
00:13:49,568 --> 00:13:52,507
Look how your pole is bending,
he must be a big one, here.

73
00:13:52,508 --> 00:13:53,508
And you got it.

74
00:13:53,692 --> 00:13:55,012
Just keep the pole up.

75
00:13:55,556 --> 00:13:57,536
There you go.
A little bit more.

76
00:13:57,565 --> 00:13:58,645
A little bit more.

77
00:13:58,692 --> 00:14:01,676
- It's slipping!
- No, no, just hold on, you got it.

78
00:14:01,677 --> 00:14:02,937
Just, make it steady.

79
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:05,500
Hold it up.
Pulling in a little bit.

80
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:06,860
There you go.

81
00:14:07,037 --> 00:14:09,147
A little bit more.
A little bit more!

82
00:14:09,148 --> 00:14:10,888
Pull your pole back a little.

83
00:14:10,949 --> 00:14:11,949
There you go.

84
00:14:12,021 --> 00:14:13,641
Not too much, you break it.

85
00:14:13,906 --> 00:14:15,166
Now,
let's see here.

86
00:14:16,256 --> 00:14:17,256
Ow,

87
00:14:17,271 --> 00:14:18,413
beautiful.

88
00:14:18,831 --> 00:14:20,391
Hey, you did it!

89
00:15:09,261 --> 00:15:10,581
Okay, pal.

90
00:15:12,491 --> 00:15:13,691
Charlie...

91
00:15:14,514 --> 00:15:17,634
- Yah?
- I see you tomorrow, right?

92
00:15:18,868 --> 00:15:21,148
Yeah,
I don't see why not.

93
00:16:12,159 --> 00:16:13,299
Rowan?!

94
00:22:48,041 --> 00:22:49,152
The End

95
00:22:49,448 --> 00:22:51,810
