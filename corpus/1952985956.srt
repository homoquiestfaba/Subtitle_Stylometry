♪Narrator:
isn't Christmas beautiful?

2
00:00:24,591 --> 00:00:27,470
The decorations, the ornaments
and my favorite--

3
00:00:27,494 --> 00:00:29,940
gingerbread! Yum!

4
00:00:37,271 --> 00:00:39,046
My name's Rusty.

5
00:00:39,072 --> 00:00:41,712
And I hope you're in the mood
for a good old-fashioned Christmas tail,

6
00:00:41,742 --> 00:00:43,415
'cause I've got one.

7
00:00:51,485 --> 00:00:54,261
This wasn't just any Christmas.

8
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:11,175
Yep, that's me-- Rusty Campbell.

9
00:01:11,204 --> 00:01:14,549
No, that-- that's not me.
Over-- move over-- yeah, that's me.

10
00:01:14,575 --> 00:01:16,282
Cheri:
Look at you, Mr. Handsome.

11
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:18,984
( Rusty narrating ) And that beautiful
babe next to me-- that's Cheri.

12
00:01:19,012 --> 00:01:20,013
Watch it, buster.

13
00:01:20,047 --> 00:01:22,823
What?
I'm telling the story here.

14
00:01:22,849 --> 00:01:26,194
Seriously, folks, isn't she the most
beautiful bride you've ever seen?

15
00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:28,392
Your owner's not so bad either.

16
00:01:28,422 --> 00:01:30,868
Man:
Do you, Jake, take Susan

17
00:01:30,891 --> 00:01:32,700
to be your lawfully wedded wife,

18
00:01:32,726 --> 00:01:36,299
to have and to hold,
in sickness and in health,

19
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:38,810
for as long as you both
shall live?

20
00:01:42,035 --> 00:01:44,276

Oops, getting ahead of ourselves here.

( Rusty narrating ) It was early October
and Susan had taken me

39
00:03:11,658 --> 00:03:14,002
to the dog park
for some quality bonding time.

40
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:16,837
Little did I know
my life was about to change forever.

41
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:17,163
There's got to be something
available, Pat.

42
00:03:17,164 --> 00:03:19,405
There's got to be something
available, Pat.

43
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:24,939
No, Susan, listen,
you've got to be patient, okay?

44
00:03:24,971 --> 00:03:26,609
Susan:
There's got to be something.

45
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,914
You hear that?

46
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:30,444
That's not sleigh bells.
That's the sound of crickets.

47
00:03:30,477 --> 00:03:34,948
Towards the end of the year,
none of the major museums are hiring.

48
00:03:34,981 --> 00:03:36,085
None of them?

49
00:03:36,116 --> 00:03:38,528
Relax. Don't get your bloomers
in a bunch, okay?

50
00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:41,465
A curator with your qualifications
is gonna get offers.

51
00:03:41,488 --> 00:03:43,195
It's just gonna take some time.

52
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:44,702
Well, I hope so.

53
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:46,635
Maybe something back East,

54
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:48,640
let me get out of California
altogether.

55
00:03:48,662 --> 00:03:51,165
Don't worry, you will.
But in the meantime, do me a favor.

56
00:03:51,198 --> 00:03:53,644
You know how those small towns are--
they suck you in.

57
00:03:53,667 --> 00:03:56,580
And next thing you know you're running
a little coffee shop or something..

58
00:03:56,603 --> 00:03:59,709
Don't worry.
I'm a city girl.

59
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,686
The small town is not for me.

60
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:03,517
( Rusty narrating )
That's when I saw her,

61
00:04:03,543 --> 00:04:05,819
her tail floated through the air
like a cloud.

62
00:04:05,846 --> 00:04:08,156
I just love a woman
with a sense of style.

63
00:04:08,181 --> 00:04:09,421
-( Rusty barks )
- Rusty!

64
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:11,486
Is everything okay up there, Susan?

65
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:14,392
Rusty, Rusty.

66
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:17,868
You go get 'em, Sue.
You go get 'em. All right, all right.

67
00:04:19,226 --> 00:04:21,297
Pat here.
How can I be of service?

68
00:04:22,462 --> 00:04:26,171
You need a job, huh? Well,
you came to the right place, buddy.

69
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:28,805
I'm going into a tunnel. Oh my gosh.
Oh look, I'm losing you.

70
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:32,644
Don't touch my fish.
They're poisonous.

71
00:04:32,672 --> 00:04:35,915
- Rusty: Hey there.
- This is an A and B conversation,

72
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:38,252
so why don't you C your way
out of it?

73
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:39,780
My name is Rusty.

74
00:04:39,813 --> 00:04:41,349
I'm Not Interested.

75
00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:43,361
At least tell me your name.
If you don't tell me,

76
00:04:43,383 --> 00:04:46,296
I'm going to have to guess.
Foo-Foo? Pookie? Tawana?

77
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:47,764
Cheri: Not even close.

78
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:49,597
Rusty, got you.

79
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:52,467
Cheri, I leave you for a minute, and
already you've made some friends here.

80
00:04:52,492 --> 00:04:55,905
( Rusty narrating ) Cheri. I loved
the way it rolled off the tongue--

81
00:04:55,929 --> 00:04:59,604
or the way it would have rolled off
the tongue if I could actually speak.

82
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:01,579
It was love at first sniff.

83
00:05:01,601 --> 00:05:04,138
Everything okay?
Lana, what are you up to?

84
00:05:04,171 --> 00:05:06,651
Oh, it's okay. I think they just
got away from us for a second.

85
00:05:07,941 --> 00:05:10,217
- It's good to see you, Jake.
- Thank you, Reverend. How are you?

86
00:05:10,243 --> 00:05:11,847
- I'm great. Thank you for asking.
- Good.

87
00:05:11,878 --> 00:05:13,983
Listen, I've got to run.
Hey, Susan, do me a favor.

88
00:05:14,014 --> 00:05:16,893
- Will you tell your mom I said hi?
- I will.

89
00:05:16,917 --> 00:05:19,761
See you guys later.
Come on, let's go, Lana. Come on.

90
00:05:19,786 --> 00:05:21,163
Hi.

91
00:05:21,188 --> 00:05:23,828
Rusty, you cannot run away
from Mommy like that.

92
00:05:23,857 --> 00:05:25,632
You about gave me a heart attack.

93
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:29,300
Okay, easy with the Mommy stuff.
I'm with a lady here.

94
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:31,172
Oh, it's okay.
They've got great security here.

95
00:05:31,198 --> 00:05:33,109
It's really not a problem.

96
00:05:33,133 --> 00:05:35,010
Besides, it looks like
they like each other.

97
00:05:35,035 --> 00:05:36,673
"Like" is a strong word.

98
00:05:36,703 --> 00:05:39,013
- Yeah.
- This is my Cheri.

99
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:41,679
Yes, I said Cheri.
And my name is Jake.

100
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:44,382
Cheri. Wow.

101
00:05:44,411 --> 00:05:47,290
I'm Susan and this is Rusty.

102
00:05:47,314 --> 00:05:50,488
Hey Rusty. How are you, buddy?
Well, it's nice to meet you guys.

103
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:52,258
I haven't seen you around though.
Are you new?

104
00:05:52,285 --> 00:05:54,765
Yeah, we just moved up
from LA.

105
00:05:54,788 --> 00:05:56,927
Oh, a city dog, huh?
I should have known.

106
00:05:56,957 --> 00:05:59,460
Really? That's a big change.
Why the move?

107
00:05:59,492 --> 00:06:01,665
Um, lots of reasons.

108
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:05,575
Mostly my mom has an antique store
over in Los Olives.

109
00:06:05,599 --> 00:06:08,239
Gussied Up--
maybe you've heard of it.

110
00:06:08,268 --> 00:06:11,374
- I have.
- Yeah, I'm just helping her out.

111
00:06:11,404 --> 00:06:13,213
Well, I hope your mom's
working you hard.

112
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:16,050
Oh yeah, she's a slave driver.

113
00:06:16,076 --> 00:06:18,056
In fact, I'd better get going.

114
00:06:18,078 --> 00:06:19,557
- Okay, sounds good.
- Okay.

115
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:21,286
Nice meeting you. Okay.
Come on, honey.

116
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:25,490
Hey, you know, if you want
to actually do something fun,

117
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:28,728
I work at a winery.
Bridle wood-- maybe you've heard of it.

118
00:06:28,755 --> 00:06:31,133
No, I haven't.

119
00:06:31,157 --> 00:06:34,604
If you would like,
I could give you a personal tour.

120
00:06:34,628 --> 00:06:39,600
Maybe Friday at 5:00, 1:30 or 2:30...

121
00:06:39,633 --> 00:06:41,909
-( Susan laughs)
- ...or 4:45-- whatever works for you?

122
00:06:41,935 --> 00:06:44,711
( Rusty narrating ) As I sat there
watching for what felt like an eternity,

123
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:47,241
all I could think about was,
"The next words out of her mouth

124
00:06:47,274 --> 00:06:49,117
could define my romantic destiny."

125
00:06:49,142 --> 00:06:50,849
Oh, you can be so dramatic.

126
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:54,381
Sounds like a plan.

127
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:56,690
Sounds good.
Nice meeting you.

128
00:06:56,716 --> 00:06:57,854
All right.

129
00:06:57,884 --> 00:07:00,023
It's been a pleasure
meeting you, madam.

130
00:07:00,053 --> 00:07:02,158
Oh, believe me,
the pleasure was all yours.

131
00:07:03,723 --> 00:07:05,669
Bye.

132
00:07:05,692 --> 00:07:07,035
Come on, Cheri.

133
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:09,563
( Rusty narrating ) I love it
when a plan comes together.

134
00:07:10,563 --> 00:07:13,043
That night I could barely sleep.

135
00:07:13,066 --> 00:07:15,478
She was all I could think about--
her gorgeous hair,

136
00:07:15,502 --> 00:07:18,142
the way her hindquarters shook
when she walked.

137
00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:20,208
Cheri: Hey, there might be
kids watching this.

138
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,221
Rusty: It turns out I wasn't
the only one bitten by the love bug.

139
00:07:23,243 --> 00:07:25,245
You met someone?

140
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:27,588
What's his name?
Does he have a job?

141
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:29,423
Mom, it's no big deal.

142
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,019
We met at the dog park.

143
00:07:41,528 --> 00:07:43,667
Hey!

144
00:07:43,697 --> 00:07:45,699
Dude.

145
00:07:45,732 --> 00:07:47,837
- Hey man.
- You just about gave me a heart attack.

146
00:07:47,867 --> 00:07:49,904
Sorry.
I was just cleaning this.

147
00:07:49,936 --> 00:07:51,574
So did you get
this whole thing cleaned?

148
00:07:51,604 --> 00:07:53,345
I cleaned it.
It's clean.

149
00:07:53,373 --> 00:07:54,647
- Hey.
- What?

150
00:07:54,674 --> 00:07:56,415
- I meta girl.
- What?

151
00:07:56,443 --> 00:07:58,445
Yes, at the dog park.
She's beautiful.

152
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,822
She's even got a little dog
that can hang out with my little Cheri.

153
00:08:00,847 --> 00:08:02,451
- Here's the kicker.
- What?

154
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,985
She's not from around here,
just moved into the area.

155
00:08:05,018 --> 00:08:08,431
And I told her I worked at a winery.
I invited her over for a little tour.

156
00:08:08,455 --> 00:08:11,493
He offered to show me around
the winery where he works.

157
00:08:11,524 --> 00:08:14,971
The winery? He works at--
does he own the winery?

158
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:18,067
You told her you work at a winery?
You should say, "I own a winery."

159
00:08:18,098 --> 00:08:20,009
- That's what I say.
- I don't know.

160
00:08:20,033 --> 00:08:21,569
Details.

161
00:08:21,601 --> 00:08:24,047
I guess I figured
new town-- new start.

162
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:25,777
Maybe it's time to get back
on the horse.

163
00:08:25,805 --> 00:08:27,910
Did you say anything
about the kids?

164
00:08:27,941 --> 00:08:30,444
Well, no. It was this fast. It was
like, "Hey, our dogs like each other.

165
00:08:30,477 --> 00:08:32,423
You want to come to the winery?"
It was that fast.

166
00:08:32,445 --> 00:08:34,015
I didn't get a chance
to talk about the kids.

167
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:36,721
Are you crazy?
You didn't say anything about the kids?

168
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,024
A single mother
of three boys--

169
00:08:38,051 --> 00:08:40,292
some men might find that
intimidating.

170
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,822
Wait wait wait,
don't you watch "Oprah"?

171
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:43,459
Sensitive guys are in, dude.

172
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:45,993
Says the guy who thought
"The Notebook" was a comedy.

173
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:49,132
Look, you don't know anything about him.
Just don't get hurt.

174
00:08:49,162 --> 00:08:51,904
I won't let myself get hurt, Mom.

175
00:08:51,931 --> 00:08:54,241
Okay, I have to go pick up the boys.

176
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:56,144
What time do we open anyway?

177
00:08:56,169 --> 00:08:58,547
Two hours ago.

178
00:09:00,073 --> 00:09:02,417
Okay, Rusty, let's go.

179
00:09:02,442 --> 00:09:04,752
Come on, let's go get your boys.

180
00:09:11,751 --> 00:09:15,460
Wait a second. So you don't
actually work at a vineyard?

181
00:09:15,488 --> 00:09:17,365
You own this vineyard?

182
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:20,894
I actually inherited it
when my folks passed away.

183
00:09:20,927 --> 00:09:23,305
Susan:
it's beautiful.

184
00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:24,808
Jake:
It is beautiful.

185
00:09:24,831 --> 00:09:27,744
I've actually had a lot of offers
from people to buy this place,

186
00:09:27,767 --> 00:09:30,111
but I can't imagine
anyone else managing it.

187
00:09:30,136 --> 00:09:33,640
And half the people that work here
have been here since before I was born.

188
00:09:34,707 --> 00:09:36,812
Whoa. Watch your step.

189
00:09:36,843 --> 00:09:39,187
- Here, hold on to my arm.
- Thank you.

190
00:09:39,212 --> 00:09:42,625
What about you?
What was your business back in LA?

191
00:09:42,649 --> 00:09:45,994
I was a curator
at the California Museum of Art.

192
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:47,521
- Really?
- Yes.

193
00:09:47,554 --> 00:09:49,591
Jake:
Wow. What happened?

194
00:09:49,622 --> 00:09:52,865
Budget cuts.
My department got consolidated.

195
00:09:52,892 --> 00:09:54,838
So here I am.

196
00:09:54,861 --> 00:09:56,033
Jake: Ouch.

197
00:09:56,062 --> 00:09:58,372
Susan:
Where are all the grapes?

198
00:09:58,398 --> 00:10:00,344
Jake: The grapes have already
been harvested.

199
00:10:00,366 --> 00:10:02,778
They've been barreled.
They're fermenting.

200
00:10:02,802 --> 00:10:04,577
And we'll bottle them
by Christmas.

201
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,845
Oh, Christmas.
I love Christmas.

202
00:10:06,873 --> 00:10:08,113
Yeah, me too.

203
00:10:08,141 --> 00:10:11,213
It's the time of year I can remember
my whole family being together.

204
00:10:11,244 --> 00:10:13,246
Jake: Mm.

205
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,451
Yeah.

206
00:10:14,481 --> 00:10:16,586
- Are you hungry?
- Yeah, I'm starving.

207
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:19,392
That's good, 'cause I had the chef
make something special for us.

208
00:10:19,419 --> 00:10:20,898
- Shall we?
- We shall.

209
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,957
Jake:
Let's do it. All right.

210
00:10:35,268 --> 00:10:37,270
- Jake: There it is.
- Frank: There you go.

211
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:39,249
Oh, that smells delicious.

212
00:10:39,272 --> 00:10:41,081
Sir.

213
00:10:41,107 --> 00:10:43,485
Okay.

214
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:44,955
Wow, thanks, Frank.

215
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:47,481
It's a special mixture
of black truffles, sausage

216
00:10:47,514 --> 00:10:49,391
and oyster stuffing

217
00:10:49,415 --> 00:10:52,658
in one stunning chicken.

218
00:10:52,685 --> 00:10:54,631
(Jake laughs)
Okay.

219
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:57,134
Or I'll be right back.

220
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:01,362
- That's Frank.
- Yeah, he's a keeper.

221
00:11:01,394 --> 00:11:03,396
He's my boy. He's my boy.

222
00:11:03,429 --> 00:11:06,410
Speaking of chicken,
did you know

223
00:11:06,432 --> 00:11:09,436
that the longest recorded flight
of a chicken was 13 seconds?

224
00:11:09,469 --> 00:11:12,177
No, I did not know that.

225
00:11:12,205 --> 00:11:14,151
I am an encyclopedia
of useless information.

226
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:17,280
Well, if you're speaking of poultry, did
you know that Donald Duck's middle name

227
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:18,516
was Fauntleroy?

228
00:11:18,545 --> 00:11:21,116
- Fascinating.
-( laughs)

229
00:11:21,147 --> 00:11:23,525
How about this one?
Cookie Monster's first name--

230
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:25,188
All together: Sid.

231
00:11:25,218 --> 00:11:27,528
Sorry. Yeah, food.

232
00:11:28,721 --> 00:11:30,462
That was very impressive.

233
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:34,131
Wow. Well, I guess we know
our children's programs here.

234
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,197
Apparently.

235
00:11:36,229 --> 00:11:38,334
- Hey, I actually wanted to talk--
- You know, there's something

236
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:40,674
I wanted to tell you.
Sorry, you go ahead.

237
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:43,146
Go ahead.
No, I insist.

238
00:11:45,138 --> 00:11:47,982
- I have three boys.
- I have two children.

239
00:11:48,007 --> 00:11:49,077
What?

240
00:11:49,108 --> 00:11:51,019
Really?

241
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:52,990
I can't believe
you just said that.

242
00:11:53,012 --> 00:11:54,992
You don't know how worried
I was to tell you that.

243
00:11:55,014 --> 00:11:57,290
No, I was worried that you were--
not that you were gonna say,

244
00:11:57,317 --> 00:12:00,958
but I was" I didn't want
to say it too. I'm--

245
00:12:00,987 --> 00:12:03,024
Can I show you pictures?

246
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:04,592
Yes, please.

247
00:12:04,624 --> 00:12:06,626
This is so great.
I had no idea.

248
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:08,935
- Really?
- Yes.

249
00:12:08,962 --> 00:12:10,964
- Why would you lie?
- I know.

250
00:12:10,997 --> 00:12:13,409
- Oh.
- That's my youngest.

251
00:12:13,433 --> 00:12:15,344
That's Emma.
She's seven.

252
00:12:15,368 --> 00:12:19,180
Oh, I bet she loves
ponies and Barbies and--

253
00:12:19,205 --> 00:12:21,378
Jake: More like spiders and frogs
and snakes.

254
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:24,854
You know, anything that slithers
or spits venom-- she's probably got it.

255
00:12:24,877 --> 00:12:26,982
Still, she's adorable.

256
00:12:27,013 --> 00:12:28,959
She's a cutie.

257
00:12:28,982 --> 00:12:31,292
And this is my oldest,
just turned 11,

258
00:12:31,317 --> 00:12:33,593
loves anything
with a ball or a puck.

259
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:36,396
Oh, he's so handsome.
What's his name?

260
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:38,231
Her name is Madison.

261
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:39,703
It's a girl?

262
00:12:39,726 --> 00:12:41,967
Jake: She wanted to join
the rugby team.

263
00:12:41,995 --> 00:12:45,067
I had to draw the line somewhere.
I hope I'm not scaring you right now.

264
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:46,736
No no, not at all.

265
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:48,837
In fact, here you go.

266
00:12:48,868 --> 00:12:50,973
The one on the left is Logan.

267
00:12:51,004 --> 00:12:52,881
He is going to be the first
nine-year-old

268
00:12:52,905 --> 00:12:54,543
with his own
four-star restaurant.

269
00:12:54,574 --> 00:12:56,417
Jake: That's amazing.
Well, maybe he can help me out

270
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:57,921
'cause I can barely boil
a pot of water.

271
00:12:57,944 --> 00:13:00,686
The one in the middle is Josh.

272
00:13:00,713 --> 00:13:04,058
He is gonna be the next
Mark Zuckerberg.

273
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:05,391
Jake: Is he really?

274
00:13:05,418 --> 00:13:07,261
Susan: I don't know where he finds
the time to study though.

275
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:09,028
He's always tinkering around
on his computer.

276
00:13:09,055 --> 00:13:10,329
And who's this little guy
on the end?

277
00:13:10,356 --> 00:13:12,461
Oh, that's my Ryan.

278
00:13:12,492 --> 00:13:15,473
He's too young.
He doesn't know what he wants to be.

279
00:13:15,495 --> 00:13:17,406
He's a snappy dresser.

280
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:20,468
Yeah, that's a new phase.

281
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:24,141
He actually hasn't said much
since his dad passed away.

282
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:26,582
I'm sorry to hear that.

283
00:13:26,606 --> 00:13:29,712
Yeah, the psychologists say
he will talk when he's ready.

284
00:13:29,742 --> 00:13:32,621
Well, after my wife passed
I had a really hard time

285
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:35,819
wanting to talk to anyone about it,
so I get what he's going through.

286
00:13:35,848 --> 00:13:39,352
It's a lot of emotion and pain
to deal with.

287
00:13:39,385 --> 00:13:42,298
Yeah, so much, you don't
really know what to do with it.

288
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:43,801
Exactly.

289
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:45,825
It's so hard.
I can only imagine

290
00:13:45,858 --> 00:13:47,633
how hard it must have been
for the boys.

291
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:52,109
Well, they're lucky to have a mom
like you to help them through it.

292
00:13:52,131 --> 00:13:53,940
Yeah.

293
00:14:04,277 --> 00:14:06,279
(Frogs chirping )

294
00:14:06,312 --> 00:14:09,020
Jake: Well, that was
kind of amazing.

295
00:14:09,048 --> 00:14:10,652
That was great.

296
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:13,493
It was really fun.
We should do it again.

297
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,521
Okay.

298
00:14:15,555 --> 00:14:17,933
Wow, you have frogs here.

299
00:14:17,957 --> 00:14:19,959
Yeah.

300
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:31,872
- Till the next time then.
- Okay.

301
00:14:47,253 --> 00:14:48,926
(Cheri narrating )
What can I say?

302
00:14:48,955 --> 00:14:51,401
My little Rusty was
an excellent matchmaker.

303
00:14:51,424 --> 00:14:53,233
Why don't you tell them
what happened next?

304
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:05,242
( Rusty narrating ) Once things
got rolling between them,

305
00:15:05,271 --> 00:15:07,148
things moved pretty fast.

306
00:15:07,173 --> 00:15:10,313
And Jake and Susan grew
closer and closer.

307
00:15:13,446 --> 00:15:15,392
Finally it was time
for the kids to meet.

308
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:18,919
( Cheri narrating ) They seemed to have
a great time, didn't they?

309
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:21,557
You're going down, sister.

310
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:24,295
You wish.
No one beats Madison.

311
00:15:24,323 --> 00:15:26,735
Hike the ball already.
Come on.

312
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,238
Hike.

Nice job. Let's go back.

to invite us all over
for Thanksgiving dinner.

- I didn't take it though.
- Yes, you did.

You guys, slow down by the pool.

How about something--

what is something you might be
grateful for, young man?

386
00:19:41,881 --> 00:19:44,691
Okay, we haven't heard anything
out of that side of the peanut gallery.

387
00:19:44,717 --> 00:19:45,991
- Oh, Dad.
- Yes, ma'am.

00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:47,861
- I'm thankful for sports.
- Lovely.

00:19:47,887 --> 00:19:49,662
Oh, cooking.

And what about you, Mama?

I'm thankful that my daughter has been
looking a little happier lately.

Aww. Thanks, Mom.

398
00:20:09,275 --> 00:20:11,255
I am.

399
00:20:11,277 --> 00:20:14,884
I am very thankful as well.

400
00:20:14,914 --> 00:20:17,485
In fact, I'm so thankful for

401
00:20:17,516 --> 00:20:21,396
how this group
has come together so lovingly,

402
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:24,629
I have something very special

403
00:20:24,657 --> 00:20:28,195
that I would like to ask
your mother.

404
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:32,205
Susan, can you stand up
for a second?

405
00:20:36,936 --> 00:20:38,540
I think he's gonna do it.

406
00:20:38,571 --> 00:20:40,107
Do what?

407
00:20:40,139 --> 00:20:42,517
What are you doing?

408
00:20:47,413 --> 00:20:49,791
Jake:
Susan Davis,

409
00:20:49,815 --> 00:20:52,421
you have made me happier

410
00:20:52,451 --> 00:20:55,830
than I have been
in a really long time.

411
00:20:55,855 --> 00:20:57,562
I think my daughters
can attest to that.

412
00:21:00,726 --> 00:21:04,196
And I don't want to stop feeling
that way for the rest of my life.

413
00:21:10,469 --> 00:21:14,076
Susan Davis, will you make me
the happiest man on earth

414
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:15,642
and marry me?

415
00:21:15,674 --> 00:21:18,348
Yes, I will.

416
00:21:25,685 --> 00:21:28,325
- I love you.
- I love you.

417
00:21:28,354 --> 00:21:30,300
Well, Cheri,
looks like you're stuck with me.

418
00:21:30,322 --> 00:21:32,734
Come here, big guy.

419
00:21:44,069 --> 00:21:45,810
Ryan.

420
00:21:52,812 --> 00:21:55,691
- I'll be right back.
- Yeah, it's okay.

421
00:22:00,686 --> 00:22:03,132
Hey, buddy.

422
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:05,635
What are you doing over here?

423
00:22:07,426 --> 00:22:09,804
Hey, look at me.

424
00:22:12,231 --> 00:22:14,233
I know that you're sad,

425
00:22:14,266 --> 00:22:17,270
but nobody could ever
replace your dad.

426
00:22:17,303 --> 00:22:20,876
Jake-- he cares very much
about you

427
00:22:20,906 --> 00:22:22,852
and your brothers.

428
00:22:22,875 --> 00:22:24,411
Rusty:
What are they even talking about?

429
00:22:24,443 --> 00:22:26,354
Cheri:
I have no idea.

430
00:22:26,378 --> 00:22:29,791
And you dad will always be
very special to me.

431
00:22:31,684 --> 00:22:33,686
But just think about it--

432
00:22:33,719 --> 00:22:36,290
wouldn't having a man around the house
be kind of cool,

433
00:22:36,322 --> 00:22:39,633
like maybe some sisters
running around?

434
00:22:42,761 --> 00:22:45,640
Look, everything's gonna be okay,
'cause you know what?

435
00:22:45,664 --> 00:22:48,577
Us getting married
is not about just us.

436
00:22:48,601 --> 00:22:50,945
It's about having a family.

437
00:22:52,872 --> 00:22:55,546
I promise
everything's gonna be okay.

438
00:22:58,043 --> 00:23:00,284
You'll see.

439
00:23:00,312 --> 00:23:02,314
Okay?

440
00:23:02,348 --> 00:23:05,090
Let's go eat.

441
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:15,227
Hey.

442
00:23:15,261 --> 00:23:18,572
Well, you think the little man's
gonna be okay?

443
00:23:18,597 --> 00:23:22,010
Susan:
Yeah. I know he's gonna love you.

444
00:23:22,034 --> 00:23:24,480
He just needs time.

445
00:23:24,503 --> 00:23:28,144
You know, we don't have to have
a huge wedding.

446
00:23:29,141 --> 00:23:33,021
No, I think we should.
I think it would be good for them.

447
00:23:34,513 --> 00:23:37,653
- Okay.
- Do you have a date in mind?

448
00:23:37,683 --> 00:23:40,892
Yeah.
I was thinking Christmas.

449
00:23:42,188 --> 00:23:44,429
You're kidding.

450
00:23:44,456 --> 00:23:46,458
No.

451
00:23:46,492 --> 00:23:49,302
You said it always
reminded you of family.

452
00:23:49,328 --> 00:23:51,069
Hmm?

453
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:53,406
I can't think of a better way
of celebrating

454
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:55,742
the two families
coming together.

455
00:23:55,768 --> 00:23:58,510
Besides, the kids will be off of school.
Everyone's gonna be in town.

456
00:23:58,537 --> 00:24:00,778
It'll be perfect.

457
00:24:00,806 --> 00:24:02,308
Hmm?

458
00:24:02,341 --> 00:24:04,821
- I love you.
- I love you too.

459
00:24:08,414 --> 00:24:10,018
Oh no.

460
00:24:10,049 --> 00:24:13,151
Jake:
Yeah, they'll be great together.

461
00:24:13,152 --> 00:24:15,359
( Rusty narrating ) Of course
with less than a month to go,

462
00:24:15,387 --> 00:24:17,424
things were bound
to get interesting.

463
00:24:23,095 --> 00:24:25,336
Frank:
Are you-- are you crazy?

464
00:24:25,364 --> 00:24:28,208
Jake: What is the big deal?
We're not getting any younger, come on.

465
00:24:28,233 --> 00:24:30,736
Frank: Well, are you sure
you're ready for this?

466
00:24:30,769 --> 00:24:33,579
Jake:
Of course I'm ready for this.

467
00:24:33,606 --> 00:24:36,610
She's sweet. She's smart.
She's super motivated.

468
00:24:36,642 --> 00:24:40,021
He's considerate and caring,
charming, funny.

469
00:24:40,045 --> 00:24:43,424
Mother: Well, I think the kids needs
a male figure in the house, you know.

470
00:24:43,449 --> 00:24:45,156
She's gonna be a great influence
on the girls.

471
00:24:45,184 --> 00:24:46,925
- It'll be perfect.
-( Frank moaning )

472
00:24:46,952 --> 00:24:50,024
What did the kids say about it?
I mean, Ryan didn't seem too happy.

473
00:24:50,055 --> 00:24:52,763
How are the girls taking it?
'Cause I'm not taking it very well.

474
00:24:52,791 --> 00:24:55,203
Jake: Well, it's not gonna happen
overnight, that's for sure.

475
00:24:55,227 --> 00:24:58,504
Do you know what? I think in the long
run it will be the best thing for them.

476
00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:00,703
Well, what about me?
What about what I want?

477
00:25:00,733 --> 00:25:03,270
When you said you were gonna get
back on the horse, I didn't expect you

478
00:25:03,302 --> 00:25:05,908
-to jump into the Kentucky Derby.
- Mom.

479
00:25:05,938 --> 00:25:09,181
I don't get it. I don't get it.
You just did the whole marriage thing

480
00:25:09,208 --> 00:25:12,189
and now you're on
the Sea of Tranquility.

481
00:25:12,211 --> 00:25:14,623
And there are tons of fish
in that sea.

482
00:25:14,646 --> 00:25:17,320
And you are talking
about settling down

483
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:20,159
when you should be getting down, man.
I mean, what's the big rush?

484
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:22,461
Look, we could spend eight months
planning this thing out...

485
00:25:22,488 --> 00:25:24,832
Or we could just not dwell on it
and just get married.

486
00:25:24,857 --> 00:25:27,133
Do you watch television?

487
00:25:27,159 --> 00:25:29,469
Do you know what a bridezilla is?

488
00:25:29,495 --> 00:25:30,974
I do not.

489
00:25:30,996 --> 00:25:33,738
All they want is perfect.

490
00:25:33,766 --> 00:25:35,609
Please educate me.

491
00:25:35,634 --> 00:25:38,171
They want perfect flowers

492
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:40,308
and a perfect dress

493
00:25:40,339 --> 00:25:42,410
and perfect perfectness--

494
00:25:42,441 --> 00:25:44,011
perfect perfect.

495
00:25:44,043 --> 00:25:46,922
You know what?
Perfect perfect-- we're not 25.

496
00:25:46,945 --> 00:25:49,755
We don't need
some ridiculous wedding.

497
00:25:49,782 --> 00:25:52,786
We've been through this already before,
both of us have.

498
00:25:52,818 --> 00:25:55,196
We don't need that.
We just want something simple...

499
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,221
And no nonsense...

500
00:25:56,255 --> 00:25:58,531
- Intimate...
- Little wedding.

501
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:00,400
At least let me handle the music.

502
00:26:00,426 --> 00:26:03,066
( laughs )
That's good.

503
00:26:03,095 --> 00:26:05,006
We're so good, dude.
We have our own Facebook page...

504
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:07,601
- Frank.
- ...My space page.

505
00:26:07,633 --> 00:26:10,045
We're huge in Germany.

506
00:26:10,069 --> 00:26:11,309
No.

507
00:26:11,336 --> 00:26:14,215
Come on, man.
We just played the Renaissance Faire.

508
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:16,241
And all the knights in the crowd
were like,

509
00:26:16,275 --> 00:26:19,586
"Arrrgh, thou art fine minstrels."

510
00:26:19,611 --> 00:26:22,854
But they didn't sound like pirates
when they did it.

511
00:26:22,881 --> 00:26:23,882
No.

512
00:26:23,916 --> 00:26:25,520
I'll give you a massage.

513
00:26:25,551 --> 00:26:27,189
This is a no.

514
00:26:27,219 --> 00:26:29,130
- But I love you.
- I love you too.

515
00:26:29,154 --> 00:26:31,532
This is tough love. No.

516
00:26:31,557 --> 00:26:33,298
As long as you're happy,
I will support you.

517
00:26:33,325 --> 00:26:35,965
- Thanks, Mom.
- I'm scared, but I'll support you.

518
00:26:35,994 --> 00:26:37,371
Come on.

519
00:26:37,396 --> 00:26:40,741
Don't forget, if it wasn't for me,
none of this would have happened.

520
00:26:43,902 --> 00:26:46,246
( Rusty narrating )
I may have the mental capacity

521
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:48,251
of your average
two-year-old human,

522
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:51,618
but I couldn't help but notice
that the girls weren't exactly thrilled

523
00:26:51,643 --> 00:26:54,783
with the idea that their father
was getting hitched to this woman.

524
00:26:58,584 --> 00:27:00,530
- Hi.
- Hi.

525
00:27:00,552 --> 00:27:02,896
- May I help you?
- Yes. I'm getting married.

526
00:27:02,921 --> 00:27:06,095
Congratulations.
And my goodness, what beautiful--

527
00:27:06,125 --> 00:27:08,401
- oh honey, honey.
- Swing swing.

528
00:27:08,427 --> 00:27:10,373
May I say what beautiful daughters
you have?

529
00:27:10,395 --> 00:27:12,432
Susan:
They are lovely.

530
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:16,276
Well, you are gonna make
a beautiful bride.

531
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:18,645
I mean, my goodness,
you have lovely bone structure.

532
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:21,947
And we can find something to accentuate
your gorgeous blonde hair.

533
00:27:21,974 --> 00:27:23,476
Let's try something on.

534
00:27:23,509 --> 00:27:24,647
Okay.

535
00:27:32,151 --> 00:27:34,290
You look splendid.

536
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:37,323
- I think it's a little long.
- No, it's perfect.

537
00:27:37,356 --> 00:27:39,768
You put some heels on--
just right.

538
00:27:39,792 --> 00:27:40,998
Yeah. Oh.

539
00:27:41,026 --> 00:27:43,028
- I think it's a little too long.
- Yeah.

540
00:27:43,061 --> 00:27:45,132
Well, what do you think?

541
00:27:45,164 --> 00:27:47,201
You look like Tarzan's wife.

542
00:27:47,232 --> 00:27:49,576
This is one of my
most popular designers.

543
00:27:49,601 --> 00:27:52,138
She still looks like Tarzan's wife.

544
00:27:52,171 --> 00:27:53,707
Oh.

545
00:27:53,739 --> 00:27:57,585
Saleswoman: Okay, this is
a brand-new one. It just came in today.

546
00:27:57,609 --> 00:28:01,216
Now it's floor-length,
which is a must, I think.

547
00:28:01,246 --> 00:28:05,592
It's got a corseted bodice
which shows off your figure perfectly.

548
00:28:05,617 --> 00:28:07,654
It's got full support
and a neckline

549
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:09,996
that is gonna make
that groom's heart flutter.

550
00:28:10,022 --> 00:28:14,027
- I think it's a little too sparkly.
- I like it. It's pretty cool.

551
00:28:14,059 --> 00:28:17,165
Speaking of flutter,
is this in dollars?

552
00:28:17,196 --> 00:28:21,008
Honey, you can't put a price tag
on the most important day of your life.

553
00:28:21,033 --> 00:28:23,035
Yeah, but this is
a down payment...

554
00:28:23,068 --> 00:28:24,672
- it's okay.
- ...on a house.

555
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:26,376
We don't need to go to college.

556
00:28:26,405 --> 00:28:28,783
Do you have something
on sale maybe?

557
00:28:28,807 --> 00:28:30,844
I do have some stuff
in the back.

558
00:28:30,876 --> 00:28:32,878
You're welcome to fish through.

559
00:28:32,911 --> 00:28:34,857
Follow me.

560
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,190
She shoots.

561
00:28:37,216 --> 00:28:38,752
She scores.

562
00:28:44,223 --> 00:28:47,466
Hey puppy. Hi.
Did you miss me?

563
00:28:47,493 --> 00:28:50,030
Oh, you are a good boy.

564
00:28:51,063 --> 00:28:53,566
- Hello.
- Hi sweetie.

565
00:28:53,599 --> 00:28:56,478
I made Santa sugar cookies--
your favorite.

566
00:28:56,502 --> 00:28:59,540
Oh yeah, those were my favorite
when I was, like, 10.

567
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:03,246
Oh, then I supposed it was Santa and
his elves who ate them all last year?

568
00:29:03,275 --> 00:29:06,722
Okay, maybe I had a couple.

569
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:09,089
- How did it go at the dress shop?
- It was interesting.

570
00:29:09,114 --> 00:29:10,252
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

571
00:29:10,282 --> 00:29:12,284
Okay, that's an understatement.

572
00:29:12,317 --> 00:29:14,024
And the girls?

573
00:29:14,052 --> 00:29:18,467
I think the girls are about as excited
about the wedding as the boys are.

574
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:20,492
Did you really expect otherwise?

575
00:29:20,526 --> 00:29:22,904
It's a big change for them.

576
00:29:22,928 --> 00:29:25,534
You can't expect them
to fall in love with you overnight.

577
00:29:25,564 --> 00:29:28,204
I know.

578
00:29:28,233 --> 00:29:30,770
They just want to feel
safe and secure.

579
00:29:30,802 --> 00:29:33,009
They want to know
they can count on you.

580
00:29:33,038 --> 00:29:34,449
Well, they can.

581
00:29:34,473 --> 00:29:36,419
I know, but they need
to learn that.

582
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:38,944
Right now they're just probably
feeling totally invisible,

583
00:29:38,977 --> 00:29:40,854
like they don't have a say.

584
00:29:40,879 --> 00:29:44,691
They want to be appreciated
and encouraged, you know?

585
00:29:44,716 --> 00:29:46,821
I mean, everyone works
at their own pace.

586
00:29:46,852 --> 00:29:48,957
So just give it time, sweetie.

587
00:29:48,987 --> 00:29:50,432
(Cellphone ringing )

588
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:52,628
- I'm gonna get that.
- Okay.

589
00:29:52,658 --> 00:29:55,138
- I'm just gonna--
- I guess you don't like them any more.

590
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:58,903
- Huh-uh.
- I'll do crudites, you know, tonight.

591
00:29:58,931 --> 00:30:00,410
Susan: Hello?

592
00:30:00,432 --> 00:30:02,503
Pat: So how are things
out in the boondocks?

593
00:30:02,534 --> 00:30:04,605
Fine.

594
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:07,207
Yeah? Well, I've been in the office
all day, busting my hump for you.

595
00:30:07,239 --> 00:30:10,448
And I got you an opportunity
that I think is gonna make you flip.

596
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:11,476
Oh?

597
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:14,855
Chief Curator of the New York Museum
of Contemporary Art.

598
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,154
You got nothing!

599
00:30:16,181 --> 00:30:17,421
Take that.

600
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:19,785
MOCA?

601
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:22,799
That's right.
Isn't that crazy?

602
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:25,859
- That's unbelievable.
- Yeah, it's wild, isn't it?

603
00:30:25,891 --> 00:30:28,804
The last curator took a similar position
at the Louvre.

604
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:30,670
Take that.

605
00:30:30,696 --> 00:30:32,369
And here's
the luckiest part of all:

606
00:30:32,397 --> 00:30:36,174
They're gonna be in Los Angeles
tomorrow conducting interviews.

607
00:30:36,201 --> 00:30:37,737
Wait, tomorrow?

608
00:30:37,769 --> 00:30:40,750
Tomorrow.
Isn't that crazy?

609
00:30:40,772 --> 00:30:43,184
I was able to call in some favors
and pull a few strings

610
00:30:43,208 --> 00:30:46,678
and I got you a prime 11:30 slot.
Am I good or what?

611
00:30:46,712 --> 00:30:48,851
I'll be there.

612
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:51,724
So seriously, I'm asking,
am I good or what? Just say it.

613
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:53,229
Um...

614
00:30:53,251 --> 00:30:55,060
Okay, I am personally
sending you an email...

615
00:30:56,722 --> 00:31:00,192
with all the details. Done.

616
00:31:00,225 --> 00:31:02,205
Okay, thanks.

617
00:31:03,195 --> 00:31:04,367
Wow.

618
00:31:04,396 --> 00:31:06,672
Here we go. Come on,
she's kicking your butt, tubby.

619
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:10,009
Come on.
Embarrassing. Embarrassing.

620
00:31:11,203 --> 00:31:12,409
( laughs)

621
00:31:15,006 --> 00:31:17,008
MOCA?

622
00:31:17,042 --> 00:31:19,044
Oh my--

623
00:31:28,387 --> 00:31:31,596
Oh, come on, people.

624
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:37,736
(Cellphone rings )

625
00:31:37,763 --> 00:31:40,141
Hello.

626
00:31:40,165 --> 00:31:43,112
- Hey.
- Hi.

627
00:31:43,135 --> 00:31:44,443
Where are you?

628
00:31:44,469 --> 00:31:46,949
I'm running some errands.
What's up?

629
00:31:46,972 --> 00:31:49,043
Well, I was just calling
to remind you

630
00:31:49,074 --> 00:31:50,781
about the coordinators
this afternoon.

631
00:31:50,809 --> 00:31:53,187
That was today?

632
00:31:53,211 --> 00:31:55,657
Okay, what time?

633
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,284
3:00, my office.

634
00:31:57,315 --> 00:31:59,386
You know what?
I might be a few minutes late.

635
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:01,761
I have to go pick up the kids.

636
00:32:02,788 --> 00:32:06,292
Okay. Sounds good.
I'll see you then, honey.

637
00:32:06,325 --> 00:32:08,396
Bye.

638
00:32:08,427 --> 00:32:11,203
Woman:
I'm actually very traditional.

639
00:32:11,229 --> 00:32:14,802
I was thinking
white folding chairs

640
00:32:14,833 --> 00:32:17,609
and, um--
and some white--

641
00:32:17,636 --> 00:32:20,845
um...

642
00:32:20,872 --> 00:32:22,112
( sneezes )

643
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:24,484
I'm highly allergic to dogs

644
00:32:24,509 --> 00:32:27,149
and I keep sneezing
and it makes me very sick.

645
00:32:27,179 --> 00:32:28,817
Yeah, well, I'm allergic
to your perfume.

646
00:32:28,847 --> 00:32:32,795
Now I'm gonna make your wedding
fabulicious.

647
00:32:32,818 --> 00:32:34,820
Now I was thinking
for decorations,

648
00:32:34,853 --> 00:32:37,595
it should be leopard.
Rrow!

649
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:40,762
We would have horse-drawn carriages
and runners down the aisle.

650
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:42,533
You know what?
Let's lose the horses.

651
00:32:42,561 --> 00:32:44,768
I think that sounds a little much.

652
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:46,104
Rusty might get jealous.

653
00:32:46,131 --> 00:32:47,769
Yeah, my cousin
has this great restaurant.

654
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:50,973
The meatballs there
are to die for, literally.

655
00:32:51,002 --> 00:32:52,504
Be quiet for me
one minute, please.

656
00:32:52,537 --> 00:32:54,448
I just want to feel the energy
of your dogs.

657
00:32:56,475 --> 00:32:57,476
Awkward.

658
00:32:57,509 --> 00:32:59,216
My energy is creeped out.

659
00:32:59,244 --> 00:33:03,659
We'll have a wedding scene
look like Santa's workshop.

660
00:33:03,682 --> 00:33:05,286
Oh ho ho ho!

661
00:33:05,317 --> 00:33:07,297
Well, it's on Christmas, isn't it?

662
00:33:07,319 --> 00:33:09,299
Yeah-- no.
Yeah, he's going with it.

663
00:33:09,321 --> 00:33:10,800
Ho ho ho ho ho!

664
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:12,802
Oh, at the wedding we can tell you
how to do everything.

665
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:14,531
We can do "Drop It Like it's Hot."

666
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:18,769
And then we could do booty shake,
booty shake, booty shake.

667
00:33:18,797 --> 00:33:23,337
Brownies--
brownies for all of your guests.

668
00:33:23,368 --> 00:33:25,939
I'm liking this vibe.
I really like that.

669
00:33:25,971 --> 00:33:29,145
And what's nice about hay bales
is they also double as a toothpick.

670
00:33:29,174 --> 00:33:31,814
'Cause you get that meat stuck in
there. You just need a little toothpick.

671
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:34,187
You get it out of a hay bale
and you just do-- it's perfect.

672
00:33:34,212 --> 00:33:37,659
Little elves
dancing around the tables.

673
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:39,855
Your poodle can stay
because it's hypoallergenic.

674
00:33:39,885 --> 00:33:41,831
Of course I am.

675
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:43,196
But the other dog has to go.

676
00:33:43,221 --> 00:33:45,201
Do I need to state the obvious?

677
00:33:45,223 --> 00:33:46,861
No, I don't think so.

678
00:33:46,892 --> 00:33:51,398
Your dogs" they're telling me
that they love granola.

679
00:33:51,429 --> 00:33:53,431
( laughing )

680
00:33:53,465 --> 00:33:56,071
Running man, running man,
running man, running man.

681
00:33:57,702 --> 00:34:00,342
She can do a running man
while she's coming down the aisle.

682
00:34:00,372 --> 00:34:02,249
- Like that?
- That's awesome.

683
00:34:02,274 --> 00:34:04,447
Everybody has a hootenanny
good time.

684
00:34:04,476 --> 00:34:07,252
They come on in.
They leave. They're married.

685
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:10,226
Well, maybe they don't last long,
but it doesn't matter.

686
00:34:10,248 --> 00:34:12,353
The wedding
was the most fun part of it.

687
00:34:12,384 --> 00:34:15,831
See, this is great. We're learning
about each other right now as well.

688
00:34:15,854 --> 00:34:18,130
Now if you need a preacher,
I can be your preacher.

689
00:34:18,156 --> 00:34:20,568
I got a Bible for it.
Yeah, hello.

690
00:34:20,592 --> 00:34:22,594
Wow.

691
00:34:22,627 --> 00:34:25,039
If you need a pastor--
ho ho ho--

692
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:27,441
Santa Claus is licensed
to do weddings.

693
00:34:27,465 --> 00:34:30,002
So I'm detecting a real--

694
00:34:30,035 --> 00:34:32,515
real Christmas theme here
to the wedding.

695
00:34:32,537 --> 00:34:36,451
You guys need extra security?
'Cause I know a couple guys.

696
00:34:36,474 --> 00:34:38,317
- Really? Really?
- That's good. No, that's good.

697
00:34:38,343 --> 00:34:40,619
- Well, you know.
- Really?

698
00:34:40,645 --> 00:34:43,819
I will not come to the wedding
if that dog is there.

699
00:34:43,848 --> 00:34:45,759
Okay.

700
00:34:45,784 --> 00:34:48,025
Lady, I won't come to the wedding
if you're there.

701
00:34:48,053 --> 00:34:51,330
The way we see it,
the bride should be married like a queen

702
00:34:51,356 --> 00:34:53,427
and treated like a queen--

703
00:34:53,458 --> 00:34:56,029
with the exception, of course,
of a subsequent beheading.

704
00:34:56,061 --> 00:34:58,541
Thank you.

705
00:34:58,563 --> 00:35:01,737
Lots and lots of doves
flying overhead

706
00:35:01,767 --> 00:35:03,838
during your vows.

707
00:35:03,869 --> 00:35:06,110
Can you train these doves
not to poop?

708
00:35:06,138 --> 00:35:07,776
No worries.

709
00:35:07,806 --> 00:35:09,473
Yeah.

710
00:35:09,474 --> 00:35:09,815


711
00:35:18,283 --> 00:35:21,093
( Rusty narrating )
Aside from the hippies and the yogis,

712
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:23,258
I would say that went pretty well.

713
00:35:23,288 --> 00:35:25,359
Personally I'd go
with the Santa Claus guy,

714
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:27,666
because that way there'd be
presents at your wedding.

715
00:35:27,692 --> 00:35:31,367
I know someone at the dog park-- Pepe.
He could probably be an officiant

716
00:35:31,396 --> 00:35:34,536
at your wedding, but I'd have to see
if his papers are in order.

717
00:35:34,566 --> 00:35:37,308
Well, this is where we live.

718
00:35:55,253 --> 00:35:58,097
Hey. Are you too busy
to give your mom a kiss?

719
00:35:58,123 --> 00:35:59,363
How was school?

720
00:35:59,391 --> 00:36:01,496
Fine. I'm learning how to make
Emeril's fish soup.

721
00:36:01,526 --> 00:36:03,199
I need to get
the spice portions correct.

722
00:36:03,228 --> 00:36:05,037
Mm-hmm.

723
00:36:05,063 --> 00:36:08,067
- Can I make it for dinner tonight?
- You know, you have homework.

724
00:36:08,099 --> 00:36:10,636
- But Mom.
- Sorry, it's a school night

725
00:36:10,669 --> 00:36:12,671
and you need to get ready for bed

726
00:36:12,704 --> 00:36:15,378
so we have time for your
multiplication before, okay?

727
00:36:18,210 --> 00:36:19,746
You left early this morning.

728
00:36:19,778 --> 00:36:23,385
Oh yeah. I had some errands to run
before it got too late.

729
00:36:23,415 --> 00:36:25,292
How were the coordinators?

730
00:36:25,317 --> 00:36:27,661
You know, I think we're gonna end up
doing it ourselves.

731
00:36:27,686 --> 00:36:29,563
Well, it's your wedding.

732
00:36:29,588 --> 00:36:32,967
I saw your letter
about the rent.

733
00:36:32,991 --> 00:36:34,800
Oh, don't worry about that.

734
00:36:34,826 --> 00:36:36,897
Of course I'm gonna worry
about it, Mom.

735
00:36:36,928 --> 00:36:39,966
You said things were bad, but you
didn't say they were this severe.

736
00:36:39,998 --> 00:36:42,274
Things have been a little hard
since your father died,

737
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:44,906
but I'll be fine.
Do not worry about it, okay?

738
00:36:44,936 --> 00:36:46,813
Okay.

739
00:36:46,838 --> 00:36:48,340
Where's Ryan?

740
00:36:48,373 --> 00:36:49,977
He's over there.

741
00:36:50,008 --> 00:36:52,511
I caught him looking through
Paul's things earlier today.

742
00:36:52,544 --> 00:36:55,650
You go on upstairs and rest.
I'll make dinner.

743
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,852
Okay.

744
00:36:58,683 --> 00:37:00,685
Hey, buddy.

745
00:37:03,688 --> 00:37:06,100
You all right?

746
00:37:06,124 --> 00:37:09,469
How was it today?
Did you play soccer at lunch?

747
00:37:11,629 --> 00:37:13,870
-( Boys chattering )
- Where are you guys going?

748
00:37:16,167 --> 00:37:18,773
- I don't have it.
- Josh.

749
00:37:23,708 --> 00:37:26,245
( Rusty narrating ) So while the idea
of a Christmas wedding day

750
00:37:26,277 --> 00:37:28,154
might have sounded
fun and special,

751
00:37:28,179 --> 00:37:31,592
they were about to learn it presented
one teensy little problem.

752
00:37:31,616 --> 00:37:33,994
Susan: I heard back from
the Congregational Church,

753
00:37:34,019 --> 00:37:35,828
the Baptist Church
and the Presbyterians.

754
00:37:35,854 --> 00:37:38,960
They're all busy with their Christmas
services and the restaurants are closed.

755
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:41,470
- Jake: Something's got to be open.
- Yeah, there is--

756
00:37:41,493 --> 00:37:43,666
Chang's House
of Dim Sum and Donuts.

757
00:37:43,695 --> 00:37:46,073
- Oh, I love their shrimp toast.
- Rusty: I love their crullers.

758
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:47,974
Jake:
So this is our only option?

759
00:37:47,999 --> 00:37:50,343
Susan: Yeah, and for $150
it'd better be a good one.

760
00:37:50,368 --> 00:37:52,974
- Jake: Ay-yi-yi.
- Woman: No no no no no no.

761
00:37:53,004 --> 00:37:56,474
No no no. No dogs allowed.

762
00:37:56,508 --> 00:37:58,419
Oh, we have an appointment.

763
00:37:58,443 --> 00:38:00,889
Jake Campbell and Susan Davis.

764
00:38:00,912 --> 00:38:03,324
- We had an appointment with Howard?
- Hank.

765
00:38:03,348 --> 00:38:05,225
Hillary Spaulding.

766
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:08,390
And no animals are allowed
on the premises.

767
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:10,331
Rusty:
No dogs? Ouch.

768
00:38:10,355 --> 00:38:11,629
Oh.

769
00:38:11,656 --> 00:38:13,329
I assure you
they'll be well-behaved.

770
00:38:13,358 --> 00:38:16,305
Rusty:
Clearly this lady does not know us.

771
00:38:16,327 --> 00:38:19,536
( laughs )Yes, I know.
That's what they all say.

772
00:38:19,564 --> 00:38:22,010
But I know what you're thinking.

773
00:38:22,033 --> 00:38:26,504
You're thinking, "I can leave
a nice little present on the fairway."

774
00:38:26,538 --> 00:38:29,417
Yeah, too late.

775
00:38:29,441 --> 00:38:32,479
And won't the greens keeper
just love that?

776
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:36,151
We were actually hoping that the dogs
could participate in the ceremony.

777
00:38:36,181 --> 00:38:38,183
Yes. See,
they're the reason we met.

778
00:38:38,216 --> 00:38:40,628
So no dogs" no ceremony.

779
00:38:40,652 --> 00:38:43,826
Jake:
No $150 a plate.

780
00:38:43,855 --> 00:38:45,801
( Chuckles )

781
00:38:45,824 --> 00:38:50,398
Well, then welcome
to the Los Olives Country Club.

782
00:38:51,930 --> 00:38:53,773
Jake:
Pleasure.

783
00:38:53,798 --> 00:38:56,802
If it's a nice, quiet, romantic ceremony
that you're looking for,

784
00:38:56,835 --> 00:38:58,837
I believe you've come
to the right place.

785
00:38:58,870 --> 00:39:00,577
But let me show you
some options.

786
00:39:00,605 --> 00:39:03,518
I'll get another golf cart over there.
After you.

787
00:39:03,541 --> 00:39:05,521
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

788
00:39:05,543 --> 00:39:08,046
And if you lift a leg, you're done.

789
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:10,582
I think this lady needs a few days
in obedience school.

790
00:39:20,458 --> 00:39:23,234
I really think you're gonna love
the facilities, yes.

791
00:39:23,261 --> 00:39:25,935
The banquet facilities
are world class.

792
00:39:25,964 --> 00:39:29,673
Our chef is world-renowned.
And you're gonna love the catering.

793
00:39:29,701 --> 00:39:31,442
Hey, Rust,

794
00:39:31,469 --> 00:39:33,506
what are you--

795
00:39:33,538 --> 00:39:36,041
what are you thinking of me
hitching up with your mom?

796
00:39:36,074 --> 00:39:38,111
Is that all right?

797
00:39:38,143 --> 00:39:39,816
Oh, there's a bridal suite too,

798
00:39:39,844 --> 00:39:41,824
if you need to get ready beforehand.
It's fabulous.

799
00:39:41,846 --> 00:39:43,587
It's so pretty.
Isn't it pretty, honey?

800
00:39:43,615 --> 00:39:45,492
Yeah, it's gorgeous.

801
00:39:45,517 --> 00:39:49,021
No, you're not gonna see
anything like it for miles around,

802
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:50,691
I assure you.

803
00:39:50,722 --> 00:39:52,861
Rusty:
Oh my, is that what I think it is?

804
00:39:52,891 --> 00:39:55,428
Cheri:
Ignore him, Rusty. He's just a stray.

805
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:57,770
Rusty:
it's another dog! Let's get him!

806
00:39:57,796 --> 00:39:59,673
- Cheri: Rusty, no. Get back here.
- Jake: Whoa whoa whoa.

807
00:39:59,697 --> 00:40:01,677
- Oh.
- Oh.

808
00:40:05,603 --> 00:40:07,549
Why are you guys chasing me?

809
00:40:07,572 --> 00:40:09,643
Rusty:
Just get him.

810
00:40:09,674 --> 00:40:11,449
Cheri:
Hey.

811
00:40:11,476 --> 00:40:13,547
- Dog: No!
- Cheri: Guys, wait up.

812
00:40:18,783 --> 00:40:20,592
Rusty:
Now I got you.

813
00:40:20,618 --> 00:40:23,360
- Dog: Aha! Now I'm gonna chase you.
- Rusty: Don't chase me.

814
00:40:26,458 --> 00:40:28,699
Cheri:
Rusty, listen to me. Stop it.

815
00:40:28,726 --> 00:40:30,637
I'm gonna get you.

816
00:40:30,662 --> 00:40:32,573
I'm gonna get-- whoa!

817
00:40:36,067 --> 00:40:38,445
(Screaming )

818
00:40:41,639 --> 00:40:43,880
Jake:
I know. Goodness.

819
00:40:43,908 --> 00:40:46,047
- You guys both go sit.
- Okay, just go.

820
00:40:46,077 --> 00:40:47,385
- Sit down.
- Stay.

821
00:40:47,412 --> 00:40:49,517
- Relax. We'll talk to you later.
- ( chuckles )

822
00:40:49,547 --> 00:40:52,118
I can't believe she's gonna let us
have the event at the country club

823
00:40:52,150 --> 00:40:54,630
- after all that. That was madness.
- I know. I know.

824
00:40:54,652 --> 00:40:56,495
Wow, there's nobody here.

825
00:40:56,521 --> 00:40:59,900
- Is it always this quiet?
- Yeah, it's a ghost town.

826
00:40:59,924 --> 00:41:02,200
I remember when my mom and dad
opened this place,

827
00:41:02,227 --> 00:41:04,366
there were antique stores
up and down the street.

828
00:41:04,395 --> 00:41:05,931
Now they're all tasting rooms.

829
00:41:05,964 --> 00:41:09,309
- Oh. We're the enemy?
- Mm-hmm.

830
00:41:09,334 --> 00:41:11,041
- Susan: Look out.
- Jake: Hi.

831
00:41:11,069 --> 00:41:12,946
Susan:
Crazy lady carrying blankets.

832
00:41:12,971 --> 00:41:15,679
She's behind on her rent.

833
00:41:15,707 --> 00:41:17,653
- She's cuckoo.
- Is she really?

834
00:41:17,675 --> 00:41:19,916
I don't know how much longer
she can keep this place going.

835
00:41:19,944 --> 00:41:22,151
You just gotta figure out
how to get some butts in this place.

836
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:25,787
How do you do that?
I have no idea how to sell antiques.

837
00:41:25,817 --> 00:41:29,959
Well, then why don't we get them in here
some way you do know,

838
00:41:29,988 --> 00:41:32,798
I don't know, like--

839
00:41:32,824 --> 00:41:35,270
- oh.
- What? What oh?

840
00:41:36,995 --> 00:41:38,975
Do something you know.

841
00:41:38,997 --> 00:41:41,603
Do something

842
00:41:41,633 --> 00:41:43,476
you love.

843
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:45,447
You are a genius.

844
00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:47,006
Do something with Christmas.

845
00:41:47,038 --> 00:41:49,382
- That is a great idea.
- Oh, heads up. Heads up. Oh.

846
00:41:49,407 --> 00:41:50,613
- Oh. hi.
- Hi.

847
00:41:50,642 --> 00:41:52,519
Oh, sorry. Hi.
I didn't know you guys were here.

848
00:41:52,543 --> 00:41:54,113
Hey, do you need a hand?

No.

That day they got to work on a plan

852
00:42:01,252 --> 00:42:03,289
to grab the tourists' attention.

853
00:42:04,789 --> 00:42:07,133
The new family came together
and chipped in

Having sampled the highlights

902
00:44:44,082 --> 00:44:46,756
of the Los Olives indie music scene,
it was time to move on

903
00:44:46,784 --> 00:44:48,786
to the next element
of the wedding.

904
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:51,357
And after her delightful picnic
with the Campbell girls,

905
00:44:51,389 --> 00:44:53,869
Susan thought it might be
a good idea for her boys

906
00:44:53,891 --> 00:44:56,064

some cake, Whoo-hoo!

get out of this car right now.

Okay, come on.

are staying in here

913
00:45:11,676 --> 00:45:13,678
until we're ready to go.

914
00:45:13,711 --> 00:45:16,157
And if you're good,
I'll get you a treat on the way back.

915
00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:19,593
( Rusty narrating ) I had to admit, more
and more I was really liking this guy.

916
00:45:19,617 --> 00:45:24,157
Ryan, don't you want to come
see some wedding cakes, honey?

917
00:45:26,190 --> 00:45:28,192
Okay.

918
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:31,697
Jake:
Let me handle this.

919
00:45:42,773 --> 00:45:44,047
Hey, buddy.

920
00:45:44,075 --> 00:45:47,887
So you're not so thrilled about
your mom and I getting engaged, huh?

921
00:45:49,781 --> 00:45:53,126
I get it. I think my daughters
would agree with you.

922
00:45:54,652 --> 00:45:57,758
And I know that you're
missing your dad. Right?

923
00:46:00,391 --> 00:46:02,769
I want you to know
I miss someone a lot too.

924
00:46:03,828 --> 00:46:07,776
Madison and Emma's mama
was a really special lady

925
00:46:07,799 --> 00:46:09,745
and I miss her a lot.

926
00:46:09,767 --> 00:46:12,771
I really do.
But your dad--

927
00:46:12,804 --> 00:46:15,410
I'm not trying to replace him.

928
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:17,851
I couldn't.

929
00:46:17,875 --> 00:46:20,185
It'd be impossible.

930
00:46:20,211 --> 00:46:23,055
What I can do

931
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:24,753
is I can help him.

932
00:46:24,782 --> 00:46:28,127
I can help him take care of you,

933
00:46:28,152 --> 00:46:30,462
take care of your brothers

934
00:46:30,488 --> 00:46:34,197
and help look after your mom
a little bit.

935
00:46:38,896 --> 00:46:43,072
And one thing
I'll guarantee you

936
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:44,943
is that I won't leave you.

937
00:46:44,969 --> 00:46:48,280
He said that too.

938
00:46:48,306 --> 00:46:51,287
Hey.

00:46:52,643 --> 00:46:55,283

What do you think?

00:47:23,307 --> 00:47:28,188
My heart cries out for the piece
of fondant on display here.

- He is nine, isn't he?
- Yeah.

How can I help you?

951

Good. We're getting married.

952
00:47:34,919 --> 00:47:38,196
Congratulations. Have you thought about
what kind of cake you might like?

953
00:47:38,222 --> 00:47:40,224
Both: Not really.

954
00:47:40,258 --> 00:47:42,670
I mean, we're here.
It's about as far as we've gotten.

955
00:47:42,693 --> 00:47:44,070
Flavors?

956
00:47:44,095 --> 00:47:46,234
- I was thinking angel food.
- Like a red velvet.

957
00:47:46,264 --> 00:47:49,108
- Okay, lemon coconut.
- Raspberry cream.

958
00:47:49,133 --> 00:47:51,010
Susan: Or--

959
00:47:51,035 --> 00:47:53,174
Or lemon raspberry
coconut cream.

960
00:47:53,204 --> 00:47:54,740
Okay, I think we have
some work to do.

961
00:47:54,772 --> 00:47:56,410
Why don't I go get us
some books to look at?

962
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:59,512
Thank you. Good. All right, we're gonna
rock-paper-scissors for this.

963
00:47:59,543 --> 00:48:01,420
- All right, you're on.
- Red velvet. What are you?

964
00:48:01,445 --> 00:48:03,391
Um, lemon.

965
00:48:03,414 --> 00:48:06,293
- Cheri: Hey, where are you going?
- I smell something.

966
00:48:06,317 --> 00:48:08,319
Cheri: Can't you just
wait patiently?

967
00:48:08,352 --> 00:48:11,299
Rusty: Hold on.
Is that--

968
00:48:11,322 --> 00:48:14,098
is that-- is that tiramisu

969
00:48:14,125 --> 00:48:15,695
or a cappuccino torte?

970
00:48:15,726 --> 00:48:18,297
Cheri: You are going to get us
in so much trouble.

971
00:48:19,330 --> 00:48:23,039
- Jake: Is it gonna look good?
- Susan: Or taste good.

972
00:48:23,067 --> 00:48:26,378
All right, here we go.
Here are some samples for you.

973
00:48:26,404 --> 00:48:29,442
Now I'd like to explain
each of these in detail, if I may.

974
00:48:29,473 --> 00:48:32,113
First of all, we have the--
oh, not--

Just wait.
Wait wait just a second.

976

Okay, this is the sour cream fudge
with swirled marble.

977
00:48:37,815 --> 00:48:41,092
I find the sour cream fudge
particularly playful.

Food Network.

979
00:48:43,254 --> 00:48:46,133
We have the vanilla
French butter cream.

980

and let me explain.

be a helpful--

- Right. I just want--

Cheri: Rusty, get back here.

986
00:49:01,839 --> 00:49:04,979
Rusty: I just want to get a closer look.
Maybe they got samples in the dumpster.

987
00:49:05,009 --> 00:49:07,751
Cheri:
Oh, that's disgusting. Come on.

988
00:49:07,778 --> 00:49:10,349
Rusty: isn't that the most
beautiful thing

989
00:49:10,381 --> 00:49:12,258
you've ever seen
in your whole life?

990
00:49:12,283 --> 00:49:13,455
Cheri: You're only three.

991

Rusty: Yeah, but that's 21
in dog years.

- Cheri: Rusty!

995
00:49:23,594 --> 00:49:26,165
What was that?

00:49:28,332 --> 00:49:30,778
Rusty:
Oh gosh, that's so good.

997
00:49:33,004 --> 00:49:35,177
What was that?

998
00:49:35,206 --> 00:49:38,415
What is-- what is--

999
00:49:38,442 --> 00:49:40,183
what is going on?!

1000
00:49:40,211 --> 00:49:41,952
What?

1001
00:49:41,979 --> 00:49:45,085
How did you get in here?!

1002
00:49:45,116 --> 00:49:48,461
You get out of here!
Get out of my bakery!

1003
00:49:48,485 --> 00:49:50,965
Get out of here, you!

1004
00:49:50,988 --> 00:49:52,990
Argh!

1005
00:49:54,158 --> 00:49:58,072
Furry, mangy, pile of fleas,
you get back here!

1006
00:50:01,465 --> 00:50:03,638
Are those your animals?

1007
00:50:04,669 --> 00:50:07,275
Do you have any idea

1008
00:50:07,304 --> 00:50:09,409
what they have done
to my kitchen,

1009
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:12,709
to my cake?
They've ruined a $2500 cake!

1010
00:50:12,710 --> 00:50:13,051


1011
00:50:19,216 --> 00:50:21,218
Okay,

1012
00:50:21,252 --> 00:50:23,892
you get to go upstairs
and go to bed.

1013
00:50:23,921 --> 00:50:26,458
Go to bed.

1014
00:50:26,490 --> 00:50:29,403
Hi. Everything okay?

1015
00:50:29,427 --> 00:50:31,600
Oh yeah, other than the fact

1016
00:50:31,629 --> 00:50:34,269
that Rusty ran through the kitchen
of the bakery

1017
00:50:34,298 --> 00:50:37,211
and destroyed everything,
everything is great.

1018
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:45,113
Hey, it's Pat again.

1019
00:50:45,142 --> 00:50:48,351
I have some fantastic news.
Call me immediate--

1020
00:50:48,379 --> 00:50:50,188
( phone rings )

1021
00:50:50,214 --> 00:50:52,694
- Pat Blake.
- Hey, it's Susan.

1022
00:50:52,717 --> 00:50:54,355
Susan, what have you
been doing?

1023
00:50:54,385 --> 00:50:56,763
I've been waiting here in my office
all day for you to call me back.

1024
00:50:56,787 --> 00:50:59,233
I was out walking the dog.

1025
00:50:59,256 --> 00:51:02,260
I thought you'd like to know that
I had a very interesting conversation

1026
00:51:02,293 --> 00:51:04,330
with Mr. Bob Martinez
over at MOCA.

1027
00:51:04,361 --> 00:51:06,466
And?

1028
00:51:06,497 --> 00:51:08,170
Are you sitting down?

1029
00:51:09,867 --> 00:51:11,175
I am.

1030
00:51:11,202 --> 00:51:13,580
- You got the position!
- You're kidding me.

1031
00:51:13,604 --> 00:51:16,551
No. He said you're by far
the best candidate for the job.

1032
00:51:16,574 --> 00:51:19,145
That's incredible. I--

1033
00:51:19,176 --> 00:51:21,349
Chief Curator, New York City.

1034
00:51:21,378 --> 00:51:23,449
It's exactly what you wanted.

1035
00:51:23,481 --> 00:51:25,483
Yeah, I don't know what to say.

1036
00:51:25,516 --> 00:51:27,393
How about "Yeah"?
How about, "You're amazing, Pat.

1037
00:51:27,418 --> 00:51:29,193
And nobody else could have
done this for me, Pat."

1038
00:51:29,220 --> 00:51:31,291
Listen, they're sending
the contract over right now.

1039
00:51:31,322 --> 00:51:32,926
I'm gonna have the lawyers
take a peek at it.

1040
00:51:32,957 --> 00:51:35,494
All I need from you is a commitment
to start on the 1st.

1041
00:51:35,526 --> 00:51:37,836
I'll even book your flight out
on the 26th.

1042
00:51:37,861 --> 00:51:40,341
Oh, that's the day
after Christmas.

1043
00:51:40,364 --> 00:51:43,709
Well, you want time to get settled
or organized or whatever you do.

1044
00:51:43,734 --> 00:51:45,577
The kids probably need
a school to go to.

1045
00:51:45,603 --> 00:51:47,640
Right, yeah.
Of course.

1046
00:51:47,671 --> 00:51:49,810
What's the big deal?

1047
00:51:51,709 --> 00:51:54,053
It's just it's short notice is all.

1048
00:51:54,078 --> 00:51:56,456
Well, when you live life
in the fast lane like you are, Susan,

1049
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:57,891
you gotta hold on tight.

1050
00:51:57,915 --> 00:51:59,952
This is exactly
what you've been waiting for.

1051
00:51:59,984 --> 00:52:03,090
I want to hear a celebration.
I want to hear excitement.

1052
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:05,157
I want to hear jumping for joy.
Are you even jumping?

1053
00:52:05,189 --> 00:52:07,191
No, I am.

1054
00:52:07,224 --> 00:52:11,138
Here's the thing, Pat:
I've met someone.

1055
00:52:11,161 --> 00:52:14,768
Actually I've more than met someone.
I'm engaged to be married.

1056
00:52:14,798 --> 00:52:18,371
What? Why'd you go and do
something silly like that for?

1057
00:52:18,402 --> 00:52:20,143
Yeah, it just happened

1058
00:52:20,170 --> 00:52:22,275
on Thanksgiving.

1059
00:52:22,306 --> 00:52:24,411
We are going to be
getting married

1060
00:52:24,441 --> 00:52:26,751
on December 25th.

1061
00:52:26,777 --> 00:52:28,552
Listen, can I give you a little
piece of advice?

1062
00:52:28,579 --> 00:52:30,525
Because I've been married
four and a half times.

1063
00:52:30,548 --> 00:52:32,391
- Half?
- It was an annulment.

1064
00:52:32,416 --> 00:52:34,589
It was a stupid Vegas thing.
Whatever.

1065
00:52:34,618 --> 00:52:37,724
I know a thing or two about marriage.
Listen to me.

1066
00:52:37,755 --> 00:52:40,668
This whirlwind-romance-
spur-of-the-moment stuff

1067
00:52:40,691 --> 00:52:43,672
is fake. it's not real.
It doesn't exist.

1068
00:52:43,694 --> 00:52:45,731
It's a movie.
Do you understand?

1069
00:52:45,763 --> 00:52:48,437
It feels pretty real to me.

1070
00:52:48,466 --> 00:52:50,878
Fine. Then get married
to Mr. Mayberry

1071
00:52:50,901 --> 00:52:52,972
and spend the rest of your life
living in a small town

1072
00:52:53,003 --> 00:52:55,711
working at your mom's shop, because
that's what you're gonna be doing

1073
00:52:55,740 --> 00:52:57,913
if you marry this guy.
That's gonna be your life.

1074
00:52:57,941 --> 00:53:01,081
Or go to New York City,
the job of your dreams--

1075
00:53:01,111 --> 00:53:04,149
running the second-biggest
art museum on the East Coast.

1076
00:53:04,181 --> 00:53:05,751
You deserve this position.

1077
00:53:05,783 --> 00:53:08,059
And I would hate to see it go
to somebody else, Susan.

1078
00:53:08,085 --> 00:53:11,294
I know. Yeah.

1079
00:53:11,322 --> 00:53:15,293
Listen, give me 24 hours
to think about it, okay?

1080
00:53:15,326 --> 00:53:17,306
You got 12.

1081
00:53:28,505 --> 00:53:30,416
Marriage.

1082
00:53:32,142 --> 00:53:34,486
Disgusting.

1083
00:53:34,511 --> 00:53:37,219
You know, you were made
for that job.

1084
00:53:54,331 --> 00:53:56,777
Yeah, you can tell him
that I'll give him another 5% off,

1085
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:59,041
but tell him that I know
that he knows that I know

1086
00:53:59,069 --> 00:54:02,107
that he's already getting a good deal.
( laughs )

1087
00:54:02,139 --> 00:54:04,881
Yeah, you guys are
our best customers.

1088
00:54:04,909 --> 00:54:07,515
Don't worry about it.

1089
00:54:07,544 --> 00:54:10,320
Hey, let me call you back.

1090
00:54:18,655 --> 00:54:20,532
To what do I owe the pleasure?

1091
00:54:20,557 --> 00:54:23,197
Welcome.

1092
00:54:24,595 --> 00:54:26,973
- How's Rusty?
- Grounded.

1093
00:54:26,997 --> 00:54:28,806
Jake:
I'll bet.

1094
00:54:28,832 --> 00:54:30,778
Susan:
Can we talk for a minute?

1095
00:54:30,801 --> 00:54:32,610
Jake:
Sure, yeah.

1096
00:54:32,636 --> 00:54:34,638
Let's go inside.
It's getting chilly out here.

1097
00:54:39,510 --> 00:54:41,251
New York?

1098
00:54:41,278 --> 00:54:44,122
Yeah. I've been wanting
something like this.

1099
00:54:44,148 --> 00:54:46,856
It's a tremendous opportunity.

1100
00:54:46,884 --> 00:54:51,355
MOCA is one of the biggest museums
in the country.

1101
00:54:51,388 --> 00:54:53,095
How did they find you?

1102
00:54:53,123 --> 00:54:55,262
I mean, who hires someone
without an interview?

1103
00:54:57,461 --> 00:54:59,463
- You interviewed.
- I did.

1104
00:54:59,496 --> 00:55:02,170
It was the day that we met
with the coordinators.

1105
00:55:02,199 --> 00:55:05,408
L-- they were in LA
and I went down.

1106
00:55:05,436 --> 00:55:07,074
You went down to LA
for an interview?

1107
00:55:07,104 --> 00:55:08,913
I didn't think anything
would come of it.

1108
00:55:08,939 --> 00:55:10,816
- And you didn't tell me?
- No, I didn't--

1109
00:55:10,841 --> 00:55:12,878
I didn't want to worry you.
I didn't--

1110
00:55:12,910 --> 00:55:16,084
Oh yeah, so you just lied about it.
That's so much better.

1111
00:55:16,113 --> 00:55:18,491
Okay, wait, did you never think
that I was gonna work again?

1112
00:55:18,515 --> 00:55:21,359
Of course not, but I thought these were
the kinds of things we could discuss...

1113
00:55:21,385 --> 00:55:23,331
- Yes, we are.
- ...that we could be open about them.

1114
00:55:23,353 --> 00:55:25,390
That's what I'm doing.
I'm here talking to you about it.

1115
00:55:25,422 --> 00:55:26,992
I want you to come to New York
with me.

1116
00:55:27,024 --> 00:55:30,198
I can't just leave here.
This is the only home that my kids know.

1117
00:55:30,227 --> 00:55:32,229
Their friends are here.
Their school is here.

1118
00:55:32,263 --> 00:55:35,301
I understand, but they can make
new friends. That's what kids do.

1119
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:39,940
This place has been in my family
for 40 years--

1120
00:55:39,970 --> 00:55:41,972
40 yea rs.

1121
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:48,046
There's nothing
more important than family.

1122
00:55:48,078 --> 00:55:50,149
And besides, I thought
we had a good thing here.

1123
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:52,023
What about your mom's store?
What about that?

1124
00:55:52,049 --> 00:55:54,495
'Cause she took pity on me
and gave me a place to live?

1125
00:55:54,518 --> 00:55:57,431
I mean, I have worked
my entire life, Jake,

1126
00:55:57,454 --> 00:55:59,456
ever since I graduated
from high school.

1127
00:55:59,490 --> 00:56:02,403
I put myself through college.
I got two master's degrees--

1128
00:56:02,426 --> 00:56:04,838
to end up here?

1129
00:56:04,862 --> 00:56:08,002
This is not me. This was never meant
to be permanent for me.

1130
00:56:08,031 --> 00:56:10,841
I am not a small-town person.

1131
00:56:10,868 --> 00:56:13,041
You have this. You have the winery.
What do I have?

1132
00:56:13,070 --> 00:56:17,416
What defines me
other than mom?

1133
00:56:19,643 --> 00:56:21,589
Wife?

1134
00:56:24,014 --> 00:56:26,858
I didn't mean that.
Jake--

1135
00:56:26,884 --> 00:56:29,296
No, I know exactly
what you mean.

1136
00:56:31,722 --> 00:56:34,862
You know, when I told everyone
that I wanted to marry you, they said,

1137
00:56:34,892 --> 00:56:36,894
"Slow down.
You're moving too fast.

1138
00:56:36,927 --> 00:56:39,305
You don't know her
well enough."

1139
00:56:40,664 --> 00:56:43,736
And I told them
I knew exactly who you were

1140
00:56:43,767 --> 00:56:46,475
and that you were exactly
the person I've been looking for

1141
00:56:46,503 --> 00:56:48,505
since my wife died.

1142
00:56:48,538 --> 00:56:50,540
I guess I didn't know you at all.

1143
00:56:50,574 --> 00:56:52,212
Jake.

1144
00:56:52,242 --> 00:56:54,313
You know, I'm just gonna
go back to this place

1145
00:56:54,344 --> 00:56:56,790
that can do without me, okay?

1146
00:57:10,427 --> 00:57:15,240
♪ You can't control ♪

1147
00:57:15,265 --> 00:57:18,940

1151
00:57:27,578 --> 00:57:30,525
( Rusty narrating )
Unfortunately, no one knew what to do,

1152
00:57:30,547 --> 00:57:33,926
but they couldn't shake the feeling
that they'd rushed into this

1153
00:57:33,951 --> 00:57:36,295
and maybe it was a mistake.

1154
00:57:37,921 --> 00:57:40,026
I worked my whole life
for this job, you know?

1155
00:57:40,057 --> 00:57:42,059
I know you did, baby.

1156
00:57:43,093 --> 00:57:45,369
You'd think he'd be
more understanding.

1157
00:57:45,395 --> 00:57:48,103
Frank: I hate to say it,
but I told you so.

1158
00:57:48,131 --> 00:57:49,769
Jake:
I know. I know.

1159
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:51,643
Frank: it's like when we make
a bottle of wine.

1160
00:57:51,668 --> 00:57:54,046
First you've got to cultivate
and grow the grapes.

1161
00:57:54,071 --> 00:57:56,051
Then you've got to check
the sugar content to make sure

1162
00:57:56,073 --> 00:57:58,713
you're harvesting them at
the right time. Then you ferment them.

1163
00:57:58,742 --> 00:58:01,222
You age it for months,
and then you bottle it.

1164
00:58:01,245 --> 00:58:04,692
You'd think maybe he would see
what a great opportunity this is.

1165
00:58:04,715 --> 00:58:07,525
Well, he lives here.
His kids' home is here.

1166
00:58:07,551 --> 00:58:09,724
And then, and only then,

1167
00:58:09,753 --> 00:58:12,131
you know you have
the perfect bottle of wine.

1168
00:58:12,156 --> 00:58:14,295
I thought
I had the perfect bottle.

1169
00:58:14,324 --> 00:58:16,395
Have you thought about staying?

1170
00:58:16,426 --> 00:58:18,428
Of course, but--

1171
00:58:18,462 --> 00:58:20,339
But what?

1172
00:58:20,364 --> 00:58:21,809
It's good money, Mom.

1173
00:58:21,832 --> 00:58:24,278
If I took this job,
I wouldn't have to worry any more.

1174
00:58:24,301 --> 00:58:26,042
Well, it sounds like
you've made up your mind.

1175
00:58:26,069 --> 00:58:28,811
It's not my decision.
She's the one leaving.

1176
00:58:30,874 --> 00:58:32,376
Have you told her
how you feel?

1177
00:58:32,409 --> 00:58:35,447
Of course I have.
I want him to come.

1178
00:58:35,479 --> 00:58:37,481
I haven't been this happy
in a long time,

1179
00:58:37,514 --> 00:58:40,188
but I can't just pack up
and leave all this to go out East.

1180
00:58:41,919 --> 00:58:43,990
I'm not gonna do it, Frank.

1181
00:58:44,021 --> 00:58:45,329
I can't.

1182
00:58:45,355 --> 00:58:47,357
I'm gonna call Pat.

1183
00:58:47,391 --> 00:58:49,735

( Rusty narrating )
It really hurt to see her like this.

1223
01:01:05,028 --> 01:01:06,974
I knew how much
Jake meant to her.

1224
01:01:06,997 --> 01:01:11,139
I also knew how she felt, having to
move back in with her mom at that age.

1225
01:01:11,168 --> 01:01:15,207
Independence is important.
But she wasn't the only one upset.

1226
01:01:16,206 --> 01:01:18,846
( Sighs )

1227
01:01:20,544 --> 01:01:22,490
I know.

1228
01:01:22,512 --> 01:01:25,550
Jake: I don't know
what we're gonna do.

1229
01:01:30,487 --> 01:01:32,990
- Hey, Daddy.
- Hello.

1230
01:01:33,023 --> 01:01:35,469
Love you.
Hey, sweetheart.

1231
01:01:35,492 --> 01:01:37,062
- Daddy.
- Yeah?

1232
01:01:37,093 --> 01:01:39,573
What's gonna happen to Susan?

1233
01:01:40,964 --> 01:01:43,410
Mm, have a seat.

1234
01:01:43,433 --> 01:01:45,777
Let me talk to you guys
for a second.

1235
01:01:49,706 --> 01:01:54,314
So Susan got a really nice
job opportunity

1236
01:01:54,344 --> 01:01:56,654
and she's moving
to New York.

1237
01:01:56,680 --> 01:01:59,854
Why does she have
to leave?

1238
01:01:59,883 --> 01:02:02,762
It's complicated,
honey.

1239
01:02:02,786 --> 01:02:04,527
I thought she wanted
to be our mommy.

1240
01:02:06,223 --> 01:02:08,829
I didn't know that it mattered
so much to you two.

1241
01:02:08,858 --> 01:02:12,101
It did to you.
And we want you to be happy.

1242
01:02:12,128 --> 01:02:15,302
And now Cheri doesn't have
Rusty any more.

1243
01:02:15,332 --> 01:02:17,369
Madison: See?

1244
01:02:18,935 --> 01:02:21,108
Hmm.

1245
01:02:23,707 --> 01:02:26,847
Come here, give me a hug.

1246
01:02:26,877 --> 01:02:29,756
- Love you guys.
- Madison: Love you, Daddy.

1247
01:02:29,779 --> 01:02:31,781
Jake:
We're gonna be okay.

1248
01:02:31,815 --> 01:02:33,954
- Yeah, you too, come here, girl.
- Yeah, come here.

1249
01:02:33,984 --> 01:02:36,464
- Come on, honey. Yeah.
- Good girl.

1250
01:02:41,925 --> 01:02:43,927
( Rusty narrating )
We had five days left,

1251
01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:46,133
and there
wasn't a moment to lose.

1252
01:02:46,163 --> 01:02:48,165
Cheri and I had to come up
with a plan,

1253
01:02:48,198 --> 01:02:50,474
and fast.

1254
01:02:53,103 --> 01:02:56,482
( Rusty barking )

1255
01:02:56,506 --> 01:02:58,850
- Ryan: Rusty.
- Logan: Come on, Rusty.

1256
01:02:58,875 --> 01:03:00,912
Josh: Come on, Rusty,
stop playing around.

1257
01:03:02,245 --> 01:03:04,418
- Stop playing around.
- Rusty, come back!

1258
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:07,087
- Mom's gonna kill us.
- Not if we catch him first.

1259
01:03:07,117 --> 01:03:10,223
Rusty! Rusty!
Rusty, come on, get back here.

1260
01:03:10,253 --> 01:03:12,199
Rusty, come back!
Rusty, Rusty!

1261
01:03:26,970 --> 01:03:28,972
What's she doing?

1262
01:03:29,005 --> 01:03:32,350
Now you have got to come with me.
It's important.

1263
01:03:32,375 --> 01:03:35,322
Why is she even here? There's no dogs
allowed in the tree house.

1264
01:03:35,345 --> 01:03:36,983
I think she wants us
to follow her.

1265
01:03:37,013 --> 01:03:39,425
I guess that's why she's barking.
Here, you go first.

1266
01:03:46,256 --> 01:03:48,668
Cheri!

1267
01:04:31,534 --> 01:04:35,004
Children: Cheri! Rusty!
Cheri, get over here!

1268
01:04:43,513 --> 01:04:45,515
So what are you
doing here?

1269
01:04:45,549 --> 01:04:47,893
Following Cheri.
What are you doing here?

1270
01:04:47,918 --> 01:04:49,829
I don't know.
Rusty brought us here.

1271
01:04:49,853 --> 01:04:53,164
Right, your dog just happened to bring
you here at the same time we're here?

1272
01:04:53,189 --> 01:04:55,135
- He did.
- Are you calling us liars?

1273
01:04:55,158 --> 01:04:57,035
Maybe. What are you
gonna do about it?

1274
01:04:57,060 --> 01:04:59,062
You're the ones moving
to New York anyway.

1275
01:04:59,095 --> 01:05:00,631
It's not like
you couldn't come.

1276
01:05:00,664 --> 01:05:02,837
Please, if she really cared,
she wouldn't go.

1277
01:05:02,866 --> 01:05:05,369
Then you shouldn't make it sound
like it's all her fault.

1278
01:05:05,402 --> 01:05:07,279
- ( Yelling )
- Quiet!

1279
01:05:07,304 --> 01:05:09,716
Stop arguing.

1280
01:05:11,374 --> 01:05:14,514
He's right.
It's not about whose fault it is.

1281
01:05:14,544 --> 01:05:16,956
It's about what we're gonna
do about it.

1282
01:05:16,980 --> 01:05:20,553
My mom loves your dad.
And your dad loves her.

1283
01:05:20,584 --> 01:05:22,621
So the question is

1284
01:05:22,652 --> 01:05:25,963
how are we gonna make sure
that they still get married?

1285
01:05:25,989 --> 01:05:29,198
I think we need some extra help
on this one.

1286
01:05:30,727 --> 01:05:31,899
Let's go.

1287
01:05:31,928 --> 01:05:33,930
( Rusty narrating )
Emma was right.

1288
01:05:33,964 --> 01:05:36,171
It was time to bring in
the big guns.

1289
01:05:36,199 --> 01:05:38,304
And there was only one person
in the whole town

1290
01:05:38,335 --> 01:05:40,337
who could possibly fix
the situation.

1291
01:05:58,288 --> 01:06:00,199
Okay, guys, it's safe.
Come on.

1292
01:06:02,392 --> 01:06:04,394
Okay, so what's the plan?

1293
01:06:04,427 --> 01:06:08,466
Emma: One of us has got to go over there
and tell him what we want for Christmas.

1294
01:06:08,498 --> 01:06:10,444
- The wedding.
- Exactly.

1295
01:06:10,467 --> 01:06:13,846
- So how do we pick who does it?
- Okay, we've got one shot at this.

1296
01:06:13,870 --> 01:06:15,941
Who's the one person
he can't possibly say no to?

1297
01:06:19,309 --> 01:06:21,812
- Me?
- Just trust us.

1298
01:06:21,845 --> 01:06:24,451
Well, hello, children.

1299
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:25,857
What are your names?

1300
01:06:31,021 --> 01:06:33,831
Look, I know you're not
the real Santa,

1301
01:06:33,857 --> 01:06:36,064
but that's okay.

1302
01:06:36,092 --> 01:06:38,629
Your secret's safe with me.

1303
01:06:38,661 --> 01:06:40,834
But I do know
that you're his helper,

1304
01:06:40,864 --> 01:06:42,741
so I was wondering

1305
01:06:42,766 --> 01:06:45,508
if you could ask him a favor.

1306
01:06:45,535 --> 01:06:48,675
Well, Santa's pretty busy
this time of year,

1307
01:06:48,705 --> 01:06:51,242
but I'm sure he can
do something.

1308
01:06:51,274 --> 01:06:52,480
What's your favor?

1309
01:06:52,509 --> 01:06:56,116
Well, my brothers and I

1310
01:06:56,146 --> 01:06:58,387
and the girls over there--

1311
01:06:58,414 --> 01:07:02,260
we'd like to get our parents
back together for Christmas.

1312
01:07:02,285 --> 01:07:05,164
They were supposed to get married
Christmas Day,

1313
01:07:05,188 --> 01:07:07,930
but now they're not.

1314
01:07:07,957 --> 01:07:09,493
Can you help them?

1315
01:07:09,525 --> 01:07:11,505
Hmm.

1316
01:07:11,528 --> 01:07:14,065
Well, that's a lovely
Christmas wish.

1317
01:07:14,097 --> 01:07:17,010
And don't you want something
for yourself,

1318
01:07:17,033 --> 01:07:19,536
say, a video game
or a bike?

1319
01:07:19,569 --> 01:07:23,483
No, this is all I want.
Can you help?

1320
01:07:23,506 --> 01:07:25,782
Well, it's a pretty tall order,

1321
01:07:25,808 --> 01:07:27,515
but I'll tell you what:

1322
01:07:27,544 --> 01:07:31,219
Elf Herbert, bring me
one of those flyers, please.

1323
01:07:31,247 --> 01:07:33,249
This is Elf Herbert.

1324
01:07:34,584 --> 01:07:37,690
( Grunts )
Thank you, Elf Herbert.

1325
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:41,031
You get them to come to this

1326
01:07:41,057 --> 01:07:43,059
and Santa's gonna see
what he can do, okay?

1327
01:07:43,092 --> 01:07:44,503
Okay.

1328
01:07:44,527 --> 01:07:46,529
Now you make sure
you get them there by noon.

1329
01:07:46,563 --> 01:07:47,598
Got it.

1330
01:07:47,630 --> 01:07:50,804
And you kids,
you all have a wonderful Christmas.

1331
01:07:50,834 --> 01:07:53,007
- Merry Christmas, Santa.
- Merry Christmas.

1332
01:07:53,036 --> 01:07:54,674
( laughs)

1333
01:07:54,704 --> 01:07:57,184
Now on your way.
Santa's got work to do.

1334
01:07:57,207 --> 01:07:59,983
( laughs )
Merry Christmas, children.

1335
01:08:00,009 --> 01:08:03,957
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.

1336
01:08:03,980 --> 01:08:06,824
Oops.
I'm coming, I'm coming.

1337
01:08:10,954 --> 01:08:12,421
Announcer: Ho ho ho!

Los Olives Christmas Fair!

1340
01:08:19,562 --> 01:08:21,473
Girls, what do you want to do?

1341
01:08:21,497 --> 01:08:23,807
I want to go to the stage, Dad.

1342
01:08:23,833 --> 01:08:26,541
You want to go to the stage?
You want to listen to music?

1343
01:08:26,569 --> 01:08:29,175
Madison: Yeah, come on.
Let's go over, come on.

1344
01:08:29,205 --> 01:08:30,946

- Emma: Come on.

1345
01:08:30,974 --> 01:08:32,885
Madison: Come on, we're gonna
miss the performance.

1346
01:08:32,909 --> 01:08:35,082
Jake: All right, all right,
we're going. We're going.

1347
01:08:35,111 --> 01:08:38,092
I mean, like, isn't this something?
They do it every year.

1348
01:08:38,114 --> 01:08:40,060
They've got music.
They've got games.

1349
01:08:40,083 --> 01:08:42,689
I even think they have a couple of
reindeer over there by the petting zoo.

I know things are
difficult right now.

01:08:51,127 --> 01:08:53,198
But promise me you'll try
to have a good time

1355
01:08:53,229 --> 01:08:55,971
-for the boys' sake.
- I promise. Okay okay.

1356
01:08:58,635 --> 01:09:01,172
- Hey, Jake, you made it.
- Hey.

1357
01:09:01,204 --> 01:09:04,344
- Can we go play?
- Yeah, I'm gonna look around.

1358
01:09:04,374 --> 01:09:07,184
- Okay, all right. Don't go far.
- Emma: Yeah, come on.

1359
01:09:07,210 --> 01:09:08,917
See you later.

1360
01:09:08,945 --> 01:09:10,947
Bye. What are you doing here?

1361
01:09:10,980 --> 01:09:13,483
You're looking at the main attraction.
We go on in five.

Stop it.
Are you playing here?

1363
01:09:14,851 --> 01:09:17,263
Just because we weren't good enough
to play at your wedding

1364
01:09:17,287 --> 01:09:19,494
doesn't mean that we're not
good enough to rock this house.

1365
01:09:19,522 --> 01:09:21,502
- How are you, gentlemen?
- Hey, Father.

1366
01:09:21,524 --> 01:09:23,094
- Reverend, how are you?
- Good to see you.

1367
01:09:23,126 --> 01:09:25,367
Frank, do you have a moment?
I just need to speak with you.

1368
01:09:25,395 --> 01:09:27,341

Well, it's about time.
Where have you been?

1451
01:14:08,444 --> 01:14:11,391
I've been holding MOCA off all day.
I re-read your contract though

1452
01:14:11,414 --> 01:14:13,724
and I gotta tell you,
you're getting a heck of a deal.

1453
01:14:13,750 --> 01:14:17,095
I would like you to tell them,
"Thank you very much for the offer,"

1454
01:14:17,120 --> 01:14:19,259
but I'm going to pass.

1455
01:14:19,288 --> 01:14:20,631
Susan, I'm sorry, hold on.

1456
01:14:22,091 --> 01:14:23,729
We must have
a bad connection,

1457
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:25,967
'cause it sounded like
you just said you were passing.

1458
01:14:25,995 --> 01:14:27,474
I did.

1459
01:14:27,497 --> 01:14:29,499
Okay, Susan,
I want you to listen to me.

1460
01:14:29,532 --> 01:14:32,103
I know how these small towns are.
They get inside of you

1461
01:14:32,135 --> 01:14:34,706
like one of those parasites--
when you go to a country, and they say

1462
01:14:34,737 --> 01:14:36,546
"Don't drink the water"
but you drink it anyway.

1463
01:14:36,572 --> 01:14:39,382
'Cause that's what's happening here,
Susan. I need you to be rational.

1464
01:14:39,409 --> 01:14:42,481
Everything you've ever worked for,
I'm getting you--

1465
01:14:42,512 --> 01:14:46,983
New York City, MOCA.
This is the big time, honey.

1466
01:14:47,016 --> 01:14:50,293
I know. You're right.
It is everything I've been working for,

1467
01:14:50,320 --> 01:14:53,529
but I've been working
for the wrong things.

1468
01:14:53,556 --> 01:14:55,968
I get it. it's the money.

1469
01:14:55,992 --> 01:14:58,529
You know, I had a feel--
okay, you just give me a number

1470
01:14:58,561 --> 01:15:00,563
and I'll go back to them
and I'll get you your money.

1471
01:15:00,597 --> 01:15:02,975
Family is the most
important thing.

1472
01:15:02,999 --> 01:15:05,343
An expense account?
A company car. A company car.

1473
01:15:05,368 --> 01:15:08,247
No, a longer lunch, of course,
so you can spend time with your family.

1474
01:15:08,271 --> 01:15:11,184
- No, not interested.
- You tell me what you're looking for.

1475
01:15:11,207 --> 01:15:13,414
I will go back to them.
I promise I'll get it.

1476
01:15:13,442 --> 01:15:17,151
Not unless they will move
the museum to Los Olives.

1477
01:15:17,180 --> 01:15:19,319
That could be difficult.

1478
01:15:19,349 --> 01:15:21,761
Thanks, Pat.

1479
01:15:21,784 --> 01:15:23,661
Bye.

1480
01:15:23,686 --> 01:15:26,098
I gotta check this Los Olives out.

1481
01:15:26,122 --> 01:15:28,363
Do not put your butt
on my couch!

1482
01:15:28,391 --> 01:15:30,632
( Rusty narrating )
Of course now there was the challenge

1483
01:15:30,660 --> 01:15:33,038
of putting everything back together
at a moment's notice.

1484
01:15:33,062 --> 01:15:36,565
And if there's one thing Jake
and Susan loved, it was a challenge.

1485
01:15:36,566 --> 01:15:39,479
The country club gave away the room
for a Christmas party.

1486
01:15:39,502 --> 01:15:41,607
Guys, guys, settle down
for a second here.

1487
01:15:41,637 --> 01:15:45,483
The caterer's booked.
The officiant went to Maui.

1488
01:15:45,508 --> 01:15:49,285
And our florist has been booked
by a charity event,

1489
01:15:49,312 --> 01:15:50,985
which is kind of irrelevant,

1490
01:15:51,013 --> 01:15:53,550
because it's too late for them to get
the flowers that we wanted anyway.

1491
01:15:53,582 --> 01:15:55,687
Okay, well, what about the cake?

1492
01:15:55,718 --> 01:15:59,063
She said something about
a restraining order and then hung up.

1493
01:16:00,590 --> 01:16:03,366
And the tuxedo guys is closed
until New Year's anyway.

1494
01:16:03,392 --> 01:16:06,168
We can just wait.
We don't have to do it on Christmas.

1495
01:16:06,195 --> 01:16:10,075
We can call
a justice of the peace.

1496
01:16:10,099 --> 01:16:14,241
Look, I promised my bride-to-be
a Christmas wedding.

1497
01:16:16,339 --> 01:16:20,185
And that is exactly
what you're going to get.

1498
01:16:20,209 --> 01:16:22,655
You're sweet.

1499
01:16:22,678 --> 01:16:24,624
I promise,

1500
01:16:24,647 --> 01:16:26,490
All right.

1501
01:16:26,515 --> 01:16:28,756
Hey hey hey, guys, guys.

1502
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:40,104
( Rusty narrating )
Finally the big day had arrived.

1503
01:16:40,129 --> 01:16:42,166
- Merry Christmas.
- Santa came.

1504
01:16:42,198 --> 01:16:44,678
Come on, wake up.
We've got to go open presents.

1505
01:16:44,700 --> 01:16:46,407
- Come on, come on, Mom.
- Come on, Mom.

1506
01:16:46,435 --> 01:16:48,437
- Rusty. Rusty.
- Susan: Where's Grandma?

1507
01:16:48,471 --> 01:16:51,111
- Come on, Rusty. Come on.
- Five more minutes.

1508
01:16:51,140 --> 01:16:53,484
- No, now. Come on.
- No, come on, now.

1509
01:16:53,509 --> 01:16:55,284
- All right.
- Rusty wants you to.

1510
01:16:55,311 --> 01:16:57,086
You are crazy, boys.

1511
01:16:57,113 --> 01:17:00,458
- Susan: Move it, move it, move it.
- Boys: Come on, go go go.

1512
01:17:04,620 --> 01:17:06,622
- Look, Santa came.
- Nice.

1513
01:17:06,656 --> 01:17:08,658
Oh my gosh.

1514
01:17:11,160 --> 01:17:13,538
Yay! Here we go.

1515
01:17:15,564 --> 01:17:18,636

Merry Christmas, girls.

1518
01:17:25,808 --> 01:17:27,446

Aw, look at that.

1523

Emma: it's the bear you always wanted,
but you never got it for Christmas.

( sighs )

1568
01:21:00,523 --> 01:21:02,935
Dearly beloved,

1569
01:21:02,958 --> 01:21:05,097
we are gathered here
in the presence

1570
01:21:05,127 --> 01:21:07,300
of these witnesses

1571
01:21:07,329 --> 01:21:11,778
to join Susan Davis and Jake Campbell
in holy matrimony.

1572
01:21:11,800 --> 01:21:13,780
( Rusty narrating )
I looked forward to this moment

1573
01:21:13,803 --> 01:21:16,682
since the day I first laid eyes on her.
I knew Cheri was the girl for me

1574
01:21:16,705 --> 01:21:19,083
and part of me actually wanted
to pinch myself

1575
01:21:19,108 --> 01:21:21,452
just to make sure
it was actually happening.

1576
01:21:21,477 --> 01:21:24,924
Of course without opposable thumbs
I couldn't really pinch myself,

1577
01:21:24,947 --> 01:21:27,484
but still it was
too good to be true.

1578
01:21:27,516 --> 01:21:29,894
But that's not all
that came over me that day.

1579
01:21:29,918 --> 01:21:32,899
It had been a long time
since I saw Susan smile like that.

1580
01:21:32,921 --> 01:21:35,299
I knew that just as much
as Cheri and I

1581
01:21:35,324 --> 01:21:37,930
were destined to be together,
so were they.

1582
01:21:37,960 --> 01:21:39,962
If I had tear ducts, I would cry.

1583
01:21:39,995 --> 01:21:42,373
Reverend:
May I have the rings?

1584
01:21:50,539 --> 01:21:52,712
Do you, Jake,

1585
01:21:52,742 --> 01:21:55,518
take Susan
to be your lawfully wedded wife,

1586
01:21:55,544 --> 01:21:57,490
to have and to hold,

1587
01:21:57,513 --> 01:21:59,720
in sickness and in health,

1588
01:21:59,749 --> 01:22:02,286

1589

I do.

1590
01:22:03,519 --> 01:22:05,965
And do you, Susan,

1591
01:22:05,988 --> 01:22:09,561
take Jake to be your
lawfully wedded husband,

1592
01:22:09,592 --> 01:22:14,371
to have and to hold,
in sickness and in health,

1593

1594
01:22:16,432 --> 01:22:18,275
I do.

By the powers vested in me,

1596
01:22:22,171 --> 01:22:24,777
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

1597
01:22:24,807 --> 01:22:28,084
Jake, you may now
kiss your bride.

Several guests, well,
acknowledging they'd never had

1622

fudge wedding cake before,

1623
01:24:13,649 --> 01:24:15,651
said it was the best
they'd ever had.

He even had a small
non-chocolate version

chocolate-intolerant.
