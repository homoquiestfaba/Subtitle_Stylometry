00:19:23,417 --> 00:19:26,250
<i>What if people see us?
I thought that wasn't okay.</i>

351
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,719
Fairy law, right?

352
00:19:28,088 --> 00:19:30,488
<i>It's dark and
we're not flying far.</i>

353
00:19:30,558 --> 00:19:31,547
No one will see us.

354
00:19:32,493 --> 00:19:34,154
You're sure
you can do this?

355
00:19:34,228 --> 00:19:35,752
<i>I'm a Shoe Fairy.</i>

356
00:19:35,829 --> 00:19:39,060
The more fabulous my shoes,
the stronger my magic.

357
00:19:39,133 --> 00:19:40,862
Check these babies.

358
00:19:41,635 --> 00:19:43,102
RAQUELLE: Ooh!

359
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:47,334
If I had to trust my life to one
pair of shoes, it would be those.

360
00:19:47,808 --> 00:19:51,471
They give me enough magic so we can
fly together when you hold my hand.

361
00:19:51,545 --> 00:19:55,572
And my purse comes with flying
power and a matching belt.

362
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:57,239
Ready?

363
00:20:02,923 --> 00:20:03,981
Oh.

364
00:20:07,061 --> 00:20:08,688
Oh, no, wait.

365

(GIRLS SCREAMING)

366
00:20:18,973 --> 00:20:20,634
(GASPS) Ah!

367
00:20:21,809 --> 00:20:22,935
Whew!

368
00:20:23,377 --> 00:20:26,403
We're flying.
We're really flying.

369
00:20:27,014 --> 00:20:29,915
Oh, and look.
How beautiful.

370
00:20:31,752 --> 00:20:34,619
This is definitely
the way to see Paris.

371
00:20:34,688 --> 00:20:36,019
Hold on.

372
00:20:36,657 --> 00:20:37,919
(GIRLS SCREAMING)

(KEN SCREAMING)

374
00:20:43,831 --> 00:20:46,698
Len, I heard
your horrible scream.

375
00:20:46,767 --> 00:20:49,258
Did Zane start the
duel early and hurt you?

376
00:20:49,436 --> 00:20:53,770
<i>No. Your attendants put me
in armor that's way too tight.</i>

377
00:20:54,675 --> 00:20:58,111
<i>I don't suppose you have
a can opener handy, do you?</i>

378
00:21:00,547 --> 00:21:02,481
(GROANS) Ow!

379
00:21:34,281 --> 00:21:36,772
TAYLOR: I know Lilliana
lives in this neighborhood.

380
00:21:40,354 --> 00:21:41,946
That must be it.

381
00:21:58,138 --> 00:21:59,537
Miss Roxelle?

382
00:22:05,412 --> 00:22:07,073
<i>Ah! Enchantée...</i>

383
00:22:07,581 --> 00:22:08,707
Barbie?

384
00:22:09,016 --> 00:22:10,813
Hi, Miss Roxelle.
Hi, Miss Roxelle.

385
00:22:11,251 --> 00:22:13,151
Ah. Fairies.

386
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:15,053
<i>Carrie and Taylor, oui?</i>

387
00:22:15,422 --> 00:22:16,411
<i>Oui.
Oui.</i>

388
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:17,752
Ahem.

389
00:22:18,859 --> 00:22:20,383
<i>I'm sorry,
do I know you?</i>

390
00:22:20,694 --> 00:22:22,252
Apparently not.

391
00:22:22,329 --> 00:22:24,593
Miss Roxelle,
we have a problem

392
00:22:24,665 --> 00:22:27,065
and Carrie and Taylor thought
you might be able to help.

393
00:22:27,601 --> 00:22:29,728
Perhaps I can. Come in.

394
00:22:36,477 --> 00:22:40,140
<i>LILLIANA: So, Princess Graciella flew
off with Ken and said she'd marry him?</i>

395
00:22:40,614 --> 00:22:43,549
And closed all the portals.
Except yours, of course.

396
00:22:43,817 --> 00:22:45,444
(SCOFFS) Of course.

397
00:22:45,519 --> 00:22:47,783
And of course,
I'll let you use it.

398
00:22:47,988 --> 00:22:50,718
But you might need
something more. Hmm.

399
00:22:51,525 --> 00:22:53,823
<i>Did you notice the
color of Graciella's eyes?</i>

400
00:22:54,395 --> 00:22:55,657
Yes. Violet.

401
00:22:55,729 --> 00:22:59,460
The perfect match to a sweet
pair of boots I bought last week.

402
00:22:59,533 --> 00:23:02,593
Violet? But Graciella has blue eyes.

403
00:23:03,203 --> 00:23:06,297
Ah-ha! Then she has
taken the love potion!

404
00:23:06,707 --> 00:23:07,696
(GASPS)

405
00:23:08,208 --> 00:23:09,539
A love potion?

406
00:23:14,281 --> 00:23:15,839
The potion
adds a little red,

407
00:23:15,916 --> 00:23:17,816
the color of love,
to the eyes.

408
00:23:17,885 --> 00:23:21,150
<i>The red turns blue eyes purple
and that's how you can tell.</i>

409
00:23:21,722 --> 00:23:26,182
Hmm. I used to dabble in
match-making, so I might still have...

410
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:31,192
<i>Oui. Not much left,
but enough for one dose.</i>

411
00:23:31,265 --> 00:23:35,258
Here. Release this mist
directly above Graciella

412
00:23:35,335 --> 00:23:36,996
so it can rain down on her.

413
00:23:37,471 --> 00:23:40,031
<i>That will break
the potion's spell.</i>

414
00:23:40,107 --> 00:23:41,335
Thank you.

415
00:23:41,675 --> 00:23:42,733
<i>Let's go.</i>

416
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:44,475
Whoa!

417
00:23:45,512 --> 00:23:48,777
Nice catch. I think you
two are good friends, yes?

418
00:23:48,849 --> 00:23:50,510
You seem to
work well together.

419
00:23:50,884 --> 00:23:52,112
BOTH: We do?

420
00:23:52,519 --> 00:23:53,918
<i>Oui. You do.</i>

421
00:23:56,723 --> 00:23:58,987
Now, come.
I'll take you to my portal.

422
00:24:01,895 --> 00:24:05,922
<i>"Rodeo Drive, Fifth Avenue, Shanghai"?</i>

423
00:24:05,999 --> 00:24:07,694
Are these all
Fairy Flyways?

424
00:24:08,202 --> 00:24:09,897
To my favorite
shopping spots.

425
00:24:09,970 --> 00:24:12,200
<i>For those times
when I just can't wait.</i>

426
00:24:13,006 --> 00:24:14,837
I so know
that feeling.

427
00:24:14,908 --> 00:24:16,671
You're not going
with them, are you?

428
00:24:16,743 --> 00:24:18,643
I thought you were
banned from Gloss Angeles.

429
00:24:19,179 --> 00:24:21,170
You know?
You are?

430
00:24:21,415 --> 00:24:22,439
We are.

431
00:24:22,516 --> 00:24:23,540
Why?

432
00:24:23,617 --> 00:24:25,778
<i>It's a long story.
But we're going back anyway.</i>

433
00:24:25,853 --> 00:24:28,321
But you face years in the
dungeons if you're caught.

434
00:24:28,789 --> 00:24:31,724
Friends stick together,
especially when things are rough.

435
00:24:31,792 --> 00:24:33,020
Exactly.

436
00:24:33,093 --> 00:24:34,424
Barbie has always
helped us,

437
00:24:34,495 --> 00:24:37,020
so we're going to
help her and Raquelle.

438
00:24:37,097 --> 00:24:38,997
Is it still okay
if we use your portal?

439
00:24:39,633 --> 00:24:41,123
But of course.

440
00:24:43,837 --> 00:24:44,861
Going up?

441
00:24:45,672 --> 00:24:47,833
Going up? But how?

442
00:24:47,908 --> 00:24:50,342
<i>We're in the penthouse,
there's no such thing as up.</i>

443
00:24:50,410 --> 00:24:52,878
<i>Like there's no
such thing as fairies?</i>

444
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:54,977
(SPEAKING FRENCH)

445
00:25:01,922 --> 00:25:03,184
Take care, Lilliana.

446
00:25:03,724 --> 00:25:05,089
Nice shoes.

447
00:25:05,459 --> 00:25:06,756
See you soon.

448
00:25:06,827 --> 00:25:08,761
We really appreciate it.

449
00:25:08,829 --> 00:25:10,660
Bye, Lilliana. Thank you.

450
00:25:11,198 --> 00:25:13,393
<i>Bonne chance. Be careful.</i>

451
00:25:28,348 --> 00:25:31,840
Barbie, Raquelle,
welcome to Gloss Angeles.

452
00:25:36,056 --> 00:25:37,648
<i>It's incredible.</i>

453
00:25:38,458 --> 00:25:40,187
<i>I can't believe
it's real.</i>

454
00:25:41,194 --> 00:25:43,287
<i>I can't believe
it's so high in the air.</i>

455
00:25:44,231 --> 00:25:46,096
How far down
is the ground?

456
00:25:46,366 --> 00:25:47,526
Ground?

457
00:25:47,834 --> 00:25:49,893
Yeah, the ground.
I mean, if I fell,

458
00:25:49,970 --> 00:25:51,733
<i>I wouldn't just keep
falling forever, right?</i>

459
00:25:51,805 --> 00:25:53,238
<i>Sooner or later
I'd hit the...</i>

460
00:25:59,646 --> 00:26:01,511
<i>Oh. There's no ground.</i>

461
00:26:02,149 --> 00:26:03,138
<i>That's okay.</i>

462
00:26:03,216 --> 00:26:05,741
We'll just hold onto Carrie
and Taylor, like before.

463
00:26:05,819 --> 00:26:08,310
On a rescue mission?
Too risky.

464

<i>If there's trouble, you
might have to fly on your own.</i>

465
00:26:10,757 --> 00:26:13,920
Yeah, see, no problem.
We'll just fly on our own.

466
00:26:14,328 --> 00:26:15,886
<i>We can't fly on our own.</i>

467
00:26:16,163 --> 00:26:17,221
Yet.

468
00:26:17,297 --> 00:26:20,266

go to Wings and Things.

476
00:26:54,601 --> 00:26:57,195
Wait until you experience

<i>And didn't think twice
about staying here forever.</i>

<i>Forever? You really can't go
back once you've married a fairy?</i>

Never?
Nope, never.

to get past the palace fairies.

with Princess Graciella,

735
00:43:12,345 --> 00:43:14,779
then out of nowhere, she
proclaimed we betrayed her

736
00:43:14,847 --> 00:43:16,144
and she banned us.

737
00:43:16,215 --> 00:43:17,307
Which is fine.

What?
Why would I do that?

891

Because you're
the queen of the school.

you're talented.

<i>I totally wanted to be your
friend, but you weren't interested.</i>

895
00:52:43,448 --> 00:52:44,642
You never
said a word to me.

896

And you certainly never invited
me to eat lunch with you.

eat lunch with me?

you glared and turned away.

900
00:52:55,327 --> 00:52:58,694
<i>I didn't even know you. You
wouldn't say two words to me.</i>

901
00:52:58,931 --> 00:53:00,592
Because I was shy.

902
00:53:01,967 --> 00:53:05,232

a little insecure.

Maybe I am a little
insecure sometimes.

tried harder to be your friend.

I really wanted to.

910
00:53:25,857 --> 00:53:28,917

I was dying to get to know you.

We were in acting class and you
seemed so confident and talented.

I thought it would be
great to be your friend.

914

But then you
were so distant.

915
00:53:39,037 --> 00:53:40,595
And then mean.

916
00:53:40,973 --> 00:53:42,372
<i>I figured
you just didn't like me.</i>

917
00:53:42,741 --> 00:53:45,039
I definitely
should have tried harder.

we can be friends?

01:04:24,315 --> 01:04:28,615
And almost as cool as our
wings. Impressive, right?

1051
01:04:29,454 --> 01:04:32,582
<i>Okay, now I'm getting a real complex.</i>

1052
01:04:32,891 --> 01:04:34,449
(ALL LAUGHING)

1053
01:04:36,160 --> 01:04:40,893
Wait. How are we going to go
home when we have real live wings?

1054
01:04:41,299 --> 01:04:43,130
<i>I don't know. Can we?</i>

1055
01:04:43,201 --> 01:04:44,634
Of course you can.

1056
01:04:44,702 --> 01:04:46,897
Your wings will
disappear when you leave,

1057
01:04:47,205 --> 01:04:50,766
and magically reappear whenever
you come back to Gloss Angeles.

1058
01:04:51,409 --> 01:04:53,934
Perfect. We'll come back
all the time.

1059
01:04:54,012 --> 01:04:55,843
Wait until we tell
people about this place.

1060
01:04:55,914 --> 01:04:58,508
They'll be swarming
through the doors.

1061
01:04:58,583 --> 01:05:02,542
Uh, wait. Can you keep the Fairy Secret?

1062
01:05:03,121 --> 01:05:06,852
<i>The Fairy Secret is huge. We
can't keep it to ourselves.</i>

1063
01:05:06,925 --> 01:05:08,324
The paparazzi
will go nuts for it.

1064
01:05:08,393 --> 01:05:10,793
It'll mean huge publicity
for me and Barbie.

1065
01:05:10,862 --> 01:05:12,955
It'll be great for our
careers. Am I right?

1066
01:05:13,031 --> 01:05:14,623
<i>I don't know, Raquelle.</i>

1067
01:05:16,067 --> 01:05:18,194
<i>Let's not worry
about it right now.</i>

1068
01:05:18,269 --> 01:05:20,999
After all, you might
wake up in the morning

1069
01:05:21,072 --> 01:05:23,063
and think
this was all a dream.

1070
01:05:23,441 --> 01:05:25,909
<i>A dream?
There's no way.</i>

1071
01:05:26,344 --> 01:05:29,677
This has been the most
incredible experience of my life.

1072
01:05:30,048 --> 01:05:31,447
Mine, too.

1073
01:05:31,516 --> 01:05:34,349
A magic land, fairies
living in the human world.

1074
01:05:34,719 --> 01:05:36,118
Horses with wings.

1075
01:05:36,521 --> 01:05:39,012
Nearly getting
obliterated in a duel.

1076
01:05:39,991 --> 01:05:42,892
<i>I don't know. Maybe some things
wouldn't be so bad to forget.</i>

1077
01:05:43,461 --> 01:05:45,486
(ALL LAUGHING)

1078
01:05:53,972 --> 01:05:56,236
<i>It's been a great day,
Graciella,</i>

1079
01:05:56,307 --> 01:05:58,002
but we should
be getting back.

1080
01:05:58,710 --> 01:06:00,575
Thank you all
for everything.

1081
01:06:20,865 --> 01:06:22,799
(YAWNING)

1082
01:06:34,379 --> 01:06:35,368
Ken?

1083
01:06:36,047 --> 01:06:39,483
<i>Yeah, everything's okay. I feel
like I just had the weirdest dream.</i>

1084
01:06:41,152 --> 01:06:42,551
You did, too?

1085
01:06:42,820 --> 01:06:44,879
Yeah, Wally's. Half hour.

1086
01:06:48,259 --> 01:06:50,193
<i>I can't remember
any of the details.</i>

1087
01:06:50,261 --> 01:06:53,424
<i>It's like, it's almost
there, but I can't grab it.</i>

1088
01:06:53,498 --> 01:06:54,624
My dream, too.

1089
01:06:55,233 --> 01:06:58,930
But I know for sure your stylists
were in it. Carrie and Taylor, right?

1090
01:06:59,370 --> 01:07:03,898
<i>Yeah, Carrie and Taylor. They
were in mine, too. Oh, it's weird.</i>

1091
01:07:04,008 --> 01:07:07,171
But the really weird thing is I
have this incredibly strong feeling

1092
01:07:07,245 --> 01:07:08,269
that in the dream,

1093
01:07:08,346 --> 01:07:11,110
Raquelle and I,
we were friends.

1094
01:07:11,549 --> 01:07:12,846
Friends?

1095
01:07:13,117 --> 01:07:16,143
<i>I know. Like she'd ever let that happen.</i>

1096
01:07:16,687 --> 01:07:19,520
Hey. Mind if I join you?

1097
01:07:19,590 --> 01:07:21,251
I had a feeling you
were going to be here.

1098
01:07:22,293 --> 01:07:23,851
Sure, go ahead.

1099
01:07:26,030 --> 01:07:27,327
Really?

1100
01:07:27,598 --> 01:07:29,759
You're not going to sit
with Ken and flirt with him?

1101
01:07:30,034 --> 01:07:33,128
<i>Why would I do that?
He's your boyfriend.</i>

1102
01:07:34,539 --> 01:07:37,633
Oh! Super-cute outfit.
Where did you get it?

1103
01:07:38,342 --> 01:07:39,468
What?

1104
01:07:40,478 --> 01:07:44,107
<i>Nothing, it's just... You're
being really nice to me.</i>

1105
01:07:44,182 --> 01:07:45,342
Believe me, I like it.

1106
01:07:45,416 --> 01:07:47,213
<i>It's just different.</i>

1107
01:07:47,885 --> 01:07:49,375
<i>I know, it's weird.</i>

1108
01:07:49,454 --> 01:07:52,685
<i>I don't really get it, either,
but I had this dream last night,</i>

1109
01:07:52,757 --> 01:07:54,384
<i>and I can't remember
the details,</i>

1110
01:07:54,459 --> 01:07:57,656
but I woke up feeling like
we're friends. Good friends.

1111
01:07:57,995 --> 01:08:00,156
I had a dream
like that, too.

1112
01:08:00,364 --> 01:08:02,127
Weird.
Very weird.

1113
01:08:02,667 --> 01:08:03,691
TAYLOR: Hey.

1114
01:08:03,768 --> 01:08:06,202
We thought we might catch
the two of you here together.

1115
01:08:06,270 --> 01:08:07,669
You did?

1116
01:08:07,738 --> 01:08:10,263
We wanted to stop in
and say goodbye.

1117
01:08:10,708 --> 01:08:12,335
Goodbye?
Where are you going?

1118
01:08:12,643 --> 01:08:14,702
We reconnected
with an old friend,

1119
01:08:14,779 --> 01:08:17,213
so we're going to spend
some time in our hometown.

1120
01:08:17,281 --> 01:08:19,306
It was great hanging out
with you both, though.

1121
01:08:19,383 --> 01:08:20,941
We know we'll see you again.

1122
01:08:21,486 --> 01:08:25,149
Hanging out with you?
But I barely even know you.

1123
01:08:26,023 --> 01:08:27,251
Uh...

1124
01:08:27,525 --> 01:08:29,925
Look at the time.
Gotta fly. Bye.

1125
01:08:30,027 --> 01:08:31,187
Bye.

1126
01:08:33,798 --> 01:08:37,256
Wow. Looks like your
stylists skipped town.

1127
01:08:37,535 --> 01:08:41,801
<i>Guess we know one star who won't shine
as brightly on the next red carpet.</i>

1128
01:08:44,041 --> 01:08:45,133
Oopsie.

1129
01:08:45,409 --> 01:08:48,242
Guess old habits
die hard, girlfriend.

1130
01:08:49,413 --> 01:08:50,971
(ALL LAUGHING)

1131
01:09:00,358 --> 01:09:01,757
(BOTH SHUSHING)

1132
01:09:25,016 --> 01:09:28,008
<i>Sometimes I blend in
like a book on a shelf</i>

1133
01:09:28,920 --> 01:09:32,185
<i>Sometimes I wear my jeans
like anyone else</i>

1134
01:09:32,256 --> 01:09:35,714
<i>There's millions of chameleons
blending in all around</i>

1135
01:09:36,627 --> 01:09:39,425
<i>Sometimes I wanna be found</i>

1136
01:09:40,031 --> 01:09:42,898
<i>'Cause there is
so much more to me</i>

1137
01:09:43,935 --> 01:09:46,927
<i>More than I could ever show</i>

1138
01:09:48,005 --> 01:09:51,133
<i>If you wanna fly with me</i>

1139
01:09:51,809 --> 01:09:55,677
<i>There is one thing
I got to know</i>

1140
01:09:55,746 --> 01:09:59,807
<i>Can you keep
a secret, secret?</i>

1141
01:10:03,387 --> 01:10:07,084
<i>Can you keep
a secret, secret?</i>

1142
01:10:11,362 --> 01:10:12,420
<i>A secret</i>

1143
01:10:12,496 --> 01:10:15,329
<i>Sometimes what you see
is not what you get</i>

1144
01:10:16,267 --> 01:10:19,395
<i>Sometimes you haven't
seen anything yet</i>

1145
01:10:19,470 --> 01:10:23,338
<i>I'm not the same melody
that everyone sings</i>

1146
01:10:23,841 --> 01:10:26,901
<i>Can't you tell
I'm hiding my wings?</i>

1147
01:10:27,445 --> 01:10:30,346
<i>'Cause there is
so much more to me</i>

1148
01:10:31,415 --> 01:10:34,384
<i>More than I could ever show</i>

1149
01:10:35,419 --> 01:10:38,286
<i>If you wanna fly with me</i>

1150
01:10:39,257 --> 01:10:42,954
<i>There is one thing
I got to know</i>

1151
01:10:44,095 --> 01:10:47,656
<i>Can you keep
a secret, secret?</i>

1152
01:10:51,902 --> 01:10:55,394
<i>Can you keep
a secret, secret?</i>

1153
01:11:01,412 --> 01:11:02,401
<i>A secret</i>

1154
01:11:02,480 --> 01:11:07,713
<i>Come with me and you'll see
a world beyond your dreams</i>

1155
01:11:07,785 --> 01:11:10,219
<i>More than it seems</i>

1156
01:11:10,288 --> 01:11:16,989
<i>Come with me and you'll see
that you can fly like me</i>

1157
01:11:17,061 --> 01:11:20,656
<i>Can you keep
a secret, secret?</i>

1158
01:11:25,002 --> 01:11:28,301
<i>Can you keep
a secret, secret?</i>

1159
01:11:32,243 --> 01:11:35,906
<i>Can you keep
a secret, secret?</i>

1160
01:11:40,184 --> 01:11:43,711
<i>Can you keep
a secret, secret?</i>

1161
01:11:50,161 --> 01:11:51,492
<i>A secret</i>
