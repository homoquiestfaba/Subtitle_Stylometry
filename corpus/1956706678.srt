00:00:01,675 --> 00:00:04,508
(Multicom Jingle)

2
00:00:25,496 --> 00:00:28,246
(tinkling music)

3
00:01:12,066 --> 00:01:14,816
(waves crashing)

4
00:01:25,129 --> 00:01:28,046
(light jazz music)

5
00:02:31,207 --> 00:02:32,916
- [Marilyn] When I was
born in the charity ward

6
00:02:32,916 --> 00:02:37,521
of the Los Angeles County
Hospital, my mother wasn't there.

7
00:02:37,521 --> 00:02:40,271
Where my mother was, no one knew.

8
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:44,392
- Mrs. Mortenson, are you in here?

9
00:02:44,392 --> 00:02:46,809
(baby cries)

10
00:02:48,732 --> 00:02:49,565
Shh.

11
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:55,070
Mrs. Mortenson?

12
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:00,740
Mrs. Mortenson, is that you back there?

13
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:04,540
We've been searching
all over the hospital.

14
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,200
Aren't you even gonna have a look

15
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,700
at your beautiful little girl?

16
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:16,010
Please, Mrs. Mortenson,
you can't stay in here.

17
00:03:17,116 --> 00:03:19,900
(baby crying)

18
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,490
This is one sweet baby.

19
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,140
- Am I really the mother?

20
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:25,690
- Of course you're the mother.

21
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:27,040
I helped with the delivery.

22
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:29,760
Come on now.

23
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:34,014
- But what if I drop it?

24
00:03:34,014 --> 00:03:36,480
(baby crying)

25
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,040
Oh, it's so hot,

26
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,410
and heavy.

27
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:42,190
- She's a normal, healthy baby.

28
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:44,573
A beauty.

29
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:46,540
Look at those eyes.

30
00:03:48,619 --> 00:03:52,330
- Hell, kid wasn't half
bad-looking, I decided to keep her.

31
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:55,920
I named her Norma, after Norma Talmadge,

32
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,240
and Jeane after Jean Harlow.

33
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,250
Norma Jeane Baker.

34
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,590
Baker's not her father, but he's

35
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:06,900
the husband I hated the least.

36
00:04:07,874 --> 00:04:09,660
(laughs)

37
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:10,493
- Oh!

38
00:04:11,881 --> 00:04:13,700
Oh my goodness.

39
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:14,750
Oh!

40
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:17,350
Oh, honey, now listen.

41
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:21,390
Do you remember what I
told you, Norma Jeane,

42
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:23,580
when you're with your mother, watch out

43
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:25,696
for those changes of moods?

44
00:04:25,696 --> 00:04:27,340
- I do, Grandma.

45
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:29,230
I always do what you say.

46
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:30,880
- Well if you think that
it's getting dangerous,

47
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,900
I want you to run to a
telephone and call me.

48
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:36,550
I will go and I will get a taxi cab

49
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:39,560
and I don't even care if it's $5,

50
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,880
I'm gonna come and get you.

51
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,876
Will you remember?

52
00:04:42,876 --> 00:04:44,880
- I'll remember.

53
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,050
- Oh, look, look, look.

54
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:47,000
See that tough guy?

55
00:04:47,912 --> 00:04:50,120
A regular Jimmy Cagney.

56
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:53,750
Now that is a movie star I really like.

57
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:56,280
A real man.

58
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,310
He knows when his number's up.

59
00:04:59,303 --> 00:05:00,970
- What about that one?

60
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:02,050
- That one.

61
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:03,470
That one is Mary Pickford.

62
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:05,930
America's sweetheart.

63
00:05:07,343 --> 00:05:12,343
- Oh Grandma, where do
they go when they fly away?

64
00:05:14,091 --> 00:05:16,868
- I don't know.

65
00:05:16,868 --> 00:05:18,537
China!

66
00:05:18,537 --> 00:05:21,420
- Let's go to China, fly with me!

67
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:22,253
Come on!

68
00:05:24,516 --> 00:05:27,870
- My crazy daughter was
unfit to be a mother.

69
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:31,140
I took Norma Jeane when
she was just a baby.

70
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:36,750
I wanted to adopt her, give
her my last name, Monroe.

71
00:05:38,092 --> 00:05:41,110
But Gladys wouldn't let me.

72
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:41,943
Oh no.

73
00:05:41,943 --> 00:05:42,930
- Norma Jeane, come.

74
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:46,130
- [Della] She preferred to board her out.

75
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:49,050
- Norma Jeane, my love,
come come come, come.

76
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:52,870
- [Della] Paid me $5 a week plus expenses.

77
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:53,920
- Your birthday.

78
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:57,330
I will not be deprived of
mother love on this special day.

79
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:00,320
Oh.

80
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,640
- Wait.

81
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,473
Wait.

82
00:06:04,182 --> 00:06:06,610
Tell me something, what
have you been smoking?

83
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:09,180
Look at me, girl.

84
00:06:11,783 --> 00:06:12,683
Are you hopped up?

85
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:16,200
- I've never even smelled
marijuana, let alone smoked it.

86
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,040
And that goes double for opium.

87
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,633
Never.

88
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:23,083
- [Della] Wait!

89
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:25,940
- Rain or shine, sickness or in health,

90
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:29,230
till death do us part, I vow.

91
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:31,890
There you go, baby.

92
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:34,600
- When will you be getting
my granddaughter back?

93
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,810
- Ignore your grandmother, dear,

94
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:39,580
she's silent film and we are talkies.

95
00:06:42,048 --> 00:06:44,196
(upbeat jazz music)

96
00:06:44,196 --> 00:06:46,613
(horn honks)

97
00:06:54,324 --> 00:06:56,741
(horn honks)

98
00:07:01,163 --> 00:07:04,330
(children chattering)

99
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,300
My new neighborhood.

100
00:07:08,316 --> 00:07:10,166
And only six minutes from the studio.

101
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,400
I have a surprise for you, birthday girl.

102
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,233
Let's go.

103
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:18,510
There's someone waiting and
he might be getting impatient.

104
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:22,963
Voila!

105
00:07:25,313 --> 00:07:27,480
(panting)

106
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,304
(sighs)

107
00:07:36,304 --> 00:07:39,950
Well let's see, where could
our special someone be?

108
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:42,920
Very cold, you're cold,
you're cold, you're cold.

109
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:46,563
Getting warmer.

110
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:49,670
Oh, come on, come on, in here.

111
00:07:51,751 --> 00:07:52,990
Hmm?

112
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:57,930
Oh, Norma Jeane.

113
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:00,770
I swear, sometimes I think you're blind.

114
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:02,660
Open your eyes.

115
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:04,923
Don't you see?

116
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:07,093
No?

117
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:10,390
This man is your father.

118
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:13,420
- My father?

119
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:14,533
- Yes.

120
00:08:14,533 --> 00:08:15,620
What'd you think, you didn't have one?

121
00:08:16,956 --> 00:08:19,130
Oh, it's a beautiful
name, an important name,

122
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:23,130
but a name I can't utter, even
Grandma Della doesn't know.

123
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:26,110
- Where is he?

124
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:27,450
- Away.

125
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:29,164
At a great distance.

126
00:08:29,164 --> 00:08:32,850
He's risked his life in
the name of democracy.

127
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:39,080
But someday, he will return
to Los Angeles to claim you.

128
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:46,650
Happy birthday, Norma Jeane.

129
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:49,580
Didn't I tell you this
would be your special day?

130
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:52,270
Oh yes, yes, I have a dress for you.

131
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:53,390
Beautiful, satin.

132
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,900
You'll look like a princess.

133
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,124
Too short?

134
00:08:59,124 --> 00:09:04,085
Well, go on, try it on.

135
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:07,190
Hophead bastard of a baker.

136
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:08,550
Spelled birthday wrong.

137
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:10,453
And your name.

138
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:12,243
I told him.

139
00:09:13,486 --> 00:09:16,470
(upbeat jazz music)

140
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:17,303
Norma Jeane.

141
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,400
You must make a wish.

142
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:24,800
A wish to make you know
who return to us soon.

143
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:27,393
Go on, go on.

144
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,167
(blowing)

145
00:09:32,764 --> 00:09:34,804
(laughing)

146
00:09:34,804 --> 00:09:36,404
There you are, good as a prayer.

147
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:45,051
Well, don't be scared.

148
00:09:45,051 --> 00:09:50,051
Only gonna cut the cake.

149
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:54,430
(water running)

150
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:55,263
Shame on you.

151
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:57,560
Oh, shame, the cake!

152
00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:00,620
Cake all over you.

153
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:02,533
Oh.

154
00:10:04,355 --> 00:10:05,800
Do you do these things deliberately?

155
00:10:07,024 --> 00:10:08,274
- No, I didn't.

156
00:10:09,464 --> 00:10:11,090
- Well who did, Santa Claus?

157
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:12,840
Don't you know that I borrowed this dress

158
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,820
from the studio and now it's ruined?

159
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:16,640
Where do you think clothes come from?

160
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,340
You think they just grow on trees?

161
00:10:19,428 --> 00:10:20,261
Sit, sit!

162
00:10:21,424 --> 00:10:23,508
- It's kind of hot.

163
00:10:23,508 --> 00:10:24,704
Mother!

164
00:10:24,704 --> 00:10:26,920
- No, sit still.

165
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:27,935
Where is the soap?

166
00:10:27,935 --> 00:10:29,328
Soap.

167
00:10:29,328 --> 00:10:32,350
So much dirt, outside of us and in.

168
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:39,215
Hope is the thing with feathers
that perches in the soul

169
00:10:39,215 --> 00:10:42,510
and sings the tune without the words,

170
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:44,220
and never stops at all.

171
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:50,590
Emily Dickinson, that's
so lovely, isn't it?

172
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:54,080
Hope is the thing with feathers
that perches in the soul.

173
00:10:56,975 --> 00:11:01,975
I always wanted to be a
poet, like Emily Dickinson or

174
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,900
Edna St. Vincent Millay.

175
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,370
I have the soul of a poet.

176
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:14,200
Of course, I was an
actress once, you know.

177
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:17,020
I just trasnferred to another department.

178
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:23,300
Maybe you'll be my poet.

179
00:11:28,624 --> 00:11:30,590
What's wrong with me?

180
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:32,390
I can't believe it, I almost forgot.

181
00:11:33,935 --> 00:11:36,990
I have another present
for the birthday girl.

182
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:39,270
Come on.

183
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:41,573
Ta da.

184
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:48,620
Norma Jeane, do you remember who

185
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:50,640
used to sleep in this drawer?

186
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:53,480
In this very drawer, you
remember who slept here?

187
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,640
You.

188
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:55,980
You, Norma Jeane.

189
00:11:57,348 --> 00:11:59,810
I was so poor I couldn't afford a crib.

190
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,540
This drawer was your crib.

191
00:12:06,964 --> 00:12:10,047
(somber piano music)

192
00:12:35,915 --> 00:12:36,998
Sweet dreams.

193
00:12:55,289 --> 00:12:56,122
- Daddy.

194
00:12:58,409 --> 00:12:59,765
Daddy.

195
00:12:59,765 --> 00:13:03,170
It would be said of me that
I was unhappy as a child,

196
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:07,485
that my childhood was a desperate one,

197
00:13:07,485 --> 00:13:10,080
but let me tell you, I was never unhappy.

198
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:14,100
So long as I had my mother,
I was never unhappy.

199
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:21,920
And my father, well,
I had a picture of him

200
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:28,485
forever etched in my mind.

201
00:13:28,485 --> 00:13:30,735
(laughing)

202
00:13:32,491 --> 00:13:33,658
- Norma Jeane?

203
00:13:35,865 --> 00:13:36,865
Norma Jeane!

204
00:13:38,505 --> 00:13:40,245
- Here she comes.

205
00:13:40,245 --> 00:13:41,078
That old fat elephant.

206
00:13:42,557 --> 00:13:43,390
Let's run.

207
00:13:48,896 --> 00:13:50,599
She don't see us.

208
00:13:50,599 --> 00:13:54,500
- Norma Jeane!

209
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,617
Norma Jeane.

210
00:13:57,617 --> 00:14:00,200
(wind blowing)

211
00:14:02,157 --> 00:14:04,907
(birds chirping)

212
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:16,060
- Grandma, I'm home!

213
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:19,623
Grandma?

214
00:14:24,504 --> 00:14:25,337
(gasps) Grandma!

215
00:14:27,412 --> 00:14:29,662
(coughing)

216
00:14:32,713 --> 00:14:35,796
(Norma Jeane crying)

217
00:14:42,189 --> 00:14:43,939
- I love you so much.

218
00:14:47,029 --> 00:14:49,240
- It was my fault she died.

219
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,840
I wouldn't come when she called.

220
00:14:51,804 --> 00:14:52,637
I was bad.

221
00:14:54,829 --> 00:14:57,320
- Look, it was God's fault.

222
00:15:01,327 --> 00:15:02,160
Now, go to bed.

223
00:15:04,644 --> 00:15:06,230
I have to get up early in the morning.

224
00:15:08,424 --> 00:15:09,580
(sighs)

225
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:10,413
- Mother.

226
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:12,620
Can she hear us?

227
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,680
Can Grandma hear us?

228
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:16,423
- I hope not.

229
00:15:17,799 --> 00:15:19,340
- It was my fault.

230
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:20,720
Oh Mommy.

231
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,170
- Don't call me Mommy.

232
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:24,920
I just, I hate those pukey cute titles.

233
00:15:26,809 --> 00:15:28,892
(crying)

234
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:31,613
Look.

235
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:36,490
Your grandma's number came up is all.

236
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:39,690
You don't go until your number's up.

237
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:42,390
That's why I'm a fatalist.

238
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:44,490
Can't argue with logic.

239
00:15:47,977 --> 00:15:50,227
(coughing)

240
00:15:54,488 --> 00:15:55,405
This cough.

241
00:15:56,388 --> 00:15:57,471
My hands too.

242
00:15:58,913 --> 00:16:01,263
The chemicals in the film
lab are stronger now.

243
00:16:03,592 --> 00:16:05,380
My eyes, my lungs.

244
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:09,080
My job is killing me.

245
00:16:15,592 --> 00:16:17,920
You know what you have to
do after school tomorrow?

246
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,700
- Walk to the movie?

247
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:21,250
- Sit at the back on the aisle.

248
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:23,990
Don't sit too close to men.

249
00:16:25,692 --> 00:16:28,610
- But see, they keep sitting by me.

250
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:30,730
- You're not listening.

251
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:36,830
On the way home, walk on the
curb under the street light.

252
00:16:37,912 --> 00:16:39,920
That way you'll be seen if
anybody tries to grab you.

253
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,928
(coughing)

254
00:16:43,928 --> 00:16:45,920
Don't tell anybody about
these movie days, all right?

255
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:48,370
I have to work late.

256
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:52,830
There are tasks in developing
that only I can do.

257
00:16:54,428 --> 00:16:55,261
I mustn't fail.

258
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:58,760
They would fire me, and
that would be the end.

259
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:05,000
I'm not a bad mother.

260
00:17:06,330 --> 00:17:09,820
I coulda put you in an
orphanage and I didn't, did I?

261
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:10,910
- Mommy!

262
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:11,743
- Oh, damn.

263
00:17:16,584 --> 00:17:17,452
(sighs)

264
00:17:17,452 --> 00:17:18,285
What next?

265
00:17:20,108 --> 00:17:22,957
(somber music)

266
00:17:22,957 --> 00:17:24,308
- [Woman] Hello darling.

267
00:17:24,308 --> 00:17:25,247
- [Man] Vera.

268
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:27,350
How did you happen to come?

269
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:28,580
- [Woman] Just passin' by.

270
00:17:29,932 --> 00:17:32,307
I wanted to rub my nose against your door.

271
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:37,010
- And then the fairy princess died,

272
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:38,980
she had golden hair and it was spread out

273
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:40,730
all over her pillow.

274
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:42,014
- That was the end?

275
00:17:42,014 --> 00:17:42,870
Huh.

276
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:44,760
The dark prince was long
gone by then, I suppose.

277
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,060
Careful, careful, careful.

278
00:17:47,313 --> 00:17:49,790
- No, no, the dark prince loved her.

279
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:52,120
He was standing over her, crying.

280
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:54,510
I don't want her to die.

281
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:55,490
- That's because you understand

282
00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:57,470
how important it is to stay alive.

283
00:17:57,470 --> 00:17:58,883
- Easy.

284
00:17:58,883 --> 00:18:00,050
(grunts)

285
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:01,010
- Be careful, boys.

286
00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:02,420
Fredrick March gave me this piano

287
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:04,270
and I don't want it to get scratched.

288
00:18:05,337 --> 00:18:06,514
(man chuckles)

289
00:18:06,514 --> 00:18:09,230
Your father would be
so jealous if he knew.

290
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,140
I have plans for you.

291
00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:14,790
For us.

292
00:18:15,728 --> 00:18:19,330
(upbeat jazz music)

293
00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:20,470
Ah, there, you see?

294
00:18:21,318 --> 00:18:26,020
The home of Barbara Lamar,
the girl who's too beautiful.

295
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:28,600
That's just a joke, sweetie.

296
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:31,776
Can't be too beautiful, just
like you can't be too rich.

297
00:18:31,776 --> 00:18:33,270
(chuckles)

298
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:35,550
Don't squint, darling.

299
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:38,778
You'll make yourself wear
glasses and that'll be the end.

300
00:18:38,778 --> 00:18:40,290
- Look, there's a castle!

301
00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:42,880
- That's where Jean Harlow used to live.

302
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,970
Jean, our Jean.

303
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:47,010
The one you were named after.

304
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:49,460
Look, look, look, over there.

305
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:50,293
Merna Loy.

306
00:18:51,912 --> 00:18:54,260
(sighs)

307
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:55,760
Ah,

308
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,530
this is the most famous of all.

309
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:04,750
Falcon's Lair, home of the
late Rudolph Valentino.

310
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:07,500
The man had no talent for acting at all.

311
00:19:08,451 --> 00:19:09,401
No talent for life.

312
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:14,810
But he was photogenic and
he died at the right time.

313
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:19,390
Remember, Norma Jeane,
die at the right time.

314
00:19:28,852 --> 00:19:33,852
(simple piano music)
(humming)

315
00:19:40,493 --> 00:19:41,743
- That tickles.

316
00:19:43,572 --> 00:19:48,572
- Now don't be silly, you come
back here, finish the piece.

317
00:19:49,249 --> 00:19:51,833
Now.

318
00:19:51,833 --> 00:19:56,833
(humming)
(simple piano music)

319
00:19:57,181 --> 00:19:58,249
(laughing)

320
00:19:58,249 --> 00:20:01,249
- [Gladys] What's going on in there?

321
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:08,929
- No more lessons today.

322
00:20:08,929 --> 00:20:13,318
(light jazz music)
(laughing)

323
00:20:13,318 --> 00:20:14,318
- Tickle me.

324
00:20:15,699 --> 00:20:17,073
- No.

325
00:20:17,073 --> 00:20:17,941
No.

326
00:20:17,941 --> 00:20:18,937
- Tickle me with your tongue.

327
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,510
- Norma Jeane, behave yourself.

328
00:20:23,218 --> 00:20:24,051
(blows)

329
00:20:24,051 --> 00:20:25,501
Stop that, that's disgusting.

330
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:29,070
Norma, Clive, what is this?

331
00:20:30,049 --> 00:20:31,100
(blows)

332
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:31,933
- Not a thing.

333
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,050
What do you mean?

334
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:38,390
- Norma Jeane, you are all nerved up.

335
00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:39,990
You go into your room right now.

336
00:20:43,381 --> 00:20:44,214
(laughs)

337
00:20:44,214 --> 00:20:45,860
Naughty, giggling little girl.

338
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:49,300
- My mother called Los
Angeles the city of sin.

339
00:20:50,610 --> 00:20:53,237
She said mankind wasn't
meant to live here,

340
00:20:53,237 --> 00:20:57,340
that we were being punished for
our stupidity and our pride.

341
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:59,750
- Norma Jeane, there's fire in the hills.

342
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:01,533
20 feet high.

343
00:21:02,463 --> 00:21:03,740
Fields of fire.

344
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:06,080
Canyons of fire.

345
00:21:07,021 --> 00:21:08,390
I heard it on the radio.

346
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:10,830
Hurry, come on.

347
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:13,353
We'll go to your father's,
we'll be safe there.

348
00:21:13,353 --> 00:21:14,186
- Where?

349
00:21:14,186 --> 00:21:17,500
- Earthquakes, fires,
the air smothering us.

350
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:24,330
Some of us were born here,
and some of us would die here.

351
00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:27,838
It's a pact we made with the devil.

352
00:21:27,838 --> 00:21:30,588
(sirens wailing)

353
00:21:37,554 --> 00:21:42,554
(whistle blowing)
(men chattering)

354
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,680
- Where the hell do
you think you're going?

355
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,110
- I wanna see hell close up.

356
00:21:48,153 --> 00:21:50,070
- Who's that with you?

357
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:52,130
- Well, that's Shirley Temple.

358
00:21:52,130 --> 00:21:54,690
Look, I had been invited
to a private residence

359
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:56,450
at the top of Little Canyon.

360
00:21:56,450 --> 00:21:59,020
The owner has a fireproof mansion,

361
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:02,090
I can't say the man's name,
but it's one that you all know.

362
00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:05,620
He's in the film industry,
and this is his daughter.

363
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:08,900
- Well, I'm sorry ma'am,
you can't go up this road.

364
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:11,050
Why don't you go home, calm down,

365
00:22:11,050 --> 00:22:12,930
and put your little girl to bed.

366
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:14,660
- Don't you condescend to me, Officer,

367
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:16,500
don't you tell me what to do.

368
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,750
- Lady, you're either drunk or doped up,

369
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:21,100
and nobody's got time for it tonight.

370
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:23,530
- Why don't you just shoot me.

371
00:22:27,152 --> 00:22:29,985
(tires squealing)

372
00:22:36,659 --> 00:22:37,855
- Was he here?

373
00:22:37,855 --> 00:22:39,059
Father?

374
00:22:39,059 --> 00:22:40,831
All this time?

375
00:22:40,831 --> 00:22:41,980
Why didn't he come and see us?

376
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:45,895
- You shut up!

377
00:22:45,895 --> 00:22:47,900
It isn't fair.

378
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:50,710
I'm 34 years old.

379
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,970
No man'll look at me anymore.

380
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,610
I've given my youth to the
studio for what, for you!

381
00:22:59,522 --> 00:23:02,030
(knocking)

382
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:02,863
- Norma Jeane.

383
00:23:04,530 --> 00:23:07,970
- Mother called the studio
to tell them she was sick.

384
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:10,840
They were mean, they told
her not to come back to work.

385
00:23:12,977 --> 00:23:14,440
- Unlock the door.

386
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:17,680
- [Norma Jeane] I can't, Mr. Pierce.

387
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,140
She made me promise.

388
00:23:21,690 --> 00:23:23,390
- How long have you been in there?

389
00:23:24,407 --> 00:23:25,640
- Two days.

390
00:23:28,953 --> 00:23:31,210
- I brought you some food.

391
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:34,130
I'll leave it right outside the door.

392
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,233
- Poison.

393
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:46,977
They're trying to poison me.

394
00:23:46,977 --> 00:23:47,955
(plate clatters)

395
00:23:47,955 --> 00:23:50,155
- No Mother, it was
your friend, Mr. Pierce.

396
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:56,000
- Your father gave me
$225 to get rid of you

397
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,350
before you were even born.

398
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:00,190
I should've listened to him.

399
00:24:01,490 --> 00:24:03,420
He loved me before I got pregnant,

400
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:06,280
then after, don't call me,
don't follow me on the street.

401
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:13,020
I have to cleanse you.

402
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,559
- [Norma Jeane] No Mother, please!

403
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:17,900
- [Gladys] You're afflicted.

404
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:19,300
I have to make you clean.

405
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:20,133
- Mother!

406
00:24:20,133 --> 00:24:21,070
- I have to.

407
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:24,110
I have to.

408
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:24,943
You're a freak.

409
00:24:25,995 --> 00:24:29,240
A freak with deformity
disguised as a little girl.

410
00:24:30,375 --> 00:24:32,458
(crying)

411
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,470
It's you.

412
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:38,191
You're the reason your father went away!

413
00:24:38,191 --> 00:24:39,430
He didn't want you!

414
00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:40,263
- Mr. Pierce!

415
00:24:41,490 --> 00:24:42,343
(knocking)

416
00:24:42,343 --> 00:24:43,260
Mr. Pierce!

417
00:24:44,219 --> 00:24:47,579
(bell ringing)

418
00:24:47,579 --> 00:24:52,579
(somber music)
(people chattering)

419
00:24:58,525 --> 00:25:00,716
- [Man] Open up in there, come on!

420
00:25:00,716 --> 00:25:03,012
(banging on door)

421
00:25:03,012 --> 00:25:03,869
- Go away!

422
00:25:03,869 --> 00:25:05,119
Leave me alone!

423
00:25:12,708 --> 00:25:14,701
- You're coming with us now.

424
00:25:14,701 --> 00:25:15,534
- Stop it!

425
00:25:15,534 --> 00:25:17,986
(fire roaring)

426
00:25:17,986 --> 00:25:20,236
(shouting)

427
00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:31,033
There's three more.

428
00:25:35,345 --> 00:25:37,928
(somber music)

429
00:25:40,986 --> 00:25:43,819
(car door closes)

430
00:25:47,985 --> 00:25:49,818
- Please, Norma Jeane.

431
00:25:51,045 --> 00:25:53,194
- You said you were taking
me to see my mother.

432
00:25:53,194 --> 00:25:55,326
- Please, Norma Jeane, be a good girl.

433
00:25:55,326 --> 00:25:56,655
- This is an orphanage!

434
00:25:56,655 --> 00:25:58,100
- Don't kick people, Norma Jeane.

435
00:26:00,009 --> 00:26:01,850
There's nowhere else I can take you.

436
00:26:01,850 --> 00:26:03,130
Your mother is sick.

437
00:26:03,130 --> 00:26:06,240
The doctors say she's very sick.

438
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,840
She tried to hurt you, she can't be

439
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,420
a mother to you right now.

440
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:12,230
Forgive me, Norma Jeane.

441
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:13,080
Ow!

442
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:13,913
Norma Jeane!

443
00:26:15,930 --> 00:26:17,190
Bad girl, very bad.

444
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:25,680
Don't you understand, I feel terrible,

445
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,030
but I can't be your mother.

446
00:26:28,491 --> 00:26:31,270
God knows, I have to work,
I have no money saved.

447
00:26:40,938 --> 00:26:42,282
- This is a mistake.

448
00:26:42,282 --> 00:26:43,240
I have a mother.

449
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:45,420
I have a father.

450
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:47,770
He lives in a big
mansion in Beverly Hills.

451
00:26:47,770 --> 00:26:50,960
- Child, save your
tears, you may need them.

452
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:57,130
- There was a fairy tale I
used to tell Norma Jeane.

453
00:26:57,130 --> 00:26:58,400
I made it up myself.

454
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:01,030
Little girl who sees too much,

455
00:27:01,030 --> 00:27:03,840
little girl who hears too much.

456
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:09,900
A crow comes to peck out her eyes,

457
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:12,750
a big fish comes to gobble up her ears,

458
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:15,820
a red fox bites off her nose.

459
00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:22,586
See what happens, Miss?

460
00:27:22,586 --> 00:27:25,336
(girls shouting)

461
00:27:32,273 --> 00:27:34,273
(gasps)

462
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:42,740
- Smells like smoke.

463
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:44,553
What happened?

464
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,140
Where do you wear these?

465
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:48,718
Movie star clothes.

466
00:27:48,718 --> 00:27:51,468
(girls laughing)

467
00:27:52,522 --> 00:27:53,822
Look at me, Ginger Rogers.

468
00:27:54,802 --> 00:27:57,552
(girls laughing)

469
00:28:01,453 --> 00:28:04,910
Why you holding that freaky thing?

470
00:28:04,910 --> 00:28:05,743
A little mouse.

471
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:08,620
Cat got your tongue?

472
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:10,080
Little orphan girl?

473
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,990
- I'm not an orphan.

474
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:13,880
My mother's in the hospital.

475
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:17,413
My father lives in a big
mansion in Beverly Hills.

476
00:28:17,413 --> 00:28:18,660
- That's bull.

477
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:20,114
Liar.
(bell ringing)

478
00:28:20,114 --> 00:28:22,710
Your mother and father are
dead, just like everybody else.

479
00:28:22,710 --> 00:28:23,660
Everybody's dead.

480
00:28:30,193 --> 00:28:35,193
(somber music)
(insects chirping)

481
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:49,760
- [Man] And Clara and her prince

482
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,880
sailed home in a magic sleigh.

483
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:54,460
- And they lived happily ever after.

484
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:55,524
The end.

485
00:28:55,524 --> 00:28:59,024
(cheering and applauding)

486
00:29:00,183 --> 00:29:01,840
Merry Christmas, dear children.

487
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,595
Now we have presents for everybody!

488
00:29:03,595 --> 00:29:05,408
(girls shouting)

489
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:06,548
- [Man] This is yours.

490
00:29:06,548 --> 00:29:07,381
Here you go.

491
00:29:07,381 --> 00:29:09,399
- And this one's for you.

492
00:29:09,399 --> 00:29:13,208
- A fairy princess and a dark prince.

493
00:29:13,208 --> 00:29:14,395
- What?

494
00:29:14,395 --> 00:29:15,504
- Don't you know?

495
00:29:15,504 --> 00:29:19,680
Movie stars.

496
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:20,630
- Come on up stage.

497
00:29:21,625 --> 00:29:22,458
Oh come on, you'll be all right.

498
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,140
- Hi.

499
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:26,973
- [Photographer] There you
go, that's a great one.

500
00:29:27,924 --> 00:29:28,757
I gotta get one.

501
00:29:28,757 --> 00:29:29,932
- Come on honey, a nice smile.

502
00:29:29,932 --> 00:29:30,860
- [Photographer] Give us a big smile.

503
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:33,010
Come on sweetie, let's see it.

504
00:29:34,304 --> 00:29:37,020
Oh, look at that, beautiful.

505
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:38,070
All right, hold that.

506
00:29:40,429 --> 00:29:41,870
- Open your present, darling.

507
00:29:43,641 --> 00:29:45,070
What is that?

508
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:46,940
- A baby tiger, mine.

509
00:29:55,075 --> 00:29:56,825
Where are you, Daddy?

510
00:29:58,036 --> 00:30:00,200
If I was prettier, would you come for me?

511
00:30:02,011 --> 00:30:04,120
(somber music)

512
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:08,130
Someone come to take me away,
so I'll never be sad again.

513
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:21,343
You.

514
00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:24,320
You could be my magic friend.

515
00:30:29,131 --> 00:30:32,048
(girls chattering)

516
00:30:39,224 --> 00:30:42,010
- You're a very hard worker, Norma Jeane.

517
00:30:42,010 --> 00:30:45,060
You must know that cleanliness
is next to godliness.

518
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:48,523
- My mother doesn't believe in God.

519
00:30:48,523 --> 00:30:52,510
- Perhaps your mother's
mind has been poisoned.

520
00:30:53,815 --> 00:30:56,330
I believe that a person can surmount

521
00:30:56,330 --> 00:30:59,240
any of life's challenges
through hard work and prayer.

522
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:02,830
Without drugs, without alcohol.

523
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:04,692
- I will never take drugs.

524
00:31:04,692 --> 00:31:06,090
I will never, ever drink.

525
00:31:07,499 --> 00:31:09,890
- I have some books you
might find interesting.

526
00:31:11,018 --> 00:31:13,118
You have an inquisitive mind, Norma Jeane.

527
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:14,793
Put it to use.

528
00:31:21,404 --> 00:31:23,987
(bell ringing)

529
00:31:30,210 --> 00:31:32,100
- [Woman] She looks just
like our Cynthia Rose.

530
00:31:32,970 --> 00:31:35,552
- Mr. And Mrs. Mount lost
their little daughter

531
00:31:35,552 --> 00:31:36,980
when she was eight years old.

532
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:38,362
- Polio.

533
00:31:38,362 --> 00:31:39,550
We have a picture.

534
00:31:46,930 --> 00:31:47,900
- [Norma Jeane] Pretty.

535
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:50,090
- Norma Jeane, why don't you recite

536
00:31:50,090 --> 00:31:52,090
one of your poems for these nice people?

537
00:31:53,050 --> 00:31:54,590
Norma Jeane's become quite a poet

538
00:31:54,590 --> 00:31:56,910
while she's been staying with us.

539
00:31:56,910 --> 00:31:58,070
- Poet.

540
00:31:58,070 --> 00:31:59,710
On top of everything else.

541
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:01,010
Oh yes, we'd love to hear.

542
00:32:03,390 --> 00:32:05,960
- Where do you go when you disappear?

543
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:08,650
Wherever you are, are you alone?

544
00:32:08,650 --> 00:32:12,790
You can endure any pain, if
you have a family and a home.

545
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:18,050
- Darling, we have a home for you.

546
00:32:18,050 --> 00:32:20,390
A beautiful home in Pasadena.

547
00:32:20,390 --> 00:32:22,120
There's a room just for you.

548
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:24,510
It's pale pink and there's
a canopy over the bed.

549
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:29,160
- Norma Jeane, would you
like to live with us?

550
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,850
- Yes, can I be Cynthia Rose?

551
00:32:35,426 --> 00:32:38,176
(birds chirping)

552
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:41,362
- I'm sorry, Norma Jeane.

553
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:44,710
I know your mother loves you, dear,

554
00:32:44,710 --> 00:32:46,010
and wants you to be happy.

555
00:32:47,498 --> 00:32:51,890
But she refuses to sign
the adoption papers again.

556
00:32:52,851 --> 00:32:54,620
- It isn't fair, Dr. Mittelstadt.

557
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:57,980
My mother, she's sick and she's crazy.

558
00:32:57,980 --> 00:32:59,170
- Norma Jeane.

559
00:32:59,170 --> 00:33:02,940
- This is the third time I had
a chance to be in a family.

560
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:05,050
I did everything you said.

561
00:33:05,050 --> 00:33:08,100
I wrote to my mother, I begged her,

562
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:09,770
I prayed and prayed and prayed.

563
00:33:09,770 --> 00:33:12,680
- Prayer cannot change
the science of being.

564
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:15,830
It only brings us in
better harmony with it.

565
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:17,130
- Then what good is it?

566
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:21,030
- My mother didn't know
how to be a mother to me.

567
00:33:22,901 --> 00:33:26,330
But she didn't want anyone
else to be my mother,

568
00:33:26,330 --> 00:33:30,650
so Dr. Mittelstadt promised
to find me a foster home.

569
00:33:32,490 --> 00:33:34,760
We didn't need my mother's
permission for that.

570
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,290
A foster home, didn't make any difference.

571
00:33:40,290 --> 00:33:45,290
Any home, any home at all.

572
00:33:45,930 --> 00:33:49,250
Well, Norma Jeane, we will miss you.

573
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:52,790
- Yes, I will miss all of you.

574
00:33:52,790 --> 00:33:54,690
- The Perigs are a good foster family.

575
00:33:55,595 --> 00:33:57,980
You'll be going to school in Van Ives.

576
00:33:57,980 --> 00:34:00,350
And if things work out
well, you'll be able

577
00:34:00,350 --> 00:34:02,050
to live with them until you're 18.

578
00:34:02,890 --> 00:34:04,090
Then you're on your own.

579
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:08,352
Now, there's $20.60 in your account.

580
00:34:08,352 --> 00:34:13,299
As a going away gift,
I've doubled that sum.

581
00:34:13,299 --> 00:34:15,980
- Thank you.

582
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:18,390
- Remember us with kindness, Norma Jeane.

583
00:34:26,523 --> 00:34:29,273
(birds chirping)

584
00:34:36,932 --> 00:34:41,932
(upbeat jazz music)
(door opens)

585
00:34:48,862 --> 00:34:50,710
- Oh, Norma Jeane, let
me take that from you.

586
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:52,237
- Oh--

587
00:34:52,237 --> 00:34:54,560
- No, honey, honey, you do
enough around here already.

588
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:55,510
Doesn't she Warren?

589
00:34:56,372 --> 00:34:57,220
- Yeah.

590
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:59,980
- Yeah, you always keep
your room so neat and tidy,

591
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:01,210
and look at you, you always look like

592
00:35:01,210 --> 00:35:02,945
you just stepped out of the bathtub.

593
00:35:02,945 --> 00:35:04,088
(Norma Jeane laughs)

594
00:35:04,088 --> 00:35:06,490
Here, why don't you have a seat
and let me fix you a plate.

595
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:18,330
This is a big day for you.

596
00:35:18,330 --> 00:35:20,730
- You don't have to
wait on me, Aunt Elsie.

597
00:35:20,730 --> 00:35:22,250
- Did you memorize your play?

598
00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:24,750
- Yeah, I worked on it
practically all night,

599
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:28,090
I'm so nervous, Aunt
Elsie, my head, my stomach.

600
00:35:30,481 --> 00:35:31,610
- Do you need an aspirin?

601
00:35:31,610 --> 00:35:35,660
- No, I'll be fine, I just
gotta set my mind to it.

602
00:35:36,602 --> 00:35:38,300
- You always say that.

603
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:39,450
It doesn't work for me.

604
00:35:40,550 --> 00:35:42,752
Maybe it's because I
only have half a mind.

605
00:35:42,752 --> 00:35:45,419
(both laughing)

606
00:35:47,002 --> 00:35:48,585
- What's in a name?

607
00:35:49,756 --> 00:35:51,650
That which we call a
rose by any other name

608
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:52,700
would smell as sweet.

609
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:56,640
So Romeo would, were he not Romeo called,

610
00:35:57,660 --> 00:36:00,196
retain that dear perfection which he owes

611
00:36:00,196 --> 00:36:02,680
without that title.

612
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:05,880
Romeo, doth thy name and for thy name,

613
00:36:07,050 --> 00:36:09,570
which is no part of thee, take all myself.

614
00:36:12,565 --> 00:36:14,836
(sighs)

615
00:36:14,836 --> 00:36:17,170
Thank you, magic friend.

616
00:36:17,170 --> 00:36:18,380
Thank you.

617
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:19,630
- Next.

618
00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:20,470
Who's next?

619
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:25,130
(whispering)

620
00:36:25,130 --> 00:36:26,020
Norma Jeane.

621
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:48,340
- What's in a name?

622
00:36:49,850 --> 00:36:51,870
A name by any other rose...

623
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:59,200
A rose by any other name
would smell as sweet,

624
00:36:59,330 --> 00:37:00,940
so to...

625
00:37:02,710 --> 00:37:04,270
I'm sorry, could I start again?

626
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:11,460
No, see, I think I could be
Juliet, I know, I am Juliet.

627
00:37:12,176 --> 00:37:15,340
(students laughing)

628
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:20,340
- Thank you, Norma Jeane, but
I don't think the playwright

629
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:24,198
Mr. William Shakespeare
would've seen it that way.

630
00:37:24,198 --> 00:37:27,198
(students laughing)

631
00:37:28,852 --> 00:37:29,685
(crying)

632
00:37:29,685 --> 00:37:32,132
- This all may seem important
to you now, Norma Jeane.

633
00:37:32,132 --> 00:37:36,460
Someday you'll laugh about it.

634
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:39,370
- I couldn't even make
it as a cheerleader.

635
00:37:39,370 --> 00:37:41,870
- That's because you're a
poet, not a cheerleader.

636
00:37:44,151 --> 00:37:45,670
- Do you mean that, Mr. Herring?

637
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:48,630
- I've read your poems.

638
00:37:50,546 --> 00:37:51,600
They're very good.

639
00:37:52,790 --> 00:37:53,900
Good rhyming.

640
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:57,040
- I have lots of them, hundreds
of them, I love poetry.

641
00:37:58,462 --> 00:37:59,782
- Well bring them in.

642
00:37:59,782 --> 00:38:00,910
I'm happy to read them.

643
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:05,720
- I wanna write poetry like
Edna St. Vincent Millay,

644
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:07,720
or Robert Browning.

645
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:10,600
Oh, Mr. Herring, I wanna learn.

646
00:38:18,987 --> 00:38:22,946
And my mother, she was a
film actress for the studio,

647
00:38:22,946 --> 00:38:26,050
she was an understudy for Joan
Crawford and Gloria Swanson.

648
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:29,800
Well she died in an airplane
crash over the Atlantic

649
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:34,800
in 1934, and there was no
one to take me in, so--

650
00:38:35,250 --> 00:38:37,550
- Life must be very
difficult for a young girl

651
00:38:38,546 --> 00:38:40,610
like yourself, Norma Jeane.

652
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:43,180
- I love the way you say my name.

653
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:46,561
It makes me feel magical.

654
00:38:46,561 --> 00:38:50,190
You can kiss me, but only
with your mouth closed.

655
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:58,290
Thank you, Mr. Herring, you're
the most wonderful teacher

656
00:38:58,290 --> 00:38:59,680
in the whole wide world.

657
00:39:08,739 --> 00:39:10,075
(light music)

658
00:39:10,075 --> 00:39:12,909
(insects chirping)

659
00:39:12,909 --> 00:39:13,826
This is me.

660
00:39:18,772 --> 00:39:20,210
Well, just a little kiss.

661
00:39:21,849 --> 00:39:24,567
Not the kind with your mouth open.

662
00:39:30,661 --> 00:39:32,990
Bye.

663
00:39:44,455 --> 00:39:46,850
- What is it, Warren?

664
00:39:46,850 --> 00:39:47,870
- Nothing.

665
00:39:47,870 --> 00:39:50,040
- Norma Jeane wasn't the
one to blame for this.

666
00:39:51,770 --> 00:39:53,370
My husband was the one to blame.

667
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:57,540
And even that poor bastard
was halfway innocent.

668
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:00,100
Maybe even helpless.

669
00:40:02,890 --> 00:40:03,810
Have to face it.

670
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:06,190
It's a man's world.

671
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:12,060
And to survive, a woman
must betray her own kind.

672
00:40:15,475 --> 00:40:16,580
A woman has to protect herself

673
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:18,180
against a girl like Norma Jeane.

674
00:40:24,705 --> 00:40:25,538
(birds chirping)

675
00:40:25,538 --> 00:40:27,310
Norma Jeane, I been
thinking about something.

676
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,630
It's time that you got married.

677
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:32,860
- What?

678
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:35,439
- Well you know, you're
gonna be 16 in June.

679
00:40:35,439 --> 00:40:37,630
And that's about the time I got married.

680
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:40,740
- But I don't have a steady boyfriend.

681
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:43,650
- You have too many boyfriends.

682
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:46,120
- But I'm not in love.

683
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:47,950
- At your age it's easy to get in love.

684
00:40:49,510 --> 00:40:53,533
And say, Norma Jeane, I've been hearing

685
00:40:53,533 --> 00:40:56,280
some things about you lately.

686
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:58,080
- Oh, you mean Mr. Herring, my teacher?

687
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,620
I'm not seeing him anymore, Aunt Elsie,

688
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:02,150
I didn't know he was married, I swear.

689
00:41:02,150 --> 00:41:03,640
- With this terrible war starting

690
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:06,500
and all of our young
boys going off to fight,

691
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:07,940
you better grab yourself a husband

692
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:10,410
while there's still one
available and in one piece.

693
00:41:11,828 --> 00:41:14,200
(lighter clicking)

694
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:17,560
- You're serious, you're not joking?

695
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:19,750
- Do I look like I'm joking?

696
00:41:19,750 --> 00:41:20,583
Does Hitler?

697
00:41:22,823 --> 00:41:25,950
- But I still have two
years of high school to go.

698
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:29,590
- Honey, you don't need
a diploma to get married.

699
00:41:29,590 --> 00:41:32,100
- But I'm too young, Aunt Elsie.

700
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:33,250
I don't wanna get married.

701
00:41:33,250 --> 00:41:35,170
I wanna be a nurse, with the war going on

702
00:41:35,170 --> 00:41:36,210
I can help all the suffering--

703
00:41:36,210 --> 00:41:37,360
- We don't have the room anymore,

704
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:39,030
my sister and her kids
are gonna come here--

705
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:40,640
- I don't need an actual room, I mean,

706
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:43,000
I could sleep on the sofa, or in the car.

707
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,880
Aunt Elsie, I'll do anything,
I'll work harder Aunt Elsie--

708
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:47,270
- Honey, you do work hard.

709
00:41:47,270 --> 00:41:49,070
- Please don't send me back
to the home, Aunt Elsie,

710
00:41:49,070 --> 00:41:51,110
I'll kill myself, I will.

711
00:41:51,110 --> 00:41:52,184
- Stop it.

712
00:41:52,184 --> 00:41:53,940
(Norma Jeane crying)

713
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:54,990
Crying never helps.

714
00:41:57,967 --> 00:41:59,920
If it did, we'd all be a
lot better off, wouldn't we?

715
00:42:01,030 --> 00:42:03,070
- Why do you want to get rid of her?

716
00:42:03,070 --> 00:42:04,920
She helps you around
the house, doesn't she?

717
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:05,753
- Mm-hmm.

718
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:08,390
- She's a good kid.

719
00:42:09,519 --> 00:42:12,169
- Well we certainly don't
her to end up like Lucille.

720
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:17,680
15, pregnant, that boy
just ran out on her.

721
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:20,820
- So what, you're just gonna
send her back to County?

722
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:21,920
Back to the orphanage?

723
00:42:22,970 --> 00:42:23,803
- No.

724
00:42:24,895 --> 00:42:27,640
I'm gonna get that little girl
married, outta here and safe.

725
00:42:32,471 --> 00:42:33,304
Ba ba.

726
00:42:33,304 --> 00:42:37,930
- I'm sorry, Aunt Elsie,
I'm just scared I guess.

727
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:39,610
- Oh, I understand, honey.

728
00:42:39,610 --> 00:42:41,320
But you'll get over it.

729
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:43,751
Wait till you see this boy.

730
00:42:43,751 --> 00:42:45,430
He's so cute.

731
00:42:45,430 --> 00:42:46,330
And a hard worker.

732
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:49,590
He works at Lockheed now,
but I think after the war

733
00:42:49,590 --> 00:42:51,731
he'll probably have his own business.

734
00:42:51,731 --> 00:42:55,880
- I wish I could go to the
war, I wish I was a man.

735
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:57,447
- You?

736
00:42:57,447 --> 00:42:59,187
You can't even watch me clean a chicken.

737
00:42:59,187 --> 00:43:01,550
(laughs)

738
00:43:01,550 --> 00:43:02,450
Oh, this war.

739
00:43:03,710 --> 00:43:06,300
It is getting so bad in Europe.

740
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:10,180
All the young boys have enlisted now.

741
00:43:10,180 --> 00:43:13,190
You wanna have babies, don't you?

742
00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:14,200
- Babies?

743
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:16,120
- Time's running out.

744
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:20,835
- Well, if I had a baby, I
would never be alone, would I?

745
00:43:20,835 --> 00:43:22,235
- That's right, Norma Jeane.

746
00:43:23,170 --> 00:43:25,090
You'd never be alone.

747
00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:27,680
This is for your own good, baby.

748
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:29,834
You have to grow up sometime.

749
00:43:29,834 --> 00:43:32,880
I guess if your number's
up, Aunt Elsie, it's up.

750
00:43:33,910 --> 00:43:35,290
- Yeah.

751
00:43:35,290 --> 00:43:37,010
- She's a good Christian
girl and she doesn't

752
00:43:37,010 --> 00:43:37,843
drink or smoke.

753
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:41,520
She reads the Bible, and
she's a born homemaker.

754
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:45,120
You have to go overseas, you're gonna need

755
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:46,420
someone to come home to.

756
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:49,100
- Mom.

757
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:51,060
Got you to come home to, right?

758
00:43:51,060 --> 00:43:52,420
And write to me?

759
00:43:52,420 --> 00:43:54,840
Why would I need anybody else?

760
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:57,020
- Now Bucky, you just promise me.

761
00:43:58,660 --> 00:43:59,610
Just be nice.

762
00:44:01,296 --> 00:44:03,170
- Okay.

763
00:44:05,185 --> 00:44:06,770
- Hi Bess, how are you?

764
00:44:06,770 --> 00:44:08,100
Good, good to see you.

765
00:44:09,675 --> 00:44:14,675
Go ahead.

766
00:44:21,060 --> 00:44:22,610
- Hi.

767
00:44:22,610 --> 00:44:23,443
I'm Bucky.

768
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:26,880
- I'm Norma Jeane.

769
00:44:27,859 --> 00:44:31,640
- Well, Norma Jeane,
you're the prettiest girl

770
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:33,319
I've seen outside the movies.

771
00:44:33,319 --> 00:44:34,830
(laughs)

772
00:44:34,830 --> 00:44:37,230
I'm beginning to believe
in love at first sight.

773
00:44:39,629 --> 00:44:41,267
(Norma Jeane laughs)

774
00:44:41,267 --> 00:44:43,451
(soft jazz music)

775
00:44:43,451 --> 00:44:46,451
(people chattering)

776
00:45:04,564 --> 00:45:06,814
(laughing)

777
00:45:07,798 --> 00:45:09,420
- What did your family say when they saw

778
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:11,670
my birth certificate, father unknown?

779
00:45:11,670 --> 00:45:14,460
- Don't give it another thought, honey.

780
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:16,070
No Glazer's gonna look down on somebody

781
00:45:16,070 --> 00:45:17,530
for reasons that can't be helped.

782
00:45:17,530 --> 00:45:19,316
I'll punch 'em in the nose if they do.

783
00:45:19,316 --> 00:45:20,516
(laughs)

784
00:45:20,516 --> 00:45:21,450
Thank you.

785
00:45:21,450 --> 00:45:22,630
- Ooh, I think I've had enough,

786
00:45:22,630 --> 00:45:24,270
I've never had champagne before.

787
00:45:25,138 --> 00:45:27,011
- Oh, hey!
(Norma Jean squeals)

788
00:45:27,011 --> 00:45:28,178
- [Man] Sorry.

789
00:45:29,250 --> 00:45:30,452
(Bucky laughing)

790
00:45:30,452 --> 00:45:31,545
Easy.

791
00:45:31,545 --> 00:45:33,462
Look, I said I'm sorry.

792
00:45:39,990 --> 00:45:41,010
- Oh dear.

793
00:45:42,140 --> 00:45:43,890
And Bucky's sister was kind enough

794
00:45:43,890 --> 00:45:45,510
to let you borrow her dress.

795
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,912
Just like the movies, huh?

796
00:45:48,912 --> 00:45:51,620
- I just wish my mother
could've been here.

797
00:45:51,620 --> 00:45:53,708
I sent her an invitation, but--

798
00:45:53,708 --> 00:45:55,852
- Well, you never have
to fret about that again.

799
00:45:55,852 --> 00:45:57,324
Now you have a mother-in-law.

800
00:45:57,324 --> 00:45:59,572
(laughs)

801
00:45:59,572 --> 00:46:01,252
- Oh, Aunt Elsie, I'm frightened.

802
00:46:01,252 --> 00:46:03,102
I mean, I'm frightened about tonight.

803
00:46:04,044 --> 00:46:05,320
- Oh honey, don't be frightened.

804
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:08,708
All you have to do really
is stay outta their way.

805
00:46:08,708 --> 00:46:10,791
(laughs)

806
00:46:12,535 --> 00:46:15,543
I wish I coulda kicked
Warren out and kept you.

807
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:28,680
- Are you happy?

808
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:29,513
Huh?

809
00:46:29,513 --> 00:46:30,346
Are you happy?

810
00:46:30,346 --> 00:46:34,520
- Yes, it's the happiest
day of my whole life.

811
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:44,780
Bucky, I love you, I love
you, now my life is perfect.

812
00:46:56,889 --> 00:46:57,969
Daddy.

813
00:46:57,969 --> 00:46:59,753
You'll never leave me, will you?

814
00:46:59,753 --> 00:47:00,761
- Baby, why would I leave you?

815
00:47:00,761 --> 00:47:02,320
I just married you.

816
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:07,120
- It kinda smells in
here like insect spray.

817
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:08,691
It's cruel.

818
00:47:08,691 --> 00:47:11,010
The way they kill them that
way is cruel, don't you think?

819
00:47:11,010 --> 00:47:12,680
- I'm only thinking of one thing.

820
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:13,990
- Wait, just let me get my nightgown.

821
00:47:13,990 --> 00:47:14,940
- No, no nightgown.

822
00:47:16,133 --> 00:47:17,333
I been dreaming of this.

823
00:47:18,410 --> 00:47:20,333
Aww jeez, baby, I love you so much.

824
00:47:20,333 --> 00:47:24,213
You're so good, and so
sweet, and so beautiful.

825
00:47:24,213 --> 00:47:26,333
- You do love me, don't you Bucky?

826
00:47:26,333 --> 00:47:31,333
And I'm married, and I'm never
gonna be alone again, right?

827
00:47:36,608 --> 00:47:41,608
â™ª Bye-O baby buns, your
daddy's gone a-hunting â™ª

828
00:47:42,658 --> 00:47:47,658
â™ª To catch a little rabbit skin
to wrap my little baby in â™ª

829
00:47:49,566 --> 00:47:51,980
(humming)

830
00:47:51,980 --> 00:47:54,789
- Beautiful baby, and beautiful mother.

831
00:47:54,789 --> 00:47:55,710
(laughs)

832
00:47:55,710 --> 00:47:57,870
What is your little girl's name?

833
00:47:57,870 --> 00:47:58,870
- Arina.

834
00:47:58,870 --> 00:47:59,980
Aren't you, honey?

835
00:47:59,980 --> 00:48:00,920
Aren't you?

836
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:02,870
- [Woman] You must be very proud.

837
00:48:02,870 --> 00:48:03,940
- Yes I am.

838
00:48:03,940 --> 00:48:06,240
I mean, we both are.

839
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:07,550
- Is your husband?

840
00:48:07,550 --> 00:48:11,660
- He's overseas, far away in New Guinea.

841
00:48:11,660 --> 00:48:13,743
(laughs)

842
00:48:15,154 --> 00:48:18,071
(light jazz music)

843
00:48:23,250 --> 00:48:24,946
Hi Harriet.

844
00:48:24,946 --> 00:48:25,779
We're back.

845
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:29,040
Arina and I had a lovely walk, didn't we?

846
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:30,570
Come on.

847
00:48:30,570 --> 00:48:32,510
Oh, oh, aww.

848
00:48:32,510 --> 00:48:34,628
We did, didn't we, we had a nice--

849
00:48:34,628 --> 00:48:35,461
(baby crying)

850
00:48:35,461 --> 00:48:36,294
Oh no.

851
00:48:36,294 --> 00:48:37,127
Look at your mommy.

852
00:48:39,030 --> 00:48:40,660
Don't cry.

853
00:48:40,660 --> 00:48:42,250
You know, I'll tend to her anytime,

854
00:48:42,250 --> 00:48:44,520
I mean I just love to, I do.

855
00:48:45,649 --> 00:48:47,120
How's tomorrow morning?

856
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:49,260
Would that be all right?

857
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:51,520
You know what, I'll see you
tomorrow morning, Harriet.

858
00:48:57,460 --> 00:49:00,180
- See, I don't know if
I'm gonna go for the Navy,

859
00:49:00,180 --> 00:49:02,020
the Marines, or the Merchant Marines,

860
00:49:02,020 --> 00:49:04,220
but God made the US
number one for a reason,

861
00:49:04,220 --> 00:49:05,800
and we gotta uphold that responsibility.

862
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:07,660
- Well what if bombs ever
fall on this country?

863
00:49:07,660 --> 00:49:10,880
I mean, what would happen to
us, what would be our fate?

864
00:49:12,050 --> 00:49:13,650
- Our fate?

865
00:49:13,650 --> 00:49:15,333
You use such weird words sometimes.

866
00:49:15,333 --> 00:49:16,635
(laughs)

867
00:49:16,635 --> 00:49:17,468
Don't worry about it.

868
00:49:17,468 --> 00:49:18,720
If the Japs try to bomb the US,

869
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:19,990
we will blast them out of the sky

870
00:49:19,990 --> 00:49:22,420
with the secrete missiles
that we're making at Lockheed.

871
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:26,670
You know, some of the women
whose husbands are overseas

872
00:49:26,670 --> 00:49:28,280
have started working for the war effort,

873
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:29,250
and I was thinking that--

874
00:49:29,250 --> 00:49:31,320
- Glazer women don't
work outside of the home.

875
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:34,250
- But it's war time, isn't that different?

876
00:49:34,250 --> 00:49:35,780
- No wife of mine, ever.

877
00:49:38,780 --> 00:49:39,990
- More macaroni and cheese?

878
00:49:39,990 --> 00:49:42,529
We have potatoes and biscuits,

879
00:49:42,529 --> 00:49:45,890
I got tapioca pudding with
bananas and whipped cream.

880
00:49:45,890 --> 00:49:47,210
You liked it, didn't you Daddy?

881
00:49:47,210 --> 00:49:49,240
I mean, I just wanna be the best wife

882
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:50,650
in the whole world, I do.

883
00:49:50,650 --> 00:49:53,550
- No, it was delicious,
it was really good.

884
00:49:53,550 --> 00:49:55,960
But you know how that
white food kinda bloats me.

885
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:58,110
- Oh, there was ketchup Daddy, that's red.

886
00:49:59,110 --> 00:50:01,040
Oh, look what I made for Arina.

887
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:03,820
I made it out of a sock
and some black felt,

888
00:50:03,820 --> 00:50:06,813
it's just like the one I got
for Christmas at the orphanage.

889
00:50:06,813 --> 00:50:08,230
It's cute, huh? (laughs)

890
00:50:08,230 --> 00:50:09,870
- You got nothing else to do around here

891
00:50:09,870 --> 00:50:12,460
except for tending somebody else's kid?

892
00:50:12,460 --> 00:50:15,020
- Well, I just feel sorry for them,

893
00:50:15,020 --> 00:50:17,870
I mean Harriet's husband
is missing in action--

894
00:50:17,870 --> 00:50:19,577
- Enough about Harriet.

895
00:50:19,577 --> 00:50:20,410
- What?

896
00:50:20,410 --> 00:50:22,446
- I got you, baby.
(Norma Jeane squeals)

897
00:50:22,446 --> 00:50:24,790
(laughing)

898
00:50:24,790 --> 00:50:26,460
- Oh, she loves it.

899
00:50:26,460 --> 00:50:28,180
See, I used little black buttons for eyes.

900
00:50:28,180 --> 00:50:31,410
Oh, Harriet, if I had a Arina, I would be

901
00:50:31,410 --> 00:50:34,010
the happiest girl in the whole world!

902
00:50:34,010 --> 00:50:34,843
I would!

903
00:50:38,504 --> 00:50:41,254
(men chattering)

904
00:50:44,630 --> 00:50:45,480
- Listen to this.

905
00:50:46,610 --> 00:50:48,340
When you read this, Big Daddy,

906
00:50:48,340 --> 00:50:50,180
think of Baby Doll and the red hot loving

907
00:50:50,180 --> 00:50:52,479
she's gonna give you when
you come home tonight.

908
00:50:52,479 --> 00:50:54,190
(laughing)
- Big Daddy.

909
00:50:54,190 --> 00:50:55,830
- She's always leaving notes in my lunch.

910
00:50:55,830 --> 00:50:58,860
She cooks and cleans and
scrubs everything all day.

911
00:50:58,860 --> 00:51:01,010
She's so neat, and pretty.

912
00:51:01,010 --> 00:51:02,310
She even writes me poetry.

913
00:51:03,410 --> 00:51:05,060
- This is better than any poetry.

914
00:51:06,020 --> 00:51:07,020
Take a look at this.

915
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:09,113
My girl.

916
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:12,320
- Not as sexy as my Norma Jeane.

917
00:51:13,190 --> 00:51:15,349
I mean, if she had that kinda underwear.

918
00:51:15,349 --> 00:51:17,599
(laughing)

919
00:51:20,133 --> 00:51:21,693
(laughs)

920
00:51:21,693 --> 00:51:22,690
- All this makeup.

921
00:51:22,690 --> 00:51:24,450
- Oh, shh, come on, be a sport.

922
00:51:25,549 --> 00:51:28,540
I want the guys to see
how beautiful my wife is.

923
00:51:28,540 --> 00:51:29,640
Okay, smile for Daddy.

924
00:51:31,346 --> 00:51:33,930
Put your arm behind your head like this.

925
00:51:33,930 --> 00:51:35,920
See, that's what they call a glamour shot.

926
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:37,744
You like to look glamorous, huh?

927
00:51:37,744 --> 00:51:39,214
(laughing)

928
00:51:39,214 --> 00:51:42,047
(camera clicking)

929
00:51:45,460 --> 00:51:47,740
- Daddy, come on, that's enough.

930
00:51:47,740 --> 00:51:50,200
It's lonely here in this
big old bed by myself.

931
00:51:51,503 --> 00:51:53,794
(camera clicking)

932
00:51:53,794 --> 00:51:54,842
- [Bucky] That's good now.

933
00:51:54,842 --> 00:51:58,730
- Daddy, I don't wanna,
it doesn't feel right,

934
00:51:58,730 --> 00:52:01,901
I mean, I just, this
wig, and this makeup, I--

935
00:52:01,901 --> 00:52:03,990
- No no, you likey, you likey, you like it

936
00:52:03,990 --> 00:52:05,871
because it makes me hot.

937
00:52:05,871 --> 00:52:07,890
Don't, it's fun, it's fun.

938
00:52:07,890 --> 00:52:10,680
- No, Bucky, no, see, it's not fun.

939
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:12,210
- Come on, would you loosen up?

940
00:52:12,210 --> 00:52:14,460
Guys do things like this with
their wives all the time.

941
00:52:14,460 --> 00:52:15,530
There's no harm in it.

942
00:52:15,530 --> 00:52:17,980
- I just, I don't like
looking like this, I mean,

943
00:52:19,491 --> 00:52:21,260
it makes me not know who I am.

944
00:52:22,184 --> 00:52:24,100
I thought you loved me.

945
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:27,580
- You know, sometimes I don't think

946
00:52:27,580 --> 00:52:29,100
you feel much in your body.

947
00:52:29,100 --> 00:52:29,933
- What?

948
00:52:29,933 --> 00:52:31,180
- The way a woman is supposed to feel.

949
00:52:31,180 --> 00:52:34,124
- No, Bucky, I didn't mean it, I'm just,

950
00:52:34,124 --> 00:52:38,670
I'm sorry, I'm getting my period
and I have terrible cramps,

951
00:52:38,670 --> 00:52:40,670
and I'll pose--
- Then take an aspirin.

952
00:52:43,030 --> 00:52:44,880
- No, Bucky, wait.

953
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:47,199
- This is strictly confidential, okay?

954
00:52:47,199 --> 00:52:49,130
Not to go beyond us.

955
00:52:51,660 --> 00:52:52,660
- This is your wife?

956
00:52:53,554 --> 00:52:55,940
Glazer, you're one lucky bastard.

957
00:52:56,810 --> 00:52:58,540
- Man, if I had a wife
that looked like this,

958
00:52:58,540 --> 00:53:01,301
I wouldn't be showing
her pictures to nobody.

959
00:53:01,301 --> 00:53:03,020
I'd be putting her under lock and key.

960
00:53:03,020 --> 00:53:05,290
- Ah, well, I don't have
to worry about that.

961
00:53:06,338 --> 00:53:08,150
Norma Jeane's only got eyes for me.

962
00:53:10,578 --> 00:53:13,290
(knocking)

963
00:53:13,290 --> 00:53:14,123
- Harriet?

964
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:21,180
- Harriet left last night.

965
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:24,050
She packed up Arina and took off.

966
00:53:24,050 --> 00:53:26,150
She said she wasn't cut out to be a widow.

967
00:53:27,077 --> 00:53:28,721
(laughs)

968
00:53:28,721 --> 00:53:31,120
- She wouldn't leave
without saying goodbye,

969
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:33,620
without having Arina say
goodbye, she wouldn't--

970
00:53:33,620 --> 00:53:35,080
- Well she would and she did.

971
00:53:35,080 --> 00:53:36,660
- She would not.

972
00:53:36,660 --> 00:53:38,120
God wouldn't let her.

973
00:53:42,399 --> 00:53:45,209
(insects chirping)

974
00:53:45,209 --> 00:53:47,792
(somber music)

975
00:53:58,575 --> 00:54:01,075
(baby crying)

976
00:54:14,266 --> 00:54:16,266
(gasps)

977
00:54:24,231 --> 00:54:25,398
- Norma Jeane?

978
00:54:34,539 --> 00:54:36,789
Norma Jeane, you mopped
this floor yesterday.

979
00:54:41,510 --> 00:54:42,343
Listen honey.

980
00:54:43,870 --> 00:54:46,110
I enlisted this morning
in the Merchant Marines.

981
00:54:48,300 --> 00:54:50,180
And we both knew that this was coming.

982
00:54:51,550 --> 00:54:53,400
Probably be shipped out in six weeks.

983
00:54:54,490 --> 00:54:55,790
I have to serve my country.

984
00:54:55,790 --> 00:54:57,740
May sound corny, but that's how I feel.

985
00:55:00,546 --> 00:55:01,463
- Oh Bucky.

986
00:55:03,381 --> 00:55:04,214
- Dear God.

987
00:55:06,010 --> 00:55:08,010
Help us mortals to understand your will.

988
00:55:11,450 --> 00:55:12,283
- [Norma Jeane] Daddy.

989
00:55:12,283 --> 00:55:14,420
- [Bucky] Norma Jeane, I told
you, I gotta get my sleep,

990
00:55:14,420 --> 00:55:16,260
I have to report early in the morning.

991
00:55:16,260 --> 00:55:17,710
- Gimme a baby.

992
00:55:17,710 --> 00:55:18,620
I want a baby.

993
00:55:18,620 --> 00:55:20,700
- I'll be damned, Norma
Jeane, we went through this.

994
00:55:20,700 --> 00:55:22,800
World War II is no time to start a family.

995
00:55:23,671 --> 00:55:25,770
- [Norma Jeane] Don't
leave me Daddy, please,

996
00:55:25,770 --> 00:55:27,220
if you leave me I'll die.

997
00:55:27,220 --> 00:55:29,090
- [Bucky] Calm down, you're not gonna die.

998
00:55:31,915 --> 00:55:33,670
- [Norma Jeane] I want a baby.

999
00:55:33,670 --> 00:55:34,980
- Norma Jeane.

1000
00:55:34,980 --> 00:55:36,090
Norma Jeane, stop it.

1001
00:55:36,090 --> 00:55:38,230
Just stop it, you're smothering me.

1002
00:55:38,230 --> 00:55:39,063
- Oh Daddy.

1003
00:55:39,063 --> 00:55:41,738
- Look, cooking and
cleaning and making out

1004
00:55:41,738 --> 00:55:44,940
like I'm God or something,
I don't wanna be God.

1005
00:55:44,940 --> 00:55:47,110
Just get off of me, you sad sick cow!

1006
00:55:51,765 --> 00:55:53,848
(crying)

1007
00:55:56,540 --> 00:55:59,514
Norma Jeane, what the hell?

1008
00:55:59,514 --> 00:56:01,940
- No.

1009
00:56:01,940 --> 00:56:03,340
Oh Daddy.

1010
00:56:03,340 --> 00:56:05,271
You love me, don't you?

1011
00:56:05,271 --> 00:56:06,104
Don't you Daddy?
- Sure I do.

1012
00:56:06,104 --> 00:56:07,330
Sure I love you, baby, come on.

1013
00:56:07,330 --> 00:56:08,790
I married you, didn't I?

1014
00:56:08,790 --> 00:56:10,143
- I love you.

1015
00:56:10,143 --> 00:56:11,093
I love you so much.

1016
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,632
Don't leave me.

1017
00:56:13,632 --> 00:56:16,022
(crying)

1018
00:56:16,022 --> 00:56:18,605
(somber music)

1019
00:56:26,542 --> 00:56:28,980
- Goodbye Norma Jeane.

1020
00:56:28,980 --> 00:56:31,970
She was a sweet kid, but so emotional.

1021
00:56:31,970 --> 00:56:34,370
She was wanting love all the time.

1022
00:56:34,370 --> 00:56:36,460
She was immature and unreliable.

1023
00:56:38,070 --> 00:56:40,750
But I guess so was I.

1024
00:56:40,750 --> 00:56:41,650
We were too young.

1025
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:43,870
If she would've been a better cook

1026
00:56:43,870 --> 00:56:46,720
and not so emotional, it might've worked.

1027
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:49,150
- If he loved me, he
wouldn't have left me.

1028
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:51,810
If he left me, he didn't love me.

1029
00:56:52,957 --> 00:56:57,230
I was 18, no longer a ward of LA County,

1030
00:56:57,230 --> 00:57:00,490
for the first time in my life, I was free.

1031
00:57:02,190 --> 00:57:04,510
Not an orphan or a foster child,

1032
00:57:04,510 --> 00:57:06,910
not a daughter or a
daughter-in-law, not a wife.

1033
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,580
Because of the war, I was free.

1034
00:57:11,790 --> 00:57:13,763
My life would now begin.

1035
00:57:16,057 --> 00:57:21,057
I was nobody's daughter.

1036
00:57:22,370 --> 00:57:25,370
(upbeat jazz music)

1037
00:57:30,460 --> 00:57:31,920
- Norma Jeane.

1038
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:34,340
This stuff'll penetrate your brain.

1039
00:57:34,340 --> 00:57:35,910
Maybe you better get some fresh air.

1040
00:57:35,910 --> 00:57:37,200
- I don't get tired.

1041
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:41,597
I mean, I don't have time, I
wouldn't want to lose my job.

1042
00:57:41,597 --> 00:57:44,042
(laughing)

1043
00:57:44,042 --> 00:57:45,740
Sorry, I'm just a little dizzy.

1044
00:57:46,970 --> 00:57:48,060
Gosh. (laughs)

1045
00:57:48,060 --> 00:57:49,740
- I notice your wedding rings.

1046
00:57:50,650 --> 00:57:54,240
- Oh, yeah, my husband's
lost in action in New Guinea.

1047
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:55,460
- I'm sorry.

1048
00:57:55,460 --> 00:57:56,293
Must be lonely.

1049
00:57:57,340 --> 00:57:58,930
You live alone?

1050
00:57:58,930 --> 00:58:01,370
- Oh, a furnished room in
Burbank, but I love it.

1051
00:58:01,370 --> 00:58:03,470
Not so much housework for just one person.

1052
00:58:04,458 --> 00:58:06,680
- Maybe some night we could have dinner.

1053
00:58:08,270 --> 00:58:11,042
- Oh, well, I wouldn't feel right

1054
00:58:11,042 --> 00:58:14,589
until I know where my husband is.

1055
00:58:14,589 --> 00:58:16,672
(laughs)

1056
00:58:31,970 --> 00:58:33,015
- Hold it.

1057
00:58:33,015 --> 00:58:34,880
(camera clicks)

1058
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:36,050
Beautiful.

1059
00:58:36,050 --> 00:58:38,490
- Oh no, I can't, please, I can't.

1060
00:58:38,490 --> 00:58:40,890
- Come on, it's for the boys overseas,

1061
00:58:40,890 --> 00:58:42,490
the stars and stripes.

1062
00:58:42,490 --> 00:58:43,910
Don't want our boys to despair, do you?

1063
00:58:43,910 --> 00:58:45,710
That's tantamount to treason.

1064
00:58:45,710 --> 00:58:46,661
(laughs)

1065
00:58:46,661 --> 00:58:48,430
- Well, can't you use somebody else?

1066
00:58:48,430 --> 00:58:49,630
- Not since I found you.

1067
00:58:52,090 --> 00:58:54,866
Come over here.

1068
00:58:54,866 --> 00:58:59,866
Come on.

1069
00:59:01,610 --> 00:59:02,810
Yeah, stand there, baby.

1070
00:59:04,925 --> 00:59:06,200
Yeah, like that.

1071
00:59:07,090 --> 00:59:09,860
- Wait, I don't... (laughs)

1072
00:59:11,066 --> 00:59:12,351
- That's good.

1073
00:59:12,351 --> 00:59:14,160
That's what the boys want from me.

1074
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:14,993
T and A.

1075
00:59:16,140 --> 00:59:17,190
Baby, you've got 'em.

1076
00:59:18,039 --> 00:59:19,600
(camera clicks)

1077
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:21,430
This is just the beginning.

1078
00:59:21,430 --> 00:59:24,070
We're gonna make beautiful music together.

1079
00:59:24,070 --> 00:59:27,070
(upbeat jazz music)

1080
00:59:28,030 --> 00:59:30,834
(camera clicking)
(laughs)

1081
00:59:30,834 --> 00:59:32,734
She was my sweet little oaky cash cow.

1082
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:35,890
Sweet, but goofy.

1083
00:59:37,180 --> 00:59:39,330
Interested in all my books about Marxism

1084
00:59:39,330 --> 00:59:40,410
and the meaning of life.

1085
00:59:40,410 --> 00:59:42,510
She was trying to read Schopenhauer, even.

1086
00:59:43,610 --> 00:59:45,190
I plucked her out of oblivion.

1087
00:59:46,590 --> 00:59:49,250
A Van Ives hick with ambition.

1088
00:59:51,430 --> 00:59:54,180
(men chattering)

1089
01:00:03,575 --> 01:00:05,825
- Son of a, that's my wife.

1090
01:00:07,410 --> 01:00:09,100
Hey, this is my wife.

1091
01:00:11,320 --> 01:00:14,034
- How do we really know this is your wife?

1092
01:00:14,034 --> 01:00:17,867
(men whooping and chattering)

1093
01:00:21,746 --> 01:00:23,170
- She wasn't wearing a brassiere.

1094
01:00:23,170 --> 01:00:24,810
Probably no underpants either.

1095
01:00:24,810 --> 01:00:26,920
Showing everything she had like a whore.

1096
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:29,690
Sure I was damned angry, I still am.

1097
01:00:29,690 --> 01:00:31,690
Shamed my family's name.

1098
01:00:31,690 --> 01:00:33,960
No Glazer's ever been divorced.

1099
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:35,610
No Glazers' wives ever ran off.

1100
01:00:37,844 --> 01:00:40,470
(goat bleats)

1101
01:00:40,470 --> 01:00:42,750
- Otto, you like me, don't you?

1102
01:00:42,750 --> 01:00:46,790
I mean like a girlfriend, or?

1103
01:00:48,064 --> 01:00:49,990
- I don't wanna hurt you, Norma Jeane.

1104
01:00:51,735 --> 01:00:53,857
Come on, don't play dumber than you are.

1105
01:00:56,226 --> 01:00:58,630
That look, what you just did.

1106
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:02,365
Gotta learn about lighting.

1107
01:01:02,365 --> 01:01:03,710
You're not always gonna have me around.

1108
01:01:05,503 --> 01:01:10,503
(camera clicking)
(light jazz music)

1109
01:01:17,486 --> 01:01:18,720
- Don't make me into a joke, Otto.

1110
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:20,394
- You're already a joke.

1111
01:01:20,394 --> 01:01:21,694
The female body is a joke.

1112
01:01:24,150 --> 01:01:26,697
All this fecundity, this beauty.

1113
01:01:28,490 --> 01:01:31,490
The aim is to drive men wild to copulate

1114
01:01:31,490 --> 01:01:34,320
and reproduce the species,
and what's the species?

1115
01:01:34,320 --> 01:01:37,460
99% of humankind doesn't deserve to live.

1116
01:01:49,720 --> 01:01:51,080
Take it off.

1117
01:01:51,080 --> 01:01:51,913
Nobody's here.

1118
01:01:52,854 --> 01:01:54,445
- Are you crazy?

1119
01:01:54,445 --> 01:01:55,278
Never.

1120
01:01:55,278 --> 01:01:56,690
- You holding out for a film career?

1121
01:01:58,130 --> 01:02:01,260
Sooner or later, baby,
you'll come back to me.

1122
01:02:02,300 --> 01:02:03,133
- Maybe so.

1123
01:02:04,510 --> 01:02:05,910
But not in my birthday suit.

1124
01:02:08,248 --> 01:02:10,915
(camera clicks)

1125
01:02:13,930 --> 01:02:14,763
- Hi!

1126
01:02:14,763 --> 01:02:15,940
How are ya?

1127
01:02:15,940 --> 01:02:18,940
(people chattering)

1128
01:02:22,470 --> 01:02:23,303
- There he is.

1129
01:02:24,155 --> 01:02:25,880
- He looks like Rumpelstiltskin.

1130
01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:28,880
- Isaac.

1131
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:33,240
This is Norma Jeane Baker,
Mr. IE Shinn, your new agent.

1132
01:02:33,240 --> 01:02:35,634
- I appreciate this.

1133
01:02:35,634 --> 01:02:36,890
- Sit, sit.

1134
01:02:45,550 --> 01:02:49,060
Get rid of the curls, your
hair should be lighter,

1135
01:02:49,060 --> 01:02:50,610
and your eyebrows are too thin.

1136
01:02:51,540 --> 01:02:54,230
And you have to learn how to walk,

1137
01:02:54,230 --> 01:02:57,654
how to carry yourself, how to breathe.

1138
01:02:57,654 --> 01:02:58,520
(laughs)

1139
01:02:58,520 --> 01:03:00,970
- Well maybe I should go
back to spraying airplanes.

1140
01:03:00,970 --> 01:03:03,220
(laughing)

1141
01:03:03,220 --> 01:03:08,220
- No, you're gonna have
a career, I guarantee it.

1142
01:03:08,430 --> 01:03:12,750
Now, every decade, there has
to be a glamour girl, a star,

1143
01:03:12,750 --> 01:03:15,690
I think that would be the
role for you, my dear.

1144
01:03:15,690 --> 01:03:19,560
- Oh, Mr. Shinn, that isn't who I am.

1145
01:03:19,560 --> 01:03:21,550
- You just do what I say
and I'm gonna get you

1146
01:03:21,550 --> 01:03:23,430
the contract with the studio.

1147
01:03:23,430 --> 01:03:24,758
- Studio?

1148
01:03:24,758 --> 01:03:26,560
My mother worked for the studio,

1149
01:03:26,560 --> 01:03:29,230
she was responsible for
some wonderful films.

1150
01:03:29,230 --> 01:03:30,063
- Really?

1151
01:03:30,063 --> 01:03:31,360
Where's your mother now, dear?

1152
01:03:32,760 --> 01:03:34,270
- Oh, she died.

1153
01:03:35,329 --> 01:03:37,412
(laughs)

1154
01:03:39,012 --> 01:03:41,512
(crow cawing)

1155
01:03:50,274 --> 01:03:51,107
Mother?

1156
01:03:57,513 --> 01:03:58,346
Oh Mother.

1157
01:03:59,650 --> 01:04:01,284
Mother.

1158
01:04:01,284 --> 01:04:03,770
I didn't know what to do, I didn't know

1159
01:04:03,770 --> 01:04:06,770
if you wanted to see me, you
never answered my letters.

1160
01:04:09,009 --> 01:04:10,480
It's been so long.

1161
01:04:12,133 --> 01:04:13,000
I'm sorry I haven't...

1162
01:04:15,590 --> 01:04:17,990
I don't know where to
begin, I've been modeling.

1163
01:04:18,950 --> 01:04:21,215
I brought you some of
my pictures to show you.

1164
01:04:21,215 --> 01:04:24,790
This one is me as Miss
Aluminum Products 1945.

1165
01:04:24,790 --> 01:04:29,593
And this is me as Miss Paper
Products, I like this one.

1166
01:04:31,140 --> 01:04:36,140
And here's me as Miss
California Dairy. (laughs)

1167
01:04:36,629 --> 01:04:39,940
It's kinda, but this one
was in Good Housekeeping.

1168
01:04:41,260 --> 01:04:44,830
Oh Mother, this past year,
it's been so exciting,

1169
01:04:44,830 --> 01:04:46,600
I've been modeling, I'm under contract

1170
01:04:46,600 --> 01:04:48,450
at the studio where you used to work.

1171
01:04:49,549 --> 01:04:51,460
It's just been so exciting.

1172
01:04:53,551 --> 01:04:54,384
And wonderful.

1173
01:04:54,384 --> 01:04:55,730
- I don't know you, who are you?

1174
01:04:57,500 --> 01:05:00,083
(somber music)

1175
01:05:05,470 --> 01:05:07,060
- Hold it, I love it.

1176
01:05:07,060 --> 01:05:08,842
- No, Otto, not now.

1177
01:05:08,842 --> 01:05:10,040
- Come on, I was born for this,

1178
01:05:10,040 --> 01:05:11,820
breasts jiggling, tears running.

1179
01:05:11,820 --> 01:05:12,780
- Do you hear me, Otto?

1180
01:05:12,780 --> 01:05:15,565
I said stop, I said stop.

1181
01:05:15,565 --> 01:05:17,640
(camera clicking)

1182
01:05:17,640 --> 01:05:19,340
I'm leaving all this behind, Otto.

1183
01:05:20,366 --> 01:05:22,090
I'm going to invent myself.

1184
01:05:22,090 --> 01:05:22,923
A new self.

1185
01:05:25,296 --> 01:05:29,170
And I'm never gonna look back again.

1186
01:05:32,034 --> 01:05:35,034
(upbeat jazz music)

1187
01:05:37,412 --> 01:05:39,008
- [Man] All right, let's go.

1188
01:05:39,008 --> 01:05:40,937
Come on, bring it.

1189
01:05:40,937 --> 01:05:45,937
I got it.

1190
01:05:47,632 --> 01:05:49,965
(whistling)

1191
01:06:01,963 --> 01:06:03,062
(typewriter clacking)

1192
01:06:03,062 --> 01:06:03,976
(typewriter dings)

1193
01:06:03,976 --> 01:06:04,809
- Hello.

1194
01:06:04,809 --> 01:06:06,010
I'm Norma Jeane Baker,
I have an appointment

1195
01:06:06,010 --> 01:06:07,370
to see Mr. R.

1196
01:06:07,370 --> 01:06:09,460
- What was the name again?

1197
01:06:09,460 --> 01:06:10,460
- Norma Jeane Baker?

1198
01:06:11,697 --> 01:06:16,390
I have an appointment, to see
Mr. R, before my audition.

1199
01:06:16,390 --> 01:06:19,263
- [Mr. R] Come inside and close the door.

1200
01:06:33,788 --> 01:06:37,170
- Oh! (laughs)

1201
01:06:37,170 --> 01:06:40,100
- You think this is a Marx brothers movie?

1202
01:06:40,100 --> 01:06:40,933
- No, I...

1203
01:06:46,972 --> 01:06:48,722
- You like my aviary.

1204
01:06:49,750 --> 01:06:51,667
- Oh, they're all dead.

1205
01:06:56,018 --> 01:06:58,768
(birds chirping)

1206
01:07:05,150 --> 01:07:08,330
- Taxidermy is the most
restful of my hobbies.

1207
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:14,111
Someday I might show you my
laboratory, in the desert.

1208
01:07:14,111 --> 01:07:15,220
(laughs)

1209
01:07:15,220 --> 01:07:17,870
- Well, I'm just glad there
aren't any hummingbirds,

1210
01:07:17,870 --> 01:07:22,560
I mean, they're so
helpless and tiny. (laughs)

1211
01:07:23,945 --> 01:07:25,450
- Come on.

1212
01:07:25,450 --> 01:07:27,300
Let's drop the goo goo routine.

1213
01:07:28,442 --> 01:07:31,450
You can't be as dumb as you look.

1214
01:07:35,680 --> 01:07:36,680
Get down, blondie.

1215
01:07:40,656 --> 01:07:44,690
Good girl.

1216
01:07:52,960 --> 01:07:55,240
- I take it your interview
with Mr. R is over?

1217
01:07:56,474 --> 01:07:57,307
- Yes.

1218
01:08:00,119 --> 01:08:02,060
You wouldn't happen to have an aspirin

1219
01:08:02,060 --> 01:08:04,522
or anything, would you?

1220
01:08:04,522 --> 01:08:06,770
- I have some codine.

1221
01:08:07,950 --> 01:08:08,783
One or two?

1222
01:08:10,331 --> 01:08:11,164
- Two.

1223
01:08:12,248 --> 01:08:14,000
Thank you.

1224
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,460
I don't usually take painkillers,

1225
01:08:16,460 --> 01:08:19,920
but I just got my period
and I have to audition, so.

1226
01:08:21,370 --> 01:08:23,020
- You might need these for later.

1227
01:08:25,383 --> 01:08:26,383
- Thank you.

1228
01:08:30,038 --> 01:08:30,871
I wonder.

1229
01:08:31,947 --> 01:08:34,646
(laughs)

1230
01:08:34,646 --> 01:08:35,853
I wouldn't happen to
have a stain on my skirt

1231
01:08:39,251 --> 01:08:41,759
or anything, would I?

1232
01:08:41,759 --> 01:08:42,898
- No.

1233
01:08:42,898 --> 01:08:47,898
I don't see any stain.

1234
01:08:59,034 --> 01:09:00,480
- Hello.

1235
01:09:00,480 --> 01:09:03,370
I'm here to read for
Scudda Hoo, Scudda Hay.

1236
01:09:03,370 --> 01:09:04,670
June Haver's girlfriend.

1237
01:09:04,670 --> 01:09:05,970
It's just a few lines.

1238
01:09:05,970 --> 01:09:07,640
- You won't have to audition.

1239
01:09:07,640 --> 01:09:10,450
- Well, I know I'm late, but I mean,

1240
01:09:10,450 --> 01:09:12,600
it's only 20 minutes, and I had a meeting.

1241
01:09:12,600 --> 01:09:13,600
- You have the part.

1242
01:09:15,550 --> 01:09:18,850
- You mean I'm cast?

1243
01:09:18,850 --> 01:09:21,243
- If your name is Norma Jeane Baker?

1244
01:09:21,243 --> 01:09:22,160
(laughs)

1245
01:09:22,160 --> 01:09:24,160
- Yes, but I don't...

1246
01:09:26,170 --> 01:09:27,003
- You're in.

1247
01:09:28,740 --> 01:09:30,445
Here's a script, and you'll report here

1248
01:09:30,445 --> 01:09:32,140
at seven a.m. tomorrow.

1249
01:09:35,100 --> 01:09:40,100
- You mean I'm in the
movie, I'm cast, I'm in.

1250
01:09:40,280 --> 01:09:41,870
- Mr. R was impressed.

1251
01:09:43,150 --> 01:09:45,550
And your agent is waiting
for you in his office.

1252
01:09:46,839 --> 01:09:48,680
(laughs)

1253
01:09:48,680 --> 01:09:49,830
- Thank you, thank you.

1254
01:09:58,400 --> 01:09:59,920
- Norma Jeane is a hick name.

1255
01:10:00,940 --> 01:10:01,990
It's an oaky name.

1256
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:04,500
It has no glamour or allure.

1257
01:10:05,650 --> 01:10:07,100
- Well, actually, I--

1258
01:10:07,100 --> 01:10:09,570
- My assistant put some
names together here.

1259
01:10:11,050 --> 01:10:15,010
Myra, Mona, Mina, Marilyn, Mavis.

1260
01:10:15,010 --> 01:10:17,650
I want the Mmm mmm sound.

1261
01:10:17,650 --> 01:10:19,500
Last name will be Miller.

1262
01:10:19,500 --> 01:10:23,320
- Well, I'd like to retain Norma at least,

1263
01:10:23,320 --> 01:10:25,730
I mean, that is my real name, so.

1264
01:10:25,730 --> 01:10:29,370
- Mira Miller, Mina
Miller, Marilyn Miller.

1265
01:10:29,370 --> 01:10:31,320
- Already a Marilyn Miller on Broadway.

1266
01:10:32,513 --> 01:10:33,346
(spits)

1267
01:10:33,346 --> 01:10:34,179
- Damn.

1268
01:10:34,179 --> 01:10:35,012
- Norma Miller?

1269
01:10:36,100 --> 01:10:40,554
My grandmother's last name was Monroe.

1270
01:10:40,554 --> 01:10:41,660
- Marilyn.

1271
01:10:41,660 --> 01:10:42,510
- Marilyn Monroe!

1272
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:44,934
It's sexy!

1273
01:10:44,934 --> 01:10:46,642
(laughing)

1274
01:10:46,642 --> 01:10:47,640
- That's your new name.

1275
01:10:47,640 --> 01:10:49,974
- Well, now you're a true starlet.

1276
01:10:49,974 --> 01:10:52,224
(laughing)

1277
01:10:55,430 --> 01:10:57,230
- Congratulations.

1278
01:10:57,230 --> 01:10:58,063
- Thank you.

1279
01:10:59,413 --> 01:11:01,996
(somber music)

1280
01:11:08,521 --> 01:11:09,938
- Marilyn Monroe.

1281
01:11:11,198 --> 01:11:12,031
My name.

1282
01:11:13,675 --> 01:11:16,572
My name is Marilyn Monroe.

1283
01:11:16,572 --> 01:11:19,297
I couldn't be sold any other way, I guess.

1284
01:11:20,660 --> 01:11:22,210
And I saw that I must be sold.

1285
01:11:23,870 --> 01:11:25,270
For then I would be desired.

1286
01:11:27,622 --> 01:11:28,830
Then I would be loved.

1287
01:11:36,290 --> 01:11:37,123
- So.

1288
01:11:38,480 --> 01:11:39,630
The studio dropped you.

1289
01:11:40,550 --> 01:11:41,870
- My scene.

1290
01:11:41,870 --> 01:11:45,500
They edited my scene down to second, so.

1291
01:11:45,500 --> 01:11:46,610
- I knew you'd be back.

1292
01:11:47,721 --> 01:11:48,554
Here you go.

1293
01:11:49,500 --> 01:11:50,600
Standard release form.

1294
01:11:57,447 --> 01:11:58,880
- How much?

1295
01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:01,936
- 50 bucks.

1296
01:12:01,936 --> 01:12:03,818
- Only 50?

1297
01:12:03,818 --> 01:12:06,810
- The only offer we've got is
from Ace Hollywood Calendars.

1298
01:12:08,300 --> 01:12:10,775
Take it or leave it.

1299
01:12:10,775 --> 01:12:13,358
(somber music)

1300
01:12:21,070 --> 01:12:23,190
Shinn's supposed to be working for you.

1301
01:12:23,190 --> 01:12:24,130
He's your agent.

1302
01:12:25,110 --> 01:12:25,960
What does he say?

1303
01:12:27,260 --> 01:12:29,450
- Well he's hoping to get
me cast in a serious role,

1304
01:12:29,450 --> 01:12:32,300
like Olivia De Havilland in Snake Pit,

1305
01:12:32,300 --> 01:12:36,660
but until then, my car got
repossessed this morning.

1306
01:12:37,859 --> 01:12:41,690
- I'm using the crushed
velvet for a candy box effect.

1307
01:12:41,690 --> 01:12:42,890
You're a piece of candy.

1308
01:12:44,050 --> 01:12:45,294
- Otto.

1309
01:12:45,294 --> 01:12:46,340
Can I use the bathroom?

1310
01:12:47,720 --> 01:12:48,990
- No, the toilet's broken.

1311
01:12:48,990 --> 01:12:51,270
- Well, I just want to wash my--

1312
01:12:51,270 --> 01:12:52,210
- No.

1313
01:12:52,210 --> 01:12:55,522
Now let's get started, Miss Golden Dreams.

1314
01:12:55,522 --> 01:12:56,650
(laughs)

1315
01:12:56,650 --> 01:12:58,340
- Wait, is that what I'm supposed to be?

1316
01:13:01,540 --> 01:13:04,178
- Shoes, you're wearing shoes?

1317
01:13:04,178 --> 01:13:05,130
- Oh.

1318
01:13:05,130 --> 01:13:06,590
Because the floor's dirty.

1319
01:13:06,590 --> 01:13:08,154
- Don't be stupid.

1320
01:13:08,154 --> 01:13:10,410
You ever see a nude in shoes?

1321
01:13:10,410 --> 01:13:11,860
Come on baby, everything off.

1322
01:13:13,310 --> 01:13:15,830
- Otto, can you promise
me not to photograph

1323
01:13:15,830 --> 01:13:19,210
the bottoms, I mean, the soles of my feet?

1324
01:13:19,210 --> 01:13:21,100
Promise me, okay, please.

1325
01:13:21,100 --> 01:13:23,950
- I'm trying to concentrate,
you're getting on my nerves.

1326
01:13:26,574 --> 01:13:31,220
- It's just, I've never
posed naked before.

1327
01:13:34,120 --> 01:13:37,020
- Not naked, sweetheart, nude.

1328
01:13:38,140 --> 01:13:39,960
Not smut, art.

1329
01:13:41,300 --> 01:13:42,800
There's a crucial distinction.

1330
01:13:43,939 --> 01:13:47,770
- Like photographer not
pornographer. (laughs)

1331
01:13:49,639 --> 01:13:51,539
Otto, don't make me into a joke, okay?

1332
01:13:52,720 --> 01:13:53,553
Please.

1333
01:13:53,553 --> 01:13:54,870
- I believe that she could see herself

1334
01:13:54,870 --> 01:13:56,037
through the camera eye.

1335
01:13:56,978 --> 01:13:59,860
It was more powerful, more totally sexual

1336
01:13:59,860 --> 01:14:01,320
than any human connection.

1337
01:14:03,152 --> 01:14:05,550
Her problem wasn't that
she was a dumb blonde,

1338
01:14:06,420 --> 01:14:09,670
it's that she wasn't a
blonde and she wasn't dumb.

1339
01:14:12,069 --> 01:14:12,969
- I'm still there.

1340
01:14:15,140 --> 01:14:16,490
- Norma Jeane, sweetheart.

1341
01:14:17,530 --> 01:14:19,560
I want you to meet a friend of mine.

1342
01:14:19,560 --> 01:14:21,700
Old comrade from the trenches,

1343
01:14:21,700 --> 01:14:24,140
Cass Chaplin, son of Charlie.

1344
01:14:25,450 --> 01:14:26,283
- Hello Norma.

1345
01:14:28,319 --> 01:14:29,990
- I know your eyes.

1346
01:14:31,590 --> 01:14:33,390
My mother had a City Lights poster

1347
01:14:33,390 --> 01:14:35,590
of Charlie Chaplin when
I was a little girl.

1348
01:14:37,560 --> 01:14:39,758
- We know each other, Norma.

1349
01:14:39,758 --> 01:14:42,078
We've always known each other.

1350
01:14:42,078 --> 01:14:43,390
You have to be a Gemini.

1351
01:14:44,580 --> 01:14:46,220
- June 1st, 1926.

1352
01:14:47,110 --> 01:14:47,943
- I know.

1353
01:14:49,465 --> 01:14:53,214
We're twins.

1354
01:14:53,214 --> 01:14:54,420
(laughs)

1355
01:14:54,420 --> 01:14:58,000
I saw in her not the tramp, the slut,

1356
01:14:58,000 --> 01:14:59,780
the joke who was Marilyn Monroe,

1357
01:15:01,080 --> 01:15:03,990
but the eager, hopeful young
girl who was Norma Jeane.

1358
01:15:05,570 --> 01:15:06,920
Why did we love each other?

1359
01:15:09,390 --> 01:15:11,740
Maybe because both our
fathers had disowned us.

1360
01:15:12,730 --> 01:15:13,563
The bastards.

1361
01:15:15,130 --> 01:15:20,130
I'd love her like a brother,
as a twin, with my soul.

1362
01:15:25,630 --> 01:15:28,630
(people chattering)

1363
01:15:38,954 --> 01:15:39,870
- Hi, hi.

1364
01:15:41,140 --> 01:15:42,040
This is Marilyn.

1365
01:15:42,040 --> 01:15:43,940
- Monroe, Marilyn Monroe.

1366
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:48,050
- I've read Asphalt
Jungle, the entire script.

1367
01:15:48,050 --> 01:15:49,940
It's a strange and disturbing story,

1368
01:15:50,824 --> 01:15:55,824
like a novel by Dostoevsky,
where you feel sympathy

1369
01:15:56,538 --> 01:15:59,338
for the killers and you don't
want to see them punished.

1370
01:16:00,280 --> 01:16:02,710
- So you've read
Dostoevsky, have you honey?

1371
01:16:03,867 --> 01:16:05,970
Well, let's see what you can do.

1372
01:16:06,930 --> 01:16:09,560
After all, you're the
first one to have read

1373
01:16:09,560 --> 01:16:10,480
the whole script.

1374
01:16:11,574 --> 01:16:13,991
(man laughs)

1375
01:16:23,570 --> 01:16:25,540
- When you first see Angela, she's asleep,

1376
01:16:25,540 --> 01:16:27,290
so that's how I've been rehearsing.

1377
01:16:46,134 --> 01:16:47,730
Oh.

1378
01:16:47,730 --> 01:16:48,930
I must have been asleep.

1379
01:16:50,680 --> 01:16:53,820
What's the big idea standing
there staring at me, Uncle Lon?

1380
01:16:55,270 --> 01:16:57,158
- [Man] Don't call me Uncle Lon.

1381
01:16:57,158 --> 01:16:57,991
- [Marilyn] I thought you liked it.

1382
01:16:59,470 --> 01:17:01,520
- [Man] Maybe I did, but I don't anymore.

1383
01:17:03,640 --> 01:17:06,610
- I had the market send over
some smoked mackerel for you.

1384
01:17:07,560 --> 01:17:09,410
I know how you love it for breakfast.

1385
01:17:10,340 --> 01:17:11,978
- Some sweet kid.

1386
01:17:11,978 --> 01:17:14,667
It's late, why don't you go to bed.

1387
01:17:29,060 --> 01:17:30,310
- Thank you, Miss Monroe.

1388
01:17:31,420 --> 01:17:32,253
Very good.

1389
01:17:40,933 --> 01:17:42,320
- It was pretty bad, wasn't it?

1390
01:17:42,320 --> 01:17:43,870
Sexy blonde, nice looking girl.

1391
01:17:44,900 --> 01:17:45,750
Like Lana Turner.

1392
01:17:47,050 --> 01:17:47,910
But too intense.

1393
01:17:49,070 --> 01:17:49,903
Can't act.

1394
01:17:51,430 --> 01:17:52,340
- Sweet Mary.

1395
01:17:53,220 --> 01:17:55,620
Will you look at the
ass on that little girl.

1396
01:17:59,498 --> 01:18:01,810
- Do you hear it?

1397
01:18:01,810 --> 01:18:03,130
Cass, wake up, there are voices again.

1398
01:18:03,130 --> 01:18:04,880
- Oh, it's all in your head, Norma,

1399
01:18:05,890 --> 01:18:07,510
you're exhausted, you need sleep.

1400
01:18:07,510 --> 01:18:08,400
- I can't sleep!

1401
01:18:09,490 --> 01:18:11,390
The director hates me,
he said I got the part

1402
01:18:11,390 --> 01:18:12,350
by walking away.

1403
01:18:12,350 --> 01:18:14,050
I'm not an idiot, I know what that means.

1404
01:18:14,050 --> 01:18:16,750
- Norma, let the bastard
lead you through your scenes.

1405
01:18:17,737 --> 01:18:19,180
That's what films are.

1406
01:18:19,180 --> 01:18:20,790
Not real acting, not theater.

1407
01:18:21,820 --> 01:18:22,700
Why work so hard?

1408
01:18:23,880 --> 01:18:25,580
God, you're sweating like a horse.

1409
01:18:28,150 --> 01:18:29,500
Why does this mean so much?

1410
01:18:31,200 --> 01:18:33,410
- 'Cause I don't wanna die.

1411
01:18:33,410 --> 01:18:34,390
- What?

1412
01:18:34,390 --> 01:18:38,390
- If I fail, if they
fire me, I'd wanna die.

1413
01:18:38,390 --> 01:18:40,370
- You're not gonna die.

1414
01:18:40,370 --> 01:18:41,620
You work too hard to die.

1415
01:18:43,947 --> 01:18:45,947
(sighs)

1416
01:18:46,831 --> 01:18:50,392
- If only we could live in a
little stucco house in Venice.

1417
01:18:50,392 --> 01:18:51,862
(laughs)

1418
01:18:51,862 --> 01:18:54,420
- Remember, I like to keep
my clothes in a suitcase.

1419
01:18:55,280 --> 01:18:57,488
- I know, but this'd be different
because we'd have a baby,

1420
01:18:57,488 --> 01:19:01,200
and he'd have dark hair and
beautiful eyes, a prince baby.

1421
01:19:02,041 --> 01:19:04,210
Charlie Chaplin's grandson.

1422
01:19:05,120 --> 01:19:06,570
What would Grandma Della say?

1423
01:19:07,421 --> 01:19:09,687
She loved the Little Tramp.

1424
01:19:09,687 --> 01:19:12,967
- The Tramp despised
children, especially his own.

1425
01:19:12,967 --> 01:19:15,317
You're lucky, Norma, you
never met your father.

1426
01:19:17,833 --> 01:19:19,650
- I'd like to know who he is.

1427
01:19:21,030 --> 01:19:24,423
Shake his hand, say hello, goodbye.

1428
01:19:28,176 --> 01:19:29,009
(groans)

1429
01:19:29,009 --> 01:19:29,870
Can't sleep, Cass.

1430
01:19:31,592 --> 01:19:32,425
(sighs)

1431
01:19:32,425 --> 01:19:34,260
I'm gonna ruin everything,
they're gonna replace me.

1432
01:19:35,162 --> 01:19:37,870
(pills rattling)

1433
01:19:37,870 --> 01:19:39,220
- A little potion, darling.

1434
01:19:40,592 --> 01:19:42,342
To help you, to help us both sleep.

1435
01:19:43,852 --> 01:19:44,685
- What is it?

1436
01:19:44,685 --> 01:19:45,690
- A little magic.

1437
01:19:45,690 --> 01:19:47,960
Sleep is the sweetest state.

1438
01:19:47,960 --> 01:19:51,650
You're dead, yet alive, exquisite!

1439
01:19:51,650 --> 01:19:53,640
- I don't believe in barbiturates.

1440
01:19:53,640 --> 01:19:55,610
I believe the mind can control everything.

1441
01:19:55,610 --> 01:19:57,320
- Well try it, you'll see
what happens tomorrow.

1442
01:19:57,320 --> 01:19:58,510
- No.

1443
01:19:58,510 --> 01:19:59,540
- Open your mouth.

1444
01:20:00,680 --> 01:20:03,952
You'll sleep like a baby, I promise.

1445
01:20:03,952 --> 01:20:06,535
(gentle music)

1446
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:12,520
- [Man] Roll camera.

1447
01:20:19,583 --> 01:20:21,630
- I had the market send some
smoked mackerel for you.

1448
01:20:21,630 --> 01:20:23,770
I know how you love it for breakfast.

1449
01:20:25,220 --> 01:20:26,370
- [Man] Some sweet kid.

1450
01:20:29,621 --> 01:20:31,710
- She was fascinating to watch.

1451
01:20:32,590 --> 01:20:34,160
Like a mental patient, almost.

1452
01:20:35,180 --> 01:20:36,650
Not acting, no technique.

1453
01:20:37,952 --> 01:20:39,752
It was all there from the beginning.

1454
01:20:41,584 --> 01:20:44,270
Her genius, you could say.

1455
01:20:46,356 --> 01:20:47,370
Her madness.

1456
01:20:49,170 --> 01:20:51,570
- White suits you, dear, it really does.

1457
01:20:51,570 --> 01:20:53,360
White suits you so well.

1458
01:20:54,360 --> 01:20:56,824
You'll wear that one to the screening.

1459
01:20:56,824 --> 01:21:01,824
And we have some suits
over here, and some shoes.

1460
01:21:02,400 --> 01:21:03,233
(laughs)

1461
01:21:03,233 --> 01:21:06,510
- Mr. Shinn, it's all too much.

1462
01:21:06,510 --> 01:21:08,950
- Well, it's an investment
in Marilyn Monroe.

1463
01:21:10,387 --> 01:21:13,030
You know, when The Asphalt
Jungle is released,

1464
01:21:13,030 --> 01:21:15,240
Miss Monroe is gonna
be a very hot property.

1465
01:21:16,150 --> 01:21:17,790
I have faith, even if you don't.

1466
01:21:19,136 --> 01:21:21,440
- Oh, I do, but, I do have faith,

1467
01:21:21,440 --> 01:21:23,780
enough to move mountains, it's just that,

1468
01:21:23,780 --> 01:21:27,860
well, Otto said I'm photogenic,
but it's just a trick.

1469
01:21:27,860 --> 01:21:29,561
- Stay away from Otto.

1470
01:21:29,561 --> 01:21:31,440
Pornographer.

1471
01:21:31,440 --> 01:21:33,890
I hope you've put him behind you.

1472
01:21:34,740 --> 01:21:36,990
- Oh yes I have.

1473
01:21:36,990 --> 01:21:40,130
- Otto, Cass Chaplin, you should stay away

1474
01:21:40,130 --> 01:21:41,230
from people like that.

1475
01:21:43,230 --> 01:21:48,230
- But I love Cass, I hope
he'll marry me someday soon.

1476
01:21:50,610 --> 01:21:52,670
- Do you know he's a drunk?

1477
01:21:52,670 --> 01:21:54,590
He's a loser, a jinx.

1478
01:21:54,590 --> 01:21:55,520
- Mr. Shinn.

1479
01:21:55,520 --> 01:21:58,400
- He owes money all over town.

1480
01:21:58,400 --> 01:22:00,030
He leeches onto women.

1481
01:22:00,870 --> 01:22:03,030
I don't want you to be
seen in public with him.

1482
01:22:04,070 --> 01:22:07,750
- Well then I won't be
needing the dress, Mr. Shinn,

1483
01:22:07,750 --> 01:22:09,390
because I won't be going to the premiere.

1484
01:22:09,390 --> 01:22:11,070
- Oh yes you will!

1485
01:22:11,070 --> 01:22:14,390
The studio expects Marilyn,
and Marilyn is gonna be there.

1486
01:22:14,390 --> 01:22:18,720
You signed a contract to
fulfill publicity requirements.

1487
01:22:18,720 --> 01:22:23,710
You see, I invented you,
and I understand you,

1488
01:22:23,710 --> 01:22:26,360
and I'm the one who has your
best interests at heart.

1489
01:22:27,220 --> 01:22:28,972
- You didn't invent me.

1490
01:22:28,972 --> 01:22:30,772
I invented myself.

1491
01:22:30,772 --> 01:22:33,200
- Oh, don't get metaphysical on me.

1492
01:22:34,060 --> 01:22:38,510
Marilyn is a knockout,
and Marilyn has talent.

1493
01:22:38,510 --> 01:22:42,660
She just has to be, she doesn't
need to understand or think.

1494
01:22:42,660 --> 01:22:43,580
Trust me on that.

1495
01:22:44,450 --> 01:22:46,880
Pick you up for the
screening, seven sharp.

1496
01:22:47,750 --> 01:22:50,700
You're gonna look dynamite in that dress.

1497
01:22:53,216 --> 01:22:58,216
- Thank you, Daddy.

1498
01:23:00,156 --> 01:23:05,156
(upbeat jazz music)
(people chattering)

1499
01:23:22,606 --> 01:23:25,880
- Marilyn, you look fantastic.

1500
01:23:25,880 --> 01:23:27,030
- Look, there's someone
I'd like you to meet.

1501
01:23:27,030 --> 01:23:28,350
- I need to find Cass.

1502
01:23:28,350 --> 01:23:29,183
- Clark Gable.

1503
01:23:30,190 --> 01:23:33,850
- Ms. Monroe, you were radiant.

1504
01:23:35,010 --> 01:23:35,860
- Oh my goodness.

1505
01:23:37,114 --> 01:23:39,220
I've dreamed of--

1506
01:23:39,220 --> 01:23:40,700
- Don't be shy, dear.

1507
01:23:40,700 --> 01:23:43,180
- My Gable, when I was a little girl,

1508
01:23:43,180 --> 01:23:47,200
my mother had a photo of a
man, he looked just like you.

1509
01:23:47,200 --> 01:23:50,210
I think maybe we're related?

1510
01:23:51,215 --> 01:23:52,060
- I don't--

1511
01:23:52,060 --> 01:23:54,840
- Gladys Mortenson, she
worked at the studio,

1512
01:23:54,840 --> 01:23:56,370
developing film, you must remember.

1513
01:23:56,370 --> 01:24:00,080
- I'm sorry, I don't
think I know your mother.

1514
01:24:00,080 --> 01:24:01,250
Excuse me.

1515
01:24:01,250 --> 01:24:02,083
- But...

1516
01:24:04,984 --> 01:24:05,817
- What was that?

1517
01:24:06,924 --> 01:24:11,924
- He looked like a photo of my father.

1518
01:24:15,120 --> 01:24:16,460
Where's Cass, I need to find Cass,

1519
01:24:16,460 --> 01:24:18,709
he promised me he'd be here, I wonder

1520
01:24:18,709 --> 01:24:20,209
if something's happened to him.

1521
01:24:20,209 --> 01:24:23,180
- Marilyn, this isn't the time
to be thinking about Cass.

1522
01:24:23,180 --> 01:24:25,140
This is your time.

1523
01:24:25,140 --> 01:24:26,330
This is a victory.

1524
01:24:27,300 --> 01:24:28,920
You've shown them all.

1525
01:24:29,830 --> 01:24:32,853
You heard what he said,
didn't you, Clark Gable?

1526
01:24:32,853 --> 01:24:34,740
He said you were radiant.

1527
01:24:34,740 --> 01:24:37,010
So, be radiant.

1528
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:41,170
The studio's gonna take you back.

1529
01:24:42,288 --> 01:24:47,288
I'm gonna get you $500 a
week this time. (chuckles)

1530
01:24:47,690 --> 01:24:50,270
And this is just the beginning, dear.

1531
01:24:50,270 --> 01:24:51,870
Just the beginning.

1532
01:24:51,870 --> 01:24:52,710
Hey, Freddy.

1533
01:24:54,150 --> 01:24:55,190
Come over here.

1534
01:24:55,190 --> 01:24:57,790
I want you to meet Marilyn Monroe.

1535
01:25:02,372 --> 01:25:06,752
- Hi.

1536
01:25:06,752 --> 01:25:09,502
(tinkling music)

1537
01:25:36,614 --> 01:25:39,614
(upbeat jazz music)

1538
01:25:41,650 --> 01:25:43,758
- Could you wait for me a minute?

1539
01:25:43,758 --> 01:25:45,722
I'm not sure if anybody's home.

1540
01:25:45,722 --> 01:25:50,722
Thank you.

1541
01:25:59,100 --> 01:26:01,030
(knocking)

1542
01:26:01,030 --> 01:26:03,965
Cass?

1543
01:26:03,965 --> 01:26:07,971
Cass?

1544
01:26:07,971 --> 01:26:10,888
(insects chirping)

1545
01:26:24,666 --> 01:26:28,626
Cass?

1546
01:26:28,626 --> 01:26:31,696
Cass?

1547
01:26:31,696 --> 01:26:32,936
Baby?

1548
01:26:32,936 --> 01:26:35,186
(laughing)

1549
01:26:36,700 --> 01:26:38,060
- Norma, darling.

1550
01:26:41,559 --> 01:26:43,510
Wait, don't run away.

1551
01:26:45,320 --> 01:26:48,051
I want you to meet Eddie
G, he's my twin too,

1552
01:26:48,051 --> 01:26:51,840
and Myra, say hello to Myra.

1553
01:26:56,480 --> 01:26:58,112
- Could you take me home, please?

1554
01:26:58,112 --> 01:27:03,112
Just take me home.

1555
01:27:04,671 --> 01:27:06,754
(crying)

1556
01:27:26,839 --> 01:27:29,089
(retching)

1557
01:27:34,203 --> 01:27:37,110
(crying)

1558
01:27:37,110 --> 01:27:40,050
- Okay, okay, I think
I've got the solution.

1559
01:27:41,470 --> 01:27:45,420
You need a man to feel
safe, to feel loved,

1560
01:27:46,509 --> 01:27:51,170
to feel like a real person,
and I want to marry you.

1561
01:27:54,600 --> 01:27:56,930
- Oh, Mr. Shinn.

1562
01:27:56,930 --> 01:28:00,680
- First of all, call me
Isaac, and just hear me out.

1563
01:28:01,660 --> 01:28:03,930
I'm gonna draw up a prenuptial agreement

1564
01:28:03,930 --> 01:28:07,040
leaving you virtually my
entire estate when I die.

1565
01:28:07,040 --> 01:28:11,880
I'm gonna cut everybody else
out and I am worth millions.

1566
01:28:12,831 --> 01:28:14,631
Does that make you feel safe enough?

1567
01:28:16,240 --> 01:28:19,430
- Mr. Shinn, I mean, Isaac, I,

1568
01:28:21,660 --> 01:28:22,493
why,

1569
01:28:23,710 --> 01:28:27,955
I don't wanna be the one to, you know,

1570
01:28:27,955 --> 01:28:32,950
hurt your family, or take
money from your children.

1571
01:28:32,950 --> 01:28:34,650
- They don't give a damn about me.

1572
01:28:38,990 --> 01:28:43,780
- I'm not in love with you that way.

1573
01:28:44,730 --> 01:28:46,840
- Sweetheart, I know you
don't love me in that way,

1574
01:28:46,840 --> 01:28:49,260
but there are other ways.

1575
01:28:49,260 --> 01:28:50,540
So long as you respect me.

1576
01:28:50,540 --> 01:28:51,800
- Oh, Mr. Shinn, yes, I do.

1577
01:28:51,800 --> 01:28:53,510
- And you trust me.
- Yes, I do.

1578
01:28:53,510 --> 01:28:56,930
- And you know I have your
best interests at heart,

1579
01:28:56,930 --> 01:28:59,583
that's a good foundation for a marriage,

1580
01:28:59,583 --> 01:29:02,440
along with the prenuptial agreement.

1581
01:29:04,200 --> 01:29:09,200
- No, see, I could only marry
for love, not for money.

1582
01:29:14,580 --> 01:29:15,413
No.

1583
01:29:16,400 --> 01:29:19,160
I'm sorry, I just,

1584
01:29:19,160 --> 01:29:21,800
I love you, but I'm not in love with you.

1585
01:29:23,230 --> 01:29:24,540
Please forgive me.

1586
01:29:24,540 --> 01:29:25,580
Please forgive me.

1587
01:29:35,160 --> 01:29:37,770
- Max Leary wants to see you tomorrow.

1588
01:29:37,770 --> 01:29:41,130
He wants to discuss a role
for you in his new picture.

1589
01:29:41,130 --> 01:29:42,730
- Mr. Shinn.

1590
01:29:42,730 --> 01:29:43,563
Isaac.

1591
01:29:45,259 --> 01:29:48,176
(light jazz music)

1592
01:29:49,839 --> 01:29:52,089
(knocking)

1593
01:29:56,103 --> 01:29:57,619
- Marilyn.

1594
01:29:57,619 --> 01:29:58,452
Hello.

1595
01:30:14,182 --> 01:30:15,030
(snaps fingers)

1596
01:30:15,030 --> 01:30:16,482
Daydreaming, honey?

1597
01:30:16,482 --> 01:30:21,482
- No.

1598
01:30:23,630 --> 01:30:24,463
- So.

1599
01:30:25,570 --> 01:30:28,160
You think we can work together, hmm?

1600
01:30:29,620 --> 01:30:31,220
- Yes I do.

1601
01:30:31,220 --> 01:30:32,053
I do.

1602
01:30:33,643 --> 01:30:35,143
- I saw you in Asphalt Jungle.

1603
01:30:36,946 --> 01:30:38,020
I was impressed.

1604
01:30:40,887 --> 01:30:43,627
I'm not forcing you, am I baby?

1605
01:30:43,627 --> 01:30:46,900
- No. (laughs)

1606
01:30:46,900 --> 01:30:49,133
- You're free to leave at any time.

1607
01:31:02,057 --> 01:31:02,890
- It wasn't me, all those times.

1608
01:31:04,956 --> 01:31:05,856
It was my destiny.

1609
01:31:07,450 --> 01:31:11,510
Like a comet, veering toward Earth.

1610
01:31:11,510 --> 01:31:15,060
In the gravitational
pull, you can't resist,

1611
01:31:15,060 --> 01:31:16,210
you try, but you can't.

1612
01:31:19,660 --> 01:31:24,660
So you're afraid that if you
resist, you won't be loved,

1613
01:31:27,845 --> 01:31:32,569
or wanted, or given a chance.

1614
01:31:32,569 --> 01:31:35,236
(phone ringing)

1615
01:31:38,900 --> 01:31:39,733
Hello?

1616
01:31:39,733 --> 01:31:40,566
- Sweetheart?

1617
01:31:40,566 --> 01:31:41,399
We got the part.

1618
01:31:43,210 --> 01:31:44,043
You awake, kid?

1619
01:31:44,043 --> 01:31:46,680
I'm telling you, you got the female lead.

1620
01:31:46,680 --> 01:31:49,080
Max Leary asked for you, we got the part.

1621
01:31:50,230 --> 01:31:52,870
- Oh, that's good news.

1622
01:31:52,870 --> 01:31:54,760
- Good news, it's terrific news.

1623
01:31:55,860 --> 01:31:57,120
So is somebody there with you?

1624
01:31:57,120 --> 01:31:58,510
You don't sound very happy.

1625
01:31:59,405 --> 01:32:00,705
- Oh no, I am, I am happy.

1626
01:32:02,241 --> 01:32:03,720
- You don't sound happy, Norma Jeane.

1627
01:32:03,720 --> 01:32:05,790
I'd like to know why the hell not.

1628
01:32:05,790 --> 01:32:08,800
I bust my ass at the
studio talking you up,

1629
01:32:08,800 --> 01:32:12,854
and you're, oh yes, unhappy.

1630
01:32:12,854 --> 01:32:15,190
Look, I know the part
doesn't make much sense,

1631
01:32:15,190 --> 01:32:18,240
but it's your first starring role!

1632
01:32:18,240 --> 01:32:20,127
Marilyn is on her way!

1633
01:32:22,296 --> 01:32:27,296
(people chattering)
(bell ringing)

1634
01:32:33,955 --> 01:32:34,980
- You need to push yourself, baby.

1635
01:32:34,980 --> 01:32:37,366
- [Man] All right, here we go, folks.

1636
01:32:37,366 --> 01:32:38,350
Roll camera.

1637
01:32:39,800 --> 01:32:40,633
Mark it.

1638
01:32:41,840 --> 01:32:42,690
- Okay, let's go.

1639
01:32:44,360 --> 01:32:45,193
Action.

1640
01:32:48,060 --> 01:32:50,580
- You aren't going to run
out on me, are you Georgie?

1641
01:32:50,580 --> 01:32:52,200
- [George] Hey baby, what
are you talking about?

1642
01:32:52,200 --> 01:32:55,230
- You love me, I know you
love me, I can feel it,

1643
01:32:57,160 --> 01:32:58,810
in my skin and in my bones.

1644
01:32:58,810 --> 01:33:01,130
- That cunning little bitch Marilyn Monroe

1645
01:33:01,130 --> 01:33:03,030
stole every scene we were in together.

1646
01:33:04,041 --> 01:33:05,030
Every scene.

1647
01:33:06,042 --> 01:33:08,442
It was like my guts were
being sucked out of me.

1648
01:33:10,887 --> 01:33:15,010
- I'm sorry, could I just
talk to you for a moment?

1649
01:33:15,010 --> 01:33:15,843
- Cut.

1650
01:33:15,843 --> 01:33:19,390
- Either she can't act at all,
or she's acting all the time.

1651
01:33:19,390 --> 01:33:21,091
Her entire life's an act.

1652
01:33:21,091 --> 01:33:23,506
(bell ringing)

1653
01:33:23,506 --> 01:33:26,646
- I know what Fawn would say,
and these aren't Fawn's words.

1654
01:33:26,646 --> 01:33:28,890
Well, I'd like to rewrite the scene,

1655
01:33:28,890 --> 01:33:31,250
just a few lines, just a little.

1656
01:33:31,250 --> 01:33:34,787
- What if every actress
wants to alter lines?

1657
01:33:34,787 --> 01:33:37,180
- I'm not every actress.

1658
01:33:37,180 --> 01:33:39,330
- You're too intense, Marilyn.

1659
01:33:39,330 --> 01:33:40,540
You're going to wear yourself out.

1660
01:33:40,540 --> 01:33:45,140
- Look, in real life, Fawn
would be used and beaten

1661
01:33:45,140 --> 01:33:47,000
and shared by men, she'd be drinking

1662
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:50,650
and taking drugs and then she'd be dead.

1663
01:33:50,650 --> 01:33:52,460
- She's a character in a movie.

1664
01:33:52,460 --> 01:33:53,340
What's wrong with you?

1665
01:33:53,340 --> 01:33:54,370
- No!

1666
01:33:54,370 --> 01:33:57,410
No, she's real.

1667
01:33:57,410 --> 01:33:59,210
She's inside me, I know her.

1668
01:33:59,210 --> 01:34:00,940
- Are you on pain killers?

1669
01:34:00,940 --> 01:34:03,180
- No, I'm just trying to tell you

1670
01:34:03,180 --> 01:34:05,938
that I don't want Fawn to die.

1671
01:34:05,938 --> 01:34:08,430
- You don't have to
think about this stuff.

1672
01:34:09,484 --> 01:34:11,830
You only have to be Marilyn.

1673
01:34:13,012 --> 01:34:16,200
Nobody wants to listen
to this tortured crap

1674
01:34:16,200 --> 01:34:17,540
out of your mouth.

1675
01:34:17,540 --> 01:34:18,990
Trust me on this, sweetheart.

1676
01:34:20,328 --> 01:34:23,475
- I'm gonna play Fawn my
way because I know her.

1677
01:34:23,475 --> 01:34:26,058
(somber music)

1678
01:34:30,140 --> 01:34:30,973
- Miss Monroe.

1679
01:34:32,156 --> 01:34:34,250
I think I saw your picture
in a magazine the other day.

1680
01:34:34,250 --> 01:34:35,580
- Oh, maybe.

1681
01:34:35,580 --> 01:34:37,360
- I loved you in All About Eve.

1682
01:34:37,360 --> 01:34:39,160
You played a good part.

1683
01:34:39,160 --> 01:34:40,110
- Thank you.

1684
01:34:40,110 --> 01:34:41,460
Is my mother--
- In there.

1685
01:34:50,195 --> 01:34:52,249
- I'll give this to you, some money

1686
01:34:52,249 --> 01:34:53,799
for some things she might need.

1687
01:35:04,510 --> 01:35:05,530
Mother.

1688
01:35:05,530 --> 01:35:06,657
Here you are.

1689
01:35:07,680 --> 01:35:08,513
- You smell.

1690
01:35:11,995 --> 01:35:15,056
- It's the chemical bleach
they use on my hair,

1691
01:35:15,056 --> 01:35:17,425
mixed with Chanel perfume.

1692
01:35:17,425 --> 01:35:20,360
I thought you might enjoy...

1693
01:35:24,781 --> 01:35:27,200
I've been working as an actress, Mother.

1694
01:35:27,200 --> 01:35:28,880
Serious, demanding work.

1695
01:35:32,490 --> 01:35:34,470
Of course, I don't own the dress,

1696
01:35:34,470 --> 01:35:36,960
the studio provided it
for the photo shoot.

1697
01:35:37,830 --> 01:35:39,530
But I know it doesn't look much like me,

1698
01:35:39,530 --> 01:35:41,340
they say Marilyn is very photogenic.

1699
01:35:43,400 --> 01:35:44,233
- Huh.

1700
01:35:47,830 --> 01:35:48,880
Does her father know?

1701
01:35:50,251 --> 01:35:51,251
- My father?

1702
01:35:52,501 --> 01:35:53,334
Know what?

1703
01:35:54,920 --> 01:35:56,230
- About this Marilyn.

1704
01:35:58,370 --> 01:36:00,910
- Well, he wouldn't know
my professional name,

1705
01:36:00,910 --> 01:36:02,010
I guess, how could he?

1706
01:36:04,231 --> 01:36:07,060
Mother, if you told me his name,

1707
01:36:07,060 --> 01:36:08,440
I could send him this magazine,

1708
01:36:08,440 --> 01:36:10,350
I could call him up sometime,

1709
01:36:10,350 --> 01:36:12,050
if he's still living in Hollywood?

1710
01:36:14,710 --> 01:36:17,630
Mother, it would mean so
much to me to know who he is.

1711
01:36:17,630 --> 01:36:18,463
To know him.

1712
01:36:19,335 --> 01:36:21,480
I wouldn't bother him, I promise.

1713
01:36:21,480 --> 01:36:22,313
- No.

1714
01:36:23,235 --> 01:36:27,012
- Mother please, please.

1715
01:36:27,012 --> 01:36:31,437
- No.

1716
01:36:31,437 --> 01:36:34,020
(somber music)

1717
01:36:44,070 --> 01:36:44,903
- [Man] Stop.

1718
01:36:49,444 --> 01:36:50,277
You don't wanna do that.

1719
01:36:51,979 --> 01:36:52,812
Give it to me.

1720
01:37:05,340 --> 01:37:06,840
- [Man] Cut.

1721
01:37:06,840 --> 01:37:07,673
Print it.

1722
01:37:08,848 --> 01:37:11,515
(phone ringing)

1723
01:37:12,872 --> 01:37:14,430
- Hello.

1724
01:37:14,430 --> 01:37:17,110
- You never told me you
did something like this,

1725
01:37:17,110 --> 01:37:18,960
Miss Golden Dreams.

1726
01:37:18,960 --> 01:37:19,793
- Isaac?

1727
01:37:19,793 --> 01:37:20,740
- Right here in front of me.

1728
01:37:20,740 --> 01:37:24,220
It's on the front page along
with US casualties in Korea.

1729
01:37:24,220 --> 01:37:26,050
You're right next to a
picture of the Rosenbergs

1730
01:37:26,050 --> 01:37:28,052
being sentenced to death!

1731
01:37:28,052 --> 01:37:30,640
It's in the Hollywood
Reporter and Variety!

1732
01:37:30,640 --> 01:37:33,760
I mean, when did you do this, 1949?

1733
01:37:33,760 --> 01:37:35,940
You were under contract!

1734
01:37:35,940 --> 01:37:36,773
Ooh, dope.

1735
01:37:38,100 --> 01:37:40,350
- I don't know what you're talking about,

1736
01:37:40,350 --> 01:37:41,420
Miss Golden Dreams?

1737
01:37:41,420 --> 01:37:42,420
What does that mean?

1738
01:37:43,292 --> 01:37:46,330
- It means soft-core porn
with that creep Otto!

1739
01:37:46,330 --> 01:37:50,580
Don't you see, the studio
can suspend you for this,

1740
01:37:50,580 --> 01:37:52,870
and it's at the worst possible time.

1741
01:37:52,870 --> 01:37:54,670
They're considering you for a new film

1742
01:37:54,670 --> 01:37:57,040
opposite Joseph Cotton, Niagara.

1743
01:37:58,062 --> 01:38:01,410
Marilyn was mine too, you dumb broad!

1744
01:38:03,030 --> 01:38:05,780
Marilyn was mine, Marilyn was beautiful,

1745
01:38:05,780 --> 01:38:08,824
and you had no right to despoil her.

1746
01:38:08,824 --> 01:38:09,657
- Isaac.

1747
01:38:09,657 --> 01:38:10,500
(phone clicks, dial tone beeping)

1748
01:38:10,500 --> 01:38:11,333
Hello?

1749
01:38:24,051 --> 01:38:26,800
It's like I'm a commie, I guess.

1750
01:38:26,800 --> 01:38:28,110
All the papers after me.

1751
01:38:30,860 --> 01:38:34,431
- This one here.

1752
01:38:34,431 --> 01:38:37,750
Miss Golden Dreams?

1753
01:38:47,002 --> 01:38:49,509
- I'm not a criminal.

1754
01:38:49,509 --> 01:38:54,509
I posed nude once in my entire
life because I was desperate.

1755
01:38:54,850 --> 01:38:55,683
$50.

1756
01:38:57,354 --> 01:38:59,270
It's just a silly picture.

1757
01:38:59,270 --> 01:39:03,020
- Didn't you sign an agreement
stipulating that behavior

1758
01:39:03,020 --> 01:39:06,200
contrary to morals of
the Hollywood community

1759
01:39:06,200 --> 01:39:09,710
would result in suspension
of your contract

1760
01:39:09,710 --> 01:39:11,040
or even termination?

1761
01:39:14,637 --> 01:39:17,554
(light jazz music)

1762
01:39:27,153 --> 01:39:30,750
- Did you ever see photos
of the Nazi death camps?

1763
01:39:30,750 --> 01:39:32,230
Or Hiroshima?

1764
01:39:32,230 --> 01:39:36,080
Piles of corpses like
lumber, babies, children.

1765
01:39:37,670 --> 01:39:40,030
That's something to be upset
about, that's pornography,

1766
01:39:40,030 --> 01:39:45,030
not some (laughs) sad, dumb
broad desperate for 50 bucks.

1767
01:39:54,555 --> 01:39:56,705
- I wanted to punish
her for being a tramp,

1768
01:39:57,630 --> 01:40:00,610
and for bleeding on my
beautiful white fur carpet.

1769
01:40:01,910 --> 01:40:03,490
But I couldn't get rid of
her because I was afraid

1770
01:40:03,490 --> 01:40:05,040
she'd be hired by a competitor.

1771
01:40:06,440 --> 01:40:08,250
We ended up forgiving her for the calendar

1772
01:40:08,250 --> 01:40:10,930
and raised her salary
to 1000 bucks a week.

1773
01:40:10,930 --> 01:40:12,790
We couldn't invent another blonde.

1774
01:40:14,030 --> 01:40:16,280
One that could make so
much money so cheap.

1775
01:40:18,244 --> 01:40:20,911
(phone ringing)

1776
01:40:26,889 --> 01:40:28,493
- Isaac?

1777
01:40:28,493 --> 01:40:31,210
- [Betty] No, this is Betty,
Mr. Shinn's secretary.

1778
01:40:31,210 --> 01:40:32,043
- Betty?

1779
01:40:32,960 --> 01:40:33,950
- [Betty] Norma Jeane.

1780
01:40:35,290 --> 01:40:36,790
Are you sitting down?
- What?

1781
01:40:38,484 --> 01:40:40,810
- [Betty] Mr. Shinn, he's dead.

1782
01:40:41,740 --> 01:40:43,310
His heart.

1783
01:40:43,310 --> 01:40:45,700
- What?
(somber music)

1784
01:40:47,568 --> 01:40:48,401
It was me.

1785
01:40:49,850 --> 01:40:52,754
It was my fault.

1786
01:40:52,754 --> 01:40:56,300
Oh Betty, he died over nothing. (crying)

1787
01:40:57,529 --> 01:40:58,919
Oh god.

1788
01:40:58,919 --> 01:41:01,061
(phone clatters)

1789
01:41:01,061 --> 01:41:03,311
(retching)

1790
01:41:08,469 --> 01:41:10,552
(crying)

1791
01:41:30,782 --> 01:41:33,782
(upbeat jazz music)

1792
01:41:38,933 --> 01:41:41,460
Mr. Shinn was my friend.

1793
01:41:41,460 --> 01:41:42,760
Maybe my only real friend.

1794
01:41:44,110 --> 01:41:45,783
- Well, that's the first thing

1795
01:41:45,783 --> 01:41:46,630
you have to learn about Hollywood.

1796
01:41:46,630 --> 01:41:48,690
Your agent is never your friend.

1797
01:41:48,690 --> 01:41:52,110
It's the business we're in.

1798
01:41:52,110 --> 01:41:53,960
Acting is the only profession I know.

1799
01:41:54,960 --> 01:41:56,930
- There's our girl.

1800
01:41:56,930 --> 01:41:58,720
Woohoo.

1801
01:41:58,720 --> 01:42:00,520
- What's this, no more fraternizing.

1802
01:42:01,393 --> 01:42:02,830
- With all the bucks I'm
investing in this movie,

1803
01:42:02,830 --> 01:42:05,640
do I get to boogie with the star?

1804
01:42:05,640 --> 01:42:07,030
(laughing)

1805
01:42:07,030 --> 01:42:08,510
- Joseph Cotton is
really the star, Mister.

1806
01:42:09,530 --> 01:42:12,210
- Well dang, I don't wanna dance with him.

1807
01:42:12,210 --> 01:42:14,613
I just wanna see if these things are real.

1808
01:42:14,613 --> 01:42:16,630
- Trust me, they're real.

1809
01:42:16,630 --> 01:42:18,020
- We're gonna have to (mumbling).

1810
01:42:19,809 --> 01:42:21,480
- You're not being very friendly.

1811
01:42:21,480 --> 01:42:22,590
- I'm sorry.

1812
01:42:22,590 --> 01:42:23,900
- Come on, let's party.

1813
01:42:27,189 --> 01:42:28,400
(gasps)

1814
01:42:28,400 --> 01:42:31,425
- You don't belong with people
who don't love you, Norma.

1815
01:42:31,425 --> 01:42:36,425
- Oh Cass, I've missed you.

1816
01:42:37,305 --> 01:42:40,809
- Come with us.

1817
01:42:40,809 --> 01:42:43,809
(upbeat jazz music)

1818
01:42:46,032 --> 01:42:47,943
Oh, this is great.

1819
01:42:47,943 --> 01:42:49,752
Here we are.

1820
01:42:49,752 --> 01:42:54,752
- [Norma Jeane] Let me out,
let me out, let me out!

1821
01:42:55,017 --> 01:42:57,318
Let me out!

1822
01:42:57,318 --> 01:42:59,111
- Oh, the sea air.

1823
01:42:59,111 --> 01:43:02,692
- Where did you guys get
this car, it's so great!

1824
01:43:02,692 --> 01:43:04,363
- We borrowed it?
- We borrow everything.

1825
01:43:04,363 --> 01:43:06,720
- Come, come, come, come, come, come.

1826
01:43:06,720 --> 01:43:07,891
- [Cass] Whoa, watch your step, baby.

1827
01:43:07,891 --> 01:43:09,326
(Norma Jeane screams)

1828
01:43:09,326 --> 01:43:11,683
(laughing)

1829
01:43:11,683 --> 01:43:14,429
- You saved me, I'm free, I'm free!

1830
01:43:14,429 --> 01:43:16,679
(laughing)

1831
01:43:21,449 --> 01:43:26,449
- Oh.

1832
01:43:30,824 --> 01:43:31,657
- Wait.

1833
01:43:31,657 --> 01:43:34,515
- It's okay.

1834
01:43:34,515 --> 01:43:37,015
(light music)

1835
01:43:58,920 --> 01:44:00,085
(light jazz music)

1836
01:44:00,085 --> 01:44:04,970
(bell ringing)
(people chattering)

1837
01:44:04,970 --> 01:44:06,953
- Oh, the lights, the set.

1838
01:44:06,953 --> 01:44:07,786
Ah.

1839
01:44:09,949 --> 01:44:11,249
Have you seen Miss Monroe?

1840
01:44:12,460 --> 01:44:13,410
- She's over there.

1841
01:44:15,900 --> 01:44:19,400
- It is time to celebrate,
Miss Golden Dreams.

1842
01:44:20,430 --> 01:44:23,020
- [Norma Jeane] Oh, oh, pretty.

1843
01:44:24,460 --> 01:44:25,740
- Look at us.

1844
01:44:25,740 --> 01:44:27,070
Aren't we beautiful?

1845
01:44:27,070 --> 01:44:27,903
- Yes.

1846
01:44:27,903 --> 01:44:29,850
The mirror, my magic friend.

1847
01:44:29,850 --> 01:44:30,890
- Mine too.

1848
01:44:30,890 --> 01:44:33,627
You know, I set up one to watch
my self even on the toilet.

1849
01:44:33,627 --> 01:44:35,282
(laughing)

1850
01:44:35,282 --> 01:44:36,886
- That's it, Miss Monroe.

1851
01:44:36,886 --> 01:44:38,430
I'll tell them you're ready.

1852
01:44:38,430 --> 01:44:39,263
- Could you put these in water?

1853
01:44:39,263 --> 01:44:40,810
And also don't forget to
take some of those cookies

1854
01:44:40,810 --> 01:44:44,360
for your mom, I don't
need cookies. (laughs)

1855
01:44:44,360 --> 01:44:46,000
So they want me to wear
flesh-colored underwear

1856
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:48,110
in this next scene, but I'm gonna go nude.

1857
01:44:48,110 --> 01:44:50,970
They want me to be a slut, I'll be a slut.

1858
01:44:50,970 --> 01:44:52,170
- That's right.

1859
01:44:52,170 --> 01:44:54,660
The human body is meant to be seen,

1860
01:44:54,660 --> 01:44:58,530
not hidden away like some
ugly festering wound.

1861
01:44:58,530 --> 01:45:01,523
- Unless of course it is
an ugly festering wound.

1862
01:45:01,523 --> 01:45:02,986
Then it should be hidden.

1863
01:45:02,986 --> 01:45:05,042
(laughing)

1864
01:45:05,042 --> 01:45:07,948
- Well here's to us.

1865
01:45:07,948 --> 01:45:08,781
Ooh.
- Ooh.

1866
01:45:11,042 --> 01:45:11,875
- Action.

1867
01:45:23,084 --> 01:45:23,917
Cut.

1868
01:45:24,880 --> 01:45:27,190
Rose honey, I love it, but we'll never

1869
01:45:27,190 --> 01:45:28,570
get it past the censor.

1870
01:45:28,570 --> 01:45:30,891
- Oh, but the sheet covers everything.

1871
01:45:30,891 --> 01:45:33,760
- Not really, it's
obvious what you're doing.

1872
01:45:33,760 --> 01:45:35,430
- No, see, this is important.

1873
01:45:35,430 --> 01:45:38,000
Rose is mocking her husband, I mean,

1874
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:39,950
he's impotent, he can't do anything.

1875
01:45:41,200 --> 01:45:45,770
God, this role, it's so
underwritten and unconvincing.

1876
01:45:46,902 --> 01:45:48,490
I wanna write some lines.

1877
01:45:49,950 --> 01:45:51,440
Came to me last night.

1878
01:45:51,440 --> 01:45:53,710
Rose had a baby and the baby died.

1879
01:45:54,970 --> 01:45:58,400
Rose is a woman with a secret.

1880
01:45:58,400 --> 01:45:59,960
See, that's why I'm playing her this way,

1881
01:45:59,960 --> 01:46:01,720
I can remember how it happened.

1882
01:46:01,720 --> 01:46:02,780
- What?

1883
01:46:02,780 --> 01:46:04,330
How what happened?

1884
01:46:04,330 --> 01:46:05,163
- This baby.

1885
01:46:06,412 --> 01:46:10,810
Rose shut it in a bureau
drawer and suffocated.

1886
01:46:12,870 --> 01:46:15,493
She was making love with a man and they

1887
01:46:15,493 --> 01:46:17,990
didn't hear the baby crying in the drawer.

1888
01:46:20,320 --> 01:46:22,520
And when they finished the baby was dead.

1889
01:46:25,371 --> 01:46:27,250
- How the hell do you know that?

1890
01:46:29,143 --> 01:46:30,390
- Hey.

1891
01:46:30,390 --> 01:46:31,223
I know.

1892
01:46:32,120 --> 01:46:36,678
I used to know Rose.

1893
01:46:36,678 --> 01:46:41,678
(upbeat jazz music)
(people chattering)

1894
01:46:56,183 --> 01:46:59,470
Do you remember the day you
invited me to see your aviary?

1895
01:46:59,470 --> 01:47:01,470
I was just a girl then, I was so scared.

1896
01:47:03,240 --> 01:47:04,810
- I don't have an aviary.

1897
01:47:05,800 --> 01:47:09,021
- What about the white fur rug?

1898
01:47:09,021 --> 01:47:13,911
I got blood on your white
fur rug and you yelled at me.

1899
01:47:13,911 --> 01:47:15,400
(laughing)

1900
01:47:15,400 --> 01:47:19,550
- Afraid I do not, Miss Monroe,
I have no white fur rug.

1901
01:47:21,090 --> 01:47:26,090
Excuse me.

1902
01:47:30,237 --> 01:47:35,237
- Marilyn, as your agent,
I have a word of advice.

1903
01:47:35,883 --> 01:47:38,180
Just smile, don't make trouble.

1904
01:47:39,140 --> 01:47:40,850
Don't sabotage yourself.

1905
01:47:42,210 --> 01:47:43,043
Another thing,

1906
01:47:44,580 --> 01:47:48,140
don't ever mention that your
mother is in a mental hospital.

1907
01:47:48,140 --> 01:47:49,640
Niagara's gonna make a bundle.

1908
01:47:50,678 --> 01:47:53,477
Everybody's gonna be talking
about Marilyn Monroe.

1909
01:47:58,430 --> 01:48:00,830
- The number one sex
symbol of the 20th century.

1910
01:48:01,978 --> 01:48:02,890
What a laugh.

1911
01:48:04,660 --> 01:48:07,150
She wasn't even good at making love.

1912
01:48:07,150 --> 01:48:08,600
Basically she never knew how.

1913
01:48:10,146 --> 01:48:13,806
Oh sure, her body was this gorgeous thing.

1914
01:48:13,806 --> 01:48:15,406
She'd stare at it in the mirror.

1915
01:48:16,850 --> 01:48:19,490
But she never knew how to operate it.

1916
01:48:19,490 --> 01:48:21,260
Neither did anybody else.

1917
01:48:21,260 --> 01:48:24,340
Norma darling, you are a star, and this

1918
01:48:24,340 --> 01:48:25,861
is where a star should live.

1919
01:48:25,861 --> 01:48:27,097
(Norma Jeane squeals)

1920
01:48:27,097 --> 01:48:28,304
(laughing)

1921
01:48:28,304 --> 01:48:30,014
- Oh my god, it's beautiful.

1922
01:48:30,014 --> 01:48:31,352
I mean, I don't know how
I'm gonna pay for it,

1923
01:48:31,352 --> 01:48:32,690
'cause I had to throw in
the money for the lease,

1924
01:48:32,690 --> 01:48:33,670
but it's beautiful!

1925
01:48:33,670 --> 01:48:35,623
- No no no, don't worry.

1926
01:48:35,623 --> 01:48:36,780
(laughing)

1927
01:48:36,780 --> 01:48:37,613
We'll help you.

1928
01:48:37,613 --> 01:48:39,110
- Absolutely, when we got a job.

1929
01:48:39,110 --> 01:48:40,930
But you know what we need
is some decent furniture.

1930
01:48:40,930 --> 01:48:41,940
Dining room table.

1931
01:48:41,940 --> 01:48:44,482
- We'll cook, we'll entertain.

1932
01:48:44,482 --> 01:48:46,640
The beautiful parties, black tie.

1933
01:48:47,915 --> 01:48:50,650
- [Marilyn] And it'll be like
a home, a real home, and--

1934
01:48:50,650 --> 01:48:52,955
- That's right, my love, a haven.

1935
01:48:52,955 --> 01:48:55,150
I'll even unpack my suitcase.

1936
01:48:55,150 --> 01:48:56,783
- I won't be alone?

1937
01:48:56,783 --> 01:48:57,616
Hmm.

1938
01:48:57,616 --> 01:48:59,220
- Norma, I wanna show you something.

1939
01:49:01,310 --> 01:49:03,022
It's better at night than in day.

1940
01:49:03,022 --> 01:49:03,855
- Oh.

1941
01:49:05,991 --> 01:49:08,908
(insects chirping)

1942
01:49:10,731 --> 01:49:13,690
You know, I read that the
universe is billions of years old,

1943
01:49:13,690 --> 01:49:17,390
and it began in a single
explosion from a tiny particle.

1944
01:49:18,815 --> 01:49:20,565
The fact of a star is it burns out.

1945
01:49:21,760 --> 01:49:23,512
Celestial stars or human.

1946
01:49:23,512 --> 01:49:24,700
(chuckles)

1947
01:49:24,700 --> 01:49:25,750
- I'll drink to that.

1948
01:49:26,827 --> 01:49:28,341
(laughs)

1949
01:49:28,341 --> 01:49:29,315
(glass shatters)

1950
01:49:29,315 --> 01:49:33,230
Oh, god.
(laughing)

1951
01:49:34,090 --> 01:49:34,923
Blood vow.

1952
01:49:36,025 --> 01:49:36,858
Come here.

1953
01:49:38,975 --> 01:49:41,360
We're the Gemini, the three of us.

1954
01:49:41,360 --> 01:49:43,611
Like the twins, only there's three.

1955
01:49:43,611 --> 01:49:45,870
- Mm-hmm.

1956
01:49:45,870 --> 01:49:47,500
- Always love one another.

1957
01:49:47,500 --> 01:49:50,407
- In sickness and in health.

1958
01:49:51,531 --> 01:49:53,402
(laughs)

1959
01:49:53,402 --> 01:49:56,066
- Till death do we part.

1960
01:49:56,066 --> 01:49:58,316
(laughing)

1961
01:50:14,300 --> 01:50:18,500
- Well, Mrs. Perig, you're
about five weeks pregnant.

1962
01:50:20,090 --> 01:50:21,790
The baby will arrive in mid-April.

1963
01:50:22,986 --> 01:50:24,760
- What?

1964
01:50:24,760 --> 01:50:26,430
- It'll be all right.

1965
01:50:26,430 --> 01:50:27,860
You're in excellent health.

1966
01:50:27,860 --> 01:50:31,993
- Oh no, I'm happy, I'm so happy.

1967
01:50:33,220 --> 01:50:35,470
I want this baby.

1968
01:50:35,470 --> 01:50:39,480
My husband and I, we've
been trying for years.

1969
01:50:40,357 --> 01:50:41,257
This is wonderful.

1970
01:50:44,063 --> 01:50:46,980
(light jazz music)

1971
01:50:50,527 --> 01:50:52,527
(sighs)

1972
01:50:55,280 --> 01:50:59,070
- Norma, dear, what is
it, you look fraught.

1973
01:51:03,520 --> 01:51:04,353
- Well,

1974
01:51:07,097 --> 01:51:09,450
I don't know which one,

1975
01:51:10,542 --> 01:51:15,542
so I guess you're both
about to become fathers.

1976
01:51:20,270 --> 01:51:21,103
- Oh.

1977
01:51:23,300 --> 01:51:24,133
Norma.

1978
01:51:26,110 --> 01:51:27,327
You think you are?

1979
01:51:28,260 --> 01:51:29,093
- Yes.

1980
01:51:30,400 --> 01:51:33,110
Well, I mean, it's what
I've always wanted,

1981
01:51:33,110 --> 01:51:34,850
you're happy for me, aren't you?

1982
01:51:34,850 --> 01:51:36,150
- Yes, of course.

1983
01:51:36,150 --> 01:51:38,360
- It's wonderful.

1984
01:51:39,363 --> 01:51:43,190
It's just that Cass and I
aren't working, and a baby.

1985
01:51:43,190 --> 01:51:45,200
- Well no, see, I got it all figured out,

1986
01:51:45,200 --> 01:51:46,590
I'm gonna postpone my next film,

1987
01:51:46,590 --> 01:51:51,220
and I can make money being
photographed for magazines,

1988
01:51:51,220 --> 01:51:53,930
and well, I won't show
for three or four months,

1989
01:51:53,930 --> 01:51:58,850
and I'm gonna let my hair grow
out, I'm gonna be natural.

1990
01:52:00,051 --> 01:52:00,884
(laughs)

1991
01:52:00,884 --> 01:52:02,261
- Waiter, I think we need a couple

1992
01:52:02,261 --> 01:52:04,170
of bottles of wine over here.

1993
01:52:04,170 --> 01:52:05,678
- We're celebrating.

1994
01:52:05,678 --> 01:52:07,928
(laughing)

1995
01:52:13,898 --> 01:52:16,890
- It's good, the wakeup call, you know?

1996
01:52:16,890 --> 01:52:18,000
I'm gonna join AA.

1997
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:21,230
- You're right, this is the
time to go on the wagon.

1998
01:52:21,230 --> 01:52:23,720
We're not getting any
younger, or any healthier.

1999
01:52:25,665 --> 01:52:27,450
- We need a house.

2000
01:52:27,450 --> 01:52:32,350
We need a big house, with
land, and trees and a view.

2001
01:52:33,290 --> 01:52:35,400
- Where will you get
the money for a house?

2002
01:52:35,400 --> 01:52:37,980
- You're in our hands now, my darling.

2003
01:52:37,980 --> 01:52:38,813
Leave it to us.

2004
01:52:40,150 --> 01:52:42,250
- We should take out insurance,
in case one of us dies,

2005
01:52:42,250 --> 01:52:44,429
that way we know the
baby will taken care of.

2006
01:52:44,429 --> 01:52:46,678
- I don't wanna talk about dying.

2007
01:52:46,678 --> 01:52:51,678
Oh, look!

2008
01:52:52,549 --> 01:52:54,549
(sighs)

2009
01:52:55,498 --> 01:52:57,538
Little tiger.

2010
01:52:57,538 --> 01:53:02,538
I had one like him once at the orphanage.

2011
01:53:03,919 --> 01:53:06,173
(glass shatters)
(Norma Jeane squeals)

2012
01:53:06,173 --> 01:53:09,256
(Norma Jeane laughs)

2013
01:53:10,660 --> 01:53:12,480
- Baby's first play thing.

2014
01:53:12,480 --> 01:53:13,600
Cute.

2015
01:53:13,600 --> 01:53:17,360
That was Norma Jeane
Baker, when we knew her.

2016
01:53:19,300 --> 01:53:20,500
When we were the Gemini.

2017
01:53:22,420 --> 01:53:23,570
Before she betrayed us.

2018
01:53:25,040 --> 01:53:26,290
Or maybe we betrayed her.

2019
01:53:28,602 --> 01:53:29,435
A long time ago.

2020
01:53:35,250 --> 01:53:36,500
- You can't turn it down.

2021
01:53:37,420 --> 01:53:38,970
Will you listen to me, please?

2022
01:53:40,457 --> 01:53:42,660
- I'm sorry, yes, what?

2023
01:53:42,660 --> 01:53:44,480
- You've never done musical comedy before.

2024
01:53:44,480 --> 01:53:46,280
This is a fantastic opportunity.

2025
01:53:47,730 --> 01:53:48,590
And the deal is--

2026
01:53:48,590 --> 01:53:49,680
- Musical comedy?

2027
01:53:49,680 --> 01:53:52,050
I can't dance and I can't sing.

2028
01:53:52,050 --> 01:53:53,100
- Very funny.

2029
01:53:53,100 --> 01:53:55,230
You're the next Carol Lombard.

2030
01:53:55,230 --> 01:53:56,890
You've been taking lessons, everybody says

2031
01:53:56,890 --> 01:53:59,400
you're very promising, a natural talent.

2032
01:53:59,400 --> 01:54:03,971
- I can't, I'm sorry, not
now, my personal life,

2033
01:54:03,971 --> 01:54:07,400
you know, I'm not just
some thing in the movies.

2034
01:54:07,400 --> 01:54:09,550
- [Agent] Marilyn, what,
I didn't quite hear.

2035
01:54:09,550 --> 01:54:11,200
- How much would I get?

2036
01:54:11,200 --> 01:54:12,160
- Contract salary.

2037
01:54:12,160 --> 01:54:15,013
$1500 a week, the
estimate around 12 weeks.

2038
01:54:15,013 --> 01:54:15,846
- Mm-hmm.

2039
01:54:16,730 --> 01:54:19,130
How much would Jane Russell get?

2040
01:54:19,130 --> 01:54:21,480
- The deal is pending,
figures aren't finalized.

2041
01:54:21,480 --> 01:54:22,940
- [Marilyn] How much?

2042
01:54:23,810 --> 01:54:27,653
- Well they're asking $100,000.

2043
01:54:27,653 --> 01:54:29,550
(laughing)

2044
01:54:29,550 --> 01:54:30,800
- And I'm the blonde.

2045
01:54:30,800 --> 01:54:32,840
I'm going to hang up now, goodbye.

2046
01:54:32,840 --> 01:54:34,212
- [Agent] Marilyn, wait--

2047
01:54:34,212 --> 01:54:35,812
- Screw Marilyn, she isn't here.

2048
01:54:36,743 --> 01:54:38,070
(phone hangs up)

2049
01:54:38,070 --> 01:54:40,740
- I bought it for her, the
the role of Laura Liley.

2050
01:54:40,740 --> 01:54:44,230
I didn't want Carol Channing
from the Broadway production.

2051
01:54:44,230 --> 01:54:47,490
I wanted it as a showcase
for Marilyn Monroe.

2052
01:54:47,490 --> 01:54:50,450
Since Niagara she was our
highest grossing actress,

2053
01:54:50,450 --> 01:54:52,850
although in my estimation
she was still a tramp.

2054
01:54:54,010 --> 01:54:57,410
- When you had me, Mother,
you weren't married, I guess,

2055
01:54:57,410 --> 01:54:59,980
you didn't have a man supporting you.

2056
01:54:59,980 --> 01:55:00,930
Yet you had a baby.

2057
01:55:02,430 --> 01:55:03,930
Oh, you were so brave, Mother.

2058
01:55:05,040 --> 01:55:05,873
To have me.

2059
01:55:07,730 --> 01:55:11,505
I mean to not get rid of me.

2060
01:55:11,505 --> 01:55:13,160
- You're so old.

2061
01:55:14,480 --> 01:55:15,460
Your hair is white.

2062
01:55:16,396 --> 01:55:18,421
(laughs)

2063
01:55:18,421 --> 01:55:19,254
- Oh Mother.

2064
01:55:21,160 --> 01:55:22,560
It's preposterous, isn't it?

2065
01:55:23,530 --> 01:55:24,740
How can I do this?

2066
01:55:25,630 --> 01:55:27,770
A baby and no husband?

2067
01:55:28,945 --> 01:55:30,830
I shoulda married Mr. Shinn.

2068
01:55:32,416 --> 01:55:34,580
You wanna know something funny?

2069
01:55:34,580 --> 01:55:37,650
He didn't leave me anything, not a penny.

2070
01:55:39,689 --> 01:55:42,420
He just made me a slave to
the studio for seven years.

2071
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:46,130
You know how much money I have?

2072
01:55:46,130 --> 01:55:47,230
$18.

2073
01:55:48,110 --> 01:55:50,810
$18 and I'm supposed to be a movie star.

2074
01:55:56,155 --> 01:55:56,988
I love Cass.

2075
01:55:58,860 --> 01:56:00,510
But I'm not sure I can trust him.

2076
01:56:02,260 --> 01:56:05,909
Eddie G either.

2077
01:56:05,909 --> 01:56:09,390
Maybe they want me to die in childbirth

2078
01:56:09,390 --> 01:56:10,690
and collect the insurance.

2079
01:56:13,650 --> 01:56:14,900
They're just little boys.

2080
01:56:16,710 --> 01:56:17,543
Children.

2081
01:56:19,080 --> 01:56:20,310
Expensive children.

2082
01:56:21,850 --> 01:56:24,150
- Your mother's been doing so well.

2083
01:56:24,150 --> 01:56:25,630
But there are lapses.

2084
01:56:26,710 --> 01:56:30,830
Paranoid schizophrenia
is a mystery illness.

2085
01:56:30,830 --> 01:56:35,250
It reminds me of multiple
sclerosis, a syndrome of symptoms.

2086
01:56:37,940 --> 01:56:41,180
- Is it inherited?

2087
01:56:42,150 --> 01:56:46,280
- Well, it has been
noticed, in some families,

2088
01:56:46,280 --> 01:56:48,260
a certain tendency.

2089
01:56:50,220 --> 01:56:52,830
- My father was normal, very normal.

2090
01:56:52,830 --> 01:56:55,510
He died in Spain in 1936.

2091
01:56:55,510 --> 01:56:58,210
Actually, he was killed in the war.

2092
01:57:01,610 --> 01:57:02,950
- Slugger.

2093
01:57:02,950 --> 01:57:03,783
What do you say?

2094
01:57:04,650 --> 01:57:06,237
What, you just fly in?

2095
01:57:06,237 --> 01:57:07,170
- Yeah.

2096
01:57:07,170 --> 01:57:10,640
- Hey, tell Gino who's here,
tell him to put some steaks on.

2097
01:57:10,640 --> 01:57:11,670
- [Waiter] Yes sir.

2098
01:57:11,670 --> 01:57:15,850
- Listen, this blonde, Marilyn Monroe?

2099
01:57:18,030 --> 01:57:18,863
- [Man] So?

2100
01:57:18,863 --> 01:57:19,696
What about her?

2101
01:57:19,696 --> 01:57:21,520
- I'd like to date her.

2102
01:57:21,520 --> 01:57:23,070
- Her?

2103
01:57:23,070 --> 01:57:24,830
This broad's a tramp.

2104
01:57:24,830 --> 01:57:26,200
She's been a tramp from the get-go.

2105
01:57:26,200 --> 01:57:28,548
She's a bottle blonde, a cow.

2106
01:57:28,548 --> 01:57:30,070
She don't wear underwear.

2107
01:57:31,600 --> 01:57:34,660
She pals around with Jews
and lives with two junkies.

2108
01:57:34,660 --> 01:57:38,870
She's serviced every guy in
town, and more outta town.

2109
01:57:38,870 --> 01:57:40,730
Little girl can't get enough.

2110
01:57:40,730 --> 01:57:41,930
- I just wanna date her.

2111
01:57:42,780 --> 01:57:43,880
Make the arrangements.

2112
01:57:44,928 --> 01:57:47,595
(cha cha music)

2113
01:57:52,172 --> 01:57:53,005
- I'm not merchandise.

2114
01:57:53,840 --> 01:57:56,880
My illustrious agent says
this guy wants to date me,

2115
01:57:56,880 --> 01:57:58,790
and you know what that means.

2116
01:57:58,790 --> 01:58:00,630
- He's famous, must be rich.

2117
01:58:01,864 --> 01:58:03,980
I think Rin-Tin-Tin's
right, you should meet him.

2118
01:58:03,980 --> 01:58:06,539
- Yeah, she could play hard to get.

2119
01:58:06,539 --> 01:58:07,896
- Or hard to get into.

2120
01:58:07,896 --> 01:58:08,840
Great role for Marilyn.

2121
01:58:08,840 --> 01:58:11,890
- I'm not gonna meet him, I
hate baseball and I'm pregnant.

2122
01:58:13,712 --> 01:58:16,020
Cass, I thought you said you
weren't gonna drink anymore.

2123
01:58:16,020 --> 01:58:19,040
- Well you're so healthy
and sane about all this

2124
01:58:19,040 --> 01:58:20,140
that one of the Gemini has to crack up.

2125
01:58:20,140 --> 01:58:22,639
I don't mind if the direction is me.

2126
01:58:22,639 --> 01:58:24,220
- You serious, Cass?

2127
01:58:24,220 --> 01:58:26,460
I can't support everybody.

2128
01:58:26,460 --> 01:58:28,170
- She's right, Cass, you know
we should draw up our wills

2129
01:58:28,170 --> 01:58:29,680
and our insurance promises.

2130
01:58:29,680 --> 01:58:31,530
- That's a terrific idea, Eddie.

2131
01:58:32,430 --> 01:58:35,731
Yeah, I worry about the kid sometimes.

2132
01:58:35,731 --> 01:58:37,930
You know, the San Andreas fault.

2133
01:58:37,930 --> 01:58:40,380
- You know, you guys, you
aren't listening to me.

2134
01:58:40,380 --> 01:58:42,582
We don't have any money.

2135
01:58:42,582 --> 01:58:45,860
All you do is sit around
here all day drinking,

2136
01:58:45,860 --> 01:58:48,160
and I don't know what
to do, Cass, I don't,

2137
01:58:48,160 --> 01:58:50,148
I don't know what to do.

2138
01:58:50,148 --> 01:58:51,510
- You're no fun anymore, Norma.

2139
01:58:51,510 --> 01:58:53,976
Why don't you just relax and join us?

2140
01:58:53,976 --> 01:58:56,400
I think little mama
needs a tequila, Eddie G.

2141
01:59:01,822 --> 01:59:03,905
(laughs)

2142
01:59:08,944 --> 01:59:11,194
(laughing)

2143
01:59:12,943 --> 01:59:14,560
- I don't know what else to do.

2144
01:59:14,560 --> 01:59:18,610
I can't count on them
for anything, I'm alone.

2145
01:59:19,879 --> 01:59:21,980
- All right, now,
Marilyn, what I'm gonna do

2146
01:59:21,980 --> 01:59:24,900
is turn you over to my assistant Yvette.

2147
01:59:24,900 --> 01:59:26,450
You know Yvette.

2148
01:59:26,450 --> 01:59:27,660
She'll help you, okay?

2149
01:59:28,592 --> 01:59:30,675
(crying)

2150
02:00:05,053 --> 02:00:07,440
- Don't worry, Marilyn,
it's all taken care of.

2151
02:00:07,440 --> 02:00:10,120
It's a clinic, nothing
backstreet or dangerous.

2152
02:00:10,120 --> 02:00:11,480
- I've changed my mind.

2153
02:00:11,480 --> 02:00:12,930
- You won't feel a thing.

2154
02:00:12,930 --> 02:00:16,710
- No, I've changed my mind.

2155
02:00:17,760 --> 02:00:19,990
- I have arranged everything.

2156
02:00:19,990 --> 02:00:22,920
You have a new apartment,
we'll take you there after.

2157
02:00:22,920 --> 02:00:25,830
You never have to see
those degenerates again.

2158
02:00:25,830 --> 02:00:27,330
- My mind is my own to change.

2159
02:00:29,030 --> 02:00:29,863
It is.

2160
02:00:32,713 --> 02:00:33,546
- [Nurse] It's all right.

2161
02:00:35,110 --> 02:00:36,190
- Wait.

2162
02:00:36,190 --> 02:00:39,300
Please, this is a mistake,
I don't want to do this,

2163
02:00:39,300 --> 02:00:42,190
please don't, I made a mistake.

2164
02:00:42,190 --> 02:00:43,530
- It's all right, dear, it's all right.

2165
02:00:43,530 --> 02:00:45,050
- Just please, I don't
wanna do this, I don't.

2166
02:00:45,050 --> 02:00:47,141
- [Doctor] Don't worry, my
dear, you're in good hands.

2167
02:00:47,141 --> 02:00:49,310
- I don't wanna do this, no,
this is a mistake, please.

2168
02:00:50,806 --> 02:00:52,170
- Don't worry about me.

2169
02:00:52,170 --> 02:00:54,720
I've got a golf date
with Bing Crosby later.

2170
02:00:54,720 --> 02:00:55,700
- Please don't look at me.

2171
02:00:55,700 --> 02:00:57,670
Don't take my picture,
don't take my picture.

2172
02:00:57,670 --> 02:00:59,080
- Don't struggle, please.

2173
02:00:59,080 --> 02:01:00,430
There will be minimal pain,

2174
02:01:01,309 --> 02:01:06,309
and then this injection will
produce a light twilight sleep.

2175
02:01:15,020 --> 02:01:17,890
You don't understand, this is a mistake.

2176
02:01:20,349 --> 02:01:21,790
This isn't me.

2177
02:01:25,156 --> 02:01:27,739
(gentle music)

2178
02:01:29,070 --> 02:01:29,903
- Wait!

2179
02:01:31,272 --> 02:01:36,272
- Come back here.

2180
02:01:36,651 --> 02:01:39,151
(baby crying)

2181
02:01:58,047 --> 02:02:00,380
(screaming)

2182
02:02:08,972 --> 02:02:11,555
(somber music)

2183
02:02:14,131 --> 02:02:17,381
- Miss Monroe, they're waiting for you.

2184
02:02:21,483 --> 02:02:22,316
- Okay.

2185
02:02:30,826 --> 02:02:33,435
- The codine will help with the pain,

2186
02:02:33,435 --> 02:02:36,390
and the benzodrine will
give you quick energy.

2187
02:02:36,390 --> 02:02:37,370
- Nembutol?

2188
02:02:37,370 --> 02:02:39,190
- Sound sleep.

2189
02:02:39,190 --> 02:02:40,520
Dreamless sleep.

2190
02:02:41,566 --> 02:02:44,040
Think of me as your
closest friend, Marilyn.

2191
02:02:45,130 --> 02:02:47,610
Anything you need, call Dr. Bob.

2192
02:02:59,770 --> 02:03:02,770
(upbeat jazz music)

2193
02:03:03,695 --> 02:03:08,584
â™ª I've heard of affairs
that are strictly platonic â™ª

2194
02:03:08,584 --> 02:03:13,564
â™ª But diamonds are a girl's best friend â™ª

2195
02:03:13,564 --> 02:03:18,564
â™ª And I think affairs that
you must keep masonic â™ª

2196
02:03:18,768 --> 02:03:23,768
â™ª Are better bets if little
pets get big bagettes â™ª

2197
02:03:24,216 --> 02:03:26,872
â™ª Time rolls on â™ª

2198
02:03:26,872 --> 02:03:29,044
â™ª And youth is gone â™ª

2199
02:03:29,044 --> 02:03:34,044
â™ª And you can't straighten
up when you bend â™ª

2200
02:03:34,188 --> 02:03:36,980
â™ª But stiff back or stiff knees â™ª

2201
02:03:36,980 --> 02:03:41,980
â™ª You stand straight at Tiffany's â™ª

2202
02:03:43,940 --> 02:03:48,940
â™ª Diamonds â™ª

2203
02:03:49,479 --> 02:03:54,479
â™ª Diamonds â™ª

2204
02:03:55,896 --> 02:04:00,364
â™ª I don't mean rhinestones â™ª

2205
02:04:00,364 --> 02:04:04,192
â™ª But diamonds â™ª

2206
02:04:04,192 --> 02:04:09,192
â™ª Are a girl's best â™ª

2207
02:04:09,844 --> 02:04:12,344
â™ª Best friend â™ª

2208
02:04:17,032 --> 02:04:18,724
- [Man] Cut, perfect.

2209
02:04:18,724 --> 02:04:22,974
(people chattering and applauding)

2210
02:04:30,180 --> 02:04:31,740
- For this I killed my baby.

2211
02:04:40,563 --> 02:04:43,480
(light jazz music)

2212
02:04:45,248 --> 02:04:48,476
- I think I'll have the
filet of sol, asparagus,

2213
02:04:48,476 --> 02:04:50,743
I'll have a steak, rare,
baked potato, no sour cream.

2214
02:05:01,280 --> 02:05:02,730
So, how'd you get your start?

2215
02:05:03,640 --> 02:05:04,500
- What start?

2216
02:05:04,500 --> 02:05:06,220
- The movie business, acting.

2217
02:05:06,220 --> 02:05:07,053
- Oh, right.

2218
02:05:08,080 --> 02:05:09,810
Yeah, I don't know.

2219
02:05:09,810 --> 02:05:13,790
I was discovered, I guess.

2220
02:05:13,790 --> 02:05:15,850
Well, I acted in high school.

2221
02:05:15,850 --> 02:05:18,460
I was Juliet in Romeo and Juliet.

2222
02:05:18,460 --> 02:05:21,090
I had a wonderful acting teacher

2223
02:05:21,090 --> 02:05:24,451
and he taught me to believe in myself,

2224
02:05:24,451 --> 02:05:28,686
and now I'm doing my first musical comedy,

2225
02:05:28,686 --> 02:05:31,770
big budget production of
Gentlemen Prefer Blondes.

2226
02:05:31,770 --> 02:05:36,303
I'm frightened, the eyes of
the world and all that, so.

2227
02:05:40,069 --> 02:05:41,160
What about you?

2228
02:05:42,380 --> 02:05:44,290
- Well, I've always loved baseball,

2229
02:05:44,290 --> 02:05:46,150
from the time I was a little boy.

2230
02:05:46,150 --> 02:05:47,340
It's almost a religion.

2231
02:05:48,900 --> 02:05:50,320
And I sure didn't want to be fisherman

2232
02:05:50,320 --> 02:05:51,590
like my father and my brothers.

2233
02:05:51,590 --> 02:05:55,640
I was just no good at it,
being in a boat, the ocean.

2234
02:05:56,710 --> 02:05:57,543
Dying fish.
(laughs)

2235
02:05:57,543 --> 02:05:58,440
- I don't blame you.

2236
02:05:58,440 --> 02:05:59,273
Poor fish.

2237
02:06:02,618 --> 02:06:05,520
I used to love softball.

2238
02:06:05,520 --> 02:06:06,353
- Really?

2239
02:06:06,353 --> 02:06:08,030
- Yes, yes.

2240
02:06:08,030 --> 02:06:11,820
Well, in high school, sometimes
I played with the boys,

2241
02:06:11,820 --> 02:06:14,494
when they let me. (laughs)

2242
02:06:14,494 --> 02:06:16,130
- What was your position?

2243
02:06:16,130 --> 02:06:19,897
- I guess batter? (laughs)

2244
02:06:19,897 --> 02:06:21,210
- When they let you.

2245
02:06:22,050 --> 02:06:23,493
- Yeah.

2246
02:06:23,493 --> 02:06:24,450
Yeah.

2247
02:06:24,450 --> 02:06:26,370
- So yeah, baseball was my ticket out,

2248
02:06:26,370 --> 02:06:27,870
and I've always been grateful.

2249
02:06:29,844 --> 02:06:30,830
But you know, I've got to admit,

2250
02:06:31,990 --> 02:06:33,690
it's lonely now that I've retired.

2251
02:06:36,021 --> 02:06:40,630
- Well, you don't seem, I mean,
you're always in the papers,

2252
02:06:40,630 --> 02:06:43,100
it doesn't seem like you're retired.

2253
02:06:43,100 --> 02:06:45,070
- Hey, I'm not in the papers
as much as you, Marilyn.

2254
02:06:45,070 --> 02:06:49,053
- Oh, that's just studio
publicity, I hate it.

2255
02:06:49,053 --> 02:06:52,060
Well anyway, it's only for a little while,

2256
02:06:52,060 --> 02:06:56,390
until I get some money
saved and then I'm gonna do

2257
02:06:56,390 --> 02:06:58,790
some serious roles, on the stage.

2258
02:07:00,120 --> 02:07:03,200
Don't laugh at me, but
when I was Rose in Niagara,

2259
02:07:04,398 --> 02:07:05,570
you know what I was thinking?

2260
02:07:06,650 --> 02:07:08,350
I could play Lady MacBeth someday.

2261
02:07:10,670 --> 02:07:11,503
Anyway.

2262
02:07:12,570 --> 02:07:15,190
What I'm doing, it's
not gonna last, but you,

2263
02:07:15,190 --> 02:07:19,509
well you're a champion
athlete, everybody loves you.

2264
02:07:19,509 --> 02:07:23,770
You'll last forever.

2265
02:07:23,770 --> 02:07:24,900
- Okay.

2266
02:07:24,900 --> 02:07:25,733
Yeah, I guess.

2267
02:07:27,070 --> 02:07:31,380
- Mostly I wanna settle down,
like you, like any girl.

2268
02:07:32,958 --> 02:07:34,420
Have a family.

2269
02:07:34,420 --> 02:07:37,040
I love children, I'm
just crazy about babies.

2270
02:07:38,509 --> 02:07:39,342
- I know what you mean.

2271
02:07:39,342 --> 02:07:40,175
I have a son.

2272
02:07:41,250 --> 02:07:42,083
- A little boy?

2273
02:07:43,260 --> 02:07:44,570
You do?

2274
02:07:44,570 --> 02:07:45,990
- Yeah.

2275
02:07:45,990 --> 02:07:47,760
He's 10 years old.

2276
02:07:49,014 --> 02:07:52,000
He's with my ex-wife, so
I don't get to see him

2277
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:53,963
as much as I'd like to.

2278
02:07:53,963 --> 02:07:58,963
- Oh, I always wanted a little boy.

2279
02:07:59,019 --> 02:08:04,019
Would you excuse me?

2280
02:08:15,570 --> 02:08:17,494
(crying)

2281
02:08:17,494 --> 02:08:22,494
- Miss, you all right?

2282
02:08:25,834 --> 02:08:28,251
(whispering)

2283
02:08:30,890 --> 02:08:32,340
- She left everything behind.

2284
02:08:34,470 --> 02:08:36,010
She broke the sacred trust.

2285
02:08:38,085 --> 02:08:38,918
The covenant.

2286
02:08:40,630 --> 02:08:44,230
When I heard about the
abortion, I called her.

2287
02:08:45,360 --> 02:08:47,310
She kept blaming Marilyn.

2288
02:08:47,310 --> 02:08:50,040
It wasn't Marilyn, it was her.

2289
02:08:53,444 --> 02:08:54,330
It was all Norma.

2290
02:09:08,821 --> 02:09:11,654
(car door closes)

2291
02:09:13,729 --> 02:09:15,410
- Oh, this dress is worse
than a straitjacket.

2292
02:09:15,410 --> 02:09:17,420
If I breathe the seams will pop.

2293
02:09:17,420 --> 02:09:19,344
I swear, Whitey, I'm a slave to this

2294
02:09:19,344 --> 02:09:21,506
Marilyn Monroe. (laughs)

2295
02:09:21,506 --> 02:09:23,960
- Now Miss Monroe, please don't flinch.

2296
02:09:23,960 --> 02:09:26,330
Have I ever stabbed you in the eye?

2297
02:09:26,330 --> 02:09:29,430
So, is your friend gonna
be at the premiere?

2298
02:09:29,430 --> 02:09:31,100
- No, he can't make it, he's being honored

2299
02:09:31,100 --> 02:09:33,580
at the Baseball Hall of Fame, or fishing

2300
02:09:33,580 --> 02:09:34,700
with Hemingway today, I don't know,

2301
02:09:34,700 --> 02:09:36,190
I can't keep track of it all.

2302
02:09:36,190 --> 02:09:39,660
Anyway, the PR staff are pissed. (laughs)

2303
02:09:39,660 --> 02:09:41,050
- Listen to this one.

2304
02:09:41,050 --> 02:09:44,280
Dear Miss Monroe, I'm 13 years old,

2305
02:09:44,280 --> 02:09:47,161
I think you are the most
beautiful movie star,

2306
02:09:47,161 --> 02:09:49,600
only my mother won't
let me go to your shows.

2307
02:09:49,600 --> 02:09:51,870
- I don't blame her.

2308
02:09:51,870 --> 02:09:53,190
Didi, make sure we answer all those,

2309
02:09:53,190 --> 02:09:54,450
I don't wanna miss anybody.

2310
02:09:54,450 --> 02:09:56,400
- Don't move, this is crucial.

2311
02:09:56,400 --> 02:09:59,880
I'm gonna move the beauty
mark down just a fraction.

2312
02:09:59,880 --> 02:10:00,713
- Ow!

2313
02:10:00,713 --> 02:10:02,620
- Dear Norma Jeane, this is possibly

2314
02:10:02,620 --> 02:10:05,009
the hardest letter I have ever penned.

2315
02:10:05,009 --> 02:10:06,870
I know your mother is a sick woman,

2316
02:10:06,870 --> 02:10:09,210
but she also has an evil heart.

2317
02:10:11,920 --> 02:10:13,560
She expelled me from your life.

2318
02:10:14,405 --> 02:10:17,713
I'm your father, Norma Jeane.

2319
02:10:17,713 --> 02:10:18,850
- What?

2320
02:10:18,850 --> 02:10:20,490
- Oh, it's probably some prank.

2321
02:10:20,490 --> 02:10:23,000
There's no return address, but
it was mailed in Los Angeles.

2322
02:10:23,000 --> 02:10:24,060
- I'll contact you again soon.

2323
02:10:24,060 --> 02:10:26,505
Look for me, my precious daughter upon

2324
02:10:26,505 --> 02:10:28,837
a special occasion in your life when...

2325
02:10:30,610 --> 02:10:33,680
Whitey, my father, I've
waited my whole life--

2326
02:10:33,680 --> 02:10:35,804
- Are you are, Miss Monroe?

2327
02:10:35,804 --> 02:10:36,637
- I can't.

2328
02:10:37,900 --> 02:10:40,680
Whitey, get me some
Bennies and some Nebutol.

2329
02:10:43,424 --> 02:10:48,424
(upbeat jazz music)
(people cheering)

2330
02:11:31,095 --> 02:11:33,603
- Tell our radio audience,
are you lonely tonight?

2331
02:11:33,603 --> 02:11:34,436
- Well, I--

2332
02:11:34,436 --> 02:11:36,075
- When are you and the
slugger gonna get married?

2333
02:11:36,075 --> 02:11:37,790
- As soon as I decide,
you'll be the first to know,

2334
02:11:37,790 --> 02:11:38,623
before he does.

2335
02:11:38,623 --> 02:11:40,000
- This must be very exciting for you.

2336
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:42,127
- Oh yes, my mother used to
bring me here to this theater

2337
02:11:42,127 --> 02:11:44,315
when I was a little
girl, it's very exciting.

2338
02:11:44,315 --> 02:11:45,439
- Thank you very much.

2339
02:11:45,439 --> 02:11:47,015
- Jane.

2340
02:11:47,015 --> 02:11:49,870
(mumbling)

2341
02:11:49,870 --> 02:11:50,790
- Strip?

2342
02:11:50,790 --> 02:11:51,790
- No baby, the kiss.

2343
02:11:52,822 --> 02:11:54,104
(laughing)

2344
02:11:54,104 --> 02:11:56,722
- We've arranged for you to
stay in the imperial suite.

2345
02:11:56,722 --> 02:11:58,480
(mumbling)

2346
02:11:58,480 --> 02:12:00,720
Now be sure to go alone.

2347
02:12:00,720 --> 02:12:02,320
Someone special will be waiting.

2348
02:12:06,066 --> 02:12:07,066
- My father?

2349
02:12:08,091 --> 02:12:09,677
(laughs)

2350
02:12:09,677 --> 02:12:12,558
Champagne and Benzodrine.

2351
02:12:12,558 --> 02:12:15,430
The warm fizzing of my
blood, the happiness

2352
02:12:15,430 --> 02:12:19,110
pounding in my heart,
someone special will be

2353
02:12:19,110 --> 02:12:21,275
waiting for you.

2354
02:12:21,275 --> 02:12:25,513
It was like a happy ending
to a long, confusing movie.

2355
02:12:27,160 --> 02:12:28,740
I wanted to tell Cass.

2356
02:12:29,690 --> 02:12:31,460
If only I could tell Cass.

2357
02:12:33,275 --> 02:12:36,275
(light piano music)

2358
02:13:24,988 --> 02:13:25,821
- Daddy.

2359
02:13:28,050 --> 02:13:28,883
- Marilyn.

2360
02:13:31,480 --> 02:13:33,640
I'm sorry, I'd hoped I'd
make it to the premiere,

2361
02:13:33,640 --> 02:13:36,178
but I couldn't get a flight in time.

2362
02:13:36,178 --> 02:13:38,000
(laughs)

2363
02:13:38,000 --> 02:13:40,397
- Gosh, golly, I... (laughs)

2364
02:13:41,549 --> 02:13:42,960
Yeah, this is--

2365
02:13:42,960 --> 02:13:45,887
- Listen to me.
- Mm. (laughs)

2366
02:13:45,887 --> 02:13:47,539
- I wanna take care of you.

2367
02:13:47,539 --> 02:13:49,910
I wanna protect you from all the jackals.

2368
02:13:49,910 --> 02:13:54,077
We love each other, I think
it's time to get married.

2369
02:13:54,077 --> 02:13:59,077
- Married?

2370
02:14:04,171 --> 02:14:05,584
- Do you like it?

2371
02:14:05,584 --> 02:14:09,375
- Yes, darling, yes, yes, yes.

2372
02:14:09,375 --> 02:14:12,262
Oh, your hands, your strong, strong,

2373
02:14:12,262 --> 02:14:15,532
your beautiful hands, you see now,

2374
02:14:15,532 --> 02:14:20,532
now my life is perfect, it is.

2375
02:14:22,436 --> 02:14:25,519
(reporters shouting)

2376
02:14:30,740 --> 02:14:32,941
- I just wanna say this
is the happiest day

2377
02:14:32,941 --> 02:14:34,519
of my whole life.

2378
02:14:34,519 --> 02:14:38,036
(reporters shouting)

2379
02:14:38,036 --> 02:14:40,953
(light jazz music)

2380
02:14:49,785 --> 02:14:52,859
- I gotta be heard, scumbag.

2381
02:14:52,859 --> 02:14:57,859
- Hey, with the right kind of
attitude, I'm on your side.

2382
02:14:57,916 --> 02:15:00,540
I admire you, always have.

2383
02:15:01,730 --> 02:15:02,930
Hey, I'm a Yankees fan.

2384
02:15:04,450 --> 02:15:05,840
Admire your lady too.

2385
02:15:07,030 --> 02:15:09,290
Real high class lady.

2386
02:15:12,310 --> 02:15:17,310
It's just I feel strongly
that these old negatives

2387
02:15:18,250 --> 02:15:19,800
should be taken off the market.

2388
02:15:21,740 --> 02:15:25,080
So they can't be misappropriated.

2389
02:15:34,105 --> 02:15:35,240
Thanks, slugger.

2390
02:15:36,810 --> 02:15:41,425
You did the right thing.

2391
02:15:41,425 --> 02:15:43,508
(grunts)

2392
02:15:46,294 --> 02:15:49,127
(tires squealing)

2393
02:15:54,138 --> 02:15:56,971
(car door closes)

2394
02:16:02,615 --> 02:16:04,198
- [Norma Jeane] Hi.

2395
02:16:06,194 --> 02:16:07,545
- Don't you ever pick anything up?

2396
02:16:07,545 --> 02:16:09,520
- I don't know how it got this way,

2397
02:16:09,520 --> 02:16:11,440
I've been sick, I guess.

2398
02:16:11,440 --> 02:16:12,400
Oh!

2399
02:16:12,400 --> 02:16:13,233
God!

2400
02:16:15,140 --> 02:16:16,460
- Is that what you are?

2401
02:16:16,460 --> 02:16:17,293
Meat?

2402
02:16:17,293 --> 02:16:18,580
- No Daddy, I don't wanna be.

2403
02:16:19,500 --> 02:16:20,500
- Look at this mess.

2404
02:16:21,340 --> 02:16:22,900
Look at it.

2405
02:16:22,900 --> 02:16:25,605
The tissues all covered with makeup?

2406
02:16:25,605 --> 02:16:29,190
(Norma Jeane squeals)

2407
02:16:29,190 --> 02:16:30,450
You never put a lid on anything.

2408
02:16:30,450 --> 02:16:32,299
You even forget to flush the toilet!

2409
02:16:32,299 --> 02:16:34,382
(crying)

2410
02:16:36,079 --> 02:16:39,200
These people are exploiting
you, can't you see that?

2411
02:16:40,110 --> 02:16:42,320
They make millions, they pay
you peanuts on that contract.

2412
02:16:42,320 --> 02:16:44,610
You tell them no, this new movie, no deal.

2413
02:16:44,610 --> 02:16:46,610
- No Daddy, I have to
work, I have to work,

2414
02:16:46,610 --> 02:16:48,230
it's my life, I have to work.

2415
02:16:48,230 --> 02:16:49,300
- No.

2416
02:16:49,300 --> 02:16:50,710
You tell them you're quitting.

2417
02:16:50,710 --> 02:16:52,490
Your husband says you're quitting!

2418
02:16:52,490 --> 02:16:54,573
(crying)

2419
02:17:02,537 --> 02:17:03,537
Look at you.

2420
02:17:04,629 --> 02:17:06,560
I can't stand to see you cheapen yourself.

2421
02:17:08,545 --> 02:17:10,840
God, I'm sorry I hit you.

2422
02:17:12,470 --> 02:17:13,630
I never wanna hurt you.

2423
02:17:13,630 --> 02:17:15,470
- I know, Daddy, I know.

2424
02:17:15,470 --> 02:17:16,303
I know.

2425
02:17:17,220 --> 02:17:19,570
It's so scary, isn't it?

2426
02:17:21,140 --> 02:17:24,740
How scenes with actual people,
they just go on and on,

2427
02:17:24,740 --> 02:17:27,090
and what's to stop them?

2428
02:17:28,810 --> 02:17:31,150
Nobody yells "cut."

2429
02:17:33,122 --> 02:17:35,205
(crying)

2430
02:17:36,074 --> 02:17:38,650
- She meant more to me
than she meant to herself.

2431
02:17:38,650 --> 02:17:39,600
I can see that now.

2432
02:17:41,870 --> 02:17:42,703
She loved me.

2433
02:17:44,760 --> 02:17:45,760
I know that now too.

2434
02:17:47,250 --> 02:17:50,210
But we hurt each other
like wounded animals.

2435
02:17:52,320 --> 02:17:56,970
After she died, I had
roses sent to her crypt,

2436
02:17:56,970 --> 02:17:59,310
three times a week, for 20 years.

2437
02:18:04,622 --> 02:18:08,282
- Good of you to come to the
funeral, I appreciate it.

2438
02:18:08,282 --> 02:18:11,000
- Your father, he was
always so kind to me,

2439
02:18:11,000 --> 02:18:13,790
your whole family, taking me in.

2440
02:18:13,790 --> 02:18:15,080
- [Man] Taking you in?

2441
02:18:15,080 --> 02:18:17,050
You worked for every penny.

2442
02:18:17,050 --> 02:18:20,000
You ran our house, our family.

2443
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:20,833
You were family.

2444
02:18:23,044 --> 02:18:25,430
Mother tells me you have
children of your own now.

2445
02:18:25,430 --> 02:18:26,930
- Four.

2446
02:18:26,930 --> 02:18:30,840
Three daughters, and
the oldest one, a son.

2447
02:18:31,874 --> 02:18:32,707
- A son.

2448
02:18:34,740 --> 02:18:38,600
I missed out, no children, yet.

2449
02:18:40,779 --> 02:18:42,620
I hope you're happy, Magda.

2450
02:18:43,890 --> 02:18:44,723
- [Norma Jeane] Happy?

2451
02:18:46,714 --> 02:18:47,764
- [Man] Your husband?

2452
02:18:50,390 --> 02:18:55,187
- My husband, is a good man.

2453
02:18:56,583 --> 02:18:58,290
- [Man] Oh Magda.

2454
02:18:58,290 --> 02:19:00,430
- Isaac, it's all right.

2455
02:19:01,795 --> 02:19:04,934
No more words.

2456
02:19:04,934 --> 02:19:07,990
Mr. Straussberg, excuse me,
can I do it again please,

2457
02:19:07,990 --> 02:19:09,890
'cause I know I can do it better.

2458
02:19:10,994 --> 02:19:11,827
Just...

2459
02:19:17,300 --> 02:19:18,133
- Sure.

2460
02:19:23,469 --> 02:19:24,969
- [Man] Uh-oh, oh.

2461
02:19:25,901 --> 02:19:28,818
(people murmuring)

2462
02:19:36,259 --> 02:19:37,259
- [Strassberg] Stay.

2463
02:19:38,620 --> 02:19:40,300
You'll see, she's not bad.

2464
02:19:40,300 --> 02:19:41,890
- You cast her without telling me.

2465
02:19:41,890 --> 02:19:43,980
- I told you on the phone.

2466
02:19:43,980 --> 02:19:46,750
- You didn't say her name,
you didn't say Hollywood.

2467
02:19:46,750 --> 02:19:48,670
- She's through with Hollywood.

2468
02:19:48,670 --> 02:19:50,390
They're suing her, the studio.

2469
02:19:50,390 --> 02:19:52,030
I called her agent.

2470
02:19:52,030 --> 02:19:56,000
She owes them four or five movies.

2471
02:19:56,000 --> 02:20:00,340
Suspended without pay and
hasn't anything saved.

2472
02:20:00,340 --> 02:20:01,173
Look.

2473
02:20:02,440 --> 02:20:04,940
She walked into my office a few weeks ago,

2474
02:20:04,940 --> 02:20:07,100
getting over a painful divorce.

2475
02:20:07,100 --> 02:20:10,400
She said she was ready
to learn real acting.

2476
02:20:10,400 --> 02:20:12,390
- Don't give me that crap, Lee.

2477
02:20:12,390 --> 02:20:14,420
It's very obvious what's going on.

2478
02:20:14,420 --> 02:20:16,520
You've fallen in love with a movie star.

2479
02:20:16,520 --> 02:20:17,353
You bastard.

2480
02:20:19,190 --> 02:20:21,110
(upbeat jazz music)

2481
02:20:21,110 --> 02:20:25,193
(people laughing and chattering)

2482
02:20:35,841 --> 02:20:39,161
- [Norma Jeane] I'm so
honored that I could read

2483
02:20:39,161 --> 02:20:41,418
for the part of Magda, I was terrified.

2484
02:20:41,418 --> 02:20:43,521
I thought you'd take one look at me

2485
02:20:43,521 --> 02:20:46,040
and speak to Mr. Straussberg
and I'd be out of the cast.

2486
02:20:46,040 --> 02:20:47,930
- Are you sure that's
all you're gonna drink?

2487
02:20:49,340 --> 02:20:50,850
- Oh, yes.

2488
02:20:50,850 --> 02:20:53,615
Water, I drink water. (laughs)

2489
02:20:53,615 --> 02:20:57,072
See, my only clear thought was

2490
02:20:57,072 --> 02:21:02,072
that if I fail, well, it's
winter here, freezing,

2491
02:21:03,950 --> 02:21:06,030
it wouldn't be hard to die, would it?

2492
02:21:07,810 --> 02:21:08,890
- Yes.

2493
02:21:08,890 --> 02:21:10,900
Well, about my play.

2494
02:21:13,160 --> 02:21:17,380
Magda is from a world
where people do freeze

2495
02:21:18,322 --> 02:21:20,331
during the winter.

2496
02:21:20,331 --> 02:21:22,990
She's a farm girl from Poland, a survivor.

2497
02:21:24,555 --> 02:21:28,270
I'm not sure that she
adds up for the audience.

2498
02:21:29,516 --> 02:21:33,240
- I have some ideas about Magda.

2499
02:21:33,240 --> 02:21:34,730
I mean, if you're interested.

2500
02:21:36,022 --> 02:21:37,372
- Of course I'm interested.

2501
02:21:38,570 --> 02:21:41,030
- This girl Magda, she's like the girl

2502
02:21:41,030 --> 02:21:43,450
in Chekhov's Three
Sisters, you know the girl

2503
02:21:43,450 --> 02:21:46,510
who marries the brother and
she has the sash on her dress

2504
02:21:46,510 --> 02:21:49,830
that isn't the right
color, only with Magda

2505
02:21:49,830 --> 02:21:52,060
it's the way she speaks English.

2506
02:21:52,060 --> 02:21:54,340
- Did Mr. Straussberg tell you this?

2507
02:21:54,340 --> 02:21:59,140
- No, no, I read the play
myself years ago. (laughs)

2508
02:21:59,140 --> 02:22:00,890
I always thought I could play Natasha.

2509
02:22:00,890 --> 02:22:03,280
I mean, someone like
me could play Natasha,

2510
02:22:03,280 --> 02:22:06,450
'cause well, she doesn't
belong in a good family,

2511
02:22:06,450 --> 02:22:10,130
and people laugh at her. (laughs)

2512
02:22:10,130 --> 02:22:13,610
See, but then Chekhov, well
he surprises you because

2513
02:22:15,028 --> 02:22:17,930
Natasha, who has her sympathy,

2514
02:22:17,930 --> 02:22:21,627
but she turns out to be so
selfish, so devious, really bad.

2515
02:22:24,660 --> 02:22:27,430
- You're saying I made Magda too good.

2516
02:22:27,430 --> 02:22:28,940
- No.

2517
02:22:28,940 --> 02:22:31,641
I guess, (laughs)

2518
02:22:31,641 --> 02:22:33,451
I guess I said the wrong thing.

2519
02:22:33,451 --> 02:22:34,550
- No, no.

2520
02:22:36,158 --> 02:22:38,090
Writers are strange characters.

2521
02:22:42,260 --> 02:22:46,880
There was a Magda in my
life, and I did love her,

2522
02:22:46,880 --> 02:22:47,730
when I was young.

2523
02:22:49,430 --> 02:22:51,910
Look, I wrote the play a long time ago,

2524
02:22:51,910 --> 02:22:56,910
it's too sentimental, but
there's something in it.

2525
02:23:00,705 --> 02:23:01,538
- Like Chekhov?

2526
02:23:04,680 --> 02:23:06,630
- I'm afraid I'm not much like Chekhov.

2527
02:23:08,085 --> 02:23:10,168
(laughs)

2528
02:23:11,373 --> 02:23:13,353
- What revered in Magda is, well,

2529
02:23:15,220 --> 02:23:17,800
she had her baby because she loved it.

2530
02:23:17,800 --> 02:23:20,920
I mean, before it was
even born she loved it.

2531
02:23:20,920 --> 02:23:22,540
Isaac didn't know, nobody knew,

2532
02:23:22,540 --> 02:23:27,540
but she finds a man to marry
her so her baby could be born.

2533
02:23:29,720 --> 02:23:30,630
I'm sorry, it's...

2534
02:23:33,460 --> 02:23:35,860
- We don't have to talk
about the play, Marilyn.

2535
02:23:38,118 --> 02:23:39,560
I should call you Marilyn, shouldn't I?

2536
02:23:39,560 --> 02:23:41,230
Or is that a stage name?

2537
02:23:42,700 --> 02:23:45,910
- Well, you could call me
Norma, that's my real name.

2538
02:23:45,910 --> 02:23:47,560
- Somehow Norma doesn't suit you.

2539
02:23:48,420 --> 02:23:49,253
- It doesn't?

2540
02:23:50,590 --> 02:23:54,300
Norma Jeane is what my
mother called me, actually.

2541
02:23:54,300 --> 02:23:57,810
My mother, and my
father, it doesn't matter

2542
02:23:57,810 --> 02:23:59,240
what you call me, you could whistle.

2543
02:24:00,744 --> 02:24:03,093
(laughing)

2544
02:24:03,093 --> 02:24:05,260
You could call me Hey You.

2545
02:24:07,872 --> 02:24:08,705
- Hey you.

2546
02:24:10,751 --> 02:24:11,584
- Hey you.

2547
02:24:15,866 --> 02:24:18,283
(horn honks)

2548
02:24:27,441 --> 02:24:29,540
You are different.

2549
02:24:29,540 --> 02:24:34,457
Other men just see a body,
they're just attracted sexually.

2550
02:24:36,054 --> 02:24:39,721
- You're a lovely woman,
that's not a debit.

2551
02:24:44,116 --> 02:24:46,366
Maybe I'm not so different.

2552
02:24:49,447 --> 02:24:51,500
Do you know I wanna hold you?

2553
02:24:51,500 --> 02:24:56,490
I've always been faithful to my wife.

2554
02:24:57,997 --> 02:25:00,000
I do not take my marriage casually.

2555
02:25:01,340 --> 02:25:05,150
I have two children, a family.

2556
02:25:05,150 --> 02:25:09,144
- Oh gosh, I understand.

2557
02:25:09,144 --> 02:25:11,114
I guess, I'm sorry.

2558
02:25:11,114 --> 02:25:14,031
(light jazz music)

2559
02:25:29,640 --> 02:25:31,940
- I didn't want to love this woman.

2560
02:25:31,940 --> 02:25:34,430
A Hollywood actress.

2561
02:25:34,430 --> 02:25:35,780
I had heard all the rumors.

2562
02:25:37,499 --> 02:25:40,690
When I met her, I didn't
believe any of them.

2563
02:25:40,690 --> 02:25:42,160
- Hi, it's me.

2564
02:25:42,160 --> 02:25:42,993
Your Magda.

2565
02:25:44,110 --> 02:25:45,080
- Hey you.

2566
02:25:45,080 --> 02:25:45,980
- I had the power.

2567
02:25:47,300 --> 02:25:49,320
I would rewrite her story.

2568
02:25:49,320 --> 02:25:51,000
- I went to this tram bookshop today,

2569
02:25:51,000 --> 02:25:52,520
I bought those out of print plays of yours

2570
02:25:52,520 --> 02:25:54,800
that I hadn't read yet.

2571
02:25:54,800 --> 02:25:58,950
Your wonderful work, I admire you so much.

2572
02:25:58,950 --> 02:25:59,850
- I wanna see you.

2573
02:26:00,782 --> 02:26:04,050
I just don't want to involve
you in all my problems.

2574
02:26:04,050 --> 02:26:07,060
- [Woman] Anybody home?

2575
02:26:07,060 --> 02:26:09,400
- I'm on the phone, I'll be right there.

2576
02:26:09,400 --> 02:26:11,780
- I wanted to be a great actress for him,

2577
02:26:11,780 --> 02:26:12,980
to make him proud of me.

2578
02:26:13,940 --> 02:26:14,930
God I loved him.

2579
02:26:16,093 --> 02:26:19,200
I was so deeply in love,
I wanted to die sometimes.

2580
02:26:20,710 --> 02:26:24,610
No, no, I wanted to live.

2581
02:26:24,610 --> 02:26:28,510
Just to live, and know
that he was living too.

2582
02:26:30,096 --> 02:26:32,660
Before you I wasn't anyone.

2583
02:26:32,660 --> 02:26:33,700
I wasn't even born.

2584
02:26:35,494 --> 02:26:39,440
There were other men, but you'll never

2585
02:26:39,440 --> 02:26:41,120
write about me, will you?

2586
02:26:41,120 --> 02:26:41,953
About us?

2587
02:26:42,820 --> 02:26:45,847
When maybe you don't love me anymore?

2588
02:26:45,847 --> 02:26:47,184
- I'll always love you.

2589
02:26:47,184 --> 02:26:48,930
- But you're a writer.

2590
02:26:48,930 --> 02:26:52,676
First you see and then you write.

2591
02:26:52,676 --> 02:26:55,980
I mean, if we broke up.

2592
02:26:55,980 --> 02:26:59,250
- We won't break up.

2593
02:26:59,250 --> 02:27:03,473
- Other men, well that was
Marilyn Monroe, that wasn't me.

2594
02:27:04,400 --> 02:27:06,900
Most men I don't even feel
anything, but with you.

2595
02:27:08,000 --> 02:27:10,010
- I wish I didn't have to go to Tucson.

2596
02:27:10,010 --> 02:27:12,250
It just feels so far away.

2597
02:27:12,250 --> 02:27:13,620
- I know.

2598
02:27:13,620 --> 02:27:16,052
But we need money for your divorce.

2599
02:27:16,052 --> 02:27:16,952
I'm gonna convert.

2600
02:27:18,009 --> 02:27:21,021
I'm gonna un-baptize my
faith and become a Jew.

2601
02:27:21,021 --> 02:27:21,893
(both laugh)

2602
02:27:21,893 --> 02:27:22,993
In my soul I'm Jewish.

2603
02:27:24,760 --> 02:27:28,476
Let him kiss me with
the kisses of his mouth,

2604
02:27:28,476 --> 02:27:33,476
for thy love is better than wine.

2605
02:27:43,761 --> 02:27:46,608
(horns honking)
(reporters shouting)

2606
02:27:46,608 --> 02:27:49,525
(cameras flashing)

2607
02:27:53,610 --> 02:27:55,560
- Miss Monroe, this is your
first visit to England.

2608
02:27:55,560 --> 02:27:56,720
What are your impressions?

2609
02:27:56,720 --> 02:27:59,610
- Well you're my first
impressions, and you seem friendly.

2610
02:27:59,610 --> 02:28:01,180
- How does it feel to be married?

2611
02:28:01,180 --> 02:28:03,290
- Wonderful, now my life is perfect.

2612
02:28:03,290 --> 02:28:04,950
- Are you excited about
working with Laurence Olivier?

2613
02:28:04,950 --> 02:28:07,150
- Well actually, I'm a little scared.

2614
02:28:07,150 --> 02:28:08,997
- If you'll excuse us, please.

2615
02:28:08,997 --> 02:28:12,080
(reporters shouting)

2616
02:28:15,881 --> 02:28:17,540
- Do we have an estimate as to when

2617
02:28:17,540 --> 02:28:21,640
Miss Monroe will be ready?

2618
02:28:22,529 --> 02:28:23,430
(sighs)

2619
02:28:23,430 --> 02:28:24,780
Well, it's been five hours.

2620
02:28:25,760 --> 02:28:27,710
We only had one day with her last week.

2621
02:28:33,406 --> 02:28:35,060
Ah, here she is.

2622
02:28:38,820 --> 02:28:39,653
The lead actress.

2623
02:28:39,653 --> 02:28:42,540
- I'm sorry if I've kept you all waiting.

2624
02:28:42,540 --> 02:28:45,010
- Oh, you are worth waiting for, darling.

2625
02:28:45,010 --> 02:28:46,650
So, let's get on with it.

2626
02:28:46,650 --> 02:28:50,400
The lighting's all set, you
hurriedly take your place

2627
02:28:50,400 --> 02:28:55,400
at the end of the line here
to curtsy to the archduke, me.

2628
02:28:55,740 --> 02:28:59,100
- Can I speak with you for a moment?

2629
02:28:59,100 --> 02:29:02,470
See, the showgirl doesn't dance.

2630
02:29:04,150 --> 02:29:04,983
Why?

2631
02:29:04,983 --> 02:29:06,660
- Well, it isn't in the script.

2632
02:29:06,660 --> 02:29:08,060
- Why?

2633
02:29:08,060 --> 02:29:09,970
- It wasn't in the play.

2634
02:29:09,970 --> 02:29:12,070
Well it's too late now anyway,
it would cost too much.

2635
02:29:12,070 --> 02:29:15,550
It would take you forever to
perform those scenes, Marilyn.

2636
02:29:15,550 --> 02:29:16,530
Just learn your lines.

2637
02:29:16,530 --> 02:29:17,620
- But I don't like this.

2638
02:29:17,620 --> 02:29:20,220
I don't like that my strap
breaks when I curtsy.

2639
02:29:20,220 --> 02:29:22,790
See, I think it's cheap
and it's Vaudeville,

2640
02:29:22,790 --> 02:29:24,620
and it's the Marx brothers, and I don't--

2641
02:29:24,620 --> 02:29:26,170
- Darling, it's comedy.

2642
02:29:27,460 --> 02:29:28,293
- But--

2643
02:29:28,293 --> 02:29:29,980
- Marylin, my dear.

2644
02:29:31,500 --> 02:29:32,960
Just act sexy.

2645
02:29:49,630 --> 02:29:50,463
- Darling?

2646
02:29:52,331 --> 02:29:53,350
Darling?

2647
02:29:57,428 --> 02:29:58,450
(knocking)

2648
02:29:58,450 --> 02:30:00,300
Darling, what are you doing in there?

2649
02:30:01,340 --> 02:30:02,610
Huh?

2650
02:30:02,610 --> 02:30:03,950
- I'm sick.
- What?

2651
02:30:03,950 --> 02:30:06,153
- Olivier's making me sick.

2652
02:30:06,153 --> 02:30:07,650
He put a curse on me.

2653
02:30:07,650 --> 02:30:10,330
- Oh, no, darling, don't think that way.

2654
02:30:10,330 --> 02:30:11,570
He admires you.

2655
02:30:11,570 --> 02:30:13,090
- No.

2656
02:30:13,090 --> 02:30:15,660
No, no, no, when he touches
me, his skin crawls.

2657
02:30:15,660 --> 02:30:17,640
It's like his nostrils, do I smell?

2658
02:30:17,640 --> 02:30:18,473
Do I smell?

2659
02:30:18,473 --> 02:30:19,970
Because I don't understand,
it's like the hate me,

2660
02:30:19,970 --> 02:30:21,570
I mean they look at me, and
their eyes or something,

2661
02:30:21,570 --> 02:30:23,120
they hate me, they hate me.

2662
02:30:23,120 --> 02:30:24,010
I can't, I can't--

2663
02:30:24,010 --> 02:30:25,830
- Norma, Norma, that's not true.

2664
02:30:25,830 --> 02:30:26,663
That's not true.

2665
02:30:26,663 --> 02:30:28,160
Now listen to me, listen
to me, listen to me.

2666
02:30:28,160 --> 02:30:30,450
There is a car that's downstairs

2667
02:30:30,450 --> 02:30:33,210
and it's been waiting for
you for over an hour, okay?

2668
02:30:33,210 --> 02:30:34,043
- I'm sick.

2669
02:30:34,043 --> 02:30:35,876
- Now you gotta get up, yes, get up

2670
02:30:35,876 --> 02:30:39,340
and get in the shower, and we'll do this.

2671
02:30:39,340 --> 02:30:40,310
- I don't wanna go!

2672
02:30:41,507 --> 02:30:43,301
- Norma, god, you're frightening me,

2673
02:30:43,301 --> 02:30:44,934
I mean, this is serious.

2674
02:30:44,934 --> 02:30:46,610
Come on, people are you counting on you.

2675
02:30:46,610 --> 02:30:47,990
Please don't do this to yourself.

2676
02:30:47,990 --> 02:30:49,680
- You admire him, you admire him, you do.

2677
02:30:49,680 --> 02:30:50,630
You're on his side.

2678
02:30:51,716 --> 02:30:53,602
(crying)

2679
02:30:53,602 --> 02:30:55,044
- Okay.

2680
02:30:55,044 --> 02:30:56,094
I'll show you admire.

2681
02:30:57,590 --> 02:30:58,860
Look.

2682
02:30:58,860 --> 02:31:00,050
You smuggled these.

2683
02:31:00,050 --> 02:31:02,000
You smuggled these on the
plane and you promised me.

2684
02:31:02,000 --> 02:31:03,450
You promised me!

2685
02:31:03,450 --> 02:31:06,660
- Why don't you just let me
die, that's what you all want!

2686
02:31:06,660 --> 02:31:08,560
- Please, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, just please,

2687
02:31:08,560 --> 02:31:09,680
why do you think like this?

2688
02:31:09,680 --> 02:31:11,510
Why are you doing this?

2689
02:31:11,510 --> 02:31:15,730
- 'Cause you never once defended
me against that bastard.

2690
02:31:15,730 --> 02:31:17,910
You never once defended me.

2691
02:31:20,560 --> 02:31:23,260
- I was just trying to be fair.

2692
02:31:23,260 --> 02:31:25,010
I wasn't sure who was in the wrong.

2693
02:31:28,210 --> 02:31:30,920
- He despises Marilyn.

2694
02:31:34,410 --> 02:31:35,243
- No.

2695
02:31:36,390 --> 02:31:37,590
No, you despise Marilyn.

2696
02:31:44,820 --> 02:31:46,422
- Forgive me baby.

2697
02:31:46,422 --> 02:31:47,637
Oh, forgive me.

2698
02:31:47,637 --> 02:31:51,100
Forgive me.

2699
02:31:51,100 --> 02:31:51,933
I want you baby.

2700
02:31:51,933 --> 02:31:53,830
I'm so proud of you.

2701
02:31:53,830 --> 02:31:55,350
- It was a nightmare.

2702
02:31:55,350 --> 02:31:56,510
Why did I marry her?

2703
02:31:56,510 --> 02:31:59,690
Why did I think I was strong enough?

2704
02:32:00,800 --> 02:32:02,482
I had to save her.

2705
02:32:02,482 --> 02:32:05,480
Get her away from the
expectations of others,

2706
02:32:05,480 --> 02:32:08,510
away from England when
the movie was finished.

2707
02:32:08,510 --> 02:32:11,650
I had to take her to a safe place,

2708
02:32:11,650 --> 02:32:14,250
a place in Maine where I'd
been with my former wife.

2709
02:32:16,070 --> 02:32:20,270
I had to return Norma to life.

2710
02:32:20,270 --> 02:32:22,670
- Oh Daddy, thank you,
this is the happiest day

2711
02:32:22,670 --> 02:32:24,369
in my whole life, give me your hand.

2712
02:32:24,369 --> 02:32:26,870
Can you feel the heartbeat? (laughs)

2713
02:32:26,870 --> 02:32:28,520
- Yes.

2714
02:32:28,520 --> 02:32:31,190
- Oh god, he's in there
sleeping, dreaming,

2715
02:32:31,190 --> 02:32:33,200
two months and and six days in the world.

2716
02:32:33,200 --> 02:32:35,180
I want baby to be born
here where it's peaceful,

2717
02:32:35,180 --> 02:32:36,170
with a midwife.

2718
02:32:36,170 --> 02:32:37,768
- Midwife?
(Norma Jeane laughs)

2719
02:32:37,768 --> 02:32:39,776
- Oh, I don't wanna die
in a hospital, Daddy.

2720
02:32:39,776 --> 02:32:41,810
Oh, don't ever make me go back,

2721
02:32:41,810 --> 02:32:43,840
I don't wanna be her ever again.

2722
02:32:43,840 --> 02:32:46,574
I escaped with my life but just barely.

2723
02:32:46,574 --> 02:32:48,410
(screams)

2724
02:32:48,410 --> 02:32:49,243
Come on!

2725
02:32:51,568 --> 02:32:53,818
(laughing)

2726
02:32:54,808 --> 02:32:56,530
- I already told you, my
wife is not interested

2727
02:32:56,530 --> 02:32:58,420
in movies at this present time.

2728
02:32:58,420 --> 02:33:00,590
- [Man On Phone] Some Like It
Hot's a very special project.

2729
02:33:00,590 --> 02:33:02,760
They've written it especially for Marilyn.

2730
02:33:02,760 --> 02:33:04,660
They're offering a minimum of 100,000.

2731
02:33:05,600 --> 02:33:07,460
- We appreciate the offer, but my wife

2732
02:33:07,460 --> 02:33:10,430
is expecting our baby in December.

2733
02:33:10,430 --> 02:33:11,280
I can't talk now.

2734
02:33:12,448 --> 02:33:15,552
(phone hangs up)

2735
02:33:15,552 --> 02:33:18,135
(gulls cawing)

2736
02:33:26,580 --> 02:33:29,840
- Daddy, I'm sorry, honest,
but it was so exciting,

2737
02:33:29,840 --> 02:33:32,190
I got this letter when I
went to the post office

2738
02:33:32,190 --> 02:33:34,890
from my father, and I just
went to that little cafe,

2739
02:33:34,890 --> 02:33:37,480
you know, and I just sat there
and I read it over and over

2740
02:33:37,480 --> 02:33:39,481
and I watched the birds and the waves,

2741
02:33:39,481 --> 02:33:41,320
and the ice cream melted in my car

2742
02:33:41,320 --> 02:33:42,350
'cause I left all the groceries--

2743
02:33:42,350 --> 02:33:43,183
- Who's Cass?

2744
02:33:44,130 --> 02:33:45,340
- What?

2745
02:33:45,340 --> 02:33:47,150
- It was in one of your books.

2746
02:33:47,150 --> 02:33:50,140
The Actor's Handbook and the Actor's Life.

2747
02:33:50,140 --> 02:33:51,697
There was an inscription.

2748
02:33:51,697 --> 02:33:52,530
- Oh.

2749
02:33:52,530 --> 02:33:55,950
Cass, well, that was a long time ago.

2750
02:33:55,950 --> 02:33:57,230
- I'd just like to know, you know,

2751
02:33:57,230 --> 02:34:00,560
how long were you with
him, this Cass person?

2752
02:34:00,560 --> 02:34:02,240
- With him?
- Yeah.

2753
02:34:02,240 --> 02:34:04,820
- We palled around, Daddy, I don't know,

2754
02:34:04,820 --> 02:34:06,980
I'm not an adding machine,
please don't start.

2755
02:34:06,980 --> 02:34:08,480
- What do you expect?

2756
02:34:08,480 --> 02:34:10,070
I've been waiting for you all day.

2757
02:34:10,070 --> 02:34:12,230
Just been half crazy with worry.

2758
02:34:13,103 --> 02:34:15,802
Is that blood on your pants?

2759
02:34:15,802 --> 02:34:17,288
On your pants.

2760
02:34:17,288 --> 02:34:18,550
Are you miscarrying?

2761
02:34:18,550 --> 02:34:19,550
- Oh gosh. (laughs)

2762
02:34:19,550 --> 02:34:22,300
Daddy, it's raspberries,
I was eating raspberries,

2763
02:34:22,300 --> 02:34:23,890
I guess I made a pig of myself,

2764
02:34:23,890 --> 02:34:25,950
please don't be so suspicious.

2765
02:34:28,140 --> 02:34:30,560
- I just want you to understand.

2766
02:34:30,560 --> 02:34:33,010
I just, I've been worried.

2767
02:34:33,010 --> 02:34:36,080
I don't know where you are,
or what you've been doing.

2768
02:34:36,080 --> 02:34:38,380
- What would I be doing, hmm?

2769
02:34:38,380 --> 02:34:40,990
Okay, don't look so sad, just don't.

2770
02:34:40,990 --> 02:34:42,530
Here, taste.

2771
02:34:42,530 --> 02:34:43,363
Taste.

2772
02:34:43,363 --> 02:34:44,980
They're delicious.

2773
02:34:44,980 --> 02:34:47,160
Don't you wanna see my letter?

2774
02:34:47,160 --> 02:34:49,070
He says how much he loves me.

2775
02:34:49,070 --> 02:34:50,180
- It could be a cruel prank.

2776
02:34:50,180 --> 02:34:51,180
- No.

2777
02:34:51,180 --> 02:34:53,152
It's my father, I know it is.

2778
02:34:53,152 --> 02:34:55,452
And he's gonna make
contact with me in person.

2779
02:34:57,100 --> 02:35:00,017
(light jazz music)

2780
02:35:01,780 --> 02:35:03,235
Daddy.

2781
02:35:03,235 --> 02:35:04,485
Daddy, wake up.

2782
02:35:05,828 --> 02:35:07,221
Daddy.

2783
02:35:07,221 --> 02:35:08,452
- Oh, Norma.

2784
02:35:08,452 --> 02:35:10,250
- No Daddy, there's
something in the cellar,

2785
02:35:10,250 --> 02:35:13,500
I can hear a baby crying in the cellar.

2786
02:35:13,500 --> 02:35:15,540
I can hear it, I can, can't you hear it?

2787
02:35:18,380 --> 02:35:19,213
- You're having a nightmare.

2788
02:35:19,213 --> 02:35:20,620
- No, I wasn't asleep.

2789
02:35:20,620 --> 02:35:23,230
I can hear it, there's
something trapped down there,

2790
02:35:23,230 --> 02:35:24,380
please, can you just...

2791
02:35:34,487 --> 02:35:37,237
(water dripping)

2792
02:35:39,668 --> 02:35:42,772
- [Playwright] There's
nothing down here, Norma.

2793
02:35:42,772 --> 02:35:43,910
- Oh Daddy.

2794
02:35:43,910 --> 02:35:46,210
Guess you have to humor
a pregnant woman, huh?

2795
02:35:51,679 --> 02:35:54,340
You don't think I'm crazy, do you?

2796
02:35:54,340 --> 02:35:58,060
Oh Daddy, please don't write about me.

2797
02:35:58,060 --> 02:36:00,964
- Let's go to bed.

2798
02:36:00,964 --> 02:36:03,464
(cats mewing)

2799
02:36:06,740 --> 02:36:09,060
Maybe you should stop feeding these cats.

2800
02:36:10,506 --> 02:36:13,520
- I don't want 'em to die.

2801
02:36:15,048 --> 02:36:17,750
- Well more and more'll
just keep showing up.

2802
02:36:17,750 --> 02:36:19,280
Can't feed the entire state.

2803
02:36:19,280 --> 02:36:20,910
- I know Daddy, you're right.

2804
02:36:22,080 --> 02:36:23,140
- [Playwright] You gonna
be okay on your own here

2805
02:36:23,140 --> 02:36:24,634
for a few hours?

2806
02:36:24,634 --> 02:36:25,467
- Of course.

2807
02:36:25,467 --> 02:36:26,370
Yeah.

2808
02:36:26,370 --> 02:36:28,053
I'm gonna write my mother,
I thought I might ask her

2809
02:36:28,053 --> 02:36:29,493
to come visit us.

2810
02:36:29,493 --> 02:36:30,585
- That would be lovely.

2811
02:36:30,585 --> 02:36:33,755
I'd like to meet her.

2812
02:36:33,755 --> 02:36:34,619
See you.

2813
02:36:34,619 --> 02:36:37,768
(bell rings)

2814
02:36:37,768 --> 02:36:39,328
(typewriter clacking)

2815
02:36:39,328 --> 02:36:43,544
- Dear Mother. (typewriter dings)

2816
02:36:43,544 --> 02:36:45,130
I have heard from my father.

2817
02:36:51,975 --> 02:36:54,495
I've heard from my father.

2818
02:36:54,495 --> 02:36:57,245
Someday, someday when the baby's,

2819
02:36:58,680 --> 02:37:02,960
someday when baby is...

2820
02:37:12,941 --> 02:37:17,055
David can't bear that any
man might look upon her

2821
02:37:17,055 --> 02:37:20,570
without desire, she can't bear looking

2822
02:37:22,610 --> 02:37:27,533
the mirror and see the lines in her face.

2823
02:37:29,280 --> 02:37:31,740
He's writing about me.

2824
02:37:33,975 --> 02:37:38,975
Oh my god.

2825
02:37:39,164 --> 02:37:42,560
- Norma!

2826
02:37:45,947 --> 02:37:47,040
Norma!

2827
02:37:55,210 --> 02:37:56,043
Norma?

2828
02:38:02,638 --> 02:38:03,780
Norma?

2829
02:38:03,780 --> 02:38:05,310
Oh my god, what happened?

2830
02:38:06,707 --> 02:38:07,847
(crying)

2831
02:38:07,847 --> 02:38:10,291
- The baby, the baby.

2832
02:38:10,291 --> 02:38:11,124
Daddy.

2833
02:38:12,571 --> 02:38:13,404
My baby.

2834
02:38:14,440 --> 02:38:17,023
(somber music)

2835
02:38:24,337 --> 02:38:25,587
You lied to me.

2836
02:38:26,929 --> 02:38:30,037
Said you'd never write about me.

2837
02:38:30,037 --> 02:38:32,301
- What are you talking about?

2838
02:38:32,301 --> 02:38:34,718
- Character in your new play.

2839
02:38:36,263 --> 02:38:39,605
- Darling, Ava is nothing like you.

2840
02:38:39,605 --> 02:38:41,290
She's a woman in her 50s.

2841
02:38:43,177 --> 02:38:44,800
I love you, darling.

2842
02:38:44,800 --> 02:38:46,130
I love you.

2843
02:38:46,130 --> 02:38:48,490
I would never, ever do
anything to hurt you.

2844
02:38:50,660 --> 02:38:53,930
Listen to me, Norma, listen to me.

2845
02:38:53,930 --> 02:38:54,763
Listen to me.

2846
02:38:57,761 --> 02:38:59,880
The baby, we won't give up.

2847
02:39:01,556 --> 02:39:04,760
We won't, we'll try again,
and again, and again.

2848
02:39:07,077 --> 02:39:07,994
- Oh Daddy.

2849
02:39:10,573 --> 02:39:13,810
Why not just tell the truth for once?

2850
02:39:15,180 --> 02:39:16,013
Please.

2851
02:39:19,114 --> 02:39:21,197
(crying)

2852
02:39:36,900 --> 02:39:37,733
- Marilyn.

2853
02:39:44,899 --> 02:39:47,199
How happy we are to have
you back on the team.

2854
02:39:48,170 --> 02:39:49,070
- It was the cats.

2855
02:39:50,370 --> 02:39:51,770
The cats that I was feeding.

2856
02:39:53,020 --> 02:39:54,970
They're the ones that wanted baby dead.

2857
02:39:56,770 --> 02:39:57,603
- Marilyn?

2858
02:40:00,554 --> 02:40:02,554
- They were in the cellar making noises.

2859
02:40:04,937 --> 02:40:06,860
Trying to get me to come down the stairs.

2860
02:40:09,374 --> 02:40:10,477
It's all clear now.

2861
02:40:12,990 --> 02:40:14,140
Everything's all clear.

2862
02:40:21,480 --> 02:40:23,030
- Just hold still, Miss Monroe.

2863
02:40:24,204 --> 02:40:26,154
This should get you through the dinner.

2864
02:40:28,115 --> 02:40:28,990
It might be good to have your husband here

2865
02:40:28,990 --> 02:40:30,040
while you're working.

2866
02:40:31,610 --> 02:40:32,443
- Miss Monroe?

2867
02:40:33,290 --> 02:40:35,730
There's someone here to see you.

2868
02:40:35,730 --> 02:40:37,830
He says it's important, an Eddie G?

2869
02:40:38,900 --> 02:40:40,250
I think he's been drinking.

2870
02:40:45,635 --> 02:40:46,468
- Hi.

2871
02:40:52,255 --> 02:40:55,255
- How did you know where to find me?

2872
02:40:56,710 --> 02:40:58,410
- There's no secrets in Hollywood.

2873
02:41:00,670 --> 02:41:02,920
Norma, something terrible
has happened today.

2874
02:41:05,150 --> 02:41:05,983
Cass died.

2875
02:41:07,880 --> 02:41:09,170
- Cass?

2876
02:41:09,170 --> 02:41:11,020
- An alchy death, not a junkie death.

2877
02:41:12,110 --> 02:41:13,890
He was up in the Tapinka Canyon.

2878
02:41:16,970 --> 02:41:18,470
He left a memento for you.

2879
02:41:18,470 --> 02:41:19,730
- No.

2880
02:41:19,730 --> 02:41:20,816
- No what?

2881
02:41:20,816 --> 02:41:22,720
- I don't want it.

2882
02:41:22,720 --> 02:41:23,553
I don't want it.

2883
02:41:33,702 --> 02:41:34,535
A tiger.

2884
02:41:35,534 --> 02:41:36,584
The one for the baby.

2885
02:41:37,422 --> 02:41:41,920
Why?

2886
02:41:45,150 --> 02:41:48,933
To MM, in her life, your tearful father.

2887
02:41:52,470 --> 02:41:55,600
Cass was the one who wrote the
letters from my father, Cass?

2888
02:41:55,600 --> 02:41:56,990
You know, you never wanted this baby,

2889
02:41:56,990 --> 02:41:59,250
Cass never wanted this
baby, don't pretend,

2890
02:41:59,250 --> 02:42:01,550
no, don't pretend, you stay away from me!

2891
02:42:01,550 --> 02:42:03,190
- Norma--
- Stay away from me.

2892
02:42:06,663 --> 02:42:11,663
(people chattering)
(carnival music)

2893
02:42:16,991 --> 02:42:19,319
(Norma Jeane laughs)

2894
02:42:19,319 --> 02:42:22,859
- Your little girl is so
pretty, she's so pretty.

2895
02:42:22,859 --> 02:42:25,950
Do you wanna ride the
Ferris wheel, can she?

2896
02:42:25,950 --> 02:42:27,261
- Can I?

2897
02:42:27,261 --> 02:42:28,764
- Come on.

2898
02:42:28,764 --> 02:42:30,071
Come on.

2899
02:42:30,071 --> 02:42:32,738
(both laughing)

2900
02:42:36,775 --> 02:42:37,855
Take us up.

2901
02:42:37,855 --> 02:42:39,084
Wanna go up?

2902
02:42:39,084 --> 02:42:40,164
(Norma laughing)

2903
02:42:40,164 --> 02:42:42,747
(girl squeals)

2904
02:42:44,291 --> 02:42:47,004
Isn't this fun?
- This is fun!

2905
02:42:47,004 --> 02:42:49,921
(light jazz music)

2906
02:42:54,549 --> 02:42:56,799
(laughing)

2907
02:42:58,553 --> 02:43:00,720
(screams)

2908
02:43:02,617 --> 02:43:07,016
We're flying across the
ocean to China, like birds.

2909
02:43:07,016 --> 02:43:09,266
(laughing)

2910
02:43:11,317 --> 02:43:13,150
Oh, so pretty up here.

2911
02:43:15,129 --> 02:43:20,129
Do you know that I'm
Marilyn Monroe? (laughing)

2912
02:43:33,410 --> 02:43:34,277
This is fun.

2913
02:43:35,416 --> 02:43:38,562
No no no, wait.

2914
02:43:38,562 --> 02:43:40,806
Do me a favor, darling.

2915
02:43:40,806 --> 02:43:42,925
Keep it forever, okay?

2916
02:43:42,925 --> 02:43:44,018
Okay?

2917
02:43:44,018 --> 02:43:48,932
Okay.

2918
02:43:48,932 --> 02:43:51,574
- [Girl] Look what she gave me!

2919
02:43:51,574 --> 02:43:54,824
(talking indistinctly)

2920
02:44:25,346 --> 02:44:28,092
(waves crashing)

2921
02:44:28,092 --> 02:44:30,675
(gulls cawing)

2922
02:45:10,904 --> 02:45:14,372
- I dreamt last night that I
was pregnant with his baby.

2923
02:45:14,372 --> 02:45:15,205
(laughs)

2924
02:45:15,205 --> 02:45:17,120
- You mean the president's?

2925
02:45:17,120 --> 02:45:18,500
- It's just a dream.

2926
02:45:18,500 --> 02:45:20,390
I'm never gonna be a mother.

2927
02:45:20,390 --> 02:45:23,990
'Cause when your number
is up, it's up. (laughs)

2928
02:45:23,990 --> 02:45:27,480
Now, he is a man who knows how to make

2929
02:45:27,480 --> 02:45:29,190
a woman feel like a true woman.

2930
02:45:31,770 --> 02:45:35,830
Even with his bad back. (laughs)

2931
02:45:35,830 --> 02:45:38,160
You know what I said to
him after we were finished?

2932
02:45:38,160 --> 02:45:43,160
I said, "if I was Castro,
I'd be real afraid of you."

2933
02:45:43,560 --> 02:45:45,390
(laughing)

2934
02:45:45,390 --> 02:45:47,622
- You wanna be careful, Miss Monroe.

2935
02:45:47,622 --> 02:45:49,140
- I know he can't leave her.

2936
02:45:50,140 --> 02:45:50,973
His wife.

2937
02:45:52,060 --> 02:45:53,260
Even though he loves me.

2938
02:45:54,360 --> 02:45:57,890
Catholics, everything. (scoffs and laughs)

2939
02:45:57,890 --> 02:45:59,230
- That isn't what I meant.

2940
02:45:59,230 --> 02:46:01,210
All of this, could be dangerous.

2941
02:46:01,210 --> 02:46:02,410
- Yeah.

2942
02:46:02,410 --> 02:46:04,330
All those little social security men

2943
02:46:04,330 --> 02:46:07,540
listening to our phone calls. (laughs)

2944
02:46:07,540 --> 02:46:09,845
- Don't you mean secret service men?

2945
02:46:09,845 --> 02:46:11,010
- Oh.

2946
02:46:11,010 --> 02:46:13,180
I better not make any wrong moves.

2947
02:46:13,180 --> 02:46:17,550
They might draw their guns
and shoot me. (laughs)

2948
02:46:19,874 --> 02:46:21,644
I'm nervous.

2949
02:46:21,644 --> 02:46:24,727
(somber piano music)

2950
02:46:46,740 --> 02:46:48,060
Takes longer and longer.

2951
02:46:49,340 --> 02:46:52,522
Maybe I should refuse to appear. (laughs)

2952
02:46:52,522 --> 02:46:57,135
Oh god, the studio's gonna
fire me, and I'm almost broke.

2953
02:46:57,135 --> 02:46:59,270
- No, no, Miss Monroe.

2954
02:46:59,270 --> 02:47:00,870
They would never do that.

2955
02:47:00,870 --> 02:47:03,620
This is for the president,
the honor of a lifetime.

2956
02:47:04,831 --> 02:47:05,664
- Honor.

2957
02:47:05,664 --> 02:47:09,280
They said they'd pay for all my expenses,

2958
02:47:09,280 --> 02:47:14,179
the dress and the plane and
everything, so here I am.

2959
02:47:14,179 --> 02:47:15,387
(laughs)

2960
02:47:15,387 --> 02:47:18,071
The president's wind-up sex toy.

2961
02:47:18,071 --> 02:47:20,515
(laughs)

2962
02:47:20,515 --> 02:47:21,348
Hang on a sec.

2963
02:47:25,860 --> 02:47:27,250
Okay.

2964
02:47:27,250 --> 02:47:28,583
Okay.

2965
02:47:28,583 --> 02:47:31,227
(laughs)

2966
02:47:31,227 --> 02:47:34,310
(somber piano music)

2967
02:47:36,501 --> 02:47:38,695
(knocking on door)

2968
02:47:38,695 --> 02:47:40,599
- [Man] Miss Monroe, how much longer?

2969
02:47:40,599 --> 02:47:42,350
We can't keep the
audience waiting forever.

2970
02:47:42,350 --> 02:47:44,060
- Minutes, just a few minutes.

2971
02:47:44,060 --> 02:47:46,040
We're working, we're working.

2972
02:47:46,040 --> 02:47:47,530
- What if I forget the words?

2973
02:47:48,650 --> 02:47:51,447
- You can't forget the
words to Happy Birthday.

2974
02:47:51,447 --> 02:47:52,975
(laughs)

2975
02:47:52,975 --> 02:47:54,830
- He thinks I'm so funny.

2976
02:47:54,830 --> 02:47:58,250
I told him I write my own
lines, you know what he said?

2977
02:47:58,250 --> 02:48:03,207
He said, "Marilyn, you have
the nicest lines in show biz."

2978
02:48:03,207 --> 02:48:05,457
(laughing)

2979
02:48:06,730 --> 02:48:10,630
- She's coming, she's
coming, she's almost here.

2980
02:48:11,888 --> 02:48:13,190
Almost.

2981
02:48:17,529 --> 02:48:18,742
Marilyn.

2982
02:48:18,742 --> 02:48:20,992
(laughing)

2983
02:48:22,379 --> 02:48:24,596
(sighs)

2984
02:48:24,596 --> 02:48:28,687
- Oh gosh, I thought I was
dead, just for a second there.

2985
02:48:30,131 --> 02:48:34,347
Promise me something.

2986
02:48:34,347 --> 02:48:39,347
After I'm gone, (laughs)

2987
02:48:40,088 --> 02:48:44,859
you'll make Marilyn up one final time.

2988
02:48:44,859 --> 02:48:49,407
- Miss Monroe, I will.

2989
02:48:49,407 --> 02:48:52,448
Now go out there and knock his socks off.

2990
02:48:52,448 --> 02:48:55,707
- Okay.

2991
02:48:55,707 --> 02:48:57,235
- Don't let me hear anybody say

2992
02:48:57,235 --> 02:48:59,911
anything against Miss Monroe.

2993
02:48:59,911 --> 02:49:04,911
I'll shove their teeth down their throats.

2994
02:49:05,171 --> 02:49:09,060
She was the only one
of them that was human.

2995
02:49:09,060 --> 02:49:13,310
(audience cheering and applauding)

2996
02:49:20,887 --> 02:49:23,220
(whistling)

2997
02:49:27,714 --> 02:49:29,797
(laughs)

2998
02:49:32,519 --> 02:49:35,602
(somber piano music)

2999
02:50:08,919 --> 02:50:12,002
