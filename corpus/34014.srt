1
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:05,826
Snuggle in, sweetie! It's cold out there.

2
00:03:10,704 --> 00:03:14,071
Why is it snowing, Grandma?
Where does it come from?

3
00:03:14,641 --> 00:03:17,075
Oh, that's a long story, sweetheart.

4
00:03:18,011 --> 00:03:21,242
- I wanna hear.
- Not tonight. Go to sleep.

5
00:03:21,915 --> 00:03:25,248
I'm not sleepy. Tell me, please.

6
00:03:25,719 --> 00:03:27,812
Well, all right.

7
00:03:28,889 --> 00:03:30,948
Let's see...

8
00:03:31,525 --> 00:03:35,325
I guess it would have to start with scissors!

9
00:03:35,428 --> 00:03:37,487
Scissors?

10
00:03:37,564 --> 00:03:41,261
Well, there are all kinds of scissors.

11
00:03:42,302 --> 00:03:47,137
And once there was even a man
who had scissors for hands.

12
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,174
- A man?
- Yes.

13
00:03:49,276 --> 00:03:52,973
- Hands scissors?
- No, scissor hands.

14
00:03:54,281 --> 00:03:58,843
You know the mansion
on top of the mountain?

15
00:03:59,386 --> 00:04:01,047
It's haunted.

16
00:04:01,154 --> 00:04:03,247
Well...

17
00:04:03,857 --> 00:04:05,916
A long time ago

18
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:10,122
an inventor lived in that mansion.

19
00:04:11,665 --> 00:04:14,395
He made many things, I suppose.

20
00:04:20,473 --> 00:04:22,532
He also created a man.

21
00:04:24,277 --> 00:04:30,216
He gave him insides,
a heart, a brain, everything.

22
00:04:31,384 --> 00:04:33,477
Well, almost everything.

23
00:04:35,889 --> 00:04:39,757
You see, the inventor was very old.

24
00:04:39,826 --> 00:04:43,353
He died before he got to finish
the man he invented.

25
00:04:44,798 --> 00:04:47,596
So the man was left by himself,

26
00:04:48,368 --> 00:04:51,769
incomplete and all alone.

27
00:04:53,406 --> 00:04:55,499
He didn't have a name?

28
00:04:56,209 --> 00:04:58,302
Of course he had a name.

29
00:04:59,045 --> 00:05:01,172
His name was Edward.

30
00:05:47,694 --> 00:05:49,491
Avon calling!

31
00:05:49,562 --> 00:05:52,895
- Weren't you just here?
- No, not since last season!

32
00:05:53,466 --> 00:05:58,403
Today I've come to show you our ex quisite
new line of softer colors, in shadows,

33
00:05:58,505 --> 00:06:00,268
blushes, and lipstick.

34
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:04,003
Everything you need to accent and highlight
your changing look.

35
00:06:04,144 --> 00:06:07,477
My changing look. That's good!

36
00:06:07,547 --> 00:06:11,005
I also have a complete selection
of your old favorites,

37
00:06:11,151 --> 00:06:15,554
those tried and true products we've all
come to depend on year in and year out.

38
00:06:15,622 --> 00:06:18,216
Come on, Peg,
I never buy anything from you.

39
00:06:18,325 --> 00:06:20,418
I know. Bye, Helen.

40
00:06:21,528 --> 00:06:25,692
You didn't have to call me, ma'am.
You could have taken care of this by yourself.

41
00:06:25,765 --> 00:06:27,824
I could? I don't think so.

42
00:06:27,934 --> 00:06:30,732
It's easy. Your food trap's clogged, that's all.

43
00:06:30,804 --> 00:06:33,295
See this bolt here? You just unscrew this...

44
00:06:35,041 --> 00:06:36,804
And out she pops.

45
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:39,435
On TV they say you repairmen
are a lonely bunch.

46
00:06:39,546 --> 00:06:44,313
Housewives get lonely too, though you may
not realize it since they haven't made an ad.

47
00:06:44,384 --> 00:06:50,323
And then you just take this and put it back in
here nice and easy. Be careful not to force it.

48
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:52,620
And then you just screw this back on.

49
00:06:53,927 --> 00:06:56,395
Now who could that be?

50
00:06:56,463 --> 00:06:58,556
Will you ex cuse me for a moment?

51
00:06:59,265 --> 00:07:03,395
Don't go anywhere. I'll be right back.
This is fascinatin'!

52
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:05,870
I wouldn't wanna miss a moment of it!

53
00:07:10,577 --> 00:07:13,774
- Good morning, Joyce. Avon calling!
- Why, Peg...

54
00:07:13,847 --> 00:07:17,044
Have you gone blind?
Can't you see that vehicle in my drive?

55
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:23,417
- Yes.
- Don't you realize that means I'm busy?

56
00:07:25,191 --> 00:07:27,682
OK, now we should decide on lipsticks.

57
00:07:27,794 --> 00:07:32,458
OK, dear, did you like the Winsome Wahini,
which looked charming on you,

58
00:07:32,565 --> 00:07:34,965
or the Bahimini Bliss?

59
00:07:35,034 --> 00:07:37,093
- I like 'em both.
- Well, great!

60
00:07:38,238 --> 00:07:41,401
You don't actually think
I have any money, do you?

61
00:07:53,653 --> 00:07:57,054
Ding-dong! The Avon lady!

62
00:08:00,093 --> 00:08:01,993
Just not my day.

63
00:09:58,845 --> 00:10:00,938
Oh, my goodness!

64
00:10:20,133 --> 00:10:22,624
Oh, it's so beautiful!

65
00:10:44,457 --> 00:10:46,550
Hello?

66
00:11:13,386 --> 00:11:15,445
Hello?

67
00:11:22,996 --> 00:11:25,726
Hello? Avon calling!

68
00:12:00,967 --> 00:12:03,060
Oh, my!

69
00:12:05,638 --> 00:12:07,697
Hello?

70
00:12:12,245 --> 00:12:17,706
I'm Peg Boggs.
I'm your local Avon representative.

71
00:12:29,328 --> 00:12:34,129
I'm sorry to barge in like this,
but you don't have any reason to be afraid.

72
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:37,328
This is some huge house, isn't it?

73
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:41,167
Thank goodness
for those aerobics classes.

74
00:13:36,129 --> 00:13:38,620
Hello?

75
00:13:39,665 --> 00:13:41,997
Why are you hiding back there?

76
00:13:45,438 --> 00:13:48,737
You don't have to hide from me.
I'm Peg Boggs.

77
00:13:48,808 --> 00:13:51,208
I'm your local Avon representative,

78
00:13:51,277 --> 00:13:54,371
and I'm as harmless as cherry pie...

79
00:13:54,447 --> 00:13:55,812
Oh, my!

80
00:13:55,882 --> 00:13:58,407
I can see that I've disturbed you.

81
00:13:58,551 --> 00:14:00,746
How stupid of me. I'll just be going now.

82
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:02,879
Don't go.

83
00:14:09,195 --> 00:14:11,254
Oh, my!

84
00:14:12,231 --> 00:14:14,256
What happened to you?

85
00:14:14,367 --> 00:14:16,392
I'm not finished.

86
00:14:16,469 --> 00:14:19,097
Put those down.
Don't come any closer. Please...

87
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:28,972
Those are your hands?

88
00:14:36,322 --> 00:14:38,415
What happened to you?

89
00:14:40,893 --> 00:14:42,986
Where are your parents?

90
00:14:43,896 --> 00:14:45,989
Your mother?

91
00:14:47,033 --> 00:14:49,297
Your father?

92
00:14:49,936 --> 00:14:51,631
He didn't wake up.

93
00:14:56,209 --> 00:15:00,111
Are you alone?
Do you live up here all by yourself?

94
00:15:04,283 --> 00:15:06,342
What happened to your face?

95
00:15:10,056 --> 00:15:12,490
I won't hurt you.

96
00:15:13,726 --> 00:15:17,321
At the very least,
let me give you a good astringent.

97
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:19,864
This will help to prevent infection.

98
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:33,369
What's your name?

99
00:15:33,746 --> 00:15:35,839
Edward.

100
00:15:41,287 --> 00:15:43,915
I think you should just come home with me.

101
00:15:58,938 --> 00:16:01,338
- I'm sorry.
- No, don't be.

102
00:16:01,908 --> 00:16:05,742
You go ahead and look.
You have every reason to be ex cited.

103
00:16:11,083 --> 00:16:13,142
You OK?

104
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:46,044
Hello?

105
00:16:46,152 --> 00:16:47,779
Hi. It's Marge.

106
00:16:47,853 --> 00:16:52,790
I was standing outside talking to Carol, and
Peg drove by. She had somebody with her.

107
00:16:52,858 --> 00:16:55,588
- Did you get a good look at him?
- No, I didn't.

108
00:16:55,728 --> 00:16:58,322
Did she say anything to you
about having a guest?

109
00:16:58,397 --> 00:17:01,764
Nothing at all.
She rang my doorbell at the crack of dawn.

110
00:17:01,834 --> 00:17:04,803
No... OK, I'll meet you on the corner.

111
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:06,963
Right. Bye.

112
00:17:11,610 --> 00:17:12,770
Damn!

113
00:17:25,491 --> 00:17:27,618
Here we go, dear. This is our house.

114
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:31,355
You can just go right in
and make yourself right at home, OK?

115
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:34,797
We'll have something to eat or drink, or...

116
00:17:34,867 --> 00:17:39,770
Here, dear. Here we go. This is the front door.
Right in here.

117
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:44,105
Joyce? I just saw this strange guy
drive in with Peg. I didn't get a good look.

118
00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:46,041
He looked kinda pale.

119
00:17:46,112 --> 00:17:48,410
On my way. Don't do anything without me.

120
00:17:48,481 --> 00:17:50,574
Yes! Be right there!

121
00:17:56,455 --> 00:17:58,514
Here we are.

122
00:18:17,009 --> 00:18:21,742
So... this is the living room
and back here are the bedrooms.

123
00:18:21,847 --> 00:18:24,338
You want to see the pictures? All right.

124
00:18:25,484 --> 00:18:29,921
This is my husband Bill.
He's a bowling champion.

125
00:18:30,022 --> 00:18:32,320
Do you know what bowling is?

126
00:18:32,425 --> 00:18:34,256
Bowling?

127
00:18:34,326 --> 00:18:37,261
No. Well... Here they are
down at the lake, fishing.

128
00:18:37,329 --> 00:18:42,460
I think Kevin looks a little glum
because they didn't catch anything that day.

129
00:18:43,335 --> 00:18:47,032
And here's my daughter Kim.

130
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,699
All dressed for the junior prom.

131
00:18:58,084 --> 00:19:00,678
She's a senior now, if you can believe it!

132
00:19:01,454 --> 00:19:04,321
She's camping in the mountains
with friends,

133
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:07,325
but she'll be back in a few days.
You can meet then.

134
00:19:16,735 --> 00:19:18,862
Isn't she beautiful?

135
00:19:26,679 --> 00:19:28,738
That's my family.

136
00:19:29,582 --> 00:19:32,346
Come along.
I'll show you the rest of the house.

137
00:19:32,418 --> 00:19:35,285
Then you can just freshen up
and make yourself at home.

138
00:19:35,354 --> 00:19:39,290
That's the kitchen over there.
Help yourself to anything you want.

139
00:19:39,358 --> 00:19:42,885
Those are grapes.
And back here are the bedrooms.

140
00:19:42,962 --> 00:19:46,830
Let me get you some towels
and I'll see what we can find for you to wear.

141
00:19:46,932 --> 00:19:52,029
You know what? I think I have some of
Bill's old clothes in here. This is perfect!

142
00:19:52,972 --> 00:19:55,031
Here. These should just fit you.

143
00:19:56,408 --> 00:19:58,740
Don't be alarmed. That's just the phone.

144
00:19:58,844 --> 00:20:03,304
Now you can go in Kim's room
and put these on, and I'll be right with you.

145
00:21:48,921 --> 00:21:52,152
No, no, scissors!

146
00:21:52,258 --> 00:21:56,319
That's right. Well, he was
born up there or... something.

147
00:21:56,428 --> 00:22:00,421
- Have you seen him before?
- No, I doubt he's ever been off the grounds.

148
00:22:00,499 --> 00:22:03,297
Then how did you ever get together with him?

149
00:22:03,369 --> 00:22:07,499
Listen, I have to go now.
I'll talk to you later, Marge. Bye-bye.

150
00:22:17,516 --> 00:22:19,575
Sorry, Edward, I didn't...

151
00:22:20,586 --> 00:22:22,520
May I help you with this?

152
00:22:22,588 --> 00:22:24,681
Thank you.

153
00:22:27,359 --> 00:22:30,954
There you go. Oh dear, you've cut your face.

154
00:22:31,063 --> 00:22:32,997
Let me just get this right off.

155
00:22:33,098 --> 00:22:35,089
- Does that hurt?
- No.

156
00:22:35,167 --> 00:22:37,567
Good. OK. Now, let's get you dressed.

157
00:22:41,473 --> 00:22:44,567
There we go. Very fine!

158
00:22:49,148 --> 00:22:51,207
You look fine!

159
00:22:56,422 --> 00:22:59,152
Helen, come on! She wouldn't wait for you.

160
00:23:00,092 --> 00:23:02,151
I've got rollers in my damn hair!

161
00:23:22,381 --> 00:23:25,441
Now, what did I do with my sciss...?

162
00:23:26,518 --> 00:23:29,009
Edward, would you?

163
00:23:30,656 --> 00:23:32,317
Thank you.

164
00:23:32,925 --> 00:23:36,452
You know, I have a doctor friend
who I think could help you.

165
00:23:36,962 --> 00:23:39,055
- Really?
- Yes.

166
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:42,125
Now, I can help with the scars...

167
00:23:45,204 --> 00:23:49,766
But I just wanna consult the big
Avon handbook before doing anything.

168
00:24:34,253 --> 00:24:36,312
Kevin!

169
00:24:40,659 --> 00:24:42,718
It's not polite to stare, dear.

170
00:24:45,497 --> 00:24:49,627
Think how it would make you feel
if somebody were staring at you.

171
00:24:49,735 --> 00:24:53,865
- I wouldn't care.
- Well, I would, so don't do it!

172
00:24:53,939 --> 00:24:57,500
This must be quite a change
for you, right, Ed?

173
00:24:57,609 --> 00:25:01,010
- Edward, dear. I think he prefers Edward.
- Sure.

174
00:25:01,747 --> 00:25:06,446
So what have you been doin' with yourself
up there in that big old place?

175
00:25:06,518 --> 00:25:10,284
- I bet the view must be spectacular, huh, Ed?
- Edward!

176
00:25:10,923 --> 00:25:11,947
Yes?

177
00:25:13,358 --> 00:25:15,656
No, I just...

178
00:25:15,727 --> 00:25:18,560
See all the way to the ocean, I bet.

179
00:25:18,664 --> 00:25:20,495
Sometimes.

180
00:25:22,067 --> 00:25:25,127
Bill, could I have the salt and pepper, please?

181
00:25:26,772 --> 00:25:31,072
Bill, dear, could I have
the salt and pepper, please? Thank you.

182
00:25:49,695 --> 00:25:51,754
Man, those things are cool!

183
00:25:52,297 --> 00:25:55,789
I bet they're razor-sharp.
One karate chop to a guy's neck...

184
00:25:55,901 --> 00:25:57,368
Kevin...!

185
00:26:00,873 --> 00:26:02,340
Edward,

186
00:26:02,808 --> 00:26:05,709
would you like some butter for your bread?

187
00:26:10,315 --> 00:26:11,942
Great!

188
00:26:12,384 --> 00:26:14,477
Thank you.

189
00:26:16,889 --> 00:26:19,551
Hey, can I bring him to
show and tell on Monday?

190
00:26:19,625 --> 00:26:21,684
Kevin, I've had enough.

191
00:26:26,498 --> 00:26:28,523
Do you think you can sleep?

192
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:32,001
I know things feel strange,
but soon you'll feel right at home.

193
00:26:32,905 --> 00:26:34,964
Good night.

194
00:27:36,301 --> 00:27:39,270
The light concealing cream goes on first,

195
00:27:39,771 --> 00:27:42,001
then you blend and blend and blend.

196
00:27:42,074 --> 00:27:44,042
Blending is the secret.

197
00:27:46,912 --> 00:27:48,675
More concealing cream...

198
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:51,408
Your complexion is so fair!

199
00:27:51,483 --> 00:27:54,008
Now, this has a touch of lavender in it.

200
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,820
Give it a try here.

201
00:27:56,888 --> 00:27:59,186
Close enough!

202
00:27:59,291 --> 00:28:01,782
OK, this should do the trick here.

203
00:28:07,933 --> 00:28:10,026
I have another idea.

204
00:28:10,836 --> 00:28:15,273
We'll cover up the scars
and start with a completely smooth surface.

205
00:28:29,087 --> 00:28:31,146
Darn this stuff!

206
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:44,734
They still have 11 on the scoreboard,
and it's three to one.

207
00:28:47,239 --> 00:28:49,036
It's through the gap to Warren.

208
00:28:53,145 --> 00:28:55,079
Now they change it to 12 hits.

209
00:28:55,147 --> 00:28:57,342
Turn it up, Kevin, I can't hear it!

210
00:29:00,152 --> 00:29:01,915
Kevin!

211
00:29:03,989 --> 00:29:06,753
- It's hammered!
- Did you hear that, Mr Boggs?

212
00:29:06,858 --> 00:29:09,190
- No, make it louder!
- It's gone,

213
00:29:09,327 --> 00:29:11,386
it's out of here, it's history!

214
00:29:16,802 --> 00:29:18,360
Dad...

215
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:20,131
Look!

216
00:29:20,205 --> 00:29:23,538
..to make it a five-run inning
and blow this game to pieces!

217
00:29:23,608 --> 00:29:25,473
I'll be darned.

218
00:29:41,593 --> 00:29:43,424
They filled the whole tape!

219
00:29:43,528 --> 00:29:46,588
What's going on over there, Peg? Call me.

220
00:29:46,698 --> 00:29:49,792
Hi, it's Marge. Who is he? Call me.

221
00:29:49,901 --> 00:29:54,304
Oh, by the way, I hear it's pouring rain in
the mountains. Do you think the kids are OK?

222
00:29:54,406 --> 00:29:59,241
Hey there, darlin'! The gals are all in a tizzy
about your secret visitor.

223
00:29:59,377 --> 00:30:01,902
You can't keep him a secret forever!

224
00:30:15,994 --> 00:30:21,227
Well, it's just wonderful, Ed. My God,
you have the whole family in there, don't ya?

225
00:30:21,333 --> 00:30:25,429
And he answers the challenge at first
with a strike of his own.

226
00:30:26,838 --> 00:30:28,931
Edward, come here.

227
00:30:36,848 --> 00:30:39,078
No, that's a terrible idea, son!

228
00:30:39,184 --> 00:30:43,052
Go to the garage and get the oilcan.
We don't want him rusting up on us.

229
00:30:50,629 --> 00:30:52,961
Edward, you did us!

230
00:30:53,632 --> 00:30:55,964
- Oh, Bill, it's us!
- Yes, it is.

231
00:30:59,304 --> 00:31:04,003
It's not heaven he's from,
it's straight from the stinking flames of hell.

232
00:31:04,075 --> 00:31:06,635
The power of Satan is in him, I can feel it.

233
00:31:06,711 --> 00:31:10,169
- Can't you? Have you sheep strayed so far?
- We're not sheep.

234
00:31:10,248 --> 00:31:12,307
Don't come near me.

235
00:31:15,921 --> 00:31:19,049
That's right. Go on, get outta here, run!

236
00:31:19,124 --> 00:31:21,524
Edward, don't you listen to her!

237
00:31:21,626 --> 00:31:25,995
Don't worry about her, Edward.
She's just a little loony, that's all.

238
00:31:31,803 --> 00:31:33,236
Hi!

239
00:31:33,305 --> 00:31:36,240
You-all are hidin' in there like hermit crabs.

240
00:31:36,308 --> 00:31:38,139
Hi, Joyce.

241
00:31:38,243 --> 00:31:41,303
Shame on you,
keepin' your unusual guest to yourself.

242
00:31:41,413 --> 00:31:43,711
We think that's mighty selfish of you.

243
00:31:43,815 --> 00:31:45,476
Things have been hectic here.

244
00:31:45,550 --> 00:31:48,644
That is so sweet of you
to wanna correct the situation.

245
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,620
What time does the barbecue begin?

246
00:31:50,689 --> 00:31:52,122
Barbecue?

247
00:31:52,224 --> 00:31:55,091
You intend to introduce
your guest to your friends,

248
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:57,253
- don't you?
- I'll bring coleslaw.

249
00:31:59,164 --> 00:32:01,655
And I will bring the ambrosia salad!

250
00:32:02,634 --> 00:32:05,535
What time was it that you said?

251
00:32:05,637 --> 00:32:07,696
- Bill!
- About five?

252
00:32:09,274 --> 00:32:11,640
He has been sent first to tempt you!

253
00:32:12,344 --> 00:32:17,714
But it's not too late.
You must push him from you, expel him.

254
00:32:17,782 --> 00:32:20,250
Trample down the perversion of nature.

255
00:32:20,785 --> 00:32:24,084
Did you hear that?
He's a perversion of nature.

256
00:32:24,155 --> 00:32:26,146
Why, isn't that ex citin'?

257
00:32:30,195 --> 00:32:32,288
- Bye-bye.
- Thanks so much.

258
00:32:35,901 --> 00:32:37,960
Bill!

259
00:32:40,805 --> 00:32:44,673
You really can't have a picnic or a barbecue
without deviled eggs.

260
00:32:44,743 --> 00:32:47,940
They're just the best. They make a thing.

261
00:32:48,013 --> 00:32:52,814
Oh, Edward, that's wonderful!
I didn't know you'd chopped the whole thing.

262
00:32:55,086 --> 00:32:57,213
All right now, it's just a nick.

263
00:32:57,322 --> 00:33:00,018
There's no need to be nervous, dear.

264
00:33:00,125 --> 00:33:05,620
Esmeralda won't be here. And the rest of
the neighbors, they're really very nice.

265
00:33:05,730 --> 00:33:09,097
There's no need to be nervous.
They're so eager to meet you!

266
00:33:09,167 --> 00:33:10,998
You just have to be yourself.

267
00:33:11,102 --> 00:33:14,731
- Myself?
- That's right. Just your own sweet self.

268
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:44,714
- Thanks, Edward.
- Hey! Play scissors, paper, stone with us.

269
00:35:44,789 --> 00:35:46,984
Play scissors what?

270
00:35:47,092 --> 00:35:49,959
I got a doctor friend
might be able to help you.

271
00:35:50,862 --> 00:35:54,923
- He did them just like that!
- That is incredible.

272
00:35:54,999 --> 00:35:57,524
- Hi, Mike, how you doin'?
- Hello, Jack.

273
00:35:58,303 --> 00:36:00,066
Hey, kids!

274
00:36:00,138 --> 00:36:04,336
Hi, George Monroe. That's a heck of
a handshake you got there, Ed.

275
00:36:04,409 --> 00:36:07,469
Harry! I saw you
on the golf course last week...

276
00:36:10,115 --> 00:36:13,710
Are you OK? Do you want something to eat?
Are you hungry?

277
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:16,778
Do you want a cracker?

278
00:36:16,888 --> 00:36:19,322
- He's different.
- Completely different.

279
00:36:19,390 --> 00:36:21,221
No kidding.

280
00:36:21,326 --> 00:36:23,385
- He's so...
- Mysterious.

281
00:36:24,963 --> 00:36:28,831
Do you imagine those hands are hot or cold?

282
00:36:28,933 --> 00:36:31,629
And just think what a single snip could do.

283
00:36:31,769 --> 00:36:33,532
Or undo.

284
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,032
Eddie.

285
00:36:37,142 --> 00:36:40,543
The guys and I want to invite you
to our card game Friday night.

286
00:36:40,612 --> 00:36:42,409
Would you like that?

287
00:36:42,514 --> 00:36:44,573
Only thing is... you can't cut!

288
00:36:57,762 --> 00:37:02,324
I have my own infirmity.
Never did me a bit of harm.

289
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:08,168
Took some shrapnel during the war,
and ever since then I can't feel a damn thing!

290
00:37:08,239 --> 00:37:11,606
Don't you ever let anybody tell you
you have a handicap.

291
00:37:11,676 --> 00:37:14,941
Who's handicapped? My goodness.

292
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:19,480
Don't be ridiculous!
You're not handicapped, you're...

293
00:37:19,584 --> 00:37:22,485
What do they call the... ex ceptional?

294
00:37:23,955 --> 00:37:29,086
My name's Joyce, and I noticed that you
have not tasted any of the ambrosia salad

295
00:37:29,194 --> 00:37:31,560
that I made especially for you.

296
00:37:32,397 --> 00:37:34,456
Allow me.

297
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:47,002
- You must try this. It's my mother's recipe.
- Doesn't this look gorgeous?

298
00:37:47,078 --> 00:37:51,606
With a green thumb like yours,
I sure could use your help at my place.

299
00:37:52,984 --> 00:37:54,679
I want a row of angels!

300
00:37:54,819 --> 00:38:00,314
I am so sorry, ladies, but he's promised to
come to my house first. Haven't you, Eddie?

301
00:38:00,425 --> 00:38:03,861
- I did?
- OK, everybody, grab your plates!

302
00:38:03,928 --> 00:38:05,691
Soup's on!

303
00:38:07,865 --> 00:38:10,026
What?

304
00:38:10,101 --> 00:38:12,592
It is shish kebab. It was a figure of speech.

305
00:38:12,670 --> 00:38:15,138
You shouldn't take things so literally.

306
00:38:18,443 --> 00:38:23,107
"Let us pretend we are in the drawing
room and the hostess is serving tea."

307
00:38:24,949 --> 00:38:28,077
"Many numerous little questions
confront us."

308
00:38:30,722 --> 00:38:34,089
"Should the man rise
when he accepts his cup of tea?"

309
00:38:35,927 --> 00:38:39,055
"May lump sugar be taken with the fingers?"

310
00:38:39,130 --> 00:38:40,358
No.

311
00:38:40,465 --> 00:38:43,298
"Is it good form to accept a second cup?"

312
00:38:44,502 --> 00:38:47,733
"Should the napkin be entirely unfolded,

313
00:38:47,872 --> 00:38:51,103
or should the center crease
be allowed to remain?"

314
00:38:51,175 --> 00:38:54,076
"It is so easy to commit
embarrassing blunders,

315
00:38:54,145 --> 00:38:57,740
but etiquette tells us
just what is expected of us

316
00:38:57,882 --> 00:39:01,716
and guards us from all
humiliation and discomfort."

317
00:39:08,993 --> 00:39:11,325
Yes. Boring.

318
00:39:11,396 --> 00:39:13,489
Let us switch to...

319
00:39:14,465 --> 00:39:16,524
To some poetry, hm?

320
00:39:21,005 --> 00:39:23,496
"There was an old man from the Cape,"

321
00:39:23,574 --> 00:39:26,134
"Who made himself garments of crepe."

322
00:39:26,210 --> 00:39:28,337
"When asked: Will they tear?"

323
00:39:28,413 --> 00:39:30,540
"He replied: Here and there,"

324
00:39:30,615 --> 00:39:33,140
"But they keep such a beautiful shape!"

325
00:39:35,353 --> 00:39:37,116
That's right.

326
00:39:37,188 --> 00:39:39,554
Go ahead, smile. It's funny.

327
00:40:03,548 --> 00:40:05,015
We're home.

328
00:40:05,116 --> 00:40:06,947
Shit.

329
00:40:07,018 --> 00:40:08,815
Everything's still sopping.

330
00:40:08,953 --> 00:40:12,411
- I can hardly wait to take a shower.
- And to sleep in a bed.

331
00:40:12,523 --> 00:40:15,390
If my parents have the alarm set,
I'm screwed.

332
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:19,021
I told you to call them
and tell them we're coming back early.

333
00:40:19,130 --> 00:40:21,655
- But did you?
- Nope, he'd rather complain.

334
00:40:21,766 --> 00:40:23,961
How else am I supposed to get attention?

335
00:40:24,035 --> 00:40:28,062
- You didn't call your parents.
- They don't run things like a police state.

336
00:40:28,172 --> 00:40:30,766
Bye. Thanks for driving, Denny.

337
00:40:31,442 --> 00:40:32,568
Bye.

338
00:40:32,643 --> 00:40:34,770
- Don't forget your arm!
- Oh, yeah.

339
00:40:34,846 --> 00:40:36,973
Come on, Jim, let's go.

340
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:39,708
There's somebody in my room! Go look!

341
00:41:39,811 --> 00:41:43,144
He's a murderer! He's got an ax!
He tried to kill me!

342
00:41:43,247 --> 00:41:45,511
Everything's OK.

343
00:41:45,616 --> 00:41:47,675
Go back to bed, Kevin.

344
00:41:52,557 --> 00:41:54,821
This way.

345
00:41:54,892 --> 00:41:59,488
Edward's come to live with us.
There is nothing to be upset about.

346
00:42:01,332 --> 00:42:04,130
We'll have you set up here in a minute.

347
00:42:04,235 --> 00:42:07,534
We got a full queen-size bed here,
believe it or not.

348
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:12,041
It's all made and everything. Good.

349
00:42:12,109 --> 00:42:13,770
There you go.

350
00:42:13,878 --> 00:42:15,903
What's the matter? What's wrong?

351
00:42:16,047 --> 00:42:18,106
She get you nervous?

352
00:42:18,916 --> 00:42:22,113
You've been cloistered away
up in that castle too long.

353
00:42:22,186 --> 00:42:27,249
You don't know about the wonderful world
of teenage girls. They're all crazy.

354
00:42:28,159 --> 00:42:31,788
- Here, this'll straighten you right out.
- What is it?

355
00:42:31,896 --> 00:42:33,955
Lemonade.

356
00:42:40,171 --> 00:42:41,934
I don't know what it is.

357
00:42:42,974 --> 00:42:45,101
They reach a certain age...

358
00:42:45,610 --> 00:42:49,410
They develop these gland things,
their bodies swell up...

359
00:42:50,181 --> 00:42:51,808
They go crazy.

360
00:42:54,952 --> 00:42:56,317
Glands?

361
00:42:57,388 --> 00:42:59,481
Yeah, glands.

362
00:43:00,124 --> 00:43:02,183
I try not to think about it.

363
00:43:20,011 --> 00:43:22,605
Good, isn't it?

364
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:27,776
Now, you stay in Kevin's room tonight
and tomorrow we'll fix your room right up.

365
00:43:27,852 --> 00:43:29,717
Why did you have to bring him here?

366
00:43:29,787 --> 00:43:33,188
I couldn't have left him all alone.
You'd have done the same.

367
00:43:33,257 --> 00:43:35,157
Why does he have to stay here?

368
00:43:35,226 --> 00:43:38,957
My goodness, Kim, I'm surprised at you.
He can't help the way he is.

369
00:43:39,063 --> 00:43:42,328
- Have a little sympathy.
- I do have sympathy.

370
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:46,359
Then say a little greeting.
Come downstairs, shake the man's hand...

371
00:43:46,437 --> 00:43:49,201
- Shake his hand?!
- Well, not literally.

372
00:43:49,273 --> 00:43:53,403
- Goodness, you scared him half to death!
- I scared him to death?

373
00:43:58,482 --> 00:44:04,182
Hi, Bill! I just wanted you two
to have a proper introduction.

374
00:44:04,255 --> 00:44:06,416
Edward, this is our daughter Kim.

375
00:44:06,557 --> 00:44:09,958
Kim, this is Edward,
who's gonna live with us.

376
00:44:15,967 --> 00:44:17,229
Hi.

377
00:44:31,382 --> 00:44:33,179
Eddie!

378
00:44:33,250 --> 00:44:35,013
Thirsty?

379
00:44:38,456 --> 00:44:40,515
Kisses! Hush up!

380
00:44:42,460 --> 00:44:44,655
Quiet now!

381
00:44:44,729 --> 00:44:50,429
Darlin', I can hardly hear myself think!
Momma's precious little baby girl...

382
00:44:54,271 --> 00:44:57,729
Wouldn't you like
a nice cool glass of lemonade?

383
00:44:58,442 --> 00:44:59,932
Lemonade?

384
00:45:09,553 --> 00:45:12,488
One chop to a guy's neck, and it's all over.

385
00:45:14,458 --> 00:45:17,859
Sharpest things in the world.
They can hack through anything.

386
00:45:18,729 --> 00:45:20,162
And...

387
00:45:38,282 --> 00:45:40,045
They give me the creeps.

388
00:45:40,117 --> 00:45:43,177
You should see the clown
in Miss Peters' yard.

389
00:45:43,888 --> 00:45:45,185
Kim!

390
00:45:46,257 --> 00:45:48,452
- Oh, no.
- That's him?

391
00:45:48,526 --> 00:45:50,721
- He's calling you, Kimba.
- Stop it!

392
00:45:50,795 --> 00:45:53,525
Edward, you forgot your cookies.

393
00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:58,591
Don't worry, Eddie. She's waiting for ya!

394
00:45:58,703 --> 00:46:01,103
- Stop!
- Let's go.

395
00:46:07,611 --> 00:46:10,079
Bill, Edward had lunch at Jackie's today

396
00:46:10,147 --> 00:46:13,207
and she just had her kitchen
completely redone.

397
00:46:13,317 --> 00:46:16,548
- I'll be darned.
- New paint, new cabinets, new floors,

398
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:20,522
- a new microwave, new silent dishwasher...
- Isn't that wonderful?

399
00:46:20,591 --> 00:46:23,924
Jim, didn't you just tell me
your mom had her kitchen done too?

400
00:46:23,994 --> 00:46:26,588
Yeah, my dad bought himself
a bunch of new toys.

401
00:46:26,697 --> 00:46:30,155
Big-screen TV, CD players,
VCR with four heads...

402
00:46:30,301 --> 00:46:34,533
My goodness sake!
I wonder what it's like to be that rich.

403
00:46:35,306 --> 00:46:37,171
They keep things locked up.

404
00:46:37,308 --> 00:46:40,709
My father has his own room for his stuff
to make sure I can't use it.

405
00:46:40,778 --> 00:46:42,712
He won't even help me buy an old car.

406
00:46:42,780 --> 00:46:47,945
He probably wants you to pay for it yourself.
It builds character. You'll appreciate it more.

407
00:46:48,018 --> 00:46:49,508
Dad...!

408
00:46:49,587 --> 00:46:54,422
Speaking of money... I understand you're
not charging for your gardening, Edward.

409
00:46:54,525 --> 00:46:57,460
Now, Bill... Marge made him cookies today.

410
00:46:57,561 --> 00:46:59,620
Sweetheart...

411
00:47:00,531 --> 00:47:03,830
You can't buy
the necessities of life with cookies.

412
00:47:04,835 --> 00:47:07,668
You can't buy a car with cookies.
Am I right, Jim?

413
00:47:07,772 --> 00:47:09,865
That's true, sir, you can't.

414
00:47:11,408 --> 00:47:14,377
I can't eat that. He used his hands.

415
00:47:14,445 --> 00:47:16,845
I don't think it's sanitary.

416
00:47:21,652 --> 00:47:24,052
I'm sorry.

417
00:47:27,224 --> 00:47:30,091
Honey, you want me
to help you clean that up?

418
00:47:30,194 --> 00:47:32,094
No, that's OK.

419
00:47:32,830 --> 00:47:34,957
I'll be right back.

420
00:48:21,512 --> 00:48:26,506
Alexis? Oh, this can't possibly be my Alexis!

421
00:48:27,151 --> 00:48:31,349
She looks so beautiful! Look at you! Sweetie!

422
00:48:32,122 --> 00:48:34,215
She's gorgeous. Thank you!

423
00:48:36,093 --> 00:48:39,153
It won't be long.
She just has to decide on the style.

424
00:48:39,263 --> 00:48:41,356
And then it'll be fine.

425
00:48:52,710 --> 00:48:56,908
I was hopin' for somethin' big
and kinda bouffant. Kinda like mine?

426
00:48:56,981 --> 00:49:01,918
Now don't you worry, Kisses, you're gonna
be just fine. You're gonna be so pretty.

427
00:49:01,986 --> 00:49:03,715
Yes, you are.

428
00:49:20,137 --> 00:49:23,300
Oh! Eddie, is there anything you can't do?

429
00:49:23,407 --> 00:49:27,400
You take my very breath away, I swear.
Look at this!

430
00:49:28,979 --> 00:49:30,879
Have you ever cut a woman's hair?

431
00:49:30,948 --> 00:49:32,745
Would you cut mine?

432
00:50:40,617 --> 00:50:44,747
That was the single most thrillin' experience
of my whole life.

433
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:52,052
They're getting the head of the company!

434
00:51:52,122 --> 00:51:55,353
- I'm home!
- Hi, honey. We're in here.

435
00:51:55,459 --> 00:51:57,359
Hi.

436
00:51:57,461 --> 00:51:59,258
What did you do to your hair?

437
00:51:59,329 --> 00:52:01,422
Edward cut it. Isn't it wild?

438
00:52:03,067 --> 00:52:06,264
Hello? Oh, I can't believe
I'm talking to you in person.

439
00:52:06,336 --> 00:52:08,429
This is such an honor.

440
00:52:09,940 --> 00:52:12,431
Yes. He's right here.

441
00:52:12,543 --> 00:52:14,534
So then you know all about it.

442
00:52:14,645 --> 00:52:17,944
Well, that's exactly
what I've been using.

443
00:52:19,249 --> 00:52:24,983
Well, I've had a little trouble getting it
the right consistency... well, just a little.

444
00:52:25,956 --> 00:52:28,049
I'll try that.

445
00:52:30,260 --> 00:52:33,058
Well, what imaginative suggestions.

446
00:52:34,498 --> 00:52:37,990
I sure will. Thank you so much. Bye-bye.

447
00:52:39,103 --> 00:52:41,333
No wonder she's the head of the company.

448
00:52:41,405 --> 00:52:45,068
You know, she started out as
a sales representative just like me.

449
00:52:45,142 --> 00:52:48,942
I've always wanted to talk to her,
but until now I never had a reason.

450
00:52:49,012 --> 00:52:51,105
Thanks, Edward.

451
00:52:52,015 --> 00:52:54,415
- She had some ideas?
- You bet she did.

452
00:53:08,899 --> 00:53:10,958
I'll get that.

453
00:53:52,276 --> 00:53:54,574
Edward. We're here.

454
00:53:54,678 --> 00:53:57,010
Come on, let's get you sharpened up.

455
00:54:00,384 --> 00:54:03,012
- You got it?
- No. I can't believe this.

456
00:54:03,086 --> 00:54:04,986
This is such a drag.

457
00:54:06,089 --> 00:54:07,556
Hi!

458
00:54:11,028 --> 00:54:13,087
Bye.

459
00:54:14,431 --> 00:54:16,160
Do you have a key?

460
00:54:16,233 --> 00:54:17,427
No.

461
00:54:17,501 --> 00:54:21,767
- I could have sworn they were in my purse.
- Well, we're stranded.

462
00:54:26,043 --> 00:54:28,102
Wow! Thanks!

463
00:54:29,379 --> 00:54:33,713
Ed! What a guy! Good job.
You didn't break it or scratch it or anything.

464
00:54:33,817 --> 00:54:36,581
Be a pal and yell when Peg pulls in.

465
00:54:39,990 --> 00:54:43,517
Quite a story, yes?
Any questions for Edward?

466
00:54:43,660 --> 00:54:45,787
Yeah? Get away over.

467
00:54:45,862 --> 00:54:47,295
Stand right up.

468
00:54:47,397 --> 00:54:50,491
What's been the best part
of your new life here in town?

469
00:54:50,601 --> 00:54:52,865
The friends I've made.

470
00:54:54,805 --> 00:54:56,830
Any other questions?

471
00:54:57,674 --> 00:55:01,610
Have you ever thought of having
corrective surgery or prosthetics?

472
00:55:01,712 --> 00:55:04,545
I know a doctor
that might be able to help you.

473
00:55:05,249 --> 00:55:06,876
I'd like to meet him.

474
00:55:06,950 --> 00:55:10,545
We'll get that name after the show.
Thank you. That's very nice.

475
00:55:10,687 --> 00:55:12,917
Anyone else? Yes, stand right up.

476
00:55:13,023 --> 00:55:15,514
But then you'd be like everyone else.

477
00:55:16,126 --> 00:55:17,616
Yes, I know.

478
00:55:17,728 --> 00:55:19,355
I think he'd like that.

479
00:55:19,463 --> 00:55:22,057
But then no one would
think you were special.

480
00:55:22,132 --> 00:55:24,259
You wouldn't be on TV or anything.

481
00:55:24,334 --> 00:55:27,360
No matter what,
Edward will always be special.

482
00:55:33,176 --> 00:55:35,770
More questions? Yes. Stand right up.

483
00:55:36,346 --> 00:55:39,440
Your work is so interesting,
distinctive and unique.

484
00:55:39,516 --> 00:55:42,508
Do you have any plans
to open your own beauty salon?

485
00:55:42,586 --> 00:55:44,713
Oh, there's an idea!

486
00:55:47,724 --> 00:55:50,522
Anyone else? Yeah. Stand right up.

487
00:55:50,594 --> 00:55:53,461
Do you have a girlfriend?

488
00:55:57,601 --> 00:55:59,535
Sure he does. Right, Kim?

489
00:55:59,603 --> 00:56:02,538
- Right, Kim?
- Great! Now you got him started.

490
00:56:02,606 --> 00:56:04,369
Knock it off, bubble-butt.

491
00:56:04,474 --> 00:56:06,101
- You did it.
- So?

492
00:56:07,210 --> 00:56:10,771
How about it, Edward?
Is there some special lady in your life?

493
00:56:41,144 --> 00:56:46,138
Everything's all right. We'll take a break
and we'll be back after these messages.

494
00:56:46,216 --> 00:56:48,116
Why are you laughing? He got hurt!

495
00:56:48,185 --> 00:56:51,712
- It was just a little shock. What do you care?
- A little shock?!

496
00:56:52,255 --> 00:56:56,817
I wish we'd been taping that.
I'd give my left nut to see that again.

497
00:56:57,461 --> 00:57:00,021
Aren't you ex cited? This is so thrillin'!

498
00:57:00,130 --> 00:57:04,794
Wait till I show it to you. It's just perfect.
It's just what we've been lookin' for.

499
00:57:04,868 --> 00:57:07,359
I wanna call it Shear Heaven!

500
00:57:10,273 --> 00:57:12,207
And here we are.

501
00:57:12,275 --> 00:57:15,369
Now, all along here
I'm gonna put a row of new mirrors.

502
00:57:15,445 --> 00:57:17,845
And back along here, well, I think...

503
00:57:17,948 --> 00:57:19,813
Eddie! Come along, doll.

504
00:57:19,883 --> 00:57:25,378
Back up here a whole row of new cosmetics.
And all along this row here...

505
00:57:27,758 --> 00:57:30,386
- Peg could sell cosmetics.
- Yeah... Sure.

506
00:57:30,460 --> 00:57:33,224
And this of course
is where we wash the hair.

507
00:57:33,296 --> 00:57:37,164
And here is where I stand...
when I greet the customers.

508
00:57:37,234 --> 00:57:40,362
But back in here
is what I really wanna show you.

509
00:57:44,274 --> 00:57:48,438
Eddie... This is what
I really want to show you.

510
00:57:48,512 --> 00:57:51,777
Now, this is the storeroom
where we keep everything,

511
00:57:51,882 --> 00:57:56,046
and what I need from you today
is a decision I need you to help me make.

512
00:57:56,119 --> 00:57:59,179
Honey, no! No, don't. That's dangerous.

513
00:57:59,256 --> 00:58:01,724
Now, you just sit right down there...

514
00:58:03,994 --> 00:58:08,454
I have some smocks.
Would you like me to model them for you?

515
00:58:08,899 --> 00:58:10,264
Yes.

516
00:58:10,333 --> 00:58:12,426
OK.

517
00:58:39,496 --> 00:58:41,555
Now, this is my favorite.

518
00:58:42,632 --> 00:58:44,691
Because it's yellow...

519
00:58:46,269 --> 00:58:48,237
And what it's for...

520
00:58:49,840 --> 00:58:53,970
is to catch those itchy little
trimmings that fall down your neck.

521
00:58:56,847 --> 00:59:02,479
And then there's this old purple one
that you kinda drape around you like this.

522
00:59:05,055 --> 00:59:07,114
I like that one.

523
00:59:10,126 --> 00:59:12,151
Why, Eddie, you're tremblin'.

524
00:59:15,065 --> 00:59:16,760
So am I!

525
00:59:19,302 --> 00:59:21,770
I've been waitin' for this moment for so long.

526
01:00:02,045 --> 01:00:03,979
Edward!

527
01:00:04,047 --> 01:00:07,016
Edward, you come back here!
You can't do that!

528
01:00:18,962 --> 01:00:20,987
Velcro, sweetheart.

529
01:00:21,064 --> 01:00:23,999
- It hangs on the dashboard.
- I've never seen that.

530
01:00:24,067 --> 01:00:26,058
- Sorry I'm late.
- Hi, Edward.

531
01:00:26,169 --> 01:00:29,263
Sorry, dear, we had to go ahead without you.
There you go.

532
01:00:29,372 --> 01:00:32,068
So, Edward, did you have a productive day?

533
01:00:32,175 --> 01:00:34,643
Mrs Monroe showed me
where the salon will be.

534
01:00:34,744 --> 01:00:38,339
- You could have a cosmetics counter.
- Wouldn't that be great?

535
01:00:39,182 --> 01:00:40,410
Great.

536
01:00:40,483 --> 01:00:43,850
Then she showed me the back room
where she took all her clothes off.

537
01:00:44,788 --> 01:00:48,656
Edward, I can't tell you how thrilled I am.
I'm as pleased as punch.

538
01:00:48,758 --> 01:00:51,249
This venture's gonna teach you volumes.

539
01:00:51,361 --> 01:00:54,296
There's nothin' like
running your own business.

540
01:00:54,397 --> 01:00:56,228
I've never done it myself,

541
01:00:56,299 --> 01:01:00,429
but I gather it's the greatest satisfaction
a working man can have.

542
01:01:01,204 --> 01:01:04,230
So I guess the bank's
gonna be your next step, huh?

543
01:01:04,307 --> 01:01:05,899
The bank?

544
01:01:06,042 --> 01:01:09,478
Yeah. Take out a loan, get yourself started.

545
01:01:10,313 --> 01:01:15,410
Nothin' to worry about. With your talent
and reputation, it's gonna be a snap.

546
01:01:19,705 --> 01:01:21,502
No credit,

547
01:01:21,607 --> 01:01:24,007
no record of jobs you've held,

548
01:01:24,143 --> 01:01:25,940
no savings,

549
01:01:26,011 --> 01:01:28,138
no personal investments...

550
01:01:28,847 --> 01:01:32,305
No social security number -
you may as well not even exist...

551
01:01:32,384 --> 01:01:36,548
- There is no collateral.
- No, we already have a second on the house.

552
01:01:36,622 --> 01:01:38,852
But don't the testimonials count?

553
01:01:38,957 --> 01:01:42,825
Did you see here the mayor's wife
can't wait to become a client?

554
01:01:42,928 --> 01:01:44,862
We simply can't do it.

555
01:01:44,963 --> 01:01:50,162
Now, get yourself a social security card,
establish credit and buy yourself a car.

556
01:01:50,235 --> 01:01:54,194
You have a decided advantage.
You can get a handicapped placard

557
01:01:54,273 --> 01:01:56,070
and park anywhere you like.

558
01:01:59,178 --> 01:02:02,045
I can't believe it. It's just an outrage.

559
01:02:02,181 --> 01:02:06,982
But don't you worry. This isn't the end of it.
We'll get your money somehow.

560
01:02:08,620 --> 01:02:13,614
- But that's breaking and entering.
- My parents have insurance up the rear.

561
01:02:13,692 --> 01:02:17,253
What'll it cost them?
A little hassle, that's about it.

562
01:02:17,362 --> 01:02:20,490
- We can't.
- This guy'll give us cash for the stuff.

563
01:02:20,599 --> 01:02:22,191
I don't want to.

564
01:02:22,267 --> 01:02:26,761
You don't want us to have our own van where
we can be alone? And a mattress in the back?

565
01:02:26,839 --> 01:02:28,397
Why can't you do it?

566
01:02:28,474 --> 01:02:31,602
Because the room's locked
and we need Edward to get us in.

567
01:02:31,677 --> 01:02:33,975
Can't you take the key when he's sleeping?

568
01:02:34,046 --> 01:02:37,209
The only thing he hangs on to tighter
is his dick.

569
01:02:37,316 --> 01:02:40,683
- Razor Blades'll do anything for you.
- That's not true.

570
01:02:40,786 --> 01:02:43,482
- Oh, no? Why don't you ask him?
- That's not fair.

571
01:02:43,589 --> 01:02:47,116
- So what? There isn't any other way.
- There's gotta be.

572
01:02:48,393 --> 01:02:50,327
Look, I've racked my brain.

573
01:02:50,429 --> 01:02:52,624
Don't you want us to have our own van?

574
01:02:52,698 --> 01:02:54,893
Yeah.

575
01:02:57,536 --> 01:02:59,333
Jim, the lights are on!

576
01:02:59,438 --> 01:03:03,272
Those go on automatically.
They're gone for the weekend, I told you.

577
01:03:03,342 --> 01:03:05,071
In case of burglars.

578
01:03:05,144 --> 01:03:07,612
- You turned off the alarm?
- Yes. Let's go.

579
01:03:07,679 --> 01:03:09,544
I hate this.

580
01:03:09,648 --> 01:03:13,049
Are you sure he doesn't know
this is Jim's house?

581
01:03:13,752 --> 01:03:16,277
- This person stole from you?
- Keep it down!

582
01:03:16,355 --> 01:03:18,414
I told you he stole it, OK? Let's go!

583
01:03:18,490 --> 01:03:21,323
Tell his parents
and they'll make him give it back.

584
01:03:21,426 --> 01:03:25,886
Listen, I already tried that.
Now, you told Kim you'd do this. Let's go.

585
01:03:25,964 --> 01:03:27,761
Come on!

586
01:03:32,571 --> 01:03:34,664
OK, come on.

587
01:04:04,069 --> 01:04:06,663
The bastard had it wired separately.
Come on!

588
01:04:06,738 --> 01:04:08,968
No, Jim, we can't just leave him here!

589
01:04:17,082 --> 01:04:18,879
- Come on.
- I'm not gonna do this!

590
01:04:18,951 --> 01:04:21,010
- Just come on, Kim.
- Stop!

591
01:04:21,620 --> 01:04:23,713
Put me down!

592
01:04:51,750 --> 01:04:53,775
We know you're in there!

593
01:04:54,253 --> 01:04:58,952
We're in the process of deactivating
the system so that you can come out!

594
01:05:11,003 --> 01:05:12,800
- Denny, turn around!
- No way.

595
01:05:12,871 --> 01:05:15,999
Jim, they can't arrest you
for setting off your own alarm.

596
01:05:16,074 --> 01:05:17,939
We'll tell 'em we freaked and ran.

597
01:05:18,010 --> 01:05:20,342
- I'm not going back there, OK?
- We have to!

598
01:05:20,412 --> 01:05:22,209
No. My father would prosecute.

599
01:05:22,347 --> 01:05:24,474
- His own son?
- Especially his own son.

600
01:05:24,583 --> 01:05:26,744
And if Edward tells I'll kill him!

601
01:05:27,419 --> 01:05:29,478
- Denny, turn around!
- No!

602
01:05:29,588 --> 01:05:31,055
You have to!

603
01:05:31,156 --> 01:05:34,956
We want your hands high in the air
where we can see them!

604
01:05:40,198 --> 01:05:42,257
Put your hands up!

605
01:05:47,439 --> 01:05:49,999
He's holding something. Looks like knives.

606
01:05:50,075 --> 01:05:51,872
Drop your weapons!

607
01:05:53,211 --> 01:05:55,805
I repeat - drop your weapons!

608
01:05:55,881 --> 01:06:00,682
I'm gonna ask you one more time.
This is your last warning. Drop your weapons.

609
01:06:05,023 --> 01:06:09,983
If you fail to do so we'll have to open fire.
Don't make us do that, buddy.

610
01:06:10,062 --> 01:06:13,122
Drop your weapons. Drop 'em!

611
01:06:13,231 --> 01:06:14,528
Now!

612
01:06:14,633 --> 01:06:16,533
Looks like we got a psycho.

613
01:06:16,635 --> 01:06:18,660
- Prepare to fire!
- No!

614
01:06:18,737 --> 01:06:22,867
- Stand back, ladies!
- Those aren't weapons, those are his hands!

615
01:06:22,941 --> 01:06:25,034
Please. We know him.

616
01:06:26,712 --> 01:06:28,304
All right. Cuff him.

617
01:06:35,220 --> 01:06:39,088
- But we can see him now?
- We're going to have to hold him overnight.

618
01:06:39,157 --> 01:06:43,821
- He has to stay in prison all night?
- You can pick him up in the morning.

619
01:06:43,895 --> 01:06:45,954
Oh, Edward!

620
01:06:46,098 --> 01:06:48,293
Hello, Edward.

621
01:06:48,433 --> 01:06:50,924
Oh, Edward, dear. I blame myself.

622
01:06:51,036 --> 01:06:54,335
What in God's name
was going through your mind, son?

623
01:06:54,473 --> 01:06:59,069
Why didn't I set a better example?
You saw how I envied Jim's parents.

624
01:06:59,144 --> 01:07:01,339
What were you gonna do with that stuff?

625
01:07:01,480 --> 01:07:04,847
I blithely say "We'll get money
for the salon somehow,"

626
01:07:04,916 --> 01:07:06,850
but I never meant stealing.

627
01:07:06,918 --> 01:07:11,287
Dear, stealing's not the way to get it.
Stealing's not the way to get anything.

628
01:07:11,356 --> 01:07:15,122
Ex cept trouble.
And you're in a serious heap of that.

629
01:07:15,193 --> 01:07:17,855
Oh, Edward. Why ever did you do this?

630
01:07:17,929 --> 01:07:21,524
- Damn those TV programs!
- Damn them all to hell!

631
01:07:21,600 --> 01:07:23,761
Or did somebody put you up to this?

632
01:07:36,915 --> 01:07:39,281
Will he be OK, doc?

633
01:07:39,351 --> 01:07:44,379
The years spent in isolation have not given
him the tools to judge right from wrong.

634
01:07:44,523 --> 01:07:47,822
He's had no context.
He's been completely without guidance.

635
01:07:47,926 --> 01:07:51,885
Furthermore his work, the garden sculptures,
hairstyles and so forth,

636
01:07:51,963 --> 01:07:54,796
indicate that he's a highly imaginative...

637
01:07:54,900 --> 01:07:56,231
character.

638
01:07:56,334 --> 01:08:00,532
His awareness of what we call reality
is radically underdeveloped.

639
01:08:00,605 --> 01:08:03,574
But will he be all right out there?

640
01:08:03,975 --> 01:08:06,034
Oh, yeah. He'll be fine.

641
01:08:12,184 --> 01:08:17,747
Listen, it could keep me up all night worrying
about ya. You watch yourself, you hear?

642
01:08:22,961 --> 01:08:25,725
I happened to be up,
so I heard all this noise...

643
01:08:25,797 --> 01:08:29,665
All along I felt in my gut
there was somethin' wrong with him.

644
01:08:31,069 --> 01:08:34,596
- It could have been my house.
- Or any of our houses, but...

645
01:08:34,673 --> 01:08:38,837
I warned you, didn't I?
I saw the sign of Satan on him.

646
01:08:38,944 --> 01:08:43,779
You didn't heed my warning, but now
you will. Because now you can see it too.

647
01:08:59,598 --> 01:09:01,361
Edward, you stay here.

648
01:09:01,433 --> 01:09:04,630
- What do you say in your defense?
- Nothing.

649
01:09:04,703 --> 01:09:08,036
- He doesn't want to talk.
- You have to say something.

650
01:09:08,106 --> 01:09:11,633
- He can't talk right now.
- No comments? No remarks?

651
01:09:11,710 --> 01:09:15,043
So, were you set up?
What was going through your mind?

652
01:09:15,113 --> 01:09:17,877
What do you have to say for yourself?

653
01:09:17,983 --> 01:09:21,282
- One comment.
- Later.

654
01:09:22,020 --> 01:09:25,421
Goodness, Lois, it looks like
I'll see you at our Christmas party

655
01:09:25,490 --> 01:09:27,754
before I get you over for your haircut!

656
01:09:27,859 --> 01:09:33,297
Well, of course we're gonna have it this year.
We have it every year. Why wouldn't we?

657
01:09:35,567 --> 01:09:36,966
Well!

658
01:09:37,068 --> 01:09:39,866
You may think that, but you're wrong.

659
01:09:44,543 --> 01:09:46,636
You're here.

660
01:09:48,480 --> 01:09:50,539
They didn't hurt you, did they?

661
01:09:53,318 --> 01:09:55,081
Were you scared?

662
01:09:58,657 --> 01:10:03,287
I tried to make Jim go back,
but you can't make Jim do anything.

663
01:10:09,834 --> 01:10:12,234
Thank you for not telling them that we...

664
01:10:12,837 --> 01:10:14,634
You're welcome.

665
01:10:17,742 --> 01:10:21,337
It must have been awful
when they told you whose house it was.

666
01:10:23,248 --> 01:10:25,307
I knew it was Jim's house.

667
01:10:26,017 --> 01:10:28,076
You did?

668
01:10:28,887 --> 01:10:30,548
Yes.

669
01:10:32,457 --> 01:10:34,550
Well, then why'd you do it?

670
01:10:36,127 --> 01:10:38,652
Because you asked me to.

671
01:10:41,866 --> 01:10:43,424
Kimba!

672
01:10:43,535 --> 01:10:45,935
Kimmy!

673
01:10:54,145 --> 01:10:56,613
- Don't!
- What's the matter with you?

674
01:10:56,681 --> 01:10:58,911
When are you gonna stop? I did what I could.

675
01:10:59,017 --> 01:11:02,418
My old man thinks he's retarded, so he's free.
What more do you want?

676
01:11:02,487 --> 01:11:05,820
- You could tell the truth.
- So could you. You were there too!

677
01:11:05,890 --> 01:11:09,724
- You know I didn't wanna do it.
- But you did do it.

678
01:11:10,428 --> 01:11:13,124
I don't get why you give such a shit anyway.

679
01:11:43,895 --> 01:11:47,991
Maybe there's a way you can
replace the drapes and the towels,

680
01:11:48,099 --> 01:11:51,694
but our confidence in you
is not gonna be so easy to replace.

681
01:11:51,770 --> 01:11:53,328
Dad...

682
01:11:54,472 --> 01:12:00,104
OK. A little ethics. You're walkin' down
the street. You find a suitcase full of money.

683
01:12:00,178 --> 01:12:04,615
There's nobody around. No human person
is in evidence. What do you do?

684
01:12:04,716 --> 01:12:07,116
A: You keep the money.

685
01:12:07,185 --> 01:12:11,679
B: You use it to buy gifts
for your friends and your loved ones.

686
01:12:11,756 --> 01:12:14,725
C: You give it to the poor.

687
01:12:15,427 --> 01:12:18,624
D: You turn it in to the police.

688
01:12:18,730 --> 01:12:21,130
- Dad, this is really stupid.
- Kim...!

689
01:12:21,199 --> 01:12:23,167
- I'd keep the money.
- Simmer down.

690
01:12:23,234 --> 01:12:24,496
Edward?

691
01:12:25,837 --> 01:12:29,933
Hey, how about after dinner we go down
to the bowling alley? That'd be fun.

692
01:12:30,008 --> 01:12:31,976
You're not seeing Jim tonight?

693
01:12:32,043 --> 01:12:33,533
No.

694
01:12:34,345 --> 01:12:36,404
We had the coolest show and tell today.

695
01:12:36,514 --> 01:12:41,383
This kid brought in a box of baby possums.
Ten, maybe twelve. Totally naked.

696
01:12:41,453 --> 01:12:45,651
- No hair at all.
- Honey, your father isn't finished yet.

697
01:12:46,124 --> 01:12:48,854
Thank you, dear. Edward, we're waiting.

698
01:12:51,963 --> 01:12:54,022
Give it to my loved ones?

699
01:12:57,235 --> 01:13:01,672
Oh, Edward, it does seem that
that's what you should do, but it's not.

700
01:13:04,609 --> 01:13:09,012
You dope, everybody knows
you're supposed to give it to the police.

701
01:13:10,615 --> 01:13:12,412
Good thinking, Kevin.

702
01:13:12,484 --> 01:13:15,078
Well, think about it, you guys.

703
01:13:15,186 --> 01:13:18,622
I mean, that's the nicer thing to do.
That's what I would do.

704
01:13:18,757 --> 01:13:24,627
We're not trying to confuse him, we're trying
to make things easier, so cut the comedy.

705
01:13:24,763 --> 01:13:27,857
I am being serious, Dad.
It's a much nicer thing to do.

706
01:13:27,966 --> 01:13:30,491
Forget nice. We're talking right and wrong.

707
01:13:30,969 --> 01:13:31,993
Shut up!

708
01:13:32,070 --> 01:13:38,202
Oh, goodness! No wonder poor Edward can't
learn right from wrong, living in this family!

709
01:13:38,276 --> 01:13:41,268
Well, did you hear
what he did to Peg's curtains?

710
01:13:41,379 --> 01:13:45,281
It's unbelievable they're having
their party anyway. Are you going?

711
01:13:45,383 --> 01:13:47,078
I don't think so.

712
01:13:47,185 --> 01:13:50,484
He practically raped Joyce,
threatening her with those knives.

713
01:13:50,588 --> 01:13:52,385
It's a miracle she escaped.

714
01:13:52,457 --> 01:13:54,652
I have nothing against Bill and Peg, but...

715
01:13:54,793 --> 01:13:58,058
I know. They've got that
teenage daughter in the house.

716
01:13:58,129 --> 01:14:01,064
Those poor things!
After what happened to me...

717
01:14:01,132 --> 01:14:02,895
Can you imagine?

718
01:14:03,001 --> 01:14:05,333
What did you say about the Christmas party?

719
01:14:05,436 --> 01:14:07,461
I said I hoped we could make it.

720
01:14:07,539 --> 01:14:09,473
I lied too.

721
01:14:29,460 --> 01:14:32,361
Edward? Do you want to
give me that new haircut?

722
01:14:32,964 --> 01:14:35,262
- Again?
- Yeah, sure!

723
01:14:35,333 --> 01:14:39,702
It makes me proud to have you
as my own personal hairdresser.

724
01:14:42,307 --> 01:14:44,138
Hi, honey.

725
01:14:44,242 --> 01:14:47,268
- Kevin, want to play scissors, paper, stone?
- No.

726
01:14:47,345 --> 01:14:50,576
- Why?
- It's boring. I'm tired of always winning.

727
01:14:50,682 --> 01:14:53,879
- People's feelings, please. A few manners!
- I'll be outside.

728
01:14:53,952 --> 01:14:58,286
Never you mind, dear. Just... cut away.

729
01:15:02,126 --> 01:15:05,789
" I saw three ships come sailing by

730
01:15:05,864 --> 01:15:08,424
" On Christmas day, on Christmas day

731
01:15:08,499 --> 01:15:11,195
" I saw three ships come sailing by

732
01:15:11,269 --> 01:15:14,136
" On Christmas day in the morning

733
01:15:21,179 --> 01:15:24,876
It needs something... else.
What do you think, honey?

734
01:15:24,949 --> 01:15:27,884
- More bells?
- OK.

735
01:15:27,952 --> 01:15:30,978
Mom, do you really think
we should be having this party?

736
01:15:31,089 --> 01:15:33,887
Of course I think
we should be having this party.

737
01:15:33,958 --> 01:15:40,591
It's just what we need to calm things down...
and everything'll go back to normal.

738
01:15:42,433 --> 01:15:44,594
Do you have any more bells, honey?

739
01:17:36,614 --> 01:17:38,809
Now you've done it.

740
01:17:38,916 --> 01:17:41,407
It's just a scratch, Jim, really. It's OK.

741
01:17:41,486 --> 01:17:44,512
- Touch her again and I'll kill ya.
- It's no big deal.

742
01:17:44,622 --> 01:17:47,284
- Call a doctor. He skewered Kim.
- No!

743
01:17:47,358 --> 01:17:49,223
Stay away from her. I mean it!

744
01:17:49,293 --> 01:17:53,559
You can't touch anything without ruining it.
Why do you hang around here anyway?

745
01:17:53,664 --> 01:17:58,158
I want you to sit right down
and wait for me to bring you some ice.

746
01:17:58,269 --> 01:18:00,794
Stay right there. I'll be right back.

747
01:18:00,872 --> 01:18:06,310
" On Christmas day in the morning

748
01:18:06,844 --> 01:18:09,278
Get the hell outta here!

749
01:18:09,781 --> 01:18:12,341
Get the hell out! Go! Freak!

750
01:18:13,117 --> 01:18:15,278
Hey, Edward, where are you goin'?

751
01:18:23,127 --> 01:18:24,754
Where is he?

752
01:18:24,862 --> 01:18:27,558
- He tried to hurt you.
- He did not, and you know it.

753
01:18:27,665 --> 01:18:30,133
Are you nuts? I just saw him!

754
01:18:30,201 --> 01:18:35,104
Jim, I don't love you any more.
I just want you to go, OK? Just go!

755
01:18:35,873 --> 01:18:37,568
Are you serious?

756
01:18:37,675 --> 01:18:40,269
And lose you to that? He isn't even human.

757
01:18:40,344 --> 01:18:43,074
Just get out of here, OK? Just go!

758
01:18:51,089 --> 01:18:53,114
Dad, did you see where Edward went?

759
01:18:53,191 --> 01:18:55,716
I don't know. He just waltzed down the street.

760
01:18:55,793 --> 01:18:58,762
- We have to find him, Mom.
- Your father will find him.

761
01:18:58,830 --> 01:19:01,094
Go on in the house. I'll take care of it.

762
01:19:01,165 --> 01:19:03,224
I'll go find him.

763
01:19:20,551 --> 01:19:21,813
Edward!

764
01:19:21,919 --> 01:19:24,012
I'm calling the police!

765
01:20:11,869 --> 01:20:15,202
See all that blood, sweetie?
And it's just a little cut.

766
01:20:25,483 --> 01:20:27,974
Hello. I'm here to see the man with the hands.

767
01:20:32,123 --> 01:20:34,284
He's not here. Thank you.

768
01:20:35,293 --> 01:20:37,488
Oh, dear.

769
01:20:39,263 --> 01:20:41,595
Helen, did you actually see him?

770
01:20:41,666 --> 01:20:43,258
Yes! Look!

771
01:20:48,940 --> 01:20:51,101
I'm looking for the man with the scissors.

772
01:20:51,209 --> 01:20:54,610
- Thank God you're here.
- He went right down that way, sir.

773
01:20:54,679 --> 01:20:58,274
All right, calm down.
Go on home. We'll handle it.

774
01:20:58,349 --> 01:21:00,214
Just go home.

775
01:21:00,284 --> 01:21:04,220
- A demon. A demon.
- You gotta do somethin'!

776
01:21:11,829 --> 01:21:14,320
I'm sure your father'll find him soon.

777
01:21:15,032 --> 01:21:17,125
What time is it?

778
01:21:17,668 --> 01:21:21,627
It's almost 8:30. Great party, huh?

779
01:21:21,706 --> 01:21:23,765
Mom, where are they?

780
01:21:25,343 --> 01:21:28,335
- God, I hope he's OK.
- So do l, honey.

781
01:21:33,784 --> 01:21:37,584
You know, when I brought Edward
down here to live with us,

782
01:21:38,990 --> 01:21:41,652
I really didn't think things through.

783
01:21:42,693 --> 01:21:45,856
And I didn't think about
what could happen to him.

784
01:21:47,198 --> 01:21:50,690
Or to us. Or to the neighborhood.

785
01:21:53,070 --> 01:21:55,163
And now I think that maybe...

786
01:21:56,907 --> 01:21:58,966
it might be best if he goes...

787
01:22:00,511 --> 01:22:02,570
back up there.

788
01:22:03,347 --> 01:22:05,508
Because at least there he's safe.

789
01:22:07,885 --> 01:22:10,547
And we'd just go back to normal.

790
01:22:13,157 --> 01:22:16,615
I got halfway to the Whitmans'.
I didn't see him anywhere.

791
01:22:16,727 --> 01:22:18,957
Let's get in the car and go look for him.

792
01:22:19,030 --> 01:22:21,021
- Where's Kevin now?
- At Max's.

793
01:22:21,165 --> 01:22:22,962
Oh, for God's sakes!

794
01:22:23,034 --> 01:22:25,730
- Where do you think you're goin'?
- With you guys.

795
01:22:25,803 --> 01:22:30,240
- You stay here in case somebody shows up.
- We'll be right back, dear.

796
01:23:09,080 --> 01:23:11,207
Police!

797
01:23:47,985 --> 01:23:50,044
Edward?

798
01:23:52,890 --> 01:23:54,585
Are you OK?

799
01:23:55,926 --> 01:23:57,723
Yes. Are you OK?

800
01:24:01,932 --> 01:24:03,729
Where is everybody?

801
01:24:04,468 --> 01:24:06,527
Out looking for you.

802
01:24:12,610 --> 01:24:14,510
Hold me.

803
01:24:28,325 --> 01:24:29,724
I can't.

804
01:24:58,489 --> 01:25:02,892
I know it's a little early
for Christmas, Edward, but...

805
01:25:06,263 --> 01:25:08,356
I have a present for you.

806
01:27:06,784 --> 01:27:08,615
Forget holding her hand.

807
01:27:08,686 --> 01:27:11,246
Picture the damage he could do other places.

808
01:27:11,322 --> 01:27:13,449
Yeah. That's sick.

809
01:27:19,129 --> 01:27:22,030
I feel like I'm gonna pass out
or puke or something.

810
01:27:22,099 --> 01:27:24,624
Later. First, take me to her house.

811
01:27:24,702 --> 01:27:26,602
Come on. Don't make me drive.

812
01:27:26,670 --> 01:27:28,194
Just do it!

813
01:27:28,739 --> 01:27:30,730
Jesus. Maybe she was right about you.

814
01:27:30,841 --> 01:27:32,900
- Just drive!
- Relax!

815
01:27:37,247 --> 01:27:40,216
- See you tomorrow. Call me.
- All right.

816
01:27:58,469 --> 01:28:00,733
Have they caught him yet?

817
01:28:01,505 --> 01:28:04,736
- Who?
- Him! That cripple.

818
01:28:08,345 --> 01:28:10,313
Let me know when they do.

819
01:28:12,383 --> 01:28:14,510
Let us all know, OK?

820
01:28:15,552 --> 01:28:17,645
Like a good boy.

821
01:28:38,175 --> 01:28:39,665
Kevin.

822
01:28:44,682 --> 01:28:46,309
Are you OK?

823
01:28:46,383 --> 01:28:47,907
It's OK.

824
01:28:51,755 --> 01:28:53,916
- Edward, stop!
- I'm your friend.

825
01:28:58,529 --> 01:28:59,996
Help us!

826
01:29:02,566 --> 01:29:05,399
What are you doing? Get away from him!

827
01:29:14,011 --> 01:29:15,911
- Let go of me!
- What?

828
01:29:15,979 --> 01:29:17,776
Kevin!

829
01:29:24,455 --> 01:29:27,583
- Get away!
- Edward, come home!

830
01:29:59,289 --> 01:30:00,347
Run.

831
01:30:27,918 --> 01:30:31,479
Kevin's all right!
It was just the tiniest scratch!

832
01:30:31,622 --> 01:30:35,888
He's gone. Let's not bother him, all right?
Let's just leave him alone.

833
01:30:44,401 --> 01:30:46,460
Go on, run.

834
01:30:51,041 --> 01:30:53,805
- What happened? Is he dead?
- Did you get him?

835
01:30:54,444 --> 01:30:57,538
It's all over. Go on home.
There's nothing more to see.

836
01:30:57,681 --> 01:31:02,277
What happened out there?
I want to know! I want some answers!

837
01:31:02,352 --> 01:31:04,912
It is all over.

838
01:31:05,022 --> 01:31:07,081
Where is he?

839
01:31:08,892 --> 01:31:12,055
Get back here!
I wanna ask you something!

840
01:31:18,302 --> 01:31:20,532
Look at that! I don't believe this.

841
01:31:21,872 --> 01:31:23,863
They don't have him. I'm goin'.

842
01:31:23,941 --> 01:31:26,034
No! That's not a good idea.

843
01:32:31,441 --> 01:32:33,534
They're coming?

844
01:32:36,113 --> 01:32:38,104
Did I hurt Kevin?

845
01:32:38,181 --> 01:32:41,742
No, he's OK. Mostly he was just scared.

846
01:32:43,754 --> 01:32:46,382
Edward, I was so afraid.

847
01:32:47,024 --> 01:32:49,254
I thought you were dead.

848
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:58,524
I didn't.

849
01:33:07,344 --> 01:33:08,834
No!

850
01:33:18,422 --> 01:33:20,083
No!

851
01:33:20,190 --> 01:33:22,181
Jim, stop!

852
01:33:39,109 --> 01:33:40,167
No!

853
01:33:43,780 --> 01:33:46,613
Stop it. Or I'll kill you myself.

854
01:33:58,595 --> 01:34:00,495
I said stay away from her!

855
01:35:00,657 --> 01:35:02,488
Goodbye.

856
01:35:13,770 --> 01:35:15,601
I love you.

857
01:36:03,820 --> 01:36:05,720
Is he in there?

858
01:36:07,924 --> 01:36:09,619
He's dead.

859
01:36:13,430 --> 01:36:15,591
The roof caved in on him.

860
01:36:16,666 --> 01:36:18,725
They killed each other.

861
01:36:21,571 --> 01:36:24,267
You can see for yourselves.

862
01:36:26,243 --> 01:36:27,972
See?

863
01:36:37,087 --> 01:36:39,180
I'm goin' home.

864
01:36:48,031 --> 01:36:50,090
Joyce...

865
01:37:07,284 --> 01:37:09,377
She never saw him again.

866
01:37:11,188 --> 01:37:13,281
Not after that night.

867
01:37:14,124 --> 01:37:16,217
How do you know?

868
01:37:22,999 --> 01:37:25,058
Because I was there.

869
01:37:25,702 --> 01:37:29,468
You could have gone up there.
You still could go.

870
01:37:30,807 --> 01:37:33,207
No, sweetheart.

871
01:37:33,276 --> 01:37:35,335
I'm an old woman now.

872
01:37:36,313 --> 01:37:39,111
I would rather him remember me
the way I was.

873
01:38:14,084 --> 01:38:16,143
How do you know he's still alive?

874
01:38:18,388 --> 01:38:20,549
I don't know.

875
01:38:20,657 --> 01:38:23,091
Not for sure, but...

876
01:38:23,660 --> 01:38:25,924
I believe he is.

877
01:38:35,305 --> 01:38:42,143
You see, before he came down here
it never snowed.

878
01:38:46,783 --> 01:38:50,378
And afterwards it did.

879
01:38:52,622 --> 01:38:57,559
If he weren't up there now,
I don't think it would be snowing.

880
01:39:00,163 --> 01:39:03,599
Sometimes you can still catch me
dancing in it.
