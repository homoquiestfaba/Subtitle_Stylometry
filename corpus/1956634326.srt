1
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:35,980
They're holding 459 suspects...

2
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:05,550
Wake up, Kansas City.

3
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:08,560
Did you know there's a street
gang summit in your town today?

4
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,060
That's right, Christians!

5
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:11,060
Satan's in town

6
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:13,530
and he's brought his minions
with him!

7
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:15,530
This was day was foretold
in Rev...

8
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,780
Over the years

9
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:34,280
I've developed a theory based
on the concept of "nigger."

10
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,780
What a nigger is...
what makes a nigger...

11
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:41,210
...and, most important

12
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:43,640
how to stop being a nigger.

13
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:48,150
Go tell that nigger
to quit honking
that horn.

14
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:49,150
No, fuck that nigger.

15
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:51,650
Make him wait.

16
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:56,150
Stop honking that horn,
crazy motherfucker!

17
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:12,620
Don't be running down
to Gramma Gomere's asking
for something to eat.

18
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:14,120
I won't.

19
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,620
Eat them crackers
I left in there.

20
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:19,590
I'm coming!

21
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,550
I find out your little
trouble-making butt
left this house tonight

22
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:29,540
I'll let them
take you this time.

23
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:31,540
I swear to God I will.

24
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:42,580
I never saw myself
as underprivileged.

25
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:45,090
South Street Philadelphia
was full of life.

26
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:48,590
And at night...

27
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:50,440
I couldn't resist.

28
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,560
The color, the music...

29
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,560
Hey.

30
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,180
...the people.

31
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:05,690
...with his tongue
halfway down her throat!

32
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:08,190
Hey, baby, hop in.

33
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:10,660
How you doing?

34
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:12,030
Mighty fine... damn!

35
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:16,530
Kiss me!

36
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:19,370
No, that's all right.

37
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:35,540
"Oh, thank you," she whispered.

38
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:37,770
"You will have my love

39
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:40,280
and the Queen's
grate... grate..."

40
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,780
Gratitude.

41
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:43,780
Carl!

42
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:45,280
Keep quiet, Carl.

43
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,760
Go on, Cynthia.

44
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:47,780
"...the Queen's...

45
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:50,750
"gratitude

46
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:53,240
if you help us."

47
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:59,240
"'Just tell me how
I may serve you,'
said D-D..."

48
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,750
D'Artagnan.

49
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:02,250
Carl, what's the matter
with you?

50
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:04,230
Don't you understand
English?

51
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:05,730
In the corner.

52
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:07,720
Now.

53
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:31,810
You have something
to say for yourself?

54
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:33,310
I was just trying
to help.

55
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:36,310
I'd say you have enough
of your own problems,
wouldn't you?

56
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:38,320
What's this yellow
you put in the flag?

57
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,320
We ran out
of white paint.

58
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,320
You realize
how dumb that is?

59
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,320
You don't put yellow
in the American flag!

60
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,330
Yellow is the color
of cowards!

61
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:48,330
Stop that.

62
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:49,330
You go home now.

63
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:50,830
And you keep
your mouth shut

64
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:52,330
unless I ask you
to open it.

65
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:53,830
Is that clear?

66
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:06,740
My thesis on niggers is based
on my own life

67
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:09,760
and, unfortunately, the lives
of far too many people.

68
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:13,250
In my terms, niggers are made,
not born.

69
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:17,760
I believe a baby shows up
"tabula rasa," clean slate.

70
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:20,760
Sometimes the immediate
conditions can be so bad

71
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,260
you'd say
they were born niggers

72
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:24,760
but I believe the process
takes place

73
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:26,250
after they've been infected

74
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:28,250
by their surroundings
and circumstances.

75
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:29,470
I don't think deep down

76
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:32,970
I've ever equated all
black people with "niggers."

77
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:35,470
Met a whole bunch
of white niggers in my day

78
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:36,970
as a matter of fact.

79
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,990
When people grow up
steeped in violence, ignorance

80
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:40,950
neglect and oppression

81
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:42,950
you have conditions
for niggerhood...

82
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:45,450
"Niggerization."

83
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:50,440
Good job, boy.

84
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,110
Thank you.

85
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:58,610
Hey, wait a minute!

86
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:00,620
Hey, it's an ugly word.

87
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:01,620
I know it.

88
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:03,620
But I'm talking
about some ugly shit.

89
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:08,090
And I'm all about getting
un-niggerized.

90
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:10,020
I'm gonna kick your
motherfucking ass!

91
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:12,500
Who's motherfucking
ass, nigger, huh?

92
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:14,600
Nigger, whose ass you gonna
whip, huh, motherfucker? Huh?

93
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,240
Whip whose motherfucking ass?

94
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,470
Stay the fuck down!

95
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:24,940
Stay down, motherfucking nigger!

96
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:28,180
Stay down, motherfucker.

97
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:31,800
I ought to cut
that motherfucker.

98
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,780
Yeah.

99
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:36,720
Well, I be

100
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,800
goddamned!

101
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,520
Come here, boy.

102
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,520
Bring your little ass
over here!

103
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,010
Hey, this is my boy.

104
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:45,890
I got girls all over

105
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:47,130
this motherfucking city

106
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:48,380
but this is my only boy.

107
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:51,880
He a good-looking little
motherfucker, too, ain't he?

108
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:52,880
That's right.

109
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,000
Carl Upchurch.

110
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,500
Hey, nigger's smart, too.

111
00:07:58,510 --> 00:07:59,960
What that say?

112
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:02,330
"South Street Liquor."

113
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:04,330
South Street Liquor.

114
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:06,330
I'll be goddamned!

115
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:09,300
Motherfucker...

116
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,800
Stay down, nigger!

117
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,270
What'd he do?

118
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:15,520
What'd he do?

119
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:19,040
Motherfucker pissed me off.

120
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:22,500
Look, boy, don't let a nigger
get up on you.

121
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,500
See, don't let a nigger

122
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,500
get up on you.

123
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,000
Keep his... keep his
ass off you.

124
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,500
You know, beat

125
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,140
that motherfucker down

126
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:32,140
before he beats you down.

127
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:33,140
You understand?

128
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,130
You can't be weak.

129
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:37,130
You hear me?

130
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:38,630
You can't be weak.

131
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:43,990
And good to see your little ass.

132
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:45,970
Come on, let's go
back in there.

133
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:48,220
Yeah.

134
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:05,220
Hey!

135
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:06,970
True to form and expectations

136
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:08,990
I grew to become
another example.

137
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:18,450
This ball's coming home
with me, man.

138
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,800
Fuck it!

139
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,310
No one gets it!

140
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:22,560
No, Fish!

141
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,560
What are you doing?

142
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:26,290
Are you nuts?

143
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:30,300
I was basically ignorant,
violent

144
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:31,770
and blind to the fact

145
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:34,770
that there was a whole
nother way to live life.

146
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:35,770
Hey.

147
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:42,280
Shut up,
motherfucker!

148
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:52,420
I'm very sorry,
Mrs. Fisher.

149
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:55,010
Ma'am, we need you
to come downtown with us

150
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:56,140
to identify the body.

151
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:57,140
Please.

152
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:06,080
Oh, my God...!

153
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,090
I'm so sorry.

154
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:11,570
Fuck it!

155
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:12,570
No one gets it!

156
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:13,570
No, Fish!

157
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:14,590
You must be crazy!

158
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:15,580
Are you nuts?

159
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:19,560
We're sorry,
Mrs. Fisher.

160
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:23,170
Oh, God... oh, God!

161
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:28,170
We've got to find them niggers
who killed him.

162
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:31,680
I know the nigger went down
swinging, man.

163
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:52,780
Hey.

164
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:56,280
Police telling people Tookie
and them Clymer boys did it.

165
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:00,790
You know, I think
they put the word out

166
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:03,640
because they want us
to do them niggers,
you know?

167
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,110
Save them
the trouble.

168
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:07,110
Ain't you going in?

169
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:08,610
No.

170
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:11,620
He was stupid
being out there alone.

171
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:14,620
You can't let a nigger get up
on you like that, man.

172
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:18,110
So what are we gonna do?

173
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:24,730
Hey, batter...

174
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:27,970
Bitch!

175
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:29,180
Get the fuck
out of here!

176
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:30,550
Go! Leave!

177
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,740
You baseball bitch!

178
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:38,560
You like baseball?

179
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,560
Kill my boy?

180
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:43,550
Stab this motherfucker, Bo!

181
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:44,550
Stab him!

182
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:46,020
He killed Fish!

183
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:49,870
Kill this motherfucker!

184
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,820
Motherfucker!

185
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:12,440
Most everybody wants
to be respected for something.

186
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,450
And among men, if you kick ass

187
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:16,450
everybody knows not
to fuck with you

188
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:17,950
You get plenty of respect.

189
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:39,770
That shit's universal.

190
00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:41,270
I mean, if Bill Gates

191
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:43,760
is in a dark alley
about to get his ass kicked

192
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,260
who do you think he wants
next to him?

193
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:46,260
His buddy Warren Buffett

194
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:49,000
or the baddest motherfucker
in town?

195
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:56,840
Billy, Billy, Billy.

196
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:59,340
Church...

197
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:01,340
You dealin' coke
on my block and shit?

198
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:02,340
No.

199
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:04,850
Callin' me out my name
behind my back?

200
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:06,180
What's that
he called me again?

201
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:07,180
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah...

202
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:10,150
dumb nigger.

203
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:11,390
Motherfucker...

204
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:13,390
don't do that shit
with me.

205
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:15,390
You shut the fuck up.

206
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:16,890
Find the shit, nigger!

207
00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:18,390
What the fuck
you waitin' for?

208
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:19,890
Cover your ass up!

209
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,900
Shut up, Billy.

210
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:27,870
I'm just a dumb nigger
with a prison GED...

211
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:30,870
but you a fuckin'
college graduate, Billy.

212
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:33,370
You're supposed
to know better.

213
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:34,880
All right,
we got it.

214
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,880
Yeah.

215
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:41,880
Who's the dumb nigger
now, huh, Billy?

216
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:43,500
I was sailin', Jack.

217
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:46,500
Inside, I'd learned to be
a better criminal,

218
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,990
a tougher motherfucker.

219
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:48,990
Outside, I looked forward

220
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:50,990
to putting my new knowledge
to work.

221
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:53,960
And if I got caught,
no problem.

222
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:56,160
I was only going back
to school...

223
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,750
and home.

224
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:58,750
Upchurch, Carl.

225
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:00,750
Bank robber. New arrival.

226
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:02,750
New?
Well, new here.

227
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:04,260
Been all through
the system.

228
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,260
Nothing but trouble,
so fuck him.

229
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:07,260
Guess they figured
they might as well

230
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:08,760
segregate his ass
right off the bat.

231
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:09,880
How long?

232
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,380
Who gives a shit?

233
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:14,880
Get his monkey ass
in there.

234
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,380
We'll see how uncontrollable
you are.

235
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,650
How the fuck
is that, huh?

236
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:32,270
Leave him alone!

237
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:40,560
Stupid fuckin' nigger.

238
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,060
Welcome to Lewisburg.

239
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:18,450
You're awake.

240
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:21,800
Lewisburg?

241
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:25,150
No, Martha's Vineyard.

242
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:27,150
It's pretty, ain't it?

243
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,770
Aw...

244
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:30,240
what the hell do you expect?

245
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,240
That's about the dumbest thing
I ever saw.

246
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:36,360
Aw, you done Seg
before, ain't you?

247
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:38,370
Know how I can tell?

248
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:40,370
'Cause you look like

249
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:41,870
you're about half
out your fuckin' mind.

250
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:43,870
Nothing personal.

251
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:48,130
I mean, 23-hour lockdown,
hour on the yard.

252
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:51,230
One motherfuckin'
shower a week.

253
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:54,230
A motherfucker gets stinky
and goofy.

254
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:56,230
Yeah...

255
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:01,240
You know how to read?

256
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,710
Lordy, shut the fuck up,
white boy.

257
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:06,560
Nigger can talk!

258
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,560
:
Oh, yeah.

259
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:09,560
Oh, yeah.

260
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:10,560
Ain't that
some shit.

261
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:12,580
I was just being
neighborly, chitlin.

262
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:14,050
Lettin' you know
the deal down here.

263
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:15,550
Shut the fuck up!

264
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:17,050
You see, here in Segregation

265
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:20,060
we got first crack
at the library books,

266
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:21,560
only most motherfuckers
in Seg,

267
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:23,180
they don't know
how to read them.

268
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:24,680
Maybe comic books

269
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:27,280
or magazines with girlie
pictures in them.

270
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:29,770
The dumbest motherfuckers'
only privilege

271
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:32,770
is first crack
at the library books.

272
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:36,270
Ain't that some cruel
funny shit?

273
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:43,230
Oh, you're gonna be
a fun neighbor.

274
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:45,930
Peters!

275
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:49,050
Peters, what you got to
stick all the dumb-ass

276
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:51,560
no-conversation niggers
next to me for?

277
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:53,060
Why don't you
shut your mouth

278
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:54,560
you cracker
piece of shit?

279
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:58,060
I'll tell you what--
you don't call me a
cracker piece of shit...

280
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:02,070
or a honky or a redneck...

281
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:03,570
and I won't call
you a nigger.

282
00:17:04,070 --> 00:17:06,570
I tell you what,
you cracker piece of shit

283
00:17:06,570 --> 00:17:09,570
honky, redneck, white boy,
inbred motherfucker--

284
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:11,580
shut the fuck up!

285
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:22,090
Aw, man, shut up!

286
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:36,100
You might as well
forget about that shit!

287
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,070
There's cheese in
the yellow box...

288
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:44,560
it's all lumpy...

289
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,560
so I said, "Bitch,
this had better be

290
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,560
some blue-box
macaroni."

291
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:51,930
You listening, Upchurch?

292
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:54,380
Fuck this shit!

293
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:55,860
You're the one
that needs saving!

294
00:17:55,850 --> 00:17:57,350
Go to hell!

295
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,370
Chap...

296
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,860
Chap... Chap, Chap!

297
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:01,080
Wait up, man!

298
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,580
Did you file
my grievance?

299
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:04,080
You talk
to the warden, man?

300
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,080
Habeas corpus, motherfucker!

301
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,580
Due process!

302
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:09,580
You can't throw me in
Segregation for no reason!

303
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:11,590
Peters!

304
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:12,550
Hey, Peters!

305
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:14,560
Peters, you
motherfucker!

306
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,060
Is that you, Mr. Upchurch?

307
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:17,060
How can I help you, sir?

308
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,160
Here, man!

309
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,010
Get me some
new food, man.

310
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:23,510
How am I supposed to live
on that shit?

311
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:27,850
I take it you won't be joining
us for supper tonight.

312
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:29,850
You know what else, man?

313
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:32,360
Get me something new to read,
goddamn it.

314
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,820
This shit is old!

315
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:35,310
Sports?

316
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:36,810
I told you to try
the fucking comics.

317
00:18:36,810 --> 00:18:40,200
I think we'll hold off
on the magazines awhile.

318
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,700
Anything else?
Fuck you!

319
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:43,670
Fuck all of y'all!

320
00:18:43,670 --> 00:18:46,920
Shit, man!

321
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:50,640
Being locked down
in Segregation...

322
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,610
I couldn't even
get into a good fight...

323
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:54,330
except with words.

324
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:57,300
What the fuck is this shit?
Shakespeare?!

325
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:59,930
Which kept the guy next to me
sane, but drove me crazy.
Fuck!

326
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:00,930
Yeah!

327
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:02,430
Fuck!

328
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:06,270
Fuck!

329
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:08,860
Fuck!

330
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:11,330
Fuck!

331
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:13,310
Don't hurt
yourself, boy.

332
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:27,150
About fucking time,
you cracker motherfucker.

333
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:39,650
Hey, man, I got
something, don't I?

334
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:41,150
Yard time.

335
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:43,650
Fuck off, Peters.

336
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:45,660
It's your time.

337
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:49,160
Hey, could you tell me
what's my time, motherfucker?

338
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:08,180
"Thee...

339
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:10,180
Thou hast refusest..."

340
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:12,180
What the fuck
is this shit?

341
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:20,690
"When in disgrace
with Fortune and men's eyes,

342
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:22,690
"I, all alone...

00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:27,700

my outcast state."

344
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:35,210
Yeah, man, "outcast."

345
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:37,210
Yeah, fuck all
of y'all!

346
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:38,210
What?

347
00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:39,210
Shut up, Upchurch!

348
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:41,210
Fuck you!

349
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:47,700
All done down here.

350
00:22:03,770 --> 00:22:06,270
"Sonnet 29."

351
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:08,770
29... 29...

352
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:16,280
"When in disgrace...

353
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:20,780
...with Fortune and men's eyes,

354
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:25,290
I, all alone,
beweep my outcast state."

355
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:31,290
Goddamn.

356
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:40,290
"Desiring this man's art,
and that man's scope

357
00:22:40,290 --> 00:22:44,790

358
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:52,300
"Yet, in these thoughts,
myself..."

359
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:05,310
"...myself almost despising."

360
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:11,540
Say, man...

361
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:13,540
what's a lark?

362
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:15,540
I think
it's a Buick.

363
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:17,510
No, the bird,
motherfucker.

364
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:19,010
What kind of a bird
is a lark?

365
00:23:23,510 --> 00:23:26,520
Shit.

366
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:29,020
Stupid motherfucker.

367
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:32,130
A dictionary,
motherfucker.

368
00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:37,130
Get the fuck
out of here.

369
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:43,130
Lark... lark... lark...
lark... lark...

370
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:50,140
"A singing bird.

371
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:52,640
Ground-living; meadowlark..."

372
00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:01,650
"Like to the lark
at break of day

373
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:04,150
arising from sullen earth."

374
00:24:12,730 --> 00:24:15,230
"Like to the lark

375
00:24:15,730 --> 00:24:17,730
at break of day, arising"...

376
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,970
Here it is.

377
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:23,690
As you requested.

378
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:42,140
:
Look at Shakespeare.

379
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:44,140
Whoo.

380
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:52,000
I'm gonna beat your ass
to death, Ledford!

381
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:53,720
Whoo-hoo-hoo, what's
the matter, Upchurch?

382
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:54,720
You ashamed or something?

383
00:24:56,710 --> 00:24:57,690
Wait'll y'all hear this.

384
00:24:57,690 --> 00:24:59,680
It seems that the
good old chaplain

385
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,660
ain't down here trying
to save Upchurch's soul.

386
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:02,660
Oh, no, sir!

387
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:04,160
The two lovebirds
are down here

388
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:07,290
reading Shakespeare
together.

389
00:25:08,770 --> 00:25:10,270
Shakespeare

390
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:11,740
taking it in the rear.

391
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:13,740
And Upchurch
is giving it to him.

392
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:16,730
I'm gonna kill you, no matter
how long it takes, Ledford!

393
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:18,460
You're already
killing me, Upchurch.

394
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:22,430
I'm dying of laughter here,
you bookworm motherfucker!

395
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:28,990
Shut up, motherfuckers! Shut up!

396
00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:31,940
Hey, Church...

397
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:33,530
you read that shit for real?

398
00:25:33,530 --> 00:25:35,530
You fuck off, T-Bone,
or I'll kill

399
00:25:35,530 --> 00:25:37,000
your big ass next.

400
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,730
Fuck you and Shakespeare!

401
00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:41,200
I said shut the fuck up!

402
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:44,960
Straight up, man.

403
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,590
Read us some.

404
00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:48,070
Hey, Shakespeare's a queer.

405
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,050
I said shut the fuck up!

406
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:52,010
Now you trippin',
big nigger.

407
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:54,000
I really want
to hear this.

408
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:04,420
Yeah, all right.

409
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:10,430
This is a poem called
"Sonnet 29."

410
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:20,920
"When in disgrace with
Fortune and men's eyes

411
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,930
"I, all alone,
beweep my outcast state

412
00:26:24,930 --> 00:26:28,430
"And trouble deaf heaven
with my bootless cries

413
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:30,930
"And look upon myself
and curse my fate...

414
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:37,370
"Wishing me like to one more
rich in hope

415
00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:39,880
"Featured like him

416
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:42,850
"Like him with friends possessed

417
00:26:42,850 --> 00:26:46,320
"Desiring this man's art
and that man's scope

418
00:26:47,570 --> 00:26:50,540
With what I most enjoy,
contented least..."

419
00:26:52,770 --> 00:26:54,770
The party's over, Upchurch.

420
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:56,750
Shit! Fuck you!

421
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,730
Damn it, I was
almost asleep!

422
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:10,820
"Yet, in these thoughts

423
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:13,830
"my self almost despising

424
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:16,800
"Haply I think on thee

425
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:20,280
"and then my state

426
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:23,270
"Like to the lark,
at break of day, arising

427
00:27:23,270 --> 00:27:24,870
"from sullen earth

428
00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:28,880
"sings hymns at heaven's gate.

429
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:35,500
"For thy sweet love remembered,
such wealth brings

430
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:42,010
That then I scorn to change
my state with kings."

431
00:27:45,490 --> 00:27:46,990
Damn, Church.

432
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:16,120
Hey, Upchurch...

433
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:18,340
read that part about
her titties again

434
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:19,840
'fore I go.

435
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,340
Say, fuck you, Ledford.

436
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:23,860
A little knowledge
wouldn't hurt your ignorant ass

437
00:28:23,850 --> 00:28:26,350
you comic-book-reading,
corn-fed redneck.

438
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:28,070
Damn, Church

439
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:30,050
you say the woman's a sister?

440
00:28:30,050 --> 00:28:31,040
How you know that?

441
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:33,040
It's right there, Jerome.

442
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:36,540
"If snow be white,
why then her breasts are dun."

443
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:39,500
I already told you
dun means brown.

444
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:41,980
"If hair be wires, then black
wires grow on her head."

445
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:43,980
Man, brown breasts
and wiry hair--

446
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:45,990
you tell me what color
that stuff is.

447
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:47,490
Sounds like brown sugar to me.

448
00:28:47,490 --> 00:28:50,990
You just keep on reading
about them titties, Upchurch.

449
00:28:50,990 --> 00:28:53,490
You keep on dreaming
about 'em, Jerome

450
00:28:53,490 --> 00:28:54,340
'cause old Ledford here

451
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:56,350
he's going to go out
and find himself

452
00:28:56,350 --> 00:28:58,820
some real ones.

453
00:28:59,930 --> 00:29:00,930
Knock off a piece for me.

454
00:29:00,930 --> 00:29:03,390
We'll see you soon, white trash.

455
00:29:03,390 --> 00:29:06,370
They say "knowledge is power."
Absolutely.

456
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:07,790
Man gets ahold
of the right idea,

457
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:09,790
it can inspire him
to change his life.

458
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:12,800
Or at least help him figure out
why things are so fucked up.

459
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:15,300
What you looking
at, fuck-face?

460
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:17,300
Shh. Third period,
literature.

461
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:20,300
"...the more glorious
the triumph

462
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:22,310
"And it would be
strange indeed

463
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:25,290
"if so celestial an article

464
00:29:25,290 --> 00:29:29,800
as Freedom should
not be highly rated."

465
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:32,280
Gather your personals.

466
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:34,770
You're out of segregation.

467
00:29:34,770 --> 00:29:38,770
What, a year in here
isn't long enough?

468
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:48,770
Lucky for me, somewhere
back in my childhood

469
00:29:48,770 --> 00:29:50,270
I learned to like reading

470
00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:52,740
in spite of
all the other bullshit.

471
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:55,740
When I stumbled on it
this time, it saved my life.

472
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:03,550
I gained power

473
00:30:03,550 --> 00:30:06,400
from the African-American
writers of the 1920s,

474
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:11,370
the Harlem Renaissance,
contemporary black writers...

475
00:30:11,370 --> 00:30:15,880
Baldwin, Angelou, Charles
Johnson, Charles Gordone.

476
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:23,480
You know, jack some
stuff, make some bread.

477
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:28,490
Be nice to say I never
revisited old habits.

478
00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:30,720
But I did.

479
00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:38,730
What the fuck you doing?

480
00:30:38,730 --> 00:30:39,730
Huh?

481
00:30:39,730 --> 00:30:41,230
Motherfucker!

482
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:42,240
What the fuck you...

483
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,740
What the fuck you
talking about?

484
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:49,710
Motherfucker!

485
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:06,860
For the first time in my
prison life, I felt remorse.

486
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:10,860
It hit me hard that I piped
a man over basically nothing.

487
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:13,870
He almost died.

488
00:31:14,370 --> 00:31:18,370
Eggs for a Mafia nigger.

489
00:31:18,370 --> 00:31:21,880
I was acting exactly
as I was expected to act...

490
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:25,880
as a lowdown, ignorant,
nigger criminal.

491
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:28,880
I knew I didn't want
to be that anymore.

492
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:40,840
Upchurch, hold it.

493
00:31:44,850 --> 00:31:47,850
Whatever you've done,
I don't want to know

494
00:31:47,850 --> 00:31:49,850
and you don't
want to tell me.

495
00:31:49,850 --> 00:31:53,360
Not today anyway.

496
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:58,860
...and so it is the conclusion
of this board

497
00:31:58,860 --> 00:31:59,850
that, pending parole...

498
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:02,250
you be released
to a halfway house facility.

499
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:05,750
Congratulations, Mr. Upchurch.

500
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:08,220
To which locality
do you wish to report?

501
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:11,320
Philadelphia.

502
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:15,450
In my cell, I had the solitude
to study and think

503
00:32:15,450 --> 00:32:18,800
and picture a life for myself.

504
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,420
Back on the streets,

505
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:24,920
reality was nobody wanted
to hire an ex-con

506
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:27,420
with no real skills.

507
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:28,930
To make matters worse

508
00:32:28,930 --> 00:32:33,430
I made the same damn mistake
a lot of ex-cons make.

509
00:32:33,430 --> 00:32:37,930
I went to my old environment,
without a solid plan.

510
00:32:40,850 --> 00:32:42,860
Shit, man, they make you wait
six months

511
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:43,860
for a job training program.

512
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:46,830
Man, look, you listen to Bo now.

513
00:32:47,330 --> 00:32:50,330
You ain't no
minimum-wage nigger.

514
00:32:50,330 --> 00:32:55,850
What you need is a score,
get you back on your feet.

515
00:32:55,850 --> 00:32:59,840
I'm ready.

516
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:03,410
You ready for some
hard prison time, Bo?

517
00:33:03,410 --> 00:33:05,910
Hmm, prison.

518
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:10,900
Hey, look, man, I'm just trying

519
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:13,400
to get out this motherfucker
and live straight.

520
00:33:14,770 --> 00:33:16,770
Nigger, you
fuck up my hide.

521
00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:19,280
Nigger, you
can't do straight.

522
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:22,280
I mean, shit...

523
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:25,280
Motherfucker, look, that's like
my skinny ass flying.

524
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:29,870
Look, man,
this your shit right here.

525
00:33:29,870 --> 00:33:32,360
South Street.

526
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:34,360
You the king.

527
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:37,340
King, motherfucker.

528
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:40,810
Shit, man,
who you talking to?

529
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:43,300
Here... here.

530
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,800
Welcome home, brother.

531
00:34:21,250 --> 00:34:22,760
Help me out, man.

532
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,260
Got a quarter?

533
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:40,760
What the fuck is this?

534
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:44,210
Shit.

535
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:48,210
That's right, old man.

536
00:34:48,210 --> 00:34:50,220
That's exactly right.

537
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:53,320
Put the money
in the bag, bitch

538
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:54,800
or I'll blow
your fucking head off.

539
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,310
Hurry up.

540
00:34:56,310 --> 00:34:59,280
Hurry up, bitch,
this ain't no joke!

541
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,260
Move!

542
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:06,220
Move, move, move, move, move!

543
00:35:08,970 --> 00:35:10,470
Shit!

544
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:12,790
Pull over, Bo.

545
00:35:12,790 --> 00:35:14,290
I can lose these
motherfuckers!

546
00:35:21,830 --> 00:35:23,300
Fuck it, man.

547
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:24,520
Fuck, man.

548
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:26,340
We ain't going to make it,
man, pull over!

549
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:27,470
No way!
I can't do time, man!

550
00:35:27,470 --> 00:35:29,110
I can't do time!

551
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:38,180
Watch out, watch out!

552
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:40,030
Oh, shit!

553
00:35:40,030 --> 00:35:41,370
Oh! Ah!

554
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,830
Motherfuckers better
straighten that line.

555
00:35:56,830 --> 00:36:00,820
I'm going to talk to you,
brother.

556
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:02,790
About a proposition.

557
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:13,870
Damn.

558
00:36:13,870 --> 00:36:15,950
Carl Upchurch.

559
00:36:15,950 --> 00:36:16,920
I heard you got out.

560
00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:19,900
Yeah, me too.

561
00:36:19,890 --> 00:36:21,370
Ain't this a bitch.

562
00:36:21,370 --> 00:36:23,380
When'd you learn to read, Dumbo?

563
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:24,380
Read?

564
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:26,380
Hell, I'm doing college.

565
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:28,900
Shit, you jiving, man!

566
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:30,400
Oh, yeah, well,
the judge suggested

567
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,900
I improve my prospects.

568
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:32,900
There wasn't no future

569
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:34,900
in investing beer money
in biker bars

570
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:36,390
selling coke to narcs.

571
00:36:36,390 --> 00:36:37,390
How?

572
00:36:37,390 --> 00:36:38,860
A GED and a grant.

573
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:42,860
Beats the hell out of
a shitty job like this.

574
00:36:43,850 --> 00:36:46,820
Check it out, bubba.

575
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:48,820
Shakespeare.

576
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:55,410
Come on.

577
00:36:55,410 --> 00:36:58,900
First thing we're gonna to
do is lay some bread down

578
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:01,900
get that motherfucker
transferred over.

579
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:03,400
Then when he get here

580
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:06,900
we gonna go ahead
and snatch his
whole operation.

581
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:09,410
Just take it, huh?

582
00:37:09,410 --> 00:37:11,410
Oh, yeah, that's
where you come in.

583
00:37:11,410 --> 00:37:13,410
Word is you're
very convincing.

584
00:37:15,410 --> 00:37:16,910
You want me to dust him.

585
00:37:16,910 --> 00:37:19,420
All I'm saying is don't
nobody give a shit

586
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:21,420
about a dead
nigger dope dealer.

587
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:23,150
Plus you can
get up on him

588
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:25,140
because you don't belong
to nobody.

589
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:30,110
...'cause Shakespeare...
is a horny motherfucker.

590
00:37:30,110 --> 00:37:32,610
Look, man, we can
control all the
shit coming in here,

591
00:37:32,610 --> 00:37:34,110
you know what
I'm talking about?

592
00:37:34,110 --> 00:37:37,470
Smack... reefer...

593
00:37:38,970 --> 00:37:40,590
Blow.

594
00:37:42,090 --> 00:37:45,070
My boys got your back.

595
00:37:45,070 --> 00:37:47,580
So what you saying,
lone wolf?

596
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:50,580
You in or what?

597
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:55,100
Why couldn't God

598
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:56,600
have created
the Big Bang?

599
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:59,610
What is this Sunday School
bullshit?

600
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:01,610
Supposed to be Physics class.

601
00:38:01,610 --> 00:38:02,610
My point is...

602
00:38:03,110 --> 00:38:05,710
Carl... that even scientists

603
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:07,710
need to keep an open mind.

604
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,680
Why do science
and religion have
to conflict?

605
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,650
Uh, Mrs. Conamacher,

606
00:38:11,650 --> 00:38:14,250
I believe that you're too smart
to believe in all that

607
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:16,760
Virgin Mary, Jesus,
walking-on-water crap.

608
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:20,260
Yes, but isn't that exactly
what faith is about, Carl?

609
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:23,260
Belief in a truth
that cannot be explained.

610
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:25,260
I can explain Christianity.
It's bullshit.

611
00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:26,780
Amen.

612
00:38:26,770 --> 00:38:29,270
You got your white Virgin Mary,
you got your white Jesus.

613
00:38:29,270 --> 00:38:31,250
It's a white man's tool

614
00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:33,260
for making
brown people slaves.

615
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:34,760
Always has been.

616
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:36,260
That's right.

617
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:37,260
First of all,

618
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:39,230
Jesus and Mary
were not Caucasian, Carl.

619
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:40,730
And if you think

620
00:38:40,730 --> 00:38:43,220
it's just a white
man's religion...

621
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:44,180
You know what?

622
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:46,190
I'm going to bring in some books
to show you.

623
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:48,170
I would be very interested
in your reaction.

624
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:07,010
At first glance,
Martha Conamacher seemed

625
00:39:07,010 --> 00:39:09,010
like so many
of the teachers I had known,

626
00:39:09,010 --> 00:39:12,500
and I wanted to dismiss her

627
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:15,480
as just another self-righteous
bully with a book.

628
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:17,980
But something in her eyes
was different.

629
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:20,490
She was... there.

630
00:39:20,490 --> 00:39:22,990
And I was never one
to back down from a challenge.

631
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:31,110
Africa.

632
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:33,100
Damn.

633
00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:00,030
Don't forget that
paper, Christian.

634
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:08,520
I read your books.

635
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:11,490
All of them?

636
00:40:13,470 --> 00:40:15,490
And?

637
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:18,960
And, uh...

638
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:21,460
I was wrong
about some shit.

639
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:23,470
You can't be wrong
about something
you didn't know.

640
00:40:23,470 --> 00:40:24,470
You could be ignorant.

641
00:40:24,470 --> 00:40:26,940
Hey, hey, don't be
calling me ignorant.

642
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:28,940
Ignorant just means
that you weren't aware.

643
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,940
Oh, but I'm very aware

644
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:32,440
of the quote-unquote
"white" Christianity

645
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:33,940
that comes
from the Christianity

646
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:35,950
I just learned
was rooted in Africa.

647
00:40:35,950 --> 00:40:37,450
I'm also very aware...

648
00:40:38,450 --> 00:40:40,450
...that the white
version was used
as a tool to conquer.

649
00:40:40,450 --> 00:40:42,920
It's like they
sent the clergy in

650
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:43,920
to soften them up.

651
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,920
Then they sent the army in
to beat them up.

652
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,920
Then they let the clergy
back loose on them

653
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:48,920
to keep them humble

654
00:40:49,410 --> 00:40:51,390
and well-behaved.

655
00:40:51,390 --> 00:40:53,900
That white version
was used big time

656
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:54,900
to keep
the slaves in line.

657
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:59,890
Of course, that's coming
from my "ignorant" perspective.

658
00:41:02,390 --> 00:41:03,890
You make good points.

659
00:41:03,890 --> 00:41:05,360
I can tell
we're going

660
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:07,310
to have very
challenging discussions.

661
00:41:07,310 --> 00:41:08,810
I look forward to it.

662
00:41:08,810 --> 00:41:09,810
See you next week.

663
00:41:09,810 --> 00:41:11,280
Wait. Hold on.

664
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,780
I ain't finished talking
this week.

665
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:14,250
The Society
of Friends

666
00:41:14,250 --> 00:41:15,250
is another name
for Quakers.

667
00:41:15,250 --> 00:41:16,750
You're a Quaker?

668
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:20,230
No, no, no.

669
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:24,230
The Amish are
the bonnet and buggy people.

670
00:41:24,710 --> 00:41:25,830
We Quakers are very sneaky.

671
00:41:25,830 --> 00:41:28,330
We go around looking
just like everybody else.

672
00:41:29,830 --> 00:41:31,830
I suppose what
distinguishes Quakers

673
00:41:31,830 --> 00:41:35,190
is we believe that
there's a divinity--

674
00:41:35,190 --> 00:41:37,690
a piece of God--
in all of us.

675
00:41:37,690 --> 00:41:40,190
We call it
"the light within."

676
00:41:40,190 --> 00:41:42,190
:
Shit.

677
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:44,810
Mrs. Conamacher,
you believe that

678
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:47,800
there's a light
within these mother...

679
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,300
these convicts?

680
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,810
Yeah, I do.

681
00:41:54,310 --> 00:41:56,310
Shit. Well,
I'll tell you what.

682
00:41:56,310 --> 00:42:00,310
I see a lot of
burnt-out bulbs
around here myself.

683
00:42:00,310 --> 00:42:01,810
Well, I didn't
say it was easy

684
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:03,820
to find the divinity.

685
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:07,820
Sometimes you got
to find their humanity first.

686
00:42:41,550 --> 00:42:43,060
Church.

687
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:44,560
Ledford.

688
00:42:56,570 --> 00:42:58,070
That your house?

689
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:01,440
Yes, sir.

690
00:43:08,950 --> 00:43:11,450
I got to stop
this shit, Carl.

691
00:43:13,950 --> 00:43:16,460
Some way,
somehow, I got to.

692
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:22,960
Yeah, me, too.

693
00:43:36,390 --> 00:43:38,360
Get back! Come on!

694
00:43:39,350 --> 00:43:40,480
Come on!

695
00:43:44,150 --> 00:43:46,120
That's it!

696
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:47,620
Hey, motherfucker!

697
00:43:47,620 --> 00:43:49,590
What, punk?

698
00:43:49,590 --> 00:43:52,320
You better cut that shit.

699
00:43:54,310 --> 00:43:55,310
Get him, Church!

700
00:43:59,050 --> 00:44:01,420
Put it on him now!

701
00:44:01,420 --> 00:44:03,420
Yeah, you're right,
brother.

702
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:04,920
I charged you.

703
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:06,420
No basket.

704
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:07,910
Oh, you gonna
let him

705
00:44:07,910 --> 00:44:09,380
get away with that, dawg?

706
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:11,630
What the fuck y'all looking at?
Come on.

707
00:44:11,630 --> 00:44:13,610
All right, let's go.

708
00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:17,780
Martha,
I'm only alive

709
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:19,790
because everybody
knows what happens

710
00:44:19,790 --> 00:44:20,790
if you fuck with Church.

711
00:44:20,790 --> 00:44:23,270
Now, what's
going to happen

712
00:44:23,270 --> 00:44:26,260
if I try to change the rules?
Hmm?

713
00:44:26,260 --> 00:44:28,730
I've seen how men
respect you here.

714
00:44:28,730 --> 00:44:30,230
They fear me.

715
00:44:30,230 --> 00:44:32,230
So? You might be the one man

716
00:44:32,230 --> 00:44:35,730
who can show them
that the rules can change.

717
00:44:35,740 --> 00:44:38,250
That there's
a better way to live.

718
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:41,220
Maybe it's the light within you.

719
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:44,210
There you go
condescending again.

720
00:44:44,210 --> 00:44:45,680
No.

721
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:49,680
I'm telling you the truth.

722
00:44:59,630 --> 00:45:01,380
Bullshit, Carl.

723
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:03,380
It's bullshit.

724
00:45:03,380 --> 00:45:06,350
I don't care what
Martha Cona-wanna-wacher says.

725
00:45:06,350 --> 00:45:07,850
A man's nature has
a lot more to do

726
00:45:07,850 --> 00:45:10,840
with him ending up in here
than his environment--

727
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:11,820
nurturing or not.

728
00:45:11,820 --> 00:45:13,820
You are what you are, bubba.

729
00:45:13,820 --> 00:45:14,820
Then why
the hell are you

730
00:45:14,820 --> 00:45:17,310
even bothering to study for,
then, Ledford?

731
00:45:17,310 --> 00:45:19,810
You're a walking example
against your own argument.

732
00:45:19,810 --> 00:45:21,310
No, no. We are both
a walking example

733
00:45:21,310 --> 00:45:22,310
for my argument.

734
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:23,830
You and I are here

735
00:45:23,820 --> 00:45:25,320
because of our
criminal natures.

736
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:26,320
The only
difference is

737
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:27,320
I refuse
to blame that shit

738
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:28,820
on anything
but what I am.

739
00:45:28,820 --> 00:45:30,810
You are a nigger, man.

740
00:45:30,810 --> 00:45:33,290
What?
You've been taught
that it's your nature

741
00:45:33,790 --> 00:45:34,290
to end up in jail

742
00:45:34,790 --> 00:45:35,780
and you've accepted it.

743
00:45:35,780 --> 00:45:37,280
That is niggerization.

744
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:38,780
You been niggerized,
my man.

745
00:45:38,780 --> 00:45:40,770
Zap! Ledford's
a nigger now.

746
00:45:40,770 --> 00:45:42,250
But, see, you're trying
to nurture yourself.

747
00:45:42,250 --> 00:45:44,250
Therefore, you're trying
to get "de-niggerized,"

748
00:45:44,250 --> 00:45:45,750
and that's really
all the fuck I'm talking about.

749
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:47,250
You know damn well

750
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:49,240
these motherfuckers would
have ended up assholes

751
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:50,740
no matter where
they grew up--

752
00:45:50,740 --> 00:45:51,740
niggers and whites.

753
00:45:51,740 --> 00:45:53,250
Yeah, but I bet you some
of these motherfuckers

754
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:55,250
would have been running
Fortune 500 companies.

755
00:45:55,250 --> 00:45:57,580
Writers,
lawyers, doctors.

756
00:45:57,580 --> 00:45:59,080
Who knows what they'd have been
if they wouldn't

757
00:45:59,090 --> 00:46:00,600
have been niggerized
and just remained assholes?

758
00:46:00,590 --> 00:46:03,070
What the hell are
you talking about, Carl?

759
00:46:03,070 --> 00:46:04,540
In a nurturing
environment

760
00:46:04,540 --> 00:46:06,040
with a good education

761
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:07,540
I bet you,
from the git

762
00:46:07,540 --> 00:46:09,550
half of these
motherfuckers

763
00:46:09,550 --> 00:46:11,050
wouldn't
even be here--

764
00:46:11,050 --> 00:46:13,050
white niggers
and black niggers.

765
00:46:13,050 --> 00:46:15,880
Motherfucker,
quit calling me a nigger!

766
00:46:15,890 --> 00:46:18,380
You're niggerized,
so you're a nigger, man.

767
00:46:18,870 --> 00:46:19,990
You and that
new teacher

768
00:46:19,990 --> 00:46:20,970
friend of yours
got your heads

769
00:46:21,470 --> 00:46:22,470
so far up
your fucking asses...

770
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:24,490
This is a thesis
I'm working on.

771
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:25,980
It's fucking stupid.

772
00:46:25,980 --> 00:46:27,480
Well, you're
a dumb nigger

773
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:28,480
and you don't know it.

774
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:29,470
Kill him, Church!

775
00:46:29,470 --> 00:46:31,470
Shut up, nigger!

776
00:46:31,470 --> 00:46:32,970
Hey, asshole!

777
00:46:36,090 --> 00:46:38,070
We're talking.

778
00:46:39,530 --> 00:46:40,530
Y'all clear out

779
00:46:40,530 --> 00:46:42,510
before we get busted.

780
00:46:42,510 --> 00:46:43,510
Beat it! Beat it!

781
00:46:43,510 --> 00:46:45,730
Yo, back off!

782
00:46:45,730 --> 00:46:48,200
Just talking.
It's cool.

783
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:49,700
No fight.
Dumb niggers.

784
00:46:57,680 --> 00:46:59,680
You had enough?

785
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:01,660
And so it is...

786
00:47:02,530 --> 00:47:04,530
...with great pride
that I present

787
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:07,540
the Bachelor of Science and Arts
graduates for 1981.

788
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:10,540
Whoa!

789
00:47:10,540 --> 00:47:12,040
All right!

790
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:13,540
Whoa!

791
00:47:13,540 --> 00:47:15,540
Yeah, Daddy!

792
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:36,970
Graduate school?

793
00:47:36,970 --> 00:47:38,470
It's a Quaker college
in Indiana

794
00:47:38,470 --> 00:47:40,470
and the dean's
a friend of mine.

795
00:47:40,470 --> 00:47:42,470
He can arrange
a scholarship for you.

796
00:47:42,470 --> 00:47:43,970
I don't think so.

797
00:47:43,970 --> 00:47:45,470
Keep it.

798
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:50,980
Carl...

799
00:47:50,980 --> 00:47:54,950
I want you to know
how proud I am of you.

800
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:10,900
Thanks.

801
00:48:54,930 --> 00:48:57,430
What the hell
is wrong with you?

802
00:48:57,430 --> 00:48:59,430
You got a hearing
next month.

803
00:48:59,430 --> 00:49:01,430
I always fuck up
on the outside.

804
00:49:01,430 --> 00:49:03,440
You see,
it's in my nature

805
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:04,940
to try to cop
the big score.

806
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:10,440
Listen.

807
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:12,950
Let's not ever meet
back here again.

808
00:49:14,450 --> 00:49:16,450
Ever.

809
00:49:16,450 --> 00:49:20,450
No excuses like,
"It's in my nature,"
either, you punk.

810
00:49:20,450 --> 00:49:22,450
Kiss my ass, lifer.

811
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:24,470
You just try not
to come back here

812
00:49:24,460 --> 00:49:25,960
before I get out.

813
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:03,950
You can go.

814
00:50:08,070 --> 00:50:10,070
I got to use the phone.

815
00:50:13,820 --> 00:50:15,170
Carl, watch out!

816
00:50:15,170 --> 00:50:16,680
Whoa! Hey! Whoa!

817
00:50:18,180 --> 00:50:20,430
What's his problem?

818
00:50:20,910 --> 00:50:23,030
He's a mean one.
Really mean.

819
00:50:24,030 --> 00:50:25,530
Uh-huh.

820
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:28,020
Come on, let's go.

821
00:50:28,020 --> 00:50:30,020
We'll get
some coffee.

822
00:50:38,030 --> 00:50:40,530
Hey, hey, hey! Whoa!

823
00:50:40,530 --> 00:50:42,650
We want you
to know, Carl

824
00:50:42,650 --> 00:50:44,650
that you can stay here
as long as you need to.

825
00:50:44,650 --> 00:50:47,160
Yeah, we could
use your help
around the farm.

826
00:50:55,350 --> 00:50:58,350
We adopted the boys
when they were babies.

827
00:50:58,350 --> 00:51:02,350
I'm afraid William's
had an easier time
of it than Demetrius.

828
00:51:05,860 --> 00:51:08,360
You know, you're
probably the first
adult black man

829
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:09,860
they've been around.

830
00:51:09,860 --> 00:51:14,350
Martha, Bob, I'm no role model.

831
00:51:14,350 --> 00:51:17,320
You don't have to perform.

832
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:18,820
Just be yourself.

833
00:52:11,220 --> 00:52:12,220
Hey, Jim.

834
00:52:12,220 --> 00:52:13,610
Morning, Martha.

835
00:52:13,610 --> 00:52:14,610
Is everything all right?

836
00:52:14,610 --> 00:52:16,610
Yeah, just passing by.

837
00:52:16,610 --> 00:52:18,110
Everybody okay here?

838
00:52:18,110 --> 00:52:19,610
Yeah, we're great.

839
00:52:19,620 --> 00:52:21,630
Uh, Carl Upchurch, I'd like
you to meet Sheriff Stark.

840
00:52:21,620 --> 00:52:23,600
Morning, Sheriff.

841
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:27,110
Upchurch, yeah,
I heard about you.

842
00:52:27,110 --> 00:52:29,090
You related
to the boys?

843
00:52:29,090 --> 00:52:30,090
Which boys?

844
00:52:30,090 --> 00:52:31,590
Carl's helping out
on the farm.

845
00:52:31,590 --> 00:52:32,830
That's nice.

846
00:52:32,830 --> 00:52:35,330
How's... how's Mary Beth?

847
00:52:35,330 --> 00:52:37,700
Oh, she's fine...
fine, thank you.

848
00:52:37,700 --> 00:52:38,700
Good.

849
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:40,200
Well, give her my best,
will you?

850
00:52:40,690 --> 00:52:44,310
Yeah, you bet I will, mm-hmm.

851
00:52:44,310 --> 00:52:46,160
I'm gonna, uh,
heat this up.

852
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:48,160
Would you like a cup
of coffee, Sheriff?

853
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:49,630
No, thank you.

854
00:52:49,630 --> 00:52:50,630
You make that?

855
00:52:50,630 --> 00:52:52,630
Is that what you do here,
Carl, you cook?

856
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:56,620
And pick the cotton.

857
00:53:08,300 --> 00:53:10,300
Martha, have you seen
his record?

858
00:53:10,300 --> 00:53:13,800
I know everything
I need to know, Jim.

859
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:15,290
Do you?

860
00:53:15,290 --> 00:53:17,790
Do you know how many calls we've
gotten since he got here?

861
00:53:17,790 --> 00:53:20,760
We have had two calls
from his parole officer.

862
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:23,210
We got another call from
Philadelphia PD

863
00:53:23,210 --> 00:53:25,210
for God's sakes,
"just checking in."

864
00:53:25,210 --> 00:53:28,200
This man is beyond
rehabilitation.

865
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:31,700
He needs to be watched
very, very carefully.

866
00:53:31,700 --> 00:53:33,210
You have children here.

867
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:37,180
I know everything
I need to know.

868
00:53:37,180 --> 00:53:38,680
You have a nice day.

869
00:53:47,940 --> 00:53:51,420
So this is where you're
always sneaking off to?

870
00:53:51,420 --> 00:53:53,430
Don't tell anyone
about this place.

871
00:53:53,430 --> 00:53:54,930
It's your spot?

872
00:53:56,930 --> 00:53:57,930
Where's William?

873
00:53:57,930 --> 00:54:00,930
He likes to hang out
with his buddies.

874
00:54:00,930 --> 00:54:03,940
I like to come here
and watch the river.

875
00:54:03,940 --> 00:54:06,940
It's a nice spot.

876
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:10,930
Did you like robbing banks?

877
00:54:14,410 --> 00:54:16,410
I guess I did, in a way.

878
00:54:16,420 --> 00:54:19,410
It was the only way
I knew how to get money.

879
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:21,900
Now I know better.

880
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:24,410
So you ain't gonna rob
and steal no more?

881
00:54:24,410 --> 00:54:26,020
"Anymore."

882
00:54:27,530 --> 00:54:30,030
And no, I don't expect
to be robbing and stealing.

883
00:54:30,030 --> 00:54:33,030
Of course we won't talk
about the robbing and stealing

884
00:54:33,030 --> 00:54:35,030
that created some
of those banks.

885
00:54:36,270 --> 00:54:37,870
That's another conversation

886
00:54:37,870 --> 00:54:39,870
when you're older,
young brother.

887
00:54:39,870 --> 00:54:42,220
I'll put it to you
this way--

888
00:54:42,220 --> 00:54:43,440
the black folks
didn't start here

889
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:45,940
and the Indians didn't start out
on the reservation.

890
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:52,400
Man, let's keep it simple
for now.

891
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:54,400
Let's enjoy this fine day
we got here.

892
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:55,900
Let's catch us some fish.

893
00:54:55,900 --> 00:54:58,410
I'm hungry.

894
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:03,160
Is this right?

895
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:04,660
Try again.

896
00:55:04,660 --> 00:55:05,660
...Democrats on Capitol Hill

897
00:55:05,660 --> 00:55:07,170
are vowing to fight
the tax package

898
00:55:07,170 --> 00:55:08,170
despite the poll's results.

899
00:55:08,170 --> 00:55:10,540
And turning to our cities

900
00:55:10,540 --> 00:55:13,040
the FBI reports a sharp rise in
violent crime

901
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:14,770
especially among
inner city blacks.

902
00:55:14,770 --> 00:55:16,780
Black-on-black crime,
much of it in the form

903
00:55:16,780 --> 00:55:18,780
of youth gang violence,
leads all categories.

904
00:55:18,780 --> 00:55:20,900
A Reagan Administration
spokesman blamed

905
00:55:21,410 --> 00:55:24,920
lenient courts and called for
harsher sentencing guidelines.

906
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:41,800
I'm ready.

907
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:02,390
How's the quiche?

908
00:56:02,390 --> 00:56:04,890
Hmm? The what?

909
00:56:04,890 --> 00:56:05,890
The quiche...

910
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:09,830
The quiche.

911
00:56:09,830 --> 00:56:11,830
It's cool for quiche.

912
00:56:15,530 --> 00:56:17,540
Aparth...

913
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:19,000
Apartheid.

914
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,510
Is that a disease
or something?

915
00:56:21,510 --> 00:56:24,010
No, it's a government policy
in South Africa.

916
00:56:24,010 --> 00:56:25,990
Legal segregation
and oppression.

917
00:56:27,350 --> 00:56:28,830
A small white minority

918
00:56:28,830 --> 00:56:31,330
rules a huge majority
black population

919
00:56:31,330 --> 00:56:33,300
by force.

920
00:56:33,300 --> 00:56:35,270
Uh, yeah, a couple years ago
some kids did

921
00:56:35,270 --> 00:56:36,390
a protest thing about that.

922
00:56:36,390 --> 00:56:37,390
Something about Earlham
giving money

923
00:56:37,390 --> 00:56:38,890
to some apartheid country?

924
00:56:38,890 --> 00:56:41,880
One of those countries
in South Africa.

925
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:42,990
South Africa is the country

926
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:43,990
of apartheid.

927
00:56:43,980 --> 00:56:44,950
What did you say

928
00:56:44,950 --> 00:56:46,450
about the protest again?

929
00:56:46,450 --> 00:56:49,930
Uh, I forget--
some business thing.

930
00:56:49,940 --> 00:56:50,910
Investments maybe?

931
00:56:50,900 --> 00:56:52,900
I don't know,
I wasn't really into it.

932
00:56:52,910 --> 00:56:54,380
Hey, Carl

933
00:56:54,370 --> 00:56:55,360
I hope you don't mind

934
00:56:55,360 --> 00:56:56,360
but there's this rumor
floating around

935
00:56:56,860 --> 00:56:57,860
that you spent some time

936
00:56:57,860 --> 00:56:59,860
in prison.

937
00:56:59,860 --> 00:57:01,480
God! What's it like?

938
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:03,480
Tracy...!
I've got to go.

939
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:04,480
What?

940
00:57:05,350 --> 00:57:07,840
I'm dying to know.

941
00:57:11,340 --> 00:57:14,830
"...one of those countries
in South Africa..."

942
00:57:15,690 --> 00:57:17,700
Jerk.

943
00:57:26,150 --> 00:57:27,990
Damn.

944
00:57:27,990 --> 00:57:30,880
Well, I have nothing
to do with this.

945
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:35,380
The Board of Trustees invests
Earlham's endowment fund.

946
00:57:35,380 --> 00:57:39,880
Investing in companies that
profit in South Africa!

947
00:57:39,890 --> 00:57:41,400
You're financing apartheid!

948
00:57:41,390 --> 00:57:43,240
Now, that's... that's
a little strong, Carl.

949
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:45,240
These corporations
are multinational.

950
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:46,740
They profit all
over the world

951
00:57:46,740 --> 00:57:48,090
not just South Africa.

952
00:57:48,090 --> 00:57:51,710
No one here is
condoning apartheid.

953
00:57:51,710 --> 00:57:54,080
No, you're just making
money off of it!

954
00:57:54,080 --> 00:57:56,570
Now, please, Carl, please...

955
00:57:58,540 --> 00:58:00,540
The Board meets in three months.

956
00:58:00,540 --> 00:58:03,040
I'll pass your objections along.

957
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:07,050
Beyond that, there's
really nothing I can do.

958
00:58:08,030 --> 00:58:09,530
Man...

959
00:58:11,670 --> 00:58:14,670
Leave? You've only
been there a few weeks.

960
00:58:14,670 --> 00:58:16,190
Martha, I can't stay here.

961
00:58:16,190 --> 00:58:18,190
These people are hypocrites.

962
00:58:18,190 --> 00:58:21,190
We can hold hands, we can pray,
we can discuss

963
00:58:21,190 --> 00:58:23,190
and we can finance oppression.

964
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:26,940
Well, it sounds to me like
somebody needs to speak up.

965
00:58:26,930 --> 00:58:28,420
Damn it, Martha,
what am I supposed to do?

966
00:58:28,420 --> 00:58:31,900
You think these people give
a damn what I think?

967
00:58:33,660 --> 00:58:35,160
You know what they're doing
right now?

968
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:36,660
Mom, is that Carl?

969
00:58:36,660 --> 00:58:37,890
Wait-Wait a minute.
Demetrius wants to say hi.

970
00:58:38,380 --> 00:58:39,360
Martha, wait...

971
00:58:39,360 --> 00:58:40,860
You know, he's doing so much
better in school.

972
00:58:40,860 --> 00:58:42,100
I think you really helped him.

973
00:58:42,100 --> 00:58:43,980
I'm going to let him
tell you-- hold on.

974
00:58:43,980 --> 00:58:45,480
Martha, wait... Hey!

975
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:47,440
Hey, beat it!
Hey, get out of here!

976
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:48,420
Sorry!

977
00:58:48,420 --> 00:58:50,290
Hi, Carl.

978
00:58:50,290 --> 00:58:52,160
Hey, little brother.

979
00:58:52,410 --> 00:58:54,030
My mom... my mom said you
were leaving school.

980
00:58:54,030 --> 00:58:55,490
Leaving school?

981
00:58:55,490 --> 00:58:57,500
Your mom, she's funny, you know?

982
00:58:57,500 --> 00:58:59,330
No, man, I'm just here

983
00:58:59,330 --> 00:59:00,830
learning stuff just like you.

984
00:59:00,830 --> 00:59:02,830
But you hate it?

985
00:59:02,830 --> 00:59:05,340
Well, it's fun. It's cool.

986
00:59:05,340 --> 00:59:06,820
Would I like it?

987
00:59:06,820 --> 00:59:07,820
Actually...

988
00:59:09,310 --> 00:59:11,810
...you'd love it.

989
00:59:11,810 --> 00:59:12,810
You'd fit right in.

990
00:59:12,810 --> 00:59:13,810
What's so funny?

991
00:59:13,810 --> 00:59:14,810
Nothing.

992
00:59:14,810 --> 00:59:16,310
Mom says I have to get
off the phone.

993
00:59:16,310 --> 00:59:17,320
All right, brother.

994
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:18,820
Will you call me on the weekend?

995
00:59:18,820 --> 00:59:20,570
All right, I'll give you
a call on Saturday.

996
00:59:20,570 --> 00:59:21,570
Okay.

997
00:59:21,570 --> 00:59:22,570
All right. Bye.

998
00:59:22,570 --> 00:59:24,070
Bye.

999
00:59:25,070 --> 00:59:27,080
Are you all right?

1000
00:59:27,080 --> 00:59:29,060
Yeah, I'm fine.

1001
00:59:29,060 --> 00:59:30,780
:
Are you sure?

1002
00:59:30,780 --> 00:59:33,410
Yeah, I got it.

1003
00:59:34,420 --> 00:59:35,770
Pledge week.

1004
00:59:37,390 --> 00:59:38,870
Are you pledging?

1005
00:59:38,870 --> 00:59:40,240
Yeah, right.

1006
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:41,740
Gamma Kappa Rasta Fari.

1007
00:59:44,730 --> 00:59:46,230
How about I help you?

1008
00:59:46,230 --> 00:59:48,210
Rescue you?

1009
00:59:48,210 --> 00:59:49,710
How about that?

1010
00:59:49,710 --> 00:59:52,200
That would be nice.

1011
00:59:56,170 --> 00:59:58,170
I'm Andrea Santoni.

1012
00:59:58,170 --> 01:00:00,160
Carl Upchurch.

1013
01:00:00,160 --> 01:00:01,660
Nice to meet you.

1014
01:00:01,660 --> 01:00:03,160
Nice to meet you.

1015
01:00:03,160 --> 01:00:04,660
So, I'm headed this way.

1016
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:07,880
What are they feeding
these kids?

1017
01:00:09,380 --> 01:00:11,390
There are just
too many children

1018
01:00:11,390 --> 01:00:13,760
that grow up in this
country homeless--

1019
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:15,260
in poverty and in pain,

1020
01:00:15,260 --> 01:00:17,260
and we need to reach them
before their spirits

1021
01:00:17,260 --> 01:00:18,760
are completely broken.

1022
01:00:25,870 --> 01:00:26,870
Sor... I'm sorry.

1023
01:00:26,870 --> 01:00:30,370
I tend to get a
little worked up.

1024
01:00:30,370 --> 01:00:32,870
What do you really know
about the city?

1025
01:00:32,870 --> 01:00:35,590
What do you know
about apartheid?

1026
01:00:35,590 --> 01:00:38,060
What are you doing
talking to me?

1027
01:00:38,060 --> 01:00:39,550
You're not the first black man

1028
01:00:39,550 --> 01:00:40,550
I've ever had

1029
01:00:40,550 --> 01:00:42,020
a conversation
with, okay?

1030
01:00:42,020 --> 01:00:44,020
And I know about
a lot of things.

1031
01:00:44,020 --> 01:00:46,850
My father wrote a book
about Malcolm X.

1032
01:00:47,340 --> 01:00:48,320
Really?

1033
01:00:48,320 --> 01:00:49,810
Yeah, really.

1034
01:00:51,930 --> 01:00:53,930
Wow.

1035
01:00:56,930 --> 01:00:58,930
Let me ask you
something.

1036
01:00:58,930 --> 01:01:00,440
Hmm?

1037
01:01:00,440 --> 01:01:01,440
Have you ever seen this?

1038
01:01:05,020 --> 01:01:11,030
Earlham finances apartheid.

1039
01:01:11,030 --> 01:01:13,030
Apartheid isn't just
some policy

1040
01:01:13,030 --> 01:01:14,030
practiced by evil men

1041
01:01:14,030 --> 01:01:17,520
10,000 miles away.

1042
01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:21,120
As long as Earlham College money
helps fuel corporations

1043
01:01:21,120 --> 01:01:23,120
that sustain
South Africa's economy

1044
01:01:23,120 --> 01:01:27,130
the source of apartheid
is right here, right now!

1045
01:01:27,130 --> 01:01:29,630
And you are all responsible.

1046
01:01:29,630 --> 01:01:31,250
You. You.

1047
01:01:31,250 --> 01:01:31,880
You.

1048
01:01:31,880 --> 01:01:33,230
You. You

1049
01:01:33,240 --> 01:01:34,730
and me!

1050
01:01:36,220 --> 01:01:38,220
Millions--

1051
01:01:38,220 --> 01:01:40,220
millions of African deaths
are on our heads!

1052
01:01:41,710 --> 01:01:44,710
How can we live with that?

1053
01:01:49,700 --> 01:01:51,200
Whoo!

1054
01:01:55,170 --> 01:01:56,670
Right on!

1055
01:02:03,250 --> 01:02:05,750
I never got
this much attention

1056
01:02:05,750 --> 01:02:07,750
without a gun in my hand.

1057
01:02:10,260 --> 01:02:14,000
When Martha suggested I lead,
I'm not sure a protest

1058
01:02:13,990 --> 01:02:16,730
at her Quaker college
is what she had in mind.

1059
01:02:16,730 --> 01:02:18,230
It's not what I had in mind
either.

1060
01:02:18,230 --> 01:02:20,730
But it sure felt good
serving something right.

1061
01:02:20,730 --> 01:02:22,230
Definitely right...

1062
01:02:22,230 --> 01:02:24,240
for the first time in my life.

1063
01:02:24,740 --> 01:02:26,440
So, what are you guys
trying to do here?

1064
01:02:26,440 --> 01:02:29,240
Oh, uh... We've been working
really hard, uh...

1065
01:02:29,640 --> 01:02:32,840
just trying to right the wrongs
in the world, I guess.

1066
01:02:32,840 --> 01:02:34,850
And how's it going?

1067
01:02:34,850 --> 01:02:36,850
Um, it's been
going pretty good.

1068
01:02:36,850 --> 01:02:40,050
Uh, people...
people are reacting.

1069
01:02:41,250 --> 01:02:43,050
Did you call me here
to threaten me?

1070
01:02:43,050 --> 01:02:44,170
Of course not.

1071
01:02:44,170 --> 01:02:45,670
That's bullshit.

1072
01:02:45,670 --> 01:02:48,180
I made my living making
threats, remember?

1073
01:02:48,180 --> 01:02:52,030
But if the college loses
profits, scholarships like yours

1074
01:02:52,030 --> 01:02:53,030
are the first
things they cut.

1075
01:02:53,030 --> 01:02:54,030
That's not a threat?

1076
01:02:54,030 --> 01:02:55,020
I just don't want to see

1077
01:02:55,020 --> 01:02:56,520
a bright future like yours

1078
01:02:56,520 --> 01:02:57,250
sacrificed...

1079
01:02:57,250 --> 01:02:59,250
Cut the bullshit,
Professor Wise.

1080
01:02:59,250 --> 01:03:00,760
Who's pulling your strings?

1081
01:03:02,120 --> 01:03:03,110
Did the dean send you down here

1082
01:03:03,110 --> 01:03:04,610
to talk to me or something?

1083
01:03:04,610 --> 01:03:06,110
Carl, as your friend

1084
01:03:06,610 --> 01:03:08,110
I thought you should know

1085
01:03:08,110 --> 01:03:09,960
how things worked.

1086
01:03:09,970 --> 01:03:11,480
A friend?

1087
01:03:11,470 --> 01:03:13,470
We don't even fucking know
each other.

1088
01:03:13,470 --> 01:03:15,190
You can't shut me up
with a scholarship, either!

1089
01:03:15,190 --> 01:03:17,170
You can take your
fucking scholarship...

1090
01:03:17,170 --> 01:03:18,160
Carl!

1091
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:19,660
...and shove it up
your fucking ass!

1092
01:03:20,660 --> 01:03:22,660
Carl...

1093
01:03:22,660 --> 01:03:25,660
There are better ways
to do this.

1094
01:03:30,520 --> 01:03:32,520
You better decide which world
you want to live in, okay?

1095
01:03:32,520 --> 01:03:34,020
'Cause in this world

1096
01:03:34,020 --> 01:03:35,520
that tough-guy
routine of yours

1097
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:36,520
isn't going to
get you anywhere.

1098
01:03:36,520 --> 01:03:37,530
This isn't
South Street.

1099
01:03:38,030 --> 01:03:40,030
Look, you don't
know shit about me.

1100
01:03:40,030 --> 01:03:42,530
I'm just the loud
celebrity nigger
around here.

1101
01:03:42,530 --> 01:03:45,000
"Carl is our very
own black activist."

1102
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:46,500
Been to jail
and everything.

1103
01:03:46,500 --> 01:03:47,990
Let him yell
about the injustice

1104
01:03:47,990 --> 01:03:49,490
while we feel better
about ourselves.

1105
01:03:49,490 --> 01:03:51,490
So this is about you,
and how you come off?

1106
01:03:51,490 --> 01:03:52,960
Andrea, what
Board of Trustees

1107
01:03:52,960 --> 01:03:54,460
is going to
let a bank robber

1108
01:03:54,460 --> 01:03:56,460
tell them what to
do with their money?

1109
01:03:56,460 --> 01:03:57,910
So you're going to quit?

1110
01:03:58,400 --> 01:03:59,880
I'm the one
that's up there

1111
01:03:59,880 --> 01:04:01,380
looking like
a fucking fool!

1112
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:04,890
Fuck this shit.

1113
01:04:44,510 --> 01:04:46,010
Miss Santoni.

1114
01:04:48,530 --> 01:04:50,530
Mr. Upchurch.

1115
01:04:50,530 --> 01:04:54,520
Shall we enter
and "politely"
convey our concerns?

1116
01:04:56,520 --> 01:04:59,020
Let's kick some ass.

1117
01:05:00,530 --> 01:05:02,500
The trustees
are waiting.

1118
01:05:14,440 --> 01:05:15,440
Congratulations.

1119
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:16,940
Thanks.

1120
01:05:19,910 --> 01:05:22,760
Hey, Carl, what are
you doing tonight?

1121
01:05:22,760 --> 01:05:24,270
Hey, I'm,
uh... studying.

1122
01:05:24,750 --> 01:05:27,230
Congratulations,
Mr. Upchurch.

1123
01:05:27,240 --> 01:05:28,730
Well done.

1124
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:30,220
Thank you.

1125
01:05:30,220 --> 01:05:32,220
Excuse me
for a second?

1126
01:05:32,220 --> 01:05:33,720
Sure.

1127
01:05:39,450 --> 01:05:40,450
Hey.

1128
01:05:40,450 --> 01:05:41,950
Hey.

1129
01:05:43,950 --> 01:05:45,450
We got them.

1130
01:05:45,450 --> 01:05:46,950
We sure did.

1131
01:05:50,730 --> 01:05:52,230
Did I ever
thank you

1132
01:05:52,230 --> 01:05:54,230
for getting up
in my face?

1133
01:05:54,230 --> 01:05:58,230
Yeah, I guess I was
kind of hard on you.

1134
01:06:02,340 --> 01:06:05,220
You know, um...

1135
01:06:05,220 --> 01:06:08,230
you're the only one
here that I trust.

1136
01:06:18,070 --> 01:06:19,070
Sorry.

1137
01:06:19,070 --> 01:06:21,070
It's the champagne.

1138
01:06:23,580 --> 01:06:25,590
Should I get
another glass?

1139
01:06:28,580 --> 01:06:29,700
Your props are
like your reputation.

1140
01:06:30,200 --> 01:06:31,700
Your identity, you know?

1141
01:06:31,700 --> 01:06:35,200
Where you've been,
what you've done.

1142
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:37,710
Who you've jacked.

1143
01:06:37,710 --> 01:06:39,710
You mean resumé.

1144
01:06:39,710 --> 01:06:41,210
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

1145
01:06:41,210 --> 01:06:42,710
Something like that.

1146
01:06:42,710 --> 01:06:44,210
So you got
to have props.

1147
01:06:44,210 --> 01:06:46,210
A man with no props
is insignificant.

1148
01:06:46,210 --> 01:06:47,720
He has no voice.

1149
01:06:47,720 --> 01:06:50,220
But a man
with big props--

1150
01:06:50,220 --> 01:06:52,720
that means he's been
challenged, you know?

1151
01:06:52,720 --> 01:06:55,220
He's taken risks,
and he's survived

1152
01:06:55,220 --> 01:06:56,720
so he's got respect.

1153
01:06:56,720 --> 01:06:59,730
Well, you got
your props today,
Mr. Upchurch.

1154
01:06:59,730 --> 01:07:03,230
Yeah, but so what?

1155
01:07:03,230 --> 01:07:05,730
In the scheme of things...

1156
01:07:06,730 --> 01:07:09,240
I called Martha today
to tell her

1157
01:07:09,240 --> 01:07:11,240
I was coming home
to say good-bye.

1158
01:07:11,240 --> 01:07:13,240
What?

1159
01:07:13,240 --> 01:07:14,980
I've been hiding out
long enough.

1160
01:07:14,980 --> 01:07:15,980
A master's degree

1161
01:07:15,980 --> 01:07:18,710
is just not going to help me
with what I got to do.

1162
01:07:18,710 --> 01:07:20,210
And what's that?

1163
01:07:20,220 --> 01:07:22,710
I'm not sure yet.

1164
01:07:26,670 --> 01:07:28,170
What?

1165
01:07:38,180 --> 01:07:40,680
Moving on would
be harder than I thought

1166
01:07:40,690 --> 01:07:43,200
for a whole bunch of reasons.

1167
01:07:47,990 --> 01:07:51,360
Before going back to Martha's,
I went home to Philly

1168
01:07:51,360 --> 01:07:53,860
even though I knew
I wasn't supposed to.

1169
01:07:53,870 --> 01:07:56,830
I had to go back, look around,

1170
01:07:56,820 --> 01:07:58,820
try to find my mission

1171
01:07:58,820 --> 01:08:01,810
only to discover
that the world was changing.

1172
01:08:01,810 --> 01:08:05,940
The revolutionaries
were dying off.

1173
01:08:05,940 --> 01:08:08,450
The gangsters were taking over.

1174
01:08:11,430 --> 01:08:12,930
Come back here!

1175
01:08:27,280 --> 01:08:28,780
Who's that?

1176
01:08:31,270 --> 01:08:32,990
Oh, that's
a friend of mine.

1177
01:08:32,990 --> 01:08:34,490
Andrea?

1178
01:08:34,490 --> 01:08:35,490
It's Andrea.

1179
01:08:35,490 --> 01:08:37,490
Is that
your girlfriend?
No.

1180
01:08:37,490 --> 01:08:38,880
It's his
girlfriend!

1181
01:08:39,880 --> 01:08:40,880
It's not my girlfriend.

1182
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:42,380
Wait a minute!

1183
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:44,380
Hey, fellas, hold on.

1184
01:08:44,380 --> 01:08:45,880
Boys...

1185
01:08:45,880 --> 01:08:47,380
hold up!

1186
01:08:47,390 --> 01:08:49,900
Hold on, fellas. Hold on.

1187
01:08:49,890 --> 01:08:50,890
Boys!

1188
01:08:50,890 --> 01:08:52,870
What a greeting!

1189
01:08:52,870 --> 01:08:54,210
Are you
his girlfriend?

1190
01:08:54,210 --> 01:08:55,710
Yeah, do you guys kiss?

1191
01:08:57,210 --> 01:08:58,830
Hey.

1192
01:08:58,830 --> 01:08:59,830
"Hey."

1193
01:09:01,330 --> 01:09:01,830
Oh, all right.

1194
01:09:02,330 --> 01:09:03,330
All right,
all right.

1195
01:09:03,330 --> 01:09:05,340
Say good-bye
to Andrea, fellas.

1196
01:09:05,340 --> 01:09:06,840
Good-bye.
Bye.

1197
01:09:08,440 --> 01:09:11,430
Andrea Santoni.
Martha Conamacher.

1198
01:09:11,430 --> 01:09:12,430
Hi.

1199
01:09:12,430 --> 01:09:13,660
I've heard so
much about you.

1200
01:09:13,660 --> 01:09:15,160
Oh, it's very nice
to meet you, too.

1201
01:09:15,160 --> 01:09:19,120
I'm sorry to just drop in,
but I woke up this morning.

1202
01:09:19,120 --> 01:09:21,100
I kind of missed
you, so I thought...

1203
01:09:21,100 --> 01:09:22,600
it's a good day
for a drive.

1204
01:09:22,600 --> 01:09:24,100
Well, make yourself at home

1205
01:09:24,110 --> 01:09:26,620
and, please, stay
as long as you like.

1206
01:09:26,610 --> 01:09:27,610
Thank you.

1207
01:09:34,180 --> 01:09:37,180
This is... It's
so beautiful.

1208
01:09:37,190 --> 01:09:39,200
Sure is.

1209
01:09:39,190 --> 01:09:41,670
Sure is.

1210
01:09:48,260 --> 01:09:50,260
She invited you to stay.

1211
01:09:50,260 --> 01:09:52,770
Yeah. Did she mean it?

1212
01:09:52,770 --> 01:09:55,270
Uh...

1213
01:09:56,770 --> 01:09:59,270
I don't think she
meant it in that way.

1214
01:10:10,280 --> 01:10:11,790
Mmm...

1215
01:10:15,290 --> 01:10:16,790
Mmm...

1216
01:10:20,290 --> 01:10:21,300
I have to go anyway.

1217
01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:23,300
I have that final tomorrow.

1218
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:28,800
I have one absentee
coming to me.

1219
01:10:38,310 --> 01:10:40,310
Yeah, she didn't mean it.

1220
01:10:40,310 --> 01:10:42,320
Not that way.

1221
01:10:42,320 --> 01:10:45,820
She's... a Quaker.

1222
01:10:47,820 --> 01:10:51,330
She's a Quaker.

1223
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:03,800
Hey.

1224
01:11:03,810 --> 01:11:05,320
Hey.

1225
01:11:07,290 --> 01:11:08,280
Thanks.

1226
01:11:11,780 --> 01:11:14,280
How come she didn't
spend the night?

1227
01:11:14,280 --> 01:11:16,280
She had tests.

1228
01:11:18,790 --> 01:11:20,790
She's Episcopalian.

1229
01:11:20,790 --> 01:11:22,790
:
Oh.

1230
01:11:25,790 --> 01:11:27,800
She's very pretty.

1231
01:11:27,800 --> 01:11:29,300
Yeah.

1232
01:11:29,300 --> 01:11:30,800
And smart.

1233
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:35,300
Think she's
too young for me?

1234
01:11:35,300 --> 01:11:37,300
Do you?

1235
01:11:40,810 --> 01:11:43,310
I got a lot of
unfinished business.

1236
01:11:46,810 --> 01:11:47,820
You got out, Carl.

1237
01:11:47,820 --> 01:11:49,320
Nobody would blame you

1238
01:11:49,320 --> 01:11:51,820
if you never went
back to Philadelphia.

1239
01:11:51,820 --> 01:11:57,660
There's a lot of decent folk
back home, you know

1240
01:11:57,660 --> 01:12:01,160
just trying
to make things better.

1241
01:12:01,160 --> 01:12:03,660
I just want to help them.

1242
01:12:03,660 --> 01:12:06,670
Just be careful.

1243
01:12:06,670 --> 01:12:10,170
Saving the world
is a tough business.

1244
01:12:12,660 --> 01:12:13,660
Compared to what?

1245
01:12:18,500 --> 01:12:20,110
That's good.

1246
01:12:21,750 --> 01:12:24,250
It is now.

1247
01:12:35,180 --> 01:12:36,680
Morning.

1248
01:12:36,680 --> 01:12:38,180
This is outrageous, Jim.

1249
01:12:38,180 --> 01:12:39,300
He hasn't done anything.

1250
01:12:39,300 --> 01:12:41,300
I want an explanation now!

1251
01:12:41,300 --> 01:12:43,420
They're coming up here
to ask Mr. Upchurch
some questions

1252
01:12:43,420 --> 01:12:44,920
about his involvement

1253
01:12:44,920 --> 01:12:46,920
in a terrorist
organization
called MOVE.

1254
01:12:47,430 --> 01:12:49,440
MOVE is a religious
organization.

1255
01:12:49,430 --> 01:12:50,430
Oh. I guess
that's why

1256
01:12:50,430 --> 01:12:51,930
the Philadelphia
Police Department

1257
01:12:51,930 --> 01:12:53,900
bombed them because
they're looking
for Jesus?

1258
01:12:53,900 --> 01:12:55,770
Your name was found
in a phone book

1259
01:12:55,770 --> 01:12:57,270
of a woman who died
in that bombing.

1260
01:12:57,270 --> 01:12:58,750
So that makes him
guilty of a crime?

1261
01:12:58,750 --> 01:13:01,240
I'm not saying that, but
I'll tell you one thing:

1262
01:13:01,240 --> 01:13:03,240
If he leaves his assigned
area without permission

1263
01:13:03,740 --> 01:13:05,730
from his parole officer,
he goes back to prison.

1264
01:13:05,730 --> 01:13:08,180
You been to South
Philly lately?

1265
01:13:08,180 --> 01:13:10,150
Wait, wait,
wait, wait!

1266
01:13:10,150 --> 01:13:13,150
You are going to put him back in
prison based on a technicality?

1267
01:13:13,150 --> 01:13:14,900
No! No, I will not let you!

1268
01:13:14,900 --> 01:13:16,270
This will not stand!

1269
01:13:16,270 --> 01:13:18,260
Mouth open, tongue out.

1270
01:13:18,260 --> 01:13:19,760
Side to side.

1271
01:13:21,110 --> 01:13:22,610
Lift your balls.

1272
01:13:22,610 --> 01:13:25,080
Side to side.

1273
01:13:25,080 --> 01:13:27,580
Turn around.

1274
01:13:27,580 --> 01:13:29,570
Bend over.

1275
01:13:29,570 --> 01:13:31,070
Spread your cheeks.

1276
01:13:57,030 --> 01:13:59,030
Hey, bitch.

1277
01:14:00,030 --> 01:14:01,030
What the fuck you doing?!

1278
01:14:01,030 --> 01:14:02,530
That ain't your place!

1279
01:14:02,530 --> 01:14:03,670
Talking all that shit...

1280
01:14:06,170 --> 01:14:07,290
...motherfucker!
Come on, man!

1281
01:14:11,740 --> 01:14:13,710
You don't want
to fuck with me.

1282
01:14:23,890 --> 01:14:25,890
Beat that motherfucker!

1283
01:14:25,890 --> 01:14:28,390
Hey! Come on, move!

1284
01:14:28,390 --> 01:14:29,890
It's overcrowded...

1285
01:14:29,890 --> 01:14:32,380
understaffed.

1286
01:14:32,380 --> 01:14:33,380
No recreation.

1287
01:14:33,860 --> 01:14:36,480
No job training.
No education.

1288
01:14:36,480 --> 01:14:39,990
Yeah, I know
it's prison...

1289
01:14:39,990 --> 01:14:42,990
but it ain't right to
treat men like animals

1290
01:14:43,490 --> 01:14:46,490
and then punish them
when they don't act human.

1291
01:14:46,490 --> 01:14:49,460
Yeah, listen to me.

1292
01:14:49,460 --> 01:14:53,100
Listen, you don't have
to keep coming here.

1293
01:14:53,100 --> 01:14:56,100
They got me for
another 12 months.

1294
01:14:56,100 --> 01:14:59,610
Okay, so I'll know
right where to find you.

1295
01:15:02,090 --> 01:15:05,210
Among another generation.

1296
01:15:05,210 --> 01:15:08,220
The sons of my brothers.

1297
01:15:09,720 --> 01:15:13,700
But they've got
one thing going for them:

1298
01:15:14,960 --> 01:15:16,460
You.

1299
01:15:18,330 --> 01:15:20,830
I tell you, baby.

1300
01:15:20,830 --> 01:15:23,830
You'd better leave before
I try to break out of here.

1301
01:15:29,300 --> 01:15:31,310
"The...

1302
01:15:31,810 --> 01:15:35,810
"cat is...

1303
01:15:35,810 --> 01:15:39,310
b-black and-and fat."

1304
01:15:39,310 --> 01:15:40,300
Yes.

1305
01:15:40,300 --> 01:15:42,300
Yes, brother, you're reading.

1306
01:15:42,300 --> 01:15:44,790
It's that simple.

1307
01:15:44,790 --> 01:15:46,290
Now, see,
Jean Valjean's thing is

1308
01:15:46,290 --> 01:15:49,290
"Look, I'm always going to be
the punk that did that crime

1309
01:15:49,290 --> 01:15:52,790
"but I claim
responsibility for it.

1310
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:56,800
"And I'm also a man

1311
01:15:56,800 --> 01:16:00,300
and I claim the right
to change my life."

1312
01:16:00,300 --> 01:16:02,800
You see what I'm saying?

1313
01:16:11,180 --> 01:16:12,680
Hey, bitch.

1314
01:16:16,680 --> 01:16:19,190
Now, I just know
you ain't fucking with my boys

1315
01:16:19,190 --> 01:16:21,690
talking some shit
about reading some book

1316
01:16:21,690 --> 01:16:23,190
that's going to change
their world.

1317
01:16:23,190 --> 01:16:26,560
You don't want
your boys to read?

1318
01:16:26,560 --> 01:16:29,060
Motherfucker fairy tale
about some better life?

1319
01:16:29,060 --> 01:16:30,560
That don't do shit
but make them soft.

1320
01:16:30,560 --> 01:16:32,570
Then what?
Then they dead.

1321
01:16:32,570 --> 01:16:35,570
You understand?

1322
01:16:35,570 --> 01:16:38,570
Nigger's crew is
all they got in
this world, homeboy.

1323
01:16:38,570 --> 01:16:41,540
My crew about as strong
as they need to be.

1324
01:16:41,540 --> 01:16:43,910
I'm just here to make sure
they stay that way,

1325
01:16:43,910 --> 01:16:45,410
So, you do me a favor--

1326
01:16:45,410 --> 01:16:47,660
just stay the fuck
out of the way...

1327
01:16:47,670 --> 01:16:49,180
nigger.

1328
01:16:49,170 --> 01:16:53,020
Yeah, I know where
you're coming from, brother.

1329
01:16:53,020 --> 01:16:55,510
You don't know shit, bitch.

1330
01:16:55,510 --> 01:17:00,010
Yeah, I know South Street,
South Philly.

1331
01:17:00,010 --> 01:17:03,730
Glen Mills, Milan,
Terra Haute

1332
01:17:03,730 --> 01:17:08,720
Atlanta, Western, Petersburg,
Lewisburg, Memphis.

1333
01:17:08,720 --> 01:17:10,190
So, you been locked up.

1334
01:17:10,190 --> 01:17:11,190
If you ain't noticed

1335
01:17:11,190 --> 01:17:13,190
ain't nary a nigger
in here free.

1336
01:17:13,190 --> 01:17:17,940
Look, brother, I understand
where you're coming from.

1337
01:17:17,950 --> 01:17:20,810
I wouldn't fuck with
you and your boys.

1338
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:25,300
All's I'm saying is a little
knowledge don't make a man soft.

1339
01:17:25,300 --> 01:17:26,800
It make a man smart.

1340
01:17:28,290 --> 01:17:29,790
Smart? Yeah?

1341
01:17:29,790 --> 01:17:32,290
So what you doing here, nigger?

1342
01:17:34,280 --> 01:17:36,780
Guess I'm supposed
to be here right now, brother.

1343
01:17:36,780 --> 01:17:37,780
Mm-hmm.

1344
01:17:37,780 --> 01:17:40,280
And I'm here for any man

1345
01:17:40,280 --> 01:17:45,270
from any crew
who wants to talk...

1346
01:17:45,270 --> 01:17:46,770
listen

1347
01:17:46,770 --> 01:17:49,260
or read.

1348
01:17:49,260 --> 01:17:53,260
See, now I'm gonna
have to fuck you up.

1349
01:17:53,760 --> 01:17:56,870
No, brother, all
you got to do is
serve your time.

1350
01:18:15,250 --> 01:18:16,250
I'll kill you, motherfucker!

1351
01:18:54,330 --> 01:18:55,690
Cut his throat!

1352
01:18:55,680 --> 01:18:58,180
No more!

1353
01:19:01,650 --> 01:19:03,120
No more.

1354
01:19:10,070 --> 01:19:11,540
Move! Move!

1355
01:19:16,850 --> 01:19:19,370
I was finally free.

1356
01:19:19,370 --> 01:19:20,870
No more parole.

1357
01:19:21,370 --> 01:19:24,870
I could go anywhere,
and I did--

1358
01:19:24,870 --> 01:19:28,880
to places
I never dreamed possible.

1359
01:19:44,390 --> 01:19:45,890
Come to bed?

1360
01:19:45,890 --> 01:19:48,900
In a minute.

1361
01:19:57,390 --> 01:20:00,510
Shut the fuck up!

1362
01:20:00,510 --> 01:20:03,260
Shut the fuck up!

1363
01:20:03,260 --> 01:20:05,260
Bitching about
how bad prison is.

1364
01:20:05,260 --> 01:20:06,760
It's prison,
goddamn it!

1365
01:20:06,760 --> 01:20:09,250
I'm up in this
motherfucker forever!

1366
01:20:09,250 --> 01:20:12,490
Ain't no job training
going to help me.

1367
01:20:12,490 --> 01:20:16,990
I got a brother out there,
banging, dropping out

1368
01:20:16,990 --> 01:20:19,490
'cause he wants to be like me.

1369
01:20:19,490 --> 01:20:23,000
Like me-- ain't that
some fucked-up shit?

1370
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,380
So you tell me,
Mr. Smart Nigger,

1371
01:20:25,380 --> 01:20:27,380
you tell me what the fuck
you're going to do

1372
01:20:27,380 --> 01:20:29,890
about the brothers and
the babies on the streets, huh?

1373
01:20:34,610 --> 01:20:36,110
Wake up, is that the sun?

1374
01:20:40,610 --> 01:20:42,620
Thanks.

1375
01:21:04,140 --> 01:21:07,270
When the Rodney King verdict
came in from Simi Valley,

1376
01:21:07,270 --> 01:21:09,280
Los Angeles police
went on full alert

1377
01:21:09,280 --> 01:21:13,380
but no one could have predicted
the magnitude of the unrest.

1378
01:21:13,380 --> 01:21:15,880
So far, there are
20 confirmed deaths

1379
01:21:15,880 --> 01:21:18,170
and fires are raging
out of control

1380
01:21:18,170 --> 01:21:20,970
all over South Central
Los Angeles tonight.

1381
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:37,040
I went to my church
to ask for help.

1382
01:21:37,040 --> 01:21:40,540
I had to get to L.A.,
no matter what.

1383
01:21:40,540 --> 01:21:43,160
And they raised enough money
to send me.

1384
01:21:43,160 --> 01:21:46,780
I walked the streets of L.A.
for 30 days.

1385
01:21:46,780 --> 01:21:50,780
I talked to teenage mothers,
cops,

1386
01:21:50,780 --> 01:21:52,640
old folks and gangsters.

1387
01:21:52,640 --> 01:21:56,140
Everybody was in a daze,
including me.

1388
01:21:56,140 --> 01:21:59,640
I didn't know
what I was looking for.

1389
01:22:00,140 --> 01:22:01,750
There were no ready answers.

1390
01:22:01,750 --> 01:22:03,750
When more than
a thousand people

1391
01:22:03,750 --> 01:22:06,250
are killed in one place
in one year

1392
01:22:06,250 --> 01:22:09,120
the U.N. defines it
as a war zone.

1393
01:22:09,120 --> 01:22:11,620
L.A. County was a war zone.

1394
01:22:50,060 --> 01:22:53,060
So...

1395
01:22:53,060 --> 01:22:55,570
What you planning, big man?

1396
01:22:55,570 --> 01:22:58,020
What?

1397
01:22:58,020 --> 01:23:00,020
I know you.

1398
01:23:00,020 --> 01:23:03,520
I know when something's up.

1399
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:05,660
Yeah.

1400
01:23:05,660 --> 01:23:07,660
It's pretty crazy.

1401
01:23:07,660 --> 01:23:08,660
Hmm?

1402
01:23:08,660 --> 01:23:12,670
It's real crazy.

1403
01:23:12,670 --> 01:23:15,670
I just need a name.

1404
01:23:15,670 --> 01:23:18,660
Good morning,
this is Carl Upchurch

1405
01:23:18,660 --> 01:23:22,660
of the Council for
Urban Peace and Justice.

1406
01:23:22,660 --> 01:23:24,660
Yes.

1407
01:23:24,660 --> 01:23:26,630
I think it's time for action.

1408
01:23:26,630 --> 01:23:28,630
If we can get them
to come together

1409
01:23:28,630 --> 01:23:30,130
from across the country...

1410
01:23:30,130 --> 01:23:32,040
The real danger is
if we don't try...

1411
01:23:32,040 --> 01:23:33,540
Stop the killing...

1412
01:23:33,540 --> 01:23:34,450
Save children's lives...

1413
01:23:34,450 --> 01:23:35,820
We need money, of course...

1414
01:23:35,820 --> 01:23:36,810
Do you know someone
I could go to?

1415
01:23:36,810 --> 01:23:38,190
Any help will do...

1416
01:23:38,190 --> 01:23:39,690
Thank you for your time.

1417
01:23:39,690 --> 01:23:42,180
What?

1418
01:23:42,180 --> 01:23:45,680
You will?

1419
01:23:49,670 --> 01:23:51,170
Hello?

1420
01:23:51,170 --> 01:23:52,670
Is Carl Upchurch available?

1421
01:23:52,670 --> 01:23:53,670
Yes, he is.

1422
01:23:53,670 --> 01:23:54,670
Does he work there?

1423
01:23:54,680 --> 01:23:55,690
Is this his office?

1424
01:23:55,680 --> 01:23:56,680
Yes, he does.

1425
01:23:56,680 --> 01:23:58,180
This is Reverend
Mac Charles Jones

1426
01:23:58,180 --> 01:24:00,180
from Saint Stephen's
in Kansas City.

1427
01:24:00,180 --> 01:24:01,180
Can you hold on just one moment?

1428
01:24:01,180 --> 01:24:02,680
And I'll see if he's available.

1429
01:24:02,680 --> 01:24:03,680
Sure.

1430
01:24:03,680 --> 01:24:04,680
Thanks.

1431
01:24:07,190 --> 01:24:10,660
Babe, it's a Reverend
Mac Charles Jones

1432
01:24:10,660 --> 01:24:12,660
from Kansas City.

1433
01:24:12,660 --> 01:24:14,160
Okay.

1434
01:24:18,170 --> 01:24:19,680
Want Bunny?

1435
01:24:19,670 --> 01:24:21,670
Bunny?

1436
01:24:21,670 --> 01:24:23,650
Reverend?

1437
01:24:23,650 --> 01:24:25,160
Are you for real?

1438
01:24:25,160 --> 01:24:26,160
Oh, yes, I am.

1439
01:24:26,160 --> 01:24:28,160
Kansas City work for you?

1440
01:24:28,160 --> 01:24:29,660
No, it's-it's perfect.

1441
01:24:29,660 --> 01:24:31,660
It's right in
the middle of the country.

1442
01:24:31,660 --> 01:24:34,160
We would love to have you here
on that date.

1443
01:24:34,160 --> 01:24:35,670
April 29.

1444
01:24:35,670 --> 01:24:37,670
Yeah, that's the...

1445
01:24:37,670 --> 01:24:39,170
Anniversary of the verdict.

1446
01:24:39,170 --> 01:24:40,170
Right.

1447
01:24:40,170 --> 01:24:41,670
It's a date, brother.

1448
01:24:41,670 --> 01:24:43,670
You're a brave man,
Carl Upchurch.

1449
01:24:43,670 --> 01:24:45,680
Thank you, thank you so much.

1450
01:24:45,680 --> 01:24:47,180
The world needs to know
about this.

1451
01:24:47,180 --> 01:24:48,680
Have you hired a publicist?

1452
01:24:48,680 --> 01:24:50,680
No, I haven't done that yet,
but...

1453
01:24:50,680 --> 01:24:54,680
Brother, could you tell me how
to set up a press conference?

1454
01:24:54,690 --> 01:24:56,200
A gang summit?

1455
01:24:57,090 --> 01:24:59,890
An urban peace and justice
summit in Kansas City.

1456
01:24:59,890 --> 01:25:03,090
Gang leaders from all over
America will be invited...

1457
01:25:03,090 --> 01:25:05,600
These are the people
influencing our communities,

1458
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:08,000
expressing themselves
with the language

1459
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:09,600
of the forgotten poor--
violence.

1460
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:12,300
We can keep ignoring
and jailing them

1461
01:25:12,300 --> 01:25:13,600
or we can listen,

1462
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:16,010
try to help shape
tomorrow's leaders.

1463
01:25:16,010 --> 01:25:17,210
Aren't you worried
what will happen

1464
01:25:17,210 --> 01:25:18,210
if you bring
these people together?

1465
01:25:18,210 --> 01:25:20,810
Aren't you worried
what will happen if we don't?

1466
01:25:20,810 --> 01:25:24,160
How can you possibly bring
rival gangs together peacefully?

1467
01:25:24,160 --> 01:25:26,130
I'll ask them.

1468
01:25:26,130 --> 01:25:27,850
You tripping, motherfucker.

1469
01:25:27,850 --> 01:25:28,820
You crazy, nigger?

1470
01:25:28,820 --> 01:25:29,940
Meet with them?

1471
01:25:29,940 --> 01:25:31,810
You're out of
your fucking mind.

1472
01:25:31,810 --> 01:25:33,160
Get the fuck
out of here.

1473
01:25:33,160 --> 01:25:34,660
You don't
represent no gang.

1474
01:25:34,660 --> 01:25:36,880
You with the police, right?

1475
01:25:36,880 --> 01:25:37,880
The FBI, CIA?

1476
01:25:37,880 --> 01:25:39,360
No, brother.

1477
01:25:39,360 --> 01:25:42,370
Who you pimping for?
Jesse? Farrakhan?

1478
01:25:42,370 --> 01:25:43,870
CNN?

1479
01:25:43,870 --> 01:25:46,870
The Council for
Urban Peace and Justice.

1480
01:25:46,870 --> 01:25:48,370
What the fuck is that?

1481
01:25:48,370 --> 01:25:50,370
It's me.

1482
01:25:51,880 --> 01:25:54,380
Nigger, please.

1483
01:25:56,130 --> 01:25:57,630
"Me"?

1484
01:25:57,630 --> 01:26:01,630
Brother, we got
an organization

1485
01:26:01,640 --> 01:26:03,150
that's been around
since Martin.

1486
01:26:03,140 --> 01:26:05,590
With influence
and respect.

1487
01:26:05,590 --> 01:26:08,070
That's why we
asked you to stop by.

1488
01:26:08,080 --> 01:26:11,590
We're a little concerned
with your lack of experience.

1489
01:26:11,580 --> 01:26:14,060
Something like this
is bigger than you.

1490
01:26:14,060 --> 01:26:15,060
We'll do it right.

1491
01:26:15,070 --> 01:26:18,060
Nightly news,
Sunday talk shows.

1492
01:26:18,050 --> 01:26:19,550
By the time we're through

1493
01:26:19,550 --> 01:26:22,060
the whole world will know
what we're talking about.

1494
01:26:22,560 --> 01:26:23,560
But when?

1495
01:26:23,560 --> 01:26:26,060
This can't wait.

1496
01:26:26,060 --> 01:26:28,060
The perfect time, brother--

1497
01:26:28,060 --> 01:26:30,060
right before
the next election.

1498
01:26:30,060 --> 01:26:32,070
Go home, Carl.

1499
01:26:32,070 --> 01:26:34,530
We'll do
this thing right.

1500
01:26:34,530 --> 01:26:37,040
I can't believe

1501
01:26:37,040 --> 01:26:39,020
it's these old-school,
civil rights

1502
01:26:39,020 --> 01:26:40,520
sanctified motherfuckers

1503
01:26:40,520 --> 01:26:42,030
trying to kill
this thing

1504
01:26:42,030 --> 01:26:43,530
because they
didn't think of it...

1505
01:26:44,030 --> 01:26:45,530
because it's not
their idea.

1506
01:26:45,530 --> 01:26:50,030
It's all about
ego and spin.

1507
01:26:50,030 --> 01:26:52,540
I'm starting to think

1508
01:26:52,540 --> 01:26:55,040
shit, maybe
they're right.

1509
01:26:55,040 --> 01:26:56,540
Maybe I'm
the crazy one.

1510
01:26:56,540 --> 01:26:58,540
Maybe this thing
is not going to fly.

1511
01:26:58,540 --> 01:27:00,530
What?

1512
01:27:00,530 --> 01:27:02,030
Nothing.

1513
01:27:02,030 --> 01:27:05,030
I know you got
something to say.

1514
01:27:05,030 --> 01:27:06,530
"Keep going, Carl.

1515
01:27:06,530 --> 01:27:08,530
All good causes, Carl."

1516
01:27:13,540 --> 01:27:16,040
I hate it when you do this.

1517
01:27:16,040 --> 01:27:18,040
No, you don't.

1518
01:27:29,560 --> 01:27:32,560
Yeah, I do.

1519
01:27:34,560 --> 01:27:36,680
Nah, I ain't here
to bullshit you, man.

1520
01:27:36,680 --> 01:27:38,680
Shit, I don't know
what you know.

1521
01:27:38,680 --> 01:27:41,180
Shit, I'm old school.

1522
01:27:41,180 --> 01:27:42,690
Man, I'm a dinosaur...

1523
01:27:42,690 --> 01:27:45,690
but I know one thing.

1524
01:27:45,690 --> 01:27:48,690
This shit must stop:

1525
01:27:48,690 --> 01:27:53,200
bullets flying,
your babies dying,
your mothers crying.

1526
01:27:53,200 --> 01:27:55,160
This is your home.

1527
01:27:55,170 --> 01:27:57,680
That's your babies out there
on the street.

1528
01:27:57,670 --> 01:28:00,170
The whole world
is watching.

1529
01:28:00,170 --> 01:28:02,040
All they see is the MTV version
of you.

1530
01:28:02,040 --> 01:28:04,520
"Yo, yo, yo, what's up,
my nigger?

1531
01:28:04,520 --> 01:28:05,530
"Yo, fuck the police.

1532
01:28:05,530 --> 01:28:08,110
Yo, come here, bitch.
Be my ho."

1533
01:28:08,110 --> 01:28:09,580
Let me tell you something,
brother.

1534
01:28:09,580 --> 01:28:11,580
I look into your eyes,
I see much more than that.

1535
01:28:11,580 --> 01:28:13,580
I see men.

1536
01:28:15,570 --> 01:28:17,420
I see survivors.

1537
01:28:17,420 --> 01:28:20,390
You're at war
trying to stake a claim

1538
01:28:20,890 --> 01:28:22,890
and the casualties around you

1539
01:28:22,890 --> 01:28:25,900
are getting bigger
than the upside.

1540
01:28:25,900 --> 01:28:29,400
Brothers, all I'm saying
is look into the eyes

1541
01:28:29,400 --> 01:28:32,400
of the man on the other end
of your gun.

1542
01:28:32,400 --> 01:28:35,970
Does he want what you want?

1543
01:28:35,970 --> 01:28:37,570
Does he look like you?

1544
01:28:37,570 --> 01:28:40,540
Just stop...

1545
01:28:40,540 --> 01:28:42,550
for one weekend.

1546
01:28:42,550 --> 01:28:44,050
One weekend.

1547
01:28:44,050 --> 01:28:46,550
Hold a conversation.

1548
01:28:46,550 --> 01:28:49,550
You show this world
who you really are.

1549
01:29:04,520 --> 01:29:07,520
Straight up?

1550
01:29:07,520 --> 01:29:10,020
You guarantee our safety?

1551
01:29:20,420 --> 01:29:21,770
Wake up, Kansas City.

1552
01:29:21,770 --> 01:29:25,270
Did you know there's a street
gang summit in your town today?

1553
01:29:25,270 --> 01:29:27,770
That's right, Christians.
Satan's in town

1554
01:29:27,770 --> 01:29:29,760
and he's brought his minions
with him.

1555
01:29:29,760 --> 01:29:31,260
This day was foretold in...

1556
01:29:40,750 --> 01:29:42,260
I'll be out in a second.

1557
01:29:47,090 --> 01:29:50,100
Saw your light.
You cool?

1558
01:29:50,100 --> 01:29:52,100
You been out here all night?

1559
01:29:52,100 --> 01:29:54,580
The Nation says,
"Stay with the man"

1560
01:29:54,580 --> 01:29:56,090
I stay with the man.

1561
01:29:59,090 --> 01:30:01,090
Let me ask you something.

1562
01:30:01,090 --> 01:30:04,340
You guard many
non-Muslims?

1563
01:30:04,340 --> 01:30:06,710
I go where the
Minister sends me.

1564
01:30:06,710 --> 01:30:10,180
Why does the Minister think
that I need a bodyguard?

1565
01:30:10,680 --> 01:30:12,190
Maybe you haven't heard.

1566
01:30:12,190 --> 01:30:13,190
Folks out here think

1567
01:30:13,690 --> 01:30:15,190
you're either crazy
or dangerous.

1568
01:30:15,190 --> 01:30:17,170
I've heard.

1569
01:30:21,680 --> 01:30:23,680
You think I'm crazy?

1570
01:30:23,680 --> 01:30:26,180
I'm here to protect you,
Brother Carl

1571
01:30:26,180 --> 01:30:27,680
not to think.

1572
01:30:34,170 --> 01:30:35,680
Give me about an hour.

1573
01:30:37,680 --> 01:30:39,680
I got your back.

1574
01:31:00,050 --> 01:31:01,400
Come in.

1575
01:31:06,010 --> 01:31:07,510
Any new arrivals?

1576
01:31:07,510 --> 01:31:09,510
No.

1577
01:31:09,510 --> 01:31:11,010
Shit.

1578
01:31:11,010 --> 01:31:12,510
You need to see this.

1579
01:31:12,510 --> 01:31:15,520
Kansas City Crips
pulled out last night.

1580
01:31:17,520 --> 01:31:18,520
Oh, this is great.

1581
01:31:19,020 --> 01:31:20,520
You tell everyone
we're failing

1582
01:31:20,520 --> 01:31:24,010
and scare the city half to death
while you're at it.

1583
01:31:27,360 --> 01:31:30,860
If we can't even get
the local gangs,
we're illegitimate.

1584
01:31:30,860 --> 01:31:31,860
We need them all here.

1585
01:31:31,870 --> 01:31:33,340
What more can you do?

1586
01:31:33,830 --> 01:31:35,330
I can get back
on that damn phone

1587
01:31:35,340 --> 01:31:36,350
that's what I can do.

1588
01:31:41,790 --> 01:31:43,290
Let's just go.

1589
01:31:52,900 --> 01:31:54,900
You know

1590
01:31:55,410 --> 01:31:57,020
the less brothers show,

1591
01:31:57,010 --> 01:31:59,510
the less likely
somebody gets hurt.

1592
01:32:13,470 --> 01:32:14,960
He just wants
to make sure

1593
01:32:14,960 --> 01:32:16,460
you're down
with the thing.

1594
01:32:16,460 --> 01:32:17,460
Yo, nigger

1595
01:32:17,460 --> 01:32:18,930
this shit ain't gonna fly.

1596
01:32:18,930 --> 01:32:20,930
It's cool.
What's the problem,
young brother?

1597
01:32:20,930 --> 01:32:22,800
I'll tell you what
my fucking problem is, nigger.

1598
01:32:23,300 --> 01:32:24,800
How the fuck you got me
come all this way

1599
01:32:24,800 --> 01:32:26,800
you put me in a room with two
motherfucking beds, nigger?

1600
01:32:26,800 --> 01:32:28,290
Who the fuck
you think we are?

1601
01:32:28,290 --> 01:32:29,290
As you can see

1602
01:32:29,290 --> 01:32:31,290
we're a little filled up
right now, brother.

1603
01:32:31,290 --> 01:32:32,290
There's a lot
of brothers here.

1604
01:32:32,790 --> 01:32:34,290
A cot is just going
to have to do.

1605
01:32:34,290 --> 01:32:36,780
Yo, my man,
don't be talking about no cot.

1606
01:32:36,780 --> 01:32:39,780
Yo, you gonna get us
another bed right now

1607
01:32:39,780 --> 01:32:41,280
or we gone.

1608
01:32:41,280 --> 01:32:44,290
You know something?

1609
01:32:44,290 --> 01:32:47,290
You're absolutely right,
brother.

1610
01:32:47,290 --> 01:32:49,240
You traveled a long way

1611
01:32:49,240 --> 01:32:51,740
and you deserve
to be well rested

1612
01:32:52,250 --> 01:32:53,750
comfortable.

1613
01:32:53,750 --> 01:32:55,730
You got a lot
of hard work to do.

1614
01:32:55,730 --> 01:32:57,720
I'll tell you what.

1615
01:32:57,720 --> 01:33:00,200
Take my key.

1616
01:33:00,200 --> 01:33:02,710
I'll have the front office
clean it up at once.

1617
01:33:02,710 --> 01:33:05,170
Where the hell
you gonna sleep?

1618
01:33:05,180 --> 01:33:07,190
Ain't about me, brother.

1619
01:33:11,680 --> 01:33:13,180
Yo, hold up.

1620
01:33:17,190 --> 01:33:18,690
I guess Li'l T
can sleep on a cot.

1621
01:33:18,690 --> 01:33:20,190
What the fuck?

1622
01:33:20,190 --> 01:33:22,190
Nigger, shut
the fuck up, man!

1623
01:33:24,690 --> 01:33:26,200
All right?

1624
01:33:26,200 --> 01:33:28,660
Cool.

1625
01:33:34,540 --> 01:33:36,540
The media has been barred
from the proceedings inside

1626
01:33:36,540 --> 01:33:38,040
though organizers promise
a press conference...

1627
01:33:38,040 --> 01:33:39,540
Here at St. Stephen's
Baptist Church

1628
01:33:39,540 --> 01:33:42,480
where the self-styled urban
gangsters have gathered

1629
01:33:42,480 --> 01:33:44,480
for this,
the first national meeting...

1630
01:33:44,480 --> 01:33:47,480
The media has been barred
from the proceedings inside

1631
01:33:47,480 --> 01:33:49,590
though organizers promise
a press conference

1632
01:33:49,590 --> 01:33:52,090
after the summit's conclusion
on Sunday.

1633
01:33:52,090 --> 01:33:54,090
That's good.

1634
01:34:01,600 --> 01:34:03,600
It's still early yet.

1635
01:34:14,330 --> 01:34:16,580
I miss you, too, baby,

1636
01:34:16,580 --> 01:34:18,580
more than you'll ever know.

1637
01:34:20,580 --> 01:34:23,090
Tell my little girl
I'll be home soon, okay?

1638
01:34:23,090 --> 01:34:25,090
Give her a kiss for me.

1639
01:34:25,090 --> 01:34:27,090
All right. Love you, too.

1640
01:34:31,580 --> 01:34:33,080
What's wrong?

1641
01:34:35,580 --> 01:34:37,580
Come see for yourself.

1642
01:35:06,280 --> 01:35:07,250
We showed, brother.

1643
01:35:07,250 --> 01:35:09,250
Thank you, brother.

1644
01:35:19,990 --> 01:35:23,110
The history I have
marks me as a blessed man.

1645
01:35:23,110 --> 01:35:26,980
South Street was once
the center of my universe.

1646
01:35:27,980 --> 01:35:28,970
I could have vanished

1647
01:35:28,970 --> 01:35:31,970
into the gravitational pull
of that black hole,

1648
01:35:31,970 --> 01:35:32,970
but with hard work

1649
01:35:32,970 --> 01:35:35,440
and by the grace of God,

1650
01:35:35,440 --> 01:35:37,930
I broke free.

1651
01:35:37,930 --> 01:35:39,430
With the help
of a few special people,

1652
01:35:39,430 --> 01:35:42,770
I learned that I may
not have been responsible

1653
01:35:42,770 --> 01:35:44,370
for what I was,

1654
01:35:44,370 --> 01:35:46,870
but I can be responsible
for what I am

1655
01:35:46,870 --> 01:35:48,970
and what I hope to become.

1656
01:35:56,300 --> 01:36:00,320
If I could do it,
so could countless others,

1657
01:36:00,320 --> 01:36:04,250
but somebody has
to tell them that.

1658
01:36:04,250 --> 01:36:08,220
Somebody has to lift their eyes
to a wider horizon.

1659
01:36:08,220 --> 01:36:11,690
Somebody has to inspire hope
within them.

1660
01:36:11,690 --> 01:36:13,700
I'm Carl Upchurch.

1661
01:36:15,700 --> 01:36:17,200
Peace.
