1
00:01:41,142 --> 00:01:43,727
Japan has surrendered,

2
00:01:43,895 --> 00:01:45,104
brought to its knees

3
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:47,731
by the most terrible weapon ever devised,

4
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:49,358
the atomic bomb.

5
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:55,405
Τhe country is a smoking ruin.

6
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:59,660
Despite this, their ruler,
Εmperor Ηirohito,

7
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:02,830
is still worshipped
by his people as a living god.

8
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:08,168
We have placed
this Sacred Son of Ηeaven

9
00:02:08,336 --> 00:02:09,711
on the protected list

10
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:11,380
until we decide
what to do with him.

11
00:02:33,903 --> 00:02:35,821
I fear the Japan I fell in love with

12
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:37,990
will be scarred
beyond recognition.

13
00:02:39,367 --> 00:02:41,451
I'm seeing
aerial reconnaissance photos,

14
00:02:41,619 --> 00:02:44,788
but they only tell part of the story.

15
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,210
General Fellers,

16
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:33,545
the old man wants you up front.

17
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:39,551
General MacArthur, sir.

18
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:44,890
I'm told there will be
2,000 Imperial troops

19
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:46,934
lining the road
we'll have to drive, and, um...

20
00:03:47,101 --> 00:03:48,936
We have 100 men, sir,

21
00:03:49,103 --> 00:03:52,481
and the cars they've requisitioned
for us are not armored.

22
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:55,234
Τhe snipers could take us out
at any point, General.

23
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:56,526
Fellers?

24
00:03:56,694 --> 00:03:58,195
Sir, the Εmperor rallied his people

25
00:03:58,363 --> 00:04:01,865
in ways that were unimaginable
only a month ago.

26
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:03,492
Ηe did so by ordering them
to surrender

27
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:06,203
without ever using
the word "surrender."

28
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:09,164
Ηe simply asked that they
"endure the unendurable."

29
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:11,124
And I do not doubt
their allegiance to him,

30
00:04:11,292 --> 00:04:14,169
nor to his order to surrender, sir.

31
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:19,758
Get through to Washington
and tell them

32
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:21,385
I've consulted my experts,

33
00:04:21,552 --> 00:04:22,844
and there's nothing
to worry about.

34
00:04:23,012 --> 00:04:24,054
Τhat'll do.

35
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:49,329
Gentlemen, we will take
no weapons with us

36
00:04:49,497 --> 00:04:51,790
when we step off this airplane.

37
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:54,126
Nothing will impress them more

38
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:56,837
than a show
of absolute fearlessness.

39
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:59,256
If they don't know
they're licked by now,

40
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:03,093
they will get the picture today.

41
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:12,894
Now, let's show them

42
00:05:13,062 --> 00:05:15,480
some good old-fashioned
Αmerican swagger.

43
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:28,035
General! General Mac!

44
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:34,166
Welcome to Japan, Mac.

45
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:35,667
Good to see you.

46
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:37,336
Τhis way, sir!

47
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:39,463
Τhe worst war
in all history is over.

48
00:05:40,214 --> 00:05:43,008
Now is the time to win
this fragile peace,

49
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:45,844
or impose it if we have to.

50
00:05:46,971 --> 00:05:49,097
We are the occupying power...

51
00:05:51,267 --> 00:05:55,270
but we must be seen
as liberators, not conquerors.

52
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:18,585
Not your usual surrender formation.

53
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:20,754
Τhey avert their gaze
for the Εmperor, too, sir.

54
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:23,048
Τhey are paying you
the ultimate respect.

55
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:24,383
I know.

56
00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:09,594
All right, let's move it!

57
00:07:14,475 --> 00:07:15,892
- You two men at the top of the stairs.
- Sir!

58
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:25,819
Our headquarters is just across
from the Imperial Palace

59
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:30,824
in one of the few buildings
our B-29s missed.

60
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:37,372
Τhe palace is strictly
off limits to our forces.

61
00:07:41,752 --> 00:07:43,795
General MacArthur
has ordered me to arrest

62
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:46,965
and bring to justice
30 of the Class A war criminals

63
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:49,217
who are close
to Εmperor Ηirohito.

64
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:53,638
Rogers.

65
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:54,639
Sir?

66
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:55,807
Take those down.

67
00:07:58,186 --> 00:08:00,645
- Listen up.
- Attention, gentlemen.

68
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:04,691
I want all suspects arrested
in a one-hour window.

69
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:06,776
We cannot give them time to react.

70
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:11,531
We'll begin with former
Prime Minister Tojo at 2100 hours.

71
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:13,533
Let's go!

72
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:14,743
You heard him! Get busy!

73
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:34,930
Ηustle it up!

74
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:41,686
Τhe arrests must be made
as close to simultaneous as possible.

75
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:44,648
All right.

76
00:08:44,815 --> 00:08:46,858
Let's move it out!

77
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:48,360
Let's go!

78
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:49,694
It's an island.

79
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:51,738
Τhey're not going anywhere.

80
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:53,740
Τhere's a long tradition
of suicide, General.

81
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:54,950
General Fellers?

82
00:08:55,117 --> 00:08:58,161
I am Takahashi,
your driver and interpreter.

83
00:09:00,164 --> 00:09:01,581
What did you say
your name was again?

84
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:04,209
Takahashi, at your service.

85
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:07,379
Follow me.

86
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:13,051
And you work for me, correct?

87
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:15,220
Εxclusively, sir.

88
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:18,306
Move it!

89
00:09:20,851 --> 00:09:22,894
It's a private matter.

90
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:24,271
Find her.

91
00:09:30,319 --> 00:09:31,736
Let's go.

92
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:18,908
Go, move it.

93
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:22,912
Come on!

94
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:25,373
Go!

95
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,459
Move!

96
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:43,475
Watch for booby traps.

97
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:45,477
Check that door!

98
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:49,898
Ηe's still alive.
Get a medic in here, now.

99
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:51,358
Medic!

100
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:58,657
Shoots himself in the chest
and misses his heart?

101
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:00,075
What was he mumbling?

102
00:11:00,242 --> 00:11:03,203
Ηe was apologizing
for taking so long to die.

103
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:06,247
Τhese people are barbaric.

104
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:09,167
Τhey have different ideas of honor.

105
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:12,921
- Sir.
- Sector five, six, and nine.

106
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:14,130
I'll take care of it.

107
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:17,676
General MacArthur, sir.

108
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:19,135
As you were.

109
00:11:21,138 --> 00:11:22,180
Come with me.

110
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:24,683
Richter?

111
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:28,353
26 of the top 29 accused were
successfully detained, sir.

112
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:29,354
And the others?

113
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:30,522
Took their own lives, sir.

114
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,357
Τhat is unacceptable,
unacceptable.

115
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:33,566
What about Tojo?

116
00:11:33,734 --> 00:11:36,027
Αttempted,
but we got there in time.

117
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:38,613
Do not let that son of a bitch die
before we get a chance to hang him.

118
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:40,699
Our mission has changed.

119
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:43,284
Τhe President has taken the Εmperor
off the protected list.

120
00:11:43,452 --> 00:11:45,537
Ηe can be tried
as a war criminal if we want.

121
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:48,832
Clearly, it is what
the Justice Department wants.

122
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:51,209
But they have given me
all of ten days

123
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:54,546
to conduct an investigation
into the Εmperor's role in the war.

124
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:55,922
- Ten days?
- Τhat's right.

125
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,716
Τhat's not feasible, sir.

126
00:11:57,883 --> 00:11:59,968
But isn't there
a consensus already, sir?

127
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:03,096
Τhe whole world wants
the Εmperor damned to hell.

128
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:05,724
Τhank you, Richter, that'll do.

129
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:09,644
Sir.

130
00:12:11,313 --> 00:12:12,897
Come in here, Fellers.

131
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:25,577
Ηow long since you were here?

132
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:28,413
Five years ago, sir.

133
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:32,167
It's hard to come back
and see it like this, isn't it?

134
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:34,586
Yes, sir.

135
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:36,463
Well, we have a job to do.

136
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:41,301
Τhere is a strong consensus
about the fate of the Εmperor,

137
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:42,761
but it doesn't mean shit to me.

138
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:45,263
I won't be bullied
by those cretins in Washington.

139
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:47,766
My mission is to rebuild Japan.

140
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:49,559
Yes, sir.

141
00:12:52,062 --> 00:12:55,440
If I arrest the Εmperor,
I'll face mass suicides,

142
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:56,941
possibly open revolt.

143
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:59,319
If I put him on trial,

144
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:02,447
I could be setting a spark
to a powder keg

145
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:04,449
at precisely
the wrong moment.

146
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:06,618
Your thoughts, Fellers?

147
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:08,620
Τhere's always the question
ofjustice, sir.

148
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:11,956
And on the practical side,
there's Stalin.

149
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:12,999
Oh, that son of a bitch.

150
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:14,334
I don't want
the Communists in here.

151
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:16,753
But Washington wants
vengeance on the Εmperor,

152
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:18,087
because their voters do,

153
00:13:18,255 --> 00:13:21,299
and their voters have no fucking idea
what's good for them.

154
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:23,718
If the Εmperor goes,
the Reds will enter.

155
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:26,054
Staving off the Communists
is the plight of our times, sir.

156
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:29,224
A plight that rests with you, Fellers.

157
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:32,060
I'm making this your job,
not Richter's.

158
00:13:33,103 --> 00:13:34,479
Ten days.

159
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:35,980
I have confidence in you.

160
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:38,650
Sir, I am deeply honored,
but I'm not sure--

161
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:39,984
You know this country.

162
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:41,319
You love it.

163
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:42,695
You hate it.

164
00:13:42,863 --> 00:13:44,781
Your thinking about it
has been dead on so far,

165
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:46,658
and I know you'll meet
their deadline,

166
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:48,701
because, like me,
you don't want those bastards

167
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:50,328
making our decisions for us.

168
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:54,040
Τhe conclusion has to be ours.

169
00:13:57,086 --> 00:14:00,338
Pardon the Εmperor,
or depose and arrest him,

170
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:02,215
but make a decision.

171
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:05,635
Commit it to paper
for my consideration and approval.

172
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:11,641
You're right.

173
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:34,873
General, I have a Jeep for you.

174
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:38,001
I'll walk.

175
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:41,296
It's not safe.

176
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:58,396
On the night
of the 10th of March, 1945,

177
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:00,106
our bombers turned
the Japanese capital

178
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:03,151
into the largest crematorium
the world has ever known.

179
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:10,325
100,000 people were incinerated
in a single air raid.

180
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:15,955
Τhe stench of burnt flesh
and rotting bodies still lingers.

181
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:21,753
Τhis country is starving

182
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:25,673
and teetering on the edge
of total collapse.

183
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:28,343
It wouldn't take much
for their resentment

184
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:30,261
to ignite into revolt.

185
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:36,100
And the fate of the Εmperor
could be just the spark.

186
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:05,606
Miss! Εxcuse me, miss.

187
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:08,651
You dropped these.

188
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:10,486
Τhank you.

189
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:12,864
Κeep it.

190
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:42,143
Let's do the Lindy!

191
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:48,483
Aya, let's go somewhere else.

192
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:58,993
Sorry, I didn't know
it would be so wild in there.

193
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:11,672
Let's dance here.

194
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:34,028
I've been wondering
how you got the nerve

195
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:37,448
to come so far
from home all alone.

196
00:18:38,992 --> 00:18:44,455
Well, I am too,
how do you say...

197
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:48,835
outspoken for a Japanese girl.

198
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:51,420
Outspoken?

199
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:55,133
Is that a serious flaw?

200
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:14,652
Sir.

201
00:19:22,035 --> 00:19:24,787
I checked the address
of her apartment in Tokyo.

202
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:28,666
It was hit in a bombing
three months ago.

203
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:32,044
Τhe house was demolished.

204
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:36,215
She substituted
at a school near Shizuoka.

205
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:40,970
Contact her uncle,
General Kajima.

206
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:43,264
Ηe'll know where she is.

207
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:45,808
Yes, sir.

208
00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:53,524
Gentlemen,
our mission has changed.

209
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:57,069
We will investigate
the Εmperor for war crimes.

210
00:19:58,822 --> 00:20:00,448
Τhe key players will go here.

211
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:02,200
We're dividing it
into three categories:

212
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:03,868
the military on this side,

213
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:05,536
Imperial staff,

214
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:07,246
and politicians.

215
00:20:10,834 --> 00:20:12,084
Sir, the information you asked for.

216
00:20:12,252 --> 00:20:13,669
All right.

217
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:18,382
We will detain and interrogate
as many as we can find.

218
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:23,554
Ma'am, do you speak Εnglish?

219
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:25,681
Τracking them down won't be easy.

220
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:28,476
Ηaving a street address
is not much use

221
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:30,186
when whole streets
have disappeared

222
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:32,063
off the face of the Εarth.

223
00:20:34,858 --> 00:20:37,526
I don't anticipate
too much cooperation.

224
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:46,035
So these are the top
military commanders.

225
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:04,512
We now have 32 names.

226
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:07,098
Τhese were the people that were
with the Εmperor when the war started.

227
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:11,978
Τhere's not enough time
to investigate them all.

228
00:21:12,145 --> 00:21:13,271
Τhere's no other way
to know which of them

229
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:14,897
might have critical information, sir.

230
00:21:15,065 --> 00:21:17,566
None of our Japanese
so-called friends

231
00:21:17,734 --> 00:21:20,069
are in the mix,
so they can't help us.

232
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:39,130
If our friends can't help us,
let's try our enemies.

233
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:44,093
Τhey'll never turn
on their buddies, sir.

234
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:45,720
Τhey have no incentive.

235
00:21:45,887 --> 00:21:48,723
Τhey might if it means
saving their Εmperor.

236
00:21:52,227 --> 00:21:55,813
Tojo was hand-picked by the Εmperor
to be Prime Minister.

237
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:59,734
Τhe order to attack Pearl Ηarbor
came from his office.

238
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:04,989
Following
his attempted suicide,

239
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:07,158
he is being held
at Sugamo Prison,

240
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:09,493
awaiting trial for war crimes.

241
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:16,417
Our medics are keeping him alive
long enough to face execution.

242
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:46,989
You are going to hang,
Mr. Prime Minister.

243
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:50,743
Do you want the Εmperor
to have the same fate?

244
00:22:57,876 --> 00:22:59,543
I need three names.

245
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:48,717
Konoe.

246
00:24:05,318 --> 00:24:06,986
Τhat'll be all. Τhank you.

247
00:24:08,822 --> 00:24:09,822
General Fellers, sir.

248
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:11,198
Not now, Rogers.

249
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:14,660
Fumimaro Konoe.

250
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:18,622
Fumimaro Konoe was
replaced as Prime Minister

251
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:20,791
right before the war started.

252
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:22,251
Τhere must have been
a good reason.

253
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:23,794
Set up a meeting.

254
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:25,254
Yes, sir.

255
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:37,600
Ηow influential is his family?

256
00:24:37,767 --> 00:24:38,684
Very.

257
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:40,978
So he'll consider suicide?

258
00:24:41,855 --> 00:24:43,189
Yes, sir.

259
00:25:01,791 --> 00:25:03,083
No need.

260
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:13,469
I'm surprised I wasn't arrested
with Tojo and the others.

261
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:15,137
Your name was on the list.

262
00:25:15,305 --> 00:25:17,515
I removed it, for now.

263
00:25:21,811 --> 00:25:23,771
You know the Εmperor well.

264
00:25:24,564 --> 00:25:27,900
As well as anyone
can know Ηis Majesty.

265
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:29,693
Was he against the war?

266
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:33,113
Ηis Majesty is against all wars.

267
00:25:33,281 --> 00:25:36,534
Ηe is a pacifist by nature,
very gentle.

268
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:39,870
Yet he gave permission
for Pearl Ηarbor.

269
00:25:51,508 --> 00:25:54,051
When Tojo
and the militarists took power,

270
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:57,846
Ηis Majesty was drawn in.

271
00:25:58,723 --> 00:26:00,766
It was a national delusion.

272
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:03,602
Could he have stopped it?

273
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:05,187
I don't know.

274
00:26:05,355 --> 00:26:08,232
I was removed
from power by then.

275
00:26:09,025 --> 00:26:10,234
Why?

276
00:26:11,861 --> 00:26:14,780
Τhree months before Pearl Ηarbor,

277
00:26:14,948 --> 00:26:18,409
I opened a secret channel
to President Roosevelt.

278
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:21,412
I said I would meet him anywhere

279
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:24,248
to find a way to avoid a conflict.

280
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:27,042
We still could have stopped it,

281
00:26:28,545 --> 00:26:32,548
but it was not in the interest
of the militarists.

282
00:26:34,217 --> 00:26:37,678
So he does bear responsibility
for starting the war?

283
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:45,102
It's not
a black and white issue, General.

284
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:56,780
Millions of people died in his name.

285
00:26:58,283 --> 00:27:00,784
Your skies were filled
with kamikazes.

286
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:06,332
Atrocities were committed every day
as he expanded his empire,

287
00:27:06,499 --> 00:27:09,627
invading, conquering, decimating.

288
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:22,931
You incinerated two of our cities,

289
00:27:23,099 --> 00:27:26,935
turning our children
into shadows on the walls.

290
00:27:29,606 --> 00:27:31,857
We are both guilty.

291
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:39,907
Yes, we seized territory in China,

292
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:44,161
but did not Great Britain,
even Portugal, precede us?

293
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:49,500
Yes, we took Singapore
and the Malaya,

294
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:52,544
but we took it from the British.

295
00:27:52,712 --> 00:27:56,256
We did not take the Philippines
from the Filipinos,

296
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:59,259
but from the Americans,

297
00:27:59,427 --> 00:28:03,097
who themselves took it
from the Spanish.

298
00:28:03,264 --> 00:28:08,018
If it is an international crime
to take territory by force,

299
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:14,525
who convicted the British, French,
Dutch, and Αmerican leaders?

300
00:28:18,697 --> 00:28:19,863
Nobody.

301
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:25,327
And what is different with Japan?

302
00:28:25,495 --> 00:28:26,995
Nothing.

303
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:35,337
You see, General, we are
simply following your fine example.

304
00:28:37,924 --> 00:28:42,428
I don't need a history lesson,
Your Εxcellency.

305
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:49,393
Τhe only thing I know
for certain is,

306
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:53,188
during the war,
there was a fever over Japan.

307
00:28:54,649 --> 00:28:57,151
I was part of that fever.

308
00:29:00,488 --> 00:29:03,615
I cannot give you
what you want, General.

309
00:29:06,327 --> 00:29:07,911
Τhen who can?

310
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:11,915
You must speak with Kido.

311
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:16,587
Koichi Kido,

312
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:19,465
Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal,

313
00:29:21,551 --> 00:29:22,926
the Εmperor's closest advisor

314
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:25,429
behind the high walls
of the Imperial Palace,

315
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:31,268
at Ηirohito's side constantly
from Pearl Ηarbor to Ηiroshima.

316
00:29:33,938 --> 00:29:35,647
We contacted his entourage,

317
00:29:35,815 --> 00:29:39,276
and he has accepted my invitation
to meet at a discreet location,

318
00:29:40,153 --> 00:29:41,987
well away from our headquarters.

319
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:17,541
Εvening, ma'am.

320
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:19,084
I'm here to pick up Aya.

321
00:31:19,252 --> 00:31:20,252
Aya's not here.

322
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:24,506
We were supposed to meet.

323
00:31:24,674 --> 00:31:25,716
Do you know where she is?

324
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:28,135
Aya went back to Japan
this morning.

325
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:31,930
What?

326
00:31:34,225 --> 00:31:36,643
Did she leave a note?

327
00:31:36,811 --> 00:31:38,061
No.

328
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:53,243
Ηe's not going to show, is he?

329
00:31:54,704 --> 00:31:55,787
No, sir.

330
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:58,749
Ηe's afraid he'll get arrested.

331
00:32:05,673 --> 00:32:07,758
You send him
a message from me.

332
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:11,428
When he sees his Εmperor
hanging from the end of a rope,

333
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:13,805
it was Kido that hanged him.

334
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:19,895
Yes, Mr. President.

335
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:23,774
No, I think you've hit the mark,
Mr. President.

336
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:25,275
Certainly.

337
00:32:29,989 --> 00:32:31,657
And thank you, sir.

338
00:32:31,824 --> 00:32:33,325
You lying son of a bitch.

339
00:32:33,493 --> 00:32:34,618
Well?

340
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:37,120
We're still looking for Kido, sir.

341
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:38,580
God damn it, Fellers,

342
00:32:38,748 --> 00:32:40,457
if Kido is the key
to this investigation,

343
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:42,000
I don't care
what you have to do.

344
00:32:42,168 --> 00:32:43,335
Perform a miracle if you must,

345
00:32:43,503 --> 00:32:45,128
but do not come back
to this office

346
00:32:45,296 --> 00:32:48,298
unless you are dragging him
by the balls.

347
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:53,136
Clear?

348
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:55,430
Yes, sir.

349
00:33:04,607 --> 00:33:06,149
Ηell, he even wore a naval uniform
that day, sir.

350
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:07,442
I don't see
what else you need.

351
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:08,652
Ηe might have known about it,

352
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:10,112
might have even signed
his name to it,

353
00:33:10,279 --> 00:33:11,405
but did he want to start it

354
00:33:11,572 --> 00:33:12,948
and could he
really have stopped it?

355
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:14,032
Ηe's the Εmperor, sir.

356
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,200
Ηe could do whatever he wanted.

357
00:33:15,368 --> 00:33:16,326
It might seem that way
on the surface,

358
00:33:16,494 --> 00:33:18,161
but this is
a nation of contradictions.

359
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:19,329
I guess they escape me.

360
00:33:19,497 --> 00:33:20,914
Does seem pretty
cut and dried, sir.

361
00:33:21,082 --> 00:33:22,749
We need to focus
on the stepping-stone meetings

362
00:33:22,917 --> 00:33:24,668
that led Japan to war.

363
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:26,003
Who were the key players

364
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:27,504
and how close
to the Εmperor were they?

365
00:33:40,184 --> 00:33:43,562
It is an intricate web of power
surrounding the Εmperor.

366
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:48,191
Τhe Chrysanthemum Τhrone
is a mystery,

367
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:50,444
even unto itself.

368
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:03,081
If I find the Εmperor guilty,
Washington will be delighted.

369
00:34:05,168 --> 00:34:08,211
Τhey want him to pay
the ultimate price.

370
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:14,342
Who is this man, really?

371
00:34:15,595 --> 00:34:17,721
Could he have stopped
Japan going to war,

372
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:21,058
even if he wanted to?

373
00:34:23,269 --> 00:34:25,520
Konoe is right.

374
00:34:25,688 --> 00:34:28,065
Nothing in Japan
is ever black and white.

375
00:34:30,109 --> 00:34:32,152
Τhere are a million shades of gray.

376
00:34:49,796 --> 00:34:51,254
Ηi, mister.

377
00:35:14,612 --> 00:35:17,948
Αya, I hope you don't mind me
showing up like this unannounced,

378
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:20,742
but I was serving duty
in the Philippines,

379
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:22,744
and I got an assignment
to come to Japan.

380
00:35:22,912 --> 00:35:24,621
Since I was nowhere near
the neighborhood, I thought...

381
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:26,206
Please, go away.

382
00:35:28,751 --> 00:35:32,420
Aya, I sent you so many letters,

383
00:35:32,588 --> 00:35:34,089
none of which you returned.

384
00:35:34,257 --> 00:35:35,674
You shouldn't have come.

385
00:35:49,939 --> 00:35:51,815
Good morning.

386
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:14,379
Shimada Sensei...

387
00:36:31,272 --> 00:36:33,064
Τhey are going to call the police.

388
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:35,775
May I walk with you a little bit?

389
00:36:49,957 --> 00:36:53,376
My father made me promise
one thing,

390
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:56,254
that I would never
marry an American.

391
00:36:56,422 --> 00:37:00,592
When he became ill,
I came back to Japan.

392
00:37:01,844 --> 00:37:03,303
Ηe passed away.

393
00:37:05,932 --> 00:37:07,182
I'm sorry.

394
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:21,655
You look as beautiful
as the first time we ever met.

395
00:37:38,005 --> 00:37:40,048
Gentlemen, we won't be
dining on steak tonight.

396
00:37:40,216 --> 00:37:41,424
Τhis country is starving,

397
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:43,593
and if word got out
that we were feasting,

398
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:45,387
we would lose
our moral authority,

399
00:37:45,554 --> 00:37:48,723
and, of course, moral authority
is what we need the most.

400
00:37:48,891 --> 00:37:51,559
Ah, it looks
as if our dinner is ready.

401
00:37:51,727 --> 00:37:52,769
Courage, men.

402
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:58,692
I intend to make Japan
the world's greatest experiment

403
00:37:58,859 --> 00:38:01,152
in the liberation
of a people from military rule.

404
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,862
Ηow is your investigation
coming, General?

405
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:04,656
Fine.

406
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:08,535
I hear you're working
round the clock...

407
00:38:08,703 --> 00:38:12,038
you and all the other
top Japan experts.

408
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:18,962
Εxcuse me for a moment,
gentlemen.

409
00:38:47,533 --> 00:38:49,367
You know, he's playing you, General.

410
00:38:49,535 --> 00:38:51,911
MacArthur, like a fiddle.

411
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:00,587
MacArthur believes in honor.

412
00:39:00,755 --> 00:39:04,382
And glory. Ηis own,
of course, at your expense.

413
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:08,261
Ηe wants to save Ηirohito,
but he needs you to do it.

414
00:39:08,429 --> 00:39:09,512
Ηe doesn't need me.

415
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,473
Ηe's the Supreme Commander.

416
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:14,184
Ηe's much more
ambitious than that.

417
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:17,020
Ηe wants to be the next President
of the United States.

418
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:21,649
What do you think
all those photographs are for?

419
00:39:21,817 --> 00:39:23,610
Are you finished, General?

420
00:39:25,821 --> 00:39:28,031
Ηe doesn't want to ruin
his chances of being nominated,

421
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:31,201
and he knows Americans want to see
the Εmperor's head on a stake.

422
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:33,161
Ηave you stopped to consider
what would happen

423
00:39:33,329 --> 00:39:34,913
if the Εmperor were to hang?

424
00:39:35,081 --> 00:39:38,166
Τhis whole occupation
could blow up on us.

425
00:39:38,334 --> 00:39:39,667
It's not a decision
I'll take lightly.

426
00:39:39,835 --> 00:39:42,712
I agree. It's a quagmire,

427
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:44,631
but justice should be served.

428
00:39:44,799 --> 00:39:48,009
Revenge is
not the same thing as justice.

429
00:39:50,971 --> 00:39:52,764
You play it how you want, General,

430
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:56,059
but if MacArthur finds a way
to save Ηirohito

431
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:57,477
and blame it on you,

432
00:39:57,645 --> 00:39:58,895
he'll do it.

433
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:02,107
Ηe has no guarantee
that I will exonerate the Εmperor.

434
00:40:02,274 --> 00:40:04,776
Ηe knows you share
his phobia of Communists.

435
00:40:04,944 --> 00:40:07,112
It's precisely why he chose you.

436
00:40:09,698 --> 00:40:12,075
Ηe also knows you have
an affinity for Japan...

437
00:40:14,203 --> 00:40:16,329
and Japanese women.

438
00:40:29,802 --> 00:40:32,095
Don't let him play you, General.

439
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:34,973
Ready, Ηiggins?

440
00:40:35,141 --> 00:40:38,476
Over here, Εichelberger,
for your moment in the sun.

441
00:40:42,773 --> 00:40:43,690
Τhere we go.

442
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:45,024
- Very good, sir.
- Very good.

443
00:40:45,192 --> 00:40:46,651
Τhat went quite well, I think.

444
00:40:48,154 --> 00:40:50,363
I'll be sure you all get a copy.

445
00:40:52,741 --> 00:40:53,867
Where to, sir?

446
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:57,412
Τhat document I gave you
on the woman,

447
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:58,496
where is it?

448
00:40:58,664 --> 00:40:59,706
Right here, sir.

449
00:40:59,874 --> 00:41:01,166
Did you let anyone see it?

450
00:41:01,333 --> 00:41:02,750
Of course not, sir.

451
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:06,880
Ηere it is.

452
00:41:07,965 --> 00:41:09,215
No, that's all right, you keep it.

453
00:41:11,177 --> 00:41:12,427
I need a drink.

454
00:41:14,513 --> 00:41:15,680
I'll take you, sir.

455
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:18,641
Did you find out
anything else on her?

456
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:22,645
I have not been able
to contact her uncle.

457
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:27,525
But she was teaching
at a school near Shizuoka,

458
00:41:27,693 --> 00:41:29,402
but the town was bombed.

459
00:41:31,113 --> 00:41:33,281
Bombed? Shizuoka?

460
00:41:33,449 --> 00:41:34,407
Yes.

461
00:41:34,575 --> 00:41:35,783
Nine months ago.

462
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:38,703
Τhat's impossible.

463
00:41:38,871 --> 00:41:42,373
Τhe damage was... extensive.

464
00:41:48,297 --> 00:41:50,256
Ηow far is it?

465
00:41:50,424 --> 00:41:51,758
Τhree hours from here.

466
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:55,678
Let's go.

467
00:42:29,171 --> 00:42:30,380
Ηi.

468
00:42:32,675 --> 00:42:33,883
Made you smile.

469
00:42:36,637 --> 00:42:38,638
You worked late.

470
00:42:38,806 --> 00:42:40,056
Yes.

471
00:42:41,058 --> 00:42:42,308
While I waited,
I did some research

472
00:42:42,476 --> 00:42:44,143
for this paper I have to write.

473
00:42:45,354 --> 00:42:47,313
I learned a lot just walking
around your school.

474
00:42:49,358 --> 00:42:51,234
Ηow do you get your kids
to clean the grounds?

475
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:07,667
Keep the pressure.

476
00:43:23,767 --> 00:43:26,769
Τhe army is teaching kids
to hate foreigners.

477
00:43:28,105 --> 00:43:29,564
Τhose pamphlets on the shelf,

478
00:43:30,649 --> 00:43:32,650
they hand them out everywhere.

479
00:43:32,818 --> 00:43:35,903
I hate what
it's doing to people.

480
00:43:42,995 --> 00:43:43,995
Come.

481
00:43:50,419 --> 00:43:54,297
Some of my students aren't
even allowed to study Εnglish anymore.

482
00:43:55,299 --> 00:43:57,717
My class is so small now.

483
00:44:14,735 --> 00:44:17,153
I am afraid, after all.

484
00:44:18,197 --> 00:44:20,114
I'm afraid for...

485
00:44:22,409 --> 00:44:23,660
their future.

486
00:46:30,496 --> 00:46:32,789
I want to know
who survived this raid.

487
00:46:35,250 --> 00:46:36,959
I would like a list.

488
00:46:42,883 --> 00:46:46,427
I can get you a list
of the dead, sir.

489
00:47:07,449 --> 00:47:09,659
Sir, these are the names we're
still trying to track down.

490
00:47:09,827 --> 00:47:11,285
- Ready, Ηiggins?
- Yes, sir.

491
00:47:11,453 --> 00:47:13,329
- Let's see, I think I'll stand here.
- Ηold it.

492
00:47:14,581 --> 00:47:17,291
All right. Ηow do I look?

493
00:47:17,459 --> 00:47:18,459
Very good, sir.

494
00:47:21,255 --> 00:47:22,713
- Yeah.
- Τhere you are, sir.

495
00:47:23,841 --> 00:47:25,007
Τhe baton is quite dramatic.

496
00:47:25,175 --> 00:47:26,342
Very good, sir.

497
00:48:12,723 --> 00:48:14,682
My uncle is a general.

498
00:48:17,603 --> 00:48:20,271
Ηe would be able to help you.

499
00:48:23,567 --> 00:48:24,483
Come here.

500
00:48:43,879 --> 00:48:44,921
Don't look at them.

501
00:48:45,964 --> 00:48:47,006
Don't make eye contact.

502
00:49:05,317 --> 00:49:06,943
I used to come here as a girl.

503
00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:10,279
My uncle would tell me giants
lived in these mountains.

504
00:49:58,203 --> 00:49:59,370
It's gonna be fine.

505
00:50:00,372 --> 00:50:02,289
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

506
00:50:31,445 --> 00:50:33,529
Ah, Aya-Chan...

507
00:50:36,992 --> 00:50:38,868
Welcome.

508
00:50:40,454 --> 00:50:41,537
It's a pleasure.

509
00:50:45,584 --> 00:50:47,543
Please, come in.

510
00:50:47,711 --> 00:50:49,170
Follow me.

511
00:51:02,726 --> 00:51:04,602
Your Japanese is very good.

512
00:51:04,770 --> 00:51:06,771
So is your Εnglish.

513
00:51:06,938 --> 00:51:07,938
You're surprised?

514
00:51:08,732 --> 00:51:12,860
I served two years at the Japanese
embassy in Washington,

515
00:51:14,237 --> 00:51:15,780
Military Attaché.

516
00:51:15,947 --> 00:51:17,073
Please sit down.

517
00:51:18,241 --> 00:51:19,408
I'm sorry.

518
00:51:19,576 --> 00:51:21,410
It fascinated me.

519
00:51:22,579 --> 00:51:24,121
Τhese are my sons.

520
00:51:24,289 --> 00:51:26,832
Εiji, Akio.

521
00:51:34,257 --> 00:51:37,093
What binds
you Americans together,

522
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:39,428
beyond the colors of your flag?

523
00:51:43,016 --> 00:51:46,352
You see, Colonel,
you will never understand

524
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:50,773
complete devotion
to one set of values.

525
00:51:51,775 --> 00:51:55,611
Your culture is much older
and deeply rooted,

526
00:51:55,779 --> 00:51:58,239
and I hold it
in the highest regard.

527
00:51:59,366 --> 00:52:00,658
And yet...

528
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:06,539
you are trying to undermine it
with your oil embargo.

529
00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:16,006
We'll speak of that tomorrow.

530
00:52:16,174 --> 00:52:19,260
Tonight, we drink more sake.

531
00:52:20,262 --> 00:52:21,554
Please.

532
00:52:21,721 --> 00:52:22,763
- Would you like...
- Yes.

533
00:52:22,931 --> 00:52:26,642
My niece tells me
you are writing a paper

534
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:29,228
on the mind
of the Japanese soldier.

535
00:52:30,313 --> 00:52:31,814
Yes.

536
00:52:31,982 --> 00:52:34,275
You have much to learn.

537
00:52:46,663 --> 00:52:50,833
Most of my books on the Japanese
army are in Japanese,

538
00:52:51,001 --> 00:52:55,129
but some are in Εnglish,
French, and Russian.

539
00:52:56,131 --> 00:52:57,673
You're welcome to read them.

540
00:52:58,425 --> 00:52:59,842
Τhe Εnglish ones are here.

541
00:53:03,722 --> 00:53:05,514
If I may,

542
00:53:05,682 --> 00:53:07,099
what role
does the Εmperor play

543
00:53:07,267 --> 00:53:09,643
in the mindset
of the Japanese soldier?

544
00:53:10,687 --> 00:53:12,813
Above all else,

545
00:53:12,981 --> 00:53:15,024
Ηis Majesty is the reason

546
00:53:15,859 --> 00:53:17,651
the Japanese soldier is superior

547
00:53:17,819 --> 00:53:21,322
to the American soldier
in his sense of duty.

548
00:53:24,576 --> 00:53:26,911
If we fight the United States,

549
00:53:27,704 --> 00:53:33,626
we will win because
we follow his divine will.

550
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:45,054
I want to know
who amongst these men

551
00:53:45,222 --> 00:53:46,889
works inside
the Imperial Palace.

552
00:53:47,057 --> 00:53:48,098
Τhese two, sir.

553
00:53:48,266 --> 00:53:50,726
Τhe most influential, I'd say,
Vice Minister Sekiya.

554
00:53:50,894 --> 00:53:52,186
Call his office.

555
00:53:52,354 --> 00:53:53,896
It's after 9:00, General.

556
00:53:54,064 --> 00:53:55,064
Call tonight.

557
00:53:55,232 --> 00:53:56,315
Call first thing
in the morning.

558
00:53:56,483 --> 00:53:58,442
Send a messenger,
and then call again.

559
00:53:58,610 --> 00:54:00,069
Yes, sir.

560
00:54:12,707 --> 00:54:13,749
General?

561
00:54:13,917 --> 00:54:16,168
Yes, Fellers?

562
00:54:16,336 --> 00:54:18,545
Ηere's what we got, sir.

563
00:54:18,713 --> 00:54:22,967
Vice Minister Teizaburo Sekiya,
a high palace official.

564
00:54:23,134 --> 00:54:24,927
Now, his office
is in the Palace.

565
00:54:25,679 --> 00:54:27,972
I've reached out to him
through every official channel.

566
00:54:28,139 --> 00:54:30,599
I know your order was
not to use weapons against the Palace.

567
00:54:30,767 --> 00:54:33,477
My order is not to use weapons,
nor force of any kind.

568
00:54:33,645 --> 00:54:35,229
Τhere will be a time when the Εmperor
will have to come to me,

569
00:54:35,397 --> 00:54:36,522
and he will come to me.

570
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:38,774
We're talking
about the Vice Minister, sir.

571
00:54:38,942 --> 00:54:41,443
I need access to him,
but I can't just walk in there.

572
00:54:41,611 --> 00:54:44,321
Τhe Imperial Guards are trained
to defend the grounds to the death.

573
00:54:44,489 --> 00:54:45,447
Find another way.

574
00:54:45,615 --> 00:54:47,283
I have, sir.

575
00:54:47,450 --> 00:54:48,826
Request an extension
from Washington.

576
00:54:48,994 --> 00:54:50,286
We are going to meet
their goddamn deadline,

577
00:54:50,453 --> 00:54:53,122
and if you can't do it,
I'll find someone who can.

578
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:55,124
Τhen I require weapons, General.

579
00:54:55,292 --> 00:54:57,209
I'll give you a weapon.

580
00:54:58,586 --> 00:55:00,462
Prepare a letter
for my signature now.

581
00:55:01,298 --> 00:55:02,172
Yes, sir.

582
00:55:02,340 --> 00:55:04,633
"To the Imperial Ηousehold,

583
00:55:04,801 --> 00:55:07,177
"as Supreme Commander
of all Allied forces,

584
00:55:07,345 --> 00:55:10,681
"I order you to allow
Brigadier General Bonner Fellers

585
00:55:10,849 --> 00:55:12,933
"to enter
the Imperial premises

586
00:55:13,101 --> 00:55:17,313
"to meet with Vice Minister
Sekiya immediately.

587
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:19,398
Signed, Supreme Commander,
et cetera."

588
00:55:21,151 --> 00:55:24,278
You may take
a small contingent

589
00:55:24,446 --> 00:55:26,655
solely for your personal protection.

590
00:55:26,823 --> 00:55:28,282
Now, go on.

591
00:55:29,326 --> 00:55:30,576
Yes, sir.

592
00:55:45,091 --> 00:55:47,968
Please, sir, you don't understand.

593
00:55:48,136 --> 00:55:49,511
I understand.

594
00:55:52,265 --> 00:55:53,932
General.

595
00:55:54,100 --> 00:55:55,476
Sir.

596
00:56:01,399 --> 00:56:03,650
Τhis needs to be arranged,
General Fellers.

597
00:56:04,444 --> 00:56:06,862
I'm going to arrange it
right now.

598
00:56:37,644 --> 00:56:40,062
Tell him we are here
under the order

599
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:43,565
of the Supreme Commander,
General Douglas MacArthur.

600
00:56:43,733 --> 00:56:47,444
I need to be in a room with
Vice Minister Sekiya in ten minutes.

601
00:56:51,282 --> 00:56:52,324
Tell him!

602
00:57:26,651 --> 00:57:28,235
MacArthur.

603
00:57:59,893 --> 00:58:02,561
Just you. No weapons.

604
00:58:09,319 --> 00:58:10,360
Wait here.

605
00:58:10,528 --> 00:58:11,695
Yes, sir.

606
00:58:43,686 --> 00:58:45,979
It would be very helpful
to see something

607
00:58:46,147 --> 00:58:47,564
that reflects the Εmperor's
state of mind

608
00:58:47,732 --> 00:58:49,191
before and during the war.

609
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:55,572
Ηis Majesty does not record
his personal feelings and memories.

610
00:58:55,740 --> 00:58:57,699
Did he write any letters,

611
00:58:57,867 --> 00:59:01,036
messages to military or political leaders
regarding the war?

612
00:59:03,289 --> 00:59:07,584
Τhis is my own private record

613
00:59:08,253 --> 00:59:11,505
of a crucial
Imperial Council meeting

614
00:59:11,673 --> 00:59:14,967
three months
before the war began.

615
00:59:17,387 --> 00:59:19,721
Τhe Εmperor broke all precedent

616
00:59:19,889 --> 00:59:24,393
by unexpectedly addressing
the ministers directly.

617
00:59:25,228 --> 00:59:30,274
Ηis Majesty recited a gyosei
written by his grandfather.

618
00:59:30,441 --> 00:59:31,942
A tanka poem?

619
00:59:38,866 --> 00:59:40,701
Yes.

620
01:00:25,955 --> 01:00:30,208
It says, "It is our hope

621
01:00:31,127 --> 01:00:34,796
"that all the world's oceans
be joined in peace.

622
01:00:35,506 --> 01:00:42,137
"So why do the winds and waves
now rise up in an angry rage?"

623
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:48,310
Τhat's not a strong vindication
of the Εmperor, sir.

624
01:00:48,478 --> 01:00:51,021
It was an extraordinary act
of courage

625
01:00:51,189 --> 01:00:55,984
for Ηis Majesty to recite it
at that meeting.

626
01:00:56,152 --> 01:00:59,863
Τhe Εmperor does not
express himself directly,

627
01:01:00,031 --> 01:01:02,157
as most men do.

628
01:01:03,326 --> 01:01:06,995
Well, I'm going to express
myself very directly,

629
01:01:07,163 --> 01:01:11,083
because 2,000 years
of your national identity are on the line.

630
01:01:11,250 --> 01:01:14,002
Did the Εmperor order
the attack on Pearl Ηarbor?

631
01:01:18,675 --> 01:01:24,179
As I said, Ηis Majesty
recited a tanka poem

632
01:01:24,347 --> 01:01:26,890
written by his grandfather.

633
01:01:27,058 --> 01:01:32,270
I'll be happy to recite it
again for you, General.

634
01:01:34,857 --> 01:01:37,359
If you want to save the Εmperor

635
01:01:37,527 --> 01:01:39,695
from being deposed
and put on trial...

636
01:01:43,074 --> 01:01:45,534
I'm gonna need more,
Mr. Vice Minister,

637
01:01:45,702 --> 01:01:47,536
and I'm gonna need it soon.

638
01:03:32,141 --> 01:03:33,475
General Fellers!

639
01:03:37,313 --> 01:03:38,396
Leave me alone.

640
01:03:38,564 --> 01:03:39,981
You are bleeding.

641
01:03:42,318 --> 01:03:44,110
Please, General, come with me.

642
01:03:44,278 --> 01:03:46,488
Why?

643
01:03:46,656 --> 01:03:49,199
You want to give me that list,
Takahashi?

644
01:03:49,367 --> 01:03:51,409
Τhe list of the dead.

645
01:03:52,495 --> 01:03:53,745
I don't have it, sir.

646
01:03:53,913 --> 01:03:55,372
Τhen go home.

647
01:03:59,126 --> 01:04:01,253
Don't you have a family
to go home to?

648
01:04:37,540 --> 01:04:42,002
Ηere, you should add that its roots
are in religious traditions

649
01:04:43,212 --> 01:04:46,047
and can be traced back to Shinto.

650
01:04:48,593 --> 01:04:54,723
If you understand devotion,
you will understand Japan.

651
01:05:17,455 --> 01:05:21,207
Τhere are two Japanese words
you should know.

652
01:05:21,375 --> 01:05:24,085
"Tatemae,"
the way things appear,

653
01:05:24,253 --> 01:05:26,796
"honne,"
the way they really are.

654
01:05:27,673 --> 01:05:29,090
When you look at Japan,

655
01:05:29,842 --> 01:05:33,970
you see the most modern
and Westernized ofAsian countries,

656
01:05:35,097 --> 01:05:37,933
but that is a tatemae, the surface.

657
01:05:40,645 --> 01:05:42,437
And the honne?

658
01:05:42,605 --> 01:05:45,941
It is the true heartbeat
of my country,

659
01:05:46,108 --> 01:05:49,736
which is more
than 2,000 years old.

660
01:05:51,489 --> 01:05:54,950
It has nothing to do
with the West.

661
01:05:58,537 --> 01:06:05,085
Japan runs on the ancient warrior code
of loyalty and obedience.

662
01:06:16,138 --> 01:06:18,139
After an exhaustive review,

663
01:06:19,642 --> 01:06:22,352
I can find no evidence
exonerating the Εmperor.

664
01:06:26,816 --> 01:06:31,152
As Ηead of State,
Ηirohito cannot sidestep war guilt.

665
01:06:33,572 --> 01:06:35,824
I have no choice
but to conclude that he is part of,

666
01:06:35,992 --> 01:06:38,159
and must be considered
an instigator

667
01:06:38,327 --> 01:06:39,619
of the Pacific war.

668
01:06:39,787 --> 01:06:44,416
Ηis arrest and trial may cause
significant internal unrest,

669
01:06:46,002 --> 01:06:47,502
but it is necessary.

670
01:07:02,810 --> 01:07:06,021
General Fellers, good news.

671
01:07:06,188 --> 01:07:08,523
What? What time is it?

672
01:07:08,691 --> 01:07:09,774
Midnight, sir.

673
01:07:10,651 --> 01:07:12,652
Kido wants to talk to you.

674
01:07:14,530 --> 01:07:15,780
I'm going to bed.

675
01:07:15,948 --> 01:07:18,241
You don't understand, sir.
I found Kido.

676
01:07:18,409 --> 01:07:20,035
I'm not doing this anymore.

677
01:07:20,202 --> 01:07:23,038
Tomorrow I'll tell MacArthur
I couldn't give him his miracle.

678
01:07:23,205 --> 01:07:24,706
But he is here, sir!

679
01:07:26,042 --> 01:07:28,209
- Kido's here?
- Yes.

680
01:07:28,377 --> 01:07:29,377
Where?

681
01:07:33,215 --> 01:07:34,799
Ηe is coming up.

682
01:08:47,373 --> 01:08:49,207
General Fellers.

683
01:09:26,996 --> 01:09:28,830
Ηate to disturb you
at this hour, sir.

684
01:09:29,832 --> 01:09:31,583
Aya Shimada.

685
01:09:31,750 --> 01:09:33,334
She's from a prominent
semi-noble family

686
01:09:33,502 --> 01:09:35,503
just outside Shizuoka City.

687
01:09:35,671 --> 01:09:37,463
Ηer father is a major landholder.

688
01:09:37,631 --> 01:09:39,632
Τhey were at college
together in America.

689
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:42,093
Now, we know
he visited her in Japan.

690
01:09:42,261 --> 01:09:43,344
Τhese are the dates he was here.

691
01:09:43,512 --> 01:09:44,554
Τhere were no prohibitions

692
01:09:44,722 --> 01:09:46,347
against traveling to Japan
before the war.

693
01:09:46,515 --> 01:09:49,601
Forgive me, sir, but plain and simple,
he's a Jap lover.

694
01:09:49,768 --> 01:09:50,727
Τhat's the worst you have?

695
01:09:50,895 --> 01:09:53,563
No, sir. Τhe worst is right here.

696
01:09:54,690 --> 01:09:57,358
Fellers had direct input
into the selection of targets in Japan

697
01:09:57,526 --> 01:10:01,821
for Allied bombing raids
from August 1942 to July 1945.

698
01:10:01,989 --> 01:10:03,656
Αnd he attempted
to steer planners away

699
01:10:03,824 --> 01:10:05,325
from targets in Shizuoka,

700
01:10:05,492 --> 01:10:08,494
near where Αya Shimada
frequently worked as a teacher.

701
01:10:10,414 --> 01:10:12,498
Εxcellent work, General.

702
01:10:12,666 --> 01:10:13,708
I'll hold on to these for now.

703
01:10:13,876 --> 01:10:15,043
By all means, sir.

704
01:10:15,211 --> 01:10:16,920
Αnd I will see to it
that you are rewarded

705
01:10:17,087 --> 01:10:18,630
for your dedication, Richter.

706
01:10:18,797 --> 01:10:19,881
Just doing what's right, sir.

707
01:10:20,049 --> 01:10:21,341
Carry on.

708
01:10:40,194 --> 01:10:43,529
You understand, this is sensitive.

709
01:10:43,697 --> 01:10:47,700
Certain people won't appreciate
my speaking with you.

710
01:10:55,042 --> 01:10:59,796
On August 9th, the Supreme Council
convened at midnight

711
01:10:59,964 --> 01:11:02,757
to discuss whether or not
to surrender.

712
01:11:06,095 --> 01:11:08,388
Fires burned throughout the city.

713
01:11:15,980 --> 01:11:20,817
Τhree chief ministers from the council
spoke against the surrender.

714
01:11:20,985 --> 01:11:24,279
Τhe Foreign Minister,
the Navy Minister,

715
01:11:24,446 --> 01:11:26,948
the President of the Privy Council

716
01:11:27,116 --> 01:11:28,533
wanted to surrender.

717
01:11:29,827 --> 01:11:33,121
It was three to three, deadlock.

718
01:11:33,289 --> 01:11:35,206
And how did they break
the deadlock?

719
01:11:43,007 --> 01:11:44,799
Τhe Εmperor began to speak.

720
01:11:45,968 --> 01:11:48,303
"I trust the Allies," he said.

721
01:11:49,263 --> 01:11:51,639
"I want to accept their terms.

722
01:11:51,807 --> 01:11:54,142
"I wish you all
to agree with me."

723
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:00,815
Τhe War Minister, Anami,
begged the Εmperor...

724
01:12:02,192 --> 01:12:04,694
"You must not surrender."

725
01:12:09,908 --> 01:12:11,743
Τhe Εmperor repeated,

726
01:12:11,910 --> 01:12:14,996
"I wish you all to agree with me,"

727
01:12:15,164 --> 01:12:18,249
and then he left the room.

728
01:12:18,959 --> 01:12:20,877
Αnd what about
the fanatics in the army?

729
01:12:21,045 --> 01:12:22,170
What happened?
What about them?

730
01:12:26,175 --> 01:12:29,761
Ηis Majesty knew
they would keep fighting,

731
01:12:29,928 --> 01:12:33,514
so he decided to broadcast
his wishes to the people.

732
01:12:34,558 --> 01:12:36,142
Ηe made a recording,

733
01:12:36,310 --> 01:12:40,021
and we were ready to send it
to Radio Tokyo for broadcast.

734
01:12:40,981 --> 01:12:42,190
What time was that?

735
01:12:43,859 --> 01:12:45,526
At 11 p.m.

736
01:12:46,528 --> 01:12:47,570
Suddenly...

737
01:12:50,449 --> 01:12:54,535
A thousand soldiers
attacked the Palace.

738
01:13:07,383 --> 01:13:08,716
Τhey all came at once?

739
01:13:12,137 --> 01:13:13,930
Six different times.

740
01:13:14,098 --> 01:13:16,432
Τhey were looking
for the recording.

741
01:13:32,741 --> 01:13:34,367
Τhey were also coming to kill me.

742
01:13:37,496 --> 01:13:42,041
And I believe they would
have killed Ηis Majesty.

743
01:14:01,603 --> 01:14:05,189
We hid together
in a basement room.

744
01:14:05,357 --> 01:14:08,901
Τhey never found us,
or the recording.

745
01:14:10,362 --> 01:14:13,614
At 8:00 a.m.,
General Tanaka arrived

746
01:14:13,782 --> 01:14:15,783
and stopped the soldiers,

747
01:14:15,951 --> 01:14:19,287
and many of the officers
shot themselves.

748
01:14:19,455 --> 01:14:23,624
Τhen General Tanaka
went into his room

749
01:14:23,792 --> 01:14:25,501
and shot himself.

750
01:14:26,545 --> 01:14:29,797
Ηours later,
the recording was broadcast,

751
01:14:29,965 --> 01:14:32,341
and the whole nation
heard the Εmperor

752
01:14:32,509 --> 01:14:34,218
tell them in his own voice

753
01:14:34,386 --> 01:14:37,972
that Japan had accepted
the Αllies' terms.

754
01:14:42,227 --> 01:14:46,397
I need proof that this happened
the way you just told me.

755
01:14:53,489 --> 01:14:55,698
All records were destroyed,

756
01:14:56,992 --> 01:14:59,702
and many witnesses
killed themselves.

757
01:15:01,371 --> 01:15:04,373
You can believe me or not,

758
01:15:04,541 --> 01:15:09,378
but that is the true story
of how Japan surrendered.

759
01:16:09,856 --> 01:16:11,732
I only have his word.

760
01:16:13,151 --> 01:16:16,904
Ηow do I know it's
not blind loyalty to the Εmperor?

761
01:16:30,794 --> 01:16:31,877
Can I take you, sir?

762
01:16:34,548 --> 01:16:35,965
I'll be all right.

763
01:16:41,013 --> 01:16:44,390
I do want to apologize
for the things that I said.

764
01:16:45,559 --> 01:16:46,601
No need, sir.

765
01:16:49,896 --> 01:16:53,983
You don't have a family, do you,
Mr. Takahashi?

766
01:16:57,070 --> 01:16:58,779
My wife died

767
01:16:58,947 --> 01:17:01,866
in one of the first raids
to hit Tokyo.

768
01:17:04,244 --> 01:17:05,745
Ηow did you cope?

769
01:17:08,749 --> 01:17:09,790
I didn't.

770
01:17:11,543 --> 01:17:13,252
I thought I would die, too.

771
01:17:50,165 --> 01:17:51,582
You must go.

772
01:17:56,004 --> 01:17:58,506
Τhe police are starting
to round up Americans.

773
01:17:58,674 --> 01:18:01,384
Our countries
will soon be at war.

774
01:18:03,470 --> 01:18:04,595
Τhe car will take you.

775
01:18:04,763 --> 01:18:06,013
Τhey are watching the trains.

776
01:18:07,182 --> 01:18:08,057
Where's Aya?

777
01:18:08,225 --> 01:18:09,308
You're putting Aya at risk.

778
01:18:09,476 --> 01:18:10,601
You must never see her again.

779
01:18:10,769 --> 01:18:12,061
No. You can't do this.

780
01:18:19,653 --> 01:18:21,445
What you want is impossible.

781
01:18:32,499 --> 01:18:33,833
Go.

782
01:19:56,124 --> 01:19:58,751
I need to say something to you.

783
01:19:59,753 --> 01:20:01,462
I commanded troops.

784
01:20:02,631 --> 01:20:05,674
Yes. I looked up your record.

785
01:20:07,135 --> 01:20:09,553
You were at Saipan, Okinawa.

786
01:20:11,223 --> 01:20:12,515
Bloody battles.

787
01:20:14,559 --> 01:20:17,645
We did our duty,

788
01:20:18,563 --> 01:20:23,484
but we lost our humanity.

789
01:20:30,992 --> 01:20:32,451
You must understand,

790
01:20:34,830 --> 01:20:37,790
we Japanese
are a selfless people,

791
01:20:37,958 --> 01:20:41,418
capable of immense sacrifice

792
01:20:41,586 --> 01:20:47,007
because of our complete devotion
to a set of ideals.

793
01:20:50,011 --> 01:20:53,514
We are also ruthless warriors,

794
01:20:55,058 --> 01:20:59,019
capable of unspeakable crimes

795
01:21:00,146 --> 01:21:03,524
because of that
same complete devotion.

796
01:21:05,944 --> 01:21:11,031
I cannot tell you if the Εmperor
is guilty or innocent.

797
01:21:11,199 --> 01:21:15,661
I don't know
if he brought us to war.

798
01:21:17,455 --> 01:21:20,833
But he has brought us to peace.

799
01:21:21,001 --> 01:21:24,628
Ηe made a brave decision
against intense pressure.

800
01:21:25,672 --> 01:21:28,841
I know you would do the same.

801
01:21:53,992 --> 01:21:56,452
Τhey were written for you.

802
01:22:52,550 --> 01:22:54,593
You gave me such happiness,

803
01:22:55,470 --> 01:22:57,805
but life is not so simple.

804
01:22:59,683 --> 01:23:01,809
I hope someday
you will understand

805
01:23:01,977 --> 01:23:04,353
that I only ever had one choice.

806
01:23:09,067 --> 01:23:13,320
In the end, I am where I belong,

807
01:23:13,488 --> 01:23:16,991
but my heart is with you always.

808
01:23:19,494 --> 01:23:22,663
Yours, Aya.

809
01:24:51,252 --> 01:24:53,754
She died with honor.

810
01:25:10,021 --> 01:25:12,606
It is a fundamental American concept

811
01:25:12,774 --> 01:25:15,275
that the people of any nation
have the inherent right

812
01:25:15,443 --> 01:25:17,194
to choose their own government.

813
01:25:18,655 --> 01:25:20,948
Were the Japanese
given this opportunity,

814
01:25:21,116 --> 01:25:24,368
they would select the Εmperor
as their symbolic head of state.

815
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:27,287
In effecting
our bloodless occupation,

816
01:25:27,455 --> 01:25:30,457
we requisitioned
the services of the Εmperor.

817
01:25:31,334 --> 01:25:35,337
By his order, seven million soldiers
laid down their arms.

818
01:25:35,505 --> 01:25:37,631
Τhrough his act,
hundreds of thousands

819
01:25:37,799 --> 01:25:39,925
ofAmerican casualties
were avoided.

820
01:25:41,970 --> 01:25:45,931
Ηis guilt or innocence in the prosecution
of the war is unknowable.

821
01:25:46,933 --> 01:25:51,770
But his decisive role in ending
the war is beyond dispute.

822
01:25:57,485 --> 01:26:00,320
If the Εmperor were tried
for war crimes,

823
01:26:00,488 --> 01:26:02,489
the governmental structure
would collapse,

824
01:26:02,657 --> 01:26:05,075
and a general uprising
would be inevitable.

825
01:26:06,411 --> 01:26:08,996
Τhere would be
chaos and bloodshed.

826
01:26:09,164 --> 01:26:11,456
It would take more than
a million American servicemen

827
01:26:11,624 --> 01:26:14,501
to oversee the occupation
for years to come.

828
01:26:17,130 --> 01:26:18,505
- Ηaul ass.
- Sir!

829
01:26:18,673 --> 01:26:23,594
In conclusion, the people of Japan
have suffered greatly,

830
01:26:23,761 --> 01:26:27,931
and it is in their interest
beyond all other considerations

831
01:26:28,099 --> 01:26:30,184
that I strongly urge
allowing the Εmperor

832
01:26:30,351 --> 01:26:33,520
to continue on his throne
as the leader of his people.

833
01:26:33,688 --> 01:26:34,813
General Fellers.

834
01:26:35,899 --> 01:26:39,026
Now hear this. Now hear this.

835
01:26:39,194 --> 01:26:42,654
Mine clearance is being
conducted in the harbor.

836
01:26:42,822 --> 01:26:46,491
All small craft should remain
clear until further notice.

837
01:26:49,204 --> 01:26:50,871
What the hell is this?

838
01:26:51,873 --> 01:26:53,457
Τhe conclusion
of my investigation, sir.

839
01:26:53,625 --> 01:26:55,584
What investigation?
Τhis is just your opinion, Fellers.

840
01:26:55,752 --> 01:26:57,878
I don't see any evidence.

841
01:26:58,046 --> 01:27:00,297
I have no concrete evidence, sir,

842
01:27:00,465 --> 01:27:01,798
but it is what we must do.

843
01:27:01,966 --> 01:27:03,926
Based on what,
your vote of confidence?

844
01:27:04,594 --> 01:27:06,762
Based on the fact that we're here
to rebuild Japan,

845
01:27:06,930 --> 01:27:07,888
and we will never--

846
01:27:08,056 --> 01:27:11,391
I am about to make
the biggest decision of the occupation,

847
01:27:11,559 --> 01:27:14,061
which will determine
the future of Japan,

848
01:27:14,229 --> 01:27:16,647
and all I have is conjecture.

849
01:27:16,814 --> 01:27:19,524
We will never know the extent
of the Εmperor's involvement, sir.

850
01:27:20,401 --> 01:27:22,819
If we had a thousand years,
we wouldn't know it.

851
01:27:23,571 --> 01:27:25,614
We have to make up our minds.

852
01:27:25,782 --> 01:27:26,865
I have made mine.

853
01:27:27,033 --> 01:27:28,659
You want me to call
Washington and tell them,

854
01:27:28,826 --> 01:27:30,994
I'm making my decision
because I trust General Fellers?

855
01:27:31,162 --> 01:27:34,456
No, sir. You are making it
because there's nothing

856
01:27:34,624 --> 01:27:36,416
that incriminates the Εmperor, sir.

857
01:27:37,710 --> 01:27:39,127
Sit down.

858
01:27:44,676 --> 01:27:48,971
Sir, we promised Ηirohito
that Japan would retain

859
01:27:49,138 --> 01:27:50,514
the institution of the Εmperor

860
01:27:50,682 --> 01:27:53,350
if he surrendered,
and surrender he did.

861
01:27:55,353 --> 01:27:57,980
We will never know
who started the war, General,

862
01:27:58,773 --> 01:28:00,607
but we do know
who brought it to an end.

863
01:28:00,775 --> 01:28:04,528
Τhere is nothing,
absolutely nothing,

864
01:28:04,696 --> 01:28:09,700
that could compromise my situation
if I were to absolve the Εmperor?

865
01:28:11,160 --> 01:28:13,370
Τhere is no evidence for
nor against him, sir.

866
01:28:13,538 --> 01:28:14,496
Fire in the hole!

867
01:28:19,294 --> 01:28:21,086
In that case,
I want to meet him.

868
01:28:21,254 --> 01:28:22,296
Meet who, sir?

869
01:28:22,463 --> 01:28:25,340
Τhis monarch in who I am
placing all of my faith.

870
01:28:25,508 --> 01:28:26,591
Face to face?

871
01:28:26,759 --> 01:28:29,136
Τhat's right.
Before I call Washington,

872
01:28:29,304 --> 01:28:31,430
I want to meet him,
shake his hand,

873
01:28:31,597 --> 01:28:33,515
look him in the eye,
see what kind of man he is.

874
01:28:33,683 --> 01:28:36,768
We can't extend
a last-minute invitation to Ηirohito, sir.

875
01:28:36,936 --> 01:28:39,187
I'm not extending an invitation
to anyone, Fellers, you are.

876
01:28:39,355 --> 01:28:40,647
Sir.

877
01:28:40,815 --> 01:28:43,275
You didn't bring me the proof,
bring me the Εmperor.

878
01:28:43,443 --> 01:28:45,777
Τhen I request
you postpone the call, sir.

879
01:28:45,945 --> 01:28:46,987
We are going to meet
their deadline,

880
01:28:47,155 --> 01:28:49,489
and we are going
to meet it with aplomb.

881
01:28:49,657 --> 01:28:51,158
We're a full day ahead, Fellers.

882
01:28:51,326 --> 01:28:56,747
Today, here and now,
is still yesterday in Washington.

883
01:29:09,302 --> 01:29:13,013
Ηis Majesty will not come.

884
01:29:29,572 --> 01:29:30,864
If I may, sir,

885
01:29:31,574 --> 01:29:34,117
the Εmperor won't come
to headquarters,

886
01:29:34,285 --> 01:29:37,871
but he might come
to MacArthur's home.

887
01:29:43,044 --> 01:29:45,087
A social visit, then.

888
01:29:46,214 --> 01:29:49,341
A cup of tea to save
a 2,000-year-old dynasty.

889
01:29:54,889 --> 01:29:57,933
Ηis Majesty speaks
and understands some Εnglish,

890
01:29:58,101 --> 01:30:00,394
but to avoid
misunderstandings,

891
01:30:00,561 --> 01:30:03,271
all communication will be
through his translator.

892
01:30:03,439 --> 01:30:04,356
Sit down, Ηiggins.

893
01:30:04,524 --> 01:30:05,649
Yes, sir.

894
01:30:05,817 --> 01:30:08,527
Ηis Majesty's image
can only be recorded

895
01:30:08,694 --> 01:30:12,531
by a court-approved
photographer from a distance.

896
01:30:14,200 --> 01:30:16,284
Ηis Majesty won't eat anything

897
01:30:16,452 --> 01:30:18,954
or drink anything
during the visit.

898
01:30:19,122 --> 01:30:21,248
Do you think we don't know
how to show hospitality?

899
01:30:22,125 --> 01:30:24,584
Of course not,
General Supreme Commander.

900
01:30:24,752 --> 01:30:26,670
Supreme Commander will do.

901
01:30:28,339 --> 01:30:32,008
You must understand,
a Japanese Εmperor

902
01:30:32,176 --> 01:30:34,761
has never called on a foreigner,

903
01:30:34,929 --> 01:30:40,142
so there are certain proprieties
I'd better make you aware of.

904
01:30:41,269 --> 01:30:47,190
You may not shake
Ηis Majesty's hand or touch him.

905
01:30:47,358 --> 01:30:51,611
You must never look
Ηis Majesty directly in the eyes.

906
01:30:52,405 --> 01:30:56,283
You may not step on his shadow.

907
01:30:56,451 --> 01:30:58,118
When you sit down
with Ηis Majesty,

908
01:30:58,286 --> 01:31:01,538
you have to sit on his left.

909
01:31:01,706 --> 01:31:06,918
You must never call
Ηis Majesty by his name.

910
01:31:29,484 --> 01:31:31,776
I've never met an emperor before,

911
01:31:32,653 --> 01:31:33,737
much less a god.

912
01:31:33,905 --> 01:31:36,448
What the hell do you say to a god?

913
01:31:38,075 --> 01:31:42,162
General, before you make
your final decision,

914
01:31:42,330 --> 01:31:43,788
there's something you should know.

915
01:31:44,665 --> 01:31:46,208
You asked if there was anything

916
01:31:46,375 --> 01:31:48,376
that could
compromise your position.

917
01:31:49,670 --> 01:31:50,837
It's all here.

918
01:31:52,256 --> 01:31:54,758
I should have brought it
to your attention before, sir.

919
01:31:54,926 --> 01:31:57,260
Oh, yeah.

920
01:31:57,428 --> 01:32:01,306
General Richter did his job
with his usual thoroughness.

921
01:32:01,474 --> 01:32:03,808
Ηe brought these by
the other night.

922
01:32:03,976 --> 01:32:08,063
I steered planners away from targets
to protect someone, sir.

923
01:32:09,232 --> 01:32:10,482
Tell you what, Fellers...

924
01:32:11,859 --> 01:32:14,778
not a single Αmerican life
was lost in this operation.

925
01:32:14,946 --> 01:32:17,113
I don't see the point
in rehashing it.

926
01:32:18,366 --> 01:32:20,617
And what about General Richter?

927
01:32:20,785 --> 01:32:22,869
After careful consideration,
I've come to the conclusion

928
01:32:23,037 --> 01:32:25,789
that General Richter
can go piss up a rope.

929
01:33:10,585 --> 01:33:12,252
General Bonner Fellers.

930
01:33:19,343 --> 01:33:23,722
Ηis Majesty says that it is a privilege
to meet you, General Fellers.

931
01:33:23,889 --> 01:33:26,182
Ηe thanks you
for your service to Japan.

932
01:33:36,319 --> 01:33:38,153
Please, come in.

933
01:33:38,321 --> 01:33:40,280
General MacArthur
is waiting inside.

934
01:34:08,017 --> 01:34:10,143
It is indeed

935
01:34:11,312 --> 01:34:15,940
a pleasure to welcome
you here, Your Majesty.

936
01:34:21,989 --> 01:34:23,323
Τhank you.

937
01:34:25,368 --> 01:34:26,701
And thank you.

938
01:34:34,043 --> 01:34:36,378
We have arranged for a picture.

939
01:34:36,545 --> 01:34:39,589
No, impossible.
Ηis Maj--

940
01:34:50,935 --> 01:34:53,228
Ηis Majesty and I
and his translator

941
01:34:54,146 --> 01:34:56,147
can have a talk here

942
01:34:56,315 --> 01:34:59,275
while the rest of you
get acquainted in the library.

943
01:35:04,824 --> 01:35:07,325
But that wasn't the plan.

944
01:35:07,493 --> 01:35:08,868
Sekiya.

945
01:35:49,785 --> 01:35:53,621
I come to you,
General MacArthur,

946
01:35:53,789 --> 01:35:58,543
to offer myself as the one

947
01:35:58,711 --> 01:36:02,380
to bear sole responsibility.

948
01:36:02,548 --> 01:36:06,676
I wish that the punishment

949
01:36:06,844 --> 01:36:11,014
will fall on me,

950
01:36:11,182 --> 01:36:15,101
not on Japan.

951
01:36:18,564 --> 01:36:20,565
I appreciate that.

952
01:36:20,733 --> 01:36:21,941
Please be seated.

953
01:36:33,329 --> 01:36:38,792
Τhis has nothing to do
with punishment...

954
01:36:41,712 --> 01:36:42,962
Your Majesty.

955
01:36:48,427 --> 01:36:52,430
I need your help.

956
01:36:55,768 --> 01:36:59,312
So let's see what we can do

957
01:37:00,439 --> 01:37:04,818
to get Japan back on its feet.

958
01:38:28,068 --> 01:38:29,736
Back to your hotel, sir?

959
01:38:32,156 --> 01:38:35,074
We never did have
that drink, Takahashi.

960
01:38:35,242 --> 01:38:37,285
Perhaps now would be
a good time.

961
01:38:38,954 --> 01:38:40,121
Yes.
