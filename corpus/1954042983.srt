1
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:02,105
Like the song says,

2
00:01:02,352 --> 00:01:05,365
Santa knows who's been naughty
and who's been nice.

3
00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:09,569
Make it on the Nice List, and you can
expect a visit from Prep and Landing.

4
00:01:11,652 --> 00:01:13,289
But end up on the Naughty List,

5
00:01:13,821 --> 00:01:16,454
well, then get ready
for a whole different crew.

6
00:01:17,491 --> 00:01:18,783
The Coal Elf Brigade.

7
00:01:39,677 --> 00:01:42,689
Their job, confirm and deliver.

8
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:50,563
Their goal, to rehabilitate children
one lump of coal at a time.

9
00:01:51,855 --> 00:01:53,065
These guys are tough.

10
00:01:54,189 --> 00:01:57,322
Always prepared
for those naughty kids.

11
00:01:57,901 --> 00:01:59,953
Well, almost always.

12
00:02:16,293 --> 00:02:17,336
Look out!

13
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:26,850
Good dog.

14
00:02:31,056 --> 00:02:32,183
All right. Yes. Good.

15
00:02:32,849 --> 00:02:34,735
No, no, no! Just get it done!

16
00:02:34,934 --> 00:02:36,939
If those turtle doves aren't cleared
off the runway, believe me,

17
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:38,443
Dancer will swallow one on take-off.

18
00:02:39,271 --> 00:02:42,036
Ice blocks!
Book 30 minutes at Spa Navidad.

19
00:02:42,107 --> 00:02:44,527
If Renato is available, make it an hour.

20
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:46,579
Okay, Mr. Thistleton, come on.
T-minus three days.

21
00:02:46,653 --> 00:02:47,826
Give me some good news, baby.

22
00:02:47,904 --> 00:02:52,578
Happy to oblige, baby. I mean, Magee!
Of course. Why did I say that?

23
00:02:52,742 --> 00:02:54,663
Naughty and Nice List servers
are online,

24
00:02:54,744 --> 00:02:56,297
protective firewalls are in place,

25
00:02:56,370 --> 00:03:00,213
and we are processing behavioural data
from around the world as we speak.

26
00:03:00,666 --> 00:03:04,047
It appears we may have a record
number of nice children this year.

27
00:03:24,812 --> 00:03:27,777
Someone is being very naughty.

28
00:03:28,899 --> 00:03:31,319
I've been really nice this year.

29
00:03:32,402 --> 00:03:33,494
What the heck? I'll take it!

30
00:03:33,987 --> 00:03:38,578
- Well, that is holly jolly, sir.
-Hey, Wayne! Done shopping!

31
00:03:39,951 --> 00:03:41,422
Got any of those beaded seat covers?

32
00:03:41,493 --> 00:03:45,170
I'm heading home to trim the tree
with my family. You wanna come?

33
00:03:45,872 --> 00:03:49,715
Thanks, Lanny, but this new Natale
is all the family I need.

34
00:03:50,001 --> 00:03:51,554
It's a Turbo!

35
00:03:51,627 --> 00:03:53,050
Hey, you think you can
take out the passenger seat?

36
00:03:53,963 --> 00:03:55,683
I got it.

37
00:03:55,757 --> 00:03:58,140
Wayne! Code Red!

38
00:03:58,675 --> 00:04:00,597
Cranberry Red!

39
00:04:00,802 --> 00:04:03,270
Gene, I'll be right back! Do not sell it!

40
00:04:03,846 --> 00:04:06,979
Sorry to drag you boys away
from your little shopping spree,

41
00:04:07,058 --> 00:04:09,027
but we have a situation. Mr. Thistleton?

42
00:04:09,393 --> 00:04:12,157
Yes, we have recently discovered
that last year,

43
00:04:12,228 --> 00:04:15,941
a Fruitcake Conduct Calculator
fell into the hands of a naughty child

44
00:04:16,024 --> 00:04:20,828
with the nefarious screen name,
Jinglesmell1337.

45
00:04:21,488 --> 00:04:22,531
Great garland!

46
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:25,628
Using our stolen technology,
the juvenile is attempting

47
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:29,211
to ascertain the password to the
Naughty and Nice List database.

48
00:04:30,119 --> 00:04:32,042
And that we cannot allow.

49
00:04:32,539 --> 00:04:34,176
On a personal note, I'd like to add

50
00:04:34,249 --> 00:04:36,170
that my superior intellect
and! take umbrage...

51
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:37,377
Got it. Thanks, Smart Guy.

52
00:04:38,544 --> 00:04:40,763
Tiny, we almost there?

53
00:04:41,547 --> 00:04:44,264
- So that's why the Big Guy wants...
-Yeah, okay, okay.

54
00:04:44,341 --> 00:04:46,013
I know what you're gonna ask.

55
00:04:46,385 --> 00:04:48,223
Will The Prep and Landing guy

56
00:04:48,303 --> 00:04:52,644
step forth in the face of crisis
and retrieve that Fruitcake?

57
00:04:52,723 --> 00:04:56,733
Yes. Yes, he will. He'd be honoured.

58
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:59,481
Waynie, Wayne, you are adorable.

59
00:04:59,855 --> 00:05:01,575
But how to put this?

60
00:05:01,647 --> 00:05:04,068
The Big Guy thinks
you need a little more help.

61
00:05:04,359 --> 00:05:05,700
A Naughty Kid Field Expert.

62
00:05:06,402 --> 00:05:08,288
Wait, what? You mean a Coal Elf?

63
00:05:08,571 --> 00:05:11,952
He'll meet you at Christmas Carol's.
I'm sure everything will be fine.

64
00:05:12,032 --> 00:05:13,953
Don't hate me.
Floor it, Tiny. Okay, bye!

65
00:05:14,326 --> 00:05:16,295
A Coal Elf? Tinsel!

66
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:18,414
We don't need any help.

67
00:05:20,206 --> 00:05:23,718
Naughty, naughty children
Better start acting nice

68
00:05:25,628 --> 00:05:27,679
Naughty, naughty children
Better start...

69
00:05:27,754 --> 00:05:29,142
Fifteen minutes late.

70
00:05:29,214 --> 00:05:32,892
This Naughty Kid Field Expert,
no expert on time.

71
00:05:36,262 --> 00:05:37,354
Thank you, sir!

72
00:05:40,641 --> 00:05:42,231
But, ma'am... Ma'am!

73
00:05:42,559 --> 00:05:44,232
I mean, lady?

74
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:50,530
Hey, you know,
that's gonna be me. Yeah.

75
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:52,535
- What's that?
-The Elf of the Year.

76
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:56,785
Hey, aren't you that
Preps and Landing guy? Dwayne, is it?

77
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:59,829
It's Wayne. And, indeed, I am.

78
00:05:59,908 --> 00:06:03,751
Hey, everybody!
It's Dwayne from Preps and Landing!

79
00:06:03,829 --> 00:06:04,920
Hey, I heard of you!

80
00:06:04,996 --> 00:06:06,669
He's gonna be Elf of the Year!

81
00:06:06,747 --> 00:06:09,879
Yeah, I guess I'm here
to save Christmas or something.

82
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:13,304
I'm the Prep and Landing guy, so...
Well, what are you gonna do, huh?

83
00:06:13,378 --> 00:06:18,812
Yeah, I'll be leading this expedition
once our so-called expert arrives.

84
00:06:18,883 --> 00:06:20,436
- He's here!
-It's him! He's here.

85
00:06:23,012 --> 00:06:24,400
Jingle-bam!

86
00:06:28,142 --> 00:06:29,647
That's got to be the expert!

87
00:06:32,312 --> 00:06:33,700
How's everybody doing?

88
00:06:34,355 --> 00:06:35,398
Noel?

89
00:06:37,358 --> 00:06:40,122
Sorry about the mess, there, Carol.

90
00:06:40,194 --> 00:06:44,665
I got all excited. I just dropped
some serious coin on my new Natale.

91
00:06:44,739 --> 00:06:45,831
It's a Turbo!

92
00:06:46,157 --> 00:06:49,170
Hey, Wayne, that looks just like
the snowmobile you were gonna buy.

93
00:06:49,536 --> 00:06:52,121
- Noel?
-Gene said he had another buyer,

94
00:06:52,205 --> 00:06:54,589
but I turned on the old Noel charm.

95
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:55,917
Noel?

96
00:06:56,124 --> 00:07:00,004
And now I'm here to save Christmas.
Jingle-bam!

97
00:07:00,337 --> 00:07:03,718
Hey, that's funny. That's what this
fellow, Dwayne, says he's gonna do.

98
00:07:04,048 --> 00:07:06,219
What? Crumbling coal buckets!

99
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:08,312
- Wayne!
-The name's Dwayne.

100
00:07:08,385 --> 00:07:09,596
Nobody listens to me.

101
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:12,727
March it on over here, little man!
Holiday hug time!

102
00:07:13,098 --> 00:07:15,150
- No, no! No, no! No, no, no.
-Come here, come here. Come here.

103
00:07:15,516 --> 00:07:18,151
- Wayne!
-I love him, I love him, I love him.

104
00:07:18,228 --> 00:07:23,032
- Lanny, this is Noel, my little brother.
-Brother?

105
00:07:26,443 --> 00:07:28,116
You two? Brothers?

106
00:07:28,279 --> 00:07:30,117
Yeah! Finally working together.

107
00:07:30,406 --> 00:07:32,125
- Yeah.
-Hey, you're still looking good.

108
00:07:32,198 --> 00:07:34,333
Even with those extra pounds.

109
00:07:34,409 --> 00:07:36,460
Okay, okay. Listen carefully.

110
00:07:36,619 --> 00:07:39,584
Thrasher, the reindeer,
not exactly sociable.

111
00:07:39,664 --> 00:07:42,047
Whatever you do, say nothing.

112
00:07:45,168 --> 00:07:46,259
Hey, Bambi!

113
00:07:47,462 --> 00:07:48,505
Oh, brother!

114
00:07:48,588 --> 00:07:51,518
I told you if I ever saw you again,
I'd put your head on my wall!

115
00:07:51,841 --> 00:07:54,094
You hairy tub of cookie dough.

116
00:07:54,176 --> 00:07:57,723
Give me one good reason
why I shouldn't destroy you.

117
00:08:03,059 --> 00:08:04,613
Thanks, Noel, you're the best!

118
00:08:05,102 --> 00:08:07,107
Hey, this Friday,
I'm having a little party.

119
00:08:09,607 --> 00:08:11,942
Jingle-bam! Jingle-bam!

120
00:08:13,193 --> 00:08:14,784
No. Jingle-bam!

121
00:08:15,153 --> 00:08:20,041
The key is to really unclench
and bring it all up from the South Pole.

122
00:08:20,116 --> 00:08:22,251
Jingle-bam!

123
00:08:22,326 --> 00:08:23,370
- Yes!
-Yeah!

124
00:08:23,494 --> 00:08:24,965
I like the Yule in your log, partner.

125
00:08:25,413 --> 00:08:26,623
- You keep bringing it.
-Okay.

126
00:08:26,789 --> 00:08:30,668
Hey, Tree Skirt, you know
who Wayne's first partner was?

127
00:08:31,251 --> 00:08:32,425
Me!

128
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:35,760
- Yeah. When we were kids...
-Here we go.

129
00:08:35,838 --> 00:08:38,139
...Wayne would dress up
as Captain Avalanche,

130
00:08:38,465 --> 00:08:40,766
and! was his trusty sidekick, Snowball.

131
00:08:40,843 --> 00:08:41,887
Great garland!

132
00:08:41,969 --> 00:08:45,017
Why, we used to battle
all the enemies of the North Pole.

133
00:08:45,096 --> 00:08:49,818
Like Professor Permafrost
and his Army of Evil Nutcrackers.

134
00:08:49,892 --> 00:08:51,898
- Tinsel!
-Hey, Wayne,

135
00:08:51,978 --> 00:08:55,406
remember when they came out
with Captain Avalanche's Super Sled?

136
00:08:55,605 --> 00:08:58,619
The one with the glacier
grappling hook and zip-line action.

137
00:08:58,859 --> 00:09:01,113
Yeah. I remember that thing.

138
00:09:01,486 --> 00:09:03,704
Man, we sure wanted that sled, huh?

139
00:09:05,072 --> 00:09:06,200
We sure did.

140
00:09:06,365 --> 00:09:10,327
Yeah, too bad that Peterson kid
got the last one, huh?

141
00:09:10,411 --> 00:09:16,128
You cried and cried like a baby.
My big brother. The big baby.

142
00:09:16,249 --> 00:09:18,385
All right, all right, look,
time to exit memory lane.

143
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:19,930
We're on a mission here.

144
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,388
Thrasher, what's our ETA,
big fella? Over.

145
00:09:23,464 --> 00:09:27,343
Do not question me, Dwayne!
I tell you when we're over the drop zone.

146
00:09:28,509 --> 00:09:32,270
Noel, we are over the drop zone.
You go save Christmas, buddy.

147
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:35,735
Okay, Lanny,
time for an equipment check.

148
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:37,523
- Parachutes?
-Check.

149
00:09:37,643 --> 00:09:38,936
- Sparkle?
-Check.

150
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:41,439
- Here's my sparkle.
-Check it out!

151
00:09:41,521 --> 00:09:43,408
This ain't no cotillion, ladies.

152
00:09:43,482 --> 00:09:46,660
We'll need Little Miss Sweet Dreams
here for this naughty kid.

153
00:09:46,734 --> 00:09:47,945
Jingle-bam!

154
00:09:48,027 --> 00:09:49,949
And you guys
are still using parachutes?

155
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:55,995
Jingle-bam!

156
00:10:00,497 --> 00:10:01,790
Wayne!

157
00:10:08,504 --> 00:10:09,547
No!

158
00:10:21,473 --> 00:10:25,436
We're in the belly of the beast,
my friend. One of us might die.

159
00:10:25,769 --> 00:10:27,027
- Probably gonna be you.
-What?

160
00:10:28,146 --> 00:10:30,317
Okay, let's not be dramatic.

161
00:10:31,107 --> 00:10:32,400
Future Elf of the Year here.

162
00:10:33,109 --> 00:10:34,153
Follow my lead.

163
00:10:34,485 --> 00:10:37,202
After all, stealth is my middle name.

164
00:10:37,905 --> 00:10:39,661
I thought it was Francis.

165
00:10:41,658 --> 00:10:42,702
Do you see what I mean?

166
00:10:44,328 --> 00:10:47,045
Noel might have stomped on this,
and woke up the whole house.

167
00:10:47,413 --> 00:10:48,706
No, wait!

168
00:10:51,209 --> 00:10:52,501
Ho, ho, go!

169
00:10:52,668 --> 00:10:55,551
I broke my bat on Johnny's head
Somebody snitched on me

170
00:10:55,629 --> 00:10:58,643
I hid a frog in sister's bed
Somebody snitched on me

171
00:10:58,715 --> 00:11:01,728
I spilled some ink on Mommy's rug
I made Tommy eat a bug

172
00:11:01,801 --> 00:11:04,600
Bought some gum with a penny slug
Somebody snitched on me

173
00:11:04,679 --> 00:11:07,526
We're in the kill zone!
Serpentine! Serpentine!

174
00:11:07,682 --> 00:11:10,730
Mommy and Daddy are mad

175
00:11:11,268 --> 00:11:13,154
Move, everyone. Move! Move!

176
00:11:14,187 --> 00:11:16,607
- Keep going, Tree Skirt.
-Right behind you!

177
00:11:20,526 --> 00:11:22,116
You make me hoppy.

178
00:11:22,319 --> 00:11:24,704
Stand down. Okay, bunny, let's bounce.

179
00:11:26,532 --> 00:11:28,868
Way to block him with your face!
My turn!

180
00:11:31,953 --> 00:11:33,674
I'll just go get the Fruitcake, then?

181
00:11:34,205 --> 00:11:35,462
I told you I got this.

182
00:11:35,998 --> 00:11:38,502
No pre-school toy
picks on my big brother!

183
00:11:38,626 --> 00:11:43,180
I ain't been nothing but bad

184
00:11:57,268 --> 00:11:58,608
This isn't very tinsel!

185
00:12:05,441 --> 00:12:06,782
I killed the naughty kid!

186
00:12:08,736 --> 00:12:09,779
Lanny!

187
00:12:13,281 --> 00:12:14,456
Jinglesmell?

188
00:12:18,202 --> 00:12:20,706
But you're so adorable.

189
00:12:25,167 --> 00:12:27,338
So, your friends?

190
00:12:27,418 --> 00:12:30,931
They're never gonna
get into my fortress, Santa's Helper!

191
00:12:32,215 --> 00:12:33,389
Jinglesmell?

192
00:12:33,466 --> 00:12:36,894
The name's Goodwin. Grace Goodwin.

193
00:12:37,387 --> 00:12:40,315
Now give me the password
so I can access the database.

194
00:12:40,388 --> 00:12:41,433
Pass-what?

195
00:12:41,682 --> 00:12:44,446
The password so I can take myself
off the Naughty List.

196
00:12:45,351 --> 00:12:47,985
- There it is.
-Okay. Wait for my signal.

197
00:12:48,354 --> 00:12:51,817
Why would I help you
get off the Naughty List?

198
00:12:51,982 --> 00:12:53,619
Boy, that was a lot of sparkle.

199
00:12:54,527 --> 00:12:57,455
'Cause it's not fair.
I'm not the naughty one.

200
00:12:58,196 --> 00:12:59,240
He is.

201
00:12:59,531 --> 00:13:00,919
A baby brother?

202
00:13:01,407 --> 00:13:04,456
Ever since he was born,
Gabriel's messed up everything.

203
00:13:05,452 --> 00:13:07,707
Like one time,
I came home from school,

204
00:13:07,788 --> 00:13:09,959
he totally ripped up Miss Whiskers!

205
00:13:10,582 --> 00:13:12,219
She was my favourite!

206
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:16,928
And when we went to the mall
so I could ask Santa for a new one,

207
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:19,934
Gabe just kept crying and crying,
and we had to leave.

208
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:24,565
Twelve months and two days
since he was born,

209
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:26,476
and no one's noticed me since.

210
00:13:27,013 --> 00:13:29,232
I need a better vantage point. Cover me.

211
00:13:29,307 --> 00:13:30,648
Hey, I didn't give the...

212
00:13:31,434 --> 00:13:34,981
So don't you understand?
That's why I need the password.

213
00:13:35,271 --> 00:13:38,070
You know what I need? A pizza!

214
00:13:38,607 --> 00:13:41,704
- I'm starving.
-What is it? What is it?

215
00:13:41,777 --> 00:13:44,991
Maybe you just
need to say the magic word.

216
00:13:45,404 --> 00:13:47,540
- Magic word?
-Magic word, magic word, magic word...

217
00:13:47,615 --> 00:13:50,035
Of course! Naughty kids
never use the magic word.

218
00:13:52,077 --> 00:13:53,287
Yes!

219
00:13:56,582 --> 00:13:58,633
Best you don't watch
what happens next.

220
00:14:02,546 --> 00:14:03,589
I did it!

221
00:14:04,213 --> 00:14:05,803
Jingle bells
This is swell

222
00:14:05,882 --> 00:14:08,895
I'm not getting coal
Oh, what fun it is to be

223
00:14:08,968 --> 00:14:10,225
Off the Naughty List

224
00:14:13,931 --> 00:14:14,974
Kringle bytes!

225
00:14:17,892 --> 00:14:20,691
Hey, Noel! We're getting pizza!

226
00:14:21,311 --> 00:14:22,439
You want in?

227
00:14:22,522 --> 00:14:24,941
- Stop! This is my mission.
-No, no, no!

228
00:14:26,358 --> 00:14:27,402
No!

229
00:14:29,068 --> 00:14:30,908
- Give it!
-Come on! Let it go, kid!

230
00:14:31,029 --> 00:14:32,500
It's mine!

231
00:14:34,032 --> 00:14:36,712
- Noel!
-Don't worry! I'll get it, Wayne!

232
00:14:39,704 --> 00:14:41,459
Merry Christmas!

233
00:14:48,377 --> 00:14:50,465
Jingle-bam-a-lam-a-ding-dong.

234
00:14:50,587 --> 00:14:52,391
- Hey, Magee.
-Noel?

235
00:14:52,548 --> 00:14:54,884
Fruitcake in hand.
Mission accomplished.

236
00:14:54,966 --> 00:14:56,937
You just saved Christmas, my friend!

237
00:14:57,010 --> 00:14:59,560
You know what, you'll probably
get Elf of the Year for this.

238
00:14:59,638 --> 00:15:02,437
Roasting chestnuts!
That nerd Thistleton's calling. T-T-Y-L!

239
00:15:03,474 --> 00:15:04,861
Hey, Wayne! Look, I got it.

240
00:15:05,268 --> 00:15:07,569
And now Magee says
I'm gonna be Elf of the Year!

241
00:15:08,395 --> 00:15:09,439
Elf of the Year?

242
00:15:09,563 --> 00:15:11,402
I didn't even know they had that.

243
00:15:11,941 --> 00:15:12,984
This is great.

244
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:16,117
This is great. Best mission ever.

245
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:19,208
Great news.

246
00:15:19,572 --> 00:15:20,829
Something wrong with you?

247
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:24,081
I got to be honest, I've been
getting kind of a vibe over here.

248
00:15:25,244 --> 00:15:27,331
I'll tell you what's wrong with me!

249
00:15:27,579 --> 00:15:29,714
- You!
-Me? What did I do?

250
00:15:30,039 --> 00:15:33,883
You take everything from me!
And I'm sick of you showing me up!

251
00:15:34,127 --> 00:15:36,214
I'm sensing a lot of
pent up hostility, Wayne.

252
00:15:37,087 --> 00:15:38,677
"Pent up"?

253
00:15:38,755 --> 00:15:41,970
Hey, if this is about Dolores,
I told you, I never saw the mistletoe!

254
00:15:42,091 --> 00:15:46,932
It's about Dolores, it's about the Turbo,
it's about all of it!

255
00:15:47,096 --> 00:15:49,267
But it's been so great
being together on this mission!

256
00:15:49,515 --> 00:15:51,436
This mission is a disaster!

257
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,317
I didn't want you along.
I never wanted you along.

258
00:15:54,394 --> 00:15:56,695
I wish I never had a brother!

259
00:16:00,191 --> 00:16:01,698
I know you didn't mean that!

260
00:16:05,321 --> 00:16:06,958
Tell me you didn't mean it, Wayne.

261
00:16:11,409 --> 00:16:13,130
Tell me you didn't mean it.

262
00:16:15,622 --> 00:16:20,426
You know, ever since I was born,
I looked up to you.

263
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:24,046
You knew how to build a snow fort,
skate backwards,

264
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:27,308
write your name in the snow.

265
00:16:27,382 --> 00:16:29,055
You were my hero.

266
00:16:30,343 --> 00:16:31,387
Hero?

267
00:16:36,056 --> 00:16:37,528
Until now.

268
00:16:38,142 --> 00:16:39,186
Merry Christmas.

269
00:16:44,439 --> 00:16:45,613
The Super Sled.

270
00:16:48,192 --> 00:16:49,236
You found one?

271
00:16:56,783 --> 00:16:59,713
Well, I forgot
how amazing this thing was.

272
00:17:03,664 --> 00:17:09,346
You know, Captain Avalanche,
he's nothing without Snowball.

273
00:17:10,587 --> 00:17:12,971
Never has been, and never will be.

274
00:17:14,423 --> 00:17:15,847
You got that right.

275
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:18,802
I'm sorry, Noel.

276
00:17:20,387 --> 00:17:21,432
Jingle-bam?

277
00:17:22,765 --> 00:17:25,232
- Jingle-bam! Come here!
-Okay!

278
00:17:26,477 --> 00:17:29,360
Hey, is that pizza here, yet?

279
00:17:32,356 --> 00:17:33,448
Hello, beautiful.

280
00:17:33,524 --> 00:17:34,996
Please tell me
you still have that Fruitcake.

281
00:17:35,068 --> 00:17:36,194
Got it right here.

282
00:17:36,526 --> 00:17:37,868
Well, it's causing bigger problems now.

283
00:17:37,945 --> 00:17:40,281
Somehow the database has been fried,
and because of that...

284
00:17:40,363 --> 00:17:44,041
Every child on Earth
is going on the Naughty List!

285
00:17:45,577 --> 00:17:46,703
Frostbite!

286
00:17:48,329 --> 00:17:51,792
As I've said, every child
is being transferred to the Naughty List

287
00:17:51,874 --> 00:17:54,294
and I am unable
to interface with the Fruitcake.

288
00:17:54,793 --> 00:17:56,798
Maybe because the antenna's broken?

289
00:17:57,378 --> 00:17:59,965
Okay, in that case,
you need to re-wire the FCC

290
00:18:00,048 --> 00:18:02,183
and piggyback it
to the most powerful antenna

291
00:18:02,259 --> 00:18:04,559
you can locate to reverse the damage.

292
00:18:05,053 --> 00:18:06,310
This is all my fault.

293
00:18:06,387 --> 00:18:08,522
Where are we gonna find
an antenna that strong?

294
00:18:08,597 --> 00:18:10,852
Hey, what about that one?

295
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:16,740
First you will need to bypass
the internal motherboard.

296
00:18:16,812 --> 00:18:19,529
Did that already.
I'm reassigning the main battery

297
00:18:19,606 --> 00:18:21,113
to power the manual sync.

298
00:18:21,191 --> 00:18:23,908
Yes. Well, I was just going to say that.

299
00:18:24,236 --> 00:18:25,493
Wire cutters, please.

300
00:18:26,112 --> 00:18:27,750
This is a bumpy sleigh ride!

301
00:18:27,906 --> 00:18:29,247
Hey, it's ready.

302
00:18:29,657 --> 00:18:31,211
Thanks, kid. Nice work.

303
00:18:31,493 --> 00:18:32,536
Wayne!

304
00:18:34,578 --> 00:18:36,334
I'm sorry for being so naughty.

305
00:18:36,914 --> 00:18:39,927
Hey, always be your brother's hero.

306
00:18:41,585 --> 00:18:43,340
Hey, wait for me, I'm...

307
00:18:44,754 --> 00:18:46,557
Worldwide Naughty List at 75%.

308
00:18:46,631 --> 00:18:48,267
Make the numbers go down, genius!

309
00:18:48,424 --> 00:18:49,681
The Tree Farm is overloading.

310
00:18:50,009 --> 00:18:52,228
It was never designed
for this much naughtiness.

311
00:18:52,303 --> 00:18:55,850
If levels reach 100%
Christmas will be ruined!

312
00:18:58,391 --> 00:18:59,684
Come on.

313
00:19:04,897 --> 00:19:07,365
This way, follow me.

314
00:19:08,233 --> 00:19:09,574
UP you go!

315
00:19:10,985 --> 00:19:12,907
Man, are you heavy!

316
00:19:14,113 --> 00:19:17,411
Just like the fortress
of Professor Permafrost.

317
00:19:18,034 --> 00:19:19,754
Race you to the top, Snowball.

318
00:19:22,413 --> 00:19:23,456
Come on!

319
00:19:24,998 --> 00:19:26,041
This way!

320
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:27,877
93%.

321
00:19:28,251 --> 00:19:29,638
94%.

322
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:40,099
We can't get through there!

323
00:19:41,137 --> 00:19:42,608
The Super Sled can!

324
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:45,149
With glacier grappling hook
and zip-line action.

325
00:19:46,434 --> 00:19:48,071
Here. You're the better shot.

326
00:19:50,313 --> 00:19:51,902
I can't get a clear view.

327
00:19:53,231 --> 00:19:55,532
Hurry, Wayne. We're at 97.

328
00:19:55,859 --> 00:19:56,902
Ninety-eight!

329
00:19:57,819 --> 00:19:58,863
Holiday hug.

330
00:20:05,201 --> 00:20:06,837
Good thing
you're still using parachutes!

331
00:20:07,286 --> 00:20:08,329
Yeah.

332
00:20:08,453 --> 00:20:09,497
Jingle-bam!

333
00:20:18,796 --> 00:20:23,434
96%. Ninety-four.
Levels returning to normal, baby.

334
00:20:23,508 --> 00:20:25,644
- I mean...
-Come here, nerd!

335
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:28,310
Oh, my!

336
00:20:32,141 --> 00:20:34,561
- We did it!
-Yeah!

337
00:20:41,274 --> 00:20:45,699
A new Miss Whiskers!
Merry Christmas, Gabriel!

338
00:20:46,112 --> 00:20:47,784
Well, look at that.

339
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:52,619
There's no better gift than family,
is there?

340
00:20:53,244 --> 00:20:54,833
Thanks for teaming us up, sir.

341
00:20:55,371 --> 00:20:56,923
Best present I ever got.

342
00:20:57,205 --> 00:20:59,091
Well done, lads.

343
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:04,758
We'd better get a move on.
Don't want to be late, do we?

344
00:21:06,463 --> 00:21:10,224
And congratulations
to Wayne and Noel!

345
00:21:10,926 --> 00:21:12,266
- Jingle-bam!
-Jingle-bam!

346
00:21:13,386 --> 00:21:15,391
- Merry Christmas!
-Way to go, guys!

347
00:21:15,554 --> 00:21:17,108
