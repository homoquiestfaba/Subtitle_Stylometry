sitting on the toilet

You might be
making some tension,

How's it all?

51
00:02:04,859 --> 00:02:07,160
I think pretty good.

52
00:02:07,194 --> 00:02:08,529
Um.

53
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:12,567
I'm hormonal.

(clearing throat)

(chuckling)

57
00:02:17,705 --> 00:02:19,473
Do you have something to say?

58
00:02:19,507 --> 00:02:22,476
We... we had kind of
a Defcon 3 meltdown

59
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:24,344
in Target the other day.

60
00:02:24,378 --> 00:02:26,313
- It was about car seats.
- Yeah.

61
00:02:26,346 --> 00:02:28,348
We read all this stuff online,

62
00:02:28,382 --> 00:02:31,485
all the safety things,
all the recommendations,

63
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:33,521
and...

64
00:02:33,554 --> 00:02:35,757
and I had a friend say,

65
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:39,326
"You know, this one's great
'cause it's the lightest one."

66
00:02:39,359 --> 00:02:41,261
The Chicco that goes...

67
00:02:41,294 --> 00:02:43,865
- Yeah.
- That's, yeah, interchangeable.

68
00:02:43,898 --> 00:02:45,566
- Yeah.
- But, once we get there,

69
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,435
I saw it was also
the cheapest one,

70
00:02:48,468 --> 00:02:52,707
and then that made me
so uncomfortable,

71
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:54,942
'cause then I didn't trust it,
and then I, like...

72
00:02:54,976 --> 00:02:58,445
I felt like a shitty mom
for going to buy

73
00:02:58,478 --> 00:03:02,482
the cheapest car seat
'cause it was the lightest one,

74
00:03:02,517 --> 00:03:03,985
and it was the one
that was recommended to me,

75
00:03:04,018 --> 00:03:06,821
but it wasn't
the highest rated one.

76
00:03:06,854 --> 00:03:08,388
Hm.

77
00:03:08,422 --> 00:03:09,691
(sighing)

78
00:03:09,724 --> 00:03:11,859
I, like, totally lost it.

79
00:03:11,893 --> 00:03:13,861
We didn't wind up
with that car seat.

80
00:03:13,895 --> 00:03:15,763
- Okay.
- Um.

81
00:03:15,797 --> 00:03:17,532
And... and we've never
done this before,

82
00:03:17,565 --> 00:03:20,768
so we don't know what...
what the right thing to do is.

83
00:03:20,802 --> 00:03:22,469
We don't know
what the right way to go is.

84
00:03:22,503 --> 00:03:24,906
But, I mean,
I know that my tendency

85
00:03:24,939 --> 00:03:28,943
is to... you know,
I get anxious about this stuff,

86
00:03:28,976 --> 00:03:30,578
- and...
- Yeah.

87
00:03:30,611 --> 00:03:33,681
And then, I try
to mitigate my anxiousness

88
00:03:33,715 --> 00:03:36,851
- with control, and...
- And when he gets,

89
00:03:36,884 --> 00:03:38,686
like, high tense
and controlling about stuff,

90
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,321
then I start
to just take care of him,

91
00:03:41,354 --> 00:03:43,758
and I totally throw myself
out the window...

92
00:03:43,791 --> 00:03:45,893
Right, she's trying
to take care of me,

93
00:03:45,927 --> 00:03:49,731
and controlling the situation,
which... which pisses me off,

94
00:03:49,764 --> 00:03:52,332
because we just keep
triggering each other, and...

95
00:03:52,365 --> 00:03:53,968
Like, we've always,
you know, kinda sometimes

96
00:03:54,001 --> 00:03:55,803
we just get into
a cycle of, like,

97
00:03:55,837 --> 00:03:58,371
- Caretaking, controlling...
- Caretaking, controlling.

98
00:03:58,405 --> 00:04:00,007
But, I would say it's like

99
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:03,276
- mm, mm, mm, because of that.
- It's on steroids.

100
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:05,312
So, why don't you just
take a deep breath?

101
00:04:05,345 --> 00:04:06,781
Okay.

102
00:04:06,814 --> 00:04:09,984
(breathing deeply)

103
00:04:10,017 --> 00:04:12,520
Now, close your eyes
for a second,

104
00:04:12,553 --> 00:04:15,288
both of you,

105
00:04:15,322 --> 00:04:17,925
and I want you
to think about is,

106
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:20,061
what do you need most
from each other

107
00:04:20,094 --> 00:04:22,964
to get through the rest
of this pregnancy?

108
00:04:22,997 --> 00:04:26,834
And how can you
best show up for each other

109
00:04:26,868 --> 00:04:30,303
and make sure that
those needs get met?

110
00:04:30,337 --> 00:04:32,640
(birds chirping)

111
00:04:45,753 --> 00:04:53,895
(♪♪♪)

112
00:04:53,928 --> 00:04:55,428
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

113
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:57,532
- Bye.
- Bye.

114
00:04:57,565 --> 00:04:59,033
Okay.

115
00:04:59,066 --> 00:05:01,836
(♪♪♪)

116
00:05:01,869 --> 00:05:05,338
Oh, don't forget, oxytocin.

117
00:05:05,372 --> 00:05:08,375
At least one orgasm a day, okay?

118
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:10,645
One orgasm every day.

119
00:05:10,678 --> 00:05:11,879
- Just one.
- For both of us?

120
00:05:11,913 --> 00:05:14,381
- More her, you...
- It's my oxytocin.

121
00:05:14,414 --> 00:05:16,050
- It's hers.
- It's my oxytocin, too.

122
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:17,585
- One.
- Bye.

123
00:05:17,618 --> 00:05:19,419
Bye.

124
00:05:19,452 --> 00:05:22,957

127
00:05:32,066 --> 00:05:34,434
- These kinda go together.
- I like this one.

128
00:05:34,467 --> 00:05:35,770
His and her?

129
00:05:35,803 --> 00:05:37,138
These are for us to wear, right?

130
00:05:37,171 --> 00:05:38,806
Yeah.

131
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,708

(♪♪♪)

133
00:05:48,082 --> 00:05:49,750
You don't have to watch us open,

134
00:05:49,784 --> 00:05:52,854
especially if you got us
a shitty gift,

135
00:05:52,887 --> 00:05:54,789
but if you want to,

136
00:05:54,822 --> 00:05:57,058
we're gonna be determining
which ones of you

137
00:05:57,091 --> 00:05:59,560
are our close friends,
and which ones of you

138
00:05:59,594 --> 00:06:01,596
are expendable, so.

139
00:06:01,629 --> 00:06:03,731
- Ohh.
- Ohh.

140
00:06:03,764 --> 00:06:08,703

141
00:06:08,736 --> 00:06:10,638
- Oh, my God, it's the Chicco!
- Oh, man.

142
00:06:10,671 --> 00:06:13,808
- That's cool.
- Oh, my God, it's a car seat.

143
00:06:13,841 --> 00:06:16,077
It's a good one, it's light,
it's not too heavy,

144
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:17,912
so you can pop it out,
and I'll teach you

145
00:06:17,945 --> 00:06:20,014
a little trick for how to,
like, loop your arm under,

146
00:06:20,047 --> 00:06:22,482
- and it makes it easier to...
- It's a huge gift.

147
00:06:22,516 --> 00:06:25,086
- Kids do well with it, and...
- So, yeah, and the breastfeed,

148
00:06:25,119 --> 00:06:28,556
it, like, really hurts
for a long time.

149
00:06:28,589 --> 00:06:31,092
Oh, my gosh, she talked about
the latch-on like it was so hard

150
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:32,593
for new Rudi be able
to latch on,

151
00:06:32,627 --> 00:06:34,061
and she just, like,
"Near, near near,"

152
00:06:34,095 --> 00:06:36,429
like a little gremlin,
just biting and trying to,

153
00:06:36,463 --> 00:06:40,433
like, suck you dry
of every little ounce of life

154
00:06:40,467 --> 00:06:42,069
- in your soul.
- The only part of it

155
00:06:42,103 --> 00:06:44,005
that is cute is, like,
your friend who, like,

156
00:06:44,038 --> 00:06:47,440
posts a beautiful photo of her
breastfeeding on social media.

157
00:06:47,474 --> 00:06:49,110
(overlapping remarks)

158
00:06:49,143 --> 00:06:51,045
It's like, "Uh-huh, okay."

159
00:06:51,078 --> 00:06:52,947
- Nature at its best.
- I've got, like, the cracked,

160
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:54,682
bleeding nipples,
and you're just like,

161
00:06:54,715 --> 00:06:56,117
"Fuck you."

162
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:58,185
It's cute, it's cute.

163
00:06:58,219 --> 00:07:00,453
Well, that's the thing,
and I feel like women,

164
00:07:00,487 --> 00:07:02,890
and correct me if I'm...
if I'm speaking out of turn,

165
00:07:02,924 --> 00:07:06,560
but I feel like women
do other women a real disservice

166
00:07:06,594 --> 00:07:08,495
when they talk about
their birth experience,

167
00:07:08,529 --> 00:07:10,564
like, "Oh, my God,
it was so wonderful."

168
00:07:10,598 --> 00:07:13,668
I think that that's
a really messed up thing to do

169
00:07:13,701 --> 00:07:15,636
to somebody who's about to
go into childbirth,

170
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:18,606
'cause you should prepared
that it's gonna be

171
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:21,742
the worst thing ever.

172
00:07:21,776 --> 00:07:26,247
It is, sometimes it just tears
all the way down.

173
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,082
But, that's just the beginning,

174
00:07:28,115 --> 00:07:30,651
and that's gonna be, like,
one to two days tops of...

175
00:07:30,685 --> 00:07:33,888
of your life,
and then it really... begins

176
00:07:33,921 --> 00:07:36,524
- to like...
- Do you guys have a method

177
00:07:36,557 --> 00:07:39,160
- that, like, you're in?
- Your, um, parenting method.

178
00:07:39,193 --> 00:07:42,697
So, we've been doing, um...
been doing these RIE classes.

179
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:45,099
- Uh-oh.
- Which are pretty cool.

180
00:07:45,132 --> 00:07:47,001
- Yeah.
- Read the Janet Lansbury books,

181
00:07:47,034 --> 00:07:49,170
- which are fantastic.
- And Babywise.

182
00:07:49,203 --> 00:07:50,738
- Babywise.
- To get around

183
00:07:50,771 --> 00:07:52,773
our sleep schedules,
so like, we know when

184
00:07:52,807 --> 00:07:54,809
her cry phase will be, and...

185
00:07:54,842 --> 00:07:57,011
I think picking and choosing

186
00:07:57,044 --> 00:07:59,046
different pieces
from different books

187
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:01,649
is totally fine, that's great.

188
00:08:01,682 --> 00:08:02,850
But, you have to decide, like,

189
00:08:02,883 --> 00:08:04,151
"Are we gonna have
a family bed?"

190
00:08:04,185 --> 00:08:06,153
Like, is she gonna
sleep with you guys.

191
00:08:06,187 --> 00:08:07,888
- That's what we did.
- We did not do that.

192
00:08:07,922 --> 00:08:10,791
We had her sleeping with us
until she was, like, 5?

193
00:08:10,825 --> 00:08:12,693
- Yeah, about 5 years old.
- Were you guys just

194
00:08:12,727 --> 00:08:14,095
afraid of, like, crib death,
is that why you...?

195
00:08:14,128 --> 00:08:15,663
- Yeah, that was...
- Well, that was one of

196
00:08:15,696 --> 00:08:17,565
the big things, of course,
it's crib death.

197
00:08:17,598 --> 00:08:19,100
We wanted to
keep her close to us.

198
00:08:19,133 --> 00:08:21,602
But, I mean, she is a girl,
so I mean,

199
00:08:21,635 --> 00:08:24,138
it's not that high crib deaths
for... for girls baby...

200
00:08:24,171 --> 00:08:26,741
You keep saying "crib death"
like that's a thing to...

201
00:08:26,774 --> 00:08:28,209
- It's... it's a thing.
- Well, yeah, it is.

202
00:08:28,242 --> 00:08:30,244
(overlapping remarks)

203
00:08:30,277 --> 00:08:32,613
It's... for a while it's hell,
so just be prepared

204
00:08:32,646 --> 00:08:34,248
- that it's gonna be...
- You don't get a lot of sleep

205
00:08:34,281 --> 00:08:36,050
- at all.
- As soon as they're born,

206
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:38,052
you will no longer do anything
that you enjoy, because...

207
00:08:38,085 --> 00:08:40,154
Your baby dictates
who you will become.

208
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:42,256
You don't get to
be yourselves anymore,

209
00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:44,759
'cause you're so tired,
and so focused

210
00:08:44,792 --> 00:08:47,695
on making sure that you're not
ruining this kid's life,

211
00:08:47,728 --> 00:08:49,330
and you're trying to make sure
that you're doing it

212
00:08:49,363 --> 00:08:51,132
in a healthy way,
in a productive way,

213
00:08:51,165 --> 00:08:52,666
in a happy way.

214
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,068
You're not gonna repeat
your parents' mistakes,

215
00:08:54,101 --> 00:08:55,669
you're not gonna
do the wrong things,

216
00:08:55,703 --> 00:08:57,304
- and you do.
- Yep.

217
00:08:57,338 --> 00:09:00,141
- You just do.
- Watching my parents

218
00:09:00,174 --> 00:09:02,143
deteriorate in front
of my eyes as a child,

219
00:09:02,176 --> 00:09:04,945
and not really understand
what it was,

220
00:09:04,979 --> 00:09:07,014
I feel like you can
see them shrinking from

221
00:09:07,048 --> 00:09:08,816
- who they wanted to be.
- You're basically

222
00:09:08,849 --> 00:09:10,351
- getting thrown into war.
- You don't have time

223
00:09:10,384 --> 00:09:11,886
for yourself, you just don't,
like...

224
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:13,754
My mother didn't wanna
become her mother.

225
00:09:13,788 --> 00:09:15,322
Her mother didn't wanna
become her mother.

226
00:09:15,356 --> 00:09:18,759
- My sister didn't wanna become...
- And you see it, you know it,

227
00:09:18,793 --> 00:09:20,194
you hate it,

228
00:09:20,227 --> 00:09:22,329
- but you can't stop...
- My dad had his money in order,

229
00:09:22,363 --> 00:09:24,065
had, you know,
a record collection,

230
00:09:24,098 --> 00:09:25,332
all this cool stuff.

231
00:09:25,366 --> 00:09:27,068
He had a car
that he really liked,

232
00:09:27,101 --> 00:09:29,603
he cared about his fucking car,
and then at a certain point,

233
00:09:29,637 --> 00:09:31,238
everything was annihilated.

234
00:09:31,272 --> 00:09:33,340
I saw that happen, I saw a man

235
00:09:33,374 --> 00:09:36,377
deteriorate in front of my eyes
as a teenager.

236
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:38,012
I... it was a nightmare.

237
00:09:38,045 --> 00:09:40,014
I can't... I couldn't do it.

238
00:09:40,047 --> 00:09:41,849
(♪♪♪)

239
00:09:41,882 --> 00:09:43,217
But, you guys
are gonna kill it, I...

240
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:46,921
(chuckling)

241
00:09:46,954 --> 00:09:48,289
Yeah.

242
00:09:48,322 --> 00:09:51,025
Babe, babe, can you...

243
00:09:51,058 --> 00:09:52,960
can you please tell me what's...?

244
00:09:52,993 --> 00:09:55,196
Jackie.

245
00:09:55,229 --> 00:09:57,832
Can you... can you just stop
for a second?

246
00:09:57,865 --> 00:09:59,834
(whirring)

247
00:09:59,867 --> 00:10:01,669
Babe,

248
00:10:01,702 --> 00:10:04,638
can you look at me
and talk to me, please?

249
00:10:04,672 --> 00:10:08,008
(whirring)

250
00:10:08,042 --> 00:10:10,811
Babe.

251
00:10:16,283 --> 00:10:18,185
What the fuck is this?

252
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:21,222
Hummus.

253
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:29,930
Did you not see this one?

254
00:10:29,964 --> 00:10:31,799
- I...
- I got this one two days ago.

255
00:10:31,832 --> 00:10:33,200
- I didn't... I didn't see that.
- It's huge.

256
00:10:33,234 --> 00:10:35,102
Okay, I didn't see that,
but I don't think

257
00:10:35,136 --> 00:10:38,072
- it's a big deal, can we not...?
- Now, we're just never gonna

258
00:10:38,105 --> 00:10:40,007
get through both of these
before they go bad.

259
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:42,443
- Oh, okay, but...
- This one's huge.

260
00:10:42,476 --> 00:10:44,145
I... I didn't see it,
I didn't look.

261
00:10:44,178 --> 00:10:46,280
I was also... you gave me
the list with the bok choy

262
00:10:46,313 --> 00:10:47,815
- and the tamarind.
- Yeah, I gave you a list.

263
00:10:47,848 --> 00:10:49,717
I was just trying
to do a nice thing.

264
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,952
I'm just asking you
to do an aware thing.

265
00:10:51,986 --> 00:10:54,722
Look, we've...
we've already eaten some.

266
00:10:54,755 --> 00:10:56,690
Look, there's already
that much out...

267
00:10:56,724 --> 00:10:59,260
You're making that up,
you're, like, making that up

268
00:10:59,293 --> 00:11:00,761
- to make your argument stronger.
- Okay.

269
00:11:00,794 --> 00:11:03,164
The seal is still on it.

270
00:11:03,197 --> 00:11:05,366
Okay, okay,
so the seal's still on it,

271
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:07,434
- but... but the way they pack...
- Why would you lie to me

272
00:11:07,468 --> 00:11:08,869
and be like,
"We already ate some"?

273
00:11:08,903 --> 00:11:10,371
I mean, look,
it's not that full.

274
00:11:10,404 --> 00:11:11,839
- It's like a potato chip...
- You actually think we're gonna

275
00:11:11,872 --> 00:11:14,175
eat all of this
before this one...

276
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:15,943
- Yes!
- ...goes bad?

277
00:11:15,976 --> 00:11:18,913
- We eat a lot of hummus.
- We would never eat this much.

278
00:11:18,946 --> 00:11:20,314
- We've definitely eaten...
- When?

279
00:11:20,347 --> 00:11:22,149
- When? When?
- two things of hummus in a week.

280
00:11:22,183 --> 00:11:24,818
Okay, this is not... do you hear
yourself talking right now?

281
00:11:24,852 --> 00:11:27,154
Do you hear yourself talking?
You're, like, making shit up

282
00:11:27,188 --> 00:11:29,857
- about the stuff we do!
- Would you fucking stop?

283
00:11:32,126 --> 00:11:33,961
I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to yell.

284
00:11:33,994 --> 00:11:35,329
Would you just stop?

285
00:11:35,362 --> 00:11:37,031
Because you're getting
really stressed out,

286
00:11:37,064 --> 00:11:39,266
and the OB said
you can't get stressed out.

287
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:42,369
Babe, please don't cry.

288
00:11:42,403 --> 00:11:44,238
I'm... I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

289
00:11:44,271 --> 00:11:46,073
Look, this was all my fault.

290
00:11:46,106 --> 00:11:47,908
I should've absolutely seen

291
00:11:47,942 --> 00:11:49,511
that you bought hummus
two days ago.

292
00:11:49,544 --> 00:11:52,012
I was trying to do a nice thing,
but you're right, it was stupid.

293
00:11:52,046 --> 00:11:53,781
It wasn't a nice thing.

294
00:11:53,814 --> 00:11:55,382
It was a stupid
and oblivious thing,

295
00:11:55,416 --> 00:11:58,819
and, hey, stop, stop,
please, please, please?

296
00:11:58,852 --> 00:12:01,021
Babe,

297
00:12:01,055 --> 00:12:03,023
I'm really sorry.

298
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,361
Hey.

299
00:12:09,196 --> 00:12:11,198
(tearing)

300
00:12:13,367 --> 00:12:14,935
Ew.

301
00:12:14,969 --> 00:12:18,372
Why did you just
put your hand in it?

302
00:12:18,405 --> 00:12:21,543
If having too much hummus
is an issue,

303
00:12:21,576 --> 00:12:25,379
then I'm gonna
take care of the issue.

304
00:12:25,412 --> 00:12:27,381
Whether it makes sense
to me or not.

305
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:30,184
It looks...
you're not enjoying it.

306
00:12:30,217 --> 00:12:33,954
This is the best hummus
I've ever had.

307
00:12:33,988 --> 00:12:35,389
(laughing)

308
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:37,091
I love this hummus so much.

309
00:12:37,124 --> 00:12:38,560
Oh, my gosh, I mean...

310
00:12:38,593 --> 00:12:40,928
- Ugh, the smell.
- This is fun.

311
00:12:40,961 --> 00:12:42,196
The smell, please stop.

312
00:12:42,229 --> 00:12:43,931
Please stop putting it
in your mouth,

313
00:12:43,964 --> 00:12:45,399
- stop putting it in your mouth.
- And I'm gonna eat that one

314
00:12:45,432 --> 00:12:47,468
- after I'm done with this.
- No.

315
00:12:47,502 --> 00:12:48,936
- No.
- And we're not gonna

316
00:12:48,969 --> 00:12:50,471
have enough, are we?
And we're gonna have to

317
00:12:50,505 --> 00:12:52,339
go shopping for more hummus
later on this afternoon.

318
00:12:52,373 --> 00:12:54,542
- Don't you fucking dare.
- 'Cause I'm gonna be

319
00:12:54,576 --> 00:12:56,844
a hummus-eating machine.

320
00:12:56,877 --> 00:12:58,379
Don't put it in your mouth,
it's so...

321
00:12:58,412 --> 00:13:00,247
Ugh!

322
00:13:01,616 --> 00:13:03,917
Oh, God, sorry, that's so gross.

323
00:13:03,951 --> 00:13:06,253
- I just wanna establish that...
- Oh, God.

324
00:13:07,988 --> 00:13:11,526
In this case, your concern

325
00:13:11,559 --> 00:13:14,962
about our... our hummus overage,

326
00:13:14,995 --> 00:13:17,131
um,
might've just been rectified,

327
00:13:17,164 --> 00:13:18,999
'cause look, look,
that one's half gone.

328
00:13:19,033 --> 00:13:21,001
- It's half gone.
- And here's a vow

329
00:13:21,035 --> 00:13:23,871
that I make to you:

330
00:13:23,904 --> 00:13:28,008
I will never, ever, ever

331
00:13:28,042 --> 00:13:29,943
buy too much hummus again.

332
00:13:29,977 --> 00:13:31,912
- Never.
- Never.

333
00:13:31,945 --> 00:13:34,616
I really appreciate that.

334
00:13:34,649 --> 00:13:36,950
(♪♪♪)

335
00:13:36,984 --> 00:13:39,019
(sniffling)

336
00:13:39,053 --> 00:13:41,455
There are gonna be times when
I probably want more hummus.

337
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:44,124
If you ask me to buy you hummus,
I'll go out and buy you hummus

338
00:13:44,158 --> 00:13:46,293
that minute.

339
00:13:46,327 --> 00:13:47,895
(sniffling)

340
00:13:47,928 --> 00:13:49,564
Hm?

341
00:13:49,597 --> 00:13:54,401
(♪♪♪)

342
00:13:54,435 --> 00:13:56,236
(chuckling)

343
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:57,871
- Oh, God.
- Mm.

344
00:13:57,905 --> 00:13:59,239
- It's smelling.
- Mm.

345
00:13:59,273 --> 00:14:00,974
- It's smelling.
- Mm.

346
00:14:01,008 --> 00:14:02,644
- Mm.
- Mm.

347
00:14:02,677 --> 00:14:04,945
(chuckling)

348
00:14:04,978 --> 00:14:07,214
What are you doing?

349
00:14:07,247 --> 00:14:09,850
Maya said, "Once a day."

350
00:14:11,452 --> 00:14:13,053
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

351
00:14:13,087 --> 00:14:14,288
- What?
- Do you still have

352
00:14:14,321 --> 00:14:16,056
hummus in your mouth?

353
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:17,891
- No, I swallowed the hummus.
- I think there's probably

354
00:14:17,925 --> 00:14:20,160
- still some there.
- No, I think I...

355
00:14:20,194 --> 00:14:21,962
- Yeah, but...
- I think I swallowed it.

356
00:14:21,995 --> 00:14:24,566
I can smell it still, so.

357
00:14:24,599 --> 00:14:26,300
What if you...?
No, it's so...

358
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:28,603
I'm super turned on,
but if you, like,

359
00:14:28,636 --> 00:14:31,506
maybe just
brush your teeth, or...?

360
00:14:31,539 --> 00:14:33,140
- 'Cause of bacteria.
- Okay.

361
00:14:33,173 --> 00:14:35,075
I could go for it, but it...
it's the bacteria

362
00:14:35,109 --> 00:14:37,044
- and the baby.
- Okay, yeah.

363
00:14:37,077 --> 00:14:38,613
I'll go brush my teeth.

364
00:14:38,646 --> 00:14:41,516
And then, I'm gonna be...

365
00:14:41,549 --> 00:14:44,084
I'll meet you upstairs.

366
00:14:44,118 --> 00:14:45,653
Thank you.

367
00:14:45,687 --> 00:14:55,597
(♪♪♪)

368
00:14:57,331 --> 00:15:00,334
You're right,
it was the whole day.

369
00:15:00,367 --> 00:15:02,202
It was the whole day.

370
00:15:02,236 --> 00:15:04,606
- I know.
- Our friends...

371
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:07,174
- suck.
- I know, our friends suck.

372
00:15:07,207 --> 00:15:09,644
They were so discouraging.

373
00:15:12,246 --> 00:15:14,214
It's still a little...
I still smell it.

374
00:15:14,248 --> 00:15:17,017
- You're such a dick.
- I'm a super smeller.

375
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:18,452
(streaming)

376
00:15:18,485 --> 00:15:20,454
Who brings up crib death

377
00:15:20,487 --> 00:15:22,222
at our baby shower?

378
00:15:22,256 --> 00:15:24,191
Mhm, I know.

379
00:15:24,224 --> 00:15:27,194
- Who does that?
- I know.

380
00:15:27,227 --> 00:15:30,030
They said my vagina

381
00:15:30,063 --> 00:15:33,467
is gonna rip down.

382
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,603
To your asshole.

383
00:15:35,637 --> 00:15:37,304
I don't mean to laugh,
because I know

384
00:15:37,337 --> 00:15:39,206
- that would really suck.
- Apparently it happens

385
00:15:39,239 --> 00:15:41,108
- all the time.
- I am just laughing

386
00:15:41,141 --> 00:15:44,111
at the severe insensitivity
of our asshole friends

387
00:15:44,144 --> 00:15:45,979
that they would bring it up
at our fucking baby shower.

388
00:15:46,013 --> 00:15:49,283
I truly don't think
they want us to be parents.

389
00:15:49,316 --> 00:15:52,119
What, you think they want us
to have an abortion?

390
00:15:52,152 --> 00:15:54,221
Third-term abortion.

391
00:15:54,254 --> 00:15:55,623
I do.

392
00:15:55,657 --> 00:15:57,057
- Oh, that's so dark.
- I do, I think they were trying

393
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:58,358
- to convince us...
- That's so dark

394
00:15:58,392 --> 00:16:00,294
to go into the OB, be like,

395
00:16:00,327 --> 00:16:03,197
"Um, here's the thing:
we know we were

396
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:05,767
- really excited...
- "We were, we were excited."

397
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:08,001
...about having this kid, but..."

398
00:16:08,035 --> 00:16:10,270
"But, we had a...
we had a baby shower."

399
00:16:10,304 --> 00:16:12,740
"And our friends
really fucked us up,

400
00:16:12,774 --> 00:16:15,710
and now we're wondering
if you could

401
00:16:15,743 --> 00:16:18,513
take her out, and just, like,

402
00:16:18,546 --> 00:16:20,113
- get rid of her."
- You need to kiss her

403
00:16:20,147 --> 00:16:22,684
after this joke,
this joke is too bad.

404
00:16:22,717 --> 00:16:25,052
- Baby, it's really dark and...
- Baby.

405
00:16:25,085 --> 00:16:28,422
Dark, bad jokes
for a dark, bad baby shower.

406
00:16:28,455 --> 00:16:30,390
(kissing)

407
00:16:30,424 --> 00:16:32,059
But, they were so serious

408
00:16:32,092 --> 00:16:36,029
about... turning out
like their parents.

409
00:16:36,063 --> 00:16:38,098
I know, but you know what?

410
00:16:38,131 --> 00:16:39,534
And it's true.

411
00:16:39,567 --> 00:16:41,803
- But, you know what?
- They have.

412
00:16:41,836 --> 00:16:45,339
But, in fairness, B's always
been a living nightmare, and...

413
00:16:45,372 --> 00:16:47,407
But now,
she's exactly like her mom.

414
00:16:47,441 --> 00:16:50,477
Hey, babe, it's okay.

415
00:16:50,512 --> 00:16:53,080
- You know why?
- Why?

416
00:16:53,113 --> 00:16:55,783
'Cause we're cooler
than they are.

417
00:16:55,817 --> 00:16:58,085
(♪♪♪)

418
00:16:58,118 --> 00:17:00,755
Come on, take your pants off,
come to bed.

419
00:17:00,788 --> 00:17:02,557
(♪♪♪)

420
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:05,425
Fuck.

421
00:17:05,459 --> 00:17:07,227
Honey,

422
00:17:07,261 --> 00:17:09,764
I have to tell you something
before I take my pants off.

423
00:17:09,797 --> 00:17:12,099
No, take your pants off,
then you can tell me something.

424
00:17:12,132 --> 00:17:14,301
- That's so bad.
- No, can you just

425
00:17:14,334 --> 00:17:16,571
take your pants off first,
and then you can

426
00:17:16,604 --> 00:17:18,405
tell me something
if you have to?

427
00:17:18,438 --> 00:17:20,642
(♪♪♪)

428
00:17:20,675 --> 00:17:23,443
Take your pants off.

429
00:17:23,477 --> 00:17:26,413
I got a text from my dad
at the baby shower.

430
00:17:28,683 --> 00:17:30,217
(sighing)

431
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:32,419
I'm so sorry.

432
00:17:32,452 --> 00:17:34,321
Ugh.

433
00:17:34,354 --> 00:17:35,823
- No.
- He said he was gonna

434
00:17:35,857 --> 00:17:37,457
be evicted.

435
00:17:37,491 --> 00:17:40,127
No.

436
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,596
Um, I know.

437
00:17:43,698 --> 00:17:46,534
- I know, honey, I know...
- How much did you send him?

438
00:17:49,202 --> 00:17:50,772
2,000.

439
00:17:52,507 --> 00:17:54,842
I'm... I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

440
00:17:54,876 --> 00:17:57,144
(breathing deeply)

441
00:17:57,177 --> 00:17:59,446
(grunting)

442
00:17:59,479 --> 00:18:00,882
Woo.

443
00:18:00,915 --> 00:18:04,384
Babe, your dad is always
about to be evicted,

444
00:18:04,418 --> 00:18:06,688
because your dad
is a fucking drug addict

445
00:18:06,721 --> 00:18:08,856
who spends
all his money on oxys.

446
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:10,525
You swore.

447
00:18:10,558 --> 00:18:12,326
- You swore to God...
- I know, I did.

448
00:18:12,359 --> 00:18:14,461
...the last four times,
not just, like,

449
00:18:14,494 --> 00:18:15,830
the last time it happened.

450
00:18:15,863 --> 00:18:18,600
The last four times it happened
you swore to me

451
00:18:18,633 --> 00:18:19,867
- that you'd never do it again.
- I did.

452
00:18:19,901 --> 00:18:21,603
- You swore to your sponsor.
- I did.

453
00:18:21,636 --> 00:18:23,638
You swore to our therapist.

454
00:18:23,671 --> 00:18:25,205
- I did.
- We sat down

455
00:18:25,238 --> 00:18:26,874
and we had this discussion,
and you said,

456
00:18:26,908 --> 00:18:28,643
- "I'm never gonna do it again."
- I know.

457
00:18:28,676 --> 00:18:31,546
That's the fucking kid's money
that you just gave him.

458
00:18:31,579 --> 00:18:33,548
You are so, so right,

459
00:18:33,581 --> 00:18:36,383
and I know you're so, so right.

460
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:38,352
Can you... can you not
turn this into, like,

461
00:18:38,385 --> 00:18:41,388
"You're so right,"
self-flagellation stuff?

462
00:18:41,421 --> 00:18:44,759
Can you just let me be
really pissed for a second?

463
00:18:44,792 --> 00:18:47,294
Yes.

464
00:18:47,327 --> 00:18:49,931
Thank you.

465
00:18:49,964 --> 00:18:53,233
Okay, that's all I needed.

466
00:18:53,266 --> 00:18:55,235
(sighing)

467
00:18:55,268 --> 00:18:57,337
- Oh, man.
- It's not fair.

468
00:18:57,371 --> 00:19:00,240
- That's a bummer.
- It's such a bummer.

469
00:19:00,273 --> 00:19:02,744
It was just habit,
but I know I...

470
00:19:02,777 --> 00:19:05,345
I can't, I gotta change.

471
00:19:05,379 --> 00:19:08,716
Well, we both have...
look, I just...

472
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:11,485
I just... my first reaction
when I was upset

473
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:13,487
- was to, like, do that.
- It's very scary.

474
00:19:13,521 --> 00:19:15,455
And... and I don't...

475
00:19:15,489 --> 00:19:18,926
I mean, how many
fucking hundreds of hours

476
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,561
in therapy have I spent

477
00:19:20,595 --> 00:19:22,396
trying to work through
my rage issues.

478
00:19:22,429 --> 00:19:24,599
- There's still...
- A hole.

479
00:19:24,632 --> 00:19:26,834
The hole in the sheetrock

480
00:19:26,868 --> 00:19:29,904
from... from, like,
a month and a half ago,

481
00:19:29,937 --> 00:19:31,506
and that's insane.

482
00:19:31,539 --> 00:19:34,207
It's like,

483
00:19:34,241 --> 00:19:37,477
if we don't
pull our shit together,

484
00:19:37,512 --> 00:19:39,714
- she's gonna...
- We're gonna fuck up our kid.

485
00:19:41,916 --> 00:19:43,483
Mm.

486
00:19:43,518 --> 00:19:45,653
Like, we signed up
for each other's madness.

487
00:19:45,687 --> 00:19:48,656
- I know.
- She didn't sign up for it.

488
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:51,391
I know, it makes me
really sad actually.

489
00:19:51,425 --> 00:19:54,862
The therapy has made us aware.

490
00:19:54,896 --> 00:19:57,364
- Mhm.
- But, clearly...

491
00:19:57,397 --> 00:19:59,466
Hasn't actually changed

492
00:19:59,499 --> 00:20:02,335
our behavior enough.

493
00:20:02,369 --> 00:20:05,640
It's like we need to,
like, shake ourselves,

494
00:20:05,673 --> 00:20:08,710
'cause we gotta pull it together
before we're parents.

495
00:20:08,743 --> 00:20:11,846
And I'm scared, too,
because we've got

496
00:20:11,879 --> 00:20:14,782
- a month.
- What if we shake it up?

497
00:20:14,816 --> 00:20:16,617
What if we challenge each other?

498
00:20:16,651 --> 00:20:18,553
What if we challenge
each other to, like,

499
00:20:18,586 --> 00:20:20,655
activities and tasks?
Like, we have a month...

500
00:20:20,688 --> 00:20:22,857
- I like this.
- ...before this baby is coming.

501
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:24,458
- That is time.
- We got...

502
00:20:24,491 --> 00:20:25,760
- We got four weeks...
- It's a short amount.

503
00:20:25,793 --> 00:20:29,429
to become fully realized humans.

504
00:20:29,463 --> 00:20:33,300
(vocalizing)

505
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:36,537
To be parents.

506
00:20:36,571 --> 00:20:38,740
- Okay, so we got four weeks.
- Let's do something.

507
00:20:38,773 --> 00:20:40,407
- Let's do it, let's do it.
- Let's do it, let's change.

508
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,809
Let's do it.

509
00:20:41,843 --> 00:20:43,745
- What are we gonna do?
- More... let's, like...

510
00:20:43,778 --> 00:20:45,345
Let's jump out of an airplane.

511
00:20:45,378 --> 00:20:47,582
- Dine and dash.
- Dine and dash, I'm in.

512
00:20:47,615 --> 00:20:49,349
- I'm in, let's do it.
- I mean, just to get ourselves,

513
00:20:49,382 --> 00:20:51,284
- like, uncomfortable...
- Okay.

514
00:20:51,318 --> 00:20:53,721
...and, like...
and see what we're made of.

515
00:20:53,755 --> 00:20:55,623
We could, uh...

516
00:20:55,656 --> 00:20:58,860
we could buy a classic car
and drive it up the coast.

517
00:20:58,893 --> 00:21:00,762
Like, we go to Antarctica.

518
00:21:00,795 --> 00:21:03,598
Great, we dive under an icecap,

519
00:21:03,631 --> 00:21:06,333
and swim around,
and we come up, and woo!

520
00:21:06,366 --> 00:21:08,703
- Yeah, yeah!
- Yeah, yeah!

521
00:21:08,736 --> 00:21:10,738
We could jump off a cliff
into the ocean.

522
00:21:10,772 --> 00:21:13,841
- Um, we could swim with sharks.
- We could graffiti something.

523
00:21:13,875 --> 00:21:15,510
Uh, we could get tattoos.

524
00:21:15,543 --> 00:21:17,779
- Let's, um...
- Go to a punk-rock show.

525
00:21:17,812 --> 00:21:20,380
- Mosh pit.
- We buy a falcon.

526
00:21:20,413 --> 00:21:22,683
- I would love a falcon.
- Oh, yeah.

527
00:21:22,717 --> 00:21:24,852
- Sitting on the porch.
- Um.

528
00:21:24,886 --> 00:21:27,320
We could...
let's get chased by the cops.

529
00:21:27,354 --> 00:21:28,890
We could do anything honestly.

530
00:21:28,923 --> 00:21:30,625
We could... but we could both take

531
00:21:30,658 --> 00:21:32,425
- pole dancing classes.
- I could fuck you in the ass.

532
00:21:32,459 --> 00:21:34,028
(chuckling)

533
00:21:34,061 --> 00:21:35,863
That's funny.

534
00:21:35,897 --> 00:21:38,699
(laughing)

535
00:21:38,733 --> 00:21:40,701
- Yeah, no.
- Okay, what else could we do?

536
00:21:40,735 --> 00:21:42,402
- No, but, honey.
- What?

537
00:21:42,435 --> 00:21:44,471
- Actually that one...
- Oh, we're not playing a game,

538
00:21:44,505 --> 00:21:46,373
- you're serious now.
- All the other ones

539
00:21:46,406 --> 00:21:48,075
it's super fun to think of,
but we actually

540
00:21:48,109 --> 00:21:50,578
can't travel right now,
'cause of the baby,

541
00:21:50,611 --> 00:21:52,880
and we can't put her
in dangerous situations.

542
00:21:52,914 --> 00:21:55,448
Like... like, it's fun to think
about jumping out of a plane,

543
00:21:55,482 --> 00:21:56,818
but I'm never gonna
do that with a baby,

544
00:21:56,851 --> 00:21:59,654
but... but what about

545
00:21:59,687 --> 00:22:02,089
pegging?

546
00:22:02,123 --> 00:22:04,692
- Because that's...
- I... I... I...

547
00:22:04,725 --> 00:22:06,127
- ...intimate.
- I just got...

548
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:08,495
It is intimate,
I don't see how it really

549
00:22:08,529 --> 00:22:10,631
prepares us
to become better parents

550
00:22:10,665 --> 00:22:12,033
- in a month.
- No, but it... it makes us

551
00:22:12,066 --> 00:22:13,534
- deal with stuff.
- Ugh.

552
00:22:13,568 --> 00:22:16,537
It's an act... it's so actionable.

553
00:22:16,571 --> 00:22:18,639
Yeah, no,
it's definitely actionable.

554
00:22:18,673 --> 00:22:20,440
I read this article
and it's like it's supposed

555
00:22:20,473 --> 00:22:22,510
- to be so empowering.
- Mhm.

556
00:22:22,543 --> 00:22:25,546
And it... and honestly,
it really deals with our issues

557
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:26,948
in a way where...
'cause I'm always being

558
00:22:26,981 --> 00:22:28,783
a caretaker,
and I'm always, like...

559
00:22:28,816 --> 00:22:31,484
Like, when we have sex,
I receive you and I hold you,

560
00:22:31,519 --> 00:22:32,820
and I'm always going

561
00:22:32,854 --> 00:22:34,555
- with your rhythm.
- I wait until you come

562
00:22:34,589 --> 00:22:36,057
- until I come every single time.
- Which is... which is awesome.

563
00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:37,792
No, you are
a very generous lover,

564
00:22:37,825 --> 00:22:39,694
you're very good, but it is
like a waiting for you...

565
00:22:39,727 --> 00:22:41,762
it is... there is, like, um...

566
00:22:41,796 --> 00:22:43,831
you're in control,

567
00:22:43,865 --> 00:22:46,167
and what if
you weren't in control?

568
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:49,136
Hm?

569
00:22:49,170 --> 00:22:52,607
I mean, it would be so...
remember what Maya said?

570
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,475
Yeah, when... when we were
humming the song back then,

571
00:22:55,509 --> 00:22:58,478
I didn't think it was leading
to fucking me in the ass.

572
00:22:58,512 --> 00:23:00,615
(sighing)

573
00:23:00,648 --> 00:23:02,516
- Honey.
- Uh-huh?

574
00:23:05,485 --> 00:23:08,556
I feel like I need this.

575
00:23:08,589 --> 00:23:18,498
(♪♪♪)

576
00:23:24,605 --> 00:23:26,507
(beeping)

577
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:30,477
(♪♪♪)

578
00:23:30,511 --> 00:23:32,013
- Hello.
- Hi.

579
00:23:32,046 --> 00:23:34,649
Hi.

580
00:23:34,682 --> 00:23:38,019
So, this is our sweet spot.

581
00:23:38,052 --> 00:23:40,955
First time, it's so exciting.

582
00:23:40,988 --> 00:23:43,224
I remember my first time
like it was,

583
00:23:43,257 --> 00:23:44,892
uh, 10 years ago.

584
00:23:44,926 --> 00:23:46,560
(chuckling)

585
00:23:46,594 --> 00:23:48,863
Uh, I guess it kinda depends
on who this is for.

586
00:23:48,896 --> 00:23:52,033
I mean, obviously it's
for both of you, right?

587
00:23:52,066 --> 00:23:55,468
Yeah, more for her
in this case than for me,

588
00:23:55,503 --> 00:23:58,239
- but yeah.
- I think for you...

589
00:23:58,272 --> 00:23:59,807
- Mhm.
- ...you might like something

590
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,742
- with vibration because...
- Nah.

591
00:24:01,776 --> 00:24:05,046
...you'll also have a bit
of clitoral stimulation during.

592
00:24:05,079 --> 00:24:07,615
- Ooh.
- So, that could be really nice.

593
00:24:07,648 --> 00:24:10,483
I think... I think we don't
need to do vibration.

594
00:24:10,518 --> 00:24:12,553
Let's just...
let's skip the vibration.

595
00:24:12,586 --> 00:24:14,622
Let's skip
any bells and whistles,

596
00:24:14,655 --> 00:24:16,691
and really
what we're looking for

597
00:24:16,724 --> 00:24:19,260
is just kinda the VW Bug

598
00:24:19,293 --> 00:24:21,729
of strap-ons.

599
00:24:21,762 --> 00:24:23,831
We do have
a beginner strap-on actually.

600
00:24:23,864 --> 00:24:26,033
Oh, that is, that says,
"Beginner strap-on" right there,

601
00:24:26,067 --> 00:24:28,569
- "For him."
- It's 4-and-a-half inches.

602
00:24:28,602 --> 00:24:30,871
- Okay.
- So, I think plus belly...

603
00:24:30,905 --> 00:24:33,240
I was gonna say, if...
do we need, like...

604
00:24:33,274 --> 00:24:35,142
I think you're gonna
want more length, personally.

605
00:24:35,176 --> 00:24:37,211
Personally, I would say
you're gonna want more length

606
00:24:37,244 --> 00:24:39,246
given belly and.

607
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:42,950
Okay, I would suggest
going modular.

608
00:24:42,984 --> 00:24:44,885
We've got
a couple harness options.

609
00:24:44,919 --> 00:24:46,954
This is our most popular,
this is my favorite.

610
00:24:46,988 --> 00:24:48,889
- I have this one actually.
- Oh, you have this one?

611
00:24:48,923 --> 00:24:50,591
Yeah, this one's
really, really great.

612
00:24:50,624 --> 00:24:53,794
Super well priced,
really easy to use.

613
00:24:53,828 --> 00:24:55,563
Um, not super intimidating.

614
00:24:55,596 --> 00:24:58,833
Can you just tell me, what...
what are these?

615
00:24:58,866 --> 00:25:02,136
This is, um, if you want
a dick on your dick.

616
00:25:02,169 --> 00:25:03,771
Uh, oh, that's just if...

617
00:25:03,804 --> 00:25:05,272
- Length.
- ...you have a small dick

618
00:25:05,306 --> 00:25:06,974
- and you want a bigger dick?
- You don't necessarily

619
00:25:07,008 --> 00:25:08,976
have to have a small dick,
it's for any size dick,

620
00:25:09,010 --> 00:25:11,312
but if you want more length.

621
00:25:11,345 --> 00:25:13,848
So, I... I would go here.

622
00:25:13,881 --> 00:25:15,549
It's a really good color.

623
00:25:15,583 --> 00:25:17,752
- If it's your favorite.
- Yeah, I would go here.

624
00:25:17,785 --> 00:25:19,887
- And then...
- Can I just ask,

625
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:22,990
um, is something that you use
with your current partner?

626
00:25:23,024 --> 00:25:25,826
It is something I have used
with past partners, yes.

627
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:28,562
Um, and without
getting too personal...

628
00:25:28,596 --> 00:25:30,131
I guess as a general question,
'cause I think

629
00:25:30,164 --> 00:25:32,566
what he's getting at is,
a lot of straight couples

630
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,668
- use this, right?
- Definitely.

631
00:25:34,702 --> 00:25:36,237
- That's what I was asking.
- Definitely, plenty of

632
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:40,307
- straight couples use these.
- But, is your partner a...?

633
00:25:43,244 --> 00:25:45,279
So, I would say

634
00:25:45,312 --> 00:25:47,882
this would be
a great place to go

635
00:25:47,915 --> 00:25:49,817
if you wanna
go for something modular,

636
00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:53,254
where you can purchase
a harness and also a dildo.

637
00:25:53,287 --> 00:25:55,089
And are these the only
two options for dildos?

638
00:25:55,122 --> 00:25:57,358
No, we have a plethora
of options.

639
00:25:57,391 --> 00:25:59,360
Uh, would you like to see them?

640
00:25:59,393 --> 00:26:01,729
- Okay, there we go.
- Good.

641
00:26:01,762 --> 00:26:03,998
- And that'll be all?
- And some of this.

642
00:26:04,031 --> 00:26:06,700
- Plus lube, okay.
- I got this one.

643
00:26:06,734 --> 00:26:08,235
- Thanks, babe.
- Yeah.

644
00:26:08,269 --> 00:26:18,179
(♪♪♪)

645
00:26:37,798 --> 00:26:39,700
All right, come here,
I love you.

646
00:26:39,733 --> 00:26:41,268
I just want you to know

647
00:26:41,302 --> 00:26:44,038
your mama's dick
is bigger than mine is,

648
00:26:44,071 --> 00:26:46,073
and, um, I'm okay with that,

649
00:26:46,107 --> 00:26:49,743
because I am
a modern, evolved man

650
00:26:49,777 --> 00:26:51,979
- in a modern, evolved world.
- Mhm.

651
00:26:52,012 --> 00:26:55,316
And, um, that doesn't make me
feel insecure at all.

652
00:26:55,349 --> 00:26:57,718
- Okay, okay.
- Mhm.

653
00:26:57,751 --> 00:26:59,420
Okay, okay.

654
00:26:59,453 --> 00:27:02,256
- I like this angle.
- Thanks.

655
00:27:02,289 --> 00:27:05,025
I'm gonna need your butt
a little higher.

656
00:27:05,059 --> 00:27:06,760
- Okay.
- Like, put a little arch

657
00:27:06,794 --> 00:27:08,996
in your back, a little cat cow.

658
00:27:09,029 --> 00:27:10,664
- Uh-huh.
- Okay.

659
00:27:10,698 --> 00:27:13,167
Just... I know
what you're feeling.

660
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,069
- Uh-huh, uh-huh.
- I've been there.

661
00:27:15,102 --> 00:27:18,272
Just put the weight
on the elbows.

662
00:27:18,305 --> 00:27:20,141
- Okay.
- And let yourself

663
00:27:20,174 --> 00:27:22,710
rock forward.

664
00:27:22,743 --> 00:27:24,445
It's better, right?

665
00:27:24,478 --> 00:27:26,881
You're gonna feel

666
00:27:26,914 --> 00:27:28,415
- a little something...
- Okay!

667
00:27:28,449 --> 00:27:32,219
Um, stop, stop, stop, stop,
stop, stop, stop, stop.

668
00:27:32,253 --> 00:27:34,221
- I didn't even put it in.
- I know.

669
00:27:34,255 --> 00:27:36,790
If I say, "Stop,"
you stop immediately.

670
00:27:36,824 --> 00:27:38,425
- Immediately.
- Safe word:

671
00:27:38,459 --> 00:27:40,861
"Immediately."

672
00:27:40,895 --> 00:27:43,130
"Immediately" is our safe word?

673
00:27:43,164 --> 00:27:46,133
No, "stop" is our safe word,
I'm just... I was just trying

674
00:27:46,167 --> 00:27:48,702
to reiterate
that if I say, "Stop,"

675
00:27:48,736 --> 00:27:50,704
that you immediately stop.

676
00:27:50,738 --> 00:27:53,140
Yes, and maybe,

677
00:27:53,174 --> 00:27:55,843
just throwing out there,
we pause,

678
00:27:55,876 --> 00:27:58,078
as opposed to, like,
pull everything apart.

679
00:27:58,112 --> 00:28:00,714
Okay, except if I tell you
to pull it out, you pull it out.

680
00:28:00,748 --> 00:28:01,916
- Yes.
- Okay.

681
00:28:01,949 --> 00:28:03,951
- Yeah.
- Okay, I just, you know,

682
00:28:03,984 --> 00:28:06,220
- I would do the same for you.
- You would?

683
00:28:06,253 --> 00:28:09,190
- Yeah.
- All right.

684
00:28:09,223 --> 00:28:12,893
- Just breathe.
- Okay, huh!

685
00:28:12,927 --> 00:28:15,863
- Huh!
- It's a familiar.

686
00:28:15,896 --> 00:28:18,432
- It's me.
- Ah, ah, ah, ah!

687
00:28:18,465 --> 00:28:20,467
Breathe.

688
00:28:20,501 --> 00:28:22,970
It's okay, are you okay?

689
00:28:23,003 --> 00:28:24,338
- Mhm.
- Okay, I want you to...

690
00:28:24,371 --> 00:28:26,974
I want you to enjoy it,
and if you don't, it's...

691
00:28:27,007 --> 00:28:29,977
we're just gonna pause.

692
00:28:30,010 --> 00:28:31,979
Just let me breathe, just stop
right there and let me breathe.

693
00:28:32,012 --> 00:28:33,480
Uh-huh.

694
00:28:33,515 --> 00:28:36,083
(breathing laboriously)

695
00:28:36,116 --> 00:28:37,785
You're doing so good.

696
00:28:37,818 --> 00:28:40,154
- You're doing so good, baby.
- Okay.

697
00:28:40,187 --> 00:28:43,290
I'm just gonna...
your back is all sweaty.

698
00:28:43,324 --> 00:28:45,859
- Okay, um...
- Like it, do you like it?

699
00:28:45,893 --> 00:28:48,062
- Yeah, I'm just...
- You do?

700
00:28:48,095 --> 00:28:51,165
- I'm gonna move for a second.
- Yeah.

701
00:28:51,198 --> 00:28:53,500
- Okay.
- Yeah, lean in.

702
00:28:56,971 --> 00:29:00,007
- Okay.
- Uh-huh.

703
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:03,110
That's what it looks like.

704
00:29:03,143 --> 00:29:05,346
- Okay.
- Yeah.

705
00:29:07,982 --> 00:29:10,484
- Get it.
- Okay.

706
00:29:10,518 --> 00:29:12,453
- Oh, sweetie!
- Ah, ah!

707
00:29:12,486 --> 00:29:14,288
- Oh, sweetie.
- Ah, ah!

708
00:29:14,321 --> 00:29:16,558
- Uh-huh, uh-huh.
- Ah, ah!

709
00:29:16,591 --> 00:29:19,393
- Ah, ah!
- Oh, sweetie, sweetie!

710
00:29:19,426 --> 00:29:22,196
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
- Ah, ah!

711
00:29:22,229 --> 00:29:23,797
Yeah!

712
00:29:23,831 --> 00:29:25,899
Yeah.

713
00:29:25,933 --> 00:29:35,843
(♪♪♪)

714
00:29:37,478 --> 00:29:40,981
I'm... I'm the woman.

715
00:29:41,015 --> 00:29:43,417
I'm the woman.

716
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:53,427
(♪♪♪)

717
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:56,263
(grunting)

718
00:29:56,297 --> 00:29:57,865
Honey?

719
00:29:57,898 --> 00:29:59,833
Are you okay?

720
00:29:59,867 --> 00:30:01,468
Yes, and I'm sorry.

721
00:30:01,503 --> 00:30:03,505
(♪♪♪)

722
00:30:03,538 --> 00:30:05,939
Where'd you fucking go?

723
00:30:05,973 --> 00:30:10,177
(♪♪♪)

724
00:30:10,210 --> 00:30:11,513
Fuck!

725
00:30:11,546 --> 00:30:20,154
(♪♪♪)

726
00:30:20,187 --> 00:30:22,156
(whirring)

727
00:30:27,194 --> 00:30:29,496
(birds chirping)

728
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,503
(yawning)

729
00:30:39,406 --> 00:30:41,909
(squealing)

730
00:30:52,319 --> 00:30:54,054
You're awake?

731
00:30:54,088 --> 00:30:55,923
Mhm.

732
00:30:55,956 --> 00:30:58,359
- Good mornin'.
- Good morning, baby.

733
00:31:01,596 --> 00:31:04,198
I feel great!

734
00:31:04,231 --> 00:31:06,300
- Great.
- Honey,

735
00:31:06,333 --> 00:31:09,571
I just slept through
the whole night.

736
00:31:09,604 --> 00:31:12,172
I know, you didn't
get up and pee, or anything.

737
00:31:12,206 --> 00:31:14,308
I can't believe it.

738
00:31:14,341 --> 00:31:16,043
Uh, you deserve it.

739
00:31:16,076 --> 00:31:18,445
It's like a miracle.

740
00:31:18,479 --> 00:31:21,448
I haven't slept a whole night

741
00:31:21,482 --> 00:31:23,585
the entire third trimester.

742
00:31:23,618 --> 00:31:26,353
I know.

743
00:31:26,387 --> 00:31:28,422
Ahh.

744
00:31:28,455 --> 00:31:30,391
I'm glad.

745
00:31:30,424 --> 00:31:32,694
I wore myself out yesterday.

746
00:31:32,727 --> 00:31:34,562
- Yeah, you sure did.
- Yep.

747
00:31:34,596 --> 00:31:36,363
Yeah.

748
00:31:36,397 --> 00:31:39,266
Oh, how do you feel?

749
00:31:39,299 --> 00:31:42,035
Mm, I'm okay.

750
00:31:42,069 --> 00:31:44,539
I feel a little funny,
I didn't sleep much,

751
00:31:44,572 --> 00:31:46,974
- but I'm all right.
- No?

752
00:31:47,007 --> 00:31:49,644
Uh-uh, it was a bit
of a fraught night.

753
00:31:51,478 --> 00:31:53,280
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

754
00:31:53,313 --> 00:31:57,017
- It's okay.
- I felt so profoundly...

755
00:31:59,621 --> 00:32:01,221
...completed.

756
00:32:01,255 --> 00:32:03,558
I really appreciate it,
I'm sorry you had

757
00:32:03,591 --> 00:32:06,059
such a bad night.

758
00:32:06,093 --> 00:32:08,128
- Mm.
- I mean, don't you feel

759
00:32:08,162 --> 00:32:10,130
like we...

760
00:32:10,164 --> 00:32:11,599
we broke the mold?

761
00:32:11,633 --> 00:32:15,102
I feel like I... I broke the...

762
00:32:15,135 --> 00:32:16,638
the mold in some way.

763
00:32:16,671 --> 00:32:19,273
I, like, feel funky and weird.

764
00:32:19,306 --> 00:32:21,208
- Hm.
- Like,

765
00:32:21,241 --> 00:32:23,545
we can do anything.

766
00:32:23,578 --> 00:32:26,046
There's no rules,
we can do anything.

767
00:32:26,079 --> 00:32:27,615
Hm.

768
00:32:30,284 --> 00:32:32,152
No.

769
00:32:32,186 --> 00:32:35,088
I think...

770
00:32:35,122 --> 00:32:38,593
I mean,

771
00:32:38,626 --> 00:32:40,994
okay, if I'm being
totally honest.

772
00:32:41,028 --> 00:32:43,464
Mhm, which I want you to be.

773
00:32:43,497 --> 00:32:46,133
Okay.

774
00:32:46,166 --> 00:32:47,501
Um.

775
00:32:53,307 --> 00:32:55,743
Do you know how many times
my dad used the word "faggot"

776
00:32:55,777 --> 00:32:58,479
when I was a kid?

777
00:32:58,513 --> 00:33:00,615
That's so bad.

778
00:33:00,648 --> 00:33:03,350
Like, "Faggot this,
and faggot that."

779
00:33:03,383 --> 00:33:05,419
And that didn't even

780
00:33:05,452 --> 00:33:09,256
really mean "gay."

781
00:33:09,289 --> 00:33:11,492
It just meant

782
00:33:11,526 --> 00:33:14,094
"weak."

783
00:33:14,127 --> 00:33:16,598
And so, here I am,

784
00:33:16,631 --> 00:33:18,432
an adult man,

785
00:33:18,465 --> 00:33:21,636
who's in
a loving relationship...

786
00:33:21,669 --> 00:33:23,303
- Mhm.
- ...with a strong

787
00:33:23,337 --> 00:33:25,339
and beautiful woman, who has,

788
00:33:25,372 --> 00:33:27,307
at least biologically speaking,

789
00:33:27,341 --> 00:33:29,611
- proved my manliness.
- Totally.

790
00:33:29,644 --> 00:33:32,446
And all of a sudden
we're doing this thing

791
00:33:32,479 --> 00:33:35,449
where we're... we're conducting
this experiment.

792
00:33:35,482 --> 00:33:37,317
- Yeah?
- And then, the second

793
00:33:37,351 --> 00:33:40,320
it felt good,
my head came back in,

794
00:33:40,354 --> 00:33:43,223
and it was like, "What,
'cause you're a faggot?"

795
00:33:45,158 --> 00:33:47,261
- Okay.
- And... and... and that's terrible,

796
00:33:47,294 --> 00:33:50,397
and I'm sorry
I keep using that word.

797
00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:53,066
It's just,
it's obviously not me talking.

798
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:55,703
- Yeah.
- It's... it's all the baggage

799
00:33:55,737 --> 00:33:58,506
from my hometown,
and from growing up

800
00:33:58,540 --> 00:34:00,675
- with an alpha father...
- Yeah.

801
00:34:00,708 --> 00:34:02,309
...and... and so,
when I was downstairs,

802
00:34:02,342 --> 00:34:04,077
I really started trying
to pick this apart

803
00:34:04,111 --> 00:34:07,314
and go like, "What...
what's at the core of this?"

804
00:34:07,347 --> 00:34:10,083
Because there's two things
that are competing inside of me.

805
00:34:10,117 --> 00:34:12,787
One is that, um,
I wanna be your partner,

806
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:15,389
and I wanna be...
I wanna be truly open

807
00:34:15,422 --> 00:34:17,692
to new experiences
in the universe.

808
00:34:17,725 --> 00:34:19,827
Um, and the other side is,

809
00:34:19,861 --> 00:34:23,430
my dad was a homophobe,
and I just let my wife

810
00:34:23,463 --> 00:34:25,365
fuck me in the ass,

811
00:34:25,399 --> 00:34:28,770
and so all of a sudden
I felt like,

812
00:34:28,803 --> 00:34:30,638
"You're not a man."

813
00:34:30,672 --> 00:34:33,106
And then... and then,
I started thinking about

814
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:35,342
all of the therapy
that I've had,

815
00:34:35,375 --> 00:34:37,512
and... and going like,

816
00:34:37,545 --> 00:34:40,347
"Why is this... you know,
why is this such an issue?"

817
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:41,849
This shouldn't be such an issue,

818
00:34:41,883 --> 00:34:44,519
and maybe I would like it
if we did it again.

819
00:34:44,552 --> 00:34:46,219
If I could get past the shame.

820
00:34:46,253 --> 00:34:48,856
If I could get past
all the stuff that's built up

821
00:34:48,890 --> 00:34:51,158
in my head, and so I think
in the same way

822
00:34:51,191 --> 00:34:53,695
that you had to

823
00:34:53,728 --> 00:34:56,831
go on your journey

824
00:34:56,864 --> 00:34:59,867
to feel more in control,

825
00:34:59,901 --> 00:35:04,404
and... and to feel powerful,

826
00:35:04,438 --> 00:35:06,774
I think I got
some work to do, too.

827
00:35:06,808 --> 00:35:08,643
- Totally.
- You know?

828
00:35:08,676 --> 00:35:11,813
Yeah, what do...
what do you wanna do?

829
00:35:13,948 --> 00:35:16,551
I think I need to punch
somebody in the face.

830
00:35:20,187 --> 00:35:21,756
That...

831
00:35:21,789 --> 00:35:24,792
And also, I think
another important component

832
00:35:24,826 --> 00:35:29,363
of this is that I need
to know what it feels like

833
00:35:29,396 --> 00:35:31,633
to actually take
a full face punch.

834
00:35:33,601 --> 00:35:34,936
You want somebody
to punch you...?

835
00:35:34,969 --> 00:35:38,673
Punch me in the face.

836
00:35:38,706 --> 00:35:41,475
I hate this.

837
00:35:41,509 --> 00:35:43,511
(♪♪♪)

838
00:35:43,544 --> 00:35:45,445
(indistinct remarks)

839
00:35:45,479 --> 00:35:46,781
Okay, jab.

840
00:35:46,814 --> 00:35:48,382
(♪♪♪)

841
00:35:48,415 --> 00:35:49,951
- Hello!
- One, two, one, two.

842
00:35:49,984 --> 00:35:52,319
Uh, hello, back here.

843
00:35:52,352 --> 00:35:54,187
Okay, give me a jab.

844
00:35:54,221 --> 00:35:55,923
- Hey, man.
- Give me a jab.

845
00:35:55,957 --> 00:35:58,325
One, duck, two.

846
00:35:58,358 --> 00:36:00,928
- Hey, what's up?
- Hey, what's up, man?

847
00:36:00,962 --> 00:36:02,362
Ah, it's good to see you.

848
00:36:02,396 --> 00:36:04,264
Hey, what's going on?
I'm Elliot.

849
00:36:04,297 --> 00:36:05,767
- Hi.
- What's your name?

850
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:08,268
- I'm Josh.
- Josh, nice to meet you.

851
00:36:08,301 --> 00:36:10,237
Elliot, Jackie,
these are my friends.

852
00:36:10,270 --> 00:36:11,839
You guys look like
you're hanging tough in here.

853
00:36:11,873 --> 00:36:13,508
Yeah, hooking it up...
what's up, man?

854
00:36:13,541 --> 00:36:16,711
Uh, can I... can I steal you
for, like, 3 minutes?

855
00:36:18,713 --> 00:36:19,847
- Uh, you cool with it?
- Yeah.

856
00:36:19,881 --> 00:36:21,381
- Are we cool with that?
- Is that cool?

857
00:36:21,415 --> 00:36:22,917
- 4 minutes, it'll be real quick.
- Okay, a couple.

858
00:36:22,950 --> 00:36:24,819
- I got a little favor to ask.
- It's fine.

859
00:36:24,852 --> 00:36:26,921
All right, Josh,
100 jumping jacks.

860
00:36:26,954 --> 00:36:28,422
Count 'em out.

861
00:36:28,455 --> 00:36:29,691
When you're done,
I'll be back, okay?

862
00:36:29,724 --> 00:36:31,291
- All right.
- Okay.

863
00:36:31,324 --> 00:36:34,361
- I'll bring him right back.
- All right.

864
00:36:34,394 --> 00:36:38,900
One, two, three, four, five...

865
00:36:38,933 --> 00:36:42,570
Um, so here's the thing.

866
00:36:42,603 --> 00:36:45,439
Yeah?

867
00:36:45,472 --> 00:36:47,508
I would like you
to hit me in the face

868
00:36:47,542 --> 00:36:49,376
as hard as you can.

869
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:53,881
Fight Club.

870
00:36:53,915 --> 00:36:55,983
Hm?

871
00:36:56,017 --> 00:36:57,451
You're Fight Clubbing me?

872
00:36:57,484 --> 00:36:58,853
Hey, did you do
a Fight Club to me?

873
00:36:58,886 --> 00:37:00,588
(chuckling)

874
00:37:00,621 --> 00:37:02,557
Oh, shit, that is from
Fight Club, isn't it?

875
00:37:02,590 --> 00:37:05,325
No, I kinda...
in the back of my head,

876
00:37:05,358 --> 00:37:08,495
I had some recognition,
but I didn't realize

877
00:37:08,529 --> 00:37:10,330
- it was something...
- It was it exactly.

878
00:37:10,363 --> 00:37:12,533
- That's exactly what it's from.
- Yeah.

879
00:37:12,567 --> 00:37:14,736
Okay, so I know you have to
get back in there.

880
00:37:14,769 --> 00:37:17,437
This is real quick,
if you could just punch me,

881
00:37:17,471 --> 00:37:19,974
and, um, if it's okay...

882
00:37:20,007 --> 00:37:22,744
if it's okay, I'd love to
be able to punch you back.

883
00:37:22,777 --> 00:37:24,879
- That would be super helpful.
- I can't tell

884
00:37:24,912 --> 00:37:26,379
if you guys are fucking with me.

885
00:37:26,413 --> 00:37:28,616
- Is this real?
- It...

886
00:37:28,649 --> 00:37:30,350
Yeah.

887
00:37:30,383 --> 00:37:32,285
(laughing)

888
00:37:32,319 --> 00:37:33,921
- No, no way.
- Okay, um.

889
00:37:33,955 --> 00:37:35,056
You're out of your fucking mind.

890
00:37:35,089 --> 00:37:35,957
I'm not gonna punch you.

891
00:37:35,990 --> 00:37:38,291
- Here, here's the thing.
- In the face?

892
00:37:38,325 --> 00:37:39,994
I swear to God
I won't be upset.

893
00:37:40,027 --> 00:37:41,461
I won't either.

894
00:37:41,495 --> 00:37:42,530
She won't either.

895
00:37:42,563 --> 00:37:43,831
Okay, here's the thing.

896
00:37:43,865 --> 00:37:45,633
Do you remember
at our baby shower

897
00:37:45,666 --> 00:37:46,901
when you came
up to me at the end,

898
00:37:46,934 --> 00:37:48,603
and you hugged me,
and you were just like,

899
00:37:48,636 --> 00:37:49,904
"Brother, anything you need...

900
00:37:49,937 --> 00:37:51,773
- Yeah.
- ...anything at all?"

901
00:37:51,806 --> 00:37:54,041
- Yeah, I...
- This is it.

902
00:37:54,075 --> 00:37:55,375
Not gonna do it, I'm sorry.

903
00:37:55,408 --> 00:37:56,644
- I lied to you.
- This is it.

904
00:37:56,677 --> 00:37:58,345
I can't.

905
00:37:58,378 --> 00:37:59,514
- I've...
- Okay, so I'll tell,

906
00:37:59,547 --> 00:38:00,982
I'll tell, I'll tell you why,
I'll tell you why

907
00:38:01,015 --> 00:38:02,617
'cause I do think
it'll make a difference.

908
00:38:02,650 --> 00:38:03,416
It's this thing that

909
00:38:03,450 --> 00:38:04,619
- Jackie and I are doing...
- Okay.

910
00:38:04,652 --> 00:38:07,021
...because, uh, because
we're about to have a baby...

911
00:38:07,054 --> 00:38:07,955
- Yeah, yeah.
- ...and we're trying to become

912
00:38:07,989 --> 00:38:09,489
fully realized humans.

913
00:38:09,524 --> 00:38:10,792
I mean, you know,
I've talked to you about

914
00:38:10,825 --> 00:38:12,392
my dad stuff, my rape stuff.

915
00:38:12,425 --> 00:38:13,661
You know, I've been in therapy

916
00:38:13,694 --> 00:38:16,030
since I was
fuckin' 18 years old.

917
00:38:16,063 --> 00:38:18,633
And, obviously,
you know, they're like,

918
00:38:18,666 --> 00:38:19,834
"You shouldn't punch people."

919
00:38:19,867 --> 00:38:22,804
So, I punch walls,
I, like, kick things,

920
00:38:22,837 --> 00:38:25,640
but what I've never done
in my entire life

921
00:38:25,673 --> 00:38:27,575
is I've never been
punched in the face.

922
00:38:27,608 --> 00:38:28,375
And my dad used to do

923
00:38:28,408 --> 00:38:30,077
- this to me all the time.
- Yeah.

924
00:38:30,111 --> 00:38:34,048
So, I am so afraid of this,
and I just, I, I just need,

925
00:38:34,081 --> 00:38:35,448
- I need the full thing.
- Not happening.

926
00:38:35,482 --> 00:38:38,418
I appreciate everything
you just told me.

927
00:38:38,451 --> 00:38:41,122
I'm sorry you had a mean dad.

928
00:38:41,155 --> 00:38:43,991
And whatever you guys
are going through

929
00:38:44,025 --> 00:38:45,092
feels weird.

930
00:38:45,126 --> 00:38:47,728
Uh, I can't help you with this.

931
00:38:47,762 --> 00:38:50,097
I'm facing

932
00:38:50,131 --> 00:38:52,133
my biggest fear.

933
00:38:52,166 --> 00:38:55,435
This wall of fear.

934
00:38:55,468 --> 00:38:57,505
And her and I together,

935
00:38:57,538 --> 00:39:00,775
are gonna get over
that fuckin' wall.

936
00:39:00,808 --> 00:39:01,742
Cool, man.

937
00:39:01,776 --> 00:39:03,044
So we can be...

938
00:39:03,077 --> 00:39:05,146
I'm not goin' over
the wall with you.

939
00:39:05,179 --> 00:39:08,115
I don't need you to,
I just need you to punch me.

940
00:39:08,149 --> 00:39:09,650
There's a kid
in the other room waiting.

941
00:39:09,684 --> 00:39:11,451
You punch guys in the face

942
00:39:11,484 --> 00:39:12,485
- every day!
- Yeah,

943
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:14,655
'cause I don't care
about them, and also...

944
00:39:14,689 --> 00:39:16,624
Okay, can I punch
you in the face?

945
00:39:16,657 --> 00:39:18,491
- No.
- Please?

946
00:39:18,526 --> 00:39:19,927
Absolutely not.

947
00:39:19,961 --> 00:39:21,963
I just need to
punch you in the face.

948
00:39:21,996 --> 00:39:23,764
- Well, okay.
- Dude, no.

949
00:39:23,798 --> 00:39:25,633
One of the two
is gonna happen.

950
00:39:25,666 --> 00:39:27,034
Neither of the two are gonna

951
00:39:27,068 --> 00:39:28,501
- happen actually.
- Okay, punch me in the face.

952
00:39:28,536 --> 00:39:30,771
- I am not gonna...
- Punch me in the face.

953
00:39:30,805 --> 00:39:31,939
- Elliot, I'm not gonna...
- Punch me in the face.

954
00:39:31,973 --> 00:39:32,840
- I'm not punching...
- I'm gonna punch you in the face

955
00:39:32,874 --> 00:39:34,542
if you don't punch
me in the face.

956
00:39:34,575 --> 00:39:35,475
I'm gonna
punch you in the face.

957
00:39:35,509 --> 00:39:37,511
You're not gonna
punch me in the face.

958
00:39:37,545 --> 00:39:38,613
I'm gonna... Punch me in the face!

959
00:39:38,646 --> 00:39:39,446
- No one's getting punched.
- Punch me in the face!

960
00:39:39,479 --> 00:39:40,413
How 'bout this,
no one's fucking

961
00:39:40,447 --> 00:39:42,083
- getting punched.
- I'm gonna punch you!

962
00:39:42,116 --> 00:39:43,450
Ah!

963
00:39:43,483 --> 00:39:44,986
(groaning)

964
00:39:45,019 --> 00:39:46,621
Ho!

965
00:39:46,654 --> 00:39:47,889
Ooh.

966
00:39:47,922 --> 00:39:49,156
That was...

967
00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:50,625
Are you bleeding?

968
00:39:50,658 --> 00:39:52,627
- Ah, shit.
- You're fuckin' bleeding.

969
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:53,594
- Oh, brother!
- Fuckin' damn it, man.

970
00:39:53,628 --> 00:39:54,996
I'm sorry, but that was amazing!

971
00:39:55,029 --> 00:39:56,597
- What are you doing?
- Come on, that was amazing.

972
00:39:56,631 --> 00:39:58,165
That wasn't amazing,
that was ridiculous.

973
00:39:58,199 --> 00:39:59,432
Get the fuck outta here.

974
00:39:59,466 --> 00:40:00,534
Josh, go in the other room.

975
00:40:00,568 --> 00:40:02,469
- Oh!
- Okay, okay, so you're mad.

976
00:40:02,503 --> 00:40:04,105
- Jackie...
- So, punch me in the face!

977
00:40:04,138 --> 00:40:04,972
- I'm gonna...
- Come on, come on, come on,

978
00:40:05,006 --> 00:40:06,107
- come on, come on.
- I need you to go.

979
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:07,141
Dude, dude, dude, dude, come...

980
00:40:07,174 --> 00:40:09,810
(thudding)

981
00:40:09,844 --> 00:40:11,212
Oh!

982
00:40:11,245 --> 00:40:13,581
- Oh!
- Dude, I'm sorry.

983
00:40:13,614 --> 00:40:14,982
Oh!

984
00:40:15,016 --> 00:40:15,917
- Hey!
- Honey, honey.

985
00:40:15,950 --> 00:40:18,152
- Elliot, I'm sorry.
- Oh, it's okay.

986
00:40:18,185 --> 00:40:19,520
Flip over.

987
00:40:19,553 --> 00:40:21,989
Oh, my God.

988
00:40:22,023 --> 00:40:23,891
Dude, I'm so sorry.

989
00:40:23,925 --> 00:40:24,992
Elliot, I'm so sorry.

990
00:40:25,026 --> 00:40:27,929
(deliriously laughing)

991
00:40:27,962 --> 00:40:29,196
You're okay?

992
00:40:29,230 --> 00:40:30,564
Yeah.

993
00:40:30,598 --> 00:40:33,534
- He's okay!
- Oh, I went out.

994
00:40:33,567 --> 00:40:35,569
- I went out!
- Yeah.

995
00:40:35,603 --> 00:40:36,637
Oh, that really...

996
00:40:36,671 --> 00:40:38,572
- Fuck you!
- That was crazy!

997
00:40:38,606 --> 00:40:39,907
Can I help you,
let me help you both up,

998
00:40:39,941 --> 00:40:41,676
then you can get
the fuck out, okay?

999
00:40:41,709 --> 00:40:43,010
- Sorry. You did it!
- Do I have a black eye?

1000
00:40:43,044 --> 00:40:43,844
- You do a little bit!
- Yeah, you have a black eye

1001
00:40:43,878 --> 00:40:45,046
'cause you're a fuckin' idiot.

1002
00:40:45,079 --> 00:40:45,880
Now, can you please leave?

1003
00:40:45,913 --> 00:40:47,648
Dude, I know
you're upset, but...

1004
00:40:47,682 --> 00:40:48,950
- You have no idea.
- ...it's the best thing

1005
00:40:48,983 --> 00:40:49,684
- in my entire life.
- I don't wanna

1006
00:40:49,717 --> 00:40:50,818
- hear it right now.
- Can I?

1007
00:40:50,851 --> 00:40:51,686
No, don't touch me.

1008
00:40:51,719 --> 00:40:54,121
Okay, some day
you're gonna understand.

1009
00:40:54,155 --> 00:40:55,089
No, I won't!

1010
00:40:55,122 --> 00:40:56,824
You'll be lucky if
we talk some day soon.

1011
00:40:56,857 --> 00:40:57,758
- Get the fuck out, Elliot.
- I love you.

1012
00:40:57,792 --> 00:40:59,260
- No, Jackie.
- Let's get out.

1013
00:40:59,293 --> 00:41:01,529
- Okay, I feel you.
- Let's go. Thank you.

1014
00:41:01,562 --> 00:41:04,598
No, don't thank me,
just fuckin' go.

1052
00:43:06,887 --> 00:43:07,855
First of all, we have to

1053
00:43:07,888 --> 00:43:09,056
- thank you.
- Oh, my God.

1054
00:43:09,090 --> 00:43:10,925
The things you said to us

1055
00:43:10,958 --> 00:43:12,226
- resonated.
- Something broke open.

1056
00:43:12,259 --> 00:43:13,160
- You asked the question...
- You were like,

1057
00:43:13,194 --> 00:43:14,261
- "What do you need?
- ..."What do you need?"

1058
00:43:14,295 --> 00:43:17,364
I've never been this
confident in my entire life!

1059
00:43:17,398 --> 00:43:19,300
That's, that's, that's great!

1060
00:43:19,333 --> 00:43:22,336
Also, when you were saying
you gotta trust each other,

1061
00:43:22,369 --> 00:43:24,839
- and, like, fuck everybody else.
- And fuck everybody else!

1062
00:43:24,872 --> 00:43:26,874
Everything in us went, "Whoa!

1063
00:43:26,907 --> 00:43:28,342
- Break the cycle."
- Like, stop.

1064
00:43:28,375 --> 00:43:29,310
What do we need?

1065
00:43:29,343 --> 00:43:31,178
- What would do that?
- Yeah, 'cause all that...

1066
00:43:31,212 --> 00:43:32,646
- And the oxytocin...
- Everything you,

1067
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:35,216
everything you said
made sense in our brains,

1068
00:43:35,249 --> 00:43:36,851
- but we've never put it...
- But we had to do it.

1069
00:43:36,884 --> 00:43:38,719
- ..into effect.
- Got it.

1070
00:43:38,752 --> 00:43:41,088
And more stuff
with my dad, obviously.

1071
00:43:41,122 --> 00:43:44,225
- But, like, the thing...
- Her dad's money,

1072
00:43:44,258 --> 00:43:45,025
- drugs.
- I realized

1073
00:43:45,059 --> 00:43:47,995
I needed, sexually,
to give it.

1074
00:43:48,028 --> 00:43:50,264
- I needed to fuck him.
- She wanted to fuck me.

1075
00:43:50,297 --> 00:43:52,867
It just seemed like
the only answer..

1076
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:55,703
So we went to a shop,
and we got a strap-on,

1077
00:43:55,736 --> 00:43:56,904
- and then we went home...
- And then...

1078
00:43:56,937 --> 00:43:57,838
...and we did it,

1079
00:43:57,872 --> 00:43:59,940
and it hurt,

1080
00:43:59,974 --> 00:44:00,875
um, for me.

1081
00:44:00,908 --> 00:44:02,343
For you...

1082
00:44:02,376 --> 00:44:04,879
Great, but emotionally,

1083
00:44:04,912 --> 00:44:08,782
- I felt like a rock star.
- Mm-hm.

1084
00:44:08,816 --> 00:44:10,918
- And then...
- And then, I cried.

1085
00:44:10,951 --> 00:44:13,120
I mean, I didn't cry
around you because I didn't,

1086
00:44:13,154 --> 00:44:15,389
I didn't want that to tamp down,

1087
00:44:15,422 --> 00:44:17,358
- you know, your moment because...
- And how nice is that?

1088
00:44:17,391 --> 00:44:18,993
And then it, the chain reaction.

1089
00:44:19,026 --> 00:44:21,729
Somehow, the Pavlovian
connection between

1090
00:44:21,762 --> 00:44:24,098
masculinity, and sexuality,

1091
00:44:24,131 --> 00:44:28,469
and violence,
the smallness I felt,

1092
00:44:28,502 --> 00:44:30,704
I was six years old again.

1093
00:44:30,738 --> 00:44:34,074
And I was sitting
at my kitchen table

1094
00:44:34,108 --> 00:44:36,043
in my childhood house,

1095
00:44:36,076 --> 00:44:39,380
and I just spilled
a glass of orange juice.

1096
00:44:39,413 --> 00:44:41,048
And my father turned, and he,

1097
00:44:41,081 --> 00:44:43,851
and he cocked a fist
like he was gonna punch me

1098
00:44:43,884 --> 00:44:47,788
because I spilled a fucking
glass of orange juice, okay?

1099
00:44:47,821 --> 00:44:52,059
And that fear has dictated

1100
00:44:52,092 --> 00:44:54,128
so many of the choices
that I've made

1101
00:44:54,161 --> 00:44:57,164
- my entire life.
- Like, the cycle of backing away

1102
00:44:57,198 --> 00:44:59,900
from that energy had to break.

1103
00:44:59,934 --> 00:45:01,468
Because I'm a grown-ass man,

1104
00:45:01,502 --> 00:45:03,437
and I'm about to be a father.

1105
00:45:03,470 --> 00:45:05,039
And so, I can't be scared.

1106
00:45:05,072 --> 00:45:07,174
I can't be scared of a fist,

1107
00:45:07,208 --> 00:45:09,176
or, like, a plastic dick

1108
00:45:09,210 --> 00:45:11,946
the way that I have
been my entire life.

1109
00:45:11,979 --> 00:45:14,014
So, I went to visit my friend.

1110
00:45:14,048 --> 00:45:16,784
- It was amazing!
- And I punched him in the face!

1111
00:45:16,817 --> 00:45:18,285
And he didn't...

1112
00:45:18,319 --> 00:45:19,453
I asked him at first,

1113
00:45:19,486 --> 00:45:21,355
I was like, "Can I, can I..."

1114
00:45:21,388 --> 00:45:23,190
Well, I asked him
if he'd punch me,

1115
00:45:23,224 --> 00:45:25,159
and he was like, "No,
I'm not gonna punch you."

1116
00:45:25,192 --> 00:45:26,493
And I was like, "Come on,
please, punch me."

1117
00:45:26,528 --> 00:45:28,229
- And he was like, "No!"
- Like, don't be a pussy!

1118
00:45:28,262 --> 00:45:30,397
(indistinct speaking)

1119
00:45:30,431 --> 00:45:32,199
- I punched him!
- Got it.

1120
00:45:32,233 --> 00:45:34,868
And then he still
wouldn't punch me!

1121
00:45:34,902 --> 00:45:35,836
So then...

1122
00:45:35,869 --> 00:45:38,506
(laughing)

1123
00:45:38,540 --> 00:45:40,307
- I was amazed.
- And then,

1124
00:45:40,341 --> 00:45:43,444
and then I saw it happen on his
face when he was just like...

1125
00:45:43,477 --> 00:45:45,212
And then, he was like

1126
00:45:45,246 --> 00:45:46,548
black out.

1127
00:45:46,581 --> 00:45:48,782
(indistinct speaking)

1128
00:45:48,816 --> 00:45:51,118
Just punched me in the face.

1129
00:45:51,151 --> 00:45:52,453
It was the best.

1130
00:45:52,486 --> 00:45:54,088
And then, and then...

1131
00:45:54,121 --> 00:45:55,990
(laughing)

1132
00:45:56,023 --> 00:45:58,926
...and then I'm
seeing stars for a second.

1133
00:45:58,959 --> 00:46:00,562
But, I could tell, like...

1134
00:46:00,595 --> 00:46:02,329
But then I came up,

1135
00:46:02,363 --> 00:46:07,468
- and I was clear as day.
- Yeah.

1136
00:46:07,501 --> 00:46:08,637
You know what,
give me a second.

1137
00:46:08,670 --> 00:46:13,541
I'll be right back,
I'm just gonna grab something.

1138
00:46:13,575 --> 00:46:15,109
She's the bomb.

1139
00:46:15,142 --> 00:46:17,011
Yeah.

1140
00:46:17,044 --> 00:46:18,513
Oh, man.

1141
00:46:18,546 --> 00:46:21,015
I could take a nap.

1142
00:46:21,048 --> 00:46:22,550
Yeah.

1143
00:46:22,584 --> 00:46:23,417
Maybe I'll take a nap.

1144
00:46:23,450 --> 00:46:24,385
Can we go take a nap?

1145
00:46:24,418 --> 00:46:26,320
- Wanna go take a nap?
- Just a midday nap?

1146
00:46:26,353 --> 00:46:27,921
And then go to a rave?

1147
00:46:27,955 --> 00:46:29,823
How 'bout the zoo?

1148
00:46:29,857 --> 00:46:31,025
You wanna go to the zoo?

1149
00:46:31,058 --> 00:46:32,459
I think they have
pandas there now.

1150
00:46:32,493 --> 00:46:34,161
Did they get pandas at the zoo?

1151
00:46:34,194 --> 00:46:36,063
So, this is for you.

1152
00:46:36,096 --> 00:46:37,398
What's this?

1153
00:46:37,431 --> 00:46:40,467
It's a full refund.

1154
00:46:40,501 --> 00:46:42,570
- Um.
- You deserve it!

1155
00:46:42,604 --> 00:46:44,171
You deserve so much
more than this.

1156
00:46:44,204 --> 00:46:45,873
It's really okay.

1157
00:46:45,906 --> 00:46:48,375
I don't think there's
any amount of money that

1158
00:46:48,409 --> 00:46:49,376
either of you could give me

1159
00:46:49,410 --> 00:46:52,413
that would make it okay
for us to work together.

1160
00:46:55,015 --> 00:46:56,450
Wha...

1161
00:46:56,483 --> 00:46:59,253
This whole thing, the eye,

1162
00:46:59,286 --> 00:47:02,222
the battery, the pegging,

1163
00:47:02,256 --> 00:47:04,091
- just there's a lot of...
- I don't think it's battery.

1164
00:47:04,124 --> 00:47:06,528
There's a lot of
liability issues here that

1165
00:47:06,561 --> 00:47:09,396
just make me feel
super uncomfortable.

1166
00:47:09,430 --> 00:47:13,233
So, I think it's probably gonna
be best if both of you just

1167
00:47:13,267 --> 00:47:14,335
- get up...
- Wait a minute.

1168
00:47:14,368 --> 00:47:17,338
- ...and leave.
- Wait a minute.

1169
00:47:17,371 --> 00:47:20,608
- Babe?
- Wait a minute.

1170
00:47:20,642 --> 00:47:22,109
So, wait.

1171
00:47:24,178 --> 00:47:26,347
- You want us to go?
- Yeah.

1172
00:47:26,380 --> 00:47:28,082
Are you still
gonna be our doula?

1173
00:47:28,115 --> 00:47:30,552
No, no doula.

1174
00:47:30,585 --> 00:47:32,119
All done.

1175
00:47:32,152 --> 00:47:33,220
Finito.

1176
00:47:33,253 --> 00:47:36,457
Need you both
to get up, and leave.

1177
00:47:36,490 --> 00:47:43,163
(♪♪♪)

1178
00:47:43,197 --> 00:47:45,366
The thing that's just, like,

1179
00:47:45,399 --> 00:47:48,670
nuts is that it's not evident,
and it's not so apparent

1180
00:47:48,703 --> 00:47:51,205
- that this is amazing.
- Other people don't get it.

1181
00:47:51,238 --> 00:47:52,640
No, it's incredible.

1182
00:47:52,674 --> 00:47:54,542
How do other people not get it?

1183
00:47:54,576 --> 00:47:55,976
I mean, and that's hard.

1184
00:47:56,009 --> 00:47:58,412
If I didn't have you,
I'd be so lonely.

1185
00:47:58,445 --> 00:48:01,048
- Honey!
- To have these revelations,

1186
00:48:01,081 --> 00:48:02,449
- to really...
- I see them,

1187
00:48:02,483 --> 00:48:04,118
I see what you're going through.

1188
00:48:04,151 --> 00:48:06,954
...have my brain
break open in these ways.

1189
00:48:06,987 --> 00:48:09,056
And have other people
look at it and go like,

1190
00:48:09,089 --> 00:48:10,391
"Eh, not into it."

1191
00:48:10,424 --> 00:48:13,528
It's so weird 'cause I see you.

1192
00:48:13,561 --> 00:48:15,996
- You see me.
- And look, I get it with Zach.

1193
00:48:16,029 --> 00:48:18,265
Like, I punched my
dear friend in the face,

1194
00:48:18,298 --> 00:48:19,967
- and that might have been...
- Zach? Yeah.

1195
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:20,702
...a little fucked up...

1196
00:48:20,735 --> 00:48:22,637
- But Maya.
- ...but still!

1197
00:48:22,670 --> 00:48:26,541
- Maya.
- She, like, talks the talk,

1198
00:48:26,574 --> 00:48:28,510
- but doesn't walk the walk.
- Walk the walk.

1199
00:48:28,543 --> 00:48:30,277
No, she's a fake truth teller.

1200
00:48:30,310 --> 00:48:33,280
Yeah, she's living
in her own lies.

1201
00:48:33,313 --> 00:48:36,049
Well, I think you,
I think we live in a culture

1202
00:48:36,083 --> 00:48:38,118
that's not prepared
for the truth.

1203
00:48:38,152 --> 00:48:39,186
I think we live in a culture

1204
00:48:39,219 --> 00:48:41,556
- that can't handle the truth.
- I think we do.

1205
00:48:41,589 --> 00:48:43,390
'Cause it's just easier
to lie to each other.

1206
00:48:43,424 --> 00:48:45,527
It is, like, how many times
has your mom been like,

1207
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:47,629
"Do you like the casserole?"
and I'm like, "I love it!"

1208
00:48:47,662 --> 00:48:49,096
Oh, exactly, and how many times

1209
00:48:49,129 --> 00:48:50,698
has my mom been like,
"Was I a good mother?"

1210
00:48:50,732 --> 00:48:52,966
And I'm like, "Of course, Mom."

1211
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,201
We do it, why?

1212
00:48:54,234 --> 00:48:55,969
Just because it's easier.

1213
00:48:56,003 --> 00:48:58,238
It's just like a path
of least resistance.

1214
00:48:58,272 --> 00:49:00,407
I know, and that's why
we're so fucked!

1215
00:49:00,441 --> 00:49:02,710
We're fucked as a country
because of this

1216
00:49:02,744 --> 00:49:06,113
- epidemic of lying.
- We're fucked as a world.

1217
00:49:06,146 --> 00:49:08,148
Maybe we have been afraid
of that with each other.

1218
00:49:08,182 --> 00:49:09,116
That's why we had a...

1219
00:49:09,149 --> 00:49:10,752
And now, for the first time,
we're like,

1220
00:49:10,785 --> 00:49:12,720
"I can totally show you me,

1221
00:49:12,754 --> 00:49:14,188
and you can
totally show me you."

1222
00:49:14,221 --> 00:49:16,123
- We can just, like, be like...
- And we love it!

1223
00:49:16,156 --> 00:49:17,324
...like, "This is me.

1224
00:49:17,357 --> 00:49:18,760
- This is me.
- This is me.

1225
00:49:18,793 --> 00:49:21,395
- And I love you!
- And I love you!

1226
00:49:21,428 --> 00:49:23,130
You are everything!

1227
00:49:23,163 --> 00:49:26,066
- You are everything to me, babe.
- Oh.

1228
00:49:26,099 --> 00:49:28,202
I trust you more than anyone.

1229
00:49:28,235 --> 00:49:31,773
I trust you more than anyone.

1230
00:49:31,806 --> 00:49:34,208
And you're gonna have my baby.

1231
00:49:34,241 --> 00:49:35,677
- And...
- I've been thinkin'.

1232
00:49:35,710 --> 00:49:36,578
What are you thinkin'?

1233
00:49:36,611 --> 00:49:38,580
- Since this whole Maya thing.
- Uh-huh.

1234
00:49:38,613 --> 00:49:41,148
Like, "Ah, where we
gonna find a Doula now?"

1235
00:49:41,181 --> 00:49:43,651
- I know what you're thinkin'.
- I don't, I don't think we need

1236
00:49:43,685 --> 00:49:45,753
some other stranger
coming into this.

1237
00:49:45,787 --> 00:49:48,222
We don't need
anybody else comin' in

1238
00:49:48,255 --> 00:49:51,091
and coaching us
on what the truth

1239
00:49:51,124 --> 00:49:52,459
of our experience is,

1240
00:49:52,493 --> 00:49:54,394
bringing our
baby into the world.

1241
00:49:54,428 --> 00:49:58,198
I think you can be my doula.

1242
00:49:58,232 --> 00:50:00,267
I've never seen
a better doula...

1243
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:01,101
- That makes me...
- ...than the one right in

1244
00:50:01,134 --> 00:50:04,037
- front of me.
- ...makes me wanna cry.

1245
00:50:04,071 --> 00:50:07,107
- But, you're right.
- You can take the pain.

No! There's not

There's not a path over here!

1266
00:51:15,475 --> 00:51:17,177
It can't be that far.

1267
00:51:17,210 --> 00:51:19,146
We were just
on the fucking path!

1268
00:51:19,179 --> 00:51:20,480
No, we weren't
just on the path.

1269
00:51:20,515 --> 00:51:21,481
We were just on the path.

1270
00:51:21,516 --> 00:51:22,650
- We were coming down it.
- By "just," do you mean

1271
00:51:22,684 --> 00:51:24,484
20 minutes ago?

1272
00:51:24,519 --> 00:51:25,853
Now we're way off!

1273
00:51:25,887 --> 00:51:28,288
- Okay.
- Would you stop going up there?

1274
00:51:28,322 --> 00:51:31,124
I really know
the path is not up there.

1275
00:51:31,158 --> 00:51:33,595
I think we might
have to go back up

1276
00:51:33,628 --> 00:51:34,762
to go back down.

1277
00:51:34,796 --> 00:51:36,531
But down is
clearly the direction

1278
00:51:36,564 --> 00:51:38,666
we need to generally be going.

1279
00:51:38,700 --> 00:51:40,233
(animal howling)

1280
00:51:40,267 --> 00:51:43,170
Um.

1281
00:51:43,203 --> 00:51:44,606
Let's go, let's go this way.

1282
00:51:44,639 --> 00:51:45,439
Yeah, okay.

1283
00:51:45,472 --> 00:51:47,875
Yeah, I think down
is a good idea.

1284
00:51:47,909 --> 00:51:50,678
- Ow! Ow.
- Ow.

1285
00:51:50,712 --> 00:51:53,180
- Ah! Ah! Fuck!
- Oh, my gosh.

1286
00:51:53,213 --> 00:51:55,617
- Okay, okay.
- We're... We've gone.

1287
00:51:55,650 --> 00:51:57,518
No, we're totally
off the fucking path.

1288
00:51:57,552 --> 00:51:58,485
- I understand that.
- Will you keep your

1289
00:51:58,519 --> 00:52:01,188
- voice down?
- Can you not be condescending

1290
00:52:01,221 --> 00:52:02,322
- right now?
- I'm asking you

1291
00:52:02,356 --> 00:52:04,892
to keep your voice down
for a very practical reason

1292
00:52:04,926 --> 00:52:06,360
- because I feel like...
- Yeah, what's the practical

1293
00:52:06,393 --> 00:52:07,327
- reason?
- ...we're like,

1294
00:52:07,361 --> 00:52:09,897
like shouting, like,
"Help, we're lost."

1295
00:52:09,931 --> 00:52:12,700
Like, "Help, ow! Ow!"

1296
00:52:12,734 --> 00:52:14,636
- Okay, can, can you...
- If there are gangs out here,

1297
00:52:14,669 --> 00:52:16,203
- they're just gonna like...
- Jackie.

1298
00:52:16,236 --> 00:52:18,271
- Jackie, Jackie, Jackie!
- What?

1299
00:52:18,305 --> 00:52:21,509
Can I just talk for ten seconds

1300
00:52:21,542 --> 00:52:24,512
without you getting
all fucking vicious on me?

1301
00:52:24,545 --> 00:52:26,279
I'd like to make a suggestion.

1302
00:52:26,313 --> 00:52:28,415
Mm-hm?

1303
00:52:28,448 --> 00:52:31,418
Okay, do you
remember that podcast

1304
00:52:31,451 --> 00:52:33,286
that we were listening to

1305
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:36,223
where the two guys
went hiking in Muir Beach

1306
00:52:36,256 --> 00:52:37,959
up by San Francisco?

1307
00:52:37,992 --> 00:52:41,395
And they got up to the top,
and it was dark,

1308
00:52:41,428 --> 00:52:42,329
and one guy was like,

1309
00:52:42,362 --> 00:52:44,231
"Let's just stop here
for the night."

1310
00:52:44,264 --> 00:52:46,299
And the other guy was like,
"I'm gonna keep going.

1311
00:52:46,333 --> 00:52:47,635
- I'm just gonna push through."
- You're not suggesting

1312
00:52:47,669 --> 00:52:48,903
that we are stopping.

1313
00:52:48,936 --> 00:52:50,972
But the second guy,
the guy who kept going,

1314
00:52:51,005 --> 00:52:52,540
he fell off the fucking cliff.

1315
00:52:52,573 --> 00:52:54,441
And the guy who stayed there,

1316
00:52:54,474 --> 00:52:56,978
he found that other guy's
body the next morning

1317
00:52:57,011 --> 00:52:59,647
- with his head bashed in!
- We're not just gonna

1318
00:52:59,681 --> 00:53:01,549
sit like ducks

1319
00:53:01,582 --> 00:53:02,917
- out in the middle of the woods!
- I'm trying to do

1320
00:53:02,950 --> 00:53:04,652
the safest thing.

1321
00:53:04,686 --> 00:53:06,286
I'm trying to do
the safest thing

1322
00:53:06,319 --> 00:53:08,589
for me, and you, and our baby.

1323
00:53:08,623 --> 00:53:10,825
- And you can sleep...
- Honey, just 'cause you hit

1324
00:53:10,858 --> 00:53:11,893
one guy!

1325
00:53:11,926 --> 00:53:13,528
- You hit one guy...
- I'll put my coat on you.

1326
00:53:13,561 --> 00:53:14,796
- ...and now you think...
- I'll make a fire.

1327
00:53:14,829 --> 00:53:16,931
...if we get attacked
by multiple people,

1328
00:53:16,964 --> 00:53:18,533
or animals, or whatever,

1329
00:53:18,566 --> 00:53:20,434
that you're gonna
be able to, like,

1330
00:53:20,467 --> 00:53:21,936
get us through the night?

1331
00:53:21,969 --> 00:53:23,604
Honestly!

1332
00:53:25,506 --> 00:53:28,475
That was really mean.

1333
00:53:28,509 --> 00:53:29,443
- I'm just...
- I mean, that was,

1334
00:53:29,476 --> 00:53:30,978
that was, like...

1335
00:53:31,012 --> 00:53:34,414
Hitting that guy,
you know that was my thing.

1336
00:53:34,448 --> 00:53:35,917
- And...
- You know that that,

1337
00:53:35,950 --> 00:53:39,020
- you know what a huge...
- I know internally

1338
00:53:39,053 --> 00:53:40,555
- that that was...
- ...demarcation

1339
00:53:40,588 --> 00:53:42,557
that was to make me feel

1340
00:53:42,590 --> 00:53:44,759
like I could be a protector

1341
00:53:44,792 --> 00:53:46,794
of you, and our child,

1342
00:53:46,828 --> 00:53:49,296
- and our family, and now I do...
- Like...

1343
00:53:49,329 --> 00:53:50,397
...and now, and now I do.

1344
00:53:50,430 --> 00:53:52,867
And you said you trusted me,
you said you wanted me

1345
00:53:52,900 --> 00:53:54,669
- to be your doula!
- I didn't say that I wanted

1346
00:53:54,702 --> 00:53:56,938
- to sleep in the woods.
- It's not fucking fair!

1347
00:53:56,971 --> 00:53:59,372
I'm not a baby,
I'm not a fucking child!

1348
00:53:59,406 --> 00:54:00,975
- I'm not drawing a line.
- I'm not a goddamn junkie

1349
00:54:01,008 --> 00:54:02,442
like your father!

1350
00:54:02,476 --> 00:54:05,278
Why would you say that?

1351
00:54:05,312 --> 00:54:07,280
What? Is that an unfair thing?

1352
00:54:07,314 --> 00:54:10,350
Is that an untrue thing?

1353
00:54:10,383 --> 00:54:11,853
How...

1354
00:54:11,886 --> 00:54:13,721
I have nothing to say to you.

1355
00:54:13,755 --> 00:54:16,858
I have nothing to say to you.

1356
00:54:16,891 --> 00:54:18,993
I hope that we can
do the rest of this

1357
00:54:19,026 --> 00:54:21,996
silently, or just
part our ways out here.

1358
00:54:22,029 --> 00:54:23,564
Okay, but what if
the thing happens

1359
00:54:23,598 --> 00:54:25,032
that happened in the podcast?

1360
00:54:27,769 --> 00:54:29,737
Well, it was meant to be.

1361
00:54:29,771 --> 00:54:32,272
(dog barking)

1362
00:54:36,443 --> 00:54:38,813

(insects chirping)

1364
00:54:41,381 --> 00:54:43,951
Look, I'm sorry, okay?

1365
00:54:43,985 --> 00:54:46,521
That shouldn't
have been aimed at you.

1366
00:54:46,554 --> 00:54:47,889
No?

1367
00:54:47,922 --> 00:54:50,558
Who should it have
been aimed at, Elliot?

1368
00:54:50,591 --> 00:54:52,894
(car dinging)

1369
00:54:52,927 --> 00:54:55,863

1372
00:55:39,507 --> 00:55:40,541
Do you like it?

1373
00:55:40,575 --> 00:55:42,442
Yeah!

1374
00:55:42,475 --> 00:55:43,611
Sort of picks up this...

1375
00:55:43,644 --> 00:55:46,113
Does anybody need anything else?

1376
00:55:46,147 --> 00:55:48,850
More coffee, or... No.

1377
00:55:48,883 --> 00:55:51,853
When is the baby actually due?

1378
00:55:51,886 --> 00:55:53,955
Uh, one more month.

1379
00:55:53,988 --> 00:55:55,790
Four weeks.

1380
00:55:55,823 --> 00:55:56,924
No more drinks?

1381
00:55:56,958 --> 00:55:57,892
Good, we good?

1382
00:55:57,925 --> 00:55:59,459
Everybody cool?

1383
00:55:59,492 --> 00:56:00,828
For a little while.

1384
00:56:00,862 --> 00:56:03,496
I'm so worried
about your eye, honey.

1385
00:56:03,531 --> 00:56:05,398
- My eye's okay.
- Don't you think we need to put

1386
00:56:05,432 --> 00:56:06,901
- ice on it?
- No, it actually doesn't hurt

1387
00:56:06,934 --> 00:56:07,735
at all anymore.

1388
00:56:07,768 --> 00:56:09,937
It really hurt at first,
but it hurt...

1389
00:56:09,971 --> 00:56:10,905
I'll tell ya about it later.

1390
00:56:10,938 --> 00:56:12,472
- Bob?
- Hey, Dad?

1391
00:56:12,506 --> 00:56:13,841
Bob?

1392
00:56:13,875 --> 00:56:14,942
Yeah?

1393
00:56:14,976 --> 00:56:16,878
Will you come over here?

1394
00:56:16,911 --> 00:56:18,813
Sure, sure.

1395
00:56:18,846 --> 00:56:21,148
(clearing throat)

1396
00:56:23,017 --> 00:56:24,552
Here we go!

1397
00:56:26,787 --> 00:56:27,755
Here I am.

1398
00:56:27,788 --> 00:56:31,458
- Hey!
- Hey, thanks!

1399
00:56:31,491 --> 00:56:32,459
So.

1400
00:56:32,492 --> 00:56:34,195
(clearing throat)

1401
00:56:34,228 --> 00:56:37,064
I know it's weird, it's like
we've called this meeting.

1402
00:56:37,098 --> 00:56:39,499
- Here! Here!
- We've called you here...

1403
00:56:39,533 --> 00:56:42,770
- Today.
- ...today to, uh,

1404
00:56:42,803 --> 00:56:45,438
- well, I'm joking around.
- Well, we have, we have

1405
00:56:45,472 --> 00:56:48,075
because we, um...

1406
00:56:48,109 --> 00:56:49,644
We've been going through this

1407
00:56:49,677 --> 00:56:52,479
intense transformation.

1408
00:56:52,513 --> 00:56:54,882
We've been on kind of a quest.

1409
00:56:54,916 --> 00:56:56,617
- Mm.
- Hm.

1410
00:56:56,651 --> 00:57:00,922
And, um, we've had
some revelations

1411
00:57:00,955 --> 00:57:02,489
- that we'd...
- Oh!

1412
00:57:02,523 --> 00:57:04,792
And we wanted to share
those with you guys.

1413
00:57:04,825 --> 00:57:06,827
(laughing)

1414
00:57:06,861 --> 00:57:09,096
- Yeah.
- Great hummus.

1415
00:57:09,130 --> 00:57:10,765
Thank you.

1416
00:57:10,798 --> 00:57:13,200
You have anymore?

1417
00:57:13,234 --> 00:57:14,969
No.

1418
00:57:15,002 --> 00:57:16,070
- No, there's...
- That's it.

1419
00:57:16,103 --> 00:57:17,772
...there's no more hummus, Dad.

1420
00:57:17,805 --> 00:57:21,242
So when, when
is the baby coming?

1421
00:57:21,275 --> 00:57:24,512
It's in, it's in four weeks,
three and a half.

1422
00:57:24,545 --> 00:57:26,814
Ah, right, right.

1423
00:57:26,847 --> 00:57:28,716
Final countdown,
as they said.

1424
00:57:28,749 --> 00:57:31,752
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1425
00:57:31,786 --> 00:57:35,156
So, we, we have realized that

1426
00:57:35,189 --> 00:57:38,025
the thing

1427
00:57:38,059 --> 00:57:40,861
that set all this off

1428
00:57:40,895 --> 00:57:42,630
was about being parents

1429
00:57:42,663 --> 00:57:46,067
and how we feel
we've been parented.

1430
00:57:46,100 --> 00:57:50,771
- And, and, some of the...
- And...

1431
00:57:50,805 --> 00:57:55,009
...issues we might hold onto,

1432
00:57:55,042 --> 00:57:59,213
which have something
to do with, um...

1433
00:57:59,246 --> 00:58:01,282
- You.
- ...stuff, stuff... You.

1434
00:58:01,315 --> 00:58:04,151
I can't take
my eyes off your eye.

1435
00:58:04,185 --> 00:58:05,152
It's okay, it's okay.

1436
00:58:05,186 --> 00:58:07,254
- I'm okay.
- Don't you want an ice pack

1437
00:58:07,288 --> 00:58:08,089
- or something?
- I'm okay.

1438
00:58:08,122 --> 00:58:10,057
- I'm just so concerned.
- Okay, guys.

1439
00:58:10,091 --> 00:58:11,959
There are lots of good things.

1440
00:58:11,993 --> 00:58:14,295
It can hemorrhage,
you can get a hemorrhage

1441
00:58:14,328 --> 00:58:15,763
- in your eye and a blood clot.
- He's not gonna get,

1442
00:58:15,796 --> 00:58:17,031
he's not gonna
get a hemorrhage.

1443
00:58:17,064 --> 00:58:18,933
- My eye is fine.
- We do need to, you know,

1444
00:58:18,966 --> 00:58:21,902
I just... What did you wanna say?

1445
00:58:21,936 --> 00:58:24,805
We just need to be

1446
00:58:24,839 --> 00:58:28,142
- honest.
- Okay, honest, go.

1447
00:58:28,175 --> 00:58:31,579
So you have your
hand on your cheek?

1448
00:58:31,612 --> 00:58:33,047
Yeah.

1449
00:58:33,080 --> 00:58:35,182
- Um, do you wanna? Or, should I?
- I can take it off.

1450
00:58:35,216 --> 00:58:36,884
Should I?

1451
00:58:36,917 --> 00:58:38,619
- Should I? Okay.
- Okay.

1452
00:58:38,652 --> 00:58:41,555
Okay, Dad, I'm afraid of you.

1453
00:58:42,757 --> 00:58:44,158
(chuckling)

1454
00:58:44,191 --> 00:58:47,128
Right now?

1455
00:58:47,161 --> 00:58:49,697
Um, always.

1456
00:58:49,730 --> 00:58:51,599
Always, I always have been.

1457
00:58:51,632 --> 00:58:54,802
Your, um, anger, um,

1458
00:58:54,835 --> 00:58:56,137
well, it scared me
when I was a kid

1459
00:58:56,170 --> 00:58:58,672
'cause I was much
smaller than you.

1460
00:58:58,706 --> 00:59:03,110
And, um, and it scares me now

1461
00:59:03,144 --> 00:59:08,082
because I don't wanna be
that way with our daughter

1462
00:59:08,115 --> 00:59:09,884
when she's born.

1463
00:59:09,917 --> 00:59:14,288
Well, get rid of that so
you don't pass it on to

1464
00:59:14,321 --> 00:59:16,157
your whippersnapper there.

1465
00:59:16,190 --> 00:59:19,593
Well, yeah, that's,
that's what I'm trying to do.

1466
00:59:19,627 --> 00:59:20,961
- Um...
- But, honey,

1467
00:59:20,995 --> 00:59:23,264
we've dealt with all that stuff.

1468
00:59:23,297 --> 00:59:28,035
Okay, but actually,
we haven't dealt with it at all.

1469
00:59:28,069 --> 00:59:30,738
Do you, do you remember

1470
00:59:30,771 --> 00:59:32,907
what he's talking about?

1471
00:59:32,940 --> 00:59:35,376
Mm, not specifically, but...

1472
00:59:35,409 --> 00:59:37,278
Do you remember all
the times when you would

1473
00:59:37,311 --> 00:59:39,613
pinch me, or you'd spank me,

1474
00:59:39,647 --> 00:59:42,683
or you'd cock a fist back
like you were gonna hit me?

1475
00:59:42,716 --> 00:59:44,618
- Do you remember that? No?
- Mm-mm.

1476
00:59:44,652 --> 00:59:46,187
- No.
- He never punched you

1477
00:59:46,220 --> 00:59:49,056
- with his fist.
- You seriously don't remember?

1478
00:59:49,090 --> 00:59:51,992
I don't remember
a lot of things.

1479
00:59:52,026 --> 00:59:54,728
- Really?
- Really.

1480
00:59:54,762 --> 00:59:56,297
- Really?
- Really.

1481
00:59:56,330 --> 00:59:58,032
- Really?
- Really!

1482
00:59:58,065 --> 00:59:59,333
It's gotta be
in there somewhere.

1483
00:59:59,366 --> 01:00:02,169
- Well, I don't remember...
- You're choosing

1484
01:00:02,203 --> 01:00:03,237
to not remember.

1485
01:00:03,270 --> 01:00:07,041
- You almost drowned him.
- Huh?

1486
01:00:07,074 --> 01:00:08,642
- Nothing.
- What do you wanna say?

1487
01:00:08,676 --> 01:00:09,677
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1488
01:00:09,710 --> 01:00:12,179
Oh, in the pool,
when you got pissed off at me

1489
01:00:12,213 --> 01:00:14,682
because you thought
I should be able to swim,

1490
01:00:14,715 --> 01:00:17,151
and I couldn't swim,
and I was scared of the water,

1491
01:00:17,184 --> 01:00:18,219
and you told me
to figure it out,

1492
01:00:18,252 --> 01:00:21,188
and you turned around
and you went back inside?

1493
01:00:21,222 --> 01:00:23,224
And you swam.

1494
01:00:23,257 --> 01:00:25,025
- Well...
- Could you not laugh?

1495
01:00:25,059 --> 01:00:27,761
Please don't laugh
about it, Richard.

1496
01:00:27,795 --> 01:00:28,796
Mom came out,

1497
01:00:28,829 --> 01:00:31,098
and she had to jump in the pool

1498
01:00:31,132 --> 01:00:33,067
with all her clothes on
and pull me out.

1499
01:00:33,100 --> 01:00:34,068
- Exactly!
- I didn't actually

1500
01:00:34,101 --> 01:00:36,904
magically learn to swim.

1501
01:00:36,937 --> 01:00:39,073
She's a better
swimmer than I am.

1502
01:00:41,442 --> 01:00:45,346
Okay, Dad, do you remember,

1503
01:00:45,379 --> 01:00:48,082
do you remember
the time in church

1504
01:00:48,115 --> 01:00:51,285
where I was six,
and you kept telling me

1505
01:00:51,318 --> 01:00:52,786
to tuck my shirt in,

1506
01:00:52,820 --> 01:00:54,088
and my shirt wouldn't stay in

1507
01:00:54,121 --> 01:00:55,956
because it was
a little too short?

1508
01:00:55,990 --> 01:00:58,092
And you pulled me
over to the side,

1509
01:00:58,125 --> 01:00:59,793
and in front of everybody,

1510
01:00:59,827 --> 01:01:01,228
you pulled my pants down,

1511
01:01:01,262 --> 01:01:02,463
and pulled my shirt down,

1512
01:01:02,496 --> 01:01:06,901
and then you pulled my pants,
like, almost up to my chest?

1513
01:01:06,934 --> 01:01:07,801
Do you remember that?

1514
01:01:07,835 --> 01:01:10,304
Yeah, did we get
your shirt tucked in?

1515
01:01:13,340 --> 01:01:16,710
(clearing throat)

1516
01:01:16,744 --> 01:01:18,913
- I'm just gonna run and get...
- Mom?

1517
01:01:18,946 --> 01:01:21,015
Mom, Mom, Mom, stop, please?

1518
01:01:21,048 --> 01:01:22,983
Please put that down.

1519
01:01:23,017 --> 01:01:24,084
Please put that down.

1520
01:01:24,118 --> 01:01:25,152
You're just tryin' to clean up

1521
01:01:25,186 --> 01:01:26,387
because you're
conflict avoidant,

1522
01:01:26,420 --> 01:01:28,155
and that's always
been your issue,

1523
01:01:28,189 --> 01:01:29,790
and it's crippled you
as a human being.

1524
01:01:29,823 --> 01:01:31,859
Conflict avoidant?
Well, I don't know about that.

1525
01:01:31,892 --> 01:01:35,262
Please stop, please stop!

1526
01:01:35,296 --> 01:01:38,032
I think you need to calm down,

1527
01:01:38,065 --> 01:01:39,333
buster.

1528
01:01:39,366 --> 01:01:41,769
- We're calm!
- We're,

1529
01:01:41,802 --> 01:01:43,971
we are in a safe space.

1530
01:01:44,004 --> 01:01:46,173
- This is a safe space.
- This is a safe space

1531
01:01:46,207 --> 01:01:49,109
- for us to just...
- This is not a safe place.

1532
01:01:49,143 --> 01:01:51,011
This is a safe space

1533
01:01:51,045 --> 01:01:53,214
- to talk about what's really...
- This is the most unsafe place

1534
01:01:53,247 --> 01:01:55,382
I've ever been in my whole life.

1535
01:01:55,416 --> 01:01:57,451
There is nothing
safe about this!

1536
01:01:57,484 --> 01:01:59,186
This is a safe space!

1537
01:01:59,220 --> 01:02:00,955
What does that mean,
a safe space?

1538
01:02:00,988 --> 01:02:02,122
It's not a safe place.

1539
01:02:02,156 --> 01:02:04,258
There's no such thing
as a safe place!

1540
01:02:04,291 --> 01:02:06,260
- What is a safe place?
- This is a family safe place

1541
01:02:06,293 --> 01:02:08,762
to just say everything
you gotta say!

1542
01:02:08,796 --> 01:02:11,031
Dad, I think you're petrified.

1543
01:02:11,065 --> 01:02:12,900
I think you're
fucking petrified,

1544
01:02:12,933 --> 01:02:14,835
and I just wanna
create a safe space

1545
01:02:14,868 --> 01:02:16,036
to talk about why you're scared.

1546
01:02:16,070 --> 01:02:20,908
I'm just frightened to death,
so how we gonna help me?

1547
01:02:20,941 --> 01:02:23,010
- What happened to you?
- When?

1548
01:02:23,043 --> 01:02:25,012
When you were a kid?

1549
01:02:25,045 --> 01:02:27,948
I got the shit beat outta me.

1550
01:02:27,982 --> 01:02:30,284
(sighing)

1551
01:02:31,118 --> 01:02:32,820
I got hit with a fist,

1552
01:02:32,853 --> 01:02:34,421
I got hit with a belt,

1553
01:02:34,455 --> 01:02:36,223
I got hit with a stick.

1554
01:02:36,257 --> 01:02:40,995
I got hit with
whatever was available.

1555
01:02:41,028 --> 01:02:43,931
You don't know real fear

1556
01:02:43,964 --> 01:02:47,101
until you met my dad
when he was younger.

1557
01:02:49,136 --> 01:02:52,239
He'd come home from a trip,
and I don't know where

1558
01:02:52,273 --> 01:02:53,907
the rage was coming from,

1559
01:02:53,941 --> 01:02:58,812
but this guy came
like a fucking lion

1560
01:02:58,846 --> 01:03:01,181
out of nowhere!

1561
01:03:01,215 --> 01:03:03,817
And he would beat
the shit out of me,

1562
01:03:03,851 --> 01:03:08,222
and then he'd leave again
for three days.

1563
01:03:08,255 --> 01:03:11,892
All I knew about
being a parent is

1564
01:03:11,925 --> 01:03:14,128
how he parented me.

1565
01:03:16,463 --> 01:03:19,199
What else is there?

1566
01:03:19,233 --> 01:03:21,536
(deeply breathing)

1567
01:03:24,171 --> 01:03:26,473
Well, I, I, I gotta go.

1568
01:03:26,508 --> 01:03:27,975
Dad, no you don't.

1569
01:03:28,008 --> 01:03:30,844
Well, I gotta go soon.

1570
01:03:30,878 --> 01:03:32,146
Real soon.

1571
01:03:32,179 --> 01:03:34,114
I know we haven't,

1572
01:03:34,148 --> 01:03:35,149
I haven't talked to you yet,

1573
01:03:35,182 --> 01:03:39,053
but I do, I do need you to stay

1574
01:03:39,086 --> 01:03:40,321
because...

1575
01:03:40,354 --> 01:03:42,156
I don't wanna talk
about that other thing.

1576
01:03:42,189 --> 01:03:44,992
Well, we are going
to talk about it

1577
01:03:45,025 --> 01:03:47,394
because this is an open forum.

1578
01:03:47,428 --> 01:03:49,531
It's open forum day.

1579
01:03:49,564 --> 01:03:53,200
And the whole
reason that I got

1580
01:03:53,233 --> 01:03:56,970
sent up on this quest

1581
01:03:57,004 --> 01:04:00,240
was because of your text.

1582
01:04:00,274 --> 01:04:02,309
What text?

1583
01:04:02,343 --> 01:04:04,546
Where you asked us
to pay your rent?

1584
01:04:04,579 --> 01:04:05,547
Mm.

1585
01:04:08,282 --> 01:04:11,653
That's why we're here?

1586
01:04:11,686 --> 01:04:15,089
I'm, I'm sorry I,

1587
01:04:15,122 --> 01:04:16,591
I got backed up.

1588
01:04:16,624 --> 01:04:18,425
I got behind.

1589
01:04:18,459 --> 01:04:19,993
I got behind,

1590
01:04:20,027 --> 01:04:22,963
and that's what family's for.

1591
01:04:22,996 --> 01:04:24,932
Family's there
to help each other.

1592
01:04:24,965 --> 01:04:27,234
I helped you when
you were a little baby.

1593
01:04:27,267 --> 01:04:29,370
Dad, the...

1594
01:04:29,403 --> 01:04:31,338
Can we talk about the pills?

1595
01:04:31,372 --> 01:04:33,374
And the relapse?

1596
01:04:33,407 --> 01:04:35,643
And the fact that
this is the fourth time

1597
01:04:35,677 --> 01:04:37,211
in the last two years

1598
01:04:37,244 --> 01:04:39,647
that you've hit us up for money?

1599
01:04:39,681 --> 01:04:42,650
I'm not a drug addict.

1600
01:04:42,684 --> 01:04:46,220
I have a pain problem

1601
01:04:46,253 --> 01:04:47,354
with my back.

1602
01:04:47,388 --> 01:04:49,591
Had an accident many years ago,

1603
01:04:49,624 --> 01:04:52,292
and sometimes it's
hard to maintain

1604
01:04:52,326 --> 01:04:55,963
the right, you know, balance.

1605
01:04:55,996 --> 01:04:57,030
But, Dad...

1606
01:04:57,064 --> 01:05:00,134
I needed the money
'cause I needed the money!

1607
01:05:00,167 --> 01:05:02,403
And I don't appreciate
you bringing it up.

1608
01:05:02,436 --> 01:05:06,373
- How many pills are you taking?
- I take it as prescribed.

1609
01:05:06,407 --> 01:05:08,475
What is prescribed?

1610
01:05:08,510 --> 01:05:12,146
I don't know.

1611
01:05:12,179 --> 01:05:14,047
I'm sorry, just kill me, okay?

1612
01:05:14,081 --> 01:05:14,948
Just fucking kill me?

1613
01:05:14,982 --> 01:05:17,050
Why don't I just
fucking kill myself?

1614
01:05:17,084 --> 01:05:18,520
Then it'd be over, then you
wouldn't have to... You could

1615
01:05:18,553 --> 01:05:20,254
- raise your kid by yourself.
- Whoa!

1616
01:05:20,287 --> 01:05:22,022
- Okay, Bob...
- I don't give a fuck!

1617
01:05:22,055 --> 01:05:22,956
- Dad!
- Do you understand how

1618
01:05:22,990 --> 01:05:23,991
narcissistic you're being

1619
01:05:24,024 --> 01:05:25,560
- right now?
- Narcissistic.

1620
01:05:25,593 --> 01:05:27,629
- Fuck you!
- Yeah!

1621
01:05:27,662 --> 01:05:30,197
Yeah, I mean,
we drive down here

1622
01:05:30,230 --> 01:05:32,399
five hours to come here,

1623
01:05:32,433 --> 01:05:33,701
and take you out,

1624
01:05:33,735 --> 01:05:36,336
and have a great
time to celebrate

1625
01:05:36,370 --> 01:05:38,405
the birth of our grandkid,

1626
01:05:38,439 --> 01:05:41,709
and you, you wanna have
an inquisition with us

1627
01:05:41,743 --> 01:05:44,746
about the parents that we were

1628
01:05:44,779 --> 01:05:46,581
years and years ago,

1629
01:05:46,614 --> 01:05:48,282
when we didn't know any better?

1630
01:05:48,315 --> 01:05:50,217
We didn't have these
parenting classes,

1631
01:05:50,250 --> 01:05:54,522
this RIE, RIE parenting classes,
whatever the heck

1632
01:05:54,556 --> 01:05:55,590
it was you went to...
You don't understand

1633
01:05:55,623 --> 01:05:58,025
- how different it was.
- I was out on the streets

1634
01:05:58,058 --> 01:05:58,992
when I was a kid.

1635
01:05:59,026 --> 01:06:01,361
I was sellin' papers
on a paper corner,

1636
01:06:01,395 --> 01:06:05,365
on a corner when
I was nine years old.

1637
01:06:05,399 --> 01:06:07,569
- It's different!
- It's real different.

1638
01:06:07,602 --> 01:06:09,236
I had to walk to school,

1639
01:06:09,269 --> 01:06:12,005
miles, when I was
seven years old!

1640
01:06:12,039 --> 01:06:12,874
They would just put me out.

1641
01:06:12,907 --> 01:06:14,274
I mean, anything
could have happened,

1642
01:06:14,308 --> 01:06:15,375
and bad things did happen!

1643
01:06:15,409 --> 01:06:18,680
Yeah, you can't teach
somebody to climb a tree.

1644
01:06:18,713 --> 01:06:22,282
I fell out of a tree!

1645
01:06:22,316 --> 01:06:24,619
That's right, you gotta
learn to climb the tree.

1646
01:06:24,652 --> 01:06:26,487
Cut my ear, I still have a scar.

1647
01:06:26,521 --> 01:06:28,222
Oh, I'll tell you
another thing that happened.

1648
01:06:28,255 --> 01:06:30,692
They would give me a dog,
my mother would give me a dog.

1649
01:06:30,725 --> 01:06:33,193
I'd fall in love with the dog,
I'd have the dog for six months,

1650
01:06:33,227 --> 01:06:35,797
then Daddy would come home,
and give the dog away!

1651
01:06:35,830 --> 01:06:38,600
On Christmas Eve, once,
I had a dog named Stray.

1652
01:06:38,633 --> 01:06:40,200
They gave the dog away
on Christmas Eve,

1653
01:06:40,234 --> 01:06:41,636
and my mother said, "Oh,

1654
01:06:41,669 --> 01:06:43,738
it's a good time to
give the dog to the pound

1655
01:06:43,771 --> 01:06:46,106
because on Christmas,
people will be goin' to get

1656
01:06:46,139 --> 01:06:47,407
dogs for their children."

1657
01:06:47,441 --> 01:06:49,544
You wonder why I didn't want
you to have a dog growin' up?

1658
01:06:49,577 --> 01:06:52,145
- I couldn't bear it!
- It's a different world

1659
01:06:52,179 --> 01:06:53,615
that you're living in

1660
01:06:53,648 --> 01:06:56,450
from the world we
lived in and grew up in.

1661
01:06:56,483 --> 01:06:59,621
And you really don't know
what it was like.

1662
01:06:59,654 --> 01:07:01,523
And feelings, I mean,
it's a luxury,

1663
01:07:01,556 --> 01:07:03,257
it's a privilege
to have feelings,

1664
01:07:03,290 --> 01:07:04,458
to be able to discuss feelings.

1665
01:07:04,491 --> 01:07:08,228
If I would have stopped to
talk to my dad about feelings,

1666
01:07:08,262 --> 01:07:09,764
he woulda knocked me for a loop!

1667
01:07:09,797 --> 01:07:11,533
I didn't even know
I had feelings.

1668
01:07:11,566 --> 01:07:15,068
- What are feelings, man?
- Feelings.

1669
01:07:15,102 --> 01:07:17,271
Good luck!

1670
01:07:17,304 --> 01:07:19,206
Is that what you want,
is you want, you want,

1671
01:07:19,239 --> 01:07:22,442
you guys want,
you want an apology?

1672
01:07:22,476 --> 01:07:24,278
I'll apologize to you.

1673
01:07:24,311 --> 01:07:27,347
I'll look right into
your eyes right now,

1674
01:07:27,381 --> 01:07:29,551
and I am so sorry

1675
01:07:29,584 --> 01:07:31,786
for all the times
that I ever hurt you,

1676
01:07:31,819 --> 01:07:34,321
and all the times that I ever

1677
01:07:34,354 --> 01:07:36,089
made you upset,

1678
01:07:36,123 --> 01:07:37,157
and all the times...

1679
01:07:37,190 --> 01:07:38,660
I'll apologize for him too.

1680
01:07:38,693 --> 01:07:39,561
I hated it when he

1681
01:07:39,594 --> 01:07:41,461
- threatened you.
- Is that what you want?

1682
01:07:41,495 --> 01:07:43,263
For us to tell you we're sorry?

1683
01:07:43,297 --> 01:07:45,867
- Tell him! Apologize to him.
- I mean, okay, I'm sorry

1684
01:07:45,900 --> 01:07:47,267
if I hurt you.

1685
01:07:47,301 --> 01:07:48,068
I'm sorry.

1686
01:07:48,101 --> 01:07:49,771
But say it,
say it like you mean it.

1687
01:07:49,804 --> 01:07:52,707
I am sorry if I hurt you.

1688
01:07:56,744 --> 01:07:58,846
See?

1689
01:07:58,880 --> 01:08:01,716
He is sorry.

1690
01:08:01,749 --> 01:08:03,450
This is a good man,

1691
01:08:03,483 --> 01:08:05,385
and he loves you.

1692
01:08:09,389 --> 01:08:10,825
You doin' okay, Dad?

1693
01:08:15,462 --> 01:08:16,831
I'm sorry.

1694
01:08:18,465 --> 01:08:22,302
Dad, Dad, look at me.

1695
01:08:22,336 --> 01:08:25,138
How many pills are you at?

1696
01:08:25,172 --> 01:08:26,507
How many?

1697
01:08:30,612 --> 01:08:33,881
I don't know!

1698
01:08:33,915 --> 01:08:35,550
I don't know.

1699
01:08:35,583 --> 01:08:36,718
Dad.

1700
01:08:38,653 --> 01:08:40,755
I don't know!

1701
01:08:40,788 --> 01:08:44,191
I take 'em, I take 'em,
I just, it doesn't...

1702
01:08:44,224 --> 01:08:46,393
I take 'em as needed!

1703
01:08:46,426 --> 01:08:48,428
And I need a lot.

1704
01:08:48,462 --> 01:08:50,565
I need a lot.

1705
01:08:55,202 --> 01:08:56,671
Will you go to rehab?

1706
01:09:04,512 --> 01:09:06,814
Okay.

1707
01:09:06,848 --> 01:09:08,816
Yeah?

1708
01:09:08,850 --> 01:09:11,451
Yeah.

1709
01:09:11,485 --> 01:09:14,354
I'll go to the meetings,
I'll do whatever I can.

1710
01:09:14,388 --> 01:09:15,389
I'll do anything!

1711
01:09:15,422 --> 01:09:17,592
I'm gonna throw these
freakin' pills away.

1712
01:09:17,625 --> 01:09:19,594
Here! Take 'em,

1713
01:09:19,627 --> 01:09:21,896
and flush 'em away.

1714
01:09:21,929 --> 01:09:24,364
This is it, this is
day one... day zero.

1715
01:09:24,398 --> 01:09:26,868
Tomorrow's day one.

1716
01:09:26,901 --> 01:09:29,604
Dad.

1717
01:09:29,637 --> 01:09:32,239
If you mean it,

1718
01:09:32,272 --> 01:09:34,307
it would really
mean a lot to me.

1719
01:09:34,341 --> 01:09:37,512
(♪♪♪)

1720
01:09:37,545 --> 01:09:38,880
I mean it!

1721
01:09:38,913 --> 01:09:41,516
(♪♪♪)

1722
