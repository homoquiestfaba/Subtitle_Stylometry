00:00:04,046 --> 00:00:06,632
<i>Crashed in the south pacific.</i>

2
00:00:06,798 --> 00:00:09,343
<i>48 people survived...</i>

3
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:11,803
we're all in this together, man.

4
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:15,349
<i>On a mysterious island...</i>

5
00:00:15,516 --> 00:00:17,726
<i>jack!
Far from home.</i>

6
00:00:17,893 --> 00:00:19,394
You think they would've come by
now. They don't know where to look.

7
00:00:19,561 --> 00:00:22,523
<i>They fought for survival.
This is our island.</i>

8
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:24,525
<i>And after 108 days...</i>

9
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:26,401
i'm one of the survivors
of flight 815.

10
00:00:26,568 --> 00:00:29,696
<i>Six people...
so we can go off the island?</i>

11
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:31,198
<i>Found rescue.</i>

12
00:00:31,365 --> 00:00:33,867
Ladies and gentlemen-
The oceanic six.

13
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:36,745
<i>But the friends
they left behind...</i>

14
00:00:36,912 --> 00:00:38,789
<i>vanished.</i>

15
00:00:38,956 --> 00:00:40,707
<i>Now...</i>

16
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:43,126
jin!

17
00:00:43,293 --> 00:00:45,045
<i>No!
Destiny calls.</i>

18
00:00:45,212 --> 00:00:47,589
Some very bad things happened.
He wants us to come back.

19
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:50,968
<i>And the six who came home</i>

20
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:53,136
<i>Must find a way...
we have to go back!</i>

21
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:56,640
<i>To return. The island needs
you. You have to go back.</i>

22
00:00:56,807 --> 00:01:01,228
Captioned by
closed captioning services, inc.

23
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:05,065
<i>The story of the survivors</i>

24
00:01:05,232 --> 00:01:07,067
<i>Of oceanic flight 815</i>

25
00:01:07,234 --> 00:01:09,903
<i>Has captured the imagination
of audiences around the globe.</i>

26
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:13,073
<i>And tonight, we explore
the many reasons why.</i>

27
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,992
I think for us
as storytellers,

28
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:17,160
What's really exciting
about the show is,

29
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:19,746
When the audience is watching
it, they have this effect of,

30
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:21,915
"What's gonna happen next
on the show?

31
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:24,877
What are they gonna do?
How are they gonna surprise us?"

32
00:01:25,043 --> 00:01:27,129
Well, you can watch
"lost" and you can enjoy it.

33
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:29,089
You realize
there's a bunch of people

34
00:01:29,256 --> 00:01:31,258
That crashed on an island.

35
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:33,427
They're trying to survive
and make lives for themselves.

36
00:01:33,594 --> 00:01:35,429
There's kind of
an elemental quality to it.

37
00:01:35,596 --> 00:01:37,681
Ultimately, anybody could
crash on an island like this,

38
00:01:37,848 --> 00:01:39,725
And the idea of being
surrounded by strangers

39
00:01:39,892 --> 00:01:41,685
And getting to
reinvent yourself in some way

40
00:01:41,852 --> 00:01:43,812
Is sort of
readily identifiable.

41
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:45,606
I don't know your name.

42
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:46,773
I'm kate.

43
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:51,361
Jack.

44
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:54,114
Did anybody see that?
Yeah.

45
00:01:54,281 --> 00:01:59,036
E island is a mysterious
place. It is its own world.

46
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:03,290
It's a polar bear. We don't
know where this island is.

47
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:07,544
We don't know how it is that they
can't be found. Hey! We've got a bar!

48
00:02:07,711 --> 00:02:10,297
<i>Iteration 7-2-9...
what is that?</i>

49
00:02:10,464 --> 00:02:13,258
<i>It's a distress call.</i>

50
00:02:13,425 --> 00:02:16,261
It's been playing
over and over for 16 years.

51
00:02:16,428 --> 00:02:18,222
Maybe they came for them.

52
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:20,641
If someone came,
why's it still playing?

53
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:23,310
The island clearly has a larger
sort of spiritual quality to it.

54
00:02:23,477 --> 00:02:25,312
<i>We have
a mysterious smoke monster...</i>

55
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:27,523
that comes and goes.
Yeah, i saw it.

56
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:30,817
You might see someone
from your past that is dead.

57
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:33,654
Jack has seen his father
on t island...

58
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:37,157
dad? Christian shephard,
who died in australia.

59
00:02:37,324 --> 00:02:40,452
That's him. The reappearance
of dead characters on the show

60
00:02:40,619 --> 00:02:42,454
Kind of provide guidance
for our characters.

61
00:02:42,621 --> 00:02:45,666
I'm not making any sense, am i? No.

62
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:49,002
That's probably because
i've been dead for 12 years.

63
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:51,839
All these characters are
sort of seeking redemption...

64
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:54,633
you're not here!
For misdeeds of their past.

65
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,344
I'm chasing something.
You see him?

66
00:02:57,511 --> 00:03:00,097
Yes. But he's not there.

67
00:03:00,264 --> 00:03:02,808
Last wk,
most of us were strangers,

68
00:03:02,975 --> 00:03:05,477
But we're all here now,

69
00:03:05,644 --> 00:03:08,355
<i>And god knows
how long we're gonna be here.</i>

70
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:10,691
Jack shephard is our hero.
He's a doctor.

71
00:03:10,858 --> 00:03:12,985
He's kind of the guy
who most of the other castaways

72
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:15,195
Have been looking to
to kind of give them

73
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:16,780
Leadership and guidance.

74
00:03:16,947 --> 00:03:20,492
If we can't live together,
we're gonna die alone.

75
00:03:20,659 --> 00:03:22,786
He's not really
comfortable in this role.

76
00:03:22,953 --> 00:03:25,789
I'm not a leader. And yet,
they all treat you like one.

77
00:03:25,956 --> 00:03:28,333
He grew up with
th sort of tyrannical dad.

78
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,711
What'd i do wrong? Let's
hear it. You might wanna try

79
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:33,088
Handg out some hope
every once in a while.

80
00:03:33,255 --> 00:03:35,382
And as a result,

81
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:37,384
Sort of second-Guesses
himself often.

82
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:39,595
You did a good thing.
You're taking care of everybody

83
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:41,889
And just giving us
something to count on.

84
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:44,725
The people on this island have
a second chance at their lives.

85
00:03:44,892 --> 00:03:46,852
You could strip away
every aspect of your life.

86
00:03:47,019 --> 00:03:48,979
If you're a lawyer
or you're a doctor,

87
00:03:49,146 --> 00:03:51,231
Whatever you do
in the real world

88
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:54,568
Doesn't matter anymore on a desert
island. I wanna tell you what i did.

89
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:56,153
I don't want to know.

90
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,405
It doesn't matter, kate.

91
00:03:58,572 --> 00:04:01,033
We should all be able
to start over.

92
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,076
Kate was a fugitive

93
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:06,496
Who was apprehended in australia
by a u.S. Marshal.

94
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:08,499
Don't run, kate.

95
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:11,460
So in terms of a character

96
00:04:11,627 --> 00:04:14,213
<i>Who really got a chance
to start a life over,</i>

97
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:17,966
It would be hard to top kate in that
department. Is kate one of those fugitives

98
00:04:18,133 --> 00:04:20,928
Where she was framed for a crime
she didn't commit?

99
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:23,889
Katherine, what did you do?
I took care of you, mom.

100
00:04:24,056 --> 00:04:27,392
No. She actually blew up her dad... oh.

101
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:30,437
In a giant fireball.
So there you go.

102
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:33,482
Why do you wanna go back, kate?
If you think there's anything

103
00:04:33,649 --> 00:04:36,193
Waiting for you back home
other than handcuffs,

104
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:39,196
Then you really don't know how
the world works. She is a person

105
00:04:39,363 --> 00:04:41,823
Who's used to running from problems
in her life. I'm going back to e beach.

106
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:44,826
<i>What, you're leavin'? It's
very hard for her to not revert</i>

107
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:47,788
To being the person
that she was and just flee.

108
00:04:47,955 --> 00:04:49,790
In about a week,
you'll find some reason

109
00:04:49,957 --> 00:04:53,168
To get pissed at jack
and bounce right back to me.

110
00:04:53,335 --> 00:04:57,214
She finds herself torn
between jack, our doctor,

111
00:04:57,381 --> 00:04:59,466
And sawyer,
who's kind of the bad boy.

112
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:01,510
Why are you sticking up
for sawyer?

113
00:05:01,677 --> 00:05:04,012
He'd never do it for you.
Because i love you.

114
00:05:04,179 --> 00:05:06,849
Jack is the guy
that she should be with,

115
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:08,809
And she does
genuinely love him

116
00:05:08,976 --> 00:05:10,936
And she knows that he would
take excellent care of her,

117
00:05:11,103 --> 00:05:13,939
But sawyer is the guy
that she's really drawn to.

118
00:05:14,106 --> 00:05:17,401
Did you tell him about you
and me? No, but he knows.

119
00:05:17,568 --> 00:05:19,528
He saw us on one of those
surveillance monitors.

120
00:05:19,695 --> 00:05:22,364
Well, now that
that's out of the way,

121
00:05:22,531 --> 00:05:24,908
How about a little
afternoon delight?

122
00:05:25,075 --> 00:05:27,202
Come on, freckles, wait!

123
00:05:27,369 --> 00:05:30,914
You need me to make you a mix
tape? Yeah, why don't you do that?

124
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:34,418
Back in a flash, gorgeous.

125
00:05:34,585 --> 00:05:37,379
Sawyer was a con man
before he got on flight 815.

126
00:05:37,546 --> 00:05:39,423
Are you trying to con me?

127
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:42,134
And he's a con man on the island, too.
Yeah, he's a con man on the island.

128
00:05:42,301 --> 00:05:44,761
There's a new sheriff in town,
boys!

129
00:05:44,928 --> 00:05:47,014
Yeah.
And he's a rogue, a scalawag.

130
00:05:47,181 --> 00:05:50,392
He's dangerous yet handsome yet charming.
He likes beer. He's like han solo.

131
00:05:50,559 --> 00:05:53,520
He makes a lot of funny jokes. He calls people
nicknames. He has nicknames for everybody.

132
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:55,063
Hey there, sunshine.

133
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:57,858
What's your problem, jumbo tron?
Here comes dr. Giggles.

134
00:05:58,025 --> 00:05:59,902
Who are you getting your orders from,
colonel kurtz? He'd call you stripy...

135
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:01,904
'cause of that shirt
you're wearing.

136
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,864
He'd call you necktie.
Nice.

137
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:07,034
You do this back home, too?
Steal from the dead?

138
00:06:07,201 --> 00:06:09,953
You're just not lookin'
at the big picture, doc.

139
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,372
You're still back in
civilization. And where are you?

140
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:14,833
I'm in the wild.
They're basically stuck here

141
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,920
And then they begin
to explore the island...

142
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:20,547
over here. And they discover that
there's some other mysterious people

143
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:23,550
Who live on this island. Have you
seen other people on this island?

144
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:25,385
No, but i hear them...

145
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:27,888
<i>out there, in the jungle.</i>

146
00:06:28,055 --> 00:06:29,431
Sayid!

147
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:31,558
Listen to me.

148
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:33,810
'Re not alone.

149
00:06:33,977 --> 00:06:35,771
The show has
sort of a reputation

150
00:06:35,938 --> 00:06:38,398
For being crazy and wacky
and weird and strange.

151
00:06:38,565 --> 00:06:42,444
But 90% of our day is talking
about the people on the show-

152
00:06:42,611 --> 00:06:44,947
What they would do,
how they would feel,

153
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:47,407
Who's fighting with who,
who has a crush on who-

154
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:50,285
And that's the part of it
that's really fulfilling for us.

155
00:06:50,452 --> 00:06:53,080
I think that the reason
people like these characters

156
00:06:53,247 --> 00:06:56,834
Is they e themselves in them. The show
is about the same things that life is.

157
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,086
It's about love.
It's about forgiveness.

158
00:06:59,253 --> 00:07:02,589
It's about redemption.
It's about pain.

159
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:05,843
It's about excitement. The idea
that they have a chan at redemption

160
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:08,428
Because of where they are
on this mysterious island,

161
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:11,557
That allows us to tell,
i think,

162
00:07:11,723 --> 00:07:14,935
Fairly universal stories
about the human condition.

163
00:07:15,102 --> 00:07:19,523
¶

164
00:07:20,107 --> 00:07:22,150
<i>When john locke
arrived on the island,</i>

165
00:07:22,317 --> 00:07:24,862
<i>He finally found the place
where he truly belonged.</i>

166
00:07:25,028 --> 00:07:27,489
Mallomars.
Wake up, hugo.

167
00:07:27,656 --> 00:07:29,950
Huh? Time to get up.
We're gonna get going.

168
00:07:30,117 --> 00:07:33,328
I thought we didn't know where
we were going, dude. We do now.

169
00:07:33,495 --> 00:07:35,873
I run a school for kids

170
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:38,709
Who are extremely special,

171
00:07:38,876 --> 00:07:41,795
And i have reason to believe
that you might be one of them.

172
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:44,298
John locke's entire life
has been people telling him

173
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,800
That he is special,
that he's meant for something.

174
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:49,469
But all that ever got him
was in a wheelchair,

175
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:53,515
In a dead-End job in a cubical.
He was a guy who was really

176
00:07:53,682 --> 00:07:56,643
At sort of the low nadir
in his life.

177
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:59,563
Aah! Aah! You survived falling
eight stories out of a building.

178
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:02,649
That's a miracle, mr. Locke.
Do you believe in miracles

179
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:07,237
Nope, i don't believe
in miracles.

180
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:12,701
When he landed on this island,
he discovered he could walk.

181
00:08:12,868 --> 00:08:15,454
You, come on! Get over here
and give me a hand!

182
00:08:15,621 --> 00:08:17,706
Suddenly,
he's walking around,

183
00:08:17,873 --> 00:08:19,917
And he's like, "this is what
everybody was talking about.

184
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:22,586
This is what i was meant for.
This is what makes me special."

185
00:08:22,753 --> 00:08:25,714
What if everything
that happened here,

186
00:08:25,881 --> 00:08:27,424
Happened for a reason?

187
00:08:27,591 --> 00:08:29,384
Locke basically believes,
"who needs science?"

188
00:08:29,551 --> 00:08:31,929
You know, "who needs
a scientific explanation?"

189
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:33,472
It's destiny.

190
00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:35,349
I don't believe in destiny.

191
00:08:35,516 --> 00:08:37,684
Yes, you do.
You just don't know it yet.

192
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:39,686
The island is kind of like

193
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:41,688
The worst a.A. Meeting
you could possibly imagine,

194
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:45,192
'Cause it forces you to relive
your past over and over again.

195
00:08:45,359 --> 00:08:47,194
So if you were a torturer,

196
00:08:47,361 --> 00:08:49,905
The island is gonna
present a situation for you

197
00:08:50,072 --> 00:08:52,074
Where you get to choose
whether or not

198
00:08:52,241 --> 00:08:53,951
You're gonna torture again. I served
five years in the republican guard.

199
00:08:54,117 --> 00:08:56,328
Just give me
ten minutes with him.

200
00:08:56,495 --> 00:08:57,871
¶

201
00:08:58,038 --> 00:09:00,833
Sayid was a guy who has
tried on many occasions

202
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:02,876
To shed this very dark
sort of soul

203
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:04,962
That he has inside
of himself.

204
00:09:05,128 --> 00:09:08,465
Guess you're lucky you have
a new skill set you can use.

205
00:09:08,632 --> 00:09:11,635
He is carrying the burden
of having tortured people,

206
00:09:11,802 --> 00:09:13,887
And that is
a very heavy burden for him.

207
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:15,556
This isn't a game, nadia.

208
00:09:15,722 --> 00:09:17,599
Yet you keep playing it,
sayid,

209
00:09:17,766 --> 00:09:20,686
Pretending to be something
i know you're not.

210
00:09:20,853 --> 00:09:23,105
He escaped
his existence in iraq

211
00:09:23,272 --> 00:09:25,399
And was on a quest to find,
uh, this woman nadia

212
00:09:25,566 --> 00:09:28,026
Who he lost track of.

213
00:09:28,193 --> 00:09:30,195
I've been holding on
for the past seven years

214
00:09:30,362 --> 00:09:32,239
To just a thought,

215
00:09:32,406 --> 00:09:35,200
A blind hope, that somewhere
she is still alive.

216
00:09:35,367 --> 00:09:38,453
Is he capable of transcending
the bad guy that he once was?

217
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:40,622
That's what makes him really
compelling as a character.

218
00:09:40,789 --> 00:09:43,083
I'm willing to give my life
if it means securing rescue.

219
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,127
I'm not giving it up
for nothing.

220
00:09:45,294 --> 00:09:46,628
That idea of redemption

221
00:09:46,795 --> 00:09:49,756
Is really sort of the central
thematic of the show.

222
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:51,758
He's gonna be all right.

223
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:56,680
Jack's gonna be all right. We
all are. Well, what a relief.

224
00:09:56,847 --> 00:09:59,766
In a lot of ways,
hurley, i think,

225
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:02,102
Is kind of the heart
and the soul of the show.

226
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:04,605
I mean, he's this guy who's
just trying to get along

227
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:06,148
And make his way here.

228
00:10:06,315 --> 00:10:08,275
And hurley, we discovered
in the first season,

229
00:10:08,442 --> 00:10:10,444
Won the lottery.

230
00:10:10,611 --> 00:10:13,322
But this money made him utterly miserable.
I've kind of had some bad luck, too.

231
00:10:13,488 --> 00:10:15,949
Grandpa tito
died of a heart attack,

232
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:18,619
And the first house
i bought my mom burnt down.

233
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:21,163
Going to australia's
not gonna break any curse.

234
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:23,582
You need a little hope.

235
00:10:23,749 --> 00:10:25,417
I have hope.

236
00:10:25,584 --> 00:10:28,086
There is a dharma bus
on the island.

237
00:10:28,253 --> 00:10:30,964
He decides that
getting this car running

238
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:35,552
Will really be a manifestation
of the possibility of hope.

239
00:10:35,719 --> 00:10:37,554
Go!
Aah!

240
00:10:37,721 --> 00:10:39,306
Son of a bitch.

241
00:10:39,473 --> 00:10:41,725
The van
actually represents

242
00:10:41,892 --> 00:10:44,228
A little more than just that

243
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:47,314
Because hurley finds a dead
body in the van. Bottoms up.

244
00:10:47,481 --> 00:10:50,192
That's not cool, dude. That guy
had a mom... oh, and a name.

245
00:10:50,359 --> 00:10:51,985
Not skeletor-
It's roger workman.

246
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:54,780
<i>It's work man,
you blockhead!</i>

247
00:10:54,947 --> 00:10:56,156
He was a dharma janitor.

248
00:10:56,323 --> 00:10:58,075
<i>I'm a janitor?</i>

249
00:10:58,242 --> 00:11:01,995
I'm sorry, mr. Linus.

250
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:04,998
Now the dharma
initiative was on the island

251
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:07,751
Back in the '70s, early 80s.

252
00:11:07,918 --> 00:11:10,838
<i>I'm dr. Edgar halliwax.
This is the orientation film...</i>

253
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:12,756
what brought
the dharma initiative

254
00:11:12,923 --> 00:11:14,466
To the island,

255
00:11:14,633 --> 00:11:16,885
It depends on whether or not you
believe these orientation films

256
00:11:17,052 --> 00:11:19,429
<i>That our characters keep finding.
For the briefest of the moments,</i>

257
00:11:19,596 --> 00:11:21,890
<i>The animal
will seem to disappear.</i>

258
00:11:22,057 --> 00:11:25,394
All we really know about dharma
is what we see in the films.

259
00:11:25,561 --> 00:11:27,729
The dharma initiative says
that they came to the island

260
00:11:27,896 --> 00:11:29,857
To kind of make the world
a better place.

261
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:32,359
But when you look a little
closer at these hatches...

262
00:11:32,526 --> 00:11:34,611
it feels like they were
into psychological experiments.

263
00:11:34,778 --> 00:11:37,030
Every one of these hatches
is loaded with guns,

264
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:38,991
So they seemed to have been

265
00:11:39,157 --> 00:11:41,577
A little bit more militaristic
than we originally surmised.

266
00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:44,872
They set up their own
utopian society and they were

267
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:46,957
Trying to carry out
these various experiments.

268
00:11:47,124 --> 00:11:49,877
But then they discovered, oh,
there's these indigenous people

269
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:51,879
On the island called
the others, or the hostiles.

270
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:55,174
<i>Okay, everyone into your
positions. The so-Called hostiles</i>

271
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:57,885
<i>Lived on the island long before
the dharma initiative.</i>

272
00:11:58,051 --> 00:12:00,095
<i>And while they were
wary of outsiders,</i>

273
00:12:00,262 --> 00:12:02,723
<i>They did make a few
exceptions. Are you one of them?</i>

274
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:05,934
One of who?
A hostile.

275
00:12:06,101 --> 00:12:08,187
Do you even know
what that word means?

276
00:12:08,353 --> 00:12:09,980
Benjamin linus has

277
00:12:10,147 --> 00:12:13,108
A very sort of troubled history
with the island.

278
00:12:13,275 --> 00:12:17,196
Hey! Welcome to the island, man!
Namaste. And this must be ben. Yeah.

279
00:12:17,362 --> 00:12:19,364
He was a member
of the dharma initiative.

280
00:12:19,531 --> 00:12:22,201
He lived amongst these people
with his father.

281
00:12:22,367 --> 00:12:24,661
Happy birthday, ben.
Sorry i forgot.

282
00:12:24,828 --> 00:12:28,040
It's kind of hard to celebrate
on the day you killed your mom.

283
00:12:28,207 --> 00:12:30,542
Aah!

284
00:12:30,709 --> 00:12:33,128
You had to come early.
Now she's gone,

285
00:12:33,295 --> 00:12:36,423
<i>And i'm stuck here
on this island... with you.</i>

286
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:38,008
And that led him

287
00:12:38,175 --> 00:12:40,511
To become a fairly dark
and twisted individual...

288
00:12:40,677 --> 00:12:42,554
good-Bye, dad. Someone
dark and twisted enough

289
00:12:42,721 --> 00:12:47,100
To basically kill his own father
in cold blood.

290
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:50,187
Ben is, in fact, complicit in
or potentially responsible

291
00:12:50,354 --> 00:12:52,147
For the genocide
of all these people.

292
00:12:52,314 --> 00:12:54,149
He killed
the dharma initiative.

293
00:12:54,316 --> 00:12:57,945
<i>Ben emerged from this incident
as the leader of the others.</i>

294
00:12:58,111 --> 00:13:00,781
You want us to, um,
go get his body?

295
00:13:00,948 --> 00:13:03,825
No. Leave him out there.

296
00:13:03,992 --> 00:13:08,080
<i>And when oceanic 815
crashed on the island...</i>

297
00:13:08,247 --> 00:13:10,082
<i>everything for ben
was about to change,</i>

298
00:13:10,249 --> 00:13:14,294
<i>Though he did everything
he could to maintain his power.</i>

299
00:13:14,461 --> 00:13:16,964
Goodwin! If you run, you can
make that shore in an hour.

300
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:19,341
Ethan, get up there
to that fuselage.

301
00:13:19,508 --> 00:13:21,468
There may actually
be survivors.

302
00:13:21,635 --> 00:13:26,056
<i>Listen, learn,
don't get involved. Go!</i>

303
00:13:27,933 --> 00:13:30,143
Whenever somebody else
comes to the island,

304
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:32,145
The others essentially,
sort of like hermit crabs,

305
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:34,439
Wipe them out
and start to use their stuff.

306
00:13:34,606 --> 00:13:36,483
So they have access
to satellites,

307
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:39,778
And they live in houses and have
little book club meetings

308
00:13:39,945 --> 00:13:42,197
And this submarine that
used to go between the island

309
00:13:42,364 --> 00:13:44,157
And back to the real world,

310
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:47,202
So they're able to sort of leave
the island at their own will.

311
00:13:47,369 --> 00:13:49,496
And they're very unhappy about
the fact that these survivors

312
00:13:49,663 --> 00:13:50,998
Landed on their island.

313
00:13:51,165 --> 00:13:53,208
There's an uneasy truce
that exists for a while.

314
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:57,045
<i>This is our island, and the only
reason you're living on it</i>

315
00:13:57,212 --> 00:13:59,256
<i>Is 'cause we let you
live on it.</i>

316
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:01,675
But there's also
hostility and conflict.

317
00:14:01,842 --> 00:14:04,595
Aah! Ben is a bad guy,
and ben has basically

318
00:14:04,761 --> 00:14:07,514
Done a lot of horrible things
to further his own power.

319
00:14:07,681 --> 00:14:11,268
You ever wonder what happened
to the dharma initiative, hugo?

320
00:14:11,435 --> 00:14:13,103
Whoa.

321
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:16,023
There must have been
at least a hundred of 'em

322
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:18,901
Living on this island.
What happened to 'em?

323
00:14:19,067 --> 00:14:23,488
<i>He did.</i>

324
00:14:23,947 --> 00:14:26,783
E we're taking you to
is special. Special, huh?

325
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:30,162
You'll see things there
that you never imagined.

326
00:14:30,329 --> 00:14:32,998
<i>And one can only wonder
where it all began.</i>

327
00:14:33,165 --> 00:14:35,167
We know that the island's
been around for a long time

328
00:14:35,334 --> 00:14:37,794
Because occasionally
we will stumble upon

329
00:14:37,961 --> 00:14:41,131
The people who were here before.
Our very own adam and eve.

330
00:14:41,298 --> 00:14:43,675
We find a ship
in the middle of the jungle.

331
00:14:43,842 --> 00:14:45,802
How it got there,
we don't know, but we know

332
00:14:45,969 --> 00:14:49,056
That it's from the 19th century.
We saw this foot of a giant statue

333
00:14:49,223 --> 00:14:51,725
That was by the water
on part of the island.

334
00:14:51,892 --> 00:14:55,437
It has four toes. So the idea
that there have been people

335
00:14:55,604 --> 00:14:57,272
Coming to this island
for many, many years-

336
00:14:57,439 --> 00:15:01,735
Why has the island been drawing
people to it all this time? We're here.

337
00:15:01,902 --> 00:15:05,572
Juliet's a doctor
who lived in miami,

338
00:15:05,739 --> 00:15:07,824
And she got recruited
by the others.

339
00:15:07,991 --> 00:15:10,369
She thought
she was going to work

340
00:15:10,536 --> 00:15:12,371
For a pharmaceutical company
in portland, oregon,

341
00:15:12,538 --> 00:15:15,415
But in fact, she woke up on the
island. My name is benjamin linus.

342
00:15:15,582 --> 00:15:18,085
I'm really looking forward
to working with you.

343
00:15:18,252 --> 00:15:20,087
Juliet was recruited
by the others

344
00:15:20,254 --> 00:15:22,589
Because she was
a fertility expert...

345
00:15:22,756 --> 00:15:24,591
and one of the problems
that the others were having

346
00:15:24,758 --> 00:15:26,593
Is that they couldn't
have kids on this island.

347
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,679
I think it happens
at conception.

348
00:15:28,846 --> 00:15:30,931
There's nothing i can do about it, at
least not here. Juliet, at a certain point,

349
00:15:31,098 --> 00:15:33,559
Really becomes aware
that ben is manipulating her,

350
00:15:33,725 --> 00:15:36,270
And all she wants is to to get off
this is. That's not our agreement.

351
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:39,606
You need to stay here
until your work is finished.

352
00:15:39,773 --> 00:15:41,608
It's impossible!
The thers keep dying.

353
00:15:41,775 --> 00:15:44,820
<i>So juliet left the others
to join the survivors,</i>

354
00:15:44,987 --> 00:15:46,947
<i>Seeing them
as her best chance to get home.</i>

355
00:15:47,114 --> 00:15:49,408
You want
to get off this island

356
00:15:49,575 --> 00:15:52,286
More than anything else
in the world.

357
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:54,830
It makes you one of us.

358
00:15:54,997 --> 00:15:57,624
I want to know
about your research.

359
00:15:57,791 --> 00:16:00,335
Sun... what happens to pregnant women?

360
00:16:00,502 --> 00:16:03,380
They all die.

361
00:16:03,547 --> 00:16:05,507
Sun and jin are
from korea. They're married.

362
00:16:05,674 --> 00:16:08,969
And when we first meet them,
we assume that jin

363
00:16:09,136 --> 00:16:10,888
Is this sort of
domineering husband,

364
00:16:11,054 --> 00:16:12,806
And she is
the submissive wife.

365
00:16:12,973 --> 00:16:15,601
But as time goes by, we realize
that sun was having an affair.

366
00:16:15,767 --> 00:16:19,396
She's pregnant, and she doesn't
know, uh, if the baby is

367
00:16:19,563 --> 00:16:22,149
Her husband's or this guy that
she was having the affair with.

368
00:16:22,316 --> 00:16:25,194
The baby was conceived
about eight weeks ago.

369
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,279
You got pregnant
on the island.

370
00:16:27,446 --> 00:16:30,699
It's jin's.

371
00:16:30,866 --> 00:16:33,243
She comes to find out
that it was jin's,

372
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:38,499
And she eventually comes clean.
She tells him everything.

373
00:16:46,298 --> 00:16:48,217
<i>While many wanted
to leave the island,</i>

374
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:50,969
<i>One survivor
had reason to stay.</i>

375
00:16:51,136 --> 00:16:54,348
Don't mind them. They're all
just excited you're here.

376
00:16:54,515 --> 00:16:55,474
Excited?

377
00:16:55,641 --> 00:16:57,518
We've been waiting for you.

378
00:16:57,684 --> 00:17:00,938
Locke is really now on
a mission to try to understand

379
00:17:01,104 --> 00:17:04,233
The mysteries of this island.
It's beautiful, isn't it?

380
00:17:04,399 --> 00:17:06,193
No matter how much time
you spend on the island,

381
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:08,362
You just never
get tired of this view.

382
00:17:08,529 --> 00:17:10,822
We haven't been formerly
introduced. I'm richard.

383
00:17:10,989 --> 00:17:14,576
Richard alpert is
the guy behind the guy.

384
00:17:14,743 --> 00:17:17,287
He is an other,
a very mysterious figure,

385
00:17:17,454 --> 00:17:19,665
And we have seen him
in sort of an advisory role.

386
00:17:19,832 --> 00:17:21,166
There's 40 of them.

387
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:23,710
What do you think's gonna happen
when you get there?

388
00:17:23,877 --> 00:17:26,255
We saw him visit john locke
when he was a very little kid.

389
00:17:26,421 --> 00:17:28,549
The thing about alpert is that
he always looks the same

390
00:17:28,715 --> 00:17:30,968
In all the different time
periods that we've seen him.

391
00:17:31,134 --> 00:17:33,554
When word
had gotten back here

392
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,890
That there was a man with
a broken spine on the plane

393
00:17:37,057 --> 00:17:38,934
Who could suddenly
walk again,

394
00:17:39,101 --> 00:17:41,895
Well, people here began
to get very excited because that

395
00:17:42,062 --> 00:17:44,815
Could only happen to someone
who was extremely special.

396
00:17:44,982 --> 00:17:47,276
John locke seems to be the guy
that the island wants

397
00:17:47,442 --> 00:17:49,528
To be leading. We're looking
for someone to remind us

398
00:17:49,695 --> 00:17:52,114
That we're here
for more important reasons.

399
00:17:52,281 --> 00:17:54,741
But ben doesn't want anyone
to think you're special, john.

400
00:17:54,908 --> 00:17:57,494
Ben is told that locke
is going to be replacing him

401
00:17:57,661 --> 00:18:01,874
As the leader of the island, and ben is not
happy about this. You'll understand soon enough

402
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:04,168
That there are consequences
to being chosen...

403
00:18:04,334 --> 00:18:05,752
because destiny, john,

404
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:09,089
Is a fickle bitch.

405
00:18:09,256 --> 00:18:12,593
<i>With ben now replaced,
locke's mission as leader</i>

406
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:15,596
<i>Was to protect the island at
all costs. Locke has basically</i>

407
00:18:15,762 --> 00:18:18,682
Destroyed two ways
in which our survivors

408
00:18:18,849 --> 00:18:21,185
Might get themselves
liberated from this island.

409
00:18:21,351 --> 00:18:23,937
He blows up
one of the dharma stations

410
00:18:24,104 --> 00:18:25,981
Which is
a communication station,

411
00:18:26,148 --> 00:18:28,775
And then he blows up
the submarine,

412
00:18:28,942 --> 00:18:31,820
Which is their best chance of getting
off the island. I'm sorry. Jack.

413
00:18:31,987 --> 00:18:35,115
<i>Just when it seemed
all hope for rescue was lost,</i>

414
00:18:35,282 --> 00:18:37,451
<i>The survivors learned
a group on a nearby freighter</i>

415
00:18:37,618 --> 00:18:39,411
<i>Were trying
to reach the island.</i>

416
00:18:39,578 --> 00:18:41,997
Is that like a radio?
Yes.

417
00:18:42,164 --> 00:18:44,291
I've never seen equipment
this sophisticated.

418
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:47,127
You can still make it
work, right? I hope so.

419
00:18:47,294 --> 00:18:49,338
<i>With rescue
finally a possibility,</i>

420
00:18:49,505 --> 00:18:52,049
<i>Locke once again tried
to prevent anyone from leaving.</i>

421
00:18:52,216 --> 00:18:54,885
What are you doing, john?

422
00:18:55,052 --> 00:18:57,888
Put the phone down
jack is the optimist.

423
00:18:58,055 --> 00:19:00,307
He goes, "oh, here's our chance.
We're gonna get off the island."

424
00:19:00,474 --> 00:19:03,936
You're done keeping me
on this island.

425
00:19:04,102 --> 00:19:06,146
You're not supposed
to do this.

426
00:19:06,313 --> 00:19:08,524
Minkowski.

427
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:10,067
Hello?

428
00:19:10,234 --> 00:19:11,777
Who is this?

429
00:19:11,944 --> 00:19:17,407
I'm one of the survivors
of oceanic flight 815.

430
00:19:17,574 --> 00:19:19,576
Can you get a fix
on our location?

431
00:19:19,743 --> 00:19:21,245
Hell, yeah, we can!

432
00:19:21,411 --> 00:19:22,621
Sit tight.

433
00:19:22,788 --> 00:19:27,209
We'll be right there.

434
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:35,217
Oh!

435
00:19:35,384 --> 00:19:37,511
You all right, brother?
Ah! I'm fine.

436
00:19:37,678 --> 00:19:39,596
Does this hurt?

437
00:19:39,763 --> 00:19:42,558
You haven't sprained it then. What
do you know about sprains anyway?

438
00:19:42,724 --> 00:19:46,019
I was almost a doctor once.
Small world.

439
00:19:46,186 --> 00:19:47,855
<i>Among the oceanic survivors,</i>

440
00:19:48,021 --> 00:19:50,858
<i>The degrees of separation
are few.</i>

441
00:19:51,024 --> 00:19:52,818
There have been
a lot of connections

442
00:19:52,985 --> 00:19:55,279
Between the characters as time
has gone by, some of which

443
00:19:55,445 --> 00:19:57,364
They're aware of and some
of which they aren't aware of.

444
00:19:57,531 --> 00:19:59,741
But all their paths
have sort of crossed

445
00:19:59,908 --> 00:20:03,078
In these strange and mysterious ways.
I fell in love with the wrong guy.

446
00:20:03,245 --> 00:20:07,207
He conned me and embarrassed me.
He was a bad guy.

447
00:20:07,374 --> 00:20:09,626
Some people are just
supposed to suffer.

448
00:20:09,793 --> 00:20:11,628
That's why the red sox-
Will never win the series.

449
00:20:11,795 --> 00:20:15,090
What the hell is that supposed to
mean? Something my father used to say.

450
00:20:15,257 --> 00:20:17,551
There is this sort of
weave of life in that

451
00:20:17,718 --> 00:20:20,721
These aracters that are
brought together on this island

452
00:20:20,888 --> 00:20:22,764
All are linked
to each other.

453
00:20:22,931 --> 00:20:24,600
I'm desmond.

454
00:20:24,766 --> 00:20:26,018
Jack.

455
00:20:26,185 --> 00:20:28,103
Well, good luck, brother.

456
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:30,814
See you in another life,
yeah?

457
00:20:30,981 --> 00:20:33,192
Desmond shipwrecked
on this island

458
00:20:33,358 --> 00:20:35,194
While he was attempting
to sail around the world

459
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:38,614
To kind of try to prove
his heroism to penny widmore,

460
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:41,241
The woman that he loves.

461
00:20:41,408 --> 00:20:43,410
Desmond,
what are you running from?

462
00:20:43,577 --> 00:20:45,412
I have to get my honor back.

463
00:20:45,579 --> 00:20:47,539
Penny widmore's father,
charles widmore,

464
00:20:47,706 --> 00:20:49,500
Is this very powerful
and imposing figure,

465
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:51,668
And he doesn't
like desmond at all.

466
00:20:51,835 --> 00:20:54,087
And what makes you think
i would just run away?

467
00:20:54,254 --> 00:20:56,048
Because you're a coward.

468
00:20:56,215 --> 00:21:00,302
<i>I'm nna win this race, penny-
His race.</i>

469
00:21:00,469 --> 00:21:02,888
And in a year, i'll be back.

470
00:21:03,055 --> 00:21:05,390
The net result of being
shipwrecked on this island

471
00:21:05,557 --> 00:21:08,560
Was that desmond and penny
have been separated,

472
00:21:08,727 --> 00:21:11,522
And penny was searching
for desmond for a long time.

473
00:21:11,688 --> 00:21:14,399
He spent
a significant amount of time

474
00:21:14,566 --> 00:21:17,945
Down in this hatch pushing this button.
And when the button isn't pushed,

475
00:21:18,111 --> 00:21:19,780
Cataclysmic events started
happening. I've gotta go,

476
00:21:19,947 --> 00:21:22,282
And you've gotta get as far
away from here as possible.

477
00:21:22,449 --> 00:21:25,452
So desmond crawled down
in that underground passage.

478
00:21:25,619 --> 00:21:28,622
And when he turns this
failsafe key, all of a sudden,

479
00:21:28,789 --> 00:21:32,209
There's a white flash and there
was this incredibly weird noise.

480
00:21:32,376 --> 00:21:35,212
Obviously, there was
some consequence of that.

481
00:21:35,379 --> 00:21:37,714
One consequence appears to be
that the island was made visible

482
00:21:37,881 --> 00:21:40,634
To the outside world.

483
00:21:40,801 --> 00:21:43,679
Hello? Miss widmore?
I think we found it.

484
00:21:43,846 --> 00:21:45,848
Des, where are you?!

485
00:21:46,014 --> 00:21:47,766
My god, penny.
Is that really you?

486
00:21:47,933 --> 00:21:49,393
Yes, it's me.

487
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:50,978
I love you, penny.

488
00:21:51,144 --> 00:21:53,230
I've always loved you.

489
00:21:53,397 --> 00:21:55,774
I'll find you, des.
I'll come back to you.

490
00:21:55,941 --> 00:21:57,568
I won't give up.
I promise.

491
00:21:57,734 --> 00:21:59,903
I promise. I love you.
I love you.

492
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:02,114
The power source went dead.

493
00:22:02,281 --> 00:22:03,532
Th's all we have.

494
00:22:03,699 --> 00:22:06,493
For reasons that we don't quite
know, the island is invisible.

495
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:08,537
If you fly over it,
you can't see it.

496
00:22:08,704 --> 00:22:10,664
You know, uh, satellites
can't take pictures of it.

497
00:22:10,831 --> 00:22:12,666
So it's very difficult
to find.

498
00:22:12,833 --> 00:22:16,086
<i>And then, essentially, this
freighter shows up. The freighter</i>

499
00:22:16,253 --> 00:22:19,423
<i>Sent a research team
by helicopter to the island,</i>

500
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:23,760
<i>Where they were discovered
by the survivors.</i>

501
00:22:23,886 --> 00:22:26,597
Who are you?
- I'm here to rescue you.

502
00:22:26,763 --> 00:22:29,099
Jack was hoping
that the freighter people

503
00:22:29,266 --> 00:22:30,517
Really were as promised,

504
00:22:30,684 --> 00:22:32,436
And so he basically
saw the freighter

505
00:22:32,603 --> 00:22:36,356
As a way for our guys to get off
the island. Are we really going home?

506
00:22:36,523 --> 00:22:38,692
Yeah,
we're really going home.

507
00:22:38,859 --> 00:22:40,944
And locke is actually
the pessimist.

508
00:22:41,111 --> 00:22:43,197
He goes, "unh-Unh, these peoe
are gonna kill us.

509
00:22:43,363 --> 00:22:46,325
They're gonna wipe us out." If you
wanna live, you need to come with me.

510
00:22:46,492 --> 00:22:50,913
No one's going anywhere
with you, john.

511
00:22:53,624 --> 00:22:55,042
What are you doing?

512
00:22:55,209 --> 00:22:58,837
Same thing
i've always done, kate.

513
00:22:59,004 --> 00:23:00,339
Survivin'.

514
00:23:00,506 --> 00:23:04,009
You should
go with him, kate.

515
00:23:04,176 --> 00:23:08,597
You serious?
I don't trust locke.

516
00:23:10,307 --> 00:23:13,477
Can you get aaron for me?

517
00:23:13,644 --> 00:23:17,272
Yeah, i'm just...
not very good with babies.

518
00:23:17,439 --> 00:23:19,441
Ohh.

519
00:23:19,608 --> 00:23:21,735
You're so good with him.

520
00:23:21,902 --> 00:23:25,489
The last thing i ever thought
i'd be good at is being a mom.

521
00:23:25,656 --> 00:23:28,575
You know, you should
try it sometime.

522
00:23:28,742 --> 00:23:31,578
Hey!

523
00:23:31,745 --> 00:23:34,706
Claire littleton
was eight months pregnant

524
00:23:34,873 --> 00:23:36,250
When the plane crashed

525
00:23:36,416 --> 00:23:39,419
And shortly thereafter
gave birth to her son aaron.

526
00:23:39,586 --> 00:23:41,630
You have a little boy!
Oh!

527
00:23:41,797 --> 00:23:44,091
In her sort of
younger rebellious days,

528
00:23:44,258 --> 00:23:47,511
She was in this rather bad
car accident,

529
00:23:47,678 --> 00:23:49,930
And claire's mother ended up
in a vegetative state.

530
00:23:50,097 --> 00:23:52,683
As a result of that event,
claire finds out

531
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:55,769
Who her real father is. I came
over because i wanted to help.

532
00:23:55,936 --> 00:23:58,647
And we the audience
realize this man is in fact

533
00:23:58,814 --> 00:24:01,149
Christian shephard, who also
happens to be jack's father.

534
00:24:01,316 --> 00:24:05,279
I don't even know your name.
I want it to stay that way.

535
00:24:05,445 --> 00:24:07,698
And now, essentially,
claire's missing.

536
00:24:07,865 --> 00:24:09,741
We don't know where she is.

537
00:24:09,908 --> 00:24:12,244
She saw christiashephard
in the jungle. Dad?

538
00:24:12,411 --> 00:24:15,122
She left the baby behind,
and that's it.

539
00:24:15,289 --> 00:24:17,207
Where's claire?

540
00:24:17,374 --> 00:24:19,793
We lost her.
You what?

541
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:24,381
She just walked off
in the middle of the night.

542
00:24:27,384 --> 00:24:29,094
Are you okay?

543
00:24:29,261 --> 00:24:31,638
Lapidus, where's the chopper?
Where did it crash?

544
00:24:31,805 --> 00:24:36,727
Crash? I put her down
safe and sound right over there.

545
00:24:36,894 --> 00:24:39,855
<i>The team from the freighter
and their helicopter</i>

546
00:24:40,022 --> 00:24:41,857
<i>Landed safely on the island,</i>

547
00:24:42,024 --> 00:24:43,817
<i>Leaving jack
and his fellow survivors</i>

548
00:24:43,984 --> 00:24:46,111
<i>To believe they were
one step closer to rescue.</i>

549
00:24:46,278 --> 00:24:48,780
There are two types
of people on the freighter.

550
00:24:48,947 --> 00:24:51,241
There's scientists
and then there's military guys.

551
00:24:51,408 --> 00:24:53,160
And the scientists
are sort of represented

552
00:24:53,327 --> 00:24:54,703
By this guy dan faraday,

553
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:56,413
A woman named charlotte lewis

554
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:58,916
And then a guy
named miles straume,

555
00:24:59,082 --> 00:25:01,710
And they come first.
What's this for?

556
00:25:01,877 --> 00:25:03,795
Rescuing you
and your people-

557
00:25:03,962 --> 00:25:06,131
Can't really say
it's our primary objective.

558
00:25:06,298 --> 00:25:08,133
And they're sort of interested
in doing experiments,

559
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:10,511
Figuring things out
about the island.

560
00:25:10,677 --> 00:25:13,514
In the meantime, the military
guys are sort of moving in

561
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,641
With their guns
and their explosives...

562
00:25:15,807 --> 00:25:17,809
and they are trying to get
benjamin linus off the island.

563
00:25:17,976 --> 00:25:20,354
Get your ass out here
right now,

564
00:25:20,521 --> 00:25:23,315
Or i'm gonna kill your daughter.
I'm not coming out of this house.

565
00:25:23,482 --> 00:25:26,360
So if you want to kill her,
go ahead and do it.

566
00:25:26,527 --> 00:25:29,238
And their mission is not
only to take out benjamin linus,

567
00:25:29,404 --> 00:25:32,199
But to take out everybody else
who's on the island.

568
00:25:32,366 --> 00:25:35,035
I can help you, john.
We have shared interests.

569
00:25:35,202 --> 00:25:38,121
Or, at least, a common enemy. And that
would be our friends on the freighter.

570
00:25:38,288 --> 00:25:42,709
Not them.
The one they work for.

571
00:25:42,918 --> 00:25:44,503
This is charles widmore,

572
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:47,089
The man whose boat
is parked offshore.

573
00:25:47,256 --> 00:25:48,882
What does he want?

574
00:25:49,049 --> 00:25:51,051
Charles widmore
wants to exploit this island,

575
00:25:51,218 --> 00:25:54,012
<i>And he'll do everything
in his power to possess it.</i>

576
00:25:54,179 --> 00:25:56,139
This guy charles widmore
looms out there,

577
00:25:56,306 --> 00:25:58,684
And what exactly
his relationship is

578
00:25:58,851 --> 00:26:01,186
With this island,
we don't know.

579
00:26:01,353 --> 00:26:03,856
We know that he has
a daughter named penny,

580
00:26:04,022 --> 00:26:05,941
The long-Lost love
of our character desmond.

581
00:26:06,108 --> 00:26:09,903
<i>The wreckage of oceanic flight 815 has
been found. There is this sort of wrinkle.</i>

582
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:12,239
Oceanic 815
supposedly was disvered

583
00:26:12,406 --> 00:26:14,283
On the bottom of the ocean,
and everybody aboard was dead,

584
00:26:14,449 --> 00:26:16,451
Which is not the truth

585
00:26:16,618 --> 00:26:18,328
Because their plane
crashed on the island.

586
00:26:18,495 --> 00:26:20,205
Wow, who could possibly
be responsible

587
00:26:20,372 --> 00:26:22,666
For staging a conspiracy of this
magnitude? Ben basically says

588
00:26:22,833 --> 00:26:24,918
It was widmore.
"He wanted everyone to think

589
00:26:25,085 --> 00:26:27,754
"You guys were dead so no one
would ever find the island

590
00:26:27,921 --> 00:26:30,924
And he could find it
for his own purposes."

591
00:26:31,091 --> 00:26:33,802
And widmore says,
"benjamin linus is responsible

592
00:26:33,969 --> 00:26:37,806
For putting the plane there, for exactly
the same reasons." I know who youre, boy.

593
00:26:37,973 --> 00:26:40,267
Everything you have, you took
from me. I'm here, charles,

594
00:26:40,434 --> 00:26:43,729
<i>To tell you that i'm going
to kill your daughter.</i>

595
00:26:43,896 --> 00:26:45,689
You'll never find her.

596
00:26:45,856 --> 00:26:48,567
That island's mine, benjamin.

597
00:26:48,734 --> 00:26:53,030
It always was. It will be again.
This scenario is really bad

598
00:26:53,197 --> 00:26:55,115
Because this freighter
has found the island,

599
00:26:55,282 --> 00:26:57,993
And the others have been trying
to protect the island

600
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:00,662
All this time.
Locke has basically been told

601
00:27:00,829 --> 00:27:02,998
That he is now the chief
of the others. Welcome home.

602
00:27:03,165 --> 00:27:04,875
He's finally,
after all this time,

603
00:27:05,042 --> 00:27:06,877
Ascended to
a leadership position.

604
00:27:07,044 --> 00:27:09,713
So the fact that widmore
now knows where the island is

605
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:12,174
Creates this problem for them,
which is, even if they're able

606
00:27:12,341 --> 00:27:14,134
To get rid of the people
on the boat,

607
00:27:14,301 --> 00:27:15,844
They still have to make sure

608
00:27:16,011 --> 00:27:19,389
<i>That the island can't be found
again. Locke and ben were determined</i>

609
00:27:19,556 --> 00:27:21,517
<i>To secure the safety
of the island,</i>

610
00:27:21,683 --> 00:27:23,477
<i>So they journeyed to a place
deep in the jungle</i>

611
00:27:23,644 --> 00:27:28,065
<i>To find answers.
Hi, john.</i>

612
00:27:28,398 --> 00:27:30,067
Claire?

613
00:27:30,234 --> 00:27:33,362
Don't worry. I'm fine.
I'm with him.

614
00:27:33,529 --> 00:27:35,405
I'm christian.

615
00:27:35,572 --> 00:27:37,449
You know why i'm here?

616
00:27:37,616 --> 00:27:39,284
Yeah. Do you?

617
00:27:39,451 --> 00:27:41,829
Because i was chosen to be.

618
00:27:41,995 --> 00:27:44,331
That's absolutely right.

619
00:27:44,498 --> 00:27:47,543
How do i save the island?

620
00:27:47,709 --> 00:27:50,921
Did he tell you what
we're supposed to do?

621
00:27:51,088 --> 00:27:53,507
He wants us
to move the island.

622
00:27:53,674 --> 00:27:56,969
Well, if you can move
the island, why didn't you just

623
00:27:57,135 --> 00:27:59,388
Move it before those psychos
with guns got here?

624
00:27:59,555 --> 00:28:01,515
It's a measure of last resort.
Awesome.

625
00:28:01,682 --> 00:28:04,059
Hey, sayid. Listen.

626
00:28:04,226 --> 00:28:06,395
We need to get these people
off this island.

627
00:28:06,562 --> 00:28:10,941
<i>I can start ferrying people now. A window
of opportunity opened, and the science team</i>

628
00:28:11,108 --> 00:28:13,026
<i>Began shuttling survivors
to the freighter.</i>

629
00:28:13,193 --> 00:28:16,238
<i>And in the jungle, ben lured
the mercenary team into a trap.</i>

630
00:28:16,405 --> 00:28:19,199
We know
that ben is a bad guy

631
00:28:19,366 --> 00:28:21,535
Because this boat full
of even worse guys-

632
00:28:21,702 --> 00:28:24,496
<i>They're trying to get him. I
believe you're looking for me?</i>

633
00:28:24,663 --> 00:28:27,541
You send, like, 15 armed guys just to
get this little guy. To extract him.

634
00:28:27,708 --> 00:28:32,129
Yeah. Yeah, but they're unsuccessful.

635
00:28:36,175 --> 00:28:38,385
Thank you for coming,
richard.

636
00:28:38,552 --> 00:28:39,803
He kills 'em all.
Yeah.

637
00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:42,472
What was the arrangement?
They, uh, help us free you,

638
00:28:42,639 --> 00:28:46,894
And we let 'em off the island. Fair
enough. The helicopter is yours.

639
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:48,854
You have
a safe journey back.

640
00:28:49,021 --> 00:28:51,440
So we can go...
off the island?

641
00:28:51,607 --> 00:28:53,192
That's it?

642
00:28:53,358 --> 00:28:55,527
That's it.

643
00:28:55,694 --> 00:28:57,988
<i>But before they could leave,</i>

644
00:28:58,155 --> 00:29:00,574
<i>Jack and locke
had unfinished business.</i>

645
00:29:00,741 --> 00:29:03,785
<i>You're not supposed to go home.
Then what am i supposed to do?</i>

646
00:29:03,952 --> 00:29:06,205
Locke says, "jack, don't go.
This is our purpose.

647
00:29:06,371 --> 00:29:09,750
It's our reason. It's our destiny," you know?
And he says, "you're nutty. You're crazy.

648
00:29:09,917 --> 00:29:12,753
You've got a screw loose."
Good-Bye, john.

649
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:15,589
You're gonna have to lie.

650
00:29:15,756 --> 00:29:17,674
Excuse me?

651
00:29:17,841 --> 00:29:19,635
If you have to go,

652
00:29:19,801 --> 00:29:21,595
Then you have to lie
about everything.

653
00:29:21,762 --> 00:29:23,805
It's the only way
to protect it.

654
00:29:23,972 --> 00:29:26,767
<i>It's an island, john.
No one needs to protect it.</i>

655
00:29:26,934 --> 00:29:28,644
It's not an island.

656
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:31,438
It's alace
where miracles happen.

657
00:29:31,605 --> 00:29:34,441
There's no such thing
as miracles.

658
00:29:34,608 --> 00:29:38,111
Just wait till you see
what i'm about to do.

659
00:29:38,278 --> 00:29:40,864
<i>Locke and ben descended
deep below a dharma station</i>

660
00:29:41,031 --> 00:29:43,784
<i>Called the orchid.</i>

661
00:29:43,951 --> 00:29:46,495
And underneath the orchid
is this mysterious wheel,

662
00:29:46,662 --> 00:29:49,122
And if you turn that wheel,
that will actually

663
00:29:49,289 --> 00:29:50,958
Cause the island to move
in space-Time.

664
00:29:51,124 --> 00:29:55,546
Sayid! Kate!
It's good to see you, dude.

665
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:59,675
Are you okay?
I am now.

666
00:29:59,842 --> 00:30:01,927
Let's go, freckles.

667
00:30:02,094 --> 00:30:05,931
I've seen enough
of this rock.

668
00:30:06,098 --> 00:30:09,059
<i>The moment they had hoped for
finally arrived.</i>

669
00:30:09,226 --> 00:30:11,728
Let's go for a ride!

670
00:30:11,895 --> 00:30:14,189
<i>They were going home.</i>

671
00:30:14,356 --> 00:30:16,733
<i>But before the survivors
reached the freighter,</i>

672
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:18,861
<i>They were met
with yet another obstacle.</i>

673
00:30:19,027 --> 00:30:20,737
There is this moment
in the helicopter

674
00:30:20,904 --> 00:30:22,865
When they're heading
for the freighter.

675
00:30:23,031 --> 00:30:25,742
The chopper is running out
of gas. It's not gonna

676
00:30:25,909 --> 00:30:28,328
Make it safely to the boat.
I'd feel a hell of a lot better

677
00:30:28,495 --> 00:30:30,372
If we were a few hundred
pounds lighter! Hey!

678
00:30:30,539 --> 00:30:32,374
(Lindelo sawyer leans over,
he whispers

679
00:30:32,541 --> 00:30:35,335
In kate's ear something-
We don't hear what it is.

680
00:30:35,502 --> 00:30:37,337
And just before she realizes
what he's gonna do,

681
00:30:37,504 --> 00:30:39,214
He jumps out.
Sawyer!

682
00:30:39,381 --> 00:30:42,217
And that's how
he gets left behind.

683
00:30:42,384 --> 00:30:44,094
And ever since that moment,

684
00:30:44,261 --> 00:30:46,471
Jack has wondered,
what did he say to her?

685
00:30:46,638 --> 00:30:49,266
<i>Sawyer's leap allowed his
friends to reach the freighter.</i>

686
00:30:49,433 --> 00:30:51,768
<i>But when they arrived,
they quickly learned</i>

687
00:30:51,935 --> 00:30:54,897
<i>The mercenary team
rigged the boat with explosives</i>

688
00:30:55,063 --> 00:30:58,442
<i>That were about to blow.</i>

689
00:30:58,609 --> 00:31:03,030
It's jin!

690
00:31:06,617 --> 00:31:11,121
<i>Jin!</i>

691
00:31:12,289 --> 00:31:15,584
What are you doing here?
Decided to take a dip.

692
00:31:15,751 --> 00:31:17,211
What you celebratin'?

693
00:31:17,377 --> 00:31:19,171
I'm not celebrating.

694
00:31:19,338 --> 00:31:22,174
The thing about sawyer jumping
is it kind of backfires.

695
00:31:22,341 --> 00:31:24,968
<i>Is that our boat?
It was.</i>

696
00:31:25,135 --> 00:31:26,929
Jumping off
the chopper might just have led

697
00:31:27,095 --> 00:31:30,390
To him saving his own life,
but he now thinks that jack

698
00:31:30,557 --> 00:31:34,269
And kate and hurley and sayid and desmond
and the baby... they could all be dead.

699
00:31:34,436 --> 00:31:37,898
Cod all be completely dead.
Yeah. The helicopter turns around,

700
00:31:38,065 --> 00:31:41,026
Now starts flying towards the
island... yeah, what is that?

701
00:31:41,193 --> 00:31:46,323
And then all of a sudden,
there's a giant white flash...

702
00:31:46,573 --> 00:31:48,617
and the island disappears.

703
00:31:48,784 --> 00:31:52,246
And all that's left are a couple
of ring waves on the water.

704
00:31:52,412 --> 00:31:54,748
Now you have this helicopter
just flying around

705
00:31:54,915 --> 00:31:57,042
In the middle of the ocean
with no place toand,

706
00:31:57,209 --> 00:32:00,671
And the helicopter
crashes into the water.

707
00:32:00,838 --> 00:32:04,341
Get the baby.

708
00:32:04,508 --> 00:32:06,760
Jack? Where's desmond?

709
00:32:06,927 --> 00:32:08,428
Get the baby.
I got him.

710
00:32:08,595 --> 00:32:10,305
And they're screwed. They're out
in the middle of the water.

711
00:32:10,472 --> 00:32:13,350
There's no way that anyone's
ever gonna find them.

712
00:32:13,517 --> 00:32:15,686
Lo and behold,
there's this boat.

713
00:32:15,853 --> 00:32:20,274
God almighty.
There's a boat out there!

714
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:22,276
Hey!

715
00:32:22,442 --> 00:32:25,445
We're gonna have to lie.
Lie about what?

716
00:32:25,612 --> 00:32:28,282
Every moment since we crashed
on the island.

717
00:32:28,448 --> 00:32:30,951
You said that our plane
was discovered

718
00:32:31,118 --> 00:32:32,953
On the bottom of the ocean.
Well, someone put it there-

719
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,622
Someone who wants everyone
to think that we're dead.

720
00:32:35,789 --> 00:32:37,875
So what do you think's
gonna happen to us

721
00:32:38,041 --> 00:32:41,128
When we tell them that
that wasn't our plane?

722
00:32:41,295 --> 00:32:44,298
What do you think's gonna happen to the people
we left behind? Jack, we can't pull it off.

723
00:32:44,464 --> 00:32:47,176
Just let me do the talking.

724
00:32:47,342 --> 00:32:49,219
Ms. Widmore!

725
00:32:49,386 --> 00:32:53,140
Throw them a rope! Take them
'round to the stern! Penny?

726
00:32:53,307 --> 00:32:57,728
Penny!

727
00:33:04,526 --> 00:33:09,198
I love you, penny,
and i'll never leave you again.

728
00:33:12,242 --> 00:33:15,370
This is penny. This is
kate and-And aaron. Hi.

729
00:33:15,537 --> 00:33:18,665
And jack. Jack, this is penny.
It's nice to meet you, penny.

730
00:33:18,832 --> 00:33:20,083
Hi.

731
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:24,671
But we need to talk.

732
00:33:28,008 --> 00:33:30,052
Why are we doing this, dude?

733
00:33:30,219 --> 00:33:33,680
Because it's the only way
to keep them safe.

734
00:33:33,847 --> 00:33:35,849
<i>To protect the friends
they left behind,</i>

735
00:33:36,016 --> 00:33:38,018
<i>The survivors agreed to lie.</i>

736
00:33:38,185 --> 00:33:41,897
<i>You sure about this,
brother? Are you sure?</i>

737
00:33:42,064 --> 00:33:44,358
As long as i've got penny,
i'll be fine.

738
00:33:44,525 --> 00:33:48,403
Then i'll see you in
another life, brother. Aye.

739
00:33:48,570 --> 00:33:50,447
<i>And so began
their long journey home,</i>

740
00:33:50,614 --> 00:33:52,950
<i>Where the life
that awaited them</i>

741
00:33:53,116 --> 00:33:54,993
<i>Was not what they'd hoped fo</i>

742
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:57,704
Six of them came back
to civilization.

743
00:33:57,871 --> 00:34:00,082
They are jack, kate, hurley,

744
00:34:00,249 --> 00:34:03,794
Sayid, sun and baby aaron.

745
00:34:03,961 --> 00:34:06,421
These people who will be known
as the "oceanic six"

746
00:34:06,588 --> 00:34:09,925
Decide to lie. We were in
the water for over a day

747
00:34:10,092 --> 00:34:11,635
Before the current took us in.
By then,

748
00:34:11,802 --> 00:34:13,929
There was only eight of us left.

749
00:34:14,096 --> 00:34:15,430
They wanna
protect everybody

750
00:34:15,597 --> 00:34:17,724
That was left on the island.
So they go along with this lie,

751
00:34:17,891 --> 00:34:20,727
And this becomes a part of their
cover story. Is it poible there are

752
00:34:20,894 --> 00:34:23,814
Any other survivors from the crash
yet to be discoved? No. Absolutely not.

753
00:34:23,981 --> 00:34:26,275
They quickly discover that
they really didn't have much

754
00:34:26,441 --> 00:34:27,943
In the way of lives
back in the real world.

755
00:34:28,110 --> 00:34:30,946
There was this sort of
gnawing feeling

756
00:34:31,113 --> 00:34:32,906
That maybe
they made a mistake,

757
00:34:33,073 --> 00:34:35,576
Maybe they shouldn't have left
the island in the first place.

758
00:34:35,742 --> 00:34:37,911
Hey, how's everybody doing?
What are you talking about?

759
00:34:38,078 --> 00:34:40,747
Building a fire or hunting
boars? They have survivors' guilt,

760
00:34:40,914 --> 00:34:44,042
And that makes them pretty
miserable. She looks just like jin.

761
00:34:44,209 --> 00:34:46,503
Yes, she does.

762
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:48,839
Sun's in kind of
a tragic place

763
00:34:49,006 --> 00:34:50,841
Because she's back
in the real world,

764
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:52,968
And she's kind of living in-
With the tragedy of believing

765
00:34:53,135 --> 00:34:55,512
That her husband died
in this freighter explosion.

766
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:57,598
She has a daughter,
and she's not really that able

767
00:34:57,764 --> 00:35:01,143
To move on with her life because
she's so distraught and angry

768
00:35:01,310 --> 00:35:05,731
Over the circumstances
of his death.

769
00:35:07,399 --> 00:35:09,443
<i>The last time we saw her,</i>

770
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:11,653
She was actually having
this sort of secret meeting

771
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:14,239
With charles widmore, who,
last we checked, was a bad guy.

772
00:35:14,406 --> 00:35:15,616
You and i have
common interests.

773
00:35:15,782 --> 00:35:19,328
When you're ready
to discuss them, call me.

774
00:35:19,495 --> 00:35:21,997
As you know, we're not the only
ones who left the island.

775
00:35:22,164 --> 00:35:24,500
We know the only other person
who's le the island,

776
00:35:24,666 --> 00:35:27,294
And that's benjamin linus via
sort of unconventional means.

777
00:35:27,461 --> 00:35:30,380
He basically
pushes this wheel underground

778
00:35:30,547 --> 00:35:32,591
In a cavern somewhere.

779
00:35:32,758 --> 00:35:34,760
He gets bathed in light,
and then suddenly he wakes up

780
00:35:34,927 --> 00:35:38,222
<i>The desert in tunisia
in the middle of nowhere.</i>

781
00:35:38,388 --> 00:35:42,809
<i>I just want
to bury my wife in peace.</i>

782
00:35:43,519 --> 00:35:45,437
Mr. Jarrah?

783
00:35:45,604 --> 00:35:48,148
There's a woman outside.
She says she knows you,

784
00:35:48,315 --> 00:35:50,192
But she wasn't on
the list of family members.

785
00:35:50,359 --> 00:35:52,069
When the oceanic six are finally
rescued and discovered,

786
00:35:52,236 --> 00:35:54,738
The love of his life,
this woman named nadia,

787
00:35:54,905 --> 00:35:56,573
Is there to greet sayid.

788
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:59,159
And they finally get to pick up
where they left off,

789
00:35:59,326 --> 00:36:01,453
And they're married.

790
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:04,039
Unfortunately, this marriage
does not last long

791
00:36:04,206 --> 00:36:05,874
Because nadia dies
in an accident.

792
00:36:06,041 --> 00:36:07,835
Benjamin linus comes to sayid
and tells him,

793
00:36:08,001 --> 00:36:11,004
"This was no accident.
Your wife was murdered."

794
00:36:11,171 --> 00:36:13,757
Why would these people
want to murder her?

795
00:36:13,924 --> 00:36:15,717
And he gives sayid
a list of names,

796
00:36:15,884 --> 00:36:18,470
Sort of this vast consortium
of men

797
00:36:18,637 --> 00:36:20,556
Who-Who might or might not
work for charles widmore.

798
00:36:20,722 --> 00:36:22,516
Since that time,

799
00:36:22,683 --> 00:36:24,852
Sayid has spent all of his time
exacting vengeance

800
00:36:25,018 --> 00:36:27,104
By killing anybody who
benjamin linus tells him to.

801
00:36:27,271 --> 00:36:31,275
I have another name for you.

802
00:36:31,441 --> 00:36:33,777
Who's next?
That's acting out.

803
00:36:33,944 --> 00:36:36,697
That's what i would do if i were
feeling guilty. I just killed a man

804
00:36:36,864 --> 00:36:39,199
Who's been perched outside
this facility for the last week.

805
00:36:39,366 --> 00:36:42,870
I want you to come with me.
We're not going back, are we

806
00:36:43,036 --> 00:36:45,289
No, just somewhere safe.

807
00:36:45,455 --> 00:36:48,292
I don't think
we did the right thing, jack.

808
00:36:48,458 --> 00:36:50,919
I think it wants us
to come back. Hurley...

809
00:36:51,086 --> 00:36:54,006
<i>and it's gonna do everythingt can
- We're never going back!</i>

810
00:36:54,173 --> 00:36:56,425
There's a strong
moral streak in hurley.

811
00:36:56,592 --> 00:36:58,093
He's not really
very comfortable

812
00:36:58,260 --> 00:37:00,137
With the idea that
they are telling this lie

813
00:37:00,304 --> 00:37:02,306
And they've left these other
people behind on the island.

814
00:37:02,472 --> 00:37:04,641
And since he's gotten
off the island,

815
00:37:04,808 --> 00:37:07,144
He starts to see dead people.
Help!

816
00:37:07,311 --> 00:37:09,813
What the hell
is wrong with you?

817
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:12,024
And this makes hurley, uh,
basically freak out,

818
00:37:12,191 --> 00:37:14,485
And he gets himself
thrown into the nuthouse

819
00:37:14,651 --> 00:37:16,487
In order to avoid that.

820
00:37:16,653 --> 00:37:19,156
I've been having regular
conversations with dead people.

821
00:37:19,323 --> 00:37:21,241
The last thing i need now
is paranoia.

822
00:37:21,408 --> 00:37:23,160
Don't move!

823
00:37:23,327 --> 00:37:26,663
I
- Just don't bring him back, kate.

824
00:37:26,830 --> 00:37:31,251
<i>Don't you dare bring him back!</i>

825
00:37:32,002 --> 00:37:35,047
Kate comes back
to civilization,

826
00:37:35,214 --> 00:37:38,050
And she tries on the role
of bel a responsible person.

827
00:37:38,217 --> 00:37:40,093
She's got this kid, aaron,

828
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:42,054
Who she's telling everyone
is her child

829
00:37:42,221 --> 00:37:44,097
But, in fact, was actually
claire's child.

830
00:37:44,264 --> 00:37:46,642
So every day, she sort of
sees the gravity... hey.

831
00:37:46,808 --> 00:37:48,727
Of the lie that she's telling.

832
00:37:48,894 --> 00:37:51,438
Maybe you and i could
grab some coffee together.

833
00:37:51,605 --> 00:37:53,273
She starts a relationship up
with jack.

834
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,317
In fact,
they actually get engaged

835
00:37:55,484 --> 00:37:57,361
And look like they're
gonna get married.

836
00:37:57,528 --> 00:38:00,489
Of course i will. Yes.
It works for a while,

837
00:38:00,656 --> 00:38:03,408
But then things
start to unravel.

838
00:38:03,575 --> 00:38:05,786
She's keeping a secret
from jack.

839
00:38:05,953 --> 00:38:08,622
She made a promise to sawyer
before sawyer jumped out

840
00:38:08,789 --> 00:38:10,916
Of the helicopter, and she
won't tell jack what that is.

841
00:38:11,083 --> 00:38:14,336
Why won't you tell me?
Because-Because he wouldn't want me to.

842
00:38:14,503 --> 00:38:16,296
But he's not here, is he?

843
00:38:16,463 --> 00:38:18,590
<i>I'm the one who's here.</i>

844
00:38:18,757 --> 00:38:20,634
I'm the one who sad you.

845
00:38:20,801 --> 00:38:22,636
So there's
this huge mystery

846
00:38:22,803 --> 00:38:25,305
That's hanging over them,
and jack refuses to trust her.

847
00:38:25,472 --> 00:38:27,391
If you have problems,
you need to figure them out,

848
00:38:27,558 --> 00:38:29,810
'Cause i can't have you
like this around my son.

849
00:38:29,977 --> 00:38:33,313
He just won't let it go,
and their relationship explodes.

850
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:37,901
You're not even related
to him!

851
00:38:41,238 --> 00:38:44,408
About ten months ago,

852
00:38:44,575 --> 00:38:47,369
I wrote what i wanted to say
at my father's funeral

853
00:38:47,536 --> 00:38:51,081
On the back of a cocktail napkin
at the sydney airport.

854
00:38:51,248 --> 00:38:53,333
Once jack left the island,

855
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:56,003
He finally gets to have
his father's funeral.

856
00:38:56,170 --> 00:38:57,880
This australian woman
comes up to jack afterwards

857
00:38:58,046 --> 00:39:00,465
And introduces herself and says,
"i knew your father.

858
00:39:00,632 --> 00:39:03,802
"In fact, um, i probably
shouldn't tell you this,

859
00:39:03,969 --> 00:39:06,138
But he's the father
of my daughter."

860
00:39:06,305 --> 00:39:09,850
She was one of the ones who died
when your plane hit the water.

861
00:39:10,017 --> 00:39:12,477
Her name was claire.

862
00:39:12,644 --> 00:39:15,689
Jack is now harboring
this incredible secret.

863
00:39:15,856 --> 00:39:17,733
It was emotionally devastating
for him to learn,

864
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:21,612
<i>After leaving claire behind,
that this was his half-Sister.</i>

865
00:39:21,778 --> 00:39:24,323
Um, jack starts popping pills
and drinking.

866
00:39:24,490 --> 00:39:28,035
He starts seeing ghosts, which is bad.
He-Yeah, which is not- That's not a good thing.

867
00:39:28,202 --> 00:39:30,954
No. And he grows this
really bad beard... yeah.

868
00:39:31,121 --> 00:39:33,207
Which is another sign.
Yeah, he's not a happy guy,

869
00:39:33,373 --> 00:39:35,626
And i think when you see
how getting off the island

870
00:39:35,792 --> 00:39:38,212
Has affected jack, maybe in fact
this reinforces the notion

871
00:39:38,378 --> 00:39:40,214
That they have
a greater destiny,

872
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:42,382
And that
that destiny is on the island.

873
00:39:42,549 --> 00:39:45,177
<i>Jack finally
came to this realization</i>

874
00:39:45,344 --> 00:39:49,056
<i>Three years
after leaving the island...</i>

875
00:39:49,223 --> 00:39:53,644
<i>when he learned of the death
of one of his fellow survivors.</i>

876
00:39:53,810 --> 00:39:55,938
When he finds out
that locke is dead,

877
00:39:56,104 --> 00:39:58,232
He's so devastated
that he tries to kill himself.

878
00:39:58,398 --> 00:40:00,275
He goes and, like, gets
on a bridge and is gonna jump.

879
00:40:00,442 --> 00:40:02,986
And you go, wow, why is jack
so upset that locke is dead?

880
00:40:03,153 --> 00:40:04,988
I think what
he comes to realize is

881
00:40:05,155 --> 00:40:07,449
They're kind of two sides
of the same coin.

882
00:40:07,616 --> 00:40:09,952
In a way, they kind of
need each other,

883
00:40:10,118 --> 00:40:11,912
And the island needs
both of them in a way that jack

884
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:13,497
Doesn't really understand
until that point.

885
00:40:13,664 --> 00:40:17,626
He told me
that after i left island,

886
00:40:17,793 --> 00:40:20,003
Some very bad things
happened.

887
00:40:20,170 --> 00:40:23,549
And he told me that it was
my fault for leaving.

888
00:40:23,715 --> 00:40:27,636
And he said
that i had to come back.

889
00:40:27,803 --> 00:40:30,764
<i>All of you have to go back.</i>

890
00:40:30,931 --> 00:40:35,102
We're gonna have
to bring him, too.

891
00:40:35,269 --> 00:40:36,979
The journey for the oceanic six
is gonna be,

892
00:40:37,145 --> 00:40:40,941
How do we actually get back to this
place? This island was very hard to find

893
00:40:41,108 --> 00:40:43,402
Before any shenanigans
were pulled.

894
00:40:43,569 --> 00:40:45,320
Now the island
is completely gone.

895
00:40:45,487 --> 00:40:47,447
So even if you wanted
to get back to it,

896
00:40:47,614 --> 00:40:50,284
It'd be enormously difficult.
Meanwhile, the question is

897
00:40:50,450 --> 00:40:52,953
What hpened to the people
who were left behind?

898
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:55,038
I mean, the island disappeared
in a big flash of white ght.

899
00:40:55,205 --> 00:40:57,374
Where did they go,
and what are the consequences

900
00:40:57,541 --> 00:40:59,501
Of that flash
of white light?

901
00:40:59,668 --> 00:41:02,671
We've basically spent five years
with these people now.

902
00:41:02,838 --> 00:41:04,798
What's cool to us
about season five

903
00:41:04,965 --> 00:41:07,593
Is that the show's
finding a new gear.

904
00:41:07,759 --> 00:41:09,970
It's starting
to slip into that mode

905
00:41:10,137 --> 00:41:12,389
Of answering more questions
than it's asking.

906
00:41:12,556 --> 00:41:15,309
We really get the sense
that the characters

907
00:41:15,475 --> 00:41:17,352
Are moving toward something. Yeah,
there's a mythology to "lost,"

908
00:41:17,519 --> 00:41:19,730
But each season of the show
is a book,

909
00:41:19,897 --> 00:41:22,482
And this book has its own
particular characteristics.

910
00:41:22,649 --> 00:41:24,485
And there's some really great
adventure storytelling

911
00:41:24,651 --> 00:41:28,697
In this season that the audience
is gonna really love.

912
00:41:28,864 --> 00:41:31,074
We made a mistake.

913
00:41:31,241 --> 00:41:34,745
We... were not supposed
to leave.

914
00:41:34,912 --> 00:41:39,333
Yes, we were.

915
00:41:42,085 --> 00:41:46,590
We have to go back, kate.

916
00:41:47,925 --> 00:41:52,429
We have to go back!
