*A gay boy*

2
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,400
Sorry.

3
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,100
No you're not!

4
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:31,100
Give me a hug?

5
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,200
Who is my little man?

6
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,600
Me.

7
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,300
As is.

8
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:49,100
Just great.

9
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,300
Jordan!

10
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,900
Will he do it?

11
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:34,800
Yes, he'll do it.

12
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,600
He says he prefers alive specimen.

13
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,300
Did you sold your little
ass last night?

14
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:45,300
I can't believe that little
thing of yours is worth that much money.

15
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,400
Two hundred and change.

16
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:50,900
That is mine. It's a gift.

17
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:54,900
As you want, boyscout.

18
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,400
This telephone bill have to wait.

19
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
It's two hundred
plus what you owe me.

20
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
It is pretty more shake, kid. Do
test the water first before you going too deep, ok.

21
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:23,800
You're comin, sport?

22
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,600
Hows your mam?

23
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,100
She still thinks I'm cute?

24
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:46,100
I'm staying with
somebody else's mom.

25
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:53,800
Let's go.

26
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:11,800
Hi's kinda small?

27
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:15,400
Show him.

28
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:19,400
Its gotta be just like the picture.

29
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:24,300
You draw this?

30
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:27,000
Most of it.

31
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,900
It is not bad.

32
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:32,900
Decide which arm and
roll up your sleeve.

33
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:47,200
Your arm is very skinny kid.

34
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:54,400
I'm gonna  be late to school.

35
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,800
And what grade you are?

36
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:01,600
Eighth grade.

37
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:05,600
You'll have all the chicks fighting
for you when they see this.

38
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,300
He does not like girls.

39
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:09,900
Not true, Nathan?

40
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:13,300
I like them just fine!

41
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:17,300
Do not worry. I can fix that.

42
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,600
Alright fellas let's go,
Form a line right here.

43
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,800
Moove. Already! Already!

44
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,100
Shirt. Skin. Shirt. Skin.

45
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:52,400
Shirt. Skin.

46
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:56,400
Shirt. Skin. Shirt. Skin.

47
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,200
Skin!

48
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:04,100
Skin!

49
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:06,100
What is the matter with you? Move it!

50
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:10,100
Move it!

51
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,200
Nathan!

52
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,600
Enough!

53
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,200
Separate. Ya, let's go.

54
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:22,200
Go to the corner.
Put your nose against the wall.
Go!

55
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:26,300
Let's go.

56
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:50,500
I'm listening.

57
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:59,800
So what's goin on, Nathan?
Is it you or just everyone else?

58
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,000
I'll understand.

59
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,500
I doubt it.

60
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:12,500
Try me.

61
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:18,500
I have all day, how about you?

62
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,100
The doctor's given me an alergy test.

63
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:35,800
What are you alergic to?

64
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:39,800
That is what the test is supposed to find out.

65
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:53,500
It's my birthday.

66
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:58,300
Happy Birthday.

67
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Am I in trouble?

68
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:08,300
Go put on your shirt.

69
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:31,900
Nathan!

70
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:38,200
Your mother had another party last night.

71
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:41,100
Sorry, Ms. Ross.

72
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:45,100
Honey, you're the one I feel sorry for.

73
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:04,900
Today is my birthday.

74
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
You can eat lunch here, if your mam did
not prepared you anything.

75
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:36,500
Mam! I'm home.

76
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:53,400
Get your bum out my bed.

77
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:45,000
Mam! Wake up.There's a girl in my room.

78
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,100
Close the curtains, Nate.

79
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,600
What time is it?

80
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,300
It's noon. Get her up it's my room!

81
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,400

82

Please?

83
00:12:56,500 --> 00:13:00,500
Did you get it?

84
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,700
What would l do without you?

85
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:12,500
Your cake is in the fridge.

86
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,300
Why don't you smoke it?

87
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:19,300
Mabe you should mind your own buisiness.

88
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,200
Are these really necessary?

89
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:49,200
I'm not the bad guy, remember?

90
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:54,800
Hey, Grant.
You got the kids. Give me a hand, will you?

91
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:56,900
Ferris!

92
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:59,100
Palmer.

93
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:03,100
Stop playing games with me
Boon.I need to know.

94
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,400
-I need to know when
and where.&quot;

95
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:26,200
-For shure.
I spill out all my guts.
In fact,I want you to write my biography.
&quot;

96
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,300
-Chapter one one ...

97
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:31,300
-I'm sure it is a verry fascinating story.

98
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:34,700
-Look, Sherlock.
The more you know - the less I sleep!

99
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:38,600
-For now I'll keep my secrets!

100
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,800
-Is it really necessary?

101
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,300
-You're not the bad guy.

102
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:45,000
-Any  relatives?

103
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Ya he sais he has a father.We
are checking.

104
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:50,900
You contact social services?

105
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:53,800
Yeah, somebody is coming over.

106
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:57,800
The kid thinks it's his fault.

107
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,300
Hi, Nathan.

108
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:02,600
This is Detective Shuler.

109
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:06,600
Hello, Nathan.

110
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
What makes  you think that, son?

111
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I'm not your son.

112
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:24,100
Thet's just a figurate speech.

113
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:28,500
Over the years, if you ask me.

114
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,500
Why was it your fault?

115
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:36,500
I didn't know she was dead, and she was.

116
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:42,800
I didn't mean it , though.

117
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:57,000
I wonder how she will
feel,if it was me.

118
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,700
It would have break her heart.

119
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:01,200
How do you know that?

120
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,100
I have two sons of my own.

121
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:06,000
Did you ever sell one?

122
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I don't think so.

123
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:35,600
That's him right there.

124
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:06,700
Hey man, are you lost?

125
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,100
Oh yeah.

126
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:13,500
Nice ride.

127
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:17,500
Oh, I do not like that.

128
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:24,100
That's a nice car.

129
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:28,100
And a nice scrath there.

130
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I hope not.

131
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:38,400
Easy, man!

132
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,000
"The Ball of String More Grande
del Mundo"

133
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:57,200
End of the road, Ned.

134
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Going west?

135
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:51,300
What can we offer you?

136
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:53,000
A hamburger.

137
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,500
O kay. Anything to drink?

138
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:55,900
Just water.

139
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:59,900
OK.

140
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:21,100
It's really easy.

141
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:48,300
I'm a genius.

142
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:52,300
According to the rules.

143
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:02,200
You're heading west?

144
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:05,800
East.

145
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:09,800
When you pulled here you were heading west.

146
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,400
Wait.

147
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:13,400
What is the number?

148
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:24,500
No, no, not tomorrow. The next day..

149
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:26,500
It's the best I can do.

150
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:30,500
Because I have something I have to do
that's why!

151
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:34,900
Look, why would I fuck you?

152
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:38,900
Exactly.

153
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:11,900
Hey. It's  Boon.

154
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:16,900
Is he  still wants me to come?

155
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,200
Let me talk to him.

156
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,700
Why not?

157
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:25,200
O.

158
00:26:25,201 --> 00:26:26,201
All right.

159
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:29,200
Tell him I'm on my way.

160
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:57,100
I need that number, sunshine !

161
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:58,600
I got a pretty shitty memory.

162
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:01,000
Let's hope you don't !

163
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
What you got for trade?

164
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,900
Your life.

165
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:09,900
You're not that type.

166
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Jesus Christ.

167
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:21,600
Cool!

168
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:25,600
Move over.

169
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:40,700
Jee, if you drive this to Vancouver, it will take eight hours , tops!

170
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,100
Maybe seven.

171
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:44,000
I'm not going that far.

172
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,100
I think you are!

173
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:48,400
I'm not the "Greyhound", kid.

174
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:52,400
You should , maybe, slow down a little.

175
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:56,400
Well, it's your money.

176
00:27:56,400 --> 00:28:00,300
What's in Vancouver?

177
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:01,900
My father.

178
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:03,700
You blackmail him too?

179
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:07,700
I don't have to.

180
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,700
Stop looking at me.

181
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:12,200
There's nothing else to look at.

182
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:16,200
Jesus Christ.

183
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:25,500
You know what's a good dad?

184
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:29,300
Well, if you want I can tell you.

185
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:33,300
He always helps you with your homework,
takes you to the moovies, camping and stuf.

186
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:41,200
And listens what you want to say.
Even if its only junk stuf.

187
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:44,300
You read that in the dictionary?

188
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:45,500
Didn't yours?

189
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:47,700
My dad? Oh yeah!

190
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:51,700
Everything but no homework,
no camping,and no listening.

191
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:01,600
I'm hungry.

192
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:08,200
These are cough drops.

193
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:12,200
No, it's a damn cheeseburger!

194
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:45,200
It's real?

195
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:53,200
Holly shit!.

196
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:56,400
You are OK?

197
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:59,500
Give me that.

198
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:00,700
Let me see.

199
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:02,400
Slide your fingers. Let me see.

200
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,300
Oh yeah.

201
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:06,600
It is not so bad.

202
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,500
Not so bad.

203
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:12,500
This thing kinda kicks , don't it?

204
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Take.

205
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:22,100
I'm really sorry, Mr.

206
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:24,000
It's  Boon.

207
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,600
Sorry, Boon.

208
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:30,600
You could have killed me, you know?

209
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:33,200
You bleed to death overthere?

210
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:37,200
I'll be fine.

211
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:42,700
My name is Nathan.

212
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:44,500
It means God's gift..

213
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:47,200
Ypu don't say.

214
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:51,200
Here, clean that up.

215
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,100
There's the biggest ball of string
down that road.

216
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:21,100
How do you know?
I know a lot of things.

217
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:25,100
Can we stop ?

218
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:16,600
Hey. Take it out.

219
00:32:56,900 --> 00:33:00,900
It's not as big as I thought.

220
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:07,300
Mayby it's the heaviest, not the biggest.

221
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:11,600
But you got to admit, there's a lot of string.

222
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:31,900
You ever notice how, in the Science Fiction movies
...

223
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:35,900
... thy always make the World look so grim?
Like a nuclear bomb done it or something.

224
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:39,300
I never noticed.

225
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:43,300
You probbably never watch  many.

226
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:51,100
So what can we expect?

227
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,400
I hope it's good.

228
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:57,400
Looks after when you threw it and so do you.

229
00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:02,100
Right now it's enough to think about, thanks.

230
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:08,500
You are up to something, aren't you?

231
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:11,400
Everyone has got secrets.

232
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:15,400
Maybe you too.

233
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:29,900
I grew up in this town.

234
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Which side do you want?

235
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:58,200
That's your side.

236
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:02,200
Come on.

237
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,800
How is it?

238
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:43,800
First rate.

239
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:49,500
Nathan, I need that number.

240
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:53,100
It's important.

241
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:55,000
I can't give it to you.

242
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Why not?

243
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,000
If you have what you want
you will leave me here.

244
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,200
I won't  do that.

245
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:05,800
I promise.

246
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:09,800
A promise by a grown up
doesn't mean much.

247
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:20,200
Yeah, your'e right.

248
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:24,200
You have food on your face.

249
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:29,300
So do you.

250
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:41,300
You take care
number one, Nathan.

251
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:45,200
If you give away all you get what have you left for yourself?

252
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:48,100
You understand?

253
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:50,700
Okay.

254
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:54,700
You stay here. I have something to do.

255
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:19,100
Ireally like you !

256
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,300
How do you like me now?

257
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:27,100
I'm not your friend.

258
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:30,100
You need that number !

259
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:34,100
And you need a ride. So be here
when I get back !

260
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:49,100
How long has he been like this ?

261
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:53,100
You said he asked for me.

262
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:16,000
It's me, pap?

263
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:38,500
I have nothing to say, and never had.

264
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:42,500
And  maybe this isn't that bad so.

265
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:10,100
I found the stray.

266
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:12,900
Not like me, he won't bite.

267
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:16,900
His wags,  his tail.

268
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:23,100
I like him.

269
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:40,900
You look real good, pap.

270
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:05,900
Nathan!

271
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:56,000
Want to play?

272
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:00,000
Suit yourself.

273
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:10,500
Hello.

274
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,500
It's a nice over here.

275
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:21,900
Did you get your buisiness done ?

276
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:25,900
I have to stay the night. And we'll drive
to Vancouverfirst thing  morning.

277
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:29,700
But I got your number.

278
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:33,700
You still need a ride!

279
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:38,500
Why don t you play?

280
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:40,900
I don't know  how.

281
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:44,900
You hit a ball with a stick.
It is isimpossible not to know how.

282
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:50,200
Come on. Show them what you got!

283
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:54,200
Oh, come on!

284
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:17,400
He he, way to go ace!

285
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:30,700
All right. Choke up on  the bat a little bit.
Its too big for you.

286
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:34,700
And watch the ball - hit the bat, OK?

287
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:56,900
Mam!

288
00:43:56,900 --> 00:44:00,900
Hey, honey.

289
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:04,000
This is ..

290
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
Nathan.

291
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,400
And  ...

292
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:11,000
Boon.

293
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,700
Hi, Erin.

294
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:16,700
It's been a while.

295
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:22,800
Good looking boy.

296
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:26,900
So, what are you doing up here?

297
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:29,300
My father.

298
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:33,300
I heard, I 'm so sorry.

299
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:38,200
We gatta go.

300
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:40,300
Good to see you again.

301
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:43,500
Good to see you too.

302
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:47,500
Nice to meet you.

303
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:52,200
Have you ever seen Forest Rangers ?

304
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:53,300
The kids with the fort?

305
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:54,300
Yeah.

306
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:56,300
Thousand years ago.

307
00:44:56,300 --> 00:44:57,500
Which one you wanted to be?

308
00:44:57,500 --> 00:45:00,100
None. Chip.

309
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:01,900
She wanted to talk.

310
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:05,900
Good for her.

311
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:11,400
You said we were staying.

312
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:14,800
You stay, I'm out of here.

313
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:15,800
She broke your heart?

314
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:18,000
Something like that.

315
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,600
Only love can break a heart.

316
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:22,300
Neil Young said that in a song.

317
00:45:22,300 --> 00:45:24,100
He did, did he??

318
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:26,700
Something about mining for gold.

319
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:29,700
Yeah. Mining for a Heart of Gold.

320
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:31,900
I'm not shure tht it was exact exact gold.

321
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:34,600
..that's song - right?

322
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:38,600
Jesus... I hate this town.

323
00:45:41,900 --> 00:45:45,700
I thought i'll feel different
but I don't.

324
00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:49,700
You saw your father.
Is that's why we're here ?

325
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:53,300
Yeah.

326
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:54,400
Was he happy to see you?

327
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:56,600
The man is a fucking asshole, all right?

328
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:58,300
So just save the "happy reunion" quastions !

329
00:45:58,300 --> 00:45:59,800
Do not take it out on me.

330
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:01,000
I'm just curious.

331
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:05,000
Do not waste your time.

332
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:09,500
Did he ever hit you?

333
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:15,100
I hope that is not
your story, Nathan.

334
00:46:15,100 --> 00:46:19,100
My dad never touched me.

335
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:23,700
Hello.

336
00:46:24,700 --> 00:46:26,600
Hello.

337
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:30,600
We are just on our way out.

338
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:36,400
Stay.

339
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:58,000
I think it's a Ferrari. GTO.

340
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:02,400
What about mine?

341
00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:08,700
Jaguar.

342
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:15,300
Aurora  plastics Corp., 1960.

343
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:17,600
My dad got it free.

344
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:20,300
What, on a spelling bee?

345
00:47:20,300 --> 00:47:24,300
No.  His best friend got caught stealind, so
than he give away all stuf.

346
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:27,200
My dad got the  racing.

347
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:30,000
And he didn't give it back?

348
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:34,000
Thats horrish.

349
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:40,700
Bet they weren't friends long after that.

350
00:47:40,700 --> 00:47:44,700
I guess not.

351
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:48,800
You never made it back for your mother's funeral.

352
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:52,900
Yeah, well, you know ...

353
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:02,600
Hey.
You married Ray Sullivan.

354
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:05,200
Ya.

355
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:09,200
He is...gone.

356
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:13,300
Well, Ray never was a reliable type.

357
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:17,300
He died when I was four.

358
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:20,600
Sorry, kid, I...

359
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:24,600
It's OK.

360
00:48:26,300 --> 00:48:29,700
What do you think you're doing?

361
00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:31,100
What?

362
00:48:31,100 --> 00:48:35,100
What do you mean "what" ?

363
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:39,200
I did not think anyone will want. It
still got four left.

364
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:42,100
Well, that's  not a good idea.

365
00:48:42,100 --> 00:48:45,100
I'm hungry.
You're hungry? Angel is he still here?

366
00:48:45,100 --> 00:48:47,400
I'm starving Mom, let's go!

367
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:51,400
Yah, it's still here.

368
00:48:57,700 --> 00:49:01,700
I'm sorry.
I should have asked .

369
00:49:01,900 --> 00:49:05,900
Is just that most of the boys your age
does not drink beer, Nathan.

370
00:49:06,700 --> 00:49:10,700
Sometimes, Boon let me have a sip.
When we go fishing.

371
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:15,700
You call him Boon?

372
00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:19,700
Sometimes dad, mostly - Boon.

373
00:49:20,100 --> 00:49:24,000
He says  titles are for government officials.

374
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:28,000
Hey, come on, let's go.

375
00:49:31,700 --> 00:49:34,300
Boon!

376
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:38,300
Smoking is not allowed here.

377
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:41,600
Come on.

378
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:45,600
Sorry.

379
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,600
It's been a lot of years.

380
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:07,800
It has been twenty, that's how long it's been.

381
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:10,500
We did not know if you
were dead or alive.

382
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:13,200
Not a word.

383
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:15,100
Yeah.

384
00:50:15,100 --> 00:50:19,100
At first I thought it was your father.

385
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:23,400
Then I blame myself.

386
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:26,800
I was seventeen.

387
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:30,800
You did better with Ray.

388
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:35,600
I never ment to hurt you.

389
00:50:38,100 --> 00:50:40,900
He's quita a little charakter.

390
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:44,900
He watches your every move!

391
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:51,200
He's done good, you should be proud.

392
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:53,700
Yeah, he's something.

393
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:57,100
What about his Mom?

394
00:50:57,100 --> 00:50:59,200
What did Nathan told you?

395
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:02,700
He said nothing.

396
00:51:02,700 --> 00:51:06,700
She died of an overdose.
He's better off without her.

397
00:51:14,300 --> 00:51:18,300
I loved you.

398
00:51:21,100 --> 00:51:25,100
You didn't know me than well.

399
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:39,100
Who is your girlfriend, Lloyd?

400
00:51:39,100 --> 00:51:43,100
See the great guy sitting there?

401
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:47,000
Hes my girlfriend's Dad.

402
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,500
Feel like smoking a bone later?

403
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:52,700
Might be.

404
00:51:52,700 --> 00:51:56,500
Meet us in front of the temle at 7.

405
00:51:56,500 --> 00:52:00,500
You smoke, right?

406
00:52:11,900 --> 00:52:15,900
How long we staying?

407
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:22,500
Lloyd and me want to go to the movie.

408
00:52:24,100 --> 00:52:26,500
So can I?

409
00:52:26,500 --> 00:52:30,500
Shure. Why not.

410
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:40,100
You told her I was your father?

411
00:52:40,100 --> 00:52:43,100
It just came out. I kinda look like you.

412
00:52:43,100 --> 00:52:46,300
No you don't. You don't look like me!

413
00:52:46,300 --> 00:52:48,600
Just a little.

414
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:49,600
You told her it's true?

415
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:52,600
No!

416
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:56,300
Hey. I'm not allowed to enter there.

417
00:52:56,300 --> 00:52:57,600
Why not?

418
00:52:57,600 --> 00:53:01,600
Here, come.

419
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,100
You broke low?

420
00:53:15,100 --> 00:53:16,400
Several times.

421
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:17,700
Why?

422
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:19,900
For I was a little shit.

423
00:53:19,900 --> 00:53:23,900
Never needed a reason why.

424
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
Jesus Christ.

425
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,100
Me neither.

426
00:53:27,100 --> 00:53:30,000
Hey! you know better than that.

427
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:34,000
You broke em.

428
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:40,200
I know you're up to something.
I don't think it's right!

429
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:53,000
I ain't going in there alone.

430
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:01,600
-Ya! Macaroni with ketchup.

431
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:03,500
No!-Yes!

432
00:54:03,500 --> 00:54:04,600
Macaroni with ketchup!

433
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:08,600
Nathan, help up !

434
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:13,200
She's your mam.

435
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:18,500
Is he OK?

436
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,500
What is wrong with Nathan?

437
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:25,500
I don't know , hunney.

438
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:28,300
I like that car!

439
00:54:28,300 --> 00:54:32,300
Its a Plymouth Superbird.
440 with six.390 horses.

440
00:54:36,100 --> 00:54:40,100
Dodge Supercharger.

441
00:54:42,100 --> 00:54:45,100
A 69 Torino. Totaly ugly.

442
00:54:45,100 --> 00:54:47,000
You read these stuf?

443
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:51,000
Well, mostly I look at the pictures.

444
00:54:53,700 --> 00:54:55,300
She's pretty sexy for a mam.

445
00:54:55,300 --> 00:54:59,300
Yes, she is.

446
00:54:59,300 --> 00:55:01,700
I can take Lloyd in a fight if I had to!

447
00:55:01,700 --> 00:55:04,400
I thought you like him?

448
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:08,400
Shure.
I just think it is important to you .

449
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:12,500
What is your favorite car?

450
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:16,200
GTO. Judge. 69. Convertible.

451
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:18,600
Impressive.

452
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:21,000
Want that?

453
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,200
No. You got the real thing.

454
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:27,200
Good.

455
00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:35,300
So what are they doin?

456
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:40,000
They're still talking.

457
00:55:40,100 --> 00:55:42,900
I think hi's gonna moan the lawn.

458
00:55:42,900 --> 00:55:45,100
I doubt it.

459
00:55:45,100 --> 00:55:49,100
This thing had been electrocute itself.

460
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:56,300
Last year he was my little boy, and now
he is 13 going on 30.

461
00:55:56,300 --> 00:55:59,400
He wants to hang out with all that big kids.

462
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:02,600
Last week, he invited this  boy to
a supper and I swear ...

463
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:06,000
... it was like the Pope
coming to dinner - the way Lloyd behaved.

464
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:10,000
It was  Wendy Ferguson's son Clay.
He will be sixteen in October.

465
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:14,000
And you will not gonna believe what I caught
him doing in the bathroom last week.

466
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:19,500
You know.

467
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:23,500
I think I have to tie his hands  behind his back
so he doesn't injure himself.

468
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:26,900
Maybe you should talk to him.

469
00:56:26,900 --> 00:56:29,400
Why?
From what you already told me he already has his techniqe done!

470
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:33,100
Boon, I'm serious.

471
00:56:33,100 --> 00:56:35,900
Does Nathan?

472
00:56:35,900 --> 00:56:39,900
I think he's well beyound all that.

473
00:56:51,900 --> 00:56:54,400
Well?

474
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:58,400
Put some sugar. To make it smoother a little bit.

475
00:57:06,700 --> 00:57:10,700
They're coming!

476
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:15,000
Nathan!

477
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:23,600
We are heading now.

478
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:25,600
Want to to go with them?

479
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:28,000
You will not like it, Mam.
Its just dumb asses and drug dealers.

480
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:32,000
Really? Then why don't you guys go watch the movie ...

481
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:36,000
... and ask all folks go sit on their swing  and drink lemonade...

482
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:40,900
Good idea, mam.

483
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:47,000
Hey.

484
00:57:47,700 --> 00:57:50,200
I want to treat Lloyd.

485
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:52,700
Let's see how fast you can spend that.

486
00:57:52,700 --> 00:57:54,000
But its five bucks just to get in!

487
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,300
Since when?

488
00:57:55,300 --> 00:57:59,300
Always.

489
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:05,000
And leave that .
My old man always made me
bring my own.

490
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:17,200
Give.

491
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:29,100
It's been in the fridge awhile..

492
00:58:29,100 --> 00:58:31,800
I like to try.

493
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:35,000
I'll kep this.

494
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,500
Let's go.

495
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:40,000
You know what? I will walk with you.

496
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:44,000
I'm gonna walk with them.

497
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:03,900
Nathan, do not have time for that.

498
00:59:03,900 --> 00:59:05,400
Why not go with them later?

499
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:08,700
Why yes. Ya, let's go.

500
00:59:08,700 --> 00:59:12,700
Come on!

501
00:59:15,500 --> 00:59:18,200
So you came here to see your grandfather?

502
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:21,000
Yep. I think he's dying or something.

503
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,100
Do not talk about it.

504
00:59:23,100 --> 00:59:24,400
The old man Palmer.

505
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:26,000
You know him?

506
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,500
Everyone knows everyone in this town.

507
00:59:28,500 --> 00:59:31,400
Can get all scary sometimes.

508
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:33,300
Whats your point?

509
00:59:33,300 --> 00:59:37,200
Let's put it this way.
I don't think he will be missed..

510
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:41,200
Why didn't your Mam come with you?

511
00:59:41,300 --> 00:59:45,300
She gets car sick.

512
00:59:46,100 --> 00:59:49,400
You know they used to grow up?

513
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:51,900
My mam and your dad.

514
00:59:51,900 --> 00:59:54,400
I know.

515
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:57,000
Did he loved her??

516
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:00,200
How am I supposed to know?

517
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:02,700
Yah, I guess so.

518
01:00:02,700 --> 01:00:05,000
It's hard to know with Boon.

519
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:08,000
Not with my mam.

520
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,600
I wish you guys stay longer.

521
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:14,600
Me too.

522
01:00:15,300 --> 01:00:17,600
I do not think this is
such a good idea.

523
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:19,300
They are cool, Nathan.

524
01:00:19,300 --> 01:00:21,200
Well, they didn't look so cool.

525
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:25,200
They got a car. What more do you want?

526
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,000
Hi is drunk.

527
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:30,000
So what?

528
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:31,600
Drop the damn bottle down, Dennis.

529
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:35,600
I mean it!

530
01:00:38,300 --> 01:00:42,300
Your turn, Nat.

531
01:00:55,300 --> 01:00:59,300
Lets go.

532
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:18,000
So what's that happy face ?

533
01:01:18,900 --> 01:01:21,500
It is a sad face, stupid.

534
01:01:21,500 --> 01:01:23,300
I'm lookin for a bruiser.

535
01:01:23,300 --> 01:01:27,200
I'll be old enough able to vote by the time you finish it, old man.

536
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:30,500
You suppose  you can do better?

537
01:01:30,500 --> 01:01:33,700
Just about anyone could do better.

538
01:01:33,700 --> 01:01:37,700
Do it, hot shot!

539
01:02:02,700 --> 01:02:06,700
On the paper, not in my eyes.

540
01:02:25,700 --> 01:02:29,700
So what else you do well?

541
01:02:30,300 --> 01:02:34,300
Your old man got any job?

542
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:41,000
It doesn't look like he does. All the dress of you.

543
01:02:41,500 --> 01:02:43,600
We make you said that.

544
01:02:43,600 --> 01:02:47,600
What does he do, exactly?

545
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:52,000
He is a tattoo artist.

546
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:56,000
Shure he is!

547
01:03:10,300 --> 01:03:14,300
Cool.

548
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:18,400
I got it for my birthday.

549
01:03:37,300 --> 01:03:39,500
You promised me a lemonade.

550
01:03:39,500 --> 01:03:43,500
My - it's right. I did.
You did!

551
01:03:43,900 --> 01:03:46,200
Well I'm going to get you your lemonade.

552
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:50,200
No, no. No.

553
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:55,800
What is it?

554
01:03:55,800 --> 01:03:59,800
How did you get that?

555
01:03:59,900 --> 01:04:03,300
I got shot.

556
01:04:03,300 --> 01:04:04,900
Who?

557
01:04:04,900 --> 01:04:07,900
I trusted  somebody I shouldn't have.

558
01:04:07,900 --> 01:04:11,900
I am more careful now.

559
01:04:11,900 --> 01:04:19,900
If it makes you feel any better, the guy
who made it went to jail. A long time ago.

560
01:04:36,100 --> 01:04:38,500
I want to see that movie.

561
01:04:38,500 --> 01:04:41,700
Tomorrow night it's half price.

562
01:04:41,700 --> 01:04:45,400
We're leaving in the morning.

563
01:04:45,400 --> 01:04:49,400
I get pissed whenever I want to. I have to
hide in the corner of nowhere.

564
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,200
Lloyd is happend fun.

565
01:04:54,200 --> 01:04:58,200
Well he drunk his first beer - what do you expect?

566
01:05:01,500 --> 01:05:05,500
Your eyes gonna burn a hole right trough me.

567
01:05:06,900 --> 01:05:10,500
Your tattoo. Did it hurt?

568
01:05:10,500 --> 01:05:14,000
A little.

569
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:18,000
Well, a lot.

570
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:31,000
Nathan.

571
01:05:33,500 --> 01:05:37,500
I live still with my mam.

572
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:44,400
It turn her on if I wached.

573
01:05:45,700 --> 01:05:49,700
It turn her boyfriends too.

574
01:05:52,700 --> 01:05:56,700
Sometimes I wanna feel all this stuff.

575
01:05:59,600 --> 01:06:03,600
I bet your mam sings in a church choir.

576
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:09,200
Yah, she does.

577
01:06:12,800 --> 01:06:16,800
I just wannna be a good kid. That's all.

578
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:23,200
Nathan ...
Just don't sanyone, OK?

579
01:06:24,100 --> 01:06:32,100
Our secret.
You don't tell mine, I don't tell yours.

580
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:54,300
It's not real.

581
01:06:54,300 --> 01:06:58,300
It's a hole, man, I am telling you.

582
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,300
No, it's not.

583
01:07:04,300 --> 01:07:08,300
How stupid are you? Ask Clay - his old man saw the X-Ray.

584
01:07:09,800 --> 01:07:13,800
You're a dick.

585
01:07:13,900 --> 01:07:15,400
Man, you give that back.

586
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:19,400
Your friend's stupid..

587
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:25,100
Is it real?

588
01:07:25,100 --> 01:07:28,100
I guess is as real as you want it to be.

589
01:07:28,100 --> 01:07:32,100
I'l prove it!

590
01:07:34,300 --> 01:07:38,300
What is he doing?

591
01:07:38,700 --> 01:07:42,700
Do it!

592
01:07:42,900 --> 01:07:46,900
Shit.

593
01:07:51,500 --> 01:07:55,500
You are OK, man?

594
01:07:58,600 --> 01:08:02,600
Shit! We are screwed!

595
01:08:20,400 --> 01:08:23,500
Looks solid to me.

596
01:08:23,500 --> 01:08:27,500
It's real!

597
01:08:29,200 --> 01:08:31,500
I can not go.
You have to get to Nathan for me.

598
01:08:31,500 --> 01:08:32,900
He's your son!

599
01:08:32,900 --> 01:08:34,700
I can't risk going in there.

600
01:08:34,700 --> 01:08:36,000
What?

601
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:37,500
It's complicated.

602
01:08:37,500 --> 01:08:38,900
What are you talking about?

603
01:08:38,900 --> 01:08:42,900
I can not explain it right now.
I just need you to trust me.

604
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:46,800
Not mine.

605
01:08:46,800 --> 01:08:47,500
What?

606
01:08:47,500 --> 01:08:49,300
Nathan is not my son.

607
01:08:49,300 --> 01:08:53,300
He told you I was, I went along with it.
I wanted you to think I had someone.

608
01:08:54,400 --> 01:08:58,300
Who the hell is he?

609
01:08:58,300 --> 01:09:02,300
Who the hell are you?

610
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:09,600
Do not let them see youcrying, man!
It's all  what they want.

611
01:09:20,100 --> 01:09:23,100
They don't send kids to jail.

612
01:09:23,100 --> 01:09:26,900
Besides, we didn't do nothing.

613
01:09:26,900 --> 01:09:30,900
You will be okay.

614
01:09:32,300 --> 01:09:35,300
Keep him is as ..

615
01:09:35,300 --> 01:09:39,300
I'd like to see my son now.

616
01:10:06,100 --> 01:10:10,100
Erin.

617
01:10:15,300 --> 01:10:19,300
Excuse me. I am looking for a little guy - Nathan.

618
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:32,800
Sorry, Boon.

619
01:10:41,400 --> 01:10:45,400
Come on. Let's get the hell out of  here.

620
01:10:46,100 --> 01:10:48,200
Pack your things together.
Weare leaving at the first light.

621
01:10:48,200 --> 01:10:49,700
Vacation's over.

622
01:10:49,700 --> 01:10:51,100
I don't have anything.

623
01:10:51,100 --> 01:10:55,100
Then get some sleep!

624
01:10:56,900 --> 01:10:58,300
Where you going?

625
01:10:58,300 --> 01:11:00,300
Out.

626
01:11:00,300 --> 01:11:02,300
It's not fair!
I could not say goodbye to Lloyd!

627
01:11:02,300 --> 01:11:06,300
You can send him a post card
when you get where you're going.

628
01:11:07,200 --> 01:11:08,500
One last screw, ha?

629
01:11:08,500 --> 01:11:12,500
Watch your mouth.

630
01:11:12,500 --> 01:11:16,500
I'm gonna ride you to Vancouvre. Thats all.

631
01:11:16,500 --> 01:11:20,500
After that we go separate ways.

632
01:11:21,400 --> 01:11:25,400
Let me say that to someone who cares.

633
01:11:52,400 --> 01:11:56,400
Erin opens the door.

634
01:12:02,600 --> 01:12:06,600
You have to trust me.

635
01:12:16,900 --> 01:12:20,900
A ball of string crashed the squad car?
Why don't you call Ripley

636
01:12:20,900 --> 01:12:24,900
One of the vandals has a t-shirt with yellow 'happy" face.
Upside down..

637
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:26,700
And you think that is our birthday boy?

638
01:12:26,700 --> 01:12:28,900
Maybe. His father grade him out.

639
01:12:28,900 --> 01:12:32,100
Great.Happy ending!
Can I leave now?

640
01:12:32,100 --> 01:12:36,100
But I didn't know that Boon
Palmer has son.

641
01:12:55,700 --> 01:12:57,400
Hi, Lloyd.

642
01:12:57,400 --> 01:13:00,000
I sneak out..

643
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,700
Whi did you say Boon is your dad?

644
01:13:02,700 --> 01:13:05,600
It is what I wanted.

645
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:06,900
He loves my mom.

646
01:13:06,900 --> 01:13:08,300
He said that ?

647
01:13:08,300 --> 01:13:10,800
He didn't have to !

648
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:13,300
Its not so bad.
You can stay in  my room
when you come back.

649
01:13:13,300 --> 01:13:15,700
Why do you think I'm coming back?

650
01:13:15,700 --> 01:13:18,400
Boon said it. I heard him - he's coming back!

651
01:13:18,400 --> 01:13:22,400
You're a liar.
You were supposed to be my friend !

652
01:14:38,100 --> 01:14:42,100
Hey, move over.

653
01:15:56,400 --> 01:15:59,000
You can fuck me if you want.

654
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:03,000
I think that's what I want?

655
01:16:03,400 --> 01:16:07,400
I,m pretty good at it!
Full charge is free!

656
01:16:08,500 --> 01:16:12,500
Stop that. Stop that.

657
01:16:12,700 --> 01:16:16,700
She does not need you.
Do not leave me.

658
01:16:46,500 --> 01:16:48,000
Nathan.

659
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:52,000
It's cold outthere.

660
01:17:41,500 --> 01:17:42,600
Is he here?

661
01:17:42,600 --> 01:17:44,800
No, I never so him.

662
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:48,800
All right, .. if he does..

663
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:54,800
... give him this.

664
01:17:57,100 --> 01:17:58,500
That simple?

665
01:17:58,500 --> 01:18:02,500
Yeah..so simple..

666
01:18:02,700 --> 01:18:06,700
I.. I.. gotta go.

667
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,300
I'll call you.

668
01:18:09,300 --> 01:18:12,300
You have not changed .

669
01:18:12,300 --> 01:18:15,700
I told you anything , I tought you understood..

670
01:18:15,700 --> 01:18:18,400
I don't even know his last name!
I can't help him, Erin.

671
01:18:18,400 --> 01:18:19,900
Who are you trying to convince?

672
01:18:19,900 --> 01:18:21,000
He's got a father.

673
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:25,000
No, Boon.
He went looking for one and he found you!

674
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:28,000
I got something big going down!
Can't you understand that?

675
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:32,000
Not about that kiss and all that some kids bustle off with broken heart.

676
01:18:32,400 --> 01:18:36,400
I take care of myself.
And if he issmart, he'll do the same.

677
01:18:36,400 --> 01:18:40,400
He's a little boy, Boon.

678
01:18:41,700 --> 01:18:45,700
You gatta to stop running!

679
01:18:45,700 --> 01:18:49,700
You're not your father!

680
01:18:53,100 --> 01:18:56,200
What's going on?

681
01:18:56,200 --> 01:19:00,200
He never asked for me..

682
01:19:17,700 --> 01:19:21,700
He never asked for me..

683
01:19:57,700 --> 01:20:01,700
So , what are you doing here?

684
01:20:03,100 --> 01:20:05,000
A lot can happen in a day.

685
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,200
Want to talk?

686
01:20:07,200 --> 01:20:11,200
No.

687
01:22:13,300 --> 01:22:15,500
I,m waiting for him to make the call..

688
01:22:15,500 --> 01:22:18,600
I don't think he knows where the drop is yet!

689
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:22,600
Listen to this.

690
01:22:45,800 --> 01:22:49,800
I need the phone.

691
01:23:02,400 --> 01:23:05,100
Hey.

692
01:23:05,100 --> 01:23:09,100
An idiot wants to use the telephone.

693
01:23:09,400 --> 01:23:13,400
Fuck you !

694
01:23:38,600 --> 01:23:42,600
Hey, I,m here.  Now what?

695
01:23:43,300 --> 01:23:46,700
No, it's a 67.

696
01:23:46,700 --> 01:23:50,700
Look, why don't you close sush the dough of shit!
It,s getting a little tiresome..

697
01:24:12,500 --> 01:24:13,500
Forty kilos.

698
01:24:13,500 --> 01:24:15,500
Yeah, that would be the magic number.

699
01:24:15,500 --> 01:24:18,100
Damn. That's almost ninety pounds!

700
01:24:18,100 --> 01:24:21,500
You fuck me - you're dead !

701
01:24:21,500 --> 01:24:25,500
So why are you keep saying that..

702
01:24:32,400 --> 01:24:36,400
What you see is what you get.

703
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:39,200
Get into  the car.

704
01:24:39,200 --> 01:24:43,200
Turn right at the next intersection.
At the end of the block turn left.

705
01:24:44,200 --> 01:24:46,500
Then what?

706
01:24:46,500 --> 01:24:50,500
Don't screw up!

707
01:26:50,900 --> 01:26:54,900
You're famous or something?

708
01:26:55,600 --> 01:26:59,600
Not exactly.

709
01:27:00,900 --> 01:27:04,900
Here we are.

710
01:27:04,900 --> 01:27:07,900
You bring a lot of boys up here?

711
01:27:07,900 --> 01:27:11,400
No. You are the first.

712
01:27:11,400 --> 01:27:15,400
Yeah, right!.
You're not my first.

713
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:23,000
You seem nice enough.

714
01:27:26,900 --> 01:27:30,900
I want to go all the way - just so, you know..

715
01:27:44,200 --> 01:27:48,200
Hey, come on.

716
01:27:48,600 --> 01:27:52,600
Let's have some fun, uh?

717
01:28:14,700 --> 01:28:18,700
Where did you go?

718
01:28:48,500 --> 01:28:50,200
See a boy coming here?

719
01:28:50,200 --> 01:28:51,500
Can you be more specific?

720
01:28:51,500 --> 01:28:53,500
Whose's that Cadillac out there?

721
01:28:53,500 --> 01:28:56,900
I can't  give that kind of information, I'm not allowed.

722
01:28:56,900 --> 01:28:58,200
This glass is bulletproof?

723
01:28:58,200 --> 01:29:00,100
Are you kidding?

724
01:29:00,100 --> 01:29:02,500
Who's is the fucking Cadillac?

725
01:29:02,500 --> 01:29:03,700
I have to check in my book ...

726
01:29:03,700 --> 01:29:07,200
Open the door.

727
01:29:07,200 --> 01:29:11,200
Ya, let's check the log.

728
01:29:11,200 --> 01:29:15,200
Hurry up, come on.

729
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:31,000
Get your little ass out here.

730
01:29:37,200 --> 01:29:38,500
We have a deal.

731
01:29:38,500 --> 01:29:42,500
Deal's off.

732
01:29:48,300 --> 01:29:52,300
Go, run.

733
01:29:59,800 --> 01:30:03,800
Open the fuckin door.

734
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:10,900
Where is he?

735
01:30:10,900 --> 01:30:12,000
In the bathroom.

736
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,800
 Get down!

737
01:30:14,800 --> 01:30:18,800
Listen to me.
You move.. you move an inch and I'll kill you.

738
01:30:22,500 --> 01:30:25,900
Nathan. You're in there?

739
01:30:25,900 --> 01:30:29,900
I Boon. Open up.

740
01:30:44,400 --> 01:30:48,400
Did he hurt you?

741
01:30:53,700 --> 01:30:57,700
I don't have a dad.

742
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:02,000
I ask my mam.
She didn't know...

743
01:31:05,700 --> 01:31:09,700
How is that possible?

744
01:31:10,200 --> 01:31:14,200
I don't have anyone.

745
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:24,000
Come here.

746
01:31:24,600 --> 01:31:26,300
Why?

747
01:31:26,300 --> 01:31:30,300
Because I said so.

748
01:31:37,800 --> 01:31:41,800
Closer.

749
01:31:43,500 --> 01:31:47,300
Is this close enough?

750
01:31:47,300 --> 01:31:51,300
Let's see.

751
01:31:59,100 --> 01:32:03,100
Do not worry. I won't let you go.

752
01:32:34,400 --> 01:32:38,400
Everything is fine.

753
01:33:38,900 --> 01:33:42,900
Let's get out of here.

754
01:34:11,800 --> 01:34:15,000
All that money in the trunk of this car...

755
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:16,600
You need a lot of beit if you go fishing for sharks.

756
01:34:16,600 --> 01:34:18,300
You caught it?

757
01:34:18,300 --> 01:34:21,600
Yes, you can tell, a big one.

758
01:34:21,600 --> 01:34:23,400
I thought you were a drug dealer.

759
01:34:23,400 --> 01:34:27,400
Why makes you think that?

760
01:34:32,300 --> 01:34:36,300
"Federal Police Canada"

761
01:34:36,300 --> 01:34:40,300
Cool!

762
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,100
What?

763
01:34:46,100 --> 01:34:50,100
I'm hungry.
