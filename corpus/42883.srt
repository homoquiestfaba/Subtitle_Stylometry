2
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:43,560
You were right.

3
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,640
This is definitely better than being at work.

4
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:52,040
One thing you didn't warn us
about though -- bloody midges.

5
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:53,760
You big girl's blouse!.

6
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:56,880
Anyway, now that you've mentioned work...

7
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:59,560
... and seeing as I bullied you
to come here to celebrate...

8
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,400
Here.

9
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,720
Congratulations.

10
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,360
No knight should be without his sword.

11
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,720
I don't know what to say.

12
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,960
What, my writer lost for words?.

13
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:20,640
It's perfect.

14
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:24,800
Yeah, and it's also solid silver so don't lose it!

15
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,880
Nice try, Private Cooper.

16
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:24,760
You've evaded capture for twenty-two hours...

17
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,240
... and forty-seven minutes.

18
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,920
Go straight to the head of the class.

19
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,040
Of course, the real trick to survival...

20
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,520
... lies not in running and hiding...

21
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:39,320
... but in removing your enemy's capacity
to hunt you down.

22
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,800
Here. Shoot the dog.

23
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,160
I'm sorry, sir, what?.

24
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,400
Take the weapon and use it.

25
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:02,840
During the seIection process,
you are under my command!

26
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,760
That's a direct order, Cooper!

27
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,080
You're taking the piss, right?.

28
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:12,280
He thinks I am pulling his Ieg. Do I Iook Iike
a sodding soldier comedian, Shitwipe?. !

29
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,120
No, sir!

30
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,280
I still won't do it.

31
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:20,160
You don't have a choice. Finish the job.
Shoot the dog.

32
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,280
Shoot it!

33
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,160
No, sir!

34
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:30,880
What use are you to my team...

35
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,440
... if you can't even kill a dog?.

36
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,240
I didn't say I couldn't kill a dog, sir.

37
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,600
I just will not kill that dog for no reason.

38
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,840
You're binned, Cooper.

39
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,880
-I don't need a man of conscience.
-You're failing me for this?.

40
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,800
You failed yourself!

41
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,120
We're on a different level here, Cooper.

42
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,320
For that...

43
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,200
I need men of action...

44
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,000
... not deeds.

45
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,640
No! You sick fucking bastard!

46
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,840
It's just a dog. That's all.

47
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:14,240
Maybe one day
when that's sunk into your thick skull...

48
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,480
... you'll be ready for us.

49
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,520
Until then, you live and learn.

50
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,680
Yeah, but you don't.

51
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,760
I don't do second chances, Cooper.

52
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,600
And I never forget.

53
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:39,760
RTU this pathetic piece of shit.

54
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,120
Send him back to his squad.

55
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,760
I want a good, clean dispersal.

56
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,560
I want a secure landing zone.

57
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,440
Go, go, go, go, go!

58
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,360
Joe, get out of the pissing chopper!

59
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,120
I'm not missing the footy for this,
it's totally bone!

60
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,880
I'm not going, sarge. I'm not going!

61
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,240
See you.

62
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:41,680
Cooper... I want a position and bearing.

63
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:44,040
-I want to be on the move in three minutes.
-On it, Sarge.

64
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,880
Spoon, Terry, you're on stag.

65
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,320
Joe, for fuck sake...

66
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:51,800
... get off your big, fat, Iardy arse
and make like a soldier!

67
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,840
Right then -- time sync.

68
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,840
I've got zero seven-thirty coming up in...

69
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:03,880
... three, two, one, check.

70
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,080
Oh bullocks, I don't believe this!

71
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,720
What is it now, Witherspoon?.

72
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,160
I've left my watch at the barracks, sarge.

73
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:11,240
You want to take a breather
every once in a while, son, you'll live longer.

74
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,720
Nice work, Spoon, you tosser.

75
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,160
Took the words right out of my mouth.

76
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:17,600
And you'll be taking my boot out your mouth
in a minute, Joe, you baldy twat!

77
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,280
Pissing hell!

78
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,240
Close shave,eh Joe?.

79
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,840
Oh, this shit is totally bone!

80
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,560
The most important football match
of my life is playing tonight...

81
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:26,520
... and I'm stuck up the backside of beyond
without so much as...

82
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,280
... a six-pack or a telly!

83
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,680
Yeah, well, that's the Army for you.

84
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,040
Hey, it's England v Germany, man.

85
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,120
Full-on footy war!

86
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,840
Yeah, well, it's nothing Iike this at all then,
is it Joe?.

87
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,640
It's just an exercise. Hardly life or death.

88
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,800
Don't bet on it, Joe, you're fucking slaying me!

89
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:41,520
If you'd paid any attention at all
during the briefing, Kirkley...

90
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,560
... you'd know exactIy who we were up against
on this harmless little exercise, wouldn't you?.

91
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:47,520
-And who's that then?.
-Special Forces, you plonker!

92
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,640
Bollocks to them!

93
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,200
All right, all right.

94
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:53,160
Now Iisten up, I'm gonna make this quick
and to the point...

95
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:55,080
... because, just Iike you, all I wanna do
is get home...

96
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:59,200
...jump into a warm bed with a nice hot woman
and watch the footy!

97
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,800
Planning on scoring, sarge?.

98
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,920
Yeah, well, mind you don't fouI her
in the penalty box.

99
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:04,080
All right, button it, private parts!

100
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:09,160
Now, as of this moment as far as we're
concerned, we are fifty 'K' behind enemy lines.

101
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:11,200
Now, if we do happen to make a contact...

102
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:14,600
... I expect nothing Iess than
gratuitous violence from the lot of you.

103
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:15,920
Because we're firing blanks

104
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:19,160
it doesn't mean we have to be thinking...
nice thoughts.

105
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,560
So you remember you put the fire down, right?.

106
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:22,480
You get stuck in and you kick their
fucking teeth out...

107
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:26,920
... or I'll guarantee you, Joe, they will be having
your bollocks for breakfast, sunshine!

108
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,680
Hard-boiled or fried, sarge?.

109
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:28,680
Scrambled.

110
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:30,920
Here you are, Spoonie.

111
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,160
Oh, smart.

112
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:34,760
Because it's nice and new and shiny
doesn't mean it's worth shit.

113
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,080
Remember I want that back, son.

114
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,800
What about you, sarge?.

115
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,880
Well, I'll count, won't l?.

116
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,040
Right then, Coop, what we got?.

117
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:47,960
We're here. The front line is here.

118
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:51,680
AWAC reports enemy positions here,
here and here.

119
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,680
With sweeping patroIs between
each of these forward bunkers...

120
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,800
... they'll have the whoIe sector wrapped
tighter than an Eskimo's nad-sack.

121
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,680
With one exception.

122
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:58,840
Right here.

123
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,200
A river crosses the line through a gorge

124
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,400
thirty or forty feet deep...

125
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,840
... and it's certain to have a patroI on it,
but if we go at night...

126
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:05,720
... tread careful and

127
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,960
don't mind getting our feet wet...

128
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,360
... I reckon we can make it through.

129
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,480
What the fuck is all this about then?.

130
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,960
Oh, with my Iuck IateIy,
I need all of the help I can get.

131
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,320
I know you think it was a piss poor call,

132
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:19,080
you failing selection and all of that, but...

133
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,120
... I gotta say, I'm not sorry.

134
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,360
The squad wouId be a Iot worse off
without you, mate.

135
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,760
It was something I had to do, you know.

136
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,880
For myself, get it out my system.

137
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,800
Listen, the onIy peopIe who go Iooking for
trouble are Kamikazes...

138
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:32,520
... glory boys and full-on fucking fuckwits!

139
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,480
Take my advice son, be patient.

140
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,400
Right then, ladies...

141
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,320
... pack up your troubles...

142
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,160
... put your brains in first gear and start tabbing!

143
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,160
Spoonie, you're on point.

144
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,440
Terry, Joe, tail-end Charlies.

145
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,520
Over here, Cooper, on my head.

146
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,120
You twatter!

147
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:56,080
I can't believe I'm missing the footy for this party!

148
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:59,720
Joe, if you don't shut up, I swear to God
I'm gonna fucking slot you myself!

149
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,400
-Now move!.
-Didn't say a word, sarge.

150
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,360
Where the hell are we now?.

151
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,400
I heard a cracking story about this place.

152
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:36,960
You what?.

153
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,760
PeopIe disappear out here.
Happens all the time.

154
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,720
Go on, Cooper, lad, give it some boolocks.

155
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,400
It's true.

156
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,880
Just Iast month a young coupIe were hiking
through these woods.

157
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:49,960
They set up camp somewhere near here.
During the night - something happened.

158
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:53,160
A mountain rescue team found the remains
of the camp a couple of days alter.

159
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:56,040
The tent was ripped to shreds
and there was blood everywhere!

160
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,040
The papers said it was a monster
like The Beast of Bodmin Moor.

161
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,800
Locals claimed it was an escaped lunatic.

162
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:07,120
But no-one's been caught so nothing
can be proved either way.

163
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,320
Every year more and more peopIe
come through here...

164
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,760
... and every one in a whiIe
they don't come back.

165
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,360
No trace, no bodies -- just disappear...

166
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:16,160
... and never seen again.

167
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,400
Contact camp.

168
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,280
Tell them the flock is heading for the fold.

169
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,160
Broadsword to base.

170
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,400
Come on then, Bruce, what scares you?.

171
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:19,080
The seIf-destructive nature
of the human condition.

172
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,040
You're just taking the piss now!

173
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,240
What, you think so?.

174
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:22,880
What about you then, Spoon?.

175
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:24,560
Castration.

176
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,440
There's no argument there. Joe?.

177
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:32,360
Joe, onIy one thing guaranteed
to put the shits up me.

178
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,840
A penalty shoot out.

179
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,240
-Figures.
-Terry?.

180
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:40,400
Watching a penalty shoot out -- with Joe.

181
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,400
What about you, Coop?.

182
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:46,720
Spiders -- And women.

183
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:51,080
And -- spider women.

184
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,680
I want to know what scares the sarge.

185
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,200
Piss off, man, nothing scares the sarge!

186
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,040
Oh, I don't know about that.

187
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:01,840
Well, the thought of never seeing my wife again
scares the shit out of me!

188
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,360
That and those IittIe things
that make your skin crawl...

189
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,320
... and the hair stand up
on the back of your neck.

190
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,200
You mean like Spoon?.

191
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:16,480
No, there's one thing actually, in particular...

192
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,920
... that I'll remember till the day that I die.

193
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,520
Yeah, it was back in ninety-one,

194
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:23,400
just before my unit was flown out to Kuwait...

195
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,320
... to mop up the last pockets of resistance.

196
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,600
Me and this young fella called Eddie Oswald...

197
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,160
... decided to go and get a tattoo done...

198
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:33,400
... to commemorate our first trip into the desert.

199
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,440
Yeah, I remember Eddie.

200
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:37,280
He was a stocky hard case...

201
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:39,320
... with a broken nose and a bong eye, yeah?.

202
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:41,360
Yeah, that's him. Good-Iooking fella.
Big hit with the ladies.

203
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:48,440
Anyway, me and Eddie,
we went and had a few drinks...

204
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:48,880
... we had a lot of drinks...

205
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,440
... then we went down to the tattoo parIour
and I got a Deser Rat done...

206
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:55,120
... and Eddie being Eddie wanted something
with a bit more meaning.

207
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,920
And being a bit of a believer...

208
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:02,800
... he said that his soul still belonged to God...

209
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,960
... but his fIesh, well, his fIesh
was way beyond redemption...

210
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,520
... and it was up to Satan to save his skin.

211
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:13,320
So he got this fucking great Iaughing deviI
tattooed right on his arse.

212
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:19,400
Anyway, about six days Iater we were making a
regular sweep along the lraqi border...

213
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:24,720
... and Eddie, poor fucker,
triggered an anti-tank mine.

214
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:28,520
Yeah. We all saw it happen.
I mean, he was on point.

215
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:32,760
White blinding lightning flash and

216
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,920
a fucking deafening crack.

217
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,920
And by the time we picked ourseIves up
off the deck, Eddie was...

218
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,320
... he was gone.

219
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:45,000
Just bits and pieces of him.
That's all that remained.

220
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:47,160
This big fucking red circle. Hundred metres.

221
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:52,400
I'll tell you something, Iads,
it really puts things in perspective...

222
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:54,600
... when you have to scoop your mate up
with a shovel and

223
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,880
stick him in a bin-bag.

224
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,400
Anyway, the thing that...

225
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:02,440
... really did our nuts in that day was when you...

226
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,560
... came across a bit you recognised.

227
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:11,680
Bit of ear -- toe, a nose, a tooth.

228
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:16,200
But the thing that really freaked us out that day...

229
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:20,360
... was when Left Hand CharIie found
the bit of Eddie with the tattoo on.

230
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:22,080
I mean everything eIse was burnt to a crisp,
covered in claret.

231
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,720
All mushed up, pulped up.

232
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,200
Not this bit. This bit was perfect.

233
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:30,880
And there's OId Nick chortIing
his fucking arsehole off at us!

234
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,080
So you could say that Eddie was right...

235
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:39,440
... that Satan did indeed save his skin,

236
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,320
just not all of it.

237
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,760
Or you could say that Eddie was just unlucky.

238
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:51,880
Either way it taught me to
keep a very open mind.

239
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,560
Boom boom.

240
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:03,720
Anyway... Eddie Oswald.

241
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,040
-To Eddie.
-To Eddie.

242
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,960
So, anyway, this bloke walks into a pub, right...

243
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,360
... with a little dog under his arm.

244
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,800
He puts it down on the bar, goes and sits down.

245
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,280
The bartender's looking at him thinking

246
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,520
"What the fucking hell's going on here??".

247
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:26,800
Then he looks back at the dog and,

248
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,240
to his surprise, the dog turns round and says...

249
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:30,160
It's a fucking cow!

250
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,040
Fucking hell!

251
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,280
Ceasefire, Terry, ceasefire.

252
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:38,520
Terry, what the hell are you doing?.
You're firing blanks, man!

253
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:39,000
Is everyone all right?.

254
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:41,200
No man, I think I've shit myself!

255
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,520
Is it dead?.

256
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,160
Oh yeah, it's dead all right.

257
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:52,080
-Christ, Iook at the state of it!
-Sod that, man, look at the state of Terry.

258
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:58,360
These aren't entry wounds --
More like teeth marks.

259
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,080
What are you saying, Cooper?.

260
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,760
What he's saying, Terry, is
it died of natural causes, mate.

261
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,720
Don't you think we should call this in, sarge?.

262
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:06,160
Aye, get on the radio, Bruce.

263
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:08,600
Now there's no way I'm about
to break radio silence...

264
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,680
... because you Iot got spooked
by a dead flying fucking cow!

265
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,800
No, we hoId this position.
We keep it secure till the morning...

266
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,160
... then we reassess the situation.

267
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,880
Right, I want a watch posted.

268
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:20,720
Two on, four off.

269
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:21,800
Brucie, Spoon, you're up first.

270
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:24,280
Cooper and I will reIieve you
at zero one hundred hours.

271
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,360
And in meantime - Terry sort your kit out!

272
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,120
The rest of you get your heads down.

273
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,400
Unbelievable.

274
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:30,280
Sarge...cow came in from this direction...

275
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,160
... straight off the edge.

276
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,840
Out of the frying pan on to the fire.

277
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,200
Bleeding to death

278
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,480
it couId have wandered around for miIes
before it got here.

279
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:40,840
Yeah, well, it's good of it to Ieave
some breadcrumbs for us to follow, eh?.

280
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:43,920
-Looking for troubIe?.
-No, Cooper -- just looking.

281
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:47,160
Sarge, shouIdn't we just report this
when we get back?.

282
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,920
Too fucking right, Terry. But in the meantime,

283
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,800
I'm curious and it's on our way.

284
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,000
Come on, lads.

285
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:55,560
Natural causes, my arse.

286
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,880
Oh, now what?.

287
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,760
Christ on a bike!

288
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,120
What the fucking hell happened here, sarge?.

289
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,880
This is getting more bone by the minute!

290
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:58,680
Oh, Jesus Christ. Sarge!

291
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:01,360
Right, lads -- get a grip.

292
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,160
We've got casualties to locate.

293
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:08,800
So, ditch your bergens,
salvage whatever weapons you can find...

294
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:10,680
... and stand to.

295
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:15,520
We are now up against live hostile targets.

296
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:18,840
So if LittIe Red Riding Hood shouId show up
with a bazooka and a bad attitude...

297
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,920
... I expect you to chin the bitch!

298
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:25,400
Looks Iike they got hit hard and fast.
Every magazine is full.

299
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,120
Nobody got off a single round.

300
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,760
If they lost, then where are the bodies?.

301
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,360
All right, corporal...

302
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:36,000
... get on the net and call in.
I want emergency airlift immediately!

303
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:36,040
I'm on it.

304
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:40,280
-HoIy shit!
-Contact!

305
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,360
Help me!

306
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,200
Captain!

307
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,800
Ryan?. ! What happened here?.

308
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,600
Do not tell me you fucking know him?.

309
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,640
Captain Ryan. Special Ops.

310
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,120
Not the fucking dog lover?.

311
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,480
Spearhead Patrol, this is Spearhead Patrol.

312
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:02,280
Are you receiving?.

313
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,520
He Iooks Iike he took on Jack the Ripper
and came last!

314
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:07,200
I can patch him up
but he needs a medic right now!

315
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,680
This is emergency Code 64.

316
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,800
You've gotta get me out of here!
Do you understand?.

317
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,440
There was only supposed to be one!

318
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:15,080
We're working on it, Captain!

319
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:17,240
- Sarge.
- Not now, Spoon.

320
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:18,360
Are you receiving?.

321
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,480
- Shit.
- What's wrong, Bruce?.

322
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:24,840
I can't find a signal!

323
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,400
Didn't you check it?.

324
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:30,000
Of course I checked it!
And I double checked it and it worked fine!

325
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,840
All right, Bruce, stay on it, see what you can do.

326
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Terry...

327
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:36,880
... this team must have had their own coms kit.
Have a look a round, see if you can find it. Go!

328
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:40,680
... have a shufti round the camp,
see if you can find anything else useful.

329
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,560
- Yah, but...
- Not now, Spoon!

330
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:45,440
This is Spearhead Patrol. Are you receiving me?.

331
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:50,280
There's only supposed to be one!

332
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:53,280
Jesus! Charnel House is compromised to fuck!

333
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:56,120
-Do you copy?.
-What the hell's he doing here?.

334
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,760
All I know is he's Special Forces.

335
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:02,080
But if this is part of our exercise,
they're not advertising.

336
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:05,080
No cap badge, no insignia, just tags.

337
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,840
What, you mean it's some kind
of convert action?.

338
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:07,800
Convert action or not,

339
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,200
they're packing all kind of weird shit!

340
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:12,240
Tranquillizer darts, nets...

341
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,040
... you name it.

342
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:15,600
This is less like a Special Ops mission...

343
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,680
... more like a fucking safari.

344
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:19,200
Sarge, I found their radio.

345
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,560
-Oh shit! I don't believe it!

346
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:22,160
There was only supposed to be one!

347
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,320
What's he on about, sarge?.

348
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,640
Terry, get back on stag now.

349
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:29,840
You've got to get me out of here
before they come back!

350
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:31,720
Who, captain?. Who is going to come back?.

351
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:36,160
They tore them to pieces in front of my eyes!

352
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:36,840
He's off on one, sarge!

353
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:40,040
If we don't get him somewhere warm soon,
he's gonna die of hypothermia!

354
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,560
Stay with me, captain.

355
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:43,080
Ryan, stay with me!

356
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:44,160
Not now, Spoon!

357
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:46,640
I don't know if you care but in about
half an hour it's gonna be dark.

358
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,720
Does anybody copy?.

359
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,920
-Any joy?.
-Fuses are blown.

360
00:24:58,520 --> 00:24:59,360
Can you fix it?.

361
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:04,760
Well, maybe it was fauIty or maybe some damp
got in the casing, but it's fried the circuits.

362
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,160
Well...

363
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,920
... it's useless, mate, bin it.

364
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:11,000
I also found this.

365
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:15,240
It was attached inside. Not part of the radio.

366
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,280
Look like a transmitter.

367
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,200
Why would they put a bug in our radio?.

368
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:19,960
it's the Kobayashi Maru test.

369
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,160
They've fixed it so we can't fucking win!

370
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,280
Button it, Spoon!

371
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:25,240
No, Terry, it's probably some joker didn't want.

372
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,400
Joe to hear the footy results.

373
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:28,240
Laugh?. I nearly shat!

374
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,520
Can we scrounge anything useful?.

375
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,720
Weapons, ammunition...

376
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,320
... couple of magnesium flares.

377
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,360
That's about it. The rest's fucked!

378
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:41,360
Right, Iads ditch your 80s. From here on
in the exercise is well and truly over.

379
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:43,600
Anyone not carrying Iive rounds
had better do so.

380
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,320
it won't make any difference.

381
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,760
-They won't die.
-Yeah, well...

382
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,680
-..this gives me better peace of mind, sir.

383
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:52,720
You want peace of mind...

384
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:55,960
... run for your Iives before they tear your Iegs
from under you!

385
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:58,720
Now you just shut up like a good gentleman!

386
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:00,720
You are scaring my lads.

387
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,000
What the fuck... !

388
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:05,680
Oh Christ!

389
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:12,480
- Oh, Shit!
- All right, lads grab what you can...

390
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:14,160
... head for the tree line. We're moving. Let's go.

391
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:31,960
Right, I need a volunteer for rearguard action.

392
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:34,560
-I'll do it.
-Nice one. When we're clear, you fall back.

393
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:37,040
We're gonna be there to cover you.
Right, off you go!

394
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:39,680
Bruce -- no heroics.

395
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:42,120
Right, Spoonie, you're on point!

396
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,000
Joe, help Ryan. Terry, you're up next.

397
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,560
Coop, you're with me!

398
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,360
Right, lads,

399
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,120
Iet's have it through the Iong grass!
Double time! Go!

400
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:52,160
Come on, sunshine, fucking shift it!

401
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,440
Come on!

402
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,280
Oh, shit!

403
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:14,800
Bruce. Bruce!

404
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,160
Cooper, get out of it!

405
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:44,720
lncoming!

406
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,000
Coming up on both rear flanks!

407
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:00,280
- To your rear!
-Target!

408
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:06,440
-Coming through.
-Target!

409
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,480
Keep moving!

410
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,080
Covering fire!

411
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,000
They're going for a flanking position!

412
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,240
They're cirling us!

413
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:21,320
Covering fire!

414
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,040
Coming through!

415
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:28,680
Target!

416
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:29,960
Covering fire!

417
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:34,680
Reload!

418
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,000
Fucking get out!

419
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:44,560
Just fucking leg it!

420
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:45,520
Target!

421
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:52,360
Lads!

422
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,240
On me! On me!

423
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:08,240
Stop!

424
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:30,920
Get in!

425
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:33,040
-Everybody on me!
-Hurry!

426
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:34,960
Company, fire!

427
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,120
ln! ln! ln!

428
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:39,360
Safety!

429
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:44,200
Oh, shit!

430
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,600
Just drive!

431
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:55,360
Now!

432
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,160
I'm trying!

433
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:01,320
Fucking floor it!

434
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:07,480
Joe, stab it!

435
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,080
Try reverse.

436
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:13,600
Stab it, Joe!

437
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,040
Now forward.

438
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:34,600
Everybody okay back there?.

439
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,680
Any more casualties?. Spoon?.

440
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:38,640
-No, I'm all right.
-What about Bruce?.

441
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:42,800
-Where's Bruce?.
-Bruce is gone!

442
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:43,560
He's gone!

443
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:47,960
Oh, fuck it!

444
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,520
Just hang on back there!

445
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:55,720
Thank you.

446
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:58,120
That's okay. What happened?.

447
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:02,640
What happened?. We were attacked by huge
fucking howling things! That's what!

448
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:03,280
You were lucky I found you.

449
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:04,840
I was about to give up hope.

450
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,960
You knew we were here?.

451
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,440
I heard gunfire last night.

452
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:09,880
I knew someone was out there.

453
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:12,880
If you weren't aIready in troubIe,
then you soon would be.

454
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:15,520
We are -- Two men are down.

455
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,080
Both need medical attention.

456
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:18,800
We need to dress the sarge's wounds

457
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:19,960
before we can take him too far.

458
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:23,280
There's only one farm in this glen, but...

459
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,000
... the owner are friends.

460
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,360
We can take your men there.

461
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,480
Hello.

462
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:03,280
-Nobody home?.
-I don't know where they could be.

463
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:06,680
Right.

464
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:08,520
Stand back.

465
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:43,120
Little pigs, little pigs --

466
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:45,040
we've come to nick your video!

467
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,120
You sit.

468
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,520
Sit. Sit.

469
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:44,840
You stay.

470
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,120
All clear.

471
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:13,280
-What the fuck happened back there, Copper?.
-I don't know, mate.

472
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:16,320
She might have some answers.

473
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,200
All clear upstairs.

474
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:33,880
Where the hell are we now?.

475
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,840
Home sweet home.

476
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,680
Set him down.

477
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:40,240
Spoon, get a field dressing on that wound.

478
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,920
Terry, keep an eye out front.

479
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:51,600
Come on.

480
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:52,640
Shit!

481
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:55,040
What are you doing to me?.

482
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:58,800
-Is there a teIephone here?.
-What?. No.

483
00:36:58,520 --> 00:36:59,640
Still hot, lads.

484
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,200
Wait. You can't just help yourself!

485
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:03,600
I'm chin-strap and I'm bloody starving.

486
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:04,880
I can't help myself.

487
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:10,600
It's the training, miss.
Never waste an opportunity to eat. Come on.

488
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:10,960
See...

489
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:12,680
... now look what I'm doing!

490
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:15,560
Get it down your necks, lads.

491
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,400
Hold it. Hold it.

492
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,560
Top grub. What is it?.

493
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,480
Don't know, (mate). Looks like pork.

494
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,200
Yeah, well, Ieave some for us,
you greedy mongrels!

495
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:38,360
Miss, where is the nearest phone?.

496
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:40,240
Fifty miles as the crows flies.

497
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,040
What about the nearest population centre?.

498
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:50,720
You mean a town?.

499
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:55,200
Well, Fort William but it's at Ieast
four hour drive back the way we just came.

500
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,960
Do you think your wounded can make it?.

501
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:59,520
We have to try. The sarge is in serious troubIe
if we don't.

502
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:00,680
You seem to know these roads.

503
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:02,400
-Will you take us?.
-Right now?.

504
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:05,920
Well, unIess you friends have just gone
walkabout, this place may be compromised.

505
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,760
Fine. Sooner the better.

506
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:07,760
Let's go.

507
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,880
Right. Spoon, on me.

508
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,520
Everyone eIse, hang back
till we bring the car about.

509
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:17,000
Joe, help sarge.

510
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:19,560
Terry, watch him.

511
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:20,960
Safeties off.

512
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:02,520
Don't shoot.

513
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:07,280
Don't stare back.

514
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:09,680
I can't help it.

515
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:12,800
Go!

516
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,680
Come on!

517
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:20,320
Cooper, have you gone spare or what?.

518
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:25,120
-Cooper, you radgie!
-That puts the kibosh on that plan!

519
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,160
That was my car!

520
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:33,120
Give us a fucking hand here!

521
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:37,920
Oh my God!

522
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:47,920
Fuck off!

523
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,440
Fuck that!

524
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:51,440
Stand back!

525
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:52,800
Bloody hell!

526
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,040
Go on, son!

527
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,200
What the fucking hell's happening?.

528
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,040
Terry, right flank. Cover the window!

529
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:14,200
For Christ's sake, Terry, man, get a grip!

530
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:23,040
That's bloody charming, that is!

531
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:30,640
You incompetent moron!

532
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:33,360
Do you want to have a fucking go, like?. !

533
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,120
Bathroom?.

534
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:42,400
Upstairs. Far end of passage.

535
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:45,320
We need to talk, Ryan.

536
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,760
Doesn't look like I'm going anywhere, does it?. !

537
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:50,080
Joe, Spoon, look like we're staying.

538
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:50,840
You know what to do.

539
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:53,680
I want a secure perimeter
with a clear field of fire.

540
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,800
But give them something inviting.

541
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:56,120
Right?.
-I'm on it.

542
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:00,480
Terry, are you okay?.

543
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:05,040
-I've got a reaI craving for a kebab.
-I'll take that as a yes.

544
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:06,880
Right, we've got limited ammunition.

545
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:09,560
I want you to get as many pots
and pans as you can lay your hands on...

546
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:12,040
... fill them with water and keep them
on the boil, all right?.

547
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:15,440
Terry...

548
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:18,960
... whiIe you're at it, stick the kettIe on.
We could all do with a brew.

549
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:29,400
Terry give us a hand with this.

550
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:35,760
Other side. Other side. Ah, you fool!

551
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:37,520
You came here because of them, right?.

552
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:39,560
I don't have a fucking clue what 'they' are.

553
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:41,080
And right now, I don't really care.

554
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,160
Then what are you doing here?.

555
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:45,680
This was supposed to be
a routine training exercise and that's all.

556
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:46,880
So this wasn't a rescue mission?.

557
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:48,760
No, I guess not.

558
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:52,360
Back door's secure.

559
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:53,680
What's happening here, Spoon?.

560
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:55,480
Well, they're still moving around our there...

561
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:57,720
... but they're keeping their distance,
staying within the tree line.

562
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:58,960
Maybe they've had enough for one night.

563
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:00,120
Not likely.

564
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:03,280
They're smart. You've seen what they can do.

565
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:04,000
My guess...

566
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:06,760
... is they're doing exactIy
what you'd be doing in their shoes.

567
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:09,960
They're working as a team.
Looking for a weakness, a way in.

568
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:11,360
I'm not about to second guess these things.

569
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:12,520
They're enemy, simple as that.

570
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:15,280
This is no ordinary enemy.

571
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:38,400
You know what this reminds me of?.

572
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:40,000
Rourke's Drift.

573
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:43,000
A hundred men of HarIech
making a desperate stand...

574
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:45,040
... against ten thousand Zulu warriors.

575
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:47,840
Outnumbered, surrounded...

576
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:51,160
... staring death in the face,
not flinching for a moment.

577
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:54,040
Balls of British steel.

578
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:57,400
You're bloody loving this, aren't you?.

579
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:02,280
It's totally bone -- That's all there is to say.

580
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:14,040
So, what are we talking about here, wolves?.

581
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:17,440
Not entirely wolf. Not all human,

582
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,520
but something in between.

583
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:22,000
Wolfmen?. You're having a laugh, right?.

584
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:23,960
I may be nuts but I'm not fruitcake!

585
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:27,720
Fine. Stay here and drink tea!

586
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:30,440
I thought you might be here because of them,
but I guess not.

587
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:32,080
Just don't be an arsehole!

588
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:36,320
I like your new girlfriend, Coop.

589
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:39,480
How are you feeling?.

590
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:40,600
A touch of gas.

591
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:46,960
And the fact that various body parts
are trying to vacate the premises...

592
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:48,480
... fucking awful!

593
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:56,600
- It's hot.
- Cheers.

594
00:43:58,160 --> 00:43:59,360
Heads up!

595
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:04,480
For crying out loud, man!

596
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:07,440
Short controlled bursts!

597
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:12,560
Do you have a name, soldier?.

598
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:13,640
Cooper.

599
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:16,800
Gonna need your help here, miss.

600
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,080
My name is Megan.

601
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:21,000
And I know how to kill them.

602
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:24,240
Shit, sarge, you're leaking like a sieve!

603
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:27,400
Look, I need you to get some supergIue
and some whisky, all right?.

604
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:27,880
I'll see what I can do.

605
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:29,760
-Come on.
-No, no, no...

606
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:34,360
sorry about the arsehoIe thing.
I've got a mean streak a mile across.

607
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:36,280
That's all right. It's the Ieast of my worries
right now.

608
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:38,160
Can you pass me my gun, please?.

609
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:40,000
Thank you.

610
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:44,800
Come on, Coop, up the wooden hill.

611
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:47,640
-Where are we going, Coop?.
-You don't wish to know, mate.

612
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:15,160
What's the glue for?.

613
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:17,560
Ever wondered why the best thing that

614
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:19,240
superglue sticks together is your fingers?.

615
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:21,320
-Fucking get off!
-Give it. Give it.

616
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:23,600
Forget your grandma's china cups...

617
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:28,160
... this stuff was deveIoped for the Vietnam war
to patch up broken soldiers.

618
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:31,040
How are you feeling, sarge?.

619
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:35,880
Absolutely fucking top fucking bollocks!

620
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:44,040
Are you sure he shouId be
chasing painkillers with whisky?.

621
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:44,800
Yeah, well, he's earned it.

622
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:48,040
-Is it your birthday, Coop?.
-No, mate.

623
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:48,920
Is it my birthday?.

624
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:52,800
No, but you're gonna thank us
for this in the morning.

625
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:53,360
I'll tell you something, mate,

626
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:55,800
I'm gonna fucking thank you right now.

627
00:45:56,360 --> 00:46:00,120
I'm gonna thank you because you saved my Iife.
You got me out of there, mate.

628
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:01,640
Yeah, well, you wouId have done
the same thing.

629
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:03,520
If I'd done the same fucking thing,

630
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:05,680
I would have saved Bruce -- wouldn't l?.

631
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:09,480
Yeah, fuck!

632
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:29,080
Sausages!

633
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:32,480
I'll tell you something, miss, right...

634
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:36,080
... this geezer here, right, is my best mate.

635
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:38,360
He's the salt of the fucking earth.

636
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:41,440
I mean, don't get me wrong, the rest of the
geezers in the squad, they're all right,

637
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,320
lovely fellas and stuff...

638
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:43,800
... and any single one of them could marry my...

639
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:49,760
... marry my sister -- if I had one.

640
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:57,360
I'll tell you what, I love him. I love you...

641
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:59,560
... like a mate that l... that I love.

642
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:00,720
Would you like to be alone?.

643
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:08,880
Oh, you -- dirty fucker!

644
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:10,720
Here.

645
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:15,520
-It's the adrenaIine.
-I'll stick, you bond.

646
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:18,080
I'll tell you something,
someone better get fucking stuck in soon...

647
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:19,400
... because this is really starting to hurt!

648
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:25,560
-What's up?.
-Cooper, knock me out. Hit me!

649
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:29,360
Oh you fucking pussy, hit me...

650
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:39,080
Go, go.

651
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:55,120
-So, how Iong have you Iived round here?.
-Two years.

652
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:56,840
Came here for wildlife.

653
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:00,040
I'm a zoologist.

654
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:02,320
So, you've heard those stories as well then.

655
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:06,280
Yeah, I heard the stories, I went Iooking,
I found evidence.

656
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:09,800
-I was fascinated by the possibiIity that...
-You can't seriously believe in werewolves?.

657
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:12,680
Straight out of college, I'd have Iaughed
at the suggestion, but now...

658
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:15,200
... I know they're as real as you and me.

659
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,280
Before tonight is over, you will too.

660
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:24,920
There -- I think that will hold.

661
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:28,120
-You done this before?.
-Oh, yeah.

662
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:30,680
We gIue peopIe's gut together
all the time out here.

663
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:40,640
Everyone tooled up?.

664
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:42,160
To the nines.

665
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:48,160
You'll have a fucking eye out with that, lad.

666
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:51,400
Right, Terry, look sharp!

667
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:53,800
The rest of you...

668
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:56,760
... I know things have gone from shit to bone...

669
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:59,080
... to worse in the last twenty four hours, but...

670
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:01,080
... if we pull our weight and do the job...

671
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:03,360
...we still have a fighting chance.
No more running.

672
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:06,400
We stand, here. We fight.

673
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:09,960
Right?. -- Any questions?.

674
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:13,720
Oh, just the one, Coop.
Exactly what is it we're fighting against?.

675
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:15,600
Megan?. You want to run it past the boys?.

676
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:17,480
-Lycanthropes.
-You what?.

677
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:18,960
That's werewolves to you and me.

678
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:24,400
-You're taking the piss?.
-What?. Makes perfect sense to me!

679
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:25,320
What, you mean like full moons,

680
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:27,200
siIver bullets and eyebrows
that join in the middle?.

681
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:29,120
Before you dismiss it offhand,

682
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:30,800
think about what you've seen and heard.

683
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:32,320
The full moon, the teeth...

684
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:35,960
... the cIaws, the howIing.
Is it so difficult to believe?.

685
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:38,000
For a whole year now...

686
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:39,400
... I've tracked these things.

687
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:42,040
I've studied them. Tried to understand them.

688
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:44,280
Ever month, when the moon is full...

689
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:47,720
... they hunt as a team. Dedicated to the kill.

690
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:51,080
During that time, at Ieast fifteen peopIe
have vanished.

691
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:53,720
Hikers mostly. In small groups or alone.

692
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:56,240
They're caught out in the open, hunted down,

693
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,800
torn apart and devoured.

694
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:02,440
I've never witness the actuaI sIaughter,
but the next day...

695
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:06,680
... no bodies, no werewolves -- just blood.

696
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:09,320
The eyebrow's thing is nonsense.

697
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:12,640
It's just Dark Age paranoia. And silver bullets...

698
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:14,320
... no-one's ever get close enough to try.

699
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,000
I'm sold.

700
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:18,440
Slow down, Spoon, but Megan may have a point.

701
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:19,240
I'm still not convinced

702
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:22,000
that these things didn't just escape
from the local nuthouse...

703
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:24,000
... and forget to shave or trim their nails.

704
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:25,760
But they're out there and we're in here.

705
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:27,080
What they may or may not be...

706
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:29,600
... does not affect our immediate situation
one bit.

707
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:30,560
This is bone.

708
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:32,960
This is so fucking bone!

709
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:33,800
Anything else?.

710
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:35,880
Yeah, what does bone mean?.

711
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:37,640
Bone - bollocks. Naff.

712
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:38,560
Not very good.

713
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:41,440
Right. Anything else I should know?.

714
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:45,640
Call-signs. If you need to be specific.

715
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:49,320
Upstairs, you've got Sergeant Wells
who you seem to know inside and out by now.

716
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:50,200
You've got Spoon over there.

717
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:51,880
The vomiting cavalier, Terry.

718
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:54,280
The big guy with the axe is Joe.

719
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:56,720
Didn't you forget someone?.

720
00:50:58,440 --> 00:50:59,360
Ryan.

721
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:02,120
Captain Ryan is not one of our team.

722
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:07,840
His being here is hazy at best.

723
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:09,000
If I could tell you, I would.

724
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:15,600
But I'm just a soldier -- like you.

725
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:18,280
No stripes -- no insignia.

726
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:21,600
A suit in a uniform does not make a soldier.

727
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:22,480
He's with Special Ops.

728
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:27,320
His team were wiped out Iast night.
He was the only survivor.

729
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:31,120
I'd advise you against pursuing
this line of questioning, Private Cooper.

730
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:32,960
Are you pulling ranks on me now, captain?.

731
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:34,720
You can shove that right up your arse!

732
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:38,920
I'm saying my being here is a most point...

733
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:42,040
... since I'm now in as much shit as you are.

734
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:43,280
We're all in the same fucking shit.

735
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:45,040
And we need each other.

736
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:46,760
I doubt I need you.

737
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:48,720
You bloody did two hours ago!

738
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:50,560
The Uaths.

739
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:51,960
Crying like a baby, you were.

740
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:54,440
That was then. Circumstances change.

741
00:51:54,760 --> 00:51:55,520
What?.

742
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:56,960
Uath - it's Celtic.

743
00:51:57,640 --> 00:51:59,640
The family has lived in this glen for centuries.

744
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:03,720
So, what was he doing out there?.

745
00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:04,680
I have an idea.

746
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:08,000
But I want to hear it from the horse's mouth.

747
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:11,000
Come to think of it, Ryan, how are you feeling?.

748
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:11,600
I'm fine.

749
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:13,280
When we found you,

750
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:15,840
you couId bareIy open your eyes,
let alone walk...

751
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:18,440
... and then later, you managed to run...

752
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:21,520
... and now Iook at you -
fighting fit and sitting pretty.

753
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,800
Hardly the behaviour of a man who...

754
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:25,880
... until recently, was knocking on death's door.

755
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:28,120
I have a strong constitution.

756
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:29,520
You're not bloody kidding!

757
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:33,000
Then you won't mind if I have a Iook
at that wound of yours.

758
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:34,080
I'd just as soon you didn't.

759
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:36,720
I have a responsibility to my patient.

760
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:38,640
I'm warning you, Cooper, don't touch me!

761
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:40,880
Get back!

762
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:58,640
Tie him up. I want him to talk.

763
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:03,120
-What are you gonna do, torture him?.
-Don't know.

764
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:06,920
-What wouId you do?.
-I'd torture him.

765
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:12,320
What now?. !

766
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:15,040
They've shut down the generator.
-Why would they do that?.

767
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:16,160
Because they can see in the dark.

768
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:17,440
And you're afraid of it.

769
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:19,560
This is a pile of rancid shit!

770
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:20,720
Now what do you believe?.

771
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,240
I'm beginning to believe you,

772
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:24,400
but I think Joe might have worded it better.

773
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:26,320
They're on the move!

774
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,480
All right this is it!

775
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:32,280
Mark your targets and preserve your ammo.

776
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:33,800
Three round bursts.

777
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:36,600
We've only got one stun grenade apiece...

778
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:40,400
... so only use them if absolutely necessary.

779
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:46,040
-Stand to.
-Come on then.

780
00:53:48,040 --> 00:53:49,920
-What can I do?.
-What do you want to do?.

781
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:51,600
Run and hide. I know what's coming.

782
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:53,080
Take care of Sam.

783
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:56,840
Keep an eye on Ryan.
If he tries anything, pan him.

784
00:53:57,080 --> 00:53:59,800
Chasing that first kiss, are we, Cooper?.

785
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:03,800
It's as simple as this.

786
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:06,120
If you're not there for us...

787
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:08,040
... we're not here for you.

788
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:02,160
Contact!

789
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:08,040
Die!

790
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:43,000
Spoon, get down!

791
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:48,040
Fucking back!

792
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:03,320
Fuck!

793
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:11,120
Fire in the hole!

794
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:17,000
Cooper!
... Hurry!

795
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:28,760
Cheers, mate.

796
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:35,360
Sarge.

797
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:43,560
Cooper!

798
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,320
Sarge!... Sarge!

799
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:02,800
Bastard!

800
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:06,080
Sarge, wake up!

801
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:07,840
Fucking wake up, you bastard!

802
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:14,400
Sarge!
Say 'cheese', you fucker!

803
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:15,000
Wake up!

804
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:20,440
Fuck! Sarge!

805
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:08,280
Dogs?. More like pussies!

806
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:30,160
You all right?.

807
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:33,120
Oh, yeah, yeah, I'm peachy, mate.

808
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:44,520
Coop...squad's yours, mate.

809
01:00:07,640 --> 01:00:09,040
They took Terry.

810
01:00:11,720 --> 01:00:13,520
Then we go and get him back!

811
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:14,600
Too fucking right!

812
01:00:14,560 --> 01:00:15,600
Forget about him.

813
01:00:23,320 --> 01:00:24,280
What did you say?.

814
01:00:25,640 --> 01:00:27,680
He's dead, Cooper, and you know it.

815
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:32,520
Shit!

816
01:00:42,320 --> 01:00:44,320
Somebody must have heard some gunfire!

817
01:00:44,680 --> 01:00:47,120
-Somebody must have heard something!
-Who?.

818
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:51,600
The onIy other house within fifty miIes
of here is mine. And l', not there!

819
01:00:50,920 --> 01:00:53,120
Well, what about the road, man?. Passers-by?.

820
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:54,920
Do you have any idea what kind of luck you had

821
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:56,000
running into me out there tonight?.

822
01:00:56,040 --> 01:00:57,760
I thought you ran into us?.

823
01:00:59,240 --> 01:01:00,440
Joe, check upstairs.

824
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:07,440
Even if anyone did come by,
they would only end up...

825
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:08,720
... lambs for the slaughter like you.

826
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:11,520
Our only hope is daylight.

827
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:13,640
The sun rises in six hours.

828
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:16,200
We did the best we could.

829
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:19,720
But if the sarge's condition deteriorates...

830
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:21,400
... he'll have less than four.

831
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:23,720
And the only thing holding them back...

832
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:25,640
... is they don't know how much ammunition
we have left.

833
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:36,680
Let's have a look at that.

834
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:42,840
Tell me. Honestly, what are our chances?.

835
01:01:43,480 --> 01:01:46,200
Morale seems good, considering.

836
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:47,760
But that will only last

837
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:49,240
as long as the ammunition holds out.

838
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:53,440
High spirits are just no substitute
of eight hundred rounds a minute...

839
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:54,320
... but I don't think that's what
you wanted to hear.

840
01:01:56,880 --> 01:02:00,160
Think about it, Cooper - up until today...

841
01:01:59,640 --> 01:02:03,440
... you beIieve there was a Iine
between myth and reality.

842
01:02:03,640 --> 01:02:05,560
May have been a very fine line sometimes,

843
01:02:05,360 --> 01:02:07,400
but -- at least there was a line.

844
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:11,480
Those things out there are real.

845
01:02:13,080 --> 01:02:14,720
And if they're real, what else is real?.

846
01:02:17,120 --> 01:02:19,240
You know what lives in the shadows now.

847
01:02:20,560 --> 01:02:22,960
You may never get another night's sIeep
as long as you live.

848
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:27,280
So, why worry, Cooper?.
You may not live that long.

849
01:02:27,120 --> 01:02:28,080
Shut your mouth!

850
01:02:30,600 --> 01:02:32,360
We are gonna make it through this.
You know why?.

851
01:02:33,400 --> 01:02:34,680
I don't scare that easy.

852
01:02:39,400 --> 01:02:40,240
Here.

853
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:43,360
It's supposed to be lucky.

854
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:45,000
For me, or the rest of the rabbit?.

855
01:02:46,040 --> 01:02:47,840
-You'll need a lot more than luck this time.

856
01:02:47,640 --> 01:02:48,760
Shut up, Ryan!

857
01:02:50,520 --> 01:02:51,400
Listen to me, Cooper...

858
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:54,160
... ignore him. We can survive till sunrise.

859
01:02:53,720 --> 01:02:54,680
That's all that matters.

860
01:02:54,600 --> 01:02:55,800
-It's just a few more hours.

861
01:02:55,800 --> 01:02:57,560
Wait a minute. Am I missing something here?.

862
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:03,960
I know him.

863
01:03:05,360 --> 01:03:07,000
I was seconded to his team

864
01:03:06,920 --> 01:03:08,360
during their first visit here.

865
01:03:08,800 --> 01:03:12,200
First visit?. What first visit?.
What the fuck are you talking about?.

866
01:03:11,720 --> 01:03:13,480
They came to check out the stories.

867
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:14,600
They needed an expert.

868
01:03:15,600 --> 01:03:17,640
It's just a few more hours, Cooper.

869
01:03:17,360 --> 01:03:18,320
That's all it is.

870
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:20,920
All clear?.

871
01:03:21,080 --> 01:03:23,320
-Yeah.
-You wanna kill them all?.

872
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:26,080
-Yes.
-Good. Keep it up.

873
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:29,080
What's the damage, Spoon?.

874
01:03:29,160 --> 01:03:31,040
Well, we might have pissed on our chips.

875
01:03:31,360 --> 01:03:33,560
We've only got two full mags for MP5s...

876
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:34,840
... six rounds for the shotgun...

877
01:03:34,920 --> 01:03:37,880
... and one spare, just in case.

878
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:40,200
Stay sharp, everyone.

879
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:33,920
We were putting fire down all over.

880
01:04:33,720 --> 01:04:37,720
I mean, we filled those things with Iead and they
just kept on getting up and coming back at us.

881
01:04:37,960 --> 01:04:40,120
Sixty rounds, man, ain't gonna last two minutes.

882
01:04:40,440 --> 01:04:43,560
So, either we all make a break for it
and fight our way clear or...

883
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,360
... or the rest of us keep them occupied

884
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:46,600
while one of us goes for help.

885
01:04:46,520 --> 01:04:47,640
And by the time the cavalry get here...

886
01:04:48,600 --> 01:04:51,440
... they'll have to pick what's Ieft of us
from between their fucking teeth!

887
01:05:02,800 --> 01:05:04,800
Fucking brilliant!

888
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:07,960
We either stay and snuff it or we all go --

889
01:05:09,080 --> 01:05:10,400
and snuff it!

890
01:05:10,680 --> 01:05:13,280
Decisions, decisions.

891
01:05:13,080 --> 01:05:14,120
Laugh?.

892
01:05:15,040 --> 01:05:17,320
-I nearIy died.
-Who's stopping you?.

893
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:18,320
Right, that's it!

894
01:05:18,320 --> 01:05:19,560
We'll fucking have him!

895
01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:21,440
Take it easy, big man. Calm down.

896
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:24,880
Do any of you know how to hot-wire a car?.
What?.

897
01:05:24,920 --> 01:05:26,880
They keep an old Land Rover in the barn.

898
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:28,000
I don't know where the keys are...

899
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:29,760
... but if one of you couId break in and start it,
then...

900
01:05:30,680 --> 01:05:31,720
I can do that.

901
01:05:33,640 --> 01:05:35,440
-Are you sure?.
-Piece of piss!

902
01:05:36,280 --> 01:05:39,400
Anyway, the further I am from this wanker,
the happier I'll be.

903
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:43,280
All right you're gonna need a decoy.

904
01:05:43,800 --> 01:05:45,320
Something fast and loud.

905
01:05:52,840 --> 01:05:55,720
What?. You what?.

906
01:06:00,760 --> 01:06:05,080
You sit. Stay.

907
01:06:13,240 --> 01:06:16,520
-You're serious about this werewoIf thing,
aren't you?. -I'm afraid so.

908
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:18,960
Shit.

909
01:06:20,440 --> 01:06:22,320
Don't suppose you know who won the match.

910
01:06:22,240 --> 01:06:23,800
Didn't even know there was a game on.

911
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:25,840
It's not a game.

912
01:06:25,880 --> 01:06:26,800
Right, this is it.

913
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:27,920
Everyone get ready.

914
01:06:28,800 --> 01:06:29,640
Bollocks.

915
01:06:37,560 --> 01:06:42,160
Joe good luck, mate.

916
01:06:41,840 --> 01:06:43,080
You don't get off the hook that easy.

917
01:07:15,640 --> 01:07:18,080
All right, you bastards...

918
01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:25,520
... come and have a go
if you think you're hard enough!

919
01:07:36,320 --> 01:07:39,520
Well, come on, you beauties!

920
01:07:44,800 --> 01:07:46,000
They took the bait!

921
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:54,640
Come on!

922
01:07:54,320 --> 01:07:55,560
Spoon, run!

923
01:08:08,800 --> 01:08:10,880
Move your fucking arse, soldier!

924
01:08:12,360 --> 01:08:13,280
Come on!

925
01:08:13,720 --> 01:08:14,680
I'm trying!

926
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:17,320
Pull us!

927
01:08:25,200 --> 01:08:27,720
I love it when a posh bird talks dirty!

928
01:08:32,640 --> 01:08:33,440
Jesus!

929
01:08:34,400 --> 01:08:35,720
Fucking what's happening, Cooper?. !

930
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:37,960
Fucking cut it!

931
01:08:38,480 --> 01:08:39,400
Get back!

932
01:08:42,520 --> 01:08:43,400
Cut it!

933
01:08:43,400 --> 01:08:46,800
-Cut it!
-Fucking thing!

934
01:08:47,200 --> 01:08:47,920
Cut it!

935
01:09:19,120 --> 01:09:19,880
Shit!

936
01:09:32,520 --> 01:09:35,400
He's done it! Ryan, up!
Everyone else, downstairs.

937
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:37,160
-Come on, move it! Come on!
-All right, Coop!

938
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:39,600
Move. Move.

939
01:09:48,600 --> 01:09:50,400
You're behind me, aren't you?.

940
01:09:56,240 --> 01:09:58,520
I'm gonna fucking have you!

941
01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:06,760
Come on.

942
01:10:10,320 --> 01:10:12,360
Ready?. Go, go!

943
01:10:15,560 --> 01:10:16,520
Back!

944
01:12:47,320 --> 01:12:50,600
-Well?.
-She's in a bad way. Fuel pump's gone...

945
01:12:50,480 --> 01:12:54,000
... fan beIt's buggered and she's pissing out
petrol like there's no tomorrow.

946
01:12:53,920 --> 01:12:55,360
The word 'bone' springs to mind.

947
01:12:56,920 --> 01:12:58,120
Joe's body?.

948
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:00,560
It's gone.

949
01:13:05,160 --> 01:13:06,360
What's the damage, Spoon?.

950
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:09,320
We're down to forty-eight rounds.

951
01:13:09,280 --> 01:13:10,240
Check the right.

952
01:13:13,160 --> 01:13:15,680
Well, Ryan -- you heard the score.

953
01:13:16,160 --> 01:13:18,200
Maybe one or two of us
are gonna make it through this...

954
01:13:18,360 --> 01:13:20,400
... but I don't care much for our chances.

955
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:22,640
You like football?.

956
01:13:23,040 --> 01:13:25,760
What?. "They think it's all over"...

957
01:13:25,440 --> 01:13:26,600
... and all that crap?.

958
01:13:27,200 --> 01:13:28,160
No, I don't.

959
01:13:28,200 --> 01:13:29,560
Well, Joe... you remember Joe?.

960
01:13:29,960 --> 01:13:32,960
He liked football. Fucking lived for it.

961
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:34,120
Is this relevant?.

962
01:13:34,400 --> 01:13:37,760
He missed the most important match
of his life for this bullshit exercise...

963
01:13:37,160 --> 01:13:39,560
... and now he's dead
along with two other mates...

964
01:13:39,200 --> 01:13:41,680
... that I'd have readily given my right arm for!

965
01:13:41,320 --> 01:13:43,880
Too fucking right it's relevant!

966
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,680
You just can't get past the dog, can you?.

967
01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:50,520
We're Iosing, Ryan. We're three-niI down
and we're close to the final whistle.

968
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:52,560
At the very least, I want to even the score.

969
01:13:55,640 --> 01:13:57,400
I understand your resentment.

970
01:13:58,600 --> 01:13:59,800
But you failed

971
01:13:59,680 --> 01:14:02,680
because you weren't prepared
to take that extra step.

972
01:14:03,640 --> 01:14:06,000
If you'd passed, you wouId have been
on my team...

973
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:08,640
... and if you were on my team, you'd be dead.

974
01:14:08,360 --> 01:14:12,200
Yeah, I failed, and I'm bloody glad of it.

975
01:14:11,880 --> 01:14:14,960
Because given the choice of taking orders
from a toffee-nosed twat like you...

976
01:14:14,720 --> 01:14:16,920
... and slogging it out with these guys -

977
01:14:16,720 --> 01:14:18,360
I'll take the underdogs any time.

978
01:14:18,200 --> 01:14:21,080
So you can take your precious seIection,
shove it up your arse...

979
01:14:20,720 --> 01:14:23,600
... and stop trying to change the fucking subject!

980
01:14:32,720 --> 01:14:33,840
Fair enough.

981
01:14:35,200 --> 01:14:37,120
But you won't like what I have to tell you.

982
01:14:37,640 --> 01:14:40,440
There are some places you really shouldn't go.

983
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:42,560
We'll be the judge of that, Ryan.

984
01:14:45,240 --> 01:14:47,640
Ever heard of Special Weapons Division?.

985
01:14:49,040 --> 01:14:50,480
They're the men in white coats

986
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:53,560
who trains doIphins
to stick mines on submarines...

987
01:14:53,240 --> 01:14:54,520
... and cute furry animals

988
01:14:54,400 --> 01:14:56,400
to tear your head off at the neck.

989
01:14:57,760 --> 01:15:01,000
They saw an opportunity and called me in.

990
01:15:00,760 --> 01:15:03,280
To do what?. Catch one of these things?.

991
01:15:02,960 --> 01:15:06,160
And to bring it back - alive, if possible.

992
01:15:05,880 --> 01:15:07,680
Only 'it' turned out to be 'them'.

993
01:15:08,320 --> 01:15:11,360
-We underestimated enemy numbers.
-Underestimated?.

994
01:15:11,080 --> 01:15:13,040
I'd have a serious word with your head sheds

995
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:14,560
about the quality of their intelligence.

996
01:15:14,360 --> 01:15:17,200
It may have been their invitation,
but it was my party.

997
01:15:16,840 --> 01:15:18,680
I planned and executed it.

998
01:15:18,440 --> 01:15:19,880
You mean you loused it up.

999
01:15:22,840 --> 01:15:26,120
We lost good men, Ryan. Yours...

1000
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:27,200
... and mine.

1001
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:31,760
I wanna know...

1002
01:15:34,560 --> 01:15:36,080
... where we fit in.

1003
01:15:36,440 --> 01:15:39,560
The reality is you're expendable.

1004
01:15:40,200 --> 01:15:43,440
And I had approval to put you at risk.

1005
01:15:45,440 --> 01:15:47,560
Get to the fucking point, Ryan.

1006
01:15:49,560 --> 01:15:51,880
I made a gap in enemy lines.

1007
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:54,240
You were good enough to spot it...

1008
01:15:54,080 --> 01:15:59,000
... and predictabIe enough to go for it.
That was your bait.

1009
01:15:58,560 --> 01:15:59,840
You were mine.

1010
01:16:05,560 --> 01:16:06,560
You bastard!

1011
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:08,080
I had to choose somebody.

1012
01:16:08,640 --> 01:16:09,600
I remembered you.

1013
01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:12,560
Monkey see, monkey do.

1014
01:16:14,920 --> 01:16:16,480
They were my men!

1015
01:16:16,560 --> 01:16:18,440
Get up, you shit. You know what we can do.

1016
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:19,440
Give us a fighting chance.

1017
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:22,120
Live and learn, Cooper.

1018
01:16:28,160 --> 01:16:29,520
I didn't hit him that hard.

1019
01:16:30,640 --> 01:16:32,040
You shook something loose.

1020
01:17:05,960 --> 01:17:07,200
Bad dog.

1021
01:17:12,440 --> 01:17:13,480
Fetch!

1022
01:17:14,280 --> 01:17:15,400
Bag the shot!

1023
01:17:18,920 --> 01:17:20,000
Clear!

1024
01:17:20,720 --> 01:17:22,080
Get off!

1025
01:17:23,240 --> 01:17:24,480
Cooper, get down!

1026
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:25,800
I've got target!

1027
01:17:46,920 --> 01:17:50,400
WerewoIves spend most of the time
in human form, right?.

1028
01:17:50,960 --> 01:17:54,200
And the onIy peopIe from miIes around
live right here.

1029
01:17:55,080 --> 01:17:57,560
So these things aren't about
to give up the fight and go home.

1030
01:17:57,440 --> 01:18:00,320
-They are home. -Yeah, well,
that makes perfect sense, doesn't it?.

1031
01:18:01,160 --> 01:18:02,120
I mean, think about it -

1032
01:18:02,040 --> 01:18:03,120
we bust into their house,

1033
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:04,960
we eat all their porridge
we sleep in their fucking beds.

1034
01:18:05,800 --> 01:18:07,000
no wonder they're pissed off.

1035
01:18:07,040 --> 01:18:09,280
But they're good people, they're kind people.

1036
01:18:09,240 --> 01:18:10,440
-More's a pity.
-Why?.

1037
01:18:11,480 --> 01:18:12,720
Because we're gonna have to kill them all.

1038
01:18:12,840 --> 01:18:13,840
Too right, mate.

1039
01:18:34,160 --> 01:18:35,800
What self-respecting werewolf would have

1040
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:37,280
anything silver in the house anyway?.

1041
01:18:37,440 --> 01:18:38,640
Yeah, well, fuck the folklore

1042
01:18:38,520 --> 01:18:39,440
It's just burn them.

1043
01:18:39,880 --> 01:18:41,120
If we knew where to find them.

1044
01:18:41,160 --> 01:18:41,920
Maybe we do.

1045
01:18:43,400 --> 01:18:45,000
Everything we've seen so far suggests

1046
01:18:44,760 --> 01:18:45,880
the behaviour of a pack.

1047
01:18:46,280 --> 01:18:49,360
Six to eight members,
an Alpha pair leading the subordinates...

1048
01:18:49,120 --> 01:18:50,680
... and a young male, a beta wolf,

1049
01:18:50,480 --> 01:18:52,360
second in command, Makes sense.

1050
01:18:53,400 --> 01:18:54,400
No, you lost me.

1051
01:18:54,760 --> 01:18:58,600
A woIf pack sticks together.
Generally somewhere close to its food supply.

1052
01:18:58,280 --> 01:19:00,080
Somewhere safe, sheltered --

1053
01:19:00,800 --> 01:19:02,520
and warm.

1054
01:19:07,680 --> 01:19:10,360
You're gonna have to move
like shit off a shovel on this one, mate.

1055
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:11,600
You worry about your own shit, all right?.

1056
01:19:11,800 --> 01:19:14,720
When we bIow that fuse that pIace is gonna
go up like Zabriskie Point.

1057
01:19:14,720 --> 01:19:17,120
-Just make it work.
-Yeah, it's easy-peasy.

1058
01:19:16,920 --> 01:19:18,120
Yeah, lemon squeezy.

1059
01:19:18,840 --> 01:19:25,080
Listen, Coop... what about the sarge?.

1060
01:19:25,800 --> 01:19:27,040
What about the sarge?.

1061
01:19:28,120 --> 01:19:29,400
You know what I mean.

1062
01:19:34,160 --> 01:19:35,600
Sarge is with us.

1063
01:19:36,480 --> 01:19:38,760
Yeah, I just didn't want him to go

1064
01:19:38,680 --> 01:19:39,840
without getting his watch back.

1065
01:19:49,160 --> 01:19:52,000
You -- stay out of trouble.

1066
01:20:06,040 --> 01:20:07,400
You all right?.

1067
01:20:09,840 --> 01:20:12,800
Oh, yeah, yeah, I'm fine -- Cooper.

1068
01:20:13,840 --> 01:20:15,120
I mean, I feel...

1069
01:20:15,920 --> 01:20:18,000
... absolutely fantastic.

1070
01:20:21,040 --> 01:20:24,200
I mean, that's the problem, isn't it --eh?.

1071
01:20:28,560 --> 01:20:29,680
What if she's wrong?.

1072
01:20:32,080 --> 01:20:34,400
What if they're not all in there, eh?.

1073
01:20:35,280 --> 01:20:36,720
Then we only get some of them.

1074
01:20:37,680 --> 01:20:39,480
It's a shit-load better than none of them...

1075
01:20:39,440 --> 01:20:41,920
... and marked improvement on all of us.

1076
01:20:41,680 --> 01:20:43,080
No, no, no, you listen to me.

1077
01:20:42,880 --> 01:20:45,160
You get the fuck out now.

1078
01:20:45,280 --> 01:20:47,680
I hoId them back, I keep them occupied
and you get out!

1079
01:20:48,760 --> 01:20:51,320
We've Iost enough men for on night,
don't you think?.

1080
01:20:52,800 --> 01:20:53,880
Let me show you something.

1081
01:20:57,880 --> 01:21:01,160
Now do not tell me that that is fucking normal.

1082
01:21:04,480 --> 01:21:09,360
What happened to Ryan is happening to me.

1083
01:21:08,640 --> 01:21:10,480
It's just a matter of time, mate.

1084
01:21:10,600 --> 01:21:13,240
Yeah, well, stop wasting time
with this hara-kiri crap.

1085
01:21:13,840 --> 01:21:15,080
This fight isn't lost yet.

1086
01:21:15,760 --> 01:21:19,760
With Ryan it onIy took a coupIe of hours, mate.
It's a full moon.

1087
01:21:20,600 --> 01:21:24,240
I mean, I dunno, maybe it's Iike
when you need to take a piss or something.

1088
01:21:23,720 --> 01:21:25,640
When you gotta go, you gotta fucking go.

1089
01:21:25,440 --> 01:21:26,960
Or maybe it's more like needing a shite.

1090
01:21:28,520 --> 01:21:32,040
Just because you need one doesn't mean
you drop your legs and pinch one off.

1091
01:21:34,960 --> 01:21:36,160
Anyway, fuck Ryan.

1092
01:21:36,480 --> 01:21:39,440
Shifty bastard couId've been
one of those things from the start.

1093
01:21:39,280 --> 01:21:42,600
You know, Coop, there's one more thing
you gotta learn about command, mate.

1094
01:21:45,680 --> 01:21:49,960
Sometimes the peopIe that you kill --
are your own men.

1095
01:21:51,560 --> 01:21:55,840
So I'm asking you let me take care of myself.

1096
01:21:58,520 --> 01:21:59,880
And at least spare you the...

1097
01:22:00,400 --> 01:22:05,680
... unfortunate business of trying to expIain to
Annie why you had to incinerate me.

1098
01:22:05,080 --> 01:22:08,960
We are gonna knock seven coIours of shit
out of these fuckers, we need you.

1099
01:22:09,480 --> 01:22:11,080
It's all right, you know, mate.

1100
01:22:11,720 --> 01:22:12,880
It's okay.

1101
01:22:14,840 --> 01:22:17,720
I just didn't make it out this time, that's all.

1102
01:22:19,080 --> 01:22:21,040
It goes with the job, do you know what I mean?.

1103
01:22:20,840 --> 01:22:25,520
When I signed my Iife away on that dotted Iine,
I fucking meant it!

1104
01:22:25,840 --> 01:22:28,320
I am a professional soldier!

1105
01:22:35,880 --> 01:22:37,440
So, what do you want me to do?.

1106
01:22:41,240 --> 01:22:42,960
Roast their bollocks off.

1107
01:22:45,560 --> 01:22:46,360
All clear.

1108
01:22:49,040 --> 01:22:50,160
Good luck.

1109
01:23:32,600 --> 01:23:34,320
Light it!

1110
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:37,280
Shit!

1111
01:23:42,160 --> 01:23:43,720
Sarge!

1112
01:24:37,840 --> 01:24:38,880
I'm sorry.

1113
01:24:46,960 --> 01:24:49,120
When I found you out there tonight...

1114
01:24:48,840 --> 01:24:52,160
... I truIy beIieved you were the best chance
I had of getting out.

1115
01:24:53,080 --> 01:24:55,280
But now we have no chance.

1116
01:24:55,680 --> 01:24:56,880
There is no out.

1117
01:24:58,280 --> 01:24:59,080
There never was.

1118
01:25:01,560 --> 01:25:03,840
I came here to be at one with nature -

1119
01:25:03,480 --> 01:25:04,520
well, I got what I wanted.

1120
01:25:05,640 --> 01:25:07,120
Now I have to live with it.

1121
01:25:11,160 --> 01:25:15,600
-There isn't a house in the next gIen.
-No.

1122
01:25:18,560 --> 01:25:20,960
And there were no werewoIves in the barn
when I blew.

1123
01:25:21,240 --> 01:25:22,200
Not one.

1124
01:25:25,600 --> 01:25:27,920
And the reason you're not in the photograph
is because you took it.

1125
01:25:27,880 --> 01:25:29,080
I never meant to...

1126
01:25:30,560 --> 01:25:35,040
New woman -- same old shit.

1127
01:25:34,400 --> 01:25:37,040
Being nice to women
will get you nowhere, Cooper.

1128
01:25:37,520 --> 01:25:40,240
Being nice to me will get you killed.

1129
01:25:42,240 --> 01:25:44,120
You may think they're all bitches, but...

1130
01:25:46,160 --> 01:25:48,040
... I'm the real thing.

1131
01:25:57,440 --> 01:26:00,880
Do you think I Iike being part
of this fucked up family?.

1132
01:26:00,680 --> 01:26:03,560
Do you think I chose to run with the pack?.

1133
01:26:03,400 --> 01:26:07,200
No. I chose you.

1134
01:26:07,280 --> 01:26:10,160
But now you're out of luck, and I'm out of time.

1135
01:26:11,080 --> 01:26:15,240
And all we can do is let nature take its course.

1136
01:26:15,880 --> 01:26:17,200
They were always here...

1137
01:26:17,240 --> 01:26:18,520
... I just unlocked the door.

1138
01:26:19,520 --> 01:26:21,240
It's that time of the month.

1139
01:26:38,400 --> 01:26:40,320
Somebody had to put it out of its misery.

1140
01:26:40,160 --> 01:26:41,440
Come on, Spoon!

1141
01:26:41,440 --> 01:26:42,440
Get clear!

1142
01:26:44,800 --> 01:26:46,040
Spoonie, stop fucking about!

1143
01:26:46,040 --> 01:26:47,440
Fucking shift it, that's an order!

1144
01:26:49,080 --> 01:26:50,280
Oh, shit!

1145
01:27:15,880 --> 01:27:16,880
Shit!

1146
01:27:24,440 --> 01:27:25,760
Come on!

1147
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:38,280
Sarge?.

1148
01:27:46,080 --> 01:27:47,240
Sarge?.

1149
01:27:48,760 --> 01:27:49,960
I'm in the carzey.

1150
01:27:51,560 --> 01:27:53,040
I'm in the carzey.

1151
01:27:57,200 --> 01:27:58,640
Come on!

1152
01:28:28,840 --> 01:28:30,680
Oh Jesus! Shit!

1153
01:30:22,120 --> 01:30:23,800
Go on, Coop! Get stuck in, mate!

1154
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:41,120
Get out of it!

1155
01:30:41,560 --> 01:30:43,520
Come on, you fucker!

1156
01:30:47,440 --> 01:30:50,120
Come on, come on!

1157
01:31:33,360 --> 01:31:37,320
-Cooper, Let's get in the wardrobe, son.
-What?.

1158
01:31:37,040 --> 01:31:39,360
-Let's get in the wardrobe.
-Yeah, all right.

1159
01:31:45,480 --> 01:31:46,640
What's that smell?.

1160
01:31:47,200 --> 01:31:48,240
I dunno.

1161
01:31:53,840 --> 01:31:55,480
Fucking hell!

1162
01:31:57,640 --> 01:31:59,640
Give me your gun.

1163
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,000
Open your mouth, watch your ears,

1164
01:32:03,880 --> 01:32:04,880
mind your toes!

1165
01:32:10,920 --> 01:32:12,600
Go! Go on!

1166
01:32:25,600 --> 01:32:26,760
Where's Spoon?. !

1167
01:32:31,480 --> 01:32:32,520
There is no Spoon.

1168
01:32:33,840 --> 01:32:38,040
-No, you fucking bastards!
-Help me, Cooper.

1169
01:32:56,560 --> 01:32:59,760
-Get in there. Get in there!
-Sam.

1170
01:33:02,200 --> 01:33:03,480
What are you doing?. !

1171
01:33:03,560 --> 01:33:04,440
-Here, take this.

1172
01:33:04,680 --> 01:33:06,920
There's one in the chamber, mate.
I'm fucking binned!

1173
01:33:06,960 --> 01:33:10,480
No, No...
We go together or we don't fucking go!

1174
01:33:10,040 --> 01:33:13,520
That's my Iast order to you, Do not fuck about.
Do not disobey me!

1175
01:33:12,960 --> 01:33:14,400
Come here, you fucking...

1176
01:33:14,960 --> 01:33:18,080
Listen to me, you have got
to make it out alive.

1177
01:33:17,880 --> 01:33:19,280
It happened. Prove it happened!

1178
01:33:19,640 --> 01:33:22,360
Not just for me or my lads...

1179
01:33:24,440 --> 01:33:25,840
... for her!

1180
01:33:28,960 --> 01:33:30,680
Here...

1181
01:33:31,480 --> 01:33:33,160
You have to prove it happened, mate.

1182
01:33:33,240 --> 01:33:35,360
Go! Go!

1183
01:35:57,560 --> 01:35:58,400
Sam.

1184
01:35:58,800 --> 01:36:00,160
Fuck!

1185
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:16,960
Ryan.

1186
01:36:17,240 --> 01:36:18,960
You tried licking your own balls yet?.

1187
01:36:22,920 --> 01:36:25,720
I forgot -- you don't fucking have any.

1188
01:37:19,240 --> 01:37:20,760
Think it's all over?.

1189
01:37:20,760 --> 01:37:22,000
It is now.
