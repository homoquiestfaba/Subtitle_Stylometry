1
00:00:48,581 --> 00:00:56,249
After Father went to Carthage,
Mother never smiled with her eyes.

2
00:01:01,027 --> 00:01:07,591
Somehow I think she already knew
he wasn't coming back.

3
00:01:07,934 --> 00:01:10,494
He was killed a few days later.

4
00:01:45,572 --> 00:01:47,506
Mother was a widow
with five young children

5
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:51,633
when Louis Bidamon
first came to call.

6
00:01:52,245 --> 00:01:55,578
He could never take Father's place
in her heart.

7
00:01:55,915 --> 00:01:57,576
But he was good to us all.

8
00:01:57,917 --> 00:02:03,287
And for 20 years, he and Mother
shared a marriage of affection.

9
00:02:17,704 --> 00:02:25,975
Then, when Mother was 60 years old,
she discovered a painful secret.

10
00:02:26,346 --> 00:02:30,680
Louis had betrayed her
with a woman half her age.

11
00:02:31,451 --> 00:02:33,078
They had a son.

12
00:02:33,219 --> 00:02:37,417
And when the woman
could no longer care for the boy,

13
00:02:37,557 --> 00:02:39,525
she brought him to Mother.

14
00:02:43,229 --> 00:02:47,029
Mama calls me: Charlie.

15
00:02:49,369 --> 00:02:53,169
Mama told me all about you.

16
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:57,533
I see.

17
00:03:16,763 --> 00:03:18,458
Mother took Charlie in,

18
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:24,059
and for the rest of her life,
she raised him as one of her own.

19
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:28,163
But she did something
even more amazing.

20
00:03:28,308 --> 00:03:31,641
She hired Charlie's mother
to work at the house,

21
00:03:31,778 --> 00:03:35,680
so that she could 
be near her son.

22
00:03:36,783 --> 00:03:40,742
That's the kind of woman
my mother was.

23
00:04:09,048 --> 00:04:12,211
Mother was always taking in strays.

24
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:14,445
I was one of them.

25
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:18,589
Mine had been a very hard Iife.

26
00:04:20,059 --> 00:04:24,655
When Mother's health began to fail, 
I came home to care for her.

27
00:04:24,797 --> 00:04:31,202
But the truth is, even then
she was taking care of me.

28
00:04:31,337 --> 00:04:33,805
The lilacs
are early this year, Mother.

29
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:38,374
The bush you planted near Father's
grave is already covered with them.

30
00:04:38,645 --> 00:04:40,806
I planted it there to remind me.

31
00:04:41,581 --> 00:04:42,707
Of what?

32
00:04:42,849 --> 00:04:46,444
Life is a very good teacher.

33
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:50,246
Lilacs don't last very long, Julia.

34
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:52,187
Best things in life seldom do.

35
00:04:53,359 --> 00:04:56,226
That makes them all the sweeter.

36
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:57,823
What's this?

37
00:04:59,766 --> 00:05:02,701
My first book of hymns.

38
00:05:02,869 --> 00:05:06,498
You know you've lived too long when
you can't see the words anymore.

39
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,834
Or remember the tune.

40
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:12,740
I'm surprised anyone could read
those words.

41
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:15,541
Paper was scarce at the time.

42
00:05:15,682 --> 00:05:17,741
I always wished that I could sing.

43
00:05:17,884 --> 00:05:19,078
You can.

44
00:05:19,218 --> 00:05:20,685
Be honest, Mother.

45
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,845
I can't even carry a tune.

46
00:05:23,189 --> 00:05:25,783
There are songs in everyone, Julia.

47
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:28,252
And God can hear all of them.

48
00:05:29,896 --> 00:05:32,660
I wish that I had your strength.

49
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:35,233
Strength isn't something you have.

50
00:05:35,368 --> 00:05:37,768
It's. . . .

51
00:05:37,904 --> 00:05:41,169
It's something you find.

52
00:05:43,543 --> 00:05:46,876
I Learned that Lesson early in life.

53
00:05:47,213 --> 00:05:50,182
I will not have Emma
deceiving herself.

54
00:05:50,316 --> 00:05:52,716
Isaac,  Please!

55
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:54,717
She's just a child.

56
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:56,754
As much as some want
to believe otherwise,

57
00:05:56,889 --> 00:06:00,552
the fact is, God does not interfere
in our lives.

58
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:03,685
We must learn to rely on ourselves.

59
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:11,896
Emma, remember,
no praying in this house.

60
00:06:14,774 --> 00:06:18,801
When Father took a stand,
he was not easily swayed.

61
00:06:18,945 --> 00:06:22,472
And his example taught me
to be the same way.

62
00:06:23,516 --> 00:06:25,347
What did you do?

63
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:28,645
I found strength
to take a stand of my own.

64
00:06:28,788 --> 00:06:32,656
If I could not pray in the house,
then I would pray somewhere else.

65
00:06:32,792 --> 00:06:36,592
Papa says we can't pray anymore.

66
00:06:39,966 --> 00:06:42,833
One day he'd found me
praying for him.

67
00:06:42,969 --> 00:06:46,928
I was asking God
to help my father find faith.

68
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:55,413
Please help my papa. . . .

69
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:14,833
If it means that much to you, Emmy,
we'll pray from now on.

70
00:07:14,967 --> 00:07:18,334
Prayer changes things, Julia.

71
00:07:18,504 --> 00:07:21,530
Not for me.
It can.

72
00:07:21,674 --> 00:07:23,266
Troubles is, most of us

73
00:07:23,409 --> 00:07:26,901
have to keep learning
the same lesson over and over,

74
00:07:27,246 --> 00:07:30,704
before it finally sticks.

75
00:07:33,986 --> 00:07:37,888
Your father helped me to learn
many such lessons.

76
00:07:39,358 --> 00:07:41,849
The same tomorrow, boys!

77
00:07:42,028 --> 00:07:43,893
He told me
how the two of you met.

78
00:07:44,363 --> 00:07:45,830
Oh?

79
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:48,695
He said it was love at first sight.

80
00:08:02,048 --> 00:08:07,008
But Father did not approve.

81
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:14,252
I don't think your father
likes me much.

82
00:08:14,393 --> 00:08:15,917
He worries, that's all.

83
00:08:16,062 --> 00:08:16,926
About what?

84
00:08:17,063 --> 00:08:21,022
Just. . . .
From stories he's heard.

85
00:08:22,802 --> 00:08:27,637
What if I told you
that some of them are true?

86
00:08:27,773 --> 00:08:32,267
Of visions and angels.

87
00:08:34,447 --> 00:08:43,845
I believe the faith of a child
can do miraculous things.

88
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:49,860
If I had not experienced what I have,
I might not believe it myself.

89
00:08:51,097 --> 00:08:53,531
But you do believe it?

90
00:08:55,101 --> 00:08:58,434
I see it in your eyes.

91
00:09:02,074 --> 00:09:03,803
What else do you see?

92
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:10,046
It's getting very warm in here.

93
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:14,649
Hold it just like this,
so it's fiat against the water.

94
00:09:14,954 --> 00:09:17,479
Let me give it a try.

95
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:21,317
Right.

96
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:31,036
Are you sure you want to do that?

97
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:33,099
Yes.

98
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,835
Checkmate.

99
00:09:35,975 --> 00:09:39,411
What did you call me?

100
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:41,974
I thought a great deal
about what you told me.

101
00:09:42,114 --> 00:09:43,741
And?

102
00:09:43,883 --> 00:09:46,579
I believe you.

103
00:09:53,693 --> 00:09:55,024
Start counting.

104
00:09:55,161 --> 00:09:57,755
One, two, three.

105
00:09:57,897 --> 00:10:00,923
Do not count out loud.

106
00:10:02,735 --> 00:10:04,532
I will not have you
throw away your future

107
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:08,697
on this. . .this dreamer.

108
00:10:08,841 --> 00:10:13,801
God heard and answered
the prayer of a boy, Emma.

109
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:15,914
He will answer you.

110
00:10:16,048 --> 00:10:19,484
I was hopelessly caught
between Father's stubborn doubt

111
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:22,144
and the witness of truth,

112
00:10:22,488 --> 00:10:25,889
which was growing in my heart.

113
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:36,965
All right, on the count of three.
Ready?

114
00:10:37,103 --> 00:10:40,163
One, two. . . .

115
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:46,075
Where did you learn
to ride like that?

116
00:10:46,212 --> 00:10:48,510
I was riding before I could walk.

117
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:02,685
What if I count
with my mouth closed?

118
00:11:15,241 --> 00:11:17,835
<i>A penny for a spool of thread</i>

119
00:11:17,977 --> 00:11:20,207
<i>A penny for a needle</i>

120
00:11:20,546 --> 00:11:22,912
<i>That's the way the money goes</i>

121
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:25,517
<i>Pop goes the weasel
( Laughs )</i>

122
00:11:26,252 --> 00:11:28,049
God gave us voices.
We need to sing.

123
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:31,645
Oh, Miss Hale, you are
a mighty stern taskmaster.

124
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:35,158
That's what friends do
for each other.

125
00:11:35,494 --> 00:11:39,624
My oldest brother Alvin
was the best friend I ever had. . .

126
00:11:40,232 --> 00:11:43,463
. . .until now.

127
00:11:43,602 --> 00:11:45,832
I asked your father's permission.

128
00:11:46,272 --> 00:11:48,172
He wouldn't even hear me out.

129
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:53,872
Father is just being fatherly. . .

130
00:11:55,014 --> 00:11:57,244
. . .and stubborn.

131
00:11:57,950 --> 00:11:59,850
-Be patient.
-I'm trying.

132
00:12:01,287 --> 00:12:07,886
Emma, it's not your father
that I'm in Love with.

133
00:12:11,797 --> 00:12:15,164
Father never would give us
his blessing.

134
00:12:15,301 --> 00:12:18,896
Finally, we married without it.

135
00:12:20,005 --> 00:12:23,566
When you're in love,
you come to rely on each other.

136
00:12:27,713 --> 00:12:29,704
We've hauled more rock
and built more fence

137
00:12:29,849 --> 00:12:31,976
than any of us care to remember.

138
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:33,183
That is true.

139
00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:34,616
And every one of them,

140
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:37,814
''Horse high and hog tight,''
as Father used to say.

141
00:12:37,957 --> 00:12:39,686
You boys used to listen to me then.

142
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:45,663
Hyrum here has been
looking after me

143
00:12:45,798 --> 00:12:47,789
as long as I can remember.

144
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:51,232
And believe me, with this rascaI
you married, it hasn't been easy.

145
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:53,936
Don't listen to a word.

146
00:12:54,073 --> 00:12:57,099
Well, boys, let's go finish
some chores.

147
00:12:58,244 --> 00:12:59,233
It was delicious.

148
00:12:59,578 --> 00:13:01,307
Thank you, Mother.

149
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:12,114
Emma, I always used to tell the boys
that if they are wise,

150
00:13:12,258 --> 00:13:15,989
they will marry
above themselves, as I did.

151
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:20,963
Looks to me
like Joseph's done just fine.

152
00:13:23,035 --> 00:13:24,593
Thank you.

153
00:13:24,737 --> 00:13:25,965
For what?

154
00:13:26,105 --> 00:13:29,131
For making Joseph so happy.

155
00:13:30,709 --> 00:13:34,805
It's a wonderful thing when someone
you Love believes in you.

156
00:13:40,119 --> 00:13:43,247
Your father will come around, I think.

157
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:45,721
I pray for that.

158
00:13:45,858 --> 00:13:51,057
My husband has never agreed
with organized religion.

159
00:13:51,197 --> 00:13:54,894
He cannot accept
all of their doctrines.

160
00:13:55,401 --> 00:13:59,201
Our whole married Iife
I have been praying

161
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:03,604
that one day we would be united
in our faith.

162
00:14:07,413 --> 00:14:11,042
Those prayers will be answered.

163
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:13,117
They will for you, too.

164
00:14:13,252 --> 00:14:16,949
God hears every prayer of our heart.

165
00:14:17,089 --> 00:14:19,751
Even those which go unspoken?

166
00:14:22,728 --> 00:14:24,389
You don't believe that, do you?

167
00:14:27,433 --> 00:14:30,300
Look at me, Mother.

168
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:34,702
I've already buried one husband,
divorced another. . . .

169
00:14:35,441 --> 00:14:39,707
I'm sick most of the time,
and I can't find out why.

170
00:14:41,447 --> 00:14:44,939
I have nothing to sing about.

171
00:14:47,152 --> 00:14:50,087
I don't even know
what to believe anymore.

172
00:14:51,924 --> 00:14:55,826
Have you ever tried cuddling a child
that doesn't want to be held?

173
00:14:55,961 --> 00:14:58,327
You were like that.

174
00:14:58,464 --> 00:15:01,058
Sometimes you still are.

175
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,929
I know.

176
00:15:03,469 --> 00:15:08,338
God loves us, JuIia,
even when we hold back.

177
00:15:12,711 --> 00:15:14,372
When Alvin died,

178
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:19,781
the Reverend told us
he was lost forever.

179
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:22,717
Just because
he had never been baptized.

180
00:15:23,722 --> 00:15:28,750
I don't believe God
would be so cruel.

181
00:15:31,897 --> 00:15:37,358
I saw God the Father
and His son, Jesus Christ.

182
00:15:37,503 --> 00:15:44,204
It happened here, Emma,
in this very spot.

183
00:15:45,311 --> 00:15:47,370
Father was just 14.

184
00:15:47,513 --> 00:15:49,947
Perhaps, he only imagined it.

185
00:15:50,082 --> 00:15:54,041
No, JuIia.
God answered Joseph's prayer.

186
00:15:54,186 --> 00:15:56,416
And He answered mine.

187
00:15:56,755 --> 00:16:00,191
Oh, I didn't see a light
or hear a voice,

188
00:16:00,326 --> 00:16:02,817
but my answer was no less real.

189
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:06,090
He said that He had a work
for me to do.

190
00:16:06,231 --> 00:16:07,129
He did?

191
00:16:07,266 --> 00:16:08,858
The messenger told him of a book

192
00:16:09,001 --> 00:16:12,129
that was written
by ancient prophets.

193
00:16:12,271 --> 00:16:17,299
He said it contains a fullness
of the gospel of Jesus Christ,

194
00:16:17,443 --> 00:16:20,776
and he was to help bring it forth.

195
00:16:22,548 --> 00:16:25,415
You were there
when Father received the plates?

196
00:16:25,551 --> 00:16:28,384
I waited for him
at the bottom of the hill.

197
00:16:29,555 --> 00:16:32,991
From the moment the record
came into his hands. . .

198
00:16:34,226 --> 00:16:38,856
. . .it seemed that all the powers
of Earth and hell

199
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:42,525
were determined to take it from him.

200
00:16:45,571 --> 00:16:47,505
He is not a prophet.

201
00:16:49,274 --> 00:16:51,208
Stop!

202
00:16:52,378 --> 00:16:55,313
Don't do this, Emma.

203
00:16:55,481 --> 00:16:57,278
-I'd Like to kill him myself.
-Yeah.

204
00:16:58,817 --> 00:17:00,546
Now all we need is a plan.

205
00:17:04,923 --> 00:17:07,483
Not yet.

206
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:13,192
It was a frightening glimpse
of the future.

207
00:17:13,999 --> 00:17:16,092
It's got to be in here.

208
00:17:17,436 --> 00:17:18,368
Look under the floor!

209
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:20,562
Where is it?

210
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:25,236
What happened?

211
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:29,370
News of our trouble
seemed to soften Father's heart.

212
00:17:29,515 --> 00:17:31,483
He invited us to come home.

213
00:17:35,354 --> 00:17:39,484
We took every precaution
to keep the record safe.

214
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:43,254
Joseph has been commanded
to translate the record.

215
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:46,489
You married a dreamer, Emma.

216
00:17:46,632 --> 00:17:48,532
Translate.

217
00:17:48,867 --> 00:17:51,563
He can hardly read and write.

218
00:17:54,206 --> 00:17:57,869
Until he gives up
these foolish ideas,

219
00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:03,243
he is no longer welcome
in this house.

220
00:18:06,952 --> 00:18:13,118
He'll change his mind
after the baby comes.

221
00:18:18,464 --> 00:18:20,295
Father was right about one thing.

222
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:24,266
At that time, Joseph could not
dictate a well -worded letter,

223
00:18:24,403 --> 00:18:26,530
let alone a book.

224
00:18:26,672 --> 00:18:29,971
Martin Harris became his scribe.

225
00:18:30,976 --> 00:18:33,604
How was the record translated?

226
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:36,642
Just as Joseph said:

227
00:18:37,082 --> 00:18:40,142
''By the gift of God.''

228
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:43,379
The work went rapidly forward.

229
00:18:43,589 --> 00:18:45,557
Then Martin asked for a favor.

230
00:18:45,691 --> 00:18:48,285
He wanted to show
the manuscript to his wife,

231
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,894
which seemed a harmless request,

232
00:18:51,029 --> 00:18:55,227
especially from one
who had helped us so much.

233
00:18:57,336 --> 00:19:01,898
I've asked the Lord again,

234
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:04,941
''What should I do?''

235
00:19:05,077 --> 00:19:10,538
<i>Believe me if all
your endearing young charms</i>

236
00:19:10,682 --> 00:19:15,984
<i>That l gaze on so fondly today</i>

237
00:19:16,622 --> 00:19:20,251
And there's more to it,
but I don't know the words.

238
00:19:21,527 --> 00:19:29,298
I think if it's a girI,
I'll call her ''Emm'' for short.

239
00:19:29,434 --> 00:19:33,131
If it's a boy, let's name him Alvin.

240
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:35,439
I wish I'd met him.

241
00:19:35,574 --> 00:19:36,939
So do I.

242
00:19:37,743 --> 00:19:40,576
Right here.

243
00:20:39,037 --> 00:20:41,096
That was the first
of so many names

244
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:44,300
I would write in
that family Bible.

245
00:20:44,443 --> 00:20:54,318
Alvin, Thadeus, Louisa,
little Joseph,

246
00:20:54,453 --> 00:20:59,220
and my precious Don Carlos.

247
00:21:05,297 --> 00:21:09,495
In the midst of our loss,
another worry toward our hearts.

248
00:21:09,635 --> 00:21:12,103
I don't understand, Joseph.

249
00:21:12,404 --> 00:21:14,565
How does Martin lose 116 pages?

250
00:21:14,706 --> 00:21:16,071
We looked everywhere.

251
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:18,073
He promised he would keep it safe.

252
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:21,145
I should have listened to the Lord.

253
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:24,581
He only wanted to convince his wife.

254
00:21:24,716 --> 00:21:27,048
The Lord said no.

255
00:21:27,185 --> 00:21:29,517
And I kept asking.

256
00:21:29,655 --> 00:21:32,089
I feared man more than God.

257
00:21:32,224 --> 00:21:34,715
-Well, then, it's Martin's fault.
-Whatever the excuse is. . .

258
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:37,727
. . .the manuscript is lost.

259
00:21:37,863 --> 00:21:41,060
And I am accountable for it.

260
00:21:41,199 --> 00:21:44,760
Emma, I may have lost my soul.

261
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:53,743
I never prayed harder
than I did during that time.

262
00:21:53,879 --> 00:21:57,178
And Joseph prayed as well.

263
00:21:57,316 --> 00:22:00,843
But the Lord didn't answer
right away.

264
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:27,708
Joseph, take some water.

265
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:29,507
No.

266
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:32,579
This garden is not doing well, Emma.

267
00:22:34,419 --> 00:22:35,750
How are you?

268
00:22:37,255 --> 00:22:38,882
I Let the Lord down.

269
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,328
You've done all you can do.

270
00:22:43,462 --> 00:22:45,692
And what if that's not enough?

271
00:22:46,932 --> 00:22:49,196
I was reading in the Bible that. . .

272
00:22:49,835 --> 00:22:54,898
. . .no amount of sorrow
can make things right.

273
00:22:55,774 --> 00:22:58,334
Only the Lord's Love can do that.

274
00:23:01,913 --> 00:23:05,212
If we let Him.

275
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:12,414
After that,
Joseph lived by one rule:

276
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:16,891
<b>When the Lord commands, do it.</b>

277
00:23:19,965 --> 00:23:22,832
Life is a very good teacher.

278
00:23:22,968 --> 00:23:25,903
It's been a very hard one for me.

279
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:29,435
That doesn't mean
God loves you less.

280
00:23:29,808 --> 00:23:32,333
Your father used to say,

281
00:23:32,477 --> 00:23:38,313
''Sometimes God brings us low
before He can lift us higher.''

282
00:23:38,984 --> 00:23:41,714
I've experienced that all my life.

283
00:23:42,387 --> 00:23:43,752
Down from the generation. . . .

284
00:23:43,889 --> 00:23:47,256
In time, Joseph was entrusted
with the record once more.

285
00:23:47,392 --> 00:23:49,656
Until the time comes. . . .

286
00:23:49,795 --> 00:23:52,320
I wrote
while he translated for a while.

287
00:23:52,464 --> 00:23:55,956
We shall be restored.

288
00:23:56,401 --> 00:24:01,600
I caused that they should hide
themselves without the walls.

289
00:24:03,975 --> 00:24:05,966
-Emma.
-Yes?

290
00:24:06,311 --> 00:24:08,370
Was there a wall around Jerusalem?

291
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:10,608
Yes.

292
00:24:11,917 --> 00:24:12,941
I didn't know.

293
00:24:14,886 --> 00:24:18,652
I'm not sure how to pronounce
the next one. I'll just spell it.

294
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:22,692
<b>L-E-M-U-E-L.</b>

295
00:24:22,828 --> 00:24:27,561
It was marvelous to me
as much as anyone else.

296
00:24:27,699 --> 00:24:30,998
I knew the book
was of divine authenticity.

297
00:24:32,037 --> 00:24:34,005
I had not the slightest doubt of it.

298
00:24:37,709 --> 00:24:41,975
In time, the Lord sent another
to assist with the work.

299
00:24:43,882 --> 00:24:46,316
When the translation
was nearly completed,

300
00:24:46,451 --> 00:24:48,612
Joseph said
that a few would be privileged

301
00:24:48,753 --> 00:24:51,551
to see the plates for themselves.

302
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:54,591
I fancied I might be among them.

303
00:24:56,561 --> 00:25:01,396
Emma, it's the Lord that chose,
not me.

304
00:25:01,533 --> 00:25:05,765
Mary Whitmer told me herself
that she saw the plates.

305
00:25:05,904 --> 00:25:08,031
Do you know how many times
I could have looked?

306
00:25:08,373 --> 00:25:11,399
But I did as you said.

307
00:25:11,543 --> 00:25:14,478
Why her and not me?

308
00:25:14,613 --> 00:25:16,706
Emma. . . .

309
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:20,944
All of my life I wanted to make Father
proud of me, Joseph.

310
00:25:21,086 --> 00:25:24,920
He is not proud of me now.
He thinks I'm a fool.

311
00:25:25,824 --> 00:25:29,555
Have I failed in God's eyes as well?

312
00:25:29,694 --> 00:25:34,393
Sometimes the Lord tries our faith,

313
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:38,299
but He'll never give us
more than we're able to handle.

314
00:25:39,604 --> 00:25:43,665
Maybe He just trusts you too much.

315
00:25:45,744 --> 00:25:49,703
Emma, he's making a fool out of you.

316
00:25:49,848 --> 00:25:56,981
I can't believe that a daughter
of mine couId be so taken in.

317
00:25:57,122 --> 00:26:00,683
You haven't seen this record?

318
00:26:00,825 --> 00:26:05,728
Then how can you be certain
he even has this gold Bible?

319
00:26:05,864 --> 00:26:07,923
Emma!

320
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:11,524
I taught you better than this!

321
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:41,593
Father, sometimes
you know things with your heart

322
00:26:41,733 --> 00:26:45,669
that you don't know with your head.

323
00:26:45,804 --> 00:26:47,738
Didn't you ever see the plates?

324
00:26:47,872 --> 00:26:50,033
I didn't have to.

325
00:26:50,175 --> 00:26:54,043
Strength doesn't come
through seeing, Julia.

326
00:26:54,179 --> 00:26:56,113
It only comes through faith.

327
00:26:57,182 --> 00:27:01,141
Really, Mother,
I think I would have looked.

328
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:10,727
Emma.
Emma, it's finished.

329
00:27:20,705 --> 00:27:23,606
Look, ''An Account Written
by the Hand of Mormon,

330
00:27:23,742 --> 00:27:26,711
upon the Plates
Taken from the Plates of Nephi.''

331
00:27:26,845 --> 00:27:29,075
''By Joseph Smith, Junior.''

332
00:27:29,214 --> 00:27:33,082
Here, let me show you something.

333
00:27:35,854 --> 00:27:41,520
''If ye shall ask in faith,
with a sincere heart,

334
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:48,498
He shall manifest the Truth unto you
by the power of the Holy Ghost.''

335
00:27:49,701 --> 00:27:57,198
''And by the power of the Holy Ghost,
ye may know the truth of all things.''

336
00:28:04,249 --> 00:28:08,982
I propose that we proceed
and organize ourselves as a church,

337
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:12,055
according
to the commandments of God.

338
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:16,991
All those who are in agreement,
please so indicate.

339
00:28:19,597 --> 00:28:21,155
Thank you.

340
00:28:44,122 --> 00:28:47,717
If it means that much
to you, Emmy. . . .

341
00:28:50,295 --> 00:28:54,595
Now work with a elect lady,
whom I have chosen.

342
00:28:58,303 --> 00:29:06,904
Joseph, what did the Lord mean
in the revelation by ''an elect lady''?

343
00:29:07,278 --> 00:29:09,269
He meant you.

344
00:29:09,614 --> 00:29:14,278
You, Emma, are a woman
of great worth.

345
00:29:14,686 --> 00:29:16,119
At times, I wonder.

346
00:29:20,258 --> 00:29:22,283
Selecting the hymns
is just the beginning.

347
00:29:24,696 --> 00:29:28,928
You're to expound the scriptures,
exhort the saints.

348
00:29:29,067 --> 00:29:33,026
The truth is, Emma,

349
00:29:33,171 --> 00:29:38,302
I really on your counsel
even more than you know.

350
00:29:48,887 --> 00:29:51,117
It's just as well.

351
00:29:51,823 --> 00:29:54,621
I am. . . .

352
00:29:54,759 --> 00:29:58,024
We are. . . .

353
00:29:58,363 --> 00:30:00,854
-Really?
-Yes.

354
00:30:01,099 --> 00:30:04,933
-Are you certain?
-Yes, I'm certain.

355
00:30:05,603 --> 00:30:08,003
What can I do?

356
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:12,940
Well, should an elect lady
have to do the dishes alone?

357
00:30:17,782 --> 00:30:20,808
Do not count out loud.

358
00:30:21,386 --> 00:30:25,117
One, two, three.
One, two, three.

359
00:30:26,224 --> 00:30:31,753
The cradle you made,
is it big enough for two?

360
00:30:31,896 --> 00:30:35,354
Two?
Maybe.

361
00:30:38,903 --> 00:30:41,167
I think you better sit down.

362
00:30:41,306 --> 00:30:42,967
I think I better sit down

363
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:54,250
<i>To my heart to sing Thy praise</i>

364
00:30:54,385 --> 00:30:57,821
Murmur not because of
the things which thou has not seen.

365
00:30:57,956 --> 00:31:02,359
Lay aside the things of this world
and seek for those of a better.

366
00:31:03,962 --> 00:31:07,193
That revelation
was the source of great strength.

367
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:11,767
A song of the heart is a prayer,

368
00:31:11,903 --> 00:31:13,336
and God must have known

369
00:31:13,671 --> 00:31:16,105
how much
I would need those prayers.

370
00:31:16,241 --> 00:31:18,232
Ohio is so far away.

371
00:31:18,743 --> 00:31:19,801
I know.

372
00:31:19,944 --> 00:31:22,936
Will I ever see you again?

373
00:31:23,081 --> 00:31:24,309
Come and visit.

374
00:31:24,449 --> 00:31:28,943
Or you can always come home
and visit.

375
00:31:31,356 --> 00:31:33,722
Father says if I go,
I'm not welcome.

376
00:31:34,259 --> 00:31:36,227
You know he doesn't really
mean that.

377
00:31:44,469 --> 00:31:46,664
This was my grandmother's.

378
00:31:46,804 --> 00:31:49,238
She gave it to my mother.

379
00:31:49,374 --> 00:31:53,367
Now I want you to take it,
as a reminder.

380
00:31:53,711 --> 00:31:56,771
You can always come home.

381
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:07,856
Mother.

382
00:32:11,496 --> 00:32:13,726
This means so much to me.

383
00:32:20,004 --> 00:32:25,169
Don't you want to find out
for yourself?

384
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:26,971
I wish I could.

385
00:32:29,981 --> 00:32:31,414
I'm sorry.

386
00:32:39,891 --> 00:32:42,917
I never saw Mother 
or Father again.

387
00:33:16,561 --> 00:33:19,962
This one's gonna be just fine.

388
00:33:20,098 --> 00:33:22,225
Keep pushing, keep pushing.

389
00:33:22,367 --> 00:33:24,232
This baby's gonna come.

390
00:33:36,547 --> 00:33:39,778
They came too early.

391
00:33:39,984 --> 00:33:42,544
That's not your fault.

392
00:33:45,823 --> 00:33:49,520
What if I can never have a child?

393
00:34:00,271 --> 00:34:05,038
You are the choice of my heart.

394
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:11,212
Emma, it will work out.

395
00:34:23,261 --> 00:34:27,061
Even tragedies
can become blessings.

396
00:34:27,198 --> 00:34:28,495
When your mother
died giving birth,

397
00:34:28,633 --> 00:34:31,363
they brought you
and your brother to me.

398
00:34:32,203 --> 00:34:37,402
Raising you as my daughter has been
one of the great joys of my life.

399
00:34:38,309 --> 00:34:40,971
Oh, Mother.

400
00:34:44,515 --> 00:34:46,506
Oh, Mrs. Hopkins.

401
00:34:46,651 --> 00:34:49,211
This is the truth
about that so-called golden Bible.

402
00:34:49,353 --> 00:34:53,847
<i>Mormonism Unveiled.
You'll want to read it.</i>

403
00:34:56,194 --> 00:34:58,059
You're Mrs. Smith.

404
00:34:58,196 --> 00:34:59,527
Have we met?

405
00:34:59,664 --> 00:35:02,258
Oh, I know who you are.

406
00:35:05,069 --> 00:35:06,400
I see.

407
00:35:06,537 --> 00:35:09,062
All this talk of visions
and revelations,

408
00:35:09,207 --> 00:35:12,142
no good will ever come of it.

409
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:15,268
Good things have already come of it.

410
00:35:15,413 --> 00:35:20,476
My dear, if you believe that,
you're as confused as your husband.

411
00:35:35,666 --> 00:35:37,133
Joseph!

412
00:35:43,541 --> 00:35:45,941
Hey, you thirsty?

413
00:35:48,346 --> 00:35:51,213
Come on,
this is how the Holy Ghost. . . .

414
00:35:55,419 --> 00:35:57,250
I have the tar coming, boys.

415
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:37,288
There will always be opposition.

416
00:36:43,768 --> 00:36:46,669
How much do we have to endure?

417
00:37:01,018 --> 00:37:03,578
We talk of Christ.

418
00:37:04,088 --> 00:37:07,182
We rejoice in Christ.

419
00:37:07,325 --> 00:37:11,625
He will bare our grief.
He will carry our sorrows.

420
00:37:12,163 --> 00:37:15,257
Carry our sorrows?

421
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:19,165
The very next day my brother died.

422
00:37:19,303 --> 00:37:20,600
Poor little Joseph.

423
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:26,040
He died in my arms.
There was nothing I could do.

424
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:30,578
If God is so kind, why does He
allow the innocent to suffer?

425
00:37:30,715 --> 00:37:33,650
I've asked that question 1 ,000 times.

426
00:37:33,784 --> 00:37:36,719
And the answer is always the same.

427
00:37:37,054 --> 00:37:41,388
God's ways are not
always our ways.

428
00:37:41,525 --> 00:37:45,017
I just can't accept that, Mother.

429
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:51,491
When we embark on a journey,

430
00:37:51,636 --> 00:37:54,230
we must keep our eyes forward.

431
00:37:54,372 --> 00:37:56,306
Never look back.

432
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:03,041
Morning, Brigham.
Parley.

433
00:38:15,192 --> 00:38:17,592
Sorry, ma'am.

434
00:38:19,096 --> 00:38:21,496
Good morning, Father.

435
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:27,760
If you're looking for your husband,
he's out there.

436
00:38:29,473 --> 00:38:34,672
What kind of prophet would run
through the streets like a schoolboy?

437
00:38:34,812 --> 00:38:37,645
If God wanted to speak
to men in our day,

438
00:38:37,782 --> 00:38:41,718
it would not be to a 14 year old boy.

439
00:38:42,586 --> 00:38:48,718
Unless, of course,
only a boy would listen.

440
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:57,259
Good day.

441
00:39:01,138 --> 00:39:02,799
The one thing I knew for certain

442
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:06,803
was that Joseph
had been called of God.

443
00:39:07,878 --> 00:39:11,780
We do not ask people to give up
any good that they have.

444
00:39:11,916 --> 00:39:16,751
We only invite them to come
and to get more.

445
00:39:27,431 --> 00:39:28,796
Hyrum.

446
00:39:28,933 --> 00:39:30,696
How much longer is the meeting?

447
00:39:30,868 --> 00:39:35,305
I thought it would be over by now.

448
00:39:38,175 --> 00:39:39,870
Emma.

449
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:43,646
Joseph is talking
of building a temple.

450
00:39:44,348 --> 00:39:45,212
A what?

451
00:39:45,349 --> 00:39:47,214
A temple.

452
00:39:50,955 --> 00:39:52,616
Can we do that?

453
00:39:52,757 --> 00:39:54,554
I don't know.

454
00:39:55,192 --> 00:39:58,320
Part of me says we can't afford it,
we don't know how to do it,

455
00:39:58,462 --> 00:40:02,865
and a hundred other reasons
why the answer should be no.

456
00:40:03,901 --> 00:40:05,334
My whole life I've been--

457
00:40:05,469 --> 00:40:08,700
-He has vision.
-Yes.

458
00:40:10,708 --> 00:40:14,872
When I look at Joseph,
I stop thinking about ''how,''

459
00:40:15,212 --> 00:40:17,237
and I start thinking ''when.''

460
00:40:17,381 --> 00:40:19,440
So do I.

461
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:28,920
Father was often away, wasn't he?

462
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:33,321
More and more
as the work expanded.

463
00:40:33,564 --> 00:40:36,192
Perhaps I relied on Joseph
too much.

464
00:40:37,902 --> 00:40:40,837
And that was
the hardest test for me.

465
00:40:40,971 --> 00:40:45,601
Being alone and facing the birth
of another child.

466
00:41:01,892 --> 00:41:04,986
Here is your son.

467
00:41:05,796 --> 00:41:08,424
What a happy day.

468
00:41:12,036 --> 00:41:15,267
He's so beautiful.

469
00:41:15,406 --> 00:41:18,341
Hi, Joseph.

470
00:41:18,709 --> 00:41:20,301
Yes.

471
00:41:20,444 --> 00:41:22,605
That's you, Joseph.

472
00:41:29,887 --> 00:41:32,947
God's tender mercies
are all around us, Julia.

473
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:35,588
Beautiful boy.

474
00:41:35,726 --> 00:41:38,593
We just have to be willing to see.

475
00:41:38,829 --> 00:41:41,798
Disappointments come to us all.

476
00:41:41,932 --> 00:41:45,333
I must be content
to teach other people's children.

477
00:41:45,603 --> 00:41:47,901
There's always reason to hope.

478
00:41:48,038 --> 00:41:52,270
I find it difficult to believe
in things I cannot see.

479
00:41:52,476 --> 00:41:57,573
Some things
are more certain than sight.

480
00:41:57,715 --> 00:41:59,740
Lydia.

481
00:41:59,884 --> 00:42:05,652
Read the revelations for yourself,
then ask of God.

482
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:15,331
''I, the Lord,
knowing the calamity''. . . .

483
00:42:15,466 --> 00:42:19,368
It's been my experience
that revelation doesn't come

484
00:42:19,503 --> 00:42:22,666
until you are ready to ask.

485
00:42:33,083 --> 00:42:34,641
When you're a little older, son,

486
00:42:34,785 --> 00:42:39,688
I will tell you all about how proud
I am of your mother.

487
00:42:39,823 --> 00:42:44,817
She always seems to be
lifting my sights.

488
00:42:44,962 --> 00:42:46,327
For example,

489
00:42:47,131 --> 00:42:51,568
the Lord's law of health,
the word of wisdom,

490
00:42:51,702 --> 00:42:55,900
wasn't revealed until after
your mother raised the question.

491
00:43:00,811 --> 00:43:08,081
Thou has grieved for the hardness
of the hearts of thy father's house.

492
00:43:09,787 --> 00:43:14,121
And thou has longed
for their salvation.

493
00:43:15,659 --> 00:43:19,652
The Lord will have respect
for thy cries

494
00:43:19,797 --> 00:43:22,561
and cause some of them to repent.

495
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:26,101
Seems you were right
about that gold Bible.

496
00:43:27,404 --> 00:43:29,463
No.

497
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:33,141
No, I was dreadfully wrong.

498
00:43:34,411 --> 00:43:38,609
Joseph said we were not
just building a temple.

499
00:43:39,149 --> 00:43:42,380
The Lord was building us.

500
00:43:47,157 --> 00:43:50,456
I think it will be perfect
for the temple dedication.

501
00:43:50,594 --> 00:43:51,925
Brother Phelps
just finished it in time.

502
00:43:52,062 --> 00:43:54,724
It's the last hymn of my book.

503
00:43:54,865 --> 00:43:56,730
Would you sing that song again?

504
00:44:00,838 --> 00:44:06,777
<i>The spirit of God like a fire
is burning</i>

505
00:44:06,910 --> 00:44:11,973
<i>The Latter-day glory
begins to come forth</i>

506
00:44:12,116 --> 00:44:16,746
One night,
when I was praying in a temple,

507
00:44:16,887 --> 00:44:19,447
I saw a glimpse into Heaven.

508
00:44:19,590 --> 00:44:22,423
And my brother Alvin was there.

509
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:25,758
And I wondered how that could be.

510
00:44:25,896 --> 00:44:32,062
Because, you see, Alvin died before
he ever got a chance to be baptized.

511
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:34,528
And the voice of the Lord told me

512
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:37,835
that all those
without a knowledge of the Gospel

513
00:44:37,975 --> 00:44:39,772
will have a chance to hear it. . .

514
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:41,842
. . .and accept it.

515
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:49,449
Mother, don't you want to find out
for yourself?

516
00:44:52,089 --> 00:44:54,956
I would if I could.

517
00:44:57,161 --> 00:45:00,062
That means that Heavenly Father
has a plan

518
00:45:00,197 --> 00:45:03,826
so that all of His children
can come back and live with Him,

519
00:45:03,967 --> 00:45:05,229
if we listen.

520
00:45:07,938 --> 00:45:10,168
Do you really believe that, Mother?

521
00:45:10,507 --> 00:45:11,906
Yes, Julia.

522
00:45:12,042 --> 00:45:15,102
Heaven wouldn't be Heaven
without those we love.

523
00:45:15,679 --> 00:45:18,045
I wish I could feel that way.

524
00:45:18,182 --> 00:45:20,047
You can.

525
00:45:35,899 --> 00:45:39,733
Few in this world
have a correct understanding

526
00:45:39,870 --> 00:45:42,703
of the nature
and the character of God.

527
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:47,038
Many do not understand
their relationship to Him.

528
00:45:47,177 --> 00:45:49,975
I testify to you that they live.

529
00:45:50,814 --> 00:45:52,281
For I saw them.

530
00:45:52,616 --> 00:45:56,108
And I cannot deny it.

531
00:46:00,958 --> 00:46:04,291
Mama, look, it's as big as me.

532
00:46:04,628 --> 00:46:06,926
Remember what I told you, Julia.

533
00:46:07,064 --> 00:46:12,263
That's what happens when you plant
a seed and you take good care of it.

534
00:46:12,603 --> 00:46:15,037
It's called the law of the harvest.

535
00:46:15,172 --> 00:46:20,166
Even the smallest of seeds
can grow.

536
00:46:27,151 --> 00:46:29,619
Your mother has taught me
a few things.

537
00:46:29,753 --> 00:46:31,050
What?

538
00:46:31,188 --> 00:46:34,851
Well, for one thing,
you reap what you sow.

539
00:46:35,859 --> 00:46:40,796
You can't plant potatoes
and get pumpkins, young lady.

540
00:46:40,931 --> 00:46:43,161
Some of us tried to do that,
you know.

541
00:46:54,278 --> 00:46:56,007
I thought things
were supposed to be better

542
00:46:56,146 --> 00:46:58,307
once the temple was finished.

543
00:46:58,916 --> 00:47:00,816
So did I.

544
00:47:00,951 --> 00:47:04,318
But Joseph said just the opposite
would happen.

545
00:47:04,655 --> 00:47:07,590
<i>He said that the powers of darkness
would strive even harder</i>

546
00:47:07,724 --> 00:47:09,783
to stop the work.

547
00:47:09,927 --> 00:47:11,952
And they did.

548
00:47:12,763 --> 00:47:14,856
Even men of great faith,

549
00:47:14,998 --> 00:47:17,592
friends like Parley Pratt,

550
00:47:17,734 --> 00:47:20,931
even they began to have doubts.

551
00:47:22,172 --> 00:47:25,300
Some of us
have lost nearly everything.

552
00:47:26,109 --> 00:47:28,634
Is that what God wants?

553
00:47:28,779 --> 00:47:31,612
I say Joseph is a fallen prophet.

554
00:47:31,748 --> 00:47:33,978
What if he's right?

555
00:47:36,887 --> 00:47:41,790
Joseph's been called of God, Parley.
Nothing can change that.

556
00:47:42,226 --> 00:47:46,060
I say God has rejected him.

557
00:47:46,196 --> 00:47:47,163
If Joseph. . . .

558
00:47:47,297 --> 00:47:49,197
Pride can be such a difficult test.

559
00:47:49,333 --> 00:47:50,823
-It's true.
-That's right.

560
00:47:50,968 --> 00:47:55,371
You bore witness
that Joseph had been called of God.

561
00:47:55,706 --> 00:47:58,766
I felt the power of your faith.

562
00:47:58,909 --> 00:48:02,345
Perhaps we were both mistaken.

563
00:48:02,679 --> 00:48:04,340
No.

564
00:48:04,681 --> 00:48:06,273
You knew it.

565
00:48:06,416 --> 00:48:09,681
Now I know it as well.

566
00:48:12,823 --> 00:48:17,351
How could God let my wife die?

567
00:48:21,465 --> 00:48:29,031
First, Oliver and now. . .now Parley.
Who's next?

568
00:48:29,172 --> 00:48:31,663
Parley is speaking from anger.

569
00:48:31,808 --> 00:48:34,368
He doesn't mean it.

570
00:48:34,711 --> 00:48:38,203
Losing his wife so suddenly. . . .

571
00:48:38,348 --> 00:48:41,078
You know how that feels. . .

572
00:48:42,219 --> 00:48:45,382
. . .to lose someone that we love.

573
00:48:47,291 --> 00:48:51,057
The Lord said
I was to be a comfort to Joseph.

574
00:48:51,428 --> 00:48:55,455
But I was also to exhort the church.

575
00:48:55,799 --> 00:48:58,996
I resolved to do all that I could.

576
00:49:01,772 --> 00:49:04,036
Parley.

577
00:49:04,875 --> 00:49:08,402
Don't let sorrow rob you of faith.

578
00:49:09,379 --> 00:49:11,040
She wouldn't want that.

579
00:49:11,181 --> 00:49:15,174
Joseph told me
the Lord would bless us.

580
00:49:15,452 --> 00:49:16,851
I believed him.

581
00:49:19,923 --> 00:49:23,188
Then believe in him now.

582
00:49:26,296 --> 00:49:28,958
Sometimes
when trials overwhelm us,

583
00:49:29,099 --> 00:49:33,263
we forget that God is our friend.

584
00:49:33,403 --> 00:49:38,033
He always
has our best interest at heart.

585
00:49:44,948 --> 00:49:48,509
When the spirit of truth
touches your heart,

586
00:49:48,852 --> 00:49:51,753
then there is no room left for doubt.

587
00:49:56,493 --> 00:49:57,755
Joseph.

588
00:50:07,471 --> 00:50:10,872
When you told me
we were to build this temple,

589
00:50:11,008 --> 00:50:14,307
I marveled at your faith.

590
00:50:16,847 --> 00:50:19,873
Now I marvel even more.

591
00:50:24,588 --> 00:50:28,115
How can we leave it behind?

592
00:50:29,493 --> 00:50:32,223
There will be other temples.

593
00:50:36,433 --> 00:50:39,834
Will things be better in Missouri?

594
00:50:50,113 --> 00:50:53,981
Sometimes the river
seems so peaceful.

595
00:50:54,985 --> 00:50:59,445
But unseen, beneath the surface,

596
00:50:59,589 --> 00:51:04,492
it's eroding everything you work for,

597
00:51:04,628 --> 00:51:06,596
undercutting all your dreams.

598
00:51:33,156 --> 00:51:35,920
Missouri was supposed
to be the promised land.

599
00:51:36,059 --> 00:51:37,117
It was.

600
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:41,890
But something went terribly wrong.

601
00:51:42,032 --> 00:51:44,262
Instead, it became
a refiner's fire.

602
00:51:48,071 --> 00:51:51,165
Those were dark, dark days.

603
00:51:51,308 --> 00:51:54,277
And in the midst of such trials,

604
00:51:54,411 --> 00:51:58,108
you come to rely on strength
beyond your own.

605
00:51:58,248 --> 00:52:00,045
Everyone thinks I am strong.

606
00:52:02,319 --> 00:52:05,117
I don't feel strong.

607
00:52:08,492 --> 00:52:12,053
What's going to happen, Joseph?

608
00:52:19,336 --> 00:52:22,499
We will do the best that we can.

609
00:52:24,975 --> 00:52:27,671
And go on.

610
00:52:32,315 --> 00:52:36,513
These Mormons
are to be treated as enemies

611
00:52:36,653 --> 00:52:41,590
and must be exterminated
or driven from the state.

612
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:47,018
We only came because we had
your word of honor.

613
00:52:47,164 --> 00:52:49,632
Well, you, sir, 
were misinformed.

614
00:52:54,137 --> 00:52:57,368
Rumor and fear
only make things worse.

615
00:52:58,275 --> 00:53:01,472
False charges were raised,
and Joseph was betrayed.

616
00:53:04,147 --> 00:53:09,449
He was taken to await a trial
that never came.

617
00:53:10,086 --> 00:53:14,250
You're a glutton
for punishment, Smith.

618
00:53:31,641 --> 00:53:33,199
Hey, Joe!

619
00:53:33,343 --> 00:53:36,744
That wife of yours is mighty prissy!

620
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:41,483
-Yeah!
-But she won't be so proud for long!

621
00:53:52,329 --> 00:53:54,354
Smith!

622
00:53:54,497 --> 00:53:57,625
Get yourself up here.

623
00:54:02,739 --> 00:54:06,004
It's been weeks now, Joseph.

624
00:54:06,776 --> 00:54:09,176
How long?

625
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:11,469
I don't know.

626
00:54:15,752 --> 00:54:17,447
You're trembling.

627
00:54:17,587 --> 00:54:19,452
Don't. . . .

628
00:54:19,589 --> 00:54:22,319
Don't worry about me, Emma.

629
00:54:22,459 --> 00:54:23,790
How are the children?

630
00:54:24,127 --> 00:54:26,186
They miss you.

631
00:54:26,329 --> 00:54:28,422
Fredrick cries for you every night.

632
00:54:30,267 --> 00:54:35,364
Tell them that Father loves them
and prays for them.

633
00:54:35,505 --> 00:54:38,668
They need your prayers, Joseph.

634
00:54:38,808 --> 00:54:41,538
What they really need is you.

635
00:54:43,546 --> 00:54:45,673
And what about you, Emma?

636
00:54:47,150 --> 00:54:50,119
What do you need?

637
00:54:55,358 --> 00:54:57,588
It's not safe here anymore.

638
00:54:58,795 --> 00:55:01,662
I should take the children and go.

639
00:55:01,798 --> 00:55:02,822
Emma, go.

640
00:55:03,166 --> 00:55:04,258
But how can I leave you here?

641
00:55:04,401 --> 00:55:07,268
Go, by all means.
Leave as soon as you can.

642
00:55:12,309 --> 00:55:14,709
Has God forsaken us?

643
00:55:46,142 --> 00:55:49,407
No one but God
knows the feelings of my heart.

644
00:55:49,546 --> 00:55:55,348
As we left our home and almost all
of everything we possessed,

645
00:55:55,485 --> 00:55:58,181
we made our way out of the state.

646
00:56:05,628 --> 00:56:09,155
We crossed the river to Illinois.

647
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:13,365
But my heart kept looking back.

648
00:56:15,271 --> 00:56:18,900
People scattered like sheep,
left to the wolves.

649
00:56:19,242 --> 00:56:22,871
And all your talk of salvation
means nothing!

650
00:56:37,627 --> 00:56:41,461
Were it not for divine
mercy, Joseph,

651
00:56:41,598 --> 00:56:43,759
I should never have been able
to endure

652
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:47,563
the suffering I have passed through.

653
00:56:49,305 --> 00:56:55,574
Yet I am willing to suffer more
if it is the will of kind Heaven.

654
00:56:56,746 --> 00:57:00,477
My affectionate Emma.

655
00:57:00,617 --> 00:57:07,250
My heart is entwined around yours
forever and ever.

656
00:57:12,328 --> 00:57:17,664
Lucy says that when one door closes,
another eventually opens.

657
00:57:17,801 --> 00:57:19,894
When that door closes for me...

658
00:57:20,236 --> 00:57:21,794
You mustn't think such things.

659
00:57:21,938 --> 00:57:24,600
But I do.

660
00:57:25,408 --> 00:57:27,535
Lucy is a strong woman.

661
00:57:27,677 --> 00:57:29,770
But let me tell you the secret.

662
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:33,280
She relies on me. . .

663
00:57:34,017 --> 00:57:36,781
. . .almost as much as I rely on her.

664
00:57:40,023 --> 00:57:42,617
Promise me something.

665
00:57:42,759 --> 00:57:47,787
That when I'm gone,
she can rely on you.

666
00:57:49,566 --> 00:57:51,761
She can.

667
00:57:53,036 --> 00:57:56,528
Always.

668
00:57:57,507 --> 00:58:02,410
There's something I wanted
to read later to everyone that. . . .

669
00:58:02,745 --> 00:58:06,442
I think you need to hear it now.

670
00:58:10,887 --> 00:58:12,252
''Emma,

671
00:58:12,622 --> 00:58:15,887
I'm sending this epistle
to the church through you

672
00:58:16,025 --> 00:58:18,619
because I want you to read it first.

673
00:58:19,829 --> 00:58:25,927
All these things
shall give thee experience

674
00:58:26,069 --> 00:58:27,832
and shall be for thy good.

675
00:58:30,306 --> 00:58:39,010
Thine adversity and thine afflictions
shall be but a small moment.

676
00:58:39,349 --> 00:58:42,648
And then if thou undo it well,

677
00:58:42,785 --> 00:58:46,653
God shall exalt thee on high.

678
00:58:49,759 --> 00:58:52,387
The river, to me,

679
00:58:52,529 --> 00:58:57,967
seemed a barrier to the storm
which raged on the other side.

680
00:58:58,101 --> 00:59:01,696
I waited there for him.

681
00:59:04,607 --> 00:59:07,041
Emma.

682
00:59:09,746 --> 00:59:12,613
Joseph!

683
00:59:12,749 --> 00:59:15,912
You got away!

684
00:59:17,487 --> 00:59:20,047
They let us go.

685
00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:23,086
I promised myself
that whatever else came,

686
00:59:23,426 --> 00:59:26,229
I would not cross that river again.

687
00:59:34,737 --> 00:59:36,728
Have faith, brethren.

688
00:59:36,873 --> 00:59:39,569
''Nauvoo'' means ''beautiful place.''

689
00:59:56,526 --> 00:59:58,517
Emma.

690
01:00:01,397 --> 01:00:02,830
-Emma.
It's all right.

691
01:00:02,966 --> 01:00:04,024
It's all right.

692
01:00:04,167 --> 01:00:05,600
She's looking
after some of the others,

693
01:00:05,735 --> 01:00:06,997
and she asked me to look after you.

694
01:00:08,538 --> 01:00:11,098
Then I'll do my best to mind.

695
01:00:11,507 --> 01:00:14,704
I'm just going to say one thing,
brother Joseph.

696
01:00:14,844 --> 01:00:17,938
This place you brought us to
is certainly wet.

697
01:00:18,181 --> 01:00:21,582
My word, it's been raining
for three days straight.

698
01:00:22,752 --> 01:00:25,152
How many are sick?

699
01:00:25,488 --> 01:00:29,686
The whole house is full.
Not much of a house, though.

700
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:33,788
How many holes can one roof have?

701
01:00:35,965 --> 01:00:38,092
I guess I'd better get up.

702
01:00:40,036 --> 01:00:41,401
No, you don't.

703
01:00:42,005 --> 01:00:44,132
You are not going anywhere
until this fever breaks.

704
01:00:45,008 --> 01:00:46,532
Try not to get wet.

705
01:00:52,782 --> 01:00:54,909
You seem to be improving.

706
01:00:56,052 --> 01:01:01,854
I asked God to spare my life
so that I could ease your burdens

707
01:01:01,991 --> 01:01:03,891
and comfort your heart.

708
01:01:04,027 --> 01:01:05,790
Then do what I say.

709
01:01:08,965 --> 01:01:15,700
This place is not much now, Emma,
but it will get better.

710
01:01:16,906 --> 01:01:19,807
This will be a beautiful city,

711
01:01:19,942 --> 01:01:24,003
with fine houses and a temple.

712
01:01:25,615 --> 01:01:27,981
Be patient.

713
01:01:28,151 --> 01:01:30,085
It could be worse.

714
01:01:34,624 --> 01:01:36,819
I think it already is.

715
01:01:40,663 --> 01:01:44,224
Joseph had a clear vision
of the work he was to do.

716
01:01:44,567 --> 01:01:49,197
Nothing less than building up
the kingdom of God on the Earth.

717
01:01:50,707 --> 01:01:55,167
He shared that vision
with all who would listen.

718
01:01:55,912 --> 01:01:58,540
Here it comes!
Out of the way!

719
01:02:00,683 --> 01:02:04,483
We united our hearts
and our hands with the task.

720
01:02:04,620 --> 01:02:06,884
Make a note of it.

721
01:02:09,959 --> 01:02:12,257
Whoa, there!

722
01:02:14,230 --> 01:02:16,755
<i>I love it when you work
on our house.</i>

723
01:02:16,899 --> 01:02:19,060
Oh, thanks very much.

724
01:02:19,902 --> 01:02:22,871
Fix the roof,
and I'll fix your dinner.

725
01:02:23,005 --> 01:02:26,566
Ooh, it's a race, then.

726
01:02:34,016 --> 01:02:36,177
What do you think?

727
01:02:36,319 --> 01:02:38,253
I Iike it.

728
01:02:46,863 --> 01:02:49,661
I can hear my wife already.

729
01:02:57,807 --> 01:03:01,265
Thank you.
They are beautiful.

730
01:03:01,611 --> 01:03:04,171
That's why they made me
think of you.

731
01:03:13,122 --> 01:03:14,612
Samuel, over here!

732
01:03:14,757 --> 01:03:19,922
The truth of God will go forth,
boldly, nobly, and independent,

733
01:03:20,062 --> 01:03:22,553
until it has penetrated
every continent,

734
01:03:22,698 --> 01:03:24,666
sounded in every ear.

735
01:03:24,801 --> 01:03:27,634
And the purposes of God
shall be accomplished.

736
01:03:39,315 --> 01:03:40,213
Emma?

737
01:03:40,349 --> 01:03:42,840
Father's gone.

738
01:03:44,387 --> 01:03:47,788
I didn't even know.

739
01:03:54,297 --> 01:03:57,698
All I wanted was a chance
to make him proud.

740
01:04:04,707 --> 01:04:06,368
Emma.

741
01:04:06,709 --> 01:04:10,270
One day his eyes will be open.

742
01:04:10,413 --> 01:04:13,712
I think he will be proud of you.

743
01:04:14,784 --> 01:04:18,083
-It's too late.
-No, no, no.

744
01:04:20,923 --> 01:04:24,950
Emma, God can make things
right again.

745
01:04:36,038 --> 01:04:39,337
You can always come home.

746
01:04:39,842 --> 01:04:43,744
Mother died soon after Father.

747
01:04:44,714 --> 01:04:50,778
And there followed so much grief
that I felt something die in me.

748
01:04:51,120 --> 01:04:54,647
Sorrow can hollow you out inside,

749
01:04:54,790 --> 01:04:57,850
leave you empty, if you let it.

750
01:04:57,994 --> 01:05:02,795
. . .is the power of God unto salvation.

751
01:05:06,836 --> 01:05:08,394
Joseph.

752
01:05:09,105 --> 01:05:11,972
I see Alvin.

753
01:05:29,859 --> 01:05:34,057
God will not take
another of my children.

754
01:05:34,196 --> 01:05:36,096
Promise me.

755
01:05:51,914 --> 01:05:54,109
Emma is strong, Mother. . .

756
01:05:54,817 --> 01:05:56,978
. . .like you.

757
01:05:59,221 --> 01:06:05,023
Being strong
can be a very lonely thing.

758
01:06:38,461 --> 01:06:42,192
You will have your children again.

759
01:06:52,575 --> 01:06:58,514
I told the brethren that eternity
is like this ring.

760
01:06:59,382 --> 01:07:05,082
Without beginning and without end,
it goes on forever.

761
01:07:13,362 --> 01:07:14,920
The Lord
has made known unto me

762
01:07:15,064 --> 01:07:16,929
that the sisters
in the Kingdom of God

763
01:07:17,066 --> 01:07:20,058
should organize themselves together
as a society.

764
01:07:20,202 --> 01:07:23,933
And to lead this society,
to preside over it,

765
01:07:24,073 --> 01:07:27,201
the Lord has chosen Emma Smith.

766
01:07:35,251 --> 01:07:36,878
Sisters. . . .

767
01:07:38,387 --> 01:07:41,356
We are going to do
something extraordinary.

768
01:07:43,159 --> 01:07:46,128
We expect pressing calls,

769
01:07:46,262 --> 01:07:48,230
grand occasions.

770
01:07:49,065 --> 01:07:52,967
Each member
should be ambitious to do good.

771
01:07:53,569 --> 01:07:58,097
The Lord has said, ''When you're
in the service of your fellow beings,

772
01:07:58,240 --> 01:08:01,073
you're only in the service
of your God.''

773
01:08:03,212 --> 01:08:07,080
We will bring relief
to those who are in need.

774
01:08:07,216 --> 01:08:10,185
Emma, you're so kind to me.

775
01:08:11,921 --> 01:08:17,325
Heaven would not be Heaven
if you were not there.

776
01:08:19,061 --> 01:08:21,529
I feel the same way.

777
01:08:31,974 --> 01:08:34,101
Boys, shame on you!

778
01:08:34,243 --> 01:08:35,574
Shame, shame, shame!

779
01:08:35,911 --> 01:08:37,503
Now, you come inside right--

780
01:08:43,185 --> 01:08:44,243
Come on, boys!

781
01:08:54,096 --> 01:08:58,260
You speak your mind
almost as good as you cook.

782
01:08:58,400 --> 01:09:01,062
Most men are not ready for that.

783
01:09:01,203 --> 01:09:04,229
Well, sir, most men don't know
what they're missing.

784
01:09:06,575 --> 01:09:09,339
I'll just have another.

785
01:09:13,549 --> 01:09:16,017
-Candidates.
-Such an arrogant man.

786
01:09:16,152 --> 01:09:18,177
I suppose it does take
a certain kind of confidence

787
01:09:18,320 --> 01:09:19,981
to run for public office.

788
01:09:20,122 --> 01:09:22,522
You realize he only wants
to use your influence.

789
01:09:22,658 --> 01:09:25,024
I think we need
all the friends we can find.

790
01:09:25,161 --> 01:09:29,257
Real friends, Joseph.
Be careful.

791
01:09:29,698 --> 01:09:32,030
Don't let yourself trust
a man like that.

792
01:09:32,168 --> 01:09:33,965
Don't worry. I won't.

793
01:09:34,103 --> 01:09:36,628
He did like your fritters, though.

794
01:09:36,972 --> 01:09:38,234
He couldn't even remember
their name.

795
01:09:40,009 --> 01:09:42,136
Perhaps I should call them
something else

796
01:09:42,278 --> 01:09:44,974
in honor of the election.

797
01:09:45,114 --> 01:09:46,445
Candidates.

798
01:09:46,582 --> 01:09:47,514
Candidates?

799
01:09:47,650 --> 01:09:50,175
All puffed up and full of hot air.

800
01:09:53,088 --> 01:09:56,023
I always believed,
when you trust in the Lord,

801
01:09:56,158 --> 01:09:57,352
things work out.

802
01:09:57,493 --> 01:09:58,653
I see you've been shopping.

803
01:09:58,994 --> 01:10:01,087
But even as we were building,

804
01:10:01,230 --> 01:10:04,427
something else was tearing down.

805
01:10:15,744 --> 01:10:17,473
Miss Smith.

806
01:10:17,613 --> 01:10:18,705
Yes?

807
01:10:19,048 --> 01:10:21,710
I got a warrant here
to arrest Joe Smith.

808
01:10:22,051 --> 01:10:24,383
On what charge?

809
01:10:24,520 --> 01:10:28,684
There are some unanswered
questions in Missouri.

810
01:10:29,024 --> 01:10:31,390
My husband is not at home.

811
01:10:31,627 --> 01:10:34,187
What kind of a man
runs off and hides

812
01:10:34,330 --> 01:10:37,766
and leaves a pretty little woman
like you all alone?

813
01:10:39,702 --> 01:10:41,693
A woman like you needs protecting.

814
01:10:42,037 --> 01:10:44,767
Are you quite finished?

815
01:10:45,708 --> 01:10:48,006
For now.

816
01:10:58,187 --> 01:11:00,587
God gave Joseph a work to do.

817
01:11:00,723 --> 01:11:03,351
And all the powers
of Earth and hell combined

818
01:11:03,492 --> 01:11:06,655
could not keep him from doing it.

819
01:11:13,068 --> 01:11:15,696
Very, very good.

820
01:11:15,838 --> 01:11:18,500
Very good.

821
01:12:07,489 --> 01:12:09,184
You nearly scared me to death.

822
01:12:09,325 --> 01:12:10,656
I scared you?

823
01:12:10,793 --> 01:12:14,092
I'm an unarmed man.

824
01:12:14,229 --> 01:12:17,460
Emma, honestly, a hairbrush.

825
01:12:20,769 --> 01:12:24,728
Danger or no, I just had to see you.

826
01:12:29,778 --> 01:12:32,747
-That thing's not loaded, is it?
-No.

827
01:12:34,216 --> 01:12:37,811
I wanted to give
each of the children a blessing.

828
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:40,511
Don't wake them.

829
01:12:42,391 --> 01:12:44,586
Just let her sleep.

830
01:12:44,727 --> 01:12:48,219
She's beautiful, isn't she?

831
01:12:52,935 --> 01:12:57,702
Dear Lord, bless this sweet girl.

832
01:12:59,375 --> 01:13:01,343
Help her to do Thy will.

833
01:13:01,477 --> 01:13:04,537
Help her to know of Thy love.

834
01:13:05,514 --> 01:13:09,177
Your father
believed in you, Julia.

835
01:13:09,318 --> 01:13:10,876
So do I.

836
01:13:16,692 --> 01:13:18,887
I never knew.

837
01:13:23,632 --> 01:13:26,260
They'll be watching the house.

838
01:13:26,402 --> 01:13:28,597
I better go.

839
01:13:28,737 --> 01:13:31,467
I wrote a letter to the governor.

840
01:13:31,607 --> 01:13:34,269
Maybe hell intervene.

841
01:13:36,712 --> 01:13:39,203
God is my friend, Emma.

842
01:13:39,348 --> 01:13:41,646
And He is yours.

843
01:13:43,786 --> 01:13:46,346
Give this to the brethren?

844
01:13:46,488 --> 01:13:49,582
But I want you to read it first.

845
01:14:00,536 --> 01:14:02,731
I Iove you.

846
01:14:03,472 --> 01:14:05,872
Never forget that.

847
01:14:12,414 --> 01:14:15,645
''What do we hear in the Gospel
which we have received?

848
01:14:15,784 --> 01:14:20,687
A voice of gladness,
a voice of mercy from Heaven.

849
01:14:21,623 --> 01:14:24,854
Glad tidings
for the living and the dead.

850
01:14:24,993 --> 01:14:28,690
Shall we not go on
in so great a cause?''

851
01:14:31,867 --> 01:14:34,392
Why can't good things last?

852
01:14:34,536 --> 01:14:36,003
They can.

853
01:14:36,338 --> 01:14:38,829
That's what Joseph
was trying to teach us.

854
01:14:38,974 --> 01:14:41,704
There is no end to hope, Julia.

855
01:14:41,844 --> 01:14:45,302
There is no end to love.

856
01:14:45,848 --> 01:14:50,547
Lucy, why does the Lord
want us to build another temple?

857
01:14:50,686 --> 01:14:54,520
He wants us to have
a fullness of joy.

858
01:14:54,656 --> 01:14:59,389
And that can only come
through the blessings of the temple.

859
01:14:59,661 --> 01:15:02,858
Joseph was called to teach us that.

860
01:15:07,002 --> 01:15:09,869
Some things are very clear now.

861
01:15:12,641 --> 01:15:15,974
It may seem to some
a very bold doctrine.

862
01:15:16,311 --> 01:15:19,974
Power which can bind on Earth
and in Heaven.

863
01:15:21,617 --> 01:15:24,643
God has restored
that authority again.

864
01:15:24,786 --> 01:15:27,653
In a temple, we can receive
all the ordinances of salvation,

865
01:15:27,789 --> 01:15:31,281
not only for ourselves. . .

866
01:15:31,560 --> 01:15:35,496
. . .but for those
who have died without them.

867
01:15:40,836 --> 01:15:43,327
So what have you been up to?

868
01:15:43,472 --> 01:15:44,700
Wrote another letter
to the governor.

869
01:15:44,840 --> 01:15:45,898
-Another?

870
01:15:46,041 --> 01:15:47,440
That's very ambitious.

871
01:15:47,576 --> 01:15:51,512
I intend to plow with a racehorse.
You better hold on real tight, Joseph.

872
01:15:51,647 --> 01:15:52,773
Don't mind if I do.

873
01:15:55,918 --> 01:15:57,818
Brothers and sisters,

874
01:15:57,953 --> 01:16:00,649
it is one
of the Lord's greatest blessings,

875
01:16:00,789 --> 01:16:03,917
the most beautiful aspect
of His plan of salvation,

876
01:16:04,059 --> 01:16:09,395
that the relationships we form
on Earth carry on into the next life,

877
01:16:09,531 --> 01:16:13,558
that a man and a wife, joined
by the power of the holy priesthood,

878
01:16:13,702 --> 01:16:15,966
can be joined in eternity.

879
01:16:16,104 --> 01:16:20,063
By the authority vested in me,
I now pronounce you, Joseph Smith,

880
01:16:20,409 --> 01:16:26,109
and you, Emma Hale Smith,
sealed for time and for all eternity.

881
01:16:26,915 --> 01:16:28,849
Forever.

882
01:16:37,059 --> 01:16:38,788
You're counting again.

883
01:16:38,927 --> 01:16:40,087
Be grateful.

884
01:16:40,429 --> 01:16:43,455
If I don't, we'll both be dancing
on your feet.

885
01:16:46,902 --> 01:16:50,360
Do not underestimate
these men, Joseph.

886
01:16:50,505 --> 01:16:53,372
They will stop at nothing.

887
01:16:55,043 --> 01:16:57,511
They intend to destroy you.

888
01:16:57,646 --> 01:16:59,580
Hold it right there, Smith.

889
01:16:59,715 --> 01:17:02,707
Don't move, or you're a dead man.

890
01:17:02,851 --> 01:17:04,648
You're gonna shoot me?

891
01:17:04,786 --> 01:17:07,619
We're taking you
back to Missouri for good.

892
01:17:07,756 --> 01:17:09,121
Don't move.

893
01:17:11,493 --> 01:17:14,860
Joseph!

894
01:17:19,635 --> 01:17:22,695
We need a place to stay, old man.

895
01:17:31,546 --> 01:17:37,712
Seems to me,
if you were really a prophet,

896
01:17:37,853 --> 01:17:41,414
God ought to be taking
better care of you.

897
01:17:42,190 --> 01:17:45,489
He has blessed me
more than you know.

898
01:17:47,129 --> 01:17:49,063
Don't look that way to me.

899
01:17:55,704 --> 01:17:58,138
Sometimes fear
shouts so loud in our ears

900
01:17:58,473 --> 01:18:03,069
that it almost drowns out our faith.

901
01:18:06,248 --> 01:18:09,945
But God knows who we are, Julia.

902
01:18:11,687 --> 01:18:14,747
We cannot go anywhere
that He cannot find us.

903
01:18:18,126 --> 01:18:20,754
Come on, boys!

904
01:18:27,803 --> 01:18:30,704
Stop the wagon!
Hold it right there!

905
01:18:33,942 --> 01:18:35,500
Well, gentlemen,

906
01:18:35,644 --> 01:18:38,943
looks like I won't be going
with you to Missouri today.

907
01:18:39,181 --> 01:18:41,945
But just to show
there are no hard feelings,

908
01:18:42,084 --> 01:18:43,676
why don't you be my guests tonight?

909
01:18:45,954 --> 01:18:48,718
That means he'll be going to dinner.

910
01:18:51,660 --> 01:18:55,187
Life is like the river, Julia.

911
01:18:55,530 --> 01:18:59,694
Sometimes it sweeps you
gently along.

912
01:18:59,835 --> 01:19:03,134
Sometimes the rapids
come out of nowhere.

913
01:19:04,306 --> 01:19:05,933
The revelation
on plural marriage

914
01:19:06,074 --> 01:19:09,703
was one of those rapids,
wasn't it, Mother?

915
01:19:12,547 --> 01:19:15,812
How can you ignore something
that hurt you so much?

916
01:19:15,951 --> 01:19:20,650
I don't speak of it,
but I have never ignored it.

917
01:19:21,690 --> 01:19:23,555
Then why the silence?

918
01:19:23,692 --> 01:19:26,661
What good
would speaking of it do?

919
01:19:26,795 --> 01:19:29,787
It flew in the face of everything
that was dear to us,

920
01:19:29,931 --> 01:19:31,990
all that we meant to each other.

921
01:19:32,134 --> 01:19:34,193
Then why did you allow it?

922
01:19:34,336 --> 01:19:36,998
Because it was the price of faith.

923
01:19:37,139 --> 01:19:40,575
God commanded,
and Joseph obeyed.

924
01:19:41,877 --> 01:19:44,903
And it nearly broke both our hearts.

925
01:19:47,649 --> 01:19:51,312
Some say that there
were other reasons.

926
01:19:51,653 --> 01:19:54,213
They say Father
was a fallen prophet.

927
01:19:54,356 --> 01:19:57,189
Well, peopIe say all kinds of things.

928
01:19:57,325 --> 01:19:59,919
But, Julia, I know better.

929
01:20:00,061 --> 01:20:03,997
Joseph taught what God revealed,
nothing more.

930
01:20:04,132 --> 01:20:07,329
He sealed that witness with his life.

931
01:20:21,049 --> 01:20:23,040
Emma. . . .

932
01:20:24,119 --> 01:20:29,785
The Lord is going to let me rest
for a while.

933
01:20:34,729 --> 01:20:36,720
Joseph. . . .

934
01:20:40,635 --> 01:20:42,364
No.

935
01:20:43,772 --> 01:20:45,831
No.

936
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:54,708
Emma.

937
01:20:57,953 --> 01:20:59,978
There comes a time for all of us

938
01:21:00,121 --> 01:21:03,648
when we must be more than we are.

939
01:21:04,092 --> 01:21:08,188
We must follow the course
which God has laid out.

940
01:21:09,931 --> 01:21:11,922
They're making us out to be fools.

941
01:21:12,067 --> 01:21:14,900
Opposition was coming
from every direction.

942
01:21:15,036 --> 01:21:17,937
We didn't know
who we could trust anymore.

943
01:21:18,073 --> 01:21:20,098
That was the greatest test.

944
01:21:20,242 --> 01:21:23,905
You've come this far!
You know better than that!

945
01:21:26,948 --> 01:21:31,908
Joseph talked of going away,
finding a new home in the West.

946
01:21:32,053 --> 01:21:36,114
He started out,
but the people were alarmed.

947
01:21:36,258 --> 01:21:39,694
I could not bear the thought
of him saying he'd run away.

948
01:21:39,828 --> 01:21:43,730
So I wrote him a letter.

949
01:21:43,865 --> 01:21:46,732
I asked him to come back.

950
01:21:47,369 --> 01:21:52,204
If you could,
what would you change?

951
01:21:57,946 --> 01:21:59,971
Me.

952
01:22:00,282 --> 01:22:02,910
I would change me.

953
01:22:06,121 --> 01:22:08,055
<i>That's the way the money goes</i>

954
01:22:08,189 --> 01:22:10,316
<i>Pop goes the weasel</i>

955
01:22:10,458 --> 01:22:13,086
-Excuse me.
-Very good.

956
01:22:19,801 --> 01:22:21,291
She has a gift with the children.

957
01:22:21,436 --> 01:22:24,166
-She has a gift to love.

958
01:22:24,306 --> 01:22:27,002
I would be willing to walk
through hell itself,

959
01:22:27,142 --> 01:22:30,737
barefoot, if necessary,
for a woman like that.

960
01:22:32,814 --> 01:22:35,783
Are you afraid to go to Carthage?

961
01:22:36,952 --> 01:22:38,977
Are you?

962
01:22:40,422 --> 01:22:42,287
A little.

963
01:22:45,527 --> 01:22:47,791
So am I.

964
01:23:05,013 --> 01:23:07,072
It's after midnight.

965
01:23:08,183 --> 01:23:10,743
I can't sleep.

966
01:23:11,286 --> 01:23:13,846
Neither can I.

967
01:23:19,828 --> 01:23:22,956
What's going to happen, Joseph?

968
01:23:24,532 --> 01:23:28,161
Whatever happens, the Lord is in it.

969
01:23:30,205 --> 01:23:35,233
Emma, this work,
the revelations, the temple. . . .

970
01:23:37,345 --> 01:23:42,806
It's all about bringing together
the people that we love.

971
01:23:44,452 --> 01:23:49,446
It's about learning to turn our hearts
toward each other.

972
01:23:50,558 --> 01:23:53,026
We cannot know at the present

973
01:23:53,161 --> 01:23:56,790
the blessings
which God has in store for us.

974
01:23:59,434 --> 01:24:01,026
Emma?

975
01:24:02,871 --> 01:24:04,930
Emma?

976
01:24:05,907 --> 01:24:11,277
If we are faithful,
all of our losses will be made up.

977
01:24:28,997 --> 01:24:34,958
Before you go tomorrow,
will you give me a blessing then?

978
01:24:39,007 --> 01:24:41,475
I have a better idea.

979
01:24:44,245 --> 01:24:50,081
You write down the blessing
that you desire, and I will sign it.

980
01:24:50,919 --> 01:24:53,479
And it will be yours.

981
01:24:53,621 --> 01:24:56,920
Exactly as you wish.

982
01:25:01,629 --> 01:25:04,257
You are coming back.

983
01:25:04,399 --> 01:25:07,562
I look forward
to reading that blessing.

984
01:25:29,491 --> 01:25:32,119
I used to pretend
Father would come back.

985
01:25:33,461 --> 01:25:36,897
I'd wait for hours by the window.

986
01:25:37,499 --> 01:25:40,195
I just wanted things
to be the same again.

987
01:25:40,668 --> 01:25:43,034
But they never were.

988
01:25:44,005 --> 01:25:46,337
How could they?

989
01:25:48,510 --> 01:25:51,206
Part of you went with him.

990
01:26:08,530 --> 01:26:11,055
Remember what Father said,

991
01:26:11,199 --> 01:26:16,136
that God chooses the crucible
in which we are tried.

992
01:26:17,172 --> 01:26:21,233
I'm beginning to understand
what that means, Mother.

993
01:26:21,976 --> 01:26:25,412
But I still wish I had your strength.

994
01:26:25,547 --> 01:26:28,482
Strength isn't something you have.

995
01:26:28,616 --> 01:26:33,076
It's something God helps you find.

996
01:26:33,221 --> 01:26:41,094
And usually we have to find it, Julia,
one day at a time.

997
01:26:49,070 --> 01:26:52,005
Mother wrote out the blessing.

998
01:26:52,140 --> 01:26:55,075
I desire the spirit of God

999
01:26:55,210 --> 01:27:00,170
to know and understand myself.

1000
01:27:04,419 --> 01:27:06,148
I hope to perform all the work

1001
01:27:06,287 --> 01:27:10,087
that I covenanted to do
in the spirit world.

1002
01:27:14,796 --> 01:27:18,425
That I may be able to comprehend
the designs of God

1003
01:27:18,566 --> 01:27:20,557
without doubting.

1004
01:27:25,173 --> 01:27:30,577
I hope to be able to acknowledge
the hand of God in all things.

1005
01:27:39,087 --> 01:27:44,423
I desire with all my heart to honor
and respect my husband.

1006
01:27:45,827 --> 01:27:48,796
I hope to be able to retain the place

1007
01:27:49,130 --> 01:27:52,622
which God has given me
by His side.''

1008
01:27:54,836 --> 01:27:57,134
Father said
that the Lord will judge us all

1009
01:27:57,272 --> 01:28:01,504
according to the desires
of our hearts.

1010
01:28:03,845 --> 01:28:06,678
As I look back on Mother's life,

1011
01:28:06,814 --> 01:28:12,184
I believe that the blessing
she wanted

1012
01:28:12,420 --> 01:28:15,389
is already hers.

1013
01:28:23,197 --> 01:28:26,360
There is no end to hope, Julia.

1014
01:28:26,501 --> 01:28:29,129
There is no end to love.

1015
01:29:49,283 --> 01:29:54,721
<i>The distance between us</i>

1016
01:29:54,856 --> 01:30:01,386
<i>The stretches of pain</i>

1017
01:30:01,529 --> 01:30:05,590
<i>Will not divide us</i>

1018
01:30:05,733 --> 01:30:09,567
<i>l remain</i>

1019
01:30:12,907 --> 01:30:18,311
<i>The hands of injustice</i>

1020
01:30:18,446 --> 01:30:23,679
<i>That took you away</i>

1021
01:30:23,818 --> 01:30:28,187
<i>Can't separate us</i>

1022
01:30:28,322 --> 01:30:32,258
<i>l remain</i>

1023
01:30:34,896 --> 01:30:40,630
<i>Through walls and bars
and running streams</i>

1024
01:30:40,768 --> 01:30:46,468
<i>Over rising hills
and sinking valleys</i>

1025
01:30:46,607 --> 01:30:51,806
<i>With God as our strength
to carry us through</i>

1026
01:30:51,946 --> 01:31:02,288
<i>Oh, l remain because of you</i>
