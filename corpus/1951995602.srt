Welcome back to

00:00:13,813 --> 00:00:16,111
<i>Eye on East Hills</i>
<i>with Jon Howard.</i>

3
00:00:16,182 --> 00:00:17,513
(Christopher)
Look, people think

4
00:00:17,584 --> 00:00:18,744
that sports is fair,
you know,

5
00:00:18,818 --> 00:00:20,217
just 'cause it got rules
and stuff.

6
00:00:20,286 --> 00:00:22,083
You know,
but is it fair that,

7
00:00:22,155 --> 00:00:24,487
you know,
Chinese people are short

8
00:00:24,557 --> 00:00:27,253
or, you know, we have fewer
fast-twitch muscles in our legs?

9
00:00:27,327 --> 00:00:28,760
How do you explain
Yao Ming then?

10
00:00:28,828 --> 00:00:32,559
Yao Ming is a statistical
anomaly, all right?

11
00:00:32,632 --> 00:00:35,760
You take a country
of 1.4 billion people,

12
00:00:35,835 --> 00:00:38,633
you're sure to have a few
hundred tall [...], right?

13
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:40,195
And out of that few hundred,
you know,

14
00:00:40,273 --> 00:00:42,537
you're bound to have at least
one or two that can play ball.

15
00:00:42,609 --> 00:00:43,837
Statistical anomaly.

16
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:45,434
[Man singing]
Never seen Charlie Chan.

17
00:00:45,512 --> 00:00:46,706
Never forget Vincent Chin.

18
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:48,304
I'm 'bout to drop
some knowledge on you.

19
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:49,678
Let the lesson begin.

20
00:00:49,749 --> 00:00:51,580
Now, I'ma teach
this assignment in slang,

21
00:00:51,651 --> 00:00:53,551
brother, change
the whole world to see shit

22
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:55,178
like <i>The Eye</i>
by the Pang brothers.

23
00:00:55,255 --> 00:00:57,155
Asian American
who ain't afraid to say

24
00:00:57,223 --> 00:00:58,713
comparing me
to David Carradine

25
00:00:58,792 --> 00:01:00,692
will get you set ablaze
with kerosene.

26
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:02,591
I don't call
television racist,

27
00:01:02,662 --> 00:01:04,562
but I do watch <i>The Simpsons</i>
and <i>SpongeBob</i>

28
00:01:04,631 --> 00:01:06,565
just to see
some yellow faces.

29
00:01:06,633 --> 00:01:08,658
I take the yellow haters
down like elevators.

30
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:09,827
Left hand on your girl.

31
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:11,928
Right foot
on the accelerator.

32
00:01:12,005 --> 00:01:13,029
You ain't laughing at that.

33
00:01:13,106 --> 00:01:14,630
I'm that new type of Asian.

34
00:01:14,707 --> 00:01:16,402
I'll let you
do the math on that one.

35
00:01:16,476 --> 00:01:17,704
I'ma teach you who's me

36
00:01:17,777 --> 00:01:19,301
'cause I'm the Bruce Lee
of loose-leaf,

37
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:20,346
the Donnie N. Of rhyming,

38
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:21,778
and the Jackie Chan
of rapping, man.

39
00:01:21,848 --> 00:01:24,408

Orient Express coming through!

40
00:01:24,484 --> 00:01:26,281
[Man singing]
Forget what
you think you know.

41
00:01:26,352 --> 00:01:27,842
I'll teach
your ashes a lesson.

42
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:30,151
Listen and learn
and don't ask me no questions.

43
00:01:30,223 --> 00:01:32,748
Wake up, kids, and keep
your eyes in my direction.

44
00:01:32,826 --> 00:01:34,418
Welcome
to my Chinese school.

45

00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:58,713
(boy)
You're awesome.
You should be in the NBA.

49
00:01:58,785 --> 00:01:59,809
My name's Felix.

50
00:01:59,886 --> 00:02:01,012
(Christopher)
Good for you.

51
00:02:01,087 --> 00:02:02,486
Hey, hook me up
with some of that, man.

52
00:02:02,555 --> 00:02:03,920
(boy #1)
Shot was off.

53
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:06,618
(boy #2)
The big guy made a bunch
of lucky shots anyway.

54
00:02:06,693 --> 00:02:08,422
(Christopher)
W-w-wait, hold up, dog.

55
00:02:08,495 --> 00:02:10,827
Hey, you want
to run that back?

56
00:02:10,897 --> 00:02:13,627
Ball.

65

Where you going?

That's where you're going.

76
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:52,065
Who's lucky now, huh?

77

Aw, yeah.

80
00:03:01,047 --> 00:03:02,014
Yeah, you better step off.

81
00:03:02,081 --> 00:03:04,276
Hey, this is my neighborhood.

82
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:05,476

Call me C-Dub.

87
00:03:10,156 --> 00:03:12,283
And what time is it?

(Felix)
3:35.

89
00:03:13,726 --> 00:03:15,785

Dog, dog, when I ask you
what time it is,

90
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:17,921
you're supposed to say
"game time," all right?

91
00:03:17,997 --> 00:03:19,055
Wait, wait,
what time is it?

92

Game time.

All right, man,
I'm sorry I'm late, man.

97
00:03:33,146 --> 00:03:35,341
There was this big-ass accident
on the 405, man.

98
00:03:35,415 --> 00:03:37,212
This mofo was speeding,
picking his nose, man.

99
00:03:37,283 --> 00:03:39,410
His ass ran, pow, right into
the back of a chicken truck.

100
00:03:39,485 --> 00:03:40,782
Man, I saw blood.

101

<i>feathers, everywhere, man.</i>

<i>I'm telling you, J.P.,</i>

103
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:46,554
you should've seen
this <i>wang ba dan,</i> man.

104
00:03:46,626 --> 00:03:48,651
He might as well have been down
on his hands and knees.

105
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:49,695
He was begging me to stay.

106
00:03:49,762 --> 00:03:51,161
I swear on the grace

107
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:52,789
of 18 generations
of my ancestors, man.

108
00:03:52,865 --> 00:03:54,230
I ain't gonna be
late again.

109
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,325
All right, you can't get
a better guarantee than that

110
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:57,664
from a Chinese brother.

111
00:03:57,737 --> 00:03:59,364
(J.P.)
You know what
you had to do, right?

112
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:00,406
Don't playa-hate.

Negotiate.

114
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:02,974
(C-Dub)
For sure, so check it.

115
00:04:03,042 --> 00:04:05,567
This fool starts talking fast
about bonuses, vacation days.

116
00:04:05,645 --> 00:04:07,272
Man, he tried
to straight-up bribe me.

117
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:09,144
I'll give you my autographed
Michael Jordan jersey, man.

118
00:04:09,215 --> 00:04:10,375
You know how much
that's worth?

119
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:11,644
Really?

120
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:13,481
All right, maybe I ain't
going to give you that,

121
00:04:13,553 --> 00:04:15,418
but, hey, I'll give you
my Larry Johnson jersey.

Who?

123
00:04:16,723 --> 00:04:18,588
You know, UNLV, Charlotte
Hornets, Grandma-ma.

124
00:04:18,658 --> 00:04:20,455
Come on, man.
I'll wash your car, man.

125
00:04:20,526 --> 00:04:21,652
(J.P.)
Right, r-r-r-right.

126
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:22,695
So you had to show him

127
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:24,195
who was the real
<i>lao fan,</i> huh?

128
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:26,630
(C-Dub)
Oh, man, you know it, baby.
Set the record straight.

129

There's like 2 million of us
in L.A., man.

to communicate with them?

(C-Dub)
I was thinking, man.

138
00:04:44,484 --> 00:04:46,281
Can't be wasting all my time
working for the man.

139
00:04:46,352 --> 00:04:47,376
(J.P.)
Right.

140
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:48,715
You know that comic book
I was working on,

141
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:50,346
the one with the gun-toting,
crime-fighting pandas?

142
00:04:50,423 --> 00:04:51,754
That's where I need
to devote more of my time.

143
00:04:51,824 --> 00:04:53,815
Yeah, and don't forget
about our T-shirt company.

144
00:04:53,893 --> 00:04:55,326
(C-Dub)
That's what I'm saying, man.

145
00:04:55,395 --> 00:04:57,022
And then
there's the casino.

146
00:04:57,096 --> 00:04:58,791

Aw, can't forget
the crown jewel.

the Donald says?

153
00:05:06,906 --> 00:05:09,136
(C-Dub)
Ah, wait,
you can't fire me, dog.

154
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:12,507
- Oh, really?
- Yeah, 'cause I quit.

155
00:05:18,751 --> 00:05:20,218
Hm.

Oh, you're too polite.

158
00:05:45,311 --> 00:05:46,835
I'm just a lousy player.

159
00:05:46,913 --> 00:05:50,144
Not everybody can play
like that guy.

160

Hey, Pa, I fixed your modem.

<i>about going wireless, though.</i>

162

It's a lot faster.

Hey, Michael,
you remember Mr. Lin?

164

Oh, of course.

You training hard?

167
00:06:04,263 --> 00:06:05,230
Not that you need to.

168
00:06:05,298 --> 00:06:06,731
You could probably win
blindfolded.

169
00:06:06,799 --> 00:06:07,993
(Michael)
I'm just very lucky.

170
00:06:08,067 --> 00:06:09,466
I definitely
should practice more.

171

(Lin)
Oh, I don't see how
you could find the time.

172

I got a nephew
in residency at General.

01:31:58,946 --> 01:32:01,141
'Cause if it ain't sugary,
it ain't no good.

1845
01:32:01,215 --> 01:32:02,648
I hate
health food cereals.

1846
01:32:02,717 --> 01:32:04,548
They taste like wood.

1847
01:32:04,619 --> 01:32:07,679
I like, I like,
I like cereal.

1848
01:32:07,755 --> 01:32:09,416
I eat my Wheaties
for breakfast.

1849
01:32:09,490 --> 01:32:11,685
No one can mess with
the champ.

1850
01:32:11,759 --> 01:32:13,090
I'm the champ.
Oh, yes.

1851
01:32:13,160 --> 01:32:14,320
Today I'm a winner.

1852
01:32:14,395 --> 01:32:15,760
I'll eat you
for dinner.

1853
01:32:15,830 --> 01:32:18,128
I'm a champ.
I'm a champ.

1854
01:32:18,199 --> 01:32:19,359
God gave me talent.

1855
01:32:19,433 --> 01:32:20,866
I'm a super machine.

1856
01:32:20,935 --> 01:32:23,165
I'm better than the dudes
that I see on TV.

1857
01:32:23,237 --> 01:32:24,397
I'm a champ,
Mama said.

1858
01:32:24,472 --> 01:32:25,632
I'm a champ,
Papa said.

1859
01:32:25,706 --> 01:32:26,832
I'm a champ,
you'll see.

1860
01:32:26,908 --> 01:32:28,432
I'm a champ,
goddamn.

1861
01:32:28,509 --> 01:32:29,533
I'm rated number one

1862
01:32:29,610 --> 01:32:31,077
at the top of the game.

1863
01:32:31,145 --> 01:32:32,112
Hey, the dynasty's begun.

1864
01:32:32,179 --> 01:32:33,373
Ain't no stopping
this reign.

1865
01:32:33,447 --> 01:32:34,505
Better recognize the face,

1866
01:32:34,582 --> 01:32:35,776
start jocking the name.

1867
01:32:35,850 --> 01:32:37,044
With my whole line of shoes,

1868
01:32:37,118 --> 01:32:38,346
watch 'em
walkin' the Js.

1869
01:32:38,419 --> 01:32:41,047
Oh, I'm something special,
one of a kind.

1870
01:32:41,122 --> 01:32:42,111
Got my big bowl of Wheaties.

1871
01:32:42,189 --> 01:32:43,315
I was born to fly

1872
01:32:43,391 --> 01:32:45,882
Yes, I'm extra lifted,
extra gifted.

1873
01:32:45,960 --> 01:32:48,554
I'm going down in history
frozen in time.

1874
01:32:48,629 --> 01:32:49,721
Got trophies
by the dozens

1875
01:32:49,797 --> 01:32:51,059
and medals to count.

1876
01:32:51,132 --> 01:32:53,464
And I'm on your television show
and off my house.

1877
01:32:53,534 --> 01:32:54,728
Everybody wants to see me.

1878
01:32:54,802 --> 01:32:55,928
I'm the talk of the town.

1879
01:32:56,003 --> 01:32:57,265
Just the life
of a champ.

1880
01:32:57,338 --> 01:32:58,464
Take a look
at me now.

1881
01:32:58,539 --> 01:33:00,006
I eat my Wheaties
for breakfast.

1882
01:33:00,074 --> 01:33:02,474
No one can mess with
the champ.

1883
01:33:02,543 --> 01:33:03,874
I'm a champ.
Oh, yes.

1884
01:33:03,945 --> 01:33:04,912
Today I'm a winner.

1885
01:33:04,979 --> 01:33:06,139
I'll eat you
for dinner.

1886
01:33:06,213 --> 01:33:08,909
I'm a champ.
I'm a champ.

1887
01:33:08,983 --> 01:33:10,109
God gave me talent.

1888
01:33:10,184 --> 01:33:11,651
I'm a super machine.

1889
01:33:11,719 --> 01:33:13,949
I'm better than the dudes
that I see on TV.

1890
01:33:14,021 --> 01:33:15,181
I'm a champ,
Mama said.

1891
01:33:15,256 --> 01:33:16,416
I'm a champ,
Papa said.

1892
01:33:16,490 --> 01:33:17,616
I'm a champ,
you'll see.

1893
01:33:17,692 --> 01:33:18,852
I'm a champ,
goddamn.

1894
01:33:18,926 --> 01:33:20,223
I feel great
in the morning

1895
01:33:20,294 --> 01:33:21,454
when I wake up.

1896
01:33:21,529 --> 01:33:23,394
I'm a man on a mission
with no makeup.

1897
01:33:23,464 --> 01:33:26,592
I got lots to do today,
like find the right girl,

1898
01:33:26,667 --> 01:33:28,862
get my oil changed,
and take over the world.

1899
01:33:28,936 --> 01:33:31,803
See, everything you do,
I bet I could do it better.

1900
01:33:31,872 --> 01:33:34,136
If you climb a hill,
I'll climb the Staples Center.

1901
01:33:34,208 --> 01:33:36,540
If you say "what,"
then I'ma say "whatever."

1902
01:33:36,611 --> 01:33:37,771
And if you
got the cheese,

1903
01:33:37,845 --> 01:33:39,073
then I'ma bring it better.

1904
01:33:39,146 --> 01:33:41,205
See, I don't even stop
at a stop sign.

1905
01:33:41,282 --> 01:33:44,080
With a off rhyme,
I can still sound dope on time.

1906
01:33:44,151 --> 01:33:46,551
I can sound proper.
I can sound unsigned.

1907
01:33:46,621 --> 01:33:48,953
Don't step to your man.
He's a land mine.

1908
01:33:49,023 --> 01:33:50,718
I eat my Wheaties
for breakfast.

1909
01:33:50,791 --> 01:33:52,952
No one can mess with
the champ.

1910
01:33:53,027 --> 01:33:54,358
I'm a champ.
Oh, yes.

1911
01:33:54,428 --> 01:33:55,395
Today I'm a winner.

1912
01:33:55,463 --> 01:33:56,657
I'll eat you
for dinner.

1913
01:33:56,731 --> 01:33:59,393
I'm a champ.
I'm a champ.

1914
01:33:59,467 --> 01:34:00,627
God gave me talent.

1915
01:34:00,701 --> 01:34:02,032
I'm a super machine.

1916
01:34:02,103 --> 01:34:04,435
I'm better than the dudes
that I see on TV.

1917
01:34:04,505 --> 01:34:05,665
I'm a champ,
Mama said.

1918
01:34:05,740 --> 01:34:06,900
I'm a champ,
Papa said.

1919
01:34:06,974 --> 01:34:07,963
I'm a champ,
you'll see.

1920
01:34:08,042 --> 01:34:09,304
I'm a champ,
goddamn.

1921
01:34:09,377 --> 01:34:12,005
Too short to be a baller, nope,
let alone a starter.

1922
01:34:12,079 --> 01:34:13,011
Warming up the bench,

1923
01:34:13,080 --> 01:34:14,604
I got it hotter
than a sauna.

1924
01:34:14,682 --> 01:34:17,150
Never getting called 'cause
I was skinny like my mama.

1925
01:34:17,218 --> 01:34:19,686
Couldn't land a chick
because my daddy sang opera.

1926
01:34:19,754 --> 01:34:21,984
Had a lot of time to think
stuffed inside my locker.

1927
01:34:22,056 --> 01:34:23,182
Penny for my thoughts,

1928
01:34:23,257 --> 01:34:24,724
then I'd have
a million dollars.

1929
01:34:24,792 --> 01:34:27,317
Didn't like to read,
so I couldn't be a scholar.

1930
01:34:27,395 --> 01:34:29,590
Didn't like the coppers.
Think a little harder.

1931
01:34:29,664 --> 01:34:31,859
Put it all together,
and what did I see?

1932
01:34:31,932 --> 01:34:33,058
What?
What could I be?

1933
01:34:33,134 --> 01:34:34,567
I could be an MC.

1934
01:34:34,635 --> 01:34:35,761
I ain't making money trees.

1935
01:34:35,836 --> 01:34:37,064
I'm just planting
my seeds.

1936
01:34:37,138 --> 01:34:38,298
But I'm doing what I feel,

1937
01:34:38,372 --> 01:34:39,532
and that's
a winner to me.

1938
01:34:39,607 --> 01:34:41,040
I eat my Wheaties
for breakfast.

1939
01:34:41,108 --> 01:34:43,201
No one can mess with
the champ.

1940
01:34:43,277 --> 01:34:44,938
I'm a champ.
Oh, yes.

1941
01:34:45,012 --> 01:34:45,979
Today I'm a winner.

1942
01:34:46,047 --> 01:34:47,241
I'll eat you
for dinner.

1943
01:34:47,314 --> 01:34:49,976
I'm a champ.
I'm a champ.

1944
01:34:50,051 --> 01:34:51,211
God gave me talent.

1945
01:34:51,285 --> 01:34:52,513
I'm a super machine.

1946
01:34:52,586 --> 01:34:54,486
I'm better than the dudes
that I see on TV.

1947
01:34:54,555 --> 01:34:55,852
I'm a champ,
Mama said.

1948
01:34:55,923 --> 01:34:57,151
I'm a champ,
Papa said.

1949
01:34:57,224 --> 01:34:58,384
I'm a champ,
you'll see.

1950
01:34:58,459 --> 01:35:00,324
I'm a champ,
goddamn.

1951
01:35:16,844 --> 01:35:18,778
Hi, I'm Gerald Harcourt

1952
01:35:18,846 --> 01:35:22,748
of the Harcourt Institute
of Table Tennis of Canoga Park.

1953
01:35:22,817 --> 01:35:27,311
And, um, we're here to make
learning table tennis a smash.

1954
01:35:30,124 --> 01:35:35,460
We've got four hands
to perfect your forehands.

1955
01:35:35,529 --> 01:35:40,899
And you'll come back
to learn the backhand.

1956
01:35:40,968 --> 01:35:42,060
Table tennis:

1957
01:35:42,136 --> 01:35:47,233
Truly a sport of kings
and queens.

1958
01:35:47,308 --> 01:35:48,866
(Tom)
I lob it.

1959
01:35:48,943 --> 01:35:53,107
(Gerald)
Harcourt Institute
of Table Tennis of Canoga Park.

1960
01:35:53,180 --> 01:35:55,045
You'll all lob it too.

1961
01:36:01,122 --> 01:36:02,851
(Tom)
That's a...
I think that was a good one.

1962
01:36:02,923 --> 01:36:04,584
(Gerald)
I liked it.
That was good.
