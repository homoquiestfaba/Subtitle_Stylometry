Belle, keep your eyes on the road.
I didn't spill, all right?

Okay, seriously, we need
to figure out where we are.

Hello. We're on the road.

6
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,170
Jamie, how would you like
a punch in the face?

7
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:54,110
Can you please take this?
Because I can‘t find it.

8
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:55,620
That's because it's not on there.

9

Give it to me.
It's a small road.

10

It's not going to be on a map like that.

Can I just interject
something here?

14

I think it would be best if we
stopped turning on these side roads,

15

and go back to the game

16

We're just going on this road
to see where it ends up.

Turn around. Let's go.

Okay, how about we vote on it?

22
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,240
Yeah, that's a great idea.
I second that.

23
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:28,370
Or how about we let the person
with the license actually do the driving

24
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:30,040

If we turn back now, there's no way
I'm going to make it home by 11.

any more comments like that.

Wait. Why do we have to be back by 11?

33
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:49,970

would be faster, and it's not,

00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:30,040
Uh, hello.
He followed us from the store.

173
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:33,340
Yes, I know that, but the whole reason
we left was because he didn't see us.

174
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:34,900
We didn't think we were
going to get caught.

175
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:36,340
The people on the porch probably told him.

176
00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:37,970
He was probably watching us
the whole time.

177
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:39,270
He was just waiting for us to leave,

178
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:41,280
and now he's going to come
after us and disembowel us.

179
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:43,820
Hey, that is the last time
I'm gonna hear anything like that.

180
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:45,010
You understand?

181
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:48,580
Nobody in this car
is getting dis-- dis--

182
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:51,890
- ...disem-- whatever you said.
- Motherfuck!

183
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,930
There's the road!

184
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,360
Oh, crap, Belle!
Slow down!

185
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:58,260
Hold on!

186
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:01,000
[tires screeching]

187
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:04,600
God, get off!

188
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:14,510
Those turns, you can't just
accelerate into them like that.

189
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:17,980
You'll roll the van over completely,
and it'll be good-night.

190
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:20,580
You know about the rolling,
how easy it is to ﬂip a van?

191
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:21,680
Yes! Please shut up!

192
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,250
Hey, if you want to know
if he's following you,

193
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,310
make three right tums--

194
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:26,160
God, there are no freakin' turns!

195
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:28,320
Oh, come on!
Clearly he's following us.

196
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,830
- Belle, drive faster!
- Ow! You hit me in the face.

197
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:32,990
Oh, my God.
Oh, crap.

198
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:35,940
You guys, check your phones.
See if anybody has a signal.

199
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:41,440
No. And they promised
these phones work anywhere.

200
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:44,540
Oh, this is such BS because I can't
do anything about it right now.

201
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:46,710
Well, you can start
by shutting the hell up.

202
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:48,510
Belle, don't tell her to shut up.
She's scared right now.

203
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:50,210
God! Just stop talking!

204
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:52,050
Oh, God.
Did you check my phone?

205
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:54,250
Oh, I shouldn't have turned around.

206
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,550
We've got to go back--
We've got to go back to the store.

207
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:57,960
Where are you going to turn around?

208
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:59,020
No! Don‘t!

209
00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:00,790
[both shouting at once]

210
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:02,090
[Stephanie]
Belle, drive faster!

211
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,360
- Are you sure you're flooring it?
- l am!

212
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,500
[Caroline]
All right, we can-- we can
run him off the road.

213
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:09,130
He's got a bigger vehicle.

214
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,970
Belle, slow down.
Seriously, just pull over.

215
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,340
Are you crazy?
What if that guy's trying to kill us?

216
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:16,310
Remember what she said
about "disemberance"?

217
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:17,970
Calm down.
He's not trying to kill us.

218
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,240
All right, it's nothing.
I'm sure it's fine.

219
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,810
Well, I'm having a nervous breakdown.

220
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:25,880
Just pull over, find out
what he wants, Bella.

221
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:27,920
Okay, worst idea ever!

222
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:29,510
Bella, your mom will be
ten times more mad

223
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:31,580
if you total this van
than if you hit someone's--

224
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:33,390
You don't know
what this guy's capable of.

225
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:35,690
- Exactly!
- Then why do you want us pulling over?

226
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,290
- He could have a gun!
- Or a bomb or stabbing weapon!

227
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:40,360
Yeah. Road rage isn't
that uncommon, you know.

228
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,830
We're not on
a freaking lane.

229
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:43,730
Oh, God, does it gives him
the right to rage us on the road?

230
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:48,330
Maybe we could just pay him for the damage,
and maybe that will make him go away.

231
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:49,670
I've got five dollars.

232
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:51,340
- How much y'all think it is?
- I didn't do anything.

233
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:53,880
We need to smash
the other effing headlight.

234
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:56,470
I can't do this.
I can't keep driving.

235
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:57,540
You're going to have to.

236
00:10:57,620 --> 00:10:59,520
No, seriously, I can't.

237
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:00,650
My hands are, like, dripping wet.

238
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,620
- I can't even hold onto the steering wheel.
- All right, all right.

239
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:05,560
Anyone got anything to wipe it off with?
A towel, a napkin, anything?

240
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:06,650
Here, use this.
Oh, yes.

241
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:08,560
Here you go. Here you go.

242
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:13,020
Road!

243
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:14,730
Oh, Shit!

244
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,430
[tires squealing]

245
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:24,210
You think I can't see that?

246
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,370
It's totally burning into my eyes.

247
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:28,010
God, I can barely see.

248
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:31,310
God, please give Isabella
the strength to drive really fast.

249
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:32,680
Please get us back home safely.

250
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:33,850
Somebody keep track
of where we're going

251
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,290
so we don't get so far, like,
in that we can't find our way out.

252
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,620
Why don't you?

253
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:39,990
Whatever problem they have,
just leave us alone.

254
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:46,030
[tires screeching]

255
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:49,400
- What happened to the road?
- Turn around, turn around, turn around!

256
00:11:56,810 --> 00:11:58,540
Oh, no.

257
00:11:58,610 --> 00:11:59,880
Go, please!
l can't!

258
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:01,510
There's nowhere to go.
There's not enough room.

259
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:02,710
It's completely blocked.

260
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:04,680
Bella, just ram him.
Knock him out of the way.

261
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:06,880
Oh, I would so be flooring it right now.

262
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,390
There's nowhere to freakin' go!

263
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:10,290
There's a ditch!

264
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,880
[all screaming]

265
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,950
Right now! Get out!

266
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:16,660
Oh, my God!

267
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:18,160
I will shoot you!

268
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:19,830
Turn it off!
Turn off the van!

269
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:21,160
No, Bella!
[turns off ignition]

270
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,430
Don't do it.

271
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,700
Tell her to stop it! Go!
Get out of the car!

272
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:26,300
Don't let her get out.

273
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:28,270
Don't-- Don't let her in!
Don't let her in!

274
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:29,310
Get out!
[girls screaming]

275
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:31,780
[Woman]
Get out and throw me the key!

276
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:34,470
- [keys landing]
- Pick 'em up and hand them to me!

277
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:35,850
[girls whimpering]

278
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,610
[Woman]
Now walk!

279
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:40,150
All of you! Out! Now!

280
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:41,650
No, no, no.

281
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:46,560
Look. I will spray your brains
all over the inside of this car!

282
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:48,720
l will! Now crawl--
Ah! No, no!

283
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,820
- This side!
- [girls screaming]

284
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:52,490
Let's go. This side only.

285
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:54,190
Crawl over the seat.

286
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,430
Let's go! Get out!

287
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:02,140
Let's go!

288
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:05,040
- [girls crying]
- Oh, God!

289
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:08,170
Get out. Quick.

290
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:10,710
Get out.

291
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,450
[crying]
We're sorry. We're sorry for--

292
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,450
Get your asses on the ground.

293
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:17,490
Hush up! Shut up!

294
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:19,990
Down!
[sniveling]

295
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:21,620
Shut up!

296
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:24,670
How much did you see? Huh?

297
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:26,600
What did you see?

298
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:28,000
We didn't see anything.

299
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:30,230
Stop lying to me, girl!

300
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:32,400
I'll turn the whole van
into a room for a necrophiliac.

301
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:35,270
[pumps shotgun]
[girls sobbing]

302
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:38,370
Don't move. Don't move.
Oh, God!

303
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:41,970
We're all going to stay
as still as possible right now.

304
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:44,420
Not one movement, or boom!

305
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:47,150
I'll do it!
[girls crying]

306
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:48,620
Please, we'll do anything!

307
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:50,660
Just don't kill us!
Anything?

308
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:53,630
You turned a mother's
own daughter against her.

309
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,460
How dare you destroy my family!

310
00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:56,830
[Belle]
We don't know
what you're talking about.

311
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:58,890
Yes, you do!

312
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:01,490
You home-wrecker!

313
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:04,090
Up against the van!
Let's go!

314
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:05,400
Go!

315
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:07,070
To the front!

316
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:08,130
Oh, God.

317
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:12,270
Now take off your clothes.

318
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:14,470
Why?

319
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:16,240
Why?

320
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:21,280
Because I want to see
what's so special about you.

321
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,220
- Now take 'em off!
- Please, no!

322
00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:26,560
I will blow the flesh
off your fucking skull.

323
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:28,090
Understand, you little shit?

324
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,320
Now take 'em off!

325
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:32,630
Please don't make us.
Please, please.

326
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:35,790
- Please don't make us.
- Let's go.

327
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:37,860
[girls crying]

328
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:46,370
You can't do this.

329
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:49,080
- Please.
- Blah, blah, blah.

330
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:50,640
Put them in a pile.

331
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,280
In a pile right there!

332
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:56,080
Please. Please.

333
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:59,150
Please? Please?

334
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,450
Everything.

335
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:03,960
Take everything off.

336
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:06,120
Hurry up! Don't take all night.

337
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,500
[sobbing]
Please.

338
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:10,040
Ha ha.

339
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:14,670
Girls, don't cross your arms.

340
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:17,740
Hands at your sides.

341
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:19,010
Come on.

342
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:21,010
No covering up.

343
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:24,250

[girls quieting down]

347
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:40,960
Be a good little girl and tinkle
on your clothes, okay?

348
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:46,670
I need you to pee pee on your clothes,

349
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:51,510
or I will ram this gun
so far up your ass

350
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:55,070
that it will blow your insides
out of your fuckin' mouth!

351
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:02,550
You brought your filth into my home.

352
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:04,220
Into my bed!

353
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:07,690
[shouting hysterically]

354
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:12,490
Do it! Bam!
- I can't!

355
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:15,630
Bam!
Okay, I'll do it.

356
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,690
No, no, don't do it.

357
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:19,640
All right.
No.

358
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:22,700
Get over here. Let's go!

359
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:24,110
Stop it!
No!

360
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:26,200
Get down!

361
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:29,510
Why?
What?

362
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:31,580
You have to let us go.

363
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:34,210
Do l?

364
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:36,220
Like heck.

365
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:43,100
I don't see anything.

366
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:50,200
Don't-- Don't talk to me,
for me.

367
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:54,030
[trickling]

368
00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:01,340
There you go.

369
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:03,440
Good girl.

370
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:06,040
That wasn't so bad, was it?

371
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:10,490
Now get back over there,
you filthy slut!

372
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:13,920
All right, on your knees.

373
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,230
All of you!

374
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:18,360
Don't look at me.
Don't look at me!

375
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:20,020
- Turn around!
- [girls screaming]

376
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:21,660
Turn around! Don't look at me.

377
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:24,170
Shut up!

378
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:28,400
Next one to make a sound
gets their face ripped off

379
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,440
by a hundred little pellets.

380
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:32,070
Think that's gonna feel good, huh?

381
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:34,740
Do you?
[screaming]

382
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:39,780
Don't make me mad.

383
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,950
[girls crying]

384
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:49,420
What time am I supposed
to pick up the girls?

385
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:52,330
Oh, my God.

386
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,030
I still got to get ready.

387
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:55,800
I'm gonna be late.

388
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:57,340
Oh, God!

389
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:59,700
Oh, God.

390
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,270
[car door closes]

391
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:06,040
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

392
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,490
[sobbing]
Oh, my God.

393
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:24,550
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

394
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:27,620
[all sobbing]

395
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,070
Holy shit. What just happened?

396
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:34,500
Oh, my God.

397
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,740
Bella, it's okay.
[sniveling]

398
00:18:38,810 --> 00:18:40,800
You're safe now.
She's gone.

399
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:50,550
l-- I just want to forget
everything that just happened

400
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:53,090
and go home.

401
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:02,000
Steph. Steph. you all right?

402
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:05,470
Well, l have pee all over my leg.

403
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:09,400
This is so gross.

404
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,900
It's fine. We're gonna get dressed now, okay?

405
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,220
Okay? Okay.

406
00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:26,890
Ugh. Ugh, it's wet.

407
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,160
[Melanie]
I know it is.

408
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:31,290
Ugh.

409
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:35,060
Why-- Why did she do this to us?

410
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:40,130
We-- I-- We don't
even know her family.

411
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:43,300
That woman had something
seriously wrong with her.

412
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:46,350
I mean, you just don't do that to people.

413
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:48,810
You don't make somebody
urinate on their own clothes.

414
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,780
[Jamie]
Can we not relive the situation, okay?

415
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:54,290
I'm never leaving my room again.

416
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,290
I'm just going to tell my parents,

417
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:58,290
"Next time I say I want
to go do something,

418
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:01,090
you say, 'No. Go to your room."'

419
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:04,060
I want to go home
and forget this all happened.

420
00:20:04,130 --> 00:20:05,860
We can't. She took the keys.

421
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:08,770
How the shit are we
supposed to get home, then?

422
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,700
We could hot-wire the van.

423
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:13,470
You don't know
how to hot-wire the van.

424
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:16,880
[whimpering]

425
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:18,970
[Jamie]
What are we going to do?

426
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:23,810
[whimpering]

427
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,110
- Belle.
- Yeah.

428
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:27,950
Talk to me. Are you okay?

429
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:29,890
There-- There's a spare key.

430
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,950
- Where? Where?
- It's in the car well.

431
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:33,860
It's in a small metal box.

432
00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:36,160
[rummaging]

433
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:41,060
[Jamie]
Thank God.

434
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:46,060
Steph. get out, get out.

435
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:49,300
[Stephanie]
I almost had it.

436
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:50,930
[Jamie]
You didn't do anything, seriously.

437
00:20:51,010 --> 00:20:54,450
Let's just get everyone
in the van, let's go.

438
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,950
[Jamie sobbing]

439
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:58,380
[grunting]
God!

440
00:20:58,450 --> 00:21:00,780
Stop. Stop it.

441
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:03,590
[wailing]
Just go.

442
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:04,890
We'll go when she's ready.

443
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,480
She's got all these strange feelings
going on in her head right now.

444
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:09,150
We need to be supportive
and not rush her.

445
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:10,860
Just give her a couple of minutes.

446
00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:13,130
We don't have
a couple of minutes!

447
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,690
[sobbing]
I want to go home!

448
00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:18,470
Of course you do. We all do.

449
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:21,370
But we're not helping
by acting frantic around her.

450
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,040
It's over. We're all okay.

451
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,550
[sobbing continues]

452
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:36,150
Bella, you okay enough to drive?

453
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:37,920
Uh-huh.

454
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,630
Bella, come on. Let's go.

455
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:54,700
I want to get out of here.

456
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:02,080
[engine starts]

457
00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:04,780

[Jamie sobbing]

459
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:09,290
Bella, you sure you're okay?

460
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,450
Where's my-- Where's my seatbelt?

461
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:13,990
You have it on.

462
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:18,890
Okay.

463
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:21,160
[Belle]
Oh. Okay.

464
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:24,030
[shifting gears]

465
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:47,930
[Melanie]
Bella, just floor it.

466
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,160
Come on, we'll fly right past her.

467
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:52,720
[engine accelerating]

468
00:22:54,770 --> 00:22:57,260
[screaming]

469
00:22:58,170 --> 00:23:01,900
For God's sake, Bella,
whatever you do, don't let off the gas.

470
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:04,340
What the hell does she wants?

471
00:23:04,410 --> 00:23:05,810
Still following us.

472
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,210

[honking continues]

477
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:20,690
If we go off the road,
she'll get us again.

478
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,700
Please, go faster, please.

479
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:24,030

00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:25,190

My nose.

485
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,370
She'll run us off the road.

486
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,810
Please, please go faster!

487
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:43,780
[honking fades]

488
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:54,550
[sobbing]
l can't--

489
00:23:54,630 --> 00:23:56,600
l can't get this open.

490
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:58,560
You don't need a Band-aid.

491
00:23:58,630 --> 00:24:00,100
[Melanie]
Tilt your head forward.

492
00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:01,570
[honking gets louden]

493
00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:03,660
Back!

494
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:07,140
No, you're not. Here.

495
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:10,340
Here. Put this in your nose.

496
00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:12,070
How am I suppose to breathe?

497
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:14,810
Breathe through your mouth.
Come on, get it together.

498
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:18,940

God!

501
00:24:27,330 --> 00:24:28,490
Oh, shit!

502
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,290
We got to do something.

503
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:32,390
l can't keep driving like this.

504
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:36,370
See if there's anything behind the seats.

505
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:39,300
We have to start throwing shit at her!

506
00:24:39,370 --> 00:24:42,340
Whoa, Jamie.
Now you're talking crazy.

507
00:24:42,410 --> 00:24:45,540
The speedometer goes up to 120.

508
00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:47,580
Why aren't we going 120?

509
00:24:47,650 --> 00:24:51,680
l can't go in this freaking car
120 miles an hour!

510
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:56,090
So there-- Something's,
like, bad back there!

511
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,950
[Belle]
We're almost out of gas.

512
00:24:58,030 --> 00:24:59,490
[Melanie]
Seriously?

513
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:04,160
Oh, my God.
What is this?

514
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:05,660
[Belle]
Those are my dad's ashes.

515
00:25:05,730 --> 00:25:07,670
This should be
in a cemetery somewhere,

516
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:09,230
not in my hands.

517
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:11,790
They haven't got buried yet.
Put it away!

518
00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:14,740
- Here, take it.
- I don't want it!

519
00:25:14,810 --> 00:25:17,640
We need to throw stuff at her.
Open the back door.

520
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:22,340
Don't throw that.
We might need it.

521
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:26,210
Oh, Caroline. Are you okay?

522
00:25:26,290 --> 00:25:27,720
[Jamie]
Watch the road.

523
00:25:27,790 --> 00:25:29,020
l can't.

524
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:31,890
There's no freakin' button.

525
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,650
l can't open it through this.

526
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:45,560
Caroline, be careful.

527
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,040
Hold on to something and don't let go.

528
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:49,230
l've thrown stuff at cars before.

529
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:53,080
l'll hold on to you.
I won't let go.

530
00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:55,140
- Oh! Did she hit it?
- [honk]

531
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,240
I got it.

532
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,580
- Quick. give me something else.
- Hand her something else.

533
00:25:58,650 --> 00:26:00,050
Here.

534
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,820
[honks]

535
00:26:04,890 --> 00:26:07,020
She's missing.

536
00:26:07,090 --> 00:26:09,720
Stephanie, you do it.
No!

537
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:10,820
You play softball!

538
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:13,560
- Now who's scared shitless?
- Fuck.

539
00:26:13,630 --> 00:26:16,000
[Stephanie]
I am not hanging out a vehicle
moving at a high-rate speed.

540
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:18,800
- Move!
- What if I get thrown out?

541
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:21,400
[Belle]
What do you need me to do?

542
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:23,570
Do you need me to go left?

543
00:26:27,550 --> 00:26:29,570
[clatter]

544
00:26:29,650 --> 00:26:30,980
- Holy shit!
- Get in the car.

545
00:26:31,050 --> 00:26:33,080
Ew! What is that?

546
00:26:33,150 --> 00:26:38,110
Smells like a giant gorilla
took a dump on a burning tire.

547
00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:41,590
Ugh.
Melanie, what the hell are you doing?

548
00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:46,700
Oh, God, she took a crap in here.

549
00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:47,860
What did you throw?

550
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:49,460
Feces Melanie did!

551
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:51,870
What? She shit in, like, the van?

552
00:26:54,910 --> 00:26:56,310
[laughter]

553
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:58,170
For God's sakes, Melanie.

554
00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:02,200
That was the most disgusting thing
I've ever seen in my life.

555
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:03,770
Open the window.
I'm getting sick.

556
00:27:03,850 --> 00:27:05,050
[vent buzzing]

557
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,710
[Jamie]
Damn, that was foul.

558
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:08,050
But it worked, didn‘t it?

559
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:10,590
Why waste it
when you can taste it?

560
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:13,960
Caroline, this is not funny.
I'm getting sick.

561
00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:15,930
Oh, that gross popcorn
I had at the game

562
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,660
is about to come back up.

563
00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:19,630
Oh, God, I had nachos, too.

564
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:22,030
Okay, yeah. Can you, um,
wipe your hands off with something

565
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:23,730
or hang them out the window?

566
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,770
Open my purse.
There's some wipey things in there.

567
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:33,810
My dad sends them with me in case
there's nowhere for me to wash my hands.

568
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:37,540
Why? Do you make it a habit
of snapping off cigars in your hand?

569
00:27:50,430 --> 00:27:52,260
Gross. Are there any more?

570
00:27:52,330 --> 00:27:55,030
No, that's it.

571
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:58,070
Here. It's all we've got.

572
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:05,540
Okay, let's get the map
to find out where we're at.

573
00:28:05,610 --> 00:28:09,050
Yeah, uh, don't start talking
until you're done wiping up over there.

574
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,910
Ugh.

575
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:15,710
[Stephanie vomits]

576
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:18,880
- Would you mind pulling over?
- Oh, God!

577
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,720
I thought that was a sneeze.

578
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:22,020
- Whoa.
- I'm sorry.

579
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:23,820
It just kind of came up.

580
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:25,130
Aah!

581
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,000
[tires screeching]

582
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:29,160
- Damn, Belle!
- Aw!

583
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:31,670
Can't-- Can't you drive over that?

584
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:32,760
[Belle]
Uh, no.

585
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:36,330
We got to move it.
Let's go.

586
00:28:36,410 --> 00:28:38,500
Hurry!

587
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,780
[Caroline]
Stephanie, are you okay?

588
00:28:44,850 --> 00:28:47,620
Yeah. I just--

589
00:28:47,690 --> 00:28:51,020
- l can't stand septic-like odors.
- Oh, baby, it's all over your shirt.

590
00:28:51,090 --> 00:28:53,120
Take it off.

591
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,990
There's like--
Oh, there's popcorn all over this.

592
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:04,230
Oh, don't examine it.
I'll throw up again.

593
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:06,570
Here, put this on.

594
00:29:08,610 --> 00:29:10,270
Come on.

595
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:18,350
- You could just throw that away.
- Are you sure?

596
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:20,940
It has throw-up and pee all over it.

597
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:27,120
- It's not moving.
- Push harder!

598
00:29:27,190 --> 00:29:29,360
Hello, it's not happening.

599
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:31,160
[Caroline]
Hey, guys.

600
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:32,720
- What?
- Come here. There's a clearing.

601
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:35,170
I think we can get through over here.

602
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:40,370
Oh, shit.

603
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:43,070
[Belle]
Everyone, get in!

604
00:29:49,450 --> 00:29:50,850
Come on, Bella, get us home.

605
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,180
I don't know where I'm going.

606
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:53,880
What? What?

607
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:56,950
Nothing. I was just seeing how fast
you're going because she's catching up.

608
00:29:58,790 --> 00:30:00,950
She's got to be going,
like, 100 miles an hour.

609
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:02,020
Do something with this.

610
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:08,130
[all screaming]
[tires screeching]

611
00:30:09,870 --> 00:30:12,860
Oh! Oh, my neck!

612
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:15,640
- Shit!
- Oh, God. I'm still alive.

613
00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:17,540
I thought that was it.

614
00:30:17,610 --> 00:30:18,810
Everybody else okay?

615
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:21,940
[coughing]
Was that my dad?

616
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:23,950
[honks]

617
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:26,920
Move your heads.

618
00:30:26,990 --> 00:30:28,420
[Melanie]
Go faster!

619
00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:29,720
l can't see!

620
00:30:29,790 --> 00:30:31,350
[car honks]
Oh, God.

621
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:33,390
It's freaking on my mouth.
I think I ate some.

622
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:35,860
Oh, God, if something happened,
I think I'm gonna get sick again.

623
00:30:35,930 --> 00:30:36,990
[honking continues]

624
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:38,430
[Jamie]
Keep your eyes back there.
I'll watch her.

625
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:41,660
l freakin' can't see
because of the stupid writing.

626
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:42,600
[Melanie]
Do your best.

627
00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:44,400
Are you crying?

628
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:47,200
Don't start crying.
You are driving now.

629
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:48,640
Shut up!

630
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:50,510
l can't see.

631
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:52,770
Hold on!

632
00:30:56,550 --> 00:30:58,020
Oh, shit.

633
00:30:59,050 --> 00:31:00,640
[car honking]

634
00:31:02,290 --> 00:31:03,550
What was that?
What's wrong with your van?

635
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:05,680
Oh, God.
Please don't leave me now.

636
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:08,960
No, not happening.
Not happening!

637
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:12,990
What do you want from us?

638
00:31:14,530 --> 00:31:17,440
[all screaming]

639
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:21,170
[screaming louder]

640
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:26,480
Go, Belle, go!

641
00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:29,010
Oh, my God!

642
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:30,140
[engine shuts oil]

643
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:32,880
[girls crying]

644
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:36,760
- I think I killed her.
- Self-defense!

645
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:39,350
I just killed someone.

646
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:42,520
Fuck her!
She had it coming.

647
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:46,720
Stupid cum-guzzling whore!

648
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:49,330
My mom's gonna be so mad at me.

649
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:52,700
l just-- I just hit
someone with her van.

650
00:31:52,770 --> 00:31:54,740
l spilled Dad all over the inside.

651
00:31:54,810 --> 00:31:56,970
[crying]
Bella, go back.

652
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:59,010
Run her over again.

653
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:02,280
- What are you doing?
- I'm going to make sure she's...

654
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:05,010
[engine chugging]

655
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:07,610
For God's sakes, give us a break!

656
00:32:07,690 --> 00:32:09,280
No, no, no!

657
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,620
Come on, start!

658
00:32:10,690 --> 00:32:11,710
Forget going back there.

659
00:32:11,790 --> 00:32:13,380
Just get this van started and let's go.

660
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:15,220
It won't. Come on!

661
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:16,590
This isn't working.
Let's go take hers.

662
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:18,030
Are you insane?
[engine chugging]

663
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:20,860
It's easy. We take it and we get
as far away from here as we can

664
00:32:20,930 --> 00:32:22,460
because we're obviously
not getting home in this.

665
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:24,440
What if that woman gets up?

666
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:26,840
We hit her with the freakin' van.
She's not getting up.

667
00:32:26,910 --> 00:32:28,670
Belle!
[engine chugging]

668
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:30,400
Belle, it's dead!
Stop.

669
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,950
Come on.

670
00:32:34,710 --> 00:32:36,710
Let's go. We can do this.

671
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:38,250
[weeping]

672
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:41,720
I just want to get out of here.

673
00:32:43,290 --> 00:32:45,260
- Belle, come on!
- What about my mom's van?

674
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:47,090
Just leave it. It's okay.

675
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:49,860
[shuts off car]
[music stops]

676
00:32:49,930 --> 00:32:52,090
Uh, the light went out!

677
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:53,150
Her headlight just went out!

678
00:32:53,230 --> 00:32:54,220
She's up! Run!

679
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,680
We've got to hide the van,
turn off the lights.

680
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,830
Help me push it into the trees!

681
00:32:58,910 --> 00:33:02,430
Guys, get back here!

682
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:04,140
Come on.

683
00:33:04,210 --> 00:33:05,270
Okay.

684
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:07,680
[all grunting]

685
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:09,650
Belle, steer.

686
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:30,090
We got to find--

687
00:33:30,170 --> 00:33:32,700
We have to find things
to cover the van with.

688
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:42,740
Everybody, get in!

689
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:53,890
She saw us.
She knows where we're at.

690
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:56,550
She's-- She's just right down there.
She had to have seen us.

691
00:34:11,910 --> 00:34:13,170
[exhales]

692
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:15,480
Oh, God.
She didn't see us.

693
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:16,910
Holy shit, Caroline.

694
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:18,640
You almost had us
walk right up to her.

695
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:20,850
Well, if we had not taken, like,
10 minutes to talk about the situation

696
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:24,380
and gone when I said, yes, we would
be on our way home right now.

697
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:28,050
We need to take turns
watching the road in case a car comes,

698
00:34:28,130 --> 00:34:29,390
so we can flag it down.

699
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:30,860
No way. What if it's that woman?

700
00:34:30,930 --> 00:34:32,690
If it has two headlights,
it's not going to be.

701
00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:35,330
There's a pretty good chance
we're stuck here till morning.

702
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:37,430
l-- I need to put my dad back.

703
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:39,200
Where-- Where's the...

704
00:34:41,070 --> 00:34:43,570
[thunder rumbling]

705
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:46,080
Oh, God.

706
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:54,250
This looks like concrete.

707
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,620
I'm serious.

708
00:34:55,690 --> 00:34:57,280
When my grandfather was cremated,

709
00:34:57,360 --> 00:35:00,380
his ashes looked like
dark gray crushed seashells,

710
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:04,060
and this... looks like concrete.

711
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:07,600
Takes like it, too.

712
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:09,400
[Belle]
Shut up!

713
00:35:09,470 --> 00:35:12,270
That's my dad you're talking about.

714
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:14,360
Except, I don't think it is.

715
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:17,900
Yeah, wasn't it that place
in Georgia that was doing that?

716
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:19,210
Where was your dad cremated?

717
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,870
Not there, okay?

718
00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:23,250
I don't want to talk
about this right now.

719
00:35:26,850 --> 00:35:28,820
[crying]

720
00:35:36,530 --> 00:35:38,590
Here.

721
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:41,520
[sniffling]

722
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:45,230
Why does everything
always happen to me?

723
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:53,180
My mom-- My mom's catching--
We get hit by a random woman.

724
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:03,220
My dad's ashes, they aren't even--

725
00:36:03,290 --> 00:36:05,090
they aren't even real.

726
00:36:09,730 --> 00:36:11,890
I made one mistake.

727
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:16,600
I don't think I deserve all this shit.

728
00:36:19,970 --> 00:36:24,770
Mel, I'm sorry I was pulling
away from you.

729
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:30,510
l was doing it just so you
couldn't get in the van.

730
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:35,310
Let's not worry about that right now.

731
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:38,290
No.

732
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:46,730
I'm sorry for playing jokes on you.

733
00:36:48,270 --> 00:36:50,460
I probably did it way too often.

734
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:53,010
And I don't mean to.

735
00:36:53,070 --> 00:36:55,700
I'm sorry for everything
I've done to you lately.

736
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:58,140
Like what?

737
00:36:58,210 --> 00:37:00,440
Like shooting Roman candles at you

738
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:04,350
and lighting them and making you--
and tell you to just run.

739
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,050
[crying]
Oh, yeah.

740
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:11,950
I really got burned.

741
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:15,650
I still have a scar on my leg.
[sniffles]

742
00:37:15,730 --> 00:37:18,530
l'm sorry for--

743
00:37:20,230 --> 00:37:23,260
- Is that all you're sorry about?
- No.

744
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:30,340
I'm sorry that a lot of cruel people

745
00:37:30,410 --> 00:37:33,470
gang up on you.

746
00:37:33,550 --> 00:37:36,410
I'm sorry I go along with it.

747
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:42,220
I'm also sorry

748
00:37:42,290 --> 00:37:44,720
that I tell you l have
to do homework...

749
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:49,960
and then I go out with Jamie instead.

750
00:37:51,830 --> 00:37:54,820
And I'm sorry I don't invite you to come.

751
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:00,970
I'm really sorry we don't
hang out like we used to.

752
00:38:03,910 --> 00:38:05,610
I really miss it.

753
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:08,550
I haven't gone anywhere.

754
00:38:11,890 --> 00:38:13,480
I know.

755
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:24,160
Yeah. I guess you don't always
deserve everything I do to you.

756
00:38:24,230 --> 00:38:28,330
You guess? So you don't know?

757
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,200

Um...
[clears throat]

760
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:56,090
Maybe we could get to the top
of one of these hills

761
00:38:56,160 --> 00:39:00,430
and then maybe we could get
a signal on one of our cell phones.

762
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:02,560
That's a great idea right there.

763
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:06,160
You want to go walking
through the woods in pitch dark?

764
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,500
We have a flashlight, don't we?

765
00:39:07,570 --> 00:39:11,030
Hey, guys, maybe we could get
to the top of one of these hills

766

and then we could get a signal
on one of our cell phones.

00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:33,750
Belle, why aren't you driving faster?

877
00:51:33,820 --> 00:51:35,290
We're gonna get her.
Caroline--

878
00:51:35,350 --> 00:51:36,480
I'm serious.

879
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:37,750
You have to keep your feet up.

880
00:51:37,820 --> 00:51:40,450
You're cut.
Let me help you, okay?

881
00:51:42,830 --> 00:51:45,320
Oh...

882
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:46,690
Caroline, were you raped?

883
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:48,430
[Belle]
How is that possible?

884
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:51,990
[crying]
Let's not relive the situation.

885
00:51:53,570 --> 00:51:55,540
Oh, my God.

886
00:51:59,110 --> 00:52:01,240
What is that?

887
00:52:07,490 --> 00:52:10,920
She stuffed this.

888
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:14,360
[drops screwdriver]

889
00:52:14,430 --> 00:52:18,620
Caroline, I'm so sorry.

890
00:52:22,670 --> 00:52:24,730
There she is!

891
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:27,430
Stephanie! We're coming!

892
00:52:27,510 --> 00:52:28,600
Belle, why aren't you going?

893
00:52:28,670 --> 00:52:30,040
Caroline, sit back!

894
00:52:30,110 --> 00:52:31,370
[Caroline crying]

895
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:33,430
Go! Stephanie, we're coming!

896
00:52:33,510 --> 00:52:35,780
Why aren't you going?
Come on!

897
00:52:35,850 --> 00:52:38,150
Go! Please.

898
00:52:39,620 --> 00:52:40,610
[Melanie]
Do something!

899
00:52:40,690 --> 00:52:43,310
- What do you want me to do?
- Go, Bella, go!

900
00:52:43,390 --> 00:52:46,520
[all yelling]

901
00:52:47,990 --> 00:52:49,150
No, Bella!
Where are we going?

902
00:52:49,230 --> 00:52:50,790
Stephanie! We have to go!

903
00:52:50,860 --> 00:52:53,160
Hang on!
She's going to kill her!

904
00:52:53,230 --> 00:52:55,390
- [smack]
- What's wrong with you?

905
00:52:55,470 --> 00:52:58,830
Stop it! You're scaring us!

906
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:07,010
Bella, come on.
Find her.

907
00:53:15,090 --> 00:53:18,020
[mouthing words]

908
00:53:33,770 --> 00:53:36,170
- Right or left?
- Right!

909
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:37,730
- Should I go right?
- Yeah!

910
00:53:45,220 --> 00:53:47,190
[Belle]
Uh, may-- maybe
we should've gone left.

911
00:53:47,250 --> 00:53:50,550
Maybe we should stop listening
to every little idea Melanie has.

912
00:53:50,620 --> 00:53:52,680
I know y'all felt sorry
for her and everything...

913
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:53,750
What's that supposed to mean?

914
00:53:53,830 --> 00:53:55,920
It means maybe you should find
someone else to tag along with.

915
00:53:55,990 --> 00:53:57,090
Jamie, burn in hell.

916
00:53:57,160 --> 00:53:58,460
She can't make
decisions on her own

917
00:53:58,530 --> 00:54:00,090
because she's too worried
about what you might--

918
00:54:00,170 --> 00:54:02,630
Guys, stop!

919
00:54:02,700 --> 00:54:04,900

Right there!

920
00:54:04,970 --> 00:54:07,460
[stops engine]

921
00:54:07,540 --> 00:54:08,840
Why is she sitting there?

922
00:54:08,910 --> 00:54:10,670
You think she's waiting on us again?

923
00:54:13,450 --> 00:54:16,040
[Belle]
There's no one in there.

924
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:20,410
[Caroline]
Come on, I'm not going alone.

925
00:54:20,490 --> 00:54:22,750
Hold up. Let's make sure
we're not walking into a trap.

926
00:54:27,090 --> 00:54:29,890
Caroline!

927
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:31,620
Caroline, get back in here!

928
00:54:31,700 --> 00:54:33,930
I don't think you should be walking.

929
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,190
Caroline.

930
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,870
[sobbing]

931
00:54:41,940 --> 00:54:43,870
Is one of us dead?

932
00:54:43,940 --> 00:54:47,070
[crying]
No. No.

933
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:55,180
Oh, my God.

934
00:54:55,250 --> 00:54:57,150
[Jamie]
Well, check!

935
00:55:04,630 --> 00:55:06,600
[Melanie]
Those are really dead people.

936
00:55:06,670 --> 00:55:08,830
[Caroline]
Where's Stephanie? Where--

937
00:55:08,900 --> 00:55:10,130
We have to find her.

938
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:13,100
[Jamie]
Why did you have to open
the back of her car?

939
00:55:13,170 --> 00:55:15,330
[Belle]
Those are the last people
that broke her headlight off.

940
00:55:15,410 --> 00:55:16,970
That's what she's going to do to us!

941
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:18,100
We got to get out of here!

942
00:55:18,180 --> 00:55:20,040
We have to find Stephanie.

943
00:55:20,110 --> 00:55:22,840
We're not going to find her
marching off into the woods.

944
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:25,850
And definitely not with some
strange woman out there.

945
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:28,750
For all I know, she could be
walking to us right now.

946
00:55:28,820 --> 00:55:30,480
We're leaving!
[groans]

947
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:33,490
This is, like, the third time
I've thrown up.

948
00:55:34,730 --> 00:55:36,630
Ew! It's a whole family.

949
00:55:36,700 --> 00:55:38,250
I think one of them is a little boy.

950
00:55:38,330 --> 00:55:40,660
What the hell?
Stop poking at 'em. Damn!

951
00:55:40,730 --> 00:55:43,700
We need to find that ugly crack whore

952
00:55:43,770 --> 00:55:46,290
and smash her flicking face in

953
00:55:46,370 --> 00:55:48,270
until there's nothing but blood

954
00:55:48,340 --> 00:55:50,210
and broken teeth and bone fragments!

955
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:53,300
Do you know what she did to me?

956
00:55:53,380 --> 00:55:55,850
Do you know what she's
gonna do to Stephanie?

957
00:55:55,910 --> 00:55:58,680
Do you know what she's gonna
do to us if we don't get out of here?

958
00:55:58,750 --> 00:56:00,010
- No, thank you.
- Stephanie!

959
00:56:00,090 --> 00:56:01,020
I value my life!

960
00:56:01,090 --> 00:56:03,450
We can pop her tires.

961
00:56:09,260 --> 00:56:12,030
[crying]
Stephanie.

962
00:56:12,100 --> 00:56:14,690
Let's just let out the air.

963
00:56:14,770 --> 00:56:17,960
Bella, come and help.

964
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:19,830
Okay.

965
00:56:19,910 --> 00:56:21,530
What do I do?
What do I do?

966
00:56:21,610 --> 00:56:23,170
Press on the nozzle.

967
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:25,230
[air hissing]

968
00:56:28,010 --> 00:56:29,780
It's not doing anything.

969
00:56:29,850 --> 00:56:31,110
[gunshot]
That's it!

970
00:56:31,180 --> 00:56:32,550
We're getting outta here right now.

971
00:56:32,620 --> 00:56:34,810
Get in the van!

972
00:56:34,890 --> 00:56:36,750
- Get Caroline!
- What about Stephanie?

973
00:56:36,820 --> 00:56:38,290
Think about it.
She broke out the window.

974
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:39,920
She ran.
She's nowhere near here.

975
00:56:39,990 --> 00:56:41,860
We don't know that.

976
00:56:41,930 --> 00:56:44,160
Well, pretend!

977
00:56:47,570 --> 00:56:49,300
Come on, Caroline.
Come on.

978
00:56:49,370 --> 00:56:50,960
No, I'm not going.

979
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:53,100
No, I'm not leaving her!

980
00:56:53,170 --> 00:56:55,230
Why won't you help me find her?

981
00:56:55,310 --> 00:56:56,600
No, I'm not going.

982
00:56:56,680 --> 00:56:58,670
Please don't make me go.
I don't want to.

983
00:56:58,740 --> 00:57:01,080
[Jamie]
Go, go, get in.

984
00:57:01,150 --> 00:57:02,670
[Caroline]
No. No, please.

985
00:57:02,750 --> 00:57:04,310
Don't make me go.

986
00:57:04,380 --> 00:57:05,580
No. Steph.

987
00:57:07,750 --> 00:57:10,750
[coughing]

988
00:57:24,470 --> 00:57:25,830
You see anything?

989
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:27,840
Give me the flashlight.

990
00:57:31,880 --> 00:57:33,400
Steph!

991
00:57:33,480 --> 00:57:35,640
Steph!

992
00:57:35,710 --> 00:57:38,550
Steph. come on!

993
00:57:40,390 --> 00:57:42,750
Stephanie!

994
00:57:42,820 --> 00:57:44,250
Steph!

995
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:47,780
[coughing]

996
00:57:47,860 --> 00:57:49,660
This flashlight sucks.
I can't see anything.

997
00:57:49,730 --> 00:57:52,700
This isn't working.

998
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:55,430
We need to be out there
searching in the woods.

999
00:57:55,500 --> 00:57:58,200
I bet she was out here
to bury those bodies,

1000
00:57:58,270 --> 00:58:00,240
and then we got--
and then we hit her and now--

1001
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:03,640
We're not gonna talk
about it, okay? Got it?

1002
00:58:08,780 --> 00:58:10,610
I don't think she came this way.

1003
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:13,450
Turn around, go back the other way.

1004
00:58:26,870 --> 00:58:28,990
This is so screwed up.

1005
00:58:29,070 --> 00:58:30,900
l was just talking
to Stephanie last night.

1006
00:58:30,970 --> 00:58:32,490
You were just talking to her,
like, 10 minutes ago.

1007
00:58:32,570 --> 00:58:34,440
No, she called me last night.

1008
00:58:34,510 --> 00:58:36,060
[Belle]
What for?

1009
00:58:36,140 --> 00:58:38,940
Steve Klusky
asked her on a date.

1010
00:58:39,010 --> 00:58:40,950
What? I never heard
anything about this.

1011
00:58:41,010 --> 00:58:42,950
She didn't tell anyone, okay?

1012
00:58:43,020 --> 00:58:45,540
You don't always
have to know everything.

1013
00:58:47,350 --> 00:58:49,750
She was just calling
to ask me questions

1014
00:58:49,820 --> 00:58:51,910
and wanting to know stuff.

1015
00:58:51,990 --> 00:58:54,460
Dumb stuff.

1016
00:58:54,530 --> 00:58:55,960
[sniffles]

1017
00:58:58,060 --> 00:59:03,760
Like if the shoes she was wearing
made her taller than him.

1018
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:06,170
She was freaking out.

1019
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:10,730
I just want to find Steph
and I just want to see my mom.

1020
00:59:34,770 --> 00:59:37,030
The taste of blood...

1021
00:59:37,100 --> 00:59:38,970
[swallows, crunches]

1022
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:40,300
and broken teeth...

1023
00:59:40,370 --> 00:59:43,000
[crunching]

1024
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:45,410
isn‘t that bad...

1025
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:46,910
[strained breath]

1026
00:59:46,980 --> 00:59:50,510
compared to what she tastes like.

1027
00:59:50,580 --> 00:59:53,070
[spits]

1028
00:59:57,790 --> 01:00:02,780
[all screaming]

1029
01:00:08,130 --> 01:00:10,930
No! No! No!

1030
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:12,030
Jamie!

1031
01:00:12,100 --> 01:00:15,370
[all shouting at once]

1032
01:00:25,020 --> 01:00:26,140
[crash]

1033
01:00:26,220 --> 01:00:28,190
Oh, shit!

1034
01:00:28,250 --> 01:00:30,380
It's in my eyes!

1035
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:33,190
l can't see.
Get out!

1036
01:00:33,260 --> 01:00:34,350
[Melanie]
You guys okay?

1037
01:00:34,430 --> 01:00:35,860
It's burning!

1038
01:00:35,930 --> 01:00:37,490
Belle.

1039
01:00:39,730 --> 01:00:41,760
It's burning!
[whimpering]

1040
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:46,000
Caroline.
Caroline, get up.

1041
01:00:46,070 --> 01:00:47,440
It's time to get up now.

1042
01:00:47,510 --> 01:00:48,970
Caroline-- Here.

1043
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:52,410
- Belle, let me. It's okay.
- Ahh!

1044
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:54,210
- [Jamie yelps]
- Caroline.

1045
01:00:54,280 --> 01:00:56,770
Caroline, get up!

1046
01:00:56,850 --> 01:00:59,510
Oh, God, she's going into shock!

1047
01:01:02,520 --> 01:01:04,490
Caroline.

1048
01:01:11,130 --> 01:01:13,190
Oh, God.

1049
01:01:22,310 --> 01:01:24,170
[gunshot]

1050
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:26,680
- Help me!
- Jamie?

1051
01:01:26,750 --> 01:01:28,840
[wailing]

1052
01:01:28,910 --> 01:01:30,350
Where's Jamie?

1053
01:01:30,420 --> 01:01:31,910
Jamie!

1054
01:01:31,980 --> 01:01:33,210
[Jamie crying]

1055
01:01:33,290 --> 01:01:34,410
No, please stop!

1056
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:40,420
[Belle]
Oh, God, help her!

1057
01:01:40,490 --> 01:01:42,360
[Jamie wailing]
Help!

1058
01:01:45,100 --> 01:01:48,260
[woman shouting indistinctly]

1059
01:01:48,330 --> 01:01:50,230
My baby!

1060
01:01:51,370 --> 01:01:53,360
You bitch!

1061
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:55,240
You hurt my baby!

1062
01:02:02,210 --> 01:02:03,700
[Belle]
Come on!

1063
01:02:03,780 --> 01:02:06,770
Get in the van!
Come on!

1064
01:02:13,590 --> 01:02:16,250
[Jamie crying]
The lady shot me.

1065
01:02:16,330 --> 01:02:19,490
Help me. I don't want to die.

1066
01:02:21,170 --> 01:02:23,530
She shot me.

1067
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:25,300
I don't want to die.

1068
01:02:25,370 --> 01:02:28,970
[Belle]
Jamie, we're going
to get you some help.

1069
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:30,700
You're going to be okay!

1070
01:02:30,780 --> 01:02:31,870
[Melanie]
Jamie, Jamie.

1071
01:02:31,940 --> 01:02:34,140
I need you to push back here, okay?

1072
01:02:34,210 --> 01:02:36,010
Jamie, come on.

1073
01:02:38,940 --> 01:02:40,120
I can't see any light.

1074
01:02:40,390 --> 01:02:42,080
Turn on the inside lights.

1075
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:48,830
- l can't see with these on.
- Well, I need lights.

1076
01:02:48,890 --> 01:02:50,920
Where's the flashlight?
Give me the flashlight.

1077
01:02:53,370 --> 01:02:55,990
- Here!
- I need to tell you something.

1078
01:02:57,300 --> 01:03:02,330
I won't bother you anymore
if you help me.

1079
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:06,500
Caroline, get back here and hold this.

1080
01:03:06,580 --> 01:03:09,010
- I don't want to die.
- Here.

1081
01:03:09,080 --> 01:03:11,780
I don't want to die.

1082
01:03:16,690 --> 01:03:18,050
I don't want to die.

1083
01:03:18,120 --> 01:03:20,280
Jamie, I need you to stay still
and put your feet up.

1084
01:03:20,360 --> 01:03:22,260
[Caroline]
Are we still looking for Stephanie?

1085
01:03:22,330 --> 01:03:23,990
Caroline, Jamie needs our help.

1086
01:03:24,060 --> 01:03:25,620
We need to worry about her
right now, not Stephanie.

1087
01:03:25,700 --> 01:03:27,390
[Jamie]
Oh, God, this is the end, I know it.

1088
01:03:27,470 --> 01:03:28,560
All right. First, you have
to stop the bleeding.

1089
01:03:28,660 --> 01:03:30,240
You have to put pressure on it.

1090
01:03:31,240 --> 01:03:32,230
Right.
Mel, don't let me die.

1091
01:03:32,300 --> 01:03:34,430
Ja-- Jamie!
We have to stop the bleeding!

1092
01:03:34,510 --> 01:03:35,630
[screams]

1093
01:03:35,710 --> 01:03:36,770
I need bandages.

1094
01:03:36,840 --> 01:03:38,740
- Caroline!
- What?

1095
01:03:38,810 --> 01:03:41,180
- Bandages!
- [Jamie stops crying]

1096
01:03:41,250 --> 01:03:42,710
Jamie! Jamie, talk to me!

1097
01:03:42,780 --> 01:03:44,180
Jamie, Jamie, Jamie.

1098
01:03:44,250 --> 01:03:45,340
Talk to me.

1099
01:03:45,420 --> 01:03:46,750
Come on, talk to me.

1100
01:03:46,820 --> 01:03:49,010
Jesus. Melanie, there are
no more fucking bandages.

1101
01:03:49,090 --> 01:03:51,080
Caroline, come here.
Keep her talking.

1102
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:52,380
Got to keep her awake.

1103
01:03:52,460 --> 01:03:55,150
[Caroline]
Jamie. Jamie.

1104
01:03:55,230 --> 01:03:57,390
Jamie, wake up, okay?

1105
01:03:57,460 --> 01:03:58,490
Jamie, baby, wake up.

1106
01:03:58,560 --> 01:03:59,890
Talk to me, okay?

1107
01:03:59,960 --> 01:04:02,330
Tell me about that time
you fell off the parade ﬂoat.

1108
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:04,100
- What?
- Jesus Christ, Melanie.

1109
01:04:04,170 --> 01:04:05,640
I don't know what to fucking say.

1110
01:04:05,700 --> 01:04:08,230
- You talk to her, then.
- Oh, my God, what happened?

1111
01:04:08,310 --> 01:04:11,430
Why am I bleeding?
Why am I bleeding?

1112
01:04:11,510 --> 01:04:12,700
What's all this blood?

1113
01:04:12,780 --> 01:04:14,770
[crying]
I don't wanna die.

1114
01:04:14,850 --> 01:04:15,840
[Melanie]
You're not gonna die.

1115
01:04:15,910 --> 01:04:17,710
- I'm gonna fix you all up.
- I don't wanna die.

1116
01:04:17,780 --> 01:04:19,770
We have to cauterize,
or whatever that word is.

1117
01:04:19,850 --> 01:04:21,480
- We have to burn the wound.
- Are you sure?

1118
01:04:21,550 --> 01:04:23,080
[Caroline]
Jamie, just stay right there, okay?

1119
01:04:23,150 --> 01:04:24,990
Don't move.
You have to stay there.

1120
01:04:25,060 --> 01:04:26,680
And I promise-- I promise you,

1121
01:04:26,760 --> 01:04:29,690
we're gonna get that crack whore
for doing this, okay?

1122
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:31,520
[POPS]

1123
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:34,490
Look out.

1124
01:04:38,140 --> 01:04:39,130
What are you doing?

1125
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:40,360
- This might hurt.
- Please don't.

1126
01:04:40,440 --> 01:04:42,370
Please don't.
Please don't.

1127
01:04:42,440 --> 01:04:44,810
- Here, bite down on this.
- No. No. No.

1128
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:47,400
[crying]
Close.

1129
01:04:48,780 --> 01:04:51,810
[screaming]

1130
01:04:53,080 --> 01:04:55,480
Let's not do that anymore.

1131
01:04:57,490 --> 01:04:59,650
Give me the bandana.

1132
01:05:02,230 --> 01:05:03,320
She needs a doctor.

1133
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:05,490
Well, if you see one, let me know.

1134
01:05:06,630 --> 01:05:09,000
[yelping]

1135
01:05:17,180 --> 01:05:18,370
[screaming]

1136
01:05:18,440 --> 01:05:19,910
[tires screeching]

1137
01:05:19,980 --> 01:05:22,310
Stephanie!

1138
01:05:22,380 --> 01:05:25,040
Stephanie, it's okay.
It's me. It's Caroline.

1139
01:05:25,120 --> 01:05:27,280
[all shouting at once]

1140
01:05:27,350 --> 01:05:29,320
We have to go.
We have to go.

1141
01:05:29,390 --> 01:05:31,720
We're gonna go away.
You have to get in the van.

1142
01:05:31,790 --> 01:05:34,920
You have to go in the van.
Help me! Help me!

1143
01:05:34,990 --> 01:05:37,930
I don't wanna--
I don't wanna go!

1144
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,990
[all shouting at once]

1145
01:05:42,170 --> 01:05:43,570
We're gonna go home.

1146
01:05:43,640 --> 01:05:45,570
- I don't want to go.
- Keep her quiet.

1147
01:05:45,640 --> 01:05:47,370
No, no, no, no.

1148
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:49,960
[Caroline]
What's wrong with her?

1149
01:05:51,210 --> 01:05:53,370
Why does she keep saying that?

1150
01:05:53,450 --> 01:05:55,170
I think she's going into shock.

1151
01:05:55,250 --> 01:05:56,410
[Jamie]
What does that mean?

1152
01:05:56,480 --> 01:05:58,570
It means she's repeating stuff.

1153
01:06:02,150 --> 01:06:04,180
- Oh, God.
- What? What's wrong with her?

1154
01:06:04,260 --> 01:06:05,980
Don't-- Don't-- Don't look

1155
01:06:06,060 --> 01:06:07,850
You'll go to hell if you look
Don't look!

1156
01:06:07,930 --> 01:06:09,920
You'll go to hell if you look
Don't look.

1157
01:06:09,990 --> 01:06:12,360
- Don't look Don't look
- [crying]

1158
01:06:14,070 --> 01:06:16,030
Belle! Find that bitch!

1159
01:06:16,100 --> 01:06:17,360
What happened?

1160
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:19,730
Stephanie, I promise you.

1161
01:06:19,800 --> 01:06:23,100
I'm going to let you hear
the sweet sound of her face cracking

1162
01:06:23,170 --> 01:06:26,540
when l smash it with a fucking brick!

1163
01:06:26,610 --> 01:06:27,870
[panting]

1164
01:06:27,950 --> 01:06:30,380
I feel-- I feel cold.

1165
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:33,080
Is there something
we can stick on Jamie?

1166
01:06:33,150 --> 01:06:35,780
Take my jacket.

1167
01:06:48,030 --> 01:06:50,400
Bella, turn the heat on full blast.

1168
01:06:50,470 --> 01:06:51,990
Don't make me go to hell.

1169
01:06:52,070 --> 01:06:53,870
I don't want to. Please?

1170
01:06:53,940 --> 01:06:56,100
Stephanie, stop saying that.
You're not going to hell.

1171
01:06:56,170 --> 01:06:58,300
How do we fix her?

1172
01:06:58,380 --> 01:07:00,310
Oh, no.

1173
01:07:00,380 --> 01:07:01,850
She ripped your pants.

1174
01:07:01,910 --> 01:07:03,900
- Melanie, what do we do?
- I don't know!

1175
01:07:03,980 --> 01:07:05,540
Damn, we have to bandage her up.

1176
01:07:05,620 --> 01:07:06,610
She's bleeding!

1177
01:07:06,680 --> 01:07:08,120
We don't have anything.

1178
01:07:08,190 --> 01:07:10,980
Here, help me get this off.
Use my shirt.

1179
01:07:13,290 --> 01:07:16,560
Stephanie, it's okay, okay?
We're going to get you better.

1180
01:07:20,300 --> 01:07:23,230
- Is she going to be okay?
- Sure.

1181
01:07:23,300 --> 01:07:24,730
Are you just saying that?

1182
01:07:26,440 --> 01:07:28,230
I think she's gonna need
a little more medical help

1183
01:07:28,310 --> 01:07:29,300
than this shirt can provide.

1184
01:07:29,370 --> 01:07:30,810
It's fine.
Stop touching it.

1185
01:07:35,750 --> 01:07:40,550
God, I've never seen
this much blood before.

1186
01:07:40,620 --> 01:07:45,450
Except for this one time when a girl
fell off the jungle gym and said I helped her.

1187
01:07:45,520 --> 01:07:47,080
Well, it was actually this one girl.

1188
01:07:47,160 --> 01:07:48,220
She would not stop bothering me.

1189
01:07:48,290 --> 01:07:50,690
So I climbed up on top
of the monkey bars and I pushed her.

1190
01:07:50,760 --> 01:07:55,260
She fell, and I got to watch
the blood seep through her skull.

1191
01:07:55,330 --> 01:07:56,930
But really...

1192
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,530
I saw her sitting
underneath the monkey bars,

1193
01:07:59,600 --> 01:08:03,870
and I went up with a chunk of concrete
and smashed her head in!

1194
01:08:03,940 --> 01:08:07,040
I got the teacher,
and I told her she fell.

1195
01:08:07,110 --> 01:08:09,440
I think she went blind in one eye.

1196
01:08:10,980 --> 01:08:12,710
She didn't bother me after that.

1197
01:08:12,780 --> 01:08:14,980
Ever. Or anyone else.

1198
01:08:16,450 --> 01:08:18,920
Okay, that really concerns me.

1199
01:08:24,360 --> 01:08:25,620
No, no, Caroline.

1200
01:08:25,700 --> 01:08:27,130
Stay with me.

1201
01:08:27,200 --> 01:08:30,630
Bella, the next time I see that bitch,
l'm smashing her fucking face in!

1202
01:08:30,700 --> 01:08:33,330
Wrong! We're not
gonna see her again.

1203
01:08:36,610 --> 01:08:40,040
This thing is gonna smash
right through her fucking skull!

1204
01:08:40,110 --> 01:08:42,170
And you know what I'm gonna do
the next time I see her?

1205
01:08:42,250 --> 01:08:43,540
I'm gonna beat her with it.

1206
01:08:43,620 --> 01:08:46,740
I'm gonna beat her with it
until her cranium cracks

1207
01:08:46,820 --> 01:08:48,250
and I'm gonna watch the brains

1208
01:08:48,320 --> 01:08:52,190
seep out from her fucking eye sockets!

1209
01:08:53,790 --> 01:08:56,950
Steph, I'm sorry for everything
that's happened.

1210
01:08:57,030 --> 01:08:59,860
I couldn't move, I froze.

1211
01:08:59,930 --> 01:09:01,800
[crying]

1212
01:09:01,870 --> 01:09:04,890
I said to take the shortcut,

1213
01:09:04,970 --> 01:09:07,800
and I told Belle to leave the wreck.

1214
01:09:07,870 --> 01:09:11,830
Everything happened because of me.

1215
01:09:11,910 --> 01:09:14,280
- That's not true.
- It is.

1216
01:09:14,350 --> 01:09:17,680
l can never make it up to you.

1217
01:09:17,750 --> 01:09:21,120
l can never give back what was taken.

1218
01:09:22,890 --> 01:09:26,820
Clay, we'll just keep taking this road
and surely it'll end up somewhere

1219
01:09:26,890 --> 01:09:29,720
like a town or someplace with people.

1220
01:09:29,790 --> 01:09:31,320
And phones!

1221
01:09:31,400 --> 01:09:33,590
We'll get help.

1222
01:09:33,670 --> 01:09:36,500
Somehow we're gonna get out of this.

1223
01:09:38,700 --> 01:09:40,470
Oh, God! Oh, God!
We got to go!

1224

- We got to go!
- It wasn't her.

1227
01:09:45,780 --> 01:09:47,440
- What wasn't her? What do you see?
- Drive it!

1228
01:09:47,510 --> 01:09:49,140
Is she back there?
I can't see anything!

You have to quit
fighting us, okay? Stop.

Listen to me. It wasn't her.

1233
01:09:56,290 --> 01:09:57,310
It was a streetlight.

1234
01:09:57,390 --> 01:09:58,620
You seriously saw a streetlight?

1235
01:09:58,690 --> 01:10:00,950
No, it was her!
She's coming!

No, no! She's coming!

1239
01:10:06,060 --> 01:10:07,590
Wait. We let all the air
out of her tires.

1240

She can't get us.

1241

No, we didn't.
We barely let any out.

1242

- What are you doing?
- Turning around.

1248
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:25,750
Streetlight's the closest thing
to civilization that we've seen.

1249

1258

Stop the van.
If you don't, you'll ruin the tire.

And if she gets you, she'll kill you.

1267

And if she kills you,
you're dead.

1268

They need me! They--

1395
01:22:35,410 --> 01:22:40,250
Aah!
[gasping, moaning]

1396
01:22:40,320 --> 01:22:42,810
Please. [gasping]

1397
01:22:42,890 --> 01:22:44,580
It's my anniversary.

1398
01:22:44,660 --> 01:22:46,820
Please, let me go home to my husband.

There is a family in the back.

She gunned them all down.

1420
01:27:38,720 --> 01:27:41,450
Well, I guess that's it.

01:28:14,220 --> 01:28:17,120
[Isabella]
Seatbelts.

1422
01:28:55,830 --> 01:29:00,060
Oh, is that the same store?

1423
01:29:00,130 --> 01:29:04,500
- No way. - Did we just go
in a big-ass circle?

1424
01:29:34,230 --> 01:29:37,170
- [gasping]
- What's wrong?

1425
01:29:37,230 --> 01:29:41,190
They're dead.
She killed everyone.

1426
01:29:41,270 --> 01:29:45,670
[gasping]
The clerk. The old man at the counter.

1427
01:29:45,740 --> 01:29:48,140
They're all dead.
There's blood everywhere.

1428
01:29:50,650 --> 01:29:54,080
What about a phone?
Is there a phone?

1429
01:29:54,150 --> 01:29:57,850
God. She shot every fucking thing!
[gasping, crying]

1430
01:29:57,920 --> 01:30:00,550
Let's go.
Let's keep going.

1431
01:30:00,620 --> 01:30:02,390
Going where?

1432
01:30:05,300 --> 01:30:08,590
I want to go home. I don't feel good.

1433
01:30:08,670 --> 01:30:12,030
Okay. We're just gonna
keep going that way.

1434
01:30:12,100 --> 01:30:15,700
At least we know where we are now.

1435
01:30:15,770 --> 01:30:19,260
Yeah, lost still!

1436
01:30:42,430 --> 01:30:47,300
Hey. Don't mess up
my mom's van.
