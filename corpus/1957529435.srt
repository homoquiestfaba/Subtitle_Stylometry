[indistinct chatter]

5
00:02:49,044 --> 00:02:49,961
Your keys, sir.

6
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:51,755
Have a good evening.

7
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:54,841
[indistinct chatter]

8
00:03:09,064 --> 00:03:10,065
All clear, sir.

9
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:13,318
Thank you, Number One.

10
00:03:41,262 --> 00:03:44,682
[scoffs] Well, well, what have we here?

11
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:51,981
Keep her close.

12
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:54,484
I won't be staying long.

13
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:57,654
<i>Si, senorita.</i>

14
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:05,245
It's a very good
Catwoman costume, my dear,

15
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:06,955
if a trifle dated.

16
00:04:07,038 --> 00:04:08,373
What can I say?

17
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:10,959
I have an appreciation for the classics.

18
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:13,128
As do I, my dear.

19
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:15,463
As do I.

20
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:20,927
It's invitation only, sir.

21
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:22,595
[snaps fingers]

22
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:26,933
[Black Mask] I believe that covers
my entire entourage.

23
00:04:27,183 --> 00:04:29,394
Yes, sir. Please enjoy
the masquerade, sir.

24
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:36,401
[laughter and indistinct chatter]

25
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:57,088

[all gasping]

27
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:02,927
[Black Mask] Stand down, gentlemen.

28
00:05:03,344 --> 00:05:06,222
Tobias Whale here works for our hostess.

29
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:08,099
Excuse me.

30
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:09,976
I must pay my respects.

31
00:05:10,226 --> 00:05:11,269
Find me later.

32
00:05:11,603 --> 00:05:13,521
Oh, count on it.

33
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:28,912
Allow me to introduce you
to the leader of Leviathan,

34
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:31,289
Lady Barbara Minerva.

35
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:35,335
Lady Barbara, this is Roman Sionis,

36
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:38,588
known in Gotham City as Black Mask.

37
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:44,052
It's an honor to finally meet
the big boss in person.

38
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:47,555
[scoffs] I don't see myself
as any kind of boss.

39
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:51,768
Leviathan is more
of a cooperative organization.

40
00:05:52,268 --> 00:05:53,228
We help each other.

41
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:55,772
That's exactly what impressed me,

42
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:57,982
and I am not easily impressed.

43
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:59,859
[Minerva] Neither am I, I'm afraid.

44
00:06:00,568 --> 00:06:02,320
I trust you have your entrance fee.

45
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:05,281
Right here.

46
00:06:06,824 --> 00:06:10,119
I assume you can secure it
until we're ready to depart.

47
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:11,829
I can.

48
00:06:12,747 --> 00:06:14,457
[saxophone music playing]

49
00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:19,170

[gasps]

51
00:06:30,431 --> 00:06:33,017
Darling, I love your costume.

52
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:35,103
Oof, hold on to that one, love,

53
00:06:35,186 --> 00:06:36,854
or I might just steal him away.

54
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:39,440
Did you purchase that diamond

55
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:41,442
or just seduce it onto your finger?

56
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:45,363
Oof, hold on to that one, love,

57
00:06:45,446 --> 00:06:47,156
or I might just steal her away.

58
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:50,827
Excuse me.

59
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:52,829
This little kitty needs
to powder her nose.

60
00:06:57,875 --> 00:07:01,045
[vault whirring]

61
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:05,675
There. Now let's return to the party.

62
00:07:07,635 --> 00:07:09,429
Oh, I heard about Sochi.

63
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:10,972
Most unfortunate.

64
00:07:11,306 --> 00:07:13,391
It was a promising operation.

65
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:16,144
Mm-hmm. I will only say this once.

66
00:07:16,311 --> 00:07:18,730
Sochi was a minor setback.

67
00:07:19,188 --> 00:07:21,024
These things happen sometimes.

68
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:24,569
The point, of course,
is that our operation

69
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:27,363
is large enough to absorb such losses.

70
00:07:28,323 --> 00:07:29,657
Don't let it concern you.

71
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:34,120

00:07:40,752 --> 00:07:42,003
- [alarm buzzing]
- Oh, come on.

73
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:44,047
[sighs] It's that darn cat again.

74
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:45,757
I told you to catch him.

75
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:48,134
You ever tried catching a cat
on a hot tiled roof?

76
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:51,095
This is like the 80th time
he's set off the motion sensors.

77
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:52,347
The boss is gonna to kill us

78
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:53,973
if the alarm disturbs her guests.

79
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:55,850
Just shut it off. Shut it off!

80
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:59,062
[man 1] Yeah, yeah, we don't need
the motion sensors.

81
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:00,438
We still got the cameras.

82
00:08:00,521 --> 00:08:02,023
- [man 2] Exactly!
- [Isis meowing]

83
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:22,001
You know, I appreciate the classics,

84
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:24,045
but I move with the times.

[beeping]

87
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:49,070
Hmm. Cameras are so much easier to fool

88
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:50,446
than motion sensors.

89
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:52,532
You get picked for the out of town trip?

90
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:53,866
Nah. You?

91
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,827
[scoffs] I wish. One night's work

92
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:57,412
and four nights enjoying wherever.

93
00:08:57,495 --> 00:08:58,788
Would have been sweet, you know?

94
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:01,249
[man 2] Yeah. Sucks being a Grade 3.

95
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:03,000
We never get the soft gigs.

[gasps] The cat's eye emerald!

00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:30,022
[gasps] Darling, you're even
more gorgeous in person.

103
00:11:38,281 --> 00:11:40,950
Yes! Purr-fect match.

104
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:46,455
I'm smiling, too.

[alarm blaring]

108
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:53,838
I am no longer smiling.

109
00:11:56,465 --> 00:11:59,051
Not smiling at all.

110
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:00,219
[grunts]

111
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:04,724
That perfect crime
went south awfully fast.

112
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:07,143
Remind me to lay a few choice words

113
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:09,353
on the bat the next time I see him.

114
00:12:13,316 --> 00:12:14,817
- Open fire!

116
00:12:18,362 --> 00:12:19,196
Get her!

[effort grunts]

121
00:12:42,678 --> 00:12:45,097
Stop her! All of you!

122
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:47,850
- Now!
- [yelling] Now!

123

[grunting]

124
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:56,400
All right. No need to get excited.

125
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:58,903
I thought this was supposed
to be a party.

126
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:04,367
Ooh, my kind of party.

127
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:06,285
Out of the way, you idiots.

128
00:13:06,369 --> 00:13:07,411
Excuse me.

Here, try the caviar.

[Catwoman] Is this your guy?

140

Hold on tight
or I might just steal him away.

Ah, I love your pearls.

143
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,122
Might just steal those away too.

[woman screaming]

145
00:13:56,794 --> 00:13:59,088
I don't believe
we've been properly introduced.

146
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:01,048
The name's Selina Kyle,

147
00:14:01,298 --> 00:14:02,550
but please,

148
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:05,177
call me Catwoman.

Move!

Aw, thanks for keeping her close.

- [meowing]
- [valet] Your key, <i>senorita!</i>

156
00:14:26,615 --> 00:14:29,535
- You give her the key, you die.
- <i>Si, senor.</i>

157
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:31,662
It's okay. I have a spare.

- [engine accelerating]
- Lovely party.

161
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:38,127
Hate to steal and run.

[engine revving]

163
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:46,635
- The keys, damn it.
- <i>Si, senor.</i>

164
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:49,138
Mount up! Take all of them.

165
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:50,931
- You, drive.
- Yes, Sir.

166
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:52,767
Move, all of you!

167
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:54,435
She's not getting away.

Good girl.

172
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:25,382
Don't want to lose that little pretty.

173
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:27,510
It would kind of defeat
the whole purpose of the evening.

[tires screeching]

175
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:37,853
Speed up.

176
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,688
Trying not to drive off the cliff.

177
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:42,525
Speed up or I'll throw you
off the cliff.

178
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:44,401
- Yes, Sir.

Why aren't you firing?

181
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:58,791
Because we don't want her damn car

182
00:15:58,874 --> 00:16:01,585
flying off the damn cliff
with the damn emerald!

183
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:03,087
Oh, yeah, right.

184
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:04,296
Idiot.

185
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:08,968
Go, do it!

186
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:22,022
[smirks]

187
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:24,608
Clearly, this fool's never
had a date in his life

188
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:26,944
or he'd know a woman can lay a man low

189
00:16:27,027 --> 00:16:29,029
with a single swish of her hips.

190
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:31,490
[tires screeching]

191
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:33,284
[screams]

192
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:57,433
Pull over, or we'll make you pull over!

193
00:16:57,641 --> 00:16:59,685
Oh, sorry. Can't.

194
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:02,521
I'm being chased
by some truly horrible people.

195
00:17:02,605 --> 00:17:04,899
And if I pull over, they might catch me.

196
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:06,775
[grunts] Pincer!

197
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:11,447
[scoffs] Did you just tell him
to pinch me?

198
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:13,741
That's really inappropriate, young man.

199
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:17,661
Not "pinch her." "Pincer." Pincer!

200
00:17:17,786 --> 00:17:19,163
Oh, well, that's very different.

201
00:17:19,246 --> 00:17:20,331
Never mind.

202
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:22,458
Just do it!

203
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:25,419
[tires screeching]

204
00:17:25,502 --> 00:17:26,921
[grunts]

205
00:17:27,338 --> 00:17:28,464
[meows]

206
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:32,927
I know. That was almost
worse than a pinch.

207
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:35,054
Again. Hold her this time.

208
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:46,023
[screaming]

209
00:18:03,374 --> 00:18:04,416
[gasps]

210
00:18:06,377 --> 00:18:07,836
[tires screeching]

211
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:48,043
Now, let's see if we can lose
those unwanted suitors.

212
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,128
[gunshot]

213
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:51,046
Now I can shoot.

214
00:18:51,422 --> 00:18:52,298
[gunshot]

215
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:53,757
[tires screeching]

216
00:18:57,886 --> 00:18:59,054
Cut her off.

217
00:19:04,727 --> 00:19:06,395
- Get ready.
- For what?

218
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:07,479
For your shot!

219
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:08,981
Oh, yeah. Right.

220
00:19:19,325 --> 00:19:20,951
- I said get up!
- [grunting]

221
00:19:21,035 --> 00:19:22,119
[screams]

222
00:19:24,913 --> 00:19:27,624
Okay. Now you pull over, or you die.

223
00:19:28,042 --> 00:19:29,460
Is that an order?

224
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:31,420
That's exactly what it is.

225
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:33,255
[screams]

226
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:35,632
You see, the thing is,

227
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:37,259
I don't do well with orders.

228
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:38,344
[meows]

229
00:19:38,469 --> 00:19:40,679
Oh, sorry, baby.

230
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:42,139
Mommy will fix it.

231
00:19:42,389 --> 00:19:43,390
[grunting]

232
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:47,436
[screams, grunts]

233
00:19:50,939 --> 00:19:53,275
There, doors are locked

234
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:55,361
and no one else is getting in.

235
00:19:57,905 --> 00:19:59,114
[meows]

236
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:00,324
[Catwoman] Yes, I know.

237
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:02,242
We're in a convertible. Ugh.

238
00:20:02,493 --> 00:20:05,204
It was a symbolic gesture.
I swear, Isis,

239
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:07,247
for a cat, you are so literal-minded.

240
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:08,749
[gasps]

241
00:20:18,842 --> 00:20:19,927
[gunshots]

242
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:28,102
[man 1 grunts]
Come on! Get the doors open!

243
00:20:28,185 --> 00:20:29,269
[man 2] They're stuck!

244
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,907
The street widens up ahead.

245
00:20:42,408 --> 00:20:43,617
Pull alongside.

246
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:44,952
Roger that, boss.

247
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:54,920
[grunts]

248
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:57,631
Honey, you should really watch
where you're going.

249
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:03,887
[Whale screams]

250
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:10,144
[grunts]

251
00:21:10,894 --> 00:21:11,979
[growls]

252
00:21:13,313 --> 00:21:14,189
[exhales]

253
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:17,443
Boss? Boss? A little help?

254
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:20,320
Please?

255
00:21:20,737 --> 00:21:22,406
There, you see?

256
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:24,658
I told you we'd get away clean.

257
00:21:26,452 --> 00:21:28,495
Yeah, you never doubted it
for a moment, right?

258
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:30,998
[gasps]

259
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:47,764
- [meows]
- [groans]

260
00:21:52,478 --> 00:21:53,854
Oh, great.

261
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:56,023
Congratulations, Selina.

262
00:21:56,106 --> 00:21:58,358
You just became
Leviathan's number one target.

263
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:00,986
[grunts]

264
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:10,496
[Whale grunts]

265
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:16,084
Mm.

266
00:22:18,587 --> 00:22:20,005
[chuckles]

267
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:29,264
Mm-hmm.

268
00:22:29,556 --> 00:22:30,933
It is the real thing.

269
00:22:31,266 --> 00:22:33,685
And I'm supposed to thank you
for recovering it?

270
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:35,896
I put it in your hands, in your vault.

271
00:22:36,271 --> 00:22:39,441
I thought Leviathan
had better security than this.

272
00:22:43,237 --> 00:22:45,906
[Minerva] I'm not the one
who escorted her into the party.

273
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:47,574
Hmm.

274
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:48,575
[clears throat]

275
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:50,494
Uh, apologies.

276
00:22:50,577 --> 00:22:53,830
I suppose mistakes were made
on all sides

277
00:22:53,914 --> 00:22:56,917
and in the end, no harm done.

278
00:22:57,501 --> 00:22:59,253
Oh, harm was done.

279
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:01,713
This little kitten
has sauntered into the lair

280
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:03,215
of the wrong big cat.

281
00:23:03,966 --> 00:23:05,551
Such an affront must not stand.

282
00:23:06,134 --> 00:23:07,469
And I promise you,

283
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:10,597
Selina Kyle will not go unpunished.

284
00:23:20,524 --> 00:23:21,775
[meows]

285
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:25,445
Oh, Isis, stop!

286
00:23:26,446 --> 00:23:28,198
Mama's trying to sleep.

287
00:23:28,699 --> 00:23:30,784
[Batwoman] Mama should be trying
to stay out of prison.

288
00:23:31,034 --> 00:23:32,327
[groans]

289
00:23:32,786 --> 00:23:34,288
[grunts] Ugh.

290
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:39,960
Ugh, if I'd have known it was you,
I wouldn't have hit the brakes.

291
00:23:40,377 --> 00:23:42,212
Please. You knew it was me.

292
00:23:42,879 --> 00:23:44,172
I see my cat.

293
00:23:44,715 --> 00:23:46,300
I don't see my cat's eye emerald.

294
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:49,344
Nope, I left that behind
for Whale to find.

295
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:52,180
Wait. That batarang...

296
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:53,682
Here it comes.

297
00:23:54,391 --> 00:23:55,434
That was you.

298
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:57,227
Almost there.

299
00:23:57,311 --> 00:24:00,939
You screwed up my extremely
well-planned heist on purpose?

300
00:24:01,523 --> 00:24:03,275
See? I knew you'd put it together.

301
00:24:03,358 --> 00:24:05,277
[scoffs] Wow. Seriously,

302
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,195
you are such a little do-gooder,

303
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:09,323
you won't even let
a harmless sneak thief

304
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:10,949
steal from gangsters?

305
00:24:11,742 --> 00:24:12,618
You're not harmless.

306
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:14,745
And Barbara Minerva is no mere gangster.

307
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:16,788
Really?

308
00:24:16,872 --> 00:24:18,040
Well, do tell.

309
00:24:18,749 --> 00:24:19,875
Come on.

310
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:21,418
Enlighten me.

311
00:24:21,627 --> 00:24:23,045
Ugh, no, thanks.

312
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:24,713
I know you're just stalling for time,

313
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:26,840
trying to figure out
your little escape plan.

314
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:32,346
No, no. I can see escape
isn't in my near future

315
00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:34,139
since we're aboard a private jet.

316
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:37,768
A jet flying east, if I'm not mistaken.

317
00:24:38,685 --> 00:24:40,771
Mm, very good.

318
00:24:40,854 --> 00:24:42,064
Introductions.

319
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:44,107
Selina Kyle, meet Interpol agents

320
00:24:44,191 --> 00:24:46,360
Julia Pennyworth and King Faraday.

321
00:24:46,777 --> 00:24:48,195
We're already acquainted.

322
00:24:48,945 --> 00:24:50,322
Unfortunately.

323
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:54,076
Oh, Julia. King.

324
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:57,162
Is that any way
to talk to an old friend?

325
00:24:57,537 --> 00:24:59,122
Selina, we're not friends.

326
00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:01,124
I'm a police officer. You're a thief.

327
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:04,544
Oh, and you're clearly corrupt

328
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:06,338
because the last time I checked,

329
00:25:06,421 --> 00:25:09,549
civil servants didn't rate
luxury accommodations

330
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:11,843
like these. [moans]

331
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:14,221
We confiscated the jet from the Penguin.

332
00:25:15,305 --> 00:25:17,808
Oh, that explains it.

333
00:25:17,974 --> 00:25:21,353
For a flightless bird, Oswald
always did love the high life.

334
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,444
So, other than east,

335
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:31,655
where exactly are we headed?

336
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:33,281
[Julia] We don't know yet.

337
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:36,118
Can't you just, uh, ask the pilot?

338
00:25:37,744 --> 00:25:39,454
We're tracking Black Mask and Minerva.

339
00:25:39,705 --> 00:25:41,957
Thanks to a liquid tracker
I sprayed on the emerald

340
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:44,251
in Gotham prior
to Black Mask acquiring it.

341
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:49,506
Oh, so that's why
you thought it was essential

342
00:25:49,631 --> 00:25:53,093
that the Cat's Eye
stay with its current owners.

343
00:25:53,969 --> 00:25:55,554
[Julia] Minerva is stepping up.

344
00:25:55,637 --> 00:25:57,389
She's built her Leviathan
Crime Syndicate

345
00:25:57,472 --> 00:26:00,142
on narcotics, blackmail,
human trafficking, etcetera.

346
00:26:00,726 --> 00:26:02,477
It's now richer than many countries.

347
00:26:03,103 --> 00:26:04,521
[slurps] Mm.

348
00:26:05,147 --> 00:26:07,023
Penguin does know his bubbly.

349
00:26:08,191 --> 00:26:10,736
I am glad it suits your tastes.

350
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:13,155
And what suits yours, King?

351
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:15,824
As if I don't already know.

352
00:26:16,158 --> 00:26:19,369
Well, what would suit me
is, uh, [clears throat]

353
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:21,830
Interpol taking Leviathan apart

354
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:24,666
while I slap cuffs
on Lady Barbara Minerva.

355
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:27,169
So do it.

356
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:29,129
Not just yet.

357
00:26:29,337 --> 00:26:31,298
Tracking Minerva and Mask will lead us

358
00:26:31,381 --> 00:26:33,759
to a meeting of the entire
criminal cartel

359
00:26:33,842 --> 00:26:35,677
that Black Mask
is currently trying to join

360
00:26:35,802 --> 00:26:37,804
using the eye as his entrance fee.

361
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:41,641
Which has exactly what to do with me?

362
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:49,191
Multiple countries have
multiple warrants out for your arrest.

363
00:26:49,649 --> 00:26:51,818
I always was popular.

364
00:26:52,527 --> 00:26:54,988
You have been on
quite the global tear lately.

365
00:26:55,363 --> 00:26:57,949
You would think jewel thievery
had an expiration date.

366
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,118
Why the sudden rush?

367
00:27:00,911 --> 00:27:03,246
You're usually much lazier than that.

368
00:27:03,413 --> 00:27:08,084
[sighs] Languid, not lazy.

369
00:27:11,254 --> 00:27:14,591
I can take action
when properly motivated.

370
00:27:15,258 --> 00:27:17,761
As luck would have it,
we'd like to offer you motivation.

371
00:27:18,386 --> 00:27:21,306
Oh, I'm listening.

372
00:27:22,265 --> 00:27:26,269
You help us bust Minerva,
Black Mask and the rest of Leviathan,

373
00:27:26,686 --> 00:27:29,231
and we make
all those warrants disappear.

374
00:27:30,607 --> 00:27:31,817
Okay.

375
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:35,654
And if I pass on said generous offer?

376
00:27:36,404 --> 00:27:37,405
Incarceration.

377
00:27:38,448 --> 00:27:40,742
We're talking about
your freedom, Selina.

378
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:43,161
If you cooperate.

379
00:27:44,913 --> 00:27:46,873
Cooperate how?

380
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:49,209
By making yourself a target.

381
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:57,843
[Minerva] The line's secure.

382
00:27:58,593 --> 00:28:00,512
You've been
apprised of the circumstances?

383
00:28:01,638 --> 00:28:02,722
Good.

384
00:28:04,057 --> 00:28:06,852
Then I believe you'll agree
an example must be made.

385
00:28:08,436 --> 00:28:10,522
Catwoman must die,

386
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:14,234
so let me know if you need me
to provide resources.

387
00:28:14,651 --> 00:28:15,944
[Talia] <i>Not necessary.</i>

388
00:28:16,111 --> 00:28:18,572
<i>I never cared for that feline.</i>

389
00:28:19,906 --> 00:28:23,326
<i>And I have just
the right woman for the job.</i>

390
00:28:52,355 --> 00:28:53,315
Shanghai?

391
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:56,026
[Julia] Mm, you know your airstrips.

392
00:28:56,151 --> 00:28:58,153
In my line of work, it pays to.

393
00:28:58,486 --> 00:29:00,071
[Julia] The Cat's Eye landed here.

394
00:29:02,115 --> 00:29:05,285
Meaning Minerva's plane landed here.

395
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:06,620
[Faraday] Exactly.

396
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:11,917
[mechanical whirring]

397
00:29:13,835 --> 00:29:15,670
Pennyworth and I will track
Minerva and Mask

398
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:18,214
to the exact location
of the cartel meet.

399
00:29:18,298 --> 00:29:20,467
- You'll keep an eye on our guest?
- Of course.

400
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:23,470
[sighs] Better make it two eyes.

401
00:29:24,054 --> 00:29:28,266
I'm famously slippery,
especially when wet.

402
00:29:28,934 --> 00:29:29,893
Excuse me?

403
00:29:32,228 --> 00:29:33,438
I'm going to take a bath.

404
00:29:34,022 --> 00:29:36,733
Ooh. A bubble bath.

405
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,860
Good luck with that one.

406
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:40,528
[Batwoman] Yeah, thanks.

407
00:29:46,701 --> 00:29:47,953
[mechanical whirring]

408
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:55,126
[Selina] Just us girls left, huh?

409
00:29:58,421 --> 00:30:00,799
Oh. Nice and hot.

410
00:30:01,758 --> 00:30:04,219
- Want to test it?
- Yeah, I'll trust you on that.

411
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:06,596
Pretty much only on that.

412
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:10,308
No. Such a suspicious mind.

413
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:18,274
Now, we'll just give
the bubbles a little time

414
00:30:18,358 --> 00:30:21,236
to work their [inhales] scented magic.

415
00:30:21,987 --> 00:30:23,113
Meanwhile...

416
00:30:28,868 --> 00:30:32,914
There's a question that
I have been dying to ask you.

417
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:39,879
Whenever I wear a wig,
[sighs] I get so hot.

418
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:42,007
I mean, don't get me wrong,

419
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:43,800
I love role-playing.

420
00:30:44,384 --> 00:30:46,928
It's a disguise, not role-play.

421
00:30:47,012 --> 00:30:50,807
But on those steamy,
sultry Gotham nights,

422
00:30:51,558 --> 00:30:54,269
I bet you can't wait to...

423
00:30:56,104 --> 00:30:57,897
[whispering] take it off.

424
00:30:59,149 --> 00:31:00,608
You know what I mean?

425
00:31:01,776 --> 00:31:02,694
Mm-hmm.

426
00:31:06,906 --> 00:31:09,117
I think the bubbles are
probably ready now.

427
00:31:09,492 --> 00:31:10,368
[Batwoman grunts softly]

428
00:31:14,414 --> 00:31:17,250
And it's such a large tub.

429
00:31:18,585 --> 00:31:19,961
[gasps softly]

430
00:31:20,754 --> 00:31:24,257
I suppose it wouldn't do
any harm if we...

431
00:31:25,258 --> 00:31:27,260
Oh, sorry, Katie.

432
00:31:30,764 --> 00:31:32,390
Cats bathe themselves.

433
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:36,770
Of course, you're
more than welcome to watch.

434
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:39,439
If that's how you get your kicks.

435
00:31:39,606 --> 00:31:41,107
No, damn it, I...

436
00:31:42,025 --> 00:31:43,193
I'll be in the cockpit,

437
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:45,695
monitoring Faraday
and Pennyworth's progress.

438
00:31:48,865 --> 00:31:51,451
But don't think for a moment
you can escape this plane.

439
00:31:52,077 --> 00:31:54,287
No, wouldn't dream of it.

440
00:31:55,371 --> 00:31:56,289
[grunts angrily]

441
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:07,300
Gotta love Bat family tech.

442
00:32:07,467 --> 00:32:09,677
Waterproof and bubble-proof.

443
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:11,346
[line ringing]

444
00:32:11,971 --> 00:32:14,474
Holly, it's me. Yeah.

445
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:17,852
Well, let's just say
I borrowed the phone

446
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:20,605
while the owner's attention
was elsewhere.

447
00:32:22,649 --> 00:32:24,359
I know, I know, I know,

448
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:27,737
but the job's taking just
a little bit longer than we planned.

449
00:32:28,321 --> 00:32:29,322
How's Anya?

450
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:32,033
What about the other girls?

451
00:32:34,244 --> 00:32:35,912
Okay, understood.

452
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:41,668
But don't worry,
Isis and I will see all of you very soon

453
00:32:41,751 --> 00:32:45,338
with enough scratch,
so they never have to be afraid again.

454
00:32:46,047 --> 00:32:46,881
I promise.

455
00:33:01,187 --> 00:33:03,356
[Minerva] Ladies and gentlemen
of Leviathan,

456
00:33:03,731 --> 00:33:06,359
allow me to introduce
prospective member,

457
00:33:06,442 --> 00:33:09,362
Roman Sionis, known as Black Mask.

458
00:33:09,696 --> 00:33:13,408
The reason why he is here
is because his control

459
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:15,952
of the Eastern Seaboard cartel
in the States

460
00:33:16,578 --> 00:33:18,246
should make an important addition

461
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:20,915
to our control of the global underworld.

462
00:33:21,082 --> 00:33:23,293
And he brought the price of admission.

463
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:34,637
All in favor
of confirming his candidacy?

464
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:44,564
[all] Aye.

465
00:33:45,607 --> 00:33:46,733
[Minerva] Opposed?

466
00:33:49,402 --> 00:33:52,822
Oh, look at that. Unanimously confirmed.

467
00:33:54,157 --> 00:33:55,867
Welcome to Leviathan, Roman.

468
00:33:57,785 --> 00:34:01,789
[Black Mask] I am truly honored
to join this venerable assembly.

469
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:06,252
- I assume you know everyone.
- Only by reputation.

470
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:09,714
Forgive me. Then I'm being rude.

471
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:13,384
This is Oyabun Noguri,
known of Mr. Yakuza.

472
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:14,969
Head of the Japanese cartel.

473
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:17,722
An honor.

474
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:20,683
The honor is mine, Noguri-Sama.

475
00:34:22,101 --> 00:34:25,021
Dr. Tzin Zhao Tzin,
head of the Chinese cartel.

476
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:28,107
- Doctor.
- Mr. Mask.

477
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:32,070
At the appropriate time,
I'd love to pick your brain.

478
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:33,780
About?

479
00:34:33,863 --> 00:34:36,824
[chuckles] I'm sure
we'll think of something.

480
00:34:39,202 --> 00:34:40,036
Also over here,

481
00:34:40,203 --> 00:34:43,039
let me introduce you to Amparo Cardenas,

482
00:34:43,122 --> 00:34:46,459
known as La Dama. Head of
the Central American cartel.

483
00:34:49,712 --> 00:34:51,214
Charmed.

484
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:55,802
[chuckles] Your mask
fascinates me, <i>Senor</i> Sionis.

485
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:58,846
It seems at first an affectation,

486
00:34:59,013 --> 00:35:01,641
a nod to the so-called mystery men

487
00:35:01,724 --> 00:35:03,226
who attempt to plague us.

488
00:35:03,726 --> 00:35:06,312
But, I suppose,
we all wear masks of a sort.

489
00:35:06,437 --> 00:35:07,939
[Black Mask] Indeed.

490
00:35:08,314 --> 00:35:11,442
I have simply chosen not to hide mine.

491
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:13,569
I understand.

492
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:15,989
I believe you and I will enjoy

493
00:35:16,072 --> 00:35:18,741
the fruits of
our shared hemisphere, Roman.

494
00:35:18,992 --> 00:35:21,327
I look forward to sharing.

495
00:35:25,164 --> 00:35:26,207
[clears throat]

496
00:35:30,086 --> 00:35:32,005
And I believe you know Moxie Mannheim.

497
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:36,509
[Black Mask] Sure.

498
00:35:38,177 --> 00:35:39,178
[Moxie] Yeah.

499
00:35:41,055 --> 00:35:42,515
Now, now, boys.

500
00:35:42,598 --> 00:35:45,601
Leviathan is one big happy family.

501
00:35:45,852 --> 00:35:48,521
Old conflicts must stay in the past.

502
00:35:48,938 --> 00:35:50,398
You all have your prescribed roles,

503
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:52,567
your prescribed arenas and territories.

504
00:35:52,775 --> 00:35:55,153
Black Mask runs the Eastern Seaboard.

505
00:35:55,236 --> 00:35:56,779
Boss Moxie heads Intergang,

506
00:35:56,863 --> 00:35:58,823
Leviathan's interstellar arms dealer.

507
00:35:59,073 --> 00:36:00,825
I trust you can both play nice?

508
00:36:05,747 --> 00:36:06,748
- Yeah.
- Sure.

509
00:36:07,915 --> 00:36:09,542
Speaking of territories,

510
00:36:10,043 --> 00:36:14,047
what of our attempt to, uh,
colonize Southern Russia?

511
00:36:14,213 --> 00:36:17,008
Yes, our failure in Sochi

512
00:36:17,091 --> 00:36:19,177
has given each of us...

513
00:36:19,635 --> 00:36:21,596
- Pause?
- Precisely.

514
00:36:22,347 --> 00:36:23,890
Sochi was a setback,

515
00:36:23,973 --> 00:36:25,475
certainly, but I believe

516
00:36:25,558 --> 00:36:27,435
I can quickly allay any concerns.

517
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:36,486
[Batwoman] Holding pattern established.

518
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:39,947
We could get the call at any minute.

519
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:41,532
I assume you're ready for action.

520
00:36:41,783 --> 00:36:46,245
Aw, Katie, dear, this kitten's
always ready for action.

521
00:36:46,454 --> 00:36:49,916
All right, Selina, enough with
the faux sexual tension.

522
00:36:50,124 --> 00:36:53,795
Honey, there's nothing faux about it.

523
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:55,213
Come on, Cat.

524
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:57,256
[angrily] Don't call me Cat.

525
00:36:57,507 --> 00:37:01,302
Wait. I can call you Selina,
but I can't call you Cat?

526
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:04,347
Which is, in case you hadn't noticed,

527
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:05,973
short for Catwoman.

528
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:10,311
- Only he calls me Cat.
- Oh.

529
00:37:10,603 --> 00:37:12,146
[Julia on speaker] <i>JP One to Flight One.</i>

530
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:14,774
This is Flight One.
Do you have the location?

531
00:37:14,982 --> 00:37:15,817
[Julia] <i>Roger that.</i>

532
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:18,277
<i>KF One just needs time to get
his ducks in a row.</i>

533
00:37:18,444 --> 00:37:21,155
<i>We don't want any of the cartel leaders
to escape our dragnet.</i>

534
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:23,783
<i>We need a distraction to keep
the bad guys busy and on site.</i>

535
00:37:23,991 --> 00:37:24,992
<i>Sending coordinates.</i>

536
00:37:25,368 --> 00:37:27,036
Okay, distraction. You're up.

537
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:28,663
Uh, yeah.

538
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:31,624
I am up. About 1,000 feet up.

539
00:37:31,999 --> 00:37:33,209
When do we land?

540
00:37:33,292 --> 00:37:35,128
We're not landing. There isn't time.

541
00:37:35,586 --> 00:37:38,047
Do you see wings on this feline?

542
00:37:38,131 --> 00:37:39,424
Cats don't fly.

543
00:37:42,009 --> 00:37:43,219
We had a deal.

544
00:37:43,302 --> 00:37:45,763
No, you had a deal.

545
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:47,640
I was being blackmailed.

546
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:49,475
Deal, extortion.

547
00:37:49,559 --> 00:37:51,060
Let's not get caught up in semantics.

548
00:37:58,276 --> 00:37:59,235
[Faraday on speaker] <i>Approaching drop.</i>

549
00:38:00,611 --> 00:38:02,697
Jump here, or jump into a prison cell

550
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:04,198
for 20 years to life.

551
00:38:04,407 --> 00:38:06,242
Ugh, fine.

552
00:38:06,409 --> 00:38:07,994
Here. This will help us keep in touch.

553
00:38:08,828 --> 00:38:09,996
Oh, joy.

554
00:38:10,913 --> 00:38:12,582
Try these instead.

555
00:38:12,707 --> 00:38:13,958
I think you'll like "em.

556
00:38:20,756 --> 00:38:21,799
[Faraday] <i>Drop in ten.</i>

557
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:32,810
<i>Drop in five, four,
three, two, one, drop.</i>

558
00:38:39,484 --> 00:38:42,111
Flight One to JP One. The Cat's away.

559
00:38:42,278 --> 00:38:44,906
- [Julia] <i>Any problems?</i>
- Uh, she balked a little.

560
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:47,241
- <i>Only a little?</i>
- Yeah, I know.

561
00:38:47,533 --> 00:38:49,035
Suspicious.

562
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:54,207
Ha! So maybe cats can fly.

563
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:56,876
No wonder Superman's such a happy guy.

564
00:38:56,959 --> 00:38:58,544
Flying kinda rocks.

565
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:00,463
[Batwoman] <i>Deploy chute, Selina,</i>

566
00:39:00,546 --> 00:39:03,132
<i>before you find out
Just how poorly rocks fly.</i>

567
00:39:03,466 --> 00:39:05,551
No! Killjoy.

568
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:06,677
<i>I've been called worse.</i>

569
00:39:07,929 --> 00:39:11,599
[Catwoman whooping, laughing]

570
00:39:12,767 --> 00:39:14,393
[Batwoman] <i>All right,
I'm very glad you're having fun.</i>

571
00:39:14,477 --> 00:39:16,938
<i>Press the button
on the side of the goggles.</i>

572
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:18,981
I could do that,

573
00:39:19,065 --> 00:39:20,691
but now that I'm out of the plane,

574
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:22,693
what makes you think
I'm not going to bail on

575
00:39:22,777 --> 00:39:24,278
this whole endeavor?

576
00:39:24,654 --> 00:39:26,113
<i>Well, I have your cat.</i>

577
00:39:28,241 --> 00:39:29,242
Pressing button.

578
00:39:32,828 --> 00:39:36,249
Oh, wow! You were right.

579
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:38,543
I like the goggles.

580
00:39:42,547 --> 00:39:43,506
<i>Target acquired?</i>

581
00:39:44,757 --> 00:39:46,342
Target acquired.

582
00:39:55,434 --> 00:39:57,103
[grunts]

583
00:39:59,689 --> 00:40:02,108
- <i>You good?</i>
- [scoffs] Please!

584
00:40:02,275 --> 00:40:03,818
A cat always...

585
00:40:03,901 --> 00:40:05,319
<i>Yeah, yeah, lands on her feet.</i>

586
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:08,281
<i>I've heard the saying. Don't you ever
get tired of all that cat schtick?</i>

587
00:40:08,948 --> 00:40:10,700
Oh, seriously?

588
00:40:11,117 --> 00:40:14,203
Do you really want to get into
a schtick war,

589
00:40:14,537 --> 00:40:16,497
Batwoman? [chuckles]

590
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:18,874
I didn't think so.

591
00:40:33,723 --> 00:40:36,058
[Cheshire] Here, kitty, Kitty.

592
00:40:38,603 --> 00:40:43,357
Now, what's a nice feline
like you doing in a place like this?

593
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:46,277
I could ask you
the same question, Cheshire.

594
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:49,030
[Cheshire] Uh-uh. I asked first.

595
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:50,531
I'm a jewel thief.

596
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:52,366
I came here to steal the jewel.

597
00:40:52,658 --> 00:40:54,660
[Cheshire] And I am
a League of Shadows assassin.

598
00:40:54,827 --> 00:40:57,830
I came here to kill the jewel thief.

599
00:40:58,748 --> 00:41:00,499
You came here to try.

600
00:41:00,625 --> 00:41:02,543
[Cheshire] Catfight?

601
00:41:03,336 --> 00:41:04,545
Catfight.

602
00:41:09,884 --> 00:41:11,802
[both grunting]

603
00:41:19,602 --> 00:41:22,313
[Cheshire grunts]

604
00:41:23,439 --> 00:41:26,484
- [Cheshire grunts]
- Oh, come on! Not the face.

605
00:41:26,692 --> 00:41:29,737
That's my moneymaker, or one of them.

606
00:41:30,279 --> 00:41:31,405
[Cheshire] Not for long.

607
00:41:32,073 --> 00:41:33,491
Jellyfish toxin.

608
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:37,286
Yeah. You used that on me last time.

609
00:41:37,578 --> 00:41:39,914
Since then, I made sure
to build up an immunity.

610
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:43,209
[Cheshire sighs] I have got to find
some new toxins.

611
00:41:45,419 --> 00:41:47,380
Mm, I don't know, Chesh.

612
00:41:47,463 --> 00:41:50,424
Poison doesn't really fit
the whole cat motif.

613
00:41:50,549 --> 00:41:52,468
[Cheshire] I'm expanding the trope!

614
00:41:52,593 --> 00:41:53,636
[grunts]

615
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:57,515
[Cheshire grunts]

616
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:02,436
- [Catwoman grunts]
- [Cheshire yells]

617
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:06,315
- [Catwoman groans]
- [Cheshire grunts]

618
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:14,490
- [Cheshire yells]
- [Catwoman groans]

619
00:42:17,284 --> 00:42:20,204
- [Catwoman groans in pain]
- Nighty-night, Kitty.

620
00:42:21,455 --> 00:42:23,082
[Cheshire grunts]

621
00:42:29,672 --> 00:42:31,006
[both] Batwoman?

622
00:42:31,173 --> 00:42:32,258
[Catwoman] Why are you here?

623
00:42:33,676 --> 00:42:35,386
[Batwoman sighs] It's not by choice.

624
00:42:35,469 --> 00:42:37,763
Your cat was going berserk on the plane.

625
00:42:38,013 --> 00:42:40,099
You know, she's small,
but she is a monster.

626
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:46,355
[Catwoman] Yeah, Isis is
way too dignified for berserk.

627
00:42:46,856 --> 00:42:48,983
[Cheshire] I think she's here
as your back-up.

628
00:42:49,275 --> 00:42:51,569
Oh, is that true?

629
00:42:52,069 --> 00:42:53,779
Are you my back-up?

630
00:42:54,196 --> 00:42:56,073
[sighs] Maybe.

631
00:42:58,367 --> 00:43:00,786
In any case, it's two against one.

632
00:43:00,953 --> 00:43:01,954
[Isis meows]

633
00:43:02,663 --> 00:43:03,831
Three against one.

634
00:43:04,331 --> 00:43:05,166
[Isis meows]

635
00:43:06,333 --> 00:43:07,668
Okay, two against one.

636
00:43:08,085 --> 00:43:09,754
[Cheshire] Am I supposed to
be impressed?

637
00:43:10,671 --> 00:43:14,008
I mean, it's not called
the League of Shadows for nothing.

638
00:43:25,144 --> 00:43:27,521
[snarling]

639
00:43:28,105 --> 00:43:30,191
Uh, who is that?

640
00:43:30,357 --> 00:43:32,777
I am Nosferata.

641
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:34,653
I'm new.

642
00:43:35,571 --> 00:43:38,073
You've got your bat, I've got mine.

643
00:43:39,241 --> 00:43:40,743
- She's not my bat!
- I'm not her bat.

644
00:43:42,411 --> 00:43:45,080
Then I guess you belong to me.

645
00:43:46,373 --> 00:43:48,751
- [Nosferata grunts]
- [Batwoman groans]

646
00:43:58,511 --> 00:43:59,345
[Cheshire yells]

647
00:44:08,312 --> 00:44:10,648
What do you call a bat without wings?

648
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:12,817
What is this? Are you The Riddler?

649
00:44:15,402 --> 00:44:17,404
You call her roadkill.

650
00:44:19,573 --> 00:44:20,783
[snarls viciously]

651
00:44:23,452 --> 00:44:24,662
Hey! What the...

652
00:44:24,870 --> 00:44:27,081
I don't have wings, but yours will do.

653
00:44:28,624 --> 00:44:30,292
Yeah, we'll see about that.

654
00:44:40,636 --> 00:44:42,054
[both grunting]

655
00:44:43,556 --> 00:44:45,516
Well, they seem to be getting along.

656
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:49,270
Well, sure.

657
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:51,313
Those bats like to pretend
they're loners,

658
00:44:51,397 --> 00:44:53,816
but there's a whole cave
full of them back in Gotham.

659
00:44:54,066 --> 00:44:55,901
I hear you would know. [chuckles]

660
00:44:56,068 --> 00:44:57,778
We're not discussing that.

661
00:44:58,279 --> 00:44:59,822
[Cheshire grunts]

662
00:44:59,989 --> 00:45:02,616
Oh, touchy subject?

663
00:45:02,741 --> 00:45:04,869
Listen, you grinning idiot.

664
00:45:05,035 --> 00:45:07,413
You really don't want to make me mad.

665
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:09,790
[Cheshire grunts, groans]

666
00:45:14,837 --> 00:45:17,923
- [Nosferata grunts]
- [Batwoman groans]

667
00:45:20,384 --> 00:45:21,343
[Nosferata grunts triumphantly]

668
00:45:22,678 --> 00:45:24,430
[grunts angrily]

669
00:45:27,683 --> 00:45:30,352
- [explosion]
- [Nosferata yelps]

670
00:45:36,525 --> 00:45:38,235
[Batwoman grunts angrily]

671
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:42,573
[both grunting]

672
00:45:54,877 --> 00:45:55,711
[Black Mask] What was that?

673
00:45:58,213 --> 00:45:59,924
Retribution, perhaps.

674
00:46:01,175 --> 00:46:03,552
[grunts]

675
00:46:04,136 --> 00:46:05,930
[grunting, straining]

676
00:46:12,353 --> 00:46:13,646
- [Cheshire grunts]
- [Catwoman] Uh-oh.

677
00:46:18,025 --> 00:46:19,401
[Nosferata screams]

678
00:46:20,402 --> 00:46:21,987
[Batwoman straining]

679
00:46:23,197 --> 00:46:24,448
[Catwoman grunts]

680
00:46:26,116 --> 00:46:31,413
[straining] Let go.
You're too heavy.

681
00:46:31,538 --> 00:46:33,123
Uh, rude.

682
00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:37,336
Still, it never hurts
to lose the extra weight.

683
00:46:37,753 --> 00:46:41,548
- Don't [grunts] do [grunts]...
- Aw, we're halfway down already.

684
00:46:41,715 --> 00:46:43,092
[Cheshire screams]

685
00:46:44,218 --> 00:46:45,594
[Cheshire screams]

686
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:53,686
[grunts wearily]

687
00:46:54,728 --> 00:46:57,606
Still too heavy.

688
00:46:57,898 --> 00:46:59,024
[Nosferata straining]

689
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:00,734
Still so rude.

690
00:47:01,110 --> 00:47:03,028
Hey, we're going to need something
to break our fall.

691
00:47:03,153 --> 00:47:05,197
- [Nosferata straining]
- Oh, what about her?

692
00:47:05,948 --> 00:47:06,991
That'll work.

693
00:47:08,325 --> 00:47:11,996
[straining]

694
00:47:12,413 --> 00:47:13,247
[grunts]

695
00:47:15,165 --> 00:47:16,959
- [Catwoman grunts]
- [Nosferata] No!

696
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:20,045
You're gonna get us all killed.

697
00:47:20,379 --> 00:47:22,673
I'm sure we'll be fine.

698
00:47:22,756 --> 00:47:24,550
And you'll only be badly injured.

699
00:47:25,426 --> 00:47:28,637
[screams in terror]

700
00:47:31,724 --> 00:47:36,687
[screaming, gasping wearily]

701
00:47:36,895 --> 00:47:38,564
[all grunting in pain]

702
00:47:39,106 --> 00:47:41,066
- [Catwoman] Ow!
- [Batwoman] Yeah.

703
00:47:42,192 --> 00:47:43,152
[man clears throat]

704
00:47:43,235 --> 00:47:44,570
Uh-oh, again.

705
00:47:44,653 --> 00:47:46,530
[sighs angrily] What now?

706
00:48:01,962 --> 00:48:04,465
See that? We took out
your two assassins,

707
00:48:04,590 --> 00:48:08,052
so you big-talking, behind-the-scenes
desk jockeys might want to run.

708
00:48:08,218 --> 00:48:11,680
It seems to me the marble floor
took out my assassins.

709
00:48:14,558 --> 00:48:17,061
And we have resources of our own.

710
00:48:17,853 --> 00:48:19,938
[Black Mask] None of us
got here by accident.

711
00:48:20,606 --> 00:48:22,274
[Catwoman scoffs] Speak for yourself.

712
00:48:22,357 --> 00:48:23,776
I just fell through a skylight.

713
00:48:25,944 --> 00:48:26,987
[Black Mask] Kill them both.

714
00:48:27,237 --> 00:48:29,531
- [guns cocking]
- Uh, we should...

715
00:48:29,615 --> 00:48:30,532
Way ahead of you.

716
00:48:32,326 --> 00:48:34,244
[man grunting]

717
00:48:35,871 --> 00:48:38,665
I meant move away from
the guys with guns,

718
00:48:38,832 --> 00:48:40,000
not toward them.

719
00:48:40,125 --> 00:48:41,251
Not my style.

720
00:48:41,335 --> 00:48:44,129
Okay, fine, but if you die,
do I still get my deal?

721
00:48:44,213 --> 00:48:45,923

00:50:05,794 --> 00:50:08,255
Morax serve La Dama.

740
00:50:08,881 --> 00:50:13,260

Did you sign up for this?

00:50:25,731 --> 00:50:28,984
- Uh...
- You really have to think about that?

747
00:50:29,818 --> 00:50:32,154
I definitely did not sign up for this.

748
00:50:32,404 --> 00:50:33,780

Listen to me, <i>gaijin.</i>

Mm, yeah, that is something.

764
00:51:38,011 --> 00:51:43,183
The only problem is, you face

by the great Lady Shiva herself.

That's the problem with demons.

794

The major ones are too hard to control,

795
00:53:25,535 --> 00:53:27,662

I thought you said it was extortion.

862
00:57:27,861 --> 00:57:29,112
No, no, now.

863
00:57:29,195 --> 00:57:31,364

can I have the emerald back now?

- But this pretty will do for now.
- [meows]

882

Right.

get Leviathan to quit

to kill us.

Well, well.

00:58:44,229 --> 00:58:48,066
You know, Isis, Cheshire's sword
really has come in handy.

888

We must remember to thank her
next time we see her.

889
00:58:51,486 --> 00:58:53,697
Assuming she's not still
trying to murder us.

890
00:58:57,117 --> 00:58:58,118
Oh, come on.

891
00:58:58,284 --> 00:58:59,577
Overkill much?

Oh, darn, I was only prepared for 51.

896
00:59:11,548 --> 00:59:12,924
Can you handle the extra?

897
00:59:13,383 --> 00:59:15,301
Please, I'm so getting more than you.

00:59:22,684 --> 00:59:24,728
So why you here? Three.

901
00:59:26,146 --> 00:59:27,021
- [groans]
- One.

902
00:59:27,105 --> 00:59:28,898
I had a feeling this wasn't over. Two.

903
00:59:28,982 --> 00:59:30,525
Minerva's not known for forgiveness.

904
00:59:30,608 --> 00:59:31,568
Three.

905
00:59:33,069 --> 00:59:33,945
[Catwoman] Four.

906
00:59:34,028 --> 00:59:35,989
Oh, why won't you just admit? Five!

907
00:59:36,656 --> 00:59:39,367
Six! That you find me irresistible.

908
00:59:40,243 --> 00:59:41,536
Irresistible?

909
00:59:41,619 --> 00:59:42,537
Come on.

910
00:59:42,620 --> 00:59:44,622
Four. Why won't you just admit... Five.

911
00:59:44,831 --> 00:59:46,374
But personalities aside... Six.

912
00:59:46,458 --> 00:59:48,084
...I have a responsibility... Seven.

913
00:59:48,168 --> 00:59:49,794
...to make sure you survive. Eight.

914
00:59:49,961 --> 00:59:52,130
Oh. At least I have a personality.

915
00:59:52,505 --> 00:59:53,381
Seven, eight.

916
00:59:53,506 --> 00:59:54,507
Nine. Ten.

917
00:59:55,175 --> 00:59:56,301
You're falling behind.

918
00:59:56,634 --> 00:59:57,886
- [Catwoman] Eleven.
- [grunts]

919
01:00:00,305 --> 01:00:02,140
- [Batwoman] Nine, ten.
- [ninjas scream]

920
01:00:02,265 --> 01:00:03,349
[Batwoman] Eleven.

921
01:00:05,268 --> 01:00:07,729
Twelve, 13, 14.

922
01:00:09,230 --> 01:00:10,690
You'll never beat me at this rate.

923
01:00:10,774 --> 01:00:12,275
- Fifteen.
- [groans]

924
01:00:12,358 --> 01:00:13,818
- Twelve.
- [groans]

925
01:00:13,902 --> 01:00:14,819
Thirteen.

926
01:00:15,487 --> 01:00:16,654
- Fourteen.
- [groans]

927
01:00:17,697 --> 01:00:18,656
Fifteen.

928
01:00:19,449 --> 01:00:20,366
[meows]

929
01:00:25,163 --> 01:00:26,498
- [screams]
- [both] He's mine!

930
01:00:28,249 --> 01:00:29,709
[both grunting]

931
01:00:30,835 --> 01:00:32,212
- [grunts]
- [both] Sixteen.

932
01:00:34,005 --> 01:00:38,301
[Catwoman] Ah, final count.
Batwoman: 25.

933
01:00:38,676 --> 01:00:40,386
Catwoman: 27.

934
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:42,013
I win.

935
01:00:42,472 --> 01:00:43,640
Oh, come on.

936
01:00:43,723 --> 01:00:46,142
Seriously? Isis took out two of yours,

937
01:00:46,309 --> 01:00:47,769
so, technically, it's a tie.

938
01:00:48,853 --> 01:00:50,438
- My cat, my count.
- [meows]

939
01:00:51,523 --> 01:00:52,690
[helicopter hovering]

940
01:00:56,820 --> 01:00:58,446
I don't want to say I told you so,

941
01:00:58,530 --> 01:01:02,242
but I believe I told you
52 would not be enough.

942
01:01:02,826 --> 01:01:06,496
My friend, they simply
do not make ninja like they used to.

943
01:01:08,122 --> 01:01:09,123
Deliver the package.

944
01:01:15,088 --> 01:01:15,964
[grunting]

945
01:01:19,384 --> 01:01:20,677
You clearly cheated.

946
01:01:20,927 --> 01:01:24,013
Just because you don't have
a cat of your own to help fight.

947
01:01:25,139 --> 01:01:26,015
[both grunting]

948
01:01:28,852 --> 01:01:30,395
[low growl]

949
01:01:31,646 --> 01:01:34,107
Solomon Grundy.

950
01:01:34,607 --> 01:01:36,818
- Born on a Monday.
- [feet thumping]

951
01:01:37,819 --> 01:01:39,612
- Oh, come on.
- [meows]

952
01:01:40,029 --> 01:01:42,699
Christened on Tuesday.

953
01:01:43,950 --> 01:01:46,870
Married on Wednesday.

954
01:01:47,787 --> 01:01:49,205
[meows]

955
01:01:49,622 --> 01:01:52,083
Wow. That's one fair-weather cat.

956
01:01:52,208 --> 01:01:54,210
Meaning she's smarter than we are?

957
01:01:54,627 --> 01:01:56,170
Yeah, pretty much.

958
01:01:56,754 --> 01:01:59,465
Died on Saturday.

959
01:02:00,300 --> 01:02:02,969
Buried on Sunday.

960
01:02:04,554 --> 01:02:10,101
And that was the end of Solomon Grundy.

961
01:02:12,353 --> 01:02:13,563
[groans]

962
01:02:15,315 --> 01:02:17,609
- Born on a Monday.
- [gasps]

963
01:02:18,401 --> 01:02:21,446
- Christened on Tuesday.
- [grunts]

964
01:02:21,529 --> 01:02:24,741
Married on Wednesday.

965
01:02:26,326 --> 01:02:28,244
Oh, sorry, Sol.

966
01:02:28,328 --> 01:02:29,579
You got the wrong bride.

967
01:02:30,622 --> 01:02:31,581
[grunts]

968
01:02:34,626 --> 01:02:35,501
[grunts]

969
01:02:36,628 --> 01:02:37,712
[groans]

970
01:02:39,213 --> 01:02:41,925
Died on Saturday.

971
01:02:46,220 --> 01:02:49,140
Buried on Sunday.

972
01:02:49,349 --> 01:02:55,396
And that was the end of Solomon Grundy.

973
01:02:56,230 --> 01:02:57,148
If only.

974
01:02:57,565 --> 01:02:59,567
Come on, Sol baby.

975
01:02:59,651 --> 01:03:02,195
I'm the one they sent you to pulverize.

976
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:03,529
Follow me.

977
01:03:03,613 --> 01:03:06,491
Solomon Grundy.

978
01:03:06,658 --> 01:03:09,661
Born on a Monday.

979
01:03:09,786 --> 01:03:11,746
Yes, that's it.

980
01:03:12,121 --> 01:03:13,164
That's it.

981
01:03:13,498 --> 01:03:14,666
Right this way.

982
01:03:14,874 --> 01:03:16,167
There you go.

983
01:03:16,876 --> 01:03:20,046
Christened on Tuesday.

984
01:03:28,388 --> 01:03:31,432
Died on Saturday.

985
01:03:32,308 --> 01:03:33,434
Uh. Look...

986
01:03:33,518 --> 01:03:35,979
I promised a certain someone
that I wouldn't Kill

987
01:03:36,062 --> 01:03:39,357
or not be the direct cause
of death anyway.

988
01:03:39,816 --> 01:03:42,986
But the truly special thing
about you is...

989
01:03:43,444 --> 01:03:45,488
you never permanently kick the bucket.

990
01:03:45,613 --> 01:03:48,491
Solomon Grundy.

991
01:03:48,700 --> 01:03:50,326
- Born on a Monday.
- Yeah, exactly.

992
01:03:50,410 --> 01:03:52,036
Come Monday, you'll just regenerate.

993
01:03:52,203 --> 01:03:54,539
So, when it comes to my promise...

994
01:03:55,248 --> 01:03:56,499
...all bets are off.

995
01:03:56,708 --> 01:04:00,169
Married on Wednesday.

996
01:04:00,503 --> 01:04:03,631
Oh. You're getting married?
Congratulations.

997
01:04:03,756 --> 01:04:05,008
Here. Have a cigar.

998
01:04:05,758 --> 01:04:07,885
Took ill on...

999
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:09,929
Or have a dozen.

1000
01:04:15,143 --> 01:04:16,769
That's all, folks.

1001
01:04:23,109 --> 01:04:24,569
[grunting]

1002
01:04:25,945 --> 01:04:27,071
[sighs]

1003
01:04:32,785 --> 01:04:33,828
[coughs]

1004
01:04:35,329 --> 01:04:36,414
You know what they say.

1005
01:04:36,539 --> 01:04:39,042
[coughs] The bigger
they are... etcetera.

1006
01:04:41,294 --> 01:04:45,256
[sighs] If you want something
done right, etcetera, etcetera.

1007
01:04:49,761 --> 01:04:52,889
Careful. That kitty has claws.

1008
01:04:54,348 --> 01:04:55,266
[hisses]

1009
01:05:00,063 --> 01:05:01,731
So does this one.

1010
01:05:02,690 --> 01:05:03,775
[groans]

1011
01:05:06,694 --> 01:05:07,820
[screams]

1012
01:05:22,376 --> 01:05:25,296
Okay. Did not know you could do that.

1013
01:05:25,671 --> 01:05:26,839
[Cheetah] Yes.

1014
01:05:26,923 --> 01:05:30,384
It came as quite a shock
to Wonder Woman as well.

1015
01:05:31,052 --> 01:05:33,763
But neither of you
should have been surprised.

1016
01:05:33,971 --> 01:05:36,057
I rose to lead Leviathan

1017
01:05:36,140 --> 01:05:39,143
by serving the Gods of both my parents.

1018
01:05:39,393 --> 01:05:41,896
My father's God was
always money, of course.

1019
01:05:41,979 --> 01:05:44,107
My mother's God was Urzkartaga.

1020
01:05:44,273 --> 01:05:47,902
Becoming the cheetah
is Urzkartaga's answer to my prayers.

1021
01:05:48,277 --> 01:05:49,821
[nervously] Uh, right.

1022
01:05:49,904 --> 01:05:52,657
I have a similar deal with, um...

1023
01:05:53,324 --> 01:05:55,368
Bastet, Egyptian Goddess.

1024
01:05:55,618 --> 01:05:59,288
Turns me into a literal Catwoman
all the time.

1025
01:05:59,455 --> 01:06:01,332
Yeah. How do you think I got the name?

1026
01:06:01,457 --> 01:06:02,792
You were a cat burglar

1027
01:06:02,917 --> 01:06:06,129
who started wearing a mask
with cute little kitten ears.

1028
01:06:06,712 --> 01:06:07,755
Yeah.

1029
01:06:07,839 --> 01:06:09,382
They are pretty cute, aren't they?

1030
01:06:09,590 --> 01:06:13,052
Listen, that transformation
of yours seemed really painful.

1031
01:06:13,136 --> 01:06:15,471
And, honestly, I'm pretty exhausted
just from watching it.

1032
01:06:15,555 --> 01:06:18,391
How about we put this off
until, oh, I don't know...

1033
01:06:18,766 --> 01:06:19,809
Bastille Day?

1034
01:06:19,892 --> 01:06:21,102
Bastille Day work for you?

1035
01:06:21,769 --> 01:06:23,813
My schedule is clear now.

1036
01:06:24,105 --> 01:06:25,356
Oh!

1037
01:06:25,439 --> 01:06:26,399
Cat fight?

1038
01:06:26,774 --> 01:06:28,359
Big cat fight.

1039
01:06:29,110 --> 01:06:30,027

Oh, by the way,

1067
01:10:47,410 --> 01:10:50,496
your little problem in Sochi,
that was me.

1068
01:10:50,663 --> 01:10:51,664
You're welcome.

01:11:39,712 --> 01:11:40,671
Selina.

1075
01:11:41,755 --> 01:11:43,799
[groans] Nice catch, Bat.

1076
01:11:45,801 --> 01:11:46,719
No problem.

1077
01:11:59,398 --> 01:12:00,441
[thunder rumbling]

1078
01:12:11,785 --> 01:12:13,329
[groans] Well,

1079
01:12:13,412 --> 01:12:16,290
I suppose a Leviathan
will need a new proxy.

1080
01:12:16,957 --> 01:12:21,879
If Talia Al Ghul is to continue
leading from the shadows.

1081
01:12:22,296 --> 01:12:23,422
But I must say,

1082
01:12:23,714 --> 01:12:27,593
this gives me yet another reason
to hate Selina Kyle.

1083
01:12:27,843 --> 01:12:30,763
As if I hadn't enough reasons already.

1084
01:12:34,225 --> 01:12:35,684
[man] Inhibitor collar set.

1085
01:12:40,606 --> 01:12:41,482
[Batwoman] Hey, hold up.

1086
01:12:41,565 --> 01:12:43,192
Got to put a collar on Grundy.

1087
01:12:43,359 --> 01:12:45,694
How? The guy's got no neck.

1088
01:12:47,613 --> 01:12:48,656
Well, it's over.

1089
01:12:48,781 --> 01:12:51,492
Leviathan and its cartels
have been decimated.

1090
01:12:52,117 --> 01:12:54,036
- And now their leader...
- [Catwoman scoffs] Please.

1091
01:12:54,161 --> 01:12:57,915
You don't really think Cheetah was
the true leader of Leviathan, do you?

1092
01:12:58,165 --> 01:12:59,375
[groans]

1093
01:12:59,708 --> 01:13:00,751
Hold still.

1094
01:13:00,834 --> 01:13:02,169
[Catwoman] You're enjoying this.

1095
01:13:02,253 --> 01:13:03,546
Less than you think.

1096
01:13:04,463 --> 01:13:06,382
- [under breath] But more than I should.
- Hold on.

1097
01:13:06,882 --> 01:13:09,552
If Minerva wasn't
Leviathan's leader, who is?

1098
01:13:09,677 --> 01:13:11,387
Um... I don't know.

1099
01:13:11,512 --> 01:13:13,514
Maybe someone
with international resources

1100
01:13:13,597 --> 01:13:16,016
who's been trained from birth
to rule the underworld?

1101
01:13:16,267 --> 01:13:19,061
- Harley Quinn.
- [groans] I'm out of here.

1102
01:13:19,144 --> 01:13:20,854
All right, Selina, you can go.

1103
01:13:21,605 --> 01:13:23,190
And, hey, thank you.

1104
01:13:23,274 --> 01:13:25,317
Turns out it was our lucky break
you stole that emerald.

1105
01:13:25,943 --> 01:13:27,611
Luck? [scoffs]

1106
01:13:28,279 --> 01:13:30,114
You believe this was all dumb luck?

1107
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:33,534
What makes you think
this wasn't my plan all along?

1108
01:13:33,659 --> 01:13:35,119
[chuckles] Yeah, right.

1109
01:13:35,244 --> 01:13:38,539
Since when does Catwoman care
about taking down criminals?

1110
01:13:39,456 --> 01:13:42,876
Minerva was trafficking human beings,

1111
01:13:43,419 --> 01:13:45,170
young girls.

1112
01:13:48,173 --> 01:13:49,133
[Isis meows]

1113
01:13:52,177 --> 01:13:55,264
Batwoman. Faraday.
The safe in Penguin's plane...

1114
01:13:55,431 --> 01:13:57,308
It's empty.
The cat's eye emerald is gone.

1115
01:13:59,226 --> 01:14:00,436
How did she...

1116
01:14:00,853 --> 01:14:02,438
I have no idea.

1117
01:14:03,314 --> 01:14:05,691
[Julia] Um, where's Catwoman?

1118
01:14:11,614 --> 01:14:13,991
[Catwoman laughs] Luck, my perfect ass.

1119
01:14:14,658 --> 01:14:18,245
Mad skills, baby.
Planning and mad skills.

1120
01:14:19,622 --> 01:14:21,457
[clicks tongue] Isis.

1121
01:14:21,624 --> 01:14:23,167
You shouldn't wander off like that.

1122
01:14:23,417 --> 01:14:26,587
Or do you want to be quarantined
for months after we make landfall?

1123
01:14:27,296 --> 01:14:28,547
[cell phone rings]

1124
01:14:30,341 --> 01:14:32,009
Hi, Holly. How's Anya?

1125
01:14:33,719 --> 01:14:34,720
Well, don't worry.

1126
01:14:35,429 --> 01:14:38,807
We have all the money we need
to get Anya the help she'll need.

1127
01:14:39,308 --> 01:14:42,269
Help for Anya, and help
for all the women and girls

1128
01:14:42,353 --> 01:14:44,271
Leviathan was trafficking in Sochi.

1129
01:14:46,690 --> 01:14:48,817
Back to Gotham? Soon.

1130
01:14:49,151 --> 01:14:50,027
Soon.

1131
01:14:50,402 --> 01:14:52,321
I just have to make
a quick stop in London.

1132
01:14:52,738 --> 01:14:54,615
There are a few things
I need to pick up,

1133
01:14:55,699 --> 01:14:57,701
you know, at the Tower.

1134
01:15:03,749 --> 01:15:05,751
[Japanese song playing]
