1
00:00:22,822 --> 00:00:26,258
<i>In the name of the Father, and</i>
<i>of the Son, and of the Holy Splrit.</i>

2
00:00:26,459 --> 00:00:29,360
My sisters and brothers,
the Lord be with you.

3
00:02:15,735 --> 00:02:18,169
What took you so long?

4
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:28,880
They're going to put me in that
baby room, all the kids screaming.

5
00:02:29,082 --> 00:02:33,416
- I told them you're sick. Don't you...
- No, frankly, no. I don't.

6
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:37,351
Don't you see they realize you're
sick every time he's an alter boy?

7
00:02:37,757 --> 00:02:41,215
- It 's the middle of the week.
- He says it 's Lent.

8
00:02:41,427 --> 00:02:43,861
We're Greek-Orthodox, Spike!

9
00:02:44,531 --> 00:02:47,557
It 's all the same thing.
He's happy, it 's Jesus, who cares?

10
00:02:47,767 --> 00:02:50,565
- So now we're Catholic?
- Let him be a Catholic!

11
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:53,500
- I don't get that!
- It wouldn't kill you...

12
00:02:53,706 --> 00:02:55,537
Why do I have to go to
somebody else's church for?

13
00:02:55,742 --> 00:02:59,872
Because he wants to go to somebody
else's church? Why don't you two go?

14
00:03:08,454 --> 00:03:12,948
Your mother and me are worried.
The way you've been acting lately.

15
00:03:13,393 --> 00:03:16,191
Is there something wrong
that we don't know about?

16
00:03:17,931 --> 00:03:21,697
Those shoes you got, they're weird.
That makes you walk funny.

17
00:03:22,835 --> 00:03:25,360
Why don't you act like other kids?

18
00:03:54,534 --> 00:03:57,367
"Szechuan".

19
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:03,137
In China, it 's "Szechuan"...

20
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:07,479
and, next week...

21
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:14,347
we're going to go to
a"Szechuan" restaurant...

22
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:22,155
on a class excursion,
just before the end of the year.

23
00:04:22,495 --> 00:04:27,558
Also before the end of the year,
our young man...

24
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:33,535
who's on the exchange program
with a Catholic school in London...

25
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:36,005
he's a mister...

26
00:04:36,542 --> 00:04:40,808
Dobbs, you old slag, and it 's
Manchester. It 's a different city.

27
00:04:41,014 --> 00:04:42,709
Mr. Dobbs, please!

28
00:04:42,915 --> 00:04:47,818
You're going to march down to Sister
Michael-Stevens office this minute.

29
00:04:48,054 --> 00:04:51,546
The insolence!
Stop smiling at him, Pauly.

30
00:04:58,231 --> 00:05:02,463
Can I sit here? You didn't call me
back the other night. What 's that?

31
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:07,872
Can I share your menu?

32
00:05:23,723 --> 00:05:27,682
- He's joining basketball.
- He's got guitar lessons that night.

33
00:05:29,095 --> 00:05:32,360
He'll just have to stop
guitar lessons for the season.

34
00:05:32,765 --> 00:05:35,563
No harm, community basketball.

35
00:05:38,638 --> 00:05:41,300
There's something
going on that 's funny.

36
00:05:46,112 --> 00:05:48,137
Basketball.

37
00:06:13,306 --> 00:06:15,035
You've got to...

38
00:06:17,643 --> 00:06:21,409
transfer to public school
for senior year.

39
00:06:33,693 --> 00:06:35,991
Make them let you.

40
00:06:58,284 --> 00:07:00,514
She can't hear.

41
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,228
Your father has an announcement.

42
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:15,633
There'll be no more guitar lessons.
You'll join community basketball.

43
00:07:16,202 --> 00:07:18,363
I'm transfering to public school.

44
00:07:19,071 --> 00:07:23,770
We'll think about that. We let you
transfer to Catholic school...

45
00:07:23,976 --> 00:07:27,036
but you can't keep
flipping back and forth...

46
00:07:27,647 --> 00:07:30,741
even though we aren't Catholic.

47
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:35,987
- So in the mean time...
- Join the team and see if you like.

48
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:39,550
For senior year,
either I transfer or I quit!

49
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:44,128
We'll talk about the other stuff,
public school, that 's later.

50
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:50,528
You haven't tried basketball.
You should try things, okay?

51
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:59,401
What do you think?

52
00:09:19,358 --> 00:09:20,950
Dinner!

53
00:09:25,998 --> 00:09:28,933
He'll be all right
once he's in the game.

54
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:36,204
I've got another boy
but he's an infant.

55
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:40,743
Pauly's just...
He'll get the hang.

56
00:09:45,184 --> 00:09:47,482
You know, I was All-County.

57
00:09:49,388 --> 00:09:50,980
Come on!

58
00:09:52,024 --> 00:09:56,927
Sure you don't mind not playing?
Because you're still on the team.

59
00:09:57,129 --> 00:09:58,926
- You're still considered.
- Hey, you guys!

60
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,394
Come on! Quit the hyjinks!

61
00:10:50,716 --> 00:10:53,378
The chords sometimes,
you know...

62
00:11:22,148 --> 00:11:25,083
I'm not as old as I look.

63
00:11:33,893 --> 00:11:36,919
I think I'm getting married.

64
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:40,855
To Jesus?

65
00:11:42,835 --> 00:11:45,429
I've missed things.

66
00:11:47,173 --> 00:11:52,042
I don't want to miss anything, ever.
There's so much.

67
00:11:53,646 --> 00:11:57,480
I want everything, all at once,
I don't care.

68
00:11:57,683 --> 00:12:03,781
Color! Freedom!
Other things...

69
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:26,037
- You're transferring.
- Your father and I... talked.

70
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:52,700
You can't dress like that.

71
00:12:58,477 --> 00:13:02,243
Come over to my house,
after school.

72
00:13:17,396 --> 00:13:21,799
That 's Marta, the student body.
She says she's a virgin...

73
00:13:22,001 --> 00:13:26,734
but I know at least two guys she blew
in the ninth grade at the quarry.

74
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:37,043
Guess what! I transferred! Same as
you. I'm supposed to join clubs now.

75
00:13:37,249 --> 00:13:40,150
What 'd you join? I'm definitely
joining Theater Guild!

76
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:49,125
Where did you get that shirt?

77
00:13:50,095 --> 00:13:52,859
Okay, I hate you now.

78
00:14:04,944 --> 00:14:08,436
You should try for something guys
try for, like sports or something.

79
00:14:08,647 --> 00:14:13,880
If you're new here and you're a
theater fag, that 's death. Forget it.

80
00:14:19,258 --> 00:14:21,158
I transferred last year...

81
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:25,357
and now I'm really,
really popular.

82
00:14:35,741 --> 00:14:40,906
They let anyone on the team, the
team's for shit. And you never play.

83
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:43,841
Then you get invited
to all the parties, right?

84
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:47,883
And all the girls on the teams
date the guys on the teams.

85
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:57,151
The drum major just quit! His mother
had a nervous breakdown...

86
00:14:57,363 --> 00:15:00,924
at somewhere. And we'll be totally
fucked in competition next month!

87
00:15:01,133 --> 00:15:03,693
Fucked, do you hear me?
Fucked, fucked, fucked!

88
00:15:31,864 --> 00:15:34,355
You'll hear on Monday.

89
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:45,668
The only way you can get away with
being drum major, if you get it...

90
00:15:45,878 --> 00:15:50,338
is by being on some other team.
Drum major by itself is too queerbo!

91
00:16:04,396 --> 00:16:06,887
- I have new friends now, Colin.
- I don't care.

92
00:16:07,433 --> 00:16:11,631
- I'm only auditioning for credit.
- All you have to do is sing a song.

93
00:16:11,837 --> 00:16:15,170
- They need 3O people for the chorus.
- A song?

94
00:16:15,374 --> 00:16:18,571
- He makes you sing with sheet music.
- Who?

95
00:16:19,178 --> 00:16:20,975
That guy.

96
00:16:21,347 --> 00:16:24,510
Just, please, just... Noel.

97
00:16:24,717 --> 00:16:30,485
No "mister". If you say Mr. Somebody
you imply certain hierarchical...

98
00:16:32,424 --> 00:16:36,451
Those of you just getting here,
I'm a student teacher.

99
00:16:36,895 --> 00:16:41,332
I'm in school myself.
Sophomore, college.

100
00:16:41,533 --> 00:16:45,469
I'll be directing
my own adaptation of...

101
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:49,300
Nathaniel Hawthorne's novel,
"The Scarlet Letter".

102
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:52,443
It 'll be called "A".

103
00:16:55,881 --> 00:16:59,180
Which is really great, great
Hawthorne. Hawthorne wrote it.

104
00:16:59,385 --> 00:17:02,843
He was a great social critic.

105
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:06,689
And we'll be doing
a musical theater version.

106
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:13,290
Okay, so, are there any questions
before we begin?

107
00:17:15,567 --> 00:17:17,330
So we can just begin.

108
00:17:19,671 --> 00:17:22,265
Marta? Marta Walburg.

109
00:17:26,845 --> 00:17:30,713
Hi, Marta. I'm Noel, I'm a student
teacher, I'm directing "A".

110
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:33,180
- The spring play, yeah.
- Thanks.

111
00:17:33,452 --> 00:17:36,819
I'm auditioning for Hester,
the lead.

112
00:17:37,022 --> 00:17:40,219
Great. Whenever you're ready.

113
00:17:40,426 --> 00:17:44,624
I'm not looking for...
You don't have to...

114
00:17:45,697 --> 00:17:47,995
I'm not looking for beatiful voices.

115
00:17:49,034 --> 00:17:52,595
I'm looking for... honesty.

116
00:17:58,544 --> 00:18:00,307
Okay.

117
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:10,652
<i>He touched me</i>

118
00:18:10,856 --> 00:18:15,156
<i>He put hls hand In mlne</i>
<i>And then he touched me</i>

119
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,988
I usually work
professionally.

120
00:18:18,197 --> 00:18:22,566
I think I'm a shoe-in. Because
they need someone impish.

121
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:28,468
And Marta is wrong, because Pearl
is the lead, not Hester.

122
00:18:28,674 --> 00:18:31,404
And I have a really big range.

123
00:18:36,048 --> 00:18:38,642
That was good, Marta.

124
00:18:40,886 --> 00:18:44,652
- I only need 8 bars, so you...
- When are call backs?!

125
00:18:45,023 --> 00:18:50,051
- I can't come back tomorrow!
- Just put that down on your card, OK?

126
00:18:51,029 --> 00:18:52,894
Okay, who's next?

127
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:56,426
Rusty McGee?

128
00:18:58,504 --> 00:19:02,770
You can go after Rusty.
And your name is?

129
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:05,170
I'm ready.

130
00:19:08,113 --> 00:19:12,743
- Colin said we can get credit.
- Can me and him go together?

131
00:19:14,052 --> 00:19:16,953
- That 's Colin.
- Can I just give you my key?

132
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:19,750
Did you tell me what your name is?

133
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:39,304
I know you're gonna get drum major
because Jamey, who was it before...

134
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:42,810
had something really weird about
him that Mr. Fontaine hated...

135
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:46,610
and you completely don't have,
and that 's when you conduct...

136
00:19:46,818 --> 00:19:51,687
your whole body is really in it,
and not just your arms.

137
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:54,188
If it was just your arms, forget it.

138
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:05,966
You forgot to close your locker!

139
00:20:11,176 --> 00:20:13,474
Why do you wanna be in the play?

140
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:20,981
You know, I got muscles where
guys don't even have muscles...

141
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:29,584
When did you get your hair?
Down there, I mean.

142
00:20:30,662 --> 00:20:34,496
Eleven, and chubbers
since I was, like, six.

143
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:41,138
It 's hot down here. Are you hot?
It 's hot lately.

144
00:20:42,474 --> 00:20:44,635
Spring to summer.

145
00:20:45,877 --> 00:20:48,505
- You're not hot?
- No.

146
00:20:51,383 --> 00:20:53,112
A little.

147
00:20:55,487 --> 00:20:58,320
In the summer we belong
to the pool, you wanna come?

148
00:20:59,725 --> 00:21:01,022
Maybe.

149
00:21:01,393 --> 00:21:06,296
You see the girls' nipples when
their suits are wet. Hard and shit.

150
00:21:08,867 --> 00:21:10,664
Feel this muscle.

151
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:24,108
It 's just a play, and this guy
is directing it from college.

152
00:21:24,316 --> 00:21:28,719
And I'll get A.P. credit if I do it,
it won't take away from track...

153
00:21:32,924 --> 00:21:35,791
If you get drum major,
are you gonna take it?

154
00:21:36,428 --> 00:21:38,020
I don't know.

155
00:21:38,664 --> 00:21:41,792
Man, all I think about is pussy.

156
00:21:43,035 --> 00:21:45,503
Don't be in that faggity play.

157
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:49,732
I've got homework.

158
00:21:53,078 --> 00:21:55,342
You don't wanna wrestle?

159
00:22:53,338 --> 00:22:55,238
Where were you?

160
00:22:55,841 --> 00:22:59,004
- Where were you?
- I don't know!

161
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:02,707
Don't be in places you don't know!

162
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:06,039
Do your mother and me that favor!

163
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:15,724
- You auditioned for the spring play?
- It counts for A.P. English.

164
00:23:15,927 --> 00:23:18,987
- Since when?
- Is it warm?

165
00:23:19,197 --> 00:23:23,793
There's a big kegger this weekend.
You gotta show up and bring a date.

166
00:23:24,136 --> 00:23:26,297
It 's really warm.

167
00:23:26,805 --> 00:23:28,500
A.P. credit for real?

168
00:23:29,641 --> 00:23:31,404
The cast list is up! It 's up!

169
00:23:58,303 --> 00:24:00,669
I can be on the stage crew.

170
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:15,113
- Hi.
- Hi.

171
00:24:16,555 --> 00:24:21,151
- I'm on the list.
- Sure, Paul.

172
00:24:23,028 --> 00:24:26,930
Pauly. Or Paul.

173
00:24:29,234 --> 00:24:31,099
Pauly.

174
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:36,972
- I really liked your balad.
- Come on.

175
00:24:37,175 --> 00:24:38,904
No, I did.

176
00:24:39,611 --> 00:24:42,546
The "Our Father" is the only
thing I know that 's slow.

177
00:24:44,182 --> 00:24:45,843
It was...

178
00:24:48,186 --> 00:24:49,813
heartfelt.

179
00:24:52,757 --> 00:24:55,487
But you should really leave
that on the board, though.

180
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:02,925
- Pauly?
- Noel?

181
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:13,069
We need to have
a serious conversation.

182
00:25:16,414 --> 00:25:19,178
You're playing a townsperson, okay?

183
00:25:20,085 --> 00:25:22,849
There's no lines...

184
00:25:23,421 --> 00:25:27,357
but I really wanna try something
unique with the townspeople.

185
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:29,989
Okay.

186
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:36,192
I can paint too.
You know, sets or something.

187
00:25:36,401 --> 00:25:41,498
"A" takes place in colonial America
and most of my work, my painting...

188
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:45,073
has been about colonial America.

189
00:25:54,286 --> 00:25:57,187
Your phone is ringing.

190
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:01,991
I don't like the phone too much.

191
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:25,883
Guard this with your life, Pauly.

192
00:26:27,786 --> 00:26:29,413
- Excuse me.
- Congratulations.

193
00:26:29,621 --> 00:26:32,112
Now I'm willing to work around your
track and theater guild schedule...

194
00:26:32,324 --> 00:26:36,192
but I'm going to ask for a strong
band commitment. Can you give that?

195
00:26:36,394 --> 00:26:40,763
Since I'm the moderator of both,
I'll coordinate schedules with Noel.

196
00:26:40,966 --> 00:26:44,527
I think it 's all going to work out.
After all, you have a small part.

197
00:26:45,003 --> 00:26:48,404
But he wanted to do something
unique with the townspeople!

198
00:26:52,143 --> 00:26:56,477
Oh, my God, really?
Are you for real?

199
00:27:04,055 --> 00:27:06,523
- How's he gonna do the work?
- I'll do the work.

200
00:27:06,725 --> 00:27:09,922
- He'll do the work!
- He's got a band, track, A.V.

201
00:27:10,128 --> 00:27:13,256
- He resigned.
- Resigned from A. V? You just started!

202
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:15,399
- He's an A student.
- I'm an A student.

203
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,364
And now a play?
The school work comes first!

204
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:21,801
- He knows!
- I can do it.

205
00:27:22,507 --> 00:27:25,533
- Is he making friends?
- Well...

206
00:27:27,012 --> 00:27:31,244
- What did you do to your jeans?
- Don't worry about the jeans.

207
00:27:31,449 --> 00:27:32,677
He's a boy,
they rip their jeans.

208
00:27:33,084 --> 00:27:35,018
Hawthorne was a great
romantic as well...

209
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:38,212
and for that to come alive
on stage, visually...

210
00:27:38,423 --> 00:27:42,689
I need to strike a kind
of beautiful balance.

211
00:27:43,828 --> 00:27:45,819
- That sounds so pretentious.
- No.

212
00:27:46,865 --> 00:27:51,859
But they're all pariahs. All of them.
Even Dimmesdale. Even little Pearl.

213
00:27:52,737 --> 00:27:55,297
It 's really about class.

214
00:27:56,141 --> 00:27:59,167
- Maybe.
- Structures, oppression!

215
00:27:59,377 --> 00:28:03,507
- Exactly. Have your read any Marx?
- No. But I've made some sketches.

216
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:16,589
I checked about the A.P. English
credit. It 's for real, don't ask me.

217
00:28:17,295 --> 00:28:19,627
- So why not?
- Forget it!

218
00:28:21,299 --> 00:28:27,534
He wants townspeople of many colors.
And he's right. It 's a metaphor.

219
00:28:28,339 --> 00:28:30,705
Totally forget it.

220
00:28:33,478 --> 00:28:37,244
<i>In 1642</i>
<i>Hester Prynne was In a stew</i>

221
00:28:37,682 --> 00:28:41,743
<i>She was a ne'er-do-well</i>
<i>Calm down, you're a crlmlnal</i>

222
00:28:41,953 --> 00:28:45,480
<i>Dlmmesdale, Chllllngworth and Pearl</i>

223
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:49,091
<i>Found themselves In thls world</i>

224
00:28:49,427 --> 00:28:53,420
<i>Of hell, hell, hell!</i>

225
00:28:57,068 --> 00:29:01,004
<i>"A"Is for adulteress</i>
<i>And archetype, and awe</i>

226
00:29:01,673 --> 00:29:05,973
<i>"A"Is for Antlgone</i>
<i>For anarchy, for angst</i>

227
00:29:06,478 --> 00:29:12,940
<i>"A"é apropos</i>
<i>And every day, In every way</i>

228
00:29:13,151 --> 00:29:17,144
<i>My curse</i>
<i>My Ilfe, my sln!</i>

229
00:29:43,314 --> 00:29:45,145
Is somebody there?

230
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:54,552
I have some more sketches.

231
00:29:58,596 --> 00:30:02,259
That was you?
I remember you in that.

232
00:30:02,534 --> 00:30:06,493
They said I was the best Abraham
Lincoln in the history of the school.

233
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:10,332
I was, like, twelve.
My mom took me.

234
00:30:10,542 --> 00:30:16,572
I was tortured...
as the character.

235
00:30:17,415 --> 00:30:19,542
You were great.

236
00:30:20,718 --> 00:30:24,882
<i>And the rocket's red glare</i>

237
00:30:25,089 --> 00:30:29,048
<i>The bombs burstlng In alr</i>

238
00:30:29,594 --> 00:30:33,428

00:30:34,065 --> 00:30:38,399
<i>That our flagwas stlll there</i>

240
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:45,000
<i>O say, does that star-spangled</i>

<i>Banneryet wave</i>

242
00:30:51,816 --> 00:30:56,810
<i>O'erthe land of the free</i>

243
00:30:58,623 --> 00:31:00,921
It climbs there.

244
00:32:08,526 --> 00:32:10,756
- Where's your hat?
- He just forgot.

245
00:32:10,962 --> 00:32:14,227
- The hat is for them to see you.
- He just forgot it somewhere, okay?

246
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:19,627
The hat, the plume, when you're
down on the, marching in front of...

247
00:32:19,837 --> 00:32:22,931
You have the plume for them to see,
something to look for!

248
00:32:23,141 --> 00:32:25,006
Please, it 's okay, okay?

249
00:32:25,209 --> 00:32:28,303
Or who knows where they're marching!

250
00:32:28,513 --> 00:32:32,779
- Not now, Ludmilla.
- Okay.

251
00:32:33,418 --> 00:32:38,481
Leadership. If this is the foot
we're going to get off on...

252
00:32:42,927 --> 00:32:46,124
Come over tonight, at 8 o'clock.
We can practice, okay?

253
00:32:46,331 --> 00:32:47,855
Sure!

254
00:32:48,232 --> 00:32:52,396
- Where are you going?
- I've got play rehearsal!

255
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:56,740
He's gonna murder you!

256
00:33:04,415 --> 00:33:08,545
You're late! I just gave
a whole talk about lateness...

257
00:33:08,753 --> 00:33:10,880
and people being late!

258
00:33:13,224 --> 00:33:15,089
He said I could be on stage crew!

259
00:33:15,293 --> 00:33:19,195
Okay, everyone who's not in
costume, please stand off stage!

260
00:33:20,198 --> 00:33:24,328
Marta, because you're so naturally
pretty, we're gonna costume you...

261
00:33:24,535 --> 00:33:26,526
She is not so pretty!

262
00:33:29,307 --> 00:33:32,299
I left my band hat at your house.

263
00:33:44,622 --> 00:33:47,420
- Why hold your cigarette like that?
- What?

264
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:51,160
Guys go like this
and girls hold like this.

265
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:56,864
I'll bring your hat by at 6
and then we need to talk.

266
00:33:58,536 --> 00:34:03,337
Don't you think there's
something, like, he's weird?

267
00:34:11,249 --> 00:34:16,585
There's one last kegger for the year.
Go or you're sunk in everyone's eyes.

268
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:27,895
- Where are my socks?
- What? In your drawer.

269
00:34:28,099 --> 00:34:31,091
- The ones with the elastic!
- Your dress socks? What?

270
00:34:31,302 --> 00:34:36,467
- The white tube socks that stay up!
- I don't know. What 's the problem?

271
00:34:36,674 --> 00:34:38,699
Why can't we afford better socks?

272
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:41,845
We send you to public school, that 's
supposed to be the end of the problem!

273
00:34:42,046 --> 00:34:44,571
Everybody has better
socks than we do!

274
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:50,179
All the socks in the house are very,
very fine enough for most people.

275
00:34:57,829 --> 00:35:00,320
There's a boy at the front door!

276
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:07,000
This is my brother's car,
he just let me drive it.

277
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:13,004
It 's for girls. It 's, you know,
a fuck truck, or something.

278
00:35:15,213 --> 00:35:17,773
They are always
on me and they...

279
00:35:18,983 --> 00:35:24,751
My parents fight and I think, "Why
would anybody want...", you know?

280
00:35:26,357 --> 00:35:29,952
They fight when he drinks. Dad.

281
00:35:31,195 --> 00:35:35,495
She drinks too.
We all drink. A little bit.

282
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:38,197
I blow up sometimes.

283
00:35:39,937 --> 00:35:44,067
Today I thought everything was bad.

284
00:35:44,709 --> 00:35:50,978
For about three hours, everything
just wasn't so good in my head.

285
00:35:52,383 --> 00:35:54,044
Pauly?

286
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:59,252
- I know different types of people...
- I'm sure.

287
00:36:00,391 --> 00:36:02,188
I bet.

288
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:05,160
...and you're certainly
one of the most talented.

289
00:36:14,472 --> 00:36:17,464
My hat is at your house.

290
00:36:23,614 --> 00:36:25,946
He's making friends.

291
00:36:27,084 --> 00:36:30,110
I don't care what he does,
as long as the grades are up.

292
00:36:30,821 --> 00:36:36,282
- A boy came by tonight.
- At his age I did all kinds of things.

293
00:36:36,761 --> 00:36:40,162
- With big, sad eyes.
- But I kept the grades up.

294
00:36:43,601 --> 00:36:45,626
Sad eyes?

295
00:36:54,145 --> 00:36:58,081
- It was hot today.
- I'll get your hat.

296
00:37:01,319 --> 00:37:06,086
Spring or something. It 's only
March and it 's really warm.

297
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:08,582
There's the pool.

298
00:37:10,861 --> 00:37:13,329
I'll get your hat.

299
00:37:22,306 --> 00:37:24,103
- I can't.
- What?

300
00:37:24,308 --> 00:37:26,674
I can't do "A".

301
00:37:26,877 --> 00:37:31,211
I've reduced the complexities
of the novel into boulevard clichés.

302
00:37:34,285 --> 00:37:38,984
What if we take the townspeople
in a kind of Meyerhold direction?

303
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:43,183
Ritualized gestures.
They are all cogs in a system.

304
00:37:50,635 --> 00:37:52,762
Where is everybody?

305
00:37:56,340 --> 00:38:00,401
- It 's quiet.
- For now, it is. They go out.

306
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:06,339
- Your brothers are big.
- I'm the runt.

307
00:38:11,088 --> 00:38:14,455
Your brother's suit is too big.

308
00:38:31,842 --> 00:38:34,504
I like it when it 's 2 a.m.

309
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:38,937
- You're always touching the water.
- I do.

310
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:41,584
You're like a mermaid or something.

311
00:38:43,054 --> 00:38:46,114
2 a.m. is the best time.

312
00:38:46,624 --> 00:38:51,391
- "I've heard the mermaid singing..."
- I like the water.

313
00:38:52,229 --> 00:38:54,823
"...each to each."

314
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:59,727
2 a.m. is... Yeah.

315
00:39:01,972 --> 00:39:06,306
- Your teeth are so straight.
- Braces.

316
00:39:11,082 --> 00:39:13,949
"I don't think they'll sing to me."

317
00:39:18,556 --> 00:39:20,114
T. S. Eliot.

318
00:39:22,893 --> 00:39:26,294
I'm seventeen.

319
00:39:27,932 --> 00:39:29,923
Braces?

320
00:39:48,619 --> 00:39:51,087
You should really
wear a bathing suit.

321
00:39:53,557 --> 00:39:55,718
I know all types of people...

322
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:58,153
You said that once already.

323
00:39:59,964 --> 00:40:02,194
There's something I wanna say.

324
00:40:11,675 --> 00:40:14,200
I really like girls.

325
00:40:20,151 --> 00:40:21,743
Okay.

326
00:40:40,838 --> 00:40:43,363
I hate that freaking play!

327
00:40:50,181 --> 00:40:55,118
You missed the last kegger. Forget
about any reputation you could have!

328
00:41:24,448 --> 00:41:28,043
- Where do you think he is?
- Practice.

329
00:41:28,652 --> 00:41:31,485
Second night this week this late.

330
00:41:32,656 --> 00:41:36,285
Practice?
What are you talking about?

331
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:38,928
At midnight, what do you think
a teenager is practicing?

332
00:41:40,831 --> 00:41:44,392
Track? How do I know?
What do you want from me?

333
00:41:44,602 --> 00:41:48,561
- Be concerned. Is that too much?
- Read your book.

334
00:41:55,379 --> 00:41:58,610
Your weird son is out there doing
God knows what!

335
00:42:00,417 --> 00:42:03,545
He's your weird son, too.

336
00:42:07,057 --> 00:42:08,922
Noel?

337
00:42:09,627 --> 00:42:11,720
Oh, my God.

338
00:42:12,096 --> 00:42:14,656
What are you doing?

339
00:42:15,432 --> 00:42:18,424
- Out in the middle...
- Guy, this is...

340
00:42:18,636 --> 00:42:20,934
- I mean, where are we?
...Pauly.

341
00:42:21,805 --> 00:42:24,797
- Guy. Hi.
- Hi.

342
00:42:27,311 --> 00:42:33,477
My car just broke down, I looked
around and I'm like, "Where am I?"

343
00:42:33,684 --> 00:42:35,618
I'm directing something.

344
00:42:35,819 --> 00:42:38,219
It 's nothing, really. High School.

345
00:42:41,191 --> 00:42:46,595
Well, nobody has seen you in,
like, forever.

346
00:42:47,631 --> 00:42:50,998
Mark is nuts again.

347
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:56,305
Paolo is repainting everything.
Can you imagine?

348
00:42:56,774 --> 00:42:58,298
No.

349
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:04,477
Call me some time.

350
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:10,083
Yeah.

351
00:43:17,328 --> 00:43:20,024
- Who is that?
- Some guy.

352
00:43:20,230 --> 00:43:24,030
- How do you know him?
- I used to work with him at a place.

353
00:43:59,737 --> 00:44:02,171
Where have you been?

354
00:44:02,439 --> 00:44:04,270
Pizza Hut.

355
00:44:05,075 --> 00:44:06,542
The Stack.

356
00:44:07,277 --> 00:44:11,179
- Pizza Hut or The Stack?
- The Stack!

357
00:44:11,448 --> 00:44:13,780
The Stack or Pizza Hut?

358
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:17,549
The Stack! The Stack.

359
00:44:17,921 --> 00:44:21,721
How old is that boy,
that boy with the big eyes?

360
00:44:24,161 --> 00:44:26,026
My age.

361
00:44:29,933 --> 00:44:35,599
You both should know that Pauly's
commitment to band is sorely lacking.

362
00:44:36,573 --> 00:44:39,064
Go. Stay.

363
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:45,778
I had a close friend
in High School too.

364
00:44:45,983 --> 00:44:48,713
We had a lot in common.
We were on Yearbook Commitee.

365
00:44:48,919 --> 00:44:51,387
Then we became aware
of what other people thought.

366
00:44:51,588 --> 00:44:54,580
And people with nothing better
to think about end up thinking...

367
00:44:54,992 --> 00:44:56,459
things.

368
00:44:56,660 --> 00:44:59,527
I can do set design
and be a drum major, too.

369
00:44:59,730 --> 00:45:02,961
Pauly, Noel is a professional...

370
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:05,830
Sure. I know.

371
00:45:06,036 --> 00:45:08,664
...and I've met his girlfriend.

372
00:45:35,466 --> 00:45:40,096
I might not go to the dorm-dorms,
I might go to the apartment-dorms.

373
00:45:41,038 --> 00:45:42,903
Yes?

374
00:45:43,874 --> 00:45:48,538
You can move in, the apartment-dorms
you don't need ID for.

375
00:45:50,814 --> 00:45:53,783
I'm waiting to hear from colleges.

376
00:45:54,685 --> 00:45:59,349
- Well, whatever.
- I haven't heard.

377
00:45:59,757 --> 00:46:01,782
Whatever, you know?

378
00:46:07,097 --> 00:46:09,657
Who is your girlfriend?

379
00:46:11,001 --> 00:46:12,832
You.

380
00:46:30,788 --> 00:46:33,222
Hands, you know?

381
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:44,993
What?

382
00:46:49,973 --> 00:46:52,771
- Wait.
- What?

383
00:46:54,278 --> 00:46:55,905
Pauly...

384
00:46:57,247 --> 00:46:59,545
come on, give it back.

385
00:47:04,855 --> 00:47:07,050
Take mine.

386
00:47:21,338 --> 00:47:24,034
- I'm almost out!
- Did he say anything?

387
00:47:24,241 --> 00:47:26,300
- What?
- He came into my room before...

388
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:29,411
and Noel is staying over because
he got locked out of his house!

389
00:47:29,613 --> 00:47:33,105
- Wait till I'm out!
- I found no blankets for the floor!

390
00:47:33,450 --> 00:47:38,285
- What are you talking about?
- He might 've thought something.

391
00:47:38,488 --> 00:47:42,754
Your friend got locked out?
Just wait, I'll be out in a minute!

392
00:47:52,202 --> 00:47:54,227
How's the play?

393
00:47:54,705 --> 00:48:00,166
Bet I'll hate it. It 's faggy.
That 's why I quit stage crew.

394
00:48:02,679 --> 00:48:06,445
You're hanging out with Noel.
Everybody thinks that 's weird.

395
00:48:06,917 --> 00:48:11,115
Coach says if I cut my hair,
I'll be more aerodynamic.

396
00:48:14,625 --> 00:48:16,559
You look weird.

397
00:48:17,694 --> 00:48:19,924
I think something's stuck.

398
00:48:34,478 --> 00:48:37,379
Why would a person do such a thing?

399
00:48:37,581 --> 00:48:40,846
Putting rings in places
they don't belong!

400
00:48:41,618 --> 00:48:43,984
What are you?

401
00:48:46,356 --> 00:48:48,551
What are you?

402
00:49:29,099 --> 00:49:31,465
Pauly has his play tonight.

403
00:49:34,571 --> 00:49:37,039
We couldn't get a sitter.

404
00:49:40,911 --> 00:49:45,712
I guess no one likes this casserole.
It was a new recipe.

405
00:49:54,791 --> 00:49:57,919
Your father and I think you're
seeing too much of that boy.

406
00:49:58,128 --> 00:50:02,189
We don't want him around.
Your father and I agree that...

407
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:06,365
- Your ring was red.
- No, it wasn't.

408
00:50:06,570 --> 00:50:10,131
- Your birthstone, it was red!
- It changed.

409
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:12,274
- Who has your ring?
- The girl with the flute.

410
00:50:12,476 --> 00:50:14,171
- No, she doesn't.
- Clarinet!

411
00:50:14,378 --> 00:50:18,246
- Where's your ring?
- Wouldn't you like to know?

412
00:50:18,448 --> 00:50:20,313
- Someone has his ring!
- Wouldn't that make you happy?

413
00:50:20,517 --> 00:50:24,385
- It 's the girl with the flute!
- Clarinet!

414
00:50:24,955 --> 00:50:30,325
It 's a clarinet! Why can't
you get anything right?!

415
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:39,196
I'm gonna have that boy arrested!

416
00:50:39,403 --> 00:50:42,930
I know he's up to no good! Don't
think I don't know what he's up to!

417
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:47,270
You're grounded!
He's grounded.

418

- You still have your eye makeup on.
- So?

430
00:52:18,568 --> 00:52:22,436
- So?
- So what about rock stars?

431
00:52:23,707 --> 00:52:25,902
What are we waiting for?

432
00:52:27,811 --> 00:52:30,609
I better get A.P. credit
for this or you're dead.

433
00:52:33,483 --> 00:52:36,543
We planned a whole thing
for the cast and anybody in...

434
00:52:38,054 --> 00:52:40,318
What do they know?

435
00:52:41,925 --> 00:52:44,519
What does anybody know?

436
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:49,162
Wait a minute.

437
00:52:50,367 --> 00:52:52,232
Oh, my God!

438
00:52:59,142 --> 00:53:03,602
I totally screwed up that part where
we jeer Hester at the stockade.

439
00:53:04,447 --> 00:53:06,847
I know everybody saw it.

440
00:53:07,951 --> 00:53:11,785
It 's just a different interpretation.
What 's wrong with that?

441
00:53:12,522 --> 00:53:14,683
I don't know.

442
00:53:15,592 --> 00:53:19,619
It 's just that... I used to be cute.

443
00:53:19,829 --> 00:53:23,060
And I don't fucking
feel cute anymore!

444
00:53:24,901 --> 00:53:27,369
My voice cracked.

445
00:53:27,804 --> 00:53:31,672
My voice cracked, man. Do you
have any idea what that means?

446
00:53:32,509 --> 00:53:35,342
It 's over.

447
00:53:36,313 --> 00:53:39,510
Now I'm just this
ex-fucking baby face.

448
00:53:40,717 --> 00:53:44,050
You know, we're not
kids anymore, Pauly.

449
00:54:06,042 --> 00:54:08,875
- You could come inside.
- What am I doing?

450
00:54:09,679 --> 00:54:13,843
- Everyone is inside.
- What do I have?

451
00:54:15,652 --> 00:54:19,418
- They didn't get it.
- I'm twenty. What do I have?

452
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:22,615
- Do you know what can happen?
- She wouldn't...

453
00:54:22,826 --> 00:54:25,989
- Mr. Fontaine...
- Everyone thinks they know.

454
00:54:27,063 --> 00:54:29,327
Nobody got it.

455
00:54:30,033 --> 00:54:31,660
Nobody.

456
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:37,934
The scholarship means I have
to concentrate on school.

457
00:54:38,141 --> 00:54:42,874
- Get my head on school.
- They didn't get it!

458
00:54:43,079 --> 00:54:46,480
They think they know,
and who knows?

459
00:54:47,784 --> 00:54:51,049
There's just so much.

460
00:54:51,921 --> 00:54:53,786
Everything.

461
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:59,721
If we just... can just...

462
00:55:07,270 --> 00:55:10,467
It 's Marta, right?

463
00:55:16,746 --> 00:55:22,707
Well, Marta's tits aren't real!
I know and Rusty knows!

464
00:55:23,186 --> 00:55:25,950
Everybody knows but you!

465
00:55:46,710 --> 00:55:49,076
We did the show tonight.

466
00:55:50,814 --> 00:55:53,180
Study group.

467
00:55:57,921 --> 00:56:00,014
They just left.

468
00:56:01,758 --> 00:56:03,851
Do you wanna get some...?

469
00:56:05,095 --> 00:56:08,462
- Go some...?
- No.

470
00:56:15,939 --> 00:56:17,634
No.

471
00:56:46,236 --> 00:56:49,967
Trains, you know, they're always
going somewhere.

472
00:57:28,611 --> 00:57:31,808
- The interstate?
- Your car broke down.

473
00:57:34,217 --> 00:57:38,210
Oh, my God. Right.

474
00:57:40,657 --> 00:57:42,921
Noel says hi.

475
00:57:45,862 --> 00:57:49,593
We'll be moving in together soon...

476
00:57:50,099 --> 00:57:54,763
to his dorm, apartment-dorm,
not a dorm-dorm.

477
00:57:56,606 --> 00:57:59,131
Look, I've gotta meet
some friends...

478
00:58:12,322 --> 00:58:15,587
Well, these are those friends.

479
00:58:56,432 --> 00:59:00,766
It 's not you I hate.
It 's anyone who's been with Noel.

480
00:59:01,204 --> 00:59:04,037
I hate everybody
who's been with Noel.

481
00:59:14,551 --> 00:59:19,545
When you say "with Noel",
you mean, like, what?

482
01:00:54,851 --> 01:00:57,445
I haven't slept in two days!

483
01:01:29,752 --> 01:01:33,552
You know I hated you
when I first met you?

484
01:01:35,958 --> 01:01:38,654
And now I think...

485
01:01:39,195 --> 01:01:40,787
you're kind of...

486
01:01:41,164 --> 01:01:42,995
blond!

487
01:02:26,709 --> 01:02:29,735
I'm so tired...

488
01:02:29,946 --> 01:02:32,847
but my eys still won't shut.

489
01:02:34,917 --> 01:02:37,283
How about that?

490
01:02:40,490 --> 01:02:43,516
He says, why does
anybody get married...

491
01:02:45,862 --> 01:02:48,854
why they stay together, but I know.

492
01:02:50,700 --> 01:02:52,895
I want some day...

493
01:02:53,736 --> 01:02:55,431
everything.

494
01:02:57,240 --> 01:03:00,266
I'm new to the city...

495
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,628
I thought you could read this.

496
01:04:05,308 --> 01:04:11,372
We're going to see a person,
someone... all of us.

497
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:20,751
- Mom?
- Someone who...

498
01:04:20,957 --> 01:04:24,484
deals with... things.
What?

499
01:04:26,295 --> 01:04:28,058
Nothing.

500
01:04:30,333 --> 01:04:32,096
Sleep.

501
01:04:34,170 --> 01:04:38,129
No, no. No, sir.
You get up.

502
01:04:38,608 --> 01:04:42,442
You missed track meet, you're not
going to miss the band competition.

503
01:04:42,778 --> 01:04:44,336
You get up!

504
01:04:55,091 --> 01:04:58,026
Are you aware... are you aware...

505
01:04:58,394 --> 01:05:01,659
You are aware that today
is the band competition?

506
01:05:10,006 --> 01:05:13,965
So you just weren't going
to call me? That 's...

507
01:05:15,278 --> 01:05:17,439
That 's what?

508
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:20,378
What, Pauly?

509
01:05:21,217 --> 01:05:22,946
What?

510
01:07:15,398 --> 01:07:18,333
I had to play your townsperson
and my townsperson...

511
01:07:18,534 --> 01:07:21,401
and that 's two fucking
townspeople too many.

512
01:07:22,438 --> 01:07:24,872
This is for the final report.

513
01:07:25,841 --> 01:07:29,607
Mr. Spencer says "Gene Val Gene",
like he's some Italian barber.

514
01:07:29,812 --> 01:07:34,442
"Gene"! It 's Jean. He's French.
Even I know that.

515
01:07:34,650 --> 01:07:36,777
And Sister Carrie?
Forget it.

516
01:07:36,986 --> 01:07:40,683
I'm finally thinking we're on our
way to some serious storytelling...

517
01:07:40,890 --> 01:07:43,586
she is like no sister that I know.

518
01:07:50,099 --> 01:07:52,363
I couldn't find the pencils.

519
01:07:53,903 --> 01:07:57,134
Prom is in two weeks.

520
01:08:02,378 --> 01:08:06,337
Sorry you missed the meet.
I won hurdles.

521
01:08:07,216 --> 01:08:10,151
Apparently I have inborn talent.

522
01:08:16,892 --> 01:08:21,829
I hope you don't mind, I asked
Ludmilla to go to the Prom together.

523
01:08:29,338 --> 01:08:31,829
You look good.

524
01:08:33,342 --> 01:08:38,473
Rusty inhaled a leaf, so we had
to cancel the last performance.

525
01:08:41,117 --> 01:08:43,244
You've been drawing.

526
01:08:49,158 --> 01:08:52,719
Your father can't come till tonight.
He has work.

527
01:08:55,364 --> 01:09:00,961
I can only stay a little now. Your
grandmother needs a lift somewhere.

528
01:09:05,875 --> 01:09:07,775
Okay.

529
01:09:10,479 --> 01:09:13,937
Your grandmother didn't want me
to marry your father.

530
01:09:15,451 --> 01:09:20,150
I was pregnant, but I would've
married him even still.

531
01:09:21,824 --> 01:09:25,590
It was a cold one. November.

532
01:09:26,395 --> 01:09:32,356
Picked me up in his car. We went
to a diner and had French toast.

533
01:09:33,702 --> 01:09:36,899
Back in the car,
he tasted like syrup.

534
01:09:38,340 --> 01:09:41,309
We weren't so cold in the car.

535
01:09:47,249 --> 01:09:50,548
I want grandchildren.

536
01:09:52,988 --> 01:09:58,517
It was just your friend, right?
It wasn't you. You didn't want to.

537
01:10:05,968 --> 01:10:10,200
It 's like when sometimes someone
who wants to stop smoking...

538
01:10:10,406 --> 01:10:14,433
wears perhaps a rubber band
on their wrist.

539
01:10:14,877 --> 01:10:18,574
When they feel like smoking,
they snap the rubber band.

540
01:10:19,882 --> 01:10:23,113
They begin to associate
the pleasure of smoking...

541
01:10:23,319 --> 01:10:25,879
with the pain of the
rubber band snapping.

542
01:10:32,861 --> 01:10:34,590
Do you like that?

543
01:10:37,099 --> 01:10:39,226
What about it do you like?

544
01:10:41,971 --> 01:10:43,871
The shape.

545
01:10:44,073 --> 01:10:46,268
What about the shape?

546
01:10:50,479 --> 01:10:52,572
It 's pleasing...

547
01:10:56,318 --> 01:10:59,685
and pleasure is rare.

548
01:11:01,757 --> 01:11:04,157
Pleasure is complicated.

549
01:11:13,135 --> 01:11:15,330
But pleasure is good.

550
01:11:42,998 --> 01:11:45,660
Hey, Colin.
Hey, Ludmilla.

551
01:13:04,847 --> 01:13:06,781
Where is yours?

552
01:13:07,282 --> 01:13:09,113
Too late.

553
01:13:14,790 --> 01:13:17,258
I'm tired of being so popular.

554
01:13:17,459 --> 01:13:22,294
It 's just too easy. Just watch how
everyone behaves and act like that.

555
01:13:26,001 --> 01:13:30,961
The next time you see me,
I could be less popular.

556
01:13:58,033 --> 01:14:01,628
Your grandmother is going up
to her place in the Poconos.

557
01:14:02,504 --> 01:14:07,498
Your cousins are going with her.
And there's things to do...

558
01:14:07,709 --> 01:14:10,974
and you could be in the country.
Whatever.

559
01:14:11,680 --> 01:14:15,480
Paint, if you wanted.

560
01:14:24,693 --> 01:14:27,184
I saw your pictures.

561
01:15:47,776 --> 01:15:49,368
Look.

562
01:15:53,181 --> 01:15:55,411
- He was just right over there.
- What 's with him?

563
01:15:55,617 --> 01:15:57,983
- He's hungry, what?
- He's hungry? You just fed him!

564
01:15:58,186 --> 01:16:00,211
He's a baby!

565
01:16:02,124 --> 01:16:04,251
Come on, get in the car.

566
01:16:10,232 --> 01:16:12,132
I'm coming.

567
01:16:40,028 --> 01:16:42,519
I'd be graduating, but I quit.

568
01:16:42,731 --> 01:16:46,030
Working here, which is great!

569
01:16:46,668 --> 01:16:50,468
- I'm going to the Poconos.
- That 's so cool!

570
01:16:55,611 --> 01:16:58,341
I've got so many friends up there
and there's Water Mountain...

571
01:16:58,547 --> 01:17:01,641
and six kicking bands
come from that area.

572
01:17:01,917 --> 01:17:05,148
- Water Mountain?
- You want a Sprite or something?

573
01:17:05,454 --> 01:17:08,287
We get slugs for
the machines as a bonus.

574
01:21:43,698 --> 01:21:46,690
<i>CAPTIONS BY VIDEOLAR</i>

575
01:21:46,798 --> 01:21:51,690
