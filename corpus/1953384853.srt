1
00:00:13,546 --> 00:00:15,514
- This is it.
- You sure?

2
00:00:15,682 --> 00:00:18,879
It's the same bar that was in my dream.
Let's hurry.

3
00:00:25,325 --> 00:00:26,656
What the hell is this?

4
00:00:26,826 --> 00:00:29,522
- I forgot.
- There's an ice hockey game tonight.

5
00:00:30,263 --> 00:00:34,632
How are we going to find a man
we haven't even met yet in this crowd?

6
00:00:34,801 --> 00:00:38,601
He's about the same age as Dad.
Dark hair with a mole on his face.

7
00:00:38,772 --> 00:00:40,637
Hurry up and find him.

8
00:00:41,174 --> 00:00:43,108
A mole, eh?

9
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:47,676
Hi there.

10
00:00:47,847 --> 00:00:50,145
Are you an ice hockey fan too?

11
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:54,016
I gather you're from out of town?

12
00:00:54,187 --> 00:00:56,314
Yeah, never been to Saginaw before.

13
00:00:56,589 --> 00:00:59,581
Well, then, let's toast, shall we?

14
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:01,556
Sounds good to me.

15
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:03,423
Dean, I found him! This way!

16
00:01:04,197 --> 00:01:06,062
- Who's he?
- My little brother.

17
00:01:06,232 --> 00:01:07,392
He's good-looking.

18
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:10,229
But you are my type.

19
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:13,167
Dean, what the hell
are you doing? Hurry!

20
00:01:13,339 --> 00:01:15,603
See you again, baby.

21
00:01:15,775 --> 00:01:17,743
See you again.

22
00:01:20,447 --> 00:01:22,608
Are you Mr. Jim Miller?

23
00:01:24,684 --> 00:01:26,447
Yeah, what do you want?

24
00:01:26,619 --> 00:01:29,850
- He's the guy in my dream.
- Seriously?

25
00:01:30,023 --> 00:01:34,483
Mr. Miller, could we have a word with you?
It's very important.

26
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:37,120
I have nothing to talk about.

27
00:01:37,297 --> 00:01:41,028
Wait. This is important. Please, sir!

28
00:01:41,201 --> 00:01:45,160
No, you shouldn't go into the bathroom.
Mr. Miller, open the door!

29
00:01:46,539 --> 00:01:47,767
Huh?

30
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:52,207
- Damn.
- Sam, move over.

31
00:01:52,378 --> 00:01:54,005
Here we go.

32
00:01:57,984 --> 00:01:59,918
What the hell is going on?

33
00:02:21,174 --> 00:02:23,165
How could this be?

34
00:02:34,888 --> 00:02:40,656
What's the use of having premonitions
if you can't save people?

35
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:43,595
Are you sure he was killed?

36
00:02:43,763 --> 00:02:45,594
The police said it's an accident.

37
00:02:45,765 --> 00:02:49,064
No! I saw a dark shadow in my dream.

38
00:02:49,235 --> 00:02:53,137
He was pulled into that toilet
by some evil force.

39
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:58,707
Okay, okay.
Let's go talk to his family then.

40
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:21,026
We're from St. Augustine's.

41
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:25,001
We're sorry to hear about your father.

44
00:03:29,075 --> 00:03:31,566
Any other family members?

45
00:03:32,111 --> 00:03:33,738
My mom.

46
00:03:35,248 --> 00:03:38,513
Leave the woman to me.

47
00:03:39,752 --> 00:03:42,516
Max, tell me what your father was like.

48
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:46,022
Nothing special. He was a normal guy.

49
00:03:46,659 --> 00:03:50,254
He was a big fan
of the local ice hockey team.

50
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:52,091
He loved to drink.

51
00:03:52,332 --> 00:03:56,598
He would sometimes drink too much,
till he lost his memory.

52
00:03:56,769 --> 00:03:59,397
I think that's how
something like that happened.

53
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:00,971
I see.

54
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:05,042
I know it's hard on you,
but you have to...

55
00:04:05,211 --> 00:04:08,078
...look after your mom from now on.

56
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:09,545
Yeah.

57
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:14,010
How is this house?

58
00:04:14,187 --> 00:04:15,518
What do you mean?

59
00:04:15,688 --> 00:04:18,987
Well, an old house like this
tends to have its problems, right?

60
00:04:19,158 --> 00:04:22,594
Leaking pipes, wiring problems.

61
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:24,354
Not really.

62
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:27,556
We moved to this place five years ago
from Freeland.

63
00:04:27,734 --> 00:04:28,826
I see.

64
00:04:29,002 --> 00:04:33,063
In times like these, children of the Lord
must take hand in hand. Amen.

65
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,603
Jeez, Dean.

66
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:38,107
You guys are brothers?
You don't look alike.

67
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:39,575
I agree with you.

68
00:04:40,413 --> 00:04:43,211
We lost our mother
when we were little...

69
00:04:43,383 --> 00:04:46,216
...and it's been just our father
and us two since then.

70
00:04:46,386 --> 00:04:49,583
I fought with my father a lot.

71
00:04:49,756 --> 00:04:54,887
I left home to go to college
and haven't seen him since.

72
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:57,995
You've never thought of leaving home?

73
00:04:58,164 --> 00:05:03,101
I know, it's kind of embarrassing,
still living with my folks at 22.

74
00:05:03,269 --> 00:05:07,103
No. It means
you get along well as a family.

75
00:05:09,175 --> 00:05:11,109
Oh, sorry, I haven't introduced myself.

76
00:05:11,277 --> 00:05:14,713
I'm Sam. Sam Winchester.
Good to meet you.

77
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:19,340
Thanks.

78
00:05:20,286 --> 00:05:22,311
No electromagnetic disturbances, eh?

79
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:23,682
How's it going?

80
00:05:23,856 --> 00:05:25,653
No EMF reaction.

81
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:28,589
There are no evil spirits or demons
in this house.

82
00:05:28,928 --> 00:05:30,486
- Wipe that off.
- Huh?

83
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:32,426
- Ketchup.
- Oh.

84
00:05:32,598 --> 00:05:34,725
They've got good sausage.

85
00:05:34,901 --> 00:05:36,698
Unbelievable.

86
00:05:36,869 --> 00:05:38,234
- Hey, Dean.
- Huh?

87
00:05:39,906 --> 00:05:41,737
This is blood.

88
00:05:41,908 --> 00:05:43,899
It's not ketchup?

89
00:05:44,077 --> 00:05:46,375
Just kidding.

90
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:57,922
I had that blood analyzed.

91
00:05:58,091 --> 00:06:00,082
- It's dog's blood.
- Dog?

92
00:06:00,259 --> 00:06:02,420
There was no dog in that house.

93
00:06:02,595 --> 00:06:06,588
It might have been killed by
that black thing you saw in your dreams.

94
00:06:06,766 --> 00:06:08,495
I've been doing some research.

95
00:06:09,268 --> 00:06:14,706
But I found no killings that could have
been done by spirits or demons.

96
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:17,069
Yeah, things look
pretty slow around this town.

97
00:06:17,243 --> 00:06:21,077
No casinos, no strip joints.
It just makes me yawn.

98
00:06:22,482 --> 00:06:26,441
The bar where Jim died had
no signs of demons or spirits either.

99
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:30,079
Then why did I dream it?

100
00:06:30,256 --> 00:06:33,714
Man, I don't know.
You can't trust dreams.

101
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:36,418
Your dreams can't predict reality
all the time.

102
00:06:36,596 --> 00:06:41,556
If dreams could come true, I'd have
gotten laid by Kate Hudson by now.

103
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:43,292
It could be a curse.

104
00:06:44,303 --> 00:06:46,794
Someone might have had
a grudge against Jim.

105
00:06:46,973 --> 00:06:53,037
But his wife said Jim was a good husband
and never had any trouble with anyone.

106
00:06:53,212 --> 00:06:55,476
Then something might have
happened in Freeland.

107
00:06:55,648 --> 00:06:57,946
Max said they were there
until five years ago.

108
00:06:58,117 --> 00:07:00,745
Whoa, you're not thinking
of going to Freeland, are you?

109
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,410
Of course I am.

110
00:07:05,024 --> 00:07:07,219
Man, you're stubborn.

111
00:07:08,494 --> 00:07:10,485
- Jim Miller?
- Yes.

112
00:07:10,663 --> 00:07:13,723
I believe they had lived around here
until five years ago.

113
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,800
I remember them well.

114
00:07:15,968 --> 00:07:18,334
They used to live across the street.

115
00:07:18,504 --> 00:07:20,335
And what would you like to know?

116
00:07:20,506 --> 00:07:22,440
Is Max unharmed?

117
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:24,405
Unharmed, you say?

118
00:07:25,144 --> 00:07:26,975
I feel so sorry for that boy.

119
00:07:27,146 --> 00:07:31,515
His father, Jim, had no problem
outside their home.

120
00:07:31,684 --> 00:07:36,485
<i>But he'd come home drunk</i>
<i>and kick and hit Max.</i>

121
00:07:36,656 --> 00:07:38,351
<i>What in the world?</i>

122
00:07:39,158 --> 00:07:42,719
<i>I heard Jim yell
at him every single day.</i>

123
00:07:42,929 --> 00:07:45,159
<i>Max always had bruises.</i>

124
00:07:45,331 --> 00:07:49,028
<i>There were times I just had to</i>
<i>call the police.</i>

125
00:07:49,202 --> 00:07:53,138
<i>But each time his stepmother told</i>
<i>the police that everything was fine.</i>

126
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:55,206
<i>- Stepmother?</i> 
<i>- Yes.</i>

127
00:07:55,374 --> 00:08:00,107
<i>Max's real mother died</i>
<i>when he was just a baby.</i>

128
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:03,248
Their house caught fire.

129
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:06,317
That stepmother
pretended she didn't see anything...

130
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:07,748
...no matter how much
Max screamed and cried.

131
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:12,518
Hey, Sam.

132
00:08:12,692 --> 00:08:15,183
What's wrong? Sam.
Get ahold of yourself!

133
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:18,895
I didn't do anything, did I?

134
00:08:19,065 --> 00:08:20,828
Yeah, you're right.

135
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,127
You didn't do anything for me, Mom.

136
00:08:27,707 --> 00:08:31,473
You just stood there and watched.

137
00:08:31,644 --> 00:08:35,444
You never tried to help me. Ever.

138
00:08:39,886 --> 00:08:41,615
What are you doing?

139
00:08:45,324 --> 00:08:48,350
Impossible. How did you?

140
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:01,164
Max. Please stop.

141
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:04,400
How many times do you think
I begged for your help?

142
00:09:04,577 --> 00:09:08,775
You never did anything.
You just stood there watching.

143
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:14,213
I'm sorry. Please forgive me.

144
00:09:16,455 --> 00:09:18,116
Max!

145
00:09:23,362 --> 00:09:25,227
It's too late!

146
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:31,169
You okay, Sam?

147
00:09:31,337 --> 00:09:33,567
- Max did it.
- What?

148
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:37,607
Max killed Jim.
Now he's going to kill his stepmother.

149
00:09:37,777 --> 00:09:41,440
But how? Did he use
black magic or something?

150
00:09:41,614 --> 00:09:44,913
No. I think he used
some kind of telekinesis.

151
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:48,918
Telekinesis? Does that mean
he's a spoon-bender?

152
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:53,024
He doesn't need to touch things
to move them.

153
00:09:53,192 --> 00:09:55,820
The dark shadow
I saw in my vision was Max.

154
00:09:56,062 --> 00:09:58,895
My premonition must've been
linked to Max.

155
00:09:59,065 --> 00:10:00,999
Why would you and Max be connected?

156
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:04,933
I don't know.
Maybe it's because we're alike.

157
00:10:05,304 --> 00:10:06,430
How?

158
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:11,942
Well, we both lost our mothers
when we were little.

159
00:10:14,146 --> 00:10:16,580
No, you're totally wrong.
He's a murderer.

160
00:10:16,749 --> 00:10:19,240
But when you look at his childhood...

161
00:10:19,418 --> 00:10:22,080
And that justifies
him killing his entire family?

162
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:26,091
He's a monster.

163
00:10:26,726 --> 00:10:30,594
He's no different than
anything else we've hunted.

164
00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:32,956
Are you going to kill him?

165
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:36,158
We have to. Should we report
telekinesis to the police instead?

166
00:10:36,335 --> 00:10:38,929
They won't even arrest him,
much less lock him up.

167
00:10:39,105 --> 00:10:41,539
Or let him kill his stepmother?

168
00:10:41,707 --> 00:10:45,165
I know, but he is human.

169
00:10:45,344 --> 00:10:48,006
Let's talk to him. He'll understand.

170
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:51,980
Dean, please. Let me handle it this time.

171
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:56,044
All right. But I'm taking this with me.

172
00:10:56,222 --> 00:11:00,318
I don't have much of a chance
against telekinesis without a gun.

173
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:12,630
What are you doing?

174
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:23,042
Max, please. Help!

175
00:11:23,215 --> 00:11:27,015
How many times
have I begged for your help?

176
00:11:27,753 --> 00:11:31,120
I'm sorry. Please forgive me.

177
00:11:33,993 --> 00:11:35,585
It's too late!

178
00:11:49,975 --> 00:11:52,239
Father Winchester.

179
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:58,013
Max, I'd like to talk to you.

180
00:11:58,217 --> 00:12:01,584
Can we talk upstairs?
Just you and me?

181
00:12:08,627 --> 00:12:13,064
I heard about what you
went through in Freeland.

182
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:16,690
You've been beaten up
by your father, haven't you?

183
00:12:18,704 --> 00:12:20,331
You had a dog?

184
00:12:25,177 --> 00:12:28,544
<i>When my dad beat me</i>
<i>and threw me out in the rain...</i>

185
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:38,286
<i>...I found the puppy,</i>
<i>all skinny and ragged.</i>

186
00:12:38,457 --> 00:12:41,756
<i>It was as if I was
looking at myself.</i>

187
00:12:43,162 --> 00:12:46,529
So I snuck him back into the house
and kept him.

188
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:51,733
Hope was my only true family.

189
00:12:52,404 --> 00:12:55,965
But then Dad came home drunk
last week.

190
00:13:00,913 --> 00:13:02,540
Dad?

191
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:06,782
Max, what the hell
is this thing doing here?

192
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:09,648
Dad, stop! Don't hurt Hope!

193
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:16,758
Hope? What hope do you think
this world has anyway?

194
00:13:18,197 --> 00:13:21,997
What kind of hope
do you have in your life?

195
00:13:22,168 --> 00:13:23,931
You little demon!

196
00:13:29,441 --> 00:13:31,170
Please stop!

197
00:13:32,778 --> 00:13:35,008
Mom, help! Please help, Mom!

198
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:41,650
A demon like you
doesn't deserve to have a dog!

199
00:13:43,556 --> 00:13:47,356
You understand? Now take it out
and get rid of it.

200
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:02,140
Hope...

201
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:06,038
Dad hated me for the longest time.

202
00:14:06,212 --> 00:14:08,646
He called me a demon all the time.

203
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:10,839
- Demon?
- Yeah.

204
00:14:11,116 --> 00:14:15,485
Dad believed
that I had killed my real mother.

205
00:14:15,654 --> 00:14:17,144
Why is that?

206
00:14:17,323 --> 00:14:21,760
When I was sleeping in my crib...

207
00:14:21,927 --> 00:14:25,886
...my mom was pinned to
the ceiling above me.

208
00:14:26,932 --> 00:14:29,799
He told me that she burst
into flames and died.

209
00:14:35,307 --> 00:14:37,070
Max...

210
00:14:37,243 --> 00:14:40,303
...my mother and my girlfriend
died the same way.

211
00:14:42,481 --> 00:14:44,312
The same thing must've killed them.

212
00:14:44,483 --> 00:14:49,113
We must be connected somehow. That
explains why I had premonition about you.

213
00:14:49,288 --> 00:14:50,915
- Premonition?
- Yeah.

214
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:55,026
I saw you killing your father in
the bathroom at that bar in my dream.

215
00:14:56,462 --> 00:14:59,260
I also saw you stabbing your mom's eye
with a knife.

216
00:14:59,431 --> 00:15:01,023
That's why I rushed here.

217
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,258
That's impossible.

218
00:15:02,434 --> 00:15:05,335
I'm sure it's hard to believe,
but it's true.

219
00:15:05,504 --> 00:15:09,304
You started having these powers
about six months ago, didn't you?

220
00:15:09,475 --> 00:15:11,909
- Yeah.
- Me too.

221
00:15:12,378 --> 00:15:14,710
This has to mean something.

222
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,906
We've been chosen for a reason.

223
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:20,176
Reason?

224
00:15:20,352 --> 00:15:22,684
What the hell is the reason for this?

225
00:15:23,489 --> 00:15:26,515
What's the reason for me
being beaten all these years...

226
00:15:26,692 --> 00:15:28,182
...and for Hope being killed?

227
00:15:28,994 --> 00:15:31,724
I would've persevered
if it was just me.

228
00:15:31,897 --> 00:15:34,889
But he hurt Hope!

229
00:15:35,701 --> 00:15:39,432
This is a God-given gift, you see?
God gave it to me...

230
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:42,540
...who was alone and had nothing.

231
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:44,608
But you're not alone anymore.

232
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:49,111
I'm here for you.
I'm here because you called me.

233
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:55,516
In my dream you looked like
you were calling out for help.

234
00:15:57,323 --> 00:16:02,226
So, Max, please stop killing people
with your telekinetic power.

235
00:16:02,394 --> 00:16:05,022
I promise I'll help you.

236
00:16:08,901 --> 00:16:10,835
Thank you, Sam.

237
00:16:11,003 --> 00:16:14,962
But no one can help me.

238
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,539
Max, please.

239
00:16:16,709 --> 00:16:18,074
Forgive me.

240
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:26,477
Sam!

241
00:16:27,186 --> 00:16:28,585
Max?

242
00:16:29,955 --> 00:16:31,149
Where's Sam?

243
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:33,986
What was all that noise?

244
00:16:37,429 --> 00:16:40,398
You're not priests, are you?
Why do you have this?

245
00:16:40,566 --> 00:16:41,794
Max!

246
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:45,094
Don't do it.

247
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:47,135
Max!

248
00:16:57,816 --> 00:16:58,942
Dean!

249
00:17:04,957 --> 00:17:07,653
Max. Don't tell me...

250
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:12,121
Don't do it.

251
00:17:12,297 --> 00:17:14,527
Don't do it!

252
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:17,999
Sam!

253
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:20,528
Max?

254
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:28,309
Don't tell me... This is...

255
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:32,741
You're not priests, are you?
Why do you have this?

256
00:17:32,918 --> 00:17:34,044
Max!

257
00:17:35,687 --> 00:17:37,382
Don't do it.

258
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:39,114
Max.

259
00:17:39,992 --> 00:17:41,016
Don't shoot!

260
00:17:46,432 --> 00:17:48,662
Don't do it, Max.

261
00:17:50,035 --> 00:17:51,662
Sam.

262
00:17:51,837 --> 00:17:56,171
I promise I'll help you.
You don't need to deal with this alone.

263
00:17:56,341 --> 00:17:58,809
I know you know deep down...

264
00:17:58,977 --> 00:18:02,913
...that doing this won't help a thing.

265
00:18:03,849 --> 00:18:04,907
Max.

266
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:06,642
Please!

267
00:18:06,819 --> 00:18:08,878
Please don't shoot.

268
00:18:25,504 --> 00:18:28,940
You're right. This is meaningless.

269
00:18:53,932 --> 00:18:56,264
I shouldn't have said such a thing.

270
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:01,733
- You did what you could.
- Don't blame yourself.

271
00:19:04,409 --> 00:19:06,775
- Listen, Dean.
- What is it?

272
00:19:06,945 --> 00:19:11,609
I wonder why the demon killed
Mom, Jessica and Max's mom.

273
00:19:11,783 --> 00:19:13,410
Beats me.

274
00:19:13,585 --> 00:19:17,419
Maybe it was Max and me
that he was after.

275
00:19:17,589 --> 00:19:20,922
We both have these powers
that ordinary people don't.

276
00:19:21,527 --> 00:19:25,930
Maybe Mom and Jessica were killed
because of me.

277
00:19:29,601 --> 00:19:30,625
What was that for?

278
00:19:30,802 --> 00:19:33,134
To stop you from talking bullshit!

279
00:19:33,305 --> 00:19:38,299
- Bullshit?
- Yeah. You're always moaning...

280
00:19:38,477 --> 00:19:40,502
...about what might've been your fault.

281
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:44,342
The thing that killed them
is to be blamed. Not you.

282
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:46,074
<i>May I have your order?</i>

283
00:19:46,251 --> 00:19:49,448
Well, two cheeseburgers and two Cokes.

284
00:19:49,621 --> 00:19:51,111
<i>Very well, sir.</i>

285
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:53,824
There's one more thing I have to say.

286
00:19:53,992 --> 00:19:57,155
- Oh, jeez, what now?
- When I was locked up in Max's room...

287
00:19:57,329 --> 00:20:02,733
...I had a vision of you getting killed,
and then moved that heavy bed.

288
00:20:02,901 --> 00:20:06,064
Like Max, with telekinesis.

289
00:20:13,178 --> 00:20:14,406
Bend this.

290
00:20:15,847 --> 00:20:19,374
Aren't you worried?
What if I turn out like Max?

291
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:21,576
Nope. I'm not worried even a bit.

292
00:20:21,753 --> 00:20:24,017
Because you've got something
Max didn't have.

293
00:20:24,189 --> 00:20:26,555
Huh? What?

294
00:20:27,326 --> 00:20:28,918
Me.

295
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:35,896
I'm always with you
and will protect you all the way.

296
00:20:41,373 --> 00:20:43,136
Sounds creepy, you idiot.

297
00:20:45,777 --> 00:20:47,836
<i>- Here is the weather in Michigan.</i> 
- You baby.

298
00:20:48,013 --> 00:20:50,846
<i>We have sunny days ahead of us.</i> 
<i>No signs of rain for a while.</i>

299
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:56,185
<i>Tomorrow will be a beautiful day</i>
<i>with clear skies.</i>

300
00:22:09,628 --> 00:22:11,095
Thank you for waiting.

301
00:22:11,263 --> 00:22:12,924
Ah, you're...!

302
00:22:13,098 --> 00:22:15,862
My goodness. We did meet again.

303
00:22:17,035 --> 00:22:19,629
But, unfortunately, we're leaving town.

304
00:22:19,805 --> 00:22:22,603
Where are you headed?

305
00:22:22,774 --> 00:22:25,572
Don't know. Up to God's will.

306
00:22:25,744 --> 00:22:27,974
See you again, if I'm lucky.

307
00:22:28,146 --> 00:22:32,105
Be careful, boys.
A storm is coming.

308
00:22:35,053 --> 00:22:37,823
Sam. Dean. See you again someday.

309
00:22:37,823 --> 00:22:39,814
Sam. Dean. See you again someday.
