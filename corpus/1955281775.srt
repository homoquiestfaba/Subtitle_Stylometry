00:00:00,828 --> 00:00:04,411
(creepy synthesizer music)

2
00:01:59,129 --> 00:02:02,629
(creepy futuristic music)

3
00:03:03,529 --> 00:03:04,471
Hello, Jack.

4
00:03:04,471 --> 00:03:06,545
I guess I'm the last person
in the world you wanna see.

5
00:03:06,545 --> 00:03:08,023
(static)

6
00:03:08,023 --> 00:03:09,475
That's usually a pretty good guess.

7
00:03:09,475 --> 00:03:10,308
What's goin' on here?

8
00:03:10,308 --> 00:03:11,394
Jack, I'm pullin' you down the line.

9
00:03:11,394 --> 00:03:13,164
There's some place you have to be now.

10
00:03:13,164 --> 00:03:14,881
[Jack] Jennings, that
sounds like an order.

11
00:03:14,881 --> 00:03:16,422
Since I'm a senior
member of the council,

12
00:03:16,422 --> 00:03:18,422
you're damn right it is.

13
00:03:19,797 --> 00:03:20,850
Can't you just let it slide

14
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:23,176
until I've singed my last trancer?

15
00:03:23,176 --> 00:03:25,351
Where the hell you sending me this time?

16
00:03:25,351 --> 00:03:29,159
It's about your daughter
and your non-future.

17
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:31,791
What the hell are you talkin' about?

18
00:03:31,791 --> 00:03:33,443
God damn it, stop it!

19
00:03:33,443 --> 00:03:34,708
Surprise, Jack!

20
00:03:34,708 --> 00:03:37,291
You're goin' down the line now.

21
00:03:38,135 --> 00:03:39,666
Wait a minute, that's not what you...

22
00:03:39,666 --> 00:03:42,833
(futuristic whooshes)

23
00:03:46,507 --> 00:03:49,081
(city traffic)

24
00:03:49,081 --> 00:03:51,331
(crickets)

25
00:04:15,244 --> 00:04:16,786
Oh.

26
00:04:16,786 --> 00:04:18,282
Oh wow.

27
00:04:18,282 --> 00:04:19,449
Second pass at

28
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:24,487
10,

29
00:04:24,487 --> 00:04:25,431
43,

30
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:26,348
44 seconds,

31
00:04:27,466 --> 00:04:28,629
vector

32
00:04:28,629 --> 00:04:29,462
28

33
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:32,297
Declamation

34
00:04:33,849 --> 00:04:34,682
124.

35
00:04:41,827 --> 00:04:42,785
Hi, it's me.

36
00:04:42,785 --> 00:04:44,035
Did you see it?

37
00:04:45,538 --> 00:04:47,844
I'll be by tomorrow for
a confirmation report.

38
00:04:47,844 --> 00:04:49,344
Thanks a lot, Doc.

39
00:04:51,831 --> 00:04:54,563
What do you mean, be careful?

40
00:04:54,563 --> 00:04:55,396
Really?

41
00:04:56,967 --> 00:04:57,884
Are you OK?

42
00:04:59,413 --> 00:05:04,198
Well but why would anyone be
upset that we saw the meteor?

43
00:05:04,198 --> 00:05:06,627
No, no I'll be by tomorrow.

44
00:05:06,627 --> 00:05:07,460
OK, bye.

45
00:05:14,069 --> 00:05:15,537
Hello.

46
00:05:15,537 --> 00:05:16,914
Hello.

47
00:05:16,914 --> 00:05:18,179
Hello.

48
00:05:18,179 --> 00:05:19,331
(thud)

49
00:05:19,331 --> 00:05:20,164
Shoot!

50
00:05:22,086 --> 00:05:23,669
Please don't stain.

51
00:05:24,646 --> 00:05:26,229
Please don't stain.

52
00:05:31,971 --> 00:05:35,308
I need my cleaning deposit
back, thank you very much.

53
00:05:35,308 --> 00:05:37,322
(whoosh)

54
00:05:37,322 --> 00:05:38,815
(gasp)

55
00:05:38,815 --> 00:05:40,727
(thud)

56
00:05:40,727 --> 00:05:43,477
(dramatic music)

57
00:05:50,107 --> 00:05:53,598
That was an ass breaker of a ride.

58
00:05:53,598 --> 00:05:55,941
Too old to be goin' up and
down the line like this.

59
00:05:55,941 --> 00:05:57,941
I'm gonna kill Jennings.

60
00:06:00,492 --> 00:06:03,149
Shit, I need to clear my head.

61
00:06:03,149 --> 00:06:05,998
There's gotta be a shot of
booze around here some place.

62
00:06:05,998 --> 00:06:08,748
(dramatic music)

63
00:06:10,204 --> 00:06:12,787
(fridge opens)

64
00:06:14,653 --> 00:06:15,486
Oh God,

65
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:23,577
squid soda.

66
00:06:39,692 --> 00:06:40,525
My God.

67
00:06:44,614 --> 00:06:46,012
No,

68
00:06:46,012 --> 00:06:47,345
no, no Jennings,

69
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:50,678
I'm gonna tear you apart!

70
00:06:50,678 --> 00:06:53,015
(door lock clicks)

71
00:06:53,015 --> 00:06:55,765
(dramatic music)

72
00:07:08,264 --> 00:07:11,181
(door creaks open)

73
00:07:14,383 --> 00:07:15,216
Explain yourself, Toots.

74
00:07:15,216 --> 00:07:17,323
You'll be turnin' tricks
at the pearly gates.

75
00:07:17,323 --> 00:07:19,360
Let go of me, Trooper Deth.

76
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,520
You know, you should really
work on your technique.

77
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,437
Jennings.

78
00:07:23,885 --> 00:07:27,257
That's right, my great
great great grandma was a ho.

79
00:07:27,257 --> 00:07:29,491
I hope I don't look
surprised because I'm not.

80
00:07:29,491 --> 00:07:30,648
Very funny.

81
00:07:30,648 --> 00:07:32,978
Look, just don't go
blab to the council, OK?

82
00:07:32,978 --> 00:07:34,530
You know the tight asses they can be.

83
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:35,923
If you'd tell me what
the hell is going on.

84
00:07:35,923 --> 00:07:38,103
Whose body am I in?

85
00:07:38,103 --> 00:07:40,353
It's your daughter, Jack.

86
00:07:42,752 --> 00:07:45,453
You better start explaining now.

87
00:07:45,453 --> 00:07:48,205
I was doing a standard
monitor of the time continuum,

88
00:07:48,205 --> 00:07:51,671
just to make sure everything
was at it should be.

89
00:07:51,671 --> 00:07:52,941
We've gone down the line so many times,

90
00:07:52,941 --> 00:07:56,776
I'm surprised all of
history isn't out of whack.

91
00:07:56,776 --> 00:07:59,031
Your history might be, Jack.

92
00:07:59,031 --> 00:08:00,031
Take a look.

93
00:08:02,711 --> 00:08:04,768
When you left Lena back
in Old Los Angeles,

94
00:08:04,768 --> 00:08:07,341
she was pregnant with your daughter.

95
00:08:07,341 --> 00:08:08,978
When you met the child,
Lena let you believe

96
00:08:08,978 --> 00:08:10,388
that someone else was the father

97
00:08:10,388 --> 00:08:12,701
in order to spare your feelings.

98
00:08:12,701 --> 00:08:15,766
Well, I did a DNA trace, and she's yours.

99
00:08:15,766 --> 00:08:19,301
Otherwise, you couldn't
be in her body right now.

100
00:08:19,301 --> 00:08:20,830
Guess these time travel paradoxes

101
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:24,246
have finally gone from the
ridiculous to the sublime.

102
00:08:24,246 --> 00:08:25,694
[Jennings] Not really.

103
00:08:25,694 --> 00:08:29,345
She's in trouble, or should
I say, you're in trouble.

104
00:08:29,345 --> 00:08:31,716
Last time I was here, I
wiped out all the trancers.

105
00:08:31,716 --> 00:08:33,300
We don't know who or why.

106
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:35,187
I grabbed these images from the time belt,

107
00:08:35,187 --> 00:08:37,040
and they show the girl
fighting for her life.

108
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:40,443
If she loses, then you're erased.

109
00:08:40,443 --> 00:08:43,675
I mean, she exists in the
past, or well, right now,

110
00:08:43,675 --> 00:08:46,686
so eventually her descendants
will be your parents.

111
00:08:46,686 --> 00:08:47,755
Congratulations, Jack.

112
00:08:47,755 --> 00:08:50,650
You've just fathered your own
great great great grandmother.

113
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:53,357
Jesus, could you have
screwed this up anymore?

114
00:08:53,357 --> 00:08:55,106
I can't even get my brain around this.

115
00:08:55,106 --> 00:08:56,298
Then think of it this way.

116
00:08:56,298 --> 00:08:58,364
Someone is trying to kill your daughter,

117
00:08:58,364 --> 00:09:00,106
and I think it's a trancer.

118
00:09:00,106 --> 00:09:02,971
Maybe you should be a dad,
stay in her body, and save her.

119
00:09:02,971 --> 00:09:05,152
Full reinstatement?

120
00:09:05,152 --> 00:09:07,492
Lieutenant Jack Deth, you are
once again a trancer hunter,

121
00:09:07,492 --> 00:09:08,492
first class.

122
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:12,948
I don't know what your
daughter's gotten herself into.

123
00:09:12,948 --> 00:09:15,808
You have to find that out on your own.

124
00:09:15,808 --> 00:09:17,118
Shouldn't be too hard,

125
00:09:17,118 --> 00:09:19,441
singe a few trancers, be back by supper,

126
00:09:19,441 --> 00:09:20,308
you're buyin'.

127
00:09:20,308 --> 00:09:21,722
Deal.

128
00:09:21,722 --> 00:09:25,103
Oh Jennings, if you need
some cash before you go back,

129
00:09:25,103 --> 00:09:26,453
there's a convention in town.

130
00:09:26,453 --> 00:09:28,142
Just don't screw this up, Jack.

131
00:09:28,142 --> 00:09:31,892
Your daughter's life
and yours depends on it.

132
00:09:33,241 --> 00:09:36,459
(dramatic music)

133
00:09:36,459 --> 00:09:37,755
(door shuts)

134
00:09:37,755 --> 00:09:40,505
(dramatic music)

135
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:54,996
(toy squeaks)

136
00:09:54,996 --> 00:09:57,746
(dramatic music)

137
00:10:14,698 --> 00:10:16,080
OK, honey,

138
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,253
I'm gonna start off with your boss.

139
00:10:18,253 --> 00:10:21,097
See if I have to kill him or not.

140
00:10:21,097 --> 00:10:21,930
Cheers.

141
00:10:23,306 --> 00:10:25,389
(groans)

142
00:10:26,494 --> 00:10:27,327
Ugh!

143
00:10:27,327 --> 00:10:30,077
(dramatic music)

144
00:10:36,263 --> 00:10:37,096
Alright.

145
00:10:38,088 --> 00:10:40,655
You bastards are gonna go on
like you do in the commercials,

146
00:10:40,655 --> 00:10:41,822
nice and easy.

147
00:10:55,277 --> 00:10:56,769
(thuds)

148
00:10:56,769 --> 00:10:59,519
(birds chirping)

149
00:11:09,159 --> 00:11:10,659
Alright,

150
00:11:10,659 --> 00:11:13,409
my girl's got my taste in wheels.

151
00:11:20,566 --> 00:11:22,899
(car beeps)

152
00:11:32,341 --> 00:11:33,174
Oh God,

153
00:11:34,715 --> 00:11:37,798
I thought the skirt was embarrassing.

154
00:11:41,593 --> 00:11:44,843
(car engine shuts off)

155
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:52,035
(door shuts)

156
00:11:52,035 --> 00:11:53,235
Alright, come on,

157
00:11:53,235 --> 00:11:54,250
get your hot dogs, kids.

158
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:55,268
Good for ya.

159
00:11:55,268 --> 00:11:56,400
Eat up!

160
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,878
Get 'em while they're hot!

161
00:11:57,878 --> 00:11:59,739
Give me two with everything.

162
00:11:59,739 --> 00:12:01,653
Miss Jo, is that you?

163
00:12:01,653 --> 00:12:03,608
Course it is.

164
00:12:03,608 --> 00:12:04,632
Come on, snap to it, will ya?

165
00:12:04,632 --> 00:12:06,768
My gut's chewin' itself in half.

166
00:12:06,768 --> 00:12:08,312
OK, it's just that I've never been able

167
00:12:08,312 --> 00:12:11,819
to sell you anything
but organic sesame buns.

168
00:12:11,819 --> 00:12:15,902
New diet, fats, animal
protein, and carbs only.

169
00:12:16,878 --> 00:12:18,716
What about them?

170
00:12:18,716 --> 00:12:20,881
Now you know I give away freebies,

171
00:12:20,881 --> 00:12:22,492
thanks to good customers like you,

172
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:25,797
they don't have to eat
out of the trash can.

173
00:12:25,797 --> 00:12:27,297
Keep the change.

174
00:12:35,991 --> 00:12:38,741
(phones ringing)

175
00:12:40,455 --> 00:12:41,875
Hi, Miss Forrest.

176
00:12:41,875 --> 00:12:43,383
Hey, Toots.

177
00:12:43,383 --> 00:12:44,216
Beef?

178
00:12:45,055 --> 00:12:46,055
No thanks.

179
00:12:47,986 --> 00:12:50,736
(phones ringing)

180
00:13:04,422 --> 00:13:05,649
(clears throat)

181
00:13:05,649 --> 00:13:08,770
Gee, Miss Forrest, you
forget where you work?

182
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:11,020
(chuckles)

183
00:13:13,452 --> 00:13:15,958
Your desk is right...

184
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:17,505
That's your name on it.

185
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:19,374
(chuckles)

186
00:13:19,374 --> 00:13:20,207
Yeah.

187
00:13:22,452 --> 00:13:23,732
Jesus.

188
00:13:23,732 --> 00:13:24,815
What a squid.

189
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:40,490
(dramatic music)

190
00:13:46,311 --> 00:13:50,082
(keyboard clicking)

191
00:13:50,082 --> 00:13:51,614
(computer beeps)

192
00:13:51,614 --> 00:13:53,367
[Voiceover] Mr. Castle
will see you, Josephine.

193
00:13:53,367 --> 00:13:54,458
What?

194
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:57,634
Mr. Castle decided to
give you five minutes.

195
00:13:57,634 --> 00:13:58,608
I suggest you don't waste it

196
00:13:58,608 --> 00:14:01,525
with your usual outer space babble.

197
00:14:07,468 --> 00:14:09,247
What are you staring at?

198
00:14:09,247 --> 00:14:11,713
Somebody's been workin' out.

199
00:14:11,713 --> 00:14:13,771
I mean, that outfit is very becoming.

200
00:14:13,771 --> 00:14:15,461
This is your last chance, Josephine.

201
00:14:15,461 --> 00:14:18,128
Save your flattery for the boss.

202
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:23,325
That's a great suit, Mr. Castle.

203
00:14:23,325 --> 00:14:25,658
Have a seat, Miss Forrest.

204
00:14:27,296 --> 00:14:28,668
I meant at the other end.

205
00:14:28,668 --> 00:14:29,876
I like to look right
into somebody's eyes

206
00:14:29,876 --> 00:14:31,376
when I grill them.

207
00:14:33,514 --> 00:14:35,369
You requested this audience,

208
00:14:35,369 --> 00:14:37,233
but I'm gonna make it
easier on both of us.

209
00:14:37,233 --> 00:14:39,339
Now, I looked over your report,

210
00:14:39,339 --> 00:14:41,124
and I even checked with NASA,

211
00:14:41,124 --> 00:14:43,210
and there is no evidence
of a meteor shower

212
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:44,901
in the area you pinpointed.

213
00:14:44,901 --> 00:14:47,722
That plus the fact that this
has nothing to do with your job

214
00:14:47,722 --> 00:14:50,978
means I don't want to be
bothered with this again.

215
00:14:50,978 --> 00:14:52,230
This meeting is over.

216
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:53,063
Hold it, pal.

217
00:14:53,063 --> 00:14:55,434
I got some questions.

218
00:14:55,434 --> 00:14:57,492
What have I done that's
got you in such a sweat?

219
00:14:57,492 --> 00:14:58,747
Excuse me?

220
00:14:58,747 --> 00:15:01,121
Look, I've seen martian
molesters put up better fronts

221
00:15:01,121 --> 00:15:03,691
than you're doin' right now.

222
00:15:03,691 --> 00:15:05,858
Have you lost your mind?

223
00:15:07,155 --> 00:15:09,620
There's a video of this
thing crashing to the earth.

224
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:12,282
Why are you saying it didn't happen?

225
00:15:12,282 --> 00:15:15,312
Well I'm sorry I didn't
make myself clearer.

226
00:15:15,312 --> 00:15:19,148
One, what you saw was a gaseous explosion

227
00:15:19,148 --> 00:15:21,024
above the earth's atmosphere.

228
00:15:21,024 --> 00:15:21,857
And two,

229
00:15:23,059 --> 00:15:24,142
you're fired.

230
00:15:34,265 --> 00:15:36,682
I know what you are, buddy.

231
00:15:40,154 --> 00:15:42,743
Oh, I lied about the outfit,

232
00:15:42,743 --> 00:15:45,910
but I still think you got a great ass.

233
00:15:59,295 --> 00:16:02,045
(dramatic music)

234
00:16:05,528 --> 00:16:07,654
Smoking's illegal, Miss Forrest.

235
00:16:07,654 --> 00:16:08,726
You know that.

236
00:16:08,726 --> 00:16:09,559
Sorry.

237
00:16:10,657 --> 00:16:11,490
Forgot.

238
00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:13,026
Bad habits die hard.

239
00:16:13,026 --> 00:16:15,776
(dramatic music)

240
00:16:21,498 --> 00:16:23,868
Just remember, smoking was
the leading cause of cancer

241
00:16:23,868 --> 00:16:25,764
in women under 30.

242
00:16:25,764 --> 00:16:26,941
(elevator dings)

243
00:16:26,941 --> 00:16:29,691
(elevator opens)

244
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,367
Gee, Miss Forrest,

245
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:36,703
office scuttlebutt is that

246
00:16:36,703 --> 00:16:39,381
you're not gonna be with us anymore.

247
00:16:39,381 --> 00:16:41,634
'Cause I'm gonna rip your damn head off.

248
00:16:41,634 --> 00:16:42,801
Get over here!

249
00:16:44,263 --> 00:16:45,778
(grunts)

250
00:16:45,778 --> 00:16:47,945
(punches)

251
00:16:54,496 --> 00:16:57,246
(dramatic music)

252
00:17:07,187 --> 00:17:09,312
You're gonna learn to mind
your own business, bitch!

253
00:17:09,312 --> 00:17:12,365
You're gonna learn Jo Deth
doesn't take any trancer crap.

254
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:14,239
(fire extinguisher sprays)

255
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:16,090
Who the hell is Jo Deth?

256
00:17:16,090 --> 00:17:17,470
(gunshot)

257
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:19,553
(grunts)

258
00:17:20,872 --> 00:17:22,303
Tell me about Castle.

259
00:17:22,303 --> 00:17:24,257
What kinda trancer scam's he got goin' on?

260
00:17:24,257 --> 00:17:26,217
All I know is they want you dead.

261
00:17:26,217 --> 00:17:27,217
Who are you?

262
00:17:28,186 --> 00:17:29,542
You first.

263
00:17:29,542 --> 00:17:32,558
Answer the question, you
might live 'til noon.

264
00:17:32,558 --> 00:17:35,739
You can't scare someone
who doesn't care about dying.

265
00:17:35,739 --> 00:17:38,515
(grunts)

266
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:41,434
(crashes)

267
00:17:41,434 --> 00:17:43,601
(screams)

268
00:17:52,813 --> 00:17:56,425
(cell phone rings)

269
00:17:56,425 --> 00:17:57,258
Yeah?

270
00:17:57,258 --> 00:17:58,280
[Voiceover] Josephine, is that you?

271
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,398
I've been waiting for half an hour.

272
00:17:59,398 --> 00:18:00,231
Where are you?

273
00:18:00,231 --> 00:18:01,126
[Voiceover] Have you lost your senses?

274
00:18:01,126 --> 00:18:04,011
At the observatory, of course.

275
00:18:04,011 --> 00:18:06,761
(dramatic music)

276
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:16,854
(car engine starts)

277
00:18:16,854 --> 00:18:19,604
(dramatic music)

278
00:18:42,493 --> 00:18:45,243
(birds chirping)

279
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:51,400
(car door shuts)

280
00:18:53,657 --> 00:18:56,740
(machinery whirring)

281
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:15,258
Professor Malvern?

282
00:19:15,258 --> 00:19:18,341
(machinery whirring)

283
00:19:21,477 --> 00:19:24,477
(keyboard clicking)

284
00:19:26,163 --> 00:19:27,171
Doc, you don't have any Old Harper

285
00:19:27,171 --> 00:19:29,092
to take the curse off this stuff, do ya?

286
00:19:29,092 --> 00:19:30,470
Oh, I never touch spirits,

287
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:31,970
but I might start.

288
00:19:33,891 --> 00:19:36,670
Here are the sightings you
made and my verifications.

289
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:37,890
Everything checks.

290
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:39,250
The meteor definitely came to earth

291
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:42,375
approximately 340 miles due south.

292
00:19:42,375 --> 00:19:44,905
But meteor showers do happen.

293
00:19:44,905 --> 00:19:46,425
Some penetrate the atmosphere?

294
00:19:46,425 --> 00:19:48,661
Well you know they do, all the time,

295
00:19:48,661 --> 00:19:51,515
but only one in every
200 thousand ever reaches

296
00:19:51,515 --> 00:19:52,924
a populated area.

297
00:19:52,924 --> 00:19:55,378
So it's rare, but why is
everybody so pissed off?

298
00:19:55,378 --> 00:19:59,492
Well I don't know
what's upsetting people.

299
00:19:59,492 --> 00:20:01,323
Maybe the aliens have finally landed.

300
00:20:01,323 --> 00:20:02,738
Wouldn't that be something?

301
00:20:02,738 --> 00:20:03,648
I've met 'em, Doc.

302
00:20:03,648 --> 00:20:05,014
They're no great shakes.

303
00:20:05,014 --> 00:20:06,264
Smell bad, too.

304
00:20:07,881 --> 00:20:10,030
Listen, we're not the only
ones that saw this thing.

305
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:11,369
Well, certainly not,

306
00:20:11,369 --> 00:20:13,011
but we don't know what
happens to the information

307
00:20:13,011 --> 00:20:15,255
once we inform the authorities, do we?

308
00:20:15,255 --> 00:20:16,929
Thousands of people
could have reported it,

309
00:20:16,929 --> 00:20:19,359
no reason to single us out.

310
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:21,385
Except me, I'm the one they want dead.

311
00:20:21,385 --> 00:20:22,572
Oh, Josephine.

312
00:20:22,572 --> 00:20:24,090
It's true, Doc.

313
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:26,840
(dramatic music)

314
00:20:30,885 --> 00:20:32,274
We're targets, Doc.

315
00:20:32,274 --> 00:20:34,036
What are we going to do?

316
00:20:34,036 --> 00:20:35,327
Kick some ass.

317
00:20:35,327 --> 00:20:38,077
(dramatic music)

318
00:20:44,468 --> 00:20:46,409
Stay here and take notes, Doc.

319
00:20:46,409 --> 00:20:47,831
What are you going to do?

320
00:20:47,831 --> 00:20:49,641
Show these punks you
don't screw with nerds.

321
00:20:49,641 --> 00:20:52,224
(music swells)

322
00:21:01,657 --> 00:21:03,203
(car door shuts)

323
00:21:03,203 --> 00:21:06,203
(suspenseful music)

324
00:21:18,023 --> 00:21:20,329
That bitch ain't goin' nowhere!

325
00:21:20,329 --> 00:21:21,846
(punches)

326
00:21:21,846 --> 00:21:23,611
I ain't anybody's bitch.

327
00:21:23,611 --> 00:21:26,353
(gunshot)

328
00:21:26,353 --> 00:21:27,767
(gunshot)

329
00:21:27,767 --> 00:21:29,740
(gunshot)

330
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:33,554
(multiple gunshots)

331
00:21:33,554 --> 00:21:34,721
That was easy.

332
00:21:35,644 --> 00:21:38,797
(two gunshots)

333
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:41,380
(music swells)

334
00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:47,884
(rapid gunfire)

335
00:21:47,884 --> 00:21:50,467
(music swells)

336
00:22:00,251 --> 00:22:02,315
Just give me a minute to pray.

337
00:22:02,315 --> 00:22:03,943
How about a second to die?

338
00:22:03,943 --> 00:22:05,235
That's all I'll need.

339
00:22:05,235 --> 00:22:08,040
(watch beeps)

340
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:10,290
(whooshes)

341
00:22:12,503 --> 00:22:15,482
(slow motion gunfire)

342
00:22:15,482 --> 00:22:18,482
(suspenseful music)

343
00:22:24,771 --> 00:22:28,485
(car engine starts)

344
00:22:28,485 --> 00:22:29,619
Where the hell is she?

345
00:22:29,619 --> 00:22:32,619
(suspenseful music)

346
00:22:43,881 --> 00:22:45,677
(gunshot)

347
00:22:45,677 --> 00:22:48,677
(suspenseful music)

348
00:22:53,863 --> 00:22:57,280
Won't be needing this anymore, asshole.

349
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,333
Yeah, I like it.

350
00:23:17,811 --> 00:23:19,350
I'm not sure about this, Josephine.

351
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:21,261
People have been doing it
for a hell of a long time, Doc.

352
00:23:21,261 --> 00:23:23,706
Just point and shoot.

353
00:23:23,706 --> 00:23:24,823
Those creeps would have killed you

354
00:23:24,823 --> 00:23:26,315
if they had gotten inside.

355
00:23:26,315 --> 00:23:27,282
Next time somebody shows up,

356
00:23:27,282 --> 00:23:29,880
I may not be here to save your ass.

357
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,849
What about the body?

358
00:23:31,849 --> 00:23:34,516
There shouldn't be any bodies.

359
00:23:37,897 --> 00:23:39,328
Remember, next time
somebody you don't know

360
00:23:39,328 --> 00:23:40,211
sticks their nose in the door,

361
00:23:40,211 --> 00:23:41,044
blow it off.

362
00:23:41,044 --> 00:23:43,544
I'll be back as soon as I can.

363
00:23:44,885 --> 00:23:45,735
(car door slams)

364
00:23:45,735 --> 00:23:48,568
(car engine revs)

365
00:23:55,735 --> 00:23:57,044
I'll get you, you little runt,

366
00:23:57,044 --> 00:23:58,954
if it's the last thing I do.

367
00:23:58,954 --> 00:24:01,704
(dramatic music)

368
00:24:05,023 --> 00:24:08,002
Jesus, his pulse is falling.

369
00:24:08,002 --> 00:24:09,523
Below 50, temperature dropping.

370
00:24:09,523 --> 00:24:12,023
(alarm beeps)

371
00:24:18,813 --> 00:24:21,821
(car engine shuts down)

372
00:24:21,821 --> 00:24:24,904
(inaudible dialogue)

373
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:34,952
(car door shuts)

374
00:24:34,952 --> 00:24:38,119
How are you still alive though, man?

375
00:24:42,582 --> 00:24:45,332
Hey, I've been lookin' for you.

376
00:24:47,244 --> 00:24:48,962
Boy, did you pick the wrong time.

377
00:24:48,962 --> 00:24:50,267
No, you did, Jack.

378
00:24:50,267 --> 00:24:51,722
Here, I know you burned the first one,

379
00:24:51,722 --> 00:24:52,630
so here's a replacement.

380
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:54,683
Just don't waste it.

381
00:24:54,683 --> 00:24:56,517
How's the case coming?

382
00:24:56,517 --> 00:24:59,021
I know the who, but I
haven't figured out the why.

383
00:24:59,021 --> 00:25:00,400
Every time I start asking questions,

384
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,317
trancers pop up and start shootin'.

385
00:25:04,796 --> 00:25:07,026
I singed five today, new kill record.

386
00:25:07,026 --> 00:25:08,867
Congratulations, but you
better break the record

387
00:25:08,867 --> 00:25:10,066
for finding the killer,

388
00:25:10,066 --> 00:25:12,377
because you're starting to fade.

389
00:25:12,377 --> 00:25:13,899
What the hell are you talking about?

390
00:25:13,899 --> 00:25:17,232
In the TCL lab, your existence
up the line is ceasing,

391
00:25:17,232 --> 00:25:18,791
which means in the very near future...

392
00:25:18,791 --> 00:25:20,851
I'm or my kid's gonna die.

393
00:25:20,851 --> 00:25:23,240
Unless you can stop it, fast.

394
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:25,657
(car engine)

395
00:25:29,533 --> 00:25:32,283
(dramatic music)

396
00:25:34,105 --> 00:25:35,016
I gotta tail these kids,

397
00:25:35,016 --> 00:25:36,375
and you gotta get the hell out of here

398
00:25:36,375 --> 00:25:38,964
before you get busted.

399
00:25:38,964 --> 00:25:41,084
God, I hate trancer hunters.

400
00:25:41,084 --> 00:25:43,203
(car engine starts)

401
00:25:43,203 --> 00:25:45,953
(dramatic music)

402
00:26:45,479 --> 00:26:46,852
(car door shuts)

403
00:26:46,852 --> 00:26:49,852
(suspenseful music)

404
00:27:40,194 --> 00:27:41,361
Remember me?

405
00:27:45,351 --> 00:27:47,268
Shouldn't you be dead

406
00:27:47,268 --> 00:27:48,658
or at least in school?

407
00:27:48,658 --> 00:27:49,491
Move it.

408
00:27:50,834 --> 00:27:53,894
Hey, if you let me go, I'll
make it worth your while.

409
00:27:53,894 --> 00:27:56,168
Unless you've got an extra eye in there,

410
00:27:56,168 --> 00:27:57,409
I'm not interested.

411
00:27:57,409 --> 00:28:00,340
No really, I've got some great
stuff in my car to give ya.

412
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:01,730
You can't give me anything

413
00:28:01,730 --> 00:28:06,472
that compares with what
I'll get for catching you.

414
00:28:06,472 --> 00:28:08,211
(dramatic music)

415
00:28:08,211 --> 00:28:10,972
Everybody gets a little blue friend.

416
00:28:10,972 --> 00:28:11,805
Move it!

417
00:28:14,476 --> 00:28:18,386
Just swallow and enjoy the nice ride.

418
00:28:18,386 --> 00:28:21,397
Why Miss Jo, good to see you.

419
00:28:21,397 --> 00:28:22,964
Yeah, it'll be good to see you

420
00:28:22,964 --> 00:28:23,797
on a slab.

421
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:34,368
You were supposed to kill her.

422
00:28:34,368 --> 00:28:35,672
Yeah,

423
00:28:35,672 --> 00:28:36,743
this is even better.

424
00:28:36,743 --> 00:28:38,653
You better hope Miss Shauna thinks so,

425
00:28:38,653 --> 00:28:41,658
or she'll burn out that other eye.

426
00:28:41,658 --> 00:28:44,825
(gentle guitar music)

427
00:28:52,509 --> 00:28:53,759
Jesus Christ.

428
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:57,632
I don't know if he can hear you.

429
00:28:58,787 --> 00:29:01,352
You don't think much of
this place either, kid, huh?

430
00:29:01,352 --> 00:29:02,185
Kid?

431
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:05,069
How old are you?

432
00:29:05,069 --> 00:29:07,597
Older than you think.

433
00:29:07,597 --> 00:29:10,309
So where'd they pick you up?

434
00:29:10,309 --> 00:29:14,476
Sleeping in a doorway on
Argyle, like the rest of us.

435
00:29:18,985 --> 00:29:21,479
All these kids runaways?

436
00:29:21,479 --> 00:29:24,224
Runaways 'cause mom and
dad tossed our asses out

437
00:29:24,224 --> 00:29:26,910
or dad couldn't keep his
slong away from his daughter.

438
00:29:26,910 --> 00:29:30,135
Rest of 'em are just your run
of the mill bums and winos.

439
00:29:30,135 --> 00:29:31,933
Everybody's got a real nice story.

440
00:29:31,933 --> 00:29:33,379
What about you?

441
00:29:33,379 --> 00:29:34,866
(guitar strum)

442
00:29:34,866 --> 00:29:37,066
I'm just a musician
who's old lady shot herself

443
00:29:37,066 --> 00:29:39,158
and the cops think I did it.

444
00:29:39,158 --> 00:29:42,856
So, this place is just fine for me.

445
00:29:42,856 --> 00:29:47,257
By the way, everything I
just admitted is bullshit

446
00:29:47,257 --> 00:29:49,152
in case anybody asks.

447
00:29:49,152 --> 00:29:50,319
Fair enough.

448
00:29:51,484 --> 00:29:52,969
So how come you're not havin' a big time

449
00:29:52,969 --> 00:29:56,335
starin' in to space like your friends.

450
00:29:56,335 --> 00:29:58,243
I spit my little blue friends out.

451
00:29:58,243 --> 00:30:02,050
Around here, it's a good idea
to keep your head on straight.

452
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:03,866
Guess it's pretty easy
to control a bunch of kids

453
00:30:03,866 --> 00:30:06,383
if they're zonked out of their minds.

454
00:30:06,383 --> 00:30:07,649
You can get some in
front of the transformer

455
00:30:07,649 --> 00:30:08,631
without a fight.

456
00:30:08,631 --> 00:30:10,968
What the hell's a transformer?

457
00:30:10,968 --> 00:30:14,051
You haven't been indoctrinated yet.

458
00:30:15,170 --> 00:30:17,253
Oh, you're gonna love it.

459
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:23,259
(door opens)

460
00:30:23,259 --> 00:30:24,092
Hey!

461
00:30:25,227 --> 00:30:27,775
You meet your family leader in two hours.

462
00:30:27,775 --> 00:30:29,614
Get some rest.

463
00:30:29,614 --> 00:30:31,447
It'll be a long night.

464
00:30:32,332 --> 00:30:34,749
(door slams)

465
00:30:36,944 --> 00:30:39,333
Hey, it can get pretty
cold in here at night

466
00:30:39,333 --> 00:30:41,620
in case you wanna share some body warmth.

467
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:43,287
I'm not into guys.

468
00:30:45,959 --> 00:30:48,792
I mean, just stick to your guitar.

469
00:30:55,537 --> 00:30:58,704
(gentle guitar music)

470
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:02,797
(car engine)

471
00:31:08,963 --> 00:31:11,907
(car door shuts)

472
00:31:11,907 --> 00:31:14,990
Welcome to your new home, children.

473
00:31:16,597 --> 00:31:18,096
Holy shit,

474
00:31:18,096 --> 00:31:19,972
Miss Work Out herself.

475
00:31:19,972 --> 00:31:21,864
You know Miss West?

476
00:31:21,864 --> 00:31:23,347
She's the reason we're all here.

477
00:31:23,347 --> 00:31:27,514
I know that you have all had
a hard life on the streets,

478
00:31:28,892 --> 00:31:32,225
but the days of living in fear are over.

479
00:31:33,114 --> 00:31:34,114
From now on,

480
00:31:35,475 --> 00:31:38,142
others will live in fear of you.

481
00:31:40,827 --> 00:31:43,117
And your new family

482
00:31:43,117 --> 00:31:45,117
will protect you always.

483
00:31:47,204 --> 00:31:51,006
For I've been given a gift from the sky,

484
00:31:51,006 --> 00:31:54,000
and I choose to share it with you.

485
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,373
When somebody hassles you,

486
00:31:56,373 --> 00:31:58,125
don't you wanna fight back?

487
00:31:58,125 --> 00:31:59,377
[All] Yeah.

488
00:31:59,377 --> 00:32:01,074
When you're broke and you're cold

489
00:32:01,074 --> 00:32:05,010
and nobody gives a damn
whether you live or you die,

490
00:32:05,010 --> 00:32:06,613
don't you wanna show some strength?

491
00:32:06,613 --> 00:32:07,703
[All] Yeah!

492
00:32:07,703 --> 00:32:10,891
Prove to the world that you exist?

493
00:32:10,891 --> 00:32:12,391
That you do count.

494
00:32:13,297 --> 00:32:14,130
[All] Yeah!

495
00:32:14,130 --> 00:32:15,980
Yeah, then come to me,

496
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:19,230
and I'll give you all of that and more.

497
00:32:20,498 --> 00:32:21,831
Come and receive

498
00:32:23,219 --> 00:32:25,043
a gift from the stars.

499
00:32:25,043 --> 00:32:28,043
(suspenseful music)

500
00:32:34,432 --> 00:32:36,515
(lasers)

501
00:32:40,965 --> 00:32:41,798
Done.

502
00:32:43,808 --> 00:32:44,641
Now.

503
00:32:46,884 --> 00:32:48,967
(lasers)

504
00:32:52,892 --> 00:32:53,725
Done.

505
00:32:55,690 --> 00:32:58,107
Feel your strength, children.

506
00:33:01,019 --> 00:33:03,892
So this is how it all got started again.

507
00:33:03,892 --> 00:33:06,139
I'll be a son of a bitch.

508
00:33:06,139 --> 00:33:08,077
How what got started?

509
00:33:08,077 --> 00:33:09,730
Trancing,

510
00:33:09,730 --> 00:33:12,213
something you don't know about
and don't wanna know about.

511
00:33:12,213 --> 00:33:13,046
What?

512
00:33:14,615 --> 00:33:16,265
All this bug eyed monster crap?

513
00:33:16,265 --> 00:33:20,432
Hey, three hots and a cot, plus
I get to see some wild shit.

514
00:33:23,591 --> 00:33:24,511
Bring him out.

515
00:33:24,511 --> 00:33:26,761
(grunting)

516
00:33:40,421 --> 00:33:43,051
Some of you know my history,

517
00:33:43,051 --> 00:33:46,051
heroin, armed robbery, prostitution.

518
00:33:47,177 --> 00:33:51,344
A life on the streets at
the hands of men like this,

519
00:33:52,615 --> 00:33:55,327
but I found the strength to
break away from that life

520
00:33:55,327 --> 00:33:58,885
and rebuild myself and to help others.

521
00:33:58,885 --> 00:34:01,052
I was lost, just like you,

522
00:34:03,142 --> 00:34:05,918
but I found a source of strength.

523
00:34:05,918 --> 00:34:07,976
Are you gonna let

524
00:34:07,976 --> 00:34:09,722
men like that

525
00:34:09,722 --> 00:34:13,233
throw you away like you are nothing?

526
00:34:13,233 --> 00:34:16,130
He thinks that you're garbage.

527
00:34:16,130 --> 00:34:17,974
Did you know that?

528
00:34:17,974 --> 00:34:19,143
Garbage.

529
00:34:19,143 --> 00:34:20,785
Is that what you are?

530
00:34:20,785 --> 00:34:23,785
(suspenseful music)

531
00:34:25,294 --> 00:34:27,208
(grunting)

532
00:34:27,208 --> 00:34:29,397
(screaming)

533
00:34:29,397 --> 00:34:32,397
(suspenseful music)

534
00:34:48,512 --> 00:34:51,038
Don't be lost anymore.

535
00:34:51,038 --> 00:34:53,012
You're part of a family now.

536
00:34:53,012 --> 00:34:54,770
[All] Yeah!

537
00:34:54,770 --> 00:34:56,831
That's all for tonight.

538
00:34:56,831 --> 00:34:59,081
(grunting)

539
00:35:01,271 --> 00:35:02,869
We have to get these
children back to the city

540
00:35:02,869 --> 00:35:06,108
so they can show their strength and unity.

541
00:35:06,108 --> 00:35:07,690
(car engine starts)

542
00:35:07,690 --> 00:35:09,159
Where are they taking them?

543
00:35:09,159 --> 00:35:10,413
All over the city,

544
00:35:10,413 --> 00:35:13,056
wherever Miss Shauna thinks
they'll do the most good.

545
00:35:13,056 --> 00:35:15,806
(car door shuts)

546
00:35:16,645 --> 00:35:19,645
(suspenseful music)

547
00:35:23,050 --> 00:35:25,633
(music swells)

548
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:30,508
(screaming)

549
00:35:30,508 --> 00:35:33,508
(suspenseful music)

550
00:36:04,539 --> 00:36:07,049
Good job, now eat your fill.

551
00:36:07,049 --> 00:36:09,299
(grunting)

552
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,210
(coughing)

553
00:36:14,943 --> 00:36:18,146
Hey, don't you know too many
of those ain't good for you?

554
00:36:18,146 --> 00:36:20,344
(coughing)

555
00:36:20,344 --> 00:36:23,344
(suspenseful music)

556
00:36:42,046 --> 00:36:44,956
The police should be discovering
the bodies any time now.

557
00:36:44,956 --> 00:36:46,888
They were perfect.

558
00:36:46,888 --> 00:36:49,979
The taste of blood worked
them into such a frenzy,

559
00:36:49,979 --> 00:36:53,528
all we had to do was turn them loose.

560
00:36:53,528 --> 00:36:56,354
And the media should be
crawling all over the crime scene.

561
00:36:56,354 --> 00:36:58,814
Now the public's going to
be shaking in their beds.

562
00:36:58,814 --> 00:36:59,850
Shocking.

563
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:01,921
Imagine a man and woman killed

564
00:37:01,921 --> 00:37:03,555
right in front of their own home.

565
00:37:03,555 --> 00:37:05,892
A deputy mayor and his wife.

566
00:37:05,892 --> 00:37:07,765
If the rich aren't safe in
their gated communities,

567
00:37:07,765 --> 00:37:08,765
then who is?

568
00:37:09,633 --> 00:37:10,831
No one.

569
00:37:10,831 --> 00:37:12,516
Now we've aimed high this time,

570
00:37:12,516 --> 00:37:14,598
but we have to start finding replacements

571
00:37:14,598 --> 00:37:17,431
for the city and state
officials we've removed.

572
00:37:17,431 --> 00:37:19,702
Not some carbon copy
idiots taking their place,

573
00:37:19,702 --> 00:37:21,024
but our own people.

574
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:22,403
Our own trancers.

575
00:37:22,403 --> 00:37:25,986
(suspenseful music swells)

576
00:37:37,685 --> 00:37:39,379
Look, I know this is better
than livin' on the streets,

577
00:37:39,379 --> 00:37:41,333
but you don't wanna be tranced.

578
00:37:41,333 --> 00:37:43,468
They're frying your brains.

579
00:37:43,468 --> 00:37:47,739
They're teaching us to
stand up for ourselves.

580
00:37:47,739 --> 00:37:50,333
By killing on command?

581
00:37:50,333 --> 00:37:52,832
That's the kind of scum
bag who's been victimizing us

582
00:37:52,832 --> 00:37:54,324
our whole lives.

583
00:37:54,324 --> 00:37:55,606
Tell me, honey,

584
00:37:55,606 --> 00:37:58,198
how many of those little blue
devils have you eaten today?

585
00:37:58,198 --> 00:37:59,697
Oh, you're losin' 'em.

586
00:37:59,697 --> 00:38:01,454
Why not let it go?

587
00:38:01,454 --> 00:38:04,065
Because I know what kind of
crazy shit this will lead to.

588
00:38:04,065 --> 00:38:05,141
What?

589
00:38:05,141 --> 00:38:06,411
Have you got a crystal ball?

590
00:38:06,411 --> 00:38:08,190
Yeah, I've seen the future,

591
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:11,253
and it sucks unless we do
something about it now.

592
00:38:11,253 --> 00:38:13,495
Look, I know you're all
drugged or hypnotized.

593
00:38:13,495 --> 00:38:15,116
That sleazebag with the hot dog cart's

594
00:38:15,116 --> 00:38:18,173
probably been feedin' you crap
for months to soften you up.

595
00:38:18,173 --> 00:38:19,776
Sam is our friend.

596
00:38:19,776 --> 00:38:20,704
Look, you gotta get it together.

597
00:38:20,704 --> 00:38:22,899
This place is goin' up in flames,

598
00:38:22,899 --> 00:38:25,240
and I don't wanna see
innocent people buy it

599
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:27,101
for some trancing bitch.

600
00:38:27,101 --> 00:38:29,391
Now I can help you get
the hell out of here,

601
00:38:29,391 --> 00:38:31,224
but you gotta want it.

602
00:38:32,685 --> 00:38:34,278
You better give it up
before the guards come round

603
00:38:34,278 --> 00:38:36,361
with the bedtime feeding.

604
00:38:39,722 --> 00:38:42,064
(door creaks open)

605
00:38:42,064 --> 00:38:44,310
Where the hell are you goin'?

606
00:38:44,310 --> 00:38:45,393
Men's room.

607
00:38:49,975 --> 00:38:51,744
(knocking on door)

608
00:38:51,744 --> 00:38:53,844
(keys jingle)

609
00:38:53,844 --> 00:38:56,677
(toilet flushing)

610
00:39:05,435 --> 00:39:08,102
(phone dialing)

611
00:39:12,443 --> 00:39:13,526
Hey, it's me.

612
00:39:14,816 --> 00:39:17,733
Yeah, I've got something to report.

613
00:39:19,491 --> 00:39:20,808
Yeah, in the usual way.

614
00:39:20,808 --> 00:39:23,808
(suspenseful music)

615
00:40:15,488 --> 00:40:18,905
You did your job, now make your report.

616
00:40:25,213 --> 00:40:26,480
The girl was trying
to get the bunk house

617
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:29,582
to escape with her 'cause
she said the whole place

618
00:40:29,582 --> 00:40:31,467
was going up in flames.

619
00:40:31,467 --> 00:40:33,584
Now what did she mean by that?

620
00:40:33,584 --> 00:40:35,388
I don't know.

621
00:40:35,388 --> 00:40:37,287
I don't know, Miss Shauna.

622
00:40:37,287 --> 00:40:41,107
I kept her alive trusting you, Mark,

623
00:40:41,107 --> 00:40:44,037
to find out what she
knew so you can turn her.

624
00:40:44,037 --> 00:40:48,226
But then I've always had a
little doubt about your worth.

625
00:40:48,226 --> 00:40:50,333
Maybe I should just treat
you like the other me

626
00:40:50,333 --> 00:40:54,883
and put you in the trancing
beam just to be sure.

627
00:40:54,883 --> 00:40:57,036
Then we can never be together again.

628
00:40:57,036 --> 00:41:00,138
Well, you're very replaceable.

629
00:41:00,138 --> 00:41:01,668
You're lucky

630
00:41:01,668 --> 00:41:03,393
that I choose

631
00:41:03,393 --> 00:41:05,485
to tolerate you for now.

632
00:41:05,485 --> 00:41:08,485
(suspenseful music)

633
00:41:25,011 --> 00:41:28,178
(gentle guitar music)

634
00:41:48,675 --> 00:41:50,301
You see?

635
00:41:50,301 --> 00:41:52,781
They don't seem like they're
having such a bad time.

636
00:41:52,781 --> 00:41:54,969
Sure, they're all brain dead.

637
00:41:54,969 --> 00:41:56,735
It's better than the alternative.

638
00:41:56,735 --> 00:41:59,313
When you gonna wise up, babe?

639
00:41:59,313 --> 00:42:02,350
Son, you really don't know
who you're dealing with.

640
00:42:02,350 --> 00:42:05,350
I'd back off big time if I were you.

641
00:42:10,051 --> 00:42:12,801
(car doors shut)

642
00:42:15,054 --> 00:42:17,074
Surprised it took you so long to find it.

643
00:42:17,074 --> 00:42:19,907
It was right there in plain sight.

644
00:42:23,001 --> 00:42:26,084
Sorry to point out your shortcomings.

645
00:42:27,871 --> 00:42:29,621
She's getting away!

646
00:42:41,162 --> 00:42:42,618
Hey,

647
00:42:42,618 --> 00:42:44,368
you looking for this?

648
00:42:45,837 --> 00:42:48,170
Get your ass out of the car.

649
00:42:52,755 --> 00:42:54,190
(car door shuts)

650
00:42:54,190 --> 00:42:55,953
Miss Jo, what happened to the nice clothes

651
00:42:55,953 --> 00:42:57,914
and the nice attitude?

652
00:42:57,914 --> 00:42:59,944
Lady I knew would never play with guns.

653
00:42:59,944 --> 00:43:02,394
Lady you knew is gone, asshole.

654
00:43:02,394 --> 00:43:04,892
Pity, I liked her.

655
00:43:04,892 --> 00:43:07,488
I don't give a shit about you.

656
00:43:07,488 --> 00:43:10,488
(suspenseful music)

657
00:43:24,410 --> 00:43:25,569
Josephine,

658
00:43:25,569 --> 00:43:27,930
so you've changed your look.

659
00:43:27,930 --> 00:43:29,982
It's not very sophisticated though.

660
00:43:29,982 --> 00:43:32,113
I'll take that as a compliment, honey.

661
00:43:32,113 --> 00:43:33,611
How many of these kids have you killed?

662
00:43:33,611 --> 00:43:36,120
We are just helping a
lost and bitter generation

663
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:37,881
find a purpose.

664
00:43:37,881 --> 00:43:40,626
That little demonstration of
yours last night was lovely.

665
00:43:40,626 --> 00:43:42,274
When do they start eating brains?

666
00:43:42,274 --> 00:43:44,205
Don't worry, you'll
understand everything

667
00:43:44,205 --> 00:43:45,896
in just a few seconds.

668
00:43:45,896 --> 00:43:49,479
(suspenseful music swells)

669
00:44:00,279 --> 00:44:02,362
(lasers)

670
00:44:19,866 --> 00:44:21,783
You mousy little bitch.

671
00:44:22,817 --> 00:44:24,258
I don't know how you got here,

672
00:44:24,258 --> 00:44:26,509
but you are leaving on a mission

673
00:44:26,509 --> 00:44:27,701
'cause there's someone that we need

674
00:44:27,701 --> 00:44:29,783
to help us fight the scum of the world,

675
00:44:29,783 --> 00:44:33,108
and you're gonna get him for us.

676
00:44:33,108 --> 00:44:34,448
Say you understand me.

677
00:44:34,448 --> 00:44:36,377
I understand you.

678
00:44:36,377 --> 00:44:38,294
I live to do your will.

679
00:44:39,865 --> 00:44:41,273
To flourish in your shadow,

680
00:44:41,273 --> 00:44:45,291
to grovel at your feet like
the unworthy cur that I am.

681
00:44:45,291 --> 00:44:46,841
To wallow in your filth.

682
00:44:46,841 --> 00:44:47,995
That's enough!

683
00:44:47,995 --> 00:44:49,788
No, nothing's enough.

684
00:44:49,788 --> 00:44:53,822
God above all others,
master of all masters.

685
00:44:53,822 --> 00:44:57,572
Get her and two others
ready for transport.

686
00:44:58,619 --> 00:45:01,619
(suspenseful music)

687
00:45:03,421 --> 00:45:05,203
What task has the glorious Miss Shauna

688
00:45:05,203 --> 00:45:07,503
set us to this fine day,

689
00:45:07,503 --> 00:45:10,769
we who are so unworthy
we could never hope to...

690
00:45:10,769 --> 00:45:12,455
Will you shut up with that crap?

691
00:45:12,455 --> 00:45:14,152
There's the objective right over there.

692
00:45:14,152 --> 00:45:17,735
(suspenseful music swells)

693
00:45:35,788 --> 00:45:37,335
(car door shuts)

694
00:45:37,335 --> 00:45:40,335
(suspenseful music)

695
00:45:53,019 --> 00:45:54,195
Get out!

696
00:45:54,195 --> 00:45:56,284
I'm not afraid to use force.

697
00:45:56,284 --> 00:45:57,951
Good God, Josephine.

698
00:45:58,988 --> 00:46:00,953
What have they done to you?

699
00:46:00,953 --> 00:46:03,323
I have willingly been made a lowly drone

700
00:46:03,323 --> 00:46:06,169
to the splendid Miss Shauna.

701
00:46:06,169 --> 00:46:08,227
Man, you got her started again?

702
00:46:08,227 --> 00:46:11,041
(gunshot)

703
00:46:11,041 --> 00:46:13,871
(grunts)

704
00:46:13,871 --> 00:46:15,761
(kicks)

705
00:46:15,761 --> 00:46:18,761
(suspenseful music)

706
00:46:24,377 --> 00:46:26,212
(gunshot)

707
00:46:26,212 --> 00:46:29,406
(suspenseful music)

708
00:46:29,406 --> 00:46:31,483
(gunshot)

709
00:46:31,483 --> 00:46:34,150
(fire crackles)

710
00:46:35,823 --> 00:46:38,154
Good lord, Josephine,

711
00:46:38,154 --> 00:46:39,917
I thought you were with them.

712
00:46:39,917 --> 00:46:41,517
The important thing is they bought it.

713
00:46:41,517 --> 00:46:43,266
Now we gotta get you the hell out of here.

714
00:46:43,266 --> 00:46:46,266
(suspenseful music)

715
00:46:57,545 --> 00:47:00,230
One more step and
I'll blow his head off.

716
00:47:00,230 --> 00:47:01,730
Drop the gun, now!

717
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:11,250
(car door shuts)

718
00:47:11,250 --> 00:47:14,083
(machinery beeps)

719
00:47:20,336 --> 00:47:21,169
Come on, Jack.

720
00:47:21,169 --> 00:47:24,751
Kill this bastard so I can
bring you back up the line!

721
00:47:24,751 --> 00:47:27,168
(car engine)

722
00:47:37,846 --> 00:47:41,012
So how's the revolution goin', babe?

723
00:47:41,012 --> 00:47:43,012
(kicks)

724
00:47:45,791 --> 00:47:47,874
(laughs)

725
00:47:48,922 --> 00:47:51,339
(door opens)

726
00:47:52,261 --> 00:47:55,211
(door shuts)

727
00:47:55,211 --> 00:47:58,258
Josephine, what is all this?

728
00:47:58,258 --> 00:48:00,822
Why is this happening?

729
00:48:00,822 --> 00:48:02,971
'Cause this bunch of
assholes wants power.

730
00:48:02,971 --> 00:48:04,590
They think you can help them get it.

731
00:48:04,590 --> 00:48:05,630
They're wrong.

732
00:48:05,630 --> 00:48:06,764
I know.

733
00:48:06,764 --> 00:48:09,014
That's our ace in the hole.

734
00:48:10,778 --> 00:48:12,449
He didn't put up a fight at all.

735
00:48:12,449 --> 00:48:14,959
It's your ex-employee who's
causing all the problems.

736
00:48:14,959 --> 00:48:17,922
Now she's gone to enormous
lengths to protect Malvern.

737
00:48:17,922 --> 00:48:19,158
You might be able to use that.

738
00:48:19,158 --> 00:48:20,726
I know how to handle this.

739
00:48:20,726 --> 00:48:22,671
No, you'll leave a pile of corpses,

740
00:48:22,671 --> 00:48:24,335
and we won't be any closer to our goal.

741
00:48:24,335 --> 00:48:26,377
If Miss Forrest and
Malvern have a friendship,

742
00:48:26,377 --> 00:48:27,673
use it against them.

743
00:48:27,673 --> 00:48:28,907
Once Malvern is compliant,

744
00:48:28,907 --> 00:48:30,589
you can gut the girl for all I care,

745
00:48:30,589 --> 00:48:32,867
but if you kill her now, she's of no use.

746
00:48:32,867 --> 00:48:34,345
Those are my orders, Shauna.

747
00:48:34,345 --> 00:48:35,178
Yes sir.

748
00:48:41,267 --> 00:48:43,507
Good evening, doctor.

749
00:48:43,507 --> 00:48:46,604
Hope this hasn't been too
much of a trial for you.

750
00:48:46,604 --> 00:48:48,429
Except for the zombies
and the mass murders,

751
00:48:48,429 --> 00:48:49,509
it's been peachy.

752
00:48:49,509 --> 00:48:50,851
You're lucky you're still standing.

753
00:48:50,851 --> 00:48:53,514
I'd show a little bit more
respect if I were you.

754
00:48:53,514 --> 00:48:54,651
Yeah, Toots?

755
00:48:54,651 --> 00:48:56,114
Respect for what?

756
00:48:56,114 --> 00:48:58,970
The possibility of new world order,

757
00:48:58,970 --> 00:49:00,849
with your help, Doctor.

758
00:49:00,849 --> 00:49:02,606
Josephine told me.

759
00:49:02,606 --> 00:49:04,459
That's the meteor we tracked.

760
00:49:04,459 --> 00:49:06,042
Come take a look.

761
00:49:16,991 --> 00:49:18,663
What's it say?

762
00:49:18,663 --> 00:49:20,731
Less than 20 retins.

763
00:49:20,731 --> 00:49:23,199
Josephine, there's practically
no radiation at all.

764
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:24,456
See?

765
00:49:24,456 --> 00:49:26,618
No danger of contamination.

766
00:49:26,618 --> 00:49:27,879
Bullshit.

767
00:49:27,879 --> 00:49:29,886
What about the ray that thing gives off?

768
00:49:29,886 --> 00:49:33,179
Doctor, even though it has no radiation,

769
00:49:33,179 --> 00:49:37,173
this meteor has special
qualities that we have distilled,

770
00:49:37,173 --> 00:49:40,590
an energy force that alters human tissue,

771
00:49:41,971 --> 00:49:44,502
particularly those of the brain.

772
00:49:44,502 --> 00:49:45,778
What are you talking about?

773
00:49:45,778 --> 00:49:49,131
By focusing the energy
using this device,

774
00:49:49,131 --> 00:49:53,298
we're able to concentrate
the ray on the frontal lobes

775
00:49:56,006 --> 00:49:59,143
using the optical nerve
as a point of entry.

776
00:49:59,143 --> 00:50:01,226
(lasers)

777
00:50:04,781 --> 00:50:05,698
Good God.

778
00:50:06,665 --> 00:50:09,387
(grunting)

779
00:50:09,387 --> 00:50:11,245
What have you done to this child?

780
00:50:11,245 --> 00:50:13,271
Oh, this is just a demonstration,

781
00:50:13,271 --> 00:50:14,657
but you see the result.

782
00:50:14,657 --> 00:50:15,930
With certain drugs, we've been able

783
00:50:15,930 --> 00:50:18,528
to control the behavior of these subjects,

784
00:50:18,528 --> 00:50:22,258
evoke certain emotions,
and in this case, rage.

785
00:50:22,258 --> 00:50:23,171
Nothing like an army of killers

786
00:50:23,171 --> 00:50:25,677
to make your megalomaniacal day complete.

787
00:50:25,677 --> 00:50:28,240
That's why you're here.

788
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:30,137
I can't have anything to do with

789
00:50:30,137 --> 00:50:31,842
something so monstrous.

790
00:50:31,842 --> 00:50:34,822
These results are not our ultimate aim.

791
00:50:34,822 --> 00:50:38,431
This poor child's life
was over a long time ago.

792
00:50:38,431 --> 00:50:40,783
Don't feel sorry for her.

793
00:50:40,783 --> 00:50:44,126
(rapid gunfire)

794
00:50:44,126 --> 00:50:44,959
God.

795
00:50:49,378 --> 00:50:53,807
Doctor, we don't want
you to be a part of this.

796
00:50:53,807 --> 00:50:55,594
We want you to help us modify the beam

797
00:50:55,594 --> 00:50:58,578
so that the results are not that extreme.

798
00:50:58,578 --> 00:51:01,583
Examine the meteor, test its elements.

799
00:51:01,583 --> 00:51:05,750
I know that you can find a
key to harness this force.

800
00:51:06,938 --> 00:51:09,688
We don't want an army of killers.

801
00:51:10,864 --> 00:51:13,705
What do you expect from me?

802
00:51:13,705 --> 00:51:15,831
Your best efforts,

803
00:51:15,831 --> 00:51:17,807
or you friend is dead.

804
00:51:17,807 --> 00:51:20,408
Doc, don't listen to that
shit, and don't worry about me.

805
00:51:20,408 --> 00:51:22,149
I'm gonna kill all their trancing asses.

806
00:51:22,149 --> 00:51:23,794
(punches)

807
00:51:23,794 --> 00:51:26,276
(grunts)

808
00:51:26,276 --> 00:51:28,365
She's helpless.

809
00:51:28,365 --> 00:51:32,528
If you want her to live, then get to work.

810
00:51:32,528 --> 00:51:35,053
Come on, I want to show you something.

811
00:51:35,053 --> 00:51:35,886
Come on!

812
00:51:36,872 --> 00:51:39,705
You can't do anything for her now.

813
00:51:42,368 --> 00:51:43,994
We've been gathering these meteors

814
00:51:43,994 --> 00:51:46,888
since the first shower
started two years ago.

815
00:51:46,888 --> 00:51:48,427
I remember.

816
00:51:48,427 --> 00:51:50,667
I tracked it, I reported it.

817
00:51:50,667 --> 00:51:52,610
Only to us, Doctor.

818
00:51:52,610 --> 00:51:55,795
We've intercepted all
your reports since then.

819
00:51:55,795 --> 00:51:58,264
They led up to the very
first tiny pieces of energy

820
00:51:58,264 --> 00:52:00,560
scattered around the desert.

821
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:02,633
We saw the potential for
something very important

822
00:52:02,633 --> 00:52:05,318
in that rock and started experiments.

823
00:52:05,318 --> 00:52:06,755
The results are in here.

824
00:52:06,755 --> 00:52:09,755
(suspenseful music)

825
00:52:14,527 --> 00:52:16,333
We've had other scientists work with us

826
00:52:16,333 --> 00:52:19,358
on perfecting the trancing beam.

827
00:52:19,358 --> 00:52:22,659
The results, as you can see, have been,

828
00:52:22,659 --> 00:52:24,159
well, unfortunate.

829
00:52:28,148 --> 00:52:30,477
So all this human
misery's worth it, isn't it?

830
00:52:30,477 --> 00:52:32,966
Don't suddenly grow balls, Doctor.

831
00:52:32,966 --> 00:52:34,615
They don't fit you.

832
00:52:34,615 --> 00:52:35,968
Just do as your told,

833
00:52:35,968 --> 00:52:37,944
and you and the girl can walk out of here.

834
00:52:37,944 --> 00:52:39,669
Don't try my patience.

835
00:52:39,669 --> 00:52:41,796
If you haven't noticed, I don't have any.

836
00:52:41,796 --> 00:52:44,796
(suspenseful music)

837
00:53:00,081 --> 00:53:01,724
Jennings, if you can hear me,

838
00:53:01,724 --> 00:53:03,186
don't worry.

839
00:53:03,186 --> 00:53:07,353
My daughter ain't dyin'
like this, and neither am I.

840
00:53:14,075 --> 00:53:15,956
You got a problem, babe?

841
00:53:15,956 --> 00:53:18,467
Just talkin' to a friend up the line.

842
00:53:18,467 --> 00:53:22,486
I was tellin' him how sweet
it's gonna be to kill you.

843
00:53:22,486 --> 00:53:25,040
Don't think so, babe.

844
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:28,694
See, I've looked into my
future, and it's clear sailing.

845
00:53:28,694 --> 00:53:30,195
I've got somebody on the inside.

846
00:53:30,195 --> 00:53:31,028
No shit.

847
00:53:32,495 --> 00:53:35,205
Just don't count on them
to protect you from me.

848
00:53:35,205 --> 00:53:37,402
I'm shakin', babe.

849
00:53:37,402 --> 00:53:39,569
I'm the one on the inside.

850
00:53:46,726 --> 00:53:49,726
(suspenseful music)

851
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:30,590
(switches click)

852
00:54:33,226 --> 00:54:36,027
(machinery beeps)

853
00:54:36,027 --> 00:54:39,027
(suspenseful music)

854
00:54:53,824 --> 00:54:55,824
(thuds)

855
00:54:57,270 --> 00:55:00,512
I never seen one do that before, Doc.

856
00:55:00,512 --> 00:55:02,955
You need to try that again.

857
00:55:02,955 --> 00:55:05,538
Don't worry, we'll get this up.

858
00:55:10,586 --> 00:55:13,292
(suspenseful music)

859
00:55:13,292 --> 00:55:14,875
[Jo] Put me down.

860
00:55:19,960 --> 00:55:23,710
You know how this
works, Doctor, don't you?

861
00:55:25,582 --> 00:55:29,749
Complete the circuit, and
you get a real nice effect.

862
00:55:30,780 --> 00:55:32,259
(screams)

863
00:55:32,259 --> 00:55:33,708
Stop it!

864
00:55:33,708 --> 00:55:35,110
(grunts)

865
00:55:35,110 --> 00:55:36,241
Are you out of your mind?

866
00:55:36,241 --> 00:55:39,743
Failure won't be tolerated, Doctor!

867
00:55:39,743 --> 00:55:43,309
I gave you a job to do,
and I expect you to do it.

868
00:55:43,309 --> 00:55:45,948
One more test that doesn't work,

869
00:55:45,948 --> 00:55:47,645
and Miss Forrest...

870
00:55:47,645 --> 00:55:49,978
The name's Jo Deth, bitch.

871
00:55:50,819 --> 00:55:52,032
Deth, fine.

872
00:55:52,032 --> 00:55:53,329
How appropriate,

873
00:55:53,329 --> 00:55:55,502
and it won't be a pretty one, either,

874
00:55:55,502 --> 00:55:57,371
unless your friend cooperates.

875
00:55:57,371 --> 00:55:59,288
I won't let you down.

876
00:56:03,708 --> 00:56:05,958
Put her in the last cell.

877
00:56:10,178 --> 00:56:11,261
Enjoy yourself.

878
00:56:11,261 --> 00:56:14,261
(suspenseful music)

879
00:56:20,156 --> 00:56:21,728
I've singed trancers that make you guys

880
00:56:21,728 --> 00:56:23,786
look like choir boys.

881
00:56:23,786 --> 00:56:25,036
You're nothin'.

882
00:56:29,157 --> 00:56:29,990
OK,

883
00:56:31,028 --> 00:56:34,026
guess we're all in the
same shape here, huh?

884
00:56:34,026 --> 00:56:36,276
It's alright, I'm a friend.

885
00:56:42,965 --> 00:56:44,969
[Shauna] How do the targets look to you?

886
00:56:44,969 --> 00:56:47,684
Oh they're doable provided
we can replace them quickly

887
00:56:47,684 --> 00:56:48,984
with our own people.

888
00:56:48,984 --> 00:56:51,274
Oh that's being taken care of right now.

889
00:56:51,274 --> 00:56:54,367
Now, Malvern has given
you nothing but failures.

890
00:56:54,367 --> 00:56:57,057
Assassins are fine, but we
need intelligent subjects

891
00:56:57,057 --> 00:56:58,120
we can control.

892
00:56:58,120 --> 00:57:00,670
His background makes
him perfect for this,

893
00:57:00,670 --> 00:57:03,843
and let's just say I gave
him a little incentive.

894
00:57:03,843 --> 00:57:05,365
I know we want to put
one of our own in power

895
00:57:05,365 --> 00:57:07,032
as soon as possible.

896
00:57:07,938 --> 00:57:09,688
I have the candidate.

897
00:57:11,625 --> 00:57:13,255
We don't even have to trance this one

898
00:57:13,255 --> 00:57:15,661
to get him to do what we want,

899
00:57:15,661 --> 00:57:18,156
but treatments would modify his behavior

900
00:57:18,156 --> 00:57:21,156
and give us a chance to educate him.

901
00:57:22,571 --> 00:57:23,912
I can see him running for office.

902
00:57:23,912 --> 00:57:26,412
Oh, I could see him winning.

903
00:57:27,607 --> 00:57:30,041
Have your eyes on being the first lady?

904
00:57:30,041 --> 00:57:31,635
I'm not that ambitious, sir.

905
00:57:31,635 --> 00:57:34,296
I'll settle for assisting you.

906
00:57:34,296 --> 00:57:35,713
How comforting.

907
00:57:37,891 --> 00:57:40,173
(hammering)

908
00:57:40,173 --> 00:57:43,173
(suspenseful music)

909
00:57:47,788 --> 00:57:50,497
(liquids bubbling)

910
00:57:50,497 --> 00:57:53,497
(suspenseful music)

911
00:58:04,496 --> 00:58:05,960
(knocking on door)

912
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:07,950
Josephine, can you hear me?

913
00:58:07,950 --> 00:58:08,978
Yeah.

914
00:58:08,978 --> 00:58:09,978
Take this.

915
00:58:10,938 --> 00:58:13,706
Believe it or not, I found
a good use for this thing.

916
00:58:13,706 --> 00:58:15,888
With the proper filters,

917
00:58:15,888 --> 00:58:18,781
it will greatly reduce your healing time.

918
00:58:18,781 --> 00:58:20,400
Put the salve on your wounds

919
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:23,400
and dress them with a sterile gauze.

920
00:58:25,535 --> 00:58:26,943
[Jo] Thanks, Doc.

921
00:58:26,943 --> 00:58:29,677
For once, I'm gonna rescue you.

922
00:58:29,677 --> 00:58:32,677
(suspenseful music)

923
00:58:46,381 --> 00:58:47,214
Thanks.

924
00:58:50,423 --> 00:58:53,506
(inaudible dialogue)

925
00:58:59,556 --> 00:59:02,383
(car door shuts)

926
00:59:02,383 --> 00:59:04,489
I think I found something
to meet your requirements.

927
00:59:04,489 --> 00:59:05,559
How so?

928
00:59:05,559 --> 00:59:07,363
I broke down the base
elements of the meteor

929
00:59:07,363 --> 00:59:09,508
and found substances that will filter out

930
00:59:09,508 --> 00:59:11,791
certain types of the energy it gives off.

931
00:59:11,791 --> 00:59:13,453
The dosage of the ray can be controlled

932
00:59:13,453 --> 00:59:15,421
so you can simply break a man's will

933
00:59:15,421 --> 00:59:19,500
or turn him into a raving
animal, your choice.

934
00:59:19,500 --> 00:59:22,805
Since I need to have it
operate at its mildest level,

935
00:59:22,805 --> 00:59:25,341
I think Josephine would be
a perfect choice, don't you?

936
00:59:25,341 --> 00:59:27,427
I mean it can't hurt her much.

937
00:59:27,427 --> 00:59:29,267
That's not the deal we talked about.

938
00:59:29,267 --> 00:59:32,158
I don't remember
having that conversation.

939
00:59:32,158 --> 00:59:35,774
In fact, I don't think
that it ever took place.

940
00:59:35,774 --> 00:59:38,774
(suspenseful music)

941
00:59:44,784 --> 00:59:46,951
You know your shit, Doc.

942
00:59:58,632 --> 01:00:00,215
Here, this'll help.

943
01:00:12,811 --> 01:00:14,519
With this gift from the stars,

944
01:00:14,519 --> 01:00:17,925
I can give you strength and power.

945
01:00:17,925 --> 01:00:20,291
Sometimes we need a brute
force to deal with the scum

946
01:00:20,291 --> 01:00:22,707
who control our lives,

947
01:00:22,707 --> 01:00:25,782
and other times, we
need the power of mind.

948
01:00:25,782 --> 01:00:29,155
Now we have a choice as to
which direction we will go

949
01:00:29,155 --> 01:00:32,331
in order for our voice to
be heard in this world,

950
01:00:32,331 --> 01:00:33,947
and I ask you, children,

951
01:00:33,947 --> 01:00:35,729
do you want a voice?

952
01:00:35,729 --> 01:00:36,951
[Both] Yes.

953
01:00:36,951 --> 01:00:38,203
[Both] Yes.

954
01:00:38,203 --> 01:00:40,370
I ask it again,

955
01:00:40,370 --> 01:00:44,565
do you want a voice to
be heard in this world?

956
01:00:44,565 --> 01:00:48,093
Not the cries of some weak victims,

957
01:00:48,093 --> 01:00:50,093
but someone of strength,

958
01:00:51,456 --> 01:00:52,873
of body and mind.

959
01:00:53,734 --> 01:00:55,839
Someone with true power.

960
01:00:55,839 --> 01:00:57,465
[All] Yes.

961
01:00:57,465 --> 01:00:58,798
Yes, we want it.

962
01:00:59,908 --> 01:01:04,712
Then you all have your
chance in the transformer,

963
01:01:04,712 --> 01:01:08,095
and you'll have the honors of being first.

964
01:01:08,095 --> 01:01:10,762
Doctor Malvern, you may proceed.

965
01:01:19,852 --> 01:01:20,685
Uh uh,

966
01:01:20,685 --> 01:01:24,852
you prepare the meteor,
I'll administer the dosage,

967
01:01:26,949 --> 01:01:28,751
and this better work.

968
01:01:28,751 --> 01:01:30,168
It should work.

969
01:01:32,944 --> 01:01:33,777
Now!

970
01:01:33,777 --> 01:01:35,736
(punches)

971
01:01:35,736 --> 01:01:37,903
(screams)

972
01:01:42,481 --> 01:01:44,028
(lasers)

973
01:01:44,028 --> 01:01:46,695
(crowd screams)

974
01:01:51,325 --> 01:01:53,974
(rapid gunfire)

975
01:01:53,974 --> 01:01:56,974
(suspenseful music)

976
01:01:59,985 --> 01:02:01,638

977
01:02:01,638 --> 01:02:03,885

978
01:02:03,885 --> 01:02:06,885
(suspenseful music)

979
01:02:12,760 --> 01:02:15,580
(glass breaks)

980
01:02:15,580 --> 01:02:16,413
(gunshot)

981
01:02:16,413 --> 01:02:19,413

(suspenseful music)

990

(suspenseful music)

1015
01:05:46,496 --> 01:05:47,678
Hey.

1016
01:05:47,678 --> 01:05:48,652
(punches)

1017
01:05:48,652 --> 01:05:50,653

(screaming)

1029
01:07:18,084 --> 01:07:20,751
Welcome to your future, asshole.

1030
01:07:25,697 --> 01:07:27,232
(door slams)

1031
01:07:27,232 --> 01:07:30,232
(suspenseful music)

1032
01:07:54,473 --> 01:07:56,640

1033
01:07:58,317 --> 01:08:00,900

(punches)

1038
01:08:18,188 --> 01:08:19,262
You traitor.

1039
01:08:19,262 --> 01:08:23,356
Don't you know she's
offering us the world?

1040
01:08:23,356 --> 01:08:25,359
I won't let you take that away.

1041
01:08:25,359 --> 01:08:28,359
(suspenseful music)

1042
01:08:42,552 --> 01:08:44,219
You whimp ass bitch.

1043
01:08:46,536 --> 01:08:48,619
(lasers)

1044
01:08:50,165 --> 01:08:53,165

(birds chirping)

1055
01:10:52,989 --> 01:10:55,153
You would have been
proud of me, Josephine.

1056
01:10:55,153 --> 01:10:56,934
I didn't lose my nerve.

1057
01:10:56,934 --> 01:11:00,767
I came close, but I
singed that whimp ass Sam.

1058
01:11:01,637 --> 01:11:03,072
I'm always proud of you,

1059
01:11:03,072 --> 01:11:05,108
and you did a hell of a
lot more than that, Doc.

1060
01:11:05,108 --> 01:11:06,275
Saved my life.

1061
01:11:08,076 --> 01:11:10,157
(stabs)

1062
01:11:10,157 --> 01:11:12,907

(punches)

1070
01:11:54,210 --> 01:11:57,210
(suspenseful music)

1071
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:06,416
Why did you come here?

1072
01:12:06,416 --> 01:12:09,773
To stop you from killing my daughter,

1073
01:12:09,773 --> 01:12:12,356
me, and thousands just like me.

1074
01:12:13,252 --> 01:12:15,335
(lasers)

1075
01:12:20,507 --> 01:12:21,340
Oh gees.

1076
01:12:25,456 --> 01:12:26,456
Take this.

1077
01:12:28,970 --> 01:12:30,822
Use what you need,

1078
01:12:30,822 --> 01:12:34,822
and turn the rest over
to a research laboratory.

1079
01:12:35,759 --> 01:12:38,166
It would be nice if they gave me credit

1080
01:12:38,166 --> 01:12:40,761
in the scientific journals.

1081
01:12:40,761 --> 01:12:42,128
Don't worry, Doc,

1082
01:12:42,128 --> 01:12:44,961
you're gonna do all that yourself.

1083
01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:54,848
How come when it's over there's
always one body too many?

1084
01:12:54,848 --> 01:12:57,598
(dramatic music)

1085
01:13:25,271 --> 01:13:27,604

1087
01:13:42,541 --> 01:13:45,541
(car engine starts)

1088
01:13:47,435 --> 01:13:50,268
(machinery beeps)

1089
01:13:53,241 --> 01:13:55,396
I didn't think your
kid could handle this,

1090
01:13:55,396 --> 01:13:56,930
but I was wrong.

1091
01:13:56,930 --> 01:13:58,639
You make a great team.

1092
01:13:58,639 --> 01:13:59,728
Jack, just give me the word

1093
01:13:59,728 --> 01:14:01,941
and I'll bring you back up the line.

1094
01:14:01,941 --> 01:14:04,858
(machinery shreds)

1095
01:14:08,097 --> 01:14:10,680

1096
01:14:14,912 --> 01:14:17,829
(machinery shreds)

1097

(elevator dings)

1098
01:14:29,204 --> 01:14:30,381
Did you know that being an asshole

1099
01:14:30,381 --> 01:14:35,167
is the leading cause of
death in both men and women?

1100
01:14:35,167 --> 01:14:38,084
Give me my smokes and hit the road.

1101
01:14:43,425 --> 01:14:46,342
(machinery shreds)

1102
01:14:49,322 --> 01:14:52,488
(suspenseful music)

1103
01:14:52,488 --> 01:14:55,405
(machinery shreds)

1104
01:15:00,987 --> 01:15:03,320
(heartbeat)

1105
01:15:20,495 --> 01:15:21,869
You know,

1106
01:15:21,869 --> 01:15:25,602
I never thought of you as
anything but a repressed,

1107
01:15:25,602 --> 01:15:28,352
stuck up, bookish little nothing.

1108
01:15:30,448 --> 01:15:32,114
Never underestimate anybody

1109
01:15:32,114 --> 01:15:34,111
whose last name is really Deth.

1110
01:15:34,111 --> 01:15:35,030
Oh, I know that now.

1111
01:15:35,030 --> 01:15:37,398
Your name is very well
known to my associates.

1112
01:15:37,398 --> 01:15:39,396
The others behind trancing, you mean.

1113
01:15:39,396 --> 01:15:40,229
Maybe.

1114
01:15:42,749 --> 01:15:46,074
There are hundreds of us,
and we control thousands,

1115
01:15:46,074 --> 01:15:49,407
so killing me actually gets you nothing.

1116
01:15:50,290 --> 01:15:51,844
Wrong,

1117
01:15:51,844 --> 01:15:53,594
it gets my rocks off.

1118
01:15:55,322 --> 01:15:58,439
(two gunshots)

1119
01:15:58,439 --> 01:16:00,606
(gunshot)

1120
01:16:02,717 --> 01:16:05,467
(fire crackling)

1121
01:16:09,077 --> 01:16:11,333
(futuristic whoosh)

1122
01:16:11,333 --> 01:16:14,166
(liquid bubbling)

1123
01:16:16,960 --> 01:16:20,877
Goddamn aliens, smell
even worse when they die.

1124
01:16:34,218 --> 01:16:35,932
You've had quite a night.

1125
01:16:35,932 --> 01:16:40,194
Wanna make it complete
and come back up the line?

1126
01:16:40,194 --> 01:16:43,633
Jennings, did you know
Castle was a stinkin' alien?

1127
01:16:43,633 --> 01:16:46,087
We had no information about him on file.

1128
01:16:46,087 --> 01:16:49,650
Since he was using the
meteor energy, though.

1129
01:16:49,650 --> 01:16:52,233
Probably brought it with him.

1130
01:16:53,438 --> 01:16:55,195
You saved your daughter.

1131
01:16:55,195 --> 01:16:58,006
That was the mission, and you did it.

1132
01:16:58,006 --> 01:17:00,506
No, this mission isn't over.

1133
01:17:02,636 --> 01:17:04,756
Castle said there's
hundreds more like him,

1134
01:17:04,756 --> 01:17:07,335
thousands more trancers,
aliens, whatever they are,

1135
01:17:07,335 --> 01:17:08,291
I'm ready for action.

1136
01:17:08,291 --> 01:17:09,882
You're goin' after all of them?

1137
01:17:09,882 --> 01:17:12,264
That's the job description, Ace.

1138
01:17:12,264 --> 01:17:14,001
Jack, you're a colossal pain in the ass,

1139
01:17:14,001 --> 01:17:16,713
but you're one hell of a trancer hunter.

1140
01:17:16,713 --> 01:17:18,230
You'll see me back up the line.

1141
01:17:18,230 --> 01:17:19,445
When?

1142
01:17:19,445 --> 01:17:20,461
When I know it's safe for my daughter

1143
01:17:20,461 --> 01:17:22,628
to have her own life back.

1144
01:17:24,996 --> 01:17:26,897
I've always figured that
the only jobs worth doing

1145
01:17:26,897 --> 01:17:29,045
are the ones worth dying for.

1146
01:17:29,045 --> 01:17:32,402
That's not for everybody,
especially my kid.

1147
01:17:32,402 --> 01:17:33,904
Scumbags are lookin' for her now,

1148
01:17:33,904 --> 01:17:36,858
so I've gotta stay right
here to strike at them first.

1149
01:17:36,858 --> 01:17:38,745
My name's Jack,

1150
01:17:38,745 --> 01:17:39,578
Jo Deth,

1151
01:17:40,531 --> 01:17:42,287
and I'm a trancer hunter.

1152
01:17:42,287 --> 01:17:44,309
As I look out on the
sea of faces around me,

1153
01:17:44,309 --> 01:17:46,127
I wonder how many of 'em are regular folks

1154
01:17:46,127 --> 01:17:48,682
and how many of 'em are
ready to trance out.

1155
01:17:48,682 --> 01:17:50,702
My job is to find out.

1156
01:17:50,702 --> 01:17:54,369
Trancers, not really
alive, not dead enough,

1157
01:17:55,412 --> 01:17:57,247
until I'm through with 'em.

1158
01:17:57,247 --> 01:18:00,247
(suspenseful music)
