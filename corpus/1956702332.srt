1
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:33,840
Hayley?

2
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,240
Hayley!

3
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,360
Hayley!

4
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:06,800
Where... Where's Leo?

5
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,920
- Dr. Broderick?
- Dr. Hovey.

6
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,160
So glad you could come. I'm told
you're an expert in infectious diseases.

7
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:56,600
- What do we have here?
- I've never seen anything like it.

8
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:00,360
He came in unconscious with his limbs
stiffened as if they were in spasm.

9
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:03,560
His pulmonary edema keeps getting worse.
Kidney function is deteriorating.

10
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,880
Have you ever seen anything like it?

11
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,680
- Actually, I have.
- Oh, good. Where?

12
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:14,680
Few days ago, a guy was dropped off
outside an emergency room in Oxnard.

13
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,920
Turned out to be some sort of mobster
or something.

14
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,440
He had the exact same symptoms.

15
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,280
- So, how do we treat it?
- No idea.

16
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,240
He died a couple hours after arrival.

17
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,160
Sorry.

18
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,600
- Here you go, sweetie.
- Thanks, Dad.

19
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,256
Hayley,
where did you even come from?

20
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,680
I don't remember.

21
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:45,920
I crawled from a tunnel over there.

22
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,640
A tunnel? Uh, this whole time,
we thought you were in the cave.

23
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,160
I was.

24
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:53,800
- How?
- There must have been some lower cave.

25
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,240
Did you know about this?

26
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:59,520
It's probably a natural cavern
that wasn't connected to the cave we knew

27
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,560
until the first blast made an opening.

28
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:04,096
I tried to yell to stop the drilling,
but no one could hear me.

29
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:08,520
Then I saw an opening in the rocks,
and I crawled in just as it collapsed.

30
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:11,320
- Then I was free.
- Like a prison break.

31
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,680
Mom, where's Leo?

32
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,360
Oh, honey, he's, uh...
he's in the hospital.

33
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,240
What? But I thought he got out.

34
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:24,080
He did, but, uh... he's sick.

35
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,840
He contracted some sort of virus.

36
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,920
But he's gonna be okay, right?

37
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,680
I wanna go there. Please. Now.

38
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:44,360
I don't know, Dad.
They're not telling us anything.

39
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,896
There are tons of stories
of people

40
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,240
who were found alive
after days under rubble.

41
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:51,400
The earthquake in Haiti,
the tsunami in Asia.

42
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,720
Yeah, well, for every story like those,

43
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,360
there are a hundred stories
of people who didn't make it.

44
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,240
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

45
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:02,480
Why you gotta be so negative?
Sophie's trying to give us some hope here.

46
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,520
It's gonna be okay, all right?

47
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:15,120
- Alex, are you okay?
- What's going on?

48
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,960
We found Hayley.

49
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,279
She's okay.

50
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,880
I knew it.
I knew she'd make it.

51
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,216
- Thank God.
- Where is she? Is she okay?

52
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,456
- Is she okay? She's coming back?
- She's still in the hospital.

53
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,160
Wait, so,
how did you get her out?

54
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:36,840
Drilling team. She was under
about 100 tons of rock.

55
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,560
Interesting.

56
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:47,280
- The girl's alive.
- Really?

57
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,760
That's... good.

58
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:55,040
- What about Leo?
- I don't know. Dying, I guess?

59
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,160
What's wrong?

60
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,680
You said we could do this
without hurting innocent people.

61
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:05,000
Well, did we force that idiot
into the cave? No.

62
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:10,000
Okay.
Maybe this will cheer you up.

63
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:27,120
A pure extract of our
little virus, straight from the magnetite.

64
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:30,960
Like fresh-squeezed orange juice.

65
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,480
- What are you gonna do with it?
- Well...

66
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,320
your dad's famous tech conference
is two weeks away.

67
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:41,440
I mean, where else would you find
ten billionaires under one roof?

68
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:46,400
- You're gonna infect my dad?
- Maybe, if he doesn't pay up.

69
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:50,600
But thanks to that poor boy, everyone
will have heard about the virus by then.

70
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:54,840
I think it'll make their wallets
open a lot faster.

71
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,520
- Can I get you anything?
- No, Mom, thanks.

72
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,880
I just really wanna see him.

73
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,560
Hayley, he's unconscious.
Potentially contagious.

74
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,840
We know so little about what he has.

75
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,360
You, however, really do seem fine.

76
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,840
What?

77
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:20,880
Our biggest fear was that
you might have the same virus as Leo.

78
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,600
That's why we tried so hard to get you
out of there as soon as possible.

79
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:27,680
I actually think
I did have that virus.

80
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:32,560
- What do you mean?
- Well, most of the time, I was passed out.

81
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,400
But when I woke up...

82
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:41,280
I felt groggy.
I could barely move my body.

83
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,920
- I felt frozen.
- Really? So, how are you...

84
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I don't know.

85
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:49,520
I fell back asleep and then,
when I woke up again, I felt better.

86
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,320
Think, Hayley. Was there anything you saw,

87
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,840
or did or touched
that might have helped you?

88
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,600
- There was a mouse.
- A mouse?

89
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:03,600
And water!
It... it showed me to the water,

90
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,680
- and I drank it.
- What water?

91
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:10,360
I don't know. There was just
a pool of water on the ground.

92
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,840
And it was also dripping
on the rocks, too.

93
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:13,920
That might be it.

94
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:17,280
You said the magnetite
was in this cave, correct?

95
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:21,440
I wonder if somehow
the earth and rocks reacted to it,

96
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,960
and over the thousands of the years,

97
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,280
formed some sort of
an antidote to the virus.

98
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,840
The water could have been filled with it.

99
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,920
That's great! We need to get Leo
to drink some of that water.

100
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,560
There's no way.
The second explosion buried everything.

101
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,720
It's completely caved in.

102
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,920
Damn.

103
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,280
I don't think we need that water at all.

104
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,640
The antidote to the virus
might be right here in this room.

105
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,960
What? Me?

106
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,000
I think so.

107
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:56,600
We can take bone marrow from you
and transplant it into Leo's blood.

108
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:00,200
I'll have to consult
with some of my colleagues about this.

109
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,520
Wait, Dr. Hovey.

110
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,080
Do you think I could save him?

111
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:10,640
I don't know. But it's the only chance
we have right now.

112
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,000
Excuse me.

113
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,920
I should call Alex.

114
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:30,360
- Bone marrow? What would that do?
- I don't know.

115
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:33,080
Bone marrow is a blood cell factory.

116
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:36,280
If Hayley was cured from the virus,
her new blood cells would be immune to it.

117
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:39,080
If they can put her bone marrow
into Leo's body in time,

118
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,280
he'll start fighting the virus, too.

119
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,840
What do you mean, "if"?

120
00:08:44,919 --> 00:08:48,520
Bone marrow transplants are complicated.
A million things could go wrong.

121
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,040
Dad!

122
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,560
Hi, honey.

123
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,720
- Hi, everybody.
- Hey, Louis.

124
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,480
- Did you hear the news?
- Yeah, I just talked to Ryan.

125
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:07,000
We all need to send Leo some good vibes.

126
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:08,800
Yeah.

127
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:14,320
And then I asked Ryan how Leo and Hayley
got into the cave in the first place.

128
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,600
She said I should ask my daughter.

129
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:24,120
I'll never forgive myself
for not going in there instead of you.

130
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:29,080
We would have just been
in reverse positions, Daniel.

131
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:32,760
- It's not your fault.
- I could tell something was wrong.

132
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:36,320
I... I tried to look for you, but then...

133
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,680
Brooke and I got stuck
in that secret room.

134
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:42,760
Oh, God, Hayley, when you showed up...

135
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:46,640
I thought I was
dreaming or something.

136
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,400
Don't talk to me about dreams.

137
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,640
Why?

138
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,000
Well, when I was in the cave, I had...

139
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,080
Leo's about to go into surgery.
We're ready for you, Hayley.

140
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,080
Okay.

141
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:05,480
So, there are two ways
we can extract the blood cells.

142
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:09,200
One is quick, but because of your allergy
to lidocaine, it will be very painful.

143
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:13,400
The other one is slower,
but it won't hurt nearly as much.

144
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,480
The quick one.

145
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:18,240
- Hayley...
- Let's do it. Whatever it takes.

146
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,640
Let's save him.

147
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,040
Okay.

148
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,760
- Brooke, I don't think we should be here.
- Trust me.

149
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:10,200
Honey, if you wanna
do this another way...

150
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,920
No. Just do it.

151
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,920
Okay, Hayley. Hang on, okay?

152
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,560
I'm gonna count to three.

153
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,720
One...

154
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,600
two...

155
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:31,240
three.

156
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,720
I don't know what to say.

157
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:37,480
He must have built it
right under our noses during renovation.

158
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:41,160
Under my nose, you mean.
You were ten years old.

159
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:47,080
Do you think he was working
with Judy way back then?

160
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,320
I don't...

161
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,640
We should find him.

162
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,936
- Who knows what else he's done?
- To be honest, Brooke,

163
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:57,360
finding him is the last thing I wanna do
right now. How could I miss this?

164
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:01,880
- What kind of a father doesn't...
- Daddy. You're a great father.

165
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,960
And here I thought
everything was finally okay.

166
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:09,240
I was enjoying my time off. I was enjoying
getting ready for the tech conference.

167
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:12,320
- And this?
- But this isn't your fault.

168
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:14,960
Isn't it?

169
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,040
If it wasn't for this room,

170
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:20,600
Leo wouldn't be in a hospital,
fighting for his life.

171
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,640
Oh, honey.

172
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,056
We're done.

173
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,880
Your daughter is a hero.

174
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:44,040
- Thank you, Hayley.
- We need you. Now.

175
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,160
Hey.

176
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,720
- Daniel, what's going on?
- I don't know.

177
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:58,080
He's crashing.

178
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,280
Start CPR.

179
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:03,840
Okay, compressions.
Ventilation. Get the epi ready.

180
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,040
Ten.

181
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:14,320
- What happened?
- While they were prepping Leo for surgery,

182
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,880
he went into
multiple organ failure.

183
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,560
What does that mean?

184
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:20,760
It means every system in his body
is shutting down.

185
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:24,760
Cardiovascular, renal, pulmonary, hepatic.

186
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,000
It's not good.

187
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,720
Charging. Clear.

188
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,800
Charging. Clear.

189
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,280
Epi!

190
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,200
Come on, Leo. Come on.

191
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,120
We're not losing him.

192
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:49,040
- He's not dying, right? He can't die!
- No. No. No. No.

193
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,560
He can't die, Mom!

194
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:55,160
- No.
- It's gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay.

195
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,240
Clear!

196
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,640
Compressions, again. Come on, Leo!

197
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:09,280
- One, two, three, four.
- Okay, stop for a second.

198
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:10,920
Epi.

199
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,200
Check his pulse.

200
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:19,280
- Nothing.
- Compressions, again.

201
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,880
I was sure he was gonna be okay.

202
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,280
It was supposed to be a miracle.

203
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:36,760
How did he get this damn virus anyway?

204
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,840
The magnetite.

205
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:41,960
What?

206
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:45,040
The magnetite, it...
it emits a virus when it's heated.

207
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:49,200
- How the hell do you know that?
- This guy knows everything.

208
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,680
Actually, it's...

209
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,840
something the four of us
discovered recently.

210
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,920
- You remember Enzo?
- The groundskeeper?

211
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,720
He stole the magnetite Ryan gave us.

212
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:02,560
What?

213
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:06,120
Then it got heated by some guy
at a campfire and made him sick.

214
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,360
It almost got us, too,
when we tried to get it back.

215
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,960
You guys knew about this,
and you didn't tell my mom?

216
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:16,040
We did. The night the cave collapsed.

217
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,360
So that's why my mom told Murphy
to move faster.

218
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,680
- Nothing.
- Compressions, again.

219
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,720
One, two, three,
four, five, six, seven, eight.

220
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,720
Wait, Max.

221
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:46,080
We know that heat
activates the virus, right?

222
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,920
- What if...
- Cooling deactivates it.

223
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,720
- What, so you think...
- Oh, my God.

224
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,440
We need to call the doctors now!

225
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:06,200
Dr. Hovey! Dr. Hovey!

226
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:08,800
Get his pulse.

227
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:11,736
- Look, I need to talk to Dr. Hovey.
- No. I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

228
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,856
- You can't be in here.
- But we think we know what can save Leo.

229
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:16,760
- Let me talk to Dr. Hovey.
- Nurse, what does he want?

230
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:19,160
Dr. Hovey, the...
the virus is caused by heat.

231
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:22,520
We think you need to...
to cool Leo down to slow it down.

232
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:25,840
- How does he know that?
- There's no time to explain. Just do it!

233
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,240
Get some ice in here, now!

234
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:32,960
Come on, ice him down.

235
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,536
I don't understand this at all.

236
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:38,520
If we can lower his body temperature,
we might be able to weaken the virus,

237
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:41,440
- and then we can get the antibody in him.
- If we don't lose him first.

238
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,360
If we don't lose him.

239
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,880
Charging. Clear.

240
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,319
Charge to 200.

241
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:52,560
Your idea of cooling down
his body, well...

242
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:00,080
- it saved Leo's life.
- Oh, my God.

243
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,336
Leo's systems
are all starting to work again.

244
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:05,000
It'll be a while before he's off
all of those machines,

245
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:07,360
but his body is reacting well
to the antibody.

246
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,680
Thanks to you, Hayley.

247
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,640
Thank you.

248
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,040
Leo made it.

249
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:21,560
What?

250
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:25,400
Oh, my God. This is the best news
I've heard in my entire life!

251
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,600
Do you know what helped save Leo's life?

252
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,520
It was Ravens and Eagles working together.

253
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,680
I'm so proud of you kids.

254
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,480
Hey, Cruz.

255
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:13,720
You'd do anything
to get out of class, wouldn't you?
