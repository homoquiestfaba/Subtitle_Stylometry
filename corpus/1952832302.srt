1
00:00:43,084 --> 00:00:45,372
<i>Once upon a time, a long time ago,</i>

2
00:00:45,544 --> 00:00:49,044
<i>a king and queen had a</i>
<i>beautiful daughter named Fiona.</i>

3
00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:51,919
<i>But she was possessed</i>
<i>by a terrible curse.</i>

4
00:00:52,092 --> 00:00:56,719
<i>By day, a lovely princess.</i>
<i>By night, a hideous ogre.</i>

5
00:00:56,889 --> 00:00:59,641
<i>Only true love's kiss</i>
<i>could lift her curse.</i>

6
00:00:59,808 --> 00:01:03,972
<i>So Fiona waited in a tower,</i>
<i>guarded by a dragon, until the day</i>

7
00:01:04,146 --> 00:01:06,851
<i>when her true love would arrive.</i>

8
00:01:07,024 --> 00:01:09,349
<i>But as the days turned into years,</i>

9
00:01:09,526 --> 00:01:13,476
<i>the King and Queen were forced</i>
<i>to resort to more desperate measures.</i>

10
00:02:05,373 --> 00:02:07,117
Whoa, there.

11
00:02:08,376 --> 00:02:10,203
I don't know about this, Lillian.

12
00:02:10,378 --> 00:02:14,708
Fairy Godmother said only true love's
kiss could break Fiona's curse.

13
00:02:14,925 --> 00:02:19,171
I don't trust that woman, Harold.
This may be our last hope.

14
00:02:19,346 --> 00:02:22,465
Besides, he does come
highly recommended by King Midas.

15
00:02:22,641 --> 00:02:27,267
But to put our daughter's life
in the hands of this... person?

16
00:02:27,437 --> 00:02:32,146
He's devious.
He's deceitful. He's, he's...

17
00:02:32,317 --> 00:02:34,689
Rumpelstiltskin!

18
00:02:38,531 --> 00:02:40,073
Mrs. Highness.

19
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:42,111
How do you do?

20
00:02:44,037 --> 00:02:45,780
Down, Fifi. Get down!

21
00:02:47,373 --> 00:02:50,291
As you can see, everything's in order.

22
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:54,160
So you'll put an end
to our daughter's curse?

23
00:02:54,339 --> 00:02:58,668
And, in return, you sign the kingdom
of Far Far Away over to me.

24
00:03:04,724 --> 00:03:08,887
- Lillian, this is madness!
- What choice do we have?

25
00:03:09,062 --> 00:03:12,596
Fiona has been locked away
in that tower far too long.

26
00:03:12,774 --> 00:03:14,850
It's not like she's getting any younger.

27
00:03:15,026 --> 00:03:17,695
But to sign over our entire kingdom?

28
00:03:17,862 --> 00:03:20,779
Well, if your kingdom's worth
more to you than your daughter...

29
00:03:20,948 --> 00:03:24,566
Nothing is worth more to us
than our daughter.

30
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,575
Jump, Fifi, jump!

31
00:03:35,755 --> 00:03:39,587
Just sign it and all your problems
will disappear.

32
00:03:49,268 --> 00:03:52,602
Your Highness! The Princess!
She's been saved!

33
00:03:57,610 --> 00:03:59,104
Who saved her?

34
00:03:59,862 --> 00:04:02,649
<i>No one would have guessed</i>
<i>that an ogre named Shrek,</i>

35
00:04:02,823 --> 00:04:04,899
<i>whose roar was feared</i>
<i>throughout the land,</i>

36
00:04:05,075 --> 00:04:07,745
<i>would save the beautiful Princess Fiona.</i>

37
00:04:07,912 --> 00:04:10,865
<i>True love's kiss led to marriage</i>
<i>and ogre babies!</i>

38
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,159
<i>The kingdom of Far Far Away</i>
<i>was finally at peace.</i>

39
00:04:14,335 --> 00:04:18,712
<i>Goody for them!</i>
<i>And they lived happily ever after!</i>

40
00:04:20,299 --> 00:04:23,086
Sir? You're gonna
have to pay for that.

41
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:27,008
Maybe we could make a deal
for it, little boy?

42
00:04:27,181 --> 00:04:30,881
- Oh, I'm not a real boy.
- Do you want to be?

43
00:04:33,479 --> 00:04:37,808
Nobody needs your deals
anymore, Grumpel Stinkypants!

44
00:04:43,822 --> 00:04:47,321
I wish that ogre was never born!

45
00:04:59,379 --> 00:05:01,586
Wake up, Daddy, wake up!

46
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:05,507
- Good morning.
- Good morning to you.

47
00:05:08,597 --> 00:05:10,174
Better out than in.

48
00:05:10,891 --> 00:05:12,089
That's my line.

49
00:05:12,267 --> 00:05:15,221
Did my little Fergus make a...

50
00:05:15,395 --> 00:05:18,645
...big, grownup ogre stink?!

51
00:05:18,815 --> 00:05:22,018
Oh, that's diabolical!

52
00:05:24,237 --> 00:05:27,357
And on your left, the lovable lug
that showed us you don't have to

53
00:05:27,532 --> 00:05:29,904
change your undies
to change the world!

54
00:05:31,119 --> 00:05:33,242
I wonder what Shrek's up to in there.

55
00:05:33,413 --> 00:05:36,698
Get in there. Get...
Impossible to put on!

56
00:05:37,625 --> 00:05:40,994
OK, the dragon goes under the bridge,
through the loop...

57
00:05:41,171 --> 00:05:43,543
...and finally, into the castle.

58
00:05:49,053 --> 00:05:50,252
Play date!

59
00:05:57,228 --> 00:05:59,435
Then Shrek kissed the Princess.

60
00:05:59,606 --> 00:06:01,645
She turned into a beautiful ogre
and they lived...

61
00:06:01,816 --> 00:06:02,847
Happily...

62
00:06:03,026 --> 00:06:04,484
- Ever...
- After.

63
00:06:11,159 --> 00:06:12,439
Look! A shooting star!

64
00:06:14,579 --> 00:06:16,655
So, what did you wish for?

65
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:18,907
That every day could be like this one.

66
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:20,542
Come here, you.

67
00:06:33,598 --> 00:06:34,878
Morning, Daddy.

68
00:06:35,057 --> 00:06:36,172
Morning.

69
00:06:38,436 --> 00:06:39,598
Better out than in.

70
00:06:40,771 --> 00:06:42,598
Did my little Fergus make a...

71
00:06:45,943 --> 00:06:47,983
Cute. Real cute.

72
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:50,943
This lovable lug taught us

73
00:06:51,115 --> 00:06:54,032
you don't have to change
your undies to change the world!

74
00:06:55,161 --> 00:06:56,192
Play date!

75
00:06:58,706 --> 00:07:01,327
Shrek! The outhouse is clogged up!

76
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:04,454
She turned into a beautiful ogre
and they lived...

77
00:07:04,628 --> 00:07:05,660
- Happily...
- Ever...

78
00:07:05,838 --> 00:07:06,869
After?

79
00:07:09,508 --> 00:07:11,797
- Daddy, get up!
- Morning.

80
00:07:13,929 --> 00:07:16,800
- Better out than in.
- This lovable lug...

81
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,142
- Play date!
- No!

82
00:07:20,978 --> 00:07:22,223
Outhouse again!

83
00:07:22,396 --> 00:07:23,475
Come on.

84
00:07:27,401 --> 00:07:28,564
Undies!

85
00:07:30,404 --> 00:07:31,483
Outhouse!

86
00:07:31,655 --> 00:07:33,778
- Get up, get up!
- And they lived...

87
00:07:33,949 --> 00:07:35,408
- Happily...
- Ever...

88
00:07:35,576 --> 00:07:36,821
After.

89
00:08:27,544 --> 00:08:28,872
Roar.

90
00:09:18,177 --> 00:09:19,588
Nice landing, baby.

91
00:09:19,762 --> 00:09:22,134
Hey! Now remember, don't eat the valet.

92
00:09:23,558 --> 00:09:27,223
Happy birthday, <i>niños</i>!
<i>Vamos a la fiesta</i>!

93
00:09:28,563 --> 00:09:30,187
Hey, Shrek, Shrek!

94
00:09:31,357 --> 00:09:33,978
Mr. Shrek, would you
sign our pitchforks?

95
00:09:34,152 --> 00:09:35,231
And our torches?

96
00:09:35,403 --> 00:09:37,111
Oh, man, you used to be so fierce!

97
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:39,106
Yeah, when you were a real ogre!

98
00:09:39,282 --> 00:09:41,191
A real ogre?

99
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:55,671
Shrek, it's a sing-along.
You've got to sing along!

100
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:58,959
- No, thanks.
- Please? I'll be your best friend.

101
00:09:59,135 --> 00:10:03,595
Why does being your best friend entail
me doing everything I don't want to do?

102
00:10:03,764 --> 00:10:06,089
Please, Felicia, not in Daddy's ear.

103
00:10:06,267 --> 00:10:07,512
Excuse me, Mr. Shrek?

104
00:10:07,685 --> 00:10:09,843
Could you do that
ogre roar of yours for my son?

105
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:11,515
He's a big, big fan.

106
00:10:11,689 --> 00:10:12,803
Do the roar.

107
00:10:12,982 --> 00:10:15,769
You know, I'd rather not.
It's my kids' birthday party.

108
00:10:15,943 --> 00:10:17,936
- Do the roar.
- Honey?

109
00:10:18,112 --> 00:10:19,440
Why don't you go check on the cake?

110
00:10:19,613 --> 00:10:22,982
- Sure.
- And don't forget the candles.

111
00:10:23,158 --> 00:10:24,190
Hold still.

112
00:10:24,368 --> 00:10:26,325
Thanks for the pants, Muffin Man.

113
00:10:26,495 --> 00:10:29,366
I always wanted chaps!
Yee-haw! Giddy up!

114
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:30,915
- Monsieur Shrek.
- Howdy, Shrek!

115
00:10:31,083 --> 00:10:32,743
Your cake. <i>Voilà</i>!

116
00:10:34,044 --> 00:10:37,247
- What is that supposed to be?
- That's Sprinkles the Ogre!

117
00:10:37,423 --> 00:10:39,795
Isn't he cute? He looks just like you.

118
00:10:39,967 --> 00:10:42,209
But happy. It's a party, Shrek.
You gotta cheer up!

119
00:10:42,386 --> 00:10:43,963
I'm in a great mood, actually.

120
00:10:44,138 --> 00:10:47,008
- Oh, I'm gonna lick me a rainbow!
- Donkey!

121
00:10:47,182 --> 00:10:48,345
As long as you're not doing anything,

122
00:10:48,517 --> 00:10:49,976
how about one of those
famous Shrek roars?

123
00:10:50,143 --> 00:10:52,681
- Do the roar.
- Let me set you straight, Butter Pants.

124
00:10:52,854 --> 00:10:55,392
An ogre only roars when he's angry.

125
00:10:55,566 --> 00:10:57,642
You don't want to see me angry, do you?

126
00:10:57,818 --> 00:10:59,098
Do it.

127
00:11:00,529 --> 00:11:02,403
Hold it together. Just hold it together.

128
00:11:02,572 --> 00:11:04,648
Daddy, he's getting away. Do something.

129
00:11:04,825 --> 00:11:06,105
Oh, good.

130
00:11:06,284 --> 00:11:09,784
- What happened to the cake?
- Trust me. It's an improvement.

131
00:11:09,955 --> 00:11:11,532
- You licked it!
- No.

132
00:11:11,707 --> 00:11:14,577
Just because you're an ogre,
doesn't mean you have to eat like one.

133
00:11:14,751 --> 00:11:17,040
Looks like you forgot the candles!

134
00:11:17,212 --> 00:11:19,454
OK, just watch the cake.
I'll go get them.

135
00:11:19,631 --> 00:11:20,911
Watch the cake?

136
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:23,708
- Where's the cake?!
- We ate the cake.

137
00:11:23,885 --> 00:11:24,964
- Ya.
- What?

138
00:11:25,137 --> 00:11:26,382
No, don't cry.

139
00:11:26,555 --> 00:11:29,046
Hey! I believe you
promised my son a roar.

140
00:11:29,224 --> 00:11:30,635
- Do the roar.
- Roar.

141
00:11:30,809 --> 00:11:33,098
- I don't like it.
- Pigs, we need another cake.

142
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:36,105
- We ate the other cakes.
- One roar, man.

143
00:11:36,273 --> 00:11:38,680
Hey, everybody!
Shrek's gonna do his famous ogre roar!

144
00:11:38,859 --> 00:11:41,563
Not now, Donkey.
Pigs, are there any cupcakes?

145
00:11:41,736 --> 00:11:43,610
- We ate them, too.
- They have lollipops.

146
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:44,943
No, I ate them.

147
00:11:45,115 --> 00:11:47,819
- You didn't share?
- Well, you didn't share the croissants!

148
00:11:47,992 --> 00:11:50,993
- Everything's gonna be OK.
- Shrek, what's going on?

149
00:11:51,162 --> 00:11:53,119
- Come on, Shrek, your fans are waiting!
- Do the roar.

150
00:11:54,916 --> 00:11:56,576
We need the cake!

151
00:11:57,919 --> 00:12:00,244
Cake! Cake! Cake!

152
00:12:15,311 --> 00:12:16,390
I love you, Daddy.

153
00:12:16,562 --> 00:12:19,267
Everybody, I have found another cake!

154
00:12:20,608 --> 00:12:22,648
Shrek? Are you OK?

155
00:12:50,388 --> 00:12:53,591
- Unbelievable.
- Tell me about it! Those villagers...

156
00:12:53,766 --> 00:12:57,100
I'm not talking about the villagers,
Shrek. I'm talking about you.

157
00:12:57,269 --> 00:13:00,270
Is this really how you want
to remember the kids' first birthday?

158
00:13:00,439 --> 00:13:04,437
- Oh, great. So this is all my fault?
- Yes. But you know what?

159
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:06,650
Let's talk about this
after the party, at home.

160
00:13:06,821 --> 00:13:09,525
You mean that roadside
attraction we live in?

161
00:13:09,698 --> 00:13:14,195
Step right up! See the dancing ogre!
Don't worry! He won't bite!

162
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:18,533
I used to be an ogre.
Now I'm just a jolly green joke!

163
00:13:18,707 --> 00:13:23,001
OK, OK, maybe you're not
the ogre you used to be.

164
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:24,878
But maybe that's not such a bad thing.

165
00:13:25,047 --> 00:13:28,712
I wouldn't expect you to understand.
It's not like you're a real ogre.

166
00:13:28,884 --> 00:13:31,173
You spent half your life in a palace.

167
00:13:31,345 --> 00:13:33,883
And the other half
locked away in a tower.

168
00:13:35,349 --> 00:13:39,347
Look, all I want is for things to go
back to the way they used to be!

169
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:44,265
Back when villagers were afraid of me,
and I could take a mud bath in peace.

170
00:13:44,441 --> 00:13:48,024
When I could do what I wanted,
when I wanted to do it!

171
00:13:48,195 --> 00:13:51,564
Back when the world made sense!

172
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:54,409
You mean back before you
rescued me from the Dragon's Keep?

173
00:13:54,576 --> 00:13:55,952
Exactly!

174
00:14:01,792 --> 00:14:06,039
Shrek, you have
three beautiful children,

175
00:14:06,213 --> 00:14:08,371
a wife who loves you,

176
00:14:08,549 --> 00:14:12,593
friends who adore you.
You have everything.

177
00:14:15,055 --> 00:14:19,432
Why is it the only person
who can't see that is you?

178
00:14:40,247 --> 00:14:41,907
That's just great.

179
00:14:49,297 --> 00:14:51,206
If she thinks I'm gonna
slink back there and apologize,

180
00:14:52,509 --> 00:14:55,759
she's got another thing coming.
She's not the boss of me.

181
00:14:55,929 --> 00:14:59,761
I'm an ogre and I'm not gonna apologize
for acting like one.

182
00:14:59,933 --> 00:15:04,262
Help, please!
Someone, anyone at all, help me!

183
00:15:04,437 --> 00:15:06,181
Please, help!

184
00:15:06,648 --> 00:15:08,225
Please, help!

185
00:15:08,608 --> 00:15:10,399
I'm stuck! Help!

186
00:15:10,568 --> 00:15:12,395
Oh, please, help!

187
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:15,357
Someone, anyone! Help me!

188
00:15:15,532 --> 00:15:19,031
The pain! I can see
a bright light. A tunnel!

189
00:15:19,953 --> 00:15:21,661
Grandma? Is that you?

190
00:15:21,829 --> 00:15:23,205
Yeah, it's me, Granny.

191
00:15:23,373 --> 00:15:26,955
An ogre! Please, Mr. Ogre,
please don't eat me!

192
00:15:27,126 --> 00:15:28,669
I'm not gonna eat you.

193
00:15:28,836 --> 00:15:32,122
But you are an ogre... Aren't you?

194
00:15:32,298 --> 00:15:35,133
Yeah, well, I... I used to be.

195
00:15:35,301 --> 00:15:37,709
Look, move out or get crushed.

196
00:15:37,887 --> 00:15:39,880
So you're not gonna eat me?

197
00:15:40,056 --> 00:15:44,884
No, thanks. I already had a big bowl
of curly-toed weirdo for breakfast.

198
00:15:46,312 --> 00:15:49,229
Wait up! What's your rush?
Where you going?

199
00:15:49,398 --> 00:15:50,430
Nowhere.

200
00:15:50,608 --> 00:15:53,277
What a coincidence!
I was just heading that way myself.

201
00:15:53,444 --> 00:15:57,940
But, seriously,
let me give you a ride. I insist.

202
00:15:58,115 --> 00:16:02,493
Come on. It's the least I can do
after all you've done for me.

203
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,574
I got a hot rat cooking.

204
00:16:07,541 --> 00:16:11,206
All right! Can I interest you
in a mudslide? Slug and tonic?

205
00:16:11,379 --> 00:16:14,333
A liquid libation
to ease that frustration?

206
00:16:14,507 --> 00:16:18,800
- Eyeball-tini?
- Well, maybe just one.

207
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:23,718
So the centaur says,
"That's not the half I'm talking about."

208
00:16:24,767 --> 00:16:27,472
I gotta say, Shrek, I envy you.

209
00:16:27,645 --> 00:16:30,978
To live the life of an ogre...
no worries, no responsibilities.

210
00:16:31,148 --> 00:16:33,900
You are free to pillage
and terrorize as you please.

211
00:16:34,068 --> 00:16:37,353
- Free? That's a laugh.
- Oh, yeah?

212
00:16:37,947 --> 00:16:43,107
Sometimes I wish I had just one day
to feel like a real ogre again.

213
00:16:43,285 --> 00:16:44,400
Why didn't you say so?

214
00:16:44,578 --> 00:16:47,745
Magical transactions are my specialty!

215
00:16:47,915 --> 00:16:51,615
Great. Next to mimes,
magicians are my favourite people.

216
00:16:52,586 --> 00:16:54,080
Hold on.

217
00:16:54,254 --> 00:16:57,421
"King for a Month."
"Knight for a Week."

218
00:17:00,802 --> 00:17:02,795
Ogre for a day.

219
00:17:04,431 --> 00:17:06,471
Think about it, Shrek.
To be feared and hated.

220
00:17:06,642 --> 00:17:07,673
You'll be, like, "Roar!"

221
00:17:07,851 --> 00:17:11,434
And the villagers will be, like, "Get
away! It's Shrek! I'm so scared of him!"

222
00:17:11,605 --> 00:17:14,974
It would be just like the good old days,
when your swamp was your castle.

223
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:20,773
- When the world made sense.
- All right, what's the catch?

224
00:17:20,947 --> 00:17:24,613
Catch? No. There's no catch.
No catchings, really.

225
00:17:24,785 --> 00:17:26,861
I mean, there's something.
Small thing. Nothing. A little thing.

226
00:17:27,037 --> 00:17:30,038
All right, I knew it.
So what do you want?

227
00:17:30,207 --> 00:17:32,033
- A day.
- A day.

228
00:17:32,209 --> 00:17:33,240
Rat's done!

229
00:17:34,795 --> 00:17:37,961
To make the magic work, you gotta
give something to get something.

230
00:17:38,131 --> 00:17:41,049
In this case, you gotta
give a day to get a day. That's all.

231
00:17:41,218 --> 00:17:43,922
I can't just pick up
and leave my family.

232
00:17:44,095 --> 00:17:47,760
But that's the best part, Shrek!
It's a magical contract.

233
00:17:47,933 --> 00:17:49,759
No one will even know you're gone.

234
00:17:49,935 --> 00:17:55,724
And by the time this day is up,
you are gonna feel like a changed ogre.

235
00:17:56,691 --> 00:17:58,684
Still, I don't know.

236
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:02,395
Hey, no problem.
Forget it, no big D. Doesn't matter.

237
00:18:02,572 --> 00:18:05,063
Do you like white meat or dark meat?

238
00:18:06,326 --> 00:18:09,327
So what day would I have to give up?

239
00:18:09,496 --> 00:18:12,366
I don't know, any day.
A day from your past.

240
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:14,948
A day you had the flu?
A day you lost a pet?

241
00:18:15,126 --> 00:18:17,534
A day some meddling oaf
stuck his nose where it didn't belong

242
00:18:17,712 --> 00:18:19,337
destroying your business
and ruining your life?!

243
00:18:23,009 --> 00:18:24,468
Just for an example.

244
00:18:24,635 --> 00:18:26,379
How about the day I met Donkey?

245
00:18:26,554 --> 00:18:29,045
Now, there's a day
I'd like to take back.

246
00:18:29,682 --> 00:18:31,224
I don't know who that is.

247
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:34,633
I know. What about a day
you wouldn't even remember?

248
00:18:34,812 --> 00:18:37,019
Like a day when you were a baby.

249
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:42,432
- An innocent, mindless little baby.
- Take any of those days you want.

250
00:18:42,612 --> 00:18:46,989
- Take them all for all I care.
- Oh, just one will do.

251
00:18:48,367 --> 00:18:51,037
OK, good.
A day from your childhood it is.

252
00:18:51,204 --> 00:18:54,822
I guess there's nothing wrong
with wanting a little time for myself.

253
00:18:54,999 --> 00:18:56,541
Just 24 tiny little hours.

254
00:18:56,709 --> 00:18:58,785
- I'm still my own ogre!
- Yeah, you is!

255
00:18:58,961 --> 00:19:01,203
I never needed to ask
for anyone's permission before.

256
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:04,050
So why start now?

257
00:19:12,725 --> 00:19:14,184
Go on, Shrek.

258
00:19:14,352 --> 00:19:15,894
Sign it!

259
00:19:16,979 --> 00:19:18,438
Go on, Shrek.

260
00:19:19,565 --> 00:19:21,107
Sign it, Shrek! Sign it!

261
00:19:23,068 --> 00:19:24,100
You signed it.

262
00:19:24,278 --> 00:19:27,065
So, tell me. What happens now?

263
00:19:27,239 --> 00:19:28,899
Have a nice day.

264
00:19:46,884 --> 00:19:49,291
I think I fell on my keys.

265
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:50,750
There are 40 children in that shoe,

266
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,756
which is why the weasel
goes pop to this very day.

267
00:19:53,932 --> 00:19:54,964
Oh, great.

268
00:19:55,142 --> 00:19:57,633
As we head over the river
and through the woods...

269
00:19:57,811 --> 00:19:58,843
Ogre!

270
00:20:22,336 --> 00:20:23,830
Kill the ogre! Kill the ogre!

271
00:21:17,515 --> 00:21:20,469
This is the part where you run away!

272
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:44,531
Sure is great to be wanted again.

273
00:21:45,877 --> 00:21:47,371
Nice one.

274
00:21:56,053 --> 00:21:57,429
Fiona?

275
00:22:07,607 --> 00:22:09,101
Oh, no.

276
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,740
My home.

277
00:22:26,083 --> 00:22:27,412
Fiona!

278
00:22:29,587 --> 00:22:32,422
Fiona! Are you in there?!

279
00:23:10,127 --> 00:23:12,285
All right, Rumpel!

280
00:23:12,963 --> 00:23:15,454
This wasn't part of the deal!

281
00:23:18,802 --> 00:23:20,296
Rumpel!

282
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:43,739
Ogre!

283
00:23:44,828 --> 00:23:48,161
We've got another one, ladies! Get him!

284
00:23:49,708 --> 00:23:51,368
Who are you?!

285
00:23:51,543 --> 00:23:53,536
What are you doing in my swamp?

286
00:23:59,801 --> 00:24:02,007
Looks like a troublemaker!

287
00:24:14,566 --> 00:24:15,846
Spread 'em!

288
00:24:18,069 --> 00:24:20,192
Nice job, ladies!

289
00:24:27,745 --> 00:24:32,039
You witches are making a big mistake!
I know my rights!

290
00:24:32,208 --> 00:24:34,830
You have the right to shut your mouth!

291
00:24:54,397 --> 00:24:57,896
Donkey, stop with the singing, will you?

292
00:24:58,734 --> 00:25:00,063
Donkey!

293
00:25:09,412 --> 00:25:11,903
Donkey, where am I? What's happening?

294
00:25:12,081 --> 00:25:15,248
Quiet down there! Oh, I hate this song.

295
00:25:21,966 --> 00:25:24,753
I'm driving,
so I'm in charge of the music.

296
00:25:25,928 --> 00:25:28,763
Will you witches make up your mind?

297
00:25:37,565 --> 00:25:41,147
Donkey? What's going on?
Do you know where Fiona is?

298
00:25:41,777 --> 00:25:44,482
Quiet, ogre! You're gonna get me
in trouble and I need this job.

299
00:25:44,655 --> 00:25:46,315
I am not going back to work
for Old MacDonald.

300
00:25:46,490 --> 00:25:49,277
Tell me to E-l-E-l-O.
"E-l-E-l-No!" That's what I said.

301
00:25:49,452 --> 00:25:53,152
Where are my babies?
And where's your wife, Dragon?

302
00:25:53,330 --> 00:25:56,165
Look, I think you have me confused
with some other talking donkey.

303
00:25:56,333 --> 00:25:57,709
I've never seen you before in my life.

304
00:25:57,876 --> 00:26:00,450
Never seen me before?
Come on, Donkey!

305
00:26:00,629 --> 00:26:02,788
And how do you
know my name anyway?

306
00:26:02,965 --> 00:26:05,835
It's me, Shrek. Your best friend?

307
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:07,921
A donkey and an ogre friends?

308
00:26:08,095 --> 00:26:10,337
That's the most
ridiculous thing I ever heard!

309
00:26:13,183 --> 00:26:15,674
Can you at least tell me
where they're taking me?

310
00:26:15,853 --> 00:26:19,019
To the same place they take
every ogre. To Rumpelstiltskin.

311
00:26:19,815 --> 00:26:22,899
- Stiltskin!
- I said quiet!

312
00:26:30,325 --> 00:26:33,030
Oh, no.

313
00:26:44,339 --> 00:26:47,009
It's time to crumble!

314
00:26:47,175 --> 00:26:51,505
Place your bets!
Place your bets! We start <i>tout de suite!</i>

315
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:52,711
Yeah!

316
00:26:55,851 --> 00:26:57,226
Gingy?

317
00:27:01,189 --> 00:27:03,016
Gingy snap!

318
00:27:05,610 --> 00:27:06,641
There's one!

319
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:08,528
Disgusting, filthy ogre!

320
00:27:09,197 --> 00:27:10,442
Hideous monster!

321
00:27:10,615 --> 00:27:12,240
Filthy, filthy creature!

322
00:27:12,409 --> 00:27:14,697
Disgusting creature!

323
00:27:40,770 --> 00:27:42,478
Move it!

324
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:02,332
Don't worry, Donkey.
I'll get us our lives back.

325
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:05,667
Yeah, right. Put a little mustard
on mine, Captain Crazy!

326
00:28:42,790 --> 00:28:44,617
Mr. Stiltskin?

327
00:28:46,669 --> 00:28:48,792
You got another customer.

328
00:28:49,171 --> 00:28:51,662
- Wolfie!
- Yes, Mr. Stiltskin.

329
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,667
Bring me my business wig.

330
00:28:53,843 --> 00:28:56,049
Mr. Stiltskin, please!

331
00:28:58,973 --> 00:29:01,428
- OK, go.
- Please make me a real boy!

332
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:04,969
Go away! Terms are
in the details, balsa boy.

333
00:29:05,145 --> 00:29:07,897
Sayonara, termites! Hello, acne!

334
00:29:08,482 --> 00:29:09,810
Stiltskin!

335
00:29:11,193 --> 00:29:12,272
Shrek!

336
00:29:14,238 --> 00:29:15,697
There he is!

337
00:29:16,699 --> 00:29:18,109
So close!

338
00:29:18,867 --> 00:29:21,821
Have I been waiting for you!

339
00:29:22,705 --> 00:29:25,195
Ladies, this is the guy

340
00:29:25,374 --> 00:29:28,743
that made all of this possible!

341
00:29:29,837 --> 00:29:32,375
So, tell me, how are you
enjoying your day?

342
00:29:32,548 --> 00:29:35,667
All right, Rumpel, what's going on?
What have you done?

343
00:29:35,843 --> 00:29:39,009
No, Shrek, it's not what I've done.
It's what you've done.

344
00:29:39,179 --> 00:29:42,963
Thanks to you, the King and Queen
signed their kingdom over to me.

345
00:29:43,141 --> 00:29:44,552
They would never do that.

346
00:29:44,726 --> 00:29:49,353
They would if I promised them
all their problems would disappear.

347
00:29:50,857 --> 00:29:53,183
<i>And then they disappeared!</i>

348
00:30:02,536 --> 00:30:03,911
They would have done anything

349
00:30:04,079 --> 00:30:06,202
if they thought it would
end their daughter's curse.

350
00:30:06,373 --> 00:30:08,745
I ended Fiona's curse!

351
00:30:08,917 --> 00:30:12,250
How could you when you never existed?

352
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:15,421
You better start making sense,
you dirty little man!

353
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:17,879
Here, let me spell it out for you!

354
00:30:18,051 --> 00:30:22,380
You gave me a day from your past,
a day you couldn't even remember.

355
00:30:22,555 --> 00:30:26,767
A day when you were
an innocent, mindless little baby.

356
00:30:30,396 --> 00:30:31,974
You took the day I was born.

357
00:30:32,148 --> 00:30:35,149
No, Shrek. You gave it to me.

358
00:30:35,318 --> 00:30:38,853
Enjoy this while you can, Stiltskin,
because when this day is up...

359
00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:41,735
But you haven't heard the best part.

360
00:30:41,908 --> 00:30:47,614
Since you were never born, once
this day comes to an end, so will you.

361
00:30:51,668 --> 00:30:53,292
Where's Fiona?

362
00:30:54,003 --> 00:30:55,201
Where's my family?

363
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:58,583
Silly little ogre.
You don't get it, do you?

364
00:30:58,758 --> 00:31:01,296
You see, you were never born.

365
00:31:01,469 --> 00:31:03,592
You never met Fiona.

366
00:31:03,763 --> 00:31:07,346
Your kids don't exist.

367
00:31:10,228 --> 00:31:13,431
How's that for a metaphysical paradox?

368
00:31:15,274 --> 00:31:17,682
Looks like you got
exactly what you wanted!

369
00:31:18,694 --> 00:31:21,945
- Happy Ogre Day!
- Rumpel!

370
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:25,230
Get him, witches!

371
00:31:35,753 --> 00:31:39,003
You know what'd help morale
around here? Flip-flop Fridays.

372
00:31:39,173 --> 00:31:41,842
Feet be comfortable
with the breeze on your toes.

373
00:31:48,849 --> 00:31:50,509
Come on, girls!

374
00:32:01,153 --> 00:32:04,854
Lock all the doors,
you worthless witches! Do it!

375
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:09,284
I'll be right back, Donkey!

376
00:32:09,453 --> 00:32:12,869
I don't know you! I don't know him!

377
00:32:32,351 --> 00:32:34,343
I'm glad I'm not you.

378
00:32:39,024 --> 00:32:40,352
Help me! Help!

379
00:32:41,568 --> 00:32:42,599
Help!

380
00:32:51,036 --> 00:32:52,578
No, not my pretty ball!

381
00:32:57,042 --> 00:32:58,869
Watch out!

382
00:33:11,014 --> 00:33:12,045
Wolfie?

383
00:33:12,224 --> 00:33:14,549
My angry wig.

384
00:33:23,443 --> 00:33:26,563
Help! I've been kidnapped
by a deranged, unbalanced ogre!

385
00:33:26,738 --> 00:33:28,149
Donkey! Get off of me!

386
00:33:28,323 --> 00:33:31,240
Watch it with your pointy hooves!

387
00:33:38,291 --> 00:33:39,916
- Just take my wallet!
- Hey!

388
00:33:40,085 --> 00:33:42,077
I'm being ass-napped!

389
00:33:42,712 --> 00:33:43,875
Animal cruelty! Help!

390
00:33:44,047 --> 00:33:46,123
You need to calm down!

391
00:33:46,299 --> 00:33:47,462
I'm your friend.

392
00:33:48,218 --> 00:33:50,294
I'm not gonna hurt you, all right?

393
00:33:51,262 --> 00:33:53,136
Good. I'm gonna let go...

394
00:33:53,306 --> 00:33:55,762
...right... now.

395
00:33:55,934 --> 00:33:58,472
Please! Eat my face last!
Send my hooves to my mama!

396
00:33:58,645 --> 00:34:01,100
Donkey! You've got to trust me.

397
00:34:01,272 --> 00:34:03,846
- Why should I trust you?
- Because...

398
00:34:04,025 --> 00:34:06,101
Because...

399
00:34:09,781 --> 00:34:11,109
OK.

400
00:34:48,944 --> 00:34:53,191
Fine! Go ahead!
Run away! Who needs you?

401
00:35:26,732 --> 00:35:29,401
I've never seen an ogre cry.

402
00:35:34,907 --> 00:35:36,615
I'm not crying.

403
00:35:36,784 --> 00:35:38,823
It's nothing to be ashamed of.
I cry all the time.

404
00:35:38,994 --> 00:35:41,912
Just thinking about my grandma,
or thinking about baby kittens,

405
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:46,410
or my grandma kissing a baby kitten,
or a little baby grandma kitten.

406
00:35:47,753 --> 00:35:50,707
- That is so darn sad.
- I said, I'm not crying!

407
00:35:50,881 --> 00:35:52,755
Take it easy, I'm only trying to help.

408
00:35:52,925 --> 00:35:54,751
It's none of my business
why you're upset.

409
00:35:55,761 --> 00:35:57,089
By the way, why are you upset?

410
00:35:57,262 --> 00:36:00,133
I was tricked into signing something
I shouldn't have.

411
00:36:00,307 --> 00:36:02,596
You signed up for one of them
time-shares, huh?

412
00:36:02,768 --> 00:36:05,437
No. I signed this.

413
00:36:06,104 --> 00:36:08,595
You should never sign a contract
with Rumpelstiltskin!

414
00:36:08,774 --> 00:36:10,102
Yeah, I got that.

415
00:36:10,275 --> 00:36:12,268
- His fine print is crafty.
- I know.

416
00:36:12,444 --> 00:36:14,769
- His exit clauses are sneaky.
- Yeah, I...

417
00:36:15,614 --> 00:36:18,069
- What did you say?
- I'm talking about the exit clause.

418
00:36:18,241 --> 00:36:19,404
Used to be, you had to guess his name,

419
00:36:19,576 --> 00:36:21,485
but now everybody knows
who Rumpelstiltskin is.

420
00:36:21,661 --> 00:36:23,286
Donkey, I've read the fine print.

421
00:36:23,455 --> 00:36:25,780
There's nothing
about an exit clause in here.

422
00:36:25,957 --> 00:36:27,866
Well, you didn't expect him
to make it easy for you.

423
00:36:28,043 --> 00:36:30,284
Here, let me show you how it's done.

424
00:36:30,462 --> 00:36:31,956
I didn't spend all that time
around them witches

425
00:36:32,130 --> 00:36:33,790
without picking up a few tricks.

426
00:36:33,965 --> 00:36:36,172
Your tiny, little ogre brain
couldn't begin to comprehend

427
00:36:36,343 --> 00:36:38,631
the complexity
of my polygonic foldability skills.

428
00:36:38,803 --> 00:36:40,048
What are you doing?

429
00:36:40,221 --> 00:36:43,306
Hey, I can't get my origami on
unless you back off.

430
00:36:43,475 --> 00:36:46,760
Thank you. OK, here's what you
gotta do. You fold this piece here,

431
00:36:46,937 --> 00:36:49,309
make this letter match up here,
bring this corner here,

432
00:36:49,481 --> 00:36:53,644
and if you do it just right,
it will show you what to do. There!

433
00:36:53,818 --> 00:36:56,144
"Try Lou's Bliss."

434
00:36:59,157 --> 00:37:00,188
Who's Lou?

435
00:37:00,366 --> 00:37:02,158
Give me that!

436
00:37:07,499 --> 00:37:09,538
"True Love's Kiss."

437
00:37:11,836 --> 00:37:14,327
You have to take me to dinner first.

438
00:37:15,173 --> 00:37:18,339
"According to fairy tale law,
if not fully satisfied,

439
00:37:18,509 --> 00:37:22,009
true love's kiss will render
this contract null and void."

440
00:37:22,179 --> 00:37:25,679
Donkey, you did it! Look at you!

441
00:37:25,850 --> 00:37:30,642
If Fiona and I share true love's kiss,
I will get my life back!

442
00:37:30,813 --> 00:37:33,731
OK! This isn't a petting zoo!
So where is this Fiona?

443
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:36,818
Well, that's just it, you see.

444
00:37:37,487 --> 00:37:38,862
I don't know.

445
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:41,188
You know, when I lose something,
I always try to retrace my steps.

446
00:37:41,365 --> 00:37:43,691
So... where did you leave her last?

447
00:37:44,368 --> 00:37:46,527
The last time I saw her,

448
00:37:46,704 --> 00:37:49,373
I told her I wished
I'd never rescued her.

449
00:37:51,375 --> 00:37:54,495
- Oh, no.
- Shrek?

450
00:37:54,670 --> 00:37:57,244
Shrek! Shrek, wait! Wait, Shrek!

451
00:37:57,423 --> 00:37:59,546
What, are you crazy?
That's the Dragon's Keep!

452
00:37:59,717 --> 00:38:01,626
They keep dragons in there!

453
00:38:03,512 --> 00:38:04,923
OK, yeah, fine! Go ahead!

454
00:38:05,097 --> 00:38:08,015
I'm gonna just hang back here
and find us some breakfast!

455
00:38:18,819 --> 00:38:20,064
Fiona!

456
00:38:55,272 --> 00:38:56,932
Oh, no.

457
00:39:07,868 --> 00:39:10,156
If I didn't save Fiona...

458
00:39:13,123 --> 00:39:14,831
...then who did?

459
00:39:25,385 --> 00:39:30,177
This is the favour Fiona was
supposed to give me on the day we met.

460
00:39:31,808 --> 00:39:33,848
It's a symbol of our love.

461
00:39:34,686 --> 00:39:35,801
Now smell it!

462
00:39:35,979 --> 00:39:37,853
Hey, man, get that dirty
favour out of my face!

463
00:39:38,022 --> 00:39:41,557
Your nose is the only chance
I have of tracking down my wife,

464
00:39:41,735 --> 00:39:44,308
so stop complaining and start smelling.

465
00:39:44,487 --> 00:39:45,946
Smell it! Get it! Away you go, girl!

466
00:39:46,114 --> 00:39:47,822
Do I look like a bloodhound to you?

467
00:39:47,991 --> 00:39:50,398
In case you haven't noticed,
I'm a donkey, not a dog!

468
00:39:50,577 --> 00:39:53,328
If I was a dog, they'd call me Dog,
not Donkey!

469
00:39:53,496 --> 00:39:54,872
And another thing...

470
00:39:55,874 --> 00:39:57,332
Wait a minute.

471
00:39:58,001 --> 00:39:59,412
I think I got something.

472
00:40:00,044 --> 00:40:02,333
- Whatever it is, it's sweet.
- Fiona.

473
00:40:02,505 --> 00:40:04,130
Luscious and tasty.

474
00:40:04,299 --> 00:40:06,837
Hey! That's my wife
you're talking about.

475
00:40:08,428 --> 00:40:09,507
Donkey!

476
00:40:13,516 --> 00:40:15,592
Yeah! Waffles!

477
00:40:15,768 --> 00:40:18,722
And I thought the Waffle Fairy
was just a bedtime story.

478
00:40:19,272 --> 00:40:22,854
Sticky stacks of golden,
syrupy deliciousness!

479
00:40:23,026 --> 00:40:25,184
Donkey! Don't eat that!

480
00:40:25,361 --> 00:40:29,489
There's a stack of freshly made waffles
in the middle of the forest.

481
00:40:29,657 --> 00:40:31,531
Don't you find that
a wee bit suspicious?

482
00:40:32,285 --> 00:40:34,443
Oh, you... I'm just... What are you...?

483
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:36,578
Bad Donkey! Mustn't.

484
00:40:36,748 --> 00:40:40,792
I said, don't! Don't!
No! Get away from it.

485
00:40:41,711 --> 00:40:42,742
You did.

486
00:40:49,885 --> 00:40:51,000
Look out!

487
00:40:54,098 --> 00:40:55,129
Donkey!

488
00:40:55,308 --> 00:40:57,715
- Are you OK?
- I'm fine.

489
00:40:59,895 --> 00:41:00,975
Donkey.

490
00:41:03,482 --> 00:41:05,060
Help! Help me!

491
00:41:05,234 --> 00:41:07,986
Help, Shrek! Help!

492
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:32,958
Watch your head.

493
00:41:33,178 --> 00:41:34,507
Hey, it's a new guy!

494
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:36,803
Look at him, all dressed up
in his Sunday vest.

495
00:41:36,974 --> 00:41:38,717
He's really tiny, isn't he?

496
00:41:38,893 --> 00:41:40,968
Yeah. Fate has delivered us
a comrade-in-arms

497
00:41:41,145 --> 00:41:42,769
and for that, we are thankful.
Suit him up!

498
00:41:42,938 --> 00:41:44,895
- Let's go, greenie.
- Now, wait a minute!

499
00:41:49,862 --> 00:41:51,688
- Hey!
- Here you go.

500
00:41:56,994 --> 00:41:59,781
- Welcome to the resistance.
- Resistance?

501
00:41:59,955 --> 00:42:03,538
We fight for freedom
and ogres everywhere!

502
00:42:13,010 --> 00:42:14,634
I didn't know we could do that.

503
00:42:14,803 --> 00:42:17,294
Help! You can't eat me! I got the mange!

504
00:42:17,472 --> 00:42:21,933
- I'm poisonous! I'm all poi...
- I'll take him! This order's to go.

505
00:42:22,102 --> 00:42:24,510
Hey! I haven't removed his giblets yet.

506
00:42:24,688 --> 00:42:26,846
Trust me, you don't want
to eat this one.

507
00:42:27,023 --> 00:42:29,063
I go down smooth,
but come out fighting!

508
00:42:29,234 --> 00:42:31,310
- Let go!
- Don't make Mama mad.

509
00:42:31,486 --> 00:42:32,565
Your dinner is my friend!

510
00:42:32,738 --> 00:42:34,860
- Come on, guys!
- I got to get the giblets out!

511
00:42:35,031 --> 00:42:37,024
- She's back.
- There she is.

512
00:42:54,884 --> 00:42:55,964
Fiona!

513
00:42:58,096 --> 00:43:00,172
I'm so happy I found you!

514
00:43:08,356 --> 00:43:09,731
Maybe you missed orientation,

515
00:43:09,899 --> 00:43:13,399
but for future reference,
personal space is very important to me.

516
00:43:14,696 --> 00:43:16,522
You don't know who I am, do you?

517
00:43:16,697 --> 00:43:18,192
No.

518
00:43:18,366 --> 00:43:20,359
Brogan, I have news from Far Far Away.

519
00:43:20,535 --> 00:43:22,693
Gather the others
and meet me in the war room.

520
00:43:22,871 --> 00:43:25,362
Gretched, make sure everyone
is prepared to move out tonight.

521
00:43:25,540 --> 00:43:27,497
- I need to talk to you.
- What is it?

522
00:43:27,667 --> 00:43:32,210
OK, I know you don't
remember me, but...

523
00:43:32,380 --> 00:43:34,456
...we're married. Hear me out.

524
00:43:34,632 --> 00:43:37,384
And at the birthday party
with some pigs and a puppet,

525
00:43:37,552 --> 00:43:38,962
the villagers wanted me
to sign their pitchforks,

526
00:43:39,136 --> 00:43:41,176
and this boy kept saying,
"Do the roar."

527
00:43:41,347 --> 00:43:43,755
Then I punched the cakes that the
pigs ate and the next thing I knew,

528
00:43:43,933 --> 00:43:46,258
my donkey fell in your waffle hole.

529
00:43:48,813 --> 00:43:51,304
Right? Who's with me?

530
00:43:53,067 --> 00:43:55,688
I guess I must have kicked him
harder than I thought.

531
00:43:55,862 --> 00:43:58,068
Fiona, I need to...

532
00:43:59,573 --> 00:44:02,064
Witches! All right, everyone,
you know the drill!

533
00:44:02,243 --> 00:44:04,070
- Fiona!
- Witches! Oh, no!

534
00:44:04,245 --> 00:44:06,321
- Witches! Witches!
- Come on, now.

535
00:44:35,234 --> 00:44:38,021
Fiona, that's the third patrol today.
We can't hide forever.

536
00:44:38,195 --> 00:44:41,778
Trust me, Brogan.
After tonight, we won't have to.

537
00:44:43,367 --> 00:44:46,534
- That's your wife?
- That's my wife.

538
00:44:46,954 --> 00:44:49,990
Well, I see who wears the chain mail
in your family!

539
00:44:53,168 --> 00:44:58,163
Some people like to look
at the goblet as... as half empty.

540
00:44:58,340 --> 00:45:02,338
Me, I like to look at it as half full.

541
00:45:03,178 --> 00:45:06,298
We've gone from the bottom
to the top, ladies.

542
00:45:06,473 --> 00:45:09,593
But we're not just an empire.

543
00:45:10,143 --> 00:45:11,388
We're a family.

544
00:45:12,396 --> 00:45:16,096
Everyone has got their cupcake?
Cupcake, cupcake? Good. Yes? Baba?

545
00:45:16,275 --> 00:45:17,306
Good.

546
00:45:17,484 --> 00:45:20,687
Yeah, you know, we have
put away a lot of ogres.

547
00:45:20,862 --> 00:45:25,026
And so one got away.
Who cares? It's not a big deal.

548
00:45:25,534 --> 00:45:27,610
It doesn't matter to me.

549
00:45:27,786 --> 00:45:30,538
It's not like it's the end of the world.

550
00:45:31,706 --> 00:45:34,624
Except... funny thing.

551
00:45:34,793 --> 00:45:38,292
Now that I think about it,
the ogre who got away is Shrek!

552
00:45:38,463 --> 00:45:41,298
And if he shares a kiss
with Fiona by sunrise,

553
00:45:41,466 --> 00:45:44,633
it is the end of the world! Our world!

554
00:45:44,803 --> 00:45:46,677
My empire!

555
00:45:50,225 --> 00:45:52,680
But, as I was saying,

556
00:45:52,852 --> 00:45:56,897
I like to look at the goblet
as half full.

557
00:45:58,358 --> 00:46:00,351
Yelling makes me so parched.

558
00:46:00,527 --> 00:46:04,359
Would anyone care for some water?
Wet your whistle?

559
00:46:04,531 --> 00:46:07,401
A clear, crisp, delicious glass...

560
00:46:07,575 --> 00:46:10,742
<i>...of agua purificada</i>?

561
00:46:10,912 --> 00:46:13,237
Anybody's thirsty?
Nobody's thirsty? No?

562
00:46:14,249 --> 00:46:16,241
Well, then does anyone care to tell me

563
00:46:16,417 --> 00:46:19,039
what it's going to take
to get this ogre? You.

564
00:46:19,212 --> 00:46:20,327
Faster brooms?

565
00:46:20,505 --> 00:46:22,083
- No!
- Pointier hats?

566
00:46:22,257 --> 00:46:23,881
- No! You!
- Maybe we could hire

567
00:46:24,050 --> 00:46:25,758
a professional bounty hunter?

568
00:46:26,803 --> 00:46:29,757
What a world! What a world!

569
00:46:31,391 --> 00:46:34,308
You know, actually
not a bad idea. Baba!

570
00:46:34,936 --> 00:46:36,560
I need a bounty hunter.

571
00:46:36,729 --> 00:46:39,896
And if music doth
soothe the savage beast...

572
00:46:40,066 --> 00:46:43,269
...then I think I might know
just the person!

573
00:46:45,613 --> 00:46:49,860
Listen up, everyone.
Word has come from Far Far Away.

574
00:46:50,034 --> 00:46:53,201
Stiltskin is leading
tonight's ogre hunt himself.

575
00:46:53,371 --> 00:46:55,079
- He's never done that before.
- What? Why?

576
00:46:55,248 --> 00:46:57,074
I bet that's because of us.

577
00:46:57,250 --> 00:46:58,993
If that cupcake-eating clown

578
00:46:59,168 --> 00:47:02,288
finally leaves the safety
of his filthy witch nest...

579
00:47:02,963 --> 00:47:04,244
...he'll be vulnerable.

580
00:47:04,423 --> 00:47:07,590
The plan's simple.
If they follow the usual patrol route,

581
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:09,883
they'll reach the river by midnight.

582
00:47:10,054 --> 00:47:13,553
We'll be concealed along this road,
waiting for his caravan.

583
00:47:13,724 --> 00:47:17,058
Once they reach the clearing,
I'll give the signal.

584
00:47:17,228 --> 00:47:19,102
And then we attack!

585
00:47:24,860 --> 00:47:28,110
And when the smoke clears...
Wait, what's this?

586
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:29,561
That's my chimichanga stand.

587
00:47:30,658 --> 00:47:32,816
No, Cookie. We won't be needing that.

588
00:47:32,993 --> 00:47:36,694
Trust me, Fiona. Y'all gonna be
really hungry after this ambush, OK?

589
00:47:37,623 --> 00:47:39,414
Go and finish your little speech.

590
00:47:40,167 --> 00:47:43,618
All right, as I was saying,
when the smoke clears,

591
00:47:43,796 --> 00:47:47,496
Rumpelstiltskin is gone
and the chimichangas have been eaten.

592
00:47:47,675 --> 00:47:50,296
Far Far Away will finally be free.

593
00:47:50,469 --> 00:47:52,212
- And so will we.
- Spread the word.

594
00:47:52,388 --> 00:47:55,638
We move out as soon as
Rumpel leaves the palace.

595
00:47:57,976 --> 00:48:00,183
- Man, this is serious!
- Tell me about it.

596
00:48:00,354 --> 00:48:02,927
How am I ever gonna
get her to kiss me before sunrise?

597
00:48:03,107 --> 00:48:04,649
Actually, I was talking
about the revolution.

598
00:48:04,817 --> 00:48:06,311
Revolution?

599
00:48:06,485 --> 00:48:08,394
Why don't you just
tell her what you told me?

600
00:48:08,570 --> 00:48:11,192
About how you're her true love and
you came from an alternate universe.

601
00:48:11,365 --> 00:48:13,156
Well, while I'm at it,
why don't I tell her

602
00:48:13,325 --> 00:48:15,318
that you're married
to a fire-breathing dragon

603
00:48:15,494 --> 00:48:18,530
and you have little, mutant
donkey-dragon babies.

604
00:48:19,039 --> 00:48:20,202
I do?!

605
00:48:20,374 --> 00:48:23,291
You saw what happened.
She's gonna think I'm crazy.

606
00:48:23,460 --> 00:48:24,658
I'm a daddy?

607
00:48:24,836 --> 00:48:28,205
You know what?
If I got Fiona to kiss me once...

608
00:48:30,217 --> 00:48:32,008
...then I can do it again.

609
00:48:32,886 --> 00:48:35,092
Shrek, do my babies
have hooves or talons?

610
00:48:35,263 --> 00:48:36,841
Donkey...!

611
00:48:37,015 --> 00:48:38,426
Hello?

612
00:48:39,893 --> 00:48:41,056
Fiona?

613
00:48:47,067 --> 00:48:50,151
You should not be here, <i>señor.</i>

614
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:51,695
Puss?

615
00:48:57,202 --> 00:48:58,910
You've gotta be kidding me.

616
00:49:12,759 --> 00:49:15,214
Feed me, if you dare.

617
00:49:15,386 --> 00:49:18,720
Puss, what happened to you?
You got so fa...

618
00:49:20,099 --> 00:49:23,100
...fancy.
- Do I know you?

619
00:49:23,269 --> 00:49:25,843
Well, where's your hat?
Where's your belt?

620
00:49:26,022 --> 00:49:27,765
Your wee little boots?

621
00:49:27,940 --> 00:49:30,396
Boots? For a cat? Ha!

622
00:49:30,568 --> 00:49:33,653
But you're Puss in Boots.

623
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:35,858
Maybe once.

624
00:49:36,032 --> 00:49:37,574
But that is a name I have outgrown.

625
00:49:37,742 --> 00:49:39,402
That's not the only thing
you've outgrown.

626
00:49:39,577 --> 00:49:43,657
Hey! I may have let myself go
a little since retirement,

627
00:49:43,831 --> 00:49:46,405
but hanging up my sword
was the best decision of my life.

628
00:49:46,584 --> 00:49:49,620
I have all the cream I can drink
and all the mice I can chase.

629
00:49:51,255 --> 00:49:52,631
I'll get him later.

630
00:49:52,799 --> 00:49:55,206
Puss, what have I done to you?

631
00:49:55,385 --> 00:49:56,843
You've gone soft.

632
00:49:57,637 --> 00:50:01,800
Well, I do get brushed twice a day.

633
00:50:02,975 --> 00:50:04,600
Look, it's not too late to fix it.

634
00:50:04,769 --> 00:50:07,010
All you have to do is help me
get a kiss from Fiona.

635
00:50:07,188 --> 00:50:10,308
What are you doing?
Can I help you with something?

636
00:50:10,483 --> 00:50:13,437
Well, I know how stressful
mounting a rebellion can be...

637
00:50:13,611 --> 00:50:15,604
...rallying the troops,
planning attacks,

638
00:50:15,780 --> 00:50:19,564
so I brought you a little something
to ease the tension.

639
00:50:20,117 --> 00:50:21,197
A gift basket?

640
00:50:21,368 --> 00:50:23,990
You're welcome.
So let's see what you got.

641
00:50:24,163 --> 00:50:26,535
Heart-shaped box of slugs.

642
00:50:27,166 --> 00:50:29,622
Skunk-scented candle.

643
00:50:29,794 --> 00:50:34,171
- Look, this really isn't the...
- What's this? Coupons!

644
00:50:34,340 --> 00:50:36,379
Let's see,
"Good for one free foot massage."

645
00:50:36,550 --> 00:50:38,875
"A mud facial!"
Oh, and here's one...

646
00:50:39,053 --> 00:50:42,587
"Good for one free kiss."
Let's cash it now.

647
00:50:42,765 --> 00:50:44,757
Look, I don't know
what this is all about,

648
00:50:44,934 --> 00:50:46,476
but I'm trying to run a revolution.

649
00:50:46,644 --> 00:50:48,850
So unless you have
Rumpelstiltskin's head in there,

650
00:50:49,021 --> 00:50:51,144
I suggest you take your gift basket,

651
00:50:51,315 --> 00:50:55,015
get out of my tent
and go make yourself useful!

652
00:50:55,694 --> 00:50:59,988
Wow. You're right. I am sorry.

653
00:51:00,157 --> 00:51:03,193
I was just trying to be friendly.
No hard feelings?

654
00:51:04,828 --> 00:51:05,860
An apologetic hug?

655
00:51:07,081 --> 00:51:08,361
And a quick kiss goodbye.

656
00:51:09,875 --> 00:51:10,906
Hey!

657
00:51:11,501 --> 00:51:13,660
Wait! Is that mistletoe I see?

658
00:51:15,380 --> 00:51:18,749
Hey, Shrek! Are my babies cute, or do
they make people feel uncomfortable?

659
00:51:18,926 --> 00:51:22,045
- Where'd we find that guy?
- Could it be true?

660
00:51:22,220 --> 00:51:26,432
Have the years of prim
and pampery made me soft?

661
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:29,517
Don't be silly.
Now who's a pretty kitty?

662
00:51:29,686 --> 00:51:31,229
I am.

663
00:51:39,071 --> 00:51:41,608
Daddy thinks you look real nice, Fifi.

664
00:51:42,907 --> 00:51:43,939
Honk.

665
00:51:44,117 --> 00:51:45,695
All right, Piggies, be gone!

666
00:51:45,869 --> 00:51:48,075
Don't forget to take
her little potty box with you.

667
00:51:49,039 --> 00:51:50,996
This little piggy wants to go home!

668
00:51:51,166 --> 00:51:54,451
- Mr. Stiltskin! He's here.
- Nice.

669
00:52:08,224 --> 00:52:11,391
Pied Piper. How was your commute?

670
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:14,559
Good.

671
00:52:14,731 --> 00:52:16,474
You call this guy a bounty hunter?

672
00:52:16,649 --> 00:52:19,520
What's he gonna do,
flute those ogres a lullaby?

673
00:52:31,498 --> 00:52:33,122
OK, got it!

674
00:52:34,333 --> 00:52:36,457
Make it stop!

675
00:52:40,757 --> 00:52:42,132
All right, that's enough.

676
00:52:45,469 --> 00:52:49,135
Looks like it's time to pay the piper.

677
00:52:51,309 --> 00:52:54,061
Griselda, seriously,
it's time to pay the piper.

678
00:52:54,229 --> 00:52:57,265
Now go get my cheque book!
Go! Move! Get out!

679
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:59,433
Things are getting
real sloppy around here!

680
00:53:02,862 --> 00:53:04,689
Here, now make sure they eat up!

681
00:53:04,864 --> 00:53:08,149
You can't end tyranny on
an empty stomach! Go on! Go!

682
00:53:08,326 --> 00:53:09,820
Din-din!

683
00:53:17,585 --> 00:53:20,455
- Come on, Donkey.
- One more time, please?

684
00:53:20,630 --> 00:53:22,918
All right, but this is the last time.

685
00:53:24,467 --> 00:53:25,498
Here it comes. Look at him.

686
00:53:30,848 --> 00:53:32,675
I see you!

687
00:53:39,607 --> 00:53:41,480
That's quite a friend you've got there.

688
00:53:41,650 --> 00:53:43,773
I can see why you haven't eaten him.

689
00:53:43,944 --> 00:53:46,566
Donkey! I hate to pull you away
from your adoring public,

690
00:53:46,739 --> 00:53:49,028
but I'm not getting anywhere with Fiona.

691
00:53:49,199 --> 00:53:52,284
- I need your help!
- Hey, everybody. Who wants dessert?

692
00:53:55,080 --> 00:53:57,120
- Where'd you get these?
- Fiona's garbage.

693
00:53:57,291 --> 00:54:00,208
Just another gift from some
clueless lover boy.

694
00:54:02,004 --> 00:54:03,664
That's a good one, Cookie!

695
00:54:04,673 --> 00:54:07,674
Anyone who knows Fiona knows
this stuff ain't gonna work on her.

696
00:54:07,843 --> 00:54:09,337
Works on me.

697
00:54:09,511 --> 00:54:12,382
Donkey, what am I gonna do?
It's like I don't even know her.

698
00:54:12,556 --> 00:54:15,925
You in trouble, Romeo. The only thing
Fiona cares about is her cause.

699
00:54:16,101 --> 00:54:19,102
- To the cause!
- To the cause!

700
00:54:21,273 --> 00:54:22,436
All right!

701
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:45,911
Hello!

702
00:54:49,926 --> 00:54:52,002
- Nice moves.
- What are you doing?

703
00:54:52,178 --> 00:54:54,883
What does it look like?
I'm getting ready for ambush action.

704
00:54:55,056 --> 00:54:57,726
Oh, yeah.
I always like to quad my lutes

705
00:54:57,893 --> 00:55:02,056
and do some scrunches
before an operational... op.

706
00:55:02,230 --> 00:55:03,261
This one taken?

707
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:05,267
We use that to clean the toilets.

708
00:55:07,194 --> 00:55:10,313
And we use that one to clean
the thing we clean the toilets with.

709
00:55:10,488 --> 00:55:11,769
I knew that.

710
00:55:12,866 --> 00:55:13,980
There you go, chief.

711
00:55:31,134 --> 00:55:33,292
Hey... Scott?

712
00:55:33,803 --> 00:55:35,630
My name is Shrek, actually.

713
00:55:35,805 --> 00:55:38,640
You're going to get yourself killed
at the ambush tonight.

714
00:55:38,808 --> 00:55:42,426
I'll be fine.
I think I can take care of myself...

715
00:55:42,937 --> 00:55:44,182
Well, let's see about that.

716
00:55:44,605 --> 00:55:47,061
Hey! Hey... Hey!

717
00:55:47,233 --> 00:55:48,264
What the...?

718
00:55:52,989 --> 00:55:54,317
Fiona?

719
00:56:26,897 --> 00:56:28,178
I got it.

720
00:56:28,524 --> 00:56:29,853
Give me your hand.

721
00:56:32,195 --> 00:56:33,902
The dragon goes under the bridge,

722
00:56:34,071 --> 00:56:36,313
through the loop and finally...

723
00:56:36,490 --> 00:56:38,068
Into the castle.

724
00:56:46,709 --> 00:56:48,037
Wow.

725
00:56:49,753 --> 00:56:51,876
OK. Good.

726
00:56:52,506 --> 00:56:54,214
It seems like you can handle yourself.

727
00:56:54,383 --> 00:56:56,340
- But, Fiona...
- Go get ready for the mission!

728
00:56:56,510 --> 00:56:59,511
- I will, but Fiona...
- That's an order!

729
00:57:10,607 --> 00:57:14,023
All right, let's get those axes
sharpened and weapons packed!

730
00:57:14,195 --> 00:57:15,772
Preparation is half the battle!

731
00:57:16,947 --> 00:57:21,408
Ogre! <i>Un momento</i>! <i>Un momento</i>!

732
00:57:21,910 --> 00:57:24,448
Ogre, ogre, <i>un momento</i>!

733
00:57:26,081 --> 00:57:27,362
Just give me a minute.

734
00:57:27,541 --> 00:57:30,376
Look, Puss, I'm a little
pressed for time.

735
00:57:30,544 --> 00:57:33,711
I am not believing
what I have just witnessed.

736
00:57:33,881 --> 00:57:35,541
Back there, you and Fiona.

737
00:57:35,716 --> 00:57:38,385
There was a spark...
a spark inside her heart

738
00:57:38,552 --> 00:57:40,260
I thought was long extinguished.

739
00:57:40,429 --> 00:57:44,841
It was as if, for one moment,
Fiona had actually found her true love!

740
00:57:45,017 --> 00:57:48,350
I am her true love. I ended her curse.

741
00:57:48,937 --> 00:57:50,764
You know of her curse?

742
00:57:50,939 --> 00:57:54,225
By day, one way, by night another.

743
00:57:54,401 --> 00:57:57,153
<i>This shall be the norm.</i>

744
00:57:57,320 --> 00:58:00,820
<i>Until you find true love's first kiss...</i>

745
00:58:02,117 --> 00:58:05,984
<i>...and then take love's true form.</i>

746
00:58:06,872 --> 00:58:08,745
You even know the little rhyme!

747
00:58:08,915 --> 00:58:11,406
It is true! You are the one!
You must prove it to her!

748
00:58:11,584 --> 00:58:13,743
- How?
- Convince her!

749
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:15,249
Go to her when she is alone

750
00:58:15,422 --> 00:58:19,087
and tell her something
that only her true love would know.

751
00:58:19,259 --> 00:58:20,801
Know about what?!

752
00:58:22,804 --> 00:58:25,509
Whoa! That's a whole lot of kitty!
Shrek, can we keep him?

753
00:58:42,657 --> 00:58:44,484
Excuse me. Coming through!

754
00:58:44,659 --> 00:58:47,364
Pardon me, guys! Watch your back.

755
00:58:47,537 --> 00:58:50,407
Look, Donkey,
the chimichanga cart! Quick!

756
00:58:50,582 --> 00:58:53,452
<i>Ándale</i>! After him, <i>burro</i>!
Donkey, <i>vámonos</i>!

757
00:58:53,626 --> 00:58:55,749
Man, you are a cat-astrophe!

758
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:58,292
And you are ri-donkey-Ious!

759
00:59:04,178 --> 00:59:06,966
I'll scout ahead. Wait for my signal.

760
00:59:12,020 --> 00:59:13,893
Secure your positions!

761
00:59:30,246 --> 00:59:32,784
- It's quite a view from up here.
- What are you doing?!

762
00:59:32,957 --> 00:59:33,988
Get back in position!

763
00:59:34,166 --> 00:59:37,251
You need to know,
once and for all, who I really am.

764
00:59:37,420 --> 00:59:38,878
You are going to ruin everything!

765
00:59:39,046 --> 00:59:41,288
Ruin everything?
Actually, I'm gonna fix everything...

766
00:59:41,465 --> 00:59:44,170
The ogres, Rumpel, your curse.

767
00:59:45,761 --> 00:59:47,421
How do you know about my curse?!

768
00:59:47,596 --> 00:59:52,009
OK, OK, please, Fiona...
Just hear me out.

769
00:59:52,184 --> 00:59:54,722
I can explain everything.

770
00:59:58,232 --> 01:00:01,019
- Where's Fiona's signal?
- What's she waiting for?

771
01:00:01,193 --> 01:00:04,028
- He's going to get away!
- No, he's not.

772
01:00:29,596 --> 01:00:33,380
Listen, I don't know who you are
or how you know about my curse,

773
01:00:33,559 --> 01:00:35,432
but if any of these ogres
find out I'm...

774
01:00:35,602 --> 01:00:38,852
- A beautiful princess?
- That is not who I am! Not anymore.

775
01:00:39,022 --> 01:00:42,059
- Look, I know you're upset.
- You don't know anything about me.

776
01:00:42,234 --> 01:00:43,894
I know everything about you.

777
01:00:44,069 --> 01:00:47,070
I know you sing so beautifully
that birds explode.

778
01:00:47,239 --> 01:00:49,397
- Big deal.
- I know that when you sign your name,

779
01:00:49,574 --> 01:00:52,244
- you put a heart over the "l".
- So what?

780
01:00:52,410 --> 01:00:54,403
I know that when
you see a shooting star,

781
01:00:54,579 --> 01:00:56,572
you cross your fingers on both hands,

782
01:00:56,748 --> 01:01:00,532
squinch up your nose
and you make a wish.

783
01:01:00,711 --> 01:01:03,581
I know that you don't like the covers
wrapped around your feet,

784
01:01:03,755 --> 01:01:05,415
and I know that you sleep by candlelight

785
01:01:05,590 --> 01:01:07,583
because every time
you close your eyes...

786
01:01:08,635 --> 01:01:11,636
...you're afraid you're gonna
wake up back in that tower.

787
01:01:13,348 --> 01:01:15,471
But, most importantly, Fiona...

788
01:01:16,476 --> 01:01:20,059
...I know that the reason
you turn human every day...

789
01:01:22,357 --> 01:01:24,433
...is because you've
never been kissed...

790
01:01:25,860 --> 01:01:26,975
...well...

791
01:01:29,489 --> 01:01:30,652
...by me.

792
01:01:40,208 --> 01:01:44,122
- You move fast.
- It's not me doing the moving.

793
01:01:46,130 --> 01:01:48,289
- Why is this happening?!
- Love?

794
01:01:48,466 --> 01:01:51,586
- No, I'm being forced to dance!
- By love!

795
01:01:51,761 --> 01:01:54,513
No, I can't stop myself!

796
01:01:54,681 --> 01:01:57,516
Please! Make it stop!

797
01:01:57,684 --> 01:01:59,842
I can't control myself!

798
01:02:03,690 --> 01:02:06,809
Yeah! Cookie's bringing
the heat out of the kitchen!

799
01:02:09,070 --> 01:02:11,525
Oh, no! It's the Piper!

800
01:02:13,700 --> 01:02:17,318
I can't believe I let this happen,
and it's all because of you!

801
01:02:17,495 --> 01:02:21,908
- If you'd just let me kiss you!
- What? You're insane!

802
01:02:36,847 --> 01:02:40,927
We must do something before
they fandango themselves into oblivion!

803
01:02:41,102 --> 01:02:44,518
- What can we do?
- First, you must stop dancing!

804
01:02:44,689 --> 01:02:47,393
When somebody tooties that fluty,
I got to shake my booty!

805
01:02:47,566 --> 01:02:49,191
Then it's up to me!

806
01:02:57,743 --> 01:03:01,575
Hurry! We must get them
away from the music!

807
01:03:03,916 --> 01:03:07,000
Puss and Donkey to the rescue!
We saved the day!

808
01:03:32,695 --> 01:03:35,186
Donkey... Can I borrow your tongue?

809
01:03:35,364 --> 01:03:36,443
Say what?!

810
01:03:37,408 --> 01:03:38,736
No. Hell...

811
01:03:41,203 --> 01:03:44,239
I don't care how big your eyes get,
player, it's not going down.

812
01:03:50,003 --> 01:03:51,083
All right!

813
01:03:51,588 --> 01:03:52,619
Stop!

814
01:03:52,798 --> 01:03:55,253
- Where are you going?
- To save my friends.

815
01:03:55,425 --> 01:03:58,260
- How, by getting yourself killed?
- If that's what it takes.

816
01:03:58,428 --> 01:03:59,709
Puss, say something.

817
01:03:59,888 --> 01:04:01,762
- Puss?
- Let me explain.

818
01:04:01,932 --> 01:04:04,055
That's how you knew so much about me.

819
01:04:04,226 --> 01:04:07,310
- Fiona, wait! Kiss me.
- What?

820
01:04:07,479 --> 01:04:09,104
It's the only way to save your friends.

821
01:04:09,272 --> 01:04:10,304
Get out of my way.

822
01:04:10,482 --> 01:04:13,602
You used to believe that a single kiss
could solve everything!

823
01:04:40,220 --> 01:04:44,431
I don't understand.
This doesn't make any sense.

824
01:04:44,599 --> 01:04:47,220
True love's kiss
was supposed to fix everything!

825
01:04:47,394 --> 01:04:49,469
Yeah, you know,
that's what they told me, too.

826
01:04:49,646 --> 01:04:51,971
True love didn't get me
out of that tower.

827
01:04:52,148 --> 01:04:54,853
I did. I saved myself.

828
01:04:56,027 --> 01:04:59,479
Don't you get it?
It's all just a big fairy tale.

829
01:04:59,656 --> 01:05:02,063
Fiona, don't say that. It does exist!

830
01:05:02,241 --> 01:05:03,617
How would you know?

831
01:05:03,785 --> 01:05:06,489
Did you grow up locked away
in a dragon's keep?

832
01:05:06,663 --> 01:05:09,498
Did you live all alone
in a miserable tower?

833
01:05:09,666 --> 01:05:11,991
Did you cry yourself
to sleep every night,

834
01:05:12,168 --> 01:05:14,741
waiting for a true love
that never came?!

835
01:05:16,047 --> 01:05:19,630
But... But I'm your true love.

836
01:05:19,801 --> 01:05:23,217
Then where were you
when I needed you?

837
01:05:35,066 --> 01:05:37,557
Maybe you kissed her wrong?

838
01:05:38,194 --> 01:05:39,225
No.

839
01:05:39,779 --> 01:05:41,570
The kiss didn't work...

840
01:05:42,531 --> 01:05:44,857
...because Fiona doesn't love me.

841
01:05:51,415 --> 01:05:53,123
Don't despair, fellow ogres!

842
01:05:53,292 --> 01:05:57,539
They can put us in cages,
but they can't cage our honour!

843
01:05:58,923 --> 01:06:01,840
Shrek and Fiona are together?!

844
01:06:03,927 --> 01:06:07,178
Yeah, I've heard enough of
your toot-a-lee-toots! You blew it!

845
01:06:07,348 --> 01:06:09,008
Wolfie! My speech wig.

846
01:06:09,183 --> 01:06:13,430
Baba! Ready my makeup.
And Piper, pull my socks up.

847
01:06:15,898 --> 01:06:18,519
- Tight.
- Attention, citizens.

848
01:06:19,318 --> 01:06:23,612
Please stay tuned for a message
from our tyrannical dictator!

849
01:06:24,990 --> 01:06:28,406
Hello, people.
It is I, Rumpelstiltskin...

850
01:06:28,577 --> 01:06:30,653
...shepherd of your dreams.

851
01:06:32,498 --> 01:06:35,452
Recently, a certain somebody

852
01:06:35,626 --> 01:06:38,959
has jeopardized our joyous lives.

853
01:06:39,922 --> 01:06:44,880
And that somebody
is the rat-munching ogre called Shrek!

854
01:06:45,052 --> 01:06:47,341
That is why I come to you,
dear citizens.

855
01:06:47,512 --> 01:06:50,004
For whomever brings me this ogre,

856
01:06:50,182 --> 01:06:54,180
shall receive the deal of a lifetime.

857
01:06:54,853 --> 01:06:56,264
Just think of it! Total and

858
01:06:56,438 --> 01:06:58,146
- complete happiness.
- Ya!

859
01:06:58,315 --> 01:07:01,766
Dazzling, radiant fulfilment!
All your greatest wishes.

860
01:07:01,944 --> 01:07:03,936
- Yeah!
- Your wildest dreams.

861
01:07:04,113 --> 01:07:08,739
Anything you could ever want!
No strings attached!

862
01:07:09,034 --> 01:07:12,118
But hurry, this is a limited time offer.

863
01:07:12,287 --> 01:07:18,123
So light your torches, sharpen
your pitchforks and get your mob on!

864
01:07:18,627 --> 01:07:21,663
Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!

865
01:07:25,926 --> 01:07:27,965
Go back where you came from!

866
01:07:31,139 --> 01:07:32,764
It seems that we are safe.

867
01:07:32,933 --> 01:07:35,720
Yeah, it looks a lot less pitchforky
and torchy out there. Let's go.

868
01:07:35,894 --> 01:07:39,974
What's the point?
The kiss didn't work. It's over.

869
01:07:40,148 --> 01:07:43,149
Look, Shrek, I know things
might seem a little bleak right now,

870
01:07:43,318 --> 01:07:45,773
but things always work themselves
out in the end, you'll see.

871
01:07:45,946 --> 01:07:48,318
- I bet by this time tomorrow...
- Don't you understand?

872
01:07:48,489 --> 01:07:50,150
There is no tomorrow.

873
01:07:50,325 --> 01:07:54,275
There's no day after that, and there's
no day after that day after that!

874
01:07:54,454 --> 01:07:57,953
My life was perfect
and I'm never going to get it back!

875
01:07:58,124 --> 01:08:01,707
If your life was so perfect, why'd you
sign it away to Rumpelstiltskin?

876
01:08:01,878 --> 01:08:05,247
Because I didn't know
what I had until it was gone! All right?

877
01:08:10,053 --> 01:08:11,879
I didn't know what I had.

878
01:08:14,474 --> 01:08:17,973
Surrender now! I'm taking you in!

879
01:08:18,561 --> 01:08:22,096
Don't try to fight it, ogre!
The reward is mine!

880
01:08:22,273 --> 01:08:23,304
Gingy?

881
01:08:24,108 --> 01:08:26,516
- You unhand me, green devil!
- What are you doing?

882
01:08:26,694 --> 01:08:27,975
Collecting my bounty!

883
01:08:28,154 --> 01:08:30,146
- Bounty?
- What are you talking about, cracker?

884
01:08:30,907 --> 01:08:33,362
Rumpelstiltskin promised
the deal of a lifetime

885
01:08:33,534 --> 01:08:36,535
- for whoever could bring you in.
- Deal of a lifetime?

886
01:08:36,704 --> 01:08:39,740
Where all your wishes come true.

887
01:08:41,417 --> 01:08:42,746
Wait a minute.

888
01:08:43,544 --> 01:08:46,249
- I can still fix this.
- How you gonna do that?

889
01:08:46,422 --> 01:08:50,716
You know what? I'm gonna give
Rumpelstiltskin exactly what he wants.

890
01:08:50,885 --> 01:08:53,210
OK, Gingy, tell me about this...

891
01:08:57,600 --> 01:08:59,592
Were you going to eat that?

892
01:09:01,604 --> 01:09:04,688
Not Shrek. That is not Shrek.
Also not Shrek.

893
01:09:04,857 --> 01:09:08,143
That's not even an ogre,
it is a troll! Nice try.

894
01:09:08,319 --> 01:09:09,350
- And that...
- Roar.

895
01:09:09,528 --> 01:09:10,560
...is just sad.

896
01:09:11,405 --> 01:09:13,279
And what is that supposed to be?

897
01:09:13,449 --> 01:09:15,026
I'm just a frightened old man.

898
01:09:15,201 --> 01:09:18,118
Don't listen to him!
These ogres are crafty!

899
01:09:18,287 --> 01:09:19,912
That is your father painted green.

900
01:09:20,081 --> 01:09:22,120
No, it's Shrek! Honest!

901
01:09:23,667 --> 01:09:24,699
Take them away!

902
01:09:24,877 --> 01:09:27,748
Can no one bring me Shrek?!
Where is he?

903
01:09:27,921 --> 01:09:30,626
How hard can it be?!
I want him! I want him! I want him!

904
01:09:31,133 --> 01:09:32,461
Stiltskin!

905
01:09:34,053 --> 01:09:35,761
I hear you're looking for me.

906
01:09:36,597 --> 01:09:38,554
All right! Finally!

907
01:09:38,724 --> 01:09:42,175
Who turned him in?
Who gets the deal of a lifetime?

908
01:09:42,353 --> 01:09:44,179
- I do.
- What? But...

909
01:09:44,354 --> 01:09:48,269
If I'm turning myself in,
I get the deal of a lifetime.

910
01:09:51,278 --> 01:09:55,026
That means you have
to give me anything I want.

911
01:09:55,199 --> 01:09:57,772
No! Only true love's kiss
can break your contract!

912
01:09:57,951 --> 01:09:59,825
So if you thought you were just gonna...

913
01:10:00,871 --> 01:10:05,118
...in here and get your life back...
- I'm not here to get my life back.

914
01:10:05,667 --> 01:10:08,075
Then what do you want?

915
01:10:18,847 --> 01:10:21,338
The ogres. They are all free.

916
01:10:21,516 --> 01:10:23,011
But where is Shrek?

917
01:10:28,189 --> 01:10:30,515
This is not good.

918
01:10:31,651 --> 01:10:35,151
I don't know.
Not much of a storybook ending.

919
01:10:35,322 --> 01:10:41,158
The noble Shrek turns himself in
to save a bunch of filthy ogres.

920
01:10:41,703 --> 01:10:44,372
All that matters is that they're free...

921
01:10:44,873 --> 01:10:46,865
...and Fiona is safe.

922
01:10:48,376 --> 01:10:51,330
I bet Fiona would be
really touched to hear that.

923
01:10:52,005 --> 01:10:53,285
But, hey...

924
01:10:53,465 --> 01:10:56,382
...I guess you can tell her yourself.

925
01:10:57,218 --> 01:10:58,677
Fiona!

926
01:11:07,062 --> 01:11:11,355
Stiltskin, we had a deal!
You agreed to free all ogres!

927
01:11:11,524 --> 01:11:12,769
Oh, yeah.

928
01:11:12,942 --> 01:11:17,569
But Fiona isn't all ogre, is she?

929
01:11:20,575 --> 01:11:26,364
By day, one way, by night, another.
Blardy, blardy, blar.

930
01:11:28,250 --> 01:11:30,456
Nobody's smart but me!

931
01:11:38,593 --> 01:11:41,083
That was a really brave thing
you did, Shrek.

932
01:11:41,846 --> 01:11:42,877
Thank you.

933
01:11:43,598 --> 01:11:45,923
No, you were right.

934
01:11:46,768 --> 01:11:48,891
I wasn't there for you.

935
01:11:49,062 --> 01:11:51,387
And not just at
the Dragon's Keep, but...

936
01:11:52,732 --> 01:11:54,475
...every day since.

937
01:11:55,442 --> 01:11:56,605
Well...

938
01:11:57,611 --> 01:11:59,236
...you're here now.

939
01:12:01,949 --> 01:12:03,741
Let go of me! I have got to save Shrek!

940
01:12:03,909 --> 01:12:05,285
Don't be a fool, mule!

941
01:12:05,453 --> 01:12:07,944
She's right. Rumpel's palace
is locked up tighter

942
01:12:08,122 --> 01:12:11,408
- than Old Mother Hubbard's Cupboard.
- And that cupboard wasn't guarded

943
01:12:11,584 --> 01:12:14,584
by a whole bunch of
mean, ugly, nasty witches.

944
01:12:14,753 --> 01:12:17,624
Hey! We can hear you!

945
01:12:18,465 --> 01:12:19,960
Sorry!

946
01:12:21,427 --> 01:12:23,253
We must get into the palace.

947
01:12:23,429 --> 01:12:25,552
Man, Shrek and me
just busted out of that place!

948
01:12:25,723 --> 01:12:27,265
But how?

949
01:12:28,476 --> 01:12:31,430
The same way we're gonna bust in.

950
01:12:35,899 --> 01:12:40,027
Yay! My new pretty ball!
Didn't it look bigger in the catalogue?

951
01:12:40,196 --> 01:12:41,773
I guess it'll have to do.

952
01:12:47,244 --> 01:12:51,953
Witches, finally, the moment
we've all been waiting for.

953
01:12:52,124 --> 01:12:54,911
The main event of the evening!

954
01:12:55,085 --> 01:12:58,252
I present Shrek and Fiona!

955
01:13:03,343 --> 01:13:07,388
And now, to put the past
behind us once and for all,

956
01:13:07,556 --> 01:13:11,304
I give you a princess's worst nightmare!

957
01:13:11,477 --> 01:13:15,059
Fiona's old flame,
the keeper of the keep...

958
01:13:15,230 --> 01:13:16,808
...Dragon!

959
01:13:39,796 --> 01:13:42,085
- Donkey?
- And Puss!

960
01:13:45,886 --> 01:13:47,000
In Boots!

961
01:14:17,125 --> 01:14:19,165
Get them, get them, witches!

962
01:14:21,003 --> 01:14:22,546
Incoming!

963
01:14:26,759 --> 01:14:29,131
- Donkey, woo her!
- Woo who?

964
01:14:29,303 --> 01:14:30,679
Your wife!

965
01:14:54,746 --> 01:14:55,860
Uh-oh.

966
01:15:01,377 --> 01:15:04,663
I'll call you! We're in love!

967
01:15:16,434 --> 01:15:17,893
Fiona, hold on!

968
01:15:19,604 --> 01:15:21,228
Hey, you!

969
01:15:50,759 --> 01:15:53,844
- Chimichangas?!
- Get 'em while they're hot!

970
01:16:00,769 --> 01:16:01,967
Jump!

971
01:16:05,440 --> 01:16:06,639
Now!

972
01:16:20,706 --> 01:16:23,327
The dragon goes under the bridge!

973
01:16:24,459 --> 01:16:25,954
Through the loop!

974
01:16:26,127 --> 01:16:27,207
And finally...

975
01:16:27,379 --> 01:16:28,957
Into the castle!

976
01:16:35,637 --> 01:16:37,012
Run!

977
01:16:43,145 --> 01:16:44,473
Foo!

978
01:16:46,314 --> 01:16:47,643
So long!

979
01:16:50,526 --> 01:16:51,642
Come on, Fifi, go!

980
01:16:51,820 --> 01:16:53,693
Go! Witches, close up the floor!

981
01:16:54,823 --> 01:16:57,444
Come on, Fifi, go! Flappity flap!

982
01:16:57,617 --> 01:17:00,986
Come on, go! Fly away! Up, up! Go!

983
01:17:01,830 --> 01:17:03,158
Fifi, no!

984
01:17:07,919 --> 01:17:09,828
Victory is ours!

985
01:17:18,221 --> 01:17:21,222
Looks like we're having
curly-toed weirdo for breakfast.

986
01:17:21,391 --> 01:17:23,964
Hey, we make a pretty good team.

987
01:17:24,144 --> 01:17:26,101
You have no idea.

988
01:17:34,028 --> 01:17:35,357
Shrek?

989
01:17:38,157 --> 01:17:41,028
His day is up. His day is...!

990
01:17:41,619 --> 01:17:42,782
Shrek?

991
01:17:43,871 --> 01:17:45,531
It's all right.

992
01:17:49,085 --> 01:17:51,374
There has to be something I can do.

993
01:17:52,213 --> 01:17:55,831
You've already done
everything for me, Fiona.

994
01:17:56,008 --> 01:17:58,582
You gave me a home and a family.

995
01:17:58,761 --> 01:18:00,504
You have kids?

996
01:18:00,680 --> 01:18:02,672
We have kids.

997
01:18:02,849 --> 01:18:06,716
Fergus, Farkle
and a little girl named...

998
01:18:06,894 --> 01:18:08,223
...Felicia.
- Felicia.

999
01:18:09,105 --> 01:18:11,892
I always wanted to have
a daughter named Felicia.

1000
01:18:12,441 --> 01:18:14,102
And someday...

1001
01:18:15,778 --> 01:18:17,106
...you will.

1002
01:18:27,790 --> 01:18:30,459
You know what the
best part of today was?

1003
01:18:33,087 --> 01:18:37,250
I got the chance to fall in love
with you all over again.

1004
01:19:11,166 --> 01:19:14,001
Fiona, the sunrise!

1005
01:19:14,169 --> 01:19:16,458
You're still... an ogre!

1006
01:19:18,966 --> 01:19:21,919
- True love's form.
- Impossible!

1007
01:19:22,678 --> 01:19:24,337
The kiss worked.

1008
01:19:31,020 --> 01:19:32,348
What?!

1009
01:19:41,780 --> 01:19:43,191
Fifi!

1010
01:19:44,992 --> 01:19:46,320
Puss!

1011
01:19:48,662 --> 01:19:50,405
No, no, no!

1012
01:19:50,580 --> 01:19:53,665
No, not yet! I'm not ready! No, wait!

1013
01:20:07,806 --> 01:20:09,265
I love you, Daddy!

1014
01:20:09,432 --> 01:20:12,683
Shrek! Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!

1015
01:20:17,106 --> 01:20:20,310
Everybody, I have found another cake!

1016
01:20:21,069 --> 01:20:23,357
Shrek? Are you OK?

1017
01:20:29,869 --> 01:20:34,033
Fiona. I've never been better.

1018
01:20:36,209 --> 01:20:37,869
Roar!

1019
01:20:42,715 --> 01:20:45,041
Happy Birthday, Farkle.

1020
01:20:45,218 --> 01:20:47,506
Fergus, my little man!

1021
01:20:47,679 --> 01:20:49,967
And Felicia, sweetheart.

1022
01:20:50,139 --> 01:20:52,381
I believe this is yours.

1023
01:20:53,768 --> 01:20:55,428
Thank you, Daddy.

1024
01:20:56,938 --> 01:20:59,429
Hey, Uncle Shrek! How about
giving my babies an encore!

1025
01:20:59,607 --> 01:21:01,730
