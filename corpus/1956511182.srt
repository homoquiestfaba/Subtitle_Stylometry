Yes.

we finish our studies

Keep your mouth shut.

Read this for me, babes.
Me eyes hurt.

Which one is it?

78
00:07:35,756 --> 00:07:37,589
- Eni's mum.
- Eni's mum.

79
00:07:37,591 --> 00:07:39,624
Blimey. Eni's parents
not coming down again.

80
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:42,494
They only live a couple
of hours away in London.

81

Too bleeding busy trying to become
lawyers instead of visiting their boy.

Eni really gets on my nerves, Lynn.

00:07:48,335 --> 00:07:50,435
Thought you liked
having the kids.

00:07:50,437 --> 00:07:52,637
I don't mind Dopey and Mingle,
his sisters and the rest of them,

85
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,906
but... he just rubs me
the wrong way.

86
00:07:54,908 --> 00:07:59,644
Y'know, scrounging for attention all the
time like he's special. He's annoying.

87
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:02,547
- Aw, you don't mean that, Ing.
- She's only jealous 'cause he's happy.

88
00:08:02,549 --> 00:08:04,049
No, I ain't.

89
00:08:04,051 --> 00:08:06,585
He thinks he's better
than the rest of 'em.

90
00:08:06,587 --> 00:08:08,920
Look at him. Sits behind there,
talking to hisself,

91
00:08:08,922 --> 00:08:10,489
saying he's got
an imaginary friend.

92
00:08:10,491 --> 00:08:12,390
So? What's wrong with that?

93
00:08:12,392 --> 00:08:16,828
I got me an imaginary friend
and I call him Tom. Tom Jones.

94
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:19,431
(laughter) -
I remember your mother telling me

95
00:08:19,433 --> 00:08:21,800
you was like that as a toddler.

96
00:08:21,802 --> 00:08:23,602
Always in your own world.

97
00:08:23,604 --> 00:08:26,204
Don't want none of my kids
growing up soft, that's all.

98
00:08:26,206 --> 00:08:29,574
- No chance of that.
- How much d'you say his parents give you for Eni Ing?

99
00:08:29,576 --> 00:08:31,510
£13 a week for him
and his sisters.

100
00:08:31,512 --> 00:08:33,945
- Mind yourselves.
- Plus their family-allowance books.

101
00:08:33,947 --> 00:08:37,849
- What?
- Yeah, government gives them £5 vouchers per week, per kid.

102
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:39,851
I could do with a bit of that.

103
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:42,387
My Tony's been made
redundant again, ain't he?

104
00:08:42,389 --> 00:08:45,323
Lynn, you can't pick 'em up
and drop 'em as you please.

105
00:08:45,325 --> 00:08:47,792
Nah, especially when you got
social workers up your arse.

106
00:08:47,794 --> 00:08:49,060
They ain't bleedin' toys,
Lynn.

107
00:08:49,062 --> 00:08:50,529
Right.

108
00:08:51,832 --> 00:08:54,332
Divvy cods!
Get from behind there.

109
00:08:54,334 --> 00:08:56,635
Just needs to be put to work,

110
00:08:56,637 --> 00:08:58,904
instead of sitting behind that sofa
daydreaming, playing silly buggers all day.

111
00:08:58,906 --> 00:09:01,540
Yeah. No more silly buggers.

112

Shhh.

120
00:09:49,389 --> 00:09:51,423
- Oi!
- Little bleeder!

121
00:09:51,425 --> 00:09:53,792
I told you not to touch
anything, didn't I?!

122
00:09:53,794 --> 00:09:56,761
Git, wait till I get you home,
embarrass me like that.

123
00:09:56,763 --> 00:10:00,065
I'm sorry. I keep telling him not to touch.
I'm really sorry.

124
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:03,835
Come here.

125
00:10:03,837 --> 00:10:06,871
We had to do it so we didn't
get caught, alright?

126
00:10:07,507 --> 00:10:10,075
Nearly got Mummy in trouble,
didn't you? Eh? Silly?

127
00:10:10,077 --> 00:10:13,311
Got to do better if you want
to be Mummy's favourite.

128
00:10:13,313 --> 00:10:15,447
Right, you lot,
I want this place spick'n'span.

129
00:10:15,449 --> 00:10:18,383
I don't want no stuck-up social
workers saying my house ain't clean.

130
00:10:18,385 --> 00:10:21,286
I have to see if I can get
some money out of 'em.

131
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:23,054
Jack, you use that
for the bloody dog.

132
00:10:23,056 --> 00:10:25,590
I'll use 'em on bloody you
in a minute. Get here.

133
00:10:25,592 --> 00:10:28,593
It's alright all the bloody same, innit?
You don't mind, do ya, kids?

134
00:10:28,595 --> 00:10:30,428
(kids): No, Dad!
(laughter)

135
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:31,796
Oi, Herberts.
When you're done,

136
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:33,932
I want you to get round
to Aunty Lynn's.

137
00:10:33,934 --> 00:10:36,101
Don't want them knowing
how many of youse I got.

138
00:10:36,103 --> 00:10:39,571
Mum, how comes Madam doesn't
have to get her hair cut?

139
00:10:39,573 --> 00:10:43,408
Don't you worry about Madam.
Any dirt, any misbehaving,

140
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:46,878
I'll have 'em takes youse all back
to Wooga Wooga land. (kids): No!

141
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:50,949
- What's that? Ah!
- Oh, my God, it's a mouse! Kill it! Kill it!

142
00:10:50,951 --> 00:10:53,451
- I can't.
- Jack! Kill it.

143
00:10:53,453 --> 00:10:54,719
Make it go outside.

144
00:10:54,721 --> 00:10:55,954
It ain't gonna bloody
hurt you.

145
00:10:55,956 --> 00:10:57,789
It's just come for a haircut.

146
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:07,232
We love you, Mum.
(laughter)

147
00:11:09,536 --> 00:11:10,969
And what is your name?

148
00:11:10,971 --> 00:11:12,570
- Oi.
- Madam.

149
00:11:12,572 --> 00:11:15,540
Well, you're a good,
clean girl, Madam.

150
00:11:15,542 --> 00:11:17,842
Leave me alone.
(Ingrid chuckling)

151
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:19,711
No lice or ringworm,

152
00:11:19,713 --> 00:11:21,246
and their general health
seems fine.

153
00:11:21,248 --> 00:11:23,214
- I keep my kids bloody clean.
- Mrs. Carpenter,

154
00:11:23,216 --> 00:11:25,884
when did you last speak
to the families of the children?

155
00:11:25,886 --> 00:11:27,852
I ain't heard from his at all.

156
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:30,455
The others, I ain't heard or
received nothing from 'em in ages.

157
00:11:30,457 --> 00:11:32,457
- The farming phenomenon.
- The what?

158
00:11:32,459 --> 00:11:34,426
Nigerian families fostering
their children out

159
00:11:34,428 --> 00:11:37,195
to white families across the country -
it's what we term it.

160
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:40,265
They ain't bleedin' potatoes. Why don't
you call 'em something friggin' sensible?

161
00:11:40,267 --> 00:11:43,168
The practice has been tripling
in the last six months.

162
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:44,969
And regrettably,
the welfare resources

163
00:11:44,971 --> 00:11:47,505
aren't designed
to extend to private fostering.

164
00:11:47,507 --> 00:11:50,809
- What d'you expect me to do? I got nothing to feed them on.
- You can't cope?

165
00:11:50,811 --> 00:11:53,178
No, I'm saying I could use
a bit of help.

166
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:55,080
If we can't track down
the natural parents,

167
00:11:55,082 --> 00:11:57,215
the new directives tell us
to place the children

168
00:11:57,217 --> 00:11:58,717
in care institutions
until they're deported

169
00:11:58,719 --> 00:12:00,852
to the closet known relative...
- Wait. Hang on.

170

They were born here, they're British.
You can't deport them.

00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:05,657
Well, we hope
it won't come to that.

172
00:12:05,659 --> 00:12:07,625
We all want the best for
the children, Mrs. Carpenter.

00:12:07,627 --> 00:12:09,961
But it's a question of budget.

174
00:12:09,963 --> 00:12:14,766
You say your husband is a long-distance
lorry driver, away for days at a time.

175
00:12:14,768 --> 00:12:16,301
Will he be coming today?

176
00:12:16,303 --> 00:12:18,503
We did ask to see
the both of you.

177
00:12:18,505 --> 00:12:20,238

Them bastard Smiths
set a dog on him.

212
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,367
I've had him down the hospital.
He's had 15 stitches.

213
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:31,836
What you gonna do?
- They should've stopped it.

214
00:14:31,838 --> 00:14:34,939
- Right. Nothing, then, is it?
- That bleeding dog needs putting down.

215
00:14:35,742 --> 00:14:39,711
They set a dog on your son, and your gypsy
cousins just stood there and watched.

216
00:14:39,713 --> 00:14:42,647
Now you fucking go out there
and kill it.

217
00:14:43,516 --> 00:14:46,284
I mean it, Jack.
Slit its fucking throat. I want it dead!

218
00:14:46,286 --> 00:14:47,819
Shut it.

00:14:51,324 --> 00:14:53,224

222
00:15:04,271 --> 00:15:06,838
Now, you got a choice.
You either go out there and get beat,

223
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:09,007
or come in here and get beat.
Now get out there...

224
00:15:09,009 --> 00:15:11,009
- Don't have him fighting.
- Send him out there by himself?

225
00:15:11,011 --> 00:15:12,644
He's got to learn
to fight for himself.

226
00:15:12,646 --> 00:15:15,146
Now, you pick up a brick
and you hit 'em.

Enitan, go and say hello

Look at his face.

285

Answer me. What is your name?

286
00:21:25,585 --> 00:21:27,318
So you don't want to talk?

287
00:21:28,755 --> 00:21:31,122

00:21:31,124 --> 00:21:33,891

Mr. English.

289
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:39,430

290
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:41,032

You will talk today.
You hear me?

00:22:06,392 --> 00:22:08,359
You will talk. Ah!

297
00:22:08,895 --> 00:22:11,962
- Femi, Femi...
- It took us everything to get him in there.

298
00:22:11,964 --> 00:22:13,764
Let's think about this
for a second.

299
00:22:13,766 --> 00:22:16,033
What is there to think about?
We gave him everything.

300
00:22:17,437 --> 00:22:19,970
We'll find him another school.
There's so many schools out there.

301
00:22:19,972 --> 00:22:23,741
Where, Tolu? That was the third one.
I don't know what else to do.

302
00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:27,678
- Uh, okay, we'll educate him ourselves...
- When, Tolu?

303
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:30,247
We are both working
night and day.

304
00:22:30,249 --> 00:22:33,384
Look,
the boy is beating teachers,

305
00:22:33,386 --> 00:22:34,952
and he still won't speak.

306
00:22:34,954 --> 00:22:37,455
Can't you see there's something
wrong with him?

307
00:22:37,457 --> 00:22:39,657
Femi, Femi, wait. Please.

308
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:43,227
I'm afraid. I don't want
to lose my son again.

309
00:22:43,229 --> 00:22:45,262
Calm down.

310
00:22:45,264 --> 00:22:48,032
I don't want to lose him,
either, eh?

311
00:22:48,968 --> 00:22:51,635
But I don't want my son
to end up a dullard.

312
00:22:51,637 --> 00:22:56,040
If he stays here, we know that
he's going to become a ruffian.

313
00:22:56,042 --> 00:22:58,376
Please.
- Remember what Elijah said.

314
00:22:58,378 --> 00:23:01,879
He needs to be here.
He has to be here.

315
00:23:01,881 --> 00:23:03,514
He told us.

316
00:23:03,516 --> 00:23:07,084
But at least if he goes there,
he will go to school.

317
00:23:08,521 --> 00:23:13,023
And maybe begin to speak again
and behave normal.

318
00:23:22,268 --> 00:23:23,667
Look at that.

319
00:23:23,669 --> 00:23:26,070
There, that one. What's that?

320
00:23:26,072 --> 00:23:28,506
It's their religion, ain't it?

321
00:23:28,508 --> 00:23:31,041
- "Vooju."
- That's wicked.

322
00:23:31,677 --> 00:23:34,245
- Ought to report 'em to the authorities.
- No, Ing.

323
00:23:34,247 --> 00:23:37,415
Lynn. Don't want the school
coming over here blaming me.

324
00:23:37,417 --> 00:23:40,017
That's another thing.
He's already behind in school.

325
00:23:40,019 --> 00:23:42,920
Reckon they couldn't find him
a school.

326
00:23:42,922 --> 00:23:46,290
Kept the girls, set him back.
Bloody ridiculous.

327
00:23:46,292 --> 00:23:50,327
He's got bruises, keeps carving stuff
over me furniture and he won't talk.

328
00:23:50,329 --> 00:23:52,029
What ya mean, he don't talk?

329
00:23:52,031 --> 00:23:54,131
They said he hasn't said
a word in six months.

330
00:23:54,133 --> 00:23:56,333
He ain't spoke a word
in six months?

331
00:23:56,335 --> 00:23:59,370
Like one of them deaf and dumbs?
- That's what they said.

332
00:23:59,372 --> 00:24:01,172
He ain't half-dark now, Ing.

333
00:24:01,174 --> 00:24:03,407
Well, I expect it's the sun,
ain't it?

334
00:24:03,409 --> 00:24:05,242
Six months of that
turn anyone blue.

335
00:24:05,244 --> 00:24:07,077
You'll be alright, though,
Ing.

336
00:24:07,079 --> 00:24:10,448
Run out of electric,
all you gotta do is ask him to smile.

337
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:12,783
He'd light up the whole bleeding street.

00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:19,657
What'd you think

340
00:24:20,593 --> 00:24:22,927
Wooga Wooga man
cut his tongue out, see?

341
00:24:22,929 --> 00:24:24,662
That's what happens
if you don't behave.

342
00:24:24,664 --> 00:24:26,664
Ain't right,
splitting 'em up like that.

343
00:24:26,666 --> 00:24:29,266
It's kidnap, ain't it?
They're allowed to just take 'em like that?

344
00:24:29,268 --> 00:24:31,988
They're fostered, not adopted.
They can take 'em whenever they want.

345
00:24:34,974 --> 00:24:36,557
Still ain't right.

346
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:38,141
He'll be alright now he's back,
won't you, son? We won't let 'em get ya.

347
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:41,645
(gasping)
Don't like it, don't like it!

348
00:24:42,515 --> 00:24:45,182
I'm the Wooga Wooga man
and I'm coming to get you!

349
00:24:55,328 --> 00:24:57,595
Wooga, Wooga, Wooga,

(laughter)

352
00:25:01,467 --> 00:25:05,436
Eni, come back here and do the
Wooga Wooga dance for Mummy.

They said she was only going

00:30:16,282 --> 00:30:19,383
You know how they are, Ing.
This was always on the cards.

They're not our kids.

414

You're the nanny,
not their mother.

420
00:30:43,375 --> 00:30:44,975
It's his bloody fault.

Then what do you care about?

437
00:32:33,953 --> 00:32:37,020
Would you like to talk inside the
car for a minute out of the rain?

438
00:32:42,261 --> 00:32:44,227
Why did you call me
a black bastard?

439
00:32:45,965 --> 00:32:47,397
'Cause...

440
00:32:49,969 --> 00:32:51,668
It's what you are.

441
00:33:04,383 --> 00:33:07,384
Did you...
ever have any dreams of...

442
00:33:07,386 --> 00:33:10,320
what you wanted to be,
growing up as a boy, Eni?

00:33:55,968 --> 00:33:57,567

Eni?

454
00:34:12,251 --> 00:34:13,917
Friends?

455
00:34:15,187 --> 00:34:17,020
Well, that's good.

457
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:23,660
Talk to 'em behind the sofa.

458
00:34:26,598 --> 00:34:27,831
You mean...

459
00:34:29,268 --> 00:34:31,034

No, when Dopey and Mingle come back,
Eni's mum wrote me,

548

asking if she could bring
some other African kids over.

549
00:40:36,001 --> 00:40:38,134
- Really?
- Yeah, Jack put a stop to it.

550
00:40:38,136 --> 00:40:41,204
Says we can't have no more,
says we're overcrowded, says it's cruel.

551
00:40:41,206 --> 00:40:44,841
Dunno what'd make a mother give up
her own child in the first place.

Oh, rainbows. Whole lot of 'em.

554
00:40:53,752 --> 00:40:55,418
What made you have 'em, Ing?

555
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:57,954
- I love 'em.
- There's so many.

556
00:40:57,956 --> 00:40:59,589

00:53:14,091 --> 00:53:16,458

Tilbury Skins! Tilbury Skins!

754
00:55:37,768 --> 00:55:41,203
He's a bloody horrible kid, Deb.
All he does is piss hisself.

755
00:55:41,205 --> 00:55:45,574
That's why he's gotta sit on that friggin'
potty all day. (indistinct chatter)

756
00:55:45,576 --> 00:55:47,242
(laughter)

757
00:55:51,716 --> 00:55:53,749
(knocking)
Shhh.

758
00:55:53,751 --> 00:55:55,784
Paddy, get down, get down,

759
00:55:55,786 --> 00:55:57,653
(whispering)
Shhh.

760
00:56:03,494 --> 00:56:04,893
What d'you want?

761
00:56:06,964 --> 00:56:08,597
Are you Mrs. Carpenter?

762
00:56:10,501 --> 00:56:13,502
I came here to speak to you
about Eni.

763
00:56:13,504 --> 00:56:17,539
My name is Constance Dapo.
I'm his teacher. I work at St. Georges.

764
00:56:17,541 --> 00:56:19,708
What about him?

765
00:56:20,745 --> 00:56:22,478
May I come in and talk?

766
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:25,080
I said what about him?

767
00:56:27,184 --> 00:56:29,685
You are Mrs. Carpenter, yes?

768
00:56:31,956 --> 00:56:35,824
I... honestly only came here
out of concern for Enitan.

769
00:56:37,061 --> 00:56:38,894
Did you know he was suspended?

770
00:56:42,166 --> 00:56:44,700
Well, his suspension ended
a month ago,

771
00:56:44,702 --> 00:56:47,035
but he hasn't returned to class.

772
00:56:47,772 --> 00:56:50,973
He's also being harassed by
local hooligans and skinheads.

773
00:56:50,975 --> 00:56:54,910
- He can handle himself.
- I saw them violate him, Mrs. Carpenter.

774
00:56:56,847 --> 00:56:58,814
They took everything
that boy had.

775
00:57:00,751 --> 00:57:04,953
Now, Eni is a promising student,
he's done well in his tests.

776
00:57:04,955 --> 00:57:07,890
- He can handle himself.
- I know what it feels like...

777
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:11,827
...to hate what you are.

778
00:57:11,829 --> 00:57:13,662
I know that feeling,
Mrs. Carpenter.

779
00:57:13,664 --> 00:57:16,031
If we don't help him,
it will be a tragic waste...

780
00:57:16,033 --> 00:57:19,668
Listen, you, I can take care
of me own kids.

781
00:57:20,171 --> 00:57:23,038
So piss off and find
some other charity case.

782
00:57:27,978 --> 00:57:29,945
Who was that?

783
00:57:29,947 --> 00:57:33,248
Some nosey cow trying to teach me
how to look after me own kids.

784
00:57:34,585 --> 00:57:37,186
(sighing) Now,
where's that bloody bastard?

785
00:57:37,188 --> 00:57:39,455
(warbling and shouting)

786
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:52,501
You want to be a skin,
you gotta get rid of this coon bush.

787
00:57:52,503 --> 00:57:55,737
- Take it like a man, coon.
- Get that wog slap off his head.

788
00:57:55,739 --> 00:57:57,973
- Ah!
- Do his eyebrows and all. Go on.

789
00:57:57,975 --> 00:58:00,309
Shave him! Shave him!
(shouting)

790
00:58:00,311 --> 00:58:02,544
(up-tempo music)

791
00:58:06,851 --> 00:58:08,917
(indistinct chatter)

792
00:58:14,592 --> 00:58:16,492
(excited chatter)
(laughter)

793
00:58:16,494 --> 00:58:18,460
(indistinct chatter)

794
00:58:19,396 --> 00:58:20,929
(excited chatter)

795
00:58:22,766 --> 00:58:26,969
Yeah, you want a picture?
Get a load of this. (indistinct chatter)

796
00:58:26,971 --> 00:58:29,438
(excited chatter)
(Skins shouting)

797
00:58:41,352 --> 00:58:44,152
Yeah! Bloody Jonesy!

798
00:58:53,764 --> 00:58:55,531
Why we always wear
tennis shirts?

799
00:58:56,600 --> 00:59:00,068
- Tennis?
- Fred Perry's a national hero, coon.

800
00:59:00,971 --> 00:59:03,138
He's won three Wimbeldons.

801
00:59:03,140 --> 00:59:06,308
- Cloth of our country.
- That why we roll up our jeans three times.

802
00:59:06,310 --> 00:59:08,810
It's a tribute to what's great
about this country.

803
00:59:10,748 --> 00:59:13,615
Churchills. Winstons.

804
00:59:13,617 --> 00:59:15,083
Dumb coon.

805
00:59:15,085 --> 00:59:18,387
You should be ashamed.
Get a bloody job.

806
00:59:20,958 --> 00:59:23,258
Let's go catch a monkey.

807
00:59:23,260 --> 00:59:25,327
(bell tolling)

808
00:59:31,602 --> 00:59:32,901
Eni?

809
00:59:37,841 --> 00:59:39,741
Eni, why aren't you back
in school?

810
00:59:39,743 --> 00:59:41,443
Your suspension ended
a month ago.

811
00:59:52,156 --> 00:59:54,823
Eni, why are you doing this?

812
00:59:55,826 --> 00:59:57,793
You don't need to do this.

813
01:00:02,533 --> 01:00:03,832
Eni...

814
01:00:05,102 --> 01:00:06,835
You should be in school.

815
01:00:08,572 --> 01:00:12,040
Please, let's talk.
You can still call me anytime.

816
01:00:14,545 --> 01:00:17,679
(crying out)
(laughter)

817
01:00:20,250 --> 01:00:22,451
Get off me! Get off me!

818
01:00:23,387 --> 01:00:26,054
(screaming)
Get off me!

819
01:00:28,225 --> 01:00:29,625
(laughter)

820
01:00:31,395 --> 01:00:33,061
Eni, stop this!

821
01:00:34,531 --> 01:00:36,598
Hello, mongrel.
You want some white?

822
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:38,567
Come here, you friggin' whore!

823
01:00:40,771 --> 01:00:43,071
(exclamations)

824
01:00:45,743 --> 01:00:47,809
Look at those little titties.

825
01:00:47,811 --> 01:00:51,179
(laughter) Come here, wog.
Let me give you a mongrel baby.

826
01:00:51,181 --> 01:00:53,582
Oh! You fucking cunt!

827
01:00:54,852 --> 01:00:57,119
- Help!!
- Come here!

828
01:00:58,756 --> 01:01:01,156
We know where you live, coon.

829
01:01:01,158 --> 01:01:03,825
Come round here again
and we'll finish the job,

830
01:01:03,827 --> 01:01:05,060
you friggin' whore.
(laughter)

831
01:01:05,062 --> 01:01:07,562
(whimpering)
- Please.

832
01:01:09,767 --> 01:01:11,433
I wouldn't rape a monkey.

833
01:01:19,743 --> 01:01:22,377
Go on, run, you black cunt!

834
01:01:22,379 --> 01:01:24,179
Run, run!!
(laughter)

835
01:01:24,181 --> 01:01:26,748
- Alright, you fuckin' bitch!
- You run on home!

836
01:01:26,750 --> 01:01:28,517
I know where you live!

837
01:01:28,519 --> 01:01:31,787
- Run, you black bitch!
- D'you want a fuckin' push?!

838
01:01:31,789 --> 01:01:34,756
(Skins shouting)
(car engine stalling)

839
01:01:34,758 --> 01:01:36,458
(laughter)

840
01:01:46,503 --> 01:01:49,538
That's the last fuckin' time
I go bingo on a Thursday.

841
01:01:49,540 --> 01:01:53,175
I reckon Dobsy's shagging the bingo caller.
Cow always wins the lucky draw.

842
01:01:53,177 --> 01:01:56,078
- That dirty slag.
- She is, though, don't you reckon?

843
01:01:56,080 --> 01:01:57,946
Yeah.
(laughter)

844
01:01:57,948 --> 01:02:00,849
- Oh, I need you to look after the kids next week.
- Again?

845
01:02:00,851 --> 01:02:02,951
- Why? Where you going?
- Never you mind. - Dave!

846
01:02:02,953 --> 01:02:06,088
- She got herself a little fancy man, ain't ya?
- Nah, she ain't.

847
01:02:06,090 --> 01:02:08,957
Why she got all that new stuff,
done herself right up.

848
01:02:08,959 --> 01:02:12,294
Bloody nosey, you are. (shouting in
distance) What's the matter with you?

849
01:02:12,296 --> 01:02:15,964
No. I ain't going up there.
Not near those pigs. They scare me.

850
01:02:15,966 --> 01:02:18,300
It ain't safe round here
no more.

851
01:02:18,302 --> 01:02:20,669
Them and them other lot of skinheads,
them Grays, run the bleeding streets now.

852
01:02:20,671 --> 01:02:22,304
Always picking on coloureds,
ain't they?

853
01:02:22,306 --> 01:02:24,239
Why don't they leave them
bloody alone?

854
01:02:24,241 --> 01:02:26,441
String 'em up and shoot them.
- Come on, Debs.

855
01:02:32,182 --> 01:02:34,015
Come on. Let's go this way.

856
01:02:34,852 --> 01:02:38,186
See what I mean? Don't know how
you keep your lot out of trouble.

857
01:02:38,188 --> 01:02:41,022
You deserve a medal, I tell ya.
(all shouting)

858
01:02:42,760 --> 01:02:44,426
We're not frightened!

859
01:02:44,428 --> 01:02:47,195
White bastards!
(all shouting)

860
01:03:00,711 --> 01:03:03,445

861
01:03:04,381 --> 01:03:06,748
Please, brother. Please.

862
01:03:06,750 --> 01:03:09,885
Please... Please, brother.

863
01:03:09,887 --> 01:03:12,220
- You sure it was him?
- 'Course I bloody am.

864
01:03:13,390 --> 01:03:15,957
I know he's been bunking school,
but now he's running with them lot.

865
01:03:15,959 --> 01:03:17,826
Come on, then! Come on.

866
01:03:17,828 --> 01:03:19,594
(shouting)

867
01:03:19,596 --> 01:03:22,697
Stop doing that.
Gimme that! Give it here!

868
01:03:22,699 --> 01:03:25,100
And you. Gimme this now. Now!

869
01:03:25,102 --> 01:03:28,103
(Enitan whistling)
- Fuck me.

870
01:03:28,105 --> 01:03:29,805
Must be payday.

871
01:03:31,074 --> 01:03:32,741
Give the money, coon.

872
01:03:34,912 --> 01:03:37,445
Them sailors are loaded.
(laughter)

873
01:03:44,855 --> 01:03:46,655
(laughter)

874
01:04:08,378 --> 01:04:10,712
(Ingrid):...bringing trouble to my door,
having authorities knocking.

875
01:04:10,714 --> 01:04:13,348
Come on, darling,
let's go have a word with him.

876
01:04:13,350 --> 01:04:15,183
What's all this
about you being suspended?

877
01:04:15,185 --> 01:04:17,819
You've been lying to me.
I've had the school round.

878
01:04:20,157 --> 01:04:22,858
Go downstairs, babe.
Go on. Go on.

879
01:04:26,096 --> 01:04:28,830
What's all this shit
you got on my walls?

880
01:04:44,948 --> 01:04:47,716
You've been running
with those yobo skins, ain't ya?

881
01:04:47,718 --> 01:04:50,819
Fighting with them sailors.
I saw you down the docks.

882
01:04:53,390 --> 01:04:57,058
You better not bring the bloody
law down on me, boy. I swear.

883
01:05:00,764 --> 01:05:02,430
I am the law.

884
01:05:13,977 --> 01:05:17,646
Ya know I always tried for ya,
didn't I, eh, boy?

885
01:05:18,949 --> 01:05:20,749
(sighing)

886
01:05:20,751 --> 01:05:22,884
Look, instead of running
with them yobo skins,

887
01:05:22,886 --> 01:05:25,820
why don't you come out
with Mummy like you used to?

888
01:05:25,822 --> 01:05:27,956
Who's that?

889
01:05:27,958 --> 01:05:30,258
Is that your girlfriend?

890
01:05:30,260 --> 01:05:31,826
She's nice.

891
01:05:33,096 --> 01:05:36,031
You could, um, you could...
give me that necklace I liked.

892
01:05:36,033 --> 01:05:39,334
Go nice with them other pieces
you got me a while back.

893
01:05:41,371 --> 01:05:42,804
My name's Eni.

894
01:05:45,375 --> 01:05:46,808
Not "boy."

895
01:05:48,679 --> 01:05:50,645
You ungrateful git.

896
01:05:51,348 --> 01:05:53,548
I knew I should never have
had you back.

897
01:05:53,550 --> 01:05:57,085
I should let you stay in Nigeria to rot,
let 'em cut you to ribbons.

898
01:05:58,622 --> 01:06:02,490
I put a roof over your head
and this is how you repay me?

899
01:06:02,492 --> 01:06:04,459
You don't appreciate
nothing I do.

900
01:06:05,595 --> 01:06:08,263
Well, you're 16 now.
You get caught again, you're on your own.

901
01:06:08,265 --> 01:06:10,966
I can kick your arse out
on the streets to go hungry.

902
01:06:10,968 --> 01:06:13,134
Bloody parents of yours
don't give me nothing.

903
01:06:13,136 --> 01:06:16,571
Don't know why I put up with you,
you selfish little bastard.

904
01:06:16,573 --> 01:06:18,840
Running with them yobo skins,
thinking you're something,

905
01:06:18,842 --> 01:06:21,376
beating up your own kind,
thinking they want you!

906
01:06:21,378 --> 01:06:23,244
They don't want you,
nobody wants you!

907
01:06:23,246 --> 01:06:26,247
I only took you so I could have
the bleedin' girls.

908
01:06:28,185 --> 01:06:31,252
I've got other kids
in this bedroom! Oh!

You're messing with Stan's
boy Spika over in Grays.

964
01:10:11,174 --> 01:10:13,374
Robbing a post office.

965

What you doing,
fighting each other?

972
01:10:28,992 --> 01:10:32,393
You and Spika went
to fucking school together.

973
01:10:32,395 --> 01:10:34,329
You should be clubbing together.

974

975
01:10:42,305 --> 01:10:44,072

01:12:37,387 --> 01:12:40,321
Why'd you hang round with them
when they hate you?

997
01:12:57,841 --> 01:12:59,574
You ain't like them.

998
01:13:01,978 --> 01:13:03,644
You're better.

999
01:13:05,382 --> 01:13:09,250

1000
01:13:21,264 --> 01:13:22,897
You scared about Levi?

1001
01:13:24,601 --> 01:13:26,334
He don't care about me.

1002
01:13:27,504 --> 01:13:29,437
He don't care about nothing.

1003
01:13:32,375 --> 01:13:34,108
I seen you looking at me.

1004
01:13:36,179 --> 01:13:37,912
I know you like me.

1005
01:13:47,657 --> 01:13:49,824
Oil and water don't mix.

01:13:51,928 --> 01:13:53,561
Nah.

1007
01:13:54,764 --> 01:13:56,631

01:16:58,748 --> 01:17:00,948
Bastards. He's only a boy.

1024
01:17:00,950 --> 01:17:03,584
- Get that filth out of here.
- Fuck off. Come on.

1025
01:17:03,586 --> 01:17:06,387
You should be ashamed,
bringing shit like that over here.

1026
01:17:06,389 --> 01:17:08,356
- Come on.
- Scum.

1027
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:46,794
(Skins shouting)

1028
01:17:46,796 --> 01:17:49,597
(cries of panic) - Come to Nana.
Come here to Nana.

1029
01:17:49,599 --> 01:17:51,265
Alright, darling,
come to Nanny.

1030
01:17:53,870 --> 01:17:56,370
No, Ing. Don't go out there!
You can't go out there!

1031
01:17:56,372 --> 01:17:59,473
- I ain't scared of them pigs.
- Ing, stop!

1032
01:18:01,678 --> 01:18:04,412
You big boys got nothing better
to do than hang around with kids?

1033
01:18:04,414 --> 01:18:06,881
He ain't coming out,
so you can fuck off.

1034
01:18:06,883 --> 01:18:08,916
Mum, come inside!

1035
01:18:08,918 --> 01:18:11,018
Fucking wog lover!
(laughter)

1036
01:18:12,822 --> 01:18:15,056
(Skins shouting)
- Bastards!

1037
01:18:15,758 --> 01:18:18,459
Pay for that, you spineless git.
Wait till my Jack gets home.

1038
01:18:18,461 --> 01:18:20,327
Wog!

1039
01:18:20,329 --> 01:18:22,863
- Come here. Come here.
- I want my mum! - No, no, come on.

1040
01:18:22,865 --> 01:18:25,166
Out here now!

1041
01:18:25,168 --> 01:18:26,734
Business!

1042
01:18:33,743 --> 01:18:36,043
Fuck off before I call the law!
Wait, wait.

1043
01:18:36,045 --> 01:18:37,712
Back inside.

1044
01:18:37,714 --> 01:18:39,513
Back inside!

1045
01:18:41,417 --> 01:18:42,817
Fuck off.

1046
01:18:46,823 --> 01:18:48,556
Don't you come back!

1047
01:18:50,960 --> 01:18:53,160
Don't you fucking come back!!

1048
01:18:53,162 --> 01:18:54,895
(Skins shouting)

1049
01:18:56,766 --> 01:19:00,668
(all chanting): Tilbury!
Tilbury! Tilbury! Tilbury!

1050
01:19:13,783 --> 01:19:16,751
(Gray Skins chanting):
Tilbury: kill them all!

1051
01:19:16,753 --> 01:19:20,454
Tilbury: kill them all!
Tilbury: kill them all!

1052
01:19:21,891 --> 01:19:24,792
That's why no one messes
with his girl.

1053
01:19:29,198 --> 01:19:33,033
Told him it's too early for a rematch.
We're still fucking hurt.

1054
01:19:34,270 --> 01:19:37,404
They've probably pulled out
everything they've got.

1055
01:19:37,406 --> 01:19:39,373
Who are we?!
(all): Gray Skins!

1056
01:19:39,375 --> 01:19:41,242
(chanting continues)

1057
01:19:42,311 --> 01:19:47,214
(all chanting): Tilbury!
Tilbury! Tilbury! Tilbury!

1058
01:19:47,216 --> 01:19:50,351
Tilbury Skins! Tilbury Skins!

1059
01:19:50,353 --> 01:19:52,453
(chanting continues)

1060
01:20:02,765 --> 01:20:06,967
(Ingrid): <i>He's gotta go. If he gets
done in or banged up one more time,</i>

1061
01:20:06,969 --> 01:20:09,804
<i>they'll come for me.
They'll take me kids and everything.</i>

1062
01:20:09,806 --> 01:20:12,239
I'll have him arrested,
that's what I'll do.

1063
01:20:12,241 --> 01:20:14,041
You what?

1064
01:20:14,043 --> 01:20:16,143
I'm gonna set the law on him,
have him arrested,

1065
01:20:16,145 --> 01:20:18,612
and I'll call his Nigerian parents
to come and take him back.

1066
01:20:18,614 --> 01:20:20,080
You sure?

1067
01:20:20,082 --> 01:20:22,716
We're gypsies.
We don't deal with the law.

1068
01:20:22,718 --> 01:20:25,152
(indistinct chatter)
- Come on.

1069
01:20:27,490 --> 01:20:30,124
You think Levi'll have him?

1070
01:20:30,126 --> 01:20:32,827
That Masher's a fucking psycho.

1071
01:20:32,829 --> 01:20:34,829
I thought
he was still locked up.

1072
01:20:39,268 --> 01:20:40,768
Come on!!

1073
01:20:42,371 --> 01:20:43,971
Wog.

1074
01:20:43,973 --> 01:20:46,807
(all chanting): We want the wog!
We want the wog!

1075
01:20:48,177 --> 01:20:52,012
They want to fight the coon
'cause he burnt Spika!

1076
01:20:53,950 --> 01:20:57,117
(chanting continues)

1077
01:20:58,387 --> 01:20:59,887
Got a bottle, coon?

1078
01:21:02,758 --> 01:21:04,959
Just get him down.

1079
01:21:04,961 --> 01:21:06,827
- Levi?
- What you doing?

1080
01:21:06,829 --> 01:21:08,829
(chanting continues)
- Lev.

1081
01:21:09,966 --> 01:21:11,665
You can't let the coon go.

1082
01:21:13,769 --> 01:21:15,836
Lev! He's a coon!

1083
01:21:16,572 --> 01:21:18,873
(chanting continues)

1084
01:21:21,978 --> 01:21:24,378
Lev, what are you doing?

1085
01:21:24,380 --> 01:21:27,014
(all chanting): Tilbury Skins!
Tilbury Skins!

1086
01:21:29,418 --> 01:21:31,318
(roaring)

1087
01:21:32,255 --> 01:21:35,456
(beat-heavy music)

1088
01:21:48,204 --> 01:21:50,437
(Gray Skins chanting)

1089
01:22:05,855 --> 01:22:08,555
Yeah, yeah!
(all): Yeah, yeah!

1090
01:22:19,502 --> 01:22:21,035
(can clattering)

1091
01:22:34,083 --> 01:22:36,116
(Ingrid): I want 'em arrested.

1092
01:22:36,118 --> 01:22:38,552
They put a brick through me window.
They've got hammers and knives.

1093
01:22:38,554 --> 01:22:41,722
I'm scared they're gonna do me and
me kids an injury. Lock 'em up.

1094
01:22:45,294 --> 01:22:47,661
(music playing)
(Skins shouting)

1095
01:22:50,599 --> 01:22:52,366
(indistinct chatter)

1096
01:23:04,213 --> 01:23:07,614
- Yeah!!
- Yeah, yeah!! - Yeah, yeah!!!

1097
01:23:07,616 --> 01:23:10,651
(all chanting): Tilbury Skins!
Tilbury Skins!

1098
01:23:16,492 --> 01:23:19,326
I'll be in the fucking gazette tomorrow!
(laughing)

1099
01:23:20,963 --> 01:23:22,830
(skin shouting)

1100
01:23:26,669 --> 01:23:28,702
You let 'em beat me up.

1101
01:23:28,704 --> 01:23:31,238
You left me.
(mutterings)

1102
01:23:32,575 --> 01:23:34,141
(laughter)

1103
01:23:37,079 --> 01:23:40,247
Why'd you leave me?
(laughter)

1104
01:23:40,249 --> 01:23:45,586
You think I'd let...
a fucking monkey lead Tilbury?

1105
01:23:45,588 --> 01:23:47,021
(laughter)

1106
01:23:50,960 --> 01:23:52,826
You black cunt.

1107
01:23:56,766 --> 01:23:58,232
Black cunt.

1108
01:24:04,173 --> 01:24:05,806
Black cunt!

1109
01:24:07,076 --> 01:24:09,276
Black fucking cunt!

1110
01:24:15,951 --> 01:24:18,052
Sh-sh-shitter.

1111
01:24:18,054 --> 01:24:20,254
- Oh...
- Let's kill the fucker.

1112
01:24:20,256 --> 01:24:22,156
(all shouting)

1113
01:24:28,764 --> 01:24:32,066
Kill the black bastard.
(indistinct chatter)

1114
01:24:50,853 --> 01:24:53,253
Come on! Fuck!
(silent shouting)

1115
01:24:53,255 --> 01:24:55,255
(crying out)
Come on!

1116
01:24:55,257 --> 01:24:57,691
(grunting)

1117
01:24:59,595 --> 01:25:00,994

1118
01:25:08,871 --> 01:25:11,238
(screaming)
(groaning)

1119
01:25:12,675 --> 01:25:15,275
(gasping)

1120
01:26:12,768 --> 01:26:14,434
Tilbury Skins.

1121
01:26:15,771 --> 01:26:17,638
Tilbury Skins.

1122
01:26:19,575 --> 01:26:21,308
Tilbury Skins.
(groaning)

1123
01:26:23,312 --> 01:26:25,245
Tilbury Skins.

1124
01:26:27,683 --> 01:26:29,116
Tilbury Skins.

1125
01:26:30,853 --> 01:26:32,452
Tilbury Skins.

1126
01:26:34,490 --> 01:26:36,590
Tilbury Skins...

1127
01:26:36,592 --> 01:26:38,025
Tilbury Skins.

1128
01:26:38,761 --> 01:26:40,460

01:26:40,829 --> 01:26:42,763
Tilbury Skins!

1130
01:26:43,165 --> 01:26:44,898
Tilbury Skins!

1131
01:26:45,601 --> 01:26:47,501
Tilbury Skins!

1132
01:27:25,307 --> 01:27:28,308
You haven't seen him!
You don't know what you're talking about!

1133
01:27:28,310 --> 01:27:29,710
I do know.
(child screaming)

1134
01:27:29,712 --> 01:27:31,144
Alright, then.

1135
01:27:32,581 --> 01:27:35,515
Here, I've called the police.
Don't you come in here.

1136
01:27:35,517 --> 01:27:37,818
I warned you don't come back.

1137
01:27:42,157 --> 01:27:44,758
Don't you dare come in here.
Don't you dare come in here!

1138
01:27:44,760 --> 01:27:46,560
Stop it! Stop it!

1139
01:27:46,562 --> 01:27:48,428

1140
01:27:49,965 --> 01:27:54,201

01:27:54,203 --> 01:27:55,836
- Ing, stop it!
- They're coming!

1142
01:27:55,838 --> 01:27:57,804
Didn't think I'd do it,
but I have!

1143
01:27:57,806 --> 01:28:00,240
I've called them and they're coming!
(all shouting)

1144
01:28:00,242 --> 01:28:03,443
Stop it!! Stop it!
(siren wailing) - They're here.

1145
01:28:04,947 --> 01:28:06,747
(barking)
He's over there.

1146
01:28:06,749 --> 01:28:09,316
- Where is he?
- He's there. He's hid behind there.

1147
01:28:11,754 --> 01:28:14,755
- Come here.
- Fuck off, you fucking pigs!

1148
01:28:14,757 --> 01:28:17,157
Fuck off!!

1149
01:28:17,159 --> 01:28:20,494
I told you not to call the law!

Fuck you! You never loved me,

Give me my fucking snake!

1154
01:29:01,637 --> 01:29:03,036
GBH.

1155
01:29:03,972 --> 01:29:06,306
No witnesses.
You're a lucky boy.

1156
01:29:06,308 --> 01:29:09,109
Do you want
to file a complaint?

1157
01:29:12,381 --> 01:29:14,014
You got one chance.

1158
01:29:15,184 --> 01:29:17,818
I'd grab it with both hands
if I was you.

1159
01:29:18,287 --> 01:29:20,921
I hate these friggin' places.
What's taking so bloody long?

1160
01:29:20,923 --> 01:29:23,590
Defendant to be released into
the custody of natural parents.

1161
01:29:23,592 --> 01:29:25,492
Jesus Christ, baby,
look at this.

1162
01:29:25,494 --> 01:29:27,828
See, I told ya. Look at him.

1163
01:29:30,499 --> 01:29:32,766
- What have you done to my son?
- Don't you go whining.

1164
01:29:32,768 --> 01:29:35,202
You could've done a better job
on the pittance you sent me,

1165
01:29:35,204 --> 01:29:36,670
you should have brought him up
yourself.

1166
01:29:36,672 --> 01:29:38,538
No, no, no,
we had an agreement.

1167
01:29:38,540 --> 01:29:41,141
- You got what you paid for.
- I trusted you!

1168
01:29:44,346 --> 01:29:45,746
Are you okay?

1169
01:29:45,748 --> 01:29:47,447
Fuck off, coon.

1170
01:29:48,183 --> 01:29:50,617
Tilbury Skins. Tilbury Skins!

1173
01:29:54,323 --> 01:29:56,256
(Talu screaming)

1174
01:29:56,258 --> 01:29:57,924
For fucks...

1175
01:29:57,926 --> 01:30:00,394
- Get off of me!
- Jack, leave him.

1176
01:30:00,396 --> 01:30:01,828
Jack, don't get him.

1177
01:30:45,541 --> 01:30:47,307
(groaning)
- Come on, then.

1178
01:30:48,377 --> 01:30:51,244
Wo... wo... woggy, woggies.
Sta-station.

1179
01:30:51,246 --> 01:30:52,913
- Come on!
- Out, out.

1180
01:30:52,915 --> 01:30:55,382

01:30:55,384 --> 01:30:58,218
- Social. Social. Woggy, coon.
- He said the wog's out.

1182
01:30:58,220 --> 01:31:01,254
Broke out the pig station,
the old bills looking for him.

1183
01:31:01,256 --> 01:31:03,457
Social, social.
I saw him by the social.

1184
01:31:03,459 --> 01:31:05,158
- Come on!
- He won't go home.

1185
01:31:05,160 --> 01:31:08,628
The wog lover shopped him
to the old bill.

1186
01:31:08,630 --> 01:31:10,931
Fuck black cunt.
Levi's in hospital.

1187
01:31:10,933 --> 01:31:13,266
You're the new leader now,
Bomb.

1188
01:31:13,268 --> 01:31:15,235
Yeah. I'll make it official.

1189
01:31:17,172 --> 01:31:18,905
I know where the coon'll be.

1190
01:31:45,767 --> 01:31:47,434
Sign this, please.

1191
01:32:01,083 --> 01:32:02,949
You need to listen to me.

1192
01:32:02,951 --> 01:32:05,752
He's assaulted two officers,
now they're on his toes.

1193
01:32:05,754 --> 01:32:08,021
I need to know where he's gone.

1194
01:32:40,956 --> 01:32:42,656
(Fathead): Come on!

1195
01:32:43,292 --> 01:32:44,824
Th-this way.

1196
01:32:49,131 --> 01:32:51,031
Co-come on.
(laughing)

1197
01:33:09,451 --> 01:33:11,284
- Gonna skin him?
- Skin him.

1198
01:33:11,286 --> 01:33:14,487
Get that shiv and stick it up him, yeah?
(laughter)

1199
01:33:14,489 --> 01:33:17,157
- Skin him.
- Stop talking, mate.

1200
01:33:18,260 --> 01:33:20,994
When I see him,
I'm gonna... rip him apart.

1201
01:34:02,170 --> 01:34:03,603
Fuck.

1202
01:34:04,973 --> 01:34:07,641
- Coon noosed himself.
- Swinging like a monkey.

1203
01:34:09,244 --> 01:34:11,945
(sirens wailing)
- Police. Police.

1204
01:34:12,948 --> 01:34:15,348
Come on.
(sirens wailing)

1205
01:35:23,585 --> 01:35:25,018
Hello, Eni.

1206
01:35:37,599 --> 01:35:40,433
I received a call
from your foster mother, Ingrid.

1207
01:35:44,072 --> 01:35:46,506
I...

1208
01:35:46,508 --> 01:35:49,642
I'd like to welcome you
to Brighty Institute, Eni.

1209
01:35:52,581 --> 01:35:54,481
I'm a teacher here now.

1210
01:35:58,520 --> 01:36:02,088
The mandate here at Brighty
is better suited to pupils

1211
01:36:02,090 --> 01:36:04,224
who need extra support.

1212
01:36:05,560 --> 01:36:07,227
Like you.

1213
01:36:09,030 --> 01:36:12,232
Your Nigerian parents have provided
a stipendiary for your education.

1214
01:36:12,768 --> 01:36:16,503
This stipendiary enabled your
release from juvenile detention.

1215
01:36:16,505 --> 01:36:18,571
A condition of this stipendiary
is that you study law,

1216
01:36:18,573 --> 01:36:20,540
the same
as your Nigerian father.

1217
01:36:20,542 --> 01:36:22,876
Books have been provided
for your studies.

1218
01:36:24,212 --> 01:36:25,745
Eni?

1219
01:36:28,250 --> 01:36:29,816
Eni.

1220
01:36:30,952 --> 01:36:32,452
Eni.

1221
01:36:33,588 --> 01:36:35,021
It's okay.

1222
01:36:39,961 --> 01:36:41,828
I know it's a lot.

1223
01:36:45,100 --> 01:36:48,535
I cannot know
all that you have been through,

1224
01:36:48,537 --> 01:36:54,040
but I do know that every day
we get to make a new choice.

1225
01:36:57,245 --> 01:36:58,945
If you trust me...

1226
01:36:59,948 --> 01:37:02,448
...I will help you
make that choice.

1227
01:37:05,587 --> 01:37:07,187
Can't.

1228
01:37:16,264 --> 01:37:17,897
I believe in you.

1229
01:37:20,969 --> 01:37:24,637
I believe
that you can make this turn...

1230
01:37:26,575 --> 01:37:28,141
...if you try.

1231
01:37:32,047 --> 01:37:34,147
I want us to try.

1232
01:37:35,383 --> 01:37:36,850
Together.

1233
01:37:40,956 --> 01:37:42,655
I can't.

1234
01:37:43,391 --> 01:37:44,824
I can't.

1235
01:37:45,493 --> 01:37:47,026
Can't.

1236
01:37:49,197 --> 01:37:51,331
It's okay. It's okay.

1237
01:37:56,171 --> 01:37:57,637
It's okay.

1238
01:37:58,506 --> 01:37:59,873
Eni.

1239
01:38:02,978 --> 01:38:04,444
It's okay.

1240
01:38:11,353 --> 01:38:12,919
It's okay.

1241
01:38:19,494 --> 01:38:21,127
This is your weapon now.

1242
01:38:26,301 --> 01:38:28,034
No!! Oh, God!

1243
01:38:35,977 --> 01:38:37,443
It's okay.

1244
01:38:41,249 --> 01:38:43,182
(shushing)
- I'm nothing.

1245
01:38:43,184 --> 01:38:45,585
It's okay.
(shushing)

1246
01:38:45,587 --> 01:38:46,986
It's okay.

1247
01:38:48,156 --> 01:38:50,823
- I-I can't. I'm a coon.
- It's okay.

1248
01:38:53,762 --> 01:38:55,428
I'm a coon.

1249
01:38:59,267 --> 01:39:01,034
I'm a coon.

1250
01:39:25,327 --> 01:39:27,860
(soft music)

1251
01:39:46,247 --> 01:39:48,948
(soft music continues)

1252
01:40:46,975 --> 01:40:49,809
There's nothing you cannot
achieve now, Enitan.

1253
01:40:53,581 --> 01:40:55,448
(cheering)

1254
01:41:09,597 --> 01:41:11,030
Thank you.

1255
01:41:43,264 --> 01:41:45,031
(applause)

1256
01:43:27,969 --> 01:43:30,236
