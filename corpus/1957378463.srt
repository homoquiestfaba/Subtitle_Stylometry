00:00:57,014 --> 00:00:59,682
- [David] Hey, Jessica.
- Oh, hey! He has arrived.

5
00:00:59,817 --> 00:01:02,353
- Okay, love you too. Bye. Hi!
- Hi!

6
00:01:02,485 --> 00:01:04,521
- Are you Mr. Ashland, I guess?
- Yes.

7
00:01:04,655 --> 00:01:06,691
- Uh, David, please call me David.
- Okay, David.

8
00:01:06,823 --> 00:01:08,091
Sorry, I'm a little nervous

9
00:01:08,224 --> 00:01:09,860
because I didn't know,
you're going to have a camera.

10
00:01:09,993 --> 00:01:13,430
Well, I always keep my camera
with me because I never know

11
00:01:13,563 --> 00:01:16,133
when I'm going
to catch the next big star.

12
00:01:16,266 --> 00:01:18,501
Oh! Well, hopefully I'm it.
Ha, ha.

13
00:01:18,635 --> 00:01:20,438
Well, you look absolutely great.

14
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:22,072
You mind if I just get a shot
of you here?

15
00:01:22,206 --> 00:01:22,974
[Jessica] Well, okay.

16
00:01:24,108 --> 00:01:26,710
Stunning! Wow, you look awesome.

17
00:01:26,843 --> 00:01:30,013
[somber music playing]

18
00:02:29,139 --> 00:02:31,875
[music fades]

19
00:02:38,481 --> 00:02:39,651
[David breathes heavily]

20
00:03:01,938 --> 00:03:04,608
[knocking on door, lock clicks]

21
00:03:05,675 --> 00:03:07,944
[David] Well, hello there.
Welcome to Dallas.

22
00:03:08,079 --> 00:03:09,580
Hi!

23
00:03:09,713 --> 00:03:13,417
- How are you?
- I'm well. How are you?

24
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:15,385
- You found it all right?
- I did, yeah.

25
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:19,156
It was, uh, a little tricky on
the back roads, but it's fine.

26
00:03:19,289 --> 00:03:22,259
Well, I hope you don't mind that
I've got this camera going on,

27
00:03:22,393 --> 00:03:25,496
but, um, it's all part
of my audition process.

28
00:03:25,628 --> 00:03:27,230
So, if you would tell me
your name.

29
00:03:27,364 --> 00:03:29,533
[chuckles]
Laci Lee Bateman.

30
00:03:29,665 --> 00:03:32,635
Laci Lee Bateman,
isn't that something.

31
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:37,808
You are a hundred million times
prettier than your pictures,

32
00:03:37,942 --> 00:03:39,143
- I have to tell you that.
- [laughs]

33
00:03:39,276 --> 00:03:41,478
- Thank you.
- Look at you!

34
00:03:41,611 --> 00:03:44,814
- Oh.
- Oh, wow! My, my!

35
00:03:44,948 --> 00:03:46,817
All right, um, would you like
to have a seat over here?

36
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:50,921
[Laci] Um, thank you so much,
yeah. Uh, Mr. Ashland, right?

37
00:03:51,955 --> 00:03:53,289
- [David] David.
- David.

38
00:03:53,424 --> 00:03:56,326
Call me David, please and, yes,
I'm glad you remembered my name.

39
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:57,493
David, hi!

40
00:03:57,627 --> 00:04:03,132
So, um, well,
I hope you don't mind me

41
00:04:03,266 --> 00:04:05,635
filming you like this right
now but the whole point...

42
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:06,804
No, natural in front
of the camera.

43
00:04:06,937 --> 00:04:08,037
[David laughs]

44
00:04:08,171 --> 00:04:11,608
Uh, good, good.
I'm glad to hear that.

45
00:04:11,741 --> 00:04:15,211
Um, the whole point
of me doing this is now, um...

46
00:04:15,346 --> 00:04:18,182
I'm, uh, auditioning

47
00:04:18,314 --> 00:04:23,319
for the first reality
feature film.

48
00:04:23,454 --> 00:04:24,555
Wow!

49
00:04:24,687 --> 00:04:26,856
So, um, it's important

50
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:32,329
that I keep my, uh,
actors on film

51
00:04:32,461 --> 00:04:33,596
as long as I can, you know,

52
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:35,999
and I'm trying to see

53
00:04:36,132 --> 00:04:38,201
how they interact
with people all day long

54
00:04:38,336 --> 00:04:39,836
with a camera on them all day.

55
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:42,239
Oh, okay. Yeah,
it's absolutely understandable.

56
00:04:42,372 --> 00:04:46,744
- So, um... So how old are you?
- I am 19.

57
00:04:46,877 --> 00:04:48,913
- 19 years old, wow!
- Yeah.

58
00:04:49,045 --> 00:04:53,216
Well, uh,
you don't look 19 but...

59
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:56,086
I know, everyone tells me.
I get one of two reactions.

60
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:59,490
I either get you look
15 or you look 24.

61
00:04:59,622 --> 00:05:04,027
So I'm kind of wondering
where I place in that range.

62
00:05:04,161 --> 00:05:07,596
Wow, you are just stunning.

63
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:09,432
- Thank you.
- I'm sorry. I just, uh...

64
00:05:09,565 --> 00:05:10,399
You make me blush.

65
00:05:10,533 --> 00:05:11,868
[David laughs]

66
00:05:12,002 --> 00:05:14,739
Well, I didn't expect you
to be so damn beautiful, God!

67
00:05:14,872 --> 00:05:16,107
[laughs]
Thank you.

68
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,775
- So, uh...
- Yeah.

69
00:05:18,908 --> 00:05:21,077
Tell me a little bit
about yourself right now.

70
00:05:21,211 --> 00:05:24,682
Um, okay. Uh, my name
is Laci Lee Bateman...

71
00:05:24,814 --> 00:05:26,684
- Mm-hmm.
- ...and I'm from Oklahoma.

72
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:30,653
- And, um...
- Let me guess.

73
00:05:30,786 --> 00:05:32,856
- What?
- Durant.

74
00:05:33,658 --> 00:05:36,527
Yeah, actually.
How did you know that?

75
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:39,063
Oh, just, uh, inkling suspicion.

76
00:05:39,196 --> 00:05:41,065
I guess us Durantians, you know,

77
00:05:41,197 --> 00:05:46,802
have a tendency to...
to display, uh, certain qualities.

78
00:05:46,937 --> 00:05:50,941
So, okay, and are you still
living in Durant now?

79
00:05:51,074 --> 00:05:56,713
Um, I actually, I'm trying right
now to move, uh, out to Los Angeles

80
00:05:56,846 --> 00:05:58,681
but it's so expensive.

81
00:05:58,815 --> 00:06:01,117
I mean,
I've been working for a while.

82
00:06:01,252 --> 00:06:04,254
I've just been trying
to do all that so, you know.

83
00:06:04,387 --> 00:06:08,358
- So, let me guess, Los Angeles.
- Yeah.

84
00:06:09,293 --> 00:06:12,629
- To pursue your acting career?
- Acting career, yeah.

85
00:06:12,762 --> 00:06:16,733
Um, I... You know, I...
I did a lot of the plays in high school

86
00:06:16,867 --> 00:06:21,305
and I took all the
drama classes, and it was, um...

87
00:06:21,437 --> 00:06:24,807
It was a really, really,
good experience and I absolutely loved it.

88
00:06:24,942 --> 00:06:28,778
So, um, I would be really happy
if I could be an actress.

89
00:06:28,911 --> 00:06:34,418
That's why I responded to your,
uh... your lovely, um...

90
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:37,221
- I'm sorry, I'm so nervous.
- That's okay.

91
00:06:37,353 --> 00:06:39,889
- My ad in the paper.
- Yeah, your ad in the paper.

92
00:06:40,024 --> 00:06:43,360
Well, I'm certainly happy
that you answered it.

93
00:06:44,127 --> 00:06:45,228
Thank you.

94
00:06:45,362 --> 00:06:48,064
So, um, anything else
you want to tell me

95
00:06:48,197 --> 00:06:49,366
about yourself right now?

96
00:06:50,166 --> 00:06:51,968
Like what?

97
00:06:52,101 --> 00:06:56,373
Well, are you the only sibling
in your family?

98
00:06:56,507 --> 00:06:58,175
Oh, no,
I have a younger brother.

99
00:06:58,307 --> 00:06:59,310
Oh, you do.

100
00:06:59,442 --> 00:07:02,645
And his name is Hunter
and he's ten.

101
00:07:02,778 --> 00:07:04,781
- Wow.
- So he's... he's... he's cool.

102
00:07:04,915 --> 00:07:07,051
And then I...
I had an older sister.

103
00:07:07,184 --> 00:07:08,185
Um, but...

104
00:07:10,454 --> 00:07:11,788
I hope you don't mind me,
you know,

105
00:07:11,922 --> 00:07:13,991
- walking around you and such.
- No, it's fine.

106
00:07:14,124 --> 00:07:17,228
I just, um,
want to get all angles of you.

107
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,396
So, let me tell you
what I had in mind.

108
00:07:19,529 --> 00:07:21,064
I'd love that.

109
00:07:21,197 --> 00:07:24,567
I'm auditioning for a feature film of...
A reality feature film.

110
00:07:24,701 --> 00:07:27,805
Kind of like a reality
TV show but a movie.

111
00:07:27,937 --> 00:07:29,205
Um...

112
00:07:29,338 --> 00:07:34,678
I would like to follow you
around during the day

113
00:07:34,812 --> 00:07:38,215
or part of the day
and, um, with the camera on you,

114
00:07:38,348 --> 00:07:42,552
and to see how you interact
with people,

115
00:07:42,687 --> 00:07:46,057
and things and me with a camera
on you the whole time.

116
00:07:46,189 --> 00:07:47,757
I think, I'll be
very comfortable with that.

117
00:07:47,891 --> 00:07:50,127
That...
that sounds really quite nice.

118
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,794
So, what do you say
we get going.

119
00:07:51,927 --> 00:07:53,230
Okay.

120
00:07:53,363 --> 00:07:58,435
And, um, you know, let's just
have a leisure afternoon

121
00:07:58,567 --> 00:08:00,803
and we'll get to know
each other better, okay?

122
00:08:00,937 --> 00:08:02,239
- That sounds wonderful.
- All right.

123
00:08:02,372 --> 00:08:05,475
Okay, let's go. So, yeah,
I'm just parked up there so.

124
00:08:05,608 --> 00:08:07,944
I'm parked on the street.
I hope that's okay.

125
00:08:08,077 --> 00:08:10,813
- Yeah, that's fine.
- Oh. Um...

126
00:08:10,947 --> 00:08:12,182
- [David] Here, I got it.
- Okay.

127
00:08:12,315 --> 00:08:15,085
[lock clicks]

128
00:08:16,052 --> 00:08:16,921
- [Laci] Great.
- After you.

129
00:08:17,053 --> 00:08:18,355
[Laci]
Thank you so much.

130
00:08:20,591 --> 00:08:21,692
Steep stairs.

131
00:08:23,026 --> 00:08:26,297
- [David] Be careful, now.
- It's all right. I'm a dancer.

132
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:29,966
[somber music playing]

133
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:32,002
[David] Thank you so much
for being here.

134
00:08:32,134 --> 00:08:33,537
[Katie] Thank you.

135
00:08:33,671 --> 00:08:36,607
[David] So just have a seat
there while I shut the door.

136
00:08:37,607 --> 00:08:39,476
- Perfect, perfect.
- [Katie] Okay.

137
00:08:40,811 --> 00:08:42,379
All right, wow!

138
00:08:42,513 --> 00:08:43,614
[laughs]

139
00:08:43,746 --> 00:08:45,814
Do you mind
taking your hair down for me?

140
00:08:45,948 --> 00:08:48,651
Um, sure. It's...
it's a little bit messy.

141
00:08:48,785 --> 00:08:51,220
- Is that okay?
- I doubt that.

142
00:08:51,355 --> 00:08:52,423
Wow!

143
00:08:54,057 --> 00:08:55,926
Wow! Okay. All right.

144
00:08:56,058 --> 00:08:57,760
So, you know,
I'm really, really, happy

145
00:08:57,894 --> 00:09:00,596
you answered my...
posting for my audition.

146
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:02,099
Yeah, yeah.

147
00:09:02,231 --> 00:09:05,034
You said something about, um,
a reality movie or reality show.

148
00:09:05,168 --> 00:09:06,635
Yeah, a reality film.

149
00:09:06,769 --> 00:09:09,572
You know,
I'm booking natural girls

150
00:09:09,706 --> 00:09:11,808
being as natural as possible,
you know.

151
00:09:11,942 --> 00:09:14,311
And to let their beauty shine
through, you know.

152
00:09:14,445 --> 00:09:16,480
That's what's important.
Everything's real, all right?

153
00:09:16,613 --> 00:09:19,950
Natural acting will scratch
that not actual acting.

154
00:09:20,083 --> 00:09:23,586
Just beautiful girls
being themselves, okay?

155
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:26,322
Well, is there a plot or is...
is it...?

156
00:09:26,456 --> 00:09:28,424
Well, yeah.
That's the neat thing.

157
00:09:28,558 --> 00:09:31,627
I'm letting the girls
tell the story.

158
00:09:31,761 --> 00:09:33,062
- Okay.
- All right?

159
00:09:33,196 --> 00:09:35,465
That's a really good idea
Mr. Ashland. Ha, ha.

160
00:09:35,599 --> 00:09:38,033
- David, please call me David.
- Okay, David.

161
00:09:38,168 --> 00:09:41,370
All right. Okay.
So, let's get started.

162
00:09:41,504 --> 00:09:43,072
Okay,
so if you can just hold that

163
00:09:43,206 --> 00:09:44,640
just right under
your chin there.

164
00:09:44,774 --> 00:09:45,842
[giggles]

165
00:09:46,976 --> 00:09:48,644
And if you could
state your name.

166
00:09:48,778 --> 00:09:50,080
I'm Katie Summers.

167
00:09:50,647 --> 00:09:53,583
- And, uh, how old are you, Katie?
- I'm 20 years old.

168
00:09:53,716 --> 00:09:55,718
- I just turned 20.
- 20 years old, wow!

169
00:09:55,852 --> 00:09:57,653
One more year and I can drink.

170
00:09:57,788 --> 00:10:00,289
Oh, I doubt that.
I'm sure you've been drinking.

171
00:10:00,423 --> 00:10:01,257
[laughs]

172
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:02,959
Okay. All right.

173
00:10:03,092 --> 00:10:06,262
So, um, now I know I told you
there was not a script here.

174
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:07,364
- Mm-hmm.
- All right?

175
00:10:07,498 --> 00:10:08,999
But
it's really, really, important

176
00:10:09,131 --> 00:10:11,367
that I see how my actors
respond to the script

177
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:12,635
that I'm going to give you.

178
00:10:12,769 --> 00:10:13,802
- Okay?
- Okay.

179
00:10:13,937 --> 00:10:15,371
So, I don't want you
to look at it now

180
00:10:15,504 --> 00:10:17,439
because I want to...
want it to be spontaneous.

181
00:10:17,573 --> 00:10:18,708
- Okay.
- All right.

182
00:10:18,841 --> 00:10:20,610
So, I want you to read it

183
00:10:20,744 --> 00:10:22,745
as if you were
a demented serial killer.

184
00:10:22,879 --> 00:10:24,447
- Ha, ha, okay.
- Okay?

185
00:10:24,581 --> 00:10:27,317
And you are taunting the media.
You're taunting cops.

186
00:10:27,451 --> 00:10:28,918
You're taunting everybody

187
00:10:29,052 --> 00:10:31,654
and, uh, you're making sort of
a game out of it, okay?

188
00:10:31,788 --> 00:10:33,757
That's really important.
You're making a game out of it.

189
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:35,525
- Okay.
- All right?

190
00:10:35,658 --> 00:10:39,729
Okay, so, uh, just be, a darker,
hot, demented version of yourself.

191
00:10:39,863 --> 00:10:41,598
- Okay.
- Okay?

192
00:10:41,731 --> 00:10:42,631
Like, you're a serial killer.

193
00:10:42,765 --> 00:10:43,933
- Okay.
- Okay.

194
00:10:44,067 --> 00:10:45,735
So, when I say go,
I want you to go, all right?

195
00:10:45,869 --> 00:10:46,670
- Okay.
- You ready?

196
00:10:46,803 --> 00:10:48,838
- Yeah.
- Okay go.

197
00:10:52,676 --> 00:10:56,780
Do you like to watch?
Do you like to play?

198
00:10:56,913 --> 00:10:59,783
Then get ready
for my little game.

199
00:10:59,917 --> 00:11:01,886
I'll audition each girl.

200
00:11:02,751 --> 00:11:04,420
For now, there will be five

201
00:11:04,554 --> 00:11:06,989
and if you pay attention
to the clues

202
00:11:07,124 --> 00:11:10,728
they just might get out alive,
or not.

203
00:11:12,328 --> 00:11:13,529
[laughs]

204
00:11:13,663 --> 00:11:14,730
Is that... is that okay?

205
00:11:14,865 --> 00:11:15,831
You want me...
I can do it again.

206
00:11:15,966 --> 00:11:17,734
- That was great.
- Okay.

207
00:11:17,868 --> 00:11:19,670
You know, I couldn't have said
it better myself.

208
00:11:19,802 --> 00:11:22,806
[somber music playing]

209
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:25,475
Now, don't forget, um,
I have to open the door for you

210
00:11:25,609 --> 00:11:27,511
because it doesn't work, so.

211
00:11:27,644 --> 00:11:28,711
- [David laughs]
- [car alarm buzzes]

212
00:11:28,846 --> 00:11:30,080
- [David] Okay.
- Sorry.

213
00:11:30,214 --> 00:11:30,981
[David laughs]

214
00:11:31,115 --> 00:11:32,216
What was that?

215
00:11:32,349 --> 00:11:33,750
[Laci] Oh, it just...
It makes that noise.

216
00:11:33,884 --> 00:11:34,951
I don't know.

217
00:11:38,221 --> 00:11:39,590
[car alarm chirps]

218
00:11:40,523 --> 00:11:41,492
[Laci] Why is it doing that?

219
00:11:41,625 --> 00:11:43,192
[door thudding]

220
00:11:43,326 --> 00:11:44,494
It just doesn't work at all.

221
00:11:44,628 --> 00:11:46,028
[David laughs]

222
00:11:46,163 --> 00:11:47,630
- [David] That's all right. Let me just...
- I'm sorry.

223
00:11:47,764 --> 00:11:50,167
Oh, you can sit...
Oh, what's that?

224
00:11:50,299 --> 00:11:51,301
[David] Oh.

225
00:11:52,802 --> 00:11:55,239
- It's a surprise for later.
- A surprise?

226
00:11:55,371 --> 00:11:56,171
Yeah.

227
00:11:56,306 --> 00:11:57,541
[car alarm wailing]

228
00:11:57,673 --> 00:11:58,908
Sorry.

229
00:11:59,042 --> 00:12:01,211
I told you, it's just...
It just...

230
00:12:01,344 --> 00:12:03,780
[both laugh]

231
00:12:03,913 --> 00:12:05,048
Sorry.

232
00:12:05,182 --> 00:12:07,750
- It's all right.
- It just, um... Yeah, so.

233
00:12:07,884 --> 00:12:10,052
- A temperamental car.
- It's temperamental.

234
00:12:10,187 --> 00:12:11,754
[reverse alarm beeping]

235
00:12:11,888 --> 00:12:13,822
- All right, then. Ready?
- Yeah.

236
00:12:13,956 --> 00:12:15,192
- Great.
- So, where are we going?

237
00:12:15,325 --> 00:12:18,495
Um, well, I actually have to run
and get an outfit

238
00:12:18,628 --> 00:12:21,831
because I have a thing I have
to go to tonight, so, yeah.

239
00:12:21,965 --> 00:12:23,567
Okay. Right on.

240
00:12:24,268 --> 00:12:25,802
- I'm headed up.
- What?

241
00:12:25,936 --> 00:12:28,839
- It's all right.
- It's the dangerous car.

242
00:12:28,971 --> 00:12:29,972
It is. It's very...

243
00:12:30,106 --> 00:12:32,274
- It'll kill ya.
- It'll kill ya!

244
00:12:32,408 --> 00:12:33,610
You know, watch out!

245
00:12:35,912 --> 00:12:38,815
- Yes, I know. It's hot, right?
- It sure is.

246
00:12:38,947 --> 00:12:40,417
You can turn the air
conditioning on if you'd like.

247
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:41,285
[David] Okay.

248
00:12:41,418 --> 00:12:42,887
Uh...

249
00:12:44,053 --> 00:12:45,389
- How's that?
- Oh, that's perfect.

250
00:12:45,522 --> 00:12:46,289
Thank you.

251
00:12:46,856 --> 00:12:48,591
Yeah, I don't want, you know,

252
00:12:48,725 --> 00:12:50,793
you don't want to get yourself
all sweaty and...

253
00:12:50,927 --> 00:12:51,829
Of course.

254
00:12:51,961 --> 00:12:53,163
- Like I am.
- Seat belt, David.

255
00:12:53,296 --> 00:12:54,230
Oh, right.

256
00:12:55,131 --> 00:12:56,099
- Seat belt.
- Whoa.

257
00:12:57,399 --> 00:12:58,468
Okay.

258
00:13:00,903 --> 00:13:02,472
[Laci] David, is it on yet?

259
00:13:02,605 --> 00:13:04,040
- Is it on, is it on?
- We're on.

260
00:13:04,173 --> 00:13:05,174
[chuckles]

261
00:13:05,307 --> 00:13:06,809
Okay,
so this is the Oklahoma sign.

262
00:13:06,942 --> 00:13:08,312
Um...

263
00:13:08,445 --> 00:13:10,447
Basically I've always wanted
to have my picture taken here

264
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:13,584
because
when I'm a big, famous star, uh,

265
00:13:13,716 --> 00:13:15,718
I don't know, I just think it
would be nice for people to know

266
00:13:15,851 --> 00:13:16,786
where I came from, you know.

267
00:13:16,919 --> 00:13:18,554
Like... I want them to know

268
00:13:18,688 --> 00:13:20,823
that I'm really
just a corn fed girl.

269
00:13:20,956 --> 00:13:21,990
[both laugh]

270
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:24,528
And that you are.
All right, let's go.

271
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:25,762
[Laci] Okay, come on.

272
00:13:29,566 --> 00:13:30,533
It's so hot.

273
00:13:30,668 --> 00:13:31,900
[speaking indistinctly]

274
00:13:32,034 --> 00:13:35,004
[wind blowing]

275
00:13:38,808 --> 00:13:39,742
No.

276
00:13:42,979 --> 00:13:43,847
So...

277
00:13:49,352 --> 00:13:50,620
This is Oklahoma.

278
00:13:53,756 --> 00:13:57,124
[David laughs]

279
00:13:58,293 --> 00:14:00,496
Hometown brand, you know.

280
00:14:02,631 --> 00:14:04,267
You want to stay here
your whole life?

281
00:14:04,868 --> 00:14:05,970
No.

282
00:14:07,403 --> 00:14:10,740
I like to see stuff.
It's kind of loud.

283
00:14:12,609 --> 00:14:14,610
I don't know, I'd like
to see things, you know.

284
00:14:15,644 --> 00:14:16,679
Like what?

285
00:14:18,648 --> 00:14:20,683
- Like Italy.
- All right.

286
00:14:21,751 --> 00:14:22,785
I don't know.

287
00:14:22,918 --> 00:14:25,020
[both laugh]

288
00:14:25,154 --> 00:14:26,589
Look, don't be shy.

289
00:14:26,724 --> 00:14:28,158
I don't know, I just...

290
00:14:28,924 --> 00:14:33,128
I think it'd be nice to, like,
see everything out there,

291
00:14:33,263 --> 00:14:35,966
you know, just something
different from...

292
00:14:36,566 --> 00:14:37,533
Ooh.

293
00:14:38,802 --> 00:14:40,903
- [David] You doing okay?
- Oh, yeah.

294
00:14:41,037 --> 00:14:44,208
I just stepped on this
broken something.

295
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,509
- [David] Well, uh...
- Anyways...

296
00:14:46,643 --> 00:14:49,579
- Thanks for showing me that.
- Of course.

297
00:14:49,712 --> 00:14:50,813
I'm going to turn this off

298
00:14:50,947 --> 00:14:53,450
because we got a big afternoon
ahead of us.

299
00:14:53,582 --> 00:14:54,485
Yes, we do.

300
00:14:55,217 --> 00:14:56,451
- Bye.
- Bye!

301
00:14:56,586 --> 00:14:58,087
Essentially what we're going
to be doing right now

302
00:14:58,221 --> 00:14:59,788
is we're just driving.

303
00:14:59,922 --> 00:15:03,560
Um, there's this really great, uh,
vintage shop that I really like.

304
00:15:03,692 --> 00:15:04,860
- Um...
- Uh-huh.

305
00:15:04,994 --> 00:15:06,296
It's probably one
of my favorites.

306
00:15:06,429 --> 00:15:12,067
So we're just going to drive
there and, uh... Yeah.

307
00:15:12,201 --> 00:15:13,903
- It'd be cool.
- Great.

308
00:15:14,037 --> 00:15:16,038
So I just... I hate...

309
00:15:16,172 --> 00:15:18,207
This street freaks me out
a little bit.

310
00:15:18,341 --> 00:15:19,342
It's right there.

311
00:15:25,115 --> 00:15:29,586
This is it. It's interesting.
Kind of a scary little monkey.

312
00:15:35,125 --> 00:15:36,894
I love antique stores.

313
00:15:38,327 --> 00:15:39,161
[David] Wow!

314
00:15:39,294 --> 00:15:41,597
You know, especially because...

315
00:15:43,365 --> 00:15:46,168
it's just so much history
and everything that's here

316
00:15:46,302 --> 00:15:48,504
as opposed
to something brand new.

317
00:15:52,174 --> 00:15:54,310
- Oh, hi!
- Hi.

318
00:16:01,616 --> 00:16:03,519
[Laci] I think,
this is the children's section.

319
00:16:04,553 --> 00:16:06,622
Oh, look at that!
That's so gorgeous.

320
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:08,759
A little tutu up there.

321
00:16:10,059 --> 00:16:12,427
- Wow.
- This place is amazing.

322
00:16:12,562 --> 00:16:14,130
[Laci] Isn't it, though?

323
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:19,235
[somber music playing]

324
00:16:19,369 --> 00:16:20,537
- [David] Oh.
- Hi.

325
00:16:20,671 --> 00:16:22,739
- [David] I'm just, uh...
- It's all right.

326
00:16:22,873 --> 00:16:25,876
[David] Looking at all the...

327
00:16:27,309 --> 00:16:29,812
all the interesting stuff.

328
00:16:33,416 --> 00:16:35,185
Yeah, it is really interesting.

329
00:16:44,927 --> 00:16:46,196
[David sighs]

330
00:16:57,807 --> 00:16:59,143
Isn't it wonderful?

331
00:17:03,779 --> 00:17:05,214
I know, Isn't it wonderful?

332
00:17:06,516 --> 00:17:07,918
Oh, she's scary.

333
00:17:11,086 --> 00:17:11,721
[jarring indication]

334
00:17:11,855 --> 00:17:13,355
- David.
- Yeah.

335
00:17:13,489 --> 00:17:15,357
Why are you so interested
in all these mannequins?

336
00:17:15,491 --> 00:17:18,260
Oh, I'm just looking at the...
the design of them.

337
00:17:18,394 --> 00:17:21,198
I mean,
they're so intricate and old.

338
00:17:21,330 --> 00:17:22,397
I mean...

339
00:17:22,531 --> 00:17:23,532
[jarring indication]

340
00:17:23,666 --> 00:17:25,034
- Sure.
- There you are.

341
00:17:31,473 --> 00:17:32,575
[Laci] I love the clothes.

342
00:17:32,709 --> 00:17:33,477
[jarring indication]

343
00:17:42,051 --> 00:17:43,219
[jarring indication]

344
00:17:51,928 --> 00:17:53,897
- [David] What's that?
- A shirt.

345
00:17:55,097 --> 00:17:57,066
- What does that say?
- Rockstar.

346
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,236
- Rockstar.
- I'm going to a concert tonight.

347
00:17:59,368 --> 00:18:00,936
It seems appropriate.

348
00:18:01,069 --> 00:18:02,471
- [David] You are?
- Yeah.

349
00:18:02,605 --> 00:18:04,807
It's outside, so, it's going
to be kind of hot I'm guessing.

350
00:18:04,941 --> 00:18:06,943
I probably should get some
shorts while I'm here.

351
00:18:07,777 --> 00:18:09,278
Oh, [inaudible].

352
00:18:13,583 --> 00:18:14,817
They're cute.

353
00:18:15,251 --> 00:18:16,286
[jarring indication]

354
00:18:16,986 --> 00:18:18,188
Oh, these are better.

355
00:18:19,321 --> 00:18:20,323
Look at these.

356
00:18:21,257 --> 00:18:23,360
- Look at that.
- Yeah.

357
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:29,967
[somber music playing]

358
00:18:32,134 --> 00:18:33,804
- Hey, David!
- Yeah.

359
00:18:33,936 --> 00:18:35,304
- [Laci] You okay?
- I'm fine.

360
00:18:35,438 --> 00:18:36,539
[Laci] You're awfully quiet.

361
00:18:36,672 --> 00:18:38,240
[David] I just find
this very interesting.

362
00:18:38,374 --> 00:18:39,709
[Laci] Well, that's good.

363
00:18:39,843 --> 00:18:42,077
I'm going to try these on.
I'll be out in a minute, okay?

364
00:18:42,211 --> 00:18:43,180
[David] Okay.

365
00:19:28,057 --> 00:19:30,257
You gonna come out
and show me your new outfit?

366
00:19:30,259 --> 00:19:31,894
- [Laci] I'll be out in a minute.
- Okay.

367
00:19:41,636 --> 00:19:42,371
[Laci] See.

368
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:45,173
- Wow.
- I like it.

369
00:19:45,307 --> 00:19:47,277
Yeah, let me see you,
let me see you.

370
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:50,380
Come on out here. Wow!

371
00:19:50,512 --> 00:19:52,882
I like it. It's cute.

372
00:19:54,983 --> 00:19:56,052
Looks great.

373
00:19:57,386 --> 00:20:00,123
- Don't hurt yourself.
- I won't.

374
00:20:08,263 --> 00:20:10,766
- You should see yourself.
- God, I look fat.

375
00:20:11,701 --> 00:20:14,738
- [David] What'd you say?
- Nothing. I'm just being silly.

376
00:20:17,307 --> 00:20:18,674
Well, I thought I said you...

377
00:20:18,807 --> 00:20:21,077
I thought I heard you say you
were fat or something like that.

378
00:20:21,211 --> 00:20:22,378
[Laci] No.

379
00:20:26,249 --> 00:20:30,019
I love this dress. Look at this.

380
00:20:30,153 --> 00:20:31,788
Round up.
[chuckles]

381
00:20:45,101 --> 00:20:46,136
[David sighs]

382
00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:50,307
[Laci]
Um, this dress is wonderful.

383
00:20:51,539 --> 00:20:52,975
Oh, my gosh!

384
00:20:53,943 --> 00:20:55,144
Look at this.

385
00:20:57,346 --> 00:20:58,114
[David] Oh!

386
00:20:59,715 --> 00:21:03,151
All right, David. I'm going to
change back into my clothes, so...

387
00:21:03,286 --> 00:21:05,288
- Okay. Yeah.
- You okay?

388
00:21:05,422 --> 00:21:08,158
I'll be, uh, waiting out here.

389
00:21:10,093 --> 00:21:15,331
So, uh, what's this, um,
thing you're going to tonight?

390
00:21:15,964 --> 00:21:17,533
[Laci] Oh, it's a concert.

391
00:21:19,903 --> 00:21:21,770
Uh, who is it?

392
00:21:21,904 --> 00:21:23,239
[Laci]
Oh, I don't know actually.

393
00:21:23,373 --> 00:21:26,876
I was just invited, so, I didn't
buy the tickets or anything.

394
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:29,077
[David] Huh.

395
00:21:29,778 --> 00:21:31,881
- Who are you going with?
- A really nice boy.

396
00:21:32,013 --> 00:21:33,048
His name's Andy.

397
00:21:34,984 --> 00:21:36,919
- [David] Andy.
- Boy, he's not a boy, he's 26.

398
00:21:37,053 --> 00:21:40,656
He's a man. Or is he 25?
I don't really remember.

399
00:21:40,789 --> 00:21:42,325
[David] He's much older
than you, isn't he?

400
00:21:42,459 --> 00:21:44,294
[Laci] Not that much older,
six years.

401
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:46,729
My mom and daddy
are ten years apart.

402
00:21:46,862 --> 00:21:50,100
Does that mean
that you're into older men?

403
00:21:51,401 --> 00:21:53,068
It's not like,
I'm into older men.

404
00:21:53,202 --> 00:21:56,806
I'm just, you know,
not age discriminatory.

405
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:58,007
[David laughs]

406
00:21:58,141 --> 00:22:00,110
Well, I guess,
that's good to know.

407
00:22:17,759 --> 00:22:20,864
[David] Uh, Ashley.

408
00:22:22,397 --> 00:22:23,365
Hi.

409
00:22:24,099 --> 00:22:25,567
- What are you doing here?
- [Josh] This... this is the camera guy.

410
00:22:25,701 --> 00:22:27,870
[inaudible]. She said that
you've been at her job and stuff.

411
00:22:28,003 --> 00:22:29,504
I'm her boyfriend, Josh.

412
00:22:29,638 --> 00:22:31,740
Who are you
and what is up with the camera?

413
00:22:31,874 --> 00:22:34,576
- I am David and I'm a director.
- Well, David the director,

414
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:36,779
she said that
she is not doing a movie.

415
00:22:36,913 --> 00:22:38,347
She said she already
told you take the...

416
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,682
You're going to know
who I am when I take the camera

417
00:22:40,817 --> 00:22:41,617
and bust you across
the head with...

418
00:22:43,952 --> 00:22:46,254
[David]
Excuse me, excuse me.

419
00:22:46,388 --> 00:22:47,990
- Josh, that was your name?
- Come on.

420
00:22:48,124 --> 00:22:52,127
Hey, listen. Listen, I'm really,
really, sorry about that, okay?

421
00:22:52,261 --> 00:22:54,129
I... That...
I didn't mean to do that.

422
00:22:54,262 --> 00:22:55,999
- What? What?
- Actually, I apologize.

423
00:22:56,132 --> 00:22:58,301
David, can we just
talk about this later?

424
00:22:58,433 --> 00:23:00,302
I'll talk about it
with him tonight

425
00:23:00,436 --> 00:23:02,071
and then I'll talk
about it with you later.

426
00:23:02,204 --> 00:23:03,471
- [Josh] All right, there, there, there.
- [David] I appreciate that.

427
00:23:03,605 --> 00:23:05,307
See there's even fireworks
in the background.

428
00:23:05,441 --> 00:23:06,808
- It was meant to be.
- [Josh] Yeah.

429
00:23:06,942 --> 00:23:08,744
[David]
Josh, listen, I'm a director.

430
00:23:08,877 --> 00:23:10,547
I've worked so hard on this film
and she's my best girl.

431
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:11,814
I understand. I understand.

432
00:23:11,948 --> 00:23:13,650
And she's...
she's serious about this

433
00:23:13,782 --> 00:23:16,017
but... but you're following
her around, it's weird.

434
00:23:16,152 --> 00:23:17,886
I'm not... I don't know.
I'm not in it.

435
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:19,489
I'm not an actor like her.

436
00:23:19,622 --> 00:23:22,024
I don't know this stuff, but it's...
it's weird to me, okay?

437
00:23:22,157 --> 00:23:23,492
We'll talk about this later,
okay? How about that?

438
00:23:23,625 --> 00:23:25,528
Yeah, we'll talk...
we'll talk about it later.

439
00:23:25,662 --> 00:23:28,298
[David] I appreciate it.
Thank you, Ashley.

440
00:23:28,431 --> 00:23:31,433
[fireworks]

441
00:23:32,568 --> 00:23:33,702
[David] It's all meant to be.

442
00:23:33,836 --> 00:23:37,806
[somber music playing]

443
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,709
[David]
So, where are you taking us now?

444
00:23:39,842 --> 00:23:43,879
Um, well, actually, I have
a couple of things I have to do

445
00:23:44,012 --> 00:23:48,350
but I was thinking maybe I might
show you my old high school

446
00:23:48,484 --> 00:23:50,919
only because I haven't been
there in a while and, you know,

447
00:23:51,054 --> 00:23:52,155
you said
you wanted to get to know me.

448
00:23:52,288 --> 00:23:54,790
So, I figured
maybe you might enjoy seeing it.

449
00:23:54,923 --> 00:23:57,259
- Well, that sounds like fun.
- Ah, here it is.

450
00:23:58,228 --> 00:24:00,129
I like it. It's a good school.

451
00:24:01,297 --> 00:24:06,201
If you... Actually if you look at it...
Uh, I hate this seat belt.

452
00:24:06,335 --> 00:24:07,670
Oh, there we go. Okay.

453
00:24:07,804 --> 00:24:13,942
This is the high school
and there's the football field.

454
00:24:14,076 --> 00:24:15,478
Go team!

455
00:24:16,778 --> 00:24:19,782
High school is definitely
an interesting little, uh...

456
00:24:19,915 --> 00:24:22,152
- Did you like high school?
- Parts of it.

457
00:24:23,486 --> 00:24:24,653
[David chuckles]

458
00:24:25,255 --> 00:24:26,489
Did you ever ditch?

459
00:24:26,855 --> 00:24:29,325
Huh, no. I was a good girl.

460
00:24:30,026 --> 00:24:31,361
I don't call it ditching. I...

461
00:24:31,928 --> 00:24:38,134
I call it, uh, deciding
to not attend for the day.

462
00:24:38,268 --> 00:24:39,701
[David laughs]

463
00:24:40,836 --> 00:24:42,904
I think, I did that quite a bit
when I was younger too.

464
00:24:43,038 --> 00:24:45,740
Only in my senior year. I never
really missed other than that.

465
00:24:45,875 --> 00:24:47,777
I liked school. It was, uh...

466
00:24:48,943 --> 00:24:50,980
So did you have
a best friend in school?

467
00:24:51,114 --> 00:24:53,516
- A girl you palled out with?
- Oh, yeah.

468
00:24:53,650 --> 00:24:56,085
Her name is
Julia Anderson actually.

469
00:24:57,086 --> 00:25:00,323
- She's not my friend anymore.
- How come?

470
00:25:00,455 --> 00:25:01,690
It's a long story.

471
00:25:04,727 --> 00:25:06,696
- Here we are.
- Okay.

472
00:25:15,805 --> 00:25:16,806
This is...

473
00:25:20,209 --> 00:25:21,878
Durant High School.

474
00:25:23,711 --> 00:25:26,981
Spent four years of my life here

475
00:25:27,115 --> 00:25:32,454
and I must say it was
very interesting four years.

476
00:25:33,288 --> 00:25:35,124
[David] And why is that?

477
00:25:35,257 --> 00:25:36,659
Just, um...

478
00:25:37,559 --> 00:25:39,595
you know, you have friends
you've had forever

479
00:25:39,729 --> 00:25:42,264
and some friends get pregnant,
and some friends don't.

480
00:25:42,397 --> 00:25:43,965
Some friends go to college

481
00:25:44,098 --> 00:25:45,867
and the friends you thought
would go to college get pregnant,

482
00:25:46,001 --> 00:25:48,637
and then the friends you think who are
going to end up ruining their lives

483
00:25:48,770 --> 00:25:50,572
actually go to Harvard, so.

484
00:25:50,705 --> 00:25:53,009
Well, no one went to Harvard,
but you know what I mean.

485
00:25:53,142 --> 00:25:57,078
So, did you date
one of your football players?

486
00:25:57,212 --> 00:25:59,514
- Of course, I did.
- What was his name?

487
00:25:59,647 --> 00:26:02,584
His name is Skip
and that's not a joke either.

488
00:26:02,719 --> 00:26:03,620
[David] Skip.

489
00:26:04,554 --> 00:26:05,621
Bleachers.

490
00:26:05,755 --> 00:26:07,390
[Laci] Yeah, bleachers.

491
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:12,095
[David] There must be
a story about that.

492
00:26:12,929 --> 00:26:15,163
- Lots of stories about that.
- Oh, really?

493
00:26:15,298 --> 00:26:16,231
[Laci] Mm-hmm.

494
00:26:16,365 --> 00:26:17,231
Like what?

495
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,836
Nothing much.
Just, you know, standard, uh...

496
00:26:22,471 --> 00:26:26,908
games that are won
and, you know,

497
00:26:27,041 --> 00:26:29,345
getting drunk, things like that.

498
00:26:29,478 --> 00:26:32,615
Sneaking out of the house at 14
stealing your parents car.

499
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:35,084
Stupid stuff really.

500
00:26:35,218 --> 00:26:37,720
[David] I thought you said,
you were a good girl.

501
00:26:37,853 --> 00:26:40,590
Good girls are bad girls
who don't get caught, David.

502
00:26:41,423 --> 00:26:42,925
So, this is a football field.

503
00:26:43,058 --> 00:26:44,192
[Laci] Yeah,
this is the football field.

504
00:26:44,326 --> 00:26:46,596
[David] I bet you've seen
many a game here.

505
00:26:46,729 --> 00:26:48,864
[Laci] I have. I was a
cheerleader, so, I saw every game.

506
00:26:48,998 --> 00:26:51,167
- No! You were a cheerleader?
- I was a cheerleader.

507
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:52,367
Really?

508
00:26:53,102 --> 00:26:54,671
Yeah. Sadly.

509
00:26:55,637 --> 00:26:56,905
And, uh...

510
00:26:58,441 --> 00:26:59,708
would you feel
like doing a cheer for me?

511
00:26:59,842 --> 00:27:01,576
- No, no.
- Oh, come on.

512
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:03,211
- No.
- Why not?

513
00:27:03,345 --> 00:27:05,815
[Laci]
Because I can't cheer anymore.

514
00:27:05,948 --> 00:27:09,252
- I bet you can.
- No, I can't.

515
00:27:09,384 --> 00:27:12,087
I don't do that anymore, David.

516
00:27:12,888 --> 00:27:17,659
I haven't done a cheer
since I was about 17 years old.

517
00:27:18,693 --> 00:27:19,928
So, you never forget it.

518
00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:22,765
That's not true.

519
00:27:22,898 --> 00:27:24,433
You can forget everything.

520
00:27:25,268 --> 00:27:28,738
I bet you,
you can do a cheer right now.

521
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:32,607
I don't know.

522
00:27:33,509 --> 00:27:36,045
Lot of...
It's a lot of energy, David.

523
00:27:37,445 --> 00:27:38,714
Ah, I'll kill myself.

524
00:27:39,682 --> 00:27:40,950
[David] No, we don't want that.

525
00:27:42,184 --> 00:27:43,286
- [Laci] No.
- So, how does it go?

526
00:27:43,419 --> 00:27:45,188
Just tell me the lines then.

527
00:27:46,221 --> 00:27:48,557
- Come on.
- All right, hold these.

528
00:27:56,766 --> 00:27:58,168
[David laughs]

529
00:27:59,367 --> 00:28:02,704
A-T-T-A-C-K, the lions are back!

530
00:28:02,837 --> 00:28:06,174
A-T-T-A-C-K,
we're leading the pack.

531
00:28:06,307 --> 00:28:09,744
A-T-T-A-C-K,
attack, attack, attack!

532
00:28:09,878 --> 00:28:11,046
[David laughs]

533
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:12,147
That was great.

534
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,782
Oh,
look at that I broke my watch.

535
00:28:13,915 --> 00:28:16,719
- [David] Oh, no!
- My sister gave that to me.

536
00:28:16,852 --> 00:28:18,387
Can you help me
find the other piece, please?

537
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:20,589
- Sure.
- This is terribly important.

538
00:28:20,722 --> 00:28:22,357
You don't understand.
She's passed away

539
00:28:22,490 --> 00:28:24,493
and this is like the only thing
I have left of her.

540
00:28:25,394 --> 00:28:26,229
[David] Oh, no.

541
00:28:27,395 --> 00:28:28,798
You were really close?

542
00:28:28,932 --> 00:28:29,999
She was my best friend,

543
00:28:30,132 --> 00:28:31,133
but I don't want to talk
about it right now.

544
00:28:31,267 --> 00:28:32,268
I just want to find it.

545
00:28:33,102 --> 00:28:35,238
Look, this is
really, really, important.

546
00:28:36,939 --> 00:28:38,774
[both sigh]

547
00:28:39,708 --> 00:28:41,311
[David] What part broke of it?
Let me see.

548
00:28:42,478 --> 00:28:44,547
- Oh, the strap came off.
- Oh, just kidding.

549
00:28:45,548 --> 00:28:47,348
This is how blonde I am.

550
00:28:47,482 --> 00:28:48,550
[Laci laughs]

551
00:28:48,683 --> 00:28:52,387
I can't... It's fine.
I'll fix it later.

552
00:28:52,521 --> 00:28:55,290
- [David] I can fix it for you.
- Are you sure?

553
00:28:55,423 --> 00:28:57,058
- [David] Yeah.
- Thank you.

554
00:28:57,192 --> 00:29:00,429
[David] I'll just, uh... I'll do it
at the end of the interview, okay?

555
00:29:00,563 --> 00:29:01,865
[Laci] Okay great, thanks.

556
00:29:03,532 --> 00:29:04,833
- Don't lose it.
- I won't.

557
00:29:05,534 --> 00:29:08,605
[somber music playing]

558
00:29:11,073 --> 00:29:12,976
[knocking on door]

559
00:29:17,747 --> 00:29:18,848
- Hi, Mr. Ashland.
- You made it.

560
00:29:19,615 --> 00:29:22,018
- David remember, call me David.
- Oh, that's right, David.

561
00:29:22,151 --> 00:29:23,451
I'm sorry.

562
00:29:23,586 --> 00:29:26,154
Wow, you certainly are a dancer
and you brought the red shoes.

563
00:29:26,288 --> 00:29:28,923
- Yeah, I got the red shoes.
- Well, come on in.

564
00:29:29,057 --> 00:29:32,961
Um, actually, uh,
so where are the other girls?

565
00:29:33,095 --> 00:29:35,765
Oh, you know, you're the first one here.
You're right on time

566
00:29:35,897 --> 00:29:37,966
and the other girls
are on their way actually.

567
00:29:38,099 --> 00:29:39,334
Okay.

568
00:29:39,468 --> 00:29:42,638
Well, um, you know, as...
I can wait in the lobby.

569
00:29:42,771 --> 00:29:44,572
There's...
there's no problem actually.

570
00:29:44,707 --> 00:29:46,976
Well, no.
Certainly you can come in.

571
00:29:47,109 --> 00:29:49,243
I mean one of them called
and said they were getting gas.

572
00:29:49,377 --> 00:29:50,678
They're running a little late

573
00:29:50,813 --> 00:29:53,115
and the other is actually
parking their car right now.

574
00:29:53,248 --> 00:29:54,383
So, you're just first.

575
00:29:54,516 --> 00:29:55,651
Um...

576
00:29:56,551 --> 00:29:58,620
- Okay.
- All right, come on in.

577
00:29:59,721 --> 00:30:01,723
- You certainly look great.
- Thanks.

578
00:30:01,857 --> 00:30:03,091
[door closes]

579
00:30:08,131 --> 00:30:11,066
- [David] I'm filming you all real.
- [Megan] No, no, no.

580
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,201
[David] You're all real.

581
00:30:13,335 --> 00:30:15,304
Well, this is what
we're doing together.

582
00:30:15,438 --> 00:30:20,710
- [Megan] No, why would you do this. No!
- You're doing this.

583
00:30:21,309 --> 00:30:24,279
- You're doing it.
- No, no, you're doing this.

584
00:30:24,413 --> 00:30:27,916
Why are you doing this?
Why are you doing this?

585
00:30:28,049 --> 00:30:29,451
- No.
- [Megan crying]

586
00:30:30,519 --> 00:30:31,287
[David] Oh.

587
00:30:33,755 --> 00:30:34,590
That's real.

588
00:30:40,696 --> 00:30:42,197
- Hello.
- Hello.

589
00:30:42,897 --> 00:30:44,666
- How are you?
- I'm great.

590
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:46,234
I've never been better actually.

591
00:30:46,367 --> 00:30:47,769
Good.

592
00:30:47,903 --> 00:30:49,505
[reverse alarm beeping]

593
00:30:49,637 --> 00:30:51,907
So, David, you know
all this stuff about me.

594
00:30:52,575 --> 00:30:53,609
What about you?

595
00:30:54,509 --> 00:30:55,944
Where'd you go to high school?

596
00:30:57,546 --> 00:31:03,552
Well, I traveled a lot
as a, uh, kid and a teenager.

597
00:31:03,685 --> 00:31:06,721
You see my, uh,
my father was a pilot.

598
00:31:06,855 --> 00:31:09,724
That's cool.
What kind of planes did he fly?

599
00:31:09,858 --> 00:31:14,297
- He, uh, designed and built his own.
- Really?

600
00:31:14,430 --> 00:31:15,999
Yeah, small planes and...

601
00:31:18,067 --> 00:31:22,238
we'd fly from little airport
to little airport having lunches

602
00:31:22,371 --> 00:31:26,275
and I mean
I wanted to be a pilot myself

603
00:31:26,407 --> 00:31:28,609
- but I just, uh...
- What happened?

604
00:31:29,411 --> 00:31:35,584
I, um... I don't have as you can
see I have to wear these glasses.

605
00:31:35,718 --> 00:31:38,988
- Oh, right.
- So, my eyesight isn't that great

606
00:31:39,121 --> 00:31:43,426
and, um, I just have trouble
seeing things far away and...

607
00:31:45,259 --> 00:31:47,596
Actually one time I me
and my dad were flying and...

608
00:31:49,065 --> 00:31:50,333
he asked me to look around
for planes.

609
00:31:50,465 --> 00:31:51,432
And I looked and I looked

610
00:31:51,567 --> 00:31:54,269
and I thought
I had seen something

611
00:31:54,403 --> 00:31:55,971
that was right under us,

612
00:31:56,105 --> 00:31:57,839
and I told him
and he didn't believe me.

613
00:31:57,972 --> 00:31:59,741
He thought
I was kidding and, uh...

614
00:32:00,910 --> 00:32:03,278
And it was just a near miss
in the air

615
00:32:03,412 --> 00:32:06,781
not less than 200 feet,
a plane flew right under us.

616
00:32:06,915 --> 00:32:10,384
- Oh, my!
- And so it was kind of scary.

617
00:32:10,519 --> 00:32:11,720
And so, at any rate
that scared me

618
00:32:11,854 --> 00:32:14,556
and I just don't like
to fly anymore.

619
00:32:14,690 --> 00:32:16,125
Oh, well, that makes sense

620
00:32:16,258 --> 00:32:18,894
and do you... Are you still
close with your father?

621
00:32:21,896 --> 00:32:22,664
No.

622
00:32:23,731 --> 00:32:24,767
I'm sorry.

623
00:32:27,236 --> 00:32:28,471
So, this is the park.

624
00:32:31,707 --> 00:32:33,709
I used to play here
all the time.

625
00:32:33,842 --> 00:32:34,977
- Oh, yeah?
- Oh, yeah.

626
00:32:35,109 --> 00:32:36,477
What was your favorite game?

627
00:32:36,612 --> 00:32:39,715
Mm, I liked the swings but...

628
00:32:40,348 --> 00:32:44,285
Um, I also liked to draw
with chalk and, you know,

629
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:47,523
slides, really everything.
Oh, my God!

630
00:32:48,391 --> 00:32:51,027
- Look at that.
- What's that?

631
00:32:51,727 --> 00:32:53,062
[David laughs]

632
00:32:53,194 --> 00:32:56,898
[Laci] Becca, ones only. Sarah.

633
00:32:57,599 --> 00:32:59,033
Look at that.

634
00:32:59,166 --> 00:33:01,303
I used to do stuff like this
all the time.

635
00:33:03,439 --> 00:33:06,242
Except mine would be Laci Lee.

636
00:33:09,311 --> 00:33:12,447
Oh, my God! This is one
of my favorite things, David.

637
00:33:13,147 --> 00:33:14,182
Look over here.

638
00:33:15,317 --> 00:33:16,184
This...

639
00:33:19,922 --> 00:33:22,089
this was my first boyfriend.

640
00:33:22,223 --> 00:33:22,990
[David laughs]

641
00:33:23,125 --> 00:33:24,192
[Laci] Just kidding.

642
00:33:24,326 --> 00:33:26,662
- Um, this was...
- I see.

643
00:33:28,896 --> 00:33:32,768
This was just, uh...
It was the tire swing.

644
00:33:32,901 --> 00:33:35,737
I didn't practically hit my head
on the ceiling when I used to.

645
00:33:35,871 --> 00:33:38,774
It was like the tire swing, you know.
It's something every kid just loved.

646
00:33:38,907 --> 00:33:41,543
It... it was the rocket ship.

647
00:33:42,577 --> 00:33:44,113
With a pole around the center.

648
00:33:45,713 --> 00:33:46,682
You know...

649
00:33:48,482 --> 00:33:49,417
it's fun.

650
00:33:50,219 --> 00:33:53,823
It was, um... was good.

651

655
00:34:19,146 --> 00:34:21,516
- Don't look up my dress now, David.
- Oh, now!

656
00:34:21,650 --> 00:34:22,918
What kind of man
do you think I am?

657
00:34:23,050 --> 00:34:25,386
[Laci]
No, you're a man at the most.

658
00:34:25,521 --> 00:34:27,489
[David laughs]

659
00:34:27,956 --> 00:34:30,092
- [David] Where are you going?
- Down the slide.

660
00:34:35,563 --> 00:34:36,464
Ah!

661
00:34:37,432 --> 00:34:38,400
[David] Whoa!

662
00:34:38,532 --> 00:34:41,036
[both laugh]

663
00:34:41,170 --> 00:34:42,171
Are you okay?

664
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:45,141
[Laci laughing]

665
00:34:47,742 --> 00:34:49,009
[Laci] I'm fine.

666
00:34:49,911 --> 00:34:50,679
I forgot,
how fast those things can be.

667
00:34:50,811 --> 00:34:52,080
[David] Oh, man, that was...

668
00:34:54,115 --> 00:34:55,251
- Wow!
- You sure you're okay?

669
00:34:55,384 --> 00:34:56,552
I'm fine.

670
00:34:57,619 --> 00:34:59,422
[continues laughing]

671
00:35:01,155 --> 00:35:02,757
You are just something else,
you know that.

672
00:35:02,891 --> 00:35:05,226
When we're done
you'll be cutting that.

673
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:07,262
[laughs]

674
00:35:08,764 --> 00:35:09,965
You know that was...

675
00:35:10,097 --> 00:35:12,201
I guess that was as real
as they get, you know.

676
00:35:12,333 --> 00:35:13,702
That is as real as they get.

677
00:35:15,103 --> 00:35:18,039
Oh, look. That was me.

678
00:35:19,141 --> 00:35:20,710
[David]
You used to swing on here?

679
00:35:26,715 --> 00:35:28,284
Hey, can I swing with you?

680
00:35:29,885 --> 00:35:30,720
Thank you.

681
00:35:31,519 --> 00:35:32,688
That's my friend David.

682
00:35:33,588 --> 00:35:36,491
- [David] Hi, what's your name?
- Sarah.

683
00:35:36,625 --> 00:35:37,460
Hi, Sarah.

684
00:35:38,427 --> 00:35:41,230
- You live around here?
- I live over there.

685
00:35:42,731 --> 00:35:43,798
[Laci] The brick house?

686
00:35:44,498 --> 00:35:46,033
It's beautiful.

687
00:35:46,168 --> 00:35:48,237
- How old are you, Sarah?
- [Sarah] 11.

688
00:35:48,369 --> 00:35:49,438
[Laci] 11.

689
00:35:49,570 --> 00:35:51,373
Oh, so that means
you're in sixth grade.

690
00:35:51,507 --> 00:35:53,075
- Yeah.
- Wow!

691
00:35:53,208 --> 00:35:55,710
[swings squeaking]

692
00:35:55,844 --> 00:35:57,346
Who can swing the highest?

693
00:35:57,478 --> 00:35:58,647
I bet I can.

694
00:35:59,648 --> 00:36:00,816
Let's see.

695
00:36:05,086 --> 00:36:07,623
[swings continue squeaking]

696
00:36:19,802 --> 00:36:22,570
[David]
Who's winning, who's winning?

697
00:36:29,711 --> 00:36:31,047
[Laci giggles]

698
00:36:36,619 --> 00:36:39,521
Well, Sarah, I definitely think,
that you won this one.

699
00:36:46,094 --> 00:36:47,429
[David] Now, be careful now.

700
00:36:49,231 --> 00:36:50,365
You can't film here.

701
00:36:51,065 --> 00:36:52,500
So did you used to come here
every day?

702
00:36:52,634 --> 00:36:54,436
Every day.

703
00:36:56,036 --> 00:36:59,007
Well, it's Durant what else
are you going to do?

704
00:36:59,141 --> 00:37:00,142
Right?

705
00:37:04,713 --> 00:37:05,781
[David] That looks like fun.

706
00:37:07,815 --> 00:37:08,650
Stopping.

707
00:37:15,356 --> 00:37:17,425
Sarah, thank you so much
for letting me swing with you.

708
00:37:17,559 --> 00:37:18,827
Your welcome.

709
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:19,928
[Laci]
It was lovely meeting you.

710
00:37:20,896 --> 00:37:21,997
Bye, Sarah.

711
00:37:22,130 --> 00:37:23,065
[David] Bye, Sarah.

712
00:37:28,304 --> 00:37:29,305
[Laci] David.

713
00:37:34,842 --> 00:37:35,944
[David] I'm right here, missy.

714
00:37:37,878 --> 00:37:38,846
I am right here.

715
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:42,451
[somber music playing]

716
00:37:42,585 --> 00:37:45,721
[Amy breathing heavily]

717
00:37:54,362 --> 00:37:56,698
[Amy screams]

718
00:38:04,606 --> 00:38:06,641
What are you...
what are you doing?

719
00:38:06,775 --> 00:38:08,711
What are you doing?

720
00:38:10,644 --> 00:38:11,679
[David] Oh, God!

721
00:38:12,547 --> 00:38:13,782
You are...

722
00:38:15,016 --> 00:38:16,050
perfect.

723
00:38:16,184 --> 00:38:18,254
[whimpering]

724
00:38:29,764 --> 00:38:32,032
[David] Did you and your
boyfriend used to hang out here?

725
00:38:32,166 --> 00:38:33,369
No, no.

726
00:38:34,302 --> 00:38:36,103
Skip, was that his name?

727
00:38:36,237 --> 00:38:39,040
Skip, yeah. That was Skip.

728
00:38:40,275 --> 00:38:42,177
We did more of the, uh...

729
00:38:42,311 --> 00:38:44,980
We started dating high school
freshman year

730
00:38:45,112 --> 00:38:47,047
and then we dated
until senior year,

731
00:38:47,181 --> 00:38:50,151
but, um, essentially
what happened was,

732
00:38:50,286 --> 00:38:54,123
is, uh, we would do more things
like we go to parties together

733
00:38:54,255 --> 00:38:57,324
and, you know, we'd hang out
after the football game and...

734
00:38:57,992 --> 00:39:01,496
I mean we never really did
anything playful

735
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:02,631
or fun like this.

736
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:05,334
He was a real serious guy.

737
00:39:05,467 --> 00:39:08,737
You know, he... he was always
trying to be the best.

738
00:39:09,670 --> 00:39:10,572
Hmm...

739
00:39:12,106 --> 00:39:13,141
Did that bother you?

740
00:39:14,275 --> 00:39:15,310
It's not my life.

741
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:22,550
I sense that maybe you...
you might miss him a little bit?

742
00:39:22,684 --> 00:39:24,219
No, no.

743
00:39:24,353 --> 00:39:28,190
I don't miss him.
I don't miss him at all.

744
00:39:29,458 --> 00:39:32,161
Hmm. Was it a bad breakup?

745
00:39:34,061 --> 00:39:36,030
I don't want to talk
about this with you, David.

746
00:39:36,164 --> 00:39:38,834
I don't mean to be rude or
anything, but it's very personal.

747
00:39:40,369 --> 00:39:41,269
I'm sorry.

748
00:39:43,304 --> 00:39:44,205
It's fine.

749
00:39:49,978 --> 00:39:52,181
I really don't mean to be rude.
It's just...

750
00:39:52,313 --> 00:39:53,882
It's okay. It's okay.

751
00:39:55,217 --> 00:39:56,318
You know, I just...

752
00:39:58,353 --> 00:40:01,155
I'm just trying to find the
realism in everything, you know.

753
00:40:01,289 --> 00:40:04,460
- Of course.
- It's... it's... it's important to me

754
00:40:04,592 --> 00:40:06,293
that each one
of my actors are real

755
00:40:06,427 --> 00:40:09,764
and... and...
but I'll tell you again.

756
00:40:11,099 --> 00:40:12,867
- Hey!
- What?

757
00:40:13,001 --> 00:40:15,304
- You're doing a great job.
- Thanks.

758
00:40:17,773 --> 00:40:18,841
I lied to you.

759
00:40:19,974 --> 00:40:21,410
- You did?
- Mm-hmm.

760
00:40:22,342 --> 00:40:23,844
About what?

761
00:40:23,978 --> 00:40:27,481
I said, I didn't hang out here
with Skip but I did.

762
00:40:27,615 --> 00:40:29,050
I hung out here
with him quite a bit.

763
00:40:33,188 --> 00:40:34,989
We pretended we were married.

764
00:40:35,123 --> 00:40:36,891
[jarring indication]

765
00:40:37,626 --> 00:40:38,561
Silly, right?

766
00:40:40,094 --> 00:40:41,963
Well, not silly.

767
00:40:46,867 --> 00:40:48,603
- H.
- Harris.

768
00:40:49,838 --> 00:40:51,640
Laci Lee Harris.

769
00:40:52,541 --> 00:40:55,043
- And...
- Skip Harris.

770
00:40:55,177 --> 00:40:57,112
[David scoffs]

771
00:40:58,679 --> 00:40:59,748
[scoffs]

772
00:41:00,081 --> 00:41:03,117
I guess you pretty much
didn't make it real, didn't you?

773
00:41:04,518 --> 00:41:05,721
We made it real.

774
00:41:05,853 --> 00:41:09,423
I mean it was, uh...
it was first love, you know.

775
00:41:09,557 --> 00:41:10,693
You know how that works.

776
00:41:11,793 --> 00:41:12,827
You think,
you're going to get married

777
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,294
and you're going
to be together forever,

778
00:41:14,429 --> 00:41:16,798
and you're going to have babies,
and life's going to be perfect,

779
00:41:16,931 --> 00:41:19,702
and...
it doesn't work out that way.

780
00:41:19,835 --> 00:41:21,235
I mean it does for some,
but then, you know,

781
00:41:21,369 --> 00:41:22,371
ten years down the road,

782
00:41:22,503 --> 00:41:24,139
he's fat
and you're living in a trailer.

783
00:41:24,271 --> 00:41:25,507
[David chuckles]

784
00:41:27,009 --> 00:41:28,844
Humor is my defense mechanism.

785
00:41:35,284 --> 00:41:39,488
[David] You know, why didn't you,
uh, carve your name on this tree?

786
00:41:40,422 --> 00:41:41,722
[Laci] Um, that's new I guess.

787
00:41:41,856 --> 00:41:43,659
I mean the tree's not new,
but the...

788
00:41:44,693 --> 00:41:47,362
the, uh,
bark missing from it is...

789
00:41:48,329 --> 00:41:51,300
and I don't like destroying
things of nature.

790
00:41:53,034 --> 00:41:56,605
- What? How sweet of you!
- Hmm, yeah, well.

791
00:41:58,206 --> 00:41:59,240
So...

792
00:42:01,009 --> 00:42:03,378
I take it you and Skip...

793
00:42:06,313 --> 00:42:07,649
did he get you in trouble?

794
00:42:09,050 --> 00:42:09,985
How do you mean?

795
00:42:12,219 --> 00:42:13,254
You know, like, uh...

796
00:42:16,324 --> 00:42:17,459
was he your first?

797
00:42:21,996 --> 00:42:24,365
It's kind of a personal
question, don't you think?

798
00:42:25,032 --> 00:42:28,069
Well, a simple yes
or no would do, don't you think?

799
00:42:31,472 --> 00:42:32,641
Yeah, he was.

800
00:42:34,375 --> 00:42:35,309
[David] Hmm.

801
00:42:38,146 --> 00:42:39,414
I don't mean
to make you uncomfortable.

802
00:42:39,547 --> 00:42:40,481
It's okay.

803
00:42:41,782 --> 00:42:45,019
Do you think,
that you were his first?

804
00:42:46,387 --> 00:42:48,556
Yes. I like to think so.

805
00:42:49,724 --> 00:42:53,594
- But how do you know?
- You don't. You never know.

806
00:42:56,164 --> 00:42:56,932
[David] Hmm.

807
00:42:58,766 --> 00:43:00,469
He really hurt you, didn't he?

808
00:43:04,239 --> 00:43:05,106
Yeah, he did.

809
00:43:06,507 --> 00:43:08,342
Do you still see him
now and then?

810
00:43:09,077 --> 00:43:09,845
No.

811
00:43:11,679 --> 00:43:12,548
No, I don't.

812
00:43:13,614 --> 00:43:14,849
You know where he is?

813
00:43:14,983 --> 00:43:17,786
Yeah, I know
where he lives and everything

814
00:43:18,519 --> 00:43:19,822
but., mm..

815
00:43:21,188 --> 00:43:22,356
doesn't matter.

816
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:26,528
You know...

817
00:43:28,530 --> 00:43:29,898
I was in love once.

818
00:43:30,431 --> 00:43:32,099
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

819
00:43:32,233 --> 00:43:33,469
What happened?

820
00:43:38,072 --> 00:43:39,007
Well...

821
00:43:42,443 --> 00:43:44,978
she wanted a...

822
00:43:45,713 --> 00:43:46,948
she wanted to have a big family

823
00:43:47,081 --> 00:43:50,719
and...
I couldn't give it to her.

824
00:43:52,387 --> 00:43:53,388
Why not?

825
00:43:55,523 --> 00:43:59,361
I am... Just have
a little bit of a problem.

826
00:43:59,494 --> 00:44:00,662
[chuckles]

827
00:44:01,396 --> 00:44:02,798
I'm sorry.

828
00:44:03,864 --> 00:44:05,633
It's all right, you know.

829
00:44:05,766 --> 00:44:08,436
I mean, some people
can have kids some people can't.

830
00:44:10,139 --> 00:44:11,974
That's got to be
really hard though.

831
00:44:13,775 --> 00:44:14,608
Yeah.

832
00:44:15,610 --> 00:44:19,448
My... my father
always wanted grandchildren.

833
00:44:22,851 --> 00:44:23,552
[sighs]

834
00:44:23,684 --> 00:44:24,485
So...

835
00:44:27,054 --> 00:44:29,891
I can... I couldn't do it. I...

836
00:44:31,659 --> 00:44:36,831
It's okay.
Hey, hey, hey, it's okay.

837
00:44:40,001 --> 00:44:40,803
You know...

838
00:44:44,806 --> 00:44:46,675
being around someone like you...

839
00:44:48,643 --> 00:44:50,646
you know,
and you look the way you do...

840
00:44:52,047 --> 00:44:53,114
and you act the way you do...

841
00:44:53,248 --> 00:44:55,516
I'm sorry,
you're making me tear up.

842
00:44:57,217 --> 00:44:59,288
I just feel so bad for you.

843
00:45:02,856 --> 00:45:04,860
I mean,
that's going to be really hard.

844
00:45:07,661 --> 00:45:08,696
[David] Do you., um..

845
00:45:11,365 --> 00:45:14,469
do you ever think
that someone like you...

846
00:45:15,702 --> 00:45:19,106
would ever be interested
into someone like me?

847
00:45:19,708 --> 00:45:21,009
[chuckles]

848
00:45:21,675 --> 00:45:22,978
Of course.

849
00:45:25,445 --> 00:45:26,480
You're so sweet.

850
00:45:26,614 --> 00:45:27,548
[jarring indication]

851
00:45:30,918 --> 00:45:31,853
God!

852
00:45:34,255 --> 00:45:35,856
You're...
you're just something else.

853
00:45:35,990 --> 00:45:40,494
I just... I'm blown away by
your presence, your attitude...

854
00:45:41,862 --> 00:45:44,431
you're just so grown up
for your age.

855
00:45:44,565 --> 00:45:45,967
I get that a lot.

856
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:47,869
[chuckles]

857
00:45:50,070 --> 00:45:52,206
I'm an old soul.

858
00:45:53,074 --> 00:45:54,409
You could say that again.

859
00:45:55,443 --> 00:45:57,244
I like it here.
I like with you here.

860
00:45:57,378 --> 00:46:00,181
I like being here with you.
It's fun.

861
00:46:00,315 --> 00:46:02,617
- You do?
- I do, yeah.

862
00:46:02,751 --> 00:46:03,685
Why?

863
00:46:06,019 --> 00:46:07,788
Something different about you,
David.

864
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:14,362
Well, like what?

865
00:46:14,496 --> 00:46:15,631
Tell me what?

866
00:46:17,498 --> 00:46:20,233
I don't know. It's just...
I haven't figured it out yet.

867
00:46:20,367 --> 00:46:21,369
Give me a minute.

868
00:46:22,936 --> 00:46:24,038
It's just different. That's all.

869
00:46:26,706 --> 00:46:30,545
- You ever met anybody like me?
- Definitely not.

870
00:46:30,677 --> 00:46:34,482
No one like you in Durant,
that's for damn sure.

871
00:46:38,052 --> 00:46:40,020
- Hey, uh...
- Yeah.

872
00:46:41,222 --> 00:46:43,659
Do you mind if I hold your hand
while we walk a little bit?

873
00:46:46,693 --> 00:46:48,764
Okay, sure.

874
00:46:52,166 --> 00:46:53,701
[chuckles]

875
00:46:54,702 --> 00:46:56,771
You're silly, David.

876
00:46:56,905 --> 00:46:59,641
- [David] Why am I silly?
- I have no idea.

877
00:47:02,543 --> 00:47:05,180
- You're beautiful.
- Thank you.

878
00:47:05,847 --> 00:47:07,249
You're not so bad yourself.

879
00:47:08,115 --> 00:47:09,083
Thank you.

880
00:47:20,394 --> 00:47:22,264
That's awfully close.

881
00:47:28,068 --> 00:47:29,503
[chuckles]

882
00:47:33,907 --> 00:47:34,942
[David chuckles]

883
00:47:35,643 --> 00:47:36,744
What are you thinking?

884
00:47:37,644 --> 00:47:40,782
I'm thinking...

885
00:47:42,282 --> 00:47:43,384
is that...

886
00:47:44,719 --> 00:47:48,389
Oh! Wayne!
Get your ass over here.

887
00:47:49,891 --> 00:47:53,827
Laci! Oh, my God!
It's so good to see you.

888
00:47:53,961 --> 00:47:55,563
[Laci] It's so good to see you.
How are you?

889
00:47:55,697 --> 00:47:56,831
[David] Um...

890
00:47:56,963 --> 00:47:58,699
[indistinct conversation]

891
00:47:58,833 --> 00:47:59,867
Um...

892
00:48:00,001 --> 00:48:01,269
Oh, my God!
Are you still with Paula?

893
00:48:01,402 --> 00:48:02,136
[David] I'm...

894
00:48:03,637 --> 00:48:04,706
conducting an...

895
00:48:05,606 --> 00:48:07,009
important interview.

896
00:48:08,309 --> 00:48:10,512
You look amazing! Look at that.

897
00:48:10,644 --> 00:48:12,246
[David] I said that I was...

898
00:48:12,380 --> 00:48:14,415
- [Laci] Wow!
- [David] ...conducting a

899
00:48:14,548 --> 00:48:18,251
really important interview.

900
00:48:18,385 --> 00:48:20,021
[jarring indication]

901
00:48:20,155 --> 00:48:23,057
[David]
Did you hear what I'm saying?

902
00:48:24,826 --> 00:48:25,659
Did you?

903
00:48:25,793 --> 00:48:27,161
[Laci] What are you doing now?

904
00:48:27,295 --> 00:48:28,463
[David] Did you hear?

905
00:48:29,764 --> 00:48:32,733
Did you hear what I said?

906
00:48:33,768 --> 00:48:38,438
I am conducting an important
interview with her.

907
00:48:38,572 --> 00:48:40,074
[Laci]
David, hey! Calm down, okay?

908
00:48:40,208 --> 00:48:42,844
[David] What part did you not
understand, hillbilly mother fucker?

909
00:48:42,978 --> 00:48:44,512
- Listen.
- [David] Why don't you fucking go?

910
00:48:44,646 --> 00:48:46,214
- I don't give a flying fuck.
- I'm a really good friend...

911
00:48:46,347 --> 00:48:47,782
[David] Did you hear
what I fucking said?

912
00:48:47,916 --> 00:48:50,585
Get the fuck out of here! Go!

913
00:48:50,717 --> 00:48:51,819
Just get out of here!

914
00:48:51,952 --> 00:48:53,554
I said get the fuck out of here.

915
00:48:53,688 --> 00:48:57,090
- Fine, I'll leave.
- [David] A piece of shit. Yeah.

916
00:48:57,224 --> 00:48:58,927
- Yeah, that's right.
- [David] You don't forget it.

917
00:48:59,059 --> 00:49:00,094
I won't forget it.

918
00:49:00,228 --> 00:49:01,896
[somber music playing]

919
00:49:02,030 --> 00:49:04,565
[David] You turn around and walk
the other way now, you understand?

920
00:49:04,699 --> 00:49:05,967
- [Wayne] Okay.
- [David] Right now.

921
00:49:06,101 --> 00:49:07,269
I will
because I don't want to...

922
00:49:07,402 --> 00:49:10,271
[David] Right now!
I've heard enough from you.

923
00:49:10,405 --> 00:49:13,975
- Yeah, fine.
- [Laci] David, come here.

924
00:49:14,108 --> 00:49:15,876
- I'm out of here.
- [Laci] Get your...

925
00:49:16,010 --> 00:49:17,946
- [David] What are you waiting for?
- [Wayne] Whatever, man!

926
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:19,947
Forget you, man.
You're not worth it.

927
00:49:22,916 --> 00:49:24,518
[Laci]
What the hell is wrong with you?

928
00:49:24,652 --> 00:49:25,885
Get the camera out of my face.

929
00:49:26,019 --> 00:49:27,855
No,
get the camera out of my face.

930
00:49:27,989 --> 00:49:29,257
- What are you..
- Listen, listen to me.

931
00:49:29,389 --> 00:49:30,391
What do you think
that you're doing?

932
00:49:30,525 --> 00:49:31,459
I just...

933
00:49:31,592 --> 00:49:32,960
You can't treat people
like that.

934
00:49:34,728 --> 00:49:36,697
- [David] Laci, listen to me.
- Don't talk to me.

935
00:49:36,831 --> 00:49:38,099
- [David] Listen to me.
- No!

936
00:49:38,231 --> 00:49:39,434
- [David] Listen to me.
- Let go.

937
00:49:39,567 --> 00:49:41,603
[David]
I wanted this reaction from you.

938
00:49:41,735 --> 00:49:42,836
Do you understand?

939
00:49:42,969 --> 00:49:45,438
I told you,
it was important for me to see

940
00:49:45,572 --> 00:49:47,541
how you acted
in front of others.

941
00:49:47,675 --> 00:49:48,876
Would you listen?
Stop and listen to me, please.

942
00:49:49,010 --> 00:49:50,044
[Laci] No,
I don't want to listen to you.

943
00:49:50,177 --> 00:49:52,346
Just listen. I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it.

944
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:54,248
I didn't mean it at all, at all.

945
00:49:54,382 --> 00:49:56,150
You go over there
and you apologize to him.

946
00:49:58,320 --> 00:50:00,689
You want me to do this,
you apologize.

947
00:50:00,822 --> 00:50:02,090
- Listen, I'm sorry.
- No.

948
00:50:02,222 --> 00:50:04,759
You... not to me.
You apologize to him.

949
00:50:04,893 --> 00:50:06,561
I'm not the one
who needs apologizing to.

950
00:50:09,764 --> 00:50:10,865
Stop it.

951
00:50:14,735 --> 00:50:16,972
What is wrong with you? Stop it.

952
00:50:18,273 --> 00:50:20,041
[David]
Okay, okay, okay, listen to me.

953
00:50:20,175 --> 00:50:21,809
I'll go apologize.
Will that make you feel better?

954
00:50:21,943 --> 00:50:23,378
[Laci] Yes, it will.

955
00:50:23,510 --> 00:50:24,679
Go walk your ass over there

956
00:50:24,811 --> 00:50:26,480
and apologize
and get the camera out of my...

957
00:50:34,155 --> 00:50:35,990
[David] Come on,
where are you, Monica? Oh, God!

958
00:50:37,391 --> 00:50:38,592
There you are.

959
00:50:47,134 --> 00:50:47,936
David.

960
00:50:48,737 --> 00:50:49,671
Monica.

961
00:50:49,804 --> 00:50:52,574
- What are you doing here?
- Hi.

962
00:50:52,706 --> 00:50:54,574
- Hi.
- How you doing?

963
00:50:54,708 --> 00:50:55,976
How do you know where I live?

964
00:50:56,543 --> 00:51:00,147
Oh, well, you know, you... you, uh...
you signed your contract already

965
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:02,315
and your address was on it,
and I was in the neighborhood

966
00:51:02,449 --> 00:51:06,120
and I thought, "I wonder,
if Monica was around to, um,

967
00:51:06,253 --> 00:51:08,855
- you know, get her on film."
- Right.

968
00:51:08,989 --> 00:51:10,692
You know, since I'm doing
the reality film and all.

969
00:51:10,824 --> 00:51:13,960
Um, I... I thought we weren't going
to start this until next Saturday.

970
00:51:14,094 --> 00:51:15,762
Right. But, you know,
I was in the neighborhood

971
00:51:15,896 --> 00:51:18,331
and it's just a beautiful day,
and all and I thought...

972
00:51:18,465 --> 00:51:19,534
- Yeah, but I mean...
- ..."Oh, God!

973
00:51:19,666 --> 00:51:21,402
I hope she's around."
And here you are.

974
00:51:21,536 --> 00:51:24,172
Yeah, I didn't know you were
going to be filming me though.

975
00:51:24,304 --> 00:51:26,007
Is this going to be like
a regular thing now?

976
00:51:26,139 --> 00:51:28,909
- You're just going to film me wherever?
- No.

977
00:51:29,043 --> 00:51:31,311
- You certainly look great.
- Um, thank you.

978
00:51:31,445 --> 00:51:34,882
Uh, I didn't think,
I was going to be... be filmed.

979
00:51:35,016 --> 00:51:38,653
I just thought maybe if she was around
this would be great research for me

980
00:51:38,786 --> 00:51:41,521
and... and good practice
for you to be on film.

981
00:51:42,222 --> 00:51:46,126
Okay. Uh, well, I would
appreciate the heads up next time.

982
00:51:46,260 --> 00:51:47,561
Sure.
You know, I'm really sorry.

983
00:51:47,695 --> 00:51:49,231
I didn't mean, to make
you uncomfortable or any.

984
00:51:59,740 --> 00:52:01,809
[car engine starts]

985
00:52:08,516 --> 00:52:12,153
[suspenseful music playing]

986
00:52:27,969 --> 00:52:30,170
[Monica] All right. Well,
I'm going to take a shower now,

987
00:52:30,304 --> 00:52:32,072
so I'll talk to you later.

988
00:52:32,206 --> 00:52:34,108
Love you. Love you too. Bye.

989
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:37,746
[somber music playing]

990
00:52:42,782 --> 00:52:44,985
[water running]

991
00:53:11,211 --> 00:53:12,480
- Monica.
- Oh, my God!

992
00:53:12,612 --> 00:53:15,582
[somber music playing]

993
00:53:18,318 --> 00:53:20,019
[Monica screams]

994
00:53:20,153 --> 00:53:21,188
No!

995
00:53:22,623 --> 00:53:23,423
No!

996
00:53:23,556 --> 00:53:25,993
[Monica crying]

997
00:53:26,126 --> 00:53:27,561
[screams]

998
00:53:27,695 --> 00:53:29,197
Help!

999
00:53:30,998 --> 00:53:32,266
No! No!

1000
00:53:37,105 --> 00:53:39,708
No, no.

1001
00:53:40,974 --> 00:53:43,077
No, please stop this! Please!

1002
00:53:44,878 --> 00:53:45,713
Let me out!

1003
00:53:51,518 --> 00:53:54,021
[somber music playing]

1004
00:54:08,335 --> 00:54:09,204
[David] Hey.

1005
00:54:10,538 --> 00:54:11,271
Hi.

1006
00:54:11,838 --> 00:54:12,907
[David sighs]

1007
00:54:14,074 --> 00:54:16,643
- I said I was sorry to him.
- Mm-hmm.

1008
00:54:18,211 --> 00:54:21,583
- I told him what I was doing.
- Okay.

1009
00:54:23,818 --> 00:54:27,454
I still don't understand why you
think you have the right to do that

1010
00:54:27,588 --> 00:54:31,125
to people regardless of if
you're making a movie or not?

1011
00:54:31,259 --> 00:54:33,260
I mean, the things you said,
were absolutely horrible.

1012
00:54:34,695 --> 00:54:38,699
It wasn't even funny,
nor was it remotely appropriate.

1013
00:54:38,833 --> 00:54:40,068
[David sighs]

1014
00:54:41,469 --> 00:54:42,302
Listen.

1015
00:54:45,206 --> 00:54:46,173
[David sighs]

1016
00:54:48,208 --> 00:54:51,278
I just don't want you
to get hurt like you have been.

1017
00:54:51,411 --> 00:54:52,745
You just
don't want me to get hurt?

1018
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:54,248
How do you know he's...
I went to high school with him.

1019
00:54:54,382 --> 00:54:56,150
He's a friend.

1020
00:54:56,284 --> 00:54:58,586
He... he was dating one of my...
the girls on my cheerleading squad, Paula.

1021
00:54:58,719 --> 00:54:59,420
I mean...

1022
00:54:59,552 --> 00:55:00,554
He...

1023
00:55:00,688 --> 00:55:02,323
Laci.

1024
00:55:02,456 --> 00:55:04,626
I would be really grateful if I
could just take you home right now

1025
00:55:04,759 --> 00:55:07,461
and we could be done with
all of this because I'm sorry.

1026
00:55:07,594 --> 00:55:09,196
I don't think,
that you're for me.

1027
00:55:13,768 --> 00:55:18,373
Well, that really, really,
makes me sad, that you say that.

1028
00:55:18,505 --> 00:55:20,473
It really, really, does
because you know why?

1029
00:55:20,608 --> 00:55:21,543
Why?

1030
00:55:23,677 --> 00:55:26,514
Because I wanted... I want to
give you this part in this film.

1031
00:55:29,583 --> 00:55:33,421
You have shown me exactly

1032
00:55:33,554 --> 00:55:38,126
what an actress
should be and is.

1033
00:55:41,262 --> 00:55:43,698
I mean,
you're... you're amazing.

1034
00:55:43,831 --> 00:55:47,167
You're an amazing,
amazing woman,

1035
00:55:47,300 --> 00:55:48,369
not a girl.

1036
00:55:49,869 --> 00:55:52,806
and I'm sorry that I reacted
the way that I did.

1037
00:55:52,940 --> 00:55:58,445
I just... I'm sorry but I mean you... you
showed me exactly what I... what I needed.

1038
00:55:58,579 --> 00:56:01,783
And it's really important
for what I'm doing.

1039
00:56:01,916 --> 00:56:05,486
You know, there are so many
films out there that are bad.

1040
00:56:05,619 --> 00:56:08,489
There are so many actors out
there that are bad...

1041
00:56:10,523 --> 00:56:12,259
and you showed me what was real.

1042
00:56:16,097 --> 00:56:18,932
- I don't know, Mr. Ashland.
- Please.

1043
00:56:20,333 --> 00:56:21,301
I don't know.

1044
00:56:23,938 --> 00:56:25,273
Do you want to be an actress?

1045
00:56:26,606 --> 00:56:27,442
Yeah.

1046
00:56:29,476 --> 00:56:30,978
It's not that. I just...

1047
00:56:34,648 --> 00:56:38,418
you freaked me out, okay?
Like, you really freaked me out.

1048
00:56:41,322 --> 00:56:42,222
I'm...

1049
00:56:43,056 --> 00:56:43,824
[sighs]

1050
00:56:43,958 --> 00:56:45,559
please accept my apology.

1051
00:56:48,896 --> 00:56:52,900
And when we're shooting that won't happen.
I just had to make sure.

1052
00:56:53,034 --> 00:56:55,169
I had to be sure
that you were the one.

1053
00:56:59,306 --> 00:57:02,943
And listen to me, you're the one,
you're going to make this film.

1054
00:57:04,378 --> 00:57:05,413
I promise you.

1055
00:57:07,815 --> 00:57:13,253
And you're going to be a bright shining
star and everybody's going to see you.

1056
00:57:13,387 --> 00:57:16,391
Everybody is going to see you
the way that I really see you.

1057
00:57:17,458 --> 00:57:18,860
I'm going to make sure they do.

1058
00:57:22,028 --> 00:57:22,730
Okay?

1059
00:57:24,530 --> 00:57:27,134
Okay. Okay.

1060
00:57:27,266 --> 00:57:28,235
Forgive me?

1061
00:57:29,268 --> 00:57:30,170
Maybe.

1062
00:57:30,304 --> 00:57:31,338
[David chuckles]

1063
00:57:32,940 --> 00:57:34,208
Well, how about this?

1064
00:57:36,543 --> 00:57:40,314
How about I treat you to some...
some nice ice cream?

1065
00:57:40,447 --> 00:57:42,083
I do like ice cream.

1066
00:57:43,317 --> 00:57:45,119
Okay, we'll go.

1067
00:57:45,853 --> 00:57:48,556
- There's a Dairy Queen up the street.
- Perfect.

1068
00:57:50,690 --> 00:57:51,592
Come on.

1069
00:58:00,666 --> 00:58:04,538
I can't wait to show you some of the
footage that I've already shot of this.

1070
00:58:04,672 --> 00:58:06,907
- Oh, you've already shot footage?
- Oh, yeah!

1071
00:58:07,041 --> 00:58:09,443
- Oh, my God! I would love to see it.
- Oh, yeah.

1072
00:58:09,577 --> 00:58:11,144
You're the icing on the cake.

1073
00:58:11,277 --> 00:58:12,311
[laughs]

1074
00:58:12,445 --> 00:58:13,813
[car alarm chirps, buzzes]

1075
00:58:14,715 --> 00:58:16,784
We got to get that door fixed
for you sometime.

1076
00:58:16,918 --> 00:58:18,352
We got to do something.

1077
00:58:18,485 --> 00:58:21,222
[somber music playing]

1078
00:58:22,989 --> 00:58:24,925
[Jade] Somebody help me!

1079
00:58:25,059 --> 00:58:25,959
Somebody!

1080
00:58:26,092 --> 00:58:27,461
Someone!

1081
00:58:29,630 --> 00:58:30,631
Help me!

1082
00:58:30,764 --> 00:58:33,600
Help! Help me!

1083
00:58:33,733 --> 00:58:35,668
What do you want from me?
Help me!

1084
00:58:35,802 --> 00:58:36,938
Help me!

1085
00:58:38,237 --> 00:58:39,473
Oh, my God!

1086
00:58:39,940 --> 00:58:41,208
Help me!

1087
00:58:41,708 --> 00:58:45,012
Someone.
What do you want from me?

1088
00:58:45,445 --> 00:58:49,516
Let me out of here. Let me go!

1089
00:58:49,650 --> 00:58:52,186
Let me go!

1090
00:58:55,755 --> 00:58:58,759
[David] You know, I'm real excited
that you're taking this part.

1091
00:58:58,893 --> 00:59:01,295
I'm real excited
I'm taking this part too.

1092
00:59:01,429 --> 00:59:03,564
- I am honored.
- Oh, I'm honored!

1093
00:59:03,697 --> 00:59:06,634
Are you kidding me? Thank you so much
for giving me this opportunity, David.

1094
00:59:06,768 --> 00:59:09,302
Oh, you are so welcome.

1095
00:59:10,804 --> 00:59:13,574
- It's going to be real fun.
- It's going to be real fun, yeah.

1096
00:59:17,077 --> 00:59:21,215
What is this asshole in front of us doing?
Oh, my God! I mean, I'm sorry.

1097
00:59:21,349 --> 00:59:26,854
I don't mean to... And that is
why I don't drive. Oh, my God!

1098
00:59:26,987 --> 00:59:30,790
We're going to die.
Okay. I'm sorry.

1099
00:59:30,925 --> 00:59:33,260
[laughs]

1100
00:59:33,393 --> 00:59:37,096
- Okay and...
- That was close, wasn't it?

1101
00:59:37,231 --> 00:59:40,368
Well, you know what they say,
"Live for the moment", right?

1102
00:59:40,501 --> 00:59:43,304
'Cause you never know
when you're just going to die.

1103
00:59:43,436 --> 00:59:45,139
[both laugh]

1104
00:59:46,539 --> 00:59:48,476
Woo! Scared me a little bit.

1105
00:59:56,916 --> 00:59:58,119
Hello.

1106
01:00:01,422 --> 01:00:05,257
[woman speaking indistinctly
over radio]

1107
01:00:05,391 --> 01:00:09,362
Hi, can I just have one, um,
dip... chocolate dipped cone

1108
01:00:09,496 --> 01:00:10,963
and vanilla ice cream, please.

1109
01:00:11,097 --> 01:00:13,134
- And what would you like?
- Nothing.

1110
01:00:13,266 --> 01:00:15,134
- Are you sure?
- I'm positive, thank you.

1111
01:00:15,268 --> 01:00:18,138
Well, all right. Okay.
Thank you.

1112
01:00:24,043 --> 01:00:26,413
- Yeah, let me get this.
- Oh, no. You don't have to do that.

1113
01:00:26,547 --> 01:00:27,949
[David] Oh, no, no, certainly.

1114
01:00:31,585 --> 01:00:32,552
[Laci] Thank you.

1115
01:00:32,686 --> 01:00:34,021
[woman speaks indistinctly]

1116
01:00:34,155 --> 01:00:38,025
Oh, a small please. Thanks.
Sorry about that. Pardon me?

1117
01:00:39,626 --> 01:00:40,661
Thank you.

1118
01:00:43,329 --> 01:00:44,865
That happens, right?

1119
01:00:47,467 --> 01:00:48,436
So...

1120
01:00:50,704 --> 01:00:54,274
if you were to play any type of
role in a movie, what would it be?

1121
01:00:54,407 --> 01:00:56,210
Somewhere I get to wear
big, poofy dresses.

1122
01:00:59,612 --> 01:01:03,182
- Like period piece, maybe?
- Yeah, period piece. I'd love to do that.

1123
01:01:03,317 --> 01:01:07,088
Like my favorite movie was...
actually I really liked Titanic...

1124
01:01:07,221 --> 01:01:08,322
Oh, yeah.

1125
01:01:08,454 --> 01:01:10,458
...with Kate Winslet
and Leonardo DiCaprio.

1126
01:01:11,925 --> 01:01:13,693
Wouldn't you love to do a movie
with Leonardo?

1127
01:01:13,827 --> 01:01:17,498
Hmm, he's not really my type personally.
I mean, don't get me wrong.

1128
01:01:17,632 --> 01:01:19,199
He's really adorable and cute,

1129
01:01:19,333 --> 01:01:23,070
but I think, he likes the taller
model-y looking types.

1130
01:01:23,202 --> 01:01:25,639
So, when you say he's not your
type, do you mean as an actor

1131
01:01:25,771 --> 01:01:28,742
- or is it if you were to date him?
- No, no, he's a wonderful actor.

1132
01:01:28,876 --> 01:01:32,913
I think, that he actually...
he's one of the best actors out there.

1133
01:01:33,047 --> 01:01:35,115
But as for, um...

1134
01:01:35,248 --> 01:01:37,283
- Just checking your angles, you know.
- Sorry.

1135
01:01:37,418 --> 01:01:40,988
But as for like him and I, uh,
dating,

1136
01:01:41,121 --> 01:01:45,358
I... I prefer men like, uh,
Julian McMahon.

1137
01:01:45,492 --> 01:01:46,460
He's pretty.

1138
01:01:46,592 --> 01:01:47,560
[chuckles]

1139
01:01:47,695 --> 01:01:49,864
I don't think,
I know who that is.

1140
01:01:49,996 --> 01:01:53,000
Oh, he's just...
he's on <i>Nip Tuck</i> and a couple other shows.

1141
01:01:53,132 --> 01:01:58,105
And, you know, of course Orlando
Bloom, can't go wrong with him.

1142
01:01:59,306 --> 01:02:00,141
[David] Mm-hmm.

1143
01:02:02,943 --> 01:02:05,412
[somber music playing]

1144
01:02:05,545 --> 01:02:08,014
[humming]

1145
01:02:08,148 --> 01:02:09,617
So, how about you?

1146
01:02:09,750 --> 01:02:12,119
If you can date anybody,
who would you date?

1147
01:02:13,353 --> 01:02:14,487
- [woman] It's $1.14.
- Thank you.

1148
01:02:14,621 --> 01:02:16,389
[David]
Date anybody, who would I date?

1149
01:02:16,523 --> 01:02:21,863
Yeah, Catherine Zeta Jones,
Julia Roberts, uh, Kate Moss?

1150
01:02:24,164 --> 01:02:24,931
Well...

1151
01:02:27,134 --> 01:02:30,603
if you were a big actress, well,
you really wouldn't have to be one,

1152
01:02:30,737 --> 01:02:32,239
I might be interested
in dating you.

1153
01:02:32,373 --> 01:02:33,507
[laughs]

1154
01:02:33,641 --> 01:02:37,077
That's very sweet, David.
Thank you.

1155
01:02:37,210 --> 01:02:41,481
- [woman] Hope you have a nice day!
- You as well. Here you go.

1156
01:02:43,048 --> 01:02:43,884
[David] Thank you.

1157
01:02:45,318 --> 01:02:47,087
- [Laci] Oh, I'm sorry.
- Oh, that's all right. That's all right.

1158
01:02:47,221 --> 01:02:49,556
- It's just change.
- [Laci] I'm so sorry.

1159
01:02:49,688 --> 01:02:51,024
- [David] No worries.
- I'll get it in a minute.

1160
01:02:56,096 --> 01:02:56,862
Oh!

1161
01:02:56,996 --> 01:02:59,532
[David laughs]

1162
01:03:00,601 --> 01:03:04,038
I can't eat and drive at the same time.
I'm not that talented.

1163
01:03:08,976 --> 01:03:10,644
Thank you. It's very good.
Would you like some?

1164
01:03:10,777 --> 01:03:12,646
Oh, no. Thanks.
Knock yourself out.

1165
01:03:19,853 --> 01:03:20,887
Is it good?

1166
01:03:21,021 --> 01:03:22,690
- It's very good, yeah.
- It looks good.

1167
01:03:24,356 --> 01:03:27,594
- Can't go wrong with Dairy Queen, right?
- Mm-hmm, not at all.

1168
01:03:27,728 --> 01:03:28,596
[Laci chuckles]

1169
01:03:28,728 --> 01:03:29,429
So...

1170
01:03:31,864 --> 01:03:32,799
you were saying.

1171
01:03:34,134 --> 01:03:37,003
- You can't choose me. That's not fair.
- Why?

1172
01:03:37,137 --> 01:03:41,775
Because it has to be somebody
like Orlando Bloom or...

1173
01:03:41,909 --> 01:03:45,512
I... I am not attracted
to Orlando Bloom.

1174
01:03:45,646 --> 01:03:46,781
[chuckles]

1175
01:03:47,347 --> 01:03:50,550
- Sure?
- Yeah. I'm very sure.

1176
01:03:54,387 --> 01:03:56,324
Oh, well it has to be
someone like, you know,

1177
01:03:56,456 --> 01:03:58,558
someone big and famous,
not somebody...

1178
01:03:59,592 --> 01:04:01,228
[David sighs]

1179
01:04:01,360 --> 01:04:02,797
Natalie Portman.

1180
01:04:03,297 --> 01:04:04,365
[Laci] Mm.

1181
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:09,236
- I'd date her too.
- Ha, ha. You would?

1182
01:04:09,369 --> 01:04:12,839
No, no, but she's very good
actress and she's very pretty.

1183
01:04:13,606 --> 01:04:14,976
Are you into girls at all?

1184
01:04:17,476 --> 01:04:19,012
That's a random question.

1185
01:04:19,146 --> 01:04:22,182
Well, you're the one that just
said, "I would date her too."

1186
01:04:22,315 --> 01:04:24,484
- Are you sure?
- No, I don't do the girl thing.

1187
01:04:24,617 --> 01:04:25,485
I'm sorry.

1188
01:04:25,619 --> 01:04:26,787
Uh...

1189
01:04:27,554 --> 01:04:33,427
Like, you know, it's just kind of like,
I don't eat human beings, so, uh...

1190
01:04:34,527 --> 01:04:38,664
Okay.
That's a very good analogy.

1191
01:04:38,797 --> 01:04:41,534
Well, you know what I mean,
don't eat your own kind.

1192
01:04:41,668 --> 01:04:44,004
[David laughs]

1193
01:04:45,472 --> 01:04:46,640
[laughs]

1194
01:04:46,773 --> 01:04:48,142
- Hey.
- Hi.

1195
01:04:49,742 --> 01:04:52,179
Well, you know, since we're headed
back to my neck of the woods,

1196
01:04:52,311 --> 01:04:53,780
I wanted to take you here

1197
01:04:53,914 --> 01:04:57,951
and show you this great,
big old star because, you know what?

1198
01:04:58,085 --> 01:04:59,786
- What?
- That's what you're going to be.

1199
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:00,921
[laughs]

1200
01:05:01,054 --> 01:05:03,090
- You think so?
- I know so.

1201
01:05:04,657 --> 01:05:07,059
- Isn't it awesome?
- It's great.

1202
01:05:07,193 --> 01:05:08,728
[David]
You go stand right by it now.

1203
01:05:10,996 --> 01:05:12,998
Great big star that you are.

1204
01:05:13,132 --> 01:05:14,300
[laughs]

1205
01:05:15,202 --> 01:05:18,906
- So, uh, hey.
- What?

1206
01:05:19,806 --> 01:05:21,507
Speaking of neck of the woods,

1207
01:05:21,942 --> 01:05:25,246
um, since we're headed back
to my neck of the woods, um,

1208
01:05:25,713 --> 01:05:30,284
there's this... kind of this
special place I'd like to show you.

1209
01:05:30,416 --> 01:05:32,819
- Really?
- Would you like to see it?

1210
01:05:32,952 --> 01:05:35,121
Well, yeah.

1211
01:05:35,255 --> 01:05:38,992
I mean, if it's special to you,
I mean, yeah.

1212
01:05:39,125 --> 01:05:41,728
- I'd love to show you it.
- I'd love to see it.

1213
01:05:41,862 --> 01:05:42,762
- All right.
- Great.

1214
01:05:42,896 --> 01:05:44,530
- Come on.
- Okay, come on.

1215
01:05:44,664 --> 01:05:46,132
[both chuckle]

1216
01:05:46,266 --> 01:05:49,603
Thank you by the way, again,
for the part.

1217
01:05:49,735 --> 01:05:51,571
- Well, you know.
- I'm so excited.

1218
01:05:51,704 --> 01:05:56,409
You're perfect for it and
you're just precious, you know.

1219
01:05:57,443 --> 01:05:58,445
Aw!

1220
01:05:59,579 --> 01:06:02,449
- I'm going to save this battery again.
- Okay, bye again.

1221
01:06:02,581 --> 01:06:05,085
[somber music playing]

1222
01:06:08,021 --> 01:06:09,023
[David] Please...

1223
01:06:14,460 --> 01:06:15,562
call me David.

1224
01:06:19,266 --> 01:06:22,101
So, why do you like coming here?

1225
01:06:22,235 --> 01:06:25,705
Just helps me think, you know, with us
getting ready to do a movie and all.

1226
01:06:25,838 --> 01:06:27,039
Yeah.

1227
01:06:27,172 --> 01:06:30,209
And I'm really glad
that you came here with me.

1228
01:06:30,342 --> 01:06:34,914
- I really appreciate it.
- Of course. I mean, yeah.

1229
01:06:35,047 --> 01:06:36,582
You know, I've been meaning
to ask you something

1230
01:06:36,715 --> 01:06:39,152
and I don't mean to pry
or anything but...

1231
01:06:39,284 --> 01:06:39,985
Well, yeah.

1232
01:06:41,054 --> 01:06:43,090
What was your...
what was your sister's name?

1233
01:06:43,824 --> 01:06:45,625
[jarring indication]

1234
01:06:45,759 --> 01:06:46,592
[scoffs]

1235
01:06:46,726 --> 01:06:48,561
Why do you care?

1236
01:06:48,695 --> 01:06:51,832
I was just wondering because you
seem very standoffish with that.

1237
01:06:51,965 --> 01:06:53,434
It's just none of your business.

1238
01:06:56,235 --> 01:06:57,170
I'm sorry.

1239
01:06:57,771 --> 01:06:58,672
I...

1240
01:06:58,804 --> 01:07:00,773
- I'm really sorry.
- It's okay.

1241
01:07:00,907 --> 01:07:03,876
No, Laci Lee, listen,
I'm very excited for today.

1242
01:07:04,010 --> 01:07:07,581
Thank you so much
for allowing me to film you

1243
01:07:07,715 --> 01:07:09,316
and I'm so glad
that you've taken this part.

1244
01:07:09,449 --> 01:07:13,586
And... Well, thank you so much
for coming here with me today.

1245
01:07:15,588 --> 01:07:18,592
Look, I'm... I'm sorry. No.

1246
01:07:20,059 --> 01:07:24,097
- You ready to go?
- Her name was Jessica.

1247
01:07:28,034 --> 01:07:28,902
She was great.

1248
01:07:33,172 --> 01:07:35,908
I'm sorry I overreacted but...

1249
01:07:36,041 --> 01:07:37,344
That's okay.

1250
01:07:37,478 --> 01:07:40,880
No, that's, you know, no...
Really I'm... That's okay.

1251
01:07:41,014 --> 01:07:44,318
I'm...
Thanks for opening up to me.

1252
01:07:45,418 --> 01:07:47,520
Sure. Well, why don't we...
Let's go. Come on.

1253
01:07:47,653 --> 01:07:48,489
Sure.

1254
01:07:49,722 --> 01:07:50,824
[Laci] Don't want to step on...

1255
01:07:51,791 --> 01:07:54,595
[suspenseful music playing]

1256
01:08:07,206 --> 01:08:08,275
[chuckles]

1257
01:08:09,842 --> 01:08:11,511
I certainly enjoyed my day
with you.

1258
01:08:11,644 --> 01:08:13,614
I had a really nice day
with you too, thanks.

1259
01:08:16,282 --> 01:08:19,252
And, you know,
thank you so much for this role.

1260
01:08:19,386 --> 01:08:25,725
I've... I really appreciate it
and I'm really excited, so...

1261
01:08:25,859 --> 01:08:29,697
- You're not as excited as I am.
- Oh, you can go.

1262
01:08:30,462 --> 01:08:31,631
Yeah, okay.

1263
01:08:33,033 --> 01:08:35,869
Oh, it's so bright
and so hot in the summer.

1264
01:08:38,070 --> 01:08:41,641
- It's, um, right here, right?
- Yeah.

1265
01:08:41,774 --> 01:08:43,042
- Great.
- All right.

1266
01:08:43,176 --> 01:08:45,813
Well, I really look forward
to working with you

1267
01:08:45,945 --> 01:08:50,184
and, um, I mean you have all
my contact information, so...

1268
01:08:51,585 --> 01:08:54,221
Well, aren't you going to come
see some of the footage?

1269
01:08:56,489 --> 01:08:58,192
Well, um, you know,

1270
01:08:58,324 --> 01:09:01,627
it's just I have that concert and
because I have that date, you know.

1271
01:09:01,761 --> 01:09:05,831
And, um, I just...
It's... it's getting late.

1272
01:09:05,965 --> 01:09:07,534
Well, I... I understand and all,

1273
01:09:07,667 --> 01:09:11,805
but, uh, I'd really like
for you to see the footage.

1274
01:09:11,938 --> 01:09:14,707
I think, it'd be really
important research for you.

1275
01:09:15,507 --> 01:09:17,478
I mean,
it'll really only take a second.

1276
01:09:18,612 --> 01:09:20,814
Yeah, well...

1277
01:09:20,947 --> 01:09:24,585
Laci, listen,
it'll really only take a second.

1278
01:09:29,221 --> 01:09:31,324
- Okay.
- Great.

[Laci] This place is a lot
further than you said it was.

1289
01:10:20,207 --> 01:10:23,710
I'm sorry, Laci,
but places like these need a lot of space.

1290
01:10:23,842 --> 01:10:26,278
- Come on in.
- Well, what is it?

1291
01:10:26,412 --> 01:10:28,881
This is my very own soundstage.

1292
01:10:29,015 --> 01:10:31,885
Is that code for like
your den of sex?

1294
01:10:33,485 --> 01:10:36,088
Well, you'll be the first
to find out, won't you?

1295
01:10:36,222 --> 01:10:37,791
With my luck, probably.

1296
01:10:37,925 --> 01:10:39,025
[David laughs]

1297
01:10:39,158 --> 01:10:41,729
I mean, that in the nicest way
by the way.

1298
01:10:41,862 --> 01:10:43,462
Of course.

1299
01:10:43,596 --> 01:10:45,097
I mean, I wasn't saying that you
weren't attractive or anything.

1300
01:10:45,231 --> 01:10:48,167
- I was just saying that, um...
- That's okay.

1301
01:10:48,301 --> 01:10:49,603
[laughs]

1302
01:10:49,737 --> 01:10:51,971
Laci, there isn't anything
you can say that'd upset me.

1303
01:10:53,439 --> 01:10:56,143
- Not one little thing?
- Not one thing.

1304
01:10:57,810 --> 01:10:59,680
What if I told you
I wasn't going to go in there?

1305
01:10:59,813 --> 01:11:01,814
What if I told you I was just
going to walk back to my car

1306
01:11:01,948 --> 01:11:03,417
and get in and drive away?

1307
01:11:03,550 --> 01:11:06,619
Well, I would tell you that you
wouldn't be up for that Oscar

1308
01:11:06,752 --> 01:11:08,087
that I know that you're going
to win after this.

1309
01:11:08,220 --> 01:11:10,489
What if I told you
I didn't want to win an Oscar?

1310
01:11:10,622 --> 01:11:12,358
But I know you do.

1311
01:11:12,492 --> 01:11:13,860
I know you want that award.

1312
01:11:14,828 --> 01:11:17,363
I know you want best actress
because that's what you are

1313
01:11:17,497 --> 01:11:20,734
and that's what I see,
and that's what you're going to be.

1314
01:11:20,867 --> 01:11:24,471
- You're a manipulative little shit.
- Am I now?

1315
01:11:24,604 --> 01:11:26,773
Come on and show me
your fucking sound stage.

1316
01:11:26,905 --> 01:11:28,041
I got to go.

1317
01:11:28,841 --> 01:11:31,845
Okay, but you know, I've been
working here since the beginning.

1318
01:11:31,979 --> 01:11:33,646
How long has that been?

1319
01:11:33,779 --> 01:11:38,717
It's quite a long time. You know,
my work has taken me years to perfect.

1320
01:11:38,851 --> 01:11:40,354
[Laci] I bet it has.

1321
01:11:42,322 --> 01:11:44,958
- How old are you anyway?
- Old enough.

1322
01:11:48,595 --> 01:11:49,930
Just like anything...

1323
01:11:52,631 --> 01:11:54,299
you have to stick to it.

1324
01:11:54,434 --> 01:11:58,137
- Of course, understandably.
- Wow, you still look great.

1325
01:11:59,171 --> 01:12:00,773
Oh. Um...

1326
01:12:03,842 --> 01:12:04,778
[chuckles]

1327
01:12:05,444 --> 01:12:06,979
It sure is dark in here.

1328
01:12:08,280 --> 01:12:09,082
Yeah.

1329
01:12:10,550 --> 01:12:12,351
I could, uh... I'll change that.

1330
01:12:13,485 --> 01:12:14,988
So...

1331
01:12:15,121 --> 01:12:16,922
You were going to show me some
footage or something, right?

1332
01:12:17,055 --> 01:12:18,024
Yeah.

1333
01:12:19,359 --> 01:12:21,394
I'm sorry, Laci.
I'm just so excited that you're here

1334
01:12:21,528 --> 01:12:26,033
because with you accepting
this final role in my film...

1335
01:12:27,234 --> 01:12:29,036
I'm on my way to best picture.

1336
01:12:30,869 --> 01:12:31,703
[chuckles]

1337
01:12:32,270 --> 01:12:35,273
- So you ready?
- Yeah, sure.

1338
01:12:35,408 --> 01:12:36,943
Okay, I'm going to...

1339
01:12:37,076 --> 01:12:40,313
But look, I really got to go
after this, okay?

1340
01:12:40,445 --> 01:12:43,248
You know, because I have that date
and everything, so I got to...

1341
01:12:43,382 --> 01:12:46,051
Sure, I remember.

1342
01:12:46,886 --> 01:12:51,057
So, if you can just, uh,
hold on to this camera.

1343
01:12:51,190 --> 01:12:52,458
- [Laci] Yeah.
- Just be careful.

1344
01:12:52,591 --> 01:12:55,027
I'm going to go turn on
the overhead light for us, okay?

1345
01:12:55,161 --> 01:12:55,962
[Laci] Okay.

1346
01:12:56,662 --> 01:12:59,065
Oh, that's all right.

1347
01:13:07,039 --> 01:13:10,409
[Laci humming]

1348
01:13:29,462 --> 01:13:30,264
David?

1349
01:13:35,667 --> 01:13:36,636
David!

1350
01:13:43,877 --> 01:13:45,812
I thought you were
turning the lights on.

1351
01:13:53,520 --> 01:13:55,989
David, this isn't funny.

1352
01:13:57,756 --> 01:13:58,991
Not laughing.

1353
01:14:04,162 --> 01:14:05,064
David!

1354
01:14:08,534 --> 01:14:11,203
I'm going to go if the lights
don't come on right now. I mean it.

1355
01:14:13,372 --> 01:14:14,907
David, I really have to go.

1356
01:14:16,809 --> 01:14:21,748
[door thudding]

1357
01:14:25,318 --> 01:14:26,920
David, the door is locked.

1358
