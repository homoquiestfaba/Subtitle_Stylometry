71
00:03:10,424 --> 00:03:11,223
- All right, O.K.

72
00:03:11,225 --> 00:03:12,024
I'll call you later.

73
00:03:12,026 --> 00:03:12,958
You... don't worry.

74
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,060
Just, just don't.

75
00:03:15,062 --> 00:03:16,061
- Thank you.

76
00:03:16,063 --> 00:03:17,129
- Hey, listen.

77
00:03:17,131 --> 00:03:18,764
- I didn't have much.

78
00:03:18,766 --> 00:03:21,533
Absent father, mother with two

79
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:24,203
low-paying jobs and my sister

80
00:03:24,205 --> 00:03:26,772
Mary, my big sister, who always

81
00:03:26,774 --> 00:03:29,408
dreamed of becoming a doctor.

82
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:31,210
But, hard as my mother worked,

83
00:03:31,212 --> 00:03:32,211
she couldn't keep up the

84
00:03:32,213 --> 00:03:33,879
payments on our little house.

85
00:03:33,881 --> 00:03:35,214
And one day the bank came

86
00:03:35,216 --> 00:03:37,015
and foreclosed on us.

87
00:03:37,017 --> 00:03:38,283
<i-> Larry Becker was

88
00:03:38,285 --> 00:03:40,152
<i>born to run for office.</i>

89
00:03:40,154 --> 00:03:41,286
<i>He's taken on the wall street</i>

90

<i>banks, who in return,</i>

91
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:43,422
<i>have declared jihad</i>

92
00:03:43,424 --> 00:03:44,423
<i>against him.</i>

93
00:03:44,425 --> 00:03:45,390
<i>And he's in a bare-knuckled</i>

94
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:46,792
<i>reelection campaign against a</i>

95
00:03:46,794 --> 00:03:48,627
<i>crazy ex-baseball player.</i>

96
00:03:48,629 --> 00:03:51,096
- First we moved into a

97
00:03:51,098 --> 00:03:53,498
homeless shelter, but that

98
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,700
wasn't safe.

99
00:03:54,702 --> 00:03:56,602
Eventually we found a tiny

100
00:03:56,604 --> 00:03:57,703
one-bedroom apartment--

101
00:03:57,705 --> 00:03:58,737
the three of us.

102
00:03:58,739 --> 00:03:59,871
- The press will most likely

103
00:03:59,873 --> 00:04:01,373
have questions about Afghan

104
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:02,608
troop levels, the Travis base

105
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:04,209
closing, levies, the budget

106
00:04:04,211 --> 00:04:05,644
debates-- just blow through

107
00:04:05,646 --> 00:04:06,945
those questions and pivot to our

108
00:04:06,947 --> 00:04:08,714
message of the day.

109
00:04:08,716 --> 00:04:09,681
- All right, great.

110
00:04:09,683 --> 00:04:10,349
Got it.

111
00:04:10,351 --> 00:04:12,951
Thank you guys.

112
00:04:12,953 --> 00:04:14,319
Ah.

113
00:04:14,321 --> 00:04:15,687
All right, show time.

114
00:04:15,689 --> 00:04:16,555
<i-> Stephen Green is the

115
00:04:16,557 --> 00:04:17,556
<i>real deal.</i>

116
00:04:17,558 --> 00:04:19,291

00:04:20,661 --> 00:04:21,526

119
00:04:21,528 --> 00:04:23,061
<i>Duff Campbell, who has none of</i>

120
00:04:23,063 --> 00:04:24,463
<i>those things, but duff does</i>

00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:27,065
<i>money, which is the mother's</i>

123
00:04:27,067 --> 00:04:29,334
<i>milk of all politics.</i>

124
00:04:29,336 --> 00:04:30,669
- My mama struggled day and

125
00:04:30,671 --> 00:04:33,038
night, but it wasn't enough.

126
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,506
Eventually, my, my sister Mary,

127
00:04:34,508 --> 00:04:36,341
she had to quit high school,

128
00:04:36,343 --> 00:04:37,943
get a job as a waitress.

129
00:04:37,945 --> 00:04:38,944
Both of them working just to

130
00:04:38,946 --> 00:04:40,279
provide me with some food,

131
00:04:40,281 --> 00:04:41,246
clothing and a roof over

132
00:04:41,248 --> 00:04:42,948
- What do you say about

133
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:43,782
Campbell's charge that you're

134
00:04:43,784 --> 00:04:45,484
- What is the air force

135
00:04:45,486 --> 00:04:46,485
going to do about the Travis

136
00:04:46,487 --> 00:04:47,319
base closing? - As a former

137
00:04:47,321 --> 00:04:48,487
Navy seal, what do you think of

138
00:04:48,489 --> 00:04:49,321
the way they handled it?

139
00:04:49,323 --> 00:04:50,322
- Gas prices are at a record

140
00:04:50,324 --> 00:04:50,989
high, companies are making

141
00:04:50,991 --> 00:04:51,657
enormous profits--

142
00:04:51,659 --> 00:04:52,924
what's your response?

143
00:04:52,926 --> 00:04:53,925
- O.K., guys, these are great

144
00:04:53,927 --> 00:04:54,926
questions, I'm going to get to

145
00:04:54,928 --> 00:04:55,761
all these, but my primary

146
00:04:55,763 --> 00:04:56,762
purpose here today is to talk

147
00:04:56,764 --> 00:04:57,596
about our most precious natural

148
00:04:57,598 --> 00:04:59,898
resource, which is our children.

149
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,533
We now live in a country where

150
00:05:01,535 --> 00:05:02,401
over two-thirds of the

151
00:05:02,403 --> 00:05:03,735
population is overweight.

152
00:05:03,737 --> 00:05:06,204
Now 90% of our middle schools no

153
00:05:06,206 --> 00:05:09,308
longer have daily gym classes.

154
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:10,509
- At night I'd hear my

155
00:05:10,511 --> 00:05:11,643
mama come home from her late

156
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:15,013
shift at the tanning plant.

157
00:05:15,015 --> 00:05:19,184
As I lay there in bed...

158
00:05:19,186 --> 00:05:23,288
I could hear my mama cry.

159
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:25,791
And I ask you, how is it

160
00:05:25,793 --> 00:05:29,194
possible that a country that can

161
00:05:29,196 --> 00:05:31,029
afford to bail out the wall

162
00:05:31,031 --> 00:05:32,931
street banks to the tune of over

163
00:05:32,933 --> 00:05:36,768
$2 trillion-- trillion--

164
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:37,703
how could that country not

165
00:05:37,705 --> 00:05:39,771
afford to have those same banks

166
00:05:39,773 --> 00:05:41,173
from taking away the American

167
00:05:41,175 --> 00:05:43,809
dream from so many hard-working

168
00:05:43,811 --> 00:05:44,476
Americans?

169
00:05:44,478 --> 00:05:46,712
It's just not right!

170
00:05:46,714 --> 00:05:47,946
- This is a crisis.

171
00:05:47,948 --> 00:05:49,281
And it's a crisis that we owe it

172
00:05:49,283 --> 00:05:50,916
to our children to solve.

173
00:05:50,918 --> 00:05:53,251
And the time to solve it is now.

174
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:56,855
- ...Afghan troop levels,

175
00:05:56,857 --> 00:05:57,789
senator!

176
00:05:57,791 --> 00:05:58,457
- Hey, Reed?

177
00:05:58,459 --> 00:05:59,324
Hey.

178
00:05:59,326 --> 00:06:00,492
Why don't you go fishing for the

179
00:06:00,494 --> 00:06:01,326
three-day weekend, we'll dump

180
00:06:01,328 --> 00:06:03,061
the divorce news after

181
00:06:03,063 --> 00:06:04,363
five on Friday by tipping

182
00:06:04,365 --> 00:06:06,331
the A.P. To the legal filings on

183
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:07,532
an embargoed basis.

184
00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:09,000
They'll play on the wires after

185
00:06:09,002 --> 00:06:10,235
seven, it's the perfect time for

186
00:06:10,237 --> 00:06:11,770
a document dump.

187
00:06:11,772 --> 00:06:15,774
All right, talk to you later.

188
00:06:15,776 --> 00:06:17,309
He'll live.

189
00:06:20,247 --> 00:06:24,750
- Whoo!

190
00:06:24,752 --> 00:06:25,784
- Ca-ching!

191
00:06:25,786 --> 00:06:27,819
Money shot-- message of the day.

192
00:06:27,821 --> 00:06:29,621
- This one's yours, all right?

193
00:06:29,623 --> 00:06:32,457
Oh, God!

194
00:06:32,459 --> 00:06:33,392
- Sir, are you O.K.?

195
00:06:33,394 --> 00:06:35,660
- Yeah, I'm all right.

196
00:06:35,662 --> 00:06:37,362
All right!

197
00:06:37,364 --> 00:06:38,397
Come on!

198
00:06:41,969 --> 00:06:44,169
- Same thing?

199
00:06:44,171 --> 00:06:48,039
- Yes, yes.

200
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:49,841
- Now, as I stand here in the

201
00:06:49,843 --> 00:06:51,977
governor's house-- the people's

202
00:06:51,979 --> 00:06:54,746
house-- I am using the power of

203
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:58,016
this house to help keep the

204
00:06:58,018 --> 00:06:59,518
people of Kentucky in

205
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,353
their houses.

206
00:07:01,355 --> 00:07:03,321
Today I am sending a bill to the

207
00:07:03,323 --> 00:07:04,890
State Senate that offers

208
00:07:04,892 --> 00:07:07,192
real and solid protection from

209
00:07:07,194 --> 00:07:09,194
the kind of cruel foreclosures

210
00:07:09,196 --> 00:07:10,695
that my mama and so many

211
00:07:10,697 --> 00:07:12,531
hard-working Kentuckians

212
00:07:12,533 --> 00:07:15,467
have been forced to endure.

213
00:07:15,469 --> 00:07:17,502
And I'm asking for you to

214
00:07:17,504 --> 00:07:19,771
back me on this.

215
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:23,575
It's... it's fair, it's decent

216
00:07:23,577 --> 00:07:24,676
and it is right!

217
00:07:33,252 --> 00:07:34,853
...you don't have to do that--

218
00:07:34,855 --> 00:07:37,022
you're an aide, not a waitress.

219
00:07:37,024 --> 00:07:39,691
- It's my pleasure.

220
00:07:39,693 --> 00:07:42,828
And can I ask you something?

221
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:44,763
- Of course.

222
00:07:44,765 --> 00:07:45,764
- How much of that story you

223
00:07:45,766 --> 00:07:48,700
just told is true?

224
00:07:48,702 --> 00:07:51,937
- Helena...

225
00:07:51,939 --> 00:07:54,473
One hundred percent.

226
00:07:54,475 --> 00:07:56,374
- Really?

227
00:07:56,376 --> 00:07:58,877
- Aw...

228
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,612
Come here.

229
00:08:18,098 --> 00:08:19,364
- Room 1600?

230
00:08:19,366 --> 00:08:21,066
- You're tawny?

231
00:08:21,068 --> 00:08:22,467
- To the rescue.

232
00:08:22,469 --> 00:08:24,269
1600?

233
00:08:24,271 --> 00:08:26,104
- Down the hall to your left.

234
00:08:28,342 --> 00:08:29,341
Hey, could you be a bit

235
00:08:29,343 --> 00:08:30,575
more obvious?

236
00:08:30,577 --> 00:08:31,576
- I thought he was getting a

237
00:08:31,578 --> 00:08:32,711
masseuse, not some starlet

238
00:08:32,713 --> 00:08:34,145
playing a masseuse.

239
00:08:34,147 --> 00:08:35,380
- Hey, she and her company

240
00:08:35,382 --> 00:08:36,348
were vetted.

241
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:37,482
She had the recs.

242
00:08:37,484 --> 00:08:38,149
- Yeah.

243
00:08:38,151 --> 00:08:38,984
She has the killer bod,

244
00:08:38,986 --> 00:08:40,285
that's the only rec that counts.

245
00:08:40,287 --> 00:08:41,453
You know, come to think of it,

246
00:08:41,455 --> 00:08:43,655
my back feels stiff too.

247
00:08:43,657 --> 00:08:44,589
- Yeah, that's not the only

248
00:08:44,591 --> 00:08:46,291
thing, you jerk.

249
00:08:51,999 --> 00:08:52,831
- In Kentucky, we're going to

250
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:54,099
the mattresses.

251
00:08:54,101 --> 00:08:54,766
- I've got some ideas

252
00:08:54,768 --> 00:08:55,634
on the statement.

253
00:08:55,636 --> 00:08:56,902
- Well, they'd better be good

254
00:08:56,904 --> 00:08:57,869
because if he goes down,

255
00:08:57,871 --> 00:08:59,037
it's gonna be a four-day school

256
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:00,405
week there, minimum wage will

257
00:09:00,407 --> 00:09:02,741
drop to 75 cents an hour,

258
00:09:02,743 --> 00:09:03,742
you'll be able to light the

259
00:09:03,744 --> 00:09:04,910
Kentucky rivers on fire.

260
00:09:06,547 --> 00:09:07,812
- How late are we?

261
00:09:07,814 --> 00:09:10,415
- Real time or Paul time?

262
00:09:10,417 --> 00:09:11,416
Exactly on time.

263
00:09:11,418 --> 00:09:12,918
How do you know this person?

264
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:13,785
- She's my law school

265
00:09:13,787 --> 00:09:15,053
roommate's sister.

266
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:16,221
But the object is to get in,

267
00:09:16,223 --> 00:09:17,389
get out and get back to the

268
00:09:17,391 --> 00:09:18,056
Kentucky mess.

269
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:18,757
- Max!

270
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:21,426
Julia!

271
00:09:21,428 --> 00:09:22,928
- Yes?

272
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:24,329
- Get me Paul.

273
00:09:24,331 --> 00:09:28,166
Get him now.

274
00:09:28,168 --> 00:09:28,867
- Senator, let's just go

275
00:09:28,869 --> 00:09:30,435
through this bit by bit.

276
00:09:30,437 --> 00:09:32,571
What are we talking about here?

277
00:09:32,573 --> 00:09:33,238
- She's claiming that

278
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,606
we did it.

279
00:09:34,608 --> 00:09:35,674
- Well, did what?

280
00:09:35,676 --> 00:09:37,442
A happy ending, or...

281
00:09:37,444 --> 00:09:39,210
- More.

282
00:09:39,212 --> 00:09:40,211
I'm sure she thinks it'll

283
00:09:40,213 --> 00:09:41,613
get her a bigger check.

284
00:09:41,615 --> 00:09:42,781
Look man, I am dying because of

285
00:09:42,783 --> 00:09:44,549
your photo op and now I'm dying

286
00:09:44,551 --> 00:09:46,618
because of this fucking psycho.

287
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:48,353
- And what kind of masseuse is

288
00:09:48,355 --> 00:09:50,155
this, like a masseuse-masseuse

289
00:09:50,157 --> 00:09:51,489
or an escort?

290
00:09:51,491 --> 00:09:52,557
- Julia got her from the

291
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:55,026
speaker of the assembly!

292
00:09:55,028 --> 00:09:55,961
- We're in room five.

293
00:09:55,963 --> 00:09:56,962
- O.K., how many people know

294
00:09:56,964 --> 00:09:57,662
about this?

295
00:09:57,664 --> 00:09:58,997
- Just us.

296
00:09:58,999 --> 00:10:01,066
Come on man, this is--

297
00:10:01,068 --> 00:10:03,234
this could be a career killer.

298
00:10:03,236 --> 00:10:04,703
- O.K., I need 15 minutes

299
00:10:04,705 --> 00:10:07,072
here-- make it 10-- and I'm

300
00:10:07,074 --> 00:10:10,141
on this.

301
00:10:10,143 --> 00:10:10,842
- Look out the door:

302
00:10:10,844 --> 00:10:11,776
Malnourished children,

303
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:13,511
aids rampant, people looking for

304
00:10:13,513 --> 00:10:14,813
decent jobs-- or any job for

305
00:10:14,815 --> 00:10:16,181
that matter.

306
00:10:16,183 --> 00:10:17,215
The victims of an education

307
00:10:17,217 --> 00:10:19,084
system horribly broken,

308
00:10:19,086 --> 00:10:20,485
and hope, something in extremely

309
00:10:20,487 --> 00:10:21,553
short supply.

310
00:10:21,555 --> 00:10:23,288
- I completely agree and I can

311
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:25,357
only imagine what it's like to

312
00:10:25,359 --> 00:10:27,626
try to run this every year.

313
00:10:27,628 --> 00:10:28,627
And next year, you're going to

314
00:10:28,629 --> 00:10:29,494
have even less money for

315
00:10:29,496 --> 00:10:30,295
this clinic.

316
00:10:30,297 --> 00:10:32,263
So in terms of fund-raising,

317
00:10:32,265 --> 00:10:33,431
I think I should put you in

318
00:10:33,433 --> 00:10:34,599
touch with some deep pocket guys

319
00:10:34,601 --> 00:10:36,868
in Woodside, Pacific Heights,

320
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:37,902
Internet do-good-er--

321
00:10:37,904 --> 00:10:42,073
- I want to run for governor.

322
00:10:42,075 --> 00:10:44,776
- Excuse me?

323
00:10:44,778 --> 00:10:47,912
- I want to run for governor.

324
00:10:47,914 --> 00:10:49,314
- Well, I guess that's

325
00:10:49,316 --> 00:10:51,650
one way to solve your problem.

326
00:10:51,652 --> 00:10:53,284
O.K., do you mind if I ask

327
00:10:53,286 --> 00:10:54,552
you why?

328
00:10:54,554 --> 00:10:55,553
- For nine years, I have worked

329
00:10:55,555 --> 00:10:57,288
12, 14 hours a day here,

330
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:58,123
seeing what's working in our

331
00:10:58,125 --> 00:10:59,524
society and more importantly,

332
00:10:59,526 --> 00:11:00,592
what isn't.

333
00:11:00,594 --> 00:11:01,559
And I'm not just

334
00:11:01,561 --> 00:11:02,293
a physician, I--

335
00:11:03,263 --> 00:11:03,995
- I'm really sorry.

336
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:05,830
- What do you want me to tell

337
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:07,232
- nothing from children's?

338
00:11:07,234 --> 00:11:08,400
O.K., we're going to have to

339
00:11:08,402 --> 00:11:09,534
road trip it.

340
00:11:09,536 --> 00:11:10,535
Get in their faces, guilt them

341
00:11:10,537 --> 00:11:11,603
into the transplant.

342
00:11:11,605 --> 00:11:13,071
And ask the O.R. nurses when

343
00:11:13,073 --> 00:11:14,072
Chris Anderson gets out of

344
00:11:14,074 --> 00:11:15,173
his last surgery.

345
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:16,441
- Sure.

346
00:11:16,443 --> 00:11:17,442
Dim sum on the way back?

347
00:11:17,444 --> 00:11:19,511
- Perfect, thanks.

348
00:11:19,513 --> 00:11:20,912
Sorry. My life.

349
00:11:20,914 --> 00:11:21,746
Anyway...

350
00:11:21,748 --> 00:11:23,114
I'm not just a physician, I also

351
00:11:23,116 --> 00:11:25,216
do community organizing, a job

352
00:11:25,218 --> 00:11:26,384
qualification that didn't hurt

353
00:11:26,386 --> 00:11:27,285
our president.

354
00:11:27,287 --> 00:11:29,120
And uh, not to sound too

355
00:11:29,122 --> 00:11:30,789
immodest, but I think I can make

356
00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:32,157
people's lives better.

357
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:33,324
- Look, forgive me.

358
00:11:33,326 --> 00:11:34,325
You're Dan's sister and I love

359
00:11:34,327 --> 00:11:35,694
him and you seem like a very

360
00:11:35,696 --> 00:11:38,096
nice person yourself, but I

361
00:11:38,098 --> 00:11:39,431
gotta tell you, and I think as a

362
00:11:39,433 --> 00:11:40,432
doctor you'll understand when

363
00:11:40,434 --> 00:11:41,599
I say this, you need to have

364
00:11:41,601 --> 00:11:42,667
your head examined.

365
00:11:42,669 --> 00:11:44,536
I mean, seriously, because this

366
00:11:44,538 --> 00:11:45,670
is insane.

367
00:11:45,672 --> 00:11:46,604
- Running a free clinic with

368
00:11:46,606 --> 00:11:47,639
what the state gives me,

369
00:11:47,641 --> 00:11:49,607
that's insane too.

370
00:11:49,609 --> 00:11:52,243
- O.K., um, all right, we had

371
00:11:52,245 --> 00:11:53,244
something that came up, so I

372
00:11:53,246 --> 00:11:54,345
don't have a ton of time,

373
00:11:54,347 --> 00:11:55,447
but let me just walk you

374
00:11:55,449 --> 00:11:57,082
through this.

375
00:11:57,084 --> 00:11:59,217
If you are ballsy enough or

376
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:01,820
crazy enough to do this, I can

377
00:12:01,822 --> 00:12:04,589
promise you an unending barrage

378
00:12:04,591 --> 00:12:07,826
of innuendo, vitriol and lies.

379
00:12:07,828 --> 00:12:08,827
Everything will be on the public

380
00:12:08,829 --> 00:12:10,095
record, from the dope that you

381
00:12:10,097 --> 00:12:11,896
smoked in the 11th grade,

382
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:13,064
to the blow you did with your

383
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:14,566
girlfriends during your college

384
00:12:14,568 --> 00:12:16,735
lesbian experimentation period.

385
00:12:16,737 --> 00:12:19,971
There's not one moment of your

386
00:12:19,973 --> 00:12:21,005
past that will not be

387
00:12:21,007 --> 00:12:22,540
scrutinized in

388
00:12:22,542 --> 00:12:24,509
excruciating detail.

389
00:12:24,511 --> 00:12:25,276
- Done?

390
00:12:25,278 --> 00:12:26,211
- Not yet.

391
00:12:26,213 --> 00:12:28,079
After that all comes out and

392
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:30,615
more, the facts will be twisted,

393
00:12:30,617 --> 00:12:32,417
stomped and exaggerated to the

394
00:12:32,419 --> 00:12:33,418
point that you will no longer

395
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:34,719
recognize them.

396
00:12:34,721 --> 00:12:36,087
And if that doesn't do it,

397
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:38,923
new facts will be made up so

398
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:40,291
they can destroy you.

399
00:12:40,293 --> 00:12:40,992
- Done?

400
00:12:40,994 --> 00:12:41,760
- Not yet.

401
00:12:41,762 --> 00:12:42,927
And then they'll say--

402
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:44,796
and, I'll say it right now--

403
00:12:44,798 --> 00:12:46,231
what the hell qualifications do

404
00:12:46,233 --> 00:12:47,632
you have to be governor?

405
00:12:47,634 --> 00:12:50,034
- In my job, I work with every

406
00:12:50,036 --> 00:12:51,603
sort of person, a giant array

407
00:12:51,605 --> 00:12:52,871
of problems.

408
00:12:52,873 --> 00:12:54,005
I run a team that daily

409
00:12:54,007 --> 00:12:55,640
produces real, tangible results.

410
00:12:55,642 --> 00:12:57,842
I see our problems up close, and

411
00:12:57,844 --> 00:12:59,377
I think that I can bring people

412
00:12:59,379 --> 00:13:00,779
together to accomplish things--

413
00:13:00,781 --> 00:13:01,880
good things.

414
00:13:01,882 --> 00:13:02,914
- Good things? - Yes.

415
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:03,581
- Excuse me.

416
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:04,415
This isn't a high school

417
00:13:04,417 --> 00:13:05,817
service club, O.K.?

418
00:13:05,819 --> 00:13:06,684
Getting elected isn't the

419
00:13:06,686 --> 00:13:08,319
Harvard-Yale debate society

420
00:13:08,321 --> 00:13:09,454
where the best argument carries

421
00:13:09,456 --> 00:13:10,155
the day.

422
00:13:10,157 --> 00:13:11,122
These are steel cage

423
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:13,725
death matches.

424
00:13:13,727 --> 00:13:14,726
And even if you win-- which,

425
00:13:14,728 --> 00:13:16,361
with all due respect, would be

426
00:13:16,363 --> 00:13:17,929
laughable-- they will

427
00:13:17,931 --> 00:13:20,165
hobble you.

428
00:13:20,167 --> 00:13:22,600
They will shatter you.

429
00:13:22,602 --> 00:13:24,569
The process itself will change

430
00:13:24,571 --> 00:13:26,471
you in ways that you cannot even

431
00:13:26,473 --> 00:13:28,039
possibly imagine.

432
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:28,973
Is that what you want?

433
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:30,008
And is that what you want

434
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:31,276
for you, for your family?

435
00:13:31,278 --> 00:13:32,844
Do you have a family?

436
00:13:32,846 --> 00:13:33,511
- I'm a single mom.

437
00:13:33,513 --> 00:13:35,046
I have a six-year-old son.

438
00:13:35,048 --> 00:13:36,347
- What about the kid's dad?

439
00:13:36,349 --> 00:13:37,482
- Irrelevant.

440
00:13:37,484 --> 00:13:38,550
- Not if you're going

441
00:13:38,552 --> 00:13:39,584
to do this.

442
00:13:39,586 --> 00:13:41,419
Nothing will be irrelevant.

443
00:13:41,421 --> 00:13:42,821
Despite this being the bluest

444
00:13:42,823 --> 00:13:44,455
state in the country, it still

445
00:13:44,457 --> 00:13:46,057
knocked down gay marriage

446
00:13:46,059 --> 00:13:48,059
and the legalization of pot.

447
00:13:48,061 --> 00:13:49,327
Over half of the people in the

448
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:50,929
state self-identify as

449
00:13:50,931 --> 00:13:52,831
born-agains or regular church

450
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:54,999
goers-- not exactly the profile

451
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:56,201
of someone who's going to be

452
00:13:56,203 --> 00:13:57,836
voting for you.

453
00:13:57,838 --> 00:14:00,972
This is a blood sport, O.K.?

454
00:14:00,974 --> 00:14:02,473
I have worked for men who were

455
00:14:02,475 --> 00:14:04,676
shot at in Vietnam and the

456
00:14:04,678 --> 00:14:06,411
campaign literally broke them

457
00:14:06,413 --> 00:14:08,079
down to tears.

458
00:14:08,081 --> 00:14:10,114
A man I loved-- who America

459
00:14:10,116 --> 00:14:11,783
loved-- with the Navy cross and

460
00:14:11,785 --> 00:14:13,718
two purple hearts, sat crying on

461
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,687
my living room couch because of

462
00:14:15,689 --> 00:14:16,855
what the press said about him

463
00:14:16,857 --> 00:14:19,924
and his family.

464
00:14:19,926 --> 00:14:20,758
You're too good a person

465
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:23,761
for this.

466
00:14:23,763 --> 00:14:26,297
Look...

467
00:14:26,299 --> 00:14:29,767
To win in politics, you have got

468
00:14:29,769 --> 00:14:31,169
to be the person who's willing

469
00:14:31,171 --> 00:14:34,973
to bring a gun to a knife fight.

470
00:14:34,975 --> 00:14:37,242
- Is this your usual pep talk?

471
00:14:37,244 --> 00:14:38,343
- No.

472
00:14:38,345 --> 00:14:40,912
- Well, that's good, I guess.

473
00:14:40,914 --> 00:14:41,880
- No, this one's for friends

474
00:14:41,882 --> 00:14:44,315
and family-- usually it's worse.

475
00:14:44,317 --> 00:14:48,353
- Hmm.

476
00:14:48,355 --> 00:14:49,387
- She wants to be governor.

477
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:50,922
Oh, man.

478
00:14:50,924 --> 00:14:51,990
- I liked her.

479
00:14:51,992 --> 00:14:53,625
She was cool and sharp and

480
00:14:53,627 --> 00:14:54,392
seemed like she really

481
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:56,427
wanted it.

482
00:14:56,429 --> 00:14:57,262
- Well, I want to play

483
00:14:57,264 --> 00:14:58,863
shortstop for the giants,

484
00:14:58,865 --> 00:14:59,864
but it's not gonna happen in

485
00:14:59,866 --> 00:15:04,035
this lifetime.

486
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:06,871
...O.K.

487
00:15:06,873 --> 00:15:10,041
Jimmy, you want to start us off?

488
00:15:10,043 --> 00:15:10,875
- This is our friend tawny

489
00:15:10,877 --> 00:15:12,610
Shearson-- courtesy of YouTube--

490
00:15:12,612 --> 00:15:13,411
at her massage school

491
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:15,647
graduation picnic.

492
00:15:15,649 --> 00:15:16,781
- So she is an actual masseuse,

493
00:15:16,783 --> 00:15:18,383
this is not a set-up?

494
00:15:18,385 --> 00:15:19,350
- Licensed and with six years

495
00:15:19,352 --> 00:15:20,418
experience.

496
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:21,786
- Oh, that sucks.

497
00:15:21,788 --> 00:15:22,453
- But with other

498
00:15:22,455 --> 00:15:23,755
experience too.

499
00:15:23,757 --> 00:15:25,023
She had the misfortune of being

500
00:15:25,025 --> 00:15:27,558
arrested twice for prostitution.

501
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:28,793
The first time she pleaded

502
00:15:28,795 --> 00:15:29,827
guilty and was sentenced to

503
00:15:29,829 --> 00:15:30,995
probation, the other time,

504
00:15:30,997 --> 00:15:31,996
charges were dropped.

505
00:15:31,998 --> 00:15:33,031
- O.K., so we're not dealing

506
00:15:33,033 --> 00:15:34,599
with the virgin Mary here.

507
00:15:34,601 --> 00:15:36,601
- Exactly, and you, sir, are a

508
00:15:36,603 --> 00:15:38,102
war hero who served your country

509
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:39,237
in the freezing mountains of

510
00:15:39,239 --> 00:15:40,405
Afghanistan while she was

511
00:15:40,407 --> 00:15:41,606
selling her pussy at the Beverly

512
00:15:41,608 --> 00:15:43,007
hills hotel.

513
00:15:43,009 --> 00:15:44,008
So if it becomes her word

514
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:45,076
against yours, you should be

515
00:15:45,078 --> 00:15:47,178
O.K., that's the good news.

516
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:49,847
- O.K., tell me the bad news.

517
00:15:49,849 --> 00:15:51,816
- She's a pro and you're on her

518
00:15:51,818 --> 00:15:54,118
massage table in your boxers.

519
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,753
That's our bogey.

520
00:15:55,755 --> 00:15:56,587
- Do we know what she's

521
00:15:56,589 --> 00:15:57,255
asking for?

522
00:15:57,257 --> 00:15:58,222
- Two million.

523
00:15:58,224 --> 00:15:59,123
- Oh, forget that.

524
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:00,124
Jimmy, could you bring up the

525
00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:01,926
next thing?

526
00:16:01,928 --> 00:16:02,860
We just threw this together,

527
00:16:02,862 --> 00:16:03,995
probably a little early, but we

528
00:16:03,997 --> 00:16:05,196
had to know.

529
00:16:05,198 --> 00:16:06,364
You want to know why you're up

530
00:16:06,366 --> 00:16:07,031
seven points?

531
00:16:07,033 --> 00:16:07,732
This is why.

532
00:16:07,734 --> 00:16:09,434
Soccer moms, 35 to 45,

533
00:16:09,436 --> 00:16:10,835
these are your people.

534
00:16:10,837 --> 00:16:12,170
- No way would I

535
00:16:12,172 --> 00:16:13,638
believe him.

536
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:16,007
- And if she had a shady past

537
00:16:16,009 --> 00:16:18,209
and was a known and proven liar?

538
00:16:18,211 --> 00:16:19,444
- I don't know.

539
00:16:19,446 --> 00:16:21,112
Someone who looks like that?

540
00:16:21,114 --> 00:16:22,280
He's still a guy.

541
00:16:22,282 --> 00:16:23,081
- Guys do what they're

542
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:24,549
gonna do.

543
00:16:24,551 --> 00:16:25,650
- And how about if someone told

544
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:27,819
you that he was in a state of

545
00:16:27,821 --> 00:16:29,454
semi-consciousness because of

546
00:16:29,456 --> 00:16:31,522
all the pain, and that's why he

547
00:16:31,524 --> 00:16:32,623
didn't realize how bad it might

548
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:33,925
look, him being in there

549
00:16:33,927 --> 00:16:34,826
with her?

550
00:16:34,828 --> 00:16:35,860
- If my husband said something

551
00:16:35,862 --> 00:16:37,061
like that, not only would I

552
00:16:37,063 --> 00:16:38,529
think that he a cheating jerk,

553
00:16:38,531 --> 00:16:39,697
but that he can't make up a

554
00:16:39,699 --> 00:16:41,699
halfway decent lie.

555
00:16:41,701 --> 00:16:43,301
- O.K., they were my people.

556
00:16:43,303 --> 00:16:44,569
- If I told you that because of

557
00:16:44,571 --> 00:16:46,904
a war injury, sometimes he takes

558
00:16:46,906 --> 00:16:48,306
strong pain medication which

559
00:16:48,308 --> 00:16:49,707
makes him drowsy and that's why

560
00:16:49,709 --> 00:16:50,675
this happened?

561
00:16:50,677 --> 00:16:52,577
- Well, that's 10% better,

562
00:16:52,579 --> 00:16:55,480
but 90% pure lame-o.

563
00:16:55,482 --> 00:16:56,881
Come on.

564
00:16:56,883 --> 00:16:59,083
Really.

565
00:16:59,085 --> 00:16:59,917
- They love you when

566
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:00,651
you're talking about smaller

567
00:17:00,653 --> 00:17:02,020
class sizes, but not so much

568
00:17:02,022 --> 00:17:03,187
when you're trying to explain

569
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:05,023
away a quickie with tawny.

570
00:17:05,025 --> 00:17:06,457
- I am such an idiot.

571
00:17:06,459 --> 00:17:09,327
- You are anything but.

572
00:17:09,329 --> 00:17:10,495
But you got caught up in some

573
00:17:10,497 --> 00:17:11,462
nasty shit.

574
00:17:11,464 --> 00:17:12,630
We're going to figure out a way

575
00:17:12,632 --> 00:17:14,499
to get you out of it.

576
00:17:14,501 --> 00:17:15,500
- How is she going to

577
00:17:15,502 --> 00:17:16,167
spill it?

578
00:17:16,169 --> 00:17:17,001
- She's got some kinda in

579
00:17:17,003 --> 00:17:18,669
this asshole they brought in to

580
00:17:18,671 --> 00:17:20,104
run KXSF-- Roger Fillmore--

581
00:17:20,106 --> 00:17:20,972
he's practically smacking his

582
00:17:20,974 --> 00:17:22,140
lips on this one.

583
00:17:22,142 --> 00:17:23,141
Not to mention his riding-high

584
00:17:23,143 --> 00:17:24,242
tea party pals.

585
00:17:24,244 --> 00:17:25,543
This is their wet dream.

586
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:26,611
- So what are they waiting for?

587
00:17:26,613 --> 00:17:27,612
- She's teed it up, but hasn't

588
00:17:27,614 --> 00:17:29,280
given the deliverables.

589
00:17:29,282 --> 00:17:30,848
This is straight-up pay to play.

590
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:32,183
And even if we do pay, Roger is

591
00:17:32,185 --> 00:17:33,017
still probably going to run

592
00:17:33,019 --> 00:17:33,918
with it.

593
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:34,919
- O.K., look, we're going to

594
00:17:34,921 --> 00:17:36,254
figure out a way to inoculate

595
00:17:36,256 --> 00:17:37,655
you against this and we're going

596
00:17:37,657 --> 00:17:39,457
to dig up the shit on this girl.

597
00:17:39,459 --> 00:17:40,625
What do you think is the best

598
00:17:40,627 --> 00:17:43,828
- Carl Ludwig at KCOP loves us.

599
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:45,396
- Or Maggie Darcy?

600
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:47,331
- I have two words for you.

601
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:49,033
Peaches o'Dell.

602
00:18:00,914 --> 00:18:01,579
- Hey.

603
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:03,147
- Hey.

604
00:18:03,149 --> 00:18:04,982
- Can I buy you another coffee?

605
00:18:04,984 --> 00:18:06,017
- No thanks, I've got enough to

606
00:18:06,019 --> 00:18:07,785
last me all night which, at the

607
00:18:07,787 --> 00:18:08,686
rate you're dumping your garbage

608
00:18:08,688 --> 00:18:09,987
on me, is where I'm going

609
00:18:09,989 --> 00:18:10,888
to be again.

610
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:12,056
- You did a great job with that

611
00:18:12,058 --> 00:18:12,857
tawny mug shot.

612
00:18:12,859 --> 00:18:13,624
- She's a ho.

613
00:18:13,626 --> 00:18:14,659
- She's a ho with a story.

614
00:18:14,661 --> 00:18:15,960
- Yeah, well, like all of us.

615
00:18:15,962 --> 00:18:17,395
- How much did it cost you?

616
00:18:17,397 --> 00:18:18,830
- Nothing.

617
00:18:18,832 --> 00:18:19,997
I did a little thing for an

618
00:18:19,999 --> 00:18:22,567
interpol guy running a buttoncam

619
00:18:22,569 --> 00:18:24,302
video on a dot-com gazillionare.

620
00:18:24,304 --> 00:18:24,969
- A thing?

621
00:18:24,971 --> 00:18:25,703
- A thing.

622
00:18:25,705 --> 00:18:27,872
You don't wanna know, trust me.

623
00:18:27,874 --> 00:18:29,907
And... I got you a

624
00:18:29,909 --> 00:18:31,142
little present.

625
00:18:31,144 --> 00:18:31,976
- This wouldn't have anything

626
00:18:31,978 --> 00:18:33,277
to do with health-related

627
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:34,412
issues, would it?

628
00:18:34,414 --> 00:18:35,413
- Try everything.

629
00:18:35,415 --> 00:18:36,380
Your buddy in Kentucky--

630
00:18:36,382 --> 00:18:37,415
the ex-left fielder for the

631
00:18:37,417 --> 00:18:39,150
Baltimore orioles, no less--

632
00:18:39,152 --> 00:18:40,084
guess what?

633
00:18:40,086 --> 00:18:41,119
He's mortal.

634
00:18:41,121 --> 00:18:41,819
- I'm heartbroken.

635
00:18:41,821 --> 00:18:42,753
- Yeah, me too.

636
00:18:42,755 --> 00:18:43,621
Who would have thunk it?

637
00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:45,590
Leagues-while-you-were-a-pussy-

638
00:18:45,592 --> 00:18:46,858
in-the-peace-corp,

639
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:48,326
arrogant prick fuck.

640
00:18:48,328 --> 00:18:49,260
- And this is solid?

641
00:18:49,262 --> 00:18:50,361
- Platinum.

642
00:18:50,363 --> 00:18:51,162
- Actually seen,

643
00:18:51,164 --> 00:18:52,630
or talked about?

644
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:54,365
- What do you take me for?

645
00:18:54,367 --> 00:18:55,199
- As our friend the gipper

646
00:18:55,201 --> 00:18:55,867
always said,

647
00:18:55,869 --> 00:18:57,502
"doveryai, no proveryai."

648
00:18:57,504 --> 00:18:59,837
Trust, but verify.

649
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:00,805
- O.K.

650
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:04,075
Well, no pro-pro-pro--

651
00:19:04,077 --> 00:19:06,144
look at it.

652
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:13,117
- Wow.

653
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:14,018
- Yeah.

654
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:16,521
You can kiss me if you like.

655
00:19:16,523 --> 00:19:18,189
- Irregular heartbeat.

656
00:19:18,191 --> 00:19:19,857
He's had it for years.

657
00:19:19,859 --> 00:19:21,058
And one of the great truisms of

658
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:22,426
the game is when voters start to

659
00:19:22,428 --> 00:19:23,661
worry about a candidate's

660
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:24,495
health...

661
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:26,564
It is a gigantic numbers suck.

662
00:19:26,566 --> 00:19:28,399
But I can't exactly tell a local

663
00:19:28,401 --> 00:19:29,400
news honey I just happened to

664
00:19:29,402 --> 00:19:30,434
sneak a peek at Perkins'

665
00:19:30,436 --> 00:19:31,869
medical records.

666
00:19:31,871 --> 00:19:33,204
- Well, no, I mean,

667
00:19:33,206 --> 00:19:34,639
not like that.

668
00:19:34,641 --> 00:19:36,374
- How, then?

669
00:19:36,376 --> 00:19:37,375
- It's all about how you frame

670
00:19:37,377 --> 00:19:38,209
the narrative.

671
00:19:38,211 --> 00:19:39,877
Look, this is a race about

672
00:19:39,879 --> 00:19:40,912
leadership.

673
00:19:40,914 --> 00:19:42,380
One guy is using his position in

674
00:19:42,382 --> 00:19:43,447
the State Senate...

675
00:19:43,449 --> 00:19:44,515
To conduct a completely

676
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:46,083
meritless witch-hunt against

677
00:19:46,085 --> 00:19:47,318
a man who has served the public

678
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,753
his entire adult life, a man

679
00:19:48,755 --> 00:19:49,854
who works for the state of

680
00:19:49,856 --> 00:19:51,489
Kentucky 24/7.

681
00:19:51,491 --> 00:19:52,857
Look... look what time we're

682
00:19:52,859 --> 00:19:53,724
talking now.

683
00:19:53,726 --> 00:19:55,293
It's what, it's 3:15 in the

684
00:19:55,295 --> 00:19:56,561
morning your time.

685
00:19:56,563 --> 00:19:59,597
- Yeah.

686
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:01,499
- What you do...

687
00:20:01,501 --> 00:20:03,901
Is incredibly difficult.

688
00:20:03,903 --> 00:20:05,269
It requires tremendous strength

689
00:20:05,271 --> 00:20:06,304
and stamina.

690
00:20:06,306 --> 00:20:07,071
- Yeah, you're fucking

691
00:20:07,073 --> 00:20:08,072
telling me.

692
00:20:08,074 --> 00:20:08,873
Trying to get my

693
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:09,807
anti-foreclosure thing...

694
00:20:09,809 --> 00:20:10,608
Through this wing-nut

695
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:12,243
legislature is like trying to

696
00:20:12,245 --> 00:20:13,744
run a Red Sox flag up in

697
00:20:13,746 --> 00:20:15,246
yankee stadium.

698
00:20:15,248 --> 00:20:16,380
- How's it going?

699
00:20:16,382 --> 00:20:17,215
- Ah, you know, two steps

700
00:20:17,217 --> 00:20:19,116
forward, one-and-a-half back.

701
00:20:19,118 --> 00:20:20,284
And not to sound like some kinda

702
00:20:20,286 --> 00:20:21,452
ad you guys do, but my mama

703
00:20:21,454 --> 00:20:22,119
could've used something

704
00:20:22,121 --> 00:20:23,120
like this...

705
00:20:23,122 --> 00:20:24,121
And if these assholes want a

706
00:20:24,123 --> 00:20:24,956
fight, they're going to get

707
00:20:24,958 --> 00:20:26,057
a fight.

708
00:20:26,059 --> 00:20:26,791
- And it's an incredibly

709
00:20:26,793 --> 00:20:28,392
difficult fight, right?

710
00:20:28,394 --> 00:20:29,927
And look, all we're doing is

711
00:20:29,929 --> 00:20:31,395
asking the voters to compare the

712
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:33,164
two candidates' health records

713
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:35,566
and make an informed choice.

714
00:20:35,568 --> 00:20:36,567
I mean, you're going to release

715
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:37,935
everything you have, right?

716
00:20:37,937 --> 00:20:39,103
I mean, and is there anything in

717
00:20:39,105 --> 00:20:40,104
there that I need to be

718
00:20:40,106 --> 00:20:40,771
worried about?

719
00:20:40,773 --> 00:20:41,973
- Nothing.

720
00:20:41,975 --> 00:20:42,907
- Really nothing?

721
00:20:42,909 --> 00:20:43,774
- Trust me.

722
00:20:43,776 --> 00:20:45,009
Despite decades of avoiding the

723
00:20:45,011 --> 00:20:46,043
gym like that's where you get

724
00:20:46,045 --> 00:20:47,545
dengue fever, I have--

725
00:20:47,547 --> 00:20:50,481
probably unfairly-- been dealt a

726
00:20:50,483 --> 00:20:51,549
pretty good hand.

727
00:20:51,551 --> 00:20:52,717
- I'm going to have my guy look

728
00:20:52,719 --> 00:20:53,484
it over anyway.

729
00:20:53,486 --> 00:20:55,086
And then when we do release it,

730
00:20:55,088 --> 00:20:56,654
every day, at every stop through

731
00:20:56,656 --> 00:20:59,190
every news cycle, we hammer him

732
00:20:59,192 --> 00:21:00,825
to release his.

733
00:21:00,827 --> 00:21:02,360
- What if he doesn't go for it?

734
00:21:02,362 --> 00:21:03,027
- Well, that's exactly

735
00:21:03,029 --> 00:21:04,161
what we want.

736
00:21:04,163 --> 00:21:04,996
More than anything else,

737
00:21:04,998 --> 00:21:07,098
it's the refusal to release that

738
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:07,999
creates the story.

739
00:21:08,001 --> 00:21:09,233
Look...

740
00:21:09,235 --> 00:21:10,334
Campaigns always come down

741
00:21:10,336 --> 00:21:12,637
to one thing above all else:

742
00:21:12,639 --> 00:21:14,572
Who do you trust?

743
00:21:14,574 --> 00:21:16,374
And by not releasing,

744
00:21:16,376 --> 00:21:17,108
that causes people

745
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:18,476
to lose trust.

746
00:21:18,478 --> 00:21:19,477
And once you've lost the public

747
00:21:19,479 --> 00:21:20,778
trust, you're a dead

748
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:22,046
man walking.

749
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:24,081
- Better him than me.

750
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:24,749
- And that's just

751
00:21:24,751 --> 00:21:26,984
then we get some credible third

752
00:21:26,986 --> 00:21:28,185
parties down there to just

753
00:21:28,187 --> 00:21:29,620
pound him...

754
00:21:29,622 --> 00:21:30,454
Ask him, "has he ever

755
00:21:30,456 --> 00:21:32,757
failed a steroids tests?"

756
00:21:32,759 --> 00:21:34,392
You think Roger clemens on

757
00:21:34,394 --> 00:21:35,893
steroids was a big story?

758
00:21:35,895 --> 00:21:36,894
How about a guy running for

759
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:38,729
governor on the juice?

760
00:21:38,731 --> 00:21:39,864
And the nurses are with us...

761
00:21:39,866 --> 00:21:40,598
Big time.

762
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,932
We get them out there, picketing

763
00:21:41,934 --> 00:21:43,834
his fucking office every week

764
00:21:43,836 --> 00:21:45,469
and then we get our blog buddies

765
00:21:45,471 --> 00:21:47,071
to float a story that he may be

766
00:21:47,073 --> 00:21:48,572
suffering from some sort of

767
00:21:48,574 --> 00:21:50,908
S.T.D. And then we put the

768
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:51,909
flyers on the windshield at the

769
00:21:51,911 --> 00:21:53,377
churches and then we follow that

770
00:21:53,379 --> 00:21:55,913
up with a killer push poll.

771
00:21:55,915 --> 00:21:57,081
- Well, that's nice,

772
00:21:57,083 --> 00:21:57,982
considering he's got none of

773
00:21:57,984 --> 00:21:59,717
those things.

774
00:21:59,719 --> 00:22:00,818
- Well, maybe he has and maybe

775
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:02,987
he hasn't.

776
00:22:02,989 --> 00:22:05,056
We're just asking questions.

777
00:22:05,058 --> 00:22:07,525
Look, your guy loves to talk

778
00:22:07,527 --> 00:22:08,359
about hitting major league

779
00:22:08,361 --> 00:22:09,060
pitching?

780
00:22:09,062 --> 00:22:11,429
Well, politics is the N.F.L.

781
00:22:11,431 --> 00:22:12,296
And we're gonna hit him

782
00:22:12,298 --> 00:22:14,265
helmet to helmet.

783
00:22:14,267 --> 00:22:15,199
- Let's say he does release

784
00:22:15,201 --> 00:22:16,133
them and people feel sorry

785
00:22:16,135 --> 00:22:16,934
for him?

786
00:22:16,936 --> 00:22:18,102
Then I just look like some kind

787
00:22:18,104 --> 00:22:20,471
of a jerk for bringing it up.

788
00:22:20,473 --> 00:22:21,172
- You didn't know what

789
00:22:21,174 --> 00:22:21,839
was in it!

790
00:22:21,841 --> 00:22:22,506
You're as surprised as

791
00:22:22,508 --> 00:22:24,041
he was an all-star baseball

792
00:22:24,043 --> 00:22:25,710
player, for Christ's sake.

793
00:22:25,712 --> 00:22:28,279
Of course, you feel for him...

794
00:22:28,281 --> 00:22:29,780
And you'll keep him in yours and

795
00:22:29,782 --> 00:22:31,015
Sophia's prayers, but what

796
00:22:31,017 --> 00:22:32,183
you're more interested in

797
00:22:32,185 --> 00:22:33,384
is who's best qualified to lead

798
00:22:33,386 --> 00:22:34,618
a state that nobody could

799
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:36,020
possibly care about more

800
00:22:36,022 --> 00:22:36,987
than you.

801
00:22:36,989 --> 00:22:38,789
- Got it.

802
00:22:40,093 --> 00:22:43,227
Crazy times, man.

803
00:22:43,229 --> 00:22:44,395
Hey, is it true Stephen green

804
00:22:44,397 --> 00:22:46,764
got a hummer from a pro?

805
00:22:46,766 --> 00:22:48,332
- Where did you hear that?

806
00:22:48,334 --> 00:22:49,633
- I heard it.

807
00:22:49,635 --> 00:22:51,369
- Come on.

808
00:22:51,371 --> 00:22:52,370
- One of green's guys did the,

809
00:22:52,372 --> 00:22:53,671
uh, the webb race with

810
00:22:53,673 --> 00:22:54,839
one of mine.

811
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:57,808
That makes my stuff look

812
00:22:57,810 --> 00:23:01,112
like a walk in the park.

813
00:23:01,114 --> 00:23:03,481
Was she hot?

814
00:23:03,483 --> 00:23:04,849
- I can neither confirm nor

815
00:23:04,851 --> 00:23:06,717
deny the story.

816
00:23:06,719 --> 00:23:07,685
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

817
00:23:07,687 --> 00:23:08,619
Was she hot?

818
00:23:08,621 --> 00:23:09,754
- Allegedly, very.

819
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:21,265
...hey, peaches!

820
00:23:21,267 --> 00:23:23,667
- Really, you're coming to me?

821
00:23:23,669 --> 00:23:24,969
- Always. - Oh, come on.

822
00:23:24,971 --> 00:23:26,270
When I'm looking my worst?

823
00:23:26,272 --> 00:23:27,371
- Your worst is a thousand

824
00:23:27,373 --> 00:23:28,305
times better than most

825
00:23:28,307 --> 00:23:29,173
people's best.

826
00:23:29,175 --> 00:23:30,875
Weren't you a miss-something?

827
00:23:30,877 --> 00:23:31,809
Nebraska? - Arizona.

828
00:23:31,811 --> 00:23:33,210
- Arizona. - Miss Arizona.

829
00:23:33,212 --> 00:23:34,378
Some of us had to get ahead

830
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:35,780
without the fancy schools.

831
00:23:35,782 --> 00:23:37,047
- Hey, while you were polishing

832
00:23:37,049 --> 00:23:38,649
your tiara, I was busting my ass

833
00:23:38,651 --> 00:23:39,617
on construction sites up

834
00:23:39,619 --> 00:23:40,451
in Minnesota.

835
00:23:40,453 --> 00:23:41,952
- Oh, please.

836
00:23:41,954 --> 00:23:43,087
Didn't you go to Harvard law

837
00:23:43,089 --> 00:23:44,488
or something?

838
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:45,756
Sounds kind of silver-spoony

839
00:23:45,758 --> 00:23:46,424
to me.

840
00:23:46,426 --> 00:23:47,191
- Try wooden spoon.

841
00:23:47,193 --> 00:23:48,359
My dad was a building trades

842
00:23:48,361 --> 00:23:49,627
union steward.

843
00:23:49,629 --> 00:23:50,795
That's how I got all my cushy

844
00:23:50,797 --> 00:23:51,629
jobs lugging lumber up four

845
00:23:51,631 --> 00:23:53,230
flights of stairs.

846
00:23:53,232 --> 00:23:54,131
- Well, you've got me without

847
00:23:54,133 --> 00:23:56,000
the glam, and as much as I do

848
00:23:56,002 --> 00:23:57,935
enjoy seeing you, I don't think

849
00:23:57,937 --> 00:23:59,103
you came all the way across town

850
00:23:59,105 --> 00:24:00,104
to check me out in my

851
00:24:00,106 --> 00:24:00,838
sweaty gear.

852
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:01,872
- I have a story for you.

853
00:24:01,874 --> 00:24:02,840
- Oh, stop it.

854
00:24:02,842 --> 00:24:04,041
- I hear that CNN may be

855
00:24:04,043 --> 00:24:05,976
bringing you to D.C. to try you

856
00:24:05,978 --> 00:24:07,511
out nationally?

857
00:24:07,513 --> 00:24:08,479
- Well, it could be.

858
00:24:08,481 --> 00:24:09,947
- Well, this could help.

859
00:24:09,949 --> 00:24:11,015
- Paul, whatever you've got for

860
00:24:11,017 --> 00:24:12,416
me, it cannot be as good as what

861
00:24:12,418 --> 00:24:13,217
I'm getting from Campbell's

862
00:24:13,219 --> 00:24:15,686
guys which, as I understand it,

863
00:24:15,688 --> 00:24:17,488
involves a tasty treat from a

864
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:19,857
smokin' hot masseuse.

865
00:24:19,859 --> 00:24:20,858
- Well, peaches, of course

866
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:22,026
we're gonna deny that.

867
00:24:22,028 --> 00:24:23,694
- We are talking about a united

868
00:24:23,696 --> 00:24:24,528
states senator and a purple

869
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:26,263
heart winner with a documented

870
00:24:26,265 --> 00:24:27,765
history of a bad back--

871
00:24:27,767 --> 00:24:29,366
injured, I might add, in service

872
00:24:29,368 --> 00:24:30,634
of this country.

873
00:24:30,636 --> 00:24:32,036
- Right, and John F. Kennedy

874
00:24:32,038 --> 00:24:33,204
had a bad back, but it didn't

875
00:24:33,206 --> 00:24:33,871
stop him from fucking

876
00:24:33,873 --> 00:24:34,538
Marilyn Monroe.

877
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:35,339
- This is no Marilyn.

878
00:24:35,341 --> 00:24:37,141
- No, Marilyn was a secret.

879
00:24:37,143 --> 00:24:38,476
And not this baby.

880
00:24:38,478 --> 00:24:39,543
She is hot and she is

881
00:24:39,545 --> 00:24:40,978
mine-o-mine.

882
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:41,812
- O.K., look.

883
00:24:41,814 --> 00:24:44,148
Like everything else,

884
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:46,217
there's another side to this.

885
00:24:46,219 --> 00:24:47,618
And I thought that you and I

886
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:48,452
might be able to work

887
00:24:48,454 --> 00:24:49,386
something out.

888
00:24:49,388 --> 00:24:51,121
- Hmm.

889
00:24:51,123 --> 00:24:52,389
Not friggin' likely.

890
00:24:52,391 --> 00:24:54,725
- O.K. - What?

891
00:24:54,727 --> 00:24:56,393
- I have a friend, who tells me

892
00:24:56,395 --> 00:24:58,329
that your newest anchor Connie

893
00:24:58,331 --> 00:24:59,663
Connor went to a bachelorette

894
00:24:59,665 --> 00:25:02,266
party in Vegas a few years back.

895
00:25:02,268 --> 00:25:04,602
- And?

896
00:25:04,604 --> 00:25:06,237
- Things got pretty wild.

897
00:25:08,808 --> 00:25:11,242
- Oh, yeah!

898
00:25:11,244 --> 00:25:11,976
O.K.

899
00:25:11,978 --> 00:25:14,044
O.K., your friends are good.

900
00:25:14,046 --> 00:25:15,646
These on the net?

901
00:25:15,648 --> 00:25:16,847
- Not yet.

902
00:25:16,849 --> 00:25:22,186
So... some room service?

903
00:25:22,188 --> 00:25:24,255
- Mmm.

904
00:25:24,257 --> 00:25:25,489
- Am I going to love this?

905
00:25:25,491 --> 00:25:26,357
- Do you love me?

906
00:25:26,359 --> 00:25:27,057
- Deeply.

907
00:25:27,059 --> 00:25:29,527
No, show me the spot first.

908
00:25:29,529 --> 00:25:30,528
- I used to

909
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:32,563
on a mission in Afghanistan,

910
00:25:32,565 --> 00:25:35,032
my helicopter was shot down.

911
00:25:35,034 --> 00:25:36,300
Both of my legs and four ribs

912
00:25:36,302 --> 00:25:38,168
were broken.

913
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:40,504
The enemy came to finish us off,

914
00:25:40,506 --> 00:25:41,705
but the young officer that I was

915
00:25:41,707 --> 00:25:43,240
transporting single-handedly

916
00:25:43,242 --> 00:25:44,575
fought off an entire squad of

917
00:25:44,577 --> 00:25:45,976
Taliban until reinforcements

918
00:25:45,978 --> 00:25:47,778
could arrive.

919
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:48,779
I didn't think I'd make it

920
00:25:48,781 --> 00:25:50,347
through that night.

921
00:25:50,349 --> 00:25:51,215
And when the rescue choppers

922
00:25:51,217 --> 00:25:53,751
finally came, that same officer

923
00:25:53,753 --> 00:25:55,386
carried me over a quarter mile

924
00:25:55,388 --> 00:25:57,254
on his back.

925
00:25:57,256 --> 00:25:57,922
By all accounts,

926
00:25:57,924 --> 00:25:59,657
I should be dead.

927
00:25:59,659 --> 00:26:02,459
But I'm not, thanks to one man.

928
00:26:02,461 --> 00:26:03,627
Stephen green fought for me with

929
00:26:03,629 --> 00:26:05,329
everything he had.

930
00:26:05,331 --> 00:26:06,330
And now he's fighting just as

931
00:26:06,332 --> 00:26:07,531
hard for all of California's

932
00:26:07,533 --> 00:26:09,767
families.

933
00:26:09,769 --> 00:26:10,768
<i-> I was so very proud

934
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:11,835
<i>to serve with captain Johnny</i>

935
00:26:11,837 --> 00:26:15,139
<i>Duncan-- a true American hero.</i>

936
00:26:15,141 --> 00:26:16,040
<i>I'm Stephen green and I</i>

937
00:26:16,042 --> 00:26:17,508
<i>approve this message.</i>

938
00:26:26,986 --> 00:26:28,552
- Yeah, it's for that

939
00:26:28,554 --> 00:26:29,820
new cruiser, which costs more

940
00:26:29,822 --> 00:26:31,155
than an aircraft carrier did

941
00:26:31,157 --> 00:26:32,423
when I was coming up.

942
00:26:32,425 --> 00:26:33,290
- Well, somebody will get rich

943
00:26:33,292 --> 00:26:34,325
on it.

944
00:26:34,327 --> 00:26:35,326
- Yeah, you know, I got a

945
00:26:35,328 --> 00:26:36,493
feeling it doesn't even do what

946
00:26:36,495 --> 00:26:38,462
the uh, Navy says it's supposed

947
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:39,964
to do, but you try to find real

948
00:26:39,966 --> 00:26:40,898
data on it?

949
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:41,999
I mean, good luck.

950
00:26:42,001 --> 00:26:43,801
Thank you.

951
00:26:43,803 --> 00:26:49,907
- You have a call to make.

952
00:26:49,909 --> 00:26:51,508
Mandy Denton.

953
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:52,977
- Sounds vaguely familiar.

954
00:26:52,979 --> 00:26:53,677
- She runs commercials

955
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:54,912
for Campbell.

956
00:26:54,914 --> 00:26:55,913
- Oh, God.

957
00:26:55,915 --> 00:26:58,115
Those cloying, what, "I believe

958
00:26:58,117 --> 00:27:00,084
how a guy treats his family,"

959
00:27:00,086 --> 00:27:01,585
those "Mr. family values till

960
00:27:01,587 --> 00:27:02,920
you want to retch," those ads?

961
00:27:02,922 --> 00:27:05,289
- Yeah, that's her.

962
00:27:05,291 --> 00:27:09,994
- Good night.

963
00:27:09,996 --> 00:27:10,828
- You know what they're doing,

964
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:12,162
right?

965
00:27:12,164 --> 00:27:13,263
The more they pound family

966
00:27:13,265 --> 00:27:14,498
values, they're just laying

967
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:17,534
track for you-know-who.

968
00:27:17,536 --> 00:27:18,936
- Scum.

969
00:27:18,938 --> 00:27:22,006
- First class.

970
00:27:22,008 --> 00:27:23,240
But it turns out that Mandy

971
00:27:23,242 --> 00:27:24,808
not only makes the commercials

972
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:25,909
for Campbell, she also makes

973
00:27:25,911 --> 00:27:27,845
his bed.

974
00:27:27,847 --> 00:27:29,980
It's all one big happy family--

975
00:27:29,982 --> 00:27:31,115
along with Roger Fillmore,

976
00:27:31,117 --> 00:27:33,584
down at KXSF-- but he's really

977
00:27:33,586 --> 00:27:35,786
just a mouthpiece for Campbell

978
00:27:35,788 --> 00:27:36,820
and his 90 million bucks he's

979
00:27:36,822 --> 00:27:39,723
got earmarked to bury you.

980
00:27:39,725 --> 00:27:41,925
- Yeah, family values.

981
00:27:41,927 --> 00:27:43,761
What's Roger actually got?

982
00:27:43,763 --> 00:27:45,396
- He's trying to swiftboat you.

983
00:27:45,398 --> 00:27:46,397
He's got all his guys meeting

984
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:47,398
with anybody and everybody you

985
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,699
ever served with.

986
00:27:48,701 --> 00:27:51,669
- Yeah? Happy hunting.

987
00:27:51,671 --> 00:27:53,637
What's Mandy's story?

988
00:27:53,639 --> 00:27:55,673
- She's good at what she does.

989
00:27:55,675 --> 00:27:57,107
She's got two kids at home,

990
00:27:57,109 --> 00:27:59,376
the husband's a dot-com guy.

991
00:27:59,378 --> 00:28:01,745
I don't think he knows.

992
00:28:01,747 --> 00:28:04,548
So...

993
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:05,849
- O.K., Roger?

994
00:28:05,851 --> 00:28:06,850
I want you to blow that

995
00:28:06,852 --> 00:28:07,685
asshole up.

996
00:28:07,687 --> 00:28:09,520
This Mandy thing, kill it.

997
00:28:09,522 --> 00:28:11,889
She's a civilian.

998
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:16,260
- What is it?

999
00:28:16,262 --> 00:28:17,194
- Talking points for the

1000
00:28:17,196 --> 00:28:18,529
governor on his budget.

1001
00:28:18,531 --> 00:28:19,396
- And what do you know

1002
00:28:19,398 --> 00:28:20,698
about that?

1003
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:23,634
- Six weeks ago, not much.

1004
00:28:23,636 --> 00:28:25,436
- O.K., but you can fake it.

1005
00:28:25,438 --> 00:28:26,970
- Yeah, it's nothing.

1006
00:28:26,972 --> 00:28:27,971
My parents think that I'm taking

1007
00:28:27,973 --> 00:28:29,173
some time off before applying to

1008
00:28:29,175 --> 00:28:30,240
med school.

1009
00:28:30,242 --> 00:28:31,608
And remember, you're not

1010
00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:35,245
Samantha, but a guy named Sam.

1011
00:28:35,247 --> 00:28:36,313
- Oh, thanks.

1012
00:28:36,315 --> 00:28:37,281
- You're welcome.

1013
00:28:39,585 --> 00:28:40,651
Don't be pissed.

1014
00:28:40,653 --> 00:28:42,453
- Oh, my God.

1015
00:28:42,455 --> 00:28:43,554
- Hey, Paul.

1016
00:28:43,556 --> 00:28:45,189
- Hey, it's not too late

1017
00:28:45,191 --> 00:28:46,290
to call you, is it?

1018
00:28:46,292 --> 00:28:49,293
- Ah, no.

1019
00:28:49,295 --> 00:28:50,194
- Do you remember the, uh...

1020
00:28:50,196 --> 00:28:51,361
- Hi, Paul.

1021
00:28:51,363 --> 00:28:52,162
- ...football player who was

1022
00:28:52,164 --> 00:28:52,996
wanting to run for mayor

1023
00:28:52,998 --> 00:28:54,398
of San Diego?

1024
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,699
- Tony Blanchard.

1025
00:28:55,701 --> 00:28:56,467
- Right, right...

1026
00:28:56,469 --> 00:28:58,001
Right, and doesn't he have a

1027
00:28:58,003 --> 00:28:59,303
book coming out?

1028
00:28:59,305 --> 00:29:00,137
<i-> First and goal,

1029
00:29:00,139 --> 00:29:02,272
something like that.

1030
00:29:02,274 --> 00:29:03,741
- Let's get him in here.

1031
00:29:03,743 --> 00:29:04,942
- O.K.

1032
00:29:20,458 --> 00:29:23,794
- O.K., so, ah, 89.

1033
00:29:23,796 --> 00:29:25,229
You wanna push it?

1034
00:29:25,231 --> 00:29:27,664
8-9, perfect.

1035
00:29:27,666 --> 00:29:29,600
Thank you.

1036
00:29:32,972 --> 00:29:34,471
Hmm.

1037
00:29:41,913 --> 00:29:44,948
You and me, lunch.

1038
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:46,083
- O.K.

1039
00:29:46,085 --> 00:29:47,451
- Want pizza, yeah? O.K.

1040
00:29:51,524 --> 00:29:52,689
We're going to have to wait just

1041
00:29:52,691 --> 00:29:53,357
a second, honey.

1042
00:29:53,359 --> 00:29:55,292
Come on.

1043
00:29:55,294 --> 00:29:56,393
Hello.

1044
00:29:56,395 --> 00:29:57,427
Hey, guys.

1045
00:29:57,429 --> 00:29:59,329
...petitions from people who

1046
00:29:59,331 --> 00:30:02,099
want me to run.

1047
00:30:02,101 --> 00:30:03,100
- Did you have every junkie in

1048
00:30:03,102 --> 00:30:04,468
the mission sign these?

1049
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:05,502
- No.

1050
00:30:05,504 --> 00:30:06,436
O.K., yes.

1051
00:30:06,438 --> 00:30:07,437
But I also got

1052
00:30:07,439 --> 00:30:08,939
architects, other physicians,

1053
00:30:08,941 --> 00:30:10,374
waitresses, delivery guys,

1054
00:30:10,376 --> 00:30:11,875
teachers, painters.

1055
00:30:11,877 --> 00:30:13,043
- O.K., look, I have no doubt

1056
00:30:13,045 --> 00:30:14,878
those people love you.

1057
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,280
But you also need the farmers in

1058
00:30:16,282 --> 00:30:17,414
the central valley, the soccer

1059
00:30:17,416 --> 00:30:19,116
moms in Concord and the second

1060
00:30:19,118 --> 00:30:20,350
and third generation latinos in

1061
00:30:20,352 --> 00:30:22,252
San Bernardino to love you too.

1062
00:30:22,254 --> 00:30:23,987
Not to mention the golf crowd in

1063
00:30:23,989 --> 00:30:24,655
Santa Barbara.

1064
00:30:24,657 --> 00:30:25,489
- Hey, I was raised in

1065
00:30:25,491 --> 00:30:26,390
Santa Barbara.

1066
00:30:26,392 --> 00:30:27,391
My dad was a doctor there

1067
00:30:27,393 --> 00:30:29,393
- O.K., well, great, but that's

1068
00:30:29,395 --> 00:30:30,394
not gonna help you with your

1069
00:30:30,396 --> 00:30:31,862
druggy friends.

1070
00:30:31,864 --> 00:30:33,030
And then the other side of that,

1071
00:30:33,032 --> 00:30:33,931
your parents' friends don't want

1072
00:30:33,933 --> 00:30:34,765
to know about the dirty

1073
00:30:34,767 --> 00:30:35,799
needle crowd.

1074
00:30:35,801 --> 00:30:37,467
And here's the cold reality:

1075
00:30:37,469 --> 00:30:39,636
You have no name recognition.

1076
00:30:39,638 --> 00:30:40,804
So how the hell are you going

1077
00:30:40,806 --> 00:30:42,706
- that's what the web's for.

1078
00:30:42,708 --> 00:30:44,308
There has to be a million people

1079
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:45,576
willing to pay $10 for

1080
00:30:45,578 --> 00:30:46,643
real change.

1081
00:30:46,645 --> 00:30:48,278
Boom-- there's $10 million

1082
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:49,279
for you.

1083
00:30:49,281 --> 00:30:50,247
- California has more local

1084
00:30:50,249 --> 00:30:51,348
media markets than any state

1085
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:52,316
in the union.

1086
00:30:52,318 --> 00:30:55,219
It costs $2.5 million a week for

1087
00:30:55,221 --> 00:30:56,720
a statewide media buy.

1088
00:30:56,722 --> 00:30:57,988
$10 million?

1089
00:30:57,990 --> 00:30:59,523
Try multiplying that by five

1090
00:30:59,525 --> 00:31:00,524
just to get into the game.

1091
00:31:00,526 --> 00:31:01,525
- O.K., then I'll get four

1092
00:31:01,527 --> 00:31:03,460
that's only 10% of the state to

1093
00:31:03,462 --> 00:31:04,795
pay $10.

1094
00:31:04,797 --> 00:31:06,296
You got 40.

1095
00:31:06,298 --> 00:31:07,297
You know, I gotta, I gotta

1096
00:31:07,299 --> 00:31:09,666
believe that one in 10 people

1097
00:31:09,668 --> 00:31:10,767
will think for the price of

1098
00:31:10,769 --> 00:31:11,735
two frappuccinos,

1099
00:31:11,737 --> 00:31:13,370
they'll finally get a governor

1100
00:31:13,372 --> 00:31:14,838
who will really change things.

1101
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,273
- O.K., I get it.

1102
00:31:16,275 --> 00:31:17,507
I'm sure you would be a

1103
00:31:17,509 --> 00:31:19,309
great governor.

1104
00:31:19,311 --> 00:31:20,244
But I'm in the business

1105
00:31:20,246 --> 00:31:21,511
of winning.

1106
00:31:21,513 --> 00:31:22,512
- I thought you were in the

1107
00:31:22,514 --> 00:31:23,614
business of helping.

1108
00:31:23,616 --> 00:31:25,115
- Helping people who can win.

1109
00:31:26,418 --> 00:31:27,584
- Hello?

1110
00:31:27,586 --> 00:31:29,086
- Would you just, would you,

1111
00:31:29,088 --> 00:31:30,587
would you just help me?

1112
00:31:30,589 --> 00:31:31,421
Would you, would you think

1113
00:31:31,423 --> 00:31:32,923
about it?

1114
00:31:32,925 --> 00:31:33,957
- Kentucky.

1115
00:31:33,959 --> 00:31:35,359
He loved the talking points.

1116
00:31:35,361 --> 00:31:37,995
- I have thought about it.

1117
00:31:37,997 --> 00:31:41,031
I'm sorry.

1118
00:31:41,033 --> 00:31:42,399
Hey, hey... no.

1119
00:31:42,401 --> 00:31:43,567
- Come on, buddy, we gotta go.

1120
00:31:43,569 --> 00:31:44,568
- For a girl born in seoul,

1121
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:45,736
she's sure got that Kentucky

1122
00:31:45,738 --> 00:31:47,437
thing down... - Thank you.

1123
00:31:47,439 --> 00:31:50,173
- Right?

1124
00:31:50,175 --> 00:31:51,341
I think it's going to move the

1125
00:31:51,343 --> 00:31:52,809
numbers... a little.

1126
00:31:52,811 --> 00:31:54,912
- Gimme a break!

1127
00:31:54,914 --> 00:31:56,546
- What?

1128
00:31:56,548 --> 00:31:57,381
- Look.

1129
00:31:57,383 --> 00:31:58,181
- I played professional

1130
00:31:58,183 --> 00:32:00,050
baseball for 15 years and was

1131
00:32:00,052 --> 00:32:01,184
fortunate enough to make the

1132
00:32:01,186 --> 00:32:02,519
American league all-star team

1133
00:32:02,521 --> 00:32:04,655
six times and later, I shared in

1134
00:32:04,657 --> 00:32:05,889
the highest honor in team

1135
00:32:05,891 --> 00:32:07,024
sports-- winning the

1136
00:32:07,026 --> 00:32:08,392
world series.

1137
00:32:08,394 --> 00:32:09,726
And after that amazing season,

1138
00:32:09,728 --> 00:32:10,994
I came home to serve in our

1139
00:32:10,996 --> 00:32:12,496
State Senate, where I stood up

1140
00:32:12,498 --> 00:32:13,864
for small businesses,

1141
00:32:13,866 --> 00:32:15,532
cutting your taxes and cracking

1142
00:32:15,534 --> 00:32:17,100
down on bloated pensions for

1143
00:32:17,102 --> 00:32:18,602
overpaid and underworked

1144
00:32:18,604 --> 00:32:19,937
bureaucrats.

1145
00:32:19,939 --> 00:32:21,004
But the greatest honor I could

1146
00:32:21,006 --> 00:32:23,040
ever have is going to bat for

1147
00:32:23,042 --> 00:32:24,675
all of Kentucky as your

1148
00:32:24,677 --> 00:32:26,109
governor.

1149
00:32:26,111 --> 00:32:27,244
I'm Justin Perkins,

1150
00:32:27,246 --> 00:32:29,613
and I approve this message.

1151
00:32:29,615 --> 00:32:32,015
- Oy.

1152
00:32:32,017 --> 00:32:33,917
- Yeah, right?

1153
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:35,252
- Now, I don't have an F.B.I.

1154
00:32:35,254 --> 00:32:37,154
Badge, but I know blackmail when

1155
00:32:37,156 --> 00:32:38,288
I see it.

1156
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:39,122
- As I'm sure you can

1157
00:32:39,124 --> 00:32:41,024
understand, we see it rather

1158
00:32:41,026 --> 00:32:42,125
differently.

1159
00:32:42,127 --> 00:32:43,794
My client has suffered enormous

1160
00:32:43,796 --> 00:32:46,697
emotional damage.

1161
00:32:46,699 --> 00:32:48,231
Imagine, you're hired to do a

1162
00:32:48,233 --> 00:32:50,267
job, you do it exceptionally

1163
00:32:50,269 --> 00:32:51,969
well for six years,

1164
00:32:51,971 --> 00:32:53,770
then suddenly out of the blue,

1165
00:32:53,772 --> 00:32:56,239
you're hit on by a united

1166
00:32:56,241 --> 00:32:57,941
states senator.

1167
00:32:57,943 --> 00:32:58,775
- Senator green has a

1168
00:32:58,777 --> 00:32:59,943
completely different

1169
00:32:59,945 --> 00:33:02,179
recollection of these events and

1170
00:33:02,181 --> 00:33:03,647
with all due respect,

1171
00:33:03,649 --> 00:33:04,815
if it comes down to his word

1172
00:33:04,817 --> 00:33:06,817
against your client's,

1173
00:33:06,819 --> 00:33:08,185
I think we both know who wins.

1174
00:33:08,187 --> 00:33:09,286
- You're a bit overconfident.

1175
00:33:09,288 --> 00:33:11,588
Do you have any idea what faces

1176
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:14,391
your boss if he doesn't settle

1177
00:33:14,393 --> 00:33:15,759
this case?

1178
00:33:15,761 --> 00:33:17,995
A legal colonoscopy without

1179
00:33:17,997 --> 00:33:19,830
anesthesia.

1180
00:33:19,832 --> 00:33:22,733
- O.K., I want to know

1181
00:33:22,735 --> 00:33:25,369
what you want.

1182
00:33:25,371 --> 00:33:26,503
- Finally!

1183
00:33:26,505 --> 00:33:27,804
What I want is a check--

1184
00:33:27,806 --> 00:33:29,439
- sweetheart, please.

1185
00:33:29,441 --> 00:33:31,008
Let me handle this.

1186
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:32,576
What Ms. Shearson wants is three

1187
00:33:32,578 --> 00:33:36,847
things: $3 million.

1188
00:33:36,849 --> 00:33:37,681
What your clients wants--

1189
00:33:37,683 --> 00:33:39,016
- wasn't it two million?

1190
00:33:39,018 --> 00:33:42,519
- It was two, until your boss

1191
00:33:42,521 --> 00:33:45,288
accused my client of extortion--

1192
00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:48,025
a million dollar costly mistake.

1193
00:33:48,027 --> 00:33:49,826
- Look, even if we were to pay

1194
00:33:49,828 --> 00:33:51,261
that outrageous amount,

1195
00:33:51,263 --> 00:33:52,896
what guarantee do we have that

1196
00:33:52,898 --> 00:33:53,897
we still wouldn't hear this

1197
00:33:53,899 --> 00:33:56,400
story from peaches o'Dell or any

1198
00:33:56,402 --> 00:33:58,001
of your other media buddies?

1199
00:33:58,003 --> 00:34:01,038
- Paul, I keep my promises.

1200
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,205
How do you think I built this

1201
00:34:02,207 --> 00:34:03,940
law firm?

1202
00:34:03,942 --> 00:34:07,110
- O.K.

1203
00:34:07,112 --> 00:34:10,113
All right.

1204
00:34:10,115 --> 00:34:10,981
This is what I'm prepared

1205
00:34:10,983 --> 00:34:13,917
to offer you.

1206
00:34:13,919 --> 00:34:15,085
And I really want you to think

1207
00:34:15,087 --> 00:34:16,953
because this is as high as it

1208
00:34:16,955 --> 00:34:21,858
will ever get.

1209
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:26,696
Zero.

1210
00:34:26,698 --> 00:34:28,598
That's my offer.

1211
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:29,933
- Well, I guess we're going to

1212
00:34:29,935 --> 00:34:31,468
be hearing a lot more about a

1213
00:34:31,470 --> 00:34:32,903
particular senator.

1214
00:34:32,905 --> 00:34:33,904
Now, Paul, I want you to

1215
00:34:33,906 --> 00:34:35,105
understand this is not a threat.

1216
00:34:35,107 --> 00:34:36,973
- You don't have much to go on.

1217
00:34:36,975 --> 00:34:38,542
On our side: A sterling silver

1218
00:34:38,544 --> 00:34:39,743
reputation.

1219
00:34:39,745 --> 00:34:41,611
Your side: Multiple prostitution

1220
00:34:41,613 --> 00:34:42,779
arrests.

1221
00:34:42,781 --> 00:34:45,916
But we have something that you

1222
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:48,318
don't have.

1223
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,320
We have a lab report

1224
00:34:50,322 --> 00:34:52,255
from a forensic lab in

1225
00:34:52,257 --> 00:34:53,757
Mountain view.

1226
00:34:53,759 --> 00:34:56,159
It shows tawny's shirt.

1227
00:34:56,161 --> 00:34:56,827
- You want to guess

1228
00:34:56,829 --> 00:35:00,397
what's on it?

1229
00:35:00,399 --> 00:35:02,899
- I don't think I want to.

1230
00:35:02,901 --> 00:35:05,869
- D.N.A., in a stain,

1231
00:35:05,871 --> 00:35:08,538
perfect match to your senator.

1232
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:10,674
It seems as if your guy is being

1233
00:35:10,676 --> 00:35:12,476
screwed again.

1234
00:35:12,478 --> 00:35:15,178
Mr. green, in the bedroom,

1235
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:17,481
with his happy little gun.

1236
00:35:21,919 --> 00:35:24,387
- Why did he do it?

1237
00:35:24,389 --> 00:35:27,157
- Look, politicians are

1238
00:35:27,159 --> 00:35:28,525
politicians because they have

1239
00:35:28,527 --> 00:35:30,060
completely interrelated

1240
00:35:30,062 --> 00:35:32,129
strengths and frailties.

1241
00:35:32,131 --> 00:35:33,630
They can be incredibly committed

1242
00:35:33,632 --> 00:35:35,432
to truly changing the world and

1243
00:35:35,434 --> 00:35:37,934
also be wildly self-destructive.

1244
00:35:37,936 --> 00:35:38,935
- I'll take the first and pass

1245
00:35:38,937 --> 00:35:40,170
on the second.

1246
00:35:40,172 --> 00:35:41,705
- It's not so easy in

1247
00:35:41,707 --> 00:35:43,340
the real world.

1248
00:35:43,342 --> 00:35:44,908
The qualities that make a star

1249
00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:47,244
politician-- the need for the

1250
00:35:47,246 --> 00:35:50,013
spotlight, the quest for power,

1251
00:35:50,015 --> 00:35:51,414
the ability to use people then

1252
00:35:51,416 --> 00:35:52,716
discard them when you're through

1253
00:35:52,718 --> 00:35:54,217
with them-- is the exact same

1254
00:35:54,219 --> 00:35:55,852
skill set that enables an

1255
00:35:55,854 --> 00:35:58,155
FDR to create the new deal.

1256
00:35:58,157 --> 00:35:59,723
Saving the country and having

1257
00:35:59,725 --> 00:36:00,991
multiple affairs.

1258
00:36:00,993 --> 00:36:02,392
Or eisenhower, liberate a

1259
00:36:02,394 --> 00:36:04,194
continent and be carrying on an

1260
00:36:04,196 --> 00:36:05,362
affair with his aide the

1261
00:36:05,364 --> 00:36:07,697
or president Clinton presiding

1262
00:36:07,699 --> 00:36:09,466
over an unprecedented period of

1263
00:36:09,468 --> 00:36:11,101
peace and prosperity and then

1264
00:36:11,103 --> 00:36:13,436
banging Monica Lewinsky.

1265
00:36:13,438 --> 00:36:14,804
- To all of our detriment.

1266
00:36:14,806 --> 00:36:15,972
But is this that we gotta have

1267
00:36:15,974 --> 00:36:16,806
or just something that we've

1268
00:36:16,808 --> 00:36:18,308
just bought into?

1269
00:36:18,310 --> 00:36:19,142
- You don't get the outsized

1270
00:36:19,144 --> 00:36:20,043
talent without the outsized

1271
00:36:20,045 --> 00:36:22,245
weakness.

1272
00:36:22,247 --> 00:36:23,246
And look, this isn't a video

1273
00:36:23,248 --> 00:36:24,181
game or a TV show.

1274
00:36:24,183 --> 00:36:25,615
This is the real thing.

1275
00:36:25,617 --> 00:36:27,717
People in power truly impact

1276
00:36:27,719 --> 00:36:29,119
our lives.

1277
00:36:29,121 --> 00:36:31,488
You know, do they screw up?

1278
00:36:31,490 --> 00:36:32,355
Are they perfect?

1279
00:36:32,357 --> 00:36:33,356
Look.

1280
00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:34,191
Stephen green could be

1281
00:36:34,193 --> 00:36:35,825
president, right?

1282
00:36:35,827 --> 00:36:38,361
And he would be a great one.

1283
00:36:38,363 --> 00:36:39,529
Because of some blackmailing

1284
00:36:39,531 --> 00:36:41,198
hooker, are we going to throw

1285
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,499
away all of the good that he's

1286
00:36:42,501 --> 00:36:43,700
done, all of the good that he's

1287
00:36:43,702 --> 00:36:45,569
gonna do?

1288
00:36:45,571 --> 00:36:47,070
- Yeah, but still.

1289
00:36:47,072 --> 00:36:48,071
- When it gets like this,

1290
00:36:48,073 --> 00:36:49,072
you just gotta get revved and

1291
00:36:49,074 --> 00:36:54,978
ready and say: W.W.M.D.

1292
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:56,513
What would machiavelli do?

1293
00:37:06,258 --> 00:37:07,857
- This better work, man.

1294
00:37:07,859 --> 00:37:09,025
- Look at it this way: If it

1295
00:37:09,027 --> 00:37:10,026
doesn't, I've got you back on

1296
00:37:10,028 --> 00:37:11,061
the road to get in shape.

1297
00:37:11,063 --> 00:37:11,928
- I'd rather be riding down

1298
00:37:11,930 --> 00:37:12,996
that road on my harley.

1299
00:37:12,998 --> 00:37:14,431
A lot more fun.

1300
00:37:14,433 --> 00:37:15,365
- What?

1301
00:37:15,367 --> 00:37:16,733
- What what?

1302
00:37:16,735 --> 00:37:17,567
Looking at the new me,

1303
00:37:17,569 --> 00:37:18,268
sweetheart.

1304
00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:19,035
- Really?

1305
00:37:19,037 --> 00:37:20,904
- Don't sound so skeptical.

1306
00:37:20,906 --> 00:37:22,005
I used to be in pretty

1307
00:37:22,007 --> 00:37:23,673
hey, I still am in reasonable

1308
00:37:23,675 --> 00:37:27,010
shape... sorta.

1309
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:31,047
Oh, come on.

1310
00:37:31,049 --> 00:37:32,182
What'd you bring 'em for?

1311
00:37:32,184 --> 00:37:33,049
Hey!

1312
00:37:33,051 --> 00:37:33,917
- Tony Blanchard.

1313
00:37:33,919 --> 00:37:36,119
So nice to meet you, sir.

1314
00:37:36,121 --> 00:37:36,953
- God.

1315
00:37:36,955 --> 00:37:38,455
The pleasure is all mine.

1316
00:37:38,457 --> 00:37:39,990
Tony Blanchard.

1317
00:37:39,992 --> 00:37:41,825
I used to watch you all the

1318
00:37:41,827 --> 00:37:42,792
time, just in awe of

1319
00:37:42,794 --> 00:37:43,793
your talent-- amazing.

1320
00:37:43,795 --> 00:37:44,461
- Thank you, thank you.

1321
00:37:44,463 --> 00:37:45,128
I appreciate it, sir.

1322
00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:45,795
Thank you.

1323
00:37:45,797 --> 00:37:47,631
Hey, I hear you're going to be

1324
00:37:47,633 --> 00:37:48,732
the next mayor of San Diego.

1325
00:37:48,734 --> 00:37:51,334
- Oh... trying, hoping.

1326
00:37:51,336 --> 00:37:52,402
- Where did you think I heard

1327
00:37:52,404 --> 00:37:53,136
it from?

1328
00:37:55,207 --> 00:37:55,872
- Governor!

1329
00:37:55,874 --> 00:37:56,940
- Tony, over here!

1330
00:37:56,942 --> 00:37:59,175
- Just a few questions.

1331
00:37:59,177 --> 00:38:00,010
Governor, do you have any

1332
00:38:00,012 --> 00:38:01,511
releasing his medical records

1333
00:38:01,513 --> 00:38:02,512
later today?

1334
00:38:02,514 --> 00:38:04,781
- Just that it's long overdue.

1335
00:38:04,783 --> 00:38:06,383
We both, we both owe it to the

1336
00:38:06,385 --> 00:38:08,084
voters to be completely up-front

1337
00:38:08,086 --> 00:38:09,052
and open.

1338
00:38:09,054 --> 00:38:10,053
As you know, I released my

1339
00:38:10,055 --> 00:38:11,354
records over two weeks ago.

1340
00:38:11,356 --> 00:38:12,522
But I think if you want to

1341
00:38:12,524 --> 00:38:13,356
occupy this fine house, well,

1342
00:38:13,358 --> 00:38:14,524
the voters have a right to know

1343
00:38:14,526 --> 00:38:15,191
the state of their

1344
00:38:15,193 --> 00:38:15,925
governor's health.

1345
00:38:15,927 --> 00:38:16,926
- Is having Tony Blanchard with

1346
00:38:16,928 --> 00:38:17,727
you today related to

1347
00:38:17,729 --> 00:38:18,428
the release?

1348
00:38:18,430 --> 00:38:19,663
- Absolutely not.

1349
00:38:19,665 --> 00:38:20,664
This is one of the finest

1350
00:38:20,666 --> 00:38:21,598
athletes this country has ever

1351
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,500
produced and when Tony offered

1352
00:38:23,502 --> 00:38:24,834
to take time out of his busy

1353
00:38:24,836 --> 00:38:26,136
schedule to come here, I jumped

1354
00:38:26,138 --> 00:38:26,936
at the chance.

1355
00:38:26,938 --> 00:38:28,371
Not every day you get whooped by

1356
00:38:28,373 --> 00:38:29,472
an all-pro.

1357
00:38:30,442 --> 00:38:31,441
- Tony, what do you think of

1358
00:38:31,443 --> 00:38:32,275
the governor as a jogging

1359
00:38:32,277 --> 00:38:33,243
partner?

1360
00:38:33,245 --> 00:38:34,277
- I think, and let me stress

1361
00:38:34,279 --> 00:38:35,345
<i>think, that I can beat your</i>

1362
00:38:35,347 --> 00:38:36,446
governor today.

1363
00:38:36,448 --> 00:38:38,281
But if I'm in as half as good

1364
00:38:38,283 --> 00:38:39,749
a shape as governor Becker is

1365
00:38:39,751 --> 00:38:41,151
when I hit his age, I'll be

1366
00:38:41,153 --> 00:38:42,385
one happy guy.

1367
00:38:42,387 --> 00:38:43,586
- "His age."

1368
00:38:43,588 --> 00:38:45,522
Get off, go, go long.

1369
00:38:45,524 --> 00:38:46,790
Want to join us?

1370
00:38:46,792 --> 00:38:47,791
- Not in these heels, but have

1371
00:38:47,793 --> 00:38:48,658
a good run, governor.

1372
00:38:49,995 --> 00:38:52,062
- Thanks, governor.

1373
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:58,668
- O.K., here we go.

1374
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:00,103
- Man, you are fast!

1375
00:39:00,105 --> 00:39:02,539
- Not as fast as you and Tony.

1376
00:39:02,541 --> 00:39:03,640
- Cheers to that.

1377
00:39:09,147 --> 00:39:09,979
- For state senator and

1378
00:39:09,981 --> 00:39:11,081
gubernatorial candidate Justin

1379
00:39:11,083 --> 00:39:12,549
Perkins, it was a major day

1380
00:39:12,551 --> 00:39:13,783
indeed.

1381
00:39:13,785 --> 00:39:15,051
Perkins finally released his

1382
00:39:15,053 --> 00:39:16,319
medical records this morning and

1383
00:39:16,321 --> 00:39:17,620
as we've been reporting,

1384
00:39:17,622 --> 00:39:18,288
they showed an

1385
00:39:18,290 --> 00:39:19,756
irregular heartbeat.

1386
00:39:19,758 --> 00:39:20,657
All over the capitol and,

1387
00:39:20,659 --> 00:39:22,158
in fact, the state, this has

1388
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:23,827
been topic number one.

1389
00:39:23,829 --> 00:39:25,228
And earlier the Perkins campaign

1390
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:26,563
made every effort to diminish

1391
00:39:26,565 --> 00:39:28,098
the damage, including having his

1392
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:29,299
personal physician speak to

1393
00:39:29,301 --> 00:39:30,867
reporters here at mercy

1394
00:39:30,869 --> 00:39:31,568
hospital.

1395
00:39:31,570 --> 00:39:32,235
- Thank you.

1396
00:39:32,237 --> 00:39:33,236
Welcome to mercy hospital.

1397
00:39:33,238 --> 00:39:34,537
I'm Dr. Ryan Johnson,

1398
00:39:34,539 --> 00:39:35,405
I'm senator Perkins'

1399
00:39:35,407 --> 00:39:36,873
cardiologist and his

1400
00:39:36,875 --> 00:39:38,041
attending physician.

1401
00:39:38,043 --> 00:39:40,744
Senator Perkins has arrhythmia,

1402
00:39:40,746 --> 00:39:42,846
a condition commonly known as an

1403
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:44,848
irregular heartbeat, a condition

1404
00:39:44,850 --> 00:39:47,417
shared by millions of Americans.

1405
00:39:47,419 --> 00:39:49,119
He is a former professional

1406
00:39:49,121 --> 00:39:50,320
athlete, as everybody in

1407
00:39:50,322 --> 00:39:51,888
Kentucky knows.

1408
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:53,690
He is in superb health.

1409
00:39:53,692 --> 00:39:54,624
There will be no physical

1410
00:39:54,626 --> 00:39:56,092
limitations for him because of

1411
00:39:56,094 --> 00:39:57,026
this condition.

1412
00:39:57,028 --> 00:39:57,861
- But what about the reports

1413
00:39:57,863 --> 00:39:58,528
of steroids?

1414
00:39:59,731 --> 00:40:00,730
- Excuse me, one at a time,

1415
00:40:00,732 --> 00:40:02,232
- why were his records not

1416
00:40:02,234 --> 00:40:03,066
released earlier?

1417
00:40:03,068 --> 00:40:03,900
- I'll refer you to the

1418
00:40:03,902 --> 00:40:04,701
campaign on that.

1419
00:40:04,703 --> 00:40:06,569
Again, he's in superb condition.

1420
00:40:06,571 --> 00:40:07,470
His arrhythmia will have

1421
00:40:07,472 --> 00:40:08,772
no impact.

1422
00:40:08,774 --> 00:40:10,507
- Any evidence of S.T.D.S?

1423
00:40:10,509 --> 00:40:11,674
- That's an offensive question

1424
00:40:11,676 --> 00:40:12,776
that I won't be answering.

1425
00:40:14,279 --> 00:40:15,111
- ...at the same time,

1426
00:40:15,113 --> 00:40:15,945
our current governor had a

1427
00:40:15,947 --> 00:40:16,913
different take on the

1428
00:40:16,915 --> 00:40:17,814
day's events.

1429
00:40:17,816 --> 00:40:19,015
- Let me begin by saying that

1430
00:40:19,017 --> 00:40:20,350
the issue of a person's health

1431
00:40:20,352 --> 00:40:21,751
is far more important than any

1432
00:40:21,753 --> 00:40:24,287
political campaign, but this is

1433
00:40:24,289 --> 00:40:26,489
really about the public trust.

1434
00:40:26,491 --> 00:40:27,657
If the public can't trust you to

1435
00:40:27,659 --> 00:40:28,491
be up-front about your own

1436
00:40:28,493 --> 00:40:29,826
health, then how can they trust

1437
00:40:29,828 --> 00:40:30,693
you with the health of

1438
00:40:30,695 --> 00:40:32,095
our state?

1439
00:40:32,097 --> 00:40:33,163
Of course, Sophia and I will

1440
00:40:33,165 --> 00:40:34,197
have state senator Perkins in

1441
00:40:34,199 --> 00:40:35,265
our hearts and our prayers

1442
00:40:35,267 --> 00:40:36,766
tonight, when it comes to his

1443
00:40:36,768 --> 00:40:39,002
overcoming this very serious

1444
00:40:39,004 --> 00:40:40,570
health problem.

1445
00:40:40,572 --> 00:40:41,738
...I think if you want to occupy

1446
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:42,739
this fine house, the voters have

1447
00:40:42,741 --> 00:40:43,907
a right to know the state of

1448
00:40:43,909 --> 00:40:44,974
their governor's health.

1449
00:40:44,976 --> 00:40:46,075
- And later in the day,

1450
00:40:46,077 --> 00:40:47,544
Tony Blanchard spoke to a

1451
00:40:47,546 --> 00:40:49,078
packed-to-the-rafters crowd at

1452
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:50,814
leland middle school and then

1453
00:40:50,816 --> 00:40:53,583
afterward, signed autographs.

1454
00:40:53,585 --> 00:40:55,251
And for those lucky kids getting

1455
00:40:55,253 --> 00:40:56,786
to meet our governor's all-pro

1456
00:40:56,788 --> 00:40:58,755
jogging partner, it'll be a day

1457
00:40:58,757 --> 00:40:59,889
they remember their

1458
00:40:59,891 --> 00:41:00,957
entire lives.

1459
00:41:00,959 --> 00:41:01,858
- Lucky!

1460
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:02,692
- And we caught up

1461
00:41:02,694 --> 00:41:03,693
with governor Becker as he

1462
00:41:03,695 --> 00:41:05,462
attended a talk and book signing

1463
00:41:05,464 --> 00:41:06,763
for football superstar Tony

1464
00:41:06,765 --> 00:41:07,931
Blanchard at the pine

1465
00:41:07,933 --> 00:41:11,167
valley mall.

1466
00:41:11,169 --> 00:41:12,702
...some rush there, governor!

1467
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:14,037
- Well, I promised I'd come

1468
00:41:14,039 --> 00:41:15,505
hear Tony speak, he's a good

1469
00:41:15,507 --> 00:41:16,372
friend and I'm running

1470
00:41:16,374 --> 00:41:17,207
a little late.

1471
00:41:17,209 --> 00:41:18,208
You know, like everyone else in

1472
00:41:18,210 --> 00:41:19,742
America, I cheered when he made

1473
00:41:19,744 --> 00:41:21,644
that unbelievable super bowl run

1474
00:41:21,646 --> 00:41:22,912
and I'm cheering for him now

1475
00:41:22,914 --> 00:41:24,214
that he's setting such a fine

1476
00:41:24,216 --> 00:41:26,015
example for Kentucky's children.

1477
00:41:26,017 --> 00:41:26,683
- Thanks for your time,

1478
00:41:26,685 --> 00:41:29,452
governor.

1479
00:41:29,454 --> 00:41:30,386
- Wow.

1480
00:41:30,388 --> 00:41:32,255
- It's a Picasso.

1481
00:41:32,257 --> 00:41:32,922
- Sure.

1482
00:41:32,924 --> 00:41:33,823
A Picasso.

1483
00:41:33,825 --> 00:41:35,492
- The escalator was genius.

1484
00:41:35,494 --> 00:41:36,326
- And you had the cameras

1485
00:41:36,328 --> 00:41:37,327
everywhere they needed to be.

1486
00:41:37,329 --> 00:41:38,828
Just a great job.

1487
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:39,762
It's great, a great job.

1488
00:41:39,764 --> 00:41:41,130
- Thanks, sweetheart.

1489
00:41:41,132 --> 00:41:45,001
I owe you.

1490
00:41:45,003 --> 00:41:47,904
Well... that is it for jogging!

1491
00:41:47,906 --> 00:41:48,571
- No, no, no.

1492
00:41:48,573 --> 00:41:49,572
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1493
00:41:49,574 --> 00:41:50,573
Once a week, every week until

1494
00:41:50,575 --> 00:41:51,808
the campaign ends.

1495
00:41:51,810 --> 00:41:52,475
- What?

1496
00:41:52,477 --> 00:41:53,309
Can't we just release some

1497
00:41:53,311 --> 00:41:54,277
photos or something?

1498
00:42:01,819 --> 00:42:02,919
- Just one, because you and I

1499
00:42:02,921 --> 00:42:03,987
are going to the Seville bar

1500
00:42:03,989 --> 00:42:04,654
later.

1501
00:42:04,656 --> 00:42:05,321
- The wine bar?

1502
00:42:05,323 --> 00:42:06,289
- The wine bar.

1503
00:42:06,291 --> 00:42:07,056
- Seems a little upscale

1504
00:42:07,058 --> 00:42:07,924
for you.

1505
00:42:07,926 --> 00:42:08,591
- Upscale?

1506
00:42:08,593 --> 00:42:09,392
Really, why?

1507
00:42:09,394 --> 00:42:10,126
What do you mean?

1508
00:42:10,128 --> 00:42:10,960
- The girls keep their clothes

1509
00:42:10,962 --> 00:42:11,628
on, for one thing.

1510
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:13,129
- Don't be so sure.

1511
00:42:13,131 --> 00:42:14,631
- There's this waitress there

1512
00:42:14,633 --> 00:42:16,165
named Lara.

1513
00:42:16,167 --> 00:42:17,667
Oh, my God, she's absolutely

1514
00:42:17,669 --> 00:42:18,668
gorgeous.

1515
00:42:18,670 --> 00:42:19,836
- Is she the new thing?

1516
00:42:19,838 --> 00:42:20,670
- Well, actually, she's more

1517
00:42:20,672 --> 00:42:21,571
your type.

1518
00:42:21,573 --> 00:42:22,238
- Why are we going

1519
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:23,106
to the Seville?

1520
00:42:23,108 --> 00:42:27,510
- O.K., Lara, who is becoming

1521
00:42:27,512 --> 00:42:29,712
very tight with myself,

1522
00:42:29,714 --> 00:42:31,247
has agreed to show

1523
00:42:31,249 --> 00:42:32,448
some pictures.

1524
00:42:32,450 --> 00:42:33,116
- Really?

1525
00:42:33,118 --> 00:42:34,517
- Yeah. - Clothed?

1526
00:42:34,519 --> 00:42:36,019
- Kinda, sorta.

1527
00:42:36,021 --> 00:42:40,290
- Regarding... bite marks...

1528
00:42:40,292 --> 00:42:43,826
Of a certain set of teeth...

1529
00:42:43,828 --> 00:42:47,497
From a person of interest.

1530
00:42:47,499 --> 00:42:49,966
Regarding a certain fleshy part

1531
00:42:49,968 --> 00:42:51,834
of the body.

1532
00:42:52,737 --> 00:42:53,403
- What are you still

1533
00:42:53,405 --> 00:42:54,070
doing here?

1534
00:42:54,072 --> 00:42:55,004
- You're here, boss.

1535
00:42:55,006 --> 00:42:57,373
Anyway I love this spot.

1536
00:42:57,375 --> 00:42:58,374
- Love it?

1537
00:42:58,376 --> 00:42:59,042
- Swiftboat the

1538
00:42:59,044 --> 00:43:00,076
swiftboaters, dude.

1539
00:43:00,078 --> 00:43:01,811
It's still rough, and my voice,

1540
00:43:01,813 --> 00:43:02,812
but we'll get don in here

1541
00:43:02,814 --> 00:43:04,047
tomorrow, if you like it.

1542
00:43:04,049 --> 00:43:05,214
- Let's have a look.

1543
00:43:05,917 --> 00:43:06,783
- Jimmy on computer:

1544
00:43:06,785 --> 00:43:08,318
Imagine this: You attend

1545
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:09,752
Annapolis.

1546
00:43:09,754 --> 00:43:11,287
You play football there...

1547
00:43:11,289 --> 00:43:12,755
And did so well, you had the

1548
00:43:12,757 --> 00:43:13,990
chance to go on and play

1549
00:43:13,992 --> 00:43:15,091
professionally.

1550
00:43:15,093 --> 00:43:16,893
But instead, you turned down the

1551
00:43:16,895 --> 00:43:19,195
NFL and went to fight for

1552
00:43:19,197 --> 00:43:20,229
your country.

1553
00:43:20,231 --> 00:43:21,531
Your leadership was recognized

1554
00:43:21,533 --> 00:43:23,933
with the Navy cross and then,

1555
00:43:23,935 --> 00:43:25,468
years later, someone begins

1556
00:43:25,470 --> 00:43:26,536
knocking on the doors of those

1557
00:43:26,538 --> 00:43:27,937
who served with you.

1558
00:43:27,939 --> 00:43:29,539
- They came into my house and

1559
00:43:29,541 --> 00:43:31,407
started asking me questions

1560
00:43:31,409 --> 00:43:33,543
about Stephen green and all the

1561
00:43:33,545 --> 00:43:34,777
bad things he had done when he

1562
00:43:34,779 --> 00:43:36,479
was a lieutenant in my unit.

1563
00:43:36,481 --> 00:43:37,780
Bad things?

1564
00:43:37,782 --> 00:43:38,781
There wasn't an officer in all

1565
00:43:38,783 --> 00:43:39,882
of Afghanistan as respected as

1566
00:43:39,884 --> 00:43:41,017
he was.

1567
00:43:41,019 --> 00:43:42,018
- Yeah, they asked me the same

1568
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:43,152
thing, and every time I said

1569
00:43:43,154 --> 00:43:44,087
something good about Stephen

1570
00:43:44,089 --> 00:43:45,355
green, they wanted

1571
00:43:45,357 --> 00:43:46,723
something bad.

1572
00:43:46,725 --> 00:43:48,057
This is the guy who put his body

1573
00:43:48,059 --> 00:43:49,492
between us and the Taliban.

1574
00:43:49,494 --> 00:43:50,326
And what they're doing is

1575
00:43:50,328 --> 00:43:51,294
un-American.

1576
00:43:51,296 --> 00:43:52,462
So I asked them to please leave

1577
00:43:52,464 --> 00:43:53,496
my house.

1578
00:43:53,498 --> 00:43:54,664
Far too many of our friends are

1579
00:43:54,666 --> 00:43:55,999
buried here.

1580
00:43:56,001 --> 00:43:57,533
And it shocks me that instead of

1581
00:43:57,535 --> 00:43:58,801
honoring those that fought and

1582
00:43:58,803 --> 00:44:00,103
died for this country,

1583
00:44:00,105 --> 00:44:01,471
duff Campbell is spending his

1584
00:44:01,473 --> 00:44:03,106
money looking for some kinda

1585
00:44:03,108 --> 00:44:05,441
dirt that doesn't even exist on

1586
00:44:05,443 --> 00:44:06,643
the finest officer I had the

1587
00:44:06,645 --> 00:44:08,244
honor to serve under:

1588
00:44:08,246 --> 00:44:10,546
Lieutenant Stephen green.

1589
00:44:20,057 --> 00:44:21,257
- Fuck you, motherfucker!

1590
00:44:21,259 --> 00:44:22,158
- Ohh!

1591
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:24,594
That is a Rembrandt!

1592
00:44:24,596 --> 00:44:25,662
Yeah!

1593
00:44:25,664 --> 00:44:26,529
Yeah!

1594
00:44:27,899 --> 00:44:29,032
Kerstin's still here?

1595
00:44:29,034 --> 00:44:30,466
- Yeah, she's on the roof.

1596
00:44:35,305 --> 00:44:37,173
- Hey.

1597
00:44:37,175 --> 00:44:39,242
- Hey.

1598
00:44:39,244 --> 00:44:40,476
- You gonna jump?

1599
00:44:40,478 --> 00:44:41,577
- I should.

1600
00:44:41,579 --> 00:44:42,412
- Is that the Stephen green

1601
00:44:42,414 --> 00:44:43,446
stuff?

1602
00:44:43,448 --> 00:44:46,616
- No, it's not that.

1603
00:44:46,618 --> 00:44:47,950
Read.

1604
00:44:49,387 --> 00:44:50,620
- "I first aspired to go to

1605
00:44:50,622 --> 00:44:52,021
medical school when, as a small

1606
00:44:52,023 --> 00:44:53,056
child, I would accompany my

1607
00:44:53,058 --> 00:44:54,524
Uncle to his small pediatric

1608
00:44:54,526 --> 00:44:56,092
clinic in seoul where he was a

1609
00:44:56,094 --> 00:44:58,227
beloved figure"-- what is this?

1610
00:44:58,229 --> 00:44:59,729
- Well, that's my life.

1611
00:44:59,731 --> 00:45:01,364
The cliche of my life.

1612
00:45:01,366 --> 00:45:02,532
It's what you do when you're

1613
00:45:02,534 --> 00:45:03,666
first generation American and

1614
00:45:03,668 --> 00:45:05,768
your parents run a fruit market

1615
00:45:05,770 --> 00:45:07,437
in the shadows of Berkeley.

1616
00:45:07,439 --> 00:45:09,138
They work, like, 15 hours a day,

1617
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:11,274
just so that one day, you can go

1618
00:45:11,276 --> 00:45:13,209
to that very same college.

1619
00:45:13,211 --> 00:45:15,611
- And become a surgeon.

1620
00:45:15,613 --> 00:45:16,612
- Not just that.

1621
00:45:16,614 --> 00:45:17,880
I could be an internationally

1622
00:45:17,882 --> 00:45:20,850
renowned concert pianist, or a

1623
00:45:20,852 --> 00:45:21,951
Professor in electrical

1624
00:45:21,953 --> 00:45:25,288
engineering.

1625
00:45:25,290 --> 00:45:28,858
- But you ended up here.

1626
00:45:28,860 --> 00:45:29,726
- I thought it was a

1627
00:45:29,728 --> 00:45:32,829
good thing.

1628
00:45:32,831 --> 00:45:34,330
- Well, I can't offer you a lab

1629
00:45:34,332 --> 00:45:37,834
coat, but... the truth of it is,

1630
00:45:37,836 --> 00:45:40,436
is that, as fucked up as things

1631
00:45:40,438 --> 00:45:43,005
are and as bad as they may seem,

1632
00:45:43,007 --> 00:45:44,107
that most people really believe

1633
00:45:44,109 --> 00:45:44,941
that leaders can make a

1634
00:45:44,943 --> 00:45:46,542
difference.

1635
00:45:46,544 --> 00:45:47,376
If you're helping great leaders

1636
00:45:47,378 --> 00:45:48,511
get in, aren't you doing a

1637
00:45:48,513 --> 00:45:50,379
service?

1638
00:45:50,381 --> 00:45:55,184
- Yeah, I know, but...

1639
00:45:55,186 --> 00:45:57,386
- It doesn't fit the narrative.

1640
00:45:57,388 --> 00:45:59,155
The cliche that we work with

1641
00:45:59,157 --> 00:46:01,190
every day.

1642
00:46:01,192 --> 00:46:02,959
- Like being the daughter of

1643
00:46:02,961 --> 00:46:05,728
outrageously hard-working Korean

1644
00:46:05,730 --> 00:46:08,297
immigrants who one day goes off

1645
00:46:08,299 --> 00:46:11,868
to Johns Hopkins medical school.

1646
00:46:11,870 --> 00:46:13,436
- You broke out of your cliche.

1647
00:46:13,438 --> 00:46:18,274
I think that's a great thing.

1648
00:46:18,276 --> 00:46:23,846
Look... on election night,

1649
00:46:23,848 --> 00:46:26,649
when your guy goes over the top,

1650
00:46:26,651 --> 00:46:28,751
the feeling is

1651
00:46:28,753 --> 00:46:32,688
un-fucking-believable.

1652
00:46:32,690 --> 00:46:34,490
It courses through your veins

1653
00:46:34,492 --> 00:46:36,826
like nothing else.

1654
00:46:36,828 --> 00:46:37,660
- See, that's what I want

1655
00:46:37,662 --> 00:46:39,195
to do, I...

1656
00:46:39,197 --> 00:46:40,596
I want to do what you do.

1657
00:46:40,598 --> 00:46:42,365
I want to make kings and queens,

1658
00:46:42,367 --> 00:46:44,133
but I can't do what you do.

1659
00:46:44,135 --> 00:46:45,134
- You can.

1660
00:46:45,136 --> 00:46:47,436
And you'll be better than I am.

1661
00:46:47,438 --> 00:46:50,540
- No...

1662
00:46:50,542 --> 00:46:53,743
I can't.

1663
00:46:53,745 --> 00:46:54,577
- Then you'll be a great

1664
00:46:54,579 --> 00:46:56,979
doctor...

1665
00:46:56,981 --> 00:47:01,350
A Penelope-great doctor.

1666
00:47:01,352 --> 00:47:02,185
I'll write a letter of

1667
00:47:02,187 --> 00:47:04,120
I'll get the vice-president of

1668
00:47:04,122 --> 00:47:05,221
the United States to write a

1669
00:47:05,223 --> 00:47:06,155
letter of recommendation

1670
00:47:06,157 --> 00:47:09,358
for you.

1671
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:13,462
- I'm sorry, but thank you.

1672
00:47:18,736 --> 00:47:20,436
Thanks.

1673
00:47:31,582 --> 00:47:32,615
- That photo probably cost him

1674
00:47:32,617 --> 00:47:35,585
five grand.

1675
00:47:36,820 --> 00:47:37,753
- For you.

1676
00:47:37,755 --> 00:47:38,721
- You're kidding.

1677
00:47:38,723 --> 00:47:40,122
- Not at all.

1678
00:47:40,124 --> 00:47:41,457
I go to meetings all the time

1679
00:47:41,459 --> 00:47:42,458
and all I get from them

1680
00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:43,125
is a headache.

1681
00:47:43,127 --> 00:47:44,026
Now, at least, you'll have

1682
00:47:44,028 --> 00:47:45,461
something good to remember our

1683
00:47:45,463 --> 00:47:46,295
little talk by.

1684
00:47:46,297 --> 00:47:47,296
Sit.

1685
00:47:47,298 --> 00:47:48,130
- Well, hopefully we'll be able

1686
00:47:48,132 --> 00:47:49,131
to provide a happy memory

1687
00:47:49,133 --> 00:47:50,299
of our talk.

1688
00:47:50,301 --> 00:47:51,601
- We can all use them, or more

1689
00:47:51,603 --> 00:47:53,603
to the point, uh, your man

1690
00:47:53,605 --> 00:47:55,705
Stephen green can.

1691
00:47:55,707 --> 00:47:56,939
Not happy times for our junior

1692
00:47:56,941 --> 00:47:58,608
senator, huh, Paul?

1693
00:47:58,610 --> 00:47:59,308
- Well, I don't know

1694
00:47:59,310 --> 00:47:59,976
about that.

1695
00:47:59,978 --> 00:48:01,010
He's up nine points in the

1696
00:48:01,012 --> 00:48:02,211
latest field poll, he's got 16

1697
00:48:02,213 --> 00:48:03,980
major newspaper endorsements and

1698
00:48:03,982 --> 00:48:04,780
more importantly, he's doing

1699
00:48:04,782 --> 00:48:06,215
great things for the state.

1700
00:48:06,217 --> 00:48:07,483
- Spare me.

1701
00:48:07,485 --> 00:48:08,417
We're in a no-spin zone

1702
00:48:08,419 --> 00:48:09,685
here, Paul.

1703
00:48:09,687 --> 00:48:11,520
We both know that he's got a

1704
00:48:11,522 --> 00:48:12,922
giant bull's-eye painted on his

1705
00:48:12,924 --> 00:48:15,391
back and I have a huge fuckin'

1706
00:48:15,393 --> 00:48:16,392
archer standing right

1707
00:48:16,394 --> 00:48:17,693
behind him.

1708
00:48:17,695 --> 00:48:19,462
- But you haven't fired.

1709
00:48:19,464 --> 00:48:20,630
- I wanted to see what you had

1710
00:48:20,632 --> 00:48:21,464
to offer first.

1711
00:48:21,466 --> 00:48:22,498
- You're interested in

1712
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:23,900
our story?

1713
00:48:23,902 --> 00:48:24,767
- Of course.

1714
00:48:24,769 --> 00:48:25,434
We're fair.

1715
00:48:25,436 --> 00:48:26,102
We're balanced.

1716
00:48:26,104 --> 00:48:26,836
We're a news organization,

1717
00:48:26,838 --> 00:48:27,603
for Christ's sake, Paul,

1718
00:48:27,605 --> 00:48:29,772
- Well, I'm not sure

1719
00:48:29,774 --> 00:48:30,873
that I agree with any of

1720
00:48:30,875 --> 00:48:33,910
those claims.

1721
00:48:33,912 --> 00:48:35,511
Our story is that there

1722
00:48:35,513 --> 00:48:37,213
is no story.

1723
00:48:37,215 --> 00:48:38,214
<i>Nada.</i>

1724
00:48:38,216 --> 00:48:39,548
Nothing.

1725
00:48:39,550 --> 00:48:40,283
Zilch.

1726
00:48:40,285 --> 00:48:41,217
- Mmm.

1727
00:48:41,219 --> 00:48:43,185
That's too bad.

1728
00:48:43,187 --> 00:48:44,353
Then I guess we'll be hearing a

1729
00:48:44,355 --> 00:48:46,088
lot more from miss Shearson.

1730
00:48:46,090 --> 00:48:47,156
It's horrible, what that poor

1731
00:48:47,158 --> 00:48:49,091
girl experienced.

1732
00:48:49,093 --> 00:48:49,825
- Something tells me she's

1733
00:48:49,827 --> 00:48:51,794
going to be just fine.

1734
00:48:51,796 --> 00:48:53,129
I was hoping you would do me a

1735
00:48:53,131 --> 00:48:54,797
personal favor.

1736
00:48:54,799 --> 00:48:56,399
I'd like you to kill any stories

1737
00:48:56,401 --> 00:48:58,067
with her ridiculous claims.

1738
00:48:58,069 --> 00:49:00,403
- You must be joking.

1739
00:49:00,405 --> 00:49:01,537
- Not at all.

1740
00:49:01,539 --> 00:49:02,438
You see, I've recently become

1741
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:03,539
aware of a waitress at the

1742
00:49:03,541 --> 00:49:06,108
Seville wine bar named Lara.

1743
00:49:06,110 --> 00:49:06,943
She tells a pretty incredible

1744
00:49:06,945 --> 00:49:08,811
story.

1745
00:49:08,813 --> 00:49:10,179
- I've never been there.

1746
00:49:10,181 --> 00:49:11,614
- The story is, guy comes in,

1747
00:49:11,616 --> 00:49:14,750
is drinking, he's interested.

1748
00:49:14,752 --> 00:49:18,087
He bites her ass in the bar.

1749
00:49:18,089 --> 00:49:19,989
Now, it's, it's-- that was my

1750
00:49:19,991 --> 00:49:22,758
reaction as well.

1751
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:23,759
So she tells her friend,

1752
00:49:23,761 --> 00:49:24,860
who also works there, and it

1753
00:49:24,862 --> 00:49:26,228
turns out, the same guy did the

1754
00:49:26,230 --> 00:49:29,966
same thing to her too.

1755
00:49:29,968 --> 00:49:31,367
- Really?

1756
00:49:31,369 --> 00:49:32,902
- And there's more.

1757
00:49:32,904 --> 00:49:34,103
Apparently the guy is so rich--

1758
00:49:34,105 --> 00:49:35,338
he was brought in to run a

1759
00:49:35,340 --> 00:49:36,372
television station or

1760
00:49:36,374 --> 00:49:39,008
something-- that both girls,

1761
00:49:39,010 --> 00:49:40,276
looking for opportunities as

1762
00:49:40,278 --> 00:49:41,477
people are wont to do in these

1763
00:49:41,479 --> 00:49:42,745
tough economic times,

1764
00:49:42,747 --> 00:49:44,513
take pictures... - Hmm.

1765
00:49:44,515 --> 00:49:45,781
- ...of the bite marks and

1766
00:49:45,783 --> 00:49:47,750
what this guy did to them.

1767
00:49:47,752 --> 00:49:52,355
I thought you'd want to know.

1768
00:49:52,357 --> 00:49:53,522
I can have this story up on

1769
00:49:53,524 --> 00:49:54,357
<i>Gawker before I get back</i>

1770
00:49:54,359 --> 00:49:55,324
to my office.

1771
00:49:55,326 --> 00:49:56,459
Most of the major media outlets

1772
00:49:56,461 --> 00:49:57,493
will probably pick it up.

1773
00:49:57,495 --> 00:49:59,128
<i>Certainly the chronicle.</i>

1774
00:49:59,130 --> 00:50:00,863
Maybe some other television

1775
00:50:00,865 --> 00:50:01,564
stations?

1776
00:50:01,566 --> 00:50:07,370
But I'm guessing, not here?

1777
00:50:07,372 --> 00:50:09,605
- Probably not.

1778
00:50:09,607 --> 00:50:13,809
This has been great.

1779
00:50:13,811 --> 00:50:15,411
Paul, best.

1780
00:50:15,413 --> 00:50:16,212
- Thanks for the mug.

1781
00:50:16,214 --> 00:50:20,449
- Absolutely.

1782
00:50:23,220 --> 00:50:24,020
- Hey, guys.

1783
00:50:24,022 --> 00:50:25,821
- I'd like you to meet Angela.

1784
00:50:25,823 --> 00:50:26,655
- Hi.

1785
00:50:26,657 --> 00:50:28,557
Sorry, I was working all day,

1786
00:50:28,559 --> 00:50:30,092
and Dimitris... - What?

1787
00:50:30,094 --> 00:50:31,160
- He spent, like, half your

1788
00:50:31,162 --> 00:50:32,695
company's budget on me tonight.

1789
00:50:33,398 --> 00:50:34,330
- Just few drinks.

1790
00:50:34,332 --> 00:50:35,664
This girl can go toe-to-toe with

1791
00:50:35,666 --> 00:50:36,932
the best.

1792
00:50:36,934 --> 00:50:37,867
- You look familiar.

1793
00:50:37,869 --> 00:50:39,435
- Very good, Jimmy!

1794
00:50:39,437 --> 00:50:40,236
There's something in between

1795
00:50:40,238 --> 00:50:40,936
your ears besides

1796
00:50:40,938 --> 00:50:42,204
unlistenable punk.

1797
00:50:42,206 --> 00:50:43,105
Very nice.

1798
00:50:43,107 --> 00:50:45,374
O.K., now tell me, from where?

1799
00:50:45,376 --> 00:50:48,377
And Paul's disqualified.

1800
00:50:48,379 --> 00:50:50,112
Oh, come on, nobody?

1801
00:50:50,114 --> 00:50:51,280
- The tawny video,

1802
00:50:51,282 --> 00:50:52,615
orange bikini.

1803
00:50:52,617 --> 00:50:53,282
- That's my girl.

1804
00:50:53,284 --> 00:50:54,483
- It was red and it's my

1805
00:50:54,485 --> 00:50:55,317
favorite.

1806
00:50:55,319 --> 00:50:56,285
- Red, blue, yellow, who cares?

1807
00:50:56,287 --> 00:50:57,386
You looked that fucking

1808
00:50:57,388 --> 00:50:58,087
beautiful in it.

1809
00:50:58,089 --> 00:50:58,954
- Thank you.

1810
00:50:58,956 --> 00:50:59,822
- You're welcome.

1811
00:50:59,824 --> 00:51:00,823
- O.K., Dimitris says that you

1812
00:51:00,825 --> 00:51:02,191
are a proud graduate of the bay

1813
00:51:02,193 --> 00:51:04,960
city school of massage therapy?

1814
00:51:04,962 --> 00:51:06,162
- She is the all-star graduate.

1815
00:51:06,164 --> 00:51:07,763
She has, she won like the, what,

1816
00:51:07,765 --> 00:51:08,898
the president's award or the

1817
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:10,299
iron cross or something--

1818
00:51:10,301 --> 00:51:11,000
- Hey.

1819
00:51:11,002 --> 00:51:11,867
Hi, I'm sorry.

1820
00:51:11,869 --> 00:51:12,768
- Oh, my God!

1821
00:51:12,770 --> 00:51:13,502
- I'm sorry I'm late.

1822
00:51:13,504 --> 00:51:14,537
- Oh, my God!

1823
00:51:14,539 --> 00:51:15,571
I watch you all the time!

1824
00:51:15,573 --> 00:51:17,073
You're peaches o'Dell!

1825
00:51:17,075 --> 00:51:19,308
You're the best!

1826
00:51:19,310 --> 00:51:21,277
You are very sweet to say that.

1827
00:51:21,279 --> 00:51:23,312
All I ever wanted to be when I

1828
00:51:23,314 --> 00:51:24,480
was a little girl was a TV

1829
00:51:24,482 --> 00:51:25,314
reporter and you did it.

1830
00:51:25,316 --> 00:51:26,015
Look at you.

1831
00:51:26,017 --> 00:51:26,749
And you're like, wow,

1832
00:51:26,751 --> 00:51:28,017
you're here, like, right here,

1833
00:51:28,019 --> 00:51:30,186
on the couch beside me!

1834
00:51:30,188 --> 00:51:31,020
- Angela went to school

1835
00:51:31,022 --> 00:51:32,254
with tawny.

1836
00:51:32,256 --> 00:51:33,422
- Oh?

1837
00:51:33,424 --> 00:51:34,390
What is she like?

1838
00:51:34,392 --> 00:51:35,591
- Mean. - Oh.

1839
00:51:35,593 --> 00:51:36,926
- Well, she's not always,

1840
00:51:36,928 --> 00:51:38,327
but when she drinks, she gets

1841
00:51:38,329 --> 00:51:39,128
that way. - Mm-hmm.

1842
00:51:39,130 --> 00:51:40,496
- Um, pretty, tell her what you

1843
00:51:40,498 --> 00:51:42,565
uh, told me about the Baja.

1844
00:51:42,567 --> 00:51:43,566
- Oh, right, yeah.

1845
00:51:43,568 --> 00:51:44,967
We were out drinking and, well,

1846
00:51:44,969 --> 00:51:46,235
something she did a lot of--

1847
00:51:46,237 --> 00:51:47,603
well, but to be honest, kind of

1848
00:51:47,605 --> 00:51:48,804
something I did a lot of too--

1849
00:51:48,806 --> 00:51:50,639
and we'd had this crazy happy

1850
00:51:50,641 --> 00:51:52,074
hour, where we did way too many

1851
00:51:52,076 --> 00:51:53,809
Tequila shots at the Baja

1852
00:51:53,811 --> 00:51:54,844
Cantina.

1853
00:51:54,846 --> 00:51:55,511
You know it?

1854
00:51:55,513 --> 00:51:56,212
In venice?

1855
00:51:56,214 --> 00:51:57,246
- I don't. - It's awesome!

1856
00:51:57,248 --> 00:51:58,080
- O.K.

1857
00:51:58,082 --> 00:51:59,348
- So when we left, we passed

1858
00:51:59,350 --> 00:52:01,016
this rollerblading place and she

1859
00:52:01,018 --> 00:52:03,319
picked up a pair of knee pads

1860
00:52:03,321 --> 00:52:05,754
and she said, "these guys--

1861
00:52:05,756 --> 00:52:08,524
a ticket to Washington and this

1862
00:52:08,526 --> 00:52:11,327
body and I'm golden!"

1863
00:52:11,329 --> 00:52:12,528
- Nice.

1864
00:52:12,530 --> 00:52:13,529
- But how'd she end up in

1865
00:52:13,531 --> 00:52:14,330
Sacramento?

1866
00:52:14,332 --> 00:52:15,865
- Oh, she had some thing with,

1867
00:52:15,867 --> 00:52:17,600
like a politician dude that she

1868
00:52:17,602 --> 00:52:18,634
thought was gonna go like a

1869
00:52:18,636 --> 00:52:20,302
week, but then he got elected

1870
00:52:20,304 --> 00:52:22,138
speaker of the assembly.

1871
00:52:22,140 --> 00:52:23,139
And when he moved his whole

1872
00:52:23,141 --> 00:52:24,340
family up there, then he brought

1873
00:52:24,342 --> 00:52:25,608
her up too.

1874
00:52:25,610 --> 00:52:27,743
- Wow.

1875
00:52:27,745 --> 00:52:28,677
- I kinda didn't think much

1876
00:52:28,679 --> 00:52:30,546
I didn't think it was that big

1877
00:52:30,548 --> 00:52:31,213
of a deal.

1878
00:52:31,215 --> 00:52:32,414
But then Dimitris...

1879
00:52:32,416 --> 00:52:33,082
- Yes, I did.

1880
00:52:33,084 --> 00:52:34,550
- ...found me and it all

1881
00:52:34,552 --> 00:52:36,352
came back.

1882
00:52:36,354 --> 00:52:39,255
Dimitris found me.

1883
00:52:39,257 --> 00:52:41,423
- Would you be willing to tell

1884
00:52:41,425 --> 00:52:43,159
this story on camera?

1885
00:52:43,161 --> 00:52:43,893
- You want me?

1886
00:52:43,895 --> 00:52:44,727
Peaches o'Dell, you want to,

1887
00:52:44,729 --> 00:52:46,061
you want to interview me?

1888
00:52:46,063 --> 00:52:46,729
- Yep.

1889
00:52:46,731 --> 00:52:47,396
- Hell, yeah!

1890
00:52:47,398 --> 00:52:48,731
Yeah! Yes.

1891
00:52:48,733 --> 00:52:50,633
Absolutely, I would, yes.

1892
00:52:51,602 --> 00:52:53,903
- Thank you, thank you.

1893
00:52:53,905 --> 00:52:55,437
This is a story that needs

1894
00:52:55,439 --> 00:52:56,672
to be heard.

1895
00:52:56,674 --> 00:52:58,073
- Yeah.

1896
00:52:58,075 --> 00:53:00,743
- Mm-hmm.

1897
00:53:00,745 --> 00:53:02,311
Yes.

1898
00:53:02,313 --> 00:53:04,246
- Just keeping the media happy.

1899
00:53:04,248 --> 00:53:05,147
- Fat and happy.

1900
00:53:05,149 --> 00:53:05,848
- Fat?

1901
00:53:05,850 --> 00:53:06,782
I don't think so.

1902
00:53:06,784 --> 00:53:07,483
- Just be glad you're

1903
00:53:07,485 --> 00:53:09,251
not on camera.

1904
00:53:09,253 --> 00:53:10,286
Do you know what I think?

1905
00:53:10,288 --> 00:53:11,020
- Hmm?

1906
00:53:11,022 --> 00:53:13,189
- I think you're running a con.

1907
00:53:13,191 --> 00:53:14,957
- I bring you to the best Sushi

1908
00:53:14,959 --> 00:53:16,125
restaurant in the town and

1909
00:53:16,127 --> 00:53:18,327
this is the thanks I get?

1910
00:53:18,329 --> 00:53:20,896
- Are you?

1911
00:53:20,898 --> 00:53:21,764
- No hidden microphones or

1912
00:53:21,766 --> 00:53:23,399
secret cameras?

1913
00:53:23,401 --> 00:53:24,667
- Wanna pat me down?

1914
00:53:24,669 --> 00:53:26,802
- Absolutely. - No.

1915
00:53:26,804 --> 00:53:28,304
- I think we're surrounded by

1916
00:53:28,306 --> 00:53:29,605
the con.

1917
00:53:29,607 --> 00:53:30,606
"Tax breaks for the rich will

1918
00:53:30,608 --> 00:53:32,107
help the poor, diet drinks will

1919
00:53:32,109 --> 00:53:33,642
help you lose 20 pounds and you

1920
00:53:33,644 --> 00:53:35,311
snag the man of your dreams.

1921
00:53:35,313 --> 00:53:36,679
Paul, please give us the inside

1922
00:53:36,681 --> 00:53:37,947
scoop, we promise we'll treat

1923
00:53:37,949 --> 00:53:39,481
your guy fairly in the story."

1924
00:53:39,483 --> 00:53:40,482
- "And the guy you elect today

1925
00:53:40,484 --> 00:53:41,283
will change your world

1926
00:53:41,285 --> 00:53:43,752
tomorrow."

1927
00:53:43,754 --> 00:53:44,753
- You know the first race I

1928
00:53:44,755 --> 00:53:46,222
ever ran was for my dad's

1929
00:53:46,224 --> 00:53:48,057
childhood friend, Ron Gerace.

1930
00:53:48,059 --> 00:53:49,225
Great guy.

1931
00:53:49,227 --> 00:53:50,559
Just very little formal

1932
00:53:50,561 --> 00:53:53,195
education, but smart and honest.

1933
00:53:53,197 --> 00:53:54,496
He was running for mayor against

1934
00:53:54,498 --> 00:53:56,365
a corrupt asshole who had been

1935
00:53:56,367 --> 00:53:57,399
in office forever and was

1936
00:53:57,401 --> 00:53:58,667
considered unbeatable.

1937
00:53:58,669 --> 00:54:01,103
I was, like, 20 and had no

1938
00:54:01,105 --> 00:54:02,972
experience, but a lot of energy

1939
00:54:02,974 --> 00:54:04,473
and a lot of ideas, but really,

1940
00:54:04,475 --> 00:54:06,075
I didn't know shit.

1941
00:54:06,077 --> 00:54:07,076
- Like now.

1942
00:54:07,078 --> 00:54:09,011
- Even more so.

1943
00:54:09,013 --> 00:54:11,380
- But what I did know was that

1944
00:54:11,382 --> 00:54:13,282
if I worked hard enough and a

1945
00:54:13,284 --> 00:54:15,985
miracle happened and Ron got in,

1946
00:54:15,987 --> 00:54:19,221
that the world would somehow be

1947
00:54:19,223 --> 00:54:21,190
a better place.

1948
00:54:21,192 --> 00:54:22,858
- Did he win?

1949
00:54:22,860 --> 00:54:24,493
- He killed.

1950
00:54:24,495 --> 00:54:25,327
He was the best mayor

1951
00:54:25,329 --> 00:54:27,296
Minneapolis ever had.

1952
00:54:27,298 --> 00:54:30,399
So, as corny as it sounds,

1953
00:54:30,401 --> 00:54:33,769
if you believe, it happens.

1954
00:54:33,771 --> 00:54:36,505
- So what do you believe?

1955
00:54:36,507 --> 00:54:37,973
- That if you get the right guy

1956
00:54:37,975 --> 00:54:42,278
elected, you are so far into a

1957
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:44,980
place that is beyond running a

1958
00:54:44,982 --> 00:54:46,715
campaign or reporting the

1959
00:54:46,717 --> 00:54:51,253
news-- you are making the news,

1960
00:54:51,255 --> 00:54:55,324
and that's what we dream of.

1961
00:54:55,326 --> 00:54:59,295
So, do I believe?

1962
00:54:59,297 --> 00:55:06,902
Yeah, I believe.

1963
00:55:06,904 --> 00:55:08,103
- Conning me?

1964
00:55:08,105 --> 00:55:09,438
- I am not.

1965
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:10,105
It's the truth.

1966
00:55:10,107 --> 00:55:10,806
Straight up.

1967
00:55:10,808 --> 00:55:11,507
Swear to God.

1968
00:55:11,509 --> 00:55:13,309
- Oh, yeah, right.

1969
00:55:13,311 --> 00:55:13,976
That'll be the day.

1970
00:55:14,779 --> 00:55:15,911
That... that is your God.

1971
00:55:15,913 --> 00:55:16,812
You believe in the God

1972
00:55:16,814 --> 00:55:17,980
of BlackBerry.

1973
00:55:17,982 --> 00:55:19,448
- Please, it's only a tool.

1974
00:55:19,450 --> 00:55:20,115
- Right.

1975
00:55:20,117 --> 00:55:21,150
Then, don't answer it.

1976
00:55:21,152 --> 00:55:21,950
I dare you.

1977
00:55:21,952 --> 00:55:22,951
You love that thing more than

1978
00:55:22,953 --> 00:55:24,520
- well, that would be crazy.

1979
00:55:29,060 --> 00:55:33,462
What are you-- what the fuck!

1980
00:55:33,464 --> 00:55:35,230
- It's merely a tool.

1981
00:55:36,033 --> 00:55:36,699
- What?

1982
00:55:36,701 --> 00:55:37,633
- We did a sweeps piece

1983
00:55:37,635 --> 00:55:39,401
I know it looks really weird,

1984
00:55:39,403 --> 00:55:40,636
but the rice will bring it back

1985
00:55:40,638 --> 00:55:41,937
to life.

1986
00:55:41,939 --> 00:55:43,072
- It better.

1987
00:55:43,074 --> 00:55:43,939
- Hmm.

1988
00:55:43,941 --> 00:55:44,773
- Oh, you have some right

1989
00:55:44,775 --> 00:55:45,774
there.

1990
00:55:45,776 --> 00:55:46,709
There you go.

1991
00:55:50,448 --> 00:55:51,613
- I'm not too much of a vapid

1992
00:55:51,615 --> 00:55:52,748
beauty queen?

1993
00:55:52,750 --> 00:55:53,849
- I don't know.

1994
00:55:53,851 --> 00:55:56,118
Not too much of an overeducated,

1995
00:55:56,120 --> 00:55:57,419
BlackBerry-addicted guy running

1996
00:55:57,421 --> 00:55:58,354
a con?

1997
00:56:15,439 --> 00:56:16,972
- Paul, where the hell

1998
00:56:16,974 --> 00:56:17,639
are you?

1999
00:56:17,641 --> 00:56:18,307
I've been emailing you

2000
00:56:18,309 --> 00:56:20,776
every two minutes!

2001
00:56:20,778 --> 00:56:21,944
- You know, I had a long night.

2002
00:56:21,946 --> 00:56:23,145
I had meeting after meeting and

2003
00:56:23,147 --> 00:56:24,847
then I just lost track of time.

2004
00:56:24,849 --> 00:56:26,148
And then I had a BlackBerry

2005
00:56:26,150 --> 00:56:27,983
technical malfunction.

2006
00:56:27,985 --> 00:56:28,951
It works!

2007
00:56:28,953 --> 00:56:30,886
Did you send it to the iPhone?

2008
00:56:30,888 --> 00:56:31,754
I'll look at it there.

2009
00:56:31,756 --> 00:56:34,123
O.K.

2010
00:56:34,125 --> 00:56:34,957
- And we just learned

2011
00:56:34,959 --> 00:56:37,493
tonight that a local man claims

2012
00:56:37,495 --> 00:56:39,027
his girlfriend is having an

2013
00:56:39,029 --> 00:56:40,329
ongoing affair with the

2014
00:56:40,331 --> 00:56:41,697
governor.

2015
00:56:41,699 --> 00:56:43,699
And he claims he has her diary

2016
00:56:43,701 --> 00:56:44,867
to prove it.

2017
00:56:44,869 --> 00:56:45,901
- Sounds like this is one

2018
00:56:45,903 --> 00:56:47,536
explosive story.

2019
00:56:47,538 --> 00:56:48,537
And what was the governor's

2020
00:56:48,539 --> 00:56:49,405
response?

2021
00:56:49,407 --> 00:56:50,506
- Well, nothing yet, Dani.

2022
00:56:50,508 --> 00:56:51,707
And to be fair, this just

2023
00:56:51,709 --> 00:56:53,942
came in...

2024
00:56:53,944 --> 00:56:55,210
- This is terrible.

2025
00:56:55,212 --> 00:56:56,211
We need to get down there.

2026
00:56:56,213 --> 00:56:56,879
What's the first flight

2027
00:56:56,881 --> 00:56:57,546
we can get?

2028
00:56:57,548 --> 00:56:59,148
- Oh, God.

2029
00:56:59,150 --> 00:57:01,350
- Fuck a duck!

2030
00:57:01,352 --> 00:57:02,017
- No, honey-- you fucked

2031
00:57:02,019 --> 00:57:02,684
an intern.

2032
00:57:02,686 --> 00:57:04,753
That's why we're all here.

2033
00:57:04,755 --> 00:57:05,454
- Has anyone actually

2034
00:57:05,456 --> 00:57:07,389
seen the diary?

2035
00:57:07,391 --> 00:57:08,924
- Hey, darlin'.

2036
00:57:16,099 --> 00:57:17,099
- Do we even know that the

2037
00:57:17,101 --> 00:57:17,933
diary's real?

2038
00:57:17,935 --> 00:57:19,034
- We don't and if it's

2039
00:57:19,036 --> 00:57:20,035
electronic, that would be

2040
00:57:20,037 --> 00:57:20,869
a huge break.

2041
00:57:20,871 --> 00:57:22,037
Is she a nutter?

2042
00:57:22,039 --> 00:57:22,938
- No, no.

2043
00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:24,072
She's solid.

2044
00:57:24,074 --> 00:57:24,807
I like her.

2045
00:57:24,809 --> 00:57:27,376
I mean, I, you know what I mean.

2046
00:57:27,378 --> 00:57:28,710
- Paul, as much as I want to

2047
00:57:28,712 --> 00:57:30,279
violently disagree with every

2048
00:57:30,281 --> 00:57:31,880
single thing, every word,

2049
00:57:31,882 --> 00:57:33,882
every syllable, my alleged

2050
00:57:33,884 --> 00:57:35,517
husband says, that one thing

2051
00:57:35,519 --> 00:57:36,885
is true.

2052
00:57:36,887 --> 00:57:37,753
She's the daughter of one

2053
00:57:37,755 --> 00:57:38,887
of our professors.

2054
00:57:38,889 --> 00:57:40,022
- And?

2055
00:57:40,024 --> 00:57:41,023
- And you're not going to kobe

2056
00:57:41,025 --> 00:57:42,391
Bryant her, turn her into some

2057
00:57:42,393 --> 00:57:44,626
sort of predatory slut.

2058
00:57:44,628 --> 00:57:45,527
- We're just getting

2059
00:57:45,529 --> 00:57:46,462
started here.

2060
00:57:46,464 --> 00:57:47,396
- She may not be perfect,

2061
00:57:47,398 --> 00:57:48,664
or even completely innocent,

2062
00:57:48,666 --> 00:57:50,065
I have no idea.

2063
00:57:50,067 --> 00:57:50,933
But you are not going

2064
00:57:50,935 --> 00:57:51,600
to trash her.

2065
00:57:51,602 --> 00:57:52,301
- Look, honey--

2066
00:57:52,303 --> 00:57:53,335
- no, honey.

2067
00:57:53,337 --> 00:57:54,803
You guys trash her and I won't

2068
00:57:54,805 --> 00:57:55,637
be there to do my

2069
00:57:55,639 --> 00:57:57,105
stand-by-my-man thing and then

2070
00:57:57,107 --> 00:57:59,274
you're really fucked.

2071
00:57:59,276 --> 00:58:00,809
Honey.

2072
00:58:08,986 --> 00:58:12,087
So what do we do?

2073
00:58:12,089 --> 00:58:14,756
- Sweetie, we have entered a

2074
00:58:14,758 --> 00:58:19,661
deep, dark, unspinnable place.

2075
00:58:43,286 --> 00:58:45,153
- Ah, it's nice to know no

2076
00:58:45,155 --> 00:58:46,622
matter how bad things get,

2077
00:58:46,624 --> 00:58:47,789
there's gonna be a naked girl on

2078
00:58:47,791 --> 00:58:49,324
a pole to cheer you right up.

2079
00:58:49,326 --> 00:58:51,793
- Try many, many girls, hi.

2080
00:58:51,795 --> 00:58:53,462
You object?

2081
00:58:53,464 --> 00:58:54,463
- Enjoying.

2082
00:58:54,465 --> 00:58:55,564
- That's my girl.

2083
00:58:55,566 --> 00:58:56,331
There's a gentleman sitting

2084
00:58:56,333 --> 00:58:57,199
across the way in a

2085
00:58:57,201 --> 00:58:58,834
football Jersey.

2086
00:58:58,836 --> 00:58:59,868
That's the boyfriend.

2087
00:58:59,870 --> 00:59:01,036
His name is junior, believe it

2088
00:59:01,038 --> 00:59:03,005
or not, junior Conway.

2089
00:59:03,007 --> 00:59:05,140
He's here all the time.

2090
00:59:05,142 --> 00:59:06,141
- Don't get me wrong, I could

2091
00:59:06,143 --> 00:59:07,142
stay here all day, but you've

2092
00:59:07,144 --> 00:59:08,243
got to do better than that.

2093
00:59:08,245 --> 00:59:09,344
- Patience, my friend,

2094
00:59:09,346 --> 00:59:10,712
patience.

2095
00:59:10,714 --> 00:59:11,713
- Junior?

2096
00:59:11,715 --> 00:59:12,648
He sells coke to everyone:

2097
00:59:12,650 --> 00:59:14,416
Girls, customers.

2098
00:59:14,418 --> 00:59:15,450
Shit, he probably even sells it

2099
00:59:15,452 --> 00:59:17,419
to the cops that come in.

2100
00:59:17,421 --> 00:59:21,523
- O.K., what about her?

2101
00:59:21,525 --> 00:59:23,725
- I did see her once.

2102
00:59:23,727 --> 00:59:25,594
- And did junior there provide

2103
00:59:25,596 --> 00:59:27,396
the refreshments?

2104
00:59:27,398 --> 00:59:29,531
- Yes and no.

2105
00:59:29,533 --> 00:59:30,832
- What do you mean?

2106
00:59:30,834 --> 00:59:31,767
- One time we were all,

2107
00:59:31,769 --> 00:59:32,901
like, three girls from the club,

2108
00:59:32,903 --> 00:59:33,902
junior and a couple of his

2109
00:59:33,904 --> 00:59:35,203
buddies-- we were at a frat

2110
00:59:35,205 --> 00:59:36,705
party in Lexington, doing a

2111
00:59:36,707 --> 00:59:38,507
bunch of junior's blow and he

2112
00:59:38,509 --> 00:59:40,208
kept telling her to do it.

2113
00:59:40,210 --> 00:59:41,376
- But she didn't want to do it?

2114
00:59:41,378 --> 00:59:42,277
- Not really.

2115
00:59:42,279 --> 00:59:43,912
She kept saying no and junior

2116
00:59:43,914 --> 00:59:45,080
wouldn't let it go.

2117
00:59:45,082 --> 00:59:46,415
He was buggin' on it and he kept

2118
00:59:46,417 --> 00:59:47,182
saying over and over,

2119
00:59:47,184 --> 00:59:48,283
"are you 22 or 62?

2120
00:59:48,285 --> 00:59:49,518
Just go for it!"

2121
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:50,953
- Did she do any?

2122
00:59:50,955 --> 00:59:52,120
- She did a tiny bit of the

2123
00:59:52,122 --> 00:59:53,388
blow and then, five minutes

2124
00:59:53,390 --> 00:59:54,890
later, she went home alone.

2125
00:59:54,892 --> 00:59:56,058
I mean, if I had to guess,

2126
00:59:56,060 --> 00:59:57,326
that was probably the beginning

2127
00:59:57,328 --> 00:59:58,060
of the end.

2128
00:59:58,062 --> 00:59:58,894
I mean, they're just so

2129
00:59:58,896 --> 00:59:59,828
different.

2130
00:59:59,830 --> 01:00:00,996
- Did you ever see her do the

2131
01:00:00,998 --> 01:00:01,964
drugs again?

2132
01:00:01,966 --> 01:00:02,965
- I mean, I barely saw her

2133
01:00:08,405 --> 01:00:10,005
- It's go time.

2134
01:00:10,007 --> 01:00:10,739
It's do or die,

2135
01:00:10,741 --> 01:00:12,941
but it's your call.

2136
01:00:12,943 --> 01:00:13,875
- Sophia's going to

2137
01:00:13,877 --> 01:00:15,811
go bat-shit.

2138
01:00:15,813 --> 01:00:17,913
- You should look at this.

2139
01:00:17,915 --> 01:00:19,748
They've made a major ad buy.

2140
01:00:19,750 --> 01:00:20,482
It's about to hit.

2141
01:00:20,484 --> 01:00:21,483
A guy at the station slipped

2142
01:00:21,485 --> 01:00:24,052
it to me.

2143
01:00:24,054 --> 01:00:25,187
- Larry Becker wants us to

2144
01:00:25,189 --> 01:00:26,288
give him another term as

2145
01:00:26,290 --> 01:00:28,357
governor so he can a.) Continue

2146
01:00:28,359 --> 01:00:29,725
to use the governor's office as

2147
01:00:29,727 --> 01:00:31,593
his personal sex spa...

2148
01:00:31,595 --> 01:00:33,462
B.) Use our tax dollars to pay

2149
01:00:33,464 --> 01:00:34,863
the state troopers who guard him

2150
01:00:34,865 --> 01:00:36,164
when he's on the prowl...

2151
01:00:36,166 --> 01:00:38,033
Or c.) Convince you that a girl

2152
01:00:38,035 --> 01:00:39,534
just out of high school really

2153
01:00:39,536 --> 01:00:40,936
isn't the first mistress of

2154
01:00:40,938 --> 01:00:42,671
Kentucky, so he can have four

2155
01:00:42,673 --> 01:00:44,306
more years in office?

2156
01:00:44,308 --> 01:00:46,074
Is this really the kind of man

2157
01:00:46,076 --> 01:00:46,942
you would trust with

2158
01:00:46,944 --> 01:00:48,276
your daughter?

2159
01:00:48,278 --> 01:00:49,311
Or your state?

2160
01:00:49,313 --> 01:00:50,812
- I'm Justin Perkins.

2161
01:00:50,814 --> 01:00:53,115
And I'll restore dignity back to

2162
01:00:53,117 --> 01:00:55,317
the governor's office.

2163
01:00:55,319 --> 01:00:56,018
- I don't know where

2164
01:00:56,020 --> 01:00:57,686
to fucking start.

2165
01:00:57,688 --> 01:00:58,854
And by the way, since when is

2166
01:00:58,856 --> 01:01:00,656
22 just out of high school?

2167
01:01:00,658 --> 01:01:01,490
- She could have been 32,

2168
01:01:01,492 --> 01:01:05,327
they'd have used the same line.

2169
01:01:05,329 --> 01:01:08,597
- Know what's weird?

2170
01:01:08,599 --> 01:01:11,366
She's a good girl... really.

2171
01:01:11,368 --> 01:01:12,034
- Well, the boyfriend is

2172
01:01:12,036 --> 01:01:13,502
asshole central.

2173
01:01:13,504 --> 01:01:14,403
Dimitris already got him

2174
01:01:14,405 --> 01:01:15,771
getting a 100k payday and double

2175
01:01:15,773 --> 01:01:17,105
that if you go down.

2176
01:01:17,107 --> 01:01:20,676
- Oh, fuck me.

2177
01:01:20,678 --> 01:01:21,843
Six months ago, the only way I

2178
01:01:21,845 --> 01:01:23,011
could lose this thing was to get

2179
01:01:23,013 --> 01:01:24,212
caught in bed with a dead girl

2180
01:01:24,214 --> 01:01:26,148
or a live boy.

2181
01:01:26,150 --> 01:01:29,985
Now this.

2182
01:01:29,987 --> 01:01:31,286
- So what's it going to be?

2183
01:01:31,288 --> 01:01:35,991
Sonny or Michael?

2184
01:01:35,993 --> 01:01:38,026
- Sonny.

2185
01:01:38,028 --> 01:01:40,328
Go nuclear.

2186
01:01:40,330 --> 01:01:42,164
- Bloggers. - Yep.

2187
01:01:42,166 --> 01:01:43,699
- TV reporters. - Yeah.

2188
01:01:43,701 --> 01:01:44,866
- Talk show bloviaters and

2189
01:01:44,868 --> 01:01:45,701
newspapers.

2190
01:01:45,703 --> 01:01:46,601
All of them. - Newspapers.

2191
01:01:46,603 --> 01:01:48,904
- City, community, college.

2192
01:01:48,906 --> 01:01:50,405
I want all of our big guys and I

2193
01:01:50,407 --> 01:01:51,239
want every newbie looking to

2194
01:01:51,241 --> 01:01:51,907
break in.

2195
01:01:51,909 --> 01:01:52,741
- O.K., they're set up.

2196
01:01:52,743 --> 01:01:53,408
Got it.

2197
01:01:53,410 --> 01:01:55,577
Background-- just follow the

2198
01:01:55,579 --> 01:01:56,778
money, it leads straight back

2199
01:01:56,780 --> 01:01:57,713
to Perkins.

2200
01:01:57,715 --> 01:01:58,747
...listen, I'm doing you this

2201
01:01:58,749 --> 01:01:59,815
favor so you don't get

2202
01:01:59,817 --> 01:02:02,317
you did all the legwork, but you

2203
01:02:02,319 --> 01:02:03,685
definitely did not get this

2204
01:02:03,687 --> 01:02:05,120
information from us.

2205
01:02:05,122 --> 01:02:06,121
...now this story is yours and

2206
01:02:06,123 --> 01:02:07,489
yours only, but remember,

2207
01:02:07,491 --> 01:02:08,857
whatever you do, don't source

2208
01:02:08,859 --> 01:02:09,958
back to us.

2209
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:10,659
...and remember this is

2210
01:02:10,661 --> 01:02:11,727
embargoed for a seven A.M.

2211
01:02:11,729 --> 01:02:12,894
Online posting tomorrow.

2212
01:02:12,896 --> 01:02:14,563
But you're not giving this to

2213
01:02:14,565 --> 01:02:16,665
because, let's face it, my blog

2214
01:02:16,667 --> 01:02:18,133
drives the cable coverage.

2215
01:02:18,135 --> 01:02:19,000
All the insiders come

2216
01:02:19,002 --> 01:02:19,868
to us first.

2217
01:02:19,870 --> 01:02:21,369
- No, absolutely, you get the

2218
01:02:21,371 --> 01:02:22,204
first pop.

2219
01:02:22,206 --> 01:02:23,205
- This is going to be more

2220
01:02:23,207 --> 01:02:24,873
when I heard about this story,

2221
01:02:24,875 --> 01:02:25,907
I had a blogasm.

2222
01:02:25,909 --> 01:02:26,608
- Now you get multiple

2223
01:02:26,610 --> 01:02:28,777
blogasms.

2224
01:02:28,779 --> 01:02:30,378
- Perkins and his buddies are

2225
01:02:30,380 --> 01:02:32,581
rat-fucking Kentucky.

2226
01:02:32,583 --> 01:02:33,415
...so we're talking about the

2227
01:02:33,417 --> 01:02:34,950
Sunday edition above the

2228
01:02:34,952 --> 01:02:37,052
fold, right? - Right.

2229
01:02:37,054 --> 01:02:38,820
- So I hear that you two are

2230
01:02:38,822 --> 01:02:39,988
Kentucky's answer to woodward

2231
01:02:39,990 --> 01:02:42,758
and Bernstein. - Who?

2232
01:02:45,262 --> 01:02:46,828
- Never mind.

2233
01:02:46,830 --> 01:02:48,663
But I am deep throat.

2234
01:03:05,815 --> 01:03:06,815
- Hey, didn't you go to school

2235
01:03:06,817 --> 01:03:07,749
with that major anchor in

2236
01:03:07,751 --> 01:03:09,217
Lexington, Dani whatever?

2237
01:03:09,219 --> 01:03:10,285
- I competed against her.

2238
01:03:10,287 --> 01:03:11,086
- Well, that's close enough.

2239
01:03:11,088 --> 01:03:12,087
But, if you slipped her the

2240
01:03:12,089 --> 01:03:14,089
- we're not exactly friends.

2241
01:03:14,091 --> 01:03:15,090
- But you can call her, right?

2242
01:03:15,092 --> 01:03:15,757
- Paul.

2243
01:03:15,759 --> 01:03:16,424
- I don't understand

2244
01:03:16,426 --> 01:03:17,092
what's wrong.

2245
01:03:17,094 --> 01:03:18,660
- Paul, shut up and fuck!

2246
01:03:21,098 --> 01:03:22,364
- It had been nearly a week

2247
01:03:22,366 --> 01:03:23,632
since governor Becker last

2248
01:03:23,634 --> 01:03:25,500
answered reporters' questions,

2249
01:03:25,502 --> 01:03:26,868
but when he came out of church

2250
01:03:26,870 --> 01:03:28,270
this morning, the governor

2251
01:03:28,272 --> 01:03:29,371
was finally ready to speak to

2252
01:03:29,373 --> 01:03:32,007
the media.

2253
01:03:32,009 --> 01:03:32,707
- Governor, would you

2254
01:03:32,709 --> 01:03:33,575
like to make a statement?

2255
01:03:33,577 --> 01:03:34,709
- Yes, I would.

2256
01:03:34,711 --> 01:03:35,610
Uh, more than anything,

2257
01:03:35,612 --> 01:03:36,645
these charges are complete and

2258
01:03:36,647 --> 01:03:37,979
utter fiction.

2259
01:03:37,981 --> 01:03:39,214
John Grisham could have written

2260
01:03:39,216 --> 01:03:40,248
this, or better still,

2261
01:03:40,250 --> 01:03:41,550
Stephen king, because this has

2262
01:03:41,552 --> 01:03:43,418
truly been a horror story for

2263
01:03:43,420 --> 01:03:44,786
my family.

2264
01:03:44,788 --> 01:03:46,321
And this alleged diary the man

2265
01:03:46,323 --> 01:03:47,989
claims to have is just more

2266
01:03:47,991 --> 01:03:50,892
fiction, pure and simple.

2267
01:03:50,894 --> 01:03:51,726
- And what about

2268
01:03:51,728 --> 01:03:53,662
Helena St. John, the woman at

2269
01:03:53,664 --> 01:03:54,563
the center of all of

2270
01:03:54,565 --> 01:03:55,530
these charges?

2271
01:03:55,532 --> 01:03:57,065
- Well, Dani, Ms. St. John

2272
01:03:57,067 --> 01:03:58,533
returned to her parents' home

2273
01:03:58,535 --> 01:04:00,068
near Boston, where she was

2274
01:04:00,070 --> 01:04:02,137
briefly seen yesterday.

2275
01:04:02,139 --> 01:04:02,871
- Helena, over here,

2276
01:04:02,873 --> 01:04:03,605
we have a question!

2277
01:04:03,607 --> 01:04:06,174
Why are you denying the affair?

2278
01:04:06,176 --> 01:04:07,342
- Why did you do it,

2279
01:04:07,344 --> 01:04:08,143
Helena?

2280
01:04:08,145 --> 01:04:08,977
Was all the sex consensual?

2281
01:04:08,979 --> 01:04:10,679
Has the governor been in touch

2282
01:04:10,681 --> 01:04:11,680
with you?
- Can we get

2283
01:04:11,682 --> 01:04:13,181
- Is the governor

2284
01:04:13,183 --> 01:04:14,015
going to divorce his wife?

2285
01:04:14,017 --> 01:04:14,883
- Helena, are you in

2286
01:04:14,885 --> 01:04:16,518
rehab now?
- Helena!

2287
01:04:16,520 --> 01:04:18,553
- And Ms. St. John also came up

2288
01:04:18,555 --> 01:04:19,955
back home, when we caught up

2289
01:04:19,957 --> 01:04:21,156
with the governor heading for a

2290
01:04:21,158 --> 01:04:22,524
performance of the good Shepherd

2291
01:04:22,526 --> 01:04:24,226
youth choir, run by Lexington

2292
01:04:24,228 --> 01:04:26,027
police officers.

2293
01:04:26,029 --> 01:04:27,362
- The lady in question is a

2294
01:04:27,364 --> 01:04:29,931
good girl, who like so many fine

2295
01:04:29,933 --> 01:04:31,433
people, from good families,

2296
01:04:31,435 --> 01:04:32,734
fell into that terrible,

2297
01:04:32,736 --> 01:04:35,737
terrible abyss of drugs.

2298
01:04:35,739 --> 01:04:37,072
I wish her all the luck in the

2299
01:04:37,074 --> 01:04:38,206
world in getting her life

2300
01:04:38,208 --> 01:04:39,574
together and I know that with

2301
01:04:39,576 --> 01:04:41,977
assistance of clergy, she will

2302
01:04:41,979 --> 01:04:43,445
be just fine and can become

2303
01:04:43,447 --> 01:04:46,348
clean and sober once again.

2304
01:04:46,350 --> 01:04:47,215
- That's good.

2305
01:04:47,217 --> 01:04:48,149
O.K.

2306
01:04:48,151 --> 01:04:49,784
Here's the spot Jimmy just cut.

2307
01:04:49,786 --> 01:04:50,852
We're running it at 2,000

2308
01:04:50,854 --> 01:04:52,120
points, heavy rotation for the

2309
01:04:52,122 --> 01:04:54,089
next two weeks, major cable buy.

2310
01:04:54,091 --> 01:04:56,157
<i>Lifetime, Ellen, just buying the</i>

2311
01:04:56,159 --> 01:04:59,194
shit out of the mom demo.

2312
01:04:59,196 --> 01:05:00,595
- Some things are pretty

2313
01:05:00,597 --> 01:05:02,197
darn expensive and it makes you

2314
01:05:02,199 --> 01:05:03,865
wonder where all that money

2315
01:05:03,867 --> 01:05:04,766
comes from.

2316
01:05:04,768 --> 01:05:05,967
The cost of incarcerating a

2317
01:05:05,969 --> 01:05:07,269
cocaine dealer in Kentucky for

2318
01:05:07,271 --> 01:05:11,072
15 months? $28,313.

2319
01:05:11,074 --> 01:05:12,607
The cost of a brand-new pickup:

2320
01:05:12,609 --> 01:05:15,744
$34,201, which was purchased two

2321
01:05:15,746 --> 01:05:17,212
days after claiming he had a

2322
01:05:17,214 --> 01:05:18,647
diary for sale.

2323
01:05:18,649 --> 01:05:20,015
The cost of cocaine rehab for a

2324
01:05:20,017 --> 01:05:23,318
month? $14,000.

2325
01:05:23,320 --> 01:05:24,586
The cost of wall street banks

2326
01:05:24,588 --> 01:05:25,987
trying to ruin the reputation of

2327
01:05:25,989 --> 01:05:27,155
a man who has served the

2328
01:05:27,157 --> 01:05:28,256
commonwealth of Kentucky his

2329
01:05:28,258 --> 01:05:31,726
entire adult life: Priceless.

2330
01:05:31,728 --> 01:05:33,828
- Booyah, motherfucker!

2331
01:05:33,830 --> 01:05:35,597
- I owe you, man!

2332
01:05:35,599 --> 01:05:36,598
But you better get your ass

2333
01:05:36,600 --> 01:05:37,799
outta dodge.

2334
01:05:37,801 --> 01:05:38,667
- Hey, next time you think

2335
01:05:38,669 --> 01:05:39,567
about running for office,

2336
01:05:39,569 --> 01:05:40,835
try France.

2337
01:05:40,837 --> 01:05:41,970
It's a better fit.

2338
01:05:41,972 --> 01:05:42,671
<i-> Well, merci

2339
01:05:42,673 --> 01:05:44,706
<i>beaucoup.</i>

2340
01:05:44,708 --> 01:05:46,441
- Taxi'll be here in five.

2341
01:05:46,443 --> 01:05:47,275
So you also have the--

2342
01:05:47,277 --> 01:05:49,344
- Paul.

2343
01:05:58,421 --> 01:05:59,587
You son of a bitch.

2344
01:05:59,589 --> 01:06:02,590
I can't fucking believe it.

2345
01:06:02,592 --> 01:06:04,726
Here.

2346
01:06:10,633 --> 01:06:11,866
When you graduated law school,

2347
01:06:11,868 --> 01:06:13,168
you know where I was, right?

2348
01:06:13,170 --> 01:06:13,969
- Sure.

2349
01:06:13,971 --> 01:06:15,570
You were two years behind me.

2350
01:06:15,572 --> 01:06:16,738
- Right, in the same class with

2351
01:06:16,740 --> 01:06:18,740
your favorite pal.

2352
01:06:18,742 --> 01:06:19,407
I gotta tell you,

2353
01:06:19,409 --> 01:06:20,508
I have taken a lot.

2354
01:06:20,510 --> 01:06:22,577
- I know you have.

2355
01:06:22,579 --> 01:06:23,945
- I'm not sure you do.

2356
01:06:23,947 --> 01:06:25,613
My father was an artist who

2357
01:06:25,615 --> 01:06:26,648
struggled his whole life to

2358
01:06:26,650 --> 01:06:28,817
support us and he told me if I

2359
01:06:28,819 --> 01:06:30,585
worked hard, got good grades,

2360
01:06:30,587 --> 01:06:32,187
and got into Harvard, I could do

2361
01:06:32,189 --> 01:06:34,689
whatever I wanted.

2362
01:06:34,691 --> 01:06:35,523
Guess what I did when

2363
01:06:35,525 --> 01:06:36,758
I got there.

2364
01:06:36,760 --> 01:06:37,892
I fell for one Larry Lincoln

2365
01:06:37,894 --> 01:06:39,661
Becker, who dragged me back to

2366
01:06:39,663 --> 01:06:41,496
this godforsaken place.

2367
01:06:41,498 --> 01:06:42,897
- Godforsaken?

2368
01:06:42,899 --> 01:06:43,932
- If you grew up in Brooklyn,

2369
01:06:43,934 --> 01:06:46,134
absolutely.

2370
01:06:46,136 --> 01:06:46,968
You know, I've been a

2371
01:06:46,970 --> 01:06:48,636
I've done my stand-by-your man

2372
01:06:48,638 --> 01:06:50,005
thing for a guy who will fuck

2373
01:06:50,007 --> 01:06:52,807
anyone-- anything-- in a skirt.

2374
01:06:52,809 --> 01:06:53,942
Honestly, it must be so

2375
01:06:53,944 --> 01:06:54,976
confusing for him when those

2376
01:06:54,978 --> 01:06:56,544
Scottish bagpipers come here

2377
01:06:56,546 --> 01:06:57,812
to play.

2378
01:06:57,814 --> 01:06:58,980
But it was all between me and

2379
01:06:58,982 --> 01:07:00,582
him, but now you go ahead and

2380
01:07:00,584 --> 01:07:02,117
you drag this girl through

2381
01:07:02,119 --> 01:07:03,218
the mud.

2382
01:07:03,220 --> 01:07:04,786
A girl with her whole life ahead

2383
01:07:04,788 --> 01:07:05,787
of her?

2384
01:07:05,789 --> 01:07:06,788
Is that what it's come to?

2385
01:07:06,790 --> 01:07:07,922
- Hey, she did the coke.

2386
01:07:07,924 --> 01:07:08,723
- Big deal!

2387
01:07:08,725 --> 01:07:10,191
Half of America has done a line

2388
01:07:10,193 --> 01:07:11,393
once in their lives.

2389
01:07:11,395 --> 01:07:13,028
- And she wasn't raped.

2390
01:07:13,030 --> 01:07:14,162
She was a completely willing

2391
01:07:14,164 --> 01:07:14,896
participant. - Hardly.

2392
01:07:14,898 --> 01:07:15,930
- She knew what the score was.

2393
01:07:15,932 --> 01:07:17,932
- What the fuck, Paul?

2394
01:07:17,934 --> 01:07:19,434
Is it worth it?

2395
01:07:19,436 --> 01:07:20,301
- Let me tell you what

2396
01:07:20,303 --> 01:07:21,503
I'm doing.

2397
01:07:21,505 --> 01:07:23,905
I am playing to win, so that

2398
01:07:23,907 --> 01:07:25,707
your guy gets another

2399
01:07:25,709 --> 01:07:27,175
four years.

2400
01:07:27,177 --> 01:07:28,810
So that that asshole Perkins--

2401
01:07:28,812 --> 01:07:30,311
who is diametrically opposed to

2402
01:07:30,313 --> 01:07:32,080
every single issue that you care

2403
01:07:32,082 --> 01:07:33,381
about: Foreclosures,

2404
01:07:33,383 --> 01:07:35,717
minimum wage, clean air and who

2405
01:07:35,719 --> 01:07:37,085
doesn't so much as take a shit

2406
01:07:37,087 --> 01:07:38,553
without first having it stamped

2407
01:07:38,555 --> 01:07:39,988
and approved by wall street

2408
01:07:39,990 --> 01:07:41,523
banks and the mega-mining and

2409
01:07:41,525 --> 01:07:42,457
health care industries--

2410
01:07:42,459 --> 01:07:43,291
doesn't get to sit where

2411
01:07:43,293 --> 01:07:44,993
Larry sits.

2412
01:07:44,995 --> 01:07:46,027
- And doesn't it bother you?

2413
01:07:46,029 --> 01:07:47,996
The way you get there?

2414
01:07:51,834 --> 01:07:53,902
It's just you and me here, Paul.

2415
01:08:15,691 --> 01:08:16,458
- Thought you'd never make

2416
01:08:16,460 --> 01:08:19,360
it home. - Hi. - Hi.

2417
01:08:19,362 --> 01:08:20,662
- Is that more Kentucky stuff?

2418
01:08:20,664 --> 01:08:21,863
- No.

2419
01:08:21,865 --> 01:08:23,932
Penelope's petitions.

2420
01:08:23,934 --> 01:08:25,200
And they're not just petitions.

2421
01:08:25,202 --> 01:08:26,201
I mean, they are, but there's

2422
01:08:26,203 --> 01:08:27,502
also notes on them.

2423
01:08:27,504 --> 01:08:28,603
- Oh, boy.

2424
01:08:28,605 --> 01:08:30,071
- For example: "Best doctor

2425
01:08:30,073 --> 01:08:31,272
I ever had."

2426
01:08:31,274 --> 01:08:32,640
"Yes," followed by four

2427
01:08:32,642 --> 01:08:34,375
exclamation points.

2428
01:08:34,377 --> 01:08:36,711
"I wish I could sign 10 times,

2429
01:08:36,713 --> 01:08:37,879
because you are going to be 10

2430
01:08:37,881 --> 01:08:39,581
times better than what we got."

2431
01:08:39,583 --> 01:08:40,582
- And 10 times as likely to

2432
01:08:40,584 --> 01:08:41,783
get slaughtered.

2433
01:08:41,785 --> 01:08:44,819
- Why not Penelope?

2434
01:08:44,821 --> 01:08:46,488
There's 101 reasons why she

2435
01:08:46,490 --> 01:08:47,555
can't win.

2436
01:08:47,557 --> 01:08:50,091
- Yeah, I know.

2437
01:08:50,093 --> 01:08:50,925
And they're all really good

2438
01:08:50,927 --> 01:08:52,093
ones, but I just feel like if

2439
01:08:52,095 --> 01:08:53,995
she won, this world would be a

2440
01:08:53,997 --> 01:08:57,532
better place.

2441
01:08:57,534 --> 01:09:00,802
Not so?

2442
01:09:00,804 --> 01:09:02,871
No?

2443
01:09:16,085 --> 01:09:16,918
- I didn't know you were

2444
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:18,186
in town.

2445
01:09:18,188 --> 01:09:19,187
- Can I talk to you for

2446
01:09:19,189 --> 01:09:19,854
a minute?

2447
01:09:19,856 --> 01:09:24,859
- Yeah, sure.

2448
01:09:24,861 --> 01:09:26,794
Look, I know that you're still

2449
01:09:26,796 --> 01:09:29,597
upset about Helena, but...

2450
01:09:29,599 --> 01:09:31,566
This is what happens.

2451
01:09:31,568 --> 01:09:33,001
- Paul, Helena tried to

2452
01:09:33,003 --> 01:09:35,303
commit suicide.

2453
01:09:35,305 --> 01:09:36,604
She took a container full of

2454
01:09:36,606 --> 01:09:39,707
pills, but her mother found her.

2455
01:09:39,709 --> 01:09:42,243
It happened over the weekend.

2456
01:09:42,245 --> 01:09:43,111
They're keeping it quiet.

2457
01:09:43,113 --> 01:09:44,045
It's not in the media

2458
01:09:44,047 --> 01:09:45,780
and won't be.

2459
01:09:45,782 --> 01:09:47,081
But her mother called

2460
01:09:47,083 --> 01:09:47,782
to tell me.

2461
01:09:47,784 --> 01:09:49,984
And I thought you should

2462
01:09:49,986 --> 01:09:51,119
know too.

2463
01:10:03,599 --> 01:10:08,469
- I had no idea it would...

2464
01:10:08,471 --> 01:10:10,004
I didn't think it would play

2465
01:10:10,006 --> 01:10:15,743
like this.

2466
01:10:15,745 --> 01:10:17,545
- This is what happens.

2467
01:10:21,985 --> 01:10:23,251
- Professor St. John, this is

2468
01:10:23,253 --> 01:10:26,254
Paul Turner calling again, um,

2469
01:10:26,256 --> 01:10:27,589
I know it's a hard time for you

2470
01:10:27,591 --> 01:10:29,190
and your family, but if you

2471
01:10:29,192 --> 01:10:30,425
could give me a call at the

2472
01:10:30,427 --> 01:10:31,693
number that I left earlier,

2473
01:10:31,695 --> 01:10:34,562
that... that would be great.

2474
01:10:34,564 --> 01:10:36,631
Thank you.

2475
01:10:45,674 --> 01:10:46,507
Hello, Helena.

2476
01:10:46,509 --> 01:10:48,276
It's Paul Turner calling again.

2477
01:10:48,278 --> 01:10:50,745
Um, look, if you'd like me to

2478
01:10:50,747 --> 01:10:52,780
stop calling you, just text me

2479
01:10:52,782 --> 01:10:55,617
and I will.

2480
01:10:55,619 --> 01:10:57,318
O.K., thanks.

2481
01:11:22,811 --> 01:11:23,778
- Please, I just need five

2482
01:11:23,780 --> 01:11:26,314
minutes of your time.

2483
01:11:26,316 --> 01:11:27,982
Ple-- five minutes and I will go

2484
01:11:27,984 --> 01:11:29,717
home, I promise.

2485
01:11:29,719 --> 01:11:31,886
Please.

2486
01:11:31,888 --> 01:11:33,121
I can't begin to tell you how

2487
01:11:33,123 --> 01:11:35,056
sorry I am.

2488
01:11:35,058 --> 01:11:37,292
We never should have done it.

2489
01:11:37,294 --> 01:11:40,194
I never should have done it.

2490
01:11:40,196 --> 01:11:44,932
- But you did.

2491
01:11:44,934 --> 01:11:47,769
Why?

2492
01:11:47,771 --> 01:11:50,538
Why me?

2493
01:11:50,540 --> 01:11:54,275
- I dunno.

2494
01:11:54,277 --> 01:11:59,480
No... I do know.

2495
01:11:59,482 --> 01:12:03,151
What we do is like a military

2496
01:12:03,153 --> 01:12:05,787
guy in Virginia piloting a drone

2497
01:12:05,789 --> 01:12:07,121
over Afghanistan and launching

2498
01:12:07,123 --> 01:12:08,423
a missile.

2499
01:12:08,425 --> 01:12:10,725
It seems like a video game and

2500
01:12:10,727 --> 01:12:11,459
there aren't real people

2501
01:12:11,461 --> 01:12:13,628
involved, and you hit the fire

2502
01:12:13,630 --> 01:12:15,029
button and you're thinking,

2503
01:12:15,031 --> 01:12:15,697
"how'd we do?

2504
01:12:15,699 --> 01:12:16,898
Did we hit it?"

2505
01:12:16,900 --> 01:12:18,399
And sometimes we hit the target,

2506
01:12:18,401 --> 01:12:22,270
and other times...

2507
01:12:22,272 --> 01:12:23,304
We destroy the building with the

2508
01:12:23,306 --> 01:12:27,141
red cross painted on the top.

2509
01:12:27,143 --> 01:12:30,712
- It's not right.

2510
01:12:30,714 --> 01:12:34,282
It's so not right.

2511
01:12:34,284 --> 01:12:35,616
For years, after a bad day at

2512
01:12:35,618 --> 01:12:38,386
school, I'd jump on that

2513
01:12:38,388 --> 01:12:42,323
trampoline.

2514
01:12:42,325 --> 01:12:45,026
And I'd feel better, feel like I

2515
01:12:45,028 --> 01:12:49,564
was free, floating in space.

2516
01:12:49,566 --> 01:12:50,732
But at some point, my mom would

2517
01:12:50,734 --> 01:12:51,899
come out and tell me that I

2518
01:12:51,901 --> 01:12:55,236
couldn't stay here all night.

2519
01:12:55,238 --> 01:12:56,404
The last thing that I wanted

2520
01:12:56,406 --> 01:13:00,007
was to come back to earth.

2521
01:13:00,009 --> 01:13:02,677
- And this is a big dose of

2522
01:13:02,679 --> 01:13:04,879
coming back down to earth.

2523
01:13:04,881 --> 01:13:10,485
- Giant dose.

2524
01:13:10,487 --> 01:13:11,519
And my dad teaches power

2525
01:13:11,521 --> 01:13:13,388
and politics.

2526
01:13:13,390 --> 01:13:15,790
I should've known.

2527
01:13:15,792 --> 01:13:16,491
- No. Nobody really

2528
01:13:16,493 --> 01:13:19,894
understands power.

2529
01:13:19,896 --> 01:13:21,062
I think that's why we all abuse

2530
01:13:21,064 --> 01:13:24,165
it so easily.

2531
01:13:24,167 --> 01:13:25,032
- I'm sorry, but that's just

2532
01:13:25,034 --> 01:13:28,102
not good enough.

2533
01:13:28,104 --> 01:13:33,007
Actions have consequences.

2534
01:13:33,009 --> 01:13:35,543
And I think you do understand.

2535
01:13:51,460 --> 01:13:53,261
- Hey.

2536
01:13:53,263 --> 01:13:54,862
You know better than that.

2537
01:13:54,864 --> 01:14:00,134
- Oh, yes, I do.

2538
01:14:37,607 --> 01:14:39,106
Foreclosure stats and we're

2539
01:14:39,108 --> 01:14:40,408
cutting the spot now.

2540
01:14:40,410 --> 01:14:43,044
- Good... where's the big guy?

2541
01:14:43,046 --> 01:14:45,279
- You got me.

2542
01:14:45,281 --> 01:14:46,614
- What's he doing, hiking the

2543
01:14:46,616 --> 01:14:48,182
appalachian trail?

2544
01:14:48,184 --> 01:14:50,051
- Yeah, something like that.

2545
01:14:50,053 --> 01:14:51,052
- We're talking about the most

2546
01:14:51,054 --> 01:14:52,220
electronically connected dude on

2547
01:14:52,222 --> 01:14:53,387
the planet.

2548
01:14:53,389 --> 01:14:55,756
Where the hell is he?

2549
01:14:55,758 --> 01:14:59,227
- I have no idea.

2550
01:14:59,229 --> 01:15:00,795
...hi, I'm so sorry for calling

2551
01:15:00,797 --> 01:15:02,230
you so many times and I know

2552
01:15:02,232 --> 01:15:03,231
you're really busy and I called

2553
01:15:03,233 --> 01:15:04,465
you yesterday.

2554
01:15:04,467 --> 01:15:05,800
- It's fine, really.

2555
01:15:05,802 --> 01:15:07,101
- Um, you haven't heard from

2556
01:15:07,103 --> 01:15:08,870
him yet, have you?

2557
01:15:08,872 --> 01:15:10,037
- I haven't, but if I do I'll

2558
01:15:10,039 --> 01:15:11,372
call you or text you.

2559
01:15:11,374 --> 01:15:12,440
Are you O.K.?

2560
01:15:12,442 --> 01:15:14,642
- Just a little worried.

2561
01:15:14,644 --> 01:15:15,843
- Well, I'll let you know

2562
01:15:15,845 --> 01:15:16,644
if I do.

2563
01:15:16,646 --> 01:15:22,483
O.K., bye.

2564
01:15:22,485 --> 01:15:25,386
- I think you need a shot.

2565
01:15:25,388 --> 01:15:26,721
- That's my line.

2566
01:15:27,891 --> 01:15:28,723
- This is what you're up

2567
01:15:28,725 --> 01:15:29,724
against.

2568
01:15:29,726 --> 01:15:32,059
Trip Simmons: Internet tycoon

2569
01:15:32,061 --> 01:15:33,828
who, after two grueling months

2570
01:15:33,830 --> 01:15:35,796
teaching, is running as a public

2571
01:15:35,798 --> 01:15:37,298
school teacher, albeit a public

2572
01:15:37,300 --> 01:15:38,466
school teacher willing to spend

2573
01:15:38,468 --> 01:15:41,335
$45 million, 95% of which is

2574
01:15:41,337 --> 01:15:42,336
his own money.

2575
01:15:42,338 --> 01:15:43,504
- Serious stuff.

2576
01:15:43,506 --> 01:15:45,339
- If you happen to get past him

2577
01:15:45,341 --> 01:15:46,507
in the primary, and that is a

2578
01:15:46,509 --> 01:15:48,276
gigantic "if," this is who you

2579
01:15:48,278 --> 01:15:49,777
will face: Hammering Hank

2580
01:15:49,779 --> 01:15:51,379
Harrison, beloved television

2581
01:15:51,381 --> 01:15:53,681
star and tea party hero, who is

2582
01:15:53,683 --> 01:15:55,016
running as the outsider in this

2583
01:15:55,018 --> 01:15:56,484
race in spite of having

2584
01:15:56,486 --> 01:15:58,953
$65 million already in the bank

2585
01:15:58,955 --> 01:16:00,254
and off-the-charts name

2586
01:16:00,256 --> 01:16:01,355
recognition.

2587
01:16:01,357 --> 01:16:02,790
- And what do we have?

2588
01:16:02,792 --> 01:16:03,824
- You.

2589
01:16:03,826 --> 01:16:06,861
- I'm flattered.

2590
01:16:06,863 --> 01:16:08,729
But anything else?

2591
01:16:08,731 --> 01:16:10,898
- Us.

2592
01:16:10,900 --> 01:16:11,599
- Are you sure you're

2593
01:16:11,601 --> 01:16:12,300
up for this?

2594
01:16:12,302 --> 01:16:13,935
No more appalachian trail

2595
01:16:13,937 --> 01:16:15,336
walkabouts?

2596
01:16:15,338 --> 01:16:16,737
- You know, I actually was on

2597
01:16:16,739 --> 01:16:18,706
the appalachian trail in Maine.

2598
01:16:18,708 --> 01:16:20,875
- Well, welcome home.

2599
01:16:20,877 --> 01:16:22,176
- So, Jimmy is going to be

2600
01:16:22,178 --> 01:16:24,078
following you around 24/7.

2601
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:25,179
He's going to be filming you.

2602
01:16:25,181 --> 01:16:26,347
We'll cut together some spots

2603
01:16:26,349 --> 01:16:27,682
about who you are, what you're

2604
01:16:27,684 --> 01:16:28,683
about, your commitment to

2605
01:16:28,685 --> 01:16:30,451
service, your dedication to this

2606
01:16:30,453 --> 01:16:32,286
office, that kind of thing.

2607
01:16:32,288 --> 01:16:33,287
- And people are going to want

2608
01:16:33,289 --> 01:16:34,722
to see this?

2609
01:16:34,724 --> 01:16:36,691
- We can only hope.

2610
01:16:36,693 --> 01:16:39,026
- Thank you.

2611
01:16:39,028 --> 01:16:41,529
Thank you so much.

2612
01:16:41,531 --> 01:16:42,563
...in the words of the great

2613
01:16:42,565 --> 01:16:44,732
Hubert Humphrey, "I am proud to

2614
01:16:44,734 --> 01:16:46,968
be here today to represent the

2615
01:16:46,970 --> 01:16:48,369
people who don't always

2616
01:16:48,371 --> 01:16:49,737
have a voice."

2617
01:16:49,739 --> 01:16:51,606
Those in the dawn of life,

2618
01:16:51,608 --> 01:16:53,341
our children; Those in the

2619
01:16:53,343 --> 01:16:56,243
shadows of life, our poor,

2620
01:16:56,245 --> 01:16:57,912
and those in the dusk of life,

2621
01:16:57,914 --> 01:16:59,547
our elderly.

2622
01:16:59,549 --> 01:17:01,382
I am proud to be here on behalf

2623
01:17:01,384 --> 01:17:03,084
of those who work to make

2624
01:17:03,086 --> 01:17:04,785
California work.

2625
01:17:04,787 --> 01:17:06,287
The people who build our houses,

2626
01:17:06,289 --> 01:17:08,189
teach our children, care for our

2627
01:17:08,191 --> 01:17:09,991
sick, put out the fires,

2628
01:17:09,993 --> 01:17:11,592
protect our streets, cook our

2629
01:17:11,594 --> 01:17:13,728
food, pick our fruit, drive the

2630
01:17:13,730 --> 01:17:16,464
trucks and clean our offices.

2631
01:17:16,466 --> 01:17:18,599
I am here because we are all in

2632
01:17:18,601 --> 01:17:20,101
this together when it comes to

2633
01:17:20,103 --> 01:17:21,836
standing tall and standing

2634
01:17:21,838 --> 01:17:23,671
strong to fight for the

2635
01:17:23,673 --> 01:17:25,239
California dream.

2636
01:17:25,241 --> 01:17:26,507
- Field poll.

2637
01:17:26,509 --> 01:17:28,009
- Where are we?

2638
01:17:28,011 --> 01:17:29,176
- Still in the single digits,

2639
01:17:29,178 --> 01:17:31,812
six percent. 
- Oy.

2640
01:17:31,814 --> 01:17:34,382
- Oh, there's still time.

2641
01:17:34,384 --> 01:17:35,816
- While they will protect wall

2642
01:17:35,818 --> 01:17:38,185
street banks and lower taxes for

2643
01:17:38,187 --> 01:17:40,521
corporations and millionaires,

2644
01:17:40,523 --> 01:17:43,190
we will fight for jobs.

2645
01:17:43,192 --> 01:17:44,025
- Can you do that again,

2646
01:17:44,027 --> 01:17:44,892
but really emphasize, "we will

2647
01:17:44,894 --> 01:17:46,560
<i>fight for jobs"?</i>

2648
01:17:46,562 --> 01:17:47,862
- While they will protect wall

2649
01:17:47,864 --> 01:17:49,897
street banks and lower taxes for

2650
01:17:49,899 --> 01:17:51,932
corporations and millionaires,

2651
01:17:51,934 --> 01:17:54,068
we will fight for jobs.

2652
01:17:54,070 --> 01:17:55,002
And while they will complain

2653
01:17:55,004 --> 01:17:57,204
about what is wrong in America,

2654
01:17:57,206 --> 01:17:59,240
we will focus on what is right

2655
01:17:59,242 --> 01:18:00,241
in America.

2656
01:18:00,243 --> 01:18:02,410
Today, our party, which has

2657
01:18:02,412 --> 01:18:04,278
saved this nation from

2658
01:18:04,280 --> 01:18:06,047
depression, from fascism,

2659
01:18:06,049 --> 01:18:08,149
from racism, from corruption,

2660
01:18:08,151 --> 01:18:09,717
is called upon to do it again.

2661
01:18:09,719 --> 01:18:10,885
This time to save the state from

2662
01:18:10,887 --> 01:18:12,987
confusion and division, from the

2663
01:18:12,989 --> 01:18:14,722
threat of eventual fiscal

2664
01:18:14,724 --> 01:18:17,291
disaster and from those who lack

2665
01:18:17,293 --> 01:18:19,927
the courage and vision to

2666
01:18:19,929 --> 01:18:22,430
understand that we are all in

2667
01:18:22,432 --> 01:18:24,699
this together.

2668
01:18:24,701 --> 01:18:26,300
- A little higher.

2669
01:18:26,302 --> 01:18:29,070
Yeah, up... yep.

2670
01:18:29,072 --> 01:18:29,970
- Now how is it?

2671
01:18:29,972 --> 01:18:32,440
- Perfect!

2672
01:18:32,442 --> 01:18:34,475
- What do you think?

2673
01:18:34,477 --> 01:18:35,910
- I think it's gonna be a knife

2674
01:18:35,912 --> 01:18:37,378
fight in a phone booth.

2675
01:18:43,853 --> 01:18:46,887
- Protein shakes.

2676
01:18:46,889 --> 01:18:47,955
- Are you sure you're gay?

2677
01:18:47,957 --> 01:18:49,657
- Nope.

2678
01:18:49,659 --> 01:18:50,825
- Then what the hell am I doing

2679
01:18:50,827 --> 01:18:51,492
with peaches?

2680
01:18:51,494 --> 01:18:53,094
- Peaches?

2681
01:18:53,096 --> 01:18:54,095
Peaches?

2682
01:18:54,097 --> 01:18:57,465
Is this a thing or a fling?

2683
01:18:57,467 --> 01:18:58,566
- We need her.

2684
01:18:58,568 --> 01:18:59,834
- We need her?

2685
01:18:59,836 --> 01:19:01,001
What if I told you I was

2686
01:19:01,003 --> 01:19:01,769
screwing some hair product

2687
01:19:01,771 --> 01:19:03,637
reporter because we needed him?

2688
01:19:03,639 --> 01:19:05,606
What would you say?

2689
01:19:05,608 --> 01:19:07,374
- Is he local or national?

2690
01:19:07,376 --> 01:19:08,542
- You would not!

2691
01:19:14,817 --> 01:19:16,217
What?

2692
01:19:16,219 --> 01:19:17,818
- You gotta get here now!

2693
01:19:17,820 --> 01:19:18,819
- No, we'll be there, we'll be

2694
01:19:18,821 --> 01:19:19,820
there in less than five.

2695
01:19:19,822 --> 01:19:20,654
We're in the mission now,

2696
01:19:20,656 --> 01:19:21,322
we're on our way.

2697
01:19:23,359 --> 01:19:24,358
- You're going to give them to

2698
01:19:24,360 --> 01:19:25,025
me now, huh?

2699
01:19:25,027 --> 01:19:25,860
You're going to give me

2700
01:19:25,862 --> 01:19:27,528
'cause I will cut your fucking

2701
01:19:27,530 --> 01:19:28,562
throat, little girl.

2702
01:19:28,564 --> 01:19:29,930
- Excuse me, excuse me!

2703
01:19:29,932 --> 01:19:31,565
Hey, hey!

2704
01:19:31,567 --> 01:19:32,733
- You gonna give 'em to me now,

2705
01:19:32,735 --> 01:19:33,400
little girl, huh?

2706
01:19:33,402 --> 01:19:34,068
- Put it down, stop!

2707
01:19:34,070 --> 01:19:34,735
Ah!

2708
01:19:34,737 --> 01:19:35,770
- You too, Penelope?

2709
01:19:35,772 --> 01:19:37,404
You going to fucking dis me too?

2710
01:19:37,406 --> 01:19:38,172
Huh?

2711
01:19:38,174 --> 01:19:39,406
Fucking dis me too!

2712
01:19:39,408 --> 01:19:44,245
- Hey, Tommy, Tommy, marisol is

2713
01:19:44,247 --> 01:19:45,279
one of the sweetest,

2714
01:19:45,281 --> 01:19:47,047
nicest people I have ever met.

2715
01:19:47,049 --> 01:19:48,282
She would never intentionally

2716
01:19:48,284 --> 01:19:49,016
disrespect you.

2717
01:19:49,018 --> 01:19:50,084
And you know that, right?

2718
01:19:50,086 --> 01:19:50,751
- It's not true.

2719
01:19:50,753 --> 01:19:51,485
- No, never.

2720
01:19:51,487 --> 01:19:52,653
We don't even have the pills you

2721
01:19:52,655 --> 01:19:53,587
want, Tommy.

2722
01:19:53,589 --> 01:19:56,423
- O.K., Tommy.

2723
01:19:56,425 --> 01:19:57,525
Give me the knife, O.K.?

2724
01:19:57,527 --> 01:19:58,192
Please.

2725
01:19:58,194 --> 01:19:59,326
- No, I need my meds.

2726
01:19:59,328 --> 01:20:00,761
- I know.

2727
01:20:00,763 --> 01:20:01,462
Give me the knife.

2728
01:20:01,464 --> 01:20:02,296
Give me the knife, Tommy.

2729
01:20:02,298 --> 01:20:03,998
Please.

2730
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:05,166
Give me the knife.

2731
01:20:05,168 --> 01:20:07,067
- No!

2732
01:20:07,069 --> 01:20:08,636
- Give me the knife.

2733
01:20:08,638 --> 01:20:10,237
- I can't.

2734
01:20:10,239 --> 01:20:11,372
- Please.

2735
01:20:11,374 --> 01:20:16,944
Give me the knife.

2736
01:20:16,946 --> 01:20:18,913
- I need my meds, Penelope!

2737
01:20:18,915 --> 01:20:20,181
My meds, Penelope.

2738
01:20:21,150 --> 01:20:21,816
- Are you O.K.?

2739
01:20:21,818 --> 01:20:22,583
- Yeah.

2740
01:20:22,585 --> 01:20:23,450
- We should get you

2741
01:20:23,452 --> 01:20:24,718
back inside.

2742
01:20:24,720 --> 01:20:27,221
- Holy... shit.

2743
01:20:34,997 --> 01:20:36,397
- I'm glad you're O.K.

2744
01:20:36,399 --> 01:20:37,064
- I'm fine.

2745
01:20:37,066 --> 01:20:38,833
- I'm glad.

2746
01:20:41,003 --> 01:20:44,471
I'm, um, so sorry.

2747
01:20:44,473 --> 01:20:46,106
Really, really, sorry, you know?

2748
01:20:46,108 --> 01:20:47,041
- Don't be sorry.

2749
01:20:47,043 --> 01:20:47,875
No, we're just glad that

2750
01:20:47,877 --> 01:20:48,876
everyone's O.K. And that Jimmy

2751
01:20:48,878 --> 01:20:49,543
called us.

2752
01:20:49,545 --> 01:20:50,911
- Yeah, I mean, you were

2753
01:20:50,913 --> 01:20:51,846
amazing out there.

2754
01:20:51,848 --> 01:20:53,013
- Yeah. 
- Incredible.

2755
01:20:53,015 --> 01:20:53,714
- No, no.

2756
01:20:53,716 --> 01:20:54,715
You see one of the biggest

2757
01:20:54,717 --> 01:20:56,517
cliches about this neighborhood.

2758
01:20:56,519 --> 01:20:57,785
Normally it's not like this,

2759
01:20:57,787 --> 01:21:02,389
really.

2760
01:21:02,391 --> 01:21:04,925
You're probably right.

2761
01:21:04,927 --> 01:21:06,627
If I can't even control my own

2762
01:21:06,629 --> 01:21:08,429
little space, how can I control

2763
01:21:08,431 --> 01:21:09,930
an entire state?

2764
01:21:09,932 --> 01:21:13,334
Right?

2765
01:21:24,847 --> 01:21:25,679
- So this is what you've

2766
01:21:25,681 --> 01:21:27,014
wrought: Facebook likes,

2767
01:21:27,016 --> 01:21:28,883
1.2 million and counting.

2768
01:21:28,885 --> 01:21:29,984
Number of YouTube views of you

2769
01:21:29,986 --> 01:21:30,985
taking the knife away from the

2770
01:21:30,987 --> 01:21:35,723
crazy person: 4,318,000.

2771
01:21:35,725 --> 01:21:36,790
- And counting.

2772
01:21:36,792 --> 01:21:37,892
And watch this.

2773
01:21:37,894 --> 01:21:38,659
- She's awesome.

2774
01:21:38,661 --> 01:21:40,561
She's really inspiring.

2775
01:21:40,563 --> 01:21:41,929
- That lady is definitely

2776
01:21:41,931 --> 01:21:43,197
walking the walk.

2777
01:21:43,199 --> 01:21:44,732
- O.K., you cannot take that

2778
01:21:44,734 --> 01:21:47,034
bandage off until the election.

2779
01:21:47,036 --> 01:21:48,068
- It's been almost two weeks,

2780
01:21:48,070 --> 01:21:48,802
I think it's time.

2781
01:21:48,804 --> 01:21:50,671
You've got to give me at least

2782
01:21:50,673 --> 01:21:51,338
another month.

2783
01:21:51,340 --> 01:21:52,172
- I'll give you a week.

2784
01:21:52,174 --> 01:21:53,540
- Sold.

2785
01:21:53,542 --> 01:21:54,808
- What the fuck?

2786
01:21:54,810 --> 01:21:56,543
- What?

2787
01:21:56,545 --> 01:21:58,746
- Check it out.

2788
01:21:58,748 --> 01:21:59,613
- Helping the homeless is

2789
01:21:59,615 --> 01:22:01,482
nothing new for San Francisco.

2790
01:22:01,484 --> 01:22:02,816
We have a long history of it in

2791
01:22:02,818 --> 01:22:03,517
our city.

2792
01:22:03,519 --> 01:22:04,818
But what is new is a program

2793
01:22:04,820 --> 01:22:06,587
one of the volunteers here

2794
01:22:06,589 --> 01:22:07,821
has started.

2795
01:22:07,823 --> 01:22:08,756
- Exhale.

2796
01:22:10,393 --> 01:22:13,327
- Ahh!

2797
01:22:13,329 --> 01:22:14,828
- Tawny Shearson is

2798
01:22:14,830 --> 01:22:16,697
no ordinary volunteer. 
- Out.

2799
01:22:16,699 --> 01:22:17,531
- She has started a

2800
01:22:17,533 --> 01:22:19,033
special program for San

2801
01:22:19,035 --> 01:22:21,001
Francisco's homeless children.

2802
01:22:21,003 --> 01:22:22,803
- Well, the idea is why should

2803
01:22:22,805 --> 01:22:23,971
only rich children get all the

2804
01:22:23,973 --> 01:22:25,606
amazing benefits of yoga?

2805
01:22:25,608 --> 01:22:26,774
These kids love it!

2806
01:22:26,776 --> 01:22:28,275
They can't get enough of it.

2807
01:22:28,277 --> 01:22:30,010
And honestly, I can't get enough

2808
01:22:30,012 --> 01:22:32,246
teaching them.

2809
01:22:32,248 --> 01:22:33,948
- Tawny Shearson, a woman truly

2810
01:22:33,950 --> 01:22:35,416
making a difference for those

2811
01:22:35,418 --> 01:22:36,684
who need it most.

2812
01:22:36,686 --> 01:22:38,752
Rick Sanchez, KXSF news,

2813
01:22:38,754 --> 01:22:40,154
at Saint Mary's church in

2814
01:22:40,156 --> 01:22:42,089
the tenderloin.

2815
01:22:42,091 --> 01:22:43,090
- O.K., so when she's not

2816
01:22:43,092 --> 01:22:43,891
blackmailing us, she's running

2817
01:22:43,893 --> 01:22:44,792
for Saint?

2818
01:22:44,794 --> 01:22:46,327
- Those guys are good.

2819
01:22:46,329 --> 01:22:47,928
- Mandy Denton behind this?

2820
01:22:47,930 --> 01:22:48,963
- 100%.

2821
01:22:48,965 --> 01:22:50,364
And we violated the number one

2822
01:22:50,366 --> 01:22:51,699
commandment in politics-- we had

2823
01:22:51,701 --> 01:22:53,634
her down and we did not put

2824
01:22:53,636 --> 01:22:56,236
in the shiv.

2825
01:22:56,238 --> 01:22:57,237
...all right, when you think of

2826
01:22:57,239 --> 01:22:58,072
family, what are the first

2827
01:22:58,074 --> 01:22:59,573
- Love, protection,

2828
01:22:59,575 --> 01:23:00,975
warmth.
- Security, fun.

2829
01:23:00,977 --> 01:23:01,775
- Caring.

2830
01:23:01,777 --> 01:23:02,710
A bond, support.

2831
01:23:02,712 --> 01:23:03,677
- Strength as a unit.

2832
01:23:03,679 --> 01:23:04,411
Shelter.

2833
01:23:04,413 --> 01:23:05,245
- That's good.

2834
01:23:05,247 --> 01:23:06,213
When we get back-- incoming.

2835
01:23:06,215 --> 01:23:07,214
- Penelope Nelson

2836
01:23:07,216 --> 01:23:08,182
runs this clinic.

2837
01:23:08,184 --> 01:23:10,017
The same Penelope Nelson who

2838
01:23:10,019 --> 01:23:11,552
claims she's qualified to be

2839
01:23:11,554 --> 01:23:13,087
your governor.

2840
01:23:13,089 --> 01:23:15,489
What she doesn't tell you is 28%

2841
01:23:15,491 --> 01:23:17,257
of those who come here are not

2842
01:23:17,259 --> 01:23:20,828
Americans, but illegal aliens.

2843
01:23:20,830 --> 01:23:22,930
And it's all funded by you.

2844
01:23:22,932 --> 01:23:24,465
You pay far too much in taxes

2845
01:23:24,467 --> 01:23:26,100
already so that Penelope can

2846
01:23:26,102 --> 01:23:28,902
spend your money on illegals?

2847
01:23:28,904 --> 01:23:30,104
You work hard, you play by the

2848
01:23:30,106 --> 01:23:32,172
rules, why doesn't she?

2849
01:23:32,174 --> 01:23:34,575
Hank Harrison-- let's make

2850
01:23:34,577 --> 01:23:36,477
California great again.

2851
01:23:36,479 --> 01:23:37,878
- I'm Hank Harrison and with

2852
01:23:37,880 --> 01:23:39,146
your help, we can take back

2853
01:23:39,148 --> 01:23:40,147
our government.

2854
01:23:41,283 --> 01:23:42,149
- That's good.

2855
01:23:42,151 --> 01:23:43,550
- Now it's really incoming.

2856
01:23:43,552 --> 01:23:46,553
Tawny's lawyer.

2857
01:23:46,555 --> 01:23:48,055
- Erik the red has scheduled a

2858
01:23:48,057 --> 01:23:49,456
press conference with tawny

2859
01:23:49,458 --> 01:23:50,958
tomorrow at six.

2860
01:23:50,960 --> 01:23:51,959
- He'll call it off if we

2861
01:23:51,961 --> 01:23:53,360
deliver him $2 million tomorrow

2862
01:23:53,362 --> 01:23:54,228
at four.

2863
01:23:54,230 --> 01:23:55,095
- Down a million.

2864
01:23:55,097 --> 01:23:55,863
- It's still blackmail.

2865
01:23:55,865 --> 01:23:56,797
- And the answer is still--

2866
01:23:56,799 --> 01:23:57,931
- no fucking way!

2867
01:23:57,933 --> 01:23:58,665
- Good, good.

2868
01:23:58,667 --> 01:23:59,533
O.K.

2869
01:23:59,535 --> 01:24:01,268
Good, O.K.

2870
01:24:01,270 --> 01:24:02,336
All right.

2871
01:24:02,338 --> 01:24:05,339
First, tawny has a story, but so

2872
01:24:05,341 --> 01:24:06,974
does peaches and her new

2873
01:24:06,976 --> 01:24:08,709
BFF, Angela.

2874
01:24:08,711 --> 01:24:10,044
How is that going?

2875
01:24:10,046 --> 01:24:11,645
- All set. 
- Good.

2876
01:24:11,647 --> 01:24:12,913
And second, starting on the

2877
01:24:12,915 --> 01:24:13,881
five o'clock news, we're

2878
01:24:13,883 --> 01:24:15,249
launching a saturation buy of

2879
01:24:15,251 --> 01:24:16,850
the downed helicopter spot with

2880
01:24:16,852 --> 01:24:17,651
your war buddy.

2881
01:24:17,653 --> 01:24:19,753
Three, we are making your name

2882
01:24:19,755 --> 01:24:20,921
and the word "family"

2883
01:24:20,923 --> 01:24:22,189
synonymous.

2884
01:24:22,191 --> 01:24:23,490
Think Stephen green,

2885
01:24:23,492 --> 01:24:24,892
think family.

2886
01:24:24,894 --> 01:24:25,726
- Take all the things that

2887
01:24:25,728 --> 01:24:27,127
family means and go from there.

2888
01:24:27,129 --> 01:24:28,829
Like love, warmth, strength,

2889
01:24:28,831 --> 01:24:31,031
protection, support, caring.

2890
01:24:31,033 --> 01:24:32,032
- And with each one of those,

2891
01:24:32,034 --> 01:24:33,167
we do a photo and message

2892
01:24:33,169 --> 01:24:34,535
of the day.

2893
01:24:34,537 --> 01:24:35,602
- Like what?

2894
01:24:35,604 --> 01:24:36,970
- Well, let's start with the

2895
01:24:36,972 --> 01:24:38,605
last one on the list: Caring.

2896
01:24:38,607 --> 01:24:39,573
As in caring for your

2897
01:24:39,575 --> 01:24:40,941
children's future.

2898
01:24:40,943 --> 01:24:42,009
We've worked something up around

2899
01:24:42,011 --> 01:24:43,377
your affordable college program,

2900
01:24:43,379 --> 01:24:44,678
which I love, incidentally.

2901
01:24:44,680 --> 01:24:45,712
- We'll send you to a school

2902
01:24:45,714 --> 01:24:46,713
or something.

2903
01:24:46,715 --> 01:24:48,882
- Fourth: Editorials.

2904
01:24:48,884 --> 01:24:50,317
Tawny's going to cry to every

2905
01:24:50,319 --> 01:24:51,385
reporter with a laptop that

2906
01:24:51,387 --> 01:24:52,586
you're a bad guy.

2907
01:24:52,588 --> 01:24:53,754
We get editorials saying that

2908
01:24:53,756 --> 01:24:54,988
the last thing anybody needs in

2909
01:24:54,990 --> 01:24:56,423
this economy is more lipstick

2910
01:24:56,425 --> 01:24:57,791
and pig stories.

2911
01:24:57,793 --> 01:24:58,725
Everybody should be focusing on

2912
01:24:58,727 --> 01:25:00,427
real issues that affect

2913
01:25:00,429 --> 01:25:01,195
real Americans.

2914
01:25:01,197 --> 01:25:02,629
- O.K., O.K., how about this:

2915
01:25:02,631 --> 01:25:03,931
We suggest-- gently, but serve

2916
01:25:03,933 --> 01:25:05,199
it on a silver platter--

2917
01:25:05,201 --> 01:25:06,600
that tawny is a complete

2918
01:25:06,602 --> 01:25:08,402
distraction from real issues and

2919
01:25:08,404 --> 01:25:09,536
let them hark back to when

2920
01:25:09,538 --> 01:25:11,138
mark twain was a reporter here

2921
01:25:11,140 --> 01:25:12,639
and that he could see through

2922
01:25:12,641 --> 01:25:13,740
all the smoke and nonsense,

2923
01:25:13,742 --> 01:25:15,008
like this smoke and nonsense.

2924
01:25:15,010 --> 01:25:15,809
- Mark twain.

2925
01:25:15,811 --> 01:25:16,844
They love mark twain.

2926
01:25:16,846 --> 01:25:18,946
I love quoting mark twain.

2927
01:25:18,948 --> 01:25:20,681
- Well, she actually uses zero

2928
01:25:20,683 --> 01:25:22,449
fossil fuels and thus has

2929
01:25:22,451 --> 01:25:23,984
zero emissions.

2930
01:25:23,986 --> 01:25:25,686
She can go at highway speeds,

2931
01:25:25,688 --> 01:25:26,687
and what's more, she was built

2932
01:25:26,689 --> 01:25:28,155
entirely by the class you

2933
01:25:28,157 --> 01:25:28,956
see here.

2934
01:25:32,294 --> 01:25:33,160
- Thank you all for coming.

2935
01:25:33,162 --> 01:25:34,895
This is tawny Shearson.

2936
01:25:34,897 --> 01:25:37,064
- She's going to tell you quite

2937
01:25:37,066 --> 01:25:40,000
a story about a woman wronged by

2938
01:25:40,002 --> 01:25:42,236
a United States senator.

2939
01:25:42,238 --> 01:25:43,837
- Senator, last month we went

2940
01:25:43,839 --> 01:25:44,771
to the California solar

2941
01:25:44,773 --> 01:25:46,106
challenge. - Mm-hmm.

2942
01:25:46,108 --> 01:25:46,974
- And of the five finalists,

2943
01:25:46,976 --> 01:25:48,275
we were the only public school

2944
01:25:48,277 --> 01:25:50,244
there, but we won.

2945
01:25:50,246 --> 01:25:51,378
And what we're showing here is

2946
01:25:51,380 --> 01:25:52,546
that what it takes to achieve in

2947
01:25:52,548 --> 01:25:54,448
science isn't all about money.

2948
01:25:54,450 --> 01:25:55,349
It's about inventiveness and

2949
01:25:55,351 --> 01:25:57,317
creativity and brain power.

2950
01:25:57,319 --> 01:25:58,485
All of which this class has

2951
01:25:58,487 --> 01:25:59,586
in abundance.

2952
01:25:59,588 --> 01:26:00,354
- Well, this is amazing.

2953
01:26:00,356 --> 01:26:01,788
This is truly amazing.

2954
01:26:01,790 --> 01:26:03,023
And I think I speak for myself,

2955
01:26:03,025 --> 01:26:04,024
but I also think I speak

2956
01:26:04,026 --> 01:26:05,025
for every senator when I say

2957
01:26:05,027 --> 01:26:06,326
that we can learn a lot from

2958
01:26:06,328 --> 01:26:07,361
Mr. Quinn's class.

2959
01:26:07,363 --> 01:26:08,595
It's truly amazing!

2960
01:26:08,597 --> 01:26:09,296
Give yourselves a round

2961
01:26:09,298 --> 01:26:10,797
of applause.

2962
01:26:10,799 --> 01:26:11,798
- Thank you so much for coming.

2963
01:26:16,172 --> 01:26:17,237
- Senator green, senator green.

2964
01:26:17,239 --> 01:26:18,272
Are you aware of the press

2965
01:26:18,274 --> 01:26:19,206
conference tawny Shearson

2966
01:26:19,208 --> 01:26:20,240
just gave?

2967
01:26:20,242 --> 01:26:20,941
She's claiming you had

2968
01:26:20,943 --> 01:26:25,979
an affair!

2969
01:26:25,981 --> 01:26:26,813
- I was just thinking about

2970
01:26:26,815 --> 01:26:27,848
something that mark twain once

2971
01:26:27,850 --> 01:26:29,349
said which is, "when in doubt,

2972
01:26:29,351 --> 01:26:30,751
tell the truth."

2973
01:26:30,753 --> 01:26:33,720
Well, here's the truth:

2974
01:26:33,722 --> 01:26:35,856
I have a bad back.

2975
01:26:35,858 --> 01:26:37,724
I injured it in the service

2976
01:26:37,726 --> 01:26:40,527
in Afghanistan.

2977
01:26:40,529 --> 01:26:41,762
And I receive physical therapy

2978
01:26:41,764 --> 01:26:42,629
for that injury,

2979
01:26:42,631 --> 01:26:45,999
including massages.

2980
01:26:46,001 --> 01:26:46,833
And during one of those

2981
01:26:46,835 --> 01:26:50,571
massages, I crossed the line.

2982
01:26:50,573 --> 01:26:52,005
And, uh, here's some more truth:

2983
01:26:52,007 --> 01:26:53,273
There is, there's no one to

2984
01:26:53,275 --> 01:26:55,375
blame for this but me.

2985
01:26:55,377 --> 01:26:56,376
There is no excuse for what

2986
01:26:56,378 --> 01:26:57,044
I did.

2987
01:26:57,046 --> 01:26:59,479
It was, it was wrong to do to my

2988
01:26:59,481 --> 01:27:01,748
family, it was wrong to do to

2989
01:27:01,750 --> 01:27:02,749
the people that I set an

2990
01:27:02,751 --> 01:27:03,483
example for.

2991
01:27:03,485 --> 01:27:06,320
It was just plain wrong, period.

2992
01:27:06,322 --> 01:27:07,654
Now, I could stand up here and I

2993
01:27:07,656 --> 01:27:09,223
could spin the facts and I could

2994
01:27:09,225 --> 01:27:10,924
maybe fool some of you, but I

2995
01:27:10,926 --> 01:27:12,359
believe that the people of

2996
01:27:12,361 --> 01:27:13,760
California deserve better.

2997
01:27:13,762 --> 01:27:16,063
I think that we are all tired of

2998
01:27:16,065 --> 01:27:18,031
the spin.

2999
01:27:18,033 --> 01:27:19,433
So, I am just here to offer my

3000
01:27:19,435 --> 01:27:22,436
sincere apology.

3001
01:27:22,438 --> 01:27:23,837
And it is my hope that the

3002
01:27:23,839 --> 01:27:25,572
citizens of California will

3003
01:27:25,574 --> 01:27:27,841
forgive me for this mistake and

3004
01:27:27,843 --> 01:27:29,243
will choose to reelect me.

3005
01:27:29,245 --> 01:27:31,245
I promise I will be your

3006
01:27:31,247 --> 01:27:33,747
senator, and I will work

3007
01:27:33,749 --> 01:27:36,350
tirelessly for the things that

3008
01:27:36,352 --> 01:27:39,720
matter most to you, like classes

3009
01:27:39,722 --> 01:27:41,722
taught by Matt Quinn here,

3010
01:27:41,724 --> 01:27:43,890
where our children are truly

3011
01:27:43,892 --> 01:27:45,425
inventing the future.

3012
01:27:45,427 --> 01:27:49,096
And to that end, I am proposing

3013
01:27:49,098 --> 01:27:51,598
an oil company windfall profit

3014
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:54,468
tax with the revenue providing

3015
01:27:54,470 --> 01:27:56,203
the funds for every student in

3016
01:27:56,205 --> 01:27:57,571
America with a b-plus average

3017
01:27:57,573 --> 01:27:59,573
and above to go to college!

3018
01:28:06,482 --> 01:28:07,748
I'm prepared to do everything

3019
01:28:07,750 --> 01:28:11,084
for you, as a not-perfect, but a

3020
01:28:11,086 --> 01:28:13,987
truly dedicated man, who will

3021
01:28:13,989 --> 01:28:17,024
always fight for you.

3022
01:28:31,406 --> 01:28:32,339
- ...mission in Afghanistan

3023
01:28:32,341 --> 01:28:33,140
when my helicopter was

3024
01:28:33,142 --> 01:28:34,775
shot down.

3025
01:28:34,777 --> 01:28:36,043
Both of my legs and four ribs

3026
01:28:36,045 --> 01:28:37,711
were broken.

3027
01:28:37,713 --> 01:28:40,047
The enemy came to finish us off,

3028
01:28:40,049 --> 01:28:41,415
but the young officer that I was

3029
01:28:41,417 --> 01:28:43,050
transporting single-handedly

3030
01:28:43,052 --> 01:28:44,351
fought off an entire squad of

3031
01:28:44,353 --> 01:28:45,819
Taliban until reinforcements

3032
01:28:45,821 --> 01:28:46,753
could arrive.

3033
01:28:53,062 --> 01:28:55,062
- Up, up, up!

3034
01:28:55,064 --> 01:28:55,996
Senator, you have jumped

3035
01:28:55,998 --> 01:28:57,631
five points!

3036
01:28:57,633 --> 01:28:59,099
It is off the charts!

3037
01:28:59,101 --> 01:28:59,966
- Whoo!

3038
01:28:59,968 --> 01:29:01,435
- On the other hand, tawny is

3039
01:29:01,437 --> 01:29:02,836
going to kick ass if she ever

3040
01:29:02,838 --> 01:29:03,870
decides to open a chain of

3041
01:29:03,872 --> 01:29:05,038
massage parlors.

3042
01:29:05,040 --> 01:29:05,939
- Oh, sweet.

3043
01:29:05,941 --> 01:29:07,007
Tell him to check his email.

3044
01:29:07,009 --> 01:29:07,841
Jimmy just sent us all

3045
01:29:07,843 --> 01:29:08,542
a present.

3046
01:29:08,544 --> 01:29:09,376
- Check your email, we got

3047
01:29:09,378 --> 01:29:10,711
something coming your way.

3048
01:29:10,713 --> 01:29:11,545
- And then tawny went

3049
01:29:11,547 --> 01:29:12,713
up to the Rollerblade guy and

3050
01:29:12,715 --> 01:29:14,548
took two knee pads and she said,

3051
01:29:14,550 --> 01:29:16,583
"these guys-- a ticket to

3052
01:29:16,585 --> 01:29:20,020
Washington and this body

3053
01:29:20,022 --> 01:29:21,822
and I'm golden."

3054
01:29:21,824 --> 01:29:24,291
- How did that make you feel?

3055
01:29:24,293 --> 01:29:25,292
- Um...

3056
01:29:25,294 --> 01:29:28,628
<i-> Now that is room service.

3057
01:29:28,630 --> 01:29:30,030
- Oh, my God.

3058
01:29:30,032 --> 01:29:31,998
Penelope's video just got five

3059
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:33,266
million views on YouTube.

3060
01:29:33,268 --> 01:29:34,134
- You see, when you're doing

3061
01:29:34,136 --> 01:29:35,402
God's work and you're at the

3062
01:29:35,404 --> 01:29:36,903
right place at the right time,

3063
01:29:36,905 --> 01:29:38,138
good things happen.

3064
01:29:38,140 --> 01:29:38,805
- Best hundred bucks

3065
01:29:38,807 --> 01:29:39,673
you ever spent.

3066
01:29:39,675 --> 01:29:40,841
- What do you mean?

3067
01:29:40,843 --> 01:29:41,575
- What do you mean,

3068
01:29:41,577 --> 01:29:43,744
what do I mean?

3069
01:29:43,746 --> 01:29:45,379
- What are you talking about?

3070
01:29:45,381 --> 01:29:46,747
Does somebody want to tell me

3071
01:29:46,749 --> 01:29:48,181
what's going on?

3072
01:29:48,183 --> 01:29:48,949
- It's O.K.

3073
01:29:48,951 --> 01:29:50,250
- Oh, my God.

3074
01:29:50,252 --> 01:29:52,786
I just assumed that

3075
01:29:52,788 --> 01:29:54,321
she told you.

3076
01:29:54,323 --> 01:29:56,056
Your girl here had me send the

3077
01:29:56,058 --> 01:29:58,725
guy to the clinic.

3078
01:29:58,727 --> 01:30:00,026
- You did what?

3079
01:30:00,028 --> 01:30:02,662
- O.K., in her defense, I gave

3080
01:30:02,664 --> 01:30:03,830
the guy a hundred bucks, I told

3081
01:30:03,832 --> 01:30:04,998
him to scream and wave the knife

3082
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:05,699
around a little.

3083
01:30:05,701 --> 01:30:07,267
In no way... Did I

3084
01:30:07,269 --> 01:30:08,902
think that he was gonna take

3085
01:30:08,904 --> 01:30:09,770
a hostage.

3086
01:30:09,772 --> 01:30:10,604
I didn't think that was

3087
01:30:10,606 --> 01:30:12,372
- you gave a junkie a knife?

3088
01:30:12,374 --> 01:30:14,341
- Yeah, well, in retrospect.

3089
01:30:14,343 --> 01:30:15,976
- Meg Whitman spent 175

3090
01:30:15,978 --> 01:30:17,010
million-plus running for

3091
01:30:17,012 --> 01:30:18,245
governor.

3092
01:30:18,247 --> 01:30:20,213
We spent a hundred dollars and

3093
01:30:20,215 --> 01:30:21,882
took Penelope's name recognition

3094
01:30:21,884 --> 01:30:25,252
from nonexistent to omnipresent.

3095
01:30:25,254 --> 01:30:28,488
Am I fired?

3096
01:30:34,529 --> 01:30:37,330
- You are a brilliant,

3097
01:30:37,332 --> 01:30:41,134
beautiful woman.

3098
01:30:41,136 --> 01:30:44,304
- What happened to the guy?

3099
01:30:44,306 --> 01:30:46,506
- He's doing 90 days.

3100
01:30:46,508 --> 01:30:47,507
I'll give him another $500 when

3101
01:30:47,509 --> 01:30:48,275
he gets out.

3102
01:30:48,277 --> 01:30:49,643
He'll send me flowers for such a

3103
01:30:49,645 --> 01:30:51,478
nice payday.

3104
01:30:51,480 --> 01:30:53,413
O.K., I'll give him a thousand.

3105
01:31:02,824 --> 01:31:03,857
- As we've been reporting,

3106
01:31:03,859 --> 01:31:05,592
Stephen green had an easy

3107
01:31:05,594 --> 01:31:07,928
reelection tonight, but the real

3108
01:31:07,930 --> 01:31:10,730
story is right here.

3109
01:31:10,732 --> 01:31:11,998
In a gubernatorial race that's

3110
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:13,333
too tight to call between

3111
01:31:13,335 --> 01:31:14,901
upstart candidate Penelope

3112
01:31:14,903 --> 01:31:16,937
Nelson and Hollywood megastar

3113
01:31:16,939 --> 01:31:18,505
Hank Harrison.

3114
01:31:18,507 --> 01:31:19,773
- We have really done something

3115
01:31:19,775 --> 01:31:21,007
incredible.

3116
01:31:21,009 --> 01:31:22,909
No matter what happens tonight,

3117
01:31:22,911 --> 01:31:24,544
we have done something

3118
01:31:24,546 --> 01:31:25,779
incredible.

3119
01:31:28,750 --> 01:31:30,116
-It was a very steep

3120
01:31:30,118 --> 01:31:32,052
hill to climb indeed.

3121
01:31:32,054 --> 01:31:33,253
Ms. Nelson is going to need a

3122
01:31:33,255 --> 01:31:35,455
huge turnout in Los Angeles and

3123
01:31:35,457 --> 01:31:37,524
the bay area if she has any hope

3124
01:31:37,526 --> 01:31:38,859
of eating into Mr. Harrison's

3125
01:31:38,861 --> 01:31:40,093
margins.

3126
01:31:40,095 --> 01:31:42,462
Again, very discouraging news

3127
01:31:42,464 --> 01:31:44,164
for Ms. Nelson's campaign and

3128
01:31:44,166 --> 01:31:45,365
her supporters.

3129
01:31:45,367 --> 01:31:46,466
Hank Harrison, one of the

3130
01:31:46,468 --> 01:31:47,667
country's most popular

3131
01:31:47,669 --> 01:31:49,035
television and movie stars,

3132
01:31:49,037 --> 01:31:50,470
has been in the public eye for

3133
01:31:50,472 --> 01:31:51,938
over three decades.

3134
01:31:51,940 --> 01:31:54,074
And with 76% of precincts

3135
01:31:54,076 --> 01:31:55,775
reporting, if he can maintain

3136
01:31:55,777 --> 01:31:57,978
that lead, he'll be our next

3137
01:31:57,980 --> 01:31:59,379
governor.

3138
01:31:59,381 --> 01:32:00,413
We have just learned that Santa

3139
01:32:00,415 --> 01:32:01,815
Barbara, San joaquin and

3140
01:32:01,817 --> 01:32:03,116
Sacramento counties,

3141
01:32:03,118 --> 01:32:04,985
all bellwether counties,

3142
01:32:04,987 --> 01:32:07,454
have reported and all three have

3143
01:32:07,456 --> 01:32:12,092
gone narrowly for Hank Harrison.

3144
01:32:12,094 --> 01:32:14,594
This is a devastating blow to

3145
01:32:14,596 --> 01:32:16,563
Ms. Nelson's campaign.

3146
01:32:16,565 --> 01:32:17,864
Sacramento must also be

3147
01:32:17,866 --> 01:32:19,032
particularly disappointing

3148
01:32:19,034 --> 01:32:19,833
for her, as traditionally...

3149
01:32:19,835 --> 01:32:20,967
- You O.K.?

3150
01:32:20,969 --> 01:32:21,801
- Yeah, I'm O.K.

3151
01:32:21,803 --> 01:32:22,469
- ...As goes

3152
01:32:22,471 --> 01:32:23,803
Sacramento county, so goes

3153
01:32:23,805 --> 01:32:25,438
California.

3154
01:32:25,440 --> 01:32:26,439
And we're still waiting for

3155
01:32:26,441 --> 01:32:28,074
results from Los Angeles county

3156
01:32:28,076 --> 01:32:30,577
and the bay area to come--

3157
01:32:30,579 --> 01:32:32,512
O.K.

3158
01:32:32,514 --> 01:32:34,114
We just got word, Los Angeles

3159
01:32:34,116 --> 01:32:36,149
county has reported and Penelope

3160
01:32:36,151 --> 01:32:38,718
Nelson is over the top.

3161
01:32:38,720 --> 01:32:39,719
- Hey!

3162
01:32:39,721 --> 01:32:40,453
Hey!

3163
01:32:40,455 --> 01:32:42,322
- My God!

3164
01:32:52,167 --> 01:32:54,167
- What an incredible victory

3165
01:32:54,169 --> 01:32:55,602
for Penelope Nelson.

3166
01:32:56,838 --> 01:32:58,238
Penelope Nelson, who ran her

3167
01:32:58,240 --> 01:33:00,907
campaign on passion and promise,

3168
01:33:00,909 --> 01:33:02,576
but so very little money,

3169
01:33:02,578 --> 01:33:03,476
will be the next governor...

3170
01:33:03,478 --> 01:33:05,679
- Un-fucking-believable.

3171
01:33:05,681 --> 01:33:07,414
Un-fucking-believable!

3172
01:33:15,290 --> 01:33:15,989
- Thank you!

3173
01:33:15,991 --> 01:33:17,624
Thank you!

3174
01:33:17,626 --> 01:33:19,492
- Thank you, California!

3175
01:33:28,003 --> 01:33:29,035
- And at the governor's mansion

3176
01:33:29,037 --> 01:33:31,571
