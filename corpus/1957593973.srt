00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,918
(dramatic music)

3
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,720
(groaning)

4
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,400
- Bobby!

5
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,000
Bobby, are you out here?

6
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,120
- Go away, go away, go away,

7
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,000
go away, go away,
go away, go away.

8
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:33,960
- [Man] Bobby, what...

9
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,120
What are you doing, man?

10
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,240
- I'm here.

11
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,200
I'm out here.

12
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,720
- Come inside.

13
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,480
- Shit.

14
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,680
- Fire's out.

15
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,760
- Oh.

16
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,640
Thanks.

17
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,120
- [Man] You feeling
all right, bud?

18
00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:59,600
(snapping)
- Huh?

19
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,000
Oh.

20
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,480
Yeah, I'm okay.

21
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,840
- What are you doing
out on the lake?

22
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,360
- Thinking.

23
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,160
It's quiet out there.

24
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,480
- (chuckles) It's quiet in here.

25
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,480
How much have you
had to drink tonight?

26
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:23,920
- A little bit.

27
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,240
Not much.

28
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,240
- Well.

29
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,480
You don't seem like yourself.

30
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,400
- Well, Andrew, I'm not myself.

31
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,360
- Anything you uh...

32
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,600
Need?

33
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,880
You know, we worry about you

34
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,040
all the way out
here with no car.

35
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,080
- I don't want a car.

36
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,720
And I don't need anything.

37
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,760
- Is there anything
you wanna talk about?

38
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,360
- Nope.

39
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,280
- All right, well.

40
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,520
Food's in the cupboard.

41
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,280
- Thanks.

42
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,320
- We all loved her, you know.

43
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,880
We're all going through this.

44
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:28,920
I hate to see you
like this, man.

45
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,880
Check in on you tomorrow.

46
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,480
(door shutting)

47
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,760
- Don't bother.

48
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,800
(dramatic music)

49
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,680

(bird screeching)

54
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,280
Bridgette?

55
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:42,920
Bridgette?

56
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:48,000
(glass breaking)
Ah!

57
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:48,760
Bridgette!

58
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,400
(groaning)

59
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,760
(phone vibrating)

60
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:14,920
Oh, stop calling me.

61
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,400
(wincing)

62
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,000
Bridgette?

63
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,880
(groaning)

64
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,280
- Do you really need that?

65
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,880
- Bridgette?

66
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,320
- Yes, my love?

67
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,280
- Bridgette!

68
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,240
(ragged breathing)

69
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,560
(pills rattling)

70
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,720
(discordant music)

71
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:39,280
(woman screaming)

72
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,520
(screeching)

73
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:45,920
Bridgette?

74
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:19,360
Ah!

75
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:23,600
Oh!

76
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,200
One of them's still bleeding.

77
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,440
Goddamn, I don't have
time for this right now.

78
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,600
(panting)

79
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:12,400
Ah!

80
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,120
(groaning)

81
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,960
(doorbell chiming)

82
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,520
(knocking)

83
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:54,080
- Yes?

84
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,280
Can I help you?

85
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,200
- Hi, yeah I'm
sorry to bother you.

86
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,400
I saw you from across the lake.

87
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,200
My family owns the
cottage across.

88
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,400
I hurt my foot and um...

89
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,440
- Oh, please,

90
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,800
Oh, come in, come in.

91
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,240
I didn't know anybody
else was on the lake.

92
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,600
- Thank you.

93
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,720
Yeah, we're not usually up here.

94
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,400
I just uh...

95
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,840
I'm here for a couple weeks
staying at my in-laws cottage,

96
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:16,960
the Burns.

97
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,320
- Oh, the Burns family.

98
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,120
- Yeah, they're kinda
notorious around here.

99
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:20,920
- Come in, come in.

100
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:21,960
- Thank you.

101
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,160
Thank you.

102
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,280
Oh, sorry to bother
you, I just...

103
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:26,600
I saw you from across
the lake and uh,

104
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,800
I ran out of first
aid supplies, so.

105
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,240
- How did this happen?

106
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:34,200
- I cut my foot on some
broken glass walking,

107
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,200
and it hasn't really
stopped bleeding.

108
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,560
- Oh.

109
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,440
Well, let me get my kit
and I'll take a look at it.

110
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,200
- Oh, thank you.

111
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,360
Huh.

112
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,680
This you?

113
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:49,120
- [Woman] Yes, I caught
that fish all on my own.

114
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,200
- Ah.

115
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,800
Here in this lake?
- Here in this lake.

116
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,000
- I didn't know we
had fish that big.

117
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,200
- Well, I think my husband
used to stock it with fish

118
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,200
just so that we
could catch them,

119
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,280
but I could never prove it.

120
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,800
- Sounds like a character.

121
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,680
- That he was, that he was.

122
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,160
Now, let me take a look at this.

123
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:07,920
- All right.

124
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,440
(wincing)

125
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,760
Sorry.

126
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,280
I don't want to bleed
on your floor here.

127
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,800
- Oh God, I'll get a towel.

128
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,080
- Okay.

129
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:22,560
- Thank you.
- Okay.

130
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,960
- Let me take a look.

131
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:26,120
(wincing)

132
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:27,960
- Ah!
- Ah.

133
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:36,640
- I didn't do such
a swell job there.

134
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,400
Here.

135
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:40,680
- Can I help?

136
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:45,640
- No, I can get it.

137
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:47,080
- Okay, let me take a look.

138
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:55,120
(Bobby sniffs)

139
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,600
Now, I'm not kidding you.

140
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:00,120
This is gonna hurt.

141
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:02,200
- Well, I already hurt, so.

142
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,000
- Are you ready?

143
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:03,760
- Yeah, have at it.

144
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,800
- Hold on, hold on.

145
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,840
(Bobby wincing)

146
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:11,600
There!

147
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,880
- Ah, God, that was in my foot?

148
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,880
- [Woman] It's getting
pretty dark out,

149
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:19,880
I should drive you home.

150
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,240
- Oh, no, no, no.

151
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,200
No cars.

152
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,080
I can make my way.

153
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,360
I like being on the lake.

154
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,640
It's calm, peaceful.

155
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:28,920
- It's none of my business,

156
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:31,280
but were you out
there last night?

157
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,360
- Yeah, did I bother you?

158
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,280
- No.

159
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,240
- Sorry, if...

160
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:40,280
- Well, who was doing
all that hollering?

161
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,680
- Oh, that was my
brother-in-law, Andrew.

162
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:47,040
- Little Andrew Burns.

163
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,320
- Yeah.

164
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,080
Well, he's not so
little anymore.

165
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:52,200
- Well, they all
seemed little to me.

166
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,840
They all grew up
with my children.

167
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,920
All those wonderful
summers on this lake.

168
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:01,880
- Hmm.

169
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:04,920
- Bobby, I...

170
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,400
I know we never met until now,

171
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,720
but I knew who you were.

172
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,800
I read about the auto
accident in the papers.

173
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:21,920
And I just...

174
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,080
I just wanna say.

175
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:31,520
I'm so sorry.

176
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,720
Bridgette was a darling girl.

177
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:42,440
- Yeah.

178
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,560
Yeah, she was.

179
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:00,560
(boat bumping the dock)

180
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:26,960
- Whew, for a minute
I didn't think

181
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,200
you were coming back for me.

182
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:33,920
Down here, right here.

183
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:36,200
That's right, Bobby,
this heavenly rum.

184
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:39,000
- Oh God, what am I taking?

185
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,560
- Some pretty darn good
stuff, I'd say. (chuckles)

186
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,960
- This isn't happening.

187
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:48,240
- Making sure your nosy
brother-in-law isn't there,

188
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,240
that is smart.

189
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:51,280
What a downer he is, really.

190
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,360
- Oh, you know Andrew.

191
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,360
Who, what am I talking to?

192
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:00,240
- My name's Thelonious.

193
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,360
Friends call me Theo.

194
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,680
- We are not friends.

195
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:05,560
- Not yet, but I can
be pretty persuasive.

196
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,160
- Based on the
nascent stage of this

197
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,960
budding friendship, I
ask that you not talk.

198
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,920
- Oh, I can keep
quiet if you like.

199
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:14,080
- I would like that
very much, Thelonious.

200
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,600
Maybe there's hope for us yet.

201
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,320
- [Theo] No problem.

202
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,280
- Oh.

203
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:39,600
Okay, good.

204
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,240
I'm going to sleep.

205
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,560
I gotta stop talking to myself.

206
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,320
- Goodnight!

207
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:51,280
- Oh, crap, you
are talking to me.

208
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:55,080
- Only when my belly is full
of this delicious beverage.

209
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:55,960
When it goes, I go.

210
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:56,880
It's my life source.

211
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,680
- Hmm, mine too.

212
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,760
- What is said while drunk
is thought of beforehand.

213
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:01,680
- What?

214
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,280
- It's a Flemish proverb.

215
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,640
It means when you're drunk,
you're gonna say things that--

216
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,560
- Yeah, I can figure
out what it means.

217
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,640
Hmm.

218
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,000
- [Theo] Say something there?

219
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,280
- Why do these pills look
different than those?

220
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:24,440
- Maybe 'cause your pills
are not those pills.

221
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,200
Ever heard of Occam's Razor?

222
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:30,240
Oh, William of
Occam, what a sage.

223
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,120
Well, he was a friar,
much like myself,

224
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:35,720
and he theorized among
competing hypotheses,

225
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,280
the one with the
fewest assumptions

226
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,080
should be selected,

227
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,440
or more simply put,

228
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,720
the simplest answer tends
to be the correct one.

229
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,520
No, no!

230
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:43,800
Not a band-aid!

231
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:46,160
How are you gonna
cover your cutting?

232
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,240
- What did you say?

233
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,200
- You heard me.

234
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,200
Your cuts.

235
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:57,080
(Bobby exhales)

236
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,240
- Wow.

237
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:23,080
I actually did that.

238
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:39,240
- Hey, let me help
you with that.

239
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,520
Where were you yesterday?

240
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,600
- I went for a walk.

241
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,200
- You hurt yourself?

242
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,320
- I twisted my ankle.

243
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,480
- What's this stuff
in the trashcan?

244
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:15,520
- I cut myself shaving.

245
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,560
- Mm-hmm.

246
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,640
Look, man, is there
anything that you--

247
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,240
- No.

248
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,320
No, I don't wanna
talk about anything.

249
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,040
- Wasn't gonna ask you that.

250
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:28,400
I was just gonna ask
if there's, you know,

251
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,520
anything else you need.

252
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,240
- Sorry, I'm just sick
of everyone asking

253
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,520
if I wanna talk about things.

254
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,200
No, I don't need anything else.

255
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,040
Oh.

256
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:44,880
Wait um...

257
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:46,640
Rum.

258
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,200
I could use another
bottle of Old Monk.

259
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,000
- (chuckles) I don't
know if that's so wise.

260
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,800
- You asked me if
there's anything I need

261
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,320
and then I tell you rum and
you don't wanna get it for me.

262
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,480
- I just think, you know.

263
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,680
You've been hitting that
stuff pretty hard lately, man.

264
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:01,440
- And?

265
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,160
- I don't think
you need anymore.

266
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:06,400
- No, you know what I need?

267
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,880
Need being the operative
word in that sentence.

268
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,680
I need my wife back!

269
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:14,240
Can you help me out with that?

270
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,840
- No.
- No, I didn't think so.

271
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,200
So if you can't help
me out with that,

272
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,920
then I would like
some more rum, please.

273
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,200
And some band-aids.

274
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:25,200
- Bobby--
- Just leave, please.

275
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:28,400
- I'm sorry.

276
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,080
Look, I'll...

277
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:35,040
I'll stop by a little later
or tomorrow or something.

278
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:39,480
My mom might come by with little
Gregory if you're up to it.

279
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:40,800
- [Bobby] No.

280
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,000
I can't take it from her.

281
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,400
- Look, man, she doesn't
mean to act like...

282
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,960
That's just her way, you know.

283
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,240
I'm sorry.

284
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,480
Okay, then.

285
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,520
I'm gonna head out.

286
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:08,280
(door shutting)

287
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:11,520
(light acoustic music)

288
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:35,880
(clock ticking)

289
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:40,000
- It's not what you think.

290
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,160
I was, uh, chasing my flask.

291
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:44,880
It went in the
water and I was uh--

292
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,240
- You don't have to
explain anything to me.

293
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:52,800
- It was a bachelor party gift,

294
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,760
I didn't really
want to let it sink.

295
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:55,920
- Hmm.

296
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,360
How would you like some soup?

297
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,240
- Please.

298
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,960
- Clam chowder?

299
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:02,840
- Sounds delicious.

300
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:04,720
- Good.

301
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,360
Made it this morning.

302
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:07,080
- Thank you.

303
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,320
I lied.

304
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:22,320
I threw it in, the flask.

305
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,280
I threw it in and

306
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,640
I regretted immediately doing it

307
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:27,720
and stood up to get it
and I lost my balance

308
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:28,840
and I guess I should...

309
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,000
- You shouldn't
have been drinking

310
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,760
at nine o'clock in the morning.

311
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:33,520
- Yeah.

312
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:38,640
I just...

313
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:42,640
I hate waking up
without her there.

314
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,240
- I know.

315
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:50,280
When my husband died,
the man in the picture

316
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,240
with the trout.

317
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:55,040
(Bobby laughs)

318
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,680
I couldn't stand being alone.

319
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:58,600
I couldn't stand
not being with him.

320
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:02,880
So I spent a lot of time in bed.

321
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:07,320
- How long ago did he die?

322
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:10,120
- Oh, about 20 years.

323
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,120
- When did that feeling go away?

324
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,120
- It doesn't go away.

325
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:18,520
It gets better over time,

326
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:22,320
but it doesn't really go away.

327
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:25,320
And then something
will remind you,

328
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:27,880
you'll see someone
who looks at you

329
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,560
the way she looked at you

330
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:32,160
or you'll hear a phrase
the way she used to say it.

331
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:38,000
You know, I used to think that
I would see him everywhere

332
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,280
a year after he
died and one day,

333
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:46,320
I really heard somebody
call, "Maggie!"

334
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,200
Really.

335
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:55,240
I think it was his way of
helping me manage things.

336
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,400
- [Bobby] How did he die?

337
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:07,480
- A heart attack.

338
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:09,520
He was 45.

339
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:11,720
We had kids.

340
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:12,720
It was tough.

341
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,960
So what do you do
when you're not here?

342
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:21,840
- I'm in advertising.

343
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,200
- Oh, how exciting.

344
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,920
Are you in one of those big
firms on Madison Avenue?

345
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:26,720
- Yeah.

346
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,520
One of those.

347
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,280
- Ah.
- Mm.

348
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,440
I'm a creative director.

349
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,440
- Wow.

350
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:34,280
And you're here because...

351
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:36,360
- Took some personal
time for a few weeks.

352
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:39,840
My wife.

353
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:40,600
- The accident.

354
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:43,400
- We have a son.

355
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:45,840
- [Maggie] A son?

356
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:48,360
- Mm, he's with my
mother-in-law right now.

357
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:49,320
- Oh, Barbara?

358
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,200
Oh.

359
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,280
She is a force of nature.

360
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:55,360
- Mm-hmm.

361
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,440
Yeah, she is.

362
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:59,200
(Maggie laughs)

363
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:02,280
I don't think she thinks
I can raise him on my own.

364
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:04,760
- Well, it'll be tough, but.

365
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,320
You're not going to be alone.

366
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,200
- [Man's Voice] Oh,
your hands are warm!

367
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:44,480
- Hello?

368
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,080
- Psst, hey.

369
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,720
Right over here, down here.

370
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,840
- Oh no, not another one.

371
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,320
- You know, for
most of us monks,

372
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:55,960
the whole vow of silence
thing really sucks.

373
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:56,760
So when--
- Shut up.

374
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:58,000
- You're, there's--

375
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,840
- I'm drinking you, not
conversing with you.

376
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:02,560
- Rude is the word
that I'm thinking of.

377
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:03,880
- Well, then stop talking.

378
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,440
Andrew?

379
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:31,240
Is that you man?

380
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,200
Don't scare me.

381
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:37,560
Oh, it's you.

382
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,960
Look, buddy, this
is private property.

383
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,400
- I heard you on the lake.

384
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,720
Came to see if you'd
found any of my regiment.

385
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:48,080
- Dude, it's late.

386
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,360
You gotta give up the act.

387
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,480
Is this a week long thing?

388
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,800
- So you haven't seen any of--

389
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,240
- Nope, none.

390
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,560
Look, Fahnestock State
Park goes on for miles

391
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:01,280
of that direction, they're
probably all lost in there.

392
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:02,640
You guys mostly from the city?

393
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,400
- Fahnestock State Park?

394
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,280
- Look, General.

395
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,320
No disrespect, but if you
wanna find your friends,

396
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:15,560
I suggest you drop the act.

397
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:16,440
I mean, seriously.

398
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:20,040
I wish I had a map or
some way you could call.

399
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,280
It's gonna be cold in there.

400
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,760
Okay, random, thought
we were talking,

401
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,360
guess not.

402
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:28,680
Me thinketh this is stupid!

403
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:30,880
You understand that?

404
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:39,800
This is private property, buddy!

405
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,160
- [Bottle] That was weird.

406
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,840
- No comments outta you.

407
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:44,200
- [Bottle] 'Kay.

408
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:49,280
What is happening here, Bobby?

409
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,360
Bobby?

410
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,320
Bobby?

411
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:56,040
So, Bobby, you all right?

412
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,280
What did you do to Thelonious?

413
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,960
- Oh, no, no, no.

414
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:11,000
Don't you start.

415
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,240
- Oh, I'll start
in whenever I...

416
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,440
Do you know why, 'cause
this isn't right.

417
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,200
We are only here
to help you, Bobby.

418
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,240
May I call you Bobby?

419
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,360
Yeah, and guess what, pal?

420
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:19,880
We're all you've got.

421
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:20,920
- No.

422
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,560
No, no, this isn't happening.

423
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:23,360
- Oh yeah.

424
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,960
Yeah, it's happening.

425
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,720
'Cause you have a long way
to go before you hit bottom,

426
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,320
my friend, and just remember,

427
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:30,560
smooth seas make poor sailors.

428
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:31,720
- Oh, great!

429
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:32,720
More proverbs.

430
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:33,520
- I'm full of 'em.

431
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:35,120
Got 'em coming all day.

432
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,920
You can't see the fox in
the forest for the trees.

433
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:38,520
- That's not even a proverb.

434
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,600
(groaning)

435
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,920
(sighs)

436
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:30,160
Oh, shoot!

437
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:55,440
Ah!

438
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:20,920
(knocking on door)

439
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:23,480
Shit!
(glass breaking)

440
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:26,800
Barbara, wow.

441
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:30,280
Great to see you.

442
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:33,080
Andrew didn't really mention
that you were coming by.

443
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:33,840
- Really?

444
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,320
I told him to.

445
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:37,240
And I left a few messages.

446
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:39,040
So how are you doing?

447
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:41,280
I brought over your
medication from the drugstore

448
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,360
and they gave you some extra

449
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:43,920
so you don't have
to go into town.

450
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:45,880
You look well.

451
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:50,440
- No, I don't, Barbara.

452
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:52,680
We shouldn't lie to each other.

453
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,520
- No, I guess we shouldn't.

454
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:58,640
Actually, you look terrible
and you stink of alcohol.

455
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,360
- Well, you should know.

456
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,760
- What?

457
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,320
- I didn't mean it like
that, I just meant that--

458
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,560
- If we're going
for honesty here,

459
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,360
I think you better
clarify what you mean.

460
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:08,480
- It was dumb of me
to say, but all right.

461
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:11,640
Your family isn't exactly
a bunch of teetotalers.

462
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:14,280
(Barbara laughs)

463
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,840
- Well, I didn't come here
to argue with you, Bobby,

464
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:19,960
I just brought Gregory
over here to see you.

465
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,520
And a bottle of
your favorite rum.

466
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:23,280
- Oh.

467
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:25,760
Thanks, I uh...

468
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:29,840
- He is in the car
asleep, though.

469
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:31,320
- Probably should
let him sleep, then.

470
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,640
- Yes, I am.

471
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,400
- Yeah and I don't want
him to see me right now.

472
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,720
I'm looking kinda rough.

473
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,840
- Andrew's been over to
see you a couple of times?

474
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,240
- Yeah, he's...

475
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:42,200
He comes by.

476
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:44,200
Brings me things.

477
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,360
Things I need.

478
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:48,680
- That's good.

479
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:49,840
Anything else you need?

480
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:53,600
- No.

481
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:57,200
I'm pretty good
- Maybe I should go.

482
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,200
- Oh, you just got here.

483
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:59,560
Look, I know this is awkward.

484
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,120
It's awkward for me, too.

485
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:05,840
Do you want some coffee?

486
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,400
- Sure, that would be nice.

487
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,080
- Let me just wash
out a mug for you,

488
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:13,160
it'll just take a second.

489
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,800
- Oh, I have the match
of that one at the house,

490
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:19,880
I should have brought it.

491
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,400
- Oh, yeah, it's my favorite.

492
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:24,800
Makes me feel like
I'm really camping,

493
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,240
like my dad and I used
to do when I was little.

494
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:28,280
- How is your father?

495
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:31,560
- He's fine.

496
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:32,320
I think.

497
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,520
I haven't really talked
to him in a while.

498
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:39,680
I guess I haven't really
talked to anybody in a while.

499
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:42,920
- That's understandable.

500
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,160
Listen, while you're doing that,

501
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:49,000
I'll just go get the baby.

502
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:49,920
- Huh?

503
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,800
Oh, no, no, no, it's uh...

504
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,040
No, I'll do that.

505
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,520
Let me just get this going here.

506
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,680
Oh, right, I was gonna
go check on Gregory.

507
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:25,600
(dramatic music)

508
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:41,080
- He looks exactly like you.

509
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,560
He's so precious.

510
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,160
Like a little baby bird.

511
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:52,840
- You're here.

512
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:01,920
Your mother's inside.

513
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:07,360
- I know, I see her judging
you from the window.

514
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:13,200
She's watching you to see
how she'll act with him,

515
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,120
so you can't talk to me

516
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,840
or look at me or
look towards me.

517
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:21,280
Go on.

518
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:24,640
Pick him up.

519
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,600
- I can't do it, Bridge.

520
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:52,040
I can't do this without you.

521
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:55,840
I'm scared.

522
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,480
I'm really, really scared.

523
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:03,840
Bridgette.

524
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:11,080
Bridgette?

525
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:16,920
You can't keep doing this to me.

526
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:18,120
You're either here
or you're not,

527
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:19,560
you can't have it both ways.

528
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,200
He's still asleep.

529
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:48,800
I didn't want to wake him.

530
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:51,680
- Oh, well, I can't just
leave him out there.

531
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:53,360
I'll just go get the car seat

532
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:54,640
and he can sleep in that.

533
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:56,240
- No, no.

534
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:57,600
I don't think
that's a good idea.

535
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,280
- Well, that's all right.

536
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:00,640
We'll just be leaving, then.

537
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:02,000
- No, no, no, no, here.

538
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,320
Let me just--

539
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:05,160
- Look, I'll take Gregory
back to the house.

540
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:11,200
- Yeah.

541
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,920
Maybe in a day or two.

542
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:17,200
I'm sorry, Barbara, I'm not,

543
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,560
I'm not really ready
for all this right now.

544
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:21,720
I'm not really
myself these days.

545
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:22,480
I don't...

546
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:27,000
I don't know what to tell you.

547
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:30,720
- Are you taking all
of your medication?

548
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:32,360
- Yeah, I don't
think it's helping.

549
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:34,440
I'm seeing...

550
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,240
I'm not seeing clearly.

551
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:41,920
- Well, it's been tough
on all of us, Bobby.

552
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:44,360
I lost my daughter.

553
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:47,080
- I know.

554
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:49,760
I wish it was me driving.

555
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:52,640
- I think.

556
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:55,200
I think it's best if we leave.

557
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:58,440
- Yeah, I think that's best.

558
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:00,120
We don't wanna go
down that road again.

559
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:05,720
- (chuckles) No.

560
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:08,720
Why would we want
to relive that?

561
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:14,360
(door shutting)

562
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:32,720
(car starting)

563
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:40,480
(pills rattling)

564
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:49,400
- Wow.

565
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:52,160
That's...

566
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:55,360
Pretty sad there, honey.

567
00:42:57,600 --> 00:43:00,240
You couldn't pick up our son
and then you hit the liquor

568
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:01,880
and the coffee like it's water.

569
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:04,160
She's never gonna let you take--

570
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:05,760
- Leave me alone!

571
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:08,560
You're not here anymore, you
have no right to criticize me!

572
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:10,200
- Oh, so you do feel something?

573
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:12,400
That's good.

574
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:22,440
- Please, stop.

575
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:25,200
Please just stop this.

576
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:28,240
(forcibly exhales)

577
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:17,480
- Morning, sunshine.

578
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:19,320
- You're here.

579
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:20,080
- Yep.

580
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:22,480
It's cold in here.

581
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:24,120
- Oh, let me get
you another blanket.

582
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:29,720
I got this.

583
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:31,200
I got this, I got this.

584
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:32,680
- A blanket's not gonna help me.

585
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:35,560
I need you to listen to me.

586
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:38,440
I need you to get
your act together.

587
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:40,920
They're not gonna let
you take care of--

588
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:42,960
- No, no, no, I got
a blanket right here.

589
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,440
No!

590
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:48,720
No.

591
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:50,120
No, I got you a
blanket, don't go.

592
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:16,600
(taking deep breaths)

593
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:49,840
(wincing)

594
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:58,720
Hey, Andrew.

595
00:45:58,720 --> 00:45:59,760
Yeah, it's me, Bobby.

596
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:04,680
Yeah, I wanted to see if maybe
you wanted to go for a walk,

597
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:06,000
up in the woods.

598
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:09,600
Yeah, like a hike.

599
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:12,880
You know, I'm just...

600
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:15,520
Just getting a little
stir crazy in here and...

601
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:20,560
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

602
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:21,320
Sure.

603
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:24,760
Uh-huh, yeah, well
another time, then.

604
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:26,680
Yep.

605
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:40,320
Bridgette?

606
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:07,560
- Hey, sunshine.

607
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:08,320
- Bridgette.

608
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:10,840
What are you doing?

609
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:11,760
You look so pale.

610
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:12,520
- I'm fine, I can't feel this.

611
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:13,520
- But you look so pale.

612
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:16,000
- Looks can be deceiving.

613
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:20,600
Bobby, I need you to promise me

614
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:22,240
you're gonna take
care of our son.

615
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:25,240
- It's not that easy, I...

616
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:26,200
I don't know.

617
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:27,120
I don't know what I'm doing.

618
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:28,240
- Baby, it doesn't matter.

619
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:31,960
Please, just promise me you're
not gonna let her do this.

620
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:33,120
(branch snapping)

621
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:33,880
- Hello?

622
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:40,640
Andrew!

623
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:42,760
What are you doing out here?

624
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:45,240
- Once I got off the
phone I started thinking,

625
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:46,480
what am I gonna do at work?

626
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:47,600
- Wait, work?

627
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:49,720
What is today?

628
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:52,560
- It's Tuesday, Bobby.

629
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:53,840
- Oh.

630
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:54,760
Sorry, I wouldn't
have called you

631
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:56,080
if I knew it was a work day.

632
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:57,280
- Yeah, so I packed
up my bag, you know,

633
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:59,920
I called my boss, "I'll
see you tomorrow."

634
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:01,440
Came out here to get
some fresh air with you.

635
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:03,320
- Oh.

636
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:05,400
Thanks.

637
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:08,480
I'm shocked.

638
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:12,080
Want some rum?

639
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:15,240
- No, no, not really.

640
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:18,120
Well, okay.

641
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:28,280
Hey, were you saying something?

642
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:30,360
I thought I heard your
voice when I was coming up.

643
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:32,840
- (scoffs) I've been
talking to myself a lot.

644
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:35,680
It's quiet at the lake house.

645
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:40,360
- Bobby.

646
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:43,440
Are you all right?

647
00:48:58,280 --> 00:48:59,840
- Sometimes I think that I am.

648
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:04,240
Then this wave hits me,

649
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:08,480
this tsunami of
uncontrollable sadness

650
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:10,280
and it just knocks me down.

651
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:14,320
- I think that's normal.

652
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:19,560
I think that's how
you're supposed to feel.

653
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:21,960
- And I can't get my feet
under me or anything.

654
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:23,960
You know?

655
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:34,200
I miss her so much.

656
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:41,920
And I don't think I'm
handling that very well.

657
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:46,160
I hurt.

658
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:49,160
All the time and...

659
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:54,080
Some things numb the pain, but.

660
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:59,440
I wake up in the morning and
it's still there, you know?

661
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:06,440
And I want to stop hurting, but
I can't stop hurting myself.

662
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:08,960
I mean, I can barely
even get into a car.

663
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:20,240
I try to cry sometimes and
then no tears come out,

664
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:22,160
because it's like
I have none left.

665
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:26,200
And I have a son.

666
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:33,920
And I can't help him,
he can't help me.

667
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:36,320
I can't be a father.

668
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:38,840
I mean, I don't know
what I'm supposed to do.

669
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:40,880
What am I supposed to
do with a child, huh?

670
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:41,640
Seriously.

671
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:46,120
- I don't know.

672
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:50,160
I don't, man.

673
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:53,080
I won't pretend to.

674
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:01,200
- Thanks.

675
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:06,280
Thanks for not pretending
to have all the answers.

676
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:18,440
- Come on, let me
take you to dinner

677
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:21,160
at that diner we used
to go to in high school.

678
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:23,680
- I don't know if
that's a good idea.

679
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:24,880
- Why not?

680
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:26,880
- I don't really
wanna get into a car.

681
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:28,240
I don't really wanna see people.

682
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:30,880
I don't wanna leave
the woods, the cabin.

683
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:32,960
It's quiet here.

684
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:37,200
I'm safe.

685
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:38,160
- Come on.

686
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:40,240
Come on.

687
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:44,240
We're going.

688
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:48,120
(Bobby sighs)

689
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:45,920
- How many?
- Two.

690
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:50,560
- Follow me.

691
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:53,040
This good?

692
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:53,800
- Perfect.

693
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:19,760
Startling, isn't it?

694
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:20,520
- What?

695
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:23,480
Did she say something?

696
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:24,680
- Who?

697
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:25,720
No, this place.

698
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:27,160
It's like it doesn't change.

699
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:29,880
It's like stuck in a time warp.

700
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:31,280
Even that waitress is the same.

701
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:33,880
- I think you're right.

702
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:40,400
Thanks for bringing me here.

703
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:41,680
- Yeah.

704
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:43,000
Sorry it isn't one of
those bougie restaurants

705
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,640
like you like to go
to in the city, but.

706
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:47,320
- Oh, that was Bridgette
that liked those.

707
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:50,080
I was always much
more comfortable in
a place like this.

708
00:53:50,080 --> 00:53:52,920
- (chuckles) Yep, my
sister turned into

709
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:53,880
quite a little snob.

710
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:57,600
- She liked the scene
every once in a while.

711
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:02,160
I know she was happiest
when she would have a book,

712
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:04,960
curled up by the fire
at the lake house.

713
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:11,920
I miss her.

714
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:15,960
- Yeah, me too.

715
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:28,280
Say, Bobby.

716
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:30,280
Susan and I were talking.

717
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:34,160
We'd love to have little
Gregory come stay with us,

718
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:35,720
you know, for a little while,

719
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:38,280
just till you get like, you
know, a little sturdier.

720
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:43,440
Yeah, my mom can't
look after him forever.

721
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:45,280
She's getting old

722
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:48,120
and it'll be really
good training wheels
for us, you know.

723
00:54:48,120 --> 00:54:49,760
Having a kid of our own.

724
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:51,360
It's all Susan talks about.

725
00:54:52,840 --> 00:54:55,640
You know, the doctor
said kinda tick tock, so.

726
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:00,520
- You really think
that's a good idea?

727
00:55:00,520 --> 00:55:01,280
- My mom does.

728
00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:04,080
- I know what Barbara
thinks about it.

729
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:06,320
- Yeah, but like, you know,
Susan and I discussed it

730
00:55:06,320 --> 00:55:09,200
with her and, you
know, we all agree

731
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:10,840
it's probably for the best.

732
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:14,840
Obviously we need, you
know, your go ahead, but.

733
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:16,440
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

734
00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:21,000
- What about your
work and daycare?

735
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:26,160
- Susan's actually
leaving her job,

736
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:29,080
so she can watch
Gregory full time.

737
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:32,680
- Well.

738
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,520
Let me think about it.
- Yeah.

739
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:43,040
- I don't know, man.

740
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:45,360
I'll have to check
with Bridgette.

741
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,480
- Well, you know, think it over.

742
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:50,800
Take all the time you need.

743
00:55:52,840 --> 00:55:55,360
- Have you all
decided what you want?

744
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:57,360
- I will have a cheeseburger,

745
00:55:57,360 --> 00:56:01,680
but instead of french
fries, I will have coleslaw.

746
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:04,800
- Order never changes,
ever since we were kids.

747
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:05,520
- And you?

748
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:08,160
- I always get the same thing,

749
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:12,280
but today I think I
want the meatloaf.

750
00:56:12,280 --> 00:56:15,240
But instead of french fries,
can I have a baked potato?

751
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:16,040
- [Waitress] Okay.

752
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:16,840
- Ooh!

753
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:17,960
- And to drink?

754
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:19,480
- Yeah, I'll have a Dos Equis.

755
00:56:21,160 --> 00:56:22,200
- Me, too.

756
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:23,960
- Okay, sounds good.

757
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:25,200
I'll get your order in

758
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:26,320
and I'll be right
back with your beers.

759
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:27,080
- Thank you.

760
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:31,640
I swear she hasn't changed.

761
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:36,160
- Rachel or.

762
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:40,640
I don't know, I didn't
see her name tag.

763
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:41,400
'Night.

764
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:53,120
Bridgette?

765
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:54,920
Are you here?

766
00:56:57,760 --> 00:57:00,120
(eerie music)

767
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:03,200
Oh my God!

768
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:05,600
Bridgette, what are you doing?

769
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:07,840
Why are you like this,
what's happening?

770
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:09,160
- Why are you giving
our son away, Bobby?

771
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:10,640
- What?

772
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:11,880
What?

773
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:13,160
What are you, what
are you talking about?

774
00:57:13,160 --> 00:57:15,280
- Can't you see what
they're trying to do?

775
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:16,360
They can't have a
child of their own,

776
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:17,640
so they're trying to take ours.

777
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:19,240
- No, Bridgette,
it's not like that.

778
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:20,840
- Then tell me what it is like.

779
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:23,600
I'm curious to hear
how you think this is

780
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:24,640
gonna play itself out.

781
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:25,920
- Oh, gosh.

782
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:27,840
You're so cold, let
me get you a blanket.

783
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:36,680
It's cold in here, Bridgette!

784
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:38,480
Thanks a lot!

785
00:57:56,920 --> 00:57:59,160
(screeching)

786
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:00,120
Bridgette!

787
00:58:01,120 --> 00:58:02,120
What are you doing?

788
00:58:02,120 --> 00:58:03,680
You're scaring me!

789
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:05,160
What are you doing out there?

790
00:58:05,160 --> 00:58:07,440
(crashing)

791
00:58:17,120 --> 00:58:18,360
Bridgette what are...

792
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:30,640
(lock clicking)

793
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:33,760
Oh.

794
00:58:35,560 --> 00:58:36,920
What am I doing?

795
00:58:43,880 --> 00:58:46,360
(line ringing)

796
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:51,080
- [Andrew] Hey,
you've reached Andrew.

797
00:58:51,080 --> 00:58:53,520
- Ah.
(ragged breathing)

798
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:54,920
I...

799
00:58:54,920 --> 00:58:55,720
Andrew?

800
00:58:55,720 --> 00:58:56,480
Hey, it's me.

801
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:01,520
Yeah, I just wanted to call and
say thanks again for dinner.

802
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:05,400
And (stammering)
I'm not seeing...

803
00:59:07,240 --> 00:59:08,200
I just...

804
00:59:09,560 --> 00:59:12,520
I'm not feeling too well and
I could use a little company.

805
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:15,160
I don't know if,

806
00:59:15,160 --> 00:59:16,880
no, I guess I
didn't mention that.

807
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:19,280
I guess I was too busy
(whispering quietly) myself.

808
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:20,560
Sorry, sorry.

809
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:22,080
Sorry, this is a
rambling message.

810
00:59:22,080 --> 00:59:23,120
I just...

811
00:59:23,120 --> 00:59:25,200
Yeah, give me a call
back when you get this.

812
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:28,640
And we can talk and maybe I'll
be a little more coherent.

813
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:34,000
You just, you know, like...
(screeching)

814
00:59:40,080 --> 00:59:42,720
(unlocking door)

815
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:52,720
- Maggie, you home?

816
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:54,920
Can I come over?

817
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:58,320
(Muzak playing)

818
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:01,600
(sighing)

819
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:22,120
Maggie!
(knocking)

820
01:00:22,120 --> 01:00:23,960
Oh, Maggie!
(knocking)

821
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:26,640
Maggie, sorry to bother you,
but I saw your light on,

822
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:28,320
so I came over.

823
01:00:28,320 --> 01:00:33,160
(stammering) I'm not
feeling too well.

824
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:44,200
- Hello.

825
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:45,480
- Hey.

826
01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:49,280
- Can I get this and
a bottle of Old Monk?

827
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:51,480
- Oh, sorry, all sold out.

828
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:53,040
- Sold out?

829
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:55,320
- Yeah, my wife delivered the
last case of it yesterday.

830
01:00:57,600 --> 01:00:59,240
- Oh, shit.

831
01:00:59,240 --> 01:01:04,040
I tied you up.

832
01:01:09,840 --> 01:01:11,640
- Must be some kinda
bachelorette party

833
01:01:11,640 --> 01:01:13,160
or something going
on up at the lake.

834
01:01:13,160 --> 01:01:14,480
- What?

835
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:15,800
- Yeah, I've never sold
so much of the stuff.

836
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:18,400
Next case won't be
in until next month.

837
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:19,320
I have other rums,
though, if you--

838
01:01:19,320 --> 01:01:20,240
- Hey, wait a minute, did you,

839
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:21,200
Did you sell it to this guy?

840
01:01:24,120 --> 01:01:24,880
- No.

841
01:01:26,200 --> 01:01:27,160
To her.

842
01:01:28,600 --> 01:01:31,240
- Come on, Bridgette,
why are you doing this?

843
01:01:31,240 --> 01:01:32,280
I didn't do anything!

844
01:01:34,120 --> 01:01:35,800
Nothing is gonna
happen to Gregory!

845
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:37,080
No one is gonna take him!

846
01:01:40,800 --> 01:01:43,200
I'm gonna have to walk back
home through the woods now!

847
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:44,280
Is that what you want?

848
01:01:54,120 --> 01:01:55,800
- All right.

849
01:01:55,800 --> 01:01:57,520
You know, the Captain
Morgan is really a lot--

850
01:01:57,520 --> 01:01:58,800
- Nah.

851
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:03,320
- You want your change?

852
01:02:03,320 --> 01:02:04,480
- [Andrew] No.

853
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:09,200
- Random.

854
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:11,960
(phone vibrating)

855
01:02:14,280 --> 01:02:16,880
(knocking on door)

856
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:19,360
- Maggie.

857
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:22,080
(phone vibrating)

858
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:26,800
Oh, she must be out.

859
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:31,720
(phone vibrating)

860
01:02:42,440 --> 01:02:44,800
(Bobby yawns)

861
01:02:46,920 --> 01:02:47,680
- Bobby!

862
01:02:48,760 --> 01:02:49,760
(knocking)

863
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:50,840
Bobby, you here?

864
01:02:50,840 --> 01:02:51,800
Bobby!

865
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:06,160
(mobile vibrating)

866
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:19,120
Bobby?

867
01:03:20,360 --> 01:03:21,600
Bobby, are you out there?

868
01:03:24,080 --> 01:03:24,800
Bobby!

869
01:03:27,080 --> 01:03:27,840
Hey!

870
01:03:27,840 --> 01:03:28,800
Hey, Bobby!

871
01:03:31,040 --> 01:03:31,800
Get up, Bobby!

872
01:03:35,560 --> 01:03:36,600
I'm coming, Bob!

873
01:03:45,560 --> 01:03:47,160
(car door shutting)

874
01:03:47,160 --> 01:03:47,920
Hello?

875
01:03:51,840 --> 01:03:52,600
Hello?

876
01:03:56,960 --> 01:03:57,760
Bobby?

877
01:03:57,760 --> 01:03:58,720
Hey!

878
01:03:59,800 --> 01:04:01,120
Bobby!

879
01:04:01,120 --> 01:04:02,000
Bobby, wake up!

880
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:02,800
- What?

881
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:03,840
What?

882
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:04,720
Wait, what's going on?

883
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:05,680
Where...

884
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:07,720
Where am I?

885
01:04:08,920 --> 01:04:10,960
- You're at a cabin
across the lake.

886
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:14,720
- It's cold.

887
01:04:17,680 --> 01:04:18,440
Oh.

888
01:04:19,640 --> 01:04:21,760
Oh, Bridgette took my boat.

889
01:04:23,240 --> 01:04:26,160
- Bridgette did not
take your boat, Bobby.

890
01:04:26,160 --> 01:04:27,080
You're in shock.

891
01:04:27,080 --> 01:04:28,760
What are you doing over here?

892
01:04:28,760 --> 01:04:32,400
- Miss Maggie's light was
on and I came over to...

893
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:36,560
I didn't want to be alone, I
should've asked you to stay.

894
01:04:36,560 --> 01:04:37,360
- What?

895
01:04:37,360 --> 01:04:38,160
Who is Maggie?

896
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:38,920
- Mrs. Moss.

897
01:04:39,800 --> 01:04:41,320
This is her house.

898
01:04:41,320 --> 01:04:43,320
She remembers you from
when you were a little kid.

899
01:04:43,320 --> 01:04:46,240
- Dude, the Mosses haven't
been up here in years.

900
01:04:46,240 --> 01:04:47,760
- No, I had lunch here.

901
01:04:50,240 --> 01:04:51,800
I had soup.

902
01:04:51,800 --> 01:04:53,520
- Soup?

903
01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:54,880
How many pills have you taken?

904
01:04:57,440 --> 01:04:58,200
- Some.

905
01:04:59,680 --> 01:05:00,920
- Have you been drinking?
- No.

906
01:05:00,920 --> 01:05:02,720
- Don't lie to me, Bobby.
- No.

907
01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:04,040
- I went to the liquor store.

908
01:05:04,040 --> 01:05:05,560
- No, no, no, no, I didn't
drink those, I just.

909
01:05:05,560 --> 01:05:07,400
I wanted to hear
what they had to say.

910
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:10,000
They don't talk
unless they're full.

911
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:12,880
- Okay, let's,

912
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:13,680
let's get you to
the hospital, man.

913
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:15,040
Can you stand?

914
01:05:15,040 --> 01:05:16,200
- Of course I can stand.

915
01:05:21,040 --> 01:05:22,120
Wait.

916
01:05:22,120 --> 01:05:22,920
- Hey.

917
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:23,680
- No, Maggie.

918
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:28,640
Maggie Was here.

919
01:05:31,160 --> 01:05:32,760
She was in there.

920
01:05:32,760 --> 01:05:35,440
- Look, man, we can talk
about it later, all right?

921
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:37,560
Let's just, let's get
you to the hospital.

922
01:05:37,560 --> 01:05:39,240
- No, I'm not,
don't take me there.

923
01:05:39,240 --> 01:05:41,080
- Bobby, I need to have
a doctor look at you.

924
01:05:41,080 --> 01:05:42,400
I don't know why
you're hallucinating.

925
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:43,920
- Don't take me there.

926
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:45,120
They let Bridgette die.

927
01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:48,520
- They didn't let Bridgette die.

928
01:05:48,520 --> 01:05:49,960
It was an accident, man.

929
01:05:49,960 --> 01:05:52,560
It was an accident.

930
01:05:52,560 --> 01:05:54,920
- I shoulda been the one
driving, it shoulda been me.

931
01:05:54,920 --> 01:05:56,680
- That's not how
it went, all right?

932
01:05:56,680 --> 01:05:57,840
It's just, it's not.

933
01:05:58,960 --> 01:05:59,720
Okay?

934
01:06:01,680 --> 01:06:03,640
Let's get you to a hospital.

935
01:06:03,640 --> 01:06:06,280
- No.

936
01:06:06,280 --> 01:06:07,480
Take me to the cabin.

937
01:06:07,480 --> 01:06:08,920
Take me to the
cabin, I'll warm up.

938
01:06:10,320 --> 01:06:14,880
I'll be fine.

939
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:16,360
- All right.

940
01:06:16,360 --> 01:06:18,600
Just, let's get in the car.

941
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:47,800
(loud banging)

942
01:06:47,800 --> 01:06:48,560
Bobby!

943
01:06:50,680 --> 01:06:52,760
- Whoa, how did that get here?

944
01:06:52,760 --> 01:06:54,360
Wait, that's weird.

945
01:06:54,360 --> 01:06:55,560
She brought the boat back.

946
01:06:55,560 --> 01:06:56,320
- Who?

947
01:06:56,320 --> 01:06:57,640
- Bridgette.

948
01:06:57,640 --> 01:07:00,040
- Robert, Bridgette did
not bring the boat back!

949
01:07:00,040 --> 01:07:01,800
- No, when I came down
here earlier to go home,

950
01:07:01,800 --> 01:07:03,040
she was sitting on it in
the middle of the lake

951
01:07:03,040 --> 01:07:04,760
and she was really angry at me!

952
01:07:04,760 --> 01:07:05,960
- What was she angry about?

953
01:07:05,960 --> 01:07:07,320
- She thought I was
giving away Gregory

954
01:07:07,320 --> 01:07:08,560
to you and Susan.

955
01:07:08,560 --> 01:07:10,320
- Dude, this is
getting ridiculous!

956
01:07:10,320 --> 01:07:11,680
What are you doing?

957
01:07:11,680 --> 01:07:13,000
- I'm going to tie the boat up.

958
01:07:16,280 --> 01:07:17,120
- What?

959
01:07:17,120 --> 01:07:18,480
What is that stuff?

960
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:19,480
Come on, Bobby.

961
01:07:19,480 --> 01:07:20,640
We're gonna go, all right?

962
01:07:20,640 --> 01:07:22,080
I'm thinking you
didn't tie the boat up,

963
01:07:22,080 --> 01:07:23,000
we'll grab it in the morning.

964
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:24,320
We gotta get you warm.

965
01:07:24,320 --> 01:07:25,640
- I threw all that
stuff in the lake!

966
01:07:25,640 --> 01:07:27,640
- Bobby, I don't know
what you think you--

967
01:07:27,640 --> 01:07:28,760
- Look, did you see that?

968
01:07:28,760 --> 01:07:29,960
- What?

969
01:07:29,960 --> 01:07:30,720
- The curtain just
moved in Maggie's house,

970
01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:31,960
she's gotta be home now.

971
01:07:31,960 --> 01:07:34,760
- Bobby, no one has
been there in 10 years!

972
01:07:34,760 --> 01:07:36,200
Why can't you see that?

973
01:07:36,200 --> 01:07:36,960
I told you.

974
01:07:41,040 --> 01:07:42,600
This is a bad idea!

975
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:45,480
Look, that is a very,
very bad idea, man.

976
01:07:45,480 --> 01:07:46,760
We've had enough
drama for one night,

977
01:07:46,760 --> 01:07:47,840
let's go home.

978
01:07:47,840 --> 01:07:48,800
- No, I have to see.

979
01:07:51,640 --> 01:07:52,440
I was here.

980
01:07:52,440 --> 01:07:54,760
This was so real.

981
01:07:56,160 --> 01:07:57,920
- Bobby, I will bring you
back first thing tomorrow

982
01:07:57,920 --> 01:08:00,280
and you can look around
to your heart's content

983
01:08:00,280 --> 01:08:01,720
in the daytime, okay?

984
01:08:04,520 --> 01:08:05,440
Come on.

985
01:08:05,440 --> 01:08:07,480
- What is happening to me?

986
01:08:39,880 --> 01:08:40,800
Is this a dream?

987
01:08:40,800 --> 01:08:41,680
Is this just a bad dream?

988
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:43,400
- What?

989
01:08:45,040 --> 01:08:46,800
What are you talking about?

990
01:08:46,800 --> 01:08:47,560
- This.

991
01:08:48,840 --> 01:08:50,840
I can't tell what's real
and what's fake anymore.

992
01:08:51,720 --> 01:08:54,040
- This is real, Bobby.

993
01:08:54,040 --> 01:08:54,840
Okay?

994
01:08:54,840 --> 01:08:56,520
All this is real.

995
01:08:58,280 --> 01:09:01,080
Look, man, I think you've
suffered a traumatic experience

996
01:09:01,080 --> 01:09:04,800
and it's making you hear
things and see things

997
01:09:06,320 --> 01:09:09,360
and believe things
that don't exist, okay?

998
01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:12,920
And you couple that with
a lot of self medication

999
01:09:12,920 --> 01:09:14,400
and voila!

1000
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:15,640
- Psychotic break?

1001
01:09:15,640 --> 01:09:17,800
- Hey, I don't know what
they'd call it, but.

1002
01:09:20,120 --> 01:09:21,800
- I know.

1003
01:09:21,800 --> 01:09:23,080
- Bobby.

1004
01:09:23,080 --> 01:09:24,680
I'm not judging you, all right?

1005
01:09:25,720 --> 01:09:27,000
I have no idea what
you're going through,

1006
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:28,720
losing the love of
your life like that,

1007
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:33,440
but she was my
little sister, okay?

1008
01:09:33,440 --> 01:09:36,560
It's been tough on all of us.

1009
01:09:36,560 --> 01:09:37,680
Especially you and my mom.

1010
01:09:39,440 --> 01:09:40,400
- Barbara was right.

1011
01:09:43,080 --> 01:09:46,320
It should've been
me, it would've been
easier if I'd died.

1012
01:09:46,320 --> 01:09:48,480
I just, I don't
know if I can go on.

1013
01:09:48,480 --> 01:09:50,000
Bridgette was so much stronger.

1014
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:50,800
I just, I can't.

1015
01:09:52,880 --> 01:09:54,480
- Bobby.

1016
01:09:54,480 --> 01:09:57,880
Hey, let's get you inside, man.

1017
01:09:57,880 --> 01:09:58,840
Okay?

1018
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:01,760
- Okay.

1019
01:10:09,720 --> 01:10:12,480
- Cool?
- And Andrew, don't leave me.

1020
01:10:12,480 --> 01:10:14,480
Don't leave me even
for a second, okay?

1021
01:10:14,480 --> 01:10:15,800
- Okay.

1022
01:10:15,800 --> 01:10:17,480
- That's when she comes,
that's when she comes for me.

1023
01:10:17,480 --> 01:10:18,760
- Look, I won't, man, all right?

1024
01:10:18,760 --> 01:10:20,600
- And I'm the only
one who can see her.

1025
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:23,360
Her and General Washington.

1026
01:10:24,760 --> 01:10:25,720
- What?

1027
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:30,840
- I sometimes see
General Washington, too,

1028
01:10:30,840 --> 01:10:32,640
in the lake and in the woods.

1029
01:10:34,360 --> 01:10:36,160
I thought it was
reenactors at first,

1030
01:10:36,160 --> 01:10:37,880
but now I'm not so sure.

1031
01:10:37,880 --> 01:10:39,840
- Oh, boy.

1032
01:10:42,200 --> 01:10:43,760
Okay, yeah.

1033
01:10:43,760 --> 01:10:45,800
Let's go inside.

1034
01:10:52,600 --> 01:10:53,960
Classic.

1035
01:10:53,960 --> 01:10:55,320
Well, at least the car started.

1036
01:10:55,320 --> 01:10:57,720
- Oh, the light's
been flickering.

1037
01:10:59,120 --> 01:11:00,080
Something must be loose.

1038
01:11:00,080 --> 01:11:01,920
I keep meaning to check it out.

1039
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:02,680
- You should.

1040
01:11:04,720 --> 01:11:06,320
I'm just gonna
start a fire, man.

1041
01:11:06,320 --> 01:11:07,280
- All right.

1042
01:11:09,280 --> 01:11:10,840
- Hey, get over here, man.

1043
01:11:10,840 --> 01:11:12,800
Warm up now.

1044
01:11:17,800 --> 01:11:19,080
I'm gonna get you
a blanket, too.

1045
01:11:19,880 --> 01:11:21,720
- Oh, that sounds nice.

1046
01:11:21,720 --> 01:11:22,680
Oh, and a shot, too.

1047
01:11:24,720 --> 01:11:25,800
- Okay.

1048
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:27,520
Just this once.

1049
01:11:27,520 --> 01:11:28,720
I'm gonna have one, too.

1050
01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:32,960
- Oh, wait, I'll get it!

1051
01:11:34,200 --> 01:11:34,960
- [Andrew] Robert.

1052
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:37,520
- I can explain that.
- Can you?

1053
01:11:38,840 --> 01:11:39,920
- They just showed up.

1054
01:11:41,680 --> 01:11:42,520
They're very wise.

1055
01:11:44,080 --> 01:11:47,080
- Yeah, that's not really
a great explanation, Bobby.

1056
01:11:47,080 --> 01:11:48,200
- They're all I've got.

1057
01:11:49,680 --> 01:11:51,400
- Dude, you named them?

1058
01:11:51,400 --> 01:11:52,240
- They have names.

1059
01:11:53,520 --> 01:11:54,920
They'll tell you, if you listen.

1060
01:11:57,880 --> 01:12:01,040
(eerie music)

1061
01:12:01,040 --> 01:12:04,480
It's her.

1062
01:12:04,480 --> 01:12:05,680
She was just there, I swear!

1063
01:12:05,680 --> 01:12:07,960
- You gotta stop doing
this to yourself, man.

1064
01:12:09,520 --> 01:12:10,360
Bridgette is gone.

1065
01:12:12,280 --> 01:12:13,880
- It was so real.

1066
01:12:13,880 --> 01:12:16,280
- Tomorrow morning I am
taking you to a doctor.

1067
01:12:16,280 --> 01:12:18,480
If you don't wanna go
to the hospital up here,

1068
01:12:18,480 --> 01:12:20,560
I'll take you to one
in the city, but.

1069
01:12:20,560 --> 01:12:22,240
- Andrew?
- Yes?

1070
01:12:22,240 --> 01:12:23,160
- I'm scared, man.

1071
01:12:24,720 --> 01:12:26,400
I don't think I'm gonna
make it through the night.

1072
01:12:26,400 --> 01:12:28,320
- Of course you are.

1073
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:30,840
- No, I got a bad
feeling about this night.

1074
01:12:30,840 --> 01:12:33,880
- Bobby, I will stay up
the entire night with you.

1075
01:12:33,880 --> 01:12:35,400
- I don't think you can stop it.

1076
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:37,920
- What are you saying?

1077
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:39,560
- I don't know, I don't know.

1078
01:12:39,560 --> 01:12:41,400
It's gonna be a long night.

1079
01:12:41,400 --> 01:12:42,520
- Uh-huh.

1080
01:12:42,520 --> 01:12:45,080
- People can die of
fright, can't they?

1081
01:12:45,080 --> 01:12:47,520
(loud banging)

1082
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:53,520
- Okay, that is weird.

1083
01:12:55,600 --> 01:12:56,360
- See?

1084
01:12:57,560 --> 01:12:58,760
- I thought you tied it up--

1085
01:12:58,760 --> 01:13:00,400
- See, I told you
something was going on!

1086
01:13:00,400 --> 01:13:02,320
- Under no circumstance are
you to go get in that boat.

1087
01:13:02,320 --> 01:13:04,480
- You don't have
to tell me twice.

1088
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:05,440
- All right, but.

1089
01:13:07,480 --> 01:13:09,080
I'm gonna go tie it up

1090
01:13:09,080 --> 01:13:10,840
so we don't have to deal
with this in the morning.

1091
01:13:20,720 --> 01:13:22,560
- Hey, look.

1092
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:26,440
It's empty now.

1093
01:13:26,440 --> 01:13:28,640
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa,
where'd all that stuff go?

1094
01:13:28,640 --> 01:13:30,480
- I don't know, man.

1095
01:13:30,480 --> 01:13:32,280
I don't care.

1096
01:13:38,560 --> 01:13:39,360
- [Bobby] Ho!

1097
01:13:39,360 --> 01:13:40,160
- Whoa, whoa!

1098
01:13:40,160 --> 01:13:41,520
All right, screw this.

1099
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:42,520
Let's go back inside.

1100
01:13:50,360 --> 01:13:52,040
I never thought I'd
lock the door up here.

1101
01:13:52,040 --> 01:13:54,600
- I started locking it after
those reenactors got lost.

1102
01:13:55,560 --> 01:13:56,400
(Bobby shouts)
- Ah!

1103
01:13:57,880 --> 01:13:59,720
Dude, you gotta relax,
there's no one there.

1104
01:13:59,720 --> 01:14:01,000
- You just can't see her!

1105
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:02,520
- All right, that's it, man.

1106
01:14:02,520 --> 01:14:03,840
Get your stuff, we're getting
out of here, all right?

1107
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:05,400
- Oh no, no, no, no,
we're not going out there.

1108
01:14:05,400 --> 01:14:06,680
- Yeah, we are, all right?

1109
01:14:06,680 --> 01:14:08,360
Pack up your things,
I'm gonna call my mom,

1110
01:14:08,360 --> 01:14:09,760
I'm gonna tell her
we're coming over there.

1111
01:14:09,760 --> 01:14:11,160
- What makes you think we're
gonna be safer over there?

1112
01:14:11,160 --> 01:14:12,560
- I don't know, but like,

1113
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:15,880
we'll be near civilization and
I'll be near a sane person.

1114
01:14:15,880 --> 01:14:17,160
- I don't know, man,

1115
01:14:17,160 --> 01:14:17,800
I don't know if I can
make it to the car

1116
01:14:17,800 --> 01:14:18,760
I just, I can't.

1117
01:14:18,760 --> 01:14:20,400
- Dude, what are you seeing?

1118
01:14:20,400 --> 01:14:21,880
- I'm seeing Bridgette.

1119
01:14:21,880 --> 01:14:25,480
And she looks so angry,
like she's possessed.

1120
01:14:25,480 --> 01:14:26,440
- Okay, that's it.

1121
01:14:26,440 --> 01:14:27,760
I'm gonna grab your stuff.

1122
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:29,560
- Okay, okay.

1123
01:14:31,240 --> 01:14:32,000
- Huh.

1124
01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:35,920
- What?

1125
01:14:35,920 --> 01:14:37,480
- It's super late and
I'm getting a busy signal

1126
01:14:37,480 --> 01:14:38,400
at my mom's house.

1127
01:14:38,400 --> 01:14:40,000
- Maybe she's on the phone or--

1128
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:41,760
- When was the last time you
heard a busy signal, man?

1129
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:43,320
- Well, try my phone.

1130
01:14:48,440 --> 01:14:51,600
- (gulps) That's not good.

1131
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:54,120
- It can't be dead,
I had a full charge.

1132
01:14:54,120 --> 01:14:55,600
- Whatever, man, she'll
be happy to see you.

1133
01:14:55,600 --> 01:14:56,400
(pounding)

1134
01:14:56,400 --> 01:14:57,360
- Oh, what was that?

1135
01:14:59,040 --> 01:15:00,560
- Maybe a bird hit the window.

1136
01:15:00,560 --> 01:15:01,360
- At this hour?

1137
01:15:01,360 --> 01:15:02,440
- What, like, or a bat?

1138
01:15:03,800 --> 01:15:05,160
- Oh, you're not
going out there!

1139
01:15:05,160 --> 01:15:07,240
- I'm going to go see
what that was, Bobby.

1140
01:15:09,840 --> 01:15:10,960
Ew.

1141
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:11,840
- [Bobby] What is it?

1142
01:15:12,760 --> 01:15:14,240
- Frogs.
- Frogs?

1143
01:15:16,160 --> 01:15:17,920
- Yeah.
- Oh.

1144
01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:19,560
Well, what are they doing
flying at the window?

1145
01:15:19,560 --> 01:15:21,160
- Look, man, I don't think
it's their decision, okay?

1146
01:15:21,160 --> 01:15:22,080
We're getting out of here!

1147
01:15:22,080 --> 01:15:23,560
- Those frogs are like biblical.

1148
01:15:23,560 --> 01:15:24,920
- I've heard that
sometimes in storms

1149
01:15:24,920 --> 01:15:26,560
the wind can whip 'em up.

1150
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:27,640
- Well, it's not storming!

1151
01:15:27,640 --> 01:15:29,600
- Not yet, man, which
is why we're going now.

1152
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:30,880
Because I'm not
getting stuck in here

1153
01:15:30,880 --> 01:15:32,200
with a storm that's
strong enough to throw

1154
01:15:32,200 --> 01:15:33,400
freakin' frogs around with you!

1155
01:15:33,400 --> 01:15:34,520
- All right, I don't
even need to pack.

1156
01:15:34,520 --> 01:15:36,000
We'll come back for it tomorrow.

1157
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,960
(jostling door)

1158
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:40,160
- Unlock it, Bobby.

1159
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:43,240
(lock clicks)
(wind gusting)

1160
01:15:43,240 --> 01:15:44,000
- Oh, shit!

1161
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:46,280
I didn't do that.

1162
01:15:46,280 --> 01:15:47,640
- Yeah, it was the
wind, all right?

1163
01:15:47,640 --> 01:15:49,320
Because it's not storming
yet, but it is coming.

1164
01:15:50,760 --> 01:15:53,240
If we're going, that
is the sign to go now.

1165
01:15:55,720 --> 01:15:57,520
- I don't care if it makes
me sound like a pussy,

1166
01:15:57,520 --> 01:15:58,920
I'm so fucking scared.

1167
01:15:58,920 --> 01:16:00,480
- Everything's gonna
be fine, Bobby.

1168
01:16:00,480 --> 01:16:02,000
We're just gonna get in
the car and we're gonna go.

1169
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:02,920
(keys jangling)
(splash)

1170
01:16:02,920 --> 01:16:03,720
Shit!

1171
01:16:03,720 --> 01:16:04,760
- What?

1172
01:16:04,760 --> 01:16:06,080
- Nothing.
- What?

1173
01:16:06,080 --> 01:16:07,480
What, I don't like
the sound of that.

1174
01:16:07,480 --> 01:16:09,480
- Just go to the car, Bobby,
you're still freaking me out.

1175
01:16:16,200 --> 01:16:18,280
Bobby, I need you to promise
me you're going to stay calm.

1176
01:16:18,280 --> 01:16:19,200
- Why, what happened?

1177
01:16:19,200 --> 01:16:20,400
- Just, are you gonna stay calm?

1178
01:16:20,400 --> 01:16:21,440
- Why, what happened?

1179
01:16:21,440 --> 01:16:22,680
- That sound you heard?

1180
01:16:22,680 --> 01:16:23,960
When I pulled my phone
out of my pocket,

1181
01:16:23,960 --> 01:16:25,080
I dropped the keys in the lake.

1182
01:16:25,080 --> 01:16:26,000
- What?

1183
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:26,760
- You got me on edge, man!

1184
01:16:26,760 --> 01:16:28,200
I'm doing stupid stuff.

1185
01:16:29,480 --> 01:16:31,280
Just, look, I can
call the company,

1186
01:16:31,280 --> 01:16:33,200
they can open it and start
it from the satellite.

1187
01:16:33,200 --> 01:16:34,480
- Well, call them!

1188
01:16:34,480 --> 01:16:35,680
- That's what I'm doing.

1189
01:16:41,680 --> 01:16:46,440
(sighs) Come on.

1190
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:51,280
Hi, this is Andrew Burns.

1191
01:16:52,440 --> 01:16:55,560
I just lost my keys in a lake.

1192
01:16:55,560 --> 01:16:56,320
Yeah.

1193
01:16:58,200 --> 01:17:00,600
I just need you to
open it and start it.

1194
01:17:00,600 --> 01:17:03,440
And the password is interzone.

1195
01:17:03,440 --> 01:17:04,200
Yeah.

1196
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:06,280
Uh-huh.

1197
01:17:08,480 --> 01:17:09,280
(car alarm beeps)

1198
01:17:09,280 --> 01:17:10,360
- Oh!

1199
01:17:10,360 --> 01:17:11,320
- My God, thank you.

1200
01:17:13,120 --> 01:17:15,360
(rock music)

1201
01:17:31,040 --> 01:17:32,480
- Oh, thank God for technology.

1202
01:17:32,480 --> 01:17:33,520
I was about to lose my shit.

1203
01:17:33,520 --> 01:17:35,400
- See, like I said,
nothing to worry about.

1204
01:17:35,400 --> 01:17:36,640
- Don't say stuff like that.

1205
01:17:36,640 --> 01:17:37,920
We still have to
get out of here.

1206
01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:38,720
- You're right, I'll--

1207
01:17:38,720 --> 01:17:39,640
- Whoa, look out!

1208
01:17:39,640 --> 01:17:41,560
- What the hell is your problem?

1209
01:17:41,560 --> 01:17:42,880
- You didn't see her?

1210
01:17:42,880 --> 01:17:45,400
- Bobby, if you say Bridgette,
so help me god, I will.

1211
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:47,720
I don't know what I'll do.

1212
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:49,520
- Well.

1213
01:17:51,200 --> 01:17:53,000
I'm not gonna say
it, but it was her.

1214
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:54,520
- Dude.

1215
01:17:54,520 --> 01:17:55,880
I was gonna try and
let tonight slide

1216
01:17:55,880 --> 01:17:57,240
after we got to my mom's house,

1217
01:17:57,240 --> 01:18:00,920
but now I really
don't think I can.

1218
01:18:00,920 --> 01:18:04,120
You're clearly a danger
to others and yourself.

1219
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:08,000
Get in the back seat.

1220
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:10,480
Get in the back!

1221
01:18:10,480 --> 01:18:11,440
- Okay.

1222
01:18:15,960 --> 01:18:17,520
I can't believe
you didn't see her.

1223
01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:20,200
- I didn't see her, Bobby,
because she's not there, okay?

1224
01:18:20,200 --> 01:18:21,440
- Well, she's very real to me.

1225
01:18:21,440 --> 01:18:23,360
- Yeah, I can see that

1226
01:18:23,360 --> 01:18:25,320
and we're gonna get
you some help, okay?

1227
01:18:26,440 --> 01:18:28,400
- What about the boat?

1228
01:18:28,400 --> 01:18:30,440
The stuff in the
boat, the frogs.

1229
01:18:30,440 --> 01:18:32,360
- You think Bridgette
is doing that?

1230
01:18:32,360 --> 01:18:33,280
How, Bobby?

1231
01:18:33,280 --> 01:18:35,360
That doesn't make any sense.

1232
01:18:35,360 --> 01:18:36,480
- No, she's mad at me!

1233
01:18:36,480 --> 01:18:37,760
She thinks that I'm
giving Gregory away

1234
01:18:37,760 --> 01:18:40,000
or that I can't take
care of him on my own.

1235
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:41,480
She's trying to
snap me out of it.

1236
01:18:41,480 --> 01:18:45,480
- Nobody is gonna take Gregory
away from you, Bobby, okay?

1237
01:18:45,480 --> 01:18:47,480
Now just promise me
you're not gonna do

1238
01:18:47,480 --> 01:18:50,400
anything else stupid and
let's get to my mom's house.

1239
01:18:52,240 --> 01:18:53,520
(engine dying)

1240
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:57,080
- Whoa, wait, what was that?

1241
01:18:59,200 --> 01:19:00,880
- The engine just died.

1242
01:19:00,880 --> 01:19:03,240
- Well, call them back
and have them restart it.

1243
01:19:06,440 --> 01:19:08,560
- Hi, this is Andrew Burns.

1244
01:19:08,560 --> 01:19:11,760
I just called a few minutes
ago to have my car started.

1245
01:19:11,760 --> 01:19:13,680
Yeah, well, it's just
died on me again.

1246
01:19:14,680 --> 01:19:15,480
Could you?

1247
01:19:15,480 --> 01:19:16,440
Oh, thanks.

1248
01:19:19,040 --> 01:19:20,960
Nope, nothing is happening.

1249
01:19:21,880 --> 01:19:23,960
Yeah, the password is interzone.

1250
01:19:25,440 --> 01:19:27,440
Could you just try it again?

1251
01:19:27,440 --> 01:19:29,440
No, tomorrow is not good, okay?

1252
01:19:29,440 --> 01:19:31,840
I have to get to
work in the morning.

1253
01:19:34,160 --> 01:19:35,560
No.

1254
01:19:35,560 --> 01:19:36,520
No!

1255
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:40,400
- Wait.

1256
01:19:40,400 --> 01:19:42,680
That doesn't sound good.

1257
01:19:42,680 --> 01:19:45,680
- Yeah, well, that's 'cause
it's not good, Bobby!

1258
01:19:45,680 --> 01:19:47,320
Right now I need
you to remain calm.

1259
01:19:47,320 --> 01:19:48,080
- I am calm!

1260
01:19:49,400 --> 01:19:51,400
- With the swift jerky
movement of the car

1261
01:19:51,400 --> 01:19:54,240
you just had us make and the
fact that I just called them

1262
01:19:54,240 --> 01:19:56,360
to have them unlock
it and start it,

1263
01:19:56,360 --> 01:19:59,480
their security team has ruled
this suspicious behavior

1264
01:19:59,480 --> 01:20:00,400
and killed my engine.

1265
01:20:00,400 --> 01:20:01,400
- Wait, they can do that?

1266
01:20:01,400 --> 01:20:02,400
- They just did, so--

1267
01:20:02,400 --> 01:20:03,800
- Well, didn't you tell them?

1268
01:20:03,800 --> 01:20:05,320
- Yeah, I did tell them.

1269
01:20:07,800 --> 01:20:09,080
- So what do we do now?

1270
01:20:09,080 --> 01:20:11,000
- We wait until
tomorrow morning,

1271
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:13,520
when someone comes
from the local garage

1272
01:20:13,520 --> 01:20:15,360
and verifies that I'm me.

1273
01:20:18,680 --> 01:20:20,280
- Shh!

1274
01:20:20,280 --> 01:20:21,600
- What do you think, you think
someone's gonna come get us?

1275
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:24,040
Like George Washington's
gonna stab us with a bayonet?

1276
01:20:24,040 --> 01:20:25,400
- I don't know!

1277
01:20:25,400 --> 01:20:28,240
- Bobby, the only dangerous
thing I see around here

1278
01:20:28,240 --> 01:20:29,880
is you, okay?

1279
01:20:29,880 --> 01:20:30,800
It's you!

1280
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:31,720
- Call Barbara, call your mom.

1281
01:20:31,720 --> 01:20:33,480
Have her come pick us up.

1282
01:20:33,480 --> 01:20:34,880
- It's like two AM.

1283
01:20:34,880 --> 01:20:35,800
I'm not calling my mom to
tell her to come get us

1284
01:20:35,800 --> 01:20:37,360
'cause we're scared of the dark!

1285
01:20:37,360 --> 01:20:39,800
- Yes, that's exactly what
you're gonna tell her!

1286
01:20:39,800 --> 01:20:41,240
- No.
- No, call her.

1287
01:20:41,240 --> 01:20:42,200
- This is ridiculous.

1288
01:20:42,200 --> 01:20:43,440
You're losing your shit, man.

1289
01:20:43,440 --> 01:20:44,560
- Well, tell her that!

1290
01:20:44,560 --> 01:20:45,560
Tell her that I'm losing my shit

1291
01:20:45,560 --> 01:20:46,680
and she needs to
come pick us up!

1292
01:20:46,680 --> 01:20:48,360
- Okay, all right.

1293
01:20:48,360 --> 01:20:50,440
Well, that might actually work.

1294
01:20:50,440 --> 01:20:51,480
Can we just go inside?

1295
01:20:51,480 --> 01:20:52,600
- Just call her.

1296
01:20:52,600 --> 01:20:53,760
I'm not gonna make
it to the morning.

1297
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:54,880
I think I'm gonna crack.

1298
01:20:54,880 --> 01:20:56,440
- I think you've
already cracked.

1299
01:20:59,240 --> 01:21:00,120
Okay, okay.

1300
01:21:05,760 --> 01:21:08,400
(Andrew sighs)

1301
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:11,760
- Hey, Mom.

1302
01:21:12,800 --> 01:21:14,440
Sorry to bother you so late,

1303
01:21:14,440 --> 01:21:16,480
but if you get this could
you give me a call back?

1304
01:21:16,480 --> 01:21:18,400
Bobby isn't feeling so well

1305
01:21:18,400 --> 01:21:21,440
and I was gonna bring him
over to your house, but.

1306
01:21:21,440 --> 01:21:23,120
Long story short
is my car is dead

1307
01:21:23,120 --> 01:21:24,840
and then we've gotta
wait till the morning

1308
01:21:24,840 --> 01:21:26,720
for the garage guy to come and,

1309
01:21:26,720 --> 01:21:30,160
just, just if you get this
can you just call me back?

1310
01:21:30,160 --> 01:21:32,440
Service at the cabin
is terrible, so just...

1311
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:36,000
Just keep trying till
you get me, okay?

1312
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:38,040
Thanks.

1313
01:21:41,360 --> 01:21:42,600
- So.

1314
01:21:42,600 --> 01:21:43,360
So now what?

1315
01:21:45,080 --> 01:21:47,560
- Well, I don't
know about you, man,

1316
01:21:47,560 --> 01:21:48,960
but I'm going inside.

1317
01:21:48,960 --> 01:21:51,480
I'm gonna start a fire and
try and get some sleep.

1318
01:21:56,120 --> 01:21:57,360
- I think I'm gonna stay here.

1319
01:21:59,720 --> 01:22:00,480
- Suit yourself.

1320
01:22:01,720 --> 01:22:03,160
- Oh, you're just
gonna leave me here?

1321
01:22:03,160 --> 01:22:04,480
- Leave you?

1322
01:22:04,480 --> 01:22:07,040
I told you to come
inside, you don't want to.

1323
01:22:07,040 --> 01:22:08,920
So I'm gonna go inside,
I'm gonna start a fire,

1324
01:22:08,920 --> 01:22:10,720
and I'm gonna try
and get some sleep.

1325
01:22:12,920 --> 01:22:14,520
- Well, I'm gonna stay here!

1326
01:22:14,520 --> 01:22:16,440
- Do you really think that
you're safer out here?

1327
01:22:16,440 --> 01:22:17,920
- I don't know.

1328
01:22:17,920 --> 01:22:19,400
I don't know why I should be
safer or less safe anywhere.

1329
01:22:19,400 --> 01:22:20,440
- Yeah, exactly!

1330
01:22:20,440 --> 01:22:22,560
But it seems like
you're safer with me.

1331
01:22:22,560 --> 01:22:24,920
So come on, Bobby.

1332
01:22:24,920 --> 01:22:26,640
Get out of the car.

1333
01:22:26,640 --> 01:22:27,400
- No.

1334
01:22:32,280 --> 01:22:35,040
(thunder rolling)

1335
01:23:14,920 --> 01:23:17,960
(loud banging)
- Ah!

1336
01:23:24,160 --> 01:23:26,400
- Relax, man, it's just me.

1337
01:23:28,920 --> 01:23:31,400
I tackled Abe Lincoln
to get that for you.

1338
01:23:31,400 --> 01:23:32,440
- Very funny.

1339
01:23:32,440 --> 01:23:34,080
Abe Lincoln's not
even from around here.

1340
01:23:34,080 --> 01:23:34,880
- What?

1341
01:23:34,880 --> 01:23:35,640
He's also dead.

1342
01:23:37,160 --> 01:23:38,760
- [Andrew] Are you really
gonna stay out here all night?

1343
01:23:38,760 --> 01:23:39,520
- Yes.

1344
01:23:41,120 --> 01:23:42,360
I feel safer out in the car.

1345
01:23:43,760 --> 01:23:45,320
- You sure?
- Yes, thank you.

1346
01:23:46,760 --> 01:23:47,680
- Sure?

1347
01:23:47,680 --> 01:23:48,600
I got a really big fire going.

1348
01:23:49,880 --> 01:23:52,440
And actually, I
bumped into Jesus--

1349
01:23:52,440 --> 01:23:53,880
- Okay.

1350
01:23:53,880 --> 01:23:55,320
- You know, he's gonna
pop in for a nightcap.

1351
01:23:55,320 --> 01:23:56,640
- Mm-hmm, yeah, great.

1352
01:23:56,640 --> 01:23:58,200
- Turns out he's a really
big fan of Old Monk.

1353
01:23:58,200 --> 01:23:59,320
- Oh, wonderful.

1354
01:23:59,320 --> 01:24:00,520
- I mean, it make sense.

1355
01:24:00,520 --> 01:24:02,120
- It's very funny,
that's very, very funny.

1356
01:24:02,120 --> 01:24:02,880
- I thought so.

1357
01:24:03,960 --> 01:24:05,280
- I'll be fine, thank you.

1358
01:24:08,440 --> 01:24:10,560
- (quietly) You're welcome.

1359
01:24:10,560 --> 01:24:11,480
All right.

1360
01:24:11,480 --> 01:24:13,240
Night, Bobby.
- 'Night.

1361
01:24:36,320 --> 01:24:38,760
(wind blowing)

1362
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:55,560
What the fuck, Bridgette?

1363
01:24:55,560 --> 01:24:56,880
Are you trying to kill me?

1364
01:25:00,760 --> 01:25:01,520
- Bobby?

1365
01:25:03,120 --> 01:25:04,680
Please don't tell me you're
talking to Bridgette again.

1366
01:25:04,680 --> 01:25:06,640
I've had about
enough of this, man.

1367
01:25:06,640 --> 01:25:07,560
What?

1368
01:25:07,560 --> 01:25:08,760
Why did you move my car?

1369
01:25:08,760 --> 01:25:10,680
- It slipped into gear.

1370
01:25:10,680 --> 01:25:12,880
- I'm gonna pretend
you didn't say that.

1371
01:25:12,880 --> 01:25:14,560
- It started rolling
toward the lake

1372
01:25:14,560 --> 01:25:16,480
and I hit the emergency brake.

1373
01:25:16,480 --> 01:25:17,320
Did you put it on?

1374
01:25:17,320 --> 01:25:18,400
- I don't know, man.

1375
01:25:18,400 --> 01:25:19,880
I'm exhausted, it's a habit.

1376
01:25:19,880 --> 01:25:22,320
Like, I don't know,
I'm super stressed out.

1377
01:25:22,320 --> 01:25:23,800
Are you staying out here or not?

1378
01:25:26,200 --> 01:25:27,400
- No, I'm coming in.

1379
01:25:27,400 --> 01:25:29,200
- Good, that's settled.

1380
01:25:30,720 --> 01:25:31,480
Come on.

1381
01:25:34,040 --> 01:25:36,880
And I fixed that fuse,
so the light's on.

1382
01:25:41,440 --> 01:25:42,760
- You can take the bed.

1383
01:25:42,760 --> 01:25:44,960
I'm gonna curl up by
the fire in the blanket.

1384
01:25:45,880 --> 01:25:46,800
- [Andrew] You sure?

1385
01:25:46,800 --> 01:25:47,560
- Yeah.

1386
01:25:48,840 --> 01:25:51,600
I'm not gonna be doing
much sleeping anyway.

1387
01:25:51,600 --> 01:25:52,360
- Suit yourself.

1388
01:25:55,800 --> 01:25:57,600
Well, if you change your mind.

1389
01:25:57,600 --> 01:25:59,560
- [Bobby] I'm all right.

1390
01:26:06,520 --> 01:26:09,360
(fire crackling)

1391
01:26:13,920 --> 01:26:16,680
(thunder rolling)

1392
01:26:23,640 --> 01:26:27,520
(wind blowing)
(loud slamming)

1393
01:26:27,520 --> 01:26:30,560
Andrew, you still awake?

1394
01:26:30,560 --> 01:26:33,160
(footsteps approaching)

1395
01:26:33,160 --> 01:26:35,520
(Bobby gasps)

1396
01:26:36,960 --> 01:26:38,720
- I heard something
too, that time.

1397
01:26:38,720 --> 01:26:40,160
- [Bobby] Oh, thank God.

1398
01:26:40,160 --> 01:26:41,480
- I thought it was the wind,

1399
01:26:41,480 --> 01:26:42,600
but I waited then
I heard footsteps.

1400
01:26:44,760 --> 01:26:45,760
- Oh, it's Bridgette.

1401
01:26:47,360 --> 01:26:50,560
- Do you see her right now?
- No, but it had to be her.

1402
01:26:50,560 --> 01:26:52,760
- What does she want?

1403
01:26:52,760 --> 01:26:54,400
- I don't know.

1404
01:26:54,400 --> 01:26:58,360
I think she's trying to
warn me about something.

1405
01:27:01,760 --> 01:27:04,400
- Are you gonna close the door?

1406
01:27:07,120 --> 01:27:08,480
- Could you do it?

1407
01:27:11,200 --> 01:27:14,760
- I think it's probably
better if you do it.

1408
01:27:23,240 --> 01:27:26,520
(floorboards creaking)

1409
01:27:39,120 --> 01:27:41,880
(thunder rolling)

1410
01:28:22,800 --> 01:28:24,320
(knocking)

1411
01:28:24,480 --> 01:28:26,000
- [Barbara] Why did
you lock the door?

1412
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:27,800
- Oh, shit.

1413
01:28:27,800 --> 01:28:28,560
Coming, Mom.

1414
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:36,880
- I got the message
you left last night

1415
01:28:36,880 --> 01:28:38,320
and I came right over.

1416
01:28:38,320 --> 01:28:39,840
Sorry I didn't get it earlier.

1417
01:28:40,800 --> 01:28:42,440
I turn my phone off at night.

1418
01:28:42,440 --> 01:28:44,360
- That's the thing
with cell phones, Mom,

1419
01:28:44,360 --> 01:28:45,440
is you just leave 'em on.

1420
01:28:46,480 --> 01:28:47,800
Well, nevermind.

1421
01:28:47,800 --> 01:28:49,040
- What's wrong?

1422
01:28:50,560 --> 01:28:53,080
You both look like you didn't
get any sleep last night.

1423
01:28:53,080 --> 01:28:54,360
- Yeah, we didn't.

1424
01:28:54,360 --> 01:28:56,440
Bobby here was
kinda seeing things

1425
01:28:56,440 --> 01:29:00,400
and some Bangladeshi call
center killed my car.

1426
01:29:01,280 --> 01:29:03,240
Just, long night.

1427
01:29:03,240 --> 01:29:04,920
But it seems pretty
far away now.

1428
01:29:04,920 --> 01:29:05,760
- Hmm.

1429
01:29:05,760 --> 01:29:08,200
(chuckles) All right.

1430
01:29:09,080 --> 01:29:10,760
Let's get you both to my house.

1431
01:29:12,200 --> 01:29:13,040
- Where's Gregory?

1432
01:29:13,960 --> 01:29:14,920
- Oh, Gregory's in the car.

1433
01:29:14,920 --> 01:29:16,480
Why don't you go get him?

1434
01:29:16,480 --> 01:29:18,080
- Yeah, I gotta get
to some service.

1435
01:29:18,080 --> 01:29:20,400
I gotta call work and tell
them I'm gonna be late

1436
01:29:20,400 --> 01:29:21,520
and I gotta call the garage.

1437
01:29:21,520 --> 01:29:23,200
- Oh, I called the
garage for you.

1438
01:29:23,200 --> 01:29:24,440
- Okay.

1439
01:29:24,440 --> 01:29:25,800
Well, I'm gonna
head out to the car.

1440
01:29:27,760 --> 01:29:29,840
- All right, well, we're just
gonna take a couple minutes

1441
01:29:29,840 --> 01:29:30,960
to pick up around here.

1442
01:29:32,240 --> 01:29:33,040
- [Andrew] I'll grab
your stuff, Bobby.

1443
01:29:33,040 --> 01:29:34,360
- Oh, thanks.

1444
01:30:11,440 --> 01:30:13,360
(baby cooing)

1445
01:30:13,360 --> 01:30:14,840
Oh no, no, no, no.

1446
01:30:14,840 --> 01:30:15,600
No.

1447
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:17,720
Gregory!

1448
01:30:18,760 --> 01:30:19,480
- Bobby!

1449
01:30:20,960 --> 01:30:24,280
- Gregory!

1450
01:30:24,280 --> 01:30:26,800
(Gregory crying)

1451
01:30:26,800 --> 01:30:28,400
- What the fuck?

1452
01:30:28,400 --> 01:30:29,520
- No, no, no, no.

1453
01:30:29,520 --> 01:30:32,400
- Bobby!

1454
01:30:33,320 --> 01:30:34,080
Hey, Bobby.

1455
01:30:37,320 --> 01:30:38,560
- Keep away from me!

1456
01:30:38,560 --> 01:30:39,480
You!

1457
01:30:39,480 --> 01:30:40,720
She was warning me about you!

1458
01:30:40,720 --> 01:30:42,000
- Hey, you see this, right?

1459
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:43,280
This looks just
like Bridgette's.

1460
01:30:46,080 --> 01:30:48,560
- Yes, I know, I had the
garage guy drop it off

1461
01:30:48,560 --> 01:30:50,040
since he was coming over anyway.

1462
01:30:51,480 --> 01:30:52,760
- What are you talking about?

1463
01:30:54,400 --> 01:30:55,400
Who does that?

1464
01:30:55,400 --> 01:30:56,800
You're...

1465
01:30:56,800 --> 01:30:58,000
You're sick!

1466
01:30:58,000 --> 01:30:59,400
Bobby!

1467
01:30:59,400 --> 01:31:02,760
- He's not going to destroy
two generations of this family.

1468
01:31:02,760 --> 01:31:04,040
- Ma, he wasn't always like--

1469
01:31:04,040 --> 01:31:07,040
- I gave him the shovel,
but he dug the hole.

1470
01:31:07,040 --> 01:31:07,800
And he's right.

1471
01:31:09,680 --> 01:31:11,000
He should've been driving.

1472
01:31:15,120 --> 01:31:15,880
- [Andrew] Bobby?

1473
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:17,720
Bobby!

1474
01:31:18,760 --> 01:31:21,440
