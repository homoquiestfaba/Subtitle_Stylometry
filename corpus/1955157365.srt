1
00:02:09,495 --> 00:02:11,296
I got one of them.

2
00:02:20,705 --> 00:02:22,307
He's on foot.

3
00:02:23,241 --> 00:02:24,743
Heading east toward...

4
00:03:12,824 --> 00:03:14,893
Shut up.

5
00:04:16,322 --> 00:04:17,723
Eric?

6
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:23,563
The power's out.

7
00:04:42,113 --> 00:04:43,415
Eric?

8
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:36,194
You have completed
the testing phase

9
00:06:36,228 --> 00:06:37,562
of your application.

10
00:06:43,201 --> 00:06:45,036
Hey Jared,
take a look at this.

11
00:06:49,507 --> 00:06:51,144
Well, that's never
happened before.

12
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:07,692
25 years ago,

13
00:07:07,725 --> 00:07:10,129
we were faced
with the unimaginable.

14
00:07:16,701 --> 00:07:19,137
And we were left
with nothing.

15
00:07:22,774 --> 00:07:26,946
But from the darkness
came a spark.

16
00:07:26,978 --> 00:07:29,214
And from that spark,
grew the future.

17
00:07:33,151 --> 00:07:34,787
I'm Paul Bateson,

18
00:07:34,819 --> 00:07:38,089
CEO and cofounder
of VOPO Technologies.

19
00:07:38,122 --> 00:07:40,725
As we approach
this upcoming anniversary,

20
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:42,728
let us take time to reflect

21
00:07:42,761 --> 00:07:46,665
on how far we have come
since those darkest of times.

22
00:07:46,697 --> 00:07:48,266
Here at VOPO Technologies,

23
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:51,503
we are honoring the strength
and resilience of Sector Six

24
00:07:51,536 --> 00:07:55,807
by bringing power, comfort
and security to our citizens.

25
00:07:58,644 --> 00:08:01,847
Our journey has been one of
sacrifice and perseverance.

26
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:04,750
But with some old tools
and some new ideas,

27
00:08:04,783 --> 00:08:09,187
VOPO Technologies is
rebuilding our future today.

28
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:16,028
25 years ago,
we were faced...

29
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:18,630
Simon.

30
00:08:18,663 --> 00:08:21,800
Did you lose anything
in the reset?

31
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:23,302
I was pretty young.

32
00:08:23,334 --> 00:08:25,937
I mostly...

33
00:08:25,971 --> 00:08:28,173
I mostly just remember
the gadgets.

34
00:08:28,206 --> 00:08:30,175
Well, I was there.

35
00:08:30,208 --> 00:08:32,677
It proved one thing.

36
00:08:32,711 --> 00:08:37,216
Technology maintains stability.
It's the only thing that can.

37
00:08:37,249 --> 00:08:39,817
What VOPO does, Simon,

38
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:42,687
is keep things constant.

39
00:08:42,721 --> 00:08:45,124
There are individuals
who would like to undermine

40
00:08:45,157 --> 00:08:46,825
that stability.

41
00:08:46,857 --> 00:08:50,328
And that's where you come in.

42
00:08:50,361 --> 00:08:55,100
It's called, "quality control."

43
00:08:55,133 --> 00:08:56,802
We'll be organizing
a candlelight vigil

44
00:08:56,835 --> 00:09:00,940
for the anniversary
of the reset.

45
00:09:00,972 --> 00:09:04,208
There's a sign up sheet
for volunteers.

46
00:09:04,241 --> 00:09:05,843
And...

47
00:09:05,876 --> 00:09:08,046
We could always use
more candles.

48
00:09:09,947 --> 00:09:12,584
And let's not forget
those citizens...

49
00:09:12,618 --> 00:09:15,653
Ahem, who passed
this week.

50
00:09:15,687 --> 00:09:16,822
So what we're gonna do is

51
00:09:16,855 --> 00:09:20,893
we're gonna take
a moment of silence

52
00:09:20,926 --> 00:09:25,965
for those loved ones.

53
00:09:25,998 --> 00:09:28,367
Lisa Hudson.

54
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:31,603
Frank Dobbins.

55
00:09:31,636 --> 00:09:34,205
Eric Ross.

56
00:09:34,239 --> 00:09:38,644
Jetta Hunter.

57
00:09:38,677 --> 00:09:41,747
Marty Jace.

58
00:09:41,779 --> 00:09:43,881
Move all of them.

59
00:09:43,914 --> 00:09:46,050
Metals from here
to there...

60
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:48,620
-Thank you...
-I put in eight, 10, 12 hours.

61
00:09:48,653 --> 00:09:50,022
I'm sitting
in that cab.

62
00:09:50,054 --> 00:09:52,024
I need to tell her,
I'll do anything.

63
00:09:54,759 --> 00:09:56,328
Mrs. Ross?

64
00:09:59,764 --> 00:10:02,134
Simon.

65
00:10:10,741 --> 00:10:13,878
I'm sorry about Eric.

66
00:10:13,912 --> 00:10:16,048
He was a real talented kid.

67
00:10:18,817 --> 00:10:20,852
Radiation in the
outer zone areas

68
00:10:20,885 --> 00:10:22,887
remain at harmful levels.

69
00:10:22,921 --> 00:10:26,025
Outer zone citizens
are urged to remain indoors

70
00:10:26,057 --> 00:10:30,229
and limit outdoor exposure
to only one hour a day.

71
00:10:30,261 --> 00:10:31,429
The current temperature

72
00:10:31,462 --> 00:10:33,432
in the western block of City Six

73
00:10:33,465 --> 00:10:36,201
is 14 degrees celsius.

74
00:11:49,173 --> 00:11:51,375
Pop...

75
00:11:51,408 --> 00:11:54,278
Pop! Wake up.

76
00:11:54,312 --> 00:11:56,447
Pop, wake up.

77
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,516
What time is it?

78
00:11:58,549 --> 00:12:00,451
You got work
in half an hour.

79
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:05,090
Let me fix you
some breakfast.

80
00:12:05,123 --> 00:12:06,892
Tomorrow.

81
00:12:11,395 --> 00:12:12,931
Bye.

82
00:12:37,188 --> 00:12:38,089
Hey.

83
00:12:38,124 --> 00:12:39,858
How much could I get
for all this Tetris?

84
00:12:45,096 --> 00:12:46,499
Hey!

85
00:12:49,533 --> 00:12:51,537
Ed.

86
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:53,839
Yeah.

87
00:12:53,871 --> 00:12:55,507
He wants to sell his Tetris.

88
00:13:03,414 --> 00:13:04,582
I'll give ya...

89
00:13:04,615 --> 00:13:07,251
20 bit.

90
00:13:07,284 --> 00:13:09,355
If it works.

91
00:13:12,591 --> 00:13:14,259
Whatever, man.

92
00:13:47,658 --> 00:13:52,431
You were at Eric's service.

93
00:13:52,464 --> 00:13:54,132
What's your name?

94
00:13:58,003 --> 00:13:59,538
I'm Simon.

95
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:07,545
Pretty rare stuff.

96
00:14:11,615 --> 00:14:14,385
A lot for that stuff.

97
00:14:14,418 --> 00:14:16,187
Where'd you find it?

98
00:14:20,392 --> 00:14:23,362
Why, so your boss
can cut me out?

99
00:14:25,629 --> 00:14:29,668
Good.

100
00:14:29,701 --> 00:14:30,668
You know...

101
00:14:32,269 --> 00:14:35,439
If you ever need any help
around here, real help,

102
00:14:35,472 --> 00:14:38,409
this is kind of my thing.

103
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:43,182
Yeah, sorry.

104
00:14:48,219 --> 00:14:51,323
What did you say
your name was?

105
00:15:02,133 --> 00:15:05,371
Do you remember
when I took you camping?

106
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:35,132
We're lucky.

107
00:15:35,166 --> 00:15:37,703
All those kids that were
born after the reset.

108
00:15:37,735 --> 00:15:40,371
They will never see stars.

109
00:17:24,174 --> 00:17:27,445
Cruiser
requested pick up at squad two.

110
00:17:27,479 --> 00:17:29,280
Copy that.

111
00:21:38,863 --> 00:21:40,798
Nightly status report.

112
00:21:40,832 --> 00:21:42,801
City six citizens
are reminded

113
00:21:42,834 --> 00:21:46,837
to please refrain from burning
any and all waste or refuse.

114
00:21:46,871 --> 00:21:50,542
Scheduled waste pickups
will resume again shortly.

115
00:21:50,575 --> 00:21:51,710
Representative...

116
00:22:27,444 --> 00:22:30,013
Just one second,
I'm in the bathroom.

117
00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:35,586
All right.

118
00:22:46,663 --> 00:22:49,634
We had some incidents
the past few nights.

119
00:22:49,666 --> 00:22:52,403
In the complex
and surrounding area.

120
00:22:52,436 --> 00:22:55,873
Have you seen
or heard anything?

121
00:22:55,906 --> 00:23:00,010
No. I just play games
on my computer all night.

122
00:23:00,044 --> 00:23:01,947
I'm a night person myself.

123
00:23:10,221 --> 00:23:13,057
I ask because some
of the neighbors

124
00:23:13,089 --> 00:23:16,059
reported seeing someone.

125
00:23:16,093 --> 00:23:18,028
It was past curfew.

126
00:23:18,061 --> 00:23:21,064
And this person
was trying to break in...

127
00:23:21,097 --> 00:23:24,668
To this apartment.

128
00:23:24,701 --> 00:23:28,105
Like I said, I just play
computer games all night.

129
00:23:30,842 --> 00:23:33,545
If you want you could
talk to the city,

130
00:23:33,577 --> 00:23:35,846
and they can check
the log on my racor.

131
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,449
Okay.

132
00:23:37,481 --> 00:23:38,849
Thanks.

133
00:23:43,988 --> 00:23:46,725
Keep an eye out
for anything, okay?

134
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:10,548
Hey. Did you hear
anybody out here

135
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:11,916
the last couple nights?

136
00:24:17,654 --> 00:24:20,157
This came for you,
but you were gone.

137
00:24:23,027 --> 00:24:25,864
She just has a fever.

138
00:24:25,896 --> 00:24:28,566
I'll see if I can
find her something.

139
00:24:30,667 --> 00:24:32,736
Does anybody else
know about this?

140
00:26:16,173 --> 00:26:20,111
Hey. Simon, right?

141
00:26:20,144 --> 00:26:22,046
Remember me?

142
00:26:22,078 --> 00:26:23,981
I'm Max.

143
00:26:25,383 --> 00:26:27,352
This came with a drive.

144
00:26:27,384 --> 00:26:28,819
Ahem, and I can't
get into it,

145
00:26:28,853 --> 00:26:31,890
and I was thinking
that maybe you could.

146
00:26:38,929 --> 00:26:41,800
Maybe.

147
00:26:46,903 --> 00:26:49,307
How's the Tetris business
doing?

148
00:26:49,339 --> 00:26:50,875
I'm leaving it.

149
00:26:50,907 --> 00:26:53,243
Really? Where you going?

150
00:26:53,277 --> 00:26:55,813
Vopo.

151
00:26:55,846 --> 00:26:59,784
Working for
the bad guys?

152
00:27:13,163 --> 00:27:16,033
Sorry, it's not
the Ritz-Carlton.

153
00:27:20,336 --> 00:27:21,806
What's that?

154
00:27:21,838 --> 00:27:26,810
It's like a fancy place
for rich people.

155
00:27:28,311 --> 00:27:30,848
Little sandwiches.

156
00:27:41,925 --> 00:27:44,461
Got a problem
with success?

157
00:27:44,494 --> 00:27:48,832
No. Just people.

158
00:27:48,865 --> 00:27:51,836
I'd like to stay
in a place like that.

159
00:27:53,471 --> 00:27:55,740
You would have
fit in back then.

160
00:27:58,008 --> 00:28:01,211
I wouldn't know.

161
00:28:01,244 --> 00:28:03,914
Well, you know,
you look just like the people

162
00:28:03,948 --> 00:28:05,316
from the old magazines.

163
00:28:05,348 --> 00:28:06,416
Yeah?

164
00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:08,219
How do they look?

165
00:28:08,251 --> 00:28:10,055
Like they drink milk.

166
00:28:13,390 --> 00:28:16,494
I've had milk.

167
00:28:16,527 --> 00:28:18,763
You haven't.

168
00:28:18,796 --> 00:28:21,231
Real milk
cost 1,000 bit.

169
00:28:22,532 --> 00:28:24,836
Well, I guess
that's a good reason

170
00:28:24,868 --> 00:28:26,103
to be successful.

171
00:28:26,136 --> 00:28:29,139
You get to try things
other people don't.

172
00:28:44,054 --> 00:28:46,490
You built all this?

173
00:28:46,523 --> 00:28:47,791
Yeah.

174
00:28:47,825 --> 00:28:50,862
And it's all Tetris?

175
00:28:50,894 --> 00:28:52,997
All of it.

176
00:29:33,971 --> 00:29:37,340
No fucking way.

177
00:29:37,374 --> 00:29:39,210
How did you do that?

178
00:29:42,313 --> 00:29:45,449
I don't know what
to tell you, man.

179
00:29:49,353 --> 00:29:52,090
That's Eric.

180
00:30:08,239 --> 00:30:10,240
To connect your call,

181
00:30:10,273 --> 00:30:12,609
please enter your
citizen ID number.

182
00:30:30,961 --> 00:30:32,997
Are you going to see Abbey?

183
00:31:30,554 --> 00:31:33,291
Where is this?

184
00:31:33,324 --> 00:31:36,060
It's the desert,
just past the outer zone.

185
00:31:42,031 --> 00:31:45,368
Do you know other people
who've been out there?

186
00:31:45,402 --> 00:31:47,004
No.

187
00:31:47,037 --> 00:31:50,341
You hear stories of people
going out there

188
00:31:50,374 --> 00:31:54,444
and they don't come back,
that kind of thing.

189
00:31:54,478 --> 00:31:57,548
I didn't think
he had it in him.

190
00:32:02,353 --> 00:32:07,291
Why do you think your name
is on that drive?

191
00:32:07,324 --> 00:32:10,161
Maybe he didn't think
you could crack it.

192
00:32:15,365 --> 00:32:17,602
You're looking
at the wrong place.

193
00:32:20,037 --> 00:32:22,405
There. Look at that.

194
00:32:26,042 --> 00:32:28,078
Again.

195
00:32:34,317 --> 00:32:37,355
Again.

196
00:32:43,126 --> 00:32:45,028
All right.

197
00:32:45,061 --> 00:32:47,063
Get out.

198
00:32:47,096 --> 00:32:48,331
What?

199
00:32:48,365 --> 00:32:52,537
Get the fuck out
of my apartment!

200
00:33:24,468 --> 00:33:27,805
You have entered the
City Six citizen database.

201
00:33:27,837 --> 00:33:32,076
For information, people enter the
citizen's identification number.

202
00:33:36,646 --> 00:33:38,448
Cynthia Greyerson.

203
00:33:38,481 --> 00:33:40,550
Outer Zone 9...

204
00:33:40,584 --> 00:33:43,220
So we're gonna try to finish
this project by this Tuesday,

205
00:33:43,252 --> 00:33:44,754
and I'm gonna need
someone to go

206
00:33:44,788 --> 00:33:46,123
in the archival file system

207
00:33:46,155 --> 00:33:48,091
and take a look
at the kernel module

208
00:33:48,125 --> 00:33:50,795
because after it's been running for a
little while, it stops firing d.C.N's.

209
00:34:17,121 --> 00:34:20,324
This concludes
the nightly status report.

210
00:34:20,356 --> 00:34:23,661
The outside threat level
remains low.

211
00:34:41,677 --> 00:34:46,116
You like it or not,
I'm part of this.

212
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:48,485
And I'm useful.

213
00:35:09,873 --> 00:35:11,708
We'll leave in the morning.

214
00:35:11,742 --> 00:35:14,678
The air quality index
is dangerously high

215
00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:16,312
in quadrant one.

216
00:35:16,346 --> 00:35:18,782
Residents are advised
to carry particle respirators

217
00:35:18,815 --> 00:35:21,184
at all times.

218
00:35:21,217 --> 00:35:23,219
The current temperature
in City Six

219
00:35:23,253 --> 00:35:26,524
is 14 degrees celsius.

220
00:35:26,556 --> 00:35:29,492
A new and improved
City Six water treatment plant

221
00:35:29,525 --> 00:35:31,561
will finish
construction shortly.

222
00:35:31,594 --> 00:35:33,663
Bringing clean and potable water

223
00:35:33,697 --> 00:35:36,166
to all citizens.

224
00:35:36,199 --> 00:35:41,372
The City Six suicide index
has decreased 15% this quarter.

225
00:35:41,405 --> 00:35:42,773
City officials attribute this

226
00:35:42,806 --> 00:35:46,610
to newly implemented
treatments for p.R.S.D.

227
00:35:46,643 --> 00:35:49,313
Please inquire within a
City Six medical clinic

228
00:35:49,346 --> 00:35:51,581
to obtain a mood stabilizer
to treat...

229
00:36:06,496 --> 00:36:08,599
Warning. City Six alert.

230
00:36:08,632 --> 00:36:12,570
Outside threat level has
been elevated to critical.

231
00:36:12,603 --> 00:36:13,871
Good night.

232
00:36:26,983 --> 00:36:28,318
If you get tired,
just let me know,

233
00:36:28,351 --> 00:36:30,453
I can take over whenever.

234
00:36:30,487 --> 00:36:32,623
I think I'll be all right.

235
00:36:46,503 --> 00:36:48,439
You see that, right?

236
00:36:53,577 --> 00:36:55,646
What?

237
00:36:55,679 --> 00:36:57,514
That black dot.

238
00:37:02,918 --> 00:37:04,821
I see them all the time.

239
00:37:09,025 --> 00:37:11,894
They're up there, man.

240
00:37:11,927 --> 00:37:13,998
They're watching us.

241
00:37:19,335 --> 00:37:20,770
So...

242
00:37:20,804 --> 00:37:22,905
Who's this lady?

243
00:37:22,938 --> 00:37:25,910
I don't know, but Eric
wants us to find her.

244
00:37:51,101 --> 00:37:53,003
Identification, please.

245
00:38:03,112 --> 00:38:05,348
You two are pretty far out here.

246
00:38:05,382 --> 00:38:07,017
Yeah, my grandmother
lives out here.

247
00:38:07,050 --> 00:38:09,887
You know, she didn't want
to relocate to City Six so...

248
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,556
So I figured I'd visit.

249
00:38:12,588 --> 00:38:14,724
Adhere to curfew and stay away
from the outliers.

250
00:38:14,757 --> 00:38:16,726
Absolutely.

251
00:38:56,565 --> 00:38:58,868
Hello ma'am, how are you
doing this morning?

252
00:38:58,902 --> 00:39:01,672
Protection mandate 512
states that all inhabitants

253
00:39:01,704 --> 00:39:03,606
of the outer zone perimeter
are flagged citizens

254
00:39:03,639 --> 00:39:07,610
and subject to Sector Six
security protocols.

255
00:39:07,643 --> 00:39:09,379
We're at a severe
threat level and just

256
00:39:09,413 --> 00:39:10,681
with the rolling blackouts,

257
00:39:10,713 --> 00:39:13,049
we just need to make
a couple repairs.

258
00:39:33,003 --> 00:39:35,573
We'll try not to
take too much of your time.

259
00:39:46,583 --> 00:39:49,153
You live here by yourself?

260
00:39:49,186 --> 00:39:51,121
Just me.

261
00:39:51,153 --> 00:39:52,956
My son lives here sometimes.

262
00:39:55,592 --> 00:39:56,760
That's nice.

263
00:39:56,793 --> 00:39:58,628
I got a couple kids myself.

264
00:39:58,661 --> 00:40:01,664
Happy accidents, right?

265
00:40:01,697 --> 00:40:03,666
Every day is...
What do they say?

266
00:40:03,699 --> 00:40:05,835
It's all joy and no fun, right?

267
00:40:12,842 --> 00:40:16,078
These old houses...

268
00:40:16,112 --> 00:40:17,947
My house is the same way.

269
00:40:17,981 --> 00:40:19,550
The wind blows too much.

270
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:22,820
The screen doors
are banging closed.

271
00:40:24,588 --> 00:40:27,925
You expecting your son
back sometime soon?

272
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:33,596
Does he work
out in the city?

273
00:41:02,791 --> 00:41:04,060
Good afternoon, ma'am.

274
00:41:04,094 --> 00:41:06,864
Is this the address
for Stephen greyerson?

275
00:41:06,896 --> 00:41:09,132
He's my son.

276
00:41:09,164 --> 00:41:10,967
Has your son
ever mentioned anyone

277
00:41:11,001 --> 00:41:14,872
by the name of Laura gates,
Abbey weber or Eric Ross?

278
00:41:14,905 --> 00:41:17,240
Do any of those names
sound familiar?

279
00:41:17,273 --> 00:41:19,576
Where is he?

280
00:41:19,608 --> 00:41:22,144
The bodies of Stephen
and an unidentified female

281
00:41:22,177 --> 00:41:24,748
were discovered the other day.

282
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:27,083
What happened?

283
00:41:27,117 --> 00:41:28,885
Ma'am, I'm
going to have to confiscate

284
00:41:28,918 --> 00:41:31,654
all of Stephen's computers
and hard drives.

285
00:41:32,889 --> 00:41:35,159
Thank you, ma'am.
We're all finished up.

286
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:39,830
Just be cool.

287
00:42:09,893 --> 00:42:12,795
You know, I read about
places like this.

288
00:44:02,938 --> 00:44:07,344
Okay, take it easy.
Okay, deep breaths.

289
00:44:14,117 --> 00:44:15,819
Mercy medical.

290
00:44:17,487 --> 00:44:20,423
Hello?

291
00:44:37,239 --> 00:44:39,375
Got suspicious activity
in quad two.

292
00:44:39,409 --> 00:44:40,376
Requesting service...

293
00:44:46,282 --> 00:44:48,885
It's just up here.

294
00:44:48,918 --> 00:44:51,021
To the left.

295
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:34,764
This is your
City Six nightly status report.

296
00:45:34,797 --> 00:45:36,398
City six citizens
are reminded

297
00:45:36,431 --> 00:45:40,936
to please refrain from burning
any and all waste or refuse.

298
00:45:40,969 --> 00:45:44,206
Scheduled waste pickups
will resume again shortly.

299
00:45:44,239 --> 00:45:47,343
Representatives from VOPO
technologies have announced

300
00:45:47,376 --> 00:45:51,947
that a fallen branch caused a massive
power outage in the eastern block.

301
00:45:51,981 --> 00:45:54,918
The outage was not a result
of criminal mischief.

302
00:45:54,951 --> 00:45:57,454
And its proximity
to the upcoming anniversary

303
00:45:57,487 --> 00:46:00,023
is purely
coincidental.

304
00:46:00,056 --> 00:46:01,291
The air quality index

305
00:46:01,324 --> 00:46:04,126
is dangerously high
in quadrant one.

306
00:46:04,159 --> 00:46:06,862
Residents are advised
to carry particle respirators

307
00:46:06,896 --> 00:46:09,399
at all times.

308
00:46:09,431 --> 00:46:10,833
Tonight's status report

309
00:46:10,867 --> 00:46:13,503
includes a message
from VOPO Technologies.

310
00:46:13,536 --> 00:46:16,572
I'm Paul
bateson, ceo and cofounder...

311
00:47:41,190 --> 00:47:43,226
Got to pay the
telephone, please.

312
00:47:43,259 --> 00:47:45,561
Got to pay the
telephone, please.

313
00:47:53,402 --> 00:47:55,237
Our friend Stephen is missing.

314
00:47:55,271 --> 00:47:57,274
And we found
this stuff at his house

315
00:47:57,306 --> 00:48:00,309
and we were wondering
if you know anything.

316
00:48:03,980 --> 00:48:08,385
Yeah. I called
looking for my sister...

317
00:48:08,418 --> 00:48:10,519
Abbey.

318
00:48:10,552 --> 00:48:12,688
She's Stephen's girlfriend.

319
00:48:12,722 --> 00:48:16,626
The two of them
are always together.

320
00:48:16,659 --> 00:48:19,061
Have you seen her?

321
00:48:19,996 --> 00:48:22,331
No.

322
00:48:29,605 --> 00:48:32,074
What?

323
00:48:32,108 --> 00:48:34,311
I had a patient yesterday

324
00:48:34,344 --> 00:48:37,280
who kept going on
about the desert.

325
00:48:43,585 --> 00:48:45,454
Wait, I know where this is.

326
00:48:48,490 --> 00:48:51,427
How do you know
about this place, Grace?

327
00:48:51,460 --> 00:48:54,163
My sister. She and
Stephen met there

328
00:48:54,197 --> 00:48:56,333
for a lights out party.

329
00:48:56,365 --> 00:48:58,300
What's that?

330
00:48:58,333 --> 00:49:01,203
It's a reset anniversary party.

331
00:49:03,172 --> 00:49:06,009
Do you go to those, Grace?

332
00:49:06,041 --> 00:49:07,143
No.

333
00:49:41,510 --> 00:49:43,413
Hello?

334
00:49:54,222 --> 00:49:55,625
I'm looking for my sister.

335
00:49:57,626 --> 00:49:59,528
Her name is Abbey
and she used to live here.

336
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:06,303
I just want to know
if you've seen her.

337
00:50:07,804 --> 00:50:10,539
Abbey?

338
00:50:10,572 --> 00:50:13,309
I hope she made it.

339
00:50:17,447 --> 00:50:19,282
Made it where?

340
00:50:19,315 --> 00:50:21,684
Hey! Made it where?

341
00:50:23,219 --> 00:50:24,454
Look at me.

342
00:50:24,487 --> 00:50:27,090
Look at me.
What are you talking about?

343
00:50:27,123 --> 00:50:29,224
- Made it where?
- It's time to go.

344
00:50:29,257 --> 00:50:30,460
Max...

345
00:50:30,492 --> 00:50:33,462
Made it where?

346
00:50:33,496 --> 00:50:37,166
Made it where? What
are you talking about?

347
00:50:37,199 --> 00:50:41,136
What the fuck were you
doing in my apartment?

348
00:50:41,170 --> 00:50:43,572
We're all gonna
die in here.

349
00:51:12,902 --> 00:51:14,804
Come on!

350
00:51:33,289 --> 00:51:34,491
What are you doing?

351
00:51:34,523 --> 00:51:36,692
Just put your head down.

352
00:51:39,362 --> 00:51:40,864
What is all this stuff?

353
00:51:40,896 --> 00:51:43,432
Shut the fuck up.

354
00:52:15,831 --> 00:52:17,733
I live two blocks away.

355
00:52:24,472 --> 00:52:26,643
Was that the girl
from your apartment?

356
00:52:26,675 --> 00:52:28,510
Yeah, the one
from the video.

357
00:52:28,543 --> 00:52:31,547
What was she talking about?

358
00:52:31,581 --> 00:52:33,449
I don't know,
junkie babble.

359
00:52:33,481 --> 00:52:35,552
Should know all about it.

360
00:52:35,585 --> 00:52:38,855
What the fuck are
they talking about?

361
00:52:56,838 --> 00:53:00,809
So... what's the deal?

362
00:53:00,842 --> 00:53:02,645
With what?

363
00:53:04,447 --> 00:53:08,718
You two seem
like an unlikely pair.

364
00:53:08,751 --> 00:53:10,854
How did you meet?

365
00:53:20,795 --> 00:53:23,298
Through mutual friends.

366
00:53:23,331 --> 00:53:25,601
Stephen?

367
00:53:25,635 --> 00:53:28,638
No. His name was Eric.

368
00:53:30,405 --> 00:53:32,775
Eric, that's a good name.

369
00:53:35,344 --> 00:53:37,646
He was my best friend.

370
00:53:39,715 --> 00:53:43,452
But he got...

371
00:53:43,485 --> 00:53:45,922
He got locked up
for computer fraud.

372
00:53:50,393 --> 00:53:52,427
Started hanging out
with a different crowd,

373
00:53:52,460 --> 00:53:53,963
I didn't really see him
much after that.

374
00:53:57,400 --> 00:54:01,704
I met Eric when I was 17
at a youth reform center.

375
00:54:03,838 --> 00:54:07,744
Before I met him, I was just
stealing computer parts.

376
00:54:07,777 --> 00:54:10,447
He showed me what
you can do with them.

377
00:54:12,681 --> 00:54:14,817
He seems like a good friend.

378
00:54:19,088 --> 00:54:21,423
When did you see him last?

379
00:54:22,724 --> 00:54:24,960
We were doing a night run...

380
00:54:24,994 --> 00:54:28,331
Security guard showed up.

381
00:54:28,364 --> 00:54:30,632
I got away.

382
00:54:30,666 --> 00:54:32,568
He didn't.

383
00:54:40,643 --> 00:54:43,480
He's dead.
In case you're wondering.

384
00:54:57,492 --> 00:54:59,929
Do you wanna listen
to some music?

385
00:55:02,931 --> 00:55:06,001
Max has music.

386
00:55:06,034 --> 00:55:07,703
Okay, great.

387
00:55:07,737 --> 00:55:10,405
Let's hear it.

388
00:55:10,438 --> 00:55:12,875
I don't listen to music.

389
00:55:12,907 --> 00:55:14,710
Yes, you do.

390
00:55:14,744 --> 00:55:19,615
I've seen you with
a tape player.

391
00:55:19,648 --> 00:55:21,617
The thing about Max...

392
00:55:21,650 --> 00:55:26,456
Is he wants everybody
to think he's a tough guy.

393
00:55:27,789 --> 00:55:30,726
Okay.

394
00:55:32,795 --> 00:55:34,364
You don't know what I think.

395
00:55:34,396 --> 00:55:37,733
Okay.

396
00:55:37,766 --> 00:55:39,802
Whatever.

397
00:55:56,485 --> 00:55:58,655
Max?

398
00:56:07,963 --> 00:56:11,634
You're receiving a call
from e.C.M. Penitentiary.

399
00:56:11,666 --> 00:56:13,769
This call may be recorded
for judicial purposes.

400
00:56:14,603 --> 00:56:16,571
Hey, Travis.

401
00:56:16,605 --> 00:56:19,509
This is the third
time this month.

402
00:56:19,541 --> 00:56:22,511
You know I don't get
many phone calls here.

403
00:56:22,545 --> 00:56:24,914
Hey, Maxy.

404
00:56:24,947 --> 00:56:27,016
Can you hear me?

405
00:56:27,048 --> 00:56:28,550
Are you being a big boy?

406
00:56:28,583 --> 00:56:31,186
You taking care of your
little sister for me?

407
00:56:31,219 --> 00:56:32,988
Love you both so very much.

408
00:56:33,021 --> 00:56:34,423
And...

409
00:56:34,456 --> 00:56:36,958
I'll be home so soon,
I promise.

410
00:56:36,992 --> 00:56:39,829
Travis, I'm gonna
call back later this week

411
00:56:39,862 --> 00:56:42,064
so can you please
try to be home.

412
00:56:49,003 --> 00:56:52,775
That's my mom.

413
00:56:52,807 --> 00:56:54,643
She...

414
00:56:54,677 --> 00:56:57,981
Got 25 years up at e.C.M.
For drug trafficking.

415
00:56:59,949 --> 00:57:02,617
When the power went out
and everything went dark,

416
00:57:02,650 --> 00:57:04,753
everyone started
freaking out, you know.

417
00:57:04,786 --> 00:57:06,855
Nobody's going to work.

418
00:57:06,889 --> 00:57:08,891
All the prison guards,
they got families,

419
00:57:08,923 --> 00:57:12,961
you know, so...
They just left.

420
00:57:14,496 --> 00:57:15,831
I don't really...
I don't...

421
00:57:15,864 --> 00:57:17,766
I don't like to think about...

422
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:20,970
How they lasted
as long as they did but...

423
00:57:27,775 --> 00:57:30,946
Eventually everyone died.

424
00:57:33,748 --> 00:57:36,251
Not knowing why...

425
00:57:36,284 --> 00:57:38,922
They were abandoned.

426
00:57:59,007 --> 00:58:01,643
This is terrible.

427
00:58:37,713 --> 00:58:39,682
What's your story?

428
00:58:42,751 --> 00:58:45,721
What do you mean?

429
00:58:45,753 --> 00:58:48,290
I don't know.

430
00:58:48,324 --> 00:58:50,092
I'm not from around here.

431
00:59:34,936 --> 00:59:37,940
Grace...

432
00:59:37,972 --> 00:59:40,742
I have to tell you something.

433
00:59:45,213 --> 00:59:48,183
Stephen's dead.

434
01:02:01,817 --> 01:02:03,885
I feel like shit.

435
01:02:06,155 --> 01:02:09,892
Don't look so happy
with yourself.

436
01:02:09,925 --> 01:02:12,928
I didn't do anything.

437
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:15,263
Just quit it.

438
01:02:20,501 --> 01:02:24,172
I don't think I'm gonna
drink that stuff again.

439
01:02:27,108 --> 01:02:28,844
Well, to be honest,
I think she...

440
01:02:28,876 --> 01:02:31,146
Where you... Simon.

441
01:02:31,179 --> 01:02:33,248
What the fuck?

442
01:02:46,527 --> 01:02:49,063
We gotta get outta here.

443
01:02:49,097 --> 01:02:51,300
Gotta get outta here.

444
01:02:51,333 --> 01:02:52,934
We gotta get out.

445
01:03:57,666 --> 01:04:00,303
Sorry it's taken me
so long to get over here.

446
01:04:01,570 --> 01:04:03,338
What, were you busy?

447
01:04:05,106 --> 01:04:07,275
Yeah, I got a really good job.

448
01:04:14,081 --> 01:04:17,652
Mrs. Ross, I...

449
01:04:17,686 --> 01:04:19,454
If you need anything,

450
01:04:19,487 --> 01:04:22,390
at all...

451
01:04:22,423 --> 01:04:24,527
Money's not an issue.

452
01:04:37,306 --> 01:04:39,307
I'm sorry.

453
01:05:42,403 --> 01:05:46,742
This is your City Six
nightly status report.

454
01:05:46,775 --> 01:05:50,546
The area quality index is
dangerously high in quadrant one.

455
01:05:50,579 --> 01:05:56,285
Residents are advised to carry
particle respirators at all times.

456
01:05:56,318 --> 01:06:00,521
Radiation in the outer zone
areas remain at harmful levels.

457
01:06:00,554 --> 01:06:03,692
Outer zone citizens
are urged to remain indoors

458
01:06:03,724 --> 01:06:08,496
and limit outdoor exposure
to only one hour a day.

459
01:06:08,530 --> 01:06:11,133
Representatives from
VOPO Technologies

460
01:06:11,166 --> 01:06:13,202
have announced
that a fallen branch...

461
01:06:21,643 --> 01:06:23,679
Try that.

462
01:06:27,481 --> 01:06:31,186
I see a lot of myself
in you, Simon.

463
01:06:32,554 --> 01:06:34,356
What do you mean?

464
01:06:34,389 --> 01:06:39,428
Facing the future and not knowing
what it has in store for you.

465
01:06:39,460 --> 01:06:42,630
When I was your age,
I knew a fellow named tom.

466
01:06:42,664 --> 01:06:44,800
Terrific guy.

467
01:06:44,833 --> 01:06:46,769
He could do anything
with a computer.

468
01:06:46,802 --> 01:06:48,202
He could rig anything.

469
01:06:48,235 --> 01:06:50,271
Break into networks.

470
01:06:50,304 --> 01:06:52,507
Shut anything down
with a click of a button.

471
01:06:53,608 --> 01:06:56,144
He was my best friend.

472
01:06:56,177 --> 01:06:58,413
We started VOPO together.

473
01:06:58,447 --> 01:07:01,282
Back then, it was actually
an interactive media company.

474
01:07:01,315 --> 01:07:05,686
Everything we made
was for personal distraction.

475
01:07:05,719 --> 01:07:09,190
But the company
was struggling.

476
01:07:09,224 --> 01:07:11,559
Vopo was facing
certain bankruptcy

477
01:07:11,592 --> 01:07:13,828
and complete failure.

478
01:07:13,862 --> 01:07:15,431
What did you do?

479
01:07:15,463 --> 01:07:17,565
We went to a city
in the desert.

480
01:07:17,599 --> 01:07:18,734
Far away from here.

481
01:07:20,202 --> 01:07:23,338
It was a terrible place
for a city.

482
01:07:23,371 --> 01:07:26,307
I bet there's nothing there now.

483
01:07:26,340 --> 01:07:29,177
But it was a place
you could make a lot of money.

484
01:07:29,210 --> 01:07:30,745
If you were lucky.

485
01:07:33,614 --> 01:07:37,251
We took the last of VOPO's
venture capital

486
01:07:37,284 --> 01:07:39,487
and we placed a bet.

487
01:07:41,456 --> 01:07:43,826
We won more money
than you can imagine.

488
01:07:43,858 --> 01:07:47,862
And saved the company.

489
01:07:47,896 --> 01:07:50,266
That was the best time
of my life.

490
01:07:54,202 --> 01:07:56,505
What happened to tom?

491
01:08:27,801 --> 01:08:29,804
It's not much.

492
01:08:39,213 --> 01:08:41,350
Take care
of yourself, sis.

493
01:08:42,817 --> 01:08:45,320
Thanks, Max.

494
01:12:06,453 --> 01:12:08,489
Nicely done, boys.

495
01:12:09,623 --> 01:12:12,360
No, no way.

496
01:12:12,394 --> 01:12:15,864
I've never seen him
like that before.

497
01:12:15,896 --> 01:12:17,131
You want a cocktail?

498
01:12:17,164 --> 01:12:19,068
Sure.

499
01:12:55,136 --> 01:12:57,539
Who is that?

500
01:12:57,572 --> 01:13:00,042
That's Laura Gates.
She used to work here.

501
01:13:01,810 --> 01:13:03,779
She used to have your job.

502
01:13:42,115 --> 01:13:45,953
We led them right to her.

503
01:13:51,259 --> 01:13:54,229
Are you all right?

504
01:14:31,832 --> 01:14:34,969
My name is tom.

505
01:14:35,002 --> 01:14:37,738
You don't know me, but I
helped build the company

506
01:14:37,771 --> 01:14:40,509
that built your city.

507
01:14:40,542 --> 01:14:42,744
Hung the wires that
power your homes.

508
01:14:42,777 --> 01:14:46,047
I built the system
meant to protect you.

509
01:14:47,916 --> 01:14:50,118
I was wrong.

510
01:14:50,150 --> 01:14:52,753
We were all wrong.

511
01:14:52,787 --> 01:14:56,891
I'm broadcasting this
from a remote location

512
01:14:56,925 --> 01:14:59,895
outside the reach
of your civilization.

513
01:15:01,962 --> 01:15:06,768
There is more in this world
than what's in City Six.

514
01:15:07,935 --> 01:15:11,305
There has to be.

515
01:15:11,338 --> 01:15:15,811
If you can find me,
then we can find it together.

516
01:15:17,845 --> 01:15:19,614
Good luck, cowboys.

517
01:15:19,646 --> 01:15:21,048
Good luck, cowboys.

518
01:15:54,181 --> 01:15:56,184
That's tom.

519
01:15:59,621 --> 01:16:02,824
The problem with tom was...

520
01:16:02,856 --> 01:16:04,592
He was like Eric.

521
01:16:04,626 --> 01:16:07,295
Or your friend Max.

522
01:16:07,328 --> 01:16:09,764
We're builders, Simon.

523
01:16:09,796 --> 01:16:12,033
Those guys only destroy.

524
01:16:13,935 --> 01:16:16,304
Simon, what do you think
is out there?

525
01:16:16,337 --> 01:16:17,706
I don't know.

526
01:16:17,738 --> 01:16:19,940
That's right,
you don't have any idea

527
01:16:19,974 --> 01:16:22,243
about the world around you.

528
01:16:22,275 --> 01:16:24,712
This continent is massive.

529
01:16:24,746 --> 01:16:27,148
What do you think's out there?
Take a guess.

530
01:16:27,180 --> 01:16:28,682
Other people.

531
01:16:28,716 --> 01:16:29,851
Other cities.

532
01:16:29,884 --> 01:16:31,886
There are no other cities.

533
01:16:31,918 --> 01:16:34,756
If there were a better city,
I would be there.

534
01:16:35,823 --> 01:16:36,925
What do you think would happen

535
01:16:36,957 --> 01:16:38,192
if someone from Sector Six

536
01:16:38,225 --> 01:16:40,862
made contact with
whoever's out there?

537
01:16:40,895 --> 01:16:43,264
If your friend Max
got through the firewall

538
01:16:43,296 --> 01:16:46,867
and told those people
that we had electricity,

539
01:16:46,900 --> 01:16:49,770
grocery stores, running cars.

540
01:16:49,804 --> 01:16:51,773
They would come
and take it away.

541
01:16:51,805 --> 01:16:53,407
They would take everything.

542
01:16:53,440 --> 01:16:55,978
And leave us dead in the dust.

543
01:17:00,081 --> 01:17:04,752
I know what happened
with you and Eric.

544
01:17:04,786 --> 01:17:07,154
That's why I hired you.

545
01:17:09,189 --> 01:17:12,193
We all have to make
hard choices to survive.

546
01:17:13,728 --> 01:17:16,364
You of all people
should know what.

547
01:18:41,015 --> 01:18:43,251
What are you doing, Max?

548
01:18:57,998 --> 01:19:00,434
Everything all right
in there, Simon?

549
01:19:15,917 --> 01:19:20,421
Attention,
this is a special City Six alert.

550
01:19:20,453 --> 01:19:23,490
Due to worsening conditions,
the outside threat level

551
01:19:23,524 --> 01:19:25,527
has been elevated to imminent.

552
01:19:25,560 --> 01:19:27,061
All outer zone citizens

553
01:19:27,094 --> 01:19:30,498
will be required to
relocate immediately.

554
01:19:30,530 --> 01:19:33,033
Temporary residences
will be provided

555
01:19:33,067 --> 01:19:35,502
in the Southern
block of City Six.

556
01:19:35,536 --> 01:19:37,404
Have a good night.

557
01:19:53,253 --> 01:19:55,222
You're getting pretty
good at that.

558
01:20:53,447 --> 01:20:55,617
And the target is in position.

559
01:21:13,134 --> 01:21:15,536
I'm in.

560
01:21:15,569 --> 01:21:18,006
Confirm status.

561
01:21:18,038 --> 01:21:19,039
I do not have a visual.

562
01:21:19,073 --> 01:21:20,041
Repeat, I do not have a vis...

563
01:21:21,509 --> 01:21:24,177
System compromised.
Attention. System compromised.

564
01:21:24,211 --> 01:21:26,414
Target's whereabouts
are unknown.

565
01:21:35,456 --> 01:21:39,594
What do you see?

566
01:21:41,494 --> 01:21:42,462
Talk to me!

567
01:21:42,496 --> 01:21:43,530
Shit.

568
01:21:45,265 --> 01:21:47,501
No no no no, we've lost visuals.
All down, there...

569
01:22:33,079 --> 01:22:36,484
Max!

570
01:22:36,516 --> 01:22:38,420
I need you to drive.

571
01:22:40,520 --> 01:22:42,256
Drive!

572
01:22:52,666 --> 01:22:55,570
What's that sound?

573
01:22:55,603 --> 01:22:56,738
It's a countdown.

574
01:22:56,770 --> 01:22:59,306
For what?

575
01:22:59,340 --> 01:23:01,609
Until the network
comes back on.

576
01:23:13,154 --> 01:23:14,756
So how'd you do it?

577
01:23:17,224 --> 01:23:19,561
I don't know
what to tell you, man.

578
01:23:27,568 --> 01:23:29,738
Put this on.

579
01:23:55,362 --> 01:23:57,065
Is he doing all right?

580
01:23:57,097 --> 01:23:58,432
Yeah, he's fine.
He just...

581
01:23:58,466 --> 01:24:01,369
He forgot to put iodine
in his water.

582
01:24:07,108 --> 01:24:11,546
What do you think
you're doing?

583
01:24:11,578 --> 01:24:13,613
What do you mean?

584
01:24:13,646 --> 01:24:17,652
Precautionary mandate 378
has been ordered.

585
01:24:17,685 --> 01:24:21,489
We are evacuating the
outer zone of Sector Six.

586
01:24:21,521 --> 01:24:24,324
I'm going to have to ask you turn
around and get back in line.

587
01:24:28,362 --> 01:24:30,297
No.

588
01:24:37,671 --> 01:24:40,375
What did you say?

589
01:24:45,746 --> 01:24:47,649
I said, "no."

590
01:24:50,917 --> 01:24:53,487
Stay right here.

591
01:24:54,755 --> 01:24:57,859
What are you doing?

592
01:24:57,891 --> 01:25:00,295
Just be cool.

593
01:25:10,671 --> 01:25:14,375
Hey, Max.

594
01:25:14,408 --> 01:25:17,278
What do you think
is out there?

595
01:25:31,324 --> 01:25:32,393
All right. I got visuals

596
01:25:32,426 --> 01:25:33,895
back up in northern block quad.

597
01:25:33,927 --> 01:25:37,497
I got visuals up in
Eastern block quad.

598
01:25:37,530 --> 01:25:40,434
Visuals are being confirmed.
We are back.

599
01:25:40,466 --> 01:25:42,769
We are back online, people.

600
01:25:42,802 --> 01:25:43,704
Thank God.

601
01:28:50,524 --> 01:28:53,594
What are you doing?

602
01:28:53,627 --> 01:28:56,831
Just taking a piss.

603
01:30:37,730 --> 01:30:40,867
Are we safe?

604
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,302
Simon!

605
01:32:26,372 --> 01:32:28,675
Simon!

606
01:32:28,708 --> 01:32:32,712
You gotta come see this.

607
01:32:32,746 --> 01:32:35,783
Simon, we're getting
out of here.

608
01:32:40,621 --> 01:32:42,722
Simon!

609
01:32:46,726 --> 01:32:48,930
You feeling better?

610
01:32:50,930 --> 01:32:53,733
I feel amazing.

611
01:32:55,801 --> 01:32:58,171
I wanted that for you.

612
01:32:59,405 --> 01:33:02,342
I wanted you to get out.

613
01:33:19,292 --> 01:33:23,163
I was with Eric the first
time he got arrested.

614
01:33:26,332 --> 01:33:28,835
I ratted him out.

615
01:33:38,310 --> 01:33:41,114
I know.

616
01:33:41,148 --> 01:33:43,050
He told me.

617
01:33:47,386 --> 01:33:50,857
It doesn't matter, Simon.

618
01:33:50,890 --> 01:33:52,960
You're one of us now.

619
01:34:00,100 --> 01:34:02,036
I'm not.

620
01:34:04,438 --> 01:34:07,341
I wish I was, but I'm not.

621
01:34:18,484 --> 01:34:20,420
I'm not going back.

622
01:34:27,461 --> 01:34:30,097
Nobody's asking you to.

623
01:34:36,368 --> 01:34:38,271
So what happens?

624
01:34:40,239 --> 01:34:42,975
You go back...

625
01:34:43,009 --> 01:34:46,079
You work for VOPO...

626
01:34:46,113 --> 01:34:48,849
That's it?

627
01:34:55,421 --> 01:34:57,891
I did my best to help you, Max.

628
01:35:01,994 --> 01:35:04,998
Next time,
I can't make any promises.

629
01:35:31,024 --> 01:35:33,961
This is when you run, Max.

630
01:35:39,231 --> 01:35:40,967
Run!

631
01:35:42,301 --> 01:35:44,037
Run!
