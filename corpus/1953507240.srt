1
00:31:30,347 --> 00:31:32,390
God Damn Yankees!

2
00:32:29,072 --> 00:32:31,782
You are very pretty.

3
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:35,286
A real doll.

4
00:32:37,122 --> 00:32:38,581
Not touch him!

5
00:32:38,832 --> 00:32:41,834
You doubt my honor?

6
00:32:43,712 --> 00:32:45,546
Jesus will kill the Yankees.

7
00:32:45,547 --> 00:32:49,175
And what are you doing now?
Come on, do something.

8
00:32:49,176 --> 00:32:51,802
Cursed, you bloody fool.

9
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:55,097
I've already told a million times that
you to keep your big mouth in my house.

10
00:32:55,265 --> 00:32:57,224
Where is my whip?

11
00:32:57,517 --> 00:33:00,645
Father, wait. Let me explain.

12
00:33:00,646 --> 00:33:04,231
Wait? No, my son, it is time
that you learn your lesson.

13
00:33:04,483 --> 00:33:07,026
You don't understand, he insulted my honor.

14
00:33:09,863 --> 00:33:11,197
What is this?

15
00:33:12,449 --> 00:33:13,991
When do we have here?

16
00:33:14,868 --> 00:33:17,578
The Yankees furnish us a visit.

17
00:33:18,872 --> 00:33:21,165
Or do you want to kill us?

18
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:26,963
Then you have to start with me.
Do you understand that, Yankee?

19
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:44,725
Shut up, you bastard.

20
00:35:48,605 --> 00:35:51,232
Don't you dare to touch the doll.

21
00:35:52,609 --> 00:35:54,652
You want to fight? Come on...

22
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:56,695
What is going on here?

23
00:35:56,696 --> 00:35:59,406
Do you see this jacket?

24
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:04,328
This is the uniform of a Yankee General that 
we've taken from him when he came to our country.

25
00:36:14,131 --> 00:36:17,633
Translate exactly what I say you fucking whore.

26
00:36:19,136 --> 00:36:21,679
And what are you doing now, Yankee?

27
00:36:21,847 --> 00:36:27,268
You did not understand. This land belongs 
to me, from San Pedro to Santa Barbara.

28
00:36:27,561 --> 00:36:30,229
It belongs to my family for over 200 years.

29
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:33,524
I am king and lord.
You catch that Yankee?

30
00:37:08,602 --> 00:37:09,852
We'll meet again.

31
00:39:54,601 --> 00:39:57,895
Goddamn strangers.

32
00:39:59,522 --> 00:40:01,899
Wait, wait!

33
00:40:02,567 --> 00:40:04,568
- Shut up, come on!
- Dad.

34
00:40:12,869 --> 00:40:14,078
You ass!

35
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:55,048
You are nearby.

36
00:44:08,146 --> 00:44:11,023
Stop, Carlo, stay.

37
00:44:23,244 --> 00:44:25,203
No, get up, Daddy, get up.

38
00:44:28,958 --> 00:44:31,585
O God.

39
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:39,676
He's dead, Dad, he's dead!

40
00:44:51,648 --> 00:44:53,273
Why, why?

41
00:44:53,274 --> 00:44:55,150
You have Carlo murdered dad.

42
00:44:55,151 --> 00:44:57,736
My son... my son.

43
00:45:08,790 --> 00:45:14,419
No, no daddy. Not more blood, Dad.

44
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:18,840
Daddy, please no more bloodshed.

45
00:45:18,841 --> 00:45:23,553
No more bloodshed.

46
00:45:40,988 --> 00:45:44,116
Forgive me, forgive me.

47
01:13:20,188 --> 01:13:22,272
Damn, woman, what is lost with you? 
Take my hand!

48
01:13:41,125 --> 01:13:44,044
No, do not shoot, do not shoot.

49
01:13:46,798 --> 01:13:51,802
Wait... why are you following us?

50
01:13:59,602 --> 01:14:03,063
Do not shoot!

51
01:14:23,167 --> 01:14:26,128
I'm here because of you because I love you.

52
01:14:50,486 --> 01:14:54,990
What are you doing to me?
Why am I here? You guys are insane.

53
01:15:19,515 --> 01:15:23,310
To help you... to help.

54
01:15:41,037 --> 01:15:46,833
No, I will not.

55
01:26:32,146 --> 01:26:34,647
A sling...

56
01:29:44,838 --> 01:29:47,965
Please, Father, wait...

57
01:29:48,508 --> 01:29:52,178
I have no more sons.
My only son is dead

58
01:29:52,429 --> 01:29:59,435
The grave of the man we killed, 
is here. They won't hurt you.

59
01:29:59,895 --> 01:30:03,898
I don't kill women. 
Now get out of the way.

60
01:30:04,441 --> 01:30:09,070
For heaven's sake, Father, listen to it.
You have lost everything, as we lost my brother.

61
01:30:09,613 --> 01:30:13,407
A brother. They have also lost 
a brother and a husband.

62
01:30:13,909 --> 01:30:18,204
My only son is dead,
go out of my way or I'll kill you.

63
01:30:18,747 --> 01:30:22,166
Father, please reasonable.

64
01:34:01,761 --> 01:34:05,764
Good... you .. I just want you.

65
01:34:05,974 --> 01:34:07,349
Leave him alone.

66
01:34:19,112 --> 01:34:20,154
Pick up the gun.

67
01:34:23,700 --> 01:34:27,119
You should pick up the gun, you coward.
