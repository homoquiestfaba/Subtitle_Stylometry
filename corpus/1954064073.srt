1
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:06,139
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

2
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:08,580
And welcome to our little show.

3
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:11,939
Tonight, we got ourselves...

4
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:15,939
...a bona fide multiplicitous...

5
00:04:16,418 --> 00:04:18,979
...conglomeration of cubanos...

6
00:04:19,058 --> 00:04:21,698
...on this here stage tonight.

7
00:04:23,298 --> 00:04:24,898
We got...

8
00:04:25,658 --> 00:04:28,778
...Paquito D'Rivera!

9
00:04:33,938 --> 00:04:37,217
We got Ignacio Berroa!

10
00:04:43,136 --> 00:04:44,217
And...

11
00:04:45,896 --> 00:04:48,175
...we got my newest...

12
00:04:49,376 --> 00:04:50,616
...Cuban son...

13
00:04:51,655 --> 00:04:55,135
...Arturo Sandoval.

14
00:04:56,615 --> 00:04:59,575
Here by special permission
of the Cuban government.

15
00:05:04,935 --> 00:05:06,414
I'd like to say something.

16
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:11,133
Ever since I was a little boy and...

17
00:05:11,934 --> 00:05:14,894
...since the first time I heard his music...

18
00:05:16,574 --> 00:05:20,574
...I had a dream to be able to play
with maestro Dizzy Gillespie.

19
00:05:22,293 --> 00:05:26,053
So, to me right now, life is truly a dream.

20
00:05:31,172 --> 00:05:33,091
Mari, it's me, Arturo.

21
00:05:33,371 --> 00:05:35,091
Arturo, where are you?

22
00:05:35,491 --> 00:05:36,492
I'm in Athens.

23
00:05:36,732 --> 00:05:38,051
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

24
00:05:38,971 --> 00:05:40,530
You're in London, this is it.

25
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:42,531
We're halfway there. It's all arranged.

26
00:05:42,651 --> 00:05:43,411
Tonight?

27
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:45,650
I will be in Italy tomorrow.

28
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:46,811
Be careful.

29
00:05:46,891 --> 00:05:48,611
I'll call you when I get there.

30
00:05:49,171 --> 00:05:51,251
Tell 'em none of that feta cheese.

31
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:53,531
-Got that? "Un-feta."
-You got it.

32
00:05:58,171 --> 00:05:59,890
Don't go away.

33
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:04,250
Arturo, what's going on?

34
00:06:06,769 --> 00:06:08,810
Quick, give me a cigarette.

35
00:06:20,808 --> 00:06:22,568
My wife and son are in London.

36
00:06:23,369 --> 00:06:24,648
They're where?

37
00:06:25,728 --> 00:06:27,447
We're not going back.

38
00:06:30,048 --> 00:06:31,567
It's not done yet.

39
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:34,287
It's okay. Don't worry.

40
00:06:34,927 --> 00:06:37,006
We'll get you out.

41
00:06:37,767 --> 00:06:40,247
Arturo, man, let's go.
I called the embassy.

42
00:06:40,647 --> 00:06:42,406
They're expecting us.

43
00:06:44,927 --> 00:06:46,126
What's the matter?

44
00:06:46,446 --> 00:06:48,446
I still got family there, Diz.

45
00:06:48,886 --> 00:06:53,085
When you leave, the government
punishes those you leave behind and love.

46
00:06:53,245 --> 00:06:55,726
Then are you sure you want to do this?

47
00:06:59,644 --> 00:07:02,565
I've been in jail all my life.

48
00:07:04,884 --> 00:07:06,804
Freedom's a scary thing, but...

49
00:07:06,924 --> 00:07:09,044
...I gotta get on the bird.

50
00:07:09,204 --> 00:07:10,964
Well, come on, let's do it.

51
00:07:17,124 --> 00:07:19,603
-The embassy's closed, sir.
-You better get it open.

52
00:07:19,683 --> 00:07:22,203
This is an international incident.
My Cuban friend--

53
00:07:22,283 --> 00:07:25,642
-Sir, the embassy's closed.
-Not for me. I'm Dizzy Gillespie.

54
00:07:25,762 --> 00:07:28,162
-Open the gate, Sergeant.
-Yes, sir.

55
00:07:29,962 --> 00:07:32,682
It's an honor to meet you, we got your call.

56
00:07:32,762 --> 00:07:34,282
You must be Arturo Sandoval.

57
00:07:34,402 --> 00:07:37,722
That's the second greatest
trumpet player in the world.

58
00:07:42,201 --> 00:07:43,801
Someone should be....

59
00:07:44,281 --> 00:07:46,800
-There you are.
-Good evening, gentlemen.

60
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,680
I should say, good morning.

61
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:54,640
I'm Michael Tasker.
I'm a big fan, Mr. Gillespie.

62
00:07:54,759 --> 00:07:56,520
Thank you. This is Arturo--

63
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:59,439
Arturo Sandoval, yes, petition for asylum.

64
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:01,679
How long's this gonna take?

65
00:08:01,758 --> 00:08:05,279
Red tape respects no boundaries.
That's an international fact of life.

66
00:08:05,359 --> 00:08:07,798
-If you'd like to--
-This is the American Embassy.

67
00:08:07,878 --> 00:08:11,358
I know you got some
apple pie around here.

68
00:08:11,638 --> 00:08:14,479
I think we can arrange something.

69
00:08:14,958 --> 00:08:16,837
-You be cool.
-Thank you, Diz.

70
00:08:16,958 --> 00:08:19,118
Enjoy. Right this way.

71
00:08:20,717 --> 00:08:22,876
Your Mr. Gillespie
is one of the few people...

72
00:08:22,997 --> 00:08:25,517
...who can open this place
in the middle of the night.

73
00:08:26,277 --> 00:08:29,196
Have a seat and I'll be back in a moment.

74
00:08:29,557 --> 00:08:30,836
Thank you.

75
00:08:31,836 --> 00:08:32,996
Coffee?

76
00:08:33,715 --> 00:08:35,396
Thank you, yes.

77
00:08:41,196 --> 00:08:42,476
I'm scared.

78
00:08:46,795 --> 00:08:47,915
Trust me.

79
00:09:07,953 --> 00:09:09,952
I think I should explain...

80
00:09:10,033 --> 00:09:14,512
...there are certain criteria that must be
met before we can grant asylum.

81
00:09:15,113 --> 00:09:17,954
An individual must prove
that he is unable to return...

82
00:09:18,033 --> 00:09:20,632
...to his homeland for fear of persecution.

83
00:09:20,792 --> 00:09:22,953
I understand. That's why I'm here.

84
00:09:22,993 --> 00:09:27,112
You've been touring
with Mr. Gillespie's United Nation band.

85
00:09:27,312 --> 00:09:29,592
-Are you here with your family?
-No.

86
00:09:29,672 --> 00:09:32,512
My wife and son
are waiting for me in London.

87
00:09:32,793 --> 00:09:35,232
-You're seeking asylum for them as well?
-Yes.

88
00:09:38,871 --> 00:09:40,511
Is there a problem?

89
00:09:41,551 --> 00:09:43,632
I just need some information.

90
00:09:44,671 --> 00:09:45,710
Okay.

91
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:49,791
So, you've been a musician
for how many years?

92
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:53,830
Since I was six years old.

93
00:09:55,309 --> 00:09:59,429
I taught my cat how to walk on a tight rope
while I played the bongos.

94
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:01,349
It was like an animal act.

95
00:10:03,268 --> 00:10:06,469
And you were educated at
a government-run music school?

96
00:10:06,828 --> 00:10:07,509
Yes.

97
00:10:07,948 --> 00:10:09,629
You were classically trained?

98
00:10:10,268 --> 00:10:10,948
Yes.

99
00:10:11,868 --> 00:10:15,908
It says you were a member
of the Cuban Music Academy.

100
00:10:17,827 --> 00:10:19,267
Is that right?

101
00:10:20,908 --> 00:10:21,547
Yes.

102
00:10:22,107 --> 00:10:24,187
Is that a state-sponsored organization?

103
00:10:24,946 --> 00:10:25,667
Yes.

104
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:30,346
Your first professional job....
What is that? "Orquesta--"

105
00:10:30,787 --> 00:10:33,026
Cuban Modern Music Orchestra.

106
00:10:33,786 --> 00:10:36,266
-Government sponsored?
-Yes, of course.

107
00:10:37,106 --> 00:10:39,545
If the government doesn't sponsor it,
it doesn't exist.

108
00:10:40,266 --> 00:10:44,425
Maybe I'm missing something here,
because it seems that on paper...

109
00:10:44,865 --> 00:10:47,185
...that the government
treated you quite well.

110
00:10:48,345 --> 00:10:50,344
They supported you as a musician.

111
00:10:50,464 --> 00:10:51,264
Yes.

112
00:10:54,825 --> 00:10:57,184
Yes, as long as I did what they wanted.

113
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:51,699
That's the shit!

114
00:11:52,259 --> 00:11:53,739
That's what we should be playing.

115
00:11:53,818 --> 00:11:57,019
I know!
Start a band and get on the bird and fly!

116
00:12:02,178 --> 00:12:04,338
-You haven't changed.
-What for?

117
00:12:04,738 --> 00:12:08,257
You look good, very handsome.
Even without the hair, very handsome.

118
00:12:08,338 --> 00:12:10,137
-What's this about?
-Nothing.

119
00:12:10,377 --> 00:12:13,137
Come on in, guys. Relax, please, sit down.

120
00:12:14,857 --> 00:12:16,297
Here, don't burn my couch.

121
00:12:16,457 --> 00:12:20,056
Jaime, why are we here?
What is this meeting about?

122
00:12:20,576 --> 00:12:24,216
Compañero Somavilla
brought a matter to my attention.

123
00:12:26,095 --> 00:12:30,136
I just mentioned to Jaime, that...

124
00:12:31,215 --> 00:12:33,895
...you want to start your own band.

125
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:37,256
You're own band. It's a good idea.

126
00:12:38,095 --> 00:12:40,015
It's a shame we just can't do it.

127
00:12:40,374 --> 00:12:41,454
Caballeros.

128
00:12:41,854 --> 00:12:43,614
I'm an artist just like you are.

129
00:12:44,414 --> 00:12:46,455
I understand the need to invoke the muse.

130
00:12:47,135 --> 00:12:49,575
But as Cubans,
we have to present a united front.

131
00:12:50,375 --> 00:12:51,614
Politically and musically.

132
00:12:52,174 --> 00:12:54,494
Destroying the orquesta
is not in our interests--

133
00:12:54,614 --> 00:12:55,694
No.

134
00:12:56,854 --> 00:12:58,935
We do not want to destroy anything.

135
00:12:59,054 --> 00:13:00,974
Just the best band in Cuba, that's all.

136
00:13:01,053 --> 00:13:02,973
There's room for
another great band in Cuba.

137
00:13:03,053 --> 00:13:06,893
Normally I'd agree with you
but we're living in times of scarcity now.

138
00:13:06,973 --> 00:13:08,693
Exactly. Besides....

139
00:13:08,853 --> 00:13:12,773
I just can't see why you can't play
what you want in the orquesta.

140
00:13:12,892 --> 00:13:15,813
In the orquesta,
we play what you want us to play.

141
00:13:16,132 --> 00:13:17,492
We need to experiment.

142
00:13:17,572 --> 00:13:19,252
You don't want to experiment.

143
00:13:19,572 --> 00:13:23,251
You just don't want to play our music.
You want to play their music.

144
00:13:23,451 --> 00:13:26,772
-The music of the enemy.
-What is the music of the enemy?

145
00:13:26,811 --> 00:13:28,411
That's enough!

146
00:13:29,491 --> 00:13:32,331
Our comrades are losing
their lives in Angola.

147
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:35,091
You guys are thinking
about your little music.

148
00:13:35,131 --> 00:13:37,290
Just about yourselves!
There's no time for that.

149
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:39,569
There are limits!

150
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:41,850
There are limits!

151
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:50,209
-Leave the cowboys alone.
-I never saw that picture before.

152
00:13:50,289 --> 00:13:52,329
I don't care, this is dominoes.

153
00:13:52,689 --> 00:13:55,688
-Pay attention to the game!
-One more coffee, please.

154
00:13:56,089 --> 00:13:58,169
Wait, it's not your turn.

155
00:14:02,608 --> 00:14:03,848
Gracias, Mama.

156
00:14:05,288 --> 00:14:07,928
Your coffee is like a wake-up kiss
in the morning.

157
00:14:08,168 --> 00:14:11,607
Cirita bonita, tan bella y sabrosita.

158
00:14:13,287 --> 00:14:14,647
Gracias.

159
00:14:19,086 --> 00:14:21,525
Tastes like the fourth time
through on these grounds.

160
00:14:22,366 --> 00:14:23,846
You boys wanna play?

161
00:14:26,805 --> 00:14:28,166
Maybe later, Papi.

162
00:14:31,685 --> 00:14:33,365
This is going nowhere.

163
00:14:34,205 --> 00:14:35,565
You heard Jaime?

164
00:14:35,685 --> 00:14:38,205
They pull us out of venues.
They pull the equipment.

165
00:14:38,285 --> 00:14:39,644
They won't ever do it.

166
00:14:41,525 --> 00:14:43,445
We'll be so good they'll have to support us.

167
00:14:43,525 --> 00:14:45,844
How are you gonna get 'em
to support a jazz band?

168
00:14:45,924 --> 00:14:48,805
Never call it " jazz."
Don't ever even use the word.

169
00:14:48,844 --> 00:14:50,844
They'll know. They'll hear it.

170
00:14:51,124 --> 00:14:53,964
These guys, they're not musicians,
they're bureaucrats.

171
00:14:54,163 --> 00:14:56,603
You're Cuban, I'm Cuban. Chucho's Cuban.

172
00:14:56,723 --> 00:14:59,403
Whatever we play
is gonna be Cuban music.

173
00:15:00,163 --> 00:15:02,923
We'll need some kind of camouflage,
you know?

174
00:15:13,202 --> 00:15:14,121
Congas.

175
00:15:14,881 --> 00:15:16,762
Big ones.

176
00:15:19,321 --> 00:15:21,641
-Up front.
-Up front!

177
00:16:44,675 --> 00:16:46,354
We called ourselves "Irakere."

178
00:16:46,594 --> 00:16:48,433
It's an African word meaning, " jungle."

179
00:16:49,474 --> 00:16:50,994
We played jazz...

180
00:16:51,593 --> 00:16:53,474
...but we gave it our own swing.

181
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:55,354
Wait a minute, excuse me.

182
00:16:55,673 --> 00:16:57,313
They didn't stop you.

183
00:16:57,553 --> 00:16:59,233
And this band was a success.

184
00:16:59,753 --> 00:17:00,313
Yes.

185
00:17:01,193 --> 00:17:03,033
The camouflage we had worked.

186
00:17:03,232 --> 00:17:05,151
You toured extensively.

187
00:17:05,633 --> 00:17:07,512
You did a record for CBS.

188
00:17:07,752 --> 00:17:09,472
You even won a Grammy.

189
00:17:10,351 --> 00:17:13,632
It seems like the government
didn't care what you were playing.

190
00:17:14,231 --> 00:17:17,872
They chose not to notice because we
were making a lot of money for them.

191
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:23,670
I imagine you were making some money
for yourself as well?

192
00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:26,431
It doesn't work that way.

193
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:29,470
The clubs pay
the Ministry of Culture directly.

194
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:30,990
All we got was meal money.

195
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:34,949
You know you can make a lot more
money if you weren't in Cuba.

196
00:17:35,069 --> 00:17:36,950
It's not about the money.

197
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:38,710
It's about the music.

198
00:17:38,749 --> 00:17:42,149
They let you play the kind of music
that you wanted.

199
00:17:42,349 --> 00:17:44,869
American jazz and Gershwin and Ellington--

200
00:17:44,989 --> 00:17:49,508
You're always taking a risk because in
Cuba you never know where the line is.

201
00:17:50,308 --> 00:17:52,467
You can play Gershwin once too often.

202
00:17:53,788 --> 00:17:56,828
Not being able to play Gershwin
does not constitute persecution.

203
00:17:57,027 --> 00:18:00,668
It is if they decide it's
counter-revolutionary and you're put in jail.

204
00:18:00,827 --> 00:18:03,107
In Cuba you live with that fear every day.

205
00:18:03,186 --> 00:18:05,906
Someone might come to you,
your house, your family...

206
00:18:05,987 --> 00:18:08,386
...and hurt you because of a song.

207
00:18:09,147 --> 00:18:10,426
Just a song.

208
00:18:11,866 --> 00:18:13,625
And that is persecution.

209
00:18:15,026 --> 00:18:17,266
If you felt that strongly about it...

210
00:18:18,265 --> 00:18:20,506
...why didn't you defect earlier?

211
00:18:21,905 --> 00:18:24,585
I was about to. I had it all planned out.

212
00:18:26,225 --> 00:18:28,184
But you stayed.

213
00:18:30,265 --> 00:18:31,385
Let's go!

214
00:18:35,424 --> 00:18:37,224
Life has it's own plan.

215
00:18:37,904 --> 00:18:39,344
Let's go!

216
00:18:40,304 --> 00:18:41,384
C'mon!

217
00:18:41,983 --> 00:18:43,143
C'mon, let's go!

218
00:18:43,703 --> 00:18:46,263
I'm here, let's go. The bus is coming!

219
00:18:47,024 --> 00:18:50,102
C'mon, what are you waiting for?

220
00:18:50,743 --> 00:18:53,902
If you don't get this one,
there won't be another bus for hours!

221
00:18:55,062 --> 00:18:57,142
-I'm with him.
-C'mon!

222
00:18:58,862 --> 00:19:01,262
I've been here all along, right here.

223
00:19:01,662 --> 00:19:02,981
She's with me.

224
00:19:03,381 --> 00:19:05,461
She's the love of my life.

225
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:12,021
By the way, what's your name?

226
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:17,341
"Marianela Marianela

227
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:19,220
"Marianela

228
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:21,619
"When she walks

229
00:19:21,779 --> 00:19:24,099
"All the buses have to stop

230
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:27,139
"And when she laughs

231
00:19:29,819 --> 00:19:31,259
"She has to cry"

232
00:19:31,539 --> 00:19:32,980
What's wrong?

233
00:19:37,058 --> 00:19:38,819
My mother just died...

234
00:19:39,699 --> 00:19:41,138
...a week ago.

235
00:19:44,219 --> 00:19:45,498
I'm sorry.

236
00:19:53,457 --> 00:19:56,418
Did your mother have
something against laughing?

237
00:20:03,377 --> 00:20:05,817
-Where are you going?
-This is my stop.

238
00:20:05,897 --> 00:20:07,657
Really? Mine, too.

239
00:20:08,376 --> 00:20:10,097
What a coincidence.

240
00:20:11,536 --> 00:20:13,216
I wanna see you before I go.

241
00:20:13,296 --> 00:20:15,016
What's the point if you are leaving?

242
00:20:15,576 --> 00:20:17,575
Why does there have to be a point?

243
00:20:18,616 --> 00:20:20,496
When does your tour finish?

244
00:20:21,896 --> 00:20:23,215
In a month.

245
00:20:23,695 --> 00:20:25,215
Let's have dinner.

246
00:20:26,095 --> 00:20:27,095
Ask me when you get back.

247
00:20:27,175 --> 00:20:29,175
That's too long,
I need to see you before I go.

248
00:20:29,254 --> 00:20:30,454
What's the hurry?

249
00:20:30,735 --> 00:20:32,694
I'm afraid you might forget me.

250
00:20:34,934 --> 00:20:36,574
That's very unlikely.

251
00:20:36,774 --> 00:20:39,174
CUBAN MINISTRY OF COMMERCE

252
00:20:41,133 --> 00:20:44,253
Excuse me, do you work here
at the foreign trade ministry?

253
00:20:44,653 --> 00:20:45,692
Sí.

254
00:20:46,574 --> 00:20:48,853
Don't tell me that you work here as well.

255
00:20:48,933 --> 00:20:50,092
No.

256
00:20:50,612 --> 00:20:51,893
I don't think so.

257
00:20:54,492 --> 00:20:55,852
Is there a problem?

258
00:20:56,251 --> 00:20:58,332
No problem.

259
00:21:00,971 --> 00:21:02,892
"Marianela Marianela

260
00:21:03,251 --> 00:21:04,891
"Marianela"

261
00:21:05,811 --> 00:21:07,891
I'm gonna see you before I go!

262
00:21:10,851 --> 00:21:12,490
That's a warning!

263
00:21:16,530 --> 00:21:18,531
These are the East German purchases.

264
00:21:18,851 --> 00:21:20,450
She sold everything?

265
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:22,769
And she actually left.

266
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:24,810
To Miami?

267
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:28,570
Both kids, the mother, the father,
the grandmother, on a raft.

268
00:21:29,289 --> 00:21:31,569
This is Cuca we're talking about.

269
00:21:31,849 --> 00:21:33,128
What happened to Cuca?

270
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:36,768
They left a couple of weeks ago
from Cojimar at about 3:00 in the morning!

271
00:21:36,809 --> 00:21:38,648
-The whole family?
-Yes.

272
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:41,248
The whole family, even the dog.

273
00:21:41,288 --> 00:21:43,447
-The dog?
-Good thing she escaped.

274
00:21:43,528 --> 00:21:45,568
She didn't escape. She gave up.

275
00:21:46,088 --> 00:21:48,327
She gave up because
things got a little tough.

276
00:21:48,407 --> 00:21:49,928
She wanted to go shopping in Miami.

277
00:21:50,007 --> 00:21:52,327
Please, she bought everything
she could in Havana.

278
00:21:56,247 --> 00:21:58,966
-Hello?
-May I speak to Marianela, please?

279
00:21:59,446 --> 00:22:01,526
Marianela, for you.

280
00:22:03,846 --> 00:22:05,125
Oigo?

281
00:22:05,285 --> 00:22:06,406
-Marianela?
-Sí.

282
00:22:06,646 --> 00:22:08,646
-Arturo.
-Who?

283
00:22:09,445 --> 00:22:11,046
Arturo Sandoval.

284
00:22:11,486 --> 00:22:13,125
You don't remember me?

285
00:22:13,445 --> 00:22:16,445
Of course I remember you.
It's been less than an hour.

286
00:22:18,124 --> 00:22:20,444
Listen, you like baseball?

287
00:22:21,925 --> 00:22:23,445
Do I like baseball?

288
00:23:42,597 --> 00:23:44,638
What are you doing out here?

289
00:23:44,837 --> 00:23:46,717
This is where I practice.

290
00:23:47,397 --> 00:23:49,757
I like to come here 'cause the music....

291
00:23:49,917 --> 00:23:52,077
My playing comes back to me like a wave.

292
00:23:53,037 --> 00:23:54,556
What were you playing?

293
00:23:55,276 --> 00:23:56,677
Something I just wrote.

294
00:23:57,237 --> 00:23:58,317
What is it called?

295
00:23:59,436 --> 00:24:00,876
Marianela.

296
00:24:08,395 --> 00:24:09,235
Really.

297
00:24:13,635 --> 00:24:15,155
Put your hand on my heart.

298
00:24:15,834 --> 00:24:16,834
Right here.

299
00:24:43,593 --> 00:24:44,673
Nice.

300
00:24:46,952 --> 00:24:47,992
Nice.

301
00:24:49,072 --> 00:24:50,592
What's her name?

302
00:24:51,832 --> 00:24:53,031
Marianela.

303
00:24:53,271 --> 00:24:56,071
-Where does she live?
-None of your business.

304
00:24:58,711 --> 00:25:00,871
She was the waitress
we were chasing around--

305
00:25:00,951 --> 00:25:01,951
You were chasing.

306
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:04,511
Marianela works for the government.

307
00:25:04,591 --> 00:25:05,630
The government?

308
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:08,550
You think I'm crazy?

309
00:25:08,629 --> 00:25:11,590
I think you're in love and
that's a dangerous place to be.

310
00:25:12,309 --> 00:25:14,350
What are you talking about?

311
00:25:20,589 --> 00:25:22,989
You know I wanna leave.
I can't take my family.

312
00:25:23,349 --> 00:25:26,428
You're free. You get on that plane,
you never come back.

313
00:25:26,868 --> 00:25:28,908
You get hooked, you're stuck.

314
00:25:29,987 --> 00:25:32,668
Don't complicate your life, hermano, okay?

315
00:25:42,227 --> 00:25:43,587
There she is.

316
00:25:44,787 --> 00:25:46,106
What do you think?

317
00:25:50,586 --> 00:25:52,307
It's worse than I thought.

318
00:25:52,506 --> 00:25:54,746
Be careful. You know how it works.

319
00:25:54,906 --> 00:25:58,026
They get a spy to dress up
like the woman of your dreams.

320
00:26:10,184 --> 00:26:12,304
It must be quite a temptation for you.

321
00:26:12,865 --> 00:26:13,504
What?

322
00:26:13,585 --> 00:26:15,624
Traveling to all those countries.

323
00:26:15,704 --> 00:26:17,704
Nice cars, nice clothes.

324
00:26:19,704 --> 00:26:23,102
Do you ever want to get off
the plane and not come back?

325
00:26:28,142 --> 00:26:29,783
You know, Arturo...

326
00:26:30,703 --> 00:26:32,383
...you'd miss Cuba.

327
00:26:33,622 --> 00:26:36,822
You'd miss the way
everything smells like sugar.

328
00:26:37,662 --> 00:26:39,502
You'd miss the baseball.

329
00:26:39,902 --> 00:26:41,582
You'd miss our music.

330
00:26:44,423 --> 00:26:46,103
I'm still sitting here.

331
00:26:50,182 --> 00:26:52,782
I don't understand why people leave Cuba.

332
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:56,461
Especially you, who's gotten
so many things from the revolution.

333
00:26:57,141 --> 00:26:58,501
Marianela.

334
00:27:00,381 --> 00:27:03,260
My talent comes from God, not Fidel.

335
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:14,699
Do I have "defector"
written on my forehead?

336
00:27:15,579 --> 00:27:17,259
What are we talking about here?

337
00:27:18,339 --> 00:27:20,538
Do you get this nervous on stage?

338
00:27:22,139 --> 00:27:23,739
Only at auditions.

339
00:27:28,619 --> 00:27:30,058
How am I doing?

340
00:27:33,778 --> 00:27:35,577
I'm still sitting here.

341
00:27:43,018 --> 00:27:44,137
Wait!

342
00:27:45,897 --> 00:27:46,936
Wait!

343
00:27:47,016 --> 00:27:48,337
This is Marianela!

344
00:27:48,417 --> 00:27:50,856
When she walks,
all the buses have to stop!

345
00:27:54,216 --> 00:27:55,856
That was the last bus.

346
00:27:55,935 --> 00:27:57,975
That was the only bus.

347
00:28:00,175 --> 00:28:01,415
Okay.

348
00:28:11,174 --> 00:28:12,933
What are you gonna do?

349
00:28:13,613 --> 00:28:15,094
I don't know.

350
00:28:19,174 --> 00:28:21,694
I could stay at my friend's apartment.

351
00:28:22,293 --> 00:28:23,973
I should call home.

352
00:28:32,612 --> 00:28:34,092
It was a lovely day.

353
00:28:34,572 --> 00:28:35,653
Yes.

354
00:28:36,373 --> 00:28:38,372
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

355
00:28:39,171 --> 00:28:40,452
Goodnight.

356
00:28:43,451 --> 00:28:45,330
I'll walk you there. Come on.

357
00:28:45,412 --> 00:28:46,731
No, it's okay--

358
00:28:46,811 --> 00:28:48,890
It's okay? Okay then, let's go.

359
00:28:48,931 --> 00:28:50,130
Come on.

360
00:28:51,451 --> 00:28:53,010
I'll protect you.

361
00:28:57,211 --> 00:28:58,850
I also was married.

362
00:28:59,130 --> 00:29:02,050
It was a mistake.
The husband, not the son.

363
00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:05,009
-You have a son?
-Yes, he's eight.

364
00:29:05,249 --> 00:29:07,330
-Eight?
-I was very young.

365
00:29:08,129 --> 00:29:09,369
Very young.

366
00:29:11,209 --> 00:29:12,729
She lives here?

367
00:29:17,609 --> 00:29:19,408
It's not much further.

368
00:29:47,885 --> 00:29:48,886
Emilia?

369
00:29:51,125 --> 00:29:52,205
Emi?

370
00:29:56,084 --> 00:29:58,803
She must be staying
at the colonel's house.

371
00:30:00,285 --> 00:30:02,204
-The colonel?
-Yes.

372
00:30:03,844 --> 00:30:05,364
She has a colonel?

373
00:30:06,363 --> 00:30:07,284
Yes.

374
00:30:13,124 --> 00:30:14,644
Thank you for the walk.

375
00:30:20,444 --> 00:30:21,723
Goodnight.

376
00:30:22,963 --> 00:30:24,123
Mari.

377
00:31:14,079 --> 00:31:16,198
Are you really leaving tomorrow?

378
00:31:17,478 --> 00:31:19,159
That's what I told you, yes.

379
00:31:19,678 --> 00:31:22,117
Will you promise me you won't come back?

380
00:31:23,037 --> 00:31:24,838
I don't understand. What are you saying?

381
00:31:24,957 --> 00:31:27,637
Promise me you won't come back
and I'll be with you tonight.

382
00:31:28,037 --> 00:31:29,038
Why?

383
00:31:34,077 --> 00:31:35,356
Because...

384
00:31:35,796 --> 00:31:38,076
...I'm afraid I might fall in love with you.

385
00:31:42,956 --> 00:31:44,596
It would never work.

386
00:31:45,356 --> 00:31:48,035
-We are too different.
-Different is good.

387
00:31:48,115 --> 00:31:50,755
Promise me this will be our only night.

388
00:31:56,515 --> 00:31:57,675
I don't understand.

389
00:31:57,714 --> 00:32:00,795
If I promise you, you'll be with me tonight?

390
00:32:03,633 --> 00:32:05,834
-I promise.
-I'm serious.

391
00:32:09,634 --> 00:32:10,834
Promise me.

392
00:32:13,713 --> 00:32:15,272
I promise.

393
00:33:23,906 --> 00:33:25,506
I'll be there in a minute!

394
00:33:25,587 --> 00:33:26,946
Smells good!

395
00:33:31,306 --> 00:33:33,546
Come on, Willis.

396
00:34:12,423 --> 00:34:17,503
Hey there, this is Willis Canover
bringing you jazz on the Voice of America.

397
00:34:18,263 --> 00:34:19,743
Yes, go on, Willis.

398
00:34:20,183 --> 00:34:21,622
What are you listening to?

399
00:34:21,902 --> 00:34:24,342
Dizzy's Atmosphere, Dizzy Gillespie.

400
00:34:24,862 --> 00:34:28,222
Charlie Parker live at Carnegie Hall, 1947.

401
00:34:29,342 --> 00:34:31,821
Side B, track two.

402
00:34:32,581 --> 00:34:33,862
You know what I mean.

403
00:34:36,901 --> 00:34:38,302
It's just music.

404
00:34:39,941 --> 00:34:41,100
Great music.

405
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:43,621
You're not supposed to
listen to that station.

406
00:34:55,140 --> 00:34:56,499
Now we're safe.

407
00:34:57,259 --> 00:34:58,818
It's not funny.

408
00:34:59,299 --> 00:35:01,539
You could get in trouble.

409
00:35:01,819 --> 00:35:03,778
Believe me, I know.

410
00:35:03,938 --> 00:35:07,738
I spent four months
in military jail for listening to that.

411
00:35:09,098 --> 00:35:11,098
I think I earned the right.

412
00:35:15,497 --> 00:35:16,897
Time to go.

413
00:35:18,537 --> 00:35:21,057
You have your tour and I have my work.

414
00:35:31,696 --> 00:35:33,376
What are you doing?

415
00:35:41,615 --> 00:35:43,295
What are you doing?

416
00:35:44,415 --> 00:35:46,134
Memorizing your face.

417
00:35:58,654 --> 00:35:59,813
Oyeme!

418
00:36:01,173 --> 00:36:02,253
Are we going?

419
00:36:06,773 --> 00:36:07,734
What?

420
00:36:17,371 --> 00:36:20,292
Tell me one thing. Can the colonel dance?

421
00:36:21,091 --> 00:36:22,171
Please.

422
00:36:22,491 --> 00:36:23,892
Do you love him?

423
00:36:24,531 --> 00:36:25,811
Ay, chica.

424
00:36:30,810 --> 00:36:32,210
C'mon, let's go.

425
00:36:35,170 --> 00:36:36,170
I'm here.

426
00:36:38,410 --> 00:36:39,970
See you tomorrow.

427
00:36:51,009 --> 00:36:53,448
You promised you wouldn't come back.

428
00:36:53,888 --> 00:36:56,288
The last promise I'll ever break to you.

429
00:36:58,528 --> 00:37:01,088
-She wasn't an informer?
-Of course not.

430
00:37:02,207 --> 00:37:04,687
-But she did work for the government?
-Yes.

431
00:37:05,968 --> 00:37:08,288
She's still a member of the Party?

432
00:37:08,888 --> 00:37:09,808
Yes.

433
00:37:10,287 --> 00:37:11,968
She's an active member?

434
00:37:12,088 --> 00:37:13,648
Not anymore.

435
00:37:13,808 --> 00:37:15,887
She sees things
completely differently now.

436
00:37:17,928 --> 00:37:20,886
That's convenient,
now that you're seeking asylum.

437
00:37:25,526 --> 00:37:26,647
"Convenient."

438
00:37:26,807 --> 00:37:28,846
It seems that her politics didn't bother you.

439
00:37:28,927 --> 00:37:30,325
I never said that.

440
00:37:31,005 --> 00:37:32,966
We had many disagreements
about politics.

441
00:37:33,046 --> 00:37:34,686
You had disagreements?

442
00:37:35,245 --> 00:37:38,005
You claim to be on opposite ends
of the political spectrum.

443
00:37:38,086 --> 00:37:41,444
How can two people that far apart
stay together?

444
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:42,919
Papi and Leonel, this is Arturo.

445
00:38:50,198 --> 00:38:52,198
Mucho gusto, Señor Sosa.

446
00:39:03,597 --> 00:39:04,557
Leonel.

447
00:39:05,197 --> 00:39:07,157
Say hello to Arturo.

448
00:39:11,837 --> 00:39:13,716
I'm sorry, I'll be back.

449
00:39:22,115 --> 00:39:24,036
What's so great about him?

450
00:39:24,396 --> 00:39:25,715
He's funny.

451
00:39:26,195 --> 00:39:27,756
He makes me feel good.

452
00:39:29,115 --> 00:39:30,635
You are the musician.

453
00:39:30,715 --> 00:39:32,195
Trumpet player.

454
00:39:32,434 --> 00:39:33,915
Trumpet player.

455
00:39:38,714 --> 00:39:40,315
Mr. Trumpet Player.

456
00:39:41,874 --> 00:39:45,194
May I know what are your intentions
with my daughter?

457
00:39:49,113 --> 00:39:50,594
I want to marry her.

458
00:39:53,994 --> 00:39:57,632
I want to have a son with her
and live with her for the rest of my life.

459
00:40:00,912 --> 00:40:02,872
She never mentioned that to me.

460
00:40:03,352 --> 00:40:05,192
I haven't asked her yet.

461
00:40:06,632 --> 00:40:09,231
Señor Sosa, with all due respect...

462
00:40:09,471 --> 00:40:12,151
...I know when you look at me,
what you're thinking.

463
00:40:12,231 --> 00:40:14,070
I'm a musician, she's your daughter--

464
00:40:14,151 --> 00:40:16,871
I suppose you would like
to move into my house.

465
00:40:18,111 --> 00:40:19,710
Yes, for a little bit.

466
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:29,550
I have something for you.

467
00:40:33,589 --> 00:40:35,348
It's soap from London.

468
00:40:36,391 --> 00:40:37,710
You keep it.

469
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:43,749
-You know Félix Chapotín?
-Of course.

470
00:40:44,029 --> 00:40:46,428
I was admiring your taste in music.

471
00:40:47,269 --> 00:40:49,949
Now, he was a trumpet player.

472
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:53,669
You like baseball?

473
00:40:53,829 --> 00:40:57,428
Maybe we can go see my favorite team,
Los Industriales.

474
00:40:58,668 --> 00:41:00,908
You're trying to make me like you.

475
00:41:01,707 --> 00:41:03,188
How am I doing?

476
00:41:05,107 --> 00:41:06,347
Not good?

477
00:41:07,187 --> 00:41:08,748
Let's try a bribe.

478
00:41:08,827 --> 00:41:09,907
Sandwich?

479
00:41:11,107 --> 00:41:12,067
No?

480
00:41:12,706 --> 00:41:14,107
It's turkey.

481
00:41:14,706 --> 00:41:16,066
Turkey sandwich.

482
00:41:16,146 --> 00:41:18,787
When's the last time
you had a turkey sandwich?

483
00:41:18,907 --> 00:41:20,706
Never. Where do you get it?

484
00:41:21,186 --> 00:41:22,505
Right there.

485
00:41:24,306 --> 00:41:25,665
That's not turkey.

486
00:41:27,585 --> 00:41:29,505
-What is it?
-That's vulture.

487
00:41:29,825 --> 00:41:30,785
Vulture?

488
00:41:37,624 --> 00:41:40,264
No, it's not. It's turkey from heaven.

489
00:41:46,264 --> 00:41:47,304
Bad news.

490
00:41:49,183 --> 00:41:50,304
You know him?

491
00:41:50,544 --> 00:41:52,143
Who doesn't know him?

492
00:41:52,223 --> 00:41:53,623
Is he in the Party?

493
00:41:54,863 --> 00:41:56,783
I don't think he's in anything.

494
00:41:56,863 --> 00:42:00,423
He belongs to a different world.
Different way of thinking.

495
00:42:01,023 --> 00:42:03,862
I don't understand you
and neither will anybody else.

496
00:42:04,221 --> 00:42:07,462
You have a good position here,
a wonderful reputation.

497
00:42:07,822 --> 00:42:09,382
Why do you want to risk it?

498
00:42:09,461 --> 00:42:11,382
I'm old enough to know what I'm doing.

499
00:42:11,621 --> 00:42:14,261
Not as old as his first wife.

500
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:16,701
You know his first wife?

501
00:42:16,821 --> 00:42:18,421
Alba Marina.

502
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:21,501
Alba Marina, the singer?

503
00:42:21,821 --> 00:42:25,300
Honey, what else don't you know
about the man you're gonna marry?

504
00:42:27,501 --> 00:42:29,459
We hear what they want us to hear.

505
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:31,820
We play what they want us to play.

506
00:42:32,540 --> 00:42:34,579
You know what we're missing?

507
00:42:35,019 --> 00:42:36,379
Miles Davis.

508
00:42:36,618 --> 00:42:39,419
Charles Mingus, Maynard Ferguson.

509
00:42:40,219 --> 00:42:43,619
While the rest of the world
is painting rainbows, we paint in one color.

510
00:42:43,698 --> 00:42:45,938
Me? I'm getting outta here.

511
00:42:47,338 --> 00:42:48,858
What about your family?

512
00:42:49,737 --> 00:42:51,458
I'll get them out somehow.

513
00:42:59,617 --> 00:43:00,617
Look.

514
00:43:07,656 --> 00:43:10,736
I'm sick and tired
of playing these fucking games!

515
00:43:12,016 --> 00:43:13,095
Be careful.

516
00:43:13,856 --> 00:43:17,295
Everybody in Cuba has an ear
and not only for music.

517
00:43:54,452 --> 00:43:55,891
Where have you been?

518
00:43:57,972 --> 00:44:00,291
-What is it?
-Somebody's following me.

519
00:44:01,011 --> 00:44:02,051
What?

520
00:44:02,291 --> 00:44:04,131
Somebody's following me.

521
00:44:09,812 --> 00:44:12,331
He was not supposed to be following you.

522
00:44:12,731 --> 00:44:13,771
Wait....

523
00:44:15,651 --> 00:44:17,051
You know him?

524
00:44:19,211 --> 00:44:21,130
He's a friend of Emilia's.

525
00:44:22,371 --> 00:44:25,130
He was only supposed to ask around.

526
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:33,289
He's been looking for things.

527
00:44:33,370 --> 00:44:34,969
-What?
-About you.

528
00:44:35,729 --> 00:44:37,288
About me? Why?

529
00:44:40,288 --> 00:44:42,049
Because I asked him to.

530
00:44:42,688 --> 00:44:44,169
-You asked him?
-Yes.

531
00:44:44,848 --> 00:44:47,687
If you want to know something about me,
why don't you ask me?

532
00:44:47,768 --> 00:44:50,208
Because I don't know if I can trust you.

533
00:44:50,287 --> 00:44:52,527
You don't trust me?
I've told you everything.

534
00:44:52,567 --> 00:44:54,208
That's not true.

535
00:44:55,367 --> 00:44:57,767
You never told me about Alba Marina.

536
00:45:00,687 --> 00:45:03,366
-I told you I was married!
-Not to Alba Marina.

537
00:45:03,686 --> 00:45:07,406
What difference does it make?
Do you have any doubts that I love you?

538
00:45:07,446 --> 00:45:08,926
Listen, Arturo.

539
00:45:09,206 --> 00:45:11,566
I had one husband walk out on me.

540
00:45:11,606 --> 00:45:13,525
He walked out on you and your son.

541
00:45:13,605 --> 00:45:15,846
Yes, and I won't go through that again!

542
00:45:15,886 --> 00:45:17,846
Don't compare me to him!

543
00:46:36,558 --> 00:46:37,957
Go home.

544
00:46:44,758 --> 00:46:45,917
You all right?

545
00:46:47,317 --> 00:46:50,157
You're not gonna have a heart attack,
are you?

546
00:46:51,956 --> 00:46:53,916
You scared the hell out of me.

547
00:46:56,516 --> 00:46:57,916
I'm better now.

548
00:46:58,116 --> 00:46:59,675
Stop following me.

549
00:47:00,876 --> 00:47:03,075
I'm not coming around here no more.

550
00:47:04,955 --> 00:47:07,075
You were such a nice couple.

551
00:47:08,035 --> 00:47:09,115
Thanks.

552
00:47:12,355 --> 00:47:14,874
-You gonna make it home okay?
-Can't go home.

553
00:47:15,514 --> 00:47:16,514
Why?

554
00:47:16,995 --> 00:47:18,994
Because my wife kicked me out.

555
00:47:22,874 --> 00:47:26,554
Did you hear the one about Fidel's zoo?

556
00:47:26,754 --> 00:47:27,714
No.

557
00:47:32,514 --> 00:47:36,273
In 1960, there was a sign there saying:

558
00:47:36,354 --> 00:47:39,153
"Please don't feed the animals."

559
00:47:40,033 --> 00:47:43,433
In 1970, they changed that sign
for another one saying:

560
00:47:44,192 --> 00:47:47,512
"Please don't eat the animals' food."

561
00:47:48,953 --> 00:47:52,272
Yesterday, they changed the sign
for another one saying:

562
00:47:53,392 --> 00:47:56,271
"Please don't eat the animals."

563
00:47:59,711 --> 00:48:00,991
Isn't that funny?

564
00:48:05,071 --> 00:48:06,951
-You're a comedian.
-No.

565
00:48:09,990 --> 00:48:11,710
I am an orthopedist.

566
00:48:14,150 --> 00:48:15,990
Don't laugh, it's true!

567
00:48:16,070 --> 00:48:17,870
Yes, bone surgeon.

568
00:48:18,149 --> 00:48:19,630
That's me.

569
00:48:20,470 --> 00:48:24,149
I'm honored. A specialist.
I'm honored, doctor.

570
00:48:25,909 --> 00:48:28,548
You know the real money's
in the taxi business.

571
00:48:28,668 --> 00:48:32,309
I have a cousin who drives a taxi
and he gets a lot of money.

572
00:48:32,508 --> 00:48:34,428
I endorse. That's very important.

573
00:48:34,588 --> 00:48:36,188
He's a doctor, too?

574
00:48:36,348 --> 00:48:37,788
Don't laugh...

575
00:48:38,787 --> 00:48:40,188
...physicist!

576
00:48:45,386 --> 00:48:49,666
We have the most talented
taxi drivers in the world!

577
00:49:17,305 --> 00:49:18,984
How did you find me?

578
00:49:19,225 --> 00:49:20,984
The doctor brought me.

579
00:49:24,024 --> 00:49:25,784
The shawl is beautiful.

580
00:49:31,343 --> 00:49:33,903
You should have asked me about Alba.

581
00:49:35,783 --> 00:49:37,942
-I came here--
-I'm not finished.

582
00:49:42,342 --> 00:49:44,382
-Arturo--
-I'm not finished.

583
00:49:49,382 --> 00:49:51,221
What do you want to say?

584
00:49:52,501 --> 00:49:53,941
I don't know.

585
00:50:00,181 --> 00:50:02,060
What I feel about you...

586
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:04,780
...I've never felt it before.

587
00:50:06,220 --> 00:50:09,579
I don't know how to feel it. I don't trust it.

588
00:50:14,179 --> 00:50:17,978
What if I told you that I love you?
Just because I love you.

589
00:50:18,139 --> 00:50:20,138
No reason, I just love you.

590
00:50:20,499 --> 00:50:22,699
I loved you the first time I saw you.

591
00:50:22,778 --> 00:50:25,217
You're here with me now and I love you.
I love you.

592
00:50:25,298 --> 00:50:27,298
You could send 100 guys to follow me.

593
00:50:27,458 --> 00:50:30,057
All they'll ever find out is that I love you.

594
00:50:30,097 --> 00:50:31,937
I love you.

595
00:50:37,818 --> 00:50:39,216
You trust me?

596
00:50:49,296 --> 00:50:51,096
Ay, hijo mío.

597
00:50:51,936 --> 00:50:56,295
You found yourself a good woman
and you're gonna be a great father.

598
00:50:56,415 --> 00:50:58,376
-And a great husband.
-Gracias.

599
00:50:59,255 --> 00:51:02,576
Great father, great husband,
But lousy domino player.

600
00:51:54,810 --> 00:51:57,130
Sounds like a wedding to me!

601
00:51:58,410 --> 00:51:59,690
Ay, chica.

602
00:52:03,170 --> 00:52:05,770
-You look amazing.
-Thank you.

603
00:52:06,131 --> 00:52:07,809
Where is everybody?

604
00:52:07,850 --> 00:52:10,569
Oye, oye! Don't I get to kiss the groom?

605
00:52:11,089 --> 00:52:12,769
-Once.
-Come on!

606
00:52:16,049 --> 00:52:17,769
Havin' a good time!

607
00:52:25,888 --> 00:52:27,008
Thank you.

608
00:52:27,688 --> 00:52:31,047
You better be good to her,
or I'll have to talk to the colonel.

609
00:52:31,127 --> 00:52:33,088
-I promise.
-Okay.

610
00:52:33,607 --> 00:52:34,887
I promise.

611
00:53:03,284 --> 00:53:06,244
You know, Rosalina has a migraine,
poor thing.

612
00:53:06,564 --> 00:53:08,044
What about Yami?

613
00:53:09,485 --> 00:53:11,964
-Militia duty.
-What about the rest?

614
00:53:12,484 --> 00:53:14,364
I'm here. I came, didn't I?

615
00:53:18,123 --> 00:53:20,044
I'm sorry, I have to go.

616
00:53:20,563 --> 00:53:22,282
Is that the colonel?

617
00:53:23,362 --> 00:53:25,483
Ask him in, he's welcome here.

618
00:53:27,522 --> 00:53:29,482
I'm sorry, I really have to go.

619
00:53:33,561 --> 00:53:35,322
You look wonderful.

620
00:53:36,282 --> 00:53:38,081
You look like a virgin.

621
00:53:43,041 --> 00:53:44,601
All right, I'm coming!

622
00:54:14,678 --> 00:54:15,838
What's wrong?

623
00:54:16,197 --> 00:54:17,478
They didn't come.

624
00:54:17,558 --> 00:54:18,398
Who?

625
00:54:19,158 --> 00:54:20,357
My friends.

626
00:54:21,357 --> 00:54:22,878
None of them are here.

627
00:54:31,277 --> 00:54:34,157
If they didn't come,
they're not your friends.

628
00:55:20,233 --> 00:55:21,473
Who's coming?

629
00:55:21,553 --> 00:55:23,593
Dizzy! Dizzy Gillespie!

630
00:55:23,672 --> 00:55:25,432
What kind of name is Dizzy?

631
00:55:25,633 --> 00:55:26,832
His name.

632
00:55:27,433 --> 00:55:29,992
You really expect me
to get this thing running?

633
00:55:30,111 --> 00:55:32,592
-You're the best.
-He's better than the best.

634
00:55:34,391 --> 00:55:35,712
I'm not this good.

635
00:55:37,192 --> 00:55:38,351
Bury it.

636
00:55:40,311 --> 00:55:42,191
That's the wrong size tire.

637
00:55:43,591 --> 00:55:44,950
It's round.

638
00:56:21,587 --> 00:56:22,827
How you doing?

639
00:56:22,907 --> 00:56:25,027
Welcome to Cuba, Mr. Gillespie.

640
00:56:25,147 --> 00:56:27,067
Welcome to the beautiful Havana.

641
00:56:27,146 --> 00:56:30,187
Mr. Gillespie, first thing we're gonna do,
we're gonna tour...

642
00:56:30,267 --> 00:56:33,106
...one of our internationally renowned
health care facilities.

643
00:56:33,226 --> 00:56:35,386
Thank you,
but my health don't need caring.

644
00:56:35,467 --> 00:56:37,386
Can you take me to Chano Pozo's crib?

645
00:56:37,426 --> 00:56:38,985
Chano Pozo's crib?

646
00:56:39,105 --> 00:56:41,425
You don't know who Chano is?

647
00:56:44,385 --> 00:56:45,865
I know who Chano is!

648
00:56:46,305 --> 00:56:48,144
This has nothing to do with you.

649
00:56:48,225 --> 00:56:49,945
No, hold on a second.

650
00:56:52,944 --> 00:56:54,744
Can you take me to his crib?

651
00:56:54,945 --> 00:56:55,984
His crib?

652
00:56:58,624 --> 00:57:00,024
Yes, of course.

653
00:57:00,184 --> 00:57:04,103
Mr. Gillespie, we have a tour. We have
the entire day planned out for you.

654
00:57:04,144 --> 00:57:05,944
That's okay, thank you very much.

655
00:57:06,144 --> 00:57:07,903
My boys'll go on the tour with you.

656
00:57:07,983 --> 00:57:09,822
Go with 'em, enjoy yourselves.

657
00:57:11,503 --> 00:57:12,983
It's a real honor.

658
00:57:14,062 --> 00:57:16,023
-What is this?
-It's my car.

659
00:57:18,222 --> 00:57:20,462
-Keep telling yourself that.
-Yes, sir.

660
00:57:21,342 --> 00:57:23,821
Watch yourself there. Okay, here we go.

661
00:57:28,142 --> 00:57:29,621
Okay, here we go.

662
00:57:29,901 --> 00:57:31,620
It's okay, thank you.

663
00:57:34,101 --> 00:57:36,381
You sure you know who Chano Pozo is?

664
00:57:36,820 --> 00:57:39,300
Mr. Gillespie, Luciano Pozo y González.

665
00:57:39,340 --> 00:57:43,180
Better known as "Chano."
Cuban conga player you met in 1946.

666
00:57:43,940 --> 00:57:46,739
Chano's from Belen,
which is just up the street here.

667
00:57:46,820 --> 00:57:51,299
Dizzy Gillespie and Chano Pozo added a
whole new polyrhythmic structure to jazz.

668
00:57:51,619 --> 00:57:53,899
You read the liner notes.

669
00:57:54,220 --> 00:57:58,179
-I've read everything to be read about--
-I gotta tell you something.

670
00:57:58,779 --> 00:58:00,660
Your car smells funny.

671
00:58:02,059 --> 00:58:03,338
Gasoline.

672
00:58:03,459 --> 00:58:04,739
Gasoline and tar.

673
00:58:05,019 --> 00:58:07,059
I painted it with gasoline and tar.

674
00:58:07,738 --> 00:58:09,339
Gasoline and tar?

675
00:58:09,419 --> 00:58:12,578
You're supposed to put the car on the road,
not the road on the car.

676
00:58:12,618 --> 00:58:14,538
Understand what I'm saying?

677
00:58:31,416 --> 00:58:32,936
Anti Imperialists

678
00:58:38,695 --> 00:58:40,336
REVOLUTION

679
00:59:00,734 --> 00:59:02,854
Is there a statue or something?

680
00:59:02,934 --> 00:59:05,093
Statue? No, there's no statue, Diz.

681
00:59:05,853 --> 00:59:07,893
Then take me to Chano Pozo Street.

682
00:59:07,974 --> 00:59:09,853
Street? No, there's no street.

683
00:59:10,733 --> 00:59:13,173
-What do they got?
-They don't got anything.

684
00:59:15,092 --> 00:59:16,892
How do people remember him?

685
00:59:17,453 --> 00:59:20,492
-Most people don't remember him.
-That's criminal, man.

686
00:59:20,931 --> 00:59:23,452
One of the greatest players
that ever played.

687
00:59:24,292 --> 00:59:29,092
Chano Pozo transcended the vicissitudes
of the contingent world...

688
00:59:29,171 --> 00:59:33,092
...and moved in an odyssey
into the realm of the metaphysical.

689
00:59:35,490 --> 00:59:38,610
I'll betcha Karl Marx got himself a statue.

690
00:59:39,371 --> 00:59:41,690
A statue and a theater, too.

691
00:59:41,930 --> 00:59:45,250
Karl Marx can kiss Chano Pozo's ass.

692
00:59:49,490 --> 00:59:51,809
You hear it? That's the sound, Diz.

693
00:59:52,169 --> 00:59:55,489
Chano Pozo learned how to play
the conga right in this neighborhood.

694
00:59:55,529 --> 00:59:57,408
What's this, a show or something?

695
00:59:57,608 --> 01:00:00,568
It's actually a party.
It's here every afternoon.

696
01:00:01,089 --> 01:00:02,848
We'll stop here.

697
01:00:03,648 --> 01:00:05,968
You can shoot as much as you want.

698
01:00:20,247 --> 01:00:22,487
This is Chano's world.
This is the real thing.

699
01:00:22,526 --> 01:00:24,565
They're doing a traditional yamboo.

700
01:00:25,526 --> 01:00:28,326
Dedicated to the city of Belen,
where Chano's from.

701
01:01:26,440 --> 01:01:28,400
You all kept it alive, man.

702
01:01:30,001 --> 01:01:33,040
When they dragged us over to America,
they took our drums...

703
01:01:33,121 --> 01:01:35,281
...our religion, our language.

704
01:01:35,880 --> 01:01:37,720
We had to learn theirs.

705
01:01:38,680 --> 01:01:42,240
But the true African heart's
still beating here in Cuba.

706
01:01:43,960 --> 01:01:45,640
I mean it is what it was.

707
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:48,999
There's more. A lot more.

708
01:01:49,599 --> 01:01:54,359
That reminds me, they're putting together
some sort of jam session for me tonight.

709
01:01:55,320 --> 01:01:58,838
You ever heard of this band called Irakere?

710
01:01:59,998 --> 01:02:01,199
Irakere?

711
01:02:04,438 --> 01:02:06,238
I heard of 'em.

712
01:02:14,037 --> 01:02:17,797
You're about to hear
the best musicians in Cuba.

713
01:02:18,556 --> 01:02:20,316
Like, Paquito D'Rivera.

714
01:02:29,915 --> 01:02:32,076
I like the sound of that.

715
01:02:49,354 --> 01:02:50,474
Gracias.

716
01:03:07,152 --> 01:03:09,712
What the hell's my driver
doing playing a trumpet?

717
01:03:10,192 --> 01:03:11,632
Your driver?

718
01:03:12,711 --> 01:03:14,032
Gimme my horn.

719
01:05:25,140 --> 01:05:27,181
The African and the Cuban...

720
01:05:27,621 --> 01:05:30,941
...transmogrified on
the great ethereal plane.

721
01:05:31,741 --> 01:05:34,300
I smuggled this thing in from Frankfurt.

722
01:05:34,460 --> 01:05:36,820
The government here,
they don't support jazz.

723
01:05:36,900 --> 01:05:41,019
As soon as you get on that boat tomorrow,
the so-called "Jazz Festival" is over.

724
01:05:41,699 --> 01:05:43,179
Musica non grata.

725
01:05:43,899 --> 01:05:45,739
Musica non grata.

726
01:05:46,739 --> 01:05:49,179
That show tonight was just for you.

727
01:05:49,419 --> 01:05:51,537
It's not like that every day.

728
01:05:52,579 --> 01:05:53,658
This your stuff?

729
01:05:55,698 --> 01:05:57,818
I didn't hear any of this tonight.

730
01:06:00,097 --> 01:06:01,777
Just some stuff I'm working on.

731
01:06:03,858 --> 01:06:06,017
That's nice.

732
01:06:06,816 --> 01:06:08,577
Musica non grata.

733
01:06:09,057 --> 01:06:10,176
You know...

734
01:06:11,296 --> 01:06:14,456
...Miles Davis came to me
for a trumpet lesson once.

735
01:06:14,496 --> 01:06:17,696
I said, "Let's go to the piano."
Miles looked at me:

736
01:06:18,096 --> 01:06:20,096
"I don't play no piano."

737
01:06:20,376 --> 01:06:25,015
I told him, "The only way you
can really get inside the music...

738
01:06:25,415 --> 01:06:28,816
"...arranging, composition,
is with the piano.

739
01:06:29,615 --> 01:06:33,054
"You learn it,
then we can better understand each other."

740
01:06:37,014 --> 01:06:39,414
Why don't you come on tour with me?

741
01:06:42,733 --> 01:06:44,332
Me, come with you?

742
01:06:44,613 --> 01:06:47,573
That horn I heard tonight
doesn't belong to you.

743
01:06:47,813 --> 01:06:49,973
It belongs to the whole world.

744
01:06:54,212 --> 01:06:55,773
Boat leaves mañana.

745
01:06:58,652 --> 01:06:59,851
Tomorrow?

746
01:07:02,132 --> 01:07:03,932
I wish, Diz. I wish.

747
01:07:05,612 --> 01:07:07,452
You don't understand.

748
01:07:07,492 --> 01:07:10,971
Dizzy Gillespie saw something in me.

749
01:07:12,491 --> 01:07:13,611
In me.

750
01:07:14,970 --> 01:07:17,410
So now you want to go away with him?

751
01:07:24,090 --> 01:07:26,489
I don't know what you want anymore.

752
01:07:26,610 --> 01:07:29,649
You are already in a band.
You tour, you're famous.

753
01:07:29,729 --> 01:07:32,409
I'm on display. I am in a cage.

754
01:07:33,729 --> 01:07:35,408
Don't be ridiculous.

755
01:07:35,488 --> 01:07:38,248
I'm in a sanctioned band,
playing sanctioned songs.

756
01:07:38,489 --> 01:07:41,368
We're going on tour next week
and I don't even feel like going.

757
01:07:41,448 --> 01:07:45,208
The music that I played tonight,
that's what I need to be playing.

758
01:07:45,968 --> 01:07:47,648
Don't you want that?

759
01:07:49,848 --> 01:07:51,287
Of course I do.

760
01:07:52,567 --> 01:07:55,167
You know that I've always supported you.

761
01:07:55,806 --> 01:07:57,286
We're a family.

762
01:07:59,127 --> 01:08:00,807
There are limits.

763
01:08:01,166 --> 01:08:02,286
Limits?

764
01:08:08,605 --> 01:08:10,566
Who am I talking to here?

765
01:08:11,126 --> 01:08:13,966
I don't see why you
have to complicate things.

766
01:08:28,284 --> 01:08:29,765
Look at this.

767
01:08:29,845 --> 01:08:33,004
Ten thousand Cubans have stormed
into the Peruvian embassy...

768
01:08:33,044 --> 01:08:35,564
...in a desperate attempt to flee the island.

769
01:08:35,604 --> 01:08:40,123
The Castro regime is waging a crackdown
on descent after a chaotic 48 hours...

770
01:08:40,485 --> 01:08:44,083
...that began when a Havana
bus driver seeking asylum...

771
01:08:44,163 --> 01:08:47,324
...for himself and his passengers,
crashed through the embassy gates...

772
01:08:47,403 --> 01:08:50,522
...prompting a cross fire
that left one guard dead.

773
01:08:51,123 --> 01:08:54,922
In retaliation for the embassy's refusal
to turn over the gate crashers...

774
01:08:54,962 --> 01:08:57,083
...the Cuban government
removed its guard...

775
01:08:57,203 --> 01:09:00,241
...triggering a stampede
of refuge-seeking Cubans.

776
01:09:02,002 --> 01:09:04,281
I left my sax on the plane.

777
01:09:04,681 --> 01:09:06,481
You forgot your sax?

778
01:09:07,082 --> 01:09:09,201
-Watch this for me, okay?
-Okay.

779
01:09:10,800 --> 01:09:13,281
Hurry up, the plane's gonna leave soon.

780
01:09:37,878 --> 01:09:39,518
Why did we cancel the tour?

781
01:09:39,599 --> 01:09:42,998
We canceled the tour to protect
Irakere's reputation and yours.

782
01:09:43,598 --> 01:09:48,317
This is Osvaldo, our compañero
from state security who attends to us.

783
01:09:49,518 --> 01:09:51,197
I'll call you later.

784
01:09:51,597 --> 01:09:52,837
Sit down.

785
01:09:56,397 --> 01:10:00,677
As I was saying, Irakere is a very important
voice of this revolution.

786
01:10:02,876 --> 01:10:05,836
-So is your voice.
-And so was Paquito's.

787
01:10:06,716 --> 01:10:08,356
And he betrayed us.

788
01:10:12,236 --> 01:10:14,115
And now, with Paquito gone...

789
01:10:14,714 --> 01:10:18,275
...we think you should play
a more prominent role in Irakere.

790
01:10:18,915 --> 01:10:21,594
You know I appreciate that, Jaime, but...

791
01:10:23,554 --> 01:10:25,474
...I got some other plans.

792
01:10:25,675 --> 01:10:27,594
You got some other plans?

793
01:10:29,593 --> 01:10:31,474
I want to start my own band.

794
01:10:31,754 --> 01:10:35,513
I want to do some fusion, I want to expand
the whole concept of Cuban music.

795
01:10:35,593 --> 01:10:37,953
I want to bring it to
a new international level.

796
01:10:38,473 --> 01:10:40,952
-Your own band?
-Yes, my own band.

797
01:10:44,992 --> 01:10:48,232
All right everybody ready at 5:00
for sound check.

798
01:10:49,432 --> 01:10:51,751
It's out of my hands. You can't play here.

799
01:10:51,912 --> 01:10:55,351
I have been to every club in this town.
I cannot get a gig.

800
01:10:57,312 --> 01:11:00,431
Word on the inside is you're
on the outside, that's what they say.

801
01:11:00,550 --> 01:11:03,111
Angel, this is your club, your rules.

802
01:11:03,511 --> 01:11:05,551
You love this music, but what?

803
01:11:07,631 --> 01:11:09,151
I'm your friend.

804
01:11:09,590 --> 01:11:13,670
It would make things a lot easier
if you just joined the Party.

805
01:11:14,389 --> 01:11:15,749
Very simple.

806
01:11:18,310 --> 01:11:19,349
What?

807
01:11:23,670 --> 01:11:24,829
Listen!

808
01:11:27,588 --> 01:11:30,109
You don't have to believe it, just sign.

809
01:11:30,148 --> 01:11:31,148
No.

810
01:11:31,748 --> 01:11:33,908
You wanna play the horn, right?

811
01:11:33,988 --> 01:11:35,907
You gotta play the game!

812
01:11:36,508 --> 01:11:38,267
Partner, you watching?

813
01:11:42,227 --> 01:11:44,788
Go sit down and play with your father.

814
01:11:46,427 --> 01:11:47,866
I can't. I gotta go.

815
01:11:49,026 --> 01:11:51,026
Why can't you stay longer?

816
01:11:56,707 --> 01:11:58,627
Marianela, let's go.

817
01:11:58,706 --> 01:11:59,826
Vámonos.

818
01:12:01,347 --> 01:12:03,146
You never want to play.

819
01:12:03,426 --> 01:12:06,226
-He never wants to play.
-Come on, play.

820
01:12:06,506 --> 01:12:08,865
-Sit down, you got time.
-Maybe you win.

821
01:12:09,425 --> 01:12:11,266
Marianela, let's go!

822
01:12:11,906 --> 01:12:13,225
I'm coming!

823
01:12:14,345 --> 01:12:17,026
Weren't you a friend of Paquito D'Rivera?

824
01:12:17,305 --> 01:12:20,944
-I'm still a friend.
-Really? Even after he defected?

825
01:12:21,025 --> 01:12:24,064
Paquito turned his back on our country.
To me, he's a traitor.

826
01:12:24,144 --> 01:12:25,423
He made a choice.

827
01:12:25,544 --> 01:12:27,944
He turned his back and he had it all.

828
01:12:28,304 --> 01:12:30,903
If he had it all, he wouldn't have left.

829
01:12:32,703 --> 01:12:34,943
-He's just another worm.
-A worm?

830
01:12:36,103 --> 01:12:39,423
Just like the 100,000 that are leaving
from the Port of Mariel by boats?

831
01:12:39,503 --> 01:12:43,542
-I guess they got tired of having it all, too.
-How can you say that?

832
01:12:44,222 --> 01:12:46,342
Are you listening to your son?

833
01:12:48,542 --> 01:12:50,102
I think we should play.

834
01:12:53,982 --> 01:12:55,422
It's my turn.

835
01:12:59,101 --> 01:13:01,021
Marianela, let's go!

836
01:13:13,339 --> 01:13:14,740
Talk to me.

837
01:13:15,260 --> 01:13:17,859
You lose your temper
every time we go there.

838
01:13:18,179 --> 01:13:21,099
You can't even sit down
and play dominoes with your father.

839
01:13:21,179 --> 01:13:23,419
-'Cause I can't watch it anymore.
-He likes to play.

840
01:13:23,498 --> 01:13:26,299
-What's wrong with that?
-He's throwing his life away.

841
01:13:26,419 --> 01:13:31,458
My father used to be a great mechanic,
and they came and took his garage away!

842
01:13:32,418 --> 01:13:34,658
Why do you think I bought that car?

843
01:13:34,737 --> 01:13:37,617
I bought it for him,
to get him away from that goddamn table!

844
01:13:37,697 --> 01:13:39,177
Keep your voice down.

845
01:13:39,257 --> 01:13:41,338
What are you afraid of? The revolution?

846
01:13:41,817 --> 01:13:44,456
Remember, it gives us everything.

847
01:13:44,617 --> 01:13:47,576
They didn't take your father's garage.
He gave it up.

848
01:13:47,697 --> 01:13:49,216
They nationalized it!

849
01:13:49,736 --> 01:13:52,376
They took away what he believed in!

850
01:13:52,456 --> 01:13:54,936
They took away his dream,
his love, his trade!

851
01:13:55,015 --> 01:13:56,337
The thing that he did!

852
01:13:56,376 --> 01:13:58,855
-We all make sacrifices.
-For what?

853
01:13:58,936 --> 01:14:02,176
For what? For the country! For an idea!

854
01:14:02,295 --> 01:14:04,815
-Free hospitals, free education.
-Of course.

855
01:14:05,015 --> 01:14:09,134
And by the way, those 100,000 people
running away at Mariel, they are giving up.

856
01:14:09,215 --> 01:14:10,335
-Giving up?
-Yes!

857
01:14:10,414 --> 01:14:12,694
That is exactly what they are not doing!

858
01:14:12,814 --> 01:14:17,654
By the way, what good is free education
if you can't read and say what you want?

859
01:14:17,814 --> 01:14:21,773
-What good are eyes if everybody's blind?
-I've never heard your father complain!

860
01:14:21,854 --> 01:14:23,294
-Not to you.
-Or you.

861
01:14:23,373 --> 01:14:27,212
-Your father supports this revolution.
-Because that's all he's got left!

862
01:14:27,333 --> 01:14:29,453
If he denounces it now,
what does he have?

863
01:14:29,533 --> 01:14:32,812
If he denounces Fidel,
his entire life would be meaningless!

864
01:14:32,852 --> 01:14:35,932
He would have given up
everything for a fucking lie!

865
01:14:36,332 --> 01:14:39,092
Turi is sleeping!
The whole neighborhood is sleeping!

866
01:14:39,133 --> 01:14:42,091
The whole country is sleeping!
My kids will have to wake up!

867
01:14:42,371 --> 01:14:44,491
My kids will not sleep through this!

868
01:14:45,252 --> 01:14:48,291
-Let's go, wake up, right now!
-They can hear you down the street.

869
01:14:48,411 --> 01:14:53,050
Let 'em report me to the committee
of the defense of the revolution!

870
01:14:53,490 --> 01:14:56,411
The Sandoval family
will not sleep through this!

871
01:14:56,850 --> 01:14:59,291
Are you listening?
Let's go, time to wake up!

872
01:15:00,770 --> 01:15:02,410
Nobody's sleeping in here!

873
01:15:02,609 --> 01:15:03,849
Let's go!

874
01:15:44,846 --> 01:15:47,607
-You gonna sleep all day?
-What do you want?

875
01:15:50,646 --> 01:15:51,806
You can play.

876
01:15:52,047 --> 01:15:55,766
Business has been bad,
and you bring in the customers, so--

877
01:15:55,845 --> 01:15:57,246
How many nights?

878
01:16:00,605 --> 01:16:02,405
We'll see how it goes.

879
01:16:10,005 --> 01:16:11,324
One, two.

880
01:16:11,684 --> 01:16:13,205
One, two, three, four.

881
01:16:23,283 --> 01:16:25,323
Okay? Like that. One, two.

882
01:16:25,843 --> 01:16:27,603
One, two, three, four.

883
01:16:37,801 --> 01:16:40,202
What's the matter,
you forget how to play the trumpet?

884
01:16:40,682 --> 01:16:42,881
No! Johnny!

885
01:16:43,401 --> 01:16:46,041
What happened?
They kick both of you out of London?

886
01:16:46,122 --> 01:16:48,480
-Hello, darling.
-Good to see you.

887
01:16:49,040 --> 01:16:52,121
You couldn't come to our club,
so we came to you.

888
01:16:53,241 --> 01:16:55,521
We had Dizzy back at the club last week.

889
01:16:56,121 --> 01:16:58,400
He couldn't stop talking about...

890
01:16:58,480 --> 01:17:00,560
...his Cuban compadre.

891
01:17:01,720 --> 01:17:03,680
He's an honorary Cuban now.

892
01:17:04,080 --> 01:17:06,400
He has a special respect for you.

893
01:17:07,360 --> 01:17:09,279
And he agrees with me.

894
01:17:10,359 --> 01:17:14,079
You gotta be somewhere
where your talents are truly respected.

895
01:17:27,758 --> 01:17:29,077
Not so loud.

896
01:17:29,478 --> 01:17:31,837
I just want to hear the end of it.

897
01:17:33,677 --> 01:17:35,556
Turi, off to bed. It's late.

898
01:17:36,756 --> 01:17:37,716
Sí.

899
01:17:37,877 --> 01:17:39,996
You should see this on Ochoa.

900
01:17:40,596 --> 01:17:41,756
Come.

901
01:17:44,276 --> 01:17:47,717
This is General Ochoa.

902
01:17:48,436 --> 01:17:52,755
Led the troops in Angola, Fidel proclaimed
him the hero of the revolution.

903
01:17:53,115 --> 01:17:54,835
Now he has him on trial.

904
01:17:54,915 --> 01:17:57,674
-What's his crime?
-He got too popular.

905
01:17:58,835 --> 01:18:02,594
You see, in Cuba there could only be
one hero of the revolution.

906
01:18:02,673 --> 01:18:06,673
Unless, you're dead and then
you can be as popular as you want.

907
01:18:07,073 --> 01:18:09,554
Don't let Arturo brainwash you.

908
01:18:09,794 --> 01:18:12,353
Ochoa is only accused of drug trafficking.

909
01:18:12,433 --> 01:18:16,793
Mari's the only person in the country who
believes he did it without Fidel's blessing.

910
01:18:16,953 --> 01:18:20,512
I don't even think he did it
and I'm not the only one.

911
01:18:21,153 --> 01:18:24,312
We have a judicial process here.
He will be exonerated.

912
01:18:24,473 --> 01:18:26,072
-Exonerated?
-It's a fair trial.

913
01:18:26,113 --> 01:18:30,912
You've been watching this trial for a week
and it's not a fair trial, it's a farce!

914
01:18:31,071 --> 01:18:33,512
He will end up in the firing squad.

915
01:18:35,191 --> 01:18:38,910
-He will never execute Ochoa.
-It's already been fixed.

916
01:18:39,190 --> 01:18:42,151
His lawyer has begged
the judge to execute him.

917
01:18:42,431 --> 01:18:47,150
His defense attorney has turned into
his prosecutor. You call that a fair trial?

918
01:18:55,430 --> 01:18:56,951
I'm so sorry.

919
01:18:58,471 --> 01:19:00,950
I just wanted tonight to be perfect.

920
01:19:01,870 --> 01:19:03,070
Darling.

921
01:19:03,709 --> 01:19:06,229
I've never had a dinner party
without a fight.

922
01:19:06,308 --> 01:19:08,389
Usually, I'm the one who starts them.

923
01:19:08,470 --> 01:19:11,469
I don't know what he wants. He's so...

924
01:19:12,389 --> 01:19:13,509
...unhappy.

925
01:19:18,428 --> 01:19:21,508
Of course he is, he's a musician.

926
01:19:22,749 --> 01:19:25,707
I've been around them for 40 years.

927
01:19:26,747 --> 01:19:30,787
You know, in all that time I've never seen
another one like Arturo.

928
01:19:33,347 --> 01:19:36,747
I'd like to dedicate this show tonight
to my main man...

929
01:19:37,707 --> 01:19:40,307
...my inspiration, Mr. Dizzy Gillespie.

930
01:19:41,266 --> 01:19:45,146
I'd like to play a tune entitled,
Blues for Diz.

931
01:20:45,300 --> 01:20:46,860
Sorry, I'm late.

932
01:20:48,900 --> 01:20:50,419
This is Paloma.

933
01:21:19,338 --> 01:21:21,857
-I'm glad you could come.
-I wouldn't miss it.

934
01:21:21,937 --> 01:21:24,457
Johnny and Sally, our friends from London.

935
01:21:31,856 --> 01:21:34,176
Mari, you have to know something.

936
01:21:35,456 --> 01:21:37,136
People are watching.

937
01:21:40,016 --> 01:21:43,015
There have been reports about him,
about both of you.

938
01:21:43,094 --> 01:21:44,696
What are you talking about?

939
01:21:45,975 --> 01:21:50,055
They're gonna shut him down.
They won't let him play after tonight.

940
01:22:23,412 --> 01:22:25,252
Great show.

941
01:22:26,773 --> 01:22:31,131
You know that if it was up to me,
you could play here every night.

942
01:22:32,652 --> 01:22:34,052
You know that.

943
01:22:39,691 --> 01:22:41,370
You were wonderful.

944
01:22:43,531 --> 01:22:44,690
Wait.

945
01:23:26,567 --> 01:23:30,527
Why do you think the Cuban government
is so afraid of your music?

946
01:23:35,846 --> 01:23:39,165
They're not afraid of my music,
they're afraid of ideas.

947
01:23:39,285 --> 01:23:42,366
Come on,
Fidel Castro is afraid of your ideas?

948
01:23:42,445 --> 01:23:45,565
Fidel Castro is afraid
of any idea that's not his.

949
01:23:46,525 --> 01:23:50,124
-You know how he overthrew Batista?
-It was a popular revolution.

950
01:23:50,204 --> 01:23:52,805
It was a popular idea, it was a great idea.

951
01:23:52,884 --> 01:23:55,323
He promised Cuban people
what they were desperate for:

952
01:23:55,364 --> 01:23:59,163
Restoration of a constitution, democracy,
freedom from a dictatorship.

953
01:23:59,283 --> 01:24:01,524
He did it with 80 people and 50 guns.

954
01:24:01,603 --> 01:24:04,123
And a boat that nearly sank
because of a running toilet.

955
01:24:04,203 --> 01:24:05,683
That can't be all they had.

956
01:24:05,763 --> 01:24:09,923
That's all he needed because the idea
gave him the strength of an army.

957
01:24:12,683 --> 01:24:17,162
The reason I've come here is
to see if maybe I could talk about Arturo.

958
01:24:18,162 --> 01:24:20,521
So he could be allowed to play his music.

959
01:24:20,801 --> 01:24:23,362
It's not entirely an issue of music.

960
01:24:25,121 --> 01:24:28,281
-I'm sorry?
-And it isn't entirely about Arturo.

961
01:24:29,201 --> 01:24:32,520
You were also seen entertaining
foreigners in your home.

962
01:24:32,600 --> 01:24:34,840
Are you questioning my loyalty?

963
01:24:35,960 --> 01:24:39,520
There is a pattern
of counter-revolutionary behavior.

964
01:24:41,080 --> 01:24:44,880
With all due respect,
what revolution are you talking about?

965
01:24:45,239 --> 01:24:47,759
-Is there some confusion?
-Apparently.

966
01:24:48,479 --> 01:24:51,999
My revolution doesn't sound
anything like your revolution.

967
01:24:52,678 --> 01:24:55,559
Mine is not about informing
on your neighbors.

968
01:24:55,678 --> 01:24:58,038
It's about creating a new society.

969
01:24:58,878 --> 01:25:01,278
Genuine equality, remember?

970
01:25:02,558 --> 01:25:05,078
A place where our children can thrive.

971
01:25:05,598 --> 01:25:09,878
I'm sure you will agree that no country
loves its children more than Cuba.

972
01:25:09,958 --> 01:25:11,477
Until they grow up.

973
01:25:11,517 --> 01:25:12,677
Compañera.

974
01:25:13,717 --> 01:25:18,476
I know you love your husband, but
don't say something you may regret later.

975
01:25:19,356 --> 01:25:22,476
The revolution needs
everyone's support to survive.

976
01:25:24,435 --> 01:25:26,355
Excuse me for saying this...

977
01:25:26,996 --> 01:25:29,475
...but if the revolution can't survive...

978
01:25:29,555 --> 01:25:33,515
...two people from England
having dinner at my house...

979
01:25:34,515 --> 01:25:37,395
...or a Cuban man playing
the music he loves...

980
01:25:38,355 --> 01:25:40,594
...why bother trying to save it?

981
01:25:52,235 --> 01:25:54,314
They're showing this all day long.

982
01:25:54,634 --> 01:25:57,234
-What's the verdict?
-What do you think?

983
01:25:58,234 --> 01:25:59,914
He already shot him.

984
01:26:10,233 --> 01:26:11,473
Where did he go?

985
01:26:11,712 --> 01:26:13,393
AT ANY COST

986
01:26:36,790 --> 01:26:40,190
Were you there that day when
Fidel marched into Havana?

987
01:26:48,309 --> 01:26:49,628
I was there.

988
01:26:52,948 --> 01:26:54,389
I was a child.

989
01:26:58,268 --> 01:27:00,829
And I saw him riding in that jeep.

990
01:27:02,507 --> 01:27:04,467
That beard, that smile.

991
01:27:08,307 --> 01:27:09,947
He was like a saint.

992
01:27:18,746 --> 01:27:20,426
And I fell in love.

993
01:27:24,386 --> 01:27:27,826
I fell in love with Fidel,
I fell in love with his dream.

994
01:27:36,584 --> 01:27:38,625
It was going to be paradise.

995
01:27:42,385 --> 01:27:43,824
I didn't know.

996
01:27:45,104 --> 01:27:48,904
I didn't know they would stop you
from playing your music.

997
01:27:51,823 --> 01:27:53,703
My wife got her heart broken.

998
01:27:54,383 --> 01:27:57,903
It's like finding out that your lover
had been cheating on you all this time.

999
01:27:58,983 --> 01:28:00,863
And it was over for her.

1000
01:28:02,262 --> 01:28:04,102
Just so I understand...

1001
01:28:04,463 --> 01:28:08,702
...what you're saying is you never
sympathized with the Castro regime.

1002
01:28:10,462 --> 01:28:14,742
Please, I mean no disrespect,
take a piece of pencil and write this down.

1003
01:28:14,821 --> 01:28:18,780
I have never ever,
sympathized with Fidel Castro.

1004
01:28:18,861 --> 01:28:21,861
He betrayed the idea,
he broke every promise he ever made.

1005
01:28:21,901 --> 01:28:24,020
Please, just write that down.

1006
01:28:30,820 --> 01:28:34,739
This is from The London Tlmes
earlier this year.

1007
01:28:35,499 --> 01:28:40,139
You're quoted as making favorable
statements about the Castro regime.

1008
01:28:42,979 --> 01:28:46,539
This is from a German newspaper,
Frankfurt, I think.

1009
01:28:47,858 --> 01:28:50,939
"The revolution gave me
everything I needed."

1010
01:28:51,818 --> 01:28:53,737
Is that an accurate quote?

1011
01:28:54,258 --> 01:28:57,418
I said it in Frankfurt,
in Stockholm and in Havana.

1012
01:28:57,497 --> 01:29:00,456
I had to say what I had to say.
I had to play the game.

1013
01:29:00,537 --> 01:29:02,857
You have to understand how that looks.

1014
01:29:03,217 --> 01:29:05,256
You come in here with an American icon--

1015
01:29:05,336 --> 01:29:08,616
Everyone in Havana,
every single person in Havana...

1016
01:29:08,777 --> 01:29:11,455
...has to have a double-face
in order to survive!

1017
01:29:11,536 --> 01:29:14,376
You must understand,
you have to play the game.

1018
01:29:14,496 --> 01:29:18,656
I plead with you.
My wife and my son are waiting for me.

1019
01:29:18,937 --> 01:29:21,056
My son is in London waiting for me!

1020
01:29:21,136 --> 01:29:25,056
This was intercepted by the U.S. Interest
Section in Havana six months ago.

1021
01:29:25,575 --> 01:29:27,936
It confirms your membership
in the Communist Party...

1022
01:29:27,976 --> 01:29:30,176
...and your acceptance of all its principles.

1023
01:29:31,215 --> 01:29:32,775
Are you a member?

1024
01:29:37,175 --> 01:29:39,694
Are you a member
of the Communist Party?

1025
01:30:24,650 --> 01:30:25,851
Thank you.

1026
01:30:35,129 --> 01:30:38,929
If you enjoy my music and the way I play...

1027
01:30:41,008 --> 01:30:44,249
...it's because the revolution
has given me the opportunity.

1028
01:30:47,969 --> 01:30:49,808
Thank you and goodnight.

1029
01:31:12,005 --> 01:31:13,846
It's not gonna work out.

1030
01:31:13,887 --> 01:31:16,565
Yes, we're so close, don't say that.

1031
01:31:18,845 --> 01:31:20,925
-He won't go for it.
-He will.

1032
01:31:22,165 --> 01:31:26,564
Just do what you have been doing.
Give the government credit for everything.

1033
01:31:28,124 --> 01:31:30,165
Even the air that I breathe.

1034
01:31:31,484 --> 01:31:33,523
A personal gift from Fidel.

1035
01:31:38,004 --> 01:31:40,843
I thought you only got nervous
for auditions.

1036
01:31:44,082 --> 01:31:46,003
What do you think this is?

1037
01:31:54,442 --> 01:31:57,122
Mi socio,
all the bookings have been arranged.

1038
01:31:57,442 --> 01:31:58,842
Have a good trip.

1039
01:31:59,041 --> 01:32:01,521
Be careful with the women over there.

1040
01:32:03,601 --> 01:32:05,041
I need a favor.

1041
01:32:06,002 --> 01:32:07,281
A favor?

1042
01:32:08,841 --> 01:32:11,640
I was hoping that my family
can join me on this tour.

1043
01:32:11,761 --> 01:32:15,840
I've been on tour three times this year.
It's too much time away.

1044
01:32:20,520 --> 01:32:22,479
Let me be honest with you.

1045
01:32:22,720 --> 01:32:24,520
It's the United Nation band.

1046
01:32:24,599 --> 01:32:28,080
Paquito, Ignacio, two defectors.

1047
01:32:28,199 --> 01:32:31,959
We're concerned that you're going to be
playing with two counter-revolutionaries.

1048
01:32:32,319 --> 01:32:34,278
It's not gonna be a problem.

1049
01:32:35,038 --> 01:32:37,037
-Are you sure?
-No problem.

1050
01:32:38,158 --> 01:32:40,558
Are you willing to denounce Paquito?

1051
01:32:55,677 --> 01:32:56,517
No.

1052
01:32:57,357 --> 01:33:01,877
If a foreign reporter asks you how you feel
about Paquito, what would you say?

1053
01:33:05,917 --> 01:33:09,477
I would say we share the same stage
but not the same views.

1054
01:33:11,476 --> 01:33:12,516
Good.

1055
01:33:12,596 --> 01:33:16,476
Had you denounced him, I would've known
there was something wrong.

1056
01:33:16,995 --> 01:33:18,475
Come over here.

1057
01:33:20,196 --> 01:33:22,875
I'll see what I can do.
I'm going to try my best.

1058
01:33:22,995 --> 01:33:24,515
Okay, my friend?

1059
01:33:26,834 --> 01:33:30,394
We can't tell anybody about our plans,
not even our parents.

1060
01:33:30,514 --> 01:33:32,154
It's for their own protection.

1061
01:33:32,234 --> 01:33:34,473
When I leave,
it has to be like any other trip.

1062
01:33:34,554 --> 01:33:36,914
No crying, no problem.
We just leave, okay?

1063
01:33:36,953 --> 01:33:41,073
You can't pack too much
because you'll call attention to yourself.

1064
01:33:41,154 --> 01:33:45,673
But I've got to bring so many things.
I have to pack for you, Leonel and Turi.

1065
01:33:45,993 --> 01:33:48,273
Thank God Emilia gave me that suitcase.

1066
01:33:51,232 --> 01:33:53,512
They didn't authorize Leonel's visa.

1067
01:33:53,872 --> 01:33:55,791
He's of military age.

1068
01:33:57,472 --> 01:33:59,311
But we got permission.

1069
01:34:00,112 --> 01:34:03,351
-You said we got permission.
-We did, but not Leonel.

1070
01:34:05,831 --> 01:34:07,151
I just found out.

1071
01:34:07,232 --> 01:34:09,831
He's my son,
they have to let him go with us.

1072
01:34:09,951 --> 01:34:12,630
He is forbidden to travel, no exceptions.

1073
01:34:14,430 --> 01:34:17,710
-We can't leave him behind.
-We'll find a way to bring him.

1074
01:34:17,791 --> 01:34:18,790
How?

1075
01:34:19,150 --> 01:34:22,630
Paquito was going to bring his family
and they're still here.

1076
01:34:23,390 --> 01:34:25,269
We said we'd go as a family.

1077
01:34:25,350 --> 01:34:29,069
I swear to you, I tried,
but there's no exceptions.

1078
01:34:30,189 --> 01:34:32,268
He's on call for seven years.

1079
01:34:33,349 --> 01:34:36,388
Seven years.
We will wait, that's not so long.

1080
01:34:36,508 --> 01:34:39,749
Turi's gonna be military age,
that's another seven years.

1081
01:34:39,788 --> 01:34:42,947
If we don't go now,
none of us will ever get out.

1082
01:34:47,467 --> 01:34:49,667
You want me to leave my son?

1083
01:34:49,707 --> 01:34:51,747
He's my son too, you know.

1084
01:34:52,067 --> 01:34:54,467
Then how could you think
about leaving him?

1085
01:34:54,547 --> 01:34:55,747
You go.

1086
01:34:59,546 --> 01:35:00,946
Listen to me.

1087
01:35:01,066 --> 01:35:04,065
You know I'm not gonna go
without you, anywhere.

1088
01:35:04,906 --> 01:35:07,785
-I won't leave my boy.
-He's not a boy anymore.

1089
01:35:07,866 --> 01:35:09,345
He's my son.

1090
01:35:11,025 --> 01:35:12,185
Listen to me.

1091
01:35:12,265 --> 01:35:14,865
No matter how long it takes...

1092
01:35:14,985 --> 01:35:16,944
...even if I have to take a boat back...

1093
01:35:17,104 --> 01:35:20,184
...I will get Leonel
and bring him back to us, I promise you.

1094
01:35:20,264 --> 01:35:22,944
He will be with us. We have to be strong.

1095
01:35:23,064 --> 01:35:25,544
Look at me! We have to be strong.

1096
01:35:26,024 --> 01:35:30,383
We have to make the first move or else
we're never gonna get our family out.

1097
01:35:30,984 --> 01:35:33,223
Come on, trust me. Come here.

1098
01:35:41,902 --> 01:35:44,062
-Let me help you with that.
-I got it.

1099
01:35:44,222 --> 01:35:46,622
-Come on, it's my job now.
-I got it.

1100
01:35:49,102 --> 01:35:51,141
-Nice taxi, doctor.
-Thank you.

1101
01:35:51,261 --> 01:35:53,781
I have realized my full potential.

1102
01:35:54,301 --> 01:35:56,980
-I wanna go with you, Papi.
-I know, Turi.

1103
01:35:58,620 --> 01:36:01,500
I'm gonna see you in London
in two weeks, okay?

1104
01:36:01,860 --> 01:36:03,700
You take care of Mommy.

1105
01:36:09,060 --> 01:36:10,820
Take care of yourself.

1106
01:36:12,579 --> 01:36:13,900
Be careful.

1107
01:36:23,019 --> 01:36:24,299
Thank you.

1108
01:36:24,579 --> 01:36:25,900
For what?

1109
01:36:26,019 --> 01:36:28,499
For teaching me how to play dominoes.

1110
01:36:29,139 --> 01:36:31,459
You still got a lot more to learn.

1111
01:36:39,778 --> 01:36:42,537
Take good care of the car. Don't bury it.

1112
01:36:47,777 --> 01:36:49,337
I'll see you soon.

1113
01:36:49,817 --> 01:36:51,138
I'm scared.

1114
01:36:53,457 --> 01:36:54,656
Trust me.

1115
01:36:57,496 --> 01:37:00,577
Take care of Mommy, okay?
And bring her to London.

1116
01:37:00,656 --> 01:37:02,656
We'll be there in two weeks.

1117
01:37:23,095 --> 01:37:25,653
I don't want to make a scene
in front of my mother...

1118
01:37:25,853 --> 01:37:28,893
...but I don't want to pretend
like I respect you.

1119
01:37:32,893 --> 01:37:35,293
You don't have all the information.

1120
01:37:35,933 --> 01:37:38,612
I used to think that you were something.

1121
01:37:40,412 --> 01:37:42,573
The way you never backed down.

1122
01:37:43,292 --> 01:37:45,611
You're just like the rest of 'em.

1123
01:37:46,051 --> 01:37:48,212
I'm so sorry you feel that way.

1124
01:37:48,292 --> 01:37:49,412
Sorry?

1125
01:37:50,971 --> 01:37:53,812
Don't feel sorry for me, be sorry for Turi.

1126
01:37:53,851 --> 01:37:57,130
Because all you ever do
is teach him how to sell out.

1127
01:38:51,446 --> 01:38:53,365
You're still not packed?

1128
01:38:54,966 --> 01:38:56,606
I don't know, Papi.

1129
01:38:58,445 --> 01:39:00,364
I don't know what I will need.

1130
01:39:03,445 --> 01:39:05,444
I saw your Mommy last night.

1131
01:39:07,605 --> 01:39:10,124
No, in a dream. Papá no está loco.

1132
01:39:11,284 --> 01:39:14,124
-How is she?
-She's worried, mi niña.

1133
01:39:14,324 --> 01:39:17,324
She said to me, "Sosa,
our daughter is leaving...

1134
01:39:17,964 --> 01:39:21,443
"...and you must do everything
in your power to help her."

1135
01:39:28,043 --> 01:39:30,083
Mi niña, mi amor.

1136
01:39:31,802 --> 01:39:33,243
Quite a dream.

1137
01:39:37,082 --> 01:39:38,362
I tried....

1138
01:39:39,282 --> 01:39:41,401
-I tried to tell you--
-Don't.

1139
01:39:46,962 --> 01:39:48,842
In my old age...

1140
01:39:49,842 --> 01:39:54,841
...nothing will give me greater peace
than to know that you are safe.

1141
01:39:56,001 --> 01:39:57,601
And happy.

1142
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,480
Mi cielo, wherever you are...

1143
01:40:05,080 --> 01:40:07,279
...we'll always be together.

1144
01:40:09,679 --> 01:40:11,119
Come here.

1145
01:40:38,398 --> 01:40:40,076
You know I love you.

1146
01:40:43,796 --> 01:40:45,316
I love you, too.

1147
01:40:47,317 --> 01:40:49,476
Don't worry, I'll take care of him.

1148
01:40:49,556 --> 01:40:51,916
It's only gonna be a month, okay?

1149
01:40:55,155 --> 01:40:56,675
Take care of yourself.

1150
01:41:21,233 --> 01:41:25,713
You make a very compelling case.

1151
01:41:27,432 --> 01:41:31,712
But I have to be honest with you.
I don't think this is going to be easy.

1152
01:41:32,632 --> 01:41:35,992
-Maybe I could try to explain better.
-You did explain to me.

1153
01:41:36,552 --> 01:41:39,832
But this application is going
to be reviewed in D.C.

1154
01:41:40,312 --> 01:41:43,591
On paper it appears that
you benefited from the system...

1155
01:41:43,751 --> 01:41:46,311
...and that your motives are financial.

1156
01:41:46,831 --> 01:41:47,950
That's just not true.

1157
01:41:48,031 --> 01:41:52,270
The burden of proof is on you,
you see and on paper--

1158
01:41:52,591 --> 01:41:54,989
-Change the paper.
-Excuse me?

1159
01:41:55,751 --> 01:41:58,430
You tell'em. Please.

1160
01:41:59,109 --> 01:42:03,629
I will make my recommendations.
I will start the process, but--

1161
01:42:03,749 --> 01:42:05,469
How long is the process?

1162
01:42:05,590 --> 01:42:06,949
It's hard to tell.

1163
01:42:07,229 --> 01:42:10,108
It could be a week, a month.

1164
01:42:10,949 --> 01:42:13,228
There's no way of knowing.

1165
01:42:14,148 --> 01:42:16,028
What am I supposed to do?

1166
01:42:18,947 --> 01:42:22,468
Do you realize how hard it was
to get my family out of Cuba?

1167
01:42:24,027 --> 01:42:26,627
Do you know how long we've planned this?

1168
01:42:28,707 --> 01:42:30,626
We are completely exposed.

1169
01:42:30,987 --> 01:42:33,107
You must find a way of protecting us.

1170
01:42:33,187 --> 01:42:37,106
The law states you must be in immediate
and observable danger--

1171
01:42:37,186 --> 01:42:39,426
They shot two defectors
in London two months--

1172
01:42:39,506 --> 01:42:41,345
I can't offer official protection.

1173
01:42:41,386 --> 01:42:43,146
You must understand.

1174
01:42:43,746 --> 01:42:45,985
My wife and son are by themselves.

1175
01:42:47,826 --> 01:42:48,985
Listen to me.

1176
01:42:49,545 --> 01:42:51,744
No one will know you were here.

1177
01:42:51,825 --> 01:42:55,345
You just continue the tour
as if nothing happened.

1178
01:42:57,544 --> 01:42:59,864
-I can't go back.
-It's not up to me.

1179
01:43:02,784 --> 01:43:04,944
There's nothing else I can do.

1180
01:43:06,384 --> 01:43:09,224
I'll tell Mr. Gillespie that you're waiting.

1181
01:43:18,303 --> 01:43:21,464
-What am I supposed to do?
-Just do what the man says.

1182
01:43:22,183 --> 01:43:25,903
Go on the tour and be cool, baby,
we'll work it out.

1183
01:43:40,981 --> 01:43:43,061
We gotta go, come on.

1184
01:43:47,141 --> 01:43:49,060
Hold on!

1185
01:43:55,060 --> 01:43:56,141
Damnit!

1186
01:43:56,740 --> 01:43:58,140
They hung up.

1187
01:43:59,059 --> 01:44:01,460
Listen, I've been through this, okay?

1188
01:44:01,620 --> 01:44:04,739
Ten feet, but you're not gonna
get there if you don't move.

1189
01:44:05,339 --> 01:44:08,219
We intercepted this
from the U.S. Interest Section.

1190
01:44:14,938 --> 01:44:16,578
Arturo Sandoval.

1191
01:44:20,298 --> 01:44:21,617
What's this?

1192
01:44:35,257 --> 01:44:37,735
Johnny, line two, It's Havana.

1193
01:44:41,335 --> 01:44:42,496
Hello?

1194
01:44:44,455 --> 01:44:45,496
What?

1195
01:44:52,535 --> 01:44:55,495
Something's up.
They know Marianela's in London.

1196
01:44:55,895 --> 01:44:58,374
-They're asking questions.
-Slow down.

1197
01:44:58,453 --> 01:45:02,174
Listen to me, they're gonna find out
and take her back to Cuba.

1198
01:45:02,293 --> 01:45:04,213
That ain't gonna happen.

1199
01:45:04,454 --> 01:45:07,253
I gotta go now, man,
I gotta defect right now.

1200
01:45:07,853 --> 01:45:09,133
Take it easy.

1201
01:45:10,014 --> 01:45:12,373
One in there from the White House.

1202
01:45:13,812 --> 01:45:17,773
-You gonna call the President?
-Vice President, met him on Air Force One.

1203
01:45:17,852 --> 01:45:20,812
The cat said if I need anything,
give him a call.

1204
01:45:24,371 --> 01:45:27,652
Play the gig tonight,
and then you'll be on the plane.

1205
01:45:36,851 --> 01:45:38,051
Wait for me!

1206
01:45:38,131 --> 01:45:42,291
If you get through to the embassy,
tell them it won't take us too long.

1207
01:46:25,886 --> 01:46:27,846
-You're Mrs. Sandoval?
-Yes.

1208
01:46:28,086 --> 01:46:29,487
Come with me, quickly.

1209
01:46:40,046 --> 01:46:42,284
These are your documents, all in order.

1210
01:46:42,365 --> 01:46:45,165
When you get to New York
just stay on the plane.

1211
01:46:45,246 --> 01:46:48,405
This man from the State Department
will meet you on the plane.

1212
01:46:48,485 --> 01:46:51,166
Do not get off the plane with anybody else.

1213
01:46:51,645 --> 01:46:53,445
What about my husband?

1214
01:46:53,765 --> 01:46:56,485
I'm sorry, we haven't heard anything yet.

1215
01:48:06,718 --> 01:48:09,118
You really don't know
what this is all about.

1216
01:48:10,198 --> 01:48:11,398
They defected?

1217
01:48:22,037 --> 01:48:24,436
It's up to you to bring
them home where they belong.

1218
01:48:27,156 --> 01:48:31,356
There's nothing that I can say
that could ever bring them back.

1219
01:49:04,267 --> 01:49:07,591
Mr. Sandoval,
please, come with us.

1220
01:49:44,496 --> 01:49:46,528
Pappy!
