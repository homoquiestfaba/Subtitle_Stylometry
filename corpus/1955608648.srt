1
00:00:46,221 --> 00:00:48,460
<i>I used to want to
save the world.</i>

2
00:00:50,361 --> 00:00:52,228
<i>This beautiful place.</i>

3
00:00:54,139 --> 00:00:56,059
<i>But I knew so little then.</i>

4
00:00:58,369 --> 00:01:00,655
<i>It is a land of
magic and wonder.</i>

5
00:01:01,725 --> 00:01:04,219
<i>Worth cherishing in every way.</i>

6
00:01:07,078 --> 00:01:08,824
<i>But the closer you get...</i>

7
00:01:10,122 --> 00:01:13,618
<i>the more you see the great
darkness shimmering within.</i>

8
00:01:17,832 --> 00:01:19,274
<i>And mankind?</i>

9
00:01:21,727 --> 00:01:24,363
<i>Mankind is another
story altogether.</i>

10
00:01:26,463 --> 00:01:31,533
<i>What one does when faced with the truth..
Is more difficult than you think.</i>

11
00:01:41,847 --> 00:01:43,579
<i>I learned this the hard way.</i>

12
00:01:44,917 --> 00:01:46,668
<i>A long long time ago.</i>

13
00:01:49,592 --> 00:01:50,593
<i>And now...</i>

14
00:01:53,426 --> 00:01:55,094
<i>I will never be the same.</i>

15
00:02:02,725 --> 00:02:04,228
Yeah.. Si.

18
00:02:50,148 --> 00:02:51,562
Hello, Diana.

19
00:02:51,785 --> 00:02:53,493
<i>- Hello, Diana.
- Hello.</i>

20
00:02:54,518 --> 00:02:55,389
<i>Diana!</i>

21
00:02:56,749 --> 00:02:57,825
Diana!

22
00:02:58,436 --> 00:02:59,437
Come back!

23
00:03:39,577 --> 00:03:40,830
- Looks very good.
- Very good.

24
00:03:41,031 --> 00:03:41,880
How is she?

25
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:43,175
She's good.

26
00:03:43,576 --> 00:03:44,684
- Keep working.
- I will.

27
00:03:46,641 --> 00:03:47,714
Niobi.

28
00:04:09,521 --> 00:04:10,326
Diana!

29
00:04:12,032 --> 00:04:13,434
Diana, I see you.

30
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,926
Where are you going? Slow down!

31
00:04:33,033 --> 00:04:34,034
Hello mother.

32
00:04:34,779 --> 00:04:36,136
How are you today?

33
00:04:37,737 --> 00:04:40,256
Let's get you back to school,
before another tutor quits.

34
00:04:40,557 --> 00:04:43,843
But don't you think it's
time to start my training?

35
00:04:44,495 --> 00:04:46,302
Antiope thinks I'm ready.

36
00:04:47,067 --> 00:04:48,368
Does she?

37
00:04:49,248 --> 00:04:51,571
I could begin showing
her some things.

38
00:04:53,554 --> 00:04:55,537
She should at least be
able to defend herself.

39
00:04:55,876 --> 00:04:56,877
From whom?

40
00:04:57,132 --> 00:04:58,959
In the event of an invasion.

41
00:04:59,169 --> 00:05:02,461
Isn't that why I have the greatest
warrior in our history...

42
00:05:02,503 --> 00:05:04,964
leading an entire army, General?

43
00:05:06,254 --> 00:05:09,129
I pray there will never
come when she has to fight.

44
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:12,404
But you know, a
scorpion must sting...

45
00:05:12,405 --> 00:05:15,088
- A wolf must hunt.
- She is a child.

46
00:05:15,089 --> 00:05:17,677
The only child on the island.
Please let her be so.

47
00:05:17,722 --> 00:05:18,723
But, mother...

48
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:20,121
There will be no training.

49
00:05:27,887 --> 00:05:29,369
What if I promise to be careful?

50
00:05:30,606 --> 00:05:32,201
It's time to sleep.

51
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:36,198
What if I didn't use a sword?

52
00:05:36,938 --> 00:05:39,100
Fighting does not
make you a hero.

53
00:05:39,465 --> 00:05:42,025
Just the shield then,
no sharp edges.

54
00:05:42,859 --> 00:05:46,296
Diana, you are the most precious
thing in the world to me.

55
00:05:47,507 --> 00:05:51,190
I wished for you so much, so I
sculpted you from clay myself.

56
00:05:51,465 --> 00:05:53,956
And begged Zeus
to give you life.

57
00:05:54,201 --> 00:05:55,790
You've told me this story.

58
00:05:56,487 --> 00:05:59,906
Which is why.. tonight
I'll tell you a new one.

59
00:06:00,606 --> 00:06:03,718
The story of our people
and my days of battle.

60
00:06:03,957 --> 00:06:04,778
Yes!

61
00:06:04,952 --> 00:06:08,992
So you will finally understand
why war is nothing to hope for.

62
00:06:14,937 --> 00:06:17,567
<i>Long ago, when time was new...</i>

63
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:21,197
<i>and all of history
was still a dream...</i>

64
00:06:21,409 --> 00:06:23,700
<i>the gods ruled the earth.</i>

65
00:06:23,966 --> 00:06:26,534
<i>Zeus king among them.</i>

66
00:06:29,178 --> 00:06:32,309
<i>Zeus created beings over
which the Gods would rule.</i>

67
00:06:32,904 --> 00:06:35,357
<i>Beings born in his image...</i>

68
00:06:35,612 --> 00:06:39,219
<i>fair and good,
strong and passionate.</i>

69
00:06:39,851 --> 00:06:44,050
<i>He called his creation "Man".
And mankind was good.</i>

70
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:48,256
<i>But Zeus' son.. grew
envious of mankind...</i>

71
00:06:48,557 --> 00:06:51,623
<i>and sought to corrupt
his father's creation.</i>

72
00:06:52,631 --> 00:06:56,098
<i>This was Ares, the God of War.</i>

73
00:06:58,305 --> 00:07:02,469
<i>Ares poisoned men's hearts
with jealousy and suspicion.</i>

74
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:04,763
<i>He turned them against
one another...</i>

75
00:07:04,988 --> 00:07:07,958
<i>and war ravaged the Earth.</i>

76
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:13,074
<i>So, the gods created
us, the Amazons...</i>

77
00:07:13,075 --> 00:07:15,723
<i>to influence men's
hearts with love...</i>

78
00:07:15,999 --> 00:07:18,422
<i>and restore peace to the Earth.</i>

79
00:07:21,324 --> 00:07:24,547
<i>And for a brief time,
there was peace.</i>

80
00:07:30,565 --> 00:07:31,871
<i>But it did not last.</i>

81
00:07:38,659 --> 00:07:42,365
<i>Your mother, The Amazon
Queen, led a revolt...</i>

82
00:07:42,606 --> 00:07:45,468
<i>that freed us all
from enslavement.</i>

83
00:07:52,435 --> 00:07:55,766
<i>When Zeus led the gods
to our defence...</i>

84
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:59,099
<i>Ares killed them one by one...</i>

85
00:07:59,311 --> 00:08:02,455
<i>until only Zeus
himself remained.</i>

86
00:08:03,809 --> 00:08:08,244
<i>Zeus used the last of his
power to stop Ares...</i>

87
00:08:09,137 --> 00:08:13,789
<i>striking such a blow, the god
of war was forced to retreat.</i>

88
00:08:15,147 --> 00:08:16,186
<i>But Zeus knew...</i>

89
00:08:16,461 --> 00:08:20,525
<i>that one day Ares might
return to finish his mission.</i>

90
00:08:21,149 --> 00:08:22,461
<i>An endless war...</i>

91
00:08:23,091 --> 00:08:26,050
<i>where mankind would finally
destroy themselves...</i>

92
00:08:26,527 --> 00:08:29,618
<i>and us with them.</i>

93
00:08:29,749 --> 00:08:32,320
<i>So Zeus, left us a weapon.</i>

94
00:08:32,321 --> 00:08:35,619
<i>One powerful
enough to kill a god.</i>

95
00:08:36,831 --> 00:08:40,839
<i>With his dying breath, Zeus
created this island...</i>

96
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:43,013
<i>to hide us from the
outside world...</i>

97
00:08:43,413 --> 00:08:45,636
<i>Somewhere Ares
could not find us.</i>

98
00:08:49,981 --> 00:08:52,417
<i>And all has been
quiet ever since.</i>

99
00:09:00,175 --> 00:09:04,275
We give thanks to the gods
for giving us this paradise.

100
00:09:06,259 --> 00:09:07,703
And the God Killer?

101
00:09:12,475 --> 00:09:13,506
The God Killer?

102
00:09:13,807 --> 00:09:16,222
The weapon that is strong
enough to kill a God.

103
00:09:17,263 --> 00:09:18,546
Can I see it?

104
00:09:28,515 --> 00:09:30,536
The Gods gave us many gifts.

105
00:09:31,178 --> 00:09:32,737
One day, you'll know them all.

106
00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:36,252
This great tower.. is
where we keep them.

107
00:09:48,806 --> 00:09:49,914
The God Killer.

108
00:09:53,659 --> 00:09:55,161
It's beautiful.

109
00:09:56,908 --> 00:09:58,119
Who would wield it?

110
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:03,273
I pray it will never
be called to arms.

111
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:06,963
But only the fiercest
among us even could.

112
00:10:07,228 --> 00:10:09,375
And that's not you, Diana.

113
00:10:10,231 --> 00:10:12,578
You see? You are safe...

114
00:10:13,096 --> 00:10:16,000
and there is nothing you
should concern yourself with.

115
00:10:29,376 --> 00:10:30,973
You keep doubting
yourself, Diana.

116
00:10:31,186 --> 00:10:33,402
- No, I don't.
- Yes. You do.

117
00:10:34,057 --> 00:10:35,058
No, I don't.

118
00:10:39,714 --> 00:10:43,743
You Arestronger than you believe. You
have greater powers than you know.

119
00:10:44,068 --> 00:10:46,053
- But if you don't try harder...
- Diana!

120
00:10:57,895 --> 00:10:58,896
Are you hurt?

121
00:10:59,211 --> 00:11:00,405
No, Mother, I'm fine.

122
00:11:00,605 --> 00:11:02,299
- I was just...
- Training.

123
00:11:03,731 --> 00:11:06,221
Seems I'm not the revered
queen I should be.

124
00:11:06,323 --> 00:11:08,741
Disobeyed, betrayed
by my own sister...

125
00:11:09,242 --> 00:11:11,092
No, mother. It was me.
I asked her...

126
00:11:11,313 --> 00:11:12,354
Take her to the palace.

127
00:11:14,641 --> 00:11:15,642
Off you go.

128
00:11:23,907 --> 00:11:26,007
You left me no
choice, Hippolyta.

129
00:11:27,701 --> 00:11:30,343
You neglect your duty,
if she cannot fight.

130
00:11:30,658 --> 00:11:32,680
You speak of a time
that may never come.

131
00:11:34,581 --> 00:11:38,786
He might never return. He could
have died from his wounds.

132
00:11:38,811 --> 00:11:41,698
Ares is alive.

133
00:11:42,175 --> 00:11:45,403
You feel it as I
do, in your bones.

134
00:11:45,921 --> 00:11:48,482
It is only a matter of
time before he returns.

135
00:11:52,499 --> 00:11:56,284
The stronger she gets, the
sooner he will find her.

136
00:11:56,508 --> 00:11:59,173
Hippolyta, I love her as you do.

137
00:12:00,748 --> 00:12:03,719
But this is the only way
to truly protect her.

138
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:18,116
You will train her harder
than any Amazon before her.

139
00:12:18,962 --> 00:12:20,529
Five times harder...

140
00:12:20,908 --> 00:12:22,911
ten times harder.

141
00:12:23,211 --> 00:12:26,014
Until she's better
than even you.

142
00:12:26,571 --> 00:12:28,417
But she must never
know the truth...

143
00:12:28,668 --> 00:12:30,074
about what she is...

144
00:12:30,819 --> 00:12:32,822
or how she came to be.

145
00:13:27,277 --> 00:13:28,478
Harder.

146
00:13:28,495 --> 00:13:30,636
You are stronger
than this, Diana.

147
00:13:31,502 --> 00:13:32,678
Again.

148
00:13:50,117 --> 00:13:51,507
Never let your guard down.

149
00:13:52,462 --> 00:13:54,344
You expect the
battle to be fair.

150
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,106
A battle will never be fair.

151
00:14:10,125 --> 00:14:11,126
Anti­ope!

152
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,041
Lay still..

153
00:14:14,267 --> 00:14:15,568
You're bleeding.

154
00:14:16,546 --> 00:14:19,070
- I'm sorry...
- Wait, Diana.

155
00:14:25,291 --> 00:14:26,543
What had I done?

156
00:14:28,484 --> 00:14:29,817
I'm sorry.

157
00:17:01,278 --> 00:17:03,088
Where did this fog come from?

158
00:17:06,871 --> 00:17:09,709
There... Go forward.

159
00:17:26,541 --> 00:17:27,542
<i>There he is!</i>

160
00:17:27,565 --> 00:17:29,274
<i>- The pilot! I can see him.
- He's there!</i>

161
00:18:00,993 --> 00:18:02,294
Wow.

162
00:18:05,095 --> 00:18:06,602
You are a man.

163
00:18:10,916 --> 00:18:13,819
Yeah. I mean...

164
00:18:15,796 --> 00:18:17,509
Do I not look like one?

165
00:18:21,893 --> 00:18:23,245
Where are we?

166
00:18:23,652 --> 00:18:25,237
Temiscira.

167
00:18:25,353 --> 00:18:26,369
What?

168
00:18:26,888 --> 00:18:27,944
Who are you?

169
00:18:36,077 --> 00:18:38,934
I'm one of the good guys and
those are the bad guys.

170
00:18:39,139 --> 00:18:40,140
What?

171
00:18:40,385 --> 00:18:42,096
The German. Come on, we
need to get out of here.

172
00:18:42,297 --> 00:18:44,043
- The Germans?
- Diana!

173
00:18:44,904 --> 00:18:46,809
Step away from her.. now!

174
00:18:49,189 --> 00:18:50,890
Ready your bows!

175
00:18:53,965 --> 00:18:55,303
They have guns. Right?

176
00:18:58,188 --> 00:18:59,189
Fire!

177
00:19:00,528 --> 00:19:01,529
Come on!

178
00:20:39,352 --> 00:20:40,353
Stay down!

179
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,063
Shield!

180
00:21:40,743 --> 00:21:41,826
No!

181
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:43,934
No!

182
00:21:49,702 --> 00:21:50,703
No.

183
00:21:51,111 --> 00:21:54,713
No. No.. Antiope.

184
00:21:54,873 --> 00:21:57,466
Anti­ope, hey.

185
00:22:01,288 --> 00:22:02,311
Diana.

186
00:22:04,295 --> 00:22:05,997
- The time has come.
- No.

187
00:22:06,895 --> 00:22:08,936
You... you must...

188
00:22:09,085 --> 00:22:12,232
What? What, Anti­ope?

189
00:22:16,195 --> 00:22:17,469
God Killer!

190
00:22:18,262 --> 00:22:20,199
- Diana, go...
- Go where?

191
00:22:20,966 --> 00:22:22,187
- Where?
- Go...

192
00:22:22,212 --> 00:22:26,616
No, please no. No, no!

193
00:22:28,311 --> 00:22:30,002
- No!
- Anti­ope!

194
00:22:31,954 --> 00:22:32,967
No!

195
00:22:40,139 --> 00:22:41,817
- You.
- No..

196
00:22:43,193 --> 00:22:44,247
No mother no.

197
00:22:44,272 --> 00:22:45,790
He fought at my side
against the invaders.

198
00:22:45,891 --> 00:22:48,227
What man fights against
his own people?

199
00:22:48,253 --> 00:22:49,145
These aren't my people.

200
00:22:49,170 --> 00:22:51,480
Then, why do you
wear their colors?

201
00:22:53,599 --> 00:22:54,538
I can't tell you that.

202
00:22:54,563 --> 00:22:55,915
You need to tell us now!

203
00:22:56,015 --> 00:22:56,906
What's your name?

204
00:22:58,382 --> 00:22:59,668
I can't tell you that either.

205
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:03,516
We should kill him now
and be done with it.

206
00:23:03,541 --> 00:23:04,843
If he dies...

207
00:23:05,202 --> 00:23:09,393
we know nothing about who
they are and why they came.

208
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:18,397
My...

209
00:23:20,541 --> 00:23:24,577
Name is Captain Steve Trevor, pilot,
American Expeditionary Forces.

210
00:23:24,602 --> 00:23:27,965
Serial number 8141921.

211
00:23:35,128 --> 00:23:36,927
Assigned to British
Intelligence.

212
00:23:38,783 --> 00:23:40,438
What the hell is this thing?

213
00:23:40,463 --> 00:23:43,440
The lasso of Hestia compels
you to reveal the truth.

214
00:23:43,918 --> 00:23:45,337
But it's really hot.

215
00:23:45,662 --> 00:23:48,343
It is pointless and
painful to resist.

216
00:23:49,431 --> 00:23:50,689
What is your mission?

217
00:23:50,926 --> 00:23:54,552
Whoever you are, you are in
more danger than you think.

218
00:23:54,652 --> 00:23:56,092
What is your mission?

219
00:23:59,221 --> 00:24:00,222
I am a...

220
00:24:04,909 --> 00:24:05,921
I am a...

221
00:24:09,429 --> 00:24:10,932
I'm a spy.

222
00:24:14,017 --> 00:24:16,376
I'm a spy. I'm a spy.

223
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:20,590
<i>British Intelligence got word...</i>

224
00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:23,385
<i>that the leader of the German Army Gen.
Ludendorff.</i>

225
00:24:23,612 --> 00:24:27,435
<i>would be visiting a secret military
installation in the Ottoman empire.</i>

226
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:30,534
<i>I posed as one of their
pilots and flew in with them.</i>

227
00:24:30,612 --> 00:24:34,353
<i>According to our Intel, the
Germans had no troops left...</i>

228
00:24:34,378 --> 00:24:37,198
<i>no money, no
munitions of any kind.</i>

229
00:24:37,707 --> 00:24:41,962
<i>But our Intel was wrong. The German
had the Turks building bombs for 'em.</i>

230
00:24:41,987 --> 00:24:44,305
<i>And not just bombs, new weapons.</i>

231
00:24:44,330 --> 00:24:45,914
<i>Secret weapons.</i>

232
00:24:47,409 --> 00:24:52,657
<i>Invented by Ludendorff's Chief
psychopath, Dr.. Isabelle Maru.</i>

233
00:24:54,028 --> 00:24:56,994
<i>The boys in the trenches
called her "Doctor Poison".</i>

234
00:24:57,834 --> 00:24:59,406
<i>And for good reason.</i>

235
00:25:28,028 --> 00:25:31,997
<i>From what I could tell if Dr. Maru
was able to complete her work,</i>

236
00:25:32,117 --> 00:25:35,418
<i>millions more would die.
The war would never end.</i>

237
00:25:35,443 --> 00:25:37,580
<i>I was there to observe and
report, nothing more...</i>

238
00:25:37,605 --> 00:25:40,826
<i>but, I had to do something.</i>

239
00:25:50,684 --> 00:25:52,565
Which is.. I need more time.

240
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:54,337
Unfortunately, Dr.. we
don't have more time.

241
00:25:54,338 --> 00:25:56,827
This work, this...

242
00:26:02,523 --> 00:26:04,080
Get that man!

243
00:26:04,105 --> 00:26:05,169
Now!

244
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:01,908
But if I can get these notes back to
the British Intelligence in time...

245
00:27:03,067 --> 00:27:05,727
it could stop millions
more from dying.

246
00:27:05,927 --> 00:27:08,119
It could stop the war.

247
00:27:08,719 --> 00:27:10,415
War? What war?

248
00:27:12,687 --> 00:27:14,120
The War.

249
00:27:17,237 --> 00:27:19,493
The war to end the all wars.

250
00:27:20,897 --> 00:27:22,402
Four years...

251
00:27:23,512 --> 00:27:27,271
27 countries... 25 million dead.

252
00:27:27,889 --> 00:27:29,591
Soldiers and civilians.

253
00:27:30,491 --> 00:27:32,149
Innocent people...

254
00:27:32,829 --> 00:27:35,063
Women and children slaughtered.

255
00:27:36,266 --> 00:27:39,650
Their homes and their
villages looted & burned.

256
00:27:44,706 --> 00:27:46,893
Weapons far deadlier
than you can...

257
00:27:49,441 --> 00:27:50,834
ever imagine.

258
00:27:55,361 --> 00:27:57,308
It's like nothing
I've ever seen.

259
00:27:58,339 --> 00:28:00,446
It's like the world's gonna end.

260
00:28:02,305 --> 00:28:03,565
Should we let him go?

261
00:28:04,076 --> 00:28:06,669
And risk him bringing
more men to our shores?

262
00:28:06,694 --> 00:28:08,742
We can not hold him
forever, my queen.

263
00:28:08,767 --> 00:28:10,714
Mother, excuse me...

264
00:28:10,739 --> 00:28:14,997
but after everything the
man said, this must be Ares.

265
00:28:15,022 --> 00:28:16,320
What are you talking
about, child?

266
00:28:16,321 --> 00:28:19,792
Forgive me, Senator, but the man
called it a war without end.

267
00:28:20,485 --> 00:28:22,540
Millions of people already dead.

268
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:25,181
Like nothing he's ever seen.

269
00:28:25,268 --> 00:28:27,120
Only Ares could do such a thing.

270
00:28:29,328 --> 00:28:32,414
We can not simply let him go.
We must go with him.

271
00:28:33,187 --> 00:28:35,945
I will not deploy our army and
leave them scare defences...

272
00:28:36,045 --> 00:28:36,804
to go and fight their war.

273
00:28:36,805 --> 00:28:38,724
It's not their war.

274
00:28:38,749 --> 00:28:41,978
Zeus created man to be just, and
wise, strong and passionate...

275
00:28:42,003 --> 00:28:44,394
That was a story, Diana!

276
00:28:44,519 --> 00:28:46,080
This much, you do
not understand?

277
00:28:46,081 --> 00:28:47,082
Men are easily corrupted.

278
00:28:47,453 --> 00:28:49,617
Yes, but Ares is behind
that corruption!

279
00:28:50,379 --> 00:28:53,429
It is Ares who has these
Germans fighting..

280
00:28:53,707 --> 00:28:57,201
And stopping the God of war
is our fore ordinance.

281
00:28:57,526 --> 00:29:00,110
As Amazons this is our duty.

282
00:29:00,183 --> 00:29:03,566
But you're not an Amazon
like the rest of us.

283
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:05,502
So you will do nothing.

284
00:29:06,229 --> 00:29:07,670
As your queen I forbid it.

285
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:21,956
Strange.

286
00:29:23,589 --> 00:29:25,477
Is it true you saved his life?

287
00:29:25,997 --> 00:29:27,184
Who told you that?

288
00:29:27,533 --> 00:29:28,534
He did.

289
00:29:54,404 --> 00:29:56,027
Ah.. I didn't see you come in.

290
00:30:02,005 --> 00:30:04,888
Would you say you are a...

291
00:30:05,850 --> 00:30:08,549
a typical example of your sex?

292
00:30:08,951 --> 00:30:11,070
I am...

293
00:30:13,659 --> 00:30:15,335
above average.

294
00:30:19,211 --> 00:30:20,308
What's that?

295
00:30:22,142 --> 00:30:23,608
It's a...

296
00:30:25,715 --> 00:30:26,716
Oh...

297
00:30:29,598 --> 00:30:30,599
It's a watch.

298
00:30:31,421 --> 00:30:32,422
A watch?

299
00:30:32,473 --> 00:30:33,794
Yeah, it's a watch.

300
00:30:33,822 --> 00:30:35,429
Tells time.

301
00:30:35,829 --> 00:30:37,967
My father gave it to me.

302
00:30:39,769 --> 00:30:41,161
Went through hell
'n back with him.

303
00:30:42,603 --> 00:30:45,525
Now it's for me and, good
thing it's still ticking..

304
00:30:46,627 --> 00:30:47,647
What for?

305
00:30:49,577 --> 00:30:51,189
Because it tells time.

306
00:30:52,583 --> 00:30:55,069
When to eat, sleep,
wake up, work...

307
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:59,569
You let this little thing
tell you what to do?

308
00:31:00,011 --> 00:31:01,335
Yeah...

309
00:31:07,710 --> 00:31:09,241
Can I ask you some questions?

310
00:31:10,654 --> 00:31:12,484
- Where are we?
- Temiscira.

311
00:31:12,578 --> 00:31:16,265
No, I got that before, but I mean..
Where are we?

312
00:31:17,176 --> 00:31:19,161
What is this place?
Who are you people?

313
00:31:19,261 --> 00:31:21,469
Why does the water do that?

314
00:31:21,569 --> 00:31:23,931
How come you don't know what a watch is?
How can you speak English so well?

315
00:31:24,131 --> 00:31:25,904
We speak hundreds of languages.

316
00:31:26,625 --> 00:31:30,169
We are the bridge to a greater
understanding between all men.

317
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,623
Right.

318
00:31:36,957 --> 00:31:39,804
You know, I didn't get a
chance to say this...

319
00:31:41,446 --> 00:31:45,466
earlier, but thank you for
dragging me out of the water.

320
00:31:46,891 --> 00:31:48,276
Thank you...

321
00:31:49,016 --> 00:31:51,205
for what you did on the beach.

322
00:31:59,181 --> 00:32:00,182
So...

323
00:32:01,553 --> 00:32:03,003
you are here to let me go?

324
00:32:04,267 --> 00:32:07,871
I tried, but it's not up to me.

325
00:32:08,584 --> 00:32:10,257
I even asked them to
send me with you..

326
00:32:12,898 --> 00:32:14,249
Or anyone.

327
00:32:14,607 --> 00:32:15,611
In Amazon..

328
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,662
The Amazons.

329
00:32:17,715 --> 00:32:18,872
The Amazons?

330
00:32:19,127 --> 00:32:21,773
It is our sacred duty
to defend the world.

331
00:32:22,869 --> 00:32:24,655
And I wish to go..

332
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:29,484
But my mother will not allow it.

333
00:32:31,957 --> 00:32:32,958
Well...

334
00:32:34,810 --> 00:32:35,846
I can't say I blame her.

335
00:32:36,859 --> 00:32:38,048
The way this war's going...

336
00:32:38,049 --> 00:32:40,549
I don't wanna let
anyone I care about near.

337
00:32:40,574 --> 00:32:43,010
Then why do you want to go back?

338
00:32:43,035 --> 00:32:45,657
I don't think "want"
is the word, right?

339
00:32:47,558 --> 00:32:50,012
I guess I gotta try.

340
00:32:51,635 --> 00:32:54,615
My father told me
once he said...

341
00:32:54,715 --> 00:32:56,488
"If you see something wrong
happening in the world...

342
00:32:56,708 --> 00:32:59,311
"you can either do nothing,
or you can do something."

343
00:33:01,113 --> 00:33:02,985
And I already tried nothing.

344
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:43,145
Nice outfit.

345
00:35:44,103 --> 00:35:45,018
Oh, thank you.

346
00:35:45,935 --> 00:35:48,867
Now.. I'll show you the
way off the Island...

347
00:35:49,633 --> 00:35:51,197
and you'll take me to Ares.

348
00:35:52,297 --> 00:35:53,298
Deal.

349
00:36:02,163 --> 00:36:03,481
I am leaving on that?

350
00:36:03,665 --> 00:36:04,988
We are..

351
00:36:06,352 --> 00:36:08,359
Yeah, we're leaving in that?

352
00:36:08,559 --> 00:36:09,961
Do you not know how to sail?

353
00:36:10,344 --> 00:36:11,420
Of course I know how to sail.

354
00:36:11,448 --> 00:36:13,410
Why wouldn't I know how to sail?
It's just...

355
00:36:14,328 --> 00:36:15,880
It's been a while.

356
00:36:45,012 --> 00:36:46,477
I am going, mother.

357
00:36:47,369 --> 00:36:50,474
I cannot stand by while
innocent lives are lost.

358
00:36:51,551 --> 00:36:55,863
If no one else will defend the
world from Ares, then I must.

359
00:36:57,465 --> 00:36:58,894
I have to go.

360
00:36:59,271 --> 00:37:00,393
I know.

361
00:37:01,646 --> 00:37:04,170
Or at least I know I
can not stop you.

362
00:37:09,774 --> 00:37:11,495
There is so much...

363
00:37:12,456 --> 00:37:13,572
So much you do not understand.

364
00:37:13,573 --> 00:37:14,794
I understand enough.

365
00:37:15,606 --> 00:37:19,141
But I'm willing to fight for those
who cannot fight for themselves.

366
00:37:21,961 --> 00:37:23,422
Like you once did.

367
00:37:23,924 --> 00:37:26,030
You know that if you
choose to leave...

368
00:37:27,650 --> 00:37:29,248
you may never return.

369
00:37:30,836 --> 00:37:33,020
Who will I be if I stay?

370
00:37:41,669 --> 00:37:44,949
This belonged to the greatest
warrior in our history...

371
00:37:45,262 --> 00:37:47,449
our beloved Anti­ope.

372
00:37:47,610 --> 00:37:49,983
Make sure you're worthy of it.

373
00:37:51,582 --> 00:37:53,143
I will.

374
00:37:56,285 --> 00:37:58,614
Be careful in the
world of men, Diana.

375
00:38:00,350 --> 00:38:02,724
They do not deserve you.

376
00:38:07,167 --> 00:38:10,111
You have been my greatest love.

377
00:38:14,043 --> 00:38:15,556
Today...

378
00:38:17,479 --> 00:38:20,237
you are my greatest sorrow.

379
00:38:58,355 --> 00:39:00,008
Should you have told her?

380
00:39:00,411 --> 00:39:05,224
The more she knows, the
sooner he will find her.

381
00:39:16,690 --> 00:39:18,582
How long until we reach the war?

382
00:39:19,672 --> 00:39:21,917
The war, which part?

383
00:39:21,991 --> 00:39:23,753
The Western Front
in France is...

384
00:39:23,762 --> 00:39:26,156
400 miles long, from the
Alps to the North Sea.

385
00:39:27,456 --> 00:39:29,697
Where the fighting is
the most intense then.

386
00:39:29,721 --> 00:39:32,751
If you take me there, I'm
sure I'll find Ares.

387
00:39:36,476 --> 00:39:38,707
Ares as in.. the God of War?

388
00:39:38,772 --> 00:39:42,808
The God of war is our responsibility.
Only an Amazon can defeat him.

389
00:39:43,758 --> 00:39:45,720
With this.

390
00:39:47,045 --> 00:39:48,475
And once I do...

391
00:39:48,814 --> 00:39:50,636
the war will end.

392
00:39:57,447 --> 00:39:59,924
Look. I appreciate
your spirit...

393
00:40:00,316 --> 00:40:01,863
but this war is...

394
00:40:01,917 --> 00:40:04,875
It's a great big mess.

395
00:40:05,499 --> 00:40:08,274
And there's not a whole lot
you and I can do about that.

396
00:40:08,307 --> 00:40:11,142
I mean, we can get back to London
and try to look for men who can.

397
00:40:11,236 --> 00:40:13,221
I'm the man who can!

398
00:40:13,246 --> 00:40:15,441
Once I find and destroy Ares...

399
00:40:15,543 --> 00:40:18,318
the German armies will be
freed from his influence...

400
00:40:18,418 --> 00:40:20,904
they will good men again
and the world will be better.

401
00:40:25,534 --> 00:40:26,535
Great.

402
00:40:27,221 --> 00:40:28,272
You will see.

403
00:40:31,858 --> 00:40:32,659
What are you doing?

404
00:40:34,119 --> 00:40:35,803
I thought maybe you wanna...

405
00:40:36,857 --> 00:40:38,007
get some sleep.

406
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,878
What about you? Are
you not sleeping?

407
00:40:44,145 --> 00:40:45,971
Does the average men not sleep?

408
00:40:50,195 --> 00:40:53,018
Yes, we sleep. We just
don't sleep with a...

409
00:40:53,355 --> 00:40:54,305
You don't sleep with women?

410
00:40:54,631 --> 00:40:57,368
No, I mean, I do, I sleep with...
I sleep with...

411
00:40:58,805 --> 00:41:00,161
Yes, I do..

412
00:41:00,186 --> 00:41:01,798
But out of the...

413
00:41:02,797 --> 00:41:05,912
confines of marriage.

414
00:41:09,496 --> 00:41:11,471
Not polite to assume, you know?

415
00:41:15,501 --> 00:41:16,819
"Marriage"?

416
00:41:16,820 --> 00:41:18,704
Weird! You don't have that...

417
00:41:20,031 --> 00:41:21,353
You go before a judge...

418
00:41:21,678 --> 00:41:26,160
and you swear to love, honor
and cherish each other...

419
00:41:26,185 --> 00:41:27,362
Until death do you apart.

420
00:41:27,963 --> 00:41:30,184
And do they.. love
each other till death?

421
00:41:30,466 --> 00:41:32,301
Not very often, no.

422
00:41:32,326 --> 00:41:33,753
Then why do they do it?

423
00:41:33,778 --> 00:41:36,359
I have no idea.

424
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:40,186
So you cannot sleep with
me unless I marry you..

425
00:41:40,386 --> 00:41:42,013
I will sleep with you if you want.
I'll sleep right there.

426
00:41:42,038 --> 00:41:43,113
There is plenty of room.

427
00:41:43,439 --> 00:41:45,705
- Then fine, if you don't mind...
- No, it's up to you.

428
00:41:45,733 --> 00:41:48,540
- I'm just fine.
- Coming to sleep with you.

429
00:41:48,629 --> 00:41:49,750
Okay.

430
00:42:11,333 --> 00:42:15,955
You know, where I come from,
I'm not considered average.

431
00:42:16,770 --> 00:42:19,311
You know, um.. being a spy...

432
00:42:19,609 --> 00:42:22,684
You have to show a
certain amount of...

433
00:42:24,334 --> 00:42:25,533
vigor.

434
00:42:28,871 --> 00:42:32,200
Have you never met a man before?
What about your father?

435
00:42:32,442 --> 00:42:34,049
I have no father.

436
00:42:34,768 --> 00:42:36,344
My mother sculpted
me from clay...

437
00:42:36,569 --> 00:42:38,760
and I was brought
to life by Zeus.

438
00:42:41,889 --> 00:42:43,184
Well that's neat.

439
00:42:46,896 --> 00:42:47,897
Sorry.

440
00:42:50,783 --> 00:42:52,389
Where I come from..

441
00:42:53,827 --> 00:42:56,003
Babies are made differently.

442
00:42:57,061 --> 00:42:58,900
You refer to
reproductive biology.

443
00:42:58,925 --> 00:43:00,618
- Yes, yes.
- Yeah, I know.

444
00:43:01,487 --> 00:43:02,931
I know all about that.

445
00:43:03,187 --> 00:43:06,018
I mean I refer to that
and other things.

446
00:43:06,949 --> 00:43:08,247
The pleasures of the flesh.

447
00:43:10,852 --> 00:43:12,700
Do you know about that?

448
00:43:14,310 --> 00:43:17,988
I've read all 12 volumes of Clio's
criticism on earthly pleasures

449
00:43:20,052 --> 00:43:21,053
12 huh?

450
00:43:26,161 --> 00:43:27,690
Did you bring any
of those with you?

451
00:43:28,205 --> 00:43:29,460
You would not enjoy them.

452
00:43:29,461 --> 00:43:30,895
I don't know. May be.

453
00:43:31,111 --> 00:43:32,116
No you wouldn't.

454
00:43:32,381 --> 00:43:33,382
Why not?

455
00:43:33,923 --> 00:43:37,022
They came to the conclusion that man
are essential for procreation...

456
00:43:37,062 --> 00:43:39,047
but when it comes to pleasure...

457
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:41,245
Unnecessary.

458
00:43:41,415 --> 00:43:42,416
No.

459
00:43:47,726 --> 00:43:48,727
Goodnight.

460
00:44:02,846 --> 00:44:04,246
How long until
we're operational?

461
00:44:04,547 --> 00:44:05,868
Two days, sir.

462
00:44:05,869 --> 00:44:07,751
We'll have it up
tonight, Captain.

463
00:44:07,986 --> 00:44:12,096
Sir, the men have had
no food, no sleep.

464
00:44:12,097 --> 00:44:14,258
Do you think I have had a
neat food or rest, captain?

465
00:44:14,870 --> 00:44:16,737
Do you hear me making excuses?

466
00:44:16,837 --> 00:44:17,493
No.

467
00:44:17,693 --> 00:44:19,436
Your men, they are
weak, complacent.

468
00:44:19,636 --> 00:44:22,081
You've let them forget for an
attack can happen at any time.

469
00:44:22,311 --> 00:44:23,614
From any cover!

470
00:44:23,885 --> 00:44:25,166
So let's you & I remind them...

471
00:44:25,553 --> 00:44:26,354
Shall we?

472
00:44:41,112 --> 00:44:42,808
- Doctor.
- General.

473
00:44:43,038 --> 00:44:44,039
Progress?

474
00:44:44,161 --> 00:44:45,468
Not enough.

475
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:48,111
It is over, General.

476
00:44:48,452 --> 00:44:50,196
Germany is giving up.

477
00:44:50,387 --> 00:44:54,290
Von Hindenburg has recommended
the Kaiser sign the armistice.

478
00:44:54,613 --> 00:44:56,580
We have run out of time.

479
00:44:58,223 --> 00:45:00,935
As soon as the Kaiser
sees the newest weapon...

480
00:45:01,184 --> 00:45:02,907
he will not sign the armistice.

481
00:45:02,908 --> 00:45:04,095
But without my notebook...

482
00:45:04,310 --> 00:45:05,680
We will get your book!

483
00:45:05,681 --> 00:45:08,192
It is you that I
believe in, not it.

484
00:45:09,616 --> 00:45:12,672
I know what you can
and will succeed...

485
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:17,749
It is what you're put
on this earth to do.

486
00:45:21,396 --> 00:45:24,730
Something, did come
to me last night.

487
00:45:25,231 --> 00:45:26,955
A different type of gas.

488
00:45:28,186 --> 00:45:29,090
For you.

489
00:45:29,597 --> 00:45:31,541
To restore your strength.

490
00:46:01,654 --> 00:46:04,317
I have got it! I have got it!

491
00:46:04,606 --> 00:46:07,570
And if it's what I think...

492
00:46:08,872 --> 00:46:10,737
It's going to be...

493
00:46:12,279 --> 00:46:13,754
terrible.

494
00:46:35,247 --> 00:46:36,321
Morning!

495
00:46:36,714 --> 00:46:39,411
We got lucky. We caught a
ride, we make some good time.

496
00:46:39,812 --> 00:46:42,097
Welcome to Jolly old London!

497
00:46:42,383 --> 00:46:44,025
It's hideous..

498
00:46:44,234 --> 00:46:46,038
Yeah, it's not for everybody.

499
00:47:08,045 --> 00:47:09,662
- Good morning Darling.
- What a babe.

500
00:47:09,915 --> 00:47:10,916
Oh no!

501
00:47:10,937 --> 00:47:13,406
Gentlemen, eyes to yourself.
Thank you so much.

502
00:47:15,372 --> 00:47:17,231
Come on!

503
00:47:18,815 --> 00:47:20,348
Why are they holding hands?

504
00:47:21,288 --> 00:47:23,471
Probably because
they're together.

505
00:47:26,271 --> 00:47:28,857
No... No.. We're not together,
I mean, in that way.

506
00:47:29,142 --> 00:47:30,143
This way.

507
00:47:30,243 --> 00:47:31,244
To the war!

508
00:47:31,485 --> 00:47:34,087
Well, technically, the war is that way.
But we gotta get this way first.

509
00:47:34,242 --> 00:47:35,588
And where are we going?

510
00:47:35,909 --> 00:47:37,580
We gotta get this
notebook to my superiors.

511
00:47:37,581 --> 00:47:38,901
Hey! Hey...!

512
00:47:38,902 --> 00:47:42,073
No. I let you go. You
take me to Ares.

513
00:47:42,339 --> 00:47:44,071
- We made a deal, Steve Trevor.
- Yeah.

514
00:47:44,072 --> 00:47:45,534
And a deal is a promise.

515
00:47:45,776 --> 00:47:47,676
And a promise is unbreakable.

516
00:47:48,713 --> 00:47:50,631
Oi, damn it, alright.

517
00:47:51,729 --> 00:47:53,414
Come with me first
to deliver this...

518
00:47:53,710 --> 00:47:55,271
and then we'll
give you a ticket...

519
00:47:56,288 --> 00:47:57,289
to the war.

520
00:47:57,572 --> 00:47:58,573
Deal?

521
00:48:00,138 --> 00:48:01,207
- Let's go.
- Diana...

522
00:48:01,416 --> 00:48:02,232
What are you doing?

523
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:04,673
You can not do that because
you're not wearing any clothes.

524
00:48:04,698 --> 00:48:07,909
Let's go... Let's go
buy some clothes.

525
00:48:08,197 --> 00:48:10,114
What do these women
wear into battle?

526
00:48:10,139 --> 00:48:11,491
They don't...

527
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:13,354
A baby!

528
00:48:14,632 --> 00:48:15,850
No, no.. No babies.

529
00:48:17,882 --> 00:48:19,733
One's not made out of clay.

530
00:48:20,047 --> 00:48:21,097
Come on.

531
00:48:21,316 --> 00:48:23,326
Diana! Please.

532
00:48:38,748 --> 00:48:39,981
Thank God! You're not dead!

533
00:48:42,717 --> 00:48:44,285
Hurray!

534
00:48:44,286 --> 00:48:46,619
I did think you're dead till
I got your call, you know?

535
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:49,561
He's been gone for weeks..
Not a single word.

536
00:48:49,884 --> 00:48:50,885
Very unlike him.

537
00:48:51,041 --> 00:48:53,341
I am introducing myself.
It's Etta Candy.

538
00:48:53,342 --> 00:48:55,359
I am Steve Trevor's secretary.

539
00:48:55,646 --> 00:48:56,844
What is a secretary?

540
00:48:57,498 --> 00:48:58,499
Well, I do everything.

541
00:48:58,751 --> 00:49:01,153
I go where he tells me to go and
I do what he tells me to do.

542
00:49:01,311 --> 00:49:03,653
Well, where I am from,
that's called slavery.

543
00:49:03,974 --> 00:49:04,926
I really like her.

544
00:49:04,951 --> 00:49:06,513
Fantastic. Ladies after you.

545
00:49:06,514 --> 00:49:07,683
Oh.. I do, I like her.

546
00:49:16,346 --> 00:49:20,367
Is this what passes for
armor in your country?

547
00:49:21,118 --> 00:49:22,999
Ah. Well, "Oh my". It's fashion.

548
00:49:23,226 --> 00:49:24,632
Keeps our tummies in..

549
00:49:25,201 --> 00:49:26,335
Why must you keep them in?

550
00:49:26,668 --> 00:49:28,793
Any woman with a tummy
would ask that question!

551
00:49:30,587 --> 00:49:34,007
Conservative, but
not entirely unfun.

552
00:49:35,231 --> 00:49:36,556
Try it on at least.

553
00:49:36,916 --> 00:49:37,934
Very well..

554
00:49:39,323 --> 00:49:40,324
No!

555
00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:48,701
Come on!

556
00:49:57,974 --> 00:50:00,636
How can a woman
possibly fight in this?

557
00:50:01,015 --> 00:50:02,025
Fight?

558
00:50:02,026 --> 00:50:03,634
We use our principles.

559
00:50:03,911 --> 00:50:05,538
I mean that's how we
are gonna get to vote.

560
00:50:05,808 --> 00:50:09,419
Although I am not opposed to
engaging in a bitter fist stickups..

561
00:50:09,620 --> 00:50:11,344
Should the occasion arise.

562
00:50:12,799 --> 00:50:14,004
Lovely.

563
00:50:15,749 --> 00:50:17,968
It's itching. It's choking me.

564
00:50:19,443 --> 00:50:21,320
Can they blame it?

565
00:50:21,842 --> 00:50:22,855
Etta.

566
00:50:23,385 --> 00:50:24,133
Where is she?

567
00:50:24,359 --> 00:50:26,617
She's trying on up to number 226.

568
00:50:36,303 --> 00:50:39,530
Ms. Candy, the whole point
was to make her look less

569
00:50:39,753 --> 00:50:40,770
distracting.

570
00:50:43,188 --> 00:50:44,299
May I?

571
00:50:48,824 --> 00:50:50,138
Yeah, really? Specs?

572
00:50:50,352 --> 00:50:52,514
Certainly she's not the most
beautiful woman you've ever seen?

573
00:50:59,259 --> 00:51:00,453
Better.

574
00:51:11,659 --> 00:51:12,874
Yep, that's not gonna work.

575
00:51:13,153 --> 00:51:14,801
Please put the
sword down, Diana.

576
00:51:15,053 --> 00:51:16,054
Diana!

577
00:51:17,275 --> 00:51:18,276
Let me try it by myself.

578
00:51:18,582 --> 00:51:19,582
After you, sir.

579
00:51:29,128 --> 00:51:30,158
Etta...

580
00:51:30,626 --> 00:51:32,850
Why don't I meet you
back at the office?

581
00:51:33,100 --> 00:51:34,921
And meanwhile, I'll take
this for safekeeping.

582
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:36,201
Oh no, I don't think so.

583
00:51:36,237 --> 00:51:38,031
You gotta put the sword down, Diana.
Please.

584
00:51:38,267 --> 00:51:40,039
- It doesn't go with the outfit.
- At all.

585
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:42,326
Put the sword down,
first of all.

586
00:51:44,916 --> 00:51:48,322
Promise me you'll protect
it with your life.

587
00:51:49,055 --> 00:51:50,728
Yes... no.

588
00:51:50,998 --> 00:51:52,921
You can trust her.
Just hand that over.

589
00:51:53,306 --> 00:51:55,098
- Shield.
- And the shield to her..

590
00:51:56,530 --> 00:51:57,562
You got it? Thanks, Etta.

591
00:51:57,587 --> 00:51:58,804
This is easy.

592
00:52:01,135 --> 00:52:02,136
There we go.

593
00:52:30,107 --> 00:52:31,149
What is it?

594
00:52:33,172 --> 00:52:35,224
Hopefully, nothing. Come on.

595
00:52:44,949 --> 00:52:46,991
- Steve, why are we hiding?
- Shh! Come on, come on!

596
00:52:56,790 --> 00:52:58,224
Captain Trevor.

597
00:52:59,149 --> 00:53:02,137
I believe you have something that
is the property of Gen. Ludendorff.

598
00:53:03,898 --> 00:53:06,371
Ah, it's the bad guy convention.

599
00:53:07,150 --> 00:53:08,728
Give us Dr. Maru's note book.

600
00:53:09,558 --> 00:53:10,958
Where I put that thing?

601
00:53:13,134 --> 00:53:13,935
Stand back!

602
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:26,121
Or maybe not.

603
00:53:42,207 --> 00:53:43,208
Oh, tough luck.

604
00:53:49,990 --> 00:53:52,036
Is there anything else
you wanna show me?

605
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:54,727
Where do you think you're going?

606
00:54:01,469 --> 00:54:03,960
I'm sorry, but you're clearly
under Ares' control.

607
00:54:04,555 --> 00:54:06,868
- Diana.
- Let me help you get free.

608
00:54:07,138 --> 00:54:08,568
Where will I find Ares?

609
00:54:16,072 --> 00:54:17,781
He's... He's dead.

610
00:54:19,076 --> 00:54:20,235
Cyanide.

611
00:54:29,191 --> 00:54:30,838
Stay here. I'll be right back.

612
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:33,713
<i>Come on! Gentlemen, please!</i>

613
00:54:39,196 --> 00:54:40,541
<i>Let him speak!</i>

614
00:54:40,641 --> 00:54:41,899
Yes thank you, gentlemen...

615
00:54:42,553 --> 00:54:46,548
<i>Germany is an immensely
proud nation.</i>

616
00:54:47,805 --> 00:54:49,706
<i>They will never surrender.</i>

617
00:54:50,077 --> 00:54:52,733
<i>Now look. The only way
to end this war...</i>

618
00:54:52,734 --> 00:54:55,369
Colonel, I need to
talk to you outside.

619
00:54:55,469 --> 00:54:58,055
<i>And restore world peace...</i>

620
00:54:58,687 --> 00:55:00,329
<i>is to negotiate...</i>

621
00:55:02,136 --> 00:55:03,719
an armistice.

622
00:55:04,425 --> 00:55:05,925
<i>There's a woman.</i>

623
00:55:06,915 --> 00:55:08,379
What is she doing here?
Get her out..

624
00:55:10,344 --> 00:55:11,585
Ger her out..

625
00:55:12,228 --> 00:55:13,229
Sorry.

626
00:55:13,277 --> 00:55:15,732
Blind sister, she got lost
on the way to her bathroom..

627
00:55:15,733 --> 00:55:17,911
I think it's this way.
Sorry guys.

628
00:55:18,638 --> 00:55:20,593
<i>Our only aim at this time...</i>

629
00:55:20,618 --> 00:55:23,438
<i>must be to achieve peace...</i>

630
00:55:23,439 --> 00:55:25,442
<i>at any cost!</i>

631
00:55:29,050 --> 00:55:31,348
Why you been not hearing speech?
He is talking of peace.

632
00:55:31,349 --> 00:55:32,960
Not right now!

633
00:55:37,955 --> 00:55:40,545
Trevor, what the hell were you thinking
bringing a woman into the counsel?

634
00:55:40,546 --> 00:55:42,558
The Intel that I brought
back is time sensitive.

635
00:55:42,851 --> 00:55:44,776
This is one of Dr..
Maru's notebooks.

636
00:55:44,876 --> 00:55:45,512
Notebook or notes...

637
00:55:45,563 --> 00:55:46,440
We need to get it
to Cryptography.

638
00:55:46,441 --> 00:55:48,219
And I need a immediate
audience with the generals.

639
00:55:48,220 --> 00:55:50,302
You do not just barge in here.

640
00:55:50,336 --> 00:55:52,070
Sir with all due respect..
What I saw in my last trip...

641
00:55:52,071 --> 00:55:53,207
will change the course of war.

642
00:55:53,208 --> 00:55:54,798
Captain Trevor!

643
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:58,646
I heard we lost you in
one of your mission...

644
00:55:58,647 --> 00:56:00,078
and yet here you are,
back from the dead...

645
00:56:00,079 --> 00:56:02,029
and I see you brought
a friend with you.

646
00:56:02,058 --> 00:56:03,820
My deepest apology for
interruption sir.

647
00:56:03,958 --> 00:56:05,489
No, no no... non sense.

648
00:56:05,691 --> 00:56:07,457
Thanks to this young woman...

649
00:56:07,759 --> 00:56:11,108
the room was finally quiet enough
for me to get at least a few words in.

650
00:56:11,359 --> 00:56:13,410
Sir Patrick Morgan,
at your service.

651
00:56:13,532 --> 00:56:15,384
Diana, princess of the...

652
00:56:15,626 --> 00:56:17,366
"Prince". Diana Prince.

653
00:56:18,234 --> 00:56:19,282
She is...

654
00:56:19,532 --> 00:56:20,533
and I..

655
00:56:20,699 --> 00:56:21,700
Are...

656
00:56:21,862 --> 00:56:22,863
working together.

657
00:56:23,393 --> 00:56:25,475
She actually helped me bring
this notebook back here.

658
00:56:25,618 --> 00:56:27,280
That's from Dr. Maru's lab.

659
00:56:27,305 --> 00:56:30,572
I think the information it contains
inside will change the course of the war.

660
00:56:30,887 --> 00:56:32,597
My.. God.

661
00:56:33,637 --> 00:56:35,544
- Dr.. Poison herself.
- Yes.

662
00:57:05,939 --> 00:57:06,940
Yes.

663
00:57:07,547 --> 00:57:08,748
Intriguing.

664
00:57:09,007 --> 00:57:10,370
Any further intelligence?

665
00:57:10,616 --> 00:57:13,379
Sadly not, sir.
Cryptography had no luck.

666
00:57:13,599 --> 00:57:15,538
It seems like it's a mixture
of two languages...

667
00:57:15,933 --> 00:57:19,332
but as if they failed to
determine which two languages.

668
00:57:19,677 --> 00:57:21,206
Ottoman & Sumerian.

669
00:57:23,540 --> 00:57:25,886
Surely someone else in
this room knew that.

670
00:57:26,166 --> 00:57:27,197
Who is this woman?

671
00:57:27,466 --> 00:57:29,148
She is my...

672
00:57:29,982 --> 00:57:30,983
secretary, sir.

673
00:57:31,484 --> 00:57:33,716
And she can understand
Ottoman and Sumerian?

674
00:57:34,119 --> 00:57:35,591
She's a very good secretary.

675
00:57:37,932 --> 00:57:40,570
Sir, if this woman
can read it...

676
00:57:40,801 --> 00:57:42,627
we should hear
what she has to say.

677
00:57:42,628 --> 00:57:44,524
Yes, very well.

678
00:57:50,709 --> 00:57:52,353
It's a formula...

679
00:57:52,835 --> 00:57:55,333
for a new kind of gas.

680
00:57:55,358 --> 00:57:58,091
Mustard gas, hydrogen
based instead of sulfur.

681
00:57:58,522 --> 00:57:59,501
<i>Hydrogen based...</i>

682
00:57:59,802 --> 00:58:02,313
Gas masks would be useless
against hydrogen.

683
00:58:02,602 --> 00:58:05,324
The book says, they plan
to release the gas...

684
00:58:05,544 --> 00:58:07,001
At the front?

685
00:58:07,214 --> 00:58:08,013
When?

686
00:58:08,108 --> 00:58:09,381
It doesn't say.

687
00:58:09,835 --> 00:58:11,339
Wait. In "front" of what?

688
00:58:11,364 --> 00:58:12,457
Sir...

689
00:58:12,658 --> 00:58:14,113
that is the evidence we need.

690
00:58:14,114 --> 00:58:15,940
You have to find out where
they are making that gas.

691
00:58:15,941 --> 00:58:17,317
You have to burn
it to the ground.

692
00:58:17,537 --> 00:58:18,538
Destroy it.

693
00:58:18,614 --> 00:58:21,021
Ludendorff was last
seen in Belgium.

694
00:58:21,304 --> 00:58:25,404
We can't be seen in sending troops
into German-occupied Belgium...

695
00:58:25,705 --> 00:58:28,862
As we are negotiating
their surrender.

696
00:58:28,887 --> 00:58:30,766
Sir, I have seen that
gas with my own eyes.

697
00:58:30,799 --> 00:58:33,659
If it is used, it will kill
everyone on both sides.

698
00:58:33,684 --> 00:58:34,530
They will all die.

699
00:58:34,777 --> 00:58:37,720
Yes, that's what
soldiers do, Captain.

700
00:58:38,285 --> 00:58:40,489
Send me in.. with some
logistical support.

701
00:58:40,539 --> 00:58:43,503
At least give me the chance to take
out Ludendorff's operation myself.

702
00:58:43,527 --> 00:58:44,629
Are you insane?

703
00:58:45,130 --> 00:58:47,089
I can't introduce rogue
elements this late in the case.

704
00:58:47,302 --> 00:58:48,026
Sir, I can take...

705
00:58:48,266 --> 00:58:49,510
Now more than ever...

706
00:58:49,794 --> 00:58:53,453
the armistice is off
paramount importance.

707
00:58:53,655 --> 00:58:57,302
It must be negotiated
it must be signed..

708
00:58:58,088 --> 00:59:00,787
It's the best way of
stopping the war.

709
00:59:01,003 --> 00:59:02,902
Captain, you will do nothing.

710
00:59:03,165 --> 00:59:05,220
And that's an order.

711
00:59:06,109 --> 00:59:07,110
Yes sir.

712
00:59:08,463 --> 00:59:09,464
I understand, sir.

713
00:59:10,269 --> 00:59:11,294
I don't!

714
00:59:11,702 --> 00:59:13,063
Diana, I know this confusing...

715
00:59:13,144 --> 00:59:15,477
- It is not confusing! It's unthinkable!
- Who is this woman?

716
00:59:15,478 --> 00:59:16,594
She is with me, she is with us.

717
00:59:16,595 --> 00:59:17,599
I'm not.. I am not with you!

718
00:59:17,877 --> 00:59:20,838
You would knowingly
sacrifice all those lives.

719
00:59:20,839 --> 00:59:22,302
As if they mean less than yours.

720
00:59:22,327 --> 00:59:24,414
- Diana, let's talk about it outside.
- As if they mean nothing?

721
00:59:24,415 --> 00:59:27,449
Where I come from, generals don't
hide in their offices like cowards.

722
00:59:27,450 --> 00:59:29,696
That's enough! They fight
alongside their soldiers.

723
00:59:29,697 --> 00:59:31,525
They die with them
on the battlefield!

724
00:59:31,526 --> 00:59:33,250
- That's enough! My apologies.
- You should be ashamed.

725
00:59:33,251 --> 00:59:34,323
- My apologies.
- You should be ashamed.

726
00:59:34,624 --> 00:59:36,397
- Diana... Diana!
- All of you should be ashamed!

727
00:59:38,071 --> 00:59:39,520
Please slow down!

728
00:59:39,738 --> 00:59:40,929
Is that your leader?

729
00:59:41,266 --> 00:59:43,312
How could he say that?
Believe that?

730
00:59:43,630 --> 00:59:44,968
And.. and you!

731
00:59:45,198 --> 00:59:47,458
Was your duty to simply
give them a book?

732
00:59:47,488 --> 00:59:47,819
No!

733
00:59:48,011 --> 00:59:49,640
You didn't stand your ground.
You didn't fight.

734
00:59:49,641 --> 00:59:51,313
Because there was no chance
of changing anything.

735
00:59:51,314 --> 00:59:54,701
This is Ares and he's not
going to allow negotiation,

736
00:59:54,726 --> 00:59:56,051
nor a surrender!

737
00:59:56,076 --> 00:59:58,778
The millions of people you
talked about, they will die.

738
00:59:58,803 --> 01:00:00,163
We are going anyway!

739
01:00:02,510 --> 01:00:04,368
You mean you were lying?

740
01:00:04,769 --> 01:00:06,468
I'm a spy! That's what I do!

741
01:00:06,568 --> 01:00:08,686
How do I know you're not
lying to me right now?

742
01:00:13,689 --> 01:00:15,245
I'm taking you to the front.

743
01:00:15,553 --> 01:00:17,640
We are afraid you're gonna die.

744
01:00:18,719 --> 01:00:20,667
This is a terrible idea.

745
01:00:25,358 --> 01:00:27,105
We're gonna need reinforcements.

746
01:00:37,889 --> 01:00:39,879
These are the reinforcements?

747
01:00:39,904 --> 01:00:40,905
Yep.

748
01:00:41,037 --> 01:00:42,995
Are these even good men?

749
01:00:43,621 --> 01:00:45,206
Well, relatively.

750
01:00:46,354 --> 01:00:50,396
Even in Africa gentlemen, we
haven't seen such luxuries.

751
01:00:50,421 --> 01:00:54,702
The luxury that we have now is like...
is like we can't stop making money!

752
01:00:54,727 --> 01:00:57,090
So my uncle, the
Prince, and I...

753
01:00:57,651 --> 01:00:59,082
Which prince is that?

754
01:00:59,708 --> 01:01:01,850
I decided to extend
your profanity...

755
01:01:01,851 --> 01:01:03,473
But seriously, which prince?

756
01:01:04,328 --> 01:01:06,942
Hey, Sultan, Angoora,
Next Kashmir...

757
01:01:07,091 --> 01:01:08,892
<i>Care to talk for a minute?</i>

758
01:01:09,464 --> 01:01:11,596
Gentlemen, excuse me one second.

759
01:01:12,694 --> 01:01:14,265
- A bar... Well, a pub.
- You hypocrite.

760
01:01:14,465 --> 01:01:17,604
I've been racing those peacocks
all night, and you've...

761
01:01:18,017 --> 01:01:19,717
Oh my goodness, gracious.

762
01:01:20,707 --> 01:01:21,540
That's a work of art.

763
01:01:21,541 --> 01:01:23,819
Sameer, Diana. Diana, Sameer!

764
01:01:23,844 --> 01:01:26,097
Hi, Diana. You can
call me Sammy please.

765
01:01:26,122 --> 01:01:26,931
"Sammy".

766
01:01:26,932 --> 01:01:29,472
Oh Sameer, I wouldn't...
do that if I were you.

767
01:01:29,515 --> 01:01:30,821
Sameer is a top undercover man.

768
01:01:30,846 --> 01:01:33,491
He can talk the skin off a
cabbage many ways as you can.

769
01:01:33,806 --> 01:01:36,500
<i>He doesn't look that
impressive to me.</i>

770
01:01:36,701 --> 01:01:38,153
<i>You do for me.</i>

771
01:01:38,517 --> 01:01:41,438
<i>Your eyes, as soft
as your smile.</i>

772
01:01:41,664 --> 01:01:42,615
<i>And your eyes...</i>

773
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:45,518
<i>looks like they want something.</i>

774
01:01:45,956 --> 01:01:47,876
<i>I know Chinese too, tricky girl.</i>

775
01:01:47,918 --> 01:01:50,160
<i>But, can you recite
Socrates in ancient Greek?</i>

776
01:01:52,521 --> 01:01:53,524
Oh, you're done.

777
01:01:53,549 --> 01:01:54,550
Where is Charlie?

778
01:01:58,678 --> 01:01:59,679
Voila!

779
01:02:02,408 --> 01:02:04,817
At least this Charlie
is good with his fists.

780
01:02:06,085 --> 01:02:07,218
That's not Charlie.

781
01:02:15,201 --> 01:02:16,302
That's Charlie.

782
01:02:20,740 --> 01:02:21,741
Steven!

783
01:02:21,790 --> 01:02:24,731
May god grow a flower
upon your head son.

784
01:02:24,831 --> 01:02:25,875
Good to see you.

785
01:02:27,441 --> 01:02:29,344
So what were you fighting about?

786
01:02:30,587 --> 01:02:33,078
I mistook his glass for mine.
That happens.

787
01:02:33,242 --> 01:02:34,813
This man is no fighter.

788
01:02:35,026 --> 01:02:37,035
Charlie is an expert marksman.

789
01:02:37,605 --> 01:02:38,917
Means he shoots people.

790
01:02:38,942 --> 01:02:40,507
From very far away.

791
01:02:40,832 --> 01:02:42,102
You never know what hit 'em.

792
01:02:43,789 --> 01:02:46,332
So, how do you know who you kill
if you can't see their face?

793
01:02:46,533 --> 01:02:48,695
I don't. Trust me
it's better that way.

794
01:02:48,844 --> 01:02:50,293
You fight without honor.

795
01:02:50,601 --> 01:02:52,450
Who gets paid for honor?

796
01:02:53,825 --> 01:02:55,217
So, what's the job, boss?

797
01:02:56,715 --> 01:02:57,731
Two days tops.

798
01:02:57,732 --> 01:03:00,354
We need supplies and
passage to Belgium.

799
01:03:00,454 --> 01:03:01,686
What's the going rate?

800
01:03:01,786 --> 01:03:02,499
Better be a good pay.

801
01:03:02,500 --> 01:03:04,711
Yeah, well, here's the thing.

802
01:03:06,856 --> 01:03:07,826
I told you it was
going to be quick.

803
01:03:09,110 --> 01:03:11,521
And there's a lot to
be gained by this.

804
01:03:11,796 --> 01:03:13,720
It's for a great cause...

805
01:03:15,019 --> 01:03:16,020
Freedom.

806
01:03:16,554 --> 01:03:17,962
Friendship...

807
01:03:20,531 --> 01:03:21,728
ending the war, friendship...

808
01:03:21,729 --> 01:03:23,085
- Okay, You have no money.
- No.

809
01:03:23,386 --> 01:03:26,363
<i>All I want now is a picture
of that beautiful face.</i>

810
01:03:27,533 --> 01:03:29,343
<i>You will not need a photo...</i>

811
01:03:29,728 --> 01:03:30,678
<i>because I'll go with you.</i>

812
01:03:31,749 --> 01:03:32,750
What?

813
01:03:32,805 --> 01:03:33,875
What is this?

814
01:03:33,903 --> 01:03:35,236
We're gonna drop
her up at front!

815
01:03:35,527 --> 01:03:37,129
- "Dr..opping her off"?
- Yeah.

816
01:03:37,827 --> 01:03:39,886
Question sweetheart, I am not
gonna get myself killed...

817
01:03:39,987 --> 01:03:41,287
with helping every last human.

818
01:03:41,333 --> 01:03:43,933
- That's no I mean.
- Here's the little thief now!

819
01:03:57,682 --> 01:04:00,831
I am both frightened
and aroused.

820
01:04:06,472 --> 01:04:09,004
Oh here they are! Sorry I'm late.
Sir Patrick!

821
01:04:09,029 --> 01:04:10,648
Yes, that's what I
was gonna mention.

822
01:04:12,025 --> 01:04:13,684
- Sir Patrick.
- No... No...!

823
01:04:14,129 --> 01:04:16,163
Gentlemen, sit. Ms.
Prince, sit..

824
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:22,913
I assume you are here
planning something...

825
01:04:22,985 --> 01:04:25,960
that's going to get you
either court martial or killed.

826
01:04:26,112 --> 01:04:28,201
And I assume, you are
here to stop us.

827
01:04:28,751 --> 01:04:29,752
No.

828
01:04:30,231 --> 01:04:32,043
Not at all in fact..

829
01:04:32,867 --> 01:04:33,809
Well, look.

830
01:04:33,834 --> 01:04:35,001
I was an younger man once.

831
01:04:35,002 --> 01:04:38,912
And had I been in better health, I like
to think that I might do the same.

832
01:04:39,999 --> 01:04:42,446
It's very very honorable
thing you're doing.

833
01:04:42,546 --> 01:04:43,173
Therefore..

834
01:04:44,224 --> 01:04:45,525
I am here to help.

835
01:04:46,123 --> 01:04:47,499
Unofficially, of course.

836
01:04:48,640 --> 01:04:49,868
What's your plan?

837
01:04:51,399 --> 01:04:54,504
If there's another weapon's
facility, find it and destroy it.

838
01:04:54,973 --> 01:04:56,781
Along with Ludendorff and Maru.

839
01:04:57,870 --> 01:05:00,454
In that case, to
allay suspicion...

840
01:05:01,492 --> 01:05:05,801
our charming Etta could run
the mission from my office.

841
01:05:06,155 --> 01:05:07,156
"Run"...

842
01:05:09,300 --> 01:05:10,301
Also.

843
01:05:11,336 --> 01:05:13,794
There is enough
here for a few days.

844
01:05:19,438 --> 01:05:20,439
Thank you sir.

845
01:05:20,592 --> 01:05:21,915
You're very welcome.

846
01:05:22,787 --> 01:05:24,541
Take great care all of you...

847
01:05:24,566 --> 01:05:25,567
and good luck.

848
01:05:46,875 --> 01:05:48,777
<i>Fresh ice-cream.</i>

849
01:05:48,878 --> 01:05:50,782
Hello miss, would you
like to buy an ice cream?

850
01:05:50,903 --> 01:05:52,322
- Me?
- You hungry?

851
01:05:52,574 --> 01:05:53,575
Yes.

852
01:05:54,016 --> 01:05:54,754
Thank you.

853
01:05:54,779 --> 01:05:56,220
Eight pence please, sir.

854
01:05:56,542 --> 01:05:57,684
There you go, and
keep the change.

855
01:05:57,685 --> 01:05:59,227
Thank you very much sir.

856
01:06:00,378 --> 01:06:01,880
- What you doing?
- It's wonderful!

857
01:06:01,905 --> 01:06:03,057
Yeah.

858
01:06:04,032 --> 01:06:06,684
- You should be very proud.
- Thank you very much!

859
01:06:06,709 --> 01:06:08,086
You should be very proud.

860
01:06:18,566 --> 01:06:21,367
I hope I got niches here. The
chief's expecting us before dark.

861
01:06:22,513 --> 01:06:23,620
Chief?

862
01:06:24,645 --> 01:06:26,226
Oh yeah. A smuggler.

863
01:06:27,063 --> 01:06:28,420
Very reputable.

864
01:06:28,849 --> 01:06:31,826
A liar, a murderer,
and now a smuggler.

865
01:06:32,430 --> 01:06:33,431
Lovely.

866
01:06:33,901 --> 01:06:35,102
Careful, I might get offended.

867
01:06:35,126 --> 01:06:36,628
I wasn't referring to you.

868
01:06:37,479 --> 01:06:38,480
Really?

869
01:06:38,493 --> 01:06:40,742
I wanna recover from pretending
to be somebody else.

870
01:06:40,867 --> 01:06:42,816
I shot people on your
beach, smuggle a notebook.

871
01:06:42,817 --> 01:06:45,422
A liar, murderer and smuggler.
You still coming?

872
01:07:04,975 --> 01:07:05,976
It's awful.

873
01:07:07,316 --> 01:07:08,759
That's why we're here.

874
01:07:26,898 --> 01:07:28,634
The gas will kill everything.

875
01:07:28,959 --> 01:07:31,083
What kind weapons
kills innocents?

876
01:07:32,011 --> 01:07:33,504
In this war...

877
01:07:33,622 --> 01:07:34,773
Every kind.

878
01:07:40,819 --> 01:07:43,136
You were absent at the
counsel meeting, General.

879
01:07:43,161 --> 01:07:46,018
I see you are negotiating the terms
of the armistice without me.

880
01:07:46,043 --> 01:07:48,547
- On the Kaiser's behalf.
- I'm on your insistence.

881
01:07:49,427 --> 01:07:52,430
We could easily win this war if
only you had a little faith.

882
01:07:52,455 --> 01:07:53,686
We don't.

883
01:07:54,011 --> 01:07:56,041
There are shortages of food...

884
01:07:56,066 --> 01:07:57,911
meds and ammunition.

885
01:07:58,918 --> 01:08:02,802
Every hour we delay costs
thousands of German lives.

886
01:08:02,927 --> 01:08:05,659
One attack and the
world could be ours.

887
01:08:08,020 --> 01:08:10,051
As we speak, my chemistry...

888
01:08:10,076 --> 01:08:12,223
We stand against you and your...

889
01:08:12,248 --> 01:08:13,487
witch.

890
01:08:14,223 --> 01:08:19,402
Ludendorff, enough!
24 hours from now...

891
01:08:19,427 --> 01:08:21,399
this war will end.

892
01:08:21,947 --> 01:08:23,583
It is over.

893
01:08:24,772 --> 01:08:26,200
It's over for you.

894
01:08:30,104 --> 01:08:31,413
It is over for all of you..

895
01:08:48,049 --> 01:08:50,040
But the mask won't help.

896
01:08:50,065 --> 01:08:51,308
They don't know that.

897
01:09:06,260 --> 01:09:07,520
Let's go.

898
01:09:07,545 --> 01:09:10,197
Time to stage a demonstration
for the Kaiser!

899
01:09:12,871 --> 01:09:13,403
You're late.

900
01:09:13,704 --> 01:09:14,830
Cowboy sneak attack, chief!

901
01:09:16,162 --> 01:09:17,174
How are you?

902
01:09:18,089 --> 01:09:20,085
- Good to see you pal.
- Big mike.

903
01:09:22,598 --> 01:09:24,326
- Good to see you.
- Oh yes!

904
01:09:25,219 --> 01:09:26,720
Good to see you my friend.

905
01:09:27,487 --> 01:09:28,707
Yah beauty!

906
01:09:29,132 --> 01:09:30,502
Who is this?

907
01:09:37,412 --> 01:09:39,058
And I am Diana.

908
01:09:40,449 --> 01:09:41,499
Where did you find her?

909
01:09:41,663 --> 01:09:42,927
She found me.

910
01:09:43,332 --> 01:09:45,520
- I plucked him from the sea.
- Well. It's a long story.

911
01:09:45,621 --> 01:09:47,133
You don't have to talk
about that right now.

912
01:09:47,134 --> 01:09:48,535
What's there?

913
01:09:49,924 --> 01:09:51,826
British tea from the Germans...

914
01:09:52,081 --> 01:09:54,042
German beer for the British.

915
01:09:54,067 --> 01:09:58,132
And Edgar Rice Brurroughs
novels for both.

916
01:09:58,343 --> 01:09:59,644
And guns!

917
01:10:00,821 --> 01:10:04,413
Well... May we get what we want?

918
01:10:04,438 --> 01:10:05,646
May we get what we need.

919
01:10:06,040 --> 01:10:08,041
But may we never get
what we deserve.

920
01:10:08,066 --> 01:10:09,067
Bang!

921
01:10:16,691 --> 01:10:17,915
Strange thunder.

922
01:10:19,430 --> 01:10:20,937
German 77's.

923
01:10:21,286 --> 01:10:22,708
Guns, big ones.

924
01:10:23,823 --> 01:10:25,269
It's the front out there.

925
01:10:26,473 --> 01:10:30,497
- The evening hay.
- So, who do you fight for in this war?

926
01:10:30,522 --> 01:10:31,791
I don't fight.

927
01:10:31,816 --> 01:10:33,681
You're here for profits then?

928
01:10:34,166 --> 01:10:36,127
No better place to be.

929
01:10:37,117 --> 01:10:39,599
Nowhere better to be than in a
war where you don't take a side.

930
01:10:40,018 --> 01:10:42,175
I have no where else.
The last war took

931
01:10:42,200 --> 01:10:44,840
everything from my people.
We have nothing left.

932
01:10:45,535 --> 01:10:46,905
At least here...

933
01:10:47,332 --> 01:10:48,691
I'm free.

934
01:10:49,510 --> 01:10:51,275
Who took that from your people?

935
01:10:52,037 --> 01:10:53,218
His people.

936
01:10:58,175 --> 01:10:59,223
<i>Don't go...</i>

937
01:11:00,094 --> 01:11:02,873
<i>Don't go there. Do not go!</i>

938
01:11:04,712 --> 01:11:06,231
<i>Don't go in there.</i>

939
01:11:06,256 --> 01:11:07,354
You are safe.

940
01:11:07,555 --> 01:11:10,185
You are safe. Are you okay?

941
01:11:10,429 --> 01:11:11,754
Shut up, you woman!

942
01:11:11,779 --> 01:11:13,532
Stop making a fuss!

943
01:11:13,855 --> 01:11:15,014
God!

944
01:11:19,099 --> 01:11:21,474
He sees ghosts.

945
01:11:26,412 --> 01:11:27,500
Hey, you're gonna get cold.

946
01:11:27,525 --> 01:11:28,747
Oh I do...

947
01:11:29,226 --> 01:11:31,677
Don't worry about Charlie. He
doesn't mean any, alright?

948
01:11:51,837 --> 01:11:53,856
These animals, why are
they hurting them?

949
01:11:54,403 --> 01:11:55,999
Because they need to move quick!

950
01:11:56,247 --> 01:11:58,444
- Like us!
- But this is not the way.

951
01:11:58,644 --> 01:12:00,079
I could help them.

952
01:12:00,080 --> 01:12:01,383
There is no time.
Come on, woman!

953
01:12:04,811 --> 01:12:05,813
Mama!

954
01:12:10,575 --> 01:12:12,696
That man... he's wounded.

955
01:12:12,997 --> 01:12:15,154
There is nothing you can
do about it, Diana.

956
01:12:15,424 --> 01:12:16,736
We must keep moving.

957
01:12:38,021 --> 01:12:38,864
What is this?

958
01:12:39,078 --> 01:12:40,971
You wanted me to take you to war.
This is it.

959
01:12:41,038 --> 01:12:42,468
Then where are the Germans?

960
01:12:42,812 --> 01:12:44,976
Couple of 100 yards
across the field.

961
01:12:45,240 --> 01:12:46,663
- The trench is...
- Watch out!

962
01:12:49,321 --> 01:12:51,350
Chief! Oh it's good to see you.

963
01:12:51,650 --> 01:12:53,815
Oi, chief's back! Chief's back!

964
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:56,283
Alright, let's move.

965
01:12:57,516 --> 01:12:59,257
<i>Help me please.</i>

966
01:12:59,550 --> 01:13:01,422
<i>They have taken everything...</i>

967
01:13:01,423 --> 01:13:03,429
<i>houses, food...</i>

968
01:13:03,673 --> 01:13:05,509
<i>and those who
could not escape...</i>

969
01:13:05,726 --> 01:13:07,625
<i>they were taken away as slaves.</i>

970
01:13:07,626 --> 01:13:08,868
<i>Where did that happen?</i>

971
01:13:08,869 --> 01:13:12,149
<i>In Veld... On the other
side of No Man's Land.</i>

972
01:13:12,150 --> 01:13:13,247
Diana, we have to go.

973
01:13:13,248 --> 01:13:14,685
We need to help these people.

974
01:13:14,710 --> 01:13:15,857
We have to stay on mission!

975
01:13:15,858 --> 01:13:17,539
Next safe crossing is
at least a day away.

976
01:13:17,753 --> 01:13:20,321
- What are we waiting for?
- We can not leave without helping them.

977
01:13:20,322 --> 01:13:21,856
These people are dying.

978
01:13:22,105 --> 01:13:23,732
Nothing to eat and
in the village...

979
01:13:23,945 --> 01:13:25,387
- enslaved it there!
- I understand that.

980
01:13:25,388 --> 01:13:26,389
Women and children!

981
01:13:26,412 --> 01:13:27,689
We need to make our next
position by sunset.

982
01:13:27,690 --> 01:13:29,730
How can you say that? What
is the matter with you?

983
01:13:30,393 --> 01:13:32,353
This is No Man's Land! Diana!

984
01:13:32,962 --> 01:13:34,877
Means no man can
cross it, alright?

985
01:13:35,178 --> 01:13:37,301
This battalion has been
here for nearly a year...

986
01:13:37,626 --> 01:13:39,884
and they barely gained an inch.

987
01:13:40,098 --> 01:13:42,797
Alright? Because on the other side,
there are a bunch of Germans

988
01:13:42,822 --> 01:13:45,624
pointing machine guns at every
square inch of this place.

989
01:13:45,875 --> 01:13:48,123
This is not something you can cross.
This is not possible.

990
01:13:48,124 --> 01:13:49,516
So what? So we do nothing?

991
01:13:49,733 --> 01:13:51,607
No, we are doing something.

992
01:13:51,608 --> 01:13:52,987
- We are, we just...
- Steve.

993
01:13:53,234 --> 01:13:54,623
We can't save
everyone in this war.

994
01:13:54,850 --> 01:13:56,082
Steve...

995
01:13:56,315 --> 01:13:57,972
This is not what we
came here to do.

996
01:14:14,421 --> 01:14:15,422
No...

997
01:14:15,474 --> 01:14:17,374
but it's what I'm going to do.

998
01:14:32,648 --> 01:14:33,907
Diana!

999
01:14:56,094 --> 01:14:58,385
What the bloody hell
she's playing at?

1000
01:15:04,050 --> 01:15:06,050
<i>Engage, fire!</i>

1001
01:15:14,892 --> 01:15:17,078
She's taking all the fire!
Let's go!

1002
01:15:20,765 --> 01:15:22,654
Sniper! Stay down!

1003
01:15:22,655 --> 01:15:24,202
Stay down! That's an order!

1004
01:16:17,389 --> 01:16:18,390
Come on!

1005
01:16:18,547 --> 01:16:20,294
She's done it! Let's go!

1006
01:16:40,317 --> 01:16:41,318
Steve!

1007
01:16:41,749 --> 01:16:42,896
Let's go!

1008
01:16:45,643 --> 01:16:47,400
Come on, go!

1009
01:17:07,798 --> 01:17:09,409
Stay here, I'll go ahead.

1010
01:17:44,948 --> 01:17:46,225
- What the...
- Let's move.

1011
01:18:24,610 --> 01:18:26,037
We need more firepower.

1012
01:19:42,533 --> 01:19:43,534
Sniper!

1013
01:19:43,598 --> 01:19:44,811
Move!

1014
01:19:47,147 --> 01:19:47,912
Get in!

1015
01:19:48,213 --> 01:19:49,620
Charlie, bell tower.

1016
01:19:57,876 --> 01:19:59,146
Come on, Charlie. Shoot him.

1017
01:20:00,720 --> 01:20:02,259
It's okay.

1018
01:20:07,237 --> 01:20:09,239
Follow me. Give me some cover.

1019
01:20:15,947 --> 01:20:17,001
Good!

1020
01:20:17,002 --> 01:20:20,081
We're gonna put this on our
back and when I say go..

1021
01:20:20,106 --> 01:20:21,267
- Lift hard!
- All right.

1022
01:20:22,338 --> 01:20:24,451
Diana! Shield!

1023
01:20:28,148 --> 01:20:29,149
Go!

1024
01:21:31,347 --> 01:21:33,726
Stay very very still,
for me my friends.

1025
01:21:33,751 --> 01:21:35,389
Please. It's so important.

1026
01:21:39,359 --> 01:21:40,529
Thank you very much.

1027
01:21:40,554 --> 01:21:43,423
This has been such an honor
for me taking you photograph.

1028
01:21:43,448 --> 01:21:44,514
Thank you so much.

1029
01:21:50,950 --> 01:21:53,169
For obvious talk of shooting...

1030
01:21:53,490 --> 01:21:55,261
you cannot shoot.

1031
01:21:57,908 --> 01:22:00,326
Not everyone gets to be where
they want to be all the time.

1032
01:22:00,991 --> 01:22:03,373
Me, I'm an actor.

1033
01:22:03,522 --> 01:22:04,835
I love acting.

1034
01:22:05,101 --> 01:22:06,718
I didn't want to be a soldier.

1035
01:22:08,027 --> 01:22:09,368
But I'm the wrong color.

1036
01:22:10,381 --> 01:22:12,670
Everyone's fighting their
own battle, Diana.

1037
01:22:14,326 --> 01:22:15,631
Just as you're fighting yours.

1038
01:22:21,383 --> 01:22:23,287
<i>Oh it's too much. I wish you...</i>

1039
01:22:23,288 --> 01:22:24,289
<i>Thank you.</i>

1040
01:22:28,404 --> 01:22:29,981
Hi.. I'm on the phone...

1041
01:22:30,399 --> 01:22:33,471
Ah, it's "Veld", V-E-L-D.

1042
01:22:33,496 --> 01:22:35,203
It's a tiny village.

1043
01:22:35,228 --> 01:22:37,084
It may not even be on the map.

1044
01:22:37,109 --> 01:22:38,400
Ooh! I found it!

1045
01:22:38,654 --> 01:22:40,514
Did you find
Ludendorff's operation?

1046
01:22:40,539 --> 01:22:42,253
No. No, but I located him.

1047
01:22:42,419 --> 01:22:45,290
And oh, lucky you, he's
only a few miles away...

1048
01:22:45,315 --> 01:22:47,031
At German High Command.

1049
01:22:47,488 --> 01:22:49,031
The German High Command?

1050
01:22:49,154 --> 01:22:50,508
And to Intel report...

1051
01:22:50,779 --> 01:22:53,000
Ludendorff is hosting a gala..

1052
01:22:53,216 --> 01:22:54,534
Sort of a last Hara...

1053
01:22:54,859 --> 01:22:57,361
before the Germans
sign the armistice.

1054
01:22:57,386 --> 01:23:00,241
And then the Kaiser himself
is going to be there.

1055
01:23:00,468 --> 01:23:02,894
As well as Dr... Maru.

1056
01:23:03,645 --> 01:23:05,292
Actually the Gala could
be perfect cover.

1057
01:23:05,317 --> 01:23:07,279
- Captain Trevor.
- Yes sir.

1058
01:23:07,304 --> 01:23:10,508
You're under no circumstances
to go anywhere near that...

1059
01:23:10,533 --> 01:23:12,070
gala tomorrow night.
Do you hear me?

1060
01:23:12,121 --> 01:23:14,637
You'll be jeopardizing
everything we've worked for.

1061
01:23:14,662 --> 01:23:16,480
You can not compromise
the armistice.

1062
01:23:16,945 --> 01:23:18,416
- Sir, there will be no armistice...
- Steve!

1063
01:23:18,417 --> 01:23:20,410
Once Ludendorff bombs
the entire front line.

1064
01:23:20,664 --> 01:23:21,718
Hold on one second, sir.

1065
01:23:21,743 --> 01:23:24,028
We shouldn't be bothered about
setting the peace agreement.

1066
01:23:24,029 --> 01:23:25,705
- Why not?
- Ares would never let...

1067
01:23:26,306 --> 01:23:27,307
What?

1068
01:23:27,833 --> 01:23:28,834
What is that?

1069
01:23:29,093 --> 01:23:31,206
Of course, it makes
complete sense.

1070
01:23:32,796 --> 01:23:35,882
Ares developed a weapon,
the worst ever devised.

1071
01:23:35,907 --> 01:23:37,584
- Ares? You mean Ludendorff.
- No.

1072
01:23:38,149 --> 01:23:39,543
I mean Ares.

1073
01:23:40,189 --> 01:23:42,347
Ludendorff is Ares!

1074
01:23:43,237 --> 01:23:45,279
Sir, this is our last chance...

1075
01:23:45,304 --> 01:23:47,054
our final chance to find
out where the gas is...

1076
01:23:47,055 --> 01:23:49,380
and to learn how Ludendorff
plans on delivering it.

1077
01:23:49,405 --> 01:23:51,282
No... No.. No. I forbid it.

1078
01:23:51,307 --> 01:23:52,457
Do you hear me? I forbid it.

1079
01:23:52,482 --> 01:23:54,208
Sir, I am losing you! Sir?

1080
01:23:54,233 --> 01:23:55,663
- Hello?
- Sir...

1081
01:23:58,966 --> 01:24:00,643
How likely is he to
respect my wishes?

1082
01:24:00,668 --> 01:24:02,952
Not very like convinced.

1083
01:24:08,580 --> 01:24:10,382
Sammy, Sammy, no, no.

1084
01:24:10,860 --> 01:24:11,974
Sammy, I have to work.

1085
01:24:12,381 --> 01:24:15,784
I gotta rustle up with a German uniform
I took to plough the course tomorrow.

1086
01:24:15,884 --> 01:24:17,082
That's easy, boss. Come on.

1087
01:24:17,331 --> 01:24:18,873
There's nothing we can
do till tomorrow.

1088
01:24:18,874 --> 01:24:19,915
You said yourself, Steve.

1089
01:24:25,834 --> 01:24:27,198
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1090
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:46,631
You did this.

1091
01:24:48,892 --> 01:24:49,946
We did.

1092
01:24:54,700 --> 01:24:56,292
Do you have dancing on...

1093
01:24:57,341 --> 01:24:58,556
Paradise Island?

1094
01:24:58,581 --> 01:25:00,302
Oh, dancing, yeah of course.

1095
01:25:01,283 --> 01:25:04,442
These people are just...
swaying.

1096
01:25:05,439 --> 01:25:08,793
Okay, if you're gonna be
fighting the God of war...

1097
01:25:08,794 --> 01:25:12,214
I might as well teach you
how to dance, you poor thing.

1098
01:25:12,269 --> 01:25:14,832
Alright, probably
without the gun.

1099
01:25:18,959 --> 01:25:20,410
If you would...

1100
01:25:21,260 --> 01:25:22,261
Well...

1101
01:25:24,110 --> 01:25:26,794
If I'm going to the Gala, I'll
need to know how to dance.

1102
01:25:26,819 --> 01:25:27,954
- You aren't going to the Gala.
- Of course I am.

1103
01:25:27,955 --> 01:25:30,006
- No.
- Why wouldn't I?

1104
01:25:30,213 --> 01:25:32,116
Well, for one, you don't
know how to dance.

1105
01:25:32,746 --> 01:25:35,097
I would argue with this, they
don't know how to dance.

1106
01:25:35,346 --> 01:25:36,525
Be polite. Be polite.

1107
01:25:39,352 --> 01:25:41,711
All right. Give me your hand.

1108
01:25:41,712 --> 01:25:42,985
Like so.

1109
01:25:43,656 --> 01:25:46,877
And I'll put my arm...

1110
01:25:46,878 --> 01:25:48,742
around you like so.

1111
01:25:49,670 --> 01:25:51,554
And we just..

1112
01:25:51,893 --> 01:25:53,296
What do you call it? Sway?

1113
01:25:53,321 --> 01:25:54,322
We'll just sway.

1114
01:25:55,011 --> 01:25:56,580
You're awfully close.

1115
01:25:58,814 --> 01:26:00,867
Nice Ritz.

1116
01:26:03,833 --> 01:26:05,075
I see.

1117
01:26:13,840 --> 01:26:16,022
I haven't heard him
sing in years.

1118
01:26:33,359 --> 01:26:35,313
It's started to snowfall.

1119
01:26:39,648 --> 01:26:40,735
Touch it.

1120
01:26:44,208 --> 01:26:45,712
It's magical!

1121
01:26:46,277 --> 01:26:47,909
It is, isn't it?

1122
01:26:50,098 --> 01:26:51,413
Yes, yeah.

1123
01:26:58,072 --> 01:27:01,478
Is this what people do when
there are no wars to fight?

1124
01:27:02,449 --> 01:27:03,450
Yeah.

1125
01:27:04,488 --> 01:27:07,491
Yeah, this... and other things.

1126
01:27:07,733 --> 01:27:09,164
What things?

1127
01:27:16,674 --> 01:27:18,217
They have breakfast.

1128
01:27:18,838 --> 01:27:20,427
They really love a breakfast.

1129
01:27:20,455 --> 01:27:23,290
And they love to wake up...

1130
01:27:24,261 --> 01:27:26,434
read the paper and go to work.

1131
01:27:27,513 --> 01:27:29,131
They get married.

1132
01:27:29,927 --> 01:27:31,620
Makes some babies and
grow old together.

1133
01:27:32,131 --> 01:27:33,164
I guess.

1134
01:27:37,156 --> 01:27:38,707
What is that like?

1135
01:27:42,837 --> 01:27:44,271
I have no idea.

1136
01:29:19,378 --> 01:29:20,710
The villagers gave them to us.

1137
01:29:21,510 --> 01:29:24,098
- A gracious gift.
- And they call us heroes.

1138
01:29:24,675 --> 01:29:25,676
You are.

1139
01:29:26,341 --> 01:29:28,038
Hey, fellas, I know that...

1140
01:29:29,336 --> 01:29:31,227
I said this job was 2 day's...

1141
01:29:33,269 --> 01:29:34,470
and a deal is a deal.

1142
01:29:36,617 --> 01:29:38,075
You can't last without us.

1143
01:29:38,963 --> 01:29:39,964
Yeah.

1144
01:29:40,178 --> 01:29:42,340
We all know Diana is capable
of taking care of herself.

1145
01:29:42,901 --> 01:29:44,674
I'm worried that
you won't make it.

1146
01:29:45,379 --> 01:29:46,204
No more money.

1147
01:29:46,229 --> 01:29:47,621
We have been paid enough.

1148
01:29:51,495 --> 01:29:52,999
No, Charlie.

1149
01:29:54,377 --> 01:29:56,334
Who will sing for us?

1150
01:29:57,332 --> 01:29:59,341
- Yeah.
- Oh no, please.

1151
01:30:00,381 --> 01:30:01,447
Sing?

1152
01:30:02,836 --> 01:30:03,837
You asked for it.

1153
01:30:04,018 --> 01:30:06,362
<i>The reeds are green.</i>

1154
01:30:06,839 --> 01:30:10,463
<i>The reeds are green.</i>

1155
01:30:10,726 --> 01:30:14,253
<i>The sweetest hours I could live.</i>

1156
01:30:15,268 --> 01:30:17,489
You must think I was
born yesterday.

1157
01:30:17,706 --> 01:30:19,413
I know it sounds
crazy, but it's true.

1158
01:30:19,678 --> 01:30:20,769
Every word.

1159
01:30:21,259 --> 01:30:22,523
Wait... wait.

1160
01:30:22,524 --> 01:30:24,662
There is a whole island
of women like her?

1161
01:30:24,864 --> 01:30:26,468
And not a single man among them?

1162
01:30:27,939 --> 01:30:28,809
How do we get there?

1163
01:30:30,089 --> 01:30:31,010
And she thinks..

1164
01:30:31,011 --> 01:30:33,163
That Ludendorff is
Ares, the god of war?

1165
01:30:33,194 --> 01:30:34,981
And only by killing
him will the war end.

1166
01:30:35,722 --> 01:30:38,334
Don't be daft. You saw
what happened out there.

1167
01:30:38,528 --> 01:30:40,431
The way she dropped
that machine gun next.

1168
01:30:40,752 --> 01:30:42,527
The way she took out the tower?

1169
01:30:44,286 --> 01:30:45,685
May be it's true.

1170
01:30:46,823 --> 01:30:48,075
I think it's true.

1171
01:30:48,697 --> 01:30:49,711
I believe it's true.

1172
01:30:50,796 --> 01:30:54,400
Steven son, you don't really
believe those rubbish thing?

1173
01:31:17,727 --> 01:31:19,851
Diana, Diana, hide in..

1174
01:31:22,217 --> 01:31:24,042
How the hell do
we get into that?

1175
01:31:24,601 --> 01:31:27,259
I see only a couple of guards
in the door to distract.

1176
01:31:27,514 --> 01:31:28,840
Yeah, it won't
look suspicious...

1177
01:31:29,041 --> 01:31:30,606
when I wanna come
sauntering out of the woods.

1178
01:31:30,607 --> 01:31:31,398
I could get in.

1179
01:31:31,574 --> 01:31:33,584
You are not going in
there, it's too dangerous.

1180
01:31:33,609 --> 01:31:35,091
- Too dangerous?
- Yes, too dangerous.

1181
01:31:35,105 --> 01:31:36,375
And you are too distracting.

1182
01:31:36,600 --> 01:31:38,652
Look, I will go in
there, follow them to..

1183
01:31:38,653 --> 01:31:41,381
Where ever they are working on
the gas or better yet, where it is.

1184
01:31:41,596 --> 01:31:43,798
- I'm coming with you.
- No, you are not coming with me.

1185
01:31:43,855 --> 01:31:45,787
What you're wearing isn't
exactly undercover.

1186
01:31:46,313 --> 01:31:46,903
I don't know.

1187
01:31:46,904 --> 01:31:49,703
I would say she was pretty
undercover on that battlefield.

1188
01:31:49,728 --> 01:31:53,236
It's just gonna, we can't get you there.
It's all scouted out, we'll put back...

1189
01:31:53,261 --> 01:31:55,063
But as long as he's still
alive, it doesn't...

1190
01:31:55,072 --> 01:31:57,459
You cannot go into German
high command and kill anyone.

1191
01:31:58,004 --> 01:31:59,813
You just can't. You
have to trust me.

1192
01:32:01,180 --> 01:32:02,737
- Oh, Wow!
- Where did that come from?

1193
01:32:02,862 --> 01:32:05,087
Oh, can I drive it?
Please let me drive it!

1194
01:32:05,162 --> 01:32:06,283
Yes, I'll be your chauffeur.

1195
01:32:06,385 --> 01:32:07,629
Come on... come on.

1196
01:32:08,107 --> 01:32:09,108
Stay put!

1197
01:32:11,054 --> 01:32:11,929
Where this come from?

1198
01:32:12,129 --> 01:32:13,610
A field over there.
It is full of them!

1199
01:32:18,125 --> 01:32:19,545
Chief, I think you and
me scope out the area...

1200
01:32:19,546 --> 01:32:21,415
in case we need to beat
the haste and retreat.

1201
01:32:21,416 --> 01:32:22,992
- What do you say, Diana?
- Huh?

1202
01:32:28,317 --> 01:32:29,318
Colonel.

1203
01:32:33,505 --> 01:32:36,020
Steve, they have invitations.

1204
01:32:37,571 --> 01:32:39,849
Don't worry. Play it cool,
you go this, you got this.

1205
01:32:43,952 --> 01:32:45,574
Your invitation, please.

1206
01:32:45,599 --> 01:32:47,785
<i>Thank you sir.</i> The
Colonel and I wish...

1207
01:32:47,810 --> 01:32:50,157
many blessings and all my
love to fall up in your head.

1208
01:32:50,408 --> 01:32:53,917
Your head must be empty. Find
the invitation, you idiot.

1209
01:32:54,217 --> 01:32:54,818
I am sorry.

1210
01:32:54,956 --> 01:32:57,558
I am so sorry, I must apologize
a thousand times, my master.

1211
01:32:58,574 --> 01:33:01,541
I made the most horrible, the
most unforgivable mistake.

1212
01:33:01,833 --> 01:33:03,859
- I lost the Colonel's invitation.
- What?

1213
01:33:04,160 --> 01:33:06,772
You saying we travelled all the
way through the mud and rain...

1214
01:33:07,065 --> 01:33:10,261
- Only for you to loose my invitation?
- No, I am a bug.

1215
01:33:10,286 --> 01:33:12,432
Not even a bug, I'm
a dung of a bug.

1216
01:33:12,457 --> 01:33:13,677
And you're right master...

1217
01:33:14,117 --> 01:33:15,474
Blessing will up on us.

1218
01:33:26,017 --> 01:33:27,375
This is ridiculous.

1219
01:33:27,609 --> 01:33:29,625
I'm not gonna be spending
my evening out here.

1220
01:33:29,713 --> 01:33:32,130
You stupid idiots!
Move your car!

1221
01:33:53,331 --> 01:33:55,218
What are you supposed to be?

1222
01:33:58,515 --> 01:34:00,389
What are you doing?

1223
01:34:25,079 --> 01:34:26,099
Excuse me.

1224
01:34:28,645 --> 01:34:30,341
I don't drink.

1225
01:34:38,468 --> 01:34:39,493
Have we met?

1226
01:34:39,518 --> 01:34:41,278
No, but I have
been watching you.

1227
01:34:42,671 --> 01:34:44,020
Following your career.

1228
01:34:45,117 --> 01:34:47,633
You are Dr... Isabel Maru.

1229
01:34:47,658 --> 01:34:50,200
The most talented chemist
in the German army.

1230
01:34:50,716 --> 01:34:52,136
I am a friend.

1231
01:35:03,210 --> 01:35:05,288
I hope I'm not causing any...

1232
01:35:07,023 --> 01:35:09,287
I know you and General
Ludendorff are...

1233
01:35:09,313 --> 01:35:10,278
very close.

1234
01:35:10,303 --> 01:35:13,823
We work well together.. Yes.

1235
01:35:14,401 --> 01:35:17,390
Tell me some one like
me behind you...

1236
01:35:18,146 --> 01:35:20,047
I could provide a lot more.

1237
01:35:20,072 --> 01:35:21,840
And who are you?

1238
01:35:22,046 --> 01:35:26,130
A man who shows you appreciation
a genius like yourself deserves.

1239
01:35:32,820 --> 01:35:35,391
I love fire. Don't you?

1240
01:35:37,783 --> 01:35:39,429
It is like...

1241
01:35:41,083 --> 01:35:43,185
a living act of entropy.

1242
01:35:43,210 --> 01:35:45,825
The ultimate weapon
of destruction.

1243
01:35:46,510 --> 01:35:48,736
Reminding us that in the end...

1244
01:35:49,408 --> 01:35:52,574
everything eventually returns
to the ash it came from.

1245
01:35:55,080 --> 01:35:58,344
There is something
reassuring about it.

1246
01:36:02,945 --> 01:36:05,058
I see all of that in your eyes.

1247
01:36:08,534 --> 01:36:10,746
Perhaps you could show me
what you're working on.

1248
01:36:26,781 --> 01:36:28,399
I hear it is...

1249
01:36:30,677 --> 01:36:32,682
I hear it is extraordinary.

1250
01:36:33,647 --> 01:36:37,271
I appreciate your
interest in my work...

1251
01:36:37,296 --> 01:36:39,652
but I'm loyal to
General Ludendorff.

1252
01:36:40,439 --> 01:36:41,460
Besides...

1253
01:36:41,485 --> 01:36:44,125
Now I see your attention is...

1254
01:36:47,602 --> 01:36:48,603
elsewhere.

1255
01:37:12,718 --> 01:37:14,639
Enjoying the party?

1256
01:37:16,662 --> 01:37:19,466
I confess I'm not sure what
it is we're celebrating.

1257
01:37:19,491 --> 01:37:22,387
A German victory, of course.

1258
01:37:22,688 --> 01:37:23,395
Victory?

1259
01:37:23,416 --> 01:37:26,117
When I hear peace
could be so close.

1260
01:37:26,312 --> 01:37:27,421
Peace?

1261
01:37:27,439 --> 01:37:29,308
It's only an armistice...

1262
01:37:29,582 --> 01:37:31,115
and an endless war.

1263
01:37:31,783 --> 01:37:33,238
Thucydides.

1264
01:37:33,645 --> 01:37:35,284
You know your ancient Greeks?

1265
01:37:35,548 --> 01:37:37,292
They understood...

1266
01:37:37,313 --> 01:37:38,756
that war was a god.

1267
01:37:39,297 --> 01:37:41,977
A god that requires
human sacrifices.

1268
01:37:42,002 --> 01:37:43,242
And in exchange...

1269
01:37:43,267 --> 01:37:46,007
war gives man purpose...

1270
01:37:46,032 --> 01:37:47,979
meaning, a chance to rise...

1271
01:37:48,004 --> 01:37:50,382
above his petty,
mortal little self...

1272
01:37:51,117 --> 01:37:52,432
and be courageous...

1273
01:37:53,255 --> 01:37:54,646
Noble!

1274
01:37:55,882 --> 01:37:59,097
Only one of the many
gods believed in that.

1275
01:38:00,094 --> 01:38:01,680
And he was wrong.

1276
01:38:02,977 --> 01:38:04,362
You know nothing of the gods.

1277
01:38:04,387 --> 01:38:05,894
<i>Herr General.</i>

1278
01:38:09,024 --> 01:38:10,578
Enjoy the fireworks.

1279
01:38:16,191 --> 01:38:17,252
What are you doing?

1280
01:38:17,277 --> 01:38:18,718
- Out of my way!
- Diana, look at me.

1281
01:38:18,848 --> 01:38:20,685
If you kill Ludendorff
before we find the gas...

1282
01:38:20,686 --> 01:38:22,097
we won't be able
to stop anything.

1283
01:38:22,098 --> 01:38:23,277
I will stop Ares!

1284
01:38:23,302 --> 01:38:24,835
What if you're wrong?

1285
01:38:26,405 --> 01:38:28,007
What if there's no Ares?

1286
01:38:29,770 --> 01:38:31,221
You don't believe me.

1287
01:38:31,323 --> 01:38:33,058
I can not let you do this.

1288
01:38:33,720 --> 01:38:35,178
What I do is not up to you.

1289
01:38:41,984 --> 01:38:43,137
Diana!

1290
01:38:47,412 --> 01:38:48,413
Diana...

1291
01:38:48,914 --> 01:38:49,915
The gas.

1292
01:38:50,922 --> 01:38:52,930
The villagers!

1293
01:38:55,100 --> 01:38:56,732
What they cheering for?

1294
01:38:59,280 --> 01:39:00,359
Diana!

1295
01:39:02,750 --> 01:39:04,358
What did they fire?

1296
01:39:04,671 --> 01:39:05,672
The gas.

1297
01:39:05,703 --> 01:39:07,743
- It was Ludendorff.
- I saw him, he was in the tower.

1298
01:39:07,744 --> 01:39:09,213
Wherever he goes you follow.

1299
01:39:10,012 --> 01:39:11,447
How will you find us?

1300
01:39:11,932 --> 01:39:13,367
I know how.

1301
01:40:31,176 --> 01:40:32,524
Diana!

1302
01:40:35,519 --> 01:40:38,181
They are dead.
They are all dead.

1303
01:40:39,097 --> 01:40:40,748
I could have saved them.

1304
01:40:41,078 --> 01:40:43,421
I could have saved them
if it weren't for you.

1305
01:40:43,663 --> 01:40:45,639
You stopped me
from killing Ares!

1306
01:40:45,840 --> 01:40:48,228
- No!
- Get away from me!

1307
01:40:48,423 --> 01:40:49,920
I understand everything now.

1308
01:40:49,945 --> 01:40:51,731
It isn't just the Germans
that Ares has corrupted.

1309
01:40:51,732 --> 01:40:53,049
It's you too.

1310
01:40:53,735 --> 01:40:54,762
All of you.

1311
01:40:55,957 --> 01:40:57,263
I'll find Ares...

1312
01:40:57,484 --> 01:40:59,048
and I'll kill him.

1313
01:41:02,369 --> 01:41:03,504
Diana!

1314
01:41:04,547 --> 01:41:05,655
That smoke...

1315
01:41:06,792 --> 01:41:07,794
it's the chief!

1316
01:41:07,815 --> 01:41:09,262
He followed Ludendorff.

1317
01:41:10,753 --> 01:41:12,336
Follow the smoke!

1318
01:41:38,652 --> 01:41:40,351
Hey! Diana, Over there!

1319
01:41:56,767 --> 01:41:57,968
Come on. Let's go!

1320
01:42:20,048 --> 01:42:21,658
Ooh! What a surprise.

1321
01:42:22,284 --> 01:42:23,576
Strange.

1322
01:42:24,955 --> 01:42:27,060
Unfortunately, I have
another matter...

1323
01:42:28,118 --> 01:42:29,119
to attend to.

1324
01:42:34,182 --> 01:42:36,787
What are you?

1325
01:42:36,788 --> 01:42:38,027
You will soon find out.

1326
01:43:12,232 --> 01:43:16,349
As magnificent as you are, you
are still no match for me.

1327
01:43:20,200 --> 01:43:22,183
We'll see about that.

1328
01:43:46,538 --> 01:43:48,521
I am Diana Temiscira...

1329
01:43:50,426 --> 01:43:52,283
daughter of Hippolyta...

1330
01:43:53,302 --> 01:43:55,688
Queen of the Amazons.

1331
01:43:58,411 --> 01:44:01,159
And your wrath upon
this world is over.

1332
01:44:18,644 --> 01:44:21,143
In the name of all that it
is good in this world...

1333
01:44:21,394 --> 01:44:23,995
I hereby complete the
mission of the Amazons...

1334
01:44:24,281 --> 01:44:26,083
by ridding this world of you...

1335
01:44:26,338 --> 01:44:27,340
forever!

1336
01:45:34,907 --> 01:45:35,908
Diana?

1337
01:45:41,645 --> 01:45:42,646
Diana!

1338
01:45:46,922 --> 01:45:48,461
I killed him.

1339
01:45:50,090 --> 01:45:52,280
I killed him, but nothing stops.

1340
01:45:53,727 --> 01:45:56,401
You kill the god of
war, you stop the war.

1341
01:45:56,677 --> 01:45:58,667
Exactly what we have to do now.

1342
01:45:58,849 --> 01:46:00,250
We need to stop the gas.
Come on.

1343
01:46:00,463 --> 01:46:01,924
No. All this should
have stopped.

1344
01:46:02,033 --> 01:46:02,981
Diana...

1345
01:46:03,025 --> 01:46:05,012
The fighting should have stopped.
Why are they?

1346
01:46:05,013 --> 01:46:07,088
I don't know! I don't know.

1347
01:46:07,309 --> 01:46:08,171
Ares is dead.

1348
01:46:08,410 --> 01:46:11,402
They can now stop fighting.
Why are they still fighting?

1349
01:46:11,610 --> 01:46:13,303
Because maybe it's them!

1350
01:46:13,723 --> 01:46:14,724
Maybe...

1351
01:46:16,560 --> 01:46:19,115
Maybe people aren't always good.

1352
01:46:20,188 --> 01:46:22,036
Ares or no Ares...

1353
01:46:23,338 --> 01:46:26,653
Maybe it's just, who they are.

1354
01:46:29,589 --> 01:46:30,880
- Diana...
- No.

1355
01:46:31,211 --> 01:46:32,663
Diana, we can talk
about this later.

1356
01:46:32,868 --> 01:46:34,207
- I need you to come with me.
- No, no!

1357
01:46:34,208 --> 01:46:35,973
After everything I
saw, it can't be!

1358
01:46:36,197 --> 01:46:37,404
Can not be!

1359
01:46:37,854 --> 01:46:39,935
They were killing each other.

1360
01:46:40,187 --> 01:46:42,718
Killing people they cannot see.
Children...

1361
01:46:42,998 --> 01:46:44,584
Children!

1362
01:46:44,819 --> 01:46:47,165
No, it had to be him.
It can not be them!

1363
01:46:47,413 --> 01:46:49,740
Diana, people... I...

1364
01:46:49,998 --> 01:46:51,542
She was right.

1365
01:46:52,069 --> 01:46:53,078
My mother was right.

1366
01:46:53,079 --> 01:46:55,124
She said the world of
men do not deserve you.

1367
01:46:55,326 --> 01:46:57,020
They don't deserve
our help, Steve.

1368
01:46:57,266 --> 01:46:59,823
- It's not about deserve!
- They do not deserve our help.

1369
01:46:59,848 --> 01:47:01,718
Maybe we don't!

1370
01:47:03,379 --> 01:47:05,547
But it's not about that.
It's about what you believe.

1371
01:47:06,544 --> 01:47:09,358
You don't think I get it, after
what I've seen out there?

1372
01:47:10,843 --> 01:47:14,325
You don't think I wish I could tell
you that I was one bad guy to blame?

1373
01:47:14,956 --> 01:47:16,630
It's not!

1374
01:47:18,801 --> 01:47:20,481
We are all to blame.

1375
01:47:20,755 --> 01:47:21,756
I am not.

1376
01:47:23,365 --> 01:47:24,967
But maybe I am!

1377
01:47:28,844 --> 01:47:29,845
Please.

1378
01:47:30,206 --> 01:47:32,065
If you believe that
this war should stop...

1379
01:47:32,066 --> 01:47:33,882
if you want to stop it...

1380
01:47:34,214 --> 01:47:35,655
help me stop it right now.

1381
01:47:35,663 --> 01:47:36,964
Because... if.

1382
01:47:38,363 --> 01:47:43,668
If you don't, there will be thousands more.
Please, please come with me.

1383
01:47:43,693 --> 01:47:45,176
I have to go.

1384
01:47:51,697 --> 01:47:53,310
I have to go.

1385
01:48:05,133 --> 01:48:06,169
Hey!

1386
01:48:10,702 --> 01:48:12,017
- Where is Diana?
- We are on our own.

1387
01:48:12,160 --> 01:48:14,972
- What?
- What did you see, Charlie?

1388
01:48:15,412 --> 01:48:16,999
Seems like a bunch
of gas pumps...

1389
01:48:17,261 --> 01:48:19,595
but I can't see where
they're taking them.

1390
01:48:19,632 --> 01:48:21,232
How are we gonna get in there?

1391
01:48:21,963 --> 01:48:24,066
I have got an idea.
Come on guys.

1392
01:48:24,295 --> 01:48:25,296
Come on!

1393
01:48:38,897 --> 01:48:40,642
Who's there?

1394
01:48:53,115 --> 01:48:55,025
Sir Patrick.

1395
01:48:55,734 --> 01:49:00,065
You were right, Diana. They
don't deserve our help.

1396
01:49:01,228 --> 01:49:05,093
They only deserve destruction.

1397
01:49:06,456 --> 01:49:07,924
You...

1398
01:49:09,598 --> 01:49:11,557
You are him.

1399
01:49:15,025 --> 01:49:16,429
I am.

1400
01:49:16,816 --> 01:49:21,442
But I'm not what
you thought I was.

1401
01:49:42,086 --> 01:49:43,651
What is that?

1402
01:49:44,944 --> 01:49:46,262
Future.

1403
01:49:50,977 --> 01:49:52,983
I'm not your enemy, Diana.

1404
01:49:55,013 --> 01:49:58,752
I'm the only one who
truly knows you.

1405
01:49:58,987 --> 01:50:03,511
And who truly knows
them, as you now do.

1406
01:50:05,826 --> 01:50:09,497
They always been and
always will be...

1407
01:50:09,677 --> 01:50:13,638
weak, cruel, selfish...

1408
01:50:13,738 --> 01:50:17,012
and capable of the
greatest horrors.

1409
01:50:26,298 --> 01:50:27,748
All I ever wanted was...

1410
01:50:27,749 --> 01:50:32,808
for the Gods to see how
evil my father's creation was.

1411
01:50:34,785 --> 01:50:35,930
But they refused.

1412
01:50:36,256 --> 01:50:37,497
I am Diana of Temiscira...

1413
01:50:37,658 --> 01:50:39,156
So I destroyed them.

1414
01:50:39,190 --> 01:50:41,189
Daughter of Hippolyta...

1415
01:50:41,227 --> 01:50:43,259
and I am here to complete her...

1416
01:50:51,232 --> 01:50:52,863
The God Killer...

1417
01:50:55,562 --> 01:50:57,584
My dear Child..

1418
01:50:58,911 --> 01:51:01,433
That's not the God Killer.

1419
01:51:03,927 --> 01:51:05,428
You are.

1420
01:51:08,017 --> 01:51:11,155
Only a God can kill another God.

1421
01:51:12,199 --> 01:51:16,096
Zeus left the child he had
with the queen of the Amazon.

1422
01:51:16,323 --> 01:51:18,596
As a weapon to use against me.

1423
01:51:18,621 --> 01:51:20,494
No. You liar.

1424
01:51:22,278 --> 01:51:24,591
I compel you to
tell me the truth.

1425
01:51:26,894 --> 01:51:28,381
I am.

1426
01:51:54,785 --> 01:51:57,131
I'm not the god of war, Diana.

1427
01:51:57,339 --> 01:51:59,807
I am the God of truth.

1428
01:52:01,340 --> 01:52:02,663
Mankind...

1429
01:52:03,297 --> 01:52:06,314
Stole this world from us.

1430
01:52:08,322 --> 01:52:11,818
They ruined it, day by day.

1431
01:52:11,819 --> 01:52:16,095
And I, the only one wise
enough to see it...

1432
01:52:17,551 --> 01:52:20,317
was left too weak to stop them.

1433
01:52:21,244 --> 01:52:24,870
All these years I have
struggled alone...

1434
01:52:24,871 --> 01:52:27,023
whispering into their ears.

1435
01:52:27,024 --> 01:52:31,843
Ideas, inspiration
for formulas...

1436
01:52:32,757 --> 01:52:34,353
weapons...

1437
01:52:37,015 --> 01:52:39,552
but I don't make them use them.

1438
01:52:40,611 --> 01:52:42,560
They start these
wars on their own.

1439
01:52:43,556 --> 01:52:47,374
All I do is orchestrate an armistice
I know they cannot keep...

1440
01:52:47,648 --> 01:52:49,893
in the hope they will
destroy themselves.

1441
01:52:51,951 --> 01:52:54,047
But it has never been enough.

1442
01:52:55,485 --> 01:52:56,584
Until you.

1443
01:52:59,234 --> 01:53:03,488
When you first arrived I
was going to crush you.

1444
01:53:04,066 --> 01:53:07,198
But I knew that if
only you could see...

1445
01:53:07,403 --> 01:53:11,275
what the other gods could not...

1446
01:53:12,649 --> 01:53:17,162
then you would join me, and
with our powers combined...

1447
01:53:17,435 --> 01:53:21,367
we could finally end all the
pain, all the suffering...

1448
01:53:21,588 --> 01:53:24,153
destruction they bring.

1449
01:53:24,606 --> 01:53:29,739
And we could return this world to
the paradise it was before them.

1450
01:53:31,343 --> 01:53:33,073
Forever.

1451
01:53:35,964 --> 01:53:37,447
I...

1452
01:53:42,243 --> 01:53:44,977
I can never be a part of that.

1453
01:53:48,099 --> 01:53:50,875
My dear, I don't
want to fight you.

1454
01:53:51,982 --> 01:53:53,255
But if I must...

1455
01:54:02,848 --> 01:54:04,703
- Steve!
- Come on, let's go!

1456
01:54:05,212 --> 01:54:06,476
Sammy, let's go!

1457
01:54:06,916 --> 01:54:08,404
Get these things out of here.

1458
01:54:38,339 --> 01:54:42,783
Oh my dear, you have
so much to learn.

1459
01:55:07,813 --> 01:55:10,298
Oh my God!

1460
01:55:10,771 --> 01:55:12,199
What are we gonna do?

1461
01:55:13,957 --> 01:55:16,050
There is not much we can do...

1462
01:55:16,197 --> 01:55:17,826
if that's who I think it is.

1463
01:55:23,111 --> 01:55:25,050
But we can stop that plane.

1464
01:55:38,256 --> 01:55:40,152
If we could get on the radio...

1465
01:55:40,153 --> 01:55:42,738
we can ask flying
corp to shoot her down.

1466
01:55:42,763 --> 01:55:46,039
No. If it crashes, it will wipe
everyone out for 50 square miles.

1467
01:55:46,064 --> 01:55:46,983
We gotta ground it!

1468
01:55:47,208 --> 01:55:48,799
Bad news. It's on a timer.

1469
01:55:49,101 --> 01:55:51,259
If we ground it here,
it's the same thing.

1470
01:55:58,293 --> 01:56:00,236
Is it flammable, Chief?

1471
01:56:00,261 --> 01:56:03,739
Yes, you said it's hydrogen.
It's flammable.

1472
01:56:10,880 --> 01:56:13,310
I need you guys to clear
me a path to that plane.

1473
01:56:13,335 --> 01:56:15,487
- No, Steve!
- Hey, Steve!

1474
01:56:17,509 --> 01:56:18,510
Come on!

1475
01:57:01,124 --> 01:57:03,548
Come on! This way! Steve!

1476
01:57:13,114 --> 01:57:14,961
- Come on, Steve.
- Ahead! Go!

1477
01:57:15,375 --> 01:57:16,849
Steve!

1478
01:57:59,767 --> 01:58:02,893
Let's see what kind of
god you really are.

1479
01:58:29,353 --> 01:58:32,697
You will help me
destroy them, Diana.

1480
01:58:36,005 --> 01:58:37,761
Or you will die.

1481
01:58:47,824 --> 01:58:50,176
Come on! Let's move, let's go!
Go. Go. Go.

1482
01:58:53,358 --> 01:58:55,356
- Now!
- Go! Run!

1483
01:59:20,416 --> 01:59:23,161
Is that all you have to offer?

1484
01:59:39,457 --> 01:59:43,378
It is futile to
imagine you can win.

1485
01:59:44,215 --> 01:59:45,924
Give up, Diana.

1486
01:59:49,952 --> 01:59:51,614
Chief! Anything left?

1487
01:59:51,639 --> 01:59:52,574
I got nothing.

1488
01:59:52,599 --> 01:59:53,905
- Anything!
- No!

1489
02:00:11,745 --> 02:00:12,746
Steve.

1490
02:00:59,221 --> 02:01:00,673
Steve.

1491
02:01:03,722 --> 02:01:07,571
No!

1492
02:01:40,791 --> 02:01:43,393
Yes, Diana!

1493
02:01:43,795 --> 02:01:46,361
Take them all!

1494
02:01:46,706 --> 02:01:49,792
Finally you see.

1495
02:01:50,216 --> 02:01:52,791
Look at this world.

1496
02:01:53,090 --> 02:01:55,906
Mankind did this, not me.

1497
02:01:57,691 --> 02:01:59,764
They are ugly...

1498
02:01:59,789 --> 02:02:01,603
filled with hatred...

1499
02:02:01,904 --> 02:02:02,987
weak...

1500
02:02:03,388 --> 02:02:06,112
Just like your captain Trevor.

1501
02:02:06,680 --> 02:02:12,394
Gone and left you nothing.
And for what?

1502
02:02:12,781 --> 02:02:14,366
Pathetic!

1503
02:02:15,740 --> 02:02:17,483
He deserved to burn!

1504
02:02:28,493 --> 02:02:32,629
Look at her and
tell me I'm wrong.

1505
02:02:41,036 --> 02:02:45,035
She is the perfect example
of these humans...

1506
02:02:46,791 --> 02:02:50,698
and unworthy of your
sympathy in every way.

1507
02:02:52,202 --> 02:02:54,349
Destroy her, Diana.

1508
02:02:55,432 --> 02:02:58,791
You know that she deserves.
That they all do.

1509
02:03:02,013 --> 02:03:03,374
Do it!

1510
02:03:08,182 --> 02:03:09,884
Diana!

1511
02:03:13,093 --> 02:03:14,527
Diana...

1512
02:03:24,057 --> 02:03:25,058
What?

1513
02:03:25,558 --> 02:03:27,162
We have to go.

1514
02:03:29,908 --> 02:03:31,401
What are you saying?

1515
02:03:31,967 --> 02:03:33,013
Steve...

1516
02:03:33,845 --> 02:03:35,977
Whatever it is, I can do it.

1517
02:03:36,303 --> 02:03:37,151
No.. No..

1518
02:03:37,278 --> 02:03:38,667
- Let me do it.
- No.

1519
02:03:38,892 --> 02:03:40,544
It has to be me.

1520
02:03:40,569 --> 02:03:42,223
It has to be me.

1521
02:03:42,543 --> 02:03:45,791
I could save today. You
can save the world.

1522
02:03:54,609 --> 02:03:57,049
I wish we had more time.

1523
02:03:57,294 --> 02:04:00,073
What? What are you saying?

1524
02:04:02,981 --> 02:04:03,982
I love you!

1525
02:04:15,924 --> 02:04:17,407
You are wrong about them.

1526
02:04:27,179 --> 02:04:28,842
They are everything you say...

1527
02:04:29,710 --> 02:04:31,299
but so much more.

1528
02:04:31,569 --> 02:04:32,866
Lies!

1529
02:04:59,112 --> 02:05:02,742
They do not deserve
your protection!

1530
02:05:04,518 --> 02:05:05,605
It's not about deserving.

1531
02:05:10,480 --> 02:05:12,384
It's about what you believe.

1532
02:05:16,020 --> 02:05:17,400
And I believe in love.

1533
02:05:17,434 --> 02:05:22,681
Then I will destroy you!

1534
02:05:49,899 --> 02:05:51,628
<i>Goodbye brother.</i>

1535
02:09:23,796 --> 02:09:26,189
<i>I used to want to
save the world.</i>

1536
02:09:27,278 --> 02:09:31,019
<i>To end war and bring
peace to mankind.</i>

1537
02:09:31,773 --> 02:09:35,648
<i>But then I glimpsed the darkness
that lives within their mind</i>

1538
02:09:36,497 --> 02:09:38,762
<i>and learned that inside
every one of them...</i>

1539
02:09:39,477 --> 02:09:41,763
<i>there will always be both.</i>

1540
02:09:42,469 --> 02:09:45,325
<i>A choice each must
make for themselves.</i>

1541
02:09:45,592 --> 02:09:49,021
<i>Something no hero
will ever defeat..</i>

1542
02:09:50,367 --> 02:09:51,611
<i>And now I know...</i>

1543
02:09:52,783 --> 02:09:57,326
<i>that only love can
truly save the world.</i>

1544
02:09:59,048 --> 02:10:00,751
<i>So I stay...</i>

1545
02:10:01,018 --> 02:10:03,172
<i>I fight and I give...</i>

1546
02:10:06,160 --> 02:10:08,136
<i>for the world I know can be.</i>

1547
02:10:12,712 --> 02:10:14,380
<i>This is my mission now.</i>

1548
02:10:17,251 --> 02:10:18,594
<i>Forever.</i>
