1
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,040
"The movie will begin
in five moments"...

2
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:36,120
the mindless voice announced.

3
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:40,600
"All those unseated
will await the next show."

4
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:44,960
We filed slowly, languidly
into the hall.

5
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:49,040
The auditorium was vast and silent.

6
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:53,400
As we seated and were darkened,
the voice continued.

7
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:57,120
"The program for this evening
is not new.

8
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,600
You've seen this entertainment
through and through.

9
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,680
You've seen your birth,
your life and death.

10
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,240
You might recall all of the rest.

11
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,840
Did you have a good world
when you died?

12
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,440
Enough to base a movie on?"

13
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:12,360
Hey, Jim, it's your birthday, man.

14
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,840
What do you say
we finish this another night?

15
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:20,560
Turn the lights down a little bit more,
will you, Jay?

16
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:31,040
Hey, man.
How come the Doors aren't in on this?

17
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:35,800
No music. No Doors.
Come on, let's roll.

18
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,880
Rolling.

19
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:56,200
Is everybody in?

20
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:05,160
The ceremony is about to begin.

21
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,200
Let me tell you about heartache...

22
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,600
and the loss of God.

23
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:18,600
Wandering, wandering in hopeless night.

24
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:23,120
Out here, in the perimeter,
there are no stars.

25
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:27,520
Out here, we is stoned, immaculate.

26
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:34,760
It's beautiful.
Look at those big, puffy clouds.

27
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:38,720
Hey, Jimmy.
Wake up. Look at the clouds.

28
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,360
Come on.
Wake up.

29
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,560
What's going on?

30
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,720
I don't know.

31
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:07,320
Officer, what happened?
Can we help?

32
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,400
No, sir.
We've got everything under control.

33
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,040
Just a dream, Jimmy.

34
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:27,080
That's all it is.
It's just a dream

35
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,640
Waiting for the medicine.

36
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,080
On your finger.

37
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,640
Wait here.
Don't go.

38
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,160
I'll be right here.

39
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,960
You got a problem with doors?

40
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,880
Waste of time.

41
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,120
I followed you from the beach.

42
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,720
You followed me?

43
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,040
- Why?
- 'Cause...

44
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,960
you're the one.

45
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,720
Maybe you should meet my old man.

46
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,600
What's your name?

47
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,320
- Mine's Jim.
- Pam.

48
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,720
Who the hell was that?

49
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:19,240
I have no idea.

50
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,000
Nietzsche said...

51
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:26,120
"All great things must first wear
terrifying and monstrous masks...

52
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:29,040
in order to inscribe themselves...

53
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:31,680
on the hearts of humanity."

54
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,400
Listen, children...

55
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:36,840
to the sound of the Nuremberg night.

56
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,120
In a seance...

57
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:42,840
the shaman leads a sensuous panic.

58
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:48,200
He acts like a madman.
A professional hysteria.

59
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:50,680
Have you ever seen God?

60
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,320
Mandala?

61
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,880
A symmetrical angel.

62
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,880
We got our final vision by clap.

63
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,960
Columbus' groin got filled
with green death.

64
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:04,040
- I touched her thigh...
- This film is weak.

65
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,560
and death smiled.

66
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,640
Hey, Morrison.
Fuck them, man.

67
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,920
It's great.
It's nonlinear, it's poetry.

68
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,760
It's everything good art stands for.

69
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:19,640
This world, a monster of energy.

70
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,080
Without beginning,
Without end.

71
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,720
Likewise, without increase or income.

72
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,440
Disclosing nothing.

73
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,360
This world.

74
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,120
This world is a will to power...

75
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,480
and nothing besides.

76
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,040
Pretty pretentious there.

77
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,720
Not easy to follow.
A little incoherent.

78
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:46,520
Dancing bears, Nazism, masturbation.

79
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,000
What's next?

80
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,360
- What do you guys think?
- A bore, man. I hated it.

81
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,800
It was better than a Warhol picture!

82
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,160
It was worse!

83
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,760
A guy sleeping for seven hours?

84
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:58,360
There was no political conscience.

85
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,760
- You need your art spoon-fed to you.
- Right on!

86
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:06,760
Hold it down.
Let's ask the filmmaker what he thinks.

87
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,560
I quit.

88
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,920
Awake.

89
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,880
Shake dreams from your hair,
my pretty child, my sweet one.

90
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:42,360
Choose the day
and choose the sign of your day.

91
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,080
The day's divinity.
First thing I see.

92
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,560
Come on out for a walk.

93
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,440
It's a beautiful night.

94
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,560
A vast, radiant beach...

95
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:56,960
and a cool, jeweled moon.

96
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:02,120
Couples, naked,
race down by its quiet side.

97
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:05,080
And we laugh like soft, mad children...

98
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,440
smug in the woolly,
cotton brains of infancy.

99
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:12,440
Every time
I try to make love to you

100
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:16,920
you run around
with your mouth stuck out

101
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:20,920
Choose, they croon, the ancient ones.
The time has come again.

102
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,720
Choose now, they croon,
beneath the moon...

103
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,160
beside an ancient lake.

104
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,360
Enter again the sweet forest.

105
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:31,160
Enter the hot dream.
Come with us.

106
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,720
Everything is broken up...

107
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,000
and dances.

108
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,960
I can't believe it's so beautiful.

109
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:44,760
"Now I have come again to the land
of the fair, strong and the wise.

110
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,000
Brothers and sisters
o'er the pale forest.

111
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,880
O, children of night...

112
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,520
who among you will run with the hunt?

113
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,000
Now, night arrives with
her purple legion.

114
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:57,280
Retire now to your tents and dreams.

115
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,040
Tomorrow we enter
the town of my birth.

116
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,120
I want to be ready."

117
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,320
It's beautiful.

118
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:09,320
- Do you like that?
- It's beautiful.

119
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:12,200
I've never read much poetry before.

120
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,000
What's a shaman?

121
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,520
He's a medicine man...

122
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,120
of the Indians.

123
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:27,840
He gets into a peyote trance...

124
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:32,760
and he gets deeper and deeper,
and then he has a vision...

125
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,160
and the whole tribe is healed.

126
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:39,120
All cultures have a version of it.

127
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:41,320
Greeks had theater and gods.

128
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,480
The Indians say the first shaman
invented sex.

129
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,800
They called him
"The One Who Makes You Crazy."

130
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,960
What turns you on?

131
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,000
I don't know.

132
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:59,920
Experience.

133
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,160
Freedom.

134
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:05,480
Love. Now.

135
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:09,040
You know, the first time I did acid,
I saw God.

136
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:12,800
And I saw a friend of mine
who was Christ and Judas too.

137
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,000
Then I realized that...

138
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,960
that was the secret of everything.

139
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:21,080
We're all one,
the universe is one...

140
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,360
and that everything is beautiful.

141
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:31,040
I feel most alive...

142
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,960
confronting death...

143
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,520
experiencing pain.

144
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,280
I think you're most alive
by recognizing beauty.

145
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,200
Seeing truth.

146
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,920
Does death turn you on?

147
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,840
You love death?

148
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,280
Life hurts a lot more.

149
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,600
When you die, the pain's over.

150
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:06,640
All the poems have wolves in it.

151
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,840
All but one.

152
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,480
The most beautiful one of all.

153
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:17,400
"She dances in a ring of fire...

154
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,560
and throws off the challenge
with a shrug."

155
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,400
That's beautiful.

156
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:29,680
Who did you write that for?

157
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:32,000
I wrote it for you.

158
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,440
Try acid, Ray.

159
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,960
It's guaranteed.

160
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,920
Shit, Morrison.

161
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,200
My last trip was a real bummer, man.

162
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,560
I never had a bummer on acid.

163
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,440
I'm trying naturally high now.

164
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,280
Whatever works.

165
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,280
Making movies at MGM yet?

166
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:25,000
I got in to see the head of production.

167
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:27,560
He said, "Where's your script?"
I said, "I don't need a script.

168
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:30,040
Godard doesn't use a script.
He improvises."

169
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,960
The guy says, "Great. Who's Godard?"

170
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,880
I'm off movies, man.

171
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:39,400
I went out to the desert.
Got lost.

172
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,800
I've been living up on Trick's rooftop.

173
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:47,200
- Got stuck on a chick.
- So what else you doing?

174
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:51,040
Writing songs, poems.
Stuff like that.

175
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,040
You're writing songs?

176
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,560
So let me hear one.

177
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,920
I'm shy.

178
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,200
- Sing it to me.
- I can't sing.

179
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,400
You sing better than Dylan?

180
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,840
Johnny's in the basement

181
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:05,400
Mixing up the medicine
I'm on the pavement

182
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,760
Thinking about the government

183
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,120
Let me hear your words.

184
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:17,480
All right.

185
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:23,800
Let's swim to the moon

186
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:27,320
Let's climb through the tide

187
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:32,080
Penetrate the evening

188
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:36,880
That the city sleeps to hide

189
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:43,440
Let's swim out tonight, love

190
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:47,600
It's our turn to try

191
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:52,720
Park beside the ocean

192
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:55,120
On our

193
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:58,280
Moonlight drive

194
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:09,520
Those are great fucking lyrics, man.

195
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:13,080
- Yeah?
- Yeah. You write this?

196
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:15,360
You got others in here?

197
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,920
A bunch, man.
I got a whole concert in my head.

198
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,680
I can see it all.

199
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,640
What the hell happened to you
in the desert, man?

200
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,160
- Ecstasy and madness.
- Let's get a band together...

201
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,920
and make a million bucks!

202
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,320
- I got tons of songs.
- Things are about to explode.

203
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,160
I can feel it in the air.
People want to fight or fuck.

204
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,800
Love or kill.
Vietnam is right out there.

205
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,720
Sides are being chosen.

206
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:38,160
Everything's gonna flame.
The planet is screaming for change.

207
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,080
We gotta make the myths.

208
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:42,080
There ought to be great orgies, man.

209
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:45,680
When Dionysus arrived in Greece,
he made all the women mad.

210
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:48,680
Leaving their homes
and dancing off into the mountains.

211
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,240
There should be great, golden
copulations in the streets of L.A.

212
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,560
We should call ourselves Dionysus.

213
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,960
I got a name.
Doors.

214
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,520
You mean "The Doors In Your Mind"?
The Huxley book?

215
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,600
- Doors of perception. Acid.
- That's great.

216
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,520
The quote's from William Blake.

217
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,720
"When the doors of perception
are cleansed...

218
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,640
things will appear
as they truly are."

219
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:09,240
Mescaline experiments.
Reducing the sugar flow to the brain.

220
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:09,320
Come on!

221
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,160
Come on!

222
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:24,080
You know the day destroys the night

223
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:26,120
Night divides the day

224
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:28,440
Try to run

225
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,960
Try to hide

226
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:32,840
Break on through to the other side

227
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,720
What's the matter?

228
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,600
- It just doesn't sound right.
- I know that, John.

229
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,600
Jim, stay in time.

230
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,120
I say we try that bossa nova beat.

231
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,080
I think it's hot.

232
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,680
I think the lyrics are kind of weird.

233
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,240
You write one, man.

234
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:00,760
We need more songs anyway.

235
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:03,000
I thought it was pretty good.

236
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:05,400
Let's go outside.

237
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,320
I came up with something.

238
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:23,960
A minor, then F sharp.

239
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:33,840
You know that it would be untrue

240
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:37,280
You know that I would be a liar

241
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:41,160
If I was to say to you

242
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:44,640
Girl, we couldn't get much higher

243
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:48,200
Come on, baby, light my fire

244
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:51,440
- G, A, D.
- Pretty good. Pretty neat.

245
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:54,640
Try to set the night on fire

246
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,560
Great, Robby.
You got nice changes in there.

247
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,560
- Got anymore lyrics?
- I got some.

248
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,200
I call it "Light My Fire."

249
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:05,720
If I'm gonna compete with your stuff, it
better be about earth, snakes or fire.

250
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:08,480
I like it.
Sounds like the Byrds though.

251
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,960
But I like it.
It's good.

252
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,680
A little Latin beat'll
do it some justice.

253
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:16,880
Maybe put a couple long solos,
like Coltrane on "My Favorite Things."

254
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:19,560
Start over, man.

255
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:22,320
A minor, B minor.
It's jazz.

256
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:24,480
The time to hesitate is through

257
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:29,080
- Some kind of intro.
- No time to wallow in the mire

258
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:32,200
Try now, we can only lose

259
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:36,000
And our love becomes a funeral pyre

260
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:39,280
Come on baby, light my fire

261
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:46,360
Try to set the night on fire

262
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,800
- Can you give me...
- Try now, we can only lose

263
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:55,320
Can you give me five minutes?
I got to figure out some kind of intro.

264
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:58,120
- Let's let him work. You like that?
- Yeah, I like Laguna Beach, man.

265
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,240
Funeral pyre.

266
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,760
What do you think about when you play?

267
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,440
I don't know.

268
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,400
Fish in my fish tank.

269
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:17,520
- How about that acid tonight, man?
- Not for me.

270
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:20,320
- Not me, either.
- Right here at Ray's house.

271
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,600
See what kind of trouble
we can get into tonight.

272
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,600
No way.
You always get all the chicks.

273
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,040
I always get the dogs.

274
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,920
Hey, I got it!
Come on!

275
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,280
I got it!
I got the intro!

276
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:32,280
Hang on a second.
John, count off in four, man.

277
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:33,760
One, two, three.

278
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:02,040
Is that horny fucker
in the black pants here tonight?

279
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,360
No I.D. 's, you can't get in.

280
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:14,040
Yeah, we chased our pleasures here

281
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:16,200
Dug our treasures there

282
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:18,960
Can't you still recall
The time we tried

283
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:21,920
Break on through to the other side

284
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:43,240
Turn around, man.
Come on, let them in.

285
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:46,080
I found an island in your arms

286
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:48,640
A country in your eyes

287
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,280
Arms that chain us
Eyes that lie

288
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:53,560
Break on through to the other side

289
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:00,120
All right

290
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:05,840
I'm a big fan!
Give it to me!

291
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,200
Made the scene

292
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,560
Week to week

293
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,840
Day to day
Hour to hour

294
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:13,720
The gate is straight
Deep and wide

295
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,920
Break on through to the other side

296
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:27,240
All right

297
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:28,800
Hi, Jim.
Can I have your autograph?

298
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:31,920
Hi, Jim.
Can I have your autograph?

299
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:34,520
- I don't know. Where do you want it?
- Anywhere you want it.

300
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,480
Leave it to me.
I can take you all the fucking way.

301
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,760
- You blew my mind.
- Did you like the music?

302
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,880
I loved it.
That's why we're talking.

303
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,400
Some of it's on the dark side.
You ought to get some tunes.

304
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:46,120
Herman's Hermits stuff.
Mrs. Brown, you've got a lovely daughter

305
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,720
That shit goes right to the radio.

306
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:50,640
I need him here
to groove on my boyfriend.

307
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,160
What about getting us
some real equipment?

308
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,920
I sign you
to a five-year management contract...

309
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,880
You with the joint.
Put that out, please.

310
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:00,360
- We can smell that upstairs.
- I can get you there.

311
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:02,160
Trust me for a while.
What do you say?

312
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,800
We'll have a band meeting on it.

313
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:07,800
We do everything unanimously
or we don't do it.

314
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,080
The Musketeers.

315
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:11,200
I'm touched.

316
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:13,680
Let me tell you something.
Loyalty don't pay the bills.

317
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:17,440
Think about it and call me tomorrow.
Here's my card.

318
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:24,680
Pay attention.
You could get rich.

319
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:26,960
- Are you blind?
- How old are you?

320
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,320
- Twenty-one.
- Get lost, will you?

321
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:35,360
I'll make this quick and to the point.
If you repeat it, I'll deny it.

322
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,840
Drop those guys.

323
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:39,400
Jim's got to start facing the crowd
if he's going to be our front man.

324
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,800
He's just getting his confidence.

325
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:44,200
- The guy never does what's rehearsed...
- Well, how does it feel?

326
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:45,520
It feels great, but...

327
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:48,200
Your looks. Your voice.
That's what's going to sell records.

328
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:49,840
We'll make a million bucks a year.

329
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,480
Call me.
I'm right.

330
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:53,840
Hey, man, let's go.

331
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:56,560
Do yourself a favor.
Call Larry.

332
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:59,040
I like a guy
who wears his soul on his face.

333
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:02,880
Whisky's next, man.
I can feel it in my bones.

334
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,000
I still think the lyrics are weird.

335
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:08,160
The days are bright

336
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:11,280
And filled with pain

337
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:16,560
Enclose me in your gentle rain

338
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:20,600
The time you ran

339
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:25,040
Was too insane

340
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:27,280
We'll meet again

341
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,280
The chicks are really
digging you tonight, man.

342
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,000
We still got to deepen, man.

343
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:36,400
- We got to go one more step.
- Turn around and face the crowd.

344
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:37,880
It'll help present it better.

345
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,640
I got to go to the desert
and take that peyote.

346
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,240
Is that what you're on?

347
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:43,360
Yeah, man.
It's kicking in!

348
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,160
- Fucking longhair!
- He's fucking crazy.

349
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,720
- Come on.
- I'm not doing acid, man.

350
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,840
It's peyote.

351
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:53,720
What's a rock and roll band for?

352
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:56,600
Let's plan a murder or start a religion.

353
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,800
More, more, more!

354
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,200
I'm into T.M., man.
I promised my guru.

355
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:03,200
I'll try it.
I'm ready.

356
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:04,440
Let's go to the desert.

357
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:06,360
Let's do the peyote.

358
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:10,200
Who's on next?

359
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,520
Arthur Lee.
He's cool.

360
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:17,360
I am the lizard king!

361
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,320
I can do anything!

362
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:22,440
Raise your hands if you understand.

363
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:27,720
Let's take a poll.
How many of you know you're alive?

364
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:30,360
Bullshit!

365
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,640
You're plastic soldiers
in a miniature dirt war.

366
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,960
Come on!

367
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:38,840
How many of you people
know you're alive?

368
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:20,640
Close your eyes.

369
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,360
You see the snake.

370
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,880
See the serpent appear?

371
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,160
His head is ten feet long...

372
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:29,320
and five feet wide.

373
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,400
He has one red eye and one green eye.

374
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:34,240
That's all right.
It gets better.

375
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,800
Peace.

376
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,840
Seven miles long.

377
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,440
Deadly.

378
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:50,440
See it.
All the history of the world...

379
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:52,880
is on its scales.

380
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:55,120
All people.
All actions.

381
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:58,920
We're all just little pictures
in the scales.

382
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:03,800
God, it's big.

383
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,880
It's moving.

384
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:11,000
Devouring consciousness.

385
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:14,200
Digesting power.

386
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:19,360
Monster of energy.

387
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:21,320
It's a monster.

388
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:27,160
I'm gonna kiss the snake on the tongue.

389
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:29,600
Kiss the serpent.

390
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:32,600
But if it senses fear...

391
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:35,440
it'll eat us instantly.

392
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:37,800
But if we kiss it without fear...

393
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:40,160
it'll take us through the garden.

394
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,920
Through the gate.

395
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,240
To the other side.

396
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:48,280
Ride the snake...

397
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:50,160
'til the end of time.

398
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:55,160
I think I'm fucked up, man.

399
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,680
I'm not thinking right.

400
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:59,520
Look at your eyes, man.
You're death.

401
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,640
I'm afraid of my father.

402
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:05,200
I can't be what they want me to be.

403
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:07,000
Maybe you should kill your father.

404
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,320
I'm in pain, man.

405
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,800
I feel the universe
functioning perfectly...

406
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:17,480
but I'm still perfectly locked
inside myself.

407
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:20,600
Instead of oneness, I feel isolation.

408
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,440
But you're alive.

409
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:26,080
- Feel it.
- I'm scared.

410
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,960
- It's beautiful.
- I'm still scared.

411
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Then use us.

412
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:33,160
Use our strength.
Come on in here.

413
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:35,000
That's right.

414
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:38,520
We're a tribe now.
A tribe of warriors.

415
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:43,480
I promise you, I'll be with you
to the end of time.

416
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:46,000
Nothing will destroy our circle.

417
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:47,920
Ride the snake.

418
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,840
Come on.

419
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:59,560
My wild love went riding

420
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:03,960
She rode all the day

421
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:08,760
She rode to the devil

422
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:12,440
Asked him to pay

423
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:17,760
My wild love went riding

424
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:21,040
She went to the sea

425
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:25,880
She went to the devil

426
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:31,000
All that's left was we

427
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:47,160
I'm lying.
I am afraid.

428
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,840
Don't go away!

429
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,200
Come dance with me!

430
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,840
Where you going, Jimmy?

431
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:26,640
This is the end

432
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:30,360
Beautiful friend

433
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,640
This is the end

434
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:40,120
My only friend, the end

435
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:43,840
Of our elaborate plans

436
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,840
The end

437
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:49,720
Of everything that stands

438
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,680
The end

439
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:55,320
No safety or surprise

440
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,280
The end

441
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:00,000
I'll never look

442
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:03,120
Into your eyes

443
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,320
Again

444
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:14,080
Can you picture what we'll be

445
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:18,160
So limitless and free

446
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:22,600
Desperately in need

447
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:26,160
Of some stranger's hand

448
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:31,600
In a desperate land

449
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:06,520
Lost in a Roman

450
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:10,960
Wilderness of pain

451
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:17,360
And all the children

452
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:20,360
Are insane

453
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:39,000
Waiting for the summer rain

454
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:59,520
There's danger on the edge of town

455
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:09,000
Ride the king's highway, baby

456
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:17,360
Weird scenes inside the gold mine

457
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:26,400
Ride the highway west, baby

458
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:33,680
Ride the snake

459
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,440
To the lake

460
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:47,520
The ancient lake, baby

461
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:52,560
The snake is long

462
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:55,640
Seven miles

463
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,320
Ride the snake

464
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:04,880
He's old

465
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:09,400
And his skin is cold

466
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:19,000
The west is the best

467
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:32,200
Get here and we'll do the rest

468
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:43,200
The blue bus

469
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:47,200
Is calling us

470
00:34:56,880 --> 00:35:01,360
Driver, where you taking us

471
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:19,520
The killer awoke before dawn.

472
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:21,840
He put his boots on.

473
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:25,960
He took a face...

474
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,800
from the ancient gallery...

475
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:31,200
and he walked on down the hall.

476
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:42,560
He went into the room
where his sister lived.

477
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:44,240
Then he...

478
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,480
paid a visit to his brother.

479
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:51,360
Then he...

480
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:55,320
He walked on down the hall.

481
00:35:57,560 --> 00:36:00,720
And he came to a door.

482
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:04,880
He looked inside.

483
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:12,120
"Father."
"Yes, son?"

484
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:14,320
"I want to kill you."

485
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,600
"Mother."

486
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:26,480
I want to

487
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:29,000
fuck you all night, baby

488
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,680
Come on, baby

489
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,520
"Mother, I want to fuck you"?

490
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,120
Come on

491
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,960
Fuck, fuck

492
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,560
Turn him off!
Turn his fucking amp off!

493
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,880
Fuck me, baby

494
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:11,400
Come on, baby

495
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,080
- He's insane!
- He's a great artist!

496
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:14,760
- We all love it!
- Come on

497
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:29,160
All right

498
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:37,880
Kill

499
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:50,840
Get him out of here!

500
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:50,920
- Get the fuck out of here!
- Kill the father.

501
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:53,680
- Get the fuck out of here!
- Kill the father.

502
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:57,760
Nobody's gonna fuck their mother
on my stage!

503
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:59,960
- That's what I mean!
- You're out of here!

504
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:02,240
Kill your father!
Fuck the mother!

505
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,960
All right!

506
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,840
Jerry, come on, man!

507
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:08,840
- Art, man! It's art!
- What do you know about art?

508
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:11,080
Take a look at the future, old man!

509
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:13,320
We're things to come!

510
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:15,480
Here's art.

511
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:18,840
- There's your art!
- This is fucking great!

512
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:22,560
- We'll never work in this town again.
- Quite a night.

513
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:24,600
I'm Jac Holzman.

514
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:27,200
- I own Elektra Records.
- Is that asshole gonna pay us?

515
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:32,160
I think if you can put
what you did in there on record...

516
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:34,800
we could really have something
and make a lot of money.

517
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,520
Rothchild here
was born to be your producer.

518
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:41,360
How you doing? Sorry about all this.
You guys are...

519
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:45,200
Bertolt Brecht. It's cabaret.
It's rock and roll.

520
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:47,160
I'm really blown away, guys.

521
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:51,360
I'd like to get you guys
into a studio immediately.

522
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:54,600
How would you like to come down
from there and make a record?

523
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:57,400
Sure.
Pretty good. Pretty neat.

524
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:02,360
Bruce, you feel it?

525
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,760
It's bitchin'.

526
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:09,160
An album of killer music in six days.
Six days, baby.

527
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,840
Unreal.

528
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:14,280
The time to hesitate is through

529
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:18,040
No time to wallow in the mire

530
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:21,200
Try now, we can only lose

531
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:25,120
And our love become a funeral pyre

532
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:27,760
Come on, baby, light my fire

533
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:35,320
Try to set the night on fire

534
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:09,920
L.B.J.! L.B.J.!

535
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:12,800
How many kids
have you killed today?

536
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:22,080
You know that it would be untrue

537
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:25,800
You know that I would be a liar

538
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:29,240
If I was to say to you

539
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:32,640
Girl, we couldn't get much higher

540
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:35,600
Come on, baby, light my fire

541
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:42,920
Try to set the night on fire

542
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,640
All right!

543
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:27,960
- Name? Occupation?
- Bill Siddons. I'm the manager.

544
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:29,360
I manage the Doors.

545
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:33,760
- Name? Occupation?
- Pamela Morrison. Ornament.

546
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:36,960
Robby Krieger.
Guitar player.

547
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:39,280
John Densmore.
Percussionist.

548
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:42,200
Twenty-two years old.
Far out, man.

549
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:45,640
- Name? Occupation?
- Raymond Daniel Manzarek.

550
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:49,840
Born 2-12-39.
Musician. Organist.

551
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:53,000
- Name? Occupation?
- Jim.

552
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:58,680
We're gonna be on TV.

553
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:00,280
Right this way, Mr. Sullivan.

554
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:00,440
They're called the Doors...

555
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:02,480
They're called the Doors...

556
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:05,280
and they've got the number one single
in the country right now.

557
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:07,200
"Light Your Fire."

558
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:10,440
Now, they're not your usual group...

559
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:12,880
but I think they're gonna fit in
just fine.

560
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:14,680
Everything's gonna be fine.

561
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:17,680
The riot continues in Detroit,
with 1,400 buildings burned.

562
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:19,320
No wonder "Light My Fire"
is number one.

563
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:23,200
So, what's your room number?

564
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:24,880
I'll talk to you later.

565
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:28,640
- You have got very serious hair.
- Were you pinching her butt?

566
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:32,440
- What about me?
- I won't open that kettle of worms.

567
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:34,360
What about you, handsome?
What can we do?

568
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:36,800
Some of the worst mistakes of my life
have been haircuts.

569
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:40,120
Don't wash it. Don't set it. Go away.
I like it just the way it is.

570
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:43,480
- Be mean.
- Boys. Boys.

571
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:45,400
Meet Mr. Sullivan.

572
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:47,600
Fellas, just great.

573
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:50,360
- I heard your record, "Light That Fire."
- "Light Your Fire."

574
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:51,960
- Just...
- "Light My Fire."

575
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:54,520
Fine.
Just really, really fine.

576
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:56,880
I have one small thing to bring up.

577
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:59,560
But it's important.
The guys at network told us...

578
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:01,480
they have a little problem...

579
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:04,840
with the lyric,
"Girl, we couldn't get much higher."

580
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:06,880
You can't say "higher"...

581
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:08,360
on network.

582
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:10,160
They asked if you could say, instead...

583
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:12,520
"Girl, we can't get much better."

584
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:14,520
- Can you dig that?
- How about...

585
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:18,080
"Girl, you couldn't bite my wire"?

586
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:21,680
I don't think
Standards and Practices would...

587
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:25,440
Why don't you have a nice, big smile
on your face when you get out there?

588
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:27,160
There's no point in being sullen.

589
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:29,880
- You know what I mean?
- We're a sullen group, Ed.

590
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:35,120
You boys should know, Mr. Sullivan
is considering you for four more shows.

591
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:36,440
- You dig?
- We dig.

592
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:39,720
I'll work it out.
Just give me five minutes.

593
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:41,640
- Groovy.
- Just give me five.

594
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:43,680
Have a great show.

595
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:49,400
Well?

596
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:53,800
- Come on.
- It's just a word.

597
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:56,280
The Stones changed
when they played here.

598
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:58,320
Why don't you change your name to...

599
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:00,720
Sidney or Irving Manzarek?

600
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:02,760
- It's just a word.
- Hey, man.

601
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:05,240
My words. I don't care.
Let's just jam.

602
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:06,520
And now...

603
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:09,000
direct from
Los Angeles, California...

604
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:12,440
ladies and gentlemen,
here now, the Doors!

605
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:17,520
You know that it would be untrue

606
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:19,480
We're okay sound wise?

607
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:25,880
If I was to say to you

608
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:29,240
Girl, we couldn't get much higher

609
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:30,920
He said it!

610
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,400
He said it on national TV.

611
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:35,960
- I can't believe that!
- Come on baby, light my fire

612
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:37,640
What's he doing? What's that?

613
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:40,400
Jesus! Get it off!
You can see his thing!

614
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:42,400
You blew it, you little shit!

615
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:44,320
You'll never play Sullivan again!

616
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:52,320
Can you just move a step forward?

617
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:54,800
Come on.
I know you love to look at yourself.

618
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:58,120
Great.

619
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:02,840
Let's try something different.
Take your shirt off.

620
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:06,400
- You take it off.
- Do you need help?

621
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:10,360
That's good.

622
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:15,600
The camera
is whatever you want it to be.

623
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:17,280
A woman you want to seduce.

624
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:21,000
A man you want to kill.

625
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:23,720
It can be anything you want.

626
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:25,400
That's nice.

627
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:28,280
That's great!

628
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:30,920
Do you have any idea
what these pictures can do?

629
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:34,560
One image controls millions of people.

630
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:37,120
- Where are the Doors?
- Right here.

631
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:38,480
Will you forget the Doors?

632
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:40,240
You're the one they want.

633
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:42,360
You are the Doors.
Come on.

634
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:45,520
That's it.
Be ugly.

635
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:49,400
I love that.

636
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:51,120
Anything you want.

637
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:53,200
There are no restrictions here.

638
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:57,880
Look at yourself.

639
00:46:57,920 --> 00:46:59,800
Fall in love with yourself.

640
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:04,760
You're your own audience now.

641
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:08,120
They want you.

642
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:12,600
Worship, love you.

643
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:14,160
Adore you.

644
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:17,040
Jim Morrison.

645
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:18,960
The god of rock...

646
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,880
and cock.

647
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:01,760
Not tonight, Edie.
Thank you, not tonight.

648
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:04,760
This is the fun part of my job.
This is history in the making.

649
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:09,200
Would you like to see my imitation
of a shrimp?

650
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:11,240
Let me put it this way.

651
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:14,560
Andy is more than an artist.
Andy Warhol is art.

652
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:17,720
Sometimes I think bright people
in America must ask themselves...

653
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:20,760
"Does Andy imitate life,
or does life imitate Andy?"

654
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:23,440
Jim, this is Tom Baker.

655
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:26,680
He's in one of Andy's movies,
"l, A Man."

656
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:29,240
- And this is Count "Ruspooli."
- Ruspoli.

657
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:31,080
He's Italian, but he lives in Paris.

658
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:34,520
He's from a very famous family,
700 years old.

659
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:37,280
Hi, Jim.
You are great.

660
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:40,200
I see you at Ondine's with Hendrix.

661
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:43,400
So cool.

662
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:45,320
- All right.
- Don't you like the way he talks?

663
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:47,760
- It's so cool.
- What's your trip?

664
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:50,200
My trip?
I thought it was yours.

665
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:53,160
I caught your gig at The Scene.
I thought it was pretty good.

666
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:54,880
I liked it a lot.
It was hot.

667
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:57,840
I like your movies, man.
You got a great penis.

668
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:03,040
We're gonna split.
Why don't you come with us?

669
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:06,520
- We're going to get a bite to eat.
- No, you can't leave.

670
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:08,040
Where's your will to be weird?

671
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:10,480
Look, that's Jim Morrison.

672
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:12,120
I like the Doors.

673
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:14,720
Let's get out of here.
These people are wacky.

674
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:19,000
Come with me.
Andy's waiting for you.

675
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:21,240
No, not now.
Let's do this later.

676
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:24,600
Do you remember San Francisco?

677
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:26,840
- No, not really.
- Have another joint.

678
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:28,520
Check it out.

679
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:32,640
This chick here sings with Andy's band,
The Velvet Underground.

680
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:36,000
She says she can
drink you under the table.

681
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:40,400
Hi, I'm Nico.

682
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:42,840
It's so boring tonight.

683
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:47,280
Some of us are going downtown
to a new club.

684
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:49,120
You want to come?

685
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:51,440
Elevate your taste in trolls, man.

686
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:56,120
Vodka?

687
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:58,040
I'll race you.

688
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:02,920
Your death.

689
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:09,200
Come on, man.
Let's go.

690
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:11,760
All right.
We're gonna go to a club.

691
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:14,760
I think this girl
wants to hang out with you.

692
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:18,520
Don't you want to meet Andy Warhol?

693
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:21,720
I could do without the guy.
He's a freak.

694
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:23,440
Come on.
We got a big gig tomorrow.

695
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:27,080
Wait. I thought we were going
to be a rock and roll band.

696
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:29,520
All right.
The four of us.

697
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:31,640
Come on.
This isn't our scene.

698
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:33,320
These people are vampires.

699
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:40,000
Come on, let's make the myths.
Remember?

700
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:41,400
Let's go.

701
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:43,120
Don't leave.

702
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:45,360
Come on, you guys.
Not tonight.

703
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:47,280
I don't know what'll happen.

704
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:50,000
It might be death.

705
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:53,560
It's not death, man.

706
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:55,240
I'll see you tomorrow.

707
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:26,680
Jimmy, this way.

708
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:29,520
Andy's waiting. This way.
I'll take you to him.

709
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:31,120
Hey, daddy.

710
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:33,920
Jimmy, please.
Come on.

711
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,840
Andy's waiting.
Come on.

712
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:40,080
Hey, man.
How you doin'?

713
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:42,120
All right.
How you doin', man?

714
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:43,560
Great.

715
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:46,720
Pretty good.
Pretty neat.

716
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:57,880
There was this big show
in Philadelphia.

717
00:51:57,960 --> 00:51:59,320
Andy.

718
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:01,400
There were so many
people there...

719
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:04,920
This is Jim Morrison of
the world-famous Doors musical group.

720
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,760
- Andy Warhol, of course.
- Hi. Wow.

721
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:10,440
We really like your music.

722
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:12,960
- How you doin', Andy?
- Oh, great.

723
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:17,040
And there were so many people
at the show...

724
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:21,160
the paintings
were getting crushed...

725
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:25,120
and they had to
take them all down.

726
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:29,240
Really, they were kind of...

727
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:31,800
great.

728
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:34,680
Just the walls.
You see, Andy was the art.

729
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:37,360
You should do a show
with just bare walls.

730
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:40,240
We'd really like to use you
in one of our movies, Jim.

731
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:42,160
You're really such a beauty.

732
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:46,160
Andy says someday everybody
will be famous for 15 days.

733
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:48,120
He'd really be great,
wouldn't he?

734
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:53,000
I mean...

735
00:52:56,280 --> 00:52:58,720
It's the singer,
not the song, right?

736
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:00,640
It's the astronaut,
not the voyage.

737
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:05,720
Somebody gave me this telephone.

738
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:09,240
- I think it was Edie, wasn't it?
- Yeah, it was Edie.

739
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:13,160
And she said that...

740
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:15,960
I could talk to God with it...

741
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,720
but I don't have anything to say.

742
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:21,400
Here. This is for you.

743
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:28,800
Now you can talk to God.

744
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:44,120
Morrison.

745
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:46,160
Come here.

746
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:07,120
Darling, listen,
I pay the bills...

747
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:09,680
so I can use any language
that I want.

748
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:12,120
The guy wants to talk
to the bum.

749
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:15,480
Check it out, brother.

750
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:46,960
What are your songs about,
Mr. Morrison?

751
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:51,000
Love, death, travel, revolt.

752
00:55:54,520 --> 00:55:56,720
We all write the songs.

753
00:55:56,760 --> 00:55:58,280
I'm interested in...

754
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:02,320
chaos, disorder...

755
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:05,320
especially activities which seem
to have no meaning, like this.

756
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:10,200
How do you feel about being called
"the ultimate Barbie doll"?

757
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:13,400
When you say something like that,
it's a shortcut to thinking.

758
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:17,520
And do you think about
the dreadful reviews...

759
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:19,440
your new poetry book has gotten?

760
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:21,880
I guess they didn't understand.

761
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:25,240
- Did you finance its publication?
- Have you bothered to read the poetry?

762
00:56:25,320 --> 00:56:29,080
You keep denying that nothing good
can come out of L.A.

763
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:31,000
That's a rather
provincial attitude.

764
00:56:31,080 --> 00:56:34,000
- Do you believe in drugs?
- I believe in excess.

765
00:56:34,040 --> 00:56:36,600
Is alcohol considered part
of the shaman's wisdom?

766
00:56:36,680 --> 00:56:38,160
It's the American way.

767
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:41,360
Every year we spend more money
on tobacco and alcohol...

768
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:43,000
than we do on education.

769
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:46,040
- On behalf of the British press...
- What about the future of the Doors?

770
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:48,880
- That's just an excuse for free sex.
- How do you spend your money?

771
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:56,640
I believe in a long, prolonged
derangement of the senses...

772
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:58,760
to attain the unknown.

773
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:02,160
Although I live
in the subconscious...

774
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:05,800
our pale reason
hides the infinite from us.

775
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:10,480
Are you, by any chance,
in a trance now?

776
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:14,920
Do you hurt?

777
00:57:16,320 --> 00:57:17,720
What?

778
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:20,840
What hurts you the most?

779
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:26,520
What do your parents think
about what you're doing?

780
00:57:26,560 --> 00:57:28,520
Actually,
I don't remember being born.

781
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:31,400
It must have happened
during one of my blackouts.

782
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:34,000
They must have expressed
some feeling.

783
00:57:34,040 --> 00:57:37,840
Well, to tell you the truth,
they're not living anymore...

784
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:40,880
so I really don't like
to talk about that.

785
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:43,920
Could you tell us how they died?

786
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:49,720
It was a...

787
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:52,280
horrible car crash...

788
00:57:52,360 --> 00:57:53,760
in New Mexico...

789
00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:55,840
in the '50s.

790
00:57:55,960 --> 00:57:59,120
My father ran right into
a truckload of Navahos.

791
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:00,240
They were...

792
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:04,440
all over the highway, bleeding.

793
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:08,920
Their souls, kind of
stirring in the breeze...

794
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:10,600
just leapt into mine.

795
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:15,680
I'm sorry.

796
00:58:17,120 --> 00:58:21,360
Mr. Krieger, do you really
consider Mr. Morrison a shaman?

797
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:52,680
Don't worry about it.
It happens to other guys too.

798
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:55,560
Wanna do some coke?

799
00:58:55,640 --> 00:58:57,480
It'll loosen you up.

800
00:58:57,560 --> 00:58:59,680
Sure. The new thing.

801
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:04,960
Wow.

802
00:59:07,320 --> 00:59:08,560
How old is this?

803
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:12,200
That's 14th century.

804
00:59:12,280 --> 00:59:15,000
- Witchcraft.
- It's a religion, you know.

805
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:16,840
Witchcraft.

806
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:19,000
Witches are
the protectors of the seasons...

807
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:22,200
the goddesses of the grain...

808
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:24,120
and when crossed...

809
00:59:25,560 --> 00:59:26,960
destroyers.

810
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:34,600
You ever try drinking blood?

811
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:37,520
What?

812
00:59:37,600 --> 00:59:39,840
It works, you know.

813
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:42,720
Drink it at the right time
of the moon.

814
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:48,200
They used to dance
in the forests naked.

815
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:51,080
I think that's what
offended the Puritans...

816
00:59:51,160 --> 00:59:52,720
and led to the burnings.

817
00:59:54,080 --> 00:59:57,240
They were a sexual threat
to their male order...

818
00:59:57,320 --> 00:59:59,480
like the Bacchae.

819
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:01,360
Five days a year,
for Dionysus...

820
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:04,280
they used to wander the hills
of ancient Greece.

821
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:07,560
The first witches.

822
01:00:07,640 --> 01:00:10,800
Clans of wild women...

823
01:00:11,840 --> 01:00:13,880
Iooting...

824
01:00:13,960 --> 01:00:15,120
fucking...

825
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:18,200
eating animals raw...

826
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:22,200
Iooking for Dionysus...

827
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:24,080
to tear him...

828
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:25,520
to pieces!

829
01:00:29,560 --> 01:00:31,440
Where do you get the blood?

830
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:37,680
Blood is the rose
of mysterious union.

831
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:40,600
Symbol of potency.

832
01:00:41,640 --> 01:00:44,440
- Now you.
- I can't cut myself.

833
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:47,760
Don't be such a child.
If I do it, you have to do it.

834
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:53,840
You do it.

835
01:02:00,080 --> 01:02:02,040
Come on, rock god.

836
01:02:02,120 --> 01:02:04,320
Fuck me.
Fuck me good.

837
01:02:24,080 --> 01:02:27,640
What do you want me to do?
What can I do, baby?

838
01:02:33,720 --> 01:02:36,040
- What's the matter?
- Will you die for me?

839
01:02:36,120 --> 01:02:39,240
What do you want me to do?

840
01:02:39,320 --> 01:02:42,000
Maybe I should see
a doctor or something.

841
01:02:43,320 --> 01:02:47,280
What do you think?
Someone from the Freudian philosophy?

842
01:02:49,880 --> 01:02:51,880
It happens to other guys too.

843
01:02:57,200 --> 01:02:59,040
You know, that's the irony.

844
01:03:01,880 --> 01:03:05,320
Teenage death girls
want my dick, not my words.

845
01:03:13,560 --> 01:03:15,880
It's not so complicated.

846
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:17,760
It's just sex, you know.

847
01:03:17,840 --> 01:03:21,080
Never wake up
in a good mood again.

848
01:03:21,160 --> 01:03:24,280
It's the hours and the pressure.

849
01:03:24,360 --> 01:03:27,640
You do everything
like it's your last performance.

850
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:30,640
We weren't built to last.
You never know.

851
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:34,480
You're setting yourself up, you know.
You're setting yourself up.

852
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,280
You're a poet, not a rock star.

853
01:03:39,320 --> 01:03:41,160
You really know what I am?

854
01:03:42,760 --> 01:03:46,640
- You know what poetry is?
- You don't belong on Ed Sullivan.

855
01:03:46,720 --> 01:03:48,600
Who am I?

856
01:03:50,040 --> 01:03:53,000
Where's the feast
they promised us?

857
01:03:53,080 --> 01:03:54,920
Where's the new wine?

858
01:03:56,640 --> 01:03:58,520
Dying on the vine.

859
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:05,440
See, I lied to you.

860
01:04:10,360 --> 01:04:12,240
I loved fame.

861
01:04:12,280 --> 01:04:14,840
I do love fame.

862
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:23,440
- Why are you doing this to me?
- 'Cause you're here.

863
01:04:23,480 --> 01:04:25,240
And that's gonna help?

864
01:04:26,360 --> 01:04:29,400
I don't have this problem
with anybody else.

865
01:04:29,480 --> 01:04:31,320
Suck it, honey.
Come on.

866
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:33,360
- Fuck you.
- Where you goin'? Huh?

867
01:04:33,400 --> 01:04:35,280
Where do you think you're going?

868
01:04:36,440 --> 01:04:37,720
Love my girl!

869
01:04:37,800 --> 01:04:39,720
How many guys have you fucked?

870
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:42,240
And how many dogs
have you fucked?

871
01:04:42,320 --> 01:04:45,000
You're the only one
who couldn't make it, you asshole!

872
01:04:45,080 --> 01:04:48,360
You are the only limp dick
in the lot!

873
01:04:51,080 --> 01:04:52,920
Will you die for me?

874
01:04:54,080 --> 01:04:56,440
- Answer me!
- Will you die for me?

875
01:04:56,520 --> 01:04:58,000
Sure.

876
01:04:58,040 --> 01:04:59,480
I'd die for anybody.

877
01:04:59,560 --> 01:05:02,960
Shut up in there!
I'm trying to sleep in here!

878
01:05:07,080 --> 01:05:08,640
- Will you die for me?
- Yes!

879
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:10,000
I don't believe you!

880
01:05:10,040 --> 01:05:11,960
- Say it!
- Yes. Yes.

881
01:05:19,960 --> 01:05:21,840
I'm just a clown.

882
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:24,640
Am I a clown?

883
01:05:31,120 --> 01:05:32,560
I need a home...

884
01:05:33,720 --> 01:05:35,280
a place to hide.

885
01:05:37,160 --> 01:05:38,360
I'm sorry.

886
01:05:38,440 --> 01:05:41,600
We're gonna fuck death away.
Come on.

887
01:05:43,800 --> 01:05:46,440
Let's fuck death away.
Come on, baby. All right.

888
01:05:50,960 --> 01:05:54,760
An ancient lunatic reigns
in the trees of the night.

889
01:06:10,280 --> 01:06:12,600
We've got
a serious problem here.

890
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:15,480
The fire marshal
won't let this concert go on...

891
01:06:15,520 --> 01:06:18,360
unless you clear the aisles
and go back to your seats.

892
01:06:18,440 --> 01:06:21,640
Unless you clear these aisles,
there is no show.

893
01:06:21,720 --> 01:06:23,800
The sound of the crowd.

894
01:06:23,880 --> 01:06:26,880
I don't even like rock groups.
They're sleazy.

895
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:31,280
- You like that, huh?
- Like Nuremberg.

896
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:33,200
- Like that?
- We're Germans.

897
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:36,360
- Beg.
- I'm begging.

898
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:39,400
You wanna fuck me?

899
01:06:41,040 --> 01:06:43,360
Don't ever fuckin' lie
to me again.

900
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:47,960
- About what?
- Why did you say your father was dead?

901
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,320
He is dead.
Both of them. Totally.

902
01:06:50,360 --> 01:06:53,480
If he's so dead,
who answered the phone when I called?

903
01:06:53,560 --> 01:06:54,920
What?

904
01:06:56,560 --> 01:06:59,840
You didn't really think you were
getting away with that, did you?

905
01:06:59,960 --> 01:07:02,400
Your father's an admiral
in the Navy...

906
01:07:02,520 --> 01:07:06,280
who was at the Gulf of Tonkin
when the Vietnam War broke out.

907
01:07:11,720 --> 01:07:12,760
Wow.

908
01:07:12,840 --> 01:07:15,720
Your dad's deputy chief
of operations.

909
01:07:15,800 --> 01:07:18,200
Just don't ever lie
to me again.

910
01:07:25,720 --> 01:07:27,120
What?

911
01:07:30,560 --> 01:07:32,040
You shouldn't have done that.

912
01:07:32,120 --> 01:07:35,440
Like it's so hard
to trace your school records?

913
01:07:35,480 --> 01:07:39,800
You went to University of Florida,
Albuquerque, New Mexico...

914
01:07:39,880 --> 01:07:42,280
Arlington, Virginia...

915
01:07:42,360 --> 01:07:44,360
Washington, D.C.

916
01:07:45,400 --> 01:07:48,200
You have a brother
and a sister.

917
01:07:48,280 --> 01:07:51,560
"Seven Miles Long," baby.
It's all in "The End."

918
01:08:06,200 --> 01:08:07,480
I'm sorry.

919
01:08:08,520 --> 01:08:10,360
What did he do?

920
01:08:11,840 --> 01:08:13,720
Did he love you?

921
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:18,360
How much?

922
01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:25,000
Your mama?

923
01:08:31,240 --> 01:08:34,040
Hatred's
a very underestimated emotion.

924
01:08:36,160 --> 01:08:38,360
Doesn't matter anymore,
does it?

925
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:43,280
Do you hear them out there?
Are you listening to them?

926
01:08:45,360 --> 01:08:47,200
It's you they want now.

927
01:08:48,840 --> 01:08:50,680
It's not the Doors.

928
01:08:51,800 --> 01:08:54,640
It's not your mother
or your father's child.

929
01:08:55,920 --> 01:08:57,280
It's you.

930
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:03,800
They don't want me.
They want my death.

931
01:09:03,880 --> 01:09:05,720
Ripped to pieces.

932
01:09:07,400 --> 01:09:09,480
Patricia, just hold me.

933
01:09:12,360 --> 01:09:13,520
What you doin' there?

934
01:09:15,440 --> 01:09:16,960
- Nothin'.
- Okay, out.

935
01:09:17,040 --> 01:09:18,480
No one's allowed backstage.

936
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:22,000
- Don't you know who this is?
- It's cool. I'm with the band.

937
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:23,920
Let's go. Come on.

938
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,040
- Cool it, pig.
- Fuckin' hippie!

939
01:09:26,960 --> 01:09:28,240
Motherfucker!

940
01:09:32,520 --> 01:09:33,880
They got Jim!

941
01:09:34,920 --> 01:09:36,520
What's happening?

942
01:09:36,560 --> 01:09:39,280
What the fuck is going on here?

943
01:09:40,320 --> 01:09:42,520
I'm blind!

944
01:09:42,600 --> 01:09:45,520
- He's under arrest.
- Don't shut your eyes, Jim!

945
01:09:47,040 --> 01:09:48,880
We gotta get you out.

946
01:09:49,960 --> 01:09:51,440
Leave him alone.

947
01:09:51,480 --> 01:09:54,800
- He doesn't need more shit in his life.
- What do you know what he needs?

948
01:10:02,360 --> 01:10:03,680
Fuck!

949
01:10:04,680 --> 01:10:06,080
All right

950
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:08,600
Okay

951
01:10:09,760 --> 01:10:11,120
All right

952
01:10:18,120 --> 01:10:19,480
I am

953
01:10:21,560 --> 01:10:24,400
Your back door man

954
01:10:25,440 --> 01:10:27,080
"Light My Fire!"

955
01:10:29,080 --> 01:10:31,160
Men don't know

956
01:10:31,240 --> 01:10:34,480
Little girls understand

957
01:10:34,520 --> 01:10:36,600
Fire! "Light My Fire!"

958
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:41,240
Well, all your people

959
01:10:42,320 --> 01:10:43,920
Tryin' to sleep

960
01:10:44,920 --> 01:10:46,800
I'm out there makin'

961
01:10:46,840 --> 01:10:49,400
Midnight creep

962
01:10:54,920 --> 01:10:56,760
Back door man

963
01:11:00,200 --> 01:11:02,320
Men don't know

964
01:11:02,400 --> 01:11:03,440
Little girls

965
01:11:04,120 --> 01:11:05,440
Understand

966
01:11:08,360 --> 01:11:10,320
All right, yeah

967
01:11:12,080 --> 01:11:13,440
Come on

968
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:34,880
Persian night, babe

969
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,440
See that light, babe

970
01:11:41,320 --> 01:11:43,400
Save us

971
01:11:45,560 --> 01:11:47,880
Jesus

972
01:11:50,120 --> 01:11:52,560
Save us

973
01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:15,160
I want to tell you about something
that happened a few minutes ago...

974
01:12:15,280 --> 01:12:17,560
right here in New Haven.

975
01:12:17,640 --> 01:12:20,520
This is New Haven, isn't it?
New Haven, Connecticut?

976
01:12:21,720 --> 01:12:24,040
United States of America?

977
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:27,720
Is the West really the best...

978
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:30,480
or are you just stoned on weed?

979
01:12:30,560 --> 01:12:32,720
Come on!
Sing "Light My Fire."

980
01:12:47,080 --> 01:12:49,480
I was with this girl backstage.

981
01:12:50,480 --> 01:12:53,040
We wanted some privacy...

982
01:12:53,120 --> 01:12:55,600
so we went into
this shower stall.

983
01:12:58,200 --> 01:13:01,040
We weren't doing anything.
We were just talking.

984
01:13:02,360 --> 01:13:04,800
All of the sudden this...

985
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:07,000
this little man came in...

986
01:13:07,080 --> 01:13:10,480
with a little blue hat
and a little blue suit.

987
01:13:14,040 --> 01:13:16,600
He said,
"What you doin' in there?"

988
01:13:16,680 --> 01:13:18,480
I said, "Nothing."

989
01:13:19,240 --> 01:13:20,600
And he said...

990
01:13:20,680 --> 01:13:23,600
"Well, you'd better
get out of there or..."

991
01:13:23,680 --> 01:13:25,920
"Or what?" I said.

992
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:27,840
And he started pushin' me.

993
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:31,360
So I started pushin' back!

994
01:13:32,600 --> 01:13:34,040
He didn't like that.

995
01:13:40,200 --> 01:13:43,960
Then he reached behind
and pulled out a can of Mace...

996
01:13:46,200 --> 01:13:49,040
and sprayed it right in my eyes.

997
01:13:50,320 --> 01:13:51,920
Fuckin' blinded me!

998
01:13:53,560 --> 01:13:55,120
Why?

999
01:13:55,200 --> 01:13:58,720
All because I was alone
in a room with a girl...

1000
01:13:58,760 --> 01:14:03,120
doing what he'd like to be doing if
he could only get it up without a gun.

1001
01:14:03,200 --> 01:14:04,880
All right!

1002
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,720
In the United States
of America, man!

1003
01:14:09,720 --> 01:14:12,280
Land of the free,
home of the brave!

1004
01:14:12,360 --> 01:14:14,280
In God we trust!

1005
01:14:20,400 --> 01:14:22,160
Say your thing, man.

1006
01:14:22,240 --> 01:14:24,880
Mr. Morrison,
you've gone too far.

1007
01:14:24,920 --> 01:14:27,000
The show's over.

1008
01:14:28,040 --> 01:14:30,600
You've violated
state obscenity laws.

1009
01:14:30,640 --> 01:14:33,080
- You're under arrest!
- There you go!

1010
01:14:42,200 --> 01:14:44,080
Out of the way!

1011
01:14:44,160 --> 01:14:46,640
Get out of the way!

1012
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:53,480
Back! Keep 'em back!

1013
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,320
Get your hands off me,
you slaves.

1014
01:15:00,320 --> 01:15:03,160
This isn't happening to me, man.
It's happening to you.

1015
01:15:10,200 --> 01:15:13,680
Let's just say I was testing
the bounds of reality.

1016
01:15:13,720 --> 01:15:15,560
That's all.
I was curious.

1017
01:15:17,120 --> 01:15:19,920
I always preferred
to be hated...

1018
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:23,000
like Erich von Stroheim
in the movies.

1019
01:15:23,080 --> 01:15:25,040
The man you love to hate.

1020
01:15:26,040 --> 01:15:28,720
It's meant to be ironic...

1021
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:31,600
like courage wants to laugh.

1022
01:15:32,320 --> 01:15:35,120
Essentially, a stupid situation.

1023
01:15:35,200 --> 01:15:38,160
I go out on the stage
and howl for people.

1024
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:43,360
In me they see exactly
what they wanna see.

1025
01:15:44,560 --> 01:15:47,360
Some say "lizard king,"
whatever that means.

1026
01:15:48,680 --> 01:15:50,520
Or some black-clad leather demon...

1027
01:15:50,600 --> 01:15:52,440
whatever that means.

1028
01:15:54,040 --> 01:15:56,400
But really,
I think of myself...

1029
01:15:57,520 --> 01:16:00,360
as a sensitive,
intelligent human being...

1030
01:16:02,160 --> 01:16:05,520
but with the soul of a clown
that always forces me to blow it...

1031
01:16:05,640 --> 01:16:07,960
at the most crucial moments.

1032
01:16:15,480 --> 01:16:17,360
I'm a fake hero.

1033
01:16:19,240 --> 01:16:21,960
A joke that God's played on me.

1034
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:22,040
Good morning.

1035
01:16:22,040 --> 01:16:23,720
Good morning.

1036
01:16:23,800 --> 01:16:25,680
Pour me my breakfast,
Dolores.

1037
01:16:27,720 --> 01:16:30,720
What's the matter with Jimbo?
Can't handle it, eh?

1038
01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:32,040
He's pussy-whipped.

1039
01:16:32,120 --> 01:16:35,560
Hey, Jim, eat this, man.
We got one last place to go.

1040
01:16:35,640 --> 01:16:37,520
Ray's getting married this morning.
Remember?

1041
01:16:37,560 --> 01:16:39,120
"Alive, she cried."

1042
01:16:39,200 --> 01:16:41,440
Can't eat that.
It'll make me sick.

1043
01:16:41,520 --> 01:16:44,160
Give me a Dos Equis,
will you, Dolores.

1044
01:16:44,240 --> 01:16:47,760
- And a Ramos fizz.
- What happened to you last night?

1045
01:16:47,880 --> 01:16:51,920
You bet me $1,000 you were gonna
walk on the ledge of the 9000 building.

1046
01:16:52,040 --> 01:16:53,160
Let's go right now.

1047
01:16:53,200 --> 01:16:56,720
Complaining about going home
to your sanctuary.

1048
01:16:56,760 --> 01:16:58,600
We were gonna make a movie.

1049
01:16:59,920 --> 01:17:02,000
You bet me 1,000 bucks, man.

1050
01:17:02,080 --> 01:17:04,520
- Give him a double.
- A triple.

1051
01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:06,960
Imagine me and Morrison
in a movie together.

1052
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,200
Two powerful, two Irish...

1053
01:17:09,280 --> 01:17:13,320
two-fisted fuckin' drinkin' guys
in the same movie together.

1054
01:17:13,360 --> 01:17:14,760
I'll direct it.

1055
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:17,160
If Dennis Hopper can do it,
I can.

1056
01:17:17,200 --> 01:17:21,000
We'll all three direct it.
A real road movie in black and white.

1057
01:17:21,040 --> 01:17:22,920
We'll call it Zero.

1058
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:26,760
- What the fuck?
- Fuck you, Morrison!

1059
01:17:26,800 --> 01:17:28,400
Get outta here!

1060
01:17:28,480 --> 01:17:29,680
Fuckin' jack-off!

1061
01:17:36,520 --> 01:17:38,400
Keep the drink.

1062
01:17:39,920 --> 01:17:39,920
It's only another 95,000...

1063
01:17:39,920 --> 01:17:43,400
It's only another 95,000...

1064
01:17:43,440 --> 01:17:47,400
but I could get the best clothes
from India, from Morocco, Jim.

1065
01:17:47,440 --> 01:17:49,320
Clothes you couldn't get
anywhere else.

1066
01:17:49,360 --> 01:17:52,960
Then we could get the richest
people to come... Miles Davis...

1067
01:17:53,040 --> 01:17:56,000
Sonny and Cher, the Stones.

1068
01:17:56,080 --> 01:17:59,320
It could be the best boutique
on La Cienega, Jim.

1069
01:17:59,400 --> 01:18:01,920
Why don't we have a car?

1070
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,560
- We lost it.
- Yeah, but...

1071
01:18:04,600 --> 01:18:06,480
where's the gravy train?

1072
01:18:11,120 --> 01:18:14,000
What's the matter with you?
What are you on?

1073
01:18:14,040 --> 01:18:16,200
You said you wouldn't
drink today.

1074
01:18:16,240 --> 01:18:18,880
No, Ma, I ain't drinkin'.

1075
01:18:18,920 --> 01:18:22,560
You promised you wouldn't drink anymore.
You're not gonna drink, are you?

1076
01:18:22,640 --> 01:18:24,240
No, Ma, I ain't.

1077
01:18:24,280 --> 01:18:27,880
And you're gonna change those stinky
leathers you've worn for three weeks.

1078
01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:30,200
I don't know about that.

1079
01:18:30,280 --> 01:18:32,120
What are you on?

1080
01:18:33,840 --> 01:18:36,720
It's just some low-grade acid.
It's not heavy.

1081
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:38,600
Oh, Jim!

1082
01:18:38,640 --> 01:18:41,000
Oh, God! I cooked!

1083
01:18:41,040 --> 01:18:43,040
- I cooked the duck!
- It's okay.

1084
01:18:43,120 --> 01:18:45,320
People are coming, you know.

1085
01:18:45,360 --> 01:18:48,400
Ray and Dorothy think
that we're flaky enough.

1086
01:18:48,440 --> 01:18:52,120
You said we'd wait until after,
and now you're gonna peak before me.

1087
01:18:52,200 --> 01:18:55,320
No, it's cool. We'll trip,
and then we'll eat our feast.

1088
01:18:55,400 --> 01:18:57,080
Yeah, sure. No!

1089
01:18:57,160 --> 01:19:00,680
You know, I think it's a good thing
about Ray and Dorothy.

1090
01:19:00,720 --> 01:19:02,600
I do.

1091
01:19:02,640 --> 01:19:04,560
Women are such noble creatures.

1092
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:07,760
They carry on your name
with dignity after you die.

1093
01:19:10,320 --> 01:19:13,120
Are you saying you want to
marry me, Jim Morrison?

1094
01:19:14,560 --> 01:19:19,960
I think women have a comic
approach to life. How can they not?

1095
01:19:20,040 --> 01:19:23,440
They spend their lives
with that big dick seeking entry.

1096
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:25,120
Come on, Mom.

1097
01:19:25,160 --> 01:19:29,120
I want to look inside,
like a spy.

1098
01:19:30,480 --> 01:19:33,160
I'm a spy

1099
01:19:33,200 --> 01:19:37,000
In the house of love

1100
01:19:38,280 --> 01:19:41,600
I know the dream

1101
01:19:42,760 --> 01:19:46,520
That you're dreamin' of

1102
01:19:46,600 --> 01:19:49,880
I know the word

1103
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:55,120
That you long to hear

1104
01:19:55,200 --> 01:19:59,600
I know your deepest

1105
01:19:59,640 --> 01:20:02,320
Secret fear

1106
01:20:03,840 --> 01:20:06,520
I know

1107
01:20:06,600 --> 01:20:08,600
Everything

1108
01:20:10,720 --> 01:20:13,040
I love it
when you sing to me.

1109
01:20:13,120 --> 01:20:14,120
That's 'cause...

1110
01:20:14,920 --> 01:20:17,720
I'm the poet
and you're my muse.

1111
01:20:21,280 --> 01:20:21,320
"Lions in the street, roaming.

1112
01:20:21,320 --> 01:20:24,040
"Lions in the street, roaming.

1113
01:20:24,080 --> 01:20:27,120
Dogs in heat, rabid, foaming.

1114
01:20:27,200 --> 01:20:30,800
A beast, caged in the heart
of the city, rotting...

1115
01:20:30,880 --> 01:20:32,440
in the summer ground.

1116
01:20:32,560 --> 01:20:33,800
He fled the town...

1117
01:20:33,840 --> 01:20:36,240
left the chaos and disorder
back there... u

1118
01:20:36,320 --> 01:20:38,600
Hey, everybody.
Here's the nuptial couple.

1119
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:42,480
What am I gonna do
about all these papers?

1120
01:20:42,560 --> 01:20:44,080
- Get a drink.
- Jim.

1121
01:20:45,360 --> 01:20:48,840
You really need somebody
to organize all this stuff.

1122
01:20:48,920 --> 01:20:51,960
Your handwriting
is just like a little kid.

1123
01:20:52,040 --> 01:20:56,040
Look at this. I wonder if William Blake
was ever this disorganized.

1124
01:20:59,760 --> 01:21:02,760
- You're trying too hard.
- I'm gonna be your editor now.

1125
01:21:02,840 --> 01:21:07,720
I'm gonna organize all this stuff
and take out all the "fuck" words.

1126
01:21:07,800 --> 01:21:11,600
- Honey, you're trying too hard.
- No, I'm not.

1127
01:21:11,720 --> 01:21:15,240
There's some great poetry here,
some wonderful ideas.

1128
01:21:15,320 --> 01:21:16,760
Come on in!

1129
01:21:18,360 --> 01:21:19,760
- Hey, Jimbo!
- Hey, man.

1130
01:21:19,880 --> 01:21:22,560
Hi, baby.
How's it goin'?

1131
01:21:23,600 --> 01:21:26,000
- Yo, Ray.
- Hey, Dog, how you doin'?

1132
01:21:26,040 --> 01:21:29,600
- Get some drinks over there.
- What am I supposed to do?

1133
01:21:32,080 --> 01:21:35,040
Who am I supposed to be
around all these people?

1134
01:21:35,120 --> 01:21:36,400
Darling Pamela.

1135
01:21:37,200 --> 01:21:39,080
I brought you something.

1136
01:21:40,720 --> 01:21:42,640
You're my girl, that's who.

1137
01:21:43,920 --> 01:21:45,760
I'm not your girl.

1138
01:21:46,920 --> 01:21:50,840
I know you fuck everything
that touches you.

1139
01:21:50,920 --> 01:21:53,320
- Don't give me that shit.
- Come on.

1140
01:21:54,320 --> 01:21:56,760
I love my girl!
Listen, everybody!

1141
01:21:56,840 --> 01:21:58,400
Pam and l...

1142
01:21:59,440 --> 01:22:00,920
She's lookin' good.

1143
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:02,360
And to celebrate...

1144
01:22:03,440 --> 01:22:05,280
- Hey, Patricia.
- Hi, Jim.

1145
01:22:08,240 --> 01:22:10,080
Pam, have you met...

1146
01:22:10,160 --> 01:22:11,320
Do you know...

1147
01:22:11,400 --> 01:22:15,600
She wrote this great review
of my poetry book.

1148
01:22:15,640 --> 01:22:19,200
- Let's go eat that turkey.
- Pam, let's set those plates.

1149
01:22:19,280 --> 01:22:21,480
Are you Patricia Kennealy?

1150
01:22:21,560 --> 01:22:23,040
You must be Pamela.

1151
01:22:27,320 --> 01:22:29,640
You actually put your dick
in this woman?

1152
01:22:31,120 --> 01:22:32,720
Well...

1153
01:22:32,760 --> 01:22:34,200
sometimes, yeah.

1154
01:22:37,800 --> 01:22:39,640
Well, I understand.
I really do.

1155
01:22:39,720 --> 01:22:43,400
But don't ever expect that Jim's
gonna love you or take care of you...

1156
01:22:43,440 --> 01:22:45,320
because you're one
of a hundred.

1157
01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:49,080
- You don't know when to stop.
- Look who's talking.

1158
01:22:49,160 --> 01:22:53,200
Jim can make up his own mind
about who he loves and who he doesn't.

1159
01:22:53,240 --> 01:22:54,640
Don't kid yourself, sweetheart.

1160
01:22:54,680 --> 01:22:58,200
He's crazy, but not that crazy.
He loves me.

1161
01:22:58,280 --> 01:23:00,120
Let's go check
those sweet potatoes.

1162
01:23:00,200 --> 01:23:02,760
- There they go again.
- Chuck!

1163
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:05,960
Gonna be another one of those dinners?
You're gonna have to stop this.

1164
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:10,280
I'm glad you made it.
Jim, Robbie, meet Chuck Vincent.

1165
01:23:12,880 --> 01:23:15,920
I just have one more thing
to say to you, Jim Morrison.

1166
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,800
You have ruined
another Thanksgiving.

1167
01:23:18,840 --> 01:23:21,200
Bastard!
You killed my duck!

1168
01:23:25,320 --> 01:23:27,560
You ruined my duck!

1169
01:23:30,760 --> 01:23:32,680
What did you do to her?

1170
01:23:32,760 --> 01:23:35,240
It's all right.
We're working it out.

1171
01:23:35,280 --> 01:23:36,680
We'll work it out.

1172
01:23:36,720 --> 01:23:38,600
It's okay.

1173
01:23:44,840 --> 01:23:46,200
Fuck you!

1174
01:23:56,880 --> 01:23:59,680
You want to know
what murder is?

1175
01:23:59,760 --> 01:24:01,600
You want a little death?

1176
01:24:02,640 --> 01:24:03,840
Well, come on.

1177
01:24:03,920 --> 01:24:06,040
You want a little death?

1178
01:24:06,120 --> 01:24:09,520
Then kill me.
Go on, kill me. Come on.

1179
01:24:10,600 --> 01:24:12,680
Kill me. Go on!

1180
01:24:12,760 --> 01:24:14,960
Come on, give me some death!

1181
01:24:17,400 --> 01:24:19,240
You killed my duck.

1182
01:24:24,080 --> 01:24:26,920
And I'm still killing
your fucking duck.

1183
01:24:26,960 --> 01:24:29,480
There! Murder! Death!

1184
01:24:29,520 --> 01:24:30,960
Duck! Dead!

1185
01:24:31,040 --> 01:24:32,600
Dead! Fucking dead!

1186
01:24:32,680 --> 01:24:36,040
There! The duck is dead!

1187
01:24:36,120 --> 01:24:38,920
- That's the incredible truth!
- Stop this shit! Get sane!

1188
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:41,320
Don't ever tell me what to do!

1189
01:24:41,360 --> 01:24:43,360
- Yeah, fuck off, Ray.
- Fuck off, Ray.

1190
01:24:45,680 --> 01:24:47,520
This party's gettin' low-rent.

1191
01:24:47,600 --> 01:24:49,040
Let's split.

1192
01:24:49,160 --> 01:24:51,040
Looks like
we're not gonna eat.

1193
01:24:51,120 --> 01:24:52,520
Shit.

1194
01:24:54,280 --> 01:24:56,760
Fuck it.
Let's eat this thing.

1195
01:24:56,880 --> 01:25:00,320
What happened to us,
Daddy, huh?

1196
01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:05,880
There was some
beautiful poetry, you know.

1197
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:07,360
Hold on, honey.

1198
01:25:07,440 --> 01:25:09,560
There was some
beautiful poetry, Daddy.

1199
01:25:20,760 --> 01:25:20,800
Action!

1200
01:25:20,800 --> 01:25:22,280
Action!

1201
01:25:39,640 --> 01:25:41,520
Your mother's here
with your brother.

1202
01:25:41,640 --> 01:25:45,160
I don't want to see 'em, okay?

1203
01:25:45,240 --> 01:25:47,920
- What do you want me to do with 'em?
- You hear me?

1204
01:25:47,960 --> 01:25:49,160
They're waiting!

1205
01:25:50,160 --> 01:25:51,920
Ladies and gentlemen...

1206
01:25:51,960 --> 01:25:54,120
from Los Angeles, California...

1207
01:25:54,160 --> 01:25:56,320
the Doors!

1208
01:25:56,400 --> 01:25:58,400
Pretty good.
Pretty neat.

1209
01:26:22,160 --> 01:26:24,000
Not to touch the earth

1210
01:26:24,040 --> 01:26:26,280
Not to see the sun

1211
01:26:26,320 --> 01:26:29,680
Nothing left to do
but run, run, run

1212
01:26:29,760 --> 01:26:30,640
Let's run

1213
01:26:33,960 --> 01:26:35,640
Let's run

1214
01:26:38,720 --> 01:26:40,680
House upon the hill

1215
01:26:40,720 --> 01:26:42,680
Moon is lying still

1216
01:26:42,760 --> 01:26:44,720
Shadows of the trees

1217
01:26:44,800 --> 01:26:46,760
Witnessing the wild breeze

1218
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:49,440
Come on, baby, run with me

1219
01:26:49,520 --> 01:26:51,160
Come on, honey.

1220
01:26:51,240 --> 01:26:54,040
I been so lonely.
I miss my girl.

1221
01:26:58,160 --> 01:27:00,640
I didn't realize
you were entertaining.

1222
01:27:01,760 --> 01:27:04,080
I hope you are cool about this.

1223
01:27:05,640 --> 01:27:07,960
Don't forget your smack
on the way out.

1224
01:27:08,880 --> 01:27:10,480
The mansion is warm

1225
01:27:10,560 --> 01:27:12,560
At the top of the hill

1226
01:27:12,640 --> 01:27:15,440
Rich are the rooms
and the comforts there

1227
01:27:16,240 --> 01:27:17,560
Red are the arms

1228
01:27:17,640 --> 01:27:19,400
Of luxuriant chairs

1229
01:27:19,440 --> 01:27:23,480
And you won't know a thing
'til you get inside here

1230
01:27:29,520 --> 01:27:32,080
Yeah? Looking for a place
to hide, or to die?

1231
01:27:32,160 --> 01:27:35,240
Just doing my thing,
like you said.

1232
01:27:36,080 --> 01:27:38,400
- What?
- You're hurting me.

1233
01:27:38,480 --> 01:27:39,680
Are you in pain?

1234
01:27:39,720 --> 01:27:42,560
Let me introduce you
to my friend pain.

1235
01:27:45,040 --> 01:27:46,720
Fuck you.

1236
01:27:46,800 --> 01:27:49,760
Oh, sanctuary.
Looking for a place to hide?

1237
01:27:49,840 --> 01:27:52,640
- I'll give you a place to hide.
- From you, you pig.

1238
01:27:52,720 --> 01:27:54,560
Forever.

1239
01:27:57,480 --> 01:28:00,320
Hey, honey, this is
the best part of the trip.

1240
01:28:01,520 --> 01:28:03,200
Sanctuary.

1241
01:28:03,280 --> 01:28:05,840
Come on, baby.
Come on, honey.

1242
01:28:06,840 --> 01:28:08,040
Almost home.

1243
01:28:11,080 --> 01:28:13,040
We're almost home, baby.

1244
01:28:27,400 --> 01:28:28,440
Help!

1245
01:28:28,520 --> 01:28:31,000
- It's blinding me.
- Help! I'm blind!

1246
01:28:33,040 --> 01:28:34,120
That's better.

1247
01:28:35,400 --> 01:28:36,920
Ride 'em, cowboy!

1248
01:28:37,680 --> 01:28:39,520
- Look out.
- What?

1249
01:28:39,600 --> 01:28:41,440
- There's a cop. Slow down.
- Where?

1250
01:28:41,480 --> 01:28:43,560
Right there in front!
Look!

1251
01:28:45,840 --> 01:28:49,200
Dead president's corpse
in the driver's car

1252
01:28:49,280 --> 01:28:53,360
The engine
runs on glue and tar

1253
01:28:53,400 --> 01:28:56,880
Come on along
Not goin' very far

1254
01:28:56,920 --> 01:29:00,600
To the East
to meet the czar, yeah

1255
01:29:07,120 --> 01:29:09,920
By a right line, the running line,
the crooked and the straight...

1256
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:11,520
I summon you up.

1257
01:29:11,600 --> 01:29:16,640
By wood and stone, wind and fire,
land and water, I bring you in.

1258
01:29:16,720 --> 01:29:19,800
We worship the ancient forces
of nature.

1259
01:29:19,880 --> 01:29:22,160
The Great Mother,
the Triple Goddess...

1260
01:29:22,200 --> 01:29:24,560
and the Horned One,
god of the hunt.

1261
01:29:25,640 --> 01:29:27,040
Death does not part...

1262
01:29:27,120 --> 01:29:29,120
only lack of love.

1263
01:29:29,200 --> 01:29:30,800
The goddess holds the vow forever.

1264
01:29:32,160 --> 01:29:33,840
Run with me

1265
01:29:35,560 --> 01:29:37,400
Run with me

1266
01:29:42,360 --> 01:29:43,440
Let's run

1267
01:30:58,640 --> 01:31:02,000
The outlaws live
by the side of the lake

1268
01:31:02,080 --> 01:31:05,200
The minister's daughter's
in love with a snake

1269
01:31:05,280 --> 01:31:09,200
Who lives in a well
by the side of the road

1270
01:31:09,240 --> 01:31:12,880
Wake up, girl
We're almost home, yeah

1271
01:31:16,640 --> 01:31:18,960
We could see the gates
by morning

1272
01:31:22,880 --> 01:31:25,760
We should be inside
by evening

1273
01:31:29,280 --> 01:31:31,480
Sun, sun, sun

1274
01:31:35,680 --> 01:31:37,240
Moon, moon, moon

1275
01:31:41,160 --> 01:31:44,320
I will gain you

1276
01:31:44,360 --> 01:31:46,080
Soon

1277
01:32:00,680 --> 01:32:02,680
I am the lizard king.

1278
01:32:04,280 --> 01:32:06,520
I can do anything.

1279
01:32:41,800 --> 01:32:45,880
Come on, come on, come on
Come on now, touch me, babe

1280
01:32:45,960 --> 01:32:49,880
Can't you see
that I am not afraid

1281
01:32:51,080 --> 01:32:53,960
What was that promise
that you made

1282
01:32:55,240 --> 01:32:59,160
Why won't you tell me
what she said

1283
01:33:00,720 --> 01:33:04,200
Fuckin' Neanderthal prima donna.
Too drunk to fuckin' sing.

1284
01:33:04,280 --> 01:33:08,000
I'm gonna love you

1285
01:33:08,080 --> 01:33:12,600
'Til the heavens
stop the rain

1286
01:33:12,680 --> 01:33:16,360
I'm gonna love you

1287
01:33:16,400 --> 01:33:20,640
'Til the stars
fall from the sky

1288
01:33:20,720 --> 01:33:22,280
You and I

1289
01:33:22,320 --> 01:33:24,200
Cut. Cut.

1290
01:33:25,400 --> 01:33:28,800
Terrific take, Jim. We just had
a technical problem in here.

1291
01:33:28,880 --> 01:33:31,160
What's his fuckin' problem, man?

1292
01:33:31,240 --> 01:33:33,840
- Paul, babe.
- Yeah, right here, babe.

1293
01:33:33,880 --> 01:33:36,080
Suck a fart
out of my asshole...

1294
01:33:36,160 --> 01:33:38,200
you slave-driving fascist...

1295
01:33:41,840 --> 01:33:44,640
- I hear the booze, the smoke.
- Sixty-seven takes?

1296
01:33:44,720 --> 01:33:47,760
- I don't hear your voice or the song.
- Because it's stale!

1297
01:33:47,840 --> 01:33:49,680
- "Stale"?
- I wanna do my thing!

1298
01:33:49,760 --> 01:33:52,760
We'll do 167 takes
until it sounds like music.

1299
01:33:52,880 --> 01:33:56,680
Let's do something else.
You're all a bunch of fuckin' slaves.

1300
01:33:56,800 --> 01:33:58,280
Let's do...

1301
01:33:58,360 --> 01:34:00,560
Come on, come on, come on.

1302
01:34:00,640 --> 01:34:02,040
Rock is dead.

1303
01:34:02,120 --> 01:34:05,400
Everybody come out here.
We'll do a sing-along.

1304
01:34:05,520 --> 01:34:08,360
O come, all ye faithful

1305
01:34:08,400 --> 01:34:11,240
- Get this circus outta here.
- It's too self-conscious.

1306
01:34:12,360 --> 01:34:15,640
Billy, get 'em out!
You, you, you! Let's go!

1307
01:34:15,760 --> 01:34:17,600
You deaf? Beat it!
Let's go!

1308
01:34:17,680 --> 01:34:18,960
See you later.

1309
01:34:20,040 --> 01:34:21,880
What are you doing, Jim?

1310
01:34:21,960 --> 01:34:25,200
I'm sitting in
that fuckin' booth for months.

1311
01:34:25,280 --> 01:34:28,800
I look out of the glass,
I see Jim, I hear Jim...

1312
01:34:28,880 --> 01:34:31,000
but I miss him.

1313
01:34:31,080 --> 01:34:34,840
And he's standing right in front of me.
How do you explain that?

1314
01:34:36,760 --> 01:34:39,640
Don't make me go through
this whole shit again...

1315
01:34:39,720 --> 01:34:42,960
watching Janis dive to the bottom
of a bottle of Southern Comfort.

1316
01:34:43,040 --> 01:34:45,440
I won't go through it again.

1317
01:34:46,480 --> 01:34:48,320
Why are you fucking this up?

1318
01:34:51,840 --> 01:34:55,880
I love you, man.
You're my own flesh and blood.

1319
01:34:59,520 --> 01:35:01,200
Catchy tune.

1320
01:35:02,160 --> 01:35:04,000
You sold it to a commercial?

1321
01:35:09,360 --> 01:35:11,240
- How much?
- Seventy-five thousand.

1322
01:35:11,280 --> 01:35:13,520
We couldn't reach you.
We figured...

1323
01:35:13,600 --> 01:35:17,040
- What is this shit, Ray?
- It's not a big deal, man.

1324
01:35:17,080 --> 01:35:18,960
The song has already
been commercialized.

1325
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:21,360
Feliciano's already sold
two million copies.

1326
01:35:22,640 --> 01:35:25,440
Robbie thought it was a good idea.
So did John.

1327
01:35:25,520 --> 01:35:26,720
So did I.

1328
01:35:27,720 --> 01:35:29,120
Robbie?

1329
01:35:32,120 --> 01:35:34,480
Where were you?
You should've been here.

1330
01:35:36,800 --> 01:35:40,560
Do you know what you're saying
to millions of people?

1331
01:35:40,600 --> 01:35:45,040
The Doors... all for one,
one for all... not real.

1332
01:35:47,560 --> 01:35:50,160
It's not about money...

1333
01:35:50,240 --> 01:35:52,080
or records or success...

1334
01:35:52,160 --> 01:35:54,000
or these...

1335
01:35:54,080 --> 01:35:56,040
desires that you have.

1336
01:35:56,120 --> 01:35:57,960
It's about...

1337
01:35:59,240 --> 01:36:01,200
using the music to break through.

1338
01:36:01,280 --> 01:36:03,120
Wasn't it, Ray?

1339
01:36:05,600 --> 01:36:06,960
I don't know.

1340
01:36:08,560 --> 01:36:10,440
We lost something here, man.

1341
01:36:10,480 --> 01:36:12,360
I don't think so, Jim.

1342
01:36:13,440 --> 01:36:15,960
There's just a bigger picture,
that's all.

1343
01:36:16,040 --> 01:36:17,600
Yeah?

1344
01:36:17,640 --> 01:36:18,960
In your fucking face!

1345
01:36:20,880 --> 01:36:22,960
Jesus Fuckin' Christ!

1346
01:36:23,040 --> 01:36:25,080
What the fuck is goin' on, man?

1347
01:36:27,600 --> 01:36:29,320
Just kidding.

1348
01:36:30,360 --> 01:36:32,240
Oh, hi, honey.

1349
01:36:33,680 --> 01:36:36,520
We were just watching
a little TV.

1350
01:36:36,560 --> 01:36:39,440
I wanted you to find us, Jim.
It meant nothing.

1351
01:36:43,240 --> 01:36:45,400
You don't have to torture me.

1352
01:36:45,480 --> 01:36:48,280
Just let me make it up to you.

1353
01:36:55,400 --> 01:36:57,000
I love you.

1354
01:36:57,040 --> 01:36:59,640
It's gonna be all right.

1355
01:36:59,720 --> 01:37:01,080
You're the one.

1356
01:37:02,160 --> 01:37:04,040
- Really?
- You're my girl.

1357
01:37:06,480 --> 01:37:09,320
So vulnerable about everything,
it makes me sad.

1358
01:37:10,600 --> 01:37:13,720
All right, let's keep
that money machine rolling.

1359
01:37:19,160 --> 01:37:22,200
Can you find me

1360
01:37:22,280 --> 01:37:25,280
Soft asylum

1361
01:37:25,360 --> 01:37:28,640
I can't make it

1362
01:37:28,720 --> 01:37:30,920
Anymore

1363
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:32,880
The man is

1364
01:37:32,920 --> 01:37:37,200
At the door

1365
01:37:41,640 --> 01:37:43,640
This is the trip, the best part...

1366
01:37:43,720 --> 01:37:45,560
I really like.

1367
01:37:48,680 --> 01:37:52,400
Yeah, I'm proud to be
a part of this number!

1368
01:37:55,440 --> 01:37:59,080
Successful hills
are here to stay

1369
01:38:00,240 --> 01:38:03,440
Everything must be this way

1370
01:38:04,760 --> 01:38:08,240
All our lives
we sweat and save

1371
01:38:09,400 --> 01:38:12,880
Buildin' for a shallow grave

1372
01:38:15,760 --> 01:38:19,600
The soft parade has now begun

1373
01:38:20,720 --> 01:38:22,880
Cobra on my left

1374
01:38:22,960 --> 01:38:26,480
Leopard on my right, yeah

1375
01:38:29,120 --> 01:38:31,040
Come on

1376
01:38:32,080 --> 01:38:36,360
And it's getting harder

1377
01:38:36,440 --> 01:38:38,840
Callin' on the dogs

1378
01:38:38,960 --> 01:38:40,800
When all else fails

1379
01:38:40,880 --> 01:38:43,840
We can whip the horses' eyes

1380
01:38:43,920 --> 01:38:46,800
And make them sleep

1381
01:38:46,920 --> 01:38:48,440
And cry

1382
01:38:51,320 --> 01:38:53,160
I love you.

1383
01:38:58,880 --> 01:39:00,920
Hate your next-door neighbor

1384
01:39:01,040 --> 01:39:03,360
But don't forget to say grace and

1385
01:39:03,440 --> 01:39:06,160
Tell me over and over

1386
01:39:06,240 --> 01:39:09,600
And over and over again, my friend

1387
01:39:09,680 --> 01:39:11,920
You don't believe

1388
01:39:11,960 --> 01:39:15,920
We're on the eve of destruction

1389
01:39:17,400 --> 01:39:19,640
A hot night in Miami, March '69.

1390
01:39:19,720 --> 01:39:21,880
Every space in the auditorium
is consumed.

1391
01:39:21,960 --> 01:39:25,000
Unfortunately, The Doors have long
since sold out. They've become an act.

1392
01:39:25,040 --> 01:39:28,200
Morrison falls off the stage
at least every other performance.

1393
01:39:28,280 --> 01:39:31,920
"The Soft Parade" album only confirms
the plasticity of their approach.

1394
01:39:31,960 --> 01:39:34,280
Songs like "Touch Me"
and "Tell All the People"...

1395
01:39:34,320 --> 01:39:36,280
are not the Doors we once knew.

1396
01:39:36,360 --> 01:39:38,640
So the question is:
why am I here?

1397
01:39:38,720 --> 01:39:41,040
Are funerals entertainment?

1398
01:39:41,080 --> 01:39:43,640
- He's not going to show.
- Show time is show time.

1399
01:39:43,720 --> 01:39:46,440
This guy's done it to us too many times.
We should go on without him.

1400
01:39:46,520 --> 01:39:49,960
Bill is with him. They're an hour away.
He'll get him here, all right?

1401
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:53,280
He fucking better
get him here, man.

1402
01:39:53,360 --> 01:39:55,840
- Hey, he'll be here.
- I'll tell you one goddamn thing.

1403
01:39:55,920 --> 01:39:58,480
There's gonna be a show here tonight
if I gotta throw a wig on, man...

1404
01:39:58,520 --> 01:40:00,080
and sing them songs myself.

1405
01:40:00,160 --> 01:40:02,320
Yeah, fuck off.

1406
01:40:02,400 --> 01:40:04,920
How's it going?

1407
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:07,280
- Hey, dude.
- Yo, Jimbo.

1408
01:40:07,320 --> 01:40:09,720
- Clean up your act.
- You asshole.

1409
01:40:09,800 --> 01:40:12,440
I love you!
Hey, listen, Paul.

1410
01:40:12,520 --> 01:40:14,400
- Can you get us some heroin?
- No.

1411
01:40:14,480 --> 01:40:17,160
Why not? Some heroin.

1412
01:40:17,240 --> 01:40:19,000
I am not gonna participate
in anything...

1413
01:40:19,080 --> 01:40:21,400
that's gonna help you
accomplish your goal, Jim.

1414
01:40:21,480 --> 01:40:23,480
What's my goal, Paul?

1415
01:40:24,280 --> 01:40:27,840
Your only friend, the end

1416
01:40:27,880 --> 01:40:32,080
Wrong. I just want to
sing the blues, man.

1417
01:40:32,120 --> 01:40:35,880
Get fat, do nothin', go nowhere.
Just be.

1418
01:40:35,960 --> 01:40:37,640
With that waistline,
you ain't got much choice.

1419
01:40:37,680 --> 01:40:40,160
What is wrong with being
a large mammal?

1420
01:40:40,240 --> 01:40:44,160
- A big beast, like a tank.
- You're king crawling flab.

1421
01:40:44,240 --> 01:40:46,320
Rock is cock, baby,
and your rock is dying.

1422
01:40:46,360 --> 01:40:50,120
Rock is death, man.
There's no longer belief.

1423
01:40:50,160 --> 01:40:52,240
I'll write poetry...

1424
01:40:52,280 --> 01:40:54,680
and direct movies.

1425
01:40:54,760 --> 01:40:55,960
That's bullshit.

1426
01:40:56,040 --> 01:40:59,120
You tested all the limits...
fame, fucking...

1427
01:40:59,160 --> 01:41:00,400
money.

1428
01:41:00,440 --> 01:41:02,880
What you gonna do
when the music's over, man...

1429
01:41:02,960 --> 01:41:06,080
when you're too fat and old
to go out onstage?

1430
01:41:06,160 --> 01:41:10,000
What you gonna do for act three?
Puke on heaven's door?

1431
01:41:10,040 --> 01:41:12,440
Listen, you two-bit fucking actor.

1432
01:41:12,520 --> 01:41:14,480
You underestimate the audience.

1433
01:41:14,520 --> 01:41:16,880
Face it, Jim.
You're not gonna be remembered.

1434
01:41:16,960 --> 01:41:19,600
You think all they want is...

1435
01:41:19,680 --> 01:41:22,640
two cars and a house.

1436
01:41:22,720 --> 01:41:24,040
But you're wrong.

1437
01:41:24,080 --> 01:41:25,960
- You know what they want?
- No. Tell me.

1438
01:41:26,040 --> 01:41:29,240
- You really want to know?
- Yeah, tell me. What?

1439
01:41:29,320 --> 01:41:31,920
Something sacred.

1440
01:41:31,960 --> 01:41:34,160
That's what they want.

1441
01:41:34,200 --> 01:41:35,960
Something sacred.

1442
01:41:41,840 --> 01:41:44,480
- He's two hours late!
- Where the fuck are the seats?

1443
01:41:44,560 --> 01:41:47,600
- I took them out.
- How are you doin'?

1444
01:41:47,640 --> 01:41:49,080
I'd like you to meet
my new friend.

1445
01:41:49,160 --> 01:41:51,520
- You're not playing, huh?
- We're gonna sue your fucking ass.

1446
01:41:51,600 --> 01:41:55,320
So sue me. If you ain't playing,
see where your equipment is tomorrow.

1447
01:41:55,400 --> 01:41:57,520
I'm not going out there until
I get some sort of guarantee.

1448
01:41:58,600 --> 01:42:01,320
Come on, John. How will you know
what could have been?

1449
01:42:01,400 --> 01:42:03,800
How will you know
unless you break on through?

1450
01:42:03,880 --> 01:42:05,680
Fucking asshole!

1451
01:42:05,720 --> 01:42:07,440
You're pushing death, Morrison.

1452
01:42:07,520 --> 01:42:09,360
People think we're drug addicts
because of you.

1453
01:42:09,440 --> 01:42:12,880
- Are we the Beatles now, John?
- We took drugs to expand our mind.

1454
01:42:12,960 --> 01:42:15,480
- Not to escape.
- Get him on the fucking stage!

1455
01:42:15,560 --> 01:42:17,440
Listen.

1456
01:42:17,480 --> 01:42:19,720
Have you ever eaten human flesh?

1457
01:42:19,760 --> 01:42:23,440
'Cause I know this chick
in New York, man.

1458
01:42:23,480 --> 01:42:25,360
Hey, it's cool.

1459
01:42:25,440 --> 01:42:27,800
Listen, listen.

1460
01:42:29,560 --> 01:42:32,200
Just one more time,
for old times' sake.

1461
01:42:32,280 --> 01:42:35,240
- I don't want any.
- You'll play like an orgasm.

1462
01:42:35,320 --> 01:42:37,160
Trust me.

1463
01:42:41,760 --> 01:42:43,680
You said you loved pain.

1464
01:42:43,760 --> 01:42:46,280
You run from it
every chance you get.

1465
01:42:49,320 --> 01:42:51,720
Doors! Doors! Doors!

1466
01:43:15,880 --> 01:43:18,000
Are you ready?

1467
01:43:30,440 --> 01:43:32,240
Back off!

1468
01:43:33,320 --> 01:43:35,840
I don't want to see
any more of that shit!

1469
01:43:35,920 --> 01:43:38,280
I'll haul your ass in, pal.

1470
01:43:40,240 --> 01:43:42,640
Hey, Jim!

1471
01:43:50,360 --> 01:43:53,240
Five to one, baby

1472
01:43:53,320 --> 01:43:56,040
One in five

1473
01:43:56,080 --> 01:44:01,320
No one here gets out alive now

1474
01:44:01,360 --> 01:44:04,040
You get yours, baby

1475
01:44:04,080 --> 01:44:06,040
I'll get mine

1476
01:44:07,280 --> 01:44:11,000
Gonna make it, baby
if we try

1477
01:44:22,200 --> 01:44:24,600
The old get older

1478
01:44:24,680 --> 01:44:28,080
The young get stronger

1479
01:44:28,120 --> 01:44:33,320
May take a week
and it may take longer

1480
01:44:33,360 --> 01:44:38,520
They got the guns
but we got the numbers

1481
01:44:39,240 --> 01:44:43,240
Gonna win, yeah
We're takin' over

1482
01:44:43,280 --> 01:44:45,800
Come on!

1483
01:44:45,840 --> 01:44:48,040
Let me hear ya!

1484
01:45:08,760 --> 01:45:11,160
Look at this beautiful
living thing, man.

1485
01:45:11,240 --> 01:45:13,600
You wouldn't eat
my little friend, would you?

1486
01:45:13,680 --> 01:45:15,520
Come on, man.

1487
01:45:15,600 --> 01:45:18,440
Love animals.
Don't eat them!

1488
01:45:18,480 --> 01:45:20,240
I'd fuck her, but she's too young.

1489
01:45:30,480 --> 01:45:32,720
Your ballroom days

1490
01:45:32,800 --> 01:45:36,480
Are over, baby

1491
01:45:36,520 --> 01:45:39,560
Night is drawing near

1492
01:45:41,760 --> 01:45:45,480
Shadows of the evening

1493
01:45:47,040 --> 01:45:50,600
Crawl across the year

1494
01:45:50,640 --> 01:45:53,560
You walk across the floor

1495
01:45:53,640 --> 01:45:56,240
With a flower in your hand

1496
01:45:57,640 --> 01:46:01,960
Trying to tell me
no one understands

1497
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:04,200
Trade in your house

1498
01:46:04,240 --> 01:46:08,000
For a handful of dimes

1499
01:46:08,080 --> 01:46:10,160
Gonna make it, baby

1500
01:46:10,240 --> 01:46:13,560
In our prime

1501
01:46:13,640 --> 01:46:15,640
Get together

1502
01:46:15,720 --> 01:46:17,360
One more time

1503
01:46:19,160 --> 01:46:21,120
Get together

1504
01:46:21,200 --> 01:46:22,880
One more time

1505
01:47:17,840 --> 01:47:21,360
You're all a bunch
of fucking slaves!

1506
01:47:24,400 --> 01:47:27,240
How long you think
it's going to last?

1507
01:47:27,280 --> 01:47:30,280
How long are you gonna let 'em
push you around?

1508
01:47:30,400 --> 01:47:32,280
I'll tell you this.

1509
01:47:32,360 --> 01:47:36,200
I'm gonna get my kicks before
the whole shithouse goes up in flames.

1510
01:47:36,280 --> 01:47:38,160
All right.

1511
01:47:40,720 --> 01:47:43,240
"Light My Fire!" Come on, Jim!

1512
01:47:45,600 --> 01:47:46,720
Fuck you, man!

1513
01:47:46,800 --> 01:47:50,120
That's the word.
That's the very little word.

1514
01:47:50,160 --> 01:47:54,640
Come on, let me hear it.
All your little hatred.

1515
01:47:54,760 --> 01:47:57,600
You'd all eat shit, wouldn't ya?

1516
01:48:01,040 --> 01:48:05,280
Adolf Hitler is alive and well
and living in Miami.

1517
01:48:06,560 --> 01:48:08,960
I fucked her last night.

1518
01:48:11,360 --> 01:48:12,880
What are you gonna do about it?

1519
01:48:28,360 --> 01:48:32,360
Come on, come on, come on
Come on and suck me, babe

1520
01:48:32,440 --> 01:48:37,200
Can't you see
that I need some head

1521
01:48:37,240 --> 01:48:40,880
What was that...
Wait a minute. Ah, bullshit!

1522
01:48:40,960 --> 01:48:44,520
It's fucked up, man.
It's all bullshit!

1523
01:48:44,560 --> 01:48:47,200
It's all fucked up.
I'm coming out!

1524
01:48:48,400 --> 01:48:50,440
Miami Beach, Florida, huh?

1525
01:48:53,520 --> 01:48:56,800
Hey, I went to Florida State.

1526
01:48:56,880 --> 01:49:00,400
Then I got smart
and moved to California.

1527
01:49:00,440 --> 01:49:05,040
They're trying to change the world
out there in California.

1528
01:49:05,080 --> 01:49:08,160
No, I ain't talkin' about
no revolution.

1529
01:49:08,240 --> 01:49:12,000
I'm talkin' about having
a good time this summer.

1530
01:49:13,200 --> 01:49:16,960
I'm talking about love your neighbor
until it hurts.

1531
01:49:18,200 --> 01:49:20,840
Come on.
How 'bout a little nakedness?

1532
01:49:23,080 --> 01:49:26,080
Come on. Let's see
some action out there.

1533
01:49:26,160 --> 01:49:30,040
I'm talkin' about love, love, love.

1534
01:49:31,680 --> 01:49:35,920
I'm talkin' about
you and me lovin'...

1535
01:49:47,040 --> 01:49:49,840
Anybody gonna come up here
and love my ass?

1536
01:49:49,920 --> 01:49:52,560
Come on. I'm lonely up here.

1537
01:49:52,600 --> 01:49:54,360
I love you!

1538
01:49:54,440 --> 01:49:56,320
Come on, sweetheart.
You want to see it?

1539
01:49:56,400 --> 01:50:00,240
Why don't I pull it out for you,
shake it around a little bit?

1540
01:50:01,320 --> 01:50:03,520
Will that do it for ya?

1541
01:50:05,040 --> 01:50:07,680
All right, now.
I'm gonna show it to you.

1542
01:50:14,680 --> 01:50:16,200
You see it?

1543
01:50:18,640 --> 01:50:21,400
Yeah, I saw it!

1544
01:50:21,480 --> 01:50:23,440
I wanna see some action out there!

1545
01:50:29,280 --> 01:50:31,400
No limits! No laws!

1546
01:50:31,440 --> 01:50:33,800
You want to fuck?
Come on up here!

1547
01:50:33,840 --> 01:50:37,040
- This is your show! Yeah!
- Get off my stage, motherfucker!

1548
01:50:37,120 --> 01:50:39,720
No laws! No limits!

1549
01:50:41,080 --> 01:50:43,880
Yeah! Fuckin' rock god!

1550
01:50:52,840 --> 01:50:55,800
Where's the guy with the penis?
Where's that son of a bitch? Get back!

1551
01:50:58,320 --> 01:51:00,560
Fat cat in a top hat

1552
01:51:07,960 --> 01:51:09,840
Dead cat in a top hat

1553
01:51:13,600 --> 01:51:16,560
Suckin' on a young man's

1554
01:51:16,640 --> 01:51:18,000
Love

1555
01:51:20,400 --> 01:51:23,040
Wishin' he could come, yeah

1556
01:51:25,400 --> 01:51:28,080
Suckin' on a soldier's brain

1557
01:51:30,360 --> 01:51:33,120
Wishin' it would be the same

1558
01:51:39,240 --> 01:51:42,520
Dead rats
See, you're an aristocrat

1559
01:51:44,720 --> 01:51:47,120
Well, that's crap

1560
01:51:47,200 --> 01:51:50,040
You know, the day
destroy the night

1561
01:51:50,120 --> 01:51:52,600
Night divide the day

1562
01:51:52,720 --> 01:51:55,320
Try to run, try to hide

1563
01:51:55,440 --> 01:51:57,680
Break on through
to the other side

1564
01:52:05,480 --> 01:52:07,320
Come on!

1565
01:52:08,440 --> 01:52:10,760
Chased our pleasures here

1566
01:52:10,800 --> 01:52:12,880
Dug our treasures there

1567
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:16,280
Can you still recall
the time we cried

1568
01:52:16,360 --> 01:52:18,280
Break on through to...

1569
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:39,760
Mr. Morrison.

1570
01:52:39,840 --> 01:52:43,000
You are charged with lewd behavior
on four counts.

1571
01:52:43,080 --> 01:52:47,000
Simulated masturbation...

1572
01:52:47,080 --> 01:52:48,920
public drunkenness...

1573
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:51,360
profanity...

1574
01:52:52,400 --> 01:52:54,280
and public exposure.

1575
01:52:55,440 --> 01:52:57,120
How do you plead?

1576
01:52:57,160 --> 01:52:59,040
The defendant pleads not guilty,
Your Honor.

1577
01:52:59,120 --> 01:53:00,680
Then trial is set for the week...

1578
01:53:00,720 --> 01:53:04,560
I want to bring to the jury's attention
that there's playing now on Broadway...

1579
01:53:04,640 --> 01:53:07,120
a musical called "Hair"
where the actors disrobe...

1580
01:53:07,160 --> 01:53:09,200
and appear naked on the stage.

1581
01:53:09,240 --> 01:53:12,360
- Objection. That's irrelevant.
- Sustained.

1582
01:53:12,440 --> 01:53:14,360
Your Honor,
how can you sustain that?

1583
01:53:14,440 --> 01:53:16,280
Stick to the facts.

1584
01:53:16,360 --> 01:53:18,520
This is a major
First Amendment violation...

1585
01:53:18,600 --> 01:53:21,040
by the politicians
and the police of Miami.

1586
01:53:21,120 --> 01:53:23,320
Every single witness
they've brought here...

1587
01:53:23,400 --> 01:53:26,880
has testified to not actually seeing
my client's genitals...

1588
01:53:26,920 --> 01:53:30,320
except one, who is related
to the arresting officer.

1589
01:53:30,360 --> 01:53:33,560
I tell you, if you convict
on such lack of evidence...

1590
01:53:33,640 --> 01:53:37,680
I assure you that someday, somewhere
in the still of the night...

1591
01:53:37,760 --> 01:53:40,280
you will wake up screaming.

1592
01:53:45,640 --> 01:53:47,960
Are you gonna get rid of it?

1593
01:53:52,560 --> 01:53:54,680
Look.

1594
01:53:54,760 --> 01:53:59,440
Wouldn't it be better to have a kid with
someone who wanted to be its father?

1595
01:53:59,480 --> 01:54:02,320
It'd be a fucking genius.
That's what it'd be.

1596
01:54:04,200 --> 01:54:06,360
You and me?

1597
01:54:06,440 --> 01:54:08,880
The child would be a goddess...

1598
01:54:08,960 --> 01:54:11,400
or a god.

1599
01:54:11,440 --> 01:54:13,320
It'd be a monster.

1600
01:54:16,360 --> 01:54:18,560
No. Look.

1601
01:54:18,640 --> 01:54:21,240
I got this trial
that's hanging on me.

1602
01:54:21,320 --> 01:54:25,240
I can't afford this.
I don't want the responsibility.

1603
01:54:25,320 --> 01:54:28,880
You're a coward,
just a little boy!

1604
01:54:28,960 --> 01:54:31,680
The only way you can't afford it
is emotionally!

1605
01:54:31,720 --> 01:54:35,240
Those vows were forever
in the goddess' sight!

1606
01:54:35,320 --> 01:54:38,480
"Death does not part,
only lack of love."

1607
01:54:38,560 --> 01:54:40,560
Come on, Patricia.

1608
01:54:40,640 --> 01:54:42,680
I was stoned.

1609
01:54:44,280 --> 01:54:47,000
It seemed like a fun thing
to do at the time.

1610
01:54:50,120 --> 01:54:53,640
Fuck you.
I'm gonna have the kid.

1611
01:54:53,680 --> 01:54:56,600
Well, then it will be your kid.

1612
01:54:56,680 --> 01:54:59,600
But if you want the abortion,
I'll be there with you.

1613
01:54:59,640 --> 01:55:01,400
- Oh, no, you won't.
- Yes, I will.

1614
01:55:01,480 --> 01:55:04,280
Bullshit, Morrison!
You know who you are!

1615
01:55:06,880 --> 01:55:09,760
What difference
does it make, you know?

1616
01:55:09,840 --> 01:55:11,800
You never pretended.

1617
01:55:12,920 --> 01:55:14,840
I did.

1618
01:55:14,920 --> 01:55:17,720
Yeah, I don't even like kids,
particularly.

1619
01:55:18,880 --> 01:55:21,800
I don't want the other
fuckin' thing either.

1620
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:27,160
Well.

1621
01:55:29,400 --> 01:55:32,680
Have you looked in the mirror lately?

1622
01:55:32,720 --> 01:55:35,880
- Look at that stomach.
- Come on, now.

1623
01:55:35,960 --> 01:55:38,080
Don't say these things.

1624
01:55:56,240 --> 01:55:59,760
James Douglas Morrison...

1625
01:55:59,840 --> 01:56:02,000
I hereby sentence you...

1626
01:56:02,080 --> 01:56:05,080
to six months of hard labor
in the Dade County jail.

1627
01:56:05,160 --> 01:56:06,800
And for public exposure...

1628
01:56:06,920 --> 01:56:10,200
I'm sentencing you
to 60 days of the same...

1629
01:56:10,280 --> 01:56:13,600
after which you are to serve
two years and four months...

1630
01:56:13,680 --> 01:56:15,680
of probationary time.

1631
01:56:15,760 --> 01:56:18,960
Your Honor, I have an appellate bond
in the sum of $50,000 here.

1632
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:21,880
I ask that Mr. Morrison remain free,
pending his appeal.

1633
01:56:28,840 --> 01:56:32,600
Everywhere, Jim... Jacksonville, Dallas,
even Kent State University canceled.

1634
01:56:32,720 --> 01:56:35,120
The press for the first time
turned against us. We're fucked.

1635
01:56:35,200 --> 01:56:39,120
Pamela's called six times.
Katherine, Patricia. Gayle's pregnant.

1636
01:56:39,240 --> 01:56:41,200
You gotta go to the dentist.
Look, Jim.

1637
01:56:41,320 --> 01:56:43,040
Go home, get some sleep.

1638
01:56:43,120 --> 01:56:46,240
- Wash your hair.
- Take a bath too, man.

1639
01:56:46,320 --> 01:56:49,360
- Jesus, this guy really despises you.
- We weren't even invited to Woodstock.

1640
01:56:49,480 --> 01:56:50,960
Twenty other bands. Not us.

1641
01:56:51,080 --> 01:56:52,760
First Hendrix, now Janis.

1642
01:56:52,880 --> 01:56:55,320
Radio stations won't play us.
Some big cities.

1643
01:56:55,440 --> 01:56:57,680
Philly, Cinci, Chicago, Detroit.

1644
01:56:57,760 --> 01:56:59,720
We can drag this appeal out for years,
keep you out of jail.

1645
01:56:59,760 --> 01:57:02,640
The F.B.I. 's behind it.
They had memos on you in Phoenix.

1646
01:57:02,720 --> 01:57:04,600
They extradited you to Miami.

1647
01:57:04,680 --> 01:57:05,800
A new image.

1648
01:57:05,840 --> 01:57:08,880
Slow, quiet. The beard.
The elder of the tribe.

1649
01:57:12,440 --> 01:57:16,240
Mine eyes have seen the glory
of the coming of the Lord!

1650
01:57:17,480 --> 01:57:18,680
The band you love to hate.

1651
01:57:18,760 --> 01:57:20,120
Let's win there.

1652
01:57:21,120 --> 01:57:22,120
It was fun.

1653
01:57:29,960 --> 01:57:32,920
I think I'm having
a nervous breakdown.

1654
01:57:36,400 --> 01:57:39,280
- Do you hear me?
- Climb on the edge, baby.

1655
01:57:39,320 --> 01:57:41,240
We're rolling, Jim.

1656
01:57:41,320 --> 01:57:43,280
- Jump!
- Let him dance a little bit.

1657
01:57:43,360 --> 01:57:46,840
I want you to come back in here
this minute, Jim Morrison.

1658
01:57:46,920 --> 01:57:49,040
I am not gonna kill myself for you.

1659
01:57:49,120 --> 01:57:52,320
- Goddamn it, Jim!
- Your whole life is bullshit!

1660
01:57:52,400 --> 01:57:55,080
- Shut up!
- You want me, come out and get me!

1661
01:57:55,120 --> 01:57:56,600
Oh, no!

1662
01:57:56,680 --> 01:57:59,240
Jim, where are you...
Pam, get back inside!

1663
01:57:59,280 --> 01:58:02,680
- I love you.
- Come out here, honey.

1664
01:58:03,840 --> 01:58:06,400
- Come on, baby.
- Jim, give her your hand.

1665
01:58:06,440 --> 01:58:09,480
- She's gonna fall.
- Once more with feeling.

1666
01:58:09,520 --> 01:58:10,800
Take two.

1667
01:58:10,880 --> 01:58:14,080
- I don't want to die.
- Man, we gotta finish it.

1668
01:58:14,160 --> 01:58:17,440
- We don't have an ending, Ray.
- All the poetry has wolves in it.

1669
01:58:17,480 --> 01:58:20,000
- The most beautiful...
- Come on, girl.

1670
01:58:20,040 --> 01:58:23,320
I see your hair is burning

1671
01:58:23,400 --> 01:58:25,960
The most beautiful one of all...

1672
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:29,000
dances in a ring of fire...

1673
01:58:29,040 --> 01:58:32,480
then throws off a challenge
with a shrug.

1674
01:58:32,560 --> 01:58:34,320
That's my girl.

1675
01:58:35,960 --> 01:58:38,880
Let's go. Let's leave this place.

1676
01:58:38,960 --> 01:58:40,880
Just you and me, baby.

1677
01:58:40,960 --> 01:58:43,080
We can, you know.

1678
01:58:44,240 --> 01:58:45,600
Just one more step.

1679
01:58:49,080 --> 01:58:50,400
I want to live!

1680
01:58:50,440 --> 01:58:52,800
I want to live with you!

1681
01:58:55,600 --> 01:58:58,680
All the poetry
has wolves in it, Pam.

1682
01:58:59,520 --> 01:59:01,360
All but one.

1683
01:59:02,960 --> 01:59:05,760
The most beautiful one of all.

1684
01:59:06,800 --> 01:59:09,760
I hope you go out smiling...

1685
01:59:09,840 --> 01:59:13,520
like a child
into the cool remnant of a dream.

1686
01:59:16,080 --> 01:59:18,800
The angel man...

1687
01:59:18,880 --> 01:59:22,480
has finally claimed
this benevolent soul.

1688
01:59:23,520 --> 01:59:25,720
Ophelia...

1689
01:59:25,800 --> 01:59:29,200
leaves sudden in silk.

1690
01:59:29,240 --> 01:59:31,160
Glory in dream.

1691
01:59:32,400 --> 01:59:34,800
Mad, stifled witness.

1692
01:59:54,600 --> 01:59:56,240
All right!

1693
01:59:57,560 --> 01:59:59,640
Hi, Dorothy.
Oh, you cut your hair.

1694
01:59:59,720 --> 02:00:03,000
- We're trying to have another baby.
- Was your hair getting in the way?

1695
02:00:04,320 --> 02:00:06,440
Where's Ray?
I got to catch a plane.

1696
02:00:06,480 --> 02:00:08,280
He's upstairs.

1697
02:00:08,360 --> 02:00:11,040
- Where's Princess?
- Out back.

1698
02:00:15,160 --> 02:00:17,840
We added a rain effect
to "Riders," man.

1699
02:00:17,920 --> 02:00:19,760
It's great.

1700
02:00:21,440 --> 02:00:24,280
It's the best album
since "Days," man.

1701
02:00:25,560 --> 02:00:27,960
I must admit it's pretty good...

1702
02:00:28,080 --> 02:00:31,120
for four guys who weren't even
talking to each other that day.

1703
02:00:32,440 --> 02:00:35,160
So you're really gonna live
in Paris, huh, man?

1704
02:00:35,240 --> 02:00:38,080
Yeah. You know, be anonymous,
write a book.

1705
02:00:40,040 --> 02:00:43,680
"Observations of an American
While On Trial in Miami."

1706
02:00:43,760 --> 02:00:45,640
Still got a lot
of good songs in you.

1707
02:00:45,680 --> 02:00:48,160
Still think we got a couple
of blues albums in us.

1708
02:00:48,240 --> 02:00:49,600
I'm pinned, man.

1709
02:00:49,640 --> 02:00:52,640
They got a category
for everything we do.

1710
02:00:53,960 --> 02:00:55,800
I'm a wanted man.

1711
02:00:59,200 --> 02:01:01,640
I'm gonna miss you, man.

1712
02:01:01,720 --> 02:01:05,520
I'm gonna miss that feeling
of playing music with you, man.

1713
02:01:05,600 --> 02:01:07,800
You, John, miss me?

1714
02:01:07,880 --> 02:01:10,480
More than you think, asshole.

1715
02:01:10,600 --> 02:01:12,320
Yeah.

1716
02:01:12,400 --> 02:01:14,920
You can always whip
the horses' eyes.

1717
02:01:18,160 --> 02:01:20,560
As far as I'm concerned...

1718
02:01:20,640 --> 02:01:23,120
I made music with Dionysus.

1719
02:01:24,480 --> 02:01:27,760
We had moments onstage
that no one will ever fucking know.

1720
02:01:29,480 --> 02:01:31,760
You lay off those drugs, Robby.

1721
02:01:33,160 --> 02:01:35,000
Hey, Merry Christmas.

1722
02:01:43,080 --> 02:01:45,640
We'll get together again,
you know...

1723
02:01:45,680 --> 02:01:47,760
in some strange way.

1724
02:01:47,840 --> 02:01:50,960
Maybe we'll make a movie together.
Black and white.

1725
02:01:59,760 --> 02:02:02,440
Sabrina, this is for you.

1726
02:02:06,760 --> 02:02:10,320
- Morrison, see you around.
- What, no bon voyage?

1727
02:02:10,360 --> 02:02:12,400
I'll see you back.

1728
02:02:13,880 --> 02:02:16,480
And little Princess Smiling Face...

1729
02:02:16,520 --> 02:02:19,600
this one's for you...

1730
02:02:19,680 --> 02:02:22,000
from Chief Mojo Rising.

1731
02:02:24,560 --> 02:02:25,840
Happy birthday, Princess.

1732
02:02:25,880 --> 02:02:29,160
- Let me see.
- It's you.

1733
02:02:29,240 --> 02:02:31,120
Forever young.

1734
02:02:32,640 --> 02:02:36,200
The strangest life
I've ever known.

1735
02:03:20,360 --> 02:03:22,680
Jim. You got a plane to catch, man?

1736
02:03:27,080 --> 02:03:29,320
Yeah.

1737
02:03:29,400 --> 02:03:32,120
We're reaching for death
on the end of a candle.

1738
02:03:32,200 --> 02:03:35,360
We're trying for something
that's already found us.

1739
02:03:35,400 --> 02:03:37,280
Last words.

1740
02:03:37,320 --> 02:03:39,600
Out.

1741
02:03:46,680 --> 02:03:48,240
Did you get all that?

1742
02:03:49,720 --> 02:03:50,800
Yeah.

1743
02:03:50,840 --> 02:03:52,720
I got it, Jim.

1744
02:04:01,840 --> 02:04:04,560
Come on. Let's get some tacos.

1745
02:04:22,160 --> 02:04:23,560
Death.

1746
02:04:25,520 --> 02:04:27,600
It's not so bad.

1747
02:04:27,640 --> 02:04:29,760
- Jim?
- I love my girl.

1748
02:04:29,840 --> 02:04:32,080
Jim, is that you?

1749
02:05:12,040 --> 02:05:16,240
I knew it was you, Jim Morrison.
I always know when it's you.

1750
02:05:27,120 --> 02:05:29,360
Come on, baby.
Get out of the tub.

1751
02:05:29,440 --> 02:05:31,960
Come on. Mama will dry you off.

1752
02:05:32,040 --> 02:05:35,400
Just stop joking around, you hear me?
Just cut it out.

1753
02:06:05,280 --> 02:06:07,560
Was it all right, Jim?

1754
02:06:10,200 --> 02:06:12,840
Did you enjoy it when it came...

1755
02:06:14,800 --> 02:06:17,160
just like you said you would?

1756
02:06:43,760 --> 02:06:46,000
They are waiting to take us...

1757
02:06:46,080 --> 02:06:48,240
into the severed garden.

1758
02:06:48,320 --> 02:06:51,200
You know how pale and wanton
thrillful comes death...

1759
02:06:51,280 --> 02:06:53,200
in the strange hour...

1760
02:06:53,280 --> 02:06:55,960
unannounced, unplanned for...

1761
02:06:56,040 --> 02:07:00,440
like a scary, over-friendly guest
you've brought to bed.

1762
02:07:00,520 --> 02:07:03,640
Death makes angels of us all
and give us wings...

1763
02:07:03,720 --> 02:07:07,240
where we had shoulders
smooth as ravens' claws.

1764
02:07:11,920 --> 02:07:14,200
No more money, no more fancy dress.

1765
02:07:14,280 --> 02:07:16,960
This other kingdom seems
by far the best...

1766
02:07:17,040 --> 02:07:20,080
until its other jaw
reveals incest...

1767
02:07:20,120 --> 02:07:23,120
and loose obedience
to a vegetable law.

1768
02:07:23,160 --> 02:07:26,480
I will not go.

1769
02:07:26,560 --> 02:07:29,800
I prefer a feast of friends
to the giant family.
