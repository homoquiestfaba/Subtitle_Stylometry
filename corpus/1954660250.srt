00:00:08,225 --> 00:00:11,504
And the ghostly winds whispered
but one sound upon my tortured ears:</i>

3
00:00:11,539 --> 00:00:14,165
<i>Morella... evermore</i>
Edgar Allan Poe

4
00:00:41,165 --> 00:00:48,985
Morella Locke! You have been found guilty of
witchcraft, blasphemy and murder.

5
00:00:51,336 --> 00:00:56,265
You have been ordered by this tribunal
to be sentenced to death -

6
00:00:56,515 --> 00:00:59,196
as proscribed by law.

7
00:01:03,996 --> 00:01:06,576
Do you have anything to say before this assembly?

8
00:01:08,395 --> 00:01:10,296
Gideon Locke!

9
00:01:13,006 --> 00:01:16,336
Yes, my husband, I speak to you!

10
00:01:16,635 --> 00:01:20,566
Mark well our daughter, I shall
live on within her!

11
00:01:23,476 --> 00:01:26,256
One day she and I will
live as one!

12
00:01:28,407 --> 00:01:32,367
To welcome you to the
gates of hell!

13
00:01:33,106 --> 00:01:38,095
Look into her eyes!
She has the power to control men's minds.

14
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:43,085
This is barbaric! No one has been executed
for witchcraft in the county for 40 years!

15
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:46,556
The laws governing such matters 
are still on our books!
 
16
00:01:46,591 --> 00:01:50,153
Do you suggest we set her free?

17
00:01:50,188 --> 00:01:53,716
No. She will be hanged as
a murderess, nothing more.

18
00:01:55,016 --> 00:01:57,627
Your compassion is admirable, dr Gault. 

19
00:01:57,662 --> 00:02:00,237
Though the law is outside
your providence.

20
00:02:00,727 --> 00:02:05,047
She has lived as a witch! And she
shall die as a witch!

21
00:02:06,047 --> 00:02:07,807
Proceed!

22
00:02:14,777 --> 00:02:17,577
Now shall her eyes be put out.

23
00:02:18,457 --> 00:02:23,517
So even after her death she may cast no more evil spells.

24
00:03:01,238 --> 00:03:03,683
She shall stay there for
a fortnight.

25
00:03:03,718 --> 00:03:09,048
A warning to all who will
follow in her wicked ways!

26
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:37,358
Come, Gideon.

27
00:03:39,179 --> 00:03:45,049
No. Do not torment yourself
further, my friend.

28
00:03:45,688 --> 00:03:48,259
I will take care of interring
her remains.

29
00:03:48,669 --> 00:03:49,688
No!

30
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:55,079
No. I shall build a tomb on
the very spot where she died.

31
00:03:55,919 --> 00:04:00,079
May Morella live in peace.
For eternity.

32
00:04:01,659 --> 00:04:07,919
Edgar Allan Poe's
The Haunting of Morella

33
00:05:45,391 --> 00:05:48,711
Seventeen years later

34
00:06:45,752 --> 00:06:49,037
- Yes Sir?
- I have an appointment with Gideon Locke.

35
00:06:49,072 --> 00:06:52,972
Yes, you're expected.
If you follow me please,
Mr Chapman.

36
00:07:21,062 --> 00:07:23,123
Forgive me Sir, I...

37
00:07:23,563 --> 00:07:27,083
... sometimes forget my appearance.

38
00:07:28,413 --> 00:07:31,163
It's an honour fo finally
meet you, Sir!

39
00:07:32,503 --> 00:07:38,043
Your message stated that you have
an important transaction with me?

40
00:07:38,403 --> 00:07:41,753
Actually, Sir, this concerns
your daughter Lenora.

41
00:07:43,473 --> 00:07:45,163
I see.

42
00:07:45,413 --> 00:07:48,944
As you probably know, a trust fund was
set up by your late wife's family -

43 
00:07:48,979 --> 00:07:50,778
- prior to the birth of your daughter.

44
00:07:50,813 --> 00:07:55,814
According to the specifications set down,
Lenora is to come into that inheritance
on her 18th birthday.

45
00:07:56,174 --> 00:07:59,023
I understand the event will
take place in three days.

46
00:07:59,684 --> 00:08:03,248
Yes, on the 24th.

47
00:08:03,283 --> 00:08:06,148
I have some papers that require
her signature at that time.

48
00:08:06,183 --> 00:08:09,324
I'd like Lenora to look them
over beforehand.

49
00:08:09,963 --> 00:08:12,734
May I ask your age, Mr Chapman?

50
00:08:12,769 --> 00:08:15,161
My age? 27.

51
00:08:15,196 --> 00:08:17,554
Now, if I may see Lenora?

52
00:08:17,964 --> 00:08:20,544
I'm sorry, I absolutely
forbid it.

53
00:08:20,764 --> 00:08:25,464
- But Sir, I...
- Young man, you will leave this
house immediately!

54
00:08:25,499 --> 00:08:30,165
All further transactions will
be conducted by letter.
Is that understood?

55
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,694
Sir, if I have offended you
in any way...

56
00:08:34,155 --> 00:08:37,429
- Quintis!
- Yes?

57
00:08:37,464 --> 00:08:42,555
This young man is leaving now.
You will see him out.

58
00:08:42,974 --> 00:08:44,354
Yes, Sir.

59
00:08:44,684 --> 00:08:50,605
I have left the papers requiring
Lenora's signature on the table.
Good day, Sir!

60
00:08:54,255 --> 00:08:56,034
The portrait!

61
00:08:57,055 --> 00:08:58,420
Lenora?

62
00:08:58,455 --> 00:09:02,345
No, Sir. Mr Locke's late wife.

63
00:09:02,585 --> 00:09:04,164
Morella.

64
00:09:19,075 --> 00:09:21,445
He's a handsome young man!

65
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,225
Yes.

66
00:09:24,365 --> 00:09:26,185
I wonder what he wanted?

67
00:09:27,255 --> 00:09:29,465
You can daydream about him later.

68
00:09:29,845 --> 00:09:33,935
Come. Let us get back to our
lessons on Spain.


69
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:35,946
Uh, geography.

70
00:09:36,586 --> 00:09:41,205
What's the point of learning about the world
when I'm never allowed to leave these grounds?

71
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:45,127
Some day you may travel and see
all the places we read about.

72
00:09:45,162 --> 00:09:49,016
Some day? Not if father
has any say in things!

73
00:09:49,655 --> 00:09:54,946
If you make faces like that, no
young man will ever come to call!

74
00:09:55,946 --> 00:09:57,186
Here.

75
00:10:03,616 --> 00:10:06,056
I was saving this for your birthday.

76
00:10:06,091 --> 00:10:08,496
But you can have it now for a smile!

77
00:10:08,531 --> 00:10:10,786
For me! What is it?

78
00:10:11,966 --> 00:10:14,036
You'll have to open it to find out.

79
00:10:19,536 --> 00:10:23,476
It's beautiful!
Thank you, Miss Deveraux!

80
00:10:34,716 --> 00:10:36,466
How does it look?

81
00:10:37,947 --> 00:10:39,536
Lovely.

82
00:11:03,937 --> 00:11:06,687
King's knight takes bishop.

83
00:11:07,997 --> 00:11:12,627
I must confess, Gideon, your powers of
concentration never cease to amaze me!

84
00:11:12,662 --> 00:11:17,167
- It's as if you could still see!
- Yes, it is my curse!

85
00:11:17,627 --> 00:11:21,177
- Your laudeanum, Mr Locke! 
- Laudeanum?

86
00:11:21,407 --> 00:11:24,597
Yes, Mr Locke's having
difficulties sleeping.

87
00:11:25,557 --> 00:11:26,938
I see.

88
00:11:27,218 --> 00:11:31,348
Now, if you have no further need for
me tonight I'll be in my room, Mr Locke.

89
00:11:31,383 --> 00:11:34,127
- Good night.
- Doctor.

90
00:11:46,748 --> 00:11:50,488
Time for all proper young ladies
to be in their beds. Lenora?
 
91
00:11:50,523 --> 00:11:52,663
Can't I practice a little longer?

92
00:11:52,698 --> 00:11:57,728
You've practiced enough for one evening. Say goodnight
to your father and doctor Gault.

93
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:09,029
Good night, father. I hope you enjoyed my
playing, it was a piece I composed 
especially for you!

94
00:12:09,064 --> 00:12:12,108
It was beautiful!
Good night, my dear.

95
00:12:13,109 --> 00:12:16,288
- Dr Gault.
- Sleep well, Lenora.

96
00:12:21,209 --> 00:12:25,419
- By your leave.
- Miss Deveraux.

97
00:12:31,939 --> 00:12:35,659
I must say, Miss Deveraux has
become an accomplished woman.

98
00:12:35,939 --> 00:12:39,579
Yes, she's more than a governess
to Lenora.

99
00:12:39,614 --> 00:12:43,219
Over the years I have grown
quite dependent upon her.

100
00:12:44,179 --> 00:12:47,519
In some strange ways she
reminds me of... 

101
00:12:48,449 --> 00:12:50,389
Morella?

102
00:12:53,409 --> 00:12:59,819
After all these years I still can not
bring myself to utter that name.

103
00:13:23,878 --> 00:13:26,039
<i>June 14.</i>

104
00:13:26,254 --> 00:13:30,741
<i>While visiting Northampton I have encountered
the most extraordinary woman.</ I></i>

105
00:13:31,338 --> 00:13:34,003
<i>Her name is Morella Winthrop.</i>

106
00:13:34,038 --> 00:13:36,517
<i>I know nothing of her
family or background.</i>

107
00:13:36,552 --> 00:13:40,336
<i>Yet I feel an immediate rapport with her. </i>

108
00:13:45,841 --> 00:13:48,087
<i>November 21.</i>

109
00:13:48,122 --> 00:13:53,929
<i>My new bride Morella has recently become fascinated
with certain mystical writings</i>-

110
00:13:53,964 --> 00:13:59,779
-<i>centering on life after death.
Indeed she has a developed a morbid preoccupation with death.</i>

111
00:13:59,814 --> 00:14:03,339
<i>Possibly due to her own increasing ill health.</i>

112
00:14:04,076 --> 00:14:11,467
<i>I can not look into her eyes without
the sensation of plummeting into some
dreary and unfathomable abyss.</i>

113
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:18,930
<i>September 24. Morella has
almost died during childbirth.</i>

114
00:14:19,341 --> 00:14:25,721
<i>Our newborn daughter Lenora appears
healthy in all respects and has the same
dark eyes as her mother.</i>

115
00:14:26,761 --> 00:14:31,471
<i>Dr Gault has confided to me that Morella
may only have a few months more to live.</i>

116
00:14:35,121 --> 00:14:41,466
<i>While I was away on business Morella plunged
into her occult studies with a renewed passion.</i>

117
00:14:41,501 --> 00:14:47,811
<i>Accompanied by some unknown disciple,
she deciphered a ritual she believed will
grant immortality.</i>

118
00:14:51,251 --> 00:14:57,482
<i>The first step necessitated the slaughter
of a serving girl from our household.</i>

119
00:16:22,153 --> 00:16:26,448
<i>Morella bled her in order to
bathe in virgin blood.</i>

120
00:16:26,483 --> 00:16:30,004
<i>Thus was she prepared to invoke
the powers of darkness.</i>

121
00:16:49,444 --> 00:16:54,294
<i>The final act of this ghastly
initiation took place at a graveyard.</i>

122
00:16:54,329 --> 00:16:59,143
<i>Fortunately I arrived home sooner than
expected and discovered the slain
body of the serving girl.</i>

123
00:16:59,553 --> 00:17:02,704
<i>With several townspeople I
set out to find Morella.</i>

124
00:17:03,573 --> 00:17:08,294
<i>We arrived moments before she
could conclude the horrible ceremony.</i>

125
00:17:08,329 --> 00:17:12,364
<i>Justice was swift and severe.</i>

126
00:17:14,124 --> 00:17:17,084
<i>May God have mercy on us all!</i>

127
00:18:16,956 --> 00:18:18,795
I didn't hear you come in.

128
00:18:20,105 --> 00:18:23,455
In this household one
learns to walk quietly!

129
00:18:25,206 --> 00:18:27,245
Mmm, it feels good!

130
00:18:27,645 --> 00:18:31,335
You've had a tiring day.
Perhaps some wine?

131
00:18:42,346 --> 00:18:44,936
No, not now.

132
00:18:45,706 --> 00:18:47,325
What's wrong?

133
00:18:51,736 --> 00:18:56,706
Nothing's wrong. I just prefer
to be alone tonight, that's all.

134
00:19:07,017 --> 00:19:10,707
You know I have to prepare
Lenora's lessons for the week.

135
00:19:12,976 --> 00:19:14,817
I understand.

136
00:19:22,117 --> 00:19:23,737
And tomorrow night?

137
00:19:24,156 --> 00:19:28,376
There's not a living soul I'd rather
spend the evening with than you!

138
00:20:35,448 --> 00:20:37,478
Arise, my love!

139
00:20:39,328 --> 00:20:42,327
Arise from your slumber, my love!

140
00:20:43,618 --> 00:20:50,588
The autumnal equinox is here. And a
fresh young body awaits you.

141
00:20:51,246 --> 00:20:54,094
Now Morella -

142
00:20:54,936 --> 00:20:57,558
- come forth!

143
00:20:58,125 --> 00:21:00,308
Come forth!

144
00:21:21,339 --> 00:21:23,439
<i>Lenora.</i>

145
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:28,308
Miss Deveraux?

146
00:21:29,319 --> 00:21:32,749
<i>Come to me, Lenora!</i>

147
00:23:45,021 --> 00:23:47,112
What are you doing up at this hour?

148
00:23:49,671 --> 00:23:54,151
Father, what happened?
How did I get here?

149
00:23:55,452 --> 00:23:57,711
What do you mean?
You don't remember?

150
00:23:59,212 --> 00:24:03,372
Well, I was dreaming, and I heard
somebody calling my name from far away!

151
00:24:04,392 --> 00:24:06,022
I followed the voice...

152
00:24:09,071 --> 00:24:10,362
It was her.

153
00:24:13,582 --> 00:24:15,792
Was I walking in my sleep?

154
00:24:17,002 --> 00:24:20,212
Yes, yes, that must be it.

155
00:24:21,062 --> 00:24:23,832
I guess I was just upset
from reading your diary.

156
00:24:23,867 --> 00:24:27,242
My diary? Where did
you find my diary?

157
00:24:27,572 --> 00:24:31,252
In my room where you left it!
- I did no such thing!

158
00:24:33,403 --> 00:24:37,003
Someone in this house
must have taken it.

159
00:24:37,952 --> 00:24:40,458
Why didn't you tell
me about her before?

160
00:24:40,493 --> 00:24:45,773
I would have understood!
- The hour is late. We will
discuss it in the morning.

161
00:25:04,603 --> 00:25:09,173
What are these?
- Legal documents concerning your inheritance.

162
00:25:09,583 --> 00:25:13,063
A lawyer brought them for
your signature.

163
00:25:13,953 --> 00:25:16,068
This language is quite confusing.

164
00:25:16,103 --> 00:25:19,064
If it weren't, we'd have
no need for lawyers.

165
00:25:19,463 --> 00:25:23,164
Perhaps I can visit the village and
have him explain this to me?

166
00:25:23,394 --> 00:25:28,513
That won't be necessary. Dr Gault read them
to me and they are completly in order.

167
00:25:29,293 --> 00:25:35,344
Father, I am almost 18 years old. Don't you think
it is time I started making decisions for myself?

168
00:25:36,253 --> 00:25:42,204
Lenora, you must realize by now
why we never visit the village.

169
00:25:44,473 --> 00:25:49,374
There is still great resentment
there towards our family.

170
00:25:50,284 --> 00:25:53,454
Because of mother? That
was 17 years ago!

171
00:25:53,754 --> 00:25:55,574
You will do as you are told!

172
00:25:57,954 --> 00:26:01,604
Besides, we have everything
we need here.

173
00:26:02,441 --> 00:26:04,287
Well, maybe you have.

174
00:26:04,322 --> 00:26:09,381
In two days I will be financially independent.
I can travel whereever I want then.

175
00:26:09,424 --> 00:26:14,244
- How dare you speak to me that way?
- Well, maybe it's time I started!

176
00:26:48,605 --> 00:26:49,825
Mr Chapman?

177
00:26:50,845 --> 00:26:52,765
Yes? How can I help you?

178
00:26:55,135 --> 00:26:58,945
I'm Coel Deveraux and employed as
governess in the Locke household.

179
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:01,965
Pleasure to meet, you, Miss Deveraux.
Please be seated.

180
00:27:04,795 --> 00:27:08,645
I understand you drew up the documents
involving Lenora Locke's inheritance?

181
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:10,616
Actually, my father did.

182
00:27:11,085 --> 00:27:12,400
Indeed! 

183
00:27:12,435 --> 00:27:17,556
Then Lenora has a number of questions. Some
of the legal terms are rather complicated.

184
00:27:17,591 --> 00:27:21,055
You may tell Miss Locke I'm
available at her convenience.

185
00:27:21,366 --> 00:27:24,480
Then Lenora would like you
to call on her this afternoon.

186
00:27:24,515 --> 00:27:28,225
I'm afraid Mr Locke made it quite clear
my visits were not welcome.

187
00:27:28,635 --> 00:27:32,000
Mr Chapman, you must understand Gideon Locke
has not been a rational man -

188
00:27:32,035 --> 00:27:37,666
- since the tragic death of his wife.
He still treats Lenora as if she were a child.

189
00:27:38,806 --> 00:27:42,106
Lenora suggests a meeting away
from the mansion grounds.

190
00:27:42,766 --> 00:27:45,631
I see. Where would such
a meeting take place?

191
00:27:45,666 --> 00:27:50,336
I'll be giving Lenora her lessons near the lake.
At the northeast edge of our property.

192
00:27:50,371 --> 00:27:52,966
You may find us there this afternoon.

193
00:27:53,806 --> 00:27:55,436
Now I must go.

194
00:27:58,436 --> 00:28:00,826
Until this afternoon, Mr Chapman.

195
00:28:35,077 --> 00:28:38,427
Mr Chapman! I'm pleased
that you could join us.

196
00:28:39,457 --> 00:28:41,727
Allow me to introduce
Miss Lenora Locke.

197
00:28:43,507 --> 00:28:47,097
- It's a pleasure to meet you, Miss Locke.
- Thank you!

198
00:28:49,117 --> 00:28:53,648
I think we have studied enough Latin for one day.
I know you and Mr Chapman have much to talk about.

199
00:28:55,037 --> 00:28:56,257
Yes.

200
00:28:58,987 --> 00:29:03,707
It's a beautiful day. You two should
take a walk while you discuss your legal matters.

201
00:29:04,727 --> 00:29:08,668
There's a lovely path that
winds along the brook there.

202
00:29:08,703 --> 00:29:09,798
You won't be coming with us?

203
00:29:10,658 --> 00:29:13,208
No thank you. I'll just stay
here if you don't mind.

204
00:29:15,287 --> 00:29:19,517
- Would you care to go for a walk, Miss Locke?
- I'd love to.

205
00:29:34,330 --> 00:29:40,019
So you see, the summation of all that legal
wording is that you become a rather well-to-do
young lady, Miss Locke.

206
00:29:41,094 --> 00:29:44,827
Have you made any immediate plans?
- Yes, I'd love to travel.

207
00:29:44,862 --> 00:29:48,525
I'd like to actually visit the
places I've only read about.

208
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:53,777
I'd love to see the world myself some day. I've only
gone as far as Cambridge and that was to study.

209
00:29:54,442 --> 00:29:57,080
- Did you get to visit Boston?
- Not very often.

210
00:29:57,115 --> 00:30:02,449
I spent most of my time buried in law books. See,
I've lived a rather sheltered life myself.

211
00:30:02,844 --> 00:30:06,940
At least you live in town!
Tell me, what is it like?

212
00:30:07,624 --> 00:30:12,692
Somehow, it seems smaller than when I was young.
Maybe it's just that I've gotten taller.

213
00:30:13,392 --> 00:30:15,935
Other than that, things are
pretty much the same.

214
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:19,033
- Are there many people my age?
- Yes, quite a few!

215
00:30:21,278 --> 00:30:25,995
- What about the young ladies? Are they pretty?
- Some are.

216
00:30:26,771 --> 00:30:28,330
None as lovely as you.

217
00:30:44,441 --> 00:30:48,711
We've wandered off the estate. I've
never been this far before!

218
00:30:48,933 --> 00:30:52,149
Don't worry, I know where we are.
This is the old cemetary.

219
00:30:53,243 --> 00:30:56,379
The servants used to tell
ghost stories about this place.

220
00:30:57,048 --> 00:31:01,022
I came here when I was 10 years old. I got
so scared, I ran all the way back home!

221
00:31:02,081 --> 00:31:07,154
Somehow it doesn't frighten me. Just
seems lonely and neglected.

222
00:31:08,324 --> 00:31:10,275
I should get you back
to Miss Deveraux.

223
00:31:11,845 --> 00:31:15,231
I can't tell you what it's like
not having somebody like you to talk to.

224
00:31:17,192 --> 00:31:21,500
- I wish this day could go on forever!
- It never end.

225
00:31:34,329 --> 00:31:37,476
Forgive me! I don't know what came over me.

226
00:31:38,359 --> 00:31:40,517
You needn't aplogize, Lenora.

227
00:31:41,764 --> 00:31:43,417
Come, I'll take you back.

228
00:31:43,985 --> 00:31:48,610
No, I'll find my way. Besides, I'd like
to be here alone for a while.

229
00:31:49,478 --> 00:31:50,745
You'll be alright?

230
00:31:51,747 --> 00:31:53,766
I'll be fine.

231
00:31:59,378 --> 00:32:03,588
- May I call on you again tomorrow?
- By the lake.

232
00:32:04,976 --> 00:32:07,356
By the lake, Miss Locke.

233
00:34:29,442 --> 00:34:34,618
Don't look away, Lenora!
See what your father and
others have done to her?

234
00:34:35,031 --> 00:34:36,744
Let me go, I wanna leave here!

235
00:34:36,779 --> 00:34:41,248
She gave you life. And now you
will share your life with her!

236
00:34:41,949 --> 00:34:49,046
Can't you feel it, Lenora? Her blood in
your veins, her soul in your body!

237
00:34:49,081 --> 00:34:53,165
- Her thoughts in your mind!
- I don't know what your talking
about, let me go! 

238
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:58,604
Look at her, Lenora! Look into
those dark empty eyes.

239
00:35:05,873 --> 00:35:08,610
Welcome back, Morella!

240
00:35:10,109 --> 00:35:11,952
How long has it been?

241
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:14,914
17 years.

242
00:35:17,671 --> 00:35:20,997
- And this is Lenora's body?
- Yes.

243
00:35:23,112 --> 00:35:27,094
I can feel her. She struggles
within me.

244
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:31,435
Do not worry. Lenora's
will is weak.

245
00:35:32,281 --> 00:35:35,771
Eventually you shall
be in full control.

246
00:35:43,122 --> 00:35:48,189
You have done very well, my love.
Your reward is long overdue.

247
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:55,586
Yes, as you promised, we shall perform
the rites of immortality together.

248
00:35:56,178 --> 00:35:59,218
And I shall serve you for eternity!

249
00:36:01,503 --> 00:36:03,039
Morella?

250
00:36:04,284 --> 00:36:09,539
I fear that we have underestimated
her. Lenora is strong!

251
00:36:13,592 --> 00:36:16,715
I shall not be able to hold on
to her much longer.

252
00:36:17,822 --> 00:36:19,506
Will you be able to return?

253
00:36:19,921 --> 00:36:24,327
In minute periods. But I can
not remain within her.

254
00:36:24,885 --> 00:36:28,605
We must find a permanent dwelling
place for my spirit.

255
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,01
Where?

256
00:36:32,684 --> 00:36:34,538
My remains.

257
00:36:36,364 --> 00:36:38,454
You must resurrect them!

258
00:36:54,350 --> 00:36:55,868
Miss Deveraux?

259
00:36:56,553 --> 00:37:00,454
Lie still, Lenora.
You need to rest.

260
00:37:00,890 --> 00:37:02,546
What happened?

261
00:37:02,581 --> 00:37:08,206
I found you by the entrace to the old cemetary.
Apparently you had a fainting spell.

262
00:37:08,482 --> 00:37:10,121
Don't you remember?

263
00:37:10,828 --> 00:37:12,351
No.

264
00:37:13,146 --> 00:37:17,390
I suppose the shock of seeing your
mother's resting place caused you
to lose consciousness.

265
00:37:18,639 --> 00:37:20,372
Now you're tired.

266
00:37:21,153 --> 00:37:23,541
Everything will be better in the morning.

267
00:37:26,937 --> 00:37:28,968
You're not leaving?

268
00:37:30,132 --> 00:37:31,574
You need your sleep.

269
00:37:33,528 --> 00:37:36,216
And I have many more
things to attend to.

270
00:37:44,958 --> 00:37:47,299
Pleasant dreams, Lenora!

271
00:38:16,858 --> 00:38:19,321
I love you so much, Ilsa!

272
00:38:30,217 --> 00:38:34,331
Mother told me never to believe what
a man says with his pants off!

273
00:38:35,472 --> 00:38:39,913
But it's true! I'll prove it!
Come.

274
00:38:40,223 --> 00:38:45,992
Miles, you devil! We have the rest of our
lives for such things! After we're married.

275
00:38:46,285 --> 00:38:49,252
I can't afford to take a wife until
I finish my apprenticeship, you know that.

276
00:38:49,287 --> 00:38:51,928
This is difficult for me too, Miles.

277
00:38:51,963 --> 00:38:55,836
But it's late and I have to return to
my quarters before I'm missed.

278
00:38:55,871 --> 00:38:58,441
You won't have to work as a
servant girl for long.

279
00:38:58,788 --> 00:39:02,629
- Here again tomorrow?
- Yes.

280
00:39:04,044 --> 00:39:06,041
Now I must go.

281
00:39:10,168 --> 00:39:12,420
Good night, my love!

282
00:39:24,270 --> 00:39:26,300
<i>Help!</i>

283
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:30,487
Hello?

284
00:39:31,142 --> 00:39:33,546
<i>Help!</i>

285
00:39:41,035 --> 00:39:43,232
<i>Help!</i>

286
00:39:53,982 --> 00:39:56,118
Is someone there?

287
00:39:57,799 --> 00:39:58,759
<i>Help me!</i>

288
00:40:15,182 --> 00:40:17,736
<i>Help!</i>

289
00:40:23,901 --> 00:40:24,860
<i>Help.</i>

290
00:40:43,576 --> 00:40:46,092
<i>Help!</i>

291
00:40:51,702 --> 00:40:53,612
Where are you?

292
00:40:54,950 --> 00:40:58,013
<i>In here.</i>

293
00:41:35,814 --> 00:41:38,478
Miss Deveraux, why ...

294
00:43:06,035 --> 00:43:08,112
Morella!

295
00:43:09,228 --> 00:43:10,907
I still live!

296
00:43:36,015 --> 00:43:37,322
Good day, Mr Chapman.

297
00:43:37,357 --> 00:43:40,074
Dr Gault. I hear the Ashtons
had a blessed event.

298
00:43:40,109 --> 00:43:44,505
Yes, twins. Unfortunately my
fee is not doubled in such cases.
 
299
00:43:45,115 --> 00:43:47,603
- Are you locking up early?
- Yes.

300
00:43:48,194 --> 00:43:52,700
When a young man whose enterprising closes
his business at this hour there can be
only one of two reasons.

301
00:43:52,735 --> 00:43:57,207
- He's either ill or he's in love.
- I've never felt better in my life.

302
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:02,506
Guy, would it be discrete to reveal
the young lady's name?

303
00:44:03,336 --> 00:44:05,467
Discrete? Yes.

304
00:44:05,865 --> 00:44:09,177
Wise? Perhaps not under
the circumstances.

305
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:14,486
Guy, I have known Lenora
Locke all of her life.

306
00:44:14,521 --> 00:44:16,927
I have known Gideon for most of mine.

307
00:44:16,962 --> 00:44:18,692
They are both fine people.

308
00:44:19,530 --> 00:44:24,567
But there is something
unhealthy in that house.

309
00:44:25,195 --> 00:44:26,884
Do use caution, my boy.

310
00:44:27,258 --> 00:44:31,522
I'm afraid this is one time I won't
follow my physician's advice.

311
00:44:36,539 --> 00:44:41,271
- Good day, Dr Gault.
- Good day to you, you young rogue!

312
00:44:48,205 --> 00:44:51,794
- You're very quiet today!
- Am I?

313
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:55,364
Yesterday we talked about
everything under the sun.

314
00:44:55,953 --> 00:44:58,653
It was almost as if we'd known
each other all our lives!

315
00:44:58,688 --> 00:45:03,943
- Today you've barely said a word.
- Well, maybe we've said all there is to say?

316
00:45:05,141 --> 00:45:08,877
I don't think so. Lenora,
is something wrong?

317
00:45:09,384 --> 00:45:10,784
I'm not sure.

318
00:45:11,498 --> 00:45:17,456
Have you ever said or done something and
then you felt as if it weren't you doing it?

319
00:45:18,106 --> 00:45:21,297
- I don't understand.
- No, neither do I.

320
00:45:22,056 --> 00:45:25,164
Last night I discovered
my mother's crypt.

321
00:45:27,084 --> 00:45:31,934
And then it was like somebody else
was speaking and acting for me.

322
00:45:32,493 --> 00:45:35,562
I don't remember everything that happened.
It was almost like a dream.

323
00:45:35,597 --> 00:45:37,556
Maybe that's all it was?

324
00:45:38,006 --> 00:45:42,426
Now, that's what Miss Deveraux said.
Yet I still can't help but feeling -

325
00:45:42,461 --> 00:45:44,830
- that there's someone inside of me.
 
326
00:45:44,865 --> 00:45:48,928
- Someone waiting for me to let go!
- Lenora, you've had a bad dream.

327
00:45:48,963 --> 00:45:51,857
You're upset by it, there's nothing
uncommon about that!

328
00:45:52,527 --> 00:45:54,284
You're right.

329
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:57,209
See Guy, I just don't want to 
believe that I'm ...

330
00:46:01,209 --> 00:46:03,800
Come on, I know of a place!

331
00:46:13,321 --> 00:46:16,515
- Who lives here?
- No one. It's been deserted for years.

332
00:46:16,550 --> 00:46:21,114
Someone's been here recently. I'd say this
has become quite a popular meeting place.

333
00:46:21,574 --> 00:46:27,395
Well, it used to be the quarters of our caretaker.
I remember he was terribly young and handsome.

334
00:46:28,349 --> 00:46:32,042
Then father let him go. 
I never understood why.

335
00:46:32,077 --> 00:46:34,418
I'll see if I can start a fire.

336
00:46:58,335 --> 00:47:01,512
- Guy!
- Yes?

337
00:47:03,086 --> 00:47:06,580
I hope you weren't paying much
attention to what I said earlier. 

338
00:47:06,615 --> 00:47:08,320
About the caretaker?

339
00:47:08,355 --> 00:47:12,928
No. All that nonsense about
another person.

340
00:47:12,963 --> 00:47:17,869
- Sometimes my imagination gets carried away.
- That's not uncommon.

341
00:47:18,074 --> 00:47:24,261
Sometimes I imagine what it would feel like
having your hands touching my body.

342
00:47:25,273 --> 00:47:27,275
Lenora, perhaps we ...

343
00:47:33,878 --> 00:47:37,520
I wanna feel what it's like
having you inside me.

344
00:49:18,477 --> 00:49:20,117
Excuse me, Sir.

345
00:49:20,849 --> 00:49:26,556
- Miles Archer wishes to speak with you.
- I know no one of that name?

346
00:49:26,931 --> 00:49:30,787
A young blacksmith from the village.
He's very insistent.

347
00:49:31,052 --> 00:49:32,619
Very well.

348
00:49:40,073 --> 00:49:44,975
- Mr Locke?
- I am Gideon Locke. How may I help you?

349
00:49:45,486 --> 00:49:48,425
Well, this concerns a young woman
on your household staff, Sir.

350
00:49:49,299 --> 00:49:51,953
What is it, you wish to marry her?

351
00:49:52,655 --> 00:49:57,367
Well, yes Sir, but you misunderstand me.
I am concerned about her whereabouts.

352
00:49:57,402 --> 00:50:00,529
Word has reached me that she
did not return here last night.

353
00:50:00,854 --> 00:50:04,825
You say she's employed
in my household?

354
00:50:05,386 --> 00:50:08,835
Yes, Sir, her name is Ilsa Carrell.
She's your servant girl.

355
00:50:09,262 --> 00:50:13,213
May I have your permission to search
the grounds? She might be hurt somewhere.

356
00:50:17,082 --> 00:50:18,237
Sir?

357
00:50:20,060 --> 00:50:21,072
I ...

358
00:50:21,477 --> 00:50:24,351
I beg your pardon, Sir.

359
00:50:24,722 --> 00:50:28,759
I, I sometimes fall into reveries. Yes,
yes of course you may search.

360
00:50:29,844 --> 00:50:34,660
Thank you. Sorry to disturb you.
Good day.

361
00:51:01,791 --> 00:51:04,617
I understood you were giving Miss
Lenora her lessons today?

362
00:51:04,652 --> 00:51:09,001
Yes. Who was that that just
left, Quintis?

363
00:51:09,036 --> 00:51:13,351
A young man from the village. I contacted
him when Ilsa didn't return to her quarters
last night.

364
00:51:14,592 --> 00:51:16,315
Servant girls have run away before.

365
00:51:16,350 --> 00:51:23,772
Yes, usually with their young men. She didn't
happen to mention anything about going anywhere?

366
00:51:24,458 --> 00:51:29,731
Why, no. The last time I spoke with
her she didn't say a word.

367
00:51:51,802 --> 00:51:53,850
What are you doing in my room?

368
00:51:54,394 --> 00:51:56,910
I followed you to the old graveyard.

369
00:51:58,656 --> 00:52:01,568
A few minutes later I saw Ilsa arrive.

370
00:52:01,603 --> 00:52:04,317
What were you two doing there together?

371
00:52:04,961 --> 00:52:07,524
I don't like your questions, Diane.

372
00:52:07,559 --> 00:52:11,493
And I especially don't
like being followed by anyone.

373
00:52:15,458 --> 00:52:17,713
I need to talk to you.

374
00:52:19,801 --> 00:52:21,326
Not here.

375
00:52:23,099 --> 00:52:24,475
Tonight.

376
00:52:24,867 --> 00:52:28,289
At the lake, at half past 10.

377
00:52:28,324 --> 00:52:30,770
I'll be there.

378
00:53:04,340 --> 00:53:05,531
Lenora?

379
00:53:07,346 --> 00:53:09,042
Yes, father dear?

380
00:53:09,531 --> 00:53:12,750
Where have you been?
It's very late.

381
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:16,373
And how does a blind man tell the time?

382
00:53:17,138 --> 00:53:19,872
By the chimes of the clock, you know that.

383
00:53:20,285 --> 00:53:23,373
I also know that you're a helpless man.

384
00:53:23,937 --> 00:53:26,400
Living in constant fear.

385
00:53:26,435 --> 00:53:30,752
- Lenora, you must understand ...
- Were you afraid that I'd become like her?

386
00:53:31,515 --> 00:53:36,135
Her madness, as you call it,
began when she married.

387
00:53:36,170 --> 00:53:39,543
Were you afraid that I'd be the
same as I became a woman?

388
00:53:39,578 --> 00:53:42,629
I did what I could to protect you.

389
00:53:42,664 --> 00:53:45,681
You were afraid that she
and I would be as one.

390
00:53:46,111 --> 00:53:47,936
My God!

391
00:53:49,611 --> 00:53:52,317
That voice ...

392
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:06,234
You sought to be rid of me but
I shall live within her.
Sleep well, Gideon.

393
00:54:10,286 --> 00:54:11,881
Morella.

394
00:54:37,042 --> 00:54:37,882
Lenora!

395
00:55:07,396 --> 00:55:08,940
Quintin!

396
00:55:12,937 --> 00:55:14,353
Yes, Miss Lenora?

397
00:55:14,388 --> 00:55:16,018
Quintin!

398
00:55:20,996 --> 00:55:23,143
Quintin, get me out of here!

399
00:55:26,236 --> 00:55:27,838
Quintin!

400
00:55:33,186 --> 00:55:39,934
Quintin, help me!
No, don't go, help me!

401
00:56:45,888 --> 00:56:47,762
Get out!

402
00:56:58,428 --> 00:57:03,391
Lenora Locke! You have been found guilty
of witchcraft and blasphemy!

403
00:57:03,659 --> 00:57:07,931
For these and other crimes you are
hereby sentenced to death.

404
00:57:07,966 --> 00:57:10,941
- As proscribed by law.
- No!

405
00:57:11,433 --> 00:57:13,129
No!

406
00:57:22,654 --> 00:57:24,357
Father!

407
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:28,437
Forgive me, I sometimes
forget my appearance.

408
00:57:35,080 --> 00:57:41,675
Lenora, darling! I was saving this for your
birthday. But you can have it now for a smile.

409
00:57:42,771 --> 00:57:44,493
What is it?

410
00:57:45,521 --> 00:57:48,231
You'll have to open it to find out.

411
00:58:02,586 --> 00:58:06,011
- Welcome to hell!
- No!

412
00:58:06,652 --> 00:58:07,731
No. No.

413
00:58:45,445 --> 00:58:47,453
Ilsa!

414
00:59:01,089 --> 00:59:03,621
Ilsa, wait!

415
00:59:24,478 --> 00:59:25,690
Ilsa?

416
00:59:42,427 --> 00:59:43,507
Come here!

417
01:00:23,536 --> 01:00:29,383
One more feeding, my love,
and you'll be fully resurrected!

418
01:03:12,159 --> 01:03:15,724
Quintis indicated that it
was urgent that I see you.

419
01:03:17,419 --> 01:03:22,277
I understand Miss Deveraux arranged a
meeting between yourself and Lenora?

420
01:03:22,312 --> 01:03:26,614
- Sir, I asure you ...
- You need not deny it for her sake, young man.

421
01:03:26,863 --> 01:03:29,675
I may be blind, but
others see for me.

422
01:03:30,536 --> 01:03:34,704
Very well, Sir. I wish to ask for
the hand of your daughter in marriage.

423
01:03:34,739 --> 01:03:36,849
Very honourable.

424
01:03:39,706 --> 01:03:43,410
Then you would be agreeable to taking her
out of this place immediately?

425
01:03:43,445 --> 01:03:48,078
- Yes, but a few days ago ...
- A few days ago I was concerned for her mind.

426
01:03:48,350 --> 01:03:51,335
Now I am concerned for her soul.

427
01:03:52,881 --> 01:03:55,569
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

428
01:03:57,274 --> 01:04:04,601
Morella was the most beautiful, the most
fascinating creature I had ever known.

429
01:04:05,550 --> 01:04:08,616
After we were married,
madness came.

430
01:04:09,061 --> 01:04:12,571
Household staff vanished
for no apparent reason.

431
01:04:12,606 --> 01:04:16,704
Eventually I discovered that she had
been performing human sacrifices.

432
01:04:18,431 --> 01:04:20,117
There was a trial.

433
01:04:20,569 --> 01:04:25,023
- And she was executed for witchcraft.
- I've heard stories when I was young.

434
01:04:25,058 --> 01:04:33,697
Before she died she swor she would
return. And in the body of Lenora.

435
01:04:34,336 --> 01:04:38,240
For 17 years I have lived in dread of that prophecy.

436
01:04:39,957 --> 01:04:42,288
Now it has come to pass.

437
01:04:43,974 --> 01:04:48,474
- But you don't seriously believe ...
- That Morella could rise from the dead?

438
01:04:48,509 --> 01:04:56,007
Last night Lenora spoke with me here in this room.
But it was Morella's words that came from those lips.

439
01:04:57,072 --> 01:05:07,381
Call me mad if you will. But my wife has
returned to take possession of my daughter.

440
01:05:09,459 --> 01:05:14,083
- Where is Lenora now?
- She left the house this morning and has not returned.

441
01:05:15,246 --> 01:05:18,933
Quintis is out looking for her but the
estate is large. She could be anywhere.

442
01:05:18,968 --> 01:05:21,624
- I'll find her.
- Yes.

443
01:05:21,659 --> 01:05:25,309
Yes, there is still a chance she could respond to you.

444
01:05:25,882 --> 01:05:31,473
Take her to the village. Find
Reverend Ward and Dr Gault.

445
01:05:32,039 --> 01:05:34,554
There may still be a way
of exercising Morella's spirit!

446
01:05:34,589 --> 01:05:37,638
- I'll speak to Dr Gault personally.
- Thank you.

447
01:05:37,673 --> 01:05:40,291
You're the only person I can call upon.

448
01:05:40,326 --> 01:05:43,451
Miss Deveraux and nurse
Summers have both disappeared.

449
01:05:43,486 --> 01:05:45,369
Disappeared?

450
01:05:52,509 --> 01:05:57,328
Just like those poor
others 17 years ago!

451
01:06:14,740 --> 01:06:18,882
- Lenora, are you alright?
- Is something wrong? Tell me!

452
01:06:18,917 --> 01:06:23,024
- I don't know. Have you seen Miss Deveraux?
- Why, I've been looking for her myself.

453
01:06:23,655 --> 01:06:26,899
- Both of you should leave the estate immediately!
- Guy, what's happened?

454
01:06:27,362 --> 01:06:31,286
This is difficult to say. I suspect
your father may be mentally deranged.

455
01:06:32,237 --> 01:06:35,763
- No, he's sometimes ...
- Lenora, he's raving about exorcism -

456
01:06:35,798 --> 01:06:39,252
- and your mother coming back from the dead.
I'm going to get Dr Gault.

457
01:06:39,519 --> 01:06:43,322
- Well, then I should be with him!
- No, I believe you'll be safer away from the house.

458
01:06:43,358 --> 01:06:46,209
At least until the doctor completes his examination.

459
01:06:46,705 --> 01:06:52,268
Alright. But let me find Miss Deveraux
first. We'll be waiting for you when you
return from the village.

460
01:06:52,690 --> 01:06:53,802
Where?

461
01:06:54,678 --> 01:06:57,397
By the old cemetary. It's on the way.

462
01:06:59,424 --> 01:07:00,867
Lenora!

463
01:08:11,426 --> 01:08:15,033
Now, there's every indication
that this is indeed Ilsa Carrell.

464
01:08:17,114 --> 01:08:19,113
Or what's left of her.

465
01:08:20,690 --> 01:08:24,098
A servant girl reported missing.
Who could have done such a thing?

466
01:08:24,534 --> 01:08:26,428
I don't know.

467
01:08:27,649 --> 01:08:31,701
It's this incision along
the jugular vein that worries me.

468
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,844
I have only seen one other case like this.

469
01:08:35,180 --> 01:08:36,623
Yes?

470
01:08:37,735 --> 01:08:42,600
I was about to say that was 17 years ago.

471
01:08:42,886 --> 01:08:47,300
Morella Locke used exactly that
procedure in one of her rituals.

472
01:08:48,336 --> 01:08:51,091
Doctor, you know Gideon Locke
rather well, don't you?

473
01:08:51,648 --> 01:08:53,811
As well as anyone, I imagine.

474
01:08:54,217 --> 01:08:58,153
Has he shown any signs recently
of mental deterioration?

475
01:08:58,624 --> 01:09:02,966
Gideon has been suffering from deep
depression ever since his wife died.

476
01:09:04,292 --> 01:09:08,522
But if you're questioning his sanity.
No, I wager he's as sane as you or I.

477
01:09:09,476 --> 01:09:12,066
Possibly could you go out to the Locke estate?

478
01:09:12,461 --> 01:09:14,995
- Yes, but I don't understand?
- There's no time to explain.

479
01:09:15,030 --> 01:09:17,530
If you care for your friend then hurry!

480
01:09:17,789 --> 01:09:19,844
But, Guy ...

481
01:09:20,853 --> 01:09:22,978
I'll get the carriage.

482
01:09:57,317 --> 01:09:59,021
Miss Deveraux?

483
01:10:29,346 --> 01:10:30,187
<i>Lenora!</i>

484
01:10:35,035 --> 01:10:35,874
<i>Lenora!</i>

485
01:10:39,410 --> 01:10:40,597
Yes!

486
01:10:41,596 --> 01:10:43,531
Yes, I'm coming.

487
01:11:03,990 --> 01:11:04,830
<i>Lenora!</i>

488
01:11:47,199 --> 01:11:50,090
<i>Come, Lenora!</i>

489
01:13:24,798 --> 01:13:28,782
Lenora, my child.
You have grown up rather beautiful.

490
01:13:29,972 --> 01:13:32,201
Or do I flatter myself?

491
01:13:32,611 --> 01:13:34,859
No. You're dead!

492
01:13:35,443 --> 01:13:37,790
A temporary inconvenience!

493
01:13:38,004 --> 01:13:41,819
After one more feeding I
shall become completely resurrected.

494
01:13:42,380 --> 01:13:45,543
I believe that honour shall
be bestowed upon your father.

495
01:14:12,274 --> 01:14:16,172
Lenora! Lenora!

496
01:14:49,275 --> 01:14:50,705
Gault?

497
01:14:56,931 --> 01:15:00,244
- Gault, how did you know?
- Gideon.

498
01:15:01,239 --> 01:15:03,742
He thought Morella would draw you here.

499
01:15:05,842 --> 01:15:07,839
What do you want from me?

500
01:15:08,276 --> 01:15:12,031
It's what I want to give you. Immortality!

501
01:15:12,498 --> 01:15:15,157
Mankind's eternal dream!

502
01:15:15,595 --> 01:15:18,794
Imagine, centuries shall pass.

503
01:15:19,144 --> 01:15:24,673
And all mortals will live and
die. But we shall exist forever.

504
01:15:25,739 --> 01:15:28,210
No, you once tried to kill me!

505
01:15:28,245 --> 01:15:32,404
Poor Gideon thought a sacrifice
was only your initiation.

506
01:15:33,172 --> 01:15:37,996
Tonight you and I shall
complete those rites together.

507
01:15:38,264 --> 01:15:39,139
No!

508
01:15:39,174 --> 01:15:42,030
No, I don't want to be like you!

509
01:15:52,811 --> 01:15:54,040
Guy!

510
01:15:55,095 --> 01:15:56,881
Lenora!

511
01:16:04,858 --> 01:16:06,995
Lenora!

512
01:16:08,531 --> 01:16:12,537
Lenora! You are mine!

513
01:16:14,347 --> 01:16:15,458
Yes.

514
01:16:16,116 --> 01:16:18,427
Yes, yes, you are mine!

515
01:16:20,771 --> 01:16:23,450
- Lenora!
- Morella! 

516
01:16:29,564 --> 01:16:32,518
I'm the one you want!

517
01:16:33,251 --> 01:16:34,696
Father!

518
01:16:35,772 --> 01:16:43,671
Gideon, my beloved. The one whom I swore
to honour and obey, til death do us part.

519
01:16:44,058 --> 01:16:47,028
I knew Lenora would bring you to me.

520
01:16:47,393 --> 01:16:49,477
Then you no longer control her?

521
01:16:50,541 --> 01:16:55,031
For the moment. Rest assured
she shall be mine forever.

522
01:16:55,793 --> 01:16:59,419
Lenora, leave this place.

523
01:17:00,937 --> 01:17:03,575
Prepare yourself, Gideon!

524
01:17:12,215 --> 01:17:16,896
You've become old. There was
a time when you were handsome.

525
01:17:17,280 --> 01:17:18,791
Yes.

526
01:17:19,221 --> 01:17:24,656
And there was a time when
your soul was so beautiful.

527
01:17:25,568 --> 01:17:27,578
Both have passed.

528
01:17:27,931 --> 01:17:33,303
Then come my husband. Let our
bodies enfold in one final embrace.

529
01:17:35,037 --> 01:17:37,307
My flesh needs sustenance.

530
01:17:37,342 --> 01:17:40,425
And your life shall fill that need.

531
01:17:40,460 --> 01:17:46,143
Yes, we shall be together always, my love.

532
01:17:49,872 --> 01:17:51,337
No!

533
01:17:52,274 --> 01:17:53,899
Father, no!

534
01:17:55,870 --> 01:17:57,632
No, father!

535
01:17:58,210 --> 01:18:01,037
Let me go, let me go!

536
01:18:11,432 --> 01:18:13,088
No!

537
01:18:33,721 --> 01:18:37,473
- Don't look!
- No, I need to see.

538
01:18:38,289 --> 01:18:43,185
- I need to remember.
- May they both find peace at last.

539
01:18:57,780 --> 01:19:01,600
I still live!
