1
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:27,076
Don't lie to me.
I know that something is up.

2
00:01:27,153 --> 00:01:30,088
Why do we have to keep talking
about this? It's over.

3
00:01:30,156 --> 00:01:32,181
Look, he's not all that anyway.

4
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:35,318
- But I like him.
- Marisol, it's a free country.

5
00:01:35,395 --> 00:01:38,330
Just because you have a crush on him
doesn't mean you own him.

6
00:01:38,398 --> 00:01:41,333
You didn't even notice him
until you found out I liked him.

7
00:01:41,401 --> 00:01:43,631
- Please. Get over yourself.
- It's true.

8
00:01:43,703 --> 00:01:46,866
You could have any boy you want
in this school, and you choose him.

9
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:49,932
Look, nothing happened.
Okay?

10
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:52,136
Can we be friends now?

11
00:01:52,212 --> 00:01:53,804
You fucked him.

12
00:01:54,981 --> 00:01:56,073
I did not.

13
00:01:56,149 --> 00:01:57,946
You're lying.

14
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:03,186
You had sex with him?

15
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:05,924
Guzman, you suck.

16
00:02:05,992 --> 00:02:11,191
It didn't mean anything to me. If he
prefers me over you, is that my problem?

17
00:02:11,264 --> 00:02:14,256
Maybe it's time
you took a look in the mirror.

18
00:02:14,334 --> 00:02:16,234
It's time for a makeover.

19
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:18,933
Apologize to her.

20
00:02:19,005 --> 00:02:21,940
- Excuse me?
- You heard me. Say you're sorry.

21
00:02:22,008 --> 00:02:25,409
Yeah, right.
Come on, girls, let's bounce.

22
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:32,918
I'm telling you,
that bitch is psycho.

23
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:48,328
Get off me, you fuckin' bitch!

24
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,969
Jesus.
<i>American Gladiators.</i>

25
00:02:57,877 --> 00:03:00,038
Show's over.

26
00:03:00,113 --> 00:03:02,308
You kids are late for class.

27
00:03:02,382 --> 00:03:04,407
You're fucking crazy, Guzman!

28
00:03:04,484 --> 00:03:06,748
- You started it, you fuckin' bitch!
- Enough!

29
00:03:06,819 --> 00:03:08,753
- She's lying!
- Yo, Tiny, check your sister!

30
00:03:08,821 --> 00:03:11,847
- You know what you did.
- Both of you are at fault.

31
00:03:11,925 --> 00:03:15,190
- I didn't do nothing!
- Except be your stinky, skanky self.

32
00:03:15,261 --> 00:03:18,321
I said hustle, or all of you
end up in detention!

33
00:03:18,398 --> 00:03:21,026
Report after school,
or you're suspended.

34
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:23,125
See you.

35
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:26,036
You are another story.
Now come on.

36
00:03:26,105 --> 00:03:29,438
This is your fourth fight
this semester.

37
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:32,444
You simply can't continue
to behave like this.

38
00:03:32,512 --> 00:03:36,448
Have you ever considered
how much more effective it would be...

39
00:03:36,516 --> 00:03:38,950
to talk about your disagreement?

40
00:03:40,453 --> 00:03:43,388
You have a serious problem.

41
00:03:43,456 --> 00:03:48,393
In or out of school, your life
is only gonna get harder because of it.

42
00:03:48,461 --> 00:03:52,090
You might want us to find someone
who can help you deal with this.

43
00:03:52,165 --> 00:03:54,395
I don't need any help.

44
00:03:56,669 --> 00:04:00,799
Fine. It's up to you.
I am out of options.

45
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:04,338
One more fight,
and you're expelled.

46
00:04:05,044 --> 00:04:06,978
Who cares if I'm expelled?

47
00:04:07,046 --> 00:04:10,709
Diana, ask yourself
that question.

48
00:04:10,783 --> 00:04:13,684
<i>Up the ante. Up.</i>

49
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:16,586
- Money on the wood.
- Hey there, it's Diana.

50
00:04:16,656 --> 00:04:18,954
Oh, yeah,
the gym's probably closed by now.

51
00:04:19,025 --> 00:04:21,960
- I got held up at school.
- You in trouble again?

52
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:27,699
Here. Tell Hector I'll have
the rest for him next week.

53
00:04:28,668 --> 00:04:30,761
Not after this game.

54
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:34,505
- Where am I going?
- Take the 61 to York.

55
00:04:34,574 --> 00:04:36,872
It's near the water.

56
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:39,036
Why you sending your girl
down there?

57
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:42,775
'Cause she's paying Hector.
My good man from Panama's training Tiny.

58
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:47,351
Man, you're the living likeness
of your mother.

59
00:04:48,154 --> 00:04:50,247
- I was just saying...
- Just play.

60
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:56,358
Later.

61
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:16,197
You need some variety.
I give it to you.

62
00:06:18,177 --> 00:06:20,338
I'm looking for Hector.

63
00:06:20,413 --> 00:06:22,347
The ring in the back.

64
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:28,653
The right, Tiny.

65
00:06:34,794 --> 00:06:36,386
Remember your combinations, Tiny.

66
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:43,259
- Last round.
- You said we go to four.

67
00:06:43,336 --> 00:06:44,826
He's not ready.

68
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:46,337
Not ready, huh?

69
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:50,740
Where the hell's Don?

70
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:54,576
- What's up?
- You better keep your eye on this bozo.

71
00:06:54,647 --> 00:06:57,582
- He don't listen to a word I say.
- Well, make him listen.

72
00:07:10,997 --> 00:07:13,022
What the fuck?

73
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:15,033
That's my brother, you little shit.

74
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:17,296
Let me go!
I'm gonna get her!

75
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:19,861
I gotta put you in a cage?

76
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:22,737
- The ho hit me first.
- I mean that crap in the ring.

77
00:07:22,809 --> 00:07:25,744
It's embarrassing. Being beaten twice
in a day makes me look like a pussy.

78
00:07:25,812 --> 00:07:27,973
Hey, watch your mouth.

79
00:07:28,047 --> 00:07:30,538
- Why'd you mess with Ray like that?
- He's a punk, Tiny.

80
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:34,052
- We were sparring.
- It didn't look that way to me.

81
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,816
Here, this is from my dad.

82
00:07:36,889 --> 00:07:39,221
You Sandro's kid too?

83
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:44,229
- How come I never heard about you?
- I don't know. I'm his pride and joy.

84
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:46,231
Jesus Christ.

85
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:48,426
Nice meeting you.

86
00:07:49,202 --> 00:07:51,466
Yeah.

87
00:07:53,539 --> 00:07:55,439
You been humiliated.

88
00:07:55,508 --> 00:07:59,911
You fight dirty with a little kid.
Then you got slaped by a little girl.

89
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:01,412
That's weak, Ray.

90
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:04,041
The bitch is lucky
I didn't kill her.

91
00:08:04,116 --> 00:08:07,051
- You spared her some mighty force, huh?
- That's right.

92
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:11,980
Who's the dish?

93
00:08:12,058 --> 00:08:14,720
Should have me a taste
and find out.

94
00:08:14,794 --> 00:08:16,728
Little man.

95
00:08:16,796 --> 00:08:19,230
- You know I was just playin', right?
- I know.

96
00:08:19,298 --> 00:08:21,061
Can we shake?

97
00:08:21,133 --> 00:08:23,465
Thought you had a friend.

98
00:08:23,536 --> 00:08:24,969
Come on, man.

99
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,133
Hey, killer.

100
00:08:30,209 --> 00:08:31,642
I forgive you too.

101
00:08:31,711 --> 00:08:33,508
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

102
00:08:33,579 --> 00:08:36,639
I mean, I guess you never
learned how to be a lady.

103
00:08:41,387 --> 00:08:43,321
You shouldn't hit people
like that.

104
00:08:45,925 --> 00:08:47,859
I couldn't resist.

105
00:08:47,927 --> 00:08:49,861
Tiny, let's go.

106
00:08:56,269 --> 00:08:59,329
Got that scholarship application
I told you about.

107
00:08:59,405 --> 00:09:01,896
- For that art school?
- Yeah. It's cool.

108
00:09:01,974 --> 00:09:04,909
You gotta learn all kinds of stuff
before you can do any work.

109
00:09:04,977 --> 00:09:07,104
You know,
to get a foundation.

110
00:09:07,179 --> 00:09:09,704
You would think that's cool.

111
00:09:09,782 --> 00:09:12,444
Sounds like
a waste of time to me.

112
00:09:12,518 --> 00:09:15,817
Learn how to draw.
What's that gonna get you, Tiny?

113
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:19,483
Ajob painting somebody's house
out in Long Island somewhere?

114
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,390
Maybe.

115
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:23,394
Edward clean you out
like he said he would?

116
00:09:23,462 --> 00:09:26,898
Yeah, well, he screws himself
when he talks like that.

117
00:09:33,706 --> 00:09:35,264
I'm not finished.

118
00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:36,774
I know.

119
00:09:39,178 --> 00:09:41,738
So, how was school, champ?

120
00:09:41,814 --> 00:09:44,840
It was okay.
Lots of excitement.

121
00:09:45,718 --> 00:09:48,186
When I was a kid,
school was so boring...

122
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:50,848
I thought I'd piss in my pants
waiting to get out in the world.

123
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:52,515
So, did it happen?

124
00:09:53,359 --> 00:09:54,883
What?

125
00:09:54,961 --> 00:09:57,054
Did you get out in the world?

126
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:00,098
What kind of question is that?

127
00:10:02,234 --> 00:10:03,166
Dad.

128
00:10:12,812 --> 00:10:14,746
It's Ms. Martinez.

129
00:10:18,517 --> 00:10:19,950
When?

130
00:10:22,388 --> 00:10:24,322
No, she didn't mention it.

131
00:10:25,391 --> 00:10:26,824
Yes.

132
00:10:30,262 --> 00:10:31,695
Yeah.

133
00:10:32,999 --> 00:10:34,432
Okay.

134
00:10:51,283 --> 00:10:54,719
Why you always gotta
fuck up like this, huh?

135
00:10:54,787 --> 00:10:56,721
Veronica asked for it.

136
00:11:00,292 --> 00:11:04,228
You embarrass me. Sometimes
I don't even think you're mine.

137
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:08,729
Maybe I'm not your kid.

138
00:11:08,801 --> 00:11:12,237
That better be cleaned up
by the time I come back.

139
00:11:47,473 --> 00:11:50,408
If I was enough of a skeez,
I could pull that off.

140
00:11:50,476 --> 00:11:52,410
Why would you want to?

141
00:11:54,313 --> 00:11:56,247
Veronica say anything to you?

142
00:11:56,315 --> 00:11:58,681
Yeah, if she wants
to choke on her teeth.

143
00:11:58,751 --> 00:12:00,685
Always with
that damn mirror of hers.

144
00:12:00,753 --> 00:12:04,814
"Let me get made up just perfect
so I can suck your dick...

145
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:06,824
which is all I'm good for
anyway."

146
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:09,326
- Let it rest with her already.
- How come?

147
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:12,057
Because she can be bitchy,
but that's not all she's about.

148
00:12:12,131 --> 00:12:15,066
- Some fucking loyalty.
- Don't be like that.

149
00:12:15,134 --> 00:12:18,069
She treats you like shit.
WHy take her side?

150
00:12:18,137 --> 00:12:19,695
Diana, I don't take sides.

151
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:23,838
Veronica don't even mean
half the stuff she says.

152
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:29,413
Look, I just wanna be friends
with everybody. That's the way I am.

153
00:12:29,482 --> 00:12:32,576
Yeah, well, I hate her,
and that's the way I am.

154
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:37,885
<i>Set his wife on fire,</i>
<i>then fatally shot himself.</i>

155
00:12:37,957 --> 00:12:41,256
<i>Neighbors of the slain woman</i>
<i>expressed shock and sorrow today as</i>...

156
00:13:26,272 --> 00:13:28,536
Knock knock.

157
00:13:28,607 --> 00:13:30,871
It was open.

158
00:13:32,578 --> 00:13:35,046
You here to beat me up?

159
00:13:35,114 --> 00:13:38,550
Remember her from the other day?
The bare knuckles.

160
00:13:38,617 --> 00:13:40,312
You should've seen Ray's face.

161
00:13:42,555 --> 00:13:45,353
Hey, I'm trying to say something.

162
00:13:45,424 --> 00:13:48,825
I wanna train with you.
I wanna be a boxer.

163
00:13:50,062 --> 00:13:51,996
Sure.
It's a great workout.

164
00:13:52,064 --> 00:13:55,465
No, for real.
I wanna fight.

165
00:13:55,534 --> 00:13:59,493
- You can train, but you can't fight.
- Why not?

166
00:14:00,372 --> 00:14:02,431
You just can't.

167
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:04,772
Girls don't have
the same power as boys.

168
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:06,607
Why not aerobics?

169
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,814
Am I talking to you?

170
00:14:09,882 --> 00:14:11,144
Nice.

171
00:14:12,551 --> 00:14:15,987
There's plenty of things you can do
better with your life than box.

172
00:14:16,722 --> 00:14:18,690
Prove it.

173
00:14:22,661 --> 00:14:25,357
You got money?
'Cause I don't work for free.

174
00:14:26,432 --> 00:14:28,024
A little.

175
00:14:29,101 --> 00:14:32,366
I charge $10 a session,
and that's cut-rate.

176
00:14:32,438 --> 00:14:34,702
I don't have
that kind of cash.

177
00:14:37,176 --> 00:14:39,110
Well, there you go.

178
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:06,136
- Dad?
- Hmm?

179
00:15:06,205 --> 00:15:09,231
You know how you pay for Tiny
to train with Hector?

180
00:15:10,476 --> 00:15:13,707
Well, I was thinking on
how that's like an allowance.

181
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:17,681
And I should get one too.

182
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,218
It's not an allowance.

183
00:15:20,286 --> 00:15:22,618
Then what is it?

184
00:15:22,688 --> 00:15:24,815
I'm preparing him
for the world out there.

185
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:26,824
- Yeah, but...
- Look, it's insurance.

186
00:15:26,892 --> 00:15:29,326
These kids are gonna
eat him alive.

187
00:15:29,395 --> 00:15:32,728
- That's not true.
- Tiny, it is true.

188
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:35,858
What if he doesn't want to box?

189
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:38,529
Sure, he wants to.
What kid wouldn't?

190
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:43,564
He could go to college, Dad. He could
do all sorts of stuff with himself.

191
00:15:43,642 --> 00:15:47,271
You think I don't know that? You think
this is just spending money for him?

192
00:15:47,346 --> 00:15:52,010
He ain't over at A&S Plaza buying
lipstick or whatever you girls do there.

193
00:15:52,084 --> 00:15:55,679
Please. Don't front like I'm some
girly-girl when you know I'm not.

194
00:15:57,823 --> 00:16:00,519
Would it kill you
to wear a skirt once in a while?

195
00:16:06,198 --> 00:16:08,223
Look, your mother
was a receptionist...

196
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,234
in a very nice office.

197
00:16:13,605 --> 00:16:16,438
You want some extra money,
get a job.

198
00:16:16,508 --> 00:16:19,238
I ain't giving you anything
until you show me you deserve it.

199
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:22,212
It's not like you
give me anything anyway.

200
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,935
You think I don't hear you?
Shut up, already.

201
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:45,937
Stop doing that.

202
00:17:40,459 --> 00:17:41,892
You again.

203
00:17:44,763 --> 00:17:47,459
Relax. Jab. Jab.

204
00:17:48,667 --> 00:17:50,362
What are you doing here?

205
00:17:50,436 --> 00:17:54,065
- I got the money.
- I didn't promise nothing.

206
00:17:54,139 --> 00:17:56,073
You said
once I got the cash.

207
00:17:56,141 --> 00:17:58,701
You seem like a nice kid.
It's just not right.

208
00:17:58,777 --> 00:17:59,835
Diana...

209
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:03,040
This is bullshit. You said
once I got the money, and now I do.

210
00:18:03,115 --> 00:18:05,549
Wait a minute.
You're gonna train with Hector?

211
00:18:05,617 --> 00:18:06,549
Yeah.

212
00:18:06,618 --> 00:18:08,245
- Why?
- Why not?

213
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,345
Well, what about Papi?

214
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:13,789
- You tell Dad, and I'll kill you.
- Take it easy!

215
00:18:13,859 --> 00:18:15,326
Please.

216
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:19,663
I'll train you.

217
00:18:20,732 --> 00:18:21,824
You will?

218
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:25,165
If you don't sweat for me,
you're out of my life. Got it?

219
00:18:25,237 --> 00:18:26,602
- Got it.
- Oh, man!

220
00:18:27,906 --> 00:18:29,840
Tiny, come on.

221
00:18:31,543 --> 00:18:33,170
Fuck.
Now he hates me.

222
00:18:33,245 --> 00:18:36,681
Rule number one...
no personal business in the gym.

223
00:18:51,396 --> 00:18:53,455
Watch me.

224
00:18:55,767 --> 00:18:58,531
Hands close to your body,
hands up to your face.

225
00:18:58,604 --> 00:19:01,095
Jab. Snap, snap.
Springs back to you.

226
00:19:01,173 --> 00:19:02,572
Snap, snap,
springs back to you.

227
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:04,131
Twist it.

228
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:10,314
Now throw the right.

229
00:19:15,053 --> 00:19:17,749
Soon you won't think
while you're doing this.

230
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:19,620
You'll be daydreaming.

231
00:19:20,392 --> 00:19:22,690
What's that, huh?
What's that?

232
00:19:22,761 --> 00:19:24,695
You got no balance that way.

233
00:19:29,234 --> 00:19:30,292
Better.

234
00:19:37,709 --> 00:19:41,839
Nothing stays still in the ring.
Move around the bag more.

235
00:19:41,914 --> 00:19:43,313
Watch your footwork.

236
00:20:09,007 --> 00:20:10,440
You can't stop.

237
00:20:17,783 --> 00:20:19,273
Ninety-eight...

238
00:20:20,986 --> 00:20:22,283
ninety-nine...

239
00:20:22,354 --> 00:20:23,787
Come on, last one.

240
00:20:27,292 --> 00:20:29,226
You're done for today.

241
00:20:29,294 --> 00:20:31,728
Go see Ira
about getting a locker.

242
00:20:34,466 --> 00:20:36,957
Sure, he'll make the weight.

243
00:20:37,035 --> 00:20:40,527
The kid's been sleeping in Saran Wrap
for the past two weeks.

244
00:20:42,774 --> 00:20:47,040
Hey, who's bright idea was it to
keep him at junior lightweight, anyway?

245
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:50,171
Exactly.

246
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:52,843
Saturday, he'll be at 29.

247
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,883
Okay.
Talk to you later.

248
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:02,350
You're the girl
Hector told me about.

249
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:04,657
- You need a locker.
- Yeah.

250
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:07,665
Well, we ain't big-time, hon.

251
00:21:07,733 --> 00:21:10,361
We're not really set up
for the ladies yet.

252
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:15,866
This neighborhood don't really catch on
with the lawyer types.

253
00:21:19,878 --> 00:21:22,506
We don't use this
too much anymore.

254
00:21:22,581 --> 00:21:25,175
It's yours if you want
to throw your stuff somewhere.

255
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:26,683
Thanks.

256
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:11,660
Okay, what is mass?

257
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:16,099
Mass is the measure of
a body's resistance...

258
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:18,796
to acceleration.

259
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:23,807
It is different from
but proportional to that body's weight.

260
00:22:23,875 --> 00:22:25,740
What is weight?

261
00:22:25,811 --> 00:22:29,406
Weight is
the gravitational force...

262
00:22:29,481 --> 00:22:32,143
exerted by the Earth
on that body.

263
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:35,286
Now, this is why...

264
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:39,290
if a body is outside
the Earth's gravitational pull...

265
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:41,189
Girls.

266
00:22:41,259 --> 00:22:43,955
I think you both
know how this works.

267
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:46,793
- Yes, Mr. Coolidge.
- Yes, Mr. Coolidge.

268
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:48,196
This is why...

269
00:22:49,334 --> 00:22:50,926
Make a fist.

270
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,273
How's that feel?

271
00:22:56,341 --> 00:22:57,774
Feels good.

272
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:05,315
Jab, jab.

273
00:23:06,485 --> 00:23:08,112
Jab, right.

274
00:23:08,186 --> 00:23:11,280
Good, now jab, right, hook.

275
00:23:13,925 --> 00:23:15,017
Too wide.

276
00:23:34,946 --> 00:23:37,540
- How long is this going to last?
- What are you talking about?

277
00:23:37,616 --> 00:23:40,779
"What are you talking about?"
Stop being such a tough guy.

278
00:23:40,852 --> 00:23:43,616
What do you gotta do this for?
You can't pay for it.

279
00:23:43,688 --> 00:23:45,986
- What do you care?
- You should tell Dad.

280
00:23:46,057 --> 00:23:48,958
Are you for real?
This would drive him nuts.

281
00:23:49,027 --> 00:23:52,292
- Keep your mouth shut.
- I can't believe you sometimes.

282
00:23:55,534 --> 00:23:57,593
You still got two rounds.

283
00:23:57,669 --> 00:23:59,728
Yeah, but I can't do it right.

284
00:23:59,805 --> 00:24:02,365
Then get back over there
till you can.

285
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:04,932
But it's pissing me off.

286
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:09,674
It's pissing you off? What, do you think
this is gonna happen overnight? Huh?

287
00:24:09,748 --> 00:24:11,841
You think it came natural
to these guys?

288
00:24:11,917 --> 00:24:14,852
You think it's gonna
come natural to you? Huh?

289
00:24:22,427 --> 00:24:25,726
This time work the bag
slow and steady...

290
00:24:25,797 --> 00:24:28,732
and don't stop
till the red light goes out.

291
00:24:36,007 --> 00:24:39,443
What you laughing at?
You laughing at me? Huh?

292
00:24:47,619 --> 00:24:49,780
Oh, <i>mira,</i> look.

293
00:24:49,855 --> 00:24:51,823
Your bodyguard.

294
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:55,587
Guess the slave girls get a day off
when you slum it with Marisol.

295
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:58,390
I've had it with your dismal crap.
You're sick.

296
00:24:58,463 --> 00:25:00,897
- You don't even know me.
- I know all I have to.

297
00:25:00,966 --> 00:25:04,402
- Quit it.
- She hangs out with you to get to me.

298
00:25:04,469 --> 00:25:07,836
You should know. You're
the center of the universe, right?

299
00:25:07,906 --> 00:25:10,238
It's the truth.

300
00:25:10,308 --> 00:25:12,242
We're gonna be late.

301
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:16,438
Later, Diana.

302
00:25:19,551 --> 00:25:21,485
You said you'd do my braids.

303
00:25:21,553 --> 00:25:25,819
Yeah? Well, call me when there's
an opening in your busy schedule.

304
00:25:44,809 --> 00:25:46,003
Jab, jab.

305
00:25:48,647 --> 00:25:50,080
Jab, jab, right.

306
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:54,614
Too much power.
Let's just box for now.

307
00:25:57,722 --> 00:26:00,657
Hey, you deaf?
I said too much power.

308
00:26:03,161 --> 00:26:05,095
Jab, right, hook.

309
00:26:08,033 --> 00:26:11,332
You been working on your hook.
This time finish it with an uppercut.

310
00:26:12,504 --> 00:26:13,937
Same combination.

311
00:26:16,975 --> 00:26:20,069
All force and no technique, huh?

312
00:26:20,145 --> 00:26:21,339
Come on.

313
00:26:26,484 --> 00:26:28,349
Power is half the story.

314
00:26:29,454 --> 00:26:31,183
Are you scared of me?

315
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:35,589
- That's funny. You look scared.
- I'm not scared.

316
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:39,323
I got you against the ropes,
and I'm gonna dance on your face.

317
00:26:43,535 --> 00:26:44,866
See?

318
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:48,394
Someone gets you where you don't
wanna be, you get outta the way.

319
00:26:48,473 --> 00:26:51,101
Keep your footwork smaller.

320
00:26:53,411 --> 00:26:55,572
That way you can punch
from different angles, okay?

321
00:26:55,647 --> 00:26:57,114
Try it.

322
00:27:03,955 --> 00:27:06,048
Now we're boxing.

323
00:27:07,659 --> 00:27:12,096
You should start roadwork.
Run three miles four times a week.

324
00:27:12,163 --> 00:27:14,688
Three miles?
You gotta be kidding me.

325
00:27:14,766 --> 00:27:16,427
At least three.

326
00:27:16,501 --> 00:27:19,561
At this rate, you couldn't last
one round in the ring.

327
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:23,967
But I got power.
You said so.

328
00:27:24,042 --> 00:27:25,669
Big deal.

329
00:27:25,744 --> 00:27:29,202
You got the endurance of a corpse.

330
00:27:32,117 --> 00:27:35,245
I guess I'll use
the track at school.

331
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,914
Don't bother about
clocking yourself yet.

332
00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:47,989
So were you ever a fighter?

333
00:27:48,066 --> 00:27:49,431
Oh, sure.

334
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:51,765
In Panama.

335
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:53,997
I had my day once.

336
00:27:55,807 --> 00:27:57,900
So, what happened?

337
00:27:59,611 --> 00:28:01,943
What happens to most of us
who do it?

338
00:28:04,049 --> 00:28:05,516
We lose.

339
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:09,847
There's only two of you
in that ring.

340
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:13,249
It can be a lonely place.

341
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:15,253
How're you doin'?

342
00:28:15,326 --> 00:28:17,260
Have you seen Adrian?

343
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:21,262
Yo, Adrian!
You got a visitor.

344
00:28:26,938 --> 00:28:29,202
Most of these guys here,
what are they...

345
00:28:29,274 --> 00:28:31,242
just dreamin'?

346
00:28:31,309 --> 00:28:33,834
Sure, they are.
They got no choice.

347
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:38,706
These guys, this is what they live for.
This is their whole life.

348
00:28:38,783 --> 00:28:40,808
Was it like that for you?

349
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:42,318
To fight?

350
00:28:43,521 --> 00:28:44,954
Probably not.

351
00:28:46,291 --> 00:28:49,317
I didn't have what it takes.

352
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:53,387
So what does it take?

353
00:28:53,465 --> 00:28:55,399
To be great, I mean.

354
00:28:56,601 --> 00:28:58,535
I don't know.

355
00:29:00,672 --> 00:29:03,470
A real strong will.

356
00:29:06,311 --> 00:29:09,007
I was gonna go to a fight
at the Forum next week.

357
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:11,139
If you want to see
some lightweight action...

358
00:29:11,216 --> 00:29:14,379
Ira gets discount tickets sometimes.

359
00:29:14,452 --> 00:29:16,420
I can come?

360
00:29:16,488 --> 00:29:18,479
It's no big thing.

361
00:29:19,224 --> 00:29:21,021
For real?

362
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:23,754
Maybe you'll learn something.

363
00:29:23,828 --> 00:29:25,625
Yeah.

364
00:29:25,697 --> 00:29:27,187
Oh, here.

365
00:29:34,005 --> 00:29:35,438
Thanks.

366
00:29:48,153 --> 00:29:52,385
I hope you've all completed
the assigned reading...

367
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:54,857
and finished your workbooks.

368
00:29:54,926 --> 00:29:56,894
This chapter deals with...

369
00:29:56,961 --> 00:30:01,625
a fundamental concept in science...

370
00:30:01,699 --> 00:30:05,328
the second law of thermodynamics.

371
00:30:05,403 --> 00:30:09,169
The primary element of this law...

372
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,800
is a word that we use all the time...

373
00:30:11,876 --> 00:30:14,037
though it's tough to define.

374
00:30:14,112 --> 00:30:16,740
That word is "heat."

375
00:30:17,949 --> 00:30:20,417
What is heat anyway?

376
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:23,215
A simple definition is this:

377
00:30:23,288 --> 00:30:26,883
Heat is the energy
possessed by molecules...

378
00:30:26,958 --> 00:30:29,654
<i>because of their motion.</i>

379
00:30:29,727 --> 00:30:33,424
<i>It takes part</i>
<i>in every physical occurrence...</i>

380
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:36,160
<i>from the growth</i>
<i>of one blade of grass...</i>

381
00:30:36,234 --> 00:30:38,099
<i>to...</i>

382
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:41,002
<i>a key starting a car's engine...</i>

383
00:30:41,072 --> 00:30:43,768
<i>to the explosion of a star.</i>

384
00:30:59,457 --> 00:31:01,391
Testing those reflexes.

385
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:16,431
Friday you spar.

386
00:31:16,507 --> 00:31:18,202
I'm ready to?

387
00:31:18,276 --> 00:31:20,039
You're a quick study.

388
00:31:20,111 --> 00:31:21,373
I am?

389
00:31:21,446 --> 00:31:24,142
You gotta pay me for last week.

390
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:32,119
- It's real silver.
- I can't sell it with these pictures.

391
00:31:36,461 --> 00:31:38,395
Strangers to everyone but you, huh?

392
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:41,498
Yeah.

393
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:44,330
- I'll give you 40 bucks for it.
- That's all?

394
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:46,836
It's not worth more than that.

395
00:31:47,972 --> 00:31:49,234
Sixty.

396
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:52,334
Gimme a break.

397
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:53,843
Please?

398
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:59,006
I'll give you 50 bucks.
Final offer.

399
00:32:18,369 --> 00:32:20,428
You sure this is a good idea?

400
00:32:20,505 --> 00:32:22,439
Ray knows... no funny stuff.

401
00:32:22,507 --> 00:32:24,532
Try to be a gentleman.

402
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:28,374
Just keep it loose.
No pressure.

403
00:32:28,446 --> 00:32:30,710
Take it easy on me this time, okay?

404
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:33,273
Don't be a dick, and I'll try.

405
00:32:33,351 --> 00:32:35,546
Why did he have to say that?

406
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:37,087
Ignore him. Here.

407
00:32:50,668 --> 00:32:52,260
How's it workin' with her?

408
00:32:52,337 --> 00:32:54,897
Gotta pay the bills.

409
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:57,908
When you get that desperate,
borrow from me.

410
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:12,822
Hey, Frankie, let's put in
some quality time.

411
00:33:17,395 --> 00:33:19,329
- Sorry.
- Come on!

412
00:33:19,397 --> 00:33:21,490
Don't be sorry.
Don't ever be sorry.

413
00:33:21,566 --> 00:33:23,500
Look at him.

414
00:34:05,943 --> 00:34:07,103
Okay.

415
00:34:07,178 --> 00:34:09,544
Whey you throw your jab...
Spit.

416
00:34:09,614 --> 00:34:14,142
Rush him with some of the combinations
we been working on, okay?

417
00:34:14,218 --> 00:34:16,652
It's like I forgot everything
you've been teaching me.

418
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:20,020
Stop thinking so much.
You're doin' good.

419
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:26,496
You've been working hard.

420
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:28,657
- Yeah, I guess so.
- Guess so?

421
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:31,395
Cal's got you conditioned
real good.

422
00:34:31,469 --> 00:34:32,902
Thanks.

423
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:36,934
I'll be seeing you, Hector.

424
00:34:37,008 --> 00:34:40,307
- How you gettin' home?
- The 61. I'm in Red Hook.

425
00:34:40,378 --> 00:34:42,312
I'm driving that way.

426
00:34:43,381 --> 00:34:45,315
I don't mind the bus.

427
00:34:45,383 --> 00:34:47,510
This place is deserted at night.

428
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:50,019
- I'll be fine.
- It's okay. No trouble.

429
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:52,022
I'm just in Gowanus.

430
00:35:03,034 --> 00:35:06,526
The "F" and the "G"
are my nightmare trains.

431
00:35:06,604 --> 00:35:08,538
"G" is the worst.

432
00:35:08,606 --> 00:35:11,700
No wonder people
move out of Queens.

433
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:13,368
You're lucky you have wheels.

434
00:35:14,846 --> 00:35:17,041
Lucky's winning the lottery.

435
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:19,174
My old man, he's a mechanic.

436
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:22,117
He has me running all around Brooklyn,
running errands for this ride.

437
00:35:22,186 --> 00:35:25,053
Always gotta be thinking "expansion."

438
00:35:27,925 --> 00:35:29,984
Anyway, you in high school?

439
00:35:30,061 --> 00:35:33,224
Yeah, my last year, I hope.

440
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:35,231
You still in school?

441
00:35:36,434 --> 00:35:39,460
- Am I immature or somethin'?
- No, I just thought...

442
00:35:39,537 --> 00:35:41,471
I'm just playing with you.

443
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,733
I graduated last year.

444
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:48,577
- My only achievement in life.
- Yeah, right.

445
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:50,409
It's true.

446
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:54,008
My mom cried when I got my diploma.

447
00:35:54,085 --> 00:35:55,518
That's nice.

448
00:36:04,395 --> 00:36:05,885
You gotta tell me where to turn.

449
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:10,930
We can stop right here.

450
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:12,936
- Right over here?
- Yeah.

451
00:36:16,741 --> 00:36:18,675
You live in a project?

452
00:36:19,677 --> 00:36:22,612
All my life.
Canales Community Houses.

453
00:36:27,952 --> 00:36:29,886
What floor you on?

454
00:36:29,954 --> 00:36:31,285
The 11 th.

455
00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:33,289
- You're up there.
- Yeah.

456
00:36:39,664 --> 00:36:41,598
Thanks for the ride.

457
00:36:41,666 --> 00:36:43,600
I'll be seeing you.

458
00:36:57,348 --> 00:36:59,282
What?

459
00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:02,217
- You're late.
- I was hanging out with Marisol.

460
00:37:02,286 --> 00:37:05,619
- Thank your brother for dinner.
- Thanks, bro.

461
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:10,218
And do me a favor.
After you eat, take a shower.

462
00:37:10,294 --> 00:37:11,727
You smell.

463
00:37:17,702 --> 00:37:19,636
I think I will.

464
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,344
You looked all right in there
with Ray today.

465
00:37:32,483 --> 00:37:34,974
It's more tiring than it looks, huh?

466
00:37:37,855 --> 00:37:41,689
What's he after anyway?
Making me fight.

467
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:43,693
I just want to make him happy.

468
00:37:44,862 --> 00:37:47,023
Lots of luck to you.

469
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:56,300
How can the history of the world
be so fucking boring?

470
00:37:56,374 --> 00:37:59,707
And all those people are dead too.

471
00:37:59,777 --> 00:38:03,440
You still holding a grudge against me
because of that Veronica thing?

472
00:38:03,514 --> 00:38:06,608
- If you are, I gotta tell you...
- You were holding a grudge against me.

473
00:38:06,684 --> 00:38:10,211
I was pissed at you
for stirring up shit.

474
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:12,222
I guess I was an idiot.

475
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:15,885
Shouldn't tell you who to hang out with,
even if your friends are lame.

476
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:19,225
I wanna hang out with you,
but you never wanna hang out with me.

477
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:22,232
Seems like you
always got places to go.

478
00:38:23,567 --> 00:38:25,899
You gonna deny
something's goin' on?

479
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:28,700
- You're gonna laugh at me.
- What?

480
00:38:28,773 --> 00:38:31,469
You're gonna think
I'm full of shit.

481
00:38:31,542 --> 00:38:33,737
- Is it a guy?
- No.

482
00:38:34,879 --> 00:38:38,747
- Is he at P.S. 20?
- No, it's not a guy.

483
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:40,249
Then what?

484
00:38:41,485 --> 00:38:43,749
I'm training to be a boxer.

485
00:38:43,821 --> 00:38:46,585
Oh, be serious!

486
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:49,319
I am serious.

487
00:38:49,393 --> 00:38:53,090
I'm training with Hector Soto at the
Brooklyn Athletic Club on Front Street.

488
00:38:54,465 --> 00:38:57,093
You mean, like pow-wow-wow?

489
00:38:58,502 --> 00:39:00,436
Oh, that's cool.

490
00:39:00,504 --> 00:39:02,438
You get hit?

491
00:39:04,408 --> 00:39:06,603
- In the face?
- It happens.

492
00:39:08,512 --> 00:39:10,673
You fight guys?

493
00:39:10,748 --> 00:39:13,342
That's all there is right now.

494
00:39:13,417 --> 00:39:16,443
You got guys
hitting you in the face?

495
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:19,887
You don't understand, Marisol.
It's like you're all you've got.

496
00:39:19,957 --> 00:39:22,619
You're all alone in there,
you know?

497
00:39:22,693 --> 00:39:24,627
I can't explain it exactly.

498
00:39:24,695 --> 00:39:27,562
You are crazy.
My crazy friend.

499
00:39:27,631 --> 00:39:29,792
It's fun, that's all.

500
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:31,801
Doesn't sound like fun to me.

501
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:34,360
Well, there is this one guy.

502
00:39:34,438 --> 00:39:36,372
I knew it. Name.

503
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:37,702
Adrian.

504
00:39:37,775 --> 00:39:40,300
Adrian?
What kind of girly name is that?

505
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:43,973
Hey, hundred percent man,
if you know what I mean?

506
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:45,640
And?

507
00:39:45,716 --> 00:39:47,240
And what?

508
00:39:47,318 --> 00:39:50,048
- How do you know about this percentage?
- Guesswork, Marisol.

509
00:39:50,121 --> 00:39:52,646
How come everything's
gotta be a romance with you?

510
00:39:52,723 --> 00:39:55,317
I live for that shit.
What can I say?

511
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:56,985
<i>Good evening,</i>
<i>ladies and gentlemen.</i>

512
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:58,596
<i>We'll give you the formal introductions,</i>
<i>if you don't mind.</i>

513
00:39:58,596 --> 00:40:00,325
<i>We'll give you the formal introductions,</i>
<i>if you don't mind.</i>

514
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:04,494
<i>Will all the boxers</i>
<i>kindly turn in their passports?</i>

515
00:40:04,568 --> 00:40:08,163
<i>Will all boxers turn in</i>
<i>their passports...</i>

516
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:11,174
<i>over here at ringside?</i>

517
00:40:24,388 --> 00:40:27,118
Piece of work, right?

518
00:40:27,191 --> 00:40:28,283
Who is he?

519
00:40:28,359 --> 00:40:29,883
Some hotshot promoter.

520
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:32,520
Always got new flesh to peddle.

521
00:40:41,038 --> 00:40:44,030
- Come sit with us.
- No, thanks. I got my chair over there.

522
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:46,337
Thanks anyway.

523
00:40:48,179 --> 00:40:50,238
Don't feel social?

524
00:40:50,314 --> 00:40:51,747
I understand.

525
00:41:15,673 --> 00:41:19,268
Two, three, four, five.

526
00:41:44,101 --> 00:41:46,035
Break. Break.

527
00:42:33,417 --> 00:42:35,885
So you're becoming a serious fan?

528
00:42:35,953 --> 00:42:37,887
- I liked that guy Lopez.
- Yeah.

529
00:42:37,955 --> 00:42:39,980
Garcia came back strong tonight.

530
00:42:40,057 --> 00:42:43,151
If my payday was as sweet as his,
I'd come out fighting too.

531
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:45,161
I bet you would.

532
00:42:46,363 --> 00:42:49,093
You think we could go get
something to eat? I'm starved.

533
00:42:49,166 --> 00:42:53,159
I can't.
Got a date with my wife tonight.

534
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:58,338
I'll have a bacon cheeseburger.

535
00:42:58,409 --> 00:43:00,639
Make it a deluxe with extra bacon.

536
00:43:00,711 --> 00:43:02,679
Rare.

537
00:43:02,746 --> 00:43:05,579
What? I said I was hungry.

538
00:43:05,649 --> 00:43:07,844
And for you?

539
00:43:07,918 --> 00:43:11,319
A cup of soup, a garden salad
with Italian dressing on the side.

540
00:43:11,388 --> 00:43:12,480
That's all.

541
00:43:13,324 --> 00:43:17,192
- What kind of dinner is that?
- Trying to stay at my weight.

542
00:43:17,261 --> 00:43:19,855
Got a lot of speedy fighters
in my division.

543
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:21,921
- You compete?
- Yeah.

544
00:43:21,999 --> 00:43:23,523
You like it?

545
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:26,069
Sure. Keeps me out of trouble.

546
00:43:26,136 --> 00:43:28,036
You a delinquent?

547
00:43:28,105 --> 00:43:30,039
Not anymore.

548
00:43:31,408 --> 00:43:34,275
- How come you train with Hector?
- You mean, like, at all?

549
00:43:34,345 --> 00:43:37,143
- Yeah.
- Because I want to.

550
00:43:37,214 --> 00:43:40,377
- Aren't you afraid of gettin' hurt?
- What, are you're not?

551
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:43,909
No, it's just...
It's a dangerous sport.

552
00:43:43,988 --> 00:43:47,185
I didn't make the cheerleading team.

553
00:43:50,094 --> 00:43:52,153
How long you train for?

554
00:43:52,229 --> 00:43:54,891
Almost a year. Cal's got
a whole plan mapped out for me.

555
00:43:58,969 --> 00:44:01,836
I might be lined up with Ray
in the next amateur heat.

556
00:44:01,905 --> 00:44:05,238
- Your favorite guy.
- I hope you cream that asshole.

557
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:15,380
He's not that bad.

558
00:44:15,452 --> 00:44:18,444
Yeah, just another harmless prick.

559
00:44:18,522 --> 00:44:20,786
You two are friends?

560
00:44:20,858 --> 00:44:24,191
I feel like I should lie
and say no.

561
00:44:24,261 --> 00:44:25,694
Don't lie.

562
00:44:26,764 --> 00:44:29,130
We grew up
in the same neighborhood.

563
00:44:29,199 --> 00:44:32,532
Yeah, he's cuckoo, he's fucked up.
You know, he's harmless.

564
00:44:32,603 --> 00:44:35,800
Not everybody's blessed
with brains and talent.

565
00:44:43,847 --> 00:44:46,680
So how come you didn't sit next
to Hector like he asked you to?

566
00:44:46,750 --> 00:44:48,684
'Cause I didn't feel like it.

567
00:44:48,752 --> 00:44:50,811
He thinks you're a good fighter.

568
00:44:50,888 --> 00:44:53,448
Hector got me started.

569
00:44:53,524 --> 00:44:56,118
Yeah? How come you still
don't train with him?

570
00:44:56,193 --> 00:44:58,923
Because I'd be 50 before
I got a pro fight with Hector.

571
00:45:00,264 --> 00:45:03,700
What's the sense in doing this
if I'm not gonna make any money, right?

572
00:45:03,767 --> 00:45:07,066
I can't work for my father forever.

573
00:45:08,305 --> 00:45:11,240
My little brother, right out of school,
he enlists in the marines.

574
00:45:11,308 --> 00:45:13,572
No, thank you.

575
00:45:13,644 --> 00:45:16,670
Besides, I don't think Hector
believed in me.

576
00:45:33,464 --> 00:45:35,830
You wanna see
where my mom was born?

577
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:40,059
Right there, 37 years ago.

578
00:45:54,918 --> 00:45:57,716
You didn't have to walk me home.

579
00:45:58,489 --> 00:46:00,423
I don't mind.

580
00:46:02,159 --> 00:46:05,492
I mean, I can take care of myself,
you know.

581
00:46:05,562 --> 00:46:06,995
I know.

582
00:46:07,064 --> 00:46:08,998
I wanted to.

583
00:46:19,510 --> 00:46:21,671
So what's it like in Gowanus?

584
00:46:22,846 --> 00:46:25,974
In places like this,
no one matters.

585
00:46:26,049 --> 00:46:27,983
No one and nothing.

586
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:31,781
That's not gonna be my life, man.

587
00:46:31,855 --> 00:46:34,790
I'm gonna turn pro,
and I'm gonna move far away from here.

588
00:46:34,858 --> 00:46:37,793
Someplace where I'm not gonna
get killed doing my laundry.

589
00:46:37,861 --> 00:46:41,228
Right. Or raped
in your own fucking stairway.

590
00:46:42,866 --> 00:46:44,800
Shot for a pair of shoes.

591
00:46:51,308 --> 00:46:55,836
That girl who's been at the gym,
all dolled up, watching you spar...

592
00:46:55,913 --> 00:46:57,847
Is she your girlfriend now?

593
00:46:57,915 --> 00:46:59,348
Karina?

594
00:47:01,218 --> 00:47:02,947
Sometimes.

595
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:05,648
Oh, so she's
your sometimes girlfriend.

596
00:47:05,722 --> 00:47:08,384
You know,
it's cool between us.

597
00:47:09,893 --> 00:47:12,361
She's pretty.

598
00:47:12,429 --> 00:47:14,363
Yeah, she is.

599
00:47:15,732 --> 00:47:18,860
She's sweet on me, but it's like
I don't have time to...

600
00:47:18,936 --> 00:47:20,870
- Be a Romeo?
- Yeah.

601
00:47:22,339 --> 00:47:24,432
Half the time...

602
00:47:24,508 --> 00:47:27,807
I get a feeling that she only likes me
'cause I wanna go pro.

603
00:47:27,878 --> 00:47:29,812
You being exploited?

604
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:31,313
I'm serious.

605
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:36,945
She's gorgeous and all that,
but it's like...

606
00:47:38,589 --> 00:47:41,786
sometimes we don't have much
to say to each other, you know?

607
00:47:41,859 --> 00:47:43,884
Sounds like a dream date
for most guys.

608
00:47:45,596 --> 00:47:47,530
Yeah, it is.

609
00:47:48,832 --> 00:47:51,801
Guess I don't know what I'm
supposed to be looking for anymore.

610
00:47:53,604 --> 00:47:56,198
Well, what do you want?

611
00:47:56,273 --> 00:47:58,207
Fuck if I know.

612
00:48:03,013 --> 00:48:04,947
Why'd you do that?

613
00:48:05,015 --> 00:48:06,949
I don't know.

614
00:48:22,266 --> 00:48:24,393
You taste sweet.

615
00:48:24,468 --> 00:48:26,527
Funny.

616
00:48:26,603 --> 00:48:29,197
I always thought of myself
as salty.

617
00:48:34,044 --> 00:48:36,672
You're wrong. You're sweet.

618
00:48:48,759 --> 00:48:50,693
I gotta go.

619
00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:55,694
I'll talk to you soon,
all right?

620
00:48:59,069 --> 00:49:00,502
Yeah.

621
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:12,214
Yo, where are you going?

622
00:49:17,287 --> 00:49:19,551
That time of year again, ladies.

623
00:49:19,623 --> 00:49:23,559
Time for the Presidential
Physical Fitness Exam.

624
00:49:23,627 --> 00:49:26,494
I don't give a shit what the president
thinks of my physical fitness.

625
00:49:26,563 --> 00:49:29,464
A mile's not gonna kill any of ya.

626
00:50:57,387 --> 00:50:59,821
This year, ladies.

627
00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:01,824
Good work, Guzman.

628
00:51:06,963 --> 00:51:10,558
Looks like those hormone treatments
really do the job.

629
00:51:10,634 --> 00:51:13,034
One more lap.

630
00:51:23,046 --> 00:51:25,014
She's got a good chin.

631
00:51:25,082 --> 00:51:27,346
I know.

632
00:51:29,719 --> 00:51:32,415
Hey, champion!
What are you doing here?

633
00:51:32,489 --> 00:51:34,753
Hi. Nice seeing you.

634
00:51:34,825 --> 00:51:37,726
Ah, man, I just seen that guy
fighting on TV yesterday.

635
00:51:38,695 --> 00:51:40,788
Good fight, champ.

636
00:51:46,903 --> 00:51:48,837
How you doin'?

637
00:51:57,114 --> 00:51:59,309
He popped you real good.

638
00:51:59,382 --> 00:52:02,215
I popped him back, didn't I?

639
00:52:02,285 --> 00:52:04,879
Well, you're getting the hang
of this game.

640
00:52:08,625 --> 00:52:09,887
You gonna walk home?

641
00:52:10,961 --> 00:52:12,895
I'm taking off.

642
00:52:16,633 --> 00:52:19,898
My dad will give me grief
if I keep coming home so late.

643
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:21,335
Does he know?

644
00:52:21,404 --> 00:52:22,894
Know what?

645
00:52:22,973 --> 00:52:24,406
About this?

646
00:52:26,309 --> 00:52:29,073
Not unless he has binoculars
this very second.

647
00:52:35,152 --> 00:52:37,086
So what exactly is this?

648
00:52:39,422 --> 00:52:40,855
Who knows?

649
00:52:45,195 --> 00:52:47,595
You still like me
with my black eye?

650
00:52:49,566 --> 00:52:51,500
I think I like you more.

651
00:53:14,791 --> 00:53:16,224
Hi, Dad.

652
00:53:18,261 --> 00:53:20,456
You stole money from me.

653
00:53:21,531 --> 00:53:24,659
- I'm gonna pay you back.
- Who's this guy you're running with?

654
00:53:32,342 --> 00:53:35,834
What the hell happened to you?
Did he do this to you?

655
00:53:35,912 --> 00:53:37,675
Adrian? No.

656
00:53:37,747 --> 00:53:40,614
- How could you let him do this to you?
- Get away from me.

657
00:53:41,551 --> 00:53:45,248
That's how it goes? You hook up
with a creep who knocks you around?

658
00:53:45,322 --> 00:53:47,950
Right. You're so reformed now,
you're giving me advice?

659
00:53:48,024 --> 00:53:50,049
- I won't let this happen to my daughter.
- What's going on?

660
00:53:50,126 --> 00:53:52,321
- Go to your room.
- You're not my mother.

661
00:53:52,395 --> 00:53:54,329
Get out of here, Tiny.

662
00:53:54,397 --> 00:53:56,388
I said get out of here!

663
00:53:58,301 --> 00:54:00,769
Don't you fucking touch him.

664
00:54:00,837 --> 00:54:02,771
You think Mom would give me
the same wise advise?

665
00:54:02,839 --> 00:54:03,999
That's it.

666
00:54:04,074 --> 00:54:06,872
Give me back what you took, and if I
catch you with this <i>pendajo</i> again...

667
00:54:06,943 --> 00:54:09,503
You'll what? Fucking kill me?

668
00:54:19,856 --> 00:54:21,847
That was fast.

669
00:54:21,925 --> 00:54:23,119
I ran.

670
00:54:23,193 --> 00:54:25,127
I can see that.

671
00:54:30,166 --> 00:54:32,532
My parents are light sleepers.

672
00:54:52,889 --> 00:54:54,823
So what happened?

673
00:55:06,036 --> 00:55:08,300
You think
I could stay here tonight?

674
00:55:09,539 --> 00:55:11,734
Yeah.

675
00:55:11,808 --> 00:55:13,742
But no monkey business.

676
00:55:15,812 --> 00:55:18,576
I thought all guys
jumped at this chance.

677
00:55:21,151 --> 00:55:23,745
I guess I'm not prime trim, huh?

678
00:55:30,093 --> 00:55:32,323
How'd you get so fucking crude?

679
00:55:32,395 --> 00:55:34,659
How'd you get so fucking polite?

680
00:55:34,731 --> 00:55:36,164
Shut up.

681
00:56:17,874 --> 00:56:19,808
So you're serious?

682
00:56:21,211 --> 00:56:24,305
Cal tod me to keep a lid on it
until I fight Ray.

683
00:56:28,118 --> 00:56:30,052
You two are gonna go at it?

684
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:33,055
It's just a preliminary.
Amateur stuff.

685
00:56:38,628 --> 00:56:42,496
So that "no sex" shit
is for real?

686
00:56:42,565 --> 00:56:43,691
It's for real.

687
00:56:47,470 --> 00:56:49,404
Let's sleep.

688
00:56:49,472 --> 00:56:50,905
Yeah, yeah.

689
00:57:08,758 --> 00:57:11,192
Are your parents still together?

690
00:57:14,264 --> 00:57:16,255
Not really.

691
00:57:16,332 --> 00:57:19,028
My mom died a long time ago.

692
00:57:26,042 --> 00:57:28,374
So what happened,
if you don't mind?

693
00:57:31,915 --> 00:57:33,849
She killed herself.

694
00:57:39,289 --> 00:57:41,314
Man.

695
00:57:41,391 --> 00:57:42,881
I'm sorry.

696
00:57:45,528 --> 00:57:46,961
Yeah.

697
00:57:49,065 --> 00:57:50,498
Me too.

698
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:19,754
Dream of me knocking Ray out
in the third round.

699
00:58:22,832 --> 00:58:24,424
I already have.

700
00:58:51,861 --> 00:58:54,159
What?

701
00:58:54,230 --> 00:58:56,164
Can I come in?

702
00:58:57,233 --> 00:58:58,825
Yeah.

703
00:59:09,178 --> 00:59:11,112
I hear it's true,
you got a lover.

704
00:59:11,180 --> 00:59:12,613
Oh, man.

705
00:59:12,682 --> 00:59:14,912
First comes love,
then comes marriage.

706
00:59:17,287 --> 00:59:18,481
Sensitive.

707
00:59:19,289 --> 00:59:20,881
It's not funny.

708
00:59:25,161 --> 00:59:27,095
Look, I don't know how
you pay Hector...

709
00:59:27,163 --> 00:59:29,324
and I don't think I wanna know.

710
00:59:29,399 --> 00:59:33,028
But Dad's wasting his money
on me and, well...

711
00:59:33,102 --> 00:59:35,593
he won't know
if you use it instead.

712
00:59:37,073 --> 00:59:39,769
What are you gonna be doing when
you're supposed to be at the gym?

713
00:59:39,842 --> 00:59:41,571
I'm a geek.

714
00:59:41,644 --> 00:59:44,204
I'll do something
constructive with my time.

715
00:59:48,117 --> 00:59:49,448
Thanks.

716
01:00:03,433 --> 01:00:06,732
Hi. You must be the new boxer.
I'm Candice.

717
01:00:08,638 --> 01:00:10,629
Not bad for an old fart.

718
01:00:13,476 --> 01:00:16,206
- How are you doing? Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

719
01:00:16,279 --> 01:00:18,645
I was just talking about you.

720
01:00:18,715 --> 01:00:20,774
I've come to defend myself.

721
01:00:20,850 --> 01:00:26,288
Hey, remember when I told you
that girls can't be boxers?

722
01:00:26,356 --> 01:00:27,880
Yeah, I remember.

723
01:00:27,957 --> 01:00:30,585
Girls... Excuse me...

724
01:00:30,660 --> 01:00:34,790
Women have a lower center
of gravity.

725
01:00:34,864 --> 01:00:37,731
Maybe they're more grounded
once they build strength.

726
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:40,360
It makes 'em
a different kind of boxer.

727
01:00:40,436 --> 01:00:44,270
- Are you serious?
- It's just a theory.

728
01:00:44,340 --> 01:00:46,934
The way to prove it is
to get more women in that ring.

729
01:00:48,011 --> 01:00:50,002
One-twenty-six.

730
01:00:50,079 --> 01:00:52,946
Must be all that muscle
you're building.

731
01:00:53,016 --> 01:00:56,179
- What division?
- You're a featherweight.

732
01:00:59,489 --> 01:01:01,923
- You're not mingling.
- Huh?

733
01:01:02,792 --> 01:01:06,523
This is a party.
You should be dancin'.

734
01:01:07,430 --> 01:01:11,127
- I'm not much of a dancer.
- Sure you are.

735
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:14,499
I mean, you dance, right?

736
01:01:14,570 --> 01:01:18,370
- Hector says my footwork gets sloppy.
- Looks okay to me.

737
01:01:18,441 --> 01:01:20,306
Let's box. Come on.

738
01:01:20,376 --> 01:01:22,970
No, bro, not in Hector's kitchen.

739
01:01:23,046 --> 01:01:27,073
But you're all serious and shit.
Come on. Be a man.

740
01:01:29,986 --> 01:01:32,045
You know...

741
01:01:32,121 --> 01:01:34,715
they say love
kills you in the ring.

742
01:02:34,517 --> 01:02:36,951
Hector, I gotta go.

743
01:02:37,019 --> 01:02:40,921
But you just got here.
Sure you can't stay longer?

744
01:02:40,990 --> 01:02:42,651
No.

745
01:02:55,171 --> 01:02:57,605
It was better with the ice cream.

746
01:03:00,109 --> 01:03:01,872
How you feel?

747
01:03:01,944 --> 01:03:03,309
Tired.

748
01:03:14,557 --> 01:03:16,582
This is a waste of time.

749
01:03:16,659 --> 01:03:19,492
Look, Adrian's got a bout coming up.
I don't mean to insult you...

750
01:03:19,562 --> 01:03:22,998
What's the big deal? There's no one near
Adrian's weight to spar with today.

751
01:03:23,065 --> 01:03:25,431
Might as well give my gal a chance.

752
01:03:25,501 --> 01:03:27,492
I don't like it, Hector.

753
01:03:27,570 --> 01:03:30,505
Tell him to think of her
as a warm-up.

754
01:03:36,913 --> 01:03:40,076
This equality crap
has gone too far.

755
01:03:40,149 --> 01:03:43,209
- Should we just forget about it?
- No.

756
01:03:43,286 --> 01:03:47,916
Just get rough on her in the first round
and Hector will stop it real early.

757
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:52,450
Go ahead.

758
01:04:11,781 --> 01:04:13,271
Come on.
What'd I tell you?

759
01:04:14,183 --> 01:04:15,616
Hit me!

760
01:04:23,492 --> 01:04:24,789
Hit me already.

761
01:04:32,168 --> 01:04:35,831
I'm not gonna fight him
if he doesn't hit me.

762
01:04:35,905 --> 01:04:38,840
Both of you, enough bullshit!
Now box!

763
01:04:55,024 --> 01:04:56,082
You okay?

764
01:04:56,158 --> 01:04:58,422
Stay inside.

765
01:05:03,332 --> 01:05:04,856
I love you.

766
01:05:08,371 --> 01:05:09,963
I really do.

767
01:05:29,825 --> 01:05:31,417
Come on.

768
01:05:34,530 --> 01:05:37,226
I'm not running after you,
if that's what you want.

769
01:05:54,550 --> 01:05:57,144
<i>'A gender-blind amateur</i>
<i>boxing proposal...</i>

770
01:05:57,219 --> 01:06:01,178

771
01:06:01,257 --> 01:06:03,623
<i>for officially sanctioned</i>

775
01:06:19,141 --> 01:06:21,609
Now that they're mixing up
the guys with the girls...

776
01:06:21,677 --> 01:06:23,770
you could have
a lot more opponents.

777
01:06:25,181 --> 01:06:28,048
They got you fighting this girl
from Buffalo next week.

778
01:06:28,117 --> 01:06:30,745
And you can have a fight
every week if you want.

779
01:06:52,441 --> 01:06:54,375
Hey, Vince.
Long time no see.

780
01:07:09,458 --> 01:07:11,392
Let me get this straight.

781
01:07:11,460 --> 01:07:15,328
She's had three amateur matches
and she's already turning pro?

782
01:07:15,398 --> 01:07:17,593
That's a little premature,
don't you think?

783
01:07:17,666 --> 01:07:21,534
- Damn it!
- Trainer says kid's got a high fever.

784
01:07:21,604 --> 01:07:23,663
Dead on his feet
with strep throat.

785
01:07:23,739 --> 01:07:26,003
I'd fight that yellow kid
with one arm.

786
01:07:28,377 --> 01:07:33,679
Missy from Buffalo's 33 years old
and she can make some money as a pro.

787
01:07:33,749 --> 01:07:35,239
The fight's totally called off?

788
01:07:35,317 --> 01:07:39,481
Why bother with small-fry stuff
when she can be on TV?

789
01:07:39,555 --> 01:07:41,921
Calm down.
There'll be other matches.

790
01:07:41,991 --> 01:07:43,618
Not soon enough.

791
01:07:46,395 --> 01:07:50,491
It's a pathetic turnout, but I've gotta
give these people their $10 worth.

792
01:07:50,566 --> 01:07:53,034
And half of my fighters
haven't showed up.

793
01:07:53,102 --> 01:07:55,969
Come on, Ira.
Let's just see this thing in action.

794
01:07:56,038 --> 01:07:58,063
All right.

795
01:07:58,140 --> 01:08:01,871
If it turns ugly,
you can't say I didn't warn you.

796
01:08:02,611 --> 01:08:04,875
- Nervous?
- No.

797
01:08:04,947 --> 01:08:08,508
All right. Remember,
you're judged on points.

798
01:08:08,584 --> 01:08:11,610
Be aggressive and make legal punches.

799
01:08:13,923 --> 01:08:16,255
- Nervous?
- No.

800
01:08:16,625 --> 01:08:18,718
<i>Welcome to Brooklyn A. C...</i>

801
01:08:18,794 --> 01:08:22,230

01:08:41,884 --> 01:08:44,648
<i>from Brooklyn, 19 years old...</i>

807
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:46,847

<i>Both of these boxers'</i>

01:08:55,664 --> 01:08:58,155

811

<i>Let's give a big hand</i>

812
01:09:08,611 --> 01:09:11,478
You know the rules.
Let's keep it above the belt.

813
01:09:11,547 --> 01:09:14,607
Fight a fair fight and good luck.
Touch up.

814
01:09:20,189 --> 01:09:23,056
Stay loose and relaxed, okay?

815
01:09:29,798 --> 01:09:30,924
Box!

816
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:32,627
Okay, off you go.

817
01:09:37,239 --> 01:09:39,639
Come on, Diana.

818
01:10:00,129 --> 01:10:01,619
Stop!

819
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:08,429
Good.
You're doing good. Relax.

820
01:10:08,504 --> 01:10:12,600
Hey, Sandro. How you been doing?
I haven't seen you in a while.

821
01:10:12,675 --> 01:10:15,508
Keep your head on.
She's getting a lot of good punches.

822
01:10:15,578 --> 01:10:17,842
At least he's predictable.

823
01:10:19,215 --> 01:10:21,911
And what's with all
the wild swinging bullshit?

824
01:10:23,385 --> 01:10:25,250
He really wants to kill me.

825
01:10:25,321 --> 01:10:30,349
Okay, he's lunging at you thinking
you're gonna back away from him.

826
01:10:30,426 --> 01:10:32,656
Use that to throw your body shots.

827
01:10:34,797 --> 01:10:36,321
Stay with him. Hey!

828
01:10:36,398 --> 01:10:39,026
You gotta box more, okay?

829
01:10:40,569 --> 01:10:42,764
Are you listening to me?

830
01:10:42,838 --> 01:10:44,806
Stay inside of him...

831
01:10:44,873 --> 01:10:47,103
boom, shoot an uppercut.

832
01:10:48,577 --> 01:10:50,511
I'll try.

833
01:10:50,579 --> 01:10:52,171
Box!

834
01:10:53,949 --> 01:10:56,247
All right, come on, Diana.

835
01:10:59,121 --> 01:11:01,055
Yeah, Diana, come on.
Come on!

836
01:11:14,470 --> 01:11:15,528
Break!

837
01:11:22,978 --> 01:11:25,310
Stop!

838
01:11:27,483 --> 01:11:30,043
One, two...

839
01:11:30,119 --> 01:11:33,350
three, four...

840
01:11:33,422 --> 01:11:36,755
five, six...

841
01:11:36,825 --> 01:11:39,487
seven, eight...

842
01:11:39,561 --> 01:11:41,756
You okay? Box!

843
01:11:41,830 --> 01:11:45,823
- You don't have it in you.
- Stop! No talking. Box!

844
01:11:47,703 --> 01:11:49,034
Stop!

845
01:11:49,104 --> 01:11:51,334
I don't have the stomach for this.

846
01:11:55,311 --> 01:11:57,939
What the hell are you doing, huh?

847
01:11:58,013 --> 01:12:00,004
Don't let him bully you like that.

848
01:12:01,116 --> 01:12:03,744
You are a better fighter than Ray.

849
01:12:03,819 --> 01:12:05,411
Come on!

850
01:12:07,356 --> 01:12:08,948
Box.

851
01:12:14,296 --> 01:12:15,854
Stop!

852
01:12:17,466 --> 01:12:20,367
That's below the belt.
This is a warning. Box.

853
01:12:24,206 --> 01:12:25,571
Stop!

854
01:12:25,641 --> 01:12:28,201
- What a prick.
- He can't do that, right?

855
01:12:28,277 --> 01:12:31,769
Last warning. One more time,
you're disqualified. Box.

856
01:12:31,847 --> 01:12:35,112
What's below the belt anyway?
Ain't nothing but a pussy!

857
01:12:35,184 --> 01:12:39,314
- Yeah, I wish I had thought of that.
- Fucking asshole.

858
01:12:39,388 --> 01:12:41,253
What are you doing?

859
01:12:41,323 --> 01:12:43,416
Hey, I gotta warn you too.

860
01:12:43,492 --> 01:12:45,653
I'll say it one last time.

861
01:12:45,728 --> 01:12:48,561
- No pushing.
- Catch you next time.

862
01:12:48,630 --> 01:12:50,393
Box!

863
01:12:51,700 --> 01:12:53,964
Stop! That's it, Cortez.
It's over.

864
01:12:54,737 --> 01:12:56,136
Get out of the ring.

865
01:12:59,375 --> 01:13:01,434
The match is over.

866
01:13:01,510 --> 01:13:03,740
I've had it with you, kid.

01:13:43,218 --> 01:13:45,743
All this sneaking around,
and for what?

873
01:13:47,256 --> 01:13:50,453
To get the shit beaten out of you,
that's what.

874
01:13:51,393 --> 01:13:53,156
Thanks a lot, Dad.

875
01:13:53,228 --> 01:13:56,095
But you know,
it was almost like entertainment.

876
01:13:56,165 --> 01:13:59,965
Hey, I won tonight.
You hear me?

877
01:14:00,035 --> 01:14:03,027
I won.
What do you think about that?

878
01:14:03,105 --> 01:14:05,300
I think you're ridiculous.

879
01:14:05,374 --> 01:14:08,502
You're nothing but a street fighter.
You looked like a loser in there.

880
01:14:08,577 --> 01:14:12,445
Everything I know about losing
I learned from you, Dad.

881
01:14:12,514 --> 01:14:15,005
- I'm your father.
- Yeah, some father you are.

882
01:14:15,083 --> 01:14:17,745
The only thing you had the heart to love
you practically beat into a grave.

883
01:14:17,820 --> 01:14:20,482
- Shut up with that.
- You just had to push her, didn't you?

884
01:14:20,556 --> 01:14:21,682
I mean it!

885
01:14:21,757 --> 01:14:24,590
Until she'd rather die
than answer to you, huh?

886
01:14:24,660 --> 01:14:26,753
I said shut up with that!

887
01:14:39,975 --> 01:14:42,341
I could snap your neck right now
if I felt like it.

888
01:14:42,411 --> 01:14:46,108
- I could kill you if I felt like it.
- No, no, no. Please.

889
01:14:46,181 --> 01:14:49,048
Mom begged.
Did you stop when she said please?

890
01:14:49,117 --> 01:14:50,744
- I can't remember.
- Diana, stop it!

891
01:14:50,819 --> 01:14:52,548
You belong to me now.

892
01:14:52,621 --> 01:14:55,454
How does it feel to see
so much of yourself so close?

893
01:14:55,524 --> 01:14:57,617
- How does it feel?
- Diana, stop!

894
01:14:57,693 --> 01:14:59,684
Please, Diana, stop.

895
01:15:00,562 --> 01:15:02,154
Just stop.

896
01:15:33,262 --> 01:15:37,289
All these years,
you just looked right through me.

897
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:07,656
Look what the cat dragged in.

898
01:16:20,008 --> 01:16:23,535
- Who are they?
- Those are Hector's kids.

899
01:16:26,615 --> 01:16:28,708
He doesn't see them too often.

900
01:16:49,938 --> 01:16:51,166
Never mind.

901
01:16:53,041 --> 01:16:55,009
Who was that?

902
01:16:55,077 --> 01:16:57,875
Nobody. Quit it.

903
01:17:02,017 --> 01:17:04,110
- Oh, please.
- No, I'm serious.

904
01:17:04,186 --> 01:17:06,711
This athletic shit makes you,
like, a class achiever.

905
01:17:06,788 --> 01:17:09,348
- You think so?
- Yeah.

906
01:17:09,424 --> 01:17:12,655
Well, now that I got
school all covered...

907
01:17:12,728 --> 01:17:15,959
I only have the world
outside of these walls to fuck up.

908
01:17:16,031 --> 01:17:18,124
Damn, girl, that's grim.

909
01:17:18,200 --> 01:17:19,792
It's the truth.

910
01:17:24,139 --> 01:17:27,472
- Holy shit.
- What?

911
01:17:27,542 --> 01:17:30,909
Ex-hundred percent man
is to your left.

912
01:17:35,250 --> 01:17:37,844
Stop being so obvious.
Damn, girl.

913
01:17:37,919 --> 01:17:41,912
- That's him with the forearms?
- Yeah.

914
01:17:41,990 --> 01:17:44,788
Well, if he's such an ex,
what's he doing here?

915
01:17:44,860 --> 01:17:49,661
I don't know. Maybe he's
a glutton for punishment or something.

916
01:17:49,731 --> 01:17:51,722
A glutton for punishment, <i>loca?</i>

917
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:54,268
- Yeah.
- Shit, you better go over there.

918
01:18:12,654 --> 01:18:14,588
I heard you fought Ray.

919
01:18:15,991 --> 01:18:18,459
You're right.
He's a fucking case.

920
01:18:26,334 --> 01:18:29,497
I feel pretty fucking stupid out here,
waiting for school to be let out.

921
01:18:29,571 --> 01:18:31,163
Then don't.

922
01:18:33,008 --> 01:18:34,600
Right.

923
01:18:38,780 --> 01:18:42,944
So, where's your woman when
she doesn't have her tongue in your ear?

924
01:18:43,018 --> 01:18:46,249
Or do you only bring her out
for special occasions?

925
01:18:51,927 --> 01:18:54,191
I came here to say I'm sorry.

926
01:18:54,262 --> 01:18:56,321
Sorry for what, Adrian?

927
01:18:58,033 --> 01:19:01,935
Proving to your friends
you can still snag the pretty girl?

928
01:19:02,003 --> 01:19:05,131
You got yourself
a fuckin' trophy now.

929
01:19:05,207 --> 01:19:07,402
Bet it makes you feel
real big inside, huh?

930
01:19:07,476 --> 01:19:09,944
I don't feel too big right now.

931
01:19:10,011 --> 01:19:12,809
As a matter of fact,
I feel pretty fucking small around you.

932
01:19:12,881 --> 01:19:14,781
Must be nice.

933
01:19:14,850 --> 01:19:16,784
Yeah, well, it's not.

934
01:19:19,387 --> 01:19:22,254
You and me,
we just met each other, right?

935
01:19:22,324 --> 01:19:23,985
We barely know each other.

936
01:19:24,059 --> 01:19:26,425
No problem.

937
01:19:26,495 --> 01:19:28,087
So, then leave.

938
01:19:31,533 --> 01:19:34,730
- Maybe I don't wanna leave.
- Why?

939
01:19:34,803 --> 01:19:37,897
You're off the hook now,
free to do whatever.

940
01:19:37,973 --> 01:19:40,407
That's not all
I wanted to say.

941
01:19:43,745 --> 01:19:46,179
I told Karina it wasn't
gonna work out with her.

942
01:19:47,816 --> 01:19:49,750
I told her
I finally met somebody that...

943
01:19:49,818 --> 01:19:52,309
makes something happen for me.

944
01:19:55,157 --> 01:19:59,150
Just 'cause it's true doesn't mean
I know what to do about it, okay?

945
01:20:01,096 --> 01:20:03,826
You got anything to say to that?

946
01:20:09,738 --> 01:20:11,899
So I'm someone, huh?

947
01:20:15,710 --> 01:20:17,735
Yeah, you are.

948
01:20:44,339 --> 01:20:45,931
I was wrong.

949
01:20:46,007 --> 01:20:48,032
There's more than
one of you out there.

950
01:20:48,109 --> 01:20:50,441
And I hear she's good.

951
01:20:50,512 --> 01:20:54,608
She's a southpaw, and she's won
most of her matches 'cause of it.

952
01:20:58,220 --> 01:21:00,814
<i>These next couple of weeks</i>
<i>I'm gonna train you so hard...</i>

953
01:21:00,889 --> 01:21:03,380
<i>you'll be wired like a machine.</i>

954
01:21:04,559 --> 01:21:07,119
<i>There's all kinds</i>
<i>of fighters out there.</i>

955
01:21:08,330 --> 01:21:11,128
<i>The more versatile you are,</i>
<i>the better prepared you are.</i>

956
01:21:14,469 --> 01:21:16,903
<i>You gotta learn how to manage your</i>
<i>power, 'cause you got more of it...</i>

957
01:21:16,972 --> 01:21:19,406
<i>than people realize.</i>

958
01:21:19,474 --> 01:21:21,499
<i>How you gonna do that?</i>

959
01:21:23,778 --> 01:21:26,303
<i>First, you're gonna</i>
<i>strengthen yourjab.</i>

960
01:21:35,390 --> 01:21:39,156
Feels funny, right?
Southpaw now.

961
01:21:39,227 --> 01:21:41,923
Okay? I'm Ricky.
I'm Ricky.

962
01:21:41,997 --> 01:21:43,897
Come on. Good.

963
01:21:43,965 --> 01:21:45,557
Jab, jab.

964
01:21:50,672 --> 01:21:52,606
Very nice.
Very clever.

965
01:22:02,851 --> 01:22:05,820
Girls, I want a good, clean fight.

966
01:22:05,887 --> 01:22:09,789
It's my decision if one of you
needs a standing eight count.

967
01:22:09,858 --> 01:22:13,658
If you score a knockdown,
go to the farthest neutral corner...

968
01:22:13,728 --> 01:22:15,218
and stay there.

969
01:22:15,297 --> 01:22:18,630
Don't come out until
I tell you to resume fighting.

970
01:22:18,700 --> 01:22:21,328
Got it? Let's go.

971
01:22:28,910 --> 01:22:31,845
The key to this
is not losing your cool.

972
01:23:28,870 --> 01:23:32,567
The judges are gonna give that to Stiles
'cause they see her hands moving.

973
01:23:32,640 --> 01:23:34,631
Remind them you're in there with her.

974
01:24:11,746 --> 01:24:14,112
That was nice.

975
01:24:21,056 --> 01:24:24,025
Okay, your punches are making contact.
Your defense is strong.

976
01:24:24,092 --> 01:24:26,026
But you gotta stagger her.

977
01:24:26,094 --> 01:24:30,554
These judges won't give you any points
if they can't see you slowing her down.

978
01:25:15,143 --> 01:25:17,509
Stop.

979
01:25:17,579 --> 01:25:21,606
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>we have a split decision.</i>

980
01:25:21,683 --> 01:25:25,915
<i>Hill judges 29-27 for Guzman.</i>

981
01:25:25,987 --> 01:25:30,356
<i>Ferrara judges 29-27 for Stiles.</i>

982
01:25:30,425 --> 01:25:35,158
<i>Anderson judges 28-27 for Guzman.</i>

983
01:25:35,230 --> 01:25:38,199
<i>And the bout goes to Guzman.</i>

984
01:25:56,551 --> 01:25:59,042
<i>Based on the results</i>
<i>of the preliminary matches...</i>

985
01:25:59,120 --> 01:26:01,816
you've been advanced
to the finals.

986
01:26:02,957 --> 01:26:05,585
Even though the first fight
was stopped?

987
01:26:05,660 --> 01:26:07,423
Yep.

988
01:26:07,495 --> 01:26:10,794
You scored better than
a lot of the kids in your division.

989
01:26:10,865 --> 01:26:14,631
That's great.
So, uh, who's next?

990
01:26:17,005 --> 01:26:19,974
Come on, Cal.
You saw her with Stiles.

991
01:26:20,041 --> 01:26:23,238
- What's going on here?
- I'll tell you what.

992
01:26:23,311 --> 01:26:26,838
This rinky-dink operation...
excuse my candor, Ira...

993
01:26:26,915 --> 01:26:30,749
let this goddamn gender-blind program
get out of hand.

994
01:26:30,818 --> 01:26:32,718
You signed him up for it.

995
01:26:32,787 --> 01:26:34,880
Boys are different from girls.

996
01:26:34,956 --> 01:26:36,981
What's so wrong about
saying it out loud?

997
01:26:37,058 --> 01:26:39,322
Boys are different from girls.

998
01:26:39,394 --> 01:26:44,229
No girl has what it takes to be a boxer.
Neither do most boys.

999
01:26:44,299 --> 01:26:46,392
I'm gonna petition the fight.

1000
01:26:46,467 --> 01:26:48,765
Oh, come on,
you're the one always complaining...

1001
01:26:48,836 --> 01:26:50,804
you can't get enough matches
for your guys.

1002
01:26:50,872 --> 01:26:53,136
Adrian's young.
He works hard.

1003
01:26:53,208 --> 01:26:55,403
He's a good-looking kid.

1004
01:26:55,476 --> 01:26:58,468
Ayear from now I want him
grooming for the pros.

1005
01:26:58,546 --> 01:27:00,138
Then you're pushing him.

1006
01:27:00,215 --> 01:27:03,184
You can't humiliate
my guy like this!

1007
01:27:04,652 --> 01:27:06,620
Ira, I need your support.

1008
01:27:07,789 --> 01:27:10,952
File your protest,
but don't ask me to get involved.

1009
01:27:11,025 --> 01:27:12,959
I will say this.

1010
01:27:13,027 --> 01:27:16,622
Let the boxers box,
and that'll speak for itself.

1011
01:27:17,665 --> 01:27:19,690
Unbelievable.

1012
01:27:26,774 --> 01:27:29,937
Hector, if this happens...

1013
01:27:30,011 --> 01:27:32,241
I'm telling Adrian no mercy.

1014
01:27:32,313 --> 01:27:33,803
You understand?

1015
01:27:33,881 --> 01:27:36,509
Yeah. So will she.

1016
01:27:49,797 --> 01:27:52,061
This is crazy.

1017
01:27:52,133 --> 01:27:54,533
And Cal's right.
This fucks with my record.

1018
01:27:54,602 --> 01:27:56,661
It's your amateur record.

1019
01:27:56,738 --> 01:28:00,731
At least we got the same disadvantage:
We know each other's habits.

1020
01:28:00,808 --> 01:28:02,833
Fuck!

1021
01:28:02,910 --> 01:28:07,074
Come on. Stiles makes fights, right?
You said it yourself.

1022
01:28:08,416 --> 01:28:10,145
You have lost your mind.

1023
01:28:12,086 --> 01:28:14,179
I got it.
I won't make my weight.

1024
01:28:14,255 --> 01:28:17,554
- What?
- I'll eat for a fucking change.

1025
01:28:19,127 --> 01:28:21,061
I won't fight you,
and that's it.

1026
01:28:21,129 --> 01:28:24,257
- Who says you're the only one fighting?
- I'm sorry, Diana.

1027
01:28:24,332 --> 01:28:27,824
I haven't trained all this time
to be stuck in a ring with a girl.

1028
01:28:27,902 --> 01:28:31,702
- Stuck with a girl.
- Okay.

1029
01:28:31,773 --> 01:28:33,570
Stuck with you.

1030
01:28:35,810 --> 01:28:37,744
- You're afraid I might win.
- No.

1031
01:28:38,713 --> 01:28:41,546
You're gonna play it
all manly and protective on me now.

1032
01:28:41,616 --> 01:28:43,811
Look, I'm just being honest.

1033
01:28:43,885 --> 01:28:46,046
- You're just like any other guy.
- Oh, yeah?

1034
01:28:46,120 --> 01:28:48,281
What kind of a guy goes around
beating up a girl that...

1035
01:28:48,356 --> 01:28:50,290
That he what?

1036
01:28:52,493 --> 01:28:53,892
What?

1037
01:28:55,530 --> 01:28:58,363
Just forget it.
It's not right.

1038
01:28:58,433 --> 01:29:00,492
Fine. All I know...

1039
01:29:00,568 --> 01:29:02,695
is if you don't fight me
in this match...

1040
01:29:02,770 --> 01:29:04,795
you're less of a man
than you think you are.

1041
01:29:04,872 --> 01:29:07,500
What is it that
you want from me anyway?

1042
01:29:07,575 --> 01:29:10,043
You want me to take you
a little more seriously, huh?

1043
01:29:10,111 --> 01:29:12,045
Is that what you want?

1044
01:29:13,114 --> 01:29:15,173
Is that your idea
of Prince Charming?

1045
01:29:15,249 --> 01:29:18,082
You need to take yourself
a little more seriously.

1046
01:29:18,152 --> 01:29:20,882
Who's the one who said
it was all about the challenge?

1047
01:29:20,955 --> 01:29:22,946
Who's the one who said
that they love to win?

1048
01:29:23,024 --> 01:29:26,084
Well, I'm not gonna love
winning this one.

1049
01:29:26,160 --> 01:29:28,094
Then maybe you shouldn't
be a boxer.

1050
01:29:40,174 --> 01:29:44,907
<i>Oh, say can you see</i>

1051
01:29:44,979 --> 01:29:49,678
<i>By the dawn's early light</i>

1052
01:29:49,751 --> 01:29:54,347
<i>What so proudly we hailed</i>

1053
01:29:54,422 --> 01:29:59,359
<i>At the twilight's last gleaming</i>

1054
01:29:59,427 --> 01:30:04,126
<i>Whose broad stripes and bright stars</i>

1055
01:30:04,198 --> 01:30:08,726
<i>Through the perilous fight</i>

1056
01:30:08,803 --> 01:30:13,763
<i>O'er the ramparts we watched</i>

1057
01:30:13,841 --> 01:30:17,834
<i>Were so gallantly streaming</i>

1058
01:30:17,912 --> 01:30:22,281
<i>And the rockets'red glare</i>

1059
01:30:22,350 --> 01:30:26,787
<i>The bombs bursting in air</i>

1060
01:30:28,856 --> 01:30:31,222
Oh, I'm sorry.
This seat is saved for someone.

1061
01:30:31,292 --> 01:30:34,455
<i>That our flag was still there</i>

1062
01:30:34,529 --> 01:30:36,463
You know what? Forget it.
They're not coming.

1063
01:30:36,531 --> 01:30:40,627
<i>Oh, say does that star-spangled</i>

1064
01:30:40,701 --> 01:30:45,536
- The card says Diana Guzman. Look.
- Must be a misprint.

1065
01:30:45,606 --> 01:30:47,597
It doesn't look like
a misprint to me.

1066
01:30:47,675 --> 01:30:50,143
<i>O'er the land of the free</i>

1067
01:30:50,211 --> 01:30:53,180
<i>And the home</i>

1068
01:30:53,247 --> 01:30:56,148
<i>Of the brave</i>

1069
01:30:59,854 --> 01:31:02,186
How you feeling?

1070
01:31:02,256 --> 01:31:04,486
Like I got nothing to lose.

1071
01:31:04,559 --> 01:31:06,151
Good, then.

1072
01:31:07,662 --> 01:31:10,028
Inside, you know him?

1073
01:31:13,968 --> 01:31:16,095
- Yeah.
- How's he fight?

1074
01:31:17,605 --> 01:31:21,439
He's always stepping left.
He relies on his right for power.

1075
01:31:21,509 --> 01:31:25,275
He jabs low,
and his right cross can knock me out.

1076
01:31:28,616 --> 01:31:32,416
Inside, you know yourself?

1077
01:31:39,894 --> 01:31:42,089
Yeah, I do.

1078
01:31:45,700 --> 01:31:48,225
Then that's all you need.

1079
01:31:50,137 --> 01:31:51,539
<i>Welcome, ladies and gentlemen...</i>

1080
01:31:51,539 --> 01:31:53,063
<i>Welcome, ladies and gentlemen...</i>

1081
01:31:53,140 --> 01:31:55,199
<i>to history in the making.</i>

1082
01:31:55,276 --> 01:32:00,873
<i>New York's first gender-blind</i>
<i>amateur boxing finals.</i>

1083
01:32:06,354 --> 01:32:07,878
<i>In the gold shorts...</i>

1084
01:32:07,955 --> 01:32:10,651
<i>weighing in at 125 pounds</i>...

1085
01:32:10,725 --> 01:32:15,424
Lead him with your jab.
Keep moving to your left.

1086
01:32:15,496 --> 01:32:17,430
Force him to come to you.

1087
01:32:24,205 --> 01:32:26,833
<i>And in the lovely purple shorts</i>...

1088
01:32:28,342 --> 01:32:31,778
- I can't go through with this, Cal.
- Yes, you can.

1089
01:32:31,846 --> 01:32:35,179
Just do some damage in this round
and it will be short and sweet.

1090
01:32:35,249 --> 01:32:37,809
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>clap your hands for...</i>

1091
01:32:37,885 --> 01:32:40,877
<i>Diana Guzman.</i>

1092
01:32:59,907 --> 01:33:01,499
Box!

1093
01:33:40,214 --> 01:33:42,546
Pick up the pace, okay?

1094
01:33:42,617 --> 01:33:46,553
- You're doing good by leading him.
- I got to get to his body more.

1095
01:33:46,621 --> 01:33:49,886
So she's got some defensive skills.
So what?

1096
01:33:49,957 --> 01:33:51,891
Take her out and finish her.

1097
01:33:54,629 --> 01:33:56,995
Give me.

1098
01:33:57,064 --> 01:33:58,656
Box!

1099
01:34:43,611 --> 01:34:47,547
His jabs are getting low and his swings
are wild. That leaves him open.

1100
01:34:47,615 --> 01:34:50,914
Work your way inside and go for
his brain every chance you get.

1101
01:34:53,320 --> 01:34:55,311
I don't care who this guy is to you.

1102
01:34:55,389 --> 01:34:57,755
Don't be afraid to hurt him.

1103
01:36:30,885 --> 01:36:32,682
Get up, get up, get up!

1104
01:37:52,032 --> 01:37:54,592
Boxers, center of the ring, please.

1105
01:38:04,044 --> 01:38:05,409
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

1106
01:38:05,479 --> 01:38:08,346
<i>we have a unanimous decision.</i>

1107
01:38:08,415 --> 01:38:12,909
<i>The amateur featherweight champ</i>
<i>in these finals is...</i>

1108
01:38:12,987 --> 01:38:14,921
<i>Diana Guzman!</i>

1109
01:38:14,989 --> 01:38:17,457
Yeah!

1110
01:38:27,935 --> 01:38:30,529
Satisfied?

1111
01:38:46,320 --> 01:38:49,483
In all my life,
I never been so proud.

1112
01:38:49,556 --> 01:38:51,148
Never.

1113
01:38:55,429 --> 01:38:57,021
Let's go.

1114
01:42:21,468 --> 01:42:23,959
You got a deadly hook.

1115
01:42:28,809 --> 01:42:30,743
Someone really worked you over.

1116
01:42:32,146 --> 01:42:34,410
Your right cross
is no powder puff.

1117
01:42:43,790 --> 01:42:45,724
I gave you everything I had.

1118
01:42:47,427 --> 01:42:50,055
Me too.

1119
01:42:56,737 --> 01:42:59,672
Boxing, going pro...

1120
01:43:03,343 --> 01:43:05,937
I want it to be my ticket out.

1121
01:43:08,248 --> 01:43:11,308
But I gave you an opening.
It was stupid.

1122
01:43:11,385 --> 01:43:14,013
But that's what happens.

1123
01:43:14,087 --> 01:43:16,021
You just take advantage.

1124
01:43:17,491 --> 01:43:19,083
Yeah.

1125
01:43:21,595 --> 01:43:23,995
So, now I lose your respect, huh?

1126
01:43:24,064 --> 01:43:26,328
No.

1127
01:43:27,968 --> 01:43:30,459
After the other night?
Come on.

1128
01:43:34,208 --> 01:43:38,668
You boxed with me
like I was any other guy.

1129
01:43:42,216 --> 01:43:44,980
You threw down
and you showed me respect.

1130
01:43:46,320 --> 01:43:48,720
Don't you see what that means?

1131
01:43:50,424 --> 01:43:53,188
That life with you is war.

1132
01:43:54,728 --> 01:43:56,320
Maybe.

1133
01:43:58,232 --> 01:44:00,826
Maybe life's just war, period.

1134
01:44:04,137 --> 01:44:05,729
You said it.

1135
01:44:14,715 --> 01:44:17,650
My life's been a mess
since I met you.

1136
01:44:28,095 --> 01:44:30,359
So, you gonna dump me now?

1137
01:44:33,967 --> 01:44:35,559
Probably.

1138
01:44:39,439 --> 01:44:41,031
Promise?

1139
01:44:46,395 --> 01:45:16,395
