-Your shot.
-[Harry] ...here's a food 
market

174
00:12:51,425 --> 00:12:53,220
-where people in this...
-You take it for me, will you?

175
00:12:54,049 --> 00:12:55,395
I wanna watch this.

176
00:12:55,533 --> 00:12:57,121
[Harry] ...buildings, folks, 
going up and smoke.

177
00:12:57,259 --> 00:12:59,502
It's about 
the abandoned employees 
who need their jobs.

178
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,125
It's about the people 
in the community

179
00:13:01,263 --> 00:13:03,817
who depended on this market 
to feed their families.

180
00:13:04,542 --> 00:13:09,098
And this is madness folks, 
festering in the hearts 
of the human-- of humanity 
in this city.

181
00:13:09,547 --> 00:13:11,998
Stay home, and make sure you know where your kids are,

182
00:13:12,136 --> 00:13:15,967
but whatever you do, stay calm. Stay calm and do not panic.

183
00:13:17,106 --> 00:13:21,041
A store owner, a woman, 
told me a story 
about her 19 year-old son,

184
00:13:21,179 --> 00:13:23,078
-who was almost 
beaten to death...
-This is disgusting.

185
00:13:23,285 --> 00:13:25,874
What the hell
do these people think
they're going to resolve
back to him like this?

186
00:13:26,598 --> 00:13:27,634
Come on, let's shoot some
pool.

187
00:13:28,462 --> 00:13:30,361
Hell of a way
to spend Christmas.

188
00:13:30,499 --> 00:13:32,397
-[Harry] ...we can stop this, 
we must stop this...
-Come on, man. Come on.

189
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:35,366
-[Williams] Oh.
-[man] Ah, Jesus, man.

190
00:13:35,504 --> 00:13:38,058
-Hey man, I'm really sorry.
-Why don't you watch
where the fuck you're going?

191
00:13:38,783 --> 00:13:40,026
[chuckles]
I'm sorry, man. Listen,

192
00:13:40,302 --> 00:13:42,891
-um, drinks on me, okay?
-We don't want your drinks.

193
00:13:43,305 --> 00:13:46,411
Why aren't you out there
burning down the city
with the rest of the brothers?

194
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:49,380
What's your problem, man?

195
00:13:50,691 --> 00:13:51,727
Tuesday night,

196
00:13:52,279 --> 00:13:53,108
six o'clock,

197
00:13:53,487 --> 00:13:54,419
me and my friends,

198
00:13:55,144 --> 00:13:56,559
we like to go and play
a little softball.

199
00:13:56,732 --> 00:13:59,735
It's a ritual that's lasted
13 years and three marriages.

200
00:13:59,873 --> 00:14:00,736
And tonight,

201
00:14:01,081 --> 00:14:03,290
they tell us,
we can't play softball.

202
00:14:03,428 --> 00:14:05,465
-Because the spits
and the niggers are out there...
-Watch it!

203
00:14:05,603 --> 00:14:07,122
...burning down
the goddamn city.

204
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:08,951
Listen mate,
why don't you just calm down?

205
00:14:09,193 --> 00:14:10,539
We're not looking
for any trouble.

206
00:14:11,712 --> 00:14:13,611
I know the riots have gotten
everyone a little bit edgy.

207
00:14:14,129 --> 00:14:15,993
Why don't we just have a drink
and forget about it, huh?

208
00:14:16,303 --> 00:14:17,166
You talk funny.

209
00:14:17,787 --> 00:14:18,754
Where are you from?

210
00:14:19,928 --> 00:14:21,032
England. Why?

211
00:14:21,619 --> 00:14:23,172
That's a great country.
[chuckles]

212
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:25,312
I did the last half of my tour
in the Marines in England.

213
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:27,211
Hey, you gotta tell me
something, really.

214
00:14:28,695 --> 00:14:30,041
Do Englishmen know how to fuck?

215
00:14:31,077 --> 00:14:33,458
[chuckles]
Because the Englishwomen
couldn't get enough of this.

216
00:14:33,769 --> 00:14:34,804
So either,

217
00:14:35,219 --> 00:14:36,703
Englishmen don't know
how to do it...

218
00:14:37,635 --> 00:14:39,602
[chuckles]
...or they're all faggots.
Which is it?

219
00:14:40,155 --> 00:14:41,466
[all laugh]

220
00:14:41,984 --> 00:14:42,985
Yeah.

221
00:14:43,641 --> 00:14:44,607
Come on, Williams.

222
00:14:45,574 --> 00:14:46,575
Let's get out of here.

223
00:14:49,509 --> 00:14:51,269
Hey! Hey where are you going?

224
00:14:51,821 --> 00:14:53,513
[man] Oh, you gonna go home
and do it together?

225
00:14:53,651 --> 00:14:54,790
[all laughing]

226
00:14:54,928 --> 00:14:56,309
That's it, man. That's it.

227
00:14:56,447 --> 00:14:57,793
-That's it.
-Hey, Williams.

228
00:14:58,138 --> 00:14:59,968
-[indistinct chatter]
-Let's close this place first.

229
00:15:01,659 --> 00:15:02,902
[balls racking]

230
00:15:04,973 --> 00:15:07,044
[funky Christmas music playing]

231
00:15:12,739 --> 00:15:13,982
[all grunt]

232
00:15:39,766 --> 00:15:41,009
[grunting continues]

233
00:15:41,457 --> 00:15:42,458
[glass breaks]

234
00:16:39,722 --> 00:16:40,792
[Williams] Come on!

235
00:16:47,489 --> 00:16:48,490
-[bone cracks]
-Ah!

236
00:16:55,842 --> 00:16:57,292
Look man, if you're done
playing with these guys

237
00:16:57,430 --> 00:16:58,707
I suggest we get
the hell out of here.

238
00:16:58,845 --> 00:17:01,158
Who told you I was playing?
You did that yourself.

239
00:17:03,298 --> 00:17:04,713
[men grunting]

240
00:17:30,256 --> 00:17:31,291
All right.

241
00:17:43,441 --> 00:17:44,408
[man] Please.

242
00:17:45,029 --> 00:17:46,203
This must be the place.

243
00:17:49,551 --> 00:17:51,553
Major Alcott, Major Williams,

244
00:17:51,725 --> 00:17:53,762
I've got orders to bring you
back to the British Embassy.

245
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:55,108
ASAP.

246
00:17:55,557 --> 00:17:56,592
Let's hit it.

247
00:17:57,662 --> 00:17:58,698
There goes our night off.

248
00:18:00,044 --> 00:18:01,563
You guys have been kicking
some ass, huh?

249
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:04,980
Make yourself comfortable, sir.

250
00:18:05,222 --> 00:18:06,326
[man] Can you help us here?

251
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,432
-[man] Please sir.
-Let's hit it.

252
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:09,743
[indistinct chatter]

253
00:18:15,749 --> 00:18:18,304
[sirens blaring]

254
00:18:22,204 --> 00:18:24,931
[indistinct clamoring]

255
00:18:30,005 --> 00:18:32,145
[crickets chirping]

256
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:41,016
[brakes squeaking]

257
00:18:50,612 --> 00:18:51,682
[doorbell rings]

258
00:19:02,313 --> 00:19:04,591
Mr. Alcott.
So happy to see you, sir.

259
00:19:04,729 --> 00:19:06,386
Hello, Arthur.
It's good to see you again.

260
00:19:07,353 --> 00:19:09,700
-This is Major Williams.
-Very pleased to meet you.

261
00:19:10,735 --> 00:19:11,909
So, what's the urgency?

262
00:19:12,392 --> 00:19:14,291
They're waiting for you
in the library, sir.

263
00:19:14,946 --> 00:19:15,982
Thank you.

264
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:26,199
Shane. Thank you
so much for coming.

265
00:19:26,441 --> 00:19:27,787
Ambassador, how are you?

266
00:19:28,236 --> 00:19:29,823
I'm all right.
You're looking well.

267
00:19:29,961 --> 00:19:31,411
I want you to meet somebody.
Come on, in.

268
00:19:32,964 --> 00:19:34,242
[Ambassador]
Special Agent Devaney,

269
00:19:35,484 --> 00:19:36,796
Major Shane Alcott.

270
00:19:37,728 --> 00:19:38,763
Major Alcott.

271
00:19:39,074 --> 00:19:40,455
And of course, you know,
Major Williams.

272
00:19:40,731 --> 00:19:41,732
-Sir.
-Major.

273
00:19:42,353 --> 00:19:44,113
Please. Take a seat.

274
00:19:52,674 --> 00:19:55,124
The reason I asked you here is,
because of Anna Lisa.

275
00:19:55,332 --> 00:19:56,367
Anna Lisa?

276
00:19:56,712 --> 00:19:58,852
-Why? What's happened?
-I'm afraid she's...

277
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:03,857
She was on her way
to a photoshoot
with her friend, Amy.

278
00:20:04,755 --> 00:20:06,515
And the bloody riots came about.

279
00:20:06,757 --> 00:20:08,345
I didn't hear from her
for hours.

280
00:20:10,347 --> 00:20:12,245
Police found her driver
shot through the head.

281
00:20:14,005 --> 00:20:15,455
I-- I feared she was dead.

282
00:20:20,771 --> 00:20:22,048
Unti-- until...

283
00:20:24,706 --> 00:20:27,018
The Ambassador received
this ransom demand.

284
00:20:28,088 --> 00:20:30,470
-You mean, she's been kidnapped?
-I'm afraid so.

285
00:20:31,299 --> 00:20:32,438
[VCR clicks]

286
00:20:33,473 --> 00:20:34,785
[Shyboy] Mr. Ambassador,

287
00:20:35,268 --> 00:20:37,512
I'm sure you're probably 
real worried, right about now.

288
00:20:38,478 --> 00:20:40,239
But, I want you 
to be confident to know,

289
00:20:41,826 --> 00:20:43,172
that I got the bitches.

290
00:20:44,208 --> 00:20:45,244
That's right.

291
00:20:46,003 --> 00:20:47,798
Now this is what I want 
you to do for me.

292
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:51,595
Have one motherfucker...

293
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:53,769
that's one man.

294
00:20:54,563 --> 00:20:58,015
Bring two million dollars 
to the church 
on 8th and Central.

295
00:20:58,602 --> 00:21:00,776
No guns, no cops.

296
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:03,365
No Feds, no bullshit.

297
00:21:04,815 --> 00:21:07,162
And don't be 
one fucking second late.

298
00:21:07,507 --> 00:21:09,682
Or I will personally 
hand-deliver you

299
00:21:11,994 --> 00:21:14,445
one dead bitch.

300
00:21:16,033 --> 00:21:17,862
Do I make my 
goddamn self clear?

301
00:21:19,105 --> 00:21:21,590
[Devaney]
We only have three hours
and 42 minutes left.

302
00:21:22,591 --> 00:21:26,526
Kidnapper's Leon Hues,
known to the police as Shyboy.

303
00:21:27,078 --> 00:21:30,841
He's a leader
of a street gang,
known as the "3rd Street Crips."

304
00:21:31,151 --> 00:21:34,223
And, uh, from what we can tell
the kidnapping was random.

305
00:21:35,363 --> 00:21:36,571
Inside this circle,

306
00:21:37,192 --> 00:21:38,538
is a no-man's land.

307
00:21:38,883 --> 00:21:41,092
Nobody gets in
and nobody gets out.

308
00:21:42,093 --> 00:21:44,786
The exchange point,
the smack-dab in the middle.

309
00:21:46,097 --> 00:21:48,376
And about the only company
you're gonna find here

310
00:21:48,514 --> 00:21:52,276
are gun crazy looters, uh,
gang bangers and...

311
00:21:52,863 --> 00:21:54,589
scared shitless store owners.

312
00:21:56,453 --> 00:21:58,765
Shane, I know
your reputation and, uh...

313
00:22:01,458 --> 00:22:04,392
And I have no doubt that you
are one of the best operatives
in the world,

314
00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:05,772
but in this situation...

315
00:22:06,773 --> 00:22:08,257
you're outnumbered, 30 to one.

316
00:22:09,604 --> 00:22:11,088
There's still have time
to send in a team.

317
00:22:11,226 --> 00:22:13,366
[Arthur] No,
I can't risk her life.

318
00:22:13,642 --> 00:22:14,850
They asked for one man.

319
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:16,921
They'll get one man.

320
00:22:17,577 --> 00:22:18,647
[Williams] It's a suicide.

321
00:22:19,303 --> 00:22:20,304
No way, Shane.

322
00:22:21,374 --> 00:22:22,375
No way.

323
00:22:33,006 --> 00:22:34,629
Two million, embassy tab.
Don't lose it,

324
00:22:35,284 --> 00:22:38,909
Garrison will drive
you to the airstrip.
Major Williams will fly you in,

325
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:42,775
drop you off, six blocks
from the rendezvous point
so they don't get spooked.

326
00:22:42,913 --> 00:22:45,294
You know what to do.
Now, you got two hours
to get this girl

327
00:22:45,433 --> 00:22:47,607
and get back to the drop sight
for extraction.

328
00:22:48,677 --> 00:22:49,540
Good luck.

329
00:23:08,766 --> 00:23:10,216
Shane, take a look
down here, man.

330
00:23:10,734 --> 00:23:11,942
I don't know about this one.

331
00:23:12,356 --> 00:23:13,495
You sure, you wanna do this?

332
00:23:14,116 --> 00:23:16,325
So how come you never
talk about this
Ana Lisa anyway?

333
00:23:17,050 --> 00:23:18,224
Hey, man. You listening to me?

334
00:23:18,362 --> 00:23:20,053
[dance music playing]

335
00:23:20,226 --> 00:23:21,986
[cameras flashing]

336
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:34,482
Come on, come on,
come on, ladies.

337
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:36,276
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

338
00:23:36,518 --> 00:23:38,934
Ah, Anna Lisa, yes.
Okay, what's--

339
00:23:39,314 --> 00:23:41,247
-What is this?
-What?

340
00:23:41,661 --> 00:23:44,388
[speaking French]

341
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:47,702
You have this fluff--
fluff all over your dress.

342
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,013
I didn't dress myself.

343
00:23:49,151 --> 00:23:51,326
Ah, what did you just
roll around in this fluff, hmm?

344
00:23:51,464 --> 00:23:53,224
-Am I okay?
-No, you're not okay.

345
00:23:53,362 --> 00:23:54,985
And these shoes,
where did you get these shoes?

346
00:23:55,123 --> 00:23:57,608
-Marco gave these shoes to me.
I couldn't...
-Marco gave these shoes?

347
00:23:58,298 --> 00:24:00,197
Well, come on,
you must get out.
Go, go, go, go, go.

348
00:24:00,335 --> 00:24:01,612
Marco, Marco!

349
00:24:02,751 --> 00:24:03,787
Shane.

350
00:24:04,063 --> 00:24:05,305
You shouldn't be back here.

351
00:24:06,479 --> 00:24:09,275
-You looked great, out there.
-Well, I'm glad
you're enjoying the show.

352
00:24:10,207 --> 00:24:11,829
-Gotta go.
-Wait a minute.

353
00:24:15,108 --> 00:24:16,144
[Shane sighs]

354
00:24:16,938 --> 00:24:17,870
What's wrong?

355
00:24:22,081 --> 00:24:23,082
I've gotten orders.

356
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:26,706
I'm gonna leave
on an assignment.

357
00:24:29,329 --> 00:24:30,227
Where?

358
00:24:32,505 --> 00:24:33,989
You know I can't tell you that.

359
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:36,371
Well, can you call me
or is that forbidden too?

360
00:24:37,199 --> 00:24:38,407
Of course, I will.

361
00:24:39,201 --> 00:24:40,306
First chance, I get.

362
00:24:43,205 --> 00:24:45,622
-[crowd applauding]
-Come on, Anna Lisa,
you're next. Please.

363
00:24:46,415 --> 00:24:48,210
-I gotta go.
-Anna Lisa, wait a minute.

364
00:24:48,797 --> 00:24:49,798
What?

365
00:24:50,454 --> 00:24:51,490
What?

366
00:24:54,596 --> 00:24:55,666
I wanna marry you.

367
00:24:57,944 --> 00:24:59,290
Look, I know
this is hard for you,

368
00:25:00,119 --> 00:25:01,430
but, I want you to wait for me.

369
00:25:10,439 --> 00:25:12,511
Can you wait around?
I get off in an hour.

370
00:25:13,753 --> 00:25:14,685
I can't.

371
00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:17,170
My flight leaves
in half an hour.

372
00:25:19,241 --> 00:25:20,277
Goodbye, Shane.

373
00:25:22,141 --> 00:25:23,176
I love you.

374
00:25:23,487 --> 00:25:24,523
Love you too.

375
00:25:25,109 --> 00:25:27,180
[footsteps retreating]

376
00:25:27,871 --> 00:25:29,700
-Goodbye, Lisa.
-[Williams] Here,

377
00:25:30,149 --> 00:25:31,046
take this.

378
00:25:32,876 --> 00:25:33,911
No way.

379
00:25:34,256 --> 00:25:36,535
He said, no guns.
It's an ankle gun, man.

380
00:25:37,397 --> 00:25:38,295
They won't see it.

381
00:25:39,261 --> 00:25:40,124
No way.

382
00:25:41,056 --> 00:25:43,611
What are you
talking about, Shane?
Take the gun. Take it.

383
00:25:43,956 --> 00:25:46,096
-Look, I can't risk it.
-You'll need it.

384
00:25:47,304 --> 00:25:49,617
-What are you, a psychic?
-Just trust me, man.

385
00:25:55,174 --> 00:25:56,382
What am I gonna do with this?

386
00:25:57,141 --> 00:25:58,833
I might as well
been carrying a peashooter.

387
00:25:59,627 --> 00:26:02,422
I'd have to hit
the guy six times with this
before it even does anything.

388
00:26:04,010 --> 00:26:05,011
[exhales]

389
00:26:05,218 --> 00:26:06,254
Okay.

390
00:26:13,054 --> 00:26:14,780
[Williams] This is Red Leader 
to Army Two.

391
00:26:15,125 --> 00:26:17,161
[man] Army Two. 
Go ahead Red Leader.

392
00:26:17,299 --> 00:26:18,887
[Williams] I'm closing in 
on the drop sight.

393
00:26:19,301 --> 00:26:22,166
From what I can see, 
our approach is clear. 
Can you confirm?

394
00:26:22,408 --> 00:26:24,548
[man] Affirmative. 
Your airspace is clear.

395
00:26:24,859 --> 00:26:26,032
Watch for ground fire.

396
00:26:26,377 --> 00:26:27,689
[Williams] Roger 
that, Army Two.

397
00:26:28,034 --> 00:26:29,104
Red Leader out.

398
00:26:30,934 --> 00:26:31,935
This is the place.

399
00:26:33,557 --> 00:26:34,938
I'm not too sure
about this, man.

400
00:26:36,318 --> 00:26:37,596
I'll be fine. Just put it down.

401
00:26:55,130 --> 00:26:57,719
I wish I was going
with you, man.
Like good, old times.

402
00:26:58,513 --> 00:27:00,653
-Yeah, I know.
-She must be pretty special.

403
00:27:01,343 --> 00:27:03,138
Yeah, she is.

404
00:27:04,243 --> 00:27:05,520
Don't forget
to pick me up, huh?

405
00:27:06,486 --> 00:27:08,040
I'll be right here, man.

406
00:27:09,697 --> 00:27:11,560
Good luck, buddy. Be careful.

Don't you know,
you get fucked up in here?

417
00:28:11,897 --> 00:28:13,795
Hey man, you got some of my 40?
Me and my boys?

418
00:28:14,244 --> 00:28:15,383
I know you got some--

Give it up.

See, mama wanted me
to be a preacher.

will always watch
over you, Leon."

00:35:45,281 --> 00:35:47,559
we was gonna pop a cap
in your ass, the second
you walked up in here.

Well, I figured, they may have
wanna go send me no dummy

the rest is before I splat
your motherfucking brains

00:38:16,639 --> 00:38:17,640
[Anna screams]

520
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:20,056
[men screaming]

521
00:38:21,022 --> 00:38:22,058
[Anna] Shane!

522
00:38:23,335 --> 00:38:24,336
[Anna screams]

523
00:38:33,897 --> 00:38:35,520
-What are you doing?
-Just go!

524
00:38:38,730 --> 00:38:39,731
[Shane grunts]

525
00:38:57,783 --> 00:38:58,681
Yo, move.

526
00:39:00,855 --> 00:39:02,098
[Anna screams]

527
00:39:03,479 --> 00:39:04,480
[Anna and Shane grunt]

528
00:39:12,867 --> 00:39:13,868
[Anna screams]

529
00:39:15,594 --> 00:39:17,044
[Anna grunts]

530
00:39:30,298 --> 00:39:32,024
-Help me, Shane.
-Come on baby, let's go.

531
00:39:33,198 --> 00:39:34,648
Let's get that motherfucker.

532
00:39:53,805 --> 00:39:56,048
[Anna panting]

533
00:39:57,567 --> 00:39:59,880
I'm Kathy Austin, 
with KKGL News,

534
00:40:00,018 --> 00:40:02,296
coming to you live, in front of the British Embassy,

535
00:40:02,538 --> 00:40:04,229
where we have just 
been informed

536
00:40:04,471 --> 00:40:08,509
that Anna Lisa Gray, daughter of British Ambassador, Alexander Gray,

537
00:40:08,923 --> 00:40:11,236
has been kidnapped at gunpoint.

538
00:40:11,788 --> 00:40:14,239
FBI agents are here 
at the embassy now,

539
00:40:14,377 --> 00:40:16,931
and are currently 
inside in closed meetings.

540
00:40:17,484 --> 00:40:20,245
[Harry] Federal troops have thrown a barricade around the violent areas

541
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:23,144
and they've been able to keep it from spreading so far.

542
00:40:23,766 --> 00:40:25,423
I think that 
ourAction 9 news team

543
00:40:25,561 --> 00:40:28,633
is the only crew that's working behind the army periphery.

544
00:40:29,081 --> 00:40:32,119
I've heard that another helicopter from one of the other channels,

545
00:40:32,706 --> 00:40:35,950
came down while they were trying to get over this territory here. I--

546
00:40:36,192 --> 00:40:38,539
I don't know whether there are any survivors right now or not.

547
00:40:39,644 --> 00:40:41,887
We'll keep trying to transmit to you as long as we can...

548
00:40:42,025 --> 00:40:43,337
-[door opens] 
-...but I'll tell you folks,

549
00:40:43,613 --> 00:40:45,063
it looks like this 
Christmas Eve

550
00:40:45,201 --> 00:40:46,754
-is gonna be a long, long 
night.
-[door closes]

551
00:40:47,168 --> 00:40:50,517
[Harry] Fortunately, we were able to find safety with a platoon of National Guardsmen,

552
00:40:50,655 --> 00:40:52,553
who're doing the best to keep order downtown.

553
00:40:52,691 --> 00:40:54,866
I'm telling you, I've never seen anything like this before.

554
00:40:55,798 --> 00:40:58,801
And I wouldn't wanna be two blocks west of where I am, right now 'cause there's a...

555
00:40:58,939 --> 00:41:01,010
-What's up, Major?
-[Harry] ...major outbreak of looting...

556
00:41:01,251 --> 00:41:03,357
-Want a drink?
-Where's my chopper?

557
00:41:03,909 --> 00:41:04,910
Every thing's grounded.

558
00:41:05,566 --> 00:41:07,395
They just shot down
the TV helicopter.

559
00:41:07,879 --> 00:41:08,880
So, what does that mean?

560
00:41:09,674 --> 00:41:10,468
What about Shane?

561
00:41:11,434 --> 00:41:12,918
-I'm sorry.
-You're sorry?

562
00:41:14,023 --> 00:41:15,473
Does the Ambassador
know about this?

563
00:41:17,544 --> 00:41:18,786
I haven't told him, yet.

564
00:41:19,097 --> 00:41:21,271
You son of a bitch.
You're gonna let
him die, out there.

565
00:41:21,651 --> 00:41:24,792
Hey listen, let me tell you
something, I don't like this
any more than you do.

566
00:41:25,172 --> 00:41:27,554
There's nothing more I can do.
My hands are tied.

567
00:41:27,899 --> 00:41:28,900
You make me sick.

568
00:41:29,107 --> 00:41:30,142
Sick!

569
00:41:33,870 --> 00:41:34,940
-Major?
-What?

570
00:41:36,217 --> 00:41:37,253
Come here.

571
00:41:39,566 --> 00:41:41,015
Major, if someone were to

572
00:41:41,775 --> 00:41:46,227
accidentally find the keys
to helicopter 124DA,

573
00:41:46,987 --> 00:41:49,541
then, I would have
no knowledge of that person.

574
00:41:49,955 --> 00:41:50,853
But,

575
00:41:51,681 --> 00:41:53,683
if that person were caught,

576
00:41:54,373 --> 00:41:57,411
disobeying a command order,
then of course...

577
00:41:57,756 --> 00:41:59,586
-[keys jingle]
-...that person
would not know me.

578
00:42:02,278 --> 00:42:03,244
Good luck, Major.

579
00:42:05,868 --> 00:42:06,869
Thank you, sir.

580
00:42:10,010 --> 00:42:12,737
-[Anna breathing heavily]
-[sirens blaring]

581
00:42:30,927 --> 00:42:33,343
[indistinct clamoring]

582
00:42:36,346 --> 00:42:37,382
[Shane] Okay, in here.

583
00:42:37,727 --> 00:42:38,728
[Anna] Oh, thank god.

584
00:42:40,454 --> 00:42:41,489
[Shane grunts]

585
00:43:01,337 --> 00:43:02,580
[sobs]

586
00:43:09,241 --> 00:43:10,380
I'm sorry about your friend.

587
00:43:19,527 --> 00:43:21,702
[indistinct chatter]

588
00:43:24,809 --> 00:43:27,294
Ain't no motherfuckers
can't just disappear.

589
00:43:29,123 --> 00:43:30,608
They gotta be here, somewhere!

590
00:43:32,126 --> 00:43:33,921
We're gonna find their ass.

591
00:43:36,372 --> 00:43:38,098
[indistinct chatter in distance]

592
00:43:57,255 --> 00:43:58,705
I want you to know Shane,

593
00:44:00,499 --> 00:44:02,294
the reason I broke
our engagement.

594
00:44:03,779 --> 00:44:04,780
No, please.

595
00:44:05,608 --> 00:44:06,816
The past is the past.

596
00:44:08,576 --> 00:44:11,131
I couldn't stand the idea
about being separated.

597
00:44:12,408 --> 00:44:14,410
You were always gone
for so long.

598
00:44:15,687 --> 00:44:17,206
Everything's so secret.

599
00:44:18,483 --> 00:44:20,554
I thought I could,
but I'm sorry.

600
00:44:20,865 --> 00:44:22,694
I would've given it
up for you, Anna Lisa.

601
00:44:23,971 --> 00:44:25,283
I would've done
anything for you.

602
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:27,665
I loved you.

603
00:44:29,114 --> 00:44:30,426
I loved you so much.

604
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:33,118
All you had to do,
was say the word.

605
00:44:37,122 --> 00:44:38,158
I was young...

606
00:44:39,504 --> 00:44:41,471
but I felt I had no choice.

607
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:45,165
You had a choice, Anna Lisa.

608
00:44:46,304 --> 00:44:48,133
-We all had choices.
-[helicopter blades whirring]

609
00:44:48,616 --> 00:44:49,652
I had a choice.

610
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:52,655
And I chose to come
here for you.

611
00:45:09,879 --> 00:45:10,949
I love you, Shane.

612
00:45:38,390 --> 00:45:40,116
We got ten minutes
to get to the chopper.

613
00:45:55,373 --> 00:45:57,478
[siren blaring]

614
00:46:15,358 --> 00:46:16,428
Where are you going, Major?

615
00:46:16,808 --> 00:46:19,190
I'm headed to the airfield
to take the chopper for a ride.

616
00:46:19,846 --> 00:46:21,157
Is it okay with you, soldier?

617
00:46:22,710 --> 00:46:24,609
I need to see
your authorization papers, sir.

618
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:26,231
All air crafts have
been grounded, sir.

619
00:46:26,369 --> 00:46:28,751
-Commander Louis said, sir--
-Commander Louis said?

620
00:46:28,993 --> 00:46:29,959
Tell me, Cooper,

621
00:46:30,270 --> 00:46:31,443
how long have you
been in the army?

622
00:46:32,099 --> 00:46:33,066
One year, sir.

623
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:35,171
I've been here for 15 years.

624
00:46:35,551 --> 00:46:37,035
Now, what do you
think that means?

625
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:39,072
You're a career-man, sir.

626
00:46:39,210 --> 00:46:40,798
And do you think
I'll risk my neck

627
00:46:41,039 --> 00:46:42,592
for an unauthorized
flight release?

628
00:46:43,386 --> 00:46:44,284
Well, do you, Cooper?

629
00:46:45,043 --> 00:46:47,701
Or maybe, I should refer to you
as Private Cooper.

630
00:46:48,322 --> 00:46:49,358
No, sir.

631
00:46:52,257 --> 00:46:53,431
Have a nice flight, sir.

632
00:47:04,304 --> 00:47:07,479
[Harry] Death toll, 
right now, is estimated at 65

633
00:47:07,617 --> 00:47:09,205
while the number 
of injured is just...

634
00:47:09,688 --> 00:47:10,689
Thanks.

635
00:47:14,107 --> 00:47:16,074
As if I didn't have
enough to worry about.

636
00:47:19,526 --> 00:47:21,148
God help you, Alcott.

637
00:47:22,736 --> 00:47:23,771
God help you.

638
00:47:42,825 --> 00:47:43,861
That's our ride.

639
00:48:05,468 --> 00:48:07,160
All we gotta do is,
get to the roof

640
00:48:07,746 --> 00:48:08,782
and we're outta here.

641
00:48:11,474 --> 00:48:12,475
You ready for this?

642
00:48:12,648 --> 00:48:13,614
Ready.

643
00:48:15,168 --> 00:48:16,203
Okay, let's go.

644
00:48:18,481 --> 00:48:20,380
Does that motherfucker
think we're stupid? Yo.

645
00:48:20,690 --> 00:48:22,002
He's right up
on that goddamn roof.

646
00:48:22,140 --> 00:48:24,142
You, you go to the front.
You take the back.

647
00:48:24,453 --> 00:48:25,937
Boys, come with me.
Let's do this shit.

[Anna breathing heavily]

649
00:48:41,780 --> 00:48:43,541
-Right in here.
-Okay.

Come on, come on. Hurry, hurry.

Come on! Get in, get in!

669
00:51:05,717 --> 00:51:07,064
Okay Williams.
Get us out of here, man.

-Let's go.
-We're out of here.

You okay, hon?

Yes.

673
00:51:32,986 --> 00:51:34,021
Yo, baby.

674
00:51:42,409 --> 00:51:43,928
Time to meet the devil,
motherfucker.

-What was that?
-Jesus Christ. We've been hit.

-I'm losing it.

-Take us down!
-I'm losing control, Shane.

679
00:51:58,218 --> 00:51:59,599
Come on Williams, get us down.

I got her.

It's okay, Anna Lisa. Let go!

[Shane] Hang on to her,
Williams. Get her out of here.

Get on the roof.

[Williams grunts]

695
00:52:54,792 --> 00:52:55,793
[Williams] Hold me.

696
00:53:03,870 --> 00:53:05,009
[Williams] Pull me up, Shane.

697
00:53:05,837 --> 00:53:07,253
Don't let me fall, Shane.

698
00:53:07,460 --> 00:53:08,288
[Shyboy] Yeah.

699
00:53:11,671 --> 00:53:12,672
[Williams] Shane.

700
00:53:13,638 --> 00:53:15,537
-[Shane] Hold on!
-[Williams] Hold-- hold me.

701
00:53:17,159 --> 00:53:18,298
[Williams] I'm-- I'm slipping.

702
00:53:20,507 --> 00:53:22,647
-Hang in there buddy.
-Don't let me drop man

703
00:53:28,343 --> 00:53:29,344
Hold me.

704
00:53:29,827 --> 00:53:31,035
Come on, baby, come on, come on.

705
00:53:32,312 --> 00:53:33,382
[Williams] I'm losing my grip.

706
00:53:34,038 --> 00:53:35,764
Come on, come--
Come to fucking daddy.

707
00:53:37,869 --> 00:53:38,905
[Williams grunts]

708
00:53:40,769 --> 00:53:41,873
Pull us up!

709
00:53:42,943 --> 00:53:44,704
Give up, motherfucker!

710
00:53:47,396 --> 00:53:48,259
[Williams] Help me.

711
00:53:50,434 --> 00:53:52,332
-Help me.
-Pull us up!

712
00:53:53,471 --> 00:53:54,955
Pull me up, Shane.

713
00:53:56,888 --> 00:53:57,648
Come on. Here it is.

714
00:53:59,132 --> 00:54:00,996
-Yeah!
-No!

715
00:54:01,134 --> 00:54:05,414
No, Williams!

716
00:54:15,252 --> 00:54:16,701
Got that son of a bitch!

717
00:54:17,771 --> 00:54:18,772
[both scream]

718
00:54:19,566 --> 00:54:21,499
[screams] No!

719
00:54:22,189 --> 00:54:23,501
No!

720
00:54:32,959 --> 00:54:33,891
[door opens]

721
00:54:36,411 --> 00:54:38,275
[footsteps approaching]

722
00:54:39,137 --> 00:54:40,898
Well, well, the money is mine.

723
00:54:42,486 --> 00:54:44,453
You said it was easier
than getting laid

724
00:54:44,591 --> 00:54:46,490
in a whorehouse with a fist
full of hundreds.

725
00:54:47,284 --> 00:54:48,215
Yeah, that's what I said.

726
00:54:49,493 --> 00:54:51,564
But, you didn't fucking tell me
he was sending G.I. Joe to

727
00:54:51,702 --> 00:54:52,979
goddamn rescue, either.

728
00:54:54,394 --> 00:54:55,430
[grunts]

729
00:55:01,298 --> 00:55:02,471
Here's what we'll do.

730
00:55:03,127 --> 00:55:06,130
We separate into teams
and cover this grid
from end to end.

731
00:55:06,579 --> 00:55:08,374
Use channel six
in your scanners.

732
00:55:08,788 --> 00:55:10,203
Find Shane Alcott.

733
00:55:10,824 --> 00:55:12,067
Get the money and the girl...

734
00:55:13,620 --> 00:55:15,242
-and kill him.
-Oh, shit.

735
00:55:16,554 --> 00:55:17,452
What?

736
00:55:19,143 --> 00:55:20,558
They don't look
like gang members.

737
00:55:21,870 --> 00:55:22,733
They're not.

738
00:55:23,941 --> 00:55:25,149
Now, what do you mean?

739
00:55:25,287 --> 00:55:27,634
That Rambo motherfucker took
out five of my best men.

740
00:55:27,772 --> 00:55:28,946
That's what the fuck, I mean.

741
00:55:29,774 --> 00:55:31,535
You shady, man.

742
00:55:32,121 --> 00:55:35,780
You paint this
perfect fucking picture
while this shit's supposed to
go down, but yet somehow,

743
00:55:35,918 --> 00:55:38,300
you failed to warn us
what the fuck we up against.

744
00:55:38,542 --> 00:55:40,509
Half of my fucking men, dead!

745
00:55:41,407 --> 00:55:42,339
The way I see it,

746
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:45,342
you owe me every fucking
red cent of this goddamn money.

747
00:55:46,446 --> 00:55:48,310
Now, I didn't ask
for your opinion, did I?

748
00:55:49,311 --> 00:55:50,968
I asked you to do a simple job.

749
00:55:51,209 --> 00:55:53,211
To get the man's money
and return with the woman.

750
00:55:53,522 --> 00:55:55,213
And you come back empty handed.

751
00:55:55,766 --> 00:55:57,664
I told you,
we couldn't trust his kind.

752
00:55:57,802 --> 00:56:00,218
-What the fuck you say?
-No, no, no, no, no.

753
00:56:00,357 --> 00:56:02,324
We mustn't let color come
in between us.

754
00:56:02,945 --> 00:56:05,879
A man is a man.
Isn't that right, Shy...

755
00:56:06,846 --> 00:56:07,743
boy?

756
00:56:09,158 --> 00:56:11,160
Even if he has
just made a mistake.

757
00:56:12,507 --> 00:56:13,749
Oh, I didn't make no mistake.

758
00:56:14,854 --> 00:56:17,753
Other than dealing
with your sorry,
peckerwood, white ass.

759
00:56:18,927 --> 00:56:19,962
[chuckles]

760
00:56:20,377 --> 00:56:21,585
That's Bryan O'Flaherty.

761
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:23,345
Green Eagle Provo.

762
00:56:24,242 --> 00:56:25,174
IRA?

763
00:56:27,832 --> 00:56:30,007
Yeah, this whole thing
is beginning
to make sense now.

764
00:56:31,388 --> 00:56:32,975
Your kidnapping wasn't random.

765
00:56:34,252 --> 00:56:35,392
He knew I'd come after you.

766
00:56:37,601 --> 00:56:38,740
Come on, let's get out of here.

767
00:56:39,154 --> 00:56:40,569
They'll be all over this roof
in minutes.

768
00:56:41,570 --> 00:56:43,952
Why the fuck, do you wanna keep
playing games, man, huh?

769
00:56:44,711 --> 00:56:46,023
-[sirens approaching]
-The deal was,

770
00:56:46,333 --> 00:56:48,646
half the money
for that stupid bitch.

771
00:56:48,991 --> 00:56:50,165
Do you see a girl here?

772
00:56:51,028 --> 00:56:54,031
Patrick? Do you see a female,
anywhere around here?

773
00:56:54,859 --> 00:56:56,171
I don't see a thing, Bryan.

774
00:56:57,379 --> 00:56:58,863
I didn't come this far
and not to get paid.

775
00:56:59,139 --> 00:57:01,556
I don't have the girl,
I lost half of my fucking men.

776
00:57:02,039 --> 00:57:03,281
So, what I'm telling you is...

777
00:57:03,627 --> 00:57:05,180
you break me off
half of what you owe me.

778
00:57:05,422 --> 00:57:07,113
And I swear to Almighty God,

779
00:57:07,424 --> 00:57:09,736
-I will have that bitch
back, like that.
-[snaps fingers]

780
00:57:15,639 --> 00:57:18,227
We mustn't let inconvenience
come between us.

781
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:20,367
You and I are much more alike
than we know.

782
00:57:20,609 --> 00:57:25,096
You're a man whose people
have been put upon
by an outside force
for centuries.

783
00:57:25,580 --> 00:57:27,547
I'm a man who knows
how that feels.

784
00:57:27,892 --> 00:57:29,549
You have
your American oppressors.

785
00:57:29,929 --> 00:57:31,206
And I have the British.

786
00:57:31,758 --> 00:57:34,071
So let's be fonder
of each other that we are.

787
00:57:34,727 --> 00:57:38,524
I just ask that you be mindful
of me political situation.

788
00:57:39,594 --> 00:57:41,561
'Cause I don't give a shit
about yours.

789
00:57:42,562 --> 00:57:43,563
[grunts]

790
00:57:53,918 --> 00:57:55,230
Pathetic pillocks.

791
00:57:56,265 --> 00:57:58,336
Gentlemen, we've got work to do.

792
00:58:30,541 --> 00:58:31,542
Do you see something?

793
00:58:35,857 --> 00:58:37,686
[IRA soldier]
He's a dangerous one.
Come on, come on.

794
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:40,206
I thought I saw him
around here somewhere.

795
00:58:41,794 --> 00:58:43,934
Look, about seven blocks
of west is Waverly Avenue.

796
00:58:44,762 --> 00:58:47,385
There's a police outpost there
that marks the ends
of the perimeter.

797
00:58:48,076 --> 00:58:50,837
That's the end of the riot zone.
If you can make it there
you'll be safe.

798
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:53,771
Me? I'm not going without you.

799
00:58:54,047 --> 00:58:56,153
-Anna Lisa, you've gotta go.
-No.

800
00:58:56,291 --> 00:58:58,327
-[sirens blaring]
-You two over there.

801
00:59:01,468 --> 00:59:03,332
-You're wasting time,
all right--
-I'm not going.

802
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:04,575
No!

803
00:59:05,093 --> 00:59:06,922
-Come on. Come on.
-Anna Lisa, you gotta go.

804
00:59:07,233 --> 00:59:08,337
Come with me.

805
00:59:09,442 --> 00:59:10,995
I gotta stay here
and take care of them. Go.

806
00:59:11,409 --> 00:59:12,376
Go!

807
00:59:13,757 --> 00:59:15,828
[bike engine revving]

808
00:59:19,176 --> 00:59:21,799
[IRA soldier] Check in between
that area. Go over there. Move.

809
00:59:28,737 --> 00:59:30,014
[IRA soldier] All right,
wait, wait, wait.

810
00:59:31,257 --> 00:59:33,224

820
01:04:23,480 --> 01:04:24,584
She went this way.

[Anna grunts]

822
01:04:55,650 --> 01:04:56,720
Oh!

823
01:05:04,003 --> 01:05:04,762
[Anna] Shane.

824
01:05:17,051 --> 01:05:17,948
You okay?

825
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:20,502
-I'm sorry, Shane.
-No.

826
01:05:20,640 --> 01:05:21,779
But we can still make it.

827
01:05:22,332 --> 01:05:23,229
No.

828
01:05:23,574 --> 01:05:24,817
We gotta get to
seen to first.

829
01:05:25,576 --> 01:05:26,439
Come on.

830
01:05:27,026 --> 01:05:27,924
Let's go.

-Where did he go?

832
01:05:34,413 --> 01:05:36,380
-Where did he go?
-I don't know.

833
01:05:36,656 --> 01:05:37,968
What do you mean,
you don't know?

834
01:05:38,244 --> 01:05:39,383
Where is everybody?

835
01:05:39,763 --> 01:05:42,248
-I don't know.
-What the fuck
is just going on here?

836
01:05:42,973 --> 01:05:44,526
Jesus fucking Christ!

837
01:05:44,871 --> 01:05:46,080
What are you, stupid?

838
01:05:46,528 --> 01:05:47,598
-Huh?
-[man grunts]

839
01:05:47,736 --> 01:05:49,428
Man, I don't know,
what the fuck's going on.

840
01:05:51,568 --> 01:05:52,603
Useless.

841
01:05:54,778 --> 01:05:55,813
Fuck!

842
01:06:03,718 --> 01:06:04,788
[glass shattering]

843
01:06:08,550 --> 01:06:09,724

01:06:30,089 --> 01:06:30,987
Come on.

-[man on TV] It's Bigfoot!
-[Bigfoot pants]

849

-[banging on door] 
-He's real.

851
01:06:48,038 --> 01:06:49,281
-Daddy, the door! 
-Faster.

852
01:06:49,729 --> 01:06:51,697
-Faster.
-[banging continues]

853
01:06:54,079 --> 01:06:55,425
I was watching that.

854
01:06:55,735 --> 01:06:57,703
-[Shane] Please open the door.
-[sirens blaring]

855
01:06:59,256 --> 01:07:01,293
-Yeah, what can I do for you?
-Let us in, please?

856
01:07:01,534 --> 01:07:02,466
She needs help.

857
01:07:03,847 --> 01:07:05,297
I'm sorry,
we can't help you here.

858
01:07:06,091 --> 01:07:07,713
Come on, man.
Can't you see she's bleeding?

859
01:07:08,438 --> 01:07:10,888
That's not my problem, man.
Now, move on.

860
01:07:11,337 --> 01:07:13,443
Look, if she doesn't get
treatment, she's gonna die.

861
01:07:14,892 --> 01:07:17,033
Get away from my door
and I don't want no trouble.

862
01:07:22,693 --> 01:07:24,557
-Go ahead, move on.
-[helicopter blades whirring]

863
01:07:33,359 --> 01:07:34,636
Daddy, maybe we should
help them.

864
01:07:34,774 --> 01:07:36,500
They'll figure
something out, all right?

865
01:07:37,467 --> 01:07:39,124
-Honey, what's going on?
-Oh, nothing. Just...

866
01:07:39,365 --> 01:07:41,436
[chuckles] Wait a minute.

867
01:07:41,816 --> 01:07:43,818
I heard voices out there,
what do you mean
nothing's going on?

868
01:07:43,956 --> 01:07:46,648
It's just some guy
with a girl and she's hurt,

869
01:07:46,786 --> 01:07:48,961
something like that.
I don't know, I sent them
on down the road, all right?

870
01:07:49,099 --> 01:07:50,169
She's hurt? Was she shot?

871

Look, I don't know
if she was shot or not.

872

is a hospital.

Look. We don't need
their problems.

a good Christmas.

an automatic rifle.

01:12:02,076 --> 01:12:04,181

into the riot zone.

Landing on the rooftop 
of a building to pick 
up the hostages.

However, immediately 
after takeoff,

942
01:12:09,877 --> 01:12:13,190
a malfunction 
caused the helicopter 
to lose control and crash,

on a nearby building.

[chuckles]

1039
01:24:51,948 --> 01:24:53,536
Well, let me make it
easy for you, Bryan.

1040
01:24:54,296 --> 01:24:55,400
Let'’s meet half way.

1041
01:24:57,954 --> 01:24:59,473
So, why don't you come 
and get me?

1042
01:25:01,234 --> 01:25:02,580
That I will, Shane.

1043
01:25:06,549 --> 01:25:09,518
I'll kill him for you, Patty.
And I'll make it slow.

1044
01:26:08,301 --> 01:26:09,302
[neck snaps]

1045
01:26:13,513 --> 01:26:14,548
[IRA soldier] There he goes!

1046
01:26:22,798 --> 01:26:23,730

[car engine starts]

1048
01:27:03,183 --> 01:27:04,219
[Shane screams]

1049
01:27:44,362 --> 01:27:46,157
You can run but you can't hide!

1050
01:28:10,043 --> 01:28:12,632
When I get done with you,
Fergie won't even want you.

1051
01:28:26,162 --> 01:28:27,198
[Shane grunts]

1052
01:28:58,712 --> 01:29:00,576
Well hello, Shane.

1053
01:29:19,354 --> 01:29:20,355
This one's for Patty.

1054
01:29:33,195 --> 01:29:34,334
[car engine starts]

1055

01:30:22,831 --> 01:30:23,935
[Shane screams]

1057
01:31:07,047 --> 01:31:08,117
[grunts]

1058
01:31:50,643 --> 01:31:53,128
Every minute is bringing us
a new story of courage

1059
01:31:53,266 --> 01:31:55,406
and determination
in the face of this violence.

1060
01:31:56,614 --> 01:31:58,858
Finally the good citizens
of this community are getting

1061
01:31:58,996 --> 01:32:00,307
the upper hand on the looting,

1062
01:32:00,860 --> 01:32:02,620
and the streets
are quieting down again.

1063
01:32:03,448 --> 01:32:05,899
People are crowding
into the churches.
They're asking:

1064
01:32:06,417 --> 01:32:08,523
"Why? How did something
like this happen?"

1065
01:32:09,627 --> 01:32:10,732
The answer that they're getting

1066
01:32:11,905 --> 01:32:13,804
is that the lessons
of that first Christmas

1067
01:32:15,081 --> 01:32:17,946
are as relevant now
as they ever were before.

1068
01:32:19,603 --> 01:32:22,571
That the sword
must give way to the plowshare.

1069
01:32:23,710 --> 01:32:25,540
The child must lead the man.

1070
01:32:26,817 --> 01:32:30,199
That each one of us, is in fact,
our brother's keeper.

1071
01:32:31,718 --> 01:32:33,202
And that violence like this,

1072
01:32:34,479 --> 01:32:36,551
must never, never occur again.

1073
01:32:37,759 --> 01:32:40,451
As dawn breaks 
over this healing city,

1074
01:32:41,970 --> 01:32:44,835
the words from that manger 
2,000 years ago,

1075
01:32:45,111 --> 01:32:46,388
still echo in our ear.

1076
01:32:48,390 --> 01:32:51,082
Peace on earth, 
goodwill toward men.

1077
01:32:53,153 --> 01:32:54,396
Merry Christmas, everyone.
