1
00:00:16,475 --> 00:00:18,352
Old man?

2
00:00:19,603 --> 00:00:21,480
Old man are you awake?

3
00:00:22,732 --> 00:00:24,608
Or are you sleeping?

4
00:00:26,193 --> 00:00:28,112
When I couldn't sleep,

5
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:31,741
my mom would tell me a story

6
00:00:34,076 --> 00:00:37,872
My favorite was about a wandering man

7
00:00:38,372 --> 00:00:40,499
who was lost

8
00:00:42,251 --> 00:00:44,920
After walking for a long time,

9
00:00:46,297 --> 00:00:48,924
he became tired and hungry.

10
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:53,554
Without food and water

11
00:00:53,596 --> 00:00:56,807
he thought he would die

12
00:00:57,516 --> 00:00:59,894
and would cry in pain.

13
00:01:00,936 --> 00:01:05,399
Then a rabbit that was passing by

14
00:01:05,441 --> 00:01:07,902
felt sorry for him

15
00:01:09,487 --> 00:01:11,906
and she offered herself as food,

16
00:01:12,406 --> 00:01:14,408
to save his life.

17
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:18,579
As a thank you,

18
00:01:19,622 --> 00:01:23,959
the man carved the image of the rabbit

19
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:28,172
on the moon

20
00:01:29,924 --> 00:01:31,926
so that she would be with him...

21
00:01:33,594 --> 00:01:35,596
...forever.

22
00:02:25,104 --> 00:02:26,981
Panties too?

23
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:29,108
Si.

24
00:03:30,127 --> 00:03:31,086
You looking for work?

25
00:03:31,128 --> 00:03:32,254
- Si.

26
00:03:32,296 --> 00:03:36,050
I've got three
hours, 12 dollars an hour.

27
00:03:36,091 --> 00:03:38,093
- Yeah, all of you guys.

28
00:04:10,834 --> 00:04:13,212
So this whole thing is coming down,

29
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:15,089
you can see that already came down,

30
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:17,049
we have to move everything out

31
00:04:17,091 --> 00:04:21,261
and anything metal, copper
or anything shiny basically,

32
00:04:22,846 --> 00:04:26,517
I want you to take that
out and put it here.

33
00:04:39,196 --> 00:04:41,198
Hi my love, how are you?

34
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:45,911
- Where are you?
What are you doing?

35
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:49,289
And the kids, how are they?

36
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,002
Do they ask abut me?

37
00:04:58,257 --> 00:05:00,259
How I miss their smiles...

38
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:06,932
- All this shit still has to,

39
00:05:06,974 --> 00:05:08,684
no, all this shit goes
now, everything has to go.

40
00:05:11,729 --> 00:05:13,731
How is Havana?

41
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:17,484
Did you get the package I sent you?

42
00:05:23,407 --> 00:05:26,785
The extra money is for you
to buy yourself something beautiful.

43
00:05:28,871 --> 00:05:30,873
I have a new job, it's in an office.

44
00:05:35,627 --> 00:05:37,629
They pay me more than before

45
00:05:45,304 --> 00:05:47,306
but it's a lot of hours and
the work is hard.

46
00:05:51,894 --> 00:05:53,896
But it's okay.

47
00:05:58,567 --> 00:06:00,569
Everything here is extreme.

48
00:06:02,321 --> 00:06:06,492
The weather is either too hot
or too cold; there is no in-between

49
00:06:10,245 --> 00:06:12,247
This place makes me
miss you so much.

50
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:21,507
I dreamt about you last night.

51
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:28,972
We were floating on the Almendares River.

52
00:06:32,476 --> 00:06:36,146
40,
that's a little more.

53
00:06:37,272 --> 00:06:39,274
You were looking at me with a strange look,

54
00:06:41,944 --> 00:06:42,861
Thanks man.

55
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:46,907
and you were silent for a while, but...

56
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:51,328
Garcias.

57
00:06:52,454 --> 00:06:54,456
He paid us well, didn't he?

58
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:58,001
He paid us shit.

59
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:00,754
you start to tell me softly...

60
00:07:03,549 --> 00:07:05,551
I'm still here.

61
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:08,262
I'm still here.

62
00:07:08,804 --> 00:07:10,806
Over and over again.

63
00:07:13,392 --> 00:07:15,394
And you were floating away...

64
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:27,781
... I swam toward you but the currents
would pull me farther away.

65
00:07:31,326 --> 00:07:35,289
I woke up in a panic, then was relieved because

66
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,752
it was only a dream.

67
00:07:53,891 --> 00:07:56,894
I brought more.

68
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:06,612
Look over here!

69
00:08:07,696 --> 00:08:09,698
I have so much more to tell you.

70
00:08:15,037 --> 00:08:19,041
In my spare time, I've been
taking care of hurt animals

71
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:23,462
until they recover.

72
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:25,714
Is anyone hungry?

73
00:08:25,756 --> 00:08:26,965
Yes.

74
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:38,352
And the girl?

75
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,522
Some take longer than others, but...

76
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,404
When they are better I let them go.

77
00:08:49,905 --> 00:08:51,907
Eat!

78
00:08:52,491 --> 00:08:54,493
You have to eat!

79
00:09:03,502 --> 00:09:06,505
Does anyone need to use the bathroom?

80
00:09:14,263 --> 00:09:16,265
There is one in particular

81
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,855
She's been with me longer than the rest.

82
00:09:25,607 --> 00:09:27,609
It's a kitten.

83
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:32,739
She's scared,

84
00:09:34,616 --> 00:09:37,953
but I think you would like her.

85
00:09:44,001 --> 00:09:46,003
It's getting late my love.

86
00:09:46,295 --> 00:09:48,297
I have to go

87
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:50,632
but I will dream of you.

88
00:09:51,842 --> 00:09:53,844
both of us in the river,

89
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:57,097
laughing, swimming, and floating

90
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:01,893
and with your sweet voice
you will say,

91
00:10:02,644 --> 00:10:04,646
I'm still here.

92
00:10:06,315 --> 00:10:08,317
I love you my love.

93
00:10:43,352 --> 00:10:44,644
Don't fuck with me.

94
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:46,730
How much longer?

95
00:10:46,772 --> 00:10:48,607
He says he almost has all the money.

96
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:49,858
Then I'll come and get her.

97
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,109
No, that wasn't the deal!

98
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:52,444
She's been here too long.

99
00:10:52,486 --> 00:10:56,031
She doesn't eat, she doesn't speak!
If something-

100
00:10:56,073 --> 00:10:57,824
- Relax! Calm down!

101
00:10:57,866 --> 00:11:00,369
She's scared, you know how kids are.

102
00:11:00,786 --> 00:11:02,788
She's fine.

103
00:11:04,081 --> 00:11:06,083
Look, keep, taking care of her here.

104
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:10,837
I'm going to pay you good money.

105
00:11:17,344 --> 00:11:19,346
I'll call you tomorrow!

106
00:11:37,531 --> 00:11:39,533
Are you okay, kitty?

107
00:11:41,618 --> 00:11:43,620
Do you need anything?

108
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:47,267
Can you hear me?

109
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:54,274
Are you cold, old man?

110
00:12:57,027 --> 00:12:59,029
Do you like the snow?

111
00:13:01,448 --> 00:13:03,450
I like it.

112
00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:06,453
I saw the snow once.

113
00:13:09,623 --> 00:13:11,625
My mom took me.

114
00:13:14,711 --> 00:13:16,713
She saved up money

115
00:13:19,257 --> 00:13:21,259
and took me to the mountains.

116
00:13:25,889 --> 00:13:27,891
When we got there,

117
00:13:29,351 --> 00:13:31,353
everything

118
00:13:32,395 --> 00:13:34,397
was covered in white snow.

119
00:13:37,901 --> 00:13:39,903
My mommy and me

120
00:13:40,529 --> 00:13:42,531
on top of the snow.

121
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:47,160
It was beautiful.

122
00:14:22,237 --> 00:14:24,239
A pack of cigarettes.

123
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:56,896
Do you have to use the bathroom?

124
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:06,406
What are you writing?

125
00:15:21,755 --> 00:15:24,674
Do you feel like walking around a little bit?

126
00:15:37,145 --> 00:15:39,147
Be careful.

127
00:15:47,781 --> 00:15:50,200
Do you like this place,
or do you miss Mexico?

128
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:53,286
I hate this place.

129
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:00,460
Your dad comes next week.

130
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:03,880
Does that make you happy?

131
00:16:08,718 --> 00:16:10,720
I don't know.

132
00:16:17,686 --> 00:16:19,688
You are lucky, you know that?

133
00:16:21,022 --> 00:16:25,026
When I was born in Cuba, my dad
had already left and I never met him

134
00:16:26,903 --> 00:16:30,323
I don't care now, but I did when
I was your age.

135
00:16:36,621 --> 00:16:38,623
Do you know your dad?

136
00:16:43,545 --> 00:16:45,547
I never met him.

137
00:16:48,049 --> 00:16:52,011
Even though he wasn't in your life,
I know he loves you a lot.

138
00:16:53,388 --> 00:16:55,390
Your dad really loves you.

139
00:17:05,275 --> 00:17:07,277
Look, it's beautiful.

140
00:17:34,137 --> 00:17:36,139
You see, it's easy.

141
00:17:40,977 --> 00:17:42,979
See? Give me another.

142
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:04,083
Do you like music?

143
00:18:12,717 --> 00:18:14,719
Do you like music, little cat?

144
00:18:17,555 --> 00:18:19,557
This is one of my favorites.

145
00:19:37,677 --> 00:19:39,679
I remember those days

146
00:19:42,015 --> 00:19:44,017
when all the kids from my block

147
00:19:48,021 --> 00:19:50,023
would come out of their houses

148
00:19:51,482 --> 00:19:53,484
and we would would play for hours.

149
00:19:57,196 --> 00:20:01,534
we'd forget about everything and everyone.

150
00:20:05,747 --> 00:20:07,749
It was like

151
00:20:09,751 --> 00:20:11,753
we were in a world

152
00:20:13,671 --> 00:20:15,673
that was only ours.

153
00:20:19,052 --> 00:20:21,054
We would sing.

154
00:20:24,182 --> 00:20:26,184
We would dance.

155
00:20:29,729 --> 00:20:31,731
Until I heard a voice

156
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:34,192
Cecilia!

157
00:20:36,778 --> 00:20:37,612
Cecilia!

158
00:20:38,529 --> 00:20:42,450
calling me because it was time for dinner.

159
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:46,621
Cecilia!

160
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,002
It was my mommy.

161
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:19,153
- Hello?

162
00:21:20,029 --> 00:21:22,031
Yes?

163
00:21:23,199 --> 00:21:25,201
When, today?

164
00:21:26,202 --> 00:21:28,204
What time?

165
00:21:29,831 --> 00:21:31,833
Okay, she will be ready.

166
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:14,500
Are you happy you will see your dad?

167
00:22:20,048 --> 00:22:20,882
Si, no?

168
00:22:23,634 --> 00:22:25,636
I don't know.

169
00:22:41,694 --> 00:22:43,696
Let's go.

170
00:22:44,697 --> 00:22:46,699
Don't be afraid.

171
00:22:55,208 --> 00:22:57,293
Remember what I told you.

172
00:22:57,335 --> 00:22:59,337
Your dad loves you a lot.

173
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:14,852
Hurry up!

174
00:24:21,419 --> 00:24:23,421
We'll be driving for a few hours.

175
00:24:29,594 --> 00:24:31,596
You want to sleep?

176
00:24:38,895 --> 00:24:40,897
Plans have changed,

177
00:24:42,398 --> 00:24:46,402
I have absolutely no idea
where your dad is.

178
00:24:48,404 --> 00:24:50,406
You are going to stay with me.

179
00:24:59,665 --> 00:25:01,667
Are you a mute?

180
00:25:08,007 --> 00:25:10,009
Kids, kids...

181
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:31,530
What are you looking at?

182
00:25:32,657 --> 00:25:33,491
- Hey.

183
00:25:38,746 --> 00:25:39,538
Hey.

184
00:25:44,126 --> 00:25:46,128
Nothing.

185
00:26:15,866 --> 00:26:17,868
Do you want to use the restroom?

186
00:26:21,998 --> 00:26:24,000
Are you sure?

187
00:26:33,968 --> 00:26:35,970
Stay here, I'll be back.

188
00:27:57,635 --> 00:28:01,055
My Love, I've been thinking about you tonight.

189
00:28:04,058 --> 00:28:06,060
You would like this place.

190
00:28:08,437 --> 00:28:10,439
There is so much to do
and so much to see.

191
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,322
I think you would like my friends.

192
00:28:22,326 --> 00:28:24,328
But I feel lonely.

193
00:28:25,037 --> 00:28:27,039
So lonely.

194
00:28:32,545 --> 00:28:34,547
I think of you to clear my thoughts.

195
00:28:42,346 --> 00:28:45,808
My love, I promise I will bring
you and the kids here soon.

196
00:28:59,029 --> 00:29:01,031
Come closer.

197
00:29:10,332 --> 00:29:12,334
Sing.

198
00:31:42,276 --> 00:31:44,278
Old man.

199
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:48,782
Old man.

200
00:31:52,161 --> 00:31:54,163
Are you awake?

201
00:31:56,582 --> 00:31:58,584
Are you sleeping?

202
00:32:00,294 --> 00:32:02,755
Wake up.

203
00:32:08,385 --> 00:32:10,387
Are you there?

204
00:32:16,977 --> 00:32:18,979
How is the snow?

205
00:32:27,488 --> 00:32:29,490
We had to go Old man.

206
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:36,121
My dad didn't show up.

207
00:32:38,707 --> 00:32:40,709
I don't know where he is.

208
00:32:45,881 --> 00:32:47,883
Did you hear me?

209
00:32:53,347 --> 00:32:55,349
Look outside.

210
00:32:57,601 --> 00:32:59,603
Do you see it?

211
00:33:02,064 --> 00:33:04,066
He is looking for us.

212
00:33:07,611 --> 00:33:09,613
The monster.

213
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:13,242
He kidnaps little girls.

214
00:33:16,078 --> 00:33:18,080
But don't worry old man,

215
00:33:20,666 --> 00:33:22,668
I'll take care of you.

216
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:27,172
Always.

217
00:35:36,385 --> 00:35:38,387
I'll be back old man.

218
00:39:26,782 --> 00:39:28,784
Hello.

219
00:39:31,995 --> 00:39:33,997
Are you hungry?

220
00:39:38,043 --> 00:39:40,045
What's your name?

221
00:39:48,345 --> 00:39:50,347
I will call you Pancho.

222
00:39:53,016 --> 00:39:55,018
You don't like it?

223
00:40:01,274 --> 00:40:03,276
I'll call you Panchito.

224
00:40:08,365 --> 00:40:10,367
Nice to meet you, Panchito.

225
00:40:11,952 --> 00:40:13,954
My name's Cecilia

226
00:41:56,348 --> 00:41:58,099
How many did you bring?

227
00:41:58,141 --> 00:41:59,434
Eight.

228
00:41:59,476 --> 00:42:00,560
Eight?

229
00:42:00,602 --> 00:42:01,895
Hey man, you said four or five.

230
00:42:01,937 --> 00:42:02,854
Calm down.

231
00:42:02,896 --> 00:42:04,898
It's more money for us.

232
00:42:07,442 --> 00:42:08,735
What happened to your eye?

233
00:42:08,777 --> 00:42:11,363
Nothing, just an accident.

234
00:42:11,404 --> 00:42:13,281
An accident?

235
00:42:18,245 --> 00:42:20,038
How did it go with the little girl?

236
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:21,373
I don't know, she ran off.

237
00:42:21,414 --> 00:42:23,375
What do you mean she ran off?

238
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:25,460
Calm down,
I'm just joking.

239
00:42:25,502 --> 00:42:26,503
Don't play games with me!

240
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:28,546
It was a joke. It's all right,
she's with her dad.

241
00:42:29,381 --> 00:42:31,383
There's nothing to worry about.

242
00:42:32,717 --> 00:42:34,719
Don't play with me.

243
00:42:36,471 --> 00:42:37,681
Open it.

244
00:42:37,722 --> 00:42:39,266
Hold on.

245
00:42:39,307 --> 00:42:40,350
I need a favor.

246
00:42:40,392 --> 00:42:41,643
What?

247
00:42:41,685 --> 00:42:42,435
A loan.

248
00:42:42,477 --> 00:42:43,979
From me?

249
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:44,854
Two thousand dollars.

250
00:42:46,273 --> 00:42:48,275
- Have you seen where I live?

251
00:42:48,316 --> 00:42:51,736
- Can you or can you not?
- Of Course I can't, you're crazy.

252
00:43:00,287 --> 00:43:02,289
Come on, get out.

253
00:43:02,914 --> 00:43:04,916
Be careful with your heads.

254
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:07,752
To the house.

255
00:43:09,754 --> 00:43:11,756
Careful.

256
00:43:28,356 --> 00:43:30,358
This is too many people, you know.

257
00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:34,321
I'll see you tomorrow.

258
00:43:58,303 --> 00:44:00,472
Cecilia.

259
00:44:14,277 --> 00:44:15,111
Ceci!

260
00:45:30,145 --> 00:45:32,147
Is that you papa?

261
00:45:56,421 --> 00:45:58,465
- I can go straight to the left?

262
00:45:58,506 --> 00:46:02,093
Yeah, it'll take you
about four more miles.

263
00:46:20,945 --> 00:46:22,322
Hello, Panchito.

264
00:46:22,363 --> 00:46:24,782
Are you thirtsy?

265
00:46:30,747 --> 00:46:32,749
Do you want some water Panchito?

266
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:36,753
Here.

267
00:49:31,803 --> 00:49:33,805
Old man,

268
00:49:34,389 --> 00:49:36,391
I have something to tell you.

269
00:49:39,268 --> 00:49:42,021
Today

270
00:49:44,315 --> 00:49:46,317
I saw the savior.

271
00:49:50,196 --> 00:49:52,198
Did you hear that?

272
00:49:57,829 --> 00:49:59,831
-Stay quiet old man!

273
00:50:04,877 --> 00:50:06,879
It won't hear us.

274
00:50:20,309 --> 00:50:22,478
Cecilia.

275
00:50:40,204 --> 00:50:43,332
- What about the rest of them?
- They haven't paid me yet

276
00:50:51,674 --> 00:50:53,676
-What about the loan?

277
00:50:54,886 --> 00:50:56,888
-Do I look like a bank?

278
00:50:57,930 --> 00:50:59,932
-It's only two thousand dollars.

279
00:51:00,641 --> 00:51:02,643
-Only?

280
00:51:04,103 --> 00:51:06,105
-And why do you need so much money?

281
00:51:08,107 --> 00:51:10,109
-Business.

282
00:51:31,631 --> 00:51:33,508
That was last month.

283
00:51:33,549 --> 00:51:34,884
- Can I use the bathroom?
- Yeah.

284
00:51:34,926 --> 00:51:37,720
Yeah, of course, you know the way.

285
00:51:38,763 --> 00:51:42,183
Yeah, no, no, just does some work for me.

286
00:53:42,678 --> 00:53:44,680
Are you through in there?

287
00:53:44,722 --> 00:53:45,681
We gotta go!

288
00:53:45,723 --> 00:53:47,725
On my way!

289
00:54:02,198 --> 00:54:04,200
Old man,

290
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:14,502
How do you feel?

291
00:54:21,926 --> 00:54:23,928
You look sad.

292
00:54:33,562 --> 00:54:35,564
When I'd get sad,

293
00:54:41,028 --> 00:54:43,030
my mom would tell me a story

294
00:54:50,621 --> 00:54:52,623
about a boy and a tree.

295
00:55:00,339 --> 00:55:02,341
The tree loved the boy so much.

296
00:55:05,845 --> 00:55:07,847
She would give her leaves

297
00:55:08,973 --> 00:55:10,975
and her branches to the boy

298
00:55:12,226 --> 00:55:14,228
So that he would be happy.

299
00:55:20,192 --> 00:55:22,153
But one day,

300
00:55:23,362 --> 00:55:25,364
the boy was not satisfied

301
00:55:26,323 --> 00:55:28,325
and stopped visiting the tree.

302
00:55:30,745 --> 00:55:34,749
When we were in the hotel room
coming here, I started thinking about

303
00:55:35,875 --> 00:55:40,421
everything I was leaving behind
and I started to cry

304
00:55:45,342 --> 00:55:47,344
I was leaving it all for a better life,

305
00:55:49,555 --> 00:55:53,559
but it was sad for me to think
of my friends and family.

306
00:55:55,227 --> 00:55:59,231
I wanted to help my mom and dad,
but I never had any money.

307
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:02,902
So I had to

308
00:56:03,486 --> 00:56:06,822
look for a better life in a different place.

309
00:56:07,615 --> 00:56:09,617
In a different part of the world.

310
00:56:18,417 --> 00:56:20,419
The tree was so sad.

311
00:56:27,843 --> 00:56:29,845
The boy grew

312
00:56:31,972 --> 00:56:33,974
until he turned into a man.

313
00:56:39,563 --> 00:56:42,566
He'd come back only when
he needed something.

314
00:56:51,534 --> 00:56:53,536
Until one day,

315
00:56:54,620 --> 00:56:57,039
the tree was left with nothing.

316
00:57:05,714 --> 00:57:08,717
- Only a stump was left.
Dried up.

317
00:57:12,596 --> 00:57:14,598
Nothing was left.

318
00:57:18,018 --> 00:57:20,020
Nothing.

319
00:58:16,994 --> 00:58:19,163
Cecilia.

320
00:58:31,842 --> 00:58:32,676
Cecilia.

321
00:58:46,899 --> 00:58:48,901
- You won't regret that
you came, asshole.

322
00:58:50,694 --> 00:58:52,696
-We'll split it half and half.

323
00:58:57,785 --> 00:58:59,787
- There's a lot of money in this place.

324
00:59:04,625 --> 00:59:06,627
- And how do you know that?

325
00:59:09,004 --> 00:59:11,006
- I do business with these people.

326
00:59:18,764 --> 00:59:20,766
- Business.

327
00:59:24,186 --> 00:59:26,188
- Last time I was there, i took this.

328
00:59:29,858 --> 00:59:31,860
- They didn't even notice.

329
00:59:50,879 --> 00:59:53,757
Cecilia.

330
00:59:55,134 --> 00:59:57,177
I've been looking for you Cecilia.

331
01:00:01,765 --> 01:00:03,767
Come to me Cecilia.

332
01:00:06,645 --> 01:00:08,647
Why didn't you want to see me?

333
01:00:10,816 --> 01:00:13,819
Why don't you want
to see me, Cecilia?

334
01:00:14,653 --> 01:00:16,655
I don't know you.

335
01:00:17,656 --> 01:00:20,659
The come and meet me
Cecilia. Come in.

336
01:01:46,328 --> 01:01:48,330
They're leaving.

337
01:01:51,291 --> 01:01:54,294
Alright, you ready? Honk twice if someone is coming.

338
01:02:51,894 --> 01:02:53,896
Don't fuck with me.

339
01:02:57,858 --> 01:02:59,860
Don't fuck with me.

340
01:03:06,283 --> 01:03:08,285
Hurry up, hurry up.

341
01:03:38,899 --> 01:03:40,901
You are not my papa.

342
01:04:25,779 --> 01:04:27,781
Don't worry old man,

343
01:04:30,701 --> 01:04:32,703
it wasn't him.

344
01:04:41,253 --> 01:04:43,255
You sleep well.

345
01:05:03,275 --> 01:05:04,943
- Wake up asshole! Hurry up!

346
01:05:04,985 --> 01:05:06,486
-What happened?

347
01:05:06,528 --> 01:05:07,529
-Nothing
-What did you get?

348
01:05:07,571 --> 01:05:09,990
- Nothing!
-What you mean nothing!?

349
01:05:10,032 --> 01:05:12,034
-They didn't have shit in there!

350
01:05:59,956 --> 01:06:01,375
- Can I help you?

351
01:06:05,962 --> 01:06:07,964
- Can I help you?

352
01:06:11,009 --> 01:06:13,011
- Things cost money.

353
01:06:15,430 --> 01:06:17,432
-You understand?

354
01:06:19,101 --> 01:06:21,103
-You understand?

355
01:06:23,939 --> 01:06:25,941
- I'm watching you.

356
01:06:26,650 --> 01:06:28,819
I saw you little girl!

357
01:06:28,860 --> 01:06:30,779
You got that?

358
01:06:30,821 --> 01:06:32,823
- I saw you!

359
01:09:30,125 --> 01:09:31,001
- Gracias.

360
01:13:38,748 --> 01:13:41,751
What happened old man?

361
01:14:27,172 --> 01:14:29,174
Dear Francisco, How are you?

362
01:14:30,592 --> 01:14:32,594
I hope this letter finds you well.

363
01:14:35,471 --> 01:14:38,558
I've been wanting to write you for months,

364
01:14:38,600 --> 01:14:41,644
but there are things I'm still trying
to understand in my life without you.

365
01:14:48,443 --> 01:14:50,445
I've been thinking about
when we first met.

366
01:14:52,488 --> 01:14:54,490
- Two kids in love

367
01:14:55,825 --> 01:14:57,827
- with a passion to change the world.

368
01:14:58,703 --> 01:15:00,705
- Or at least our world in Havana

369
01:15:03,499 --> 01:15:05,501
- But you left.

370
01:15:05,752 --> 01:15:07,462
- You left me, my love.

371
01:15:07,503 --> 01:15:08,880
- Your children,

372
01:15:08,922 --> 01:15:10,840
- and your country.

373
01:15:12,842 --> 01:15:15,803
- Our views of this place
have always been different,

374
01:15:18,348 --> 01:15:20,350
- that never changed.

375
01:15:20,892 --> 01:15:22,894
- But you did

376
01:15:24,479 --> 01:15:27,482
- You left everything that was important to you

377
01:15:28,900 --> 01:15:30,902
- with a promise of something better.

378
01:15:31,903 --> 01:15:33,821
- a better life?

379
01:15:33,863 --> 01:15:35,865
I'll bring you more tomorrow.

380
01:15:37,283 --> 01:15:39,285
Is your life better without me?

381
01:15:42,705 --> 01:15:44,707
Maybe it's like a dream,

382
01:15:46,501 --> 01:15:48,503
- like us floating in the river

383
01:15:50,463 --> 01:15:52,382
- whispering,

384
01:15:52,423 --> 01:15:54,425
- I'm still here.

385
01:16:00,807 --> 01:16:04,143
- At this point, all I have left is the
sound of your voice in my memory.

386
01:16:07,814 --> 01:16:09,983
Cecilia!

387
01:16:11,943 --> 01:16:13,945
Leave without me, Cecilia!

388
01:16:16,823 --> 01:16:18,825
You'll be okay.

389
01:16:21,703 --> 01:16:23,705
Leave without me, Cecilia!

390
01:16:24,414 --> 01:16:25,248
Cecilia.

391
01:16:28,584 --> 01:16:29,419
Cecilia!

392
01:16:33,631 --> 01:16:35,633
- You're going to be okay. I'll stay here!

393
01:16:36,801 --> 01:16:37,635
- Mamma?

394
01:16:43,516 --> 01:16:45,518
- Leave my love. They're waiting for you!

395
01:16:45,560 --> 01:16:46,769
Mamma!

396
01:16:47,228 --> 01:16:49,230
- You'll be okay!

397
01:16:51,691 --> 01:16:53,151
Cecilia!

398
01:17:02,785 --> 01:17:04,787
- You'll be okay

399
01:17:17,675 --> 01:17:19,677
I can't wait any longer my love.

400
01:17:21,179 --> 01:17:23,181
- Your boys are almost men now.

401
01:17:24,182 --> 01:17:27,393
- You're just a face in old
photographs to them.

402
01:17:29,479 --> 01:17:31,481
- And now, to me.

403
01:17:31,939 --> 01:17:34,942
- This is not how I imagined things would end,

404
01:17:36,986 --> 01:17:40,615
but our communication is almost like a ghost.

405
01:17:44,619 --> 01:17:46,621
- Pieces of paper,

406
01:17:47,997 --> 01:17:49,999
- broken promises.

407
01:17:55,421 --> 01:17:57,423
- I wish you the best

408
01:17:57,840 --> 01:18:00,843
- with your life, with your love,

409
01:18:01,386 --> 01:18:03,388
- with your dream.

410
01:18:05,264 --> 01:18:08,393
- I say all of this knowing
well that I will miss you,

411
01:18:10,353 --> 01:18:12,355
- in the same way the boys miss you,

412
01:18:13,439 --> 01:18:15,441
- the way Havana misses you.

413
01:18:17,151 --> 01:18:19,153
- Always, with love,

414
01:18:20,738 --> 01:18:22,740
- Claudia
