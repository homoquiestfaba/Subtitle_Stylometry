2
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:46,774
Happy birthday, son.

3
00:01:47,065 --> 00:01:48,442
Happy birthday.

4
00:01:48,734 --> 00:01:50,031
Cake before dinner?

5
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:51,946
Well, it's your
brother's big day,

6
00:01:51,971 --> 00:01:53,131
let's let him decide.

7
00:01:53,525 --> 00:01:55,027
Then I decide on... cake!

8
00:01:55,459 --> 00:01:56,756
Cake it is.

9
00:01:57,092 --> 00:01:57,593
Really?

10
00:01:57,625 --> 00:01:58,091
Sure.

11
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:00,939
Yeah. I don't suppose it'll
kill you just this once.

12
00:02:01,747 --> 00:02:03,249
Okay, blow out the candles

13
00:02:03,911 --> 00:02:05,584
before we burn
the house down.

14
00:02:05,609 --> 00:02:07,111
How many are there?

15
00:02:07,294 --> 00:02:09,012
Why don't you count 'em?

16
00:02:10,339 --> 00:02:12,262
8, 9, 10.

17
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:15,894
10 years old and one
to grow on, 11.

18
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:16,841
That's right.

19
00:02:16,866 --> 00:02:18,811
10 years old.
And one to grow on.

20
00:04:07,694 --> 00:04:10,038
Wake up. Wake up.
Wake up. Wake up.

21
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:12,419
Do exactly as I say.

22
00:04:12,444 --> 00:04:14,446
Alex, Alex...

23
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:16,613
Alex, Alex!

24
00:04:17,132 --> 00:04:19,134
Come on.

25
00:04:22,764 --> 00:04:24,766
Do exactly as I say.

26
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:28,067
Okay, here we go.

27
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:31,355
Here, take your robe.

28
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:37,535
Come on.

29
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:43,162
Get the door.
Get the door.

30
00:04:46,382 --> 00:04:48,305
In the truck.

31
00:04:59,416 --> 00:05:01,168
Go on.

32
00:05:11,297 --> 00:05:13,766
Stay back!
Leave us alone!

33
00:05:17,217 --> 00:05:20,266
Boys, stay in the truck.

34
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:29,504
You don't want
to do this.

35
00:05:29,856 --> 00:05:32,694
Look... it's not you.
Stop!

36
00:05:36,612 --> 00:05:39,582
Don't do this!
Don't do this!

37
00:09:16,865 --> 00:09:18,412
Check.

38
00:09:24,211 --> 00:09:25,545
Can't do it.

39
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,822
Mate.

40
00:09:29,584 --> 00:09:31,123
Fucked again!

41
00:09:32,686 --> 00:09:35,701
Without even the courtesy
of a reach around.

42
00:09:48,121 --> 00:09:50,685
It's been a business doing
pleasure with you, my friend.

43
00:09:52,102 --> 00:09:53,194
Who's next?

44
00:09:54,134 --> 00:09:56,728
Come on, girls,
don't be shy.

45
00:09:57,052 --> 00:09:59,020
What about you, sugar?

46
00:10:01,506 --> 00:10:05,313
Hope you have some change in
your pocket for a metrocard.

47
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:06,982
Come on.

48
00:10:08,279 --> 00:10:10,654
You two girls
have fun, now.

49
00:10:11,389 --> 00:10:14,959
I'm gonna go find me some
respect somewhere else.

50
00:10:14,984 --> 00:10:15,906
Come on.

51
00:10:17,121 --> 00:10:18,213
See you.

52
00:10:29,671 --> 00:10:31,344
Hit the timer.

53
00:10:50,274 --> 00:10:52,381
Well, that sucked.

54
00:10:53,292 --> 00:10:54,826
It's game over.

55
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:01,709
Forget it.

56
00:11:05,797 --> 00:11:07,412
Harry Jellenik.

57
00:11:08,293 --> 00:11:09,545
Alex Borden.

58
00:11:13,646 --> 00:11:15,123
You okay?

59
00:11:16,201 --> 00:11:17,849
Yeah, yeah.

60
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:19,584
It's a migraine,
i guess.

61
00:11:21,264 --> 00:11:24,178
Well, you keep at it,
young Alex.

62
00:11:32,763 --> 00:11:34,268
Good-bye, Alex.

63
00:12:56,083 --> 00:12:59,508
Hey! Don't do that!
Why do you do that?

64
00:12:59,654 --> 00:13:00,780
My dream.

65
00:13:01,243 --> 00:13:03,318
It tried to get
me in my dream.

66
00:13:03,671 --> 00:13:05,765
I hurt him so he's
too weak to come after us.

67
00:13:06,353 --> 00:13:07,708
You've seen them, too?

68
00:13:07,733 --> 00:13:09,235
I don't want to talk
about it. Okay?

69
00:13:09,838 --> 00:13:11,435
If dad finds out this
is happening again,

70
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:12,803
he'll send us away
from each other.

71
00:13:13,449 --> 00:13:15,443
Do you want
that to happen? Huh?

72
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:18,514
Thought so.

73
00:13:19,016 --> 00:13:20,685
Then keep
your mouth shut.

74
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:22,277
Promise?

75
00:13:22,306 --> 00:13:23,307
Promise.

76
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:26,397
We need to stick
together. Okay?

77
00:13:26,423 --> 00:13:30,053
As long as I'm here, I won't let
anything happen to you, Alex.

78
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,841
HELLOOO?

79
00:13:56,779 --> 00:13:58,114
Alex.

80
00:13:59,896 --> 00:14:01,303
Jason?

81
00:14:01,591 --> 00:14:02,646
How did you get in?

82
00:14:02,671 --> 00:14:04,239
Your door is wide open.

83
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,183
I thought
somebody broke in.

84
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:09,803
I expected to find some lunatic
raping your lifeless corpse.

85
00:14:09,828 --> 00:14:12,251
Yes. Yeah. That would be
what you'd think.

86
00:14:13,901 --> 00:14:15,403
What are you doing here?

87
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:17,642
This is where I live.

88
00:14:17,667 --> 00:14:19,169
No. This is where
you house-sit.

89
00:14:19,403 --> 00:14:23,138
I brought these back.
Stacy's in the car. Smoke?

90
00:14:25,907 --> 00:14:27,700
No?... 'Course not.

91
00:14:39,867 --> 00:14:41,000
What's that?

92
00:14:41,323 --> 00:14:45,248
It's "secrets of modern chess
strategy advances since NIMZOWITSCH."

93
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:47,474
You hate chess.

94
00:14:48,735 --> 00:14:49,530
I know.

95
00:14:49,814 --> 00:14:51,063
So...?

96
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:52,469
So, I don't know.

97
00:14:52,494 --> 00:14:54,961
Something like, something
like happened today.

98
00:14:54,986 --> 00:14:57,865
I got home and I'm flipping
through every book in the house.

99
00:14:58,489 --> 00:15:00,583
And, here...

100
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:02,711
Take this one. This is
a real page Turner.

101
00:15:02,736 --> 00:15:04,158
I read it an hour ago.

102
00:15:04,393 --> 00:15:06,191
You finished it an hour ago?

103
00:15:06,216 --> 00:15:08,446
No, no. I read it
an hour ago.

104
00:15:11,973 --> 00:15:13,099
Yeah...

105
00:15:18,088 --> 00:15:19,180
Yikes!

106
00:15:19,205 --> 00:15:21,253
When do the Klausners
get back?

107
00:15:21,634 --> 00:15:22,760
In the fall.

108
00:15:22,785 --> 00:15:25,413
Who vacations in Rwanda?

109
00:15:25,823 --> 00:15:26,915
I don't know,

110
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:28,328
but it beats
unemployment.

111
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:30,617
Would you stop touching
the things, please?

112
00:15:33,305 --> 00:15:36,141
I don't think you can call
house-sitting employment.

113
00:15:37,391 --> 00:15:39,946
Alex, with a brain like yours,

114
00:15:40,093 --> 00:15:43,939
you should have a job
with NASA or, you know,

115
00:15:44,058 --> 00:15:47,312
one of those companies that
hires really smart people.

116
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:49,244
Yeah.

117
00:15:53,578 --> 00:15:54,750
Headache?

118
00:15:56,075 --> 00:15:57,406
Yeah, it's...

119
00:15:58,519 --> 00:15:59,601
Do me a favor.

120
00:15:59,626 --> 00:16:03,256
Lay off the speed reading.
I gotta go. Stacy's waiting.

121
00:16:06,416 --> 00:16:07,838
I'll see you later, okay?

122
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:15,099
Alex?

123
00:16:15,901 --> 00:16:17,528
Oh, god.

124
00:16:18,404 --> 00:16:21,356
Alex?
Wake up, man.

125
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:23,873
Alex! Alex!

126
00:16:47,925 --> 00:16:51,520
Ira, right now,
medically, he's fine.

127
00:16:52,272 --> 00:16:56,190
The curvature is completely
unbroken, inside and out.

128
00:16:56,334 --> 00:16:57,663
Look, if I'm reading
this correctly,

129
00:16:57,688 --> 00:17:01,061
this kid uses more of his frontal lobe
for cognitive activity than anybody

130
00:17:01,086 --> 00:17:03,889
who has ever been charted.

131
00:17:04,906 --> 00:17:06,453
You can't release him,
sweetheart.

132
00:17:06,593 --> 00:17:09,914
No, this chart alone is worth tens
of thousands in study grants.

133
00:17:10,464 --> 00:17:12,558
What choice do I have?

134
00:17:13,338 --> 00:17:15,328
I have no basis
for keeping him.

135
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:20,586
I suppose a postmortem analysis
is out of the question.

136
00:17:21,696 --> 00:17:23,711
Is that supposed
to be funny, ira?

137
00:17:29,954 --> 00:17:32,148
Hey, buddy,
what you got there?

138
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:38,367
My head
is killing me.

139
00:17:38,528 --> 00:17:41,023
Well, that's inaccurate
and quite impossible.

140
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:42,906
What I don't doubt
is that you've had

141
00:17:42,931 --> 00:17:44,855
a mild to mildly
severe head trauma.

142
00:17:45,449 --> 00:17:49,079
So what I need to do is give
you a cognitive assessment.

143
00:17:49,347 --> 00:17:51,441
Then I'll poke a few holes
in your skull.

144
00:17:51,810 --> 00:17:52,811
Holes?

145
00:17:53,266 --> 00:17:55,500
Metaphorically speaking,
of course.

146
00:17:55,707 --> 00:17:57,584
We'll start off with
the easy first test.

147
00:17:57,923 --> 00:17:58,719
Okay?

148
00:17:59,078 --> 00:17:59,795
Okay.

149
00:18:00,141 --> 00:18:03,492
Okay. Look very
carefully at this chart.

150
00:18:05,391 --> 00:18:09,352
Try to remember as much as
you can about what you see.

151
00:18:12,992 --> 00:18:15,053
Alright. How many of the
pictures can you remember?

152
00:18:15,078 --> 00:18:16,751
In alphabetical order-
apple, ball, cat, dog,

153
00:18:16,776 --> 00:18:18,438
egg, fire truck,
grasshopper, hat,

154
00:18:18,463 --> 00:18:20,664
ice cream cone, jump rope,
kangaroo, light bulb...

155
00:18:22,797 --> 00:18:24,430
Well, that's fine.

156
00:18:26,109 --> 00:18:27,617
What was that?

157
00:18:28,578 --> 00:18:30,406
Why don't you tell me?

158
00:18:32,273 --> 00:18:35,856
Calculate the following-a plane
flying the 3,458 mile distance

159
00:18:35,945 --> 00:18:38,781
from New York City to London
has a 50-mile-an-hour tail wind.

160
00:18:38,806 --> 00:18:41,304
The plane's point of no
return is 1,489 miles.

161
00:18:41,407 --> 00:18:42,875
Give or take
a hundred yards.

162
00:18:44,706 --> 00:18:46,578
I didn't even
finish the question.

163
00:19:16,585 --> 00:19:18,391
Well, in layman's terms...

164
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:21,445
You're getting smarter.

165
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:23,963
The part of your brain
that you use for cognition,

166
00:19:23,988 --> 00:19:25,661
it's just off the charts.

167
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:31,062
When we ran the test, it
showed your brain's activity.

168
00:19:31,462 --> 00:19:34,977
Other than the blackouts, you
seem to be in perfect health.

169
00:19:35,267 --> 00:19:37,770
None of this
solves my problem.

170
00:19:37,795 --> 00:19:39,263
What if it
happens again?

171
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:42,018
Do you have any idea
what you could do,

172
00:19:42,173 --> 00:19:46,648
if you harnessed even a fraction
of your intellectual potential?

173
00:19:46,673 --> 00:19:48,188
Do I even care about
that right now?

174
00:19:48,213 --> 00:19:51,727
God, you sound like that geeky
friend of yours, Doctor, uh...

175
00:19:51,799 --> 00:19:52,585
Dr. Gold.

176
00:19:52,610 --> 00:19:54,508
Yeah. You know, and
i don't like his idea

177
00:19:54,533 --> 00:19:56,016
of "postmortem
analysis."

178
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:57,844
It's not that
kind of hospital.

179
00:19:59,742 --> 00:20:02,586
Don't tell me the thought
didn't cross his mind.

180
00:20:03,019 --> 00:20:04,164
I heard him.

181
00:20:07,258 --> 00:20:09,820
You heard him
during the scan?

182
00:20:10,362 --> 00:20:11,891
I heard a lot of stuff.

183
00:20:20,114 --> 00:20:21,240
Alex.

184
00:20:21,681 --> 00:20:22,659
Look, it's a long shot,

185
00:20:22,684 --> 00:20:25,237
but I have a colleague
who's doing some research

186
00:20:25,262 --> 00:20:26,501
that might help you.

187
00:20:27,352 --> 00:20:28,966
It's worth a try.

188
00:20:31,312 --> 00:20:33,164
Right now, I might
try anything.

189
00:20:48,873 --> 00:20:51,126
I think this is the place.

190
00:20:56,719 --> 00:20:57,882
Hey, we'll keep you
in our prayers. Okay?

191
00:20:57,907 --> 00:20:59,679
Hey, you want us
to wait for you?

192
00:20:59,921 --> 00:21:01,012
No, than ks.
It's alright.

193
00:21:01,037 --> 00:21:02,155
Sure?
Yeah.

194
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:04,766
Take care of yourself.
God bless.

195
00:21:05,031 --> 00:21:06,658
God bless.

196
00:21:12,015 --> 00:21:13,938
Alex Borden? I'm Dr. Murphy.

197
00:21:14,319 --> 00:21:16,162
I don't know
how much Denise-

198
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:18,448
Dr. bell-has told
you about my book.

199
00:21:18,473 --> 00:21:20,191
She just said that
i should see you.

200
00:21:20,683 --> 00:21:22,856
She must have told you i
don't have insurance.

201
00:21:22,881 --> 00:21:24,599
It's not about money.

202
00:21:25,459 --> 00:21:28,397
You let me document your
progress with these sessions,

203
00:21:28,422 --> 00:21:32,241
anonymously, of course, and
I'll treat you free of charge.

204
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:34,130
What's this book
you're writing?

205
00:21:34,975 --> 00:21:37,788
It's a study of people who,
in simple terms,

206
00:21:37,813 --> 00:21:43,411
have found the switch that turns on
the dormant portions of their brains.

207
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:46,491
We're documenting the ways
in which it affects them.

208
00:21:47,026 --> 00:21:49,825
Migraines, night terrors,

209
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:52,124
spontaneous knowledge,
visions...

210
00:21:52,421 --> 00:21:55,164
Some people even swear
they hear voices.

211
00:21:55,452 --> 00:21:57,413
Well, some people
are crazy.

212
00:21:57,587 --> 00:22:00,090
Do th ese symptoms
sound familiar to you?

213
00:22:00,957 --> 00:22:02,874
Can you help me or not?

214
00:22:03,248 --> 00:22:06,923
Alex, if even half
of what Denise has told me

215
00:22:06,948 --> 00:22:08,850
about you is accurate,

216
00:22:09,304 --> 00:22:12,149
you're unlike anyone I've ever studied.

217
00:22:12,973 --> 00:22:15,601
Your case would
take priority.

218
00:22:15,626 --> 00:22:18,880
Just promise, you'll
make the pain go away.

219
00:22:19,412 --> 00:22:23,679
Whatever it takes,
i promise I'll try.

220
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:30,280
I've been doing it ever since
i was a little kid, I guess.

221
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:35,955
Lie down, focus on
a point above...

222
00:22:36,335 --> 00:22:39,491
Clear my head of all the stuff
crashing around inside.

223
00:22:40,301 --> 00:22:44,272
And I just...
Go somewhere.

224
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:48,452
It's all I ever wanted,
was to go away.

225
00:22:49,784 --> 00:22:52,218
And I found out
how to do it.

226
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:06,177
Why didn't you tell
anyone back then?

227
00:23:06,858 --> 00:23:09,210
Who could I trust
besides my brother?

228
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:15,984
And that'll do it
for me today, gentlemen.

229
00:23:16,963 --> 00:23:18,702
One more game?

230
00:23:20,413 --> 00:23:22,781
I'll make it quick
and painless for you.

231
00:23:22,806 --> 00:23:23,853
Is that right?

232
00:23:24,481 --> 00:23:25,528
Hey!

233
00:23:25,566 --> 00:23:26,818
I've been waiting
almost two hours

234
00:23:26,843 --> 00:23:31,179
to win my money back.
Wait your turn, kid.

235
00:23:31,507 --> 00:23:34,749
And what makes you think today
is going to be any different?

236
00:23:36,281 --> 00:23:37,667
Bitch.

237
00:23:37,692 --> 00:23:38,867
Harry!

238
00:24:39,353 --> 00:24:41,731
You really want
that game, huh?

239
00:25:29,995 --> 00:25:33,052
How... how do you
live with these?

240
00:25:33,732 --> 00:25:35,234
You paint what you know.

241
00:25:37,564 --> 00:25:41,325
So... people, like...
Buy these things?

242
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:45,403
Beer?

243
00:25:46,237 --> 00:25:47,419
Yeah.

244
00:25:57,693 --> 00:25:59,223
You gonna stand
there all day?

245
00:26:03,771 --> 00:26:06,083
Or are we gonna
play some chess?

246
00:26:22,562 --> 00:26:25,473
I don't usually have
strangers up in my studio.

247
00:26:28,136 --> 00:26:29,433
Hit the timer.

248
00:26:35,504 --> 00:26:37,472
You know you're
never gonna beat me.

249
00:26:38,954 --> 00:26:39,955
I'll beat you.

250
00:26:40,325 --> 00:26:43,955
Maybe not today,
but I will beat you.

251
00:26:47,981 --> 00:26:49,651
That's mate.

252
00:26:49,676 --> 00:26:52,231
Oh! That really,
really sucks.

253
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:54,778
You know, in the future,
you may want to consider

254
00:26:54,803 --> 00:26:57,934
castling your king, because it
tends to prolong the game.

255
00:27:00,391 --> 00:27:01,608
Yeah.

256
00:27:04,995 --> 00:27:06,667
What are those for?

257
00:27:08,113 --> 00:27:11,567
My nutritionist told me they thought
they'd put hair on my chest.

258
00:27:13,374 --> 00:27:16,674
And, uh... what do you
think about that?

259
00:27:21,483 --> 00:27:23,406
I think he's full of shit.

260
00:27:33,016 --> 00:27:34,463
Have a good day.

261
00:27:45,825 --> 00:27:46,924
Okay...

262
00:28:07,895 --> 00:28:10,614
Oh... sorry.
I come back.

263
00:28:10,639 --> 00:28:13,291
That's al-it's okay,
it's okay. Go ahead.

264
00:28:37,629 --> 00:28:38,854
Thank you.

265
00:28:43,961 --> 00:28:44,928
Okay.

266
00:30:13,854 --> 00:30:15,652
Jason! Stacy!

267
00:30:15,939 --> 00:30:17,038
You there?

268
00:34:06,915 --> 00:34:09,418
<i>Dr. Ira Gold
was found mutilated.</i>

269
00:35:46,949 --> 00:35:48,747
In our last session
you mentioned

270
00:35:48,772 --> 00:35:49,819
that something
strange happened

271
00:35:49,844 --> 00:35:51,938
in the ambulance
on the way to the hospital.

272
00:35:52,546 --> 00:35:54,014
You want to
tell me about it?

273
00:35:57,426 --> 00:35:58,887
It's hard to explain.

274
00:35:59,595 --> 00:36:02,064
I remember them, like,
trying to save me.

275
00:36:02,815 --> 00:36:05,238
I was out cold,
but I could hear them.

276
00:36:05,513 --> 00:36:06,765
And somehow...

277
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:08,058
See them.

278
00:36:08,645 --> 00:36:11,148
I could smell what Charlie
had eaten for lunch.

279
00:36:11,323 --> 00:36:12,433
Charlie?

280
00:36:12,543 --> 00:36:13,795
The ems guy.

281
00:36:14,477 --> 00:36:17,105
I don't know how I know that,
but I know that's his name.

282
00:36:17,717 --> 00:36:18,639
Go on.

283
00:36:18,927 --> 00:36:20,099
I could see Alice...

284
00:36:20,152 --> 00:36:22,905
The ambulance driver,
behind CHARLIE'S back.

285
00:36:23,787 --> 00:36:25,209
She kept a bag of weed

286
00:36:25,234 --> 00:36:26,644
under the passenger
seat for when

287
00:36:26,669 --> 00:36:28,797
things on the shift
got intense.

288
00:36:30,196 --> 00:36:33,519
Isn't it possible that because
of your accident, just maybe...

289
00:36:33,544 --> 00:36:35,480
What?
I dreamed it? No.

290
00:36:35,877 --> 00:36:37,902
Call the hospital if you want,
ask what their names were.

291
00:36:37,927 --> 00:36:40,421
Or, better yet, go down
there, roll a joint.

292
00:36:40,637 --> 00:36:41,916
Maybe share some
with Dr. gold.

293
00:36:41,941 --> 00:36:43,746
Oh, wait, he's dead.

294
00:36:49,873 --> 00:36:51,223
Tell me when to stop.

295
00:36:51,248 --> 00:36:53,527
Tell me when to stop.

296
00:36:55,186 --> 00:36:56,233
Stop.

297
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:14,277
Ask me what's
in the book.

298
00:37:15,573 --> 00:37:16,863
Go ahead.
Ask me.

299
00:37:21,865 --> 00:37:24,762
"A survey of
702 clubs found-"

300
00:37:24,787 --> 00:37:27,606
"that almost 70% met in saloons or
neighborhood halls that sold liquor."

301
00:37:28,824 --> 00:37:30,192
Ask me another one.

302
00:37:30,824 --> 00:37:31,980
Jesus.

303
00:37:39,315 --> 00:37:42,684
Well, look who
the wind blew in.

304
00:37:42,987 --> 00:37:45,082
You had to come looking
for him, didn't you?

305
00:37:45,676 --> 00:37:46,949
Free country.

306
00:37:49,005 --> 00:37:52,012
Next time you want to play
Harry, you go through us.

307
00:37:56,733 --> 00:37:57,825
Where is he?

308
00:37:58,218 --> 00:38:00,003
He's probably home
counting his money.

309
00:38:00,028 --> 00:38:02,907
He's probably at the empire
luncheonette on Avenue b.

310
00:38:03,629 --> 00:38:04,676
Thanks.

311
00:38:05,019 --> 00:38:06,238
Believe me...

312
00:38:06,263 --> 00:38:07,515
You're not welcome.

313
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:09,426
You can play us next time.

314
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:10,981
Deal.

315
00:38:12,156 --> 00:38:15,863
Ooh! What else have you
been doing with that hand?

316
00:40:23,212 --> 00:40:25,275
Ah, chess is good.

317
00:40:28,451 --> 00:40:30,564
What shall we eat tonight?

318
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:33,627
Hmm, where are
you taking Sammy?

319
00:40:33,772 --> 00:40:36,166
Someone did well
for himself today.

320
00:40:37,054 --> 00:40:38,271
You could, too.

321
00:40:38,969 --> 00:40:41,197
If you'd stop drinking
all your profits.

322
00:40:41,714 --> 00:40:43,228
Hmm, yeah.
Fuck you!

323
00:40:44,073 --> 00:40:47,373
You know I'd be out of sorts
without my, ah, medicine.

324
00:40:47,655 --> 00:40:50,892
Your medicine. Right.

325
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:52,932
Ah, it won't take me
but a moment.

326
00:40:52,993 --> 00:40:53,931
Do you mind if we, ah...

327
00:40:53,956 --> 00:40:55,463
Stop off at the bath room?

328
00:40:55,861 --> 00:40:57,439
You have to pee again?

329
00:40:58,270 --> 00:41:00,220
How ever did you guess?

330
00:41:01,732 --> 00:41:02,697
Sure.

331
00:41:54,529 --> 00:41:56,554
I hate it
when that happens!

332
00:41:57,833 --> 00:41:59,195
Lloyd?

333
00:41:59,757 --> 00:42:01,757
You made me piss myself!

334
00:42:02,629 --> 00:42:05,257
I'm gonna
slap you so hard!

335
00:42:08,782 --> 00:42:09,960
Lloyd?

336
00:42:45,275 --> 00:42:47,448
OHHH! Please!

337
00:43:09,195 --> 00:43:11,676
Hey, Sammy!
What you doing in there?

338
00:43:12,039 --> 00:43:13,086
Sammy?

339
00:43:20,627 --> 00:43:22,958
Shit.
Now I gotta go.

340
00:43:38,140 --> 00:43:41,144
Tanked after
only a few drinks.

341
00:43:44,699 --> 00:43:47,184
Are you sure it
isn't something you ate?

342
00:43:47,357 --> 00:43:49,234
Or maybe someone?

343
00:43:53,468 --> 00:43:54,567
Okay.

344
00:43:55,079 --> 00:43:56,956
So it ain't funny.

345
00:44:02,701 --> 00:44:04,723
You aren't still mad
at me, are you?

346
00:44:04,794 --> 00:44:06,286
I mean about the money.

347
00:44:08,559 --> 00:44:10,277
Come on, Sammy.

348
00:44:10,396 --> 00:44:12,774
I won that fair
and square.

349
00:44:16,056 --> 00:44:17,661
That's the way
it's done.

350
00:44:51,685 --> 00:44:52,988
Sammy?

351
00:44:54,031 --> 00:44:55,129
Sammy?

352
00:44:57,482 --> 00:44:58,691
Sammy?

353
00:45:32,311 --> 00:45:35,910
You could have stayed here if
you needed a place to sleep.

354
00:45:36,350 --> 00:45:39,695
What did this...
This beast do?

355
00:45:50,220 --> 00:45:51,348
My god!

356
00:45:52,881 --> 00:45:54,383
Alex, you...

357
00:45:54,714 --> 00:45:57,150
You wouldn't hurt
yourself, would you?

358
00:45:57,823 --> 00:45:58,870
Fuck you!

359
00:46:00,767 --> 00:46:02,650
Alex! Wait!

360
00:46:03,911 --> 00:46:05,517
You came to me
for help,

361
00:46:05,813 --> 00:46:08,470
but I can only help you
if you're honest with me.

362
00:46:08,495 --> 00:46:11,056
I never lied to you. Never.

363
00:46:12,002 --> 00:46:13,877
The police have been met
with another grizzly surprise,

364
00:46:13,902 --> 00:46:16,478
in the predawn darkness. This
time on the upper West Side.

365
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:18,968
Connie Sanchez
has the latest. Connie?

366
00:46:19,056 --> 00:46:20,308
That's right, Brian.

367
00:46:20,551 --> 00:46:21,986
Detectives have no leads
yet in a double homicide

368
00:46:22,011 --> 00:46:23,388
that shattered
this quiet West Side

369
00:46:23,413 --> 00:46:24,539
neighborhood
late last night.

370
00:46:24,886 --> 00:46:27,691
New York residents Lloyd
Carter and Sammy chung

371
00:46:27,716 --> 00:46:30,014
were found brutally stabbed
directly behind me,

372
00:46:30,054 --> 00:46:34,025
in a public restroom, right here
at the 79th street boat basin.

373
00:46:34,104 --> 00:46:37,358
Their bodies found shortly before
sunrise by a maintenance man.

374
00:46:37,424 --> 00:46:39,228
You know, we, we,
we came, you know,

375
00:46:39,253 --> 00:46:41,189
and all of a sudden, there was
cops all over the place...

376
00:46:42,061 --> 00:46:43,337
I killed them.

377
00:46:45,150 --> 00:46:46,478
I killed them.

378
00:46:47,017 --> 00:46:49,509
Alex, you didn't kill anybody.

379
00:46:50,786 --> 00:46:52,259
Things from my dreams...

380
00:46:52,900 --> 00:46:54,994
They're not
in my dreams anymore.

381
00:46:55,456 --> 00:46:59,177
You know, we've had
our ups and downs with bums...

382
00:46:59,468 --> 00:47:00,806
Alex!

383
00:47:09,207 --> 00:47:11,291
Leave me alone.
It's Alex, man.

384
00:47:11,752 --> 00:47:13,049
It's not a good time.

385
00:47:13,118 --> 00:47:15,306
It's important, man.
I gotta see you.

386
00:47:24,590 --> 00:47:25,939
Are you okay?

387
00:47:26,970 --> 00:47:28,986
Two good friends
are dead.

388
00:47:30,495 --> 00:47:32,668
How do you think I am?

389
00:48:20,714 --> 00:48:21,817
Sit down.

390
00:48:23,404 --> 00:48:25,442
How much have
you had to drink?

391
00:48:28,190 --> 00:48:30,864
You came here to play
chess, didn't you?

392
00:48:31,925 --> 00:48:33,677
So let's play.

393
00:48:35,731 --> 00:48:38,701
Maybe... maybe when
you feel better.

394
00:48:39,124 --> 00:48:40,138
Better?

395
00:48:43,291 --> 00:48:44,575
I haven't felt better.

396
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:46,200
And I haven't
played better

397
00:48:46,225 --> 00:48:49,474
now that I stopped
taking this shit!

398
00:48:51,537 --> 00:48:54,146
Check!
And check-fucking-mate!

399
00:49:07,462 --> 00:49:08,805
Okay.

400
00:49:09,745 --> 00:49:11,341
Okay, we'll play! Just...

401
00:49:11,750 --> 00:49:16,614
It's not every day your friends
get butchered by some beast.

402
00:49:19,189 --> 00:49:20,692
What did you just say?

403
00:49:21,544 --> 00:49:22,636
Nothing.

404
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:24,989
Something I heard
on the news.

405
00:49:29,989 --> 00:49:31,567
I have something
to tell you.

406
00:49:32,390 --> 00:49:34,263
I have something
to tell you.

407
00:49:35,361 --> 00:49:37,114
White moves first.

408
00:49:38,021 --> 00:49:39,786
So, seeing that
you're white...

409
00:49:40,294 --> 00:49:43,411
I do believe that
pleasure is all yours.

410
00:49:58,646 --> 00:50:00,193
You know...

411
00:50:01,403 --> 00:50:04,353
Ev, ev, ev, ever since
Nimzowitsch developed the,

412
00:50:05,191 --> 00:50:09,037
the flexible dynamic approach
to the queen's pawn,

413
00:50:09,757 --> 00:50:12,739
the chess world
has been polarized

414
00:50:12,764 --> 00:50:15,062
as to what white's
response should be.

415
00:50:16,962 --> 00:50:20,982
I would put the rubinstein
variation into play.

416
00:50:25,367 --> 00:50:26,872
Good for you.

417
00:50:33,122 --> 00:50:35,349
A little late for
the catalan opening.

418
00:50:35,450 --> 00:50:37,567
You need to focus
on your middle game.

419
00:50:38,620 --> 00:50:40,982
Who's been whispering
into your ears?

420
00:50:41,813 --> 00:50:43,263
You don't want to know.

421
00:50:50,389 --> 00:50:53,232
See? Never underestimate the
Cambridge Springs defense.

422
00:50:53,951 --> 00:50:55,505
That's what Karpov did.

423
00:50:55,758 --> 00:50:58,497
That's how Kasparov
kicked his ass in '85.

424
00:51:07,054 --> 00:51:08,263
Check.

425
00:51:11,093 --> 00:51:12,942
Well, we'll
see about that.

426
00:51:17,774 --> 00:51:18,786
Check.

427
00:51:31,292 --> 00:51:32,528
Mate.

428
00:51:35,831 --> 00:51:37,411
The Borden sacrifice.

429
00:51:52,847 --> 00:51:55,600
I haven't lost a chess game
in almost three years.

430
00:51:55,658 --> 00:51:58,646
So, here's to the
Rubinstein variation.

431
00:52:00,164 --> 00:52:01,880
And the Borden sacrifice.

432
00:52:04,521 --> 00:52:07,320
You gonna,
you gonna be okay?

433
00:52:12,620 --> 00:52:15,083
I told you.
Never better.

434
00:52:16,452 --> 00:52:18,796
Here, drink up!

435
00:52:20,519 --> 00:52:22,388
Uh... thanks.
I'll, I'll pass.

436
00:52:24,262 --> 00:52:25,684
Do you want to play
like a man?

437
00:52:25,769 --> 00:52:27,362
You drink like a man.

438
00:52:31,397 --> 00:52:34,367
Tell me about
your paintings.

439
00:52:35,661 --> 00:52:37,458
You wanna play another
- Tell me about your fucking paintings!

440
00:52:37,483 --> 00:52:40,028
Do you really want
to know what I know?!

441
00:52:42,066 --> 00:52:44,778
I scare you, don't I?!

442
00:52:47,553 --> 00:52:48,653
We play!

443
00:52:48,678 --> 00:52:49,802
Again!

444
00:52:53,928 --> 00:52:55,739
I can't emphasize
this enough.

445
00:52:55,764 --> 00:52:58,267
It's a very
serious matter.

446
00:52:59,438 --> 00:53:03,786
Giving up your rights as legal
guardian of the children is permanent.

447
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:05,177
Irrevocable.

448
00:53:06,862 --> 00:53:10,036
Once I place them
in a foster home,

449
00:53:10,198 --> 00:53:12,810
the new parents can
adopt the children.

450
00:53:13,436 --> 00:53:17,536
They can change their names,
and even move out of state.

451
00:53:17,873 --> 00:53:21,423
And once that happens, it's next
to impossible to get them back.

452
00:53:22,069 --> 00:53:23,825
I urge you
to think it over.

453
00:53:23,850 --> 00:53:25,648
I don't need
more time to think.

454
00:53:26,108 --> 00:53:27,860
I want you
to take th em now.

455
00:53:28,097 --> 00:53:29,644
The sooner, the better.

456
00:53:32,153 --> 00:53:33,905
I have the papers here.

457
00:53:34,641 --> 00:53:36,393
If you'll
take them and...

458
00:53:36,420 --> 00:53:38,669
Read th em over.

459
00:53:51,294 --> 00:53:52,591
It's done.

460
00:53:58,781 --> 00:54:03,255
Oh... and there's
another thing.

461
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:07,552
I want you to listen
to me very carefully.

462
00:54:35,163 --> 00:54:36,756
What the fuck!

463
00:54:36,923 --> 00:54:37,958
Whoa, whoa.

464
00:54:37,983 --> 00:54:39,224
What's the matter
with you, man?

465
00:54:39,288 --> 00:54:40,278
Don't do that.

466
00:54:40,916 --> 00:54:42,497
Okay, sorry.

467
00:54:42,674 --> 00:54:45,060
The other night, there
were reports of a peeper.

468
00:54:45,490 --> 00:54:46,537
A what?

469
00:54:46,588 --> 00:54:48,317
A fucking peeper.

470
00:54:48,386 --> 00:54:50,028
I thought you might
be the perv.

471
00:54:50,377 --> 00:54:51,403
Can I come in?

472
00:54:53,064 --> 00:54:53,966
Okay. Sure.

473
00:54:57,907 --> 00:55:00,521
Things from hell
are after me.

474
00:55:00,974 --> 00:55:03,192
I know that sounds,
that sounds, whatever.

475
00:55:03,701 --> 00:55:05,239
But, I... I can't
call the doctors

476
00:55:05,264 --> 00:55:06,641
because they'll put me
in a straightjacket.

477
00:55:06,719 --> 00:55:07,849
I can't...

478
00:55:08,143 --> 00:55:12,192
I can't sleep because there's like
a fucking monster in my closet.

479
00:55:13,126 --> 00:55:15,677
And I have
this headache.

480
00:55:16,395 --> 00:55:19,349
Because I know things, I know,
i know a million things,

481
00:55:19,374 --> 00:55:21,630
that I, I have no idea
how I know them.

482
00:55:21,828 --> 00:55:23,739
I'm mastering
the game of chess...

483
00:55:24,317 --> 00:55:26,028
I'm reading cervantes.

484
00:55:26,741 --> 00:55:28,403
I know these things.

485
00:55:36,651 --> 00:55:38,755
I know you guys
fucked an hour ago.

486
00:55:58,797 --> 00:56:00,674
Your brother doesn't
know that you talked

487
00:56:00,699 --> 00:56:02,542
your father into
changing his will.

488
00:56:07,087 --> 00:56:08,872
What the fuck are
you talking about?

489
00:56:12,602 --> 00:56:13,854
And you.

490
00:56:13,879 --> 00:56:14,971
You say that...

491
00:56:15,060 --> 00:56:16,528
You say that you're
true to Jason.

492
00:56:16,852 --> 00:56:18,399
But when you wanted
a raise at work,

493
00:56:18,424 --> 00:56:20,142
you flashed your
supervisor your tits.

494
00:56:25,266 --> 00:56:27,357
Jason, that's not true.
Yes, it is.

495
00:56:28,298 --> 00:56:29,747
You even let
him feel you up.

496
00:56:30,044 --> 00:56:33,014
Okay. You need to leave.

497
00:56:33,352 --> 00:56:34,263
Now.

498
00:56:36,438 --> 00:56:37,610
Okay.

499
00:56:38,273 --> 00:56:39,365
Yeah.

500
00:56:39,939 --> 00:56:41,816
I didn't think you
could help me.

501
00:57:52,498 --> 00:57:54,607
Is there anything I can
do for you, son?

502
00:57:55,663 --> 00:57:58,667
I'm... I'm Alex.

503
00:57:59,755 --> 00:58:01,567
Reverend Hartman.

504
00:58:04,714 --> 00:58:06,216
You look lost.

505
00:58:07,521 --> 00:58:10,070
You know, you're not
the first young man

506
00:58:10,095 --> 00:58:12,814
with a dazed expression...

507
00:58:12,871 --> 00:58:14,982
Who wanders in here
in dead of night.

508
00:58:15,150 --> 00:58:18,755
There are things
that are after me.

509
00:58:19,406 --> 00:58:20,583
Hurting
people around me.

510
00:58:20,608 --> 00:58:21,778
Who is after you?

511
00:58:22,729 --> 00:58:24,652
Things you find
in shadows.

512
00:58:26,374 --> 00:58:27,763
They're not pretty.

513
00:58:28,183 --> 00:58:29,776
They're never pretty.

514
00:58:30,740 --> 00:58:32,021
When do you see them?

515
00:58:32,421 --> 00:58:33,622
Night, mostly.

516
00:58:34,536 --> 00:58:35,880
Welcome to the club.

517
00:58:35,905 --> 00:58:36,966
What else, Alex?

518
00:58:37,516 --> 00:58:39,958
I, ah, I see things and
i see these

519
00:58:39,990 --> 00:58:42,481
memories of my past that
never happened to me.

520
00:58:42,976 --> 00:58:44,786
Or at least
i don't think so.

521
00:58:44,911 --> 00:58:47,833
It sounds like you're
really in big trouble, Alex.

522
00:58:48,591 --> 00:58:49,630
So what do we do?

523
00:58:49,655 --> 00:58:51,498
You're sure you want to be helped?
Yes.

524
00:58:52,222 --> 00:58:53,614
That's all I want.

525
00:58:53,639 --> 00:58:54,372
Yes.

526
00:58:55,520 --> 00:58:56,833
I'll be right back.

527
00:59:08,708 --> 00:59:11,248
Our substance
independence group

528
00:59:11,327 --> 00:59:13,998
meets every Tuesday
and Thursday evening.

529
00:59:14,023 --> 00:59:16,242
It's very discreet.
No one has to know.

530
00:59:16,267 --> 00:59:17,419
Lam...

531
00:59:18,119 --> 00:59:19,336
I am not an addict!

532
00:59:20,191 --> 00:59:21,568
What I'm telling you
is real!

533
00:59:22,046 --> 00:59:23,389
People are dying!

534
00:59:24,136 --> 00:59:25,482
Really?
You believe that?

535
00:59:25,507 --> 00:59:29,745
Yes. That's what I keep
trying to tell you.

536
00:59:30,521 --> 00:59:32,404
Why doesn't anyone
believe me?

537
00:59:34,146 --> 00:59:35,313
I believe you, Alex.

538
00:59:35,338 --> 00:59:37,156
But, important is,

539
00:59:37,779 --> 00:59:38,992
what you believe.

540
00:59:39,841 --> 00:59:42,095
I don't know what to believe anymore.
I don't know who to believe.

541
00:59:42,374 --> 00:59:43,421
That is why I'm here.

542
00:59:45,995 --> 00:59:48,544
So you say you're
plagued by evil.

543
00:59:49,323 --> 00:59:50,206
Yes.

544
00:59:50,429 --> 00:59:51,674
More and more.

545
00:59:52,907 --> 00:59:55,807
Evil, Alex, is merely
the absence of good.

546
00:59:56,352 --> 00:59:59,572
As for me, it's the proof
of good, the test of good.

547
01:00:00,144 --> 01:00:04,924
There are two opposing forces,

548
01:00:05,822 --> 01:00:09,276
locked in mortal combat
fighting for eternity.

549
01:00:10,144 --> 01:00:11,589
What are they
fighting for?

550
01:00:12,162 --> 01:00:13,924
What are they
fighting for?

551
01:00:14,359 --> 01:00:16,151
They're fighting
for you, Alex.

552
01:00:16,482 --> 01:00:19,827
For your intellect, humanity,
what you might call your soul.

553
01:00:20,563 --> 01:00:22,690
You know, you have
to be very careful.

554
01:00:23,723 --> 01:00:26,581
The devil can be
a very tricky one.

555
01:00:26,897 --> 01:00:29,128
So, what do
i do? I pray?

556
01:00:31,614 --> 01:00:32,503
Here.

557
01:00:33,863 --> 01:00:36,412
Alex. A good start.

558
01:00:38,247 --> 01:00:39,721
Oh, my god.

559
01:00:41,681 --> 01:00:42,784
You're bleeding.

560
01:00:42,943 --> 01:00:44,570
You're bleeding.

561
01:00:48,897 --> 01:00:50,596
We have to leave
here right now.

562
01:00:50,862 --> 01:00:53,120
Leave? Why?
Listen to me!

563
01:00:53,837 --> 01:00:55,805
You have to leave here right
now or you're going to die.

564
01:00:56,277 --> 01:00:58,120
Why leave?

565
01:00:58,787 --> 01:00:59,870
Alex!

566
01:01:00,330 --> 01:01:03,331
We are already here, Alex!

567
01:01:07,939 --> 01:01:10,692
Alex, my son.

568
01:01:10,812 --> 01:01:11,938
What's happened to you?

569
01:01:12,628 --> 01:01:13,654
You okay?

570
01:01:44,142 --> 01:01:47,317
Alex, you had nothing
to do with those murders.

571
01:01:48,122 --> 01:01:50,552
You can't blame yourself
for what happens around you.

572
01:01:50,596 --> 01:01:53,213
You can only be
responsible for yourself.

573
01:01:53,238 --> 01:01:54,896
Bull fucking shit!

574
01:02:01,873 --> 01:02:06,219
My brain is growing.

575
01:02:09,766 --> 01:02:12,216
I wish I didn't
have to do this,

576
01:02:12,853 --> 01:02:15,606
because I don't think
it's in your best interest.

577
01:02:15,858 --> 01:02:18,611
But maybe you need to hear
it from someone else.

578
01:02:18,896 --> 01:02:20,648
Then you'll believe me.

579
01:02:23,154 --> 01:02:24,246
What is this?

580
01:02:26,643 --> 01:02:29,224
I know someone
who wrote an article

581
01:02:29,249 --> 01:02:31,843
for the "annals
of abnormal psychology."

582
01:02:32,551 --> 01:02:35,600
He used to be a rather
respected metaphysician.

583
01:02:35,663 --> 01:02:40,419
Over time, his theories began
to get Wilder and Wilder.

584
01:02:41,327 --> 01:02:45,083
Towards the end, we thought
they were pure fantasy.

585
01:02:46,183 --> 01:02:50,755
He was finally blacklisted by
most conventional practitioners.

586
01:02:51,647 --> 01:02:54,241
How is this going
to help me?

587
01:02:55,642 --> 01:03:00,747
By proving to you once and
for all what you aren't.

588
01:03:12,191 --> 01:03:13,283
Yes?

589
01:03:13,512 --> 01:03:16,419
Um, Dr. Karen
Murphy sent me.

590
01:03:29,672 --> 01:03:30,865
You know.

591
01:03:31,913 --> 01:03:33,537
You are seeing them?

592
01:03:35,374 --> 01:03:36,771
You believe me?

593
01:03:37,062 --> 01:03:38,063
Believe?

594
01:03:38,269 --> 01:03:40,655
Is not empirical term, please,

595
01:03:41,392 --> 01:03:43,895
do come in, quickly!

596
01:03:51,756 --> 01:03:53,968
They have finally
come true.

597
01:03:55,161 --> 01:03:56,210
Yes?

598
01:03:56,788 --> 01:03:58,155
I...
I don't, I don't-

599
01:03:58,180 --> 01:04:01,184
killings are happening
all around you,

600
01:04:01,339 --> 01:04:05,936
violent killings of much
blood, much suffering. Yes?

601
01:04:09,662 --> 01:04:11,046
I am Pavlovsky.

602
01:04:11,071 --> 01:04:12,789
Boris Pavlovsky.

603
01:04:13,757 --> 01:04:18,308
I first find out about them
at institute in Moscow.

604
01:04:18,580 --> 01:04:23,381
A subject was also a "link."

605
01:04:23,406 --> 01:04:27,163
Like you.
That is what we call them.

606
01:04:28,404 --> 01:04:31,398
A link from world we know

607
01:04:31,647 --> 01:04:35,151
to world we cannot imagine.

608
01:04:35,592 --> 01:04:36,684
What are they?

609
01:04:38,300 --> 01:04:39,921
Who can say?

610
01:04:40,532 --> 01:04:45,254
They are not from this
plane of existence.

611
01:04:45,654 --> 01:04:50,437
But only people like you,
"links" you can see them.

612
01:04:51,735 --> 01:04:53,362
What do they want?

613
01:04:53,630 --> 01:04:55,507
I'm not sure.

614
01:04:55,776 --> 01:04:59,671
No one has ever
survived an encounter.

615
01:05:00,809 --> 01:05:03,640
Link I studied is dead.

616
01:05:05,108 --> 01:05:06,218
If they're so powerful,

617
01:05:06,243 --> 01:05:08,072
then why haven't they
killed me already?

618
01:05:08,723 --> 01:05:12,452
They are scared
of your power.

619
01:05:13,905 --> 01:05:14,991
I, I don't
have any power.

620
01:05:15,016 --> 01:05:17,616
Ah, but you do.

621
01:05:17,959 --> 01:05:20,194
But they never stop.

622
01:05:20,343 --> 01:05:22,280
Never sleep.

623
01:05:22,474 --> 01:05:25,390
Where you go, they smell
you on other people.

624
01:05:25,415 --> 01:05:29,124
Everything you touch,
everyone you touch-

625
01:05:29,210 --> 01:05:31,588
that is how they
are following you.

626
01:05:31,997 --> 01:05:33,044
Yeah, but...

627
01:05:46,751 --> 01:05:47,733
It's me.

628
01:05:48,805 --> 01:05:49,694
It's my fault.

629
01:05:50,153 --> 01:05:51,826
Is not fault.

630
01:05:52,442 --> 01:05:55,304
Is destiny. Yours.

631
01:05:56,156 --> 01:05:57,453
The gloves.

632
01:05:57,866 --> 01:06:00,268
The gloves. That's why you
wouldn't shake my hands.

633
01:06:01,477 --> 01:06:07,772
Even now, I am in danger
with you in my house.

634
01:06:08,312 --> 01:06:09,859
There are others
like me?

635
01:06:10,578 --> 01:06:14,194
Once were plenty.
Now, no more.

636
01:06:14,755 --> 01:06:16,723
At institute...

637
01:06:16,868 --> 01:06:21,248
Soviet institute
of metaphysical science,

638
01:06:21,375 --> 01:06:23,503
we study many links.

639
01:06:23,778 --> 01:06:26,171
Isolate th em.
Tap into brains.

640
01:06:26,196 --> 01:06:31,168
Learn that they use part
of brain other humans cannot.

641
01:06:31,317 --> 01:06:34,366
Know things
other humans do not.

642
01:06:34,834 --> 01:06:37,733
One link is like genius.

643
01:06:37,873 --> 01:06:42,030
Two links, three links
together, like weapon.

644
01:06:42,122 --> 01:06:43,715
Psychic laser.

645
01:06:47,028 --> 01:06:52,303
Make the ministry
of defense very happy.

646
01:07:01,555 --> 01:07:04,038
I... I'm going
to throw up.

647
01:07:04,188 --> 01:07:05,940
Other link...

648
01:07:06,835 --> 01:07:10,632
One who is giving
you power...

649
01:07:11,761 --> 01:07:13,030
Is who?

650
01:07:14,633 --> 01:07:16,874
I, I don't, I don't know,
i, I don't know who that...

651
01:07:16,899 --> 01:07:20,529
Visions are new to you?

652
01:07:24,356 --> 01:07:29,783
Link is someone you
are recently meeting.

653
01:07:29,980 --> 01:07:33,975
That is when visions
are growing strongest.

654
01:07:35,493 --> 01:07:36,264
Yes.

655
01:07:37,786 --> 01:07:41,459
Yes. Oh, yes.

656
01:07:44,958 --> 01:07:46,389
I know who it is.

657
01:07:48,479 --> 01:07:50,248
What can we do
to stop this?

658
01:07:51,479 --> 01:07:53,037
Tell me what
that means!

659
01:07:53,234 --> 01:07:55,532
You'll know soon enough.

660
01:08:06,691 --> 01:08:08,326
Look what you did.

661
01:08:09,542 --> 01:08:11,761
You brought evil
into this house!

662
01:08:12,155 --> 01:08:13,717
Evil has many faces.

663
01:08:14,991 --> 01:08:16,615
Evil!

664
01:08:27,194 --> 01:08:29,117
Come on, hey...
We're gonna play a game,

665
01:08:29,250 --> 01:08:32,049
we're gonna,
we're gonna play a game.

666
01:08:32,640 --> 01:08:34,371
We're gonna play a game.

667
01:08:34,492 --> 01:08:36,995
Come get me.
We're gonna play a game.

668
01:08:37,763 --> 01:08:40,357
We're gonna,
we're gonna play.

669
01:08:40,641 --> 01:08:42,689
Play... play...

670
01:08:51,625 --> 01:08:53,548
Look,
it's not you. Stop.

671
01:08:53,636 --> 01:08:55,410
Stay back!
You leave us alone.

672
01:08:55,435 --> 01:08:57,358
Don't do this! Now!

673
01:08:58,101 --> 01:08:59,386
We have to stick
together, okay?

674
01:08:59,411 --> 01:09:02,130
As long as I'm here, I won't let
anything happen to you, Alex.

675
01:09:02,749 --> 01:09:07,004
Giving up your rights of
the children is permanent.

676
01:09:10,098 --> 01:09:13,379
My dream, they
tried to get me in my dream.

677
01:09:13,404 --> 01:09:15,452
You've seen them, too?

678
01:09:15,818 --> 01:09:16,902
I've got you.

679
01:09:16,927 --> 01:09:18,770
I got...
I got you!

680
01:09:23,173 --> 01:09:24,971
Harry Jellenik.

681
01:09:25,853 --> 01:09:26,972
Alex Borden.

682
01:09:41,936 --> 01:09:45,657
Wanna play a game?
Let's play a game.

683
01:10:23,051 --> 01:10:25,349
I got you! I got you!

684
01:10:42,839 --> 01:10:44,432
Harry?

685
01:11:32,348 --> 01:11:35,550
I want you to listen
to me very carefully.

686
01:11:35,764 --> 01:11:39,064
Whatever you do, you
keep these boys apart.

687
01:11:39,491 --> 01:11:42,711
Separate. Do not place
them in the same home.

688
01:11:43,449 --> 01:11:45,027
But it's customary-

689
01:11:45,052 --> 01:11:46,105
I don't care.

690
01:11:46,130 --> 01:11:48,316
I know what's best for them
and the people around them.

691
01:11:48,902 --> 01:11:50,425
Do you understand?

692
01:13:11,469 --> 01:13:15,770
<i>I</i> got you! <i>I</i> got you!

693
01:14:37,650 --> 01:14:41,154
What the hell is going on?
You know what time it is?

694
01:14:43,712 --> 01:14:45,510
Jesus Christ!

695
01:14:48,318 --> 01:14:49,206
You have to get out of here.

696
01:14:49,231 --> 01:14:49,870
Slow down.

697
01:14:49,895 --> 01:14:50,609
Listen to me.

698
01:14:50,634 --> 01:14:51,463
You have to
get out of here.

699
01:14:51,488 --> 01:14:52,666
Alex, you're scaring me.

700
01:14:52,683 --> 01:14:53,479


701
01:14:53,504 --> 01:14:55,472
What is it, man?

702
01:14:58,359 --> 01:14:59,862
It's them.

703
01:15:00,635 --> 01:15:03,745
It's them.
Who the fuck is them?

704
01:15:06,837 --> 01:15:07,963
Alex?

705
01:15:09,273 --> 01:15:11,112
What are you doing, man?

706
01:15:15,536 --> 01:15:16,253
<i>Hey.</i>

707
01:15:16,537 --> 01:15:17,379
<i>Hey.</i>

708
01:15:18,604 --> 01:15:20,823
Alex? Is that you?

709
01:15:21,701 --> 01:15:22,748
What's going on?

710
01:15:22,925 --> 01:15:27,060
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Calm the fuck down!

711
01:15:27,224 --> 01:15:30,103
Alex. Put that thing down.
You're going to hurt somebody.

712
01:15:30,801 --> 01:15:31,646
Alex.

713
01:15:32,554 --> 01:15:33,724
Listen to me.

714
01:15:34,670 --> 01:15:36,718
Drop the knife.

715
01:15:36,763 --> 01:15:38,561
Number 2405
west 71st street.

716
01:15:38,586 --> 01:15:40,703
We need some help here.
You've gotta come right now.

717
01:15:40,730 --> 01:15:42,796
We need some help. You need
to get here right now.

718
01:15:42,821 --> 01:15:44,994
What the fuck!?
What are you doing?

719
01:15:45,242 --> 01:15:46,304
Whoa!

720
01:15:47,065 --> 01:15:48,078
I can't.
They won't...

721
01:15:48,103 --> 01:15:49,342
They won't understand
what's happened...

722
01:15:49,367 --> 01:15:50,890
I don't understand
what's happening.

723
01:15:50,915 --> 01:15:52,706
Why don't you tell us?

724
01:15:52,731 --> 01:15:53,851
I can't stop it.

725
01:15:53,876 --> 01:15:55,344
I can't stop it!

726
01:16:05,377 --> 01:16:06,468
Stop us.

727
01:16:07,338 --> 01:16:08,648
Kill us.

728
01:16:28,953 --> 01:16:30,625
You okay, Alex?

729
01:16:33,901 --> 01:16:35,403
Do you want to die?

730
01:16:35,819 --> 01:16:37,492
Like your mother?

731
01:16:39,203 --> 01:16:40,375
Like your brother?

732
01:16:44,692 --> 01:16:45,693
Fucking back up!

733
01:16:45,718 --> 01:16:46,594
Whoa! Hey!

734
01:16:46,619 --> 01:16:47,962
Alex, put the knife down.

735
01:16:48,124 --> 01:16:49,265
Put the fucking knife down.
Come on, knock it off.

736
01:16:49,362 --> 01:16:50,284
Come on, man.

737
01:16:50,539 --> 01:16:52,359
Stay there.
Back up.

738
01:16:52,925 --> 01:16:54,017
Put the knife down!

739
01:16:54,042 --> 01:16:54,750
Back up!

740
01:16:54,775 --> 01:16:55,711
Come on!

741
01:16:59,218 --> 01:17:00,185
Come on, we're your friends!

742
01:17:00,336 --> 01:17:01,258
Back up!

743
01:17:02,690 --> 01:17:06,304
Alex, calm down. Alex,
you need to get some help.

744
01:17:06,329 --> 01:17:07,148
Back up!

745
01:17:07,173 --> 01:17:08,617
Come on,
this is ridiculous.

746
01:17:08,642 --> 01:17:09,882
Put the knife down!

747
01:17:09,907 --> 01:17:11,329
I'm not going to do
anything to you!

748
01:17:11,665 --> 01:17:14,265
I'm not asking you again! Who are you?!
Who are you?!

749
01:17:15,450 --> 01:17:16,622
Back up!

750
01:17:20,111 --> 01:17:21,929
Calm down, kid, you
don't want to do this.

751
01:17:21,954 --> 01:17:23,422
It's not them!

752
01:17:23,784 --> 01:17:25,492
See?! It's not them!

753
01:17:25,517 --> 01:17:26,188
Drop it.

754
01:17:29,659 --> 01:17:31,127
Drop the knife.
Drop it!

755
01:17:41,127 --> 01:17:42,504
Oh, my god.

756
01:17:47,453 --> 01:17:48,830
It's not them.
Listen to me!

757
01:17:48,965 --> 01:17:50,933
Listen to me!
Listen to me!

758
01:17:50,958 --> 01:17:52,881
It's not them,
it's not them!

759
01:17:53,030 --> 01:17:54,664
It's not them!

760
01:18:14,256 --> 01:18:15,929
Motherfucker!

761
01:18:18,036 --> 01:18:19,663
Motherfucker!

762
01:18:23,815 --> 01:18:26,263
Stop! Stop! Aah!

763
01:18:28,437 --> 01:18:30,209
If we only knew something.

764
01:18:30,546 --> 01:18:33,584
Anything about what's
going on in his head.

765
01:18:34,406 --> 01:18:36,631
We were starting
to make progress.

766
01:18:36,701 --> 01:18:37,589
Karen...

767
01:18:39,496 --> 01:18:41,396
we don't know what to do.

768
01:18:41,640 --> 01:18:45,315
We're not even
sure what he is.

769
01:18:47,846 --> 01:18:51,191
Do you mind if I spend
a little longer with him?

770
01:18:51,506 --> 01:18:53,029
Be my guest.

771
01:18:54,033 --> 01:18:57,084
You may be the only
friend he has left.

772
01:18:58,274 --> 01:19:00,743
There's a coma
blue in the south ward.

773
01:19:01,136 --> 01:19:02,228
...please notify...

774
01:19:53,934 --> 01:19:55,301
It's okay, baby.

775
01:19:55,996 --> 01:19:58,749
Everything's gonna be okay.

776
01:19:59,219 --> 01:20:01,262
No more pain...

777
01:20:01,923 --> 01:20:03,699
No more troubles.

778
01:20:22,843 --> 01:20:25,129
You have to be
careful, Alex.

779
01:20:25,494 --> 01:20:29,285
Evil can be a very tricky one.
