Can I get you another?

26
00:03:23,554 --> 00:03:25,289
Yeah, I'll get another one,
thanks.

27
00:03:25,422 --> 00:03:26,457
Coming right up.

28
00:03:27,358 --> 00:03:28,925

[Sunny]
Ugh, they're almost done.

31
00:03:32,929 --> 00:03:34,264
Good, what's taking
them so long?

32
00:03:34,398 --> 00:03:36,367
Something about insurance
or whatever.

33
00:03:37,468 --> 00:03:39,269
Yeah, we should've
handled that weeks ago.

34
00:03:39,403 --> 00:03:40,504
Yeah.

35
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:42,740
Well, all I know is
the captain's a real hoot.

36
00:03:42,872 --> 00:03:43,940
[Sunny laughing]

37
00:03:44,073 --> 00:03:45,609
Is that a good thing
or a bad thing?

38
00:03:45,743 --> 00:03:47,378
I don't know.
Hope it's a good thing.

39
00:03:47,511 --> 00:03:48,511
[both laughing]

40
00:03:48,579 --> 00:03:49,579
[gentle music]

41
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:52,014
Aw, you doing okay?

42
00:03:52,816 --> 00:03:54,718
Yeah, I'm okay.

43
00:03:54,852 --> 00:03:56,787
You know,
you have us here, right?

44
00:03:56,919 --> 00:03:58,255
I promise.

45
00:03:58,389 --> 00:04:00,056
Girl, we have
a whole week of fun

46
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:03,794
with Captain Wally or whatever
the hell his name is.

47
00:04:03,926 --> 00:04:08,298
We have sun, snorkeling, booze.
Dude, we have our own boat.

48
00:04:08,432 --> 00:04:10,567
What more could a girl ask for?

49
00:04:11,402 --> 00:04:12,402
I know.

50
00:04:12,436 --> 00:04:14,103
I'm so grateful for you guys.

51
00:04:14,937 --> 00:04:16,349
If I had to stay at home
one more day,

52
00:04:16,373 --> 00:04:17,708
I think I would've
killed myself.

53
00:04:17,841 --> 00:04:20,577
Oh, girl, fuck that. [chuckles]

54
00:04:20,711 --> 00:04:22,979
No, that is over and done with.

55
00:04:23,112 --> 00:04:27,551
And I suggest you take
this thing, put it away.

56
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:30,454
And when we get home,
you sell that son of a bitch.

57
00:04:30,587 --> 00:04:31,587
[chuckles]

58
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:33,590
I can't do that,
I gotta give it back.

59
00:04:34,324 --> 00:04:37,126
Sis, fuck him,
he broke your heart.

60
00:04:37,261 --> 00:04:40,464
So you break the bank, okay?

61
00:04:41,331 --> 00:04:42,965
Put it away girl.
You want me to sell it?

62
00:04:43,099 --> 00:04:45,202
I'll sell it.
Don't leave it to me.

63
00:04:45,335 --> 00:04:49,673
Ladies, we sail
into the sunset within hours.

64
00:04:49,807 --> 00:04:53,109
- Everything went smoothly?
- [Ty] Smooth enough.

65
00:04:53,243 --> 00:04:55,446
It was pretty amazing,
if I do say so myself.

66
00:04:55,579 --> 00:04:57,514
- Will made an addition.
- [Sunny] Oh.

67
00:04:57,648 --> 00:04:58,916
Addition?

68
00:04:59,048 --> 00:05:01,151
- Just a little one.
- [Brie chuckles]

69
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:04,086
He got us
the new Booze Cruise option.

70
00:05:04,954 --> 00:05:05,988
- Oh.
- Yeah.

71
00:05:06,122 --> 00:05:07,162
- What's that?
- I don't...

72
00:05:07,191 --> 00:05:08,358
No seriously, what's that?

73
00:05:08,492 --> 00:05:10,092
Some add on
where the captain supplies us

74
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,662
an entire bar
while we're on the boat.

75
00:05:11,795 --> 00:05:14,531
Yeah, apparently
Will still thinks we're all 21.

76
00:05:14,665 --> 00:05:15,766
Yeah, yeah,

77
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:18,000
I'm still clinging
to my youth over here, okay.

78
00:05:18,134 --> 00:05:19,403
Hey look, we're on vacation.

79
00:05:19,536 --> 00:05:21,505
We're here to have a good time.

80
00:05:21,638 --> 00:05:23,941
- I don't know, but...
- With our good friend, Jessie.

81
00:05:24,073 --> 00:05:25,342
We needed some bottles to pop.

82
00:05:25,476 --> 00:05:26,886
Now we have some bottles to pop,
so there you go.

83
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:29,546
Hey, no complaints from me,
Will. You spend away.

84
00:05:30,247 --> 00:05:32,483
[gentle upbeat music]

85
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:35,953
It's gonna be amazing,
I swear to God.

86
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:38,188
Leave it up to him.
[chuckles]

87
00:05:40,122 --> 00:05:41,725
[birds chirping]

88
00:05:42,226 --> 00:05:43,993
[gentle music]

89
00:05:48,365 --> 00:05:51,635
I remember when I couldn't
get you outta bed before noon.

90
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:54,304
Now you're beating me
out the door every morning.

91
00:05:54,438 --> 00:05:56,005
- [gentle music]
- Morning, Dad.

92
00:05:58,140 --> 00:05:59,243
Going out for a surf?

93
00:05:59,376 --> 00:06:00,744
Yeah,
I'm gonna catch some waves,

94
00:06:00,878 --> 00:06:02,279
see if I could spot some whales.

95
00:06:02,412 --> 00:06:03,914
They're having
their calves right now.

96
00:06:04,046 --> 00:06:06,683
- Oh.
- [Jennifer chuckles]

97
00:06:06,817 --> 00:06:07,817
Be safe, Kiddo.

98
00:06:07,918 --> 00:06:09,219
[Jennifer] Love you.

99
00:06:10,254 --> 00:06:13,022
[gentle music]

100
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:27,069

[Jennifer screaming]

[dramatic music]

112
00:08:09,306 --> 00:08:11,174
[gasping]

113
00:08:11,308 --> 00:08:14,277
[dramatic music]

00:08:42,806 --> 00:08:44,841
[waves crashing]

115
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:48,945

[birds chirping]

118
00:08:57,155 --> 00:08:59,423
[waves crashing]

119
00:08:59,556 --> 00:09:01,291
[Beth] <i>So it's a five-day trip.</i>

120
00:09:01,425 --> 00:09:03,069
Wally knows the route,
everything's in line.

121
00:09:03,093 --> 00:09:04,303
I wanna make sure that you guys

122
00:09:04,327 --> 00:09:05,772
have the paperwork
before we set sail.

123
00:09:05,796 --> 00:09:06,796
Thank you.

124
00:09:06,863 --> 00:09:08,365
Damn tourists.

125
00:09:08,498 --> 00:09:09,766
You can't say damn tourists

126
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:12,102
because, well, you only
been here three months.

127
00:09:12,269 --> 00:09:16,106
Look, this island
has a economic generator

128
00:09:16,239 --> 00:09:17,239
and it is tourism.

129
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:18,375
Mm-hmm.

130
00:09:18,508 --> 00:09:19,752
[officer]
When I used to work at...

131
00:09:19,776 --> 00:09:21,511
[Harlan]
It's been a week, Sheriff,

132
00:09:21,645 --> 00:09:23,747
since I buried
what little they gave me

133
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:27,185
to bury of my daughter,
and not a single phone call

134
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:29,553
telling me
what you're doing about it.

135
00:09:30,353 --> 00:09:32,322
- Beth.
- Harlan.

136
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:34,725
Look, the part of me

137
00:09:34,858 --> 00:09:36,703
that might radiate a gentleman's
missing today, I'm afraid.

138
00:09:36,727 --> 00:09:42,232
So I apologize
for any choice words I may use.

139
00:09:42,365 --> 00:09:44,568
That's completely
understandable.

140
00:09:45,402 --> 00:09:47,704
I'm so, so, so sorry.

141
00:09:48,271 --> 00:09:49,506
Thank you.

142
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:51,274
Well?

143
00:09:51,408 --> 00:09:53,410
This conversation
doesn't come easy, Harlan.

144
00:09:53,543 --> 00:09:55,045
Well, it shouldn't be easy.

145
00:09:55,179 --> 00:09:58,381
I know this is
a very difficult time.

146
00:09:58,515 --> 00:10:00,484
You understand that, do you?

147
00:10:00,617 --> 00:10:01,657
You don't understand shit.

148
00:10:01,718 --> 00:10:03,420
And don't patronize me.

149
00:10:03,553 --> 00:10:05,021
A shark killed my baby

150
00:10:05,156 --> 00:10:07,691
and I want to know what the hell
you're doing about it.

151
00:10:07,824 --> 00:10:09,726
Look, we live
in a tourist destination.

152
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:11,962
Do I look like a man
that came in here

153
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:13,563
to talk to the hired help today,

154
00:10:13,697 --> 00:10:15,966
let alone one that doesn't know
his ass from his elbows

155
00:10:16,099 --> 00:10:17,634
around these islands?

156
00:10:17,768 --> 00:10:20,504
Are you writing my daughter off
as just another statistic, Kula?

157
00:10:20,637 --> 00:10:22,305
Is that what
you're fucking doing?

158
00:10:22,439 --> 00:10:26,443
No, I'm grieving with you.

159
00:10:27,444 --> 00:10:29,880
[sighs] We are so sorry.

160
00:10:30,013 --> 00:10:31,715
You know,
it's a tragic situation.

161
00:10:31,848 --> 00:10:32,848
Tragic.

162
00:10:32,949 --> 00:10:34,885
God, if I hear tragic
one more time.

163
00:10:35,018 --> 00:10:38,588
Tragic is when your daughter
dies in a car accident,

164
00:10:38,722 --> 00:10:41,658
or tragic is when your daughter
dies from an overdose,

165
00:10:42,193 --> 00:10:43,527
from some bullshit.

166
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:47,931
My daughter was eaten alive
by a fucking fish.

167
00:10:48,431 --> 00:10:49,733
She was alone.

168
00:10:49,866 --> 00:10:51,501
That's not tragic, Sheriff,

169
00:10:51,635 --> 00:10:53,804
that's fucking horrifying.

170
00:10:53,937 --> 00:10:56,540
Look, I've been sport fishing
these waters for years,

171
00:10:56,673 --> 00:10:58,842
I built a respectable business
around it.

172
00:10:58,975 --> 00:11:01,378
I know these waters and
there's something I've learned.

173
00:11:01,511 --> 00:11:03,071
I'm gonna let you in
on a little secret.

174
00:11:03,146 --> 00:11:07,317
When a shark tastes something
it likes, it doesn't leave.

175
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:09,686
You know what I'm saying, Kula?

176
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:10,821
[gentle music]

177
00:11:10,954 --> 00:11:12,956
I do understand
what you're saying.

178
00:11:14,357 --> 00:11:16,726
We're doing the best we can,
Harlan.

179
00:11:17,527 --> 00:11:19,729
We're doing everything we can.

180
00:11:19,863 --> 00:11:22,233
We have to answer
to the City Council.

181
00:11:22,365 --> 00:11:24,034
- We gotta answer to the...

[dramatic music]

364
00:19:31,288 --> 00:19:32,556
[Sunny] Ooh.

365
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:34,023
Girl, what is that out there?

366
00:19:34,158 --> 00:19:35,592
I think that's a turtle.

367
00:19:36,327 --> 00:19:37,461
Oh, my gosh.

368
00:19:37,594 --> 00:19:39,896
This is just all so beautiful.

369
00:19:40,431 --> 00:19:41,465
Amazing.

370
00:19:42,899 --> 00:19:44,168
Thank you, Sunny.

371
00:19:44,601 --> 00:19:45,636
For what?

372
00:19:45,769 --> 00:19:47,371
For making me come on this.

373
00:19:47,504 --> 00:19:50,741
Oh, you thought I was gonna
let you sit at home

374
00:19:50,873 --> 00:19:52,276
and sulk all by yourself.
Mm-mmm.

375
00:19:52,409 --> 00:19:54,249
Girl, if you gonna sulk
and be in a pity party,

376
00:19:54,345 --> 00:19:55,612
you better do it right here.

377
00:19:55,746 --> 00:19:57,181
[both laughing]

378
00:19:57,314 --> 00:19:59,249
Seriously though, thank you.

379
00:20:00,284 --> 00:20:02,219
No problem,
you know you my girl.

380
00:20:02,985 --> 00:20:04,221
[gentle upbeat music]

381
00:20:04,355 --> 00:20:06,290
[Jessie] Hey, Wally,
where are we headed?

382
00:20:07,424 --> 00:20:09,193
I'm gonna take you
to a secret island.

383
00:20:09,326 --> 00:20:10,606
It's a small island with a reef,

384
00:20:10,661 --> 00:20:12,181
We're gonna anchor there
for the night.

385
00:20:12,262 --> 00:20:13,630
It's a really beautiful spot

386
00:20:13,764 --> 00:20:15,566
and hardly anyone goes there.

387
00:20:17,434 --> 00:20:18,168
Oh.

388
00:20:18,302 --> 00:20:19,636
Is there dolphins there too?

389
00:20:20,604 --> 00:20:22,004
By the end of this trip,

390
00:20:22,138 --> 00:20:23,949
you're gonna be sick
of the damn dolphins, trust me.

391
00:20:23,973 --> 00:20:25,209
Ay, see, that's my thing,

392
00:20:25,342 --> 00:20:27,678
he knows I wanna ride
the dolphins.

393
00:20:27,811 --> 00:20:29,346
My thing. This right here.

394
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,581
Okay.

395
00:20:30,714 --> 00:20:32,850
- They do that out here, I heard.
- [Jessie laughing]

396
00:20:32,982 --> 00:20:36,052
[suspenseful music]

397
00:20:41,525 --> 00:20:44,595
[Sam] Based on the bite radius
and the tear direction,

398
00:20:44,728 --> 00:20:47,431
can anyone identify
what type of shark this is?

399
00:20:47,564 --> 00:20:48,632
[gentle music]

400
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,801
No?

401
00:20:50,933 --> 00:20:52,202
How about this?

402
00:20:53,570 --> 00:20:55,938
That's a Carcharodon carcharias.

403
00:20:56,573 --> 00:20:57,574
That's right.

404
00:20:57,974 --> 00:20:59,209
Lights.

405
00:20:59,810 --> 00:21:01,378
Carcharodon carcharias,

406
00:21:01,512 --> 00:21:03,414
otherwise known
as the great white.

407
00:21:03,547 --> 00:21:05,816
The most feared predator
in the ocean, outside the orca.

408
00:21:05,948 --> 00:21:09,686
Which is also quite mysterious
in its own right, correct?

409
00:21:10,487 --> 00:21:12,523
Correct. Yes.

410
00:21:12,656 --> 00:21:16,125
The orca is, but the, um...
The species of the great white

411
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:17,994
has evaded scientists for years.

412
00:21:18,127 --> 00:21:19,797
W... W... Why is that?

413
00:21:19,929 --> 00:21:21,231
Oh, many reasons.

414
00:21:21,365 --> 00:21:22,900
First of all,
we don't quite understand

415
00:21:23,032 --> 00:21:25,369
their migratory
or their breeding patterns.

416
00:21:25,502 --> 00:21:26,904
We don't understand
why they travel

417
00:21:27,069 --> 00:21:28,906
thousands and thousands of miles

418
00:21:29,038 --> 00:21:31,208
over many different
oceans and seas.

419
00:21:31,341 --> 00:21:32,975
We've actually
never seen 'em mate.

420
00:21:33,109 --> 00:21:34,778
We don't know
when they fully mature.

421
00:21:34,912 --> 00:21:36,313
We don't quite understand
at times

422
00:21:36,447 --> 00:21:38,248
why they dive
to such great depths.

423
00:21:38,382 --> 00:21:40,451
By the way, if there's
deep water to be found,

424
00:21:40,584 --> 00:21:42,920
they're almost impossible
to track.

425
00:21:43,052 --> 00:21:44,621
[Harlan]
And why do they eat people?

426
00:21:47,023 --> 00:21:48,659
What makes 'em target people?

427
00:21:49,626 --> 00:21:51,495
[gentle music]

428
00:21:51,628 --> 00:21:53,897
Well, sometimes they
mistake a human being

429
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:55,265
for a food source.

430
00:21:55,998 --> 00:21:58,235
We're flesh and blood and bone.

431
00:21:59,001 --> 00:22:00,337
We are a food source.

432
00:22:00,471 --> 00:22:02,339
[gentle music]

433
00:22:02,473 --> 00:22:07,511
Well, that's true
but they prefer fish and seals.

434
00:22:07,644 --> 00:22:10,581
Oh, a cheap hamburger

435
00:22:11,682 --> 00:22:13,851
or a 32-ounce rib eye.

436
00:22:13,983 --> 00:22:15,519
Which one would you rather have?

437
00:22:16,787 --> 00:22:18,155
No offense.

438
00:22:19,756 --> 00:22:22,493
[gentle music]

439
00:22:22,626 --> 00:22:24,228
I think that's all for today,
class,

440
00:22:24,361 --> 00:22:26,095
if you'll excuse us, please.

441
00:22:28,465 --> 00:22:33,437
Harlan, I don't know
what to say, I'm sorry. I...

442
00:22:34,638 --> 00:22:35,739
Thank you.

443
00:22:36,573 --> 00:22:39,276
[sighs] It's been hard, Sam.

444
00:22:39,409 --> 00:22:40,878
You know, I lost my wife,

445
00:22:41,010 --> 00:22:43,814
but now losing my daughter...

446
00:22:43,947 --> 00:22:46,817
I mean, especially like this.

447
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:49,186
[gentle music]

448
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:50,721
What's this?

449
00:22:53,055 --> 00:22:54,324
Open it.

450
00:22:54,892 --> 00:22:56,560
[gentle music]

451
00:22:57,427 --> 00:22:59,329
I've been on the water
most of my life, Sam,

452
00:22:59,463 --> 00:23:01,632
and I've seen a lot of sharks.

453
00:23:04,835 --> 00:23:07,337
But I've never seen
anything that's done that.

454
00:23:07,471 --> 00:23:10,807
I thought maybe
you could help me identify

455
00:23:10,941 --> 00:23:12,643
the kind of shark that did this.

456
00:23:12,776 --> 00:23:14,578
[gentle music]

457
00:23:14,711 --> 00:23:16,145
Wait a second here.

458
00:23:17,848 --> 00:23:20,350
I thought she was attacked
on Kuina Beach.

459
00:23:20,484 --> 00:23:21,552
She was.

460
00:23:23,353 --> 00:23:24,855
Well, that's impossible.

461
00:23:25,289 --> 00:23:26,557
[Harlan] Why?

462
00:23:28,292 --> 00:23:31,461
Well, this ecosystem,
it supports warm water fish.

463
00:23:31,595 --> 00:23:33,931
And you know all the big sharks
that occupy this.

464
00:23:34,063 --> 00:23:35,432
Tigers.

465
00:23:35,566 --> 00:23:37,901
Tigers are the only sharks
we have around here

466
00:23:38,035 --> 00:23:39,870
that attack people on occasion.

467
00:23:40,003 --> 00:23:43,941
But you are not saying
that this was a tiger shark.

468
00:23:44,073 --> 00:23:45,442
[stammers] They...

469
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:51,782
These photos are... Well, they
look more like a great white.

470
00:23:52,683 --> 00:23:55,084
Great whites don't come
to these waters.

471
00:23:57,821 --> 00:23:59,189
It's not impossible.

472
00:23:59,323 --> 00:24:00,891
- It's not impossible.
- [Sam] No.

473
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:02,024
A couple years back

474
00:24:02,091 --> 00:24:03,427
a research team outta Woods Hole

475
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:04,828
tagged a great white female,

476
00:24:04,962 --> 00:24:06,296
they named it Lydia.

477
00:24:06,430 --> 00:24:08,265
She crisscrossed
the Atlantic back and forth,

478
00:24:08,398 --> 00:24:11,501
after about 35, 40,000 miles,
ended up in The Bahamas.

479
00:24:12,936 --> 00:24:15,137
Bahamas with tropical waters
and warm water?

480
00:24:15,272 --> 00:24:19,276
- Yeah, yeah.
- [Harlan] Hmm.

481
00:24:19,409 --> 00:24:20,944
There's a lot
about the great whites

482
00:24:21,078 --> 00:24:22,679
we still don't understand.

483
00:24:26,717 --> 00:24:29,118
Sam, my daughter's body
was found in pieces

484
00:24:29,252 --> 00:24:30,887
on the goddamn beach.

485
00:24:31,021 --> 00:24:32,856
[gentle music]

486
00:24:34,024 --> 00:24:35,168
Well, the majority of sharks,

487
00:24:35,192 --> 00:24:37,561
they kill for survival,
for food,

488
00:24:37,694 --> 00:24:41,298
and they eat their kill.
They don't leave it in pieces.

489
00:24:41,431 --> 00:24:43,867
So you're saying this thing's
killing for sport.

490
00:24:44,368 --> 00:24:47,604
[gentle music]

491
00:24:47,738 --> 00:24:49,673
[birds chirping]

492
00:24:49,806 --> 00:24:51,842
[gentle music]

493
00:24:57,447 --> 00:24:58,749
Yeah, so anyways, Brie

494
00:24:58,882 --> 00:25:00,851
couldn't even find her
way back to the hotel.

495
00:25:00,984 --> 00:25:02,352
Yeah, and then... and then,

496
00:25:02,486 --> 00:25:05,222
she starts yelling at this
German cab driver in English

497
00:25:05,355 --> 00:25:07,324
and then projectile vomits
all over the guy.

498
00:25:07,457 --> 00:25:10,460
Yeah, it was in his hair,
in his gear box, in the seats.

499
00:25:10,594 --> 00:25:12,105
Okay, thank you,
that's enough, thank you.

500
00:25:12,129 --> 00:25:16,066
I'm sure he liked his
stomach acid infused cologne.

501
00:25:16,199 --> 00:25:17,934
I've worn that scent
a time or two.

502
00:25:18,068 --> 00:25:20,370
So you guys have all known
each other for a while, huh?

503
00:25:20,504 --> 00:25:21,738
Quite a while, yeah.

504
00:25:21,872 --> 00:25:24,041
I've known Will and Sunny
the longest.

505
00:25:24,174 --> 00:25:25,742
No me, she's known me.

506
00:25:27,778 --> 00:25:30,080
And I met Brie and Emma
in college

507
00:25:30,213 --> 00:25:31,748
and Ty just...

508
00:25:31,882 --> 00:25:34,017
Just kinda drifted in
with the tide.

509
00:25:34,151 --> 00:25:35,151
And he never left.

510
00:25:35,218 --> 00:25:37,587
And there are no couples here.

511
00:25:37,721 --> 00:25:41,391
Whoo, Captain Wally, right down
to the nitty gritty, huh?

512
00:25:41,525 --> 00:25:43,727
Calm your hormones, Brie.
The man is taken.

513
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:45,338
- She's right here.
- I'm just saying.

514
00:25:45,362 --> 00:25:46,602
I didn't mean anything by that,

515
00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:48,398
I'm just saying
that mostly couples

516
00:25:48,532 --> 00:25:50,200
come down here, that's all.

517
00:25:50,333 --> 00:25:51,811
It's refreshing to see
a group of friends

518
00:25:51,835 --> 00:25:54,371
who have just been
that, you know? Friends.

519
00:25:55,305 --> 00:25:58,041
Well, actually,
Sunny and Ty dated once.

520
00:25:58,176 --> 00:26:00,977
[groans] Shut your mouth.

521
00:26:01,111 --> 00:26:04,314
Okay, listen, it didn't go well.
It's kinda gross,

522
00:26:04,448 --> 00:26:06,383
but it didn't.
Listen, it didn't.

523
00:26:06,516 --> 00:26:09,953
I was the, uh, test bunny,
Captain.

524
00:26:10,087 --> 00:26:11,388
You mean test dummy.

525
00:26:11,521 --> 00:26:15,625
- [all laughing]
- What about you, Wally?

526
00:26:15,759 --> 00:26:17,837
Have you always been out here
living the pirate life?

527
00:26:17,861 --> 00:26:20,530
Ah. If only,
I wish I was a pirate.

528
00:26:21,199 --> 00:26:25,335
No, I grew up in Minnesota.

529
00:26:25,836 --> 00:26:26,903
[Will] Oh.

530
00:26:27,671 --> 00:26:29,072
Yeah, I worked in a garage,

531
00:26:29,207 --> 00:26:31,175
fixing motors,
most of my young years.

532
00:26:31,308 --> 00:26:32,776
So what brought you down here?

533
00:26:33,677 --> 00:26:35,145
My cousin had a boatyard,

534
00:26:35,278 --> 00:26:36,446
I came down here one winter.

535
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:38,849
And that was that.

536
00:26:39,449 --> 00:26:41,418
So how did you two meet?

537
00:26:42,586 --> 00:26:44,054
It was actually
turtle mating season

538
00:26:44,188 --> 00:26:46,456
and a big guy thought I was like
the flavor of the week

539
00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:49,493
and it kept chasing me while
I was snorkeling in the water.

540
00:26:49,626 --> 00:26:51,695
And then big Wally came in there

541
00:26:51,828 --> 00:26:53,930
and he showed
that turtle dominance.

542
00:26:54,064 --> 00:26:55,999
- [Ty] That sounds kinky.
- Oh.

543
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:59,436
It definitely was not.

544
00:26:59,569 --> 00:27:01,972
So careers, change subject,
what do y'all do?

545
00:27:02,105 --> 00:27:03,507
I just graduated.

546
00:27:04,941 --> 00:27:05,976
I'm gonna get this.

547
00:27:06,843 --> 00:27:07,878
Uh,

548
00:27:09,045 --> 00:27:10,080
pre-med?

549
00:27:10,714 --> 00:27:12,048
- How'd you know?
- Got it.

550
00:27:12,183 --> 00:27:14,384
- What?
- Well you have that doctor look about you.

551
00:27:15,318 --> 00:27:16,318
And?

552
00:27:16,419 --> 00:27:19,022
[gentle music]

553
00:27:19,157 --> 00:27:20,991
We're all open books here.

554
00:27:21,124 --> 00:27:25,462
This one also takes care
of her mother. She's disabled.

555
00:27:26,264 --> 00:27:27,264
Oh, that's tough.

556
00:27:27,330 --> 00:27:28,598
- Will.
- Hmm.

557
00:27:28,732 --> 00:27:32,002
Oh. Oh, well,
I'm the sleaze of the group.

558
00:27:32,135 --> 00:27:34,371
Okay, okay.

559
00:27:35,572 --> 00:27:37,107
Club promoter?

560
00:27:37,241 --> 00:27:40,244
No, I'm a lawyer, litigation.

561
00:27:40,377 --> 00:27:41,478
Okay, cutthroat.

562
00:27:41,611 --> 00:27:43,089
Yeah, blood in the water
all the time.

563
00:27:43,113 --> 00:27:45,949
Shut up, Will.
No. It's not like that.

564
00:27:46,082 --> 00:27:47,082
What about you, Sunny?

565
00:27:47,185 --> 00:27:48,518
I work in real estate.

566
00:27:48,652 --> 00:27:50,353
There's nothing shiny
about that.

567
00:27:50,487 --> 00:27:53,047
I know my name is Sunny, but
it's not that shiny, you know. Yeah.

568
00:27:54,324 --> 00:27:55,992
I'm gonna grab some more wine.

569
00:27:56,126 --> 00:27:58,728
So what does tomorrow
bring for us, Captain Wally?

570
00:27:58,862 --> 00:28:02,166
Okay, so tomorrow I'm gonna
take you to that special island

571
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:03,400
I was telling you about.

572
00:28:03,533 --> 00:28:05,101
It's got amazing beaches,

573
00:28:05,236 --> 00:28:06,556
some out-of-this-world
snorkeling,

574
00:28:06,603 --> 00:28:08,872
gonna see turtles and dolphins.

575
00:28:09,005 --> 00:28:11,708
It's one of my favorite places
here in the islands.

576
00:28:11,842 --> 00:28:13,910
- And most importantly...
- Yes.

577
00:28:14,044 --> 00:28:15,612
...not a lot of tourists
know about it,

578
00:28:15,745 --> 00:28:17,547
'cause it's just
a little bit out of the way.

579
00:28:17,681 --> 00:28:19,149
Okay, well that sounds amazing.

580
00:28:19,283 --> 00:28:20,951
- It's magical.
- Yeah.

581
00:28:21,084 --> 00:28:23,321
[thunder rumbling]

582
00:28:23,453 --> 00:28:24,721
[gentle music]

583
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:31,494
[wind whistling]

584
00:28:33,463 --> 00:28:35,699
[dramatic music]

585
00:28:37,335 --> 00:28:39,536
[Kula] Harlan. Harlan!

586
00:28:39,669 --> 00:28:41,972
Harlan,
what do you think you're doing?

587
00:28:43,241 --> 00:28:44,574
Going fishing, Sheriff.

588
00:28:44,708 --> 00:28:46,843
Fishing with a goddamn rifle?

589
00:28:46,977 --> 00:28:50,046
Well, everybody has their
own way, Deputy Do-Right.

590
00:28:50,181 --> 00:28:52,449
That's illegal, Harlan.

591
00:28:52,582 --> 00:28:54,352
You're gonna stop me, Kula?

592
00:28:54,484 --> 00:28:55,952
[dramatic music]

593
00:28:56,086 --> 00:28:58,131
- I didn't think so.
- [Kula] Let me get this straight,

594
00:28:58,155 --> 00:28:59,675
you're gonna go cruise
all the islands,

595
00:28:59,723 --> 00:29:01,203
looking for the shark
that killed Jen?

596
00:29:01,325 --> 00:29:03,261
That's not how you do it.

597
00:29:03,393 --> 00:29:05,162
Well, if you would have
at least devised

598
00:29:05,296 --> 00:29:07,998
some kind of plan,
maybe I'd have listened to you.

599
00:29:08,131 --> 00:29:10,100
But you sat on your ass
and didn't seem

600
00:29:10,234 --> 00:29:11,635
to give a good government shit

601
00:29:11,768 --> 00:29:13,970
about the fact that there's
a rogue shark out there.

602
00:29:14,104 --> 00:29:15,839
So I guess I'm gonna have
to go out there

603
00:29:15,972 --> 00:29:19,109
and remind that goddamn fish
exactly where he is

604
00:29:19,243 --> 00:29:20,877
on the fucking food chain.

605
00:29:21,011 --> 00:29:23,046
[upbeat music]

606
00:29:28,219 --> 00:29:29,819
[Kula sighing]

607
00:29:31,488 --> 00:29:32,956
[boat engine revving]

608
00:29:38,262 --> 00:29:40,497
[gentle upbeat music]

609
00:29:42,832 --> 00:29:47,037
[people speaking indistinctly]

610
00:29:48,339 --> 00:29:50,106
You guys wanna see some sharks?

611
00:29:50,241 --> 00:29:51,241
Oh, shit.

612
00:29:51,342 --> 00:29:53,009
Wait, for real? Where?

613
00:29:53,143 --> 00:29:54,544
[gentle upbeat music]

614
00:29:55,011 --> 00:29:56,112
[Beth] What?

615
00:29:56,247 --> 00:29:59,216
Ahoy, hey, you assholes.

616
00:30:00,016 --> 00:30:01,651
See him throwing that line over?

617
00:30:01,785 --> 00:30:02,986
It's to attract sharks,

618
00:30:03,119 --> 00:30:05,655
which in these waters,
is extremely illegal.

619
00:30:06,257 --> 00:30:07,377
Why the hell would you wanna

620
00:30:07,457 --> 00:30:08,858
bring sharks closer to the boat?

621
00:30:08,992 --> 00:30:11,795
Tourists,
they pay big money for it.

622
00:30:13,663 --> 00:30:14,864
See that right there?

623
00:30:15,299 --> 00:30:16,299
[Emma] Oh.

624
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:18,101
It's a white tip reef shark.

625
00:30:18,235 --> 00:30:19,569
[Emma] Whoa.

626
00:30:19,703 --> 00:30:21,504
It's actually smaller
than I thought.

627
00:30:21,638 --> 00:30:23,174
Harmless, mostly.

628
00:30:23,873 --> 00:30:25,642
Should be more of that coming.

629
00:30:27,711 --> 00:30:29,213
There they are.

630
00:30:29,347 --> 00:30:30,448
So cool.

631
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:31,982
And they don't bite?

632
00:30:32,115 --> 00:30:34,951
I mean they bite, but you're
just not food for them.

633
00:30:36,619 --> 00:30:38,322
That, see that.

634
00:30:38,456 --> 00:30:39,456
Huh.

635
00:30:39,522 --> 00:30:41,691
There it is again, you see it?

636
00:30:41,825 --> 00:30:43,227
That's a small tiger shark.

637
00:30:43,361 --> 00:30:45,439
Now those are responsible
for most of the attacks here,

638
00:30:45,463 --> 00:30:48,631
but still that's not so common.

639
00:30:48,765 --> 00:30:50,767
Well, still, it's a small fish.

640
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:52,502
Oh, Will, are you trying to see

641
00:30:52,635 --> 00:30:54,738
like a really big, big fish,
a shark, what?

642
00:30:54,871 --> 00:30:57,073
I mean, no, I mean,
look, I've seen pictures,

643
00:30:57,208 --> 00:31:00,910
seen it on TV, and look,
they're huge, yeah.

644
00:31:01,044 --> 00:31:02,846
Getting pretty big down here.

645
00:31:02,979 --> 00:31:04,059
I've seen one before, Will.

646
00:31:04,181 --> 00:31:05,882
When I was snorkeling
in The Bahamas

647
00:31:06,016 --> 00:31:08,752
we had one cruising right
through us. They're beautiful.

648
00:31:09,487 --> 00:31:10,720
Sometimes you get one

649
00:31:10,854 --> 00:31:15,125
that swims close to shore,
but it's rare.

650
00:31:15,259 --> 00:31:16,826
How big do they get?

651
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,129
I don't know,
I've seen about a 15-footer.

652
00:31:19,263 --> 00:31:20,331
- Oh.
- God damn.

653
00:31:20,464 --> 00:31:22,132
- Now that is a big fish.
- Mmm.

654
00:31:22,266 --> 00:31:24,301
- They're a sight all right.
- Yeah.

655
00:31:25,935 --> 00:31:28,638
Once they understand that
there's food in the water,

656
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,673
they can hang out for hours.

657
00:31:30,807 --> 00:31:33,143
[gentle music]

658
00:31:33,277 --> 00:31:34,711
Sometimes days.

659
00:31:35,545 --> 00:31:37,781
[gentle upbeat music]

660
00:31:42,085 --> 00:31:44,388
- [Brie] Wow, it's beautiful.
- [Emma] Yeah.

661
00:31:44,522 --> 00:31:46,190
All right, here she is.

662
00:31:46,323 --> 00:31:48,734
- [Beth] Yeah, wait 'til you get off the boat.
- [Brie] Gorgeous.

663
00:31:48,758 --> 00:31:50,158
The reef in front of us
is protected

664
00:31:50,261 --> 00:31:52,363
and the water's too shallow
for a boat this size

665
00:31:52,496 --> 00:31:53,497
to go on through.

666
00:31:53,630 --> 00:31:54,964
So, Beth, can you do me a favor?

667
00:31:55,098 --> 00:31:56,666
- Can you get the raft?
- I can.

668
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,235
Thank you very much.

669
00:31:58,369 --> 00:32:00,870
[gentle upbeat music]

670
00:32:01,004 --> 00:32:03,374
Island's all yours
for the next 24 hours.

671
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:05,975
Nothing but peace and quiet.

672
00:32:06,109 --> 00:32:08,245
Now on the backside
of the island are some palapas

673
00:32:08,379 --> 00:32:10,347
with some fresh cots,
if you wanna sleep inside.

674
00:32:10,481 --> 00:32:13,250
But if you want my advice
and look at the stars at night,

675
00:32:13,384 --> 00:32:16,220
you want to go in front
of the beach right there.

676
00:32:16,786 --> 00:32:18,988
Go, go ahead, go.

677
00:32:19,122 --> 00:32:21,559
Go get some towels
and fresh blankets

678
00:32:21,691 --> 00:32:23,093
and pillows below deck.

679
00:32:23,227 --> 00:32:24,328
Enjoy yourselves.

680
00:32:27,164 --> 00:32:28,199
[Ty] Oh, yeah.

681
00:32:28,765 --> 00:32:30,934
[upbeat music]

682
00:32:31,067 --> 00:32:34,070
[people speaking indistinctly]

683
00:32:34,205 --> 00:32:36,673
[upbeat music]

684
00:32:36,806 --> 00:32:38,875
We are bringing more business.

685
00:32:42,979 --> 00:32:46,116
[Wally]
Honey, you wanna help me?

686
00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:48,285
[dramatic music]

687
00:32:57,093 --> 00:32:58,628
Hey, Jessie.

688
00:33:00,096 --> 00:33:02,132
Ain't you glad
you didn't bail on this now?

689
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:06,170
- It's not like I really had a choice.
- [Will] Yeah.

690
00:33:07,238 --> 00:33:08,472
Are you complaining?

691
00:33:08,606 --> 00:33:09,606
[Jessie] Not at all.

692
00:33:09,672 --> 00:33:11,808
Well, I think this is amazing.

693
00:33:11,941 --> 00:33:13,910
It's all of us together,

694
00:33:14,043 --> 00:33:16,347
turning a crap situation into...

695
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:19,283
♪ <i>Memories</i> ♪

696
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:23,621
So what's your mom
think about all this, Jess?

697
00:33:23,753 --> 00:33:25,121
- Brie.
- [Brie] What?

698
00:33:25,256 --> 00:33:26,256
I'm serious.

699
00:33:26,290 --> 00:33:27,724
Nobody's talking
about this shit.

700
00:33:27,857 --> 00:33:29,627
For good reason.

701
00:33:29,759 --> 00:33:31,060
No, it's fine. It's all right.

702
00:33:31,195 --> 00:33:32,929
You know my mom's
just as upset as me.

703
00:33:33,062 --> 00:33:34,365
She really liked Dave.

704
00:33:34,797 --> 00:33:35,932
Dave.

705
00:33:36,065 --> 00:33:37,635
- That's his name.
- [Jessie laughing]

706
00:33:37,767 --> 00:33:39,802
I'd forgotten it
about it already.

707
00:33:39,936 --> 00:33:41,505
- [dramatic music]
- Whoa.

708
00:33:41,639 --> 00:33:43,673
- What was that?
- [Will laughing] Um...

709
00:33:43,806 --> 00:33:45,108
What was that?

dolphins are a good sign.

Why? How? How so?

When dolphins are around
it means there's no danger.

- [Brie] Good.

- [Will] Yeah, that's right.

Oh, good. Well, that's good.
Good to know now.

Listen to me.

When you go ashore,
you stay on the beach,

792
00:37:16,387 --> 00:37:18,255
you do not go in the water.
Do you understand?

793
00:37:18,389 --> 00:37:23,660
Hey, look, so I can understand
just a little bit more,

794
00:37:23,794 --> 00:37:25,329
why can't he go in the drink?

off of blood in the water.

Okay? One drop of blood's
going to attract small fish,

798
00:37:32,669 --> 00:37:34,904
it's gonna attract
some even larger fish.

I don't wanna freak
you guys out.

800
00:37:36,707 --> 00:37:39,209
Just do me a favor and keep him
out of the water, understand?

801
00:37:42,646 --> 00:37:46,149
There, that should hold.

to see you too, Jack.

Jack, you fish these waters

even more than I do.

the bite's been bad,

00:38:46,410 --> 00:38:48,245
which is odd, you know.

Hey, you know, I know you
like to fish the shallows,

823

but you're usually out there
on the edge of the trench.

the hell in here today?

825

where this happened.

back to the boat,

off with another wench

Hello?

01:03:00,331 --> 01:03:01,665
Hello?

1263
01:03:02,532 --> 01:03:04,201
We are stuck on an island.

1264
01:03:05,468 --> 01:03:06,469
I can hear an engine.

1265
01:03:06,603 --> 01:03:08,438
I don't know the exact location.

1266
01:03:08,571 --> 01:03:09,973
There's a catamaran.

1267
01:03:11,474 --> 01:03:12,575
It's outside of the reef.

1268
01:03:12,709 --> 01:03:14,211
Please,
if you can hear me, please.

1269
01:03:15,679 --> 01:03:17,714
All right, I can hear you,
but I can't find you.

1270
01:03:17,847 --> 01:03:19,183
The tide's getting low.

1271
01:03:19,317 --> 01:03:21,127
I'm not gonna be able
to get around these reefs

1272
01:03:21,151 --> 01:03:24,288
if I take a wrong turn,
so you gotta help me out.

01:03:26,990 --> 01:03:29,526

01:03:29,659 --> 01:03:31,061
I don't know the exact location.

1277

We're outside
of inside the reef.

I'm assuming that that fish

1305
01:05:19,336 --> 01:05:21,938
is the reason
you're stranded on this beach.

Will tried to get out
to the boat.

1307

anything like that.

There's a girl
floating out there.

That's my friend.

1312
01:05:41,292 --> 01:05:42,992
Is this your friend too?

It's that fucking monster,
did this.

1316
01:05:52,436 --> 01:05:55,638
It's not a monster,
it's the devil.

1317

Devils don't bleed,

1318
01:05:57,941 --> 01:05:59,176
it's just a fish.

1319
01:06:01,312 --> 01:06:02,712
You the only survivor?

1320
01:06:03,214 --> 01:06:05,483
Yeah, I think so.

1321
01:06:05,615 --> 01:06:08,486
So it was just you
and these two?

1322
01:06:08,618 --> 01:06:10,920
No, there were seven of us.

1323
01:06:11,054 --> 01:06:12,088
Seven?

1324
01:06:14,057 --> 01:06:15,792
I think I'm the only one alive.

[gentle music]

1326
01:06:17,394 --> 01:06:19,230
Okay.

1327
01:06:19,363 --> 01:06:21,607
I'm gonna get on the radio and
I'm gonna call the coast guard,

1328
01:06:21,631 --> 01:06:25,001
they'll come get you,
take you back to the harbor.

1329
01:06:25,135 --> 01:06:26,695
I'd take you on my boat
but I don't know

1330
01:06:26,803 --> 01:06:29,105
if it can take much more
from that thing.

[waves crashing]

1332
01:06:34,711 --> 01:06:37,914
This is civilian charter,
the USCG.

1333
01:06:38,616 --> 01:06:39,816
I have any guard on this line?

1334
01:06:39,849 --> 01:06:40,984
I repeat,

1335
01:06:41,117 --> 01:06:43,887
civilian charter
in need of medical care.

1336
01:06:44,020 --> 01:06:46,323
Is there any coast guard
on this channel?

[Coast Guard]

<i>Richmond Lee, go ahead.</i>

1339
01:06:50,927 --> 01:06:52,996
I'm in Mokulua Island,
about two miles

1340
01:06:53,129 --> 01:06:57,168
off the Southwest side
of Dorsey Point.

1341
01:06:57,301 --> 01:06:59,869
I need urgent medical
attention immediately.

1342
01:07:01,137 --> 01:07:03,973
[Coast Guard] <i>Copy. What is</i>
<i>the nature of the emergency?</i>

1343
01:07:04,841 --> 01:07:06,343
There's been a shark attack.

1344

<i>please leave all channels open.</i>

1347
01:07:12,550 --> 01:07:13,816
Copy that.

[dramatic music]

1349
01:07:17,254 --> 01:07:19,290
[Jessie] Mister,
what were you doing out here?

1350
01:07:21,090 --> 01:07:22,326
My name's Harlan.

1351
01:07:23,092 --> 01:07:24,295
What's your name?

1352
01:07:24,428 --> 01:07:25,462
[Jessie] Jessie.

1353
01:07:26,664 --> 01:07:31,368
Well, Jessie,
that fish out there,

1354
01:07:32,169 --> 01:07:33,903
I believe it killed my daughter.

1355
01:07:34,371 --> 01:07:35,372
[dramatic music]

1356
01:07:36,072 --> 01:07:37,941
So I came out here to find it

1357
01:07:39,842 --> 01:07:41,212
and rid the world of it.

1358
01:07:41,345 --> 01:07:42,345
[dramatic music]

1359
01:07:42,413 --> 01:07:43,681
[waves crashing]

1360
01:07:43,813 --> 01:07:44,813
Well, it seems that shark

1361
01:07:44,881 --> 01:07:46,350
killed all of my friends.

1362
01:07:47,116 --> 01:07:49,085
So if you don't mind, Sir,

1363
01:07:49,220 --> 01:07:52,356
before I go home, I'd like
to see that thing fucking dead.

1364
01:07:55,858 --> 01:07:57,060
Okay, kid.

1365
01:07:57,561 --> 01:07:59,729
[upbeat music]

1366
01:08:05,636 --> 01:08:07,837
[birds chirping]

1367
01:08:09,973 --> 01:08:12,141
[gentle music]

1368
01:08:12,276 --> 01:08:15,546
So he circles
around the perimeter

1369
01:08:15,679 --> 01:08:18,982
and then comes back
to the center.

1370
01:08:19,115 --> 01:08:21,150
And that's where he goes down.

1371
01:08:21,285 --> 01:08:22,319
Right.

1372
01:08:22,453 --> 01:08:26,055
My guess is,
he can't get out of this bay

1373
01:08:26,190 --> 01:08:27,658
because of the low tide.

1374
01:08:28,292 --> 01:08:29,859
Can't get over that reef.

1375
01:08:29,993 --> 01:08:31,161
[gentle music]

1376
01:08:31,295 --> 01:08:35,031
And when he goes under there
in the center,

1377
01:08:35,165 --> 01:08:37,900
that has to mean
some dip in the sand there,

1378
01:08:38,034 --> 01:08:41,272
a trough or something,
where he can get some depth.

1379
01:08:41,405 --> 01:08:42,573
[gentle music]

1380
01:08:43,674 --> 01:08:49,045
All I need is just one good,
clean, shot, close range.

1381
01:08:49,647 --> 01:08:50,847
If I can get him in the brain,

1382
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:52,383
or better yet, in the gills.

1383
01:08:53,617 --> 01:08:55,519
So we need him to smile at us.

1384
01:08:55,653 --> 01:08:58,289
No, this fish,

1385
01:08:59,156 --> 01:09:00,524
he's a special one.

1386
01:09:01,258 --> 01:09:02,626
He's not hunting for food,

1387
01:09:02,760 --> 01:09:04,228
he's shown you that.

1388
01:09:04,361 --> 01:09:10,033
He's... He's playing,
like a cat plays with a mouse.

1389
01:09:12,369 --> 01:09:14,505
So we need to give it
something to hunt.

1390
01:09:15,539 --> 01:09:17,040
[waves crashing]

1391
01:09:17,174 --> 01:09:19,276
This island made you crazy,
Jessie.

1392
01:09:21,878 --> 01:09:25,148
You said that it dips right here

1393
01:09:25,282 --> 01:09:27,584
and then it goes down before
it gets to the dip, right?

1394
01:09:27,718 --> 01:09:28,752
[Harlan] Yeah.

1395
01:09:28,885 --> 01:09:30,554
So we need him
to swim across there

1396
01:09:30,688 --> 01:09:32,088
to make a straight attack.

1397
01:09:32,889 --> 01:09:34,090
Yeah.

1398
01:09:34,725 --> 01:09:35,992
That's what we need.

1399
01:09:36,794 --> 01:09:37,960
So that's where we kill him.

1400
01:09:38,094 --> 01:09:39,663
That's the kill hole.

1401
01:09:39,797 --> 01:09:41,565
That's it?

1402
01:09:42,899 --> 01:09:45,134
Do you think
you can wear him down?

1403
01:09:45,269 --> 01:09:47,638
You mean bleed him out?

1404
01:09:47,771 --> 01:09:49,239
Yeah.

1405
01:09:49,373 --> 01:09:53,444
Maybe, but if he takes a couple
more shots at my old boat,

1406
01:09:53,577 --> 01:09:55,746
I don't know
if she's gonna handle much more.

1407
01:09:55,878 --> 01:09:57,514

[dramatic music]

1409
01:09:59,383 --> 01:10:02,118
I can get him
to come straight to you.

1410
01:10:02,252 --> 01:10:04,588
Just need to position yourself
on the channel.

1411

01:10:05,789 --> 01:10:07,023

1436
01:11:52,396 --> 01:11:54,565
[gunshot]

1437
01:11:54,698 --> 01:11:56,333
[dramatic music]

1438
01:12:05,609 --> 01:12:08,345
Swim, girl, swim.

1439
01:12:08,479 --> 01:12:10,046
[gun firing]

1440
01:12:10,714 --> 01:12:13,015
[dramatic music]

[dramatic music]

1447
01:13:10,741 --> 01:13:11,775
Jessie.

1448
01:13:13,142 --> 01:13:14,378
Jessie.

1449
01:13:16,480 --> 01:13:19,750
Jessie, where are you kid?

1450
01:13:21,150 --> 01:13:22,553
[gasping]

1451
01:13:23,220 --> 01:13:24,655
[gentle music]

1452
01:13:27,157 --> 01:13:28,692
I thought I lost you.

1453
01:13:28,825 --> 01:13:30,126
Come on.

1454
01:13:33,030 --> 01:13:34,598
Yeah.

1455
01:13:34,731 --> 01:13:36,132
[gentle music]

1456
01:13:37,099 --> 01:13:39,169
Some vacation, huh?

1457
01:13:40,102 --> 01:13:42,406
It was supposed to be
my honeymoon.

1458
01:13:43,840 --> 01:13:45,175
I'm sorry about that.

1459
01:13:48,144 --> 01:13:49,580
[grunts]

1460
01:13:52,148 --> 01:13:57,354
My daddy used to say, "If
you feel like you need a drink,

1461
01:13:57,487 --> 01:13:59,356
you probably
shouldn't have one."

1462
01:14:02,359 --> 01:14:04,561
We're gonna make
an exception today.

1463
01:14:05,362 --> 01:14:07,598
[gentle music]

1464
01:14:10,167 --> 01:14:11,501
You did good.

1465
01:14:14,004 --> 01:14:16,138
[birds chirping]

1466
01:14:19,276 --> 01:14:21,244
[police sirens blaring]

1467
01:14:21,378 --> 01:14:24,181
[gentle music]

1468
01:14:31,755 --> 01:14:33,290
[Kula] Jessie,

1469
01:14:35,058 --> 01:14:36,426
we've called your uncle.

1470
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:38,462
He can't get here
'til tomorrow morning.

1471
01:14:39,429 --> 01:14:41,665
We can get you a hotel room
if you'd like.

1472
01:14:42,633 --> 01:14:44,167
[gentle music]

1473
01:14:44,301 --> 01:14:46,236
Did you get a hold of my mom?

1474
01:14:46,370 --> 01:14:47,838
Yes we did.

1475
01:14:48,305 --> 01:14:49,305
Is she okay?

1476
01:14:49,373 --> 01:14:50,607
She's fine.

1477
01:14:52,476 --> 01:14:55,078
There are some people
that we could call.

1478
01:14:55,212 --> 01:14:57,080
If you would like
to talk to somebody.

1479
01:14:57,214 --> 01:14:58,649
[Harlan] Nonsense.

1480
01:15:00,817 --> 01:15:03,654
She just needs some good company
and a good meal.

1481
01:15:04,153 --> 01:15:05,455
[gentle music]

1482
01:15:17,467 --> 01:15:23,440
My daughter,
she liked blueberry pancakes.

1483
01:15:23,940 --> 01:15:25,308
[gentle music]

1484
01:15:27,277 --> 01:15:28,845
You like blueberry pancakes?

1485
01:15:29,880 --> 01:15:31,281
[gentle music]

1486
01:15:33,417 --> 01:15:35,352
I do like blueberry pancakes.

1487
01:15:36,153 --> 01:15:37,587
[gentle music]

1488
01:15:39,523 --> 01:15:40,857
Let's get outta this cop shop

1489
01:15:40,991 --> 01:15:42,693
and get some blueberry pancakes.

1490
01:15:43,760 --> 01:15:44,861
[gentle music]

1491
01:15:47,364 --> 01:15:48,364
You know, Harlan...

1492
01:15:48,432 --> 01:15:49,700
Hey, you remember what happened

1493
01:15:49,833 --> 01:15:52,335
the last time
you led with that, right?

1494
01:15:53,437 --> 01:15:55,272
[gentle music]

1495
01:15:57,774 --> 01:15:59,676
[ukulele playing]

1496
01:16:30,640 --> 01:16:32,876
- Hey, Harlan.
- [music stops]

1497
01:16:34,578 --> 01:16:36,113
Long time no talk, Sam.

1498
01:16:36,246 --> 01:16:37,981
[Sam] Yeah. [chuckles]

1499
01:16:38,115 --> 01:16:39,783
Who the hell is this then?

1500
01:16:39,916 --> 01:16:41,351
Oh, this is Peter.

1501
01:16:44,688 --> 01:16:48,358
Harlan, you think we'd have
a little chat with you?

1502
01:16:51,895 --> 01:16:53,730
Well, for you, Sam,

1503
01:16:54,531 --> 01:16:55,966
I'll give you a few minutes.

1504
01:16:56,399 --> 01:16:58,268
[gentle music]

1505
01:17:10,647 --> 01:17:13,683
Sam, you know I'm not
a big fan of unfamiliar faces.

1506
01:17:13,817 --> 01:17:15,819
Yeah, I know that Harlan,
and I apologize.

1507
01:17:15,952 --> 01:17:19,890
But, well, I think you
should hear this man's story.

1508
01:17:20,690 --> 01:17:22,526
He's not a reporter, is he?

1509
01:17:22,659 --> 01:17:25,328
No, I wouldn't do that
to you. You know that.

1510
01:17:27,198 --> 01:17:28,431
Okay.

1511
01:17:29,466 --> 01:17:31,501
[waves crashing]

1512
01:17:31,635 --> 01:17:35,305
A friend of mine recently
told me about your exploits.

1513
01:17:36,840 --> 01:17:40,777
And he advised me that I might
be able to seek your help.

1514
01:17:42,045 --> 01:17:43,079
My help?

1515
01:17:44,282 --> 01:17:46,316
Well now you are
a bit of a legend.

1516
01:17:47,218 --> 01:17:48,218
Is that so?

1517
01:17:48,318 --> 01:17:49,452
[gentle music]

1518
01:17:49,586 --> 01:17:51,054
[waves crashing]

1519
01:17:52,256 --> 01:17:56,493
My family and I own a small
business in Southeast Asia,

1520
01:17:56,626 --> 01:18:00,697
in the islands,
a vacation getaway to be exact.

1521
01:18:01,898 --> 01:18:06,002
And recently
business has plummeted.

1522
01:18:08,972 --> 01:18:10,006
And...

1523
01:18:11,708 --> 01:18:14,477
Harlan, his son
was killed by a shark.

1524
01:18:15,478 --> 01:18:16,880
[waves crashing]

1525
01:18:18,615 --> 01:18:20,083
My condolences.

1526
01:18:21,017 --> 01:18:22,352
And I empathize with you

1527
01:18:22,485 --> 01:18:25,755
but how does this concern me?

1528
01:18:26,389 --> 01:18:27,524
Two other tourists

1529
01:18:27,657 --> 01:18:29,593
were vacationing
at our property.

1530
01:18:30,328 --> 01:18:31,828
They were also killed.

1531
01:18:32,896 --> 01:18:35,532
I believe all three of them
were killed by a shark.

1532
01:18:36,334 --> 01:18:37,335
[gentle music]

1533
01:18:37,467 --> 01:18:38,702
[waves crashing]

1534
01:18:38,835 --> 01:18:40,635
What are the local authorities
doing about it?

1535
01:18:40,737 --> 01:18:42,873
Well, they sent
a group of fishermen out.

1536
01:18:43,707 --> 01:18:45,675
A few days later,
no sign of anything.

1537
01:18:45,809 --> 01:18:48,044
Boat was sunk,
never found any bodies.

1538
01:18:49,180 --> 01:18:50,447
[waves crashing]

1539
01:18:51,047 --> 01:18:52,148
[gentle music]

1540
01:18:52,283 --> 01:18:56,152
Okay, so let me
get this straight.

1541
01:18:57,454 --> 01:19:00,891
You want me to kill
another big fish

1542
01:19:01,024 --> 01:19:02,024
in a part of the world

1543
01:19:02,125 --> 01:19:06,029
that I never really
wanted to go back to?

1544
01:19:07,864 --> 01:19:09,666
That's why you're here today?

1545
01:19:10,368 --> 01:19:12,535
Quite frankly, yes.

1546
01:19:12,669 --> 01:19:15,005
We live on such a remote part
of the island,

1547
01:19:15,138 --> 01:19:16,207
nobody's gonna help us.

1548
01:19:16,340 --> 01:19:17,641
And the locals are now talking

1549
01:19:17,774 --> 01:19:22,445
about whatever's
in those waters, is a spirit

1550
01:19:22,579 --> 01:19:24,581
coming back for vengeance.

1551
01:19:26,783 --> 01:19:28,919
Well,
that's just fucking stupid.

1552
01:19:29,052 --> 01:19:33,623
This was the last place
that I saw my daughter alive,

1553
01:19:34,158 --> 01:19:35,158
right here.

1554
01:19:35,592 --> 01:19:37,194
[waves crashing]

1555
01:19:40,264 --> 01:19:42,065
How old was your son?

1556
01:19:43,500 --> 01:19:44,768
[Man] He was 10.

1557
01:19:47,837 --> 01:19:53,443
And you say this fish
took down a boat?

1558
01:19:54,412 --> 01:19:55,645
Yes, Sir.

1559
01:19:56,613 --> 01:19:58,515
[dramatic music]

1560
01:19:59,317 --> 01:20:00,951
We're gonna need a bigger one.
