1
00:01:04,364 --> 00:01:05,695  X1:278 X2:440 Y1:375 Y2:405
I'm sleeping.

2
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:17,804  X1:275 X2:443 Y1:375 Y2:405
You're okay?

3
00:01:21,815 --> 00:01:23,715  X1:254 X2:463 Y1:336 Y2:398
- Get up, get up!
- No!

4
00:01:23,783 --> 00:01:25,944  X1:309 X2:408 Y1:375 Y2:405
You try.

5
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:31,416  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:336 Y2:404
Come on, this is gonna be
your big day.

6
00:01:32,826 --> 00:01:34,987  X1:214 X2:503 Y1:336 Y2:404
We don't want to miss
this opportunity.

7
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:42,929  X1:210 X2:508 Y1:336 Y2:404
- All right?
- Who's coming today?

8
00:01:45,538 --> 00:01:47,199  X1:203 X2:513 Y1:375 Y2:399
You know who's comin'.

9
00:01:49,042 --> 00:01:52,808  X1:216 X2:501 Y1:336 Y2:404
- Bobby. Bobby!
- We got to, we got to.

10
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:54,710  X1:288 X2:429 Y1:375 Y2:405
No! Bobby!

11
00:01:57,050 --> 00:02:00,247  X1:236 X2:480 Y1:375 Y2:403
Watch out! No, no!

12
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:16,295  X1:197 X2:519 Y1:375 Y2:405
April, you got to hurry up.

13
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:22,401  X1:211 X2:507 Y1:375 Y2:405
Okay, I'll be right there.

14
00:02:26,179 --> 00:02:27,510  X1:320 X2:397 Y1:375 Y2:405
April?

15
00:02:29,682 --> 00:02:30,842  X1:285 X2:433 Y1:375 Y2:405
I'm coming.

16
00:02:38,691 --> 00:02:39,851  X1:277 X2:442 Y1:375 Y2:399
Here I come.

17
00:02:58,945 --> 00:03:01,436  X1:295 X2:424 Y1:375 Y2:405
Joy? Joy?

18
00:03:07,387 --> 00:03:08,547  X1:311 X2:409 Y1:375 Y2:405
Honey?

19
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:25,330  X1:329 X2:390 Y1:375 Y2:405
Joy?

20
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:31,507  X1:297 X2:421 Y1:336 Y2:398
- Honey...
- Dad!

21
00:03:31,578 --> 00:03:34,570  X1:176 X2:544 Y1:336 Y2:404
Have you seen your mother?
I can't find your mother.

22
00:03:35,014 --> 00:03:36,345  X1:337 X2:381 Y1:375 Y2:399
No.

23
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:45,350  X1:254 X2:463 Y1:375 Y2:405
Where are you?

24
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:55,796  X1:231 X2:487 Y1:336 Y2:398
- Would you knock?
- Where is she?

25
00:03:55,868 --> 00:03:57,529  X1:237 X2:483 Y1:375 Y2:399
I don't know. Who?

26
00:03:58,671 --> 00:03:59,831  X1:274 X2:443 Y1:375 Y2:399
Your mother.

27
00:04:01,007 --> 00:04:02,565  X1:311 X2:409 Y1:375 Y2:405
Honey?

28
00:04:02,642 --> 00:04:03,870  X1:319 X2:400 Y1:375 Y2:399
Mom?

29
00:04:03,943 --> 00:04:05,433  X1:291 X2:428 Y1:336 Y2:404
- Mother?
- Mommy?

30
00:04:18,224 --> 00:04:20,556  X1:164 X2:552 Y1:375 Y2:405
Okay, everybody, let's move it!

31
00:04:39,912 --> 00:04:42,244  X1:247 X2:471 Y1:336 Y2:402
- You need this?
- Yeah, I think so.

32
00:05:20,286 --> 00:05:21,344  X1:316 X2:403 Y1:375 Y2:405
Bobby.

33
00:05:24,023 --> 00:05:25,183  X1:296 X2:422 Y1:375 Y2:399
Come on.

34
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:52,006  X1:280 X2:438 Y1:336 Y2:398
- Here.
- Uh-uh. No.

35
00:05:56,556 --> 00:05:58,046  X1:277 X2:441 Y1:375 Y2:403
Hot, hot, hot!

36
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:19,337  X1:152 X2:565 Y1:336 Y2:402
- It doesn't really matter anyway.
- Yes, it does.

37
00:06:19,412 --> 00:06:22,540  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:336 Y2:404
Bobby, they're probably not
even gonna come.

38
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:28,380  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:375 Y2:405
Hi, Mom. How you feelin'?

39
00:06:28,454 --> 00:06:30,285  X1:270 X2:448 Y1:336 Y2:404
- Great.
- That's good.

40
00:06:32,792 --> 00:06:35,022  X1:260 X2:458 Y1:336 Y2:404
- How'd I do?
- You did great.

41
00:06:35,094 --> 00:06:36,561  X1:210 X2:508 Y1:375 Y2:405
Thought you'd think so.

42
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:39,097  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:336 Y2:404
- Do you have your camera?
- Absolutely.

43
00:06:39,165 --> 00:06:40,632  X1:284 X2:435 Y1:336 Y2:404
- You sure?
- Positively.

44
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:41,860  X1:275 X2:443 Y1:375 Y2:399
Better check.

45
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:45,894  X1:170 X2:547 Y1:336 Y2:404
- I know it's here somewhere.
- What's taking so long?

46
00:06:45,972 --> 00:06:49,373  X1:190 X2:530 Y1:336 Y2:404
I'm just wondering if it isn't
completely selfish of her,

47
00:06:49,442 --> 00:06:51,569  X1:204 X2:513 Y1:336 Y2:404
asking us to come
all the way to New York.

48
00:06:51,644 --> 00:06:53,942  X1:157 X2:562 Y1:375 Y2:405
Should Mom even be traveling?

49
00:06:54,013 --> 00:06:56,504  X1:187 X2:532 Y1:375 Y2:403
Sweetie, if not now, when?

50
00:06:56,582 --> 00:07:01,076  X1:133 X2:586 Y1:336 Y2:404
It's just... I offered to make the meal,
but that would've been too easy.

51
00:07:01,154 --> 00:07:04,646  X1:110 X2:611 Y1:336 Y2:398
Honestly, Daddy, what makes her think
she can cook all of a sudden?

52
00:07:04,724 --> 00:07:07,192  X1:198 X2:519 Y1:336 Y2:404
I don't remember her
ever being in the kitchen.

53
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,750  X1:147 X2:571 Y1:375 Y2:405
And who got an "A" in Home Ec?

54
00:07:08,828 --> 00:07:11,126  X1:197 X2:520 Y1:336 Y2:404
And you know how proud
we are of that, honey.

55
00:07:11,197 --> 00:07:13,358  X1:159 X2:559 Y1:336 Y2:398
- Could you zip me up, please?
- Of course.

56
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:17,065  X1:227 X2:491 Y1:336 Y2:398
Okay, it's gotta
be here somewhere.

57
00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:20,435  X1:177 X2:540 Y1:336 Y2:404
- Honk the horn.
- I'm sure they'll be right out.

58
00:07:20,506 --> 00:07:22,906  X1:183 X2:534 Y1:336 Y2:404
- Honk the horn, please.
- We'll wake the neighbors.

59
00:07:22,975 --> 00:07:25,307  X1:203 X2:515 Y1:336 Y2:404
Screw the neighbors,
honk the goddamn horn.

60
00:07:26,512 --> 00:07:27,604  X1:271 X2:445 Y1:375 Y2:405
Mom, please!

61
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:30,605  X1:240 X2:479 Y1:336 Y2:404
Look, the zipper
is not the problem.

62
00:07:30,683 --> 00:07:32,275  X1:226 X2:490 Y1:375 Y2:405
Actually, it kind of is.

63
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:34,478  X1:225 X2:495 Y1:336 Y2:404
No, Dad, the zipper's
not the problem.

64
00:07:34,554 --> 00:07:37,045  X1:228 X2:488 Y1:375 Y2:405
April is the problem.

65
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:38,613  X1:177 X2:541 Y1:375 Y2:405
Okay, okay, here they come.

66
00:07:42,762 --> 00:07:45,128  X1:206 X2:512 Y1:336 Y2:398
- Hey. How you feeling?
- Great.

67
00:07:45,198 --> 00:07:47,291  X1:236 X2:482 Y1:336 Y2:404
- Nauseous, dizzy?
- I feel great.

68
00:07:47,366 --> 00:07:49,357  X1:236 X2:482 Y1:336 Y2:404
- How'd you sleep?
- I slept great.

69
00:07:49,435 --> 00:07:51,596  X1:191 X2:526 Y1:375 Y2:399
The camera... it's not here.

70
00:07:51,671 --> 00:07:52,831  X1:281 X2:438 Y1:375 Y2:405
Better hurry.

71
00:07:56,676 --> 00:07:58,667  X1:222 X2:496 Y1:336 Y2:404
You know, Mom,
all you have to say is,

72
00:07:58,744 --> 00:08:01,907  X1:203 X2:515 Y1:336 Y2:398
"I don't feel up to it,"
and we'll all understand.

73
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:03,642  X1:228 X2:490 Y1:336 Y2:404
- What now?
- Forgot my camera.

74
00:08:03,716 --> 00:08:06,480  X1:162 X2:556 Y1:336 Y2:398
- Oh, Jesus. Where's your tie?
- Do I have to wear a tie?

75
00:08:06,552 --> 00:08:08,884  X1:167 X2:551 Y1:336 Y2:402
- You did not just ask me that.
- No, sir.

76
00:08:09,956 --> 00:08:10,980  X1:273 X2:443 Y1:375 Y2:399
You realize...

77
00:08:13,226 --> 00:08:16,389  X1:139 X2:579 Y1:336 Y2:404
- this could very likely be the last...
- Dad, your breath.

78
00:08:17,296 --> 00:08:19,127  X1:163 X2:556 Y1:336 Y2:398
- No numbness or discomfort?
- No.

79
00:08:19,198 --> 00:08:20,290  X1:268 X2:450 Y1:336 Y2:398
- Headaches?
- No.

80
00:08:20,366 --> 00:08:22,630  X1:199 X2:519 Y1:336 Y2:404
- Nauseous, dizzy?
- You asked that already.

81
00:08:22,702 --> 00:08:25,000  X1:219 X2:497 Y1:336 Y2:404
All you have to say is,
"I don't feel up to it."

82
00:08:25,071 --> 00:08:26,561  X1:210 X2:510 Y1:375 Y2:405
Is that all I have to say?

83
00:08:27,306 --> 00:08:29,035  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:375 Y2:405
Do you feel sweaty, clammy?

84
00:08:29,108 --> 00:08:31,770  X1:177 X2:540 Y1:336 Y2:404
Are your hands cold, warm?
Are your fingers tingly?

85
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:34,244  X1:161 X2:557 Y1:336 Y2:404
- Because all you have to say...
- Beth, shut up.

86
00:08:35,248 --> 00:08:37,409  X1:224 X2:495 Y1:336 Y2:404
Morning, honey.
How are you feeling?

87
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:40,876  X1:231 X2:487 Y1:336 Y2:404
You can never have
enough silverware.

88
00:08:42,054 --> 00:08:43,385  X1:226 X2:492 Y1:375 Y2:405
Look at these plates.

89
00:08:44,757 --> 00:08:45,917  X1:192 X2:525 Y1:375 Y2:405
Where did you get these?

90
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,291  X1:185 X2:533 Y1:375 Y2:405
Those are salt and pepper.

91
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:51,523  X1:195 X2:522 Y1:336 Y2:404
I know what they're for.
Where did you get them?

92
00:08:51,597 --> 00:08:52,996  X1:261 X2:458 Y1:375 Y2:399
From the store.

93
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:57,196  X1:153 X2:564 Y1:375 Y2:399
We had these when I was a kid.

94
00:08:59,572 --> 00:09:01,733  X1:158 X2:559 Y1:336 Y2:404
The one time
Joy let me hold them, she said,

95
00:09:01,807 --> 00:09:03,968  X1:193 X2:525 Y1:336 Y2:404
"Be careful. They're worth
more than you are."

96
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:06,041  X1:266 X2:452 Y1:375 Y2:399
That's terrible.

97
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:08,536  X1:189 X2:529 Y1:375 Y2:405
Next yea r, t hey were gohe

98
00:09:09,982 --> 00:09:11,006  X1:227 X2:492 Y1:375 Y2:405
So, what happened?

99
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:14,944  X1:202 X2:515 Y1:336 Y2:398
A hammer I was holding
fell on them.

100
00:09:19,258 --> 00:09:20,418  X1:319 X2:398 Y1:375 Y2:399
Good.

101
00:09:22,962 --> 00:09:24,793  X1:217 X2:503 Y1:375 Y2:405
How much were they?

102
00:09:25,865 --> 00:09:27,196  X1:260 X2:459 Y1:375 Y2:405
It wasn't cheap.

103
00:09:29,435 --> 00:09:31,266  X1:198 X2:522 Y1:375 Y2:405
How much did they cost?

104
00:09:36,776 --> 00:09:38,266  X1:228 X2:489 Y1:375 Y2:405
They were 50 cents.

105
00:09:43,482 --> 00:09:45,313  X1:206 X2:510 Y1:375 Y2:405
You got yourself a deal.

106
00:09:57,129 --> 00:10:00,121  X1:213 X2:505 Y1:375 Y2:405
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

107
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:13,701  X1:226 X2:491 Y1:336 Y2:398
Hey, we've got
a lot of cookin' to do.

108
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:16,509  X1:254 X2:464 Y1:336 Y2:404
At 375 degrees
and fully stuffed,

109
00:10:16,582 --> 00:10:19,278  X1:189 X2:530 Y1:336 Y2:398
a 15-pound turkey
will take five hours to cook

110
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:21,877  X1:227 X2:490 Y1:336 Y2:404
if you figure
20 minutes a pound.

111
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:24,013  X1:217 X2:501 Y1:375 Y2:399
Leave an hour to cool.

112
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:27,287  X1:210 X2:509 Y1:336 Y2:404
- What are you saying?
- We got time.

113
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:39,631  X1:202 X2:515 Y1:336 Y2:404
Mashed potatoes, gravy.
Sweet potatoes...

114
00:10:39,705 --> 00:10:43,038  X1:198 X2:519 Y1:336 Y2:404
cut up, melt some butter,
sprinkle on brown sugar.

115
00:10:43,109 --> 00:10:45,703  X1:181 X2:538 Y1:336 Y2:404
Green bean casserole
made with green bean stuff,

116
00:10:45,778 --> 00:10:48,770  X1:165 X2:553 Y1:336 Y2:404
another dish made with
crushed crackers and oysters.

117
00:10:48,848 --> 00:10:50,179  X1:237 X2:481 Y1:375 Y2:399
Sounds hard... isn't.

118
00:10:50,249 --> 00:10:53,150  X1:207 X2:511 Y1:336 Y2:404
Just dot it with butter,
and right before baking,

119
00:10:53,219 --> 00:10:55,119  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:375 Y2:405
barely cover it with hot milk.

120
00:10:55,187 --> 00:10:58,020  X1:154 X2:563 Y1:336 Y2:404
Cranberry sauce... open the can,
pop it on a serving dish.

121
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:00,558  X1:223 X2:496 Y1:336 Y2:398
- How simple is that?
- What else?

122
00:11:00,626 --> 00:11:03,026  X1:146 X2:571 Y1:336 Y2:404
Waldorf salad made with apples,
celery, nuts, grapes,

123
00:11:03,095 --> 00:11:04,858  X1:205 X2:506 Y1:336 Y2:404
and the dressing
mixed with mayonnaise

124
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:07,262  X1:198 X2:520 Y1:336 Y2:398
and thinned with milk
or cream and sweetener.

125
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:12,066  X1:155 X2:564 Y1:336 Y2:404
Pumpkin pie... store-bought from
the very, very expensive store.

126
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:20,172  X1:213 X2:505 Y1:375 Y2:405
Okay, watch your step.

127
00:11:22,748 --> 00:11:24,739  X1:264 X2:454 Y1:375 Y2:405

00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:32,513  X1:207 X2:512 Y1:375 Y2:399

129
00:11:32,591 --> 00:11:35,560  X1:160 X2:558 Y1:336 Y2:402
- Mom!
- Beth, it's for me when I'm old,

130
00:11:35,628 --> 00:11:38,290  X1:235 X2:483 Y1:336 Y2:404
so I can always
remember this day.

131
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:39,695  X1:264 X2:454 Y1:375 Y2:405

132
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:42,299  X1:272 X2:445 Y1:375 Y2:399
Almost there.

133
00:11:43,502 --> 00:11:45,231  X1:260 X2:458 Y1:336 Y2:402
- There we are.
- Hi, Grandma.

134
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:51,104  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:375 Y2:405
I'm Beth, your granddaughter.

135
00:11:51,177 --> 00:11:53,645  X1:244 X2:474 Y1:375 Y2:405
Aren't you a love?

136
00:11:56,549 --> 00:12:00,212  X1:195 X2:523 Y1:336 Y2:404
- Hi, I'm Timmy.
- Timmy's your grandson.

137
00:12:02,455 --> 00:12:05,117  X1:232 X2:484 Y1:375 Y2:405
Well, you don't say.

138
00:12:16,669 --> 00:12:21,072  X1:207 X2:511 Y1:336 Y2:404
- I know you.
- Hi, Mom. Did you eat?

139
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:24,565  X1:235 X2:483 Y1:336 Y2:398
Hot, Jim.
Get whatever's hot.

140
00:12:25,611 --> 00:12:27,602  X1:185 X2:522 Y1:336 Y2:404
<i>Good morrhirhg</i>.
<i>Welcome to Krispy Kreme</i>

141
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,443  X1:213 X2:506 Y1:375 Y2:405
<i>May I take yourorder?</i>

142
00:12:29,515 --> 00:12:32,143  X1:199 X2:520 Y1:336 Y2:404
I'll have a vanilla-covered
cream-filled, please.

143
00:12:32,218 --> 00:12:34,152  X1:187 X2:530 Y1:336 Y2:404
- Can I get...
- And two glazed crullers...

144
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:36,984  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:336 Y2:404
Actually, I do want strawberry
with the powder on top.

145
00:12:37,056 --> 00:12:38,216  X1:197 X2:523 Y1:375 Y2:405
Do they have doughnuts?

146
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:40,451  X1:211 X2:508 Y1:336 Y2:404
Remember, everybody,
April is cooking.

147
00:12:40,526 --> 00:12:43,154  X1:214 X2:504 Y1:336 Y2:404
We'll need
an extra dozen glazed.

148
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:49,066  X1:226 X2:493 Y1:336 Y2:404
What do you think
about cloth napkins?

149
00:12:49,135 --> 00:12:51,365  X1:203 X2:515 Y1:336 Y2:404
- Think they'd be better?
- Paper is fine.

150
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:54,463  X1:169 X2:550 Y1:336 Y2:404
No, I'm worried that the paper
will feel kind of papery.

151
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:56,371  X1:242 X2:479 Y1:336 Y2:398
Do we have to talk
about this now?

152
00:12:57,943 --> 00:13:01,071  X1:151 X2:567 Y1:336 Y2:404
I could pick them up while
I'm out doin' that thing I gotta do.

153
00:13:01,147 --> 00:13:05,277  X1:155 X2:563 Y1:336 Y2:404
- You're going out?
- I gotta do that thing, you know.

154
00:13:05,351 --> 00:13:07,342  X1:226 X2:492 Y1:375 Y2:405
I think you'll like why.

155
00:13:09,088 --> 00:13:12,421  X1:201 X2:518 Y1:336 Y2:404
I want you to go out.
I want you to go out now.

156
00:13:12,491 --> 00:13:15,221  X1:179 X2:538 Y1:336 Y2:404
- But I wanna help.
- This is how you'll help me.

157
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:18,286  X1:157 X2:559 Y1:375 Y2:405
You go and do your thing and...

158
00:13:18,364 --> 00:13:20,798  X1:299 X2:418 Y1:336 Y2:404
- I'm fine.
- Really?

159
00:13:21,734 --> 00:13:25,067  X1:230 X2:490 Y1:336 Y2:404
Bobby, it's gonna be
easier without you.

160
00:13:38,417 --> 00:13:40,248  X1:292 X2:425 Y1:336 Y2:404
- I'm goin'.
- Bye.

161
00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:08,513  X1:247 X2:470 Y1:375 Y2:403
So, now tell me...

162
00:14:08,581 --> 00:14:11,744  X1:235 X2:484 Y1:336 Y2:398
how could anyone
not believe in God?

163
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:31,200  X1:144 X2:573 Y1:336 Y2:404
- There you go.
- They don't deserve decorations.

164
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:32,669  X1:246 X2:471 Y1:375 Y2:405
Yeah, but you do.

165
00:15:37,403 --> 00:15:38,392  X1:337 X2:381 Y1:375 Y2:399
No!

166
00:15:39,305 --> 00:15:40,636  X1:289 X2:429 Y1:375 Y2:403
No, no, no!

167
00:15:55,154 --> 00:15:56,280  X1:296 X2:422 Y1:375 Y2:399
Come on.

00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:47,832  X1:296 X2:422 Y1:375 Y2:405
Good job.

179
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:55,239  X1:318 X2:401 Y1:375 Y2:399
Hello?

180
00:17:05,491 --> 00:17:09,154  X1:169 X2:548 Y1:336 Y2:404
If you keep knocking like that,
you are going to wake me up.

181
00:17:09,228 --> 00:17:12,425  X1:153 X2:565 Y1:336 Y2:404
- That's the...
- You don't want to wake me up.

182
00:17:16,301 --> 00:17:17,563  X1:205 X2:513 Y1:375 Y2:405
If you want my opinion...

- Stay out of it.
- Did Dad even ask?

185
00:17:22,508 --> 00:17:26,000  X1:214 X2:503 Y1:336 Y2:404
- I'm not talking to you!
- You always do this.

186
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:29,741  X1:142 X2:576 Y1:336 Y2:398
You should take charge
and turn this car around. This is...

187
00:17:29,815 --> 00:17:31,339  X1:290 X2:427 Y1:336 Y2:404
- Mom.
- Hey, you.

188
00:17:31,417 --> 00:17:33,078  X1:266 X2:451 Y1:336 Y2:402
- Here, let me.
- Beth, back.

189
00:17:33,152 --> 00:17:35,052  X1:197 X2:520 Y1:336 Y2:404
We were worried, honey.
Are you okay?

190
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,350  X1:233 X2:485 Y1:336 Y2:404
I'm good, honey.
I'm great, I feel fine.

191
00:17:37,423 --> 00:17:39,584  X1:205 X2:514 Y1:375 Y2:399
I'm the excited one now.

192
00:17:39,658 --> 00:17:40,818  X1:227 X2:492 Y1:375 Y2:405
Really? Why is that?

193
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:42,588  X1:262 X2:454 Y1:375 Y2:403
Well, let's see.

194
00:17:42,661 --> 00:17:45,095  X1:197 X2:521 Y1:336 Y2:404
- I have Fritos, Cheetos...
- No, Joy...

195
00:17:45,164 --> 00:17:47,598  X1:197 X2:520 Y1:336 Y2:404
- Oh, Timmy... Snowballs.
- No, stop it!

196
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:50,226  X1:207 X2:511 Y1:336 Y2:404
- Mom, a Nutter Butter.
- That's enough, stop it.

197
00:17:50,302 --> 00:17:51,599  X1:221 X2:498 Y1:375 Y2:405
It's not right... not now,

198
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:54,867  X1:169 X2:550 Y1:336 Y2:404
not when April is hard at work
making all your favorites.

199
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:58,774  X1:138 X2:578 Y1:336 Y2:404
Not when she called to check
the ingredients of a certain recipe.

200
00:17:58,844 --> 00:18:01,005  X1:229 X2:489 Y1:336 Y2:404
I'm nipping this
in the bud right now.

201
00:18:03,982 --> 00:18:06,815  X1:212 X2:506 Y1:336 Y2:398
I bet she called collect.
I will never call collect.

202
00:18:06,885 --> 00:18:09,649  X1:234 X2:484 Y1:336 Y2:404
Aren't you the most
perfect thing ever?

203
00:18:09,721 --> 00:18:12,212  X1:206 X2:513 Y1:375 Y2:405
Did someone say April?

204
00:18:13,525 --> 00:18:16,323  X1:190 X2:527 Y1:336 Y2:404
Yes, Grandma, she's your
other granddaughter.

205
00:18:16,395 --> 00:18:19,626  X1:207 X2:512 Y1:336 Y2:404
I know.
I thought she was dead.

206
00:18:19,698 --> 00:18:23,828  X1:155 X2:562 Y1:336 Y2:404
- Honey, don't. That's wasteful.
- Look, I'm gonna say this once.

207
00:18:23,902 --> 00:18:25,392  X1:315 X2:403 Y1:375 Y2:399
What?

208
00:18:25,471 --> 00:18:27,462  X1:240 X2:477 Y1:336 Y2:404
We're gonna have
a very nice time.

209
00:18:27,539 --> 00:18:31,134  X1:155 X2:563 Y1:336 Y2:404
- You don't actually believe that.
- It's possible, I think, yes.

210
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:34,907  X1:127 X2:590 Y1:336 Y2:404
- Well, you're a better man than me.
- That's funny. "Better man."

211
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:37,244  X1:227 X2:491 Y1:336 Y2:404
Don't get me wrong.
I'm glad we're going.

212
00:18:37,316 --> 00:18:40,911  X1:129 X2:588 Y1:336 Y2:404
This way, instead of April
showing up with some new piercing

213
00:18:40,986 --> 00:18:45,753  X1:134 X2:583 Y1:336 Y2:404
or some ugly new tattoo,
and... God forbid... staying overnight,

214
00:18:45,824 --> 00:18:47,655  X1:177 X2:539 Y1:375 Y2:405
this way, we get to show up,

215
00:18:47,726 --> 00:18:50,957  X1:159 X2:557 Y1:336 Y2:404
experience the disaster
that is her life, smile through it,

216
00:18:51,029 --> 00:18:53,429  X1:205 X2:512 Y1:336 Y2:404
and before you know it,
we're on our way home.

217
00:18:53,499 --> 00:18:56,935  X1:161 X2:557 Y1:336 Y2:402
- We don't know it's a disaster.
- I know. Believe me, I know.

218
00:18:57,002 --> 00:18:59,527  X1:287 X2:431 Y1:336 Y2:398
- Miss me?
- You bet.

219
00:18:59,605 --> 00:19:01,539  X1:202 X2:515 Y1:375 Y2:405
April's doing a lot better.

220
00:19:01,607 --> 00:19:04,405  X1:156 X2:561 Y1:375 Y2:405
She's had a couple of real jobs,

221
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:06,205  X1:199 X2:518 Y1:375 Y2:405
she's found a new place,

222
00:19:06,278 --> 00:19:08,576  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:375 Y2:405
Eddie the drug dealer is history,

223
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:12,344  X1:172 X2:545 Y1:375 Y2:405
and... she's met this new guy.

224
00:19:12,417 --> 00:19:13,884  X1:318 X2:399 Y1:375 Y2:399
Great.

225
00:19:13,952 --> 00:19:15,715  X1:181 X2:537 Y1:375 Y2:405
This guy sounds promising.

226
00:19:15,787 --> 00:19:17,721  X1:228 X2:489 Y1:336 Y2:404
- Is that so?
- Oh, yeah, he does.

227
00:19:18,557 --> 00:19:21,720  X1:223 X2:496 Y1:336 Y2:404
And why is that?
Tell us, please, why?

228
00:19:21,793 --> 00:19:25,752  X1:176 X2:541 Y1:375 Y2:405
Apparently, this guy Bobby...

229
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:27,321  X1:238 X2:481 Y1:375 Y2:399
reminds her of me.

230
00:19:43,549 --> 00:19:45,380  X1:148 X2:570 Y1:375 Y2:405
Eugene, somebody's at the door.

231
00:19:47,886 --> 00:19:49,046  X1:292 X2:425 Y1:375 Y2:399
Who is it?

232
00:19:49,121 --> 00:19:53,114  X1:245 X2:474 Y1:336 Y2:404
Hi, I'm in 3C.
I need some help.

233
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:54,181  X1:322 X2:398 Y1:375 Y2:405
Help?

234
00:19:59,064 --> 00:20:03,057  X1:217 X2:501 Y1:336 Y2:398
- Hi. I have a problem.
- Who is it?

235
00:20:03,135 --> 00:20:06,332  X1:192 X2:525 Y1:336 Y2:404
It's the new girl in 3C.
Says she's got a problem.

236
00:20:06,405 --> 00:20:08,805  X1:222 X2:487 Y1:336 Y2:404
- What?
- Problems, Eugene.

237
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:10,637  X1:206 X2:511 Y1:375 Y2:405
The girl's got problems.

238
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:14,076  X1:151 X2:566 Y1:375 Y2:405
She's white, she's got her youth,

239
00:20:14,146 --> 00:20:16,706  X1:208 X2:512 Y1:336 Y2:398
her whole privileged life
ahead of her.

240
00:20:18,317 --> 00:20:21,753  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:336 Y2:404
I am looking forward to
hearing about her problems.

241
00:20:37,102 --> 00:20:39,002  X1:204 X2:514 Y1:375 Y2:399
That's the short version.

242
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:42,165  X1:281 X2:435 Y1:336 Y2:398
- Oh, my.
- Goddamn!

243
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:45,438  X1:181 X2:538 Y1:336 Y2:404
If I told you the long version,
you wouldn't have cried.

244
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:47,273  X1:232 X2:485 Y1:375 Y2:399
And she's how old?

245
00:20:47,346 --> 00:20:50,338  X1:185 X2:534 Y1:336 Y2:404
She had me when she was
my age, so she's 42.

246
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:53,248  X1:284 X2:433 Y1:336 Y2:398
- I'm 42.
- You're 45.

247
00:20:56,054 --> 00:20:57,988  X1:262 X2:456 Y1:375 Y2:405
I can't imagine.

248
00:20:58,056 --> 00:21:00,923  X1:168 X2:549 Y1:375 Y2:403
The truth is, none of us know.

249
00:21:00,993 --> 00:21:03,325  X1:218 X2:501 Y1:336 Y2:404
Eugene here could be
chewin' on his supper

250
00:21:03,395 --> 00:21:06,728  X1:165 X2:553 Y1:336 Y2:404
and choke to death
on a turkey bone this very day.

251
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:07,856  X1:231 X2:485 Y1:375 Y2:405
We just don't know.

252
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:11,562  X1:125 X2:593 Y1:375 Y2:405
But to realize your time is almost up,

253
00:21:11,637 --> 00:21:14,936  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:336 Y2:404
and you have one last chance
to do the things you love,

254
00:21:15,007 --> 00:21:16,668  X1:177 X2:541 Y1:375 Y2:405
and be with those you love...

255
00:21:16,742 --> 00:21:18,073  X1:290 X2:426 Y1:375 Y2:399
Goddamn!

256
00:21:18,143 --> 00:21:21,306  X1:241 X2:476 Y1:336 Y2:404
You poor thing.
Your poor mother.

257
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:24,042  X1:302 X2:414 Y1:375 Y2:399
Yes. No.

258
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:26,277  X1:218 X2:500 Y1:336 Y2:404
You must have
a special relationship.

259
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:32,586  X1:165 X2:551 Y1:375 Y2:405
We do, yes. We're very close.

260
00:21:32,658 --> 00:21:35,024  X1:228 X2:490 Y1:336 Y2:404
More like sisters.
She's like, my best...

261
00:21:35,093 --> 00:21:37,084  X1:175 X2:542 Y1:375 Y2:405
You don't get along, do you?

262
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:41,158  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:375 Y2:403
No, not at all. Never have.

263
00:21:41,233 --> 00:21:43,360  X1:289 X2:428 Y1:336 Y2:398
- Oh, dear.
- Evette.

264
00:21:44,436 --> 00:21:46,267  X1:227 X2:491 Y1:375 Y2:405
I know, baby, I know.

265
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:50,668  X1:210 X2:509 Y1:336 Y2:398
Look, sweetie, we have
our own meal to make.

266
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,642  X1:212 X2:505 Y1:336 Y2:402
- I understand.
- But, wait, don't move.

267
00:21:53,712 --> 00:21:56,647  X1:185 X2:534 Y1:336 Y2:398
Tina's comin' with the boys
about 2:00?

268
00:21:56,715 --> 00:21:59,878  X1:141 X2:576 Y1:336 Y2:404
- That's right.
- And Glen will be late, as always.

269
00:21:59,951 --> 00:22:02,078  X1:216 X2:504 Y1:336 Y2:404
Do we even know
if Rasheed is coming?

270
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:04,418  X1:179 X2:539 Y1:336 Y2:404
- I know what you're thinkin'.
- 'Course you do.

271
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:06,081  X1:247 X2:472 Y1:336 Y2:398
You always know
what I'm thinkin'.

272
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:07,989  X1:279 X2:439 Y1:375 Y2:399
Here's what.

273
00:22:09,795 --> 00:22:13,060  X1:201 X2:516 Y1:336 Y2:404
We'll put off
cooking ours until 10:30.

274
00:22:13,131 --> 00:22:14,621  X1:216 X2:501 Y1:375 Y2:405
That'll get you started,

275
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:19,535  X1:129 X2:588 Y1:336 Y2:404
and then you'll have
two hours plus to find another oven.

276
00:22:19,604 --> 00:22:20,935  X1:241 X2:479 Y1:375 Y2:399
How's that sound?

277
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:43,494  X1:170 X2:548 Y1:336 Y2:404
- This yours?
- Yo, I got a message for you.

278
00:22:43,562 --> 00:22:45,462  X1:198 X2:520 Y1:336 Y2:404
- What?
- Tyrone's lookin' for you.

279
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:48,363  X1:183 X2:534 Y1:336 Y2:404
- I don't know no Tyrone.
- Yeah, well, he knows you.

280
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:05,709  X1:230 X2:487 Y1:336 Y2:404
This is a nice thing
you're doing for her.

281
00:23:05,784 --> 00:23:08,184  X1:202 X2:516 Y1:336 Y2:404
- Not really.
- It is. It's a nice gesture.

282
00:23:08,253 --> 00:23:10,915  X1:216 X2:503 Y1:336 Y2:404
- Isn't it nice, Eugene?
- I have a question.

283
00:23:10,989 --> 00:23:13,719  X1:197 X2:521 Y1:336 Y2:404
"Nice" writes letters,
"nice" goes home to visit.

284
00:23:13,792 --> 00:23:15,487  X1:137 X2:580 Y1:375 Y2:405
You mean you haven't been back?

285
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:18,961  X1:200 X2:519 Y1:336 Y2:404
- Hell, no.
- Not since she got sick?

286
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:22,227  X1:159 X2:559 Y1:375 Y2:405
It's... she likes it better that way.

287
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:24,700  X1:231 X2:486 Y1:336 Y2:398
- I don't believe you.
- Believe me.

288
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:27,534  X1:216 X2:501 Y1:336 Y2:404
- I'm the first pancake.
- What do you mean?

289
00:23:27,606 --> 00:23:29,733  X1:212 X2:505 Y1:336 Y2:404
She's the one you're
supposed to throw out.

290
00:23:29,808 --> 00:23:32,038  X1:204 X2:514 Y1:336 Y2:398
- Now I have a question.
- What?

291
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:33,634  X1:260 X2:459 Y1:375 Y2:405
Did you stuff it?

292
00:23:37,015 --> 00:23:38,846  X1:190 X2:530 Y1:375 Y2:399
Has the bird been stuffed?

293
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:42,216  X1:277 X2:442 Y1:336 Y2:398
- Yeah.
- With what?

294
00:23:42,287 --> 00:23:45,381  X1:158 X2:559 Y1:375 Y2:405
A... stalk of celery... I don't know.

295
00:23:45,457 --> 00:23:46,947  X1:267 X2:451 Y1:375 Y2:405
Celery's good.

296
00:23:47,025 --> 00:23:49,118  X1:260 X2:457 Y1:336 Y2:404
- Onion.
- Onion's good.

297
00:23:49,194 --> 00:23:51,788  X1:223 X2:493 Y1:336 Y2:398
Mostly it's just
the mix from the box.

298
00:23:54,332 --> 00:23:56,061  X1:156 X2:560 Y1:375 Y2:405
You used store-bought stuffing.

299
00:23:57,335 --> 00:24:00,270  X1:194 X2:524 Y1:375 Y2:405
Yeah. Is that a bad thing?

300
00:24:00,338 --> 00:24:02,602  X1:264 X2:454 Y1:375 Y2:403
No, it'll be fine.

301
00:24:02,674 --> 00:24:04,904  X1:167 X2:551 Y1:375 Y2:405
What was I supposed to use?

302
00:24:04,976 --> 00:24:06,967  X1:192 X2:526 Y1:336 Y2:398
I'm sure it's a great brand.
A fine brand.

303
00:24:07,045 --> 00:24:08,808  X1:129 X2:587 Y1:375 Y2:405
You don't use store-bought stuffing.

304
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,781  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:375 Y2:405
Please, Eugene, your first turkey.

305
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:14,683  X1:195 X2:523 Y1:336 Y2:398
Need I remind you
of that half-cooked affair?

306
00:24:14,753 --> 00:24:17,381  X1:223 X2:495 Y1:336 Y2:402
The meat all pink,
no flavor whatsoever,

307
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:20,289  X1:204 X2:513 Y1:336 Y2:404
and the next year,
your burnt the poor bird.

308
00:24:23,995 --> 00:24:25,394  X1:189 X2:529 Y1:375 Y2:405
You remember that, right?

309
00:24:26,731 --> 00:24:27,891  X1:220 X2:499 Y1:375 Y2:403
No, I don't remember.

310
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:31,231  X1:179 X2:539 Y1:336 Y2:404
That's why I'm here, baby,
so you don't forget anything.

311
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:34,864  X1:219 X2:500 Y1:336 Y2:398
Yeah? Thanks a lot.
Pass me them beans.

312
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:36,430  X1:195 X2:522 Y1:375 Y2:405
April, don't worry about it.

313
00:25:04,703 --> 00:25:07,035  X1:181 X2:538 Y1:336 Y2:404
Honey, what are you doing?
I don't need a map.

314
00:25:07,105 --> 00:25:09,630  X1:143 X2:574 Y1:336 Y2:404
- I want to take an alternate route.
- Dad knows the way.

315
00:25:09,708 --> 00:25:11,801  X1:213 X2:507 Y1:336 Y2:398
Back roads, see things
we've never seen.

316
00:25:11,877 --> 00:25:14,038  X1:189 X2:529 Y1:336 Y2:404
This way, the day won't be
a complete waste.

317
00:25:14,112 --> 00:25:16,672  X1:182 X2:535 Y1:336 Y2:404
- I hope we're not late.
- We don't want to be early.

318
00:25:16,748 --> 00:25:18,079  X1:210 X2:508 Y1:375 Y2:405
I'm giving you a choice.

319
00:25:18,149 --> 00:25:20,743  X1:220 X2:497 Y1:336 Y2:404
You can either let me
study the map...

320
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:24,552  X1:160 X2:558 Y1:336 Y2:404
or you can rely on
my uncanny sense of direction.

321
00:25:24,623 --> 00:25:26,955  X1:171 X2:547 Y1:336 Y2:404
- Which will it be?
- Uncanny sense of direction.

322
00:25:27,025 --> 00:25:28,014  X1:314 X2:404 Y1:375 Y2:405
Okay...

323
00:25:29,694 --> 00:25:30,854  X1:258 X2:459 Y1:375 Y2:399
Where are we?

324
00:26:22,347 --> 00:26:24,281  X1:223 X2:496 Y1:336 Y2:398
Careful now.
Don't let the heat out.

325
00:26:26,952 --> 00:26:28,112  X1:270 X2:449 Y1:375 Y2:399
How's it look?

326
00:26:29,521 --> 00:26:32,354  X1:250 X2:469 Y1:375 Y2:399
I... wouldn't know.

327
00:26:36,227 --> 00:26:37,888  X1:233 X2:484 Y1:375 Y2:405
What's he making?

328
00:26:37,963 --> 00:26:39,954  X1:177 X2:540 Y1:375 Y2:405
Tell her what you're making.

329
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:43,257  X1:197 X2:521 Y1:375 Y2:405
Nothing special this year.

330
00:26:43,335 --> 00:26:47,704  X1:185 X2:535 Y1:336 Y2:404
No. Just sweet potato soup
with buttered pecans,

331
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:51,173  X1:217 X2:502 Y1:336 Y2:404
herbed oyster stuffing,
giblet gravy,

332
00:26:51,242 --> 00:26:54,211  X1:125 X2:593 Y1:375 Y2:405
some lemon-rosemary green beans,

333
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:57,442  X1:126 X2:592 Y1:375 Y2:405
sautéed red Swiss chard with garlic,

334
00:26:57,515 --> 00:26:59,312  X1:218 X2:500 Y1:375 Y2:405
hickory nut ice cream,

335
00:26:59,384 --> 00:27:01,978  X1:204 X2:513 Y1:375 Y2:405
and maple pumpkin pie.

336
00:27:03,021 --> 00:27:06,081  X1:187 X2:530 Y1:336 Y2:404
- Wow.
- Nothing special this year.

337
00:27:06,157 --> 00:27:09,024  X1:246 X2:472 Y1:336 Y2:404
- Yeah, right.
- How about you?

338
00:27:13,865 --> 00:27:15,526  X1:261 X2:457 Y1:375 Y2:405
Turkey, gravy...

339
00:27:17,268 --> 00:27:18,326  X1:252 X2:465 Y1:375 Y2:399
a Waldorf salad.

340
00:27:18,403 --> 00:27:20,997  X1:219 X2:498 Y1:336 Y2:398
Waldorf salad.
That sounds unusual.

341
00:27:21,072 --> 00:27:25,406  X1:177 X2:543 Y1:336 Y2:398
It's made with different kinds
of fruits and nuts.

342
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:27,707  X1:198 X2:520 Y1:336 Y2:404
The dressing's
pretty much mayonnaise.

343
00:27:27,779 --> 00:27:29,872  X1:138 X2:580 Y1:375 Y2:405
Then mashed potatoes, of course,

344
00:27:29,948 --> 00:27:32,473  X1:223 X2:495 Y1:336 Y2:404
and cranberry sauce,
which is easy.

345
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:33,710  X1:240 X2:477 Y1:375 Y2:405
Just open the can.

346
00:27:35,186 --> 00:27:36,881  X1:278 X2:440 Y1:375 Y2:403
Oh, sweetie.

347
00:27:38,556 --> 00:27:40,421  X1:230 X2:489 Y1:375 Y2:399
I like it from the can.

348
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:43,154  X1:177 X2:542 Y1:375 Y2:405
Nobody likes it from the can.

349
00:27:51,369 --> 00:27:53,929  X1:200 X2:519 Y1:375 Y2:405
It was a squirrel, I think...

350
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:56,906  X1:205 X2:513 Y1:375 Y2:405
or a very small raccoon.

351
00:28:00,945 --> 00:28:03,937  X1:287 X2:432 Y1:336 Y2:404
- Jim?
- Yes, Joy?

352
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:06,910  X1:313 X2:405 Y1:375 Y2:405
Hop to.

353
00:28:14,793 --> 00:28:16,454  X1:203 X2:515 Y1:375 Y2:405
Mom's lookin' for a spot.

354
00:28:35,246 --> 00:28:37,612  X1:154 X2:563 Y1:375 Y2:405
We're sorry we didn't know you.

355
00:28:37,682 --> 00:28:40,810  X1:177 X2:540 Y1:375 Y2:405
We hope it was quick, and...

356
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:43,615  X1:271 X2:449 Y1:336 Y2:404
That's fine.
Beth, a song?

357
00:28:43,688 --> 00:28:44,848  X1:341 X2:385 Y1:375 Y2:399
No.

358
00:28:48,927 --> 00:28:51,259  X1:147 X2:571 Y1:375 Y2:405
I think Tim pretty much said it all.

359
00:28:51,329 --> 00:28:52,990  X1:165 X2:554 Y1:375 Y2:405
Then what are we waiting for?

360
00:29:00,004 --> 00:29:01,665  X1:200 X2:517 Y1:375 Y2:405
Okay, pour it in, sweetie.

361
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:05,699  X1:222 X2:496 Y1:336 Y2:398
That's it. Look at you.
You're a natural.

362
00:29:05,777 --> 00:29:06,766  X1:326 X2:401 Y1:375 Y2:405
Right.

363
00:29:06,845 --> 00:29:09,507  X1:199 X2:518 Y1:336 Y2:404
While we're waiting for it
to dissolve, you stir.

364
00:29:13,051 --> 00:29:14,882  X1:238 X2:477 Y1:375 Y2:405
Yeah. You go, girl!

365
00:29:14,953 --> 00:29:16,614  X1:236 X2:481 Y1:375 Y2:405
Stop it. It's nothing.

366
00:29:16,688 --> 00:29:18,349  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:375 Y2:405
Have you ever done it before?

367
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:20,584  X1:215 X2:503 Y1:336 Y2:404
- No.
- Then it's not nothing.

368
00:29:20,658 --> 00:29:23,456  X1:181 X2:536 Y1:336 Y2:398
- Excuse me. I just wanna...
- What's next?

369
00:29:23,528 --> 00:29:27,362  X1:154 X2:564 Y1:336 Y2:404
Next, we let it simmer
until it becomes a lovely texture.

370
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:31,334  X1:197 X2:521 Y1:336 Y2:398
- Please, could you just...
- Then we let it cool off.

371
00:29:31,402 --> 00:29:32,562  X1:262 X2:457 Y1:375 Y2:405
Ladies, please.

372
00:29:32,637 --> 00:29:35,333  X1:158 X2:560 Y1:336 Y2:404
Honey, please just
use your words and we'll move.

373
00:29:37,842 --> 00:29:40,834  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:336 Y2:404
Don't worry about Eugene.
He always gets a little fussy.

374
00:29:40,912 --> 00:29:44,211  X1:149 X2:570 Y1:336 Y2:398
- Any luck finding another place?
- I haven't even started.

375
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:46,113  X1:211 X2:508 Y1:336 Y2:398
- Probably the sooner...
- Evette.

376
00:29:46,184 --> 00:29:48,448  X1:202 X2:515 Y1:336 Y2:402
The sooner you find
another oven, the better.

377
00:29:49,254 --> 00:29:50,744  X1:228 X2:491 Y1:375 Y2:405
I'm coming, Eugene.

378
00:29:50,822 --> 00:29:52,881  X1:231 X2:487 Y1:336 Y2:404
- Don't worry. Done.
- Okay.

379
00:30:01,032 --> 00:30:06,561  X1:167 X2:551 Y1:336 Y2:404
Hi. Eugene and Evette in 2B...
do you know them?

380
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:10,233  X1:115 X2:603 Y1:336 Y2:404
They're helping me for the time being,
and I was just wondering if...

381
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:14,938  X1:198 X2:519 Y1:336 Y2:404
See, my family's coming,
and my mom, she's...

382
00:30:15,013 --> 00:30:16,674  X1:255 X2:463 Y1:375 Y2:405
It's complicated.

383
00:30:16,748 --> 00:30:21,242  X1:118 X2:600 Y1:336 Y2:398
Then the oven or the stove...
I don't know what it's called... started...

384
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:22,980  X1:321 X2:397 Y1:375 Y2:405
Sorry.

385
00:30:24,989 --> 00:30:26,923  X1:218 X2:499 Y1:336 Y2:402
The truth is,
she's a rotten mother,

386
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:29,687  X1:162 X2:554 Y1:336 Y2:404
so I don't even know why
you'd want to help me anyway.

387
00:30:29,761 --> 00:30:33,925  X1:183 X2:535 Y1:336 Y2:404
It's funny. My mother was
a mean woman, too. Nasty.

388
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:37,396  X1:196 X2:522 Y1:336 Y2:404
There wasn't a nice bone
in her body.

389
00:30:39,237 --> 00:30:42,729  X1:214 X2:504 Y1:336 Y2:402
She smoked non-stop,
cheated at cards,

390
00:30:42,807 --> 00:30:47,073  X1:228 X2:489 Y1:336 Y2:404
and she complained
every day of her life.

391
00:30:48,813 --> 00:30:51,145  X1:244 X2:474 Y1:336 Y2:398
- Sorry.
- You know what?

392
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:58,289  X1:112 X2:606 Y1:336 Y2:404
There's nothing I wouldn't do for
a chance to spend more time with her.

393
00:31:05,396 --> 00:31:06,727  X1:209 X2:510 Y1:375 Y2:405
So you'll help me then?

394
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:11,029  X1:245 X2:470 Y1:375 Y2:403
<i>Mi casa. Su casa</i>

395
00:31:22,981 --> 00:31:24,141  X1:326 X2:393 Y1:375 Y2:405
Help.

396
00:31:25,316 --> 00:31:28,308  X1:162 X2:555 Y1:336 Y2:404
Yo, Latrell, man, this is Bobby.
I'm at the spot.

397
00:31:28,386 --> 00:31:30,047  X1:270 X2:447 Y1:375 Y2:399
Call me back.

398
00:31:30,121 --> 00:31:35,787  X1:227 X2:492 Y1:375 Y2:399
I'm at 212-737-3858.

399
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:38,221  X1:305 X2:412 Y1:375 Y2:405
All right.

400
00:31:44,435 --> 00:31:46,733  X1:146 X2:570 Y1:336 Y2:398
This is great.
You don't know what this means.

401
00:31:46,804 --> 00:31:48,294  X1:226 X2:492 Y1:336 Y2:398
- It's such a big help.
- Good.

402
00:31:48,373 --> 00:31:51,536  X1:178 X2:539 Y1:336 Y2:398
- By the way, I'm April in 3C.
- Tish in 4A.

403
00:31:51,609 --> 00:31:54,942  X1:214 X2:503 Y1:336 Y2:404
Thank you, Tish in 4A.
Thank you, thank you.

404
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:58,107  X1:222 X2:496 Y1:375 Y2:405
My family thanks you.

405
00:32:04,889 --> 00:32:07,380  X1:263 X2:455 Y1:375 Y2:405
Okay, last one.

406
00:32:34,018 --> 00:32:36,350  X1:178 X2:540 Y1:336 Y2:402
There's our Christmas card.
Come on, Mom.

407
00:32:38,823 --> 00:32:42,486  X1:122 X2:597 Y1:336 Y2:404
- Without April?
- Since when was she in the picture?

408
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,391  X1:284 X2:431 Y1:375 Y2:399
Wait. Wait!

409
00:33:07,518 --> 00:33:08,849  X1:285 X2:433 Y1:375 Y2:405
I'm coming.

410
00:33:22,133 --> 00:33:23,464  X1:206 X2:510 Y1:375 Y2:405
You can keep the mitts.

411
00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:28,198  X1:210 X2:508 Y1:336 Y2:398
- Where's the strainer?
- Good luck.

412
00:33:28,272 --> 00:33:29,432  X1:307 X2:411 Y1:375 Y2:399
Thanks.

413
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:49,321  X1:155 X2:564 Y1:336 Y2:404
- Hi, it's just me.
- Can I talk to you for a second?

414
00:33:49,394 --> 00:33:51,487  X1:309 X2:409 Y1:336 Y2:398
- Sure.
- Alone.

415
00:33:57,201 --> 00:33:58,725  X1:279 X2:437 Y1:375 Y2:405
Yeah. Okay.

416
00:33:58,803 --> 00:34:01,169  X1:236 X2:482 Y1:336 Y2:404
There's something
I need you to know.

417
00:34:02,073 --> 00:34:04,405  X1:235 X2:484 Y1:336 Y2:398
I never eat anything
that has a face.

418
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:09,043  X1:140 X2:578 Y1:336 Y2:404
Don't worry, you won't be eating it.
I'll just be using your oven.

419
00:34:09,113 --> 00:34:11,980  X1:195 X2:524 Y1:336 Y2:404
But for me, that was once
a living, breathing soul.

420
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:15,144  X1:156 X2:562 Y1:336 Y2:404
- I'm a vegetarian. I understand.
- But I'm a vegan.

421
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:17,710  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:375 Y2:405
Even the smell of flesh cooking...

422
00:34:19,023 --> 00:34:20,513  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:375 Y2:405
I don't think I can help you.

423
00:34:32,837 --> 00:34:36,329  X1:189 X2:529 Y1:336 Y2:404
Latrell, man, this is Bobby.
I'm at the spot.

424
00:34:39,477 --> 00:34:41,308  X1:210 X2:509 Y1:375 Y2:405
Can anybody hear me?

425
00:34:41,379 --> 00:34:43,779  X1:221 X2:497 Y1:336 Y2:398
Does anybody have
a stove I can borrow?

426
00:34:43,848 --> 00:34:47,284  X1:237 X2:480 Y1:336 Y2:404
- Please?
- Try Wayne in 5D.

427
00:34:47,351 --> 00:34:49,376  X1:222 X2:496 Y1:375 Y2:405
He's got a new stove.

428
00:34:49,454 --> 00:34:50,944  X1:248 X2:469 Y1:375 Y2:405
Talk louder, lady.

429
00:34:51,789 --> 00:34:57,785  X1:222 X2:496 Y1:336 Y2:404
Try Wayne in 5D.
He's got a new stove!

430
00:34:57,862 --> 00:34:58,954  X1:288 X2:430 Y1:375 Y2:405
Thank you.

431
00:35:03,301 --> 00:35:04,791  X1:291 X2:428 Y1:375 Y2:405
Hey, babe.

432
00:35:04,869 --> 00:35:07,929  X1:165 X2:552 Y1:336 Y2:404
I'm just callin'
to see how everything is goin'.

433
00:35:08,005 --> 00:35:10,940  X1:196 X2:521 Y1:336 Y2:404
If you don't need me,
you don't have to pick up.

434
00:35:11,008 --> 00:35:14,569  X1:184 X2:534 Y1:336 Y2:404
<i>I'm just callirh' to make sure</i>
<i>you're doirh' firhe</i>

435
00:35:14,645 --> 00:35:15,805  X1:292 X2:423 Y1:375 Y2:405
<i>I love you</i>

436
00:35:17,982 --> 00:35:19,813  X1:321 X2:395 Y1:375 Y2:405
<i>Okay</i>

437
00:35:19,884 --> 00:35:22,546  X1:289 X2:429 Y1:375 Y2:399
I need this.

438
00:35:23,754 --> 00:35:28,350  X1:184 X2:533 Y1:336 Y2:404
- If I could borrow your...
- They don't speak English.

439
00:35:28,426 --> 00:35:29,916  X1:287 X2:432 Y1:375 Y2:399
I know that.

440
00:35:30,728 --> 00:35:35,165  X1:187 X2:530 Y1:336 Y2:404
- If I could borrow...
- You're wasting your time.

441
00:35:37,502 --> 00:35:38,992  X1:284 X2:434 Y1:375 Y2:399
Excuse me.

442
00:35:44,842 --> 00:35:45,866  X1:284 X2:434 Y1:375 Y2:399
Excuse me.

443
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:50,840  X1:251 X2:466 Y1:375 Y2:405
Are you Wayne?

444
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:56,484  X1:186 X2:531 Y1:375 Y2:405
Wayne with the new stove.

445
00:35:56,554 --> 00:35:59,614  X1:161 X2:557 Y1:336 Y2:398
Technically, it's a self-cleaning
convection oven.

446
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:02,523  X1:236 X2:482 Y1:336 Y2:402
It has an automatic
meat thermometer,

447
00:36:02,593 --> 00:36:06,256  X1:212 X2:505 Y1:336 Y2:402
audible preheat signal,
dual bake element,

448
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:09,629  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:375 Y2:405
hot surface lights, roasting rack,

449
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:11,531  X1:249 X2:469 Y1:375 Y2:405
and my favorite...

450
00:36:13,404 --> 00:36:15,804  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:375 Y2:405
the frameless glass oven door

451
00:36:15,873 --> 00:36:19,365  X1:172 X2:544 Y1:375 Y2:405
with deluxe big-view window.

452
00:36:20,111 --> 00:36:24,104  X1:235 X2:481 Y1:375 Y2:399
Wow. It's beautiful.

453
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:29,183  X1:298 X2:418 Y1:375 Y2:403
Yes, it is.

454
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:34,923  X1:162 X2:556 Y1:336 Y2:404
- I don't know how to ask this...
- Be my guest.

455
00:36:34,992 --> 00:36:37,222  X1:229 X2:489 Y1:336 Y2:404
- Really?
- We'd be delighted.

456
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:39,860  X1:285 X2:433 Y1:375 Y2:399
Bernadette.

457
00:36:39,931 --> 00:36:42,991  X1:175 X2:544 Y1:375 Y2:405
It's all right. She doesn't bite.

458
00:36:51,676 --> 00:36:53,166  X1:185 X2:534 Y1:375 Y2:405
Latrell, where you at, man?

459
00:36:53,244 --> 00:36:55,678  X1:218 X2:500 Y1:336 Y2:404
- <i>Where am I?</i>
- Yeah, where you at?

460
00:36:56,847 --> 00:36:59,179  X1:165 X2:556 Y1:336 Y2:398
<i>So the big marh warhts to krhow</i>
<i>where Latrell is</i>

461
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:01,241  X1:200 X2:519 Y1:336 Y2:404
Hell, yeah, I wanna know
where you at.

462
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:04,180  X1:289 X2:430 Y1:375 Y2:405
Right here.

463
00:37:04,255 --> 00:37:06,519  X1:177 X2:540 Y1:336 Y2:404
Where you been, man?
You're gonna make me late.

464
00:37:06,591 --> 00:37:09,719  X1:187 X2:531 Y1:336 Y2:404
- Where you been?
- I been standin' right here.

465
00:37:09,794 --> 00:37:11,227  X1:212 X2:507 Y1:375 Y2:405
Do we know a Tyrone?

466
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:14,355  X1:301 X2:417 Y1:336 Y2:404
- Tyrell?
- Tyrone.

467
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,061  X1:163 X2:555 Y1:375 Y2:405
Anyway, how far we got to go?

468
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:21,394  X1:282 X2:437 Y1:375 Y2:399
Here she is.

469
00:37:24,942 --> 00:37:26,466  X1:203 X2:514 Y1:375 Y2:405
You gotta be kiddin' me.

470
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:30,912  X1:161 X2:557 Y1:336 Y2:398
- You said you worked in retail.
- I didn't lie.

471
00:37:30,982 --> 00:37:32,142  X1:277 X2:441 Y1:375 Y2:405
Help me out.

472
00:37:36,621 --> 00:37:38,282  X1:212 X2:506 Y1:375 Y2:405
Quality men's clothes?

473
00:37:38,356 --> 00:37:41,553  X1:156 X2:561 Y1:336 Y2:404
You told me you can get me
a deal on quality men's clothes.

474
00:37:41,626 --> 00:37:44,959  X1:200 X2:519 Y1:336 Y2:398
You'll get some quality
men's clothes. Trust me.

475
00:37:46,163 --> 00:37:48,825  X1:259 X2:458 Y1:336 Y2:402
Trust you.
Come on, man.

476
00:37:52,236 --> 00:37:55,034  X1:189 X2:529 Y1:336 Y2:404
- I had you all wrong, man.
- You had me wrong.

477
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:57,267  X1:198 X2:521 Y1:336 Y2:404
'Cause I thought you was
the type of brother

478
00:37:57,341 --> 00:38:03,143  X1:128 X2:589 Y1:336 Y2:398
that ain't really need no fancy labels
or no Armani Prada bullshit.

479
00:38:03,214 --> 00:38:04,806  X1:226 X2:492 Y1:375 Y2:403
Get outta here, man.

480
00:38:04,882 --> 00:38:06,941  X1:197 X2:521 Y1:336 Y2:404
Ninety percent
of the people in the world

481
00:38:07,018 --> 00:38:08,747  X1:145 X2:571 Y1:375 Y2:399
would love to have these clothes.

482
00:38:08,819 --> 00:38:12,380  X1:181 X2:535 Y1:336 Y2:404
What I'm tryin' to tell you is,
as long as it's useful,

483
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:14,117  X1:191 X2:526 Y1:375 Y2:405
as long as we can wear it,

484
00:38:14,191 --> 00:38:17,319  X1:203 X2:514 Y1:336 Y2:402
as long as people
that we love can wear it,

485
00:38:17,395 --> 00:38:19,056  X1:194 X2:524 Y1:375 Y2:405
it's gonna be on that rack.

486
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:20,961  X1:217 X2:501 Y1:375 Y2:405
So, best get to lookin'.

487
00:38:21,032 --> 00:38:23,830  X1:153 X2:563 Y1:375 Y2:405
Were I you, I'd start down there.

488
00:38:23,901 --> 00:38:26,893  X1:152 X2:565 Y1:336 Y2:404
Were I you, if I don't find nothin',
you better not be here.

489
00:38:27,238 --> 00:38:31,197  X1:234 X2:483 Y1:336 Y2:402
Pull over, Jim.
Pull over now, now!

490
00:38:31,275 --> 00:38:33,675  X1:240 X2:479 Y1:336 Y2:404
- Are you woozy?
- Do you feel sick?

491
00:38:33,744 --> 00:38:36,008  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:336 Y2:404
- Do you feel tired?
- Do you need some fresh air?

492
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:38,878  X1:169 X2:548 Y1:336 Y2:398
- Mom, you should probably...
- I'm fine.

493
00:38:38,949 --> 00:38:41,816  X1:263 X2:456 Y1:375 Y2:405
I'm fine. I just...

494
00:38:41,886 --> 00:38:44,719  X1:191 X2:525 Y1:336 Y2:404
It's just... I keep waiting
for a good time to tell you,

495
00:38:44,789 --> 00:38:47,417  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:375 Y2:405
but there's really no good time.

496
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:49,482  X1:200 X2:519 Y1:375 Y2:405
I need everyone to listen.

497
00:38:53,364 --> 00:38:54,854  X1:180 X2:538 Y1:375 Y2:405
I don't know how to say this.

498
00:38:58,369 --> 00:39:01,167  X1:199 X2:520 Y1:336 Y2:404
We need to discuss how
each of you... Oh, God...

499
00:39:01,238 --> 00:39:02,569  X1:247 X2:472 Y1:375 Y2:405
It's okay, sweetie.

500
00:39:06,877 --> 00:39:10,210  X1:249 X2:470 Y1:336 Y2:404
How each of you,
in your own way,

501
00:39:10,281 --> 00:39:12,408  X1:234 X2:485 Y1:375 Y2:405
is going to handle...

502
00:39:16,987 --> 00:39:20,320  X1:200 X2:519 Y1:336 Y2:404
discarding food without
letting our hostess know.

503
00:39:21,792 --> 00:39:24,852  X1:284 X2:433 Y1:336 Y2:404
Oh, please.
Joy, really.

504
00:39:26,864 --> 00:39:28,491  X1:222 X2:495 Y1:375 Y2:405
That's not very funny.

505
00:39:31,969 --> 00:39:33,903  X1:209 X2:510 Y1:375 Y2:405
Here's what I suggest...

506
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:40,203  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:336 Y2:404
Take a bite of whatever it is...
let's say the green bean casserole.

507
00:39:40,277 --> 00:39:43,804  X1:204 X2:515 Y1:336 Y2:404
Pretend to chew, cough,
bring napkin to mouth,

508
00:39:43,881 --> 00:39:46,782  X1:226 X2:492 Y1:336 Y2:404
spit food into napkin,
excuse yourself.

509
00:39:46,851 --> 00:39:49,046  X1:242 X2:477 Y1:375 Y2:405
Drop food in toilet.

510
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,280  X1:320 X2:399 Y1:375 Y2:399
Flush.

511
00:40:14,445 --> 00:40:17,608  X1:168 X2:550 Y1:375 Y2:405
Honey, roll it tighter next time.

512
00:40:20,351 --> 00:40:21,682  X1:281 X2:437 Y1:375 Y2:405
Sorry, Mom.

513
00:40:27,758 --> 00:40:30,921  X1:209 X2:509 Y1:375 Y2:405
Won't you tell me why?

514
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:39,492  X1:277 X2:441 Y1:375 Y2:405
Tell me why.

515
00:40:49,547 --> 00:40:51,538  X1:137 X2:580 Y1:375 Y2:405
The thing about Smack Daddy is...

516
00:40:51,615 --> 00:40:53,742  X1:256 X2:461 Y1:336 Y2:404
- Who?
- Smack Daddy.

517
00:40:53,818 --> 00:40:55,308  X1:231 X2:490 Y1:336 Y2:404
Have I ever heard of
Smack Daddy?

518
00:40:55,386 --> 00:40:57,377  X1:198 X2:520 Y1:336 Y2:398
He's a black singer, Dad.
You wouldn't know him.

519
00:40:57,455 --> 00:41:02,791  X1:169 X2:549 Y1:336 Y2:404
Oh, no, I never heard of...
James Brown or Barry White,

520
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:04,452  X1:251 X2:466 Y1:375 Y2:405
or Puffy the Dog.

521
00:41:04,528 --> 00:41:06,689  X1:270 X2:449 Y1:336 Y2:398
- May I finish?
- Please.

522
00:41:06,764 --> 00:41:10,632  X1:145 X2:572 Y1:336 Y2:404
The thing about Smack Daddy is,
you know with him,

523
00:41:10,701 --> 00:41:13,465  X1:214 X2:505 Y1:336 Y2:398
it's no one-night stand,
that it's forever.

524
00:41:13,537 --> 00:41:15,971  X1:243 X2:474 Y1:375 Y2:403
Millions want him,

525
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:19,942  X1:171 X2:548 Y1:336 Y2:404
but it's as if
he's only singin' to me... baby.

526
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:22,305  X1:232 X2:484 Y1:375 Y2:405
Age doesn't matter.

527
00:41:22,379 --> 00:41:25,212  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:336 Y2:404
He doesn't care that I'm old
and sick and falling apart.

528
00:41:25,282 --> 00:41:26,749  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:375 Y2:405
He sees my soul. He's not fickle.

529
00:41:26,817 --> 00:41:29,581  X1:234 X2:483 Y1:336 Y2:398
- He's there for me.
- Like Dad?

530
00:41:29,653 --> 00:41:31,484  X1:182 X2:535 Y1:375 Y2:405
Well, your father can't sing.

531
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:37,491  X1:169 X2:550 Y1:336 Y2:404
But Smack Daddy...
man alive, is he sexy, which...

532
00:41:39,029 --> 00:41:41,964  X1:192 X2:525 Y1:336 Y2:404
it does lead
to this whole sexual thing.

533
00:41:42,032 --> 00:41:43,522  X1:288 X2:430 Y1:375 Y2:403
I mean, it...

534
00:41:44,802 --> 00:41:48,397  X1:174 X2:543 Y1:336 Y2:398
does bring up
some sort of nice memories.

535
00:41:49,073 --> 00:41:52,236  X1:179 X2:540 Y1:336 Y2:402
- You mean with Dad, right?
- Him, too.

536
00:42:11,729 --> 00:42:12,889  X1:318 X2:401 Y1:375 Y2:399
Hello?

537
00:42:14,965 --> 00:42:16,125  X1:318 X2:401 Y1:375 Y2:399
Hello?

538
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:20,693  X1:260 X2:458 Y1:336 Y2:404
- What?
- Hello. It's you.

539
00:42:23,173 --> 00:42:26,006  X1:157 X2:562 Y1:336 Y2:404
I was knocking on a lot of doors
looking for you.

540
00:42:27,244 --> 00:42:28,734  X1:257 X2:459 Y1:375 Y2:405
Yours was ajar.

541
00:42:28,812 --> 00:42:31,337  X1:266 X2:453 Y1:336 Y2:404
Come in.
How's it goin'?

542
00:42:37,254 --> 00:42:39,586  X1:193 X2:526 Y1:375 Y2:405
No foreseeable problems.

543
00:42:39,657 --> 00:42:41,648  X1:228 X2:491 Y1:336 Y2:404
I was about to check
your turkey myself.

544
00:42:41,725 --> 00:42:44,319  X1:259 X2:458 Y1:336 Y2:404
Then I thought,
since it's yours,

545
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:46,386  X1:236 X2:482 Y1:336 Y2:404
maybe you'd prefer
to do the checking.

546
00:42:52,303 --> 00:42:55,966  X1:176 X2:542 Y1:336 Y2:404
I certainly could do it for you,
and will, if you'd like.

547
00:42:56,674 --> 00:42:58,141  X1:199 X2:519 Y1:375 Y2:405
Didn't want to presume...

548
00:42:59,777 --> 00:43:01,108  X1:221 X2:496 Y1:375 Y2:403
That's fine, whatever.

549
00:43:04,648 --> 00:43:06,240  X1:171 X2:547 Y1:375 Y2:405
It's a common misconception

550
00:43:06,317 --> 00:43:09,309  X1:197 X2:521 Y1:336 Y2:404
that you can just
stick a turkey in the oven.

551
00:43:09,386 --> 00:43:12,913  X1:147 X2:571 Y1:336 Y2:404
Turkey needs to be tended to,
he needs to be cared for lovingly.

552
00:43:12,990 --> 00:43:15,823  X1:198 X2:520 Y1:336 Y2:404
One must pay
close attention to poultry.

553
00:43:17,995 --> 00:43:19,155  X1:324 X2:393 Y1:375 Y2:399
Sure.

554
00:43:20,197 --> 00:43:21,357  X1:206 X2:511 Y1:375 Y2:405
So much can go wrong.

555
00:43:21,432 --> 00:43:26,802  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:336 Y2:402
A turkey can burn in places,
be overcooked, undercooked...

556
00:43:26,870 --> 00:43:29,464  X1:192 X2:526 Y1:336 Y2:404
which is a health hazard...
and what about basting?

557
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:32,634  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:336 Y2:404
Look, Wayne,
I'll be up in a second, okay?

558
00:43:36,747 --> 00:43:38,237  X1:248 X2:470 Y1:375 Y2:405
The second's up.

559
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:44,651  X1:213 X2:504 Y1:375 Y2:405
Just give me a minute.

560
00:43:50,194 --> 00:43:51,354  X1:296 X2:422 Y1:375 Y2:399
Tick-tock.

561
00:43:57,701 --> 00:43:58,963  X1:296 X2:422 Y1:375 Y2:399
Tick-tock.

562
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:11,910  X1:228 X2:489 Y1:336 Y2:398
- Wait. Here I come.
- I don't think so.

563
00:44:11,982 --> 00:44:15,145  X1:154 X2:564 Y1:336 Y2:404
Bernadette has a small bladder,
and if I don't get her outside...

564
00:44:15,219 --> 00:44:18,484  X1:171 X2:547 Y1:336 Y2:398
- Can't I just pop my head in?
- I'm afraid not.

565
00:44:18,555 --> 00:44:20,921  X1:246 X2:472 Y1:336 Y2:398
- I'll be real quick.
- No.

566
00:44:20,991 --> 00:44:24,688  X1:122 X2:595 Y1:336 Y2:404
Do you know that good feeling
that often comes from being helpful?

567
00:44:24,762 --> 00:44:28,391  X1:149 X2:569 Y1:336 Y2:404
- Yes.
- I'm not having that feeling here.

568
00:44:28,465 --> 00:44:30,660  X1:159 X2:561 Y1:375 Y2:405
Look, I'm sorry. I didn't realize...

569
00:44:30,734 --> 00:44:32,224  X1:257 X2:460 Y1:375 Y2:405
So I ask myself,

570
00:44:32,302 --> 00:44:36,102  X1:195 X2:521 Y1:336 Y2:404
"Wayne, it's very clear
what you're doing for her,

571
00:44:36,173 --> 00:44:38,038  X1:235 X2:483 Y1:336 Y2:404
but what are you
getting out of this?"

572
00:44:38,742 --> 00:44:41,836  X1:156 X2:561 Y1:336 Y2:402
I think you need to take
some time and think about that,

573
00:44:41,912 --> 00:44:45,040  X1:203 X2:514 Y1:336 Y2:404
so that maybe later,
you help me understand

574
00:44:45,115 --> 00:44:48,846  X1:120 X2:597 Y1:336 Y2:404
what I'm getting from this exchange...
if we can even call it an exchange.

575
00:44:48,919 --> 00:44:50,409  X1:198 X2:520 Y1:375 Y2:405
Come along, Bernadette.

576
00:44:55,693 --> 00:44:56,853  X1:256 X2:459 Y1:375 Y2:405
All crap, Latrell!

577
00:45:01,765 --> 00:45:03,096  X1:277 X2:441 Y1:375 Y2:405
Keep lookin'!

578
00:45:05,569 --> 00:45:08,231  X1:165 X2:551 Y1:375 Y2:405
These are pimp clothes, man!

579
00:45:08,305 --> 00:45:10,000  X1:263 X2:455 Y1:336 Y2:398
- Money green.
- No!

580
00:45:11,275 --> 00:45:13,266  X1:254 X2:464 Y1:336 Y2:398
- Lapel surprise.
- No!

581
00:45:14,144 --> 00:45:17,011  X1:269 X2:448 Y1:336 Y2:402
- Velvet.
- Hell, no! No!

582
00:45:18,082 --> 00:45:19,947  X1:145 X2:574 Y1:375 Y2:405
How am I supposed to wear this?

583
00:45:25,255 --> 00:45:29,248  X1:180 X2:537 Y1:336 Y2:404
Big man... look, I was savin'
this little number for myself,

584
00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:32,021  X1:187 X2:531 Y1:336 Y2:404
but I think
it's more your size, try that.

585
00:45:38,736 --> 00:45:40,704  X1:197 X2:521 Y1:375 Y2:405
What do you have there?

586
00:45:40,771 --> 00:45:45,174  X1:136 X2:582 Y1:336 Y2:402
These are some photos
I've taken of Mom, before and now.

587
00:45:45,242 --> 00:45:48,040  X1:154 X2:563 Y1:336 Y2:404
- How nice.
- I got a camera for my birthday.

588
00:45:48,112 --> 00:45:50,273  X1:210 X2:508 Y1:375 Y2:405
Timmy is very talented.

589
00:45:50,347 --> 00:45:54,010  X1:152 X2:565 Y1:336 Y2:402
- All of our children are talented.
- Yes, Beth's talented, too.

590
00:45:54,084 --> 00:45:56,075  X1:270 X2:448 Y1:375 Y2:403
Oh, how nice.

591
00:45:57,488 --> 00:45:59,547  X1:168 X2:549 Y1:375 Y2:405
Maybe this isn't the best time.

592
00:46:03,927 --> 00:46:09,388  X1:126 X2:591 Y1:336 Y2:404
- This was before.
- So I could remember them always.

593
00:46:09,466 --> 00:46:13,232  X1:218 X2:499 Y1:336 Y2:398
- Okay, that's enough.
- I think so.

594
00:46:13,303 --> 00:46:15,965  X1:237 X2:481 Y1:336 Y2:404
There's one more
I want to show you.

595
00:46:17,641 --> 00:46:18,801  X1:239 X2:478 Y1:375 Y2:399
Where's that one?

596
00:46:20,978 --> 00:46:23,242  X1:237 X2:480 Y1:375 Y2:405
This is my favorite.

597
00:46:25,349 --> 00:46:27,840  X1:203 X2:515 Y1:375 Y2:405
Look how the light and...

598
00:46:30,854 --> 00:46:33,288  X1:250 X2:470 Y1:375 Y2:399
...how the arm is.

599
00:46:35,125 --> 00:46:38,117  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:375 Y2:405
I think I prefer Beth's singing.

600
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:25,201  X1:308 X2:417 Y1:375 Y2:405
Wayne?

601
00:47:30,214 --> 00:47:32,205  X1:157 X2:562 Y1:375 Y2:405
Hey, you ever hear the phrase...

602
00:47:32,282 --> 00:47:34,978  X1:191 X2:526 Y1:336 Y2:398
"Beware the occasion
that warrants a new suit"?

603
00:47:35,052 --> 00:47:37,543  X1:207 X2:510 Y1:336 Y2:404
- Nope.
- I'm tellin' you, beware.

604
00:47:38,422 --> 00:47:39,912  X1:207 X2:509 Y1:375 Y2:399
You never been in love.

605
00:47:39,990 --> 00:47:43,323  X1:126 X2:593 Y1:336 Y2:404
I never been in love, and I don't want
to be in love, thank you.

606
00:47:43,393 --> 00:47:45,122  X1:227 X2:491 Y1:375 Y2:405
It does things to you.

607
00:47:46,563 --> 00:47:48,087  X1:291 X2:429 Y1:375 Y2:399
Like what?

608
00:47:48,165 --> 00:47:50,827  X1:191 X2:527 Y1:336 Y2:404
You do things you thought
you never could ever do.

609
00:47:52,202 --> 00:47:56,366  X1:155 X2:562 Y1:336 Y2:404
- My mama, God rest her soul...
- Lord, not another mama story!

610
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:58,408  X1:201 X2:517 Y1:336 Y2:398
- She was drivin'.
- Your mama can't drive.

611
00:47:58,475 --> 00:48:01,137  X1:145 X2:571 Y1:336 Y2:404
You didn't even know my mother,
and I pity you for that.

612
00:48:01,211 --> 00:48:03,441  X1:192 X2:524 Y1:336 Y2:398
You don't have to pity me.
You the one in love.

613
00:48:03,513 --> 00:48:06,346  X1:157 X2:560 Y1:336 Y2:404
Anyway, my mother was drivin',
and I was just a baby.

614
00:48:06,416 --> 00:48:09,385  X1:149 X2:567 Y1:336 Y2:404
The car flipped over, and I
was trapped underneath the car.

615
00:48:09,453 --> 00:48:11,785  X1:201 X2:516 Y1:336 Y2:404
You know what she did?
She lifted up the car.

616
00:48:11,855 --> 00:48:13,516  X1:263 X2:455 Y1:336 Y2:404
- Bullshit.
- I'm tellin' you.

617
00:48:13,590 --> 00:48:16,354  X1:178 X2:540 Y1:336 Y2:404
She lifted up the car,
and she pulled me to safety.

618
00:48:16,426 --> 00:48:18,690  X1:201 X2:516 Y1:336 Y2:404
She had this moment
of unbelievable strength,

619
00:48:18,762 --> 00:48:20,093  X1:227 X2:490 Y1:375 Y2:399
'cause she had love.

620
00:48:24,868 --> 00:48:26,699  X1:215 X2:503 Y1:375 Y2:399
That's what love does.

621
00:49:17,387 --> 00:49:21,790  X1:247 X2:470 Y1:336 Y2:402
- Bravo, bravo!
- Encore, encore!

622
00:49:21,858 --> 00:49:24,986  X1:258 X2:461 Y1:336 Y2:404
- Any requests?
- That you stop.

623
00:49:44,181 --> 00:49:47,173  X1:225 X2:494 Y1:375 Y2:405
I'm sorry. I'm terrible.

624
00:49:50,988 --> 00:49:52,148  X1:267 X2:450 Y1:375 Y2:405
Who are you?

625
00:49:52,222 --> 00:49:54,747  X1:228 X2:488 Y1:336 Y2:398
Don't start with that.
You know who I am.

626
00:49:54,825 --> 00:49:57,658  X1:180 X2:538 Y1:375 Y2:405
I know who you say you are,

627
00:49:57,728 --> 00:50:02,927  X1:182 X2:536 Y1:336 Y2:404
but my daughter is kind
and sweet and soft-spoken.

628
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,331  X1:273 X2:445 Y1:375 Y2:405
Not anymore.

629
00:50:05,068 --> 00:50:06,558  X1:215 X2:503 Y1:375 Y2:405
Then I don't know you.

630
00:50:27,024 --> 00:50:28,855  X1:304 X2:413 Y1:375 Y2:403
Oh, shit!

631
00:50:54,451 --> 00:50:56,282  X1:175 X2:543 Y1:375 Y2:405
Joy, honey, are you all right?

632
00:51:04,428 --> 00:51:06,157  X1:262 X2:457 Y1:375 Y2:399
I am so critical.

633
00:51:06,997 --> 00:51:09,329  X1:193 X2:526 Y1:375 Y2:405
It's one of my worst faults,

634
00:51:09,399 --> 00:51:12,664  X1:199 X2:520 Y1:336 Y2:398
and some of the reasons
for this are obvious.

635
00:51:12,736 --> 00:51:14,863  X1:167 X2:552 Y1:375 Y2:405
But why, I keep asking myself,

636
00:51:14,938 --> 00:51:17,702  X1:190 X2:526 Y1:336 Y2:404
why am I so hard,
for instance, on you, Beth,

637
00:51:17,774 --> 00:51:20,709  X1:175 X2:541 Y1:336 Y2:404
when, for years, you've been
the daughter of my dreams?

638
00:51:20,777 --> 00:51:22,745  X1:162 X2:555 Y1:375 Y2:405
You have. You know you have.

639
00:51:22,813 --> 00:51:26,613  X1:138 X2:579 Y1:336 Y2:404
Apart from your weight problems,
we're practically the same person.

640
00:51:26,683 --> 00:51:28,344  X1:173 X2:545 Y1:375 Y2:405
So why am I so hard on you?

641
00:51:28,418 --> 00:51:31,444  X1:135 X2:584 Y1:336 Y2:404
Forget the fact that you're
making the same mistakes I made,

642
00:51:31,521 --> 00:51:33,318  X1:151 X2:567 Y1:375 Y2:405
and I wish you'd make your own.

643
00:51:33,390 --> 00:51:37,349  X1:135 X2:585 Y1:336 Y2:404
But I think I'm hard on you because
we've had so many good times.

644
00:51:37,427 --> 00:51:40,157  X1:185 X2:532 Y1:336 Y2:404
And I think it's likely,
as this gets worse, Timmy,

645
00:51:40,230 --> 00:51:43,757  X1:155 X2:564 Y1:336 Y2:404
I'll be hard on you, too, because
we've had so many good times.

646
00:51:43,834 --> 00:51:47,497  X1:118 X2:600 Y1:336 Y2:404
So then, why am I hard on April
when we didn't have any good times?

647
00:51:47,571 --> 00:51:48,902  X1:210 X2:508 Y1:375 Y2:405
That's not true, though.

648
00:51:48,972 --> 00:51:52,806  X1:158 X2:559 Y1:336 Y2:404
For days, I've been trying
to think of nice April memories,

649
00:51:52,876 --> 00:51:54,741  X1:148 X2:570 Y1:375 Y2:405
and I can only come up with one.

650
00:51:54,811 --> 00:51:59,248  X1:176 X2:542 Y1:336 Y2:404
One vivid, beautiful memory.
There's gotta be more.

651
00:51:59,316 --> 00:52:02,012  X1:229 X2:490 Y1:336 Y2:404
- One can be a lot.
- Okay, what was it?

652
00:52:02,085 --> 00:52:03,143  X1:249 X2:470 Y1:375 Y2:405
It's not important.

653
00:52:03,220 --> 00:52:06,053  X1:222 X2:496 Y1:336 Y2:398
Like hell, it's not.
Tell us. What was it?

654
00:52:08,091 --> 00:52:11,185  X1:153 X2:564 Y1:375 Y2:405
Okay, she had just turned three.

655
00:52:11,261 --> 00:52:14,856  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:336 Y2:404
She was looking out the
picture window on Locust Street,

656
00:52:14,931 --> 00:52:19,095  X1:158 X2:560 Y1:336 Y2:404
and it was early in the morning,
but it was already sunny.

657
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:24,805  X1:125 X2:592 Y1:336 Y2:402
She was just gazing out the window,
and she turned back to me,

658
00:52:24,875 --> 00:52:31,644  X1:167 X2:552 Y1:336 Y2:404
and she said, "Oh, Mother,
don't you just love every day?"

659
00:52:34,317 --> 00:52:35,648  X1:271 X2:447 Y1:375 Y2:399
That was me.

660
00:52:38,755 --> 00:52:40,086  X1:318 X2:400 Y1:375 Y2:399
It was!

661
00:52:40,157 --> 00:52:43,092  X1:192 X2:524 Y1:336 Y2:398
April was six when
we lived on Locust Street.

662
00:52:44,427 --> 00:52:45,758  X1:280 X2:439 Y1:375 Y2:405
Is that right?

663
00:52:46,796 --> 00:52:49,822  X1:123 X2:593 Y1:375 Y2:405
Well, what about the crayon drawing

664
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:52,391  X1:193 X2:526 Y1:336 Y2:404
she did of the Mayflower...
the one you had framed?

665
00:52:52,469 --> 00:52:54,835  X1:234 X2:484 Y1:336 Y2:398
- That was me, too.
- Cut it out!

666
00:52:54,905 --> 00:52:57,897  X1:190 X2:530 Y1:336 Y2:398
I'm sorry, but it's important
that we're accurate here.

667
00:52:57,974 --> 00:53:00,306  X1:160 X2:558 Y1:336 Y2:404
- These are my memories, too.
- Are you sure?

668
00:53:00,377 --> 00:53:02,777  X1:217 X2:500 Y1:336 Y2:398
She's absolutely right,
God freakin' dammit.

669
00:53:02,846 --> 00:53:04,905  X1:185 X2:533 Y1:336 Y2:398
Just off the top of my head,
I have one.

670
00:53:05,916 --> 00:53:07,577  X1:157 X2:560 Y1:375 Y2:403
She was... I don't know how old,

671
00:53:07,651 --> 00:53:11,417  X1:227 X2:491 Y1:336 Y2:404
but she was wearing
a pink nightgown.

672
00:53:11,488 --> 00:53:12,819  X1:271 X2:447 Y1:375 Y2:399
That was me.

673
00:53:14,925 --> 00:53:17,553  X1:231 X2:487 Y1:336 Y2:404
- I'm kidding.
- Funny. Very funny.

674
00:53:17,627 --> 00:53:21,791  X1:196 X2:521 Y1:336 Y2:404
And I was coming back
from a trip, or maybe not,

675
00:53:21,865 --> 00:53:27,565  X1:198 X2:520 Y1:336 Y2:404
but I came into her room,
and she was sleeping...

676
00:53:27,637 --> 00:53:30,470  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:375 Y2:405
in her crib, and it was lovely.

677
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:33,976  X1:267 X2:451 Y1:336 Y2:402
- That's it?
- Yes, that's it.

678
00:53:34,044 --> 00:53:35,204  X1:275 X2:443 Y1:375 Y2:405
That's lovely.

679
00:53:35,278 --> 00:53:38,907  X1:129 X2:591 Y1:336 Y2:404
No, it's not. Your happiest moment?
She was asleep!

680
00:53:40,684 --> 00:53:42,879  X1:221 X2:498 Y1:336 Y2:404
I didn't say it was
my happiest moment,

681
00:53:42,953 --> 00:53:44,978  X1:184 X2:534 Y1:375 Y2:405
it's just what came to mind.

682
00:53:47,891 --> 00:53:49,882  X1:310 X2:409 Y1:336 Y2:398
Joy
Momh?

683
00:53:53,496 --> 00:53:54,656  X1:276 X2:440 Y1:375 Y2:405
Joy, watch...!

684
00:53:58,001 --> 00:54:00,526  X1:216 X2:503 Y1:336 Y2:404
- What are you doing?
- It's shitty, Jim.

685
00:54:00,604 --> 00:54:02,663  X1:235 X2:482 Y1:336 Y2:404
All I can remember
is the petulance,

686
00:54:02,739 --> 00:54:05,401  X1:220 X2:497 Y1:336 Y2:398
the shoplifting,
the fire in the kitchen.

687
00:54:05,475 --> 00:54:06,533  X1:203 X2:513 Y1:375 Y2:399
Which was an accident.

688
00:54:06,610 --> 00:54:09,306  X1:184 X2:533 Y1:336 Y2:404
Was it an accident the way
she used to light matches

689
00:54:09,379 --> 00:54:10,539  X1:201 X2:517 Y1:375 Y2:399
and throw them at Beth?

690
00:54:10,614 --> 00:54:13,583  X1:167 X2:551 Y1:336 Y2:404
Or the time she used a lighter
to trim Timmy's bangs?

691
00:54:13,650 --> 00:54:17,984  X1:133 X2:584 Y1:336 Y2:404
- Joy, come on.
- I mean, the drugs, the ingratitude!

692
00:54:21,258 --> 00:54:23,852  X1:163 X2:553 Y1:336 Y2:398
She bit my nipples
whenever I tried to breastfeed.

693
00:54:23,927 --> 00:54:25,258  X1:239 X2:478 Y1:375 Y2:403
Sweetie, come on.

694
00:54:25,328 --> 00:54:28,024  X1:190 X2:528 Y1:336 Y2:398
No wonder there's cancer.
She's the cancer.

695
00:54:28,098 --> 00:54:29,588  X1:249 X2:468 Y1:375 Y2:399
Get back in the...

696
00:54:31,868 --> 00:54:33,529  X1:232 X2:484 Y1:375 Y2:399
Get back in the car!

697
00:54:39,109 --> 00:54:40,940  X1:287 X2:430 Y1:375 Y2:405
Stop! Stop!

698
00:54:41,011 --> 00:54:42,410  X1:245 X2:473 Y1:375 Y2:405
What's going on?

699
00:54:43,947 --> 00:54:45,778  X1:151 X2:567 Y1:375 Y2:405
Mom needed to stretch her legs.

700
00:54:47,384 --> 00:54:49,443  X1:259 X2:457 Y1:375 Y2:405
Joy, stop. Stop!

701
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:53,018  X1:228 X2:491 Y1:336 Y2:404
I tried, okay,
but I can't go, I can't.

702
00:54:53,089 --> 00:54:56,081  X1:148 X2:569 Y1:336 Y2:404
I can't... I can't have
another bad experience with her.

703
00:54:56,159 --> 00:54:59,026  X1:220 X2:498 Y1:336 Y2:398
- It won't be like that.
- You don't know that.

704
00:55:00,163 --> 00:55:02,688  X1:181 X2:538 Y1:375 Y2:405
It's the whole point of going.

705
00:55:02,766 --> 00:55:05,462  X1:195 X2:521 Y1:375 Y2:405
We're making a memory.

706
00:55:05,535 --> 00:55:08,527  X1:185 X2:532 Y1:336 Y2:404
You're not listening to me.
I have too many memories!

707
00:55:08,605 --> 00:55:11,938  X1:156 X2:560 Y1:336 Y2:404
A good memory.
We're making something good.

708
00:55:13,977 --> 00:55:15,808  X1:257 X2:460 Y1:375 Y2:399
What if it's not?

709
00:55:15,879 --> 00:55:19,110  X1:235 X2:483 Y1:375 Y2:405
It will be. I promise.

710
00:55:19,182 --> 00:55:21,616  X1:180 X2:538 Y1:375 Y2:405
I promise it will be beautiful.

711
00:55:23,053 --> 00:55:24,213  X1:239 X2:481 Y1:375 Y2:405
How do you know?

712
00:55:26,389 --> 00:55:28,380  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:375 Y2:399
Because I told her it had to be.

713
00:55:32,195 --> 00:55:33,685  X1:267 X2:451 Y1:375 Y2:399
And if it's not?

714
00:55:34,764 --> 00:55:36,095  X1:257 X2:460 Y1:375 Y2:399
Then I'll kill her.

715
00:55:58,788 --> 00:55:59,948  X1:308 X2:408 Y1:375 Y2:405
Wayne!

716
00:56:05,562 --> 00:56:08,827  X1:149 X2:569 Y1:375 Y2:405
Hi. I'd like to report a kidnapping.

717
00:56:11,034 --> 00:56:13,264  X1:223 X2:497 Y1:336 Y2:404
I said I'd like to report
a kidnapping.

718
00:56:14,504 --> 00:56:17,439  X1:197 X2:521 Y1:336 Y2:404
This man who lives
in my apartment building,

719
00:56:17,507 --> 00:56:19,168  X1:169 X2:549 Y1:375 Y2:405
he's taken my turkey hostage,

720
00:56:19,242 --> 00:56:22,234  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:336 Y2:402
and he's had it for
over an hour now, and I can't...

721
00:56:23,913 --> 00:56:25,073  X1:294 X2:423 Y1:375 Y2:405
My turkey.

722
00:56:25,915 --> 00:56:30,079  X1:225 X2:492 Y1:375 Y2:405
Turkey. Turkey! Yes.

723
00:56:32,288 --> 00:56:35,724  X1:240 X2:476 Y1:336 Y2:404
No, look, I know...
that's why I called.

724
00:56:35,792 --> 00:56:38,488  X1:201 X2:515 Y1:336 Y2:402
You have to understand.
No, no, no!

725
00:57:31,347 --> 00:57:32,507  X1:306 X2:412 Y1:375 Y2:405
Bad girl!

726
00:57:35,852 --> 00:57:37,342  X1:252 X2:466 Y1:375 Y2:405
I want my turkey.

727
00:57:38,188 --> 00:57:40,520  X1:184 X2:533 Y1:336 Y2:404
- So this is the thanks I get.
- Give me my turkey.

728
00:57:40,590 --> 00:57:42,581  X1:218 X2:500 Y1:375 Y2:405
I'm looking for a word.

729
00:57:42,659 --> 00:57:45,093  X1:201 X2:517 Y1:336 Y2:404
Please give me
my stupid fucking turkey.

730
00:57:45,161 --> 00:57:46,992  X1:223 X2:494 Y1:375 Y2:405
Ah, yes, that's better.

731
00:57:47,063 --> 00:57:48,394  X1:280 X2:439 Y1:375 Y2:405
It's all yours.

732
00:57:49,833 --> 00:57:52,495  X1:171 X2:546 Y1:336 Y2:404
- You don't have to thank me.
- Don't worry.

733
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:56,633  X1:231 X2:487 Y1:336 Y2:398
- Thank Bernadette.
- What?

734
00:57:56,706 --> 00:57:59,539  X1:199 X2:519 Y1:336 Y2:398
Without her, we wouldn't
have found a solution.

735
00:57:59,609 --> 00:58:01,839  X1:145 X2:573 Y1:375 Y2:405
She prefers her meat lightly fried.

736
00:58:01,911 --> 00:58:04,402  X1:224 X2:493 Y1:336 Y2:404
Would sweetie like it
cut into little pieces?

737
00:58:15,258 --> 00:58:16,657  X1:248 X2:468 Y1:375 Y2:405
You're a bad girl!

738
00:58:17,393 --> 00:58:20,260  X1:228 X2:488 Y1:375 Y2:405
A very, very bad girl.

739
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:26,129  X1:286 X2:432 Y1:375 Y2:403
No, I'm not.

740
00:59:26,129 --> 00:59:28,120  X1:210 X2:507 Y1:375 Y2:399
Welcome to our home.

741
00:59:36,172 --> 00:59:38,504  X1:207 X2:511 Y1:375 Y2:405
Tyrone's lookin' for you.

742
00:59:53,156 --> 00:59:54,316  X1:212 X2:507 Y1:375 Y2:405
How you been, Bobby?

743
00:59:54,390 --> 00:59:56,517  X1:236 X2:482 Y1:336 Y2:402
- Eddie.
- No, Eddie's dead.

744
00:59:56,593 --> 00:59:59,426  X1:178 X2:540 Y1:336 Y2:404
- I'm sorry?
- Yeah. I changed my name.

745
00:59:59,495 --> 01:00:00,655  X1:257 X2:461 Y1:375 Y2:405
I'm Tyrone now.

746
01:00:02,332 --> 01:00:04,994  X1:178 X2:540 Y1:336 Y2:404
- So you're Tyrone?
- Yeah. I changed my name.

747
01:00:05,068 --> 01:00:08,060  X1:175 X2:542 Y1:336 Y2:404
Everybody else is changin'.
The whole world is changin'.

748
01:00:08,137 --> 01:00:10,628  X1:147 X2:571 Y1:375 Y2:405
My who e wor d, wh ch was Apr

749
01:00:12,976 --> 01:00:15,137  X1:248 X2:470 Y1:336 Y2:404
- I gotta get goin'.
- Hey, man.

750
01:00:17,246 --> 01:00:19,908  X1:183 X2:536 Y1:336 Y2:402
Even if I wanted to hurt you,
and I kinda do,

751
01:00:19,983 --> 01:00:22,679  X1:202 X2:516 Y1:375 Y2:405
I won't, so you can relax.

752
01:00:22,752 --> 01:00:24,583  X1:256 X2:461 Y1:336 Y2:398
- Thank you.
- It's her choice.

753
01:00:24,654 --> 01:00:26,986  X1:186 X2:532 Y1:336 Y2:398
If she wants to be with you,
that's fine.

754
01:00:27,056 --> 01:00:29,889  X1:168 X2:550 Y1:375 Y2:405
It's just... there's something I...

755
01:00:31,361 --> 01:00:32,851  X1:238 X2:481 Y1:336 Y2:404
You could tell her
something for me?

756
01:00:32,929 --> 01:00:34,794  X1:165 X2:552 Y1:375 Y2:405
What you want me to tell her?

757
01:00:36,566 --> 01:00:38,056  X1:225 X2:493 Y1:375 Y2:405
Happy Thanksgiving.

758
01:01:03,893 --> 01:01:05,121  X1:305 X2:413 Y1:375 Y2:405
Let's go.

759
01:01:06,562 --> 01:01:07,722  X1:302 X2:416 Y1:375 Y2:399
'Cause...

760
01:01:13,436 --> 01:01:15,870  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:336 Y2:404
Once, there were
people here called "Indians."

761
01:01:15,938 --> 01:01:18,771  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:375 Y2:403
Native Americans, whatever.

762
01:01:18,841 --> 01:01:21,674  X1:213 X2:505 Y1:336 Y2:404
Then a boat came
called the "Mayflower."

763
01:01:21,744 --> 01:01:24,907  X1:178 X2:539 Y1:336 Y2:404
Landed on a big rock
carrying people just like me.

764
01:01:25,915 --> 01:01:29,078  X1:213 X2:505 Y1:336 Y2:398
The first year
on their own was hard.

765
01:01:30,887 --> 01:01:34,345  X1:196 X2:522 Y1:375 Y2:405
It was... really, really hard.

766
01:01:38,161 --> 01:01:39,958  X1:239 X2:479 Y1:375 Y2:405
Let me start again.

767
01:01:44,667 --> 01:01:46,635  X1:229 X2:489 Y1:375 Y2:405
This was long ago...

768
01:01:47,970 --> 01:01:51,565  X1:141 X2:577 Y1:375 Y2:403
before we stole most of their land,

769
01:01:51,641 --> 01:01:56,510  X1:132 X2:585 Y1:336 Y2:398
killed most of them,
and moved the rest to reservations.

770
01:01:56,579 --> 01:01:59,480  X1:164 X2:556 Y1:336 Y2:398
Before they lost their language
and their customs.

771
01:02:05,188 --> 01:02:08,351  X1:177 X2:541 Y1:375 Y2:405
Okay, forget what I just said.

772
01:02:10,059 --> 01:02:12,584  X1:175 X2:543 Y1:375 Y2:405
Once there was this one day

773
01:02:12,662 --> 01:02:17,497  X1:149 X2:567 Y1:336 Y2:404
where everybody seemed
to know they needed each other.

774
01:02:26,476 --> 01:02:28,137  X1:225 X2:492 Y1:375 Y2:405
This one day when...

775
01:02:29,312 --> 01:02:32,304  X1:174 X2:542 Y1:336 Y2:404
they knew for certain
that they couldn't do it alone.

776
01:03:38,548 --> 01:03:40,209  X1:243 X2:475 Y1:375 Y2:405
Why did we stop?

777
01:03:41,717 --> 01:03:43,378  X1:255 X2:464 Y1:375 Y2:405
Daddy thought...

778
01:04:28,898 --> 01:04:31,389  X1:325 X2:395 Y1:375 Y2:399
168...

779
01:04:31,467 --> 01:04:36,700  X1:314 X2:404 Y1:336 Y2:398
- 160...
- 163.

780
01:04:36,772 --> 01:04:38,763  X1:210 X2:508 Y1:375 Y2:405
I think they get... Daddy!

781
01:04:40,543 --> 01:04:41,874  X1:259 X2:459 Y1:375 Y2:403
Dad, watch out!

782
01:04:44,780 --> 01:04:48,716  X1:186 X2:531 Y1:336 Y2:404
- Who are they?
- 154. It should be up here.

783
01:05:09,505 --> 01:05:10,802  X1:276 X2:440 Y1:375 Y2:405
Oh, my God!

784
01:05:10,873 --> 01:05:11,965  X1:308 X2:409 Y1:375 Y2:405
Oh, my.

785
01:05:12,041 --> 01:05:13,941  X1:203 X2:514 Y1:375 Y2:405
This is the wrong street.

786
01:05:14,010 --> 01:05:17,241  X1:210 X2:508 Y1:336 Y2:402
- No, I think we're here.
- No, it can't be.

787
01:05:18,281 --> 01:05:20,181  X1:225 X2:492 Y1:375 Y2:405
We have obviously...

788
01:05:20,249 --> 01:05:22,843  X1:150 X2:566 Y1:336 Y2:404
We've obviously got the wrong...
the wrong address.

789
01:05:22,919 --> 01:05:24,910  X1:215 X2:503 Y1:375 Y2:405
Daddy, I think this is it.

790
01:05:30,726 --> 01:05:32,125  X1:242 X2:476 Y1:375 Y2:405
Goddamn it, April.

791
01:05:38,968 --> 01:05:41,129  X1:241 X2:478 Y1:336 Y2:404
I don't understand.
How did you...?

792
01:05:44,206 --> 01:05:45,366  X1:315 X2:403 Y1:375 Y2:399
What?

793
01:05:47,443 --> 01:05:50,935  X1:237 X2:481 Y1:336 Y2:404
- It's carved dough.
- Carved dough.

794
01:05:59,322 --> 01:06:00,584  X1:288 X2:430 Y1:375 Y2:405
Thank you.

795
01:06:03,192 --> 01:06:04,557  X1:253 X2:465 Y1:375 Y2:405
Lock your doors!

796
01:06:08,297 --> 01:06:10,322  X1:228 X2:492 Y1:336 Y2:404
Hey, welcome!

797
01:06:10,399 --> 01:06:12,230  X1:243 X2:474 Y1:375 Y2:403
Mom, don't! Mom!

798
01:06:12,301 --> 01:06:14,166  X1:293 X2:426 Y1:375 Y2:405
I'm Bobby.

799
01:06:14,236 --> 01:06:16,636  X1:200 X2:518 Y1:375 Y2:405
Aren't you April's family?

800
01:06:19,275 --> 01:06:20,606  X1:289 X2:429 Y1:375 Y2:399
That hurts.

801
01:06:24,013 --> 01:06:25,844  X1:198 X2:519 Y1:375 Y2:399
You must be her mother.

802
01:06:31,587 --> 01:06:34,078  X1:224 X2:495 Y1:336 Y2:404
Well, um...
I'm gonna go get her.

803
01:06:41,897 --> 01:06:45,196  X1:240 X2:475 Y1:375 Y2:405
April, they're here!

804
01:06:45,267 --> 01:06:47,258  X1:169 X2:548 Y1:375 Y2:405
Hey, babe, your family's here!

805
01:06:51,273 --> 01:06:52,433  X1:273 X2:443 Y1:375 Y2:405
They're here!

806
01:06:52,975 --> 01:06:54,135  X1:261 X2:458 Y1:336 Y2:398
- They're here?
- Yeah.

807
01:06:54,210 --> 01:06:56,041  X1:209 X2:509 Y1:336 Y2:404
Oh, my God,
what happened to you?

808
01:06:56,112 --> 01:06:58,137  X1:233 X2:485 Y1:336 Y2:398
- I'm good.
- You need first aid.

809
01:06:58,214 --> 01:06:59,909  X1:273 X2:447 Y1:375 Y2:403
No, no, look...

810
01:06:59,982 --> 01:07:01,643  X1:195 X2:521 Y1:375 Y2:405
your family is downstairs.

811
01:07:01,717 --> 01:07:03,844  X1:165 X2:554 Y1:375 Y2:405
Look at your lips and your eye.

812
01:07:03,919 --> 01:07:06,080  X1:246 X2:472 Y1:375 Y2:405
I'm good. I'm fine.

813
01:07:07,123 --> 01:07:10,251  X1:136 X2:582 Y1:336 Y2:404
They're downstairs waiting for you.
You gotta go.

814
01:07:10,326 --> 01:07:11,816  X1:192 X2:525 Y1:375 Y2:405
Are you sure you're okay?

815
01:07:12,561 --> 01:07:13,721  X1:335 X2:382 Y1:375 Y2:399
Go.

816
01:07:17,366 --> 01:07:19,766  X1:158 X2:560 Y1:336 Y2:404
- The cranberry sauce is ready.
- They're here.

817
01:08:18,694 --> 01:08:21,162  X1:185 X2:533 Y1:336 Y2:404
I don't understand.
They were just down there.

818
01:08:22,031 --> 01:08:23,862  X1:240 X2:478 Y1:336 Y2:398
Maybe they went
and ran an errand.

819
01:08:28,537 --> 01:08:30,266  X1:216 X2:502 Y1:336 Y2:404
Why would they come
all this way?

820
01:09:00,769 --> 01:09:04,205  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:336 Y2:404
Bobby, what are we
gonna do with all the food?

821
01:09:05,808 --> 01:09:07,298  X1:261 X2:457 Y1:375 Y2:399
This is so nice.

822
01:09:13,149 --> 01:09:14,639  X1:203 X2:515 Y1:375 Y2:405
Something smells good.

823
01:09:15,384 --> 01:09:18,376  X1:165 X2:553 Y1:336 Y2:404
I'm sure we'll be able to find
something for everybody here.

824
01:09:21,323 --> 01:09:24,087  X1:165 X2:553 Y1:336 Y2:404
- You okay?
- I need to go to the bathroom.

825
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:26,560  X1:218 X2:499 Y1:336 Y2:404
- I'll... l'll...
- Timmy can take me.

826
01:09:39,041 --> 01:09:43,205  X1:195 X2:524 Y1:336 Y2:404
Don't be hard on yourself.
We did the right thing.

827
01:09:46,415 --> 01:09:48,246  X1:201 X2:518 Y1:375 Y2:405
It's much better this way.

828
01:09:48,317 --> 01:09:50,615  X1:225 X2:493 Y1:336 Y2:404
Good afternoon.
Happy Thanksgiving.

829
01:09:50,686 --> 01:09:51,846  X1:225 X2:493 Y1:375 Y2:405
Happy Thanksgiving.

831
01:09:55,591 --> 01:09:57,923  X1:226 X2:491 Y1:336 Y2:404
That's it! I'm leaving.
You're on your own.

832
01:09:57,993 --> 01:09:59,654  X1:187 X2:532 Y1:375 Y2:405
Let's see how you like that.

833
01:09:59,728 --> 01:10:00,888  X1:322 X2:394 Y1:375 Y2:399
Mom!

837
01:11:05,094 --> 01:11:06,925  X1:203 X2:515 Y1:375 Y2:405
Italian, we've got Ranch.

838
01:11:23,145 --> 01:11:24,544  X1:158 X2:559 Y1:375 Y2:405
They're made on the premises.

839
01:11:24,613 --> 01:11:27,844  X1:121 X2:596 Y1:336 Y2:404
We've got a great Black Forest cake.
We also have great pies.

840
01:11:27,916 --> 01:11:30,316  X1:169 X2:549 Y1:336 Y2:404

841
01:11:30,386 --> 01:11:32,115  X1:177 X2:541 Y1:336 Y2:404
Do you have whipped cream
with the pie?

842
01:11:32,187 --> 01:11:33,176  X1:291 X2:426 Y1:375 Y2:399
Of course.
