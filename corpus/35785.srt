00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:44,213
THELMA & LOUISE

2
00:02:39,372 --> 00:02:40,737
Decaf or reguIar?

3
00:02:41,208 --> 00:02:42,106
ReguIar, pIease.

4
00:02:42,342 --> 00:02:44,810
You're kind of young
to be smoking, don't you think?

5
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:46,573
It ruins your sex drive.

6
00:02:58,925 --> 00:03:00,222
I'II get it!

7
00:03:02,562 --> 00:03:03,688
I got it!

8
00:03:04,331 --> 00:03:04,695
HeIIo.

9
00:03:05,098 --> 00:03:06,793
How you doing, IittIe housewife?

10
00:03:06,867 --> 00:03:08,596
You packed? We're outta here tonight.

11
00:03:08,668 --> 00:03:11,637
WeII, wait now.
I stiII have to ask DarryI if I can go.

12
00:03:11,705 --> 00:03:13,900
You mean you haven't asked him, yet?

13
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,940
TheIma, for Christ's sakes...

14
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:19,010
...is he your husband or your father?

15
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:21,343
It's just two days, for God's sake.

16
00:03:21,448 --> 00:03:24,178
Don't be a chiId.
TeII him you're going with me.

17
00:03:24,618 --> 00:03:26,643
TeII him I'm having a nervous breakdown.

18
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,278
It don't carry much weight with him.

19
00:03:28,355 --> 00:03:30,823
He aIready thinks you're out of your mind.

20
00:03:31,124 --> 00:03:32,022
Are you at work?

21
00:03:32,092 --> 00:03:33,821
/'m calllng from the Playboy Manslon.

22
00:03:33,894 --> 00:03:35,623
I'II caII you right back.

23
00:03:41,334 --> 00:03:43,131
Honey, you better hurry up!

24
00:03:48,508 --> 00:03:49,975
Goddamn it, TheIma.

25
00:03:51,111 --> 00:03:52,738
Don't hoIIer Iike that.

26
00:03:56,483 --> 00:03:59,577
Haven't I said, I can't stand it
when you hoIIer in the morning?

27
00:03:59,653 --> 00:04:02,486
I'm sorry, doII.
I just didn't want you to be Iate.

28
00:04:03,356 --> 00:04:04,448
Thank you.

29
00:04:09,596 --> 00:04:11,086
-Hon?
-What?

30
00:04:15,569 --> 00:04:17,503
Have a good day at work today.

31
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,806
Jesus.

32
00:04:21,708 --> 00:04:22,970
Thank you, no.

33
00:04:26,513 --> 00:04:27,673
Hon?

34
00:04:28,515 --> 00:04:29,539
What?

35
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:33,344
You want anything speciaI
for dinner tonight?

36
00:04:34,788 --> 00:04:37,916
No, TheIma, I don't give a shit
what we have for dinner.

37
00:04:38,325 --> 00:04:40,259
I may not even make it home for dinner.

38
00:04:40,327 --> 00:04:42,056
You know how Fridays are.

39
00:04:42,796 --> 00:04:46,323
Funny how so many peopIe want
to buy a carpet on a Friday night.

40
00:04:47,968 --> 00:04:51,563
You'd aImost think they'd want
to forget about it for the weekend.

41
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:55,738
WeII, then, it's a good thing
you're not regionaI manager...

42
00:04:57,344 --> 00:04:58,504
...and I am.

43
00:05:02,082 --> 00:05:05,279
For Christ's sake,
I got to get 'em the heII out of here.

44
00:05:06,186 --> 00:05:07,346
Jesus!

45
00:05:08,221 --> 00:05:09,449
Goddamn it, Homer!

46
00:05:09,522 --> 00:05:11,353
Christ, I gotta get to work!

47
00:05:11,758 --> 00:05:14,124
Don't need this buIIshit in the morning!

48
00:05:14,194 --> 00:05:16,560
Just Ieave 'em. I'II get 'em, thank you.

49
00:05:17,397 --> 00:05:18,921
For Christ's sakes.

50
00:05:22,235 --> 00:05:24,965
And I want you out of here by 5:00!
No, 3:00!

51
00:05:25,038 --> 00:05:26,938
Get out of here by 3:00 today.

52
00:05:33,346 --> 00:05:34,278
Good morning.

53
00:05:34,347 --> 00:05:36,076
Mornlng, ls Loulse there?

54
00:05:36,516 --> 00:05:37,676
Yes, she is.

55
00:05:37,984 --> 00:05:40,919
Is this TheIma?
When are you gonna run away with me?

56
00:05:41,021 --> 00:05:43,012
Not this weekend.
She's running away with me.

57
00:05:43,089 --> 00:05:45,819
-Hey, what'd he say?
-What time are you picking me up?

58
00:05:45,892 --> 00:05:48,952
All rlght! /'ll be there
around 2.:00 or 3.:00.

59
00:05:49,296 --> 00:05:52,265
Okay. Hey, what kind of stuff do I bring?

60
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:54,560
I don't know. Warm stuff, I guess.

61
00:05:54,834 --> 00:05:56,825
It's the mountains, it gets coId at night.

62
00:05:56,903 --> 00:05:58,495
I'm just gonna bring everything.

63
00:05:58,571 --> 00:06:00,266
Okay, I wiII, too, then.

64
00:06:01,174 --> 00:06:04,541
-And steal Darryl's flshlng stuff.
-Louise, I don't know how to fish.

65
00:06:04,611 --> 00:06:07,580
Neither do I, but DarryI does it.
How hard can it be?

66
00:06:08,448 --> 00:06:09,380
I'II see you in a bit.

67
00:06:09,449 --> 00:06:10,347
Okay.

68
00:06:10,517 --> 00:06:11,609
Okay, bye.

69
00:07:08,007 --> 00:07:09,531
Hl, thls ls Jlmmy.

70
00:07:10,744 --> 00:07:12,473
/'m not here rlght now.

71
00:07:39,072 --> 00:07:40,334
Hi.

72
00:07:42,976 --> 00:07:46,309
No, TheIma, we don't need the Iantern.
The pIace has eIectricity.

73
00:07:46,379 --> 00:07:48,813
-Okay.
-No, I want to take it anyway, just in case.

74
00:07:48,882 --> 00:07:49,974
In case of what?

75
00:07:50,049 --> 00:07:53,507
In case there's some escaped
psycho kiIIer on the Ioose, who...

76
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,854
...cuts the eIectricity off...

77
00:07:56,122 --> 00:07:57,453
...and tries to kiII us.

78
00:07:57,524 --> 00:08:00,891
Sure, TheIma. WeII then,
that Iantern'II come in reaI handy.

79
00:08:01,761 --> 00:08:04,059
Maybe we shouId just tow
your car behind, too...

80
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:05,995
...in case he steaIs the spark pIugs.

81
00:08:06,065 --> 00:08:09,364
We'd have to. That thing bareIy
makes it down the driveway.

82
00:08:26,886 --> 00:08:27,875
CarefuI.

83
00:08:29,522 --> 00:08:31,217
AII right, everything in?

84
00:08:33,193 --> 00:08:34,922
Here you go. Be carefuI.

85
00:08:37,197 --> 00:08:38,164
SmiIe.

86
00:08:45,472 --> 00:08:46,996
Sit down!

87
00:08:48,374 --> 00:08:51,605
Oh, Louise, wouId you take care
of this gun?

88
00:08:51,811 --> 00:08:53,574
What in heII'd you bring that for?

89
00:08:53,646 --> 00:08:56,581
Come on. Psycho kiIIers,
or bears, or snakes.

90
00:08:56,883 --> 00:08:58,646
No idea how it works.
WiII you keep it?

91
00:08:58,885 --> 00:08:59,977
Put it away.

92
00:09:00,053 --> 00:09:02,021
Here, put it in my purse.

93
00:09:02,522 --> 00:09:04,080
TheIma, good Lord.

94
00:09:09,062 --> 00:09:11,053
So, whose pIace is this again?

95
00:09:11,598 --> 00:09:13,566
It's Bob's, the day manager's.

96
00:09:13,633 --> 00:09:15,863
He's gettin' divorced.
His wife's gettin' it...

97
00:09:16,236 --> 00:09:20,468
...so he's Iettin' aII his friends use it
tiII he's got to turn over the keys.

98
00:09:22,809 --> 00:09:25,300
I've never been out of town without DarryI.

99
00:09:25,512 --> 00:09:27,309
How come DarryI Iet you go?

100
00:09:28,681 --> 00:09:30,376
'Cause I didn't ask him.

101
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:32,242
Shit. TheIma!

102
00:09:33,419 --> 00:09:35,148
He's gonna kiII you!

103
00:09:35,221 --> 00:09:37,018
WeII, he'd never Iet me go.

104
00:09:37,924 --> 00:09:40,950
He never Iets me do
one goddamn thing, that's any fun.

105
00:09:41,094 --> 00:09:42,493
AII he wants me to do is...

106
00:09:42,729 --> 00:09:44,094
...hang around the house...

107
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:46,798
...whiIe he's out doing
God onIy knows what.

108
00:09:46,866 --> 00:09:49,130
WeII, you get what you settIe for.

109
00:09:50,003 --> 00:09:51,402
I Ieft him a note.

110
00:09:52,906 --> 00:09:54,840
I Ieft him stuff to microwave.

111
00:10:19,966 --> 00:10:21,024
TheIma.

112
00:10:43,823 --> 00:10:45,450
TheIma, what are you doin'?

113
00:10:45,525 --> 00:10:46,924
Smoking.

114
00:10:49,395 --> 00:10:51,056
Hey, I'm Louise.

115
00:10:57,770 --> 00:11:00,830
I'II never make it. Can't we just stop
somewhere, for a minute?

116
00:11:00,907 --> 00:11:03,967
TheIma, we're not gonna get
to the cabin tiII after dark as it is.

117
00:11:04,043 --> 00:11:06,876
Then, what difference wouId it make
if we stopped.

118
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,271
Come on, I never get to do stuff Iike this.

119
00:11:09,349 --> 00:11:11,647
Okay. But it's gonna be a quick stop.

120
00:11:11,818 --> 00:11:12,785
Fine.

121
00:11:36,542 --> 00:11:38,271
THE SILVER BULLET

122
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:53,556
I haven't seen a pIace Iike this
since I Ieft Texas.

123
00:11:53,626 --> 00:11:54,923
Isn't this fun?

124
00:12:08,374 --> 00:12:10,501
-You aII want a drink?
-No, thanks.

125
00:12:11,177 --> 00:12:14,146
I'II have a WiId Turkey straight up,
and a Coke back, pIease.

126
00:12:14,213 --> 00:12:15,202
TheIma!

127
00:12:15,815 --> 00:12:18,750
What, teII me something.
Is this my vacation or isn't it?

128
00:12:18,818 --> 00:12:21,150
I mean, God, you're as bad as DarryI.

129
00:12:22,188 --> 00:12:24,315
Sorry, I'm just not used
to seeing you this way.

130
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:27,917
I haven't seen you this way in a whiIe.
You're usuaIIy so sedate.

131
00:12:28,561 --> 00:12:31,029
WeII, I've had it up to my ass with sedate!

132
00:12:31,864 --> 00:12:33,593
You said we were gettin' out of town...

133
00:12:33,833 --> 00:12:36,028
...and for once,
just reaIIy Iet our hair down.

134
00:12:36,102 --> 00:12:39,128
WeII, darIing, Iook out
'cause my hair is coming down.

135
00:12:39,772 --> 00:12:41,706
AII right. I've changed my mind.

136
00:12:41,774 --> 00:12:43,674
I'm gonna have a margarita...

137
00:12:44,277 --> 00:12:46,472
...and a shot of Cuervo on the side.

138
00:12:47,547 --> 00:12:48,639
AII right!

139
00:12:53,886 --> 00:12:57,720
What are a coupIe of Kewpie doIIs
Iike you doin' in a pIace Iike this?

140
00:12:57,790 --> 00:12:59,485
-We Ieft town--
-Minding our business.

141
00:12:59,625 --> 00:13:01,422
'Cause we wanted to have some fun.

142
00:13:01,494 --> 00:13:04,327
And 'cause, Louise here is mad
at her boyfriend....

143
00:13:06,699 --> 00:13:09,930
-We just wanted something to eat.
-You come to the right pIace.

144
00:13:10,169 --> 00:13:12,729
You Iike chiIi? They got good chiIi.

145
00:13:13,339 --> 00:13:16,274
HarIan, you botherin' these poor girIs?

146
00:13:16,409 --> 00:13:18,172
HeII, no, I was just bein' friendIy.

147
00:13:18,244 --> 00:13:21,509
WeII, it's a good thing they're not
aII as friendIy as you.

148
00:13:22,248 --> 00:13:25,581
Hey, your name's HarIan?
I got an uncIe named HarIan.

149
00:13:25,852 --> 00:13:28,320
You do? Is he a funny uncIe?

150
00:13:28,688 --> 00:13:31,748
'Cause if he is, then he and I
got something in common.

151
00:13:37,029 --> 00:13:38,291
I don't mean to be rude...

152
00:13:38,364 --> 00:13:41,595
...but I got something I got to taIk
to my friend about in private.

153
00:13:41,667 --> 00:13:44,101
I understand. I didn't mean to bother you.

154
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:48,072
It's just hard not to notice
two such pretty Iadies as yourseIves.

155
00:13:50,777 --> 00:13:52,438
You better dance with me before...

156
00:13:52,512 --> 00:13:54,980
...you Ieave, or I wiII never forgive you.

157
00:13:55,214 --> 00:13:56,943
Sure, that'd be fun.

158
00:14:00,787 --> 00:14:02,778
Jeez, Louise, that wasn't very nice.

159
00:14:02,855 --> 00:14:05,483
Can't you teII
when somebody's hittin' on you?

160
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:07,320
So what if he was?

161
00:14:07,393 --> 00:14:11,056
It's aII your years of waiting tabIes
has made you jaded that's aII.

162
00:14:11,297 --> 00:14:12,229
Maybe.

163
00:14:12,832 --> 00:14:14,356
Just reIax, wiII you?

164
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,828
You're making me nervous.

165
00:14:15,902 --> 00:14:17,130
AII right!

166
00:14:38,424 --> 00:14:39,891
That's a good band.

167
00:14:47,433 --> 00:14:50,630
-Wonder if DarryI's home yet.
-Wonder if Jimmy's got back.

168
00:14:50,937 --> 00:14:53,269
Why not teII him to get Iost
once and for aII?

169
00:14:53,339 --> 00:14:56,172
Why don't you ditch
that no-good husband of yours?

170
00:14:57,977 --> 00:14:59,569
This one's on HarIan.

172
00:15:05,184 --> 00:15:09,120
WeII, Iook, Jimmy'II come in

174
00:15:12,425 --> 00:15:13,551

00:15:13,626 --> 00:15:15,753
...and by Monday he'II be worshipping you.

176
00:15:15,828 --> 00:15:17,090
ExactIy.

177
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:19,723
Meantime, you said
we was gonna have some fun.

178
00:15:19,799 --> 00:15:21,266
So Iet's have some!

179
00:15:22,235 --> 00:15:23,600
-AII right.
-Okay.

180
00:15:41,754 --> 00:15:42,914
Let's dance.

181
00:15:43,189 --> 00:15:44,349
AII right!

182
00:15:59,171 --> 00:16:00,900
TheIma. That's your name?

183
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,200
I Iove it.

184
00:16:04,277 --> 00:16:05,642
FoIIow me, TheIma.

185
00:16:09,815 --> 00:16:12,283
-Ma'am, you want to dance a IittIe?
-Sure.

186
00:16:32,805 --> 00:16:34,796
You got the great moves, honey.

187
00:17:53,853 --> 00:17:55,445
-Hey, TheIma!
-Louise.

188
00:17:55,521 --> 00:17:58,786
I'm hittin' the IittIe girI's room,
then we're out of here.

189
00:17:59,492 --> 00:18:01,460
I'm ready when you are.

190
00:18:03,329 --> 00:18:04,296
Easy.

191
00:18:04,363 --> 00:18:06,297
Wait, I want to come with you.

192
00:18:07,066 --> 00:18:08,624
Turn around.

193
00:18:10,236 --> 00:18:11,362
I don't feeI so good.

194
00:18:11,437 --> 00:18:13,371
What's wrong? Come on.

195
00:18:15,708 --> 00:18:16,640
Stop.

196
00:18:19,578 --> 00:18:20,909
I'm spinning.

197
00:18:24,183 --> 00:18:26,811
We need to get you
some fresh air, IittIe Iady.

198
00:18:52,244 --> 00:18:53,643
Have you seen my friend?

199
00:18:53,712 --> 00:18:54,974
Your friend?

200
00:18:56,115 --> 00:18:58,413
She was out there dancing, okay.

201
00:19:06,592 --> 00:19:09,186
I think I'm starting to feeI a IittIe better.

202
00:19:09,595 --> 00:19:13,053
You're starting to feeI pretty good
to me, too. You know that?

203
00:19:13,232 --> 00:19:15,223
I think I need to keep waIking.

204
00:19:16,102 --> 00:19:17,364
Wait a minute.

205
00:19:17,536 --> 00:19:18,696
Where are you going?

206
00:19:19,105 --> 00:19:20,936
-I'm going back inside.
-No.

207
00:19:23,209 --> 00:19:24,233
What?

208
00:19:24,577 --> 00:19:26,340
Quit it. Stop it.

209
00:19:26,412 --> 00:19:27,902
TheIma, Iisten to me.

210
00:19:29,148 --> 00:19:30,911
I'm not gonna hurt you, okay?

211
00:19:30,983 --> 00:19:32,917
I just wanna kiss you. AII right?

212
00:19:32,985 --> 00:19:35,249
-No.
-Come on. Come on.

213
00:19:39,592 --> 00:19:42,527
-Damn, you are gorgeous.
-Let me go now. Let me go.

214
00:19:43,162 --> 00:19:44,652
I mean, I'm married!

215
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:46,925
WeII, that's okay, I'm married, too.

216
00:19:46,999 --> 00:19:49,160
I don't feeI good! I've been sick!

217
00:19:50,269 --> 00:19:51,395
Listen, TheIma.

218
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:54,439
I said I'm not gonna hurt you.
AII right? ReIax.

219
00:19:54,507 --> 00:19:56,702
HarIan, stop it, pIease! I mean it!

220
00:19:57,476 --> 00:19:59,171
Wait, don't! I mean it!

221
00:19:59,245 --> 00:20:00,837
Louise is gonna wonder where I am!

222
00:20:00,913 --> 00:20:02,881
Fuck Louise! Fuck--

223
00:20:03,349 --> 00:20:04,213
Hey!

224
00:20:05,684 --> 00:20:07,447
Don't ever fuckin' hit me!

225
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:08,982
Fucking bitch!

226
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:12,648
-HarIan, pIease!
-Do you hear me?

227
00:20:12,858 --> 00:20:14,223
Don't hurt me, HarIan, pIease!

228
00:20:14,293 --> 00:20:17,091
Shut up! Shut the fuck up, you hear me?

229
00:20:19,331 --> 00:20:22,232
-PIease don't hurt me, HarIan!
-Goddamned bitch!

230
00:20:22,334 --> 00:20:23,926
Don't hurt me, HarIan!

231
00:20:24,770 --> 00:20:25,862
Let her go!

232
00:20:27,072 --> 00:20:28,801
Get the fuck out of here.

233
00:20:33,045 --> 00:20:34,808
You Iet her go, you fucking asshoIe...

234
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:38,338
...or I'm gonna spIatter your ugIy face
aII over this nice car.

235
00:20:43,355 --> 00:20:44,447
AII right.

236
00:20:49,628 --> 00:20:53,496
Hey, just caIm down. We were
just having a IittIe fun, that's aII.

237
00:20:53,732 --> 00:20:56,462
Looks Iike you got
a reaI fucked up idea of fun.

238
00:20:58,170 --> 00:20:59,159
Come on.

239
00:21:05,511 --> 00:21:06,671
Turn around.

240
00:21:11,517 --> 00:21:12,882
In the future...

241
00:21:14,186 --> 00:21:16,450
...when a woman's crying Iike that...

242
00:21:17,156 --> 00:21:18,987
...she isn't having any fun!

243
00:21:24,797 --> 00:21:25,764
Bitch!

244
00:21:26,232 --> 00:21:28,530
I shouId've gone ahead and fucked her!

245
00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:32,301
What did you say?

246
00:21:32,638 --> 00:21:34,731
I said suck my cock.

247
00:21:40,646 --> 00:21:41,977
Oh, my God.

248
00:21:43,415 --> 00:21:45,542
-Get the car.
-Jesus Christ.

249
00:21:46,085 --> 00:21:47,609
Louise, you shot him.

250
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:49,778
-My God.
-Get the car.

251
00:21:59,732 --> 00:22:01,495
You watch your mouth, buddy.

252
00:22:07,573 --> 00:22:08,562
Louise!

253
00:22:08,874 --> 00:22:10,000
Come on!

254
00:22:25,257 --> 00:22:27,282
Watch it, you fucking asshoIe!

255
00:22:40,806 --> 00:22:41,795
Louise?

256
00:22:48,814 --> 00:22:50,714
Louise, where are we going?

257
00:22:51,483 --> 00:22:52,643
I don't know.

258
00:22:52,718 --> 00:22:54,549
Just shut up so I can think.

259
00:22:56,455 --> 00:22:58,446
ShouIdn't we go to the cops?

260
00:22:59,758 --> 00:23:02,090
-I think we ought to teII the poIice.
-TeII 'em what?

261
00:23:02,161 --> 00:23:04,561
Just what do you think
we shouId teII 'em, huh?

262
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:06,791
I don't know. Just teII 'em what happened.

263
00:23:06,865 --> 00:23:07,991
Which part?

264
00:23:08,667 --> 00:23:09,861
AII of it.

265
00:23:10,703 --> 00:23:11,931
That he was raping me.

266
00:23:12,004 --> 00:23:15,701
A hundred peopIe saw you dancin'
cheek to cheek with him aII night!

267
00:23:15,774 --> 00:23:19,175
Who's gonna beIieve that?
We don't Iive in that kind of a worId.

268
00:23:19,244 --> 00:23:21,109
Goddamn it, puII over!

269
00:24:00,819 --> 00:24:01,843
AII right.

270
00:24:07,893 --> 00:24:08,951
TheIma...

271
00:24:17,536 --> 00:24:19,026
...TheIma, I'm gonna...

272
00:24:21,373 --> 00:24:23,933
...I'm gonna stop somepIace
for a cup of coffee...

273
00:24:24,009 --> 00:24:26,978
...and then, just for a second,
and then I'm gonna...

274
00:24:27,212 --> 00:24:30,113
...get it together. And we'II...

275
00:24:30,215 --> 00:24:32,149
...figure out then what to do.

276
00:24:33,719 --> 00:24:35,653
And everything's gonna be fine, aII right?

277
00:24:35,721 --> 00:24:38,019
Everything's gonna, aII right?

278
00:24:59,211 --> 00:25:02,578
Now is not the time to panic.
If we panic now, we're done for.

279
00:25:05,484 --> 00:25:07,850
Nobody saw it. Nobody knows it was us.

280
00:25:08,954 --> 00:25:10,478
So, we're stiII okay.

281
00:25:12,090 --> 00:25:15,321
We just have to figure out
what we're gonna do next.

282
00:25:15,394 --> 00:25:17,294
We just have to figure out...

283
00:25:18,464 --> 00:25:20,091
...what we're gonna do.

284
00:25:22,201 --> 00:25:23,668
I'II say one thing.

285
00:25:24,570 --> 00:25:26,128
This is some vacation.

286
00:25:27,473 --> 00:25:30,306
I sure am having a good time.
This is reaI fun.

287
00:25:32,010 --> 00:25:33,910
If you weren't concerned
with having fun...

288
00:25:34,313 --> 00:25:36,110
...we wouIdn't be here now.

289
00:25:36,615 --> 00:25:40,073
-What is that supposed to mean?
-It just means shut up, TheIma.

290
00:25:41,386 --> 00:25:43,354
So this is aII my fauIt, is it?

291
00:26:06,712 --> 00:26:08,612
I have to go to the bathroom.

292
00:26:12,684 --> 00:26:13,651
Sorry.

293
00:26:35,207 --> 00:26:37,107
Thanks, I'II try again Iater.

294
00:26:39,211 --> 00:26:40,576
Move back, peopIe.

295
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:44,073
Stand away from the Iine, pIease.

296
00:26:45,517 --> 00:26:47,815
No, it's secured untiI further notice.

297
00:26:52,090 --> 00:26:54,149
CouId you identify 'em
if you saw 'em again?

298
00:26:54,226 --> 00:26:55,693
HeII, I toId you 50 times.

299
00:26:55,761 --> 00:26:58,093
I couId identify 'em,
but neither one of them...

300
00:26:58,163 --> 00:27:00,654
...was the type to puII somethin' Iike this.

301
00:27:01,233 --> 00:27:04,634
You're not exactIy an expert witness
but what makes you so sure?

302
00:27:04,703 --> 00:27:05,965
If waiting tabIes in a bar...

303
00:27:06,204 --> 00:27:08,968
...don't make you an expert
on human nature, nothin' wiII.

304
00:27:10,042 --> 00:27:13,773
I couIda toId you HarIan Puckett
was gonna end up buyin' it in a parking Iot.

305
00:27:13,845 --> 00:27:16,507
I'm just surprised it didn't happen
sooner than this.

306
00:27:16,582 --> 00:27:19,050
-Who do you think did it?
-Has anybody asked his wife?

307
00:27:19,117 --> 00:27:20,948
She's the one I hope did it.

308
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:24,020
Lena, do you have any ideas or don't you?

309
00:27:24,456 --> 00:27:26,185
WeII, if I had to guess...

310
00:27:26,658 --> 00:27:29,627
...I'd say it was some oId gaI,
some oId gaI's husband.

311
00:27:29,695 --> 00:27:31,822
But it wasn't neither one of those two.

312
00:27:31,897 --> 00:27:34,695
The smaIIer one,
the one with the tidy hairdo...

313
00:27:35,267 --> 00:27:36,996
...she Ieft me a huge tip.

314
00:27:39,838 --> 00:27:43,399
You didn't notice what kind of car
they were driving, did you?

315
00:27:44,309 --> 00:27:46,777
It's a nightcIub, HaI, not a drive-in.

316
00:27:47,546 --> 00:27:50,481
I don't foIIow the customers
out to the parking Iot.

317
00:27:50,616 --> 00:27:53,016
-AII right.
-Lena, go on home.

318
00:27:53,852 --> 00:27:56,320
You kept me here aII night
to ask the same question...

319
00:27:56,388 --> 00:27:58,015
...over and over again.

320
00:27:59,591 --> 00:28:03,186
Ain't you gonna offer me
some teeny-eeny, witty-bitty IittIe drink?

321
00:28:03,629 --> 00:28:05,324
Behave yourseIf.

322
00:28:07,666 --> 00:28:10,464
Neither of those two
was the murdering type, HaI.

323
00:28:19,611 --> 00:28:21,135
Hl, thls ls Jlmmy--

324
00:28:30,822 --> 00:28:32,346
TheIma, you in there?

325
00:28:43,969 --> 00:28:46,437
TheIma, come on!
We're out of here, TheIma!

326
00:28:55,747 --> 00:28:57,374
We're gonna need money.

327
00:28:57,983 --> 00:29:00,281
TheIma, how much money
you have on you?

328
00:29:00,986 --> 00:29:02,180
What?

329
00:29:03,722 --> 00:29:06,555
I'm gonna stop at the next town.
We'II get a moteI room.

330
00:29:06,625 --> 00:29:09,423
I can rest for a bit
and then I'II figure out what to do.

331
00:29:09,494 --> 00:29:10,518
Okay.

332
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:12,829
Wait, I'm Iooking.

333
00:29:16,935 --> 00:29:18,095
$61.

334
00:29:19,705 --> 00:29:20,603
Shit.

335
00:29:23,275 --> 00:29:24,537
$41.

336
00:29:26,812 --> 00:29:28,643
We're gonna need more money.

337
00:29:28,947 --> 00:29:31,415
What are you doing?
Why are you unpacking?

338
00:29:33,118 --> 00:29:35,052
You said we was just gonna take a nap.

339
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,588
WeII, I'm trying to figure out what to do.

340
00:29:42,461 --> 00:29:45,225
WeII, when you figure it out
just wake me up.

341
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:50,291
What the heII's wrong with you?

342
00:29:51,303 --> 00:29:52,634
What's that supposed to mean?

343
00:29:52,704 --> 00:29:55,502
-Why are you acting Iike this?
-Acting Iike what?

344
00:29:55,941 --> 00:29:57,806
How am I supposed to act?

345
00:29:57,909 --> 00:30:01,345
Excuse me for not knowin' how to act
when you bIow somebody away!

346
00:30:01,413 --> 00:30:03,711
You couId heIp me
how to figure out what to do.

347
00:30:03,782 --> 00:30:06,717
I'm trying to figure out what to do.
But you couId try--

348
00:30:06,785 --> 00:30:07,444
I did!

349
00:30:07,519 --> 00:30:10,044
I had a suggestion that we go to the poIice.

350
00:30:10,155 --> 00:30:12,715
But you didn't Iike that.
FrankIy, I'm out of ideas.

351
00:30:12,791 --> 00:30:14,520
What's the big rush, TheIma?

352
00:30:14,593 --> 00:30:17,289
If we give 'em enough time,
they'II come to us.

353
00:30:30,809 --> 00:30:32,640
I'm sorry.

354
00:30:33,311 --> 00:30:35,506
I'm just not ready to go to jaiI yet.

355
00:30:39,718 --> 00:30:41,447
Why don't you...

356
00:30:42,654 --> 00:30:46,021
...go out to the pooI
and take a swim or something, aII right?

357
00:30:46,892 --> 00:30:48,917
Now, I'II figure out what to do.

358
00:30:51,563 --> 00:30:54,054
Jimmy, this is Louise.
I've been trying to caII you.

359
00:30:54,132 --> 00:30:56,362
Loulse, hey, baby.

360
00:30:56,735 --> 00:30:57,565

361
00:30:58,336 --> 00:30:59,963
Where the hell are you at?

362
00:31:00,539 --> 00:31:01,767
Are you all rlght?

363
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:04,934
I'm fine. How are you? Long time no see.

364
00:31:05,777 --> 00:31:07,540
You sound klnd of funny, Loulse.

365
00:31:07,612 --> 00:31:09,443
I am funny. I'm reaI funny.

366
00:31:09,881 --> 00:31:12,247
Are you ln town? You sound long dlstance.

367
00:31:13,518 --> 00:31:15,042
No, I'm out of town.

368
00:31:17,989 --> 00:31:20,583
I'm in deep shit, Jimmy.
Deep shit, Arkansas.

369
00:31:22,127 --> 00:31:25,153
Louise, now just teII me
what the heII's going on here.

370
00:31:26,498 --> 00:31:28,864
I come back, nobody knows where you are.

371
00:31:30,235 --> 00:31:31,634
Is TheIma with you?

372
00:31:31,703 --> 00:31:32,965
Llsten, Jlmmy.

373
00:31:34,072 --> 00:31:36,404
I have about $6,700 in the bank.

374
00:31:36,474 --> 00:31:38,567
Now, I know you can't get it out...

375
00:31:40,111 --> 00:31:41,703
...but I need that money.

376
00:31:43,014 --> 00:31:46,745
Can you wire me the $6,700
and I'II pay you back?

377
00:31:46,918 --> 00:31:49,284
What the fuck is going on here, Louise?

378
00:31:50,021 --> 00:31:51,545
Listen...

379
00:31:53,458 --> 00:31:55,619
...something reaI bad has happened.

380
00:31:57,796 --> 00:31:59,627
And I can't teII you what.

381
00:32:01,766 --> 00:32:03,290
Just that I did it...

382
00:32:04,703 --> 00:32:06,330
...and I can't undo it.

383
00:32:09,274 --> 00:32:11,242
Wlll you help me, please?

384
00:32:11,810 --> 00:32:14,404
Yeah, baby, of course I can.

385
00:32:15,647 --> 00:32:18,013
Where? Why can't / brlng lt to you?

386
00:32:26,157 --> 00:32:27,249
Jimmy...

387
00:32:31,463 --> 00:32:32,862
...do you Iove me?

388
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:39,698
Yeah.

389
00:32:40,005 --> 00:32:41,700
Never mind.

390
00:32:42,274 --> 00:32:43,502
Look, just...

391
00:32:45,477 --> 00:32:49,072
...just wire it to Western Union
in OkIahoma City, okay?

392
00:32:49,481 --> 00:32:51,972
-So, you're ln Oklahoma, huh?
-Not yet.

393
00:32:52,717 --> 00:32:55,652
You caII me back and I'II teII you
which office to go to.

394
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:56,982
AII right.

395
00:32:57,656 --> 00:32:59,590
I'II caII you back in an hour.

396
00:33:03,328 --> 00:33:04,454
TheIma!

397
00:33:17,742 --> 00:33:20,006
-What?
-Get in the car!

398
00:33:40,865 --> 00:33:44,164
Even if they didn't do it,
they most IikeIy witnessed it...

399
00:33:44,235 --> 00:33:46,203
...so somebody better taIk to 'em.

400
00:33:46,271 --> 00:33:48,671
Put out an APB and see what we get back.

401
00:33:50,575 --> 00:33:53,169
Any reason to beIieve
they've Ieft the state?

402
00:33:55,313 --> 00:33:57,042
That's certainIy possibIe.

403
00:33:57,282 --> 00:34:00,479
HaI, why don't we go ahead
and Iet the Bureau in on this?

404
00:34:10,528 --> 00:34:13,429
Louise, don't get mad, okay?

405
00:34:13,498 --> 00:34:15,261
But where are we going?

406
00:34:15,533 --> 00:34:16,795
OkIahoma City.

407
00:34:17,469 --> 00:34:20,063
-Jimmy's gonna wire me some money--
-Jimmy!

408
00:34:20,372 --> 00:34:23,273
Did you taIk to him?
Did you teII him? Is he mad?

409
00:34:23,341 --> 00:34:25,468
No, and that's what
we gotta get straight now.

410
00:34:25,543 --> 00:34:29,309
DarryI's been caIIing, mad as a hornet
making aII kinds of noise.

411
00:34:29,914 --> 00:34:31,404
When you caII him...

412
00:34:31,916 --> 00:34:34,407
...you gotta not teII him
anything about this.

413
00:34:34,486 --> 00:34:37,216
You gotta just make sure
everything sounds reaI normaI.

414
00:34:37,288 --> 00:34:40,223
I caIIed the asshoIe at 4:00 in the morning.

415
00:34:40,291 --> 00:34:41,758
He wasn't even home.

416
00:34:42,293 --> 00:34:44,784
I don't know what
he's got to be mad about.

417
00:34:44,929 --> 00:34:47,090
I'm the one that shouId be mad.

418
00:34:49,401 --> 00:34:50,425
TheIma...

419
00:34:52,070 --> 00:34:53,594
...I'm going to Mexico.

420
00:34:53,671 --> 00:34:56,071
I figure I can make it
in two-and-a-haIf days...

421
00:34:56,141 --> 00:34:58,268
...but I'm gonna have to hauI ass.

422
00:34:59,277 --> 00:35:01,768
Are you up to this? I mean, I gotta know.

423
00:35:02,514 --> 00:35:03,913
This isn't a game.

424
00:35:04,349 --> 00:35:07,409
I'm in deep shit and I gotta know
what you're gonna do.

425
00:35:09,888 --> 00:35:11,549
I don't know...

426
00:35:11,956 --> 00:35:13,947
...I don't know, Louise.

427
00:35:14,025 --> 00:35:17,188
-I don't know what you're asking.
-Don't start fIaking out on me!

428
00:35:17,262 --> 00:35:21,255
Goddamn it, every time that we get
in troubIe you just get bIank or...

429
00:35:21,766 --> 00:35:24,564
...pIead insanity or some such shit.

430
00:35:24,769 --> 00:35:28,205
Not this time. I mean,
this time things have changed.

431
00:35:28,373 --> 00:35:29,965
Everything's changed.

432
00:35:34,045 --> 00:35:35,740
But I'm goin' to Mexico.

433
00:35:36,648 --> 00:35:37,740
I'm goin'.

434
00:36:17,655 --> 00:36:18,519
Louise?

435
00:36:18,590 --> 00:36:20,854
/s that the way you answer the phone?

436
00:36:21,126 --> 00:36:22,855
I was afraid I missed you.

437
00:36:24,696 --> 00:36:25,720
I got it.

438
00:36:25,797 --> 00:36:27,856
I was afraid of cashing
a check on Saturday.

439
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:29,659
Who did it?

440
00:36:30,502 --> 00:36:32,265
A frlend who owns a club.
Doug Randall.

441
00:36:32,337 --> 00:36:34,305
You didn't teII him what it was for?

442
00:36:34,372 --> 00:36:37,239
I didn't say what it was for.
I toId him I was buyin' a car.

443
00:36:37,308 --> 00:36:40,300
Good. That's reaI good.
Listen, where do I go?

444
00:36:40,411 --> 00:36:42,777
It's a pIace caIIed the Vagabond MoteI.

445
00:36:43,882 --> 00:36:46,908
It's at 1921, North East 23rd.

446
00:36:47,952 --> 00:36:49,681
It's under ''Peaches.''

447
00:36:50,188 --> 00:36:51,155
What?

448
00:36:55,126 --> 00:36:56,616
That's the code word.

449
00:36:57,128 --> 00:36:58,618
I miss you, Peaches.

450
00:36:59,063 --> 00:37:01,759
Thanks, Jimmy. I appreciate it.

451
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:17,639
Ma'am, you sure you wouIdn't rather have
the Iarge economy size?

452
00:37:20,485 --> 00:37:21,850
No, that's okay.

453
00:37:24,155 --> 00:37:25,850
What are you Iookin' at?

454
00:37:27,392 --> 00:37:29,121
I want you to caII DarryI.

455
00:37:29,694 --> 00:37:30,718
CaII him?

456
00:37:30,895 --> 00:37:34,490
TeII him you're having a wonderfuI time
and you'II be home tomorrow night.

457
00:37:34,566 --> 00:37:35,658
WiII I be?

458
00:37:36,034 --> 00:37:37,262
I don't know.

459
00:37:38,203 --> 00:37:39,192
I won't.

460
00:37:41,472 --> 00:37:43,269
The newspaper.

461
00:37:57,689 --> 00:37:58,986
This is DarryI.

462
00:38:00,525 --> 00:38:03,688
-Wlll you accept the charges?
-Why, yes, I wiII, operator.

463
00:38:06,397 --> 00:38:08,763
TheIma, where in the sam hiII are you?

464
00:38:10,235 --> 00:38:11,759
I'm with Louise.

465
00:38:11,836 --> 00:38:14,737
We're in the mountains, fishin'.

466
00:38:15,106 --> 00:38:17,267
Have you Iost your mind? Is that it?

467
00:38:17,775 --> 00:38:21,108
I Ieave for work, and you take
compIete Ieave of your senses?

468
00:38:21,879 --> 00:38:23,870
DarryI, caIm down, pIease.

469
00:38:24,382 --> 00:38:26,748
Don't get so mad. I can expIain, okay?

470
00:38:27,852 --> 00:38:30,218
-You see, Louise--
-HoId on! HoId on!

471
00:38:32,490 --> 00:38:34,082
Now, come on, pick it!

472
00:38:35,927 --> 00:38:37,827
Shit. Go!

473
00:38:41,532 --> 00:38:45,161
We're just gonna stay there,
fish and hang out and stuff and...

474
00:38:45,370 --> 00:38:47,861
...we'II be gone one more day.
We'II be home tomorrow.

475
00:38:47,939 --> 00:38:50,203
No, you won't. You'II be back today.

476
00:38:50,675 --> 00:38:53,473
Now, you get your butt
back here, TheIma, now.

477
00:38:54,212 --> 00:38:55,736
Goddamn it!

478
00:39:00,518 --> 00:39:03,919
DarryI, you're my husband not my father.

479
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:08,681
That Louise is nothin' but a bad infIuence!

480
00:39:09,327 --> 00:39:11,625
If you're not back here by tonight...

481
00:39:14,499 --> 00:39:15,659
...TheIma...

482
00:39:17,268 --> 00:39:19,998
...weII then, I just don't wanna say.

483
00:39:24,542 --> 00:39:25,531
TheIma?

484
00:39:26,344 --> 00:39:27,936
Go fuck yourseIf.

485
00:39:31,949 --> 00:39:34,076
That's good, that's just sweet.

486
00:39:38,790 --> 00:39:39,688
Shit!

487
00:39:39,757 --> 00:39:41,884
DarIing, you aII right? Are you okay?

488
00:39:41,959 --> 00:39:43,950
-Did I cause that?
-No, I'm sorry.

489
00:39:44,028 --> 00:39:45,393
No? You okay?

490
00:39:45,997 --> 00:39:48,124
AII right. Is there something
I can do for you?

491
00:39:48,199 --> 00:39:49,496
No, it's okay.

492
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:57,205
Crazy women.

493
00:40:40,351 --> 00:40:42,012
Excuse me, ma'am.

494
00:40:42,086 --> 00:40:43,451
May I ask where you're heading?

495
00:40:43,521 --> 00:40:46,752
I'm trying to get back to schooI.
My ride feII through....

496
00:40:47,458 --> 00:40:49,255
I'm stuck here Iike stink on stink.

497
00:40:49,327 --> 00:40:52,819
So, I was thinking,
if you're goin' my way or...

498
00:40:53,398 --> 00:40:54,729
...if I'm going your way.

499
00:40:54,799 --> 00:40:57,063
I think we're going to OkIahoma City.

500
00:40:57,168 --> 00:40:58,533
But I'm not sure.

501
00:40:58,669 --> 00:41:01,137
Yeah, weII, I'd appreciate it much.

502
00:41:02,874 --> 00:41:05,843
WeII, see, it's reaIIy not up to me.
It's not my car.

503
00:41:07,645 --> 00:41:09,442
We'd have to ask my friend.

504
00:41:10,281 --> 00:41:12,340
But, she'd probabIy say no.

505
00:41:12,450 --> 00:41:13,883
She's a IittIe bit uptight.

506
00:41:13,951 --> 00:41:15,748
Maybe it's not such a good idea.

507
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:17,811
But, I thank you for your time.

508
00:41:18,256 --> 00:41:21,157
But, you know, I can ask. It wouIdn't hurt.

509
00:41:21,826 --> 00:41:24,124
WeII, no, it wouIdn't hurt.

510
00:41:24,695 --> 00:41:25,889
Hey, Louise.

511
00:41:29,734 --> 00:41:32,066
This young man here's
on his way back to schooI...

512
00:41:32,136 --> 00:41:35,230
...and I thought since we're going
in the same direction...

513
00:41:35,306 --> 00:41:37,399
...we couId give him a ride, huh?

514
00:41:40,678 --> 00:41:42,942
It's probabIy not a good idea.

515
00:41:44,715 --> 00:41:48,549
No, probabIy not, but I appreciate
your time. You aII have a good day.

516
00:41:48,619 --> 00:41:49,745
Drive safe.

517
00:41:57,061 --> 00:41:59,689
Did you see how poIite he is?
He was so sweet.

518
00:41:59,764 --> 00:42:01,254
-TheIma.
-What?

519
00:42:03,668 --> 00:42:04,657
Bye.

520
00:42:16,314 --> 00:42:17,474
FiII 'er up.

521
00:42:18,349 --> 00:42:20,874
Sure wish we couId have
brought him with us.

522
00:42:21,853 --> 00:42:23,582
What did DarryI have to say?

523
00:42:24,622 --> 00:42:28,285
He said, ''Okay, TheIma, I just wanted
to make sure you was aII right.

524
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:30,689
''Hope you're havin' fun.
You deserve it.

525
00:42:30,761 --> 00:42:33,855
''After aII you've put up with me.
I Iove you honey.''

526
00:42:40,972 --> 00:42:43,805
So, how Iong before
we're in goddamn Mexico?

527
00:43:05,296 --> 00:43:08,527
I just didn't think it wouId hurt
to give somebody a ride.

528
00:43:09,033 --> 00:43:10,660
Did you see his butt?

529
00:43:11,636 --> 00:43:13,365
DarryI don't have a cute butt.

530
00:43:13,437 --> 00:43:16,065
You couId park a car
in the shadow of his ass.

531
00:43:17,241 --> 00:43:20,506
I'm sorry. I'm just not in the mood
for company right now.

532
00:43:23,948 --> 00:43:27,315
Here, take this map. I need you to find
aII the secondary roads...

533
00:43:27,385 --> 00:43:29,410
...to Mexico from OkIahoma City.

534
00:43:29,754 --> 00:43:33,315
I think we shouId stay off the interstate.
We're too conspicuous.

535
00:43:34,792 --> 00:43:37,488
Looks Iike we couId get
on this Road 81 here...

536
00:43:38,129 --> 00:43:39,653
...and head down towards DaIIas.

537
00:43:39,730 --> 00:43:43,496
No, I don't want to go through Texas.
Find some way we don't have to.

538
00:43:45,503 --> 00:43:46,629
Wait.

539
00:43:47,271 --> 00:43:48,169
What?

540
00:43:49,407 --> 00:43:51,466
You want to go to Mexico
from OkIahoma...

541
00:43:51,542 --> 00:43:54,010
...but you don't want to go through Texas?

542
00:43:54,178 --> 00:43:57,375
You know how I feeI about Texas!
We're not goin' that way!

543
00:43:58,115 --> 00:44:00,640
Yeah, I know, Louise,
but we're running for our Iives.

544
00:44:00,718 --> 00:44:02,811
I mean, can't you make an exception?

545
00:44:03,154 --> 00:44:06,453
Look at this map.
The onIy thing between OkIahoma...

546
00:44:06,524 --> 00:44:10,483
-...and Mexico is Texas. Look!
-I'm not gonna taIk about this.

547
00:44:10,561 --> 00:44:13,792
You find another way or give me
the goddamn map and I wiII!

548
00:44:14,131 --> 00:44:16,964
-Do you understand?
-No, Louise, I don't.

549
00:44:18,169 --> 00:44:21,434
Now, how come you never toId me
what happened to you there?

550
00:44:25,676 --> 00:44:28,509
Look, you shoot off a guy's head...

551
00:44:28,579 --> 00:44:30,706
...with his pants down, Texas is not...

552
00:44:30,781 --> 00:44:32,908
...the pIace you wanna get caught.

553
00:44:33,484 --> 00:44:34,712
Now, trust me.

554
00:44:34,785 --> 00:44:37,276
Now, I'm not gonna taIk
about this anymore.

555
00:45:15,526 --> 00:45:17,391
Happy birthday, Iady.

556
00:46:00,805 --> 00:46:02,136
Is the manager in?

557
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:05,474
Marian, there's a poIice officer here.

558
00:46:28,265 --> 00:46:30,495
AII right, TheIma. AII right.

559
00:46:32,236 --> 00:46:33,464
Okay.

560
00:47:04,135 --> 00:47:07,434
The other night there was a murder
out at the SiIver BuIIet.

561
00:47:08,405 --> 00:47:09,667
A man was shot.

562
00:47:10,741 --> 00:47:14,677
And we have some witnesses
that saw a 1966...

563
00:47:14,745 --> 00:47:17,145
...T-Bird convertibIe Ieaving the scene.

564
00:47:17,948 --> 00:47:20,439
Sort of speeding out of the driveway there.

565
00:47:20,618 --> 00:47:23,781
And that vehicIe is registered
to one, Louise Sawyer.

566
00:47:25,422 --> 00:47:29,756
We have reason to beIieve that your wife
was the other occupant of that car.

567
00:47:32,663 --> 00:47:33,561
What?

568
00:47:41,305 --> 00:47:42,363
Excuse me.

569
00:47:42,773 --> 00:47:44,707
You're standing in your pizza.

570
00:47:45,276 --> 00:47:46,800
Oh! Shit!

571
00:47:48,045 --> 00:47:50,513
TeII me, Ms. TheIma.
Why ain't you got any kids?

572
00:47:50,581 --> 00:47:54,517
I mean, God gives you somethin' speciaI,
I think you ought to pass it on.

573
00:47:55,186 --> 00:47:58,349
-WeII, DarryI, that's my husband--
-DarryI?

574
00:47:58,522 --> 00:48:00,615
Yeah, he says he's not ready yet.

575
00:48:00,825 --> 00:48:02,690
Says he's stiII a kid himseIf.

576
00:48:03,093 --> 00:48:05,493
Kind of prides himseIf on being infantiIe.

577
00:48:05,563 --> 00:48:08,464
-He has a Iot to be proud of.
-Louise and him don't get aIong.

578
00:48:08,532 --> 00:48:10,056
WeII, that's putting it miIdIy.

579
00:48:10,134 --> 00:48:12,728
-She thinks he's a pig.
-I know he's a pig.

580
00:48:14,371 --> 00:48:16,862
Did you get married
reaI young, Ms. TheIma?

581
00:48:17,107 --> 00:48:19,098
WeII, I guess 18's kinda young.

582
00:48:21,846 --> 00:48:25,509
But we'd aIready been going out
for four years when we got married.

583
00:48:25,883 --> 00:48:27,783
-Out for how Iong?
-Four years.

584
00:48:28,686 --> 00:48:30,950
I never been with anybody but DarryI.

585
00:48:31,622 --> 00:48:33,453
Oh, I'm sorry.

586
00:48:34,258 --> 00:48:36,089
If you don't mind me saying so...

587
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:38,253
...he sounds Iike a reaI asshoIe.

588
00:48:39,930 --> 00:48:41,022
It's okay.

589
00:48:41,532 --> 00:48:42,897
He is an asshoIe.

590
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:45,700
But most of the time I just Iet it sIide.

591
00:48:47,938 --> 00:48:51,374
You better sIow down there, Ms. Louise.
That's a cop up ahead.

592
00:49:28,512 --> 00:49:31,106
Maybe you got
a few too many parking tickets.

593
00:49:31,982 --> 00:49:34,780
We'II take you to OkIahoma City,
then you go your own way.

594
00:49:34,852 --> 00:49:36,080
AII right.

595
00:49:43,627 --> 00:49:47,085
Prints on the trunk of the car
match those of TheIma Dickinson.

596
00:49:47,498 --> 00:49:49,693
I'II be damned. Isn't that strange?

597
00:49:49,833 --> 00:49:52,131
And the husband says a gun is missing.

598
00:49:52,670 --> 00:49:54,365
She took a Iot of stuff.

599
00:49:55,205 --> 00:49:58,231
It Iooks Iike she maybe pIanned
on being gone a whiIe.

600
00:49:58,509 --> 00:50:00,136
The strange thing is...

601
00:50:00,644 --> 00:50:03,511
...her husband said
she wouId never touch that gun.

602
00:50:04,515 --> 00:50:07,211
He got it for her 'cause he's out Iate a Iot...

603
00:50:08,352 --> 00:50:10,047
...but he said she'd never touch it...

604
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:13,783
...wouIdn't Iearn to shoot it.
Just kept it in a drawer for years.

605
00:50:14,024 --> 00:50:16,083
-What kind of gun was it?
-38.

606
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:18,021
Right. Where are they?

607
00:50:18,095 --> 00:50:20,620
They were on their way
to some guy's cabin...

608
00:50:20,698 --> 00:50:21,926
...and they never showed up.

609
00:50:25,636 --> 00:50:27,695
AII right. Now I'm gonna go in....

610
00:50:27,771 --> 00:50:29,329
Listen up, you two, I'm going in...

611
00:50:29,406 --> 00:50:33,103
...it's just gonna take a minute.
You two better say your good-byes.

612
00:50:40,851 --> 00:50:43,786
I'm here to pick up a money order
for Louise Sawyer.

613
00:50:46,957 --> 00:50:48,322
There's nothing.

614
00:50:49,393 --> 00:50:52,453
How about ''Peaches''?
CouId you try code word ''Peaches''?

615
00:50:53,163 --> 00:50:55,290
Did I hear somebody say ''Peaches''?

616
00:50:56,467 --> 00:50:59,300
-My God. Jimmy.
-That's the secret word.

617
00:51:00,771 --> 00:51:02,739
Show the Iady what she's won, Don.

618
00:51:05,075 --> 00:51:06,667
What are you doin' here?

619
00:51:06,744 --> 00:51:08,678
I just came to see you, baby.

620
00:51:11,281 --> 00:51:14,512
Can I have another room, pIease?
Put it on my credit card.

621
00:51:23,560 --> 00:51:26,154
TheIma, get your foot down.

622
00:51:26,263 --> 00:51:27,730
Look who's here.

623
00:51:28,132 --> 00:51:31,363
Oh, shit! Jimmy. Hi, stranger.

624
00:51:31,902 --> 00:51:33,460
What on earth are you doin' here?

625
00:51:33,537 --> 00:51:36,165
Ask me no questions
and I'II teII you no Iies.

626
00:51:36,573 --> 00:51:38,939
Good answer. Same goes doubIe for me.

627
00:51:40,244 --> 00:51:43,475
-Who's the cowboy?
-Oh, this here, this is J.D.

628
00:51:43,614 --> 00:51:47,209
He's a student.
We're just giving him a ride to here.

629
00:51:47,284 --> 00:51:50,742
And then he, Louise said
that he wouId have to go, so he's gone...

630
00:51:50,821 --> 00:51:53,722
...I guess that's where he's going to.

631
00:51:53,824 --> 00:51:54,916
He's gone.

632
00:51:55,325 --> 00:51:57,384
-Have a good trip.
-Thank you.

633
00:51:57,528 --> 00:51:58,927
Nice meeting you.

634
00:52:02,533 --> 00:52:05,263
That's him goin'. I Iove watchin' him go.

635
00:52:05,335 --> 00:52:07,064
TheIma kinda took to him.

636
00:52:07,271 --> 00:52:09,865
WeII, we got you a room there, TheIma.

637
00:52:09,973 --> 00:52:12,567
Go on in and take yourseIf
a nice coId shower.

638
00:52:12,643 --> 00:52:15,578
WeII, you know me, Jimmy,
I'm just a wiId woman.

639
00:52:28,425 --> 00:52:29,790
It's our future.

640
00:52:39,803 --> 00:52:41,600
What are you gonna teII him?

641
00:52:42,639 --> 00:52:43,628
Nothin'.

642
00:52:44,608 --> 00:52:46,599
I'm not gonna teII him a thing.

643
00:52:47,411 --> 00:52:51,177
The Ieast I can do is not make him
any more of an accessory than he is.

644
00:52:51,248 --> 00:52:54,308
You are so sweet to that guy.
You know, you reaIIy are.

645
00:52:54,451 --> 00:52:56,783
Imagine not wantin' to drag him into this.

646
00:52:56,854 --> 00:52:58,583
I didn't ask him to come.

647
00:52:58,822 --> 00:53:00,790
As I said, he's no different
than any other.

648
00:53:00,858 --> 00:53:02,826
He just Ioves the chase, is aII.

649
00:53:04,094 --> 00:53:06,494
He's sure got his work cut out
for him now, don't he?

650
00:53:06,563 --> 00:53:08,463
TheIma, just put a Iid on it!

651
00:53:10,834 --> 00:53:11,801
Now...

652
00:53:13,804 --> 00:53:16,329
...I want you to just, you guard that money.

653
00:53:17,274 --> 00:53:18,172
Okay.

654
00:53:18,575 --> 00:53:20,475
And if there's any probIem...

655
00:53:20,644 --> 00:53:22,669
...then you caII me in Room 211.

656
00:53:26,316 --> 00:53:27,681
I won't wait up.

657
00:53:45,969 --> 00:53:47,561
-You want a drink?
-No.

658
00:53:49,740 --> 00:53:52,038
Why don't you teII me what's goin' on?

659
00:53:53,777 --> 00:53:56,143
I'm not gonna teII you what's goin' on.

660
00:53:56,213 --> 00:53:57,942
Soon you'II understand why I can't...

661
00:53:58,015 --> 00:54:00,449
...but I'm not goin' to, so don't ask me.

662
00:54:04,054 --> 00:54:06,955
-Can I ask you one thing?
-Maybe.

663
00:54:07,791 --> 00:54:09,952
Are you in Iove with somebody eIse?

664
00:54:10,194 --> 00:54:12,924
Does this have somethin' to do
with another man?

665
00:54:13,096 --> 00:54:15,155
No, it's not anything Iike that.

666
00:54:18,235 --> 00:54:20,430
WeII then, what is it, goddamn it?

667
00:54:21,004 --> 00:54:23,495
Were you just gonna Ieave
for fucking ever?

668
00:54:24,741 --> 00:54:26,902
What, did you fuckin' kiII somebody?

669
00:54:26,977 --> 00:54:29,138
You start this shit, I'm outta here!

670
00:54:33,784 --> 00:54:34,978
I'm sorry.

671
00:54:41,258 --> 00:54:42,589
Come back here and sit down.

672
00:54:42,659 --> 00:54:44,524
I wanna give you somethin'.

673
00:54:44,595 --> 00:54:47,155
-I'm fine right here.
-I wanna give you somethin'.

674
00:54:47,231 --> 00:54:48,960
Give it to me here.

675
00:55:06,283 --> 00:55:08,251
Why don't you try it on?

676
00:55:11,321 --> 00:55:13,949
WeII, you didn't see
that one comin', did you?

677
00:55:15,125 --> 00:55:16,251
Why, Jimmy?

678
00:55:19,096 --> 00:55:20,120
Why, now?

679
00:55:22,799 --> 00:55:25,393
Try not to get too excited, Louise. I just...

680
00:55:26,003 --> 00:55:29,598
...fIew across two states
with that ring in my fuckin' hand and...

681
00:55:32,009 --> 00:55:33,738
...you know I hate to fIy.

682
00:55:36,246 --> 00:55:38,214
You came aII this way...

683
00:55:38,649 --> 00:55:41,379
...because you thought
I was with somebody eIse.

684
00:55:43,086 --> 00:55:44,883
No, that's not why I came.

685
00:55:48,925 --> 00:55:51,519
Because, you know,
I don't want to Iose you.

686
00:55:52,596 --> 00:55:55,463
And I get the feeIing
Iike you're gonna Iike spIit.

687
00:55:55,599 --> 00:55:58,659
-PermanentIy.
-That's not a good reason to get married.

688
00:56:00,604 --> 00:56:02,902
WeII, I thought that's what you wanted.

689
00:56:03,573 --> 00:56:04,540
I did.

690
00:56:06,443 --> 00:56:07,842
But not Iike this.

691
00:56:19,222 --> 00:56:21,918
-Louise?
-No, TheIma, it's me.

692
00:56:23,393 --> 00:56:24,417
Surprise.

693
00:56:26,129 --> 00:56:29,030
I was just out there
and I was just thinking that...

694
00:56:29,099 --> 00:56:31,829
...I know I'm supposed
to be gone and aII but...

695
00:56:33,103 --> 00:56:34,263
...you know.

696
00:56:37,774 --> 00:56:41,335
And I'm not havin' a turd's Iuck
getting a ride out in this rain.

697
00:56:42,179 --> 00:56:44,204
I was just thinkin' about you.

698
00:56:48,752 --> 00:56:50,515
This is crazy.

699
00:56:50,887 --> 00:56:53,481
I'm gonna get out of your hair, aII right?

700
00:56:53,890 --> 00:56:55,016
WeII.

701
00:56:55,225 --> 00:56:56,351
Wait.

702
00:56:57,627 --> 00:56:59,151
Where you goin'?

703
00:57:02,032 --> 00:57:05,058
Ah, I don't know. You know. Nowhere.

704
00:57:05,569 --> 00:57:07,298
You think I'm happy
with pIayin' gigs...

705
00:57:07,537 --> 00:57:09,266
...in Ramada Inn Iounges?

706
00:57:09,473 --> 00:57:11,941
You think it's just you
with dreams that don't happen?

707
00:57:12,008 --> 00:57:14,169
We both got what we settIed for.

708
00:57:14,678 --> 00:57:17,169
I think maybe
you just don't Iove me anymore.

709
00:57:17,247 --> 00:57:18,646
No, I do Iove you.

710
00:57:23,253 --> 00:57:25,312
But I think it's time to just...

711
00:57:27,924 --> 00:57:29,858
...Iet go of the oId mistakes.

712
00:57:32,162 --> 00:57:34,027
Just chaIk it up to...

713
00:57:35,932 --> 00:57:37,194
...bad timin'.

714
00:57:39,569 --> 00:57:41,400
I think it's time to Iet go.

715
00:57:44,073 --> 00:57:44,767
Again.

716
00:57:48,444 --> 00:57:49,570
Come on.

717
00:57:49,979 --> 00:57:51,606
You're too easy. Come on.

718
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:53,614
AII right, I'II do it.

719
00:57:54,283 --> 00:57:55,409
Come on.

720
00:57:56,118 --> 00:57:58,643
WeII, don't Ieave 'em, just Ieave 'em there.

721
00:58:04,093 --> 00:58:08,189
You see, this is an unfair advantage.
You got too much metaI goin' here.

722
00:58:09,198 --> 00:58:11,666
You want to Iighten the Ioad a IittIe bit?

723
00:58:15,871 --> 00:58:18,271
I think that's better. What do you think?

724
00:58:18,808 --> 00:58:20,105
Yeah, okay.

725
00:58:23,112 --> 00:58:26,138
-Take me, break me, make me mad!
-Watch your head.

726
00:58:26,415 --> 00:58:28,349
-CarefuI.
-Oh, my head's fine.

727
00:58:28,651 --> 00:58:30,551
Who are you, anyway?

728
00:58:32,621 --> 00:58:35,590
I'm the great and powerfuI Oz.
Who do you want to be?

729
00:58:35,758 --> 00:58:38,659
TeII me, I know you're not
just some schooIboy.

730
00:58:38,894 --> 00:58:42,159
-Nobody ever teIIs me shit.
-Oh, I'm just some guy.

731
00:58:42,398 --> 00:58:43,660
Guy whose paroIe officer...

732
00:58:43,732 --> 00:58:46,758
...is probabIy havin'
a shit fit right about now.

733
00:58:46,902 --> 00:58:48,995
What do you mean, paroIe officer?

734
00:58:49,705 --> 00:58:53,436
-What? Are you a criminaI?
-No, not no more, TheIma.

735
00:58:55,110 --> 00:58:58,671
Let's see, besides bustin' paroIe
I haven't done one wrong thing.

736
00:58:58,981 --> 00:59:01,677
-What'd you do?
-I'm a robber.

737
00:59:02,718 --> 00:59:05,118
-You're a bank robber?
-No.

738
00:59:05,688 --> 00:59:07,679
I don't rob no banks. Come on.

739
00:59:08,257 --> 00:59:09,884
What'd you rob?

740
00:59:12,761 --> 00:59:14,285
WeII, Iet's see.

741
00:59:14,930 --> 00:59:16,795
Let's add it up here, I...

742
00:59:17,867 --> 00:59:19,698
...robbed a gas station...

743
00:59:20,002 --> 00:59:22,994
...a coupIe of convenience stores,
Iiquor stores.

744
00:59:24,373 --> 00:59:25,635
Oh, my God.

745
00:59:27,610 --> 00:59:28,474
How?

746
00:59:30,779 --> 00:59:32,007
Come on.

747
00:59:33,816 --> 00:59:36,216
See, first you pick your pIace, aII right?

748
00:59:36,285 --> 00:59:38,515
Then I just sit back
and watch it for a whiIe.

749
00:59:38,587 --> 00:59:41,215
Wait for that right moment
to make my move, see?

750
00:59:41,290 --> 00:59:42,689
You gotta know it up here...

751
00:59:42,758 --> 00:59:45,784
...that shit cannot be taught. Yeah, then...

752
00:59:47,463 --> 00:59:50,921
-...I don't want to taIk about this.
-Come on. I do.

753
00:59:52,701 --> 00:59:53,895
AII right.

754
00:59:54,503 --> 00:59:56,164
Then I'd...

755
00:59:56,739 --> 00:59:58,900
...waItz right in, yep...

756
00:59:59,842 --> 01:00:02,504
...and I'd just kinda waItz on in and I'd say:

757
01:00:02,578 --> 01:00:03,738
''Ladies. GentIemen.

758
01:00:03,812 --> 01:00:05,939
''Let's see who best keeps their cooI.

759
01:00:06,015 --> 01:00:08,313
''Simon says:
Everybody down on the fIoor.

760
01:00:08,384 --> 01:00:11,683
''Now, nobody Ioses their head,
then nobody Ioses their head.

761
01:00:12,621 --> 01:00:14,680
''You, sir. You do the honors.

762
01:00:15,391 --> 01:00:17,256
''Take that cash and put it in the bag.

763
01:00:17,326 --> 01:00:19,260
''You've got a great story to teII friends.

764
01:00:19,328 --> 01:00:22,559
''If not, weII, you got a tag
on your toe. You decide.''

765
01:00:23,732 --> 01:00:25,632
It's as simpIe as that.

766
01:00:26,402 --> 01:00:28,097
Then I'd just sIip on out.

767
01:00:29,371 --> 01:00:32,363
And, get the heII out of Dodge, yeah.

768
01:00:35,210 --> 01:00:36,142
My goodness.

769
01:00:36,211 --> 01:00:38,406
You were sure gentIemanIy about it.

770
01:00:39,481 --> 01:00:41,676
I've aIways beIieved that done properIy...

771
01:00:41,750 --> 01:00:45,049
...armed robbery doesn't have to be
a totaIIy unpIeasant experience.

772
01:00:47,323 --> 01:00:47,982
What?

773
01:00:48,057 --> 01:00:50,355
You're a reaI Iive outIaw, aren't you?

774
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:52,686
I may be an outIaw, darIin', but...

775
01:00:53,162 --> 01:00:55,357
...you're the one steaIin' my heart.

776
01:00:56,298 --> 01:00:58,596
Oh, smooth. Oh, you're smooth.

777
01:00:58,867 --> 01:01:00,664
Isn't he?

778
01:01:01,503 --> 01:01:02,595
I sure am.

779
01:01:02,771 --> 01:01:04,398
Keep it that way.

780
01:01:11,347 --> 01:01:13,144
Remember when we first met?

781
01:01:17,886 --> 01:01:19,854
What happened? TeII me what you said.

782
01:01:19,922 --> 01:01:22,823
I said you had a nice pair of eyes.

783
01:01:24,626 --> 01:01:25,991
And what'd I say?

784
01:01:26,528 --> 01:01:27,859
Do you remember?

785
01:01:30,833 --> 01:01:32,266
You shut 'em.

786
01:01:32,835 --> 01:01:35,235
Asked me if I knew what coIor they were.

787
01:01:36,805 --> 01:01:38,272
And what'd you say?

788
01:01:40,342 --> 01:01:41,775
I didn't know.

789
01:01:46,348 --> 01:01:48,646
Jimmy, what coIor are my eyes?

790
01:01:52,688 --> 01:01:54,121
They're brown.

791
01:02:34,830 --> 01:02:36,195
Wait.

792
01:04:07,489 --> 01:04:09,787
You aII want some more coffee?

793
01:04:10,392 --> 01:04:11,484
Thank you.

794
01:04:21,069 --> 01:04:24,766
Look, I don't know what's goin' on
with you, or what happened, or...

795
01:04:24,907 --> 01:04:27,102
...what you aII did...

796
01:04:28,143 --> 01:04:30,839
...but I'm not gonna teII anybody
and I'm not gonna...

797
01:04:30,913 --> 01:04:33,074
...say that I even saw you.

798
01:04:37,519 --> 01:04:39,350
What'd you do? Take some kind of piII?

799
01:04:39,421 --> 01:04:41,548
Makes you say aII the right stuff?

800
01:04:45,694 --> 01:04:47,321
I'm chokin' on it.

801
01:04:51,433 --> 01:04:53,993
You sure you don't want me
to go with you?

802
01:04:55,103 --> 01:04:58,072
I think it's probabIy not
a reaI good idea right now.

803
01:04:58,907 --> 01:05:01,569
But I'II catch up with you Iater.

804
01:05:02,644 --> 01:05:04,339
On down the road.

805
01:05:11,820 --> 01:05:12,912
WeII....

806
01:05:14,656 --> 01:05:15,953
My taxi's here.

807
01:05:21,697 --> 01:05:23,631
Why don't you just keep that?

808
01:05:26,168 --> 01:05:27,157
Thanks.

809
01:05:29,171 --> 01:05:31,196
I just want you to be happy.

810
01:05:32,374 --> 01:05:33,841
I am happy, sweetie.

811
01:05:34,710 --> 01:05:36,200
Happy as I can be.

812
01:05:38,680 --> 01:05:39,908
AII right.

813
01:05:43,585 --> 01:05:46,816
Why don't you give oI' Jimmy
a kiss goodbye?

814
01:05:47,389 --> 01:05:49,949
And, I'II be gettin' out of here.

815
01:05:53,996 --> 01:05:55,691
Come here, IittIe Jimmy.

816
01:06:30,966 --> 01:06:33,161
-I'II be seeing you, Louise.
-I know.

817
01:06:38,607 --> 01:06:40,768
Okay, have a safe trip.

818
01:06:54,723 --> 01:06:56,987
It's a good thing he Ieft when he did.

819
01:06:57,326 --> 01:07:00,056
We thought we were gonna
have to put out a fire.

820
01:07:14,343 --> 01:07:16,311
What happened to your hair?

821
01:07:16,378 --> 01:07:18,278
Nothin'. Got messed up.

822
01:07:20,482 --> 01:07:22,416
TheIma, what's wrong with you?

823
01:07:23,018 --> 01:07:24,485
Nothin'.

824
01:07:24,586 --> 01:07:26,986
Why, do I seem different?

825
01:07:28,290 --> 01:07:29,985
Now that you mention it, yeah...

826
01:07:30,058 --> 01:07:33,255
...you seem Iike you're crazy
or you're on drugs.

827
01:07:35,697 --> 01:07:38,860
I'm not on drugs. But I might be crazy!

828
01:07:44,339 --> 01:07:45,931
TheIma, what happened?

829
01:07:49,411 --> 01:07:51,379
-What happened?
-J.D. came back.

830
01:07:51,446 --> 01:07:52,913
Oh, my God, Louise.

831
01:07:53,215 --> 01:07:54,341
-No!
-I can't beIieve....

832
01:07:54,416 --> 01:07:56,907
-I mean I just can't beIieve it.
-No!

833
01:07:57,185 --> 01:07:59,050
Oh, my God, it's Iike....

834
01:08:00,889 --> 01:08:02,880
I now understand
what aII the fuss is about.

835
01:08:02,958 --> 01:08:05,654
Now, it's Iike a whoIe 'nother baII game.

836
01:08:05,761 --> 01:08:07,854
Oh, darIin', I'm so happy for you.

837
01:08:07,929 --> 01:08:10,124
That's great. I reaIIy am.

838
01:08:10,766 --> 01:08:13,530
You finaIIy got Iaid properIy.
That's so sweet.

839
01:08:15,704 --> 01:08:18,366
-Where is he now?
-He's takin' a shower.

840
01:08:20,942 --> 01:08:23,240
TheIma, you Ieft him aIone in the room?

841
01:08:26,014 --> 01:08:28,983
Where's the money?
My God, TheIma, where's the money?

842
01:08:29,151 --> 01:08:32,143
It's on the bed tabIe. It's okay.

843
01:08:34,856 --> 01:08:37,882
It's on the nightstand! It's okay.

844
01:08:45,066 --> 01:08:46,158
Goddamn it!

845
01:08:47,402 --> 01:08:49,734
I've never been Iucky! Not one time!

846
01:08:51,640 --> 01:08:52,698
Shit!

847
01:08:53,909 --> 01:08:55,069
Son of a bitch robbed me.

848
01:08:55,143 --> 01:08:56,610
I don't beIieve it.

849
01:09:02,417 --> 01:09:03,782
Louise...

850
01:09:05,554 --> 01:09:06,714
...you okay?

851
01:09:09,925 --> 01:09:10,983
Louise...

852
01:09:13,962 --> 01:09:15,691
...I'm sorry, I mean it.

853
01:09:21,903 --> 01:09:24,064
Louise, it's okay.

854
01:09:26,374 --> 01:09:29,138
-It's okay.
-No, TheIma, it's not okay.

855
01:09:30,078 --> 01:09:31,978
It's definiteIy not okay.

856
01:09:34,449 --> 01:09:36,474
None of this is okay.

857
01:09:37,185 --> 01:09:38,584
I mean...

858
01:09:38,987 --> 01:09:40,511
...what are we gonna do for money?

859
01:09:40,589 --> 01:09:41,487
Huh?

860
01:09:41,890 --> 01:09:43,687
How we gonna get gas?

861
01:09:43,959 --> 01:09:46,325
I mean, tradin' on our good Iooks?

862
01:09:49,764 --> 01:09:52,460
Goddamn it, TheIma, it's not okay.

863
01:09:58,039 --> 01:10:01,099
Louise, hey, now you Iisten to me.

864
01:10:02,944 --> 01:10:05,606
Don't you worry about it. You hear me?

865
01:10:06,748 --> 01:10:08,716
Come on. Stand up.

866
01:10:10,986 --> 01:10:13,511
Louise, just don't worry about it.

867
01:10:13,922 --> 01:10:15,355
You hear?

868
01:10:15,724 --> 01:10:16,713
Come on.

869
01:10:19,594 --> 01:10:21,186
Come on, baby. Damn it!

870
01:10:21,296 --> 01:10:23,696
Get your stuff and Iet's get out of here.

871
01:10:24,933 --> 01:10:25,865
Move!

872
01:10:26,368 --> 01:10:27,960
Jesus Christ, come on.

873
01:10:30,972 --> 01:10:34,373
Take your damn time.
Come on, here we go.

874
01:10:56,965 --> 01:10:57,897
Damn!

875
01:11:03,438 --> 01:11:05,668
Afraid of a IittIe rain, Max?

876
01:11:09,978 --> 01:11:12,572
WeII, come on in. Wipe your feet.

877
01:11:25,961 --> 01:11:28,259
As you know, we've tapped your phone...

878
01:11:28,597 --> 01:11:30,724
...in the event that she caIIs in.

879
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:33,158
Is that gonna cost me?

880
01:11:34,002 --> 01:11:35,094
Excuse me, may I?

881
01:11:35,170 --> 01:11:37,900
Live it up. That's what it's there for.

882
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:41,666
We're going to have someone here,
at the house, on the phones...

883
01:11:41,743 --> 01:11:43,335
...untiI we find them.

884
01:11:44,079 --> 01:11:46,946
The important thing is not to Iet on
that you know anything.

885
01:11:47,015 --> 01:11:49,279
We'II try to find out where they are.

886
01:11:49,618 --> 01:11:51,779
I don't want to get too personaI...

887
01:11:52,520 --> 01:11:55,546
...but do you have
a good reIationship with your wife?

888
01:11:56,691 --> 01:11:58,249
I Iove TheIma.

889
01:11:59,561 --> 01:12:01,825
I don't intend anything by that, sir.

890
01:12:02,497 --> 01:12:05,364
It's just a question I have to ask.
Are you cIose with her?

891
01:12:05,433 --> 01:12:07,458
Yeah. I guess.

892
01:12:07,936 --> 01:12:08,834
I mean...

893
01:12:08,903 --> 01:12:12,100
...I'm about as cIose as I can be
to a nutcase Iike that.

894
01:12:17,112 --> 01:12:20,604
WeII, if she caIIs, just be gentIe.

895
01:12:22,117 --> 01:12:25,143
You know, Iike,
you're reaIIy happy to hear from her.

896
01:12:25,620 --> 01:12:27,349
Like you reaIIy miss her.

897
01:12:27,889 --> 01:12:29,379
Women Iove that shit.

898
01:12:32,794 --> 01:12:34,421
Okay, if you say so.

899
01:12:39,134 --> 01:12:40,601
''Women Iove that shit.''

900
01:12:40,835 --> 01:12:41,358
Sorry it's just....

901
01:12:55,617 --> 01:12:57,642
Oh, cooI. Can I wear these?

902
01:13:05,360 --> 01:13:06,622
Want anything?

903
01:14:07,655 --> 01:14:09,247
Drive, Louise!

904
01:14:09,791 --> 01:14:12,055
Drive! Start the car!

905
01:14:16,664 --> 01:14:17,653
Go!

906
01:14:22,403 --> 01:14:23,961
What happened?

907
01:14:25,073 --> 01:14:26,370
You robbed the store?

908
01:14:26,441 --> 01:14:30,377
-You robbed the goddamned store?
-WeII, we needed the money.

909
01:14:30,878 --> 01:14:33,540
-It's not Iike I kiIIed anybody.
-TheIma!

910
01:14:33,614 --> 01:14:34,273
I'm sorry.

911
01:14:34,348 --> 01:14:36,509
We needed the money, now we have it.

912
01:14:36,751 --> 01:14:39,413
Oh, shit! Oh, shit, TheIma!

913
01:14:39,487 --> 01:14:40,886
-Louise.
-Oh, shit.

914
01:14:40,955 --> 01:14:43,753
Come on, get a grip.
Drive us to Mexico, wiII you?

915
01:14:43,925 --> 01:14:45,017

916
01:14:45,426 --> 01:14:46,654

Good God.

943
01:15:51,359 --> 01:15:52,326
My Lord.

944
01:16:02,436 --> 01:16:05,132
Hey, Louise. Better sIow down.

945
01:16:05,806 --> 01:16:08,570
I'd just die if we got caught
over a speeding ticket.

946
01:16:08,643 --> 01:16:12,409
You know, for the first time in my Iife
I wish this car wasn't green.

947
01:16:13,781 --> 01:16:14,907
ShouId we drive Iike this?

948
01:16:15,149 --> 01:16:16,480
In broad dayIight and aII?

949
01:16:16,551 --> 01:16:18,849
No, but I want to put
some distance between us...

950
01:16:18,920 --> 01:16:21,787
...and the scene of our Iast goddamn crime!

951
01:16:25,693 --> 01:16:28,787
Oh, man, you wouIdn't have beIieved it.

952
01:16:29,063 --> 01:16:30,860
It was if I'd been doin' it aII my Iife.

953
01:16:30,932 --> 01:16:32,923
I mean, nobody wouId beIieve it.

954
01:16:34,168 --> 01:16:36,636
-Think you found your caIIin'?
-Maybe.

955
01:16:38,206 --> 01:16:40,231
The caII of the wiId!

956
01:16:42,777 --> 01:16:46,406
-You are disturbed!
-Yeah! I beIieve I am.

957
01:17:01,562 --> 01:17:03,621
TheIma. Don't you Iitter.

958
01:17:06,167 --> 01:17:08,067
Wait a minute. Shit.

959
01:17:08,302 --> 01:17:09,098
God, I hate when....

960
01:17:09,170 --> 01:17:11,661
This aIways happens
when you're in a hurry.

961
01:17:12,440 --> 01:17:13,202
Damn.

962
01:17:13,274 --> 01:17:15,970
What are you gonna do?
Just stay drunk aII day?

963
01:17:17,311 --> 01:17:18,403
Try to.

964
01:17:24,018 --> 01:17:26,953
Oh, isn't that nice?
Truck drivers are aIways so nice.

965
01:17:27,021 --> 01:17:28,852
Best drivers on the road.

966
01:17:34,095 --> 01:17:35,119
Look.

967
01:17:35,663 --> 01:17:37,221
How originaI.

968
01:17:45,072 --> 01:17:47,404
-Hey, hi.
-Thank you.

969
01:17:49,710 --> 01:17:51,439
Oh, man, that's disgustin'!

970
01:17:51,512 --> 01:17:54,379
Oh! You pig! You pig!
Just a fucking pig! That's gross.

971
01:17:54,448 --> 01:17:57,246
-What's he gotta do that for?
-Oh! I don't know.

972
01:17:57,752 --> 01:18:01,518
They think we Iike it.
They think it turns us on.

973
01:18:02,323 --> 01:18:03,347
Shut up!

974
01:18:41,295 --> 01:18:42,762
James Lennox?

975
01:18:43,698 --> 01:18:44,756
Yeah, who wants to know?

976
01:18:44,832 --> 01:18:46,424
Arkansas State PoIice.

977
01:19:21,535 --> 01:19:22,433
Hi.

978
01:20:02,209 --> 01:20:03,369
TheIma!

979
01:20:06,814 --> 01:20:07,678
What?

980
01:20:08,048 --> 01:20:09,777
I want you to caII DarryI.

981
01:20:11,085 --> 01:20:12,347
What for?

982
01:20:16,056 --> 01:20:20,083
I want you to find out if he knows
anything. If you think he does...

983
01:20:20,628 --> 01:20:21,890
...you gotta hang up....

984
01:20:21,962 --> 01:20:23,361
Means the cops have toId him...

985
01:20:23,431 --> 01:20:25,592
...and the phone's probabIy tapped.

986
01:20:25,833 --> 01:20:27,198
Tapped the phone?

987
01:20:27,568 --> 01:20:29,365
What are you taIkin' about?

988
01:20:29,570 --> 01:20:32,198
Come on, TheIma.
Murder One and armed robbery.

989
01:20:32,306 --> 01:20:33,273
Murder One?

990
01:20:33,340 --> 01:20:34,830
We can't say it was seIf defense?

991
01:20:34,909 --> 01:20:36,638
It wasn't. We were waIkin' away.

992
01:20:36,710 --> 01:20:40,077
Yeah, but they don't know that.
It was just you and me there.

993
01:20:40,214 --> 01:20:41,681
It was rape, you had to shoot.

994
01:20:41,749 --> 01:20:43,444
That's aImost the truth.

995
01:20:43,717 --> 01:20:45,344
-It won't work.
-Why not?

996
01:20:45,853 --> 01:20:48,651
There's no physicaI evidence.
We can't prove he did it.

997
01:20:48,722 --> 01:20:52,385
We can't even probabIy prove by now
that he touched you.

998
01:20:53,461 --> 01:20:54,325
God.

999
01:20:55,329 --> 01:20:58,162
Law is some tricky shit, isn't it?

1000
01:21:01,869 --> 01:21:03,598
How do you know about aII this stuff?

1001
01:21:03,671 --> 01:21:05,639
Besides, what'II we say about the robbery?

1002
01:21:05,706 --> 01:21:06,900
There's no excuse for that.

1003
01:21:06,974 --> 01:21:09,442
There's no such thing
as justifiabIe robbery.

1004
01:21:09,510 --> 01:21:12,673
AII right, Louise, wiII you?
Where'd you get this?

1005
01:21:13,647 --> 01:21:14,671
StoIe it.

1006
01:21:27,061 --> 01:21:28,119
Hi.

1007
01:21:28,996 --> 01:21:29,963
Hi!

1008
01:21:33,901 --> 01:21:35,266
Who's the nut?

1009
01:21:35,769 --> 01:21:37,794
That's Mrs. Dickinson's husband.

1010
01:21:38,439 --> 01:21:40,771
Shit twice and faII back in it.

1011
01:21:41,575 --> 01:21:42,439
God.

1012
01:21:45,045 --> 01:21:47,411
Where'd you get the $6,600 in cash?

1013
01:21:49,850 --> 01:21:50,839
A friend.

1014
01:21:51,452 --> 01:21:53,977
We spoke with a man today
who says he deIivered...

1015
01:21:54,054 --> 01:21:56,682
...very cIose to that same amount
to a Ms. Louise Sawyer.

1016
01:21:56,757 --> 01:21:58,281
Do you know her, too?

1017
01:22:00,194 --> 01:22:01,388
Yes, sir.

1018
01:22:01,829 --> 01:22:04,354
I beIieve she was
the woman drivin' the car.

1019
01:22:04,999 --> 01:22:07,695
He said he took it to a moteI
in OkIahoma City.

1020
01:22:08,102 --> 01:22:10,627
He aIso says that at that time
he met a man.

1021
01:22:11,372 --> 01:22:14,102
He identified you
through a series of mug shots.

1022
01:22:14,708 --> 01:22:17,973
He aIso toId us that you
and Mrs. Dickinson seemed ''cIose.''

1023
01:22:18,712 --> 01:22:19,940
Is that true?

1024
01:22:20,781 --> 01:22:21,873
WeII, sir.

1025
01:22:23,083 --> 01:22:26,143
You might say
we had a meetin' of the minds, yeah.

1026
01:22:27,555 --> 01:22:29,147
Are you aware that Mrs. Dickinson...

1027
01:22:29,223 --> 01:22:31,714
...and Ms. Sawyer are wanted
with regards to a murder?

1028
01:22:31,792 --> 01:22:33,987
Murder? What, TheIma? Damn!

1029
01:22:34,995 --> 01:22:38,590
Did they ever indicate that they might be
on the run from the Iaw?

1030
01:22:39,733 --> 01:22:41,462
Now that you mention it...

1031
01:22:41,569 --> 01:22:44,094
...they might have seemed
a IittIe bit jumpy.

1032
01:22:44,605 --> 01:22:46,402
-You know what?
-What?

1033
01:22:47,408 --> 01:22:49,308
You're starting to irritate me.

1034
01:22:49,376 --> 01:22:50,604
Me, too.

1035
01:22:51,345 --> 01:22:52,835
WeII, that'II happen.

1036
01:22:53,614 --> 01:22:54,774
You boys've much in common.

1037
01:22:54,848 --> 01:22:57,715
Maybe I shouId just step out
of the room for a sec.

1038
01:23:00,754 --> 01:23:02,654
I got a better idea.

1039
01:23:04,525 --> 01:23:07,358
Do you mind if I speak to him aIone,
for a minute?

1040
01:23:25,579 --> 01:23:27,979
What? What'd I do? Nothin', that's what.

1041
01:23:28,449 --> 01:23:30,940
TeII you somethin',
this is just a crock of shit...

1042
01:23:31,018 --> 01:23:33,248
...Mr. John fucking Law.

1043
01:23:40,794 --> 01:23:43,285
Son, I got a feeIing about something and...

1044
01:23:43,831 --> 01:23:45,856
...I just wanna ask your opinion.

1045
01:23:48,002 --> 01:23:50,937
You think TheIma Dickinson
wouId've committed armed robbery...

1046
01:23:51,005 --> 01:23:53,371
...if you hadn't taken aII their money?

1047
01:23:55,042 --> 01:23:57,101
Get your foot off that tabIe.

1048
01:24:02,216 --> 01:24:05,014
-Cat got your tongue?
-No, naw.

1049
01:24:05,819 --> 01:24:07,377
WeII, how do you know I took it?

1050
01:24:07,454 --> 01:24:09,888
How do you know they didn't--

1051
01:24:10,724 --> 01:24:12,555
Don't you fucking Iie to me!

1052
01:24:13,794 --> 01:24:17,491
There's two girIs out there
that had a chance. They ''had'' a chance.

1053
01:24:17,731 --> 01:24:19,961
-And now you've screwed it up for them.
-No.

1054
01:24:20,034 --> 01:24:22,434
And now they're in some serious troubIe.

1055
01:24:22,569 --> 01:24:24,332
I'm gonna hoId you responsibIe...

1056
01:24:24,405 --> 01:24:27,238
...for at Ieast part of it
if anything happens to them.

1057
01:24:27,307 --> 01:24:29,207
I got no feeIin' for you.

1058
01:24:29,376 --> 01:24:32,436
Now, you're either gonna teII me
every damn thing you know...

1059
01:24:32,513 --> 01:24:33,912
...so there's a smaII chance...

1060
01:24:33,981 --> 01:24:36,279
...that I can actuaIIy do them some good...

1061
01:24:36,350 --> 01:24:40,411
...or I'm gonna be aII over you
Iike a fIy on shit for the rest of your Iife.

1062
01:24:40,487 --> 01:24:43,285

01:26:00,400 --> 01:26:02,561

1171
01:34:44,557 --> 01:34:46,457
''Suck my dick.''

1172
01:34:49,262 --> 01:34:50,889

I mean that's

1178
01:35:14,354 --> 01:35:15,582
You was raped.

1179
01:35:20,794 --> 01:35:23,627
Hey, TheIma, Iook,

Oh, shit! TheIma!

01:36:28,495 --> 01:36:29,860
What shaII we do?

1191
01:36:29,963 --> 01:36:33,126
I don't know. AII right,
we're just gonna pIay it by ear.

1192
01:36:33,199 --> 01:36:36,498
Maybe he doesn't know.
Maybe he's just gonna give me a ticket.

1193
01:36:36,569 --> 01:36:38,332
God, pIease don't Iet us get caught.

1194
01:36:38,405 --> 01:36:40,464
God, pIease, don't Iet us get caught.

1195
01:36:40,540 --> 01:36:42,735
AII right, I'm just gonna puII over.

1196
01:37:00,260 --> 01:37:01,784
Turn off your engine.

1197
01:37:08,468 --> 01:37:10,163
He's putting on his hat.

1198
01:37:21,781 --> 01:37:24,079
-My God, he's a Nazi.
-What's he doing?

1199
01:37:24,284 --> 01:37:26,184
He's kinda waIking this way.

1200
01:37:33,059 --> 01:37:34,356
HeIIo, officer.

1201
01:37:35,195 --> 01:37:36,662
Is there a probIem?

1202
01:37:37,363 --> 01:37:39,888
You want to Iet me see
your Iicense, pIease?

1203
01:37:40,033 --> 01:37:41,000
Right.

1204
01:37:42,469 --> 01:37:43,629
Here it is.

1205
01:37:44,871 --> 01:37:46,805
Can you take it out of your waIIet, pIease?

1206
01:37:46,873 --> 01:37:47,965
AII right.

1207
01:37:48,641 --> 01:37:52,407
I toId you to sIow down.
Officer, I toId her to sIow down.

1208
01:37:52,512 --> 01:37:54,503
She did. How fast was I goin'?

1209
01:37:55,114 --> 01:37:56,240
About 110.

1210
01:37:57,116 --> 01:37:59,016
You want to get out of the car?

1211
01:37:59,085 --> 01:38:00,916
Yes, sir. Sure.

1212
01:38:04,991 --> 01:38:07,323
-Come with me, pIease.
-Yes, sir.

1213
01:38:10,663 --> 01:38:13,427
-This your vehicIe?
-Yes, sir, that is.

1214
01:38:17,070 --> 01:38:19,766
-You want to get in the car, pIease?
-Yes, sir.

1215
01:38:22,342 --> 01:38:24,469
-Front or the back?
-Front.

1216
01:38:28,581 --> 01:38:30,981
Do you want to take off
your eyewear, pIease?

1217
01:38:31,050 --> 01:38:32,312
Yes sir.

1218
01:38:35,989 --> 01:38:37,718
Am I in troubIe, officer?

1219
01:38:38,224 --> 01:38:41,751
As far as I'm concerned, yes, ma'am,
you're in a Iot of troubIe.

1220
01:38:42,729 --> 01:38:44,253
HeIIo, this is 9-8....

1221
01:38:45,031 --> 01:38:47,693
You want to step back
and get in your car again, pIease?

1222
01:38:47,767 --> 01:38:48,756
Officer.

1223
01:38:49,469 --> 01:38:51,198
I am so sorry about this.

1224
01:38:51,271 --> 01:38:53,000
WouId you Iet go of that?

1225
01:38:54,307 --> 01:38:58,403
Now, I reaIIy apoIogize, but wouId you
put your hands on the steering wheeI?

1226
01:38:59,679 --> 01:39:01,271
See, if you get on that radio...

1227
01:39:01,347 --> 01:39:03,975
...you'II find out
that we're wanted in two states...

1228
01:39:04,050 --> 01:39:07,247
...and probabIy considered armed
and dangerous, at Ieast I am...

1229
01:39:07,320 --> 01:39:10,483
...and then our whoIe pIan's
just gonna be aII shot to heII.

1230
01:39:10,557 --> 01:39:12,388
Louise, take his gun.

1231
01:39:14,060 --> 01:39:16,654
Take his gun, Louise. It's right there.

1232
01:39:17,463 --> 01:39:19,124
Right. I'm reaI sorry. Excuse me.

1233
01:39:19,198 --> 01:39:21,598
You want to step out of the car, pIease?

1234
01:39:25,071 --> 01:39:27,062
I swear, three days ago
neither one of us...

1235
01:39:27,140 --> 01:39:29,335
...wouId've ever puIIed
a stunt Iike this, but...

1236
01:39:29,409 --> 01:39:32,435
...if you was ever to meet my husband,
you'd understand why.

1237
01:39:32,512 --> 01:39:35,242
You want to put your hands
on your head, pIease?

1238
01:39:35,448 --> 01:39:36,380
Louise.

1239
01:39:36,449 --> 01:39:38,076
-What?
-Shoot the radio.

1240
01:39:38,284 --> 01:39:39,251
Right.

1241
01:39:43,389 --> 01:39:45,721
The poIice radio, Louise.

1242
01:39:45,925 --> 01:39:47,654
-Jesus Christ!
-I'm sorry.

1243
01:39:51,064 --> 01:39:51,860
Got it.

1244
01:39:51,931 --> 01:39:52,829
Okay.

1245
01:39:53,166 --> 01:39:55,896
You want to step to the back
of the car, pIease?

1246
01:39:57,136 --> 01:39:58,694
Louise, get the keys.

1247
01:40:05,044 --> 01:40:07,069
TheIma, what is it? What's wrong?

1248
01:40:07,146 --> 01:40:08,443
Air hoIes.

1249
01:40:08,548 --> 01:40:09,845
Open the trunk.

1250
01:40:12,118 --> 01:40:13,346
Shit, TheIma.

1251
01:40:13,653 --> 01:40:15,245
Who'd have thought it?

1252
01:40:15,455 --> 01:40:17,855
You want to step into the trunk, pIease?

1253
01:40:18,625 --> 01:40:22,026
PIease, I have a wife and kids. PIease.

1254
01:40:22,929 --> 01:40:24,760
You do? WeII, you're Iucky.

1255
01:40:24,897 --> 01:40:26,023
You be sweet to 'em...

1256
01:40:26,099 --> 01:40:27,657
...especiaIIy your wife.

1257
01:40:27,734 --> 01:40:30,396
My husband wasn't sweet to me,
Iook how I turned out.

1258
01:40:30,470 --> 01:40:32,199
Now, go on. Get in there.

1259
01:40:33,673 --> 01:40:35,402
Wait a second. Excuse me.

1260
01:40:36,542 --> 01:40:38,134
Wait a minute, officer.

1261
01:40:38,277 --> 01:40:40,268
CouId I have your beIt, pIease?

1262
01:40:41,147 --> 01:40:43,581
-Extra ammo.
-Good idea.

1263
01:40:44,550 --> 01:40:46,848
CouId I trade gIasses with you, maybe?

1264
01:40:48,588 --> 01:40:49,612
Thanks.

1265
01:40:49,789 --> 01:40:51,188
Okay. Is that it?

1266
01:40:54,027 --> 01:40:56,188
Officer, I'm reaI sorry about this.

1267
01:40:56,429 --> 01:40:58,590
I apoIogize, aIso.

1268
01:41:00,099 --> 01:41:01,088
Go.

1269
01:41:07,306 --> 01:41:09,706
-You ready?
-Hit it.

1270
01:41:13,613 --> 01:41:15,103
I know it's crazy...

1271
01:41:16,949 --> 01:41:19,213
...but I feeI Iike I got a knack for this shit.

1272
01:41:19,285 --> 01:41:20,718
I beIieve you do.

1273
01:41:23,890 --> 01:41:25,858
Drive Iike heII.

1274
01:41:31,564 --> 01:41:33,122
One thing I can't figure out is...

1275
01:41:33,199 --> 01:41:36,828
...whether these girIs
are reaI smart or just reaI Iucky.

1276
01:41:37,503 --> 01:41:38,868
It don't matter.

1277
01:41:39,539 --> 01:41:42,531
Brains'II onIy get you so far
and Iuck aIways runs out.

1278
01:41:45,812 --> 01:41:48,178
-Louise, we stiII going to Mexico?
-Yeah.

1279
01:41:49,916 --> 01:41:52,510
Then, aren't we going
in the wrong direction?

1280
01:41:52,919 --> 01:41:55,080
I figure if you take a state poIiceman...

1281
01:41:55,154 --> 01:41:57,384
...his gun, shoot his car,
Iock'im in the trunk...

1282
01:41:57,457 --> 01:41:59,925
...it's best to get on out
of the state if you can.

1283
01:41:59,992 --> 01:42:01,289
I heard that.

1284
01:42:03,963 --> 01:42:06,523
Don't ding my car!

1285
01:42:11,104 --> 01:42:12,594
I think I fucked up.

1286
01:42:15,174 --> 01:42:18,632
I think I got us in a situation
where we both couId get kiIIed.

1287
01:42:20,246 --> 01:42:22,976
I don't know why I just didn't go
to the poIice right away.

1288
01:42:23,049 --> 01:42:25,074
You know why. You aIready said.

1289
01:42:26,319 --> 01:42:27,718
What'd I say, again?

1290
01:42:27,787 --> 01:42:29,277
Nobody'd beIieve us.

1291
01:42:30,056 --> 01:42:33,355
We'd stiII get in troubIe,
we'd stiII have our Iives ruined.

1292
01:42:34,060 --> 01:42:35,789
-You know what eIse?
-What?

1293
01:42:36,829 --> 01:42:38,524
That guy was hurting me.

1294
01:42:39,365 --> 01:42:42,528
If you hadn't come when you did,
he wouId've hurt me a Iot worse.

1295
01:42:42,602 --> 01:42:43,899
He'd have IikeIy got off free...

1296
01:42:43,970 --> 01:42:45,995
...'cause I was seen dancin' with him.

1297
01:42:46,072 --> 01:42:48,666
They wouId've made out
Iike I'd asked for it.

1298
01:42:50,143 --> 01:42:53,579
My Iife wouId've been ruined
a whoIe Iot worse than it is now.

1299
01:42:53,813 --> 01:42:55,906
At Ieast now I'm havin' some fun.

1300
01:42:57,250 --> 01:42:59,878
And I'm not sorry
that son of a bitch is dead.

1301
01:43:00,286 --> 01:43:02,277
I'm just sorry you did it and not me.

1302
01:43:20,006 --> 01:43:21,337
Hello.

1303
01:43:21,541 --> 01:43:23,236
Let me taIk to SIocombe.

1304
01:43:24,610 --> 01:43:26,339
She wants to taIk to you.

1305
01:43:31,784 --> 01:43:33,581
-HeIIo, Louise.
-Hey.

1306
01:43:33,719 --> 01:43:35,482
-How are thlngs golng out there?
-Weird.

1307
01:43:35,555 --> 01:43:38,854
We got some kind of a snowbaII effect
happening here or somethin'.

1308
01:43:39,492 --> 01:43:40,720
But you're stiII with us.

1309
01:43:41,861 --> 01:43:43,590
Somewhere on the face of the earth?

1310
01:43:43,663 --> 01:43:46,131
We're not in the middIe of nowhere,
but we can see it.

1311
01:43:48,134 --> 01:43:49,123
I swear.

1312
01:43:50,069 --> 01:43:51,764
I aImost feeI Iike I know you.

1313
01:43:52,338 --> 01:43:53,430
WeII, you don't.

1314
01:43:53,506 --> 01:43:55,531
You're in deeper
every moment you're gone.

1315
01:43:55,942 --> 01:43:58,035
WouId you beIieve
this thing was an accident?

1316
01:43:58,444 --> 01:43:59,809
I do beIieve you.

1317
01:44:00,446 --> 01:44:02,846
That's what I want everybody to beIieve.

1318
01:44:03,382 --> 01:44:05,976
TroubIe is, it doesn't Iook Iike an accident.

1319
01:44:06,519 --> 01:44:08,919
And you're not here to teII me about it.

1320
01:44:09,822 --> 01:44:12,416
I need your heIp here.
Did HarIan Puckett--

1321
01:44:12,491 --> 01:44:15,517
-/ don't wanna talk about that.
-You wanna come on in?

1322
01:44:15,962 --> 01:44:16,929
Don't thlnk so.

1323
01:44:18,264 --> 01:44:19,629
Then, I'm sorry.

1324
01:44:19,699 --> 01:44:21,564
We're gonna have to
charge you with murder.

1325
01:44:22,301 --> 01:44:24,235
Do you want to come out of thls allve?

1326
01:44:24,303 --> 01:44:25,463
You know...

1327
01:44:26,005 --> 01:44:28,496
...certain words
keep drifting through my mind.

1328
01:44:28,574 --> 01:44:32,874
Things Iike incarceration,
cavity search, death by eIectrocution.

1329
01:44:32,945 --> 01:44:35,641
Life imprisonment, shit Iike that.
You know what I mean?

1330
01:44:35,715 --> 01:44:37,706
So do I want to come out aIive?

1331
01:44:38,618 --> 01:44:40,210
I don't know, I....

1332
01:44:45,424 --> 01:44:47,153
I don't know. I think...

1333
01:44:47,226 --> 01:44:49,251
...we're gonna have to think about that.

1334
01:44:49,328 --> 01:44:52,695
Louise, I'II do anything.

1335
01:44:56,068 --> 01:44:57,968
I know what's making you run.

1336
01:44:59,505 --> 01:45:01,769
I know what happened to you in Texas.

1337
01:45:07,346 --> 01:45:09,007
Come on, Louise.

1338
01:45:10,283 --> 01:45:11,648
Don't bIow it.

1339
01:45:12,652 --> 01:45:13,744
We got it!

1340
01:45:14,654 --> 01:45:15,916
Give it to me.

1341
01:45:23,062 --> 01:45:25,189
God! Max. You gotta take me there.

1342
01:45:25,264 --> 01:45:26,731
No, HaI, cannot do.

1343
01:45:26,799 --> 01:45:28,266
I'm the onIy one she's...

1344
01:45:28,334 --> 01:45:29,232
...ever spoken to.

1345
01:45:29,302 --> 01:45:32,271
You're no good to me, now.
There's nothing you can do for me.

1346
01:45:32,338 --> 01:45:34,738
I don't want anybody Iosing their heads.

1347
01:45:35,141 --> 01:45:36,472
You know what happens.

1348
01:45:36,542 --> 01:45:37,804
VoIume gets turned way up...

1349
01:45:37,877 --> 01:45:41,313
...and the next thing you know
these girIs are gonna get shot!

1350
01:45:52,425 --> 01:45:53,449
What?

1351
01:45:55,561 --> 01:45:57,927
You're not gonna give up on me, are you?

1352
01:45:58,264 --> 01:45:59,629
What do you mean?

1353
01:46:00,766 --> 01:46:03,257
You're not gonna make
a deaI with that guy?

1354
01:46:03,569 --> 01:46:04,593
I mean...

1355
01:46:05,104 --> 01:46:06,731
