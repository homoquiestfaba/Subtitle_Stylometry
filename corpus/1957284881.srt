1
00:02:08,533 --> 00:02:09,833
Very nice, Penny.

2
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:15,200
Come on, Professor, cheer up.

3
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,880
We found some really great pieces.

4
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:19,100
Yes, but not what we came for.

5
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:23,490
I really went out on a limb
with the university this time.

6
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:26,543
I guaranteed them that
we'd finally track it down.

7
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,580
Perhaps they're right.

8
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:32,950
Perhaps the tomb really is a legend,

9
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:34,923
and I am a fool for believing it.

10
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:41,160
But we shall continue with
style, right?

11
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:44,370
Yes, we shall and
we're not finished yet.

12
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:46,443
We have, let's see,
today is the 8th.

13
00:02:47,899 --> 00:02:50,182
The 8th, the 8th,
why does that sound familiar?

14
00:02:50,182 --> 00:02:52,851
Which means we have five
more days left.

15
00:02:52,851 --> 00:02:55,030
Oh my God, it's my son's birthday.

16
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:56,327
I forgot to call him.

17
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:58,913
I am gonna be disowned.

18
00:03:07,764 --> 00:03:08,887
Hello?

19
00:03:08,887 --> 00:03:11,330
Hey Champ, Happy Birthday.

20
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:12,697
What are you up to?

21
00:03:12,697 --> 00:03:14,840
Oh, Dad, I was just
reading this cool book

22
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,259
that Grandpa got me.

23
00:03:16,259 --> 00:03:17,092
Uh huh.

24
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:19,853
How are grandma and grandpa?

25
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:23,327
Oh, great, hey, where are you?

26
00:03:24,172 --> 00:03:25,500
Uh, I'm still at the dig site,

27
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:28,050
but we should be wrapping
things up here pretty soon.

28
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:29,907
Oh, okay.

29
00:03:29,907 --> 00:03:32,060
Hey I got this idea from this book,

30
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:34,080
because when they were
searching for the city of Troy..

31
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,503
Dave, Dave, we have to go,
we have to go right now!

32
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:42,660
Oh, um, okay, uh,
listen Champ, I'm gonna,

33
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,380
I'm gonna have to call you back.

34
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:46,723
Okay, something's come up.

35
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:50,047
Happy Birthday, Buddy.

36
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:07,210
I want crowbars!

37
00:04:46,264 --> 00:04:47,264
Oh my God!

38
00:05:14,008 --> 00:05:14,841
Is it?

39
00:05:24,888 --> 00:05:25,888
Yes it is.

40
00:05:30,488 --> 00:05:31,655
It's Coronado.

41
00:05:33,668 --> 00:05:36,668
Woo hoo!

42
00:05:43,337 --> 00:05:45,793
And that box gives me the creeps.

43
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,383
Looks like a coffin.

44
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,033
What are you talking about now?

45
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:54,910
Does it smell funny to you?

46
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:57,196
You're the one who smells funny.

47
00:05:57,196 --> 00:06:00,920
I'm serious!

48
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,450
What do you think is in there?

49
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:04,890
One body, Count Dracula.

50
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:06,440
Oh very funny, what's it say?

51
00:06:07,722 --> 00:06:08,555
Remains.

52
00:06:09,974 --> 00:06:10,807
Remains?

53
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:12,753
Remains of what?

54
00:06:12,753 --> 00:06:15,570
Remains of my patience,
now come on, give us a hand!

55
00:06:21,038 --> 00:06:23,815
Put that right over here, all right.

56
00:06:23,815 --> 00:06:27,060
(Muttering)

57
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:29,300
You there,
stop right where you are

58
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:30,780
and identify yourself.

59
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:32,410
Hey, hey watch with that thing,
you're blinding me.

60
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:33,940
It's Dr. McAmmon.

61
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:35,150
You expect me
to take your word for it?

62
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:36,553
Let's see some identification.

63
00:06:37,549 --> 00:06:40,030
Look, could you please
get that out of my face?

64
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:42,310
Huh, why don't you show
me some identification?

65
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:43,143
Who are you?

66
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:48,263
Martin Van Leer, Director of Security.

67
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:52,730
Let's see that ID.

68
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:16,160
Sorry about that Sir.

69
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,580
It's my responsibility to
safeguard these valuables.

70
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:21,960
Been at my present position
for six months now, Sir

71
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:24,736
and you've been gone that
whole time, you understand.

72
00:07:24,736 --> 00:07:25,900
Well, I've been, you know,
digging up

73
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:27,560
these valuables for the last
six months,

74
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:30,890
but I suppose I should be
grateful, so no harm done.

75
00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:32,390
How are things going?

76
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:33,531
Everything's under control.

77
00:07:33,531 --> 00:07:36,760
This is the last load
right here, artifacts.

78
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,616
The treasure came in this
morning, it's all secure.

79
00:07:38,616 --> 00:07:39,449
Good.

80
00:07:52,445 --> 00:07:55,028
Put that on the counter please.

81
00:07:56,555 --> 00:07:58,700
Put this crate over here
on the table and open it up

82
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:01,700
for me, I'll be working on that
first thing in the morning.

83
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:02,720
Thank you.

84
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,640
All right,
goodnight Sir and don't worry,

85
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,240
I'll keep an eye on things here.

86
00:08:11,144 --> 00:08:12,609
Bloody hell, that was close.

87
00:08:12,609 --> 00:08:15,410
Yeah, it's taken out the transformer.

88
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:18,583
You guys stay here,
I'll make a search for breakers.

89
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:24,223
Chris, where are you?

90
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,300
Over here.

91
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:30,544
Help me with this crate.

92
00:08:30,544 --> 00:08:33,100
I don't wanna spend all night here.

93
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:33,933
Ready?

94
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:36,370
Lift.

95
00:08:39,578 --> 00:08:40,651
Did you hear that?

96
00:08:40,651 --> 00:08:41,520
What?

97
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,559
Something moved, in the crate!

98
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:46,200
It shifted when we lifted.

99
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:50,075
Now come and help open this
thing up.

100
00:08:51,925 --> 00:08:52,975
I heard it again.

101
00:08:52,975 --> 00:08:54,074
What?

102
00:08:54,074 --> 00:08:56,414
The box, there's something in there.

103
00:08:56,414 --> 00:08:58,581
You're imagining things.

104
00:09:00,724 --> 00:09:03,460
It's probably a rat!

105
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:04,293
A big rat.

106
00:09:08,097 --> 00:09:09,903
C'mon, let's hurry up and
finish this

107
00:09:09,903 --> 00:09:14,203
so we can get the hell out.

108
00:09:14,203 --> 00:09:15,900
You can wrap it up if you want.

109
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:17,613
I'm gonna wait 'til the
lights turn on.

110
00:09:22,312 --> 00:09:24,563
Don't just stand there, push.

111
00:09:31,393 --> 00:09:32,726
See, I told you.

112
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:45,570
Thanks Kid.

113
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:49,383
Charlie, hey!

114
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:53,480
I'm sorry I wasn't able to meet
you, but I had this meeting

115
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,563
and it went late.

116
00:09:54,563 --> 00:09:56,120
It's been crazy around here.

117
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:59,581
So, did you grow two inches,
is that what happened?

118
00:09:59,581 --> 00:10:01,147
You grew like two inches?

119
00:10:01,147 --> 00:10:03,143
I have got a surprise for you.

120
00:10:05,522 --> 00:10:07,830
No, no, no, not that way,
this way.

121
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:08,663
Where are we going?

122
00:10:08,663 --> 00:10:10,260
You'll see.

123
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:11,510
When are we going home?

124
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,593
Well, actually we are home.

125
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,430
This is our new house.

126
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:18,380
New house?

127
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:20,900
It's a gift from the university,
a perk actually.

128
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:23,350
We don't own it, but
we got free use of it.

129
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:26,113
And there's no mortgage
payment and best of all,

130
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:30,170
the lab is so close that
I can come home

131
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:32,270
and have dinner,
even if I'm working late.

132
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,870
But what if we don't like it?

133
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:36,520
Of course we'll like it.

134
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:39,270
Come on in, Charlie, take a look.

135
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:44,540
You moved us already?

136
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:47,583
Yep, that was one headache
you were able to avoid.

137
00:10:49,533 --> 00:10:51,119
I can't believe it.

138
00:10:57,587 --> 00:10:59,199
What about the old house?

139
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:03,077
Well, I'm gonna sell it.

140
00:11:03,077 --> 00:11:04,873
Oh, I almost forgot.

141
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:11,083
I know it's a little late,
but Happy Birthday.

142
00:11:15,288 --> 00:11:16,488
Don't you wanna open it?

143
00:11:18,917 --> 00:11:20,680
I'm sorry I missed your
birthday, Buddy

144
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,763
but, uh, I promise I'm
gonna make it up to you.

145
00:11:25,147 --> 00:11:25,980
All right?

146
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:30,990
So, uh, why don't we go
see your room, come on.

147
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:32,350
I'll show you your room.

148
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:33,350
It's right upstairs.

149
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:38,545
I think you're really gonna
like it.

150
00:11:38,545 --> 00:11:39,585
Look at that map.

151
00:11:39,585 --> 00:11:41,265
Just think, every time
you come up the stairway,

152
00:11:41,265 --> 00:11:43,155
you can look at that map, huh?

153
00:11:43,155 --> 00:11:44,488
Isn't that nice?

154
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,490
Charlie, this is Marta.

155
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:52,340
This is our new maid.

156
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:53,863
And Marta, this is Charlie.

157
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:00,863
Hello Charlie.

158
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:04,173
It's nice to meet you.

159
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:12,014
Well, I have some things to do.

160
00:12:24,113 --> 00:12:27,278
It's all right, what do you think?

161
00:12:27,278 --> 00:12:28,690
We did the best we could.

162
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:31,240
Of course, you can rearrange
it however you'd like.

163
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:36,933
Look, Sam even made it, no problem.

164
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:44,143
Why don't you open the
present, Buddy?

165
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:54,223
Great.

166
00:12:57,482 --> 00:13:00,810
I thought maybe you'd
like to read up on Coronado.

167
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:03,020
All you ever think about is yourself.

168
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:04,640
Did you ever think that
I may not want to move

169
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,240
and leave all my friends behind?

170
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:08,660
You start school in a couple
of weeks

171
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:10,553
and you'll uh, make new friends.

172
00:13:12,983 --> 00:13:15,883
And we can go visit the old
neighborhood anytime you like.

173
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:21,629
You know one of the fascinating
things about Coronado

174
00:13:21,629 --> 00:13:23,323
is the hardships he endured.

175
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:25,670
You know why he did it?

176
00:13:26,549 --> 00:13:28,033
I don't know.

177
00:13:29,319 --> 00:13:30,473
He was crazy?

178
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:37,260
No, he was a stoic who
remained totally focused

179
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:41,103
on his one burning objective, discovery.

180
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,700
And what was the result?

181
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:45,633
He died.

182
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:50,030
He discovered new lands that
no European

183
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:53,190
had ever laid eyes on before
and he went down in history

184
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:56,253
as one of the world's
greatest explorers.

185
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:01,583
I don't care about Coronado.

186
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:04,750
Is the history lesson over?

187
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:07,440
I just thought maybe
you could be a little bit

188
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:11,140
more like Coronado and look
at the move

189
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:13,913
to the new neighborhood as an adventure.

190
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:24,960
I've got a lot of work to do.

191
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:31,590
I'll let you unpack and
make yourself comfortable.

192
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:32,690
You had a long flight.

193
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:37,590
I'm glad you're here, Charlie.

194
00:14:59,957 --> 00:15:01,790
I made you some cookies.

195
00:15:02,623 --> 00:15:03,470
It's chocolate chip.

196
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:06,663
Thanks.

197
00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:14,630
Your father is very happy to
see you.

198
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:16,303
He misses you so much.

199
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:23,710
Nah, all he cares about are
old bones.

200
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:27,080
Mm, he's a very nice man,

201
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:30,373
but I do not like the work he does.

202
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:34,320
What do you mean?

203
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,160
Digging up old bones?

204
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,683
This is not good, Charlie.

205
00:15:39,758 --> 00:15:42,758
The dead should be left undisturbed.

206
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:50,800
This is yours?

207
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:51,633
Yeah.

208
00:16:22,591 --> 00:16:23,424
Dad?

209
00:16:42,373 --> 00:16:43,206
Dad?

210
00:16:46,973 --> 00:16:47,806
Dad?

211
00:16:54,093 --> 00:16:54,926
Dad?

212
00:17:01,182 --> 00:17:02,015
Dad?

213
00:17:22,084 --> 00:17:24,404
Hey, hey, hey, hey Buddy, Buddy,

214
00:17:24,404 --> 00:17:25,320
it's okay, it's all right,
it's okay.

215
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:26,623
It's me, it's me, it's me.

216
00:17:26,623 --> 00:17:27,887
You all right, are you all right?

217
00:17:27,887 --> 00:17:29,520
He was right behind me!

218
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,821
What was right behind you?

219
00:17:30,821 --> 00:17:32,650
He, he was.

220
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:33,483
Who was?

221
00:17:33,483 --> 00:17:34,660
He was, but..

222
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:37,710
Hey, hey, hey, hey, look,
look, there's nothing here.

223
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:38,833
It's just us.

224
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:41,570
This house is haunted.

225
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:43,840
Haunted, don't be silly.

226
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,600
Come on, you just had a nightmare.

227
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,060
It was no nightmare.

228
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:49,960
Oh yeah, well there's nothing here.

229
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:53,260
It's your first night in a
new house,

230
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:55,083
it's dark, there's a storm out.

231
00:17:56,670 --> 00:17:58,480
Come on, it's late.

232
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,684
I've got a big day tomorrow.

233
00:18:00,684 --> 00:18:02,184
Let's get some sleep, come on.

234
00:18:11,033 --> 00:18:11,866
Ah!

235
00:18:16,757 --> 00:18:19,217
Good morning Mr. Dave.

236
00:18:19,217 --> 00:18:20,667
You get a good night's sleep?

237
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,023
I've had better.

238
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:31,320
Ah what you need is a good
hot muffin to get you going.

239
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,930
Oh, those smell delicious Marta,

240
00:18:32,930 --> 00:18:34,410
but I've gotta get to the museum

241
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:36,810
and get ready for this
Press Conference tonight.

242
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:40,260
Your father works so hard.

243
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:41,660
Sometimes he forgets to eat.

244
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,627
I put some in a bag for you.

245
00:18:44,627 --> 00:18:47,660
Hey listen Champ, here's $10,
so listen, if you wanna

246
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:51,240
rent a video or you know,
catch a movie in town or whatever.

247
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,073
Just have fun.

248
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,963
Maybe you should go out today.

249
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:24,093
Explore the neighborhood,
make new friends.

250
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:29,070
I already have friends,
I just can't see them anymore.

251
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:36,039
Mm.

252
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:42,980
Oh no, I was going to
make some more cookies.

253
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:44,033
I have no eggs.

254
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,280
Will you go to the store for me?

255
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:50,263
Sure.

256
00:19:51,812 --> 00:19:54,100
You know where it is?

257
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:55,050
Yeah, I think so.

258
00:20:11,972 --> 00:20:14,653
Hey, hey, if you're not
gonna put any quarters

259
00:20:14,653 --> 00:20:16,893
in the machine, leave it alone.

260
00:20:16,893 --> 00:20:18,893
Hey, I'm talking to you!

261
00:20:20,813 --> 00:20:22,933
Hey, don't hit the machines.

262
00:20:30,223 --> 00:20:31,780
Hey, take over for me.

263
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:33,653
Stay alive or you're dead.

264
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:37,163
Hey Sweet Thing,
change your mind about me yet?

265
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:39,790
Don't hold your breath.

266
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:40,623
Come on.

267
00:20:42,716 --> 00:20:44,065
Excuse me.

268
00:20:44,065 --> 00:20:46,330
How nice, someone with manners.

269
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:48,273
Maybe you could take a lesson.

270
00:20:48,273 --> 00:20:51,550
I'd like to give you a lesson
in love.

271
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:53,787
One night with me and
you'll forget your own name.

272
00:20:53,787 --> 00:20:55,287
I wish I could forget yours.

273
00:20:56,315 --> 00:20:58,148
Excuse me.

274
00:20:59,770 --> 00:21:02,644
Hi, I'm Nicki.

275
00:21:02,644 --> 00:21:04,653
Hi, I'm Charlie.

276
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:06,500
You must be new around here.

277
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:07,800
I haven't seen you before.

278
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:12,333
Yeah, my dad works at the university.

279
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:26,840
Egg Inspector.

280
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,612
Egg head is more like it.

281
00:21:28,612 --> 00:21:32,514
Hey, how about a good game of
egg ball?

282
00:21:32,514 --> 00:21:34,847
I guess you are the catcher.

283
00:21:37,162 --> 00:21:39,120
I can be the batter,
'cause I'm gonna knock one

284
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,323
of your eggs over that wall
right there.

285
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:45,136
All right.

286
00:21:48,879 --> 00:21:51,200
Yeah, here we go, here we go.

287
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,250
Nah, bad pitch,
gimme a better pitch.

288
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:55,020
All right, go ahead and gimme one.

289
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:56,570
Hey batter, batter!

290
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,877
Look alive, Catcher!

291
00:22:00,877 --> 00:22:03,627
(Muttering)

292
00:22:07,045 --> 00:22:11,595
Whoa!

293
00:22:13,286 --> 00:22:16,236
Looks like I have to have a
little talk with the catcher.

294
00:22:21,181 --> 00:22:23,540
You did that on purpose
didn't you, you little creep.

295
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:25,200
Do you know how much these
boots cost?

296
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,240
Let him go, Mitch, you're lucky

297
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,060
he didn't hit you in the face.

298
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:29,670
It's his face that something's
going to happen to.

299
00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:31,160
You kids,
no fighting around my store!

300
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,453
Go on, get outta here!

301
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:34,970
We're just joking around.

302
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:38,970
You got off easy this time,
but next time

303
00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:41,113
I'm gonna make you lick my
boots clean.

304
00:22:47,693 --> 00:22:49,853
See you later, Charlie.

305
00:22:49,853 --> 00:22:52,853
Yeah, I guess I'll see you around.

306
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,820
Careful study has revealed
that he was a visionary

307
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:05,403
explorer and a dignified
military leader,

308
00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:10,120
reserved, thoughtful, level headed.

309
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:12,590
These are all words that
would accurately

310
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:15,173
the stoic and fearless leader.

311
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,040
Coronado dedicated his life

312
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:20,310
towards the preeminent objective,

313
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:22,913
pushing the boundaries of exploration,

314
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:28,893
but the Queen demanded that
Coronado bring back the gold.

315
00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:33,340
Being a man of duty,
he did as he was told,

316
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:35,973
even though it ultimately
led to his death.

317
00:23:53,284 --> 00:23:54,617
Charlie.

318
00:24:04,631 --> 00:24:05,464
Charlie.

319
00:24:12,745 --> 00:24:17,745
Charlie.

320
00:24:23,365 --> 00:24:24,198
Charlie!

321
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:38,540
Until now, the death of
Coronado has been the stuff

322
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:41,540
of legend and speculation.

323
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:45,675
No one had ever been able
to locate his fabled tomb.

324
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:50,340
But this summer, after
years of exhaustive research

325
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:55,713
and excavation,
my team and I finally did it.

326
00:24:58,190 --> 00:25:01,230
And we were able to substantiate

327
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:03,550
the legend of Coronado's death.

328
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:04,970
Penny?

329
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:07,383
Ladies and Gentlemen, Coronado.

330
00:25:44,548 --> 00:25:47,600
Oh, just wait a minute,
where do you think you're going?

331
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:48,830
My father's in there.

332
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:49,850
I need to talk to him.

333
00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:51,200
I'm not gonna interrupt this

334
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,820
just because some kid
has his undies in a wad.

335
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:55,540
Now take a powder!

336
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:57,740
As he was buried alive (muttering).

337
00:26:04,708 --> 00:26:07,573
I'm not afraid, no, I'm not afraid.

338
00:26:09,010 --> 00:26:12,315
Nope, I'm not afraid, not afraid
'cause ghosts aren't real.

339
00:26:12,315 --> 00:26:14,656
I don't believe in ghosts.

340
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:17,847
I'm not afraid.. I'm not afraid.

341
00:26:17,847 --> 00:26:18,797
No, I'm not afraid.

342
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:27,223
Hola Charlie.

343
00:26:28,961 --> 00:26:29,813
Dad!

344
00:26:29,813 --> 00:26:30,980
Dad, Dad, Dad!

345
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:35,193
Hey Dad, Dad!

346
00:26:36,485 --> 00:26:37,318
Dad!

347
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:40,182
I told you to stay outta here, Kid.

348
00:26:40,182 --> 00:26:42,870
Martin, Martin, it's okay,
that's my son.

349
00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:43,703
Excuse me.

350
00:26:43,703 --> 00:26:44,550
Yes, Sir.

351
00:26:46,910 --> 00:26:47,743
Hey, hey,
Dad!

352
00:26:47,743 --> 00:26:48,680
Charlie, Charlie, are you okay?

353
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:50,210
Yeah, Dad, he was after me!

354
00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:51,043
Who was after you?

355
00:26:51,043 --> 00:26:52,520
The ghost, he was here.

356
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:53,900
Get ahold of yourself.

357
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:55,540
But Dad he was..

358
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:58,420
Listen, listen,
I was just giving a speech

359
00:26:58,420 --> 00:26:59,820
telling these people about a man

360
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:02,110
who knew the meaning
of respect and dignity.

361
00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:05,020
Now, I'd appreciate it if
you'd do a little of the same.

362
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:05,853
But Dad, he..

363
00:27:05,853 --> 00:27:06,686
I don't want to hear it.

364
00:27:06,686 --> 00:27:08,693
I want you to go stand over there

365
00:27:08,693 --> 00:27:11,903
and not another word, go on.

366
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,200
Sorry Folks,
just a little family drama.

367
00:28:04,670 --> 00:28:06,470
A disgrace, don't you think?

368
00:28:08,690 --> 00:28:11,960
Look at it,
the bones of the dead hauled up

369
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,893
and staked up for public display.

370
00:28:15,410 --> 00:28:17,280
Don't run away again.

371
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,060
I didn't come back from the
nether regions

372
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:20,520
just to harm a small boy.

373
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:25,520
But, who, who are you?

374
00:28:25,610 --> 00:28:28,803
I am he who used to be the
man whose bones those were.

375
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:33,410
Come Boy,
surely you have guessed by now.

376
00:28:33,410 --> 00:28:37,980
It is I,
Frederico Cavrell Disposa De Coronado

377
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:39,840
Commander of the Queen's Guard

378
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:44,527
and ruler of New Spain and a
General, all around nice guy.

379
00:28:46,148 --> 00:28:49,433
Unless of course, you are
standing in between me and gold.

380
00:28:54,777 --> 00:28:57,337
Oh, oro, beautiful gold.

381
00:29:00,167 --> 00:29:03,480
And to think how close
I was to claiming it.

382
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,213
Those nasty Mayans tricked me.

383
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:08,570
But wasn't it their gold to
begin with?

384
00:29:09,436 --> 00:29:11,486
A minor point, Muchacho, a minor point.

385
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:18,210
Besides, I didn't want all of
it, just most of it.

386
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:25,250
Wait, I, I don't understand
how and why are you here?

387
00:29:27,930 --> 00:29:31,193
Because of this, this outrage!

388
00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:35,950
This public humiliation!

389
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:37,543
What are you talking about?

390
00:29:37,543 --> 00:29:40,400
My bones, Muchacho, my bones!

391
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:43,423
Just thrown here in a heap for
the whole world to gawk at!

392
00:29:43,423 --> 00:29:45,140
It's a mockery!

393
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:47,340
It's a museum exhibit.

394
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:48,250
If you don't like it,

395
00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:51,253
just fly off to Ghost Land or something.

396
00:29:56,415 --> 00:29:58,995
I need your help, Muchacho.

397
00:29:58,995 --> 00:30:00,774
What?

398
00:30:00,774 --> 00:30:02,070
Why?

399
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:05,690
Well, the Mayans, when they
sealed me into that chamber,

400
00:30:05,690 --> 00:30:10,690
they denied me a proper burial,
trapping me in limbo,

401
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:14,530
a never land between
this world and the next.

402
00:30:14,530 --> 00:30:18,065
And now, your father
has done the same thing.

403
00:30:18,065 --> 00:30:19,143
Limbo?

404
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:21,633
I don't get it.

405
00:30:24,777 --> 00:30:27,173
Don't you know anything about ghosts?

406
00:30:32,890 --> 00:30:35,970
I need you to take my bones
and bury them

407
00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:39,383
on hallowed ground,
so I can go to my final rest.

408
00:30:42,792 --> 00:30:46,875
Wait, wait a minute, hallowed ground?

409
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,170
You've got to be kidding.

410
00:30:55,170 --> 00:30:57,770
I wish, this is not just.

411
00:30:57,770 --> 00:31:01,170
I want you to take my
bones from this glass tomb

412
00:31:01,170 --> 00:31:04,460
and bury them in a proper cemetery.

413
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:05,450
You mean steal, don't you?

414
00:31:05,450 --> 00:31:07,533
You want me to steal my
father's exhibit?

415
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:10,650
Father's exhibit?

416
00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:12,193
These are my bones!

417
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:14,523
They belong to me!

418
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,380
Well, you're crazy if
you think I'm gonna steal.

419
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:19,202
My father would kill me.

420
00:31:19,202 --> 00:31:20,140
Well then perhaps he would pay

421
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:22,260
some attention to you, Boy.

422
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:23,800
Hey, who asked you?

423
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,941
My father treats me just fine.

424
00:31:25,941 --> 00:31:27,191
Mm, harrumph.

425
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,920
All right,
now hold it right there, Bub.

426
00:31:32,770 --> 00:31:34,440
What are you doing?

427
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:36,287
I, uh..

428
00:31:36,287 --> 00:31:38,089
And who are you talking to?

429
00:31:38,089 --> 00:31:40,089
What do you mean, him!

430
00:31:43,170 --> 00:31:45,113
Have you no manners, Swine?

431
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:48,750
I knew you were trouble the
minute I laid eyes on you.

432
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:50,630
Don't you think for a second
that just because your dad

433
00:31:50,630 --> 00:31:52,160
is some big deal professor
that you're gonna

434
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,860
get any special treatment
from me.

435
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:56,770
Now, who were you talking to?

436
00:31:56,770 --> 00:31:58,833
I told you that,

437
00:32:01,553 --> 00:32:02,800
that there's nobody.

438
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,263
I'm just talking to myself.

439
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:09,820
What, do I look like
I was born in a barn?

440
00:32:10,723 --> 00:32:13,880
Well, now that you mention it.

441
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,733
Let's go, come on!

442
00:32:18,075 --> 00:32:18,908
Come on!

443
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:24,093
See this here?

444
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:28,980
This is the very latest security
system on the market today.

445
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:32,480
Once I activate it, anyone
or anything that moves

446
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:34,513
inside the exhibit hall will
be trapped.

447
00:32:35,631 --> 00:32:39,313
Now, sure you don't
wanna change your story?

448
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:44,040
Ay dios mios, this
one sure can talk, huh?

449
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:45,710
Did you hear me son?

450
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:48,403
No, no, I mean, uh,
there's nobody in there.

451
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:54,310
Okay, this room is now impregnable

452
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:58,140
and it takes two keys
to activate the system.

453
00:32:58,140 --> 00:32:59,710
Now your father has one key
and the Dean, of course,

454
00:32:59,710 --> 00:33:01,610
has the other one,
but I'm the only person

455
00:33:01,610 --> 00:33:04,093
that's been entrusted to have
both keys.

456
00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:07,940
And these keys never leave my sight.

457
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:11,402
As a matter of fact,
I never even take them off.

458
00:33:11,402 --> 00:33:12,720
(Murmurs)

459
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,541
Now I should warn you,

460
00:33:14,541 --> 00:33:16,050
that no one
No one.

461
00:33:16,050 --> 00:33:16,883
Has ever broken
No one.

462
00:33:16,883 --> 00:33:20,490
Into this museum, ever and no
one ever will, you know why?

463
00:33:20,490 --> 00:33:23,887
Because I will never drop my
guard, ever.

464
00:33:23,887 --> 00:33:24,720
Oh!

465
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:28,320
I don't know what your
game is Son, but uh,

466
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:32,050
I should warn you, I'm gonna
be keeping my eyes on you.

467
00:33:41,354 --> 00:33:43,354
Let's get out of here.

468
00:33:48,944 --> 00:33:51,200
It's probably my fault,
leaving you alone

469
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:54,040
in this big house, but
you're a big boy now Charlie.

470
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:56,670
I need to be able to rely on you.

471
00:33:56,670 --> 00:33:57,620
I know.

472
00:33:59,392 --> 00:34:02,503
All right, no real harm done.

473
00:34:03,514 --> 00:34:05,414
Why don't you go on and get
some sleep

474
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:10,103
and absolutely no more of
this ghost nonsense, okay?

475
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:12,810
Okay.
All right.

476
00:34:27,805 --> 00:34:30,280
(Foreign language)

477
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:31,810
Don't do that!

478
00:34:31,810 --> 00:34:33,250
What took you so long?

479
00:34:33,250 --> 00:34:34,450
You move slow as a mule.

480
00:34:35,982 --> 00:34:38,470
I'm sorry, I haven't exactly mastered

481
00:34:38,470 --> 00:34:40,301
the art of teleporting yet.

482
00:34:40,301 --> 00:34:41,134
Que?

483
00:34:43,027 --> 00:34:43,943
Nevermind.

484
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:51,920
By the way, thanks for
getting me in trouble.

485
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:54,670
Well it is your fault,
you shouldn't raise your voice

486
00:34:54,670 --> 00:34:57,290
when speaking to ghosts.

487
00:34:57,290 --> 00:34:59,020
Yeah, that's another thing.

488
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:01,170
Why am I the only one that
can see you?

489
00:35:01,170 --> 00:35:04,390
Because it is you who I have
chosen to help me, Charlie.

490
00:35:04,390 --> 00:35:06,983
But why me, I'm just a kid.

491
00:35:08,350 --> 00:35:09,703
Size is not important.

492
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:13,643
It's the will to do
the thing that matters.

493
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:17,520
Didn't anybody ever tell you
the story of David and Goliath?

494
00:35:19,170 --> 00:35:21,717
You can tell me all the
stories you would like,

495
00:35:21,717 --> 00:35:24,293
but I am not going to steal
your bones.

496
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:29,200
Then you give me no choice,

497
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:32,310
but to mercilessly haunt
you until you relent!

498
00:35:32,310 --> 00:35:36,613
Go ahead, you don't scare
me anymore, haunt away!

499
00:35:38,072 --> 00:35:39,323
But I am going to sleep.

500
00:35:42,953 --> 00:35:43,786
Hmm.

501
00:35:47,088 --> 00:35:47,921
From the most beautiful place
in the world,

502
00:35:47,921 --> 00:35:49,620
What are you doing?

503
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:51,280
Such an interesting machine

504
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:53,880
Tanning products in the world..

505
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:56,410
Much has changed in four centuries.

506
00:35:56,410 --> 00:35:59,580
Natural oils, tropical fruits, floral..

507
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:01,163
Hombre, an angel!

508
00:36:03,578 --> 00:36:05,212
Sun care line..

509
00:36:05,212 --> 00:36:10,212
Ah senorita, muy bonita,
come to me my beautiful!

510
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:13,960
I've killed her!

511
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:14,943
Where did she go?

512
00:36:16,873 --> 00:36:19,810
Foolish machine,
it brings lust for women

513
00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:22,120
on their promises they can't keep?

514
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:24,260
What kind of torment is this?

515
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:25,560
It's called advertising.

516
00:36:32,050 --> 00:36:33,370
Charlie, it's a little late
for TV.

517
00:36:33,370 --> 00:36:36,643
Oh, yeah Dad, I'm sorry,
it was just an accident.

518
00:36:48,198 --> 00:36:50,820
I seem to have an interesting effect

519
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:53,680
on your machine!

520
00:36:55,063 --> 00:36:57,396
Charlie, that's not funny.

521
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:01,883
Sorry, Dad, must be broken.

522
00:37:12,910 --> 00:37:15,750
Perhaps you would like to
hear about my real triumphs,

523
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:19,620
like the time I wooed the
Countess of Segovia.

524
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:21,530
Her father told me if he
ever found me near her,

525
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:23,757
he would kill me,
but did that stop me?

526
00:37:23,757 --> 00:37:28,517
Ha, no, when it came to women
or gold, I was fearless.

527
00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:32,380
Well enough, one night I was
trying to sneak into the castle

528
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:34,280
which was a very dangerous proposition,

529
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:37,217
because at every entrance
there were fierce attack dogs,

530
00:37:37,217 --> 00:37:38,147
chihuahua's I think they were,

531
00:37:38,147 --> 00:37:41,550
which is not a bad dog if
you marinate them properly.

532
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:45,027
Anyways, it was dark,
maybe it was light.

533
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:56,610
Ah, breakfast, there is no
finer time in military camp,

534
00:37:56,610 --> 00:37:57,443
Charlie, than breakfast.

535
00:37:57,443 --> 00:37:59,200
It used to be my favorite
time of day.

536
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:02,632
Good morning, how'd you sleep?

537
00:38:02,632 --> 00:38:06,480
Mm, like the dead.

538
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:07,363
Lousy.

539
00:38:08,730 --> 00:38:11,230
Why's that,
there weren't any ghosts were there?

540
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:17,423
No, Dad you're right,
there are no ghosts here.

541
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:21,090
None worth listening to anyway.

542
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:22,760
I resent that.

543
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:25,160
Well, maybe you can
take a nap this afternoon.

544
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:35,120
Ay dios mios, Charlie,
you didn't tell me

545
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:36,380
there were women in camp.

546
00:38:37,634 --> 00:38:39,801
Hola Senorita, muy bonita.

547
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:43,794
Who's ready for breakfast?

548
00:38:43,794 --> 00:38:45,370
I am.

549
00:38:45,370 --> 00:38:49,710
Me too and you, Senorita,
could be my main course.

550
00:38:49,710 --> 00:38:51,240
Enjoy.

551
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:52,773
That looks delicious, Marta.

552
00:38:54,833 --> 00:38:58,233
Oh, it is you who looks
delicious, Senorita.

553
00:38:58,233 --> 00:38:59,863
I could devour you whole.

554
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:06,410
This is the curse of
being a ghost, Muchacho,

555
00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:10,433
to have the appetite but
not be able to participate.

556
00:39:17,010 --> 00:39:18,523
Don't be such a jerk.

557
00:39:19,763 --> 00:39:20,943
What'd you say, Son?

558
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:25,480
What time do you have to go
to work?

559
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:27,913
In a few minutes,
now, eat your breakfast.

560
00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:30,810
Yes, eat up, Boy,
you'll need your strength

561
00:39:30,810 --> 00:39:32,710
if you're going to bury my bones.

562
00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:33,583
Fat chance.

563
00:39:35,030 --> 00:39:35,863
What?

564
00:39:38,370 --> 00:39:41,043
Last chance for orange juice,
want some?

565
00:39:49,010 --> 00:39:50,632
Charlie!

566
00:39:50,632 --> 00:39:52,299
I didn't touch it.

567
00:40:07,234 --> 00:40:08,484
Don't, stop it.

568
00:40:12,281 --> 00:40:13,901
Charlie, what are you doing?

569
00:40:13,901 --> 00:40:14,984
It's stuck.

570
00:40:19,222 --> 00:40:20,055
Please go!

571
00:40:21,392 --> 00:40:22,225
What?

572
00:40:23,531 --> 00:40:25,251
I wasn't talking to you.

573
00:40:25,251 --> 00:40:27,430
If I knew life here was
going to be this much fun,

574
00:40:27,430 --> 00:40:30,611
I would have done it
centuries ago!

575
00:40:30,611 --> 00:40:32,542
You okay?
I'm fine, I'm fine.

576
00:40:32,542 --> 00:40:33,621
Go sit down.

577
00:40:54,450 --> 00:40:56,882
Damn it, Charlie!

578
00:40:56,882 --> 00:40:57,913
I didn't do it!

579
00:40:59,693 --> 00:41:01,070
What the hell's gotten into you?

580
00:41:01,070 --> 00:41:03,700
Charlie, that's it, okay,
I've had enough

581
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:06,450
of these childish pranks, okay.

582
00:41:06,450 --> 00:41:07,700
I have to go to work now.

583
00:41:11,263 --> 00:41:12,577
That man needs to relax.

584
00:41:12,577 --> 00:41:16,300
It is not good for the digestion
to eat and run like that.

585
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:18,840
I do not think it's so funny, Charlie.

586
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:20,970
I didn't do it, it wasn't me.

587
00:41:20,970 --> 00:41:22,660
Yes, well maybe you should go outside

588
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:24,750
before you get into more trouble.

589
00:41:24,750 --> 00:41:25,583
Go.

590
00:41:26,775 --> 00:41:29,043
Aw, don't worry,
I believe you, Charlie.

591
00:41:30,130 --> 00:41:31,340
Shut up!

592
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:32,173
Charlie!

593
00:41:33,565 --> 00:41:35,420
I'm sorry, I didn't mean it.

594
00:41:42,210 --> 00:41:46,540
Why can't you just find
somebody else to haunt, okay?

595
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:48,010
Well just bury my bones

596
00:41:48,010 --> 00:41:50,560
and I will leave you in peace, Amigo.

597
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:52,663
That's that new kid I was
telling you about.

598
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:55,810
And I'm not your amigo.

599
00:41:58,348 --> 00:41:59,730
He seems kinda weird.

600
00:41:59,730 --> 00:42:02,390
Oh no, please, please be my amigo.

601
00:42:02,390 --> 00:42:04,390
Please, please, please,
please, please.

602
00:42:04,390 --> 00:42:07,933
Yeah, but he's kinda cute.

603
00:42:09,796 --> 00:42:11,409
No!

604
00:42:11,409 --> 00:42:12,359
Now leave me alone.

605
00:42:13,570 --> 00:42:15,143
Hey Charlie, Charlie!

606
00:42:17,369 --> 00:42:19,110
Hey Charlie, you're the sly one,

607
00:42:19,110 --> 00:42:23,010
making good with the senoritas
already, huh?

608
00:42:24,620 --> 00:42:25,470
How's it going?

609
00:42:27,550 --> 00:42:30,233
Great, I was just taking a walk.

610
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:33,920
This is my friend, Terri.

611
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:34,753
Hi.

612
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:36,553
Hello Charlie.

613
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:39,810
Do you always talk to yourself?

614
00:42:40,690 --> 00:42:43,853
No, I was rehearsing a play.

615
00:42:44,830 --> 00:42:46,180
Really?

616
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:47,330
Which one?

617
00:42:47,330 --> 00:42:48,910
The Stupid Ghost.

618
00:42:48,910 --> 00:42:50,620
Is it a comedy?

619
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:52,053
More like a horror story.

620
00:42:53,472 --> 00:42:56,930
Oh, you really know
how to hurt a ghost, oh.

621
00:42:56,930 --> 00:42:58,440
Look Charlie,
I'm having a pool party

622
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:00,740
tomorrow afternoon at two o'clock.

623
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:02,890
I thought maybe you'd like to come.

624
00:43:02,890 --> 00:43:05,970
Tomorrow at two, I'd love to.

625
00:43:05,970 --> 00:43:07,833
You're not invited, Birdbrain.

626
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:15,290
Excuse me,
we're playing a game here.

627
00:43:16,529 --> 00:43:19,079
It's a public court, you know,
we could play too.

628
00:43:21,278 --> 00:43:23,550
What's the score, 30 Love?

629
00:43:23,550 --> 00:43:24,950
I believe it was love.

630
00:43:28,490 --> 00:43:29,323
Ow!

631
00:43:38,587 --> 00:43:40,689
Are you okay?

632
00:43:40,689 --> 00:43:42,230
You think you're so smart.

633
00:43:42,230 --> 00:43:44,190
You don't look so smart now,
do you?

634
00:43:44,190 --> 00:43:45,318
Let go of me.

635
00:43:45,318 --> 00:43:48,180
Senorita's in distress,
do something to help her Charlie.

636
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:49,730
But that guy will kill me.

637
00:43:49,730 --> 00:43:51,923
Stop him, tell him to unhand her.

638
00:43:52,861 --> 00:43:54,083
Unhand her!

639
00:43:55,621 --> 00:43:56,740
Unhand her?

640
00:43:56,740 --> 00:44:00,307
Who do you think you are,
the Scarlet Pimpernel?

641
00:44:00,307 --> 00:44:01,683
What do I do now?

642
00:44:01,683 --> 00:44:03,283
Who are you talking to, Creep?

643
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:11,461
When I get through with you,
they're gonna have

644
00:44:11,461 --> 00:44:13,410
to scrape you off this
court with a shovel.

645
00:44:13,410 --> 00:44:14,873
Hey, what are you doing?

646
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:18,680
You wanna fight, you go outside!

647
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:21,133
Go on, get out,
before I call the police.

648
00:44:22,010 --> 00:44:24,180
We'll finish this
tomorrow at the pool party.

649
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:26,120
Be there or I'll come looking
for you.

650
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:27,420
Don't you have ears?

651
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:28,633
You're not invited.

652
00:44:36,150 --> 00:44:37,760
Thanks Charlie.

653
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:40,388
Don't worry, he's just a big jerk.

654
00:44:40,388 --> 00:44:42,220
We'll have fun tomorrow.

655
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:43,270
Hope you'll be there.

656
00:45:13,421 --> 00:45:15,103
Ahem.

657
00:45:15,103 --> 00:45:18,140
Ah, hey Charlie,
didn't see you standing there.

658
00:45:18,140 --> 00:45:21,859
Hey Dad,
hey I gotta ask you a question.

659
00:45:21,859 --> 00:45:25,313
Uh huh, go ahead.

660
00:45:26,490 --> 00:45:28,702
Well you see, it's about
this guy named Mitch Tuggle.

661
00:45:29,807 --> 00:45:31,953
Oh, oh, yup?

662
00:45:32,910 --> 00:45:35,580
Professor, the reporter from
The Times is here.

663
00:45:35,580 --> 00:45:38,340
Oh, oh, right, right,
right, right, right, right.

664
00:45:38,340 --> 00:45:40,003
T-tell 'em I'll be right out.

665
00:45:41,540 --> 00:45:43,540
Listen Buddy,
can this wait 'til tonight?

666
00:45:43,540 --> 00:45:45,420
Yeah, I guess.

667
00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:47,600
Oh no, no, no, not tonight.

668
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:49,830
Tonight I gotta do that
special lecture

669
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:51,350
and then there's a meeting
right after.

670
00:45:51,350 --> 00:45:56,350
Um, tell you what, if you
can hang on until tomorrow,

671
00:45:56,350 --> 00:45:58,750
I'll set aside some time and
we can talk

672
00:45:58,750 --> 00:46:01,990
about whatever it is that you
want, okay?

673
00:46:01,990 --> 00:46:02,823
Tomorrow.

674
00:46:04,950 --> 00:46:07,093
Yeah, tomorrow night then?

675
00:46:08,220 --> 00:46:09,571
I look okay?

676
00:46:09,571 --> 00:46:10,751
Yeah, you look great.

677
00:46:10,751 --> 00:46:13,251
Okay, all right, bye.

678
00:46:16,757 --> 00:46:19,743
Great, tomorrow,
I'll be dead by then.

679
00:46:21,181 --> 00:46:22,793
You're frightened, aren't you Charlie?

680
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:26,210
No.

681
00:46:26,210 --> 00:46:27,890
It's only natural.

682
00:46:27,890 --> 00:46:30,830
In my expeditions,
I was constantly afraid.

683
00:46:30,830 --> 00:46:32,660
But aren't you the
guy that went fearlessly

684
00:46:32,660 --> 00:46:35,744
to his death saying that he'd
protect the Queen's gold?

685
00:46:35,744 --> 00:46:38,443
Complete rubbish!

686
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:42,650
I mean it was true, I was
sealed alive in a Mayan chamber,

687
00:46:42,650 --> 00:46:45,743
but I never said any of those things.

688
00:46:47,686 --> 00:46:49,780
Then what did you say?

689
00:46:49,780 --> 00:46:52,233
If I remember correctly,
it was something like,

690
00:46:53,243 --> 00:46:55,990
(Foreign language).

691
00:46:55,990 --> 00:46:57,063
Oh, to translate,

692
00:47:00,827 --> 00:47:05,536
help, get me out of here!

693
00:47:05,536 --> 00:47:07,286
So you were afraid.

694
00:47:09,707 --> 00:47:13,597
Of course I was,
only an idiot wouldn't be.

695
00:47:13,597 --> 00:47:15,530
There is nothing wrong
with being afraid, Charlie,

696
00:47:15,530 --> 00:47:17,873
but a man must not be ruled
by fear.

697
00:47:18,820 --> 00:47:21,588
You cannot run away from
your problems, Muchacho.

698
00:47:21,588 --> 00:47:22,860
So you're saying I should
fight Tuggle?

699
00:47:22,860 --> 00:47:25,070
Only as the last resort.

700
00:47:25,070 --> 00:47:28,343
Fighting is a stupid way
to solve your differences.

701
00:47:28,343 --> 00:47:32,286
Diplomacy should always
be the first tactic.

702
00:47:32,286 --> 00:47:34,127
I don't think this
guy's the talking type.

703
00:47:34,127 --> 00:47:36,670
Well the battle is not always won

704
00:47:36,670 --> 00:47:38,083
by the mightier opponent.

705
00:47:43,250 --> 00:47:45,137
So what should I do?

706
00:47:45,137 --> 00:47:46,720
Andale, Muchacho.

707
00:47:48,630 --> 00:47:51,730
The first rule is to lure your
enemy onto a battleground

708
00:47:51,730 --> 00:47:55,417
of your choosing, one that
you've had time to prepare, mm.

709
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:57,983
This looks perfect.

710
00:48:07,809 --> 00:48:08,642
Come.

711
00:48:24,580 --> 00:48:27,130
Look Mitch, you and
your Neanderthal friends

712
00:48:27,130 --> 00:48:29,530
are not invited, just get lost.

713
00:48:29,530 --> 00:48:32,350
Look, I'm not here for
sucky little pool party.

714
00:48:32,350 --> 00:48:34,160
I'm waiting for your
little wimp of a friend

715
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:36,120
to respond to my invitation.

716
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:37,363
Hey, knock it off!

717
00:48:38,470 --> 00:48:40,360
And what a surprise,
it doesn't look

718
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:42,440
like he's gonna show either.

719
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:44,573
It doesn't look like who's
gonna show?

720
00:48:48,146 --> 00:48:50,120
Well, well, well,
if it isn't the return

721
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:51,500
of the Scarlet Pumpernickel.

722
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:52,900
I like it when a guy's nice
enough to show

723
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:54,140
up for his own funereal.

724
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:57,078
Hey look Tuggle,
I have no reason to fight you.

725
00:48:57,078 --> 00:48:59,468
Is that so, well see,
I've got a reason.

726
00:48:59,468 --> 00:49:01,390
I don't like the look of your
ugly face

727
00:49:01,390 --> 00:49:03,180
and I plan to rearrange it.

728
00:49:03,180 --> 00:49:06,003
Well you have to catch me first,
Fart Breath.

729
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,097
Look everybody, he's friggin' coward.

730
00:49:12,268 --> 00:49:13,768
Come on.

731
00:49:15,287 --> 00:49:16,500
What is this?

732
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:17,333
Let's go!

733
00:49:20,195 --> 00:49:21,557
Hey, what's going on?

734
00:49:44,216 --> 00:49:45,383
Hola Amigos!

735
00:49:49,077 --> 00:49:50,160
Go get him!

736
00:50:02,556 --> 00:50:04,254
Hey, hey, what's going on?

737
00:50:04,254 --> 00:50:05,145
Let us out.

738
00:50:05,145 --> 00:50:08,576
Yeah, we were just teasing,
let us out.

739
00:50:08,576 --> 00:50:10,776
Don't you just think
we can talk this out?

740
00:50:12,620 --> 00:50:13,453
Okay.

741
00:50:15,561 --> 00:50:17,644
Hey, what's that?

742
00:50:23,673 --> 00:50:25,693
All right, so you wanna talk.

743
00:50:28,898 --> 00:50:31,648
You know, talking is really good.

744
00:50:32,598 --> 00:50:34,181
Charlie look out!

745
00:50:43,470 --> 00:50:44,749
What do I do now?

746
00:50:44,749 --> 00:50:47,040
I don't know,
I guess you have to fight him!

747
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:49,123
Who are you talking to?

748
00:50:58,869 --> 00:51:02,377
(Foreign language)

749
00:51:02,377 --> 00:51:03,469
Ai, yi, yi!

750
00:51:03,469 --> 00:51:05,219
I'm gonna kill you.

751
00:51:06,798 --> 00:51:08,320
Bueno!

752
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:09,237
Ai, yi, yi!

753
00:51:15,071 --> 00:51:16,488
Yes!

754
00:51:24,690 --> 00:51:25,642
Ai, ai, ai ya!

755
00:51:25,642 --> 00:51:29,613
Hey, hey look,
I'm really sorry about this.

756
00:51:29,613 --> 00:51:30,863
I mean..
Yah!

757
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:34,020
Let's just calm down,
I mean we can,

758
00:51:34,020 --> 00:51:34,977
we can work everything out.

759
00:51:34,977 --> 00:51:37,623
Come on, just,
just work things out.

760
00:51:39,230 --> 00:51:43,309
Finito, Muchacho.

761
00:51:47,492 --> 00:51:50,641
Magnifico Muchacho, you did it.

762
00:51:50,641 --> 00:51:52,462
And leave Nicki alone.

763
00:52:02,270 --> 00:52:05,331
Dad, you won't believe it!

764
00:52:05,331 --> 00:52:08,310
I could hardly believe it myself!

765
00:52:08,310 --> 00:52:10,843
Hiya Charlie, look I'm sorry,
I'm in a big hurry.

766
00:52:22,340 --> 00:52:23,390
What happened to you?

767
00:52:24,357 --> 00:52:26,067
Go on, tell him boy.

768
00:52:26,067 --> 00:52:29,858
It was a fight with the guy
I tried to tell you about.

769
00:52:29,858 --> 00:52:31,873
I kicked his butt.

770
00:52:33,210 --> 00:52:35,940
You expect me to be proud of that?

771
00:52:35,940 --> 00:52:37,650
Oh and well you should, Senor.

772
00:52:37,650 --> 00:52:40,360
You should have seen it,
it was a grand spectacle.

773
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:42,010
Charlie, you have been
nothing but trouble

774
00:52:42,010 --> 00:52:44,670
since you got here,
now I am late for a meeting.

775
00:52:44,670 --> 00:52:47,390
I'm in a big hurry, now,
could you please

776
00:52:47,390 --> 00:52:49,723
just say out of trouble until supper?

777
00:53:01,910 --> 00:53:04,583
It's all right, Muchacho,
he just doesn't understand.

778
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:07,470
He never does.

779
00:53:07,470 --> 00:53:08,510
Well perhaps if he had been there?

780
00:53:08,510 --> 00:53:10,533
If he had seen it with his
own eyes.

781
00:53:11,420 --> 00:53:13,483
The only thing he ever
notices is when it's bad.

782
00:53:14,408 --> 00:53:18,330
Well then, what are
you going to do about it?

783
00:53:20,207 --> 00:53:23,117
I think I'm really gonna
get his attention this time.

784
00:53:23,117 --> 00:53:24,950
Yes, how?

785
00:53:26,397 --> 00:53:28,475
I'm going to steal your bones.

786
00:53:28,475 --> 00:53:29,892
Yes.

787
00:53:31,456 --> 00:53:33,706
Very good, Charlie, very good.

788
00:53:46,576 --> 00:53:48,616
(Foreign language)

789
00:53:48,616 --> 00:53:50,966
Um, well it's a keypad.

790
00:53:50,966 --> 00:53:53,863
We have to know the code just
to get into the building.

791
00:53:53,863 --> 00:53:54,696
Code?

792
00:53:56,220 --> 00:53:59,109
Yeah, it's a series of
numbers you have to put in

793
00:53:59,109 --> 00:54:00,117
or the alarm will go off

794
00:54:00,117 --> 00:54:02,067
and the police will be here
in no time.

795
00:54:10,429 --> 00:54:13,330
Ese, it is fortunate that the Mayans

796
00:54:13,330 --> 00:54:14,680
did not have such machines.

797
00:54:42,789 --> 00:54:45,498
Oh, darn it.

798
00:54:45,498 --> 00:54:49,331
Don't worry, Muchacho,
I'll take care of it.

799
00:54:57,070 --> 00:55:01,083
Five, zero, seven!

800
00:55:02,010 --> 00:55:02,843
Two, zero!

801
00:55:05,006 --> 00:55:09,173
Four, two, three, seven.

802
00:55:28,208 --> 00:55:29,797
Here's the next problem.

803
00:55:29,797 --> 00:55:32,397
We need the two keys to
deactivate the alarm.

804
00:55:32,397 --> 00:55:34,843
And only one person has both,
Van Leer.

805
00:55:35,728 --> 00:55:38,498
Well then,
we will have to borrow them.

806
00:55:38,498 --> 00:55:40,509
He'll know they're gone.

807
00:55:40,509 --> 00:55:42,887
Well then, uh, when we borrow them,

808
00:55:42,887 --> 00:55:44,737
we will replace them with
dummy keys.

809
00:55:45,659 --> 00:55:47,159
That would work.

810
00:55:48,797 --> 00:55:49,897
But he said he never takes
them off

811
00:55:49,897 --> 00:55:51,507
that chain around his neck.

812
00:55:51,507 --> 00:55:53,307
He has to take them off some time.

813
00:56:00,853 --> 00:56:01,686
Chuck?

814
00:56:06,544 --> 00:56:08,660
Has he been gone all day?

815
00:56:08,660 --> 00:56:10,570
Yes, he go right after breakfast.

816
00:56:10,570 --> 00:56:12,565
I have not seen him since.

817
00:56:12,565 --> 00:56:14,398
That's not like him.

818
00:56:16,050 --> 00:56:18,703
He's been acting so
strange lately, Mr. Dave.

819
00:56:19,580 --> 00:56:21,380
Talking to people who are not there.

820
00:56:22,332 --> 00:56:23,940
I don't know what's the
matter with him.

821
00:56:23,940 --> 00:56:25,320
I hear him swear in Spanish.

822
00:56:25,320 --> 00:56:27,520
I want you to know I did not
teach him this.

823
00:56:28,704 --> 00:56:31,500
Huh, I know I should be
spending more time with him,

824
00:56:31,500 --> 00:56:32,950
but with the exhibit and all..

825
00:56:32,950 --> 00:56:37,423
And those bones being so close,
makes me think.

826
00:56:40,393 --> 00:56:44,140
This weekend, this weekend,
uh, I'm gonna

827
00:56:44,140 --> 00:56:45,200
make time for him.

828
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:49,093
I'm gonna get tickets to uh,
something, on Saturday.

829
00:56:50,567 --> 00:56:52,500
And church on Sunday.

830
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:53,900
You should go to confession.

831
00:56:56,154 --> 00:56:56,987
Yeah.

832
00:57:02,677 --> 00:57:04,573
Bueno, do you have the keys?

833
00:57:07,010 --> 00:57:10,820
There right here, they
look just like the real ones.

834
00:57:10,820 --> 00:57:12,784
It's the third time you've asked.

835
00:57:12,784 --> 00:57:13,617
Now would you settle down,

836
00:57:13,617 --> 00:57:15,050
you're starting to make me nervous.

837
00:57:17,631 --> 00:57:19,270
Well, if it was your immortal soul

838
00:57:19,270 --> 00:57:21,870
that hung in the balance
you might feel differently.

839
00:57:25,359 --> 00:57:27,692
Hey, hey, wait, he's here.

840
00:57:58,384 --> 00:58:03,384
Vehicle secure.

841
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:21,557
What am I doing, he can't see me.

842
00:58:28,632 --> 00:58:31,271
Nah, nah, na na na, nah, nah, na.

843
00:58:31,271 --> 00:58:32,604
Come on Charlie!

844
00:58:43,021 --> 00:58:43,938
Sweetums?

845
00:58:44,821 --> 00:58:46,407
Gracias Senor Jackass.

846
00:58:46,407 --> 00:58:48,060
I'm home!

847
00:58:48,060 --> 00:58:50,373
Woo, stuffy in here Baby.

848
00:58:55,290 --> 00:58:56,283
That's better.

849
00:58:58,288 --> 00:58:59,887
Charlie?

850
00:58:59,887 --> 00:59:00,720
Charlie?

851
00:59:02,916 --> 00:59:05,463
Hey Sweetums, Daddy's home.

852
00:59:05,463 --> 00:59:07,910
Where's my widdle bird,
he's the tweetest widdle bird

853
00:59:07,910 --> 00:59:11,200
in the whole wide world,
yes you are, yes you are!

854
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:14,755
Do you want some water,
it's so hot in here.

855
00:59:14,755 --> 00:59:18,443
Yes you are, yes you are, bawk.

856
00:59:18,443 --> 00:59:20,763
What a buffoon!

857
00:59:20,763 --> 00:59:22,623
What a buffoon, bawk!

858
00:59:22,623 --> 00:59:23,893
Sweetums!

859
00:59:23,893 --> 00:59:26,013
What did you say?

860
00:59:26,013 --> 00:59:28,864
I said, you are a dolt.

861
00:59:28,864 --> 00:59:31,794
Bawk, you're a dolt!

862
00:59:31,794 --> 00:59:35,172
Sweetums, shame on you
talking to Daddy like that.

863
00:59:35,172 --> 00:59:37,200
Here Baby, have you
been talking to somebody

864
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:38,220
that I don't know about?

865
00:59:38,220 --> 00:59:41,452
You still my sweet widdle
watch bird, like Sweetum?

866
00:59:41,452 --> 00:59:44,210
Yes you are, you tell me
if there's an intwooder?

867
00:59:44,210 --> 00:59:45,886
Bawk, intruder!

868
00:59:45,886 --> 00:59:47,484
That's right, Sweetums,
that's what we say

869
00:59:47,484 --> 00:59:51,984
when we see a stranger,
but why are you saying it now?

870
00:59:53,326 --> 00:59:57,094
(Mutters)
That man is complete imbecile.

871
00:59:57,094 --> 00:59:58,393
Bawk, imbecile.

872
00:59:58,393 --> 00:59:59,673
Shh!

873
00:59:59,673 --> 01:00:02,270
Sweetums, now don't make
Daddy mad at you uh unh uh.

874
01:00:02,270 --> 01:00:04,637
No more television for Sweetums.

875
01:00:04,637 --> 01:00:07,650
You just behave yourself
while Daddy takes a shower.

876
01:00:07,650 --> 01:00:09,583
Come Charlie, now,
he's going to bathe.

877
01:00:12,352 --> 01:00:14,204
Bawk, intruder!

878
01:00:14,204 --> 01:00:16,457
Shh Sweetums, nice Sweetums,
be good bird

879
01:00:16,457 --> 01:00:18,280
and don't touch that button.

880
01:00:18,280 --> 01:00:19,410
That's a good bird.

881
01:00:19,410 --> 01:00:21,884
I have a treat for you,
lucky I don't kill you

882
01:00:21,884 --> 01:00:23,381
and have you for supper!

883
01:00:23,381 --> 01:00:24,254
Intruder!

884
01:00:24,254 --> 01:00:27,054
Shh, that's a nice bird,
I have a treat for you.

885
01:00:28,504 --> 01:00:30,280
Muchacho, come, it's up to you.

886
01:00:30,280 --> 01:00:32,470
Get the keys while I distract
this infernal bird.

887
01:00:32,470 --> 01:00:33,930
Come, come, come, don't waste time.

888
01:00:33,930 --> 01:00:35,973
We don't have time to lose,
go, go, go, go, go!

889
01:00:35,973 --> 01:00:39,272
Shh, don't see us nicely,
Sweetums I will give you a treat,

890
01:00:39,272 --> 01:00:41,013
just shh, be quiet,
I'll get you a treat.

891
01:00:41,013 --> 01:00:42,513
Intruder.

892
01:00:43,752 --> 01:00:46,194
I'll give you a treat,
I'll give you five treats!

893
01:00:46,194 --> 01:00:47,264
Shut up you stupid bird.

894
01:00:50,543 --> 01:00:52,826
♪ They'll be riding (mumbles) ♪

895
01:00:52,826 --> 01:00:55,284
♪ Six white horses when she comes ♪

896
01:00:55,284 --> 01:00:57,215
Sweetums, nice Sweetums, good bird.

897
01:00:57,215 --> 01:00:59,132
Don't press the button.

898
01:01:15,086 --> 01:01:15,919
Who's there?

899
01:01:15,919 --> 01:01:17,454
Sweetums?

900
01:01:17,454 --> 01:01:18,574
What do I do?

901
01:01:18,574 --> 01:01:20,991
Run, Charlie, run, run, go!

902
01:01:24,221 --> 01:01:28,221
Hi ya big Daddy,
hi ya big Daddy, bawk!

903
01:01:34,402 --> 01:01:36,735
Hey you, you little creep!

904
01:01:37,959 --> 01:01:40,959
You're not gonna get away
that easy!

905
01:01:43,563 --> 01:01:44,730
Get back here!

906
01:01:49,755 --> 01:01:50,960
Okay, now what do I do?

907
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:53,440
At first,
you must exchange the keys

908
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:55,491
and then keep on running!

909
01:01:55,491 --> 01:01:57,180
Go, go, go, go, go!

910
01:02:04,696 --> 01:02:06,033
Very nice look!

911
01:02:52,277 --> 01:02:54,640
Don't even try to run, 'cause
you can't get away from me.

912
01:02:54,640 --> 01:02:57,100
Oh my god, stay away from me.

913
01:02:57,100 --> 01:02:58,213
I've got you now.

914
01:03:00,120 --> 01:03:02,964
I'm warning you,
I know how to defend myself.

915
01:03:02,964 --> 01:03:04,580
Who are you?

916
01:03:04,580 --> 01:03:05,570
Who are you?

917
01:03:05,570 --> 01:03:08,693
I'm sorry,
I was chasing a little boy.

918
01:03:10,822 --> 01:03:13,793
Oh you pervert!

919
01:03:18,664 --> 01:03:19,747
Ay caramba!

920
01:03:35,093 --> 01:03:36,690
You all right, Miss?

921
01:03:36,690 --> 01:03:39,543
No, this pervert tried to
attack me.

922
01:03:40,828 --> 01:03:44,937
(Chattering)

923
01:03:44,937 --> 01:03:47,187
Did you take his clothes?

924
01:03:49,230 --> 01:03:51,599
All right, Mister Dangle,
party's over.

925
01:03:51,599 --> 01:03:53,329
What?

926
01:03:53,329 --> 01:03:55,500
Oh, oh no, no, no, no,
you don't understand.

927
01:03:55,500 --> 01:03:58,080
See, um, I was chasing a burglar

928
01:03:58,080 --> 01:04:00,070
and I was in the shower
'cause they took my keys,

929
01:04:00,070 --> 01:04:00,903
that's why I was chasing them, they..

930
01:04:00,903 --> 01:04:02,050
Okay, let me get this straight,

931
01:04:02,050 --> 01:04:04,710
you were taking a shower,
someone stole your keys

932
01:04:04,710 --> 01:04:07,480
so you decided to run
the 50 yard dash, naked.

933
01:04:07,480 --> 01:04:09,630
Not just any keys though,
they were the keys,

934
01:04:09,630 --> 01:04:10,700
the keys to the treasure.

935
01:04:10,700 --> 01:04:11,910
Oh, the treasure keys.

936
01:04:11,910 --> 01:04:14,010
You should have told me,
that makes all the difference.

937
01:04:14,010 --> 01:04:16,000
No, no, you don't get it.

938
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:16,990
See, they were watching me.

939
01:04:16,990 --> 01:04:18,360
They must have had this planned.

940
01:04:18,360 --> 01:04:19,990
They know that I never take
the keys off

941
01:04:19,990 --> 01:04:21,590
from around my neck,
I always have them on my neck.

942
01:04:21,590 --> 01:04:22,423
Always.

943
01:04:23,620 --> 01:04:24,453
These keys?

944
01:04:28,726 --> 01:04:29,559
Come on.

945
01:04:29,559 --> 01:04:30,853
Hey, hey.
Hey, hey.

946
01:04:45,024 --> 01:04:47,693
Such an amazing woman warrior.

947
01:04:47,693 --> 01:04:50,510
She has a most extraordinary
aptitude for combat,

948
01:04:50,510 --> 01:04:51,647
don't you think?

949
01:04:52,807 --> 01:04:56,410
I'd like to go back, you know,
to study her form.

950
01:04:56,410 --> 01:04:57,693
Yeah, I bet you would.

951
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:02,380
You did very good, Muchacho.

952
01:05:03,257 --> 01:05:04,756
It was a grand day!

953
01:05:04,756 --> 01:05:06,006
Yeah, it was.

954
01:05:21,377 --> 01:05:22,970
Hey shrimp!

955
01:05:22,970 --> 01:05:24,770
Isn't it past your bedtime?

956
01:05:24,770 --> 01:05:27,353
Don't you know you can get
hurt staying out after dark?

957
01:05:30,270 --> 01:05:31,783
Come on Guys, let's go get him.

958
01:05:44,353 --> 01:05:45,905
Dad?

959
01:05:55,825 --> 01:05:58,408
Save me Daddy, save me Daddy.

960
01:06:00,350 --> 01:06:03,280
Well, doesn't look like
your dad's gonna be here

961
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:04,330
to save you, does it?

962
01:06:05,490 --> 01:06:07,900
Look Tuggle,
I don't wanna fight you.

963
01:06:07,900 --> 01:06:09,970
I didn't wanna fight you the
first time.

964
01:06:09,970 --> 01:06:13,017
But you see,
I don't think you get it.

965
01:06:13,017 --> 01:06:14,310
I'm not here to fight you.

966
01:06:14,310 --> 01:06:16,960
I'm here to get payment
for the boots and clothes

967
01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:19,030
that you ruined and I'm
gonna take that payment

968
01:06:19,030 --> 01:06:24,030
out of your hide,
so hold still Charlie.

969
01:06:24,080 --> 01:06:26,030
This will only hurt until you
pass out.

970
01:06:32,584 --> 01:06:35,100
What the hell is that?

971
01:06:35,100 --> 01:06:37,513
I'm warning you Tuggle,
I have powers.

972
01:06:38,926 --> 01:06:40,469
Powers?

973
01:06:40,469 --> 01:06:42,488
I have the power to raise the dead!

974
01:06:55,232 --> 01:06:56,982
I want out of here.

975
01:06:58,247 --> 01:07:00,951
Look, make it stop, you know
I was just kidding with you.

976
01:07:00,951 --> 01:07:05,951
Spirits of the dead, arise!

977
01:07:06,862 --> 01:07:08,112
Come on, Man.

978
01:07:18,438 --> 01:07:20,118
What kind of a freak are you?

979
01:07:36,657 --> 01:07:37,490
Yes!

980
01:07:38,974 --> 01:07:42,570
Impressive Muchacho.

981
01:07:42,570 --> 01:07:44,417
You belong on the stage!

982
01:07:44,417 --> 01:07:45,250
Thanks.

983
01:07:46,577 --> 01:07:49,244
I was just about to be dog meat.

984
01:07:54,769 --> 01:07:57,237
Hombre!

985
01:07:57,237 --> 01:08:00,308
Charlie, what did you do?

986
01:08:00,308 --> 01:08:02,270
Dad, it wasn't me, honest,
it was this guy

987
01:08:02,270 --> 01:08:03,350
named Mitch Tuggle.

988
01:08:03,350 --> 01:08:04,183
Save it!

989
01:08:07,020 --> 01:08:09,550
You know better than to even
be in here.

990
01:08:09,550 --> 01:08:10,810
Dad, it wasn't me.

991
01:08:10,810 --> 01:08:12,317
Not another word!

992
01:08:31,270 --> 01:08:32,470
Things aren't working out too well

993
01:08:32,470 --> 01:08:33,920
between us are they, Charlie?

994
01:08:36,190 --> 01:08:37,340
It's probably my fault.

995
01:08:39,923 --> 01:08:41,527
I guess I'm just not, you know,

996
01:08:44,913 --> 01:08:47,203
I guess I'm just not, uh,
doing it right.

997
01:08:49,830 --> 01:08:53,130
I mean, you need somebody
who is around all the time,

998
01:08:53,130 --> 01:08:58,130
obviously and uh,
and I can't be, 'cause I'm working,

999
01:08:59,630 --> 01:09:03,040
I mean, look, I'd like to be around,

1000
01:09:03,040 --> 01:09:08,040
but well, ever since the tomb.

1001
01:09:15,330 --> 01:09:16,470
I think you're gonna have

1002
01:09:16,470 --> 01:09:21,063
to maybe go live with your grandparents.

1003
01:09:23,616 --> 01:09:26,003
At least they'll, they'll be around.

1004
01:09:27,020 --> 01:09:30,020
Dad, it wasn't me.

1005
01:09:30,020 --> 01:09:32,853
Charlie, go back to the house.

1006
01:09:35,120 --> 01:09:40,120
I'm gonna clean up here for
awhile and think about all this.

1007
01:10:28,250 --> 01:10:30,357
I owe you an apology, Muchacho.

1008
01:10:31,750 --> 01:10:34,363
I have been selfish to
ask you to do what I have.

1009
01:10:38,374 --> 01:10:39,780
(Foreign language)

1010
01:10:39,780 --> 01:10:40,730
I'm sorry, Charlie.

1011
01:10:43,290 --> 01:10:45,573
I deserve to walk in
limbo for all eternity.

1012
01:10:49,140 --> 01:10:51,440
I release you of your
pledge to bury my bones.

1013
01:10:52,870 --> 01:10:54,923
I've caused you enough sorrow.

1014
01:10:59,852 --> 01:11:04,852
Adios, my little Carlito.

1015
01:11:07,595 --> 01:11:12,595
Coronado?

1016
01:11:22,266 --> 01:11:26,516
I have been selfish to
ask you to do what I have.

1017
01:11:28,513 --> 01:11:30,635
(Foreign language)

1018
01:11:30,635 --> 01:11:32,135
I'm sorry Charlie.

1019
01:11:33,183 --> 01:11:36,850
I deserve to walk in
limbo for all eternity.

1020
01:11:39,287 --> 01:11:43,148
I release you of your
pledge to bury my bones.

1021
01:11:43,148 --> 01:11:45,648
I've caused you enough sorrow.

1022
01:11:50,031 --> 01:11:52,114
Adios, my little Carlito.

1023
01:11:57,664 --> 01:11:58,581
Coronado?

1024
01:12:20,932 --> 01:12:21,765
Ha.

1025
01:12:21,765 --> 01:12:22,598
Good evening Officer.

1026
01:12:22,598 --> 01:12:23,503
Come on, Martin, come on,
come on, come on.

1027
01:12:24,550 --> 01:12:25,383
All right, all right.

1028
01:12:25,383 --> 01:12:27,423
Step, step, step.

1029
01:12:31,070 --> 01:12:33,733
I was right, Man,
you've been working too hard.

1030
01:12:33,733 --> 01:12:35,040
And when I told you to go out
and mingle,

1031
01:12:35,040 --> 01:12:38,150
I had no idea you were
gonna do it in the buff.

1032
01:12:38,150 --> 01:12:42,393
Hey, hey, 50 foot drop, woo.

1033
01:12:44,040 --> 01:12:46,377
I always knew you were
wrapped too tight, Martin,

1034
01:12:46,377 --> 01:12:48,530
but come on, running down
the middle of the street

1035
01:12:48,530 --> 01:12:50,170
stark naked, good golly!

1036
01:12:50,170 --> 01:12:52,250
Shut up Daryl and take me home.

1037
01:12:52,250 --> 01:12:54,350
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

1038
01:12:54,350 --> 01:12:55,622
Hey, put it away!

1039
01:12:55,622 --> 01:12:57,720
What does this cover?

1040
01:12:57,720 --> 01:13:01,277
Well it wasn't me who
decided to drop trou',

1041
01:13:02,330 --> 01:13:03,940
go for a little run down the street

1042
01:13:03,940 --> 01:13:07,350
in his birthday suit, was it, huh?

1043
01:13:09,790 --> 01:13:11,560
Let me tell you something,
I had to pull

1044
01:13:11,560 --> 01:13:13,580
quite a few strings to
get you out of this too.

1045
01:13:13,580 --> 01:13:14,910
You owe me, big time.

1046
01:13:14,910 --> 01:13:16,170
Thank you Daryl.

1047
01:13:16,170 --> 01:13:18,894
What'd you think, you were
back in the ballpark, huh?

1048
01:13:18,894 --> 01:13:20,326
Don't you wish.

1049
01:13:20,326 --> 01:13:23,266
Selling wieners again?

1050
01:13:23,266 --> 01:13:25,599
Get away from me, will ya?

1051
01:13:50,552 --> 01:13:52,469
They switched the keys.

1052
01:13:54,312 --> 01:13:58,403
I need to get in that place
and I'll be ready for them.

1053
01:13:58,403 --> 01:14:03,010
If only I had my glasses,
I could have identified them.

1054
01:14:03,010 --> 01:14:04,610
Oh, they thought they were
pretty clever, Sweetums.

1055
01:14:04,610 --> 01:14:06,887
But not too clever for Daddy.

1056
01:14:08,174 --> 01:14:12,091
Run, Charlie, run, Charlie,
run, bawk.

1057
01:14:39,792 --> 01:14:42,067
(Mumbling) Negative.

1058
01:14:42,067 --> 01:14:47,067
Okay, that's a permit (mumbling).

1059
01:14:47,072 --> 01:14:47,905
(Mumbling)
All right, 10-4, 10-96.

1060
01:14:47,905 --> 01:14:52,072
(Mumbling) 10-4.

1061
01:14:53,567 --> 01:14:57,984
(Chatter)

1062
01:16:17,697 --> 01:16:21,330
I'm sorry, Dad,
but I've gotta do

1063
01:16:21,330 --> 01:16:22,580
at least one thing right.

1064
01:16:59,686 --> 01:17:03,130
Well, if it isn't the
professor's son.

1065
01:17:03,130 --> 01:17:05,280
Visiting hours are over, Boy,

1066
01:17:05,280 --> 01:17:07,960
so I guess that makes this
grand theft

1067
01:17:07,960 --> 01:17:10,313
and you get to do a nice
long stretch in juvie.

1068
01:17:11,888 --> 01:17:14,380
Thought you were pretty
damn smart, didn't you?

1069
01:17:14,380 --> 01:17:16,470
Sneaking into my house and
taking my keys,

1070
01:17:16,470 --> 01:17:17,887
well why did you do it?

1071
01:17:19,801 --> 01:17:21,368
Huh, why'd you do it?

1072
01:17:21,368 --> 01:17:23,618
Because of me!

1073
01:17:28,120 --> 01:17:29,220
Who else is in here?

1074
01:17:30,730 --> 01:17:32,620
Come on, who else is in here?

1075
01:17:32,620 --> 01:17:33,583
Who said that?

1076
01:17:35,160 --> 01:17:38,043
Don't be afraid of old
Van Leer, speak right up.

1077
01:17:39,721 --> 01:17:42,520
It was I,

1078
01:17:42,520 --> 01:17:45,687
Frederico Cavrell Disposa De Coronado!

1079
01:17:52,808 --> 01:17:56,410
No, no, no, you can't expect me

1080
01:17:56,410 --> 01:17:59,660
to believe that because
Coronado's dead

1081
01:17:59,660 --> 01:18:02,220
and I've got his bones
right here in this sack.

1082
01:18:02,220 --> 01:18:05,783
Now, you come out where I can
see you.

1083
01:18:07,030 --> 01:18:09,193
Why don't you come and get me?

1084
01:18:10,440 --> 01:18:14,647
Okay, all right, you just
show me where you are, Buddy.

1085
01:18:16,249 --> 01:18:18,250
(Foreign language) Down here!

1086
01:18:18,250 --> 01:18:19,410
Where?

1087
01:18:19,410 --> 01:18:20,620
I'm in the sack.

1088
01:18:20,620 --> 01:18:21,453
What?

1089
01:18:22,359 --> 01:18:25,375
Well, go on, open it!

1090
01:18:25,375 --> 01:18:26,713
Come on!

1091
01:18:26,713 --> 01:18:28,084
Come on, open it!

1092
01:18:28,084 --> 01:18:28,917
Oh, no.

1093
01:18:28,917 --> 01:18:31,167
What are you waiting for,
open it you Baby.

1094
01:18:35,300 --> 01:18:38,173
Surprise!

1095
01:18:47,790 --> 01:18:49,470
You came back.

1096
01:18:49,470 --> 01:18:51,710
Muchacho, what are you doing?

1097
01:18:51,710 --> 01:18:53,550
Well, you know I thought I'd
help out this friend of mine

1098
01:18:53,550 --> 01:18:55,563
and throw his old bones in
the cemetery.

1099
01:18:58,150 --> 01:19:02,785
Well, come Charlie,
we don't have much time.

1100
01:19:02,785 --> 01:19:04,923
Better get going.

1101
01:19:38,038 --> 01:19:42,173
Oh no, no, no please,
don't hurt me please, don't..

1102
01:19:42,173 --> 01:19:44,575
No, no, no, Martin,
Martin, it's me, Dave.

1103
01:19:44,575 --> 01:19:47,660
Dave, Dave,
the head was in the bag.

1104
01:19:47,660 --> 01:19:51,064
It talked to me Dave,
the head was in the bag!

1105
01:19:51,064 --> 01:19:53,060
Look, what happened here, Martin?

1106
01:19:53,060 --> 01:19:53,893
Who did this?

1107
01:19:53,893 --> 01:19:55,040
The ghost, the ghost.

1108
01:19:55,040 --> 01:19:56,750
They took the bones in
the bag and they're gonna

1109
01:19:56,750 --> 01:19:59,087
bury them in the cemetery.

1110
01:19:59,087 --> 01:20:01,838
Look, Martin,
I want you to call the police,

1111
01:20:01,838 --> 01:20:04,825
okay and tell them to
meet me in the cemetery.

1112
01:20:04,825 --> 01:20:07,966
I'll call the police and
tell them to meet you at the,

1113
01:20:07,966 --> 01:20:11,815
okay, okay Dave,
don't turn the lights out!

1114
01:20:11,815 --> 01:20:15,187
I've fallen and I can't get up!

1115
01:20:15,187 --> 01:20:16,020
Help me!

1116
01:20:25,156 --> 01:20:26,406
Hi!

1117
01:20:27,926 --> 01:20:29,356
You made it.

1118
01:20:29,356 --> 01:20:32,689
Come Muchacho,
there's no time to waste.

1119
01:21:17,774 --> 01:21:18,607
Hey!

1120
01:21:28,465 --> 01:21:29,298
Charlie?

1121
01:21:35,718 --> 01:21:39,293
That's it, that's it,
it's all over.

1122
01:21:44,040 --> 01:21:46,856
You're gonna go stay
at your grandparents'.

1123
01:21:46,856 --> 01:21:47,689
Dad..

1124
01:21:47,689 --> 01:21:49,830
No, no, no, not a word.

1125
01:21:49,830 --> 01:21:51,103
Don't say anything.

1126
01:21:52,580 --> 01:21:54,050
I'll get them, I'll..

1127
01:21:54,050 --> 01:21:56,700
Don't touch anything,
please, don't touch anything.

1128
01:22:35,110 --> 01:22:37,510
From such an educated man,
I had expected

1129
01:22:37,510 --> 01:22:39,593
a much more eloquent response.

1130
01:22:42,190 --> 01:22:43,853
You're uh?

1131
01:22:43,853 --> 01:22:45,103
Don't you recognize me?

1132
01:22:46,715 --> 01:22:48,107
You're..

1133
01:22:48,980 --> 01:22:53,360
Yes, yes, it is I, Frederico Cavrell,

1134
01:22:53,360 --> 01:22:54,790
well you know the rest.

1135
01:22:58,447 --> 01:23:00,150
I, I don't believe it.

1136
01:23:00,150 --> 01:23:02,530
Come, come Man,
you spent your whole career

1137
01:23:02,530 --> 01:23:04,270
looking for me,
don't you have anything

1138
01:23:04,270 --> 01:23:05,763
more intelligent to say?

1139
01:23:06,810 --> 01:23:11,810
Um, uh, yes, um, could you

1140
01:23:12,090 --> 01:23:14,360
tell me about your life, please?

1141
01:23:14,360 --> 01:23:15,780
My life?

1142
01:23:15,780 --> 01:23:18,900
My life is not important,
it's over.

1143
01:23:18,900 --> 01:23:21,080
I'm here to warn you about
your life.

1144
01:23:21,080 --> 01:23:24,333
That you're wasting it by
focusing too much on the past.

1145
01:23:25,310 --> 01:23:30,193
But, the past is important,
I mean, the things

1146
01:23:31,040 --> 01:23:32,460
that you've seen..

1147
01:23:32,460 --> 01:23:34,753
Yes, yes, I've seen wondrous things.

1148
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,883
I've seen lands where, where
no man has ever been before.

1149
01:23:40,152 --> 01:23:43,453
But for all the glory
and all the adventure,

1150
01:23:44,670 --> 01:23:46,770
you know the thing that
I regret the most,

1151
01:23:48,770 --> 01:23:52,223
is that I never saw my
son grow into a man.

1152
01:23:55,730 --> 01:23:58,833
You and I, we spent our whole
life looking for treasure.

1153
01:24:00,070 --> 01:24:03,320
What you don't realize is
that the greatest treasure

1154
01:24:03,320 --> 01:24:06,650
has been right beside you all along.

1155
01:24:20,960 --> 01:24:23,010
I'm sorry, I understand.

1156
01:24:29,860 --> 01:24:31,933
I think we should bury his bones.

1157
01:24:37,693 --> 01:24:38,823
Gracias Professor.

1158
01:24:41,253 --> 01:24:43,660
But what will the
people at the museum say?

1159
01:24:43,660 --> 01:24:47,830
Well, uh, I'll replace
them with plaster ones

1160
01:24:47,830 --> 01:24:49,990
that I made in the workshop.

1161
01:24:49,990 --> 01:24:51,690
They'll never know the difference.

1162
01:24:52,834 --> 01:24:56,447
You are a man of honor with
a few tricks of your own.

1163
01:25:00,077 --> 01:25:01,423
Bueno, then this is it.

1164
01:25:02,485 --> 01:25:03,435
My final adventure.

1165
01:25:06,626 --> 01:25:08,460
Well, I was never very good
at goodbyes,

1166
01:25:08,460 --> 01:25:11,533
so let's get this over with.

1167
01:25:11,533 --> 01:25:15,120
Don't be sad, muchacho,
this is what I wanted.

1168
01:25:15,120 --> 01:25:15,970
Are you afraid?

1169
01:25:17,776 --> 01:25:19,863
No, I'll be with my son again,

1170
01:25:20,760 --> 01:25:21,860
thanks to you Charlie.

1171
01:25:24,867 --> 01:25:27,620
This is a fine boy you
have here, Professor.

1172
01:25:27,620 --> 01:25:29,107
You take good care of him.

1173
01:25:32,390 --> 01:25:33,290
I will, Capitan.

1174
01:25:34,240 --> 01:25:36,903
Live a long and prosperous
life, Charlie,

1175
01:25:37,940 --> 01:25:41,350
and when the time comes,
I'll see you in paradise.

1176
01:25:43,316 --> 01:25:44,149
Goodbye.

1177
01:26:09,815 --> 01:26:14,815
Goodbye Charlie, adios!
