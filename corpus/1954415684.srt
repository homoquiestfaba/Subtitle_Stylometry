00:00:44,496 --> 00:00:47,628
**Power shuts off**

00:00:50,690 --> 00:01:03,376

00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:31,080
 Revived

00:04:27,472 --> 00:05:06,322
**Music**

00:05:22,524 --> 00:05:24,524
**Phone Ringing**

6
00:05:28,854 --> 00:05:30,854
**Phone Ringing**

So what are you doing tonight?

11
00:05:40,972 --> 00:05:43,288
I was thinking about going to that one house

C'mon man just for tonight

This one last time and I won't ever drag
you out to one of these things again

18
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:05,890
Trust me there's nothing there!

00:06:05,899 --> 00:06:10,013
One of our friends seen something out there,
We have a good chance of seeing something

00:06:10,017 --> 00:06:13,844
OK!
We'll go there but 5 minutes we see nothing there were gone

21
00:06:13,849 --> 00:06:15,854

00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,875
Half an hour.. Tops?

27
00:06:31,937 --> 00:06:34,753
Fuck!
He said he was gonna be here already

28
00:06:47,689 --> 00:06:51,539
Finally!
Only took him a half an hour to get here

29
00:06:59,874 --> 00:07:02,832
What the hell took you so long?

30
00:07:02,983 --> 00:07:04,983
I was making my way

31
00:07:05,024 --> 00:07:07,024
I just got done work

32
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,784
Well...

33
00:07:08,787 --> 00:07:11,043
I'm bringing this camera along with us,
As you can see

34
00:07:11,397 --> 00:07:13,397
Nice camera!
where did you get that?

35
00:07:13,505 --> 00:07:15,505
I got it last week

36
00:07:16,907 --> 00:07:18,651
HD Camera?

37
00:07:18,682 --> 00:07:20,362
Yup
Top of the line!

38
00:07:20,386 --> 00:07:22,706
For now till next week probably

39
00:07:22,752 --> 00:07:24,752
You gonna upgrade already?

40
00:07:24,755 --> 00:07:25,107
No!

41
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:29,553
I just mean that's when new cameras are gonna 
come out probably you know how that world works

42
00:07:29,559 --> 00:07:31,097
Ya technology..

43
00:07:31,141 --> 00:07:33,141
ya,
it's good for a day

44
00:07:35,486 --> 00:07:37,486
You ready for this?

45
00:07:37,548 --> 00:07:39,548
Ready to waste my time..

46
00:07:39,614 --> 00:07:43,924
Well you can call it what you want
But who knows you might get surprised

47
00:07:43,948 --> 00:07:46,764
It's pretty creepy out there I've seen a picture of it

48
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:47,646
Oh Ya?

49
00:07:47,658 --> 00:07:49,262
Well I just kinda wanted to do something

50
00:07:49,263 --> 00:07:51,263
I was kinda getting bored

51
00:07:51,274 --> 00:07:53,910
Iv'e been doing nothing but work
and staying home

52
00:07:53,933 --> 00:07:55,933
are you gonna be documenting me too?

53
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:58,419
Yeah!
you got a problem with that?

54
00:07:58,452 --> 00:07:59,505
I Might!!

55
00:08:02,665 --> 00:08:04,738
This is a long fucking ride.. Man

56
00:08:04,745 --> 00:08:06,745
I hope it's down this road up here

57
00:08:07,219 --> 00:08:10,827
Where did wayne's friend say it was located?

58
00:08:11,022 --> 00:08:13,022
He said it was down here somewhere

59
00:08:13,187 --> 00:08:17,103
On one of these side roads
I think road started with an 'M'

60
00:08:17,385 --> 00:08:19,033
Oh! Mersea road?

61
00:08:19,053 --> 00:08:20,093
Ya that was it!

62
00:08:20,096 --> 00:08:21,488
Mersea road 23 right?

63
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:23,188
- Ya oh ya
- Ok

64
00:08:23,249 --> 00:08:25,825
I think I know where that is just
gotta take a left right up here

65
00:08:26,052 --> 00:08:29,012
Glad we're not going at night man,
because I'd be scared shitless

66
00:08:29,035 --> 00:08:31,707
Well it's almost night, In about one more hour

67
00:08:31,753 --> 00:08:35,301
Half an hour we're gonna be outta there hopefully

68
00:08:35,328 --> 00:08:36,944
That's what I promised

69
00:08:37,284 --> 00:08:39,796
It's gotta be somewhere around here

70
00:08:42,488 --> 00:08:44,914
Ugh it's muddy out here!

71
00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:50,628
Where you going?

72
00:08:52,381 --> 00:08:54,381
going to higher ground?

73
00:09:03,888 --> 00:09:05,888
Let me see that camera

74
00:09:07,769 --> 00:09:10,249
Shit!
It's all zoomed in..

75
00:09:11,439 --> 00:09:14,911
Dude!
I think we are in the wrong spot right now

76
00:09:19,794 --> 00:09:21,794
Where did you say this house was?

77
00:09:22,587 --> 00:09:23,691
WHAT?

78
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:25,790
Where did you say this house was?

79
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,920
I don't know its over here somewhere

80
00:09:30,712 --> 00:09:32,936
We are definitely in the wrong spot

81
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,880
So you wanted to document this,
Go ahead and document it

82
00:09:43,433 --> 00:09:44,217
**cough**

83
00:09:48,736 --> 00:09:50,736
I don't know where this thing is?

84
00:09:51,143 --> 00:09:53,495
He said it was down this road.

85
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:55,390
We've been driving all over

86
00:09:55,407 --> 00:09:57,983
I don't even see any houses down this road
Maybe..

87
00:09:58,258 --> 00:10:00,962
- I'm on Mersea road
- Wait a second

88
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,784
Maybe it's down this road

89
00:10:02,802 --> 00:10:04,930
Is it that one right there man?

90
00:10:05,468 --> 00:10:07,468
I think that's it

91
00:10:07,616 --> 00:10:11,408
It looks pretty small though,
You sure that's a house?

92
00:10:11,445 --> 00:10:13,445
Looks all beat up

93
00:10:13,536 --> 00:10:15,536
Looks pretty dilapidated

94
00:10:16,813 --> 00:10:19,133
I have no clue,
But I think that's it!

95
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:21,421
That's where wayne seen it right?

96
00:10:21,687 --> 00:10:25,104
What's the number again 19.. 1909?

97
00:10:25,257 --> 00:10:29,689
- He didn't really tell me the number..
- Something like that

98
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:31,740
I don't know let's just go check it out

99
00:10:33,013 --> 00:10:35,589
I'm having second thought about this

100
00:10:35,674 --> 00:10:37,674
Why you getting scared now?

101
00:10:37,696 --> 00:10:41,336
I'm not scared I just don't wanna trespasse
on places where i'm not supposed to be

102
00:10:41,627 --> 00:10:43,627
He said no one lived there

103
00:10:43,986 --> 00:10:46,873
So what are we gonna do?
Just go in and check?

104
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,880
Real quick or something

105
00:10:48,911 --> 00:10:51,711
Well I don't know
we'll go look and see what we can see

106
00:10:51,756 --> 00:10:53,756
I don't know if i wanna go in

107
00:10:53,792 --> 00:10:56,661
Looks like we could fall through
the floor if anything

108
00:10:56,665 --> 00:11:00,099
Wow look at the thing man it doesn't look too safe

109
00:11:00,171 --> 00:11:01,931
What's that number?

110
00:11:01,968 --> 00:11:03,800
Its 190....

111
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:08,293
- It's 1906 it is man that's the house
- Ya that's what it was

112
00:11:10,848 --> 00:11:18,090
It doesn't look as scary as I thought it would be,
But it definitely looks like something pretty bad happened here

113
00:11:18,518 --> 00:11:22,084
So we're just gonna go take a look inside
and then we'll leave right?

114
00:11:22,089 --> 00:11:24,019
Will you be happy with that?

115
00:11:24,023 --> 00:11:25,015
I guess

116
00:11:25,035 --> 00:11:26,395
Ok let's do this

117
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:39,770
This is definitely it!

118
00:11:40,401 --> 00:11:42,401
We gotta go check this out

119
00:11:43,326 --> 00:11:45,092
How do we get down here?

120
00:11:46,992 --> 00:11:48,992
There's not even a path way

121
00:11:50,513 --> 00:11:53,371
Alright. Let's try not to fall with this camera

122
00:11:56,646 --> 00:11:57,593
Holy shit!

123
00:12:00,135 --> 00:12:02,525
We should definitely not be doing this right now

124
00:12:03,918 --> 00:12:06,698
Well we're just gonna take a peek 
and then we'll leave if you want

125
00:12:07,533 --> 00:12:09,533
Holy fuck! is this a ditch?

126
00:12:11,406 --> 00:12:13,406
Are you sure this is abandoned man?

127
00:12:13,712 --> 00:12:17,004
It looks like it the door is..
What was that?

128
00:12:18,153 --> 00:12:20,153
Ok I think it was just the stairs creaking

129
00:12:20,571 --> 00:12:22,571
I think i'm just scaring myself right now

130
00:12:24,432 --> 00:12:26,159
Dude man?¨

131
00:12:26,382 --> 00:12:27,392
Dude man!!

132
00:12:27,395 --> 00:12:28,558
What?

133
00:12:31,256 --> 00:12:33,256
What is this place?

134
00:12:33,852 --> 00:12:36,996
Dude something just moved
man let's get out of here

135
00:12:37,119 --> 00:12:38,635
I thought you said nobody was in here

136
00:12:38,692 --> 00:12:39,944
Go! Man!

137
00:12:47,272 --> 00:12:49,272
You said this was abandon

138
00:12:49,989 --> 00:12:51,989
Thought it was he said it was

139
00:12:53,344 --> 00:12:56,972
Oh crap I think I dropped my wallet back there

140
00:12:57,047 --> 00:12:58,827
You fucking dropped your wallet!?

141
00:12:58,838 --> 00:13:00,152
Did you see that?

142
00:13:00,892 --> 00:13:02,388
There was somebody in there right?

143
00:13:00,178 --> 00:13:00,876
What?

144
00:13:02,432 --> 00:13:04,432
I don't know I thought I seen a
little something but i don't know

145
00:13:04,637 --> 00:13:06,637
I'll take a look in this window

146
00:13:08,008 --> 00:13:10,008
I'm gonna grab my wallet

147
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:11,694

OK let's get the fuck outta here man

00:13:51,285 --> 00:13:53,285

My arms pretty twisted man

172
00:15:30,267 --> 00:15:33,946
It's said that many of these
souls still walk the decks

173
00:15:33,965 --> 00:15:36,394
Some tied by their awful murders

174
00:15:36,451 --> 00:15:38,607
Others by their devotion to duty

175
00:15:41,549 --> 00:15:46,327
Vince wilson and his team of researchers from 
the baltimore society for paranormal research

176
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:47,260
Have come to..

177
00:17:00,954 --> 00:17:02,954
**Door Buzzing!!**

178
00:17:11,863 --> 00:17:13,317

**Knock! Knock!**

197

What's going on?

198
00:18:51,962 --> 00:18:53,491
How did you get in here?

199
00:18:53,662 --> 00:18:55,662
Uh! there's someone fixing the door out there

200
00:18:57,410 --> 00:18:59,410
That would explain all the buzzing this morning

201
00:19:00,001 --> 00:19:02,001
Why your thing was going haywire

202
00:19:02,727 --> 00:19:04,081
It was was going haywire

203
00:19:05,747 --> 00:19:09,005
That's why I was surprised when
you called me today

204
00:19:09,948 --> 00:19:11,098
Why?

205
00:19:11,508 --> 00:19:13,508
I was just running late

206
00:19:19,876 --> 00:19:21,876
I heard nobody answering

207
00:19:23,778 --> 00:19:25,778
That's weird must have been just the guy

208
00:19:26,939 --> 00:19:28,939
Just don't wanna bother you

209
00:19:31,414 --> 00:19:33,414
What have been up too?

210
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:36,220
Nothing much right now

211
00:19:36,226 --> 00:19:38,226
How's the hand?

212
00:19:38,953 --> 00:19:40,205
Fine

213
00:19:40,716 --> 00:19:42,716
Does it hurt?

214
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:44,175
Not broken?

215
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,288
My Finger is broken my pinky

216
00:19:46,294 --> 00:19:47,070
OH!

217
00:19:48,152 --> 00:19:49,472
But...

218
00:19:50,187 --> 00:19:52,187
I'm doing alright

219
00:19:52,346 --> 00:19:53,088
ya

220
00:19:53,436 --> 00:19:55,436
It was a nice bail that I took though

221
00:19:56,064 --> 00:19:58,064
Ya that was actually the highlight 
of the trip I thought

222
00:19:58,098 --> 00:20:00,098
It fellt weird like something just like..

223
00:20:01,006 --> 00:20:03,006
Like something just pick me up..

224
00:20:00,098 --> 00:20:00,833
What?

225
00:20:03,224 --> 00:20:05,224
It didn't' feel like I tripped or fell

226
00:20:05,298 --> 00:20:09,110
It felt like someone you know spread me, 
like just knocked me right over

227
00:20:10,002 --> 00:20:11,526
That's weird

228
00:20:11,535 --> 00:20:12,263
It was

229
00:20:12,267 --> 00:20:14,267
It wasn't even windy or anything

230
00:20:14,299 --> 00:20:16,299
It was windy but it wasn't like you know..

231
00:20:16,379 --> 00:20:18,379
Well it wasn't a tornado out there

232
00:20:18,408 --> 00:20:19,660
Ya obviously!

233
00:20:21,387 --> 00:20:26,232
I got a doctor's consent saying I should
be taking off 3 days to rest my hand

234
00:20:26,531 --> 00:20:27,959
Nice little vacation

235
00:20:28,164 --> 00:20:29,020
OH YA!

236
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:31,660
Just thinking about going over 
to break time corner

237
00:20:32,355 --> 00:20:35,444
Alright.
I can go for some of that

238
00:20:35,942 --> 00:20:37,942
Should I bring this with us?

239
00:20:37,973 --> 00:20:40,325
Man stop documenting every moment of my life

240
00:20:40,688 --> 00:20:42,644
Alright i'll shut it off for now

241
00:21:47,826 --> 00:21:51,219
**Moaning**

242
00:22:27,216 --> 00:22:29,216
**Unknown noise behind door**

243
00:24:13,657 --> 00:24:19,001
Ya I really needed this man I haven't been getting
much sleep lately i've been really restless at night

244
00:24:19,069 --> 00:24:20,562
Ya same here

245
00:24:21,551 --> 00:24:22,459
Ya!

246
00:24:20,564 --> 00:24:21,539
Really?

247
00:24:23,852 --> 00:24:25,852
Ever since we've been to that house man

248
00:24:26,556 --> 00:24:28,556
I don't know what it is but...

249
00:24:28,562 --> 00:24:30,562
I just can't stop thinking about it

250
00:24:32,302 --> 00:24:34,302
I could have sworn that we've seen something there

251
00:24:35,763 --> 00:24:38,919
I don't know maybe it was just a raccoon or something.
But..

252
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:41,340
I sure felt something

253
00:24:41,352 --> 00:24:43,352
I know I don't even know what happened to you

254
00:24:44,304 --> 00:24:47,086
That was the weirdest thing i've ever seen in my life

255
00:24:48,626 --> 00:24:51,782
I don't even know how you can sleep

256
00:24:52,329 --> 00:24:54,329
Because I'd be up all night

257
00:25:02,936 --> 00:25:04,177
Oh wow!

258
00:25:04,237 --> 00:25:06,237
Way to go, 
Way to fuckin cast

259
00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:16,324
That was a nice cast man

260
00:25:16,329 --> 00:25:18,605
Thanks i've been working on that actually

261
00:25:20,922 --> 00:25:26,315
You think there's any fish in this pond man we come 
here almost every weekend and never catch nothing

262
00:25:26,594 --> 00:25:28,594
I have hope one day we'll catch something

263
00:25:49,314 --> 00:25:51,314
Dam!
I lost my bait

264
00:26:04,095 --> 00:26:06,095
It's five o'clock already

265
00:26:06,224 --> 00:26:07,243
- Really?

266
00:26:07,254 --> 00:26:08,318
Wow

267
00:26:12,007 --> 00:26:14,007
All day and nothing

268
00:26:15,399 --> 00:26:16,892
Not even one nibble

269
00:26:14,703 --> 00:26:15,377
I know

270
00:26:17,305 --> 00:26:19,032
I thought I had a couple nibbles

271
00:26:20,052 --> 00:26:22,052
They definitely stole a couple of my worms

272
00:26:27,823 --> 00:26:29,823
What was that??

273
00:26:30,087 --> 00:26:32,087
what?

274
00:26:32,206 --> 00:26:34,206
I heard something out there

275
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:36,836
It's probably just the wind 
it's pretty windy out today

276
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:38,400
YA!

277
00:26:46,064 --> 00:26:48,064
I definitely heard something over there

278
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:50,750
If you're so worried about it go check it out

279
00:26:52,354 --> 00:26:54,354
Well...

280
00:26:54,558 --> 00:26:57,026

281
00:26:57,946 --> 00:26:59,244

284
00:28:11,841 --> 00:28:13,841
**Dailing cell phone**

285
00:28:35,336 --> 00:28:37,804
**Phone vibrating**

286
00:28:42,446 --> 00:28:44,446

00:29:48,529 --> 00:29:54,117
No I didn't see anything but, I heard you were
seeing things so I had to play a little game on you

291
00:29:54,156 --> 00:29:55,571

00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:57,584

294
00:30:00,748 --> 00:30:02,748
So..

295
00:30:02,868 --> 00:30:04,868

300
00:30:33,647 --> 00:30:35,647
Mersea massacre!

301
00:30:41,393 --> 00:30:44,413
Hey it says that the house is located in collingswood

302
00:30:44,444 --> 00:30:46,444
Really.
That's nice.

303
00:30:47,130 --> 00:30:49,130
Well I kinda wanna go there!

304
00:30:49,457 --> 00:30:50,885
Really!?

305
00:30:51,243 --> 00:30:53,243
Ya I wanna go check it out

306
00:30:53,458 --> 00:30:56,277
After what happened to months
ago you still wanna go there

307
00:30:56,493 --> 00:30:58,493
I just need some closure man!

308
00:30:59,776 --> 00:31:01,776
Oh God not the woods again.

309
00:31:01,846 --> 00:31:03,626
Are you ready for the woods??

310
00:31:03,633 --> 00:31:05,633
As long as you don't pull any stunts this time

311
00:31:05,672 --> 00:31:06,704
ya...

312
00:31:06,942 --> 00:31:09,294
It's pretty creepy something tore this place up

313
00:31:09,971 --> 00:31:12,763
We had a tornado here,
Last year

314
00:31:12,768 --> 00:31:14,234
- Oh really?
- YA

315
00:31:14,267 --> 00:31:15,799
As you can see

316
00:31:15,846 --> 00:31:17,391
They still haven't cleaned it up?

317
00:31:17,438 --> 00:31:20,448
I don't think they're gonna clean this place up,
There's just no point

318
00:31:21,437 --> 00:31:23,437
I don't think this property belongs to anybody

319
00:31:20,506 --> 00:31:21,366
I guess

320
00:31:24,344 --> 00:31:27,104
Well.. we found your barn!

321
00:31:27,479 --> 00:31:29,479
It's definitely not up

322
00:31:31,574 --> 00:31:33,574
Taking a fucking leak?

323
00:31:33,787 --> 00:31:35,787
What are you looking at?

324
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,310
Is this blood?

325
00:31:37,313 --> 00:31:38,135
Where?

326
00:31:38,949 --> 00:31:40,949
What is that?

327
00:31:41,324 --> 00:31:43,324
Let's go man!

328
00:31:44,136 --> 00:31:46,136
I don't wanna stick around here now

329
00:31:46,364 --> 00:31:47,740
That's not blood man

330
00:31:47,778 --> 00:31:49,778
Well what is it then?

331
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:56,746

343
00:33:13,384 --> 00:33:15,384

344
00:33:36,394 --> 00:33:38,394

366
00:35:32,823 --> 00:35:34,823
Hello?

367
00:35:34,902 --> 00:35:35,840
**Sigh**

368
00:36:32,014 --> 00:36:35,691
**Lightning strike!**

369
00:37:28,771 --> 00:37:31,702
**Knock! Knock!**

370
00:37:40,113 --> 00:37:43,044
**Knock! Knock!**

371
00:38:01,232 --> 00:38:03,232
Tom you up there?

372
00:38:09,495 --> 00:38:12,203
**Strange noise coming from basement**

373
00:38:27,091 --> 00:38:29,091
Tom?

374
00:38:52,467 --> 00:38:55,446
Tom you down here?

375
00:39:12,443 --> 00:39:14,532
TOM!?

376
00:39:14,802 --> 00:39:16,802
Are you ok?..
Tom?..

377
00:39:20,949 --> 00:39:22,949
911!

378
00:39:23,193 --> 00:39:26,706
**Ambulance siren**

379
00:39:51,955 --> 00:39:53,955
Tom....

380
00:39:54,634 --> 00:39:56,634
What happened to you?

381
00:39:59,995 --> 00:40:02,618
**Radio turns on**

382
00:41:09,290 --> 00:41:11,290
What am I doing?

383
00:41:12,566 --> 00:41:14,914
I gotta stop doing this.

384
00:41:15,782 --> 00:41:17,782
There's nothing here

385
00:41:17,979 --> 00:41:19,979
**Noise coming from behind**

386
00:41:49,553 --> 00:41:51,843
It's nothing,
It's gotta be nothing

387
00:41:54,181 --> 00:41:56,181
C'mon!

388
00:42:01,642 --> 00:42:03,642
OHH!!!

389
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:54,720
**Door creaking**

390
00:43:23,669 --> 00:43:25,669
**Ghostly whispers*

391
00:44:58,442 --> 00:45:05,403
**Tension building up**

392
00:45:08,620 --> 00:45:10,620
**Ghostly scream**

393
00:45:27,507 --> 00:45:30,651
THE END!!
