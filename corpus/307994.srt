God, I bet Dosto yevsky

He wrote h is no vel

00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:43,756
Th is is what we cal I S.M.A. D.

691
00:37:43,828 --> 00:37:46,729
Each letter stands
for a d ifferent type.

692
00:37:46,797 --> 00:37:50,324
S for s ocial,
M for martyrs, A for amb itious,

693
00:37:50,401 --> 00:37:52,130

N ow, I wi I I beg i n.

699
00:38:04,548 --> 00:38:08,040
A's are, of course,
amb itious, but,

00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:13,250
we're als o very creative,
i ntel I igent, v is io naries...

701
00:38:13,324 --> 00:38:16,691
usual ly CEO's, MVP's,
that type of th i ng.

702
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:20,495
Yes?

703

Yeah, u h, how d id an A I ike y ou

00:38:27,571 --> 00:38:30,165
- Man, y ou said no j okes.

00:38:31,609 --> 00:38:33,804
Yes.
I to ok the test and I'm an A.

708
00:38:33,878 --> 00:38:35,072
O h.

709
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:38,047
- May I co nti nue?
- O h, certai n ly.

710
00:38:39,216 --> 00:38:43,516
N ow, the A's usual ly fal I

The rest of y ou wi I I probab ly

Some peop le, i n I ife,

715
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:03,607
Others I ike to talk.
These are the S's.

00:39:03,674 --> 00:39:05,733
They I ike to talk
about bus i ness,

717
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:09,007
but they als o I ike to
talk about everyth i ng.

718
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,308
Talkers.

719
00:39:10,381 --> 00:39:12,941
They're not usual ly as
creative as the A's,

720
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:15,315
but if they happen to come up
with an i ntu itive idea,

721
00:39:15,386 --> 00:39:19,823
they appreciate a rou nd of app lause
and a n ice pat o n the back.

722
00:39:20,124 --> 00:39:20,783
Hey.

723
00:39:21,926 --> 00:39:24,190
That's y ou.
That's y ou, Harry.

You're not an A y ou're an S.

00:39:26,564 --> 00:39:29,055
Or actual ly y ou're an S with
an A i n fro nt and an S beh i nd it.

726
00:39:29,133 --> 00:39:31,795
- But that's y ou.
- N o, I am an A.

727
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:33,803
Harry, A's do n't
g ive these speeches.

728
00:39:33,871 --> 00:39:36,840
A's are off o n yachts s omewhere
or creati ng masterp ieces.

729
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:41,807
I'm not an A at
Bro okly n Bel I, stup id.

730
00:39:41,879 --> 00:39:44,313
I am an A of I ife.

731
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:47,449
Step back, Jack.
I'm an A.

732

I'm an ape I iv i ng

If that ai n't a v is io nary I
do n't k now what the fuck is.

734
00:39:52,656 --> 00:39:56,456
You are an A with
two S's beh i nd it.

735
00:39:56,527 --> 00:39:58,427
<i>Oh!</i>
<i>Oh, that was creativ e.</i>

736
00:39:58,496 --> 00:40:01,727
O h, u nusual for an S I ike y ou to

I thoug ht we j ust went o ver
that, y ou s i I ly I ittle S.

745
00:40:17,181 --> 00:40:18,375
I am not an S.

746
00:40:18,449 --> 00:40:20,974
S's are always
deny i ng their S-ness.

747
00:40:21,051 --> 00:40:22,780
It is imposs ib le
for me to be an S.

748
00:40:22,853 --> 00:40:25,686
I left my wife and ch i Id
to pursue my dream.

749
00:40:25,756 --> 00:40:27,519
An S wou Id never do that.

750
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:29,456
He'd j ust stand arou nd
and talk about it.

751
00:40:29,527 --> 00:40:33,054
- That is such an S's comment.
- I am not an S!

752
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:34,427
<i>Oh, what do y ou</i>

Harry Walker.

1244
01:04:43,246 --> 01:04:44,804
The lazy guy y ou work with?

1245
01:04:44,881 --> 01:04:47,679
He's not lazy.
He's j ust m is d irected.

1246
01:04:47,750 --> 01:04:49,047
Al I I k now is he

I'd say he's got a

1252
01:05:00,229 --> 01:05:02,288
He's not a very

So why is he maki ng y ou sad?

He'd take y ou to the bal I park,
