1
00:01:34,153 --> 00:01:35,514
You must sense it...

2
00:01:37,378 --> 00:01:39,140
through your body,
through your feelings...

3
00:01:40,173 --> 00:01:41,673
when your living experience...

4
00:01:41,866 --> 00:01:44,247
level after level...

5
00:01:45,831 --> 00:01:47,872
right into the heart of it.

6
00:02:02,121 --> 00:02:04,570
Any chance of getting a lesson, sir?

7
00:02:08,209 --> 00:02:09,025
Ohhh, but...

8
00:02:11,396 --> 00:02:12,689
you may not know...

9
00:02:13,871 --> 00:02:16,864
but this is a solemn and serious matter.

10
00:02:26,818 --> 00:02:28,247
Just call me Shivas.

11
00:02:31,481 --> 00:02:33,454
Go ahead, they'll understand.

12
00:02:35,506 --> 00:02:36,799
Stick your bum out.

13
00:02:37,906 --> 00:02:39,335
Keep this straight...

14
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:44,527
My name's Michael Murphy. I hope I'm not
intruding, but Shivas invited me to dinner-

15
00:02:44,665 --> 00:02:46,162
Well, now Mr. Murphy,

16
00:02:46,218 --> 00:02:48,755
you wouldn't have done that if
you didn't have a good reason.

17
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:53,047
Don't worry, the Badman often
brings his play partners her to our place.

18
00:02:53,051 --> 00:02:54,684
Peter, my wife Agatha...

19
00:02:54,687 --> 00:02:56,664
welcome to our good camp Blaithe.

20
00:02:56,693 --> 00:02:58,689
What have you done with
our unpredictable friend?

21
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,987
Me? I, uh...

22
00:03:00,039 --> 00:03:03,724
Ahh, don't tell me...he's out there waiting for the
moon to rise or communing with his higher self.

23
00:03:03,764 --> 00:03:06,064
This is Dr. Julian Lange.

24
00:03:06,089 --> 00:03:08,089
Ahh...Mr. Murphy.

25
00:03:08,114 --> 00:03:12,014
so, I hear the man brought you
through the eye of the needle?

26
00:03:12,039 --> 00:03:15,139
-Excuse me?
-Oh, he's just messing with you.

27
00:03:15,164 --> 00:03:17,164
These are the Greens...

28
00:03:17,189 --> 00:03:20,389
they've come from Cornwall to study
the ecology here at Burningbush.

29
00:03:20,414 --> 00:03:25,414
Adam, here teaches cosmic ecology
at London's free university.

30
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:28,339
And Eve teaches creative
environmental writing.

31
00:03:28,364 --> 00:03:33,864
They've got this wonderful new theory
of <i>evolution</i> and golfing links.

32
00:03:55,865 --> 00:03:58,462
I do want to hear what you
and Shamus talk about...

33
00:03:59,772 --> 00:04:03,276
I really do. I mean this
is why I'm going to India.

34
00:04:03,327 --> 00:04:04,969
I'm going to learn about this stuff.

35
00:04:06,391 --> 00:04:09,310
I hope to be a writer someday, actually.

36
00:04:09,473 --> 00:04:12,229
But right now I'm finishing
my studies in philosophy.

37
00:04:23,832 --> 00:04:24,980
I'll do it.

38
00:04:50,551 --> 00:04:52,968
This is the most famous
golf course in the world.

39
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:57,156
This is where it all began...

40
00:04:57,234 --> 00:04:59,934
I've come all the way from California.
I'm only here for the day.

41
00:05:02,392 --> 00:05:06,057
I've played Pebble my whole life, but I've
always dreamed of playing Burningbush.

42
00:05:06,082 --> 00:05:08,785
Put me with the best player on that list.

43
00:05:11,708 --> 00:05:13,108
I can match up with anyone...

44
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:16,966
if not better.

45
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:18,024
[MICHAEL] Hello.

46
00:05:18,787 --> 00:05:20,631
The starter told me to join you two.

47
00:05:30,797 --> 00:05:31,681
Shivas Irons.

48
00:05:35,331 --> 00:05:36,351
Michael Murphy.

49
00:05:37,224 --> 00:05:38,249
Balie McIver.

50
00:05:41,989 --> 00:05:45,118
Let's try a few shots for
the set up swing...

51
00:05:46,617 --> 00:05:49,678
and a few shots for
through gravity...

52
00:05:50,948 --> 00:05:53,085
and then a few to score.

53
00:06:26,746 --> 00:06:27,788
Good shot.

54
00:06:28,882 --> 00:06:31,127
How did you know to hit it there?

55
00:06:32,048 --> 00:06:34,361
That's the best line to the green.

56
00:06:35,327 --> 00:06:36,007
Just luck.

57
00:06:37,921 --> 00:06:41,509
(Shivas Singing)

58
00:06:45,994 --> 00:06:47,791
[SHIVAS] How you doin'?

59
00:06:47,825 --> 00:06:48,603
[SHIVAS] Good to see ya...

60
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:50,331
[AGATHA] Men loving men...

61
00:06:50,619 --> 00:06:52,184
that's what golf is.

62
00:06:52,932 --> 00:06:57,182
[AGATHA] It's a way you've found to get
together yet still maintain a proper distance.

63
00:06:58,985 --> 00:07:01,828
But don't get me wrong,
you're not like us women...

64
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:05,407
or Italians all hugging
embracing each other.

65
00:07:05,662 --> 00:07:07,516
You need to feel your separate love.

66
00:07:08,245 --> 00:07:09,061
Just look...

67
00:07:09,495 --> 00:07:13,181
You won't come home on time when you're with the boys.
I've learned that over the years.

68
00:07:14,329 --> 00:07:17,735
The love you feel for your
friends is too strong for that.

69
00:07:19,235 --> 00:07:21,016
And all those gentlemanly rules...

70
00:07:21,902 --> 00:07:24,318
why they're the proper rules of affection.

71
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:28,412
All the waiting and the "oohing
and aahing" over your shots...

72
00:07:28,485 --> 00:07:32,433
and this one's drive and that one's
putt and the other one's gorgeous swing...

73
00:07:32,715 --> 00:07:34,750
what is all that, but love?

74
00:07:36,017 --> 00:07:38,266
Men loving men...that's what golf is.

75
00:07:38,923 --> 00:07:41,061
I like your swing, Michael.

76
00:07:41,997 --> 00:07:47,575
Your not a professional, now are you...trying
to sneak up on us for a wee bit, eh?

77
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:50,789
Uh, just an amateur passing through.

78
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:53,219
Where are you headed?

79
00:07:53,486 --> 00:07:57,819
India...to a place you've probably
never heard of called Pondicherry.

80
00:07:59,924 --> 00:08:03,017
[SHIVAS] In the ashram of
Sri Aurobindo, perhaps?

81
00:08:04,789 --> 00:08:06,684
[MICHAEL] Oh my God, you know it.

82
00:08:07,508 --> 00:08:09,005
No one does back home.

83
00:08:09,914 --> 00:08:13,792
[SHIVAS] Nor do they here.
             Nor do they here.

84
00:08:15,082 --> 00:08:16,032
Let's tee it up..

85
00:08:19,253 --> 00:08:21,308
Any chance of getting a lesson, sir?

86
00:08:24,808 --> 00:08:25,976
Oh, but...

87
00:08:28,245 --> 00:08:29,742
you may not know...

88
00:08:30,664 --> 00:08:33,589
but this is a solemn and serious matter.

89
00:08:42,527 --> 00:08:44,320
And just call me Shivas.

90
00:08:57,455 --> 00:09:00,448
Alright...2 or 3 birdies on the par fives...

91
00:09:00,633 --> 00:09:02,198
maybe 1 or 2 more...

92
00:09:04,358 --> 00:09:06,943
that should give me a shot at a 72.

93
00:09:06,981 --> 00:09:07,933
If not better.

94
00:09:14,998 --> 00:09:17,291
Just hold on now there, Michael.

95
00:09:18,243 --> 00:09:19,318
Wait your turn.

96
00:09:36,744 --> 00:09:41,760
I propose that we all take a turn
describing the game of golf.

97
00:09:41,882 --> 00:09:43,175
Each one telling...

98
00:09:43,609 --> 00:09:47,895
exactly what this endlessly
mysterious game is really about.

99
00:09:48,584 --> 00:09:54,936
It's time we done justice to the subject,
and this is just the crowd to do it.

100
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:55,460
Now...

101
00:09:55,638 --> 00:09:58,750
Michael, you will remember it all...

102
00:09:59,481 --> 00:10:00,637
for posterity.

103
00:10:01,652 --> 00:10:03,982
Peter, your the host...begin.

104
00:10:04,051 --> 00:10:06,538
No, Agatha is.
This is her party.

105
00:10:06,991 --> 00:10:09,196
Well, then Agatha...begin.

106
00:10:09,298 --> 00:10:11,815
Nope, Peter's the one with the ideas.

107
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:13,251
Well, then, Peter...

108
00:10:13,698 --> 00:10:16,837
You'll not be gettin' any fancy theories from me.

109
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:19,131
And I'll keep my speech short.

110
00:10:22,187 --> 00:10:26,813
I'm saying my farewell to the game...
I've suffered enough with it.

111
00:10:27,642 --> 00:10:29,683
I'd like to propose a toast...

112
00:10:30,221 --> 00:10:32,398
To Peter's imminent departure...

113
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:35,148
and his predictable return.

114
00:10:36,389 --> 00:10:38,057
Predictable return.

115
00:10:39,401 --> 00:10:41,578
-Bring everybody luck.
-Okay...

116
00:10:43,216 --> 00:10:44,713
We do this, you see...

117
00:10:44,778 --> 00:10:47,023
every time I give up the game.

118
00:10:47,449 --> 00:10:49,242
[EXCLAIMING]

119
00:10:51,541 --> 00:10:53,269
What was your score, laddie?

120
00:10:55,016 --> 00:10:58,619
Don't bother...I'll keep my own score.
You have your lesson.

121
00:11:00,211 --> 00:11:00,911
I insist.

122
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:05,750
Um...

123
00:11:06,769 --> 00:11:08,130
a 4 on the 1st...

124
00:11:09,909 --> 00:11:12,536
and a 6 on the 2nd
with that damned bunker.

125
00:11:12,984 --> 00:11:15,093
[SHIVAS] You had a 5 on the 1st.

126
00:11:19,477 --> 00:11:23,082
You must count that one
that you knocked off the tee.

127
00:11:24,169 --> 00:11:25,870
When you had your waggle.

128
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:29,996
So, a 5 and a 6, then?

129
00:11:34,782 --> 00:11:36,006
[SHIVAS] Michael...

130
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:39,219
you have to remember...

131
00:11:41,043 --> 00:11:46,081
you're in the land where
all these rules were invented.

132
00:11:47,892 --> 00:11:51,021
'Tis the only way you can play in the Kingdom.

133
00:11:56,009 --> 00:11:59,352
You must count that one
that you knocked off the tee.

134
00:12:02,935 --> 00:12:04,704
When you took your waggle.

135
00:12:13,231 --> 00:12:16,582
Can I hit another?
I think that one might be lost.

136
00:12:16,725 --> 00:12:18,154
[SHIVAS] No, not here.

137
00:12:19,401 --> 00:12:22,400
[SHIVAS] You can find it in that particular lot.

138
00:12:30,267 --> 00:12:31,900
[SHIVAS] How does it lie?

139
00:12:34,544 --> 00:12:36,517
[MICHAEL] It fell into a Wynn.

140
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:39,043
Should I play it or drop out?

141
00:12:40,454 --> 00:12:43,353
[SHIVAS] No, play it as it lies.

142
00:12:44,855 --> 00:12:47,168
[SHIVAS] Always play it as it lies.

143
00:12:47,828 --> 00:12:50,141
[SHIVAS] It'll come out eventually.

144
00:12:54,326 --> 00:12:58,396
[MICHAEL] Play it as it lies...
always play it as it lies.

145
00:12:59,526 --> 00:13:02,723
[MICHAEL](under breath) Holy crap.
[SHIVAS] Huh?

146
00:13:06,621 --> 00:13:10,451
[MICHAEL] I can't even see the damned thing!
I should drop out.

147
00:13:10,794 --> 00:13:14,195
[SHIVAS] Bring me a bouquet
when you come out, yeah?

148
00:13:18,068 --> 00:13:21,401
[SHIVAS] Keep choppin'...
it'll come out eventually.

149
00:13:33,105 --> 00:13:34,738
[MICHAEL] 4 on the 1st...

150
00:13:36,864 --> 00:13:37,952
6 on the 2nd.

151
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:39,444
That damned bunker.

152
00:13:39,509 --> 00:13:42,590
You must count that one that you knocked
off the tee when you took your waggle.

153
00:13:43,893 --> 00:13:45,948
when you took your waggle.

154
00:13:53,131 --> 00:13:55,172
You're makin' a great mistake...

155
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:57,803
if you think the game...

156
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:00,121
is meant for the shot.

157
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,681
The game is meant for <i>walking</i>.

158
00:14:09,637 --> 00:14:11,066
Old man Key, there...

159
00:14:12,246 --> 00:14:13,607
he showed us how.

160
00:14:15,623 --> 00:14:16,371
With him...

161
00:14:18,185 --> 00:14:23,175
you get the spirit in yourself
to learn to enjoy every step.

162
00:14:25,086 --> 00:14:28,147
I played with him once.
He was 90 years old...

163
00:14:29,683 --> 00:14:31,588
and I'll never forget it.

164
00:14:32,829 --> 00:14:35,197
He sometimes forgot his shots...

165
00:14:35,587 --> 00:14:38,568
the walkin' got to be so good.

166
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,664
That's impossible.

167
00:14:41,066 --> 00:14:44,944
He said he learned to walk
like that from an Indian Yogi...

168
00:14:44,972 --> 00:14:46,128
in the 1880's.

169
00:14:46,447 --> 00:14:48,760
He went on a walk with the Yogi...

170
00:14:49,058 --> 00:14:50,487
in the Himalayas.

171
00:14:51,026 --> 00:14:52,727
And he never got over it.

172
00:14:55,168 --> 00:14:57,073
He said "A walk like that...

173
00:14:57,221 --> 00:15:00,554
was as good for your
soul as a day in church."

174
00:15:00,976 --> 00:15:05,955
And that was somethin' comin' from him
because he was a good Presbyterian.

175
00:15:12,208 --> 00:15:15,813
Noticed you didn't pay much
attention to the walkin'.

176
00:15:18,317 --> 00:15:19,541
I pay attention...

177
00:15:23,508 --> 00:15:24,801
to my next shot.

178
00:15:28,315 --> 00:15:30,016
[SHIVAS] That's too bad...

179
00:15:30,843 --> 00:15:32,476
not enough people do.

180
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:35,589
It's a shame.

181
00:15:37,265 --> 00:15:39,258
A rotten shame.

182
00:15:41,966 --> 00:15:44,415
Because if you can enjoy the walk...

183
00:15:47,051 --> 00:15:51,065
then perhaps you can enjoy
the other times in your life...

184
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,529
when you're in between.

185
00:15:58,459 --> 00:16:00,364
And that's most of the time.

186
00:16:01,536 --> 00:16:02,692
Couldn't you say?

187
00:16:12,019 --> 00:16:16,101
Michael, just try using your
short irons to finish the hole.

188
00:16:42,986 --> 00:16:47,544
[PETER] First an foremost, we must
all agree it's a mysterious game.

189
00:16:48,206 --> 00:16:51,812
[MICHAEL] You're up.
[PETER] Absurd, on the face of it...

190
00:16:51,881 --> 00:16:55,622
[PETER]...a distraction from
more worthwhile activities.

191
00:16:56,547 --> 00:16:59,268
[PETER] A game, supposedly. A recreation.

192
00:17:00,258 --> 00:17:02,775
[PETER] But 'tis a place of suffering.

193
00:17:02,946 --> 00:17:05,463
[MICHAEL] May I put down another ball?

194
00:17:06,812 --> 00:17:11,434
[PETER] A place that makes a man naked.
An X-ray on the soul.

195
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:51,900
[SHIVAS] Now try willing it in . It'll never
get there in the regular course of things.

196
00:18:09,197 --> 00:18:11,646
[SHIVAS] Shamus McDuff, as all of you know...

197
00:18:12,782 --> 00:18:15,163
is the man who invented golf ...

198
00:18:16,334 --> 00:18:17,899
all those years ago.

199
00:18:18,946 --> 00:18:24,243
[MICHAEL] He invented golf...that's
[SHIVAS] Invented golf. He's working on it still.

200
00:18:24,306 --> 00:18:30,693
[SHIVAS] And he's blessing Burningbush
by choosing to do his special work <i>here</i>, Peter.

201
00:18:30,727 --> 00:18:35,217
Don't be bringing Shamus McDuff
into this...I can't stand the man.

202
00:18:36,256 --> 00:18:40,066
[SHIVAS] Come on, Peter, Shamus
is our great good friend.

203
00:18:40,074 --> 00:18:41,188
[MICHAEL] Who's Shamus McDuff?

204
00:18:41,213 --> 00:18:43,213
[EVE] Shamus McDuff is the local madman.

205
00:18:43,258 --> 00:18:46,795
[ADAM] Or a very wise man,
depending on your point of view.

206
00:18:46,841 --> 00:18:49,222
[PETER] He's a royal pain in the ass.

207
00:18:49,902 --> 00:18:55,532
Why the city ever consented to let him live in
that ravine off the 13th green, I'll never know.

208
00:18:55,595 --> 00:18:57,801
[MICHAEL] He lives in the ravine?

209
00:18:57,889 --> 00:19:02,013
[SHIVAS] Let's just say he spends a
good deal of his precious time there.

210
00:19:02,094 --> 00:19:06,325
He's constantly studying the
game, working on his theories.

211
00:19:07,402 --> 00:19:08,992
[MICHAEL] What kind of theories?

212
00:19:09,098 --> 00:19:14,405
[LANGE] Well, apparently he's studying gravity...
something he now calls <i>true gravity</i>.

213
00:19:14,952 --> 00:19:19,052
[LANGE] His theory explains the
alignment of human consciousness...

214
00:19:19,121 --> 00:19:22,114
with the physical forces of the universe.

215
00:19:22,274 --> 00:19:24,158
[MICHAEL] So he's a mathematician?

216
00:19:24,222 --> 00:19:30,518
[SHIVAS] In the Pythagorean tradition..
I mean, basically he's had to tip the balance of his mind.

217
00:19:31,174 --> 00:19:33,147
in order to study gravity.

218
00:19:34,196 --> 00:19:42,405
You see, he's floating free now so that
he can get a better <i>fix</i> upon this world of ours.

219
00:19:43,754 --> 00:19:47,206
[HOWLING]
[WHISTLING]

220
00:19:48,902 --> 00:19:52,235
[SHIVAS] How would you like to meet Shamus McDuff?

221
00:19:52,769 --> 00:19:57,688
Come, let us call upon him in the midnight hour.

222
00:20:04,629 --> 00:20:08,638
[SHIVAS] There are animals
here...all <i>sorts</i> of animals.

223
00:20:11,997 --> 00:20:15,603
[HIGH PITCHED HOWLING]
[MICHAEL] What was that?

224
00:20:17,774 --> 00:20:22,386
[HOWLING CONTINUES]
[SHIVAS] That's a Banshee.

225
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:27,153
[HOWLING CONTINUES]
[SHIVAS] Don't worry. That's just a wee one.

226
00:20:38,707 --> 00:20:41,223
[MICHAEL] Shivas--You wait up?

227
00:20:44,398 --> 00:20:45,442
Shivas!!

228
00:20:52,038 --> 00:20:55,393
[SHIVAS] Michael, where the hell are ya?

229
00:20:56,824 --> 00:20:58,976
[MICHAEL] Something grabbed me down there.

230
00:21:00,482 --> 00:21:01,656
[SHIVAS] Michael...

231
00:21:03,833 --> 00:21:05,466
That's just how it felt.

232
00:21:07,965 --> 00:21:11,196
[SHIVAS] 'Twas a Banshee. They're harmless...

233
00:21:12,075 --> 00:21:13,640
completely harmless.

234
00:21:14,472 --> 00:21:16,409
Except when they're not.

235
00:21:24,545 --> 00:21:30,011
[SHIVAS YELLING]

236
00:21:34,941 --> 00:21:36,595
[MICHAEL] What are you looking for?

237
00:21:36,651 --> 00:21:38,838
[SHIVAS] What do you think?

238
00:21:41,945 --> 00:21:44,326
[SHRIEKING]
[MICHAEL] Jesus Christ!

239
00:21:44,409 --> 00:21:46,254
[SHIVAS] What in the hell is wrong with you now?

240
00:21:46,298 --> 00:21:48,217
[MICHAEL] That sound.
What's that sound?

241
00:21:48,304 --> 00:21:50,698
[SHIVAS] It's coming from the ravine...

242
00:21:50,748 --> 00:21:53,673
it means the coming of the Northern Lights.

243
00:21:59,448 --> 00:22:04,390
[LANGE] Tomorrow he'll be telling Murphy
here, that believing in God is dangerous.

244
00:22:04,919 --> 00:22:07,708
Well, we all know he's the dangerous one.

245
00:22:08,739 --> 00:22:10,916
Oh yeah, he's the dangerous one.

246
00:22:13,276 --> 00:22:16,269
[LANGE] Wouldn't you agree with that, Murphy?

247
00:22:17,234 --> 00:22:20,911
[MICHAEL] I , I don't know.
I mean, I just met him.

248
00:23:05,319 --> 00:23:07,088
[SHIVAS] Aye, he's not here...

249
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:11,145
we'll wait a while and see if he comes.

250
00:23:17,143 --> 00:23:19,660
[MICHAEL] How long have you known him?

251
00:23:23,488 --> 00:23:28,463
[SHIVAS] Actually, I met the old man back in '45.

252
00:23:33,527 --> 00:23:36,077
I remember seeing him as a boy.

253
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:43,007
From time to time reigning
a Shetland pony around the lot.

254
00:23:51,411 --> 00:23:53,248
[SHIVAS] Aye, he's not here.

255
00:23:54,402 --> 00:23:56,721
[MICHAEL] Would you think he might be asleep?

256
00:23:56,759 --> 00:23:58,128
I mean, should we go look?

257
00:23:58,166 --> 00:23:59,322
[SHIVAS] Oh, no...

258
00:24:00,711 --> 00:24:03,160
we'd disturb him something awful.

259
00:24:05,157 --> 00:24:06,926
[SHIVAS] I know his ways...

260
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:11,537
he's not here I tell
ya, he's not here.

261
00:24:24,789 --> 00:24:28,507
[SHIVAS] He went into seclusion in the 30's...

262
00:24:28,553 --> 00:24:30,594
most figured he'd gone mad.

263
00:24:33,299 --> 00:24:35,952
And then one day I was home on leave...

264
00:24:36,654 --> 00:24:42,302
for no apparent reason I was
drawn to the old burial ground next to the cathedral.

265
00:24:44,285 --> 00:24:49,806
And there he was, standing in front
of the tomb of Old Tom Morris.

266
00:24:52,339 --> 00:24:53,972
Said he was expecting me...

267
00:24:54,644 --> 00:24:56,957
said he<i> knew</i> that I'd be there.

268
00:25:01,648 --> 00:25:05,866
This was just 2 weeks after the
bomb was dropped on Hiroshima.

269
00:25:07,253 --> 00:25:09,702
"The beginning of the end," he said.

270
00:25:11,844 --> 00:25:16,629
"The final sign Man must discover his soul..."

271
00:25:18,222 --> 00:25:20,943
"...or go the way of the dying species..."

272
00:25:21,306 --> 00:25:24,503
"...down into the darkest night without end..."

273
00:25:25,525 --> 00:25:28,314
"...evolution has taken an awful turn..."

274
00:25:28,915 --> 00:25:32,679
"...and we've not much time
to right the balance."

275
00:25:35,865 --> 00:25:40,769
"You and I have much to do." he said...

276
00:25:42,308 --> 00:25:44,971
"...for these are our final days."

277
00:25:47,338 --> 00:25:51,071
"We <i>must</i> make golf a
matter of life and death."

278
00:25:53,575 --> 00:25:56,772
Of course, our collaboration
began immediately.

279
00:26:01,703 --> 00:26:03,598
[MICHAEL] Where do you think he went?

280
00:26:03,892 --> 00:26:08,977
[SHIVAS] Oh...he has other
places he goes on occasion.

281
00:26:11,034 --> 00:26:12,939
He loves to work at night...

282
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:15,871
says he can<i> feel </i> better...

283
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,145
the things he's studying.

284
00:26:19,128 --> 00:26:20,489
[MICHAEL] <i>Feel</i>  them?

285
00:26:21,266 --> 00:26:22,682
[SHIVAS] Feel them.

286
00:26:24,983 --> 00:26:26,188
So they say...

287
00:26:40,181 --> 00:26:42,766
[BALIE] Michael, what'd you have then?

288
00:26:43,762 --> 00:26:47,269
[MICHAEL] Just give me an "X."
I'm not counting that hole.

289
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:50,244
[BALIE] An "X?"

290
00:26:52,943 --> 00:26:54,440
[MICHAEL] Give me a 10.

291
00:26:58,441 --> 00:27:01,106
[SHIVAS] I think it was 11, Michael.

292
00:27:03,963 --> 00:27:06,863
[MICHAEL] Alright...11.

293
00:27:10,989 --> 00:27:12,338
[SHIVAS] Michael...

294
00:27:14,108 --> 00:27:16,829
don't worry so much about your score.

295
00:27:18,032 --> 00:27:19,937
It's not the important thing.

296
00:27:29,519 --> 00:27:31,787
[MICHAEL] Not the important thing.

297
00:27:32,451 --> 00:27:35,104
[MICHAEL] Score not the important thing?

298
00:27:35,586 --> 00:27:37,763
While they watch me like<i> hawks</i>.

299
00:27:43,437 --> 00:27:45,886
[MICHAEL] Hit the shot. Hit the shot.

300
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:48,832
Hit the shot. Hit the<i> damn</i> shot.

301
00:27:51,514 --> 00:27:53,691
[MICHAEL] I'll show these guys...

302
00:28:07,239 --> 00:28:10,640
[SHIVAS AND BILLY] Come on, Michael, you can do it.

303
00:28:11,978 --> 00:28:14,835
[SHIVAS] Oh, very good. That's a good, see.

304
00:28:15,749 --> 00:28:20,103
[PETER] Some days I love those links.
And other days I hate them.

305
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:22,785
And it's always different, depending on my mood.

306
00:28:22,824 --> 00:28:26,361
[ADAM] My lovely first and totally original wife, Eve.

307
00:28:26,389 --> 00:28:28,974
[TOGETHER] We were made for each other.

308
00:28:29,037 --> 00:28:31,701
[SHIVAS] Golf...it's like marriage...

309
00:28:33,898 --> 00:28:35,832
like marriage, golf is.

310
00:28:37,987 --> 00:28:44,144
[SHIVAS] Aye, a good marriage is as rare, and
complex, and fragile as the world itself.

311
00:28:44,921 --> 00:28:47,427
And very like the game of golf.

312
00:28:47,533 --> 00:28:49,370
[PETER] Golf and marriage...

313
00:28:50,405 --> 00:28:54,894
both demand a steadfast
purpose and imagination.

314
00:28:56,023 --> 00:28:59,791
Persistent will, and a willingness to change.

315
00:29:00,459 --> 00:29:04,155
Long shorts and a gentle stroke.

316
00:29:04,370 --> 00:29:07,401
A deft touch and the occasional gamble.

317
00:29:08,544 --> 00:29:11,821
Steady nerves and a certain wild streak.

318
00:29:12,943 --> 00:29:17,365
And it all has to come together
or the whole thing goes kaflooey.

319
00:29:25,447 --> 00:29:27,896
[MICHAEL] I can match up with anyone.

320
00:29:28,874 --> 00:29:30,847
Put me with the<i> best</i>  player.

321
00:29:31,794 --> 00:29:33,631
I can match up with <i>anyone</i>.

322
00:29:34,385 --> 00:29:36,472
I can match up with <i>anyone</i>.
If not better.

323
00:29:37,768 --> 00:29:39,469
[SHIVAS] You try too hard.

324
00:29:39,627 --> 00:29:41,146
I can match up with <i>anyone</i>.

325
00:29:41,194 --> 00:29:43,031
[SHIVAS] You think too much.

326
00:29:43,358 --> 00:29:44,476
If not better.

327
00:29:44,613 --> 00:29:45,565
If not better.

328
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:48,817
[SHIVAS] Why don't you go with your lovely swing...

329
00:29:49,408 --> 00:29:52,265
and let the nothingness into your shot?

330
00:30:25,095 --> 00:30:29,611
[SHIVAS] Oh, look, there's Jimmy.
Jimmy Tumner, how are you?

331
00:30:31,215 --> 00:30:32,848
[SHIVAS] Nice to see you.

332
00:30:33,654 --> 00:30:36,171
[SHIVAS] See you got the new ones, eh?

333
00:30:36,787 --> 00:30:41,091
[SHIVAS] That's nice, eh?
You mind if we do a bit of practice here, Jimmy?

334
00:30:41,197 --> 00:30:44,354
[SHIVAS] Good man, good man.
Take out your driver, there.

335
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:46,257
That's it...

336
00:30:48,733 --> 00:30:51,128
feet apart, there, that's good.

337
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:54,422
Just stand on the one leg...

338
00:30:56,321 --> 00:30:59,057
that's it. One leg.
Now get the leg up, up at the back.

339
00:30:59,214 --> 00:31:00,779
Put the arms forward...

340
00:31:01,287 --> 00:31:02,171
that's it.

341
00:31:02,754 --> 00:31:05,734
No, keep that up, up, up
that's it, that's good.

342
00:31:06,588 --> 00:31:09,445
[SHIVAS] Don't take it so seriously, Billy.

343
00:31:09,706 --> 00:31:12,585
You take it awful serious,
now have a wee breath.

344
00:31:12,681 --> 00:31:14,926
Close your eyes, close your eyes.

345
00:31:18,009 --> 00:31:21,138
[BALIE] Come ride me dame, come tell me dame...

346
00:31:21,401 --> 00:31:23,578
oh dame come tell me truly...

347
00:31:24,112 --> 00:31:27,037
what length of grace when we get home...

348
00:31:27,447 --> 00:31:29,148
would sour women duly.

349
00:31:29,689 --> 00:31:30,845
It is, my dear...

350
00:31:32,422 --> 00:31:33,715
the ear you fear...

351
00:31:36,096 --> 00:31:37,797
I fit you to a hear...

352
00:31:38,808 --> 00:31:40,169
I cleave it up...

353
00:31:40,871 --> 00:31:42,232
I hit you down...

354
00:31:42,741 --> 00:31:44,238
water for it fared.

355
00:31:51,650 --> 00:31:54,235
[BALIE] I learnt a song in Annandale...

356
00:31:54,695 --> 00:31:57,719
thy natch will please a lady.

357
00:32:01,141 --> 00:32:02,865
The ox in my plow...

358
00:32:03,286 --> 00:32:06,497
he beckoned never a plowed ground...

359
00:32:07,085 --> 00:32:11,614
the foremost ox is long and small...

360
00:32:12,488 --> 00:32:16,075
the two are plump and round...

361
00:32:17,565 --> 00:32:21,622
[BALIE] But weary for they throbbed up
and may the never be thrivin'...

362
00:32:22,603 --> 00:32:25,596
it's not the length that makes her dub...

363
00:32:25,643 --> 00:32:27,684
but it's the dubba drivin'.

364
00:32:28,055 --> 00:32:31,455
And he with speed, the yoke his plow...

365
00:32:32,970 --> 00:32:35,215
which by a gourd was driven...

366
00:32:37,451 --> 00:32:40,172
but when he went between my stilts...

367
00:32:42,747 --> 00:32:44,995
I thought I was in heaven.

368
00:33:20,516 --> 00:33:25,248
[LANGE] Shamus McDuff is the
one sane man amongst us here.

369
00:33:25,582 --> 00:33:30,841
He is , in fact, the<i> only
</i> sane man amongst us here.

370
00:33:32,541 --> 00:33:40,561
[LANGE] His mind may seem a little off-kilter,
that's because this world of ours has gotten off its axis

371
00:33:41,097 --> 00:33:43,546
He's just re-adjusting his sights...

372
00:33:43,989 --> 00:33:48,922
I mean, can any of us here
say we're doing any better?

373
00:33:57,626 --> 00:33:58,307
Shamus...

374
00:33:59,251 --> 00:34:02,380
taught me everything I know about the game.

375
00:34:04,057 --> 00:34:05,952
He is my truest teacher.

376
00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:29,211
[SHIVAS] How would you
like to see his weapon?

377
00:34:44,896 --> 00:34:46,052
[SHIVAS] Shamus...

378
00:34:46,971 --> 00:34:49,352
he calls this his baffid spoon.

379
00:34:51,126 --> 00:34:54,119
It's a name he remembers from his childhood.

380
00:34:55,406 --> 00:35:01,406
Shamus says "You only need one stick to play
the game." But this is no ordinary stick.

381
00:35:02,964 --> 00:35:03,712
And this...

382
00:35:05,134 --> 00:35:06,427
is his feathery.

383
00:35:07,997 --> 00:35:09,902
He found it in the ravine...

384
00:35:11,329 --> 00:35:13,436
this is the real McCoy.

385
00:35:15,284 --> 00:35:17,768
Made from feathers and leather.

386
00:35:18,406 --> 00:35:20,401
And soaked in brine.

387
00:35:22,923 --> 00:35:23,875
Now you see...

388
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:26,987
you see that target?

389
00:35:27,831 --> 00:35:29,524
That target there?

390
00:35:36,543 --> 00:35:37,592
Watch this...

391
00:35:40,891 --> 00:35:44,632
Sometimes you think the ball
will just never come down.

392
00:35:44,650 --> 00:35:46,419
You ever had that feelin'?

393
00:36:04,796 --> 00:36:06,769
[MICHAEL] Shivas, there he is.

394
00:36:06,874 --> 00:36:08,098
Look, there he is.

395
00:36:08,349 --> 00:36:12,572
[SHIVAS]...know to hit it there?
That's the best line to the green.

396
00:36:12,647 --> 00:36:15,572
[SHIVAS] Where?
[MICHAEL] Right there, look.

397
00:36:16,122 --> 00:36:19,363
[SHIVAS] I don't see him.
Where are you pointin' I don't see him at all.

398
00:36:19,408 --> 00:36:21,245
[MICHAEL] Look, right there.

399
00:37:04,232 --> 00:37:08,495
[ADAM] Golf re-capitulates evolution.

400
00:37:08,931 --> 00:37:12,846
'Tis a microcosm of the world...

401
00:37:13,172 --> 00:37:17,280
a projection of all of our hopes and fears.

402
00:37:17,627 --> 00:37:21,435
Take our love of the balls flight...

403
00:37:21,628 --> 00:37:25,059
the sight of it hanging there in space...

404
00:37:25,437 --> 00:37:29,435
anticipates our desire for transcendence.

405
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:37,214
The thrill of seeing it fly over the land, over
obstacles, especially over a stretch of water...

406
00:37:37,258 --> 00:37:39,231
and then onto the green...

407
00:37:40,445 --> 00:37:42,007
and into the hole.

408
00:37:42,998 --> 00:37:47,421
Ahh...that's a mystical quality...

409
00:37:48,087 --> 00:37:51,556
There is something in us,
something in all of us...

410
00:37:52,196 --> 00:37:53,965
that loves that flight.

411
00:37:54,122 --> 00:37:56,920
[EVE] The flight of the alone to the alone.

412
00:37:57,862 --> 00:38:00,175
[SHIVAS] That's the sound we want.

413
00:38:00,486 --> 00:38:02,760
[EVE] The flight of the alone to the alone.

414
00:38:16,161 --> 00:38:18,406
[MICHAEL] I think I saw something...

415
00:38:19,006 --> 00:38:21,620
but it must have been a trick
of the retina, with the sun--

416
00:38:21,764 --> 00:38:23,261
[SHIVAS] No, Michael...

417
00:38:24,617 --> 00:38:29,939
you think it's a trick of the retina
you're just one step away from seein' things.

418
00:38:30,304 --> 00:38:31,801
[SHIVAS] Keep swingin'.

419
00:38:38,991 --> 00:38:43,261
[SHIVAS] I want you...to try something...

420
00:38:43,945 --> 00:38:44,788
for me.

421
00:38:48,486 --> 00:38:50,051
[SHIVAS] Will you do it?

422
00:38:59,094 --> 00:39:00,318
[SHIVAS] Alright...

423
00:39:05,128 --> 00:39:06,489
when you swing...

424
00:39:08,375 --> 00:39:11,232
I want you to put all your attention...

425
00:39:11,549 --> 00:39:13,332
on your inner body.

426
00:39:17,982 --> 00:39:19,513
Your inner body.

427
00:39:23,150 --> 00:39:25,246
Feel your inner body.

428
00:39:34,611 --> 00:39:35,774
That's it...

429
00:39:42,966 --> 00:39:44,667
Close your eyes, Michael.

430
00:39:45,761 --> 00:39:47,340
Close your eyes.

431
00:40:26,437 --> 00:40:29,898
[SHIVAS] Ok, that's enough...
remember that feelin'.

432
00:40:31,341 --> 00:40:33,518
<i>Remember</i>  that feelin', Michael.

433
00:40:35,926 --> 00:40:38,254
Your inner body is waiting...

434
00:40:39,305 --> 00:40:40,802
for your attention.

435
00:40:44,943 --> 00:40:47,729
[ADAM] Have you ever pondered the mystery of the hole?

436
00:40:47,810 --> 00:40:48,647
Have you?

437
00:40:49,638 --> 00:40:53,718
Come on, what are its past
and future connotations?

438
00:40:55,768 --> 00:40:57,424
And a hole in one...

439
00:40:57,549 --> 00:41:00,094
[LANGE] You shouldn't encourage
him with this kind of thinking.

440
00:41:00,139 --> 00:41:01,996
[ADAM] Have you ever thought about that?

441
00:41:02,123 --> 00:41:03,798
[LANGE] What was it?

442
00:41:04,313 --> 00:41:07,759
The flight of the alone to the alone?

443
00:41:09,914 --> 00:41:15,977
[LANGE] I mean, seriously, are you equating your average
golfer with the ancient philosopher Plotinus?

444
00:41:16,038 --> 00:41:18,537
[ADAM] It's so, so real.

445
00:41:18,693 --> 00:41:21,455
[EVE] We know in our souls
what we are meant to be...

446
00:41:22,028 --> 00:41:26,450
so we are attracted by any
glimpse of greater possibilities.

447
00:41:27,065 --> 00:41:30,330
[ADAM] There are moments in every golfers game...

448
00:41:30,370 --> 00:41:33,785
where he or she feels this
marvelous state of mind...

449
00:41:33,929 --> 00:41:40,553
where the conflict of matter
and mind, body and spirit...

450
00:41:40,834 --> 00:41:41,922
are resolved.

451
00:41:48,564 --> 00:41:52,850
[SHIVAS] Sometimes you think the
ball will just never come down.

452
00:41:53,085 --> 00:41:53,969
[MICHAEL] Yes!

453
00:41:54,499 --> 00:41:58,671
[EVE] Where flesh helps soul no
less than soul helps flesh.

454
00:41:58,890 --> 00:42:06,038
[ADAM] And now with all the great
technological advances in balls and clubs...

455
00:42:06,139 --> 00:42:07,159
and courses.

456
00:42:07,185 --> 00:42:12,248
Well, golf is becoming an even better
vehicle for training the higher capacities.

457
00:42:12,289 --> 00:42:16,756
All signals that it is becoming
the yoga of the super-mind.

458
00:42:17,179 --> 00:42:20,376
It's the ultimate discipline for transcendence.

459
00:42:23,161 --> 00:42:28,244
[LANGE] There are signals of the damned
along with signals of <i>transcendence</i>.

460
00:42:28,319 --> 00:42:32,265
Look, you can see any damned
signals you want in the game.

461
00:42:34,057 --> 00:42:40,242
Now, see how spellbound we are
with the warden around us.

462
00:42:40,540 --> 00:42:43,465
Hypnotized from morning till night by the...

463
00:42:44,187 --> 00:42:49,532
influence human or otherwise,
that impinges on our senses.

464
00:42:50,011 --> 00:42:55,615
Every theory you propose about the
evolution of the game I will show you...

465
00:42:56,092 --> 00:43:00,014
How the game is fading
away, losing its charm.

466
00:43:00,061 --> 00:43:05,101
Being mechanized by the Americans and the
rest of the world that blindly follow them.

467
00:43:05,102 --> 00:43:07,007
Look at the crowded links...

468
00:43:08,674 --> 00:43:10,171
the lack of leisure...

469
00:43:11,737 --> 00:43:13,957
hurried starting times...come on.

470
00:43:14,698 --> 00:43:22,428
I've seen twisted lives twist our
bodies into making distorted swings.

471
00:43:23,914 --> 00:43:27,860
And how the electric carts, how
they've <i>ruined</i>  our courses...

472
00:43:29,087 --> 00:43:31,641
and robbed us of our exercise.

473
00:43:32,644 --> 00:43:36,385
How the desire for greener
greens has polluted the land.

474
00:43:37,186 --> 00:43:41,289
Now where is the <i>evolution</i> in all that?

475
00:43:42,951 --> 00:43:46,386
We're all hypnotized, I tell you.

476
00:43:46,858 --> 00:43:49,375
You're just refusing to see the fact.

477
00:43:50,022 --> 00:43:54,546
We all sit here just
getting high on whiskey.

478
00:43:54,941 --> 00:43:58,870
Painting glorious pictures on the meaning of golf...

479
00:44:01,272 --> 00:44:05,901
The world outside grows ever darker.

480
00:44:20,927 --> 00:44:22,737
[SHIVAS] What are you thinkin'?

481
00:44:23,319 --> 00:44:24,680
[MICHAEL] I blew it.

482
00:44:26,474 --> 00:44:28,890
[Michael] I used the wrong <i> damned</i>  club.

483
00:44:29,265 --> 00:44:33,211
[SHIVAS] Those thoughts will
pass-- if you don't fight them.

484
00:44:33,297 --> 00:44:34,862
[SHIVAS] Wait them out.

485
00:44:35,837 --> 00:44:39,783
[SHIVAS] I expect you heard
that from your Indian teacher?

486
00:44:43,208 --> 00:44:47,671
[AGATHA] I think the loss of love in
the world is Julian's real despair.

487
00:44:47,776 --> 00:44:50,497
Whatever his philosophizing tells him...

488
00:44:50,611 --> 00:44:54,829
he misses the leisurely pace when
there was time for affection.

489
00:44:54,851 --> 00:44:56,395
Time for reflection.

490
00:44:57,632 --> 00:44:58,731
I miss it too.

491
00:44:59,830 --> 00:45:01,735
We hurry through our days...

492
00:45:25,030 --> 00:45:27,139
[SHIVAS] What are you thinkin'?

493
00:45:30,387 --> 00:45:32,972
[SHIVAS] Tell me what you're thinkin'.

494
00:45:35,992 --> 00:45:38,734
[MICHAEL] This inner body stuff-- it can't last.

495
00:45:39,822 --> 00:45:41,384
It came too easily.

496
00:45:43,935 --> 00:45:50,026
Isn't all this talk of inner bodies and subtle
energies just a device for helping concentration?

497
00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:54,141
[SHIVAS] There are two Michaels I see...

498
00:45:54,924 --> 00:45:57,634
Michael the plunger...

499
00:45:58,291 --> 00:46:00,391
and Michael the doubter.

500
00:46:01,449 --> 00:46:04,782
You can't sit there for more than five minutes...

501
00:46:04,998 --> 00:46:08,202
without your good mind interrupting you.

502
00:46:08,897 --> 00:46:11,482
Watch out for your good mind, Michael.

503
00:46:12,069 --> 00:46:16,371
[MICHAEL] Still, I think any change
in routine would force better concentration.

504
00:46:19,992 --> 00:46:25,073
[MICHAEL] I mean, don't you think Shamus might
be a little<i> off</i>  living in this ungodly ravine?

505
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:33,095
[SHIVAS] I can see by the way you're talkin'
that the world is not yet ready for Shamus.

506
00:46:33,874 --> 00:46:36,459
[SHIVAS] To swing the man's baffid spoon...

507
00:46:37,739 --> 00:46:39,780
and still to question the man?

508
00:46:47,234 --> 00:46:50,453
[MICHAEL] I guess it doesn't
matter what I think, right?

509
00:46:50,791 --> 00:46:54,995
As long as I feel it. It's the experience
that's the important thing, right?

510
00:47:02,829 --> 00:47:07,341
I mean, look, Shamus is obviously an
incredible person whether he's mad or not.

511
00:47:07,412 --> 00:47:09,657
[SHIVAS] Whether he's mad or not?

512
00:47:09,705 --> 00:47:11,542
It's your world that's mad.

513
00:47:12,197 --> 00:47:13,173
Young man.

514
00:47:13,910 --> 00:47:16,362
Let's go. I can see this has been a mistake.

515
00:47:16,427 --> 00:47:18,768
[MICHAEL] Wait, no. Please...

516
00:47:18,810 --> 00:47:22,055
Please, Shivas. Let's
wait for Shamus.

517
00:47:33,817 --> 00:47:39,055
[SHIVAS] Get off your knees.
You look like you're gonna ask me to marry you.

518
00:48:03,336 --> 00:48:06,588
[MICHAEL] I do want to hear
what you and Shamus talk about.

519
00:48:07,329 --> 00:48:08,309
I really do.

520
00:48:08,678 --> 00:48:11,327
[SHIVAS] The world is not ready yet for Shamus.

521
00:48:11,365 --> 00:48:15,637
[MICHAEL] Yeah, but I'm different.
I mean, this is why I'm going to India to learn about this stuff.

522
00:48:15,731 --> 00:48:18,022
[SHIVAS] The world wasn't
ready for Pythagoras, either.

523
00:48:18,066 --> 00:48:19,414
Pythagoras had the clue.

524
00:48:19,515 --> 00:48:21,333
[MICHAEL] I know all about Pythagoras.

525
00:48:21,516 --> 00:48:26,278
[SHIVAS] You know what you've read
in your books in your fancy school.

526
00:48:38,274 --> 00:48:42,002
[SHIVAS] The world should have
taken its lead from Pythagoras.

527
00:48:43,264 --> 00:48:48,590
To know the world from the
inside, not the outside, as we do.

528
00:48:49,073 --> 00:48:51,998
Like I showed you in the golf shots, there.

529
00:48:55,192 --> 00:48:56,586
True gravity...

530
00:48:58,466 --> 00:49:03,645
that's Shamus' term for the
deeper lanes of forces...

531
00:49:04,944 --> 00:49:07,733
for the deeper structure of the universe.

532
00:49:09,041 --> 00:49:10,061
But this is it.

533
00:49:11,332 --> 00:49:13,931
You have to live into it, yourself.

534
00:49:16,376 --> 00:49:22,628
You can't poke it and shove it the way they
do in the universities and your laboratories...

535
00:49:24,203 --> 00:49:27,060
You must get right into the heart of it...

536
00:49:29,195 --> 00:49:30,607
You must sense it...

537
00:49:32,652 --> 00:49:35,577
through your body, through your feelings...

538
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:39,137
through your living experience, level after level...

539
00:49:41,167 --> 00:49:43,004
right into the heart of it.

540
00:49:44,457 --> 00:49:49,015
And that's why you won't see me giving any
tips to your golf swings, and these...

541
00:49:49,335 --> 00:49:52,000
how-to books. I won't do it.

542
00:49:52,044 --> 00:49:56,375
Because you have to start from inside yourself.

543
00:49:57,001 --> 00:49:58,294
Like I showed you..

544
00:49:58,627 --> 00:50:02,719
[SHIVAS] Here Michael...swing from your inside.

545
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:08,962
Go on, from your inner body, Michael.

546
00:50:30,069 --> 00:50:31,770
[SHIVAS] Close your eyes.

547
00:50:42,833 --> 00:50:45,622
Let all your power come from your center.

548
00:50:48,213 --> 00:50:49,181
That's it.

549
00:50:52,215 --> 00:50:53,546
Good.

550
00:51:22,233 --> 00:51:26,751
[AGATHA] Golf is for smellin'
heather and cut grass...

551
00:51:28,755 --> 00:51:31,136
and walking across the countryside.

552
00:51:33,715 --> 00:51:35,416
It's for feelin' the wind...

553
00:51:36,326 --> 00:51:37,959
watchin' the sun go down

554
00:51:39,778 --> 00:51:44,608
It's noticing the splendor of this
good world with every step you take.

555
00:51:46,593 --> 00:51:49,724
[SHIVAS] Good day, chaps...good day.

556
00:51:52,145 --> 00:51:53,506
[SHIVAS] You know...

557
00:51:58,306 --> 00:52:02,274
I've often wondered what it would
be like to play the course...

558
00:52:02,642 --> 00:52:03,935
with the old spoon.

559
00:52:04,772 --> 00:52:08,548
I've often been tempted...
when he's not around.

560
00:52:14,933 --> 00:52:16,294
Why don't we did it?

561
00:52:17,710 --> 00:52:22,083
[MICHAEL] What, you mean now, in the dark?
[SHIVAS] Right now...with one of the featheries.

562
00:52:22,102 --> 00:52:24,211
[MICHAEL] What if we lose them?

563
00:52:29,558 --> 00:52:32,279
[SHIVAS] That's what scares me about it.

564
00:52:52,442 --> 00:52:55,503
[SHIVAS] Do you think that we should do this?

565
00:52:55,784 --> 00:52:58,573
[MICHAEL] Well, I'm not. That's for sure.

566
00:53:02,306 --> 00:53:04,755
[SHIVAS] I think you might be right.

567
00:53:27,052 --> 00:53:28,821
SHIVAS] What do you think?

568
00:53:29,283 --> 00:53:32,048
[MICHAEL] What would Shamus do if you lose the ball?

569
00:53:32,099 --> 00:53:34,072
[SHIVAS] It's not an offer...

570
00:53:36,301 --> 00:53:37,594
What do you think?!

571
00:53:38,917 --> 00:53:41,910
[MICHAEL] Like I said...I'm not hitting any.

572
00:53:45,025 --> 00:53:48,113
[SHIVAS] You go first, I'll
take my line from your shot.

573
00:53:48,176 --> 00:53:49,605
[MICHAEL] No, not me.

574
00:53:49,658 --> 00:53:51,482
[SHIVAS] I'll take my line from your shot.

575
00:53:51,588 --> 00:53:56,700
[SHIVAS BELLOWING]

576
00:53:59,884 --> 00:54:03,762
[SHIVAS] Here, Michael, go.
It'll do you the world of good.

577
00:54:03,826 --> 00:54:04,526
Come on.

578
00:54:04,928 --> 00:54:06,689
Come on, try just once.

579
00:54:07,710 --> 00:54:08,653
Just once.

580
00:54:09,757 --> 00:54:10,581
Just one.

581
00:54:20,612 --> 00:54:21,962
I did it!

582
00:54:22,650 --> 00:54:24,287
I did it!

583
00:54:24,691 --> 00:54:26,596
The old baffin spoon did it!

584
00:54:27,283 --> 00:54:28,732
Yeah!

585
00:54:29,363 --> 00:54:31,132
Come on, come on, come on.

586
00:54:33,478 --> 00:54:35,655
[MICHAEL] Did you see something?

587
00:54:40,487 --> 00:54:41,848
[SHIVAS] You see it?

588
00:54:43,478 --> 00:54:47,077
[MICHAEL] Maybe it fell in the gorse.
[SHIVAS] I don't see it.

589
00:54:49,109 --> 00:54:52,782
[SHIVAS] I hit it over the
green if I hit it anywhere.

590
00:54:58,411 --> 00:55:01,370
[SHIVAS] Oh God...I'll be damned.

591
00:55:03,133 --> 00:55:04,494
[SHIVAS] You see it?

592
00:55:05,488 --> 00:55:08,659
MICHAEL] Shivas...it's in the cup!

593
00:55:10,124 --> 00:55:13,237
Shivas, it's here. It's in the hole!

594
00:55:13,519 --> 00:55:15,016
You got a hole-in-one!

595
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:17,116
[SHIVAS EXCLAIMS]

596
00:55:35,902 --> 00:55:39,575
[SHIVAS] I never had a
hole-in-one on the 13th before.

597
00:55:47,972 --> 00:55:48,924
Saved my life.

598
00:55:50,288 --> 00:55:52,193
The old spoon saved my life.

599
00:57:22,791 --> 00:57:25,648
[SHIVAS] They're coming from over there...

600
00:57:27,610 --> 00:57:28,698
from the church.

601
00:57:41,154 --> 00:57:47,783
And also, inside of you.

602
00:58:10,358 --> 00:58:17,099
[BALIE] A 77 for Mr. Irons, an 84 for
myself, and for wee lad here--an 86.

603
00:58:17,473 --> 00:58:21,146
And Michael, you had a 34
coming in--same as Mr. Irons...

604
00:58:21,409 --> 00:58:25,213
which just proves that true
gravity works on this plane too.

605
00:58:25,251 --> 00:58:26,612
[MICHAEL] Thank you.

606
00:58:30,902 --> 00:58:33,283
[SHIVAS] See you in the bar, Balie?

607
00:58:43,009 --> 00:58:44,756
[MICHAEL] Can I at least go in Shamus' cave?

608
00:58:44,794 --> 00:58:48,836
[SHIVAS] No. It's as cursed to
strangers as King Tut's tomb.

609
00:58:49,625 --> 00:58:51,734
You might not survive it, Michael.

610
00:59:16,882 --> 00:59:19,976
[SHIVAS] Michael...what you could yell?

611
00:59:21,227 --> 00:59:22,043
Like this...

612
00:59:23,271 --> 00:59:28,834
[SHIVAS YELLING]

613
00:59:32,763 --> 00:59:34,600
[SHIVAS] Try it, just once.

614
00:59:40,163 --> 00:59:41,319
[MICHAEL YELLING]

615
00:59:44,445 --> 00:59:52,932
[SHIVAS] Michael, best way to kill a dragon
is to run right up to it and shove a spear down its throat.

616
01:00:00,085 --> 01:00:05,047
[MICHAEL YELLING]
[SHIVAS YELLING]

617
01:00:25,655 --> 01:00:28,372
[MICHAEL] You seem to know a
lot about Indian philosophy...

618
01:00:29,750 --> 01:00:32,131
you ever thought about going there?

619
01:00:33,763 --> 01:00:34,987
[SHIVAS] To India?

620
01:00:36,746 --> 01:00:37,508
No.

621
01:00:41,394 --> 01:00:43,237
Are you asking me to go with ya?

622
01:00:43,675 --> 01:00:45,104
[MICHAEL] No, I uh...

623
01:00:47,406 --> 01:00:50,580
I was just wondering if you
ever felt the call to go there.

624
01:00:53,496 --> 01:00:56,285
I mean, you're not your typical golf pro.

625
01:00:58,063 --> 01:01:01,668
[SHIVAS] Do you think I
belong in an ashram, Michael?

626
01:01:05,060 --> 01:01:09,260
Do you think I'm like a regular
dues-paying yogi, do ya?

627
01:01:11,015 --> 01:01:13,814
[MICHAEL] Well, yes. Yes, I do.

628
01:01:17,355 --> 01:01:18,898
[SHIVAS] Listen...

629
01:01:28,902 --> 01:01:32,652
Burningbush is my ashram...aye?

630
01:01:34,512 --> 01:01:36,417
And the best place for me...

631
01:01:37,388 --> 01:01:38,344
to practice.

632
01:01:39,846 --> 01:01:41,871
What we glimpsed tonight...

633
01:01:45,038 --> 01:01:47,623
to give something back to the world...

634
01:01:50,970 --> 01:01:55,656
If it's freedom you want, Michael...

635
01:01:57,969 --> 01:02:00,146
if it's freedom that you love...

636
01:02:03,561 --> 01:02:06,079
the whole world can be your ashram.

637
01:02:14,366 --> 01:02:17,397
Let's get some tea, yeah?

638
01:02:46,863 --> 01:02:49,757
[MICHAEL] I'm actually hoping
to be a writer one day.

639
01:02:49,813 --> 01:02:52,550
But right now I'm finishing
up my studies in philosophy.

640
01:02:52,624 --> 01:02:56,434
[LANGE] Well then Murphy, as
an aspiring man of words...

641
01:02:56,688 --> 01:02:59,069
would you tell me whether they have a future?

642
01:02:59,328 --> 01:03:01,097
They've had a dismal past.

643
01:03:07,828 --> 01:03:12,005
[SHIVAS] I do have some...writings. But they're...

644
01:03:13,049 --> 01:03:16,642
they're daft...they're funny writings.

645
01:03:16,696 --> 01:03:19,645
[MICHAEL] I'd love to see anything you've written.
[SHIVAS] No, no, no.

646
01:03:19,766 --> 01:03:22,462
[SHIVAS] They wouldn't be as
polished as you would be used to.

647
01:03:22,513 --> 01:03:23,512
[MICHAEL] I don't care...

648
01:03:23,568 --> 01:03:26,305
[SHIVAS] Nobody's ever seen
them--only Julian and Shamus.

649
01:03:27,932 --> 01:03:29,497
[SHIVAS] Here they are.

650
01:03:33,861 --> 01:03:35,466
[SHIVAS] What do you think?

651
01:03:36,342 --> 01:03:37,977
[MICHAEL] Well, I have to read them first.

652
01:03:38,021 --> 01:03:39,077
[SHIVAS] Of course.

653
01:03:49,707 --> 01:03:51,975
[MICHAEL] Golf is an exercise in perspective...

654
01:03:54,019 --> 01:03:56,074
every shot requires...

655
01:03:57,762 --> 01:04:00,075
that you estimate where you are...

656
01:04:00,391 --> 01:04:02,160
in relation to the target.

657
01:04:04,846 --> 01:04:06,955
Enough golf springs you free...

658
01:04:09,298 --> 01:04:10,318
Free from what?

659
01:04:15,538 --> 01:04:18,582
[SHIVAS] From your attachment to any point.

660
01:04:22,639 --> 01:04:24,633
Somewhere in your brain...

661
01:04:26,491 --> 01:04:29,303
it senses the relativity of things.

662
01:04:34,908 --> 01:04:37,076
Keep askin' the questions, Michael...

663
01:04:37,808 --> 01:04:38,945
The best ones...

664
01:04:39,645 --> 01:04:40,938
don't have answers.

665
01:05:16,096 --> 01:05:18,332
[SHIVAS] Sit, you need a rest.

666
01:05:50,346 --> 01:05:55,535
[SHIVAS] A recipe from Afghanistan.
Brought here by my friends in the Blackwatch.

667
01:06:25,233 --> 01:06:27,410
[SHIVAS] My place of meditation.

668
01:06:44,049 --> 01:06:47,518
[MICHAEL] You know, I have an early train to catch.

669
01:06:53,110 --> 01:06:54,675
How far is the station?

670
01:08:31,072 --> 01:08:32,971
[MICHAEL] Sorry Shivas, I can't stay.

671
01:08:42,198 --> 01:08:43,354
[MICHAEL] Shivas!

672
01:09:14,063 --> 01:09:15,219
[MICHAEL] Shivas!

673
01:09:35,250 --> 01:09:36,080
[MICHAEL] Shivas!

674
01:09:53,222 --> 01:09:54,378
[MICHAEL] Shivas!

675
01:10:01,248 --> 01:10:03,017
[MICHAEL] Shivas, wake up!

676
01:10:04,108 --> 01:10:07,441
[MICHAEL] Shivas, come on, wake up!
Hey, wake up!

677
01:10:41,308 --> 01:10:42,470
Help!

678
01:10:43,564 --> 01:10:44,689
Help!

679
01:11:11,062 --> 01:11:12,456
Somebody's dying!

680
01:11:19,055 --> 01:11:19,867
[MICHAEL] Hello?

681
01:11:19,967 --> 01:11:24,117
[WOMAN] We're havin' a wee bit
of trouble love, just hold on.

682
01:11:25,776 --> 01:11:27,588
[MAN] Hi, what is it?

683
01:11:27,926 --> 01:11:29,763
[MICHAEL] Somebody's dying!

684
01:11:30,284 --> 01:11:31,852
[MAN] Well, what is he dying of, son?

685
01:11:31,972 --> 01:11:35,333
[MICHAEL] I don't know.
Look, I don't know!

686
01:11:37,884 --> 01:11:38,784
[SHIVAS] Michael.

687
01:11:38,903 --> 01:11:39,772
[MICHAEL] Oh God!

688
01:11:39,873 --> 01:11:41,254
[SHIVAS] Tell the I'm fine.

689
01:11:42,407 --> 01:11:43,488
Tell the I'm fine.

690
01:11:44,148 --> 01:11:45,229
[MICHAEL] You scared me.

691
01:11:46,065 --> 01:11:48,310
[MAN] Are you still there? Hello?

692
01:11:49,604 --> 01:11:51,101
[MICHAEL] I'm sorry...

693
01:11:51,788 --> 01:11:53,217
everything's alright.

694
01:11:56,979 --> 01:11:59,088
[SHIVAS] Have I been gone long?

695
01:12:02,406 --> 01:12:03,680
[MICHAEL] I don't know...

696
01:12:04,975 --> 01:12:06,676
but it felt like forever.

697
01:12:08,672 --> 01:12:11,178
[SHIVAS CHANTING]

698
01:12:11,641 --> 01:12:14,294
[MICHAEL] Shit! You scared me to death!

699
01:12:15,187 --> 01:12:18,886
[SHIVAS] Don't you know that we're
just flying here--like kites?

700
01:12:19,668 --> 01:12:22,647
Nothing more than a thread holding...

701
01:12:26,315 --> 01:12:28,220
we're all kites in that way.

702
01:12:30,756 --> 01:12:32,381
We're all kites in that way.

703
01:13:27,285 --> 01:13:29,247
[MICHAEL] I just told you everything's alright.

704
01:14:00,365 --> 01:14:01,715
[MAN] Is that Shamus McDuff?

705
01:14:01,776 --> 01:14:04,905
[WOMAN] That's Evan Tyree, the local champion.

706
01:14:05,043 --> 01:14:07,613
[WOMAN] He's just won a very
important British tournament.

707
01:14:07,707 --> 01:14:10,020
[WOMAN] He's Shivas' most famous pupil.

708
01:14:10,289 --> 01:14:11,214
[MICHAEL] Pay attention.

709
01:14:11,293 --> 01:14:14,586
[EVAN] I'll need my champions
crown if I am to speak.

710
01:14:15,555 --> 01:14:16,967
[EVAN] But I won't speak of golf.

711
01:14:17,013 --> 01:14:18,850
[LANGE] Thank God for that.

712
01:14:19,668 --> 01:14:21,641
[EVAN] I can only tell you...

713
01:14:22,258 --> 01:14:23,414
about my teacher.

714
01:14:24,133 --> 01:14:26,695
[EVAN] For it was he
who showed me the way.

715
01:14:28,097 --> 01:14:30,540
[EVAN] And taught me all
the graces of the game.

716
01:14:31,244 --> 01:14:32,719
This is why you're going to India.

717
01:14:33,084 --> 01:14:36,349
[EVAN] To hold my tempo
between par and bogey...

718
01:14:37,320 --> 01:14:40,934
But moreover, he showed me
the religion of the game.

719
01:14:40,968 --> 01:14:42,042
[SHIVAS] Religion, eh?

720
01:14:42,510 --> 01:14:45,871
[PETER] Shivas, I yield to
you to give the final word.

721
01:14:46,102 --> 01:14:48,546
[SHIVAS] I don't know
anything about the subject.

722
01:14:52,647 --> 01:14:55,098
[LANGE] Enough with these ridiculous excuses.

723
01:14:55,275 --> 01:14:57,588
[SHIVAS] It's to <i>enjoy yourself</i>...

724
01:14:57,826 --> 01:14:59,357
Enjoy yourself.

725
01:14:59,834 --> 01:15:02,928
And beware the quicksands of perfection.

726
01:15:06,190 --> 01:15:07,865
[SHIVAS] Close your eyes, Michael.

727
01:15:08,883 --> 01:15:10,089
Close your eyes.

728
01:15:27,296 --> 01:15:29,191
[SHIVAS] You fancy a drink, do ya?

729
01:15:29,467 --> 01:15:33,533
[SHIVAS] Oh, that's the mad dog.
Takes care of the course--guards the course.

730
01:15:58,932 --> 01:16:00,482
[SHIVAS] I'm against writing...

731
01:16:01,334 --> 01:16:04,665
because of the amount of books
that are already in the world.

732
01:16:08,729 --> 01:16:11,254
[SHIVAS] It's the livin' of
these things that counts...

733
01:16:11,836 --> 01:16:13,129
the livin' of them.

734
01:16:19,850 --> 01:16:22,911
[MICHAEL] Golf is an exercise in perspective.

735
01:16:24,439 --> 01:16:29,761
[MICHAEL] Every shot requires that you estimate
where you are in relation to the target.

736
01:16:31,667 --> 01:16:33,640
Enough golf springs you free.

737
01:16:38,372 --> 01:16:39,534
Free from what?

738
01:16:42,618 --> 01:16:45,042
[SHIVAS] Keep askin' the questions, Michael.

739
01:16:45,438 --> 01:16:48,573
The best ones...don't have answers.

740
01:17:02,026 --> 01:17:03,319
[SHIVAS] That's it.

741
01:19:13,021 --> 01:19:14,815
Just kites in the wind.

742
01:19:38,727 --> 01:19:39,826
Shivas Irons.

743
01:19:42,917 --> 01:19:44,166
Michael Murphy.

744
01:20:02,174 --> 01:20:04,487
[SHIVAS] That's the sound we want.
