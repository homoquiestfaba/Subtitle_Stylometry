00:09:31,873 --> 00:09:35,274
How dare you use the good China?

182
00:09:35,274 --> 00:09:36,774
Oh, the happy box.

183
00:09:37,801 --> 00:09:41,450
Are we feeling a little insecure today?

184
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:42,951
I believe the therapist said we should be a little

185
00:09:42,951 --> 00:09:44,766
less mocking in our relationship.

186
00:09:44,766 --> 00:09:46,864
Oh, was that what the therapist said?

187
00:09:46,864 --> 00:09:49,604
Well, I'm trying, it's just that there's so much

188
00:09:49,604 --> 00:09:52,037
in our marriage that calls for it.

189
00:09:52,037 --> 00:09:54,099
(clock ticking)

190
00:09:54,099 --> 00:09:56,932
Thinking of wearing your hat to work?

191
00:09:56,932 --> 00:09:59,331
Was there something specific?

192
00:09:59,331 --> 00:10:02,236
Warren, would you be very upset if I told you

193
00:10:02,236 --> 00:10:06,236
I don't wanna go on vacation with you next week?

194
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:12,764
Elizabeth, please don't do this to me again.

195
00:10:12,764 --> 00:10:14,665
I've dreamt about this trip for months.

196
00:10:14,665 --> 00:10:16,835
I've rented all the equipment, I've made the arrangements,

197
00:10:16,835 --> 00:10:18,628
please don't do this again.

198
00:10:18,628 --> 00:10:22,932
Warren, I don't care about your silly little dreams.

199
00:10:22,932 --> 00:10:25,621
Do you really expect me to go camping with you?

200
00:10:25,621 --> 00:10:27,114
Besides we're gonna need all the money

201
00:10:27,114 --> 00:10:29,439
we have for the renovations.

202
00:10:29,439 --> 00:10:31,497
This isn't going to be cheap, you know?

203
00:10:31,497 --> 00:10:33,324
What renovations?

204
00:10:33,324 --> 00:10:37,657
I have finally found the right man for this house.

205
00:10:39,506 --> 00:10:42,438
I'll make a deal with you.

206
00:10:42,438 --> 00:10:44,549
I'll agree to all this remodeling.

207
00:10:44,549 --> 00:10:46,535
If you'll just go camping with me.

208
00:10:46,535 --> 00:10:48,285
I don't make deals.

209
00:10:49,266 --> 00:10:51,849
Shouldn't you be going to work?

210
00:10:55,289 --> 00:10:59,456
(construction equipment rumbling)

211
00:11:09,714 --> 00:11:12,464
(wheels humming)

212
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:17,340
Hey! And just who do you think you are?

213
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:19,068
Oh, I own the place.

214
00:11:19,068 --> 00:11:20,585
I thought you said she lived alone.

215
00:11:20,585 --> 00:11:21,418
(cameras whirring)

216
00:11:21,418 --> 00:11:22,252
Listen, buddy, do you mind...?

217
00:11:22,252 --> 00:11:27,252
Buddy? My name is Hondo. H-O-N-D-O. All right?

218
00:11:27,417 --> 00:11:29,939
Oh, Warren, you're still here, good.

219
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:32,084
You can take Kiki to the groomers on your way in.

220
00:11:32,084 --> 00:11:34,192
Again? She was just at the groomers.

221
00:11:34,192 --> 00:11:35,264
Can't you take her?

222
00:11:35,264 --> 00:11:37,971
I think I'm gonna be a little busy today,

223
00:11:37,971 --> 00:11:39,627
or haven't you noticed?

224
00:11:39,627 --> 00:11:41,428
Elizabeth, I'm running kind of... (dog whimpers)

225
00:11:41,428 --> 00:11:43,498
I'll let daddy know you'll be late.

226
00:11:43,498 --> 00:11:44,704
Elizabeth, the dog hates me.

227
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:47,235
It's not you she hates, it's your smell.

228
00:11:47,235 --> 00:11:49,937
There. Now you smell like me. You're safe.

229
00:11:49,937 --> 00:11:51,682
Did I mention it was my birthday?

230
00:11:51,682 --> 00:11:55,138
Goodbye Warren.
(Kiki yipping)

231
00:11:55,138 --> 00:12:00,138
(cameras whirring)
(crowd talking and laughing)

232
00:12:03,629 --> 00:12:05,962
All right, Kiki, let's go.

233
00:12:09,338 --> 00:12:14,338
Kitchen, gone. Hallway, gone. Stairs, gone.

234
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,397
Waterfall. Fountain. Skylight. Yes.

235
00:12:18,449 --> 00:12:20,949
Front doors, gone. Whoa, gone.

236
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,263
Aquarium. Big. Yes.

237
00:12:27,901 --> 00:12:28,760
When can you start?

238
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:31,707
Well, as you can imagine, I'm pretty busy right now.

239
00:12:31,707 --> 00:12:33,098
How much of a deposit?

240
00:12:33,098 --> 00:12:34,181
Say 40,000?

241
00:12:39,353 --> 00:12:42,726
Bedrooms, gone. Ceiling, gone.

00:12:42,726 --> 00:12:47,726
(paper rustling)
(pens rattling)

243
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:53,520
(gasps) Well, we'll just let Warren deal with that.

244
00:12:54,758 --> 00:12:57,508
(pen scratching)

245
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:03,055
Oh, I forgot to throw this stuff out.

246
00:13:03,055 --> 00:13:05,758
Don't know why he hangs onto it, it's just junk.

247
00:13:05,758 --> 00:13:09,924

248

(phone ringing)

253
00:13:35,761 --> 00:13:38,974
Hello?
Daddy, hi, it's me.

254
00:13:38,974 --> 00:13:40,209
Hi.

255
00:13:40,209 --> 00:13:44,027
Daddy, Warren's got his own little nest egg.

256
00:13:44,027 --> 00:13:45,493
He does?

257
00:13:45,493 --> 00:13:49,553
Well, there's an army credit union account in his name.

258
00:13:49,553 --> 00:13:51,336
Can I have that?

259
00:13:51,336 --> 00:13:53,507
Oh, I don't see why not.

260
00:13:53,507 --> 00:13:56,507
Oh, thanks daddy. I love only you.

261
00:13:57,871 --> 00:14:01,419
(screaming in pain)

262
00:14:01,419 --> 00:14:02,663
Oh, and by the way, daddy,

263
00:14:02,663 --> 00:14:06,080
Warren's gonna be a little late for work.

264
00:14:08,527 --> 00:14:11,777
Just love it when things come my way.

265
00:14:14,155 --> 00:14:18,954
(check ripping)
I love that sound.

266
00:14:18,954 --> 00:14:21,488
Now that's a good girl.

267
00:14:21,488 --> 00:14:25,405
How would you like to have a mimosa with Hondo?

268
00:14:26,522 --> 00:14:27,939
Mm.
After me.

What?

You're late.
(toilet flushing)

282
00:15:28,241 --> 00:15:30,090
Didn't Elizabeth phone you, sir?

283
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:31,756
(door creaking closed)
What has that got to do

284
00:15:31,756 --> 00:15:33,731
with your not being at work on time?

285
00:15:33,731 --> 00:15:36,814
I had to take Kiki to the groomers.

286
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:43,580
What is that smell?
(V.D. sniffing)

287
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:46,288
Why do you smell like my daughter?

288
00:15:46,288 --> 00:15:48,495
Oh right, it, well...

289
00:15:48,495 --> 00:15:50,312
I figured maybe it wasn't me that you hated.

290
00:15:50,312 --> 00:15:52,159
It was just my smell.

291
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:54,401

294
00:16:04,404 --> 00:16:06,237
Now, I have 21 stores.

295
00:16:07,117 --> 00:16:08,525
Plenty of them make money.

296
00:16:08,525 --> 00:16:12,025
Yours doesn't, yours cost me. You cost me.

297
00:16:13,615 --> 00:16:16,483
Bad time to ask for a raise then, I guess.

298
00:16:16,483 --> 00:16:18,150
Oh, you sicken me.

299
00:16:19,298 --> 00:16:22,471
You have a very bad attitude boy.

300
00:16:22,471 --> 00:16:24,276
And although I've tried to hide my feelings,

301
00:16:24,276 --> 00:16:26,470
the truth is I don't like you,

302
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:27,637
but you're married to my daughter

303
00:16:27,637 --> 00:16:28,962
until she comes to her senses.

304
00:16:28,962 --> 00:16:30,914
I'm gonna have to put up with you,

305
00:16:30,914 --> 00:16:33,221
but it doesn't come free.

306
00:16:33,221 --> 00:16:36,062

310
00:16:43,572 --> 00:16:45,419

Yes they are.

What about a Fiesta?

320
00:17:33,661 --> 00:17:35,240
No thanks, I'm gonna eat in today.

321
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,328
No, for the store.

322
00:17:36,328 --> 00:17:38,609

My uncle has a mariachi band. Yeah, man.

324
00:17:40,518 --> 00:17:42,017

Can you work on that?

328
00:17:46,606 --> 00:17:47,606
Of course.

329
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:49,864

Yeah. Well this isn't the real Alaska,

384
00:20:07,803 --> 00:20:10,742
okay, you live like half an hour from here.

385
00:20:10,742 --> 00:20:13,994
Yes, but I have new, longer hours.

386
00:20:13,994 --> 00:20:16,038

388
00:20:17,365 --> 00:20:19,834
and screwing off is of major importance.

389
00:20:19,834 --> 00:20:21,910
So I should just, what, quit my job then?

390
00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:22,978
Yeah.

391
00:20:22,978 --> 00:20:26,079
Go straight to debtor's prison. Thanks very much.

392
00:20:26,079 --> 00:20:28,152
Well, speaking of which, Hondo arrived this morning,

393
00:20:28,152 --> 00:20:30,775
I'd like to thank you for that. I really needed it.

394
00:20:30,775 --> 00:20:32,595
I need the mustard too.

395
00:20:32,595 --> 00:20:33,932
Yeah. I thought I saw his entourage

396
00:20:33,932 --> 00:20:35,562
at your place this morning.

397
00:20:35,562 --> 00:20:37,484
Welcome to the club.

398
00:20:37,484 --> 00:20:39,218
How am I supposed to pay for that?

399
00:20:39,218 --> 00:20:40,361
I keep telling you, man,

400
00:20:40,361 --> 00:20:42,209
this is the nineties, you don't pay.

401
00:20:42,209 --> 00:20:44,775
You reorganize your debt.

402
00:20:44,775 --> 00:20:48,702
(water rushing)
(fire crackling)

403
00:20:48,702 --> 00:20:50,516
A bunch of us chipped in.

404
00:20:50,516 --> 00:20:52,255
Get out, who?
Well, no one.

405
00:20:52,255 --> 00:20:53,588
I just wanted you to think

406
00:20:53,588 --> 00:20:55,986
you had more friends than just me.

407
00:20:55,986 --> 00:20:59,653
(paper ripping)
All right.

408
00:21:02,546 --> 00:21:05,846
Now this is pretty much just to make me look stupid.

409
00:21:05,846 --> 00:21:07,562
Isn't that it?
Yep.

410
00:21:07,562 --> 00:21:09,482
Thank you. I think it's working.

411
00:21:09,482 --> 00:21:10,899
Oh yeah. It is.

412
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:14,253
You ever think about taking off one day?

413
00:21:14,253 --> 00:21:16,091
Just chucking it all bailing out.

414
00:21:16,091 --> 00:21:18,696
(introspective music playing)
Uh-uh.

415
00:21:18,696 --> 00:21:22,454
You know, you should come meet this new client of mine.

416
00:21:22,454 --> 00:21:24,926
Yeah.
Name is Carlisle,

417
00:21:24,926 --> 00:21:27,847
like you, right, thought he'd take off,

418
00:21:27,847 --> 00:21:28,965
chuck it all.

419
00:21:28,965 --> 00:21:31,454
So he does it and this guy makes it work

420
00:21:31,454 --> 00:21:34,287
like for almost a year, 10 months.

421
00:21:35,232 --> 00:21:38,445
All of a sudden outta the blue guy uses a credit card.

422
00:21:38,445 --> 00:21:40,146
Yeah, so he's nailed, right?

423
00:21:40,146 --> 00:21:43,940
You know? So you can go, but stuff always goes wrong.

424
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:46,043
That's why guys like me have careers.

425
00:21:46,043 --> 00:21:47,546
Is there some point you were trying to make with all this?

426
00:21:47,546 --> 00:21:51,541
Yeah, the point is we all get these feelings,

427
00:21:51,541 --> 00:21:56,541
difference is, most of us are smart enough to deny them.

428
00:21:56,817 --> 00:21:59,090
So if I were to reexamine my life now.

429
00:21:59,090 --> 00:22:03,923
Man, don't. Reexamining your life only leads to trouble.

430
00:22:04,776 --> 00:22:06,294
You know, you start doing that,

431
00:22:06,294 --> 00:22:09,099
the next thing you know, you're in a men's group.

432
00:22:09,099 --> 00:22:10,756
Yeah. You start drumming.

433
00:22:10,756 --> 00:22:13,831
No, I'm not gonna drum...
Examining your chakras.

434
00:22:13,831 --> 00:22:16,438
My advice. You keep it shallow.

435
00:22:16,438 --> 00:22:20,230
You get a couple of distractions. Do your time.

436
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:22,228
So, you see life as what? A prison term?

437
00:22:22,228 --> 00:22:23,736
Yeah, exactly.

438
00:22:23,736 --> 00:22:24,569
Yeah. Maybe you're the one

439
00:22:24,569 --> 00:22:25,685
who should get some help.

440
00:22:25,685 --> 00:22:27,080
Yeah, well maybe,

441
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:29,102
but never going to so it doesn't matter.

442
00:22:29,102 --> 00:22:30,668
How are the headaches?

443
00:22:30,668 --> 00:22:33,501
Getting worse every day.

444
00:22:34,751 --> 00:22:36,696
Two years. I'm outta here.

445
00:22:36,696 --> 00:22:39,050
Yeah, bull roar...
I'm going.

446
00:22:39,050 --> 00:22:39,883
Yeah, uh-huh.

447
00:22:39,883 --> 00:22:40,781
Which part of Alaska

448
00:22:40,781 --> 00:22:42,446
do you think Elizabeth will like best,

449
00:22:42,446 --> 00:22:44,116
the frozen wasteland part

450
00:22:44,116 --> 00:22:45,661
or the icy wilderness part?

451
00:22:45,661 --> 00:22:47,243
I'm working on that.

452
00:22:47,243 --> 00:22:48,456
I know if I can just get her up there,

453
00:22:48,456 --> 00:22:50,336
she's gonna love it. How could you not?

454
00:22:50,336 --> 00:22:51,213
See you keep looking

455
00:22:51,213 --> 00:22:53,654
for quality in a relationship. I keep trying to tell you

456
00:22:53,654 --> 00:22:55,809
the secret to a long-term relationship.

457
00:22:55,809 --> 00:22:59,339
Complete total disregard for quality.

458
00:22:59,339 --> 00:23:01,217
You know what? You get a life without surprises.

459
00:23:01,217 --> 00:23:02,343
I want surprises.

460
00:23:02,343 --> 00:23:03,737
Yeah. And you keep thinking like that

461
00:23:03,737 --> 00:23:06,261
and you're gonna end up in big trouble.

462
00:23:06,261 --> 00:23:08,076
So having a dream is stupid, then?

463
00:23:08,076 --> 00:23:09,468
Stupid. See, if you don't have any dreams,

464
00:23:09,468 --> 00:23:11,070
you can't have them dashed.

465
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:13,133
Right.
Hey, listen.

466
00:23:13,133 --> 00:23:15,084
I also got you this cellphone.

467
00:23:15,084 --> 00:23:16,950
I just didn't have time to wrap it.

468
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:18,431
From a client, right?

469
00:23:18,431 --> 00:23:19,264
So?

470
00:23:19,264 --> 00:23:20,579
Ronny?
Yeah?

471
00:23:20,579 --> 00:23:22,626
Let's stick around for a while. Come on.

472
00:23:22,626 --> 00:23:23,594
Can't man.
No?

473
00:23:23,594 --> 00:23:26,632
Nah, I have to be in court this afternoon.

474
00:23:26,632 --> 00:23:27,465
(crows cawing)
Who's the client.

475
00:23:27,465 --> 00:23:30,060
No one I'm being sued.
Hm.

476
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:32,098
Which reminds me, that phone: outgoing calls only,

477
00:23:32,098 --> 00:23:34,148
okay, if it rings don't answer it.

478
00:23:34,148 --> 00:23:36,148
Why not?
Just don't.

479
00:23:38,592 --> 00:23:42,092
(whimsical music playing)

480
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:46,825
(foot steps clicking)

481
00:23:46,825 --> 00:23:47,658
Alaska.

482
00:23:49,234 --> 00:23:50,623
Beautiful, yes?

483
00:23:50,623 --> 00:23:52,335
Yes it is.

484
00:23:52,335 --> 00:23:53,622
Yeah. I've got a place there.

485
00:23:53,622 --> 00:23:55,039
Oh yeah, where?

486
00:23:56,455 --> 00:23:58,021
Do you know Alaska?

487
00:23:58,021 --> 00:23:59,688
Every square inch.

488
00:24:00,918 --> 00:24:03,062
Well, do you know the newer sections?

489
00:24:03,062 --> 00:24:05,350
I mean, this is, this is new.

490
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:09,312
This is south Juno Heights. It's a... what?

491
00:24:09,312 --> 00:24:12,895
We've just incorporated. Growing community.

492
00:24:14,358 --> 00:24:18,525
And I thought Davey Crockett didn't lie.

493
00:24:20,058 --> 00:24:21,331
(cars hum outside)

494
00:24:21,331 --> 00:24:22,656
Diane?

495
00:24:22,656 --> 00:24:24,261
(Diane laughing)

496
00:24:24,261 --> 00:24:28,011
Diane, I didn't recognize you being so, so...

497
00:24:30,342 --> 00:24:32,425
So short?
Short? Yes.

498
00:24:33,606 --> 00:24:35,397
Yeah, good to see you.

499
00:24:35,397 --> 00:24:37,123
You too, you look terrific.

500
00:24:37,123 --> 00:24:37,956
Oh no, you...

501
00:24:37,956 --> 00:24:41,235
Look at those eyes of yours. Just the same.

502
00:24:41,235 --> 00:24:44,191
For you. I mean, you haven't changed a bit.

503
00:24:44,191 --> 00:24:45,024
Thanks.

504
00:24:48,323 --> 00:24:49,811
How long you been in town?

505
00:24:49,811 --> 00:24:51,821
A couple of weeks.
Yeah?

506
00:24:51,821 --> 00:24:53,103
Visiting then.

507
00:24:53,103 --> 00:24:54,917
No, actually my grandmother died.

508
00:24:54,917 --> 00:24:57,504
So I'm here selling the house.

509
00:24:57,504 --> 00:24:58,337
But with the market the way it is,

510
00:24:58,337 --> 00:25:00,406
I really have no idea how long I'm staying.

511
00:25:00,406 --> 00:25:02,978
You know, for your sake. I hope it doesn't sell.

512
00:25:02,978 --> 00:25:04,132
I be your pardon.

513
00:25:04,132 --> 00:25:05,420
Too quickly because you know,

514
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:08,186
you want that market turn around, could take months,

515
00:25:08,186 --> 00:25:10,944
you know, and that'd be good, you know?

516
00:25:10,944 --> 00:25:13,555
Cause I'd like to see you.
Oh.

517
00:25:13,555 --> 00:25:15,444
It's great to see you

518
00:25:15,444 --> 00:25:18,217
Who belongs to this and this?

519
00:25:18,217 --> 00:25:19,452
That would be me.

520
00:25:19,452 --> 00:25:21,344
Hi, I rented all this stuff

521
00:25:21,344 --> 00:25:23,346
and my plans have fallen through now.

522
00:25:23,346 --> 00:25:24,313
I'm not gonna be able to use it.

523
00:25:24,313 --> 00:25:25,953
I wonder if I could return it early

524
00:25:25,953 --> 00:25:27,670
and maybe get my deposit back?

525
00:25:27,670 --> 00:25:30,410
You can't do that. No early returns.

526
00:25:30,410 --> 00:25:31,777
Why.

527
00:25:31,777 --> 00:25:33,806
Store policy.

528
00:25:33,806 --> 00:25:36,808
What is that? Some sort of law or something.

529
00:25:36,808 --> 00:25:37,975
It's a rule.

530
00:25:40,042 --> 00:25:41,102
You know, it's attitudes like his

531
00:25:41,102 --> 00:25:43,303
that make our society almost impossible to live in.

532
00:25:43,303 --> 00:25:44,933
Would you call your manager please?

533
00:25:44,933 --> 00:25:48,979
(whispers) Diane...
I am the manager.

534
00:25:48,979 --> 00:25:51,305
Just let me handle it Diane.

535
00:25:51,305 --> 00:25:53,229
Could you please cut me a little slack, okay?

536
00:25:53,229 --> 00:25:55,622
Can't you just bend the rules for once?

537
00:25:55,622 --> 00:25:57,158
No.

538
00:25:57,158 --> 00:25:59,214
Okay. All right.

539
00:25:59,214 --> 00:26:01,802
Hey, do you realize that your store is lacking

540
00:26:01,802 --> 00:26:03,723
certain fundamental requirements

541
00:26:03,723 --> 00:26:05,958
for people with disabilities?

542
00:26:05,958 --> 00:26:07,166
How would you like to explain

543
00:26:07,166 --> 00:26:11,544
why this retail store is not wheelchair friendly?

544
00:26:11,544 --> 00:26:13,997
That was the old manager, I'm the new manager

545
00:26:13,997 --> 00:26:16,703
and things are going to be different around here.

546
00:26:16,703 --> 00:26:19,092
Just, oh, look at this.

547
00:26:19,092 --> 00:26:24,092
This was filled out two weeks ago before store policy.

548
00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:26,641
It's a loophole, but I can work it for you.

549
00:26:26,641 --> 00:26:30,058
I hope you have a very nice day.

550
00:26:30,058 --> 00:26:31,058
Thank you.

551
00:26:32,211 --> 00:26:36,018
(peaceful music playing)

552
00:26:36,018 --> 00:26:38,030
Everything still looks the same. Doesn't it?

553
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:38,863
Yep.

554
00:26:40,423 --> 00:26:43,275
Diane, I gotta thank you for helping me out back there.

555
00:26:43,275 --> 00:26:45,696
What are friends for? Speaking of which,

556
00:26:45,696 --> 00:26:47,453
Do you ever see any the old gang?

557
00:26:47,453 --> 00:26:49,128
Yeah. I see Ronny,

558
00:26:49,128 --> 00:26:50,695
but everyone else moved away, like you.

559
00:26:50,695 --> 00:26:54,528
(people talking and laughing)

560
00:27:00,283 --> 00:27:02,556
(kids laughing and screaming)

561
00:27:02,556 --> 00:27:05,055
You guys wanna come over to my house to watch color TV?

562
00:27:05,055 --> 00:27:06,495
Nah, I gotta get home.

563
00:27:06,495 --> 00:27:08,022
Yeah, and I gotta go see my grandma.

564
00:27:08,022 --> 00:27:11,038
Suit yourselves, come on let's go!

565
00:27:11,038 --> 00:27:13,985
Thanks for taking me to the movies, Warren!

566
00:27:13,985 --> 00:27:16,122
That's okay, Diane, 'North to Alaska'

567
00:27:16,122 --> 00:27:18,283
is one of the greatest movies of all time.

568
00:27:18,283 --> 00:27:19,625
Yep.

569
00:27:19,625 --> 00:27:23,542
And John Wayne, he's one of the best actors in America.

570
00:27:23,542 --> 00:27:24,830
Maybe the world.

571
00:27:24,830 --> 00:27:26,956
And he knows how to take a punch.

572
00:27:26,956 --> 00:27:28,922
Alaska looks pretty good, doesn't it?

573
00:27:28,922 --> 00:27:31,085
Yeah, it looks like it could be fun.

574
00:27:31,085 --> 00:27:34,367
But what I don't get is what do the women do?

575
00:27:34,367 --> 00:27:35,654
I mean the guys look for gold,

576
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:37,160
get drunk and fight each other.

577
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:39,907
But the women just seem to walk around inside the saloon.

578
00:27:39,907 --> 00:27:41,622
It's weird. Isn't it?

579
00:27:41,622 --> 00:27:43,526
Yeah.

580
00:27:43,526 --> 00:27:45,979
We're moving away on Monday.
What?

581
00:27:45,979 --> 00:27:47,764
My dad got a job in California.

582
00:27:47,764 --> 00:27:48,779
You're kidding.

583
00:27:48,779 --> 00:27:50,533
No, I'm not.

584
00:27:50,533 --> 00:27:53,316
So I guess that means I can't go to your party next week,

585
00:27:53,316 --> 00:27:56,043
but I got you this present.

586
00:27:56,043 --> 00:27:57,293
Happy birthday.

587
00:27:59,045 --> 00:28:01,795
(paper rustling)

588
00:28:04,622 --> 00:28:07,066
It's a cowboy wallet. It didn't have any 'Warren's,

589
00:28:07,066 --> 00:28:09,205
so I got you a Davy.

590
00:28:09,205 --> 00:28:12,676
Maybe I'm gonna move back someday.

591
00:28:12,676 --> 00:28:14,793
We'll still be best friends, won't we?

592
00:28:14,793 --> 00:28:16,710
Best friends forever.

593
00:28:20,321 --> 00:28:21,821
I better get going.

594
00:28:21,821 --> 00:28:23,071
Yeah. Me too.

595
00:28:24,023 --> 00:28:25,106
Bye Diane.

596
00:28:26,516 --> 00:28:27,736
Bye, Davy.

597
00:28:27,736 --> 00:28:32,075
(sentimental music playing)

598
00:28:32,075 --> 00:28:33,742
Well, here we are.

599
00:28:39,271 --> 00:28:40,854
So Diane, I, I...

600
00:28:44,013 --> 00:28:47,433
If you don't mind, what happened?

601
00:28:47,433 --> 00:28:48,627
I fell down.

602
00:28:48,627 --> 00:28:49,963
That's it?

603
00:28:49,963 --> 00:28:52,110
Well, there are a few more specific details.

604
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:56,383
Like going off the trail and being where I shouldn't be

605
00:28:56,383 --> 00:28:58,636
pushing something too far.

606
00:28:58,636 --> 00:29:01,619
But yeah, that's basically it.

607
00:29:01,619 --> 00:29:02,580
It's funny. Isn't it?

608
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:06,061
How one little thing, one tiny event,

609
00:29:06,061 --> 00:29:08,978
and suddenly your life has changed.

610
00:29:10,926 --> 00:29:13,676
So what are you up to these days?

611
00:29:14,606 --> 00:29:18,922
Oh, I make copies and I do office printing.

612
00:29:18,922 --> 00:29:20,677
Well that's nice.

613
00:29:20,677 --> 00:29:21,889
Oh yeah.

614
00:29:21,889 --> 00:29:23,609
Do you like it?
No.

615
00:29:23,609 --> 00:29:25,276
Good. That's good.

616
00:29:26,837 --> 00:29:28,004
So...

617
00:29:31,106 --> 00:29:32,482
Are you married?

618
00:29:32,482 --> 00:29:34,649
Oh. Oh no... Me? Please.

619
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:40,836
Could you ask me that again though?

620
00:29:40,836 --> 00:29:42,136
Are you married?

621
00:29:42,136 --> 00:29:43,469
Yes. Yes I am.

622
00:29:45,736 --> 00:29:46,768
And you.

623
00:29:46,768 --> 00:29:49,851
No, I was waiting for you remember?

624
00:29:51,334 --> 00:29:53,860
Oh, right, yeah, we were gonna move to Alaska.

625
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:54,693
Geez.

626
00:29:56,712 --> 00:29:58,755
So, what do you do with your days?

627
00:29:58,755 --> 00:30:03,249
Oh, well I have a part-time job at Marco Polo Pizza.

628
00:30:03,249 --> 00:30:05,135
You should come by sometime for lunch.

629
00:30:05,135 --> 00:30:05,968
Yeah...

630
00:30:07,599 --> 00:30:08,516
Yeah, yeah.

631
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:12,448
I gotta go.

632
00:30:12,448 --> 00:30:14,685
But you know, I might do that.

633
00:30:14,685 --> 00:30:15,660
I think I'll take you up.

634
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:16,940
It'll be my treat.

635
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:17,886
You sure it's okay.

636
00:30:17,886 --> 00:30:19,469
Oh yeah. Anytime.

637
00:30:22,469 --> 00:30:23,565
Look, great seeing you.

638
00:30:23,565 --> 00:30:26,398
It's really good to see you too.

639
00:30:28,056 --> 00:30:30,166
Yeah. I never thought that we'd...

640
00:30:30,166 --> 00:30:30,999
I know.

641
00:30:33,374 --> 00:30:36,431
You know don't you wish things could've been...

642
00:30:36,431 --> 00:30:38,360
(Warren sighs)

643
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:39,777
If we would've...

644
00:30:40,657 --> 00:30:41,900
I gotta go.

645
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:43,373
I gotta go.

646
00:30:43,373 --> 00:30:45,556
Okay.
Yeah.

647
00:30:45,556 --> 00:30:46,453
Oh, Davy?

648
00:30:46,453 --> 00:30:47,596
Yeah?

649
00:30:47,596 --> 00:30:49,295
Happy birthday.

650
00:30:49,295 --> 00:30:50,213
(whimsical music playing)

651
00:30:50,213 --> 00:30:51,476
You remembered?

652
00:30:51,476 --> 00:30:53,442
Sure, I do. Of course.

653
00:30:53,442 --> 00:30:56,260
Hey, I bought you a wallet.

654
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:59,593
(Diane laughs)
Wait...

655
00:31:05,415 --> 00:31:07,082
All right, well...

656
00:31:07,924 --> 00:31:08,757
Bye.

657
00:31:10,344 --> 00:31:13,212
(Diane sighs)

658
00:31:13,212 --> 00:31:16,879
(sentimental music playing)

659
00:31:37,991 --> 00:31:42,491
(sentimental music continues playing)

660
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:49,871
(engine rumbling)

661
00:31:54,967 --> 00:31:59,467
(sentimental continues music playing)

662
00:32:10,547 --> 00:32:12,069
(lip smacking)
(Elizabeth grunts)

663
00:32:12,069 --> 00:32:13,808
(Elizabeth punches Warren)
(Warren Grunts)

664
00:32:13,808 --> 00:32:15,563
(Warren groans)

665
00:32:15,563 --> 00:32:17,689
Warren, it's only you.

666
00:32:17,689 --> 00:32:19,804
(Warren gasping for breath)

667
00:32:19,804 --> 00:32:23,341
(high pitched voice) Well, something smells good.

668
00:32:23,341 --> 00:32:26,853
Well, it should...
(Kiki barking)

669
00:32:26,853 --> 00:32:28,020
It's for Kiki.

670
00:32:31,235 --> 00:32:32,461
Here's your dinner,

671
00:32:32,461 --> 00:32:37,300
special coupon from Fong's came in the mail this morning.

672
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:39,143
Oh, if you don't want Chinese,

673
00:32:39,143 --> 00:32:40,887
there's some menus in the drawer.

674
00:32:40,887 --> 00:32:42,333
Toodles, Kiki!

675
00:32:42,333 --> 00:32:44,750
(Kiki barks)

676
00:32:47,646 --> 00:32:50,313
Relax, I'm gonna order my own.

677
00:32:52,324 --> 00:32:53,689
In our... at our age,

678
00:32:53,689 --> 00:32:56,388
you can't afford to be too careful, you know?

679
00:32:56,388 --> 00:32:57,221
(audience laughs)

680
00:32:57,221 --> 00:32:58,622
Grinders have a good start to the third.

681
00:32:58,622 --> 00:33:00,593
Now they come out with a Gretzky line

682
00:33:00,593 --> 00:33:04,319
and the Blackhawks have the Roenick line out there.

683
00:33:04,319 --> 00:33:06,477
And Russian authorities have confirmed

684
00:33:06,477 --> 00:33:10,185
that Yuri and Andre Petrovich were two ex party hardliners

685
00:33:10,185 --> 00:33:12,971
who were disillusioned with the Russian system

686
00:33:12,971 --> 00:33:15,695
and came here to start a new life.

687
00:33:15,695 --> 00:33:17,628
A life of crime.

688
00:33:17,628 --> 00:33:19,631
I'm Jesus Bonilla, reporting live.

689
00:33:19,631 --> 00:33:21,305
Excuse me, what were their names again?

690
00:33:21,305 --> 00:33:22,678
We're live.

691
00:33:22,678 --> 00:33:23,678
Oh. Sorry.

692
00:33:28,528 --> 00:33:31,111
(Warren sighs)

693
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:41,432
Why are you avoiding me?

694
00:33:41,432 --> 00:33:43,647
I'm trying to help you.

695
00:33:43,647 --> 00:33:44,480
With what?

696
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,231
[Reflection Warren] You know, your life,

697
00:33:46,231 --> 00:33:48,460
ticking clock, following your bliss,

698
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:51,175
reclaiming your backbone, being happy,

699
00:33:51,175 --> 00:33:54,181
getting back on track, serving your true self.

700
00:33:54,181 --> 00:33:56,313
Doing it. Do I need to go on?

701
00:33:56,313 --> 00:33:57,452
(water drains loudly)

702
00:33:57,452 --> 00:33:59,702
By the way, happy birthday.

703
00:34:02,378 --> 00:34:07,378
(engine rumbling)
(announcer shouting)

704
00:34:09,372 --> 00:34:14,372
(engine roaring)
(people cheering)

705
00:34:17,646 --> 00:34:21,063
(mariachi music playing)

706
00:34:24,852 --> 00:34:26,167
What do you think about it?

707
00:34:26,167 --> 00:34:28,198
This is all right.

708
00:34:28,198 --> 00:34:29,031
Hey, gimme this, will ya?

709
00:34:29,031 --> 00:34:30,379
Don't wanna scare everyone away.

710
00:34:30,379 --> 00:34:31,212
Isn't real.

711
00:34:31,212 --> 00:34:32,815
Yeah, I know, it looks real.

712
00:34:32,815 --> 00:34:35,010
I'd rather not lose the few customers we have.

713
00:34:35,010 --> 00:34:38,975
These are not customers, these are my relatives.

714
00:34:38,975 --> 00:34:40,488
(mariachi music continues playing)

715
00:34:40,488 --> 00:34:43,276
Free food. That is interesting.

716
00:34:43,276 --> 00:34:45,902
How about I get a copy machine and give away free copies?

717
00:34:45,902 --> 00:34:47,396
Absolutely right, I'm very sorry.

718
00:34:47,396 --> 00:34:48,750
It's just for today. Okay.

719
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:52,833
How much... (speaking Spanish)

720
00:34:55,659 --> 00:34:57,405
You manager here, right?

721
00:34:57,405 --> 00:34:58,607
Yes.

722
00:34:58,607 --> 00:34:59,903
Nice store.

723
00:34:59,903 --> 00:35:00,817
Thank you.

724
00:35:00,817 --> 00:35:02,436
A small peace offer.

725
00:35:02,436 --> 00:35:03,269
Huh?

726
00:35:03,269 --> 00:35:04,798
It's autographed.

727
00:35:04,798 --> 00:35:08,593
Sorry for any hardship my store is causing you.

728
00:35:08,593 --> 00:35:11,676
Oh, you're Humble Howie Hohenstein.

729
00:35:13,788 --> 00:35:14,621
Hohenstein?

730
00:35:14,621 --> 00:35:16,825
My last name used to be Ho,

731
00:35:16,825 --> 00:35:21,647
I changed it to Hohenstein, sound more American.

732
00:35:21,647 --> 00:35:24,443
Humble Howie. Catchy, uh-huh?

733
00:35:24,443 --> 00:35:25,371
Uh-huh.

734
00:35:25,371 --> 00:35:28,051
It's all in the book.

735
00:35:28,051 --> 00:35:29,531
You want some good advice?

736
00:35:29,531 --> 00:35:32,440
Please.
Take big chances.

737
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:33,787
Okay.

738
00:35:33,787 --> 00:35:36,037
Now I have to go. Ladies?

739
00:35:38,996 --> 00:35:41,746
(car door slams)

740
00:35:47,351 --> 00:35:48,184
Traitor!

741
00:35:49,493 --> 00:35:52,031
You call this Sales promotion?

742
00:35:52,031 --> 00:35:54,531
(chips crack)

743
00:35:56,423 --> 00:35:59,840
You are the saddest, sorriest, sack of...

744
00:36:01,668 --> 00:36:04,088
Thank God everything is in Elizabeth's name.

745
00:36:04,088 --> 00:36:06,472
Now you obviously can't handle this job.

746
00:36:06,472 --> 00:36:07,399
Tell you what I'm gonna do,

747
00:36:07,399 --> 00:36:08,549
I'm gonna come back here to help you.

748
00:36:08,549 --> 00:36:09,861
I'm gonna manage this store.

749
00:36:09,861 --> 00:36:11,622
And teach you what a little hard work is all about.

750
00:36:11,622 --> 00:36:14,265
(crowd muttering in English and Spanish)

751
00:36:14,265 --> 00:36:16,632
(dramatic music begins)

752
00:36:16,632 --> 00:36:19,733
Where do you think you're going?

753
00:36:19,733 --> 00:36:23,853
(crowd noises and music intensify)

754
00:36:23,853 --> 00:36:25,155
Where do you think you're going?

755
00:36:25,155 --> 00:36:26,323
Out.

756
00:36:26,323 --> 00:36:28,512
What is that supposed to mean?

757
00:36:28,512 --> 00:36:31,341
I guess it means I quit.

758
00:36:31,341 --> 00:36:33,838
You can't quit. You can't get away from me.

759
00:36:33,838 --> 00:36:36,552
(engine revs)
You can't leave me.

760
00:36:36,552 --> 00:36:38,249
(dramatic music continues)

761
00:36:38,249 --> 00:36:40,783
All right. Run. Run. RUN!

762
00:36:40,783 --> 00:36:43,700
(wheels squealing)

763
00:36:51,746 --> 00:36:55,829
(construction equipment humming)

764
00:37:01,807 --> 00:37:04,724
(hammers pounding)

765
00:37:11,210 --> 00:37:12,997
Elizabeth.

766
00:37:12,997 --> 00:37:15,261
(dramatic music playing)

767
00:37:15,261 --> 00:37:16,261
Elizabeth?

768
00:37:18,590 --> 00:37:20,285
You were doing the bathroom.

769
00:37:20,285 --> 00:37:23,082
We need to open it up a bit.

770
00:37:23,082 --> 00:37:25,574
And then a skylight.
Oh.

771
00:37:25,574 --> 00:37:27,510
Jackie was so right about you.

772
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:29,256
(groaning) I know.

773
00:37:29,256 --> 00:37:31,936
I know, well you'll love the kitchen.

774
00:37:31,936 --> 00:37:32,769
Yes!
Center island.

775
00:37:32,769 --> 00:37:33,938
Yes!
Pine floor!

776
00:37:33,938 --> 00:37:35,575
Oh, yes!
French appliances.

777
00:37:35,575 --> 00:37:38,506
Yes! Yes!
A fire place.

778
00:37:38,506 --> 00:37:40,291
Oh, yes!

779
00:37:40,291 --> 00:37:43,554
Wow! Oh God.
(thudding and grunting)

780
00:37:43,554 --> 00:37:45,787
Oh, tell me about the tile again.

781
00:37:45,787 --> 00:37:47,887
More grouting.

782
00:37:47,887 --> 00:37:48,812
Yes.

783
00:37:48,812 --> 00:37:51,270
(traffic rumbling)

784
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:53,042
Here you go. Thanks a lot.

785
00:37:53,042 --> 00:37:55,085
Okay, and he wants the pizza too, right?

786
00:37:55,085 --> 00:37:56,401
Diane!

787
00:37:56,401 --> 00:37:58,067
Warren?

788
00:37:58,067 --> 00:37:59,455
Hi. We've gotta talk.

789
00:37:59,455 --> 00:38:00,654
I'm a little busy right now.

790
00:38:00,654 --> 00:38:01,487
Yeah, I know.

791
00:38:01,487 --> 00:38:02,910
But you see, I'm changing my life

792
00:38:02,910 --> 00:38:05,121
and you are gonna be a part of it.

793
00:38:05,121 --> 00:38:06,462
I see.

794
00:38:06,462 --> 00:38:09,766
Excuse me. Gina, would you take over for me please?

795
00:38:09,766 --> 00:38:12,020
And don't forget the pepperoni pizza.

796
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:14,834
Warren, what is going on with you?

797
00:38:14,834 --> 00:38:15,900
Hi.

798
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:17,688
Hi.

799
00:38:17,688 --> 00:38:19,088
Hello?

800
00:38:19,088 --> 00:38:20,279
Hello.

801
00:38:20,279 --> 00:38:22,473
You've got the most beautiful eyes.

802
00:38:22,473 --> 00:38:24,576
Thank you. Warren what is all this

803
00:38:24,576 --> 00:38:25,639
about changing your life?

804
00:38:25,639 --> 00:38:27,695
Oh, oh right. My life.

805
00:38:27,695 --> 00:38:31,333
Pardon me, sir, could you move down one place?

806
00:38:31,333 --> 00:38:33,506
Diane, remember when you said little things

807
00:38:33,506 --> 00:38:34,981
can change the world?

808
00:38:34,981 --> 00:38:35,814
Yes.

809
00:38:35,814 --> 00:38:38,158
There've been a couple of little things lately.

810
00:38:38,158 --> 00:38:39,468
And your world has changed.

811
00:38:39,468 --> 00:38:40,755
Completely.

812
00:38:40,755 --> 00:38:41,961
Diane.

813
00:38:41,961 --> 00:38:44,088
I love you I always have.

814
00:38:44,088 --> 00:38:45,250
Now, a very successful man

815
00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:47,646
told me to take big chances.

816
00:38:47,646 --> 00:38:50,133
Will you take them with me?

817
00:38:50,133 --> 00:38:52,060
Okay. Well what exactly does that mean?

818
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:53,560
You, me, Alaska.

819
00:38:54,573 --> 00:38:56,547
Truth. Beauty, happiness.

820
00:38:56,547 --> 00:38:57,768
Well, I believe in those things.

821
00:38:57,768 --> 00:38:58,784
Great. Let's go.

822
00:38:58,784 --> 00:39:00,480
Wait... Wait a minute.

823
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:04,024
Now for one thing, I don't get off work until 10.

824
00:39:04,024 --> 00:39:09,024
And for another thing you're still married. Aren't you?

825
00:39:09,295 --> 00:39:11,161
Good point. Yeah.

826
00:39:11,161 --> 00:39:14,799
Look, Warren, ever since my accident,

827
00:39:14,799 --> 00:39:17,215
I've had this chance to rebuild a life

828
00:39:17,215 --> 00:39:22,215
and it's become very important to me to do it right.

829
00:39:22,269 --> 00:39:23,555
So, if you're suggesting...

830
00:39:23,555 --> 00:39:25,337
Oh no, no, no, no, no.

831
00:39:25,337 --> 00:39:26,337
Say no more.

832
00:39:27,325 --> 00:39:32,063
I'm just gonna take care of a few things and I'll be back.

833
00:39:32,063 --> 00:39:33,563
Don't go anywhere.

834
00:39:37,741 --> 00:39:40,908
Oh, you have the cutest little ears.

835
00:39:43,048 --> 00:39:44,450
Isn't this great?

836
00:39:44,450 --> 00:39:47,033
(diners laugh)

837
00:39:49,111 --> 00:39:50,723
I'll bet you're still tingling, aren't you?

838
00:39:50,723 --> 00:39:52,390
That was incredible.

839
00:39:53,786 --> 00:39:55,256
Elizabeth.

840
00:39:55,256 --> 00:39:57,173
Whoa.
Hey Hondo.

841
00:39:57,173 --> 00:39:59,578
Hey, you're doing a great job out there.

842
00:39:59,578 --> 00:40:00,789
Really? You think so? That's very...

843
00:40:00,789 --> 00:40:02,114
What are you doing home?

844
00:40:02,114 --> 00:40:03,123
Why aren't you at work?

845
00:40:03,123 --> 00:40:04,271
Oh, I quit.

846
00:40:04,271 --> 00:40:06,672
Which reminds me. I'd like a divorce please.

847
00:40:06,672 --> 00:40:07,639
What did you say?

848
00:40:07,639 --> 00:40:08,983
A divorce.

849
00:40:08,983 --> 00:40:10,370
Here's the thing Elizabeth.

850
00:40:10,370 --> 00:40:12,277
You and I don't make each other happy.

851
00:40:12,277 --> 00:40:14,356
Now I've got a chance to straighten out my life

852
00:40:14,356 --> 00:40:16,597
and I'm sure you don't wanna come along.

853
00:40:16,597 --> 00:40:17,953
Wow.

854
00:40:17,953 --> 00:40:18,858
Wow.

855
00:40:18,858 --> 00:40:20,994
Very direct. You're a very direct man.

856
00:40:20,994 --> 00:40:22,745
I'm very impressed with you.

857
00:40:22,745 --> 00:40:24,398
Oh, well now it's a male bonding thing.

858
00:40:24,398 --> 00:40:26,093
No, it was just a...
Wait for me downstairs.

859
00:40:26,093 --> 00:40:28,260
Go on. Go, go, go, go, go.

860
00:40:29,597 --> 00:40:33,359
Look, Mr. King of the wild frontier.

861
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:35,685
I am not going through

862
00:40:35,685 --> 00:40:38,685
the public humiliation of a divorce.

863
00:40:39,537 --> 00:40:42,874
And where do you think you're going to? Alaska?

864
00:40:42,874 --> 00:40:43,707
Yep.

865
00:40:43,707 --> 00:40:44,590
Yep.

866
00:40:44,590 --> 00:40:45,644
(Warren chuckles)

867
00:40:45,644 --> 00:40:48,227
Well not without the money you aren't

868
00:40:48,227 --> 00:40:49,655
(music becomes foreboding)

869
00:40:49,655 --> 00:40:54,655
Did you actually think you could hide that account from me?

870
00:40:55,084 --> 00:40:59,084
(Elizabeth laughing maniacally)

871
00:41:07,798 --> 00:41:11,715
(footsteps thudding on stairs)

872
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:20,320
(dramatic music continues)
(evil laughter continues)

873
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:24,914
(Warren screams)

874
00:41:24,914 --> 00:41:28,581
(collapsing buildings roar)

875
00:41:31,037 --> 00:41:33,454
(wind wails)

876
00:41:34,566 --> 00:41:39,487
If I were you I'd go beg daddy for your job back.

877
00:41:39,487 --> 00:41:43,070
(melancholy music playing)

878
00:41:45,713 --> 00:41:48,630
(ceramic shatters)

879
00:41:49,987 --> 00:41:51,570
(Elizabeth sobbing)

880
00:41:51,570 --> 00:41:53,817
How are you feeling about it?

881
00:41:53,817 --> 00:41:54,734
Terrible.

882
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:58,902
You know how awful my kitchen is?

883
00:41:58,902 --> 00:42:00,189
Yes.

884
00:42:00,189 --> 00:42:03,396
If the work stops now it'll never get done.

885
00:42:03,396 --> 00:42:06,807
Oh, I know darling, but I meant about Warren.

886
00:42:06,807 --> 00:42:09,460
Oh that well, he'll be all right.

887
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:12,210
He won't do anything. Never does.

888
00:42:16,438 --> 00:42:17,271
Biscuit.

(Warren grunts)

908
00:43:16,188 --> 00:43:17,855
You talking to me?

909
00:43:18,806 --> 00:43:21,415
I don't think so. You talking to me?

910
00:43:21,415 --> 00:43:24,498
Talking to me? Are you talking to me?

911
00:43:25,556 --> 00:43:26,639
Yeah, I am.

912
00:43:27,525 --> 00:43:29,418
I'm talking to you.

913
00:43:29,418 --> 00:43:31,036
What's with the gun?

914
00:43:31,036 --> 00:43:31,910
I'm a man, okay?

915
00:43:31,910 --> 00:43:34,399
I happen to think better with a gun around.

916
00:43:34,399 --> 00:43:35,982
It's a toy.
So?

917
00:43:38,291 --> 00:43:39,504
[Reflection Warren] And what's with the get up?

918
00:43:39,504 --> 00:43:42,255
What, did you send out to ACME bomb company?

919
00:43:42,255 --> 00:43:43,977
You should get going, you know you're free.

920
00:43:43,977 --> 00:43:46,922
You've done it. Go on, go.

921
00:43:46,922 --> 00:43:49,139
Haven't you forgot about something? Huh?

922
00:43:49,139 --> 00:43:50,408
What about the money?

923
00:43:50,408 --> 00:43:52,041
How am I gonna get my money?

924
00:43:52,041 --> 00:43:54,552
I don't think you thought about that, did you?

925
00:43:54,552 --> 00:43:55,648
You got me there.

926
00:43:55,648 --> 00:43:58,013
Okay, do you have a plan?
Maybe.

927
00:43:58,013 --> 00:43:59,674
[Reflection Warren] Maybe?
Yes. Yes I do.

928
00:43:59,674 --> 00:44:02,015
I have a plan.
All right.

929
00:44:02,015 --> 00:44:05,052
I'm all ears, Mr. Smarty pants.

930
00:44:05,052 --> 00:44:07,200
Look, pal, weren't you the one

931
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:09,470
who was telling me to get my spine back,

932
00:44:09,470 --> 00:44:11,747
to act, to get free?

933
00:44:11,747 --> 00:44:13,370
Well, you should be all choked up

934
00:44:13,370 --> 00:44:16,272
because I'm taking your advice.

935
00:44:16,272 --> 00:44:18,484
I'm getting free.

936
00:44:18,484 --> 00:44:21,441
You're in a bathroom with a plastic gun

937
00:44:21,441 --> 00:44:22,990
and you're wearing road flares.

938
00:44:22,990 --> 00:44:24,812
Yes, exactly.

939
00:44:24,812 --> 00:44:25,895
Stick around.

940
00:44:26,909 --> 00:44:27,742
Oh boy.

941
00:44:31,464 --> 00:44:33,772
Warren?.

942
00:44:33,772 --> 00:44:36,133
(Warren breathing heavily)

943
00:44:36,133 --> 00:44:37,145
(door slams)

944
00:44:37,145 --> 00:44:41,728
I wanna talk to you...
(Kiki barking)

945
00:44:45,935 --> 00:44:48,520
Kiki, what is...
(Kiki continues barking)

946
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:53,030
Warren? What have you done to my good towels?

947
00:44:53,030 --> 00:44:54,429
(Warren moaning)

948
00:44:54,429 --> 00:44:55,762
God... Warren?

949
00:44:56,659 --> 00:44:59,576
Elizabeth, listen very carefully.

950
00:45:00,493 --> 00:45:04,309
I've been taken hostage by those Russian kidnapper guys.

951
00:45:04,309 --> 00:45:05,855
The MGB ones?

952
00:45:05,855 --> 00:45:07,099
KGB.

953
00:45:07,099 --> 00:45:08,016
Whatever.

954
00:45:08,949 --> 00:45:12,826
(face slams against door)
Honey, you gotta help me.

955
00:45:12,826 --> 00:45:15,601
(Russian accent) Do exactly as you are told

956
00:45:15,601 --> 00:45:17,230
and no one gets hurt.

957
00:45:17,230 --> 00:45:18,147
Understand?

958
00:45:23,304 --> 00:45:25,373
Are you speaking to me?

959
00:45:25,373 --> 00:45:26,891
(doorbell rings)

960
00:45:26,891 --> 00:45:28,556
Oh, there's someone at the door.

961
00:45:28,556 --> 00:45:30,139
I'll be right back.

962
00:45:31,272 --> 00:45:34,867
Wait... Wait, Elizabeth.

963
00:45:34,867 --> 00:45:36,450
Elizabeth, which...

964
00:45:37,470 --> 00:45:39,536
(knocking on the door)

965
00:45:39,536 --> 00:45:40,774
Oh Jackie, thank God you're here.

966
00:45:40,774 --> 00:45:42,194
Are you okay, sweetheart?

967
00:45:42,194 --> 00:45:44,046
I just thought I'd come and check in.

968
00:45:44,046 --> 00:45:46,565
Oh, this can be so great.

969
00:45:46,565 --> 00:45:49,982
You think? Front doors gone.
Stunning.

970
00:45:51,186 --> 00:45:52,603
Skylight.
Oh.

971
00:45:53,451 --> 00:45:56,948
Staircase gone.
Oh, stunning.

972
00:45:56,948 --> 00:45:58,713
Waterfall.
Oh!

973
00:45:58,713 --> 00:46:00,710
Fountain.
Oh, I'm green.

974
00:46:00,710 --> 00:46:02,103
Bedrooms gone.
Stop.

975
00:46:02,103 --> 00:46:04,186
Ceiling gone!
Really?

976
00:46:05,031 --> 00:46:06,672
No, I think they're gonna paint that.

977
00:46:06,672 --> 00:46:08,480
And Warren's okay with all this?

978
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:09,856
Warren!
Gone?

979
00:46:09,856 --> 00:46:12,664
No, he's been kidnapped.
Where is he?

980
00:46:12,664 --> 00:46:14,768
In the bedroom!
Oh!

981
00:46:14,768 --> 00:46:16,026
(heavy knocking on the door)

982
00:46:16,026 --> 00:46:17,044
Hello?

983
00:46:17,044 --> 00:46:20,084
(Russian accent) We are wanting $50,000.

984
00:46:20,084 --> 00:46:22,385
No police or he dies.

985
00:46:22,385 --> 00:46:24,391
Are you crazy? If I had that kind of money,

986
00:46:24,391 --> 00:46:27,280
don't you think I'd have a pool?

987
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:30,445
Elizabeth, would you listen to the man please?

988
00:46:30,445 --> 00:46:32,272
Oh, hi Jackie, I didn't see you...

989
00:46:32,272 --> 00:46:36,008
Sorry, as you can see, I'm a walking time bomb.

990
00:46:36,008 --> 00:46:37,667
Now if these guys don't get what they want,

991
00:46:37,667 --> 00:46:39,917
they're gonna blow me up...

992
00:46:42,047 --> 00:46:43,481
And the house.

993
00:46:43,481 --> 00:46:44,868
THE HOUSE?

994
00:46:44,868 --> 00:46:48,379
(both screaming) They're gonna blow up the house!

995
00:46:48,379 --> 00:46:49,212
Wait...

996
00:46:49,212 --> 00:46:54,212
(women continue screaming)
(suspenseful music playing)

997
00:46:56,279 --> 00:46:58,696
(door slams)

998
00:47:02,390 --> 00:47:03,943
[Reflection Warren] One question over here,

999
00:47:03,943 --> 00:47:07,377
Mr. President, would that be your plan?

1000
00:47:07,377 --> 00:47:09,544
Yes. Yes it is.

1001
00:47:11,628 --> 00:47:13,795
What are you looking at?

1002
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:19,640
(sirens blaring)
(suspenseful music playing)

1003
00:47:26,413 --> 00:47:31,413
(car doors slamming)
(guns cocking)

1004
00:47:31,778 --> 00:47:33,227
I said no police.

1005
00:47:33,227 --> 00:47:35,793
Move it.
I can't see a thing.

1006
00:47:35,793 --> 00:47:38,376
How could she get that wrong?

1007
00:47:39,845 --> 00:47:43,678
(suspenseful music continues)

1008
00:47:54,730 --> 00:47:57,128
(music lowers in intensity)

1009
00:47:57,128 --> 00:47:59,878
(hawk screeches)

1010
00:48:02,093 --> 00:48:07,093
Wrong house! Other side!
(music intensifies)

1011
00:48:09,131 --> 00:48:14,131
(officers shout)
(guns cocking)

1012
00:48:14,261 --> 00:48:15,094
Psst...

1013
00:48:18,372 --> 00:48:20,955
(bikes rattle)

1014
00:48:23,971 --> 00:48:27,804
(suspenseful music continues)

1015
00:48:30,871 --> 00:48:33,712
See? Little stick man runs off the pad. See, there you go.

1016
00:48:33,712 --> 00:48:35,009
(women laughing)

1017
00:48:35,009 --> 00:48:38,676
Okay, all right, now, how many were there?

1018
00:48:40,499 --> 00:48:41,832
Ooh, not sure.

1019
00:48:43,235 --> 00:48:45,985
Two, three.... I think... Jackie?

1020
00:48:48,326 --> 00:48:49,858
I'm not sure.

1021
00:48:49,858 --> 00:48:51,012
Gotta go with a number,

1022
00:48:51,012 --> 00:48:52,900
either two or three, make a decision.

1023
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:53,802
Two.
Two.

1024
00:48:53,802 --> 00:48:55,020
All right, good.

1025
00:48:55,020 --> 00:48:55,875
Okay.

1026
00:48:55,875 --> 00:48:57,625
Now, were they armed?

1027
00:49:01,996 --> 00:49:03,598
Were they armed?

1028
00:49:03,598 --> 00:49:06,515
(cameras whirring)

1029
00:49:07,686 --> 00:49:08,519
I'll say yes.

1030
00:49:08,519 --> 00:49:09,468
Yes. Okay.

1031
00:49:09,468 --> 00:49:10,301
Heavily.

1032
00:49:10,301 --> 00:49:11,566
Very good. Good.

1033
00:49:11,566 --> 00:49:13,174
And they made Warren

1034
00:49:13,174 --> 00:49:15,844
wear dynamite strapped to his chest.

1035
00:49:15,844 --> 00:49:17,616
(whispers) Oh, that's nice, it's good you saw...

1036
00:49:17,616 --> 00:49:18,646
They did?
Mhmm.

1037
00:49:18,646 --> 00:49:19,479
Well, I didn't see that.

1038
00:49:19,479 --> 00:49:21,194
Oh dear.
Well, where was I?

1039
00:49:21,194 --> 00:49:24,308
Gone?
(both women laugh)

1040
00:49:24,308 --> 00:49:25,141
(Lt. Sneed sighs)

1041
00:49:25,141 --> 00:49:27,710
Dynamite. Well, I'm trained for it.

1042
00:49:27,710 --> 00:49:29,505
Well actually I'm not, but the fellows are.

1043
00:49:29,505 --> 00:49:31,072
Don't tell the fellows I'm not.

1044
00:49:31,072 --> 00:49:32,596
(laughs) my little secret.

1045
00:49:32,596 --> 00:49:36,346
All right, now did they say what they wanted?

1046
00:49:37,291 --> 00:49:40,528
Oh, $50,000.
There you go, that's it.

1047
00:49:40,528 --> 00:49:44,057
(V.D. screaming in pain)

1048
00:49:44,057 --> 00:49:45,899
Anything else that comes to mind?

1049
00:49:45,899 --> 00:49:49,649
Anything else? Any little thing you remember?

1050
00:49:52,104 --> 00:49:54,592
They said no police.

1051
00:49:54,592 --> 00:49:56,292
Well, that's good.

1052
00:49:56,292 --> 00:49:59,736
You remember that, good answer. Very good.

1053
00:49:59,736 --> 00:50:01,134
Did they say no police?

1054
00:50:01,134 --> 00:50:04,214
Well, I didn't hear that, where was I?

1055
00:50:04,214 --> 00:50:05,551
What have you been doing?

1056
00:50:05,551 --> 00:50:06,843
Are you sleeping over here?

1057
00:50:06,843 --> 00:50:08,055
Are you with us now?

1058
00:50:08,055 --> 00:50:10,114
(Elizabeth laughing)

1059
00:50:10,114 --> 00:50:11,382
(Elizabeth yelps)
(Lt. Sneed yelps back)

1060
00:50:11,382 --> 00:50:12,850
Kiki was in there somewhere.

1061
00:50:12,850 --> 00:50:14,422
Kiki your child?

1062
00:50:14,422 --> 00:50:16,076
Yes.
Oh my gosh.

1063
00:50:16,076 --> 00:50:18,077
No, my dog.
Oh, the dog.

1064
00:50:18,077 --> 00:50:19,153
They're very close.

1065
00:50:19,153 --> 00:50:20,451
Oh, well that's nice.

1066
00:50:20,451 --> 00:50:22,353
That's great. Hang on to that bond.

1067
00:50:22,353 --> 00:50:25,302
Okay, now this very important.

1068
00:50:25,302 --> 00:50:26,552
Very important.

1069
00:50:27,537 --> 00:50:29,454
Did they sound Russian?

1070
00:50:30,723 --> 00:50:35,056
(game show countdown music playing)

1071
00:50:36,753 --> 00:50:37,876
Russian...

1072
00:50:37,876 --> 00:50:40,534
Russian, Russian... I'll say yes.

1073
00:50:40,534 --> 00:50:41,514
Yes. Okay.

1074
00:50:41,514 --> 00:50:43,502
Me too.
Oh, two yes's on that.

1075
00:50:43,502 --> 00:50:45,557
Well, they're Russian then.

1076
00:50:45,557 --> 00:50:47,341
Kiki girl dog or boy dog.

1077
00:50:47,341 --> 00:50:49,213
Girl dog.
Oh, isn't that nice.

1078
00:50:49,213 --> 00:50:50,077
That's great.

1079
00:50:50,077 --> 00:50:52,422
What has this got to do with anything?

1080
00:50:52,422 --> 00:50:53,800
I was just wondering.

1081
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:55,674
When I was a little boy, I had a little boy dog,

1082
00:50:55,674 --> 00:50:57,741
a little sausage dog, Pepi. Little, wee legs.

1083
00:50:57,741 --> 00:50:59,376
I'd throw the stick and he'd run for it.

1084
00:50:59,376 --> 00:51:01,376
And that little tail would be going a mile a minute.

1085
00:51:01,376 --> 00:51:03,601
Oh, he was a cute little dog.

1086
00:51:03,601 --> 00:51:05,376
None of us saw the truck.

1087
00:51:05,376 --> 00:51:07,077
Look, I gotta go- Like to stay here,

1088
00:51:07,077 --> 00:51:08,342
but I really do have to go.

1089
00:51:08,342 --> 00:51:09,894
Oh, more questions.

1090
00:51:09,894 --> 00:51:11,287
(laughs) No, no, no more.

1091
00:51:11,287 --> 00:51:13,550
Mrs. Five, thanks so much for letting us use the kitchen.

1092
00:51:13,550 --> 00:51:16,071
You really do have a beautiful house here.

1093
00:51:16,071 --> 00:51:17,619
Thank you.

1094
00:51:17,619 --> 00:51:18,452
I did it.

1095
00:51:19,897 --> 00:51:21,128
Hondo.

1096
00:51:21,128 --> 00:51:22,331
Sneed.
Married?

1097
00:51:22,331 --> 00:51:23,262
Yeah, 13 years.

1098
00:51:23,262 --> 00:51:24,640
Good for you.
Well.

1099
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:26,435
Give this to your wife.

1100
00:51:26,435 --> 00:51:27,728
She'll know what to do.

1101
00:51:27,728 --> 00:51:30,185
She deserves it (chuckles).

1102
00:51:30,185 --> 00:51:31,018
Excuse me.

1103
00:51:31,018 --> 00:51:32,541
Certainly.
Yes?

1104
00:51:32,541 --> 00:51:36,478
This is the sorriest waste of taxpayers money

1105
00:51:36,478 --> 00:51:39,061
I have ever seen, let's attack.

1106
00:51:40,510 --> 00:51:42,084
And you are...?

1107
00:51:42,084 --> 00:51:42,917
The father.

1108
00:51:42,917 --> 00:51:44,501
Of...?

1109
00:51:44,501 --> 00:51:45,501
Elizabeth.

1110
00:51:46,345 --> 00:51:47,735
Who is...?

1111
00:51:47,735 --> 00:51:49,895
That's me.

1112
00:51:49,895 --> 00:51:52,353
Oh, I'm sorry, didn't know. Didn't put the two together.

1113
00:51:52,353 --> 00:51:53,665
Well, you're the man I need to talk to.

1114
00:51:53,665 --> 00:51:55,351
Are you willing to pay the ransom?

1115
00:51:55,351 --> 00:51:56,184
No.
Daddy!

1116
00:51:56,184 --> 00:51:58,263
What?
We need it to bait the trap.

1117
00:51:58,263 --> 00:52:00,430
Fine. Get your own bait.

1118
00:52:01,335 --> 00:52:03,740
Daddy. Don't do this to me in front of these people.

1119
00:52:03,740 --> 00:52:05,044
It's embarrassing.
NO!

1120
00:52:05,044 --> 00:52:06,877
Daddy, please.
NO!

1121
00:52:08,570 --> 00:52:10,746
Please, please.
Nice family.

1122
00:52:10,746 --> 00:52:12,196
Who wants quiche?

1123
00:52:12,196 --> 00:52:13,383
WEOB news flash I'm Monica Etheridge...

1124
00:52:13,383 --> 00:52:14,216
(intercom buzzes)

1125
00:52:14,216 --> 00:52:15,713
Mr. Fife, have you finished that file yet?

1126
00:52:15,713 --> 00:52:16,871
Working on it.

1127
00:52:16,871 --> 00:52:17,954
The latest kidnapping victim

1128
00:52:17,954 --> 00:52:21,488
has been identified as printing executive Warren Kooey.

1129
00:52:21,488 --> 00:52:23,055
I'm standing outside the Kooey home.

1130
00:52:23,055 --> 00:52:23,888
Oh geez.

1131
00:52:23,888 --> 00:52:26,342
And as you can see, it is being remodeled.

1132
00:52:26,342 --> 00:52:30,081
We will speak to the contractor in just a few moments.

1133
00:52:30,081 --> 00:52:33,855
(suspenseful music playing)

1134
00:52:33,855 --> 00:52:38,272
(feedback whines)
Can you hear me?

1135
00:52:39,225 --> 00:52:41,431
Testing, testing...
(feedback continues)

1136
00:52:41,431 --> 00:52:45,431
(words inaudible over feedback)

1137
00:52:50,443 --> 00:52:52,882
If you people think I'm gonna give you any money,

1138
00:52:52,882 --> 00:52:54,356
you're sadly mistaken.

1139
00:52:54,356 --> 00:52:55,731
Don't say that... give me that.

1140
00:52:55,731 --> 00:52:56,860
(metallic bang)

1141
00:52:56,860 --> 00:52:59,443
(Warren sighs)

1142
00:53:01,686 --> 00:53:03,508
(grunting)
I'll do the negotiating.

1143
00:53:03,508 --> 00:53:07,445
(hands slam on metal)

1144
00:53:07,445 --> 00:53:09,897
What have I gotten myself into?

1145
00:53:09,897 --> 00:53:11,998
Oh, this is is just great.

1146
00:53:11,998 --> 00:53:14,713
What's gonna happen next?
I have no idea.

1147
00:53:14,713 --> 00:53:18,126
You said you had a plan.
I did.

1148
00:53:18,126 --> 00:53:20,459
I did say that I had a plan,

1149
00:53:21,581 --> 00:53:26,352
but I realize now that that was a bit premature.

1150
00:53:26,352 --> 00:53:29,993
I said I had a plan, but it was really more of an idea.

1151
00:53:29,993 --> 00:53:31,845
So, you don't have a next move?

1152
00:53:31,845 --> 00:53:33,803
Uh-uh.
(sirens wailing)

1153
00:53:33,803 --> 00:53:36,470
(phone ringing)

1154
00:53:42,626 --> 00:53:43,459
Hello?

1155
00:53:45,111 --> 00:53:47,543
Mr. Kooey? Sneed here.

1156
00:53:47,543 --> 00:53:49,011
I'm with the police department.

1157
00:53:49,011 --> 00:53:52,178
I just want to apologize about all the confusion here.

1158
00:53:52,178 --> 00:53:54,461
There's been a lot of cutbacks, a lot of guys that are...

1159
00:53:54,461 --> 00:53:55,991
Well, look, I don't wanna bore you with that.

1160
00:53:55,991 --> 00:53:59,209
I was just wondering how you were.

1161
00:53:59,209 --> 00:54:01,594
Can you talk?
Sure.

1162
00:54:01,594 --> 00:54:02,946
You know, not for too long.

1163
00:54:02,946 --> 00:54:04,839
Oh, sure, I understand.

1164
00:54:04,839 --> 00:54:07,831
Oh, can you hang on for a second?

1165
00:54:07,831 --> 00:54:09,474
Can I try these?

1166
00:54:09,474 --> 00:54:10,711
(over the phone) delicious!

1167
00:54:10,711 --> 00:54:11,878
I'm on hold.

1168
00:54:13,307 --> 00:54:15,400
I'll take one of these guys. That's fun.

1169
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:16,233
Look.

1170
00:54:18,866 --> 00:54:20,214
Hello?

1171
00:54:20,214 --> 00:54:21,701
Sorry. I'm back.

1172
00:54:21,701 --> 00:54:22,534
I'm back.

1173
00:54:24,258 --> 00:54:25,971
(Warren grunts and breathes heavily)

1174
00:54:25,971 --> 00:54:27,851
(Russian accent) Listen, Mr. Policeman,

1175
00:54:27,851 --> 00:54:31,265
we grow very weary of your stalling.

1176
00:54:31,265 --> 00:54:33,703
Perhaps we should blow things up.

1177
00:54:33,703 --> 00:54:37,227
No, no, no, no need to do that.

1178
00:54:37,227 --> 00:54:39,334
Maybe I'll have one more.

1179
00:54:39,334 --> 00:54:40,839
These are really... Woo, I'll try...

1180
00:54:40,839 --> 00:54:43,186
Oh, try one of the swords.

1181
00:54:43,186 --> 00:54:44,353
These are fun.

1182
00:54:45,419 --> 00:54:46,252
Delicious.

1183
00:54:46,252 --> 00:54:49,029
You're welcome, there's plenty more where that came from.

1184
00:54:49,029 --> 00:54:50,226
It's really good.

1185
00:54:50,226 --> 00:54:51,575
(with mouth full) Sorry about that.

1186
00:54:51,575 --> 00:54:53,122
Look, we're trying to get the money.

1187
00:54:53,122 --> 00:54:55,298
It's just taking a little longer than we thought,

1188
00:54:55,298 --> 00:54:56,737
you're gonna have to give us till tomorrow.

1189
00:54:56,737 --> 00:54:59,154
Tomorrow, noon. If not, BOOM!

1190
00:55:01,253 --> 00:55:03,076
(phone rings)

1191
00:55:03,076 --> 00:55:04,326
Marco Polo's.

1192
00:55:05,335 --> 00:55:07,649
Hang on a sec. Diane, it's for you.

1193
00:55:07,649 --> 00:55:09,019
Line one.

1194
00:55:09,019 --> 00:55:12,420
David Crockett?
(sentimental music begins)

1195
00:55:12,420 --> 00:55:14,714
Warren, are you all right?

1196
00:55:14,714 --> 00:55:16,896
Oh, I'm fine. I'm fine.

1197
00:55:16,896 --> 00:55:20,146
Diane, did I tell you that I loved you?

1198
00:55:21,033 --> 00:55:21,866
Sort of.

1199
00:55:21,866 --> 00:55:23,770
Did you say that you loved me?

1200
00:55:23,770 --> 00:55:25,867
Well, you didn't really gimme a chance.

1201
00:55:25,867 --> 00:55:26,950
Oh, do you?

1202
00:55:29,685 --> 00:55:30,518
Yes.

1203
00:55:31,758 --> 00:55:32,591
Great.

1204
00:55:33,435 --> 00:55:35,310
That's gonna make a whole bunch of stuff easier

1205
00:55:35,310 --> 00:55:37,380
and it makes sense.

1206
00:55:37,380 --> 00:55:39,394
Okay. Now that we got that cleared up,

1207
00:55:39,394 --> 00:55:42,567
here's the thing I'm involved in a little situation here.

1208
00:55:42,567 --> 00:55:44,609
Warren, are you being held hostage?

1209
00:55:44,609 --> 00:55:46,084
I mean, can you use this phone?

1210
00:55:46,084 --> 00:55:48,670
Oh yeah. It's a cellular phone.

1211
00:55:48,670 --> 00:55:50,503
It's great. You know, Ronny, you gave it to me,

1212
00:55:50,503 --> 00:55:52,034
except for I can't take incoming calls.

1213
00:55:52,034 --> 00:55:53,357
Warren, are you in danger?

1214
00:55:53,357 --> 00:55:54,781
No, no, no, no.

1215
00:55:54,781 --> 00:55:56,360
See, I'm holding myself hostage

1216
00:55:56,360 --> 00:55:58,250
and I'm pretending it's those Russian guys.

1217
00:55:58,250 --> 00:55:59,277
Why?

1218
00:55:59,277 --> 00:56:00,662
For us.

1219
00:56:00,662 --> 00:56:02,584
Okay. Well for me...

1220
00:56:02,584 --> 00:56:04,713
Well for us, if there can be an us.

1221
00:56:04,713 --> 00:56:06,714
See, I've got to get my money back.

1222
00:56:06,714 --> 00:56:07,720
What money?

1223
00:56:07,720 --> 00:56:09,037
Well, look it's a long story.

1224
00:56:09,037 --> 00:56:10,744
I'll explain it to you later,

1225
00:56:10,744 --> 00:56:12,895
but I need to know that you're with me, Diane.

1226
00:56:12,895 --> 00:56:14,936
I'm gonna follow my dream.

1227
00:56:14,936 --> 00:56:17,506
So you thought you'd start by committing a crime?

1228
00:56:17,506 --> 00:56:19,048
No, no, no. It's not a crime.

1229
00:56:19,048 --> 00:56:20,881
This is my money, I...

1230
00:56:22,408 --> 00:56:24,399
Yeah, I don't know. I thought you'd understand.

1231
00:56:24,399 --> 00:56:26,145
Well, no, I don't understand

1232
00:56:26,145 --> 00:56:27,648
Warren, I think this is insane

1233
00:56:27,648 --> 00:56:30,560
and it's dangerous and I can't be any part of this.

1234
00:56:30,560 --> 00:56:32,753
I got us two tickets to Alaska.

1235
00:56:32,753 --> 00:56:36,350
Oh, then it'll be fine. I didn't know you bought tickets.

1236
00:56:38,046 --> 00:56:39,877
Diane. I have to see you.

1237
00:56:39,877 --> 00:56:43,546
Don't you think that's gonna be a little difficult?

1238
00:56:43,546 --> 00:56:45,963
Please, Warren, listen to me.

1239
00:56:47,101 --> 00:56:51,266
Turn yourself in. That's really the only option you've got.

1240
00:56:51,266 --> 00:56:53,516
No, I... I can't do that.

1241
00:56:57,588 --> 00:56:58,838
I gotta go now.

1242
00:57:00,197 --> 00:57:02,847
I'm sorry to have bothered you.

1243
00:57:02,847 --> 00:57:05,311
You're not bothering me...
(dial tone buzzes)

1244
00:57:05,311 --> 00:57:06,144
Warren?

1245
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:11,960
♪ Maybe my sister, which is also my mom. ♪

1246
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:16,090

(car engine hums)

1247
00:57:16,090 --> 00:57:19,192
(car door slams open)

1248
00:57:19,192 --> 00:57:22,378
SWAT, now we'll see some action.

1249
00:57:22,378 --> 00:57:23,857
Hey there.
Hi Art.

1250
00:57:23,857 --> 00:57:25,702
So, this is it, huh?

1251
00:57:25,702 --> 00:57:27,482
No, no, over here.

1252
00:57:27,482 --> 00:57:29,697
It's all right. Did the same mistake.

1253
00:57:29,697 --> 00:57:31,889
So you wanna fill me any situation?

1254
00:57:31,889 --> 00:57:33,521
Not really. How many SWAT guys we got.

1255
00:57:33,521 --> 00:57:34,758
Three.

1256
00:57:34,758 --> 00:57:36,253
What?
Yeah.

1257
00:57:36,253 --> 00:57:37,718
Bunch of cut backs.

1258
00:57:37,718 --> 00:57:38,881
Not you too.

1259
00:57:38,881 --> 00:57:42,131
Brutal. Awful, but we're really good.

1260
00:57:43,305 --> 00:57:45,055
Good.

1261
00:57:45,055 --> 00:57:46,830
(country music playing)

1262
00:57:46,830 --> 00:57:48,330
All right, team.

1263
00:57:50,033 --> 00:57:50,866
Fan out.

1264
00:57:54,492 --> 00:57:56,291
You call that a fan?

1265
00:57:56,291 --> 00:57:57,830
It's very weak fan, come here.

1266
00:57:57,830 --> 00:58:00,106
Lieutenant? Lieutenant Sneed, a couple of questions.

1267
00:58:00,106 --> 00:58:00,939
Is it political?

1268
00:58:00,939 --> 00:58:03,010
First of all, let me just point out.

1269
00:58:03,010 --> 00:58:05,986
That what's going on here is a crime.

1270
00:58:05,986 --> 00:58:07,527
Well, of course it's a crime.

1271
00:58:07,527 --> 00:58:09,944
What I mean is it's a shame.

1272
00:58:09,944 --> 00:58:11,949
Well, it's a crime and a shame.

1273
00:58:11,949 --> 00:58:13,245
Oh look, if the kidnappers

1274
00:58:13,245 --> 00:58:15,730
or anyone who knows the kidnappers is watching this,

1275
00:58:15,730 --> 00:58:18,055
let me suggest to them that they give up.

1276
00:58:18,055 --> 00:58:20,914
That way is much easier for everyone.

1277
00:58:20,914 --> 00:58:22,931
I know on our side it takes care of a whole lot of paperwork

1278
00:58:22,931 --> 00:58:25,207
and reports and stuff, but it's just a thought.

1279
00:58:25,207 --> 00:58:27,671
Let me leave that with them. No pressure.

1280
00:58:27,671 --> 00:58:29,015
We're going to meet their demands.

1281
00:58:29,015 --> 00:58:30,874
(V.D. groans)
Thank you.

1282
00:58:30,874 --> 00:58:31,794
Any questions?

1283
00:58:31,794 --> 00:58:33,877
Oh, there's Hondo, Hondo!

1284
00:58:33,877 --> 00:58:36,839
Take care of anything...

1285
00:58:36,839 --> 00:58:37,767
As far as I...

1286
00:58:37,767 --> 00:58:39,946
(reporters shouting questions at Hondo)

1287
00:58:39,946 --> 00:58:42,007
One at a time, please, you'll all get your turn.

1288
00:58:42,007 --> 00:58:44,396
Good fellows, keep it up.

1289
00:58:44,396 --> 00:58:46,460
♪ Kinda fancies me ♪

1290
00:58:46,460 --> 00:58:49,240
♪ Woo-Woo! Oh yeah! ♪

1291
00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:54,240
(dramatic music playing)
(dog barking)

1292
00:59:00,521 --> 00:59:02,271
I've been thinking.

1293
00:59:03,338 --> 00:59:04,171
Me too.

1294
00:59:06,904 --> 00:59:09,655
I'd like to apologize for ever having made you question

1295
00:59:09,655 --> 00:59:12,563
the quality of your life.

1296
00:59:12,563 --> 00:59:15,166
Don't worry about it.

1297
00:59:15,166 --> 00:59:16,039
[Reflection Warren] Now here's an idea.

1298
00:59:16,039 --> 00:59:17,739
It's just a thought.

1299
00:59:17,739 --> 00:59:19,532
Why don't you go back to the way it was

1300
00:59:19,532 --> 00:59:21,995
and I'll just disappear?

1301
00:59:21,995 --> 00:59:26,245
(dramatic music continues playing)

1302
00:59:32,606 --> 00:59:34,939
It's the WEOB newsflash...

1303
00:59:38,345 --> 00:59:41,928
(suspenseful music begins)

1304
00:59:48,997 --> 00:59:51,997
(cellphone ringing)

1305
00:59:59,669 --> 01:00:03,086
(landline phone ringing)

1306
01:00:05,655 --> 01:00:06,567
Hello?

1307
01:00:06,567 --> 01:00:09,757
Answer-ay the other phone-ay.

1308
01:00:09,757 --> 01:00:10,759
Who is this?

1309
01:00:10,759 --> 01:00:13,342
Answer-ay the other phone-ay.

1310
01:00:15,226 --> 01:00:17,726
(phone beeps)

1311
01:00:21,525 --> 01:00:24,358
(cellphone rings)

1312
01:00:29,700 --> 01:00:30,633
Hello?

1313
01:00:30,633 --> 01:00:31,814
Hi. You all right?

1314
01:00:31,814 --> 01:00:32,647
Who is this?

1315
01:00:32,647 --> 01:00:34,213
Well, who do you think it is?

1316
01:00:34,213 --> 01:00:35,577
Ronny.
Maybe.

1317
01:00:35,577 --> 01:00:36,580
You all right?

1318
01:00:36,580 --> 01:00:38,409
Yes, yes, I'm fine.

1319
01:00:38,409 --> 01:00:39,550
They let you take calls.

1320
01:00:39,550 --> 01:00:40,672
Who?

1321
01:00:40,672 --> 01:00:41,505
Them?

1322
01:00:41,505 --> 01:00:42,422
Who Them?

1323
01:00:43,665 --> 01:00:48,165
Warren, are there any Russian kidnappers over there?

1324
01:00:50,266 --> 01:00:52,599
Define Russian kidnappers.

1325
01:00:54,004 --> 01:00:57,700
Is Alaska involved in any of this?

1326
01:00:57,700 --> 01:00:58,533
Yes.

1327
01:00:59,509 --> 01:01:00,873
Mhmm.

1328
01:01:00,873 --> 01:01:05,540
Do you understand what kind of big trouble you're in?

1329
01:01:05,540 --> 01:01:06,745
Yes.

1330
01:01:06,745 --> 01:01:08,915
Okay, well, see you at your trial.

1331
01:01:08,915 --> 01:01:12,081
Wait, wait, Ron, wait, Ronny. (dial tone)

1332
01:01:15,249 --> 01:01:17,924
(Warren sighs)

1333
01:01:17,924 --> 01:01:21,591
(suspenseful music playing)

1334
01:01:22,918 --> 01:01:25,501
SWAT one in position.

1335
01:01:30,971 --> 01:01:33,179
SWAT two in position.

1336
01:01:33,179 --> 01:01:35,426
SWAT Three... (shouting and groans)

1337
01:01:35,426 --> 01:01:37,047
SWAT three in position.

1338
01:01:37,047 --> 01:01:38,977
(man grunting)

1339
01:01:38,977 --> 01:01:43,977
(clock ticking)
(suspenseful music playing)

1340
01:01:47,024 --> 01:01:48,242
(alarm buzzes)
(Warren yelps)

1341
01:01:48,242 --> 01:01:50,517
(Reflection Warren screams)

1342
01:01:50,517 --> 01:01:52,570
I can't take it anymore.

1343
01:01:52,570 --> 01:01:55,069
I gotta get outta here.

1344
01:01:55,069 --> 01:01:56,255
Think.

1345
01:01:56,255 --> 01:01:57,088
Think.

1346
01:02:00,179 --> 01:02:01,624
Where are you going?

1347
01:02:01,624 --> 01:02:02,552
I'm escaping.

1348
01:02:02,552 --> 01:02:05,144
I'm begging you, please reconsider.

1349
01:02:05,144 --> 01:02:06,561
Reconsider. Ha.

1350
01:02:07,486 --> 01:02:09,319
I've got a great idea.

1351
01:02:10,806 --> 01:02:15,806
(suspenseful music continues)
(crickets chirping)

1352
01:02:29,043 --> 01:02:31,543
(dog barking)

1353
01:02:33,621 --> 01:02:37,371
Okay, dog (yelps).

1354
01:02:40,297 --> 01:02:43,130
Yes, do you have a refrigerator?

1355
01:02:45,069 --> 01:02:48,064
Is your refrigerator running?

1356
01:02:48,064 --> 01:02:49,468
Well you better catch it (laughs).

1357
01:02:49,468 --> 01:02:53,301
(both men laugh hysterically)

1358
01:02:56,966 --> 01:02:58,689
We gotta fish.
You bet!

1359
01:02:58,689 --> 01:02:59,522
Sucka!

1360
01:03:01,040 --> 01:03:04,948
(suspenseful music playing)

1361
01:03:04,948 --> 01:03:08,159
This is position one, I got something here.

1362
01:03:08,159 --> 01:03:08,992
What is it?

1363
01:03:08,992 --> 01:03:09,986
Permission to fire at will?

1364
01:03:09,986 --> 01:03:12,155
Negative. Negative.

1365
01:03:12,155 --> 01:03:14,988
Just observe and keep us informed.

1366
01:03:16,140 --> 01:03:17,867
Wait a minute.

1367
01:03:17,867 --> 01:03:19,502
Tell her to make sure it's not a reporter.

1368
01:03:19,502 --> 01:03:21,197
Remember how much trouble we got into last night.

1369
01:03:21,197 --> 01:03:24,114
YOU got in.
Yes, and thank you.

1370
01:03:30,745 --> 01:03:31,745
(Reggie yelps)

1371
01:03:31,745 --> 01:03:34,448
Spiders, I hate spiders.

1372
01:03:34,448 --> 01:03:37,989
I don't like this anymore. Take the job, she says.

1373
01:03:37,989 --> 01:03:39,017
It'll keep you in shape.

1374
01:03:39,017 --> 01:03:42,049
(Kathy making machine gun noises)

1375
01:03:42,049 --> 01:03:43,937
(suspenseful music continues playing)

1376
01:03:43,937 --> 01:03:46,354
This was a really bad idea.

1377
01:03:49,017 --> 01:03:51,858
(Ernie grunts)

1378
01:03:51,858 --> 01:03:52,886
This is SWAT leader.

1379
01:03:52,886 --> 01:03:54,817
Put on your night vision goggles.

1380
01:03:54,817 --> 01:03:57,244
Night vision goggles are for sissies.

1381
01:03:57,244 --> 01:03:58,814
You heard me.

1382
01:03:58,814 --> 01:04:00,564
Feel like an idiot.

1383
01:04:05,989 --> 01:04:06,928
Oh boy.

1384
01:04:06,928 --> 01:04:10,321
(shingles scratch on fabric)
(Ernie yelps)

1385
01:04:10,321 --> 01:04:11,888
(loud thud)
(Ernie grunt)

1386
01:04:11,888 --> 01:04:14,471
(Ernie groans)

1387
01:04:15,984 --> 01:04:19,651
(suspenseful music playing)

1388
01:04:23,754 --> 01:04:25,321
Howard?

1389
01:04:25,321 --> 01:04:27,521
(helicopter roars)

1390
01:04:27,521 --> 01:04:28,688
There we go.

1391
01:04:29,615 --> 01:04:30,881
Everybody's working tonight.

1392
01:04:30,881 --> 01:04:33,464
You bet. Melonville's finest.

1393
01:04:42,554 --> 01:04:47,125
(helicopter continues roaring)
(suspenseful music continues)

1394
01:04:47,125 --> 01:04:47,958
(Warren screams)

1395
01:04:47,958 --> 01:04:50,708
(Reggie screams)

1396
01:04:52,352 --> 01:04:54,019
What is it Reggie?

1397
01:04:56,501 --> 01:04:57,835
What do you see?

1398
01:04:57,835 --> 01:04:59,062
What do your eyes tell you, man?

1399
01:04:59,062 --> 01:05:01,403
(Reggie continues screaming)

1400
01:05:01,403 --> 01:05:03,280
(Kathy screaming)

1401
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:06,639
(Warren screaming)

1402
01:05:06,639 --> 01:05:08,742
Don't shoot at your discretion!

1403
01:05:08,742 --> 01:05:10,587
They're working on a free market thing.

1404
01:05:10,587 --> 01:05:12,587
It's driving them crazy.

1405
01:05:13,933 --> 01:05:16,350
Oh. That was a short shift.

1406
01:05:18,225 --> 01:05:19,058
You never catch me up there.

1407
01:05:19,058 --> 01:05:23,247
No sir. Find this fella right here on the ground.

1408
01:05:23,247 --> 01:05:25,329
I'm with you.

1409
01:05:25,329 --> 01:05:26,395
See that movie, 'Blue Thunder'?

1410
01:05:26,395 --> 01:05:28,721
Oh Roy Scheider.
Isn't he good?

1411
01:05:28,721 --> 01:05:30,871
You could have gotten us killed.

1412
01:05:30,871 --> 01:05:33,067
(Gasping) I know, I know, I'm sorry.

1413
01:05:33,067 --> 01:05:34,817
Boy, you should be.

1414
01:05:35,958 --> 01:05:38,116
(glass shatters)
(Warren gasps)

1415
01:05:38,116 --> 01:05:40,152
Elizabeth is gonna be furious.

1416
01:05:40,152 --> 01:05:41,735
Tell me about it.

1417
01:05:46,030 --> 01:05:47,266
Well, you know,

1418
01:05:47,266 --> 01:05:50,264
if you think she's gonna be furious about that,

1419
01:05:50,264 --> 01:05:52,339
can you imagine if I would've gone like this?

1420
01:05:52,339 --> 01:05:53,172
(wood breaking)

1421
01:05:53,172 --> 01:05:56,089
(glass shattering)

1422
01:05:59,517 --> 01:06:01,770
I mean, can you imagine, for example,

1423
01:06:01,770 --> 01:06:03,421
if I would've done something like this.

1424
01:06:03,421 --> 01:06:04,747
(metal rattles)

1425
01:06:04,747 --> 01:06:05,580
Or this?

1426
01:06:05,580 --> 01:06:07,026
(items crashing)

1427
01:06:07,026 --> 01:06:08,386
Oh she would absolutely...

1428
01:06:08,386 --> 01:06:10,006
What if I did things like this and that.

1429
01:06:10,006 --> 01:06:11,874
(loud crashing)

1430
01:06:11,874 --> 01:06:12,957
Can you imagine (laughing)?

1431
01:06:12,957 --> 01:06:16,307
Oh, mister, I could just shake you.

1432
01:06:16,307 --> 01:06:18,807
I am telling Elizabeth on you.

1433
01:06:22,533 --> 01:06:23,566
Wimp

1434
01:06:23,566 --> 01:06:26,235
(egg cracks)

1435
01:06:26,235 --> 01:06:28,985
(Ernie groaning)

1436
01:06:29,879 --> 01:06:31,814
Take care Ernie.

1437
01:06:31,814 --> 01:06:32,853
We'll call Betty.

1438
01:06:32,853 --> 01:06:35,723
(ambulance doors slam)

1439
01:06:35,723 --> 01:06:38,223
(sirens wail)

1440
01:06:40,117 --> 01:06:42,857
(wheels squeal)
(crashing metal)

1441
01:06:42,857 --> 01:06:45,008
(Warren yelping)
Oh.

1442
01:06:45,008 --> 01:06:46,685
Oh.
(loud crashing)

1443
01:06:46,685 --> 01:06:48,761
This is inhuman.

1444
01:06:48,761 --> 01:06:50,871
So I gotta call.

1445
01:06:50,871 --> 01:06:51,954
My God, they're probably teaching him

1446
01:06:51,954 --> 01:06:55,603
some sort of lesson, Slavic barbarians.

1447
01:06:55,603 --> 01:06:58,689
This is a brave guy or crazy.
(siren wailing)

1448
01:06:58,689 --> 01:06:59,716
Or maybe both.

1449
01:06:59,716 --> 01:07:03,639
God, I wish I was better qualified to help him.

1450
01:07:03,639 --> 01:07:04,968
(loud crashing)
(glass breaking)

1451
01:07:04,968 --> 01:07:06,511
Take this, and that!

1452
01:07:06,511 --> 01:07:08,788
(Warren giggling maniacally)

1453
01:07:08,788 --> 01:07:11,455
(phone ringing)

1454
01:07:14,943 --> 01:07:15,864
Hello?

1455
01:07:15,864 --> 01:07:18,842
Sneed here. Kooey that was a brave thing...

1456
01:07:18,842 --> 01:07:19,695
Or crazy.

1457
01:07:19,695 --> 01:07:21,487
Or both. Are you all right?

1458
01:07:21,487 --> 01:07:23,775
Sure. No. No. Are you kidding me?

1459
01:07:23,775 --> 01:07:24,983
These guys get a little bit cranky

1460
01:07:24,983 --> 01:07:27,428
about that little stunt I pulled,

1461
01:07:27,428 --> 01:07:30,017
I guess if... No, no, no, no, please!

1462
01:07:30,017 --> 01:07:31,272
(Russian accent) Give me that phone.

1463
01:07:31,272 --> 01:07:33,550
Giving it to me or else you dolt.

1464
01:07:33,550 --> 01:07:34,675
(normally) No, no, no.

1465
01:07:34,675 --> 01:07:37,003
(glass breaking)
(loud crashing)

1466
01:07:37,003 --> 01:07:38,454
(Warren screaming)

1467
01:07:38,454 --> 01:07:40,046
Please, please stop.

1468
01:07:40,046 --> 01:07:42,371
(glass breaking)
(loud crashing)

1469
01:07:42,371 --> 01:07:43,204
Oh!

1470
01:07:44,729 --> 01:07:47,634
(heavy thuds)

1471
01:07:47,634 --> 01:07:48,467
Hello?

1472
01:07:51,887 --> 01:07:53,637
Hello? Hello Kooey?

1473
01:07:56,372 --> 01:07:57,465
Now, you see, I hate that.

1474
01:07:57,465 --> 01:07:59,257
Give a listen. Am I cut off or am I on hold?

1475
01:07:59,257 --> 01:08:00,090
I don't hear anything.

1476
01:08:00,090 --> 01:08:01,361
No, if you're on hold.

1477
01:08:01,361 --> 01:08:03,274
Why don't they play music? Huh?

1478
01:08:03,274 --> 01:08:04,609
You know, shows we care.

1479
01:08:04,609 --> 01:08:07,228
(loud banging)

1480
01:08:07,228 --> 01:08:08,161
(heavy breathing) Hello.

1481
01:08:08,161 --> 01:08:09,450
A polite way of saying would you hang...

1482
01:08:09,450 --> 01:08:11,642
Hello, Kooey, are you all right?

1483
01:08:11,642 --> 01:08:14,158
(Russian accent) Kooey is temporarily

1484
01:08:14,158 --> 01:08:17,406
out of breath from the beating.

1485
01:08:17,406 --> 01:08:20,656
I want to hear that from him, please.

1486
01:08:21,669 --> 01:08:23,048
Hello?

1487
01:08:23,048 --> 01:08:24,383
Kooey, hang in there.

1488
01:08:24,383 --> 01:08:25,834
We'll have you out in a second.

1489
01:08:25,834 --> 01:08:27,653
(Russian accent) You have the money here?

1490
01:08:27,653 --> 01:08:29,640
Everything okay.

1491
01:08:29,640 --> 01:08:31,890
If no, everything very bad.

1492
01:08:33,051 --> 01:08:35,040
Can you hang on a second? What?

1493
01:08:35,040 --> 01:08:36,405
Is this pizza?

1494
01:08:36,405 --> 01:08:37,880
Pizza?

1495
01:08:37,880 --> 01:08:41,836
(train whistle blows)

1496
01:08:41,836 --> 01:08:43,420
Your pizza's here.

1497
01:08:43,420 --> 01:08:44,253
What?

1498
01:08:45,265 --> 01:08:46,098
My pizza?

1499
01:08:47,708 --> 01:08:49,791
Oh.. Yeah, hold on a sec.

1500
01:08:51,773 --> 01:08:55,440
(sentimental music playing)

1501
01:08:56,984 --> 01:08:59,632
(Russian accent) Yes, send in pizza,

1502
01:08:59,632 --> 01:09:02,299
but no police, send in the girl.

1503
01:09:03,168 --> 01:09:04,955
I'm not risking another hostage.

1504
01:09:04,955 --> 01:09:09,285
Kooey loses a finger for every minute you delay.

1505
01:09:09,285 --> 01:09:11,727
(Lt. Sneed sighs)

1506
01:09:11,727 --> 01:09:13,644
Jerry, get rid of it.

1507
01:09:14,628 --> 01:09:17,378
You willing to deliver the pizza?

1508
01:09:18,768 --> 01:09:21,993
Yes.
(crowd whispers)

1509
01:09:21,993 --> 01:09:25,076
(wheelchair rattles)

1510
01:09:30,242 --> 01:09:33,507
(knocking on door)

1511
01:09:33,507 --> 01:09:36,125
(sentimental music continues playing)

1512
01:09:36,125 --> 01:09:37,708
I don't like it.

1513
01:09:41,743 --> 01:09:43,699
(Diane gasps)

1514
01:09:43,699 --> 01:09:45,503
(crowd rumbles in concern)

1515
01:09:45,503 --> 01:09:47,033
I knew that was gonna happen.

1516
01:09:47,033 --> 01:09:49,864
You called it.
I did, didn't I?

1517
01:09:49,864 --> 01:09:50,894
I didn't see it coming.

1518
01:09:50,894 --> 01:09:52,088
Not at all. I did.

1519
01:09:52,088 --> 01:09:53,822
I did, saw it coming. Saw it.

1520
01:09:53,822 --> 01:09:56,328
(slamming on car roof)

1521
01:09:56,328 --> 01:09:58,504
Sure I can't get you anything?

1522
01:09:58,504 --> 01:10:01,613
No, thanks.
Soft drink and coffee.

1523
01:10:01,613 --> 01:10:04,946
Sorry about this mess, we're renovating.

1524
01:10:06,883 --> 01:10:07,716
And...

1525
01:10:09,464 --> 01:10:10,381
This is....

1526
01:10:12,976 --> 01:10:14,932
I'll tell you what I've learned though.

1527
01:10:14,932 --> 01:10:17,299
I've learned there's a big difference

1528
01:10:17,299 --> 01:10:19,549
between a plan and an idea.

1529
01:10:20,768 --> 01:10:24,474
See a plan, there you've got things that...

1530
01:10:24,474 --> 01:10:28,307
(sentimental music continues)

1531
01:10:31,293 --> 01:10:33,043
Thank you for coming.

1532
01:10:34,613 --> 01:10:37,780
I'm really glad you changed your mind.

1533
01:10:38,635 --> 01:10:41,457
I didn't change my mind.

1534
01:10:41,457 --> 01:10:43,594
I came to get you.

1535
01:10:43,594 --> 01:10:46,177
I want you to come out with me.

1536
01:10:51,650 --> 01:10:53,567
I can't do it, Diana.

1537
01:10:54,624 --> 01:10:57,526
This has all gone too far. I said no police and now.

1538
01:10:57,526 --> 01:10:59,462
Yeah, but you can explain all that.

1539
01:10:59,462 --> 01:11:03,093
I don't want to explain. I'm tired of explaining.

1540
01:11:03,093 --> 01:11:04,246
I just want to go.

1541
01:11:04,246 --> 01:11:09,246
I wanna stop wasting my life and I want you to come with me.

1542
01:11:11,563 --> 01:11:16,563
(over the speaker) Send out the pizza girl.

1543
01:11:23,777 --> 01:11:25,194
You have to go.

1544
01:11:30,411 --> 01:11:33,330
(Diane sighs)

1545
01:11:33,330 --> 01:11:35,913
Yeah, I suppose you're right.

1546
01:11:36,975 --> 01:11:41,099
(sentimental music continues)

1547
01:11:41,099 --> 01:11:42,512
Are you all right, miss?

1548
01:11:42,512 --> 01:11:45,473
How was it in there? Is Mr. Kooey holding up?

1549
01:11:45,473 --> 01:11:46,556
Not really.

1550
01:11:47,438 --> 01:11:48,902
I knew it.

1551
01:11:48,902 --> 01:11:50,520
He's just not himself.

1552
01:11:50,520 --> 01:11:52,017
Ah, I knew it.

1553
01:11:52,017 --> 01:11:54,774
Maybe he hasn't been himself for a long time

1554
01:11:54,774 --> 01:11:56,678
and I'm glad that he's finding himself again.

1555
01:11:56,678 --> 01:11:59,765
And that we found each other again.

1556
01:11:59,765 --> 01:12:02,709
I love him, but this just isn't right.

1557
01:12:02,709 --> 01:12:05,915
I mean, it's right. But he's going about it all wrong.

1558
01:12:05,915 --> 01:12:08,283
You know? I mean, you can't start a new life

1559
01:12:08,283 --> 01:12:11,627
with someone by committing a crime.

1560
01:12:11,627 --> 01:12:14,272
I mean, you can, but that's not the kind of life

1561
01:12:14,272 --> 01:12:16,439
he's after. We're after...

1562
01:12:18,096 --> 01:12:20,552
He's sweet and he's kind

1563
01:12:20,552 --> 01:12:24,086
and he deserves the best life possible

1564
01:12:24,086 --> 01:12:27,226
and it has to start out properly.

1565
01:12:27,226 --> 01:12:28,143
Doesn't it?

1566
01:12:34,063 --> 01:12:36,610
What are you saying?

1567
01:12:36,610 --> 01:12:40,027
Well, what I'm saying is that he, well,

1568
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:47,312
there are no kidnappers, it's just him and the dog in there.

1569
01:12:47,312 --> 01:12:48,940
I knew it.

1570
01:12:48,940 --> 01:12:51,227
Everybody into position.

1571
01:12:51,227 --> 01:12:52,060
I didn't see that one coming.

1572
01:12:52,060 --> 01:12:53,515
You didn't?
Not at all.

1573
01:12:53,515 --> 01:12:55,554
No, I missed that one too.

1574
01:12:55,554 --> 01:12:56,649
I had no clue.

1575
01:12:56,649 --> 01:12:58,064
I saw it. Saw it all the way.

1576
01:12:58,064 --> 01:13:01,570
(machine gun fire rattles)

1577
01:13:01,570 --> 01:13:04,237
(crowd screams)

1578
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:27,871
Would you fellows be SWAT members?

1579
01:13:27,871 --> 01:13:31,121
(Russian accent) No.

1580
01:13:32,651 --> 01:13:35,229
Am I in a little bit of trouble then?

1581
01:13:35,229 --> 01:13:40,229
No. I'd say you were in a very big bit of trouble.

1582
01:13:40,367 --> 01:13:43,992
Stand back, or I'm gonna blow us all to kingdom come.

1583
01:13:43,992 --> 01:13:48,470
(bones cracking)
(Russian music playing)

1584
01:13:48,470 --> 01:13:51,303
(switch flicking)

1585
01:13:52,745 --> 01:13:54,928
Faulty wiring.
(Yuri tsking)

1586
01:13:54,928 --> 01:13:56,179
(Kiki barking)

1587
01:13:56,179 --> 01:13:57,611
Look!

1588
01:13:57,611 --> 01:14:01,105
(Russian goons fawning over Kiki)

1589
01:14:01,105 --> 01:14:04,038
(skulls knock together)
(Russians groan)

1590
01:14:04,038 --> 01:14:05,955
After him, after him!

1591
01:14:07,966 --> 01:14:10,799
(gunfire rattles)

1592
01:14:13,272 --> 01:14:14,631
(flares sizzle)
Oh, fellas,

1593
01:14:14,631 --> 01:14:16,258
Here are those flares you ordered.

1594
01:14:16,258 --> 01:14:17,709
What flares? Did you order any flares?

1595
01:14:17,709 --> 01:14:20,413
No, I didn't even see the catalog.

1596
01:14:20,413 --> 01:14:21,796
(Russians scream)

1597
01:14:21,796 --> 01:14:25,919
(gunfire rattles)
(Russian music playing)

1598
01:14:25,919 --> 01:14:27,762
Get him, where is he?

1599
01:14:27,762 --> 01:14:29,615
You get him, I'll get the dog!

1600
01:14:29,615 --> 01:14:30,448
All right!

1601
01:14:30,448 --> 01:14:33,448
(door knob rattles)

1602
01:14:34,553 --> 01:14:36,803
Were you going somewhere?

1603
01:14:38,009 --> 01:14:40,741
You know, stretch the legs, you know, a little fresh air.

1604
01:14:40,741 --> 01:14:42,405
I'm afraid that won't be possible.

1605
01:14:42,405 --> 01:14:43,238
No?

1606
01:14:43,238 --> 01:14:46,520
No, you're going to be very tied up. Get over here.

1607
01:14:46,520 --> 01:14:48,568
That's basically. That's all we know.

1608
01:14:48,568 --> 01:14:52,177
And that that's pretty much the, the scope of it.

1609
01:14:52,177 --> 01:14:55,385
Howard, do you have anything you want to add?

1610
01:14:55,385 --> 01:14:59,110
Ditto. Yeah, we really don't know anything.

1611
01:14:59,110 --> 01:15:02,143
(both laughing)

1612
01:15:02,143 --> 01:15:04,526
If you folks would like to help yourself

1613
01:15:04,526 --> 01:15:07,476
to some, you know, fresh donuts and some hot coffee,

1614
01:15:07,476 --> 01:15:09,716
we made a run for you, please go over there.

1615
01:15:09,716 --> 01:15:10,750
And, if we do know anything,

1616
01:15:10,750 --> 01:15:12,825
you'll be the first that we tell,

1617
01:15:12,825 --> 01:15:14,651
I can guarantee you that, huh Howard?

1618
01:15:14,651 --> 01:15:15,892
Thanks for your help.

1619
01:15:15,892 --> 01:15:18,142
All right then.
Thanks.

1620
01:15:19,473 --> 01:15:22,370
You know, you guys are useless.

1621
01:15:22,370 --> 01:15:23,203
Ditto.

1622
01:15:31,079 --> 01:15:34,304
That, my friend, is why I do not dabble in politics.

1623
01:15:34,304 --> 01:15:35,358
Tell you.

1624
01:15:35,358 --> 01:15:36,800
Well, you see, they just like to, you know,

1625
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:39,318
build you up just so they can, you know, tear you down.

1626
01:15:39,318 --> 01:15:40,206
I'll say.
Yeah.

1627
01:15:40,206 --> 01:15:41,039
The knees right from under you.

1628
01:15:41,039 --> 01:15:41,872
Yeah.

1629
01:15:41,872 --> 01:15:42,905
You see that movie 'Broadcast News'?

1630
01:15:42,905 --> 01:15:44,100
Oh, Albert Brooks.

1631
01:15:44,100 --> 01:15:45,308
He's funny, isn't he?

1632
01:15:45,308 --> 01:15:46,408
Well, yeah.

1633
01:15:46,408 --> 01:15:49,961
When your birthday comes, must jump out,

1634
01:15:49,961 --> 01:15:52,544
January, February, March, April, May, June,

1635
01:15:52,544 --> 01:15:56,350
(jump rope striking the pavement)

1636
01:15:56,350 --> 01:16:00,767
July, August, September, October, November, December.

1637
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:06,794
Can we pick it up here? I'm trying to stay awake.

1638
01:16:06,794 --> 01:16:08,552
Come on guys.

1639
01:16:08,552 --> 01:16:11,385
(crowd murmuring)

1640
01:16:12,672 --> 01:16:14,827
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha...

1641
01:16:14,827 --> 01:16:16,244
Coming close...

1642
01:16:24,117 --> 01:16:27,162
Harv? Can I have a C please?

1643
01:16:27,162 --> 01:16:28,412
There's no C.

1644
01:16:29,727 --> 01:16:31,130
You're telling me that's not squirrel.

1645
01:16:31,130 --> 01:16:31,963
It's squirrel, yes.

1646
01:16:31,963 --> 01:16:32,796
Can I have my C please?

1647
01:16:32,796 --> 01:16:33,629
There's no C in squirrel.

1648
01:16:33,629 --> 01:16:34,609
Can I just have my C please?

1649
01:16:34,609 --> 01:16:35,442
I'm not gonna...

1650
01:16:35,442 --> 01:16:37,090
we're playing by English rules, are we not?

1651
01:16:37,090 --> 01:16:42,090
(Warren breathing softly)
(traffic humming)

1652
01:16:49,547 --> 01:16:51,130
Psst. Over here.

1653
01:16:52,229 --> 01:16:54,608
(Kiki growls)

1654
01:16:54,608 --> 01:16:55,605
Are you okay?

1655
01:16:55,605 --> 01:16:57,717
Yeah, yeah. I'm fine.

1656
01:16:57,717 --> 01:16:59,000
Sh wait.

1657
01:16:59,000 --> 01:16:59,833
Sorry.

1658
01:17:00,913 --> 01:17:02,352
(dramatic music begins)
Who are you speaking with,

1659
01:17:02,352 --> 01:17:04,373
Mr. Road flares?

1660
01:17:04,373 --> 01:17:07,349
My ego, or my id, or something. It's a hallucination.

1661
01:17:07,349 --> 01:17:09,541
Don't be crazy with me.

1662
01:17:09,541 --> 01:17:11,066
(Kiki barking)

1663
01:17:11,066 --> 01:17:13,899
(gunfire rattles)

1664
01:17:18,049 --> 01:17:23,049
(crowd screaming)
(gunfire continues)

1665
01:17:24,842 --> 01:17:27,342
(phone rings)

1666
01:17:29,845 --> 01:17:30,678
Sneed.

1667
01:17:30,678 --> 01:17:32,224
Where is money?

1668
01:17:32,224 --> 01:17:33,275
Who is this?

1669
01:17:33,275 --> 01:17:34,644
What's going on?

1670
01:17:34,644 --> 01:17:36,644
We want the money now.

1671
01:17:37,872 --> 01:17:39,333
Who is this?

1672
01:17:39,333 --> 01:17:40,775
Where's the other Russian guy.

1673
01:17:40,775 --> 01:17:42,747
You listen and be listening very carefully

1674
01:17:42,747 --> 01:17:44,948
because I'm only going to say this one time.

1675
01:17:44,948 --> 01:17:47,669
You have three minutes to send in here, the money,

1676
01:17:47,669 --> 01:17:49,878
or I send him out in pieces.

1677
01:17:49,878 --> 01:17:52,480
Okay. But you must stop the shooting.

1678
01:17:52,480 --> 01:17:54,283
You're scaring everybody.

1679
01:17:54,283 --> 01:17:59,283
(gunfire rattling)
(Russian music playing)

1680
01:17:59,707 --> 01:18:02,507
Don't tell me what to do.

1681
01:18:02,507 --> 01:18:04,336
Where is the money?

1682
01:18:04,336 --> 01:18:07,197
It's being secured as we speak, but please be careful.

1683
01:18:07,197 --> 01:18:08,923
This is a neighborhood.

1684
01:18:08,923 --> 01:18:09,989
And this is a kidnapping,

1685
01:18:09,989 --> 01:18:12,930
it needs money to reach its full potential.

1686
01:18:12,930 --> 01:18:14,843
I understand that.

1687
01:18:14,843 --> 01:18:16,343
Thanks for calling

1688
01:18:20,019 --> 01:18:22,852
(tires squealing)

1689
01:18:26,536 --> 01:18:29,260
(doors slamming)
Am I glad to see you.

1690
01:18:29,260 --> 01:18:31,286
They got guns and everything in there and they're using them

1691
01:18:31,286 --> 01:18:32,592
and they're not the same two guys.

1692
01:18:32,592 --> 01:18:34,261
You only got two minutes to send the money in there.

1693
01:18:34,261 --> 01:18:35,739
Get a hold of yourself, Sneed.

1694
01:18:35,739 --> 01:18:37,915
I'm not letting this money outta my sight.

1695
01:18:37,915 --> 01:18:38,861
So get used to it.

1696
01:18:38,861 --> 01:18:39,694
There's been shooting!

1697
01:18:39,694 --> 01:18:43,694
And they're real guns and they're really loud.

1698
01:18:47,486 --> 01:18:49,562
I can take care of myself.

1699
01:18:49,562 --> 01:18:52,303
All right. Okay. Fine.

1700
01:18:52,303 --> 01:18:53,149
Why the change in heart?

1701
01:18:53,149 --> 01:18:55,469
Because of your money thing. I just realized I don't care.

1702
01:18:55,469 --> 01:18:56,996
If you get hurt.

1703
01:18:56,996 --> 01:18:59,378
That's more like it.

1704
01:18:59,378 --> 01:19:00,545
Wrong house.

1705
01:19:01,725 --> 01:19:03,225
We've all done it.

1706
01:19:04,401 --> 01:19:06,877
Mrs. Kooey. How about an interview?

1707
01:19:06,877 --> 01:19:08,770
Daddy? Could you grab my compact?

1708
01:19:08,770 --> 01:19:09,801
Yeah. Yeah.

1709
01:19:09,801 --> 01:19:12,356
Daddy, there's cameras.

1710
01:19:12,356 --> 01:19:15,791
Warren, this money's just a loan.

1711
01:19:15,791 --> 01:19:19,129
I'm adding it to what you already owe me.

1712
01:19:19,129 --> 01:19:22,379
(knocking on the door)

1713
01:19:30,172 --> 01:19:31,116
(Russian music playing)

1714
01:19:31,116 --> 01:19:33,295
Give me the money.
No.

1715
01:19:33,295 --> 01:19:34,500
Give me the money.
NO!

1716
01:19:34,500 --> 01:19:36,063
Kiki... Kiki, good dog.

1717
01:19:36,063 --> 01:19:37,540
Give me the money, I mean it.

1718
01:19:37,540 --> 01:19:38,442
It's a good dog, bit the rope.

1719
01:19:38,442 --> 01:19:40,032
I'm not playing around here.

1720
01:19:40,032 --> 01:19:41,240
Neither am I.

1721
01:19:41,240 --> 01:19:42,573
No!
Yes!

1722
01:19:42,573 --> 01:19:44,161
No!
Yes!

1723
01:19:44,161 --> 01:19:47,722
It's working Kiki. Just a little more.

1724
01:19:47,722 --> 01:19:48,555
Just gimme the money.

1725
01:19:48,555 --> 01:19:50,394
I can't, it's against my nature.

1726
01:19:50,394 --> 01:19:54,227
Perhaps bullets will be more to your nature.

1727
01:19:56,356 --> 01:19:58,938
Boris Yeltsin...
Where is Boris Yeltsin?

1728
01:19:58,938 --> 01:20:02,108
(loud punch)
(Russians grunt)

1729
01:20:02,108 --> 01:20:04,241
(military music playing)

1730
01:20:04,241 --> 01:20:08,177
Boris Yeltsin... Kooey, you're next!

1731
01:20:08,177 --> 01:20:10,927
(glass shatters)

1732
01:20:15,034 --> 01:20:18,701
(suspenseful music playing)

1733
01:20:23,564 --> 01:20:25,814
(door slams)

1734
01:20:25,814 --> 01:20:28,564
(Russians groan)

1735
01:20:33,422 --> 01:20:36,818
The money, the money, where is the money?

1736
01:20:36,818 --> 01:20:37,985
Where's Kooey?

1737
01:20:39,266 --> 01:20:41,250
(men shouting)
(gunfire rattling)

1738
01:20:41,250 --> 01:20:44,367
(Kiki barking)
This way!

1739
01:20:44,367 --> 01:20:46,450
What are you shooting at?

1740
01:20:49,487 --> 01:20:51,923
(car engine revs)

1741
01:20:51,923 --> 01:20:54,673
(wheels screech)

1742
01:20:56,979 --> 01:21:00,646
(suspenseful music playing)

1743
01:21:03,711 --> 01:21:06,711
(wheels screeching)

1744
01:21:08,017 --> 01:21:10,637
Oh my God!
(Kiki barking)

1745
01:21:10,637 --> 01:21:11,815
My Kiki!

1746
01:21:11,815 --> 01:21:15,682
Let's roll, people.
(Elizabeth shrieks)

1747
01:21:15,682 --> 01:21:18,300
(classical music playing)

1748
01:21:18,300 --> 01:21:20,631
Don't let 'em get away!

1749
01:21:20,631 --> 01:21:23,714
(car wheels screech)

1750
01:21:27,378 --> 01:21:31,146
My daddy, get my daddy!

1751
01:21:31,146 --> 01:21:35,396
(sirens wailing)
(classical music continues)

1752
01:21:35,396 --> 01:21:38,563
(Elizabeth screaming)

1753
01:21:40,363 --> 01:21:42,721
Come on, hurry up, let's go.

1754
01:21:42,721 --> 01:21:43,654
Come on, let's go!

1755
01:21:43,654 --> 01:21:46,404
(sirens wailing)

1756
01:21:53,772 --> 01:21:56,188
Yes!
(classical music continues)

1757
01:21:56,188 --> 01:21:59,438
Let's get in. Get in, get in, get in.

1758
01:22:00,406 --> 01:22:02,239
Now. Where's Regg?

1759
01:22:02,239 --> 01:22:04,572
Regg, Regg? Regg, you there?

1760
01:22:06,813 --> 01:22:08,896
Oh, they're getting away.

1761
01:22:13,272 --> 01:22:15,765
(classical music continues)

1762
01:22:15,765 --> 01:22:16,853
Wow. Huh?

1763
01:22:16,853 --> 01:22:17,686
Yeah.

1764
01:22:17,686 --> 01:22:18,703
[Reflection Warren] You did it.

1765
01:22:18,703 --> 01:22:20,187
Yeah.

1766
01:22:20,187 --> 01:22:22,488
All those people who always thought you were so uptight.

1767
01:22:22,488 --> 01:22:23,321
You showed them.

1768
01:22:23,321 --> 01:22:24,154
Yeah.

1769
01:22:25,071 --> 01:22:27,917
Wait, who thought I was so uptight?

1770
01:22:27,917 --> 01:22:28,750
No one.

1771
01:22:35,362 --> 01:22:37,041
(Kiki barking)

1772
01:22:37,041 --> 01:22:40,070
Look Andres, the little dog has followed us.

1773
01:22:40,070 --> 01:22:41,468
What are you doing here?

1774
01:22:41,468 --> 01:22:43,635
Hey, come here, you... Ow!

1775
01:22:44,562 --> 01:22:46,139
The dog is vicious.

1776
01:22:46,139 --> 01:22:48,861
You're a little, cute dog, don't bite people like that.

1777
01:22:48,861 --> 01:22:49,694
(Kiki barking)

1778
01:22:49,694 --> 01:22:53,122
Don't growl at me, why are you always growling?

1779
01:22:53,122 --> 01:22:54,481
(classical music continues)
(Kiki continues barking)

1780
01:22:54,481 --> 01:22:57,914
(Russians shouting)

1781
01:22:57,914 --> 01:23:00,920
I'm sorry, I'm afraid of the cute little dog.

1782
01:23:00,920 --> 01:23:02,460
Why is he like this?
(Kiki continues barking)

1783
01:23:02,460 --> 01:23:05,043
Yuri, he's there, he's there.

1784
01:23:06,645 --> 01:23:09,395
(sirens wailing)

1785
01:23:12,271 --> 01:23:15,803
(classical music continues)

1786
01:23:15,803 --> 01:23:18,553
Come on, you moron, step on it.

1787
01:23:20,556 --> 01:23:23,473
(wheels squealing)

1788
01:23:28,367 --> 01:23:31,811
(sirens continue wailing)

1789
01:23:31,811 --> 01:23:34,811

1793
01:23:49,934 --> 01:23:52,770
Step on it, move it come on.
I'm going as fast as I can.

1794
01:23:52,770 --> 01:23:56,156
It's a Jaguar, it's not a lot, you know?

1795
01:23:56,156 --> 01:23:59,073

1796
01:24:14,009 --> 01:24:19,009

(tires squealing)

1799
01:24:32,619 --> 01:24:35,536
We're going the wrong way!

1800
01:24:38,104 --> 01:24:40,490
Hey man, sorry about that egg before.

1801
01:24:40,490 --> 01:24:42,801
Yeah, forget it. I probably deserved it.

1802
01:24:42,801 --> 01:24:45,510
No, isn't this great though?

1803
01:24:45,510 --> 01:24:47,930
I feel so much better already.

1804
01:24:47,930 --> 01:24:49,426
I feel free.

1805
01:24:49,426 --> 01:24:51,386
Yeah, well, it's been nice visiting with you

1806
01:24:51,386 --> 01:24:52,532
here on a conscious level,

1807
01:24:52,532 --> 01:24:55,332
but I think it's time for me to get back where I belong.

1808
01:24:55,332 --> 01:24:56,187
I'm gonna become whole again?

1809
01:24:56,187 --> 01:24:59,077
As crazy as it sounds. Yes.

1810
01:24:59,077 --> 01:25:01,939
You see, despite how nuts you appear to be at the moment,

1811
01:25:01,939 --> 01:25:04,660
in reality, you're the sanest you've ever been.

1812
01:25:04,660 --> 01:25:06,832
Hey, all right.

1813
01:25:06,832 --> 01:25:08,546
Course, people who really are nuts

1814
01:25:08,546 --> 01:25:11,001
probably talk just like this.

1815
01:25:11,001 --> 01:25:13,584
(tires squeal)

1816
01:25:15,641 --> 01:25:19,974

1820
01:25:39,493 --> 01:25:41,381
(dramatic music playing)

1821
01:25:41,381 --> 01:25:42,425
Oh God... Oh...

1822
01:25:42,425 --> 01:25:44,131
Up against the truck and spread 'em!

1823
01:25:44,131 --> 01:25:45,304
Don't shoot, don't shoot!

1824
01:25:45,304 --> 01:25:47,863
I give up, I'm sorry, it's a telephone. Don't shoot.

1825
01:25:47,863 --> 01:25:48,799
Yeah, and I'll take it.

1826
01:25:48,799 --> 01:25:50,436
Not gonna need it where you're going, man.

1827
01:25:50,436 --> 01:25:52,210
Ronny!
(Ronny laughing)

1828
01:25:52,210 --> 01:25:53,780
Nice drive. Except for the end there.

1829
01:25:53,780 --> 01:25:55,124
Isn't this amazing?
Amazing.

1830
01:25:55,124 --> 01:25:56,091
Did you hear from Diane?

1831
01:25:56,091 --> 01:25:57,571
I tried to reach her, man, I couldn't get her.

1832
01:25:57,571 --> 01:25:58,713
Come on, let's get outta here.

1833
01:25:58,713 --> 01:26:00,515
Listen, what I said before, about this being wrong,

1834
01:26:00,515 --> 01:26:02,674
that was wrong, What you're doing is right, man.

1835
01:26:02,674 --> 01:26:03,855
You gotta live your dreams.

1836
01:26:03,855 --> 01:26:04,707
All right, do you wanna come with me?

1837
01:26:04,707 --> 01:26:05,540
No.
All right.

1838
01:26:05,540 --> 01:26:06,373
Come on.
Don't... wait, wait.

1839
01:26:06,373 --> 01:26:08,632
The money, the money.

1840
01:26:08,632 --> 01:26:10,685
I'm only gonna take 47,000. Okay?

1841
01:26:10,685 --> 01:26:11,518
Yeah.

1842
01:26:11,518 --> 01:26:13,184
That's what's owed me. Here, hold this.

1843
01:26:13,184 --> 01:26:14,989
I want you to take the rest of it back tomorrow?

1844
01:26:14,989 --> 01:26:16,303
Huh? Give it back to them?

1845
01:26:16,303 --> 01:26:17,136
Yeah.
No man!

1846
01:26:17,136 --> 01:26:19,146
Why don't I take it, I got some expenses,

1847
01:26:19,146 --> 01:26:21,724
I got fees, closing costs, you know?

1848
01:26:21,724 --> 01:26:22,589
Right. What was I thinking?
Yeah.

1849
01:26:22,589 --> 01:26:25,210
What was I thinking? Of course. Hurry.

1850
01:26:25,210 --> 01:26:26,601
Come on, let's go, let's go, let's go!

1851
01:26:26,601 --> 01:26:29,819
(tires squealing)

1852
01:26:29,819 --> 01:26:31,389
Remember, no credit cards used ever.

1853
01:26:31,389 --> 01:26:33,083
Yeah.
(suspenseful music playing)

1854
01:26:33,083 --> 01:26:36,379
I'll be in the phone book, under D. Crockett.

1855
01:26:36,379 --> 01:26:39,129
Come on, let's get out of here.

1856
01:26:42,120 --> 01:26:44,771

1857
01:26:44,771 --> 01:26:47,188

1858
01:26:50,029 --> 01:26:52,005
(Russian music begins)
Why would you hit the truck?

1859
01:26:52,005 --> 01:26:53,673
I didn't hit the truck.

1860
01:26:53,673 --> 01:26:54,873
Oh no, you didn't hit the truck.

1861
01:26:54,873 --> 01:26:57,320
It just fell over on its own.

1862
01:26:57,320 --> 01:27:00,799
Yes, the truck just fell over on its own.

1863
01:27:00,799 --> 01:27:02,904
(explosion roars)

1864
01:27:02,904 --> 01:27:04,862

1867
01:27:08,857 --> 01:27:11,357

1868
01:27:13,062 --> 01:27:16,479
(dramatic music playing)

1869
01:27:27,025 --> 01:27:28,025
Our money!

1870
01:27:29,112 --> 01:27:30,056
My money!

1871
01:27:30,056 --> 01:27:31,288
My money.

1872
01:27:31,288 --> 01:27:33,538
Is Mr. Kooey in that van?

1873
01:27:35,980 --> 01:27:38,111
I was his friend.

1874
01:27:38,111 --> 01:27:40,485
Now I guess I'm just his executor.

1875
01:27:40,485 --> 01:27:43,652
(loud, dramatic sobs)

1876
01:27:49,185 --> 01:27:51,697
Say, you guys need representation?

1877
01:27:51,697 --> 01:27:53,425
You know anything about movie rights?

1878
01:27:53,425 --> 01:27:54,635
I sure do.

1879
01:27:54,635 --> 01:27:55,468
Cuff 'em.

1880
01:27:55,468 --> 01:27:56,301
I'm an attorney.

1881
01:27:56,301 --> 01:27:57,370
I mean, you guys are gonna need one.

1882
01:27:57,370 --> 01:27:58,816
You see, perhaps in your country, it doesn't mean...

1883
01:27:58,816 --> 01:28:01,174
(fire roars)

1884
01:28:01,174 --> 01:28:02,289
(melancholy music begins)
Are you familiar

1885
01:28:02,289 --> 01:28:04,122
with the concept of...

1886
01:28:07,382 --> 01:28:10,780
Oh! Kiki!
(Kiki barks)

1887
01:28:10,780 --> 01:28:12,613
Ow! Oh! You bad dog!

1888
01:28:14,684 --> 01:28:16,120
All right, let's go people.

1889
01:28:16,120 --> 01:28:17,542
Let's arrest those who should be arrested

1890
01:28:17,542 --> 01:28:18,967
and read rights to those who should hear 'em

1891
01:28:18,967 --> 01:28:23,117
and all those other police things that need to be done.

1892
01:28:23,117 --> 01:28:26,534
(peaceful music playing)

1893
01:28:31,641 --> 01:28:34,308

(peaceful music continues)

1896
01:28:59,132 --> 01:29:01,701
So you enjoying the place boss?

1897
01:29:01,701 --> 01:29:05,357
We sure are glad you bought it- means jobs for a lot of us.

1898
01:29:05,357 --> 01:29:07,274
Means freedom for me.

1899
01:29:12,901 --> 01:29:16,954
So say anyhow, I'm gonna go check the guide boats.

1900
01:29:16,954 --> 01:29:18,624
Make sure they're ready for the people.

1901
01:29:18,624 --> 01:29:21,291
Fine. I think I'll fish a bit.

1902
01:29:22,393 --> 01:29:27,393

1903

(fishing line clicks and whirs)

1904
01:29:47,236 --> 01:29:48,315
Nice cast.

1905
01:29:48,315 --> 01:29:51,148
Hey, back off will you, I'm new.

1906
01:29:52,277 --> 01:29:54,663
You. What are you doing here?

1907
01:29:54,663 --> 01:29:56,799
Relax, I'm just checking in.

1908
01:29:56,799 --> 01:29:58,596
How are you?

1909
01:29:58,596 --> 01:29:59,596
Pretty good.

1910
01:30:02,804 --> 01:30:03,637
Well....

1911
01:30:05,178 --> 01:30:06,624
Something missing?

1912
01:30:06,624 --> 01:30:07,457
Someone.

1913
01:30:08,895 --> 01:30:09,728
Who?

1914
01:30:12,777 --> 01:30:14,915
(wheel chair rattles)

1915
01:30:14,915 --> 01:30:15,998
Me?

1916
01:30:16,924 --> 01:30:19,674

1917

(lips smacking)

1919
01:30:38,386 --> 01:30:40,313
Best friends.

1920
01:30:40,313 --> 01:30:41,620
Best friends forever.
