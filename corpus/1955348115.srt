1
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,726
Where's the equipment?

2
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,200
Kurva!

3
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,169
What happened?

4
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,561
Caught on one of the branches
on the way down.

5
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,642
Can you walk?

6
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,686
You'll need stitches.

7
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:08,921
Hey.

8
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,882
You didn't hide your parachutes very well,

9
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:14,884
and you left a blood trail
for half a kilometer.

10
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,289
Follow me.

11
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,850
I live not far from here.

12
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,449
Dik! Come!

13
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,521
Ignác.

14
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,926
Ignác!

15
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,722
Hot soup. Come.

16
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,640
Come in.

17
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,608
I take it you are heading for Prague.

18
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:08,807
How far is it?

19
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,006
Thirty kilometers.

20
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:13,562
I have a special
delivery permit for my truck.

21
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,130
I could take you.

22
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,687
Thank you.

23
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,290
You rest here tonight.

24
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,449
I will take you in the morning.

25
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,930
Enjoy your soup.

26
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,929
Please, sit.

27
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,490
How much do the Germans pay you?

28
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,441
For turning in
your fellow countrymen, huh?

29
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,525
Drop the gun.

30
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,200
I said, drop the gun.

31
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,443
Drop it.

32
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,567
Drop the gun!

33
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,361
Gun.

34
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,007
You get him?

35
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,283
We'll take that truck.

36
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,600
Come on.

37
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:35,809
They had made their choice, Jan.

38
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,525
Sometimes you have to pick a side.

39
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,886
Would you prefer it was us?

40
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,604
Should be the next left.

41
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,404
Pull over here.

42
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:55,282
Mirek, come away from the window.

43
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,371
Anna, get the door!

44
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,600
Yes?

45
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,081
We are looking for Oldrich Novák.

46
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,767
The Novákovi no longer live here.

47
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,201
Who is it?

48
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,887
Just somebody looking for directions.

49
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:20,201
I am sorry, but that's all I know.

50
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,126
Please.

51
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,770
Can you help us?

52
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:36,040
There is a veterinarian in the next row
of shops up the street.

53
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,122
I hear he is a good man.

54
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,480
One that may help.

55
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,565
Thank you.

56
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,566
He normally only barks at Germans.

57
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:49,486
Mmm-mmm. Germans and anyone
giving him a rectal examination.

58
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,923
Thank you, Dr. Eduard.

59
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,849
Come along, Benés.

60
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:59,048
Look after him, Mrs. Lukešová.

61
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:17,089
Normally, for a dog bite,
you would go to a hospital, not a vet.

62
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,567
Did you know Oldrich Novák?

63
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,641
Yes.

64
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:27,723
And what if we were to say that Oldrich
Novák was our contact here in Prague?

65
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:30,681
Then I would have to wonder

66
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:33,491
if you are ill-informed Czech patriots

67
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:38,001
or Gestapo spies trying to infiltrate
what remains of the resistance.

68
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,929
I don't detect a German accent.

69
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,083
The decoding papers in your bag,
they don't have a German font.

70
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,081
And given that this wound

71
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,970
has more tree bark than dog bite,

72
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:57,043
I would have to guess that you were
parachuted back into Czechoslovakia

73
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,646
with information that
was somewhat out of date.

74
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:02,007
You're a clever man.

75
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,923
We were also told you were a good man.

76
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,363
How long have you been away?

77
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,324
It's been a while.

78
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:13,287
Rewards are given to people
who inform on anti-Nazi activity.

79
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,489
Heydrich has all but crushed
the resistance.

80
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:20,168
He has executed thousands.

81
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:25,488
I can put you in contact with the miller.

82
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:28,007
Maybe he can help you.

83
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,650
You can stay here tonight.

84
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,922
I'll contact the miller in the morning.

85
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:38,565
My friend here says
that you are a clever man.

86
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,771
I agree.

87
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:47,049
Don't do anything that
would change our opinion.

88
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,010
Go easy on the foot.

89
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,686
You will be dancing
the tango within a week.

90
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,089
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

91
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,130
This is Břetislav.

92
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,651
The miller.

93
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,810
Eduard told me you were
looking for Oldrich Novák.

94
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:24,807
Yes.

95
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,687
Would you like to take a drive with me?

96
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,129
Don't move.

97
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,971
Please sit.

98
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,841
You were looking for Oldrich Novák.

99
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,729
Who gave you this contact?

100
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,126
London.

101
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,363
And you tell us this because?

102
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:55,366
You are not giving us much choice and
this doesn't look like Gestapo headquarters.

103
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,761
You, where are you from?

104
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,365
Your accent, Bohemia?

105
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,603
No, Dolní Vilémovice, Moravia.

106
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:07,967
So you must know the railway
station at Vladislav?

107
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,087
Yes.

108
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,730
What's so special about it?

109
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:16,562
I presume you are talking about
the large bed of colored roses

110
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:19,325
that when seen from above
is in the shape of our national flag?

111
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,924
Is it still there?

112
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:27,683
Seems the Germans have still
not looked at it from above.

113
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,770
I am Vanek.

114
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,683
Ladislav Vanek.

115
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,569
This is Uncle Hajsky.

116
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,529
We are the head
of the Jindra Organization.

117
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,806
Czech resistance.

118
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,250
I am Jan Kubiš.

119
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,250
I am Josef Gabčík.

120
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,322
From Slovakia.

121
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:49,371
You must not be surprised
by our lack of trust.

122
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:53,968
The Gestapo have been very successful
in infiltrating our network.

123
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,131
Oldrich Novák.

124
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,328
He was taken away several months ago.

125
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,323
Why wasn't London informed?

126
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:05,804
We lost contact with the Czech government
in exile in London some months ago.

127
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:08,121
We need replacement crystals
for the transmitter.

128
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:11,041
We've been waiting for them to send
someone to re-establish contact.

129
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,248
Is that you?

130
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,481
There were other men on the plane.

131
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:15,721
They were dropped elsewhere.

132
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,325
It's possible they have orders

133
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:20,210
to re-establish contact
with London but that...

134
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,725
That is not our mission.

135
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:25,284
What is your mission?

136
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:31,369
Operation Anthropoid.

137
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,251
Anthropoid?

138
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,088
What is Anthropoid?

139
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,531
We are here to assassinate

140
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,888
SS Obergruppenfűhrer Reinhard Heydrich.

141
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,646
Are you completely mad?

142
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,046
- We have our orders, comrade.
- But this is madness.

143
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,730
We have our orders, comrade.

144
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,960
Heydrich?

145
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,650
Why stop with Heydrich?

146
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,085
Why not have a go at Hitler as well?

147
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:06,200
He is only 300 kilometers down the road
in a small village called Berlin.

148
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:09,323
So we inform London that you are
refusing to cooperate with our mission.

149
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,890
How dare you question us?

150
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:12,641
How dare you question us?

151
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:15,001
You know what we have
sacrificed for the cause here?

152
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,406
What you have sacrificed?

153
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,686
What has Czechoslovakia sacrificed?

154
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,969
You have no idea what we've sacrificed!

155
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:22,684
Sit down. Please.

156
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:33,522
You kill Heydrich and Hitler
will tear Prague apart.

157
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:38,485
I take it you have family
in Czechoslovakia?

158
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,763
Father? Mother?

159
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:45,083
You kill Heydrich, then you can consider them
and everyone that ever knew you dead.

160
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:49,731
All Czech patriots should be
ready to die for their country.

161
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:50,961
That includes my family.

162
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,246
Well, I'm not.

163
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,049
I want to carry on fighting.

164
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:56,851
We don't have that many left
that are willing to do that.

165
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:59,321
We are what's left
of the Czech resistance.

166
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,240
I suggest a lesser rank
should be assassinated.

167
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,526
Perhaps a few of them.

168
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,840
Heydrich is the head of the secret police.

169
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:10,049
Only Hitler and Himmler are
above him in the Nazi hierarchy.

170
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,281
Exactly my point.

171
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,721
You really think you'll ever get close
enough to assassinate Heydrich?

172
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:17,401
Our orders have come direct
from the Czech government in London.

173
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:21,244
So this is about the Czech government
in London trying to impress the allies?

174
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:25,208
It was the allies that gave us
to the Germans in the first place.

175
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,362
Munich was a betrayal,

176
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,205
but it is also now history.

177
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:38,210
I think what the Czech government
in London is asking is this.

178
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:41,964
Is Czechoslovakia

179
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:45,886
still ready and willing
to resist Nazi Germany?

180
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,085
Josef Gabčík.

181
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,964
And Jan Kubiš.

182
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:23,082
You are both most welcome here.

183
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,885
And please call me Auntie Moravec.

184
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,762
Ata. Ata.

185
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,006
Ata is my son.

186
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:33,606
He is studying to be a violinist.

187
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:39,242
Ata, this is Josef and this is Jan.

188
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,606
Pleased to meet you both.

189
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,364
So, try not to go outside,

190
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:46,408
but if you do, never walk together.

191
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:50,524
If you're stopped, you will need
an excuse for why you're not at work.

192
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:53,126
We'll try to get you medical
certificates as soon as possible.

193
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:57,686
Always use our code,
three knocks, then a single knock.

194
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,006
In the meantime,

195
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:02,766
lay low and I will use
Ata to make contact.

196
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,049
Good luck.

197
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,167
Thank you.

198
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,321
Goodbye.

199
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,802
Come on through, please.

200
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,564
Josef.

201
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:27,044
There is a way off the roof?

202
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:29,845
There is a fire escape to the left.

203
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:33,163
To the right it continues
to the building next door.

204
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:36,169
It's good enough.

205
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:42,366
I'm sure you both would
like a glass of Becherovka.

206
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,161
Thank you.

207
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:48,362
- It's okay.
- Mrs. Moravec?

208
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,766
- Hey.
- Hey.

209
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,842
There was so much people at the market.

210
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,526
But I didn't find the bread that you like.

211
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:58,761
Come.

212
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,287
- Who is it?
- It's okay, Marie.

213
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,845
This is Josef and this is Jan.

214
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:10,204
They will be staying with us
while they are looking for work.

215
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,362
- Pleased to meet you.
- Hello.

216
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,849
- Hello.
- Hello.

217
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:20,565
Josef and Jan are not
registered with the police

218
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:24,883
as being residents here, so, remember,
please keep it strictly to yourself.

219
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,361
I'll put the shopping in the kitchen.

220
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,683
Welcome.

221
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:39,204
Mrs. Kovárníková's daughter.
I pay her for helping out.

222
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,204
Dinner will be at 6:00.

223
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:49,686
Please sit.

224
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,286
Ata, dinner is ready.

225
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,166
And finally the fiddler is silent.

226
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,370
He is a violinist, Alois. A violinist.

227
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,924
You two boys looking for work, then?

228
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:19,641
Yes.

229
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:23,930
We are always looking for men to clean
the cinders out of the locomotives.

230
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,287
Thank you, Mr. Moravec.

231
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:28,089
We'll keep that in mind.

232
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:45,204
So, what do you do when you
aren't helping out here?

233
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,121
You don't have a boyfriend?

234
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:57,967
No.

235
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:09,883
How's life in occupied Prague, Marie?

236
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:17,403
I guess, not being registered
with the police as residents

237
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,130
has something to do with this question?

238
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,730
I hate the Germans.

239
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,209
And tell me, do you have a friend

240
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:34,851
as lovely as you that...

241
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,649
That you can trust?

242
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,809
Why?

243
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:43,566
It would be less conspicuous if Jan
and I were not seen out alone.

244
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,651
Young love flourishes
under German occupation.

245
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,449
That sort of thing.

246
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,929
But you're not that young.

247
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:03,008
Knowing that you are trustworthy
is one thing, Marie.

248
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:07,211
But doing this could get you shot.

249
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:09,926
Perhaps you should think about it...

250
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,365
My friend, Lenka.

251
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:16,204
She sometimes carries
messages for Uncle Hajsky.

252
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,527
Good.

253
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:26,562
We are going to a New Year's Eve
dance tomorrow night.

254
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,689
Would you like to go?

255
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,925
Look at them.

256
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,844
It's like...

257
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:51,083
It's like some old ritual
that's lost its joy.

258
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:53,766
Maybe there's hope in the pretense.

259
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:56,926
Hello.

260
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,723
It looks like you've landed
on your feet with Lenka.

261
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,284
This was a mistake.

262
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:18,845
Hello.

263
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:21,764
Lenka, this is Jan and Josef.

264
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:29,169
- You know, it's not very polite...
- Please sit down.

265
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:40,365
You are the most
beautiful women in the room.

266
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,204
Congratulations.

267
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:43,964
But you fail to understand this is...

268
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,731
This is not a night off for us.

269
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,564
This is not some game.

270
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,404
Josef, maybe you're
overreacting a little...

271
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,801
Jan, take a look around.

272
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:01,609
We appreciate the effort, but the point
was not to attract attention.

273
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:04,201
We needed you as plain as possible.

274
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,006
Do you understand?

275
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:10,525
You know, for most girls,

276
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:14,248
a little lipstick is the only way
to forget what's happening here.

277
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,482
Even if it's just for a few hours.

278
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,481
Yes.

279
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:23,291
Your lipstick gets you noticed,

280
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,924
and that gets us noticed,

281
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,446
and us being noticed gets us all shot.

282
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:33,167
This little scene needs an ending.

283
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:37,370
Slap my face.

284
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,685
Slap my face.

285
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,245
I'm not a whore.

286
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:07,129
I think that went well.

287
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:11,890
Nine... Eight... Seven...

288
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:17,490
Six... Five... Four...
Three... Two... One.

289
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,970
A British Sten Mark II machine gun.

290
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:35,243
One hundred rounds.

291
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:41,123
And Model 73 anti-tank
grenades with pencil fuses.

292
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:45,685
That's everything we could retrieve
from the drop canister.

293
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:49,250
Uncle says he has made some progress
with the information you asked for.

294
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:52,164
There is a meeting at Café Moravia
on Vodičkova Street.

295
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,163
Tuesday. 2:00.

296
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:05,410
I just wanted to apologize
about the other night.

297
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,880
You were completely right
to do what you did.

298
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,970
Marie didn't fully inform me
about the situation.

299
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,765
She is very young,

300
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:21,130
she still has romantic ideas
about the war.

301
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:24,966
And you?

302
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,124
War is not romantic.

303
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,044
We cross here.

304
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:46,611
After our last date, I thought you
might both show wearing potato sacks.

305
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,882
I don't know what I'm doing.

306
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,089
You are doing fine.

307
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:07,008
Take a seat here. Order a drink.

308
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:08,846
We won't be long.

309
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,010
Josef.

310
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,526
- Jan.
- Opálka.

311
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,489
Valčík.

312
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:27,524
I see you are no strangers to one another,
but we don't have much time.

313
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,523
We all trained special
operations together.

314
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:32,682
Valčík here was even on the same drop.

315
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:35,969
Yes, dropped 10 minutes later
and 30 miles off course.

316
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,883
Thanks to Valčík and his group Silver A,

317
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:40,850
we have finally re-established
communications with London.

318
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:45,128
I have orders to send and receive any
communications between you and London.

319
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,531
You have your own decoder book, right?

320
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:47,601
Yes.

321
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:50,326
Second Lieutenant Opálka
and Warrant Officer Curda

322
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:54,891
have completed Operation Out Distance,
so both are now available to assist you.

323
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,801
Second Lieutenant Opálka
is the senior officer here.

324
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:01,770
Yes, this is true, but your mission
objective supersedes my rank.

325
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,928
We had word from London. Anthropoid.

326
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,445
Utmost priority.

327
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,648
We assist with everything possible.

328
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:08,721
So...

329
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:09,847
This is your show, bratři.

330
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:15,202
So, we know that Heydrich
returns to his family

331
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:18,363
every day at Panenské Břežany.

332
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:22,161
But, both his chateau and the castle
are both heavily guarded.

333
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,766
They are not feasible targets.

334
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:26,080
But once a month,

335
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:29,369
he also travels to Berlin, by train.

336
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,930
And we can predict this

337
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,846
because his personal carriages
are prepared several days in advance.

338
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:39,167
But, again, the station and the train
are both heavily guarded.

339
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:42,687
What about derailing
the train outside of Prague?

340
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:46,731
We can derail the train, but that is
no guarantee that Heydrich is killed.

341
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:52,645
I have made contact
with an ex-pupil of mine

342
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:56,167
who works as a repair man
inside the castle.

343
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,049
He's willing to help,

344
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:01,124
but he only knows when Heydrich
arrives in the morning

345
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,725
and when he leaves.

346
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:05,164
What good is that?

347
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:08,206
You can build a picture

348
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:09,805
of his routine.

349
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:14,010
Sometimes he travels with an armed
escort and sometimes he does not.

350
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,844
Perhaps there is a pattern in this.

351
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:19,886
There is a safe house near the castle.

352
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:23,282
The repairman could drop off
the timetable every day before work.

353
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:26,327
Lenka or Marie could collect it.

354
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:28,606
Good.

355
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:32,807
And Jan and I will follow the route
from the chateau to the castle.

356
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:36,009
Gentlemen, this operation

357
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:39,408
will involve almost everyone
we have left in the resistance.

358
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,767
So many have been captured by the Gestapo.

359
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:46,288
If you are arrested,
you will face some harsh facts.

360
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:48,522
There will be no escape.

361
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:52,570
You'll be tortured until you reveal
everything you know,

362
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,250
and then you will be executed.

363
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:00,327
You must protect your fellow comrades

364
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,528
by shutting down
any links you have to them.

365
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:06,005
Operation Out Distance
has re-supplied us with these.

366
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:10,090
Carry the cyanide capsules at all times.

367
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,160
We have to end our meeting.

368
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,001
Use the window.

369
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:53,646
Clear.

370
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:09,041
Looks like there's a whole garrison there.

371
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:12,205
That's our man.

372
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:17,324
Five minutes after 9:00.

373
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,924
He's riding solo today.

374
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:23,566
Wait.

375
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:25,770
Armed escort.

376
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,569
Thirty seconds behind.

377
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,611
Thirty seconds.

378
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:32,160
Thirty seconds, 30 seconds.

379
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:37,810
If we can use a rope
or a steel cable to stop the Mercedes,

380
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:40,205
then 30 seconds...

381
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:43,045
Then 30 seconds would be all we need.

382
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:45,248
Even if a rope can stop the car,

383
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:47,561
we still need more than 30 seconds
to escape from here.

384
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:49,842
And we'd have to face the
armed guard here in the open.

385
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:51,081
It would not be my first choice.

386
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:52,924
And if it's our only choice?

387
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:01,169
The point of the mission
is to succeed. Yes?

388
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:03,845
I'm more worried that we haven't planned
what to do if we are successful.

389
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,843
What happens afterwards is not important.

390
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,723
Let's follow the route to the castle.

391
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,281
Well?

392
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:50,162
Arrived 9:15, left 5:15,

393
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:51,321
with an armed escort.

394
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:54,965
Armed escort?

395
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:59,961
There's only one person in Prague
that travels with an armed escort.

396
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:06,043
Are you going to assassinate Heydrich?

397
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,446
What?

398
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:08,965
Heydrich is the target?

399
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:14,808
For your own safety, it's best that
you don't ask too many questions.

400
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:17,287
It's a bit too late for that now.

401
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,727
Well, you agreed to help the resistance.

402
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:21,763
Who the target is should not concern you.

403
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:24,286
We are about to help you
assassinate Reinhard Heydrich.

404
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:26,488
- Of course it concerns us.
- Okay.

405
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,688
Everyone just relax.

406
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:33,842
Maybe it was a mistake
not to inform you of the danger.

407
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,289
- Murder Heydrich?
- No, no.

408
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:38,931
Assassinate Heydrich.

409
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,401
Murder implies he has a life worth living.

410
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:46,611
So you think we are just two little girls

411
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:49,729
who are here to follow the important
parachutists around?

412
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:55,570
Whoa. Lenka.

413
00:37:56,720 --> 00:38:00,042
We've been resisting here
from the beginning in our own way.

414
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:03,249
I personally don't have any
reservation to killing a Nazi pig.

415
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:06,566
But don't treat us like what you are
about to do doesn't affect us.

416
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:07,920
It does and it will.

417
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,571
And you should keep your weapon
clean because it's filthy.

418
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:22,241
Marie?

419
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,087
Where are all my pots and pans?

420
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:08,570
This exit here, is this.

421
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:11,208
You see?

422
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,930
It's the slowest part of the route.

423
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,650
Anywhere else is impossible.

424
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,529
So we do it here.

425
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:19,204
Agreed?

426
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,930
Yes.

427
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,083
Perhaps not perfect,
but it's the best option.

428
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,605
Good.

429
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:20,570
9:17 to 4:41.

430
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:21,687
Without.

431
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:27,131
Are you really going
to go through with this?

432
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:29,806
We have our orders.

433
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:34,601
So, you kill Heydrich.

434
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,291
What then?

435
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:41,607
You think there aren't more like him?

436
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:44,685
They come and the killing continues
even worse than it did before.

437
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:46,046
When does it stop?

438
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:48,888
I wish I had an answer for you.

439
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:52,608
You think any of this makes sense to me?

440
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:54,290
Then walk away now.

441
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:55,725
And go where, Marie?

442
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:01,041
You think we can escape
from what is happening here?

443
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:03,766
Pretend this madness is not real?

444
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:06,571
Some days I'm not even sure it is real.

445
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:12,283
Heydrich chokes the people
of this city with a blanket of fear.

446
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:14,010
People are shot for what?

447
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:18,722
Their race? Their religion?
Their cigarettes?

448
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:22,567
You hear the stories about Poland.

449
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:25,525
Marie, it's okay.

450
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:29,530
Just tell me we are doing the right thing.

451
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:44,484
I think it is my turn to apologize
to you about the other morning.

452
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:46,090
You were right to be angry.

453
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:49,371
We should have told you what was at risk.

454
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:50,771
Given you the choice to walk away.

455
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:55,326
My father was a captain in the army.

456
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:57,528
Wanted sons, got three daughters.

457
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:01,283
He and many others were arrested in '39

458
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:04,409
when Germany took control
over Czechoslovakia.

459
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:09,611
And when Heydrich took
over here last September,

460
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:12,610
his first order was to
execute all the prisoners.

461
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:17,810
My father was among 5,000 shot
in the first week by Heydrich.

462
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:21,283
For me there's no walking away.

463
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:24,249
Heydrich is worth the risk.

464
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,131
We have checked the route.

465
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,609
We think we know how to do it.

466
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:48,045
I will arrange a meeting.

467
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:50,361
At the cafe, the day after tomorrow.

468
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:52,366
3:00 p.m.

469
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:58,726
Our original contact, Oldrich Novák.

470
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:01,849
Who was his direct handler?

471
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:07,329
Ladislav Vanek.

472
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:11,808
He is the one who's most opposed
to what we have to do.

473
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:23,690
All I'm asking is what is he so afraid of?

474
00:43:57,320 --> 00:43:58,731
Jan?

475
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:00,806
Sorry.

476
00:44:57,080 --> 00:44:58,684
So he approaches here.

477
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:01,485
Corner of Kirchmayer
and Holeschowitzer Street.

478
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:02,726
Here.

479
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:05,121
Yes, his car will have to really
slow down to take that corner.

480
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:07,965
Yes, he slows to about 10 miles per hour.

481
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:10,407
We've averaged out
his morning arrival times.

482
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:13,330
We can expect him
at approximately 9:30 a.m.

483
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:14,481
And the weapons?

484
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:17,285
At that range the Sten gun should hit
everything within the car.

485
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:19,324
And the armed escort?

486
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:24,723
We have found no pattern.

487
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:26,564
Some days, yes. Some days, no.

488
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:32,887
If there is an armed escort,

489
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:36,322
we stand down and await the next day.

490
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:39,047
You know I have been against
this action from the start.

491
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:40,924
Yes, that's been clear.

492
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:44,005
I cannot give the go-ahead
without asking London to reconsider.

493
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:46,606
Ladislav, this is a military operation.
It's not your order to give...

494
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:48,802
Without the resistance,
this mission doesn't exist.

495
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:49,881
Do you want to put...

496
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:51,086
I am with Ladislav.

497
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:54,321
We should get London to rethink
our position here in Prague.

498
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:56,608
We have our orders, Curda.
And nothing has changed.

499
00:45:56,680 --> 00:45:58,170
It's easy for London to give orders.

500
00:45:58,240 --> 00:45:59,401
It's our lives on the line...

501
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:01,084
Let's wait for re-confirmation.

502
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:02,446
We waited four months.

503
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:03,601
Four months.

504
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:06,050
London needs action.

505
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:07,486
Then a few more days
won't make a difference.

506
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:10,928
Valčík, how long before you
can get to the transmitter?

507
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,526
I can get to the transmitter
the day after tomorrow.

508
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:17,444
Then a couple of days for London
to transmit back the answer.

509
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:25,481
Happy birthday.

510
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:27,608
- Happy birthday.
- Happy birthday.

511
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:39,568
- Happy birthday, Ata.
- Thank you.

512
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:41,846
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

513
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:43,001
Cheers.

514
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:46,050
Cheers.

515
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:54,802
- It's beautiful.
- Thank you.

516
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:58,521
Uh...

517
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:03,450
Ata, I know this is your party,

518
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:06,402
but we have a little announcement to make.

519
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:13,689
I have asked Marie to marry me
and she has said yes.

520
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:17,009
Congratulations.

521
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:19,924
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

522
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,923
Thank you.

523
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:39,405
Congratulations.

524
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:42,687
Thank you.

525
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:46,803
Why are we here?

526
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:50,201
Hmm?

527
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:52,645
I know.

528
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:56,371
I know.

529
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:02,005
Who's to say it won't happen?

530
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:04,087
London calls it off.

531
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:06,128
You're lying to yourself, my friend.

532
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:10,891
Because it is easier.

533
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:24,167
I have to believe
there is a way through this.

534
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:26,925
That there is a normal life
waiting for us.

535
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,240
The way things used to be.

536
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:37,408
Marie makes me feel that there is hope.

537
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:43,731
I love her.

538
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:48,570
I do. I love her.

539
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:14,371
I had the idea to transfer the 73

540
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:18,084
into a water canteen for better mobility.

541
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:21,042
Rigged for impact detonation.

542
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:23,291
Don't drop them, eh?

543
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:30,331
That was the empty one.

544
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:35,561
No, not funny, Jan.

545
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:38,440
Not funny.

546
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:40,522
"Anthropoid proceed.

547
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:42,646
"Stop.

548
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,651
"Upmost importance."

549
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:51,366
Nothing about getting us out afterwards.

550
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:21,564
There's a problem.

551
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:27,287
One of our contacts inside
the castle has seen correspondence

552
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:29,522
ordering Heydrich back to Berlin.

553
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:34,651
And there have been
conversations in the household

554
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:38,010
about a new posting to Paris.

555
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:42,931
It means that once he goes
to Berlin, he may not be back.

556
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:45,201
When does he leave?

557
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:47,451
Day after tomorrow.

558
00:51:50,120 --> 00:51:51,565
Then we have no choice.

559
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:53,600
We do it tomorrow.

560
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:56,490
We do it tomorrow.

561
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:00,845
What? What is it?

562
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:06,688
Ladislav has received
a new transmission from London.

563
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:08,681
And?

564
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:12,287
They agreed with my request
to stand down the mission.

565
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:18,843
We believe we see the situation clearly,
therefore, given the situation,

566
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:21,924
any actions against officials
of the German Reich

567
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,287
do not come into consideration.

568
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:26,164
Let the Jindra group know.

569
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:29,403
No.

570
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:36,365
Ladislav,

571
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:41,367
I've just decoded a message from London.

572
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:44,240
"Proceed. Upmost importance."

573
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:47,403
But this clearly states
you must stand down.

574
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:50,006
You are deluded. This is for Jindra.

575
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:51,286
So how can we recognize this?

576
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:54,170
Then at least wait for us to clarify it.

577
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:56,049
It may have superseded your order.

578
00:52:56,120 --> 00:52:57,884
We have no time.

579
00:52:57,960 --> 00:53:00,088
After tomorrow Heydrich will be gone.

580
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:03,125
I agree with Josef.

581
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:09,165
I don't think this is a direct command.

582
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:13,768
I believe its purpose
is to calm the nerves in Jindra.

583
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:15,001
I know you all doubt me.

584
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:17,407
- No, Ladislav...
- Please stop.

585
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:22,087
Suspect me of collaboration.

586
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:23,491
I know you've had me followed.

587
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:29,287
I understand you don't trust me, but,

588
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:32,126
if I was an informer for the Gestapo,
do you think you would still be here?

589
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:33,281
Do you?

590
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:37,602
Then you tell me, Ladislav.

591
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:42,290
What are you afraid of?

592
00:53:53,560 --> 00:53:56,769
I fear Czechoslovakia
will be wiped from the map.

593
00:53:58,520 --> 00:54:00,329
You ask me if I'm afraid?

594
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:01,970
Yes, I'm afraid.

595
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:20,367
Jan, Uncle, we do it tomorrow.

596
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:23,121
As planned.

597
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,411
May God be with you.

598
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:46,086
Jan.

599
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:49,887
I've shot at men in the field.
Never killed one up close.

600
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:54,244
Give me the gun. Give me the gun.

601
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:56,049
- I don't want to die tomorrow.
- Give me the gun.

602
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:03,082
Breathe. Breathe.

603
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:05,526
Now...

604
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:09,126
Thank you, Mrs. Moravec. Thank you.

605
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:11,925
Okay. Breathe. Breathe.

606
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,604
Breathe. Breathe, Jan.

607
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:15,761
Good.

608
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:28,641
Now, as we were trained.

609
00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:33,128
As we were trained.
Concentrate on the detail.

610
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:36,441
Good.

611
00:55:37,080 --> 00:55:38,241
Good.

612
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,126
Good.

613
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:44,843
We are not afraid.

614
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:47,491
Jan, we are not afraid.

615
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:51,051
Czechoslovakia is not afraid.

616
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:54,121
Huh?

617
00:57:09,240 --> 00:57:11,288
I will wait for you up the street.

618
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:21,444
Uncle said we weren't needed for a while.

619
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:23,204
Is it today?

620
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:28,401
Promise me.

621
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:56,804
We have plenty of time.

622
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:58,211
8:25.

623
00:59:00,560 --> 00:59:01,641
Where's Curda?

624
00:59:08,080 --> 00:59:09,570
Never mind.

625
00:59:09,640 --> 00:59:11,961
Valčík, you take this street behind me.

626
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:16,566
We have some sun, so take this.

627
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:21,801
If he approaches without an armed escort,
then use it to signal.

628
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:22,881
And if he does?

629
00:59:24,440 --> 00:59:26,602
Then... Then light a cigarette.

630
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:30,121
When the car slows to take the corner,

631
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:32,328
I will step out and open fire
with the Sten gun.

632
00:59:33,240 --> 00:59:35,447
This will signal the attack.

633
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:38,285
Jan, you stand behind the attack point

634
00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:41,489
so you can throw grenades
at the armed escort if there is one.

635
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:47,010
Opálka, you try a slow walk across here.

636
00:59:47,080 --> 00:59:50,685
As he approaches, maybe you can
slow him down before he takes the corner.

637
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:53,725
Is that clear?

638
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:54,847
Yeah.

639
00:59:56,640 --> 00:59:57,641
Good luck.

640
01:01:02,560 --> 01:01:04,608
- All good?
- Good.

641
01:01:52,920 --> 01:01:54,649
As we were trained.

642
01:04:00,600 --> 01:04:02,125
Let's move!

643
01:04:44,720 --> 01:04:46,290
Stop!

644
01:05:50,240 --> 01:05:51,480
Where were you, Curda?

645
01:05:51,560 --> 01:05:53,927
I didn't think that you
were really going to do it.

646
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:55,684
It's all over the radio. You shot him?

647
01:05:56,880 --> 01:06:00,649
The radio said 20,000 SS troops
have been drafted in to look for us.

648
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:02,210
I need to get my family out of Prague.

649
01:06:02,280 --> 01:06:03,281
No, Curda.

650
01:06:03,360 --> 01:06:05,283
No one is going anywhere, Curda.

651
01:06:05,360 --> 01:06:08,410
You try and run now and they will
pick you up before you reach the city limits.

652
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:11,768
You go home to your family,
you stay calm, you shut your mouth.

653
01:06:11,880 --> 01:06:13,803
- You think you can do that? Huh?
- Yeah.

654
01:06:20,920 --> 01:06:23,651
- We failed, Curda.
- Failed? No.

655
01:06:24,920 --> 01:06:26,081
We failed.

656
01:06:41,600 --> 01:06:42,647
Jan?

657
01:06:43,640 --> 01:06:44,721
Jan.

658
01:06:50,920 --> 01:06:52,490
The Sten...

659
01:06:52,560 --> 01:06:53,561
I'm sorry.

660
01:07:07,320 --> 01:07:10,608
Karl Frank has temporarily
taken Heydrich's place,

661
01:07:11,120 --> 01:07:14,886
and has proclaimed a state
of emergency and a curfew.

662
01:07:15,960 --> 01:07:20,568
A reward of 10 million crowns
will be given for any information

663
01:07:20,680 --> 01:07:23,206
that leads to the arrest of the criminals.

664
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:25,601
Anyone caught aiding the criminals

665
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:29,480
will be shot,
along with his entire family.

666
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:31,081
What went wrong out there?

667
01:07:50,480 --> 01:07:51,686
We didn't even kill him.

668
01:07:56,040 --> 01:07:57,166
Wounded.

669
01:07:58,440 --> 01:07:59,601
How bad?

670
01:08:01,600 --> 01:08:02,840
It's hard to say.

671
01:08:04,360 --> 01:08:07,284
The SS still have the hospital surrounded,

672
01:08:07,360 --> 01:08:10,443
so presumably, he's still alive.

673
01:08:12,160 --> 01:08:15,846
It seems like the Germans have
more men and guns up there

674
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:17,809
than on the Eastern Front.

675
01:08:21,440 --> 01:08:23,841
They have taken several thousand hostages.

676
01:08:25,640 --> 01:08:27,165
So, what do we do now?

677
01:08:28,520 --> 01:08:32,206
Nothing is leaving or entering Prague.

678
01:08:34,520 --> 01:08:36,522
They are searching door to door.

679
01:08:38,800 --> 01:08:41,121
We have no safe houses left.

680
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:43,846
So, where do we go?

681
01:08:45,080 --> 01:08:47,606
I've asked Father Vladimir Petrek.

682
01:08:48,160 --> 01:08:50,049
He has agreed to hide

683
01:08:50,120 --> 01:08:53,647
all the parachutists
that are still here in Prague

684
01:08:53,720 --> 01:08:56,485
until we can return you to London.

685
01:08:57,680 --> 01:09:00,411
Wait here, a few hours.

686
01:09:00,480 --> 01:09:03,450
I will find a safe route to the cathedral.

687
01:09:35,560 --> 01:09:36,925
Hey.

688
01:09:50,920 --> 01:09:52,922
Tell me.

689
01:09:55,320 --> 01:09:57,243
Tell me.

690
01:09:57,320 --> 01:09:59,049
- Marie. Marie.
- Marie.

691
01:09:59,120 --> 01:10:01,202
- Marie. Marie.
- Marie.

692
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:03,601
It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay. It's okay.

693
01:10:10,360 --> 01:10:15,366
The Germans were rounding up
hostages off the street and...

694
01:10:17,280 --> 01:10:20,568
She tried to escape.

695
01:10:26,840 --> 01:10:28,330
It's okay.

696
01:10:35,120 --> 01:10:37,441
It's okay. It's okay.

697
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,571
- Josef.
- Jan!

698
01:10:49,680 --> 01:10:52,604
Stop. Stop. Josef, stop.

699
01:10:52,720 --> 01:10:54,609
- Stop! Josef.
- It's my fault.

700
01:10:54,680 --> 01:10:56,205
- Josef, it's not your fault.
- It's my fault.

701
01:10:56,280 --> 01:10:57,566
Josef, listen to me!

702
01:10:57,640 --> 01:10:59,324
- Listen to me.
- It's my fault.

703
01:10:59,440 --> 01:11:02,046
Stop! Listen to me. Listen to me.

704
01:11:03,720 --> 01:11:05,404
You're risking the lives of everyone.

705
01:11:05,480 --> 01:11:08,324
For what? To shoot a few Germans?

706
01:11:09,320 --> 01:11:12,005
She's gone. Josef, she's gone.

707
01:11:13,160 --> 01:11:16,164
It's not your fault. Huh?

708
01:11:16,280 --> 01:11:18,328
- It's my fault.
- It's not your fault.

709
01:11:19,840 --> 01:11:21,365
- It's my fault.
- It's not your fault, Josef.

710
01:11:21,440 --> 01:11:23,329
It's not your fault, okay.

711
01:11:41,960 --> 01:11:43,962
I am sorry, Jan.

712
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:51,522
I'm sorry, Marie.

713
01:11:53,320 --> 01:11:55,322
Mrs. Moravec, I'm sorry.

714
01:12:04,600 --> 01:12:05,681
Hey.

715
01:12:07,040 --> 01:12:10,408
Hey, it's okay. It's okay.

716
01:12:10,680 --> 01:12:12,205
It's okay.

717
01:13:43,320 --> 01:13:45,448
Father Petrek will meet you in there.

718
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:47,921
I'll send food with Ata. Go, go.

719
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,367
Thank you.

720
01:13:50,480 --> 01:13:52,482
I regret nothing.

721
01:13:53,120 --> 01:13:54,804
You are the bravest men I have ever met.

722
01:14:43,120 --> 01:14:46,090
I'm Father Petrek. Welcome.

723
01:14:47,760 --> 01:14:49,683
Please, come with me.

724
01:14:58,280 --> 01:15:02,569
This is our hidden crypt.
You will be safe there.

725
01:15:03,640 --> 01:15:05,642
Thank you, Father.

726
01:15:39,880 --> 01:15:41,405
You made it.

727
01:15:44,480 --> 01:15:45,720
Josef.

728
01:15:46,600 --> 01:15:47,681
Gentlemen.

729
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:50,491
This is Švarc, Bublík and Hrubý.

730
01:15:50,560 --> 01:15:52,688
They are from the airdrop this spring.

731
01:15:55,320 --> 01:15:57,846
Boredom may be the biggest
enemy we have here.

732
01:15:57,920 --> 01:16:01,289
I'm suggesting three men on guard duty
in the nave balcony at all times.

733
01:16:01,360 --> 01:16:03,408
We rotate every six hours.

734
01:16:03,480 --> 01:16:05,323
These three take first watch.

735
01:16:18,160 --> 01:16:20,845
I'm sorry it wasn't the outcome
we all hoped for.

736
01:16:23,160 --> 01:16:25,083
None more than us.

737
01:17:22,960 --> 01:17:25,725
Reinhard Heydrich has died in hospital.

738
01:17:28,320 --> 01:17:30,926
A direct result of the injuries
sustained in the attack.

739
01:17:40,640 --> 01:17:46,090
Yesterday, the Germans
went to a village, Lidice,

740
01:17:46,160 --> 01:17:48,925
and shot every man over the age of 16.

741
01:17:50,440 --> 01:17:54,286
The women and children
have been taken to camps,

742
01:17:54,560 --> 01:17:56,449
and the buildings
were razed to the ground.

743
01:17:58,880 --> 01:18:01,929
There has been talk that the village
aided you somehow.

744
01:18:03,680 --> 01:18:05,648
I've never even been to Lidice.

745
01:18:08,720 --> 01:18:11,326
These are dangerous times.

746
01:18:11,400 --> 01:18:14,882
Mere gossip wipes a whole village
from the face of the Earth.

747
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:19,291
Today Karl Frank issued
an amnesty broadcast.

748
01:18:20,320 --> 01:18:22,800
A full pardon for any person
and their family

749
01:18:22,920 --> 01:18:26,606
in exchange for any information
about the assassins,

750
01:18:26,760 --> 01:18:29,366
even if they did not come forward before.

751
01:18:31,360 --> 01:18:34,728
But there is a deadline of five days.

752
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:39,203
After that, they plan
to execute 30,000 Czechs.

753
01:18:44,400 --> 01:18:47,768
- This must stop.
- What do you propose?

754
01:18:52,680 --> 01:18:55,490
Me and Josef will go to a park,

755
01:18:55,560 --> 01:18:58,006
place placards around our necks
saying that we killed Heydrich

756
01:18:58,240 --> 01:18:59,480
and commit suicide.

757
01:18:59,560 --> 01:19:00,561
- Jan.
- Stupid talk.

758
01:19:00,640 --> 01:19:02,244
This is stupid talk.

759
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:07,687
As a soldier, it is your duty to
stay alive and continue fighting.

760
01:19:09,120 --> 01:19:11,327
Do you understand that,
Warrant Officer Kubiš?

761
01:19:17,840 --> 01:19:20,923
The responsibility does not rest with you.

762
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:23,002
We know who is responsible.

763
01:19:23,440 --> 01:19:26,842
They will have to answer
eventually, and they will.

764
01:19:27,320 --> 01:19:31,848
If I didn't believe that,
I would not be here now.

765
01:19:33,600 --> 01:19:34,931
Thank you, Father.

766
01:20:06,480 --> 01:20:08,244
Ata.

767
01:20:10,680 --> 01:20:12,489
Have you seen Marie?

768
01:20:15,080 --> 01:20:16,570
Is she well?

769
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:07,604
Beyond this brickwork and masonry,

770
01:21:07,680 --> 01:21:09,842
there is a large main sewer
that empties into the river.

771
01:21:10,680 --> 01:21:11,806
How do you know?

772
01:21:11,880 --> 01:21:14,724
I found some plans
in Father Petrek's office.

773
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:18,441
Now, if we can chisel through this,
we have a means of escape.

774
01:21:18,560 --> 01:21:19,641
Escape to where?

775
01:21:19,720 --> 01:21:22,606
Well, until the British send plans
for our rescue, we are stuck here.

776
01:21:22,680 --> 01:21:24,648
But should we be discovered,
there is no way out.

777
01:21:24,720 --> 01:21:27,007
I would like us at least
to have this option.

778
01:21:27,280 --> 01:21:29,647
We would then
take our chances in the streets.

779
01:21:29,720 --> 01:21:31,768
Two men should be
working here at all times.

780
01:21:52,280 --> 01:21:53,486
What's her name?

781
01:22:05,680 --> 01:22:06,681
Lenka.

782
01:22:15,480 --> 01:22:18,245
Earlier, what Jan said...

783
01:22:22,920 --> 01:22:25,366
About taking your own lives.

784
01:22:28,360 --> 01:22:29,850
Was he serious?

785
01:22:38,680 --> 01:22:40,250
Maybe.

786
01:22:53,200 --> 01:22:56,443
"Cowards die many times
before their deaths.

787
01:22:57,440 --> 01:23:00,523
"The valiant never taste death but once."

788
01:23:03,320 --> 01:23:04,401
Shakespeare.

789
01:23:22,280 --> 01:23:24,930
You say you know the men who assassinated

790
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,606
Reichsprotektor Reinhard Heydrich,

791
01:23:27,720 --> 01:23:29,722
but you didn't take part in it.

792
01:23:38,200 --> 01:23:41,921
You say you don't know where they are,
but you know the family who sheltered them.

793
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,002
No, please... Please, no.

794
01:23:48,520 --> 01:23:53,048
You walked in here on your own accord
to give us this statement.

795
01:23:53,120 --> 01:23:56,124
You say you are a true patriot
and the reason for doing that

796
01:23:56,200 --> 01:23:59,204
is because you want to protect your family

797
01:23:59,280 --> 01:24:02,363
and for the killing
of innocent Czechs to stop.

798
01:24:04,920 --> 01:24:06,524
And you say your name is...

799
01:24:07,840 --> 01:24:09,285
Karel Curda.

800
01:25:43,560 --> 01:25:44,721
Chalupský.

801
01:25:50,280 --> 01:25:51,884
Ah!

802
01:26:02,400 --> 01:26:03,845
Where are the parachutists?

803
01:26:06,840 --> 01:26:09,411
I know nothing.

804
01:26:09,560 --> 01:26:11,927
You must be confusing us
with other Moravecs.

805
01:26:33,320 --> 01:26:34,321
Where are the parachutists?

806
01:26:52,960 --> 01:26:56,965
Please, let me clean
myself up before I leave.

807
01:26:57,360 --> 01:26:59,010
Go on, then.

808
01:27:03,760 --> 01:27:06,081
My son is a violinist.

809
01:27:06,160 --> 01:27:11,041
Tell them he knows
nothing of this. Please.

810
01:27:59,480 --> 01:28:00,925
In the toilet.

811
01:28:35,760 --> 01:28:36,761
Something triggered it.

812
01:28:36,840 --> 01:28:38,683
Maybe other members
of the church found out.

813
01:28:38,760 --> 01:28:41,923
Opálka. What did I miss?

814
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:43,923
Bishop Gorazd has talked to Father Petrek.

815
01:28:44,200 --> 01:28:46,328
Apparently our presence here
is endangering the church.

816
01:28:46,400 --> 01:28:48,368
He wants us to leave.

817
01:28:48,440 --> 01:28:52,287
But Petrek has talked to Hajsky
and there is a plan to get us all out.

818
01:28:53,280 --> 01:28:54,930
When?

819
01:28:56,600 --> 01:29:00,848
Two in the coffins,
two under the dummy floors

820
01:29:00,920 --> 01:29:04,083
and the other three
disguised as pall bearers.

821
01:29:04,160 --> 01:29:05,286
That's the seven.

822
01:29:12,680 --> 01:29:14,682
How soon can you be ready?

823
01:29:37,440 --> 01:29:38,965
You like to play the violin.

824
01:30:13,440 --> 01:30:16,011
Maybe you would like
to see your mother again.

825
01:30:17,080 --> 01:30:19,447
Yes, we managed to save her.

826
01:30:21,320 --> 01:30:23,129
No. No.

827
01:30:24,080 --> 01:30:25,809
- No.
- We saved her head.

828
01:30:28,080 --> 01:30:30,082
Where are the assassins?

829
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:32,411
Where are the assassins?

830
01:30:33,520 --> 01:30:37,320
Where are they hiding?

831
01:30:37,400 --> 01:30:39,129
Please stop.

832
01:30:39,200 --> 01:30:42,647
Where are the assassins?
Where are they hiding?

833
01:30:42,760 --> 01:30:44,444
- Stop.
- Where are they?

834
01:30:44,520 --> 01:30:46,522
They're in the church.

835
01:30:52,520 --> 01:30:55,171
In the Cyril and Methodius Church.

836
01:32:21,120 --> 01:32:22,201
The Germans are surrounding the church.

837
01:32:22,280 --> 01:32:23,361
We have to warn the others.

838
01:32:23,440 --> 01:32:25,283
No, no. There is no time.

839
01:32:25,360 --> 01:32:27,362
Take up defensive positions.
We hold them from here.

840
01:32:27,440 --> 01:32:29,249
Bublík, take the upper gallery.

841
01:33:01,480 --> 01:33:02,720
Go back.

842
01:33:06,680 --> 01:33:09,001
Back! Go back!

843
01:34:11,880 --> 01:34:14,611
- The church is surrounded.
- We have to help them.

844
01:34:14,720 --> 01:34:16,768
We must not give ourselves away, Josef.

845
01:34:21,760 --> 01:34:22,921
- Jan!
- Hey!

846
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:25,446
- Jan!
- Keep quiet, please.

847
01:35:18,960 --> 01:35:20,371
Block the stairwell.

848
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:30,286
That's our only way out.

849
01:35:31,520 --> 01:35:33,170
It's also the only way up.

850
01:36:09,680 --> 01:36:10,681
Bublík!

851
01:36:13,520 --> 01:36:15,522
Bublík!

852
01:36:21,920 --> 01:36:23,922
- I don't want to die.
- Bublík, look at me.

853
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:24,967
- I don't want to die.
- Breathe.

854
01:36:25,040 --> 01:36:26,530
Breathe with me. With me.

855
01:36:26,600 --> 01:36:32,881
Big breath in. Big breath out.

856
01:36:33,120 --> 01:36:36,408
I don't want to die today.
I don't want to die today.

857
01:36:36,560 --> 01:36:38,961
- I don't want to die today.
- As we were trained.

858
01:36:39,040 --> 01:36:40,724
- As we were trained.
- As we were trained.

859
01:36:41,680 --> 01:36:43,762
Here. Look.

860
01:36:44,080 --> 01:36:47,801
Nice and easy. Nice and easy.

861
01:36:47,880 --> 01:36:49,803
Concentrate on the detail. Come on.

862
01:36:50,720 --> 01:36:52,722
- That's it.
- I'm sorry, Jan.

863
01:36:55,280 --> 01:36:56,884
Okay?

864
01:36:57,240 --> 01:36:58,571
Nice and easy.

865
01:37:00,160 --> 01:37:02,128
Yeah.

866
01:37:06,920 --> 01:37:11,403
We're all here with you.
And Czechoslovakia is here with us.

867
01:38:52,400 --> 01:38:54,164
Cover the stairwell!

868
01:40:14,440 --> 01:40:16,522
Bublík, the stairwell!

869
01:40:20,920 --> 01:40:22,046
We've lost the stairwell!

870
01:41:42,960 --> 01:41:44,007
Stairs!

871
01:41:52,200 --> 01:41:54,202
I'm out!

872
01:41:55,360 --> 01:41:56,407
Last one.

873
01:42:52,040 --> 01:42:53,246
Bublík!

874
01:45:03,040 --> 01:45:05,042
This is Jan Kubiš.

875
01:45:07,440 --> 01:45:09,329
That's Adolf Opálka.

876
01:45:10,040 --> 01:45:11,485
And him,

877
01:45:11,760 --> 01:45:15,287
I don't know, but it's not
Josef Gabčík or Valčík.

878
01:45:29,920 --> 01:45:31,604
Wait. Wait.

879
01:45:43,240 --> 01:45:44,571
Hrubý, reload.

880
01:46:06,960 --> 01:46:08,883
You should get your friends to surrender.

881
01:46:11,360 --> 01:46:12,407
Josef?

882
01:46:13,880 --> 01:46:15,450
You should surrender now
and save yourselves.

883
01:46:15,960 --> 01:46:17,689
- There's Curda.
- Do you hear me?

884
01:46:18,280 --> 01:46:20,123
- Curda!
- Curda!

885
01:46:23,080 --> 01:46:25,606
You will be treated humanely
as prisoners of war.

886
01:46:25,800 --> 01:46:27,006
We are Czechs.

887
01:46:29,600 --> 01:46:30,806
We will never surrender!

888
01:47:05,160 --> 01:47:06,161
Hey.

889
01:47:10,120 --> 01:47:11,201
We save the last one...

890
01:47:13,040 --> 01:47:14,041
For us.

891
01:48:05,080 --> 01:48:07,526
We dig! We dig!

892
01:48:13,120 --> 01:48:15,726
Keep digging! Don't stop!
