1
00:01:43,705 --> 00:01:45,707
- I already told you.

2
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:47,107
I don't speak Spanish.

3
00:01:49,443 --> 00:01:52,379
If I could just call my embassy.

4
00:02:27,882 --> 00:02:29,282
- You had the wrong guy.

5
00:02:31,886 --> 00:02:33,286
I'm just a tourist.

6
00:02:37,491 --> 00:02:39,192
Would you stop hitting me?

7
00:02:40,962 --> 00:02:42,496
Doesn't anyone
here speak English?

8
00:02:50,138 --> 00:02:54,942
- Yes, we do speak
English, Mr. Smith.

9
00:02:56,611 --> 00:02:58,780
But I know that
you speak Spanish.

10
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:03,417
And I know that you
are an assassin.

11
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:09,857
The only thing I don't
know is who's paying you

12
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:12,359
and who sent you.

13
00:03:14,327 --> 00:03:18,666
But believe me, you
are going to tell me.

14
00:04:01,943 --> 00:04:03,544
- He was like my brother.

15
00:04:09,483 --> 00:04:11,652
- You're making a mistake.

16
00:05:25,893 --> 00:05:28,563
- The killing has
never been the hard part...

17
00:05:31,799 --> 00:05:32,767
It's the repeating.

18
00:05:34,936 --> 00:05:38,940
Find... Kill... Repeat.

19
00:06:13,641 --> 00:06:14,474
- Smith.

20
00:08:55,302 --> 00:08:57,271
- Howard, you are late.

21
00:08:57,304 --> 00:08:58,939
Do you have it?

22
00:08:58,973 --> 00:09:00,775
Then plug it in.

23
00:09:00,808 --> 00:09:05,546
And don't unplug it until you
have seen it all completed.

24
00:09:08,517 --> 00:09:10,284
- 20%...

25
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:13,721
30%...

26
00:09:16,323 --> 00:09:17,191
40%...

27
00:09:18,492 --> 00:09:19,660
60%...

28
00:09:20,394 --> 00:09:21,328
70%...

29
00:09:22,863 --> 00:09:23,731
80%...

30
00:09:25,332 --> 00:09:30,337
Upload complete.

31
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:00,000
- Keepin' the doctor away?

32
00:10:01,268 --> 00:10:02,736
- Pardon?

33
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:05,840
- With the apples. Isn't
that how the saying goes?

34
00:10:05,873 --> 00:10:08,642
- There's fourteen ways to
kill a man with an apple.

35
00:10:11,546 --> 00:10:13,247
Seventeen if the
stem is still in.

36
00:10:20,054 --> 00:10:21,222
Just kidding.

37
00:10:21,255 --> 00:10:24,058
- You are so funny.

38
00:10:24,091 --> 00:10:27,094
Do you need a bag,
sweetie, or anything else?

39
00:10:27,128 --> 00:10:28,629
- No, thank you.

40
00:10:51,051 --> 00:10:52,086
- Hey, Mikey.

41
00:10:53,754 --> 00:10:55,256
- Hey, thanks, man.

42
00:12:11,999 --> 00:12:14,502
- Hey, Howard. Your usual?
- Hi.

43
00:12:14,536 --> 00:12:16,504
- Coffee black?
- No, nothing today.

44
00:12:17,771 --> 00:12:18,806
- Okay.

45
00:12:20,709 --> 00:12:21,509
- So?

46
00:12:22,743 --> 00:12:25,846
- He's, um, over there
sitting at the booth.

47
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:31,185
Howard, you're doing okay?

48
00:12:31,218 --> 00:12:32,520
- Yeah, I'm good.

49
00:12:32,554 --> 00:12:35,523
- Are you sure?
- I'm good.

50
00:12:35,557 --> 00:12:36,890
- He's been here over an hour.

51
00:12:38,392 --> 00:12:39,561
I'm here if you need anything.

52
00:12:39,594 --> 00:12:40,394
- Yeah.

53
00:12:49,671 --> 00:12:50,437
- Pete?

54
00:12:51,438 --> 00:12:52,239
- Sure.

55
00:12:57,378 --> 00:13:00,381
Looks like you got yourself
in a bad spot, old man.

56
00:13:01,549 --> 00:13:02,883
- Do you have them?

57
00:13:03,551 --> 00:13:04,719
- What?

58
00:13:04,753 --> 00:13:06,820
- Money. Passport. Tickets.

59
00:13:07,454 --> 00:13:08,289
- I do have.

60
00:13:09,591 --> 00:13:12,026
- What does that
mean? Where are they?

61
00:13:12,059 --> 00:13:14,529
- Nearby. I have to
check the codes first.

62
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:17,865
- That wasn't the deal, okay?

63
00:13:17,898 --> 00:13:21,035
I said you get nothing until
I see passport and money.

64
00:13:34,516 --> 00:13:35,684
- The decryption codes, Howard.

65
00:13:35,717 --> 00:13:37,552
- Look, I got people chasing me.

66
00:13:37,585 --> 00:13:39,053
I gotta get out of town.

67
00:13:39,086 --> 00:13:41,523
I don't have time for this,
okay? I'm out of here.

68
00:13:47,227 --> 00:13:50,264
- Do yourself a favor,
Howard. Be smart.

69
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:54,101
- Is everything okay, sir?

70
00:13:57,471 --> 00:13:58,606
- Sound is apparent enough.

71
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,242
- Hey, it's a nice day outside.

72
00:14:02,276 --> 00:14:04,478
We should go for a walk
and talk about this.

73
00:14:13,788 --> 00:14:14,622
Let's go.

74
00:14:18,926 --> 00:14:20,762
- Sorry, gents, but
I can't let you leave

75
00:14:20,795 --> 00:14:23,497
until I've had a few
words with this fella.

76
00:14:58,165 --> 00:15:02,302
Motherfucker.

77
00:15:43,511 --> 00:15:44,679
- You, get up.

78
00:16:01,596 --> 00:16:04,064
Your name is Howard, right?

79
00:16:16,778 --> 00:16:17,612
Quality.

80
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:23,685
Let me guess.

81
00:16:24,919 --> 00:16:28,923
Rich mommy and daddy.
Ivy League education.

82
00:16:28,957 --> 00:16:31,559
Pretty little wife.
Couple of kids at home.

83
00:16:31,593 --> 00:16:33,994
Now why the fuck would
you keep that out.

84
00:16:47,174 --> 00:16:48,776
You know my problem is, Howard?

85
00:16:51,011 --> 00:16:53,013
I've been a contractor
for a very long time.

86
00:16:54,448 --> 00:16:57,785
Much of it for good man
who takes good care of me.

87
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:01,990
The same man that
gave you a job.

88
00:17:02,022 --> 00:17:04,024
I've been looking after you.

89
00:17:05,727 --> 00:17:07,294
We'll get on of it now, huh?

90
00:17:09,029 --> 00:17:11,465
Thailand stands still, right?

91
00:17:13,033 --> 00:17:15,035
So we've got to
think of the future.

92
00:17:16,004 --> 00:17:20,775
The governor, he'd
like to retire.

93
00:17:21,876 --> 00:17:25,647
The company, it has
been liquidated.

94
00:17:26,881 --> 00:17:29,383
So where does that
leave us, right?

95
00:17:30,652 --> 00:17:32,152
Uncertain times indeed.

96
00:17:38,526 --> 00:17:41,796
Now I don't know about
you, mate, but I got plans.

97
00:17:43,397 --> 00:17:46,133
20-five years of
doing this shite.

98
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:47,569
It's done my fucking head in.

99
00:17:49,336 --> 00:17:51,104
Now, I want to live
in a house on a beach.

100
00:17:56,644 --> 00:17:57,679
Somewhere in Asia.

101
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:00,480
I can fish off my boat.

102
00:18:02,082 --> 00:18:04,652
And not be looking
over my shoulder for
the rest of my life.

103
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:06,654
I think I deserve it.

104
00:18:07,722 --> 00:18:10,959
And the boss, he deserves it too

105
00:18:10,992 --> 00:18:13,260
because he's a diamond geezer.

106
00:18:16,564 --> 00:18:19,366
So if I hear that
you've interfered

107
00:18:19,399 --> 00:18:22,837
with the sale of his company-
- I didn't do it. I swear.

108
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:23,705
I swear.

109
00:18:26,173 --> 00:18:27,341
- The code, Howie.

110
00:18:28,241 --> 00:18:30,078
Where are they?

111
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:32,046
And where's Rousseau?

112
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,314
- I told you I don't
have the codes.

113
00:18:34,348 --> 00:18:36,383
I don't know. I don't know.

114
00:18:38,352 --> 00:18:40,354
- But you know where
Rousseau is, right?

115
00:18:41,856 --> 00:18:46,861
- No, I don't.

116
00:18:47,962 --> 00:18:51,766
- You know, problem
for you, Howie,

117
00:18:51,799 --> 00:18:53,568
is I'm starting to believe you.

118
00:18:54,902 --> 00:18:57,204
And that ain't
good for you, sir.

119
00:19:09,216 --> 00:19:10,417
- Okay, okay. Okay. Okay.

120
00:19:14,656 --> 00:19:16,189
- Wise decision.

121
00:20:03,705 --> 00:20:05,372
- Good morning, Gov.

122
00:20:07,207 --> 00:20:11,211
I just had a little chat
with Howard. He had MIT.

123
00:20:12,647 --> 00:20:16,617
- No. No, no, no, no.

124
00:20:16,651 --> 00:20:17,785
- Really?

125
00:20:17,819 --> 00:20:19,453
I'd long gone by now.

126
00:20:20,988 --> 00:20:21,889
How'd you find him?

127
00:20:24,859 --> 00:20:25,993
I don't need to know.

128
00:20:26,861 --> 00:20:28,395
What'd you find out?

129
00:20:29,496 --> 00:20:31,933
- He doesn't have
the decryption codes.

130
00:20:31,966 --> 00:20:34,135
He already sold them Rousseau.

131
00:20:34,168 --> 00:20:35,870
But now, they've
been re-encrypted.

132
00:20:37,038 --> 00:20:38,740
- Are you sure?
- Positive.

133
00:20:41,743 --> 00:20:43,410
- And?

134
00:20:43,443 --> 00:20:46,848
- The emails, the information,
it's already been leaked.

135
00:20:46,881 --> 00:20:48,482
It's all over the internet.

136
00:20:48,516 --> 00:20:50,818
Fortunately, no one will
be able to make sense

137
00:20:50,852 --> 00:20:52,019
of 'em until it's decrypted.

138
00:21:01,294 --> 00:21:03,698
- If that information is
made public, it's all over.

139
00:21:05,233 --> 00:21:07,034
A deal we're dealing
with will be the dead.

140
00:21:08,603 --> 00:21:13,508
And the other things, things
we've had to do to survive.

141
00:21:14,842 --> 00:21:15,777
It's all in there.

142
00:21:20,114 --> 00:21:21,883
A lifetime of work...

143
00:21:23,117 --> 00:21:24,719
Gone in an instant.

144
00:21:30,992 --> 00:21:33,426
- I think I know where he is.

145
00:21:35,229 --> 00:21:36,531
- Where?

146
00:21:36,564 --> 00:21:39,399
- Tijuana, Mexico.
By the border.

147
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:41,736
- What's he doing there?

148
00:21:42,937 --> 00:21:45,940
- I guess as he plans to
cross into the states,

149
00:21:45,973 --> 00:21:47,909
we've got to get to him first.

150
00:21:53,114 --> 00:21:55,049
- Do whatever it takes.

151
00:21:57,118 --> 00:21:59,754
- No worries.
Considered it sorted.

152
00:23:05,019 --> 00:23:07,288
- Sorry about your wife, John.

153
00:23:07,321 --> 00:23:08,155
- It's okay.

154
00:23:15,462 --> 00:23:17,131
- For ex-fil, just in case.

155
00:23:18,165 --> 00:23:20,500
- Thanks. I got it.
- Thanks.

156
00:23:31,379 --> 00:23:33,814
He'll get you where you're
going? No questions.

157
00:23:44,525 --> 00:23:46,394
It's all below deck.

158
00:23:46,426 --> 00:23:48,461
Long range, short range,
anti-surveillance,

159
00:23:48,495 --> 00:23:50,197
and one-time pad.

160
00:23:50,231 --> 00:23:51,498
And a cold one in the fridge.

161
00:23:55,102 --> 00:23:56,570
Take care of yourself, John.

162
00:25:30,798 --> 00:25:32,533
- Reminds me of Madrid.

163
00:25:35,669 --> 00:25:39,173
Nice tables. Pigeons.

164
00:25:39,206 --> 00:25:41,709
Coffee tastes like shit though.

165
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:44,979
- Are we good?
- Not really.

166
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,715
- What does that mean?

167
00:25:47,748 --> 00:25:50,618
- Means you made a mess
of things down in Bolivia.

168
00:25:50,651 --> 00:25:52,953
Three dead cops.

169
00:25:52,987 --> 00:25:54,789
Chief of Police,
for Christ's sake.

170
00:25:56,657 --> 00:26:00,728
- I had no choice.
They had to die.

171
00:26:01,862 --> 00:26:03,097
- Really?

172
00:26:03,130 --> 00:26:06,467
Well, I'm gonna have
to take an extra 10%

173
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:08,202
just to fix things.

174
00:26:14,675 --> 00:26:15,676
- Oh, gracia.

175
00:26:20,014 --> 00:26:21,715
- What's next?

176
00:26:22,850 --> 00:26:25,186
- You do understand that
you're a difficult asset

177
00:26:25,219 --> 00:26:27,188
to sell right now, huh?

178
00:26:27,221 --> 00:26:30,024
Subtlety is no longer
your strong suit.

179
00:26:30,057 --> 00:26:32,126
Wanna tell me what's
going on, John?

180
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:34,695
- I'm the best solo asset
you've got and you know it.

181
00:26:34,728 --> 00:26:37,532
- I can't book what
people don't want.

182
00:26:37,566 --> 00:26:39,667
Our clients pay...

183
00:26:42,436 --> 00:26:45,473
They pay for discretion, John.

184
00:26:45,507 --> 00:26:47,141
When they hire somebody
to clean up a mess

185
00:26:47,174 --> 00:26:50,010
or mitigate a risk, they
don't want some fucking cowboy

186
00:26:50,044 --> 00:26:51,846
to go in there and
turning simple John

187
00:26:51,879 --> 00:26:54,081
into a goddamn bloodbath.

188
00:26:54,115 --> 00:26:57,184
Gonna cut yourself
some slack, huh?

189
00:26:57,218 --> 00:26:59,086
You've been through a lot.

190
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,254
Take a break, maybe.

191
00:27:05,126 --> 00:27:06,894
There's not a lot
going on anyway.

192
00:27:09,263 --> 00:27:10,798
- There's always something

193
00:27:16,538 --> 00:27:17,371
What do you got?

194
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:22,910
- Got an open contract.
The border. Tijuana.

195
00:27:25,412 --> 00:27:28,617
- Open contracts
are for amateurs.

196
00:27:28,649 --> 00:27:31,819
Either they hire
me or they don't.

197
00:27:32,621 --> 00:27:33,988
- It's all I got, brother.

198
00:27:35,489 --> 00:27:36,323
It's your call.

199
00:27:37,458 --> 00:27:39,393
If you want the
gig, you can pick up

200
00:27:39,426 --> 00:27:41,262
the job description at HR.

201
00:27:42,763 --> 00:27:44,566

- Javier quit.

216
00:28:44,225 --> 00:28:45,660
- Too bad.

217
00:28:45,694 --> 00:28:48,963
Did he leave something for me?

218
00:28:48,996 --> 00:28:54,001
- Oye. Javier!

219
00:28:55,503 --> 00:28:57,938
Hey, Javier.

220
00:29:44,852 --> 00:29:46,721
- Your target
is a French National,

221
00:29:46,755 --> 00:29:48,222
Jean Rousseau.

222
00:29:48,255 --> 00:29:51,258
Former tech innovator
turned hacker and leaker.

223
00:29:51,292 --> 00:29:54,529
His actions are linked to the
fall of several multinational

224
00:29:54,562 --> 00:29:59,567
corporations, a drug cartel,
and an African dictator.

225
00:30:01,068 --> 00:30:03,103
Credible Intel shows that
he's preparing a data dump

226
00:30:03,137 --> 00:30:05,774
that will expose
fraud and corruption

227
00:30:05,806 --> 00:30:08,042
within a U.S. conglomerate.

228
00:30:08,075 --> 00:30:10,712
Rousseau was last seen with
his private security detail

229
00:30:10,745 --> 00:30:14,982
at the Grand Hotel
in downtown Tijuana.

230
00:30:15,015 --> 00:30:18,419
Auxiliary detachment zero
will steward covert access

231
00:30:18,452 --> 00:30:20,421
at nine hundred hours.

232
00:30:21,889 --> 00:30:25,660
Nearby Barrios may provide
cover to base operations

233
00:30:25,694 --> 00:30:28,797
and avoid in theater
operators hunting

234
00:30:28,829 --> 00:30:30,397
the seven-figure bounty.

235
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:36,504
Discretion and
expediency are paramount.

236
00:30:37,672 --> 00:30:40,908
Seek. Locate. Terminate
with prejudice.

237
00:31:48,743 --> 00:31:50,678
- It's 20 for me and
five for the room.

238
00:31:53,882 --> 00:31:55,416
- How much for the whole night?

239
00:31:57,418 --> 00:31:58,919
- A hundred dollars.

240
00:32:03,691 --> 00:32:05,693
80, it's okay for me.

241
00:32:07,227 --> 00:32:11,533
- I'll pay you 200 if
you stay in the room

242
00:32:11,566 --> 00:32:12,366
for the whole night.

243
00:32:14,769 --> 00:32:16,036
Half now...

244
00:32:20,708 --> 00:32:21,576
Half later?

245
00:32:26,848 --> 00:32:30,718
- Okay. But nothing rough.

246
00:32:30,752 --> 00:32:32,720
And cameras are extra.

247
00:32:34,789 --> 00:32:37,692
- Nothing at all.
Take the night off.

248
00:33:37,484 --> 00:33:40,622
- Where did you go?
Who did you talk to?

249
00:33:40,655 --> 00:33:42,590
- No one. I spoke to no one.

250
00:33:42,624 --> 00:33:44,124
I swear, please.

251
00:33:45,125 --> 00:33:46,761
I went to my sister's house.

252
00:33:46,794 --> 00:33:48,495
She--she lives upstairs.

253
00:33:49,363 --> 00:33:51,799
I thought you might be hungry.

254
00:34:30,672 --> 00:34:32,072
- Have you eaten?

255
00:34:40,715 --> 00:34:41,549
Thank you.

256
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:27,227
- Are you here to kill someone?

257
00:35:29,229 --> 00:35:31,799
Is that what the gun is for?

258
00:35:41,141 --> 00:35:42,142
- It's what I do.

259
00:35:44,646 --> 00:35:45,780
I'm good at it.

260
00:35:49,751 --> 00:35:51,786
It's all I'm good at.

261
00:35:57,992 --> 00:36:00,728
- What you do is
not who you are.

262
00:39:35,509 --> 00:39:37,678
- I'll take your bag, sir.

263
00:39:58,366 --> 00:40:00,201
This will be your room, sir.

264
00:40:00,234 --> 00:40:05,438
Here's your room key.

265
00:40:10,378 --> 00:40:12,013
- Where the hell is Miguel?

266
00:40:13,814 --> 00:40:16,951
- He couldn't make
it. Edgar sent me.

267
00:40:16,984 --> 00:40:20,021
- Code in. Code in!

268
00:40:20,054 --> 00:40:21,856
- Necktie.

269
00:40:21,889 --> 00:40:24,025
No, no, no. I'm
sorry, sorry, sorry.

270
00:40:24,058 --> 00:40:25,526
It's bow tie. Bow tie.

271
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,201
- I don't work with
people I don't know.

272
00:40:45,713 --> 00:40:47,882
- I'm all he could get
on such short notice.

273
00:40:50,751 --> 00:40:52,954
How long you're going to need?

274
00:40:52,987 --> 00:40:55,556
- Two days. Maybe three.

275
00:40:58,626 --> 00:41:00,628
You can keep the
staff out here, right?

276
00:41:03,397 --> 00:41:04,231
- Yeah, sure.

277
00:41:08,869 --> 00:41:11,906
- I'm going to need some
eyes and a little help

278
00:41:11,939 --> 00:41:13,507
from guest services,

279
00:41:15,443 --> 00:41:17,378
if you're up for it.

280
00:41:17,411 --> 00:41:20,247
- Yes, whatever you
need. I got you.

281
00:41:22,416 --> 00:41:26,220
- All right. Here's the
guy we have to find.

282
00:41:26,253 --> 00:41:28,055
Heavy French accent.

283
00:41:28,089 --> 00:41:31,192
Probably checked in
within the last few days.

284
00:42:04,959 --> 00:42:05,793
- Sykes.

285
00:42:07,428 --> 00:42:08,829
What are you doing?

286
00:42:17,338 --> 00:42:19,273
- Talk to me, Chico.

287
00:42:19,306 --> 00:42:21,575
- I found your
guy. I got his room number.

288
00:42:22,810 --> 00:42:25,012
It looks like he has
a security detail.

289
00:42:25,046 --> 00:42:28,282
- Yeah, I know her.
- Really? No shit.

290
00:42:28,315 --> 00:42:31,952
- It's Sykes. She's
usually working at an angle.

291
00:42:31,986 --> 00:42:35,289
- All right, so
how do you want to proceed?

292
00:42:35,322 --> 00:42:38,059
- We're going to need to
separate her from the target.

293
00:42:38,092 --> 00:42:39,894
Come on. Let's get ready.

294
00:42:52,507 --> 00:42:56,077
Okay, Chico, you ready for this?

295
00:42:56,110 --> 00:42:57,378
- In and out, right?

296
00:42:57,411 --> 00:43:00,014
- In and out. Don't linger.

297
00:43:01,148 --> 00:43:04,685
I know these operators.
They will make you.

298
00:43:06,521 --> 00:43:09,590
- Hey, did you ever
sleep with her?

299
00:43:10,224 --> 00:43:11,058
- Which one?

300
00:43:12,226 --> 00:43:13,194
- Either?

301
00:43:14,829 --> 00:43:16,730
- We're just colleagues.

302
00:43:17,431 --> 00:43:18,265
- Right.

303
00:43:21,268 --> 00:43:22,236
- Are you carrying?

304
00:43:33,247 --> 00:43:35,182
Leave this to me, okay?

305
00:43:35,216 --> 00:43:36,650
You're safer without it.

306
00:43:38,919 --> 00:43:40,154
Come on.

307
00:43:40,187 --> 00:43:43,023
Let's get going here.
We're burning daylight.

308
00:43:51,398 --> 00:43:53,767
Now remember, Chico, in and out.

309
00:43:55,636 --> 00:43:57,071
- In and out. Right.

310
00:44:24,765 --> 00:44:27,768
Room service.

311
00:44:32,507 --> 00:44:36,110
Room service?

312
00:44:38,112 --> 00:44:38,746
- Hold on.

313
00:44:40,681 --> 00:44:42,750
Over there. Spread arm. Up, up.

314
00:44:55,162 --> 00:44:56,730
You're good.

315
00:44:56,764 --> 00:44:57,765
- Thank you.

316
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:06,707
Good morning, sir.

317
00:45:07,775 --> 00:45:09,176
You have your breakfast here.

318
00:45:22,691 --> 00:45:24,158
Some orange juice.

319
00:45:33,535 --> 00:45:35,903
And some decoration
for the table.

320
00:45:45,179 --> 00:45:46,247
Wow, a dollar.

321
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:48,349
Thank you. You'll do now.

322
00:45:55,155 --> 00:45:57,391
- Will you been
needing anything else?

323
00:45:57,424 --> 00:46:01,696
- No, this is...it.

324
00:46:01,730 --> 00:46:02,863
This is fine.

325
00:46:08,002 --> 00:46:08,836
- Wow.

326
00:46:10,404 --> 00:46:12,873
You really do have a great
view from this suite.

327
00:46:13,874 --> 00:46:14,775
- In and out.

328
00:46:16,277 --> 00:46:18,279
- Yes, we do.

329
00:46:19,913 --> 00:46:21,315
- You know, there's a lot
of things you do in Tijuana.

330
00:46:21,348 --> 00:46:23,017
If you have the time.

331
00:46:23,050 --> 00:46:24,251
Will you be staying long?

332
00:46:25,620 --> 00:46:28,789
- No. Just for business.

333
00:46:28,822 --> 00:46:32,527
- Well that's a shame.
You can go shopping.

334
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:35,362
There's restaurants, music, art.

335
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:41,502
- Get out of there, Chico.

336
00:46:41,536 --> 00:46:43,103
- I'm very serious, sir.

337
00:46:43,137 --> 00:46:44,706
I mean we have great
clothing stores,

338
00:46:44,739 --> 00:46:46,440
great shoe stores,
great computer stores.

339
00:46:46,473 --> 00:46:48,208
We even have a great time--

340
00:46:48,242 --> 00:46:49,209
- Hm?

341
00:46:55,949 --> 00:46:57,451
- What the hell is this?

342
00:46:57,484 --> 00:46:58,919
- What did you say?

343
00:46:59,554 --> 00:47:00,888
- Get out of there.

344
00:47:00,921 --> 00:47:02,724
- I just said there's
great stores in Tijuana.

345
00:47:02,757 --> 00:47:07,895
- No, no, no. He
said computer stores.

346
00:47:08,228 --> 00:47:08,829
- Why?

347
00:47:11,599 --> 00:47:12,433
Why?

348
00:47:13,735 --> 00:47:15,235
- Look at me. Why?

349
00:47:29,784 --> 00:47:34,488
- Whoa!

350
00:47:44,498 --> 00:47:45,633
- Smith.

351
00:47:45,667 --> 00:47:46,500
- Yeah.

352
00:47:51,639 --> 00:47:53,040
- Go to the door!

353
00:48:12,993 --> 00:48:14,361
- Thanks, Chico.

354
00:48:21,235 --> 00:48:23,470
- Nice to see you again, John.

355
00:48:55,068 --> 00:48:57,739
- You look good, Sykes,
but you're slowing down.

356
00:49:15,255 --> 00:49:17,257
- Jesus Christ,
you know this guy?

357
00:49:17,291 --> 00:49:18,091
- Yes.

358
00:49:22,095 --> 00:49:25,032
- He's an ex-boyfriend?
- A colleague.

359
00:49:51,726 --> 00:49:53,093
- Come on, Sykes.

360
00:49:59,801 --> 00:50:00,602
- Here!

361
00:50:02,670 --> 00:50:05,272
Go!

362
00:50:33,701 --> 00:50:36,971
- Oh. Don't... don't touch me.

363
00:50:37,005 --> 00:50:38,907
Who the fuck are you?!

364
00:51:17,845 --> 00:51:20,582
- I need to have
a word with you.

365
00:51:29,023 --> 00:51:30,190
Where's Smith?

366
00:51:33,861 --> 00:51:34,696
Oy.

367
00:51:35,530 --> 00:51:36,363
Oy.

368
00:51:38,733 --> 00:51:40,100
Where's Smith?

369
00:51:41,234 --> 00:51:42,737
- I--I don't know.

370
00:51:45,573 --> 00:51:46,874
- Is that right?

371
00:51:49,209 --> 00:51:50,712
How'd you know him?

372
00:51:52,412 --> 00:51:54,782
- A guy paid me 3000
bucks to help him out.

373
00:51:57,852 --> 00:51:58,886
- Who was the guy?

374
00:52:00,387 --> 00:52:04,792
- Edgar...Edgar some--something.
I don't remember.

375
00:52:08,563 --> 00:52:09,396
- Edgar Mann.

376
00:52:18,740 --> 00:52:21,676
This yours?
- Yeah.

377
00:52:21,709 --> 00:52:22,710
- Unlock it.

378
00:52:28,116 --> 00:52:29,751
- So...so you know him, right?

379
00:52:31,586 --> 00:52:36,256
- Yeah. We've met. So
how did he contact you?

380
00:52:37,825 --> 00:52:38,926
- Baysanos Bar.

381
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:40,227
He has people that work there.

382
00:52:43,163 --> 00:52:44,732
So you guys are cool, right?

383
00:52:53,775 --> 00:52:55,275
Right, you guys are cool?

384
00:52:56,276 --> 00:52:57,277
You guys are friends?

385
00:52:58,813 --> 00:52:59,614
- Actually, no.

386
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:35,348
- Are you going to kill me?

387
00:53:55,737 --> 00:53:57,672
- I...I can pay you.

388
00:53:57,705 --> 00:53:59,239
I--I--I have money.

389
00:54:00,340 --> 00:54:01,909
Please, please, please.

390
00:54:03,711 --> 00:54:04,946
I beg. I beg.

391
00:54:04,979 --> 00:54:05,713
Please, please don't shoot
me. I can pay. Please.

392
00:54:10,585 --> 00:54:11,519
- Get down.

393
00:54:13,087 --> 00:54:14,856
- Please.
- Get down!

394
00:54:16,256 --> 00:54:21,028
- Please.

395
00:54:34,876 --> 00:54:36,376
- Are you married?

396
00:54:40,114 --> 00:54:41,549
Are you married?!

397
00:55:05,740 --> 00:55:06,574
- She's dead.

398
00:55:07,975 --> 00:55:12,980
And the lady, break failure.

399
00:55:14,949 --> 00:55:18,318
The car company said
it was 'driver error.'

400
00:55:22,223 --> 00:55:25,927
Bullshit. Manufacturing defect.

401
00:55:27,562 --> 00:55:29,564
I hacked into the
file to prove it.

402
00:55:32,099 --> 00:55:33,801
That is what they do, you see.

403
00:55:35,203 --> 00:55:36,571
They make as much
money as possible.

404
00:55:36,604 --> 00:55:38,471
And fuck you if
you're in the way.

405
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:41,943
There is no accountability.

406
00:55:44,444 --> 00:55:46,379
The government,
they are pussies.

407
00:55:48,783 --> 00:55:49,650
It is why I do.

408
00:55:51,252 --> 00:55:54,522
I fill the void when
they are murderers.

409
00:55:57,558 --> 00:55:58,926
I hold up the mirror.

410
00:56:05,465 --> 00:56:10,470
It was three
years ago when they died.

411
00:56:16,143 --> 00:56:17,812
Maybe... it is over.

412
00:56:25,987 --> 00:56:27,688
Maybe now it is finished.

413
00:56:37,497 --> 00:56:38,566
- Get in the car.

414
00:57:20,241 --> 00:57:22,710
- What's this all about anyways?

415
00:57:25,913 --> 00:57:26,547
- Silver.

416
00:57:27,715 --> 00:57:31,352
He behaves like a
king but he's a thug.

417
00:57:31,385 --> 00:57:34,822
He has built an empire
but with mob connections

418
00:57:34,855 --> 00:57:39,327
and insider trading,
anything crooked.

419
00:57:39,360 --> 00:57:43,097
But he's stupid and greedy.

420
00:57:44,765 --> 00:57:49,770
Now, all his holdings are
only worth something on paper.

421
00:57:52,273 --> 00:57:53,741
- Yeah.

422
00:57:53,774 --> 00:57:56,077
- And he plans on selling it
all to the highest bidder.

423
00:57:56,110 --> 00:57:56,978
- Exact demo.

424
00:57:58,980 --> 00:58:00,081
He did is toxic.

425
00:58:01,481 --> 00:58:05,419
So I use some leverage
on one of his guys inside

426
00:58:05,453 --> 00:58:08,789
using some of
Silver's own money.

427
00:58:08,823 --> 00:58:13,828
And I've got some data that
explains exactly how much

428
00:58:14,729 --> 00:58:16,731
in the red he actually is.

429
00:58:16,764 --> 00:58:19,467
I encrypted it and I
hid it on the internet.

430
00:58:19,499 --> 00:58:21,235
Now he wants his data back.

431
00:58:22,336 --> 00:58:24,638
- And you can decrypt this data?

432
00:58:24,672 --> 00:58:27,808
- Oh, yeah. Not a problem.

433
00:58:27,842 --> 00:58:29,176
- How?

434
00:58:29,210 --> 00:58:31,812
- Using codes in my head.

435
00:58:38,085 --> 00:58:40,654
- So how much
are you paying Sykes?

436
00:58:41,856 --> 00:58:42,690
- 100 grand.

437
00:58:44,291 --> 00:58:47,795
- You've got a million-dollar
purse on your head.

438
00:58:47,828 --> 00:58:49,096
How long do you
think she was going

439
00:58:49,130 --> 00:58:50,631
to pretend to protect you?

440
00:58:58,706 --> 00:59:00,808
- Okay. What is your plan?

441
00:59:02,543 --> 00:59:04,678
- Get to the border.

442
00:59:04,712 --> 00:59:07,214
I'll get you to the U.S.
Marshals in San Diego.

443
00:59:08,149 --> 00:59:09,316
They can protect you.

444
00:59:10,718 --> 00:59:11,952
- Thank you for not shooting me

445
00:59:11,986 --> 00:59:14,688
but I don't want
to be prosecuted.

446
00:59:14,722 --> 00:59:17,825
- You got a much better chance
of making your case in court

447
00:59:17,858 --> 00:59:20,127
than you do out here.

448
00:59:20,161 --> 00:59:23,597
Do you have any idea how
many hitmen are after you?

449
00:59:23,631 --> 00:59:26,600
- He has a meathead
to kills for him.

450
00:59:26,634 --> 00:59:30,638
- Yeah, like gloves.
Funny accent.

451
00:59:30,671 --> 00:59:34,341
- So Henrik Botha from
London. You know him?

452
00:59:38,045 --> 00:59:38,879
- I used to.

453
00:59:40,515 --> 00:59:43,184
- Jesus Christ, you guys
you all know each other.

454
01:00:17,552 --> 01:00:21,055
- Oh, really? Where
am I going to go, huh?

455
01:00:23,390 --> 01:00:26,894
- Just look natural.
I'll be back.

456
01:00:26,927 --> 01:00:30,197
- Natural how? I'll have a soda.

457
01:00:31,999 --> 01:00:32,633
Agh.

458
01:00:52,153 --> 01:00:53,622
- How much?

459
01:00:55,289 --> 01:00:57,559
- It's two. Two dollars.

460
01:01:25,219 --> 01:01:26,820
- Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

461
01:01:59,320 --> 01:02:00,154
- Aaahhh!

462
01:02:21,075 --> 01:02:25,513
- Ah! Jesus Christ! You
could have killed me!

463
01:02:25,547 --> 01:02:26,981
- Get in the car.

464
01:04:28,035 --> 01:04:30,871
- Does this car have a GPS?

465
01:04:30,904 --> 01:04:32,272
- What?

466
01:04:32,306 --> 01:04:34,875
- Did Sykes put a GPS
tracker in the car?

467
01:04:36,009 --> 01:04:37,911
- I don't know. It is possible.

468
01:04:37,945 --> 01:04:39,346
- Son of a bitch.

469
01:04:47,321 --> 01:04:47,888
Stay low.

470
01:05:32,834 --> 01:05:34,234
Okay. Time to go.

471
01:05:36,503 --> 01:05:37,337
- What?

472
01:05:38,740 --> 01:05:39,574
- Come on.

473
01:07:46,834 --> 01:07:48,468
- Who the hell is John Smith?

474
01:07:51,873 --> 01:07:54,207
- He's just another
shooter for hire.

475
01:07:55,710 --> 01:07:57,210
- You know him?

476
01:07:58,046 --> 01:07:59,313
- Once upon a time, yeah.

477
01:08:04,552 --> 01:08:09,524
- Maybe this
wasn't such a good idea.

478
01:08:12,627 --> 01:08:17,599
There's too many operators.
Too many variables.

479
01:08:19,901 --> 01:08:21,168
- I'm on top of it, governor.

480
01:08:22,369 --> 01:08:25,238
- Has the security
detail contacted us yet?

481
01:08:27,107 --> 01:08:28,643
- She will.

482
01:08:28,676 --> 01:08:30,778
She wants to get paid, so
she'll make the exchange.

483
01:08:31,913 --> 01:08:35,717
- Fine. Set it
up. Get the codes.

484
01:09:19,761 --> 01:09:21,261
- It's so fragile.

485
01:09:25,633 --> 01:09:27,300
All of this money...

486
01:09:30,672 --> 01:09:31,506
Life...

487
01:09:35,643 --> 01:09:36,778
So very fragile.

488
01:09:48,690 --> 01:09:51,425
If you get me out of this, I'll
make you a rich man, Henrik.

489
01:09:51,458 --> 01:09:52,860
Richer than you ever dreamed.

490
01:09:59,967 --> 01:10:00,802
Kill everyone.

491
01:10:03,604 --> 01:10:06,541
I need this to go away.
All of it. Please.

492
01:10:07,909 --> 01:10:09,342
- I'll take care
all of it, boss.

493
01:10:12,180 --> 01:10:13,313
You get some sleep.

494
01:11:48,576 --> 01:11:49,409
- Hola?

495
01:11:50,978 --> 01:11:52,547
- I lost him.

496
01:11:52,580 --> 01:11:55,082
- Lost him? I thought
you were gonna kill him.

497
01:11:55,116 --> 01:11:56,383
- Yeah.

498
01:11:56,416 --> 01:11:59,452
About that, we're taking
the Marshall's bounty.

499
01:12:00,655 --> 01:12:02,757
- That's a
fraction as much?!

500
01:12:02,790 --> 01:12:03,490
- We're taking it.

501
01:12:04,491 --> 01:12:06,227
- I told you to 'be subtle.'

502
01:12:06,260 --> 01:12:08,062
Not 'go soft.'

503
01:12:08,095 --> 01:12:09,396
But look, I'm glad you called.

504
01:12:10,598 --> 01:12:12,432
There's been a wrinkle.

505
01:12:13,634 --> 01:12:15,536
It seems that Rousseau has
held on to some of the codes

506
01:12:15,570 --> 01:12:18,272
to decrypt the data that
he stole from Silver.

507
01:12:18,306 --> 01:12:19,907
And now Silver wants it back.

508
01:12:20,775 --> 01:12:22,910
- So I've heard.

509
01:12:22,944 --> 01:12:26,413
Sykes must be holding
Rousseau for a ransom.

510
01:12:26,446 --> 01:12:28,415
That's why she didn't just
put a bullet in his head

511
01:12:28,448 --> 01:12:30,117
when she had the chance.
- Yeah.

512
01:12:30,151 --> 01:12:33,420
And I don't think he's
gonna be willing to pay her.

513
01:12:33,453 --> 01:12:35,690
- He may think we have
the codes at this point.

514
01:12:36,824 --> 01:12:38,092
Are you safe?

515
01:12:38,125 --> 01:12:38,960
- Am I safe?

516
01:12:38,993 --> 01:12:41,796
I'm an enigma.

517
01:12:41,829 --> 01:12:43,297
I'm a mystery.

518
01:12:43,331 --> 01:12:45,266
I'm the fucking needle
in the haystack, baby.

519
01:12:45,299 --> 01:12:46,834
Nobody can find me.

520
01:12:46,868 --> 01:12:49,502
- Yeah. Yeah.
How do I find Rousseau?

521
01:12:49,537 --> 01:12:52,273
- I don't think that's
gonna be too hard.

522
01:12:52,306 --> 01:12:54,407
I've been looking
at his website.

523
01:12:54,441 --> 01:12:57,945
I think he took him to the
De La Rosa development.

524
01:12:57,979 --> 01:12:59,113
It's private.

525
01:12:59,146 --> 01:12:59,947
It's one of those developments.

526
01:12:59,981 --> 01:13:00,948
It isn't finished.

527
01:13:00,982 --> 01:13:02,116
Never gonna be finished.

528
01:13:02,149 --> 01:13:03,784
But he's got a
million-dollar view.

529
01:13:03,818 --> 01:13:07,555
It's a great place to hide
out and issue ransom demands.

530
01:13:07,588 --> 01:13:10,024
I think he posted something
with his smartphone trying

531
01:13:10,057 --> 01:13:11,491
to send us a message.

532
01:13:11,525 --> 01:13:14,095
But look, there's something
more you should know.

533
01:13:14,128 --> 01:13:15,529
Where are you right now?

534
01:13:17,298 --> 01:13:21,002
- At the Dead Drop.

535
01:13:22,536 --> 01:13:25,373
- All right, John, listen to me.

536
01:13:25,405 --> 01:13:26,841
Listen to me very carefully.

537
01:13:26,874 --> 01:13:30,044
I want you to get up and I want
you to get out of that bar.

538
01:13:30,077 --> 01:13:31,545
Do you understand me?

539
01:13:31,579 --> 01:13:34,382
Silver has widened the
contract to anybody associated

540
01:13:34,414 --> 01:13:35,549
with this job.

541
01:13:35,583 --> 01:13:37,551
He's burning the whole project.

542
01:13:37,585 --> 01:13:39,520
He's gonna fill your
lap with locals.

543
01:13:39,553 --> 01:13:42,556
He's sending in an enforcer
after Sykes and Rousseau.

544
01:13:47,194 --> 01:13:48,461
Smith? Smith?!

545
01:13:51,332 --> 01:13:52,099
- I gotta go.

546
01:14:15,556 --> 01:14:17,725
- You ain't going nowhere.

547
01:15:10,544 --> 01:15:11,579
- Fuck!

548
01:16:15,242 --> 01:16:18,513
Esperanza.

549
01:17:35,189 --> 01:17:36,757
- What happened?

550
01:17:36,790 --> 01:17:38,759
- I had a disagreement.

551
01:17:44,398 --> 01:17:45,900
- Let me help you.

552
01:17:53,440 --> 01:17:55,644
I'm sorry.

553
01:17:55,676 --> 01:17:57,912
This has to come out.

554
01:17:57,945 --> 01:17:59,880
I'll get some things.

555
01:17:59,914 --> 01:18:01,550
I'll be right back.

556
01:19:16,090 --> 01:19:20,861
One left. Are you ready?

557
01:19:21,862 --> 01:19:24,231
- Don't tell me. Just do it.

558
01:19:42,449 --> 01:19:43,951
- You're gonna be okay.

559
01:19:45,720 --> 01:19:49,056
- Yeah. I think I'm
going to be fine.

560
01:19:52,059 --> 01:19:52,893
Ugh.

561
01:19:58,566 --> 01:19:59,933
Sorry about your sheets.

562
01:20:01,569 --> 01:20:02,903
- They've seen worse.

563
01:20:20,421 --> 01:20:21,422
I was married once too.

564
01:20:30,831 --> 01:20:31,899
- What happened?

565
01:20:34,769 --> 01:20:35,969
- You know what they say.

566
01:20:37,639 --> 01:20:39,173
Don't go into
business with family.

567
01:20:40,642 --> 01:20:44,445
Maybe not so good idea to fall
in love and marry your pimp.

568
01:20:45,946 --> 01:20:47,981
It didn't last, anyway.

569
01:20:53,788 --> 01:20:56,023
What happened to your wife?

570
01:20:59,493 --> 01:21:00,994
- Not much to tell.

571
01:21:09,002 --> 01:21:11,004
She's in a better place.

572
01:21:15,342 --> 01:21:16,143
- I'm sorry.

573
01:23:28,810 --> 01:23:31,411
- Is
everything okay?

574
01:23:31,445 --> 01:23:32,279
- I gotta go.

575
01:23:35,349 --> 01:23:36,283
- Right now?

576
01:23:38,385 --> 01:23:39,019
- Yeah.

577
01:23:40,722 --> 01:23:43,123
- Okay, I'll make some coffee.

578
01:24:15,657 --> 01:24:16,791
- What's wrong?

579
01:24:16,824 --> 01:24:18,660
- We gotta go.

580
01:24:18,693 --> 01:24:20,060
- What?
- Now!

581
01:25:04,237 --> 01:25:07,374
Ahh!

582
01:25:07,407 --> 01:25:11,746
Go! Go!

583
01:26:24,484 --> 01:26:25,485
- Yeah?

584
01:26:25,520 --> 01:26:28,589
- An open contract? Are
you fucking kidding me?

585
01:26:28,623 --> 01:26:31,759
- What can I say?
The economy is slow.

586
01:26:31,793 --> 01:26:34,862
- You bring me Rousseau,
I'll let you live.

587
01:26:36,164 --> 01:26:39,600
- Mm, I can't do that.
- Sure you can.

588
01:26:39,634 --> 01:26:42,136
You stick him in a
booty of your motor

589
01:26:42,170 --> 01:26:44,839
and you bring him to
me now. Easy peasy.

590
01:26:46,373 --> 01:26:48,241
- I got my bounty.

591
01:26:48,275 --> 01:26:50,144
- What? The Marshall's?

592
01:26:50,178 --> 01:26:52,479
Yeah, I mean
a lot of fun. Yeah?

593
01:26:53,981 --> 01:26:56,818
Look, because you went
soft doesn't mean you have

594
01:26:56,851 --> 01:26:58,285
to go stupid.

595
01:26:58,318 --> 01:27:00,121
What the fuck happened to you?

596
01:27:00,154 --> 01:27:01,622
I knew you when you were young.

597
01:27:01,656 --> 01:27:05,492
In your prime, I treated
you like a little brother.

598
01:27:07,929 --> 01:27:08,996
- See you around, Henrik.

599
01:27:12,232 --> 01:27:13,835
Do you like the coast?
- Yeah.

600
01:28:00,014 --> 01:28:00,882
- They're in there?

601
01:28:01,849 --> 01:28:02,683
- Yeah.

602
01:28:08,055 --> 01:28:10,258
Esperanza, listen.

603
01:28:10,290 --> 01:28:12,193
I want you to take the car.

604
01:28:12,226 --> 01:28:15,196
Get out of here. Keep driving.

605
01:28:15,229 --> 01:28:17,297
Just head south until
all this blows over.

606
01:28:19,967 --> 01:28:21,301
- I don't want to leave.

607
01:28:23,638 --> 01:28:24,471
Please.

608
01:28:25,907 --> 01:28:29,610
Let me stay.

609
01:28:29,644 --> 01:28:33,614
- Look, I'm not likely
to make this happen.

610
01:28:34,749 --> 01:28:37,752
And even if I do, I'm
gonna have to run.

611
01:28:38,920 --> 01:28:40,387
You're safer gone.

612
01:29:02,009 --> 01:29:06,814
Take care of yourself.

613
01:29:37,879 --> 01:29:39,614
- You know, he's not
going to pay you.

614
01:29:39,647 --> 01:29:41,849
He does not have any money.

615
01:29:43,184 --> 01:29:45,519
He is going to have you killed.

616
01:29:48,455 --> 01:29:49,489
I can pay you.

617
01:29:50,358 --> 01:29:51,692
I have money.

618
01:29:55,663 --> 01:29:57,430
You take me to the U.S. Marshal.

619
01:30:00,334 --> 01:30:01,501
Oh, come on.

620
01:30:01,535 --> 01:30:03,871
How many people do you
think are going to come?

621
01:30:03,905 --> 01:30:04,805
Come to kill you.

622
01:30:06,073 --> 01:30:10,278
Not just professionals
like Smith and Botha,

623
01:30:10,311 --> 01:30:12,880
but local contractors.

624
01:30:12,914 --> 01:30:14,815
20, maybe 30.

625
01:30:16,217 --> 01:30:18,653
How many people do you think
you can take on your own?

626
01:30:18,686 --> 01:30:23,024
Six? Eight? A dozen,
you crazy lesbian.

627
01:30:23,057 --> 01:30:24,058
- Would you shut up?!

628
01:30:28,562 --> 01:30:31,632
- Get up! Take the stairs.

629
01:30:31,666 --> 01:30:34,201
- Sykes, Silver's burned us.

630
01:30:35,536 --> 01:30:37,872
We gotta get out of here.

631
01:30:37,905 --> 01:30:38,539
- This way.

632
01:30:44,378 --> 01:30:45,212
- Sykes!

633
01:30:47,581 --> 01:30:50,885
Get in.

634
01:30:53,220 --> 01:30:55,690
- Sykes, it's time to ex-fil.

635
01:31:00,127 --> 01:31:02,029
- Not until I get my money.

636
01:31:09,403 --> 01:31:10,905
- He's never going to pay you.

637
01:31:18,379 --> 01:31:20,514
- He will if he
wants his data back!

638
01:31:24,752 --> 01:31:29,256
- I'll get him out of here
and you can just disappear.

639
01:32:04,625 --> 01:32:06,093
- You've lost it.

640
01:32:07,128 --> 01:32:08,129
You're soft.

641
01:32:14,435 --> 01:32:15,269
- Just go.

642
01:32:31,352 --> 01:32:32,553
- Lucky you.

643
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:47,802
- Botha.

644
01:32:47,835 --> 01:32:50,539
I know you're out there, Botha.

645
01:32:50,571 --> 01:32:52,606
And I'm ready for you.

646
01:32:54,575 --> 01:32:56,677
- Mr. Smith.

647
01:32:59,548 --> 01:33:01,582
Mr. Smith. Is that you?

648
01:33:49,263 --> 01:33:51,232
- Is that all you got, John?

649
01:33:52,800 --> 01:33:53,868
You're gonna have to do better
than that if you're gonna

650
01:33:53,901 --> 01:33:55,703
take up the king of this jungle.

651
01:34:00,575 --> 01:34:01,942
You're in the endgame, mate.

652
01:34:03,310 --> 01:34:05,446
I came here for him.

653
01:34:05,479 --> 01:34:09,650
But if you get in my way, I'm
gonna have you for lunch, son.

654
01:34:24,932 --> 01:34:26,400
You wanna fight or
you're gonna dance around

655
01:34:26,433 --> 01:34:28,736
like a fucking
ballerina all night?

656
01:34:39,280 --> 01:34:40,114
You fucked up, John.

657
01:34:41,315 --> 01:34:44,418
You sided with a mock
and you broke the code

658
01:34:46,020 --> 01:34:50,424
when you made that decision
to you would end up like this.

659
01:34:51,926 --> 01:34:56,463
You and me, you're either very
brave or very fucking stupid.

660
01:35:06,106 --> 01:35:09,777
I'm gonna make this
quick for old time sake.

661
01:35:17,151 --> 01:35:20,020
I guess it's a good
thing for you it's me

662
01:35:20,054 --> 01:35:21,956
rather than some
cheaper stranger.

663
01:35:29,531 --> 01:35:31,165
- Don't you ever
get tired of it?

664
01:35:35,502 --> 01:35:40,508
- Botha!

665
01:35:49,183 --> 01:35:50,017
- Now we're even.

666
01:35:53,020 --> 01:35:54,021
See you around, John.

667
01:35:58,259 --> 01:36:00,361
- See you around, Sykes.

668
01:36:44,471 --> 01:36:45,306
- You came back.

669
01:36:46,407 --> 01:36:47,241
- I never left.

670
01:36:55,316 --> 01:36:58,852
- Rousseau, Esperanza.

671
01:36:59,754 --> 01:37:00,555
- Hey.

672
01:37:26,480 --> 01:37:28,248
- What do you think will happen?

673
01:37:29,183 --> 01:37:31,251
- They'll take you into custody.

674
01:37:31,285 --> 01:37:33,588
Probably book you, hold
you till the morning,

675
01:37:33,621 --> 01:37:35,456
and the Marshals
will take you away.

676
01:37:42,996 --> 01:37:47,201
Hey, it's your chance
to make your case.

677
01:37:48,402 --> 01:37:49,470
It's your day in court.

678
01:37:50,638 --> 01:37:51,472
- Idiot.

679
01:37:53,641 --> 01:37:55,309
Well, you are right.

680
01:37:56,210 --> 01:37:59,046
And, uh, what will you do?

681
01:38:04,251 --> 01:38:05,152
- Head South?

682
01:38:06,186 --> 01:38:07,622
- Yes.

683
01:38:07,655 --> 01:38:08,989
- Disappear for a while.

684
01:38:10,825 --> 01:38:11,659
Start over.

685
01:38:14,228 --> 01:38:17,398
- Well, um...

686
01:38:21,268 --> 01:38:21,902
- Good luck.

687
01:38:24,539 --> 01:38:26,039
- Mademoiselle.

688
01:38:26,073 --> 01:38:27,709
- Take care of yourself.

689
01:38:47,361 --> 01:38:52,567
