So we just thought
it'd be nice to take, like,

247
00:10:29,764 --> 00:10:32,748
a trip to Santa Fe just to like
mix things up a little bit.

248
00:10:32,848 --> 00:10:36,912
- And avoid thinking
about Dad at all?

249

cross my mind.

gonna be a tough holiday

I think I'm gonna pass.

- Because I have my own family

so they're out of luck.

I am with you.

'cause of the beard?

definitely does help.

00:31:36,846 --> 00:31:40,310
it's all really nice, Max.
Truly.

686
00:31:40,410 --> 00:31:43,072
It's just...
- What?

687
00:31:43,172 --> 00:31:44,354
- I don't wanna not think
about my dad

688
00:31:44,454 --> 00:31:45,795
and be apart from my family
for the holidays.

689
00:31:45,895 --> 00:31:46,996
It's not the Clarkes.
It doesn't feel right.

690
00:31:47,096 --> 00:31:48,358
I want us all to be together

691
00:31:48,458 --> 00:31:50,240
and have the most
Mitch Christmas ever!

692
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:51,961
- Okay.
Then that's what we'll do.

693
00:31:52,061 --> 00:31:54,884
We will totally go for it.

694
00:31:54,984 --> 00:31:57,687
Honestly, I was worried
about driving an RV anyway.

695
00:31:57,787 --> 00:31:59,129

698
00:32:11,601 --> 00:32:12,422
- I don't know
about you guys,

699
00:32:12,522 --> 00:32:14,024
but as hard as I try,

700
00:32:14,124 --> 00:32:16,786
{\an1}most of my memories of Dad
are from when he was sick.

701
00:32:16,886 --> 00:32:20,670
And I think...I think
it's super important

702
00:32:20,770 --> 00:32:23,513
that we remember the good times

703
00:32:23,613 --> 00:32:28,478
and all of the amazing things
Dad did for our family,

704
00:32:28,578 --> 00:32:33,684
which is why I think we
should have Christmas together.

705
00:32:33,784 --> 00:32:35,085
So what do you guys think?

706
00:32:35,185 --> 00:32:36,206
- What's he doing
with the train?

707
00:32:36,306 --> 00:32:37,648
Is he facing it?
- Yeah.

708
00:32:37,748 --> 00:32:38,929
- Is he facing the camera?
- Yeah, he is.

709
00:32:39,029 --> 00:32:40,651
- Vajna, why don't you
take five?

710
00:32:40,751 --> 00:32:42,072
I just think Miles clearly
is not bringing it right now,

711
00:32:42,152 --> 00:32:44,134
so, you know.
Here.

712
00:32:44,234 --> 00:32:45,576
Just work your magic.

713
00:32:45,676 --> 00:32:46,857
- You guys are really
going all out

714
00:32:46,957 --> 00:32:48,258
for this Christmas card, huh?

715
00:32:48,358 --> 00:32:50,380
- Christmas newsletter.
It's a newsletter, Zoey.

716
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,503
- Yeah, and by the time
Adam Gluck gets it,

717
00:32:52,603 --> 00:32:55,666
it's gonna look like
we were skiing in St. Moritz.

718
00:32:55,766 --> 00:32:56,987
- We're gonna blow
his Glucking mind.

719
00:32:57,087 --> 00:32:58,669
- Okay.

720
00:32:58,769 --> 00:33:01,872
So I know you already
have plans with your sister.

721
00:33:01,972 --> 00:33:04,355
But is there any chance
you'd change them, please?

722
00:33:04,455 --> 00:33:05,476
Please, please, please, please?

723
00:33:05,576 --> 00:33:07,277
- Okay, I'll admit it.

724
00:33:07,377 --> 00:33:10,321
We've kinda been dreading going
ever since Jenna informed us

725
00:33:10,421 --> 00:33:12,323
we'd be staying in a yurt
and eating tofurkey.

726
00:33:12,423 --> 00:33:14,164
- Yeah, that sounds bad.

727
00:33:14,264 --> 00:33:15,466
- And was she joking
when she said she needed us

728
00:33:15,546 --> 00:33:17,248
to denounce Christmas

729
00:33:17,348 --> 00:33:19,490
as just "another example
of the mass Capitalist agenda"?

730
00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:20,971
I couldn't tell.
Honestly, I couldn't tell.

731
00:33:21,071 --> 00:33:22,253
- Me either.
- Yeah.

732
00:33:22,353 --> 00:33:24,335
Oh, Zoey.
I mean...

733
00:33:24,435 --> 00:33:25,856
[sighs]

734
00:33:25,956 --> 00:33:28,299
Look, it would be really nice
to spend Christmas

735
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:29,860
with my family
and, you know,

736
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:31,902
we could just really focus
on all the good times.

737
00:33:32,002 --> 00:33:35,266
- I promise you both,
I will make it super special.

738
00:33:35,366 --> 00:33:37,368
Just like how Dad
used to do it.

739
00:33:39,090 --> 00:33:41,072
- All right, yeah.
- Let's do it.

740
00:33:41,172 --> 00:33:42,994
Beep, beep.
[whooshing]

741
00:33:43,094 --> 00:33:44,595
- Wow.
- Okay.

742
00:33:44,695 --> 00:33:47,999
We'll cancel on Jenna
if you agree to throw fake snow

743
00:33:48,099 --> 00:33:49,921
at us
as we shred a black diamond.

744
00:33:50,021 --> 00:33:52,003
- Deal!
- Vajna, we're back!

745
00:33:52,103 --> 00:33:53,805
- We're back.
- Great, okay.

746
00:33:53,905 --> 00:33:55,366
So now all I have to do
is convince Mom,

747
00:33:55,466 --> 00:33:56,647
and that shouldn't
be too hard, right?

748
00:33:56,747 --> 00:33:58,730
- It might be.
- Why?

749
00:33:58,830 --> 00:34:00,571
- Oh, well, she and Deb
are really excited

750
00:34:00,671 --> 00:34:02,613
about their trip to Hawaii,
so...

751
00:34:02,713 --> 00:34:04,936
There he is.
Oh, yeah.

752
00:34:05,036 --> 00:34:07,058

of going zip-lining.

763
00:34:49,961 --> 00:34:51,463
- If we're not still hung over

764
00:34:51,563 --> 00:34:54,146
from our booze cruise
the night before.

765
00:34:54,246 --> 00:34:56,268
- And the odds of that are?
- Mm, no comment.

766
00:34:56,368 --> 00:34:57,909
- [chuckles]

767
00:34:58,009 --> 00:35:02,194
- So, clearly, you two
are excited about this trip,

768
00:35:02,294 --> 00:35:03,955
and I'm just wondering

769
00:35:04,055 --> 00:35:06,978
if you would consider
the possibility of...

770
00:35:09,421 --> 00:35:10,923
Postponing it?

771
00:35:11,023 --> 00:35:12,885
- Not on your life.
- Why would we do that?

772
00:35:12,985 --> 00:35:15,487
- Listen, Mom,
I think that it's great

773
00:35:15,587 --> 00:35:17,569
that you are gonna
take this vacation to...

774
00:35:17,669 --> 00:35:20,452
- Jingle and mingle.

775
00:35:20,552 --> 00:35:25,978
- And find yourself again,
which I totally support.

776
00:35:26,078 --> 00:35:27,820
But I'm just wondering
if you could maybe

777
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:31,303
find yourself...another time.

778
00:35:31,403 --> 00:35:33,746
Like maybe December 26th
or even later?

779
00:35:33,846 --> 00:35:35,748
- Why didn't you say something
before this?

780
00:35:35,848 --> 00:35:37,750
{\an3}- 'Cause I didn't realize how
much it meant to me until now,

781
00:35:37,850 --> 00:35:39,391
and how important
I think it would be

782
00:35:39,491 --> 00:35:40,913
for all of us to honor Dad

783
00:35:41,013 --> 00:35:44,396
and find our Christmas joy
together again.

784
00:35:44,496 --> 00:35:48,601
If you stay, I promise
I will handle everything.

785
00:35:48,701 --> 00:35:50,002
You won't even have
to lift a finger.

786
00:35:50,102 --> 00:35:51,444
- But what about Deb?

787
00:35:51,544 --> 00:35:53,325
I mean, I can't just
leave her stranded.

788
00:35:53,425 --> 00:35:55,488
- Yeah, your mother's
not the only widow here

789
00:35:55,588 --> 00:35:58,010
looking to escape
for the holidays.

790
00:35:58,110 --> 00:36:01,253
I spent last year
with my son's in-laws.

791
00:36:01,353 --> 00:36:03,696
Zoey, their cat
sat at the table.

792
00:36:03,796 --> 00:36:05,938
{\an1}- Well, then you can come to
our Christmas Eve dinner too.

793
00:36:06,038 --> 00:36:07,700
Mom, think about it.

794
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:11,384
Eggnog, a huge feast,
and then we can all watch

795
00:36:11,484 --> 00:36:13,706
one of Dad's favorite old
black-and-white movies

796
00:36:13,806 --> 00:36:14,987
together...that was always
my favorite part.

797
00:36:15,087 --> 00:36:17,770
It sounds pretty great.
I mean, doesn't it?

798
00:36:21,694 --> 00:36:23,276
- [sighs]
She really wants us to stay.

799
00:36:23,376 --> 00:36:27,040
- I know she does.
She played the dead Dad card.

800
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:30,563
- You know I can hear you,
right?

801
00:36:30,663 --> 00:36:32,365
- So do you think
the trip is refundable?

802
00:36:32,465 --> 00:36:34,487
- My travel agent
is a miracle worker

803
00:36:34,587 --> 00:36:36,809
so we could
probably get a credit.

804
00:36:36,909 --> 00:36:38,731
- And maybe postpone it
to a later date?

805
00:36:38,831 --> 00:36:39,852
- Spring break?

806
00:36:39,952 --> 00:36:42,936
- Oh!

807
00:36:43,036 --> 00:36:46,019
Oh, can't.
I have a huge install in March.

808
00:36:46,119 --> 00:36:48,061
Uh, what about February?

809
00:36:48,161 --> 00:36:51,344
- Hmm, pre- or
post-Valentine's day?

810
00:36:51,444 --> 00:36:55,468
both: During!
- Sold.

811
00:36:55,568 --> 00:36:57,871
{\an1}But I'm not happy about this,
and I want you to know that.

812
00:36:57,971 --> 00:37:01,534
So much for hot Christmas
with hot men.

813
00:37:05,058 --> 00:37:06,680
- She'll be fine.
- Thank you, Mom.

814
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:08,562
This is gonna be so great...

815
00:37:08,662 --> 00:37:10,443
if I can pull it all together
before Christmas.

816
00:37:10,543 --> 00:37:11,725
There are a million things
to do

817
00:37:11,825 --> 00:37:13,647

We are looking for a tree.

to the right place.

859

a little bit?

Maybe a red cedar or...
oh, I know.

They are so festive.

to the wind

Christmas experience

taking the night off or...

- The official
Christmas flower.

1190
00:53:09,834 --> 00:53:11,015
- [chuckles]

1191
00:53:11,115 --> 00:53:13,057
You can't get
anything past this one.

1192
00:53:13,157 --> 00:53:16,781
- Well, thank you.
This is lovely.

1193
00:53:16,881 --> 00:53:18,983
I know the perfect place
for it.

1194
00:53:19,083 --> 00:53:21,225
Zoey, would you
like to come with me?

1195
00:53:21,325 --> 00:53:24,949
- Sure would.
- Eggnog, Jack?

1196
00:53:25,049 --> 00:53:28,272
<i>[tense music]</i>

1197
00:53:28,372 --> 00:53:32,036
- Quick question.
Why did you invite

1198
00:53:32,136 --> 00:53:35,560
the Christmas tree log guy
to our Christmas Eve dinner?

1199
00:53:35,660 --> 00:53:37,882
- You thought I did this?
I thought you invited him.

1200
00:53:37,982 --> 00:53:40,645
- Why would I do that?
I don't even know that guy.

1201
00:53:40,745 --> 00:53:43,408
- Okay, well, if neither of us
invited him then...

1202
00:53:43,508 --> 00:53:46,551
- [humming]

1203
00:53:51,356 --> 00:53:54,198
- I think I know
what's going on.

1204
00:53:56,641 --> 00:53:58,543
You heard my mom sing
"Call Me Maybe"

1205
00:53:58,643 --> 00:53:59,784
at the Christmas tree lot,
didn't you?

1206
00:53:59,884 --> 00:54:01,226
- I sure did.

1207
00:54:01,326 --> 00:54:03,308
And I thought I'd perform
a little Chris-mitzvah

1208
00:54:03,408 --> 00:54:05,630
and invite Jack tonight because
her heart clearly wanted that.

1209
00:54:05,730 --> 00:54:07,072
- Max.
- What?

1210
00:54:07,172 --> 00:54:09,995
- I also heard my mom's
heart song that night,

1211
00:54:10,095 --> 00:54:13,999
which is why I talked to her
about it in great detail.

1212
00:54:14,099 --> 00:54:16,121
And I also made her look
at several online profiles

1213
00:54:16,221 --> 00:54:17,722
with me afterwards.

1214
00:54:17,822 --> 00:54:19,684
And let me tell you,
after that night, I am scarred.

1215
00:54:19,784 --> 00:54:21,446
And, more importantly,

1216
00:54:21,546 --> 00:54:25,130
she is nowhere near ready
to start dating yet.

1217
00:54:25,230 --> 00:54:26,571
- Are you sure?

1218
00:54:26,671 --> 00:54:28,173
'cause she really committed
to that song.

1219
00:54:28,273 --> 00:54:30,015
- You are way in over your head
on this, okay?

1220
00:54:30,115 --> 00:54:32,137
You do not understand
the complexities like I do.

1221
00:54:32,237 --> 00:54:34,539
- I'm sorry if you think
I overstepped my bounds.

1222
00:54:34,639 --> 00:54:36,381
I was really just trying
to make your mother feel good

1223
00:54:36,481 --> 00:54:39,064
on what I thought was gonna be
a hard night for her.

1224
00:54:39,164 --> 00:54:40,986
Please don't be mad
at me about that.

1225
00:54:41,086 --> 00:54:43,508
- I just wish you would have
told me before you did this.

1226
00:54:43,608 --> 00:54:45,831
- Yeah, you're right.
I-I should have done that.

1227
00:54:45,931 --> 00:54:48,554
I guess it seemed like
a fun surprise in my mind.

1228
00:54:48,654 --> 00:54:50,716
What do you want me to do?
Do you want me to kick him out?

1229
00:54:50,816 --> 00:54:51,837
Would that make you
feel better?

1230
00:54:51,937 --> 00:54:53,599
- No!
- Well, good,

1231
00:54:53,699 --> 00:54:55,521
'cause he's really big and I
don't know if I could take him.

1232
00:54:55,621 --> 00:54:57,963
- [sighs]

1233
00:54:58,063 --> 00:55:01,487
- Look, tonight
is gonna be great.

1234
00:55:01,587 --> 00:55:04,370
Look, seriously, you,
you worked hard on this.

1235
00:55:04,470 --> 00:55:06,171
Jack seems like
a really nice guy.

1236
00:55:06,271 --> 00:55:09,495
You are doing something kind
for someone else.

1237
00:55:09,595 --> 00:55:11,016
And who knows,

1238
00:55:11,116 --> 00:55:15,661
maybe the universe
wants him to be here,

1239
00:55:15,761 --> 00:55:17,543
okay?

1240
00:55:17,643 --> 00:55:22,468
- [sighs]

1241
00:55:22,568 --> 00:55:24,590
Okay.

1242
00:55:24,690 --> 00:55:26,752
[indistinct chatter]

1243
00:55:26,852 --> 00:55:28,754
- Zoey, you've gotta try

1244
00:55:28,854 --> 00:55:31,477
this new batch of eggnog
I whipped up.

1245
00:55:31,577 --> 00:55:33,579
- Okay.

1246
00:55:35,461 --> 00:55:36,762
[gulps]

1247
00:55:36,862 --> 00:55:39,085
That's, like, all alcohol.

1248
00:55:39,185 --> 00:55:41,487
Why did you change
my dad's recipe?

1249
00:55:41,587 --> 00:55:43,169
- No, no, no.
I didn't...I didn't change it.

1250
00:55:43,269 --> 00:55:44,850
I enhanced it.

1251
00:55:44,950 --> 00:55:47,613
I just wanted to get
everybody a little taste

1252
00:55:47,713 --> 00:55:51,177
of that sunset booze cruise
that we had booked for tonight.

1253
00:55:51,277 --> 00:55:52,939
- That reminds me.

1254
00:55:53,039 --> 00:55:57,063
Um, well, since we're here

1255
00:55:57,163 --> 00:56:00,006
and not in Hawaii...

1256
00:56:04,210 --> 00:56:06,993
Would you please be seated?
Ladies and gentleman,

1257
00:56:07,093 --> 00:56:10,356
the first thing on the agenda
for this evening

1258
00:56:10,456 --> 00:56:13,439
is for us each
to open one present,

1259
00:56:13,539 --> 00:56:17,443
which is a classic Clarke
"night before" tradition.

1260
00:56:17,543 --> 00:56:19,526
So here you go, Emily.

1261
00:56:19,626 --> 00:56:22,609
- Thank you, Zoey.
- One for David.

1262
00:56:22,709 --> 00:56:25,572
- Thank you so much.
- And little baby Miles.

1263
00:56:25,672 --> 00:56:27,253
both: Aww.

1264
00:56:27,353 --> 00:56:31,257
- And mom.
And for our guests, Deb...

1265
00:56:31,357 --> 00:56:33,500
- Oh, thank you.
- And Max.

1266
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:34,941
- Thank you.

1267
00:56:35,041 --> 00:56:37,183
- Oh, I didn't get anything
for you, Jack,

1268
00:56:37,283 --> 00:56:38,905
'cause I didn't know
you were coming.

1269
00:56:39,005 --> 00:56:41,107
- Oh, please.
Don't even worry about me.

1270
00:56:41,207 --> 00:56:44,030
I'm just sitting here
nursing this eggnog.

1271
00:56:44,130 --> 00:56:46,233
Put a little hair on my chest.
- Oh, yeah.

1272
00:56:46,333 --> 00:56:49,035
- Uh, you, you know what, Jack?
You can have mine.

1273
00:56:49,135 --> 00:56:50,397
- Oh, I couldn't, Max.
- No.

1274
00:56:50,497 --> 00:56:52,239
I've already had
eight nights out.

1275
00:56:52,339 --> 00:56:53,920
I'll be fine.

1276
00:56:54,020 --> 00:56:55,762
- Thank you, Max.
That's very sweet of you.

1277
00:56:55,862 --> 00:56:58,205
- Of course.
- [mouthing] What?

1278
00:56:58,305 --> 00:57:00,727
- Socks?
You gave us socks?

1279
00:57:00,827 --> 00:57:02,609
- Another Clarke
family tradition.

1280
00:57:02,709 --> 00:57:05,332
- Mom and Deb,
I got you hula girls

1281
00:57:05,432 --> 00:57:06,853
'cause I feel guilty.

1282
00:57:06,953 --> 00:57:09,816
And, David,
I got you a keyboard.

1283
00:57:09,916 --> 00:57:12,459
- Sometimes I like to go
to town on the 88s.

1284
00:57:12,559 --> 00:57:14,621
- For Emily, I got mini gavels.

1285
00:57:14,721 --> 00:57:16,463
And then, oh,
for little baby Miles,

1286
00:57:16,563 --> 00:57:18,305
I got a lot of my face

1287
00:57:18,405 --> 00:57:20,667
so that he can always look
at his auntie.

1288
00:57:20,767 --> 00:57:24,431
And then for Max, Legos.

1289
00:57:24,531 --> 00:57:28,716
Um, Max...I mean, Jack.

1290
00:57:28,816 --> 00:57:32,079
{\an1}- Yeah, I like to brag about
being a master brick builder.

1291
00:57:32,179 --> 00:57:34,561
- Well, also, the first day
that we met...

1292
00:57:34,661 --> 00:57:36,663
- Yeah, of course.

1293
00:57:39,907 --> 00:57:42,449
- Are you okay?

1294
00:57:42,549 --> 00:57:45,052
- Uh, um...
[clears throat]

1295
00:57:45,152 --> 00:57:47,535
I'm sorry, uh...
[sighs]

1296
00:57:47,635 --> 00:57:51,939
Well, uh, these just caught me
by surprise I guess.

1297
00:57:52,039 --> 00:57:55,583
- Oh, they're just socks.

1298
00:57:55,683 --> 00:57:57,545
- You know, I didn't...I
didn't have a lot growing up

1299
00:57:57,645 --> 00:58:01,028
and, uh...but
I did have this Lego set

1300
00:58:01,128 --> 00:58:04,271
that my father
gave me one Christmas,

1301
00:58:04,371 --> 00:58:07,515
and I played with it
all the time.

1302
00:58:07,615 --> 00:58:10,638
Anyway, these, uh...

1303
00:58:10,738 --> 00:58:12,320
these socks really, uh,

1304
00:58:12,420 --> 00:58:14,902
really brought me back
to a moment in time.

1305
00:58:16,784 --> 00:58:18,366
Oh, my God.
And now here

1306
00:58:18,466 --> 00:58:20,288
I am crying in front
of a bunch of strangers.

1307
00:58:20,388 --> 00:58:23,010
I'm sorry.

1308
00:58:23,110 --> 00:58:24,612
Thank you so much

1309
00:58:24,712 --> 00:58:28,136
for inviting me into your home
on Christmas Eve.

1310
00:58:28,236 --> 00:58:29,977
- We're happy to have you.
- You can come by anytime.

1311
00:58:30,077 --> 00:58:31,499
- Anytime, yeah.
- Yeah.

1312
00:58:31,599 --> 00:58:33,061
[bell rings]
- Well, uh,

1313
00:58:33,161 --> 00:58:36,945
that means it's almost dinner!
Whoo-Whoo!

1314
00:58:37,045 --> 00:58:41,429
Uh, David, Emily,
Max, baby Miles,

1315
00:58:41,529 --> 00:58:43,231
do you guys wanna help me
put everything on the table?

1316
00:58:43,331 --> 00:58:45,073

The ski trip, what happened?

1909

You should see the other guy!

It's the Clarkemans!

- Hey! Uh, how was birding
with the family?

1913

- Oh, incredible!

1914
01:30:44,634 --> 01:30:46,736
We got a photo of
the rare two-eared quetzal.

1915
01:30:46,836 --> 01:30:48,498
And I called my ex
at the Audobon Society and he...

1916

We're gonna grab a drink.

- Mezcal mule for me, bruh.
- Glass of wine.

1923

1925
01:31:05,175 --> 01:31:07,277
So, Christmas Eve with mom
and the new husband.

1926
01:31:07,377 --> 01:31:08,919
How was it?

1927
01:31:09,019 --> 01:31:10,760
- I'm not gonna lie.
It was a little weird at first

1928
01:31:10,860 --> 01:31:14,404
but...it was nice seeing
my mom so happy.

1929
01:31:14,504 --> 01:31:16,126
Which I guess is
all that matters, right?

1930
01:31:16,226 --> 01:31:17,968
Oh, before I forget...
- Yes.

1931
01:31:18,068 --> 01:31:19,930
- I brought you
both back souvenirs.

- Thank you.

- Max.
- Presents.

1934
01:31:23,113 --> 01:31:25,375
- Bro, I got you some "I heart
Las Vegas" golf balls

1935
01:31:25,475 --> 01:31:28,298
because I think it's time we
start playing a sport together

on the greens, pal!

- Okay.
And for you...

1940

Now, no matter what you're
feeling over the holidays,

1941

you can always look at this,
shake it up,
