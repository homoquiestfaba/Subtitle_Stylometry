2
00:02:48,736 --> 00:02:49,403
Sorry.

3
00:03:06,821 --> 00:03:08,623
- Shalom.
- Hi, how are you?

4
00:03:08,656 --> 00:03:09,924
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

5
00:03:09,957 --> 00:03:10,692
Please.

6
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:27,340
You think you can turn it
down a little bit?

7
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:28,609
Thank you. Thank you.

8
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,781
Here we go.

9
00:03:33,815 --> 00:03:34,782
Oh, we're here.

10
00:03:34,816 --> 00:03:36,349
- Yeah.
- Great.

11
00:03:38,052 --> 00:03:39,654
Thank you very much
and keep the change.

12
00:03:39,687 --> 00:03:41,421
- Oh wow, thank you.
- You're welcome.

13
00:03:52,767 --> 00:03:54,035
- There you go.
- Thank you.

14
00:03:54,068 --> 00:03:54,969
Enjoy.

15
00:04:56,063 --> 00:04:57,364
Oh, hello.

16
00:04:57,832 --> 00:05:00,701
I'm not sure I have the...
the right place.

17
00:05:00,735 --> 00:05:01,969
This is apartment 6, isn't it?

18
00:05:02,537 --> 00:05:03,604
Yeah...

19
00:05:03,838 --> 00:05:04,806
Oh.

20
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:06,507
I'm Michael.

21
00:05:07,374 --> 00:05:08,408
I'm...
I'm subletting the apartment.

22
00:05:09,744 --> 00:05:11,112
Yeah.
Yes, no, but that's tomorrow.

23
00:05:11,145 --> 00:05:12,412
You have the wrong day.

24
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:15,650
No, I don't, I don't think so.

25
00:05:17,118 --> 00:05:17,718
Here.

26
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:22,056
Okay, so here it says the 8th.

27
00:05:22,089 --> 00:05:23,090
Right.

28
00:05:24,025 --> 00:05:25,526
And that's tomorrow,
tomorrow is the 8th.

29
00:05:26,093 --> 00:05:28,095
No, tomorrow is the 9th.

30
00:05:28,129 --> 00:05:29,063
Today is the 8th.

31
00:05:30,164 --> 00:05:31,833
- Today is the 8th?
- Yeah.

32
00:05:32,099 --> 00:05:34,068
Fuck.
I was sure today's the 7th.

33
00:05:34,101 --> 00:05:36,704
Come. Come, please come in.

34
00:05:36,737 --> 00:05:37,939
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, yeah.

35
00:05:37,972 --> 00:05:39,472
I'm sorry about the mess.

36
00:05:39,907 --> 00:05:40,975
I'm really sorry about the mess,

37
00:05:42,109 --> 00:05:44,612
we were up all night shooting
something for my class

38
00:05:44,645 --> 00:05:45,680
and I didn't sleep for two days
now

39
00:05:45,713 --> 00:05:47,648
so I just forgot what day it is.

40
00:05:47,682 --> 00:05:49,050
I was sure today is the 7th.

41
00:05:50,417 --> 00:05:53,754
Just give me a few minutes and I
will organize everything, okay?

42
00:05:53,788 --> 00:05:56,691
I will make this place
look good as new.

43
00:06:23,985 --> 00:06:24,886
Excuse me.

44
00:06:24,919 --> 00:06:25,686
Yeah?

45
00:06:26,721 --> 00:06:27,555
Yeah, actually, I...
I think it might be better

46
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:29,523
if I just book myself into a
hotel.

47
00:06:30,457 --> 00:06:30,958
No! Please, please,
I'm almost finished.

48
00:06:31,893 --> 00:06:32,860
- Five minutes.
- No, no, thank you, but...

49
00:06:33,995 --> 00:06:35,029
I think I'd be better off
if I stayed at a hotel...

50
00:06:35,062 --> 00:06:38,132
Listen, I promise, I...

51
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:40,801
Sorry, I have to answer, it's
my mom

52
00:06:40,835 --> 00:06:43,436
and she won't stop calling me
if I don't answer, so...

53
00:06:55,616 --> 00:06:57,484
Come. I will show you the house.

54
00:06:57,518 --> 00:06:59,654
There are a lot of things.

55
00:07:01,923 --> 00:07:03,624
Do you really wanna go to a
hotel?

56
00:07:03,891 --> 00:07:06,627
Look around you, this is like
the coolest neighborhood ever.

57
00:07:06,661 --> 00:07:07,862
You know there was even a...

58
00:07:07,895 --> 00:07:09,864
an article in TimeOut London

59
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:11,699
about the sexiest neighborhoods
in the world

60
00:07:11,732 --> 00:07:12,733
and guess who won?

61
00:07:15,636 --> 00:07:16,771
Please stay.

62
00:07:17,772 --> 00:07:18,706
I'm sorry about my fuck-up,

63
00:07:19,707 --> 00:07:21,075
but I promise you,
this is a great apartment.

64
00:07:21,108 --> 00:07:22,475
And...

65
00:07:23,077 --> 00:07:25,445
I don't know
how else to say it, but...

66
00:07:26,781 --> 00:07:28,182
I really need the money.

67
00:09:13,954 --> 00:09:15,022
Shit.

68
00:11:22,216 --> 00:11:23,884
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

69
00:11:24,351 --> 00:11:25,920
Hang on just a second.

70
00:11:25,953 --> 00:11:27,354
I'm just trying to...

71
00:11:27,388 --> 00:11:29,290
Who are you murdering over
there?

72
00:11:29,323 --> 00:11:31,759
Just trying to open a bottle of
wine.

73
00:11:31,792 --> 00:11:32,860
With a knife?

74
00:11:32,893 --> 00:11:34,261
Couldn't find a corkscrew.

75
00:11:35,095 --> 00:11:36,230
There we go.

76
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,301
Tried you earlier,

77
00:11:40,801 --> 00:11:41,435
I was getting worried.

78
00:11:42,303 --> 00:11:44,471
Oh yeah, sorry, my...
my battery died.

79
00:11:45,005 --> 00:11:46,106
Okay.

80
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:48,175
So how, how was your flight?

81
00:11:48,909 --> 00:11:49,877
Did you get some sleep?

82
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:50,778
Not much.

83
00:11:51,378 --> 00:11:52,846
Why didn't you take a pill?

84
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,516
I did. Two of them.

85
00:11:54,549 --> 00:11:56,317
- Oh.
- I've gotta get Berger

86
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:58,319
to give me something stronger
when I get back.

87
00:11:58,886 --> 00:12:00,754
I... thought he did.

88
00:12:00,955 --> 00:12:01,789
I wish he had.

89
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:04,358
He said he'd think about raising
the dose when I get back.

90
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:06,026
Okay.

91
00:12:06,961 --> 00:12:08,963
So how's Tel Aviv?

92
00:12:08,996 --> 00:12:10,798
Ah, I haven't seen that much of
it.

93
00:12:10,831 --> 00:12:12,433
It's kind of a strange mixture.

94
00:12:12,933 --> 00:12:14,435
Not sure I can figure it out.

95
00:12:14,902 --> 00:12:18,138
You always say that,
and you always do by the fifth day.

96
00:12:18,172 --> 00:12:18,939
I guess.

97
00:12:19,306 --> 00:12:20,407
How's the apartment?

98
00:12:20,441 --> 00:12:21,775
The apartment...

99
00:12:22,577 --> 00:12:23,410
It's decent.

100
00:12:23,944 --> 00:12:24,546
Decent?

101
00:12:24,579 --> 00:12:26,013
It's okay, you know.

102
00:12:26,581 --> 00:12:28,449
Well, why...
why don't you show me around?

103
00:12:29,216 --> 00:12:30,884
Ah, let's see...

104
00:12:31,252 --> 00:12:32,353
Here we go.

105
00:12:34,121 --> 00:12:36,357
There's the bathroom,
you don't wanna go in there.

106
00:12:38,292 --> 00:12:39,893
There's my desk.

107
00:12:40,127 --> 00:12:43,364
Very low-hanging chandelier,

108
00:12:43,397 --> 00:12:44,932
something like that.

109
00:12:44,965 --> 00:12:47,801
And here is the living room,

110
00:12:47,835 --> 00:12:48,936
you know, it's pretty standard.

111
00:12:49,604 --> 00:12:52,373
Wait.
What's, what's that on the wall?

112
00:12:52,973 --> 00:12:55,075
That is "Nightmare on Elm
Street."

113
00:12:55,109 --> 00:12:56,810
Oh, part two!

114
00:12:57,011 --> 00:12:58,412
"Freddy's Revenge."

115
00:12:58,946 --> 00:13:01,282
Who hangs movie posters
in their living room?

116
00:13:01,315 --> 00:13:01,982
He's a kid.

117
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:04,385
I think he's a film student
or something.

118
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,222
Ah, a room with a view.

119
00:13:08,523 --> 00:13:10,224
Wouldn't go that far.

120
00:13:10,257 --> 00:13:11,559
Just the other buildings,

121
00:13:11,593 --> 00:13:14,194
here are the neighbors over
there.

122
00:13:18,499 --> 00:13:20,100
It's too dark to see anything

123
00:13:20,134 --> 00:13:22,269
but it's actually
a pretty cool location.

124
00:13:22,903 --> 00:13:24,171
It was just chosen by
TimeOut London

125
00:13:25,507 --> 00:13:26,373
as one of the sexiest new
neighborhoods in the world, so...

126
00:13:27,374 --> 00:13:30,377
Well, TimeOut London
makes mistakes too.

127
00:13:30,411 --> 00:13:31,979
You're such a snob.

128
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:35,382
Here we are back in the kitchen.

129
00:13:35,416 --> 00:13:36,850
Wait, wait...

130
00:13:36,884 --> 00:13:38,252
Go back to the fridge.

131
00:13:39,521 --> 00:13:40,954
Is that the kid?

132
00:13:40,988 --> 00:13:41,589
Zoom in.

133
00:13:41,623 --> 00:13:43,324
Yep, that's him.

134
00:13:43,357 --> 00:13:45,159
Oh my god, he's hot!

135
00:13:45,192 --> 00:13:47,361
Oh, stop.
You could be his dad.

136
00:13:47,394 --> 00:13:48,962
But I'm not.

137
00:13:49,963 --> 00:13:50,998
Is he gay?

138
00:13:51,265 --> 00:13:52,333
I don't know.

139
00:13:53,367 --> 00:13:55,369
Okay, I can see
you're not in the mood.

140
00:13:55,402 --> 00:13:57,204
I'm sorry, I'm just exhausted.

141
00:13:57,438 --> 00:13:59,541
Fine, I understand.

142
00:13:59,574 --> 00:14:00,941
- Go to bed.
- Okay.

143
00:14:00,974 --> 00:14:02,409
- Good night.
- Good night.

144
00:14:02,443 --> 00:14:03,511
And don't forget
to take your pills.

145
00:14:03,545 --> 00:14:05,580
I won't, I won't, don't worry.

146
00:14:06,213 --> 00:14:08,182
- I love you.
- Love you too.

147
00:15:16,283 --> 00:15:17,484
David Tartakover

148
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,054
is best known for his
politically provocative posters.

149
00:15:21,523 --> 00:15:24,224
His style features
minimalist compositions

150
00:15:24,258 --> 00:15:26,293
that use images
taken from the media,

151
00:15:26,326 --> 00:15:28,128
mixed with slogans and text,

152
00:15:28,162 --> 00:15:30,632
inspired by Russian
Constructivism.

153
00:15:31,265 --> 00:15:32,433
He has said:

154
00:15:32,466 --> 00:15:35,402
"My work is often
considered a protest.

155
00:15:35,637 --> 00:15:37,705
"It's not. It's a reaction.

156
00:15:37,739 --> 00:15:40,107
"You have to go with
the truth all the way.

157
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:42,510
"Otherwise, what have you
accomplished?"

158
00:15:43,611 --> 00:15:47,214
In one iconic poster,
a little boy with one eye shut,

159
00:15:47,247 --> 00:15:49,016
possibly shot by a soldier,

160
00:15:49,049 --> 00:15:51,719
is juxtaposed with
a child's drawing of a flower

161
00:15:52,119 --> 00:15:52,720
and the words:

162
00:15:53,922 --> 00:15:56,658
"Daddy, what are you doing
in the occupied territories?"

163
00:15:58,158 --> 00:15:59,694
One of his most famous works

164
00:15:59,727 --> 00:16:02,329
was the logo he designed
for the Peace Now Movement

165
00:16:02,362 --> 00:16:03,731
in 1978.

166
00:16:05,098 --> 00:16:09,637
The deceptively simple logo
combines the words "Peace" and "Now"

167
00:16:09,671 --> 00:16:12,439
and uses no other symbol or
design.

168
00:16:13,207 --> 00:16:17,311
It became the first widely used
political sticker in Israel.

169
00:16:19,413 --> 00:16:22,449
His work began to criticize
the political establishment

170
00:16:22,483 --> 00:16:25,152
even more sharply
after the euphoric...

171
00:16:25,553 --> 00:16:26,420
Hello?

172
00:16:26,453 --> 00:16:28,021
Hi, is this David?

173
00:16:28,388 --> 00:16:30,525
No.
This is his husband, Michael.

174
00:16:30,725 --> 00:16:33,026
Hi, Michael,
it's Suzanne Shrib calling

175
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:34,696
from the IBS clinic.

176
00:16:35,395 --> 00:16:36,664
Oh, hi, Suzanne.

177
00:16:37,866 --> 00:16:39,399
Actually I have some terrific
news for you and David.

178
00:16:39,433 --> 00:16:40,300
What's that?

179
00:16:41,168 --> 00:16:42,670
We've located a new surrogate
for you.

180
00:16:43,771 --> 00:16:46,039
I'm sorry,
I'm not sure I understand.

181
00:16:46,073 --> 00:16:48,342
Well, of course we'd like to set up an
appointment for both of you to meet her

182
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:50,277
and give you a chance
to form an impression,

183
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:51,613
see how you feel.

184
00:16:51,646 --> 00:16:53,715
She's young, very bright,

185
00:16:53,748 --> 00:16:56,450
she's getting an MSW at Rutgers.

186
00:16:56,483 --> 00:16:59,621
Sorry, when was the last time
you spoke with David?

187
00:17:00,153 --> 00:17:02,356
Oh, about a month ago.

188
00:17:02,389 --> 00:17:05,158
I promised I'd give him a call
the moment we had a match.

189
00:18:21,401 --> 00:18:22,537
Oh, hi.

190
00:18:23,203 --> 00:18:25,272
Sorry, I didn't know if you're
awake.

191
00:18:25,305 --> 00:18:26,874
I just wanted to take something
I left here.

192
00:18:26,908 --> 00:18:28,275
Oh, no worries, come on inside.

193
00:18:29,376 --> 00:18:30,410
I'll take it and leave,
it's in my room, one minute.

194
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:46,628
Sorry, man,
I just had to grab my weed.

195
00:18:46,828 --> 00:18:48,261
Can't really fall asleep
without it.

196
00:18:48,295 --> 00:18:50,263
Yeah, sure, totally get that.

197
00:18:50,464 --> 00:18:51,866
So, you're good?

198
00:18:52,265 --> 00:18:54,201
You're okay?
Need anything from me?

199
00:18:54,234 --> 00:18:56,871
- You want some of this maybe?
- No, no, I'm good, thank you.

200
00:18:57,739 --> 00:18:59,473
Hey, you hungry?

201
00:18:59,507 --> 00:19:02,677
I just bought some breakfast,
you're welcome to join me.

202
00:19:05,312 --> 00:19:07,949
- "Sweetbox"?
- Yeah, according to my research

203
00:19:07,982 --> 00:19:09,550
it's the best bakery in town.

204
00:19:10,652 --> 00:19:11,385
What?

205
00:19:12,452 --> 00:19:13,353
It's funny that someone
has to come from New York

206
00:19:14,722 --> 00:19:16,591
to tell me that the best bakery
in town is just around the corner.

207
00:19:16,858 --> 00:19:17,759
Are they good?

208
00:19:17,792 --> 00:19:18,926
You're welcome to try one.

209
00:19:20,327 --> 00:19:22,530
To tell you the truth,
I don't really eat anything before lunch.

210
00:19:22,563 --> 00:19:25,533
My breakfast is just black
coffee and a cigarette.

211
00:19:25,566 --> 00:19:26,701
- Do you mind?
- Actually...

212
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:31,539
So,

213
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,575
what are you doing in Israel,
if it's okay to ask?

214
00:19:34,609 --> 00:19:36,678
Of course, I'm a travel writer.

215
00:19:36,711 --> 00:19:38,780
I write a column
for The New York Times.

216
00:19:38,813 --> 00:19:41,582
- Really?
- Yeah, it's called "The Intrepid Traveler."

217
00:19:41,616 --> 00:19:42,650
"Intrepid"?

218
00:19:42,684 --> 00:19:44,451
Intrepid, it means...

219
00:19:44,686 --> 00:19:46,453
I don't know, resourceful?
Brave?

220
00:19:46,486 --> 00:19:47,955
Someone who won't give up,

221
00:19:47,989 --> 00:19:49,724
who's strong in the face of
adversity.

222
00:19:50,992 --> 00:19:52,426
It's just a name though.

223
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:54,494
So you're not really intrepid?

224
00:19:54,762 --> 00:19:55,897
I try to be.

225
00:19:56,798 --> 00:19:58,666
The idea is to write about
the...

226
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:00,333
the city as it really is.

227
00:20:00,367 --> 00:20:03,236
The local city,
not the... the touristy version.

228
00:20:04,939 --> 00:20:06,541
It's your first time in Tel
Aviv?

229
00:20:06,908 --> 00:20:08,475
It's actually my second.

230
00:20:08,676 --> 00:20:10,511
I was here for my Bar-Mitzvah.

231
00:20:10,812 --> 00:20:13,681
But that was in Jerusalem
about 100 years ago.

232
00:20:14,549 --> 00:20:16,017
Probably wasn't such a great
visit

233
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:17,652
if it took you so long to come
back.

234
00:20:17,685 --> 00:20:19,520
You are right about that.

235
00:20:19,554 --> 00:20:21,354
It was kind of a difficult
visit.

236
00:20:21,923 --> 00:20:23,423
My parents were...

237
00:20:23,858 --> 00:20:25,358
They were constantly fighting.

238
00:20:26,661 --> 00:20:28,696
In fact, a couple of months
after that they were divorced.

239
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:30,263
- Oh...
- Yeah.

240
00:20:31,766 --> 00:20:33,000
So what did they say when you told
them that you're coming back here?

241
00:20:33,034 --> 00:20:33,935
Who?

242
00:20:34,736 --> 00:20:36,604
Oh, my parents, oh.

243
00:20:36,637 --> 00:20:38,906
My mom passed away
couple of years ago.

244
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:39,941
I'm sorry, I have to remember

245
00:20:40,875 --> 00:20:41,843
not to ask people over 50
this question,

246
00:20:41,876 --> 00:20:42,810
I always do that.

247
00:20:44,645 --> 00:20:45,713
It's okay.

248
00:20:45,747 --> 00:20:48,315
My dad is still
very much alive and...

249
00:20:48,683 --> 00:20:51,519
I think he'll be happy
when I tell him I came back.

250
00:20:52,787 --> 00:20:55,255
Well, I hope this time
you'll have a better experience.

251
00:20:55,455 --> 00:20:58,559
- Yeah.
- I think Israelis really try to be nice to tourists.

252
00:20:58,593 --> 00:21:01,696
Yeah, they wanna feed you,
they wanna tell you stories,

253
00:21:01,729 --> 00:21:02,630
speak English with you

254
00:21:03,631 --> 00:21:04,297
even if they don't know
how to speak English.

255
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,400
They just want you to like them.

256
00:21:07,769 --> 00:21:09,302
Why do you think that is?

257
00:21:10,972 --> 00:21:12,272
I don't know.

258
00:21:13,273 --> 00:21:14,407
Maybe it's because
we are in the Middle East,

259
00:21:15,408 --> 00:21:16,511
but we wanna be treated
like we are in the West.

260
00:21:16,544 --> 00:21:17,410
Wow.

261
00:21:17,444 --> 00:21:18,946
Can I quote you on that?

262
00:21:20,447 --> 00:21:21,549
Are you making fun of me?

263
00:21:21,582 --> 00:21:22,683
'Cause I was only trying to...

264
00:21:22,717 --> 00:21:24,986
No, no, I wasn't.
I meant that.

265
00:21:25,019 --> 00:21:26,053
That was interesting.

266
00:21:27,588 --> 00:21:28,623
Okay.

267
00:21:29,557 --> 00:21:30,792
So what's the plan?

268
00:21:32,392 --> 00:21:34,729
- You have a plan, right?
- Oh, yes, yes.

269
00:21:34,762 --> 00:21:36,664
Not only do I have a plan,

270
00:21:36,864 --> 00:21:38,032
I have a list.

271
00:21:38,699 --> 00:21:40,735
Everything that's highlighted
in yellow,

272
00:21:40,768 --> 00:21:42,703
that's top priority, then...

273
00:21:42,737 --> 00:21:44,071
Neve Tzedek.

274
00:21:44,672 --> 00:21:46,707
Sarona, Manta Ray Beach,

275
00:21:46,741 --> 00:21:47,842
Tel Aviv Museum.

276
00:21:47,875 --> 00:21:49,510
Aren't all those the must-sees?

277
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:50,945
Yeah, yeah,

278
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:53,848
if you are a Jewish princess
on her Birthright tour, yeah.

279
00:21:54,782 --> 00:21:57,585
These places are like
the most cliché thing ever.

280
00:21:58,820 --> 00:21:59,520
Florentin?

281
00:22:00,521 --> 00:22:01,989
Yeah, we're not gonna go
to Rothschild Boulevard,

282
00:22:02,023 --> 00:22:03,490
you've been there enough.

283
00:22:11,065 --> 00:22:11,833
What's wrong?

284
00:22:12,499 --> 00:22:13,433
They stole my fucking bike.

285
00:22:14,068 --> 00:22:14,869
Second time in six months.

286
00:22:14,902 --> 00:22:16,037
Alright...

287
00:22:16,571 --> 00:22:18,506
Alright, just calm down.

288
00:22:18,873 --> 00:22:19,907
I'm not sure I follow,

289
00:22:21,042 --> 00:22:22,143
you're saying you actually
know who stole your bike?

290
00:22:22,176 --> 00:22:23,044
Not exactly,

291
00:22:24,278 --> 00:22:25,880
but if I'm lucky they sold it
to the bike shop over there.

292
00:22:27,114 --> 00:22:28,749
Last time those fuckers stole my
bike, I found it there.

293
00:23:17,164 --> 00:23:19,133
He's lying,
he said it's not my bike.

294
00:23:19,166 --> 00:23:21,602
He wants me to pay 500 shekels
for my bike.

295
00:23:21,769 --> 00:23:23,938
Why don't you just call the police?
It's your bike.

296
00:23:23,971 --> 00:23:25,640
Forget it, I don't want to do
that.

297
00:23:25,673 --> 00:23:26,540
Why not?

298
00:23:27,375 --> 00:23:28,475
The police in this area are
racists

299
00:23:29,744 --> 00:23:30,912
and the immigrants,
the money they'll have to pay a lawyer,

300
00:23:31,846 --> 00:23:32,880
they'll have to steal
another 30 bikes.

301
00:23:32,914 --> 00:23:33,781
That's decent of you.

302
00:23:34,782 --> 00:23:35,783
I don't think
I could be that cool about it.

303
00:23:36,617 --> 00:23:37,417
I mean, it is your bike, after
all.

304
00:23:38,252 --> 00:23:38,986
I know, I'm gonna come back
later.

305
00:23:39,921 --> 00:23:41,022
I know this guy's son,
I'll talk to him.

306
00:23:49,063 --> 00:23:50,430
Want some juice?

307
00:23:50,731 --> 00:23:51,699
Sure.

308
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:54,168
This is the best pomegranate juice
you're gonna get in Tel Aviv.

309
00:23:54,201 --> 00:23:55,569
Maybe in the world.

310
00:24:04,512 --> 00:24:06,080
Do you have small change maybe?

311
00:24:08,683 --> 00:24:09,517
Thanks.

312
00:24:14,522 --> 00:24:15,890
Oh, you're right, this is good.

313
00:24:15,923 --> 00:24:16,958
I told you.

314
00:24:28,602 --> 00:24:30,004
Thirsty, huh?

315
00:24:30,037 --> 00:24:31,138
Yeah.

316
00:24:34,041 --> 00:24:34,842
You hungry?

317
00:24:35,209 --> 00:24:36,243
A little.

318
00:24:37,745 --> 00:24:39,647
'Cause there's a great restaurant I
know with really great Israeli food.

319
00:24:40,181 --> 00:24:41,015
Sounds good.

320
00:24:41,849 --> 00:24:43,951
But we'll have to wait till
3:00.

321
00:24:44,185 --> 00:24:45,252
Why?

322
00:24:45,286 --> 00:24:46,721
'Cause they have a Happy Hour.

323
00:24:46,754 --> 00:24:48,488
Yeah, all the food is half
price.

324
00:24:48,923 --> 00:24:51,125
Well, it's two hours from now.

325
00:24:51,158 --> 00:24:52,860
If you're hungry, we can go now.

326
00:24:52,893 --> 00:24:53,694
I'm happy to pay.

327
00:24:54,428 --> 00:24:56,063
No, no.
It's okay, I can wait.

328
00:25:42,243 --> 00:25:45,179
It's our special hummus
with "ful," like fava beans.

329
00:25:45,212 --> 00:25:45,913
Sounds good to me.

330
00:25:47,681 --> 00:25:49,583
- So, two hummus with ful.
- Yeah.

331
00:25:49,617 --> 00:25:51,786
One meat soup, one Israeli
salad,

332
00:25:51,819 --> 00:25:53,054
and rice with beans.

333
00:25:53,888 --> 00:25:55,022
- Okay.
- Sounds great.

334
00:25:55,056 --> 00:25:56,257
How about some shots?
On the house?

335
00:25:57,625 --> 00:25:59,293
No, no, I'm great, thank you.

336
00:26:00,795 --> 00:26:01,829
Okay.

337
00:26:01,862 --> 00:26:03,130
You never say no to free shots.

338
00:26:03,164 --> 00:26:04,765
I'm fine with beer,

339
00:26:06,067 --> 00:26:07,935
it's a little early in the day
for me to start drinking arak.

340
00:26:07,968 --> 00:26:09,637
Don't worry, I'll drink yours.

341
00:26:09,970 --> 00:26:11,038
That's for you.

342
00:26:12,106 --> 00:26:13,240
That's for you.

343
00:26:15,076 --> 00:26:17,244
- L'chaim.
- L'chaim.

344
00:26:27,088 --> 00:26:28,155
So...

345
00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:31,092
Do you write only about travel
or also about other things?

346
00:26:31,125 --> 00:26:32,293
What do you mean?

347
00:26:32,326 --> 00:26:33,060
I googled you.

348
00:26:33,727 --> 00:26:35,062
I saw you wrote a book once,

349
00:26:36,163 --> 00:26:37,932
unless there's another writer
named Michael Green.

350
00:26:38,732 --> 00:26:40,167
"Complications,"

351
00:26:40,201 --> 00:26:42,203
it says it was a "thrilling
debut."

352
00:26:42,236 --> 00:26:45,272
Yes, that was many,
many, many years ago.

353
00:26:45,773 --> 00:26:46,774
What was it about?

354
00:26:48,175 --> 00:26:50,077
It's about the world
I lived in back then.

355
00:26:50,711 --> 00:26:52,746
New York City
in the late '80s, early '90s.

356
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:55,049
What, like AIDS and stuff like
that?

357
00:26:55,349 --> 00:26:56,183
Well...

358
00:26:56,784 --> 00:26:57,318
That's so depressing,

359
00:26:58,419 --> 00:26:59,787
why does everything
always has to go back to that?

360
00:27:00,688 --> 00:27:02,723
Well, I didn't go back, I was
there.

361
00:27:02,756 --> 00:27:04,725
I sort of wrote the book in
real-time.

362
00:27:04,959 --> 00:27:07,661
My first boyfriend, he...
he died of AIDS.

363
00:27:08,729 --> 00:27:09,697
Fuck.

364
00:27:18,339 --> 00:27:19,373
Enjoy.

365
00:27:19,406 --> 00:27:20,741
Thank you.

366
00:27:21,275 --> 00:27:22,276
Thanks.

367
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:37,925
Is that not what you ordered?

368
00:27:37,958 --> 00:27:39,894
It is, but I said no onion.

369
00:27:39,927 --> 00:27:40,361
I hate it.

370
00:27:41,195 --> 00:27:42,863
How do you eat food without
onions,

371
00:27:42,897 --> 00:27:44,365
that's what gives it all the
flavor.

372
00:27:44,832 --> 00:27:45,332
Ichs.

373
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,001
What?

374
00:27:47,935 --> 00:27:51,305
Ah, "ichs," it's like Hebrew
for "yuck."

375
00:27:51,805 --> 00:27:52,840
Ah.

376
00:27:52,873 --> 00:27:53,674
Icks.

377
00:27:54,141 --> 00:27:55,976
Not "icks." Ichs.

378
00:27:56,944 --> 00:27:58,112
Ichs.

379
00:28:03,284 --> 00:28:05,753
So, um, what about you, Tomer?

380
00:28:06,053 --> 00:28:08,289
What kind of movies
do you wanna make in the future?

381
00:28:08,923 --> 00:28:10,324
Why in the future?
I'm already making them.

382
00:28:10,357 --> 00:28:11,792
Oh, great.

383
00:28:11,825 --> 00:28:13,060
So, what are they about?

384
00:28:13,894 --> 00:28:15,229
What are they about?

385
00:28:16,063 --> 00:28:18,065
It's hard to explain.

386
00:28:18,098 --> 00:28:21,001
It's kind of "artistic horror,"
I guess,

387
00:28:21,035 --> 00:28:25,139
but I don't wanna, like,
put it in a box, you know? I...

388
00:28:25,172 --> 00:28:28,042
I wanna make films that will
punch you in the face, you know?

389
00:28:28,075 --> 00:28:31,178
I'd rather make my audience vomit
than just being fine with it.

390
00:28:32,213 --> 00:28:35,849
Yeah, I think cinema should
physically shake you up,

391
00:28:35,883 --> 00:28:37,484
like, like a rollercoaster.

392
00:28:39,521 --> 00:28:40,821
Okay.

393
00:28:46,493 --> 00:28:47,895
You have my number
if you need anything.

394
00:28:49,063 --> 00:28:50,297
Yeah. You have everything
you need from the apartment?

395
00:28:50,331 --> 00:28:51,265
Yeah.

396
00:28:52,066 --> 00:28:53,234
Where are you staying?

397
00:28:54,001 --> 00:28:54,835
Last night I went to my mother,

398
00:28:54,868 --> 00:28:57,137
but I don't do it again,
it's too far.

399
00:28:57,572 --> 00:28:59,173
Where will you be tonight?

400
00:28:59,574 --> 00:29:00,808
Not sure.

401
00:29:03,010 --> 00:29:04,812
You know what's the shittiest
thing?

402
00:29:06,113 --> 00:29:07,781
Maybe I forgot to lock them.

403
00:29:08,916 --> 00:29:10,317
I forget sometimes.

404
00:29:11,318 --> 00:29:13,787
So, have fun, yeah?

405
00:29:13,821 --> 00:29:14,955
Enjoy real Tel Aviv.

406
00:29:16,323 --> 00:29:17,424
Wait.

407
00:29:18,392 --> 00:29:20,127
What don't you just
stay here tonight?

408
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:22,196
Until you figure something out.

409
00:29:22,229 --> 00:29:23,531
Thanks, but it's cool.

410
00:29:24,798 --> 00:29:26,467
I'm used to subletting my place
and crashing at other people's.

411
00:29:27,067 --> 00:29:28,102
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

412
00:29:28,135 --> 00:29:30,304
I mean,
you could stay on the sofa.

413
00:29:30,904 --> 00:29:33,807
Maybe in return you could
continue to be my tour guide.

414
00:29:34,208 --> 00:29:36,810
Keep showing me around the city
like you did today?

415
00:29:38,078 --> 00:29:39,780
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

416
00:29:40,948 --> 00:29:44,318
What if I'm like, a serial
killer?

417
00:29:44,351 --> 00:29:46,353
Or you, you could be a serial killer.
I mean,

418
00:29:47,054 --> 00:29:48,088
you never know.

419
00:30:02,369 --> 00:30:04,038
It's that one.

420
00:30:17,619 --> 00:30:19,920
So, I could just be here.

421
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:22,489
And you don't have to worry
about me.

422
00:30:22,524 --> 00:30:23,525
Okay.

423
00:32:20,441 --> 00:32:21,676
Very well done.

424
00:32:23,778 --> 00:32:25,078
Okay.

425
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:26,514
Anything else?

426
00:32:28,382 --> 00:32:31,619
Horror movies aren't really my
thing, to be honest. I...

427
00:32:32,587 --> 00:32:35,355
- I don't always understand
- You don't need to understand.

428
00:32:35,389 --> 00:32:37,090
It's... it's what you feel.

429
00:32:37,124 --> 00:32:39,226
It's a physical experience.

430
00:32:39,259 --> 00:32:41,228
Oh, so, it's not meant to be
scary?

431
00:32:41,261 --> 00:32:42,730
It's not meant to be anything,

432
00:32:43,163 --> 00:32:44,732
it's what you bring to it,
it's...

433
00:32:45,199 --> 00:32:46,366
it's what you see.

434
00:32:46,801 --> 00:32:48,435
Oh, interesting.

435
00:32:50,370 --> 00:32:51,706
"Interesting..."

436
00:32:51,739 --> 00:32:52,406
What?

437
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,174
You're probably into what?

438
00:32:54,208 --> 00:32:56,176
Romantic comedies, musicals?

439
00:32:56,644 --> 00:32:57,579
Is that a crime?

440
00:32:57,612 --> 00:32:58,546
No,

441
00:32:59,814 --> 00:33:01,683
but it's very unoriginal to be
a gay man who loves musicals.

442
00:33:03,116 --> 00:33:04,552
What, do you have like a poster of
Liza Minnelli in your living room?

443
00:33:07,054 --> 00:33:08,288
What's wrong with musicals?

444
00:33:08,823 --> 00:33:11,325
Nothing, and that's the problem.

445
00:33:11,358 --> 00:33:13,695
Everyone is so happy and so gay.

446
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:14,629
And what's wrong with that?

447
00:33:15,763 --> 00:33:17,565
It's not a question of wrong,
it's a question of...

448
00:33:18,165 --> 00:33:20,434
Not all of us like cheesy
romance and happy endings.

449
00:33:25,673 --> 00:33:26,440
Tomer!

450
00:33:33,146 --> 00:33:35,115
Michael, Daria. Daria, Michael.

451
00:33:35,148 --> 00:33:37,117
Hey, it's nice to meet you.

452
00:33:38,385 --> 00:33:40,153
We just saw you in Tomer's film,

453
00:33:40,454 --> 00:33:41,288
you were very good.

454
00:33:42,122 --> 00:33:42,489
Don't believe him, he didn't
like it.

455
00:33:43,390 --> 00:33:44,391
I did.

456
00:33:45,827 --> 00:33:47,160
You're welcome to come in.

457
00:33:56,838 --> 00:33:58,706
Daria and her boyfriend Amir
had a fight.

458
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:00,307
We didn't fight, we broke up.

459
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:02,109
Don't worry,
this happens every two weeks.

460
00:34:02,142 --> 00:34:04,444
I think they do it just to have
a lot of make-up sex.

461
00:34:04,478 --> 00:34:06,113
This time it's different, Tomer.

462
00:34:06,146 --> 00:34:08,348
- What did he do this time?
- What did he do?

463
00:34:08,382 --> 00:34:11,151
Well, right in the middle of
rehearsal he stops everything

464
00:34:11,184 --> 00:34:12,352
and says I'm ruining the dance.

465
00:34:12,386 --> 00:34:12,787
Me?

466
00:34:13,487 --> 00:34:14,656
He cursed me in fucking Arabic

467
00:34:15,924 --> 00:34:17,057
and it wasn't about anything
that happened in the rehearsal,

468
00:34:18,425 --> 00:34:20,595
it was all about something I said
about his family a few days ago.

469
00:34:20,628 --> 00:34:22,195
What did you say
about his family?

470
00:34:22,229 --> 00:34:23,765
That maybe he shouldn't invite
them.

471
00:34:23,798 --> 00:34:25,399
That maybe it's not for them,

472
00:34:25,432 --> 00:34:26,834
maybe it's too provocative.

473
00:34:27,902 --> 00:34:30,070
I didn't say it
in a racist way, you know?

474
00:34:30,237 --> 00:34:31,839
In what?

475
00:34:31,873 --> 00:34:33,140
- Racist way!
- Oh.

476
00:34:34,341 --> 00:34:36,109
Fuck, I don't know if I want
my parents to come either.

477
00:34:36,143 --> 00:34:38,345
Daria and Amir have a dance show
that opens tomorrow.

478
00:34:38,378 --> 00:34:40,682
Oh, great! I love dance.

479
00:34:40,715 --> 00:34:41,716
Yeah.

480
00:34:44,786 --> 00:34:47,387
Here, you're invited.

481
00:34:49,624 --> 00:34:51,491
Oh, it's interesting.

482
00:34:51,526 --> 00:34:52,594
Is this Arabic?

483
00:34:53,628 --> 00:34:55,362
Yes, Amir is Arabic.

484
00:34:55,395 --> 00:34:57,665
And also a pain in the ass.

485
00:34:57,699 --> 00:35:00,702
So everything we do
has to have Arabic in it.

486
00:35:00,735 --> 00:35:02,870
Even if it's not connected at
all.

487
00:35:02,904 --> 00:35:05,439
Tomorrow is their premiere and then
they're moving to Berlin together.

488
00:35:05,472 --> 00:35:07,675
- Yeah...
- Wait, you're leaving Israel?

489
00:35:08,643 --> 00:35:09,409
Yes.

490
00:35:09,844 --> 00:35:10,912
But I thought you were breaking
up.

491
00:35:10,945 --> 00:35:12,346
We are breaking up.

492
00:35:12,379 --> 00:35:13,648
So why are you moving
to Berlin with him?

493
00:35:15,415 --> 00:35:16,618
My best friend is dumping me.

494
00:35:16,651 --> 00:35:18,318
I told you, you could come too,

495
00:35:18,352 --> 00:35:19,219
but you didn't want to.

496
00:35:20,655 --> 00:35:22,389
Of course I want to but I need to
finish university first, you know.

497
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:23,791
Tomer can't move away

498
00:35:23,825 --> 00:35:26,293
because his mother is stuck
in the kibbutz.

499
00:35:26,326 --> 00:35:27,494
He will never leave her.

500
00:35:27,528 --> 00:35:28,161
That's bullshit.

501
00:35:29,429 --> 00:35:31,833
So, what do you plan
on doing in Berlin?

502
00:35:33,735 --> 00:35:36,269
Basically the same thing, dance,

503
00:35:36,303 --> 00:35:38,305
only with some more people
in the audience.

504
00:35:38,338 --> 00:35:41,308
Maybe there I can afford more
than a kid's meal at McDonald's.

505
00:35:41,341 --> 00:35:42,442
Wow.

506
00:35:42,476 --> 00:35:44,144
Is that the big dream then?

507
00:35:45,546 --> 00:35:46,948
What, a Big Mac?

508
00:35:46,981 --> 00:35:48,716
Oh, no, I'm fine. Thank you.

509
00:35:49,483 --> 00:35:50,551
I don't know...

510
00:35:51,753 --> 00:35:53,453
I guess I've just given up
trying to make it happen here.

511
00:35:54,388 --> 00:35:55,422
Why?

512
00:35:58,559 --> 00:36:00,828
It's so hard to be
an artist here, you know?

513
00:36:00,862 --> 00:36:02,897
You have to beg
the government for budgets

514
00:36:02,930 --> 00:36:04,398
and then pray that anyone comes,

515
00:36:04,431 --> 00:36:07,267
especially if your partner
is a Palestinian.

516
00:36:08,335 --> 00:36:11,238
A couple of years ago,
we had a big new show.

517
00:36:12,439 --> 00:36:14,374
A week before the premiere,

518
00:36:14,976 --> 00:36:16,911
everything in Gaza got crazy.

519
00:36:16,944 --> 00:36:18,746
Like, missile attacks, bombings,

520
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:20,180
you know, all that shit.

521
00:36:21,348 --> 00:36:23,851
And at the end we performed
in front of three people.

522
00:36:23,885 --> 00:36:25,218
Tomer was one of them.

523
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:30,591
Well, I hate to be the guy who
says, "When I was your age," but...

524
00:36:30,625 --> 00:36:31,693
"When I was your age..."

525
00:36:31,726 --> 00:36:33,594
But, really,

526
00:36:34,562 --> 00:36:36,964
we protested, we got arrested.

527
00:36:37,431 --> 00:36:39,499
We did everything we could
to change the world.

528
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,669
Maybe it wasn't very much,

529
00:36:41,703 --> 00:36:44,471
but some... some things did
change.

530
00:36:48,609 --> 00:36:49,744
I don't know,

531
00:36:50,578 --> 00:36:52,914
maybe this is my protest,

532
00:36:52,947 --> 00:36:57,350
to leave this place and think
only of myself for once.

533
00:36:57,384 --> 00:36:58,586
To really live,

534
00:36:58,986 --> 00:37:00,621
not only survive.

535
00:37:02,724 --> 00:37:04,959
Isn't it odd that
you're moving to Germany?

536
00:37:05,526 --> 00:37:08,730
A place that symbolizes
Jewish tragedy.

537
00:37:19,473 --> 00:37:20,007
What's so funny?

538
00:37:21,209 --> 00:37:22,977
Nothing, we're just high,
but you know that Berlin is like

539
00:37:23,010 --> 00:37:24,812
the coolest place for many
years.

540
00:37:24,846 --> 00:37:26,748
Tons of young Israelis move
there.

541
00:37:39,627 --> 00:37:40,595
Come.

542
00:39:38,946 --> 00:39:39,814
Michael!

543
00:39:58,799 --> 00:39:59,800
Hey.

544
00:40:01,068 --> 00:40:02,503
Look what I have.

545
00:40:04,672 --> 00:40:05,907
- Wow.
- I cut class today

546
00:40:07,208 --> 00:40:09,710
and on the way here I stopped at
this like second-hand bookshop

547
00:40:09,744 --> 00:40:11,012
and that's where I found it.

548
00:40:11,045 --> 00:40:12,046
How cool is that?

549
00:40:15,182 --> 00:40:16,183
Tomer.

550
00:40:48,883 --> 00:40:49,917
Bye.

551
00:40:59,193 --> 00:41:00,628
Is that your boyfriend?

552
00:41:02,263 --> 00:41:03,764
I don't have a boyfriend.

553
00:41:04,699 --> 00:41:06,499
We're just hanging out, that's
all.

554
00:41:07,735 --> 00:41:10,071
He wanted more,
but I'm not into all that.

555
00:41:10,805 --> 00:41:11,906
Why?

556
00:41:13,074 --> 00:41:13,708
Just not.

557
00:41:14,942 --> 00:41:18,512
People today are so desperate
for love and relationships,

558
00:41:18,713 --> 00:41:19,680
so when they meet someone cool

559
00:41:20,681 --> 00:41:22,482
they immediately want to define
and label and...

560
00:41:23,884 --> 00:41:26,253
I mean, why would I wanna have sex
with only one person, you know?

561
00:41:27,154 --> 00:41:29,590
I don't wanna
tie myself down to anyone.

562
00:41:29,623 --> 00:41:30,958
A man, a woman.

563
00:41:30,992 --> 00:41:32,226
One partner, two partners,

564
00:41:32,259 --> 00:41:34,695
even 100 partners, you know?
I just...

565
00:41:35,830 --> 00:41:37,832
I want to enjoy everything
life has to offer.

566
00:41:39,333 --> 00:41:43,738
Sure, but one of the things this
world has to offer is the...

567
00:41:43,771 --> 00:41:45,606
the love of another human being.

568
00:41:46,574 --> 00:41:48,943
Some might even say it's the
best thing life has to offer.

569
00:41:53,647 --> 00:41:54,715
Do you still fuck?

570
00:41:55,983 --> 00:41:57,084
Excuse me?

571
00:41:57,885 --> 00:41:58,953
You and...

572
00:41:58,986 --> 00:42:00,988
David, you still have sex?

573
00:42:01,989 --> 00:42:03,891
- Well...
- You don't have to answer this question

574
00:42:03,924 --> 00:42:05,259
- if you don't want to.
- No, no.

575
00:42:05,292 --> 00:42:08,863
I'm perfectly okay answering,
it's just that, well...

576
00:42:09,964 --> 00:42:12,767
Yeah, we do occasionally have
sex.

577
00:42:14,001 --> 00:42:15,136
Occasionally?

578
00:42:15,836 --> 00:42:16,837
What does it mean?

579
00:42:18,072 --> 00:42:20,708
What does that mean?
It means occasionally.

580
00:42:22,309 --> 00:42:24,612
Obviously, as a relationship
evolves

581
00:42:24,645 --> 00:42:27,281
some things happen less
frequently than they once did.

582
00:42:27,715 --> 00:42:29,917
And I'm not just talking about
sex.

583
00:42:30,651 --> 00:42:31,852
Lots of things change.

584
00:42:32,953 --> 00:42:34,655
So you have an open
relationship?

585
00:42:34,688 --> 00:42:35,890
No...

586
00:42:36,757 --> 00:42:37,792
Not as far as I know.

587
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:41,062
Wow.

588
00:42:42,263 --> 00:42:43,931
I can't imagine no sex-life,
I mean, that would kill me.

589
00:42:44,131 --> 00:42:45,599
Well, I didn't say there was
no...

590
00:42:45,633 --> 00:42:47,168
Forget about sex, just...

591
00:42:47,735 --> 00:42:48,903
kissing.

592
00:42:49,203 --> 00:42:50,938
I mean, don't you miss it?
Like...

593
00:42:51,772 --> 00:42:54,775
Like a really good kiss that
makes you forget about everything,

594
00:42:54,809 --> 00:42:55,643
you know?

595
00:42:59,246 --> 00:43:00,281
You're a funny one.

596
00:43:01,749 --> 00:43:02,650
Why?

597
00:43:03,617 --> 00:43:06,020
Because for
Mr. I-don't-want-a-boyfriend-

598
00:43:06,053 --> 00:43:06,987
no-happy-endings,

599
00:43:08,122 --> 00:43:11,158
you sound pretty romantic
about the power of a kiss.

600
00:43:16,297 --> 00:43:17,865
I'm gonna take a shower.

601
00:44:35,342 --> 00:44:36,377
Hey! Hey!

602
00:44:36,410 --> 00:44:38,712
It's okay, it's okay.
Shh...

603
00:44:38,946 --> 00:44:40,381
Shh...

604
00:44:41,516 --> 00:44:42,750
Hey!

605
00:44:45,853 --> 00:44:47,054
He fell in the water.

606
00:44:48,222 --> 00:44:49,290
I'm sorry,
I was just worried he might...

607
00:44:51,759 --> 00:44:53,294
- Michal!
- I was just, I was only trying to help,

608
00:44:53,327 --> 00:44:54,461
I saw the baby going in the
water.

609
00:44:56,931 --> 00:44:58,832
I was only trying to help,
I saw him fall and...

610
00:44:58,866 --> 00:44:59,333
It's okay.

611
00:45:04,171 --> 00:45:05,072
I'm really sorry.

612
00:45:05,973 --> 00:45:06,874
- Come on.
- It's okay, forget about it.

613
00:45:15,049 --> 00:45:16,217
Jesus.

614
00:46:02,530 --> 00:46:03,531
Hey you.

615
00:46:03,565 --> 00:46:04,431
Hi.

616
00:46:05,132 --> 00:46:06,367
Everything okay?

617
00:46:06,568 --> 00:46:08,168
Yeah, everything's fine.

618
00:46:08,202 --> 00:46:09,537
Tried you earlier.

619
00:46:09,571 --> 00:46:11,071
I know, I was busy.

620
00:46:13,073 --> 00:46:16,110
Okay, listen,
I just, I talked to Suzanne,

621
00:46:16,143 --> 00:46:18,178
I know she called you earlier,

622
00:46:18,212 --> 00:46:20,281
she wasn't supposed to do that.

623
00:46:20,314 --> 00:46:21,915
I'm really sorry, okay?

624
00:46:21,949 --> 00:46:23,384
But let's just wait
till you get home

625
00:46:23,417 --> 00:46:25,019
and we can talk
about this together,

626
00:46:25,052 --> 00:46:25,786
just the two of us.

627
00:46:26,987 --> 00:46:29,524
I mean, at the end of the day,
this is good news, right?

628
00:46:29,923 --> 00:46:32,826
Yeah, I thought it was something we
were supposed to be doing together.

629
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:34,094
Michael, come on,

630
00:46:35,429 --> 00:46:37,998
you realize this is just the
first step of a very long process.

631
00:46:38,032 --> 00:46:41,101
- Don't you remember?
- I realize you want this more than I do,

632
00:46:41,135 --> 00:46:43,937
enough to, you know,
go get the ball rolling behind my back.

633
00:46:44,606 --> 00:46:46,874
No, actually, I...

634
00:46:48,475 --> 00:46:51,045
Michael, no balls are rolling

635
00:46:51,078 --> 00:46:52,413
and if you don't wanna talk to
her

636
00:46:52,446 --> 00:46:55,115
I will call Suzanne
and I will let her know.

637
00:46:55,883 --> 00:46:57,885
But from the information
that has been shared with me

638
00:46:57,918 --> 00:47:00,054
this woman sounds pretty
amazing.

639
00:47:01,088 --> 00:47:03,123
- Maybe even better than Ashley.
- I don't wanna meet her.

640
00:47:04,124 --> 00:47:05,326
I don't wanna meet anyone.

641
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:06,927
Wait, what do you mean?

642
00:47:07,361 --> 00:47:09,029
I want us to let it go.

643
00:47:10,331 --> 00:47:12,099
- Let what go?
- You know what.

644
00:47:12,933 --> 00:47:15,035
This, the baby.

645
00:47:15,235 --> 00:47:16,337
All of it.

646
00:47:17,004 --> 00:47:18,072
Maybe it was a mistake.

647
00:47:19,206 --> 00:47:21,576
Michael, I'm very sorry
this happened,

648
00:47:21,609 --> 00:47:24,278
but you don't get to just
unilaterally decide this,

649
00:47:24,311 --> 00:47:25,946
- we got to talk about...
- Hold on.

650
00:47:29,149 --> 00:47:31,553
Sorry to disturb, but we need
to go if we don't wanna be late.

651
00:47:31,586 --> 00:47:33,454
Of course, just give me a
second.

652
00:47:33,487 --> 00:47:34,488
Okay.

653
00:47:41,395 --> 00:47:42,329
Who was that?

654
00:47:42,363 --> 00:47:44,932
It was my... landlord.

655
00:47:45,332 --> 00:47:46,967
He's invited me to a dance
thing.

656
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:47,935
A dance thing?

657
00:47:49,036 --> 00:47:50,437
Yes, some of his friends
are performing at something,

658
00:47:50,471 --> 00:47:52,172
I really should get going.

659
00:47:52,540 --> 00:47:53,541
Fine.

660
00:47:54,308 --> 00:47:55,909
- Enjoy the dance.
- Yeah, okay.

661
00:51:00,528 --> 00:51:01,328
Come dance with us.

662
00:51:02,030 --> 00:51:03,330
Ah, I think I'm gonna go home.

663
00:51:04,364 --> 00:51:05,767
- What?
- Yeah, I've had a few too many drinks

664
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:07,100
and you know, all the jetlag.

665
00:51:07,134 --> 00:51:07,802
Have some MD.

666
00:51:08,636 --> 00:51:09,837
- What?
- MDMA, it will wake you up.

667
00:51:09,871 --> 00:51:11,371
I'm good, thank you.

668
00:51:11,806 --> 00:51:12,640
Ever tried it?

669
00:51:13,608 --> 00:51:15,475
Ah, yes, I've tried some
back in my twenties.

670
00:51:16,343 --> 00:51:17,377
The 1920s?

671
00:51:17,579 --> 00:51:18,780
Very funny.

672
00:51:20,648 --> 00:51:22,750
Go, go, have a good time.

673
00:51:23,518 --> 00:51:24,284
I'll see you back home.

674
00:51:44,706 --> 00:51:46,406
Wow, home already?

675
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:47,809
What, the party is over?

676
00:51:48,275 --> 00:51:49,577
You're wearing pajamas.

677
00:51:50,410 --> 00:51:51,512
Yes, I am, and?

678
00:51:51,913 --> 00:51:53,280
Who wears pajamas?

679
00:51:53,514 --> 00:51:54,549
A lot of people.

680
00:51:54,749 --> 00:51:56,784
Really? Where? In Downton Abbey?

681
00:51:57,885 --> 00:52:01,455
Well, my dad wore pajamas,
my grandfather did as well,

682
00:52:01,789 --> 00:52:05,225
which makes me a proud
third-generation pajama wearer.

683
00:52:06,293 --> 00:52:07,762
Exactly, it's a grandfather
thing.

684
00:52:09,764 --> 00:52:12,265
Why do you always gotta make
me feel like such an old man?

685
00:52:12,734 --> 00:52:14,769
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to do
that,

686
00:52:14,802 --> 00:52:16,671
I don't see you
as an old man, really.

687
00:52:19,272 --> 00:52:20,407
What's that?

688
00:52:20,975 --> 00:52:22,610
This guy on "Atraf."

689
00:52:22,810 --> 00:52:23,711
"Atraf"?

690
00:52:23,745 --> 00:52:25,680
The Israeli Grindr.

691
00:52:26,246 --> 00:52:27,481
Oh, okay.

692
00:52:28,850 --> 00:52:31,686
So this guy is texting me
all the time

693
00:52:31,886 --> 00:52:33,921
and he wants me to treat him
like a chair.

694
00:52:34,656 --> 00:52:36,390
And it's a pity,
'cause look, he's really hot.

695
00:52:38,492 --> 00:52:39,894
I really don't get this.

696
00:52:40,595 --> 00:52:41,596
What's not to get?

697
00:52:42,730 --> 00:52:44,832
I don't know,
ordering in sex like it's a pizza.

698
00:52:45,465 --> 00:52:47,568
How is that any way
to meet somebody?

699
00:52:47,602 --> 00:52:49,804
A quick way, no drama.

700
00:52:51,506 --> 00:52:52,907
You see,
all these guys are very close.

701
00:52:57,578 --> 00:52:58,478
What do you think about him?

702
00:53:00,380 --> 00:53:01,649
He's good looking.

703
00:53:03,250 --> 00:53:04,652
- Really?
- Yeah, I mean...

704
00:53:04,686 --> 00:53:07,555
Come on, how do you
resist a body like that?

705
00:53:08,956 --> 00:53:10,591
Should I ask him to come over?

706
00:53:12,426 --> 00:53:13,528
What, for me?

707
00:53:14,261 --> 00:53:15,129
For us.

708
00:53:16,831 --> 00:53:18,900
I have...
I don't know, I don't think so.

709
00:53:18,933 --> 00:53:21,268
Too late,
he's gonna be here in 7 minutes.

710
00:53:28,509 --> 00:53:29,577
Hi.

711
00:53:29,844 --> 00:53:30,912
Hi.

712
00:53:36,050 --> 00:53:37,250
Hi.

713
00:53:38,586 --> 00:53:39,419
Hi.

714
00:53:39,453 --> 00:53:40,188
I'm Michael.

715
00:53:41,321 --> 00:53:43,423
Kobi.
Nice... nice to meet you.

716
00:53:45,660 --> 00:53:47,394
Come on in, have a seat.

717
00:53:58,039 --> 00:53:58,840
Nice pajamas.

718
00:53:59,807 --> 00:54:02,777
Thanks, they've been
in my family for years.

719
00:54:10,450 --> 00:54:11,552
Where are you from?

720
00:54:11,786 --> 00:54:14,655
I'm, uh, from the US.
New York City.

721
00:54:15,489 --> 00:54:16,724
Cool, cool.

722
00:54:17,357 --> 00:54:19,527
I never been, I would love to
go.

723
00:54:21,562 --> 00:54:22,530
Well, you should.

724
00:54:22,897 --> 00:54:23,731
I will.

725
00:54:24,599 --> 00:54:26,768
It's very expensive right now,
but...

726
00:54:27,101 --> 00:54:28,301
I will.

727
00:54:42,784 --> 00:54:44,986
Are you two a couple?

728
00:54:46,654 --> 00:54:49,356
No, no, I'm here on business.

729
00:54:50,024 --> 00:54:52,059
Okay, what do you do?

730
00:54:52,093 --> 00:54:54,695
I'm a journalist. A writer.

731
00:54:54,729 --> 00:54:56,363
He writes for The New York
Times,

732
00:54:56,597 --> 00:54:57,865
so you better be good.

733
00:56:48,475 --> 00:56:49,543
Good night.

734
00:57:10,598 --> 00:57:12,166
Oh, fuck...

735
00:57:52,873 --> 00:57:53,841
Fuck.

736
00:58:02,650 --> 00:58:03,718
Michael.

737
00:59:54,028 --> 00:59:56,097
Hey, what's going on?

738
00:59:56,430 --> 00:59:57,932
Hi, Tomer.

739
00:59:58,399 --> 00:59:59,967
I think it's best if I got a
hotel.

740
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,335
- What?
- I really need to work and...

741
01:00:01,368 --> 01:00:02,670
Why? What happened?

742
01:00:03,771 --> 01:00:06,040
Don't worry, you'll be paid in
full.

743
01:00:06,073 --> 01:00:06,674
Why are you going?

744
01:00:07,441 --> 01:00:09,310
- Are you Michael?
- Yes.

745
01:00:09,343 --> 01:00:11,779
Michael, wait, please.
I got us muffins, come on.

746
01:00:11,812 --> 01:00:12,913
Stay.

747
01:00:13,180 --> 01:00:14,982
You have one more night,
why would you...

748
01:00:15,216 --> 01:00:17,918
Also my mom wants you to come to
the kibbutz for dinner, she...

749
01:00:18,285 --> 01:00:19,854
She's cooking non-stop
since last night,

750
01:00:19,887 --> 01:00:20,888
she'll kill me if you don't
come.

751
01:00:33,033 --> 01:00:34,168
Stay.

752
01:00:35,336 --> 01:00:37,004
It's okay, you can go.

753
01:01:31,458 --> 01:01:33,093
See this place over there?

754
01:01:34,094 --> 01:01:35,930
There was my first kiss.

755
01:01:36,797 --> 01:01:38,265
Maya Noodleman.

756
01:01:38,299 --> 01:01:40,267
We were 11.

757
01:01:41,001 --> 01:01:43,837
Yeah... We went behind
one of the machines and kissed

758
01:01:43,871 --> 01:01:45,306
until she started to cry,

759
01:01:45,839 --> 01:01:47,408
'cause a bee stung her
in the eye.

760
01:01:49,910 --> 01:01:50,444
They used to make honey here,

761
01:01:51,312 --> 01:01:53,781
that's what made
the kibbutz so famous.

762
01:01:53,814 --> 01:01:54,915
Oh, sweet,

763
01:01:55,249 --> 01:01:56,784
never been to a honey factory.

764
01:01:57,051 --> 01:01:59,486
Oh no, they stopped making
honey here many years ago.

765
01:02:00,020 --> 01:02:01,889
They sold everything to some...

766
01:02:02,223 --> 01:02:05,759
giant global corporation, you
know.

767
01:02:06,093 --> 01:02:08,395
They still use
the kibbutz logo for sales.

768
01:02:08,429 --> 01:02:10,397
To keep it authentic, you know.

769
01:02:10,431 --> 01:02:11,732
That's a pity.

770
01:02:12,399 --> 01:02:14,301
Yeah, maybe.

771
01:02:32,186 --> 01:02:33,454
Nice to meet you, I'm Malka.

772
01:02:33,487 --> 01:02:35,389
I'm Michael,
really nice to meet you.

773
01:02:41,395 --> 01:02:44,932
I'm very sorry I didn't have
much time to prepare a lot.

774
01:02:44,965 --> 01:02:47,201
Tomer only told me that you are
coming in the last minute.

775
01:02:52,607 --> 01:02:54,375
- This is so wonderful.
- Thank you.

776
01:02:54,408 --> 01:02:56,410
Especially this,
what's this called again?

777
01:02:59,313 --> 01:03:02,116
It's my mom's top-secret
pumpkin tahini.

778
01:03:02,283 --> 01:03:04,285
She won't reveal the recipe to
anyone.

779
01:03:04,318 --> 01:03:07,221
I don't blame her,
it's really delicious, thank you.

780
01:03:07,855 --> 01:03:09,790
Tomer is also a good cook.

781
01:03:10,057 --> 01:03:12,860
He knows how to make
a good Israeli breakfast.

782
01:03:13,561 --> 01:03:15,095
Have you made him one?

783
01:03:15,396 --> 01:03:16,997
Didn't have the time yet.

784
01:03:17,965 --> 01:03:19,400
How long are you going to stay?

785
01:03:20,501 --> 01:03:21,935
I leave tomorrow.

786
01:03:21,969 --> 01:03:23,971
- Already?
- Yeah, just here for work.

787
01:03:24,606 --> 01:03:27,975
The idea is to see how much
I can discover about a city

788
01:03:28,008 --> 01:03:28,442
in just five days.

789
01:03:29,376 --> 01:03:31,412
And what did you discover
about Tel Aviv?

790
01:03:34,882 --> 01:03:36,016
I don't know...

791
01:03:36,450 --> 01:03:38,485
Maybe that it's full of
contradictions?

792
01:03:38,520 --> 01:03:41,255
You know, it's chaotic and
tense,

793
01:03:41,288 --> 01:03:44,024
but at the same time
it's completely laid back.

794
01:03:45,392 --> 01:03:46,960
It's unlike any other place
I've visited.

795
01:03:47,227 --> 01:03:50,331
But that maybe because
Tomer here was my guide.

796
01:03:51,031 --> 01:03:54,401
I've enjoyed having him around,
seeing the city through his eyes.

797
01:03:55,035 --> 01:03:56,970
I'm sure the feeling is mutual.

798
01:03:57,004 --> 01:03:58,939
He never brings anyone back
to the kibbutz.

799
01:04:00,974 --> 01:04:02,176
I'm embarrassing you?

800
01:04:03,277 --> 01:04:06,180
I used to be the cool mom,
once upon a time.

801
01:04:06,213 --> 01:04:07,448
I was in all his movies,

802
01:04:08,449 --> 01:04:11,418
but now if only he could,
he would, poof,

803
01:04:11,452 --> 01:04:12,386
make me disappear.

804
01:04:12,654 --> 01:04:14,221
I wouldn't make you disappear,

805
01:04:14,421 --> 01:04:16,323
but I might hit
the mute button sometimes.

806
01:04:22,996 --> 01:04:24,064
Do you have children, Michael?

807
01:04:25,366 --> 01:04:26,934
No, no, I don't.

808
01:04:27,535 --> 01:04:29,236
And you've never wanted any?

809
01:04:30,137 --> 01:04:33,006
Tomer mentioned that you have
a partner for many years.

810
01:04:33,040 --> 01:04:36,009
Yes, well,
when we were the right age,

811
01:04:36,043 --> 01:04:38,613
it was much less common
for gay men to have children,

812
01:04:38,646 --> 01:04:41,448
and now that it's actually
a viable option...

813
01:04:42,216 --> 01:04:43,417
I guess we're just too old.

814
01:04:43,450 --> 01:04:45,152
What are you talking about?

815
01:04:45,185 --> 01:04:47,955
Here in the kibbutz
there is a couple, two women,

816
01:04:47,988 --> 01:04:49,289
not young at all,

817
01:04:49,323 --> 01:04:51,158
that just had beautiful twins.

818
01:04:51,191 --> 01:04:52,359
Everything is possible now.

819
01:04:53,026 --> 01:04:54,495
You know, if only I could,

820
01:04:54,529 --> 01:04:56,598
I would have a few more like
him.

821
01:04:57,097 --> 01:04:58,999
That's the only one thing I...

822
01:05:03,203 --> 01:05:04,938
- Regret.
- Regret, yeah.

823
01:05:04,972 --> 01:05:06,440
Not having more children.

824
01:05:07,542 --> 01:05:09,276
You know, I had him on my own,

825
01:05:09,309 --> 01:05:12,012
well, with a little help
from the sperm bank,

826
01:05:12,446 --> 01:05:15,115
also not the most traditional
thing,

827
01:05:15,149 --> 01:05:16,984
especially here in the kibbutz.

828
01:05:17,017 --> 01:05:19,319
Everybody said, "This is not
right,

829
01:05:19,353 --> 01:05:21,556
"a child should grow up
with a father,"

830
01:05:21,589 --> 01:05:23,323
but I think it's bullshit.

831
01:05:23,357 --> 01:05:24,659
Father, mother...

832
01:05:25,058 --> 01:05:27,595
The only thing a child needs
to grow up is love.

833
01:05:28,195 --> 01:05:30,197
Well, you did a great job
with this one,

834
01:05:30,532 --> 01:05:31,965
congratulations.

835
01:05:33,568 --> 01:05:34,368
L'chaim!

836
01:05:35,369 --> 01:05:36,403
But listen, Michael,

837
01:05:37,137 --> 01:05:38,706
it's never too late
to have a child.

838
01:05:39,774 --> 01:05:41,576
Any time is the right time.

839
01:05:42,644 --> 01:05:45,112
I'm sure your parents
wanted grandchildren,

840
01:05:45,145 --> 01:05:46,714
all parents want grandchildren.

841
01:05:48,516 --> 01:05:51,185
My father certainly didn't,
at least not from me.

842
01:05:51,619 --> 01:05:55,422
I mean, when I told him we were
even thinking about surrogacy,

843
01:05:55,723 --> 01:05:57,357
he said we were crazy.

844
01:05:57,391 --> 01:05:58,392
That the world had gone mad

845
01:05:59,661 --> 01:06:01,228
for allowing two men to even
think about having children.

846
01:06:02,029 --> 01:06:03,197
He will change his mind

847
01:06:04,264 --> 01:06:05,733
once you'll bring him
a grandchild, believe me.

848
01:06:08,736 --> 01:06:10,037
I'm not so sure about that.

849
01:06:11,038 --> 01:06:11,639
Why not?

850
01:06:16,043 --> 01:06:18,345
Well, the truth is,

851
01:06:18,580 --> 01:06:20,582
we did try, my husband and I.

852
01:06:21,281 --> 01:06:23,050
Quite recently, in fact.

853
01:06:23,083 --> 01:06:24,218
We...

854
01:06:24,786 --> 01:06:26,220
we found a wonderful surrogate,

855
01:06:26,253 --> 01:06:28,455
she got pregnant
almost immediately.

856
01:06:29,691 --> 01:06:32,760
And everything went
really, really well.

857
01:06:34,461 --> 01:06:36,698
We were so happy waiting,
you remember what that's like.

858
01:06:36,731 --> 01:06:40,033
All the preparations, we...

859
01:06:40,067 --> 01:06:42,737
we turned the guest room
into a nursery and...

860
01:06:43,538 --> 01:06:45,573
And then six months ago,

861
01:06:46,273 --> 01:06:48,776
we made it
to the delivery room and...

862
01:06:49,476 --> 01:06:50,745
And things went...

863
01:06:51,478 --> 01:06:52,780
Well, not so good.

864
01:06:54,181 --> 01:06:56,049
We lost our baby.

865
01:06:58,385 --> 01:06:59,554
Oh.

866
01:07:01,789 --> 01:07:03,323
My father, he...

867
01:07:03,558 --> 01:07:07,227
He came to the hospital
and he didn't say a thing to me.

868
01:07:07,261 --> 01:07:09,096
Didn't hug me or anything,

869
01:07:09,129 --> 01:07:11,465
he just stood there with
this look on his face, like:

870
01:07:11,498 --> 01:07:13,233
"See? See, I told you so."

871
01:07:18,305 --> 01:07:19,439
Oh my god,

872
01:07:20,340 --> 01:07:21,709
I'm so sorry, I...

873
01:07:22,777 --> 01:07:24,546
didn't mean to spoil the dinner.

874
01:07:27,882 --> 01:07:29,684
It's not as if
I actually knew her,

875
01:07:29,717 --> 01:07:32,152
she was, you know,
she was just a newborn.

876
01:07:33,287 --> 01:07:35,557
We never even really had
a chance to bond with her,

877
01:07:35,590 --> 01:07:37,224
just the idea of her.

878
01:07:39,126 --> 01:07:40,360
In any case,

879
01:07:40,394 --> 01:07:42,162
we've put it behind us now.

880
01:07:54,174 --> 01:07:55,643
What name did you give her?

881
01:07:58,478 --> 01:07:59,847
We named her Sarah,

882
01:08:00,414 --> 01:08:02,215
after my mother.

883
01:08:14,394 --> 01:08:16,330
I'm really so sorry, I...

884
01:08:17,164 --> 01:08:18,733
certainly hadn't planned on...

885
01:08:20,668 --> 01:08:21,468
I'm sorry.

886
01:08:21,903 --> 01:08:23,170
No, no.

887
01:08:23,571 --> 01:08:25,673
It's I who am sorry.

888
01:08:25,707 --> 01:08:27,474
Very, very sorry.

889
01:09:42,550 --> 01:09:44,484
Home sweet home.

890
01:10:27,562 --> 01:10:29,630
So, did you finish packing?

891
01:10:34,367 --> 01:10:35,970
What the fuck?

892
01:10:36,971 --> 01:10:39,741
I can't in good conscience
leave you with a closet

893
01:10:39,974 --> 01:10:42,342
that looks like it's been
ransacked by baboons.

894
01:10:42,510 --> 01:10:43,578
But that's how I like it.

895
01:10:43,878 --> 01:10:46,047
No, that's how you think
you like it.

896
01:10:46,080 --> 01:10:48,348
Why not just give my way a try?

897
01:10:48,381 --> 01:10:50,985
You may surprise yourself
and find out you prefer it.

898
01:10:51,586 --> 01:10:53,821
And if you don't, no need to
worry,

899
01:10:53,855 --> 01:10:55,823
I guarantee you
the baboons will return.

900
01:10:56,090 --> 01:10:58,059
How am I supposed to find
anything?

901
01:10:58,092 --> 01:11:00,695
It's very easy, I'm gonna show
you.

902
01:11:01,461 --> 01:11:02,697
Your nice shirts,

903
01:11:02,997 --> 01:11:05,032
all two of them, are right here.

904
01:11:05,633 --> 01:11:08,970
Your t-shirts all folded
and arranged by color

905
01:11:09,402 --> 01:11:10,538
are up there.

906
01:11:11,005 --> 01:11:13,340
Your jeans, sweaters,

907
01:11:13,775 --> 01:11:16,343
sweatshirts, sweatpants

908
01:11:16,376 --> 01:11:17,444
are there.

909
01:11:17,712 --> 01:11:20,047
Your shoes are down on the
floor,

910
01:11:20,081 --> 01:11:22,717
your sneakers, your flip-flops.

911
01:11:22,750 --> 01:11:25,086
Your underwear is in this drawer

912
01:11:25,119 --> 01:11:27,054
and your socks are here.

913
01:11:27,088 --> 01:11:29,757
But we have a bit of a problem
with your socks.

914
01:11:29,791 --> 01:11:31,626
Come here,
give me a hand with this,

915
01:11:32,392 --> 01:11:34,762
we have some serious
matchmaking to do.

916
01:11:35,395 --> 01:11:38,900
And please, no projecting your
crippling fear of relationships

917
01:11:38,933 --> 01:11:40,935
onto these poor, defenseless
socks.

918
01:11:41,468 --> 01:11:43,671
Socks, in case you didn't know,

919
01:11:43,871 --> 01:11:44,972
are monogamous.

920
01:11:45,372 --> 01:11:46,406
They're like swans.

921
01:11:53,147 --> 01:11:54,347
Wait...

922
01:11:54,649 --> 01:11:56,483
What are you doing, what...

923
01:11:56,517 --> 01:11:59,887
You're murdering them,
don't roll them into a ball like that,

924
01:11:59,921 --> 01:12:02,056
it makes them lose their
elasticity.

925
01:12:02,455 --> 01:12:03,558
Here, you...

926
01:12:04,659 --> 01:12:06,794
You just wanna put them
right on top of each other,

927
01:12:06,828 --> 01:12:08,495
look, I'll show you with this.

928
01:12:08,896 --> 01:12:10,430
You just lay

929
01:12:11,431 --> 01:12:13,067
one right on top of the other

930
01:12:13,868 --> 01:12:15,970
and then you ever so gently

931
01:12:16,838 --> 01:12:18,706
just bring them together.

932
01:12:20,541 --> 01:12:21,576
Like a perfect square.

933
01:12:22,543 --> 01:12:23,110
You're crazy.

934
01:12:35,422 --> 01:12:36,524
Excuse me, sir,

935
01:12:36,724 --> 01:12:38,092
have you seen my partner?

936
01:12:38,125 --> 01:12:39,060
Looks just like me,

937
01:12:39,727 --> 01:12:41,596
blue with white stars.

938
01:12:45,666 --> 01:12:47,702
Um, no, I haven't seen him.

939
01:12:49,203 --> 01:12:50,470
Well,

940
01:12:51,471 --> 01:12:53,473
looks like we're the only
single socks left.

941
01:12:54,108 --> 01:12:55,776
I lost my mate too.

942
01:12:58,445 --> 01:12:59,747
Hey, I got an idea.

943
01:13:00,648 --> 01:13:02,083
Why don't we pair up?

944
01:13:03,117 --> 01:13:04,518
No way!

945
01:13:04,552 --> 01:13:05,887
You want me,

946
01:13:06,453 --> 01:13:08,122
a blue sock with white stars,

947
01:13:08,155 --> 01:13:10,958
to pair up with you,
a simple yellow sock?

948
01:13:10,992 --> 01:13:11,859
It will never work.

949
01:13:12,492 --> 01:13:14,996
Well, excuse me, geesh.

950
01:13:15,196 --> 01:13:17,098
Here I thought a young, hip,

951
01:13:17,131 --> 01:13:19,700
blue sock with white stars
would be open to experimenting.

952
01:13:20,835 --> 01:13:23,638
Why are you such a slave
to social conventions?

953
01:13:29,210 --> 01:13:30,811
- Wait.
- What?

954
01:13:31,178 --> 01:13:32,546
This song,

955
01:13:32,580 --> 01:13:34,447
you have to hear this song,
wait.

956
01:16:37,298 --> 01:16:39,900
May I ask Monsieur
to move to the balcony?

957
01:16:39,934 --> 01:16:42,369
The best breakfast in Tel Aviv
is now being served.

958
01:16:46,740 --> 01:16:47,875
Ichs.

959
01:16:48,809 --> 01:16:49,376
What?

960
01:16:50,010 --> 01:16:51,078
I thought you hated onion.

961
01:16:52,279 --> 01:16:54,048
Of course I do, but you love it.

962
01:16:55,116 --> 01:16:56,951
Oh, would you care for
some bread I just baked,

963
01:16:56,984 --> 01:16:58,185
I mean, bought?

964
01:17:00,421 --> 01:17:04,859
This looks just like the challah
my grandfather used to throw at us

965
01:17:04,892 --> 01:17:06,360
every Friday before Shabbat.

966
01:17:07,761 --> 01:17:08,896
Why did he do that?

967
01:17:08,929 --> 01:17:09,897
Who knows,

968
01:17:10,865 --> 01:17:12,199
but basically instead
of slicing the bread

969
01:17:12,233 --> 01:17:13,767
he'd just tear pieces off of it

970
01:17:13,801 --> 01:17:16,837
and throw it at anyone
who wanted some.

971
01:17:16,871 --> 01:17:20,941
I always thought of it like some
old-fashioned religious custom, you know.

972
01:17:20,975 --> 01:17:22,009
The breaking of the bread.

973
01:17:22,943 --> 01:17:24,111
We didn't do those things
in the kibbutz.

974
01:17:27,214 --> 01:17:29,884
I have to ask my father
what it meant when I call him,

975
01:17:30,851 --> 01:17:32,219
tell him I was back in Israel.

976
01:17:52,206 --> 01:17:53,974
Alright, alright...

977
01:17:54,008 --> 01:17:55,009
No, no...

978
01:18:01,215 --> 01:18:02,349
What?

979
01:18:05,386 --> 01:18:07,254
Look at this picture.

980
01:18:07,288 --> 01:18:08,322
- What's happening?
- It's a pigeon, but look,

981
01:18:09,256 --> 01:18:11,058
look what's going on
behind the pigeon...

982
01:18:11,091 --> 01:18:13,127
Are those two people having sex?

983
01:18:13,160 --> 01:18:15,196
- Yes.
- Wow.

984
01:18:18,065 --> 01:18:21,202
Look at that, is it real?

985
01:18:56,971 --> 01:18:58,973
You'll tell me
when it's online, right?

986
01:18:59,006 --> 01:19:00,140
I mean, the article.

987
01:19:00,341 --> 01:19:02,309
- I will.
- 'Cause I really wanna read it.

988
01:19:02,343 --> 01:19:03,410
Okay.

989
01:19:07,081 --> 01:19:08,182
And you know what?

990
01:19:08,882 --> 01:19:10,017
What?

991
01:19:10,050 --> 01:19:11,919
I think you should write
another book.

992
01:19:12,453 --> 01:19:13,821
Call it:

993
01:19:14,288 --> 01:19:15,823
"The Nightmare Bar-Mitzvah,"

994
01:19:16,991 --> 01:19:18,792
and then I'll buy the rights
and make a great movie,

995
01:19:18,826 --> 01:19:21,228
which, of course,
will be better than your book.

996
01:19:21,262 --> 01:19:24,898
Which will be good too, but you
know, just not as good as the movie.

997
01:19:25,966 --> 01:19:27,301
And then I'll win an Oscar.

998
01:19:28,670 --> 01:19:30,237
Yeah... And I'll probably share
it with you, you know, 'cause...

999
01:19:30,904 --> 01:19:32,039
I'm nice.

1000
01:19:33,207 --> 01:19:36,076
Well, I would like that very
much.

1001
01:19:36,110 --> 01:19:37,911
Oscars or no Oscars.

1002
01:19:55,597 --> 01:19:56,463
I think you should try again.

1003
01:19:57,632 --> 01:19:58,566
Huh?

1004
01:19:59,668 --> 01:20:01,001
I think you should try again,
I agree with my mom.

1005
01:20:01,869 --> 01:20:03,304
I don't think
it's too late for you.

1006
01:20:04,606 --> 01:20:05,873
Wow,

1007
01:20:06,907 --> 01:20:08,375
I thought you didn't believe
in happy endings.

1008
01:20:09,343 --> 01:20:11,011
It has nothing to do
with happy endings,

1009
01:20:11,045 --> 01:20:13,548
I just think
you'll be a good father,

1010
01:20:14,081 --> 01:20:15,182
that's all.

1011
01:20:29,096 --> 01:20:30,431
Well, Tomer,

1012
01:20:30,898 --> 01:20:32,333
I really should get going.

1013
01:20:33,267 --> 01:20:35,169
But thank you for everything.

1014
01:20:35,570 --> 01:20:37,137
You'll be in touch, right?

1015
01:20:37,171 --> 01:20:38,238
About the article and...

1016
01:20:38,272 --> 01:20:39,541
Of course, of course I will.

1017
01:20:49,350 --> 01:20:50,451
Oh...

1018
01:20:51,519 --> 01:20:52,886
Hey,

1019
01:20:55,189 --> 01:20:56,524
it's okay.

1020
01:20:59,059 --> 01:21:00,394
It's okay, Tomer.

1021
01:21:02,564 --> 01:21:04,264
Everything is gonna be okay.

1022
01:21:08,936 --> 01:21:10,170
Oh my god,

1023
01:21:11,506 --> 01:21:14,274
I can't believe I'm crying at the
airport, it's so fucking gay.

1024
01:21:16,578 --> 01:21:18,178
Go, go, just...

1025
01:21:18,546 --> 01:21:21,014
Just go, I'm okay.
I'm okay.

1026
01:22:35,155 --> 01:22:36,290
Hey, it's me.

1027
01:22:37,157 --> 01:22:38,425
I'm on the plane,

1028
01:22:38,459 --> 01:22:40,528
it's a little too early
to call, so...

1029
01:22:41,295 --> 01:22:44,064
If all goes well I'll be home
around five this afternoon.

1030
01:22:45,332 --> 01:22:48,068
I was thinking maybe we could go
to Stone Park for dinner,

1031
01:22:48,803 --> 01:22:50,605
we haven't done that
in a long time.

1032
01:22:52,306 --> 01:22:54,341
Anyhow, I will see you soon.

1033
