She's the one
who ripped the book.

543
00:32:38,157 --> 00:32:41,230
Andrew,
it takes repetition
and reinforcement--

544
00:32:41,230 --> 00:32:42,561
reinforcement
and repetition

545
00:32:42,561 --> 00:32:44,663
and reinforcement
and repetition.
I know.

546
00:32:44,663 --> 00:32:46,065
That's enough, Andrew.

547
00:32:52,271 --> 00:32:54,303
Well...

548
00:32:54,303 --> 00:32:57,546
At least somebody
is learning something
around here.

549
00:32:57,546 --> 00:32:58,547
What did he say?

550
00:32:58,547 --> 00:33:00,449
Ah.

551
00:33:00,449 --> 00:33:03,412
Your son
doesn't like you
very much, doctor.

552
00:33:03,412 --> 00:33:05,114
Hi, there.

553
00:33:16,725 --> 00:33:18,427
Look, Andrew,

554
00:33:18,427 --> 00:33:21,100
I never planned
on raising a chimpanzee.

555
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:23,772
Your mother certainly
never dreamed of it,

556
00:33:23,772 --> 00:33:26,675
but we need
Dr. Prentiss' help now.

557
00:33:29,338 --> 00:33:30,739
Wouldn't it make
jennie's life richer

558
00:33:30,739 --> 00:33:34,113
if she could speak to US?
If we could speak to her?

559
00:33:34,113 --> 00:33:36,045
That's what Dr. Prentiss
is trying to do.

560
00:33:36,045 --> 00:33:38,587
Jennie's
not an experiment,

561
00:33:38,587 --> 00:33:41,250
and that's all
she is to Dr. Prentiss.

562
00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:46,195
Do you have any idea
the stature Dr. Prentiss has--

563
00:33:46,195 --> 00:33:47,296
I mean, as a scientist?

564
00:33:47,296 --> 00:33:51,930

15 years of fieldwork.

at Harvard and Cambridge.

Just like you.

567
00:33:55,934 --> 00:33:58,537
What is that
supposed to mean?

568
00:33:58,537 --> 00:34:01,140
Your work is more
important to you

569
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:02,411
than anything else
in the world,

570
00:34:02,411 --> 00:34:04,413
even your family.

571
00:34:07,646 --> 00:34:11,350
Is that what you think?

572
00:34:11,350 --> 00:34:14,623
You say you love US,
but you always leave.

573
00:34:20,459 --> 00:34:23,332
Well, I'm not gonna waste
my time talkin' to somebody

574
00:34:23,332 --> 00:34:25,334
who's obviously not
mature enough to listen.

at my table

and use words that
I don't understand,

591
00:35:43,442 --> 00:35:44,543
and I will
sit there,

592
00:35:44,543 --> 00:35:46,845
smiling
pleasantly back
all evening.

593
00:35:46,845 --> 00:35:48,917
Do you think
I'm looking forward
to that?

594
00:35:48,917 --> 00:35:51,580
Huh? I think not.

595
00:35:57,155 --> 00:36:00,559

for animosity here.

is impossible.

as "undisciplined."

Jennie is loved
and cared for
in our home,

703
00:41:49,037 --> 00:41:50,508
a piece of data which you
conveniently overlook.

704
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:53,542
Dr. Archibald, jennie's
worth to science

705
00:41:53,542 --> 00:41:55,714
far outweighs
any personal feelings

706
00:41:55,714 --> 00:41:58,316
that you or your family
might have for her,

707
00:41:58,316 --> 00:42:00,549
and you know
that no chimpanzee

708
00:42:00,549 --> 00:42:03,792
has ever lived with
a surrogate human family

709
00:42:03,792 --> 00:42:05,523
past the age
of adulthood,

710
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:09,127
an age which jennie
is rapidly approaching.

711
00:42:09,127 --> 00:42:12,801
Jennie is probably
the smartest,
brightest chimpanzee

712
00:42:12,801 --> 00:42:14,032
I have ever worked with.

in the dust.

Dr. Archibald,

715
00:42:19,407 --> 00:42:22,240
the tahachee center
would be willing
to pay you

716
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:24,713
a substantial
amount of money
for jennie.

717
00:42:24,713 --> 00:42:28,416
I've been authorized
to offer you
$70,000 for her.

As per our agreement,
Dr. Prentiss,

at our home.

If this situation
is no longer
suitable for you,

721
00:42:35,083 --> 00:42:36,625
then your project
with her is over.

722
00:42:36,625 --> 00:42:40,328
Thank you, Walter.

723
00:42:50,939 --> 00:42:52,100
Hugo.

724
00:42:54,402 --> 00:42:56,174
We've been friends
for a long time.

725
00:42:56,174 --> 00:42:58,376
That aside,
I think you're one

726
00:42:58,376 --> 00:43:01,880
of the most
brilliant scientists
I've ever known.

727
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:03,782
What are you
getting at, Walter?

728
00:43:03,782 --> 00:43:07,155
Usually,
an animal imprints

729
00:43:07,155 --> 00:43:09,217
with the first
living soul it sees.

730
00:43:09,217 --> 00:43:11,119
Jennie imprinted
you as her father.

731
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:13,421
She imprinted
your family
as her family.

732
00:43:13,421 --> 00:43:15,063
You've raised
a chimpanzee

733
00:43:15,063 --> 00:43:17,325
that thinks
she's human,

734
00:43:17,325 --> 00:43:19,567
but there's
a danger...

735
00:43:19,567 --> 00:43:22,000
That the imprinting
can go both ways.

736
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,271
[Laughs]
What, do you think

737
00:43:23,271 --> 00:43:25,033
I think jennie
is my daughter?

738
00:43:25,033 --> 00:43:28,837
I'm speaking
to you colleague
to colleague, Hugo.

739
00:43:28,837 --> 00:43:31,940
Now, you're trying
to secure funding
for a project

740
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:33,611
that could be
the most
important work

741
00:43:33,611 --> 00:43:36,645
in natural history
in decades.

742
00:43:36,645 --> 00:43:40,518
Do you really want
to have a feud going
with Dr. Prentiss,

743
00:43:40,518 --> 00:43:41,850
one of
the preeminent

744
00:43:41,850 --> 00:43:44,052
primatologists
in the world?

745
00:43:44,052 --> 00:43:46,554
A cage is a cage, Walter.

746
00:43:46,554 --> 00:43:48,897
Jennie doesn't belong
in a cage.

747
00:43:54,332 --> 00:43:58,606
[Sighs]

748
00:43:58,606 --> 00:44:00,939
Leah: Oh, here's
one bag for you.

749
00:44:00,939 --> 00:44:02,170
Anything good?

750
00:44:02,170 --> 00:44:04,242
Lots of refined sugar.

751
00:44:05,543 --> 00:44:06,875
[Screeches]
Oh!

752
00:44:06,875 --> 00:44:10,278
[Screeches]
Andrew.

753
00:44:10,278 --> 00:44:11,279
Get her
out of there.

754
00:44:11,279 --> 00:44:12,721
What? Whoa!

755
00:44:13,551 --> 00:44:14,753
Sarah: Jennie.

756
00:44:14,753 --> 00:44:16,554
Hey, jennie.
Stop. Stop.

757
00:44:16,554 --> 00:44:17,756
Leah: Andrew, please.

758
00:44:17,756 --> 00:44:19,457
Leah: Jennie.
Get down.

759
00:44:19,457 --> 00:44:20,658
Jennie.
Get down.

760
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:22,260
Jennie.

761
00:44:23,962 --> 00:44:25,093
Leah: I don't know.

762
00:44:25,093 --> 00:44:27,696
Get down, jennie.
Stop. Jennie.

763
00:44:27,696 --> 00:44:29,597
Sarah: Come on, jennie.
Be a good girl.

764
00:44:29,597 --> 00:44:31,269
Give me those back.
Sarah: No!

765
00:44:31,269 --> 00:44:33,041
Jennie.
Not the marshmallows!

766
00:44:33,041 --> 00:44:35,904
Jennie, come back
down here, please.

767
00:44:35,904 --> 00:44:39,077
Sarah: Jennie, stop.
Jennie.

768
00:44:39,077 --> 00:44:41,179
Andrew: Stop.
Jennie, come back.

769
00:44:42,781 --> 00:44:46,855
[Dog barks]

770
00:44:46,855 --> 00:44:49,087
Hello. Anybody home?

771
00:44:51,860 --> 00:44:55,163
Dr. Archibald?

772
00:44:55,163 --> 00:44:56,725
[Knocks]

773
00:44:58,396 --> 00:45:00,769
[Dog barks]

774
00:45:00,769 --> 00:45:02,831
Man on TV: Has been nothing
short of very violent.

775
00:45:02,831 --> 00:45:04,903
We've received
so many applications...

776
00:45:06,034 --> 00:45:08,877
Oh! Hey, Archibald.

777
00:45:08,877 --> 00:45:10,108
Hey, frank.

778
00:45:10,108 --> 00:45:11,910
Your old man around?

779
00:45:11,910 --> 00:45:13,341
No.

780
00:45:13,341 --> 00:45:16,114
What about the, uh,
the--the--the chimp?

781
00:45:16,114 --> 00:45:19,117
You don't have to worry.
Jennie's with Dr. Prentiss.

782
00:45:19,117 --> 00:45:21,619
I think this might be
the letter your dad's
been waitin' for.

783
00:45:21,619 --> 00:45:23,952
It looks
sort of important.

784
00:45:26,224 --> 00:45:29,627
It must be tough
growin' up without
your dad around.

785
00:45:29,627 --> 00:45:31,729
You know, Archibald,

786
00:45:31,729 --> 00:45:33,631
you hang around
that chimp so much,

787
00:45:33,631 --> 00:45:36,704
I can't help but notice,
but you're startin' to look
a little bit like her.

788
00:45:36,704 --> 00:45:38,066
Don't you think
it might be time

789
00:45:38,066 --> 00:45:40,538
you started to hang with
some of your own species?

790
00:45:40,538 --> 00:45:42,110
People are talkin'.

791
00:45:42,110 --> 00:45:44,112
Thanks for the info,
frank.

792
00:45:44,112 --> 00:45:47,115
Just lookin' out
for ya, Archibald.

793
00:45:59,828 --> 00:46:00,829
Any mail for me?

794
00:46:00,829 --> 00:46:04,933
Um, uh, no. Nothin'.

795
00:46:07,635 --> 00:46:08,967
Tell mom
I'll be workin' late.

796
00:46:08,967 --> 00:46:11,199
Uh, sure thing.

797
00:46:18,807 --> 00:46:20,348
Andrew: When dad
went to Africa,

798
00:46:20,348 --> 00:46:21,609
he told me to look

799
00:46:21,609 --> 00:46:24,312
at the brightest star
in the sky and think of him,

800
00:46:24,312 --> 00:46:26,254
and then he'd do
the same for me,

801
00:46:26,254 --> 00:46:28,156
and that way,
we'd always be together.

802
00:46:28,156 --> 00:46:30,118
I was just
a little kid then,

803
00:46:30,118 --> 00:46:31,920
and I believed
that kind of stuff.

804
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:35,063
I don't feel much
like a little kid anymore.

805
00:46:38,396 --> 00:46:41,099
Dad's letter came today.

806
00:46:41,099 --> 00:46:44,632
He got the funding
to go back to Africa.

807
00:46:44,632 --> 00:46:49,077
He'll probably be gone
for another 8 months.

808
00:46:49,077 --> 00:46:52,380
Sometimes, when he's away,
I forget what he looks like,

809
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:54,142
and I forget
what he sounds like.

810
00:47:12,861 --> 00:47:16,564
Yes. A letter bad.

811
00:47:16,564 --> 00:47:18,066
I want you to know

812
00:47:18,066 --> 00:47:20,138
I called the veteran's
administration.

813
00:47:20,138 --> 00:47:21,709
They mailed it Thursday.

814
00:47:21,709 --> 00:47:24,312
First Thursday of the month
like they do every month.

815
00:47:24,312 --> 00:47:26,674
Yeah. If it says
"Mr. Elton crabb" on it,

816
00:47:26,674 --> 00:47:28,216
I put it
in your mailbox.

817
00:47:28,216 --> 00:47:30,448
Don't you get sassy
with me, mail boy.

818
00:47:30,448 --> 00:47:33,451
I want you to know
I stormed the beaches
at normandy.

819
00:47:33,451 --> 00:47:35,423
Just keep livin'
in the past, old man.

820
00:47:35,423 --> 00:47:36,484
[Horn honks]
I heard that.

821
00:47:36,484 --> 00:47:39,257
Frank, they shut
my phone off last week

822
00:47:39,257 --> 00:47:41,189
because I didn't
receive my bill on time.

823
00:47:41,189 --> 00:47:42,590
I'm sorry.
I have no idea--

824
00:47:42,590 --> 00:47:43,791
woman: Frank?
Yes?

825
00:47:43,791 --> 00:47:45,033
Where are
my catalogs, frank?

826
00:47:45,033 --> 00:47:46,594
Are you
reading my catalogs?

827
00:47:46,594 --> 00:47:48,336
I don't read catalogs,
Mrs. Babbit.

828
00:47:48,336 --> 00:47:49,837
I hate catalogs.
I really do.

829
00:47:49,837 --> 00:47:51,970
I want you to know,
frank Russo,

830
00:47:51,970 --> 00:47:54,742
I lodged a complaint
with the postmaster.

831
00:47:54,742 --> 00:47:58,446
Right. Ok, everybody
just take a deep breath
and calm down.

832
00:47:58,446 --> 00:47:59,607
You mean--

833
00:47:59,607 --> 00:48:01,079
they're gonna
cut off my cable--

834
00:48:01,079 --> 00:48:02,680
I want my mail!

835
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:07,315
Quiet! Quiet.
Ooh, ooh, ok.

836
00:48:07,315 --> 00:48:11,519
All right.
Obviously, something
has seriously gone wrong.

837
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:14,162
I promise all of you
that I'll get
to the bottom of this.

838
00:48:14,162 --> 00:48:16,494
I will find your mail.

839
00:48:16,494 --> 00:48:19,167
Sir, ladies, excuse me.

840
00:48:19,167 --> 00:48:20,929
Good-bye.
No, I'm over here.

841
00:48:20,929 --> 00:48:23,131
I mean, I read things
that come in the mail.

842
00:48:23,131 --> 00:48:24,372
Frank: It looks like
it might rain.
Frank.

843
00:48:24,372 --> 00:48:25,833
Frank.

844
00:48:25,833 --> 00:48:28,006
[Frank whistles]

845
00:48:31,139 --> 00:48:32,981
What the--

846
00:48:32,981 --> 00:48:34,943
whoa.

847
00:48:50,658 --> 00:48:52,500
Elton crabb.

848
00:49:05,343 --> 00:49:08,016
It's the chimp.

849
00:49:08,016 --> 00:49:09,547
Ooh.

850
00:49:30,938 --> 00:49:34,472

851
00:49:36,244 --> 00:49:39,207

Easy there, bonzo.

859
00:49:58,466 --> 00:50:00,468
No one needs to get
hurt over this.

No one messes
with the u.S. Mail.

00:50:06,374 --> 00:50:07,535
Frank, no.

864
00:50:07,535 --> 00:50:09,177
Run, jennie.

865
00:50:10,478 --> 00:50:13,010
Ow!
Why don't you pick
on someone your own size?

866
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:15,743
Ooh. Ooh.
That's it, Archibald.

867
00:50:15,743 --> 00:50:18,686
Your chimp is done for.
I'm filing charges.

880
00:50:50,548 --> 00:50:53,681
Hit the left--the brakes.

I want my truck!

Jennie, it's ok!
Aah!
[Cries]

898
00:51:49,807 --> 00:51:52,740
Oh! Oh, what am
I gonna tell
my supervisor?

899
00:51:52,740 --> 00:51:55,243
Oh! Oh,
look at this!

900
00:51:55,243 --> 00:51:56,784
Woman on P.A.: Dr. Abel...

901
00:51:58,986 --> 00:52:00,988
Hello, can I get some help?

902
00:52:00,988 --> 00:52:02,190
What do we have here?

903
00:52:02,190 --> 00:52:04,892
Uh, dislocation, contusion,
possible fracture.

904
00:52:04,892 --> 00:52:06,194
Oh, are you a doctor?

905
00:52:06,194 --> 00:52:08,456
Uh, ph.D.
Hugo Archibald.

906
00:52:08,456 --> 00:52:09,957
Patient's name?

907
00:52:09,957 --> 00:52:11,599
Jennie Archibald.

908
00:52:11,599 --> 00:52:13,231
Let's take a look.

909
00:52:15,132 --> 00:52:16,734
[Coos]
[Gasps]

910
00:52:17,935 --> 00:52:20,007
Is this some kind
of a joke?

911
00:52:20,007 --> 00:52:21,269
I'm sorry?

912
00:52:21,269 --> 00:52:23,671
Get this animal
out of here.

913
00:52:23,671 --> 00:52:25,713
This is a hospital
for humans only,

914
00:52:25,713 --> 00:52:26,844
in case
you haven't noticed.

915
00:52:26,844 --> 00:52:28,316
Woman on P.A.:
Residents, op one.

916
00:52:28,316 --> 00:52:30,548
Surgical residents,
op one.

917
00:52:30,548 --> 00:52:32,180
Here. Put jennie over there.
I'll be right back.

918
00:52:32,180 --> 00:52:33,181
Dad, maybe we should--

919
00:52:33,181 --> 00:52:34,682
Hugo: This is outrageous!

920
00:52:36,724 --> 00:52:38,726
Hey. Hey.

921
00:52:38,726 --> 00:52:40,258
You mean, you're gonna
refuse her admission?

922
00:52:40,258 --> 00:52:41,259
Yes.

923
00:52:41,259 --> 00:52:42,560
What's your name?

924
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:43,731
I'm taking down your name.

925
00:52:43,731 --> 00:52:44,962
If you don't remove
her immediately,

926
00:52:44,962 --> 00:52:46,564
I'm calling security.

927
00:52:46,564 --> 00:52:49,267
Oh, Jen.
Sit down right here.

928
00:52:49,267 --> 00:52:52,670
[Coos]
Is that good? Right.

929
00:52:52,670 --> 00:52:55,303
[Whimpers]
Ok.

930
00:52:59,277 --> 00:53:03,611
Andrew love jennie.

931
00:53:03,611 --> 00:53:06,454
It's gonna be ok, Jen.

932
00:53:14,021 --> 00:53:16,494
Her name...

933
00:53:16,494 --> 00:53:21,198
Is j-e-n-n-i-e.
Jennie.

934
00:53:23,170 --> 00:53:26,904
Andrew: Don't worry, jennie.
Feel better soon.

935
00:53:31,439 --> 00:53:33,581
Please. Can't you see
she's hurt?

936
00:53:37,745 --> 00:53:39,687
Nurse: She understands
sign language?

937
00:53:39,687 --> 00:53:42,250
Nearly 100 words.

938
00:53:42,250 --> 00:53:44,592
May I please see
the attending physician?

939
00:53:48,125 --> 00:53:50,428
I'll get him.

940
00:53:50,428 --> 00:53:52,930
[Sighs]

941
00:53:55,663 --> 00:53:56,664
How is she?

942
00:53:56,664 --> 00:53:59,407
[Sighs]
She's gonna be fine.

943
00:53:59,407 --> 00:54:00,908
It's just
a minor fracture.

944
00:54:00,908 --> 00:54:02,139
She'll have
to wear a soft cast

945
00:54:02,139 --> 00:54:04,241
for a couple
of weeks.

946
00:54:04,241 --> 00:54:05,613
They say
she'll be back

947
00:54:05,613 --> 00:54:07,275
to her old self
in no time.

948
00:54:09,377 --> 00:54:10,648
You sure
you're all right?

949
00:54:10,648 --> 00:54:13,451
Yeah. You?

950
00:54:13,451 --> 00:54:15,783
She almost
ran me over.

951
00:54:15,783 --> 00:54:18,225
[Both laugh]

952
00:54:18,225 --> 00:54:20,828
[Coos]

953
00:54:20,828 --> 00:54:22,960
I think
this little girl
belongs to you.

954
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:26,063
Jennie. Hey.

955
00:54:26,063 --> 00:54:29,397
Ooh! Look at that.
Look at that, huh?

956
00:54:29,397 --> 00:54:31,469
Andrew: Thank you.

957
00:54:31,469 --> 00:54:32,940
Thanks.

958
00:54:32,940 --> 00:54:34,742
All right.
Let's get outta here.

959
00:54:36,273 --> 00:54:38,306
[Gavel bangs]
Bailiff: Next case.

960
00:54:38,306 --> 00:54:42,650
The matter of frank Russo
versus jennie Archibald.

961
00:54:42,650 --> 00:54:46,113
That's me.
Ooh!

962
00:54:47,214 --> 00:54:50,358
Ooh. Ooh. Ooh. Ooh.

963
00:54:50,358 --> 00:54:52,019
And you are
the plaintiff?

964
00:54:52,019 --> 00:54:55,593
Uh, yes, your honor.
Uh, it's an honor,
your honor.

965
00:54:55,593 --> 00:54:57,395
And the defendant?

966
00:54:57,395 --> 00:54:59,367
Uh, your honor,
uh, she's not--not--

967
00:54:59,367 --> 00:55:01,899
not--not here yet.
My husband--

968
00:55:01,899 --> 00:55:03,671
and you are?

969
00:55:03,671 --> 00:55:06,904
I'm Leah Archibald.
I'm--I'm the defendant's...

970
00:55:06,904 --> 00:55:08,406
Uh, mother.

971
00:55:08,406 --> 00:55:10,638
Well, you don't sound
too sure about that.

972
00:55:10,638 --> 00:55:14,442
Well, oh!
That's--there he is.

973
00:55:14,442 --> 00:55:15,713
I'm gonna sit.

974
00:55:18,085 --> 00:55:19,947
[Coos]

975
00:55:19,947 --> 00:55:22,450
Um, sorry, your honor.

976
00:55:22,450 --> 00:55:24,151
Um, she needed
to use the bathroom.

977
00:55:24,151 --> 00:55:26,093
[Bangs]
Order!

978
00:55:26,093 --> 00:55:27,795
Order, please.

979
00:55:27,795 --> 00:55:30,498
Why is that animal
in my courtroom?

980
00:55:30,498 --> 00:55:34,131
Uh, this is
the defendant,
jennie Archibald.

981
00:55:34,131 --> 00:55:38,105
I'll have order
or I'll clear the courtroom.

982
00:55:39,467 --> 00:55:41,268
Don't let that
face fool you,
your honor.

983
00:55:41,268 --> 00:55:43,471
This--this is
no ordinary monkey.

984
00:55:43,471 --> 00:55:45,312
Uh, she's actually
not a monkey at all,
your honor.

985
00:55:45,312 --> 00:55:46,343
She's an ape.

986
00:55:46,343 --> 00:55:48,516
All right. I'll bite.

987
00:55:48,516 --> 00:55:51,849
Read the charges
against this defendant.

988
00:55:54,121 --> 00:55:56,854
"Under county
ordinance 4019,

989
00:55:56,854 --> 00:55:59,727
"jennie Archibald,
the defendant,

990
00:55:59,727 --> 00:56:02,630
"is charged with causing
grievous bodily injury

991
00:56:02,630 --> 00:56:04,832
and being a threat
to public safety."

992
00:56:04,832 --> 00:56:07,164
She defiled
and stole mail, too.

993
00:56:07,164 --> 00:56:08,666
That's
a federal offense.

994
00:56:08,666 --> 00:56:11,038
These are serious charges.

995
00:56:11,038 --> 00:56:13,300
Under the law,
if found guilty,

996
00:56:13,300 --> 00:56:15,443
the animal would
have to be destroyed.

997
00:56:15,443 --> 00:56:18,105
Do you mind telling me
what happened?

998
00:56:18,105 --> 00:56:19,777
Uh, well, I wasn't
there, you honor,

999
00:56:19,777 --> 00:56:21,409
but perhaps
you could ask her.

1000
00:56:21,409 --> 00:56:24,181
Don't make a mockery
of my court, doctor.

1001
00:56:24,181 --> 00:56:27,785
You'll find
I get very cranky
when litigants do that.

1002
00:56:27,785 --> 00:56:29,286
I would never
do that, your honor,

1003
00:56:29,286 --> 00:56:31,659
but you see,
frank is right
about one thing.

1004
00:56:31,659 --> 00:56:34,391
Jennie is no
ordinary animal.

1005
00:56:34,391 --> 00:56:36,624
She's a very special
individual.

1006
00:56:36,624 --> 00:56:38,025
She's more
like you or me

1007
00:56:38,025 --> 00:56:40,027
than any other
creature
on this planet.

1008
00:56:40,027 --> 00:56:41,629
Believe me, I know.

1009
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:44,732
And if you'll allow it,
I'll show you

1010
00:56:44,732 --> 00:56:46,033
that jennie
is capable of answering

1011
00:56:46,033 --> 00:56:48,536
any question
put to her concerning
the charges.

1012
00:56:48,536 --> 00:56:50,738
Miss trousdale.

1013
00:56:53,380 --> 00:56:54,912
What is this?

1014
00:56:54,912 --> 00:56:57,014
Hugo: Miss trousdale
is an official

1015
00:56:57,014 --> 00:56:58,686
American sign language
interpreter

1016
00:56:58,686 --> 00:57:00,017
registered
with this very court.

1017
00:57:00,017 --> 00:57:02,349
With your permission?

1018
00:57:02,349 --> 00:57:04,091
Oh.

1019
00:57:05,923 --> 00:57:07,154
Swear her in.

1020
00:57:07,154 --> 00:57:08,656
The monkey?

1021
00:57:08,656 --> 00:57:09,657
She's an ape!

1022
00:57:09,657 --> 00:57:11,428
[Gavel bangs]

1023
00:57:12,860 --> 00:57:14,632
Just do it.

1024
00:57:19,607 --> 00:57:21,308
Place your right hand
on the Bible.

1025
00:57:21,308 --> 00:57:23,541
Swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth,

1026
00:57:23,541 --> 00:57:24,972
and nothing
but the truth.

1027
00:57:24,972 --> 00:57:27,044
[Coos]

1028
00:57:30,718 --> 00:57:32,980
Ask the monkey--
I mean ape--

1029
00:57:32,980 --> 00:57:35,182
why she attacked
the mailman.

1030
00:57:51,438 --> 00:57:53,971
She says,
"give jennie apple."

1031
00:57:53,971 --> 00:57:56,443
Hugo: Um...

1032
00:57:56,443 --> 00:57:58,275
Please let her
try again, your honor.

1033
00:57:58,275 --> 00:58:00,277
Judge nembhard:
Please be quiet, people.

1034
00:58:00,277 --> 00:58:02,780
Miss trousdale,
you want to try again?

1035
00:58:09,216 --> 00:58:11,619
[Coos]

1036
00:58:12,790 --> 00:58:15,262
Jennie.

1037
00:58:15,262 --> 00:58:20,197
Why jennie
hurt frank?

1038
00:58:20,197 --> 00:58:21,799
Please sit down,
young man.

1039
00:58:21,799 --> 00:58:24,131
Let me do the questioning,
if you don't mind.

1040
00:58:24,131 --> 00:58:26,033
Miss trousdale:
Uh, your honor,
she's speaking.

1041
00:58:26,033 --> 00:58:27,034
Judge nembhard:
What's she saying?

1042
00:58:27,034 --> 00:58:30,407
[Coos]

1043
00:58:30,407 --> 00:58:34,612
Jennie says,
"frank bad."

1044
00:58:34,612 --> 00:58:35,883
Say, I resent that.

1045
00:58:35,883 --> 00:58:37,915
Can she elaborate?

1046
00:58:40,147 --> 00:58:41,318
[Coos]

1047
00:58:41,318 --> 00:58:42,750
Miss trousdale:
I don't understand.

1048
00:58:42,750 --> 00:58:47,254
She's saying,
"frank bad.
Hurt Andrew."

1049
00:58:47,254 --> 00:58:49,426
Frank:
Oh, wait a minute.

1050
00:58:49,426 --> 00:58:51,999
What kind of chimpanzee
court is this?

1051
00:58:51,999 --> 00:58:53,861
It's the letter.

1052
00:58:53,861 --> 00:58:55,532
Andrew?

1053
00:58:55,532 --> 00:58:57,965
Judge: Dr. Archibald?

1054
00:58:57,965 --> 00:59:01,709
Your honor,
this is my son Andrew.

1055
00:59:01,709 --> 00:59:04,642
Andrew, is there something
you need to share with US?

1056
00:59:04,642 --> 00:59:06,243
Go ahead.

1057
00:59:06,243 --> 00:59:07,975
Jennie hurt frank

1058
00:59:07,975 --> 00:59:09,847
because
he delivers letters.

1059
00:59:09,847 --> 00:59:11,849
Letters?

1060
00:59:11,849 --> 00:59:14,121
Well, not--
not all letters.

1061
00:59:14,121 --> 00:59:15,623
One letter.

1062
00:59:15,623 --> 00:59:18,626
The letter that
said you were going
back to the ituri.

1063
00:59:18,626 --> 00:59:20,788
Back to Africa
to do more research.

1064
00:59:20,788 --> 00:59:23,160
I got the Grant.

1065
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:26,493
And I was so angry
when you got it,

1066
00:59:26,493 --> 00:59:29,436
I tore it up.

1067
00:59:29,436 --> 00:59:32,239
And jennie
was with me,

1068
00:59:32,239 --> 00:59:35,643
and I guess
she thought
I was mad at frank.

1069
00:59:36,473 --> 00:59:37,675
Your honor,

1070
00:59:37,675 --> 00:59:40,848
I'm Dr. Pamela prentiss.
I can handle this, Pam.

1071
00:59:40,848 --> 00:59:43,080
With all
due respect, doctor,

1072
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:44,612
I don't think you can.

1073
00:59:44,612 --> 00:59:45,813
Who is this?

1074
00:59:45,813 --> 00:59:47,454
Dr. Prentiss
is one of the most

1075
00:59:47,454 --> 00:59:49,486
celebrated primatologists
in this country.

1076
00:59:49,486 --> 00:59:51,789
She's the one
responsible for
jennie's language skills.

1077
00:59:51,789 --> 00:59:55,893
I must say, this is
quite an honor, Dr. Prentiss.

1078
00:59:55,893 --> 00:59:58,095
I've read all your books.

1079
00:59:58,095 --> 01:00:00,227
Why, thank you.

1080
01:00:00,227 --> 01:00:01,899
If the court
is interested,

1081
01:00:01,899 --> 01:00:03,831
I believe that I might
have a simple solution

1082
01:00:03,831 --> 01:00:06,233
to this somewhat
complex problem.

1083
01:00:06,233 --> 01:00:07,775
I'm all ears.

1084
01:00:07,775 --> 01:00:08,936
But, your honor, wo--

1085
01:00:08,936 --> 01:00:12,579
Mr. Russo, Dr. Archibald,
Dr. Prentiss,

1086
01:00:12,579 --> 01:00:15,082
if I may please see you
in my chambers

1087
01:00:15,082 --> 01:00:16,914
for a short recess.

1088
01:00:16,914 --> 01:00:18,786
Bailiff: All rise!
[Jennie cackles]

1089
01:00:41,909 --> 01:00:43,270
Where are the kids?

1090
01:00:43,270 --> 01:00:45,112
I took them
back to school.

1091
01:00:47,044 --> 01:00:50,147
So what did the judge say?

1092
01:00:55,452 --> 01:00:59,026
[Softly]
Oh, Hugo, no.

1093
01:01:02,189 --> 01:01:03,190
It's ok.
It's all right.

1094
01:01:03,190 --> 01:01:04,661
I mean, it's
better this way.

1095
01:01:04,661 --> 01:01:07,094
I don't think...

1096
01:01:07,094 --> 01:01:08,495
I don't think
it's fair that
you should have to

1097
01:01:08,495 --> 01:01:09,797
take care
of the kids
and jennie

1098
01:01:09,797 --> 01:01:12,339

1099
01:01:12,339 --> 01:01:15,542
while you're what?
[Sighs]

1100
01:01:17,705 --> 01:01:19,807
You're not actually
considering going back.

1101
01:01:19,807 --> 01:01:21,008
This is
important, Leah.

1102
01:01:21,008 --> 01:01:22,509
Yes, it is, Hugo.

1103
01:01:24,251 --> 01:01:26,583
Yes, it is.

1104
01:01:28,185 --> 01:01:30,017
They're going to
be devastated.

1105
01:01:30,017 --> 01:01:32,589
First jennie,
and then you.

1106
01:01:37,294 --> 01:01:40,397
We were just starting to
feel like a family again.

1107
01:02:08,195 --> 01:02:09,957
I haven't been up here

1109
01:02:12,199 --> 01:02:15,132
You did a good job.

1110
01:02:15,132 --> 01:02:17,264
It's held up well.

1111
01:02:21,168 --> 01:02:23,410
Jennie...

1112
01:02:26,413 --> 01:02:29,316
Jennie, go with Pam today.

1113

1114
01:02:30,547 --> 01:02:32,249
No.

1115

[Moans]

1117
01:02:39,486 --> 01:02:43,060
You know, a good friend
once told me that you
have a powerful deefa...

1118
01:02:44,361 --> 01:02:46,233
And I believe him.

1119
01:02:48,896 --> 01:02:50,968

1120
01:02:52,239 --> 01:02:54,601

1121
01:03:01,408 --> 01:03:02,749
Jennie?

1122
01:03:04,051 --> 01:03:08,255
Ah. Ahh.

1123
01:03:08,255 --> 01:03:10,587
Hi, there.
How are you?

1124
01:03:13,260 --> 01:03:15,262
She's as strong
as 7 men, doctor.

1125
01:03:15,262 --> 01:03:18,465
What's she
going to be like
in a year or 2?

1126
01:03:20,427 --> 01:03:22,769
She needs a controlled,
disciplined environment.

1127
01:03:24,801 --> 01:03:26,803
She belongs
to science now.

1128
01:03:26,803 --> 01:03:29,106
We both know
it's for the best.

1129
01:03:29,106 --> 01:03:32,039
You mean, the best
for Dr. Pamela prentiss.

1130
01:03:33,040 --> 01:03:36,613
Dr. Archibald, we both
have our careers,

1131
01:03:36,613 --> 01:03:39,586
and I have dedicated
my entire life to mine.

1132
01:03:39,586 --> 01:03:42,419
And no matter what you
and your family might think,

1133
01:03:42,419 --> 01:03:45,592
I care about jennie
an awful lot.

1134

01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:23,961
Hey, kiddo.

1138
01:04:23,961 --> 01:04:26,293
Check this out.

1139
01:04:26,293 --> 01:04:28,265
That's fantastic.

1140
01:04:28,265 --> 01:04:31,338
I pulled my average
up an entire
letter grade.

1141

where's Jen?

Jennie?

1145
01:04:41,748 --> 01:04:44,781
Jen. Jennie!

Where is she?

1154
01:05:05,973 --> 01:05:07,074

best for her to

1155
01:05:07,074 --> 01:05:08,705
live at the tahachee center.

1156

report.

He's only
12 years old.

1163
01:05:35,462 --> 01:05:38,335
No, not the chimp,
my son.

1164
01:05:38,335 --> 01:05:39,406
Forget the chimp.

1165
01:05:39,406 --> 01:05:41,508

brought the chimp up.

Yes. I appreciate
that. I do.

Thank you very much.
Yes. Thank you.

1170

what he's thinking.

the police.

This is all my fault.
You can say that again.

1175
01:06:04,831 --> 01:06:06,063

a good-bye.

1254
01:12:31,047 --> 01:12:33,450
This one's a little young

1256
01:12:34,581 --> 01:12:35,782
And who is this?

Andrew: My father,
being a man of science,

1263
01:15:08,575 --> 01:15:11,077
believed in a natural
order of all things.

1264
01:15:11,077 --> 01:15:12,879
He believed that
the world is a place

1265
01:15:12,879 --> 01:15:16,583
to be comprehended,
dissected, and classified.

1266
01:15:16,583 --> 01:15:18,444
But jennie
taught him something:

1267
01:15:18,444 --> 01:15:19,515
That we see the world

1268
01:15:19,515 --> 01:15:21,087
not only
through our eyes,

1269
01:15:21,087 --> 01:15:23,820
but through our hearts.

1270
01:15:23,820 --> 01:15:26,292
It's time to go.

1271
01:15:44,611 --> 01:15:46,573
