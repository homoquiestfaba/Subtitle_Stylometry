Oh, some people
really don't care, Violet.

They don't.

6
00:01:53,514 --> 00:01:54,782
I know that.

7
00:01:54,816 --> 00:01:56,551
They just let stuff happen

- Sorry.

I'm talking about control,
Violet.

- I know.
- Carefully exercised,

meticulous control.

15
00:02:14,836 --> 00:02:16,738

Well, you...
You know what I mean.

00:02:39,827 --> 00:02:41,294
- Uh-huh.
- I think the expression

26
00:02:41,328 --> 00:02:45,733
- still applies here.
- Welcome to the Death of Comedy!

27
00:02:45,767 --> 00:02:46,801
Yeah!

So when you come
to the show with a sack

34
00:02:55,943 --> 00:02:59,346
of bottom-shelf booze
it makes a difference.

35
00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:01,214
Not just to the talent
of the show

36
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:04,284
but to the prestige
of the show itself.

37
00:03:04,317 --> 00:03:05,753
Top-shelf for now on, all right?

38
00:03:05,787 --> 00:03:08,288
I don't want us
to look like assholes.

39
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:11,526

casual, weekend racism.

Okay, alright!

searing social insight,

Uh, hi, I'm Andy Jocelyn.

00:04:02,043 --> 00:04:04,979
Um, tell you all a bit...
a little bit about myself.

54
00:04:05,012 --> 00:04:10,618
Uh, when I was 6 years old,
I was first diagnosed as a hunk.

55
00:04:10,651 --> 00:04:12,720

it's been tough ever since...

- Hey, you're Violet, right?
- Yeah.

- Hi.
- ...every girl I go home with

59
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:20,695
- has a body pillow.
- I'm from Boston.

60
00:04:20,728 --> 00:04:22,697
And why are they all named
Idris Elba?

61
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:24,866
Explain that to
me. Explain that.

62
00:04:24,899 --> 00:04:27,635
- Is this your show?
- The one you're talking through?

63
00:04:27,668 --> 00:04:30,437
- Yeah, it's my show.
- Cool.

64
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:32,339
Well, I was a uh,
regular at the Comedy Pit,

65
00:04:32,372 --> 00:04:34,542
back in Boston, and then
Dave's Douchebag of Comedy

66
00:04:34,575 --> 00:04:36,611
- I did a few times, so...
- That's really... okay just...

67
00:04:36,644 --> 00:04:38,478
yeah, you can message
the show page

68
00:04:38,513 --> 00:04:40,615
and I'll throw you up
if we have a spot for you.

69
00:04:40,648 --> 00:04:43,050
- Awesome, thank you, um.
- That was all I could remember.

70
00:04:43,084 --> 00:04:45,418
Oh, no, hold on.
This is true.

71
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:47,722
I was uh, I was driving home
last night

72
00:04:47,755 --> 00:04:51,391
and uh, I went through
a DUI checkpoint, totally sober.

73
00:04:51,424 --> 00:04:52,660
Have you ever done this?

74
00:04:52,693 --> 00:04:54,829
Oh my God,
it's the greatest feeling.

75
00:04:54,862 --> 00:04:57,632
I've never been
so confident in my life.

76
00:04:57,665 --> 00:04:59,332
I've never been so confident.

77
00:04:59,366 --> 00:05:00,735
I'm like, "Oh yeah,
I'm turning the radio up.

78
00:05:00,768 --> 00:05:03,037
You'll have to ask
for me to turn it down."

79
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:04,437
Wait, can you get...
I was wearing a Polo.

80
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:06,007
So you book Too Late, right?

81
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,643
And he pulled me out
of the car in a Polo shirt.

82
00:05:08,676 --> 00:05:12,880
- No, I don't book Too Late.
- Aren't you... you're Bob Devore's

83
00:05:12,914 --> 00:05:14,982
- assistant, right?
- Sorry what was it? Dax?

84
00:05:15,016 --> 00:05:17,084
- Yeah, that's it.
- Yeah, I am Bob's assistant,

85
00:05:17,118 --> 00:05:19,654
but I don't book that show.
I've never booked that show.

86
00:05:19,687 --> 00:05:21,122
No one will ever book
the show other than Bob,

87
00:05:21,155 --> 00:05:22,623
because according to him,
basically

88
00:05:22,657 --> 00:05:25,760
nobody's good enough to do it.
Okay?

89
00:05:25,793 --> 00:05:27,895

how things worked at whatever

90

you know, piss-stained wing hut
you came up in,

91
00:05:30,463 --> 00:05:32,867
but around here,
generally speaking,

92
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:35,368
the way to get on a show
isn't harassing the booker

93
00:05:35,402 --> 00:05:37,437
of the show during the show.

94
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:38,973
Got it?

95
00:05:39,006 --> 00:05:41,943
So just message the show page.

- Right, okay.

yokels, they're like...

- Fuckin' stuck-up bitch.
- "How do you know my dog?"

99
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:53,054
I was like, "I am too high to
be at the bar." This is crazy.

00:05:53,087 --> 00:05:54,454
They didn't know my dog,
they just heard me

talking to my dog.

102
00:05:55,756 --> 00:05:57,925

"What, what, what, what?

talking to my dog?

Sir, this is a dognapping
in progress.

105
00:06:03,496 --> 00:06:05,533
I'm not having any of it.
Are you kidding?

106
00:06:05,566 --> 00:06:08,603
You're gonna steal
my dog under my watch? No.

107

00:08:54,902 --> 00:08:56,837
- Okay.
- Oh, and you're welcome

171
00:08:56,871 --> 00:08:59,707
- for the bacon, by the way!
- Oh my...

172
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:02,176
Alright, cue one.

173
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:06,013
Cue two.

174
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:08,983
Next.

175
00:09:12,253 --> 00:09:14,088
What the fuck... Fredo?

176
00:09:14,121 --> 00:09:16,791
- Huh?
- What the fuck is this?

177
00:09:16,824 --> 00:09:18,159
Cue three.

178
00:09:18,192 --> 00:09:20,261
No, the... the blue,
what gel is this?

179
00:09:20,294 --> 00:09:21,762
Hmm?

180
00:09:21,796 --> 00:09:23,931
The blue, what gel did you use?

181
00:09:23,964 --> 00:09:26,033
It's a 60.

182
00:09:26,067 --> 00:09:28,736
No this... mist blue.

183
00:09:28,769 --> 00:09:30,805
I asked for a mist blue.

184
00:09:30,838 --> 00:09:32,706
Yeah, mist blue, this is 60.

185
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:36,343
No, 61 is mist blue,
60 is no color blue.

186
00:09:36,377 --> 00:09:39,080
You want me to look like
a corpse up here?

187
00:09:39,113 --> 00:09:40,281
My bad, sorry.

188
00:09:40,314 --> 00:09:42,016
Alright, well, switch it out.

189
00:09:42,049 --> 00:09:43,717
Corpse anyway.

190
00:09:43,751 --> 00:09:46,987
Oh, I'm glad you could make it.

191
00:09:54,028 --> 00:09:55,396
Is this what you got?

192
00:09:55,429 --> 00:09:58,132
- Yeah, that's what they had.
- Ugh.

193
00:09:58,165 --> 00:09:59,867
Alright, look,
if Gina gets upset,

194
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,402
it's your head, not mine.

195
00:10:01,435 --> 00:10:03,304
You got Gina Obispo?

196
00:10:03,337 --> 00:10:04,939
Yeah, she was in town.

197
00:10:04,972 --> 00:10:06,340
Nice get.

198
00:10:06,373 --> 00:10:07,942
What do you think I do all day?

199
00:10:07,975 --> 00:10:10,177
Set this up backstage.

200
00:10:10,211 --> 00:10:12,713
- Fredo.
- Yeah?

201
00:10:12,746 --> 00:10:14,648
Let's run it again,
uh, this time I'll pretend

202
00:10:14,682 --> 00:10:16,784
that I don't know
the blues are all fucked up.

203
00:10:16,817 --> 00:10:19,353
Yeah, I'll pretend I care.

204
00:10:19,386 --> 00:10:23,124
Oh, and uh,
Violet, don't forget,

205
00:10:23,157 --> 00:10:26,227
dark of the moon.

206
00:10:27,962 --> 00:10:30,731
I don't know why
but I feel so cosmo tonight.

207
00:10:30,764 --> 00:10:31,999
Cosmopolitan pink.

208
00:10:32,032 --> 00:10:33,734
Just add vodka
and I'm ready to drink.

209
00:10:33,767 --> 00:10:35,936
Aw, listen to me going on
about pink martinis with

210
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:37,838
and without cherries, here
I am supposed to be watching

211
00:10:37,872 --> 00:10:39,807
my figure and I tell you I have,
I've been watching it for years

212
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:40,908
and I still can't figure out
where it went,

213
00:10:40,941 --> 00:10:42,343
I know it's inside me somewhere.

214
00:10:42,376 --> 00:10:43,878
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

215
00:10:43,911 --> 00:10:47,314
(audience laughing)

216
00:10:47,348 --> 00:10:48,849
Hello? Oh, hi.

217
00:10:48,883 --> 00:10:51,819
- Do you have any ice back here?
- Hm?

218
00:10:51,852 --> 00:10:54,288
I mean I like warm well whiskey
as much as the next lady.

219
00:10:54,321 --> 00:10:55,389
- I just thought...
- Right.

220
00:10:55,422 --> 00:10:57,391
Get lucky
and live like a princess.

221
00:10:57,424 --> 00:10:59,827
You a comic?

222
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:01,729
I saw you writing
in that notebook.

223
00:11:01,762 --> 00:11:03,197
No, no, I just... I work for Bob.

224
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:05,366
- Is he making you take notes?
- No, no, no, no,

225
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:07,368
this is just something
I'm working on.

226
00:11:07,401 --> 00:11:10,771
Hmm, aren't we all
working on something?

227
00:11:10,804 --> 00:11:12,306
He's a cocksucker, right?

228
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:14,375
I don't...

229
00:11:14,408 --> 00:11:16,043
It's okay, I won't tell.

230
00:11:16,076 --> 00:11:17,745
You can admit it. Say it.

231
00:11:17,778 --> 00:11:19,880
I think it's more like
he just like loves

232
00:11:19,914 --> 00:11:21,482
for the show to be perfect.

233
00:11:21,516 --> 00:11:24,752
So he's a cocksucker.

234
00:11:24,785 --> 00:11:25,786
Yeah.

235
00:11:25,819 --> 00:11:28,155
Don't worry, uh...

236
00:11:28,189 --> 00:11:30,758
- Violet.
- Violet!

237
00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:32,293
They all are.

238
00:11:32,326 --> 00:11:34,395
- And you're a comic, so...
- Here she is...

239
00:11:34,428 --> 00:11:35,829
- I gotta go.
- ...Gina Obispo, everybody!

240
00:11:35,863 --> 00:11:39,800
- Be professional.
- Yep, to you.

241
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:42,403
(audience cheering)

242
00:11:42,436 --> 00:11:45,439
Hey, did you guys know
you can do a bunch of yoga

243
00:11:45,472 --> 00:11:47,241
and still be an asshole?

244
00:11:47,274 --> 00:11:49,511
(Audience laughing)

245
00:11:49,544 --> 00:11:52,746
My husband told me that,
random fact, I know.

246
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:53,781
And then he said,

247
00:11:53,814 --> 00:11:54,949
"It's not a random fact.

248
00:11:54,982 --> 00:11:58,819
I'm telling you to your face.

249
00:11:58,852 --> 00:11:59,920
You're an asshole."

250
00:11:59,954 --> 00:12:02,289
(Laughing)

251
00:12:02,323 --> 00:12:04,158
- Very intimate.
- Pretty great.

252
00:12:04,191 --> 00:12:05,527
You hear the laughs immediately.

253
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:08,329
Yeah, this is a treat.

254
00:12:08,362 --> 00:12:10,130
- Thanks for having me.
- Next time better bourbon.

255
00:12:10,164 --> 00:12:13,100
- Hey, it's the comedian.
- Hey, nice act.

256
00:12:13,133 --> 00:12:15,336
The comedian?

257
00:12:15,369 --> 00:12:16,770
Yeah, we met backstage earlier.

258
00:12:16,804 --> 00:12:18,939
No, no, this is Violet,
my assistant.

259
00:12:18,973 --> 00:12:21,842
Oh, are you... you have something
against women comedians?

260
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:23,877
Me? Never!

261
00:12:23,911 --> 00:12:25,513
I had two on the show,
you one of them.

262
00:12:25,547 --> 00:12:27,281
- Yeah, you're counting them.
- Right? Come on.

263
00:12:27,314 --> 00:12:28,349
On one hand.

264
00:12:28,382 --> 00:12:29,883
He's afraid of the competition.

265
00:12:29,917 --> 00:12:31,418
Oh, knock it off.

266
00:12:31,452 --> 00:12:33,320
Do you need something?

267
00:12:33,354 --> 00:12:35,089
I was just hoping
maybe I could hang with Gina...

268
00:12:35,122 --> 00:12:37,791
Hey, Bob, be careful
how you treat your assistants,

269
00:12:37,825 --> 00:12:40,494
cause they know
where the bodies are buried.

270
00:12:40,528 --> 00:12:43,497
Well, Violet would never
leave me, would you, Violet?

271
00:12:43,531 --> 00:12:50,404
No, no, no, in fact, I think you
would probably die without me.

272
00:12:53,874 --> 00:12:56,443
- Ah, Fredo!
- Uh, sorry.

273
00:12:56,477 --> 00:12:59,313
I forgot to ask um,
are you going to David's?

274
00:12:59,346 --> 00:13:00,848
- Oh, right, the cult thing?
- Yeah.

275
00:13:00,881 --> 00:13:03,317
- Yeah.
- Can I maybe ride with you?

276
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:05,052
Sure, yeah, I could use a drink.

277
00:13:05,085 --> 00:13:06,320
- Let's go.
- Oh.

278
00:13:06,353 --> 00:13:07,921
Well, not all the way
to the party,

279
00:13:07,955 --> 00:13:10,424
- my apartment's on the way, so.
- So you wanted a...

280
00:13:10,457 --> 00:13:12,960
- so you wanted a ride home?
- Mhm yeah, but you should go.

281
00:13:12,993 --> 00:13:14,161
- I should?
- Yes.

282
00:13:14,194 --> 00:13:15,829
- Why?
- Because you seem tense.

283
00:13:15,863 --> 00:13:17,298
No.

284
00:13:17,331 --> 00:13:19,567
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!

285
00:13:19,601 --> 00:13:21,503
Drink, my children!

286
00:13:21,536 --> 00:13:26,073
Drink and become one
with the cosmos!

287
00:13:26,106 --> 00:13:28,242
Ey, Vi's here!

288
00:13:28,275 --> 00:13:31,345
The prophecy has been fulfilled!

289
00:13:31,378 --> 00:13:33,247
Yes.

290
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,349
So your party
is mass suicide-themed?

291
00:13:35,382 --> 00:13:36,850
There's no comedy police, Vi.

292
00:13:36,884 --> 00:13:38,218
- Only censors.
- Oh.

293
00:13:38,252 --> 00:13:39,453
Oh shit, that's really good.

294
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:40,854
I gotta... I gotta write that
down.

295
00:13:40,888 --> 00:13:42,289
- Well...
- No, that's good.

296
00:13:42,323 --> 00:13:44,925
I don't know
if it's writing-down good.

297
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:48,429
(Indistinct chatter)

298
00:13:55,369 --> 00:13:58,506
Ah.

299
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:02,876
(muffled conversations)

300
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:06,447
Oh yeah,
look at all that value, Vi.

301
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:13,454
Ugh!

302
00:14:13,487 --> 00:14:16,457
Ugh.

303
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:19,460
Oh, congratulations, Violet,
you found a closet.

304
00:14:19,493 --> 00:14:22,029
- Slash my bedroom.
- Oh, sweet fancy cock.

305
00:14:22,062 --> 00:14:25,132
- Hi.
- Hi, Jimmy Rhodes.

306
00:14:25,165 --> 00:14:28,402
- Okay, hi.
- Hi, I rent David's closet.

307
00:14:28,435 --> 00:14:31,271
- Violet.
- Hello.

308
00:14:31,305 --> 00:14:35,677
Uh, it... I know it's small,
but it's also super pathetic.

309
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:39,446
- So...
- That tickles.

310
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,215
Well, I think we're trapped.

311
00:14:41,248 --> 00:14:42,983
What? Like existential...

312
00:14:43,016 --> 00:14:45,185
Uh, okay.

313
00:14:45,219 --> 00:14:49,123
- Right.
- Naughty like that.

314
00:14:49,156 --> 00:14:54,228
So um, what do you do
when you're not in your closet?

315
00:14:54,261 --> 00:14:57,097
I uh, I'm a dog walker.

316
00:14:57,131 --> 00:14:58,932
You're a comedian?

317
00:14:58,966 --> 00:15:01,168
- Yes.
- Uh, okay.

318
00:15:01,201 --> 00:15:03,170
Now, well,
you're in good company.

319
00:15:03,203 --> 00:15:04,371
Oh, do you do stand-up?

320
00:15:04,405 --> 00:15:06,473
No, but I'm a booker.

321
00:15:06,508 --> 00:15:07,509
I know.

322
00:15:07,542 --> 00:15:09,309
Then why'd you ask?

323
00:15:09,343 --> 00:15:11,111
I don't wanna seem desperate.

324
00:15:11,145 --> 00:15:13,113
Mhm, all right.

325
00:15:13,147 --> 00:15:14,516
Well, this is where you ask for
a spot

326
00:15:14,549 --> 00:15:17,484
and I tell you
to just message the show page.

327
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:19,019
Why would I do that?

328
00:15:19,052 --> 00:15:21,088
I mean you've never even
seen me perform.

329
00:15:21,121 --> 00:15:22,456
I could be terrible.

330
00:15:22,489 --> 00:15:25,392
Jimmy Rhodes, thank you.

331
00:15:25,426 --> 00:15:27,729
You're welcome. For what?

332
00:15:27,762 --> 00:15:29,597
Well, for being
the least desperate person

333
00:15:29,631 --> 00:15:32,132
I've met in years.

334
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:37,004
Well, give me a few minutes.

335
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:42,075
(chuckling)

336
00:15:42,109 --> 00:15:44,478
(howling)

337
00:15:44,512 --> 00:15:47,147
Uh, just not much further
you can go in Columbus.

338
00:15:47,181 --> 00:15:48,550
- Ooh.
- Comedy-wise.

339
00:15:48,583 --> 00:15:50,184
- Yeah.
- There are like a few clubs

340
00:15:50,217 --> 00:15:52,554
in the city, but you know,

341
00:15:52,587 --> 00:15:55,523
mostly you're going up
in between trivia nights

342
00:15:55,557 --> 00:15:58,492
and music open mics.

343
00:15:58,526 --> 00:16:00,294
It's pretty much
the same as here.

344
00:16:00,327 --> 00:16:02,697

when I was at a party

In two years, that bitch

Death of Comedy welcome

things there

Like I was at 7-Eleven,
2 in the morning.

771
00:36:46,874 --> 00:36:51,746
Also, there was a woman
who was very, very obese.

772
00:36:51,779 --> 00:36:54,247
Now, I am not including

773
00:36:54,281 --> 00:36:56,818
that detail to make fun of her,

774

I am including that detail,

775
00:36:58,853 --> 00:37:01,656
because she was also
wearing a t-shirt

776
00:37:01,689 --> 00:37:04,959
that said on it "No fat chicks".

777
00:37:04,992 --> 00:37:07,294
This lady fucking rules, man.

778
00:37:07,327 --> 00:37:10,363
This is the best lady,
because she is going out

779
00:37:10,397 --> 00:37:14,468
at a time of night when people
are most likely to be stoned

780
00:37:14,501 --> 00:37:16,738
and she is blowing their minds.

781
00:37:16,771 --> 00:37:18,806
- He's good, he's good.
- Because she's gonna be there

782
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:21,374
- and like they're gonna look...
- Yeah, he is.

783
00:37:21,408 --> 00:37:22,643
...and then they'll look up,
and she'll be like...

784
00:37:22,677 --> 00:37:24,277
- I hate him.
- "And yet here I am."

785
00:37:24,311 --> 00:37:26,346
Not like you know,
not like as a person, but.

786
00:37:26,379 --> 00:37:28,049
- Ooh, I hate him.
- Also, when she wears

787
00:37:28,082 --> 00:37:30,551
that shirt,
it becomes empowering.

788
00:37:30,585 --> 00:37:32,319
Like it should have
a comma on it.

789
00:37:32,352 --> 00:37:34,021
Like no comma.

790
00:37:34,055 --> 00:37:36,323

- Hey, how are you?

793

794
00:37:42,930 --> 00:37:46,033

with like a new lady.

795
00:37:46,067 --> 00:37:47,935
Not... the sex sounds good,
I'm just afraid

796
00:37:47,969 --> 00:37:49,937
- of like being made a fool.
- What are you doing here?

797
00:37:49,971 --> 00:37:52,305
- Like I'm worried...
- Your show is so great

798
00:37:52,339 --> 00:37:54,675
that you're turning away
paying customers?

799
00:37:54,709 --> 00:37:56,611
- It's free.
- And I'll be like, "Yeah!"

800
00:37:56,644 --> 00:37:58,345
- Do you need something?
- "Look at me go."

801
00:37:58,378 --> 00:37:59,580
No, I've never seen
your show before,

802

Yeah, but this is like just kind
of like my thing.

804
00:38:06,754 --> 00:38:09,557
Yeah, don't worry,
I'll keep a low profile.

805
00:38:09,590 --> 00:38:13,060
It turns out though,
it's actually super easy to tell

806
00:38:13,094 --> 00:38:15,696
if a woman is faking her orgasm.

807
00:38:15,730 --> 00:38:22,103
If during her orgasm a woman
is sexy, she is faking it.

808
00:38:22,136 --> 00:38:25,706
That is not what
that looks like.

809
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:29,376
If she's like, "Oh, Jesus,
baby." Get out of here.

810
00:38:29,409 --> 00:38:32,513
What am I, 12,
I'm gonna fall for that?

811

But if she's like, "Blah".

812
00:38:34,949 --> 00:38:37,985
Then it's like, "Yes! Yes!
