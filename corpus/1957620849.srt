00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:37,266
Anyway, after she went to
sleep I snuck into her room.

184
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:38,533
Sneaked.

185
00:09:38,566 --> 00:09:40,466
Crept silently into her room

186
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,566
and I ate every
goodie in the basket.

187
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,733
He was so sick, I didn't
have the heart to punish him.

188
00:09:45,766 --> 00:09:49,100
Janet: And I was so
angry the next day at school

189
00:09:49,133 --> 00:09:51,433
I let all the air out
of the bicycle tires.

190
00:09:51,466 --> 00:09:54,666
Rob: You did that?
You little brat.

191
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:56,533
I gave Buster Thompkins
a bloody nose for that.

192
00:09:56,566 --> 00:09:57,766
I know you did.

193
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,500
That's why I made Tracey
Johnson swear in blood

194
00:09:59,533 --> 00:10:00,933
she would never tell anybody.

195
00:10:00,966 --> 00:10:02,766
[laughter]

196
00:10:04,966 --> 00:10:06,833
Is that Dad's watch?

197
00:10:06,866 --> 00:10:08,166
Uh, yeah.

198
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,433
Looks nice doesn't it?
I had it cleaned.

199
00:10:10,466 --> 00:10:11,766
Yeah it really does.

200
00:10:13,533 --> 00:10:16,100
It's very valuable.
Take good care of it.

201
00:10:16,133 --> 00:10:17,933
It's really the only thing
of Dad's he has, you know.

202
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:21,733
I wasn't asking for it.

203
00:10:25,233 --> 00:10:26,766
I think I better
check the dryer.

204
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,100
Excuse me.

205
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:36,800
Listen, if Uncle
Robert really wants it,

206
00:10:36,833 --> 00:10:38,200
I mean, it was his dad's.

207
00:10:38,233 --> 00:10:40,166
Janet: Uncle Robert
just needs to grow up.

208
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,733
Something else is bothering him.

209
00:10:42,766 --> 00:10:44,700
Mother, he's always been
a little jealous of Eric.

210
00:10:44,733 --> 00:10:47,333
-You know that.
-What a thing to say.

211
00:10:47,366 --> 00:10:50,000
Janet: You know
how Dad adored Eric.

212
00:10:50,033 --> 00:10:54,000
We all adore Eric but Robert
is your one and only brother.

213
00:10:54,033 --> 00:10:56,533
Janet, please stop this.

214
00:10:56,566 --> 00:10:58,666
Eric, try another one
of your mom's rolls.

215
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:01,133
Go ahead, we have
dental insurance.

216
00:11:02,266 --> 00:11:04,600
Ha ha ha.

217
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,900
Eric: Actually they're
not too hard, Mom.

218
00:11:11,433 --> 00:11:12,800
Here you are.

219
00:11:12,833 --> 00:11:14,333
Why don't you come in and
visit with us for a while?

220
00:11:14,366 --> 00:11:15,933
Oh, they were watching
television so I...

221
00:11:15,966 --> 00:11:18,833
-We'll turn it off.
-No, it's okay.

222
00:11:18,866 --> 00:11:20,633
Oh goodness, look at
the weeds in this yard.

223
00:11:20,666 --> 00:11:21,900
Dad would have a stroke, huh?

224
00:11:22,933 --> 00:11:25,200
Remember when he used
to make us pick weeds?

225
00:11:25,233 --> 00:11:27,400
We were always picking
weeds, pulling weeds.

226
00:11:27,433 --> 00:11:28,366
Yeah.

227
00:11:29,266 --> 00:11:31,566
Does Mom seem a
little fuzzy to you?

228
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,266
Mom? Mom's fine.
She'll outlive us all.

229
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:36,766
The house is so dusty.
It isn't like her.

230
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,600
She'll have her
big spring cleaning

231
00:11:38,633 --> 00:11:40,600
and the whole
place will glisten.

232
00:11:43,533 --> 00:11:46,200
You were thinking about going
to grad school a while back.

233
00:11:46,233 --> 00:11:48,533
-Are you still?
-No.

234
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,266
You could knock off
your masters in no time.

235
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:55,166
Maybe teach college,
still have your summers.

236
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,466
Teach college?

237
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,833
Like you and Richard?

238
00:12:01,433 --> 00:12:02,733
Yes.

239
00:12:02,766 --> 00:12:04,733
It's funny, I thought
when Dad died

240
00:12:04,766 --> 00:12:06,600
I wouldn't have to
hear that anymore.

241
00:12:07,866 --> 00:12:11,500
You know, Eric was really
happy to get that watch.

242
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,833
Would've meant
a lot to me too.

243
00:12:14,866 --> 00:12:17,200
I guess Dad didn't
want me to have it.

244
00:12:17,233 --> 00:12:20,866
Rob, I know you and Dad had
your moments and it wasn't fun

245
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:22,633
but don't you think it's
time you let go of it?

246
00:12:22,666 --> 00:12:24,100
For your own sake.

247
00:12:24,133 --> 00:12:26,933
It's not the watch.
It's the principle.

248
00:12:26,966 --> 00:12:28,500
How do you think
that made Eric feel?

249
00:12:28,533 --> 00:12:30,266
All right, all right.

250
00:12:35,766 --> 00:12:36,833
[sighs]

251
00:12:40,266 --> 00:12:42,566
That woman you're
dating, Mary?

252
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,733
I like her.

253
00:12:44,666 --> 00:12:46,600
Yeah, I like her too.

254
00:12:46,633 --> 00:12:47,966
She's getting married.

255
00:12:49,933 --> 00:12:52,300
Well, there's a
lot more fish in...

256
00:12:54,833 --> 00:12:57,833
Jan, I know you're
trying to be helpful.

257
00:12:57,866 --> 00:13:00,066
I'd rather you
wouldn't meddle, huh?

258
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:01,300
Okay.

259
00:13:03,466 --> 00:13:04,866
It's a little cool
out here, anyway.

260
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,433
I'm going to go in.

261
00:13:09,966 --> 00:13:14,033
[crowd on TV cheers]

262
00:13:14,966 --> 00:13:17,266
TV Announcer: Forty, fifteen.

263
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:19,700
[Emily snoring]

264
00:13:23,033 --> 00:13:25,733
[Emily snoring]

265
00:13:26,966 --> 00:13:28,266
TV Announcer: Forty, thirty.

266
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:30,666
[crowd cheering]

267
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:33,166
[whispering]

268
00:13:35,833 --> 00:13:37,133
Mom.

269
00:13:38,566 --> 00:13:40,933
Oh. What time is it?

270
00:13:40,966 --> 00:13:43,933
After five. We have to go.

271
00:13:43,966 --> 00:13:46,066
-Where's Rob?
-He's out in the back.

272
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:49,200
You come and go so fast.

273
00:13:49,233 --> 00:13:50,933
I'll have to start making lists.

274
00:13:51,966 --> 00:13:54,966
I'll be remembering things
I wanted to tell you

275
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,200
for two weeks.

276
00:13:56,233 --> 00:13:57,600
Well, you know
our phone number.

277
00:13:57,633 --> 00:13:59,700
I hate to see you go.

278
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,766
Emily: Bye.

279
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:04,866
Bye, bye.

280
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:06,500
-Janet: Eric?
-Eric: Bye.

281
00:14:06,533 --> 00:14:08,366
Richard: So long. Thank you.

282
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,633
You bet.

283
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:11,933
Bye.

284
00:14:15,566 --> 00:14:18,866
You avoided your sister the
whole time they were here.

285
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:21,200
She's got her family.

286
00:14:21,233 --> 00:14:23,833
I want you have each other.

287
00:14:23,866 --> 00:14:25,433
We have each other, Ma.

288
00:14:28,233 --> 00:14:31,000
Mom, my car needs an overhaul.

289
00:14:31,033 --> 00:14:32,966
Could you let me have 500?

290
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:37,466
Well, yes of course, dear.

291
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:41,733
But uh, this will have
to be the last time.

292
00:14:41,766 --> 00:14:42,800
I don't want to strain you.

293
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:45,200
No, no.
There's no strain.

294
00:14:46,266 --> 00:14:48,866
You must learn to be more
careful with your money.

295
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:50,833
Yeah. I will Ma, honest.

296
00:14:52,066 --> 00:14:53,566
Want to take some food with you?

297
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,766
No, no, no.

298
00:14:55,366 --> 00:14:57,100
Do you want some coffee?

299
00:14:57,133 --> 00:14:58,566
No, no, I'm fine.

300
00:15:01,366 --> 00:15:02,500
I'll call you through the week.

301
00:15:02,533 --> 00:15:04,233
No, you won't.

302
00:15:04,266 --> 00:15:05,400
[Rob laughs]

303
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,200
Bye!

304
00:15:09,233 --> 00:15:10,266
Oh, Rob!

305
00:15:11,233 --> 00:15:14,100
You forgot the cake.
It's your favorite.

306
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,133
Keep your eye on the ball.

307
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:28,166
Attaboy Rob, hmm?

308
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,733
Father: Don't stand
on the plate.

309
00:15:30,766 --> 00:15:33,233
And get that bat
off your shoulders.

310
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:34,433
Ready?

311
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:37,966
I don't wanna play.

312
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,466
We've been out
here long enough.

313
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:52,700
Okay, if he doesn't practice
he won't make the team.

314
00:15:52,733 --> 00:15:56,300
But you make him feel so
bad every time he misses.

315
00:15:56,333 --> 00:15:58,200
Look, I don't care if
he isn't Joe DiMaggio

316
00:15:58,233 --> 00:16:01,133
I just want him to try.
He won't try.

317
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:04,966
Robbie?

318
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,733
Come on, let's give
it another shot, okay?

319
00:16:07,766 --> 00:16:10,300
-Get down.
-I don't want to.

320
00:16:10,333 --> 00:16:11,666
All right, stay
up there and pout.

321
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:14,233
Come on, Janet.

322
00:16:17,833 --> 00:16:19,366
My turn.

323
00:16:32,166 --> 00:16:33,633
Something wrong?

324
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:38,666
Uh, no, I was
watching the sunset.

325
00:16:41,866 --> 00:16:43,900
I'll be with you in a minute.

326
00:16:43,933 --> 00:16:47,266
Well, be quick about it.
We gotta pick up Gladys.

327
00:16:53,766 --> 00:16:55,300
Now, where's that purse?

328
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:57,233
[car horn]

329
00:16:57,266 --> 00:17:00,466
What do you suppose
is taking her so long?

330
00:17:01,633 --> 00:17:04,866
I'll bet you a doughnut
she can't find her purse.

331
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:17,600
[screams]

332
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,066
Henny: Hi.

333
00:17:39,533 --> 00:17:40,800
Em.

334
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,300
You're okay, Mom.

335
00:17:44,333 --> 00:17:45,633
They pinned your hip.

336
00:17:45,666 --> 00:17:47,566
You're as good as new.

337
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,700
I fell.

338
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,700
So far.

339
00:17:51,666 --> 00:17:55,000
You were very lucky.
That's a long stair.

340
00:17:55,033 --> 00:17:57,233
Hit my head.

341
00:17:59,466 --> 00:18:01,666
Then the lights...

342
00:18:03,866 --> 00:18:05,466
went out.

343
00:18:06,766 --> 00:18:07,966
Kept...

344
00:18:09,366 --> 00:18:10,366
falling.

345
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:13,600
Falling.

346
00:18:14,866 --> 00:18:17,066
Into darkness.

347
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:25,200
I thought I'd died.

348
00:18:28,433 --> 00:18:30,933
And the light came back.

349
00:18:34,266 --> 00:18:35,600
Here I am.

350
00:18:35,633 --> 00:18:37,700
Well you can
quit trying to die.

351
00:18:37,733 --> 00:18:39,400
The doctor says you're fine.

352
00:18:39,433 --> 00:18:42,566
Judy.
Oh, did anyone feed Judy?

353
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:46,233
No. We've been here night
and day, waiting for you.

354
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,800
How are you feeling?

355
00:18:48,833 --> 00:18:52,366
Well, I'm still here.

356
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:56,033
[laughs]

357
00:18:56,066 --> 00:18:57,766
Mom, I have to
go see the doctor,

358
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,600
and then I will go
by and I'll feed Judy

359
00:18:59,633 --> 00:19:00,933
and I'll be right back.
I promise.

360
00:19:00,966 --> 00:19:03,366
No. Henny can do that.

361
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,000
You go home.

362
00:19:05,033 --> 00:19:06,500
Don't be silly.

363
00:19:09,466 --> 00:19:10,533
[Emily groans]

364
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:12,333
Henny.

365
00:19:14,566 --> 00:19:16,200
Where's Rob?

366
00:19:16,233 --> 00:19:17,600
He was here.

367
00:19:17,633 --> 00:19:19,933
We sent him home
to get some sleep.

368
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:23,833
You can get that gerbil
food out of here.

369
00:19:23,866 --> 00:19:25,366
I brought her supper.

370
00:19:26,233 --> 00:19:27,833
Don't look at me like that.

371
00:19:27,866 --> 00:19:30,333
My mother-in-law
built this hospital

372
00:19:30,366 --> 00:19:34,100
and my husband was chief
of staff for 34 years.

373
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:40,666
[laughter]

374
00:19:42,433 --> 00:19:46,033
Doctor: Janet, the broken hip
wasn't the result of the fall.

375
00:19:46,066 --> 00:19:48,800
In all likelihood the
fracture occurred naturally

376
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:50,433
and caused your mother to fall.

377
00:19:50,466 --> 00:19:51,966
Naturally?

378
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:55,066
She twisted her
hip and it snapped,

379
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,800
before she fell.

380
00:19:56,833 --> 00:19:58,433
Her bones are pretty brittle.

381
00:19:58,466 --> 00:20:00,566
Most Caucasian women her
age suffer from osteoporosis

382
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:01,600
to some extent.

383
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,300
How soon will she
be able to walk?

384
00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:05,900
I mean really walk?

385
00:20:05,933 --> 00:20:07,400
It's impossible to say.

386
00:20:07,433 --> 00:20:11,433
Now, barring complications,
I can let her out in a week

387
00:20:11,466 --> 00:20:13,966
providing she responds well
to physical therapy

388
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,400
and assuming you plan to
provide some help at home.

389
00:20:16,433 --> 00:20:18,166
Oh, certainly.

390
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:18,866
Good.

391
00:20:19,966 --> 00:20:22,666
She's probably going to need
some degree of home care

392
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:24,400
from here on in.

393
00:20:24,433 --> 00:20:25,933
From here on in?

394
00:20:25,966 --> 00:20:28,433
A mother falls down the stairs
and all of a sudden she's old?

395
00:20:34,266 --> 00:20:36,666
Intercom: Doctor Kankay 
please call the operator.

396
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:40,133
Doctor Kankay please
call the operator.

397
00:20:40,166 --> 00:20:43,100
She's coming to my house.
It's all decided.

398
00:20:43,133 --> 00:20:46,066
Oh no, Mom.
You're gonna come home with me.

399
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:47,366
No, no.

400
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:50,966
You have classes to
teach, a husband, a son.

401
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,100
I don't want to
burden you that way.

402
00:20:53,133 --> 00:20:55,166
Not only that, you'll spoil her.

403
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,900
-I know what she needs.
-[laughs]

404
00:20:57,933 --> 00:21:00,433
I've already made arrangements
to take next week off.

405
00:21:00,466 --> 00:21:01,733
Emily: No, no.

406
00:21:01,766 --> 00:21:03,900
This is easier all
the way around.

407
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:13,233
I took Judy to the vet.

408
00:21:13,266 --> 00:21:14,933
She hates that vet.

409
00:21:16,166 --> 00:21:19,466
The Gustavsson boy,
he can feed her.

410
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:23,033
The Gustavsson boy got
married and moved to Maine.

411
00:21:23,066 --> 00:21:25,200
We went to the wedding.

412
00:21:27,733 --> 00:21:32,466
Mom, Judy's sick and the
vet wants to put her to sleep.

413
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,100
Oh, no.

414
00:21:34,133 --> 00:21:36,233
No, no, no, no.

415
00:21:36,266 --> 00:21:37,633
Janet: It'll be all right.

416
00:21:37,666 --> 00:21:40,533
It's really the best
thing for her, you know.

417
00:21:40,566 --> 00:21:42,700
Right. Fine, fine.

418
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,966
Try and get some sleep.

419
00:21:52,666 --> 00:21:54,000
Janet: Good night.

420
00:21:54,033 --> 00:21:55,533
Henny: See you tomorrow.

421
00:22:04,033 --> 00:22:07,100
[Emily dreaming] But I don't 
want a puppy, Arthur.

422
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:16,300
Somebody dumped the poor thing

423
00:22:16,333 --> 00:22:18,333
in the alley behind
the drugstore.

424
00:22:18,366 --> 00:22:20,500
I couldn't just leave her.

425
00:22:20,533 --> 00:22:22,800
There'll be hair
all over the place.

426
00:22:22,833 --> 00:22:24,433
It'll ruin the upholstery

427
00:22:24,466 --> 00:22:27,333
and I don't have time
to train a puppy.

428
00:22:27,366 --> 00:22:30,200
But you'd have her if
anything happens to me.

429
00:22:30,233 --> 00:22:31,900
Nothing is going
to happen to you.

430
00:22:31,933 --> 00:22:35,033
Em, I've already
had one heart attack.

431
00:22:35,066 --> 00:22:36,400
I may not be so
lucky the next time.

432
00:22:36,433 --> 00:22:38,866
Please, don't be so morbid.

433
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:40,366
I don't want a puppy.

434
00:22:41,366 --> 00:22:43,966
We'll keep her till
I can find her a home.

435
00:22:46,166 --> 00:22:48,366
Well, then put her
down in the basement.

436
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,866
[dog whimpers]

437
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:55,100
Aw.

438
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:57,466
Aw.

439
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,600
Aw, she's trembling.

440
00:23:01,266 --> 00:23:03,766
Aw, I'll give her some milk.

441
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:06,500
Make sure it's warm.

442
00:23:06,533 --> 00:23:08,200
I'm calling her Judy.

443
00:23:09,933 --> 00:23:11,733
[laughs] Judy.

444
00:23:11,766 --> 00:23:16,033
Oh, Judy, Judy, Judy.

445
00:23:18,133 --> 00:23:19,300
[bell dings]

446
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:30,966
-Woman: We've got you.
-Man: Are you ready?

447
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,466
All the way up now.

448
00:23:36,266 --> 00:23:37,366
Woman: Easy.

449
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,766
-Man: Push on my hand.
-[Emily gasps]

450
00:23:41,933 --> 00:23:43,100
Man: Good.

451
00:23:43,133 --> 00:23:45,766
Emily: It's too soon.
I can't.

452
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,533
Get out of that chair!

453
00:23:47,566 --> 00:23:49,033
Who let her in?

454
00:23:49,066 --> 00:23:50,900
You stop feeling
sorry for yourself

455
00:23:50,933 --> 00:23:52,933
and get out of that chair.

456
00:23:52,966 --> 00:23:55,566
Take my hand, come on.

457
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:57,900
Up.

458
00:23:58,433 --> 00:24:00,566
Come on. Good.

459
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,266
Let her go, she can do it.

460
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:05,333
-It hurts.
-Oh, sure it hurts.

461
00:24:05,366 --> 00:24:09,133
I feel the same every morning
when my arthritis kicks in.

462
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:15,000
Man: Come on, all the way.
Good.

463
00:24:15,033 --> 00:24:17,866
Don't baby her.
She'll eat it with a spoon.

464
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:19,600
I will not.

465
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:23,933
Man: Take a step.

466
00:24:25,066 --> 00:24:26,200
One more.

467
00:24:27,133 --> 00:24:28,700
[laughs]

468
00:24:28,733 --> 00:24:30,333
Man: Straighten
up just a bit more.

469
00:24:36,833 --> 00:24:38,133
Henny: Yahoo!

470
00:24:38,166 --> 00:24:41,066
She'll be jitterbugging
by the fourth of July.

471
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:42,933
Oh, throw her out.

472
00:24:46,833 --> 00:24:48,400
That damn doctor.

473
00:24:49,133 --> 00:24:51,400
Making us sit around till noon.

474
00:24:51,433 --> 00:24:53,633
I'll cancel my hair appointment.

475
00:24:53,666 --> 00:24:56,033
Oh no, you go ahead.
I'll get Mama something to eat.

476
00:24:56,066 --> 00:24:57,833
What about Eric's track meet?

477
00:24:57,866 --> 00:25:00,700
Well, I've already
missed it, Mom. Here.

478
00:25:00,733 --> 00:25:03,033
Wait a minute,
let us help you there.

479
00:25:03,066 --> 00:25:06,000
They showed her what
to do in the hospital.

480
00:25:06,033 --> 00:25:07,466
[Emily gasping]

481
00:25:12,233 --> 00:25:13,766
Here.

482
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,500
One, there.

483
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,433
Sit down for a minute.

484
00:25:21,166 --> 00:25:22,433
It's so nice out here.

485
00:25:22,466 --> 00:25:23,766
Why don't I just bring
your lunch out here?

486
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:26,766
We could have lunch
on the porch, huh?

487
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:29,166
-[gasping]
-Sound good?

488
00:25:32,066 --> 00:25:34,300
[gasping]

489
00:25:34,333 --> 00:25:36,700
What am I gonna do, Henny?

490
00:25:36,733 --> 00:25:39,033
Don't blubber in front of her.

491
00:25:39,066 --> 00:25:40,800
I've heard you blubbering.

492
00:25:40,833 --> 00:25:43,466
You've done your
share of blubbering.

493
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,866
You might as well enjoy this.

494
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:48,000
I fully expect you

495
00:25:48,033 --> 00:25:51,300
to wait on me hand and foot

496
00:25:51,333 --> 00:25:53,633
if I ever decide to get old.

497
00:25:55,366 --> 00:25:58,033
Get me a tissue from my purse.

498
00:25:58,066 --> 00:25:59,433
Get it yourself.

499
00:26:04,533 --> 00:26:06,666
What a mean old snake.

500
00:26:07,533 --> 00:26:08,933
When I get rid of this cane

501
00:26:08,966 --> 00:26:11,600
I'm going to kick you
from here to the corner.

502
00:26:11,633 --> 00:26:14,833
[laughs]

503
00:26:16,866 --> 00:26:18,633
You call me if
you need anything.

504
00:26:18,666 --> 00:26:21,066
-Anything.
-Yes.

505
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:24,233
All right now, go ahead.
Go.

506
00:26:24,266 --> 00:26:26,633
Why don't you take a
couple bites before I go.

507
00:26:26,666 --> 00:26:30,033
-I'm not a child.
-I know, I just want you to eat.

508
00:26:31,366 --> 00:26:32,533
All right.

509
00:26:33,533 --> 00:26:34,866
I'm eating.

510
00:26:35,933 --> 00:26:37,300
Now go.

511
00:26:39,933 --> 00:26:41,066
Okay.

512
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,600
Why don't I bring the phone out?

513
00:26:45,633 --> 00:26:47,733
Would you like me to bring
the phone out here for you?

514
00:26:47,766 --> 00:26:49,600
Please. Go.

515
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:53,166
I love you.

516
00:27:02,266 --> 00:27:03,733
Jan!

517
00:27:09,333 --> 00:27:12,200
I dropped my fork.

518
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:19,833
Well, I'll just have to take
it in and rinse it off, then.

519
00:27:32,133 --> 00:27:33,733
Hi.

520
00:27:33,766 --> 00:27:37,033
-Eric: Hi Mom.
-Hello, Honey.

521
00:27:37,066 --> 00:27:39,333
They kept us waiting for
hours at that hospital.

522
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:43,000
And then Mom was so depressed
I just couldn't leave her.

523
00:27:43,033 --> 00:27:44,466
So who won the track meet?

524
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:47,000
-We did.
-Janet: Congratulations.

525
00:27:47,033 --> 00:27:48,133
Thanks.

526
00:27:48,766 --> 00:27:50,166
[laughter]

527
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:52,033
What's going on?

528
00:27:52,066 --> 00:27:55,033
Well hey, if you'd
been there you'd know.

529
00:27:55,066 --> 00:27:56,300
What?

530
00:27:56,333 --> 00:27:59,200
I broke the school
record for the 400.

531
00:27:59,233 --> 00:28:01,366
Eric, that's wonderful!

532
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:03,500
That's great. Congratulations.

533
00:28:03,533 --> 00:28:05,400
He was beautiful.

534
00:28:05,433 --> 00:28:07,366
And now he has to go and
have his picture taken

535
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,833
for the newspaper.

536
00:28:08,866 --> 00:28:10,166
Right.

537
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,800
Mom, you should've been there.
It was something.

538
00:28:12,833 --> 00:28:16,300
-I'm so proud of you.
-Thank you.

539
00:28:16,333 --> 00:28:19,166
Okay, I gotta go.
We'll see ya.

540
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,033
-Richard: Have a good one.
-Eric: Thanks!

541
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,666
Janet: Aunt Henny went
off to get her hair done

542
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:28,333
and Mom started crying.

543
00:28:29,466 --> 00:28:31,266
Richard, I've never
seen her like this.

544
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:32,933
She's really a mess.

545
00:28:33,933 --> 00:28:36,333
Do you have any
idea how your son felt

546
00:28:36,366 --> 00:28:37,966
when he realized you
weren't there today?

547
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,233
It's simple physics,

548
00:28:39,266 --> 00:28:41,866
I mean, I can't be in
two places at one time.

549
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:45,300
I know. I'm sorry.

550
00:28:46,733 --> 00:28:48,566
It's just that ever
since your mother fell

551
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,366
you been so wrapped up in her...

552
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,433
We miss you.

553
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:55,733
I miss you.

554
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:57,966
Yeah.

555
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:01,566
Well, at least now she's
out of the hospital.

556
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:04,366
If anybody's going to get her
up on her feet in record time,

557
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,066
it's going to be Aunt Henny.

558
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:10,066
So, Jonathan comes home from
the war sporting a mustache

559
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:11,566
and my mother-in-law
says to me,

560
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,966
"I can't stand that
boy's mustache."

561
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,633
Well, I looked her
straight in the eye

562
00:29:15,666 --> 00:29:18,700
and said, "Well, Ethel,
I can't stand yours either."

563
00:29:18,733 --> 00:29:20,933
[laughter]

564
00:29:22,033 --> 00:29:23,166
Oh!

565
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:25,000
My trick.

566
00:29:25,033 --> 00:29:26,733
[jeering]

567
00:29:26,766 --> 00:29:28,900
You dirty underhanded dog.

568
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:31,500
-Where did you hide that trump?
-[laughs]

569
00:29:31,533 --> 00:29:33,800
What kind of medication
are you on anyway?

570
00:29:33,833 --> 00:29:36,466
Maybe I should have a dose.

571
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:38,433
[laughter]

572
00:29:39,966 --> 00:29:41,400
Excuse me.

573
00:29:41,433 --> 00:29:42,866
Henny: What, again?

574
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:45,633
She laughed so
hard she had to...

575
00:29:45,666 --> 00:29:47,200
I hope you make it.

576
00:29:47,233 --> 00:29:50,566
[laughter]

577
00:29:53,533 --> 00:29:56,533
I'm going to have
my bedtime nightcap.

578
00:29:56,566 --> 00:29:58,000
You want one?

579
00:29:58,033 --> 00:29:59,800
I have to take my medicine.

580
00:30:00,766 --> 00:30:03,100
And just where do
you think clean living

581
00:30:03,133 --> 00:30:05,100
is going to get you at your age?

582
00:30:06,333 --> 00:30:09,700
Do you ever feel like
you're drifting away?

583
00:30:09,733 --> 00:30:10,766
What?

584
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:13,333
What are you talking about?

585
00:30:13,366 --> 00:30:14,833
I don't want to give up.

586
00:30:15,566 --> 00:30:17,366
I want to go on and on.

587
00:30:18,966 --> 00:30:21,466
The medication is doing this.

588
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:23,433
I don't want to give up.

589
00:30:23,466 --> 00:30:25,766
I want to go on and on.

590
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:27,966
I heard you the first time.

591
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,666
You're going to have
a nightcap with me.

592
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:34,733
You need to relax,
you need to rest.

593
00:30:35,866 --> 00:30:38,066
And tomorrow we're going
to have something done

594
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:40,666
about your hair.
You look like Mother Time.

595
00:30:42,233 --> 00:30:43,433
Henny...

596
00:30:45,266 --> 00:30:47,633
You just keep going, don't you?

597
00:30:49,766 --> 00:30:52,100
I'm running scared sweetie.

598
00:30:52,133 --> 00:30:53,666
I always did and I always will.

599
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:55,266
What do you want, bourbon?

600
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,033
What's the matter?

601
00:30:59,066 --> 00:31:01,733
Are you afraid of dying
with liquor on your breath?

602
00:31:01,766 --> 00:31:04,233
[laughs]

603
00:31:11,066 --> 00:31:16,033
[humming]

604
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:25,933
Henny, I don't want a drink!

605
00:31:32,133 --> 00:31:35,000
[whistling]

606
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,266
Henny.

607
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:52,600
Oh, God.

608
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:54,833
No.

609
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,266
No.

610
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:04,266
No, no, no, no, no.

611
00:32:12,433 --> 00:32:15,766
Minister: I am the life
and the resurrection.

612

The light of world by whom
all believers shall not perish

613
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,900
but find everlasting life.

614
00:32:24,866 --> 00:32:27,200
She never had a
sick day in her life.

615
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:30,466
She never saw the end coming.

616
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:33,433
That's the best way, Jan.

617
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:38,066
I think you should come home
and stay with us now, Mom.

618
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:40,566
I have to get on with my life.

619
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,933
Well then, we'll bring
someone in to stay with you.

620
00:32:42,966 --> 00:32:45,433
No. I'll manage.

621
00:32:45,466 --> 00:32:46,766
Take it from me, Grandma,

622
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:49,700
you do not argue with Mom
when she uses that tone.

623
00:32:49,733 --> 00:32:52,166
[laughing]

624
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,733
All right, there we go.

625
00:32:54,766 --> 00:32:55,900
Eric: Okay.

626
00:32:57,966 --> 00:33:01,133
I'm going back
upstairs in two weeks.

627
00:33:01,166 --> 00:33:05,566
-About the yard--
-I'll get somebody this week.

628
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:08,066
Okay. I'm gonna call that
home care agency.

629
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:09,600
Emily: I'll call
them in the morning.

630
00:33:09,633 --> 00:33:12,133
-Eric: I'll get sheets.
-Richard: Okay.

631
00:33:12,166 --> 00:33:13,800
Is that bed comfortable?

632
00:33:13,833 --> 00:33:15,500
It is to me.

633
00:33:15,533 --> 00:33:17,500
You were both conceived on it.

634
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:21,033
Well, I think we better
get the night stands.

635
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,600
This is strange.

636
00:33:28,833 --> 00:33:32,766
I always wanted
a bed-sitting-room.

637

-Hello.
-Robert: Hi Mom.

642
00:34:04,033 --> 00:34:06,066
Oh Rob, yes dear.

643
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:09,066
-Rob: How you feeling?
-Oh fine, fine.

644
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:10,533
It's really good to be home.

645
00:34:10,566 --> 00:34:12,000
Robert: What are you doing?

646
00:34:12,033 --> 00:34:14,200
I'm hopping around,
doing all kinds of things.

647
00:34:14,233 --> 00:34:16,600
Robert: Great, I thought 
I'd come over tonight.

648
00:34:16,633 --> 00:34:18,200
Oh that would be lovely.

649
00:34:18,233 --> 00:34:21,000
And I'll make a London Broil?

650
00:34:21,033 --> 00:34:22,766
-Robert: Terrific, when's good?
-Well anytime, dear.

651
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:23,966
Come any time.

652
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,833

-Bye.

[knocking]

654
00:34:34,933 --> 00:34:36,200
Just a minute!

655
00:34:43,066 --> 00:34:44,466
Yes?

656
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:47,300
Look here, my mower
don't cut grass this thick.

657
00:34:47,333 --> 00:34:49,500
Well, if you were
here last week

658
00:34:49,533 --> 00:34:52,066
like you were supposed to...

659
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:54,466
I really need the grass cut.

660
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:56,000
Can you get another mower?

661
00:34:56,033 --> 00:34:57,333
I doubt it.

662
00:34:59,466 --> 00:35:01,100
I'll see.

663
00:35:01,133 --> 00:35:02,500
Thank you.

-Oh Rob, yes.
-Robert: I can't make it.

674
00:36:33,366 --> 00:36:36,133
Oh well, of
course I understand.

PTA meeting I forgot about.

676
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:40,766
Well, maybe sometime next week?

Oh, no, no,
nothing's the matter.

681
00:36:47,933 --> 00:36:50,500
I was just, uh, napping.

look after yourself.

Oh boy, do I
wish you were here.

687
00:37:39,033 --> 00:37:41,833
We're having some people
from Richard's department in.

688
00:37:41,866 --> 00:37:43,933
I have to feed them all.

689
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:50,600
Mom, how's your new housekeeper?

690
00:37:50,633 --> 00:37:53,133
Oh well, you know

691
00:37:53,166 --> 00:37:56,033
I don't like to have
strange people in my house.

692
00:37:57,233 --> 00:37:58,833
The Dean is
coming tonight, Mom.

693
00:37:58,866 --> 00:38:00,433
Richard's all in knots.

694
00:38:00,466 --> 00:38:02,200
We're hoping he'll
announce his promotion.

695
00:38:03,533 --> 00:38:06,166
I'll cross my fingers for you.

696
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:09,466
-I shouldn't have called her.
-Yes you should, go on.

697
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:12,866
-Um.
-Is everything all right?

698
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:15,800
Oh, it couldn't be better.

699
00:38:15,833 --> 00:38:19,033
I'll call you in a day or two.
Bye.

700
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:23,666
She's having a dinner party.

701
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:25,933
I shouldn't have bothered her.

702
00:38:25,966 --> 00:38:27,866
Then call Robert.

703
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:31,100
Let's not talk about this.

704
00:38:31,133 --> 00:38:34,100
I'm not going crying
to my children.

705
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:42,100
Don't do that.

706
00:38:44,433 --> 00:38:47,266
At least let me
water the plants.

707
00:38:54,666 --> 00:38:56,133
Oh my God.

708
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,466
-Em!
-[sighs]

709
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,566
She just didn't
sound like herself.

710
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:05,433
Honey, you just
worry too much.

711
00:39:05,466 --> 00:39:06,666
You know what?

712
00:39:08,433 --> 00:39:09,733
Let me help you.

713
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:13,866
-You think I'll ruin this?
-No.

714
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:16,933
I just thought
that if I help you

715
00:39:16,966 --> 00:39:19,600
we could find a little time
for ourselves later on?

716
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:25,233
I'll tell you

00:50:09,133 --> 00:50:10,633
I appreciate your concern.

892
00:50:10,666 --> 00:50:13,233
[police radio]

893
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,400
-She's all right.
-Has she seen the doctor yet?

894
00:50:24,433 --> 00:50:25,200
Yes.

895
00:50:25,900 --> 00:50:27,666
Did she get a look at the guy?

896
00:50:27,700 --> 00:50:30,600
Well, she thinks it's the
man who came to cut her lawn.

897
00:50:30,633 --> 00:50:32,300
Oh, God.

898
00:50:32,333 --> 00:50:33,566
Where did you find this guy?

899
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:36,000
Well, he was just
a name in the paper.

900
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:40,333
Well the police want to know.

901
00:50:40,366 --> 00:50:42,733
Yeah, yeah, well I'll
see if I can dig it up.

902
00:50:42,766 --> 00:50:45,833
Rob, I'm going to take her
home with me for a while.

903
00:50:45,866 --> 00:50:47,233
Yeah, okay, okay.

904
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,766
Mom.

905
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:07,100
Mom, I'm really sorry.

906
00:51:07,133 --> 00:51:09,433
-These things happen.
-I know but...

907
00:51:09,466 --> 00:51:10,933
Janet: Anybody want
some more coffee?

908
00:51:10,966 --> 00:51:13,466
-Me. Please.
-Yeah, I'll have a cup.

909
00:51:15,533 --> 00:51:17,666
Emily, it's pretty obvious

910
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:20,033
you can't stay here by yourself.

911
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:26,033
We'll talk about
this in the morning.

912
00:51:26,066 --> 00:51:27,400
Sure Mom.

913
00:51:27,433 --> 00:51:28,833
Good night now.

914
00:51:28,866 --> 00:51:30,933
-Richard: Good night.
-Good night.

915
00:51:30,966 --> 00:51:32,600
I'll be up in a little while.

916
00:51:34,900 --> 00:51:36,533
Richard, if she leaves,

917
00:51:36,566 --> 00:51:38,333
she'll be afraid
when she comes back.

918
00:51:38,366 --> 00:51:40,166
We'll get her some
lights in the yard,

919
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:42,233
some decent locks and
some kind of an alarm.

920
00:51:42,266 --> 00:51:44,600
-You can't be serious.
-I am serious.

921
00:51:44,633 --> 00:51:46,233
You don't have anything
to say about it.

922
00:51:46,266 --> 00:51:47,533
I think he does, Rob.

923
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:50,900
-Thank you.
-We'll get her another dog.

924
00:51:50,933 --> 00:51:53,000
-Are you nuts?
-No, I'm not nuts.

925
00:51:53,033 --> 00:51:55,633
I should've insisted she come
stay with us a month ago.

926
00:51:55,666 --> 00:51:57,133
No, no, no. It was my fault.

927
00:51:57,166 --> 00:51:58,966
It was my fault.
I should've been here.

928
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,466
I'll come back, I'll move here
for a week or two.

929
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:02,666
And then what?

930
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:04,733
Jan, if you take her away

931
00:52:04,766 --> 00:52:05,933
from everything
she knows and loves

932
00:52:05,966 --> 00:52:07,233
she'll give up.

933
00:52:07,266 --> 00:52:09,033
She looks worse
now than when she did

934
00:52:09,066 --> 00:52:10,633
when she came home
from the hospital.

935
00:52:10,666 --> 00:52:12,700
If you two want to force her
out of here against her will

936
00:52:12,733 --> 00:52:13,966
I don't want any part of it.

937
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,433
Just what the hell
were you a part of, Rob?

938
00:52:15,466 --> 00:52:17,533
I don't have to
take that from you!

939
00:52:17,566 --> 00:52:19,200
You're not part
of the solution.

940
00:52:19,233 --> 00:52:20,700
Emily: Stop this!

941
00:52:20,733 --> 00:52:22,600
[screaming]

942
00:52:23,266 --> 00:52:24,500
Mom?

943
00:52:24,900 --> 00:52:26,700
Mom...

944
00:52:26,733 --> 00:52:28,500
Come on, I got you.

945
00:52:29,700 --> 00:52:31,200
[panting] Darn it.

946
00:52:31,233 --> 00:52:35,433
Janet, I don't
want any fighting.

947
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:39,966
No fighting, do you hear me?

948
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:49,900
You gotta let
us help you, Mom.

949
00:52:51,166 --> 00:52:54,300
And I don't know how to do that
unless you come home with me.

950
00:52:56,533 --> 00:52:57,733
All right.

951
00:53:02,366 --> 00:53:04,266
It's not the end of the world.

952
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:07,200
It's just for a little while.

953
00:53:09,933 --> 00:53:11,900
I can't fight you, Janet.

954
00:53:13,533 --> 00:53:14,766
I'm too tired.

955
00:53:15,700 --> 00:53:18,066
It's gonna be fun
having you around.

956
00:53:22,766 --> 00:53:25,900
Such a battle, being alive.

957
00:53:29,366 --> 00:53:33,333
Lie down at night,
close your eyes,

958
00:53:33,366 --> 00:53:35,400
and add up your wins and losses,

959
00:53:35,433 --> 00:53:37,933
get ready for
tomorrow's onslaught.

960
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:44,366
But when the years...

961
00:53:46,666 --> 00:53:50,600
In spite of all your efforts,

962
00:53:51,866 --> 00:53:55,000
when the years
are out in front...

963
00:54:02,133 --> 00:54:03,600
Now what do you do?

964
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,800
You let me worry about that.

965
00:54:15,533 --> 00:54:16,933
Mama.

966
00:54:27,066 --> 00:54:30,233
So, we'll just move all the
things you use every day.

967
00:54:30,266 --> 00:54:33,766
-Okay?
-Fine, but I want my books.

968
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:34,933
Yeah.

969
00:54:44,533 --> 00:54:46,366
I'm sorry, Eric.

970
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:47,933
We only have one
downstairs bedroom.

971
00:54:47,966 --> 00:54:50,533
Why can't she go to
live with Uncle Robert?

972
00:54:50,566 --> 00:54:53,900
He lives alone,
he's got an extra bedroom.

973
00:54:53,933 --> 00:54:57,100
This is something that your
mom feels that she has to do.

974
00:54:57,133 --> 00:54:58,500
[sighs]

975
00:54:58,533 --> 00:54:59,866
We've got to back her up.

976
00:55:00,733 --> 00:55:01,833
Okay?

977
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:04,833
All right.

978
00:55:04,866 --> 00:55:07,100
Okay Mom, you're all packed.

979
00:55:10,100 --> 00:55:11,833
What are you doing?

980
00:55:11,866 --> 00:55:16,100
Putting my mother's china
in Rob's storage locker

981
00:55:16,133 --> 00:55:17,433
while I'm away.

982
00:55:17,466 --> 00:55:19,200
Well if you're worried
about it we can take it.

983
00:55:19,233 --> 00:55:21,266
No, no, it's no
problem, really.

984
00:55:26,733 --> 00:55:28,933
Did you give him
Grandma's china?

985
00:55:28,966 --> 00:55:31,100
He's just keeping it for me.

986
00:55:31,133 --> 00:55:32,633
Oh mother, you
know good and well

987
00:55:32,666 --> 00:55:34,300
if he gets in a
bind he'll sell it.

988
00:55:34,333 --> 00:55:36,466
I don't know any such thing.

989
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:39,800
You don't know anything when it
comes to your golden boy.

990
00:55:43,466 --> 00:55:46,200
Emily: And thanks
so much for coming.

991
00:55:46,233 --> 00:55:48,466
Did I tell you I
sold my house, Em?

992
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:52,433
She didn't sell her house,
she gave it to the first buyer.

993
00:55:52,466 --> 00:55:54,600
When are you leaving, Gladys?

994
00:55:54,633 --> 00:55:56,033
Saturday.

995
00:55:56,066 --> 00:56:00,900
Now listen, it isn't even
forty miles to Riverview

996
00:56:00,933 --> 00:56:03,266
and when you get home
you call me

997
00:56:03,300 --> 00:56:07,333
and I'll come down and
I'll stay a week or so.

998
00:56:12,166 --> 00:56:13,666
I don't hug, Em.

999
00:56:14,233 --> 00:56:15,300
You know that.

1000
00:56:16,666 --> 00:56:18,366
Write me, Gladys.

1001
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:20,800
Oh! You'll be back in no time.

1002
00:56:39,233 --> 00:56:40,366
She looks awful.

1003
00:56:41,266 --> 00:56:45,333
I never thought she'd give up.
Not her.

1004
00:56:45,366 --> 00:56:47,600
We're never gonna
see her again.

1005
00:56:48,900 --> 00:56:51,466
Get in the car,
I'll take you home.

1006
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:55,700
We're in my car, Gladys.
Now get a move on.

1007
00:56:55,733 --> 00:56:57,800
I have to get back
to the library.

1008
00:56:57,833 --> 00:56:59,033
[car horn]

1009
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:11,066
Hey Grandma.

1010
00:57:11,100 --> 00:57:12,633
-Hi Miss Stanton.
-[kissing sound]

1011
00:57:13,666 --> 00:57:15,733
-Janet: Come on over.
-Richard: Hello Emily.

1012
00:57:15,766 --> 00:57:17,300
-Richard: How are you?
-Janet: Eric?

1013
00:57:17,333 --> 00:57:18,966
Will you and
Tommy get the bags?

1014
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,166
Eric: Yeah.

1015
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:22,133
-Emily: Don't fuss, don't fuss.
-[coughing]

1016
00:57:23,500 --> 00:57:24,866
Take it easy. Take it easy.

1017
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:27,433
Here, you're losing
your purse there.

1018
00:57:27,466 --> 00:57:28,933
Thank you.

1019
00:57:28,966 --> 00:57:30,033
I've got you.

1020
00:57:30,833 --> 00:57:31,900
Hi.

1021
00:57:35,066 --> 00:57:37,400
This is a lot of stuff.

1022
00:57:37,433 --> 00:57:38,400
Is she moving in?

1023
00:57:39,300 --> 00:57:42,733
I don't know.
They gave her my room.

1024
00:57:42,766 --> 00:57:44,500
She can't make it upstairs.

1025
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,300
Richard: I've gotcha.
You can't fall.

1026
00:57:51,700 --> 00:57:53,000
I hope I never get that old.

1027
00:57:57,100 --> 00:57:58,966
-Eric: Thank you.
-Man: Thank you.

1028
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,566
Thanks.
Bye bye.

1029
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:03,833
-This is good, this is better.
-Janet: Smooth.

1030
00:58:03,866 --> 00:58:06,900
-Flip it to manual.
-Oh you little stinker, ah!

1031
00:58:08,133 --> 00:58:09,833
Watch this you little rascal.

1032
00:58:09,866 --> 00:58:11,033
Hey, I'm a natural.

1033
00:58:11,833 --> 00:58:13,300
You're not gonna
have to worry about

1034
00:58:13,333 --> 00:58:14,733
pushing me around
when my time comes.

1035
00:58:16,966 --> 00:58:19,266
Don't even joke
about that, Mom.

1036
00:58:19,300 --> 00:58:20,733
I have to, Honey.

1037
00:58:20,766 --> 00:58:21,933
My mother's probably
going to spend

1038
00:58:21,966 --> 00:58:23,600
the rest of her life
in one of these.

1039
00:58:29,466 --> 00:58:31,533
Eric: Okay.

1040
00:58:34,333 --> 00:58:36,666
Now, it's just so
you can go to the park

1041
00:58:36,700 --> 00:58:38,100
on pretty days.

1042
00:58:38,133 --> 00:58:39,866
I'm not a cripple.

1043
00:58:39,900 --> 00:58:41,333
Janet: It's a long way
to the park.

1044
00:58:41,366 --> 00:58:42,800
Two blocks.

1045
00:58:42,833 --> 00:58:47,233
If I can't manage two blocks
what's the point in going?

1046
00:58:47,266 --> 00:58:49,000
Come on, Grandma.

1047
00:58:49,033 --> 00:58:51,000
Let's see what this baby
will do, huh?

1048
00:58:51,033 --> 00:58:52,633
I have things to do.

1049
00:58:56,333 --> 00:58:58,100
Why's she so crabby?

1050
00:58:58,133 --> 00:59:00,366
This is hard for her, Honey.

1051
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:03,033
It's not exactly a
picnic for the rest of us.

1052
00:59:03,066 --> 00:59:08,133
[alarm beeping]

1053
00:59:24,433 --> 00:59:26,733
I didn't sleep last night.

1054
00:59:47,833 --> 00:59:49,533
Go back to sleep, Honey.

1055
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:53,600
I'm just going to take Mom
out for about 15 minutes.

1056
00:59:53,633 --> 00:59:55,566
But I'm awake, Janet.

1057
00:59:55,600 --> 00:59:58,500
I'm awake and I'm awake.

1058
01:00:07,933 --> 01:00:10,866
Janet: Now, why don't
you walk for a minute?

1059
01:00:38,966 --> 01:00:40,233
No.

1060
01:00:41,066 --> 01:00:42,500
I can't.

1061
01:00:57,200 --> 01:00:59,333
Give me a break.

1062
01:00:59,366 --> 01:01:00,600
Sorry.

1063
01:01:18,566 --> 01:01:20,166
What are you doing?

1064
01:01:20,200 --> 01:01:22,200
I'm trying to
get some work done.

1065
01:01:22,233 --> 01:01:23,566
Did you pick up the laundry?

1066
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:25,366
Oh, Hell.

1067
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:26,600
No wonder I couldn't
find my green blouse.

1068
01:01:26,633 --> 01:01:28,900
Okay so crucify me, Janet.

1069
01:01:28,933 --> 01:01:30,966
You've taken care of the
laundry for the last 18 years.

1070
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,066
I'm not used running all
these little errands.

1071
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:38,000
Well you're gonna have
to iron yourself a shirt.

1072
01:01:38,033 --> 01:01:39,766
All right, I can
iron myself a shirt.

1073
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:42,433
-Janet: Good.
-I know how to iron a shirt.

1074
01:01:45,933 --> 01:01:47,366
Morning.

1075
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:49,200
I have a committee meeting
this afternoon, Eric.

1076
01:01:49,233 --> 01:01:51,600
I'd like you to come straight
home from school, okay?

1077
01:01:51,633 --> 01:01:54,266
I have to work on student
council campaign after school.

1078
01:01:54,300 --> 01:01:55,633
Honey, I need
you to take Mom out

1079
01:01:55,666 --> 01:01:57,433
for a few minutes
before it gets dark.

1080
01:01:59,066 --> 01:02:01,600
I can take myself
out on the porch.

1081
01:02:01,633 --> 01:02:03,133
Mother, when I ask
him to do something

1082
01:02:03,166 --> 01:02:04,966
I expect him to do it, okay?

1083
01:02:11,800 --> 01:02:14,200
Eric, don't wolf down
your food like that.

1084
01:02:14,233 --> 01:02:16,400
It's bad for the digestion.

1085
01:02:16,433 --> 01:02:19,333
For God's sake Emily.
The boy's 17 years old.

1086
01:02:19,366 --> 01:02:22,666
Whoa. Since when do we defend
him for eating like a horse?

1087
01:02:33,433 --> 01:02:35,033
Could I see you
for a minute in here?

1088
01:02:48,133 --> 01:02:51,800
Janet, when we decided
to bring your mom here

1089
01:02:51,833 --> 01:02:53,233
we said that we would
make as little change

1090
01:02:53,266 --> 01:02:55,000
in Eric's routine as possible.

1091
01:02:55,033 --> 01:02:57,433
I asked him to take
her out for five minutes.

1092
01:02:57,466 --> 01:02:59,233
Okay. What about us?

1093
01:03:00,266 --> 01:03:02,066
I wish you would understand.
If you would try--

1094
01:03:02,100 --> 01:03:03,966
Honey, we're all trying.

1095
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,900
But it doesn't make sense.
It's not working.

1096
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,233
I will cash in my retirement.

1097
01:03:10,266 --> 01:03:11,633
We can build another room
on the back of the house

1098
01:03:11,666 --> 01:03:13,433
with a bathroom, a big one.

1099
01:03:13,466 --> 01:03:15,166
You know she could have
her own sitting room.

1100
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:16,966
Honey, what if your
mom has a heart attack

1101
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:18,733
or she has a stroke,
or god forbid she falls down

1102
01:03:18,766 --> 01:03:20,600
and breaks her hip again.
Who's going to take care of her?

1103
01:03:20,633 --> 01:03:22,966
-We can't say what will happen.
-She'll need much more

1104
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:24,866
than what you're giving her now.

1105
01:03:24,900 --> 01:03:27,666
-Where will you draw the line?
-That's not up to me.

1106
01:03:27,700 --> 01:03:29,533
Honey, you did not
make your mom old.

1107
01:03:29,566 --> 01:03:32,500
You can't fix it.
You have to accept it.

1108
01:03:32,533 --> 01:03:34,666
But that doesn't give me
the right to throw her away.

1109
01:03:34,700 --> 01:03:37,033
[sigh] Janet,
your mom's miserable.

1110
01:03:37,066 --> 01:03:38,700
She doesn't want Eric's room.

1111
01:03:38,733 --> 01:03:41,433
She doesn't want you waking up
in the morning to bathe her.

1112
01:03:42,766 --> 01:03:44,433
The poor woman has
enough to feel bad about

1113
01:03:44,466 --> 01:03:46,833
without forcing her
to impose on us.

1114
01:03:48,466 --> 01:03:50,866
I will not abandon my mother.

1115
01:03:50,900 --> 01:03:52,400
You really think that
if you sacrifice yourself

1116
01:03:52,433 --> 01:03:54,900
she'll lay a wreath of
laurel on your brow?

1117
01:03:54,933 --> 01:03:56,333
That's not true.

1118
01:03:56,366 --> 01:03:57,700
Richard: You want
to be her favorite.

1119
01:03:57,733 --> 01:04:00,066
This is your last chance

1120
01:04:00,100 --> 01:04:01,833
and you're afraid that if
you force her to face facts

1121
01:04:01,866 --> 01:04:03,566
she'll hold it against you.

1122
01:04:04,566 --> 01:04:06,833
Honey, is it really
worth all of this?

1123
01:04:09,166 --> 01:04:12,100
Be my favorite, hmm?

1124
01:04:23,500 --> 01:04:24,700
Hi, Mom.

1125
01:04:25,866 --> 01:04:27,700
How's everything?

1126
01:04:27,733 --> 01:04:30,033
-Good.
-Eric: That's good.

1127
01:04:31,733 --> 01:04:33,300
Need any help?

1128
01:04:34,466 --> 01:04:36,466
No, I can get it, thank you.

1129
01:04:37,700 --> 01:04:40,233
Mom, you know Tommy's folks?
They're nice people, right?

1130
01:04:40,266 --> 01:04:41,433
Yes, they're very nice.

1131
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:46,833
Well, Tommy's brother is
away at college now

1132
01:04:46,866 --> 01:04:49,433
and they have an extra room

1133
01:04:49,466 --> 01:04:51,100
and his mother said
it would be cool

1134
01:04:51,133 --> 01:04:55,333
if I wanted to sort of
hang out in it for a while.

1135
01:04:56,666 --> 01:04:58,066
Move out?

1136
01:04:58,100 --> 01:05:01,566
Sort of, yeah. I mean
it's just up the street.

1137
01:05:01,600 --> 01:05:02,700
No.

1138
01:05:03,366 --> 01:05:04,700
Please.

1139
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:06,766
I said no.

1140
01:05:15,400 --> 01:05:18,000
Emily: I told you the
swans wouldn't be out.

1141
01:05:18,033 --> 01:05:20,900
Janet: So the swans aren't out.
It's still pretty.

1142
01:05:20,933 --> 01:05:22,400
Emily: It's hot today.

1143
01:05:22,433 --> 01:05:23,866
Janet: Why don't you
take your sweater off?

1144
01:05:23,900 --> 01:05:25,366
Emily: All right.

1145
01:05:25,400 --> 01:05:27,800
Janet: Why don't we sit
and talk for a minute, okay?

1146
01:05:27,833 --> 01:05:30,933
Emily: Maybe I'll
hear from Gladys today.

1147
01:05:30,966 --> 01:05:32,966
I've written her twice.

1148
01:05:34,333 --> 01:05:38,400
Mom, I think it's
time we make some plans.

1149
01:05:39,633 --> 01:05:41,066
Plans?

1150
01:05:41,100 --> 01:05:42,600
Yeah, for you.

1151
01:05:42,633 --> 01:05:44,400
I'm way ahead of you, dear.

1152
01:05:44,433 --> 01:05:47,166
I invited Gladys to
come and live with me.

1153
01:05:48,566 --> 01:05:53,233
I'm sure she's just miserable
in that old age home.

1154
01:05:53,266 --> 01:05:54,833
Selling your father's car

1155
01:05:54,866 --> 01:05:58,100
and using the money
to paint the house.

1156
01:05:58,133 --> 01:06:00,300
I don't think that's
very realistic, Mom.

1157
01:06:00,333 --> 01:06:02,333
That's for me to decide.

1158
01:06:02,366 --> 01:06:04,966
You need more help
than Gladys can give you.

1159
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,366
I'll be the judge
of what I need.

1160
01:06:09,866 --> 01:06:14,200
Mother, you are never
going home to live.

1161
01:06:14,233 --> 01:06:17,633
I know exactly
where this is leading

1162
01:06:17,666 --> 01:06:21,566
and the answer is no.

1163
01:06:21,600 --> 01:06:26,400
I am not living in
some dingy room in a...

1164
01:06:27,433 --> 01:06:32,166
death house
with some sweet sounding name.

1165
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:34,400
I know that you're upset.

1166
01:06:35,433 --> 01:06:39,500
This is difficult but we
need to face some facts.

1167
01:06:39,533 --> 01:06:42,533
You're taking the rest
of my life away from me.

1168
01:06:42,566 --> 01:06:43,933
We're trying to help you.

1169
01:06:43,966 --> 01:06:47,166
Help me?
Right into the next world.

1170
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:48,733
That's not true.

1171
01:06:48,766 --> 01:06:51,233
Then take me home.
And I don't mean your house

1172
01:06:51,266 --> 01:06:54,266
where it's perfectly clear
that I am not welcomed.

1173
01:06:58,400 --> 01:07:00,700
I'm sorry, Janet. I'm sorry.

1174
01:07:00,733 --> 01:07:02,600
I don't want to hurt you.

1175
01:07:02,633 --> 01:07:04,766
I still see what
you're trying to do

1176
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:09,733
but oh my God, my God,
I want to go home.

1177
01:07:09,766 --> 01:07:13,700
I want the rest of my life.

1178
01:07:13,733 --> 01:07:14,700
Please.

1179
01:07:16,933 --> 01:07:18,233
Please.

1180
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:19,900
Let me go home.

1181
01:07:21,366 --> 01:07:22,966
I just can't do that.

1182
01:07:27,800 --> 01:07:29,500
Forty years ago...

1183
01:07:31,566 --> 01:07:33,800
I could have children.

1184
01:07:36,966 --> 01:07:40,300
Twenty years ago I
could read all night

1185
01:07:40,333 --> 01:07:43,733
and get up and teach all day.

1186
01:07:43,766 --> 01:07:47,766
Five years ago I could drive
a car.

1187
01:07:48,833 --> 01:07:52,766
Last Easter I made
dinner as usual

1188
01:07:54,100 --> 01:07:55,533
and now...

1189
01:07:57,433 --> 01:07:59,200
look at me.
I'm...

1190
01:08:00,333 --> 01:08:02,866
You can't understand this.

1191
01:08:03,833 --> 01:08:05,533
And why should you?

1192
01:08:07,466 --> 01:08:08,866
It's like...

1193
01:08:10,433 --> 01:08:11,900
stars...

1194
01:08:13,600 --> 01:08:14,766
going out...

1195
01:08:17,400 --> 01:08:18,766
and I'm in the dark...

1196
01:08:20,266 --> 01:08:21,433
reaching.

1197
01:08:22,100 --> 01:08:24,366
My God, it's all unraveling.

1198
01:08:25,533 --> 01:08:26,900
Oh my God.

1199
01:08:27,800 --> 01:08:29,300
I can't stop.

1200
01:08:30,233 --> 01:08:34,333
Mom, I'm gonna be
right here with you.

1201
01:08:34,366 --> 01:08:36,500
I'm gonna be right here.

1202
01:09:13,400 --> 01:09:15,266
-Janet: Hi.
-Rob: Same to you.

1203
01:09:15,300 --> 01:09:16,600
You look good.

1204
01:09:16,633 --> 01:09:18,666
What's this Mom's telling
me about a nursing home?

1205
01:09:18,700 --> 01:09:20,833
Yeah well, I've looked at a few.

1206
01:09:20,866 --> 01:09:23,333
The ones I like
are so exorbitant.

1207
01:09:23,366 --> 01:09:25,266
I know, but a
nursing home, Janet...

1208
01:09:25,300 --> 01:09:27,200
That's pretty drastic.

1209
01:09:27,233 --> 01:09:31,400
I know but I can't
take care of her anymore.

1210
01:09:31,433 --> 01:09:33,333
She can't take care of herself.

1211
01:09:36,566 --> 01:09:38,466
When did she start
using the chair?

1212
01:09:38,500 --> 01:09:40,500
She doesn't need
it all the time.

1213
01:09:40,533 --> 01:09:42,366
-She looks so--
-She's okay.

1214
01:09:42,400 --> 01:09:44,800
Emily: Rob! Hello, Rob.

1215
01:09:44,833 --> 01:09:45,933
Hi Mom.

1216
01:09:47,133 --> 01:09:49,433
-Emily: Oh.
-Rob: Oh!

1217
01:09:49,466 --> 01:09:51,066
How are ya?

1218
01:09:51,100 --> 01:09:52,633
Is that jacket warm enough?

1219
01:09:52,666 --> 01:09:54,366
It's fine.

1220
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:55,766
I say it's a little
chilly out here.

1221
01:09:55,800 --> 01:09:57,966
-I think I'll take Mom inside.
-Okay, I'll be right in.

1222
01:09:58,000 --> 01:09:59,100
All right, Good.

1223
01:10:04,966 --> 01:10:05,900
My God.

1224
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:09,333
She's very excited
about your visit.

1225
01:10:09,366 --> 01:10:10,333
Thank you.

1226
01:10:12,833 --> 01:10:14,133
What is it?

1227
01:10:14,166 --> 01:10:15,333
She's so...

1228
01:10:15,366 --> 01:10:17,400
Janet: Old. I know.

1229
01:10:17,433 --> 01:10:19,033
It happened so suddenly.

1230
01:10:19,066 --> 01:10:20,400
Yeah.

1231
01:10:20,433 --> 01:10:22,366
I can't take care
of her anymore.

1232
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:27,333
Yeah, I know, but a home?
Poor Mom.

1233
01:10:27,366 --> 01:10:29,333
It's the best thing.

1234
01:10:29,366 --> 01:10:30,633
Yeah.

1235
01:10:32,033 --> 01:10:35,200
I just take it all
for granted, you know?

1236
01:10:35,233 --> 01:10:38,000
Don't have any food at my place,
come over to Mom's.

1237
01:10:40,033 --> 01:10:44,100
A little short of cash,
Mom'll bail me out.

1238
01:10:44,133 --> 01:10:46,300
The laundry piles up,
she'll give me a hand.

1239
01:10:49,066 --> 01:10:51,333
I've never really
left home, have I?

1240
01:10:55,466 --> 01:10:57,400
Well, maybe it's
time to buy a washer.

1241
01:10:59,200 --> 01:11:00,600
Yeah, or marry one.

1242
01:11:00,633 --> 01:11:03,466
God, you're hopeless.
Hopeless.

1243
01:11:05,500 --> 01:11:07,733
Woman: We can put
her on the waiting list.

1244
01:11:07,766 --> 01:11:10,966
Well, the one place I like
is very expensive.

1245
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,166
Would Medicaid pay part of it?

1246
01:11:13,200 --> 01:11:15,866
No, Medicaid covers
basic nursing home care

1247
01:11:15,900 --> 01:11:18,533
for people who have
very little resources.

1248
01:11:18,566 --> 01:11:21,266
Woman: You said your mother has
some money and some assets.

1249
01:11:21,300 --> 01:11:23,433
Yeah, but she's not rich.

1250
01:11:24,466 --> 01:11:26,966
What about health insurance?

1251
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:28,100
Medicare.

1252
01:11:28,700 --> 01:11:29,966
Medicare isn't much help

1253
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:33,366
if she ever needs a
long term hospital stay.

1254
01:11:33,400 --> 01:11:35,133
Well, what do you suggest?

1255
01:11:36,233 --> 01:11:39,500
See if her church sponsors
any type of elder care.

1256
01:11:39,533 --> 01:11:41,200
Most of them do.

1257
01:11:41,233 --> 01:11:43,733
If she were childless
or destitute

1258
01:11:43,766 --> 01:11:45,500
I'd have a lot more to offer.

1259
01:11:45,533 --> 01:11:48,933
Unfortunately, we live in a
society that leaves elder care

1260
01:11:48,966 --> 01:11:50,500
to the nearest living daughter.

1261
01:11:51,566 --> 01:11:53,800
I'll check with the church.

1262
01:11:54,700 --> 01:11:55,733
Thank you.

1263
01:11:57,033 --> 01:11:58,700
What are you doing?

1264
01:12:00,133 --> 01:12:02,066
Polishing silverware.

1265
01:12:08,066 --> 01:12:09,200
Mom.

1266
01:12:11,133 --> 01:12:13,400
I saw the most
wonderful place today.

1267
01:12:13,433 --> 01:12:14,866
It belongs to the church.

1268
01:12:15,966 --> 01:12:18,633
I really think it's the one.

1269
01:12:18,666 --> 01:12:20,533
It's just beautiful.

1270
01:12:21,733 --> 01:12:23,200
We can give them a lump sum

1271
01:12:23,233 --> 01:12:26,433
from the sale of your house

1272
01:12:26,466 --> 01:12:28,066
and they'll guarantee
all your expenses

1273
01:12:28,100 --> 01:12:29,233
for the rest of your life.

1274
01:12:30,433 --> 01:12:32,066
Is there a room
in the basement

1275
01:12:32,100 --> 01:12:34,433
where you sit and glue
scenes from nature

1276
01:12:34,466 --> 01:12:37,533
into conch shells that light up?

1277
01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:43,133
I'm going to take you
to see it on Saturday.

1278
01:12:45,533 --> 01:12:48,733
I have to teach at 1:00,
so if you need anything

1279
01:12:48,766 --> 01:12:51,033
I will be in my
office after 2:30.

1280
01:12:55,500 --> 01:13:00,033
[birds singing]

1281
01:13:04,166 --> 01:13:06,466
Janet: Impressive, isn't it?

1282
01:13:06,500 --> 01:13:08,533
Emily: You said
it was pleasant.

1283
01:13:08,566 --> 01:13:10,033
Janet: It's very pleasant.

1284
01:13:11,733 --> 01:13:13,266
Where's the dungeon?

1285
01:13:17,866 --> 01:13:20,333
We call this the sun room.

1286
01:13:20,366 --> 01:13:24,800
You can read, write letters,
or just rest if you want.

1287
01:13:32,366 --> 01:13:36,400
We have all kinds of
lectures and musical events.

1288
01:13:38,066 --> 01:13:40,300
A lot of our residents
play instruments.

1289
01:13:41,633 --> 01:13:45,033
Janet tells me you play
the piano, Mrs. Miller.

1290
01:13:45,066 --> 01:13:48,600
Oh, my husband was the
musician in the family.

1291
01:13:49,933 --> 01:13:54,333
Oh, Catherine, this is Emily.

1292
01:13:54,366 --> 01:13:57,400
Oh, I hear that
you're a bridge player.

1293
01:13:57,433 --> 01:13:59,933
Not for years now dear.

1294
01:13:59,966 --> 01:14:02,866
Catherine's writing
a book, on uh...

1295
01:14:02,900 --> 01:14:04,600
What's it on, Catherine?

1296
01:14:04,633 --> 01:14:09,066
Innate differences
between men and women.

1297
01:14:15,366 --> 01:14:18,466
All the art you see is
done by the residents.

1298
01:14:18,500 --> 01:14:22,166
We have a painting studio
and a woodworking room.

1299
01:14:22,200 --> 01:14:26,566
In fact, we put on quite
a crafts fair every fall.

1300
01:14:26,600 --> 01:14:29,933
The residents rooms are
on the second floor.

1301
01:14:29,966 --> 01:14:32,300
Well, I can't manage stairs.

1302
01:14:32,333 --> 01:14:34,066
Then let's take the elevator.

1303
01:14:34,100 --> 01:14:38,666
Well I have a million
things to do at home.

1304
01:14:38,700 --> 01:14:41,700
Would you rather
come back another time?

1305
01:14:41,733 --> 01:14:42,433
-Yes.
-No.

1306
01:14:43,566 --> 01:14:45,833
All our residents are here
because they choose to be.

1307
01:14:47,966 --> 01:14:51,033
I've never taken anyone
against his wishes.

1308
01:14:51,066 --> 01:14:53,066
Have you really
thought this over?

1309
01:14:54,133 --> 01:14:56,433
May we please
just see the rooms?

1310
01:14:56,466 --> 01:14:58,100
Is that all right
with you, Mrs. Miller?

1311
01:15:00,733 --> 01:15:03,600
Oh, all right.

1312
01:15:09,866 --> 01:15:11,600
[ringing]

1313
01:15:13,733 --> 01:15:17,466
-Ruth: Hello?
-Ruthie, it's me, Em.

1314
01:15:17,500 --> 01:15:21,300
Ruth: Emily. 
It's good to hear your voice.

1315
01:15:21,333 --> 01:15:23,366
We've got a new librarian.

1316
01:15:23,400 --> 01:15:26,333
He wants everything on computer.

1317
01:15:26,366 --> 01:15:28,666
I told him this morning,
I said,

1318
01:15:28,700 --> 01:15:31,566
"You're not going to
computerize me, Buster."

1319
01:15:32,600 --> 01:15:36,933
I was thinking of
coming to visit you.

1320
01:15:36,966 --> 01:15:40,500
Oh, well.
Not just now, Em.

1321
01:15:40,533 --> 01:15:43,466
They want to put me away.

1322
01:15:44,600 --> 01:15:49,800
I thought maybe if I got out
of their hair for a while.

1323
01:15:49,833 --> 01:15:51,200
Ruth: I've got Gladys here.

1324
01:15:52,333 --> 01:15:56,133
Emily: I've written her 
twice, she never answered.

1325
01:15:56,166 --> 01:15:59,866
Well, her daughter
has all those kids.

1326
01:15:59,900 --> 01:16:03,000
And they kicked her out
of that retirement place.

1327
01:16:03,033 --> 01:16:05,400
Emily: Kicked her out?

1328
01:16:05,433 --> 01:16:07,066
They found Alzheimers.

1329
01:16:07,100 --> 01:16:10,033
That place won't keep
people with Alzheimers.

1330
01:16:10,066 --> 01:16:11,866
Well, that settles it.

1331
01:16:11,900 --> 01:16:16,000
I'm going home and Gladys
is coming to live with me.

1332
01:16:16,033 --> 01:16:20,466
Ruth: Oh, no Em. 
You don't understand.

1333
01:16:20,500 --> 01:16:23,800
She almost burned
the place down.

1334
01:16:23,833 --> 01:16:26,500
We're trying to find
something for her.

1335
01:16:26,533 --> 01:16:28,266
-I don't know--
-Who is it?

1336
01:16:29,600 --> 01:16:32,166
I have to watch
her every minute.

1337
01:16:32,200 --> 01:16:33,133
She's in and out.

1338
01:16:34,200 --> 01:16:37,766
I have to unplug my stove
when I leave for work.

1339
01:16:37,800 --> 01:16:39,133
Who is it?

1340
01:16:39,166 --> 01:16:40,666
It's Emily.

1341
01:16:40,700 --> 01:16:41,666
Emily!

1342
01:16:44,400 --> 01:16:45,500
Em?

1343
01:16:45,533 --> 01:16:47,200
Hello Gladys.

1344
01:16:47,233 --> 01:16:49,166
Oh, Em.

1345
01:16:51,200 --> 01:16:53,066
It's very bad.

1346
01:16:53,100 --> 01:16:55,066
Ruthie yells at me.

1347
01:16:56,100 --> 01:16:58,366
Are you coming home?

1348
01:16:58,400 --> 01:17:01,000
Gladys, tell me.

1349
01:17:01,033 --> 01:17:02,766
What happened?

1350
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:07,400
Well I just couldn't
get used to it.

1351
01:17:07,433 --> 01:17:12,266
It was so different
and they had so many rules.

1352
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,433
I left a pot on the stove.

1353
01:17:17,166 --> 01:17:18,133
Gladys: Twice.

1354
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:21,833
They say I'm crazy.

1355
01:17:22,533 --> 01:17:25,266
You're coming to live with me

1356
01:17:25,300 --> 01:17:28,500
and we'll get someone
to come in part time.

1357
01:17:28,533 --> 01:17:30,233
Oh yes, Honey.

1358
01:17:30,266 --> 01:17:31,533
Yes I--

1359
01:17:31,566 --> 01:17:32,266
Gladys?

1360
01:17:33,166 --> 01:17:36,500
Don't talk to me
like I'm a damned dog!

1361
01:17:36,533 --> 01:17:37,600
What?

1362
01:17:38,300 --> 01:17:39,300
Oh.

1363
01:17:41,700 --> 01:17:42,966
Who is this?

1364
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:46,533
Emily: Gladys, it's Emily.

1365
01:17:48,333 --> 01:17:53,266
Well, see what Henny says.

1366
01:18:00,366 --> 01:18:02,600
Em, she runs away.

1367
01:18:03,666 --> 01:18:06,733
I'm trying to get the
county to take her.

1368
01:18:06,766 --> 01:18:08,366
Don't tell her that.

1369
01:18:08,400 --> 01:18:11,600
Don't you tell her that!
What?

1370
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:15,700
Gladys: Who... 
Who are you talking to?

1371
01:18:15,733 --> 01:18:17,966
Who are you talking to?

1372
01:18:18,666 --> 01:18:20,366
Go on into your room.

1373
01:18:20,400 --> 01:18:21,566
Ruth: Now just go!

1374
01:18:27,266 --> 01:18:32,666
I keep calling her daughter
but she won't come and get her.

1375
01:18:32,700 --> 01:18:35,366
I hate to put her
on the county, Em.

1376
01:18:36,666 --> 01:18:39,300
But it's all I can do to
keep going, you know?

1377
01:18:41,466 --> 01:18:46,100
Why use up the last bit of
strength you have to fight it?

1378
01:18:46,133 --> 01:18:47,533
I mean,

1379
01:18:48,566 --> 01:18:51,500
what did we think it
would be like at our age?

1380
01:18:55,200 --> 01:18:56,866
Sunsets?

1381
01:18:57,466 --> 01:18:59,700
You can't stop that.

1382
01:19:01,633 --> 01:19:03,000
What can we do, Ruthie?

1383
01:19:03,033 --> 01:19:05,633
Ruthie, what can we do?

1384
01:19:05,666 --> 01:19:08,366
Oh I don't know, I don't know.

1385
01:19:11,800 --> 01:19:13,133
Why don't you walk
a little bit, Mom?

1386
01:19:13,166 --> 01:19:14,866
It'll be good for ya.

1387
01:19:14,900 --> 01:19:16,566
No, not today.

1388
01:19:18,366 --> 01:19:20,233
You know, we are very lucky.

1389
01:19:20,266 --> 01:19:22,066
Some people have to wait years

1390
01:19:22,100 --> 01:19:24,433
to get into a place
like the McLinden Home.

1391
01:19:24,466 --> 01:19:27,166
I'm trying very hard
to see it that way.

1392
01:19:27,200 --> 01:19:29,000
Well, try harder.

1393
01:19:29,033 --> 01:19:32,533
Well, maybe I'll get lucky
and die before I have to go.

1394
01:19:36,300 --> 01:19:37,366
Janet?

1395
01:19:37,966 --> 01:19:39,900
I want to go back now.

1396
01:19:39,933 --> 01:19:41,300
You know how to
work that thing.

1397
01:19:42,366 --> 01:19:43,900
No I don't, I forgot.

1398
01:19:43,933 --> 01:19:45,133
Well, walk.

1399
01:19:45,700 --> 01:19:47,800
No. I can't.

1400
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:56,200
I have done everything
I know how to do for you.

1401
01:19:56,233 --> 01:20:00,200
I have helped you in every
way I can possibly think of.

1402
01:20:00,233 --> 01:20:01,433
But you just sit there.

1403
01:20:01,466 --> 01:20:04,400
You sit in that chair
and you give up.

1404
01:20:04,433 --> 01:20:05,966
You've just given up.

1405
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:07,466
Well I'm sorry.

1406
01:20:07,500 --> 01:20:09,466
-Do you love me?
-What?

1407
01:20:09,500 --> 01:20:10,900
-Do you love me?
-Janet, please.

1408
01:20:10,933 --> 01:20:13,033
-Answer me.
-Of course I love you.

1409
01:20:13,066 --> 01:20:14,933
Then why have you made
this so difficult for me?

1410
01:20:14,966 --> 01:20:16,166
I don't know--

1411
01:20:16,200 --> 01:20:18,133
Why have I spent
my whole adult life

1412
01:20:18,166 --> 01:20:19,533
trying to get you to notice me?

1413
01:20:19,566 --> 01:20:22,200
You stopped
needing me long ago.

1414
01:20:22,233 --> 01:20:26,033
No!
I will always need you.

1415
01:20:26,066 --> 01:20:27,733
Don't you get that?

1416
01:20:27,766 --> 01:20:29,966
Well, look what's ahead for me.

1417
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:31,200
I am.

1418
01:20:31,233 --> 01:20:34,166
I'm looking straight ahead
and I see it.

1419
01:20:34,200 --> 01:20:36,100
Every time I look
at you I see it.

1420
01:20:36,133 --> 01:20:38,533
That's why every single
moment we have together

1421
01:20:38,566 --> 01:20:40,833
is so very precious to me.

1422
01:20:40,866 --> 01:20:44,000
Janet, at night when I
go to bed I close my eyes

1423
01:20:44,033 --> 01:20:48,333
and I try to let myself go.

1424
01:20:48,366 --> 01:20:51,133
I say to myself,
"It's okay, Emily.

1425
01:20:51,166 --> 01:20:52,566
It's okay, just
let yourself go."

1426
01:20:52,600 --> 01:20:55,566
And I go farther
and farther away

1427
01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:58,033
and it seems the
most natural thing.

1428
01:20:58,066 --> 01:21:01,266
But then in the morning
when I'm still here

1429
01:21:01,300 --> 01:21:06,300
I know I'm going to keep trying
to let myself go!

1430
01:21:06,333 --> 01:21:07,633
Fine.

1431
01:21:08,833 --> 01:21:10,000
Janet.

1432
01:21:10,700 --> 01:21:13,900
Janet, I'm afraid.

1433
01:21:13,933 --> 01:21:18,000
I'm afraid of what
is waiting for me

1434
01:21:18,033 --> 01:21:20,866
between now and dying!

1435
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:27,100
Because underneath it
all I want to go on.

1436
01:21:27,133 --> 01:21:28,666
I, I, I...

1437
01:21:29,633 --> 01:21:31,000
I want to go on and on.

1438
01:21:31,033 --> 01:21:33,000
Well, then, let's go.

1439
01:21:34,300 --> 01:21:35,500
Let's go.

1440
01:22:15,766 --> 01:22:19,100
Well this is all
very fine inlaid wood.

1441
01:22:19,133 --> 01:22:20,100
Five hundred.

1442
01:22:22,066 --> 01:22:23,633
Two thousand.

1443
01:22:23,666 --> 01:22:26,733
It's gonna cost me a couple
hundred to get it refinished.

1444
01:22:26,766 --> 01:22:28,100
This is all
handcrafted, you know.

1445
01:22:28,133 --> 01:22:29,466
We're giving it away as it is.

1446
01:22:29,500 --> 01:22:31,500
-Yes.
-All right, 1,000.

1447
01:22:32,600 --> 01:22:37,333
Janet, your father brought
that home from an auction.

1448
01:22:37,366 --> 01:22:39,666
I always hated it.
Let them have it.

1449
01:22:42,566 --> 01:22:44,733
You advertised a freezer?

1450
01:22:44,766 --> 01:22:46,533
Yes, I did.
It's right in here.

1451
01:22:47,666 --> 01:22:48,866
It's yours.

1452
01:23:24,700 --> 01:23:27,000
I wish it were a ring, Em.

1453
01:23:29,300 --> 01:23:30,500
I love it.

1454
01:23:31,666 --> 01:23:33,200
I'll keep it forever.

1455
01:23:34,433 --> 01:23:36,266
Nothing lasts forever.

1456
01:23:53,100 --> 01:23:55,200
-Hi.
-Here, I'll do that.

1457
01:23:55,233 --> 01:23:56,800
Oh, it's okay,
I'm almost finished.

1458
01:23:58,900 --> 01:24:00,166
How is she?

1459
01:24:01,433 --> 01:24:06,066
Well, I think she's
doing fine, actually.

1460
01:24:06,100 --> 01:24:08,400
-How are you doing?
-Me? I'm fine.

1461
01:24:09,566 --> 01:24:11,600
I have a dustpan
around here just--

1462
01:24:11,633 --> 01:24:12,700
Janet.

1463
01:24:14,900 --> 01:24:16,066
Thank you for...

1464
01:24:17,733 --> 01:24:19,800
taking such good
care of our mother.

1465
01:24:21,300 --> 01:24:23,400
Rob, you're here.

1466
01:24:25,300 --> 01:24:26,400
Hi Mom.

1467
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:32,533
Would you mind helping Richard

1468
01:24:32,566 --> 01:24:33,766
in the basement
for a little while?

1469
01:24:33,800 --> 01:24:35,133
I have to take Mom
to the cemetery.

1470
01:24:35,166 --> 01:24:36,966
Well, I'll take her.

1471
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:38,033
No.

1472
01:24:38,633 --> 01:24:40,566
No, Janet can take me.

1473
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:50,433
[birds singing]

1474
01:24:57,366 --> 01:24:58,400
Now then.

1475
01:24:59,433 --> 01:25:00,633
Where's Henny?

1476
01:25:00,666 --> 01:25:02,533
It's over here.
Over this way.

1477
01:25:03,866 --> 01:25:06,533
You won't come
here after I'm gone.

1478
01:25:06,566 --> 01:25:07,900
Of course I will.

1479
01:25:07,933 --> 01:25:08,966
No you won't.

1480
01:25:10,866 --> 01:25:12,266
And I don't want you to.

1481
01:25:12,933 --> 01:25:14,600
Oh, yes you do.

1482
01:25:16,066 --> 01:25:18,300
I know you think
I'm old and funny.

1483
01:25:18,333 --> 01:25:19,966
Well, you are old and funny.

1484
01:25:20,733 --> 01:25:21,800
Dearest child...

1485
01:25:24,300 --> 01:25:26,133
don't ever wonder if I love you.

1486
01:25:27,200 --> 01:25:30,033
I wouldn't be standing
here if it weren't for you.

1487
01:25:32,766 --> 01:25:35,733
Well, I wouldn't be standing
here if it weren't for you.

1488
01:25:37,566 --> 01:25:39,833
We taught you how to fly

1489
01:25:39,866 --> 01:25:41,866
and off you flew.

1490
01:25:41,900 --> 01:25:43,566
And I thank you for that, Mom.

1491
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:51,866
That McLinden House.

1492
01:25:51,900 --> 01:25:53,033
Home.

1493
01:25:53,800 --> 01:25:56,266
I'm going to give it my best.

1494
01:25:56,300 --> 01:25:59,833
I'm still good for a
few hands of Bridge.

1495
01:25:59,866 --> 01:26:03,166
And I never had the time to
read the way I wanted to.

1496
01:26:04,933 --> 01:26:09,066
But what you said
about our time together,

1497
01:26:09,100 --> 01:26:11,333
I want that most of all.

1498
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:13,433
Oh, Mom.

1499
01:26:17,500 --> 01:26:19,433
Your brother still needs you.

1500
01:26:20,366 --> 01:26:21,700
He just does.

1501
01:26:22,600 --> 01:26:25,366
-Stay in touch.
-I will, I will.

1502
01:26:28,833 --> 01:26:29,966
But listen.

1503
01:26:30,700 --> 01:26:32,600
And only because
it's on my mind.

1504
01:26:33,666 --> 01:26:37,866
You'll bury me in my blue satin
winter or summer.

1505
01:26:37,900 --> 01:26:39,266
I promise.

1506
01:26:39,300 --> 01:26:41,666
-And no lace.
-Promise.

1507
01:26:41,700 --> 01:26:44,666
Please be sure to show
them what to do with my hair.

1508
01:26:44,700 --> 01:26:46,233
We've been over
this twice already.

1509
01:26:46,266 --> 01:26:49,200
And in the summer,
I don't care if I'm in a coma,

1510
01:26:49,233 --> 01:26:51,833
you and Richard are
going to Europe.

1511
01:26:51,866 --> 01:26:53,300
God you're bossy.

1512
01:26:54,533 --> 01:26:58,066
There'll be plenty of money left
from the sale of the house.

1513
01:26:58,100 --> 01:26:59,466
We'll think about it, okay?

1514
01:27:00,733 --> 01:27:07,233
Oh, that Ruthie
and her damn plastic flowers!

1515

I'm gonna take off, Ma.

1517
01:27:21,233 --> 01:27:22,866
I'll be up to see
you in a week or two.

your laundry, dear.

anything you call me, okay?

You do the same.

Just one minute.

were surrounded by Germans
