1
00:00:37,838 --> 00:00:39,800
I can't hide it any longer

2
00:00:40,521 --> 00:00:42,923
How I regretted for all these

3
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:45,165
I've lived in shame

4
00:00:45,285 --> 00:00:46,847
but, today...

5
00:00:46,967 --> 00:00:48,488
I can't face myself any longer

6
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:52,012
Lin Qiuhua, 21 years old

7
00:00:52,092 --> 00:00:54,254
A typist of
The Far East Insurance Company

8
00:00:54,935 --> 00:00:57,177
Upon initial investigation,
occupational neurasthenia

9
00:00:57,297 --> 00:00:59,459
Could be the cause of her suicide

10
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:00,701
Did she leave behind any note?

11
00:01:00,821 --> 00:01:01,902
No

12
00:01:02,022 --> 00:01:05,586
but there's not a hint of
struggle at the scene

13
00:01:05,866 --> 00:01:07,708
Her fingerprints are there
on the windowsill

14
00:01:08,268 --> 00:01:09,670
There's no sign of any kind of struggle

15
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:13,313
All these conform
to the report of the witnesses

16
00:01:14,434 --> 00:01:16,036
That's all for today's report

17
00:01:16,156 --> 00:01:17,477
Good, thanks

18
00:01:17,598 --> 00:01:18,318
A typist?

19
00:01:18,438 --> 00:01:20,080
Commits suicide because of
occupational neurasthenia

20
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,722
There's no news value at all

21
00:01:26,727 --> 00:01:28,488
Section Chief, Miss Lin Hongzhu is here

22
00:01:28,769 --> 00:01:29,690
I have taken her to the autopsy

23
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:30,971
There's no doubt that it's her sister

24
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:32,052
Good, bring her in

25
00:01:32,172 --> 00:01:32,853
Yes

26
00:01:35,696 --> 00:01:36,617
Please come in

27
00:01:39,499 --> 00:01:40,220
Have a seat

28
00:01:45,666 --> 00:01:48,228
I'm very sorry for your sister

29
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:51,311
May I ask if she was engaged?

30
00:01:51,832 --> 00:01:53,433
She wasn't

31
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:55,756
Did you notice her behavior lately

32
00:01:55,876 --> 00:01:57,678
Or where she usually hung out?

33
00:01:58,078 --> 00:01:59,119
I didn't pay attention to that

34
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,481
Has she ever stayed out even for a night?

35
00:02:01,602 --> 00:02:02,482
Never

36
00:02:03,644 --> 00:02:04,565
There was this once though

37
00:02:04,685 --> 00:02:05,646
When was that?

38
00:02:06,166 --> 00:02:07,568
About six months ago

39
00:02:07,688 --> 00:02:09,409
When she met her first boyfriend

40
00:02:09,489 --> 00:02:10,531
What's his name?

41
00:02:12,653 --> 00:02:13,493
You have no idea?

42
00:02:14,615 --> 00:02:15,736
I'd better be honest with you

43
00:02:15,856 --> 00:02:16,977
Your sister was pregnant

44
00:02:17,938 --> 00:02:19,660
been carrying for six months

45
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:23,103
I'd think that's
the main cause for her suicide

46
00:02:24,064 --> 00:02:26,827
We didn't give out the truth

47
00:02:26,907 --> 00:02:29,109
For the sake of your sister's honor

48
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:33,313
Can you give us any kind of clue?

49
00:02:33,433 --> 00:02:35,035
I hope you can tell us what happened,
like...

50
00:02:35,115 --> 00:02:37,678
between your sister and her boyfriend

51
00:02:38,278 --> 00:02:39,720
That man is not her boyfriend

52
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,642
He is some other man

53
00:02:43,123 --> 00:02:44,925
My sister slept with a man

54
00:02:45,045 --> 00:02:47,047
Only once in her lifetime

55
00:02:47,808 --> 00:02:48,969
but she didn't even

56
00:02:49,089 --> 00:02:51,091
Know his name

57
00:02:52,052 --> 00:02:54,334
I only came to know all this
by reading her diary

58
00:02:55,095 --> 00:02:56,016
She's so silly

59
00:02:56,496 --> 00:02:58,939
I mean,
how could she sleep with someone...

60
00:02:59,059 --> 00:03:00,340
She has metjust once!

61
00:03:01,061 --> 00:03:02,583
Can I take a look

62
00:03:02,663 --> 00:03:03,624
At your sister's diary?

63
00:03:04,865 --> 00:03:06,466
I've burnt it

64
00:04:36,196 --> 00:04:39,119
June 10, Lin Qiuhua committed suicide

65
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:42,402
because of occupational neurasthenia

66
00:04:43,684 --> 00:04:45,686
This happened six months after I met her

67
00:04:46,246 --> 00:04:48,208
I am writing this down as a memoir to her

68
00:04:57,097 --> 00:04:59,219
Excuse me, I'd like to inquire about

69
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:00,661
Two guests who stayed here some time back

70
00:05:00,781 --> 00:05:01,461
Can I?

71
00:05:01,582 --> 00:05:02,462
Well...

72
00:05:04,264 --> 00:05:06,226
That was six months ago

73
00:05:06,346 --> 00:05:08,028
A young couple came here one night

74
00:05:08,468 --> 00:05:09,910
This is the picture of that young lady

75
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:11,431
Can you look up for me

76
00:05:11,512 --> 00:05:12,753
Their registered names

77
00:05:12,873 --> 00:05:14,034
I'm sorry

78
00:05:14,114 --> 00:05:16,637
We have many guests
coming in and out each day

79
00:05:16,717 --> 00:05:18,879
And six months is such a long time

80
00:05:22,202 --> 00:05:23,203
Thank you

81
00:05:29,009 --> 00:05:29,890
Can I talk to you

82
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:30,811
Sure

83
00:05:42,142 --> 00:05:43,223
What is it that you want?

84
00:05:43,503 --> 00:05:45,706
I want to know about a young couple

85
00:05:45,826 --> 00:05:47,628
...who stayed here six months ago

86
00:05:47,708 --> 00:05:50,430
The man drove here in his big,
grand automobile

87
00:05:50,591 --> 00:05:52,953
He's a tall guy, about 30 years old

88
00:05:53,874 --> 00:05:55,155
He could be one of your old customers

89
00:05:55,475 --> 00:05:56,476
One of our old customers?

90
00:05:56,757 --> 00:05:58,118
This is the picture of the lady

91
00:05:58,238 --> 00:06:00,360
very slim, short hair

92
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,802
A bit shy

93
00:06:02,482 --> 00:06:04,525
I remember now, it could be Mr. Zhou

94
00:06:04,645 --> 00:06:05,846
Mr. Zhou?

95
00:06:05,966 --> 00:06:06,767
It could be him

96
00:06:07,327 --> 00:06:08,328
During summer...

97
00:06:08,448 --> 00:06:10,611
He often brought his girlfriends here

98
00:06:10,851 --> 00:06:12,012
He has a gorgeous car

99
00:06:12,092 --> 00:06:13,173
With a blue license plate

100
00:06:13,293 --> 00:06:14,214
Yes

101
00:06:14,494 --> 00:06:16,657
but, he may have changed his car now

102
00:06:16,737 --> 00:06:18,939
I heard he's in the automobile business

103
00:06:19,059 --> 00:06:21,221
He owns gas stations
and a car-dealing company

104
00:06:22,422 --> 00:06:23,183
Thank you so much

105
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:53,774
Hello. Yes, hold on

106
00:06:55,696 --> 00:06:58,418
Mr. Lee, someone is here
for the General Manager

107
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:01,221
Excuse me, I've a call

108
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:10,350
This is Li Donghai. Who am I speaking to?

109
00:07:11,992 --> 00:07:14,474
The GM is not in his office,
anything important?

110
00:07:14,595 --> 00:07:16,637
I'd like to ask his opinion
about something

111
00:07:16,757 --> 00:07:19,199
Can you give me his home address

112
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:21,081
And let me meet with his wife

113
00:07:21,201 --> 00:07:21,842
What?

114
00:07:22,923 --> 00:07:24,685
Our GM is still single

115
00:07:25,365 --> 00:07:27,007
And he always stays in a hotel

116
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:31,652
The Palace Hotel

117
00:07:32,212 --> 00:07:34,374
We are calling from the Jet Airlines

118
00:07:34,494 --> 00:07:35,295
Can you give me the room number of...

119
00:07:35,415 --> 00:07:37,297
Mr. Zhou Guoxiong

120
00:07:37,377 --> 00:07:40,300
Mr. Zhou stays in room 305

121
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:53,393
Yes, he comes back
around 12 p.m. Everyday

122
00:07:54,915 --> 00:07:56,156
Who are you?

123
00:07:58,078 --> 00:07:59,279
May I have your phone number?

124
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,401
And I'll ask him to call you back

125
00:08:02,122 --> 00:08:02,883
It doesn't matter

126
00:08:05,806 --> 00:08:07,848
Mr. Zhou, someone called you just now

127
00:08:07,968 --> 00:08:10,450
As you said,
I told her that you'll be back late

128
00:08:10,531 --> 00:08:12,853
She hung up when I asked for her name

129
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:39,399
Xiulan, you are becoming ever so gorgeous

130
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:40,200
Really?

131
00:08:41,281 --> 00:08:42,122
Thanks

132
00:08:42,803 --> 00:08:44,965
You are the only one
who knew of my returning

133
00:08:45,726 --> 00:08:47,528
At first I planned to stay in Japan
for another year

134
00:08:47,648 --> 00:08:48,529
One more year?

135
00:08:48,649 --> 00:08:50,170
Don't get anxious; on seeing you...

136
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:51,852
I think I'll give it a second thought

137
00:09:21,001 --> 00:09:22,082
Lady, you're back

138
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:26,406
I know you wouldn't want to meet
with my mom

139
00:09:26,887 --> 00:09:28,328
My mom said it seems that...

140
00:09:28,448 --> 00:09:30,450
You're not very interested in
doing business

141
00:09:30,811 --> 00:09:32,092
May be she likes Li Donghai

142
00:09:32,212 --> 00:09:33,293
I for one don't like him one bit

143
00:09:33,614 --> 00:09:35,656
I felt uneasy whenever I saw him

144
00:09:38,579 --> 00:09:39,820
I'll call you later

145
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:41,181
Goodbye

146
00:09:45,465 --> 00:09:46,426
See you

147
00:09:54,354 --> 00:09:56,637
I hear Miss Xiulan is coming back soon,
is it?

148
00:09:56,717 --> 00:09:58,999
Yes! Actually she should be settled down

149
00:09:59,079 --> 00:10:00,801
Xiulan should not go to study in Japan

150
00:10:00,881 --> 00:10:02,523
being so far away

151
00:10:02,643 --> 00:10:03,003
Let you...

152
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:04,044
Mom

153
00:10:04,444 --> 00:10:05,365
I'm back

154
00:10:06,406 --> 00:10:07,287
Xiulan

155
00:10:09,409 --> 00:10:10,370
You're back

156
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:11,612
Mom, this is for you

157
00:10:12,252 --> 00:10:13,774
You are nice to me

158
00:10:14,855 --> 00:10:16,376
How come you
didn't inform me of your return?

159
00:10:16,496 --> 00:10:18,018
I'd have sent someone to pick you up

160
00:10:18,098 --> 00:10:19,379
Oh, thought I'd make it a surprise

161
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:23,664
You're so naughty.
Let me look at you carefully

162
00:10:27,668 --> 00:10:29,990
Miss Xiulan,
you're more and more beautiful

163
00:10:33,393 --> 00:10:35,916
The future belongs to young people
like you two

164
00:10:36,036 --> 00:10:38,519
These past few years
I've just been getting worse

165
00:10:39,319 --> 00:10:41,321
Come on, open it mom

166
00:10:57,417 --> 00:10:58,218
Xiulan

167
00:10:58,298 --> 00:10:59,099
What?

168
00:10:59,179 --> 00:11:00,340
God, it's been so long since we've met!

169
00:11:01,061 --> 00:11:03,463
That's true, almost a year

170
00:11:05,105 --> 00:11:06,506
Are you happy tonight?

171
00:11:06,987 --> 00:11:07,908
Of course I'm happy

172
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:13,073
Strange! Why did you ask such a thing?

173
00:11:29,089 --> 00:11:31,331
Guoxiong, where are you going?

174
00:11:32,212 --> 00:11:33,333
This way doesn't lead to my home!

175
00:11:37,818 --> 00:11:38,699
Guoxiong

176
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:43,824
Let's go up for a while

177
00:11:45,505 --> 00:11:48,148
Xiulan, you know how much I love you

178
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:51,031
but this is totally different from love

179
00:11:51,592 --> 00:11:53,273
Haven't I told you before

180
00:11:53,393 --> 00:11:54,394
I mean, before we got married

181
00:11:54,474 --> 00:11:55,716
We should keep a pure
and clean relationship

182
00:11:55,916 --> 00:11:58,398
I know, but... I need you

183
00:11:59,079 --> 00:12:00,360
Stop it

184
00:12:00,561 --> 00:12:01,842
We should keep on waiting

185
00:12:01,922 --> 00:12:03,524
Until when? Wait till when?

186
00:12:04,404 --> 00:12:06,687
Until we get married.

187
00:12:06,807 --> 00:12:09,449
by then everything of mine will be yours

188
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:11,131
Must we wait till marriage?

189
00:12:13,293 --> 00:12:16,136
Xiulan, I can't wait any longer

190
00:12:16,697 --> 00:12:17,778
Don't make it difficult for me, please

191
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:23,263
Tonight, I can go home by myself

192
00:13:42,543 --> 00:13:43,303
I'm sorry

193
00:13:44,104 --> 00:13:44,945
It's okay

194
00:13:45,465 --> 00:13:47,227
Miss, you are bowling all alone

195
00:13:48,428 --> 00:13:49,429
Shall we bowl together?

196
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:50,230
Sure!

197
00:13:51,912 --> 00:13:53,433
How about we make a bet or something?

198
00:13:53,514 --> 00:13:54,474
Gamble?

199
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:56,797
Sure, if I win...

200
00:13:56,877 --> 00:13:58,358
I will treat you to a dinner and dance

201
00:13:59,159 --> 00:14:01,241
You pay if you win?

202
00:14:09,329 --> 00:14:10,170
Strike

203
00:14:12,332 --> 00:14:14,895
In this case, I'll surely make a bet

204
00:14:15,015 --> 00:14:15,856
Really?

205
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:50,651
Please

206
00:14:51,892 --> 00:14:55,215
Is this your car? very cool

207
00:14:56,897 --> 00:14:57,978
Let's go for a ride first, okay?

208
00:14:58,098 --> 00:15:00,621
Sure. I'll go anywhere

209
00:15:00,741 --> 00:15:02,823
with a man as handsome as you

210
00:17:03,463 --> 00:17:04,785
Do you like me?

211
00:17:06,266 --> 00:17:07,307
Of course

212
00:17:07,588 --> 00:17:09,389
Otherwise I won't bring you here

213
00:17:09,469 --> 00:17:11,592
Really! That's good

214
00:17:11,672 --> 00:17:15,155
Then we should meet more often, shall we?

215
00:17:16,196 --> 00:17:16,837
Yeah

216
00:17:17,638 --> 00:17:18,599
When?

217
00:17:21,121 --> 00:17:22,242
You tell me when?

218
00:17:22,482 --> 00:17:23,163
Tomorrow

219
00:17:24,444 --> 00:17:25,365
Tomorrow?

220
00:17:25,886 --> 00:17:26,927
I can't make it tomorrow

221
00:17:28,368 --> 00:17:29,289
Then the day after tomorrow

222
00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:31,051
Neither can I

223
00:17:31,932 --> 00:17:33,093
When then?

224
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:36,897
So, you really like me that much

225
00:17:39,379 --> 00:17:43,263
Then next Monday at 8pm

226
00:17:43,544 --> 00:17:45,145
Wait for me outside the bowling center

227
00:17:45,265 --> 00:17:46,907
Sure, I'll be there

228
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:00,841
Good morning, General Manager

229
00:18:01,762 --> 00:18:02,523
So it's you!

230
00:18:07,768 --> 00:18:09,970
Something important
came up yesterday night

231
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:10,851
That I wanted to report to you

232
00:18:11,612 --> 00:18:13,093
I've called the hotel a few times

233
00:18:13,213 --> 00:18:14,655
but you weren't in

234
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:16,737
Did you go out with Miss Xiulan?

235
00:18:17,057 --> 00:18:17,898
That's none of your business

236
00:18:18,779 --> 00:18:19,980
What's so important?

237
00:18:20,581 --> 00:18:21,461
I'll tell you now

238
00:18:24,865 --> 00:18:26,026
These are the ten cars that
we ordered from...

239
00:18:26,146 --> 00:18:27,628
The volkswagen Company in West Germany

240
00:18:27,868 --> 00:18:29,029
They'll be here on the 10th of this month

241
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:30,991
We've ordered another five Chevrolets

242
00:18:31,071 --> 00:18:32,873
...of 1969 make from The States

243
00:18:48,929 --> 00:18:50,450
Mr. Zhou,
you're here to write a novel again

244
00:18:50,531 --> 00:18:53,253
This time it's lyrics,
for a record company

245
00:18:55,295 --> 00:18:57,578
Who knows what he writes

246
00:18:57,698 --> 00:19:00,060
but he is pretty handsome

247
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:01,822
What? Have you fallen for him?

248
00:19:02,102 --> 00:19:02,823
bullshit

249
00:19:04,264 --> 00:19:05,546
I don't believe that

250
00:19:05,666 --> 00:19:07,588
One needs a special place to write

251
00:19:26,647 --> 00:19:30,971
22nd of January, Liu Minghua

252
00:19:34,695 --> 00:19:36,176
After I had an argument with Xiulan

253
00:19:36,577 --> 00:19:38,579
I went to the bowling center alone

254
00:19:39,499 --> 00:19:41,261
I saw a woman bowling all by herself

255
00:19:42,182 --> 00:19:43,423
So I bowled with her

256
00:19:44,464 --> 00:19:46,587
She seemed to have
just lived out of poverty

257
00:19:47,507 --> 00:19:49,590
And like, enjoying her novae rich life

258
00:20:02,282 --> 00:20:03,243
She really came

259
00:20:04,685 --> 00:20:06,647
These kind of women get together
just for fun

260
00:20:07,087 --> 00:20:08,769
It's better not seeing her again

261
00:20:43,083 --> 00:20:44,204
Let's pick this one

262
00:20:44,484 --> 00:20:46,446
No way, this one is too noisy

263
00:20:46,527 --> 00:20:49,449
We should pick one
that's a bit more graceful

264
00:20:49,530 --> 00:20:50,971
What do you know? This is a wedding gift

265
00:20:51,091 --> 00:20:52,372
So what?

266
00:20:52,492 --> 00:20:54,254
Looks like you're very experienced

267
00:20:54,454 --> 00:20:57,337
Of course, everybody now talks of techno

268
00:20:57,457 --> 00:21:00,260
Maybe they have a bug in their new house

269
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:01,862
And they can eavesdrop on every word

270
00:21:03,383 --> 00:21:04,865
So make it a bit noisier

271
00:21:04,945 --> 00:21:06,627
That way they can't hear us, right?

272
00:21:07,908 --> 00:21:09,870
Whatever, pick what you want

273
00:21:10,911 --> 00:21:11,632
Let's get this one!

274
00:21:11,712 --> 00:21:12,432
Ten dollars

275
00:21:12,753 --> 00:21:13,834
We'll send the gift over

276
00:21:13,954 --> 00:21:14,514
Okay!

277
00:21:16,396 --> 00:21:18,238
Qimei, let's go!

278
00:21:18,318 --> 00:21:20,681
I've something to do

279
00:21:20,801 --> 00:21:21,802
I'm not going

280
00:21:22,963 --> 00:21:24,725
She never comes with us

281
00:21:24,845 --> 00:21:25,485
That's true

282
00:21:48,108 --> 00:21:49,830
So she is lying

283
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:50,871
It's not that
she can't attend the wedding

284
00:21:52,032 --> 00:21:52,753
but she is saddened by the joy

285
00:21:52,873 --> 00:21:54,995
Of the young married couple

286
00:21:57,237 --> 00:21:58,919
A woman at her age

287
00:21:59,479 --> 00:22:01,041
Of course wants to get married

288
00:22:01,802 --> 00:22:03,804
She of course wants the comfort
from a man

289
00:22:05,285 --> 00:22:07,888
This kind of woman
will have a different feel

290
00:22:08,569 --> 00:22:10,490
A woman like her

291
00:22:10,571 --> 00:22:12,933
Will desire the warmth from a man

292
00:22:18,138 --> 00:22:22,142
I'm sorry

293
00:22:23,584 --> 00:22:24,825
So you like...

294
00:22:24,905 --> 00:22:25,826
Japanese movies

295
00:22:27,788 --> 00:22:28,428
Watching Japanese movies

296
00:22:28,549 --> 00:22:29,790
One can also see the scenery of Japan

297
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:31,111
It's so nostalgic

298
00:22:32,232 --> 00:22:33,073
Are you Japanese?

299
00:22:33,153 --> 00:22:35,756
No, I'm Chinese, but I lived in Japan

300
00:22:36,276 --> 00:22:37,037
My name is Yang Gangtian

301
00:22:38,478 --> 00:22:39,760
So the places shown in this movie

302
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:40,801
Are not new to you at all

303
00:22:40,881 --> 00:22:42,042
Not all though

304
00:22:45,125 --> 00:22:46,046
Do you come to Hong Kong often?

305
00:23:38,178 --> 00:23:40,060
That's why I remain single

306
00:23:40,981 --> 00:23:42,382
No worries at all

307
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:46,386
My friends are very concerned about
my love life

308
00:23:47,227 --> 00:23:48,108
I don't care however

309
00:23:49,469 --> 00:23:53,473
Think about this; each day, every year

310
00:23:55,155 --> 00:23:58,478
And the whole life
spend with only one person

311
00:23:59,199 --> 00:24:00,280
How boring!

312
00:24:04,244 --> 00:24:06,246
Well, you don't understand

313
00:24:06,687 --> 00:24:08,208
I do

314
00:24:08,889 --> 00:24:10,611
because I'm also single

315
00:24:11,211 --> 00:24:14,054
but you do know what being content is

316
00:24:15,495 --> 00:24:20,020
Okay, tonight I'll let you feel

317
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:21,461
How it's like to be contended

318
00:24:26,266 --> 00:24:27,788
Let's go to a new place for drinks,
how's that?

319
00:24:28,068 --> 00:24:29,229
Sure, no problem

320
00:24:32,352 --> 00:24:33,273
It should be my turn to pay

321
00:24:33,393 --> 00:24:35,195
What? You think I'm broke

322
00:24:35,876 --> 00:24:39,239
Don't worry, I enjoy paying the bill;
especially...

323
00:24:39,439 --> 00:24:41,842
when it comes to treating someone
as pretty as you

324
00:25:01,742 --> 00:25:03,784
Not a single man
has ever come to my place

325
00:25:03,864 --> 00:25:04,545
You're an exception

326
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:10,911
Please wait a minute

327
00:25:28,849 --> 00:25:30,450
Hold on, my friend is about to go to bed

328
00:25:30,531 --> 00:25:33,253
You can take a rest here! Help yourself

329
00:25:34,374 --> 00:25:36,296
How can I? You don't have to

330
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:40,981
Come, undress and go to sleep!

331
00:25:56,677 --> 00:25:58,158
No, don't be so naughty

332
00:26:03,163 --> 00:26:04,525
No, don't do that

333
00:26:07,768 --> 00:26:09,610
No...

334
00:27:06,627 --> 00:27:07,267
Come in

335
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:41,742
This woman

336
00:27:43,904 --> 00:27:46,026
Isn't she the one that
I've known a while ago?

337
00:28:43,403 --> 00:28:46,446
The police are looking into
Liu Minghua's boyfriend

338
00:28:47,007 --> 00:28:48,689
Will they come to me?

339
00:28:50,010 --> 00:28:54,134
No, I'm a Chinese Japanese named
Yang Gangtian

340
00:28:54,975 --> 00:28:56,617
Even if they come to me

341
00:28:57,057 --> 00:28:59,219
I can still prove that
I wasn't at the scene

342
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:02,142
because when she was killed

343
00:29:02,262 --> 00:29:04,665
I was with Li Qimei

344
00:29:11,351 --> 00:29:12,432
Where is Miss Su?

345
00:29:12,673 --> 00:29:13,433
She's in the backyard

346
00:29:23,003 --> 00:29:23,884
Miss Su

347
00:29:27,007 --> 00:29:29,650
Is it true that
you will go back to Tokyo...

348
00:29:29,770 --> 00:29:30,531
before the end of the year?

349
00:29:31,171 --> 00:29:33,253
No, that will be rather too hurried

350
00:29:33,734 --> 00:29:35,335
Maybe I'll spend the New Year with mom

351
00:29:35,696 --> 00:29:37,658
Anyway I haven't decided yet

352
00:29:38,138 --> 00:29:41,221
Have you heard something about Guoxiong

353
00:29:41,662 --> 00:29:42,462
About what?

354
00:29:43,664 --> 00:29:46,026
Someone asked me about him

355
00:29:46,106 --> 00:29:47,628
Said he has other women...

356
00:29:48,268 --> 00:29:50,350
Mr. Li, Guoxiong has other women

357
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:52,072
It's partly my fault

358
00:29:52,312 --> 00:29:53,273
Your fault?

359
00:29:53,393 --> 00:29:55,676
Yes, but, Mr. Li

360
00:29:55,796 --> 00:29:57,998
You have nothing to do
with us other than business

361
00:29:58,238 --> 00:29:59,880
So please don't interfere
into our relationship

362
00:30:03,203 --> 00:30:05,165
Mr. Li, your phone call

363
00:30:05,285 --> 00:30:06,046
My phone call?

364
00:30:07,327 --> 00:30:07,928
Excuse me

365
00:30:15,255 --> 00:30:17,137
Hello, this is Li Donghai

366
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:20,861
Call me only at work

367
00:30:20,981 --> 00:30:22,222
Haven't I told you that?

368
00:30:44,324 --> 00:30:46,046
It's been a while since he came here

369
00:30:46,446 --> 00:30:47,888
Did you two argue again?

370
00:30:49,810 --> 00:30:51,491
We had an argument

371
00:30:52,573 --> 00:30:53,694
The day I came back from Japan

372
00:30:54,815 --> 00:30:56,136
That's not very good!

373
00:30:56,857 --> 00:30:58,418
You're too strong in temper

374
00:30:58,498 --> 00:31:00,020
Just like a boy

375
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:01,902
A lady should be more gentle

376
00:31:02,743 --> 00:31:04,665
Otherwise Guoxiong will not like you

377
00:31:05,626 --> 00:31:06,587
Let me get it

378
00:31:09,830 --> 00:31:14,034
Hello, Guoxiong,
we're just talking about you

379
00:31:14,234 --> 00:31:14,875
How are you?

380
00:31:15,395 --> 00:31:16,917
I haven't seen you for a long time,
I'm sorry

381
00:31:17,638 --> 00:31:19,199
The company has got a very large order

382
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:20,040
And I'm very busy

383
00:31:20,921 --> 00:31:22,002
Tonight I'm free

384
00:31:22,202 --> 00:31:24,484
Shall we go see a movie?

385
00:31:24,605 --> 00:31:25,606
Oh, I'm very sorry

386
00:31:26,286 --> 00:31:28,528
Tonight I need to go to a friend's place

387
00:31:29,329 --> 00:31:30,250
It's all arranged

388
00:31:33,293 --> 00:31:36,056
Oh yes! I was free in the past few days

389
00:31:36,176 --> 00:31:37,858
I felt so bored at home

390
00:31:38,138 --> 00:31:39,059
And you didn't call me

391
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:42,502
What a pity. Let's meet some other time

392
00:31:43,664 --> 00:31:45,385
Okay, bye

393
00:31:48,308 --> 00:31:51,071
Whose place are you going tonight?

394
00:31:51,191 --> 00:31:54,915
It's a lie. I'll let him down first

395
00:31:55,035 --> 00:31:56,637
Then I'll see him at the office

396
00:31:56,757 --> 00:31:57,958
...to give him a surprise

397
00:31:58,078 --> 00:31:59,960
Mind you don't turn it into a tragedy

398
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,722
If you keep on fooling him like this

399
00:32:04,885 --> 00:32:06,727
This kid is so unmannered

400
00:33:56,476 --> 00:33:59,439
Is there a Mr. Zhou living in here?

401
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:00,881
Mr. Zhou, yes

402
00:34:01,081 --> 00:34:02,643
Do you mean
the one who is writing a novel?

403
00:34:02,763 --> 00:34:03,684
Writing a novel?

404
00:34:04,324 --> 00:34:05,686
Yes, you're right

405
00:34:06,366 --> 00:34:09,129
I'm his fiancee Su Xiulan

406
00:34:09,369 --> 00:34:11,732
Mr. Zhou asked me
to wait for him in the room

407
00:34:11,852 --> 00:34:13,774
To wait for him? That's strange

408
00:34:13,894 --> 00:34:15,135
He just drove away

409
00:34:15,415 --> 00:34:16,296
He's out?

410
00:34:16,937 --> 00:34:18,298
It doesn't matter

411
00:34:18,378 --> 00:34:19,259
Mr. Zhou said...

412
00:34:19,339 --> 00:34:21,381
Just inform the security
and that will be fine

413
00:34:21,461 --> 00:34:23,343
Well...
it's not supposed to be like that...

414
00:34:23,463 --> 00:34:24,344
but...

415
00:34:25,265 --> 00:34:27,828
It's okay, come with me

416
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:40,761
Please help yourself

417
00:34:40,881 --> 00:34:41,642
Thank you

418
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:11,431
Diary of a lady-killer?

419
00:35:14,875 --> 00:35:18,238
Hope one day
I can win the heart of Xiulan

420
00:35:18,318 --> 00:35:21,441
True love is not
only a matter of spirituality

421
00:35:21,722 --> 00:35:24,204
but also a matter of physical enjoyment

422
00:35:30,691 --> 00:35:32,693
She is like a prey to my trap

423
00:35:32,973 --> 00:35:34,775
So I took her to the hotel

424
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:44,464
She didn't resist at all,
I can do whatever I want

425
00:36:07,688 --> 00:36:10,611
Guoxiong, how can you face up to me

426
00:36:30,110 --> 00:36:31,992
You painting is very good,
you're so talented

427
00:36:32,833 --> 00:36:34,434
You have a bright future ahead of you

428
00:36:34,555 --> 00:36:35,235
Are you an artist?

429
00:36:35,355 --> 00:36:37,838
No, I'm a special correspondent of
the London Times

430
00:36:38,679 --> 00:36:40,601
I like sculptural art

431
00:36:42,162 --> 00:36:43,083
Two weeks ago

432
00:36:43,203 --> 00:36:44,765
I went to vietnam to conduct an interview

433
00:36:45,646 --> 00:36:47,247
I stopped over in Hong Kong
on the way back

434
00:36:47,527 --> 00:36:49,209
Hong Kong is known to be
the Pearl of the East

435
00:36:50,130 --> 00:36:51,892
So I wanted to have a glimpse of
some Eastern art

436
00:36:52,012 --> 00:36:54,615
With this chance of a stop-over

437
00:36:55,856 --> 00:36:58,178
but, I didn't know that...

438
00:36:58,298 --> 00:36:59,660
Maybe I have to give up this idea

439
00:37:02,382 --> 00:37:03,984
She has a good hobby

440
00:37:04,464 --> 00:37:07,427
Woman who likes art
will easily fall for a man

441
00:37:11,511 --> 00:37:13,794
Miss Zhu, I have a good idea

442
00:37:14,755 --> 00:37:15,876
Let's have a drink

443
00:37:16,276 --> 00:37:18,919
I'd like to thank you
for being my charming escort

444
00:37:19,039 --> 00:37:21,361
Let's have a good time tonight

445
00:37:21,481 --> 00:37:22,282
How does that sound?

446
00:37:23,043 --> 00:37:23,764
Good

447
00:38:30,631 --> 00:38:31,832
Want to come up?

448
00:38:51,091 --> 00:38:51,932
Come in!

449
00:38:54,494 --> 00:38:55,535
Just put it here

450
00:39:01,261 --> 00:39:04,064
Please take a seat,
I need to change my clothes

451
00:39:06,987 --> 00:39:07,948
Don't look!

452
00:39:14,354 --> 00:39:15,395
I need your help

453
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:21,041
It's okay, you can go back to your seat

454
00:39:22,162 --> 00:39:23,283
Don't look

455
00:39:35,495 --> 00:39:36,657
I said don't peep, and you don't listen

456
00:39:56,356 --> 00:39:56,957
Ready yet?

457
00:39:57,077 --> 00:39:57,918
Okay, have a seat

458
00:40:06,166 --> 00:40:07,087
Come

459
00:40:17,137 --> 00:40:18,418
You're so beautiful

460
00:40:30,591 --> 00:40:32,232
Let's toast for your beauty

461
00:40:58,699 --> 00:40:59,700
Please don't

462
00:41:28,368 --> 00:41:29,650
A body as perfect as yours

463
00:41:29,770 --> 00:41:31,371
Shouldn't be covered up by clothes

464
00:41:31,972 --> 00:41:34,054
It should be shown
and admired by everybody

465
00:41:35,295 --> 00:41:37,137
You really admire my body?

466
00:41:37,618 --> 00:41:39,820
Of course, it's God's greatest work

467
00:41:40,941 --> 00:41:41,622
Okay

468
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:22,142
I thought you're someone
who understands art

469
00:42:22,342 --> 00:42:23,944
One who knows how to appreciate beauty

470
00:42:24,064 --> 00:42:26,226
but, you're just as vulgar as
any other man

471
00:42:26,346 --> 00:42:27,548
I've made a mistake

472
00:42:27,668 --> 00:42:29,349
Don't be mad, Lizhen

473
00:42:30,070 --> 00:42:31,311
Your body is too gorgeous

474
00:42:31,431 --> 00:42:32,673
Let me look at it carefully

475
00:42:37,317 --> 00:42:38,198
Who?

476
00:42:38,278 --> 00:42:39,880
I'm Meiyun, open the door!

477
00:42:50,210 --> 00:42:51,091
He's so heavy

478
00:42:53,093 --> 00:42:55,495
Who told you to drink so much...

479
00:42:55,856 --> 00:42:56,617
Disgusting

480
00:42:58,098 --> 00:42:59,379
Why do you have to drink so much?

481
00:42:59,499 --> 00:43:00,500
Drunk as a pig

482
00:43:03,143 --> 00:43:05,425
You must be the new boyfriend of Lizhen!

483
00:43:06,226 --> 00:43:08,188
I'm sorry, I'm Meiyun

484
00:43:08,589 --> 00:43:09,469
I'm learning painting

485
00:43:10,791 --> 00:43:11,912
Let's have a drink, how's that?

486
00:43:12,272 --> 00:43:13,153
I need to go, please enjoy yourself!

487
00:43:14,394 --> 00:43:16,637
Meiyun... come here

488
00:43:18,278 --> 00:43:19,439
Who told you to drink so heavily

489
00:43:21,041 --> 00:43:21,922
Wait

490
00:43:25,045 --> 00:43:25,806
I'm sorry

491
00:43:26,727 --> 00:43:27,447
It's okay

492
00:43:28,008 --> 00:43:29,049
Are we still friends?

493
00:43:29,129 --> 00:43:29,730
Of course

494
00:43:30,651 --> 00:43:31,692
This is my phone number

495
00:43:32,092 --> 00:43:33,654
When you come by, call me first

496
00:43:35,656 --> 00:43:37,257
Good, I'll surely call you

497
00:43:37,618 --> 00:43:39,580
Lizhen...

498
00:43:45,465 --> 00:43:46,226
Goodbye

499
00:45:46,026 --> 00:45:47,788
Liu Minghua has been strangled to death

500
00:45:48,068 --> 00:45:49,870
And so is Li Qimei

501
00:45:50,470 --> 00:45:52,913
Whether or not
these two cases are related

502
00:45:53,153 --> 00:45:54,314
but, how could they coincide so?

503
00:45:54,915 --> 00:45:56,276
It's a weird coincidence, if at all

504
00:46:27,828 --> 00:46:29,389
Why is it that whoever slept with me...

505
00:46:29,469 --> 00:46:30,631
is being killed one by one

506
00:46:33,273 --> 00:46:36,236
It couldn't be true.
Why are these things happening?

507
00:46:54,294 --> 00:46:57,177
Is there anything that you want,
General Manager?

508
00:46:57,297 --> 00:46:57,978
Nothing

509
00:47:11,672 --> 00:47:12,432
Hello

510
00:47:16,076 --> 00:47:16,597
Hello

511
00:47:16,677 --> 00:47:18,999
Hello, are you Guoxiong?

512
00:47:20,641 --> 00:47:23,764
I'm Xiulan. I'm now in Tokyo

513
00:47:23,884 --> 00:47:24,645
Tokyo?

514
00:47:25,886 --> 00:47:27,247
How come you are in Tokyo?

515
00:47:27,487 --> 00:47:28,969
I'll tell you later

516
00:47:29,570 --> 00:47:32,252
Guoxiong, please come to Tokyo at once

517
00:47:32,372 --> 00:47:34,014
I need to talk to you

518
00:47:34,895 --> 00:47:35,816
You must come

519
00:47:51,872 --> 00:47:52,673
Guoxiong

520
00:47:55,395 --> 00:47:56,997
I know why you asked me to come to Tokyo

521
00:47:57,237 --> 00:47:58,318
Today is Easter

522
00:47:58,438 --> 00:48:00,440
You want us
to spend the holiday in Tokyo, right?

523
00:48:18,458 --> 00:48:23,103
Guoxiong, what are you thinking of?

524
00:48:26,026 --> 00:48:28,549
I was thinking, I hope one day

525
00:48:28,669 --> 00:48:30,951
We can find a place
that belongs only to us

526
00:48:32,152 --> 00:48:34,354
We will love each other and nothing else

527
00:48:35,275 --> 00:48:36,877
I'm yours, and you're mine

528
00:48:37,678 --> 00:48:39,519
We'll lead a happy life together

529
00:48:40,881 --> 00:48:44,364
A happy life together? How lovely

530
00:48:45,205 --> 00:48:46,046
Tell me, Guoxiong

531
00:48:46,767 --> 00:48:48,969
Can we really lead a happy life together

532
00:48:49,089 --> 00:48:50,130
And stay with each other forever?

533
00:48:52,212 --> 00:48:52,853
Of course!

534
00:48:54,374 --> 00:48:55,415
Guoxiong

535
00:49:04,504 --> 00:49:04,905
Guoxiong...

536
00:49:05,025 --> 00:49:06,627
What happened?

537
00:49:07,067 --> 00:49:09,189
Are you okay? Guoxiong...

538
00:49:18,158 --> 00:49:21,281
Help me...

539
00:49:27,648 --> 00:49:28,569
Are you feeling better now?

540
00:49:30,530 --> 00:49:33,333
You suddenly fainted in the night club

541
00:49:33,453 --> 00:49:36,296
God, you sure scared me!
Are you too tired?

542
00:49:36,777 --> 00:49:37,578
I'm sorry

543
00:49:37,938 --> 00:49:40,060
Maybe the performance proved too daring

544
00:49:42,062 --> 00:49:45,465
What did you dream of?
You were talking in your dream

545
00:49:50,831 --> 00:49:51,712
Xiulan

546
00:49:52,112 --> 00:49:54,675
We've come all this way
to spend the holiday here

547
00:49:54,795 --> 00:49:56,717
but I've ruined it

548
00:49:56,997 --> 00:49:58,238
I'm so sorry

549
00:49:58,679 --> 00:50:00,921
Don't say that, we are now together

550
00:50:01,041 --> 00:50:03,644
...for a peaceful Easter night.
Isn't that better?

551
00:50:09,249 --> 00:50:10,530
You know why I would suddenly

552
00:50:10,651 --> 00:50:12,092
...come to Tokyo?

553
00:50:13,493 --> 00:50:14,214
Why?

554
00:50:15,295 --> 00:50:17,698
I need to think carefully about
our relationship

555
00:50:18,298 --> 00:50:19,139
Xiulan

556
00:50:19,539 --> 00:50:21,181
I think we should break up

557
00:50:21,862 --> 00:50:22,783
Why?

558
00:50:22,863 --> 00:50:24,224
I don't want to see you anymore

559
00:50:25,305 --> 00:50:28,028
What? Xiulan, do you despise me

560
00:50:28,508 --> 00:50:29,630
You don't love me anymore

561
00:50:29,870 --> 00:50:31,912
I... but I...

562
00:50:32,032 --> 00:50:32,993
but what?

563
00:50:34,114 --> 00:50:35,916
I don't know what I should do

564
00:50:36,877 --> 00:50:38,238
I'm so sad

565
00:50:38,478 --> 00:50:41,041
Sad? Who makes you so sad?

566
00:50:41,602 --> 00:50:43,443
You better ask yourself

567
00:50:55,576 --> 00:50:56,456
I've read your diary

568
00:50:56,536 --> 00:50:58,098
You...

569
00:50:59,339 --> 00:51:01,461
Guoxiong, for one whole year

570
00:51:01,582 --> 00:51:03,263
You were having affairs with those women

571
00:51:03,864 --> 00:51:05,185
I have not the slightest idea at all

572
00:51:05,425 --> 00:51:07,187
I still give out all my heart to you

573
00:51:07,467 --> 00:51:08,629
How can you face up to me?

574
00:51:09,710 --> 00:51:11,872
Xiulan, please forgive me

575
00:51:12,272 --> 00:51:13,473
How can I forgive you!

576
00:51:14,194 --> 00:51:15,475
We are engaged

577
00:51:15,596 --> 00:51:17,157
And still you did such a thing

578
00:51:18,118 --> 00:51:19,519
How wrong you are!

579
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,563
You can scold me, but please believe me

580
00:51:23,043 --> 00:51:25,445
I do truly love you,
and will remain so forever

581
00:51:26,687 --> 00:51:27,728
I know you love me

582
00:51:28,448 --> 00:51:30,410
but I've never rejected you

583
00:51:30,530 --> 00:51:33,173
I just want you to wait if you love me

584
00:51:33,774 --> 00:51:35,055
Why can't you wait?

585
00:51:35,295 --> 00:51:36,456
but instead, you turn to other women

586
00:51:38,338 --> 00:51:39,780
It's exactly because I love you too much

587
00:51:40,661 --> 00:51:42,142
So every time when you reject me

588
00:51:43,463 --> 00:51:45,025
I got, like possessed
by an inferiority complex

589
00:51:45,265 --> 00:51:47,187
So strong that I had no choice

590
00:51:47,908 --> 00:51:49,429
but to overcome it by finding other women

591
00:51:50,991 --> 00:51:54,675
I regretted so much every time
after the affair

592
00:51:55,155 --> 00:51:56,396
I felt I have let you down

593
00:52:01,962 --> 00:52:03,083
If so...

594
00:52:06,366 --> 00:52:08,248
Why don't you go see a doctor?

595
00:52:09,369 --> 00:52:11,572
I will. When I go back

596
00:52:11,852 --> 00:52:13,053
I will surely find myself a doctor

597
00:52:14,815 --> 00:52:15,535
Guoxiong

598
00:52:16,857 --> 00:52:18,899
Know somethin'?
Actually I had decided that

599
00:52:19,019 --> 00:52:20,380
I won't forgive you

600
00:52:20,941 --> 00:52:22,823
but... l've failed

601
00:52:23,503 --> 00:52:25,065
I do truly love you

602
00:52:25,706 --> 00:52:27,668
Xiulan, I've let you down

603
00:52:29,870 --> 00:52:30,991
I've let you down

604
00:52:40,921 --> 00:52:42,082
What happened?

605
00:52:44,725 --> 00:52:45,926
Let us calm down

606
00:52:46,486 --> 00:52:47,848
Otherwise we'll go against your wish

607
00:52:48,488 --> 00:52:49,730
Let's wait till we get married

608
00:52:51,091 --> 00:52:53,453
Guoxiong, you're so good

609
00:53:10,911 --> 00:53:14,194
I think this is
the most meaningful Easter

610
00:53:14,274 --> 00:53:16,476
...we've ever had, isn't it?

611
00:53:25,525 --> 00:53:26,446
It's raining

612
00:54:31,311 --> 00:54:35,155
Someone is plotting against me

613
00:54:35,475 --> 00:54:36,236
Guoxiong

614
00:54:38,879 --> 00:54:40,641
Guoxiong, what are you talking about?

615
00:54:41,241 --> 00:54:43,804
Xiulan, will you believe me

616
00:54:43,884 --> 00:54:44,845
No matter what happened?

617
00:54:45,686 --> 00:54:46,887
I will believe you

618
00:54:47,007 --> 00:54:48,408
I need to return to Hong Kong tomorrow

619
00:54:48,488 --> 00:54:49,730
...to deal with an important matter

620
00:54:50,090 --> 00:54:51,211
What is it?

621
00:54:51,291 --> 00:54:52,452
I can't tell you now

622
00:54:53,373 --> 00:54:54,414
Nor do I want to see you...

623
00:54:54,494 --> 00:54:55,856
getting involved in this

624
00:54:56,296 --> 00:54:58,098
We can only lead
a true happy life together

625
00:54:58,218 --> 00:54:59,339
...after this matter is settled

626
00:54:59,459 --> 00:55:00,380
Then...

627
00:55:10,871 --> 00:55:13,714
Zhu Lizhen, will she also get killed?

628
00:55:15,075 --> 00:55:16,076
Now she's the only one who can prove

629
00:55:16,196 --> 00:55:18,118
...that I'm not the murderer

630
00:55:40,741 --> 00:55:41,822
Miss Zhu, you're back!

631
00:55:42,863 --> 00:55:43,784
I've called you a few times

632
00:55:43,864 --> 00:55:44,865
but you weren't in

633
00:55:45,305 --> 00:55:47,988
Now is the school holiday,
no one is around

634
00:55:48,068 --> 00:55:49,029
Can we meet?

635
00:55:50,190 --> 00:55:52,032
I need to talk to you
about something important

636
00:55:52,553 --> 00:55:53,473
Meet with me?

637
00:55:55,395 --> 00:55:57,117
Tonight 11:30 at your home

638
00:55:57,798 --> 00:55:59,640
Sure, I'll be there. bye

639
00:56:03,924 --> 00:56:05,005
Good, nothing has happened to her

640
00:56:06,486 --> 00:56:08,008
Maybe I'm too sensitive

641
00:56:46,607 --> 00:56:47,688
This is strange!

642
00:56:47,928 --> 00:56:49,890
Li Qimei's home is like this
when she got killed

643
00:56:52,973 --> 00:56:54,054
Lizhen

644
00:57:03,343 --> 00:57:04,424
Lizhen

645
00:57:09,029 --> 00:57:09,990
Lizhen

646
00:57:13,193 --> 00:57:14,274
Lizhen

647
00:58:59,620 --> 00:59:01,582
Someone wants to trap me
with all these dead bodies

648
01:00:38,679 --> 01:00:40,881
Miss Zhu, Miss Zhu

649
01:00:44,084 --> 01:00:46,126
How come the door is opened

650
01:03:19,960 --> 01:03:22,603
The diary of a lady killer is lost

651
01:03:35,335 --> 01:03:37,017
Even though I didn't kill them

652
01:03:37,778 --> 01:03:39,780
Still, the police will suspect me

653
01:03:40,140 --> 01:03:41,622
They will come to me sooner or later

654
01:03:42,342 --> 01:03:44,264
I just hope that it won't be today

655
01:03:55,235 --> 01:03:58,078
When the first victim
Liu Minghua was killed

656
01:03:58,198 --> 01:03:59,079
Where were you?

657
01:04:01,481 --> 01:04:03,483
I'm asking, where were you?

658
01:04:03,724 --> 01:04:04,725
I was in Li Qimei's room

659
01:04:05,005 --> 01:04:06,647
So only Li Qimei can prove that...

660
01:04:06,767 --> 01:04:08,569
you were not at the scene

661
01:04:09,289 --> 01:04:10,530
but she also got killed

662
01:04:11,091 --> 01:04:14,134
That was 22nd of March,
2:30 in the morning

663
01:04:14,655 --> 01:04:15,856
Where were you by then?

664
01:04:16,336 --> 01:04:17,337
I was in Zhu Lizhen's room

665
01:04:17,698 --> 01:04:20,340
Zhu Lizhen also got killed later on

666
01:04:20,741 --> 01:04:22,222
When Liu Minghua was killed...

667
01:04:22,302 --> 01:04:24,304
The defendant was in Li Qimei's room

668
01:04:24,785 --> 01:04:26,066
When Li Qimei got killed

669
01:04:26,186 --> 01:04:28,188
The defendant was in Zhu Lizhen's room

670
01:04:28,949 --> 01:04:31,511
That means except for the dead

671
01:04:31,632 --> 01:04:32,552
No one can prove that

672
01:04:32,673 --> 01:04:34,595
The defendant was not at the scene

673
01:04:34,755 --> 01:04:35,515
That means...

674
01:04:35,636 --> 01:04:37,557
Yes, someone else can prove that

675
01:04:37,678 --> 01:04:38,398
Who?

676
01:04:38,558 --> 01:04:39,760
That night a man and a woman came in

677
01:04:39,880 --> 01:04:40,961
They are friends of Lizhen

678
01:04:41,081 --> 01:04:43,564
They came for Lizhen,
and they even looked at me

679
01:04:43,684 --> 01:04:46,286
What are their names?

680
01:04:50,290 --> 01:04:51,211
I forgot

681
01:04:51,291 --> 01:04:52,653
Where do they live?

682
01:04:55,776 --> 01:04:57,057
I can't remember

683
01:05:00,941 --> 01:05:02,182
Quiet

684
01:05:02,583 --> 01:05:04,665
When Zhu Lizhen was killed

685
01:05:04,785 --> 01:05:05,666
Where were you?

686
01:05:07,948 --> 01:05:08,949
Where were you?

687
01:05:13,073 --> 01:05:15,876
You can't answer that! No wonder

688
01:05:16,837 --> 01:05:19,039
The night Zhu Lizhen got killed

689
01:05:19,159 --> 01:05:20,881
The defendant was in Zhu Lizhen's room

690
01:05:21,001 --> 01:05:22,122
It's a conspiracy

691
01:05:22,482 --> 01:05:24,805
Someone intentionally killed them
one by one

692
01:05:24,885 --> 01:05:26,406
Someone is plotting against me

693
01:05:30,971 --> 01:05:31,852
Calm down

694
01:05:35,816 --> 01:05:38,659
The court will now produce
the following exhibits

695
01:05:42,863 --> 01:05:44,785
According to the test result

696
01:05:44,865 --> 01:05:48,388
This panty hose is the means
which was used in murder

697
01:05:48,749 --> 01:05:50,270
This was found in the defendant's room

698
01:05:50,390 --> 01:05:51,872
At Apartment Luoyang

699
01:05:52,512 --> 01:05:56,757
The second exhibit is this lighter
and cigarette butt

700
01:05:57,517 --> 01:06:00,480
Found in the room of the victim, Li Qimei

701
01:06:01,041 --> 01:06:02,482
The defendant
has already admitted that...

702
01:06:02,603 --> 01:06:04,805
The lighter belongs to him

703
01:06:06,486 --> 01:06:09,650
The third one is a tie

704
01:06:09,930 --> 01:06:10,611
This tie is the tool

705
01:06:10,691 --> 01:06:13,453
That was used to killed Zhu Lizhen

706
01:06:14,094 --> 01:06:16,056
Also found in the room of the defendant

707
01:06:19,379 --> 01:06:21,662
Doctor,
did you notice any sign of struggling

708
01:06:21,782 --> 01:06:23,864
With Zhu Lizhen?

709
01:06:24,585 --> 01:06:26,186
That's a bit hard to say.
blood stain was found

710
01:06:26,266 --> 01:06:29,029
inside the right hand finger nail
of the defendant

711
01:06:29,429 --> 01:06:30,550
What's the blood type?

712
01:06:31,672 --> 01:06:32,472
Type Ab

713
01:06:33,113 --> 01:06:34,835
What's the blood type of the victim?

714
01:06:35,275 --> 01:06:36,076
Type O

715
01:06:36,516 --> 01:06:38,438
And the blood type of the defendant?

716
01:06:39,159 --> 01:06:40,200
Type Ab

717
01:06:40,280 --> 01:06:41,041
Okay

718
01:06:42,082 --> 01:06:44,244
In order to prove that
the defendant is guilty

719
01:06:44,364 --> 01:06:48,288
The Court allows appearance of
a special witness

720
01:06:49,489 --> 01:06:51,251
About a year and a half ago

721
01:06:51,331 --> 01:06:53,373
Mr. Zhou rented a room in our place

722
01:06:53,734 --> 01:06:55,696
He said... he is a novel writer

723
01:06:56,897 --> 01:06:58,859
Mr. Zhou is the General Manager of the

724
01:06:58,939 --> 01:07:00,981
Locally acclaimed Far East Company

725
01:07:01,061 --> 01:07:02,983
When he stayed in our hotel

726
01:07:03,063 --> 01:07:05,586
There was nothing suspicious about him

727
01:07:06,306 --> 01:07:09,109
As of the murder case of Liu Minghua

728
01:07:09,229 --> 01:07:11,952
The defendant is not guilty
due to lack of evidence

729
01:07:13,273 --> 01:07:18,118
He's convicted for murders of
Li Qimei and Zhu Lizhen

730
01:07:18,238 --> 01:07:22,042
And will be sentenced to
imprisonment for life

731
01:07:23,203 --> 01:07:27,087
Guoxiong... Guoxiong

732
01:07:28,528 --> 01:07:31,772
Guoxiong... Guoxiong

733
01:07:33,213 --> 01:07:35,455
Guoxiong...

734
01:07:35,576 --> 01:07:40,340
I need to appeal...

735
01:07:40,460 --> 01:07:41,341
The Court is adjourned

736
01:07:52,512 --> 01:07:54,314
Are you Lawyer Hong?

737
01:07:54,715 --> 01:07:56,957
Yes, I'm Hong bolun. Have a seat

738
01:08:02,362 --> 01:08:03,243
Please, take a seat

739
01:08:08,128 --> 01:08:09,129
I'm Su Xiulan

740
01:08:10,090 --> 01:08:14,054
I know, after Zhou Guoxiong was sentenced

741
01:08:14,174 --> 01:08:17,658
He kept on calling your name

742
01:08:18,979 --> 01:08:21,221
So, you were at the Court that day

743
01:08:21,301 --> 01:08:22,382
To investigate in this case

744
01:08:22,903 --> 01:08:24,785
I wouldn't call it "investigation"

745
01:08:24,865 --> 01:08:27,307
I just happen to be
interested in this case

746
01:08:29,309 --> 01:08:32,633
Lawyer Hong,
I hope you can help Guoxiong

747
01:08:33,513 --> 01:08:34,675
He won't kill

748
01:08:34,955 --> 01:08:36,877
I don't believe that he is a murderer

749
01:08:38,639 --> 01:08:39,640
Do you have any proof?

750
01:08:40,881 --> 01:08:41,762
No

751
01:08:42,803 --> 01:08:46,166
but we have been engaged for
more than two years

752
01:08:46,967 --> 01:08:49,369
Of course he has been wrong in the past

753
01:08:50,010 --> 01:08:53,974
but recently he begged for my forgiveness

754
01:08:54,094 --> 01:08:55,616
And I did forgive him

755
01:08:55,736 --> 01:08:58,699
Our relationship has moved
a big step forward

756
01:08:58,819 --> 01:09:01,622
So why would he want to kill...

757
01:09:01,742 --> 01:09:03,223
when our relationship is
at it's best moment!

758
01:09:04,064 --> 01:09:05,225
Lawyer Hong

759
01:09:05,305 --> 01:09:08,148
I know you're very experienced

760
01:09:08,268 --> 01:09:09,670
And you have saved
a lot of innocent people

761
01:09:10,310 --> 01:09:12,432
So please help Guoxiong

762
01:09:12,552 --> 01:09:14,234
No matter what

763
01:09:16,476 --> 01:09:19,199
I know you love Zhou Guoxiong

764
01:09:19,800 --> 01:09:21,041
And you believe that he is innocent

765
01:09:22,482 --> 01:09:25,646
I also think that
this case has a lot of loopholes

766
01:09:27,327 --> 01:09:29,489
I believe that he is not the murderer

767
01:09:30,010 --> 01:09:32,252
That's why I'm willing to
investigate into it

768
01:09:33,453 --> 01:09:37,938
but Miss Su,
you have to cooperate with me

769
01:09:38,899 --> 01:09:40,460
I'd want to know about the past affairs

770
01:09:40,581 --> 01:09:42,863
...of your fiance

771
01:09:46,506 --> 01:09:48,108
I won't try to avoid the reality

772
01:09:48,909 --> 01:09:51,231
I lost my mind because ofjealousy

773
01:09:53,834 --> 01:09:55,035
I've no complains

774
01:09:56,597 --> 01:10:00,240
I envy Mr. Zhou

775
01:10:00,320 --> 01:10:01,281
For having such a loving fiancee as you

776
01:10:04,004 --> 01:10:05,966
First, you need to investigate

777
01:10:06,086 --> 01:10:08,569
into the hotels or apartments
that he lived in

778
01:10:09,529 --> 01:10:11,612
Most importantly,
to check out on those women

779
01:10:11,732 --> 01:10:13,774
who had frequent contacts with him

780
01:10:14,294 --> 01:10:17,738
Record their information in detail,
understand?

781
01:10:26,226 --> 01:10:27,187
Miss Xiulan, you're back

782
01:10:27,467 --> 01:10:28,949
Yes, speeding again

783
01:10:32,192 --> 01:10:32,552
Mom

784
01:10:32,673 --> 01:10:33,834
You're back, Xiulan

785
01:10:33,954 --> 01:10:35,555
Did you find a good lawyer?

786
01:10:35,676 --> 01:10:37,477
Mom, I have good news for you

787
01:10:37,718 --> 01:10:39,519
Lawyer Hong has agreed to help

788
01:10:39,640 --> 01:10:40,560
Lawyer Hong?

789
01:10:40,681 --> 01:10:42,643
Isn't he the famous Lawyer Hong bolun?

790
01:10:42,723 --> 01:10:43,644
Correct

791
01:10:43,724 --> 01:10:45,726
He's good at redressing mishandled cases

792
01:10:45,846 --> 01:10:46,887
If he can help...

793
01:10:47,007 --> 01:10:48,689
Guoxiong can be saved

794
01:10:49,930 --> 01:10:52,573
Great! I too do not believe that Guoxiong

795
01:10:52,693 --> 01:10:55,055
...would do such an evil thing

796
01:10:56,697 --> 01:10:58,258
Why did you bring out the birds?

797
01:10:58,859 --> 01:11:00,500
Madam

798
01:11:00,621 --> 01:11:02,623
The boss of the sausage shop
told me today that...

799
01:11:02,743 --> 01:11:04,024
birds need sunshine

800
01:11:04,104 --> 01:11:05,946
Sunbathing will make their songs
more delightful

801
01:11:07,427 --> 01:11:08,909
I've never heard of such a thing

802
01:11:09,469 --> 01:11:12,272
He said his experience told him that

803
01:11:12,673 --> 01:11:15,676
Okay then, you can bring it out
for more sunshine

804
01:11:15,796 --> 01:11:16,396
Yes

805
01:11:17,998 --> 01:11:18,839
Donghai

806
01:11:19,159 --> 01:11:21,081
You too had the same kind of bird,
didn't you?

807
01:11:21,201 --> 01:11:23,203
Remember to bring it out
for more sunshine

808
01:11:23,323 --> 01:11:24,645
So that it can sing more beautifully

809
01:11:24,725 --> 01:11:25,445
Yes

810
01:11:36,296 --> 01:11:41,021
Sad, sad

811
01:11:41,101 --> 01:11:47,908
Who makes you so sad

812
01:11:48,028 --> 01:11:54,234
Is it the budding of plum flowers,

813
01:11:54,314 --> 01:12:01,281
Or it's the rose
that didn't come into blossom

814
01:12:02,963 --> 01:12:07,247
Who, who

815
01:12:07,367 --> 01:12:14,214
Who had hurt you so much

816
01:12:14,294 --> 01:12:20,260
Even if you dry up your tears

817
01:12:20,380 --> 01:12:29,109
And bring out all your sorrow

818
01:12:29,229 --> 01:12:37,197
There's only emptiness

819
01:12:37,277 --> 01:12:44,204
The world is a place of fallacy

820
01:12:44,324 --> 01:12:50,731
So why dream in tears

821
01:12:50,851 --> 01:13:01,181
Dreaming for one that never comes

822
01:13:02,743 --> 01:13:07,708
A lie, a lie

823
01:13:07,828 --> 01:13:14,514
Where is true love if love does exist

824
01:13:14,635 --> 01:13:21,041
If you know

825
01:13:21,121 --> 01:13:31,011
Then you don't have to be sad

826
01:13:32,933 --> 01:13:36,056
Miss Qin, I would like to know

827
01:13:36,176 --> 01:13:39,259
If you have noticed any strange behavior

828
01:13:39,379 --> 01:13:40,981
...on part of Zhou Guoxiong

829
01:13:41,582 --> 01:13:43,383
Like nymphomania

830
01:13:43,784 --> 01:13:45,545
Are you trying to ask if he has ever...

831
01:13:45,666 --> 01:13:47,708
attempted to strangle me?

832
01:13:49,790 --> 01:13:51,271
So the police has already asked you that?

833
01:13:52,232 --> 01:13:53,393
A very detailed questioning indeed

834
01:13:53,714 --> 01:13:55,515
Perhaps they hoped for me to say that...

835
01:13:55,636 --> 01:13:57,758
Zhou Guoxiong has this bad habit

836
01:13:58,478 --> 01:14:01,201
but I'm sorry, he didn't

837
01:14:03,443 --> 01:14:08,008
Then... does he have other kind of
abnormal behavior

838
01:14:08,689 --> 01:14:11,131
If loving women
is not considered abnormal

839
01:14:11,251 --> 01:14:13,413
Then he's perfectly normal

840
01:14:13,734 --> 01:14:16,697
So you two frequently went on dates?

841
01:14:16,777 --> 01:14:19,459
Only once. Does that surprise you?

842
01:14:23,543 --> 01:14:26,667
I'm sorry,
but... are you Miss Guo Meiling?

843
01:14:26,787 --> 01:14:27,387
Yes!

844
01:14:30,270 --> 01:14:33,153
So you're the famous lawyer, what's up?

845
01:14:35,515 --> 01:14:38,639
Are you the ex-girlfriend of
Zhou Guoxiong?

846
01:14:38,759 --> 01:14:39,399
Yes!

847
01:14:41,001 --> 01:14:42,242
That was a year ago

848
01:14:42,362 --> 01:14:44,204
We met at the beach

849
01:14:44,484 --> 01:14:46,366
He asked me to swim with him

850
01:14:46,566 --> 01:14:48,008
He's very handsome

851
01:14:48,288 --> 01:14:49,930
He said he liked me

852
01:14:50,050 --> 01:14:52,613
And actually I liked him too

853
01:14:53,213 --> 01:14:54,855
So I accepted his invitation

854
01:15:07,668 --> 01:15:09,870
We had a wonderful time together

855
01:15:09,990 --> 01:15:12,633
Later I went with him
to a nightclub for drinks

856
01:15:21,001 --> 01:15:22,242
And what happened thereafter

857
01:15:22,322 --> 01:15:24,284
I'm sure you can imagine

858
01:15:26,406 --> 01:15:28,649
Then, according to you...

859
01:15:28,729 --> 01:15:32,212
is he really abnormal,
just as the paper described?

860
01:15:33,493 --> 01:15:35,936
I'd say he is very much normal

861
01:15:44,665 --> 01:15:45,786
Mr. And Mrs. Wang

862
01:15:47,588 --> 01:15:48,909
It's me again

863
01:15:50,310 --> 01:15:52,272
Did anyone come for Zhou Guoxiong lately?

864
01:15:53,674 --> 01:15:54,635
No one

865
01:15:54,755 --> 01:15:55,636
Really?

866
01:15:56,677 --> 01:15:58,799
Then recently did he bring anyone back

867
01:15:58,919 --> 01:16:00,480
...to this apartment?

868
01:16:00,601 --> 01:16:02,963
He usually came back late

869
01:16:03,083 --> 01:16:05,125
Moreover, he doesn't usually
stay overnight here

870
01:16:05,806 --> 01:16:06,767
No wonder

871
01:16:07,087 --> 01:16:09,249
You can't recall much about him

872
01:16:09,329 --> 01:16:11,251
He doesn't come that often, you see!

873
01:16:13,093 --> 01:16:15,896
I'm sorry, I've bothered you too much

874
01:16:16,016 --> 01:16:16,937
It doesn't matter

875
01:16:18,939 --> 01:16:19,820
Goodbye

876
01:16:31,471 --> 01:16:32,352
What?

877
01:16:32,472 --> 01:16:33,033
Nothing

878
01:17:07,868 --> 01:17:08,829
Lawyer Hong

879
01:17:10,110 --> 01:17:12,392
Miss Su, how come you're here so late

880
01:17:12,472 --> 01:17:13,393
Anything important?

881
01:17:14,234 --> 01:17:16,396
I feel uneasy at heart.
Even at home I kept tarrying

882
01:17:18,238 --> 01:17:20,240
What happened to you?
Your head is bleeding

883
01:17:24,524 --> 01:17:27,207
I almost got killed by a car

884
01:17:28,088 --> 01:17:29,249
What happened?

885
01:17:30,370 --> 01:17:32,292
I should know better

886
01:17:32,693 --> 01:17:34,855
He will come sooner or later

887
01:17:35,495 --> 01:17:39,339
I'm trying to prove that

888
01:17:39,459 --> 01:17:41,181
Zhou Guoxiong is not the murderer

889
01:17:43,223 --> 01:17:45,946
So the real murderer tries to kill me

890
01:17:46,707 --> 01:17:48,348
because I'm investigating into this case

891
01:17:48,989 --> 01:17:50,150
Then you...

892
01:17:51,151 --> 01:17:54,554
Don't worry,
this has happened to me many times

893
01:17:55,836 --> 01:17:59,039
So Miss Su, any news?

894
01:18:00,080 --> 01:18:01,962
I went to the Apartment Luoyang today

895
01:18:02,683 --> 01:18:03,764
It must be hard on you

896
01:18:04,364 --> 01:18:05,405
Did you find anything?

897
01:18:07,447 --> 01:18:08,168
No

898
01:18:09,249 --> 01:18:13,133
Same for me;
we've come up with nothing so far

899
01:18:17,778 --> 01:18:21,181
What's the use of this list of women?

900
01:18:21,982 --> 01:18:25,145
We didn't find any clue in it

901
01:18:28,148 --> 01:18:31,551
Miss Su,
besides the women on this list...

902
01:18:32,312 --> 01:18:34,554
Do you know if Zhou Guoxiong

903
01:18:34,675 --> 01:18:35,876
...has any other women?

904
01:18:38,959 --> 01:18:40,160
I really wouldn't know that

905
01:18:41,281 --> 01:18:44,885
I'm sorry. Shouldn't ask you this

906
01:18:46,647 --> 01:18:48,649
but, I've asked Guoxiong

907
01:18:49,249 --> 01:18:50,651
And he didn't tell me

908
01:18:51,131 --> 01:18:52,813
Then... will that diary be useful

909
01:18:53,333 --> 01:18:54,975
Diary? What diary?

910
01:18:55,255 --> 01:18:57,978
I mean the diary of a lady killer

911
01:19:00,060 --> 01:19:01,702
Diary?

912
01:19:02,542 --> 01:19:04,665
Yes, please tell me

913
01:19:05,505 --> 01:19:07,067
Where did you
put the diary of a lady killer?

914
01:19:09,630 --> 01:19:13,313
I think the murderer
that plotted against you...

915
01:19:13,433 --> 01:19:16,436
is related to one of your women

916
01:19:17,557 --> 01:19:20,200
Tell me! Where did you hide that diary?

917
01:19:21,401 --> 01:19:22,643
I have not hidden it

918
01:19:23,083 --> 01:19:24,084
You haven't hidden it!

919
01:19:27,287 --> 01:19:28,488
It's lost

920
01:19:29,249 --> 01:19:30,370
When?

921
01:19:32,372 --> 01:19:34,134
I remember the day when Lizhen was killed

922
01:19:34,895 --> 01:19:36,376
I had it on the desk

923
01:19:37,337 --> 01:19:38,458
When I went home

924
01:19:38,579 --> 01:19:39,700
It's already gone

925
01:19:40,420 --> 01:19:42,703
The murderer has destroyed

926
01:19:42,823 --> 01:19:44,144
All the evidence

927
01:19:46,867 --> 01:19:48,869
Mr. Zhou

928
01:19:49,509 --> 01:19:52,472
Why don't you rewrite the diary
all over again

929
01:19:53,634 --> 01:19:55,035
According to your memory

930
01:19:55,115 --> 01:19:58,158
Rewrite it word by word

931
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:02,402
Otherwise we are hopeless

932
01:20:02,482 --> 01:20:04,685
Next time when we go to Court

933
01:20:05,926 --> 01:20:07,087
If we can't produce enough evidence

934
01:20:08,969 --> 01:20:11,171
You want me to rewrite the diary
all over again

935
01:20:15,375 --> 01:20:17,738
but who will believe in what I write

936
01:20:18,538 --> 01:20:20,140
No one will believe in what I said

937
01:20:20,701 --> 01:20:25,866
Forget it! Enemy of the women,
nymphomania

938
01:20:26,186 --> 01:20:28,629
Enough of that!
before I got sentenced by the Court

939
01:20:28,709 --> 01:20:30,430
This society has already sentenced me

940
01:20:32,673 --> 01:20:33,433
Come in

941
01:20:35,075 --> 01:20:36,717
What do you want, Mr. Li?

942
01:20:39,279 --> 01:20:40,120
Nothing in particular

943
01:20:40,320 --> 01:20:42,042
I went to meet you at home,
but you weren't in

944
01:20:42,162 --> 01:20:43,283
So I came to look for you here

945
01:20:44,244 --> 01:20:45,926
How did you know I was here?

946
01:20:46,286 --> 01:20:48,448
Well... any progress with the case?

947
01:20:49,930 --> 01:20:50,570
No

948
01:20:51,091 --> 01:20:53,573
Guoxiong's appeal is a month away

949
01:20:54,094 --> 01:20:54,935
My heart is so restless now

950
01:20:55,696 --> 01:20:56,657
Of course!

951
01:20:56,737 --> 01:20:58,338
If you need anything

952
01:20:58,458 --> 01:20:59,499
Just let me know

953
01:21:00,060 --> 01:21:00,741
Thank you

954
01:21:01,662 --> 01:21:03,704
Then, I better get going. Goodbye

955
01:21:17,878 --> 01:21:19,399
You're back, Lawyer Hong

956
01:21:22,442 --> 01:21:24,004
Who is that man, one who just went out?

957
01:21:24,765 --> 01:21:26,326
He is the General Manager of
the Far East Company

958
01:21:27,367 --> 01:21:29,129
So he's the successor to Mr. Zhou!

959
01:21:29,890 --> 01:21:32,572
Just now you mentioned about
something important

960
01:21:32,693 --> 01:21:33,453
What is that?

961
01:21:34,374 --> 01:21:37,137
From his diary, Mr. Zhou recalls a woman

962
01:21:37,257 --> 01:21:40,420
...who has committed suicide

963
01:21:41,982 --> 01:21:43,824
Her name is Lin Qiuhua

964
01:21:44,665 --> 01:21:45,706
Among all those women

965
01:21:45,826 --> 01:21:47,147
She's the only one that committed suicide

966
01:21:49,309 --> 01:21:50,991
The date of her suicide

967
01:21:51,231 --> 01:21:54,074
is a month ahead of the first murder case

968
01:21:55,075 --> 01:21:58,038
You mean the suicide of Lin Qiuhua...

969
01:21:58,158 --> 01:21:59,399
has something to do with Guoxiong?

970
01:22:00,200 --> 01:22:03,804
Yes. Even though the newspapers mentioned

971
01:22:03,884 --> 01:22:07,007
She had occupational neurasthenia

972
01:22:07,567 --> 01:22:10,210
but I seriously doubt it

973
01:22:10,691 --> 01:22:12,853
So I went to the police station
to double check

974
01:22:13,694 --> 01:22:16,937
I found out that when she died...

975
01:22:17,057 --> 01:22:18,498
She is already six months pregnant

976
01:22:19,740 --> 01:22:21,982
Her sister came to inspect the body

977
01:22:29,710 --> 01:22:31,551
This is her sister's address

978
01:22:32,312 --> 01:22:34,955
I think we need to talk to...

979
01:22:35,075 --> 01:22:37,357
Lin Qiuhua's sister

980
01:22:38,999 --> 01:22:41,962
Miss Su,
I think it'd be more appropriate...

981
01:22:42,082 --> 01:22:44,725
for you women to speak to each other

982
01:22:45,085 --> 01:22:48,729
Do you mind to go?

983
01:22:51,411 --> 01:22:52,292
No problem

984
01:22:58,418 --> 01:22:59,499
Is there a Miss Lin Qiuhua

985
01:22:59,620 --> 01:23:00,661
...living in here?

986
01:23:01,101 --> 01:23:02,262
Are you asking about Miss Lin...

987
01:23:02,382 --> 01:23:04,785
who used to live on the second floor?

988
01:23:04,865 --> 01:23:07,467
Around October of last year

989
01:23:07,588 --> 01:23:09,429
Miss Lin sold all her furniture

990
01:23:09,509 --> 01:23:12,593
After that a lot of people
have moved in and out

991
01:23:13,073 --> 01:23:14,595
So nobody did pay much attention

992
01:23:14,675 --> 01:23:16,036
As of when she actually moved out

993
01:23:17,197 --> 01:23:18,759
Did anyone come to look for them?

994
01:23:19,159 --> 01:23:20,921
Let me think... oh yes

995
01:23:21,521 --> 01:23:25,005
A reporter of some magazine

996
01:23:25,686 --> 01:23:26,687
...did come two or three times

997
01:23:27,087 --> 01:23:29,449
He wanted to ask about
her sister's suicide

998
01:23:29,890 --> 01:23:32,532
After that no one came for her

999
01:23:32,653 --> 01:23:33,974
Do they have any relatives?

1000
01:23:34,094 --> 01:23:34,815
I don't think so

1001
01:23:35,295 --> 01:23:35,976
Thank you

1002
01:23:39,740 --> 01:23:42,422
Don't get upset, we're still hopeful

1003
01:23:43,463 --> 01:23:45,986
We've already put in a classified

1004
01:23:46,066 --> 01:23:47,427
I hope we'll soon get a response

1005
01:23:48,148 --> 01:23:51,672
Once Lin Hongzhu appears,
we'll have a chance

1006
01:23:54,434 --> 01:23:56,396
Hello, yes

1007
01:23:58,799 --> 01:23:59,760
Please hold on

1008
01:24:00,200 --> 01:24:02,202
Someone said last year a woman
stayed at his place

1009
01:24:02,322 --> 01:24:03,483
She might be the one we're looking for

1010
01:24:04,444 --> 01:24:05,926
Hello, where are you?

1011
01:24:08,849 --> 01:24:10,250
Apartment Jielu in Yaumatei

1012
01:24:10,811 --> 01:24:12,052
Lawyer Hong, Apartment Jielu

1013
01:24:12,172 --> 01:24:13,814
Is the one that Zhu Lizhen lived in

1014
01:24:14,975 --> 01:24:17,377
Don't worry about that, I'll come at once

1015
01:24:21,341 --> 01:24:22,743
She is a model by profession

1016
01:24:22,863 --> 01:24:24,064
She used to tour overseas to perform

1017
01:24:24,585 --> 01:24:26,667
She came back only around two days a week

1018
01:24:27,067 --> 01:24:29,469
For the past two months
she didn't come back at all

1019
01:24:30,671 --> 01:24:32,673
It's good
she has a six month deposit with me

1020
01:24:32,793 --> 01:24:34,114
So I don't worry at all

1021
01:24:35,235 --> 01:24:36,797
Where is Zhu Lizhen's room?

1022
01:24:37,958 --> 01:24:39,079
That one

1023
01:24:40,721 --> 01:24:42,202
So she just lived here!

1024
01:24:42,923 --> 01:24:45,045
I never imagined it's that close

1025
01:24:46,526 --> 01:24:47,688
Isn't this that diary?

1026
01:24:48,929 --> 01:24:50,651
This is the crucial
diary of a lady killer

1027
01:24:51,732 --> 01:24:52,733
How come it's here!

1028
01:24:54,054 --> 01:24:56,056
The most important part of this diary

1029
01:24:56,697 --> 01:24:59,179
Are the pages about Lin Qiuhua

1030
01:24:59,499 --> 01:25:00,741
How come it's been torn out?

1031
01:25:02,062 --> 01:25:05,385
In this case, Lin Hongzhu is undoubtedly

1032
01:25:05,465 --> 01:25:06,827
...the sister of Lin Qiuhua

1033
01:25:07,267 --> 01:25:08,308
Will Miss Lin come back?

1034
01:25:09,269 --> 01:25:10,430
Maybe not

1035
01:25:10,550 --> 01:25:11,191
Why?

1036
01:25:11,672 --> 01:25:14,274
because she has left the diary here

1037
01:25:14,394 --> 01:25:16,436
She is hoping that...

1038
01:25:16,556 --> 01:25:17,878
We can discover this diary

1039
01:25:19,800 --> 01:25:20,560
That's right

1040
01:25:21,321 --> 01:25:23,563
Lawyer Hong, I have this feeling too

1041
01:25:24,284 --> 01:25:26,807
If Miss Lin were the real murderer...

1042
01:25:26,927 --> 01:25:28,769
She won't leave the diary behind

1043
01:25:29,770 --> 01:25:33,213
I guess we've paid too much attention
to this diary

1044
01:25:33,333 --> 01:25:37,457
And left out the fact that
someone hates Guoxiong

1045
01:25:38,498 --> 01:25:40,180
That's true.
We ought to concentrate on notjust...

1046
01:25:40,260 --> 01:25:42,382
the women included in this diary;

1047
01:25:43,103 --> 01:25:45,586
but to a wider area

1048
01:25:45,706 --> 01:25:47,748
Let's simplify the case

1049
01:25:50,150 --> 01:25:51,912
Miss Lin hates Guoxiong

1050
01:25:52,032 --> 01:25:53,914
because he is the cause of...

1051
01:25:54,194 --> 01:25:55,596
Her sister's suicide

1052
01:25:56,396 --> 01:25:58,158
Will someone then make use of this hatred

1053
01:25:58,278 --> 01:26:01,241
...to plot against Guoxiong?!

1054
01:26:01,762 --> 01:26:03,123
Maybe this person...

1055
01:26:03,243 --> 01:26:05,886
bears a deeper grudge against Guoxiong

1056
01:26:06,566 --> 01:26:07,848
And until now

1057
01:26:07,968 --> 01:26:09,890
He is still doing something against him

1058
01:26:13,533 --> 01:26:16,456
Hello. Hold on please

1059
01:26:16,937 --> 01:26:18,458
Miss Su, your phone call

1060
01:26:18,899 --> 01:26:19,940
Seems like it's a woman

1061
01:26:20,060 --> 01:26:22,182
Calling from the Apartment Luoyang

1062
01:26:24,424 --> 01:26:27,027
Hello

1063
01:26:27,147 --> 01:26:29,429
I wanted to tell you this
the last time you came

1064
01:26:29,830 --> 01:26:31,632
Around end of last year

1065
01:26:31,872 --> 01:26:33,834
Someone called looking for Mr. Zhou

1066
01:26:34,715 --> 01:26:37,437
Yes, he said he's a newspaper reporter

1067
01:26:39,559 --> 01:26:41,241
That's right.
He asked if Mr. Zhou is at home

1068
01:26:41,722 --> 01:26:43,203
Yes, it was a man

1069
01:26:43,844 --> 01:26:44,965
What time?

1070
01:26:46,126 --> 01:26:47,848
Around December of last year

1071
01:26:48,488 --> 01:26:50,210
by that time Mr. Zhou was not at home

1072
01:26:50,290 --> 01:26:52,092
He just went out a while ago

1073
01:26:53,013 --> 01:26:54,014
What?

1074
01:26:54,294 --> 01:26:58,058
That's right, so he hung up in a hurry

1075
01:26:58,178 --> 01:27:00,060
by that time
I wasn't paying much attention

1076
01:27:00,661 --> 01:27:03,664
When I found out
Mr. Zhou is not a man of the art

1077
01:27:03,784 --> 01:27:07,107
Then I wondered, why would he call him?

1078
01:27:08,468 --> 01:27:09,630
Yes, that's right

1079
01:27:10,671 --> 01:27:12,753
What's more,
when I talked to him on the phone

1080
01:27:12,873 --> 01:27:14,514
I heard a bird singing in the background

1081
01:27:15,716 --> 01:27:17,477
I remembered talking to my husband

1082
01:27:17,598 --> 01:27:18,478
That maybe the reporter...

1083
01:27:18,599 --> 01:27:21,561
is using the phone of a bird shop

1084
01:27:21,682 --> 01:27:22,643
very good! Thank you very much

1085
01:27:25,005 --> 01:27:26,767
She said that a newspaper reporter

1086
01:27:26,887 --> 01:27:28,408
has once called Guoxiong

1087
01:27:29,289 --> 01:27:30,130
Really?

1088
01:27:30,771 --> 01:27:34,374
Seems like the reporter that
went to see Lin Hongzhu

1089
01:27:34,494 --> 01:27:35,415
Is the same person as this one

1090
01:27:49,830 --> 01:27:51,632
Is this the sound that you've heard?

1091
01:27:53,914 --> 01:27:55,876
That's right, it's this sound

1092
01:27:55,996 --> 01:27:56,957
I've no doubt about it

1093
01:27:59,479 --> 01:28:00,761
Thank you

1094
01:28:14,534 --> 01:28:18,659
Mom, do you think
Guoxiong could be acquitted?

1095
01:28:21,061 --> 01:28:23,784
I don't believe that
Guoxiong is the murderer

1096
01:28:25,866 --> 01:28:29,109
Could it be that
someone is jealous of him

1097
01:28:29,710 --> 01:28:31,792
And is making use of
his lifestyle to set a trap!

1098
01:28:31,872 --> 01:28:33,313
And one by one...

1099
01:28:33,433 --> 01:28:36,597
Killed all the women that
he once got along with!

1100
01:28:38,518 --> 01:28:41,001
Xiulan, what do you mean?

1101
01:28:41,762 --> 01:28:44,925
I was thinking,
this could be a way to harm someone

1102
01:28:46,046 --> 01:28:48,288
What kind of strange idea that you have!

1103
01:28:51,091 --> 01:28:53,253
It's getting dark.
Looks like it's going to rain soon

1104
01:29:26,927 --> 01:29:28,969
It's getting late, let me take you home!

1105
01:29:29,089 --> 01:29:31,251
No, I'm not going back

1106
01:29:33,093 --> 01:29:36,937
Don't you know what to do

1107
01:29:37,057 --> 01:29:38,018
...To win over my heart?

1108
01:29:38,458 --> 01:29:39,299
Xiulan

1109
01:30:22,062 --> 01:30:22,823
Take a seat!

1110
01:30:29,710 --> 01:30:31,311
I need some water

1111
01:30:41,361 --> 01:30:43,523
Sorry, I forgot to put some water
in the fridge

1112
01:30:43,964 --> 01:30:44,725
It's not too cold

1113
01:31:01,341 --> 01:31:03,864
Isn't this the same bird
as the one in my home?

1114
01:31:06,987 --> 01:31:08,669
You forgot that
I've brought back two of these birds

1115
01:31:08,789 --> 01:31:09,870
...from New Zealand?

1116
01:31:11,632 --> 01:31:12,593
This is a precious breed

1117
01:31:12,713 --> 01:31:14,875
I'm afraid they are the only two
in Hong Kong

1118
01:31:27,287 --> 01:31:29,449
Everyday when I hear them sing

1119
01:31:29,569 --> 01:31:31,852
I feel like being with you everyday

1120
01:31:32,052 --> 01:31:33,614
Xiulan, I love you

1121
01:31:34,454 --> 01:31:36,977
Do you know that I've loved you...

1122
01:31:37,097 --> 01:31:38,058
Since a long time back

1123
01:31:42,542 --> 01:31:45,025
Not here, take me to the room

1124
01:31:45,145 --> 01:31:45,906
Okay

1125
01:31:57,798 --> 01:31:59,159
I've always been dreaming of

1126
01:31:59,279 --> 01:32:00,641
being with you forever

1127
01:32:01,642 --> 01:32:04,484
I believe this dream will soon
become a reality

1128
01:32:06,727 --> 01:32:07,447
Don't rush

1129
01:32:07,968 --> 01:32:10,851
I love you.
I love you so much I'm getting insane

1130
01:32:11,692 --> 01:32:14,975
Do you know that Guoxiong and I
love each other too

1131
01:32:15,255 --> 01:32:17,738
Don't mention that asshole Guoxiong

1132
01:32:18,939 --> 01:32:21,822
I'm so mad when you were in love with him

1133
01:32:22,502 --> 01:32:25,746
Everyday I kept thinking;
even if I have to kill him

1134
01:32:25,866 --> 01:32:26,947
I have got to win you over

1135
01:32:27,067 --> 01:32:29,950
What? You said you have to kill Guoxiong

1136
01:32:30,070 --> 01:32:30,951
And win me over

1137
01:32:31,191 --> 01:32:32,713
Well, I did think about that

1138
01:32:32,833 --> 01:32:35,315
In order to have you,
I've already done so

1139
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:40,761
You devil!

1140
01:32:55,776 --> 01:32:56,897
You ruthless murderer

1141
01:32:58,538 --> 01:33:00,020
You killed all these innocent women

1142
01:33:00,100 --> 01:33:01,702
Just to satisfy your selfish desire

1143
01:33:08,468 --> 01:33:11,431
Stop, don't move!

1144
01:33:18,318 --> 01:33:20,400
Miss Su, are you okay?

1145
01:33:24,164 --> 01:33:25,766
I don't know since when

1146
01:33:26,607 --> 01:33:30,530
did I come to know that
I was in love with Xiulan

1147
01:33:32,212 --> 01:33:36,216
Xiulan... whenever I call this name

1148
01:33:37,097 --> 01:33:39,860
I'm thrilled with joy and excitement

1149
01:33:42,022 --> 01:33:46,026
but, when I thought about
Guoxiong and Xiulan

1150
01:33:47,267 --> 01:33:49,389
Joy turns into hatred and anger

1151
01:33:53,393 --> 01:33:57,918
So I've decided to plot against Guoxiong

1152
01:33:59,399 --> 01:34:01,161
but when I've given up Xiulan

1153
01:34:02,362 --> 01:34:04,004
And fell in love with Lin Qiuhua,

1154
01:34:06,286 --> 01:34:07,007
I found out that

1155
01:34:07,087 --> 01:34:09,610
She killed herself because of Guoxiong

1156
01:34:10,490 --> 01:34:11,692
I swear that I will avenge her

1157
01:34:15,535 --> 01:34:18,819
So I made use of Lin Hongzhu

1158
01:34:18,899 --> 01:34:20,741
who also wanted to avenge
her sister's death

1159
01:34:23,624 --> 01:34:25,425
I've designed a plan to have my revenge

1160
01:34:27,107 --> 01:34:29,029
And made him look like the suspect

1161
01:34:34,635 --> 01:34:36,196
In Guoxiong's room

1162
01:34:36,637 --> 01:34:39,479
I had read his diary of a lady-killer

1163
01:34:39,960 --> 01:34:42,402
So I started killing all those women
one by one

1164
01:34:44,484 --> 01:34:47,247
Hongzhu is frightened by my cruelty

1165
01:34:47,928 --> 01:34:50,410
She is not willing to cooperate anymore

1166
01:34:51,171 --> 01:34:52,212
but I can't let her go

1167
01:34:52,292 --> 01:34:53,413
because she knew too much

1168
01:34:55,616 --> 01:34:58,218
So after I locked her up for a few weeks

1169
01:34:59,700 --> 01:35:02,623
I've killed her too. I'm arrested today

1170
01:35:03,223 --> 01:35:04,745
Maybe I'm guilty

1171
01:35:05,345 --> 01:35:07,227
but at least I can face up to Qiuhua

1172
01:35:08,068 --> 01:35:09,189
She is waiting for me

1173
01:35:09,790 --> 01:35:11,832
In that faraway land

1174
01:35:11,952 --> 01:35:13,073
Calling for me

1175
01:35:31,091 --> 01:35:32,292
Guoxiong

1176
01:35:33,293 --> 01:35:34,214
Xiulan

1177
01:35:34,574 --> 01:35:35,656
Guoxiong

1178
01:35:44,825 --> 01:35:46,306
Please don't ever leave me again
