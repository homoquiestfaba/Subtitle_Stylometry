1
00:01:13,876 --> 00:01:15,514
I've got Talia.

2
00:01:20,996 --> 00:01:22,952
All right, let's do this thing.

3
00:01:30,996 --> 00:01:32,190
Transfer's confirmed.

4
00:01:32,276 --> 00:01:34,744
-Move in.
-That's very good.

5
00:01:35,396 --> 00:01:36,670
This is the FBl.

6
00:01:37,556 --> 00:01:40,753
The building is surrounded.
You're all under arrest.

7
00:01:42,196 --> 00:01:44,266
I repeat, you're all under arrest.

8
00:01:44,556 --> 00:01:45,989
Put your hands up.

9
00:01:47,356 --> 00:01:48,471
This is the FBl!

10
00:01:52,276 --> 00:01:55,348
Sonny Talia, you're under arrest.

11
00:01:55,636 --> 00:01:59,470
Oh, yeah? For what? lmport, export?

12
00:02:01,836 --> 00:02:05,226
Calm down, buddy.
Here's my bill of lading.

13
00:02:05,716 --> 00:02:09,504
Coffee, paint, computer chips
and lawn chairs.

14
00:02:11,156 --> 00:02:13,624
There's nothing in here but lawn chairs.

15
00:02:14,556 --> 00:02:17,070
Hey, sweetheart, you're a beautiful girl.

16
00:02:17,276 --> 00:02:18,994
If you get tired of the FBl...

17
00:02:19,076 --> 00:02:22,671
...you can come and work for me
in one of my dance joints.

18
00:02:23,316 --> 00:02:25,113
Bring in Agent 1 1 !

19
00:02:43,596 --> 00:02:44,745
Agent 1 1 ...

20
00:02:45,276 --> 00:02:46,345
...search!

21
00:03:13,916 --> 00:03:15,065
What's this?

22
00:03:18,956 --> 00:03:19,866
Go!

23
00:04:03,156 --> 00:04:04,828
Get away from me!

24
00:04:08,156 --> 00:04:09,225
Agent 1 1 !

25
00:04:43,595 --> 00:04:46,393
Bleeker Street. Dog town.

26
00:04:51,035 --> 00:04:52,787
Canine Alley.

27
00:05:09,875 --> 00:05:11,627
No, you don't.

28
00:05:16,115 --> 00:05:19,027
Come on, Spike.
Can't we do this nice, just once?

29
00:05:22,075 --> 00:05:24,305
All right. You asked for it.

30
00:05:26,755 --> 00:05:29,189
What do we got here? Go get the chicken.

31
00:05:29,315 --> 00:05:30,748
Go get the chicken.

32
00:05:38,595 --> 00:05:40,392
Psych, Spike!

33
00:05:46,515 --> 00:05:47,868
Come on, Boodles.

34
00:05:48,115 --> 00:05:50,834
We gotta stop meeting like this.
I'm telling you.

35
00:05:50,915 --> 00:05:53,349
It costs me $20 a week in meatballs.

36
00:05:54,355 --> 00:05:56,789
Let's do it again. Go get the meatball!

37
00:06:05,635 --> 00:06:08,627
Where are you?
Where is that stinking dog?

38
00:06:29,395 --> 00:06:30,748
Well, well, well.

39
00:06:34,275 --> 00:06:37,233
What's up, Tyson? You on lock-down?

40
00:06:37,395 --> 00:06:42,105
Want to get the mail?
Want to get the mailman? Come on, try!

41
00:06:51,315 --> 00:06:52,668
Too fast!

42
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:03,067
Who am l? MC Hammer! You know why?
Because you can't touch this.

43
00:07:16,675 --> 00:07:18,233
Not today, Tyson!

44
00:07:24,595 --> 00:07:28,144
Here you are, baby.
Signed, sealed, delivered.

45
00:07:28,915 --> 00:07:31,270
Thank you, Benny. I'll see you tomorrow?

46
00:07:31,355 --> 00:07:35,633
Oh, yeah. And remember,
if there's anything I can do for you...

47
00:07:35,795 --> 00:07:38,309
...all you have to do is raise that flag...

48
00:07:38,955 --> 00:07:43,346
...and I'll come through for you, baby.
Rain, sleet or snow.

49
00:07:45,395 --> 00:07:47,909
This postman always delivers.

50
00:07:49,315 --> 00:07:50,509
Damn.

51
00:07:53,755 --> 00:07:58,033
Oh, hey, Gordon. What's up, man?
You're looking smooth, brother.

52
00:07:58,675 --> 00:07:59,790
Tyson again?

53
00:08:02,355 --> 00:08:03,993
Yeah, but I'm cool.

54
00:08:04,355 --> 00:08:08,314
That dog's on an all-white-meat diet.
He never did that to no brother.

55
00:08:09,075 --> 00:08:11,714
-That's not funny.
-Yes, it is.

56
00:08:12,275 --> 00:08:16,268
Why don't you request a different route
if he's giving you a hard time?

57
00:08:16,475 --> 00:08:19,148
There's not a dog on this planet
that can scare me.

58
00:08:19,235 --> 00:08:20,429
Okay, brother.

59
00:08:26,475 --> 00:08:28,352
That's funny. That's hysterical.

60
00:08:28,435 --> 00:08:30,266
Come on, baby. They're just jokes.

61
00:08:30,355 --> 00:08:33,745
-Don't get postal on me.
-Postal? I'm not postal.

62
00:08:34,035 --> 00:08:38,153
Don't even play with me like that.
You know all white people are crazy.

63
00:08:39,235 --> 00:08:41,351
I'll check you back at the crib.

64
00:08:42,515 --> 00:08:45,109
Hey, G. You can keep that dog, dog.

65
00:08:46,435 --> 00:08:47,390
Get it, dog?

66
00:08:57,435 --> 00:08:59,391
Here's some good news, Mr. Talia.

67
00:08:59,475 --> 00:09:03,434
The metal ball bearing we inserted
to replace your missing appendage...

68
00:09:03,635 --> 00:09:06,274
...should help you maintain
a natural appearance.

69
00:09:06,355 --> 00:09:08,915
Luckily we were able
to save the other one...

70
00:09:08,995 --> 00:09:12,146
...or else we'd have to put in two,
and when you walk....

71
00:09:18,275 --> 00:09:20,425
It's just a little urological humor.

72
00:09:21,435 --> 00:09:24,984
Sonny, let it go, please!
Listen, Sonny, it's okay.

73
00:09:25,195 --> 00:09:27,755
The prosecution has
absolutely nothing on you.

74
00:09:27,835 --> 00:09:32,545
You're a businessman with a valid bill
of lading for importation.

75
00:09:32,755 --> 00:09:35,394
They can't prove
prior knowledge or possession.

76
00:09:35,475 --> 00:09:38,148
They got no case!

77
00:09:38,915 --> 00:09:41,031
I'm not worried about that right now.

78
00:09:41,115 --> 00:09:44,994
What I'm worried about is this
Agent 1 1 dog. It's always this dog.

79
00:09:45,195 --> 00:09:48,392
He made me lose $22 million
in the last three years.

80
00:09:48,595 --> 00:09:51,029
And now he made me lose, he made me....

81
00:09:51,555 --> 00:09:53,785
You know, Sonny, you only need one.

82
00:09:53,995 --> 00:09:58,432
-Then give me one of yours.
-Just looking on the bright side.

83
00:09:58,635 --> 00:10:02,753
-You can't do anything about the dog.
-Yes, I can.

84
00:10:06,675 --> 00:10:09,348
Man's best friend. Bad dog!

85
00:10:21,235 --> 00:10:22,793
I'm sorry, buddy.

86
00:10:29,755 --> 00:10:30,824
Hey, baby.

87
00:10:32,315 --> 00:10:35,910
Steph, someone has mailed you
a stuffed dog.

88
00:10:36,715 --> 00:10:39,627
Rick, the shoot for Slick and Slimy
is down the hall.

89
00:10:40,115 --> 00:10:42,390
-Gordon!
-Hey, Steph.

90
00:10:45,635 --> 00:10:48,024
This isn't a good time for me right now.

91
00:10:48,315 --> 00:10:50,431
I got James a little present here.

92
00:10:52,395 --> 00:10:57,105
Oh, my God, that's so sweet.
All he's been talking about is dogs.

93
00:10:57,315 --> 00:11:00,466
He doesn't understand
you can't have one in an apartment.

94
00:11:00,555 --> 00:11:03,831
Honey, come here.
Gordon's got something for you.

95
00:11:07,475 --> 00:11:10,433
What's up, little man?
Look what Uncle Gordon got you!

96
00:11:10,635 --> 00:11:13,752
I'm not really your uncle,
so if I kiss your mom...

97
00:11:15,275 --> 00:11:16,503
...that's okay.

98
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:21,072
Don't worry, James.
There's no chance of that happening.

99
00:11:22,435 --> 00:11:24,153
Hey, pal, what do we say?

100
00:11:25,715 --> 00:11:27,467
Thank you.

101
00:11:30,755 --> 00:11:34,350
I like dogs.
I'm gonna keep you for a long time.

102
00:11:35,555 --> 00:11:38,547
Yo, Steph. This guy's whacky.

103
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:45,710
Hello. Yeah, Daisy? Flight's at 9:00.

104
00:11:47,795 --> 00:11:49,751
You waltz in here with that toy...

105
00:11:49,835 --> 00:11:52,474
...thinking you can buy back
Stephanie through her son?

106
00:11:52,555 --> 00:11:54,511
You're mad you didn't think of it first.

107
00:11:54,595 --> 00:11:58,110
I don't have to. I'm here because
she wants a real man around the house.

108
00:11:58,195 --> 00:12:00,948
Are you gonna go arrest one
and bring him home to her?

109
00:12:01,035 --> 00:12:02,787
Okay, guys.

110
00:12:06,595 --> 00:12:08,711
Police business. I gotta go.

111
00:12:08,795 --> 00:12:10,513
I'll show you to the door.

112
00:12:25,515 --> 00:12:28,473
All right, bye now. Take care.
Don't get shot.

113
00:12:29,555 --> 00:12:30,590
-Out.
-What?

114
00:12:30,675 --> 00:12:33,826
-Out. Now. Go.
-Come on, Steph.

115
00:12:34,355 --> 00:12:36,949
You can't fight it, baby.

116
00:12:38,955 --> 00:12:40,104
I'm cool.

117
00:12:40,875 --> 00:12:41,944
Don't even start.

118
00:12:42,035 --> 00:12:46,665
You need some handcuffs instead
of them stamps. Rick got them.

119
00:12:50,355 --> 00:12:53,472
Look, G, I'm filling you, man.
Stephanie's a dime.

120
00:12:53,675 --> 00:12:55,791
A dime? What's that mean?

121
00:12:55,995 --> 00:12:57,030
A ten.

122
00:12:58,435 --> 00:13:00,505
But she comes with carry-on.

123
00:13:00,915 --> 00:13:02,064
The kid.

124
00:13:03,435 --> 00:13:04,663
What's your point?

125
00:13:04,755 --> 00:13:08,543
It's like you're dating Janet,
but Janet's bringing Tito.

126
00:13:08,755 --> 00:13:10,154
You don't want that!

127
00:13:10,235 --> 00:13:13,864
We're just friends. I'm giving
her advice on her love life.

128
00:13:14,195 --> 00:13:18,985
Love life advice? She'd be better off
calling the Psychic Friends Network.

129
00:13:19,195 --> 00:13:22,392
If you want to get with that mommy,
you got to be a pappy.

130
00:13:23,235 --> 00:13:25,795
-Are you ready for that?
-No!

131
00:13:25,995 --> 00:13:28,953
I'm cool with my current
responsibilities, thank you.

132
00:13:29,155 --> 00:13:30,224
Like what?

133
00:13:30,915 --> 00:13:32,428
Remembering to floss.

134
00:13:33,235 --> 00:13:35,146
Feeding my fish.

135
00:13:36,155 --> 00:13:40,114
And, at some point,
returning The Matrix video to Blockbuster.

136
00:13:42,035 --> 00:13:45,186
A kid abandoned in a mailbox
should jump at the chance...

137
00:13:45,275 --> 00:13:48,506
-...to screw up a family of his own.
-You have to bring that up?

138
00:13:48,595 --> 00:13:51,632
Yeah, I have to bring that up, man!
What the--

139
00:13:53,235 --> 00:13:57,547
Didn't your foster parents teach you
to respect other people's property?

140
00:13:57,715 --> 00:14:01,344
The last time I sat on this couch,
my butt was orange for a week.

141
00:14:01,555 --> 00:14:05,673
Take your dang couch out of here.
I didn't want it in the first place.

142
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:07,593
I don't have space for it.

143
00:14:07,675 --> 00:14:09,825
I'm teaching yoga in the front room.

144
00:14:10,195 --> 00:14:12,470
I don't want to hear
about you teaching yoga.

145
00:14:12,555 --> 00:14:14,546
You don't even know one yoga move.

146
00:14:14,635 --> 00:14:17,274
I can pick a $5 bill up with my butt.

147
00:14:17,515 --> 00:14:20,154
-You cannot.
-Give me $5.

148
00:14:21,275 --> 00:14:22,674
I want to see this.

149
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:25,309
You're gonna see it, baby.
You're gonna see it.

150
00:14:25,395 --> 00:14:27,147
Watch this.

151
00:14:31,835 --> 00:14:32,904
Okay.

152
00:14:33,195 --> 00:14:34,548
All right, I'm stuck.

153
00:14:34,635 --> 00:14:37,388
-You all right?
-Just come push me over. Push me.

154
00:14:37,555 --> 00:14:40,467
Just push me. Just push me to the right.

155
00:14:42,235 --> 00:14:44,305
Hey, watch the couch, baby.

156
00:14:44,515 --> 00:14:46,107
All right, come on, man.

157
00:14:48,795 --> 00:14:51,707
-Yes, I'm gonna watch football.
-You know I'm ready!

158
00:14:53,155 --> 00:14:55,669
Yeah, I'm gonna watch some football!

159
00:14:58,355 --> 00:15:02,143
Miss Maguire, I have people here.
You must come down now.

160
00:15:02,595 --> 00:15:06,907
Miss Maguire, I have people here.
You must come down now.

161
00:15:08,235 --> 00:15:10,191
Hey, what are you yelling about?

162
00:15:10,355 --> 00:15:13,950
You tell her to come down now,
because we are leaving to the airport.

163
00:15:14,035 --> 00:15:15,229
She's so slow.

164
00:15:20,875 --> 00:15:23,150
-Where you going, man?
-Nowhere, man.

165
00:15:25,155 --> 00:15:27,430
Hey, man! Gordon!

166
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:28,784
Do you mind?

167
00:15:28,995 --> 00:15:31,634
You can't take care
of the hamster I gave you.

168
00:15:31,835 --> 00:15:35,430
-What you gonna do with a woman?
-Come on, man, let me do this.

169
00:15:36,275 --> 00:15:38,231
Go handle your business then.

170
00:15:42,675 --> 00:15:43,744
What's up?

171
00:15:44,915 --> 00:15:47,668
I'm going away on business
and the babysitter's late.

172
00:15:47,755 --> 00:15:50,315
She said she'd be here in 10 minutes,
30 minutes ago.

173
00:15:50,395 --> 00:15:53,353
Okay, calm down. It's okay.
Super G's here.

174
00:15:55,675 --> 00:15:57,666
God, I hope this is you, Daisy.

175
00:15:58,115 --> 00:16:00,071
Hello? Daisy!

176
00:16:01,315 --> 00:16:05,627
You'll be here in 10 more minutes?
lf you don't get here, I'll miss my plane!

177
00:16:05,835 --> 00:16:08,190
I'll watch James until Daisy gets here.

178
00:16:08,315 --> 00:16:09,543
I don't think--

179
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:11,353
Daisy! Yeah, it's Gordon.

180
00:16:11,475 --> 00:16:13,511
Get your butt over here, girl, fast!

181
00:16:13,595 --> 00:16:14,664
There you go.

182
00:16:14,755 --> 00:16:18,350
This isn't a good idea.
You don't know anything about children.

183
00:16:18,515 --> 00:16:21,234
It's 10 minutes.
What's he going to do, dry out?

184
00:16:21,315 --> 00:16:24,432
Come on, we'll kick back,
have a couple of beers, huh?

185
00:16:26,835 --> 00:16:28,553
Okay, one beer.

186
00:16:29,875 --> 00:16:33,663
You got business to take care of.
Just relax, it's gonna be fine.

187
00:16:34,395 --> 00:16:37,546
I'll keep an eye on James
and James'll keep an eye on me.

188
00:16:40,395 --> 00:16:44,024
Daisy is on her way, so Gordon's
gonna watch you for a few minutes.

189
00:16:44,355 --> 00:16:45,993
Are you okay with that?

190
00:16:50,035 --> 00:16:51,388
-Let's go!
-Okay, okay.

191
00:16:51,475 --> 00:16:53,705
Move it! Move it now!

192
00:16:57,675 --> 00:17:01,793
This is important. Remind Daisy
to always check the food pyramid.

193
00:17:01,995 --> 00:17:05,749
This is a list of what he can watch
and when, only an hour a day, no PG.

194
00:17:05,835 --> 00:17:07,553
No video games, all right?

195
00:17:07,755 --> 00:17:11,191
You've got to make sure that
she takes him to piano and soccer.

196
00:17:11,395 --> 00:17:13,351
Look, it's all in the schedule.

197
00:17:13,715 --> 00:17:16,513
All the shaded green areas
are all free playtime.

198
00:17:16,635 --> 00:17:20,310
Daisy knows all this, right?
She's been watching him for two years.

199
00:17:20,475 --> 00:17:22,113
Right. You're right. Okay.

200
00:17:22,195 --> 00:17:26,711
Mommy will be home tomorrow, and
when Mommy's away who do we listen to?

201
00:17:26,915 --> 00:17:29,304
-Daisy.
-Right. And remember, follow....

202
00:17:29,515 --> 00:17:32,075
"Follow the rules and playtime will follow."

203
00:17:32,275 --> 00:17:33,230
Got it.

204
00:17:33,675 --> 00:17:35,267
I love you.

205
00:17:35,475 --> 00:17:39,468
-Gordon, you're a lifesaver.
-Yeah, all five flavors.

206
00:17:40,155 --> 00:17:41,907
All people waiting for you!

207
00:17:43,355 --> 00:17:47,234
Don't make smoochie-smoochie.
Everybody, put on seat belts!

208
00:17:56,915 --> 00:17:59,634
All right, there it goes! Run, baby, run!

209
00:18:00,435 --> 00:18:02,187
Knock him on his ass!

210
00:18:03,915 --> 00:18:06,509
My bad. Knock him to the asphalt!

211
00:18:06,715 --> 00:18:08,467
Knock him to the asphalt!

212
00:18:09,115 --> 00:18:12,505
I hope the babysitter gets here soon
so we can go to the big screen.

213
00:18:12,595 --> 00:18:14,153
I know.

214
00:18:18,755 --> 00:18:22,589
Hello? Daisy, yeah, it's Gordon.
Where are you?

215
00:18:23,795 --> 00:18:25,706
What do you mean, you can't come?

216
00:18:25,795 --> 00:18:28,184
The game's on. Get your butt over here.

217
00:18:29,835 --> 00:18:31,063
Food poisoning?

218
00:18:34,675 --> 00:18:38,509
Daisy, listen, you can have
food poisoning over here...

219
00:18:38,675 --> 00:18:39,869
...with James.

220
00:18:42,555 --> 00:18:44,830
I don't understand what you're saying.

221
00:18:50,995 --> 00:18:52,747
I don't think she's coming.

222
00:18:53,795 --> 00:18:54,910
Don't worry.

223
00:18:54,995 --> 00:18:58,192
Your mom'll be back tomorrow,
and Benny will hang with us.

224
00:18:59,675 --> 00:19:01,506
You're hanging yourself fine.

225
00:19:02,995 --> 00:19:05,145
Remember, if he gets scared, cries...

226
00:19:05,235 --> 00:19:07,669
...or messes his drawers, give me a call.

227
00:19:08,235 --> 00:19:09,953
Benny, he's gonna be fine.

228
00:19:10,155 --> 00:19:12,874
I wasn't talking to you,
I was talking to him.

229
00:19:13,075 --> 00:19:16,590
James, if he goes to the bathroom
longer than five minutes...

230
00:19:16,755 --> 00:19:18,108
...light a match.

231
00:19:19,795 --> 00:19:23,788
I'll be watching the big screen!
You're on your own, dog!

232
00:19:24,075 --> 00:19:26,509
That ain't funny. Benny!

233
00:19:55,195 --> 00:19:56,389
I'm hungry.

234
00:19:56,595 --> 00:19:59,792
Good. Okay, food, I could do that.

235
00:20:01,595 --> 00:20:04,712
-Come on, kid.
-I can't have breakfast now.

236
00:20:05,595 --> 00:20:08,063
-Why not?
-It's dinnertime.

237
00:20:09,555 --> 00:20:10,544
So?

238
00:20:10,755 --> 00:20:12,393
I don't know about this.

239
00:20:26,555 --> 00:20:28,546
Doesn't your mommy make you clean?

240
00:20:28,635 --> 00:20:32,548
Occasionally, I take a flamethrower
to it and start all over again.

241
00:20:32,755 --> 00:20:34,154
What's that smell?

242
00:20:35,475 --> 00:20:37,193
That's the smell of a man.

243
00:20:38,035 --> 00:20:40,947
It's what a man's place smells like.

244
00:20:41,155 --> 00:20:42,986
But listen. Come over here.

245
00:20:43,475 --> 00:20:46,547
We gotta go over some rules here.
Listen carefully.

246
00:20:48,155 --> 00:20:50,305
This is my stuff.

247
00:20:51,395 --> 00:20:52,510
Look at it.

248
00:20:52,795 --> 00:20:56,913
It's beautiful. It's 500 watts
of Dolby Digital sound.

249
00:20:58,275 --> 00:21:01,824
Stereo, receiver, DVD player.
The tower of power!

250
00:21:02,435 --> 00:21:03,629
Check it out.

251
00:21:05,395 --> 00:21:06,589
Don't touch it.

252
00:21:06,875 --> 00:21:10,026
You hear that? Can you feel it, baby?

253
00:21:12,395 --> 00:21:15,990
-Say, "Don't touch Gordon's stuff."
-"Don't touch Gordon's stuff."

254
00:21:16,195 --> 00:21:18,550
We're gonna get along just fine.

255
00:21:19,715 --> 00:21:20,784
Here we go.

256
00:21:20,875 --> 00:21:24,754
Some natural whole-bran cereal,
just like the chart says...

257
00:21:24,955 --> 00:21:26,866
...and some soy milk.

258
00:21:33,355 --> 00:21:35,152
Hold it now, hold it now.

259
00:21:35,555 --> 00:21:37,466
Can't forget your prunes.

260
00:21:39,315 --> 00:21:41,875
All right, dig in.

261
00:21:48,835 --> 00:21:52,589
-Your mom ever say anything about me?
-I heard her with Daisy.

262
00:21:52,755 --> 00:21:57,545
Listening in to your mom's conversations?
That's good.

263
00:21:58,355 --> 00:22:01,028
-What'd she say?
-She said that you're funny.

264
00:22:01,235 --> 00:22:04,307
Funny? Funny, that's good.

265
00:22:04,515 --> 00:22:06,426
Yeah, we like funny.

266
00:22:07,155 --> 00:22:10,113
-What else?
-That you're irresponsible.

267
00:22:10,595 --> 00:22:12,108
Irresponsible?

268
00:22:12,275 --> 00:22:14,709
Irresponsible, waste your time...

269
00:22:14,915 --> 00:22:17,224
...and you only want one thing.

270
00:22:17,435 --> 00:22:20,268
Oh, and you're some kind of hound.

271
00:22:24,995 --> 00:22:26,348
She said that?

272
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:32,471
What's she got you eating here?

273
00:22:49,555 --> 00:22:50,590
It's good.

274
00:23:01,875 --> 00:23:03,354
How can you eat that?

275
00:23:07,435 --> 00:23:10,188
"No sugar added"?
And they're proud of that?

276
00:23:12,795 --> 00:23:16,754
I want to tell you about this man I know.
His name's Cap'n Crunch.

277
00:23:17,235 --> 00:23:18,748
He's got some friends, too.

278
00:23:18,835 --> 00:23:22,430
Count Chocula and Toucan Sam.

279
00:23:25,075 --> 00:23:26,224
Froot Loops.

280
00:23:28,595 --> 00:23:30,233
I'm not allowed.

281
00:23:33,075 --> 00:23:36,954
Wait, wait. You see, the warden's away.

282
00:23:37,155 --> 00:23:41,831
Just us guys here. We hunt,
we gather, we eat what we want.

283
00:23:43,435 --> 00:23:45,073
What if my mom finds out?

284
00:23:45,755 --> 00:23:47,473
I won't tell if you don't.

285
00:23:58,835 --> 00:24:01,474
I see why it says
I shouldn't have given you sugar.

286
00:24:09,235 --> 00:24:10,873
Those are live animals!

287
00:24:12,235 --> 00:24:13,384
Catch me!

288
00:24:24,675 --> 00:24:26,950
I want this Agent 1 1 taken out.

289
00:24:28,595 --> 00:24:31,667
I don't know.
An FBI agent could be a little tricky.

290
00:24:34,475 --> 00:24:35,828
This guy is huge!

291
00:24:36,115 --> 00:24:40,267
Not him, you moron. The dog.
Agent 1 1 is a dog.

292
00:24:45,195 --> 00:24:49,234
That's funny. That's a good one, Sonny.
That's a good one.

293
00:24:49,475 --> 00:24:51,431
You want we should whack a dog?

294
00:24:52,835 --> 00:24:55,349
You two tubs of blubber think that's funny?

295
00:24:57,555 --> 00:25:00,513
-There's no reason to get personal.
-This is personal!

296
00:25:00,715 --> 00:25:04,708
It don't get no more personal!
I want the dog dead!

297
00:25:04,915 --> 00:25:06,587
All right, all right, Sonny.

298
00:25:06,675 --> 00:25:08,552
But, you know, we're pros.

299
00:25:08,755 --> 00:25:11,633
How we gonna hold our heads up
in the community...

300
00:25:11,835 --> 00:25:15,544
...with people knowing we're going
around to put the whack on a pooch?

301
00:25:15,635 --> 00:25:17,591
I mean, we got an image.

302
00:25:17,995 --> 00:25:21,067
If the two of you don't whack this pooch...

303
00:25:22,675 --> 00:25:24,552
...then you will get whacked.

304
00:25:25,955 --> 00:25:27,752
Okay. You're the boss.

305
00:25:27,955 --> 00:25:29,104
No problem.

306
00:25:30,795 --> 00:25:32,433
Do regular fees apply?

307
00:25:32,595 --> 00:25:34,153
-Come on.
-What'd I say?

308
00:25:35,555 --> 00:25:37,273
It is important that your dog...

309
00:25:37,355 --> 00:25:38,424
You see him?

310
00:25:38,515 --> 00:25:39,743
...know work ethic.

311
00:25:39,835 --> 00:25:41,587
It's a bunch of puppies.

312
00:25:42,235 --> 00:25:44,430
But he also wants to please you.

313
00:25:44,595 --> 00:25:48,747
Teach him to work, to work well,
and in the end that is all he will want.

314
00:25:49,315 --> 00:25:52,273
-Michaels, what are you doing?
-Nothing, sir.

315
00:25:52,475 --> 00:25:54,033
Is Agent 44 your pet?

316
00:25:54,115 --> 00:25:55,434
-No, sir.
-He's not.

317
00:25:55,515 --> 00:25:57,392
-He's an FBI agent.
-Yes, sir.

318
00:25:57,755 --> 00:26:01,225
-You wouldn't tickle an agent's belly.
-No, sir.

319
00:26:01,475 --> 00:26:06,026
You don't see me tickling
Agent Cassavettes' underbelly, do you?

320
00:26:06,235 --> 00:26:07,350
No, you do not!

321
00:26:07,435 --> 00:26:10,154
Get this through your head!
This is not a drill!

322
00:26:10,395 --> 00:26:15,105
These dogs will save your life.
Agent 1 1 saved mine several times.

323
00:26:15,315 --> 00:26:17,226
So don't tickle my animals.

324
00:26:17,435 --> 00:26:20,666
All canine agents wear
an lnvisible Fence collar...

325
00:26:20,875 --> 00:26:23,787
...which gives a shock designed
to get his attention.

326
00:26:24,275 --> 00:26:26,869
Since we work exclusively
with hand signals...

327
00:26:26,955 --> 00:26:30,664
...sometimes it is necessary
to prompt the dog to look back.

328
00:26:30,875 --> 00:26:32,752
This causes serious discomfort.

329
00:26:32,835 --> 00:26:34,188
For the dog's safety...

330
00:26:34,275 --> 00:26:37,745
...the collar has a voltage regulator
to prevent power surges.

331
00:26:37,955 --> 00:26:42,312
Never introduce a metal object
or you'll light your animal up.

332
00:26:43,795 --> 00:26:48,425
A demonstration of the collar by
the most decorated canine in FBI history.

333
00:26:49,235 --> 00:26:50,827
-That's him!
-You sure?

334
00:26:51,155 --> 00:26:55,785
Oh, yeah. Yeah, a little older maybe,
but that's him.

335
00:26:56,115 --> 00:26:57,104
Attack!

336
00:26:58,235 --> 00:26:59,953
Come to Papa. Now!

337
00:27:04,315 --> 00:27:07,307
-You said, "Now."
-I meant now "now," not "now"!

338
00:27:09,955 --> 00:27:13,743
Word on the street is Sonny Talia
put the hit out on Agent 1 1 .

339
00:27:13,955 --> 00:27:15,786
Not that we're surprised.

340
00:27:15,955 --> 00:27:20,631
If Talia can infiltrate our training facility,
Agent 1 1 isn't safe here.

341
00:27:23,315 --> 00:27:26,193
I've decided to call Witness Protection
in on this.

342
00:27:26,835 --> 00:27:29,588
Agent Murdoch, Agent Sharp.

343
00:27:30,155 --> 00:27:33,545
-This is a highly unusual--
-Agent Sharp, Agent 1 1 .

344
00:27:43,315 --> 00:27:46,830
This is a highly unusual request.

345
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:51,548
But the agency is very concerned.

346
00:27:51,755 --> 00:27:56,067
To be able to do something like this,
Talia must have a man on the inside....

347
00:27:59,635 --> 00:28:04,425
Until we learn who that is,
we will be relocating Agent 1 1 ...

348
00:28:04,635 --> 00:28:06,432
...to a protected environment.

349
00:28:06,515 --> 00:28:09,985
-Okay, so where will we be going?
-Not "we."

350
00:28:10,195 --> 00:28:11,833
Agent 1 1 is going alone.

351
00:28:12,435 --> 00:28:16,587
-So you're taking him away from me?
-Let it go. It's for his own good.

352
00:28:16,755 --> 00:28:19,747
But we're a team.
Agent 1 1 is my most important tool.

353
00:28:20,275 --> 00:28:22,789
What would I be without him?
Nothing at all!

354
00:28:22,875 --> 00:28:26,345
You can't take him away from me!
That's like taking away my gun!

355
00:28:33,475 --> 00:28:34,908
That'll be fine.

356
00:29:12,115 --> 00:29:13,548
Hey, little buddy.

357
00:29:13,795 --> 00:29:16,025
Little hair of the dog that bit you.

358
00:29:24,595 --> 00:29:26,472
I feel better.

359
00:29:37,555 --> 00:29:41,309
-Where's your school?
-I don't have school. It's summer.

360
00:29:41,555 --> 00:29:43,307
Guess I'll take you to my work.

361
00:29:43,395 --> 00:29:46,148
I get to deliver the mail!

362
00:29:46,355 --> 00:29:47,151
Great.

363
00:29:51,195 --> 00:29:53,709
At least tell me where he's going.

364
00:29:54,675 --> 00:29:56,552
There's no harm in that, I guess.

365
00:29:56,635 --> 00:30:00,753
He's going to an FBI sled dog
training facility in Alaska.

366
00:30:05,595 --> 00:30:07,313
Watch yourself up there.

367
00:30:08,195 --> 00:30:09,230
Okay, boy?

368
00:30:10,835 --> 00:30:12,154
Come on, get in.

369
00:30:20,595 --> 00:30:21,789
I'll take those.

370
00:30:21,875 --> 00:30:24,548
Don't worry, Murdoch, okay? He'll be fine.

371
00:30:24,755 --> 00:30:26,825
Yeah, he better be.

372
00:30:41,675 --> 00:30:43,154
Message from Sonny:

373
00:30:45,235 --> 00:30:46,953
"Play dead."

374
00:30:50,795 --> 00:30:53,229
The dog is in the third van.

375
00:31:10,075 --> 00:31:12,828
Remember, you're not supposed to be
in the truck.

376
00:31:13,235 --> 00:31:15,066
It's against regulations.

377
00:31:15,275 --> 00:31:18,108
So just stay low and make yourself useful.

378
00:31:18,315 --> 00:31:21,352
Divide those stacks of letters
into odd and even numbers.

379
00:31:21,435 --> 00:31:23,426
-Okay.
-Thanks, pal.

380
00:31:32,435 --> 00:31:33,663
Pull alongside.

381
00:31:33,795 --> 00:31:35,865
I'll whack the driver, then the dog.

382
00:31:35,955 --> 00:31:37,707
Gotcha. Whoa!

383
00:31:39,155 --> 00:31:40,747
When it's safe.

384
00:31:43,315 --> 00:31:44,714
Ease up alongside.

385
00:31:54,235 --> 00:31:55,634
Get the dog!

386
00:31:55,795 --> 00:31:57,069
Drive the car!

387
00:32:00,955 --> 00:32:03,025
Hey, buddy, I'll be right back.

388
00:32:03,235 --> 00:32:04,827
Don't go anywhere.

389
00:32:26,995 --> 00:32:27,950
Hi.

390
00:32:42,515 --> 00:32:44,028
How you doing back there?

391
00:32:44,115 --> 00:32:46,026
Gordon, is this your dog?

392
00:32:46,835 --> 00:32:48,314
No, that's your dog.

393
00:32:49,275 --> 00:32:50,594
Mine?

394
00:32:50,795 --> 00:32:53,025
Yeah, I gave him to you, remember?

395
00:32:53,235 --> 00:32:55,590
Cool. What's his name?

396
00:32:56,755 --> 00:32:59,189
Spot. The dog's name's Spot.

397
00:32:59,795 --> 00:33:01,547
Spot?

398
00:33:04,475 --> 00:33:07,467
Yo, Cleavis! What's up, brother?

399
00:33:20,755 --> 00:33:22,188
Oh, man!

400
00:33:23,675 --> 00:33:24,869
James!

401
00:33:25,075 --> 00:33:26,667
James!

402
00:33:29,155 --> 00:33:30,508
James, come here.

403
00:33:32,595 --> 00:33:34,426
You okay? Any broken bones?

404
00:33:34,515 --> 00:33:35,743
-I'm fine.
-Good!

405
00:33:35,835 --> 00:33:37,985
-Whose dog is that?
-That's my dog.

406
00:33:38,475 --> 00:33:39,464
Your dog?

407
00:33:39,675 --> 00:33:41,506
-Don't lie to me!
-I'm not.

408
00:33:41,715 --> 00:33:44,024
It's my dog, Spot. You gave him to me.

409
00:33:48,915 --> 00:33:51,031
I did not give you a dog.

410
00:33:54,435 --> 00:33:55,584
What?

411
00:33:56,075 --> 00:33:57,667
Hey, Stephanie.

412
00:33:57,875 --> 00:34:00,184
I've been leaving you messages all night.

413
00:34:00,275 --> 00:34:01,833
I know. Is James okay?

414
00:34:01,915 --> 00:34:04,429
Yeah, the kid's fine. Everything's cool.

415
00:34:04,755 --> 00:34:08,225
I can't believe this. I shouldn't
have left him. I have to get back.

416
00:34:08,315 --> 00:34:09,987
So you'll be here in two hours?

417
00:34:10,075 --> 00:34:11,394
No, I'm not.

418
00:34:11,595 --> 00:34:13,631
There's been some freak blizzard.

419
00:34:13,715 --> 00:34:15,592
The flights are canceled...

420
00:34:15,795 --> 00:34:18,263
...roads are closed,
even cell phones don't work.

421
00:34:18,355 --> 00:34:19,947
People are going insane.

422
00:34:20,915 --> 00:34:22,348
Everyone, back off!

423
00:34:23,795 --> 00:34:25,865
I don't think you can handle this.

424
00:34:25,955 --> 00:34:28,025
I'm coming. Somehow, I'm coming.

425
00:34:28,195 --> 00:34:31,153
What do you mean I can't handle
something like this?

426
00:34:31,315 --> 00:34:33,783
You think I'm irresponsible.

427
00:34:33,995 --> 00:34:38,034
Well, for your information,
I'm a very responsible guy.

428
00:34:38,235 --> 00:34:41,545
I'm going to call Beverly
and see if she can take James.

429
00:34:41,835 --> 00:34:45,191
Well, go ahead and do that.
That's probably a good idea.

430
00:34:45,395 --> 00:34:47,511
But if you need me, I'm here.

431
00:34:50,275 --> 00:34:52,106
Can I talk to James, please?

432
00:34:52,875 --> 00:34:55,594
Yeah, sure. Hold on.

433
00:34:57,315 --> 00:34:58,828
Listen...

434
00:34:58,915 --> 00:35:01,190
...don't tell her about this. It's guy stuff.

435
00:35:01,275 --> 00:35:03,152
Don't mention the accident...

436
00:35:03,475 --> 00:35:06,194
...and don't say anything about the D-O-G.

437
00:35:08,835 --> 00:35:12,032
Hi, Mom. Gordon got me a dog.

438
00:35:12,915 --> 00:35:15,110
I know, I saw him before I left.

439
00:35:15,315 --> 00:35:17,306
His name is Spot. Can I keep him?

440
00:35:17,395 --> 00:35:19,147
Yeah, you sure can.

441
00:35:19,315 --> 00:35:20,873
Wow! Thanks, Mom!

442
00:35:35,155 --> 00:35:37,589
I wonder, is Agent 1 1 all right up there?

443
00:35:37,795 --> 00:35:41,708
We've never been apart.
I feel like a part of me is missing.

444
00:35:45,435 --> 00:35:47,073
Cassavettes.

445
00:35:47,995 --> 00:35:51,032
What do you mean,
he jumped out of the van? Which van?

446
00:35:55,955 --> 00:35:58,025
No problem. That wasn't our dog.

447
00:35:58,195 --> 00:36:01,153
That was a decoy.
Let the local dogcatcher handle it.

448
00:36:02,515 --> 00:36:03,789
Check on him.

449
00:36:04,475 --> 00:36:06,989
Murdoch, he's fine. It wasn't him.

450
00:36:18,715 --> 00:36:20,546
FBI substation, Nome.

451
00:36:20,755 --> 00:36:21,790
Danvers...

452
00:36:21,875 --> 00:36:23,388
...this is the Tiger.

453
00:36:23,475 --> 00:36:25,306
Hi, Murdoch. How you doing?

454
00:36:26,355 --> 00:36:30,143
Don't use my real name, man.
I don't know if this line is secure.

455
00:36:30,355 --> 00:36:31,470
Sorry.

456
00:36:31,635 --> 00:36:33,034
What's up, Tigger?

457
00:36:33,115 --> 00:36:36,266
It's Tiger, and has the package arrived?

458
00:36:36,435 --> 00:36:38,107
He's here, yeah.

459
00:36:38,315 --> 00:36:41,944
Are you sure this is an FBI dog?
He doesn't look like much.

460
00:36:42,155 --> 00:36:45,147
Listen, 1 1 is the top canine agent
in America...

461
00:36:45,355 --> 00:36:48,153
...and probably the world. He is a killer.

462
00:36:48,435 --> 00:36:49,868
Okay.

463
00:37:00,595 --> 00:37:02,984
That didn't impress you all? Okay.

464
00:37:03,395 --> 00:37:04,874
Yeah! Look at that!

465
00:37:05,075 --> 00:37:06,190
What?

466
00:37:09,555 --> 00:37:12,911
See? You're in trouble now.
There comes my boy right there.

467
00:37:14,115 --> 00:37:16,106
My boy's always got my back.

468
00:37:16,315 --> 00:37:18,226
Hold on right there. Hold on!

469
00:37:19,315 --> 00:37:22,512
-Benny, what's going down?
-Just on my 15-minute break.

470
00:37:22,715 --> 00:37:25,309
-But I don't back down.
-They calling you out?

471
00:37:25,395 --> 00:37:27,784
-You got my back?
-Let's get disgruntled.

472
00:37:43,435 --> 00:37:45,710
Okay. I'll give you that.

473
00:37:45,915 --> 00:37:48,065
I give you that. What else you got?

474
00:37:51,195 --> 00:37:53,834
Little something I call
"The George Jefferson."

475
00:37:57,155 --> 00:37:58,873
Yeah, that's it!

476
00:37:59,075 --> 00:38:01,953
-Call Weezie!
-Weezie!

477
00:38:03,995 --> 00:38:05,826
Put the mail in the box!

478
00:38:06,035 --> 00:38:08,265
E.T., the Extra-Terrestrial.

479
00:38:10,075 --> 00:38:12,111
-Make him phone home!
-Phone home.

480
00:38:12,315 --> 00:38:15,034
-Make him phone home!
-Phone home!

481
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:19,626
There you go! Break it down!

482
00:38:24,035 --> 00:38:26,310
Grab them! Get dizzy on them!

483
00:38:28,795 --> 00:38:32,470
-Don't get dizzy, make them dizzy!
-Air Gordon, baby!

484
00:38:35,515 --> 00:38:38,188
You know what?
This is how I shut the club down.

485
00:38:38,395 --> 00:38:40,226
Yeah, you want some of this?

486
00:38:48,315 --> 00:38:51,307
You see the expression on that dog's face?

487
00:38:51,595 --> 00:38:54,348
It wasn't a scowl.
It was more like a smirk.

488
00:38:54,555 --> 00:38:56,625
It was like he was smirking at us.

489
00:38:56,755 --> 00:39:00,589
Yeah, well, I can't even believe that
I'm doing this.

490
00:39:02,595 --> 00:39:03,584
What?

491
00:39:03,795 --> 00:39:05,467
Give me the good news.

492
00:39:07,515 --> 00:39:10,587
Listen, that skirt
from the Witness Protection Program...

493
00:39:10,675 --> 00:39:13,235
...she gave us some bad information.

494
00:39:13,395 --> 00:39:15,625
So we kind of...

495
00:39:15,795 --> 00:39:17,467
...followed the wrong dog.

496
00:39:17,555 --> 00:39:20,592
But don't worry,
because we got it all figured out.

497
00:39:20,795 --> 00:39:24,754
We know where her mistake was.
We'll have the dog by the morning.

498
00:39:25,395 --> 00:39:26,874
I know you all my life.

499
00:39:26,955 --> 00:39:28,866
We grew up on the same block.

500
00:39:29,075 --> 00:39:31,031
Your mother changed my diapers.

501
00:39:31,155 --> 00:39:33,464
Your sister's married to my goombah...

502
00:39:33,675 --> 00:39:37,384
...and I'll personally shove you
headfirst into an incinerator...

503
00:39:37,595 --> 00:39:39,631
...and burn you to a crisp...

504
00:39:39,835 --> 00:39:41,473
...if you screw this up!

505
00:39:42,195 --> 00:39:45,824
This is good. You ought to have some
of this with the tomato.

506
00:39:46,035 --> 00:39:48,469
Oh, boy. If this ever gets out....

507
00:39:48,675 --> 00:39:51,633
Hey, you didn't say nothing to nobody,
did you?

508
00:39:51,795 --> 00:39:53,069
No!

509
00:39:53,275 --> 00:39:54,708
Well, I told Paulie.

510
00:39:54,795 --> 00:39:56,865
You told Paulie?

511
00:39:57,115 --> 00:39:58,468
He's a gossip.

512
00:39:58,675 --> 00:40:01,314
I had to. I was supposed
to do that thing in Atlanta.

513
00:40:01,395 --> 00:40:04,353
-He promised he'll keep his mouth shut.
-Yeah, right.

514
00:40:04,595 --> 00:40:06,313
Let's go to the dog pound.

515
00:40:06,515 --> 00:40:07,470
Big mouth!

516
00:40:07,555 --> 00:40:09,034
Nobody will know nothing.

517
00:40:09,115 --> 00:40:10,867
Charlie the Clip from Jersey.

518
00:40:10,955 --> 00:40:12,434
-Gino--
-Shut up!

519
00:40:12,595 --> 00:40:15,826
Vinny Bash from Brooklyn. Eddie Sharp.

520
00:40:16,035 --> 00:40:18,833
Oh, Joey BB Eyes!

521
00:40:20,595 --> 00:40:22,108
I don't want to leave him here.

522
00:40:22,195 --> 00:40:24,026
You don't want a dog. Trust me.

523
00:40:24,115 --> 00:40:25,867
I want Spot.

524
00:40:26,035 --> 00:40:27,866
This dog isn't Spot, it....

525
00:40:28,075 --> 00:40:30,509
This dog doesn't even
have one spot on him.

526
00:40:30,795 --> 00:40:33,389
Doesn't matter. It's just a name.

527
00:40:33,555 --> 00:40:35,466
Come on. You don't want a dog.

528
00:40:37,035 --> 00:40:38,150
Dogs stink!

529
00:40:39,355 --> 00:40:41,664
You gotta feed and walk and clean them.

530
00:40:41,795 --> 00:40:44,184
They poop everywhere. Even in your bed.

531
00:40:45,675 --> 00:40:48,951
James, I'm a mailman. Mailmen hate dogs.

532
00:40:51,955 --> 00:40:54,515
I won't have a dog in my house. I'm sorry.

533
00:40:54,715 --> 00:40:56,194
It'll never happen.

534
00:40:56,395 --> 00:40:58,306
What will happen to him?

535
00:41:19,115 --> 00:41:21,549
-What's he doing?
-I don't know.

536
00:41:24,915 --> 00:41:26,234
The dog's weird.

537
00:41:35,155 --> 00:41:37,908
Know what, dog?
You're giving me the creeps.

538
00:41:39,195 --> 00:41:41,265
What's wrong with him?

539
00:41:41,795 --> 00:41:42,830
I got it!

540
00:41:43,675 --> 00:41:45,711
We'll play catch, okay?

541
00:41:45,875 --> 00:41:47,354
Okay, catch the ball.

542
00:41:51,795 --> 00:41:53,308
Let's try that again.

543
00:41:54,355 --> 00:41:56,107
Watch the ball.

544
00:41:59,195 --> 00:42:00,548
Are you serious?

545
00:42:02,035 --> 00:42:04,595
What's wrong with you?
Why don't you play?

546
00:42:05,795 --> 00:42:07,945
No play.

547
00:42:08,155 --> 00:42:09,110
No.

548
00:42:09,315 --> 00:42:11,351
Do you hear me, Agent 1 1? No.

549
00:42:11,555 --> 00:42:14,592
Bad agent. We don't do that. No.

550
00:42:14,795 --> 00:42:15,944
Hello!

551
00:42:16,115 --> 00:42:18,310
Is anybody home?

552
00:42:18,755 --> 00:42:19,824
Okay, look...

553
00:42:19,915 --> 00:42:22,827
...l'm gonna do
what you're supposed to do.

554
00:42:23,035 --> 00:42:25,390
Check it out. I'll take your collar...

555
00:42:25,875 --> 00:42:27,945
...and I'm gonna be a dog.

556
00:42:28,715 --> 00:42:31,309
As a matter of fact, I'm gonna be you.

557
00:42:31,515 --> 00:42:33,790
A big, stupid dog.

558
00:42:35,075 --> 00:42:36,110
Look.

559
00:42:36,315 --> 00:42:37,668
I can sit.

560
00:42:38,275 --> 00:42:39,708
I can lay down.

561
00:42:47,595 --> 00:42:50,632
Well, I can't scratch my head,
but Benny probably could.

562
00:42:50,715 --> 00:42:52,114
I can lick my...

563
00:42:53,435 --> 00:42:54,504
...paw.

564
00:42:55,595 --> 00:42:57,551
Watch me, I can chase my tail.

565
00:42:57,755 --> 00:42:59,313
I'm chasing my tail.

566
00:43:01,355 --> 00:43:03,505
He's so weird.

567
00:43:05,635 --> 00:43:07,034
Oh, God.

568
00:43:09,475 --> 00:43:11,705
I don't know what to tell you, James.

569
00:43:11,915 --> 00:43:13,871
You're not trying hard enough.

570
00:43:14,075 --> 00:43:15,474
Are you kidding?

571
00:43:15,755 --> 00:43:17,188
I mean, come on...

572
00:43:17,395 --> 00:43:19,272
...the dog doesn't want to play.

573
00:43:19,355 --> 00:43:20,583
Dog's broken.

574
00:43:20,675 --> 00:43:22,313
You didn't try hard enough.

575
00:43:22,395 --> 00:43:23,794
I'm about to throw up!

576
00:43:23,875 --> 00:43:25,547
I didn't try hard enough.

577
00:43:25,675 --> 00:43:28,030
It's not my fault this dog is broke!

578
00:43:28,235 --> 00:43:30,271
Maybe when your mom gets back...

579
00:43:30,475 --> 00:43:33,035
...she can get you a dog
that actually works!

580
00:43:33,235 --> 00:43:35,385
Why don't you watch TV or something?

581
00:43:35,595 --> 00:43:38,632
Keep it on cartoons.
Don't try to get smart.

582
00:43:41,675 --> 00:43:44,394
Thank you.
Now quietly entertain yourself.

583
00:43:44,555 --> 00:43:45,908
Yeah, this'll do.

584
00:43:48,915 --> 00:43:51,907
Look, Brain! I made a round bird.

585
00:43:52,115 --> 00:43:54,549
Gotta get this stupid dog collar
off my neck!

586
00:43:54,635 --> 00:43:57,707
Birdy, birdy, birdy! Narf!

587
00:44:27,475 --> 00:44:28,590
No!

588
00:44:33,035 --> 00:44:34,673
James, put that down!

589
00:44:35,315 --> 00:44:37,067
James, put that down.

590
00:44:37,235 --> 00:44:38,827
Say we'll keep Spot.

591
00:44:39,035 --> 00:44:40,548
We can't. He's not--

592
00:44:41,275 --> 00:44:44,073
Okay, okay! You can keep the dog.

593
00:44:50,675 --> 00:44:52,506
Here we go! You ready?

594
00:44:53,235 --> 00:44:54,827
Go get it, girl!

595
00:44:56,635 --> 00:44:58,353
Hey, there.

596
00:44:58,515 --> 00:44:59,743
That's him.

597
00:45:05,795 --> 00:45:07,308
Wrong dog.

598
00:45:11,315 --> 00:45:13,146
Do you mind?

599
00:45:13,475 --> 00:45:16,114
I gotta take these two creatures
to the park...

600
00:45:16,235 --> 00:45:18,703
...and I don't need you giving me attitude.

601
00:45:19,515 --> 00:45:21,312
Don't you all look adorable?

602
00:45:21,395 --> 00:45:24,592
Look, you got a kid,
you got the dog, you got you.

603
00:45:24,795 --> 00:45:27,263
Norman Rockwell, man.
Let me get a picture.

604
00:45:27,395 --> 00:45:28,589
Say "Tupac! "

605
00:45:28,955 --> 00:45:30,183
"Tupac! "

606
00:45:32,755 --> 00:45:35,315
You see that, dog? He said, "Tupac."

607
00:45:38,035 --> 00:45:41,027
I feel like such a proud mama right now.

608
00:45:41,355 --> 00:45:42,629
Look...

609
00:45:43,435 --> 00:45:44,709
...my family.

610
00:45:44,915 --> 00:45:47,224
All right, you want to come to the park?

611
00:45:47,315 --> 00:45:49,067
Park? For what, man?

612
00:45:49,235 --> 00:45:52,113
To watch you watch the dog?
The dog don't move!

613
00:45:52,275 --> 00:45:55,187
He ain't moved since I walked in!
Look at him!

614
00:45:56,155 --> 00:45:57,747
-I think he broke.
-Yeah.

615
00:45:57,835 --> 00:46:00,952
Get Spot's ball, we'll get the Frisbee.
Meet in the hall.

616
00:46:02,875 --> 00:46:04,228
Go get it, Spot!

617
00:46:04,435 --> 00:46:05,550
Go get it.

618
00:46:13,235 --> 00:46:14,748
Maybe the Frisbee will work.

619
00:46:14,835 --> 00:46:16,826
Come on, go get the Frisbee.

620
00:46:17,875 --> 00:46:19,467
What's wrong with you?

621
00:46:28,275 --> 00:46:29,628
You see anything?

622
00:46:30,315 --> 00:46:32,271
Just keep your eyes peeled.

623
00:46:32,475 --> 00:46:34,511
Where does a mutt go?

624
00:46:43,155 --> 00:46:44,190
Take it easy.

625
00:46:44,275 --> 00:46:47,108
He has a bladder condition.
He can't control himself.

626
00:46:47,195 --> 00:46:49,550
I got your bladder condition over here.

627
00:46:49,755 --> 00:46:51,393
Take it easy. Come on.

628
00:46:51,635 --> 00:46:54,103
Get your mutt out of here! Take a hike!

629
00:46:54,595 --> 00:46:56,586
Jeez, it stinks, Gino.

630
00:46:56,755 --> 00:46:58,313
You think it'll stain?

631
00:47:02,755 --> 00:47:04,586
Hey, help!

632
00:47:05,035 --> 00:47:06,866
He stole her purse!

633
00:47:08,155 --> 00:47:09,110
Help!

634
00:47:09,715 --> 00:47:10,830
There he is.

635
00:47:10,995 --> 00:47:13,384
-Spot!
-James, come here!

636
00:47:13,675 --> 00:47:16,269
Spot, come back!

637
00:47:36,155 --> 00:47:38,988
Sorry, man. That dog is totally psycho.

638
00:47:43,635 --> 00:47:45,273
Where's that crazy dog?

639
00:47:45,395 --> 00:47:46,953
There he is.

640
00:47:48,155 --> 00:47:49,986
Spot, no!

641
00:47:50,195 --> 00:47:52,106
Bad dog! What are you doing?

642
00:47:52,315 --> 00:47:55,944
I'm sorry. He's not really my dog.
I didn't know he was a thief!

643
00:47:56,715 --> 00:47:57,670
What?

644
00:48:01,555 --> 00:48:02,829
What's that?

645
00:48:03,035 --> 00:48:04,866
Listen, I said I'm sorry.

646
00:48:05,075 --> 00:48:08,112
Oh, I get it. How much you want? $20?

647
00:48:08,275 --> 00:48:09,674
$25.

648
00:48:09,755 --> 00:48:12,349
Come on, that purse ain't worth
more than that.

649
00:48:12,435 --> 00:48:13,709
I said I'm sorry.

650
00:48:13,795 --> 00:48:16,184
Hey, back off. What's the matter, lady?

651
00:48:30,235 --> 00:48:31,987
Gordon, it's me again.

652
00:48:32,835 --> 00:48:34,871
I can't believe it. This is terrible.

653
00:48:34,955 --> 00:48:37,913
I made it out of the snow,
but all the roads are blocked.

654
00:48:37,995 --> 00:48:42,193
The stupid bus is stuck.
I don't know how I'll get back.

655
00:48:42,915 --> 00:48:45,952
You really don't know
how much I appreciate this.

656
00:48:46,155 --> 00:48:48,350
You're a good man, Gordon.

657
00:48:48,555 --> 00:48:50,352
Hey, Gordon?

658
00:48:50,515 --> 00:48:53,791
You know what? I really hate asking this...

659
00:48:53,995 --> 00:48:58,227
...but the thing is, James has
this little trouble sleeping....

660
00:49:20,635 --> 00:49:22,193
I gotta go.

661
00:49:27,315 --> 00:49:28,543
What's wrong?

662
00:49:29,435 --> 00:49:30,993
I can't take it anymore!

663
00:49:31,075 --> 00:49:34,351
I can't sleep! I can't eat!
I'm an emotional wreck!

664
00:49:34,555 --> 00:49:35,988
It's all right.

665
00:49:36,715 --> 00:49:38,433
You're here now.

666
00:49:39,315 --> 00:49:41,067
Cassavettes...

667
00:49:42,915 --> 00:49:45,383
...l don't know how to tell you this.

668
00:49:46,275 --> 00:49:50,109
-Are you wearing 1 1's dog tag?
-He's feeling what I'm feeling.

669
00:49:50,315 --> 00:49:52,226
I talked to Danvers.

670
00:49:52,435 --> 00:49:55,074
He's only had one cup of kibbles today.

671
00:49:55,275 --> 00:49:58,028
The dog? You came here
to talk about the dog?

672
00:49:58,195 --> 00:50:00,629
Of course! He's my partner! I miss him!

673
00:50:00,755 --> 00:50:02,791
We've never been apart this long.

674
00:50:02,995 --> 00:50:07,352
He's always been a good eater,
just like me, even when he was a puppy.

675
00:50:09,675 --> 00:50:11,313
This is not healthy.

676
00:50:11,475 --> 00:50:13,306
I want you to fly up there...

677
00:50:13,515 --> 00:50:16,473
...check on him,
and get this out of your system.

678
00:50:17,715 --> 00:50:18,864
Really?

679
00:50:19,475 --> 00:50:22,672
There you go.
You do the crime, you do the time.

680
00:50:25,355 --> 00:50:28,586
I told you he wouldn't like that.

681
00:50:29,195 --> 00:50:30,674
Of course he likes that.

682
00:50:30,755 --> 00:50:32,347
That's what that sound means.

683
00:50:32,435 --> 00:50:33,584
Yeah, right.

684
00:50:35,315 --> 00:50:37,112
Come on, it's bedtime.

685
00:50:39,955 --> 00:50:42,025
Just holler if you need anything.

686
00:50:52,075 --> 00:50:53,872
Good night, Spot.

687
00:51:08,435 --> 00:51:10,187
Are you kidding?

688
00:51:14,355 --> 00:51:16,107
Stupid dog!

689
00:51:17,155 --> 00:51:18,793
What's the racket about?

690
00:51:21,875 --> 00:51:23,752
Okay, I get it.

691
00:51:25,715 --> 00:51:27,592
I'm glad you can sleep.

692
00:51:31,315 --> 00:51:33,670
Wait, my keys.

693
00:51:38,555 --> 00:51:39,908
Let's go, stupid.

694
00:51:52,875 --> 00:51:54,354
Come on, go already.

695
00:51:57,395 --> 00:51:58,669
What now?

696
00:52:04,435 --> 00:52:07,108
That's nasty. I'm not picking that up.

697
00:52:28,675 --> 00:52:30,154
What's the big idea?

698
00:52:30,515 --> 00:52:33,552
All right, I'm sorry
I tied you to the furnace.

699
00:52:34,275 --> 00:52:35,549
Let me in.

700
00:52:35,755 --> 00:52:37,746
All right. Where you going?

701
00:52:38,155 --> 00:52:39,304
Come back here!

702
00:52:39,395 --> 00:52:43,388
Where are you going? You stupid dog.

703
00:53:06,355 --> 00:53:09,028
Oh, God. Nasty.

704
00:53:15,235 --> 00:53:16,714
God!

705
00:53:30,795 --> 00:53:32,513
Shut up down there!

706
00:53:32,715 --> 00:53:35,309
I'm covered in caca!

707
00:53:35,475 --> 00:53:36,749
God.

708
00:53:38,635 --> 00:53:40,830
Oh, God.

709
00:54:10,075 --> 00:54:13,067
Spot. I'm gonna kill you.

710
00:54:32,115 --> 00:54:33,070
Come on.

711
00:55:06,075 --> 00:55:07,269
Got some ID?

712
00:55:07,635 --> 00:55:08,750
ID?

713
00:55:08,955 --> 00:55:10,274
I don't think so.

714
00:55:10,355 --> 00:55:12,027
Don't get wise, buddy.

715
00:55:12,235 --> 00:55:15,432
Listen, I live right here.
The dog locked me out.

716
00:55:15,955 --> 00:55:17,104
You been drinking?

717
00:55:17,195 --> 00:55:19,470
No, I have not been drinking!

718
00:55:19,635 --> 00:55:21,944
I'm taking care of the neighbor's kid...

719
00:55:22,035 --> 00:55:23,388
...then this dog came!

720
00:55:23,475 --> 00:55:24,828
Came from where?

721
00:55:24,915 --> 00:55:26,189
Hell.

722
00:55:26,355 --> 00:55:30,985
This is Satan's dog. I'm telling you!
He gets mad at the drop of a hat!

723
00:55:31,155 --> 00:55:34,943
He got pissed off and locked me
out of my own house! He's crazy!

724
00:55:35,235 --> 00:55:38,193
Put your hands on your head!

725
00:55:41,435 --> 00:55:44,268
Okay, let's just try to relax here.

726
00:55:44,475 --> 00:55:46,033
He locked me out of my house.

727
00:55:46,115 --> 00:55:48,470
Satan's dog locked you out?

728
00:55:48,675 --> 00:55:49,869
Yeah.

729
00:55:50,075 --> 00:55:52,111
You think I'd do this to myself?.

730
00:55:53,315 --> 00:55:56,193
Come with us.
We'll get someone who can help you.

731
00:55:56,595 --> 00:55:58,313
Not in my car. He reeks.

732
00:56:00,635 --> 00:56:03,911
Oh, thank God! James!
See, that's the kid!

733
00:56:05,355 --> 00:56:06,788
And that's the dog!

734
00:56:07,115 --> 00:56:08,548
Son, do you know him?

735
00:56:08,635 --> 00:56:11,149
That's Gordon. He lives here.

736
00:56:12,515 --> 00:56:16,110
Next time you step outside, sir,
I suggest you take your keys.

737
00:56:16,275 --> 00:56:18,027
Thanks, I'll remember that.

738
00:56:21,275 --> 00:56:23,550
Let me in the house!

739
00:56:29,795 --> 00:56:32,946
This is crazy, Gino.
Sonny will nail our heads together.

740
00:56:33,155 --> 00:56:36,067
I say we get our passports,
start to learn Spanish.

741
00:56:36,275 --> 00:56:37,788
Arliss...

742
00:56:37,995 --> 00:56:39,713
...you gotta focus.

743
00:56:39,915 --> 00:56:42,349
All we gotta do is get in the dog's head.

744
00:56:42,675 --> 00:56:45,348
So every place a dog has gotta go...

745
00:56:45,435 --> 00:56:46,993
...we hang the posters.

746
00:56:47,075 --> 00:56:49,191
Sooner or later he's gotta show.

747
00:56:49,755 --> 00:56:52,428
And when he does, bada-bing.

748
00:56:52,635 --> 00:56:53,590
That's smart.

749
00:57:04,355 --> 00:57:05,788
What are you doing?

750
00:57:07,035 --> 00:57:09,754
You're doing it all wrong.
Come on, check it out.

751
00:57:09,835 --> 00:57:13,874
You gotta put a bunch of junk on it.
Let me give you some style.

752
00:57:14,315 --> 00:57:15,464
Here you go.

753
00:57:15,795 --> 00:57:18,832
Yeah, that's it. Yeah, get crazy.

754
00:57:19,035 --> 00:57:20,753
Girls love that.

755
00:57:20,915 --> 00:57:22,348
That's the look.

756
00:57:22,515 --> 00:57:23,470
Yeah.

757
00:57:24,115 --> 00:57:26,106
See? That's got attitude.

758
00:57:29,595 --> 00:57:32,063
Gordon, what was your daddy like?

759
00:57:33,075 --> 00:57:34,190
My daddy?

760
00:57:35,235 --> 00:57:37,988
Well, I'm just like you.
I don't have a daddy.

761
00:57:38,195 --> 00:57:39,753
What about your mommy?

762
00:57:39,955 --> 00:57:43,630
-Well, I didn't have a mommy either.
-You didn't have a mommy?

763
00:57:44,635 --> 00:57:46,193
Hey, man, it's cool.

764
00:57:46,395 --> 00:57:47,908
I mean, look at Spot.

765
00:57:48,275 --> 00:57:50,266
Spot doesn't have a mommy or daddy.

766
00:57:50,355 --> 00:57:53,074
He's a stray, but he's happy.

767
00:57:53,275 --> 00:57:56,028
I mean, he's a little screwed up,
but he's happy.

768
00:57:56,755 --> 00:57:59,189
I'm sorry you didn't have
a mommy, Gordon.

769
00:58:00,675 --> 00:58:02,347
I didn't need a mommy.

770
00:58:03,515 --> 00:58:06,666
If I did have one,
she'd probably comb my hair like this.

771
00:58:06,795 --> 00:58:08,592
Make me look foolish.

772
00:58:11,435 --> 00:58:13,073
Mush! Come on!

773
00:58:23,795 --> 00:58:25,865
Tigger, you made it.

774
00:58:26,315 --> 00:58:28,670
It's Tiger, you moron!

775
00:58:28,875 --> 00:58:32,106
You seem awfully happy to be here.

776
00:58:32,995 --> 00:58:35,463
This is not a smile.

777
00:58:35,635 --> 00:58:38,354
My face is frozen like this!

778
00:58:38,515 --> 00:58:39,994
Now, how's Agent 1 1?

779
00:58:44,035 --> 00:58:45,468
That's not Agent 1 1 !

780
00:58:45,675 --> 00:58:47,791
Well, that's the dog they sent us.

781
00:58:50,555 --> 00:58:54,833
-Cassavettes.
-The dog that jumped out was Agent 1 1 .

782
00:58:54,995 --> 00:58:56,906
The tags were switched!

783
00:58:57,115 --> 00:58:58,707
-Are you sure?
-I'm positive.

784
00:58:58,795 --> 00:59:00,751
It had to be Sharp.

785
00:59:07,435 --> 00:59:08,754
Forget it.

786
00:59:09,115 --> 00:59:10,833
She's long gone.

787
00:59:11,475 --> 00:59:14,035
Okay, Spot, let's try it again.

788
00:59:25,435 --> 00:59:27,995
Listen up, Spot. I got no time for you.

789
00:59:28,195 --> 00:59:30,345
And I know you don't like me either.

790
00:59:31,315 --> 00:59:33,783
You're your own dog.
You like to hang back.

791
00:59:33,875 --> 00:59:35,433
I'm down with that.

792
00:59:36,475 --> 00:59:38,625
But I'm here to talk about the kid.

793
00:59:38,835 --> 00:59:41,144
See, his mom keeps him on a short leash.

794
00:59:41,235 --> 00:59:42,907
You hear what I'm saying?

795
00:59:43,035 --> 00:59:45,265
I'd like to see the kid have some fun.

796
00:59:47,315 --> 00:59:50,432
Let's go, Spot. Let's hook
the kid up with some fun.

797
00:59:50,835 --> 00:59:52,905
Let's go! Let's go have some fun!

798
00:59:53,155 --> 00:59:55,146
Come on, let's go have some fun!

799
00:59:58,515 --> 01:00:00,267
I'm sorry, James.

800
01:00:04,675 --> 01:00:06,074
Let's just go.

801
01:00:13,235 --> 01:00:16,068
You should be ashamed of yourself.
Come on.

802
01:00:23,475 --> 01:00:24,828
What's he doing?

803
01:00:25,315 --> 01:00:27,783
I don't know.
Why don't you try throwing it?

804
01:00:33,075 --> 01:00:34,303
How about that?

805
01:00:36,835 --> 01:00:38,871
Good boy, good boy.

806
01:00:40,475 --> 01:00:41,954
Here, come on, Spot.

807
01:00:53,395 --> 01:00:54,748
Come on, jump up.

808
01:00:54,995 --> 01:00:56,508
Come on, Spot. Good boy.

809
01:00:56,595 --> 01:00:59,632
-Did you see how high he jumped?
-Yeah, like five feet.

810
01:00:59,795 --> 01:01:01,148
Our boy can play!

811
01:01:01,515 --> 01:01:05,269
-He isn't retarded.
-No, he's a smart dog.

812
01:01:06,195 --> 01:01:08,072
Thanks, Spot. I owe you one.

813
01:01:08,755 --> 01:01:12,430
What do you say we get him a bone
or a snack or whatever dogs eat?

814
01:01:19,635 --> 01:01:21,068
Get out of here!

815
01:01:23,315 --> 01:01:25,545
-You believe these kids?
-No respect.

816
01:01:30,075 --> 01:01:31,349
That's our mutt!

817
01:01:31,955 --> 01:01:33,707
-That's our mutt!
-Let's go.

818
01:01:37,835 --> 01:01:39,791
All right, you go get the dog...

819
01:01:39,955 --> 01:01:44,233
...one of those.... Whatever he wants.
I'm gonna ask this lady a question.

820
01:01:45,075 --> 01:01:47,191
Hey, how's it going?

821
01:01:49,955 --> 01:01:51,354
Starchild?

822
01:01:52,555 --> 01:01:54,466
"Starchild." Are you serious?

823
01:01:57,795 --> 01:02:00,309
You can have anything you want, Spot.

824
01:02:00,515 --> 01:02:01,994
What about this one?

825
01:02:02,355 --> 01:02:03,470
No.

826
01:02:03,675 --> 01:02:04,710
Hello.

827
01:02:05,275 --> 01:02:06,833
Cat got your tongue?

828
01:02:21,075 --> 01:02:22,906
Now, where did this mutt go?

829
01:02:24,915 --> 01:02:27,713
Hey, kid! Where's that dog?

830
01:02:43,395 --> 01:02:45,909
Be careful. There's piranha in there.

831
01:02:46,155 --> 01:02:47,588
You get the guns.

832
01:02:54,355 --> 01:02:56,266
Let's get that mutt.

833
01:02:58,355 --> 01:03:00,915
No! I'm not paying for this!

834
01:03:22,355 --> 01:03:23,754
Spot, are you okay?

835
01:03:26,795 --> 01:03:28,831
"Can cause paralysis"?

836
01:03:31,715 --> 01:03:33,273
I'll go the other way.

837
01:03:43,475 --> 01:03:45,033
Get this thing off me!

838
01:03:45,155 --> 01:03:46,474
Help!

839
01:04:09,635 --> 01:04:10,954
Hey, kid.

840
01:04:11,155 --> 01:04:12,349
How you doing?

841
01:04:12,915 --> 01:04:15,224
Want to help your Uncle Gino
find the doggy?

842
01:04:15,315 --> 01:04:16,430
Hey!

843
01:04:25,715 --> 01:04:27,592
Whoa. Help!

844
01:04:28,275 --> 01:04:29,390
Help!

845
01:05:07,475 --> 01:05:08,749
You go that way.

846
01:05:08,835 --> 01:05:10,553
That's it. It's over.

847
01:05:13,315 --> 01:05:14,953
My legs!

848
01:05:37,151 --> 01:05:39,870
Gordon? It's me again.

849
01:05:40,071 --> 01:05:41,948
I'm just calling to check in.

850
01:05:42,151 --> 01:05:44,665
Are you there? I'm sure everything's fine.

851
01:05:44,871 --> 01:05:47,305
If you want to, call me on my cell phone.

852
01:05:47,431 --> 01:05:49,501
Okay, I'll talk to you soon. Bye.

853
01:06:02,951 --> 01:06:03,986
Stop!

854
01:06:09,951 --> 01:06:12,101
-So Seattle, huh?
-Yeah.

855
01:06:12,431 --> 01:06:14,387
Don't worry. We have lots of room.

856
01:06:14,471 --> 01:06:17,110
-We'll get you there.
-We'll go straight there?

857
01:06:17,311 --> 01:06:19,222
We're not stopping for nothing.

858
01:06:21,391 --> 01:06:23,302
Well, there you are.

859
01:06:23,711 --> 01:06:26,179
Oh, you're gonna be really comfy in there.

860
01:06:32,631 --> 01:06:35,384
Just don't make any fast movements.

861
01:06:44,151 --> 01:06:45,630
What's that smell?

862
01:06:49,951 --> 01:06:50,940
Hello?

863
01:06:52,671 --> 01:06:53,990
Hi, Mr. Zebra.

864
01:07:09,151 --> 01:07:12,461
-I gotta report an attempted murder.
-Yo, Granger!

865
01:07:13,151 --> 01:07:14,470
You're catching!

866
01:07:16,831 --> 01:07:19,061
This is just perfect.

867
01:07:19,431 --> 01:07:21,626
So where did this happen?

868
01:07:21,831 --> 01:07:24,299
At the pet store. There were two of them.

869
01:07:24,391 --> 01:07:27,110
One was a real big guy,
looking like Pavarotti.

870
01:07:27,311 --> 01:07:29,222
I'm telling you, it was a hit.

871
01:07:29,871 --> 01:07:31,862
A hit? And you were the target?

872
01:07:32,031 --> 01:07:33,589
Dude, not me, the dog.

873
01:07:33,871 --> 01:07:36,021
-The dog?
-Spot was incredible.

874
01:07:36,191 --> 01:07:37,943
He got the bad guys.

875
01:07:38,111 --> 01:07:40,989
It was amazing.
He just took those two guys out.

876
01:07:41,191 --> 01:07:43,830
It's weird, I always thought
he was retarded.

877
01:07:44,511 --> 01:07:46,706
You know what? lf you're asking me...

878
01:07:46,791 --> 01:07:48,588
...you're the one who is retarded.

879
01:07:48,671 --> 01:07:51,231
Dude, he's not retarded. You are.

880
01:07:51,831 --> 01:07:53,059
Yeah? Well....

881
01:07:57,591 --> 01:07:59,309
-Know what I'm thinking?
-What?

882
01:07:59,391 --> 01:08:01,382
When Stephanie returns, I'll tell her...

883
01:08:01,471 --> 01:08:05,589
...not to leave James with a nut who
gets her kid a dog while she's away.

884
01:08:05,791 --> 01:08:07,941
Actually, that's not his dog at all.

885
01:08:08,351 --> 01:08:10,103
That's "Satan's dog."

886
01:08:13,111 --> 01:08:15,545
Let's leave. We don't need these idiots.

887
01:08:16,191 --> 01:08:17,419
Oh, man.

888
01:08:17,631 --> 01:08:18,950
Come on, Spot.

889
01:08:19,511 --> 01:08:21,945
Looks like Agent Sharp
skipped the country.

890
01:08:22,111 --> 01:08:23,544
She did not.

891
01:08:23,711 --> 01:08:26,305
We got ahold of all her credit card records.

892
01:08:26,511 --> 01:08:28,820
She bought a one-way ticket to Belize.

893
01:08:29,031 --> 01:08:30,510
She never made the airport.

894
01:08:30,591 --> 01:08:33,708
And let me tell you something,
if you don't get that dog...

895
01:08:33,791 --> 01:08:37,750
...you're gonna make the airport.
But as part of a runway!

896
01:08:38,591 --> 01:08:42,266
We're dead. We are so dead.

897
01:08:42,831 --> 01:08:45,061
You know, I never saw Godfather Ill.

898
01:08:45,271 --> 01:08:47,626
I heard it wasn't as good as the first two.

899
01:08:47,711 --> 01:08:50,066
I thought we had more time, Gino.

900
01:08:50,311 --> 01:08:52,666
Listen to me.

901
01:08:52,871 --> 01:08:55,146
Take a rest. We're gonna find the dog.

902
01:08:55,231 --> 01:08:59,019
Hey, Gino, I didn't think
they let you out of Jersey.

903
01:08:59,231 --> 01:09:01,984
-What are you doing here?
-What do you say, Tommy?

904
01:09:02,071 --> 01:09:04,426
I just got a little business to finish up.

905
01:09:04,511 --> 01:09:06,900
That's good. Great.

906
01:09:08,231 --> 01:09:11,985
I can't stand that clown.
He's got no respect.

907
01:09:14,471 --> 01:09:16,826
-Hello.
-Yeah, I know who's got your dog.

908
01:09:17,271 --> 01:09:20,343
My neighbor. The guy's a freak.

909
01:09:20,511 --> 01:09:22,422
They got the dog. We got the dog.

910
01:09:22,631 --> 01:09:24,508
The bureau appreciates your help.

911
01:09:24,591 --> 01:09:27,708
A canine agent disappeared
in this area a few days ago.

912
01:09:27,911 --> 01:09:30,186
We are intent on finding that dog.

913
01:09:30,391 --> 01:09:33,110
What is it with the dogs all of a sudden?

914
01:09:33,311 --> 01:09:37,463
I had this idiot in who said the Mafia
put a contract out on his dog.

915
01:09:37,671 --> 01:09:38,990
That's Agent 1 1 .

916
01:09:39,391 --> 01:09:40,824
Yeah, and?

917
01:09:41,151 --> 01:09:45,429
He's my partner, you greasy-haired reptile.
Tell me everything.

918
01:09:50,791 --> 01:09:52,190
I can't sleep.

919
01:09:54,151 --> 01:09:56,745
-Why not, buddy?
-I had a bad dream.

920
01:09:56,951 --> 01:09:58,145
About what?

921
01:09:58,911 --> 01:10:02,699
Charizard was trying to burn me,
and I had to run away.

922
01:10:02,911 --> 01:10:04,822
-Who's Charizard?
-A Pokmon.

923
01:10:05,031 --> 01:10:06,862
I thought Pikachu was the Pokmon.

924
01:10:06,951 --> 01:10:08,862
There's all different Pokmon.

925
01:10:09,271 --> 01:10:12,627
-And they all have different powers?
-You catch on fast.

926
01:10:14,031 --> 01:10:17,501
And are they named
after what they sort of do?

927
01:10:17,831 --> 01:10:18,786
Kind of.

928
01:10:19,551 --> 01:10:23,942
Okay, so if you were a Pokmon,
you'd be Snotty-nose-achu.

929
01:10:24,151 --> 01:10:27,700
You would be Stinky-feet-achu.

930
01:10:31,391 --> 01:10:33,427
And you'd be Fart-in-bed-achu.

931
01:10:33,951 --> 01:10:35,270
It wasn't me.

932
01:10:35,471 --> 01:10:36,984
It wasn't me, either.

933
01:10:37,311 --> 01:10:39,950
Wait, if it wasn't me, and it wasn't you....

934
01:10:45,231 --> 01:10:46,664
Do you like my mom?

935
01:10:48,071 --> 01:10:50,426
Yeah. I really do.

936
01:10:50,591 --> 01:10:52,070
Why don't you marry her?

937
01:10:52,151 --> 01:10:55,541
Well, because, you know,
marriage is a big step.

938
01:10:55,711 --> 01:10:59,181
You really gotta know someone
before you do something like that.

939
01:10:59,431 --> 01:11:01,183
You'd be fun for a dad.

940
01:11:02,591 --> 01:11:03,785
You think so?

941
01:11:04,911 --> 01:11:05,821
Thanks.

942
01:11:08,831 --> 01:11:09,820
Hold it.

943
01:11:10,031 --> 01:11:11,862
I think this is the block.

944
01:11:12,071 --> 01:11:13,629
Yeah, let's go.

945
01:11:13,831 --> 01:11:15,822
And they lived happily ever after...

946
01:11:15,911 --> 01:11:18,869
...because they won the lottery
and moved to Hawaii.

947
01:11:25,631 --> 01:11:26,984
There you go.

948
01:11:57,431 --> 01:11:59,501
Don't hog all the blankets.

949
01:12:00,791 --> 01:12:03,180
I am so glad this is off our plate.

950
01:12:03,391 --> 01:12:06,861
Yeah, you look like you could use
something off your plate.

951
01:12:19,711 --> 01:12:21,781
Have you seen any of these men?

952
01:12:23,391 --> 01:12:26,030
Yeah. These two.
They destroyed the pet store.

953
01:12:27,271 --> 01:12:31,708
If there's any cost for the damages,
they should be held responsible.

954
01:12:31,871 --> 01:12:35,386
You're very lucky, Mr. Smith.
These men are extremely dangerous.

955
01:12:35,551 --> 01:12:39,146
You should be all right now that
Agent 1 1 is with us. 1 1, let's go!

956
01:12:39,231 --> 01:12:40,459
What?

957
01:12:40,991 --> 01:12:43,744
-No.
-Spot's leaving?

958
01:12:45,511 --> 01:12:48,503
I promised the dog to the kid.
You can't take the dog.

959
01:12:48,631 --> 01:12:50,781
Don't take the dog. Look at the kid.

960
01:12:50,871 --> 01:12:55,023
-You can't take him.
-Agent 1 1 is U.S. Government property.

961
01:12:55,231 --> 01:12:56,823
But you can't take him.

962
01:13:03,071 --> 01:13:04,663
Come on, James.

963
01:13:05,511 --> 01:13:07,263
Spot doesn't belong to us.

964
01:13:07,471 --> 01:13:09,939
I think he has to go back with these guys.

965
01:13:12,391 --> 01:13:14,063
Here we go, boy.

966
01:13:15,231 --> 01:13:17,347
He doesn't like that.

967
01:13:18,831 --> 01:13:19,866
Come on.

968
01:13:22,671 --> 01:13:24,548
Don't go, Spot.

969
01:13:30,871 --> 01:13:32,020
No!

970
01:14:03,711 --> 01:14:08,023
-You're gonna have to eat something.
-I'm not eating till Spot comes back.

971
01:14:08,631 --> 01:14:10,508
Well, Spot's not coming back.

972
01:14:10,751 --> 01:14:12,662
That's life. Get used to it.

973
01:14:21,871 --> 01:14:23,145
Let's see.

974
01:14:23,991 --> 01:14:25,583
You lost the dog.

975
01:14:25,791 --> 01:14:27,349
The boy wants you dead.

976
01:14:27,431 --> 01:14:29,865
No way you're getting jiggy
with his mama.

977
01:14:29,951 --> 01:14:33,546
That makes you a single man again,
brother. Give it to me up top.

978
01:14:34,751 --> 01:14:36,946
Okay, leave me hanging. Okay, cool.

979
01:14:37,151 --> 01:14:38,584
I'll remember that.

980
01:14:49,151 --> 01:14:50,584
I need you to eat.

981
01:14:51,391 --> 01:14:52,346
1 1, eat.

982
01:14:56,031 --> 01:14:58,499
You're gonna be stupid
and not do anything?

983
01:14:58,631 --> 01:15:00,826
I am doing something. I'm moving on.

984
01:15:00,991 --> 01:15:04,301
You should, too. Listen, James,
don't get attached to things.

985
01:15:04,391 --> 01:15:07,349
-It only ends up messing with you.
-But he's our dog.

986
01:15:07,471 --> 01:15:10,702
No, he's a government official,
much like myself.

987
01:15:10,911 --> 01:15:13,106
No, he's our dog and he loves us.

988
01:15:13,631 --> 01:15:15,349
Know what? You're just a kid.

989
01:15:15,431 --> 01:15:17,422
You know nothing. You're irrational!

990
01:15:17,511 --> 01:15:19,467
No, you're stupid!

991
01:15:27,831 --> 01:15:31,062
-Hello!
-Gordon, hi.

992
01:15:31,231 --> 01:15:32,664
Oh, it's you.

993
01:15:32,871 --> 01:15:36,659
You won't believe what I've been through,
but I'm really close now.

994
01:15:36,831 --> 01:15:39,391
Every time you call,
you got some lame excuse.

995
01:15:39,471 --> 01:15:41,939
What's it this time?
Dog ate your homework?

996
01:15:42,151 --> 01:15:44,506
Are you okay? ls everything all right?

997
01:15:44,711 --> 01:15:46,588
And always with the questions.

998
01:15:46,751 --> 01:15:49,504
All I want to know is,
when are you gonna be here?

999
01:15:49,711 --> 01:15:51,030
Gordon, what happened?

1000
01:15:51,111 --> 01:15:53,909
I will not be treated
like an irresponsible idiot.

1001
01:15:54,071 --> 01:15:56,027
You're the irresponsible one.

1002
01:15:56,191 --> 01:15:57,260
It's your fault!

1003
01:15:57,351 --> 01:15:59,546
I shouldn't be watching a dog...

1004
01:15:59,711 --> 01:16:02,305
...and I sure don't need some kid in my life.

1005
01:16:07,191 --> 01:16:08,146
Stop!

1006
01:16:08,351 --> 01:16:10,581
You're taking me to my kid, now!

1007
01:16:52,951 --> 01:16:54,907
Agent 1 1 ! He's escaped.

1008
01:16:55,711 --> 01:16:56,826
Agent 1 1 !

1009
01:17:09,071 --> 01:17:11,141
All right, truce. Come out here.

1010
01:17:20,431 --> 01:17:22,103
Come on, this isn't funny.

1011
01:17:28,671 --> 01:17:30,741
My kid. I lost my kid.

1012
01:17:37,431 --> 01:17:39,103
Keep your mouth shut.

1013
01:17:43,351 --> 01:17:44,670
This is suicide.

1014
01:17:44,791 --> 01:17:47,510
How in the hell could you guys
let Agent 1 1 escape?

1015
01:17:47,591 --> 01:17:49,502
You'll all be reprimanded.

1016
01:17:50,871 --> 01:17:52,190
Where you going?

1017
01:17:52,551 --> 01:17:55,384
To find my dog,
and I know exactly where he went.

1018
01:17:55,871 --> 01:17:57,589
Back to those two.

1019
01:18:08,071 --> 01:18:11,268
I thought you were dead. Get in the truck.

1020
01:18:13,231 --> 01:18:16,507
-Come on, buddy, get in the truck.
-I'm gonna find Spot.

1021
01:18:18,111 --> 01:18:20,989
How you gonna find him?
Think you're a detective?

1022
01:18:33,791 --> 01:18:35,349
Why did you run away?

1023
01:18:36,111 --> 01:18:38,830
What do you care? You don't want me.

1024
01:18:40,031 --> 01:18:41,225
What?

1025
01:18:42,591 --> 01:18:44,547
No, I didn't mean it like that.

1026
01:18:44,871 --> 01:18:46,941
Why did you say that to my mom?

1027
01:18:48,831 --> 01:18:51,743
You know, I was just scared.

1028
01:18:53,151 --> 01:18:55,984
And sometimes, when people get upset...

1029
01:18:56,191 --> 01:18:58,102
...it comes out all messed up.

1030
01:18:59,591 --> 01:19:00,944
Do you miss Spot?

1031
01:19:03,191 --> 01:19:04,783
Yeah, I guess I do.

1032
01:19:05,831 --> 01:19:08,345
I'm really glad you ended up
staying with me.

1033
01:19:08,511 --> 01:19:10,308
Glad we became pals.

1034
01:19:11,751 --> 01:19:15,027
I didn't mean what I said to your ma.
Not even a little bit.

1035
01:19:16,791 --> 01:19:18,543
Think you could forgive me?

1036
01:19:25,111 --> 01:19:28,023
It's okay, Gordon. I'm glad we're friends.

1037
01:19:30,751 --> 01:19:31,706
Me too.

1038
01:19:36,191 --> 01:19:38,307
There they are. Back it up.

1039
01:19:38,871 --> 01:19:40,987
It's those guys. Come on!

1040
01:19:41,751 --> 01:19:43,423
Get back there! Hold on!

1041
01:19:53,471 --> 01:19:55,109
-James, you okay?
-Yeah.

1042
01:19:56,631 --> 01:19:59,668
-Throw those boxes at them.
-All right!

1043
01:20:02,911 --> 01:20:05,903
Dive bomb! Depth charge!

1044
01:20:06,111 --> 01:20:07,863
-Watch it!
-I got it.

1045
01:20:12,991 --> 01:20:15,061
This mailman's gonna lose his job.

1046
01:20:15,871 --> 01:20:17,190
Where'd they go?

1047
01:20:23,871 --> 01:20:25,384
James, are you okay?

1048
01:20:25,591 --> 01:20:27,104
Look what I found.

1049
01:20:27,311 --> 01:20:29,188
Good idea. Come on.

1050
01:20:29,391 --> 01:20:30,744
Police!

1051
01:20:33,791 --> 01:20:34,780
Police!

1052
01:20:34,991 --> 01:20:37,141
Help! 91 1 !

1053
01:20:37,511 --> 01:20:38,546
Help!

1054
01:20:42,111 --> 01:20:44,227
That's gotta hurt.

1055
01:20:50,111 --> 01:20:51,146
Hurry, James!

1056
01:20:51,231 --> 01:20:54,223
-Hey, get over here!
-Give me the dog!

1057
01:20:54,431 --> 01:20:56,422
Where's the dog? Get over here.

1058
01:21:07,831 --> 01:21:11,187
Help me! Come on!

1059
01:21:22,311 --> 01:21:23,710
Come on, get off.

1060
01:21:30,471 --> 01:21:31,426
Help.

1061
01:21:34,991 --> 01:21:36,060
Run!

1062
01:21:49,311 --> 01:21:52,223
I'll save you from calling the cops.
We got one here.

1063
01:21:52,431 --> 01:21:53,910
Sit down over there.

1064
01:21:53,991 --> 01:21:55,549
And you, shut up.

1065
01:21:57,431 --> 01:21:58,659
Where is that mutt?

1066
01:21:58,751 --> 01:22:00,628
I thought he was with the FBl.

1067
01:22:00,711 --> 01:22:03,544
He escaped to be with you.

1068
01:22:04,871 --> 01:22:07,431
How touching. I'm all choked up.

1069
01:22:07,631 --> 01:22:10,907
Could you loan me a handkerchief
while we wait for the mutt?

1070
01:22:17,471 --> 01:22:18,790
Somebody help me here.

1071
01:22:18,871 --> 01:22:20,668
Get off of me!

1072
01:22:24,591 --> 01:22:25,944
Come here, you.

1073
01:22:27,071 --> 01:22:28,345
That's it.

1074
01:22:28,831 --> 01:22:30,867
Mr. Talia, what are you doing here?

1075
01:22:30,951 --> 01:22:34,546
I took a wild guess and figured
you two baboons would screw it up.

1076
01:22:34,631 --> 01:22:37,270
-Sit down, the both of youse.
-Sonny, the dog--

1077
01:22:37,351 --> 01:22:39,546
-It wasn't our fault.
-No?

1078
01:22:39,711 --> 01:22:42,862
I don't know if it's worth
the bullets for the two of you.

1079
01:22:43,071 --> 01:22:45,266
I gotta ask my accountant. Afterwards.

1080
01:22:45,351 --> 01:22:49,742
Excuse me, Mr. Mob Boss Guy, I wouldn't
make any sudden moves if I were you.

1081
01:22:49,951 --> 01:22:51,782
You wouldn't, you punk? Why not?

1082
01:22:51,871 --> 01:22:55,227
-I don't think Spot would like that.
-And who is Spot?

1083
01:23:00,311 --> 01:23:01,539
Spot!

1084
01:23:07,111 --> 01:23:08,180
Come on.

1085
01:23:08,831 --> 01:23:10,025
Come on.

1086
01:23:18,271 --> 01:23:19,420
1 1, the gun!

1087
01:23:21,191 --> 01:23:22,943
You take it.

1088
01:23:44,831 --> 01:23:46,423
-Spot!
-1 1 !

1089
01:23:46,831 --> 01:23:48,150
Kick him, James!

1090
01:23:49,111 --> 01:23:51,341
Run, James! Run!

1091
01:23:56,311 --> 01:23:59,064
No, not again! Come on!

1092
01:23:59,271 --> 01:24:02,104
No, not again.

1093
01:24:07,711 --> 01:24:10,145
-Hey, Spot.
-You're the greatest, Spot.

1094
01:24:10,751 --> 01:24:12,742
Hey, what do you got there, boy?

1095
01:24:20,711 --> 01:24:22,144
All right, get up!

1096
01:24:23,631 --> 01:24:25,383
Scratchy, scratchy, good dog!

1097
01:24:25,471 --> 01:24:27,621
Good boy. I love you.

1098
01:24:28,191 --> 01:24:29,590
Agent 1 1 ...

1099
01:24:30,391 --> 01:24:31,506
...come on.

1100
01:24:31,871 --> 01:24:34,180
His name's Spot. He's staying with us.

1101
01:24:35,591 --> 01:24:39,061
Open up your eyes, man.
This dog's got a lot going on inside.

1102
01:24:40,231 --> 01:24:42,699
He just wants to be a dog, with a family.

1103
01:24:42,911 --> 01:24:46,142
He's never had a family before,
and it's been really rough.

1104
01:24:46,911 --> 01:24:48,264
The FBI is his family.

1105
01:24:48,351 --> 01:24:50,546
The FBI is not a family. It's a job.

1106
01:24:50,631 --> 01:24:53,225
Come on. He's got a chance
to be happy now...

1107
01:24:53,991 --> 01:24:56,107
...with people that care about him.

1108
01:24:56,231 --> 01:24:59,701
I want to give him a home.
I won't let you mess that up.

1109
01:25:00,511 --> 01:25:03,309
I think it's time that Spot
decides what he wants.

1110
01:25:04,511 --> 01:25:06,388
I can't ask him. He's a dog.

1111
01:25:06,911 --> 01:25:09,300
Let's just see. Let's see what he wants.

1112
01:25:33,511 --> 01:25:34,705
Good boy, Spot.

1113
01:25:52,351 --> 01:25:53,466
What is it?

1114
01:25:54,871 --> 01:25:56,429
What do you want, boy?

1115
01:25:57,991 --> 01:25:59,310
What is it, boy?

1116
01:26:01,471 --> 01:26:02,904
I'll miss you, too.

1117
01:26:11,711 --> 01:26:13,144
Thanks for the ride.

1118
01:26:13,391 --> 01:26:15,507
Benny! What happened?

1119
01:26:15,711 --> 01:26:17,542
I don't believe anybody's dead.

1120
01:26:17,631 --> 01:26:20,862
Gordon and James took down
a mob boss and his henchmen--

1121
01:26:22,631 --> 01:26:24,462
Gordon gonna need some help.

1122
01:26:25,431 --> 01:26:27,103
We need a SWAT team, man.

1123
01:26:28,271 --> 01:26:30,990
Then you hit the guy in the head
with the meatballs?

1124
01:26:31,071 --> 01:26:32,299
That was funny.

1125
01:26:33,591 --> 01:26:34,910
Mom!

1126
01:26:35,551 --> 01:26:36,870
What's going on?

1127
01:26:40,151 --> 01:26:41,300
Oh, my God!

1128
01:26:41,631 --> 01:26:44,987
-Stephanie. You look great.
-We had the greatest time!

1129
01:26:45,151 --> 01:26:50,066
Gordon had me under his arm and then
two bad guys with guns chased us.

1130
01:26:50,271 --> 01:26:54,344
There were dogs everywhere,
and this is Spot, the dog Gordon gave me.

1131
01:26:57,311 --> 01:27:01,304
You look like you had a hard trip.
Maybe we should talk about this later.

1132
01:27:01,471 --> 01:27:05,464
If you ever come within 50 feet of my son,
I'll call the police.

1133
01:27:05,671 --> 01:27:08,583
Well, Stephanie, I live 25 feet away.

1134
01:27:08,791 --> 01:27:10,827
Those came in very handy.

1135
01:27:12,511 --> 01:27:14,103
I can explain.

1136
01:27:21,311 --> 01:27:22,380
Come on.

1137
01:27:32,631 --> 01:27:34,508
Hey there, music man.

1138
01:27:39,831 --> 01:27:43,870
I'm gonna catch you in the yard.
We're gonna settle this, man to man.

1139
01:27:52,991 --> 01:27:54,868
-What's up, G?
-Yo, what's up?

1140
01:27:54,951 --> 01:27:57,306
I'm all right. You know what, man?

1141
01:27:57,831 --> 01:28:00,982
-He's not such a bad dog after all.
-No, he's a good dog.

1142
01:28:06,551 --> 01:28:08,781
You really dug Stephanie, didn't you?

1143
01:28:10,911 --> 01:28:13,630
Now she just sees you
as unreliable, immature...

1144
01:28:13,951 --> 01:28:17,944
...irresponsible, fly-by-night,
bad kid-watching dude.

1145
01:28:20,671 --> 01:28:22,024
You want a hug, man?

1146
01:28:22,111 --> 01:28:26,263
No, I'd rather not. I'll just take the dog
to the park or something.

1147
01:28:26,711 --> 01:28:28,827
-But thanks, man.
-Go on and walk your dog.

1148
01:28:28,911 --> 01:28:30,867
All right. See you later.

1149
01:28:33,391 --> 01:28:35,586
Do you like it? There you go. Thanks.

1150
01:28:35,671 --> 01:28:36,945
Hey!

1151
01:28:38,591 --> 01:28:39,990
I'm sorry.

1152
01:28:43,391 --> 01:28:44,824
What? What's this?

1153
01:28:50,671 --> 01:28:53,549
What's up, buddy? Trying to jump me?

1154
01:28:58,751 --> 01:29:01,140
You two turning to a life of crime now?

1155
01:29:02,231 --> 01:29:03,869
-Here.
-Thanks.

1156
01:29:04,591 --> 01:29:05,944
So, you're a hero now.

1157
01:29:06,031 --> 01:29:09,307
James tells me you and Spot
saved him from the bad guys.

1158
01:29:09,471 --> 01:29:13,146
I actually thought he was exaggerating
because he likes you so much.

1159
01:29:14,071 --> 01:29:18,906
-It's really true. He's an FBI agent.
-I actually checked it out.

1160
01:29:21,711 --> 01:29:25,306
It sounds like you saved James' life, too.
Thank you.

1161
01:29:30,111 --> 01:29:31,829
Listen, l...

1162
01:29:32,831 --> 01:29:37,302
...l think maybe I might have jumped
to conclusions about you...

1163
01:29:37,471 --> 01:29:40,463
...and I wonder if you'd
like to give it another shot.

1164
01:29:40,911 --> 01:29:43,141
"It"? You mean us?

1165
01:29:43,871 --> 01:29:45,065
The two of us.

1166
01:29:50,391 --> 01:29:52,700
If you make it the three of us, I'm in.

1167
01:29:57,551 --> 01:30:00,190
Okay! The four of us. Sorry.

1168
01:30:00,631 --> 01:30:01,746
Come on.

1169
01:30:02,591 --> 01:30:05,310
-Go get your ball, Spot!
-Go get it! Go on!
