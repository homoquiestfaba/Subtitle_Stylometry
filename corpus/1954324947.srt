Didn't even have time to rinse.

145
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:13,123
It's a ballooning-out
of an artery wall in the brain.

146
00:10:13,213 --> 00:10:16,558
- And when it pops?
- That would be a hemorrhagic stroke.

And I'm dead.

148
00:10:18,318 --> 00:10:20,958
The seriousness depends on the size
and location of the aneurysm.

00:11:23,082 --> 00:11:26,529
Poor little princess. Poor, poor you.
Well, excuse me for dying!

172
00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:28,895
Sir, I need you to stay calm.
It's bad for your blood pressure.

173
00:11:28,988 --> 00:11:30,661
- Please sit back down.
- How long do I have?

174
00:11:30,723 --> 00:11:32,703
- I don't know.
- Yeah, you do.

175
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:35,296
- No, I don't.
- It's all over your face like a pinched lemon!

176
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:37,864
The Lemon Princess.
You think you can hurt my feelings?

177
00:11:37,931 --> 00:11:41,674
You don't care, remember?
This is just a job! You don't feel this!

178
00:11:41,734 --> 00:11:43,873
Probably takes a diamond commercial
or a sick cat...

179
00:11:43,937 --> 00:11:45,780
to get some feelings out of you!

180
00:11:47,106 --> 00:11:49,552
Oh. Sick cats,
is that what makes you tick?

181
00:11:49,642 --> 00:11:52,020
That's what makes
the Lemon Princess get all wah-wah?

182
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:54,388
Here I am, your sick and dying pet.

183
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,892
Tell your fucking pet how long he has!

184
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:58,327
- I don't know.
- How long?

185
00:11:58,384 --> 00:11:59,727
- I don't know!
- How long?

186
00:11:59,786 --> 00:12:01,663
- Oh. I can't breathe.
- Give me a number.

187
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:03,598
A number.
Give me a number!

188
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:05,670
A number, a number, a number, a number.

189
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:08,535
I'm not leaving here
till I get a goddamn number!

190
00:12:08,595 --> 00:12:09,938
- Ninety!
- Ninety what?

191
00:12:10,029 --> 00:12:12,066
Minutes!

192
00:12:12,131 --> 00:12:15,078
- That's your professional opinion?
- Yeah.

193
00:12:15,134 --> 00:12:16,977
Well, fuck you!

194
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:18,515
You asked.

195
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:20,414
Ninety!

196
00:12:20,506 --> 00:12:23,043
Hey, see this watch? See it?

197
00:12:23,109 --> 00:12:25,589
It belonged to my father.
He lived to 90!

198
00:12:25,678 --> 00:12:27,157
Ninety years!

199
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:29,249
You wanna know what happens
in 90 minutes?

200
00:12:29,349 --> 00:12:34,230
That's 6:22! 6:22 p.m.
I'm gonna be alive!

201
00:12:34,287 --> 00:12:36,733
I'm gonna be having a beer!
And I'm gonna be smiling!

202
00:12:36,789 --> 00:12:40,100
I'm gonna be smiling
because you will have been fired.

203
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:42,537
That's right,
I'm calling the C.E.O. of this HMO...

204
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:44,973
and getting your potty little ass canned!

205
00:12:45,965 --> 00:12:47,569
Dead prick!

206
00:12:47,634 --> 00:12:49,409
Doctor cunt!

207
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:21,210
Oh, fuck me!

208
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:22,473
Taxi!

209
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:25,440
Yo, taxi!

210
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:33,317
Downtown Brooklyn.

211
00:13:33,413 --> 00:13:37,156
<i>F Henry Narrating j
Even though Henry knew 90 minutes was illogical...</i>

212
00:13:37,216 --> 00:13:40,220
<i>the more he thought
about her prognosis, her curse...</i>

213
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,857
<i>the more I! took on weight.</i>

214
00:13:42,955 --> 00:13:46,164
<i>What if? What if?</i>

215
00:13:46,225 --> 00:13:49,206
<i>He seemed to remember that
there were four or five stages to death.</i>

216
00:13:49,295 --> 00:13:51,138
What are you doing?
Drive on the sidewalk!

217
00:13:51,197 --> 00:13:53,006
I don't wanna die behind a cement truck!

218
00:13:53,066 --> 00:13:56,013
<i>F Henry Narrating J
Anger was certainly one of them. Check that.</i>

219
00:13:56,069 --> 00:14:00,609
<i>Was not deniai another?
What was he denying, the 90 minutes?</i>

220
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:05,179
<i>What if he, Henry Altmann,
really was going to die at 6:22?</i>

221
00:14:05,244 --> 00:14:07,918
What the holy fuck should I be doing?

222
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:13,196
Tell Mr. Altmann ifs very important.

223
00:14:13,252 --> 00:14:16,495
Can you please just have him call me'?
Okay, thank you.

224
00:14:17,824 --> 00:14:19,929
- Is it true?
- What?

225
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:21,699
- Is it true'?
- What true?

226
00:14:21,794 --> 00:14:24,570
Everybody's going around
saying you told some patient...

227
00:14:24,664 --> 00:14:27,076
that he has 90 hours to live.

228
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:28,474
No!

229
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:30,377
I didn't think so, 'cause that's crazy.

230
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:31,574
That's-

231
00:14:32,638 --> 00:14:33,582
What?

232
00:14:33,673 --> 00:14:35,550
Nothing.

233
00:14:35,641 --> 00:14:37,552
- You did!
- No, I didn't!

234
00:14:37,643 --> 00:14:38,747
- I knew it!
- I didn't.

235
00:14:38,845 --> 00:14:41,223
- Everybody's saying you did!
- Jordan, be quiet!

236
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,692
- Told a guy he had 90-
- Would you get in the room?

237
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:57,571
I know! I know! He just kept yelling...

238
00:14:57,663 --> 00:14:59,665
“Give me a number!
Give me a number! A number.”

239
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:02,736
And I couldn't breathe,
and I panicked and I totally lost it.

240
00:15:02,835 --> 00:15:04,075
Apparently.

241
00:15:04,137 --> 00:15:06,083
God, I- Ooh, I hated him.

242
00:15:06,139 --> 00:15:09,586
Well, that one I can't fault you on.
We all hate our patients.

243
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:13,216
What's wrong with the guy anyway'?

244
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:14,781
Cerebral aneurysm.

245
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:18,752
And you let him walk out of here?

246
00:15:18,851 --> 00:15:21,263
- That wasn't the plan!
- Christ!

247
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,561
I was trying to send him to Bernstein, okay?

248
00:15:23,623 --> 00:15:25,296
Seriously, Christ, Sharon.

249
00:15:25,391 --> 00:15:27,928
I know, I know.
I'm horrible. I'm a horrible person.

250
00:15:27,994 --> 00:15:30,065
I have been trying to get a hold of him.

251
00:15:30,129 --> 00:15:32,700
I've called his cell, his home, his work,
and he just won't pick up.

252
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:34,608
Why are you looking at me so funny'?

253
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:37,078
What's up with your eyes right now?
Are you high?

254
00:15:37,136 --> 00:15:40,174
Not now. I'm serious.

255
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:41,946
- For real'?
- Yeah, for real!

256
00:15:42,008 --> 00:15:44,147
Sharon, this is bad.
There's gonna be consequences.

257
00:15:44,243 --> 00:15:46,951
You could get suspended.
You could lose your license.

258
00:15:47,013 --> 00:15:48,890
He wasn't even my patient!

259
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:51,451
He was Fielding's!
I was just covering for him!

260
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:53,827
“Oh, I wanna spend the weekend
with my family.

261
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,922
I have kids. I have a life."

262
00:15:55,988 --> 00:15:58,298
Stupid, back-stabbing motherfucker!

263
00:15:58,357 --> 00:16:01,270
- I warned you.
- No, you didn't.

264
00:16:01,327 --> 00:16:03,136
Yes, I did.

265
00:16:03,196 --> 00:16:04,971
He said he was gonna get a divorce, okay'?

266
00:16:05,031 --> 00:16:06,908
He said that he loved me. He-

267
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,809
Human emotion, I find it very off-putting.

268
00:16:08,901 --> 00:16:12,371
Let's focus on the logic.
Like the patient. What's the guy's name?

269
00:16:13,372 --> 00:16:15,978
Altmann. Henry Altmann.

270
00:16:16,042 --> 00:16:17,612
Okay, Henry Altmann.
That's a great name.

271
00:16:17,677 --> 00:16:21,147
That sounds like a very wholesome,
nice family man's name.

272
00:16:21,214 --> 00:16:23,319
I'm sure this is not the type of guy
who's gonna freak out...

273
00:16:23,382 --> 00:16:27,387
file complaints, just go totally nuts on you,
trying to ruin your career.

274
00:16:28,588 --> 00:16:30,329
Ohh.

275
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:32,835
Okay, I'm getting the impression
maybe he is that type of guy.

276
00:16:32,925 --> 00:16:36,338
This is bad.
This is miscommunication, is what this is.

277
00:16:36,395 --> 00:16:39,467
I need to get him admitted
to a hospital today, for his own good...

278
00:16:39,532 --> 00:16:41,375
and then he's somebody else's problem.

279
00:16:41,467 --> 00:16:44,676
Then he's Bernstein's problem. Right?

280
00:16:45,771 --> 00:16:47,341
Can't hurt.

281
00:16:48,407 --> 00:16:50,250
I have to find Henry Altmann.

282
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:10,102
A Dr. Gill has been calling for you.

283
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:12,176
- Where's Aaron?
- She said it was extremely important.

284
00:17:12,231 --> 00:17:13,335
Where's Aaron?

285
00:17:13,399 --> 00:17:14,878
In the meeting.

286
00:17:16,235 --> 00:17:18,977
148 and 65 Charles Street.

287
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:23,453
There is a six-month advance on the one
and a six-month delinquency on the other.

288
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:25,216
My long-lost brother.

289
00:17:25,278 --> 00:17:27,656
What if you pick up
the pending violations on 148?

290
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:29,215
- Garbage.
- And boiler.

291
00:17:29,282 --> 00:17:31,387
- I have a question.
- About the boiler'?

292
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:33,930
No, I need some advice.

293
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:38,400
A client, he just found out
he has 90 minutes to live.

294
00:17:38,457 --> 00:17:41,404
- What should I tell him to do'?
- Henry, we really need to get back to this now.

295
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:42,996
- I know what I would do.
- What'?

296
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:44,132
Cry.

297
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:45,732
For the first 20 minutes.

298
00:17:45,831 --> 00:17:48,903
Then I'd go to that Thai massage place
on York and get a blowjob.

299
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:52,073
I'd go to Temple Israel, pray a little,
make a nice big donation.

300
00:17:52,138 --> 00:17:53,674
Can we get back to this now?

301
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:56,583
- Me, I think I'd kill someone.
- Why?

302
00:17:56,676 --> 00:17:59,418
For the social good.
Some deeply evil schmuck.

303
00:17:59,478 --> 00:18:02,755
- Like who?
- We live in Brooklyn. How hard could ii be?

304
00:18:02,848 --> 00:18:04,418
I got a joke. Hang on a second.

305
00:18:04,483 --> 00:18:09,125
Man goes to see a doctor,
and he's told that he only has 10 hours to live.

306
00:18:09,221 --> 00:18:11,223
It's a terrible shock.
What's he gonna do?

307
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:13,930
So he picks up the phone
and he calls his wife, and he says...

308
00:18:14,026 --> 00:18:18,338
“Honey, I'm gonna take you to the Four Seasons,
the best restaurant in town...

309
00:18:18,431 --> 00:18:21,139
and we're gonna eat everything
on the menu.

310
00:18:21,233 --> 00:18:23,474
And then, we're gonna go
to the Rainbow Room...

311
00:18:23,569 --> 00:18:26,448
where we're gonna dance all hours,
like we were young again.

312
00:18:26,505 --> 00:18:31,250
And then, finally, home,
where we will make mad, passionate love...

313
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:35,122
till all hours of the night,
until, at last, at dawn...

314
00:18:35,181 --> 00:18:37,127
I will die in your loving arms.

315
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:38,890
What do you think of that?"

316
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:40,760
And the wife says, “Easy for you.

317
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:43,096
You don't have to get up in the morning."

318
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:49,935
- Henry.
- What?

319
00:18:49,996 --> 00:18:55,070
Tell your client to go home,
make love to his wife one last time and be happy.

320
00:18:56,435 --> 00:18:58,642
In the end...

321
00:18:58,738 --> 00:19:00,615
all we have is family.

322
00:19:04,176 --> 00:19:05,314
Family?

323
00:19:05,378 --> 00:19:07,085
You're right.

324
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,753
Family. Thanks.

325
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:14,632
You're not gonna be billing us
for this crap, are you?

326
00:19:18,524 --> 00:19:21,334
Hey, hey, Henry, wait up!

327
00:19:21,394 --> 00:19:23,340
- Where you going?
- Home.

328
00:19:23,396 --> 00:19:25,307
You know, if you want out
of the meeting just say so...

329
00:19:25,364 --> 00:19:26,809
or don't show up like you always do...

330
00:19:26,866 --> 00:19:28,243
but this bullshit is really annoying.

331
00:19:28,334 --> 00:19:29,836
Is this gonna take a long time?

332
00:19:29,935 --> 00:19:32,040
You know, you're getting worse.

333
00:19:32,138 --> 00:19:33,845
You know that, right,
that you're getting worse?

334
00:19:33,939 --> 00:19:36,681
- I got a lotto do.
- In 90 minutes?

335
00:19:36,776 --> 00:19:37,948
Less.

336
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:39,182
Family?

337

683
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:52,104
- I wanted to get it off my chest!
- And you had to wait till now?

684

Not my fault ifs now or never!

773
00:44:51,489 --> 00:44:54,333
They say that love is pure and generous.

774
00:44:54,392 --> 00:44:55,871
It's not.

775
00:44:55,927 --> 00:44:58,669
It's small and selfish.

776
00:44:58,729 --> 00:45:01,209
You know, I wanted you at the office...

777
00:45:01,299 --> 00:45:05,509

than having you next to me.

now that I'm dying, but...

that's how life rolls out.

788
00:45:36,567 --> 00:45:41,346
The only people who don't look back
with regret are idiots and psychopaths.

789
00:45:41,405 --> 00:45:44,352
And I got a lifetime of regrets, boy.

791

not telling my father to fuck off!

793
00:45:51,682 --> 00:45:55,824
Pushing your mother away.
What a ball-less coward I am.

794
00:45:57,622 --> 00:45:59,795

'Wait for the sweets and the roses.”

802
00:46:20,711 --> 00:46:21,917
Bullshit!

803
00:46:21,979 --> 00:46:24,653
They say, “Don't get angry.
Lei it go. it's killing you."

804
00:46:24,749 --> 00:46:27,491
I say, “Fuck that!"

805
00:46:27,585 --> 00:46:29,622
Anger's the only thing they left me!

806
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:32,997
Anger is my refuge!
It's my shield!

807
00:46:33,090 --> 00:46:35,001

00:59:53,990 --> 00:59:57,597
But you have to promise me
to stay calm and to not get angry.

1018
00:59:57,661 --> 01:00:01,404
And afterwards,
we go directly to the hospital.

1019
01:00:01,465 --> 01:00:04,571
No drama. No complaints.

1020
01:00:05,769 --> 01:00:07,248
Okay?

1021
01:00:11,274 --> 01:00:12,912

No, wait!
Wait, wait, wait! Stop! Stop!

I am a board certified
doctor of internal medicine...

1070
01:02:48,164 --> 01:02:51,373
and I really don't like it
when people don't listen to me!

01:02:51,434 --> 01:02:53,641
When I say, “Stay calm”...

1072
01:02:53,737 --> 01:02:56,843
I... mean... calm!

1073
01:02:56,940 --> 01:02:59,250
Is that so damn hard to understand?

1074
01:02:59,309 --> 01:03:02,119
- No, not at all.
- Then get in the damn car!

1075
01:03:03,380 --> 01:03:04,859
Are we stealing this cab?

1076
01:03:04,948 --> 01:03:07,121
Do you wanna see your son by 6:22?

1077
01:03:07,183 --> 01:03:09,663
- Yes, ma'am.
- Then get in the car.

1078
01:03:17,861 --> 01:03:19,807
You don't own a car, do you?

1079
01:03:19,863 --> 01:03:22,036
No. Why?

1080
01:03:27,003 --> 01:03:29,279
Okay. Okay. Okay.

1081
01:03:29,339 --> 01:03:30,647
Relax. Relax.

1082
01:03:30,740 --> 01:03:32,310
Relax, yeah. How?

1083
01:03:32,409 --> 01:03:34,980
You're just as bad as your brother.

1084
01:03:35,045 --> 01:03:37,025
You drove Aaron?

1085
01:03:37,113 --> 01:03:39,491
He didn't approve of the way
the cab driver was driving.

1086
01:03:39,582 --> 01:03:41,323
Well, he can be a bit timid.

1087
01:03:41,418 --> 01:03:43,989
He sure loved me.

1088
01:03:44,054 --> 01:03:46,830
I was so lucky to have
a younger brother like that.

1089
01:03:46,890 --> 01:03:48,426
It's a gift.

1090
01:03:48,491 --> 01:03:50,528
That's why I wanted two kids.

1091
01:03:54,164 --> 01:03:57,338
- Did your two boys love each other'?
- I think so.

1092
01:03:57,434 --> 01:04:00,313
- In their own way.
- Yeah?

1093
01:04:00,370 --> 01:04:02,008
They were very different.

1094
01:04:03,773 --> 01:04:05,446
L-I was an only child.

1095
01:04:08,211 --> 01:04:09,918
It must've been lonely.

1096
01:04:11,548 --> 01:04:13,858
- I didn't think so.
- Really?

1097
01:04:15,251 --> 01:04:17,253
Now how do you feel?

1098
01:04:19,189 --> 01:04:22,170
You wonder who's gonna be there
when something happens.

1099
01:04:23,393 --> 01:04:25,100
Like dying.

1100
01:04:26,096 --> 01:04:27,700
Like dying.

1101
01:04:32,635 --> 01:04:34,080
Do you see this?

1102
01:04:35,638 --> 01:04:37,276
I see it.

1103
01:04:38,742 --> 01:04:40,346
Punch it.

1104
01:04:47,117 --> 01:04:49,358
Oh, yeah!

1105
01:04:49,419 --> 01:04:51,126
- Okay. Okay-
- Yeah, yeah, yeah!

1106
01:04:51,221 --> 01:04:53,394
Calm, calm, calm, calm!

1107
01:04:53,490 --> 01:04:56,664

- and this is a medical emergency-
- License and registration.

1112
01:05:15,745 --> 01:05:19,215
I understand.
This is my patient, Henry Altmann.

1113
01:05:19,282 --> 01:05:21,057
- He needs brain surgery.
- Do you have a license?

1114
01:05:21,117 --> 01:05:23,688
No, I don't. Not on me.

This your cab?

1116
01:05:26,122 --> 01:05:27,863
No. Yes!

1117
01:05:27,924 --> 01:05:30,336
Well, it's my uncle's.

1118
01:05:32,762 --> 01:05:33,900
No?

1119
01:05:35,331 --> 01:05:37,777
- Yeah, I got nothing.
- I got this.

1120
01:05:37,867 --> 01:05:40,279
- What are you gonna do'?
- Tell him the truth.

1121
01:05:40,336 --> 01:05:42,111
Oh, this ought to be interesting.

1122
01:05:42,172 --> 01:05:45,642
Officer, a little over an hour ago,
this cab hit my car.

1123
01:05:45,742 --> 01:05:49,121
Then I went to the hospital
and Dr. Gill told me that I had a brain aneurysm...

1124
01:05:49,179 --> 01:05:51,352
- and I had 90 minutes to live.
- From the car accident.

1125
01:05:51,448 --> 01:05:54,088
No. Then I went to my office
and this guy was telling a joke...

1126
01:05:54,150 --> 01:05:56,562
about a man having sex with his wife
one last time, and I thought...

1127
01:05:56,619 --> 01:05:59,361
“Hey, that sounds like a good idea.
I'll go home and try it with mine.”

1128
01:05:59,456 --> 01:06:01,129
I get there and there's my wife
sitting with my neighbor.

1129
01:06:01,191 --> 01:06:03,933
Turns out they've been shtupping
the whole time and I had no idea.

1130
01:06:03,993 --> 01:06:05,666
So I get out of there and I go to Juniors...

1131
01:06:05,762 --> 01:06:08,470
and I invited all these people to say good-bye
to them and only one guy shows up...

1132
01:06:08,565 --> 01:06:10,374
and he's pissed off at me
for stealing his high school sweetheart...

1133
01:06:10,467 --> 01:06:12,743
- who I don't even remember!
- Calm. Calm.

1134
01:06:12,802 --> 01:06:16,978
So I go across the street
to buy a video camera from this nice guy.

1135
01:06:17,040 --> 01:06:20,385
A little bit- D-D-D-D- But still a good guy.
Not the fastest salesman.

1136
01:06:20,477 --> 01:06:23,287
And I give the video camera to a homeless guy
to videotape me talking to my son.

1137
01:06:23,346 --> 01:06:25,155
And I get a little upset
because after law school...

1138
01:06:25,215 --> 01:06:27,126
he decides to be a dance instructor
rather than a lawyer.

1139
01:06:27,183 --> 01:06:29,026
- The homeless guy?
- No, my son.

1140
01:06:29,118 --> 01:06:31,155
I had all these business cards printed up.
But what can you do?

1141
01:06:31,221 --> 01:06:32,791
I got upset and then I passed out.

1142
01:06:32,856 --> 01:06:34,767
And when I came 10,
I jumped off the Brooklyn Bridge.

1143
01:06:34,824 --> 01:06:36,633
That's when she shows up.
She jumps in the East River.

1144
01:06:36,693 --> 01:06:38,331
She fishes me out.
That's why we're wet.

1145
01:06:38,394 --> 01:06:40,396
Then we got picked up
by the same cabbie who hit me earlier.

1146
01:06:40,497 --> 01:06:42,977
She maces him
and that's how we got this cab.

1147
01:06:45,201 --> 01:06:47,181
- Weird, huh?
- Yeah.

1148
01:06:47,237 --> 01:06:50,081
You weren't kidding
about him needing brain surgery.

1149
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:53,543
No, no, no, not at all!

1150
01:06:53,643 --> 01:06:55,850
- Oh, thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1151
01:06:55,945 --> 01:06:58,016
Please step out of the vehicle.

1152
01:06:58,081 --> 01:07:01,893
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
Um... hold on. Okay.

1153
01:07:01,985 --> 01:07:04,898
Please This, uh- This is-

1154
01:07:04,988 --> 01:07:09,664
This is the hospital.
Just ask for Dr. Jordan Reed.

1155
01:07:12,629 --> 01:07:14,040

This is N.Y.P.D.

1158

You know a Dr. Gill and a Mr. Altmann?

1159
01:07:26,876 --> 01:07:28,355
Holy shit!

1160
01:07:29,646 --> 01:07:31,387
- What hospital?
- Maimonides.

1161
01:07:31,447 --> 01:07:32,687
- Follow me.
- Yes, sir.

1162
01:07:32,749 --> 01:07:34,888
- Try to keep up.
- I will try, sir. I will try.

1163
01:07:34,984 --> 01:07:37,464
Thank you so much, Officer.

1164
01:07:39,589 --> 01:07:41,830
- You're not gonna follow him, are you'?
- Oh, fuck, no.

1165
01:07:43,526 --> 01:07:45,733
Yes! You go, girl!

1166
01:07:45,828 --> 01:07:48,138
Whoo!

1167
01:07:54,437 --> 01:07:56,280
- Did he call?
- No.

1168
01:07:58,274 --> 01:08:00,686
He might not try you here again.

1169
01:08:00,743 --> 01:08:04,384
- What if he dies before I talk to him?
- Don't go there.

1170
01:08:04,447 --> 01:08:06,017
Well, I didn't take the call.

1171
01:08:06,082 --> 01:08:08,585
It's not your fault. He's-

1172
01:08:10,954 --> 01:08:12,490
He wasn't always.

1173
01:08:14,023 --> 01:08:18,301
Like, when I was seven,
he taught me how to play gin rummy.

1174
01:08:18,394 --> 01:08:21,273
I hated it 'cause I could never beat him.

1175
01:08:22,398 --> 01:08:24,571
So he taught me how to cheat.

1176
01:08:26,636 --> 01:08:29,708
He was so big and loud and fun.

1177
01:08:32,875 --> 01:08:34,616
Then Peter died.

1178
01:08:36,045 --> 01:08:37,524
And I left.

1179
01:08:42,285 --> 01:08:44,265
And everything changed.

1180
01:08:46,656 --> 01:08:49,603
He used to be so affectionate.

1181
01:08:49,659 --> 01:08:52,435
He was like a major hugger.

1182
01:08:57,367 --> 01:08:59,540
Hasn't done that in a while.

1183
01:09:01,104 --> 01:09:02,447
