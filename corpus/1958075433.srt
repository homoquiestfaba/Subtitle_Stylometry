1
00:01:35,128 --> 00:01:36,152
Mr. Rockford.

2
00:01:36,263 --> 00:01:37,822
Good morning, Mr. Zucker.

3
00:01:37,898 --> 00:01:39,457
I can still get you down
on the Otters.

4
00:01:39,533 --> 00:01:41,001
New spread is eight.

5
00:01:41,368 --> 00:01:43,462
But it's a straddle if you
plan to match the bet on the

6
00:01:43,537 --> 00:01:45,505
Detroit-Pittsburgh game.
I'm still trying

7
00:01:45,572 --> 00:01:48,234
to get over the pounding I
took during basketball season.

8
00:01:48,842 --> 00:01:50,241
Buy you a kick-start before
breakfast?

9
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:53,177
Ah, I'm not much
of a morning drinker, Zookie.

10
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:56,215
Morning, Jim.
Miss Trudy.

11
00:01:56,316 --> 00:01:57,306
Zookie.
Good morning.

12
00:01:57,417 --> 00:01:59,442
Hey, morning, Mr. R.
Hi, Carlos.

13
00:02:00,087 --> 00:02:01,077
Gents.

14
00:02:01,154 --> 00:02:02,144
Jim.

15
00:02:02,389 --> 00:02:03,618
ROCKFORD: Good morning, Leon.

16
00:02:04,024 --> 00:02:06,049
Ain't no morning a good
morning, Jim.

17
00:02:06,627 --> 00:02:07,924
Take a look at those
idiots out there

18
00:02:07,995 --> 00:02:09,429
workin' on their melanomas.

19
00:02:10,597 --> 00:02:11,723
Makes me sick.

20
00:02:12,566 --> 00:02:14,330
Ain't nothin' goin' right
for me these days.

21
00:02:15,002 --> 00:02:16,629
Things get better, I promise.

22
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:18,430
Well, how they gonna
get better

23
00:02:18,505 --> 00:02:20,667
when I gotta float olives
for 10:00 drinkers?

24
00:02:21,241 --> 00:02:22,231
No offense, Zookie.

25
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:23,299
None taken.

26
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:34,317
Before long, he'll be
standing outside

27
00:02:34,388 --> 00:02:35,822
waiting for us to open up.

28
00:02:36,056 --> 00:02:37,649
He's getting here
earlier and earlier.

29
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:39,015
Who?

30
00:02:39,393 --> 00:02:41,088
Zookie the Bookie.
It breaks my heart.

31
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:42,993
I'm really worried
about him, Jim.

32
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:45,430
He's starting to resemble
Mr. Potato Head.

33
00:02:45,532 --> 00:02:47,432
Ah, well, I guess.
You know, at his age...

34
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:49,060
You call Dennis Becker
about that...

35
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:51,031
That thing
we talked about?

36
00:02:51,571 --> 00:02:52,697
Oh, Babs.

37
00:02:53,407 --> 00:02:54,897
Babs, I talked to him,

38
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:57,340
oh, at least five times
on it last year.

39
00:02:57,678 --> 00:03:00,306
Uh, I thought since
there's really nothing new...

40
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:01,870
You didn't call him,
did you?

41
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:04,817
I talked to him three times
last month alone.

42
00:03:04,918 --> 00:03:06,317
There's nothing there, Babs.

43
00:03:06,787 --> 00:03:08,221
Becker's getting
angry with me.

44
00:03:08,989 --> 00:03:10,616
Hey, morning, Mr. R.

45
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:12,623
Saw you comin' across
through the window.

46
00:03:13,093 --> 00:03:14,788
Had Pablo put 'em
on the grill for you.

47
00:03:15,796 --> 00:03:16,991
Thanks, Carlos.

48
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:22,198
I hired a forensic lab
in Torrance.

49
00:03:22,502 --> 00:03:24,834
They do like autopsies
on poisoned animals,

50
00:03:24,905 --> 00:03:27,670
cats and stuff who die
under peculiar circumstances.

51
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:29,873
They do fecal studies
and urinalysis,

52
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:32,809
just like the LA Coroner's Office,
only with animals.

53
00:03:32,979 --> 00:03:34,276
Good idea.
I also sent "em

54
00:03:34,414 --> 00:03:36,314
a copy of Cal's autopsy report

55
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:38,010
that the LA Coroner's
Office gave me.

56
00:03:38,118 --> 00:03:39,108
And guess what?

57
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,381
They agree with me.

58
00:03:41,922 --> 00:03:43,083
They did? Well, good.

59
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:46,222
It all fits, Jim.

60
00:03:46,526 --> 00:03:47,960
I got a new time of death.

61
00:03:48,161 --> 00:03:51,187
He was killed at Joseph
Cortello's house after work,

62
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:53,926
like I said,
at 5:30 p.m.

63
00:03:54,201 --> 00:03:55,532
Then they took him
away in a car

64
00:03:55,635 --> 00:03:57,103
and dumped him
in that canyon.

65
00:03:59,106 --> 00:04:01,131
He always had peanut butter
sandwiches for lunch.

66
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:02,198
You remember that?

67
00:04:02,843 --> 00:04:04,004
Yeah, ever since he was a kid.

68
00:04:05,112 --> 00:04:08,138
This animal lab said
the gastric intestinal juices

69
00:04:08,215 --> 00:04:10,912
dissolve stomach contents
at about two liters an hour.

70
00:04:11,318 --> 00:04:12,308
Okay,

71
00:04:12,552 --> 00:04:15,647
this peanut butter sandwich
was only partially digested.

72
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:18,219
The stomach bile
and colonic enzymes

73
00:04:18,325 --> 00:04:19,918
were only partially occluded.

74
00:04:19,993 --> 00:04:22,223
That's what they call
bowel blocked ingestion.

75
00:04:22,329 --> 00:04:23,319
Occlusion.

76
00:04:23,463 --> 00:04:25,989
He still had undigested
deviled eggs,

77
00:04:26,066 --> 00:04:27,932
peanut butter and soda
in his stomach,

78
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:30,561
so he died earlier
than they said.

79
00:04:30,704 --> 00:04:32,729
His colon hadn't
processed the contents.

80
00:04:32,806 --> 00:04:35,002
It was still just
bile-soaked stomach matter.

81
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:38,267
Where you goin', Jim?

82
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:41,710
Something the matter
with your omelet?

83
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:46,248
No, no, the omelet's
just fine.

84
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:48,785
Babs, honey,

85
00:04:49,756 --> 00:04:52,225
you have got to let this go.

86
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,350
Let it go?

87
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:56,661
This mobster kills my son,

88
00:04:57,197 --> 00:04:59,256
the police don't arrest him,
they don't do anything...

89
00:04:59,366 --> 00:05:00,356
Because you can't prove it.

90
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:01,999
Well, you watch me prove it.

91
00:05:02,836 --> 00:05:04,361
They don't call
Joseph Cortello

92
00:05:04,437 --> 00:05:06,132
"Happy" Cortello
because he's happy.

93
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:08,202
Why do they call him "Happy"?

94
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:10,299
I don't know.

95
00:05:10,911 --> 00:05:13,437
The point is,
he's a very dangerous guy.

96
00:05:14,047 --> 00:05:15,139
You know,

97
00:05:15,448 --> 00:05:17,314
they picked him up
on your say-so alone

98
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:19,680
because I asked Dennis
Becker to do me a favor.

99
00:05:20,086 --> 00:05:21,383
And there was no proof.

100
00:05:21,621 --> 00:05:24,090
He had a great alibi.
He was in church.

101
00:05:24,691 --> 00:05:25,715
You know,
Cal was up there

102
00:05:25,792 --> 00:05:27,556
painting Cortello's
pool house.

103
00:05:27,761 --> 00:05:29,354
Ten hours later
they found him dead

104
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:30,964
in the bushes
below Mulholland.

105
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:32,799
That's all you have.

106
00:05:33,233 --> 00:05:34,962
That's not probable
cause for an arrest.

107
00:05:35,035 --> 00:05:36,525
Jim, the guy is a gangster.

108
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,661
Oh, he's much more
than a gangster.

109
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:40,864
He's a rich,
influential gangster.

110
00:05:41,274 --> 00:05:42,571
You don't want to lose
that thought, Babs.

111
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:44,508
Well, you may be afraid
of him, but I'm not.

112
00:05:44,644 --> 00:05:45,770
You know what I'm doing?

113
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:47,973
Oh, boy.
Oh, boy, is right.

114
00:05:48,782 --> 00:05:49,840
I'm staking him out.

115
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:50,974
What?

116
00:05:51,084 --> 00:05:53,416
Every night, I park across
the street from his house.

117
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,885
I take down
license plates and

118
00:05:54,955 --> 00:05:56,423
descriptions of people
coming and going.

119
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:57,854
I am going to get this guy.

120
00:05:58,124 --> 00:05:59,888
He can't kill my son
and just walk away.

121
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,491
Why would Hap Cortello
kill him?

122
00:06:01,561 --> 00:06:02,653
He saw something.

123
00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:03,719
He saw something?

124
00:06:03,797 --> 00:06:07,062
Well, duh. He,
he saw some slimy deal go down,

125
00:06:07,133 --> 00:06:08,623
and this pasta-head
gets nervous,

126
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:09,794
goes after him
and kills him.

127
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:11,304
But you don't have
any proof, Babs

128
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:12,361
I will have.

129
00:06:18,578 --> 00:06:20,171
I'm sorry you're not
willing to help me.

130
00:06:20,747 --> 00:06:21,737
I thought we were friends.

131
00:06:26,253 --> 00:06:27,379
Babs.

132
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:30,550
Babs, you can't
just park your car

133
00:06:30,624 --> 00:06:31,614
in front of this guy's house

134
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:32,954
and then go following
him around.

135
00:06:33,026 --> 00:06:34,152
You're gonna get him angry.

136
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:36,628
Good. He got me angry,
SO now we're even.

137
00:06:36,963 --> 00:06:37,953
Excuse me.

138
00:06:54,781 --> 00:06:55,771
Hey, Babs.

139
00:06:57,851 --> 00:06:59,080
Can I buy you a drink?

140
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,920
We can watch the sunset
and make up.

141
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:04,917
No need to make up.
I gotta go.

142
00:07:04,991 --> 00:07:06,254
I'll see you tomorrow,
Jim. No, no, no.

143
00:07:06,326 --> 00:07:07,350
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

144
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:09,122
Come on, now.
Now, hold it, Babs.

145
00:07:09,462 --> 00:07:10,486
Babs, honey...

146
00:07:10,664 --> 00:07:13,395
Look, honey,
I'm your friend, I really am.

147
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,490
And as your friend

148
00:07:15,001 --> 00:07:16,901
and a seasoned professional
in police science,

149
00:07:17,037 --> 00:07:18,562
I have to tell you
that sitting out in front

150
00:07:18,638 --> 00:07:21,073
of Hap Cortello's house
is a uniquely bad idea.

151
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:23,038
Goodnight, Jim. No,
no. Wait, wait, wait.

152
00:07:23,176 --> 00:07:24,735
Hold it, hold it, hold it. Hey,
get out. I gotta go!

153
00:07:24,878 --> 00:07:27,745
No,
hold it. Just hold it. Wait a minute.

154
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:30,417
Cal was killed, when,
18 months ago?

155
00:07:30,483 --> 00:07:31,541
Eighteen months,
three weeks... Yeah.

156
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:32,710
...four days,
and depending on

157
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:34,220
which lab you believe,

158
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:35,516
10 to 20 hours ago.

159
00:07:35,588 --> 00:07:36,612
And the police found nothing.

160
00:07:36,723 --> 00:07:37,918
Get out of my car.
I'm late.

161
00:07:38,024 --> 00:07:39,355
No, no, I can't let you go.

162
00:07:39,426 --> 00:07:41,121
Well, it's not up to you.
Now, get out!

163
00:07:41,394 --> 00:07:42,657
Just hold it, hold it,
hold it.

164
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:44,855
You, you go up there
and you do what?

165
00:07:44,931 --> 00:07:46,695
What, you park down the
street, around the corner,

166
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:48,131
out of sight or something? No,
I park

167
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:49,498
right across
from his driveway.

168
00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:51,435
This is a
straight-in-your-face stakeout.

169
00:07:51,504 --> 00:07:52,972
I want this jerk to see me.

170
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:54,700
I want him to know
I'm not through with him.

171
00:07:54,774 --> 00:07:56,572
I'm mad.
Now, get out.

172
00:07:57,344 --> 00:07:59,073
(SIGHS)
I'm coming with you.

173
00:07:59,612 --> 00:08:01,046
I thought you didn't want
to mess with this.

174
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:03,343
I didn't say I didn't want
to mess with it.

175
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:04,882
I said there was no evidence.

176
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,189
But I can't let you commit
suicide either, so let's go.

177
00:08:10,857 --> 00:08:12,086
Come on, come on.

178
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:29,737
Look, we're more obvious
than Quakers at a barn dance.

179
00:08:29,809 --> 00:08:31,709
Back up.
Go back down the street.

180
00:08:31,778 --> 00:08:34,338
Why? I want him to know
I know what a jerk he is.

181
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:35,982
If I can't catch him
for Cal's murder,

182
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:37,642
I'll catch him doing
something else.

183
00:08:37,951 --> 00:08:38,941
That ought to scare him.

184
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:40,443
You're not gonna scare him.

185
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,818
Guys like Hap Cortello
don't scare.

186
00:08:43,423 --> 00:08:45,551
You're gonna flip him off,
is what you're gonna do.

187
00:08:46,059 --> 00:08:47,788
You know, you want to catch
him, just back up,

188
00:08:47,894 --> 00:08:49,692
do what I tell you,
before we get hurt.

189
00:08:58,972 --> 00:09:00,736
Is this far enough
back for you,

190
00:09:01,274 --> 00:09:02,673
or should we park in Tarzan a?

191
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:05,401
Babs, you asked me
to help you,

192
00:09:05,478 --> 00:09:07,913
I'm here.
Stop attacking me.

193
00:09:13,486 --> 00:09:14,681
(EXHALES DEEPLY)

194
00:09:15,355 --> 00:09:17,187
(DOGS BARKING IN DISTANCE)

195
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:20,149
I don't know, Jim.

196
00:09:22,429 --> 00:09:24,022
You work so hard
to raise your kids,

197
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:26,724
and Cal turns out
so good, and...

198
00:09:28,034 --> 00:09:29,024
...dies.

199
00:09:29,369 --> 00:09:31,098
I love both my boys,

200
00:09:32,338 --> 00:09:34,670
but Corey can be such
a little jerk sometimes.

201
00:09:35,608 --> 00:09:37,906
He's out there sellin' drugs,
gettin' busted.

202
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:40,838
It's like they weren't
even brothers.

203
00:09:41,314 --> 00:09:42,645
Yeah, I know.

204
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:52,981
I never could understand

205
00:09:53,193 --> 00:09:55,287
how brothers could
be so different.

206
00:09:57,030 --> 00:10:00,466
I keep thinking maybe
it's my fault.

207
00:10:01,067 --> 00:10:03,593
Maybe I tried harder
with Cal than Corey.

208
00:10:04,704 --> 00:10:06,638
But then I remember
Cal's gardening business

209
00:10:06,706 --> 00:10:08,174
when he was just six.
(CHUCKLES)

210
00:10:09,075 --> 00:10:11,305
You remember him pullin'
weeds with that little red wagon

211
00:10:11,377 --> 00:10:12,936
so I wouldn't have
to work any more?

212
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:14,547
I remember he signed me up.

213
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:17,315
Weeding the pots around
my trailer, watering.

214
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:18,540
Dollar a day.

215
00:10:18,985 --> 00:10:20,510
Best buy I ever had
on a gardener.

216
00:10:21,054 --> 00:10:22,886
And he always gave me
what he made.

217
00:10:23,523 --> 00:10:27,790
He said, "Mom, I'm gonna
make you so proud.

218
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:30,862
"One day, I'm gonna buy
you a house and a maid,

219
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:33,592
"so you won't ever have
to wait on anybody again."

220
00:10:34,267 --> 00:10:35,735
And then he made
all A's in school

221
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:37,793
and was workin' his own
way through college.

222
00:10:38,104 --> 00:10:41,005
Yeah, Rocky was probably
the best judge

223
00:10:41,074 --> 00:10:42,838
of character
I ever knew.

224
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:44,739
When Cal died, he...

225
00:10:45,445 --> 00:10:47,243
Rocky said,

226
00:10:47,714 --> 00:10:51,412
"He was so good,
God could only loan him to us."

227
00:10:52,085 --> 00:10:53,416
Yeah, well...

228
00:10:55,588 --> 00:10:59,718
While Cal was pulling weeds,
Corey was pulling car radios.

229
00:11:00,293 --> 00:11:01,818
He got yours once, I recall.

230
00:11:01,895 --> 00:11:03,363
Yeah, well, he didn't
really get it all the way.

231
00:11:03,429 --> 00:11:05,989
I mean,
just sort of halfway out. He broke it.

232
00:11:06,199 --> 00:11:07,564
Yeah, I guess.

233
00:11:08,101 --> 00:11:11,071
And he stole from
Mr. Critchland at the Sand Castle.

234
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:14,306
And with doing drugs
and everything...

235
00:11:16,876 --> 00:11:18,275
So who goes and dies?

236
00:11:18,611 --> 00:11:21,273
I know that is a horrible
thing to say.

237
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:24,915
But I loved that boy,

238
00:11:25,652 --> 00:11:27,916
and he tried so hard,
and now he's gone,

239
00:11:28,555 --> 00:11:30,489
and there is nobody
left except me

240
00:11:30,557 --> 00:11:32,457
to give his soul rest.

241
00:11:35,728 --> 00:11:38,493
(CRYING)
Why?

242
00:11:38,831 --> 00:11:39,992
Why him?

243
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:42,024
(GATE OPENING)

244
00:11:44,637 --> 00:11:46,036
ROCKFORD: There he is.

245
00:11:47,173 --> 00:11:48,163
BABS: Okay.

246
00:12:09,262 --> 00:12:10,787
You're, you're too close.

247
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:12,227
He's gonna see us.

248
00:12:14,467 --> 00:12:15,525
I want him to see us.

249
00:12:15,602 --> 00:12:17,297
Jim, I always do it this way.

250
00:12:18,605 --> 00:12:19,663
Just drop back.

251
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:21,537
We're trying to tail him,
not tick him off.

252
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:24,502
Stay back, Babs.

253
00:12:25,912 --> 00:12:27,311
Do it my way, will you?

254
00:12:32,986 --> 00:12:34,215
Well, don't stop.

255
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:36,245
Oh.

256
00:12:43,229 --> 00:12:44,219
(LAUGHING)

257
00:12:44,397 --> 00:12:45,387
BABS: Look at him.

258
00:12:45,465 --> 00:12:48,264
We should knock that smile
of his right into the dirt.

259
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:49,758
We?

260
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:53,428
Hi.

261
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:57,266
Now, look...

262
00:12:57,343 --> 00:12:58,333
(GROANING)

263
00:12:59,012 --> 00:13:00,673
BABS: Oh, my God! Jim?

264
00:13:01,514 --> 00:13:02,948
Hey, hey, hey.

265
00:13:04,684 --> 00:13:06,618
I usually don't hit a skirt,

266
00:13:07,086 --> 00:13:08,554
but you keep at it, honey,

267
00:13:08,721 --> 00:13:10,849
you're gonna be mewing
in the grass with him.

268
00:13:11,257 --> 00:13:12,782
Now, you got it? Huh?

269
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:18,461
BABS: Jim. Jim.

270
00:13:18,531 --> 00:13:19,555
Oh.

271
00:13:22,168 --> 00:13:23,158
CORTELLO: Let's go.

272
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:24,626
(GROANS)

273
00:13:28,841 --> 00:13:31,742
Well, now we know
why they call him "Happy."

274
00:13:35,715 --> 00:13:37,114
COP: Joseph "Happy" Cortello?

275
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:38,681
You want to file
assault charges?

276
00:13:38,918 --> 00:13:40,545
You're damned right.
Assault and battery,

277
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:42,849
public endangerment,
illegal parking,

278
00:13:43,089 --> 00:13:44,648
grinning hideously in public.

279
00:13:44,724 --> 00:13:45,953
You make the list,
I'll sign it.

280
00:13:46,025 --> 00:13:47,117
So I'll sign
the complaint, too.

281
00:13:47,193 --> 00:13:48,888
I'm a witness.
No, you won't.

282
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:50,963
We don't need you on
the complaint. I'm plenty.

283
00:13:51,464 --> 00:13:53,626
It might leave a little scar,
but it's mostly in a wrinkle,

284
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,600
so it shouldn't show too much.

285
00:13:55,935 --> 00:13:58,063
Well, my modeling agent
is gonna be crazed.

286
00:13:58,237 --> 00:13:59,329
Where do I sign this thing?

287
00:13:59,405 --> 00:14:00,395
Right there, sir.

288
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:01,496
You go get him.

289
00:14:01,808 --> 00:14:03,071
I'll come in and put
the hat on him

290
00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:04,677
soon as he's hooked
and booked.

291
00:14:05,044 --> 00:14:07,035
Uh, don't take this
the wrong way, Mr. Rockford,

292
00:14:07,246 --> 00:14:10,011
but this kind of thing
has happened in this precinct

293
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:11,482
once or twice before, okay?

294
00:14:11,784 --> 00:14:13,218
Often, people have
a change of heart.

295
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:14,782
Now, I don't want to have
to go down and pick up

296
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:17,050
Mr. Cortello and go through
all that legal BS

297
00:14:17,123 --> 00:14:19,717
unless you are absolutely sure
you're gonna press charges.

298
00:14:19,792 --> 00:14:21,783
I am so sure,
my palms are itching.

299
00:14:21,894 --> 00:14:22,884
Go get him.

300
00:14:23,096 --> 00:14:24,621
Okay. It's gonna take
about 10 hours

301
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:25,687
to get the warrant produced,

302
00:14:25,765 --> 00:14:27,233
and the booking desk
will call you, sir.

303
00:14:28,801 --> 00:14:29,791
Now, you see?

304
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:32,729
Now, I don't mean
to be an I-told-you-so,

305
00:14:33,072 --> 00:14:35,063
but you see what happens
when you tail so close?

306
00:14:35,174 --> 00:14:37,040
Honest, Jim,
I don't get it.

307
00:14:37,276 --> 00:14:38,971
You said, "Stay back,
stay back,"

308
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:40,945
but I, I never stay back,

309
00:14:41,013 --> 00:14:42,344
and I've been following
him a month

310
00:14:42,448 --> 00:14:44,280
and this is the first time
it happened.

311
00:14:50,156 --> 00:14:51,555
Jim.
Zookie.

312
00:14:51,991 --> 00:14:53,186
You guys are here early.

313
00:14:53,292 --> 00:14:55,488
Eh. Head hurt,
couldn't sleep.

314
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:57,029
Got up, my hands
started shaking.

315
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:58,120
Me too.

316
00:14:59,499 --> 00:15:00,762
Babs here yet?

317
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:03,297
Her day off.
It's Saturday.

318
00:15:03,469 --> 00:15:04,493
Ah, I forgot.

319
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,072
Morning, Jim.
Ah, Miss Trudy.

320
00:15:09,242 --> 00:15:10,869
Zookie. LEON: Hey,
what happened, Jim?

321
00:15:10,943 --> 00:15:12,638
Somebody bounce you
like a bad check?

322
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:14,676
Leon, Zookie,

323
00:15:15,047 --> 00:15:17,038
let me run something
by you guys.

324
00:15:17,483 --> 00:15:19,611
If it's gonna run,
let's get a bet down first.

325
00:15:19,852 --> 00:15:21,616
CARLOS: Hey, morning, Mr. R.

326
00:15:21,854 --> 00:15:23,253
Hey, Carlos.

327
00:15:23,656 --> 00:15:25,317
Well, last night, heh,

328
00:15:25,892 --> 00:15:27,587
seems I got into a little tiff

329
00:15:28,127 --> 00:15:30,687
with a guy named
Joseph Cortello.

330
00:15:31,531 --> 00:15:32,623
Happy Cortello?
Yeah.

331
00:15:32,698 --> 00:15:34,325
You're kiddin' me. He
did that to you? Yeah.

332
00:15:34,634 --> 00:15:35,897
Giggling all
the time, I bet.

333
00:15:35,968 --> 00:15:36,992
That's why they call
him "Happy."

334
00:15:37,069 --> 00:15:39,470
He's got this over-active
adrenal gland.

335
00:15:39,705 --> 00:15:40,695
When he gets excited,

336
00:15:41,174 --> 00:15:43,666
he pumps too much adrenaline
and, uh, starts laughin'.

337
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:45,500
Can't control himself.

338
00:15:46,045 --> 00:15:48,742
I could have really used that
information yesterday, Zookie.

339
00:15:48,981 --> 00:15:50,142
What's your question, Jim?

340
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:51,614
Well, you know, this guy,

341
00:15:52,251 --> 00:15:54,219
he never let me get set.
He got me off balance,

342
00:15:54,353 --> 00:15:55,479
slammed me around.

343
00:15:55,721 --> 00:15:57,382
I don't usually get
marked up like this.

344
00:15:57,457 --> 00:15:59,357
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, yeah,
yeah, I know that. No.

345
00:15:59,525 --> 00:16:01,186
ZOOKIE: Yeah,
we know that. Then he karate-kicked me

346
00:16:01,327 --> 00:16:03,853
a couple of times,
then threatened me, then just

347
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:05,158
got in his car
and drove off.

348
00:16:05,264 --> 00:16:06,322
LEON: Just like that, huh?

349
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:08,726
So I called the cops
last night at the hospital.

350
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:10,860
I, uh, filed a complaint
against him.

351
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,096
LEON: You what?

352
00:16:12,605 --> 00:16:13,936
Ooh.
ZOOKIE: Brave man.

353
00:16:14,006 --> 00:16:16,304
Whoa, wrong move, Jim.

354
00:16:16,576 --> 00:16:18,203
Yeah, but last night
I was mad, you know?

355
00:16:18,277 --> 00:16:19,972
I got up this morning,
and started thinkin',

356
00:16:20,046 --> 00:16:21,810
"Hey, it's a small town.

357
00:16:22,181 --> 00:16:23,910
"Everybody has a bad moment
now and then.

358
00:16:24,016 --> 00:16:25,745
"Maybe I caught Cortello
on a bad day.

359
00:16:26,118 --> 00:16:27,677
"So maybe the right thing
to do is just say,

360
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,015
<i>""Hey, no hard feelings.</i>

361
00:16:29,088 --> 00:16:30,613
"'Let's all move on
down the road.”

362
00:16:31,023 --> 00:16:32,923
It's damned sure
the right thing to do,

363
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,050
unless you want
to take advantage

364
00:16:34,126 --> 00:16:35,651
of Forest Lawn's
annual special.

365
00:16:35,928 --> 00:16:38,158
Oh, not that I'm scared
of this melt-down.

366
00:16:38,231 --> 00:16:39,221
I can handle him.

367
00:16:39,298 --> 00:16:40,788
ZOOKIE: Sure, you can. Oh,
yeah, you can. I know.

368
00:16:40,933 --> 00:16:42,833
Stuff happens.
Absolutely.

369
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:44,629
Exactly.
Exactly.

370
00:16:48,608 --> 00:16:49,837
Do you have Babs' address?

371
00:16:49,976 --> 00:16:51,774
I haven't been
to her new place and,

372
00:16:52,178 --> 00:16:53,509
you know, I called her,
but she didn't answer.

373
00:16:53,613 --> 00:16:55,081
I thought I'd just go on
up there and tell her.

374
00:16:55,147 --> 00:16:56,444
She was a witness.
I don't want her

375
00:16:56,616 --> 00:16:57,879
callin' the cops or anything,

376
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:59,475
since I'm gonna
withdraw the complaint.

377
00:16:59,752 --> 00:17:01,481
Babs. Of course.

378
00:17:02,555 --> 00:17:03,920
This is all about
her kid, isn't it?

379
00:17:04,223 --> 00:17:05,349
She got you into this.

380
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:08,052
Aw, Jimbo, come on.
You're sharper than that.

381
00:17:08,327 --> 00:17:09,522
LEON: No kidding.

382
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:13,230
You know, it's one thing for
Babs to get stuck on stupid.

383
00:17:14,066 --> 00:17:15,363
It's her kid
that got murdered.

384
00:17:15,501 --> 00:17:17,128
But you're supposed
to be a pro.

385
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:19,268
Now, you oughta know better.

386
00:17:19,605 --> 00:17:20,868
Just give me
the damned address.

387
00:17:25,177 --> 00:17:26,167
(LAUGHING)
That one.

388
00:17:53,639 --> 00:17:55,038
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

389
00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:25,200
Barbara?

390
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,371
Barbara?

391
00:18:31,877 --> 00:18:33,174
Hey, Babs?

392
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:37,272
Babs?

393
00:18:38,284 --> 00:18:39,342
Oh.

394
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:43,388
Oh, Babs.

395
00:18:45,257 --> 00:18:46,247
Babs.

396
00:18:52,164 --> 00:18:54,656
CHAPMAN: We're looking
for Holy Light Drive.

397
00:18:55,334 --> 00:18:56,927
Should be off Heavenly Way.

398
00:18:57,770 --> 00:18:58,965
Up on the right.

399
00:18:59,639 --> 00:19:01,971
MINISTER: The Lord is my shepherd,
I shall not want.

400
00:19:02,274 --> 00:19:04,038
He maketh me to lie down
in green pastures,

401
00:19:04,377 --> 00:19:05,776
He leadeth me
beside still waters,

402
00:19:05,845 --> 00:19:07,574
He restoreth my soul.
COREY: Hey, Rockford.

403
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:10,312
Yo, who's pickin' this up?
This looks expensive.

404
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:12,449
Shh, Corey.
It's your mom's funeral.

405
00:19:12,518 --> 00:19:14,486
...Yea, though I walk through
the valley of the shadow of death,

406
00:19:14,553 --> 00:19:17,284
I fear no evil,
for Thou art with me.

407
00:19:17,757 --> 00:19:20,124
Things haven't been goin' too
well for you, I see, huh?

408
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,486
You still drivin'
that 20-year-old

409
00:19:22,595 --> 00:19:23,790
soup can with
the eight-track?

410
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:25,153
Shush.

411
00:19:25,264 --> 00:19:27,062
...and I will dwell in the
house of the Lord forever.

412
00:19:27,266 --> 00:19:28,256
Amen.

413
00:19:28,734 --> 00:19:31,726
Our dearly departed has gone
on to be with her maker.

414
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:34,269
Yo, Rockford, let me crash
at your place tonight.

415
00:19:34,407 --> 00:19:35,897
Cops got Mom's all taped up.

416
00:19:36,242 --> 00:19:37,835
Shut up.

417
00:19:41,447 --> 00:19:43,506
MINISTER: Our memories of Babs
are personal...

418
00:19:45,384 --> 00:19:47,375
All right, all right,
let's get around here.

419
00:19:47,453 --> 00:19:48,443
Come on, everybody.

420
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:50,015
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

421
00:19:50,423 --> 00:19:51,413
Hustle it up.
Come on.

422
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:53,689
Come on.
Everybody out.

423
00:19:53,959 --> 00:19:55,393
MINISTER: ...those memories
must be shared.

424
00:19:55,628 --> 00:19:57,824
Trudy Wise, her dear friend,

425
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,623
would like to say a few words.

426
00:20:03,402 --> 00:20:06,565
Babs and I waitressed together
at the Sand Castle for, uh,

427
00:20:07,173 --> 00:20:08,800
almost 10 years.

428
00:20:10,342 --> 00:20:11,332
Babs.

429
00:20:12,478 --> 00:20:13,912
She was always there
for all of us,

430
00:20:14,346 --> 00:20:16,872
with an extra smile in the
morning if we were sad,

431
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:19,245
or a shoulder to cry on,

432
00:20:20,386 --> 00:20:22,514
or an extra 10 bucks
if we needed it.

433
00:20:28,427 --> 00:20:30,054
She would take
everyone's order,

434
00:20:30,996 --> 00:20:34,728
but what she served
was friendship.

435
00:20:37,937 --> 00:20:39,098
All right, everybody,
gather around.

436
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:40,933
Come on. Come on over here.

437
00:20:42,007 --> 00:20:44,374
All right, I want you to take
a look up there to the right,

438
00:20:44,443 --> 00:20:45,968
under that large palm tree.

439
00:20:46,512 --> 00:20:48,412
You'll see Lieutenant Becker.

440
00:20:48,848 --> 00:20:50,816
He's the officer in charge
of the case,

441
00:20:51,183 --> 00:20:52,810
and he's watching
the mourners,

442
00:20:53,452 --> 00:20:54,851
making notes.

443
00:20:55,454 --> 00:20:59,721
So, we shall have a paper
on grave site observation.

444
00:20:59,992 --> 00:21:01,824
Do we get extra credit
for that paper?

445
00:21:02,561 --> 00:21:03,824
You know, I read
Lieutenant Becker's

446
00:21:03,896 --> 00:21:06,126
homicide report
that you xeroxed.

447
00:21:06,532 --> 00:21:08,057
(SCOFFS)
What a joke.

448
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,664
I mean, I don't concur that
this was a crime of passion.

449
00:21:11,203 --> 00:21:12,602
Disorganized crime scene.

450
00:21:13,472 --> 00:21:14,667
This was a crime
of opportunity,

451
00:21:14,874 --> 00:21:16,638
no doubt about it.
She didn't know her assailant.

452
00:21:32,925 --> 00:21:35,826
CHAPMAN: Interesting.
Disorganized crime scene.

453
00:21:36,362 --> 00:21:37,727
I hope that tells us
something else.

454
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:42,328
BECKER: What's with all
these kids, Captain?

455
00:21:42,468 --> 00:21:43,799
CHAPMAN: Criminology class.

456
00:21:44,103 --> 00:21:45,127
When they're finished
at the grave site,

457
00:21:45,204 --> 00:21:47,730
I'm gonna take the class
to check out the crime scene.

458
00:21:48,374 --> 00:21:49,364
Ooh.

459
00:21:49,542 --> 00:21:52,011
BECKER: With all due respect,
sir, the woman just died.

460
00:21:52,211 --> 00:21:53,474
Forensics is still out there,

461
00:21:53,646 --> 00:21:55,876
and I can't have 20 kids
pawing through my crime scene.

462
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:57,813
No, no, no,
these are not kids,

463
00:21:57,883 --> 00:21:59,817
as you so
euphemistically put it.

464
00:21:59,885 --> 00:22:01,375
These are budding
criminologists.

465
00:22:01,487 --> 00:22:03,478
Every student
in this class has a major

466
00:22:03,556 --> 00:22:06,082
in either Criminology
or Pre-Law.

467
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:07,918
I think letting them have
a little insight into

468
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:09,791
a homicide
investigation is

469
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:11,224
just what the doctor ordered.

470
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:13,728
This is James Scott Rockford.

471
00:22:14,366 --> 00:22:15,629
Mr. Rockford found the body.

472
00:22:15,901 --> 00:22:18,199
Over the years,
he's found lots of bodies.

473
00:22:18,404 --> 00:22:20,964
He's also served time
for a Class-A felony.

474
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,603
Mr. Rockford is the local
area private detective

475
00:22:24,677 --> 00:22:26,771
who frequently visits
crime scenes

476
00:22:26,846 --> 00:22:28,541
and other human disasters.

477
00:22:28,781 --> 00:22:29,839
Captain Chapman,

478
00:22:30,049 --> 00:22:32,017
should I put him on
my list of suspects?

479
00:22:32,084 --> 00:22:34,576
I wouldn't put him on
your party list, Candace.

480
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:42,352
Who's in charge here?

481
00:22:42,628 --> 00:22:44,619
I am.
Dr. Trish George.

482
00:22:47,967 --> 00:22:50,868
We're studying this murder
for a Criminal Behavior class.

483
00:22:52,004 --> 00:22:53,733
Then you should be ashamed
of yourself.

484
00:22:54,573 --> 00:22:55,563
I beg your pardon?

485
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:57,506
A woman we cared for
just died.

486
00:22:58,911 --> 00:23:00,538
Her friends are here to pay
their last respects.

487
00:23:00,613 --> 00:23:02,911
This is not a criminal
science lab, it's a funeral.

488
00:23:02,982 --> 00:23:04,814
Uh, Jim, can I talk to you
for a minute?

489
00:23:04,884 --> 00:23:06,045
Oh, let go, Dennis.

490
00:23:06,151 --> 00:23:07,585
Just shut up and listen, okay?

491
00:23:07,853 --> 00:23:10,379
Chapman is out of line,
but you don't want to get him riled up.

492
00:23:10,489 --> 00:23:11,479
What is this?

493
00:23:11,624 --> 00:23:14,685
It's a Southwest California
University Criminology course.

494
00:23:14,894 --> 00:23:16,885
I know you feel bad
about Babs,

495
00:23:16,996 --> 00:23:18,896
but you don't want
to take on Chapman.

496
00:23:19,031 --> 00:23:20,931
This guy is leading
a field trip

497
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,900
to Babs' funeral? Why?

498
00:23:23,102 --> 00:23:24,126
Because she
was a waitress

499
00:23:24,203 --> 00:23:25,432
and he doesn't think
she counts?

500
00:23:25,504 --> 00:23:26,494
Calm down, Jim, okay?

501
00:23:26,605 --> 00:23:27,731
What if it was
the Mayor's wife?

502
00:23:27,806 --> 00:23:28,830
You don't think
he'd be bringing

503
00:23:28,941 --> 00:23:30,340
a bunch of college
kids around, do you?

504
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:31,467
Of course not, Jim.

505
00:23:31,543 --> 00:23:33,910
Chapman signed on as a guest
lecturer at the University.

506
00:23:33,979 --> 00:23:35,538
His deal is rumored
to include

507
00:23:35,614 --> 00:23:37,446
usual fees,
honorary Doctorate,

508
00:23:37,549 --> 00:23:39,574
first row basketball tickets.
Go figure.

509
00:23:39,652 --> 00:23:41,142
You're not gonna
take these kids up to

510
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:43,587
Babs' house before Forensics
even gets out of there?

511
00:23:43,789 --> 00:23:45,223
Afraid so.
It's part of Chapman's new

512
00:23:45,291 --> 00:23:46,656
community relations program.

513
00:23:46,792 --> 00:23:48,260
Show 'em how it's done,
and maybe they don't

514
00:23:48,327 --> 00:23:49,522
throw bricks at squad cars.

515
00:23:49,595 --> 00:23:51,290
Don't you just love it?

516
00:23:52,364 --> 00:23:54,059
Here we go.
Whoo.

517
00:23:55,935 --> 00:23:56,925
ROCKFORD: Great, Corey.

518
00:23:57,503 --> 00:23:59,335
Just what your mom's
funeral needed.

519
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:05,500
(CAR HORN HONKING)

520
00:24:05,644 --> 00:24:07,043
Hey, get outta there.

521
00:24:18,057 --> 00:24:19,456
Salud.

522
00:24:36,208 --> 00:24:38,939
Oh, that funeral was tough.

523
00:24:39,745 --> 00:24:41,008
I want you to know, Jim.

524
00:24:42,047 --> 00:24:44,072
Nobody thinks
it was your fault.

525
00:24:44,216 --> 00:24:45,513
No, you were just
caught playin'

526
00:24:45,617 --> 00:24:47,142
man to man
instead of zone.

527
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:48,309
Could a happened to anyone.

528
00:24:48,454 --> 00:24:51,253
Thanks, Zookie,
but it is my fault.

529
00:24:52,458 --> 00:24:55,325
It's my fault.
I knew it was dangerous.

530
00:24:55,661 --> 00:24:57,493
After he attacked me,

531
00:24:58,030 --> 00:25:00,021
I should've known
he was a psychotic,

532
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:02,768
and made sure
nothing happened to her.

533
00:25:02,835 --> 00:25:04,360
Now they got that
college class

534
00:25:04,436 --> 00:25:06,666
up there pawing
through all her stuff.

535
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:08,273
I can't believe
Captain Chapman

536
00:25:08,374 --> 00:25:09,535
is letting that happen.

537
00:25:09,608 --> 00:25:11,042
ZOOKIE: Chapman? You're
dealing with a real

538
00:25:11,143 --> 00:25:12,577
trifecta idiot there.

539
00:25:13,045 --> 00:25:14,945
Jim, we took up a collection,

540
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:17,512
and we want to hire you
to find out who killed Babs.

541
00:25:17,683 --> 00:25:18,912
There's $600.

542
00:25:19,852 --> 00:25:21,684
Trudy, I can't take that.

543
00:25:22,054 --> 00:25:23,180
Well, you have to.
I mean,

544
00:25:23,589 --> 00:25:25,182
well, you cared about her
like we did and,

545
00:25:25,324 --> 00:25:26,758
and to the cops
she's just gonna be

546
00:25:26,825 --> 00:25:28,259
some waitress
who got killed.

547
00:25:28,327 --> 00:25:29,726
A statistic.

548
00:25:30,329 --> 00:25:31,490
You loved her like we did.

549
00:25:31,897 --> 00:25:33,262
I can't take money for it.

550
00:25:33,665 --> 00:25:35,497
No, if you want,
you can kick in, too.

551
00:25:35,567 --> 00:25:37,399
But, you know,
we want to pay you.

552
00:25:37,636 --> 00:25:38,933
If we don't,

553
00:25:39,671 --> 00:25:41,298
it just won't feel
like we're doin' anything.

554
00:25:42,241 --> 00:25:43,231
Count me in.

555
00:25:44,243 --> 00:25:45,233
ZOOKIE:
Well, how about you, Leon?

556
00:25:45,477 --> 00:25:46,467
How about me what?

557
00:25:46,912 --> 00:25:49,506
We're hirin' Jim to find
out who killed Babs.

558
00:25:49,748 --> 00:25:50,738
Oh.

559
00:25:53,018 --> 00:25:55,919
Everybody's sad
about Babs now, hmm?

560
00:25:57,222 --> 00:26:00,317
Well, where were you guys
when she really needed you?

561
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,920
When she was tr yin' to put
Cal through college?

562
00:26:04,797 --> 00:26:06,458
Where were you guys
when she was workin'

563
00:26:06,532 --> 00:26:08,591
double shifts
and that poor boy

564
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:12,159
was hashin' all night,
paintin' houses and gardenin'

565
00:26:12,371 --> 00:26:13,964
just to make the tuition?

566
00:26:14,373 --> 00:26:16,205
Now he's dead,
she's dead.

567
00:26:16,442 --> 00:26:17,432
They can't use your money,

568
00:26:17,509 --> 00:26:19,534
and you're takin' up
a damn collection.

569
00:26:22,114 --> 00:26:24,014
You people amaze me.

570
00:26:27,853 --> 00:26:30,447
Ah, he don't mean it,
he don't.

571
00:26:30,856 --> 00:26:31,846
It's just his way.

572
00:26:31,924 --> 00:26:35,087
He's hurtin' just
like the rest of us.

573
00:26:35,694 --> 00:26:37,355
Uh, Jim, what are you
gonna do?

574
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:38,555
Where are you gonna start?

575
00:26:39,031 --> 00:26:41,523
Well, I got some stuff to do
around here, and then

576
00:26:42,868 --> 00:26:45,360
I guess I'll go up and take
another look at her house.

577
00:26:46,038 --> 00:26:47,028
God bless you, Jim.

578
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:50,041
ALL: Thanks, Jim.
Thanks. Go get 'em.

579
00:26:50,109 --> 00:26:51,474
I will.

580
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:56,270
CRITCH: Babs' is the first
locker on the left there, Jim.

581
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:57,711
Thanks for the key, CRITCH.

582
00:26:57,783 --> 00:26:59,376
I'll just be a minute.

583
00:26:59,651 --> 00:27:01,779
CRITCH: Let yourself out
when you're done.

584
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:25,299
BABS: Dear Diary,

585
00:27:25,577 --> 00:27:26,669
June has come
and I feel like

586
00:27:26,745 --> 00:27:28,577
my life has turned around.

587
00:27:28,847 --> 00:27:30,679
I have so much
to be thankful for.

588
00:27:31,083 --> 00:27:32,380
I have my boys.

589
00:27:32,784 --> 00:27:34,775
Corey's in rehab,
and I'm praying for him.

590
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,714
Cal got into Southwest
California University.

591
00:27:38,457 --> 00:27:40,221
Somehow, we'll scrape
up the tuition.

592
00:27:40,726 --> 00:27:43,127
Everybody at the Sand Castle
is so wonderful.

593
00:27:43,529 --> 00:27:45,190
I feel their love
and support.

594
00:27:45,797 --> 00:27:48,027
Nobody deserves such
wonderful friends.

595
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:49,862
{ know 'm blessed.

596
00:27:59,811 --> 00:28:01,404
(HORN HONKING)

597
00:28:19,431 --> 00:28:21,559
Hey, Rockford,
what are you doin' here?

598
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,063
Hi, Pete.

599
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,835
No air conditioning.

600
00:28:30,309 --> 00:28:31,743
It's hot as hell
in that bathroom.

601
00:28:32,077 --> 00:28:34,102
I had to pry open the window
just to get some air.

602
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:35,403
TRISH: Mr. Rockford.

603
00:28:36,281 --> 00:28:37,715
Good place for a picnic.

604
00:28:38,217 --> 00:28:40,208
I'm very sorry
about your friend.

605
00:28:40,752 --> 00:28:42,151
I can tell.

606
00:28:42,454 --> 00:28:43,444
Mr. Rockford,

607
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:45,656
did you have a relationship
with the deceased?

608
00:28:46,692 --> 00:28:48,023
I hope you plan
on picking up

609
00:28:48,093 --> 00:28:49,424
all your trash
before you leave.

610
00:28:49,861 --> 00:28:52,421
Mr. Rockford.
I know how this looks.

611
00:28:53,131 --> 00:28:54,929
I'm a trained
criminal behaviorist.

612
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,264
I've worked with several
police departments.

613
00:28:57,569 --> 00:28:59,264
Then you know these kids
shouldn't be here.

614
00:28:59,471 --> 00:29:01,439
(SIGHS)
I know. I know.

615
00:29:01,506 --> 00:29:03,565
The Dean gave control
of my class this semester

616
00:29:03,642 --> 00:29:05,872
to Captain Chapman,
and for some reason

617
00:29:06,111 --> 00:29:07,101
he seems to think
that this is an

618
00:29:07,179 --> 00:29:08,669
important field experience.

619
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:11,147
Excuse me, will you?

620
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:13,541
Look, Mr. Keats,
will you stay out of the house

621
00:29:13,652 --> 00:29:15,245
till the forensic team
gets out of there?

622
00:29:15,454 --> 00:29:17,252
They're wasting their time.
It's a follow-home robbery

623
00:29:17,322 --> 00:29:19,416
turned into murder. The crime
did not happen in the bedroom.

624
00:29:19,725 --> 00:29:21,284
Follow-home robbery?
Weren't you the one who said

625
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,850
it was a crime of passion?

626
00:29:22,961 --> 00:29:24,190
No. That was me.

627
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:26,789
Well, it's no
follow-home robbery, okay?

628
00:29:26,965 --> 00:29:28,831
Now, stay out of there
till the crime tapes are down.

629
00:29:29,067 --> 00:29:30,262
Well, if this is not
a follow-home,

630
00:29:30,335 --> 00:29:32,201
then I'd like very much to
hear you defend your theory,

631
00:29:32,271 --> 00:29:33,261
Captain MacEnroe.

632
00:29:33,505 --> 00:29:34,904
ROCKFORD:
Uh, let me, Captain.

633
00:29:35,407 --> 00:29:38,035
Follow-home robberies are
generally targeted on people

634
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:39,737
who drive expensive cars.

635
00:29:39,978 --> 00:29:43,414
You follow a 560 Mercedes
or a Ferrari.

636
00:29:43,882 --> 00:29:45,372
Only a drooling fool
would follow home

637
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:46,918
a rusted out,
10-year-old clunker.

638
00:29:50,922 --> 00:29:52,412
Jim, get outta here.
Chapman sees you,

639
00:29:52,491 --> 00:29:53,481
he's gonna go ballistic.

640
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:54,717
Hey, what's all that?

641
00:29:54,826 --> 00:29:57,056
I gotta grade these for
Chapman by 10:00 tomorrow.

642
00:29:57,129 --> 00:29:58,392
You gotta what?

643
00:29:58,463 --> 00:30:00,522
Let it be, okay?
Just get outta here.

644
00:30:00,599 --> 00:30:02,067
Dennis, have you got anything?

645
00:30:02,134 --> 00:30:03,499
There's not too much here.

646
00:30:03,769 --> 00:30:05,965
That's because it was
a professional hit.

647
00:30:06,305 --> 00:30:07,466
I told you what happened.

648
00:30:07,606 --> 00:30:09,768
She's been parking out in
front of Hap Cortello's house,

649
00:30:09,941 --> 00:30:11,272
following him around
for a month.

650
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:14,142
He could have thought she
witnessed one of his crooked deals,

651
00:30:14,212 --> 00:30:15,202
came up here,
and killed her.

652
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,970
That's not the way
Chapman sees it.

653
00:30:17,215 --> 00:30:18,842
Oh, look at that.
Look at that!

654
00:30:19,151 --> 00:30:21,119
I mean, that fat kid
out there drops this,

655
00:30:21,186 --> 00:30:23,245
and now it's evidence. You
better get these kids out of here.

656
00:30:23,322 --> 00:30:25,416
They're contaminating
your crime scene.

657
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:28,084
CHAPMAN: What the hell
are you doing, Rockford?

658
00:30:28,427 --> 00:30:31,397
Becker, what is he doing?
What the hell is he doing?

659
00:30:35,467 --> 00:30:37,162
Get me a blue out here,
right now.

660
00:30:37,302 --> 00:30:38,827
DETECTIVE: Yes, sir. Captain,
the lab people marked

661
00:30:38,904 --> 00:30:41,566
one of those candy wrappers
that one of your class dropped.

662
00:30:41,807 --> 00:30:44,799
Well, if they marked it,
then it's evidence.

663
00:30:45,243 --> 00:30:46,472
This is a crime scene.

664
00:30:46,611 --> 00:30:48,306
I don't want civilians
in my crime scene.

665
00:30:48,447 --> 00:30:50,211
Not unless they have
a student body card.

666
00:30:50,782 --> 00:30:53,149
I don't need wise-ass
remarks from you, Rockford.

667
00:30:53,385 --> 00:30:55,080
You'd be well advised
to listen to these kids.

668
00:30:55,153 --> 00:30:56,348
They've studied criminology,

669
00:30:56,421 --> 00:30:58,048
which, to my knowledge,
you haven't.

670
00:30:58,123 --> 00:30:59,488
They've got lots
of good ideas.

671
00:30:59,558 --> 00:31:01,617
ROCKFORD: Please.
I can't take much more.

672
00:31:01,993 --> 00:31:03,893
It just so happens
that Keats' theory

673
00:31:03,995 --> 00:31:05,986
that this was a crime
of opportunity

674
00:31:06,064 --> 00:31:08,533
and she didn't know her
killer is proving itself out.

675
00:31:08,667 --> 00:31:09,930
There was a forced entry,

676
00:31:10,001 --> 00:31:12,026
and forced entry means
she didn't know her assailant.

677
00:31:12,137 --> 00:31:14,367
Let me guess.
The bathroom window?

678
00:31:14,973 --> 00:31:15,963
How the hell
did you know that?

679
00:31:16,174 --> 00:31:17,573
The Pillsbury Doughboy
out front?

680
00:31:17,642 --> 00:31:19,269
The one that dropped
a candy wrapper.

681
00:31:19,745 --> 00:31:21,474
He opened it 'cause
he got hot.

682
00:31:22,314 --> 00:31:23,304
Go on, ask him.

683
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:25,205
This was no crime
of opportunity,

684
00:31:25,283 --> 00:31:27,718
it was premeditated,
first degree murder.

685
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,849
She knew her killer,
Hap Cortello.

686
00:31:29,955 --> 00:31:31,616
She'd been following him
around for over a month.

687
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:33,918
Pete, arrest him.
What...

688
00:31:34,025 --> 00:31:35,083
You got a charge?

689
00:31:35,227 --> 00:31:36,956
How about tampering
with evidence,

690
00:31:37,028 --> 00:31:39,122
interfering with a homicide
investigation?

691
00:31:39,197 --> 00:31:40,221
That's just for starters.

692
00:31:40,298 --> 00:31:43,097
Oh, and I might even add
suspicion of murder.

693
00:31:43,301 --> 00:31:44,894
Chapman...

694
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:46,360
BECKER: Suspicion of murder?

695
00:31:46,438 --> 00:31:48,065
You better get yourself
an attorney, Jim.

696
00:31:59,351 --> 00:32:00,648
Now let me
get this straight.

697
00:32:00,852 --> 00:32:03,253
You're holding him for
contaminating a crime scene,

698
00:32:03,321 --> 00:32:04,482
while at the same time

699
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:06,318
you lead a class
full of college students

700
00:32:06,391 --> 00:32:07,916
through the very
same location?

701
00:32:07,993 --> 00:32:09,222
You don't really want
to read about that

702
00:32:09,294 --> 00:32:10,625
in tomorrow's paper,
do you, Captain?

703
00:32:10,729 --> 00:32:11,924
God, how I used to hate it

704
00:32:11,997 --> 00:32:13,089
when you were
doing criminal law.

705
00:32:13,165 --> 00:32:15,634
I thought you were out
writing trashy novels now.

706
00:32:15,834 --> 00:32:17,962
Captain, I'll always be here
to drop a flag on you.

707
00:32:18,136 --> 00:32:19,797
My California Bar
license is current,

708
00:32:19,905 --> 00:32:21,737
so let me fix you
a reality cocktail.

709
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,030
You keep this up,

710
00:32:23,208 --> 00:32:25,176
you're gonna end up lookin'
like Captain Kangaroo.

711
00:32:25,577 --> 00:32:27,602
(LAUGHS)
Okay, Van Zandt,

712
00:32:27,846 --> 00:32:28,938
you can have him back.

713
00:32:29,047 --> 00:32:30,071
But here's the deal.

714
00:32:30,916 --> 00:32:32,748
He's still a suspect
in this murder.

715
00:32:32,818 --> 00:32:34,286
Wanna bet?
And if I catch him

716
00:32:34,352 --> 00:32:36,946
in an unauthorized attempt
to mess with this case,

717
00:32:37,055 --> 00:32:38,716
I'll drop-kick him into orbit.

718
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:39,848
I'll pass it along.

719
00:32:39,925 --> 00:32:40,949
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no.

720
00:32:41,126 --> 00:32:42,651
Make him believe it.

721
00:32:43,528 --> 00:32:44,927
I'm gonna cut him loose.

722
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:46,789
So get him outta here.

723
00:32:51,503 --> 00:32:54,029
ROCKFORD: Well, thanks, Beth.

724
00:32:54,439 --> 00:32:56,533
Take that out of your mouth,
Jim, and listen to me.

725
00:32:56,875 --> 00:32:58,001
I know what he said.

726
00:32:58,076 --> 00:32:59,840
It's the same thing
he always says.

727
00:33:00,111 --> 00:33:02,512
He's gonna jack me
if I don't get lost, right?

728
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:05,442
"Drop-kick you into orbit"
was the exact expression.

729
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:06,847
Chapman couldn't drop-kick

730
00:33:06,918 --> 00:33:09,216
a beach ball into a playpen.

731
00:33:09,554 --> 00:33:10,749
I can handle him, don't worry.

732
00:33:10,856 --> 00:33:11,948
Jim, listen to me.

733
00:33:12,023 --> 00:33:13,821
You could be looking
at 10 years.

734
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:15,118
You're underestimating
Chapman.

735
00:33:15,193 --> 00:33:17,127
He's gonna get you
if you don't lay off.

736
00:33:17,329 --> 00:33:19,593
If he gets me,
you'll get me out.

737
00:33:19,731 --> 00:33:21,631
That's the criminal
justice line dance.

738
00:33:22,167 --> 00:33:24,499
Everybody gets to walk in LA.

739
00:33:27,372 --> 00:33:29,101
Eat lots of Twinkies, Jim.

740
00:33:32,644 --> 00:33:34,738
BABS: Sometimes life
is such a struggle.

741
00:33:35,447 --> 00:33:38,508
It's as if God was passing me
through the fire to forge me.

742
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:41,075
Corey just can't seem
to get it right.

743
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:44,615
Ten hours out of rehab
he got busted again.

744
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:47,249
His friends are such
grease stains.

745
00:33:47,659 --> 00:33:49,991
Why can't he see
what he's doing to himself?

746
00:33:50,295 --> 00:33:52,263
At least Cal
still hums along.

747
00:33:52,631 --> 00:33:54,224
He got a job painting houses.

748
00:33:54,599 --> 00:33:57,159
On a sweet note,
Jim Rockford was in today.

749
00:33:57,502 --> 00:33:59,698
He's been gone out
of town on business.

750
00:33:59,905 --> 00:34:02,237
It was good to see
his smiling face.

751
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:05,070
If my boys could end up
being like him,

752
00:34:05,844 --> 00:34:07,903
I'd feel I'd done my job.

753
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,881
I just wish he was
a better tipper.

754
00:34:23,862 --> 00:34:25,728
ROCKFORD: Well, you must have
my transcript.

755
00:34:25,864 --> 00:34:27,798
I want to re-enroll
in the college.

756
00:34:28,233 --> 00:34:30,827
I had three units in
'89 fall semester.

757
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:32,427
I took a golfing class.

758
00:34:33,305 --> 00:34:35,569
Another true seeker
of knowledge.

759
00:34:37,509 --> 00:34:38,840
Did you ever get rid
of that slice?

760
00:34:40,145 --> 00:34:42,136
I like to refer
to it as a fade.

761
00:34:44,049 --> 00:34:45,039
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

762
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:46,445
TRISH: Yeah?

763
00:34:47,953 --> 00:34:48,943
ROCKFORD: Hi.

764
00:34:50,188 --> 00:34:51,178
What do you want?

765
00:34:51,823 --> 00:34:53,222
I want to sign up
for your class.

766
00:34:53,592 --> 00:34:54,582
Sorry.

767
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:56,058
You've got to be a student
at this university

768
00:34:56,127 --> 00:34:57,561
with a transcript and at least

769
00:34:57,629 --> 00:34:59,893
one preliminary course
in this field of study.

770
00:35:01,967 --> 00:35:03,298
(SCOFFS)

771
00:35:03,368 --> 00:35:04,802
You're kidding me, right?

772
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:06,833
I teach Criminal Science.

773
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:08,804
How is Introductory Golf
a prerequisite?

774
00:35:10,175 --> 00:35:11,609
Uh, both courses are about

775
00:35:11,676 --> 00:35:13,701
hitting defenseless
objects with clubs.

776
00:35:16,348 --> 00:35:18,112
Look, I'm, I'm sorry

777
00:35:18,183 --> 00:35:21,016
I came on so strong at the
funeral park and at Babs' house.

778
00:35:21,086 --> 00:35:23,350
I, I was upset.

779
00:35:24,289 --> 00:35:25,882
She was a close friend, and I

780
00:35:26,458 --> 00:35:27,653
feel guilty about her death.

781
00:35:27,726 --> 00:35:29,057
I was a little emotional.

782
00:35:31,329 --> 00:35:33,229
And you were right.
We shouldn't have been there.

783
00:35:35,533 --> 00:35:38,195
I need to get into
your class, Dr. George.

784
00:35:40,038 --> 00:35:42,268
Captain Chapman
isn't fond of you.

785
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:44,798
You see? Already
a character reference.

786
00:35:46,745 --> 00:35:48,440
I don't like him either.
He's a jerk.

787
00:35:50,015 --> 00:35:51,744
Yeah, I, uh,

788
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:53,941
I picked up
the Registrar's slip,

789
00:35:54,085 --> 00:35:56,144
and she said that I had

790
00:35:56,221 --> 00:35:58,451
to get your approval
to start the class late.

791
00:35:58,923 --> 00:36:00,789
I also got the reading list,

792
00:36:00,892 --> 00:36:02,451
a new binder
at the student store,

793
00:36:02,527 --> 00:36:03,926
and all I need
is your signature

794
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:05,656
and a student parking pass.

795
00:36:09,334 --> 00:36:11,359
Now, what we have here

796
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:14,495
are the five "W's."

797
00:36:14,939 --> 00:36:16,703
Now, we know where
she was killed.

798
00:36:16,941 --> 00:36:17,931
In the bedroom.

799
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:19,166
What was she killed with?

800
00:36:19,744 --> 00:36:21,542
.22 caliber bullet.

801
00:36:21,713 --> 00:36:22,703
When she died.

802
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:25,441
According to the liver
temperature test,

803
00:36:25,717 --> 00:36:29,176
<i>she died at 12:45 am.</i>

804
00:36:30,321 --> 00:36:34,155
Now, that leaves
"Why" and "Who."

805
00:36:34,893 --> 00:36:36,361
Let's take a whack at this,
what do you say?

806
00:36:36,628 --> 00:36:39,256
Suspects? Anyone? Hands.

807
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:40,354
Ms. Clark.

808
00:36:40,432 --> 00:36:41,763
CANDACE:
I met this guy at the funeral.

809
00:36:42,067 --> 00:36:43,899
His name is Corey Honeywell.

810
00:36:44,069 --> 00:36:45,230
He's the dead woman's son.

811
00:36:45,303 --> 00:36:46,634
That guy is so fly.

812
00:36:46,771 --> 00:36:47,761
He couldn't have done it.

813
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:50,674
He has a record for dealing
drugs and petty theft,

814
00:36:51,242 --> 00:36:53,267
and I was just thinkin' him
for one of the "Whos,"

815
00:36:53,344 --> 00:36:55,142
or maybe it was
a bad drug deal.

816
00:36:55,313 --> 00:36:57,008
CHAPMAN: Mmm-hmm.
He killed his mom by mistake,

817
00:36:57,248 --> 00:36:58,238
for under "Why."

818
00:36:58,316 --> 00:37:00,808
CHAPMAN:
Anyone else? Hands, please.

819
00:37:01,019 --> 00:37:03,215
This guy Rockford is way
into the margin for me.

820
00:37:03,488 --> 00:37:04,546
I mean, he says he's up there

821
00:37:04,622 --> 00:37:06,090
because he wants
to tell her that

822
00:37:06,391 --> 00:37:08,723
he's not going to file
some criminal charge

823
00:37:08,793 --> 00:37:09,988
against some guy,

824
00:37:10,261 --> 00:37:11,854
and lo and behold
he finds the body?

825
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:15,423
This is good thinking.

826
00:37:15,633 --> 00:37:16,623
I like this.

827
00:37:16,768 --> 00:37:18,736
Now,
carry it a little further if you can.

828
00:37:19,137 --> 00:37:22,573
I think he's our classic
not-very-smart criminal,

829
00:37:22,674 --> 00:37:23,903
returning to the crime scene.

830
00:37:24,109 --> 00:37:25,099
And who is this guy?

831
00:37:25,343 --> 00:37:27,402
He's certainly not
an upstanding citizen.

832
00:37:27,579 --> 00:37:28,910
He's got a prison record.

833
00:37:29,047 --> 00:37:30,640
ROCKFORD:
I was cleared, sonny.

834
00:37:35,553 --> 00:37:37,544
Unless a pardon
in the State of California

835
00:37:37,622 --> 00:37:39,021
doesn't mean
anything any more.

836
00:37:39,491 --> 00:37:40,686
Get out, Rockford.

837
00:37:41,659 --> 00:37:44,060
This is a university lab.
We don't allow audits.

838
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:46,697
You want some really horrible
news, Captain Chapman?

839
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:49,161
I am registered.
I am a full-fledged,

840
00:37:49,334 --> 00:37:50,961
student body
card-carrying heckler.

841
00:37:51,035 --> 00:37:53,129
No, you're not.
You're outta here.

842
00:37:53,638 --> 00:37:55,402
I don't have you
on my reg list.

843
00:37:55,874 --> 00:37:57,535
Well, you must have
the old list.

844
00:37:57,742 --> 00:37:58,732
I paid my tuition.

845
00:37:58,843 --> 00:38:01,244
I was accepted into
the class by Dr. George.

846
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:03,779
I signed him in.

847
00:38:04,015 --> 00:38:06,279
I filed it with the Registrar.
I didn't think you'd mind.

848
00:38:06,351 --> 00:38:07,978
You said the more
the merrier.

849
00:38:08,052 --> 00:38:10,987
And believe me,
I intend to keep it merry.

850
00:38:11,222 --> 00:38:13,554
Now, back on our merry way
up there under "Who,"

851
00:38:13,625 --> 00:38:15,320
you might want to add
an LA gangster

852
00:38:15,393 --> 00:38:17,157
by the name
of Joseph Cortello,

853
00:38:17,328 --> 00:38:19,194
aka Happy Cortello.

854
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:21,425
Hap dresses up
any suspect list.

855
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:22,828
Joseph Cortello.

856
00:38:23,001 --> 00:38:24,298
He was the guy who killed
those two people

857
00:38:24,369 --> 00:38:25,700
with a baling hook
last year.

858
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:27,269
He got off on
some technicality.

859
00:38:27,338 --> 00:38:28,601
ROCKFORD: Yeah, the very same.

860
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:30,606
Now, let's see,
up there under "Why,"

861
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:33,175
does it bother anybody at all

862
00:38:33,378 --> 00:38:36,245
that Babs Honeywell's
22-year-old son Cal

863
00:38:36,381 --> 00:38:38,179
was a homicide victim
18 months ago?

864
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:39,681
That's another case.

865
00:38:39,818 --> 00:38:41,115
Well, I don't think it is.

866
00:38:41,653 --> 00:38:42,814
You know, I don't know
about all of you,

867
00:38:42,921 --> 00:38:46,084
but I think it's kind of loose
for a bunch of college students

868
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:47,989
to be messing
around on a case

869
00:38:48,059 --> 00:38:50,027
where two closely
related people

870
00:38:50,094 --> 00:38:51,528
have died in two years

871
00:38:51,596 --> 00:38:54,190
and Joe Cortello
is in any way involved.

872
00:38:54,632 --> 00:38:56,430
But it's a
follow-home killing.

873
00:38:56,701 --> 00:38:59,602
This killing was not done
by some zooted-up junkie.

874
00:38:59,838 --> 00:39:01,806
It was a premeditated
homicide.

875
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:04,973
It was committed by
a top-shelf psychopath,

876
00:39:05,043 --> 00:39:06,204
and if I were you guys,

877
00:39:06,311 --> 00:39:07,506
I think I'd pick a case

878
00:39:07,579 --> 00:39:09,946
where the suspects
don't eliminate witnesses.

879
00:39:10,248 --> 00:39:11,841
I don't want to get killed
in this course.

880
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:14,379
All right, all right. Now,
wait a minute, wait a minute,

881
00:39:14,452 --> 00:39:16,978
wait a minute. Let me make
something very clear here.

882
00:39:18,089 --> 00:39:20,148
This class was
assigned to study

883
00:39:20,225 --> 00:39:23,160
every aspect of the
Honeywell murder,

884
00:39:23,428 --> 00:39:25,453
and they're damn well
gonna do it.

886
00:39:27,932 --> 00:39:30,526
Class dismissed.
And stay low.

887
00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:33,160
Outside.

888
00:39:33,271 --> 00:39:34,568
I don't want
to niggle and whine,

889
00:39:34,639 --> 00:39:36,300
but isn't there some
sort of conduct code

890
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:38,968
that's supposed to exist
between a student and teacher?

891
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:41,671
You need a prerequisite
course for this class.

892
00:39:41,746 --> 00:39:44,010
I got one. I've been
accepted by the Registrar.

893
00:39:44,182 --> 00:39:45,877
But if that's not enough,

894
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:47,975
1, uh, took advanced
criminal courses

895
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:50,077
in Sweet Potato
Gardening and, uh,

896
00:39:50,188 --> 00:39:51,451
Shower Stall Combat
at Quentin.

897
00:39:51,556 --> 00:39:53,046
Now, those credits
should transfer.

898
00:39:53,324 --> 00:39:55,053
You want to get in
this class, huh, Rockford?

899
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:56,750
Why? For what
possible reason?

900
00:39:56,995 --> 00:39:58,520
I missed the circus this year.

901
00:39:58,730 --> 00:39:59,720
Uh-huh.

902
00:40:00,999 --> 00:40:02,694
Okay, I can live with that.

903
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,928
But, uh, you enrolled
two weeks late,

904
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:07,968
so I'm gonna need a
30-page make-up paper

905
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:10,166
day after tomorrow on,
uh, lemme see, uh,

906
00:40:10,308 --> 00:40:12,299
oh, how about "The Collection
and Preservation

907
00:40:12,377 --> 00:40:14,436
"of Physical Evidence
in a Homicide"?

908
00:40:14,979 --> 00:40:15,969
The what?

909
00:40:16,214 --> 00:40:18,046
I want you to pay
particular attention

910
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:21,716
to latent fingerprinting,
selection, shipment,

911
00:40:21,819 --> 00:40:23,685
as well as proper
evidence packaging.

912
00:40:23,988 --> 00:40:26,582
I mean, you just so much
as miss one section,

913
00:40:26,791 --> 00:40:29,488
I'm gonna come down
on you like a concrete wall.

914
00:40:29,794 --> 00:40:31,523
Then I'm gonna remove
you from this class

915
00:40:31,596 --> 00:40:33,360
for failure to perform.

916
00:40:33,998 --> 00:40:35,193
I've had that
complaint before,

917
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:36,392
but never from a guy.

918
00:40:37,068 --> 00:40:38,695
Uh, Shipment
and, and what?

919
00:40:38,903 --> 00:40:40,632
Oh, when you make up
the paper,

920
00:40:40,705 --> 00:40:42,935
use a bibliography
and proper footnotes,

921
00:40:43,074 --> 00:40:44,064
one-inch margins.

922
00:40:44,208 --> 00:40:45,403
Neatness counts.

Hi.

925
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:54,976
That was some dust-up
you had in class.

926
00:40:55,219 --> 00:40:57,779
Ah, well, Chapman
and I have a bad history.

927
00:40:59,324 --> 00:41:00,621
I heard you have
to write a paper.

928
00:41:00,825 --> 00:41:02,384
Yeah, and neatness counts.

929
00:41:02,593 --> 00:41:04,118
All I can say for sure is,

930
00:41:04,195 --> 00:41:06,186
it's gonna be
a very neat paper.

931
00:41:07,699 --> 00:41:08,689
This ought to do it.

932
00:41:08,967 --> 00:41:10,765
Gotta get these back
to my trailer.

933
00:41:11,903 --> 00:41:14,065
Why are you so determined
to stay in this class?

934

CHAPMAN ON TAPE: This
class was assigned to study

935
00:41:19,577 --> 00:41:22,137
every aspect of the
Honeywell murder,

936
00:41:22,447 --> 00:41:24,711
and they're damn
well gonna do it.

937
00:41:25,049 --> 00:41:27,347
By insulting him,
I managed to finesse

938
00:41:27,418 --> 00:41:28,647
that statement
out of Chapman.

939
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,051
That's why I wanna
stay in your class.

940
00:41:30,888 --> 00:41:31,878
To study the murder.

941
00:41:32,290 --> 00:41:34,281
Jim Rockford,
the private investigator,

942
00:41:34,359 --> 00:41:37,124
has been told by Doug Chapman,
the police captain,

943
00:41:37,195 --> 00:41:39,095
to stay away from the
Honeywell murder case.

944
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:41,864
However, Jim Rockford,
the college student,

945
00:41:41,933 --> 00:41:44,994
has been assigned by Doug Chapman,
the college professor,

946
00:41:45,136 --> 00:41:47,104
to investigate
the very same case.

947
00:41:48,006 --> 00:41:50,202
I'm gonna prove that
Hap Cortello killed her.

948
00:41:50,608 --> 00:41:51,598
How?

949
00:41:52,076 --> 00:41:54,272
I need you to, uh, give me
a special assignment.

950
00:41:55,246 --> 00:41:56,236
A what?

951
00:41:56,681 --> 00:41:58,979
I need to be assigned
a field practicum

952
00:41:59,117 --> 00:42:02,781
to access and coordinate
some research material.

Yeah.

955

He's gonna break
into Babs' pad and toss it.

956
00:42:08,426 --> 00:42:09,416
Yeah.

957
00:42:11,162 --> 00:42:12,152
Okay.

958
00:42:13,231 --> 00:42:14,221
I want to go with you.

959

we just get Leon

961

goes for a 90% discount.

I'd sort of like to mine this
student-teacher thing we have happening.

1043
00:46:42,667 --> 00:46:46,126
Shut up. You're gonna eat some
felony paper on this, Rockford.

1044
00:46:46,270 --> 00:46:49,365
Obstructing justice,
interfering with evidence...

1045
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:51,568
I wouldn't have gone up there
if you hadn't asked me to.

1046
00:46:51,709 --> 00:46:53,302
I never asked you to.

1047
00:46:54,979 --> 00:46:58,279
CHAPMAN ON TAPE: This class
was assigned to study every aspect

1048
00:46:58,349 --> 00:47:01,649
of the Honeywell murder,
and they're damn well gonna do it!

1049
00:47:01,719 --> 00:47:03,687
Oh, yeah.
And you expect that to stick?

1050
00:47:04,555 --> 00:47:08,014
I assigned him to re-define your
motive and time-of-death theory.

1051
00:47:08,392 --> 00:47:09,621
I'm speechless.

1052
00:47:09,927 --> 00:47:11,520
It's a big improvement.

1053
00:47:12,229 --> 00:47:16,188
Re-define the motive? The
motive was profit. It's always profit.

1054
00:47:16,267 --> 00:47:18,361
Well, I don't wanna
contradict, Captain,

1055
00:47:18,436 --> 00:47:21,895
but besides profit there
are six other classic motives.

1056
00:47:21,972 --> 00:47:24,771
Jealousy, revenge,
to cover a crime,

1057
00:47:24,842 --> 00:47:28,745
to avoid humiliation or disgrace,
accidental homicide, and homicidal mania.

1058
00:47:28,913 --> 00:47:30,745
Any of this gonna be
on the final?

1059
00:47:30,815 --> 00:47:34,445
You're busted,
Jimbo. Do you mind if I call you Jimbo?

1060
00:47:34,552 --> 00:47:37,522
You know, this whole thing's not
gonna play well down at Parker Center.

1061
00:47:37,588 --> 00:47:39,852
You're hangin' way over
the fence here, Doug.

1062
00:47:39,924 --> 00:47:43,690
You've got your honor student
slinging lead at the class cut-up.

1063
00:47:43,761 --> 00:47:45,820
The whole lesson plan
may need a re-tool.

1064
00:47:46,464 --> 00:47:48,626
(LAUGHS)
Yeah, sure.

1065
00:48:04,482 --> 00:48:06,280
You really shouldn't
be leaving.

1066
00:48:06,350 --> 00:48:08,546
I mean, that wound could get
infected and we'd have to drain it.

1067
00:48:08,619 --> 00:48:11,520
Your sutures could pull.
I am leaving.

1068
00:48:11,622 --> 00:48:14,853
I stay in the hospital more than
a few days, I get a soft palate.

1069
00:48:14,925 --> 00:48:17,292
How are you gonna get home?
You can't drive.

1070
00:48:17,361 --> 00:48:20,194
Schaefer Transport Service
here to transport James Rockford.

1071
00:48:20,398 --> 00:48:24,028
Well, you guys got great timing,
but I didn't order an ambulance.

1072
00:48:24,402 --> 00:48:26,496
Uh, you know a Trish George?

1073
00:48:26,804 --> 00:48:29,603
Well, she shouldn't be wasting
her money on an ambulance.

1074
00:48:29,673 --> 00:48:31,835
Well, she's already done it.
Paid in advance.

1075
00:48:32,510 --> 00:48:34,000
Want the ride, or not?

1076
00:48:35,312 --> 00:48:38,213
Oh, I guess. Yeah, let's go.

1077
00:48:46,056 --> 00:48:47,490
We've been traveling
along time.

1078
00:48:47,558 --> 00:48:49,822
You sure you guys know
where you're goin'?

1079
00:48:49,894 --> 00:48:51,487
We're almost
to Malibu Hills now.

1080
00:48:52,296 --> 00:48:57,097
There's the bug in the clam
sauce. I don't live in Malibu Hills.

1081
00:48:57,268 --> 00:49:01,205
Sorry. Malibu Hills is the delivery
point I've been contracted for.

1082
00:49:01,405 --> 00:49:03,169
I'm rewriting the contract.

1083
00:49:04,008 --> 00:49:05,669
Hey, just take it easy,
Mr. Rockford.

1084
00:49:07,344 --> 00:49:08,709
Or what?

1085
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:11,311
Or nothing.

1086
00:49:12,783 --> 00:49:14,877
Just don't make this
into a situation.

1087
00:49:14,952 --> 00:49:16,784
Let me guess.

1088
00:49:16,854 --> 00:49:18,845
You guys work
for Hap Cortello.

1089
00:49:26,730 --> 00:49:28,425
MAN: Go give 'em a hand.

1090
00:49:44,014 --> 00:49:47,917
Whoa, whoa,
whoa! I'm a foot wide and a mile tall.

1091
00:49:47,985 --> 00:49:50,545
Either give me the chair
or yell "timber."

1092
00:49:51,288 --> 00:49:52,687
Ohh...

1093
00:49:55,826 --> 00:49:57,385
And, up.

1094
00:50:06,303 --> 00:50:07,828
So we'll wait if you want.

1095
00:50:07,905 --> 00:50:10,704
Please. Somebody should
see to the remains.

1096
00:50:14,512 --> 00:50:18,540
Ramone. Ramone, listen.
Try, uh...

1097
00:50:18,649 --> 00:50:21,380
Try OceanView Drugs,
all right?

1098
00:50:21,452 --> 00:50:23,614
They're closer.
Right away, Mr. Cortello.

1099
00:50:23,687 --> 00:50:26,486
I think I'll beg off. I've had
plenty of drugs for a while.

1100
00:50:26,590 --> 00:50:30,993
Huh? What's the matter
with you, huh?

1101
00:50:31,061 --> 00:50:33,587
I'm not gonna hurt you.

1102
00:50:35,065 --> 00:50:37,932
I want you to be my guest
for lunch.

1103
00:50:38,002 --> 00:50:41,495
Ha! I ordered out for,
uh, sushi.

1104
00:50:41,605 --> 00:50:43,630
You love it? (LAUGHS)

1105
00:50:43,707 --> 00:50:46,369
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Ramone! Uh...

1106
00:50:47,044 --> 00:50:53,040
Have Dr. Klinburg phone the guys
at the drugstore. I need that now!

1107
00:50:53,117 --> 00:50:54,812
You got it.
Go, will you!

1108
00:50:56,954 --> 00:50:59,480
Sinuses? Allergies? Flu?

1109
00:50:59,590 --> 00:51:04,391
Ah, I got, uh, I got what they call,
uh, bipolar illness.

1110
00:51:04,495 --> 00:51:07,021
That's what they call it now,
bipolar illness.

1111
00:51:07,097 --> 00:51:09,122
It don't sound
so bad that way.

1112
00:51:09,233 --> 00:51:10,462
Sorry to hear it.

1113
00:51:10,534 --> 00:51:13,060
Yeah, they used to call it
manic-depressive.

1114
00:51:13,137 --> 00:51:16,163
Now, they call it
bipolar.

1115
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:18,902
Sometimes, when I don't
have my Lithium, uh,

1116
00:51:19,376 --> 00:51:20,605
I blow off the needle

1117
00:51:20,678 --> 00:51:22,407
and kick the crap
outta somebody.

1118
00:51:24,315 --> 00:51:26,716
Not to be prying, but, uh,

1119
00:51:26,784 --> 00:51:29,151
is that what you're out of?
What Ramone is after?

1120
00:51:30,321 --> 00:51:31,584
Yeah.

1121
00:51:34,058 --> 00:51:35,685
I thought I had some
in the pool house,

1122
00:51:35,759 --> 00:51:39,286
but my wife must have taken it
out the last time she was there.

1123
00:51:39,363 --> 00:51:41,957
You know, we're not, uh,
entirely moved in.

1124
00:51:42,032 --> 00:51:45,229
The way these contractors are goin',
we ain't never gonna finish.

1125
00:51:45,302 --> 00:51:48,135
You can borrow my ambulance if
you want! It might speed things up!

1126
00:51:48,205 --> 00:51:50,401
Thanks, but I've got a car.

1127
00:51:50,474 --> 00:51:53,171
Go, will you! Now!

1128
00:51:53,243 --> 00:51:56,679
Look, Mr. Rockford. Jim.

1129
00:51:58,182 --> 00:52:00,549
I'd like to apologize for
what happened the other night.

1130
00:52:00,618 --> 00:52:03,246
And I wanna make it up to you,
because... Oh, that's not necessary.

1131
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:06,381
You probably just needed
your Lithium.

1132
00:52:06,523 --> 00:52:10,482
Will you shut up and listen!

1133
00:52:10,561 --> 00:52:14,896
Okay? I'm trying to have a
civil conversation here with you!

1134
00:52:14,965 --> 00:52:19,266
Why do you keep interrupting me,
damn it? I'm trying to say I'm sorry!

1135
00:52:19,336 --> 00:52:22,533
Look, you're gonna have to excuse me. Uh,
I'm not well.

1136
00:52:22,606 --> 00:52:26,975
I've lost a lot of blood lately, and what
I've got left would launch a SAM missile.

1137
00:52:27,211 --> 00:52:31,273
Yeah, this woman. Babs?

1138
00:52:31,348 --> 00:52:35,410
She thought I killed her kid.
I liked him!

1139
00:52:35,486 --> 00:52:38,820
He was painting my pool house.
Why would I kill him?

1140
00:52:39,323 --> 00:52:41,485
Well, no kidding.
Why, indeed?

1141
00:52:41,925 --> 00:52:46,362
I have a very good alibi.

1142
00:52:47,665 --> 00:52:51,863
I was at a church fundraiser
with a cardinal.

1143
00:52:52,202 --> 00:52:54,796
You probably read that
in the police report.

1144
00:52:56,073 --> 00:53:01,671
I mean, you ever even
know a cardinal?

1145
00:53:04,581 --> 00:53:06,675
I knew a couple
of Dodgers once.

1146
00:53:07,117 --> 00:53:09,643
You makin' fun of me?
No.

1147
00:53:10,287 --> 00:53:12,688
No, I'm just trying
to get the picture.

1148
00:53:12,756 --> 00:53:15,691
You paid for an ambulance to
bring me up here so you could tell me

1149
00:53:15,759 --> 00:53:18,091
that you didn't kill Cal
and his mother, is that it?

1150
00:53:18,162 --> 00:53:20,790
Quit that, huh?
What, what, what?

1151
00:53:20,864 --> 00:53:23,925
Putting words in my mouth!
I hate that!

1152
00:53:24,268 --> 00:53:26,896
Well, okay. Okay.

1153
00:53:27,037 --> 00:53:28,971
Hey, what?... Wha...

1154
00:53:29,239 --> 00:53:31,867
Ahh!

1155
00:53:32,843 --> 00:53:36,040
Ah, well.
Well, here we are.

1156
00:53:36,113 --> 00:53:39,105
Yeah. Kind of hot
for this time of year.

1157
00:53:39,183 --> 00:53:42,585
You know, usually it doesn't
get this oppressive until mid-July,

1158
00:53:42,653 --> 00:53:46,351
you know, except for a little breeze,
and... I'm tr yin' to say I'm sorry.

1159
00:53:47,291 --> 00:53:52,821
I, I, I want to apologize to you for
kickin' the crap out of you. So why

1160
00:53:53,664 --> 00:53:55,291
are you makin' me
so damn mad?

1161
00:53:55,933 --> 00:53:57,560
NICKY: I can't find it, boss!

1162
00:53:57,634 --> 00:54:00,660
Try, uh, the master bath
upstairs!

1163
00:54:00,738 --> 00:54:03,708
It's a little white bottle
with a yellow safety cap!

1164
00:54:03,774 --> 00:54:05,435
All right, boss!

1165
00:54:05,509 --> 00:54:08,877
I'm sorry if I hurt you.

1166
00:54:08,979 --> 00:54:11,539
I wanna pay for your
hospital bills.

1167
00:54:11,615 --> 00:54:15,347
But I'm gonna ask
for a favor in return.

1168
00:54:15,419 --> 00:54:18,445
I want you to stop saying...

1169
00:54:21,592 --> 00:54:27,031
...I killed your friend,
because I didn't.

1170
00:54:29,066 --> 00:54:30,898
Can you do that for me, Jim?

1171
00:54:30,968 --> 00:54:33,960
Oh, I can absolutely do that.

1172
00:54:34,037 --> 00:54:37,200
You didn't kill Babs,
you didn't kill Cal.

1173
00:54:37,274 --> 00:54:41,905
There. I said it. I feel
better. I hope you feel better.

1174
00:54:45,282 --> 00:54:48,308
No. I don't.

1175
00:54:48,685 --> 00:54:51,416
'Cause I'd like to smush you!

1176
00:54:53,257 --> 00:54:55,658
You're tickin' me off!

1177
00:54:56,426 --> 00:54:58,758
Nicky! Nicky!
Yeah?

1178
00:54:58,829 --> 00:55:03,130
The, uh, the Jacuzzi drawer
where Dawn keeps her suntan lotion!

1179
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:05,794
I'm havin' a hard time
keepin' level here!

1180
00:55:05,869 --> 00:55:07,803
Okay, okay!
Uh, well, could you try?

1181
00:55:07,905 --> 00:55:10,033
I can't take much more abuse.

1182
00:55:13,277 --> 00:55:17,214
I'm gonna ask you
to stop accusin' me

1183
00:55:17,314 --> 00:55:20,249
of killin' that idiot
bitch, okay?

1184
00:55:20,951 --> 00:55:22,077
Done.

1185
00:55:22,820 --> 00:55:24,151
NICKY: I got 'em, boss!

1186
00:55:25,789 --> 00:55:27,120
Well...

1187
00:55:27,491 --> 00:55:30,324
Well, this has really been enjoyable. Uh,
would you...

1188
00:55:30,394 --> 00:55:34,695
Would you be kind enough to,
uh, take me to my ambulance?

1189
00:55:34,765 --> 00:55:38,258
Oh, I'm gonna be level in a
minute. You gonna stay for lunch?

1190
00:55:38,335 --> 00:55:41,965
Well, the ambulance is double
parked and I got a lot of things to do.

1191
00:55:42,039 --> 00:55:44,838
Tape up my lip,
empty out my shoes.

1192
00:55:45,542 --> 00:55:48,705
Well, remember what I told
you. You do me that favor.

1193
00:55:48,779 --> 00:55:50,269
I owe you!

1194
00:55:50,347 --> 00:55:52,315
Done. Good. Huh!

1195
00:55:52,549 --> 00:55:55,678
Uh, your name was,
uh, Nicky, was it?

1196
00:55:55,752 --> 00:55:57,413
Yeah.
Well, let's, uh...

1197
00:55:57,487 --> 00:56:00,787
Leave? Yeah,
good idea. Shall we?

1198
00:56:08,899 --> 00:56:11,391
BABS: Leon bought a new
fishing boat yesterday.

1199
00:56:11,468 --> 00:56:13,732
It's the first time
I've seen him happy.

1200
00:56:13,804 --> 00:56:15,772
Cal worked for him
last summer in the storeroom

1201
00:56:15,839 --> 00:56:20,106
and said that Leon was a pessimist
who always saw the glass as half empty.

1202
00:56:20,177 --> 00:56:23,408
He's a grouch,
but a lovable one.

1203
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:26,381
On the bright side,
Corey got a new parole officer,

1204
00:56:26,450 --> 00:56:29,943
and this time I'm hoping
he can finally get it right.

(CAR DOOR SHUTS)

1207
00:56:45,669 --> 00:56:47,501
Hi.

1208
00:56:47,571 --> 00:56:49,096
(SIGHS) You look different.

1209
00:56:49,206 --> 00:56:54,007
Well, nylon isn't my best fabric.
I'm much snappier in tweed.

1210
00:56:54,077 --> 00:56:56,739
The University closed down
the Criminal Behavior class.

1211
00:56:56,813 --> 00:56:59,544
Oh, what a bummer.
Leaves my fifth period open.

1212
00:56:59,616 --> 00:57:02,711
And your friend Chapman
wrote a letter to the Dean

1213
00:57:02,786 --> 00:57:04,948
saying that the reason
the accident happened

1214
00:57:05,022 --> 00:57:07,684
was because I failed
to control the curriculum.

1215
00:57:07,758 --> 00:57:09,192
I'm sorry, Trish.

1216
00:57:09,826 --> 00:57:12,727
Maybe I should write a letter and
straighten them out about Chapman.

1217
00:57:13,397 --> 00:57:14,796
Probably won't help.

1218
00:57:15,899 --> 00:57:18,231
Oh! Babs' diary?
Yep.

1219
00:57:18,302 --> 00:57:20,532
Anything in it?
Nope.

1220
00:57:20,604 --> 00:57:25,565
She was a sweet person. She cared more
about everybody else than she did herself.

1221
00:57:26,843 --> 00:57:29,312
As I was reading it...

1222
00:57:30,647 --> 00:57:33,673
You could see
what a tender soul she was.

1223
00:57:33,750 --> 00:57:36,185
Nobody ever gave her anything.

1224
00:57:37,854 --> 00:57:40,255
You...

1225
00:57:40,324 --> 00:57:43,123
You think a 10% tip
is too little?

1226
00:57:44,094 --> 00:57:47,462
Most people give 15. 20,
if the service is great.

1227
00:57:47,531 --> 00:57:49,898
Oh.
I always give 10.

1228
00:57:50,901 --> 00:57:53,268
All my life I've worked.
Nobody ever tipped me.

1229
00:57:53,337 --> 00:57:55,237
Yeah, but you can
set your fees.

1230
00:57:55,305 --> 00:57:57,364
Waiters and waitresses
are underpaid.

1231
00:57:57,441 --> 00:57:59,535
They depend on the tips
to make up the difference.

1232
00:57:59,609 --> 00:58:01,703
Seems like 10% is enough.

(SCOFFS)

get paid for my work.

00:58:08,218 --> 00:58:11,244
Damn! Angel stole my computer!

Rounding out a perfect week.

1237
00:58:13,924 --> 00:58:16,086
Look, what are we
gonna do now?

1238
00:58:16,159 --> 00:58:20,687
Ah, I guess we gotta go do what
we started to do a couple of days ago.

1239
00:58:20,764 --> 00:58:23,597
Go up to Babs' house and
see if there's anything up there.

1240
00:58:23,667 --> 00:58:28,127
You know, she kept a, uh, notebook
on her investigation of Hap Cortello.

1241
00:58:28,205 --> 00:58:31,175
It's gotta be there somewhere.

1242
00:58:31,241 --> 00:58:33,938
If she saw something to give
him a reason to kill her,

1243
00:58:34,011 --> 00:58:35,706
then we need to know
what it is.

1244
00:58:35,779 --> 00:58:38,874
Isn't that dangerous?
Well, it has been so far.

1245
00:58:38,949 --> 00:58:43,352
This time, I intend to control
the field trip and the curriculum.

1246
00:58:49,893 --> 00:58:52,021
Probably better
than the last time.

1247
00:58:56,366 --> 00:58:57,856
Melissa?

1248
00:58:57,934 --> 00:59:00,904
After you get your clothes on,
if you're armed, please don't shoot.

1249
00:59:00,971 --> 00:59:04,635
What are you talking about?
Of course I'm not armed.

1250
00:59:04,708 --> 00:59:06,870
Hey! It's Jimbo the gimbo.

1251
00:59:06,943 --> 00:59:09,310
Corey, what are you
doing here?

1252
00:59:09,513 --> 00:59:11,072
Hey, Mom's place is mine now.

1253
00:59:11,148 --> 00:59:13,913
Soon as the cops split,
I did a tight vector and crashed.

1254
00:59:14,017 --> 00:59:16,281
Do you think we could
get in off the front porch?

1255
00:59:16,353 --> 00:59:18,253
I've been drawing
a lot of fire lately.

1256
00:59:22,793 --> 00:59:24,488
Well, you've made
a few changes.

1257
00:59:24,561 --> 00:59:27,724
Yeah. Well, maybe that's
'cause you bled all over the place.

1258
00:59:29,433 --> 00:59:33,063
By the way, Melissa can't get that stain
out, so, uh, I'll be sending you the bill.

1259
00:59:33,470 --> 00:59:36,440
Oh, yeah. Like it was
everywhere. It was very ucky.

1260
00:59:36,506 --> 00:59:38,838
I mean, I wore his mom's
yellow rubber gloves,

1261
00:59:38,909 --> 00:59:41,606
but I'd like love to see
an AIDS certificate.

1262
00:59:42,279 --> 00:59:43,906
I've been leaving blood
all over town.

1263
00:59:43,980 --> 00:59:45,914
You'll have to wait
till I get xeroxes made.

1264
00:59:46,016 --> 00:59:49,179
Yo, Rockford.
Nobody invited you in there.

1265
00:59:50,187 --> 00:59:51,712
Where's your mom's stuff?

1266
00:59:53,557 --> 00:59:54,683
In storage.

1267
00:59:55,859 --> 00:59:59,261
What? Can't live here if all the
drawers and the closets are full.

1268
01:00:00,897 --> 01:00:02,331
Aren't you going
to hit him, Corey?

1269
01:00:02,399 --> 01:00:06,632
Melissa, a woman died here.
His mother.

1270
01:00:07,070 --> 01:00:08,765
I never knew her.

1271
01:00:10,841 --> 01:00:13,208
I'm choking on
all this sentiment.

1272
01:00:16,947 --> 01:00:18,506
Where's your mother's stuff?

1273
01:00:18,682 --> 01:00:21,413
Well, I ain't gonna be around
much after I sell this dump.

1274
01:00:21,485 --> 01:00:25,945
And I don't have any place to put it,
so if you're really interested...

1275
01:00:26,556 --> 01:00:28,046
I'll sell it to you.

1276
01:00:28,291 --> 01:00:30,521
Sell it? You serious?

1277
01:00:31,528 --> 01:00:33,997
Sure. How much you got
on you right now?

1278
01:00:34,064 --> 01:00:35,532
About 100.

1279
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:38,161
1007

1280
01:00:39,269 --> 01:00:41,704
What, are you kiddin'?

1281
01:00:41,771 --> 01:00:44,638
For a guy choking on sentiment,
that's a helluva fur ball there, eh, Jimbo?

1282
01:00:45,876 --> 01:00:48,743
I mean, this stuff has great
sentimental value to me.

1283
01:00:49,946 --> 01:00:51,107
250.

1284
01:00:53,617 --> 01:00:55,085
I've got 75.

1285
01:00:56,019 --> 01:00:57,680
175.

1286
01:00:59,356 --> 01:01:01,757
You are such a loser,
Rockford.

1287
01:01:01,825 --> 01:01:04,760
Ha! My brother Cal used to
always say you were okay,

1288
01:01:04,828 --> 01:01:08,787
you know, but I just never saw it. To me,
you're just always runnin' in place.

1289
01:01:08,865 --> 01:01:11,891
Why don't you give it up?
Start baggin' groceries.

1290
01:01:12,002 --> 01:01:17,406
It's always good to get advice from a
guy in the diamond lane to Terminal Island.

1291
01:01:17,474 --> 01:01:18,737
We got a deal?

1292
01:01:20,143 --> 01:01:21,406
Throw in your watch.

1293
01:01:22,212 --> 01:01:24,044
My...
Then we got a deal.

1294
01:01:36,293 --> 01:01:38,785
Come on. I'll, uh, show
you where I stored it.

1295
01:01:51,508 --> 01:01:53,909
Ugh. He is horrible!

1296
01:01:54,177 --> 01:01:56,509
That's not storage,
that's trash.

1297
01:01:56,580 --> 01:01:59,948
What makes him like that? Ah,
he got dealt an extra Y chromosome.

1298
01:02:00,016 --> 01:02:01,415
He can't help it
if he's a psychopath.

1299
01:02:01,484 --> 01:02:04,715
Do you think you could bring your car
in here and uh, we could pack the stuff

1300
01:02:04,788 --> 01:02:07,723
and get outta here,
before I do something really stupid?

1301
01:02:16,499 --> 01:02:21,733
It's good! Look at Babs.
She was having fun.

1302
01:02:21,805 --> 01:02:24,433
Hey, remember? She gave us all
coconut brownies that she made?

1303
01:02:24,507 --> 01:02:26,874
I got it. This is what
I was lookin' for...

1304
01:02:26,943 --> 01:02:28,274
Her investigative log.

1305
01:02:28,912 --> 01:02:31,609
She had this in the car
the night I was with her.

1306
01:02:31,781 --> 01:02:35,945
Leon, a little celebration?
With an olive in it, please.

1307
01:02:37,487 --> 01:02:39,319
Anybody else?
No, thanks.

1308
01:02:39,623 --> 01:02:40,954
Not me.

1309
01:02:42,525 --> 01:02:47,759
A colorful drunk is a long-standing
tradition. Every saloon needs one.

1310
01:02:48,298 --> 01:02:49,288
(LAUGHS)

1311
01:02:50,700 --> 01:02:52,725
Besides, it's in Babs' honor.

1312
01:02:52,802 --> 01:02:56,397
Zookie,
Babs worried about you.

1313
01:02:56,473 --> 01:02:59,602
She told me the day she died she thought
you were hittin' the bottle to hard.

1314
01:02:59,776 --> 01:03:02,746
She cared about
you. We all do. Yeah.

1315
01:03:02,912 --> 01:03:05,882
Instead of having a drink in
Babs' memory, why don't you,

1316
01:03:05,949 --> 01:03:08,213
uh, not have one
in her memory?

1317
01:03:09,319 --> 01:03:11,913
She was worried about me?
Very much.

1318
01:03:12,422 --> 01:03:16,484
She was afraid you were killing yourself,
and it broke her heart to watch you do it.

1319
01:03:27,237 --> 01:03:30,673
You really know how to ruin
a celebration, don't you?

1320
01:03:39,482 --> 01:03:43,214
Do you think we're missing
something real obvious?

1321
01:03:43,286 --> 01:03:47,189
Oh, probably. That's been the
keynote in at least half my investigations.

1322
01:03:47,324 --> 01:03:48,314
(LAUGHS)

1323
01:03:48,525 --> 01:03:50,994
Now, I know that you think
Hap Cortello did it.

1324
01:03:51,094 --> 01:03:54,621
What about Corey? That little
viper could have killed his mother.

1325
01:03:54,731 --> 01:03:56,665
He also could have
killed his brother Cal.

1326
01:03:56,733 --> 01:03:59,634
Yeah, I've known Corey
since he was six or seven.

1327
01:03:59,703 --> 01:04:04,106
The one thing about him, he was never
really up for the big one. He was a sneak.

1328
01:04:04,174 --> 01:04:07,007
He'd take your car radio
when you were out of town,

1329
01:04:07,077 --> 01:04:09,068
or steal your bike
when you went to the bathroom,

1330
01:04:09,179 --> 01:04:13,844
but I've never seen him get physical
with anyone. He's all show and no go.

1331
01:04:13,917 --> 01:04:17,547
Yeah, but he could have done it. He
needed money for drugs, or something.

1332
01:04:17,620 --> 01:04:20,453
He goes to his mom,
they fight about it,

1333
01:04:20,523 --> 01:04:22,116
he loses his temper
and he kills her.

1334
01:04:23,026 --> 01:04:25,688
I just can't see him banging
away at her with a .22.

1335
01:04:25,762 --> 01:04:27,457
It just doesn't fit
my picture of him.

1336
01:04:27,897 --> 01:04:29,058
Anything in here?

1337
01:04:29,299 --> 01:04:33,293
I got six addresses out of there. She
followed him to a warehouse on Slauson,

1338
01:04:33,370 --> 01:04:37,898
a beach house in Malibu, a bar in
Venice called the Pineapple Factory,

1339
01:04:38,041 --> 01:04:42,877
a nightclub on Melrose, and two motels
in Glendale where he met different women.

1340
01:04:42,979 --> 01:04:45,471
Neither was his wife.
Hmm.

1341
01:04:45,882 --> 01:04:49,580
So what are you thinkin'?
We need to find a transformer.

1342
01:04:51,521 --> 01:04:54,547
A transformer?
Street slang.

1343
01:04:54,724 --> 01:04:57,318
Transformer is somebody
who would roll over

1344
01:04:57,394 --> 01:05:00,159
on anyone immediately
to save themselves.

1345
01:05:01,097 --> 01:05:02,394
You know one of those?

1346
01:05:03,800 --> 01:05:05,165
Intimately.

1347
01:05:05,468 --> 01:05:08,870
Jimmy, Jimmy, stop it!
I almost finished the paper!

1348
01:05:08,972 --> 01:05:10,838
Forget the paper.
The class got canceled.

1349
01:05:10,907 --> 01:05:14,343
You stole my computer. I told
you not to take my computer.

1350
01:05:14,411 --> 01:05:16,505
Well, I had to work on it
here because I had some

1351
01:05:16,579 --> 01:05:18,673
deep and pressing business
engagements I had to attend...

1352
01:05:18,748 --> 01:05:21,308
Yeah, like fencing the Hormel juicer? Yeah,
that, amongst others.

1353
01:05:21,384 --> 01:05:24,046
Angel, I am seconds
from ending your life.

1354
01:05:24,154 --> 01:05:26,919
You are circling the drain.
Don't mess with me.

1355
01:05:26,990 --> 01:05:31,291
I don't mess with you, ever.
Ever. Maybe once. Maybe twice.

1356
01:05:31,361 --> 01:05:33,625
Okay, I mess with you a lot!

1357
01:05:33,897 --> 01:05:37,060
All right, we'll get back to my
missing computer in a minute.

1358
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:39,225
I think I can get that
back for you, Jimmy.

1359
01:05:39,335 --> 01:05:41,394
I need some information.
Information?

1360
01:05:41,471 --> 01:05:45,066
Heh-heh, ding-dong! That's a
specialty. I can't give that away free.

1361
01:05:45,175 --> 01:05:49,476
I mean, that would affect my overall price
structure, my downstream revenue flow.

1362
01:05:49,546 --> 01:05:53,346
I mean, I can get you a watch, get you a
microwave oven, I can get you a Hormel juicer.

1363
01:05:53,416 --> 01:05:56,579
Man, all of that's yours. Especially the
Hormel juicer, 'cause we're overstocked.

1364
01:05:56,653 --> 01:05:58,815
But information?
That costs money.

1365
01:06:00,590 --> 01:06:03,287
Generally your credit
is acceptable. Let's deal.

1366
01:06:03,359 --> 01:06:04,849
Let's.

1367
01:06:04,928 --> 01:06:08,125
Hap Cortello.
What's he into these days?

1368
01:06:08,198 --> 01:06:11,657
Well, heh-heh, that's a broad
category. I mean, it'd be hard to ascertain

1369
01:06:11,734 --> 01:06:14,465
what a top-shelf yodeling
wacko like him was up to,

1370
01:06:14,537 --> 01:06:17,336
unless you surprise me with
some pertinent doohickeys.

1371
01:06:17,407 --> 01:06:19,171
Well, we know he's into drugs.
Uh-huh.

1372
01:06:19,242 --> 01:06:21,768
We know he's into vice,
we know he's got some extortion going.

1373
01:06:21,845 --> 01:06:25,645
You know, lots of action. But this is
something big. Something he'd kill for.

1374
01:06:25,715 --> 01:06:28,776
Well, I don't know, Jimmy. People on the
street aren't talking about that fruitcake.

1375
01:06:28,918 --> 01:06:30,818
Hey, cuidado!

1376
01:06:30,887 --> 01:06:32,981
Suitcases.
Suit... What?

1377
01:06:33,056 --> 01:06:35,081
He's selling suitcases.

1378
01:06:35,158 --> 01:06:37,525
I don't like the sound of that,
Angel. Make it sound better.

1379
01:06:37,594 --> 01:06:38,993
Well, you know,
knock-off stuff.

1380
01:06:39,062 --> 01:06:42,589
Some of that hoochy-Gucci
Italian leather goods.

1381
01:06:42,665 --> 01:06:44,633
You know, purses,
wallets, suitcases.

1382
01:06:44,701 --> 01:06:48,296
I mean, it's nationally a $10 billion
business. It's bigger than drugs.

1383
01:06:48,471 --> 01:06:51,736
So you think he's got a shipment
of knock-off bags in that warehouse?

1384
01:06:51,841 --> 01:06:53,741
Well, how do I know what
he's got in the warehouse?

1385
01:06:53,810 --> 01:06:56,711
You asked me to get you the
rumor on the street about Hap.

1386
01:06:56,779 --> 01:07:01,239
Okay, the rumor on the street is
that he's into counterfeit luggage.

1387
01:07:01,351 --> 01:07:03,149
He's got distributors
all over the city.

1388
01:07:03,219 --> 01:07:06,712
High class stores sellin" it at top dollar,
only he gets his stuff in Mexico.

1389
01:07:06,789 --> 01:07:08,518
Looks exactly like
the originals,

1390
01:07:08,591 --> 01:07:11,083
only when the weather changes,
the stitching falls out.

1391
01:07:11,895 --> 01:07:15,388
You know, this is not the way that
two old friends discuss problems.

1392
01:07:15,598 --> 01:07:20,058
Angel, my computer is back in
my trailer by tomorrow noon,

1393
01:07:20,136 --> 01:07:23,299
or you'll be discussing this
problem without your bridgework.

1394
01:07:25,241 --> 01:07:28,108
If you're interested,
the paper I wrote for you is brilliant!

1395
01:07:28,177 --> 01:07:29,235
(GROWLS)

1396
01:07:36,653 --> 01:07:38,178
Angel told you this,
didn't he?

1397
01:07:38,254 --> 01:07:40,723
Oh, I have other sources
besides Evelyn Martin.

1398
01:07:40,957 --> 01:07:42,186
Now, let me get this straight.

1399
01:07:42,258 --> 01:07:45,125
You want me to go down to this
warehouse down on Slauson and do what?

1400
01:07:45,261 --> 01:07:47,787
I want you to wait for
Hap Cortello to show up,

1401
01:07:47,864 --> 01:07:50,629
and then I want you to be the
cover story in The Blue Line.

1402
01:07:50,767 --> 01:07:52,633
That's the Police Department's
newsletter.

1403
01:07:52,702 --> 01:07:56,866
"Lieutenant Becker nabs
LA mob kingpin

1404
01:07:56,940 --> 01:07:59,136
"and a room full
of counterfeit luggage.”

1405
01:07:59,275 --> 01:08:01,972
A couple of problems. What
if the warehouse is empty?

1406
01:08:02,111 --> 01:08:05,672
Ahh, I know nobody trusts a guy
who says "trust me," but trust me.

1407
01:08:05,815 --> 01:08:08,910
Then I would need a warrant,
and there's no PC to get a warrant.

1408
01:08:08,985 --> 01:08:13,650
Lieutenant Becker, I know you don't
exactly relish my involvement in this case.

1409
01:08:13,723 --> 01:08:16,556
Are you kidding? I love
grading little blue books.

1410
01:08:19,028 --> 01:08:24,467
This is not strictly kosher, but it'd work,
because there's a legal precedent.

1411
01:08:24,534 --> 01:08:27,629
1 go into the warehouse,
and I get caught.

1412
01:08:27,704 --> 01:08:32,301
And then Jim, he runs and calls the
police because I've been kidnapped.

1413
01:08:32,976 --> 01:08:36,640
And since he witnessed a crime in progress,
you don't need a warrant.

1414
01:08:36,946 --> 01:08:38,539
Dennis, this is a great idea.

1415
01:08:38,915 --> 01:08:41,907
Of course, I'll be the one that gets
kidnapped and she'll call the police,

1416
01:08:41,985 --> 01:08:43,111
but it's perfect.

1417
01:08:43,186 --> 01:08:45,587
It was my idea.
I'm the victim.

1418
01:08:45,655 --> 01:08:47,123
No way. It's me.

1419
01:08:47,190 --> 01:08:48,180
No!

1420
01:08:48,257 --> 01:08:50,055
Ah!

1421
01:08:50,159 --> 01:08:51,854
(SPEAKING ITALIAN)

1422
01:08:51,928 --> 01:08:53,259
What's he saying?

1423
01:08:53,329 --> 01:08:56,128
He's saying, "Rockford
will be the victim."

1424
01:08:57,800 --> 01:08:59,097
(SPEAKING ITALIAN)

1425
01:10:17,714 --> 01:10:20,046
This is the sloppiest B&E
since Watergate.

1426
01:10:20,116 --> 01:10:21,777
Somethin' we can do for you,
Rockford?

1427
01:10:21,851 --> 01:10:23,649
Nicky, how you doin'?
Not good.

1428
01:10:23,720 --> 01:10:25,188
You want to answer
the question?

1429
01:10:25,254 --> 01:10:27,450
Well, I was passing out
copies of Watchtower.

1430
01:10:27,523 --> 01:10:28,718
I happened to be
in the neighborhood,

1431
01:10:28,791 --> 01:10:30,020
and I thought
I saw a light on.

1432
01:10:30,093 --> 01:10:31,993
Funny. Let's go.

1433
01:10:37,100 --> 01:10:40,161
Hey, Nicky. Nicky,
let me ask you something.

1434
01:10:40,236 --> 01:10:43,695
Just a question.
Has Hap had his Lithium today?

1435
01:10:44,607 --> 01:10:47,633
Oh, Rockford.

1436
01:10:47,777 --> 01:10:53,443
Rockford,
this is getting very annoying.

1437
01:10:53,983 --> 01:10:55,951
Well, you know,
(LAUGHS SHEEPISHLY)

1438
01:10:56,018 --> 01:10:58,248
I, uh, changed my mind
about lunch.

1439
01:10:58,321 --> 01:11:00,153
I thought maybe
we could have dinner.

1440
01:11:00,223 --> 01:11:02,749
But, hey, if this is a bad
time, we could reschedule.

1441
01:11:04,961 --> 01:11:06,292
Ah, you...

1442
01:11:07,797 --> 01:11:09,595
I love this guy!

1443
01:11:10,399 --> 01:11:12,424
This is a funny guy! Huh?

1444
01:11:12,668 --> 01:11:16,536
Hap, Hap, come on, now, Hap,
don't. Don't do it, Hap.

1445
01:11:16,639 --> 01:11:19,506
Hey, come on, I'm injured. You
don't... You don't want to hit a cripple.

1446
01:11:23,012 --> 01:11:27,313
No, don't, don't. Don't do that,
Hap. Argh! Ohh, hey, ohh!

1447
01:11:27,817 --> 01:11:32,118
Hold it. Hold it a minute. Hey,
I got a... I got a question.

1448
01:11:33,156 --> 01:11:34,590
What?

1449
01:11:34,824 --> 01:11:36,155
Whose is this?

1450
01:11:36,859 --> 01:11:39,260
It's his. He eats "em
all the time.

1451
01:11:40,329 --> 01:11:45,130
Son of a bitch! Nicky,
we're gonna be doin' some business.

1452
01:11:45,468 --> 01:11:48,438
Not very damn likely, slick.
(TIRES SCREECHING)

1453
01:11:52,742 --> 01:11:54,437
Get outta here, boss!

1454
01:11:54,510 --> 01:11:56,501
OFFICER 1: Everyone stay where
they are! OFFICER 2: On the floor!

1455
01:11:56,579 --> 01:11:58,513
Freeze!
You're under arrest!

1456
01:12:00,483 --> 01:12:01,951
Freeze!

1457
01:12:02,785 --> 01:12:04,947
OFFICER 1: Don't move. OFFICER
2: Put your hands behind your head!

1458
01:12:05,521 --> 01:12:09,185
Ah, Dennis. Dennis, you still got that
Jim-Jam wrapper in the evidence room?

1459
01:12:09,258 --> 01:12:11,727
Nah, I picked it up. You
told me that fat kid dropped it.

1460
01:12:11,794 --> 01:12:13,387
I left it in my shirt pocket
at home.

1461
01:12:13,462 --> 01:12:16,488
I could've been wrong about who dropped it.
You're gonna have to dust it for prints.

1462
01:12:16,566 --> 01:12:19,035
And then Mr. Zeeno here
may want to make a statement.

1463
01:12:19,101 --> 01:12:22,594
Save himself from bein' booked
as an accessory to Murder One.

1464
01:12:31,914 --> 01:12:33,814
(CHUCKLES GLEEFULLY)

1465
01:12:40,990 --> 01:12:44,756
You say that Mr. Zeeno dropped a candy wrapper
at the scene of Miss Honeywell's murder?

1466
01:12:44,861 --> 01:12:47,489
Well, that is, as we say,
essentially accurate.

1467
01:12:47,563 --> 01:12:51,227
The aforementioned Mr. Zeeno's prints were
on the said aforementioned candy wrapper,

1468
01:12:51,467 --> 01:12:54,459
which was at the scene of the
aforementioned Miss Honeywell's murder,

1469
01:12:54,537 --> 01:12:58,030
which indicated his complicity
in the aforementioned murder.

1470
01:12:58,341 --> 01:13:01,311
The aforementioned Mr. Zeeno
then offered to cooperate

1471
01:13:01,377 --> 01:13:05,177
with said investigation into
said suspect Joseph Cortello,

1472
01:13:05,381 --> 01:13:07,782
thereby turning
State's evidence.

1473
01:13:08,017 --> 01:13:12,011
The District Attorney said that said
evidence would not be made public.

1474
01:13:12,088 --> 01:13:15,490
He said that said evidence
would be said in court.

1475
01:13:15,558 --> 01:13:17,322
He said, um...

1476
01:13:17,393 --> 01:13:21,193
Huh. We'll bring you updates as they
come in. Now, back to you in the studio.

1477
01:13:23,232 --> 01:13:25,064
What do you want?
I got a little nervous.

1478
01:13:25,134 --> 01:13:26,124
Well said.

1479
01:13:26,235 --> 01:13:27,669
And said and said.

1480
01:13:28,070 --> 01:13:30,164
(ALL LAUGHING)

1481
01:13:32,575 --> 01:13:34,942
Good going, Jim.
You solved the murder.

1482
01:13:36,178 --> 01:13:40,877
Yeah, Jim. You can have your Denver
omelet on the house all next week.

1483
01:13:41,717 --> 01:13:43,151
Thanks, CRITCH.

1484
01:13:44,921 --> 01:13:49,449
Zookie, you know what I said the
other day? I didn't mean to upset you.

1485
01:13:51,127 --> 01:13:54,028
She cared for me,
didn't she, Jim?

1486
01:13:54,096 --> 01:13:55,291
Yeah.

1487
01:13:55,364 --> 01:13:58,061
You know, I found
a paragraph last night.

1488
01:13:58,134 --> 01:14:00,694
I don't think she'd mind
if I read it to you.

1489
01:14:01,871 --> 01:14:04,670
Let's me see...
Here it is.

1490
01:14:06,776 --> 01:14:11,509
"Zookie is one of my favorites.
Seeing him at the bar makes me

1491
01:14:11,580 --> 01:14:15,881
"both happy and sad. I'm happy
because he brings light to all of us,

1492
01:14:15,952 --> 01:14:18,944
"and sad because I know
he's somehow lost.

1493
01:14:19,021 --> 01:14:23,322
"Like all of us, he's looking
for something he can't describe.

1494
01:14:23,392 --> 01:14:25,520
"I pray he finds fulfillment.

1495
01:14:26,228 --> 01:14:29,892
"He's too good to lose
to the dark spot inside him."

1496
01:14:30,967 --> 01:14:35,461
Couple of times,
I was too potted to get home.

1497
01:14:35,604 --> 01:14:39,006
She let me sleep on the couch
at her house.

1498
01:14:43,045 --> 01:14:45,707
We took her for granted,
didn't we, Jim?

1499
01:14:45,781 --> 01:14:50,116
She had to die before (VOICE
BREAKING) we realized what we had.

1500
01:14:54,357 --> 01:14:55,483
Leon...

1501
01:14:56,192 --> 01:15:00,720
Is this glass half empty
or half full?

1502
01:15:01,097 --> 01:15:04,123
Ain't neither. Just booze
you ain't drunk yet.

1503
01:15:11,507 --> 01:15:13,236
Think I'll go home.

1504
01:15:14,410 --> 01:15:15,969
I've had enough.

1505
01:15:27,623 --> 01:15:30,854
You could help him, Leon.
He needs to quit.

1506
01:15:33,129 --> 01:15:38,158
Zookie the Bookie ain't gonna quit drinkin',
and he ain't gonna quit bettin' the nags.

1507
01:15:39,835 --> 01:15:41,064
People don't change.

1508
01:15:42,538 --> 01:15:46,236
Not you, not Zook, and not me.
Human nature.

1509
01:15:50,813 --> 01:15:52,577
Lemme run something
by you, Leon.

1510
01:15:52,648 --> 01:15:54,548
Yeah, sure.

1511
01:15:54,617 --> 01:15:58,019
Hap Cortello killed Babs 'cause
she was following him around, right?

1512
01:15:58,220 --> 01:16:00,348
Appears so. And she
was following him around

1513
01:16:00,423 --> 01:16:02,653
because she thought
that Hap killed her son Cal.

1514
01:16:02,725 --> 01:16:03,715
Yep.

1515
01:16:03,793 --> 01:16:07,252
There's no evidence to that
fact. Why would Hap kill him?

1516
01:16:08,164 --> 01:16:12,260
Well, he was working up there painting in
Cortello's pool house. He saw somethin'.

1517
01:16:13,302 --> 01:16:15,100
Well, that's what Babs said.

1518
01:16:15,204 --> 01:16:17,070
Well, when Hap had me
up at his house,

1519
01:16:17,139 --> 01:16:18,402
he told me he didn't kill Cal.

1520
01:16:18,474 --> 01:16:19,532
He said he liked him.

1521
01:16:19,608 --> 01:16:22,509
Now, I don't know,
it's strange. But I believed him.

1522
01:16:22,611 --> 01:16:24,511
You want this?
It's on the house.

1523
01:16:24,580 --> 01:16:26,105
Uh, no, thank you.

1524
01:16:28,084 --> 01:16:30,280
Ah, it just seems unfinished.

1525
01:16:30,986 --> 01:16:33,717
She just wanted to know
who killed her son.

1526
01:16:36,092 --> 01:16:37,389
Well, I'm gonna stay
on this

1527
01:16:37,460 --> 01:16:40,430
till I make sure
I know who did it.

1528
01:16:40,529 --> 01:16:42,122
That much I can do for her.

1529
01:16:45,734 --> 01:16:48,260
ROCKFORD: Chapman may have
closed this case, buy I don't buy it.

1530
01:16:48,337 --> 01:16:50,396
I'm gonna do some digging
on my own. You want to help?

1531
01:16:50,473 --> 01:16:51,872
I'm gonna start
first thing in the morning.

1532
01:16:51,941 --> 01:16:53,431
TRISH: Sure.

1533
01:16:53,542 --> 01:16:55,874
Jim, have you heard
from Tennis on Keats?

1534
01:16:55,945 --> 01:16:56,969
(LAUGHS)

1535
01:16:57,046 --> 01:17:01,108
Well, we don't talk too much since
he put two ounces of lead in my arm.

1536
01:17:01,183 --> 01:17:03,379
Well, you know,
he hasn't shown up in classes for two days,

1537
01:17:03,452 --> 01:17:06,945
and I tried calling his house
and there wasn't any answer.

1538
01:17:08,290 --> 01:17:11,920
Do you think that, uh,
he could've gotten even deeper into this?

1539
01:17:11,994 --> 01:17:13,758
That he's in even
more trouble?

1540
01:17:13,829 --> 01:17:17,265
Ahh, I don't want to hear
that. What's his address?

1541
01:17:20,236 --> 01:17:22,568
TRISH: This is it. 1526.

1542
01:17:42,391 --> 01:17:45,691
If this kid is packing,
this time I'm gonna feed it to him.

1543
01:17:45,761 --> 01:17:47,593
I thought you needed
a credit card for that.

1544
01:17:47,663 --> 01:17:50,792
No, no. Credit cards...

1545
01:17:50,866 --> 01:17:54,029
Button locks and sliding doors.
Picks and wedges for deadbolts.

1546
01:17:54,103 --> 01:17:57,198
It's a complicated science. Maybe
you should get it into the curriculum.

1547
01:17:57,640 --> 01:17:59,631
Unless it's open.

1548
01:18:17,326 --> 01:18:21,263
Oh, my God.
Is he dead?

1549
01:18:28,537 --> 01:18:31,199
Yeah, and for a long time.

1550
01:18:36,779 --> 01:18:39,339
I'm sure getting tired
of finding bodies.

1551
01:18:40,549 --> 01:18:43,484
Here's the last number he
dialed. Could you take this down?

1552
01:18:43,652 --> 01:18:47,748
213-555-0187.

1553
01:18:47,890 --> 01:18:49,949
(KEYS BEEPING)

1554
01:18:52,628 --> 01:18:54,596
Dennis Becker, please.

1555
01:18:55,698 --> 01:18:58,599
Dennis, I found another one.

1556
01:19:04,273 --> 01:19:08,107
You're the new body-finding champion
of the Western Hemisphere, aren't you?

1557
01:19:08,177 --> 01:19:09,474
Did you kill him, Rockford?

1558
01:19:09,545 --> 01:19:12,037
Oh, even you don't believe
I killed this guy.

1559
01:19:12,114 --> 01:19:14,640
Why not? He shot you,
you shot him. That plays good for me.

1560
01:19:14,717 --> 01:19:17,709
I have an alibi, Chapman.
You be very careful here,

1561
01:19:17,786 --> 01:19:20,255
because we have a history
together, and it includes

1562
01:19:20,322 --> 01:19:22,848
scores of problematic
judicial encounters.

1563
01:19:22,992 --> 01:19:27,987
You book me, and I'll have Beth Van Zandt
set up an asset inventory on your front lawn.

1564
01:19:28,063 --> 01:19:30,623
Captain, it's a suicide,
and that's the way I'm gonna book it.

1565
01:19:31,500 --> 01:19:34,959
I hate you, Rockford.
You're pond scum.

1566
01:19:35,037 --> 01:19:36,198
(BEEPER SOUNDING)

1567
01:19:36,272 --> 01:19:39,139
Damn.
Deputy Chief again.

1568
01:19:39,208 --> 01:19:43,167
If I find out who wrote the
department that letter about the class,

1569
01:19:43,245 --> 01:19:44,804
I'm gonna kill him.

1570
01:19:45,881 --> 01:19:47,178
Don't look at me.

1571
01:19:48,584 --> 01:19:50,882
It's not a suicide, Dennis.
Prove it.

1572
01:19:50,953 --> 01:19:52,717
The guy was left-handed.

1573
01:19:53,589 --> 01:19:57,082
How do you know that?
Because I sat behind him in class.

1574
01:19:57,192 --> 01:19:59,354
It's true.
He was left-handed.

1575
01:19:59,428 --> 01:20:01,396
He might have been
pigheaded and relentless,

1576
01:20:01,463 --> 01:20:05,195
but I don't think he shot himself in
the head and then changed gun hands.

1577
01:20:05,267 --> 01:20:07,793
Also, I'll bet if you follow
the track of the bullet,

1578
01:20:07,870 --> 01:20:09,838
you'll find it won't fit
with the suicide.

1579
01:20:09,938 --> 01:20:11,303
What are you trying to say?

1580
01:20:11,540 --> 01:20:14,032
I'm saying it's another
aforementioned murder.

1581
01:20:14,343 --> 01:20:16,835
The kid was popped.
Why?

1582
01:20:17,179 --> 01:20:19,841
Probably for stickin' his nose
in where it doesn't belong.

1583
01:20:20,783 --> 01:20:22,217
Look who's talkin'.

1584
01:20:22,318 --> 01:20:25,686
(SIGHS) Can I go home, Dennis?
Uh, my arm's throbbing,

1585
01:20:26,055 --> 01:20:28,956
my head's throbbing,
I think I'm starting to drool a little.

1586
01:20:29,291 --> 01:20:30,383
Yeah, get the hell
out of here.

1587
01:20:30,459 --> 01:20:33,724
Just make sure you're in the office
tomorrow to sign that statement.

1588
01:20:34,596 --> 01:20:36,860
ROCKFORD: Okay, so who killed
Tennis on Keats?

1589
01:20:36,932 --> 01:20:39,492
TRISH: I have no idea.
In school, it's all science.

1590
01:20:39,568 --> 01:20:42,094
But when you're out there in
the field and real people are dead,

1591
01:20:42,171 --> 01:20:43,798
it just... None of it
makes sense.

1592
01:20:44,039 --> 01:20:47,031
Yeah, well, it's the difference in
finding your way and looking back.

1593
01:20:47,109 --> 01:20:50,238
We're still finding our way. Now,
Tennis on Keats found the answer,

1594
01:20:50,346 --> 01:20:53,077
or something reasonably
close to the answer.

1595
01:20:53,449 --> 01:20:56,009
Hap Cortello didn't kill him
because he was in jail,

1596
01:20:56,085 --> 01:20:57,849
and I don't believe
any of his crew did

1597
01:20:57,920 --> 01:21:00,685
because they're not gonna be that
loyal to a guy that's goin' to Death Row.

1598
01:21:01,090 --> 01:21:02,888
Well, then who did kill him?

1599
01:21:04,426 --> 01:21:07,054
Do you have that
phone number? Yeah.

1600
01:21:09,732 --> 01:21:13,862
Well, maybe whoever's at the
end of this line can tell us something.

1601
01:21:30,319 --> 01:21:32,117
ROCKFORD: It's gotta be
somebody Cal knew.

1602
01:21:32,187 --> 01:21:35,316
TRISH: I still think it was his
brother. Everybody loved Cal.

1603
01:21:35,391 --> 01:21:37,553
It seems obvious that Corey
just couldn't deal with it.

1604
01:21:38,594 --> 01:21:43,327
Eh, maybe. I hate to think it
could've gone down that way.

1605
01:21:43,399 --> 01:21:46,960
I mean, Babs' family
destroying itself from the inside.

1606
01:21:47,236 --> 01:21:52,140
Most people in law enforcement
are cynics. You are a romantic.

1607
01:21:52,975 --> 01:21:54,170
Pretty cute, isn't it?

1608
01:21:56,211 --> 01:21:59,306
I can't go diggin' around in my files
for a bunch of useless old information.

1609
01:21:59,448 --> 01:22:02,315
Mr. Liggitt, please help us.

1610
01:22:02,384 --> 01:22:05,410
We've nowhere else to go.
Two people have died.

1611
01:22:06,855 --> 01:22:08,254
50 bucks.

1612
01:22:10,426 --> 01:22:14,294
I got 20. We ought to save
something for gas. I'm almost on empty.

1613
01:22:14,363 --> 01:22:16,457
I've got 15.
30.

1614
01:22:23,839 --> 01:22:26,467
In the old days,
I'd just offer to deck a guy like that,

1615
01:22:26,542 --> 01:22:28,636
but I'm not healing
as fast as I used to.

1616
01:22:28,777 --> 01:22:32,714
Don't apologize. He's a creep.
We're bound to run into a few.

1617
01:22:32,781 --> 01:22:34,340
Here it is.

1618
01:22:34,616 --> 01:22:37,244
Joseph Cortello's
pool house. Replumb.

1619
01:22:37,319 --> 01:22:39,378
He was having it renovated.

1620
01:22:39,455 --> 01:22:42,584
We put in a Jacuzzi and new
showers. Gumpy Cook did that work.

1621
01:22:42,658 --> 01:22:43,853
Does he still work here?

1622
01:22:43,959 --> 01:22:48,055
He's in the back. Probably stealin'
lock washers instead of loadin' the truck.

1623
01:22:48,163 --> 01:22:50,530
Don't hold him up.
He's late.

1624
01:22:52,434 --> 01:22:55,699
WOMAN OVER PA:
Joey B, your delivery is in.

1625
01:22:55,904 --> 01:22:58,134
Maybe we should ask
what he looks like.

1626
01:22:58,273 --> 01:23:02,141
What, Gumpy Cook? With a name like that,
he's gotta look like Mr. Plumberbutt.

1627
01:23:02,211 --> 01:23:04,475
And there he is.

1628
01:23:07,049 --> 01:23:08,210
Hey, Gumpy.

1629
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:12,612
I know you?

1630
01:23:12,788 --> 01:23:14,483
I'm a friend
of Cal Honeywell's.

1631
01:23:14,790 --> 01:23:17,851
Two days ago, I would've said,
"Who the hell is Cal Honeywell?"

1632
01:23:17,960 --> 01:23:20,554
But you're the second guy
asked about him in 24 hours.

1633
01:23:20,629 --> 01:23:23,223
And the other one was,
uh, Tennis on Keats?

1634
01:23:23,298 --> 01:23:25,096
Yeah, that's the name.

1635
01:23:25,167 --> 01:23:28,000
He was, uh, checkin' on
some stolen food.

1636
01:23:28,604 --> 01:23:32,302
Asked me if that kid,
what's his name? Cal Honeywell,

1637
01:23:32,608 --> 01:23:34,599
mentioned it when he was up
paintin' that pool house.

1638
01:23:35,177 --> 01:23:36,736
What stolen food?

1639
01:23:37,646 --> 01:23:40,547
How the hell do I know?
But I remember,

1640
01:23:40,616 --> 01:23:43,210
this guy comes up there
to Cortello's house, uh,

1641
01:23:43,285 --> 01:23:46,414
about 12:00 noon the day
before they found Cal's body.

1642
01:23:47,656 --> 01:23:50,023
And these two, they having
this huge argument.

1643
01:23:50,092 --> 01:23:52,117
I mean, they're screaming
at each other and such.

1644
01:23:52,294 --> 01:23:55,264
And then, uh, they go out front,
and then about 20 minutes later,

1645
01:23:55,330 --> 01:23:58,300
this Cal kid comes back in,
and he's madder'n hell.

1646
01:23:58,433 --> 01:24:02,836
He starts paintin' trim,
but he's so mad, he's gettin' the, the...

1647
01:24:02,938 --> 01:24:05,407
the gold trim all over
the white fresh on the house.

1648
01:24:05,674 --> 01:24:09,474
And then he says he's mad at this
other guy and he's gonna turn him in.

1649
01:24:09,545 --> 01:24:11,240
And that was that.

1650
01:24:11,313 --> 01:24:13,338
You told Tennis on Keats
this yesterday?

1651
01:24:14,750 --> 01:24:17,720
Yeah. I mean, that's when
Keats said it was about stolen food.

1652
01:24:19,421 --> 01:24:21,150
And that's all he said.

1653
01:24:21,290 --> 01:24:23,224
Get that truck loaded, Gumpy!

1654
01:24:23,725 --> 01:24:26,592
You and Kelly gotta get that
job done at Oak Grove by 2:30.

1655
01:24:28,163 --> 01:24:32,430
I keep hopin' ol' Carl's gonna
blow a valve and take the big bust,

1656
01:24:32,501 --> 01:24:35,960
but he just keeps on strokin'.
Better get back at it.

1657
01:24:36,038 --> 01:24:39,372
Uh, this guy that Cal had
the argument with, uh,

1658
01:24:39,575 --> 01:24:43,569
was he tall, African-American,
say late 40s, early 50s?

1659
01:24:43,812 --> 01:24:45,678
Yeah. Didn't I mention that?

1660
01:24:46,782 --> 01:24:48,011
Nope.

1661
01:24:49,217 --> 01:24:51,311
But thanks for your help.

1662
01:24:59,061 --> 01:25:01,792
Old Zook didn't make it in
this morning.

1663
01:25:01,863 --> 01:25:06,824
Liver and his kidneys probably
arguing over that last gin-soaked pimento.

1664
01:25:07,369 --> 01:25:11,897
Yeah, old Zook. Kind of fun watchin'
him kill himself ounce by ounce.

1665
01:25:13,842 --> 01:25:15,241
What's that supposed to mean?

1666
01:25:15,310 --> 01:25:17,176
Let me ask you
a question, Leon.

1667
01:25:17,613 --> 01:25:19,707
Sure, go ahead. What is it?

1668
01:25:19,781 --> 01:25:22,580
Why do you suppose this place
can never turn a profit?

1669
01:25:27,289 --> 01:25:31,487
I don't know. How am I supposed
to know? I just work the bar.

1670
01:25:31,560 --> 01:25:34,427
Don't you also run the food
warehouse in the back?

1671
01:25:34,496 --> 01:25:37,090
So? Well,
you take inventory and everything.

1672
01:25:37,165 --> 01:25:40,897
Uh, log in the meat, check it out,
throw it away if it's bad, stuff like that.

1673
01:25:40,969 --> 01:25:42,368
Is this leadin' up
to somethin'?

1674
01:25:42,704 --> 01:25:45,605
Well, that boat you bought last summer,
what does a deal like that cost?

1675
01:25:45,674 --> 01:25:46,698
I don't remember.

1676
01:25:46,775 --> 01:25:51,110
Well, a Sea Ray 30-foot Sun dancer.
I've got the sales brochure right here.

1677
01:25:51,179 --> 01:25:54,979
As I recall, when I went out with you
the last time, you had everything on it.

1678
01:25:55,050 --> 01:25:57,917
You had navigation, Sat Nav.
You got that, right?

1679
01:25:57,986 --> 01:26:02,617
Furuno Radar, the 75-mile color
unit. Isn't that the rig you got?

1680
01:26:03,692 --> 01:26:08,254
Yeah, $105,000 plus tax puts
that little honey in the water.

1681
01:26:08,430 --> 01:26:09,989
You tr yin' to say
somethin', Jim?

1682
01:26:10,065 --> 01:26:14,559
Eh, Cal worked here the summer he died,
in the warehouse for you, as I recall.

1683
01:26:15,070 --> 01:26:18,529
You ea yin' I killed him?
And Babs? Not exactly.

1684
01:26:18,740 --> 01:26:22,734
No, I think Cal caught you
stealing from the Sand Castle.

1685
01:26:22,811 --> 01:26:25,746
Maybe skimming 10% off
the food and bar purchases.

1686
01:26:25,814 --> 01:26:27,976
That would lean out
ol' Critch's profit picture.

1687
01:26:28,517 --> 01:26:31,646
Cal confronted you, you went
up to Cortello's house

1688
01:26:31,720 --> 01:26:33,848
and you got in an argument
with him. You're nuts!

1689
01:26:34,523 --> 01:26:38,391
Ah, pretty soon, you know,
somebody starts takin' a swing.

1690
01:26:38,727 --> 01:26:41,822
Cal goes down, hits his head,
and he's dead.

1691
01:26:41,897 --> 01:26:43,695
I don't have to
listen to this.

1692
01:26:43,799 --> 01:26:46,496
And of course, there's,
there's Babs.

1693
01:26:47,736 --> 01:26:50,671
Babs is so sure that Cortello
killed her boy

1694
01:26:50,739 --> 01:26:52,468
that she, uh, starts
following him around,

1695
01:26:52,541 --> 01:26:56,171
finds the warehouse full of knock-off
luggage, and gets herself killed.

1696
01:26:56,244 --> 01:26:58,303
Then along comes
Tennis on Keats.

1697
01:26:58,413 --> 01:27:02,179
Smart-ass, hate-able,
but perceptive and bright.

1698
01:27:02,250 --> 01:27:04,651
He figures out you're stealing.
I don't know how he did that,

1699
01:27:04,720 --> 01:27:06,313
'cause he took it
to the grave with him.

1700
01:27:07,122 --> 01:27:10,319
It was all right in Babs'
diary, right in front of us.

1701
01:27:10,425 --> 01:27:14,055
How does a guy who pours
drinks for 7 bucks an hour

1702
01:27:14,162 --> 01:27:16,824
end up with a $105,000 boat?

1703
01:27:17,933 --> 01:27:19,458
(CHUCKLES)

1704
01:27:22,270 --> 01:27:24,238
You should've left it alone,
Jim.

1705
01:27:25,807 --> 01:27:27,297
(YELLING)

1706
01:27:39,788 --> 01:27:42,416
You can't beat this one,
Leon. The cops are already on their way.

1707
01:27:42,524 --> 01:27:45,653
I didn't mean to kill Cal.
It was an accident.

1708
01:27:45,761 --> 01:27:48,492
That's what happens when you
make the wrong things important.

1709
01:27:49,097 --> 01:27:50,895
Now I have to kill you, Jim.

1710
01:27:50,999 --> 01:27:55,368
I don't kill too easy,
Leon. I've had better guys than you try.

1711
01:28:45,287 --> 01:28:47,949
Damn! Damn! Ugh!

1712
01:28:49,157 --> 01:28:52,684
Damn! Broke out
all my stitches!

1713
01:28:54,596 --> 01:28:57,566
Everybody at the Sand Castle
gave you the benefit of the doubt.

1714
01:28:57,632 --> 01:29:01,728
You'd come in and growl at us,
we'd smile and call you the Sand Crab.

1715
01:29:02,037 --> 01:29:05,905
We were your friends.
We were all wrong about you.

1716
01:29:06,007 --> 01:29:11,173
From the very beginning, you were
nothin' but a mean, angry son of a bitch.

1717
01:29:11,246 --> 01:29:14,147
(SIREN WAILING)

1718
01:29:26,094 --> 01:29:27,357
Thanks.

1719
01:29:29,497 --> 01:29:32,728
Does it hurt? Maybe you should
take another pain pill.

1720
01:29:32,801 --> 01:29:34,895
It hurts where I can't get it
with drugs.

1721
01:29:34,970 --> 01:29:37,996
Not much to say, is there,
Jim? Nope. Lose-lose.

1722
01:29:38,106 --> 01:29:39,870
Old Leon. Who'd have thunk it?

1723
01:29:39,941 --> 01:29:43,571
Yeah, I know.
I'm gonna hit the sack early.

1724
01:29:43,645 --> 01:29:47,946
I'm tired of walkin' around
with my arm stickin' up in the air.

1725
01:29:48,016 --> 01:29:49,415
Feel like a wounded chicken.

1726
01:29:49,484 --> 01:29:50,474
Jim?

1727
01:29:51,987 --> 01:29:57,050
What you read about me in
Babs' diary really stuck with me.

1728
01:29:57,125 --> 01:29:59,025
I decided I'm gonna
get off the sauce.

1729
01:29:59,895 --> 01:30:02,990
This morning, I checked into,
uh, double-A.

1730
01:30:03,732 --> 01:30:05,723
Well, that's great, Zook.

1731
01:30:05,800 --> 01:30:07,734
At least something good
came out of all this.

1732
01:30:08,436 --> 01:30:12,464
You know, Leon said that nobody
ever changes. You can do it.

1733
01:30:14,209 --> 01:30:16,337
We all can.
All we have to do is try.

1734
01:30:24,486 --> 01:30:26,045
He's really down.

1735
01:30:26,121 --> 01:30:30,991
It's pretty hard when one friend is
responsible for the killing of two others.

1736
01:30:31,059 --> 01:30:34,893
Jim comes on like a tough guy,
but underneath,

1737
01:30:34,963 --> 01:30:37,694
he's pure warm and runny.

1738
01:30:39,601 --> 01:30:41,069
TRUDY: Well, I'll be damned.

1739
01:30:41,136 --> 01:30:42,604
ZOOKIE: What?
CARLOS: What?

1740
01:30:42,671 --> 01:30:44,662
He put on 20%.
