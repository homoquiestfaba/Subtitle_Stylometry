I wanted to be a priest.

from the evil of the world.

I saw the world
for what it really was.

00:01:12,904 --> 00:01:15,531
It wasn't so much
who I was going to save,

10
00:01:15,698 --> 00:01:18,076

the world from me.

You's a real tough
motherfucker now, huh?

Hey, general population,
I'll see you there.

Hey, you gonna nurse that bottle

What, you in a hurry, man?

78
00:06:06,155 --> 00:06:08,366
Pass that shit.
I need to warm up.

79
00:06:11,952 --> 00:06:14,830
I was just remembering
the first time

80
00:06:14,997 --> 00:06:16,832
Dave ever met my pop.

81
00:06:16,999 --> 00:06:19,210
Dude, I thought he was
gonna shit himself.

82
00:06:19,377 --> 00:06:20,795
You remember that?
You were stuttering.

83
00:06:20,961 --> 00:06:23,422
You were like, "N-n-n-nice
to meet you, s-sir."

84
00:06:23,589 --> 00:06:25,174
Fuck you.
Whatever, man.

85
00:06:25,341 --> 00:06:27,802
I don't blame you for being scared, man.
I've been scared of him too.

86
00:06:27,968 --> 00:06:29,887
Could be a mean old
son of a bitch.

87
00:06:30,054 --> 00:06:32,056
Nah, he was just all talk.

88
00:06:32,223 --> 00:06:34,892
All talk? That's all you've been
doing is talking.

89
00:06:35,059 --> 00:06:36,560
Start drinking.

90
00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:45,069
- Man, it is cold up here.
- Dave: Fucking freezing.

91
00:06:45,236 --> 00:06:47,238
Dave:
Hey, man, hey.

92
00:06:47,405 --> 00:06:50,241
You know why I love
being up here, man?

93
00:06:50,408 --> 00:06:53,160
It's just like
being above it all, man.

94
00:06:53,327 --> 00:06:56,497
Like no problems pressing
down on my shoulders.

95
00:06:56,664 --> 00:06:58,582
Hey, like if you need counseling,
I've got you covered.

96
00:06:58,749 --> 00:07:00,918
- But can I have the bottle?
- Yeah, right.

97
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:06,132

You tell him we'd be down
here by the old truck depot?

154
00:10:36,133 --> 00:10:37,635
Yeah, I told him.

155
00:10:37,801 --> 00:10:41,388

Valerie this, Valerie that.

- I'm waiting on that money.

00:11:46,036 --> 00:11:48,622
- You okay?
- Yeah.

169
00:11:52,793 --> 00:11:55,587
You sure?

170
00:11:55,754 --> 00:11:58,006
Like I got a choice.

171
00:12:00,801 --> 00:12:02,845
- ( gunshot)
- Oh!

172
00:12:03,011 --> 00:12:05,556
- What the fuck are you doing?
- I'm sorry, bro.

173
00:12:05,723 --> 00:12:08,475
( gunshot )

174
00:12:09,893 --> 00:12:11,729
Let's go!
Let's go!

175
00:12:18,235 --> 00:12:20,571
Sonny's voice:
As I laid gasping for my next breath,

176
00:12:20,738 --> 00:12:23,157
I knew God had given me
a second chance.

177
00:12:23,323 --> 00:12:25,743
But I was too stupid
to take it.

178
00:12:25,909 --> 00:12:27,745
I was going to get
what was mine.

179
00:12:27,911 --> 00:12:29,288
( groans )

180
00:12:29,455 --> 00:12:31,123
Sonny, what the fuck?

181
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:32,332
- Fuck!
- He shot me.

182
00:12:32,499 --> 00:12:34,293
- Who shot you?
- Vince, man.

183
00:12:35,586 --> 00:12:38,213
Are you fucking kidding me?
Sit down.

184
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:42,217
- Where'd you get hit?
- Up top.

185
00:12:42,384 --> 00:12:44,470
Lay down.
Lay down.

186
00:12:45,763 --> 00:12:47,097
Oh fuck.

187
00:12:47,264 --> 00:12:49,224
It's lodged
in your collarbone.

188
00:12:53,604 --> 00:12:55,522
Get your fucking dirty hands
out of there. Let me have a look.

189
00:12:55,689 --> 00:12:59,026
You got lucky. Looks like
it hit your cross. Let me get this off.

190
00:12:59,193 --> 00:13:02,488
- My mom gave me that.
- Yeah, I know.

191
00:13:02,654 --> 00:13:04,990
Hold on, you're gonna
need this. Here.

192
00:13:05,157 --> 00:13:08,118
'Cause this is gonna
pucker your asshole.

193
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:13,916
Move this.
Ready?

194
00:13:15,375 --> 00:13:18,045
Oh shit.

195
00:13:18,212 --> 00:13:19,963
It ain't even that deep.

196
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:21,715
It's fucking burning, man.

197
00:13:23,217 --> 00:13:24,968
I heard something
was gonna go down.

198
00:13:25,135 --> 00:13:26,553
I didn't think
it was you guys.

199
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,013
What did you hear, Joe?

200
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:30,891
Come on, let me finish
this shit, all right?

201
00:13:31,058 --> 00:13:33,769
Ahh! Shit!

202
00:13:33,936 --> 00:13:35,437
Fuck, it's in there.
Hold on.

203
00:13:35,604 --> 00:13:38,690
I see the shit.
I feel it.

204
00:13:38,857 --> 00:13:40,776
(groaning )

205
00:13:40,943 --> 00:13:42,945
Oh Shit. Shit.

206
00:13:43,111 --> 00:13:44,655
Hold on, hold on.

207
00:13:44,822 --> 00:13:46,824
Oh fuck.

208
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:50,786
Nice, huh? I'll make
a nice tongue stud with that.

209
00:13:56,041 --> 00:13:59,044
I can't believe he shot me, man.
What'd you hear, Joey?

210
00:13:59,211 --> 00:14:01,296
Vince was running his mouth

211
00:14:01,463 --> 00:14:04,132
to some connected guys downtown
that he's got a big score coming.

212
00:14:04,299 --> 00:14:06,301
Why would he say that?
We never kick back to them.

213
00:14:06,468 --> 00:14:09,304
I don't know. I think he was just
trying to buy some protection.

214
00:14:12,766 --> 00:14:14,768
Hold that there. Hold that.

215
00:14:22,025 --> 00:14:24,194
Where the fuck are you going?
You need to lay down.

216
00:14:24,361 --> 00:14:26,029
- I got to find him.
- Oh, yeah, genius?

217
00:14:26,196 --> 00:14:28,740
You gonna be walking around in
a bloody shirt with a bullet hole in it?

218
00:14:28,907 --> 00:14:31,034
Cops won't be looking for that.
Take that shit off.

219
00:14:31,201 --> 00:14:33,203
Here.

220
00:14:35,205 --> 00:14:39,710
- Listen, you know John R, right?
- Yeah, made guy, runs the card clubs.

221
00:14:39,877 --> 00:14:41,920
Yeah, down on Woodward.
Now I'll bet

222
00:14:42,087 --> 00:14:44,339
if someone was to go
down there this Friday night,

223
00:14:44,506 --> 00:14:48,594
he might run into Vince or someone
who knows where he is.

224
00:14:50,053 --> 00:14:52,931
- Thanks, Joey.
- Hey, hold on.

225
00:14:54,892 --> 00:14:56,810
Try not to get
your ass shot again, all right?

226
00:14:59,021 --> 00:15:00,564
You need anything,
you come back here.

227
00:15:00,731 --> 00:15:03,025
- All right?
- All right.

228
00:15:03,191 --> 00:15:05,736
(church bells ringing )

229
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:35,599
Do you want to talk about it?

230
00:15:35,766 --> 00:15:37,935
Talk about what?

231
00:15:38,101 --> 00:15:40,103
Whatever brought you here.

232
00:15:42,189 --> 00:15:44,358
I'm here to pray for a friend.

233
00:15:44,524 --> 00:15:45,776
Ah.

234
00:15:45,943 --> 00:15:47,819
Is he sick?

235
00:15:47,986 --> 00:15:50,906
No. He's dead.

236
00:15:52,574 --> 00:15:54,451
Forgive me for asking.

237
00:15:54,618 --> 00:15:56,870
Were you close?

238
00:15:57,037 --> 00:15:58,789
Yeah.

239
00:15:58,956 --> 00:16:00,958
We were like brothers.

240
00:16:01,124 --> 00:16:05,504
Then rest assured
he is in a better place now.

241
00:16:06,755 --> 00:16:10,050
How do you know?
You ever been dead before?

242
00:16:14,805 --> 00:16:17,891
There are many paths
to God, my son.

243
00:16:18,058 --> 00:16:21,520
I pray that yours
will not be too difficult.

244
00:16:36,284 --> 00:16:38,495
- There you are.
- Thank you, sir.

245
00:16:52,009 --> 00:16:54,177
Hey, beautiful lines.

246
00:16:54,344 --> 00:16:56,096
Yeah.

247
00:16:56,263 --> 00:16:59,558
I guess $5 million will buy you
a lot of things like that, huh?

248
00:17:01,727 --> 00:17:04,938
You see, my friend, I think we are
both looking for the same thing.

249
00:17:05,105 --> 00:17:07,607
I'm not your friend
and I'm not looking for anything.

250
00:17:07,774 --> 00:17:11,820
Okay, so let's cut
the bullshit, shall we?

251
00:17:11,987 --> 00:17:15,699
You took something from us
and we want it back.

252
00:17:15,866 --> 00:17:19,286
And I'm the guy
they picked to get it back.

253
00:17:19,453 --> 00:17:23,749
However, if you help us,

254
00:17:23,915 --> 00:17:26,585
we are willing to overlook
your part in it.

255
00:17:26,752 --> 00:17:29,880
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

256
00:17:30,047 --> 00:17:33,383
Hey, come on. It only took me
two days to find you.

257
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:36,762
And if I get those stones
without your help,

258
00:17:36,928 --> 00:17:39,848
we are going to meet again.

259
00:17:40,015 --> 00:17:44,227
Except this time you won't
even hear the hammer drop.

260
00:17:44,394 --> 00:17:46,938
Are we clear?

261
00:17:47,105 --> 00:17:49,524
Look, if it was up to my friends

262
00:17:49,691 --> 00:17:51,276
you'd be dead already.

263
00:17:51,443 --> 00:17:54,905
But I'm a patient man.

264
00:17:56,656 --> 00:17:59,910
You've got one week, huh?

265
00:18:00,077 --> 00:18:02,954
It was very nice meeting you.

266
00:18:05,749 --> 00:18:07,959
Oh, hey, ladies.
How's it going?

267
00:18:08,126 --> 00:18:10,378
What you guys up to tonight?

268
00:18:10,545 --> 00:18:13,590
Oh come on,
don't be like that.

269
00:18:13,757 --> 00:18:15,634
Could you get that door
for me, big man?

270
00:18:15,801 --> 00:18:17,427
Sure, no problem.

271
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:23,683
Why don't you stop playing
like such a fucking nit?

272
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:26,978
- I'm out.
- Shut your trap, you fuck stick.

273
00:18:27,145 --> 00:18:28,772
In fact, take that.

274
00:18:30,774 --> 00:18:32,275
Put your hands
where I can see 'em.

275
00:18:32,442 --> 00:18:35,779
- Are you robbing us?
- Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

276
00:18:35,946 --> 00:18:37,948
Who the fuck do you think
you're talking to?

277
00:18:38,115 --> 00:18:39,491
(grunts)

278
00:18:39,658 --> 00:18:41,284
All right, now let's start over.

279
00:18:41,451 --> 00:18:44,037
Okay, what can we do for you?

280
00:18:44,204 --> 00:18:46,623
Now we're getting somewhere.
I'm looking for Vincent Long.

281
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:48,667
- Anybody seen him?
- No.

282
00:18:48,834 --> 00:18:50,210
Of course
everyone's got amnesia.

283
00:18:50,377 --> 00:18:52,003
But if you get
your memory back,

284
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:54,381
tell him an old friend is
looking for him, all right?

285
00:18:57,509 --> 00:18:59,427
And now I'm robbing you.

286
00:18:59,594 --> 00:19:01,847
- What the fuck are you looking at?
- Nothing.

287
00:19:19,447 --> 00:19:21,408
- How's everything over here?
- Very good.

288
00:19:21,575 --> 00:19:23,368
Okay? Good.

289
00:19:23,535 --> 00:19:26,163
- All done?
- Yeah, I'm finished.

290
00:19:26,329 --> 00:19:29,082
- I just need the check, please.
- Okay.

291
00:19:34,129 --> 00:19:37,549
Here you go.

292
00:19:37,716 --> 00:19:39,968
Slow night tonight, huh?

293
00:19:40,135 --> 00:19:42,679
Yeah well, it pays the bills.

294
00:19:42,846 --> 00:19:45,640
I'm really a singer. I'm not
gonna be here much longer.

295
00:19:45,807 --> 00:19:47,684
And why is that?

296
00:19:47,851 --> 00:19:49,561
Well, I pray every night

297
00:19:49,728 --> 00:19:51,438
that God gets me
a record contract.

298
00:19:51,605 --> 00:19:54,024
- Does He hear you?
- Of course He does.

299
00:19:55,192 --> 00:19:56,902
I just have to wait my turn.

300
00:19:58,904 --> 00:20:00,822
No no, that's for you.

301
00:20:00,989 --> 00:20:03,867
Thank you.

302
00:20:04,034 --> 00:20:05,869
Good things are coming
to you too.

303
00:20:06,036 --> 00:20:07,579
- I promise.
-( laughs )

304
00:20:07,746 --> 00:20:09,456
Happy holidays.

305
00:20:16,087 --> 00:20:18,131
(grunts)

306
00:20:26,056 --> 00:20:27,349
You with me?

307
00:20:27,515 --> 00:20:30,727
- You got a name?
- Sonny.

308
00:20:30,894 --> 00:20:33,563
Like in "O what a sunny
fucking day we're having?"

309
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:35,315
Fuck you.
Who are you?

310
00:20:35,482 --> 00:20:37,817
All right, Sonny.
Sleepy-time.

311
00:20:44,199 --> 00:20:46,660
Are you out
of your fucking mind?

312
00:20:46,826 --> 00:20:49,037
Are you?

313
00:20:50,872 --> 00:20:53,416
I'm looking for my so-called friend.
He shot me.

314
00:20:53,583 --> 00:20:56,753
- I'm gonna find him.
- So you can shoot him?

315
00:21:00,257 --> 00:21:02,884
Are you retarded?
Are you handicapped?

316
00:21:03,051 --> 00:21:05,679
You think you're gonna
come into my town

317
00:21:05,845 --> 00:21:08,181
and take down poker games,

318
00:21:08,348 --> 00:21:10,809
shoot whoever you want
without my permission?

319
00:21:10,976 --> 00:21:13,144
Are you done
with your speech?

320
00:21:16,314 --> 00:21:18,316
Take it easy, Petey.

321
00:21:22,779 --> 00:21:25,115
What's the name
of the kid that shot you?

322
00:21:25,282 --> 00:21:28,868
Vincent. Vincent Long.

323
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:33,123
Vincent Long that runs
with John R's crew?

324
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:35,125
Yeah, he's been hanging around.

325
00:21:36,418 --> 00:21:38,003
Congratulations.

326
00:21:38,169 --> 00:21:40,672
You managed to piss off
a very important group of people

327
00:21:40,839 --> 00:21:43,758
that I make money with.
That means you owe me now.

328
00:21:43,925 --> 00:21:46,511
- Is that right?
- Yeah, that's right.

329
00:21:46,678 --> 00:21:49,097
Every fucking thing
I say is right.

330
00:21:52,392 --> 00:21:54,144
But I'm a fair guy.

331
00:21:54,311 --> 00:21:56,396
You help me out with my problem

332
00:21:56,563 --> 00:21:58,398
and I can help you out
with your problem.

333
00:21:58,565 --> 00:22:00,275
I'm listening.

334
00:22:00,442 --> 00:22:04,237
I used to know a guy,
laundered money for the Russians.

335
00:22:06,323 --> 00:22:09,367
But he had a funny way
of counting.

336
00:22:09,534 --> 00:22:12,537
For every $3 he laundered
he kept $1 for himself.

337
00:22:12,704 --> 00:22:15,957
Accumulated quite
a stack of dollars.

338
00:22:16,124 --> 00:22:18,084
$2 million.

339
00:22:18,251 --> 00:22:20,712
Only problem is the Russians
found out about it

340
00:22:20,879 --> 00:22:23,256
and chopped both his legs
off with a axe.

341
00:22:23,423 --> 00:22:25,425
But they never found the money.

342
00:22:25,592 --> 00:22:27,635
His family buried it with him.

343
00:22:27,802 --> 00:22:30,513
Well, I ain't digging up
no motherfucking dead body.

344
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:33,433
Shut the fuck up.

345
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,186
I don't want you to dig
anyone up.

346
00:22:38,021 --> 00:22:39,647
The Russians found out
where the money is.

347
00:22:39,814 --> 00:22:42,067
They're gonna take it
out of the ground tonight

348
00:22:42,233 --> 00:22:43,777
and you're gonna take it
from them.

349
00:22:43,943 --> 00:22:45,111
What's in it for me?

350
00:22:45,278 --> 00:22:49,240
Very few men know the exact
value of their life.

351
00:22:49,407 --> 00:22:51,576
Now you know
what yours is worth.

352
00:22:51,743 --> 00:22:53,870
$2 million.

353
00:22:54,037 --> 00:22:56,456
And just to make sure
you bring that money to me,

354
00:22:56,623 --> 00:22:58,500
I'm gonna send Petey
along with you.

355
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,838
Get out of here.

356
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,222
Okay, there they are.

357
00:23:17,519 --> 00:23:19,771
Kick back, relax.
We'll let them dig it up.

358
00:23:19,938 --> 00:23:22,524
( exhales )

359
00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:24,776
Hey, you got a plan?

360
00:23:24,943 --> 00:23:27,529
A plan? Oh yeah,
the plan's real complicated.

361
00:23:27,695 --> 00:23:29,406
You're gonna sneak
your ass down there

362
00:23:29,572 --> 00:23:31,991
and shoot those motherfuckers
in the head and grab the money.

363
00:23:32,158 --> 00:23:34,536
Then you're gonna run your ass
back up here like a crack nigger

364
00:23:34,702 --> 00:23:36,788
at a police funeral.
You down with that, homie?

365
00:23:36,955 --> 00:23:38,248
And where you gonna be at?

366
00:23:38,415 --> 00:23:40,834
Oh, close enough to shoot you
in the head if you fuck up.

367
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,420
What's to stop you from shooting me
after I bring you the money?

368
00:23:43,586 --> 00:23:46,423
That's what we call
a calculated risk.

369
00:23:46,589 --> 00:23:48,466
Ssst

370
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:51,886
Petey:
All right, they got it.

371
00:23:52,053 --> 00:23:54,514
- Let's go. Go get it.
- Shit.

372
00:24:13,366 --> 00:24:14,784
(grunts)

373
00:24:24,377 --> 00:24:25,503
Get down.

374
00:24:30,425 --> 00:24:33,845
(mumbling quietly)

375
00:24:53,156 --> 00:24:54,991
Got it.

376
00:24:57,327 --> 00:24:59,537
I get your $2 million
and you're still gonna shoot me?

377
00:24:59,704 --> 00:25:01,456
No.

378
00:25:01,623 --> 00:25:05,168
But I can't watch you
and drive this car at the same time.

379
00:25:05,335 --> 00:25:06,544
I need that other gun.

380
00:25:11,508 --> 00:25:13,384
Thanks, Sonny.
You're all right.

381
00:25:13,551 --> 00:25:15,678
You've got some balls.

382
00:25:15,845 --> 00:25:19,390
You don't have to worry
about your problem now.

383
00:25:19,557 --> 00:25:21,351
Mr. Biggs is a man of his word.

384
00:25:21,518 --> 00:25:23,520
I know you two got off
on the wrong foot.

385
00:25:23,686 --> 00:25:27,398
Hey, you did the job,
we've got his cash.

386
00:25:27,565 --> 00:25:29,317
Shit, let's celebrate.

387
00:25:29,484 --> 00:25:31,152
Know anyplace
where we can get a bag?

388
00:25:31,319 --> 00:25:34,948
I know a few people.
Let me make some phone calls.

389
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:37,992
Make it happen.

390
00:25:46,709 --> 00:25:48,836
Hey, what's up? It's Sonny.

391
00:25:49,003 --> 00:25:51,047
Yeah yeah yeah, I know.

392
00:25:51,214 --> 00:25:54,551
Hey, I want to stop by there.
You know, got to get a little something.

393
00:25:56,010 --> 00:25:58,680
All right. All right, cool.

394
00:26:14,946 --> 00:26:17,115
You're just gonna leave
the money in the trunk?

395
00:26:17,282 --> 00:26:18,741
Yeah, why not?

396
00:26:18,908 --> 00:26:21,119
Who the fuck's gonna know
I got $2 million in my car?

397
00:26:26,374 --> 00:26:28,251
( knocks )

398
00:26:31,087 --> 00:26:32,422
( knocks )

399
00:26:32,589 --> 00:26:35,633
- ( gunshots on game )
-( knocking )

400
00:26:44,058 --> 00:26:45,518
About time
you showed up, man.

401
00:26:45,685 --> 00:26:47,186
Come on, man.

402
00:26:47,353 --> 00:26:48,563
Who this?

403
00:26:48,730 --> 00:26:50,607
G, Petey; Petey, G.

404
00:26:50,773 --> 00:26:52,191
Is he a cop?

405
00:26:52,358 --> 00:26:54,569
Come on, why you gonna
ask me some shit like that?

406
00:26:54,736 --> 00:26:56,446
Shit, nigga, I had to ask.

407
00:26:56,613 --> 00:26:58,781
Y'all come on in.

408
00:27:01,576 --> 00:27:03,369
Damn.

409
00:27:07,206 --> 00:27:09,250
Hey man, the war is over.
Didn't you hear?

410
00:27:09,417 --> 00:27:11,544
Depends on which war
you're talking about.

411
00:27:11,711 --> 00:27:13,838
How much you need?

412
00:27:22,096 --> 00:27:24,849
Oh yeah.
I can handle that.

413
00:27:29,562 --> 00:27:31,606
G Money:
So how you been, Sonny?

414
00:27:31,773 --> 00:27:34,484
Sonny:
Hey, surviving.

415
00:27:34,651 --> 00:27:36,653
What's up
with this motherfucker, man?

416
00:27:36,819 --> 00:27:40,448
- That's business.
- Yeah, I can dig it.

417
00:27:47,205 --> 00:27:49,040
( laughs )

418
00:27:49,207 --> 00:27:51,000
I can smell that weed
from over here, man.

419
00:27:51,167 --> 00:27:52,710
Ooh, this is that fire.

420
00:27:52,877 --> 00:27:54,837
Now we call this
that snake weed.

421
00:27:55,004 --> 00:27:57,548
Got a partner, man,
he runs an exotic pet store--

422
00:28:00,134 --> 00:28:01,928
Hey, motherfucker.
What are you doing?

423
00:28:02,095 --> 00:28:03,513
This ain't goddamn
"Duck Hunt."

424
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,932
Relax. I can handle
a fucking gun.

425
00:28:06,099 --> 00:28:07,517
I'm quite sure
you can handle a gun.

426
00:28:07,684 --> 00:28:09,811
But I just spent $2,000
getting them triggers dialed up.

427
00:28:12,689 --> 00:28:14,190
He's your boy, huh?

428
00:28:25,368 --> 00:28:29,747
Anyway, man, he puts the weed
inside of boa constrictors.

429
00:28:29,914 --> 00:28:32,500
- And customs don't check it?
- There ain't nobody dumb enough

430
00:28:32,667 --> 00:28:34,293
to put their hand down
no goddamn snake's throat.

431
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:37,213
( laughs )
They're too cheap for the X-rays.

432
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:39,549
So they just wave them
motherfuckers on through.

433
00:28:39,716 --> 00:28:41,843
- ( gunshot )
- Holy shit!

434
00:28:42,009 --> 00:28:44,721
- Oh shit.
- This is bad, man.

435
00:28:44,887 --> 00:28:46,389
- Get a towel.
- What?

436
00:28:46,556 --> 00:28:47,724
- Get a towel.
- Why, man?

437
00:28:47,890 --> 00:28:49,308
This motherfucker's dead.

438
00:28:49,475 --> 00:28:52,103
- The fucking guns is loaded?
- Man, do you keep a car in the garage

439
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:54,605
without no gas in it?
You heard me, right?

440
00:28:54,772 --> 00:28:56,983
I told this motherfucker.
I said do not touch the guns.

441
00:28:57,150 --> 00:28:59,736
But he wanted to be the goddamn
Lone Ranger and start fucking with shit.

442
00:28:59,902 --> 00:29:01,070
I am not going down
for this shit.

443
00:29:01,237 --> 00:29:02,405
Get me something
to wrap him up in.

444
00:29:02,572 --> 00:29:04,323
I got two strikes.
This ain't gonna be my third.

445
00:29:04,490 --> 00:29:07,118
- Get me something to wrap him up in.
- Shit, where are we gonna take him?

446
00:29:07,285 --> 00:29:08,578
- I know a guy.
- Is he far?

447
00:29:08,745 --> 00:29:10,204
Motherfucker, you got
something better to do?

448
00:29:10,371 --> 00:29:12,081
No no no. You're right.

449
00:29:13,666 --> 00:29:15,918
- Shit.
- Okay.

450
00:29:16,085 --> 00:29:18,254
Okay. Man, you ought
to ashamed of yourself

451
00:29:18,421 --> 00:29:20,506
bringing this crazy white man
to my motherfucking house.

452
00:29:20,673 --> 00:29:23,301
- You know that?
- Help me turn him over.

453
00:29:23,468 --> 00:29:25,219
- Oh shit.
- Oh shit.

454
00:29:25,386 --> 00:29:27,263
- All right.
- Help me pick him up.

455
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:29,098
I ain't fucking with you
no more, Sonny.

456
00:29:29,265 --> 00:29:32,643
I am not fucking with you no more.
One, two, three.

457
00:29:32,810 --> 00:29:34,103
( both groan )

458
00:29:35,605 --> 00:29:37,231
- Oh.
- Oh shit.

459
00:29:37,398 --> 00:29:38,941
Damn.

460
00:29:39,108 --> 00:29:41,486
All right, all right.
Hold on. All right.

461
00:29:44,113 --> 00:29:46,365
What the hell were you
feeding this man?

462
00:29:52,455 --> 00:29:54,040
Right, where are the keys?

463
00:29:54,207 --> 00:29:55,708
He's got the keys.

464
00:29:55,875 --> 00:29:58,127
He got the keys?

465
00:29:59,712 --> 00:30:01,422
Well, you get 'em.
I ain't touching him.

466
00:30:09,263 --> 00:30:10,973
Getting my gun.

467
00:30:12,308 --> 00:30:14,727
Don't shoot your dick off,
motherfucker.

468
00:30:26,489 --> 00:30:28,866
Okay.

469
00:30:34,831 --> 00:30:37,625
G Money: You know I got
some nosy-ass neighbors.

470
00:30:41,254 --> 00:30:43,172
All right.

471
00:30:45,925 --> 00:30:47,134
Hey, Sonny man.

472
00:30:47,301 --> 00:30:49,178
Look, bro, you're my boy.
All right?

473
00:30:49,345 --> 00:30:52,849
Love you, man. But don't come
around here no more, all right?

474
00:30:53,015 --> 00:30:55,309
Bad for business, man.

475
00:31:16,664 --> 00:31:18,958
Hey, you're early.

476
00:31:19,125 --> 00:31:20,710
The suits are still here.

477
00:31:20,877 --> 00:31:22,753
- Come around the side in a mo.
- Okay.

478
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:25,256
All right?

479
00:31:25,423 --> 00:31:28,509
Grab his legs.

480
00:31:28,676 --> 00:31:30,803
Help me get him undressed.

481
00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:32,597
He's a big boy, isn't he?

482
00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:38,811
What are we gonna
do with his clothes?

483
00:31:38,978 --> 00:31:40,688
Oh, there's a furnace
in the back.

484
00:31:50,823 --> 00:31:52,909
( fabric ripping )

485
00:31:53,910 --> 00:31:55,745
Hmm.

486
00:31:55,912 --> 00:31:58,122
All right.

487
00:32:00,833 --> 00:32:02,585
All right.

488
00:32:10,718 --> 00:32:13,471
( sawing )

489
00:32:13,638 --> 00:32:16,724
( breathing heavily )

490
00:32:16,891 --> 00:32:19,226
(giggling )

491
00:32:30,029 --> 00:32:32,406
Yeah, bring the bin
a bit closer.

492
00:32:35,952 --> 00:32:37,787
There we go.

493
00:32:43,125 --> 00:32:46,045
Right.

494
00:32:46,212 --> 00:32:48,756
Did you know there's 207 bones
in the human body?

495
00:32:48,923 --> 00:32:52,385
And 27 of those are in the cranium.

496
00:32:52,551 --> 00:32:55,596
Now the average cranial capacity

497
00:32:55,763 --> 00:32:58,015
of modern man-- hit it, would you?

498
00:32:58,182 --> 00:33:00,476
--is 1200cc.

499
00:33:00,643 --> 00:33:03,479
And the average cranial capacity

500
00:33:03,646 --> 00:33:05,106
of Neanderthal man

501
00:33:05,272 --> 00:33:07,274
is 1800cc.

502
00:33:07,441 --> 00:33:09,652
I was just thinking
how fascinating

503
00:33:09,819 --> 00:33:12,863
that a creature that we think
is a primitive caveman

504
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:16,242
actually had 27% more brains

505
00:33:16,409 --> 00:33:18,995
than anyone alive today.

506
00:33:19,161 --> 00:33:21,664
Sonny's voice: As I listened
to the butcher rambling on

507
00:33:21,831 --> 00:33:24,500
it hit me--
Vince set up the score.

508
00:33:24,667 --> 00:33:26,544
So the driver must have
been in on it.

509
00:33:26,711 --> 00:33:29,839
If I found her,
I'd be that much closer to him.

510
00:33:30,006 --> 00:33:31,882
As for Petey, well...

511
00:33:32,049 --> 00:33:35,594
let's just say there's a reason
I'll never eat a hamburger again.

512
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:18,554
( car starts )

513
00:34:46,499 --> 00:34:48,000
Drive around the block.

514
00:34:48,167 --> 00:34:50,795
( gasps )
Okay.

515
00:34:50,961 --> 00:34:53,672
Okay. Okay, please.

516
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:56,133
( whimpers )

517
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:58,677
Please take it easy.

518
00:35:00,429 --> 00:35:02,223
This is far enough.
Pull over.

519
00:35:03,349 --> 00:35:05,601
Please don't hurt me.

520
00:35:05,768 --> 00:35:08,104
Shut it off.

521
00:35:09,605 --> 00:35:11,690
- Okay.
- What's your name?

522
00:35:11,857 --> 00:35:14,527
Mia.

523
00:35:14,693 --> 00:35:16,570
You recognize me?

524
00:35:18,405 --> 00:35:21,367
No, I'm sorry.
I don't. Should I?

525
00:35:21,534 --> 00:35:24,703
An Iranian diamond broker got jacked
on the corner of 6th and Santa Fe.

526
00:35:24,870 --> 00:35:27,373
( breathes heavily )

527
00:35:28,916 --> 00:35:30,292
Yeah, that's right.

528
00:35:30,459 --> 00:35:32,086
I didn't get my share.
Where is he?

529
00:35:32,253 --> 00:35:35,965
The blonde guy? I swear
I have not seen him since then.

530
00:35:36,132 --> 00:35:38,259
L-- I met him
through some friends.

531
00:35:38,425 --> 00:35:41,637
He offered me $5,000
to take this guy to a spot.

532
00:35:41,804 --> 00:35:43,305
- Bullshit.
- No no no no.

533
00:35:43,472 --> 00:35:45,015
I swear to God.
(crying )

534
00:35:45,182 --> 00:35:47,643
I'm telling you the truth.
You have to believe me.

535
00:35:47,810 --> 00:35:50,271
I did not know that my client
was gonna get hurt.

536
00:35:50,437 --> 00:35:53,190
He promised me that
that wasn't going to happen.

537
00:35:53,357 --> 00:35:56,485
I swear to God I'm telling you
the truth. You have to believe me.

538
00:35:56,652 --> 00:35:58,821
Please, believe me.

539
00:35:58,988 --> 00:36:01,240
- Mia.
- Yes?

540
00:36:01,407 --> 00:36:04,535
For your sake I hope
you're telling the truth.

541
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:13,794
Oh God.

542
00:37:33,123 --> 00:37:35,334
Gotcha.

543
00:38:36,312 --> 00:38:38,105
Whoa whoa whoa
whoa whoa.

544
00:38:38,272 --> 00:38:40,316
There's no money
in the house.

545
00:38:40,482 --> 00:38:41,817
Vincent Long, you know him?

546
00:38:41,984 --> 00:38:44,653
No, I've never heard of him.

547
00:38:47,614 --> 00:38:49,700
Okay, yeah, I know him.

548
00:38:49,867 --> 00:38:52,202
Sit your ass down.

549
00:38:58,542 --> 00:39:00,002
Let's start with who you are.

550
00:39:00,169 --> 00:39:02,463
I'm Russell.

551
00:39:02,629 --> 00:39:05,799
I work for
the diamond exchange.

552
00:39:05,966 --> 00:39:09,511
Your friend came to me, asked me if
I could move $5 million in uncut stones.

553
00:39:09,678 --> 00:39:11,430
He brought 'em, I paid him.

554
00:39:11,597 --> 00:39:13,390
Done deal.
Everybody got their share.

555
00:39:13,557 --> 00:39:14,892
Not everybody.

556
00:39:15,059 --> 00:39:17,394
Well, obviously.

557
00:39:17,561 --> 00:39:20,147
- What's the girl's angle?
- Mia?

558
00:39:20,314 --> 00:39:21,857
She's my girlfriend.

559
00:39:22,024 --> 00:39:24,234
We needed a driver
who wouldn't freak out.

560
00:39:24,401 --> 00:39:26,945
So we planted her
at the car service.

561
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:30,616
Look, I can't help you.

562
00:39:30,783 --> 00:39:33,827
I move diamonds.
That's all I do.

563
00:39:33,994 --> 00:39:35,996
People don't get their share,
some guy gets clipped,

564
00:39:36,163 --> 00:39:38,082
it's not my fucking problem.
Hey, whoa, hey!

565
00:39:38,248 --> 00:39:40,334
- Dave Hall.
- What?

566
00:39:40,501 --> 00:39:43,837
Say it, Dave Hall.
Say it, God damn it.

567
00:39:44,004 --> 00:39:45,756
- Dave Hall.
- Dave Hall! Dave Hall.

568
00:39:45,923 --> 00:39:47,633
That wasn't just
anybody who got clipped.

569
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:50,302
That was my long-time
friend Dave Hall.

570
00:39:51,929 --> 00:39:54,640
Hey hey, I can help you
get Vince.

571
00:39:54,807 --> 00:39:57,184
- Yeah?
- Yeah, it won't be easy.

572
00:39:57,351 --> 00:40:00,229
He's got a place
he hangs out over on 3rd.

573
00:40:00,396 --> 00:40:03,941
Couple of guys, tough--
real stone killers.

574
00:40:06,402 --> 00:40:08,529
Now when you see him
you to give him a message.

575
00:40:08,695 --> 00:40:11,490
Tell him his old friend from high school
is looking for him.

576
00:40:19,873 --> 00:40:22,292
Oh, you're kidding me.
You're kidding me, right?

577
00:40:22,459 --> 00:40:24,420
Really?

578
00:40:24,586 --> 00:40:27,005
- Put your arms down. Come around here.
- Unbelievable.

579
00:40:27,172 --> 00:40:29,258
So what are you gonna
do about this guy?

580
00:40:30,968 --> 00:40:34,388
What, no hello?
That's fucking rude.

581
00:40:34,555 --> 00:40:37,391
Oh, I'm sorry. Hello.

582
00:40:37,558 --> 00:40:39,935
Now what the fuck are you
gonna do about this guy?

583
00:40:40,102 --> 00:40:42,479
He came to my house
last night, Vince.

584
00:40:42,646 --> 00:40:44,231
My house.

585
00:40:44,398 --> 00:40:47,109
This is your fuck up.
This was your end of the deal.

586
00:40:47,276 --> 00:40:48,944
- My end?
- Yes.

587
00:40:49,111 --> 00:40:51,822
Now take care of it.

588
00:40:51,989 --> 00:40:53,740
What did you tell him?

589
00:40:53,907 --> 00:40:54,950
What do you mean?

590
00:40:55,117 --> 00:40:57,953
I mean what
did you tell him?

591
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:00,539
Uh, how about not a goddamn thing?
What are you talking about?

592
00:41:00,706 --> 00:41:03,292
Russell, I know how weak you are,
so just tell me what you told him.

593
00:41:03,459 --> 00:41:05,335
I didn't-- I didn't say--
I didn't say anything.

594
00:41:05,502 --> 00:41:08,130
You're still alive.

595
00:41:08,297 --> 00:41:10,132
That means you
told him something.

596
00:41:10,299 --> 00:41:12,468
Now I want to know
what the fuck it was.

597
00:41:12,634 --> 00:41:15,012
Okay, you know what?
Yes.

598
00:41:15,179 --> 00:41:18,223
I told you
from the beginning

599
00:41:18,390 --> 00:41:20,601
there could be
no loose ends, Vince.

600
00:41:20,767 --> 00:41:23,020
You needed money.
I told you how to get it.

601
00:41:23,187 --> 00:41:25,314
Somewhere along the line
you fucked up.

602
00:41:25,481 --> 00:41:28,650
These were your friends.
You should have handled it.

603
00:41:28,817 --> 00:41:30,819
( choking )

604
00:41:39,953 --> 00:41:42,080
Get that shit
out of here, Markus.

605
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:49,838
I-I can't believe
we're related.

606
00:41:50,005 --> 00:41:53,675
I fucked this guy for months
to make this deal happen.

607
00:41:53,842 --> 00:41:56,637
I never did like
the idea of you fucking him.

608
00:41:56,803 --> 00:41:59,640
You know what
we had to do, Vince.

609
00:41:59,806 --> 00:42:01,266
Now what about Sonny?

610
00:42:01,433 --> 00:42:03,727
I'm gonna handle it.

611
00:42:03,894 --> 00:42:05,103
( scoffs )

612
00:42:05,270 --> 00:42:07,397
How did he look?

613
00:42:07,564 --> 00:42:10,359
How the fuck do you think he looked?
He looked pissed off.

614
00:42:10,526 --> 00:42:13,028
I hope you know
what you're doing, Vince.

615
00:42:17,074 --> 00:42:19,952
( clock chiming )

616
00:42:22,871 --> 00:42:25,290
- Mr. B.
- Yeah, Tony?

617
00:42:30,295 --> 00:42:31,880
( sighs )

618
00:42:32,047 --> 00:42:34,258
You know, one of the greatest
pleasures of my life

619
00:42:34,424 --> 00:42:38,136
is eating my breakfast
and reading the sports page.

620
00:42:39,555 --> 00:42:41,223
I like reading the box scores.

621
00:42:41,390 --> 00:42:43,559
I like seeing who wins,
who loses.

622
00:42:43,725 --> 00:42:47,062
It relaxes me.
You know what I mean?

623
00:42:48,647 --> 00:42:50,148
( sighs )

624
00:42:53,235 --> 00:42:55,320
Now they say

625
00:42:55,487 --> 00:42:57,990
that they're gonna stop
publishing newspapers

626
00:42:58,156 --> 00:43:00,367
so people can read the stats
and the box scores

627
00:43:00,534 --> 00:43:02,369
on their fucking cell phone.

628
00:43:02,536 --> 00:43:05,080
Who wants to look at a cell phone
when you're eating food?

629
00:43:05,247 --> 00:43:08,083
It's ridiculous.
I'll tell you what it is--

630
00:43:08,250 --> 00:43:10,752
uncivilized.

631
00:43:10,919 --> 00:43:13,255
It's a different world.

632
00:43:13,422 --> 00:43:15,382
Same world,

633
00:43:15,549 --> 00:43:17,426
different toys.

634
00:43:20,387 --> 00:43:22,180
What do you hear
about Petey and the kid?

635
00:43:22,347 --> 00:43:24,182
Nothing yet.

636
00:43:24,349 --> 00:43:26,476
But we grabbed one
of the Russians this morning.

637
00:43:26,643 --> 00:43:28,854
Sal's softening him up
right now.

638
00:43:29,021 --> 00:43:31,440
All right.
Go take a look.

639
00:43:31,607 --> 00:43:34,276
I'll be down there
in a little bit, all right?

640
00:43:34,443 --> 00:43:36,445
- Give me a call if something changes.
- All right.

641
00:43:36,612 --> 00:43:38,864
Will do, boss.

642
00:43:52,544 --> 00:43:54,963
Boss.

643
00:43:57,132 --> 00:43:58,842
What did Petey's mom say?

644
00:43:59,009 --> 00:44:01,178
She hasn't heard anything.

645
00:44:01,345 --> 00:44:03,847
And the sisters,
no one's seen him.

646
00:44:06,224 --> 00:44:07,809
This way.

647
00:44:09,311 --> 00:44:11,313
Thanks.

648
00:44:16,860 --> 00:44:20,489
How's it going, Sal?
He tell you anything?

649
00:44:20,656 --> 00:44:24,951
- Not much.
- Hey, Ivan.

650
00:44:25,118 --> 00:44:27,663
Oh. Hey, buddy.

651
00:44:30,499 --> 00:44:32,459
Hey. Hey.

652
00:44:33,835 --> 00:44:37,172
How you doing in there?

653
00:44:37,339 --> 00:44:40,884
Sal, this defeats the whole fucking
purpose of interrogating him.

654
00:44:41,051 --> 00:44:43,470
How are you gonna get anything
out of him if he's dead?

655
00:44:43,637 --> 00:44:46,431
You brought me all the way
down here for this?

656
00:44:46,598 --> 00:44:48,433
Now you've got to go get
another Russian, all right?

657
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:51,853
( man whispering )

658
00:45:09,913 --> 00:45:12,124
I was hoping I'd see
you again, my son.

659
00:45:12,290 --> 00:45:14,459
You can leave
the burden of life

660
00:45:14,626 --> 00:45:16,211
at the door
of God's house.

661
00:45:16,378 --> 00:45:19,715
You really believe
all this shit, Father?

662
00:45:21,425 --> 00:45:24,136
I mean, if He made good
He also made bad, right?

663
00:45:27,431 --> 00:45:29,516
Do you believe in free will?

664
00:45:29,683 --> 00:45:31,435
The idea that you are free

665
00:45:31,601 --> 00:45:33,770
to make your own choice
in this world.

666
00:45:33,937 --> 00:45:35,355
Of course.

667
00:45:35,522 --> 00:45:38,150
Then how could you make a choice
between right and wrong

668
00:45:38,316 --> 00:45:40,902
if God did not offer
the two extremes?

669
00:45:41,069 --> 00:45:44,573
The path to God is based
upon your ability

670
00:45:44,740 --> 00:45:47,451
as a thinking, feeling being

671
00:45:47,617 --> 00:45:49,494
to make the correct
decisions.

672
00:45:49,661 --> 00:45:52,748
If everything was perfect,
then you wouldn't be on earth.

673
00:45:52,914 --> 00:45:55,917
You'd already be in heaven.

674
00:45:56,084 --> 00:45:58,044
You don't live
in my world, Father.

675
00:45:58,211 --> 00:46:01,757
God can forgive
almost anything, my son.

676
00:46:03,175 --> 00:46:05,927
But you must open
your heart to Him.

677
00:46:16,563 --> 00:46:19,107
( control tower chatter )

678
00:46:44,633 --> 00:46:46,051
Aw, Christ.

679
00:46:46,218 --> 00:46:48,678
Back five fucking minutes,
I got to deal with this asshole.

680
00:46:48,845 --> 00:46:50,305
Vincent:
Hey, Johnny.

681
00:46:50,472 --> 00:46:53,642
Welcome back.
How was Vegas?

682
00:46:53,809 --> 00:46:55,143
- Hot.
- Yeah?

683
00:46:55,310 --> 00:46:56,895
Yeah, what else
you want to know?

684
00:46:57,062 --> 00:47:00,398
-I need to talk to you.
- I heard you got a problem with ghosts.

685
00:47:00,565 --> 00:47:02,150
- Ghosts?
- Yeah.

686
00:47:02,317 --> 00:47:03,693
People that should
be dead, but ain't.

687
00:47:03,860 --> 00:47:06,154
What the fuck did I tell you?
If you're gonna whack someone,

688
00:47:06,321 --> 00:47:08,448
you put two in the head. That way
they can't come back for you.

689
00:47:08,615 --> 00:47:10,325
- Yeah, I know.
- You know, but you didn't do that,

690
00:47:10,492 --> 00:47:12,577
did you?
Now you got problems.

691
00:47:12,744 --> 00:47:14,746
Yeah, I was kind of hoping
you could help me out.

692
00:47:14,913 --> 00:47:16,957
I already helped you out.
I took care of the cops.

693
00:47:17,123 --> 00:47:18,875
Come on, man, you got a cut.

694
00:47:19,042 --> 00:47:21,920
For protection. I ain't going
to war for you, kid.

695
00:47:22,087 --> 00:47:24,840
- I'm not asking you to go to war for--
- You shut the fuck up.

696
00:47:25,006 --> 00:47:29,094
Listen, that friend of yours,
somehow he got Biggs involved.

697
00:47:29,261 --> 00:47:30,887
That changed everything.

698
00:47:31,054 --> 00:47:33,932
This guy don't fuck around.
He's the most ruthless,

699
00:47:34,099 --> 00:47:37,185
cold motherfucker you'll ever meet.
You know what happened

700
00:47:37,352 --> 00:47:39,604
-to the last guy who fucked with him?
- No.

701
00:47:39,771 --> 00:47:41,898
Let's just say he got
a closed-casket funeral.

702
00:47:42,065 --> 00:47:45,318
I can't do anything on this.
You're on your own.

703
00:47:45,485 --> 00:47:47,821
( huffs )
All right.

704
00:47:47,988 --> 00:47:50,031
And I'll tell you something else.

705
00:47:50,198 --> 00:47:53,869
If Biggs reaches out for me,
I'm gonna deliver you.

706
00:47:54,035 --> 00:47:56,454
Just like that?

707
00:47:56,621 --> 00:47:58,957
It's business.

708
00:48:07,547 --> 00:48:09,632
John.

709
00:48:10,884 --> 00:48:13,052
Fuck.

710
00:48:48,421 --> 00:48:50,423
( sniffles )

711
00:49:17,158 --> 00:49:19,953
Sonny?

712
00:49:25,667 --> 00:49:27,877
- Hey.
- I'm sorry.

713
00:49:28,878 --> 00:49:31,255
( Sobs )

714
00:49:47,063 --> 00:49:49,482
He always said that

715
00:49:49,649 --> 00:49:52,402
he'd be okay as long
as you were there.

716
00:49:58,741 --> 00:50:00,660
I'll make it better.

717
00:50:33,026 --> 00:50:34,485
Long time.

718
00:50:35,737 --> 00:50:37,155
Only 13 years.

719
00:50:37,321 --> 00:50:39,032
I can't help you.

720
00:50:39,198 --> 00:50:41,034
I didn't come here
to ask you for your help.

721
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:42,702
Well, then why
don't you get to it?

722
00:50:42,869 --> 00:50:45,163
They only let me out of
my cage for about 15 minutes.

723
00:50:45,329 --> 00:50:48,583
I came to ask

724
00:50:48,750 --> 00:50:51,127
is there anything you
want me to tell your son

725
00:50:51,294 --> 00:50:53,796
before I kill him?

726
00:50:56,841 --> 00:50:59,385
You know, if this glass wasn't
between us I'd break your fucking neck

727
00:50:59,552 --> 00:51:01,262
- for talking to me that way!
- The glass is there.

728
00:51:01,429 --> 00:51:02,847
Hey. Hey!

729
00:51:03,014 --> 00:51:04,640
- That's it, let's go.
- You hear that?

730
00:51:04,807 --> 00:51:07,351
That's it, let's go.
Let's go.

731
00:51:07,518 --> 00:51:09,479
- That's it.
- This crazy motherfucker.

732
00:51:09,645 --> 00:51:11,898
All right, all right.

733
00:51:16,527 --> 00:51:18,863
- Is he here?
- Yeah, but he's busy right--

734
00:51:19,030 --> 00:51:21,074
What the fuck? Mia.

735
00:51:22,408 --> 00:51:24,077
So you gonna be around
later on?

736
00:51:26,829 --> 00:51:28,498
- Yo, Mia, what the fuck?
- Get rid of her.

737
00:51:28,664 --> 00:51:30,500
- Hey.
- What?

738
00:51:30,666 --> 00:51:32,794
Get your shit
and get going.

739
00:51:34,504 --> 00:51:37,548
I guess just go.

740
00:51:37,715 --> 00:51:39,592
You're a fucking asshole.

741
00:51:41,260 --> 00:51:43,930
This is why we're in a world
of shit, Vincent.

742
00:51:44,097 --> 00:51:45,765
Because you're off
fucking around

743
00:51:45,932 --> 00:51:47,350
instead of taking care
of business.

744
00:51:47,517 --> 00:51:49,519
Calm down.
I'm tying up the loose ends.

745
00:51:49,685 --> 00:51:53,439
Loose ends? The only fucking
loose end is Sonny.

746
00:51:53,606 --> 00:51:57,235
I am telling you, Vincent,
do not underestimate him.

747
00:51:57,401 --> 00:51:59,112
I grew up with Sonny.
He's a hothead.

748
00:51:59,278 --> 00:52:01,197
He'll always come through
the front door.

749
00:52:01,364 --> 00:52:03,241
Great, so we'll just wait
for the doorbell to ring, right?

750
00:52:03,407 --> 00:52:05,409
Mia, enough.

751
00:52:21,384 --> 00:52:24,220
Man on P.A.: We need a backup
register open, please.

752
00:52:24,387 --> 00:52:26,681
Backup register open, please.

753
00:52:31,310 --> 00:52:32,812
This what you want?

754
00:52:35,773 --> 00:52:37,942
All cashiers
please come to the front.

755
00:52:38,109 --> 00:52:40,111
All cashiers to the front.

756
00:52:59,751 --> 00:53:02,588
-( knocking )
- It's open, Vincent.

757
00:53:06,008 --> 00:53:07,926
( gasps )

758
00:53:10,095 --> 00:53:12,681
- ( grunts )
- ( screams )

759
00:53:14,433 --> 00:53:16,894
We're done with
the small talk, hmm?

760
00:53:17,060 --> 00:53:18,896
( panting )

761
00:53:19,062 --> 00:53:20,522
Where are my diamonds?

762
00:53:20,689 --> 00:53:22,399
I sold them.

763
00:53:22,566 --> 00:53:25,027
( tisks )
Wrong answer.

764
00:53:25,194 --> 00:53:27,905
(whimpering )

765
00:53:30,073 --> 00:53:32,367
Oh, come on.

766
00:53:37,539 --> 00:53:39,917
( moans )

767
00:53:40,083 --> 00:53:43,378
So this is fun for you?
Huh?

768
00:53:43,545 --> 00:53:45,380
( coughs )

769
00:53:45,547 --> 00:53:47,132
Want to go again?

770
00:53:47,299 --> 00:53:49,718
You have a lot
of nice things here.

771
00:53:49,885 --> 00:53:51,970
( coughs )

772
00:53:55,974 --> 00:53:58,518
( sighs )

773
00:53:58,685 --> 00:54:00,562
Is this all worth it?

774
00:54:03,357 --> 00:54:06,151
Yeah, it is.

775
00:54:06,318 --> 00:54:09,738
Ooh, scary-- blood.

776
00:54:12,574 --> 00:54:14,576
- ( shatters )
- ( whimpers )

777
00:54:17,955 --> 00:54:21,792
Give me my diamonds
and we're done.

778
00:54:21,959 --> 00:54:24,211
Fuck you!

779
00:54:49,945 --> 00:54:51,780
Fuck, man.
I'm starving.

780
00:54:51,947 --> 00:54:54,825
We'll get something
on the way back home.

781
00:54:56,243 --> 00:54:57,869
What you in the mood for?

782
00:54:58,036 --> 00:55:00,038
Shit, like a fucking salad.

783
00:55:00,205 --> 00:55:01,915
What the hell?

784
00:55:02,082 --> 00:55:04,126
What's wrong with you, man?

785
00:55:07,838 --> 00:55:10,549
Yo, Mia.

786
00:55:13,343 --> 00:55:15,762
Mia.

787
00:55:34,781 --> 00:55:36,616
Fuck.

788
00:55:40,996 --> 00:55:43,206
Mia?

789
00:55:50,797 --> 00:55:52,674
Fuck.

790
00:55:59,473 --> 00:56:01,683
Oh fuck.

791
00:56:03,685 --> 00:56:06,480
We've got to get
the fuck out of here, Vince.

792
00:56:06,646 --> 00:56:09,358
We've got to go.

793
00:56:09,524 --> 00:56:11,526
- Let's go.
- Get off me!

794
00:56:11,693 --> 00:56:15,030
I'm sorry, man.
We've got to get the fuck out of here.

795
00:56:15,197 --> 00:56:17,115
Shut up.

796
00:56:28,001 --> 00:56:30,504
I'm sorry, girl.

797
00:56:48,855 --> 00:56:50,399
( muffled screams )

798
00:56:50,565 --> 00:56:53,443
- Biggs: Frankie, how's it going?
- Nothing, boss.

799
00:56:53,610 --> 00:56:55,070
No one's seen
or heard anything.

800
00:56:55,237 --> 00:56:56,988
They must have whacked
the both of them.

801
00:56:57,155 --> 00:56:59,408
Listen, you stupid fucking
Russian son of a bitch,

802
00:56:59,574 --> 00:57:01,743
if you're not gonna plan
on growing gills anytime soon,

803
00:57:01,910 --> 00:57:03,870
I'd suggest you tell the man
what he wants to know.

804
00:57:04,037 --> 00:57:05,997
Black man took the money.

805
00:57:06,164 --> 00:57:08,625
That's all I see.
He took it.

806
00:57:18,009 --> 00:57:21,179
10 bucks says when he comes up
for air he starts screaming about God.

807
00:57:21,346 --> 00:57:22,431
- 20.
- Bet.

808
00:57:22,597 --> 00:57:24,391
Tony:
Bring him up.

809
00:57:24,558 --> 00:57:27,394
( sputtering )

810
00:57:27,561 --> 00:57:29,604
Oh, mother of God!

811
00:57:29,771 --> 00:57:31,857
( laughs )

812
00:57:32,023 --> 00:57:34,943
Hey, Aqualung.

813
00:57:35,110 --> 00:57:37,112
Let me tell you something.
God ain't here.

814
00:57:37,279 --> 00:57:40,198
Okay?
God has left Detroit.

815
00:57:40,365 --> 00:57:42,451
I'm your only god today.

816
00:57:42,617 --> 00:57:45,537
So you'd better tell me
what happened to my boy Petey,

817
00:57:45,704 --> 00:57:47,330
what happened
to the black man,

818
00:57:47,497 --> 00:57:49,708
and what happened
to my fucking money.

819
00:57:49,875 --> 00:57:52,961
- You hear me?
- Man with gun, he took your money.

820
00:57:53,128 --> 00:57:56,673
He took your money.
I tell the truth. I tell the truth!

821
00:57:56,840 --> 00:57:58,800
( laughs )
You're a tough son of a bitch.

822
00:57:58,967 --> 00:58:00,969
Back in the pool, Tony.

823
00:58:07,100 --> 00:58:10,562
- You see that game last night?
- Yeah.

824
00:58:10,729 --> 00:58:13,148
It was a ball. Way outside.

825
00:58:13,315 --> 00:58:14,941
No fucking way
that was a strike.

826
00:58:15,108 --> 00:58:17,486
Ump walked to the plate,
he couldn't see shit.

827
00:58:17,652 --> 00:58:19,279
- They should use that computer box.
- Yeah.

828
00:58:19,446 --> 00:58:22,157
- Way outside.
- Fuckin' ump is like Mr. fucking Magoo.

829
00:58:22,324 --> 00:58:23,950
He can't see anything.

830
00:58:24,993 --> 00:58:26,745
I think he's drowning, boss.

831
00:58:29,289 --> 00:58:30,832
Pull him up.

832
00:58:35,420 --> 00:58:37,672
-( laughs)
-I think he's dead.

833
00:58:37,839 --> 00:58:39,466
I think he was telling the truth.

834
00:58:39,633 --> 00:58:41,009
( laughs )

835
00:58:41,176 --> 00:58:43,845
Listen, come and get me
after you clean this up.

836
00:58:44,012 --> 00:58:47,098
- I'm gonna go get a massage.
- Will do. Let's get him.

837
00:58:48,475 --> 00:58:50,352
( beeps )

838
00:58:54,731 --> 00:58:56,608
( phone ringing )

839
00:58:58,693 --> 00:59:02,364
Yeah? Yeah, I'll be there.
I'm just running a few minutes late.

840
00:59:30,392 --> 00:59:33,270
- I don't like to be kept waiting.
- Whatever.

841
00:59:41,111 --> 00:59:43,321
- You're light.
- it's all there.

842
00:59:43,488 --> 00:59:46,533
No it isn't.
You're light.

843
00:59:46,700 --> 00:59:48,368
What the fuck are you
trying to say, Saunders?

844
00:59:48,535 --> 00:59:50,412
The warden said
the price went up.

845
00:59:50,579 --> 00:59:52,289
No no no.
We had a deal.

846
00:59:52,455 --> 00:59:55,584
Yeah, you paid for a year's
worth of protection.

847
00:59:55,750 --> 00:59:58,420
And now you're gonna
have to pay more.

848
00:59:58,587 --> 01:00:02,173
You want the old man kept
in protective custody?

849
01:00:02,340 --> 01:00:05,427
You pay $100,000 upfront.

850
01:00:05,594 --> 01:00:07,596
This is bullshit.

851
01:00:07,762 --> 01:00:09,431
How long do you think
that old man's

852
01:00:09,598 --> 01:00:11,933
gonna stay in
the general population?

853
01:00:12,100 --> 01:00:15,478
I give him two days before
the brothers cut him a new one.

854
01:00:15,645 --> 01:00:17,814
You want that on your head?

855
01:00:17,981 --> 01:00:22,152
I know you're about family,
so do the right thing, Vince.

856
01:00:22,319 --> 01:00:24,571
Be the good son.

857
01:00:30,368 --> 01:00:33,872
You'd better think this through
before you pull that trigger.

858
01:00:35,165 --> 01:00:36,791
You fuck up with us

859
01:00:36,958 --> 01:00:39,002
and your old man's
a stain on the floor.

860
01:00:39,169 --> 01:00:41,504
Got it?

861
01:00:41,671 --> 01:00:44,591
You got 24 hours.

862
01:00:44,758 --> 01:00:46,926
Or we feed him to the animals.

863
01:00:47,093 --> 01:00:49,220
Get out.

864
01:01:28,301 --> 01:01:30,303
Mia's dead.

865
01:01:37,686 --> 01:01:39,354
What do you want me to say?

866
01:01:39,521 --> 01:01:42,524
Say fucking something.
Anything.

867
01:01:42,691 --> 01:01:43,817
There's nothing to say.

868
01:01:43,983 --> 01:01:45,652
You don't even
want to know how?

869
01:01:45,819 --> 01:01:47,404
It doesn't fucking matter.

870
01:01:47,570 --> 01:01:49,698
You're out there making
mistake after mistake.

871
01:01:49,864 --> 01:01:51,366
And you wonder why she's dead?

872
01:01:51,533 --> 01:01:52,951
What am I doing wrong?

873
01:01:53,118 --> 01:01:55,453
Well, Sonny for one.

874
01:01:57,664 --> 01:01:59,332
How do you know
about Sonny?

875
01:01:59,499 --> 01:02:01,209
He came to visit me.

876
01:02:01,376 --> 01:02:03,128
He sat right where
you're sitting right now

877
01:02:03,294 --> 01:02:06,047
on the other side of this glass
and he looked me in the eye.

878
01:02:06,214 --> 01:02:08,717
Can you do the same?

879
01:02:10,719 --> 01:02:12,345
I'm doing my best.

880
01:02:12,512 --> 01:02:14,097
Well, it's not good enough.

881
01:02:14,264 --> 01:02:16,141
What am I supposed to do?

882
01:02:16,307 --> 01:02:18,309
( sighs )

883
01:02:20,812 --> 01:02:23,732
You really are a little shit.
You know that?

884
01:02:23,898 --> 01:02:26,109
I never thought
I'd have to say that.

885
01:02:26,276 --> 01:02:30,196
Big men make
big moves, Vincent.

886
01:02:30,363 --> 01:02:32,907
Are you a big man?

887
01:03:20,830 --> 01:03:22,791
( groans )

888
01:04:00,119 --> 01:04:01,996
Hey.

889
01:04:33,403 --> 01:04:35,780
Sonny's voice: I knew Biggs
had to be hot on my trail.

890
01:04:35,947 --> 01:04:38,157
You don't take $2 million
from a guy like that

891
01:04:38,324 --> 01:04:40,076
and expect him
to forget about it.

892
01:04:59,747 --> 01:05:02,584
Biggs: No no, you've got
to explain it to me again.

893
01:05:04,210 --> 01:05:06,796
The same guy that
shot you whacked Petey,

894
01:05:06,963 --> 01:05:09,841
took my money, and you want me
to believe that?

895
01:05:10,008 --> 01:05:11,718
Yes.

896
01:05:11,885 --> 01:05:15,179
I told you I was looking for him
when you first grabbed me, remember?

897
01:05:15,346 --> 01:05:17,515
You think I'd be sitting here
if I had your money?

898
01:05:17,682 --> 01:05:19,976
Shit, I ain't crazy.

899
01:05:25,398 --> 01:05:26,816
What?

900
01:05:29,777 --> 01:05:33,281
- Where's my money?
- Vincent has your money.

901
01:05:33,448 --> 01:05:35,700
Your friend Vincent?

902
01:05:35,867 --> 01:05:37,660
Yes.

903
01:05:37,827 --> 01:05:41,122
I know where Vincent is
and I know where the money is.

904
01:05:41,289 --> 01:05:44,208
There's just one problem.
He's got an army around him.

905
01:05:44,375 --> 01:05:47,837
An army of juvenile
delinquents with pistols?

906
01:05:48,004 --> 01:05:50,673
Give me some of your men and we'll go
get the money and bring it right back.

907
01:05:50,840 --> 01:05:54,427
I have a different plan.
Come on.

908
01:06:03,144 --> 01:06:04,604
You all right?

909
01:06:04,771 --> 01:06:06,230
Yeah, I'm cool.

910
01:06:06,397 --> 01:06:08,524
You sure?

911
01:06:10,526 --> 01:06:12,362
All right.

912
01:06:13,863 --> 01:06:15,365
You want a drink?

913
01:06:15,531 --> 01:06:17,575
No thank you.

914
01:06:18,660 --> 01:06:20,411
Might help you relax a little.

915
01:06:24,832 --> 01:06:27,877
Why is it rich people
are always telling me to relax?

916
01:06:29,671 --> 01:06:32,840
'Cause you're young.
You're a young man.

917
01:06:33,007 --> 01:06:36,469
Young guys just want
to run through their life

918
01:06:36,636 --> 01:06:38,054
as fast as they can.

919
01:06:38,221 --> 01:06:41,557
Set it up, knock it down.
Set it up, knock it down.

920
01:06:43,309 --> 01:06:45,436
It's short, real short.

921
01:06:45,603 --> 01:06:48,356
You get to be my age
you see just how short it is.

922
01:06:48,523 --> 01:06:51,567
The older you get, the closer
you get to your death,

923
01:06:51,734 --> 01:06:54,570
you want to relax.
You want to take your time.

924
01:06:56,155 --> 01:06:57,824
There's no rush, kid.

925
01:07:00,994 --> 01:07:02,787
You sure you don't want
that drink?

926
01:07:04,831 --> 01:07:06,833
Yeah, I'll take a drink.

927
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,669
- Bourbon or Scotch?
- Bourbon.

928
01:07:31,691 --> 01:07:33,693
Crap.

929
01:07:38,197 --> 01:07:40,533
You should know I hate
this John R prick.

930
01:07:40,700 --> 01:07:43,828
Just let me do the talking
when we get there, all right?

931
01:08:00,762 --> 01:08:02,472
Hey, you go to church?

932
01:08:04,265 --> 01:08:06,392
I used to.

933
01:08:06,559 --> 01:08:09,437
It got to a point they didn't want
to see me there anymore.

934
01:08:11,981 --> 01:08:14,108
I still help them out
with donations.

935
01:08:15,902 --> 01:08:19,155
I could see those priests
up there sweating.

936
01:08:19,322 --> 01:08:21,407
I made them nervous.

937
01:08:21,574 --> 01:08:23,868
So you believe in God?

938
01:08:24,035 --> 01:08:26,996
I don't know
if I believe in their God.

939
01:08:27,163 --> 01:08:30,792
Yeah, I pray.

940
01:08:32,085 --> 01:08:33,711
I pray every night.

941
01:08:33,878 --> 01:08:37,090
I need a God that's got
a lot of forgiveness.

942
01:08:40,259 --> 01:08:42,261
You're gonna be
all right though.

943
01:08:42,428 --> 01:08:44,138
Don't worry about a thing.

944
01:09:25,304 --> 01:09:28,474
What's the matter, Vince? You look
like you've seen a fucking ghost.

945
01:09:36,649 --> 01:09:39,527
- You know why we're here, John?
- Yeah, I know.

946
01:09:39,694 --> 01:09:41,362
That's the kid
you wanted to see.

947
01:09:42,572 --> 01:09:43,948
Consider him delivered.

948
01:09:44,115 --> 01:09:46,284
Where's my money?

949
01:09:46,450 --> 01:09:47,827
I don't know
what you're talking about.

950
01:09:47,994 --> 01:09:49,495
Give him
his fucking money, Vince.

951
01:09:49,662 --> 01:09:51,873
I don't know what this dude
told you, but it's bullshit.

952
01:09:53,416 --> 01:09:55,501
Last chance.

953
01:09:57,587 --> 01:09:59,380
With all due respect,
I know exactly who you are

954
01:09:59,547 --> 01:10:01,257
and I would never
fucking steal--

955
01:10:01,424 --> 01:10:03,759
John: Jesus Christ!
Take it easy.

956
01:10:03,926 --> 01:10:05,928
Everybody just take it easy.
God damn it.

957
01:10:06,095 --> 01:10:07,680
That's for Petey.

958
01:10:09,640 --> 01:10:12,226
John: You got something
of this man's, you give it to him now.

959
01:10:12,393 --> 01:10:14,020
Or we could all die, John.

960
01:10:18,107 --> 01:10:19,901
(grunts)

961
01:10:20,067 --> 01:10:22,111
( gunshots )

962
01:11:02,276 --> 01:11:04,070
Shit.

963
01:11:14,830 --> 01:11:16,415
Oh! Hey!

964
01:11:27,301 --> 01:11:29,345
- ( tires screech )
-( horn honks )

965
01:11:36,894 --> 01:11:38,604
(grunts)

966
01:11:46,570 --> 01:11:49,115
- Move!
-( pans clatter)

967
01:11:51,867 --> 01:11:54,453
- ( gunshots )
-( people screaming )

968
01:12:09,510 --> 01:12:11,637
Woman:
Watch out.

969
01:12:37,955 --> 01:12:39,790
Fuck!

970
01:12:56,849 --> 01:12:58,934
(dialing )

971
01:13:00,686 --> 01:13:03,481
Saunders, don't you
fucking move my dad.

972
01:13:03,647 --> 01:13:06,025
I've got your money
and I'll be there in an hour.

973
01:13:09,445 --> 01:13:11,405
Going somewhere?

974
01:13:11,572 --> 01:13:13,908
Who the fuck are you?

975
01:13:14,075 --> 01:13:15,534
That's not the topic.

976
01:13:15,701 --> 01:13:17,328
All right,
what is the topic?

977
01:13:17,495 --> 01:13:19,705
Diamonds.
Mm-hmm.

978
01:13:19,872 --> 01:13:22,083
That's right.
Sit down.

979
01:13:22,249 --> 01:13:24,460
Sit down!

980
01:13:27,546 --> 01:13:31,300
You know, in some countries
they cut off the hand that steals.

981
01:13:31,467 --> 01:13:33,511
And you stole from us.

982
01:13:33,677 --> 01:13:36,722
So the way I see it,
you have three choices:

983
01:13:36,889 --> 01:13:39,225
you can fuck around,

984
01:13:39,392 --> 01:13:41,310
in which case I kill you;

985
01:13:41,477 --> 01:13:44,980
you can go for that gun
on the desk

986
01:13:45,147 --> 01:13:47,608
and I kill you;

987
01:13:47,775 --> 01:13:51,529
or you can just
give me the diamonds

988
01:13:51,695 --> 01:13:53,030
and I'll let you disappear.

989
01:13:53,197 --> 01:13:55,074
Yeah right.

990
01:13:55,241 --> 01:13:57,451
Look, my friend,

991
01:13:57,618 --> 01:14:00,913
you're not half as tough
as your little girlfriend.

992
01:14:01,080 --> 01:14:03,416
And at the end

993
01:14:03,582 --> 01:14:05,292
she talked.

994
01:14:07,169 --> 01:14:09,755
So what is it going to be?

995
01:14:09,922 --> 01:14:11,841
She wasn't my girlfriend.

996
01:14:12,007 --> 01:14:14,260
She was my family.

997
01:14:15,886 --> 01:14:17,346
- ( gunshot )
- ( screams )

998
01:14:21,434 --> 01:14:23,853
You got off easy,
motherfucker.

999
01:15:30,836 --> 01:15:32,296
(grunts)

1000
01:15:32,463 --> 01:15:34,798
( groans )

1001
01:15:36,759 --> 01:15:39,178
( Vincent coughing )

1002
01:15:47,311 --> 01:15:50,689
( coughing, sputtering )

1003
01:16:03,953 --> 01:16:05,621
(coughing )

1004
01:16:11,752 --> 01:16:14,004
isn't much fun dying,
huh, Vince?

1005
01:16:15,047 --> 01:16:17,132
Start digging.

1006
01:16:17,299 --> 01:16:20,052
Are you fucking
kidding me, man?

1007
01:16:20,219 --> 01:16:22,596
You want me to dig
my own goddamn grave?

1008
01:16:22,763 --> 01:16:26,267
Don't make me say it again.
I said start digging.

1009
01:16:28,269 --> 01:16:30,437
And make sure it's deep
so you're comfortable.

1010
01:16:30,604 --> 01:16:32,982
How much do you want?

1011
01:16:33,148 --> 01:16:36,527
Huh? How much is my life
worth to you?

1012
01:16:36,694 --> 01:16:40,281
A rat's skin is only worth
something to a rat, Vince.

1013
01:16:40,447 --> 01:16:43,534
Man, bullshit.
Come on.

1014
01:16:43,701 --> 01:16:45,995
Who are you to judge me?

1015
01:16:46,161 --> 01:16:49,415
You ever thought about where
the fuck you'd be without me?

1016
01:16:51,500 --> 01:16:53,752
Yeah, I thought about that

1017
01:16:53,919 --> 01:16:56,171
when I thought I was
taking my last breath.

1018
01:16:56,338 --> 01:16:59,883
Man, who was the one
out there making contacts,

1019
01:17:00,050 --> 01:17:02,094
setting up scores while you
and Dave was getting high?

1020
01:17:02,261 --> 01:17:03,804
Huh? Me.

1021
01:17:03,971 --> 01:17:05,723
Who was the one who
brought you in on shit,

1022
01:17:05,889 --> 01:17:08,559
put money in your pockets,
helped you support your moms?

1023
01:17:08,726 --> 01:17:11,645
- Me!
- That's what I don't understand, man.

1024
01:17:11,812 --> 01:17:13,314
That's what--

1025
01:17:13,480 --> 01:17:15,983
We were family, man.
We were brothers.

1026
01:17:16,150 --> 01:17:19,486
- You, me and Dave--
- Fuck Dave, dude.

1027
01:17:19,653 --> 01:17:21,572
Come on.
That stuttering little bitch.

1028
01:17:21,739 --> 01:17:23,365
This is about us, man.

1029
01:17:23,532 --> 01:17:26,452
How long before him and his big-ass
mouth would have got us all whacked?

1030
01:17:26,619 --> 01:17:29,288
- ( gunshot)
- ( groaning )

1031
01:17:33,083 --> 01:17:35,836
- He was loyal.
- ( groaning )

1032
01:17:39,131 --> 01:17:41,216
He was weak.

1033
01:17:41,383 --> 01:17:43,427
He was my friend.

1034
01:17:43,594 --> 01:17:45,012
Just like you, Vince.
Remember?

1035
01:17:45,179 --> 01:17:47,056
Oh fuck.

1036
01:17:48,307 --> 01:17:51,769
Let me tell you something
as your friend, Sonny.

1037
01:17:51,935 --> 01:17:54,938
Everything you got in this world
is because of me.

1038
01:17:55,105 --> 01:17:58,025
Everything you fucking are
in this world

1039
01:17:58,192 --> 01:18:00,611
is because of me.

1040
01:18:00,778 --> 01:18:02,696
What could you have gotten into

1041
01:18:02,863 --> 01:18:04,740
that was so bad that you
couldn't tell me?

1042
01:18:04,907 --> 01:18:07,701
Huh?
Tell me, I want to know.

1043
01:18:10,412 --> 01:18:12,831
I had your back
since we were kids, man.

1044
01:18:12,998 --> 01:18:15,751
And what do you do? You fucking
shoot me and leave me for dead.

1045
01:18:15,918 --> 01:18:19,088
I had no choice, man.
I was in over my head.

1046
01:18:19,254 --> 01:18:21,674
I couldn't--
I needed all the money.

1047
01:18:21,840 --> 01:18:24,051
They were gonna--
they were gonna kill my father.

1048
01:18:24,218 --> 01:18:27,012
- What?
- They were gonna kill my dad.

1049
01:18:28,555 --> 01:18:32,184
Sonny, you're right, man.

1050
01:18:32,351 --> 01:18:34,853
And I'm sorry.
I should have come to you.

1051
01:18:36,730 --> 01:18:39,274
But you-- you've gotta tell me,
what can I do right now?

1052
01:18:39,441 --> 01:18:42,653
How can I make this right, man?
Tell me what to do.

1053
01:18:44,238 --> 01:18:46,699
You should have thought
about that before.

1054
01:18:48,283 --> 01:18:51,286
You make peace with God,
not me.

1055
01:18:51,453 --> 01:18:53,622
Do it.

1056
01:18:53,789 --> 01:18:56,542
Fucking do it, Sonny.
Shoot my ass.

1057
01:18:56,709 --> 01:18:59,586
'Cause you know what? You ain't nothing
in this world without me, man.

1058
01:18:59,753 --> 01:19:02,589
You shoot me
and we're the same.

1059
01:19:02,756 --> 01:19:04,842
We'll both be gone.

1060
01:19:11,432 --> 01:19:13,267
We're not the same.

1061
01:19:15,561 --> 01:19:17,688
You're fucking pathetic, man.

1062
01:19:19,356 --> 01:19:21,692
Man, fuck you!

1063
01:19:21,859 --> 01:19:23,694
Fuck you, man!

1064
01:19:23,861 --> 01:19:25,320

1065
01:19:25,487 --> 01:19:27,281
I don't need you, man.
You need me.

1066
01:19:27,448 --> 01:19:30,617
You need me!

1067
01:19:30,784 --> 01:19:34,079
I'm gonna walk out of here.
You'll see, man.

1068
01:19:34,246 --> 01:19:37,875
You hear me?
You hear me?!

1069
01:19:38,041 --> 01:19:40,669
Fuck you!

1070
01:19:41,670 --> 01:19:43,172

- ( grunts )
- Yo, man, check it out. Check it out.

1073
01:20:00,355 --> 01:20:02,232
Man: Yo, it was nice
knowing you, buddy.

1074
01:20:02,399 --> 01:20:04,359

- Break it up! Make a hole!

- Back up.
- Get back.

01:20:11,825 --> 01:20:14,286
Get back on the wall.
Get back.

1079
01:20:14,453 --> 01:20:17,206
Let me see your hand.
Get your hand out of there.

1080
01:20:22,044 --> 01:20:23,337
