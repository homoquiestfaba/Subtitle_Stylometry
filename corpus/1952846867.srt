00:29:27,734 --> 00:29:29,861
So what do you say?

537
00:29:29,936 --> 00:29:31,563
Got any appIicants for me?

538
00:29:31,637 --> 00:29:33,104
(Pastor Kevin) Applicants?

539
00:29:33,373 --> 00:29:35,864
How about the whole center.

540
00:29:35,942 --> 00:29:37,569
I'll need to hold interviews, of course.

541
00:29:37,643 --> 00:29:39,338
I want to make sure I give a fair shake

542
00:29:39,412 --> 00:29:41,573
to the least qualified, you know?

543
00:29:41,647 --> 00:29:42,875
I understand, Lorenzo.

544
00:29:42,949 --> 00:29:44,940
God bless you.

545
00:29:44,946 --> 00:29:46,311
(male) Ain't none of my business, huh?

546
00:29:46,381 --> 00:29:47,507
(male) That's right,
none of your business.

547
00:29:47,582 --> 00:29:48,844
(male) Did you look in the 'frigerator.

548
00:29:48,917 --> 00:29:50,475
Look, ain't no refrigerator around here.

549
00:29:50,552 --> 00:29:51,450
I need some milk for the coffee.

550
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,953
- No refrigerator?
- Coffee tastes like motor oil.

551
00:29:53,021 --> 00:29:55,615
What kind of place is
this no refrigerator?

552
00:29:55,691 --> 00:29:58,455
Whoo, you got that right.

553
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:12,402
(female) I had to go to
prison for a while.

554
00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:15,200
I was in the car with my
boyfriend when he went in

555
00:30:15,273 --> 00:30:17,571
and robbed the Iiquor store.

556
00:30:17,642 --> 00:30:21,169
How many children do you have?

557
00:30:21,246 --> 00:30:24,477
Three or four. I'm not sure.

558
00:30:24,549 --> 00:30:26,244
What do you mean you're not sure?

559
00:30:26,317 --> 00:30:28,217
(female) Well, I know I have four.

560
00:30:28,286 --> 00:30:31,881
I just don't know where
one of them is now.

561
00:30:33,424 --> 00:30:35,654
It doesn't look like you
have much work experience.

562
00:30:35,727 --> 00:30:38,594
That would be true, but I'm
willing to learn and work hard.

563
00:30:38,663 --> 00:30:39,823
Excellent. Excellent.

564
00:30:39,898 --> 00:30:41,365
Any office skills?

565
00:30:41,432 --> 00:30:42,831
Like what?

566
00:30:42,901 --> 00:30:44,892
Typing, dictation, that kind of thing?

567
00:30:45,170 --> 00:30:47,798
Uh-uh. No, sir.

568
00:30:47,872 --> 00:30:52,275
So what do you want to do
with your life, Kasheera?

569
00:30:52,343 --> 00:30:53,401
I want to sing.

570
00:30:53,478 --> 00:30:55,537
- Sing?
- Uh-huh.

571
00:30:55,613 --> 00:30:57,911
You're part of the choir at the LEC.

572
00:30:58,183 --> 00:30:58,877
Yes, I am.

573
00:30:58,950 --> 00:31:00,281
(Lorenzo)
I saw you there the other night.

574
00:31:00,351 --> 00:31:02,876
Uh-huh, I'm good.

575
00:31:02,954 --> 00:31:04,182
You like to talk?

576
00:31:04,255 --> 00:31:05,483
- Talk?
- On the phone.

577
00:31:05,557 --> 00:31:07,684
(Kasheera) Oh, I love to talk. Yes, sir.

578
00:31:07,759 --> 00:31:09,249
You're hired.

579
00:31:09,327 --> 00:31:11,420
- I am?
- You start Monday.

580
00:31:11,496 --> 00:31:12,622
(female) What are you looking for?

581
00:31:12,697 --> 00:31:14,631
(male) I need to get some milk, man.

582
00:31:14,699 --> 00:31:16,189
(male) Look in the 'frigerator.

583
00:31:16,267 --> 00:31:17,791
(male) Do you see a refrigerator?

584
00:31:17,869 --> 00:31:21,236
Oh, man, I can't believe this.

585
00:31:21,306 --> 00:31:22,500
Good morning, gents.

586
00:31:22,574 --> 00:31:23,734
Good morning.

587
00:31:23,808 --> 00:31:25,435
God bless you, man.

588
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:28,274
I'm Bob Carmody. How's things?

589
00:31:28,346 --> 00:31:30,541
You got any milk
around here anywhere, man?

590
00:31:30,615 --> 00:31:31,604
Milk?

591
00:31:31,683 --> 00:31:33,344
(male) Yeah, milk, man, for the coffee.

592
00:31:33,418 --> 00:31:34,385
Are you kidding?

593
00:31:34,452 --> 00:31:36,852
All we ever get around
here is that powdered crap.

594
00:31:36,921 --> 00:31:38,513
This? Really?

595
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:40,217
Oh, man.

596
00:31:40,291 --> 00:31:42,486
Hey, you got some of that
other stuff, you know,

597
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:44,687
it's kind of like milk but not really.

598
00:31:44,762 --> 00:31:47,230
It's in a little packet
and you always spill some

599
00:31:47,298 --> 00:31:48,560
'cause it's so small.

600
00:31:48,633 --> 00:31:49,759
What do they call it?

601
00:31:49,834 --> 00:31:51,267
- Half and half.
- Yeah.

602
00:31:51,336 --> 00:31:52,963
No, I wish. I mean--

603
00:31:53,238 --> 00:31:54,603
Yeah, me too.

604
00:31:54,672 --> 00:31:57,368
So where you guys from anyway?

605
00:31:57,442 --> 00:31:58,739
The LEC.

606
00:31:58,810 --> 00:32:00,869
What is that some sort
of division of welfare

607
00:32:00,945 --> 00:32:02,242
or something?

608
00:32:02,313 --> 00:32:05,510
(male) Hey, hey, I ain't
on no welfare, all right?

609
00:32:05,583 --> 00:32:07,210
I didn't say you were.

610
00:32:07,285 --> 00:32:09,947
And don't be all up in
my face talking about

611
00:32:10,021 --> 00:32:11,955
being on welfare.

612
00:32:12,023 --> 00:32:13,752
You don't even know me like that, man.

613
00:32:13,825 --> 00:32:15,952
I never said you were on welfare.

614
00:32:16,027 --> 00:32:20,430
Have you ever been on welfare?

615
00:32:20,498 --> 00:32:25,697
Do you even know what
it's like to be on welfare?

616
00:32:25,770 --> 00:32:29,297
Do you know anybody on welfare?

617
00:32:29,374 --> 00:32:33,435
Have you ever given to a welfare fund?

618
00:32:33,511 --> 00:32:35,445
I didn't think so.

619
00:32:37,048 --> 00:32:41,348
So all these people,
they come from the LEC?

620
00:32:41,419 --> 00:32:43,979
I think they do.

621
00:32:44,055 --> 00:32:46,683
So just what is the LEC?

622
00:32:46,758 --> 00:32:48,453
Hey, AIex, get on up here, man.

623
00:32:48,526 --> 00:32:50,756
I'm saving you a place.

624
00:32:50,828 --> 00:32:52,523
(Alex) Life Enrichment Center.

625
00:32:52,597 --> 00:32:54,360
Hey, you got any donuts down there?

626
00:32:54,432 --> 00:32:55,956
Bring me a couple donuts, man.

627
00:32:56,034 --> 00:32:57,626
Life Enrichment Center?

628
00:32:57,702 --> 00:32:59,363
What donuts?

629
00:32:59,437 --> 00:33:01,268
What's the Life Enrichment Center?

630
00:33:01,339 --> 00:33:03,830
Hey, look, all I'm doing is
trying to get a job, all right?

631
00:33:03,908 --> 00:33:07,708
What about the donuts?
I need some donuts.

632
00:33:07,779 --> 00:33:09,906
Excuse me, brother man.

633
00:33:09,981 --> 00:33:11,448
God bless you.

634
00:33:11,516 --> 00:33:16,419
Can you spare some change?

635
00:33:16,487 --> 00:33:19,388
I only have enough for
my peanut butter crackers.

636
00:33:19,457 --> 00:33:21,049
Oh.

637
00:33:21,326 --> 00:33:23,886
But I could share some of my
crackers with you, if you want.

638
00:33:23,961 --> 00:33:25,690
Oh, no thank you.

639
00:33:25,763 --> 00:33:27,628
I appreciate it, but no thank you.

640
00:33:27,699 --> 00:33:30,031
I'm allergic to peanut butter.

641
00:33:30,101 --> 00:33:33,366
You know, lactose intolerant,
kind of swells my ankles up.

642
00:33:33,438 --> 00:33:36,464
Yeah, my nose starts running
and my ear lobes get--

643
00:33:36,541 --> 00:33:39,476
(Lorenzo) Okay, who's next?

644
00:33:40,878 --> 00:33:43,938
Good morning, sir.

645
00:33:49,754 --> 00:33:51,813
What do you need a job for?

646
00:33:51,889 --> 00:33:54,858
I'm currently unemployed.

647
00:33:54,926 --> 00:33:58,362
(Lorenzo) PhD in Romance languages.

648
00:33:58,429 --> 00:34:00,590
Professor of English Literature
in Medieval History

649
00:34:00,665 --> 00:34:02,565
at Weimar Mary College.

650
00:34:02,633 --> 00:34:04,601
Adviser to the Bush Administration?

651
00:34:04,669 --> 00:34:07,001
That was Bush the father.

652
00:34:07,071 --> 00:34:10,438
Father Bush.

653
00:34:10,508 --> 00:34:12,738
What happened?

654
00:34:12,810 --> 00:34:14,038
I beg your pardon?

655
00:34:14,112 --> 00:34:18,378
How'd you end up at the LEC?

656
00:34:20,551 --> 00:34:27,855
On a daily basis, and for
many months, years in fact.

657
00:34:27,925 --> 00:34:29,756
You're a wino?

658
00:34:29,827 --> 00:34:34,093
In so many words, but reformed.

659
00:34:34,165 --> 00:34:35,894
Ever done any bill collecting?

660
00:34:35,967 --> 00:34:38,094
It doesn't look like it.

661
00:34:38,169 --> 00:34:40,967
(male) Not exactly,
but given the breadth of my

662
00:34:41,038 --> 00:34:44,132
interdisciplinary studies
and teaching experience,

663
00:34:44,409 --> 00:34:47,970
I don't think it will be difficult.

664
00:34:48,045 --> 00:34:51,811
What languages do you speak?

665
00:34:51,883 --> 00:34:54,113
The Romance languages, of course.

666
00:34:54,185 --> 00:34:55,618
Of course.

667
00:34:55,686 --> 00:34:59,087
(male)
And a smattering of several others.

668
00:34:59,157 --> 00:35:02,558
German, Swahili, Russian.

669
00:35:02,627 --> 00:35:06,620
- Russian?
- Yes, Russian.

670
00:35:06,697 --> 00:35:09,962
- Bahasa Indonesian, Tagalog.
- You're hired.

671
00:35:10,034 --> 00:35:11,626
I'm--I'm--

672
00:35:11,702 --> 00:35:13,465
(Lorenzo) Bye-bye. Who's next?

673
00:35:13,538 --> 00:35:16,939
I was told that this was
a training opportunity?

674
00:35:17,008 --> 00:35:20,068
You heard correctly.

675
00:35:20,144 --> 00:35:23,705
It might lead to full-time employment?

676
00:35:23,781 --> 00:35:25,450
Anything's possible, professor.

677
00:35:25,583 --> 00:35:27,813
Let's just take things
one day at a time, shall we?

678
00:35:27,885 --> 00:35:30,046
Send in the next guy.

679
00:35:30,121 --> 00:35:32,783
What'd you find out?

680
00:35:32,857 --> 00:35:38,693
For the moment, I have
more questions than answers.

681
00:35:38,763 --> 00:35:43,826
Knowing Lorenzo, however,
even a good deed has

682
00:35:43,901 --> 00:35:46,597
an ulterior motive.

683
00:35:47,765 --> 00:35:49,357

689

Come on, church.

690
00:36:06,684 --> 00:36:08,914
Give the Lord some praise in here.

691
00:36:08,986 --> 00:36:10,749
Give him some praise tonight.

692
00:36:10,821 --> 00:36:12,448
Thank you, choir.

693
00:36:12,523 --> 00:36:13,990
Thank you very much.

694
00:36:14,058 --> 00:36:15,992
Oh, yes.

695
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:20,895
Welcome, welcome,
welcome to our Thursday night service.

696
00:36:20,965 --> 00:36:25,561
Now we have some exciting
news for you this evening.

697
00:36:25,636 --> 00:36:28,537
I want to see the hands
of everyone who went

698
00:36:28,606 --> 00:36:33,566
to the Lump Sum Collection
Agency earlier today.

699
00:36:33,644 --> 00:36:34,906
Let me see the hands.

700
00:36:34,979 --> 00:36:36,378
Oh, Wanda, look. That's great.

701
00:36:36,447 --> 00:36:38,312
That's fantastic.

702
00:36:38,382 --> 00:36:43,718
Now, we have with us
tonight the co-owner.

703
00:36:43,788 --> 00:36:45,756
Co-owner, is that right?

704
00:36:45,823 --> 00:36:49,691
The co-owner of the Lump Sum
Collection Agency,

705
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:54,527
Lorenzo Adams, has agreed
to give each of our applicants

706
00:36:54,598 --> 00:36:57,829
2 weeks of on-the-job training.

707
00:36:57,902 --> 00:37:01,770
And get this, those 2 weeks
of on-the-job training

708
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:05,331
could lead to full-time employment.

709
00:37:05,409 --> 00:37:07,969
Oh, come on people. Come on.

710
00:37:08,045 --> 00:37:10,570
My, my, my.

711
00:37:10,648 --> 00:37:13,583
Can I get an amen?
[laughing]

712
00:37:14,552 --> 00:37:18,454
All right now, Lorenzo, come on up here

713
00:37:18,522 --> 00:37:20,752

[falling down stairs] Boom! Boom! Boom!

891
00:48:34,512 --> 00:48:35,877
Ah!

892
00:48:35,947 --> 00:48:38,415
Oh.

893
00:48:38,483 --> 00:48:40,576
Ah.

894
00:48:40,652 --> 00:48:42,620
Oh.

895
00:48:42,687 --> 00:48:45,087
(Lorenzo) I know this is a shock
for everyone, but please,

896
00:48:45,156 --> 00:48:46,987
we really need to try
and handle ourselves

897
00:48:47,058 --> 00:48:50,152
in a more professional manner, okay?

898
00:48:50,228 --> 00:48:52,594
Now finish clearing out your desks

899
00:48:52,664 --> 00:48:57,829
and come back in 2 weeks
for your final pay checks.

900
00:48:57,902 --> 00:48:59,961
That is all.

901
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:05,175
(Bob) Milly. Milly.

902
00:49:06,811 --> 00:49:09,177
Iggy, come into my office.

903
00:49:11,816 --> 00:49:13,545
Iggy.

904
00:49:13,618 --> 00:49:17,918
Watch your-- Move my arm.

905
00:49:17,989 --> 00:49:22,085
Iggy, where you going, Iggy?

906
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:24,492
I'm sorry, Bob.

907
00:49:24,562 --> 00:49:26,496
(Bob) Iggy.

908
00:49:28,032 --> 00:49:30,694
(female)
Don't move. Can you move your head?

909
00:49:30,768 --> 00:49:32,702
(Bob) It hurts.

910
00:49:33,410 --> 00:49:35,344
(Lorenzo)
So anyway, today at the agency,

911
00:49:35,412 --> 00:49:37,243
we set all kinds of records.

912
00:49:37,314 --> 00:49:38,838
It was an unbelievable day.

913
00:49:38,915 --> 00:49:41,475
You're not--hey, what
do you got there, big guy?

914
00:49:41,551 --> 00:49:42,984
One of your favorites.

915
00:49:43,053 --> 00:49:44,987
Fettuccine alfredo!

916
00:49:45,055 --> 00:49:46,682
Yummy.

917
00:49:46,757 --> 00:49:48,884
You're gonna love this.

918
00:49:48,959 --> 00:49:55,364
Cilantro and other special
ingredients, only known to me.

919
00:49:55,432 --> 00:49:56,763
You're the best, Omar.

920
00:49:56,833 --> 00:49:58,596
Yes.

921
00:49:58,669 --> 00:50:03,299
Nope, down. Good.

922
00:50:03,373 --> 00:50:06,308
Give me your hands.

923
00:50:12,082 --> 00:50:16,018
God, thank you for the food.

924
00:50:16,086 --> 00:50:22,958
Help Lorenzo get the money
that he needs.

925
00:50:23,026 --> 00:50:25,586
In Jesus' name, Amen.

926
00:50:27,497 --> 00:50:32,402
Hey, can I have some of that?

927
00:50:32,402 --> 00:50:35,701
Welcome to your first day
on the job, folks.

928
00:50:35,772 --> 00:50:39,401
This handsome gentleman right
here is Ignatius Pendergas

929
00:50:39,476 --> 00:50:41,740
or Iggy for short.

930
00:50:41,812 --> 00:50:43,575
He'll be walking you through
the day today, helping you

931
00:50:43,647 --> 00:50:45,979
with the ins and outs of
the computer software

932
00:50:46,049 --> 00:50:49,416
and telephone scripts
you'll need to memorize.

933
00:50:49,486 --> 00:50:53,786
Over here is Omar Adams, my nephew.

934
00:50:53,857 --> 00:50:55,688
Just returned from another tour of duty

935
00:50:55,759 --> 00:50:59,593
with the U.S. Army, learning
to reintegrate into society

936
00:50:59,663 --> 00:51:03,622
after experiencing fierce
battles involving

937
00:51:03,700 --> 00:51:10,936
vicious hand-to-hand combat
and not a few fatalities.

938
00:51:11,007 --> 00:51:13,999
Don't mess with him.

939
00:51:14,077 --> 00:51:19,014
I'm Lorenzo Adams.
I guess you know that by now.

940
00:51:19,082 --> 00:51:23,917
And I'll be directing operations
from my command post over there.

941
00:51:24,955 --> 00:51:27,947
Now, let's be clear
about something, folks.

942
00:51:28,024 --> 00:51:31,357
This is, first and foremost, a business.

943
00:51:31,428 --> 00:51:35,660
Sometimes business is rough.
Sometimes business is hardball.

944
00:51:35,732 --> 00:51:37,962
Collections can truly be
a classic struggle

945
00:51:38,034 --> 00:51:40,764
between the forces of good and evil.

946
00:51:40,837 --> 00:51:42,498
- Amen.
- Amen, sister.

947
00:51:42,572 --> 00:51:45,473
Shout for glory because
with God on our side,

948
00:51:45,542 --> 00:51:48,841
we will prevail over Ramoth-gilead.

949
00:51:48,912 --> 00:51:52,473
Now sure, we can all relate to
the poor schmoe who gets himself

950
00:51:52,549 --> 00:51:53,880
into a financeable bind.

951
00:51:53,950 --> 00:51:56,418
But, people,
we're here to collect money.

952
00:51:56,486 --> 00:51:58,784
I'll say that again, collect money,

953
00:51:58,855 --> 00:52:00,152
collect hard, collect fast.

954
00:52:00,424 --> 00:52:01,686
Never give up. Never give in.

955
00:52:01,758 --> 00:52:04,886
And think about it, you're
doing your company a service.

956
00:52:04,961 --> 00:52:07,521
You're doing your nation's
economy a service.

957
00:52:07,597 --> 00:52:09,462
You're doing your family a service.

958
00:52:09,533 --> 00:52:11,558
You're even helping the poor
schmoe who owes money

959
00:52:11,635 --> 00:52:13,569
in the first place
'cause at the end of the day,

960
00:52:13,637 --> 00:52:16,504
you're helping him get
the monkey of debt off his back.

961
00:52:16,573 --> 00:52:18,541
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

962
00:52:18,608 --> 00:52:22,544
Ah! I--I love this job.

963
00:52:22,612 --> 00:52:25,843
Okay, let's go over how this works.

964
00:52:25,916 --> 00:52:29,113
Iggy, I need your help here
on the bridge.

965
00:52:29,186 --> 00:52:35,489
Now debtor X originally owed
$1,200 after medicaid paid

966
00:52:35,559 --> 00:52:37,049
its portion of the bill.

967
00:52:37,127 --> 00:52:40,585
Debtor X has successfully
resisted all efforts

968
00:52:40,664 --> 00:52:43,400
by the hospital to collect
on the amount due.

969
00:52:43,628 --> 00:52:47,655
Enter Lump Sum Collection
Agency along with

970
00:52:47,732 --> 00:52:51,566
the rising stars of the LEC.

971
00:52:51,636 --> 00:52:54,901
For the next 2 weeks only,
we're gonna offer debtor X

972
00:52:54,972 --> 00:52:58,408
the opportunity of satisfying
his debt for only pennies

973
00:52:58,476 --> 00:52:59,943
on the dollar.

974
00:53:00,011 --> 00:53:01,069
That's right.

975
00:53:01,346 --> 00:53:03,371
We're gonna offer debtor X
the opportunity of satisfying

976
00:53:03,448 --> 00:53:06,315
his debt for only 40 cents
on the dollar,

977
00:53:06,384 --> 00:53:10,787
or in this case, $480 instead of $1,200.

978
00:53:10,855 --> 00:53:13,983
And very important,
if debtor X actually comes

979
00:53:14,058 --> 00:53:16,322
into the office and pays in cash,

980
00:53:16,394 --> 00:53:20,797
we're gonna take an additional 10% off!

981
00:53:20,865 --> 00:53:25,097
Any questions? Good.

982
00:53:25,370 --> 00:53:26,962
Let's weigh anchor, Iggy.

983
00:53:27,038 --> 00:53:29,472
Let's get started.

984
00:53:36,781 --> 00:53:41,445
Kasheera, can I see you in
my office here just a second?

985
00:53:44,422 --> 00:53:46,686
What did I do now?

986
00:53:49,527 --> 00:53:51,051
Come on in here. Have a seat.

987
00:53:51,129 --> 00:53:53,029
Have a seat.

988
00:53:53,097 --> 00:53:54,928
I need you to take dictation.

989
00:53:54,999 --> 00:53:56,626
I've never done that before,
Mr. Lorenzo.

990
00:53:56,701 --> 00:53:58,430
Don't worry, I'll show you the ropes.

991
00:53:58,503 --> 00:54:02,599
Okay.

992
00:54:02,673 --> 00:54:05,733
Ah! Ah, ah, oh.

993
00:54:05,810 --> 00:54:06,970
You all right, Mr. Lorenzo?

994
00:54:07,044 --> 00:54:08,807
No, a football injury, never mind.

995
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:09,642
I just need to lay down.

996
00:54:09,714 --> 00:54:12,649
Okay.

997
00:54:12,717 --> 00:54:14,582
Mr. Lorenzo.

998
00:54:14,652 --> 00:54:17,780
All right, just right here.
I'm gonna just lay down.

999
00:54:17,855 --> 00:54:19,117
Go ahead. Go ahead.

1000
00:54:19,190 --> 00:54:20,418
Have a seat.

1001
00:54:20,491 --> 00:54:23,392
Can you just help me
put my feet up there?

1002
00:54:23,461 --> 00:54:27,727
Oh, yeah, that's better.

1003
00:54:27,799 --> 00:54:29,892
Now, where was I?

1004
00:54:29,967 --> 00:54:31,491
You wanted me to take dictation.

1005
00:54:31,569 --> 00:54:32,729
(Lorenzo) I remember now.

1006
00:54:32,804 --> 00:54:34,066
Should I go get my writing pad?

1007
00:54:34,138 --> 00:54:36,572
Maybe later.

1008
00:54:36,641 --> 00:54:38,040
- Boss!
- What?

1009
00:54:38,109 --> 00:54:39,133
We got a problem!

1010
00:54:39,210 --> 00:54:41,508
I thought I hired you
to handle problems!

1011
00:54:41,579 --> 00:54:44,707
(Iggy) Some of these people,
they can't even read.

1012
00:54:44,782 --> 00:54:47,683
Oh, I can't believe that.

1013
00:54:47,752 --> 00:54:53,782
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

1014
00:54:53,858 --> 00:54:56,190
Thanks.

1015

Yes, sir.

1017
00:55:00,231 --> 00:55:01,698
Go help Iggy.

1018
00:55:01,766 --> 00:55:03,666
We need a crash course
for everyone who can't read.

1019
00:55:03,734 --> 00:55:06,897
The basics and get the
professor on it right away.

And see who's got a good memory.

1022
00:55:10,942 --> 00:55:15,470
Maybe they can't read, but
they can memorize the script.

00:57:18,774 --> 00:57:22,039
Hey, how you guys doing?

1067
00:57:23,112 --> 00:57:24,807
First day on the job?

1068
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:26,711
First day.

1069
00:57:26,782 --> 00:57:27,908
Well, how'd it go?

1070
00:57:27,983 --> 00:57:30,144
I mean, is Lorenzo behaving himself?

1071
00:57:30,219 --> 00:57:30,947
It went great, man.

1072
00:57:31,020 --> 00:57:33,750
I collected on nine different accounts.

1073
00:57:33,823 --> 00:57:34,881
I did 12.

1074
00:57:34,957 --> 00:57:36,015
Wait, wait, wait a minute.

1075
00:57:36,091 --> 00:57:40,528
You got 12 different
clients to pay their bills?

1076
00:57:40,596 --> 00:57:43,121
Yeah, that's right.

1077
00:57:43,199 --> 00:57:44,461
You got nine?

1078
00:57:44,533 --> 00:57:46,797
Yes, sir.

1079
00:57:46,869 --> 00:57:48,996
And you?

1080
00:57:49,071 --> 00:57:50,629
Over 20.

1081
00:57:50,706 --> 00:57:54,164
Ha, ha, ha!

1082
00:57:54,243 --> 00:57:58,737
How'd you do that?

1083
00:57:58,814 --> 00:58:00,941
(Alex) We did our job, that's all.

1084
00:58:01,016 --> 00:58:02,540
We got trained, man.

1085
00:58:02,618 --> 00:58:04,677
Yeah.

1086
00:58:04,753 --> 00:58:06,050
Well, I've been in
the collections business

1087
00:58:06,121 --> 00:58:10,148
for 16 years, and the most I
ever collected in a single day

1088
00:58:10,226 --> 00:58:13,127
was on 10 accounts.

1089
00:58:13,195 --> 00:58:15,060
Well, God bless you.

1090
00:58:15,130 --> 00:58:17,496
Hey, is this the help wanted section

1091
00:58:17,566 --> 00:58:18,931
that you're reading over here?

1092
00:58:19,001 --> 00:58:21,469
'Cause I--no, that's crosswords.

1093
00:58:21,537 --> 00:58:22,128
I like that too.

1094
00:58:22,204 --> 00:58:24,832
You finished with this, huh? Yeah.

1095
00:58:25,808 --> 00:58:27,139
Oh, he need training.

1096
00:58:27,209 --> 00:58:29,011
Yeah, he needs some training.

1097
00:58:29,211 --> 00:58:32,146
I was gonna help you on number 27 down.

1098
00:58:32,214 --> 00:58:33,582
I knew the answer.

1099
00:58:38,830 --> 00:58:41,924
Look what the cat dragged in.

1100
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:43,729
Good evening, gentlemen.

1101
00:58:43,802 --> 00:58:45,963
Is there room at the table?

1102
00:58:47,406 --> 00:58:50,273
Lorenzo, Lorenzo.
[laughing]

1103
00:58:50,342 --> 00:58:51,707
Fancy meeting you here.

1104
00:58:51,777 --> 00:58:53,506
(Lorenzo) Do I know you?

1105
00:58:53,578 --> 00:58:55,478
Does he know me?

1106
00:58:55,547 --> 00:58:57,037
- You look familiar.
- Well, whatever.

1107
00:58:57,316 --> 00:58:58,374
Scoot over.

1108
00:58:58,450 --> 00:58:59,576
(male) Come on have a seat, man.

1109
00:58:59,651 --> 00:59:00,675
Deal me in.

1110
00:59:00,752 --> 00:59:04,415
(male) Off with the dresses
and on with the suits.

1111
00:59:04,489 --> 00:59:06,787
Oh, yeah.

1112
00:59:06,858 --> 00:59:10,021
(Frankie) All right, fellas,
all right, fellas, here we go.

1113
00:59:10,095 --> 00:59:12,996
(male) Shoe shine, shoe shine,
come on buff 'em up.

1114
00:59:13,065 --> 00:59:15,795
Shine 'em up.

1115
00:59:20,472 --> 00:59:23,305
I see that 50 and I'll raise you 100.

1116
00:59:23,375 --> 00:59:27,402
Come on, come on, the inhale
to the exhale all day long.

1117
00:59:27,479 --> 00:59:29,811
(Lorenzo) I got it right here, man.

1118
00:59:29,881 --> 00:59:31,712
(Frankie)
You stiff now, getting stiff, fellas.

1119
00:59:31,783 --> 00:59:34,547
(male) Ain't no time for
tremblin' now, gentlemen.

1120
00:59:34,619 --> 00:59:37,417
(Lorenzo) Come on, put it in, put it in.

1121
00:59:37,489 --> 00:59:39,320
I'm out.

1122
00:59:39,391 --> 00:59:42,019
(Lorenzo) There we are, gentlemen.

1123
00:59:42,094 --> 00:59:43,391
Thank you very much.

1124
00:59:43,462 --> 00:59:44,724
Thank you. Thank you.

1125
00:59:44,796 --> 00:59:45,922
(Frankie) Don't get too lucky, Lorenzo.

1126
00:59:45,997 --> 00:59:46,986
Why?

1127
00:59:47,065 --> 00:59:49,431
(Frankie) You gonna guard your money
or you gonna deal?

1128
00:59:49,501 --> 00:59:50,627
I'll deal. I'll deal.

1129
00:59:50,702 --> 00:59:51,794
(male) Don't let it go to your head.

1130
00:59:51,870 --> 00:59:56,671
(male) Man, the name might change,
but the game is still the same.

1131
00:59:56,742 --> 01:00:00,007
(Lorenzo) What am I gonna do
with all this money?

1132
01:00:00,078 --> 01:00:02,842
I have no idea.

1133
01:00:02,914 --> 01:00:09,547
(Lorenzo) I think I'll buy me an island
somewhere off the map.

1134
01:00:12,524 --> 01:00:19,828
(Frankie) Okay, I'm gonna see that
500 and raise you 2 grand.

1135
01:00:24,469 --> 01:00:30,533
I'll see that and raise you 3 grand.

1136
01:00:30,609 --> 01:00:32,406
(male) Gettin' to be some crazy money.

1137
01:00:32,477 --> 01:00:33,967
And change.

1138
01:00:34,045 --> 01:00:35,979
[laughing] Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

1139
01:00:36,047 --> 01:00:41,713
Lorenzo, Lorenzo, always the optimist.

1140
01:00:41,787 --> 01:00:44,017
I call.

1141
01:00:44,089 --> 01:00:47,718
There you go.

1142
01:00:47,793 --> 01:00:49,158
(Frankie) Read 'em and weep.

1143
01:00:49,428 --> 01:00:53,524
Full house beats a straight.

1144
01:00:53,598 --> 01:00:56,465
Thanks for stopping by though,
and I'll see you

1145
01:00:56,535 --> 01:00:58,059
in less than 2 weeks.

1146
01:00:58,136 --> 01:00:59,535
Don't be late.

1147
01:00:59,604 --> 01:01:02,732
And whatever you do, don't be short.

1148
01:01:03,175 --> 01:01:05,609
(male)
You got a card up your sleeve, sucker.

1149
01:01:05,677 --> 01:01:07,406
Easy guys. Calm down.

1150
01:01:07,479 --> 01:01:08,104
Ta bien. Ta bien.

1151
01:01:08,180 --> 01:01:09,807
(male) Let's be easy, gentlemen.

1152
01:01:09,881 --> 01:01:12,679
Why don't you get your hands
off me, and we'll inspect

1153
01:01:12,751 --> 01:01:16,050
my wardrobe in a more
gentlemanly fashion.

1154
01:01:16,121 --> 01:01:18,885
Carmine, help me w'my coat.

1155
01:01:33,038 --> 01:01:34,801
Good night, gentlemen.

1156
01:01:34,873 --> 01:01:38,138
Now how we gonna leave this?

1157
01:01:41,713 --> 01:01:42,975
I'm outta here.

1158
01:01:43,048 --> 01:01:44,208
Yeah, good riddance.

1159
01:01:44,483 --> 01:01:46,713
Oscar, let's roll.

1160
01:01:46,785 --> 01:01:48,719
Watch your back, Mr. Cholo.

1161
01:01:48,787 --> 01:01:52,484
Okay, gentlemen, now that
the weak ones are gone,

1162
01:01:52,557 --> 01:01:54,718
let's play some cards.

1163
01:01:54,793 --> 01:01:56,727
- Let's play.
- I'm in.

1164
01:02:01,600 --> 01:02:02,760
(Lorenzo) Where are we going?

1165
01:02:02,835 --> 01:02:04,325
(Omar) We're going home.

1166
01:02:04,403 --> 01:02:06,064
I don't want to go home.

1167
01:02:06,339 --> 01:02:07,829
You need to sleep it off.

1168
01:02:07,907 --> 01:02:11,308
I need to die, tonight.

1169
01:02:11,377 --> 01:02:13,538
Would you kill me please?

1170
01:02:13,612 --> 01:02:16,012
'Cause I'm drunk.

1171
01:02:16,082 --> 01:02:17,481
Come on.

1172
01:02:17,550 --> 01:02:19,745
I'm by a riverside.

1173
01:02:19,819 --> 01:02:25,553
Put me in a plastic bag
just like a pussy cat.

1174
01:02:25,624 --> 01:02:29,720
Throw me in, just like
I tried to do to you.

1175
01:02:29,795 --> 01:02:33,458
I know. Let's go home.

1176
01:02:40,506 --> 01:02:43,407
You know what Hell is?

1177
01:02:43,476 --> 01:02:45,740
Hell is other people.

1178
01:02:51,484 --> 01:02:53,349
[knocking on door]

1179
01:02:53,419 --> 01:02:54,818
Come in.

1180
01:02:54,887 --> 01:02:56,616
You wanted to see me, sir?

1181
01:02:56,689 --> 01:02:59,715
Yeah, come in and shut the door.

1182
01:03:02,995 --> 01:03:04,690
I just got a telegram from Stan.

1183
01:03:04,764 --> 01:03:08,757
We're authorized to offer
30 cents on the dollar.

1184
01:03:08,834 --> 01:03:11,098
Thirty cents on the dollar?

1185
01:03:11,170 --> 01:03:13,001
Twenty cents on the dollar
if the client comes

1186
01:03:13,072 --> 01:03:15,905
into the office in person and pays cash.

1187
01:03:15,975 --> 01:03:17,966
Wow, that's something.

1188
01:03:18,043 --> 01:03:19,374
Yeah.

1189
01:03:19,445 --> 01:03:21,106
Stan wants all the hospital
accounts wrapped up

1190
01:03:21,180 --> 01:03:22,670
before he gets back.

1191
01:03:22,748 --> 01:03:24,511
Must be having a great time.

1192
01:03:24,583 --> 01:03:27,518
That or the sun went
through his head, right?

1193
01:03:30,556 --> 01:03:31,818
I'm sorry.

1194
01:03:31,891 --> 01:03:34,018
I need every hand on deck.

1195
01:03:34,093 --> 01:03:36,823
Aye-aye, sir.

1196
01:03:45,871 --> 01:03:50,433
(Lorenzo) Because of eminent deadlines,
over which I have no control,

1197
01:03:50,509 --> 01:03:52,568
starting today we're gonna
split you into two groups

1198
01:03:52,645 --> 01:03:55,808
and extend the workday to
12 hours for each group.

1199
01:03:55,881 --> 01:03:57,109
We'll man the phones around the clock

1200
01:03:57,183 --> 01:03:58,844
'til every account is settled.

1201
01:03:58,918 --> 01:04:00,909
We'll fight them on the seas
and in the oceans.

1202
01:04:00,986 --> 01:04:02,977
We'll fight them on the fields
and on the hills.

1203
01:04:03,055 --> 01:04:05,888
I ain't working more than 8 hours.

1204
01:04:05,958 --> 01:04:07,050
Who said that?

1205
01:04:07,126 --> 01:04:08,150
God bless you, Lorenzo.

1206
01:04:08,227 --> 01:04:09,455
(Lorenzo) I make the rules here, sailor.

Now, who wants to work the day shift?

1209
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:16,092
Who wants to work the night shift?

1210
01:04:16,168 --> 01:04:19,001
It makes no difference to me
because I'm gonna be here 24/7,
