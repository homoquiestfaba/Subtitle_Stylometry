wanders into a dark cave
that he's never been in before?

70
00:05:10,243 --> 00:05:15,237
Hell no! That's because
his instincts tell him that it's wrong.

71
00:05:16,249 --> 00:05:19,446
He needs his instincts to survive.

72
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:22,488
He's always listening to them.

00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:29,120
if your instincts are telling you
this is wrong...

75

get out of the dark cave, brother.

87

back when I was getting married.

about getting married.

happened to me.

I fucking... I love being married.
I fucking love it, dude!

My wife is my life. And you know
what the secret to marriage is?

92
00:06:19,645 --> 00:06:22,808
- What's that?
- You get out of it what you put into it.

93
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:24,816
Exactly what you put into it.

94
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:27,978
If your life in marriage becomes some
sort of horrible Stephen King novel...

95
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:31,251
it is because you yourself
are Dolores Claiborne.

96
00:06:31,324 --> 00:06:35,090
- That's cool.
- Guys have this weird thing about marriage.

97
00:06:35,161 --> 00:06:38,892
They see it as this big fucking commitment,
but that's just bullshit, man.

98
00:06:38,965 --> 00:06:41,957
'Cause commitment, I always say,
is just a word. Okay?

99
00:06:42,034 --> 00:06:45,003
Commitment is just a word.
By the time you're ready to get married...

100
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:48,336
you've already been
in a committed relationship for a while, right?

101
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:52,777
So at that point, marriage is just
a ceremony and a killer fucking party...

102
00:06:52,845 --> 00:06:55,439
and a change in your tax status,
that's right.

103
00:06:55,515 --> 00:06:57,881
- Well, I guess you're right.
- Of course I'm fucking right!

104
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:02,512
That's why I'm sharing this with you
'cause I know it's tough to find a commiserator
amongst all these knuckleheads.

105
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:04,852
No, I appreciate it.
I appreciate that. Thank you.

106
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:09,418
And let me tell you about one more thing
to ease your conscience... the bachelor party.

107
00:07:09,495 --> 00:07:13,226
- Please.
- The bachelor party is kind of like
declaring martial law...

108
00:07:13,299 --> 00:07:15,961
for married guys,
or about-to-be married guys.

109
00:07:16,035 --> 00:07:17,969
So, what I'm saying,
is at that point...

110
00:07:18,037 --> 00:07:21,905
all the rules and all the structures
get kicked to the fucking curb, right?

111
00:07:21,974 --> 00:07:25,273
So that means you relax,
you have a good time... a very good time.

112
00:07:25,344 --> 00:07:27,505
- No worries, man. No worries.
- Yeah. All right.

113
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:29,912
- I love you. I love you to death.
- Thanks for coming.

114
00:07:29,982 --> 00:07:31,574
- Okay.
- Who's next?

115
00:07:31,651 --> 00:07:35,018
Uh, that'd be me.
Excuse me, gentlemen.

- Hi.

Mmm!

118
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:44,457
Jeremy, I'm gonna get out of this
exactly what I put into it.

we are under martial law.

- Time for my announcement.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, hey, hey.

Why you so hell-bent on doing this?

126
00:08:09,922 --> 00:08:12,914
Because... this is my bachelor party...

127
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:16,052
and my wedding has been canceled.

128
00:08:16,128 --> 00:08:21,191
See what I'm getting at? Secondly, I don't
wanna hear any more stupid theories
on marriage from these clowns.

129
00:08:21,267 --> 00:08:24,498
And lastly, to get this goddamn
bowling ball off my leg.

as the bowling ball goes, it stays.

00:08:35,448 --> 00:08:38,246
well, at least...

134
00:08:40,319 --> 00:08:42,549
you can ignore them,
you can blow 'em off.

135
00:08:42,622 --> 00:08:44,590
They don't mean anything to you.

136
00:08:44,657 --> 00:08:46,818
If you go around telling everybody here...

137
00:08:46,893 --> 00:08:51,159
that you got dumped, you're gonna have
to start hearing their theories on that.

138
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:53,596

I didn't get dumped.

139
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:57,261

don't get upset, all right?

140

has a reason to get upset, it should be me.

141
00:09:02,074 --> 00:09:04,065
- Why should you be upset?
- Because...

142
00:09:04,143 --> 00:09:07,340
you guys call off the wedding and I'm stuck
with airplane tickets to New Jersey.

143
00:09:07,413 --> 00:09:11,247
I get one... one vacation a year, Jer...

144
00:09:11,317 --> 00:09:14,878
and I gotta spend it in the land
of chicks with big hair?

145
00:09:14,954 --> 00:09:19,015
And the Boss? I mean,
what kind of vacation is that?

146
00:09:21,127 --> 00:09:23,891
Jer, listen.

147
00:09:23,963 --> 00:09:28,024
This is a situation
that most guys would kill for...

148
00:09:31,003 --> 00:09:34,996
a totally guilt-free bachelor party.

149
00:09:36,509 --> 00:09:39,103
- How cool is that?
- Hey.

150
00:09:39,178 --> 00:09:41,669
Time for the time-honored tradition...

151
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:43,977

00:10:40,906 --> 00:10:42,840
screwin' around
with little boys and shit.

167
00:10:42,908 --> 00:10:45,741
- You know what I'm saying.
- Yeah, nothing wrong with Prince.

Little dude with a pompadour running around
in fuck-me boots singing like a chick.

Yeah, he's weird, like...
I mean...

170
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:55,180
Okay, I wouldn't hang out with him
or anything...

171
00:10:55,254 --> 00:10:59,088
but at least he's married to a hot chick
and he ain't screwing around with little boys.

172
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:02,559
The only reason he's not screwing around
with little boys is he can't hold 'em down.

173

[Laughing] Michael Jackson ain't exactly
Stone Cold Steve Austin, ya know.

175
00:11:09,468 --> 00:11:12,960
No, but he'd kick Prince's
little bitch-ass.

176
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:15,030
What?

177
00:11:16,942 --> 00:11:21,345
You ever see those kicks
Prince throws out on stage?

178
00:11:21,414 --> 00:11:25,214
He'd take Michael Jackson out
with one of those roundhouses into his shit.

179
00:11:25,284 --> 00:11:28,913
The Rockettes kick when they sing.
It doesn't make 'em black belts.

180
00:11:28,988 --> 00:11:32,583
I never said he was a black belt. I just said
he'd kick Michael Jacksons ass any day.

181
00:11:32,658 --> 00:11:35,889
- I'd put money on it.
- Please, Biscuit, you're giving me
a headache with that.

182
00:11:35,961 --> 00:11:38,429
Call Don King and set it up.
But until then...

183
00:11:38,497 --> 00:11:41,057
finish that up and let's do this.

What was it?

188
00:12:21,107 --> 00:12:23,098
It sounded...

189
00:12:25,044 --> 00:12:28,912
It sounded like "When Doves Cry."
[Laughing]

190
00:12:28,981 --> 00:12:32,348

Now that, my friend,
is what it's all about.

I don't think he'll have time to go
breaking into people's houses with us.

210

through the metal detector with this thing on?
- [Shane] What, are you kidding me?

215
00:16:39,131 --> 00:16:43,295
You ever see the people who watch these things,
man? They probably won't even notice.

216
00:16:43,369 --> 00:16:46,361
It's scary to think they're

217
00:16:46,438 --> 00:16:49,066
Well, sad as they are,
I think they'll notice this.

- And what's Kerri gonna think?
- Hey. Hey, who cares what she thinks?

219
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:56,645
Just tell her it's a little reminder
of the kick-ass bachelor party you had.

220
00:16:56,715 --> 00:16:59,149
It'll probably burn her up
that you still went through with it.

221
00:16:59,218 --> 00:17:02,585
- I'm not trying to burn her up, Shane.
- Why not?

222
00:17:02,654 --> 00:17:05,885
Because if I piss her off, I'll never find out
why she called off the wedding.

223
00:17:08,127 --> 00:17:10,254
I can't believe you don't know.

224
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:12,661

to really talk to her yet.

you're gonna have to run away?

Well, in that case...

- [Jeremy] You've had the key this whole time?
- What?

Okay, here we go.

"Glad to see you're having fun"?

Come on, Jeremy. You don't think
I got the message out there?

241
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:26,894
- What message? What are you talking about?
- We're flying home for what
would be our wedding, but it's not...

242
00:18:26,972 --> 00:18:30,806
and your friend is removing a ball and chain
from your ankle for me to see?

243
00:18:30,876 --> 00:18:33,344
I got the message.
It was very cute.

244
00:18:33,412 --> 00:18:37,075
Jesus, Kerri, that's not what that was.
That was for my bachelor party last night.

245
00:18:37,149 --> 00:18:40,846
Your bachelor party?
Jeremy, we're not getting married.

246

Yeah, I've heard.

247
00:18:47,926 --> 00:18:50,986
Let me ask you
a real stupid question.

248
00:18:51,063 --> 00:18:55,022
Have you told everybody
that the wedding's off yet?

00:19:01,273 --> 00:19:04,242
Look, Kerri, l-I have told
a few people...

252
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:07,005
but every time I tell someone,
they say, "What happened?"

253
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:09,013
I don't know what happened.

254
00:19:09,081 --> 00:19:12,710
So the next time somebody asks you
what happened, tell them you don't know.

255
00:19:12,784 --> 00:19:15,446
They'll understand.

256
00:19:17,356 --> 00:19:20,382
Don't worry, Jeremy.
I'm not gonna bother you the whole flight.

257
00:19:20,459 --> 00:19:23,553
As soon as everyone gets on,
I'm gonna find an empty seat and move.

258
00:19:23,629 --> 00:19:27,622
No. Kerri, I don't want you to move.
I wanna talk to you.

259
00:19:27,699 --> 00:19:30,190
- Oh, you wanna talk now, huh?
- Yes.

260
00:19:30,269 --> 00:19:32,567
You didn't wanna talk
the night we called the wedding off.

261
00:19:32,638 --> 00:19:35,129
You didn't wanna talk
when you moved out.

262
00:19:35,207 --> 00:19:38,870
Here. There's a magazine...

263
00:19:38,944 --> 00:19:41,071
'cause it's too late for talking.

264
00:19:42,314 --> 00:19:46,080
Hey, slick, why don't you
move on over?

265
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:50,344
Come on.

266
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:57,556

Thank you for choosing West-To-East Airlines...

267
00:19:57,629 --> 00:20:01,565
for today's nonstop flight
from Las Vegas to Newark, New Jersey.

268
00:20:01,633 --> 00:20:04,124
Due to a cancellation
of last night's red-eye flight...

269
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:06,171
we're expecting a full flight
this morning.

270
00:20:06,238 --> 00:20:09,366
So we're gonna ask that you move
to your seats and keep the aisles clear...

271
00:20:09,441 --> 00:20:13,969
so we can finish the boarding process
and begin final preparations before takeoff.

00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:39,799
- [Boy #2] Hell yeah.
- That doesn't seem like work to me.

279
00:20:39,871 --> 00:20:44,035
I'm thinking about asking them
for a summer job. How cool would that be?

280
00:20:44,109 --> 00:20:46,737
Are you kidding? Justin Calderone
worked for 'em last summer.

281
00:20:46,812 --> 00:20:49,645
He was in a 12-step program by August.
Look at 'em.

282
00:20:49,715 --> 00:20:52,707
It's 7:30 in the morning
and they're drinking already.

283
00:20:52,784 --> 00:20:57,153
I heard by noon he had to drive the truck.
And Justin didn't even have a license.

284
00:20:57,222 --> 00:20:59,588
I'm surprised they still
have all their limbs.

285
00:20:59,658 --> 00:21:02,126
I mean, look at all those mowers
and Weedwhackers.

286
00:21:02,194 --> 00:21:04,162
That's pretty dangerous.

287
00:21:04,229 --> 00:21:06,493
It's just a matter of time.

288
00:21:06,565 --> 00:21:08,556
S'up?

289
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:25,106
Sir, I'm sorry. She's gonna have
to return her seat to the upright position.

290
00:21:25,183 --> 00:21:27,845
- We're about to land.
- Yeah, okay.

291
00:21:29,087 --> 00:21:31,521
Sorry about the drool.

292
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:35,026

Marty's coming to get me.

298
00:21:54,546 --> 00:21:58,778
Besides, I don't know if it's a good idea
for you to be around my dad right now.

299
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:02,581
What do you mean? Kerri, you're the one
that called off the wedding, not me.

300
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:07,091
I know, but I'm sure he thinks
it's because of something you did.

301
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:09,957
I didn't do anything. I even offered
to pay back half the money.

302
00:22:10,028 --> 00:22:11,962
It's not about the money, Jeremy.

303
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:14,624
I got the deposit back
from the reception hall.

304
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:18,966
- I thought it was nonrefundable.
- It was...

305
00:22:19,037 --> 00:22:21,972
but, um... but my mom said you died.

306
00:22:24,042 --> 00:22:27,773
They sent us an arrangement
of flowers and a nice card.

307
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:31,873
Well, that was sure supporting of them.
Did your mother put them on my grave?

308
00:23:05,283 --> 00:23:07,274
What the hell...

309
00:23:09,921 --> 00:23:13,880
Kerri, this is stupid. Let me drive you home.
It's not like I have to come into your house.

310
00:23:13,959 --> 00:23:18,020
You don't have to stay, Jer.
She'll be here.

311
00:23:18,096 --> 00:23:21,293
Is Jersey that depressing
you had to go straight to the bar?

312
00:23:21,366 --> 00:23:25,598

- I gave into society and joined some bullshit gym.

313

- Marty, you said you wouldn't do that!

[Marty]
I'm sorry. It was a freak thing.

319
00:23:43,355 --> 00:23:45,550
- It was like a spasm.
- Are you okay?

320
00:23:45,624 --> 00:23:49,924
Yeah, I'm fine. I just like to
stretch out after long plane rides.

321
00:23:49,995 --> 00:23:52,623
What better place than right here
on the floor?

322
00:23:52,697 --> 00:23:55,666
I'm sorry. I didn't know
she was gonna do that.

323
00:23:55,734 --> 00:23:58,362
She's just disappointed she's not gonna
be maid of honor this weekend.

324
00:23:58,437 --> 00:24:00,667
You called off the wedding, not me.

325
00:24:00,739 --> 00:24:02,798
Because of something you did,
I'm sure.

326
00:24:02,874 --> 00:24:05,468
I'm gonna have to explain this
a million times this week.

327
00:24:05,544 --> 00:24:07,705
Maybe then people will understand.

328
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:11,408
Until then, you should
probably get a cup.

329
00:24:13,585 --> 00:24:15,746
Good-bye, Jeremy.

330
00:24:18,089 --> 00:24:21,388
I don't know what you did,
but you're killing her.

331
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:24,361

Hey, Dad.

Dad?

Dad?

- Hey, Mom.
- Hey, handsome.

345
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:34,910
- How was your flight?
- Oh, you know, it was long.

346
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:38,581
- Yeah.
- So, is Dad losing his hearing?

- You guys are ready for a home. I knew it.

You okay, Jeremy?

349
00:27:46,798 --> 00:27:48,766
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

350
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:51,199
Things are just a little weird
right now.

351
00:27:51,269 --> 00:27:55,933
Yeah. Everybody's asking me what happened,
and I don't know what to tell 'em.

352
00:27:56,007 --> 00:28:00,603
I'm sorry. I should have called 'em.
I don't know what to tell 'em either though.

353
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:04,979
Well, I'll keep holding 'em off,
and when you're ready to talk to 'em, you can.

354
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:08,781
In the meantime, you must be starving.
You want something to eat?

355
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:10,878
Yeah, I could eat.

356
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:14,219
Biscuit, I'm not trying to be
the boss or nothing here...

357
00:28:14,292 --> 00:28:16,692
but you gotta stop doing that.

358
00:28:16,761 --> 00:28:19,594
We work in a dangerous environment
where accidents are bound to happen.

359
00:28:19,664 --> 00:28:22,224
But we can't afford to lose
any more customers...

360
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:25,326
not to mention what
that does to the blades.

361
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:28,529
You know...

362
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:32,476
she didn't call the police
until you got there, Gil.

363
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:35,035
Hey, I was just doing
some damage control.

364
00:28:35,113 --> 00:28:39,174
I was looking for a bright side. Just because she
wasn't quite ready for that, don't blame me!

365
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:42,947
You don't have to yell.
I agreed with you, Gil.

366
00:28:43,021 --> 00:28:45,512
Her lawn will grow back
healthier and thicker.

367
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:50,687
I just think she needed a little bit more time
before you started showing her the benefits.
That's all.

- [Scoffs]
- Maybe if we just pretended nothing happened...

369
00:28:53,364 --> 00:28:56,197
we could have come back next week
and she would have forgotten about it.

370
00:28:56,267 --> 00:29:00,363
"Pretended nothing happened"? Her backyard
was so red, it looked like fucking Mars.

371
00:29:00,438 --> 00:29:04,499
I don't mean pretend it didn't happen.
I mean, obviously it did.

372
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:08,569
I just think we should have acted
like it was no big deal.

373
00:29:08,646 --> 00:29:12,013
The dog's tongue actually hit her.

374
00:29:15,787 --> 00:29:17,721
Can we just drop it, please?

375
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:23,183
Frankly, the whole thing
is just a buzz kill, man.

376
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:25,786
You think Jeremys home yet?

377
00:29:25,864 --> 00:29:28,458

Our blushing groom? Probably.

378
00:29:28,533 --> 00:29:30,524
[Chuckles]
Shit, man.

379
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:34,561
Jeremy's getting married.

380
00:29:35,573 --> 00:29:38,167
That's weird.

381
00:29:38,243 --> 00:29:40,336
We're gonna have to
bring, like, flowers...

382
00:29:40,411 --> 00:29:43,938
or, like, a bottle of wine
when we go over to his house now.

383
00:29:44,015 --> 00:29:48,475
Biscuit, when did you become Joe Rockefeller,
lavishing gifts on women?

384
00:29:48,553 --> 00:29:52,045
For your information,
I happen to have quite a reputation...

385
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:55,024
for being very generous
when it comes to the ladies.

386
00:29:55,093 --> 00:29:59,393
[Scoffs] What? The last date you had
was in sixth grade with Sarah Fargis.

387
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:02,160
And the only thing I'm aware
of you giving her was scabies.

388
00:30:02,233 --> 00:30:04,963
Is that your idea
of a generous gift... a parasite?

389
00:30:05,036 --> 00:30:08,597
Sarah Fargis gave me scabies.

390
00:30:08,673 --> 00:30:11,335
That's why I broke up with her.

391
00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:16,747
And I have had many dates
since Miss Fargis, thank you.

392
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:19,340
Oh, you broke up with her, huh?

393
00:30:19,417 --> 00:30:23,285
Biscuit, need I remind you that you were the only
kid in elementary school with a restraining order?

394
00:30:23,354 --> 00:30:26,517
You weren't allowed on the playground
for recess, for Christ sakes.

395
00:30:26,591 --> 00:30:30,721
All right, all right! Man!

396
00:30:30,795 --> 00:30:33,059
Fuck that Fargis bitch!

397
00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:37,893
- Can we please just go call Jeremy?
- Sure.

414

Vegas is hot. It was 100 degrees when I left.
That was 8:30 this morning.

- Good God. Is the broad with you?
- No, she's at her parent's house.

- No. Why should I be nervous?

- Cool.

00:32:11,562 --> 00:32:15,089
- Do you need a lift?
- No, it's okay. I got a rental car.

420
00:32:15,166 --> 00:32:18,897
- It's kind of cool
seeing everything again, you know?
- As if anything's changed.

421
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:22,701
We're, like, stuck in a time capsule here.
It's very sad. I'll see you there.

422
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:24,935
All right. I'll see you there.

423
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:31,071
I need you.

424
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:38,111
- That's 20 bucks, asshole.
- Fuck.

425
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:43,389
What's 20 bucks?

426
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:50,791
I bet Gil here 20 bucks that you'd come out
of the closet before the end of the year.

427
00:32:50,868 --> 00:32:53,200
Out of the closet?
I am not gay.

428
00:32:53,271 --> 00:32:56,763
- Yeah.
- I'm just saying that the homosexual lifestyle...

429
00:32:56,841 --> 00:32:59,366
in theory, is ideal.

430
00:32:59,444 --> 00:33:03,073
Uh-huh. You're gay.

431
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:05,877
- [Scoffs] You know what I'm saying.
- No, I don't.

432
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:09,283
I'm just saying guys and girls
are just two different animals.

433
00:33:09,354 --> 00:33:12,812
Cats and dogs if you will.
Guys are like the dogs...

434
00:33:12,890 --> 00:33:17,088
not too bright, they like to take rides in cars
and they hump anyone's leg two seconds
after they meet them.

435
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:20,028
- Accurate?
- For argument's sake, okay.

436
00:33:20,098 --> 00:33:22,726
All right. Now, girls
are like the cats...

437
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,927
a little mysterious,
kind of standoffish.

438
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:28,404
It takes a long time to win 'em over, right?
But once you do win 'em over...

439
00:33:28,473 --> 00:33:31,670
they're all rubbing on your leg
and purring they love you and shit.

440
00:33:31,743 --> 00:33:34,337
Now, do cats love dogs?

441
00:33:34,412 --> 00:33:38,109
For the most part, no. Why? Because
they're two different animals. It's unnatural.

442
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:40,980
That's not to say there aren't
cats and dogs that do get along.

443
00:33:41,052 --> 00:33:44,317
But that takes special circumstances.
They need to be raised together.

444
00:33:44,389 --> 00:33:46,755
One of them needs to be blind
or something fucked up.

445
00:33:46,824 --> 00:33:50,590
Now, do dogs like dogs?

446
00:33:50,661 --> 00:33:54,324
They sure do. Two dogs meet, two minutes later,
they're going at it wherever they are.

447
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:57,835
Why? Because they're the same animal!
They already know what each other wants.

448
00:33:57,902 --> 00:34:01,167
There's no games.
Guys all know what other guys want... sex.

449
00:34:01,239 --> 00:34:04,174
That's it. No romance,
no long strolls on the beach.

450
00:34:04,242 --> 00:34:07,143
Just straight-up nasty sex.
You guys follow this?

451
00:34:07,211 --> 00:34:10,237
Allow me...

452
00:34:10,314 --> 00:34:12,908
macho man.

453
00:34:12,984 --> 00:34:16,283
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

454
00:34:16,354 --> 00:34:18,288
Fruitcake.

455
00:34:18,356 --> 00:34:22,224
I can't believe I left a gay guy
in charge of the bachelor party.

456
00:34:22,293 --> 00:34:26,252
I am not gay!
I just know what works and what doesn't.

457
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:28,992
And men dating men works.

458
00:34:30,001 --> 00:34:33,937
- That was nice.
- You know...

459
00:34:34,005 --> 00:34:37,441
You know, I can't believe this doesn't
make sense to you guys. Think about it.

460
00:34:37,508 --> 00:34:40,033
There'd be no more arguing
about what to watch on TV.

461
00:34:40,111 --> 00:34:42,773
You could wear each other's clothes.

462
00:34:42,847 --> 00:34:46,078
You wouldn't have to buy that fat-free shit
at the supermarket. It just works, man.

463
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:50,018
- Are you done?
- There'd be no more laboring
over fancy pick-up lines.

464
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:52,852
It's just, "Hi. I'm Biscuit.
Wanna fuck?"

465
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:55,984
Will you... For Christ sakes, man!

466
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:59,120
Once you guys come out of the closet,
it's gay this and gay that.

467
00:34:59,197 --> 00:35:01,529
Where the hell is Jeremy?
At least he's getting married.

468
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:04,067
- I don't have to worry about him
turning gay on me.
- Aha!

469
00:35:04,135 --> 00:35:07,195
- I'm glad you brought up getting married.
- Oh.

470
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:11,970
I believe weddings are the only reason
girls and guys are together.

471
00:35:12,043 --> 00:35:16,980
Wedding's a strictly female thing. Guys could give
a shit about a wedding or if they ever get married.

472
00:35:17,048 --> 00:35:20,176
That's why girls marry guys...
so they can be the center of attention.

473
00:35:20,251 --> 00:35:24,415
If girls were to marry girls, they'd have to share
the spotlight. And they're not about to do that.

474
00:35:24,489 --> 00:35:30,052
So, they marry guys. Do you think Jeremy
knows anything about his wedding?
No. He could care less, I'll bet.

475
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:32,255
- Can I buy you two drunks a beer?
- [Gil] Hey.!

476
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:36,460
- [Biscuit] Hey, man.
- You guys haven't left these stools
since I left you last, huh?

477
00:35:36,534 --> 00:35:38,968
- Yeah, we like it here.
- What's going on?

478
00:35:39,036 --> 00:35:41,470
You just missed it.
Biscuit just came out of the closet.

479
00:35:41,539 --> 00:35:44,235
- Really? Did you pay Al?
- I had to.

480
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:47,038
I am not gay!

481
00:35:47,111 --> 00:35:50,171
- Jeremy, what color are
the bridesmaid dresses?
- I don't know.

482
00:35:50,248 --> 00:35:52,273
- See, he could give a shit.
- Uh-huh.

483
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:54,716
Jeremy, how you doin'?
You're gettin' ready for the big day?

484
00:35:54,785 --> 00:35:58,846
- How are you? You look good.
- How 'bout I buy you a drink on the house?

485
00:35:58,923 --> 00:36:01,050
- It's on me.
- I'll take a beer.

486
00:36:01,125 --> 00:36:02,854
You got it.

487
00:36:02,927 --> 00:36:05,259
And how 'bout for the lady?

488
00:36:06,464 --> 00:36:09,558
A spritzer? Glass of wine?

489
00:36:09,634 --> 00:36:11,625
Don't rush me.

490
00:36:14,672 --> 00:36:18,130
- You done with work today?
- [Gil] Uh, yeah. I think we'll call it a day.

491
00:36:18,209 --> 00:36:21,940
- [Al] Here you go.
- Don't stop on my account.
We have plenty of time for a bachelor party.

492
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:25,107
No, we're not stopping on your account.
We're stopping on his.

493
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:27,117
He ran over a dog this morning.

494
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:30,120
Again?

495
00:36:31,389 --> 00:36:33,323
- This time it was an accident.
- [Scoffs]

496
00:36:33,391 --> 00:36:35,450
Uh-huh.

497
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:38,586
So, what's this wedding
gonna be like?

498
00:36:38,663 --> 00:36:41,598
What do you mean?
What do you think it's gonna be like, jackass?

499
00:36:41,666 --> 00:36:43,793
I don't know.
I've never been to a wedding before.

500
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:47,463
- You've never been to a wedding?
- Hasn't your sister married?

501
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:51,065
- Yeah, but I only saw pictures.
- You didn't go to your own sister's wedding?

502
00:36:51,142 --> 00:36:53,133
No. My folks said I wouldn't like it.

503
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:57,910
They said there'd be, like, a lot of, um, like,
dancing and, like, singing in Italian.

504
00:36:57,982 --> 00:37:00,610
That's not a wedding.
That's an opera.

505
00:37:00,685 --> 00:37:02,778
You're not even Italian anyway.

506
00:37:02,853 --> 00:37:04,787
I thought it sounded kind of strange too.

507
00:37:04,855 --> 00:37:06,982
Anyway, I think we should
talk about the wedding.

508
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:10,619
I know you guys tried to tell me
it was a mistake.

509
00:37:10,695 --> 00:37:13,528
[Gil] Oh. I knew this was gonna
come up sooner or later.

510
00:37:13,598 --> 00:37:16,499
Jer, Biscuit and I
were just being selfish.

511
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:19,502
You know, we wanted you
to stay one of the guys.

512
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:22,130
Since you and Kerri went away
to school together...

513
00:37:22,206 --> 00:37:24,504
and stuck it out
and made a life for yourselves...

514
00:37:24,575 --> 00:37:26,634
I mean, we couldn't be happier for you.

515
00:37:26,711 --> 00:37:29,179
Kerri is a beautiful, gorgeous girl...

516
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:31,977
and quite frankly,
I'm a little jealous.

517
00:37:32,049 --> 00:37:33,983
Me too!

518
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:37,187
Et tu, Biscuit?

519
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:39,951
I mean, Kerri's a great catch.

520
00:37:40,024 --> 00:37:43,892
She's smart, she's funny...

521
00:37:43,961 --> 00:37:45,792
she's beautiful.

522
00:37:45,863 --> 00:37:48,354
What more could a man ask for?

523
00:37:48,432 --> 00:37:50,423
[Sighs]

524
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:55,766
I know we should have said this
to you sooner, but you guys live in Vegas.

525
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:59,606
- It's not like we see you a lot.
- I can't believe you guys want me to get married.

526
00:37:59,677 --> 00:38:01,872
Yeah, of course we do, man.

527
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:04,278
Kerri and I broke up.

528
00:38:05,349 --> 00:38:07,340
The wedding's off.

529
00:38:08,753 --> 00:38:10,983
Really?

530
00:38:11,055 --> 00:38:13,956
Yeah, really.
We're not getting married.

531
00:38:16,827 --> 00:38:20,285
- That's fuckin' great!
- No man should ever get married!

532
00:38:20,364 --> 00:38:22,355
- Really? This... It's off?
- Yeah, it's off.

533
00:38:22,433 --> 00:38:27,393
- Ladies and gentlemen,
we have a stay of execution.
- Thank you, Governor. Close call.

534
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:31,430
- You guys are happy about this?
- Of course we're happy.

535
00:38:31,509 --> 00:38:33,773
I wouldn't wish marriage
on my worst enemy.

536
00:38:33,844 --> 00:38:37,211
What about all that "you're lucky" stuff
and "I'm jealous" shit?

537
00:38:37,281 --> 00:38:39,875
Dude, it almost killed me
to say that shit to you.

538
00:38:39,950 --> 00:38:42,919
But we thought this is what you wanted,
so we should encourage you.

539
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:46,787
- Biscuit and I practiced all day yesterday.
- We were pretty good, huh?

540
00:38:46,857 --> 00:38:49,417
Yeah.

541
00:38:49,493 --> 00:38:53,259
- So why'd you dump her?
- Because she was smothering the shit out of him.

542
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:56,858
[Biscuit] Either that, or you hooked up
with one of them Vegas showgirls, right?

543
00:38:56,934 --> 00:38:59,459
- Ooh, I forgot about the showgirls.
- [Chuckles]

544
00:38:59,537 --> 00:39:02,097
Actually, she sort of
called off the wedding.

545
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:05,540
- She called it off? Why?
- Because she found someone new, asshole.

546
00:39:05,609 --> 00:39:08,043
- Who's better than Jeremy? Come on.
- I don't know.

547
00:39:08,112 --> 00:39:11,309
Somebody with a better future,
more money, better looks.

548
00:39:11,382 --> 00:39:13,316
- Bigger dick.
- Ooh.

549
00:39:13,384 --> 00:39:15,909
Hey, come on!

550
00:39:15,986 --> 00:39:18,580
I got a big dick.

551
00:39:18,656 --> 00:39:21,124
- Uh-huh.
- So why'd she do it then?

552
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:24,923
I don't know.
She said she just wasn't happy.

553
00:39:24,995 --> 00:39:26,963
[Together]
Small dick.

554
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:29,966
Hey, will you guys shut up, please?
Can we drop it?

555
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:34,130
All right, look. We're sorry. Who cares why
she did it? Let's just be happy she did.

556
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:37,299
- Yeah.
- You, uh, need another beer, little man?

557
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:39,309
[Chuckles]

558
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:44,514
Are you sure?

559
00:39:44,582 --> 00:39:46,948
Marty, please, of course I'm sure.

560
00:39:47,017 --> 00:39:49,815
Who have I been spilling my guts to
all week long anyway?

561
00:39:49,887 --> 00:39:55,416
Me, but I was sure that when I got you home, you'd
tell me all about your new man with the big prick.

562
00:39:55,493 --> 00:39:59,429
Sorry to disappoint you, but this certainly
isn't about anybody with a big prick.

563
00:39:59,497 --> 00:40:04,025
That tells us a little bit about Jeremy, and that
alone is grounds for calling off the wedding.

564
00:40:04,101 --> 00:40:06,365
Oh, God, I wish it was that easy.

565
00:40:06,437 --> 00:40:08,371
Then at least people would understand.

566
00:40:08,439 --> 00:40:11,169
Kerri, people do understand.
They're just in shock.

567
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:13,938
Even I was a little surprised
when you called off the wedding.

568
00:40:14,011 --> 00:40:17,538
When you first told me about it,
I just thought you had cold feet.

569
00:40:17,615 --> 00:40:20,140
Yeah, I thought so too.

570
00:40:20,217 --> 00:40:23,015
That's why it went on for so long.

571
00:40:23,087 --> 00:40:25,351
[Knocking]

572
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:28,187
Come in.

573
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:30,193
[Boy]
Hey, Marty.

574
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:33,025
Mom wants to know if you can eat over.

575
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:36,828
Oh, thanks, stud, but I don't think so.
I haven't been feeling so good lately.

576
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:42,129
Shut up. Tell Mom she will.

577
00:40:42,206 --> 00:40:43,867
Cliff.

578
00:40:43,941 --> 00:40:47,206
Make sure I'm sitting next to you.

579
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:49,371
Absolutely.

580
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:51,176
[Door Closes]

581
00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:56,984
What do you think would happen if I just
grabbed his little pecker underneath the table?

582
00:40:57,054 --> 00:40:59,147
He would probably combust.

583
00:40:59,223 --> 00:41:01,521
Yeah.

584
00:41:01,592 --> 00:41:04,561
So, anyway, I just...

585
00:41:04,628 --> 00:41:07,222
don't see anything wrong
with not wanting to marry a guy...

586
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:09,892
who's not in love with me anymore.

587
00:41:11,335 --> 00:41:16,068
I want somebody who after 50 years
still looks at me like he's lucky to have me.

588
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:24,205
God, Marty, I thought you out of all people
in the world would understand that.

589
00:41:24,281 --> 00:41:26,909
But it sounds like you think
I made a mistake too.

590
00:41:26,984 --> 00:41:29,748
I don't think you made a mistake.
I'm just saying that sometimes...

591
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:32,118
it might be nice
to have someone who...

592
00:41:32,189 --> 00:41:34,350
Marty, you don't even understand.

593
00:41:34,425 --> 00:41:37,292
You've never been in a relationship
for more than a month.

594
00:41:37,361 --> 00:41:39,420
You don't know what it's like...

595
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:43,058
to date a guy who treats you
more like a sister than a lover.

596
00:41:43,133 --> 00:41:47,695
You break off every relationship
before it even gets to that.

597
00:41:47,771 --> 00:41:50,103
Marty, no.

598
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:56,606
L-I really... I don't think
anything's wrong with that.

599
00:41:56,680 --> 00:42:00,116
I actually think all women should
break up with guys after two months...

600
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:04,416
to avoid having to feel
the way I did with Jeremy.

601
00:42:04,488 --> 00:42:07,082
When things started cooling down,
I felt like it was my fault...

602
00:42:07,157 --> 00:42:10,354
like I wasn't attractive enough,
like I wasn't good enough.

603
00:42:10,427 --> 00:42:14,386
I know I'm not, but anyway,
I really... I didn't mean it as a put-down.

604
00:42:14,465 --> 00:42:19,596
No, I know you didn't. Listen, if I thought
you were putting me down, I'd kick your ass.

605
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:21,661
So what's wrong?

606
00:42:23,574 --> 00:42:26,008
I'm pregnant.

607
00:42:26,076 --> 00:42:28,067
Are you sure?

608
00:42:29,413 --> 00:42:32,439
- Do you know whose it is?
- Of course I know whose it is.

609
00:42:32,516 --> 00:42:37,078
Just because I've been out with a lot of guys
doesn't mean I've slept with them all.

610
00:42:37,154 --> 00:42:39,622
Can I ask?

611
00:42:39,690 --> 00:42:42,181
You don't know him.
He's just some guy.

612
00:42:43,427 --> 00:42:47,488
- Did you tell him?
- No. I don't even know what I'm gonna do yet.

613
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:51,331
Oh, God, Marty. I'm so sorry.
Here I am going on and on about myself...

614
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:55,338
No, it's fine, really. I mean,
it helped me get my mind off of it.

615
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:58,000
It actually helped.

616
00:42:58,075 --> 00:43:01,044
Well, I still feel like a jerk.

617
00:43:01,111 --> 00:43:03,045
So what are you gonna do?

618
00:43:03,113 --> 00:43:05,240
What can I do?

619
00:43:05,316 --> 00:43:09,252
Well, I mean, is the guy willing
to help at least financially?

620
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:12,050
Yeah, I guess so.

621
00:43:12,122 --> 00:43:14,317
He owns his own business.

622
00:43:14,391 --> 00:43:18,760
You know what? I can't...
I can't really talk about this right now.

623
00:43:18,829 --> 00:43:22,731
It's just... It was good
to tell someone. Thanks.

624
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:25,428
[Cliff]
Kerri, dinner.!

625
00:43:25,502 --> 00:43:29,529
You know what? You really don't have to
stay for dinner. I completely understand.

626
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:33,703
Any chance your mom's got some
Mountain Dew ice cubes in the freezer?

627
00:43:33,777 --> 00:43:36,940
- I'm cravin' 'em.
- I'll check.

628
00:43:37,014 --> 00:43:40,040
Okay. Oh, hey.

629
00:43:40,117 --> 00:43:43,553
What's the deal with the skivvies
under the mattress?

630
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:48,524
You know when you go camping and you put
your food up in a tree to keep it away
from the bears?

631
00:43:48,592 --> 00:43:51,584
- Mm-hmm.
- Well, when you have a 13-year-old brother...

632
00:43:51,662 --> 00:43:54,256
you take the same precautions
with your underwear.

633
00:43:54,331 --> 00:43:57,664
- Ew, fuck.
- Yeah.

634
00:43:58,302 --> 00:44:02,363
[Biscuit]
All right. What's it gonna be?

635
00:44:02,439 --> 00:44:06,500
- Him or me?
- Jer, look, you gotta do this.

636
00:44:06,577 --> 00:44:09,410
If he goes over there,
we are gonna get kicked out of here.

637
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:12,244
We may even wind up in a fight.
Do you see her friend?

638
00:44:12,316 --> 00:44:16,514
She looks a little scrappy.
I think she can take us.

639
00:44:16,587 --> 00:44:18,680
I don't wanna do this.
I really don't.

640
00:44:18,756 --> 00:44:20,986
I told you, I'm not ready for it.

641
00:44:21,058 --> 00:44:23,322
- Okay, the choice is made.
- No, no, no.

642
00:44:23,394 --> 00:44:25,521
- I'm going in.
- Wait. Jer, come on.

643
00:44:25,596 --> 00:44:28,997
I've seen this a million times.
If he goes, it ain't gonna be pretty.

644
00:44:29,066 --> 00:44:32,194
Look, if you go, it may go fine,
it may go bad.

645
00:44:32,269 --> 00:44:34,294
But at least we'll get to stay here.

646
00:44:34,371 --> 00:44:38,102
If he goes, we're gonna get kicked
out of here. Maybe even 86'd for good.

647
00:44:38,175 --> 00:44:42,669
Is that what you want? Imagine never
stepping foot in the Bootlegger again.

648
00:44:42,746 --> 00:44:45,738
Come on, man.
You gotta do this for all of us.

649
00:44:45,816 --> 00:44:48,114
Look at her, man.
She's cute as hell.

650
00:44:48,185 --> 00:44:50,119
Why don't you go then, Gil?

651
00:44:50,187 --> 00:44:53,486
Because if I go over there,
I'm gonna leave with that broad.

652
00:44:53,557 --> 00:44:56,253
In which case, you'd be stuck
here alone with Biscuit.

653
00:44:57,628 --> 00:45:00,927
Look, look! Her friend is going
to the ladies' room. Now's the time.

654
00:45:00,998 --> 00:45:03,432
- Come on. Do this, will ya?
- Hey. Hey.

655
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:06,196
Put in a good word for me
with her friend.

656
00:45:06,270 --> 00:45:09,603
Biscuit, that chick could eat you.

657
00:45:09,673 --> 00:45:12,335
- If I play my cards right.
- [Chuckles]

658
00:45:20,884 --> 00:45:22,909
Can I buy you a drink?

659
00:45:22,986 --> 00:45:26,012
Uh, I don't think so.

660
00:45:26,090 --> 00:45:29,617
Just thought I'd ask.
That's a... That's a nice tattoo.

661
00:45:29,693 --> 00:45:33,857
I've got one too. I've got a "W" tattooed
on each of my ass cheeks.

662
00:45:33,931 --> 00:45:36,365
When I bend over, it says "Wow."

663
00:45:39,136 --> 00:45:41,331
I'm Jeremy.

664
00:45:41,405 --> 00:45:44,067
- I'm Lea.
- Hi, Lea.

665
00:45:44,141 --> 00:45:47,941
- Can I be honest with you for a second?
- Sure.

666
00:45:48,011 --> 00:45:50,536
- Would you like a drink?
- Oh, l... I really can't.

667
00:45:50,614 --> 00:45:52,548
- I'm sorry. Sorry.
- Thanks.

668
00:45:52,616 --> 00:45:55,380
I really didn't wanna come over here...

669
00:45:55,452 --> 00:45:59,946
but, uh, if I didn't, one of my friends
over there was going to.

670
00:46:00,023 --> 00:46:03,891
- And, well, I can tell by looking at you,
you seem like a nice person.
- [Bottles Clanking]

671
00:46:03,961 --> 00:46:06,657
So, I wanted to save you from them.

672
00:46:06,730 --> 00:46:10,496
Oh. Thanks, I think.

673
00:46:10,567 --> 00:46:13,058
It's not that I'm not attracted to you,
'cause I am.

674
00:46:13,137 --> 00:46:15,162
It's just that I'm engaged.

675
00:46:15,239 --> 00:46:17,639
Oh, you're engaged?

676
00:46:17,708 --> 00:46:23,169
Well, not right now, but, uh, I was.
We broke up.

677
00:46:23,247 --> 00:46:28,116
Uh-huh. So what you're trying to tell me
is you're trying to get over somebody.

678
00:46:28,185 --> 00:46:31,985
Uh, no. L...
My friends...

679
00:46:32,055 --> 00:46:34,956
over there want me
to get over someone.

680
00:46:35,025 --> 00:46:39,223
But I'm not sure I'm ready
to get over her.

681
00:46:39,296 --> 00:46:42,823
- Who broke the engagement?
- Uh, she did.

682
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:44,891
Why?

683
00:46:46,036 --> 00:46:49,699
- I don't know.
- Oh, you don't wanna talk about it.

684
00:46:49,773 --> 00:46:54,972
Uh, no. I mean, I don't know
why she broke off the engagement.

685
00:46:56,346 --> 00:46:58,780
Well, did she just walk out on you?

686
00:46:58,849 --> 00:47:02,512
Uh, well, no.
I actually moved out.

687
00:47:05,856 --> 00:47:09,883
You moved out after
she called off the engagement?

688
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:12,224
But you still don't know
why she called it off?

689
00:47:14,665 --> 00:47:18,066
Did you love this girl?

690
00:47:18,135 --> 00:47:20,103
Uh, yeah. Yeah, I did.
I still do.

691
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:24,368
Then how do you not know what happened?
Aren't you a little curious?

692
00:47:24,441 --> 00:47:28,036
I really didn't wanna get into this with you.
I just wanted to buy you a drink.

693
00:47:28,111 --> 00:47:32,980
How's a man just walk away from the woman
he loves and just shrug it off?

694
00:47:33,050 --> 00:47:36,611
I'm not. There's a lot more to it
that I don't care to get into right now.

695
00:47:36,687 --> 00:47:40,418
I don't understand.
I mean, you say that you love this woman.

696
00:47:40,490 --> 00:47:45,450
And you must because you asked her
to marry you, but then when things
get a little strained, you just walk away?

697
00:47:45,529 --> 00:47:48,293
- What the fuck is that?
- You...

698
00:47:48,365 --> 00:47:53,098
Wait. Maybe I just got cold feet, all right?
Maybe I wasn't sure I was ready to get married yet.

699
00:47:53,170 --> 00:47:58,836
- But apparently she wasn't either because
she was the one that called it off.
- Oh, well, how convenient for you.

700
00:47:58,909 --> 00:48:03,972
She was probably just scared or nervous
and needed a little bit of reassurance from you.

701
00:48:04,047 --> 00:48:07,778
I bet she would have loved to have known you
were having doubts and were nervous too...

702
00:48:07,851 --> 00:48:11,287
so that you guys could overcome
them together, or at least try.

703
00:48:11,355 --> 00:48:14,188
But... You did not love this girl.

704
00:48:14,258 --> 00:48:17,318
Now, wait a minute. L-I did...
Yes, I did love... I still do.

705
00:48:17,394 --> 00:48:21,228
What is with you? I should have sent Biscuit
over here. You're right up his alley.

706
00:48:21,298 --> 00:48:26,235
I just wanted to buy you a drink,
and then tell my friends you were married
so they wouldn't bother you.

707
00:48:26,303 --> 00:48:31,036
I was helping you out, believe it or not.
So, just... You know what? Good night.

708
00:48:31,108 --> 00:48:34,009
Can I still have that drink?

709
00:48:34,077 --> 00:48:36,671
That-That was the original plan, right?

710
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:38,738
Uh...

711
00:48:40,717 --> 00:48:45,177
Yeah, yeah, I guess.
I could use one anyway. Tim.

712
00:48:47,457 --> 00:48:51,518
- What'll it be?
- Alabama slammer and a shot of tequila.

713
00:48:53,697 --> 00:48:55,631
Uh, yeah, two of those.

714
00:48:56,767 --> 00:48:59,895
You are full of surprises. I never would
have guessed that would be your order.

715
00:48:59,970 --> 00:49:02,268
- Oh.
- Anything you wanna talk about?

716
00:49:02,339 --> 00:49:06,036
No, I just... I like to have fun, that's all.
This seems to help.

717
00:49:07,644 --> 00:49:11,136
Well, here is to fun.

718
00:49:12,582 --> 00:49:15,449
[Woman]
No.!

719
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:19,512
- You asshole!
- What the fuck did you do that for?

720
00:49:19,589 --> 00:49:22,558
She's an alcoholic, asshole!
We were only in here testing her will.

721
00:49:22,626 --> 00:49:26,323
- How would I know that?
- Why else would we be in this hellhole?

722
00:49:26,396 --> 00:49:30,423
- Oh, come on, Lea. Let's go.
- No! I wanna stay here and drink with my friends!

723
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:32,661
- Lea, come on!
- No, I wanna stay!

724
00:49:32,736 --> 00:49:34,863
- Come on!
- I wanna stay!

725
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:41,370
Fuck! I guess we're not
gonna hook up tonight, huh?

726
00:49:41,445 --> 00:49:45,745
I hope Kerri's better
at the single life than he is.

727
00:49:47,250 --> 00:49:50,083
I think you chipped a tooth.

728
00:49:50,153 --> 00:49:51,347
% % [Disco]

729
00:49:52,155 --> 00:49:54,146
- Hey.
- How you doing?

730
00:49:54,224 --> 00:49:56,249
Good. How are you?

731
00:49:56,326 --> 00:49:58,385
Marty, please, can we go home?

732
00:49:58,462 --> 00:50:02,125
You said you wanted to get
a couple of drinks. Come on.

733
00:50:02,199 --> 00:50:04,224
Can we just get them somewhere else?

734
00:50:04,301 --> 00:50:07,236
You also said you wanted to go somewhere
where we wouldn't see Jeremy.

735
00:50:07,304 --> 00:50:10,137
And I can guarantee you,
we won't see Jeremy here.

736
00:50:10,207 --> 00:50:12,141
Although knowing his friends,
you never know.

737
00:50:14,845 --> 00:50:17,837
What are you looking at?
She's with me!

738
00:50:19,516 --> 00:50:21,780
- Oh, my God.
- Come on. Relax.

739
00:50:21,852 --> 00:50:25,379
I really think you're gonna like it here.
You can just kick back and be yourself...

740
00:50:25,455 --> 00:50:28,447
and have a couple of drinks
and not feel like a piece of meat.

741
00:50:28,525 --> 00:50:31,255
I mean, for the most part,
people are really respectful...

742
00:50:31,328 --> 00:50:34,491
when they see
that you're with someone!

743
00:50:34,564 --> 00:50:36,498
Do you come here a lot?

744
00:50:36,566 --> 00:50:39,501
Well, not a lot, but I've been here
a couple of times, yeah.

745
00:50:39,569 --> 00:50:42,037
Is this where you met the father?

746
00:50:42,105 --> 00:50:45,006
Who do you think I am, Madonna?
[Chuckles]

747
00:50:45,075 --> 00:50:49,603
No, I don't think any of the men here
would be interested in making babies with me.

748
00:50:49,679 --> 00:50:55,015
I just figured given our two situations,
this would be a pretty cool place to hang out.

749
00:50:55,085 --> 00:50:59,112
Besides, you know what? Being a lesbian
is considered very chic nowadays.

750
00:50:59,189 --> 00:51:02,522
When word gets out you were here,
you're gonna be beating men off with a hammer.

751
00:51:02,592 --> 00:51:05,857
Word gets out?
I don't want anybody to know.

752
00:51:05,929 --> 00:51:10,389
What if Jeremy finds out? He's gonna think
that I left him because I'm a lesbian.

753
00:51:10,467 --> 00:51:12,799
Don't worry.
I mean, no offense, Ker...

754
00:51:12,869 --> 00:51:16,305
but Jeremy doesn't exactly hang out
with people high on the social ladder.

755
00:51:16,373 --> 00:51:20,002
Do you think Muffin knows anything
about girls at all?

756
00:51:20,077 --> 00:51:22,807
I guess you have a point.
I just don't want Jeremy thinking...

757
00:51:22,879 --> 00:51:25,677
he somehow turned me off
to men, you know.

758
00:51:25,749 --> 00:51:29,116
Like, "If she can't have me,
she might as well go lesbian," you know.

759
00:51:29,186 --> 00:51:33,782
Okay, stop.
You are not a lesbian!

760
00:51:33,857 --> 00:51:36,985
We are just out for a couple of drinks
and some pleasant conversation.

761
00:51:37,060 --> 00:51:39,051
That's all, okay?

762
00:51:40,464 --> 00:51:42,398
- Okay.
- Okay.

763
00:51:42,466 --> 00:51:45,663
This kid is doing the jig on my bladder.
I gotta go pee.

764
00:51:45,735 --> 00:51:50,104
Go up to the bar and get us drinks.
I'll have a Shirley Temple with a cherry.

765
00:51:53,543 --> 00:51:56,137
I think I'm gonna come with you
to the ladies room.

766
00:51:56,213 --> 00:51:59,444
Gee, you're really getting
into the swing of this place, aren't you?

767
00:51:59,516 --> 00:52:02,076
Okay, don't touch anything.

768
00:52:06,089 --> 00:52:09,320
So, you think they'll get
back together?

769
00:52:11,228 --> 00:52:13,321
[Sighs]
I don't know, man.

770
00:52:13,396 --> 00:52:18,766
I mean, part of me wants 'em to,
but... part of me doesn't.

771
00:52:18,835 --> 00:52:21,429
What do you mean?

772
00:52:21,505 --> 00:52:23,496
Well...

773
00:52:26,309 --> 00:52:30,245
Listen. I know she's out of my league.
It's just...

774
00:52:31,982 --> 00:52:33,973
she's my dream girl.

775
00:52:36,586 --> 00:52:40,181
I like knowing that she's available.

776
00:52:40,257 --> 00:52:43,522
I don't know.
Maybe someday we'll...

777
00:52:43,593 --> 00:52:46,585
bump into each other
and there'll be a spark...

778
00:52:46,663 --> 00:52:49,928
and I'll get to have her.

779
00:52:52,435 --> 00:52:55,165
On the other hand,
if they did get back together...

780
00:52:55,238 --> 00:52:58,537
they might whip out the old video camera
and start taping some kinky sex.

781
00:52:58,608 --> 00:53:02,669
And then I'd be able to enjoy her
at least through that again.

782
00:53:02,746 --> 00:53:05,237
What are you talkin' about?

783
00:53:07,384 --> 00:53:10,285
Pamela and Tommy Lee.
What are you talkin' about?

784
00:53:10,353 --> 00:53:13,481
Kerri and Jeremy, ass head!

785
00:53:13,557 --> 00:53:16,082
Oh, them.
I don't know. Jesus.

786
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:18,093
He can't even figure out
why they broke up.

787
00:53:18,161 --> 00:53:21,858
[Scoffs]
Well, that's obvious. She cheated on him.

788
00:53:21,932 --> 00:53:24,230
She did?
How do you know that, Gil?

789
00:53:24,301 --> 00:53:27,498
Well, think about it. These two
have been together since high school.

790
00:53:27,571 --> 00:53:30,301
They went away to college together.
They were living together.

791
00:53:30,373 --> 00:53:33,171
They were probably taking shits
with the bathroom door open.

792
00:53:33,243 --> 00:53:35,643
- [Chuckles]
- That's already married in my book.

793
00:53:35,712 --> 00:53:40,547
You expect me to believe she just
flipped out one day and called it quits
without so much as an explanation?

794
00:53:40,617 --> 00:53:44,178
I think not. When you catch somebody
cheating on somebody...

795
00:53:44,254 --> 00:53:47,917
it's the only time an explanation
is just not necessary.

796
00:53:47,991 --> 00:53:51,552
- Jesus, you're right.
- Mm-hmm.

797
00:53:51,628 --> 00:53:54,222
I'll bet it was a magician.

798
00:53:55,432 --> 00:53:58,765
- Why a magician?
- 'Cause that's all they have in Vegas.

799
00:53:58,835 --> 00:54:02,271
Magicians, pit bosses and those guys
that pass out the dirty fliers.

800
00:54:02,339 --> 00:54:07,675
Now, Jeremy's probably better
than the flier guys and...

801
00:54:07,744 --> 00:54:12,306
Nah, I don't see her with a pit boss.
So it had to have been a magician.

802
00:54:12,382 --> 00:54:16,045
Hmm. And that's why he doesn't
wanna talk about it with us...

803
00:54:16,119 --> 00:54:18,246
because he's embarrassed.

804
00:54:18,321 --> 00:54:22,121
Jesus Christ.! No, the reason I don't
wanna talk about it with you guys...

805
00:54:22,192 --> 00:54:25,457
is because I don't wanna hear
any of your screwy theories.

806
00:54:25,528 --> 00:54:31,125
- What screwy theories?
- How about the one where
Kerri's screwing Siegfried and Roy?

807
00:54:31,201 --> 00:54:33,897
No, man, I don't think it was them.
They might be gay.

808
00:54:33,970 --> 00:54:37,497
- [Chuckles]
- I love the way you guys talk
about me like I'm not even here.

809
00:54:37,574 --> 00:54:42,068
- Feel free to take part in the conversation.
- I don't wanna take part in it.

810
00:54:42,145 --> 00:54:45,546
- Then what are you complaining about?
- I just wanna have a good time.

811
00:54:45,615 --> 00:54:48,550
Is this your idea of fun? Sitting around
theorizing about Kerri and I?

812
00:54:48,618 --> 00:54:52,987
[Chuckles]
No, man. He's right. Let's do it, dude.

813
00:54:54,424 --> 00:54:56,892
Okay. I suppose it's late enough.

814
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:59,087
- Did you bring your hat and gloves?
- Yes.

815
00:54:59,162 --> 00:55:02,359
- Well, put 'em on.
- Right.

816
00:55:10,674 --> 00:55:13,165
What the fuck is that?

817
00:55:13,243 --> 00:55:16,838
- What?
- Mittens? What, you think
we're gonna make a snowman?

818
00:55:16,913 --> 00:55:19,814
I have no idea.
You told me to get gloves and a hat.

819
00:55:19,883 --> 00:55:23,751
I didn't know you wanted an O.J. Disguise.
What, are we gonna whack somebody?

820
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:27,051
No, we're just gonna do
a little B & E, that's all.

821
00:55:27,123 --> 00:55:29,887
What? What are you guys
robbing people's houses for?

822
00:55:29,959 --> 00:55:31,859
A little extra "K."

823
00:55:31,928 --> 00:55:36,661
We're not robbing people's houses. We're just
gonna go in and rearrange things a little.

824
00:55:36,733 --> 00:55:40,066
- Rearrange things? Why?
- Because it's funny.

825
00:55:40,136 --> 00:55:42,900
Imagine you wake up and
your living room is in your dining room.

826
00:55:42,972 --> 00:55:48,706
Or every single light bulb in your house is
unscrewed and lying on the floor for no reason.

827
00:55:48,778 --> 00:55:51,872
- That's fuckin' funny.
- And you don't take anything?

828
00:55:51,948 --> 00:55:54,007
Not a thing.

829
00:55:54,084 --> 00:55:58,453
So, what about the...
ex... extra "K"?

830
00:55:58,521 --> 00:56:02,252
That's just a little bonus.
You remember Chris Newman?

831
00:56:02,325 --> 00:56:05,886
- Yeah.
- Well, he took over his dad's business.

832
00:56:05,962 --> 00:56:10,228
- Right.
- Newman Home Security.

833
00:56:10,300 --> 00:56:12,495
Oh. Yeah. Still don't get it.

834
00:56:12,569 --> 00:56:15,629
[Sighs]
We live in the burbs.

835
00:56:15,705 --> 00:56:18,071
Not the best place
for a home security business.

836
00:56:18,141 --> 00:56:20,974
When Chris took over his dad's company,
it was headed down the tubes.

837
00:56:21,044 --> 00:56:24,207
So he asked Biscuit and I
to scare up a little business for him.

838
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:28,216
We may be a lot of things, but we are
not thieves. So we thought of this little plan.

839
00:56:28,284 --> 00:56:30,912
We get a few kicks,
we help Chris out a little bit...

840
00:56:30,987 --> 00:56:34,684
and it's kind of thrilling
being in people's houses.

841
00:56:34,758 --> 00:56:38,125
- What if you get caught?
- Oh, no, man, you can't get caught.

842
00:56:38,194 --> 00:56:41,857
- Sure you can.
- No, you can't get caught.

843
00:56:41,931 --> 00:56:46,129
- Don't get caught.
- Oh.

844
00:56:46,202 --> 00:56:48,693
So, are you in?

845
00:56:49,739 --> 00:56:53,004
Am I in? Sure.

846
00:56:53,076 --> 00:56:56,637
I've been making some pretty stellar decisions
lately. I'm sure this will be another one.

847
00:56:56,713 --> 00:56:58,704
Cool. Let's go.

848

[Women Laughing]

850
00:57:08,525 --> 00:57:11,517
[Man]
Does he have both testicles?

851
00:57:13,897 --> 00:57:17,333
- Well, that is until Marty saw him.
- [Man] Oh.

852
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:21,598
Is his penis super glued to his stomach so when
he has to piss, he has to stand on his head?

853
00:57:21,671 --> 00:57:24,105
[All Laughing]

854
00:57:24,174 --> 00:57:26,005
No.

855
00:57:26,075 --> 00:57:30,102
Then you shouldn't be upset. Sounds to me
like you had a pretty reasonable breakup.

856
00:57:30,180 --> 00:57:32,705
It's not the breakup
that I'm so upset about.

857
00:57:32,782 --> 00:57:36,343
I don't know if it was
the right thing to do. You know?

858
00:57:36,419 --> 00:57:40,617
I mean, I felt I had to do it at the time,
but now, I just... I don't know.

859
00:57:40,690 --> 00:57:44,524
Well, look. I mean, you obviously
had planned on marrying this guy.

860
00:57:44,594 --> 00:57:46,653
Everything was done and ready.

861
00:57:46,729 --> 00:57:50,495
But in your heart,
something inside told you not to.

862
00:57:50,567 --> 00:57:52,558
To stop, right?

863
00:57:53,570 --> 00:57:55,538
Yeah, well, l...
I don't know.

864
00:57:55,605 --> 00:57:59,701
It's weird because Jeremy,
all in all, is a pretty good guy.

865
00:57:59,776 --> 00:58:02,404
You know, he's...

866
00:58:02,479 --> 00:58:04,970
He's not mean.
People like him.

867
00:58:05,048 --> 00:58:07,846
And he didn't cheat on me.

868
00:58:07,917 --> 00:58:12,013
He never brought you flowers.
He never did anything romantic for you.

869
00:58:12,088 --> 00:58:16,252
And he always put everything else
before you.

870
00:58:16,326 --> 00:58:18,954
I'm right, aren't I?

871
00:58:19,028 --> 00:58:22,759
Hey, look. I know exactly
what you're going through.

872
00:58:24,601 --> 00:58:30,062
Well, I didn't always live my life
as a gay woman.

873
00:58:30,139 --> 00:58:34,200
Before I met Shelly here,
I was married.

874
00:58:34,277 --> 00:58:36,905
I was married for 12 years
to this man...

875
00:58:36,980 --> 00:58:41,212
who much like Jeremy,
was a pretty good guy.

876
00:58:42,519 --> 00:58:47,582
But then about the third year
of our marriage, everything changed.

877
00:58:47,657 --> 00:58:51,559
- Uh-huh.
- Well, we were still in love...

878
00:58:51,628 --> 00:58:54,358
but it just wasn't the same.

879
00:58:54,430 --> 00:58:58,594
He slipped into like this
comfortable place, you know...

880
00:58:58,668 --> 00:59:02,866
where he didn't think
that he needed to woo me anymore.

881
00:59:02,939 --> 00:59:05,601
And sex, as infrequent as it was...

882
00:59:05,675 --> 00:59:08,439
was boring and predictable.

883
00:59:10,179 --> 00:59:13,671
I swear, I think guys have
some sort of built-in timer.

884
00:59:13,750 --> 00:59:15,581
Uh-huh.

885
00:59:15,652 --> 00:59:18,348
Apparently, everyone thinks this...

886
00:59:18,421 --> 00:59:21,117
because I asked all my married friends
at the time...

887
00:59:21,190 --> 00:59:23,181
you know, "Was this normal?"

888
00:59:23,259 --> 00:59:26,160
And they said,
"Yeah, it was."

889
00:59:27,764 --> 00:59:31,860
Yeah. That's why my marriage
lasted 12 years.

890
00:59:31,935 --> 00:59:35,200
So, what? I either have to
accept this fact about men...

891
00:59:35,271 --> 00:59:37,205
or become a lesbian?

892
00:59:37,273 --> 00:59:40,436
[All Laughing]

893
00:59:40,510 --> 00:59:42,501
No. No.

894
00:59:42,579 --> 00:59:44,877
You just need to find someone...

895
00:59:44,948 --> 00:59:48,008
who will love you
the way you wanna be loved.

896
00:59:48,084 --> 00:59:52,646
You know, in my case, it's just
that person happened to be a woman.

897
00:59:52,722 --> 00:59:56,453
And for you, it could be anybody.

898
00:59:56,526 --> 00:59:59,620
It could be a friend.
It could be somebody you work with.

899
00:59:59,696 --> 01:00:01,664
It might even be Marty.

900
01:00:01,731 --> 01:00:05,360
[Laughs] Sorry, Kerri.
I like my women with bigger tits.

901
01:00:09,472 --> 01:00:13,340
Oh, who knows?
It could even be Jeremy.

902
01:00:13,409 --> 01:00:15,570
He may just need a wake-up call.

903
01:00:17,213 --> 01:00:20,182
- God, it is way too serious at this table.
- Mmm.

904
01:00:20,249 --> 01:00:23,548
Honey, you're coming with me.
Dance, lesbians, dance.

905
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:26,316
Oh, yeah. Come on.
K.C., take your purse.

906
01:00:26,389 --> 01:00:28,687
- It'll be fine.
- Where do you think we are?

907
01:00:28,758 --> 01:00:33,195
I thought your husband was a lying,
cheating scumbag with a gambling problem.

908
01:00:33,262 --> 01:00:36,060
Oh. Did I fail to mention that?

What are you trying to do,
get us thrown in jail?

915
01:01:12,935 --> 01:01:15,631
You try lifting a couch with mittens on.
It ain't easy.

916
01:01:15,705 --> 01:01:21,575
- That's why we don't wear mittens, shit stain.
How the fuck did that dude sleep through that?
- I have no idea. I'm just glad he did.

917
01:01:21,644 --> 01:01:25,045
- Maybe he didn't, dude.
Let's get the fuck outta here!
- So what'd you think, Jer?

918
01:01:25,114 --> 01:01:28,277
Ah, except for pissing myself when I
dropped that couch, it was pretty fun.

919
01:01:28,351 --> 01:01:32,117
It's kind of cool being in someone's house,
knowing you can busted at any minute.

920
01:01:32,188 --> 01:01:35,419
Yeah, I think Newman Home Security
has a new customer.

- I would love to see his face when he sees that.
- This is what my life should be.

922
01:01:40,296 --> 01:01:45,495
If I wanna go out, do something stupid
and illegal with you two shit stains,
I should be able to do it, right?

- Hell yeah!
- Yeah.

924
01:01:47,470 --> 01:01:50,837
What are you agreeing with?
He just called you "shit stain," shit stain.

925
01:01:51,841 --> 01:01:53,866
Dude, that ain't cool.

926

- Hey, jam hands.

- What do you think he's been
doing in there all night?

- Oh!
- Shut up, Kerri! I have not!

930
01:02:10,126 --> 01:02:13,289
Yeah, right. You walk into your room
and stick to the floor.

01:02:13,362 --> 01:02:15,626
Shut up, Kerri!

I told you we were
gonna have fun tonight.

934
01:02:24,140 --> 01:02:27,871
Yeah. Who would've thought that all
I needed was a pep talk from a lesbian?

935
01:02:27,944 --> 01:02:30,504
Yeah, that and five or six magaritas.

- Yeah.

I wish that you were drinking with me.

on the wagon for a few more months.

- I'm sorry. I didn't mean...
- Nah.

940
01:02:45,461 --> 01:02:50,057
- Are you gonna tell your mom?
- Why? So I can hear her tell me
how I screwed up my life...

941
01:02:50,133 --> 01:02:52,431
over and over again
like she always knew I would?

942
01:02:52,502 --> 01:02:55,471
No, thanks. Actually, I don't think
I'm gonna tell her anything.

943
01:02:55,538 --> 01:02:58,473
Just let her think I'm gettin' fat.
That would torture her even more.

944
01:02:58,541 --> 01:03:01,476
Hey. I have an idea.

945
01:03:01,544 --> 01:03:06,709
You move to Vegas,
and you and I raise the kid together.

946
01:03:08,050 --> 01:03:12,885
- All right, no more gay clubs for you.
- No, I'm totally serious. You and I could do it.

947
01:03:12,955 --> 01:03:16,982
Okay. So, the girl who calls her little brother
"jam hands" wants to raise my kid?

948
01:03:17,059 --> 01:03:19,186
No, I don't think so.
[Laughs]

949
01:03:19,262 --> 01:03:23,028
Besides, can you see me pregnant in
the Vegas heat? I'd fuckin' kill somebody.

950
01:03:23,099 --> 01:03:26,125
You know, that's really just
a matter of time, not geography.

951
01:03:26,202 --> 01:03:28,329
You're probably right.

952
01:03:28,404 --> 01:03:31,805
- All right, I better get goin'.
- Oh, come on. Spend the night.

953
01:03:31,874 --> 01:03:35,503
No, thanks. I'm a little particular about
which toilet I spend the morning yakking in.

954
01:03:35,578 --> 01:03:39,173
Mine's got one of those cushiony seats. It's nice.
You can rest your head between wrenches.

955
01:03:39,248 --> 01:03:42,740
Hmm. I might need one of those
in the morning too.

956
01:03:42,819 --> 01:03:45,754
At least your misery'll end
with a Denny's breakfast.

957
01:03:45,822 --> 01:03:48,985
Mine's gonna go on
a little bit longer.

958
01:03:49,058 --> 01:03:51,583
Ooh, Denny's.

come out here for a second?

01:04:01,237 --> 01:04:03,228
Sure, Marty.

963
01:04:04,807 --> 01:04:08,971
Can you do me a huge favor? Kerri and I
were just giving each other breast exams.

964
01:04:09,045 --> 01:04:11,536
She thought she felt something
on one of my boobs.

965
01:04:11,614 --> 01:04:13,946
Do you think you could feel it for me?

966
01:04:18,054 --> 01:04:20,784

You think it's okay?

Can't wait.

You know what? You guys probably
don't even realize how good you got it.

976
01:04:52,855 --> 01:04:55,551
- What do you mean?
- Just bein' single.

977

You don't have to answer to anyone.
You can come and go as you please.

978

You can hang out with anyone you want to.
That's cool.

- Grass is always greener, my friend.

- What's that supposed to mean?
- Well, nothin', really.

982
01:05:11,874 --> 01:05:16,573
It's just that when you were with Kerri, you
probably didn't realize how good you had it.

983
01:05:16,646 --> 01:05:20,582
I mean, bein' single and hangin' out
with Biscuit every night is fun...

984
01:05:20,650 --> 01:05:24,484
but I would gladly trade that in to come home
to somebody who's beautiful and cared about me.

985
01:05:24,553 --> 01:05:27,113
Not if you had to come home
to that person every day.

986
01:05:27,189 --> 01:05:30,556
At least when you're single, you can date
and go out with whoever you want to.

987
01:05:30,626 --> 01:05:33,322
And why do you date or go out
with whoever you want to?

01:05:35,965 --> 01:05:38,900
- What do you mean?
- If it's just to get laid every blue moon...

989
01:05:38,968 --> 01:05:41,334
then, yeah, bein' single is fun.

990
01:05:41,404 --> 01:05:44,805
Most people I know are only dating people
'cause they're trying to find the person...

the rest of their lives with.

'cause you're with Kerri.

994
01:05:54,917 --> 01:05:58,580
'Cause the only thing you're missin'
is wishin' you had someone like her.

995
01:06:01,390 --> 01:06:03,449
So what was all that stuff at the bar?

996
01:06:03,526 --> 01:06:07,519

"I wouldn't wish marriage on my worst enemy."

- You think I made a mistake.

He wouldn't let me have any coffee.

What was your criteria?

1107
01:13:48,624 --> 01:13:52,060
I just tried to find the hottest girl.

1108
01:13:52,127 --> 01:13:56,496
But they were all hot.
So then, I asked the guy, like...

who he would recommend.

1110
01:13:59,034 --> 01:14:01,298

gonna affect his life too.

Can't look at him, Marty.

He's supposed to be my best friend.

going on, I'd just found out I was pregnant.

1141
01:16:04,993 --> 01:16:08,485
I was all set to call the guy and tell him.

1142
01:16:08,564 --> 01:16:12,091
Then when you told me
how Jeremy was acting towards you...

1143
01:16:12,167 --> 01:16:14,158
I decided not to.

1144

I mean, the truth is,
I don't know this guy all that well.

Marty, please don't make
any decisions based on Jeremy.

right? That's gotta say something about him.

Maybe he'll flip out and run away.

01:24:11,546 --> 01:24:15,949
I bet if we would've made it to a light switch,
we would've seen Kerri sittin' with a gun.

1268
01:24:16,017 --> 01:24:18,315
- Or Marty.
- I can't believe you guys are making jokes.

1269
01:24:18,386 --> 01:24:21,150
I almost died. I saw my whole life
pass before my eyes.

1270
01:24:21,222 --> 01:24:24,988
Biscuit saw his whole life flash before
his eyes too. Sadly, he never does get laid.

1271
01:24:25,060 --> 01:24:27,187
Fuck you!
You gonna start the car or what?

1272
01:24:27,262 --> 01:24:31,289
- Seriously, dude. What's goin' on?
- I can't find the fucking keys.

1273
01:24:31,366 --> 01:24:35,200
What the fuck are we gonna do? We gonna
wait here for Bernard Goetz to come get us?

1274
01:24:35,270 --> 01:24:38,967
- That's it. Open the door. I'm gonna walk.
- Dude, you don't even know where you are.

1275
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:41,508
It's New Jersey.
I'll walk to the nearest chemical plant.

1276
01:24:41,576 --> 01:24:44,010
No, seriously, dude.
What are we gonna do?

1277
01:24:44,079 --> 01:24:48,379
I don't know. We'll wait for a little while,
and we'll go back and try and find the keys.

1278
01:24:48,450 --> 01:24:51,681
- I don't know.
- You mean, you'll go back and try to find the keys.

1279
01:24:51,753 --> 01:24:53,846
- Damn straight.
- Oh, nice friends.

1280
01:24:53,922 --> 01:24:57,551
- Hey, I just met ya.
- I wish I never knew you.

1281
01:24:57,625 --> 01:24:59,616
Thanks for letting me stay over.

1282
01:24:59,694 --> 01:25:02,686
Please, Marty,
you don't have to thank me.

1283
01:25:02,764 --> 01:25:05,528
- Is your mom gonna be okay?
- She'll be fine.

1284
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:08,467
- Her friends vodka and tonic
came over to soothe her.
- [Laughs]

1285
01:25:08,536 --> 01:25:14,236
I had to get out of there before the word
"whore" came out of her mouth.
I'd hate to throw her down a flight of stairs.

1286
01:25:14,309 --> 01:25:17,278
She's practically a grandmother
after all.

1287
01:25:19,681 --> 01:25:22,775
- You know, that's the first thing
she said when I told her.
- Hmm?

1288
01:25:22,851 --> 01:25:24,785
"I'm too young to be a grandmother."

1289
01:25:24,853 --> 01:25:27,583
Not, "How are you?
Do you need anything? You okay?"

1290
01:25:27,655 --> 01:25:30,123
"I'm too young to be a grandmother."

1291
01:25:30,191 --> 01:25:34,821
Nice. Well, you know, if you ever need to,
you can always stay here.

1292
01:25:34,896 --> 01:25:37,888
My parents would love that.
Cliff would love that.

1293
01:25:37,966 --> 01:25:41,493
[Chuckles]
I can't live here, Kerri.

1294
01:25:41,569 --> 01:25:45,437
In six months, I won't be able to lift
the mattress. How would I get my underwear?

1295
01:25:45,507 --> 01:25:47,441
[Chuckles]
Good night, Marty.

1296
01:25:47,509 --> 01:25:49,500
Good night, Kerri.

1297
01:26:08,763 --> 01:26:10,958
- Move!
- [Jeremy] What the hell's going on?

1298
01:26:11,032 --> 01:26:13,728
Good morning, ladies.
I got the keys.

1299
01:26:13,801 --> 01:26:16,770
- Where were they?
- They were right on the edge of the guy's pool.

1300
01:26:16,838 --> 01:26:19,966
One more inch and I would have
spent the morning swimming.

1301
01:26:20,975 --> 01:26:22,909
- Is he all right?
- Biscuit?

1302
01:26:22,977 --> 01:26:25,070
- [Biscuit] What?
- He's fine.

1303
01:26:25,146 --> 01:26:27,171
So, you guys want breakfast?

1304
01:26:27,248 --> 01:26:29,580
Yeah, we gotta make one stop first.

1305
01:27:07,789 --> 01:27:10,121
Jeremy, what are you doing here?

1306
01:27:10,191 --> 01:27:12,819
You know what this is?

1307
01:27:12,894 --> 01:27:14,919
- A ratty old hat?
- No.

1308
01:27:14,996 --> 01:27:16,987
This.

1309
01:27:18,366 --> 01:27:23,360
- A hole in a ratty old hat?
- No. It's a sign from God. Look at my ear.

1310
01:27:23,438 --> 01:27:28,102
- Is it bleeding?
- A little. Jeremy, what's going on?

1311
01:27:28,176 --> 01:27:32,340
I almost died last night.
I got shot. Well, almost.

1312
01:27:32,413 --> 01:27:35,507
- It went right through my hat.
- What are you talking about?

1313
01:27:35,583 --> 01:27:38,245
- Who tried to shoot at you?
- I bet it was those guys.

1314
01:27:38,319 --> 01:27:41,288
- It wasn't them. It was just some guy.
- Jeremy, this is not funny.

1315
01:27:41,356 --> 01:27:43,449
Kerri, I need to talk to you.

1316
01:27:43,524 --> 01:27:45,515
Could we please talk?

1317
01:27:46,561 --> 01:27:48,995
Come on.

1318
01:27:50,965 --> 01:27:53,934
[Groans]
Fine. I'll wait out here.

1319
01:28:04,712 --> 01:28:08,011
I can't believe this.

1320
01:28:08,082 --> 01:28:11,950
Kerri, I need to know
what's going on.

1321
01:28:12,020 --> 01:28:14,386
With what?

1322
01:28:14,455 --> 01:28:18,323
All right. Don't be flippant, okay?
I need to know what's going on with us.

1323
01:28:18,393 --> 01:28:21,760
I need to know...
to know what happened.

1324
01:28:22,897 --> 01:28:25,491
When we called off the wedding...

1325
01:28:25,566 --> 01:28:28,000
and you moved out,
what did you think was happening?

1326
01:28:28,069 --> 01:28:30,264
I don't know.

1327
01:28:30,338 --> 01:28:32,772
I thought...

1328
01:28:32,840 --> 01:28:35,070
I thought you were having
cold feet or something.

1329
01:28:35,143 --> 01:28:38,078
I thought you needed
some time away from me.

1330
01:28:38,146 --> 01:28:40,580
Did you think you were having
cold feet?

1331
01:28:40,648 --> 01:28:42,582
Did you think you needed
time away from me?

1332
01:28:42,650 --> 01:28:44,641
No.

1333
01:28:46,354 --> 01:28:49,414
I'm just... I'm trying
to figure something out here.

1334
01:28:49,490 --> 01:28:54,689
I'm trying to figure out
why you never said anything...

1335
01:28:54,762 --> 01:28:57,356
why you never tried to stop it.

1336
01:28:58,433 --> 01:29:00,833
It was like you were relieved.

1337
01:29:00,902 --> 01:29:03,871
I wasn't relieved. I just didn't
know what the hell was going on.

1338
01:29:03,938 --> 01:29:07,704
We never even fought before.
I mean, not seriously.

1339
01:29:09,410 --> 01:29:11,469
What do you think made me do it?

1340
01:29:13,281 --> 01:29:15,647
I don't know. Maybe you were
seeing someone else.

1341
01:29:15,717 --> 01:29:19,653
Oh, come on, Jeremy. I didn't even
talk to other guys when I was with you.

1342
01:29:19,721 --> 01:29:21,746
Maybe it wasn't a guy.

1343
01:29:21,823 --> 01:29:24,257
What the fuck
is that supposed to mean?

1344
01:29:24,325 --> 01:29:27,453
You ever heard of
the Three Dollar Bill?

1345
01:29:27,528 --> 01:29:29,792
Oh, my God.

1346
01:29:29,864 --> 01:29:34,267
Jeremy, it's not what you think.

1347
01:29:34,335 --> 01:29:38,066
- So you were there last night?
- Yeah, yeah.

1348
01:29:38,139 --> 01:29:40,733
I was there last night, but...

1349
01:29:40,808 --> 01:29:44,574
we just... we wanted to go somewhere
where we wouldn't be hassled by guys.

1350
01:29:44,645 --> 01:29:48,103
That's it. What,
do you think I'm gay?

1351
01:29:48,182 --> 01:29:50,912
What am I supposed to think?
I got transvestites telling me...

1352
01:29:50,985 --> 01:29:55,115
they ran into you at a bar... a gay bar...
and with Marty who's there all the time...

1353
01:29:55,189 --> 01:29:59,523
and now she's sleeping over at your house,
and correct me if I'm wrong, but you guys
are sharing pajamas now.

1354
01:29:59,594 --> 01:30:01,585
What the hell am I supposed to think?

1355
01:30:01,662 --> 01:30:06,099
If you actually think that I left you
because I'm gay...

1356
01:30:06,167 --> 01:30:09,933
you've got some fucking problems.
[Sighs]

1357
01:30:11,539 --> 01:30:16,499
I left because
you took me for granted.

1358
01:30:16,577 --> 01:30:19,637
I left because
you didn't appreciate me.

1359
01:30:19,714 --> 01:30:24,048
Because I was sick of feeling
bad about myself because of you.

1360
01:30:29,023 --> 01:30:31,958
You think that's pretty ridiculous,
don't you?

1361
01:30:32,026 --> 01:30:34,460
So did I at first.

1362
01:30:34,529 --> 01:30:38,966
And when we were sitting on the couch and
I asked you if you wanted to call off the wedding...

1363
01:30:39,033 --> 01:30:41,968
I thought I was being
pretty ridiculous too.

1364
01:30:42,036 --> 01:30:44,937
But imagine my surprise
when you answered back...

1365
01:30:45,006 --> 01:30:47,304
"Why? Is that what you want?"

1366
01:30:48,643 --> 01:30:51,544
Those are the words of a guy
who couldn't give a shit.

1367
01:30:51,612 --> 01:30:55,275
And you further proved that
and blew me away...

1368
01:30:55,349 --> 01:30:59,217
when you moved out
without a care in the world.

1369
01:31:00,721 --> 01:31:04,054
You keep saying that
I'm the one that broke off the wedding.

1370
01:31:04,125 --> 01:31:07,390
We both know that's not true.

1371
01:31:07,462 --> 01:31:10,488
I'm just the first one
who said it out loud.

1372
01:31:18,406 --> 01:31:22,103
- Well, it's just, uh...
- Just say it, Jeremy.

1373
01:31:22,176 --> 01:31:24,167
You can't hurt me anymore.

1374
01:31:25,413 --> 01:31:27,381
I was just scared.

1375
01:31:27,448 --> 01:31:30,076
Scared of what?

1376
01:31:30,151 --> 01:31:32,779
Scared of marrying you.

1377
01:31:33,788 --> 01:31:36,348
Scared of being married.

1378
01:31:37,992 --> 01:31:41,826
We've been together a long time, Kerri,
since we were kids.

1379
01:31:41,896 --> 01:31:44,364
We've missed out on a lot.

1380
01:31:49,170 --> 01:31:53,539
When I get married,
I'm only gonna do it once.

1381
01:31:53,608 --> 01:31:56,975
It's forever. I don't want you or me
five or 10 years from now...

1382
01:31:57,044 --> 01:32:01,140
to wonder if there was
something better out there.

1383
01:32:01,215 --> 01:32:03,706
I never wondered, Jeremy.

1384
01:32:05,820 --> 01:32:09,916
Neither did I. I just thought that maybe
we weren't ready to get married
and you felt it too.

1385
01:32:09,991 --> 01:32:13,586
I thought after we called off the wedding,
everything would go back to the way it was.

1386
01:32:13,661 --> 01:32:17,358
Oh. So we were just supposed to
pretend that nothing happened?

1387
01:32:17,431 --> 01:32:20,958
So, I get it. You're not cold and callous.
You're just stupid.

1388
01:32:21,035 --> 01:32:26,530
I never intended to lose you, Kerri.
You've gotta believe that.

1389
01:32:26,607 --> 01:32:31,510
Do you have... Do you have any idea
what you put me through?

1390
01:32:31,579 --> 01:32:35,845
Why couldn't you just
share your big idea with me?

1391
01:32:35,917 --> 01:32:38,545
Instead, you acted indifferent
through the whole thing...

1392
01:32:38,619 --> 01:32:41,486
and made me feel like
I was living in some fucking dream world.

1393
01:32:41,556 --> 01:32:44,024
I'm so sorry, Ker.

1394
01:32:44,091 --> 01:32:47,151
I'm so sorry.
Please, give me another chance.

1395
01:32:48,296 --> 01:32:51,094
I've given you chances, Jeremy.

1396
01:32:51,165 --> 01:32:54,225
And if you're asking me
for another one...

1397
01:32:54,302 --> 01:32:56,463
the answer's "no."

1398
01:32:56,537 --> 01:33:02,032
Because you lost me
long before you called off the wedding.

1399
01:33:02,109 --> 01:33:05,943
- What are you talking about?
- [Sighs]

1400
01:33:06,013 --> 01:33:09,278
When was the last time
you bought me flowers...

1401
01:33:09,350 --> 01:33:14,947
or... or sent me a love note
or said "I love you" before I did?

1402
01:33:15,022 --> 01:33:18,355
Jesus, just because I didn't do those things
doesn't mean I don't love you.

1403
01:33:18,426 --> 01:33:21,156
- You know I love you.
- I know, Jeremy.

1404
01:33:21,228 --> 01:33:24,493
But just because you send someone
flowers or a little note...

1405
01:33:24,565 --> 01:33:26,499
doesn't mean you love them.

1406
01:33:26,567 --> 01:33:31,334
But it's those things combined
with everything else that reassures a person.

1407
01:33:32,907 --> 01:33:36,172
I just needed to be reassured.

1408
01:33:38,613 --> 01:33:42,743
Kerri, my God, if I knew I would lose you
by not doing those things...

1409
01:33:42,817 --> 01:33:45,752
I would buy you flowers every day.

1410
01:33:50,091 --> 01:33:54,187
I will do whatever it takes
to show you I love you...

1411
01:33:54,261 --> 01:33:57,662
not just today or tomorrow,
but every day.

1412
01:33:58,666 --> 01:34:02,500
I would marry you right now if I even thought
for a second you would have me.

1413
01:34:02,570 --> 01:34:06,836
I swear I would. And I don't expect you
to take me back, but...

1414
01:34:06,907 --> 01:34:10,343
please let me try
and prove myself to you.

1415
01:34:14,281 --> 01:34:16,215
Kerri, I love you.

1416
01:34:16,283 --> 01:34:18,843
[Door Opens]

1417
01:34:18,919 --> 01:34:23,822
Uh, Kerri, could you come outside?
Marty's beating the crap out of Biscuit.

1418
01:34:23,891 --> 01:34:25,882
What?

1419
01:34:28,129 --> 01:34:31,621
- [Jeremy] What happened?
- Biscuit told Marty he wanted to become
her and Kerri's manager...

1420
01:34:31,699 --> 01:34:33,758
and watch 'em go at it,
and she flipped out.

1421
01:34:33,834 --> 01:34:35,768
- [Kerri] Manager?
- [Jeremy] Huh?

1422
01:34:35,836 --> 01:34:38,464
- Come on, Marty.
- [Marty Grunting]

1423
01:34:38,539 --> 01:34:41,269
Come on, sweetheart. Let's go.
One more. One more.

1424
01:34:41,342 --> 01:34:43,537
- All right, enough.
- [Kerri] Marty, the baby!

1425
01:34:43,611 --> 01:34:46,444
- Don't call me a baby!
- Not you, asshole! She's pregnant!

1426
01:34:46,514 --> 01:34:50,314
- Kerri!
- Ooh, is it mine?

1427
01:34:50,384 --> 01:34:52,852
- Shut the fuck up, Biscuit!
- Ow!

1428
01:34:53,854 --> 01:34:56,015
It's mine, isn't it?

1429
01:34:58,993 --> 01:35:01,587
Not exactly the way
I wanted you to find out.

1430
01:35:05,566 --> 01:35:07,625
You slept with Marty?

1431
01:35:10,137 --> 01:35:12,469
You slept with Marty,
and you didn't tell me?

1432
01:35:12,540 --> 01:35:15,737
- This is the businessman?
- I didn't say he was a businessman.

1433
01:35:15,810 --> 01:35:18,301
I said he owned his own business.

1434
01:35:18,379 --> 01:35:20,347
Lawn Wranglers is hardly a business.

1435
01:35:20,414 --> 01:35:24,043
- Hey, it's a business.
- Marty is having my kid.

1436
01:35:24,118 --> 01:35:27,952
- Our kid.
- Our kid.

1437
01:35:28,022 --> 01:35:31,981
Well, at least you won't have to
pick out a name. Damien will do.

1438
01:35:32,059 --> 01:35:34,892
Look, Marty...

1439
01:35:34,962 --> 01:35:38,022
I know you're probably less
than thrilled about this, but...

1440
01:35:38,099 --> 01:35:40,727
I want you to know
I'll do my part, whatever it is.

1441
01:35:40,801 --> 01:35:43,895
I mean, if you just want me
to go away...

1442
01:35:43,971 --> 01:35:46,804
I won't like it, but I'll do it.

1443
01:35:46,874 --> 01:35:51,868
If you want me to be there,
I'll be there every step of the way.

1444
01:36:05,226 --> 01:36:07,217
I'm sorry.

1445
01:36:21,876 --> 01:36:25,471
- [Gil] Are you guys sure about this?
- Of course we're sure about this.

1446
01:36:25,546 --> 01:36:27,639
Yeah, but this is your honeymoon.

1447
01:36:27,715 --> 01:36:30,912
See a ring on this finger? Seriously,
this is supposed to be our honeymoon...

1448
01:36:30,985 --> 01:36:33,852
and we wouldn't enjoy it
knowing it's not.

1449
01:36:33,921 --> 01:36:37,550
- Plus, it's a good chance
for you two to spend some time together.
- And it's Disney World.

1450
01:36:37,625 --> 01:36:42,995
- You get a little dose of hyped-up kids
to show you what you're in for.
- [Chuckles]

1451
01:36:44,131 --> 01:36:46,224
Speaking of hyped-up kids,
where's Biscuit?

1452
01:36:46,300 --> 01:36:48,928
- He said he was coming
to the airport this morning.
- Yeah.

1453
01:36:49,003 --> 01:36:51,995
Oh, he's giving Shane a little
going-away present for me.

1454
01:36:52,072 --> 01:36:54,233
- Is Shane going back today?
- Maybe.

1455
01:36:54,308 --> 01:36:57,800
[Woman Over P.A.]
Flight 67 from Newark to Miami...

1456
01:36:57,878 --> 01:36:59,869
You guys should get on the plane.

1457
01:36:59,947 --> 01:37:03,678
- Okay. Thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

1458
01:37:03,751 --> 01:37:07,312
- You got those, big guy?
- Yeah, I got these.

1459
01:37:07,388 --> 01:37:10,380
- You wanna help me out? You can help me.
- You're a weak man.

1460
01:37:10,457 --> 01:37:13,085
- [Kerri] Have a nice time.
- I'll call you when I get back.

1461
01:37:13,160 --> 01:37:15,094
- [Gil] See you, man.
- [Marty] I love you.

1462
01:37:15,162 --> 01:37:17,096
- Bring me back the ears.
- I will.

1463
01:37:17,164 --> 01:37:19,530
- Jer. [Grunts]
- [Jeremy] Ooh. See that?

1464
01:37:19,600 --> 01:37:22,000
- Just kidding. Bye.
- Humor. That's good.

1465
01:37:22,069 --> 01:37:24,128
- [Gil] See you.
- [Kerri] Bye, guys.

1466
01:37:24,205 --> 01:37:28,107
- You realize they're gonna kill
each other, don't you?
- Absolutely.

1467
01:37:28,175 --> 01:37:30,643
[Alarm Beeping]

1468
01:37:30,711 --> 01:37:33,646
[Shane] Okay, I am telling you
that it's just a joke.

1469
01:37:33,714 --> 01:37:36,182
Sir, I can't let you on the plane
with that thing on.

1470
01:37:36,250 --> 01:37:40,311
[Chuckles] Okay. What am I gonna do?
Throw it through the window and kill us all?

1471
01:37:40,387 --> 01:37:43,652
- Sir, step out of line and let
the other people through.
- Okay!

1472
01:37:43,724 --> 01:37:45,954
My plane is leaving!

1473
01:37:46,026 --> 01:37:48,051
[Guard]
Step out of line, sir.
