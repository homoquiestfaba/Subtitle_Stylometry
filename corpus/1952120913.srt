1
00:00:03,303 --> 00:00:05,305
[Scattered Groans] [Man]
It's been three days!

2
00:00:09,309 --> 00:00:11,811
We're starving!
Where's our food?

3
00:00:16,816 --> 00:00:18,818
Shut up, ya scum!

4
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,288
Give me some!
Give me some!

5
00:00:23,288 --> 00:00:26,075
I swear it's true.
The Sword of Hera is real.

6
00:00:26,075 --> 00:00:28,793
Some people are dumb enough
to believe anything.

7
00:00:28,793 --> 00:00:33,333
I saw a damn map. Now, why'd
that be if the sword wasn't real?

8
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:35,785
I think I know a way
to settle this.

9
00:00:37,787 --> 00:00:39,754
We go after it.

10
00:00:39,754 --> 00:00:42,776
No one's talkin' to you,
woman.

11
00:00:47,781 --> 00:00:50,248
Lemme ask you something.

12
00:00:50,248 --> 00:00:53,219
When you got your nose pierced,
did it hurt?

13
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:55,688
Not after a couple
mugs of mead. Yeah.

14
00:00:56,189 --> 00:00:59,192
It's too bad they don't
let us drink in here, huh?

15
00:00:59,192 --> 00:01:01,194
Yeah? Why's that?

16
00:01:05,698 --> 00:01:07,634
[Ripping]
[Yelling]

17
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:12,472
That's it, Arciana!

18
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:17,410
You just bought yourself
a night in the hole.

19
00:01:35,712 --> 00:01:38,129
Gimme the keys!

20
00:01:38,129 --> 00:01:40,617
I'm going after the sword!

21
00:01:41,117 --> 00:01:45,121
The rest of you can stay in here
and rot, or come with me and live!

22
00:01:45,622 --> 00:01:47,590
[Cheers, Shouts]

23
00:01:54,481 --> 00:01:58,485
That is the last time I let
you drag me off to see a play.

24
00:02:00,153 --> 00:02:02,520
When did you become
such a philistine?

25
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:06,159
Look, if you're gonna insult me,
at least use words I can understand.

26
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,128
Maybe you didn't like it
because you didn't get it.

27
00:02:10,128 --> 00:02:12,931
What's to get? This guy gets
some money from some pirates,

28
00:02:12,931 --> 00:02:16,469
he goes traveling around the world, and
then just before he gets to where he's going,

29
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:19,472
he falls in the sea, and he's got so
much gold in his pockets, he drowns!

30
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:22,941
- Whoo!
- That's just the plot.

31
00:02:22,941 --> 00:02:25,845
- Yeah?
- Well, there's the meaning.

32
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:30,542
Okay, okay. Enlighten me.

33
00:02:30,542 --> 00:02:33,485
Okay. Never accept gifts...

34
00:02:33,485 --> 00:02:36,523
paid for by
other people's suffering.

35
00:02:36,523 --> 00:02:39,424
What about my suffering?

36
00:02:39,424 --> 00:02:41,494
Listen, they could just come
out and say it, couldn't they?

37
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:43,930
Hercules!
There's been a prison break.

38
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:46,898
Inmate by the name of Arciana
took off with a posse.

39
00:02:46,898 --> 00:02:50,603
Word is they're headin' toward
Mycenae. Sure could use your help.

40
00:02:50,603 --> 00:02:53,957
You got it. Well, looks
like we're going to Mycenae.

41
00:02:53,957 --> 00:02:57,277
- Hope they haven't got any theater there.
- Uh, sir...

42
00:02:57,277 --> 00:02:59,279
Did he pay for that?

43
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,882
Thank you, sir.
Keep the change.

44
00:03:06,119 --> 00:03:08,621
So the bartender
says to the horse,

45
00:03:09,622 --> 00:03:11,624
"Why the long face?"

46
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:13,993
Get it?
[Laughing]

47
00:03:14,494 --> 00:03:17,380
Don't quit your day job.

48
00:03:35,031 --> 00:03:37,984
Damn!
[Panting]

49
00:03:42,805 --> 00:03:46,175
[Panicked Yelping,
Screaming]

50
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:06,663
- I'm sure you've heard of Hercules. Yes?
- Uh-huh.

51
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:11,100
Good, because I need you
to send him a message.

52
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:17,290
[Man Narrating] This is the
story of a time long ago,

53
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:19,157
a time of myth and legend,

54
00:04:19,157 --> 00:04:22,095
when the ancient gods
were petty and cruel,

55
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:25,063
and they plagued mankind
with suffering.

56
00:04:25,063 --> 00:04:28,668
Only one man dared
to challenge their power...

57
00:04:28,668 --> 00:04:31,035
Hercules.

58
00:04:31,035 --> 00:04:34,373
Hercules possessed a strength
the world had never seen,

59
00:04:34,373 --> 00:04:37,642
a strength surpassed
only by the power of his heart.

60
00:04:37,642 --> 00:04:41,297
He journeyed the earth, battling the
minions of his wicked stepmother, Hera,

61
00:04:41,297 --> 00:04:44,417
the all-powerful
queen of the gods.

62
00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:46,251
But wherever
there was evil,

63
00:04:46,251 --> 00:04:49,722
wherever an innocent
would suffer,

64
00:04:49,722 --> 00:04:51,975
there would be... Hercules.

65
00:04:51,975 --> 00:04:54,193
- [Screeching]
- [Roaring]

66
00:05:08,958 --> 00:05:09,876
Hail!

67
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:26,734
[Lolaus] I guess they don't
make prisons like they used to.

68
00:05:26,734 --> 00:05:29,812
Hmm. I wonder what the inmates
are looking for in Mycenae.

69
00:05:29,812 --> 00:05:32,780
Maybe it's
the four-star restaurants.

70
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:37,820
Or maybe they're after the Sword
of Hera. Okay, that's a new one.

71
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:40,256
No, not really.
It's been around a long time.

72
00:05:40,656 --> 00:05:43,860
Disciples move it from temple
to temple to keep it hidden.

73
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:45,862
Closest one's in Mycenae.

74
00:05:46,262 --> 00:05:49,082
And let me guess: He who
possesseth the sword...

75
00:05:49,482 --> 00:05:52,250
shall pierce his enemies
unto the quick, yea,

76
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:56,622
and smite them into the blood-bespattered
earth of their forefathers.

77
00:05:56,622 --> 00:05:59,625
And I thought you didn't
like theater. [Laughs]

78
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:01,911
[Whooshing]

79
00:06:01,911 --> 00:06:04,163
[Bird Cawing]

80
00:06:04,664 --> 00:06:08,101
Said the serpent to the man,

81
00:06:08,501 --> 00:06:10,903
"To know me
is to know yourself."

82
00:06:15,575 --> 00:06:19,379
[Serena]
You take my breath away.

83
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:22,682
[Hercules] Nothing can keep
me from coming back to you.

84
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:25,550
Nothing.

85
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:28,488
My husband was lost at sea
two moons ago.

86
00:06:28,488 --> 00:06:30,857
An oracle told me
he's still alive.

87
00:06:31,357 --> 00:06:33,776
Why do I feel like
I know that girl?

88
00:06:34,277 --> 00:06:38,498
In another life...
she was my wife.

89
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:43,936
- Serena.
- I've missed you, Hercules.

90
00:06:48,791 --> 00:06:51,592
How's your husband?

91
00:06:51,592 --> 00:06:56,432
- Well, he's no Hercules.
- And you're no Serena.

92
00:06:56,432 --> 00:06:59,600
I'm whoever you
want me to be.

93
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,038
I've chosen to appear
in this form because...

94
00:07:02,038 --> 00:07:04,939
it's pleasing to you.

95
00:07:04,939 --> 00:07:08,628
Actually, it's insulting.
Who are you?

96
00:07:09,829 --> 00:07:14,165
Why don't you call me "Sin"?

97
00:07:14,165 --> 00:07:17,437
We have an old acquaintance
in common, you and I.

98
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,839
Does the name
"Xerxos" ring a bell?

99
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:22,723
Xerxos is dead.

100
00:07:22,723 --> 00:07:27,613
Ooh. Dead to your world...
reborn in mine.

101
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:30,658
But he's escaped my domain.

102
00:07:30,658 --> 00:07:33,634
- Your domain?
- Mm-hmm.

103
00:07:33,634 --> 00:07:36,472
See, Tartarus is too good
for some people.

104
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:41,294
When Hades finds a special case,
he... he sends them to me.

105
00:07:43,646 --> 00:07:46,532
I want you to help me
bring him back.

106
00:07:47,033 --> 00:07:50,036
Huh! What makes you think
I'd help you?

107
00:07:50,036 --> 00:07:52,104
Because you know Xerxos,

108
00:07:53,606 --> 00:07:56,841
and you know
what he's capable of.

109
00:07:56,841 --> 00:08:01,681
I'll admit, Hercules. There have
been times I cursed your name.

110
00:08:01,681 --> 00:08:04,083
You kept so many
from entering my domain.

111
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:08,421
But you see,
we need each other now.

112
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:10,423
I doubt it.

113
00:08:13,292 --> 00:08:15,259
My powers are weak
in this realm.

114
00:08:15,259 --> 00:08:18,898
Only our combined strength
will bring Xerxos to his knees.

115
00:08:19,298 --> 00:08:22,585
- Thanks, but I already have a partner.
- Yeah, and we work alone.

116
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:25,004
Then as a gesture
of goodwill,

117
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:28,007
let me offer you boys
a little tip.

118
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:31,177
Xerxos is headed
to Mycenae.

119
00:08:35,581 --> 00:08:37,967
We'll meet again.

120
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:46,824
Boy, Mycenae sure is
popular today.

121
00:08:46,824 --> 00:08:50,296
If this guy is really back, we have
to stop him before we find Arciana.

122
00:08:50,296 --> 00:08:52,263
Wh-Wha... Who is he?

123
00:08:52,263 --> 00:08:55,234
When you were a kid, did you ever
hear stories about the bogeyman?

124
00:08:55,635 --> 00:08:59,539
- Yeah, but everybody did.
- Well, he's real.

125
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:02,341
His name is Xerxos.

126
00:09:02,742 --> 00:09:06,212
His first victims were his
own family. [Muffled Screams]

127
00:09:13,953 --> 00:09:16,739
He was caught the next day, and
when the magistrate asked him...

128
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,659
if he had anything
to say for himself,

129
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:23,145
he said...

130
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:25,613
Yeah, I enjoyed it.

131
00:09:25,613 --> 00:09:29,076
He was the first juvenile
ever sentenced to death.

132
00:09:29,076 --> 00:09:32,470
But before the execution,
he broke out of prison.

133
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:35,690
After that, Xerxos was blamed for
every murder that ever went unsolved.

134
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:40,212
How do you know all this? Because I'm the one
who finally caught him and brought him back.

135
00:09:40,713 --> 00:09:42,680
To be executed?
Yeah.

136
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,717
Whoa. Then he owes you one.
I'm sure that's how he sees it.

137
00:09:45,217 --> 00:09:48,220
Hercules, I know I don't have
to tell you to be careful,

138
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:50,723
but be careful.

139
00:09:51,223 --> 00:09:52,725
That Serena look-alike...

140
00:09:53,225 --> 00:09:55,962
It's obvious she wanted
more from you than just help.

141
00:09:55,962 --> 00:09:58,447
I know.
[Bird Cawing]

142
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:24,957
What's it say?

143
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:29,795
"I enjoyed it."

144
00:10:48,214 --> 00:10:50,181
Old habits die hard.

145
00:10:50,181 --> 00:10:53,202
Yeah. That's not the
only thing. [Sword Clanks]

146
00:10:53,703 --> 00:10:56,205
Ooh! This guy's
seriously disturbed.

147
00:10:56,706 --> 00:10:59,208
[Serena Giggles]
Now that's putting it mildly.

148
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:05,164
When Xerxos escaped from me, he
took the power of my realm with him.

149
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:07,166
Not even a god
can stop him now.

150
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:12,621
Maybe I didn't make myself clear.
I'm not interested in your help.

151
00:11:12,621 --> 00:11:15,558
You're gonna have to spell
it out for her, Hercules.

152
00:11:16,058 --> 00:11:19,061
[Thinking] You should learn
to hold your tongue, Lolaus.

153
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:23,464
Maybe I didn't
make myself clear.

154
00:11:23,464 --> 00:11:25,950
Without my power,
you won't succeed.

155
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:29,922
And you're doing this, uh, out of
the goodness of your heart, right?

156
00:11:29,922 --> 00:11:32,667
I don't like loose ends.
Xerxos is mine!

157
00:11:32,667 --> 00:11:35,378
I want him back!
Isn't that nice, Lolaus?

158
00:11:35,378 --> 00:11:37,606
- [Scoffs]
- Come on.

159
00:11:37,606 --> 00:11:39,799
We have graves to dig.

160
00:11:40,299 --> 00:11:44,303
You know, Hercules, pride has
always been my favorite sin.

161
00:11:44,804 --> 00:11:48,174
I just hope yours doesn't cost any
more innocent people their lives.

162
00:11:57,066 --> 00:12:00,019
[Scattered Chattering]

163
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:03,522
[Man] I'll meet you
over there! Hey!

164
00:12:03,522 --> 00:12:06,025
It's not her.

165
00:12:06,525 --> 00:12:08,527
Whoa!
We're looking for a woman.

166
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:11,981
Her name's Arciana.

167
00:12:12,481 --> 00:12:15,175
She's an escaped convict.

168
00:12:15,175 --> 00:12:17,870
[Xerxos]
I've seen her.

169
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:25,377
She's camped in the forest.

170
00:12:25,878 --> 00:12:27,880
I could take you to her.

171
00:12:44,964 --> 00:12:47,364
What did this girl
do anyway?

172
00:12:47,364 --> 00:12:51,368
She killed one of my
men. Ha-ha! Only one?

173
00:12:51,368 --> 00:12:55,407
What do you mean by that? Well,
here's a question for you:

174
00:12:55,908 --> 00:12:59,411
What kind of a man decides to
make his living as a prison guard?

175
00:12:59,912 --> 00:13:02,915
The kind that wants to see
people get what they deserve.

176
00:13:02,915 --> 00:13:07,419
Ahh. You like to watch
people suffer, do you?

177
00:13:09,722 --> 00:13:11,907
I know the feeling.

178
00:13:11,907 --> 00:13:13,843
[Roars]

179
00:13:14,343 --> 00:13:16,812
[Guards Screaming, Distant]

180
00:13:21,817 --> 00:13:24,286
Aah! Get outta here!
Into the woods!

181
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:32,817
Xerxos!

182
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:38,199
I see you got my message.

183
00:13:38,199 --> 00:13:41,203
We'll see how much
you enjoy my reply.

184
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:11,833
Heh!

185
00:14:14,053 --> 00:14:18,274
Oh, now you're gonna have to
do a whole lot better than that.

186
00:14:22,845 --> 00:14:25,262
[Laughing]

187
00:14:25,262 --> 00:14:27,716
Come on, little man.
Show me your stuff.

188
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:33,672
Oh, gods!

189
00:14:34,673 --> 00:14:37,760
Hoo! Yaah!

190
00:14:46,402 --> 00:14:47,842
No. Not yet.

191
00:14:50,406 --> 00:14:53,842
I wouldn't wanna deprive myself
the pleasure of seeing your face...

192
00:14:53,842 --> 00:14:57,329
twist in anger
with every new life I take.

193
00:14:58,781 --> 00:15:01,250
Their blood
is on your hands.

194
00:15:07,273 --> 00:15:09,775
[Laughing]

195
00:15:10,276 --> 00:15:12,211
Catch me later.

196
00:15:23,122 --> 00:15:25,122
[Both Groaning]

197
00:15:25,122 --> 00:15:28,560
You all right?
Ooh, never better.

198
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,964
[Blows Nose]
[Serena Laughing]

199
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:37,169
He'll kill again, Hercules.
Count on it.

200
00:15:37,169 --> 00:15:39,136
[Groans]
Uh!

201
00:15:39,136 --> 00:15:41,740
Let me give you
the strength to stop him.

202
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:44,310
I can stop him without you.
Probably.

203
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:49,198
Eventually. But how many people
will die in the process?

204
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:53,686
With my power,
you can do it faster.

205
00:15:53,686 --> 00:15:56,622
Don't listen to her,
Hercules.

206
00:15:58,057 --> 00:16:00,926
- Hercules, don't listen...
- She might be right.

207
00:16:00,926 --> 00:16:03,796
You can't... This is only
the beginning, Lolaus.

208
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:05,965
How can you trust her?

209
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:09,468
I don't. But it doesn't look
like I have a choice.

210
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:13,472
[Laughing]
I knew you'd see it my way.

211
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:19,376
What are you doing?

212
00:16:19,376 --> 00:16:23,265
Giving you my power. Or would
you prefer a lightning bolt?

213
00:16:23,265 --> 00:16:25,267
Just get it over with.

214
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:35,610
Huh!

215
00:16:40,466 --> 00:16:43,550
Herc? You all right?

216
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:46,989
He's all right, all right.
He's stronger than ever.

217
00:16:46,989 --> 00:16:50,442
I've given you the power
to defeat Xerxos.

218
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:53,877
He's after me, Lolaus.

219
00:16:53,877 --> 00:16:57,583
I don't wanna make you a target.
You go after Arciana.

220
00:16:57,583 --> 00:16:59,585
Wait a second. I
go where you go. Oh.

221
00:17:00,085 --> 00:17:03,005
There is something
you should know...

222
00:17:03,005 --> 00:17:05,858
now that we're
all a... team.

223
00:17:06,258 --> 00:17:10,496
I don't know if Xerxos was just careless
the night he set fire to his home,

224
00:17:10,496 --> 00:17:13,999
but he left someone alive.

225
00:17:13,999 --> 00:17:15,934
[Parents Screaming]

226
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:26,729
Arciana. That's his sister.

227
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:30,681
If she's as bad as he is...
Oh, no.

228
00:17:30,681 --> 00:17:34,670
Unfortunately, she's not. You see,
she wasn't born a rotten apple,

229
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:37,589
but her upbringing left
something to be desired,

230
00:17:37,589 --> 00:17:40,057
jumping from orphanage
to orphanage.

231
00:17:40,057 --> 00:17:43,494
It's hard not to grow up bitter,
wouldn't you think?

232
00:17:43,494 --> 00:17:47,349
If she gets her hands on that sword,
she'll take her bitterness out on the world.

233
00:17:47,349 --> 00:17:50,269
We find Arciana,
we find Xerxos.

234
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:55,107
Where is the sword?
It isn't here!

235
00:17:55,524 --> 00:17:58,208
And even if I knew where it was,
I wouldn't tell you!

236
00:17:58,208 --> 00:18:01,747
Oh, so you would pay for your loyalty to Hera
with your life. All the gods hear our prayers!

237
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:05,684
We owe them our allegiance!
The gods are laughing at us.

238
00:18:05,684 --> 00:18:08,652
You know, I prayed
for their help once.

239
00:18:08,652 --> 00:18:12,691
But my prayers, they were
ignored. That was their right.

240
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:16,110
[Wheezes, Coughs]

241
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:19,398
- It was their mistake.
- [Grunts]

242
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:24,670
Burn this place to the ground.
[Man] You heard her. Let's go.

243
00:18:37,149 --> 00:18:39,917
They don't get
many visitors.

244
00:18:39,917 --> 00:18:44,306
Girl used to come by and
drop off flowers, but...

245
00:18:44,306 --> 00:18:46,809
haven't seen her
in a long time.

246
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:52,030
She tell you her name? Oh,
it was quite a while ago.

247
00:18:52,481 --> 00:18:54,867
I think she said her
name was, uh, Arciana?

248
00:18:54,867 --> 00:18:57,768
Don't hold me to it.

249
00:18:57,768 --> 00:19:01,006
Shame what happened
to her folks.

250
00:19:03,008 --> 00:19:05,811
Really?
What happened to them?

251
00:19:09,581 --> 00:19:13,051
They gave birth to a monster.

252
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:20,242
You tell me something,
gravetender.

253
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:24,963
You think a monster
can grow a conscience?

254
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:28,567
I wonder what Xerxos
wants with his sister?

255
00:19:28,567 --> 00:19:30,969
Maybe he came back to
finish what he started.

256
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:34,538
Or maybe he wants to team up
with her again. It doesn't matter.

257
00:19:34,538 --> 00:19:37,976
Xerxos is going back where he came
from, and I'm sending Arciana with him.

258
00:19:37,976 --> 00:19:41,380
[Laughs] Hercules, l... I know she's
not the world's most model citizen,

259
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:44,214
but we don't know if
she's as bad as Xerxos.

260
00:19:44,214 --> 00:19:47,252
They share the same blood. That's
all I need to know. Are you okay?

261
00:19:47,753 --> 00:19:51,221
Fine. You don't sound
like your normal self.

262
00:19:51,221 --> 00:19:57,212
What's that supposed to mean? It means, since
when has robbery been punishable by death?

263
00:20:00,165 --> 00:20:03,669
Aren't you tired of giving people
the benefit of the doubt, Lolaus?

264
00:20:04,169 --> 00:20:07,639
Of having them disappoint
you over and over again.

265
00:20:07,639 --> 00:20:09,523
They're criminals.

266
00:20:09,523 --> 00:20:12,477
Now, that's reason enough
to kill them both.

267
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:17,816
[Scattered Chattering]
[Woman] Seven times.

268
00:20:25,824 --> 00:20:27,826
What price?

269
00:20:29,027 --> 00:20:31,187
It's cheaper.

270
00:20:31,187 --> 00:20:33,348
To your health.

271
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:43,240
Excuse me. Hey!

272
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:47,679
Thank you. I'm looking
for a woman named Arciana.

273
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:49,765
Has anyone seen her?

274
00:20:51,266 --> 00:20:53,852
You're the second guy
to ask about her.

275
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:59,341
And this guy let you live? [Laughs]
What sort of question is that?

276
00:21:01,827 --> 00:21:04,830
Uh, which way did he go?

277
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:09,785
Well, I'm answering so many questions,
I should start charging for my time.

278
00:21:09,785 --> 00:21:12,619
What's it worth to you?

279
00:21:12,619 --> 00:21:16,333
What's it worth to me?
You heard.

280
00:21:16,333 --> 00:21:20,012
You want answers...
gonna cost ya.

281
00:21:21,013 --> 00:21:23,563
[Groaning]

282
00:21:23,563 --> 00:21:28,053
Sorry, I, uh...
I'm a little hard of hearing.

283
00:21:28,553 --> 00:21:31,021
You were about to tell me which
direction this guy was headed.

284
00:21:31,021 --> 00:21:34,977
Hercules, he won't be able to tell
you anything if you're choking him.

285
00:21:34,977 --> 00:21:35,977
Hey!

286
00:21:41,817 --> 00:21:45,721
Road west out of town.

287
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:48,156
Thank you.

288
00:21:49,624 --> 00:21:51,525
Hercules, was that
really necessary?

289
00:21:51,525 --> 00:21:54,062
We got what we came for.
Hey, wait a minute.

290
00:21:54,062 --> 00:21:56,530
Hercules! Stop!

291
00:21:56,530 --> 00:22:00,968
What?
It's like the play we saw.

292
00:22:00,968 --> 00:22:06,008
You don't accept a gift that's been
paid for with other people's suffering.

293
00:22:07,509 --> 00:22:09,945
Serena is evil!

294
00:22:10,445 --> 00:22:12,948
And whatever
she's done to you,

295
00:22:12,948 --> 00:22:14,816
it's poisoning you.

296
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:22,239
- I had a feeling this was gonna happen.
- What do you wanna do?

297
00:22:22,239 --> 00:22:27,529
Exactly what we came here to do: Find
Xerxos and send him back where he came from.

298
00:22:27,529 --> 00:22:29,981
Till then, you're just gonna
have to put up with me.

299
00:22:36,788 --> 00:22:40,292
How much longer do we
have to lead him around?

300
00:22:40,792 --> 00:22:45,213
Until his hatred consumes him,
and he takes a life in anger.

301
00:22:45,213 --> 00:22:48,600
So many souls denied to me
by one single man.

302
00:22:50,602 --> 00:22:53,105
Today he'll pay for them
with his own.

303
00:22:56,608 --> 00:23:00,112
I made the mistake of
underestimating Hercules once.

304
00:23:00,112 --> 00:23:03,080
I'd advise you not to
make the same mistake.

305
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:07,119
I'm touched by your concern
for my well-being, Xerxos.

306
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:12,624
Let's just say I wanna make sure
you keep your end of the bargain.

307
00:23:14,626 --> 00:23:17,879
You've given me no reason
to violate our agreement.

308
00:23:17,879 --> 00:23:21,098
You'll have time to see Arciana
once Hercules is mine.

309
00:23:21,098 --> 00:23:26,638
One thing puzzles me though. Why
the sudden interest in your sister?

310
00:23:26,638 --> 00:23:29,141
That's my business.

311
00:23:31,643 --> 00:23:33,645
Very well.

312
00:23:36,148 --> 00:23:42,154
But make no mistake about it. [Voice
Deepens] Your soul belongs to me.

313
00:23:43,655 --> 00:23:46,158
It's not something
I'm likely to forget.

314
00:23:50,162 --> 00:23:52,164
Don't look so disheartened.

315
00:23:52,664 --> 00:23:55,167
You'll have Hercules to
keep you company soon enough.

316
00:23:57,669 --> 00:23:59,671
Excuse me, Hercules?

317
00:24:01,173 --> 00:24:05,677
Oh, my daughter, she's been in
bed with a cough for days now.

318
00:24:05,677 --> 00:24:08,680
It would mean so much to her
if you came by to say hello.

319
00:24:11,183 --> 00:24:13,185
Sure.

320
00:24:13,685 --> 00:24:17,189
No problem.
I'll just hold her hand...

321
00:24:17,689 --> 00:24:21,192
and tell her she can look
forward to a long life of famine,

322
00:24:21,192 --> 00:24:24,696
senseless war, incurable disease,
petty gods and hungry Hydras.

323
00:24:24,696 --> 00:24:27,664
On the plus side, if she
manages to survive all that,

324
00:24:27,664 --> 00:24:30,952
she'll enjoy the privilege
of growing old and dying anyway.

325
00:24:30,952 --> 00:24:34,171
But, hey, don't worry. I mean,
if she's been real, real good,

326
00:24:34,171 --> 00:24:36,708
she'll end up in the Elysian Fields
where she'll spend eternity...

327
00:24:36,708 --> 00:24:39,711
in a state of perpetual
boredom and ignorance.

328
00:24:40,212 --> 00:24:44,216
So please, lead the way.

329
00:24:47,219 --> 00:24:49,721
He's practicing for a play.

330
00:24:49,721 --> 00:24:52,224
Forget I said anything!

331
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:54,226
Already did.

332
00:25:03,235 --> 00:25:04,235
Hah!

333
00:25:09,241 --> 00:25:11,243
Just give us an excuse,
girlie.

334
00:25:11,743 --> 00:25:13,245
If you say so.

335
00:25:15,247 --> 00:25:16,247
Huh?

336
00:26:11,803 --> 00:26:14,806
He definitely was
a cut above.

337
00:26:14,806 --> 00:26:17,774
- Who are you?
- A fan.

338
00:26:17,774 --> 00:26:19,776
I see great potential in you,
Arciana.

339
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:22,279
I want to do what I can
to nurture your talent.

340
00:26:22,279 --> 00:26:25,317
Well, I'm not real good at paying
back favors, so don't do me any.

341
00:26:25,817 --> 00:26:29,321
Oh. But what if I told you
where the Sword of Hera was?

342
00:26:32,824 --> 00:26:34,826
I'd say start talking.

343
00:26:35,827 --> 00:26:39,796
I like you. Really, I do.

344
00:26:39,796 --> 00:26:43,335
The sword is in Hylea,
west of here.

345
00:26:45,337 --> 00:26:49,341
Like I said,
don't expect anything in return.

346
00:26:49,341 --> 00:26:53,345
Just put the sword to good use.
I'll do the rest.

347
00:26:53,345 --> 00:26:54,846
[Laughing]

348
00:26:59,851 --> 00:27:04,105
?? Grace to our father??

349
00:27:04,105 --> 00:27:08,502
?? Grace to our king??

350
00:27:08,502 --> 00:27:12,452
?? His is the glory??

351
00:27:12,452 --> 00:27:16,368
?? Wisdom shall reign??

352
00:27:16,868 --> 00:27:18,870
?? We know his truth??

353
00:27:19,371 --> 00:27:23,375
?? And his goodness??

354
00:27:23,875 --> 00:27:27,128
?? And his mercy??

355
00:27:27,128 --> 00:27:30,347
?? Is the way??

356
00:27:30,347 --> 00:27:35,387
?? And the Lord of Hosts????

357
00:27:35,387 --> 00:27:37,854
[Clapping]

358
00:27:37,854 --> 00:27:40,892
- [All Gasp]
- Music to my ears.

359
00:27:42,394 --> 00:27:45,897
You really got 'em whipped into
shape, don't you? May I help you?

360
00:27:45,897 --> 00:27:48,365
Oh, that depends.

361
00:27:48,365 --> 00:27:50,902
You remember a little girl you
took into your orphanage, oh,

362
00:27:50,902 --> 00:27:54,173
some 19 winters ago?

363
00:27:54,173 --> 00:27:57,374
Her name was Arciana.

364
00:27:57,374 --> 00:28:01,413
Indeed, I remember.
She was trouble.

365
00:28:01,413 --> 00:28:03,380
She ran away.
Ran away.

366
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:07,419
Hm. It wouldn't have
anything to do with this...

367
00:28:07,419 --> 00:28:09,886
this strap you keep
on your belt, would it?

368
00:28:09,886 --> 00:28:12,924
Sometimes discipline's the only
way to communicate with children.

369
00:28:12,924 --> 00:28:14,926
[Scattered Gasps]
[Xerxos] Really?

370
00:28:14,926 --> 00:28:17,929
[Strap Cracks]
Ah!

371
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:21,933
And I'm sure you get your point
across to them, don't you?

372
00:28:23,435 --> 00:28:26,938
- Now I'll make mine.
- [Grunting]

373
00:28:26,938 --> 00:28:28,905
Get out.

374
00:28:28,905 --> 00:28:31,443
[Scattered Gasps, Whimpers]

375
00:28:34,946 --> 00:28:39,451
Now, let me show you what it
looks like where I come from. Huh!

376
00:28:43,455 --> 00:28:45,457
Aah! Aah!

377
00:28:45,457 --> 00:28:47,459
[Screaming]

378
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:49,710
Fire!

379
00:28:51,247 --> 00:28:52,497
Fire!

380
00:28:55,967 --> 00:28:58,470
The headmaster's trapped
in the orphanage!

381
00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:00,220
Fire!

382
00:29:03,475 --> 00:29:08,980
Herc, someone's dying in there!
Herc? Herc? Hercules, come on!

383
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:12,484
- [Laughing]
- Come on!

384
00:29:17,489 --> 00:29:20,957
- [Whooping]
- Come on!

385
00:29:20,957 --> 00:29:23,995
[Man] Over here!
Hurry! Bring some water!

386
00:29:25,997 --> 00:29:27,964
Thank you.
[Coughs]

387
00:29:27,964 --> 00:29:29,966
Thank you both.
Thank you.

388
00:29:29,966 --> 00:29:32,969
You're welcome.
Xerxos went west.

389
00:29:32,969 --> 00:29:36,007
Thanks to you. I know
you didn't mean that.

390
00:29:36,007 --> 00:29:39,010
How do you know
what I mean?

391
00:29:39,511 --> 00:29:41,978
Just go.

392
00:29:41,978 --> 00:29:44,766
I'll deal with
Xerxos myself.

393
00:29:44,766 --> 00:29:47,519
I can't do that, Hercules.

394
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:51,022
Leave me alone!

395
00:29:58,530 --> 00:30:00,031
Please.

396
00:30:01,533 --> 00:30:02,283
Go.

397
00:30:13,044 --> 00:30:13,794
Oh!

398
00:30:15,046 --> 00:30:17,048
Did you see him?

399
00:30:20,051 --> 00:30:22,053
[Yells]

400
00:30:22,554 --> 00:30:26,022
Huh!
Poor Hercules.

401
00:30:26,022 --> 00:30:29,060
Did I forget to mention that the powers
I gave you have certain side effects?

402
00:30:29,561 --> 00:30:33,565
- I knew what I was getting into.
- But you thought you'd have more control, didn't you?

403
00:30:33,565 --> 00:30:38,587
Don't fight it. Lose control.
You'll feel so much better.

404
00:30:38,587 --> 00:30:43,540
- Are you enjoying yourself?
- Not yet, but I take a while.

405
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:49,080
Why are you doing this? Is it so hard
to believe that I'd be attracted to you?

406
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:53,585
Hmm, for a legendary hero, your
self-esteem is remarkably low, you know.

407
00:30:55,587 --> 00:30:57,589
You're trying
to slow me down.

408
00:30:59,090 --> 00:31:01,843
Thanks. I'll bring him back.
Come on! Come on, boy!

409
00:31:01,843 --> 00:31:04,561
Come on. Hah! Come on! Hyah!
Come on! [Horse Whinnies]

410
00:31:04,561 --> 00:31:08,600
[Hercules] Lolaus is going after
Xerxos. Come on! Yah! Come on!

411
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:11,603
Oh! Perhaps you shouldn't
have been so quick to split up.

412
00:31:12,103 --> 00:31:15,106
But then again, what choice
did you have? Damn you!

413
00:31:15,106 --> 00:31:17,609
[Giggles]
It's a little late for that.

414
00:31:17,609 --> 00:31:19,611
[Growls]

415
00:31:20,111 --> 00:31:24,616
I don't know what you think you're doing.
You're as much a threat to him as Xerxos is.

416
00:31:27,619 --> 00:31:31,122
- Uh!
- Where is the sword?

417
00:31:31,623 --> 00:31:32,623
Huh?

418
00:31:33,625 --> 00:31:35,592
I know it's here.

419
00:31:35,592 --> 00:31:40,131
If you know where it is,
you don't need us.

420
00:31:46,638 --> 00:31:49,140
Hmm. How right you are.

421
00:31:51,142 --> 00:31:51,862
Eh!
Uh!

422
00:32:07,659 --> 00:32:10,627
Time to do some real damage.

423
00:32:10,627 --> 00:32:13,665
You might wanna think twice
before you do.

424
00:32:13,665 --> 00:32:16,132
Hmm. My first victim.

425
00:32:16,132 --> 00:32:20,136
Look, I don't have time
to explain.

426
00:32:20,136 --> 00:32:22,639
Believe me when I tell you
someone is after you.

427
00:32:22,639 --> 00:32:27,178
I think I can handle a few prison guards.
But, gee, thanks for your concern.

428
00:32:27,178 --> 00:32:29,681
- I'm talking about someone a lot more dangerous.
- Oh.

429
00:32:29,681 --> 00:32:32,684
You must be talking about me.

430
00:32:32,684 --> 00:32:34,686
Thanks for caring.

431
00:32:35,687 --> 00:32:38,189
[Groaning]

432
00:32:50,702 --> 00:32:51,542
Uh! Uh!

433
00:32:54,205 --> 00:32:58,209
Okay, I'm giving you
to the count of three to let go!

434
00:32:58,209 --> 00:33:01,713
Hmm. Now here's an interesting
turn of events.

435
00:33:02,213 --> 00:33:05,216
Big brother leaves
little sister to die.

436
00:33:05,216 --> 00:33:08,184
Little sister grows up
hating him for it.

437
00:33:08,184 --> 00:33:11,723
But then, with each passing day,
she becomes more and more like him.

438
00:33:11,723 --> 00:33:12,473
No.

439
00:33:14,726 --> 00:33:17,228
But... you're dead.

440
00:33:17,228 --> 00:33:19,731
I'm beyond dead.

441
00:33:25,737 --> 00:33:28,239
- [Roaring]
- Aah! Aah!

442
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:30,742
[Men Groaning]

443
00:33:35,747 --> 00:33:37,749
Xerxos!

444
00:33:41,252 --> 00:33:44,255
- [Growls]
- [Grunts]

445
00:33:45,256 --> 00:33:48,224
Uh! Hercules, no!

446
00:33:48,224 --> 00:33:52,263
[Sword Swishes]
Get out of my way!

447
00:33:52,263 --> 00:33:56,232
No! This is exactly
what Serena wants.

448
00:33:56,232 --> 00:34:00,271
If you give into your hatred, you're
gonna lose whatever is left of you!

449
00:34:00,271 --> 00:34:01,111
Lolaus,

450
00:34:03,274 --> 00:34:06,242
if you don't move,
I will kill you.

451
00:34:06,242 --> 00:34:11,282
Then I will kill you
before I see you damn your soul.

452
00:34:22,126 --> 00:34:23,206
[Yelping]

453
00:34:25,129 --> 00:34:29,133
Hercules, I know
you're in there. Uh!

454
00:34:29,133 --> 00:34:32,136
[Groaning]

455
00:34:33,137 --> 00:34:36,140
- [Grunts]
- [Screaming]

456
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:38,142
Don't you touch me!

457
00:34:38,643 --> 00:34:40,645
It's like old times, huh?

458
00:34:40,645 --> 00:34:42,647
Let go of me!

459
00:34:44,148 --> 00:34:44,988
[Yells]

460
00:34:49,654 --> 00:34:53,157
[Growls]
You don't have to like me.

461
00:34:53,157 --> 00:34:57,161
You just have to listen.

462
00:34:57,161 --> 00:34:59,664
[Moaning]

463
00:35:04,168 --> 00:35:07,672
What are you? Something
you don't have to become.

464
00:35:08,172 --> 00:35:11,676
You still have a choice. Don't
you talk to me about choice!

465
00:35:12,176 --> 00:35:15,429
You bastard! You took
mine away a long time ago!

466
00:35:15,429 --> 00:35:18,683
- I wish I'd died that day.
- But you didn't!

467
00:35:18,683 --> 00:35:21,185
I died.
It's not in you, Arciana.

468
00:35:21,686 --> 00:35:24,188
Your heart is not black.
It's just broken.

469
00:35:24,188 --> 00:35:28,157
That's my burden to carry,
not yours.

470
00:35:28,157 --> 00:35:32,697
[Laughs] You're not actually
asking me for sympathy?

471
00:35:33,197 --> 00:35:36,701
I'm telling you...
you're looking evil in the eye.

472
00:35:37,201 --> 00:35:41,671
The only difference between us
is you can turn back.

473
00:35:41,671 --> 00:35:46,676
I don't know if you came here out
of guilt or just plain stupidity,

474
00:35:46,676 --> 00:35:51,716
but it's just a little too late to
start offering up some brotherly advice!

475
00:35:51,716 --> 00:35:55,720
Since my words don't seem to
be making an impression on you,

476
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:59,223
let me show you
something that will.

477
00:35:59,223 --> 00:36:00,223
Aah!

478
00:36:04,228 --> 00:36:06,731
[Whip Cracking]

479
00:36:13,738 --> 00:36:15,740
[Souls Wailing]

480
00:36:28,753 --> 00:36:31,721
Uhhh!
[Sobbing]

481
00:36:31,721 --> 00:36:34,724
Don't go down
the same road I did.

482
00:36:34,724 --> 00:36:38,763
- You won't like where it leads you.
- [Whimpers]

483
00:36:39,764 --> 00:36:42,732
Oh, I am so sorry...

484
00:36:42,732 --> 00:36:46,771
to break up the family reunion, Xerxos,
but it's time for you to go back home!

485
00:36:46,771 --> 00:36:52,276
I've got news for you. I'm
taking you with me. [Roars, Yells]

486
00:36:52,276 --> 00:36:54,278
[Chuckles]

487
00:37:12,296 --> 00:37:14,298
Come on! Come on!

488
00:37:15,299 --> 00:37:17,802
[Xerxos]
Going down!

489
00:37:18,803 --> 00:37:21,305
[Chuckling]

490
00:37:21,806 --> 00:37:24,308
[Hercules] Oh, this
is fun, isn't it? Wait.

491
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:26,890
Whoa-a-a!

492
00:37:43,828 --> 00:37:46,330
- Huh?
- Come here!

493
00:37:57,842 --> 00:38:00,344
- [Growls, Barks]
- [Laughing]

494
00:38:13,357 --> 00:38:14,357
Die!

495
00:38:20,364 --> 00:38:24,368
[Bones Cracking]
[Laughing]

496
00:38:26,370 --> 00:38:29,373
[Lolaus]
Come on!

497
00:38:37,381 --> 00:38:41,385
- [Roars]
- [Yells]

498
00:38:45,389 --> 00:38:47,892
[Chuckles]

499
00:38:49,393 --> 00:38:51,896
- Ooh!
- Why don't you fight me?

500
00:39:26,931 --> 00:39:29,934
[Agonized Scream]

501
00:39:39,944 --> 00:39:41,946
- Had enough?
- [Wheezes]

502
00:39:41,946 --> 00:39:43,948
Apparently not.

503
00:39:45,449 --> 00:39:47,451
Friend of yours?

504
00:39:48,452 --> 00:39:50,955
Well, let's go say hello.
Heh-heh!

505
00:40:13,978 --> 00:40:17,982
Hercules! No.

506
00:40:20,985 --> 00:40:23,487
Kill 'em! Kill them all!

507
00:40:26,991 --> 00:40:29,493
Kill them all!

508
00:40:29,493 --> 00:40:31,996
Kill them all!

509
00:40:34,999 --> 00:40:37,001
[Growls]

510
00:40:40,004 --> 00:40:42,006
[Roars]

511
00:40:47,011 --> 00:40:49,013
You'd like that,
wouldn't you?

512
00:40:51,515 --> 00:40:54,518
This is a trap. Xerxos didn't
escape. You let him out.

513
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:58,522
I'm not killing anyone.

514
00:41:00,024 --> 00:41:03,027
But you want to,
don't you?

515
00:41:04,528 --> 00:41:07,531
There's anger in your heart,
Hercules.

516
00:41:07,531 --> 00:41:10,301
One day... it'll win.

517
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:13,037
I don't think so.

518
00:41:13,537 --> 00:41:15,039
[Laughing]

519
00:41:20,544 --> 00:41:23,047
We'll meet again,
you and I.

520
00:41:25,049 --> 00:41:27,051
No, we won't.

521
00:41:28,552 --> 00:41:32,556
Well, at least
I still have you.

522
00:41:32,556 --> 00:41:34,558
[Yelling]

523
00:41:40,564 --> 00:41:44,068
I'll be watching you,
Hercules.

524
00:41:44,068 --> 00:41:45,569
[Smacks Kiss]

525
00:41:46,570 --> 00:41:47,770
[Laughing]

526
00:42:04,588 --> 00:42:07,341
Sometimes people
can surprise you.

527
00:42:07,341 --> 00:42:10,094
Sometimes we can
surprise ourselves.

528
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:19,603
You sure you're
gonna be all right?

529
00:42:20,104 --> 00:42:23,107
You're not taking me
back to prison?

530
00:42:23,107 --> 00:42:26,110
I think you've been
punished enough.

531
00:42:26,610 --> 00:42:29,113
Thank you.
Thank you both.

532
00:42:31,115 --> 00:42:33,117
Take care.

533
00:42:39,123 --> 00:42:43,127
Lolaus, I don't... [Sighs] know
what to say, other than I'm...

534
00:42:43,127 --> 00:42:46,130
sorry I threatened to
kill you. Oh, that's okay.

535
00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:48,097
I actually tried
to kill you.

536
00:42:48,097 --> 00:42:50,599
Hm! Yeah! [Chuckles]
That's right. You did.

537
00:42:50,599 --> 00:42:53,137
Huh! Man, you were so ugly
when you were possessed.

538
00:42:53,637 --> 00:42:57,141
I was? Oh, yeah. Horns and
all those things in your face.

539
00:42:57,141 --> 00:42:59,108
I mean, ugh! You don't do
possession very well.

540
00:42:59,108 --> 00:43:01,145
Hey, you didn't look too hot
when you were possessed either.

541
00:43:01,645 --> 00:43:04,148
Yeah, but I was dead.
Oh, yeah.

542
00:43:04,148 --> 00:43:06,150
Counts for a lot.
Yeah.
