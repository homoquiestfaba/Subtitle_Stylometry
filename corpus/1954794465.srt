1
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:58,650
Like a bomb exploding in reverse.

2
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:01,410
Thoughts, ideas...

3
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:03,610
fragments of images.

4
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:06,900
Shards of memory, like shrapnel,

5
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:09,620
all come back to me,

6
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:14,210
and are forced back out
in a cruel pastiche of experience.

7
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:31,260
Shit.

8
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:19,270
And who might you be?

9
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,570
You're not much of a burglar, are you?

10
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,070
Take your clothes off.

11
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:37,280
Come to bed
and you can have whatever you want.

12
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:23,870
You actually make money out of painting?

13
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,830
Mm.

14
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:30,960
It's not something I've ever
really thought about.

15
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:33,420
There were some pictures at my mum's

16
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:36,930
but they weren't really for looking at,
they were just...

17
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,970
Just sort of there.

18
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:42,180
Oh, yes.

19
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:44,890
That's interesting, George.

20
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:48,140
But nothing like yours, obviously.

21
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,310
Obviously.

22
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:12,670
I've done a few jobs
but I'm not much of a crook, really.

23
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,670
I've spent more time inside than out.

24
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:18,460
He is all of them compressed into one man.

25
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,590
I love what closes him out.

26
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:26,180
Not quite the Nietzsche of the football team
but still...

27
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,020
I know, dear,
but worse things happen at Hiroshima.

28
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:36,610
Now, which lovely member's
going to buy Mother a drink?

29
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:38,200
I'll get these.

30
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,360
Deakin, what'll you have?

31
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:42,780
I need a big one to calm me down.

32
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,830
Then I'll tell all.

33
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:48,370
So what's new? He needs a big one!

34
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,790
The sphincter without a secret's
come over all queer.

35
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:55,590
Give her a fag and pull up a pouffe
for her to sit on.

36
00:07:55,890 --> 00:07:57,590
What's got your knickers in a twist, then?

37
00:07:57,890 --> 00:08:02,180
It's her ladyship.
I think she might be going steady.

38
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:05,010
What are you talking about?
Do I know this woman?

39
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:08,180
You most certainly do. Miss Bacon herself.

40
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:12,610
The tom-tom drums have started already,
have they? That's quick.

41
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,480
The lady has got a new tart.

42
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:20,030
I don't like talking about Francis's
private life. I need to get some air.

43
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:25,910
So, this big brute drops out of the sky
and into her bed.

44
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:28,200
I find that rather suspect.

45
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,370
The cottage at Piccadilly, more likely.

46
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:33,540
You want to watch your vile, poisoned tongue,
missy.

47
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:36,210
You've got your nose jammed so far
up Francis's arse,

48
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:39,550
you're not going to notice the axe
hanging over your head.

49
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:42,390
Thank you, Muriel, darling,
I value your dishonesty.

50
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:45,020
Perhaps you could steal
this one off him, Dan,

51
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:47,140
as a sort of revenge thing.

52
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,270
Or have him on your telly programme.

53
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:51,480
'The Twilight World of Unhappy Poofs.'

54
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:54,230
How do you know they're unhappy?
They've only just met.

55
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:57,240
If they're getting on, then they're unhappy.

56
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:59,690
That's what love means.

57
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:12,370
That kid the Krays are pumping,

58
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:15,250
he really hasn't got a decent left hook.

59
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,130
I can't see him going more than four rounds.

60
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:25,890
Yeah, but I think Ronnie's pumping him
quite a different way.

61
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,150
I met this bloke.

62
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,270
- What, a fighter?
- No, a painter.

63
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:37,310
I need someone to do my lounge.

64
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:39,530
Not that sort of painter.

65
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:43,030
- He does paintings.
- That's no bloody use, is it?

66
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:08,390
Arghh!

67
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:25,530
Our time together has given me a whole new...

68
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:27,860
energy.

69
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:31,790
Not just for the work,
but moments like these.

70
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,990
You may well become a subject.

71
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:39,120
For a painting.

72
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:42,910
That'd be fantastic.
I always wanted a picture of me.

73
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:45,050
To me, you're like a sorbet.

74
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:47,550
You cleanse the palate between courses.

75
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:51,010
Sometimes, of course, it's a little bitter.

76
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:53,180
What?

77
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,970
It doesn't matter.

78
00:12:55,770 --> 00:12:57,600
Come along. We have an appointment.

79
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:00,140
It's time for the emperor's real clothes.

80
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:09,740
A man being measured for a suit

81
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:12,780
is not dissimilar to his being measured for
the old wooden box.

82
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,820
Feels like a bloody coffin.
It's fucking hot in here, Francis.

83
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:18,040
Yes, it is hot, George.

84
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,340
Mr Dyer will arrange to collect the suit.

85
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:26,090
I think we're going to have some shirts
and some appropriate ties.

86
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:28,840
Hold on, hold on, don't go overboard.
I feel so...

87
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:30,670
So clothed?

88
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:33,890
You just don't care
what people think, do you?

89
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:37,270
I want you to meet my friends.
We can have a drink. God knows, I need one.

90
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:40,930
- Your mates?
- The Colony is a refuge for lost souls...

91
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:43,390
no longer in possession of living bodies.

92
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:45,280
Can't we just go to the pub?

93
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:47,230
No.

94
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:51,570
Oh, come off it, you fell in love
with yourself. Love at first sight.

95
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:54,530
And you're the only one
you're fucking faithful to.

96
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:56,620
I drink for the thirst to come.

97
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:58,950
Mm. And everyone else's.

98
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:01,910
I never see you getting out your bead bag,
Lottie.

99
00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:05,420
- I don't think you know me at all, Muriel.
- No, I don't give a fuck, dear.

100
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,080
Twat.

101
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:09,170
You're an arty little shit, Deakin.

102
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:13,050
You're a waste of space and you bore me.
Why don't you go and ponce somewhere else?

103
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:15,090
Miss Hitler was more generous than you.

104
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:16,600
Anyway, do go on, Isabel.

105
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:20,310
So, anyway,
Margaret stepped up to the microphone

106
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:22,940
and started singing I Get a Kick.

107
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:29,440
The whole ballroom was reverently pretending
to be entertained when...

108
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:35,610
from the back of the room came a series
of loud and vigorous boos and hisses.

109
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:38,450
No, no, not my naughty daughter, was it?
Was it?

110
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:40,460
No!

111
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:44,500
Total impatience with ineptitude of any kind.

112
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:49,880
And the poor little midget seemed to shrink
even more as she ran from the stage sobbing.

113
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:53,090
Francis, of course, thought it the only
reasonable way to respond.

114
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:55,130
Naturally!

115
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:58,180
Oh, here's my daughter now.

116
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,849
Bravo.

117
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:02,220
Everybody, this is George.

118
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,510
This is Muriel, Isabel,

119
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,400
the beautiful Henrietta,

120
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:09,149
and Deakin.

121
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:11,690
Introduce yourselves. George is a little shy.

122
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:13,659
Hello.

123
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:16,530
So...who's Arthur and who's Martha?

124
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:19,820
Oh, piss off, Deakin! I'm really sick of it!

125
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,580
I'll talk to you after you've had a shave.

126
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:27,170
Welcome to the concentration of camp.

127
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:29,000
Why are you so down on Deakin?

128
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:33,090
I'm sick of that tight-fisted little ponce,
scrounging on all my lovely members,

129
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:34,750
putting everybody off coming in.

130
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:36,800
People have been complaining.

131
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,890
- We wouldn't want to give your chum...
- George.

132
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:43,180
..your charming chum George
the wrong impression, would we?

133
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,899
Cheerio.

134
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:46,810
Cheerio!

135
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:03,660
Smells good.

136
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:07,170
Does it?

137
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:09,170
Yeah.

138
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:11,300
Nice and simple.

139
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:14,460
Not like that muck with all those sauces
you took me to last week.

140
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:20,600
- It's Boulestin, George.
- Yeah, but it's all so poncy, isn't it?

141
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:25,850
I mean, all that cutlery.
You only need one knife and one fork.

142
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:27,980
And those fucking waiters...

143
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:30,270
Hanging around like bloody vultures.

144
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,320
I love it when it's just me and you.

145
00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:41,410
So do I, George.

146
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,240
So do I.

147
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:51,000
Well, he took us for dinner,
which was fantastic,

148
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:54,380
but then he refused to pay for our taxi home.

149
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,130
I had to walk the whole bloody way.

150
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:03,300
Can you believe that anybody who is so rich
can be so fucking mean?

151
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:06,010
But then he said he wanted to paint me

152
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:08,220
and I was thrilled.

153
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:14,940
OK?

154
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,320
So, what are we doing?

155
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:19,860
Is this what you usually get up to for Vogue?

156
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:26,580
If I photographed their string beans
naked I'd get done by Obscene
Publications. God, no.

157
00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:29,870
These are sort of er...technical.

158
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:33,960
How should Francis know
what a fanny looked like?

159
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:36,170
- True.
- Ooh.

160
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,750
That ought to knock 'em dead.

161
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:44,970
Push your tits to either side.

162
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:47,840
That's it. And lay them in the aisles.

163
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:53,350
- Is that right?
- Oh, yes. Yes!

164
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:59,810
Move your right leg more over this way.

165
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,730
OK.

166
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:06,320
Yes, yes, yes.

167
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,910
That ought to slaughter them.

168
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:14,620
Stick both legs in the air
and point your toes just like Nijinsky.

169
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,830
- Really?
- Yes. Good.

170
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:21,760
I think you're taking Francis
too literally, Deakin.

171
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:23,970
I don't want the camera inside me.

172
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:26,850
A bottom shot, lovely.

173
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:30,470
Oh! Piss off!

174
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:35,180
- I'm rather looking forward to this.
- Yeah, I like a good fight.

175
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:38,520
Boxing is such a marvellous aperitif to sex.

176
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:40,440
I don't know how you work that one out.

177
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:44,230
Bullfighting does it too.
It unlocks the valves of feeling.

178
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,240
I've never been to Spain.

179
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:50,700
Do I detect a hint, George?

180
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:58,250
- Hello.
- Good to see you, George.

181
00:18:58,550 --> 00:19:01,260
Hello, George. Haven't seen you about.
What've you been up to?

182
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:04,640
- I'm working for Mr Bacon here.
- That's all right, then, innit?

183
00:19:04,930 --> 00:19:09,300
- Don't see you down the Turkish these days.
- We tend to go up West, Soho and that.

184
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,220
- We do, do we? We tend.
- Yeah.

185
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,230
Yeah, us too of a weekend.

186
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,440
Francis! George!

187
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,690
And who are your charming friends?

188
00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:30,330
Henrietta, this is Ken Bidwell, Joe Furneval.

189
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:35,830
Do let's get together for a drink
after the fighting.

190
00:19:36,130 --> 00:19:38,040
- I don't think so, love.
- Aw!

191
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:43,220
George, you should come down the club.
We've really pulled it together.

192
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:45,220
And don't bring the freak show.

193
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:47,350
I'll see you soon enough.

194
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,300
Francis keeps me pretty busy.

195
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,689
Yeah?

196
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:53,430
Listen, George,
you want to watch those poncy types.

197
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:56,850
A right old tart, isn't she?
You stick with your own kind, mate.

198
00:19:57,150 --> 00:19:59,440
- He pay you all right?
- It's the life of Riley.

199
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:02,480
We booze it up,
play the tables down Charlie Chester's.

200
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:05,150
They look like a right bunch
of wankers to me.

201
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:06,940
You take care, George.

202
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:11,530
They'll drop you like a ton of shit when
they've finished with you, you mark my words.

203
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:13,740
I push the buttons.

204
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:48,900
Use your right, use your right!

205
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,190
Killer! Get him down!

206
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:10,470
The only trade was in the ring.

207
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:13,800
Francis was in his usual state of grace
in the face of violence.

208
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:17,470
And Mr Dyer on the right hand of the Father
as usual? Of course.

209
00:21:17,770 --> 00:21:19,810
Trailing behind like a sick puppy.

210
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:24,270
He quite brightened up when some demi-Krays
came sniffing round Henrietta.

211
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:30,740
God, it was so sad, those shabby little men
with their sad little women.

212
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,950
Pond life, darling.

213
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:36,160
Dear George.

214
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:38,570
- Does anyone like her?
- Thick as shit.

215
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:41,500
And half as interesting.

216
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,330
- She's hung like a horse, dear.
- Not like you, then.

217
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:47,920
It's the '60s, darling.
You're living under bloody rationing.

218
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:52,260
Let's have a bottle of your
disgusting giggle, madame.

219
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,300
Darling, of course.

220
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:58,510
George is pond life, darling, I just know it.
You can smell it a mile off.

221
00:21:58,810 --> 00:22:00,680
George has qualities.

222
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:05,270
A combination of amorality and innocence.

223
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:10,570
And note that I say innocence
and not ignorance.

224
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:13,070
Oh, no! Fantastic!

225
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,290
Champagne for my real friends.

226
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:18,990
Real pain for my sham friends.

227
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:22,040
You see, George has an innocence,

228
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:24,950
which I couldn't possibly expect
any of you to recognise

229
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:28,470
even if it was jammed up
your arse on his fist.

230
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:34,430
I'm sure that's exactly
how you came across it.

231
00:22:35,770 --> 00:22:37,550
Cheers.

232
00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:43,760
When I went into the house of pleasure,

233
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:49,350
I didn't stay in the room where they
celebrate acceptable modes of loving

234
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:51,570
in the bourgeois style.

235
00:22:52,490 --> 00:22:55,330
I went into the rooms which are kept secret

236
00:22:56,330 --> 00:22:58,320
and I leaned and lay on their beds.

237
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:02,420
I went into the rooms which are kept secret

238
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:05,170
which they consider it shameful even to name.

239
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,880
But there is no such shame for me

240
00:23:08,630 --> 00:23:13,970
because then, what sort of poet,
and what sort of artist would I be?

241
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,990
Sorry.

242
00:25:53,630 --> 00:25:58,380
Submitting entirely to the service
and pleasure of a dominant partner

243
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,590
is, I find, a catharsis,

244
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:03,880
in that all responsibility is relinquished,

245
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:06,930
every move is dictated.

246
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:09,940
No decisions are your own.

247
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:15,100
You exist solely for the service and pleasure
of another man.

248
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:24,110
They weren't satisfied with just one, either.

249
00:26:24,410 --> 00:26:25,990
No, they were there all night.

250
00:26:26,290 --> 00:26:28,000
They did it three times each.

251
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:32,120
Plus, after the first go,
they removed the gag

252
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:34,960
and replaced it with what
I'm told is a piss gag.

253
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,300
So we had to drink piss, too.

254
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:41,300
There you are, you see.
The Germans were very advanced in the '30s.

255
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:45,760
I really can't say that I can see
the pleasure in drinking piss.

256
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:54,770
Although, I gather that certain actresses
drink gallons of it for their skin.

257
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:56,730
Eurgh.

258
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:00,490
Much better to just take the piss, dear.

259
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,530
À la Deakin.

260
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:04,780
What is Princess Tiny Meat up to now?

261
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:08,290
I don't know. He's probably still trying
to sell those photographs

262
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:11,240
to any Soho pervert
with five shillings to spare.

263
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:14,380
They're totally the wrong angles.

264
00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:16,910
Far more Penthouse than Portrait.

265
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:19,380
Beef curtains and everything.

266
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:22,040
It's as if he's trying to shove the camera
up her arse.

267
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:24,260
I'm a stickler for convention.

268
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:28,180
Carpet-munching and nothing else.

269
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,760
My lovely girl looks after me.

270
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:32,890
She's the bees knees.

271
00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:35,810
Mother, please. You're sabotaging my seafood.

272
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:48,280
Some seem to think my work is drawn from
an expression of horror,

273
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,200
which has never really concerned me.

274
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:54,170
Pleasure is impossible to define.

275
00:27:55,210 --> 00:27:58,170
And I feel horror occupies
much the same territory.

276
00:28:00,010 --> 00:28:03,090
But, you see, I'm optimistic by nature.

277
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:07,180
I'm optimistic about nothing.

278
00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:15,520
You know, the fascinating thing
about early cinema is that,

279
00:28:15,810 --> 00:28:18,310
apart from the actual patina of time,

280
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:23,190
there's the exquisite knowledge
that you're communing with the dead.

281
00:28:23,490 --> 00:28:27,610
Like everyone living today, these people
flickering up there on the screen

282
00:28:27,910 --> 00:28:29,870
could never envisage their own death.

283
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:32,830
Everyone always imagines
they'll live for ever.

284
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:36,740
It's always the next man
who will certainly die.

285
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:39,130
Francis, please, I'm trying to concentrate.

286
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:55,510
- It's not The Sound of Music.
- Ssh, Hen.

287
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:10,740
Francis, stop it.

288
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:14,450
I'm Daniel Farson.

289
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:17,620
Tonight on Hungry Eye,
it gives me great pleasure to welcome

290
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:20,660
Britain's greatest living painter,
Francis Bacon.

291
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:24,300
Good evening.

292
00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:27,130
Francis Bacon,
your work is known internationally

293
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:31,220
as some of the most challenging and powerful
of the post-war years.

294
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:36,230
You've resisted the Abstract movements,
which have dominated those years,

295
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:39,810
and have championed the importance
of the figure in modern art.

296
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:43,600
Why is the figure so important to you?

297
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:49,480
Er... well, it's difficult
to describe, really.

298
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:52,780
- One can only talk about one's instincts...
- Hm?

299
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:54,820
..and avoid the rest.

300
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:57,910
I do it with a chance brush stroke

301
00:29:58,210 --> 00:30:00,040
which locks the magic in place.

302
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:02,120
It's a fortuitous thing.

303
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:04,960
It's not something I can
predict or orchestrate.

304
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:07,670
The work carries the mark of life,

305
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:15,050
rather like a man whose flesh
retains the scars of an accident.

306
00:30:15,890 --> 00:30:18,930
I suppose there are scars on the psyche too.

307
00:31:50,650 --> 00:31:52,650
I was in a cold sweat.

308
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:55,690
I ran so bloody fast, I tell you.

309
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:02,200
Oh, not another cigarette.

310
00:32:04,290 --> 00:32:06,280
George, we all have nightmares.

311
00:32:07,130 --> 00:32:09,370
They can't be as horrific as life.

312
00:32:10,090 --> 00:32:12,130
I'm having these dreams more and more.

313
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:15,970
And, you know, it feels like a...like a...

314
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:18,430
- Like a premonition.
- Premonition.

315
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:22,010
An omen of things to come.

316
00:32:25,690 --> 00:32:27,680
I bloody hope not.

317
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:38,570
I watch him while he's sleeping.

318
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:42,110
A prisoner of dreams.

319
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:46,540
Fighting the battle
he's always going to lose.

320
00:32:48,090 --> 00:32:50,080
But I'm powerless to help him,

321
00:32:51,090 --> 00:32:53,080
as I'm powerless to help myself.

322
00:32:54,510 --> 00:32:56,500
So I watch.

323
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:59,050
And wait.

324
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:29,600
Now...

325
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:32,350
out into the gymnasium of the city...

326
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:37,480
..to cast my rod into the sewer...

327
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:44,230
..and see what comes up this time.

328
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:51,330
- Good evening, Mr B.
- Ah, good evening.

329
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:54,240
That's all right.

330
00:34:54,590 --> 00:34:56,450
Nice to see you back so soon, sir.

331
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,500
Have we met before?

332
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:02,540
Not exactly, sir. I helped your friend
out of the building the other night.

333
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:04,430
- My...
- You were busy at the tables.

334
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,510
Oh, yes. George, Mr Dyer.

335
00:35:06,810 --> 00:35:08,720
Oh, yes, I remember.

336
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:12,180
Yes, I remember.
Well, it's good to see you again.

337
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:15,600
Why not pop in for a drink
when you're finished up here? Hm?

338
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:17,310
As my guest?

339
00:35:17,610 --> 00:35:19,350
I don't mind if I do, sir.

340
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:22,940
- I'll have a word with the boss.
- Yes, you do that. So will I.

341
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:31,740
That's all, thank you. No more bets.

342
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:26,090
This painful inability
to sustain relationships.

343
00:36:26,930 --> 00:36:30,890
The selfishness my work demands
leaves no room for an emotional self.

344
00:36:31,850 --> 00:36:36,060
Can tenderness ultimately only manifest
itself in the motion of a brush?

345
00:36:37,110 --> 00:36:39,100
Even this remains invisible.

346
00:36:40,650 --> 00:36:42,310
The visceral reach,

347
00:36:42,610 --> 00:36:46,110
running fingertips along the curved notches
of a spine.

348
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:51,120
The line of a femur,
the curl of tendon into muscle.

349
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:54,120
The smell.

350
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:56,450
To violate, desecrate,

351
00:36:56,750 --> 00:36:58,660
to examine a person from the inside,

352
00:36:59,590 --> 00:37:03,920
eroticising the white shirt cuff
glimpsed beneath a dark suit.

353
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:08,430
The girth, the solids, the sack of flesh,

354
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:11,050
just offal bags.

355
00:37:11,350 --> 00:37:13,140
Ruminating intestines.

356
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:17,150
Fine wines filled and swilled with rich food,

357
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:23,650
trying to create some distance
between myself and some dead lover.

358
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:54,310
If I was going to do it,
I'd use one of those pill things

359
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,060
the Germans used.

360
00:37:56,350 --> 00:38:01,020
One... one crunch and two minutes of agony
and that's it, you've gone.

361
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:05,860
But I prefer to explore other people.

362
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:09,570
That interests me far more
than my own misery.

363
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:14,330
I'd love to get my fingers inside them

364
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:17,530
and just have a good old feel about, you see.

365
00:38:17,830 --> 00:38:21,950
But you can't break down
the barrier of the skin.

366
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,210
You are a cup of tea, Daughter.

367
00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:29,720
Mr and Mrs Martyr went to the lions together.

368
00:38:30,010 --> 00:38:31,590
Here she goes again, dear.

369
00:38:31,890 --> 00:38:33,800
They were eaten alone.

370
00:38:34,890 --> 00:38:38,310
- 'We who are about to die salute you.'
- Oh, shut up, Deakin.

371
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:40,890
Yes, and none too soon, either.

372
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:45,560
What I'm trying to say is,
I can't do it for other people.

373
00:38:46,610 --> 00:38:48,570
I can only do it to excite myself.

374
00:38:49,530 --> 00:38:53,490
It's always torture with you
when it comes to exciting yourself.

375
00:38:53,790 --> 00:38:55,490
Or some kind of abuse, eh, George?

376
00:38:55,790 --> 00:38:57,570
Well...

377
00:38:58,290 --> 00:39:02,750
We're all in our own private personal prison.

378
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,080
Hear, hear!

379
00:39:04,090 --> 00:39:05,870
And you never see the blood...

380
00:39:06,170 --> 00:39:09,760
Until your throat is cut!

381
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,380
So you're showing the feelings?

382
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:16,510
Feelings?

383
00:39:16,770 --> 00:39:18,130
Feelings!

384
00:39:18,430 --> 00:39:20,550
I prefer to show two men fucking.

385
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,060
That's the fact of it.

386
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:27,940
Cut out all the talk and go straight -
if you'll pardon the expression -

387
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:30,400
to the action.

388
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,270
This is just a trophy.

389
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:36,730
- Cheerio.
- Cheerio.

390
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,900
There's a fleeting substance to reality.

391
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:32,350
Ghostlike deposits.

392
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:38,440
Sometimes, a man's shadow
is more in the room than he is.

393
00:41:39,490 --> 00:41:42,530
The void which spreads across his face
as he daydreams

394
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:47,040
is the void of death.

395
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:10,430
Place your bets.

396
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:23,150
That's all. No more bets.

397
00:43:11,330 --> 00:43:13,330
That's all. No more bets.

398
00:43:42,950 --> 00:43:44,940
So you like it like this?

399
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:47,990
Why didn't you say?

400
00:43:48,290 --> 00:43:51,120
I've seen some old Tory bastard
who's well into it.

401
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:54,030
Have you, now?

402
00:44:11,850 --> 00:44:13,850
Francis!

403
00:44:19,190 --> 00:44:21,780
Francis, open the door!

404
00:44:31,410 --> 00:44:33,410
Francis, open the door, please.

405
00:44:34,210 --> 00:44:37,250
Please open the door, Fra...

406
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:48,090
Francis!

407
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:15,990
It's not a funeral. Can we force
a smile, please? Lovely.

408
00:45:16,290 --> 00:45:20,000
You knew it was me but you let me stand there
in the pouring fucking rain.

409
00:45:21,010 --> 00:45:23,340
We've missed you, George.
What have you been up to?

410
00:45:23,630 --> 00:45:26,130
Still posing...as a sodomite?

411
00:45:26,430 --> 00:45:29,140
Don't start on me, Deakin.
I'm really not in the mood.

412
00:45:29,850 --> 00:45:32,840
You have no idea
what goes on with me and Francis.

413
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:36,640
You're the fucking ponce, not me.

414
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:40,810
At least I don't try to make a career
out of someone else's life.

415
00:45:41,110 --> 00:45:42,720
No good deed goes unpunished.

416
00:45:43,030 --> 00:45:45,490
Oh, what are you on, you silly old cow?

417
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:47,520
Glamour shot. Happy happy, now.

418
00:45:47,820 --> 00:45:51,360
Oh, get out of the way, buggers!
We'll have to do it again.

419
00:45:52,620 --> 00:45:54,700
Well, there's someone worth letting in.

420
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,910
In more ways than one.

421
00:46:08,430 --> 00:46:10,130
No...

422
00:46:22,940 --> 00:46:24,070
No!

423
00:46:25,490 --> 00:46:27,480
What's the matter?

424
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:32,860
Oh, God, you're a fucking pain
even when you're asleep.

425
00:47:21,170 --> 00:47:22,629
Agh!

426
00:47:22,630 --> 00:47:24,540
Must you make so much noise?

427
00:47:29,630 --> 00:47:30,920
I'm going to die.

428
00:47:31,220 --> 00:47:33,130
I'll arrange a hearse.

429
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:46,970
- What are you having?
- Cheap and cheerful.

430
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:50,270
Francis! Francis.

431
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:55,610
How wonderful you're here.
I was just talking about you to Volker.

432
00:47:55,910 --> 00:47:57,820
He is such a fantastic painter.

433
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:01,710
Volker Dix, Francis Bacon.

434
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:05,460
Mr Bacon, it's such an honour to meet you.
Your paintings have changed my life.

435
00:48:05,750 --> 00:48:08,790
- Truly?
- Your paintings have shown me the way.

436
00:48:09,090 --> 00:48:11,420
It says: Painting is self-expression.

437
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:14,180
Oh! I wouldn't want to do that!

438
00:48:15,890 --> 00:48:18,850
In fact, my paintings are quite spiritual
and meditative,

439
00:48:19,140 --> 00:48:20,760
and abstract, naturally.

440
00:48:21,060 --> 00:48:22,269
Oh, naturally.

441
00:48:22,270 --> 00:48:26,260
I wonder if you'd do me the honour
of visiting my studio. I'd so value
your opinion.

442
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:29,060
Well, I don't have to see your pictures.

443
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:33,320
I can tell by your taste in neckties
that you have absolutely no talent at all.

444
00:48:33,610 --> 00:48:36,280
- Champagne.
- He doesn't mean it, darling.

445
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:40,110
Where the hell is George?

446
00:48:42,370 --> 00:48:43,660
He's here.

447
00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:46,030
George, what on earth's happened?

448
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:49,370
Oh, no, he looks pretty as a picture.

449
00:48:49,670 --> 00:48:52,210
It was that blond slag
from Charlie Chester's.

450
00:48:53,050 --> 00:48:55,880
Him and a couple of little bastards
were ragging on me.

451
00:48:56,760 --> 00:48:58,470
I had a few words, that's all.

452
00:48:58,760 --> 00:49:01,300
We all know what a way you have with words,
George.

453
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:04,760
What did you write on the poor angel's face,
dear? Poetry?

454
00:49:17,490 --> 00:49:20,230
What's the bloody use
if you can't even get it up?

455
00:49:20,540 --> 00:49:24,120
- I don't fucking want to!
- Come on, George, you can do
better than that.

456
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:26,160
Francis, you're a fucking bastard.

457
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:28,370
You'd better go, George.

458
00:49:58,820 --> 00:50:04,660
Social success
and domestic happiness can be expected.

459
00:50:09,790 --> 00:50:15,290
- Bright spells, some rain at times.
- Similar.

460
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:21,710
Another one of those bombs went off.

461
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:23,800
Shopping centre.

462
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:27,090
Hundreds of kiddies blown to bits.

463
00:50:27,390 --> 00:50:29,730
George, will you please shut up?

464
00:50:31,190 --> 00:50:34,350
It's bad enough you sitting there
rustling that paper.

465
00:50:39,820 --> 00:50:41,820
All right.

466
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,990
I'm off.

467
00:50:53,130 --> 00:50:55,040
I've got things to do.

468
00:50:55,840 --> 00:50:57,380
I've got people to see.

469
00:50:57,680 --> 00:50:59,510
And people who want to see me.

470
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:02,760
Yeah, I did have a life
before I met you, Francis.

471
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:05,550
You know? Wide circle of friends.

472
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:18,460
Once a stone's been polished,
you can't return it to the rough.

473
00:52:19,670 --> 00:52:22,210
A flower that's been picked
has only one fate.

474
00:52:23,220 --> 00:52:26,800
That's why whores consider it bad luck
to receive cut flowers.

475
00:52:28,180 --> 00:52:30,890
They know that they are going to die.

476
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:43,900
Oh, do stop staring at Mr Knife and Mrs Fork,
George!

477
00:52:44,870 --> 00:52:48,860
From the expression on your eek,
anyone'd think they'd been covered in poison.

478
00:52:49,160 --> 00:52:50,990
Try to relax.

479
00:52:51,290 --> 00:52:53,080
Give her another drink.

480
00:52:54,540 --> 00:52:58,210
Everywhere she looks,
she sees potential tools of destruction.

481
00:52:59,050 --> 00:53:02,920
Mm. The cutlery drawer at home
is a riot of possibility.

482
00:53:04,010 --> 00:53:07,380
The beam in the studio
is screaming to have a noose thrown over it.

483
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:10,970
And the poor, innocent bath
can't wait to be filled with hot water, gin,

484
00:53:11,270 --> 00:53:12,850
and bleeding wrists.

485
00:53:13,140 --> 00:53:15,810
The whole world's in a conspiracy
against her.

486
00:53:16,110 --> 00:53:18,020
We won't even mention the chemist.

487
00:53:18,860 --> 00:53:23,600
Every inanimate object wants to help
poor Miss Thing here with her susan-side.

488
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:27,020
- Don't they, George?
- Go on, laugh.

489
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:31,690
I was reading a thing with Hockney the other
day and he was talking about you, Francis.

490
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:35,710
He said the thing he really loved about
your paintings was he could smell the balls.

491
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,160
Typical.

492
00:53:37,170 --> 00:53:41,960
They say you're pure horror.
'The morbid poet of the world of evil.'

493
00:53:42,260 --> 00:53:45,120
Great artist/great art. Evil and vicious.

494
00:53:45,430 --> 00:53:46,840
Or not.

495
00:53:47,140 --> 00:53:50,100
Do you think it's possible
for a poof to be a great artist?

496
00:53:50,390 --> 00:53:53,430
Let's not be so tiresome
as to run down the list.

497
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:57,840
But you are a great artist,
everybody knows that. Everybody says so.

498
00:53:58,150 --> 00:54:00,760
Thank you for your expert appraisal, George.

499
00:54:01,070 --> 00:54:02,980
Eat your heart out, Anthony Blunt.

500
00:54:09,660 --> 00:54:14,530
What mad misfortunes
make his eyes blaze with despair?

501
00:54:16,710 --> 00:54:19,670
I dream of some tough lover.

502
00:54:20,670 --> 00:54:22,660
Big as the universe,

503
00:54:23,710 --> 00:54:27,050
his body blemished by shadows.

504
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:31,300
He'll crush me, naked,

505
00:54:32,390 --> 00:54:36,100
in gloomy bars between his golden thighs.

506
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:42,190
A mundane yob transformed into an archangel.

507
00:54:44,490 --> 00:54:47,230
Is my lover to be my assassin?

508
00:54:48,570 --> 00:54:50,560
Or I his?

509
00:54:52,870 --> 00:54:54,860
Loneliness -

510
00:54:55,830 --> 00:54:59,320
my only true companion -
will always rival any lover.

511
00:55:01,250 --> 00:55:03,160
Its greedy desire...

512
00:55:04,630 --> 00:55:09,170
..always drive a wedge between me
and any contender for my company.

513
00:55:11,470 --> 00:55:13,460
And I question myself.

514
00:55:15,970 --> 00:55:19,310
Do I possess some inner destructive demon?

515
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:33,200
Yes, I've decided to take George with me
to New York.

516
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:40,280
Yes, he has several new suits.
He looks quite convincing.

517
00:55:40,580 --> 00:55:42,700
I shall have my own personal bodyguard.

518
00:55:48,090 --> 00:55:50,300
Of course, darling. That's what I want.

519
00:55:55,510 --> 00:55:58,010
Yes, but he's been really rather good lately.

520
00:56:04,270 --> 00:56:07,560
Come on, Isabel, we all like a drink.

521
00:56:09,990 --> 00:56:12,100
Of course I'll keep a watch out for him.

522
00:56:13,240 --> 00:56:17,200
No! I would never do that. Really, Isabel!

523
00:56:18,250 --> 00:56:21,580
I sometimes wonder what sort of a person
you think I am. Hm?

524
00:56:22,290 --> 00:56:26,160
Oh, yes, I know, yes. I'm a stupid idi-ot.

525
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:29,210
Yes.

526
00:56:29,510 --> 00:56:31,009
Yes. Goodbye.

527
00:56:31,010 --> 00:56:32,920
What? Yes.

528
00:58:43,560 --> 00:58:45,420
When I die,

529
00:58:45,730 --> 00:58:50,270
they're going to open me up and they're going
to find 'Loser' tattooed on my heart.

530
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:02,570
Fuck off, George.

531
00:59:33,070 --> 00:59:34,730
Mr Francis Bacon?

532
00:59:35,030 --> 00:59:36,279
Yes.

533
00:59:36,280 --> 00:59:38,730
Mr Francis Bacon,
I have a warrant to search your abode.

534
00:59:39,030 --> 00:59:43,490
We have reason to believe you're
in possession of controlled
or illegal substances.

535
00:59:44,330 --> 00:59:47,290
Oh, well, then you'd better come inside,
gentlemen.

536
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:53,450
Do you mind if I call my solicitor?

537
00:59:57,010 --> 00:59:58,750
Hello. Geoffrey?

538
00:59:59,550 --> 01:00:01,340
Um...well...

539
01:00:02,180 --> 01:00:04,670
I've got some of our boys
in blue with me here.

540
01:00:05,850 --> 01:00:07,800
Yes, that's right.

541
01:00:11,230 --> 01:00:13,140
Yes, all right, Geoffrey.

542
01:00:13,770 --> 01:00:17,690
Yes, well, I think George
has been telling tales.

543
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:21,610
Yes, of course. That would be marvellous.

544
01:00:23,450 --> 01:00:25,240
I'll put him on.

545
01:00:25,530 --> 01:00:27,570
Got something here, sarge.

546
01:00:27,870 --> 01:00:29,780
Sergeant, would you?

547
01:00:35,170 --> 01:00:39,880
It would seem that the situation is somewhat
different since you spoke to Mr Bacon.

548
01:00:40,590 --> 01:00:42,800
Yes, sir, I'll see you down at the station.

549
01:00:44,180 --> 01:00:45,840
Right...

550
01:00:46,140 --> 01:00:49,600
Well, then, Mr Bacon,
we'd best be getting down to the station.

551
01:00:49,890 --> 01:00:52,980
Will this take very long?
I do have some appointments today.

552
01:00:53,270 --> 01:00:55,640
You'll have to be fingerprinted and charged.

553
01:00:55,940 --> 01:00:57,520
It's mere formality.

554
01:00:57,820 --> 01:01:02,190
I think I can already tell you
who most probably placed that substance here.

555
01:01:02,490 --> 01:01:06,400
It's more than likely the same person
who suggested that you pay me a visit.

556
01:01:07,700 --> 01:01:12,620
A rather disturbed gentleman
who works for me as an odd-job man.

557
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:15,280
We'll let the court decide that, sir.

558
01:01:15,580 --> 01:01:17,750
The court? Oh!

559
01:01:18,040 --> 01:01:19,960
Oh, how exciting.

560
01:01:21,130 --> 01:01:24,720
Well, officer, if one of your men
would like to lead the way.

561
01:01:26,260 --> 01:01:28,050
Would you like to handcuff me?

562
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:47,820
Hello? Dr Banway? Hello.
Yeah, yeah. It's George.

563
01:01:48,410 --> 01:01:50,400
Look, I need some more...

564
01:01:53,710 --> 01:01:56,040
I've stopped doing the heroin injections.

565
01:01:56,830 --> 01:01:59,200
These things just keep me on an even keel.

566
01:02:01,880 --> 01:02:04,500
It's just such a fucking wind-up!

567
01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:06,540
The people I'm running with at the moment,

568
01:02:06,840 --> 01:02:09,960
they'd push me under a bus
as soon as look at me.

569
01:02:12,970 --> 01:02:14,310
Yeah...

570
01:02:14,600 --> 01:02:17,340
I'm really grateful. I'm really,
really grateful.

571
01:02:17,650 --> 01:02:20,560
Look, you won't be hearing from me again,
I promise.

572
01:02:45,300 --> 01:02:47,290
Here you are.

573
01:02:54,220 --> 01:02:56,640
Here you are, George, you'd better take that.

574
01:02:56,940 --> 01:02:58,550
Christ.

575
01:02:58,850 --> 01:03:02,220
Wait for me at The Colony.
We've got to be at the airport by 6:30.

576
01:03:02,520 --> 01:03:04,060
Jesus, this is a fucking fortune.

577
01:03:04,360 --> 01:03:08,900
Even in your salubrious world, and even in
New York, £500 is not exactly a fortune.

578
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:12,070
- Ta, Francis. I'm really...
- Shut up. Just take it.

579
01:03:14,830 --> 01:03:18,540
And don't let Deakin pick your pocket
while he's fiddling with your cock.

580
01:03:18,830 --> 01:03:20,820
I wouldn't let him near me or my money.

581
01:03:31,890 --> 01:03:33,750
Yes, I know, Isabel.

582
01:03:34,060 --> 01:03:35,970
I know you told me.

583
01:03:39,350 --> 01:03:41,340
Yes, I know.

584
01:03:43,190 --> 01:03:45,180
No. I don't know.

585
01:03:46,280 --> 01:03:49,140
He's probably in one of those bars
at the meat market.

586
01:03:49,450 --> 01:03:52,110
He could be anywhere in Manhattan
for all I care.

587
01:03:53,580 --> 01:03:55,490
No.

588
01:03:55,790 --> 01:03:57,870
No, but it is jolly boring, not knowing.

589
01:03:58,460 --> 01:04:00,450
The hotel have already gone mad.

590
01:04:01,620 --> 01:04:03,540
No, oh, no!

591
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:06,540
It's those fucking rent boys.
I don't know how he finds...

592
01:04:06,840 --> 01:04:10,000
Well, they find him.
He's got some sort of invisible signal.

593
01:04:10,970 --> 01:04:12,960
Hustlers can spot him a mile off.

594
01:04:16,600 --> 01:04:18,310
Darling, I must go.

595
01:04:18,600 --> 01:04:20,810
I've got to go and see the picture in situ.

596
01:04:21,940 --> 01:04:25,050
Yes, another beauty
lost to the corporate wasteland.

597
01:04:26,230 --> 01:04:30,020
Still, the Seagram Building
is rather spectacular,

598
01:04:30,780 --> 01:04:34,150
and I don't suppose
there'll be any shortage of booze.

599
01:04:34,450 --> 01:04:36,280
Come in.

600
01:04:36,580 --> 01:04:38,530
Sorry, darling, somebody's at the door.

601
01:04:38,830 --> 01:04:41,370
Probably the police demanding George's bail.

602
01:04:43,170 --> 01:04:44,530
Yes.

603
01:04:46,380 --> 01:04:48,370
Yes. Goodbye.

604
01:04:49,170 --> 01:04:50,790
Come.

605
01:04:51,630 --> 01:04:53,630
- Good evening, sir.
- Oh, good evening.

606
01:04:53,930 --> 01:04:56,890
I'm sorry to trouble you, Mr Bacon,
but it's your friend Mr Dyer.

607
01:04:57,180 --> 01:05:00,720
- Oh. What is it now?
- I'm afraid he's on the roof
of the building.

608
01:05:01,810 --> 01:05:03,970
- And he says he's gonna jump.
- Ohh!

609
01:05:04,270 --> 01:05:07,510
- We were wondering if you might...
- Come up and give him a push?

610
01:05:07,820 --> 01:05:11,480
No. Er...obviously we'd like you to talk him
back down.

611
01:05:11,780 --> 01:05:13,490
It's very hard for the hotel.

612
01:05:13,780 --> 01:05:15,690
Oh, bloody hell.

613
01:05:26,080 --> 01:05:28,000
Mr Dyer?

614
01:05:28,290 --> 01:05:30,380
Mr Dyer, Mr Bacon's here.

615
01:05:35,180 --> 01:05:36,790
Why don't you just come on up?

616
01:05:37,100 --> 01:05:39,010
And every time the chance of death.

617
01:05:40,470 --> 01:05:43,470
First the waiting, always and endless.

618
01:05:44,140 --> 01:05:47,180
A form of time inexpressible.

619
01:05:48,570 --> 01:05:51,270
Seconds stretched across expectation.

620
01:05:52,570 --> 01:05:54,440
And always endless.

621
01:06:11,460 --> 01:06:15,380
All I'm fucking saying is,
I don't like it when you get queeny.

622
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:19,460
- It makes me fucking nervous.
- 'Ooh, I don't like it, I don't like it.'

623
01:06:20,470 --> 01:06:24,390
You sound like my father.
He was always frightened of the woman in me.

624
01:06:25,140 --> 01:06:29,060
I suppose only the very young
can get away with drag.

625
01:06:29,360 --> 01:06:32,020
Nothing more revolting than old,
painted poofs.

626
01:06:32,650 --> 01:06:36,230
I don't see how the tone of my voice
gets on your nerves.

627
01:06:37,030 --> 01:06:38,940
I think you need a break, George.

628
01:06:42,330 --> 01:06:44,320
Here you are.

629
01:06:47,670 --> 01:06:49,660
Try to use it constructively.

630
01:06:52,630 --> 01:06:55,420
But what about Paris? Am I still coming?

631
01:06:56,260 --> 01:06:59,420
The man had killed the thing he loved
and so he had to Dyer.

632
01:06:59,720 --> 01:07:02,760
Of course you're coming.
You are the exhibition!

633
01:07:09,150 --> 01:07:11,140
You stupid fucking cunt.

634
01:07:25,250 --> 01:07:28,580
Peter Lacey died in Tangiers.

635
01:07:29,540 --> 01:07:31,530
Slumped across his piano, no doubt,

636
01:07:32,170 --> 01:07:35,660
the full night's row of empty G&T glasses

637
01:07:35,960 --> 01:07:37,880
stained with his fingerprints.

638
01:07:38,550 --> 01:07:42,390
Slices of lemon, like little dead fish.

639
01:07:44,510 --> 01:07:48,220
And they told me this the opening night
of my Tate retrospective.

640
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:53,600
George is becoming tedious.

641
01:07:54,400 --> 01:07:56,390
He's a tragedy waiting to happen.

642
01:07:57,570 --> 01:07:59,650
It reminds me of my dear friend Peter.

643
01:08:00,450 --> 01:08:03,480
Like George, he was a little bit greedy.

644
01:08:05,120 --> 01:08:08,740
A sort of compulsive joke
which no-one knew was funny.

645
01:08:10,540 --> 01:08:14,000
There was an inevitability.

646
01:08:16,090 --> 01:08:18,880
His shadow always chasing him.

647
01:08:24,510 --> 01:08:27,720
It's like the flaw in the Japanese pot.

648
01:08:28,020 --> 01:08:29,880
That's what makes it so superb.

649
01:08:30,890 --> 01:08:32,980
There's no beauty without the wound.

650
01:08:33,810 --> 01:08:35,930
Lucifer was the most beautiful angel.

651
01:08:36,820 --> 01:08:38,930
That was his fatal flaw.

652
01:08:39,240 --> 01:08:41,190
Too much like their creator, darling.

653
01:08:41,490 --> 01:08:43,400
Mm.

654
01:08:44,030 --> 01:08:47,900
I'd just like to make one picture
that would annihilate all the rest.

655
01:08:48,200 --> 01:08:50,990
A violent fusion - all the past,
all the present,

656
01:08:51,790 --> 01:08:56,330
concentrated into a single, raw,
sliced-open nerve.

657
01:08:56,630 --> 01:08:58,210
The portraiture of your pain.

658
01:08:58,500 --> 01:08:59,839
Oh!

659
01:08:59,840 --> 01:09:03,420
The tenderness is so visible
in every brush stroke.

660
01:09:03,720 --> 01:09:06,800
The paintings of George
are like exquisite love poems.

661
01:09:08,140 --> 01:09:10,300
That's the irony of the George pictures.

662
01:09:10,600 --> 01:09:14,470
You seem to put more into the work
than into the relationship itself.

663
01:09:15,440 --> 01:09:17,770
And, ultimately, you suffer just as much.

664
01:09:18,480 --> 01:09:21,270
And as we know, Isabel,

665
01:09:21,570 --> 01:09:25,940
those who forget the past
are condemned to repeat it.

666
01:09:27,870 --> 01:09:29,230
Cheerio.

667
01:09:29,540 --> 01:09:32,400
♪ Bobby's Girl

668
01:09:34,290 --> 01:09:36,870
The sad thing about old photographs

669
01:09:37,170 --> 01:09:40,660
is that everybody's dead.

670
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:42,200
Not always.

671
01:09:42,510 --> 01:09:46,970
That's because he likes middle-aged
lorry drivers and I like young boys.

672
01:09:47,260 --> 01:09:49,880
- George, you like me, don't you?
- Yes.

673
01:09:50,720 --> 01:09:52,680
Oi! More champagne!

674
01:09:56,810 --> 01:09:58,220
Cheerio.

675
01:09:58,520 --> 01:10:00,360
Yeah, I like you all.

676
01:10:00,650 --> 01:10:02,560
Because you like me.

677
01:10:03,440 --> 01:10:05,730
You can have whatever you want.

678
01:10:06,320 --> 01:10:08,990
You can have whatever you want, you know?

679
01:10:10,030 --> 01:10:12,030
You want a new suit, it's yours.

680
01:10:12,330 --> 01:10:13,910
Look. Look at this.

681
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:17,290
Fuck it.

682
01:10:17,580 --> 01:10:19,500
Take it easy, mate.

683
01:10:23,090 --> 01:10:24,880
I'll get the little slag.

684
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:28,010
I'll show him. He's...

685
01:10:28,300 --> 01:10:30,210
He thinks he knows it all.

686
01:10:31,220 --> 01:10:35,310
His pieces are fucking horrible anyway.
Who'd want that hanging in their front room?

687
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:37,430
Doesn't even look like the person.

688
01:10:39,110 --> 01:10:43,220
They're just a bunch of shits,
hanging around him like dogs on heat.

689
01:10:43,530 --> 01:10:45,560
They think they're so fucking clever.

690
01:10:46,780 --> 01:10:48,159
No?

691
01:10:48,160 --> 01:10:51,740
All they're trying to do
is get into my knickers behind his back.

692
01:10:52,580 --> 01:10:55,410
A bunch of fucking tarts and poofs
the lot of them.

693
01:10:57,170 --> 01:10:59,160
Here, let's have another bottle.

694
01:12:11,280 --> 01:12:12,900
Hm.

695
01:12:13,200 --> 01:12:16,940
If I cried out, who'd hear me?

696
01:13:04,130 --> 01:13:07,370
Why don't you just go, George?
I've got to get on with this.

697
01:13:07,670 --> 01:13:09,250
I'm going.

698
01:13:10,050 --> 01:13:11,540
I'm going.

699
01:13:12,590 --> 01:13:16,680
Anyway, when you gave me the keys,
it was meant to mean I could live here.

700
01:13:18,100 --> 01:13:20,010
What's past is past.

701
01:13:20,270 --> 01:13:22,300
Oh, you call yesterday the past?

702
01:13:22,600 --> 01:13:25,940
George, I am a painter, this is a studio,

703
01:13:26,230 --> 01:13:27,810
that is a painting.

704
01:13:28,110 --> 01:13:29,390
You are in the way.

705
01:13:29,690 --> 01:13:31,600
But it's a painting of me.

706
01:13:32,570 --> 01:13:34,400
Not that anyone would bloody well notice.

707
01:13:34,700 --> 01:13:39,110
Thank you for the critique, George.
I feel much better now I know where I stand.

708
01:13:39,410 --> 01:13:43,280
After that enlightening discussion,
will you just piss off!

709
01:13:50,170 --> 01:13:51,750
Will I see you later?

710
01:13:54,680 --> 01:13:58,210
- Tomorrow?
- Oh, tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow.

711
01:14:03,940 --> 01:14:05,640
Cheerio.

712
01:14:26,920 --> 01:14:28,830
I don't want to go to Paris.

713
01:14:29,130 --> 01:14:30,580
Put yourself in my shoes.

714
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:33,120
- As if I'd want to.
- You wouldn't like it.

715
01:14:34,090 --> 01:14:36,710
You've no idea, have you? No idea at all.

716
01:14:37,010 --> 01:14:39,840
I don't understand
why you can't get yourself sorted out.

717
01:14:40,140 --> 01:14:43,680
What about this place in Brighton?
I'm told you have quite a little cell...

718
01:14:43,980 --> 01:14:45,720
I hate Brighton, it's so miserable,

719
01:14:46,020 --> 01:14:49,010
the fucking sea just going on and on and on.

720
01:14:49,310 --> 01:14:54,150
Twenty bloody portraits hanging in a space
not graced by an English hand since Turner,

721
01:14:54,440 --> 01:14:56,440
and you don't wanna go.

722
01:14:56,740 --> 01:14:58,650
Sorry. I'm sorry.

723
01:14:59,910 --> 01:15:01,440
Perhaps you should go.

724
01:15:01,740 --> 01:15:04,410
After all, you'll be hanging
in the Grand Palais.

725
01:15:05,580 --> 01:15:10,120
Rather more chic than hanging off some
skyscraper on the wrong side of Manhattan.

726
01:15:10,420 --> 01:15:13,540
There's something about you and falling,
George.

727
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:16,790
So beautifully consistent.

728
01:15:26,930 --> 01:15:30,390
In all the motor accidents I've seen,
people strewn across the road,

729
01:15:30,690 --> 01:15:36,030
the first thing you think of is
the strange beauty, the vision of it,

730
01:15:36,320 --> 01:15:38,440
before you think of trying to do anything.

731
01:15:39,280 --> 01:15:41,440
It's to do with the unusualness of it.

732
01:15:42,660 --> 01:15:45,240
I once saw a bad car accident
on a large road,

733
01:15:45,540 --> 01:15:48,950
and the bodies were strewn about
with broken glass from the car

734
01:15:49,250 --> 01:15:51,330
and the blood and the various possessions,

735
01:15:51,630 --> 01:15:55,370
and it was, in fact, very beautiful.

736
01:15:56,880 --> 01:16:00,420
I think the beauty in it is terribly elusive,

737
01:16:00,720 --> 01:16:05,550
but it just happened to be the disposition
of the bodies, the way they lay in the blood.

738
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:12,770
There you are, you see.
There's no logic to grief.

739
01:16:13,810 --> 01:16:16,230
Just the blistered hole in the pit of my gut.

740
01:16:17,230 --> 01:16:18,940
A banal emptiness.

741
01:16:19,240 --> 01:16:21,480
I say it to journalists but I really mean it.

742
01:16:21,780 --> 01:16:23,610
I'm optimistic about nothing.

743
01:16:23,910 --> 01:16:26,450
George's suicide attempts are so adolescent.

744
01:16:27,450 --> 01:16:29,370
Of course it's a cry for attention

745
01:16:29,660 --> 01:16:32,910
but he seems to turn it into a sort of art.

746
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:35,870
He never really wants to die.

747
01:16:36,170 --> 01:16:38,880
He just does it to find out
if he can hurt me.

748
01:16:39,840 --> 01:16:41,830
I know how much he means to you.

749
01:16:42,550 --> 01:16:45,420
And I know your tastes lead you
onto the beaten track,

750
01:16:45,720 --> 01:16:48,710
but I know George
and I know he'd never really hurt you.

751
01:16:48,970 --> 01:16:50,890
More's the pity.

752
01:16:51,980 --> 01:16:53,680
No, Isabel.

753
01:16:53,980 --> 01:16:55,890
George has other qualities.

754
01:16:57,940 --> 01:17:00,900
I lie there looking at that profile.

755
01:17:01,490 --> 01:17:04,730
The nose, the shy, devious eyes.

756
01:17:05,490 --> 01:17:07,280
The mouth, that skin.

757
01:17:08,080 --> 01:17:10,570
I start doing sort of X-rays in my head.

758
01:17:11,210 --> 01:17:14,040
Yes, dear, but he's not just a photo
you can pin to the wall

759
01:17:14,330 --> 01:17:16,120
then throw to the floor once you're done.

760
01:17:16,420 --> 01:17:20,080
Well, there you are, you see.
He's even bloody here when he's not here!

761
01:17:20,380 --> 01:17:23,040
No, Isabel, George is all right.
It's just that...

762
01:17:23,340 --> 01:17:25,130
he has a hard time keeping up, that's all.

763
01:17:25,430 --> 01:17:29,970
I think he thinks these altered states
make him a teeny-weeny bit more special.

764
01:17:30,890 --> 01:17:33,010
You could say it's his gimmick.

765
01:17:33,310 --> 01:17:35,550
Look, I like George, Francis.

766
01:17:35,860 --> 01:17:38,890
I just think he should see someone
or at least have a holiday.

767
01:17:39,190 --> 01:17:42,180
When I saw him in the French pub
he could hardly stand up.

768
01:17:42,490 --> 01:17:46,570
And between Deakin and two rent boys he was
being divested of quite a sum of money.

769
01:17:46,870 --> 01:17:49,650
Frankly, he looked rather like a corpse.

770
01:17:49,950 --> 01:17:53,870
Isabel, darling, George is a grown man.

771
01:17:55,040 --> 01:17:57,030
My work drains me at the best of times.

772
01:17:57,330 --> 01:18:00,200
No, no. George is perfectly happy.

773
01:18:00,500 --> 01:18:03,750
He's just celebrating
coming to the new show in Paris.

774
01:18:04,050 --> 01:18:06,710
Oh, Francis, you can't be serious. You can't!

775
01:18:07,010 --> 01:18:10,850
The fact is he needs a bloody detox clinic,
or at least psychiatric help.

776
01:18:11,140 --> 01:18:13,010
Why are you doing this?

777
01:18:13,980 --> 01:18:15,590
I've already bought the tickets.

778
01:18:21,690 --> 01:18:23,850
Time is not a healing instrument.

779
01:18:24,150 --> 01:18:25,990
That's all bollocks.

780
01:18:26,280 --> 01:18:28,110
I'd miss her.

781
01:18:28,410 --> 01:18:30,320
I'd miss her sweaty armpits.

782
01:18:30,950 --> 01:18:32,610
Her socks.

783
01:18:32,910 --> 01:18:36,700
I'd miss the stubble dried round
the bathroom sink when I go to shave.

784
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,830
I'd miss the sound of his key
as it turns in the lock.

785
01:18:41,630 --> 01:18:46,220
I'd like just one more night
of cowering under him.

786
01:18:47,510 --> 01:18:49,500
One more night of love,

787
01:18:50,260 --> 01:18:52,050
of true affection.

788
01:18:53,220 --> 01:18:55,680
And a few more days of tenderness.

789
01:18:56,770 --> 01:18:59,600
But, after all, in the end, what's left?

790
01:19:00,440 --> 01:19:02,350
A pile of bones

791
01:19:02,650 --> 01:19:04,560
and a few teeth.

792
01:20:08,970 --> 01:20:10,960
I've had to change to be with you.

793
01:20:13,180 --> 01:20:15,970
I'm always watching myself,
making sure I behave properly.

794
01:20:16,270 --> 01:20:17,680
Yes, we had noticed.

795
01:20:17,980 --> 01:20:19,890
I only know how I feel.

796
01:20:22,310 --> 01:20:24,310
I'm making a real effort.

797
01:20:29,400 --> 01:20:31,070
What am I supposed to do?

798
01:20:31,360 --> 01:20:33,860
Deakin is here to look after you.

799
01:20:36,040 --> 01:20:37,650
Your chaperone.

800
01:20:37,950 --> 01:20:39,440
Keep you out of my hair.

801
01:20:39,750 --> 01:20:43,540
- Yeah, if he can stand up.
- Calm down, George, or take another pill.

802
01:20:48,260 --> 01:20:49,960
I love you, Francis.

803
01:20:50,260 --> 01:20:53,920
Where do you get your slogans from, George?
Off the television?

804
01:21:55,570 --> 01:21:59,820
La ville de Paris a le très grand plaisir
d'accueillir Monsieur Francis Bacon

805
01:22:01,040 --> 01:22:03,870
à ce vernissage qui annonce
l'exposition de son oeuvre à Paris.

806
01:22:05,920 --> 01:22:09,210
Monsieur Bacon est le premier peintre anglais
depuis Turner

807
01:22:09,500 --> 01:22:13,000
à recevoir l'honneur
de montrer son oeuvre au Grand Palais.

808
01:22:14,260 --> 01:22:17,300
Cette exposition situe Monsieur Bacon
parmi les grands maîtres

809
01:22:17,590 --> 01:22:19,180
de la peinture contemporaine.

810
01:22:20,260 --> 01:22:22,970
Son oeuvre nous renvoie
à notre condition humaine

811
01:22:23,270 --> 01:22:25,180
et nous révèle sa beauté et sa souffrance.

812
01:25:25,320 --> 01:25:28,570
Oh, Francis, the show's really wonderful.

813
01:25:28,870 --> 01:25:30,950
It's marvellous.

814
01:25:31,250 --> 01:25:34,740
I must say, I'm so sorry to hear
about George. Really awful.

815
01:25:35,040 --> 01:25:37,380
Well, dear, one can only laugh or cry. Hm?

816
01:25:37,670 --> 01:25:39,580
Boo-hoo.

817
01:25:42,010 --> 01:25:44,920
She's about as interesting
as a vase of her tulips.

818
01:26:18,090 --> 01:26:20,080
Everything is running down.

819
01:26:21,050 --> 01:26:23,040
The sun is burning out,

820
01:26:24,170 --> 01:26:26,170
the stars are burning out.

821
01:26:26,970 --> 01:26:29,380
It's the only thing in life that's certain -

822
01:26:30,180 --> 01:26:32,170
that it's all running down.

823
01:26:32,810 --> 01:26:34,800
It's all dying.

824
01:27:18,770 --> 01:27:20,760
Cheerio!

825
01:27:31,740 --> 01:27:34,950
♪ Time on my hands

826
01:27:35,870 --> 01:27:39,360
♪ You in my arms

827
01:27:39,920 --> 01:27:47,670
♪ Nothing but love in view

828
01:27:48,050 --> 01:27:51,710
♪ Then if you fall

829
01:27:52,220 --> 01:27:55,880
♪ Once and for all

830
01:27:56,140 --> 01:28:03,360
♪ I'll see my dreams come true

831
01:28:04,150 --> 01:28:07,020
♪ Moments to spare

832
01:28:07,320 --> 01:28:12,110
♪ For someone you care for

833
01:28:12,410 --> 01:28:14,950
♪ One love affair

834
01:28:15,240 --> 01:28:19,160
♪ For two

835
01:28:20,040 --> 01:28:23,450
♪ With time on my hands

836
01:28:24,210 --> 01:28:27,750
♪ And you in my arms

837
01:28:28,470 --> 01:28:34,880
♪ And love in my heart all for you
