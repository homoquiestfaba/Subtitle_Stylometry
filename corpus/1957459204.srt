1
00:00:00,634 --> 00:00:04,203
(upbeat Christmas music)

2
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:27,693
- oh yes. Great.

3
00:00:27,728 --> 00:00:29,628
Those will go in the
dining room. Thank you.

4
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:33,532
(movers chattering)

5
00:00:33,567 --> 00:00:34,400
hm.

6
00:00:41,776 --> 00:00:42,908
(bells chiming)

7
00:00:42,943 --> 00:00:45,577
- at upstage we need to
accentuate the selling points

8
00:00:45,613 --> 00:00:48,347
of the home to entice the
widest array of buyers.

9
00:00:48,382 --> 00:00:51,283
We're the last stage you'll
have before selling your home.

10
00:00:51,318 --> 00:00:53,352
This is grace Ryan,
my partner in design

11
00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:55,354
and the other half of upstaged.

12
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:57,056
- Nice to meet you.

13
00:00:57,091 --> 00:01:00,025
I hope you're okay we moved
the Paola buffa side table.

14
00:01:00,061 --> 00:01:02,061
It was hidden in that guest
room and we really thought it

15
00:01:02,096 --> 00:01:05,064
would bring the dining
room that wow-factor.

16
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:06,899
- The buffa what?

17
00:01:06,934 --> 00:01:10,569
- The walnut side table
handmade by one of the premier

18
00:01:10,604 --> 00:01:13,272
European furniture makers
of the 20th century.

19
00:01:16,811 --> 00:01:17,943
The brown table with
the ridged drawers

20
00:01:17,978 --> 00:01:19,178
and the brass handles.

21
00:01:19,213 --> 00:01:22,247
- Oh that. I mostly keep my
workout clothes on it anyway.

22
00:01:22,283 --> 00:01:25,250
- Oh, you keep your workout
clothes on a Paola buffa.

23
00:01:25,286 --> 00:01:26,552
- Well the treadmills
in there, ha,

24
00:01:26,587 --> 00:01:28,887
never liked the look
of it, to be honest.

25
00:01:28,923 --> 00:01:30,823
- Can you excuse us
for just a moment?

26
00:01:30,858 --> 00:01:32,724
Take a look around and let
me know how you like the rest

27
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:33,625
of the house.

28
00:01:37,131 --> 00:01:39,832
Putting the buffa on the
dining room was a bold choice.

29
00:01:39,867 --> 00:01:43,902
Now that is see it, it's
a little loud, isn't it?

30
00:01:43,938 --> 00:01:46,772
- I thought it gave the
room a pop of style.

31
00:01:46,807 --> 00:01:49,074
- Perhaps it's more
like an explosion.

32
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:50,242
- Right.

33
00:01:50,277 --> 00:01:51,076
- We want people
talking about the room,

34
00:01:51,112 --> 00:01:52,077
not the table, right?

35
00:01:52,113 --> 00:01:53,979
- Yes. I will get them
over to switch it out.

36
00:01:54,014 --> 00:01:54,980
- And while they're at it,

37
00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:57,349
let's ask them to switch
the artwork in the den.

38
00:01:57,384 --> 00:01:58,283
- Oh, really?

39
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:01,086
I was really digging
those old french adverts

40
00:02:01,122 --> 00:02:02,621
that fit in there.

41
00:02:02,656 --> 00:02:04,456
- You don't think it looks
a little too nineties?

42
00:02:06,026 --> 00:02:09,027
I almost forgot, the
producers called.

43
00:02:09,063 --> 00:02:10,829
- Really? What,
what did they say?

44
00:02:10,865 --> 00:02:12,598
- They want to sit with
us after the holidays,

45
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:15,534
talking through our vision
for a home staging show.

46
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:17,035
- That's amazing.

47
00:02:17,071 --> 00:02:19,037
- Said we make a dynamic duo.

48
00:02:19,073 --> 00:02:22,040
This could be huge for
us, for our company.

49
00:02:22,076 --> 00:02:24,610
Our own tv show,
grace. Think about it.

50
00:02:25,813 --> 00:02:27,279
Listen, I'll finish up here.

51
00:02:27,314 --> 00:02:29,348
I'm sure your family's
eager to have you at home.

52
00:02:29,383 --> 00:02:30,048
- Are you sure?

53
00:02:30,084 --> 00:02:33,018
- Definitely. Go, I got this.

54
00:02:35,256 --> 00:02:37,289
Actually, before you go,

55
00:02:37,324 --> 00:02:40,125
think we can move that
back to where it was?

56
00:02:40,161 --> 00:02:42,327
- Yes. Of course. I'm on it.

57
00:02:43,597 --> 00:02:45,864
(sighs)

58
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:48,534
(gentle music)

59
00:02:51,572 --> 00:02:56,542
(engine revving)
(tires spinning)

60
00:02:57,678 --> 00:02:59,244
looks like someone
needs some help.

61
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:04,316
(engine revving)
(tires spinning)

62
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:07,319
oh.

63
00:03:09,056 --> 00:03:11,223
Yep, I think you're stuck.

64
00:03:12,893 --> 00:03:14,059
Tony Scotto.

65
00:03:14,094 --> 00:03:15,928
- Grace Ryan.

66
00:03:15,963 --> 00:03:18,063
Wow. It has been-

67
00:03:18,098 --> 00:03:19,431
- it's been a while.
- Yeah.

68
00:03:19,466 --> 00:03:21,767
- Yeah. What happened here?

69
00:03:21,802 --> 00:03:24,269
- Oh, this is deer darted
out and I did what I could

70
00:03:24,305 --> 00:03:26,205
to avoid it, but here we are.

71
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,440
- Well they probably thought
they saw their cousin back here

72
00:03:28,475 --> 00:03:29,908
and got excited.

73
00:03:29,944 --> 00:03:31,843
- (laughs) good one.

74
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:32,945
Very good.

75
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:34,580
- Couldn't help myself. (laughs)

76
00:03:34,615 --> 00:03:36,748
actually, do you have
some rubber mats in there?

77
00:03:36,784 --> 00:03:38,584
- Yeah. Why?

78
00:03:38,619 --> 00:03:40,419
- Hand them over?
I'll show you a trick.

79
00:03:43,257 --> 00:03:44,990
Aha. Perfect.

80
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,359
Ready?

81
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:49,194
Hop in. Get ready
to give it some gas.

82
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:50,729
- Okay.
- There we go.

83
00:03:50,764 --> 00:03:52,531
That should give you some
traction. Try it now.

84
00:03:55,002 --> 00:03:57,836
(engine revving)

85
00:04:01,842 --> 00:04:03,308
all right.
- Hey.

86
00:04:03,344 --> 00:04:05,377
That's a pretty great trick.

87
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:07,112
Thanks for coming to my rescue.

88
00:04:07,147 --> 00:04:08,413
- Eh. It's the girl scout in me.

89
00:04:08,449 --> 00:04:10,582
I can't help myself.
Now it's all yours.

90
00:04:10,618 --> 00:04:12,884
You can unstick
yourself anytime.

91
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,786
- Any advice if I get a flat?

92
00:04:14,822 --> 00:04:16,888
- Yeah. Call AAA.

93
00:04:16,924 --> 00:04:17,723
(both laughing)

94
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:18,991
(phone ringing)

95
00:04:19,026 --> 00:04:19,891
oh.

96
00:04:21,028 --> 00:04:22,828
Um, I'm sorry. I
should take this.

97
00:04:22,863 --> 00:04:24,296
- No, that's okay.

98
00:04:24,331 --> 00:04:26,331
I should get going too,
but thanks for your help.

99
00:04:26,367 --> 00:04:29,901
And it was a nice
to see you again.

100
00:04:29,937 --> 00:04:30,869
- Nice to see you.

101
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:32,738
- Happy holidays.

102
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:33,772
- You too.

103
00:04:33,807 --> 00:04:35,340
Oh, don't forget your map.

104
00:04:35,376 --> 00:04:36,608
- Oh, right.

105
00:04:36,644 --> 00:04:37,876
- Hey Sarah. What's up?

106
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,479
Oh, okay.

107
00:04:40,514 --> 00:04:43,248
So you're not feeling the look
of the living room anymore.

108
00:04:44,551 --> 00:04:47,753
Got it. Yeah. Okay. I'll
be there in a minute.

109
00:04:54,161 --> 00:04:56,495
- Pop. Come on. Still
with the icicles?

110
00:04:57,798 --> 00:05:00,265
- Hey, it's a Christmas classic.

111
00:05:00,301 --> 00:05:01,700
They take time.

112
00:05:01,735 --> 00:05:03,869
You got to give the
people what they want.

113
00:05:03,904 --> 00:05:05,037
- You know what the people want?

114
00:05:05,072 --> 00:05:07,272
The people want their Christmas
decorations by Christmas,

115
00:05:07,308 --> 00:05:08,273
not valentine's day.

116
00:05:08,309 --> 00:05:09,808
That's what the people want.

117
00:05:09,843 --> 00:05:12,711
- Your father will be up all
night if it's not perfect.

118
00:05:12,746 --> 00:05:15,280
And if he's up all
night, I'm up all night.

119
00:05:15,316 --> 00:05:18,350
Just let him do what he
needs to do for my sake.

120
00:05:18,385 --> 00:05:19,951
- Where do you want these, dad?

121
00:05:19,987 --> 00:05:22,554
- Oh, well the lights on the
trees are going to pull focus.

122
00:05:22,589 --> 00:05:25,957
So we need to balance out
the lawn, frame the house.

123
00:05:27,227 --> 00:05:28,860
Put them right there.

124
00:05:28,896 --> 00:05:30,362
- Here?
- Yes. Perfect.

125
00:05:31,999 --> 00:05:32,798
Thank you.

126
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:33,799
- You got it.

127
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:37,536
- Hey,

128
00:05:37,571 --> 00:05:39,705
whatever happened to that
marketing job you applied for?

129
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:42,307
- Same thing that
always happens.

130
00:05:42,343 --> 00:05:43,275
It was a pleasure to meet me,

131
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:45,744
but they decided to
go with somebody else.

132
00:05:45,779 --> 00:05:47,179
- Something will workout.

133
00:05:50,351 --> 00:05:51,483
- Oh. Oh. (groans)

134
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:52,317
- oh! Are you
okay? Are you okay?

135
00:05:52,353 --> 00:05:53,285
- Ah. Yeah. Yeah.

136
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,219
I'm good. I'm good.
- Okay. Just watch it.

137
00:05:54,254 --> 00:05:55,120
- Slow, slow.

138
00:05:56,623 --> 00:05:57,789
You know,

139
00:05:57,825 --> 00:06:00,325
we should start charging by
the day instead of the job.

140
00:06:00,361 --> 00:06:03,428
How many houses have
we done this year, six?

141
00:06:03,464 --> 00:06:05,530
- Yep. And we did
eight last year.

142
00:06:05,566 --> 00:06:08,600
- We used to do 20
houses a year at least.

143
00:06:08,635 --> 00:06:10,702
His numbers have really
taken a nose-dive ever since

144
00:06:10,738 --> 00:06:12,938
he stopped competing in
the bright nights contest.

145
00:06:12,973 --> 00:06:16,608
- Talk to him. See if he's
ready to compete again.

146
00:06:16,643 --> 00:06:19,177
The deadline to
submit is tonight.

147
00:06:19,213 --> 00:06:21,279
All we have to do is
drop the application off

148
00:06:21,315 --> 00:06:22,447
at the Christmas fest.

149
00:06:22,483 --> 00:06:24,683
- Why do I have to do it?
Couldn't we do it together?

150
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:27,219
- No. You're the oldest.

151
00:06:27,254 --> 00:06:29,688
I gotta pick Dante up at hockey.

152
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:31,790
You got this.
- Mm.

153
00:06:31,825 --> 00:06:33,525
- I'm heading out.

154
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,860
- Oh, I want to go with you.

155
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:36,395
I got a few things to pick up.

156
00:06:37,264 --> 00:06:39,197
All right. Well we're
far enough along.

157
00:06:39,233 --> 00:06:40,732
You two can finish by yourself.

158
00:06:40,768 --> 00:06:41,967
- Sure we can.

159
00:06:42,002 --> 00:06:43,535
- We'll be back in an hour.

160
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:44,936
- Bye.
- Bye.

161
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,039
- Well, guess we'd
better get a move on

162
00:06:48,075 --> 00:06:51,910
so we can finish before
the family gets back.

163
00:06:56,984 --> 00:06:58,617
(people clapping)

164
00:06:58,652 --> 00:06:59,885
- thank you. Thank you.

165
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,786
Means a lot.

166
00:07:01,655 --> 00:07:05,357
From my family to
yours, merry Christmas.

167
00:07:06,527 --> 00:07:09,594
(people chattering)

168
00:07:11,331 --> 00:07:12,998
- looks amazing, pop.

169
00:07:13,033 --> 00:07:15,767
- I should have brought
two more reindeer.

170
00:07:15,803 --> 00:07:18,770
- Let it go, dad.
Just let it go.

171
00:07:18,806 --> 00:07:19,704
- Okay.

172
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:24,910
- I sanded the whole thing down,

173
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:27,312
patched up all the dings and
nicks and stained it back

174
00:07:27,347 --> 00:07:28,847
to its original color.

175
00:07:28,882 --> 00:07:31,683
- My wife used to nurse
her son in this chair.

176
00:07:31,718 --> 00:07:34,586
Now he just had his first and
we wanted to pass it down.

177
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:37,088
- Well, it should hold up for
a couple more generations.

178
00:07:37,124 --> 00:07:38,757
- It's beautiful, bill.

179
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:40,826
Was glad to see your
lights still on.

180
00:07:40,861 --> 00:07:43,829
Heard rumor you might be
closing the stores down.

181
00:07:43,864 --> 00:07:45,597
- (laughs) that's a long...

182
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:46,798
No plans to yet anyway.

183
00:07:46,834 --> 00:07:49,701
- [customer] I see you're still
in the decorating business.

184
00:07:49,736 --> 00:07:51,670
Noticed your yard signs around.

185
00:07:51,705 --> 00:07:53,205
- Yeah, that's right.

186
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,040
Geared up for the bright
nights contest again, too.

187
00:07:55,075 --> 00:07:57,943
You know, going up against all
those professional decorators

188
00:07:57,978 --> 00:07:58,710
in town,

189
00:07:58,745 --> 00:08:00,812
mm, keeps on your toes.

190
00:08:00,848 --> 00:08:02,180
- Good luck.

191
00:08:02,216 --> 00:08:03,715
Well, thank you very much.

192
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,116
Now, Larry upfront will
ring you out and help you

193
00:08:05,152 --> 00:08:07,052
to the car with it, okay?

194
00:08:07,087 --> 00:08:08,019
There you go.

195
00:08:08,055 --> 00:08:09,654
- Hi, dad.

196
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:11,122
- Hey, kiddo!

197
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:12,390
- Aww.

198
00:08:12,426 --> 00:08:14,726
- So nice to have
you home this year.

199
00:08:14,761 --> 00:08:15,694
You know, you've
been gone so long

200
00:08:15,729 --> 00:08:18,663
and your nephew Evan's
got his license now.

201
00:08:18,699 --> 00:08:20,232
- (laughs) okay, first of
all, you need to let it go

202
00:08:20,267 --> 00:08:23,468
that I went on holiday vacation
someplace warm for once.

203
00:08:23,504 --> 00:08:25,403
You should try it some time.

204
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:27,706
And second, I know how to count.

205
00:08:27,741 --> 00:08:29,474
Evan is only nine.

206
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:30,909
- Ten.

207
00:08:30,944 --> 00:08:33,311
- Oh right. November
9th, of course.

208
00:08:33,347 --> 00:08:34,813
- (laughs) come on.

209
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:36,314
- Your mom and Evan
are in the back.

210
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:38,850
- Oh, I saw a paolo
buffa side table today.

211
00:08:38,886 --> 00:08:40,218
It was a thing of beauty.

212
00:08:40,254 --> 00:08:41,887
- Really? Tell me all about it.

213
00:08:43,056 --> 00:08:45,156
- Hey! There's my girl.

214
00:08:45,192 --> 00:08:46,291
- Aunt grace!

215
00:08:46,326 --> 00:08:50,161
- Evan! What's new, kid?
Grandpa says you're driving now.

216
00:08:50,197 --> 00:08:51,863
- No, not yet.
- Not yet.

217
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:54,432
- With your sister and her
husband working so much overtime

218
00:08:54,468 --> 00:08:55,600
right now,

219
00:08:55,636 --> 00:08:57,536
Evan has offered to help
with bright nights this year.

220
00:08:57,571 --> 00:09:01,373
- Good man. Speaking
of which, here you go.

221
00:09:02,409 --> 00:09:03,308
Yeah.

222
00:09:04,144 --> 00:09:05,076
- What do we got here?

223
00:09:05,112 --> 00:09:07,679
- Photos of the house
we decorated this year.

224
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:09,347
What do you think?

225
00:09:09,383 --> 00:09:11,416
Just narrowing
down my submission.

226
00:09:11,451 --> 00:09:12,384
- Right.

227
00:09:13,287 --> 00:09:15,287
Some of these sort of
remind me of the designs

228
00:09:15,322 --> 00:09:16,955
from a few years ago,

229
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:19,424
except you subbed the
snowflakes for the candy canes.

230
00:09:19,459 --> 00:09:20,358
What?

231
00:09:21,094 --> 00:09:22,961
- We're getting stale.
- No.

232
00:09:22,996 --> 00:09:24,896
- Yep, like January gingerbread.

233
00:09:24,932 --> 00:09:27,198
- Now I wouldn't
say that, it just...

234
00:09:27,234 --> 00:09:30,035
It never hurts to push
the creative edges, right?

235
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:31,903
- Well, what we may
lack in variety,

236
00:09:31,939 --> 00:09:34,205
we make up for in volume.

237
00:09:34,241 --> 00:09:36,775
I mean, how many houses
did we do this season, 30?

238
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:37,976
30, right?

239
00:09:38,011 --> 00:09:39,244
- Something like that.

240
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:40,378
- Oh.

241
00:09:40,414 --> 00:09:43,315
- Oh, here you go. These
should be your submissions.

242
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:44,149
- I wanna see.

243
00:09:44,184 --> 00:09:45,150
- Okay.

244
00:09:45,185 --> 00:09:47,252
- Ooh.
- What do you think?

245
00:09:47,287 --> 00:09:48,787
- Yeah?

246
00:09:48,822 --> 00:09:52,490
Okay. Let's get this
application into the committee.

247
00:09:52,526 --> 00:09:54,726
- You know, we really
need your spark, dear.

248
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:57,295
It's what all of our
designs are missing.

249
00:09:57,331 --> 00:09:58,563
- Oh.

250
00:09:58,599 --> 00:10:01,099
- I mean, you could
be our saving grace.

251
00:10:01,134 --> 00:10:01,933
- Oh. (laughs)

252
00:10:01,969 --> 00:10:03,001
oh, bill.

253
00:10:03,036 --> 00:10:05,170
- What?
- Talk about stale.

254
00:10:05,205 --> 00:10:06,504
(laughing)

255
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:07,939
come on, kiddo.

256
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:11,843
- I wanted to talk to
you about good tidings.

257
00:10:11,878 --> 00:10:13,011
- What about it?

258
00:10:13,046 --> 00:10:15,146
- Well, I know how you like
to take a lot of time off

259
00:10:15,182 --> 00:10:18,083
from contracting during the
holidays to focus on decorating,

260
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:20,518
but with the number of clients
being what they'd been the

261
00:10:20,554 --> 00:10:21,453
last couple of years,

262
00:10:21,488 --> 00:10:22,687
you're losing a lot
more than you're making.

263
00:10:22,723 --> 00:10:24,456
- No, stop. Stop here.
- What?

264
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:26,758
- What is this?

265
00:10:28,228 --> 00:10:29,861
- Is that the inglid's house?

266
00:10:29,896 --> 00:10:31,463
- It is.

267
00:10:31,498 --> 00:10:33,131
- They've been a
customer of yours for...

268
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:34,065
- 10 years.

269
00:10:35,235 --> 00:10:38,870
- Guess they decided to go a
different direction this year.

270
00:10:38,905 --> 00:10:39,838
- I guess they did.

271
00:10:41,908 --> 00:10:44,275
What the heck is glowscapes?

272
00:10:44,311 --> 00:10:46,344
- I think we're looking at it.

273
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:48,013
- Popular, by the looks of it.

274
00:10:48,915 --> 00:10:50,115
- Looks like it's
easy to set up too.

275
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:53,118
I bet you could do a few of
those in one day, no problem.

276
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:54,953
- Anybody can string
up a bunch of lights

277
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:57,622
and enter a computer code.

278
00:10:57,658 --> 00:10:58,857
Where's the soul in that?

279
00:10:59,893 --> 00:11:00,959
The heart?

280
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:02,394
Do you see the people's faces

281
00:11:02,429 --> 00:11:04,663
when I flip the light switch on,

282
00:11:04,698 --> 00:11:07,132
that spark of joy in their eyes?

283
00:11:08,268 --> 00:11:11,870
All because of
something we've created.

284
00:11:12,773 --> 00:11:13,705
I mean, it's-

285
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:14,973
- magical.
- It is.

286
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:15,674
- I know.

287
00:11:15,709 --> 00:11:17,475
And I love how it lights you up.

288
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:21,246
But without the bump
from bright nights,

289
00:11:21,281 --> 00:11:24,182
good tidings is becoming more
of a hobby than a business.

290
00:11:24,217 --> 00:11:25,583
- It's not always
about the money.

291
00:11:25,619 --> 00:11:28,253
- I know, but why don't
you show the people

292
00:11:28,288 --> 00:11:30,221
of this town what
you're capable of?

293
00:11:31,358 --> 00:11:33,224
There's a reason you won
the first five bright nights

294
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:34,192
contests.

295
00:11:35,429 --> 00:11:36,661
- I don't think so.

296
00:11:36,697 --> 00:11:39,431
- Dad, come on.

297
00:11:39,466 --> 00:11:42,100
- I haven't competed
in eight years.

298
00:11:42,135 --> 00:11:44,703
And you remember what
happened last time?

299
00:11:44,738 --> 00:11:45,670
- Yeah, sure.

300
00:11:45,706 --> 00:11:47,739
You ran out of time.
You got disqualified.

301
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:53,745
But so what, that's not
going to happen this time.

302
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:57,449
I'm going to be there and
mom's going to be there

303
00:11:57,484 --> 00:11:58,850
and maria is going to be there.

304
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:00,018
- Really?

305
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:02,787
- Yes. Maria said she'd help
fill out the application.

306
00:12:02,823 --> 00:12:05,824
We can get it to the committee
before registration closes.

307
00:12:06,927 --> 00:12:08,593
You're the best in town, pop.

308
00:12:09,496 --> 00:12:11,830
I mean, it says it right
there on your signs.

309
00:12:18,171 --> 00:12:19,571
- Okay.

310
00:12:19,606 --> 00:12:20,405
- Yeah?

311
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,406
- Let's do it.

312
00:12:21,441 --> 00:12:22,407
- Okay.

313
00:12:22,442 --> 00:12:23,274
- Okay.

314
00:12:24,611 --> 00:12:27,512
(engine starting)

315
00:12:32,185 --> 00:12:34,953
(bells jingling)

316
00:12:41,128 --> 00:12:44,195
(people chattering)

317
00:12:45,499 --> 00:12:48,399
- so we staged the
home of this producer

318
00:12:48,435 --> 00:12:51,336
and they got a kick out of us,

319
00:12:51,371 --> 00:12:55,106
thought that we made a charming
team, their words, not mine.

320
00:12:56,009 --> 00:12:59,344
Anyway, they said that
we'd make a fun host

321
00:12:59,379 --> 00:13:01,179
for a home staging show.

322
00:13:01,214 --> 00:13:02,447
- Oh.
- I know.

323
00:13:02,482 --> 00:13:04,682
Anyway, we're going to talk to
them in the new year about it

324
00:13:04,718 --> 00:13:06,084
and we'll see what happens.

325
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:07,752
- That is incredible, grace.

326
00:13:07,788 --> 00:13:09,721
- Yeah. Yeah. It is just...

327
00:13:11,224 --> 00:13:12,657
- What?

328
00:13:12,692 --> 00:13:14,425
- Sarah and I have been
on different pages lately,

329
00:13:14,461 --> 00:13:17,095
just completely out of sync.

330
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:20,031
- Being friends and
business partners

331
00:13:20,066 --> 00:13:22,500
takes a delicate touch.

332
00:13:22,536 --> 00:13:23,968
Ask your father.

333
00:13:24,004 --> 00:13:25,937
He still avoids every
street with a house designed

334
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:27,806
by the scottos. (laughs)

335
00:13:27,841 --> 00:13:29,874
- yeah, well you'd think 20
years would be enough time

336
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:31,342
for bygones to be bygones.

337
00:13:31,378 --> 00:13:33,611
- Ha ha. Not a chance.

338
00:13:35,081 --> 00:13:36,447
- Did you ask Santa
for what you wanted?

339
00:13:36,483 --> 00:13:39,951
- A secrets of the great
magicians magic set.

340
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:43,488
- Oh, so you're into magic
these days. That's pretty cool.

341
00:13:43,523 --> 00:13:44,656
- Lean down, aunt grace.

342
00:13:44,691 --> 00:13:45,590
- Okay.

343
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:48,393
What've we got here?

344
00:13:48,428 --> 00:13:51,596
Okay. Oh boy. Starting out good.

345
00:13:55,535 --> 00:13:59,470
Whoa! That is
incredible. Nicely done.

346
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:01,806
Okay, now can you do that
with a chicken sandwich

347
00:14:01,842 --> 00:14:03,174
because I am starving.

348
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:04,075
- I can't, aunt grace.

349
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:05,810
- You let me down, kid.

350
00:14:05,846 --> 00:14:07,078
All right.

351
00:14:07,113 --> 00:14:08,546
Well, I'm going to
grab something to eat,

352
00:14:08,582 --> 00:14:10,548
but I'll meet you guys at
the bright nights booth?

353
00:14:10,584 --> 00:14:12,984
- Yep. Okay, come
on you. Good work.

354
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:15,553
- How did you get dad
to change his mind

355
00:14:15,589 --> 00:14:16,855
about bright nights?

356
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:19,324
- How do you think? I
appealed to his ego.

357
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:21,860
He saw a bunch of people lining
up to see a house decorated

358
00:14:21,895 --> 00:14:23,862
by that new company, glowscapes.

359
00:14:23,897 --> 00:14:26,264
I think that really
lit a fire under him.

360
00:14:26,299 --> 00:14:27,498
- Nono can bring it.

361
00:14:27,534 --> 00:14:28,733
- Yes.

362
00:14:28,768 --> 00:14:30,535
- Let's hope that attention
to detail that makes him such

363
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:32,537
a great contractor doesn't
freeze him up this year.

364
00:14:32,572 --> 00:14:34,906
- If we get into
bright night finals,

365
00:14:34,941 --> 00:14:37,375
I'm telling you we can win it.

366
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:40,378
- If, ifs and buts
were candy and nuts,

367
00:14:40,413 --> 00:14:42,580
what a merry
Christmas it would be.

368
00:14:47,554 --> 00:14:49,454
- Two pizzelles, please.

369
00:14:49,489 --> 00:14:51,723
- What he said. Thank you.

370
00:14:54,461 --> 00:14:57,962
And a half dozen
assorted, please.

371
00:14:57,998 --> 00:15:01,266
- That's a lot, uncle
tony. Not good for you.

372
00:15:01,301 --> 00:15:02,734
- Well, they're not for me.

373
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:04,569
Thank you.

374
00:15:07,841 --> 00:15:08,740
Excuse me.

375
00:15:09,876 --> 00:15:12,577
I know it's usually the girl
scouts giving the cookies,

376
00:15:12,612 --> 00:15:14,112
but I wanted to thank
you for the other day.

377
00:15:14,147 --> 00:15:16,447
- It wasn't anything really.

378
00:15:17,317 --> 00:15:19,417
- If you were your
dad and I was my dad,

379
00:15:19,452 --> 00:15:22,220
you would have just kept
driving, so it's not nothing.

380
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:25,823
- Well, fortunately, we're
not our fathers. (laughs)

381
00:15:25,859 --> 00:15:28,726
and who is this young
man? Is this your son?

382
00:15:28,762 --> 00:15:31,296
- No, no, no, no. This
is my nephew, Dante.

383
00:15:31,331 --> 00:15:32,730
- What are you
talking about, dad?

384
00:15:32,766 --> 00:15:34,332
- Oh.

385
00:15:34,367 --> 00:15:35,767
- Quit playing, Dante.

386
00:15:35,802 --> 00:15:38,002
He's my sister maria's kid.

387
00:15:38,038 --> 00:15:39,604
- Who's maria, dad?

388
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:41,472
- All right. Cut it out.

389
00:15:41,508 --> 00:15:42,941
He thinks he's funny.

390
00:15:42,976 --> 00:15:44,142
- Well I'm entertained.

391
00:15:45,345 --> 00:15:46,778
- You want these?

392
00:15:46,813 --> 00:15:48,980
- Yes, uncle tony.

393
00:15:50,116 --> 00:15:51,516
- Get.

394
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:52,984
I think I see maria over there.

395
00:15:54,955 --> 00:15:56,454
Are you here with your parents?

396
00:15:56,489 --> 00:15:58,289
- Yeah. And my nephew.

397
00:15:58,925 --> 00:16:00,825
- So where do you call home?

398
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:02,393
- Richmond, actually.

399
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:06,831
- I just came back about
a year ago from Boston.

400
00:16:09,903 --> 00:16:12,971
- Grace will find out about
the stores eventually, dear.

401
00:16:13,006 --> 00:16:15,606
- I just don't want to
worry her unnecessarily.

402
00:16:15,642 --> 00:16:18,176
I got us into this
mess, I can get us out.

403
00:16:18,211 --> 00:16:19,143
- Mm hm.

404
00:16:21,014 --> 00:16:21,913
- Hello.

405
00:16:23,984 --> 00:16:25,116
- Your wade...

406
00:16:26,019 --> 00:16:28,353
Of glowscapes by wade?

407
00:16:28,388 --> 00:16:29,854
- Wade Edwards,
pleased to meet you.

408
00:16:29,889 --> 00:16:33,324
- (laughs) I'm Wendy ryerson
head of the committee.

409
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,793
My husband and I can't
pass by one of your houses

410
00:16:35,829 --> 00:16:37,295
without stopping.

411
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:39,864
It's like 4th of
July in December.

412
00:16:41,201 --> 00:16:42,967
- I'm so glad it brings you joy.

413
00:16:44,237 --> 00:16:46,537
- We'll be reviewing
the applications and
the committee will

414
00:16:46,573 --> 00:16:49,407
reach out to the four
prelim qualifiers sometime

415
00:16:49,442 --> 00:16:51,309
in a day or so.

416
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:54,545
Be sure to keep your
ringer on. (laughs)

417
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:57,849
hi!

418
00:16:57,884 --> 00:16:59,584
- Hey.
- Hi.

419
00:16:59,619 --> 00:17:01,919
- Can't wait to see what
you Ryans have for us

420
00:17:01,955 --> 00:17:04,022
under your Santa caps this year.

421
00:17:04,057 --> 00:17:05,757
It's going to be pretty
stiff competition

422
00:17:05,792 --> 00:17:08,926
with glowscapes in
the mix. (laughs)

423
00:17:08,962 --> 00:17:11,696
- you're going to show
our work as always Wendy.

424
00:17:11,731 --> 00:17:13,598
- I don't know if you've
heard, but this year,

425
00:17:13,633 --> 00:17:16,234
in addition to the municipal
contract to decorate every

426
00:17:16,269 --> 00:17:19,670
public building at Ashland
falls next holiday season,

427
00:17:19,706 --> 00:17:22,774
cardinal group energy is
sponsoring a cash prize.

428
00:17:22,809 --> 00:17:23,941
- How much?

429
00:17:23,977 --> 00:17:25,910
- $50,000!

430
00:17:25,945 --> 00:17:27,512
- Whoa!
- You're kidding me?

431
00:17:27,547 --> 00:17:30,948
- Not a bad stocking
stuffer. Right? (laughs)

432
00:17:30,984 --> 00:17:31,949
well, good luck!

433
00:17:31,985 --> 00:17:33,885
- Well, thank you.

434
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:37,255
- You're going to need all
the luck you can get, bill,

435
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:40,358
because those tired
designs you're used to,

436
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:42,060
aren't going to
cut it this year.

437
00:17:42,095 --> 00:17:44,629
- Well I didn't see many of
your lawn signs out there

438
00:17:44,664 --> 00:17:46,264
this season, frank.

439
00:17:46,299 --> 00:17:48,900
Seems to me that
it's your designs

440
00:17:48,935 --> 00:17:51,202
that people are no longer
interested in these days.

441
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:52,870
- Okay, bill. That's enough.

442
00:17:52,906 --> 00:17:54,305
- Don't start, frank.

443
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:55,873
- There's nothing
to worry about.

444
00:17:55,909 --> 00:17:57,875
Probably won't even
finish his design,

445
00:17:58,745 --> 00:18:00,411
if he's chosen to compete.

446
00:18:00,447 --> 00:18:02,814
- Excuse me, I don't
remember you winning anything

447
00:18:02,849 --> 00:18:04,215
these last couple of years.

448
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,250
- Remind me when the
last time you won was.

449
00:18:06,286 --> 00:18:07,151
Can you remember?

450
00:18:07,187 --> 00:18:08,352
- [Wendy] gentlemen, please!

451
00:18:08,388 --> 00:18:10,455
- Well, I don't need an award
to feel good about myself,

452
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:11,989
like some people I know.

453
00:18:12,025 --> 00:18:14,325
- Oh, oh, you want to settle
this old fashioned way?

454
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,326
- Sure, I would like that.

455
00:18:15,361 --> 00:18:16,561
- Huh, you want that? Come on.

456
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:17,829
No. You heard what
he said to me.

457
00:18:17,864 --> 00:18:18,930
- Dad?
- Pop?

458
00:18:18,965 --> 00:18:22,633
(frank and bill bickering)

459
00:18:22,669 --> 00:18:23,668
- come on! Cut it out!

460
00:18:23,703 --> 00:18:24,836
What's going on?
What's going on?

461
00:18:24,871 --> 00:18:28,139
- Oh, just your father and
bill Ryan going at it again.

462
00:18:28,174 --> 00:18:29,407
- If you two don't knock it off,

463
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:32,610
the committee will disqualify
both of you from the contest.

464
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,746
- But this is
Christmas, gentlemen.

465
00:18:35,782 --> 00:18:37,849
This is the season of forgiving.

466
00:18:37,884 --> 00:18:40,451
- Bill, come on, come on.

467
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:46,524
- What if Dante sees you?

468
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:49,527
Do you want him to see his
Nono making a fool of himself

469
00:18:49,562 --> 00:18:51,496
in front of everyone
in the town?

470
00:19:04,711 --> 00:19:07,545
- No-no, who was that man
you were arguing with?

471
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:08,513
- Nobody.

472
00:19:08,548 --> 00:19:10,081
- Mm. They used to be friends.

473
00:19:10,116 --> 00:19:12,016
- Good friends,
once upon a time.

474
00:19:12,051 --> 00:19:15,286
- Started a holiday decorating
company in college together.

475
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:17,588
- Yeah and kept it going
after they graduated.

476
00:19:17,624 --> 00:19:19,690
They called it making
spirits bright,

477
00:19:19,726 --> 00:19:22,360
was a nice little business
for them during the holidays.

478
00:19:22,395 --> 00:19:24,428
- We even used to spend
Christmases together.

479
00:19:24,464 --> 00:19:26,230
- What happened then?

480
00:19:26,266 --> 00:19:27,431
- Well...

481
00:19:27,467 --> 00:19:30,234
He kept pestering me
to decorate faster

482
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:32,170
so we could get more clients.

483
00:19:33,273 --> 00:19:37,475
And all I really cared about
was doing the quality of work.

484
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:39,277
He cared about the money.

485
00:19:39,312 --> 00:19:41,979
So we got into an
argument and he kicked me

486
00:19:42,015 --> 00:19:43,047
out of the company.

487
00:19:43,082 --> 00:19:45,383
- Yes. I broke up the company.

488
00:19:45,418 --> 00:19:47,919
Because frank told
me that I was greedy,

489
00:19:48,755 --> 00:19:51,422
that I put quantity
over quality.

490
00:19:51,457 --> 00:19:53,424
Just because I wanted to
make a few extra dollars

491
00:19:53,459 --> 00:19:54,559
doing something we both loved,

492
00:19:54,594 --> 00:19:57,595
doesn't make my reasons for
doing it any less noble.

493
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:59,797
- They were a great partnership.

494
00:19:59,832 --> 00:20:01,966
- We brought out the
best of each other...

495
00:20:03,469 --> 00:20:04,735
For a time.

496
00:20:04,771 --> 00:20:06,237
You know, he would
draw up the designs

497
00:20:06,272 --> 00:20:09,106
and I'd put a plan
together and execute them.

498
00:20:09,142 --> 00:20:11,475
But when he insulted
me, that was it.

499
00:20:11,511 --> 00:20:12,944
That was the end of our business

500
00:20:12,979 --> 00:20:15,112
and the end of our friendship.

501
00:20:15,148 --> 00:20:17,949
- And that's when grandpa
opened up the furniture store

502
00:20:17,984 --> 00:20:20,685
and turned making spirits
bright into deck the halls.

503
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,787
- Can't you just
apologize and make up?

504
00:20:22,822 --> 00:20:24,322
You two were so close.

505
00:20:24,357 --> 00:20:27,091
- Apologize to him
after what he said?

506
00:20:27,126 --> 00:20:28,859
He should be apologizing to me.

507
00:20:28,895 --> 00:20:31,028
- It's a shame what
happened between you two

508
00:20:31,064 --> 00:20:32,630
is all I'm saying.

509
00:20:32,665 --> 00:20:34,165
- No, the only shame here is
that frank was never admit

510
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,766
he was wrong.

511
00:20:35,802 --> 00:20:36,734
Now come on.

512
00:20:39,639 --> 00:20:42,306
(grace sighs)

513
00:20:42,342 --> 00:20:45,276
- dad, I am going to
take Dante to school.

514
00:20:45,311 --> 00:20:46,110
- Give him a kiss for me.

515
00:20:46,145 --> 00:20:46,944
- I will.

516
00:20:49,015 --> 00:20:50,448
- Have a good day.
- You too.

517
00:20:53,086 --> 00:20:54,619
- Hey dad.

518
00:20:54,654 --> 00:20:55,786
I'm not going to
be able to help out

519
00:20:55,822 --> 00:20:58,556
with good tidings tonight
'cause I got a shift at the bar.

520
00:20:58,591 --> 00:21:00,057
- Well that's all right.

521
00:21:00,093 --> 00:21:01,859
We don't have any
customers anyway.

522
00:21:04,163 --> 00:21:07,898
Listen, I know it's
not your dream job,

523
00:21:07,934 --> 00:21:09,967
but if you ever want to learn
the contracting business

524
00:21:10,003 --> 00:21:13,204
from your old man, my
door is always open.

525
00:21:15,074 --> 00:21:16,841
- I will think about it.

526
00:21:18,444 --> 00:21:19,510
Thanks pop..

527
00:21:27,353 --> 00:21:29,420
- Remember making this?

528
00:21:29,455 --> 00:21:30,354
- No way.

529
00:21:31,858 --> 00:21:33,824
- You made it at
the Ryan's house.

530
00:21:35,028 --> 00:21:37,194
Such good memories
of those times.

531
00:21:38,064 --> 00:21:40,097
You saw Arlene Ryan's
grandson, right?

532
00:21:40,133 --> 00:21:41,098
- Yeah.

533
00:21:41,134 --> 00:21:42,233
- He's the same age as Dante.

534
00:21:42,268 --> 00:21:43,134
- Really?

535
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:45,903
- It's a shame they
don't know each other.

536
00:21:46,973 --> 00:21:50,174
Oh, remember who made this one?

537
00:21:50,209 --> 00:21:51,609
- Maria?

538
00:21:51,644 --> 00:21:52,543
- Grace.

539
00:21:53,646 --> 00:21:55,513
That'll be nice to have one
from the others on our trees.

540
00:21:55,548 --> 00:21:58,616
They have an ornament that maria
made, found it in this box.

541
00:21:58,651 --> 00:22:00,318
It's been mislabeled.

542
00:22:01,421 --> 00:22:04,455
I think I will sneak this
around the back of the tree,

543
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:06,390
so your father
doesn't make a stink.

544
00:22:06,426 --> 00:22:07,325
- Good idea.

545
00:22:08,328 --> 00:22:09,627
- Que Bella, huh?.

546
00:22:09,662 --> 00:22:10,761
- Yes. Nice.

547
00:22:10,797 --> 00:22:12,196
- I meant grace.

548
00:22:12,231 --> 00:22:13,097
- Mom.

549
00:22:13,132 --> 00:22:15,533
- Oh, she's turned
into a beautiful woman.

550
00:22:15,568 --> 00:22:16,367
- Ma.

551
00:22:16,402 --> 00:22:17,234
- Okay.

552
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:18,369
Okay. Okay. I'll stop.

553
00:22:18,404 --> 00:22:20,071
- All right. I gotta go.

554
00:22:20,106 --> 00:22:22,139
I'll see you later.
I love you, okay?

555
00:22:22,175 --> 00:22:23,541
Ciao, mom.
- Ciao.

556
00:22:29,415 --> 00:22:31,215
- Your father works fast.

557
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:32,583
- I know. He's a machine.

558
00:22:32,618 --> 00:22:33,751
Okay.

559
00:22:33,786 --> 00:22:34,685
Red or green?

560
00:22:35,922 --> 00:22:37,221
- They're both nice.

561
00:22:37,256 --> 00:22:39,156
- What color will be
good in the windows?

562
00:22:39,192 --> 00:22:41,659
- Either. They're
just wreaths, honey.

563
00:22:41,694 --> 00:22:43,427
There's no wrong choice.

564
00:22:43,463 --> 00:22:45,496
- Been having trouble
parsing good taste from bad

565
00:22:45,531 --> 00:22:46,430
these days.

566
00:22:48,301 --> 00:22:50,468
- [bill] you guys
gabbing or working?

567
00:22:50,503 --> 00:22:52,737
- Remind me how much
you're paying us again.

568
00:22:52,772 --> 00:22:54,572
- You want to be paid? Huh.

569
00:22:55,842 --> 00:22:57,274
The nerve.

570
00:22:57,310 --> 00:22:59,276
My love and affection
should be more than enough.

571
00:22:59,979 --> 00:23:04,215
("deck the halls" instrumental)

572
00:23:09,355 --> 00:23:10,688
- good crowd tonight.

573
00:23:10,723 --> 00:23:12,089
- Yeah, nothing gets
people out to the bar

574
00:23:12,125 --> 00:23:14,158
like extended time
with their families.

575
00:23:15,728 --> 00:23:17,695
Ya know, there might
even be some single women

576
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:20,197
out here tonight that's
looking to meet a nice guy.

577
00:23:20,233 --> 00:23:21,432
Keep your eyes peeled.

578
00:23:21,467 --> 00:23:23,534
- Sure, sure.

579
00:23:23,569 --> 00:23:25,836
- Hey, what about Lisa?

580
00:23:25,872 --> 00:23:28,539
I heard her say you
weren't unattractive.

581
00:23:28,574 --> 00:23:30,474
- Nothing says interested
like a double negative.

582
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:32,777
(laughing)

583
00:23:34,647 --> 00:23:36,213
- this seat taken?

584
00:23:36,249 --> 00:23:38,682
- Well, it's not, not taken.

585
00:23:39,385 --> 00:23:41,152
- So someone is sitting here?

586
00:23:41,187 --> 00:23:43,187
- No, it's all yours, grace.

587
00:23:43,222 --> 00:23:44,955
- Oh, you two know each other?

588
00:23:44,991 --> 00:23:48,192
- Yeah, childhood
friends and what now...

589
00:23:48,227 --> 00:23:50,895
Decades old family feud.

590
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:53,831
- Well, in that case,
drinks on the house.

591
00:23:53,866 --> 00:23:55,366
Keep the peace between you two.

592
00:23:55,401 --> 00:23:57,201
- Manhattan up. Thanks.

593
00:23:58,171 --> 00:24:00,638
- So what brings you in tonight?

594
00:24:00,673 --> 00:24:02,039
- Oh, I had to get
out of the house.

595
00:24:02,074 --> 00:24:04,508
I mean, it's pacing
a hole in the floor

596
00:24:04,544 --> 00:24:05,643
waiting to hear
about bright night.

597
00:24:05,678 --> 00:24:08,646
- Yeah, mine's probably wearing
out the carpet right now

598
00:24:08,681 --> 00:24:09,613
as we speak.

599
00:24:11,584 --> 00:24:13,083
- Thank you.

600
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:13,984
Oh.

601
00:24:15,855 --> 00:24:16,720
Mm.

602
00:24:17,356 --> 00:24:19,490
Well that's not, not delicious.

603
00:24:19,525 --> 00:24:21,659
- See, that's how you do it.

604
00:24:21,694 --> 00:24:24,395
- Whatever. You take your 10.
I'll let you two catch up.

605
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:26,564
And you let me
know anything else.

606
00:24:30,636 --> 00:24:31,969
- Been working here long?

607
00:24:33,005 --> 00:24:35,005
- No, he just throws me
shifts every once in a while,

608
00:24:35,041 --> 00:24:36,774
when it's really busy.

609
00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:39,443
Truth be told anything
more than a vodka soda

610
00:24:39,479 --> 00:24:41,078
and I am way out of my depth.

611
00:24:42,215 --> 00:24:43,380
- (laughs) well, I'm glad
he's making my drink then.

612
00:24:43,416 --> 00:24:44,782
- [tony] yeah.

613
00:24:44,817 --> 00:24:46,550
Seems like a good friend.

614
00:24:46,586 --> 00:24:48,919
- Yes. Yeah, he's a good guy.

615
00:24:48,955 --> 00:24:51,288
We played hockey together
at bishop O’Connell.

616
00:24:51,324 --> 00:24:54,925
- And you got a hockey
scholarship to that fancy school

617
00:24:54,961 --> 00:24:56,694
in Arlington, right?

618
00:24:56,729 --> 00:24:59,463
Yeah, probably why we
never ran into each other.

619
00:24:59,499 --> 00:25:01,765
- Are you keeping tabs on me?

620
00:25:01,801 --> 00:25:03,601
- One hears things.

621
00:25:03,636 --> 00:25:04,535
- Okay.

622
00:25:04,570 --> 00:25:06,270
Well you heard right.

623
00:25:06,305 --> 00:25:09,607
After Arlington, I played
hockey at Boston university,

624
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:13,477
but I blew out my
knee sophomore year

625
00:25:13,513 --> 00:25:16,747
and that was kind of the
end of my hockey career.

626
00:25:16,782 --> 00:25:17,748
- That must've been hard.

627
00:25:17,783 --> 00:25:18,716
- Yeah, it was.

628
00:25:18,751 --> 00:25:21,285
But it was also kind of
a blessing in disguise

629
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:25,422
because it made me focus on
school, for like the first time.

630
00:25:25,458 --> 00:25:26,590
I got my MBA.

631
00:25:26,626 --> 00:25:28,425
- And what brought
you back home?

632
00:25:28,461 --> 00:25:31,428
- I was working for
this marketing company.

633
00:25:31,464 --> 00:25:34,498
I took a big swing
on this campaign,

634
00:25:34,534 --> 00:25:38,002
missed completely,
landed flat on my face,

635
00:25:38,037 --> 00:25:40,070
got canned and then I
moved back here last year

636
00:25:40,106 --> 00:25:42,339
with my tail between my legs.

637
00:25:42,375 --> 00:25:44,475
- Well, there's something
to be said about going

638
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:45,409
with your instincts,

639
00:25:45,444 --> 00:25:47,578
you know, just putting
it all out there.

640
00:25:47,613 --> 00:25:48,779
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

641
00:25:48,814 --> 00:25:49,780
- Don't.

642
00:25:49,815 --> 00:25:52,483
(laughing)

643
00:25:52,518 --> 00:25:54,952
so what about you? What
have you been up to?

644
00:25:54,987 --> 00:25:56,754
- My college roommate
and I started

645
00:25:56,789 --> 00:25:59,089
a home staging business.

646
00:25:59,125 --> 00:26:01,926
"at upstaged, we're the
last stage you will need

647
00:26:01,961 --> 00:26:05,763
before selling your
home." (laughs)

648
00:26:05,798 --> 00:26:06,764
- catchy.

649
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:08,432
- Did you like that?

650
00:26:08,467 --> 00:26:10,868
It was actually Sarah,
my business partner,

651
00:26:10,903 --> 00:26:11,802
who came up with it.

652
00:26:11,837 --> 00:26:15,306
She's the show-woman,
charmed for days.

653
00:26:15,341 --> 00:26:16,674
- And what, what's your role?

654
00:26:16,709 --> 00:26:19,510
Are you the creative
genius behind the curtain?

655
00:26:19,545 --> 00:26:20,711
- Oh, boy.

656
00:26:20,746 --> 00:26:25,549
Truth be told, I'm feeling
about as confident these days

657
00:26:25,585 --> 00:26:28,686
as you making a slow-gin fizz.

658
00:26:28,721 --> 00:26:30,054
- I don't even
know what that is.

659
00:26:30,089 --> 00:26:31,055
- You don't know what that is?

660
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:32,790
- No. Does it mean you
make it really slowly?

661
00:26:32,825 --> 00:26:35,359
- Hey you two, a table
just opened up in the back.

662
00:26:35,394 --> 00:26:37,027
It's a little quieter.

663
00:26:37,063 --> 00:26:38,662
- Don't you need
me to work though?

664
00:26:38,698 --> 00:26:40,965
- Well, I haven't had to
remake any drinks tonight,

665
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,233
so the two of you chatting
is actually saving me money.

666
00:26:43,269 --> 00:26:45,302
- Wow. (laughing)

667
00:26:45,338 --> 00:26:46,203
- thanks.

668
00:26:52,912 --> 00:26:53,877
- You like that?

669
00:26:55,281 --> 00:26:56,647
That's my mom.

670
00:26:57,617 --> 00:27:00,017
We officially made it
into bright nights.

671
00:27:00,052 --> 00:27:01,352
- Congratulations.

672
00:27:01,387 --> 00:27:04,121
(phone buzzing)

673
00:27:06,592 --> 00:27:07,491
so did we.

674
00:27:08,628 --> 00:27:12,663
- Well, guess this feud isn't
going away anytime soon,

675
00:27:12,698 --> 00:27:13,864
is it?

676
00:27:13,899 --> 00:27:14,798
- I guess not.

677
00:27:15,968 --> 00:27:16,867
- Game on.

678
00:27:25,144 --> 00:27:27,811
- Congratulations to
each of our four teams,

679
00:27:27,847 --> 00:27:30,948
deck the halls, good
tidings, glowscapes,

680
00:27:30,983 --> 00:27:34,718
and our last year's
winner, mistletoe design.

681
00:27:34,754 --> 00:27:36,654
Each of you will be
randomly assigned

682
00:27:36,689 --> 00:27:38,756
one of these lovely
homes around us.

683
00:27:38,791 --> 00:27:42,426
And you'll have three days
to transform your deck house

684
00:27:42,461 --> 00:27:45,829
as thoroughly as your
imagination allows.

685
00:27:45,865 --> 00:27:48,966
And any house that is
not completed by 6:00 pm

686
00:27:49,001 --> 00:27:53,070
on the 21st will be disqualified
from the competition.

687
00:27:53,105 --> 00:27:56,573
Though I've been assured that
won't be an issue this year.

688
00:27:56,609 --> 00:27:59,410
Our three person committee
will judge each deck house

689
00:27:59,445 --> 00:28:02,579
on creativity,
technical achievement,

690
00:28:02,615 --> 00:28:04,515
and most importantly,

691
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:08,485
the ooh and the ah factor.

692
00:28:08,521 --> 00:28:11,355
Who will then select two
finalists to go head to head

693
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:12,923
for the grand prize.

694
00:28:12,958 --> 00:28:17,261
A contract from the town of
Ashland falls worth $25,000

695
00:28:19,665 --> 00:28:23,300
to decorate every municipal
building next holiday season.

696
00:28:23,335 --> 00:28:26,303
And this year cardinal
group energy is sponsoring

697
00:28:26,338 --> 00:28:29,473
an additional $50,000
prize to the winner!

698
00:28:30,242 --> 00:28:33,243
(crowd applauding)

699
00:28:36,248 --> 00:28:39,983
- hi, just wanted to
come introduce myself.

700
00:28:40,019 --> 00:28:41,151
Wade Edwards.

701
00:28:41,187 --> 00:28:42,219
- Bill Ryan.
- Hi.

702
00:28:42,254 --> 00:28:43,187
- Nice to meet you.

703
00:28:43,222 --> 00:28:44,154
This is my daughter, grace.

704
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:44,955
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

705
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:45,556
- And my wife, Arlene.

706
00:28:45,591 --> 00:28:47,124
- Oh, hi.

707
00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:49,293
- So I've seen
your work, it's...

708
00:28:50,329 --> 00:28:51,729
Colorful,

709
00:28:51,764 --> 00:28:52,796
different.

710
00:28:52,832 --> 00:28:54,198
- Yeah, I think that's
why people are responding

711
00:28:54,233 --> 00:28:55,499
the way they are.

712
00:28:55,534 --> 00:28:57,534
Hired two new crews to
keep up with demand.

713
00:28:58,637 --> 00:28:59,737
I'm sure you knew what that
was like back when you were

714
00:28:59,772 --> 00:29:01,004
at the top of your game.

715
00:29:02,174 --> 00:29:05,342
- I like to think I'm still
at the top of my game, wade.

716
00:29:05,377 --> 00:29:08,712
- Right, yeah, been five
years since you last one?

717
00:29:08,748 --> 00:29:10,647
- Six, but who's counting?

718
00:29:10,683 --> 00:29:14,017
- Well every year's a chance
turn it all around. Right?

719
00:29:14,053 --> 00:29:15,252
Anyway.

720
00:29:15,287 --> 00:29:16,653
Good luck.

721
00:29:16,689 --> 00:29:17,554
- You too.

722
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:23,660
- Your deck house will be
that one right over there.

723
00:29:23,696 --> 00:29:24,995
- Oh great.

724
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:25,929
- We can work with that.

725
00:29:25,965 --> 00:29:26,764
- All right.

726
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:27,765
- Yeah, good.

727
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:30,033
- And yours will be next
to deck the halls, okay?

728
00:29:31,203 --> 00:29:32,069
- Okay.

729
00:29:33,973 --> 00:29:35,105
- Right.

730
00:29:35,141 --> 00:29:36,173
So we'll take a
bunch of photographs

731
00:29:36,208 --> 00:29:37,541
and then I'll go
back to the shop

732
00:29:37,576 --> 00:29:38,842
and start plotting the design.

733
00:29:38,878 --> 00:29:40,077
- Right.

734
00:29:40,112 --> 00:29:41,345
- A lot riding on
things this year,

735
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:42,780
so we can't waste
a single moment.

736
00:29:42,815 --> 00:29:43,747
- Yeah.

737
00:29:43,783 --> 00:29:44,915
- [grace] what was that dad?

738
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:46,550
- Oh, I was just telling
your mother that second place

739
00:29:46,585 --> 00:29:47,785
won't cut it this year.

740
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:50,521
- Ah, right, because second
place is just the first loser.

741
00:29:50,556 --> 00:29:51,855
Yeah.
- Exactly right.

742
00:29:51,891 --> 00:29:53,123
Anyway. Come on.

743
00:29:53,159 --> 00:29:54,591
- You always give the
best pep talks, dad.

744
00:29:54,627 --> 00:29:55,526
(laughing)

745
00:29:55,561 --> 00:29:56,426
- come on.
- Yep.

746
00:29:57,663 --> 00:30:00,531
(cheerful music)

747
00:30:08,007 --> 00:30:09,306
- what about this color scheme?

748
00:30:09,341 --> 00:30:11,074
You think that would work again?

749
00:30:13,946 --> 00:30:15,813
Just dad's really
in the zone, huh?

750
00:30:15,848 --> 00:30:17,581
- And he wants to make a
strong showing after being

751
00:30:17,616 --> 00:30:19,683
out of the competition
for so long.

752
00:30:22,588 --> 00:30:24,154
- You want some hot chocolate?

753
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:26,056
- Yes, sure. Fuel for the fire.

754
00:30:26,091 --> 00:30:26,957
- Yes, please.

755
00:30:35,467 --> 00:30:37,100
- Do you want something?

756
00:30:37,136 --> 00:30:39,269
- Oh yes. I'll take a
hot chocolate please.

757
00:30:39,305 --> 00:30:40,571
It's been an hour
since I had some,

758
00:30:40,606 --> 00:30:42,272
my body's going
through withdrawal.

759
00:30:42,308 --> 00:30:43,640
(laughing)

760
00:30:43,676 --> 00:30:44,641
- thank you.

761
00:30:44,677 --> 00:30:48,011
- And here, let me get
that for you. Thank you.

762
00:30:48,047 --> 00:30:50,180
And two more, please.
Keep the change.

763
00:30:50,216 --> 00:30:51,782
- You don't have-

764
00:30:51,817 --> 00:30:53,083
- after the pizzelles and
the free drinks last night,

765
00:30:53,118 --> 00:30:54,818
it's the least I can do.

766
00:30:55,955 --> 00:30:57,955
- Ah, thank you.
I appreciate that.

767
00:30:57,990 --> 00:30:59,923
I'm glad we ran into each other.

768
00:30:59,959 --> 00:31:02,526
I wanted to tell you what a
nice time I had last night.

769
00:31:02,561 --> 00:31:03,794
- Me too.

770
00:31:03,829 --> 00:31:07,531
I can't remember the last time
I stayed out until last call.

771
00:31:07,566 --> 00:31:09,366
- Well, I definitely prefer
doing it on that side

772
00:31:09,401 --> 00:31:10,834
of the bar, that's for sure.

773
00:31:11,871 --> 00:31:13,604
- Are you sure pat wasn't upset?

774
00:31:13,639 --> 00:31:15,305
- Oh yeah, he's fine.

775
00:31:15,341 --> 00:31:18,141
I think he's just happy to
see me having a good time.

776
00:31:18,978 --> 00:31:20,244
- Is that so rare?

777
00:31:21,413 --> 00:31:24,982
- Not as frequent as
I'd like it to be,

778
00:31:25,017 --> 00:31:29,152
but bumping into you around
town definitely helps.

779
00:31:30,489 --> 00:31:32,522
Are you just out
enjoying the calm

780
00:31:32,558 --> 00:31:33,957
before the bright night's storm.

781
00:31:33,993 --> 00:31:35,459
- Ah, yeah.

782
00:31:35,494 --> 00:31:36,994
My mom and I are taking
out my nephew just before

783
00:31:37,029 --> 00:31:38,128
we start helping dad.

784
00:31:39,365 --> 00:31:43,867
And your dad, is he working on
his sketches for the contest?

785
00:31:43,903 --> 00:31:46,136
- Oh, yeah. He's deep in it.

786
00:31:46,171 --> 00:31:47,871
You know, your father
better watch out,

787
00:31:47,907 --> 00:31:50,407
substituting candy
canes for snowflakes

788
00:31:50,442 --> 00:31:51,575
ain't going to cut it this year.

789
00:31:51,610 --> 00:31:55,178
- Yeah. Well, I think he's
got a few tricks in his bag.

790
00:31:55,214 --> 00:31:56,146
- Sure.

791
00:31:56,181 --> 00:31:57,281
But I mean, you have to admit,

792
00:31:57,316 --> 00:31:59,249
his designs are kind of looking
the same the last couple

793
00:31:59,285 --> 00:32:00,384
of years, so.

794
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:02,552
- Oh, maybe your dad should
spend less time dreaming

795
00:32:02,588 --> 00:32:05,022
up his designs and more
time executing them.

796
00:32:06,792 --> 00:32:08,392
- Yeah. Maybe.

797
00:32:10,596 --> 00:32:12,796
Well, thank you for
the hot chocolate.

798
00:32:15,367 --> 00:32:17,401
I guess this makes
us square now.

799
00:32:17,436 --> 00:32:19,202
- Yeah, I guess it does.

800
00:32:20,973 --> 00:32:22,039
- I'll see you later.

801
00:32:25,644 --> 00:32:26,910
- Oh, thank you, honey.

802
00:32:26,946 --> 00:32:27,878
- Thank you.

803
00:32:32,952 --> 00:32:35,218
- Don't you think that's
a little ambitious?

804
00:32:36,588 --> 00:32:39,389
Maybe we should save
that for the finals,

805
00:32:40,459 --> 00:32:42,759
go with something a little
simpler for the prelims?

806
00:32:44,163 --> 00:32:46,229
- Well, we have to
make it to the finals.

807
00:32:52,905 --> 00:32:54,604
- [bill] something's
missing, isn't there?

808
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,139
- The only thing
that's not in there

809
00:32:56,175 --> 00:32:58,809
is a complete re-creation
of Santa's workshop.

810
00:32:58,844 --> 00:33:01,578
Keep in mind, we don't want
the deck house to collapse.

811
00:33:01,613 --> 00:33:03,480
- It's got to sing, grace.

812
00:33:03,515 --> 00:33:05,282
I mean the committee has to
have its collective breath

813
00:33:05,317 --> 00:33:06,583
taken away.

814
00:33:06,618 --> 00:33:07,784
- Yes, I know. And
you will get there.

815
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:10,320
I just think that
you're possibly
overstuffing the designs

816
00:33:10,356 --> 00:33:12,055
in hopes that bigger
equals better.

817
00:33:12,091 --> 00:33:14,958
- Yeah, but you've always
been able to spin my ideas

818
00:33:14,994 --> 00:33:17,627
into gold, so come
on, spin away.

819
00:33:17,663 --> 00:33:19,162
- I think once
you start editing,

820
00:33:19,198 --> 00:33:20,964
you'll find the story
you want to tell.

821
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:21,965
- Yeah, right,

822
00:33:22,001 --> 00:33:23,266
- bill.
- Hm?

823
00:33:23,302 --> 00:33:25,035
- It's Alonzo, said
it was important.

824
00:33:27,506 --> 00:33:28,739
- (sighs) okay.
I'll be right back.

825
00:33:28,774 --> 00:33:29,639
- Yep.

826
00:33:30,642 --> 00:33:33,777
Is it me or does he seem
more stressed this year?

827
00:33:33,812 --> 00:33:35,345
- Oh.

828
00:33:35,381 --> 00:33:37,481
I think frank Scotto
being in the contest again

829
00:33:37,516 --> 00:33:38,515
is making him anxious.

830
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:39,483
- Right.

831
00:33:39,518 --> 00:33:40,250
- You did not hear that from me.

832
00:33:40,285 --> 00:33:41,752
(phone ringing)

833
00:33:41,787 --> 00:33:43,720
- oh, it's Sarah.
I should take this.

834
00:33:44,556 --> 00:33:45,422
Sorry.

835
00:33:47,292 --> 00:33:48,525
Hey.

836
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:49,793
- [Sarah] how goes
it go it, lady?

837
00:33:49,828 --> 00:33:51,094
- Uh, fine.

838
00:33:52,231 --> 00:33:54,131
- Try to contain
your excitement.

839
00:33:55,234 --> 00:33:58,468
- Yeah. I'm helping dad
with the competition again.

840
00:33:58,504 --> 00:33:59,936
- Pulled you in again, huh?

841
00:33:59,972 --> 00:34:00,971
- Neck deep.

842
00:34:01,974 --> 00:34:03,473
- The reason I called was,

843
00:34:03,509 --> 00:34:05,675
the producers invited us to
their annual holiday party

844
00:34:05,711 --> 00:34:08,311
at the whisper in Carytown.

845
00:34:08,347 --> 00:34:09,212
- Uh, sorry.

846
00:34:09,248 --> 00:34:10,614
Sorry, what day?

847
00:34:10,649 --> 00:34:11,782
- 21st.

848
00:34:11,817 --> 00:34:14,885
- Yeah, sure. I'll be there.

849
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:17,154
Do you think that they'll want
us to talk about our ideas

850
00:34:17,189 --> 00:34:18,121
for the show?

851
00:34:18,157 --> 00:34:19,356
Should we prepare something?

852
00:34:19,391 --> 00:34:20,824
- It's a party.

853
00:34:20,859 --> 00:34:22,726
Can't imagine they'd
want to discuss business.

854
00:34:22,761 --> 00:34:23,994
- Right?

855
00:34:24,029 --> 00:34:24,661
- [Sarah] see you
there. All right?

856
00:34:24,696 --> 00:34:25,462
- See you there.

857
00:34:28,067 --> 00:34:29,666
Everything okay, dad?

858
00:34:29,701 --> 00:34:31,168
- Yeah, it's all good.

859
00:34:32,104 --> 00:34:34,337
Let's just get back to it, okay?

860
00:34:34,373 --> 00:34:35,205
- Yeah.

861
00:34:42,548 --> 00:34:45,582
- Hey, ma. When's that
lasagna going to be ready?

862
00:34:45,617 --> 00:34:47,384
- Don't rush the artista.

863
00:34:50,122 --> 00:34:52,956
(fans cheering on tv)

864
00:34:52,991 --> 00:34:56,093
- how do they get the puck
into the air like that?

865
00:34:56,128 --> 00:35:00,197
- They practice and then
they practice some more,

866
00:35:00,232 --> 00:35:01,865
but there are some
tricks you can learn.

867
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:03,567
Juggling is a good
place to start.

868
00:35:03,602 --> 00:35:05,936
- Juggling? No way, uncle t.

869
00:35:05,971 --> 00:35:08,872
- It's good for the
hand-eye coordination.

870
00:35:08,907 --> 00:35:12,209
- Your uncle used to
practice every night.

871
00:35:12,244 --> 00:35:14,778
He always pushed himself
to try to be the best.

872
00:35:15,914 --> 00:35:18,215
Even when things
seemed impossible,

873
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:20,350
he always pushed through.

874
00:35:21,353 --> 00:35:22,719
There was no quit in him.

875
00:35:25,257 --> 00:35:29,326
- I should get going. Pat needs
me down at the bar tonight.

876
00:35:29,361 --> 00:35:30,260
Juggle.

877
00:35:33,098 --> 00:35:34,998
- I think I'm going to
learn how to juggle.

878
00:35:35,033 --> 00:35:36,032
- Me, too.

879
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:54,684
- [news man] at Ashland
falls as the 15th annual

880
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:55,986
bright nights competition.

881
00:35:56,021 --> 00:35:56,953
- Hey.
- Hey.

882
00:35:58,123 --> 00:35:59,256
- Where's your mother?

883
00:35:59,291 --> 00:36:01,358
- She took Evan sledding. She'll
meet us at the deck house.

884
00:36:01,393 --> 00:36:02,592
- Oh, okay.

885
00:36:02,628 --> 00:36:03,860
- Glowscapes.

886
00:36:03,896 --> 00:36:05,495
The holiday displays
that have been the talk

887
00:36:05,531 --> 00:36:09,266
of Ashland falls this season
are the work of wade Edwards.

888
00:36:09,301 --> 00:36:10,534
Tell us more wade.

889
00:36:10,569 --> 00:36:12,269
- Families have been
stringing up lights,

890
00:36:12,304 --> 00:36:14,371
putting a snowman on a lawn
and lining their walkways

891
00:36:14,406 --> 00:36:17,440
with candy canes
since, well, forever.

892
00:36:17,476 --> 00:36:20,544
With glowscapes, I wanted to
show there was another way,

893
00:36:20,579 --> 00:36:23,180
a better way to decorate
your home for the holidays.

894
00:36:23,215 --> 00:36:26,950
- An Alexandria native, wade
first saw the led technology

895
00:36:26,985 --> 00:36:31,054
he adopted online and
knew it was the future.

896
00:36:31,089 --> 00:36:33,490
- How does he swing
publicity like this?

897
00:36:33,525 --> 00:36:35,692
- Maybe glowscapes
is just that popular.

898
00:36:35,727 --> 00:36:38,295
I mean, people are lining
up just to catch a glimpse.

899
00:36:38,330 --> 00:36:40,630
- Wade Edwards and
glowscapes aim to do

900
00:36:40,666 --> 00:36:42,465
to the holiday decorating space,

901
00:36:42,501 --> 00:36:45,235
what streaming did
for the video store.

902
00:36:45,270 --> 00:36:48,705
With the crowds flocking to
get a gander at his creations,

903
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:51,107
the future of glowscapes
looks bright indeed.

904
00:36:52,578 --> 00:36:54,211
- All right, well,
let's get to work.

905
00:36:54,246 --> 00:36:55,345
We got a lot to do.

906
00:36:57,516 --> 00:36:58,682
- I still don't get how he
gets publicity like that.

907
00:36:58,717 --> 00:37:03,687
- And remember you have three
days to complete your deck

908
00:37:05,023 --> 00:37:07,691
house and to give
everyone equal time,

909
00:37:07,726 --> 00:37:11,061
each team begins
work at 9:00 am,

910
00:37:11,096 --> 00:37:14,831
but it's staple guns
down at exactly 6:00 pm.

911
00:37:14,866 --> 00:37:17,267
You may test your design
once it gets dark,

912
00:37:17,302 --> 00:37:20,837
but no work can be
completed after six.

913
00:37:20,872 --> 00:37:24,407
And you may start
your sleighs...

914
00:37:24,443 --> 00:37:26,176
Now!

915
00:37:26,211 --> 00:37:27,577
- Okay.

916
00:37:27,613 --> 00:37:29,512
I think I've come up
with a simpler design,

917
00:37:29,548 --> 00:37:32,115
something a little
bit more practical.

918
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:34,517
- I need two cross beams,
one light going this way,

919
00:37:34,553 --> 00:37:36,886
one light going this way
and it's doing a dance,

920
00:37:36,922 --> 00:37:38,188
it's doing a dance.

921
00:37:38,223 --> 00:37:39,422
- I've got it right here!

922
00:37:39,458 --> 00:37:40,724
- Get the landscape
out of the way.

923
00:37:40,759 --> 00:37:41,558
This bush has to go.
That bush has to go.

924
00:37:41,593 --> 00:37:43,360
These bushes have to go.

925
00:37:43,395 --> 00:37:44,194
- Don't forget to have fun.

926
00:37:44,229 --> 00:37:45,895
- Yeah. No problem.

927
00:37:49,501 --> 00:37:51,401
- By the way. Who's Alonzo?

928
00:37:52,671 --> 00:37:53,770
- What?

929
00:37:53,805 --> 00:37:56,239
- Whoever dad was talking
to on the call yesterday,

930
00:37:56,275 --> 00:37:59,142
it seemed serious, his
whole demeanor changed.

931
00:37:59,177 --> 00:38:02,412
- He's the manager at
our store in midlothian.

932
00:38:02,447 --> 00:38:03,346
- Is everything, okay?

933
00:38:03,382 --> 00:38:05,715
- Things are a little
slower than usual.

934
00:38:06,618 --> 00:38:08,451
- I overheard a customer
tell dad that he thought

935
00:38:08,487 --> 00:38:09,719
the store was closing.

936
00:38:11,490 --> 00:38:15,425
Mom, if there's something
up I want to try and help.

937
00:38:18,196 --> 00:38:20,297
- The expansion last year
hasn't gone as well as

938
00:38:20,332 --> 00:38:21,598
we would have hoped.

939
00:38:21,633 --> 00:38:24,934
- Ah. Well, how not
well are we talking?

940
00:38:24,970 --> 00:38:27,971
- Your father's sales
projections were a little off.

941
00:38:28,006 --> 00:38:30,140
With the lease on
the new building

942
00:38:30,175 --> 00:38:32,842
and inventory costs doubling,

943
00:38:32,878 --> 00:38:35,812
the stores are operating
at a loss right now.

944
00:38:35,847 --> 00:38:37,080
You know your father,

945
00:38:37,115 --> 00:38:39,983
he's always pushing
for bigger, better.

946
00:38:40,018 --> 00:38:42,519
And this time he may
have gone too big.

947
00:38:42,554 --> 00:38:44,020
- Why didn't you
tell me any of this?

948
00:38:44,056 --> 00:38:45,755
- He thought we
could work it out

949
00:38:46,792 --> 00:38:49,659
and you would have dropped
everything to help.

950
00:38:49,695 --> 00:38:52,662
- Yeah, but that decision should
have been up to me to make.

951
00:38:52,698 --> 00:38:54,130
- Well now you know.

952
00:38:55,233 --> 00:38:58,868
So if he seems more amped about
the competition this year,

953
00:38:58,904 --> 00:39:01,805
it's because that extra
50,000 would go a long way.

954
00:39:03,141 --> 00:39:04,074
- Yeah.

955
00:39:07,979 --> 00:39:10,113
- Maria, why don't you start
with putting the lights

956
00:39:10,148 --> 00:39:11,781
on the Christmas trees?

957
00:39:11,817 --> 00:39:13,850
Anthony and I, we will
start on the roof.

958
00:39:13,885 --> 00:39:14,984
- Okay.
- Okay.

959
00:39:18,323 --> 00:39:22,025
- Tony, stop eyeballing
the competition.

960
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:23,693
No matter how attractive she is.

961
00:39:25,497 --> 00:39:26,863
- Whatever.
- Come on.

962
00:39:32,371 --> 00:39:36,706
("oh, Christmas
tree" instrumental)

963
00:39:42,948 --> 00:39:44,647
- three, two, one.

964
00:39:44,683 --> 00:39:46,649
Everybody's stop for the day!

965
00:39:46,685 --> 00:39:47,917
Hands up! Up, up!

966
00:39:47,953 --> 00:39:49,386
Okay? Over there?

967
00:39:53,191 --> 00:39:57,060
("silent night" instrumental)

968
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,533
- you okay?

969
00:40:03,568 --> 00:40:05,001
- Yeah.

970
00:40:05,036 --> 00:40:07,270
I'm looking at these box
of ornaments that I found

971
00:40:07,305 --> 00:40:08,671
behind the couch.

972
00:40:09,775 --> 00:40:11,775
- The ones the Ryans made
that mom tried to hide?

973
00:40:11,810 --> 00:40:14,978
- She thinks she's
sly, but I'm onto her.

974
00:40:17,249 --> 00:40:19,582
- You know, it's okay to admit
that you miss those times

975
00:40:19,618 --> 00:40:20,517
with them.

976
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:24,053
- That well of nostalgia
dried up a long time ago.

977
00:40:26,291 --> 00:40:28,425
Bill Ryan made sure of that.

978
00:40:30,662 --> 00:40:31,561
- Okay.

979
00:40:33,498 --> 00:40:34,431
Have you seen mom?

980
00:40:35,367 --> 00:40:37,801
- She went to meet a
friend for dessert.

981
00:40:37,836 --> 00:40:41,538
- All right. Well, I'm going
to go see pat down at the pub.

982
00:40:41,573 --> 00:40:42,505
I'll see you later?

983
00:40:47,913 --> 00:40:51,347
(indistinct chattering)

984
00:40:53,819 --> 00:40:54,984
hey.

985
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:55,919
- Hey.

986
00:40:57,522 --> 00:40:59,989
Your deck house is
really coming along.

987
00:41:00,025 --> 00:41:00,990
- Oh, thanks.

988
00:41:01,026 --> 00:41:02,025
Yeah, yours too.

989
00:41:02,928 --> 00:41:04,928
Hey look, about what
I said at the market.

990
00:41:06,064 --> 00:41:09,299
You know, I think a couple of
decades of listening to my dad

991
00:41:10,435 --> 00:41:12,836
complain about your father's
work, it kinda creeped in.

992
00:41:12,871 --> 00:41:14,437
So,

993
00:41:14,473 --> 00:41:15,305
I'm sorry.

994
00:41:17,108 --> 00:41:20,176
I think your dad's really upped
his game lately, actually.

995
00:41:20,212 --> 00:41:21,611
- Thanks.

996
00:41:21,646 --> 00:41:23,379
And I'm sorry too.

997
00:41:25,484 --> 00:41:26,983
Oh!

998
00:41:27,018 --> 00:41:30,420
Oh, no! What's
happening? (laughs)

999
00:41:30,455 --> 00:41:32,755
I guess we're in the
middle of a snowball fight.

1000
00:41:32,791 --> 00:41:34,958
(crowd yelling and laughing)

1001
00:41:34,993 --> 00:41:36,426
- watch out! Watch out!

1002
00:41:36,461 --> 00:41:37,494
Ah!

1003
00:41:37,529 --> 00:41:38,495
(laughing)

1004
00:41:38,530 --> 00:41:40,797
- oh, goodness. Are you okay?

1005
00:41:40,832 --> 00:41:44,434
- I don't think
anything's broken.

1006
00:41:44,469 --> 00:41:46,836
- Oh, you've got a little...

1007
00:41:55,514 --> 00:41:56,346
- Check it out.

1008
00:41:58,416 --> 00:41:59,616
- The grandkids together.

1009
00:41:59,651 --> 00:42:00,650
- Oh, yeah.

1010
00:42:00,685 --> 00:42:02,318
- It would be so good for them.

1011
00:42:10,028 --> 00:42:13,196
- So you two have been
meeting since we were kids?

1012
00:42:13,231 --> 00:42:14,397
- Mm.
- Mm hm.

1013
00:42:14,432 --> 00:42:17,667
- Just because your fathers
have held this ridiculous grudge

1014
00:42:17,702 --> 00:42:19,769
never meant we had to
stop being friends.

1015
00:42:19,804 --> 00:42:22,605
- We still take a girls trip
to Virginia beach every summer.

1016
00:42:22,641 --> 00:42:23,773
- [Arlene] mm hm.

1017
00:42:23,808 --> 00:42:25,775
- And dad and
frank have no idea?

1018
00:42:25,810 --> 00:42:28,511
- They're just too
stubborn to acknowledge it.

1019
00:42:28,547 --> 00:42:31,281
They're both right about
each other in a lot of ways.

1020
00:42:31,316 --> 00:42:33,283
- I think deep down they
know we're still close.

1021
00:42:33,318 --> 00:42:35,184
- Yeah, I saw dad looking
at those ornaments

1022
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:36,853
you tried to hide
behind the tree.

1023
00:42:36,888 --> 00:42:37,921
He didn't seem to mind.

1024
00:42:37,956 --> 00:42:40,023
- Oh, it's just pigheadedness.

1025
00:42:40,058 --> 00:42:41,691
- It's like bill and the store.

1026
00:42:41,726 --> 00:42:43,393
He put money before good sense.

1027
00:42:43,428 --> 00:42:45,695
We never should've opened
the other location.

1028
00:42:46,565 --> 00:42:47,697
Carla knows.

1029
00:42:47,732 --> 00:42:48,898
- Oh, wow.

1030
00:42:48,934 --> 00:42:52,235
I guess everyone's up to speed
on all the family secrets.

1031
00:42:52,270 --> 00:42:53,736
- Yeah, with one exception.

1032
00:42:54,606 --> 00:42:57,206
What are you two
doing out altogether?

1033
00:42:57,242 --> 00:42:58,041
- Aah.

1034
00:42:58,076 --> 00:42:59,275
- Are you a date?

1035
00:42:59,311 --> 00:43:01,444
- What? No.
- No, no.

1036
00:43:01,479 --> 00:43:05,882
We, we just bumped into each
other and then we saw...

1037
00:43:05,917 --> 00:43:06,749
Not a date.

1038
00:43:06,785 --> 00:43:07,884
- Yeah, no.

1039
00:43:07,919 --> 00:43:09,285
But we should get out of here.

1040
00:43:09,321 --> 00:43:10,119
- Yes.

1041
00:43:10,155 --> 00:43:11,321
Let's leave you to it.

1042
00:43:11,356 --> 00:43:12,288
- Let you finish your...

1043
00:43:12,324 --> 00:43:14,524
- And don't worry, your
secret's safe with us.

1044
00:43:18,263 --> 00:43:22,065
- They came in together and
now they're leaving together.

1045
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:23,499
- Seems like a date to me.

1046
00:43:23,535 --> 00:43:24,734
- Oh yes it does.

1047
00:43:24,769 --> 00:43:26,903
(Carla and Arlene laughing)

1048
00:43:26,938 --> 00:43:28,504
- I can't believe it.

1049
00:43:28,540 --> 00:43:30,807
They kept their friendship
a secret for all these years

1050
00:43:30,842 --> 00:43:32,809
without anybody knowing it.

1051
00:43:32,844 --> 00:43:34,110
- Yeah.

1052
00:43:34,145 --> 00:43:35,278
- I didn't think my
mother had it in her.

1053
00:43:35,313 --> 00:43:36,212
- Yeah.

1054
00:43:39,351 --> 00:43:41,017
- What, you're thinking about
your dad and the stores,

1055
00:43:41,052 --> 00:43:43,353
aren't you?

1056
00:43:43,388 --> 00:43:44,821
You know, maybe I can help.

1057
00:43:46,191 --> 00:43:48,024
Put that MBA to use.

1058
00:43:48,059 --> 00:43:50,326
Sometimes it's good to have
an outside pair of eyes

1059
00:43:50,362 --> 00:43:51,794
to take a look.

1060
00:43:51,830 --> 00:43:54,263
- That is a very,
very nice offer,

1061
00:43:54,299 --> 00:43:57,000
but my dad's head would
explode if he knew a Scotto

1062
00:43:57,035 --> 00:43:58,801
was looking at
the company books.

1063
00:44:00,338 --> 00:44:02,438
- Well...

1064
00:44:02,474 --> 00:44:05,308
Maybe we don't tell them.

1065
00:44:06,211 --> 00:44:08,845
If our mothers can pull
off a little subterfuge,

1066
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:10,413
why can't you and I?

1067
00:44:11,916 --> 00:44:14,050
- Meet me at the
store in the morning?

1068
00:44:14,085 --> 00:44:14,984
- It's a da-

1069
00:44:16,554 --> 00:44:18,454
an appointment, an appointment.

1070
00:44:20,558 --> 00:44:21,357
- An appointment?

1071
00:44:21,393 --> 00:44:22,058
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1072
00:44:22,093 --> 00:44:26,295
("deck the halls" instrumental)

1073
00:44:29,834 --> 00:44:31,401
- is this all of it?

1074
00:44:31,436 --> 00:44:33,136
- What, you want
there to be more?

1075
00:44:34,539 --> 00:44:36,873
I'll give it to my father,
he is well organized.

1076
00:44:36,908 --> 00:44:38,975
- Well, let's get through
as much of it as we can

1077
00:44:39,010 --> 00:44:41,177
before we have to get
back to the contest.

1078
00:44:44,349 --> 00:44:47,250
(gentle piano music)

1079
00:44:47,285 --> 00:44:50,353
come on, grab the
spreadsheet, dig in.

1080
00:44:50,388 --> 00:44:52,355
- Right.

1081
00:44:52,390 --> 00:44:55,491
(gentle piano music)

1082
00:45:02,701 --> 00:45:05,868
(birds chirping)

1083
00:45:05,904 --> 00:45:06,803
- what's wrong?

1084
00:45:08,006 --> 00:45:11,074
- I think I figured out how to
make those icicles look like

1085
00:45:11,109 --> 00:45:12,775
they're melting.

1086
00:45:12,811 --> 00:45:13,710
But...

1087
00:45:15,113 --> 00:45:16,446
- But what?

1088
00:45:16,481 --> 00:45:17,780
- Means, we're going to
have to take them down

1089
00:45:17,816 --> 00:45:19,248
and redo them.

1090
00:45:19,284 --> 00:45:21,384
- No. Pop, we don't
have time for that.

1091
00:45:21,419 --> 00:45:22,618
- No, we can do it.

1092
00:45:22,654 --> 00:45:23,786
It'll only takes
a couple of hours.

1093
00:45:23,822 --> 00:45:27,390
This needs to be perfect.
It needs to be my best work.

1094
00:45:27,425 --> 00:45:30,693
It's what the people expect.
It's what I expect of myself.

1095
00:45:30,729 --> 00:45:31,728
Nothing less.

1096
00:45:32,664 --> 00:45:35,431
(curious music)

1097
00:45:41,473 --> 00:45:43,372
- don't be too hard
on yourself, dad.

1098
00:45:43,408 --> 00:45:45,208
Still got one more
day to make it sing.

1099
00:45:45,243 --> 00:45:46,809
Plus we only have to be good
enough to get in the finals,

1100
00:45:46,845 --> 00:45:48,077
right?

1101
00:45:48,113 --> 00:45:49,278
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1102
00:45:58,923 --> 00:46:00,990
- Well that doesn't
look like much.

1103
00:46:01,025 --> 00:46:03,793
- Oh! (laughing)

1104
00:46:03,828 --> 00:46:06,229
- well, that's because they
haven't turned it on yet.

1105
00:46:08,099 --> 00:46:10,500
- And that's it for
today, everyone!

1106
00:46:10,535 --> 00:46:13,736
We'll be picking the two
finalists tomorrow evening.

1107
00:46:13,772 --> 00:46:16,472
So make your last day count.

1108
00:46:16,508 --> 00:46:18,040
See y'all in the morning!

1109
00:46:19,677 --> 00:46:20,676
- Woo!

1110
00:46:20,712 --> 00:46:24,013
Haha! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1111
00:46:24,048 --> 00:46:24,847
Yes!

1112
00:46:24,883 --> 00:46:26,015
(techno music blaring)

1113
00:46:26,050 --> 00:46:26,949
ha!

1114
00:46:26,985 --> 00:46:28,117
Woo!

1115
00:46:28,153 --> 00:46:29,085
- Okay.

1116
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:30,787
- What'd I tell you
about the cross beams?

1117
00:46:30,822 --> 00:46:32,789
You didn't want to have
them, but I was right again.

1118
00:46:32,824 --> 00:46:33,790
Wade wins again!

1119
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:37,426
- Still think it
doesn't look like much?

1120
00:46:40,131 --> 00:46:43,266
(gentle piano music)

1121
00:46:47,906 --> 00:46:48,771
- you're up early.

1122
00:46:48,807 --> 00:46:50,306
- Yeah.

1123
00:46:50,341 --> 00:46:52,308
A friend just asked me to
go through their company's

1124
00:46:52,343 --> 00:46:55,444
financials to see if I
could diagnose any problems,

1125
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:57,446
coming up with a few ideas.

1126
00:46:57,482 --> 00:46:59,148
It's been kind of fun actually.

1127
00:47:00,118 --> 00:47:02,952
You know, I feel like
I can genuinely help.

1128
00:47:02,987 --> 00:47:03,519
It feels good.

1129
00:47:03,555 --> 00:47:05,321
- Anthony, that's great.

1130
00:47:05,356 --> 00:47:06,689
- Yeah.

1131
00:47:06,724 --> 00:47:08,391
- Good to see that
glimmer in your eye again.

1132
00:47:08,426 --> 00:47:09,892
- Thank you.

1133
00:47:09,928 --> 00:47:10,827
- This last year, I've
seen how hard you've been

1134
00:47:10,862 --> 00:47:11,928
on yourself.

1135
00:47:12,997 --> 00:47:14,831
I was starting to worry
that maybe you were taking

1136
00:47:14,866 --> 00:47:16,299
after your old man.

1137
00:47:16,334 --> 00:47:18,634
- (laughs) what do
you mean by that?

1138
00:47:18,670 --> 00:47:21,370
- Nothing. Nevermind.

1139
00:47:21,406 --> 00:47:22,672
- No. Hey pop, come on.

1140
00:47:22,707 --> 00:47:24,307
You can't just come...

1141
00:47:24,342 --> 00:47:26,843
I mean, take a seat. Talk
to me. What do you mean?

1142
00:47:32,183 --> 00:47:34,383
- Those first bright
nights contests,

1143
00:47:35,253 --> 00:47:37,587
every time I won, first
thought I had was,

1144
00:47:37,622 --> 00:47:40,189
"how am I going to
top myself again?"

1145
00:47:40,225 --> 00:47:42,191
I got so in my head about it,

1146
00:47:42,227 --> 00:47:44,126
it's why I couldn't
finish that year.

1147
00:47:45,196 --> 00:47:48,698
I stopped competing completely
because I was embarrassed.

1148
00:47:50,068 --> 00:47:52,235
I thought this year was
going to be different,

1149
00:47:52,270 --> 00:47:55,238
but we are one day away and
I can't make heads or tails

1150
00:47:55,273 --> 00:47:57,640
of what I want to do or
what I'm trying to do.

1151
00:47:59,043 --> 00:48:01,244
I'm worried we're not
going to finish again.

1152
00:48:02,146 --> 00:48:03,045
- Pop.

1153
00:48:04,482 --> 00:48:07,016
Come on. We're going
to finish, okay?

1154
00:48:08,052 --> 00:48:10,419
I promise, whatever it
takes we're going to finish.

1155
00:48:13,258 --> 00:48:14,090
Okay?

1156
00:48:18,062 --> 00:48:20,696
(bill singing)

1157
00:48:28,239 --> 00:48:29,872
- morning, dad.

1158
00:48:29,908 --> 00:48:30,907
- Oh, hey kiddo.

1159
00:48:34,178 --> 00:48:35,244
Everything all right?

1160
00:48:36,114 --> 00:48:37,013
- Yeah.

1161
00:48:37,048 --> 00:48:38,648
Sarah and I are supposed
to go to this party.

1162
00:48:38,683 --> 00:48:40,283
It's something that
should be good for us,

1163
00:48:40,318 --> 00:48:42,118
for our business, but...

1164
00:48:42,153 --> 00:48:43,753
- You'd rather not.

1165
00:48:44,789 --> 00:48:47,490
- The last few weeks we
haven't felt like partners.

1166
00:48:47,525 --> 00:48:49,492
It's been the Sarah show.

1167
00:48:49,527 --> 00:48:52,428
I can't tell if it's
because she's right

1168
00:48:52,463 --> 00:48:54,130
and my design sense is way off,

1169
00:48:54,165 --> 00:48:56,499
or if she just decided
that her opinion matters

1170
00:48:56,534 --> 00:48:57,433
more than mine.

1171
00:48:59,137 --> 00:49:01,637
- Well, now I understand
why you're so hesitant to

1172
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:04,907
give up your creative input.

1173
00:49:04,943 --> 00:49:06,509
- I know how much this
contest means to you.

1174
00:49:06,544 --> 00:49:08,077
I didn't want to
lead you astray.

1175
00:49:08,112 --> 00:49:11,247
- (laughs) that's the last
thing I'd ever worry about,

1176
00:49:11,282 --> 00:49:12,581
grace.

1177
00:49:12,617 --> 00:49:15,418
- I guess I'm just
nervous to talk with Sarah

1178
00:49:15,453 --> 00:49:16,585
about all of this,

1179
00:49:16,621 --> 00:49:19,021
because I know there's a chance
that this could be the end

1180
00:49:19,057 --> 00:49:22,091
of everything we built together,
even worse, our friendship.

1181
00:49:24,062 --> 00:49:24,994
- All right.

1182
00:49:25,029 --> 00:49:29,098
It's your voice, your
creativity. (laughs)

1183
00:49:29,133 --> 00:49:31,534
that's what makes
you so special.

1184
00:49:31,569 --> 00:49:34,303
You can't let anyone tap
it down or drown it out.

1185
00:49:34,339 --> 00:49:37,006
A real partner will value
all of your opinions,

1186
00:49:38,509 --> 00:49:40,943
even if sometimes
it may be wrong.

1187
00:49:40,979 --> 00:49:42,378
You know?

1188
00:49:42,413 --> 00:49:43,946
Speaking of which,

1189
00:49:43,982 --> 00:49:47,616
if you have any miracle
fixes for this deck house,

1190
00:49:48,553 --> 00:49:50,052
now's the time.

1191
00:49:50,088 --> 00:49:51,220
- It looks good, dad.

1192
00:49:51,255 --> 00:49:54,190
- Good's not going to cut
it where wade is concerned.

1193
00:49:55,426 --> 00:49:56,359
- Don't lose hope.

1194
00:49:57,395 --> 00:49:58,828
- I'm not.

1195
00:49:58,863 --> 00:50:01,197
I'm just looking at the
reality of the things.

1196
00:50:03,835 --> 00:50:06,702
Anyway, I should get ready,
it's going to be a long day.

1197
00:50:08,406 --> 00:50:09,839
Chin up.

1198
00:50:09,874 --> 00:50:10,773
- Thanks.

1199
00:50:11,542 --> 00:50:14,377
(cheerful music)

1200
00:50:29,961 --> 00:50:33,262
("deck the halls" tune)

1201
00:50:37,969 --> 00:50:40,336
- all right, load it out.

1202
00:50:41,139 --> 00:50:42,038
Easy does it.

1203
00:50:52,650 --> 00:50:55,551
- Everyone's acting like
we already lost weight.

1204
00:50:55,586 --> 00:50:57,086
- Well, yeah, but I mean...

1205
00:50:59,857 --> 00:51:01,290
Step into my office.

1206
00:51:05,196 --> 00:51:06,829
(grace sighs)

1207
00:51:06,864 --> 00:51:09,965
look, based on where both
of our houses are at,

1208
00:51:10,001 --> 00:51:12,601
neither one of them is going
to take us into the finals.

1209
00:51:13,738 --> 00:51:16,138
- Yeah, but we just need one
of us to get to the finals,

1210
00:51:16,174 --> 00:51:17,673
and then we've got a shot.

1211
00:51:17,708 --> 00:51:19,175
- True.

1212
00:51:19,210 --> 00:51:21,911
- I have an idea of how
we could do this, but...

1213
00:51:21,946 --> 00:51:22,812
- What?

1214
00:51:28,319 --> 00:51:28,984
Wow, that...

1215
00:51:29,020 --> 00:51:31,220
That's beautiful. You drew that?

1216
00:51:32,390 --> 00:51:34,490
But that's way more
than a day's work.

1217
00:51:34,525 --> 00:51:36,292
- Yeah, for three people it is,

1218
00:51:36,327 --> 00:51:38,894
but with seven, we
could pull it off.

1219
00:51:40,298 --> 00:51:42,431
- Where you going to get
these extra four people?

1220
00:51:44,635 --> 00:51:47,670
(mischievous tones)

1221
00:51:48,806 --> 00:51:49,705
no.

1222
00:51:49,740 --> 00:51:51,207
My family?

1223
00:51:51,242 --> 00:51:52,475
- Well, you just said that
neither one of our houses

1224
00:51:52,510 --> 00:51:54,276
are good enough to
make it to the finals.

1225
00:51:54,312 --> 00:51:56,645
But if our families
work together,

1226
00:51:56,681 --> 00:51:59,115
maybe we could bring out
the best in each other.

1227
00:52:00,751 --> 00:52:03,319
- Or if the last 20 years
have been any indication,

1228
00:52:03,354 --> 00:52:05,020
maybe we'll bring out the worst.

1229
00:52:05,957 --> 00:52:08,624
- Did you bump your head
on the ice or something?

1230
00:52:08,659 --> 00:52:11,393
I would rather hang
up the lights for good

1231
00:52:11,429 --> 00:52:13,062
than work with bill Ryan again.

1232
00:52:13,097 --> 00:52:14,563
- You know what?

1233
00:52:14,599 --> 00:52:16,465
If partnering up with him
is a more painful thought

1234
00:52:16,501 --> 00:52:19,001
than letting wade and
his carnival light show

1235
00:52:19,036 --> 00:52:22,271
walk away with the
title, then fine, don't.

1236
00:52:23,341 --> 00:52:25,574
But if decorating means
as much as I know it does

1237
00:52:25,610 --> 00:52:29,044
to you, then temporarily
putting aside your pride,

1238
00:52:30,014 --> 00:52:31,380
it's a small price to pay.

1239
00:52:33,551 --> 00:52:36,051
Look, I said we'd do
whatever it takes to finish,

1240
00:52:37,188 --> 00:52:38,521
whatever it takes.

1241
00:52:40,024 --> 00:52:41,223
This is what it takes.

1242
00:52:43,461 --> 00:52:44,827
- Well, what does bill say?

1243
00:52:45,630 --> 00:52:47,096
- Bill?

1244
00:52:47,131 --> 00:52:48,063
He's...

1245
00:52:48,099 --> 00:52:49,031
- Open to it.

1246
00:52:50,134 --> 00:52:51,333
- Really?

1247
00:52:51,369 --> 00:52:53,035
- Well he didn't say no.

1248
00:52:53,070 --> 00:52:53,903
- Hm.

1249
00:52:55,072 --> 00:52:56,138
The kids are right.

1250
00:52:56,174 --> 00:52:57,940
There's no way our two
houses are going to make it

1251
00:52:57,975 --> 00:52:58,974
to the finals.

1252
00:52:59,911 --> 00:53:01,110
- Okay.

1253
00:53:01,145 --> 00:53:03,679
So we work together,
temporarily,

1254
00:53:03,714 --> 00:53:05,581
just so we have a better chance.

1255
00:53:05,616 --> 00:53:06,282
- All right.

1256
00:53:06,317 --> 00:53:08,517
But if that happens and we win,

1257
00:53:08,553 --> 00:53:11,520
we split the contract and
the money, 50/50, okay?

1258
00:53:17,161 --> 00:53:18,561
- [frank] let's go to work.

1259
00:53:18,596 --> 00:53:19,962
- [bill] let's.

1260
00:53:19,997 --> 00:53:23,032
- You and the scottos want
to partner up. Really?

1261
00:53:23,067 --> 00:53:24,233
- Yeah, exactly.

1262
00:53:24,268 --> 00:53:27,870
We want to join forces and work
on just this house together.

1263
00:53:27,905 --> 00:53:29,772
- Well, there's nothing in the
competition agreement saying

1264
00:53:29,807 --> 00:53:32,141
that you can't decorate
one house together,

1265
00:53:32,176 --> 00:53:34,310
but I do want to run
it by the other teams.

1266
00:53:34,345 --> 00:53:35,711
- Oh, we asked.

1267
00:53:35,746 --> 00:53:36,979
Mistletoe designs
already signed off on it.

1268
00:53:37,014 --> 00:53:37,646
- What about wade?

1269
00:53:37,682 --> 00:53:39,615
- They have my full support.

1270
00:53:41,018 --> 00:53:41,984
Can't wait to see
what rabbit hole

1271
00:53:42,019 --> 00:53:44,386
their collective
imaginations take them down.

1272
00:53:44,422 --> 00:53:46,622
- Since their team now
consists of seven people,

1273
00:53:46,657 --> 00:53:49,725
I think it only fair that
mistletoe designs and glowscapes

1274
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:50,659
add to theirs.

1275
00:53:50,695 --> 00:53:52,661
- Mm. I feel good about
our current number.

1276
00:53:52,697 --> 00:53:55,231
More people would
feel unnecessary.

1277
00:53:55,266 --> 00:53:57,299
(Wendy and wade laughing)

1278
00:53:57,335 --> 00:53:59,969
- I'll let mistletoe designs
know where things stand.

1279
00:54:02,540 --> 00:54:04,974
You have less than half a day.

1280
00:54:05,009 --> 00:54:08,577
If your house isn't
finished by 6:00 pm tonight,

1281
00:54:08,613 --> 00:54:10,279
you're both disqualified.

1282
00:54:10,314 --> 00:54:11,280
- Yep. Understood.

1283
00:54:14,385 --> 00:54:15,284
- So?

1284
00:54:15,319 --> 00:54:16,352
- We got the sign-off.

1285
00:54:16,387 --> 00:54:18,420
- Okay. Let's see those designs.

1286
00:54:18,456 --> 00:54:19,555
- She's really good, frank.

1287
00:54:19,590 --> 00:54:23,292
My designs have been uninspired
for a long time, but...

1288
00:54:23,327 --> 00:54:25,327
Well, she's got a good eye.

1289
00:54:26,697 --> 00:54:28,664
- These are all really great.

1290
00:54:28,699 --> 00:54:31,433
- Okay. Well where
do you want us?

1291
00:54:32,536 --> 00:54:35,037
- I want two people on the
roof, two on the ground.

1292
00:54:35,072 --> 00:54:36,438
Knock this out real quick.

1293
00:54:36,474 --> 00:54:37,706
- Yeah, okay.
- Okay.

1294
00:54:37,742 --> 00:54:38,474
- [tony] I'll hit the roof.
- Come on.

1295
00:54:39,243 --> 00:54:42,111
(cheerful music)

1296
00:54:47,351 --> 00:54:51,353
- where do you want this one?
- Right over there.

1297
00:54:54,425 --> 00:54:55,557
- I think we're pulling it off.

1298
00:54:55,593 --> 00:54:58,494
- I had no worries whatsoever.

1299
00:54:58,529 --> 00:55:00,996
Okay, fine. It was
a Christmas miracle.

1300
00:55:01,032 --> 00:55:03,465
- Hopefully it's enough
to get us in the finals.

1301
00:55:09,407 --> 00:55:11,807
- Let's give another
big round of applause

1302
00:55:11,842 --> 00:55:13,809
to our four teams!

1303
00:55:13,844 --> 00:55:16,011
They all did such incredible
work, didn't they?

1304
00:55:16,047 --> 00:55:17,212
Woo!

1305
00:55:17,248 --> 00:55:18,747
(crowd applauding)

1306
00:55:18,783 --> 00:55:21,917
but we all know that only
two teams will be moving on

1307
00:55:21,952 --> 00:55:24,053
to compete in the finals.

1308
00:55:24,088 --> 00:55:27,823
Our first bright
nights finalist is...

1309
00:55:27,858 --> 00:55:28,757
Glowscapes!

1310
00:55:28,793 --> 00:55:30,059
- Yes!

1311
00:55:30,094 --> 00:55:32,895
Come on! Yeah! Cross
beams! Cross beams!

1312
00:55:32,930 --> 00:55:35,064
And competing against glowscapes

1313
00:55:35,099 --> 00:55:38,734
in our 15th annual bright
nights finals is...

1314
00:55:39,904 --> 00:55:43,339
The combined team of good
tidings and deck the halls!

1315
00:55:43,374 --> 00:55:47,176
(cheering and clapping)

1316
00:55:47,211 --> 00:55:51,347
hope to see you all back for
the finals in two nights time.

1317
00:55:51,382 --> 00:55:53,716
Good night, everyone! Woo!

1318
00:55:53,751 --> 00:55:54,783
(crowd clapping)
- all right.

1319
00:55:54,819 --> 00:55:56,018
Congratulations!

1320
00:55:56,053 --> 00:55:57,186
- We just have to
do it one more time.

1321
00:55:57,221 --> 00:55:58,354
We got this.

1322
00:55:58,389 --> 00:55:59,955
- Another step
closer to $50,000.

1323
00:55:59,990 --> 00:56:02,358
- See, he's always
talking about the money.

1324
00:56:02,393 --> 00:56:04,093
- Hey, hey, come on, dad.

1325
00:56:04,128 --> 00:56:06,695
- At least I'm not so
self-centered that I have to be

1326
00:56:06,731 --> 00:56:08,564
perfect at everything I do.

1327
00:56:08,599 --> 00:56:09,398
- Dad.

1328
00:56:09,433 --> 00:56:10,632
- No, no, no.

1329
00:56:10,668 --> 00:56:11,467
Rather confront the
fact that you can't stay

1330
00:56:11,502 --> 00:56:13,302
out of your own way.

1331
00:56:13,337 --> 00:56:16,472
He blew up our partnership,
our friendship.

1332
00:56:16,507 --> 00:56:18,474
- The work has always
come first for me, bill.

1333
00:56:18,509 --> 00:56:20,542
It always has and
it always will.

1334
00:56:20,578 --> 00:56:22,544
You never understood that.

1335
00:56:22,580 --> 00:56:26,048
- What I understood
all too well back then

1336
00:56:26,083 --> 00:56:29,284
was that your perfectionism
was never about the jobs,

1337
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:32,054
it was all about
satisfying your own ego.

1338
00:56:32,089 --> 00:56:33,455
Decorating was never
about other people,

1339
00:56:33,491 --> 00:56:36,291
it was always about you,
making yourself happy.

1340
00:56:36,327 --> 00:56:37,493
- Okay, come on. Let's cool it.

1341
00:56:37,528 --> 00:56:38,994
- Yeah. It's been a long day.

1342
00:56:39,029 --> 00:56:41,063
Let's just all go home
before you say something

1343
00:56:41,098 --> 00:56:42,631
you can't take back, okay?

1344
00:56:44,435 --> 00:56:45,801
- A little late for that.

1345
00:56:48,172 --> 00:56:51,073
- [grace] dad, come on.

1346
00:56:58,182 --> 00:56:59,548
Ey

1347
00:56:59,583 --> 00:57:00,916
- didn't wrestle.

1348
00:57:00,951 --> 00:57:03,485
- Well, tomorrow is another day.

1349
00:57:03,521 --> 00:57:05,053
- Do we need to reexplain

1350
00:57:05,089 --> 00:57:06,722
- the concept of

1351
00:57:06,757 --> 00:57:08,157
- naughty or nice to them?

1352
00:57:08,192 --> 00:57:09,425
- Couldn't hurt.

1353
00:57:09,460 --> 00:57:11,593
So do you have any
plans for this evening?

1354
00:57:11,629 --> 00:57:12,861
- Yeah, I'm heading to Richmond.

1355
00:57:12,897 --> 00:57:16,398
My business partner and I got
invited to this holiday party

1356
00:57:16,434 --> 00:57:18,200
these producers are throwing.

1357
00:57:18,235 --> 00:57:20,602
- And what do these
producers produce?

1358
00:57:20,638 --> 00:57:21,870
- Reality tv.

1359
00:57:22,973 --> 00:57:26,575
They approached us about
doing a home staging show

1360
00:57:26,610 --> 00:57:28,410
and Sarah and I
would be the hosts.

1361
00:57:29,980 --> 00:57:32,881
- How am I just hearing
about this? That's amazing.

1362
00:57:35,286 --> 00:57:38,387
Well, hopefully we can keep
them on their best behavior

1363
00:57:38,422 --> 00:57:39,455
tomorrow.

1364
00:57:39,490 --> 00:57:40,856
- (laughs) yeah, good luck.

1365
00:57:42,393 --> 00:57:43,926
- Uh...

1366
00:57:43,961 --> 00:57:45,093
Night
- night, yep

1367
00:57:50,734 --> 00:57:53,068
(sighs)

1368
00:57:53,103 --> 00:57:53,936
- what's wrong?

1369
00:57:53,971 --> 00:57:55,604
- My mom has my car keys.

1370
00:57:57,174 --> 00:57:58,340
- Really?

1371
00:57:58,375 --> 00:57:59,908
- Yeah, she borrowed them to
get an extra pair of gloves

1372
00:57:59,944 --> 00:58:01,810
and I forgot to
get the keys back.

1373
00:58:01,846 --> 00:58:04,746
- Jeez. That's too bad.

1374
00:58:04,782 --> 00:58:05,614
- Yeah.

1375
00:58:08,752 --> 00:58:11,153
- Well. Have a great night.

1376
00:58:11,188 --> 00:58:12,588
- Oh, tony!

1377
00:58:12,623 --> 00:58:13,455
- What?

1378
00:58:14,959 --> 00:58:16,124
I'm just kidding.

1379
00:58:17,628 --> 00:58:19,127
Come on, I'll give you a ride,

1380
00:58:19,163 --> 00:58:21,263
but this really
does make a square.

1381
00:58:22,099 --> 00:58:22,965
- Totally.

1382
00:58:25,369 --> 00:58:27,736
(grace laughs)

1383
00:58:27,771 --> 00:58:31,807
("deck the halls" instrumental)

1384
00:58:32,710 --> 00:58:35,010
- it's a good thing
you had that extra key.

1385
00:58:35,045 --> 00:58:37,112
- A girl scout always
has a backup plan.

1386
00:58:38,616 --> 00:58:41,283
- You sure you want me
to come to this party?

1387
00:58:41,318 --> 00:58:43,285
I'm not exactly dressed for it.

1388
00:58:43,320 --> 00:58:44,152
- You drove all this way,

1389
00:58:44,188 --> 00:58:45,854
let me at least buy
you a free drink

1390
00:58:45,890 --> 00:58:48,357
and fill you up on
canapes for the trouble.

1391
00:58:48,392 --> 00:58:50,325
- You've got a nice place.

1392
00:58:50,361 --> 00:58:53,495
It's almost like you
stage homes for a living.

1393
00:58:53,531 --> 00:58:54,796
- Like it?

1394
00:58:54,832 --> 00:58:56,098
- Yeah, it's...

1395
00:58:59,737 --> 00:59:01,270
It's beautiful.

1396
00:59:01,305 --> 00:59:03,939
(gentle piano music)

1397
00:59:03,974 --> 00:59:06,775
- I didn't bring any party
clothes to my parent's house,

1398
00:59:06,810 --> 00:59:08,176
so thanks for the pit stop.

1399
00:59:10,047 --> 00:59:11,313
Shall we?

1400
00:59:11,348 --> 00:59:12,581
- Let's do it.

1401
00:59:18,489 --> 00:59:21,356
- I just love Richmond
during the Christmas time.

1402
00:59:21,392 --> 00:59:22,691
- Yeah.

1403
00:59:22,726 --> 00:59:23,825
It's pretty special.

1404
00:59:25,262 --> 00:59:26,562
- Actually, the bar's
not too far from here.

1405
00:59:26,597 --> 00:59:28,196
Do you want to just walk?

1406
00:59:28,232 --> 00:59:29,197
- I'd love to.

1407
00:59:30,267 --> 00:59:31,733
Ooh! Ooh!
- Aah!

1408
00:59:31,769 --> 00:59:32,534
(laughing)

1409
00:59:32,570 --> 00:59:33,835
are you okay?

1410
00:59:33,871 --> 00:59:35,237
- Yeah.

1411
00:59:35,272 --> 00:59:36,738
- Wow, for a hockey player,

1412
00:59:36,774 --> 00:59:38,774
you aren't so
graceful on the ice.

1413
00:59:42,913 --> 00:59:43,845
- There she is.

1414
00:59:44,715 --> 00:59:45,614
- Hi.

1415
00:59:46,784 --> 00:59:47,983
- Don't worry about me.

1416
00:59:48,018 --> 00:59:50,085
You do your thing
and I'll go mingle.

1417
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:51,019
- Okay.

1418
00:59:52,089 --> 00:59:54,623
- Hey Henry, how are you guys?

1419
00:59:55,726 --> 00:59:57,893
- Our lustrous producer was
just asking us what the show

1420
00:59:57,928 --> 00:59:59,127
might be like.

1421
00:59:59,163 --> 01:00:02,598
- Well, we haven't had time
to discuss the direction yet,

1422
01:00:02,633 --> 01:00:04,099
but we're-

1423
01:00:04,134 --> 01:00:05,033
- but the show should follow
us meeting our clients

1424
01:00:05,069 --> 01:00:07,169
and seeing their houses
for the first time,

1425
01:00:07,204 --> 01:00:09,404
how we come up with the
design and the layouts,

1426
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:11,239
and you can give them
all those little details

1427
01:00:11,275 --> 01:00:13,408
about the furniture
you love to talk about.

1428
01:00:13,444 --> 01:00:17,045
And we can end each episode
with the houses being sold

1429
01:00:17,081 --> 01:00:18,947
for over asking, of course.

1430
01:00:18,983 --> 01:00:19,948
(Henry laughs)

1431
01:00:19,984 --> 01:00:21,717
- yeah, exactly.

1432
01:00:21,752 --> 01:00:23,785
- See, whole idea sells itself.

1433
01:00:23,821 --> 01:00:25,621
- It's got a perfectly
built-in structure.

1434
01:00:25,656 --> 01:00:26,655
It's really smart.

1435
01:00:27,591 --> 01:00:28,724
Can you excuse me for a minute?

1436
01:00:28,759 --> 01:00:30,192
Don't go. I'll be right back.

1437
01:00:33,397 --> 01:00:36,298
- Did you hear that?
He loved our idea.

1438
01:00:36,333 --> 01:00:39,401
The dynamic duo strikes again.

1439
01:00:39,436 --> 01:00:40,869
- Okay, about that,

1440
01:00:40,904 --> 01:00:43,739
I feel like we haven't
been much of a duo lately.

1441
01:00:44,942 --> 01:00:47,309
It feels more like
I'm your plus one.

1442
01:00:47,344 --> 01:00:48,076
- What?

1443
01:00:48,112 --> 01:00:49,144
How do you mean?

1444
01:00:49,179 --> 01:00:51,446
- Oh, you just been...

1445
01:00:52,549 --> 01:00:56,051
Really dismissive of my
ideas the past few months,

1446
01:00:56,086 --> 01:00:58,820
like my opinion doesn't seem
to matter to you anymore.

1447
01:00:58,856 --> 01:01:01,823
- Grace, your
opinion matters to me

1448
01:01:01,859 --> 01:01:03,825
when you stand behind it.

1449
01:01:03,861 --> 01:01:05,060
- What?

1450
01:01:05,095 --> 01:01:06,762
- If you really
believed in an idea,

1451
01:01:06,797 --> 01:01:08,997
then you need to push back.

1452
01:01:09,033 --> 01:01:10,332
But when you don't say anything,

1453
01:01:10,367 --> 01:01:12,801
I have to assume
we're in agreement.

1454
01:01:12,836 --> 01:01:14,269
I can't read your mind.

1455
01:01:14,304 --> 01:01:16,638
- Yeah, but you just
dismissed what I had to say

1456
01:01:16,674 --> 01:01:18,106
in front of Henry a second ago.

1457
01:01:18,142 --> 01:01:20,375
I'm not even sure you
know you're doing it.

1458
01:01:21,445 --> 01:01:24,112
- Maybe this isn't the best
place for us to be having

1459
01:01:24,148 --> 01:01:25,280
this conversation.

1460
01:01:26,216 --> 01:01:27,282
- Yeah, you're right.

1461
01:01:28,218 --> 01:01:29,051
I should go.

1462
01:01:36,460 --> 01:01:40,495
- Excuse me.

1463
01:01:40,531 --> 01:01:41,329
Hey.

1464
01:01:41,365 --> 01:01:42,798
- Can we go?

1465
01:01:42,833 --> 01:01:45,267
- Yeah, of course.
- Okay, thanks.

1466
01:01:50,974 --> 01:01:53,475
- Well, I think it's good
that you said something,

1467
01:01:53,510 --> 01:01:56,044
got it off your mind before
your business relationship

1468
01:01:56,080 --> 01:01:57,479
poisoned your friendship.

1469
01:02:00,584 --> 01:02:01,483
There you go.

1470
01:02:01,518 --> 01:02:02,451
- Thank you so much. Yah!

1471
01:02:02,486 --> 01:02:03,952
- I don't know how they do that.

1472
01:02:03,987 --> 01:02:06,054
You could not pay me
enough money to sing

1473
01:02:06,090 --> 01:02:07,255
in front of people.

1474
01:02:07,291 --> 01:02:10,225
- Well, you played hockey in
front of thousands of people

1475
01:02:10,260 --> 01:02:12,360
but you think singing is scary.

1476
01:02:12,396 --> 01:02:15,163
- You obviously have
not heard me sing.

1477
01:02:15,199 --> 01:02:16,631
- (laughing) you're
right. You're right.

1478
01:02:16,667 --> 01:02:17,733
But...

1479
01:02:17,768 --> 01:02:19,301
Come on. It can't be that bad.

1480
01:02:20,170 --> 01:02:21,369
- Ooh.

1481
01:02:21,405 --> 01:02:23,472
- When was the last
time you tried?

1482
01:02:24,675 --> 01:02:25,674
- Um.

1483
01:02:27,077 --> 01:02:30,412
Well, it wasn't the
last time, but...

1484
01:02:30,447 --> 01:02:33,148
This one Christmas,

1485
01:02:33,183 --> 01:02:35,717
my parents took maria
and I to Tuscany.

1486
01:02:35,753 --> 01:02:38,587
Actually it was right after
the falling out with your dad.

1487
01:02:38,622 --> 01:02:41,723
And my cousins, they have
this tradition where they

1488
01:02:41,759 --> 01:02:43,725
go through the
neighborhood door to door,

1489
01:02:43,761 --> 01:02:47,929
just belting out Italian
Christmas carols, right?

1490
01:02:47,965 --> 01:02:50,732
And then the neighbors come
out and they give you candy

1491
01:02:50,768 --> 01:02:52,701
and sweets for your trouble.

1492
01:02:53,537 --> 01:02:54,402
- That sounds like fun.

1493
01:02:54,438 --> 01:02:55,504
- Yeah,

1494
01:02:55,539 --> 01:02:56,404
it is.

1495
01:02:57,307 --> 01:02:59,708
But I think there's
something about singing

1496
01:02:59,743 --> 01:03:01,176
in a foreign language,

1497
01:03:01,211 --> 01:03:03,044
just makes you feel
less self-conscious,

1498
01:03:03,080 --> 01:03:05,013
because we barely
knew any Italian,

1499
01:03:05,048 --> 01:03:07,549
and my cousins didn't
know any English,

1500
01:03:07,584 --> 01:03:10,652
but somehow it just, it
brought us closer together.

1501
01:03:11,755 --> 01:03:15,190
I think mutual embarrassment
kind of tears down walls,

1502
01:03:15,225 --> 01:03:16,024
if that makes sense.

1503
01:03:16,059 --> 01:03:16,925
- Right. Yes.

1504
01:03:18,162 --> 01:03:19,861
- Ya know what? I have an idea.

1505
01:03:20,898 --> 01:03:22,397
Come on.

1506
01:03:22,432 --> 01:03:23,598
- Okay.

1507
01:03:23,634 --> 01:03:28,270
("deck the halls"
guitar instrumental)

1508
01:03:52,095 --> 01:03:53,962

- aww.

1512
01:04:17,621 --> 01:04:18,653
- Tone, what are you doing?

1513
01:04:18,689 --> 01:04:19,354
(grace laughs)

1514
01:04:19,389 --> 01:04:21,489
- I'm embarrassing myself, pop.

1515

(laughing)

1516
01:04:22,359 --> 01:04:23,792
- let's come inside.

1517
01:04:23,827 --> 01:04:26,027
We have plenty of vino
brulee, mom made struffoli.

1518
01:04:26,063 --> 01:04:27,028
Let's get out of the cold.

1519
01:04:27,064 --> 01:04:28,029
- No, no, no.

1520
01:04:28,065 --> 01:04:29,164
Actually, we were hoping
that you would join us

1521
01:04:29,199 --> 01:04:30,131
for another stop.

1522
01:04:33,303 --> 01:04:37,739

01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:17,746

1526
01:05:17,781 --> 01:05:20,048
That was beautiful!

1527
01:05:20,083 --> 01:05:21,616
Come in. Come in.

1528
01:05:31,528 --> 01:05:33,028
- Frank?

1529
01:05:33,063 --> 01:05:36,197
(gentle piano music)

1530
01:05:39,469 --> 01:05:41,069
- you were right, frank.

1531
01:05:42,172 --> 01:05:45,240
I put profit ahead of all the
work that we did together.

1532
01:05:47,611 --> 01:05:48,810
Instead of asking
you how you felt,

1533
01:05:48,845 --> 01:05:51,880
I pushed you into a place that
made you feel uncomfortable.

1534
01:05:55,218 --> 01:05:57,886
- Well, despite all that,

1535
01:05:58,755 --> 01:06:00,622
I know that you just
wanted to get the most

1536
01:06:00,657 --> 01:06:01,856
out of working together.

1537
01:06:03,327 --> 01:06:08,229
My stubbornness and my ego
kept me from seeing that.

1538
01:06:08,532 --> 01:06:09,331
- Yeah.

1539
01:06:10,434 --> 01:06:13,168
Remember joking about our
kids being together someday?

1540
01:06:14,271 --> 01:06:17,539
- Well, if we weren't so
wrapped up in holding grudges,

1541
01:06:17,574 --> 01:06:19,407
maybe it would have
happened sooner.

1542
01:06:25,949 --> 01:06:27,015
I'm sorry, bill.

1543
01:06:29,853 --> 01:06:32,020
- Me too, frank. Me too.

1544
01:06:47,704 --> 01:06:50,071
Same rules apply as before.

1545
01:06:50,107 --> 01:06:53,742
All we're asking for is
your most ambitious displays

1546
01:06:53,777 --> 01:06:55,577
of your lives!

1547
01:06:55,612 --> 01:06:58,046
You may start your sleighs...

1548
01:06:58,081 --> 01:06:59,147
Now!

1549
01:07:01,151 --> 01:07:02,684
- Okay.

1550
01:07:02,719 --> 01:07:03,518
- Okay.

1551
01:07:03,553 --> 01:07:05,420
So what's the plan?

1552
01:07:05,455 --> 01:07:07,889
- Well, actually your story
about Italy got me thinking

1553
01:07:07,924 --> 01:07:10,025
about other Italian
Christmas traditions.

1554
01:07:10,060 --> 01:07:13,128
So I did some research and
I found something I think

1555
01:07:13,163 --> 01:07:16,398
to be pretty interesting
and completely unexpected.

1556
01:07:17,934 --> 01:07:19,467
- A ceppo.

1557
01:07:19,503 --> 01:07:22,370
My grandparents always had a
tree of light at Christmas.

1558
01:07:22,406 --> 01:07:24,472
- And it can also
mean yule log, right?

1559
01:07:24,508 --> 01:07:25,940
- Yes.

1560
01:07:25,976 --> 01:07:27,175
The tradition is that you
cut a trunk of the tree

1561
01:07:27,210 --> 01:07:30,478
and you burn the log in the
fireplace on Christmas night.

1562
01:07:30,514 --> 01:07:32,647
And then the kids of the family,

1563
01:07:32,682 --> 01:07:35,784
they hit the burning embers
till the sparks fly up

1564
01:07:35,819 --> 01:07:37,318
into the air,

1565
01:07:37,354 --> 01:07:39,621
symbolizing the hopes of the
family for the coming year.

1566
01:07:41,191 --> 01:07:42,557
- Can we do it in two days?

1567
01:07:42,592 --> 01:07:44,993
- Well, give it a
detailed design,

1568
01:07:45,028 --> 01:07:48,096
no one second guessing
each other, complete focus

1569
01:07:48,131 --> 01:07:51,299
and every available family
member lending a hand.

1570
01:07:52,803 --> 01:07:53,768
Maybe.

1571
01:07:53,804 --> 01:07:55,670
(grace laughs)

1572
01:07:55,705 --> 01:07:56,371
- okay.

1573
01:07:56,406 --> 01:07:57,405
- Where do you want me to start?

1574
01:07:58,809 --> 01:08:01,009
- The lights tony and
grace are laying in,

1575
01:08:01,044 --> 01:08:03,745
are going to lead to the
second tier of the ceppo.

1576
01:08:03,780 --> 01:08:05,680
- Uh huh. It's
going to look great.

1577
01:08:05,715 --> 01:08:06,981
- I think so.
- Yep.

1578
01:08:08,885 --> 01:08:09,918
Hey grace.
- Hey.

1579
01:08:11,488 --> 01:08:13,655
- I just want to thank you.

1580
01:08:13,690 --> 01:08:14,656
- For what?

1581
01:08:16,026 --> 01:08:17,992
- For helping me to
realize why I got

1582
01:08:18,028 --> 01:08:21,129
into the decorating
business in the first place.

1583
01:08:21,164 --> 01:08:23,064
Doing this with the
people you love,

1584
01:08:23,967 --> 01:08:26,401
trying to bring a little
joy into the world.

1585
01:08:27,504 --> 01:08:30,605
That should have always been
more than enough, you know?

1586
01:08:32,576 --> 01:08:37,045
- Three, two, one,
everybody stop!

1587
01:08:37,080 --> 01:08:38,880
Tomorrow's the big day.

1588
01:08:38,915 --> 01:08:41,716
You'll have a few extra
hours to get every light,

1589
01:08:41,751 --> 01:08:43,852
bow and bow in its place.

1590
01:08:45,489 --> 01:08:47,822
- Let's see how this
looks, shall we?

1591
01:08:47,858 --> 01:08:51,326
("jingle bells" blaring)

1592
01:09:06,176 --> 01:09:07,041
boom.

1593
01:09:08,678 --> 01:09:09,978
Yeah.

1594
01:09:10,013 --> 01:09:11,379
- Whoa.

1595
01:09:11,414 --> 01:09:12,313
That was...

1596
01:09:13,416 --> 01:09:14,382
- Stunning.

1597
01:09:14,451 --> 01:09:16,484
- Yeah, if their goal is
to give people headache

1598
01:09:16,520 --> 01:09:18,553
and blurred vision, then
mission accomplished,

1599
01:09:18,588 --> 01:09:20,121
otherwise I'm not impressed.

1600
01:09:22,959 --> 01:09:24,058
- All right. Come on.

1601
01:09:25,896 --> 01:09:27,896
(grace and tony laugh)

1602
01:09:27,931 --> 01:09:28,930
- I think...

1603
01:09:28,965 --> 01:09:29,898
I think we're coming along.

1604
01:09:29,933 --> 01:09:32,333
- Yeah, we might even finish.

1605
01:09:32,369 --> 01:09:33,568
- We'd better.

1606
01:09:33,603 --> 01:09:35,904
I haven't been this exhausted
since two-a-days in college.

1607
01:09:35,939 --> 01:09:39,841
- Look, if you want to rest up
for tomorrow, I totally get.

1608
01:09:39,876 --> 01:09:41,943
- No, it's better to go over
things with your dad sooner

1609
01:09:41,978 --> 01:09:42,911
rather than later.

1610
01:09:42,946 --> 01:09:44,212
I'll see you at the house?

1611
01:09:44,247 --> 01:09:45,213
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1612
01:09:46,983 --> 01:09:48,750
- I don't know what
grace told you exactly,

1613
01:09:48,785 --> 01:09:51,119
but any financial issues
we have with the store,

1614
01:09:51,154 --> 01:09:51,819
I can handle.

1615
01:09:51,855 --> 01:09:54,055
- I'm not so sure that's true.

1616
01:09:54,090 --> 01:09:55,590
After looking into your records,

1617
01:09:55,625 --> 01:09:58,059
it seems like you guys
are a little bit behind-

1618
01:09:58,094 --> 01:10:00,695
- whoa, whoa, whoa. You
let him look at my records?

1619
01:10:00,730 --> 01:10:03,798
- Dad, just listen.

1620
01:10:03,833 --> 01:10:04,799
- Look.

1621
01:10:04,834 --> 01:10:07,468
The quickest way to ease
your monthly cash losses

1622
01:10:07,504 --> 01:10:09,270
would be to purchase
the building that houses

1623
01:10:09,306 --> 01:10:10,405
your midlothian store.

1624
01:10:10,440 --> 01:10:13,875
- Ha! That's your big idea?

1625
01:10:13,910 --> 01:10:15,410
You want me to spend more money?

1626
01:10:15,445 --> 01:10:16,411
- Actually, yes.

1627
01:10:16,479 --> 01:10:18,947
I looked into it and the
lease holding companies

1628
01:10:18,982 --> 01:10:21,482
are already unloaded a few
of their buildings this year

1629
01:10:21,518 --> 01:10:22,617
below cost.

1630
01:10:22,652 --> 01:10:24,552
They might welcome the
opportunity to get another one

1631
01:10:24,588 --> 01:10:26,087
off the books.

1632
01:10:26,122 --> 01:10:28,623
You'd use your inventory, which
you already own obviously,

1633
01:10:28,658 --> 01:10:30,258
as collateral for the loan.

1634
01:10:30,293 --> 01:10:31,793
Mr. Ryan, you do this,
you're going to save

1635
01:10:31,828 --> 01:10:33,995
about $2,000 a month.

1636
01:10:34,030 --> 01:10:36,064
- Which brings us
closer to even.

1637
01:10:36,099 --> 01:10:36,965
- Exactly.

1638
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:38,833
And you're putting
your money into equity,

1639
01:10:38,868 --> 01:10:40,401
which gives you
some flexibility,

1640
01:10:40,437 --> 01:10:42,570
if business doesn't
pick up right away.

1641
01:10:42,606 --> 01:10:44,305
Now your marketing,

1642
01:10:44,341 --> 01:10:47,842
which at the moment
is inventory focused.

1643
01:10:47,877 --> 01:10:50,078
It should really be about
letting customers know

1644
01:10:50,113 --> 01:10:51,913
what separates
you from the pack,

1645
01:10:51,948 --> 01:10:54,148
your expertise in refurbishing.

1646
01:10:54,184 --> 01:10:56,584
- Yeah, the part of the
business that you love, dad.

1647
01:10:56,620 --> 01:10:58,920
- Your competition in the
area either doesn't offer

1648
01:10:58,955 --> 01:11:01,189
that service or they don't
have anywhere near the amount

1649
01:11:01,224 --> 01:11:03,191
of years of expertise
that you do.

1650
01:11:03,226 --> 01:11:06,261
It's low overhead.
It's high return.

1651
01:11:06,296 --> 01:11:07,862
You're a craftsman

1652
01:11:07,897 --> 01:11:09,831
and your customers
need to know that.

1653
01:11:09,866 --> 01:11:10,965
- That's why people
came to your business

1654
01:11:11,001 --> 01:11:12,967
in the first place.

1655
01:11:13,003 --> 01:11:15,970
You're skilled to be able
to take a piece of furniture

1656
01:11:16,006 --> 01:11:18,206
and breathe new life into it.

1657
01:11:18,241 --> 01:11:19,774
- You see that? (laughs)

1658
01:11:19,809 --> 01:11:23,044
(Ryan's furniture, where what's
old can we made new again?(

1659
01:11:23,079 --> 01:11:23,878
I like that.

1660
01:11:23,913 --> 01:11:25,513
- Catchy.

1661
01:11:25,548 --> 01:11:27,815
- Now I know this
is a lot to chew on,

1662
01:11:27,851 --> 01:11:30,218
but I think these strategies
could really help put you

1663
01:11:30,253 --> 01:11:32,053
in a position of success.

1664
01:11:32,088 --> 01:11:34,856
- Well, if these numbers
are what they appear to be,

1665
01:11:34,891 --> 01:11:37,592
then what you're saying is...

1666
01:11:38,695 --> 01:11:40,128
Interesting.

1667
01:11:40,163 --> 01:11:41,462
- I can send you the files.

1668
01:11:41,498 --> 01:11:43,498
You can check the
numbers yourself.

1669
01:11:43,533 --> 01:11:45,166
Mr. Ryan...

1670
01:11:45,201 --> 01:11:46,334
I just wanted to help.

1671
01:11:50,206 --> 01:11:52,540
(men laugh)

1672
01:12:01,184 --> 01:12:03,418
- this should be enough
I think, don't you?

1673
01:12:03,453 --> 01:12:07,055
(cheerful Christmas tune)

1674
01:12:09,092 --> 01:12:11,326
- hey, pop. Be careful, will ya?

1675
01:12:11,361 --> 01:12:12,694
- Yes, I will.

1676
01:12:14,464 --> 01:12:15,763
- How's it look?

1677
01:12:15,799 --> 01:12:16,664
- Great.

1678
01:12:16,700 --> 01:12:19,067
Hey, there's somebody
here to see you.

1679
01:12:19,102 --> 01:12:20,068
- Oh, yeah? Who?

1680
01:12:24,307 --> 01:12:25,206
Hey.

1681
01:12:26,209 --> 01:12:28,543
- The decorations look amazing.

1682
01:12:28,578 --> 01:12:29,243
- Thanks.

1683
01:12:29,279 --> 01:12:31,012
We still have a long way to go.

1684
01:12:31,948 --> 01:12:33,748
You didn't have to come
all the way out here,

1685
01:12:33,783 --> 01:12:35,583
you could have just called.

1686
01:12:35,618 --> 01:12:37,719
- Somehow a phone call
didn't seem right.

1687
01:12:38,855 --> 01:12:41,956
Remember how hideous our
mount Kellogg dorm room was?

1688
01:12:41,991 --> 01:12:44,425
- Yeah, who could forget
those baby blue walls.

1689
01:12:45,628 --> 01:12:47,095
- But we made it work,

1690
01:12:47,130 --> 01:12:49,097
turned it into a spot they
would take applicants by

1691
01:12:49,132 --> 01:12:50,264
on the tour.

1692
01:12:50,300 --> 01:12:52,533
Show them how comfy
dorm life was.

1693
01:12:52,569 --> 01:12:54,369
- Our first home staging.

1694
01:12:54,404 --> 01:12:57,372
- Where our friendship
and our partnership began.

1695
01:12:59,175 --> 01:13:01,476
I'm really sorry, grace.

1696
01:13:01,511 --> 01:13:02,577
- Oh, Sarah, you don't-

1697
01:13:02,612 --> 01:13:04,145
- as soon as the possibility
of a show came around,

1698
01:13:04,180 --> 01:13:05,646
I just...

1699
01:13:05,682 --> 01:13:07,048
Took over.

1700
01:13:07,083 --> 01:13:08,983
I got so excited.

1701
01:13:09,018 --> 01:13:10,785
And the more excited I got,

1702
01:13:10,820 --> 01:13:13,154
the more I wanted to
control everything.

1703
01:13:13,189 --> 01:13:14,622
It was not cool.

1704
01:13:15,658 --> 01:13:17,725
And I completely understand
if you want to start

1705
01:13:17,761 --> 01:13:18,726
your own thing.

1706
01:13:19,963 --> 01:13:22,163
- Whether or not the
show becomes a reality,

1707
01:13:22,198 --> 01:13:25,633
there is no one else I'd
rather be doing this with.

1708
01:13:25,668 --> 01:13:28,469
I'd be 50% less
dynamic without you.

1709
01:13:30,440 --> 01:13:33,975
- Friendship first,
business partner second.

1710
01:13:34,010 --> 01:13:34,942
- You got it.

1711
01:13:36,012 --> 01:13:36,944
Aww.

1712
01:13:41,718 --> 01:13:44,452
- I'd stay and help,
but I got to get back.

1713
01:13:44,487 --> 01:13:46,454
Promised my folks I'd
meet them for dinner.

1714
01:13:46,489 --> 01:13:49,924
- I'll send them my
love. Happy holidays.

1715
01:13:50,794 --> 01:13:51,826
- Bye.
- Bye.

1716
01:13:53,029 --> 01:13:55,129
(sighs)

1717
01:13:56,466 --> 01:13:58,833
- I guess that went well.

1718
01:13:58,868 --> 01:14:00,435
- It did actually.

1719
01:14:00,470 --> 01:14:02,036
(frank yells)

1720
01:14:02,071 --> 01:14:03,104
- dad!

1721
01:14:03,139 --> 01:14:03,938
Dad.

1722
01:14:03,973 --> 01:14:05,039
(frank groans)

1723
01:14:05,074 --> 01:14:06,541
don't move him. Don't move him.

1724
01:14:06,576 --> 01:14:07,475
- Okay. Okay. Are you all right?

1725
01:14:08,378 --> 01:14:09,343
(frank groaning)

1726
01:14:09,379 --> 01:14:10,878
- [911 operator] 911.
What's your emergency?

1727
01:14:10,914 --> 01:14:12,680
- Yeah, we need an
ambulance right away.

1728
01:14:14,684 --> 01:14:15,450
- Okay.

1729
01:14:15,485 --> 01:14:16,717
Okay.

1730
01:14:16,753 --> 01:14:18,753
Yeah. I'll let them know. Okay.

1731
01:14:21,024 --> 01:14:23,491
That was mom. Dad's
going to be fine.

1732
01:14:23,526 --> 01:14:25,726
He fractured his clavicle
and had the wind knocked

1733
01:14:25,762 --> 01:14:27,495
out of him, but no broken ribs.

1734
01:14:28,531 --> 01:14:30,198
- The bright nights committee
said that the deadline

1735
01:14:30,233 --> 01:14:31,132
still stands.

1736
01:14:32,535 --> 01:14:34,635
- We've lost a lot of time.

1737
01:14:34,671 --> 01:14:36,237
- Look, we all know what
we need to accomplish

1738
01:14:36,272 --> 01:14:38,639
and we can only get it
done if we work in harmony

1739
01:14:38,675 --> 01:14:40,107
as one unit,

1740
01:14:40,910 --> 01:14:42,243
as family.

1741
01:14:42,278 --> 01:14:43,177
- Yep.

1742
01:14:44,747 --> 01:14:46,514
- We have to finish
this for frank.

1743
01:14:48,751 --> 01:14:51,719
- Two minutes everyone,
two minutes to show time!

1744
01:14:52,789 --> 01:14:54,188
- Are we good?

1745
01:14:54,224 --> 01:14:55,189
- I think so. I think so.

1746
01:14:55,225 --> 01:14:57,024
- Maybe we should just
check the connections,

1747
01:14:57,060 --> 01:14:57,825
just to be sure.

1748
01:14:57,861 --> 01:14:59,060
- Good idea.
- One last time, right?

1749
01:14:59,095 --> 01:15:00,027
- Yeah.
- Why not?

1750
01:15:02,732 --> 01:15:04,098
What's going on?

1751
01:15:04,133 --> 01:15:05,433
- Come on. It's not
working. It's not working!

1752
01:15:05,468 --> 01:15:07,435
- We tested everything.
It should be fine.

1753
01:15:07,470 --> 01:15:09,837
- 30 seconds to show time!

1754
01:15:09,873 --> 01:15:11,606
- I'll check. I'll check.

1755
01:15:11,641 --> 01:15:15,209

1756
01:15:15,245 --> 01:15:17,078

01:15:17,113 --> 01:15:18,446
- come on.

1758
01:15:18,481 --> 01:15:21,549
Oh my gosh. This
can't be happening.

1759
01:15:23,887 --> 01:15:26,187
- Okay. Okay. Try it.
It should be good.

1760
01:15:26,222 --> 01:15:27,388
All right.

1761
01:15:27,423 --> 01:15:28,289
- [bill] I'll test it one
more time while we have time.

1762
01:15:28,324 --> 01:15:29,357
- Yeah, test it.

1763
01:15:29,392 --> 01:15:30,892
- That's it everybody!

1764
01:15:30,927 --> 01:15:34,262
No more tinkering,
testing, or touch ups .

1765
01:15:34,297 --> 01:15:35,796
- Oh great.

1766
01:15:35,832 --> 01:15:37,431

works until it's our turn.

I gave you a ride

1807
01:20:08,971 --> 01:20:11,105
and I said we were square?

1808
01:20:11,140 --> 01:20:12,339
We weren't.

You move like a snail.

- Bill, you don't want me to
fall off the ladder again,

1820
01:20:48,110 --> 01:20:49,276

1821
01:20:49,312 --> 01:20:50,744

to thank you for hooking me up

01:21:02,258 --> 01:21:04,892
with that restaurant
group in bonaire.

1828
01:21:04,927 --> 01:21:06,260
No, I think I'm going to be
able to turn things around

1829
01:21:06,295 --> 01:21:07,228
for them.

1830
01:21:08,231 --> 01:21:10,898
Hey, can I call you back?
My sister's calling.
