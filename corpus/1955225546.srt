1
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,432
             Man:               
   Look at the size of her!     

2
00:00:43,501 --> 00:00:45,832
      And the skin tone--       
         what a glow.           

3
00:00:45,901 --> 00:00:48,632
It's hard to believe            
she's finally here.             

4
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:50,899
Julia, it's our first,          

5
00:00:50,967 --> 00:00:54,832
       And look at her,         
   she's so soft and cuddly,    

6
00:00:54,901 --> 00:00:56,698
         you just want          
        to squeeze her!         

7
00:00:56,767 --> 00:00:58,432
What a beauty.                  

8
00:00:58,501 --> 00:01:01,132
We've been dreaming             
about this for so long.         

9
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:04,932
         Won't bruise,          
        won't spoil...          

10
00:01:05,001 --> 00:01:07,865
    Genetically improved,       
    resistant to disease...     

11
00:01:07,934 --> 00:01:09,565
             And--              

12
00:01:09,634 --> 00:01:11,665
             Both:              
      They taste better!        

13
00:01:11,734 --> 00:01:13,632
                  You two really
               need to get away.

14
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:16,098
I love you.                     

15
00:01:16,167 --> 00:01:17,532
             Man:               
       All in the wrist.        

16
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,332
                        See?    

17
00:01:22,534 --> 00:01:24,598
          The finger,           
       watch the fing!          

18
00:01:24,667 --> 00:01:26,798
     Nobody wants a finger      
        in their salad.         

19
00:01:26,867 --> 00:01:28,798
      Besides, you might        
        need it one day         

20
00:01:28,867 --> 00:01:30,632
    For a special occasion.     

21
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:31,698
            Hey...              

22
00:01:31,767 --> 00:01:35,399
         Fresh bread,           
       oh, that's good.         

23
00:01:35,467 --> 00:01:41,032
       Don't get bland, come on,
           seasoning, seasoning.

24
00:01:43,867 --> 00:01:45,765
               Let's taste that.

25
00:01:45,834 --> 00:01:49,765
               Oh, that is good,
                     mmm, mmm...

26
00:01:51,467 --> 00:01:53,132
     Now remember, folks,       

27
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,499
      Keep things cooking       
       whilst I'm away.         

28
00:01:55,567 --> 00:01:56,999
                        Leaving?

29
00:01:57,067 --> 00:01:58,465
            Where are you going?

30
00:01:58,534 --> 00:02:00,432
A couple of weeks               
of fun ithe sun                 
with my kids.                   

31
00:02:00,501 --> 00:02:03,032
            Kids? You have kids?

32
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:05,298
Yeah, two of 'em,               
boy and a rl.                   

33
00:02:05,367 --> 00:02:08,365
And they're both                
just like me...                 

34
00:02:08,434 --> 00:02:11,532
Irresistible.                   

35
00:02:13,901 --> 00:02:15,532
                      Mmm...    

36
00:02:20,401 --> 00:02:22,198
            Mmm...              

37
00:02:26,667 --> 00:02:29,332
I have to retake this picture,  
it's horrible.                  

38
00:02:29,401 --> 00:02:31,765
            You can't reta it,  
         we're leaving tomorrow.

39
00:02:31,834 --> 00:02:34,065
People are gonna                
see this, mom.                  

40
00:02:34,134 --> 00:02:36,865
                Who do you think
               works at customs,
                 cindy crawford?

41
00:02:36,934 --> 00:02:38,298
                        Come on.

42
00:02:38,367 --> 00:02:41,465
          I'm excited about th  
                  we're gonna go

43
00:02:41,534 --> 00:02:43,465
    And have the best time      
         in our life.           

44
00:02:43,534 --> 00:02:46,132
       You, thomas, me,         
           russell,             

45
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,399
        We're gonna be          
    on that little island,      

46
00:02:48,467 --> 00:02:49,832
   It's gonna be beautiful!     

47
00:02:49,901 --> 00:02:51,465
   Balboa island is perfect     
         for families.          

48
00:02:51,534 --> 00:02:53,098
We're not a family.             

49
00:02:53,167 --> 00:02:56,965
         Yes, we are.           
      We will be, anay,         

50
00:02:57,034 --> 00:02:59,432
       You just have to         
       get to know him,         
       he's really nice.        

51
00:02:59,501 --> 00:03:01,298
Unless I dress up               
like carrot                     

52
00:03:01,367 --> 00:03:02,565
And max like                    
a piece of lettuce,             

53
00:03:02,634 --> 00:03:04,432
's not even gonna               
notice we're there.             

54
00:03:04,501 --> 00:03:05,765
        That's not true         

55
00:03:05,834 --> 00:03:08,298
          Hello, sweetheart.    

56
00:03:08,367 --> 00:03:09,765
Asparagus.                      

57
00:03:09,834 --> 00:03:11,432
           What? Oh.            

58
00:03:11,501 --> 00:03:14,098
      Hi, kids, I didn't        
        seyou there.            

59
00:03:15,401 --> 00:03:16,798
Now, julia,                     
I just found out                

60
00:03:16,867 --> 00:03:19,098
That the cargo hold             
is not pressurized.             

61
00:03:19,167 --> 00:03:21,999
                    Lucky for us
             we're flying coach.

62
00:03:22,067 --> 00:03:25,265
Yes, well, not all of us        
are samples, remember?          

63
00:03:25,334 --> 00:03:28,332
It's freezing down there,       
they'll never survive.          

64
00:03:28,401 --> 00:03:29,999
            We'll take the crate
            on the plane, right?

65
00:03:30,067 --> 00:03:31,365
Won'fit in the overheads--      
I checked.                      

66
00:03:31,434 --> 00:03:32,932
           What are we gonna do?

67
00:03:33,001 --> 00:03:34,765
              Buy a plane ticket
               for the tomatoes?

68
00:03:34,834 --> 00:03:36,665
              You didn't, right?

69
00:03:36,734 --> 00:03:38,298
I had to.                       

70
00:03:38,367 --> 00:03:39,865
Julia, they're so delicate,     

71
00:03:39,934 --> 00:03:42,532
And then think about            
our corn and our squash,        

72
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,432
And what about                  
our eggplants?                  

73
00:03:44,501 --> 00:03:46,632
You know how temperamental      
they can get.                   

74
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:51,432
Yeah, but the next thing we know
  they're gonna fly first-class.

75
00:03:51,501 --> 00:03:53,532
                        Russell?

76
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,765
                       Russell?!

77
00:03:54,834 --> 00:03:55,632
Coach was booked.               

78
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:57,332
We can't show up                
at the symposium                

79
00:03:57,401 --> 00:03:59,932
With frozen                     
or mashed samples,              

80
00:04:00,001 --> 00:04:03,332
We are finalists for            
the templeton grant.            

81
00:04:04,434 --> 00:04:06,065
                         I know.

82
00:04:06,134 --> 00:04:08,232
                   You're right.

83
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:09,865
Now, that flight is full,       

84
00:04:09,934 --> 00:04:11,465
So they had to put us           
on the next flight.             

85
00:04:11,534 --> 00:04:13,465
                 Are we at least
               sitting together?

86
00:04:13,534 --> 00:04:15,465
Oh, no, I mean, julia,          
I'm sorry,                      

87
00:04:15,534 --> 00:04:18,665
I-I meant that you              
and suh--, um, suh--            

88
00:04:18,734 --> 00:04:20,732
                     We're nna  
            sit together, right?

89
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,465
Yeah, you and the boys          
are gonna still fly tomorrow,   

90
00:04:23,534 --> 00:04:26,332
I meant we...                   
The vegetables and I.           

91
00:05:10,167 --> 00:05:11,965
             Whoa!              

92
00:05:12,034 --> 00:05:13,565
            Loui                

93
00:05:13,634 --> 00:05:15,065
Ha h                            

94
00:05:15,134 --> 00:05:16,732
              I'm gonna get you!

95
00:05:19,034 --> 00:05:20,165
                      Come here!

96
00:05:20,234 --> 00:05:21,832
                          Ha ha!

97
00:05:21,901 --> 00:05:23,765
       ( both laughing )        

98
00:05:25,501 --> 00:05:27,532
             Aah!               

99
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,732
               Stop it, matthew!

100
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,432
               Matthew! Matthew!

101
00:05:33,501 --> 00:05:37,798
     He's been waiting two hours
                for you to come,

102
00:05:37,867 --> 00:05:39,065
              Now that's enough!

103
00:05:39,134 --> 00:05:40,165
Hello...                        

104
00:05:40,234 --> 00:05:41,698
              Oh, no, you don't!

105
00:05:41,767 --> 00:05:43,098
                     Oh, no, no!

106
00:05:44,367 --> 00:05:46,365
 Dad, you're too old for this.  

107
00:05:48,934 --> 00:05:52,265
          And hello to you...   
                 Too!           

108
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:55,298
            Yeah!!!             

109
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,798
Aaahh!                          

110
00:06:00,867 --> 00:06:04,965
                 She sends a few
           every week, you know.

111
00:06:05,034 --> 00:06:06,765
   Yeah, thoughtful of her.     

112
00:06:06,834 --> 00:06:09,598
        A woman audits          
    an anthropology class,      

113
00:06:09,667 --> 00:06:11,598
   Flips for the professor,     
      next thing you know       

114
00:06:11,667 --> 00:06:13,598
        She's living in         
      some cave in peru.        

115
00:06:13,667 --> 00:06:15,598
                 All ght, now,  
        never mind their mother.

116
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:17,598
                    You promised
                      those kids

117
00:06:17,667 --> 00:06:19,332
           You were going to    
        find a bigger place.    

118
00:06:19,401 --> 00:06:22,298
                 I know, I will.
              But I'm takin' '  
                    on vacation.

119
00:06:22,367 --> 00:06:24,765
Well, matthew,                  
showing them a good time        

120
00:06:24,834 --> 00:06:28,499
For two weeks every summer      
is really not enough.           

121
00:06:28,567 --> 00:06:31,265
           They're getting toe  
               too much for you.

122
00:06:31,334 --> 00:06:35,865
No, that's not it--             
they need their father.         

123
00:06:35,934 --> 00:06:38,265
                       ( sighs )
                     listen, ma,

124
00:06:38,334 --> 00:06:40,365
                 Just let me get
              my life organized.

125
00:06:40,434 --> 00:06:43,232
                The restaurant's
                 up and running,

126
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:44,832
               But we're working
              seven days a week,

127
00:06:44,901 --> 00:06:46,499
               Lunch and dinner,
         it's a lot of pressure.

128
00:06:46,567 --> 00:06:49,365
Matthew, what's more important? 

129
00:06:49,434 --> 00:06:51,798
Your job or your kids?          

130
00:06:51,867 --> 00:06:54,632
                 You know I love
               my kids to death.

131
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:57,665
Then why don't you show it      
and be there for them?          

132
00:07:04,834 --> 00:07:06,532
     ( alarm clock rings )      

133
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,798
             Yes!               

134
00:07:12,534 --> 00:07:13,865
          ( snoring )           

135
00:07:26,067 --> 00:07:28,465
     How did so many years      
         of evolution           

136
00:07:28,534 --> 00:07:29,932
     Bypass this one room?      

137
00:07:30,001 --> 00:07:31,765
         ( snorting )           

138
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:39,965
Let's go.                       

139
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,865
      ba-da dee-dee...        

140
00:08:07,001 --> 00:08:09,098
         Merv...Merv!           

141
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:14,165
             Merv!              

142
00:08:15,367 --> 00:08:17,965
           Dumb dog.            

143
00:08:18,034 --> 00:08:20,899
    Doors locked, gas off,      
      alarm timer's on...       

144
00:08:20,967 --> 00:08:23,999
    Passport, keys, wallet.     

145
00:08:24,067 --> 00:08:26,999
        You look tired          
           and pale?            

146
00:08:27,067 --> 00:08:29,098
          Mom, it's five o'clock
                 in the morning.

147
00:08:29,167 --> 00:08:30,165
    Right.                      

148
00:08:30,234 --> 00:08:34,432
Five-oh-three, actually.        
Check your watches.             

149
00:08:34,501 --> 00:08:36,032
           ( beep )             

150
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:38,165
And off we go.                  

151
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:41,965
        ( bell tolls )          

152
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:46,132
        Come on, guys,          
        let get going--         
          we're late!           

153
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,698
We're always late.              

154
00:08:47,767 --> 00:08:49,798
         If dad hadn't          
        slept so long,          
     we wouldn't be late.       

155
00:08:49,867 --> 00:08:51,265
                You did it, too.

156
00:08:51,334 --> 00:08:54,165
Let's get that                  
in there...                     

157
00:08:54,234 --> 00:08:58,165
There...This goes               
over there, like that...        

158
00:08:58,234 --> 00:08:59,832
Be very nice.                   

159
00:08:59,901 --> 00:09:01,832
                  'bye, grandma,
                       love you.

160
00:09:01,901 --> 00:09:03,832
Be very nice,                   
behave beautifully.             

161
00:09:03,901 --> 00:09:04,899
No battling,                    
all right?                      

162
00:09:04,967 --> 00:09:06,899
Okay, ma.                       

163
00:09:06,967 --> 00:09:08,798
Thank you so much.              

164
00:09:08,867 --> 00:09:11,365
Take care now,                  
you hear                        
drive carefully!                

165
00:09:11,434 --> 00:09:13,632
        ( dog barking )         

166
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,698
           The dog--            
       where's the dog?         

167
00:09:15,767 --> 00:09:16,899
             Merv!              

168
00:09:16,967 --> 00:09:19,965
       Come here, merv!         
         Come on, boy!          

169
00:09:20,034 --> 00:09:23,465
                  Come on, merv,
                       let's go.

170
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,365
    ( r & b music playing )     

171
00:09:39,434 --> 00:09:42,432
      bum-bum, bum-bum        

172
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:55,598
                     California.

173
00:09:55,667 --> 00:09:56,632
            Now...              

174
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,598
          Purple hair           
    is one thing, daphne--      

175
00:09:58,667 --> 00:10:00,598
Get your tail                   
out of my face.                 

176
00:10:00,667 --> 00:10:02,932
          But piercing, tattoos,
                     forget it--

177
00:10:03,001 --> 00:10:04,932
        It'lkill your grandma.  

178
00:10:05,001 --> 00:10:08,298
You wouldn't want to            
lose your safety net, right?    

179
00:10:08,367 --> 00:10:11,165
                     I told you,
              I have to do this,

180
00:10:11,234 --> 00:10:12,665
             It's for all of us.

181
00:10:12,734 --> 00:10:15,865
             My kitchen's almost
            working like I want.

182
00:10:15,934 --> 00:10:19,132
              We're all gonna be
                 living together

183
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,165
                   By the end of
                     the summer.

184
00:10:21,234 --> 00:10:23,932
        Oh--vitamin check, boys.

185
00:10:24,001 --> 00:10:26,332
          It's time for a and d.

188
00:10:46,834 --> 00:10:49,765
        It won't be much longer.

189
00:10:49,834 --> 00:10:52,399
It's now...Oh!                  

190
00:10:52,467 --> 00:10:55,432
Oh, we forget to                
turn our watches back,          

191
00:10:55,501 --> 00:10:56,665
It's nine hours difference.     

192
00:10:56,734 --> 00:11:00,399
It's now eleven-thirty eight.   

193
00:11:00,467 --> 00:11:02,798
Synchronize your watches.       

194
00:11:03,934 --> 00:11:06,932
     Dad, it's real slow,       
       three at a time.

         Look at that!          
What are his parents thinking?  

196
00:11:11,934 --> 00:11:15,499
   Come on, louis, come on.     

197
00:11:15,567 --> 00:11:17,965
                    Louis! Argh!

198
00:11:18,034 --> 00:11:20,165
        Let's go, dad.          

199
00:11:21,834 --> 00:11:22,932

     ( tires screeching )       

201
00:11:24,334 --> 00:11:25,598
Dad, what are you doing?!       

202
00:11:25,667 --> 00:11:28,265

205
00:11:44,267 --> 00:11:45,465
Mom...                          

206
00:11:49,634 --> 00:11:51,432
                   Are you nuts?

207
00:11:51,501 --> 00:11:54,265
What? You wait                  
your turn, mister.              

208
00:11:54,334 --> 00:11:57,432
You wait your turn              
like all the rest of us.        

209
00:11:57,501 --> 00:11:59,365
    I am waiting--you're the one
              holding us up now.

210
00:11:59,434 --> 00:12:00,632
          Hey, move!            

211
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:01,865
I'll move when                  
I'm ready to move!              

212
00:12:01,934 --> 00:12:03,932
Before you. First.              

213
00:12:06,001 --> 00:12:08,432
            Woman:              
        Come on, lady!          

214
00:12:08,501 --> 00:12:11,399
You know, it's selfish,         
ckless drivers like you--       

215
00:12:11,467 --> 00:12:14,232
Is this how you                 
drive in america?               

216
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:16,865
Don't you know decency,         
don't you know respect?         

217
00:12:16,934 --> 00:12:18,899
                     Okay, lady,
                cut the lecture.

218
00:12:18,967 --> 00:12:20,798
                          Drive.

219
00:12:20,867 --> 00:12:22,665
Not till you apologize.         

220
00:12:22,734 --> 00:12:24,132
                      What?!    

221
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:27,032
To me and all                   
the other drivers               
whose turn you stole.           

222
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:28,365
               ( horns blaring )
                    take a hike.

223
00:12:32,967 --> 00:12:35,832
                All right, lady,
                 five seconds...

224
00:12:37,734 --> 00:12:40,298
             Or I smash your car
                 out of the way.

225
00:12:40,367 --> 00:12:41,865
                      One...    

226
00:12:44,434 --> 00:12:46,132
Come on, merv,                  
get in the back.                

227
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,465
                      Two...    

228
00:12:49,834 --> 00:12:51,698
                        Three...

229
00:12:53,634 --> 00:12:55,198
                         Four...

230
00:12:57,467 --> 00:12:59,032
             Five.              

231
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:00,565
All right,                      
I'll move,                      

232
00:13:00,634 --> 00:13:02,065
Because I                       
want to move.                   

233
00:13:03,934 --> 00:13:05,332
To prevent further delay.       

234
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:11,265
                    What a loon.

235
00:13:17,001 --> 00:13:18,332
             Arf!               

236
00:13:20,867 --> 00:13:23,098
Stop!                           

237
00:13:23,167 --> 00:13:25,399
          Next boat,            
          we're full.           

238
00:13:25,467 --> 00:13:26,465
              What?!            

239
00:13:28,134 --> 00:13:29,132
              Aah...            

240
00:14:07,367 --> 00:14:09,465
One-twenty...                   
Ahead of schedule,              

241
00:14:09,534 --> 00:14:12,032
We made excellent time.         
Look at that!                   

242
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:18,232
         That's ours--          
           all ours.            

243
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:21,032
   We can hike, bike, swim--    

244
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,399
Sail?                           
           Sail.                

245
00:14:32,834 --> 00:14:34,165
        Come on, kids.          

246
00:14:39,434 --> 00:14:41,332
                 Come on, louis.

247
00:14:41,401 --> 00:14:42,499
                           Merv.
           Merv!                

248
00:14:42,567 --> 00:14:44,065
                  Come on, daph.

249
00:14:44,134 --> 00:14:45,365
                  Come on, daph,

250
00:14:45,434 --> 00:14:47,865
          We start our vacation,
                 it's tradition!

251
00:14:47,934 --> 00:14:49,532
         A sacred family ritual.

252
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,399
        We can free our spirits,
              cleanse our souls,

253
00:14:52,467 --> 00:14:53,899
       Wash off the daily grind!

254
00:14:53,967 --> 00:14:56,265
Can't we just unpack            
or something?                   

255
00:14:56,334 --> 00:14:58,798
         Come on, dad,          
    she doesn't want to go.     

256
00:14:58,867 --> 00:14:59,565
           Let's go.            

257
00:14:59,634 --> 00:15:01,698
               Okay, find. 'bye!

258
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:07,499
           Aaahhh!!             

259
00:15:07,567 --> 00:15:09,165
                 We're going in!

260
00:15:10,734 --> 00:15:12,265
                We're going in!!

261
00:15:13,967 --> 00:15:17,065
 mr. Cupid's in a funny mood  

262
00:15:17,134 --> 00:15:20,598
 wait till he makes his move  

263
00:15:20,667 --> 00:15:23,965
  maybe we could get together  
        all the same           

264
00:15:24,034 --> 00:15:26,565
          sunshine            

265
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:28,432
       and summer days        

266
00:15:28,501 --> 00:15:30,765
          sunshine            

267
00:15:30,834 --> 00:15:33,565
       and summer days        

268
00:15:33,634 --> 00:15:36,265
          sunshine            

269
00:15:36,334 --> 00:15:38,365
       and summer days        

270
00:15:38,434 --> 00:15:40,865
        all those days         
      that pass you by         

271
00:15:40,934 --> 00:15:44,032
       all those nights        
      that pass you by         

272
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:45,765
                         Daphne:
           What are we gonna do?

273
00:15:54,501 --> 00:15:57,232
     Do I love this place!      

274
00:15:59,167 --> 00:16:01,165
            Ahh...              

275
00:16:04,967 --> 00:16:06,132
            Louis:              
           Shut up.             

276
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,465
Daphne:                         
Here, louis,                    
take your backpack.             

277
00:16:08,534 --> 00:16:12,499
      Dad, can we just break in?
       'cause I really gotta go.

278
00:16:12,567 --> 00:16:14,598
I gave you the key.             

279
00:16:14,667 --> 00:16:16,098
      This is so typical.       

280
00:16:16,167 --> 00:16:18,465
         Why isn't it           
        on your chain?          

281
00:16:18,534 --> 00:16:20,265
What chain?                     

282
00:16:20,334 --> 00:16:22,798
   You need to get a chain,     
 'cause this is why it's lost.  

283
00:16:22,867 --> 00:16:25,565
         Dad, I really gotta go!

284
00:16:27,467 --> 00:16:29,399
Maybe there's                   
a window open.                  

285
00:16:29,467 --> 00:16:30,832
                       ( sighs )
              I'll keep looking.

286
00:16:45,001 --> 00:16:47,232
      ( sigh of relief )        

287
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,832
                      Ahh...    

288
00:16:50,367 --> 00:16:51,399
             Aah!               

289
00:16:51,467 --> 00:16:52,865
             Aah!               

290
00:16:52,934 --> 00:16:55,465
       Thomas, did you see him?!

291
00:16:56,634 --> 00:16:59,465
    Mom, they're after us!      

292
00:16:59,534 --> 00:17:01,098
What? What is it?               

293
00:17:01,167 --> 00:17:02,832
                     She's here!
                   In the house!

294
00:17:05,401 --> 00:17:07,232
               See? Right there!

295
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:08,365
          What the--            

296
00:17:08,434 --> 00:17:09,899
Oh, my god.                     

297
00:17:09,967 --> 00:17:11,798
      That's that lunatic       
        from the ferry!         

298
00:17:11,867 --> 00:17:14,565
           You! Hey!            

299
00:17:14,634 --> 00:17:15,598
          Hey, lady!            

300
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:17,265
      I know you're mad,        

301
00:17:17,334 --> 00:17:19,198
      I know you're angry       
     you missed the ferry,      

302
00:17:19,267 --> 00:17:20,798
     But you're here now,       
        okay? So relax.         

303
00:17:20,867 --> 00:17:23,965
  I don't know that you think   
    you're doing in there,      

304
00:17:24,034 --> 00:17:27,465
        But you are in          
     some serious trouble!      

305
00:17:27,534 --> 00:17:30,798
    Open up is door--now!       

306
00:17:30,867 --> 00:17:33,132
      You open this door        
    or I'll break it down!      

307
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,298
       I'll not tolerate        
         any violence.          

308
00:17:38,134 --> 00:17:40,432
       I have a weapon--        
          step back!            

309
00:17:40,501 --> 00:17:42,765
       I'll use it, too,        
           now shoo!            

310
00:17:42,834 --> 00:17:43,865
                     "shoo"?    

311
00:17:43,934 --> 00:17:45,365
That's right,                   
leave us alone!                 

312
00:17:45,434 --> 00:17:48,732
This is my house!!              
                           Yeah!

313
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,098
Your house? Ha!                 

314
00:17:51,167 --> 00:17:52,565
            Right--             

315
00:17:52,634 --> 00:17:54,798
         That does it!          

316
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,165
Then use your key!              

317
00:17:57,234 --> 00:17:58,565
                  Good one, mom.

318
00:17:58,634 --> 00:18:02,365
     I can't find my key!!      

319
00:18:02,434 --> 00:18:04,399
Don't make me hurt you!         

320
00:18:04,467 --> 00:18:07,298
    What are you gonna do,      
       lob me to death?!        

321
00:18:07,367 --> 00:18:09,065
This is trespassing!            

322
00:18:09,134 --> 00:18:11,965
Okay? It's breaking             
and entering!                   

323
00:18:12,034 --> 00:18:13,365
It's harassment!                

324
00:18:13,434 --> 00:18:16,832
     Yes, and with good behavior
     you might be out in a year.

325
00:18:16,901 --> 00:18:20,832
Me? Well, we belong here,       
because we have keys!           

326
00:18:20,901 --> 00:18:22,098
Daddy.                          

327
00:18:22,167 --> 00:18:23,965
        Well, so do we!         

328
00:18:24,034 --> 00:18:25,032
              Ha!               

329
00:18:27,401 --> 00:18:28,999
            And.                

330
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:32,232
           It fits.             

331
00:18:33,534 --> 00:18:35,232
             See?               

332
00:18:38,001 --> 00:18:40,232
            Woman:              
           Come on,             
     don't worry about it.      

333
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:41,832
    They're right in there.     

334
00:18:46,967 --> 00:18:49,098
    ( all talking at once )     

335
00:18:49,167 --> 00:18:51,732
           This is just a simple
       misunderstanding, really.

336
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,732
     I rented the house to you--

337
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:54,665
             Yes.               

338
00:18:54,734 --> 00:18:56,698
    And then I leased it to you.

339
00:18:56,767 --> 00:18:59,098
      Yes--the software,        
     just a few glitches.       

340
00:18:59,167 --> 00:19:02,698
We love this house              
and we were alreadmoved in.     

341
00:19:02,767 --> 00:19:04,932
            You moved in because
    you cut us off at the ferry.

342
00:19:05,001 --> 00:19:06,932
You cut a whole row off         
at the ferry.                   

343
00:19:07,001 --> 00:19:11,532
 I rent this house for two weeks
        every summer--it's mine.

344
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,232
Oh, really?                     
Well, I happen to have          

345
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:15,798
A fully executed                
rental agreement.               

346
00:19:15,867 --> 00:19:17,298
I have one of those, too.       

347
00:19:17,367 --> 00:19:21,265
Not on me, or...                
Hermetically sealed in plastic. 

348
00:19:22,767 --> 00:19:25,765
What about the deposit?         
I sent in a wire transfer--     

349
00:19:25,834 --> 00:19:27,432
Dihe pay?                       
I bet he didn't pay.            

350
00:19:27,501 --> 00:19:28,698
       Of course I paid!        

351
00:19:28,767 --> 00:19:29,698
           Didn't I?            

352
00:19:29,767 --> 00:19:31,565
     Let me see...              

353
00:19:31,634 --> 00:19:33,798
            Let's take a look...

354
00:19:33,867 --> 00:19:37,665
 Yes, we received your check,   
   mr. Fariker, on the 10th.    

355
00:19:37,734 --> 00:19:42,732
      Oh, we redeposited        
for lack of funds on the 13th,  

356
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:45,698
  And received miss weeland's   
     transfer on the 14th,      

357
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:50,798
      So I suppose then,        
        technically...          

358
00:19:50,867 --> 00:19:52,032
But that's not fair.            

359
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:53,965
      Sorry, sweetheart.        

360
00:19:54,034 --> 00:19:56,932
         Take it easy,          
       they'll find you         
        somewhere else.         

361
00:19:57,001 --> 00:19:58,098
                     Well, wait.

362
00:19:58,167 --> 00:19:59,965
             See, that's kind of
              impossible because

363
00:20:00,034 --> 00:20:01,332
     The whole island is booked.

364
00:20:01,401 --> 00:20:04,132
Booked? What--                  
what do you mean, booked?       

365
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,499
     Oh, yes, every room,       

366
00:20:06,567 --> 00:20:08,499
     Every inn, every bed       
        and breakfast--         

367
00:20:08,567 --> 00:20:10,032
     It's our busy season.      

368
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:11,732
                           Busy.
          Busy.                 

369
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,499
Too bad, we've already          
moved in here                   

370
00:20:13,567 --> 00:20:15,598
And we're not                   
going anywhere.                 

371
00:20:15,667 --> 00:20:16,732
         Yes, you are.          

372
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,598
No, we're not.                  

373
00:20:18,667 --> 00:20:22,365
 I mean, really perfect, dad,   
   they're total strangers.     

374
00:20:22,434 --> 00:20:24,532
            You think I like it?

375
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,532
     What are we supposed to do?
            Evict them by force?

376
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,932
Yeah!                           
                           Yeah?

377
00:20:28,001 --> 00:20:29,465
            Look it's only for--

378
00:20:29,534 --> 00:20:30,598
         --One night.           

379
00:20:30,634 --> 00:20:32,565
 We'll keep our doors locked,   

380
00:20:32,634 --> 00:20:34,265
And they'll find ather place    
        in the morning.         

381
00:20:34,334 --> 00:20:35,899
       Like they're gonna leave.

382
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:36,999
I hate this vacation!           

383
00:20:37,067 --> 00:20:38,399
           ( sighs )            
             okay.              

384
00:20:43,667 --> 00:20:44,932
                      Excuse us.

385
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:48,532
                      Excuse me.

386
00:20:55,367 --> 00:20:57,999
The produce is beautifully      
displayed in your country,      

387
00:20:58,067 --> 00:21:01,032
But what are these?             
Golfballs?                      

388
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:02,732
                No, they're just
                   not ripe yet.

389
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,765
             When they do ripen,
              they turn to mush.

390
00:21:04,834 --> 00:21:06,832
        You should see          
         my tomatoes.           

391
00:21:06,901 --> 00:21:08,198
I'd love to see                 
your tomatoes.                  

392
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:10,432
What? She gets to               
see 'em and not me?             

393
00:21:10,501 --> 00:21:12,932
I live with the woman,          
and she won't show me           
her vegetables.                 

394
00:21:13,001 --> 00:21:14,698
                   I do not live
               with this person.

395
00:21:14,767 --> 00:21:16,465
          I merely share a space
                 withis family  

396
00:21:16,534 --> 00:21:18,865
                For a very, very
         limited amount of time.

397
00:21:18,934 --> 00:21:20,832
No, I've generously agreed      

398
00:21:20,901 --> 00:21:22,832
To keep them off the street     
for a night.                    

399
00:21:22,901 --> 00:21:23,999
                           Hmph.

400
00:21:24,067 --> 00:21:26,265
So what's so special            
about your tomatoes, huh?       

401
00:21:26,334 --> 00:21:30,298
                  Redder, riper,
                      juicier...

402
00:21:30,367 --> 00:21:31,765
Green thumb?                    

403
00:21:31,834 --> 00:21:33,298
             Ph.D.              

404
00:21:33,367 --> 00:21:34,298
In tomatoes?                    

405
00:21:34,367 --> 00:21:36,365
What do you minor in,           
brussels sprouts?               

406
00:21:36,434 --> 00:21:39,399
             No, my degree is in
            genetic engineering.

407
00:21:39,467 --> 00:21:42,198
Oh, franken-fruits,             
fish genes in the tomatoes.     

408
00:21:42,267 --> 00:21:45,665
Bunch of radioactive vegetables 
souped up in a lab, huh?        

409
00:21:45,734 --> 00:21:48,999
                 There's nothing
         radioactive about them.

410
00:21:49,067 --> 00:21:51,598
            Better than anything
   you'd ever put in your salad.

411
00:21:51,667 --> 00:21:52,698
Listen, sweetheart,             

412
00:21:52,767 --> 00:21:54,198
You trone of my salads,         

413
00:21:54,267 --> 00:21:55,632
You'll think you died           
and gone to heaven.             

414
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:57,598
   Really? What are you, a chef?

415
00:21:57,667 --> 00:21:58,899
Yeah.                           

416
00:21:58,967 --> 00:22:01,832
      Burger king or mcdonald's?

417
00:22:09,401 --> 00:22:13,032
            Woman:              
   Checkstand 5 is now open,    
  no waiting at checkstand 5.   

418
00:22:19,934 --> 00:22:20,798
       Are you together?        

419
00:22:20,867 --> 00:22:22,298
         No!                 No!
No!                  No!        

420
00:22:22,367 --> 00:22:24,032
         Who's first?           

421
00:22:26,834 --> 00:22:28,198
          Let's get these things
                 out of the car.

422
00:22:28,267 --> 00:22:29,265
                            Aah!

423
00:22:35,567 --> 00:22:37,499
                        Louis...

424
00:22:37,567 --> 00:22:39,532
        Thanks, daphne.         

425
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,432
      Here's one for you,       

426
00:22:40,501 --> 00:22:42,565
              Some for us...    

427
00:22:42,634 --> 00:22:45,499
          Come on, let's go.    

428
00:22:56,467 --> 00:22:58,132
                         Daphne:
        Dad, watch your fingers.

429
00:22:59,934 --> 00:23:03,899
         Lovely fresh parsley...

430
00:23:07,634 --> 00:23:09,132
           Ha ha ha!            

431
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,999
           Ha ha ha!            

432
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,999
       Perfect, perfect.        

433
00:23:16,067 --> 00:23:19,432
       Now...Hot, hot...        

434
00:23:19,501 --> 00:23:22,965
     Oh, smell it, this is      
      going to be superb.       

435
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:26,165
     Are you expecting applause?

436
00:23:27,501 --> 00:23:29,899
   It's all in the balance,     
           you know.            

437
00:23:29,967 --> 00:23:34,565
         I'll tell you          
   something about applause.    

438
00:23:34,634 --> 00:23:36,032
    Smell, smell, smell...      

439
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:37,365
            Mmm....             

440
00:23:37,434 --> 00:23:39,032
         You can tell           
          a whole lot           

441
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:41,399
        About a person          
     by the way they cook.      

442
00:23:41,467 --> 00:23:43,565
          Bon appetit.          

443
00:23:45,534 --> 00:23:47,065
Ha ha!                          

444
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:49,999
After dinner we have to sit down
        and make some schedules.

445
00:23:50,067 --> 00:23:51,598
Schedules?!                     

446
00:23:51,667 --> 00:23:54,798
   Yeah, for cooking and cleanup
           and showers and such.

447
00:23:54,867 --> 00:23:56,932
Lady, you're only               
gonna be here one night.        

448
00:23:57,001 --> 00:24:00,365
            No, you're only here
                  for one night,

449
00:24:00,434 --> 00:24:02,932
           And I want everything
                in perfect order

450
00:24:03,001 --> 00:24:04,465
       For when russellrrives.  

451
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:12,298
Tell me russell                 
is a turtle...                  

452
00:24:12,367 --> 00:24:15,232
Or a small hamster.             

453
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:16,465
Close.                          

454
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,632
          Russell's my colleague
                  and my fiance,

455
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:22,999
     And he's arriving tomorrow.

456
00:24:23,067 --> 00:24:24,698
That's when                     
the real fun starts.            

457
00:24:24,767 --> 00:24:26,965
            Ha ha!              

458
00:24:27,034 --> 00:24:29,999
We've got an uptight            
german dude coming?!            

459
00:24:31,267 --> 00:24:33,198
Actually, he's an uptight       
american dude.                  

460
00:24:33,267 --> 00:24:34,598
                  That's enough.

461
00:24:35,734 --> 00:24:38,065
                 Russell daniels
                  is a brilliant
                      scientist,

462
00:24:38,134 --> 00:24:40,165
               And a very decent
                    human being,

463
00:24:40,234 --> 00:24:41,499
         And fortunately for me,

464
00:24:41,567 --> 00:24:43,632
             Both professionally
                 and personally,

465
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:46,399
        He's part of an exchange
              program in munich.

466
00:24:46,467 --> 00:24:48,698
All beverages included?         

467
00:24:48,767 --> 00:24:50,065
                      Excuse me?

468
00:24:50,134 --> 00:24:52,632
It may be the language barrier, 

469
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:55,032
But you soun                    
just like a brochure.           

470
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:57,332
Well, our english is excellent--

471
00:24:57,401 --> 00:24:59,632
       Their father is american.

472
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:01,465
And you...                      

473
00:25:01,534 --> 00:25:04,132
Guess you might have a thing    
for english-speaking guys, huh? 

474
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:08,198
     You'll never make it across
        this border, believe me.

475
00:25:08,267 --> 00:25:10,432
Ha ha ha!                       

476
00:25:15,434 --> 00:25:16,899
                  Don't mind me,

477
00:25:16,967 --> 00:25:18,665
               I'm just going to
                   wedge in here

478
00:25:18,734 --> 00:25:21,899
               On this amazingly
                 rock-like sofa.

479
00:25:21,967 --> 00:25:23,732
I called heads.                 

480
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:26,065
      ( car horn honks )        

481
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:35,565
       ( rao blaring )          

482
00:25:37,667 --> 00:25:38,932
           Matthe               

483
00:25:39,001 --> 00:25:40,232
            Felice!             

484
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:42,265
        How are you, sweetheart?
           I knew you'd be here!

485
00:25:42,334 --> 00:25:44,532
Delighted, for                  
the first time all day.         

486
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:45,932
I'll be right down.             

487
00:25:46,001 --> 00:25:47,899
             Okay.              

488
00:25:49,334 --> 00:25:50,798
      ( turns radio off )       

489
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:03,265
                Wow...          
              Who's that?       

490
00:26:03,334 --> 00:26:04,798
    It's felice.                

491
00:26:04,867 --> 00:26:06,865
    I thought she               
    got married.                

492
00:26:06,934 --> 00:26:09,032
    ( sighs )                   

493
00:26:16,401 --> 00:26:18,165
                         Felice:
         Same old story, though,

494
00:26:18,234 --> 00:26:19,899
                 You know, first
             he's madly in love,

495
00:26:19,967 --> 00:26:23,732
 Then daddy mentioned that nasty
       little word "prenuptial,"

496
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,732
           And things cooled off
                   considerably.

497
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:28,132
           Makes a woman wonder,

498
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,798
         Was he in love with me,
             or my mutual funds?

499
00:26:30,867 --> 00:26:33,565
Well, for me, it's you, fece.   

500
00:26:33,634 --> 00:26:37,232
It's always been you.           

501
00:26:41,901 --> 00:26:43,899
                  Oh, you should
                   have told me.

502
00:26:43,967 --> 00:26:47,365
No, it's not what you think,    
not what you think at all.      

503
00:26:50,367 --> 00:26:52,065
                 You wanna cook?

504
00:26:52,134 --> 00:26:54,499
You had to ask?                 

505
00:27:01,334 --> 00:27:02,832
        ( starts car )          

506
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:38,098
                     Good night.

507
00:27:42,067 --> 00:27:43,232
       'night, darling.         

508
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:46,499
     Oh, and don't forget       
        daddy's party.          

509
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:52,132
           ( sighs )            

510
00:28:09,634 --> 00:28:11,865
          Psst! Daph!           

511
00:28:13,067 --> 00:28:16,365
         Daph! Louis!           

512
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:20,732
           ( sighs )            

513
00:28:48,867 --> 00:28:49,665
                           Merv?

514
00:28:51,367 --> 00:28:53,532
                    Hee hee hee!

515
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,665
Julia:                          
Russell,                        

516
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:59,965
Do you know what I              
really, really want to do?      

517
00:29:00,034 --> 00:29:04,598
    Oh, russell, make love.     

518
00:29:04,667 --> 00:29:08,798
      I want to make love       
        in the dunes...         

519
00:29:08,867 --> 00:29:10,065
You do?                         

520
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:14,565
And the surf...                 

521
00:29:18,567 --> 00:29:20,865
Again and again...              

522
00:29:20,934 --> 00:29:22,932
    Again?                      

523
00:29:23,001 --> 00:29:25,465
         And again...           

524
00:29:25,534 --> 00:29:27,298
    Mmm...                      

525
00:29:30,734 --> 00:29:33,065
         ( sniffing )           

526
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:36,032
           Russell?             

527
00:29:37,434 --> 00:29:38,899
             Aahh!              

528
00:29:40,834 --> 00:29:42,365
                           Aahh!

529
00:29:42,934 --> 00:29:45,132

00:29:47,234 --> 00:29:48,598

532
00:30:07,767 --> 00:30:09,798

533
00:30:09,867 --> 00:30:11,465
        ( door closes )         

534
00:30:12,334 --> 00:30:14,765

00:30:48,834 --> 00:30:50,665
                I'm in love with
                    your fiance.

545
00:30:50,734 --> 00:30:51,665
Ugh!                            

546
00:30:51,734 --> 00:30:53,098
         I know it sounds crazy,

547
00:30:53,167 --> 00:30:54,832
                 I know it comes
                     as a shock,

548
00:30:54,901 --> 00:30:56,432
       But one night with that--

549
00:30:56,501 --> 00:30:58,198

                    to tell you.

               That'sll right,  
                    that's okay.

613
00:33:26,734 --> 00:33:28,698
    I'm just gonna...Yeah.      

614
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:39,932
    well, I feel so good      

615
00:33:40,001 --> 00:33:41,665
That dog just                   
took my hat!                    

616
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:45,265
       He smells! Beast.        

617
00:33:45,334 --> 00:33:47,365
                Don't talk about
       your boyfriend like that.

618
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:49,832
             Whoa!              

619
00:33:51,967 --> 00:33:53,298
            Sorry.              

620
00:34:05,501 --> 00:34:07,499
             Ahhh!              

621
00:34:07,567 --> 00:34:09,132
Ha ha ha!                       

622
00:34:11,667 --> 00:34:13,265
                  Are you crazy?

623
00:34:13,334 --> 00:34:15,932
Are you okay, honey?            

624
00:34:18,434 --> 00:34:21,298
Thomas, my friend,              
you've got a choice.            

625
00:34:21,367 --> 00:34:23,732
Spend your life memorizing,     
or take a chance.               

626
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,399
Go on, talk to her!             

627
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:28,098
        Looking is a lot easier.

628
00:34:30,067 --> 00:34:31,999
Do you want to                  
go for a ride?                  

629
00:34:32,067 --> 00:34:33,265
Come on!                        

630
00:34:33,334 --> 00:34:34,065
                            Dad!

631
00:34:34,134 --> 00:34:35,765
             Dad!               

632
00:34:38,167 --> 00:34:39,499
           Russell:             
          Oh, my hat!           

633
00:34:39,567 --> 00:34:41,598
    Is that pride and prejudice?

634
00:34:41,667 --> 00:34:43,232
    Yeah.                       

635
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:44,765
               I love that book.

636
00:34:44,834 --> 00:34:46,098
Me, too.                        

637
00:34:46,167 --> 00:34:48,198
                  I readt when  
                 I was your age.

638
00:34:48,267 --> 00:34:49,465
Oh, really?                     

639
00:34:49,534 --> 00:34:52,798
I'm only halfway through it,    
but it's an excellent book.     

640
00:34:56,901 --> 00:34:58,899
      It's such a beautiful day.

641
00:35:04,467 --> 00:35:05,665
    Hey.                        

642
00:35:09,067 --> 00:35:10,465
                Come on, thomas.

643
00:35:10,534 --> 00:35:13,698
Um, actually, I've never        
rode a horse before.            

644
00:35:13,767 --> 00:35:16,499
              No problem, kiddo,
  the sand will break your fall.

645
00:35:27,867 --> 00:35:29,499
                  You all right?
Yeah.                           

646
00:35:32,834 --> 00:35:34,098
            Thomas!             

647
00:35:35,667 --> 00:35:37,999
       Get down! Thomas!        

648
00:35:38,067 --> 00:35:39,065
            Omas!               

649
00:35:40,867 --> 00:35:42,965
Get down from that horse!       

650
00:35:43,034 --> 00:35:45,732
           Mom, we're just going
   for a ride, it's no big deal.

651
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,932
You don't know                  
how to ride a horse.            

652
00:35:48,001 --> 00:35:49,899
           It's time he learned.

653
00:35:49,967 --> 00:35:50,999
Not here, it isn't.             

654
00:35:51,067 --> 00:35:52,732
If you want lessons,            
you can take real lessons,      

655
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,132
From a proper instructor.       

656
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:56,332
          It's no big deal, mom,
      we're riding on the beach.

657
00:35:56,401 --> 00:35:58,865
All we need right now           
is for you to fall              

658
00:35:58,934 --> 00:36:00,865
And crack your head open,       
get down.                       

659
00:36:00,934 --> 00:36:03,399
       He's real gentle,        
   you don't have to worry.     

660
00:36:03,467 --> 00:36:04,798
           You hear that, julia?

661
00:36:04,867 --> 00:36:07,565
     Thomas, it's gonna be fine.

662
00:36:07,634 --> 00:36:10,798
Thomas, get down.               

663
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:16,198
             Now!               

664
00:36:21,067 --> 00:36:23,899
  You made me look like an idiot
           in front of everyone.

665
00:36:23,967 --> 00:36:24,932
Thomas--                        

666
00:36:25,001 --> 00:36:26,032
                            Mom.

667
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:29,032
      Just leave me alone, okay?

668
00:36:41,267 --> 00:36:43,899
Julia:                          
They survived the trip          
beautifully.                    

669
00:36:43,967 --> 00:36:45,698
           Yes, indeed they did.

670
00:36:45,767 --> 00:36:48,565
             Oh, would you look?

671
00:36:48,634 --> 00:36:52,198
             Look at the curves,
        look at the proportions.

672
00:36:52,267 --> 00:36:54,832
        Not too shabby.         

673
00:36:54,901 --> 00:36:56,165
                        Wow!    

674
00:36:56,234 --> 00:37:00,632
                 This would make
          one awesome parmigian.

675
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:03,399
        Oh, no, no, no.         

676
00:37:03,467 --> 00:37:05,399
        These eggplants         
     will never be cooked.      

677
00:37:05,467 --> 00:37:06,798
     We're presenting him,      

678
00:37:06,867 --> 00:37:08,798
       Along with all of        
      the other samples,        

679
00:37:08,867 --> 00:37:11,698
 At the genetic botanical arts  
  symposium in san francisco.   

680
00:37:11,767 --> 00:37:14,532
                Wow! Can I still
           get tickets for that?

681
00:37:15,967 --> 00:37:17,698
       I....Don't know!         

682
00:37:17,767 --> 00:37:21,932
     But we are finalists       
for the symposium grand prize.  

683
00:37:22,001 --> 00:37:24,899
       Is that like the pulitzer
                  for fake food?

684
00:37:24,967 --> 00:37:26,499
          Fake food?            

685
00:37:26,567 --> 00:37:30,598
You can make your little cracks 
about our work,                 

686
00:37:30,667 --> 00:37:32,098
But let me tell you,            

687
00:37:32,167 --> 00:37:33,698
Whatever stunts you pull        
on this island is your business,

688
00:37:33,767 --> 00:37:35,698
Just leave my boys              
out of it.                      

689
00:37:35,767 --> 00:37:38,265
                   This is about
        the horse riding, right?

690
00:37:38,334 --> 00:37:42,365
            Julia, you gotta let
        your kids have some fun.

691
00:37:42,434 --> 00:37:43,532
Excuse me?                      

692
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:45,632
                    Both o'em.  
                Let 'em breathe.

693
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:47,298
          You're smothering 'em!

694
00:37:47,367 --> 00:37:51,198
Oh, like your children,         
letting them run wd.            

695
00:37:51,267 --> 00:37:53,065
                    My kids know
                    spontaneity.

696
00:37:53,134 --> 00:37:54,732
So do mine.                     

697
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,798
Within a certain                
safe structure.                 

698
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:59,965
            Now, please, please,
                    settle down,

699
00:38:00,034 --> 00:38:03,265
         Everyone has his or her
         own style of parenting.

700
00:38:03,334 --> 00:38:06,698
        What's yours, professor?

701
00:38:06,767 --> 00:38:08,565
                 You're gonna be
                  a parent soon.

702
00:38:12,401 --> 00:38:14,098
Well, you...                    

703
00:38:14,167 --> 00:38:17,465
I'm sure russell                
will impart                     
the same wisdom                 

704
00:38:17,534 --> 00:38:19,465
And resourcefulness             
he shows in the lab.            

705
00:38:19,534 --> 00:38:23,399
          Ha ha! I bet the party
      never stops at your house.

706
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:25,465
        Oh, thank you.          

707
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:38,598
         ( grunting )           

708
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:00,965
              Oh!               

709
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:06,132
                         No!    

710
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:07,432
                     My eye!    

711
00:39:07,501 --> 00:39:09,499
                 Ow! My eye!    

712
00:39:09,567 --> 00:39:10,865
                     My eye!    

713
00:39:10,934 --> 00:39:12,365
               Look what you    
              did to my eye!    

714
00:39:12,434 --> 00:39:13,698
    Ah!                         

715
00:39:13,767 --> 00:39:14,765
                         Ha!    

716
00:39:16,634 --> 00:39:18,432
Let me see that.                

717
00:39:21,934 --> 00:39:23,332
Find any?                       

718
00:39:23,401 --> 00:39:25,399
Chest hairs.                    
I saw you looking.              

719
00:39:25,467 --> 00:39:27,798
I did the same thing            
with my boobs.                  

720
00:39:27,867 --> 00:39:29,865
            No luck either, huh?

721
00:39:34,467 --> 00:39:36,365
    Wow...                      

722
00:39:36,434 --> 00:39:38,932
You mean your dad               
makes these?                    

723
00:39:39,001 --> 00:39:41,832
               Yeah, he sends me
            the ones with flaws.

724
00:39:41,901 --> 00:39:44,665
                 See, this one's
                 almost perfect,

725
00:39:44,734 --> 00:39:46,598
               Just a tiny crack
                    in the iris.

726
00:39:46,667 --> 00:39:48,932
Bitchen.                        

727
00:39:49,001 --> 00:39:51,965
What do you mean,               
he sends you them?              

728
00:39:52,034 --> 00:39:54,065
     He lives in california now.

729
00:39:54,134 --> 00:39:57,865
Yeah, my mom                    
lives in peru.                  

730
00:39:57,934 --> 00:40:00,065
                           Peru?

731
00:40:00,134 --> 00:40:02,499
Yeah, she's on                  
an expedition.                  

732
00:40:02,567 --> 00:40:04,399
She sends me gifts              
that she digs up,               

733
00:40:04,467 --> 00:40:07,132
Like last time she sent         
this really cool statue.        

734
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:08,198
                        Bitchen.

735
00:40:10,867 --> 00:40:13,365
Yeah, I guess it is.            

736
00:40:16,734 --> 00:40:18,999
And I thought                   
you were mad at me.             

737
00:40:19,067 --> 00:40:22,632
    Please. This is for russell.

738
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:23,765
Russell?!                       

739
00:40:23,834 --> 00:40:26,432
Listen, he's adorable,          
but he's bunkin' with you.      

740
00:40:26,501 --> 00:40:28,532
                  It's only till
             my kids are asleep.

741
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:30,298
You gotta be kidding me.        

742
00:40:30,367 --> 00:40:32,399
The two of you                  
are engaged.                    

743
00:40:32,467 --> 00:40:34,399
                 I don't have to
             flaunt it all over,

744
00:40:34,467 --> 00:40:36,332
              Like traipsing off
         with some strange woman

745
00:40:36,401 --> 00:40:38,132
     In the middle of the night.

746
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:39,132
What, with felice?              

747
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,565
You should be so lucky.         

748
00:40:41,634 --> 00:40:44,198
       Heeeey, roomte.          

749
00:40:44,267 --> 00:40:45,598
Hey.                            

750
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:48,865
              Ah.               

751
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:54,965
          ( snoring )           

752
00:40:59,501 --> 00:41:01,132
     ( snoring continues )      

753
00:41:07,834 --> 00:41:09,732
           Russell.             

754
00:41:16,334 --> 00:41:18,499
          Yo, romeo!            

755
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:21,332
              Oh!               

756
00:41:23,867 --> 00:41:25,232
          You're on.            

757
00:41:26,967 --> 00:41:27,865
              Ah.               

758
00:41:28,067 --> 00:41:29,065
             Ssh.               

759
00:41:31,434 --> 00:41:34,465
        Coming, coming.         

760
00:41:39,167 --> 00:41:40,598
                   I missed you.

761
00:41:40,667 --> 00:41:44,899
Oh, no, darling,                
no, I couldn't.                 

762
00:41:44,967 --> 00:41:47,065
I couldn't,                     
no, I--                         

763
00:41:47,134 --> 00:41:48,965
Not with him                    
in the next room,               

764
00:41:49,034 --> 00:41:50,965
I just, I--                     
I can't,                        

765
00:41:51,034 --> 00:41:55,798
Oh, sweetheart, ow!             
Ow! I just can't, I--           

766
00:41:55,867 --> 00:41:58,032
( snores )                      

767
00:42:27,667 --> 00:42:29,332
                    We're going!

768
00:42:29,401 --> 00:42:31,065
             Huh?               

769
00:42:31,134 --> 00:42:33,132
See you later, mom.             

770
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:34,065
            Where--             

771
00:42:34,134 --> 00:42:35,965
     Where are you going?       

772
00:42:36,034 --> 00:42:37,932
            Thomas!             

773
00:42:39,967 --> 00:42:40,999
Dad.                            

774
00:42:41,067 --> 00:42:42,265
                      Hey, daph.

775
00:42:42,334 --> 00:42:44,265
                    What are you
                    up to today?

776
00:42:44,334 --> 00:42:46,565
Um, we were                     
going skating,                  
remember?                       

777
00:42:46,634 --> 00:42:48,399
                       Oh, sure.

778
00:42:48,467 --> 00:42:50,765
                        I, uh...

779
00:42:50,834 --> 00:42:52,198
Forgot.                         

780
00:42:52,267 --> 00:42:53,865
              Well, no, I, um...

781
00:42:53,934 --> 00:42:56,832
            Well, I just thought
         maybe we'd do it later.

782
00:42:56,901 --> 00:43:00,298
Whatever.                       
I'll see you later.             

783
00:43:10,434 --> 00:43:12,432
                     Oh, sorry--
                     I love you.

784
00:43:12,501 --> 00:43:13,632
    What?                       

785
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:17,399
                     Um, europe.
                  I love europe.

786
00:43:17,467 --> 00:43:19,899
Isn't that                      
a foreign country?              

787
00:43:19,967 --> 00:43:21,832
                       Yeah.    

788
00:43:21,901 --> 00:43:23,232
Cool.                           

789
00:43:24,467 --> 00:43:26,265
                   Come on, kel,
                       let's go.

790
00:43:26,334 --> 00:43:27,565
Do you wanna hang?              

791
00:43:27,634 --> 00:43:28,798
                       Hang?    

792
00:43:28,867 --> 00:43:31,298
Yeah. Just chill.               

793
00:43:31,367 --> 00:43:33,132
                   By all means,
           let's hang and chill.

794
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:37,332
She is so bizarre.              

795
00:43:37,401 --> 00:43:39,332
             Yeah.              

796
00:43:39,401 --> 00:43:41,332
Forget that, man,               
I'll teach you.                 

797
00:43:41,401 --> 00:43:44,532
I'm an excellent sailor,        
I've been lots of times.        

798
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:46,032
             Well, I don't know.

799
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:48,965
What do you have to do,         
go ask your mommy first?        

800
00:43:49,034 --> 00:43:50,565
                         No.    

801
00:43:50,634 --> 00:43:52,632
           We don't have a boat.

802
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:54,198
No problem.                     

803
00:44:01,534 --> 00:44:02,598
                  What do we do?

804
00:44:02,667 --> 00:44:04,598
Here, take a live vest.         

805
00:44:04,667 --> 00:44:06,999
             How do I put it on?

806
00:44:07,067 --> 00:44:08,732
    Zip it.                     

807
00:44:17,034 --> 00:44:18,665
Max, just grab the front.       

808
00:44:18,734 --> 00:44:21,665
Turn it around--ready?          

809
00:44:21,734 --> 00:44:24,732
One, two, three!                

810
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:26,598
       ( both grunting )        

811
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:32,598
               All right, now we
               gotta push it in.

812
00:44:32,667 --> 00:44:35,332
Louis, I really dot             
know how to sail.               

813
00:44:35,401 --> 00:44:37,465
           Don't worry about it,
           I'll take care of it.

814
00:44:37,534 --> 00:44:39,065
                       Ungh!    

815
00:44:40,334 --> 00:44:41,598
                    Come on!    

816
00:44:48,767 --> 00:44:50,765
                          Julia:
      He says I smother my kids.

817
00:44:50,834 --> 00:44:52,899
     I don't smother them, do I?

818
00:44:52,967 --> 00:44:54,632
No, not at all.                 
Look at this one!               

819
00:44:54,700 --> 00:44:57,198
                       Oh...    

820
00:44:57,234 --> 00:44:59,632
                       Ha ha ha!

821
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:02,798
                     Oh, this is
             the life, isn't it?

822
00:45:02,867 --> 00:45:05,798
                 Just you and me
     and all these wild berries.

823
00:45:05,867 --> 00:45:10,132
How wild do you                 
want to get?                    

824
00:45:13,667 --> 00:45:15,665
            You mean right here?

825
00:45:15,734 --> 00:45:17,732
     Oh, julia, I would love to,

826
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:20,032
              But all these poor
        little berries, I mean--

827
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:22,298
                 And think about
            the stains involved.

828
00:45:22,367 --> 00:45:25,265
Well, the house--               
it's empty.                     

829
00:45:25,334 --> 00:45:26,265
                           Yeah.

830
00:45:42,567 --> 00:45:44,198
           Max, grab the rudder.

831
00:45:44,267 --> 00:45:46,198
I-I'm not ready yet.            

832
00:45:46,267 --> 00:45:48,698
                   Come on, man,
                     just do it.

833
00:45:48,767 --> 00:45:49,765
Okay.                           

834
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:52,399
                       Watch it.

835
00:45:53,334 --> 00:45:55,332
               Grab the serer.  

836
00:45:55,401 --> 00:45:56,765
                         Got it?
Yeah.                           

837
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:07,499
             Max:               
         Hey! Thomas!           

838
00:46:07,567 --> 00:46:09,332
         Hey! Thomas!           

839
00:46:09,401 --> 00:46:13,865
Hey, thomas, look,              
I'm sailing!                    

840
00:46:13,934 --> 00:46:15,732
                     Oh, my god.

841
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:17,232
                    Is that max?

842
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:19,899
Look, I'm sailing!              

843
00:46:19,967 --> 00:46:21,632
Thomas, look!

845
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:54,598
            Oh, my god, the dog.

846
00:46:54,667 --> 00:46:56,232
      Oh, leave the dog.        

847
00:46:56,300 --> 00:46:57,965
          Merv! Merv!           

848
00:47:04,001 --> 00:47:06,332
          ( humming )           

849
00:47:27,634 --> 00:47:30,432
       Ow! My feet hurt!        

850
00:47:37,634 --> 00:47:39,598
                 Oh, you rascal.

851
00:47:39,667 --> 00:47:42,665
             Sit. Sit. Sit. Sit.

00:48:07,501 --> 00:48:09,565
                   Oh! Russell?!

853
00:48:09,634 --> 00:48:11,965
Don't stop now.                 

854
00:48:12,034 --> 00:48:13,632
                       Aahh!

856
00:48:18,901 --> 00:48:22,399
Julia! Where you going?         

857
00:48:22,467 --> 00:48:25,165
Come on, julia,                 
don't stop now...               

858
00:48:25,234 --> 00:48:28,098
We'd just gotten started!       

859
00:48:28,167 --> 00:48:29,165
Julia!                          

860
00:48:30,867 --> 00:48:31,965
Where is she?                   

861
00:48:32,034 --> 00:48:33,632
             Um...              

862
00:48:33,700 --> 00:48:35,465
Julia.                          

863
00:48:35,534 --> 00:48:38,965
It was karl binder              
from the symposium.             

864
00:48:39,034 --> 00:48:41,165
They want us up                 
in san francisco                

865
00:48:41,234 --> 00:48:43,698
                        They do?

866
00:48:43,767 --> 00:48:47,265
We are going to                 
fill in on a panel!             

867
00:48:47,334 --> 00:48:49,499
                          Ha ha!

868
00:48:49,567 --> 00:48:52,399
It's such an honor!             

869
00:48:52,467 --> 00:48:55,265
Unh...Unh...                    

870
00:48:55,934 --> 00:48:57,365
Aah!                            

871
00:48:57,434 --> 00:49:00,365
You should get dressed.         

872
00:49:13,767 --> 00:49:15,632
What did he do now?             

873
00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:16,965
                        He left.

874
00:49:17,034 --> 00:49:19,198
Figures. Where to?              

875
00:49:19,267 --> 00:49:22,132
                To guest lecture
               at the symposium.

876
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:24,032
My father?                      

877
00:49:24,100 --> 00:49:26,132
             No, I mean russell.

878
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:28,232
Men suck.                       

879
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:30,798
                 Don't say that,
                        not yet.

880
00:49:30,867 --> 00:49:32,865
         Hey, daphne,           
        there you are,          

881
00:49:32,934 --> 00:49:34,932
       I've been looking        
       for you all day.         

882
00:49:36,634 --> 00:49:38,932
                     Wuzz?      

883
00:49:39,001 --> 00:49:40,465
       Hey, I know you,         

884
00:49:40,534 --> 00:49:42,232
       Don't tell me...         
        You're my son.          

885
00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:43,965
                      Ha. Funny.

886
00:49:44,034 --> 00:49:45,399
Where's your brother?           

887
00:49:45,467 --> 00:49:46,798
                He's out sailing
                     with louis.

888
00:49:46,867 --> 00:49:47,798
          He's what?!           

889
00:49:47,867 --> 00:49:49,265
            Sailing, with louis.

890
00:49:51,100 --> 00:49:52,265
                    Don't worry!

891
00:49:52,334 --> 00:49:54,732
         Louis is a good sailor,
                they'll be fine.

892
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:56,798
            Well--              

893
00:49:56,867 --> 00:49:58,865
     ( thunder crackles )       

894
00:50:25,567 --> 00:50:26,565
       ( louis screams )        

895
00:50:26,634 --> 00:50:27,665
Louis!                          

896
00:50:27,734 --> 00:50:29,298
    No!                         

897
00:50:31,634 --> 00:50:32,999
Louis!!!                        

898
00:50:33,067 --> 00:50:34,865
Here, grab on!                  

899
00:50:39,867 --> 00:50:41,298
          We're doing           
     everything possible.       

900
00:50:41,367 --> 00:50:44,665
       You can't tell us to just
            stand here and wait.

901
00:50:44,734 --> 00:50:45,965
         Our ds are out there!  

902
00:50:46,034 --> 00:50:47,865
       Sir, if you care         
        about the kids,         

903
00:50:47,934 --> 00:50:50,499
      You will calm down        
    and let us do our job.      

904
00:50:51,967 --> 00:50:55,065
Come on! Grab on!               

905
00:50:57,567 --> 00:50:59,132
Hold onto my hand!              

906
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:00,732
You listen to me--              

907
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:03,198
You're gonna get on that horn   
and get out the whole fleet     

908
00:51:03,267 --> 00:51:05,032
If you have to                  
to find our kids!               

909
00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:08,032
Now! You understand? Now!       

910
00:51:08,100 --> 00:51:09,965
          Yes, ma'am.           

911
00:51:11,267 --> 00:51:12,798
    Come on!                    

912
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:22,965
                    ( coughing )

913
00:51:24,334 --> 00:51:28,332
            Radio:              
      Things are getting        
    pretty rough out here.      

914
00:51:28,401 --> 00:51:30,865
    This is the coasguard       
  reporting offshore swells,    

915
00:51:30,934 --> 00:51:32,965
        Wind northwest,         
         50-75 knots.           

916
00:51:38,634 --> 00:51:40,632
    Vessel is described as      
       a small sailboat         

917
00:51:40,700 --> 00:51:42,932
    With two male juveniles     
           on board.            

918
00:51:43,001 --> 00:51:44,765
          Helicopter:           
          Roger that.           

919
00:51:44,834 --> 00:51:46,632
   Reporting clearing skies.    

920
00:51:51,134 --> 00:51:53,132
    We have them in sight.      

921
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:54,432
       What's your eta?         

922
00:51:54,501 --> 00:51:56,698
     Eta 20 to 30 minutes.      

923
00:51:56,767 --> 00:51:58,999
          Help! Help!           

924
00:51:59,067 --> 00:52:02,132
       Hello! Over here!        

925
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:05,098
       Over here! Help!!        

926
00:52:07,567 --> 00:52:09,499
The waves were like             
200 feet high,                  

927
00:52:09,567 --> 00:52:12,198
I thought for sure              
we were shark bait.             

928
00:52:12,267 --> 00:52:13,965
    You must have freaked.      

929
00:52:14,034 --> 00:52:15,532
No, I was cool.                 

930
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:18,432
        The point is, your safe,
           you had an aenture.  

931
00:52:18,501 --> 00:52:20,598
An adventure,                   
is that what this is?           

932
00:52:20,667 --> 00:52:22,932
            Well, it's something
                they'll remember

933
00:52:23,001 --> 00:52:24,298
        The rest of their lives.

934
00:52:24,367 --> 00:52:26,332
They're lucky they have         
the rest of their lives.        

935
00:52:26,401 --> 00:52:28,465
            Julia, take it easy,
                   they're fine.

936
00:52:28,534 --> 00:52:32,265
Yeah, an hour ago               
you were a bowl full of jello.  

937
00:52:32,334 --> 00:52:33,665
                          Jello?

938
00:52:33,734 --> 00:52:36,032
   I would never, ever be jello.

939
00:52:36,100 --> 00:52:39,098
              Chocolate pudding,
             maybe, never jello.

940
00:52:39,167 --> 00:52:40,365
That's it.                      
                           What?

941
00:52:40,434 --> 00:52:42,798
Out of the house,               
I want you guys                 
out of the house!               

942
00:52:42,867 --> 00:52:45,132
        Mom, it's not his fault,
       okay? It's not his fault.

943
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:47,399
Thomas, they're dangerous,      
don't you see?                  

944
00:52:47,467 --> 00:52:52,665
     But it's not louis's fault,
     he's a good sailor, really.

945
00:52:52,734 --> 00:52:54,032
           I made him do it.    

946
00:52:54,100 --> 00:52:56,765
Why would you                   
do such a thing?                

947
00:52:59,134 --> 00:53:02,032
           To learn how to sail.

948
00:53:02,100 --> 00:53:06,298
  I thought maybe if I knew now,
    dad might take me next time.

949
00:53:12,834 --> 00:53:14,732
I'm sorry, louis.               

950
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:16,798
I'm sorry,                      
I thought it was you.           

951
00:53:16,867 --> 00:53:18,598
    Usually is.                 

952
00:53:18,667 --> 00:53:20,598
                Don't get cute--
       the repairs for that boat

953
00:53:20,667 --> 00:53:22,465
                  Are coming out
              of your allowance.

954
00:53:22,534 --> 00:53:24,265
I don't have an allowance.      

955
00:53:24,334 --> 00:53:25,499
                        Details.

956
00:53:27,567 --> 00:53:29,132
    Thanks.                     

957
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:31,532
                  Just don't say
             you weren't scared.

958
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:46,598
         ( knocking )           

959
00:53:52,167 --> 00:53:54,298
No lights.                      

960
00:53:54,367 --> 00:53:56,298
            I know.             

961
00:53:56,367 --> 00:53:58,832
You, uh, gonna be all right?    

962
00:53:58,901 --> 00:54:01,332
          Yes, I'm fine, thanks.

963
00:54:02,934 --> 00:54:05,698
C-c-c-can I sleep with you?     

964
00:54:05,767 --> 00:54:07,598
                      What?!    

965
00:54:07,667 --> 00:54:08,965
Just sleep with you.            

966
00:54:09,034 --> 00:54:10,132
                     I told you,

967
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:12,098
        I thought it was russell
                  in the shower.

968
00:54:12,167 --> 00:54:14,432
You know, in the corner,        
or on the floor.                

969
00:54:14,501 --> 00:54:16,865
I could cram in                 
behind the chair over there.    

970
00:54:19,734 --> 00:54:21,399
                  You're afrai  

971
00:54:21,467 --> 00:54:24,098
No, I'm not afraid,             
I just feel a little...         

972
00:54:24,167 --> 00:54:28,032
 Exposed, sleeping out there    
 in the living room.            

973
00:54:28,100 --> 00:54:33,165
   You know, thunder is just air
 suddenly heating and expanding.

974
00:54:33,234 --> 00:54:35,432
Can I sleep here, or not?       

975
00:54:35,501 --> 00:54:38,565
                   Not! Go sleep
                  with the kids.

976
00:54:38,634 --> 00:54:41,832
I don't want them to know.      

977
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:51,165
        it's amazing          

978
00:54:51,234 --> 00:54:54,732
          how you can          
   speak right to my heart     

979
00:54:59,401 --> 00:55:02,565
    without sayin' a word     

980
00:55:02,634 --> 00:55:07,265
  you can light up the dark   

981
00:55:10,334 --> 00:55:12,532
       you say it best        

982
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:17,665
 when you say nothing at all  

983
00:55:21,867 --> 00:55:24,332
           ( sis )              

984
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:34,198
            Ha ha!              

985
00:55:34,267 --> 00:55:36,565
       Okay, watch this.        

986
00:55:38,501 --> 00:55:40,598
Put it on!                      
              Ssh!              

987
00:55:40,667 --> 00:55:43,832
                 Is it true that
         all good chefs are men?

988
00:55:43,867 --> 00:55:47,065
          No, there's           
      women masters, too.       

989
00:55:47,134 --> 00:55:48,765
                         Daphne:
                          Dad...

990
00:55:50,901 --> 00:55:52,465
        Let me tell you         
       something, guys.         

991
00:55:52,534 --> 00:55:54,065
       Every man should         
      learn how to cook.        

992
00:55:54,134 --> 00:55:55,965
How did you do that?            

993
00:55:56,034 --> 00:55:57,798
      I'm glad you asked.       

994
00:55:57,867 --> 00:56:01,165
   It shows inquisitiveness     
    and a scientific mind.      

995
00:56:01,234 --> 00:56:03,032
       It's practical--         

996
00:56:03,067 --> 00:56:05,832
      In a world of love,       
 it's a very persuasive skill.  

997
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:08,999
               What do you mean?

998
00:56:09,067 --> 00:56:11,698
        If you cook for         
      a woman you adore,        

999
00:56:11,767 --> 00:56:15,198
    Prepare it and serve it     
     with your own hands,       

1000
00:56:15,267 --> 00:56:18,465
    That woman, my friend,      
        will be yours.          

1001
00:56:18,534 --> 00:56:20,332
                  Mine for what?

1002
00:56:20,401 --> 00:56:21,932
Thomas:                         
Matt, you're a professional--   

1003
00:56:22,001 --> 00:56:24,532
What are we supposed to         
cook for girls--grilled cheese? 

1004
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:27,565
         Why not? Cook anything,
  as long as you do it together.

1005
00:56:27,634 --> 00:56:30,065
          There's only one thing
                  more seductive

1006
00:56:30,134 --> 00:56:32,698
                Than cooking for
            a beautil woman...  

1007
00:56:34,401 --> 00:56:36,965
 And that's cooking with her.   

1008
00:56:39,100 --> 00:56:40,399
Hey, uh, max,                   

1009
00:56:40,467 --> 00:56:42,332
Maybe we suld go                
check on the shrimp.            

1010
00:56:42,401 --> 00:56:44,698
                  We're gonna go
            check on the shrimp.

1011
00:56:44,767 --> 00:56:46,565
      I'll be right back.       

1012
00:56:48,901 --> 00:56:52,198
     We've improvised just about
 every home experiment there is.

1013
00:56:52,267 --> 00:56:54,798
And I've cooked                 
just about                      

1014
00:56:54,867 --> 00:56:56,365
Everything perishable           
in the entire house.            

1015
00:56:56,434 --> 00:56:59,465
Except your vegetables,         

1016
00:56:59,534 --> 00:57:02,065
And I wouldn't dare             
touch your vegetables.          

1017
00:57:02,134 --> 00:57:05,598
                   You can touch
                  my vegetables.

1018
00:57:05,667 --> 00:57:07,932
                         Really?

1019
00:57:08,001 --> 00:57:10,732
Um-hmm.                         

1020
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:15,232
                          Julia:
                  Where are they
                      all going?

1021
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:16,465
I don't know,                   

1022
00:57:16,534 --> 00:57:19,832
Maybe the clubhouse             
has some power--wanna go?       

1023
00:57:23,767 --> 00:57:25,798
Man:                            
Wendell, you survived!          

1024
00:57:25,867 --> 00:57:28,332
There's bottle water            
in the back.                    

1025
00:57:28,401 --> 00:57:31,399
Clubhouse is for                
owners only--                   
I'm so sorry.                   

1026
00:57:31,467 --> 00:57:33,565
        Oh, gee, that's too bad,

1027
00:57:33,634 --> 00:57:35,265
              I guess that means
    we're just gonna have to eat

1028
00:57:35,334 --> 00:57:37,332
               All these skewers
                of spicy shrimp,

1029
00:57:37,401 --> 00:57:40,165
              Stuffed mushrooms,
                   eese puffs,  

1030
00:57:40,234 --> 00:57:43,765
      Canapes and chocolate cake
               all by ourselves.

1031
00:57:43,834 --> 00:57:47,065
Hey, everybody,                 
they brought food!              

1032
00:57:52,967 --> 00:57:55,032
Feed her.                       

1033
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:00,932
                         Hi.    

1034
00:58:01,001 --> 00:58:02,298
    Hi.                         

1035
00:58:02,367 --> 00:58:06,265
                    I actually--
                   I made these.

1036
00:58:06,334 --> 00:58:09,165
Hey, guys,                      
this europe guy can co.         

1037
00:58:11,167 --> 00:58:14,765
               Thomas, actually.
              My name is thomas.

1038
00:58:21,734 --> 00:58:23,298
          one, two            

1039
00:58:23,367 --> 00:58:25,899
       three, four, five       
     erybody in the car        

1040
00:58:25,967 --> 00:58:27,465
     so come on and ride      

1041
00:58:27,534 --> 00:58:29,332
      to the liquor store      
      around the corner        

1042
00:58:29,401 --> 00:58:31,265
    the boys say they want     
      some ginny juice         

1043
00:58:31,334 --> 00:58:32,632
  but I don't really wanna    

1044
00:58:32,700 --> 00:58:35,065
    be a bust like the high    
          last week            

1045
00:58:35,134 --> 00:58:37,798
       I must stay deep        
    'cause talk is cheap       

1046
00:58:37,867 --> 00:58:40,732
    I like angela, pamela,     
       sandra and rita         

1047
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:41,899
      and as I continue       

1048
00:58:41,967 --> 00:58:43,598
  you know it gets sweeter    

1049
00:58:43,667 --> 00:58:46,032
       so where can I do       
    a really bad humanoid      

1050
00:58:46,100 --> 00:58:49,098
        to me, flirtin'        
    is just like a sport       

1051
00:58:49,167 --> 00:58:50,932
   anything, it's all good    

1052
00:58:51,001 --> 00:58:52,732
       let me jump in         

1053
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:55,932
    a little bit of monica     
          in my life           

1054
00:58:56,001 --> 00:58:58,265
    a little bit of erica      
          by my side           

1055
00:58:58,334 --> 00:59:00,865
     a little bit of rita      
          all I need           

1056
00:59:00,934 --> 00:59:03,399
    a little bit of tina's     
          what I see           

1057
00:59:03,467 --> 00:59:07,665
    little bit of sandra       
          in the sun           

1058
00:59:07,734 --> 00:59:09,399
     a little bit of mary      
        all night long         

1059
00:59:09,467 --> 00:59:13,132
   a little bit of jessica     
           here I am           

1060
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:15,532
     a little bit of ruby      
       makes me your man       

1061
00:59:17,167 --> 00:59:20,565
 ( instrumental interlude )   

1062
00:59:31,334 --> 00:59:33,399
    my toes are on fire!      

1063
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:38,598
      jump up and down        

1064
00:59:38,667 --> 00:59:39,932
   and move it all around     

1065
00:59:40,001 --> 00:59:42,332
       shake your hands        
        to the sounds          

1066
00:59:42,401 --> 00:59:44,999
   You've cut in line again.    

1067
00:59:51,734 --> 00:59:55,499
        Sometimes you have to be
    to get where you want to be.

1068
00:59:55,567 --> 00:59:58,465
    a little bit of erica      
          by my side           

1069
00:59:58,534 --> 01:00:01,432
     a little bit of rita      
          all I need           

1070
01:00:01,501 --> 01:00:04,132
    a little bit of tina's     
          what I see           

1071
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:06,865
    a little bit of sandra     
          in the sun           

1072
01:00:06,934 --> 01:00:09,032
    a little bit of mary      
        all night long         

1073
01:00:09,100 --> 01:00:12,399
   a little bit of jessica     
           here I am           

1074
01:00:12,467 --> 01:00:14,432
     a little bit of ruby      
       makes me your man       

1075
01:00:14,501 --> 01:00:17,365
    a little bit of monica     
          in my life           

1076
01:00:17,434 --> 01:00:20,532
     a little bit of erica     
          by my side           

1077
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:23,065
    a little bit of rita      
          all I need           

1078
01:00:23,134 --> 01:00:25,532
    a little bit of tina's     
          what I see           

1079
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:27,798
    a little bit of sandra     
          in the sun           

1080
01:00:27,867 --> 01:00:30,465
     a little bit of mary      
        all night long         

1081
01:00:30,534 --> 01:00:33,632
    a little bit of jessica    
           here I am           

1082
01:00:33,700 --> 01:00:36,865
     a little bit of ruby      
      makes me your man        

1083
01:00:36,934 --> 01:00:39,798
        I do want to          

1084
01:00:39,867 --> 01:00:42,598
         fall in love          
    with a girl like you       

1085
01:00:42,667 --> 01:00:44,899
        you can't run,         
       you can't hide          

1086
01:00:44,967 --> 01:00:48,665
          you and me           
    gonna touch the sky 떰      

1087
01:00:59,767 --> 01:01:00,899
             Boo!               

1088
01:01:00,967 --> 01:01:03,132
            Ha ha!              

1089
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:05,732
                 Boy, do we have
         some good news for you.

1090
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:08,165
We found several vacancies.     

1091
01:01:08,234 --> 01:01:09,432
Several vacancies?              

1092
01:01:09,501 --> 01:01:11,232
  Yes, isn't that wonderful?    

1093
01:01:11,300 --> 01:01:14,165
The storm must have             
washed some folks away.         

1094
01:01:14,234 --> 01:01:16,132
                     Out to sea.
                       Ha ha ha!

1095
01:01:17,501 --> 01:01:19,298
         There is still, though,

1096
01:01:19,367 --> 01:01:22,798
    The question of which family
         is gonna have to leave.

1097
01:01:24,867 --> 01:01:25,999
Well...                         

1098
01:01:26,067 --> 01:01:28,432
That is what you want,          
isn't it?                       

1099
01:01:28,501 --> 01:01:30,165
                     Absolutely!
Of course!                      

1100
01:01:33,100 --> 01:01:35,565
Well, the trip's                
most over, right,               

1101
01:01:35,634 --> 01:01:38,298
So I think moving               
would be such a disruption.     

1102
01:01:38,367 --> 01:01:40,165
                   And the kids.

1103
01:01:40,234 --> 01:01:43,432
             The kids are really
              getting along now.

1104
01:01:43,501 --> 01:01:45,899
It would be a shame             
to split them up.               

1105
01:01:45,967 --> 01:01:47,565
       So I think I'm just gonna

1106
01:01:47,634 --> 01:01:50,365
         Have to bite the bullet
              on this one and...

1107
01:01:50,434 --> 01:01:51,765
                       Stay put.

1108
01:01:51,834 --> 01:01:53,632
                 Okay.          

1109
01:01:53,700 --> 01:01:55,032
             For the kids' sake.

1110
01:01:56,234 --> 01:01:58,665
          For the kids' sake.   

1111
01:01:58,734 --> 01:02:01,765
           All right, okay,     
            we got to run.      

1112
01:02:01,834 --> 01:02:03,499
What do they mean               
"for the kid's sake?"           

1113
01:02:12,967 --> 01:02:16,265
            To our first time...

1114
01:02:16,334 --> 01:02:18,032
               Cooking together.

1115
01:02:19,234 --> 01:02:20,232
    Yes.                        

1116
01:02:26,600 --> 01:02:30,165
  Today we're going to be making
      a lot of different dishes.

1117
01:02:30,234 --> 01:02:33,465
             've got all these  
    fabulous fresh ingredients--

1118
01:02:33,534 --> 01:02:37,232
             Vegetables, spices,
                   herbs, and...

1119
01:02:37,300 --> 01:02:39,832
        Julia, you don't have to
                     take notes,

1120
01:02:39,901 --> 01:02:41,899
     It's n a chemiry class.    

1121
01:02:41,967 --> 01:02:45,065
               Cooking is a very
            sensuous experience,

1122
01:02:45,134 --> 01:02:48,665
            It's all about taste
             and smell and mouth

1123
01:02:48,734 --> 01:02:53,032
      And color and touch and...

1124
01:02:53,100 --> 01:02:55,198
Okay.                           

1125
01:02:55,267 --> 01:02:57,065
                  It's hands on.

1126
01:02:57,134 --> 01:02:58,332
                    Take it off.

1127
01:02:58,401 --> 01:02:59,798
What?                           

1128
01:02:59,867 --> 01:03:02,132
                      The watch.

1129
01:03:02,200 --> 01:03:05,565
       You have to take it off--
                let me help you.

1130
01:03:05,634 --> 01:03:07,565
Well...                         

1131
01:03:07,634 --> 01:03:09,532
                           Oops.

1132
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:11,632
                   There we are.

1133
01:03:15,300 --> 01:03:16,565
                    Um...Salmon.

1134
01:03:19,100 --> 01:03:21,765
          Look at that marvelous
                     piece of...

1135
01:03:21,834 --> 01:03:24,632
          Fresatlantic salmon.  

1136
01:03:24,700 --> 01:03:27,465
                    ( sniffing )
    mmm, I thought we'd poach it

1137
01:03:27,534 --> 01:03:29,999
               And serve it with
         a tomato buerre blanc--

1138
01:03:30,067 --> 01:03:31,332
              What do you think?

1139
01:03:31,401 --> 01:03:34,632
Can we use my tomatoes?         

1140
01:03:36,734 --> 01:03:37,865
I got them from the market.     

1141
01:03:37,934 --> 01:03:40,298
                    The market--
               the organic ones.

1142
01:03:40,367 --> 01:03:45,565
       I think we'd love to cook
             with your tomatoes.

1143
01:03:53,467 --> 01:03:55,165
                         Daphne:
                So when are they
                getting married?

1144
01:03:55,234 --> 01:03:57,999
Thomas:                         
Mom said after                  
the potato crop comes in,       

1145
01:03:58,067 --> 01:03:59,965
And then we've got to           
move to america                 

1146
01:04:00,034 --> 01:04:01,598
So she caninish                 
her exchange program.           

1147
01:04:01,667 --> 01:04:02,832
     So you guys are going      
        to be a family,         

1148
01:04:02,901 --> 01:04:05,632
      Like all together?        
         Not like us.           

1149
01:04:05,700 --> 01:04:08,098
Dad said I'm moving in          
with him this summer.           

1150
01:04:08,167 --> 01:04:09,632
      Get it in writing.        

1151
01:04:09,700 --> 01:04:11,065
Come on.                        

1152
01:04:11,134 --> 01:04:14,499
 I'd much rather have your dad  
not around than russell around. 

1153
01:04:24,700 --> 01:04:27,832
Unh-uhn, just...                

1154
01:04:27,901 --> 01:04:29,565
                But threcipe--  

1155
01:04:29,634 --> 01:04:32,098
Good chefs always               
cook by feel,                   

1156
01:04:32,167 --> 01:04:34,698
Now come on,                    
put your hand in.               

1157
01:04:42,067 --> 01:04:44,532
Yes...                          

1158
01:04:48,100 --> 01:04:50,165
             Now for some oil...

1159
01:04:55,567 --> 01:04:59,499
   sometimes I feel myself    

1160
01:04:59,567 --> 01:05:01,698
      losing control...       

1161
01:05:12,834 --> 01:05:14,798
                    What's next?

1162
01:05:14,867 --> 01:05:18,432
We let it rise.                 

1163
01:05:31,467 --> 01:05:33,598
                      Feel good?

1164
01:05:42,001 --> 01:05:43,432
( panting )                     

1165
01:06:13,967 --> 01:06:16,565
               You're dad's fun.
         He makes you feel good.

1166
01:06:16,634 --> 01:06:18,932
Well, your mom's                
smart and interesting,          

1167
01:06:19,001 --> 01:06:20,132
And really cool.                

1168
01:06:20,200 --> 01:06:22,032
       She's interested,        

1169
01:06:22,100 --> 01:06:24,665
      I mean, she listens       
    and she's really cool.      

1170
01:06:24,734 --> 01:06:28,098
What if they...                 
Got together?                   

1171
01:06:28,167 --> 01:06:29,532
                No way!         

1172
01:06:29,600 --> 01:06:31,765
    You saw them danceogether,  
    I mean, I'm just saying.    

1173
01:06:31,834 --> 01:06:34,632
Yeah, I could see that          
totally happening.              

1174
01:06:34,700 --> 01:06:37,832
            Dancing's one thing,
 but a couple? I don't think so.

1175
01:06:40,401 --> 01:06:42,399
He's a lot different            
than russell.                   

1176
01:06:45,300 --> 01:06:48,232
All righmerv, come on.          

1177
01:06:48,300 --> 01:06:50,632
              Why don't you just
            leave the dog alone?

1178
01:07:01,034 --> 01:07:03,232
Felice asked me to              
drop this tuxedo off.           

1179
01:07:03,300 --> 01:07:05,132
Here's matt's invitation,       

1180
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:07,132
She said she'll                 
see him at the party.           

1181
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:08,565
            Thanks.             

1182
01:07:17,001 --> 01:07:19,399
Looks like they've              
been cooking.                   

1183
01:07:19,467 --> 01:07:22,232
       Smells more like         
 they were burning something.   

1184
01:07:22,300 --> 01:07:25,565
      Hey, dad, I got this stuff
            for you from felice.

1185
01:07:25,634 --> 01:07:27,999
For her father's                
birthday party.                 

1186
01:07:28,067 --> 01:07:29,965
              Tonight? I forgot.
                         Thanks.

1187
01:07:30,034 --> 01:07:31,965
You're going, right?            

1188
01:07:32,034 --> 01:07:33,865
           Oh, I got a lot of...

1189
01:07:33,934 --> 01:07:35,798
                Straightening up
                     to do here.

1190
01:07:35,867 --> 01:07:37,965
No, no, it's my mess.           
I'll do it.                     

1191
01:07:40,167 --> 01:07:41,798
I'll do it!                     

1192
01:07:46,134 --> 01:07:49,132
( irritated: )                  
go on, I'll clean up.           

1193
01:08:09,734 --> 01:08:12,365
                      Wake up...

1194
01:08:12,434 --> 01:08:15,032
        What's with you tonight?

1195
01:08:16,867 --> 01:08:18,598
I'm sorry.                      

1196
01:08:18,667 --> 01:08:21,399
Must be too much sun.           

1197
01:08:21,467 --> 01:08:22,965
Come on.                        

1198
01:08:25,367 --> 01:08:27,532
         Who's hungry?          

1199
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:28,798
 You're                         
 gonnaook?                      

1200
01:08:28,834 --> 01:08:31,098
             Um, no, your father
              left a few things,

1201
01:08:31,167 --> 01:08:32,332
            So I'll reheat them.

1202
01:08:32,401 --> 01:08:33,732
    Good.                       

1203
01:08:40,234 --> 01:08:42,565
              Felice's last name
                   is templeton?

1204
01:08:42,634 --> 01:08:44,065
Um-hmm.                         

1205
01:08:44,134 --> 01:08:45,765

               cedric templeton?

1206
01:08:45,834 --> 01:08:46,765
Um-hmm.                         

1207
01:08:46,834 --> 01:08:48,865
 As in the templeton fountion?  

1208
01:08:48,934 --> 01:08:50,265
Um-hmm.                         

1209
01:08:50,334 --> 01:08:53,098
      My god, it's in the grant.

1210
01:08:53,167 --> 01:08:54,832
        This is great!          

1211
01:08:54,901 --> 01:08:56,565
    Okay.                       

1212
01:09:03,834 --> 01:09:07,032
          Oh....Oh...           

1213
01:09:07,100 --> 01:09:08,365
Happy birthday.                 

1214
01:09:08,434 --> 01:09:11,865
      My gracious alive,        
       it is beautiful!         

1215
01:09:11,934 --> 01:09:12,865
Like it?                        

1216
01:09:12,934 --> 01:09:14,565
        Oh, thank you!          

1217
01:09:20,567 --> 01:09:22,865
         Good evening,          
         how are you?           

1218
01:09:22,934 --> 01:09:24,298
                  Oh, thank you.

1219
01:09:24,367 --> 01:09:25,632
              Oh!               

1220
01:09:25,700 --> 01:09:28,432
            Cedric:             
         Well, well...          

1221
01:09:29,267 --> 01:09:31,465
    Julia.                      

1222
01:09:40,434 --> 01:09:42,698
 Is this my birthday present?   

1223
01:09:42,767 --> 01:09:44,765
    ( all laugh politely )      

1224
01:09:48,134 --> 01:09:51,032
          I'm dr. Julia weeland,
          sir, nice to meet you.

1225
01:09:51,100 --> 01:09:54,465
Well, it's nice                 
to meet you.                    

1226
01:09:56,534 --> 01:09:58,065
Is that for me?                 

1227
01:09:58,134 --> 01:09:59,665
                     Yes, it is.

1228
01:09:59,734 --> 01:10:04,065
   And it's my honor to wish you
          a very happy birthday.

1229
01:10:04,134 --> 01:10:05,932
Vegetables.                     

1230
01:10:06,001 --> 01:10:07,698
         ( all laugh )          

1231
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:11,065
    Ah...                       

1232
01:10:11,134 --> 01:10:12,598
           Genetically improved.

1233
01:10:12,667 --> 01:10:15,098
                They're bursting
                     with flavor

1234
01:10:15,167 --> 01:10:17,632
              And saturated with
        every essential vitamin.

1235
01:10:17,700 --> 01:10:20,232
Well, they are colorful.        

1236
01:10:20,300 --> 01:10:22,098
She blocked an enzyme.          

1237
01:10:22,167 --> 01:10:23,132
      I beg your pardon?        

1238
01:10:23,200 --> 01:10:26,332
She blocked an enzyme.          
Sir.                            

1239
01:10:26,401 --> 01:10:28,065
              Oh.               

1240
01:10:30,300 --> 01:10:32,365
Hold on. Dr. Weeland?           

1241
01:10:33,634 --> 01:10:36,665
You're one of                   
the grant finalists.            

1242
01:10:36,734 --> 01:10:38,298
                   Yes, sir.    

1243
01:10:38,367 --> 01:10:39,899
              And mr. Templeton,

1244
01:10:39,967 --> 01:10:41,698
              If you'll just try
           one of my vegetables.

1245
01:10:41,767 --> 01:10:43,698
             Aide:              
         No, no, no...          

1246
01:10:43,767 --> 01:10:46,032
                   I'm afraid he
                  can't do that.

1247
01:10:46,100 --> 01:10:47,232
                    Now, just...

1248
01:10:47,300 --> 01:10:50,265
Julia, julia.                   

1249
01:10:50,334 --> 01:10:51,265
Julia.                          

1250
01:10:51,334 --> 01:10:52,665
                      I'm sorry.

1251
01:10:54,401 --> 01:10:57,365
                  I'll take care
                   of this, sir.

1252
01:10:57,434 --> 01:11:00,432
Well, ahem,                     
what's next?                    

1253
01:11:02,600 --> 01:11:04,532
          What am I going to do?

1254
01:11:04,600 --> 01:11:06,832
                  Three years of
            scientific research,

1255
01:11:06,901 --> 01:11:08,198
            What was I thinking?

1256
01:11:08,267 --> 01:11:10,598
It's gonna be all right.        
Come on.                        

1257
01:11:11,700 --> 01:11:14,632
        Oh, thank you!          
        Oh, thk you!            

1258
01:11:15,800 --> 01:11:18,665
    ( swing music playing )     

1259
01:11:21,867 --> 01:11:24,665
     Ladies and gentlemen,      
       enjoy the buffet.        

1260
01:11:24,734 --> 01:11:28,632
                         Cedric:
                Yes, let us eat.

1261
01:11:29,834 --> 01:11:31,865
Come, come, come.               

1262
01:11:33,300 --> 01:11:34,565
            Cedric!             

1263
01:11:34,634 --> 01:11:35,798
             Yes?               

1264
01:11:35,867 --> 01:11:37,932
In honor of your birthday,      

1265
01:11:38,001 --> 01:11:43,632
I have created something        
really special.                 

1266
01:11:45,234 --> 01:11:47,065
My gift to you.                 

1267
01:11:47,134 --> 01:11:49,532
                     That's, uh,
          too rich for you, sir.

1268
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:51,765
Nonsense.                       

1269
01:11:51,834 --> 01:11:53,865
       Sir, remember your ulcer.

1270
01:11:53,934 --> 01:11:55,432
    Fork!                       

1271
01:12:10,700 --> 01:12:12,265
    Genius.                     

1272
01:12:12,367 --> 01:12:14,565
                    Pure genius.

1273
01:12:14,634 --> 01:12:16,165
Thank you, sir,                 

1274
01:12:16,234 --> 01:12:18,432
T I'm only as good              
as my ingredients.              

1275
01:12:18,501 --> 01:12:23,132
The real genius here            
is dr. Julia weeland.           

1276
01:12:27,567 --> 01:12:30,065
  These are your vegetables?    

1277
01:12:30,134 --> 01:12:32,065
Yes, they are.                  

1278
01:12:36,334 --> 01:12:38,865
    Oh, they are exquisite.     

1279
01:12:38,934 --> 01:12:41,532
      Smythe, write her a check.

1280
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:43,065
              I beg your pardon?

1281
01:12:43,134 --> 01:12:45,999
You heard me--                  
the grant money.                

1282
01:12:47,734 --> 01:12:50,132
                 Sir, what about
            the other finalists?

1283
01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:51,899
                  The committee?

1284
01:12:51,967 --> 01:12:53,932
I am the committee.             

1285
01:12:54,001 --> 01:12:55,765
                       Sir, sir.

1286
01:12:55,834 --> 01:12:57,399
Do it!                          

1287
01:12:57,467 --> 01:13:01,399
Oh, mr. Templeton,              
thank you so much.              

1288
01:13:01,467 --> 01:13:05,198
You don't know                  
what this means to me.          

1289
01:13:05,267 --> 01:13:06,965
            Ha ha!              

1290
01:13:07,034 --> 01:13:09,265
                      Julia.    

1291
01:13:15,401 --> 01:13:16,932
     Why did you do this for me?

1292
01:13:17,001 --> 01:13:18,332
Russell:                        
Julia!                          

1293
01:13:19,867 --> 01:13:22,098
          Um, just another dish.

1294
01:13:27,867 --> 01:13:29,965
Forget the vegetables, darling, 

1295
01:13:30,034 --> 01:13:33,365
      I've got something        
        better for you.         

1296
01:13:35,634 --> 01:13:36,865
                          Julia!

1297
01:13:36,934 --> 01:13:38,865
Russell!                        
Where did you come from?        

1298
01:13:38,934 --> 01:13:41,198
              Timothy, your son,
        he told me what you did.

1299
01:13:41,267 --> 01:13:42,232
 Thomas.                        

1300
01:13:43,334 --> 01:13:45,232
   You-you brought mr. Templeton
                    our samples?

1301
01:13:45,300 --> 01:13:48,999
                   The tenacity,
           the ambition of that!

1302
01:13:49,067 --> 01:13:50,565
                Congratulations.

1303
01:13:50,634 --> 01:13:52,965
Ha ha ha!                       

1304
01:13:53,034 --> 01:13:55,499
We've won, russell.             

1305
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:58,098
              Oh, this calls for
                  a celebration.

1306
01:13:58,167 --> 01:13:59,865
              Let's get married.

1307
01:13:59,934 --> 01:14:01,332
What?                           

1308
01:14:01,401 --> 01:14:03,899
           You want spontaneous?
      I'll give you spontaneous!

1309
01:14:03,967 --> 01:14:07,165
           Is there a justice of
              the peace in here?

1310
01:14:07,234 --> 01:14:09,132
Get married now?                

1311
01:14:09,200 --> 01:14:12,432
I think it's a wonderful idea.  
           Isn't it?            

1312
01:14:12,501 --> 01:14:15,232
         Well, I think that's...

1313
01:14:15,300 --> 01:14:17,365
                    Up to julia.

1314
01:14:17,434 --> 01:14:19,899
No, no, no.                     

1315
01:14:19,967 --> 01:14:21,399
I can't get married.            

1316
01:14:21,467 --> 01:14:22,765
Not without my sons here.       

1317
01:14:22,834 --> 01:14:25,532
            Let's surprise them.

1318
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:27,465
No. No. They hate surprises.    

1319
01:14:27,534 --> 01:14:29,499
They always say,                
"mom, please don't              
surprise us."                   

1320
01:14:29,567 --> 01:14:32,165
We'll have to wait.             

1321
01:14:32,234 --> 01:14:34,698
           Until tomorrow, then?

1322
01:14:34,767 --> 01:14:35,999
Tomorrow?                       
                       Tomorrow!

1323
01:14:54,534 --> 01:14:56,332
Hey, dad.                       

1324
01:14:56,401 --> 01:14:57,332
             Hey.               

1325
01:14:57,401 --> 01:14:59,132
Dad, why don't we               
go to the beach?                

1326
01:14:59,200 --> 01:15:00,399
The waves are                   
totally great today.            

1327
01:15:00,467 --> 01:15:01,899
      Yeah, we should go.       

1328
01:15:01,967 --> 01:15:03,965
I'll go get my suit.            

1329
01:15:04,034 --> 01:15:05,432
    No, I mean leave here.      

1330
01:15:05,501 --> 01:15:07,698
What?                           

1331
01:15:07,767 --> 01:15:09,132
                            Why?

1332
01:15:09,200 --> 01:15:10,798
        I don't want to         
       be here anymore.         

1333
01:15:10,867 --> 01:15:11,965
          Excuse me.            

1334
01:15:12,034 --> 01:15:13,965
But it's not time               
to leave yet.                   

1335
01:15:14,034 --> 01:15:15,265
           ( sighs )            

1336
01:15:15,334 --> 01:15:17,098
      Go pack your bags.        

1337
01:15:17,167 --> 01:15:19,332
But I don't want to go!         

1338
01:15:19,401 --> 01:15:21,432
    I said pack your bags!      

1339
01:15:21,501 --> 01:15:23,032
      You hear me? Move!        

1340
01:15:23,100 --> 01:15:25,765
      Ah, louis, come on,       

1341
01:15:25,834 --> 01:15:27,432
        Wait a minute--         
          I didn't--            

1342
01:15:27,501 --> 01:15:31,298
                  Is it that bad
                  being with u  

1343
01:15:31,367 --> 01:15:35,399
Daphne, it's not                
about you and louis.            

1344
01:15:35,467 --> 01:15:36,798
Okay?                           

1345
01:15:40,234 --> 01:15:42,232
Hang on, will ya?               

1346
01:15:47,800 --> 01:15:49,165
    ( sighs )                   

1347
01:15:53,634 --> 01:15:54,565
                        Hey.    

1348
01:16:03,567 --> 01:16:05,532
     Russell's a good man.      

1349
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:07,798
       Solid. Reliable.         

1350
01:16:07,867 --> 01:16:11,432
Sounds like                     
you're buying a car.            

1351
01:16:11,501 --> 01:16:14,298
                    I like matt.

1352
01:16:14,367 --> 01:16:15,999
We thought                      
you liked him.                  

1353
01:16:16,067 --> 01:16:19,698
       Matt-matt's fi           
        for a few weeks         
        on a vacation.          

1354
01:16:19,767 --> 01:16:21,899
      A person like that        
        in real life...         

1355
01:16:21,967 --> 01:16:24,132
    Gets tiring real quick.     

1356
01:16:24,200 --> 01:16:26,899
And russell?                    

1357
01:16:26,967 --> 01:16:28,532
                   He'll put you
                       to sleep.

1358
01:16:28,600 --> 01:16:30,798
        You know what,          
           you guys?            

1359
01:16:30,867 --> 01:16:33,232
     I'm marrying russell.      

1360
01:16:33,300 --> 01:16:34,899
  I'm not gonna get involved    

1361
01:16:34,967 --> 01:16:36,965
       With another man         
  who walks out on his kids.    

1362
01:16:50,634 --> 01:16:53,065
                           Matt:
                            Hey.

1363
01:16:53,134 --> 01:16:55,499
            Come on, let's walk.

1364
01:16:58,034 --> 01:16:59,798
    Look, I wanted to leave     

1365
01:16:59,867 --> 01:17:02,999
      Because I feel like       
       we're intruding,         

1366
01:17:03,067 --> 01:17:05,265
    It's got nothing to do      
      with either of you.       

1367
01:17:05,334 --> 01:17:08,532
You know this is                
the only time                   
we spend together.              

1368
01:17:08,600 --> 01:17:09,965
         No it's not.           

1369
01:17:10,034 --> 01:17:12,165
Yes it is,                      
and you know that.              

1370
01:17:12,234 --> 01:17:15,232
    We've had a great trip,     
          haven't we?           

1371
01:17:15,300 --> 01:17:18,632
       I mean, we've had        
     a lot of fun, right?       

1372
01:17:18,700 --> 01:17:20,499
                           Yeah.

1373
01:17:20,567 --> 01:17:23,598
                    We come here
                and we jump into
                the stupid ocean

1374
01:17:23,667 --> 01:17:25,899
                  And play house
          for a couple of weeks,

1375
01:17:25,967 --> 01:17:28,399
  And that's supposed to last us
           the rest of the year?

1376
01:17:28,467 --> 01:17:32,432
           Why don't you want to
                be with us, dad?

1377
01:17:32,501 --> 01:17:34,399
             I do.              

1378
01:17:34,467 --> 01:17:36,298
You have a funny way            
of showing it.                  

1379
01:17:36,367 --> 01:17:39,532
        Come on, guys,          
        you know I want         
        to be with you.         

1380
01:17:39,600 --> 01:17:43,132
            When it's convenient
              for your schedule.

1381
01:17:43,200 --> 01:17:45,332
     How can you say that?      

1382
01:17:45,401 --> 01:17:47,632
              Because it's true.

1383
01:17:47,700 --> 01:17:51,032
      You keep saying next week,
        next month, next year...

1384
01:17:51,100 --> 01:17:53,798
                     What are we
              supposed to think?

1385
01:17:56,934 --> 01:18:00,832
      Look, I'll make it        
     up to you, I promise.      

1386
01:18:00,901 --> 01:18:03,232
               You don't have to
               make it up to us,

1387
01:18:03,300 --> 01:18:05,832
                  Just be there.

1388
01:18:05,901 --> 01:18:09,565
                  Be our father.

1389
01:18:09,634 --> 01:18:11,232
           ( sighs )            

1390
01:18:17,134 --> 01:18:18,798
Tt, this is yours. Matt--       
                          ha ha.

1391
01:18:21,700 --> 01:18:25,198
               It was big of you
         to cut your trip short.

1392
01:18:25,267 --> 01:18:27,565
I wouldn't want to              
rain on your honeymoon.         

1393
01:18:37,867 --> 01:18:40,132
You're a lucky man.             

1394
01:18:40,200 --> 01:18:41,932
                         I know.

1395
01:18:49,734 --> 01:18:51,798
Max, I can't take that.         

1396
01:18:51,867 --> 01:18:55,098
I mean, I-I don't even          
have anythg to give to you.     

1397
01:18:55,167 --> 01:18:57,198
               It's okay, louis,
                you already did.

1398
01:19:05,967 --> 01:19:07,999
                    Thanks, max.

1399
01:19:16,300 --> 01:19:18,332
Hey.                            
                           Hey. 

1400
01:19:18,401 --> 01:19:22,265
So, um, call me when

1401
01:19:22,334 --> 01:19:24,332
     Yeah, same wityour boobs.  

1402
01:19:24,401 --> 01:19:26,399

calling you first.              

1403
01:19:28,901 --> 01:19:30,732
               Stay weird, daph.

1404
01:19:30,800 --> 01:19:32,899
          Strange works for you.

1405
01:19:49,367 --> 01:19:49,432

01:19:53,367 --> 01:19:54,698
Catch you later, man.           

1407
01:19:54,767 --> 01:19:56,399
                      Take care.

1408
01:19:58,734 --> 01:20:00,632
                        I just--

1409
01:20:00,700 --> 01:20:01,765
Sure.                           

1410
01:20:13,334 --> 01:20:15,098
            Thanks.             

1411
01:20:17,034 --> 01:20:18,698
                         Thomas.

1412
01:20:18,767 --> 01:20:21,265
         Remember, always go for
                  what you want,

1413
01:20:21,334 --> 01:20:23,432
      And be kind to the ladies.

1414
01:20:23,501 --> 01:20:24,598
'bye, julia.                    

1415
01:20:24,667 --> 01:20:25,765
'bye, sweetie.                  

1416
01:20:25,834 --> 01:20:28,465
                     Max! Ha ha!
           Keep on sailing, boy.

1417
01:20:28,534 --> 01:20:30,765
                    But be safe.

1418
01:20:30,834 --> 01:20:32,198
Ye, sweetheart.                 

1419
01:20:32,267 --> 01:20:33,932
          Thanks for everything.

1420
01:20:37,067 --> 01:20:38,665
Thank you.                      

1421
01:20:47,467 --> 01:20:50,098
Daphne told me                  
about your plans.               

1422
01:20:50,167 --> 01:20:53,598
  Oh, yeah, we're gonna look for
   a 3-bedroom when we get back.

1423
01:20:53,667 --> 01:20:56,532
         Figure I need my kids  
                 around me to...

1424
01:20:56,600 --> 01:20:59,298
                Keep me in line.

1425
01:21:00,734 --> 01:21:03,632
I'm happy for you, matt.        

1426
01:21:11,234 --> 01:21:13,365
         I'm happy for you, too.

1427
01:21:14,200 --> 01:21:15,532
           Russell:             
            Julia.              

1428
01:21:15,600 --> 01:21:18,465
       I told the judge         
     we'd be there at two.      

1429
01:21:18,534 --> 01:21:22,565
Two, two-fifteen,               
what's the difference?          

1430
01:21:24,067 --> 01:21:26,698
Let's go.                       

1431
01:21:26,767 --> 01:21:28,198
Come on.                        

1432
01:21:34,067 --> 01:21:35,965
Russell:                        
Can't keep him waiting.         

1433
01:21:39,100 --> 01:21:40,832
Hey, max!                       

1434
01:21:40,901 --> 01:21:43,532
I'm gonna keep an eye on you!   

1435
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:45,665
                         Daphne:
          Louis, get in the car.

1436
01:21:45,734 --> 01:21:47,365
            Thomas:             
     See you later, guys.       

1437
01:21:47,434 --> 01:21:48,698
Daphne:                         
'bye!                           

1438
01:22:11,266 --> 01:22:13,598

1440
01:22:20,700 --> 01:22:22,598
   You are so lucky, julia.     

1441
01:22:22,667 --> 01:22:24,732
        You found a man         
    who loves you for you.      

1442
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:27,965
   You share the same work,     
      the same interests.       

1443
01:22:29,001 --> 01:22:32,598
            Judge:              
 Can we get going now, please?  

1444
01:22:32,667 --> 01:22:33,832
        Shall we begin?         

1445
01:22:33,901 --> 01:22:35,132
    Yes.                        

1446
01:22:35,200 --> 01:22:38,499
  Sir, the eggplant. Please.    

1447
01:22:38,567 --> 01:22:39,932
           What? Oh.            

1448
01:22:40,001 --> 01:22:42,465
                      Oh, right.

1449
01:22:42,534 --> 01:22:43,832
                     Well...    

1450
01:22:43,901 --> 01:22:44,832
        ( sputtering )          

1451
01:22:44,901 --> 01:22:46,899
                Just be careful.

1452
01:22:48,067 --> 01:22:49,732
            So now can we begin?

1453
01:22:49,800 --> 01:22:51,132
    Yes.                        
                           Yes.

1455
01:22:55,134 --> 01:22:58,532
           Russell:             
 Boys, I need some quiet here.  

1456
01:23:00,100 --> 01:23:01,765
   Boys, what are you doing?    

1457
01:23:03,234 --> 01:23:04,232
              No!               

1458
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:07,432
      Catch it! Catch it        

1459
01:23:11,501 --> 01:23:13,032
           Russell:             
      He's irreplaceable!       

1460
01:23:16,401 --> 01:23:18,265
   Oh, my god, the chlorine!    

1461
01:23:18,334 --> 01:23:19,399
Russell, save max!              

1462
01:23:24,901 --> 01:23:27,198
            Thomas:             
           Max! Max!            

1463
01:23:29,001 --> 01:23:30,798
Max! Here, max!                 

1464
01:23:34,200 --> 01:23:35,732
You went for the eggplant!      

1465
01:23:35,800 --> 01:23:37,098
                    He can swim!

1466
01:23:37,167 --> 01:23:39,732
                 Quick, take it,
   the chlorine's gonna ruin it!

1467
01:23:41,734 --> 01:23:45,798
                Some fresh water
            and a towel for him.

1468
01:23:45,867 --> 01:23:48,999
I hope you two will be          
very happy together.            

1469
01:23:50,634 --> 01:23:52,399
       ( all laughing )         

1470
01:23:52,467 --> 01:23:54,198
         Guys, you did          
       a very good job.         

1471
01:23:55,200 --> 01:23:57,632
See you later, russell.         

1472
01:23:57,700 --> 01:24:01,932
              Wha-- toby! Timmy!
                          Tommy!

1473
01:24:02,001 --> 01:24:03,832
                       Tony!    

1474
01:24:05,600 --> 01:24:08,032
          Oh, my baby, oh...    

1475
01:24:08,100 --> 01:24:12,798
       Oh, no, oh no, oh....    

1476
01:24:15,634 --> 01:24:18,098
        Oh, she's delicious.    

1477
01:24:23,667 --> 01:24:25,399
          Well, guys,           

1478
01:24:25,467 --> 01:24:27,499
    If we're gonna do this,     
   we better get organized.     

1479
01:24:27,567 --> 01:24:31,532
           You know?            
 Make some schedules, lists...  

1480
01:24:33,534 --> 01:24:35,265
Since when do you eat tomatoes? 

1481
01:24:35,334 --> 01:24:37,965
        Julia said it's a fruit.

1482
01:24:42,534 --> 01:24:44,132
We're never gonna               
make this ferry.                

1483
01:24:44,200 --> 01:24:46,432
                   Yes, we will.

1484
01:24:46,501 --> 01:24:47,632
     ( tires screeching )       

1485
01:24:55,134 --> 01:24:55,932
          ( honking )           

1486
01:24:56,001 --> 01:24:58,465
            Julia!!             

1487
01:25:04,367 --> 01:25:05,698
                   Hiya, cookie.

1488
01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:08,965
You cut in line.                

1489
01:25:09,034 --> 01:25:10,832
                          I did.

1490
01:25:10,901 --> 01:25:14,165
           Sometimes you have to
    to get where you want to be.

1491
01:25:14,234 --> 01:25:16,798
   seems like forever now     

1492
01:25:16,867 --> 01:25:19,365
     since you went away      

1493
01:25:19,434 --> 01:25:21,999
   and in the quiet times     

1494
01:25:22,067 --> 01:25:24,032
     I can hear you say       

1495
01:25:24,100 --> 01:25:31,732
       hold on, and I'll       
      come back to you         

1496
01:25:31,800 --> 01:25:33,565
     that's when you say      

1497
01:25:33,634 --> 01:25:35,798
      but for a minute        

1498
01:25:35,867 --> 01:25:38,365
       I could look into       
      two nervous eyes         

1499
01:25:38,434 --> 01:25:42,432
        and go away to         
      some other place         

1500
01:25:42,501 --> 01:25:44,965
     and some other time    

1501
01:25:45,034 --> 01:25:49,065
  can't you hear me calling   

1502
01:25:49,134 --> 01:25:51,899
         oh, by...
