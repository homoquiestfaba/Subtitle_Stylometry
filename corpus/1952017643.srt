You don"t have a phone,
you ain"t got shit.

5
00:00:53,924 --> 00:00:55,050
All you got was lost.

11
00:01:27,824 --> 00:01:29,018

13
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:32,184

Is him.

26
00:06:25,355 --> 00:06:26,879
I asked for it

You ain't payin' me,

00:06:41,371 --> 00:06:43,805
Why'd you have
to go and do
that, man?

35
00:06:43,873 --> 00:06:45,932
We need to discuss
my job description.

00:06:57,253 --> 00:06:58,880
That"s what you

00:07:23,346 --> 00:07:25,075
You better change

56
00:07:28,384 --> 00:07:29,715
Look man,

57
00:07:29,786 --> 00:07:31,777
But l"m frustrated
with this shit here.

58
00:07:31,854 --> 00:07:33,947
Belng frustrated
Is just part
of the job.

59
00:07:34,023 --> 00:07:36,218
You do this,

a better gig.

00:07:36,292 --> 00:07:37,816
Stay in there

It"s all gratifying.

I'm not Interested
In spendlng the rest

00:07:41,831 --> 00:07:44,698
as a fucking wet nurse
to a bunch of broke dick
cocksuckers on the road.

64
00:07:44,767 --> 00:07:46,394
I don"t know
what you trippin" for.

65
00:07:46,469 --> 00:07:48,334
I don"t know why

70
00:07:57,013 --> 00:07:58,674
This life ain"t
in me anymore.

71
00:07:58,748 --> 00:08:00,978
I need a new life
far away from
this shit.

72
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:02,813
Don"t get
me wrong.

73
00:08:02,885 --> 00:08:04,944
I appreclate everythlng
that you done
for me.

74
00:08:05,021 --> 00:08:06,113
I know It's
been a lot.

75
00:08:06,189 --> 00:08:07,850
But it"s time for
me to move on.

76
00:08:07,924 --> 00:08:09,323
It aln't that
easy, plmp.

77
00:08:09,392 --> 00:08:11,690
When you did
your full five calendars,

78
00:08:11,761 --> 00:08:14,127
soon as you touched
down on the floor,

79
00:08:14,197 --> 00:08:16,392
I pushed you
in the game,
I gave you a lifeline,

80
00:08:16,466 --> 00:08:19,435
I gave you a know,
I gave you a mouth
to mouth resuscitation.

81
00:08:19,502 --> 00:08:21,299

In thls shlt, man.

85
00:08:27,777 --> 00:08:29,176

cord, pimp.

86
00:08:29,245 --> 00:08:32,806
What are

One more job?

87
00:08:34,117 --> 00:08:36,085
One more job
and it"s done.

88
00:08:36,152 --> 00:08:38,120
There it
is then.

89
00:08:38,187 --> 00:08:39,313
Awright?

90
00:08:39,389 --> 00:08:40,413
A wrlght.

91
00:09:06,582 --> 00:09:09,346
Yo man, how much
longer we gotta do
this shit for a dog?

92
00:09:09,419 --> 00:09:11,284
Till we can prove
we can hold
our own.

93
00:09:11,354 --> 00:09:13,618
l"m pulling a stack
a day already.

94
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:17,626
I told you I got
my boy Malcom
working on some shit.

95
00:09:17,694 --> 00:09:20,162
If it pops,
we"re all on.

96
00:09:20,229 --> 00:09:21,594

What"s going, man?

102
00:09:29,172 --> 00:09:30,799
Boss man said
be on the lookout.

103
00:09:30,873 --> 00:09:32,397
It might get
hot today.

104
00:09:32,475 --> 00:09:33,339
You need a re-up?

105
00:09:33,409 --> 00:09:34,637

We got some
shit going on.

109
00:09:40,917 --> 00:09:43,545
Stop whining like
a bitch and get
this money.

110
00:09:43,619 --> 00:09:45,314
Why you always
worrying and shit?

111
00:09:45,388 --> 00:09:46,787
As soon as
something pop on,

112
00:09:46,856 --> 00:09:48,619
you"s gonna be
the first person
to know.

113
00:09:48,691 --> 00:09:50,716
Yeah, stop whining
like a little bitch.

114
00:09:50,793 --> 00:09:51,953
Hold the fuck up.

115
00:09:56,065 --> 00:09:58,158
Brush your teeth.
Your breath sucks.

116
00:09:58,234 --> 00:10:00,134
Where's cousln
Malcolm anyway?

117
00:10:00,203 --> 00:10:01,898
Who knows?

118
00:10:01,971 --> 00:10:03,905
Damn, look at
the llttle glrl.

119
00:10:07,243 --> 00:10:08,574
So, why are
you here?

120
00:10:08,644 --> 00:10:10,168
Here for
a visit.

121
00:10:10,246 --> 00:10:12,441
Why you always think
everybody wants
something from you?

122
00:10:12,515 --> 00:10:14,107
Most people
come here
for a visit.

123
00:10:14,183 --> 00:10:15,445
Either want
something,

124
00:10:15,518 --> 00:10:17,611
or they think
they"re doing
me a favor.

125
00:10:17,687 --> 00:10:18,881
Which is it?

126
00:10:20,623 --> 00:10:23,786
U ncle, I wanna ask you
a couple of questions
about something.

127
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:26,693
That shit you talked
about the last time
I came to see you.

128
00:10:26,763 --> 00:10:28,788
What shit?

129
00:10:28,865 --> 00:10:31,390
l"m tired of hustling
the streets.

130
00:10:31,467 --> 00:10:33,992
If I don"t hit
a big score soon,

131
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:36,868
l"m gonna wind up
just like you.
No offense.

132
00:10:36,939 --> 00:10:39,407
You still runnin"
with that crew workin"
for H ustler?

133
00:10:39,475 --> 00:10:41,170
Yeah, we tired
of the street shit.

134
00:10:41,244 --> 00:10:42,438
l"m ready
to move up.

135
00:10:42,512 --> 00:10:44,309
I want a better life
than this for me.

136
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:45,972
So what do
you want
from me?

137
00:10:46,048 --> 00:10:48,949
A while back, I heard
you talk about this
thing in Maysville.

138
00:10:49,018 --> 00:10:50,918
A bank no one
had ever robbed.

139
00:10:50,987 --> 00:10:52,648
Yeah, I never
got to that one.

140
00:10:52,722 --> 00:10:53,984
That one
got away.

141
00:10:54,056 --> 00:10:55,580
I was wondering.

142
00:10:55,658 --> 00:10:57,922
Wondering?

143
00:10:57,994 --> 00:11:00,963
Maybe you can
tell me that
story again.

144
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:02,622
But this time
with a few
more details.

145
00:11:02,698 --> 00:11:03,824
Why would
I want to do that?

146
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,595
Because this could
put me on!

147
00:11:05,668 --> 00:11:07,533
Plus you ain"t goin"
anywhere for a while.

148
00:11:07,603 --> 00:11:08,797
True.

149
00:11:08,871 --> 00:11:10,771
I could use
a score llke thls.

150
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,398
Get me off
of these corners.

151
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:15,038
Fine.

152
00:11:15,111 --> 00:11:17,045
You wanna go
from runnin"
to robbin",

153
00:11:17,113 --> 00:11:18,410
that"s fine.

154
00:11:18,481 --> 00:11:20,506
But you better
put together
a good crew.

155
00:11:20,583 --> 00:11:22,551
If you don"t,
you spend
the rest

156
00:11:22,618 --> 00:11:24,176
of your days
staring at bricks.

157
00:11:25,321 --> 00:11:26,253
You got that?

158
00:11:26,322 --> 00:11:27,084
Yessir.

159
00:11:29,559 --> 00:11:31,459

Now listen.

160
00:11:31,527 --> 00:11:35,987
This bank isn"t
just an ordinary bank.

162
00:11:43,339 --> 00:11:46,172

Find a way

that, man.

173
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:27,510
Oalm your ass down

185
00:12:46,636 --> 00:12:49,036
Never heard
of a business lunch?

186
00:12:49,105 --> 00:12:51,039
Yo, finally!

187
00:12:51,107 --> 00:12:53,041

O"mon dawg,

00:12:56,746 --> 00:12:58,509
with crackheads
all day.
What up, Bone?

191
00:12:58,581 --> 00:13:00,640
[inaudible]

192
00:13:00,716 --> 00:13:02,115
Scoot your ass
over, man.

193
00:13:02,184 --> 00:13:03,583
You gonna take
my seat, man?

194
00:13:03,653 --> 00:13:06,087
H ustle know
where you all at?

195
00:13:06,155 --> 00:13:10,285
No, I told him
we had some baby
mam drama.

196
00:13:10,359 --> 00:13:11,792
So what"s up, man?

197
00:13:11,861 --> 00:13:16,321
Besides being like
that for 25 more,
I guess good.

198
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:18,697
Y"all ain"t
gonna believe
what he told me.

199
00:13:21,037 --> 00:13:23,062
Don"t keep
a nigga
in suspense.

200
00:13:23,139 --> 00:13:25,801
Listen. He told me
about a bank
in Maysville.

201
00:13:25,875 --> 00:13:28,105
But it"s not just
an average bank.

202
00:13:28,177 --> 00:13:29,940
It"s a holding depot.

203
00:13:30,012 --> 00:13:32,810
Man, what
the fuck is
a holding depot?

204
00:13:32,882 --> 00:13:35,373
Klnda llke
at Cutty.

205
00:13:35,451 --> 00:13:37,316
You got
the stash spot
for the stuff.

206
00:13:37,386 --> 00:13:39,911
Well, this bank
is a stash spot
for other banks.

207
00:13:39,989 --> 00:13:42,651
How many banks
stash their
dough there?

208
00:13:42,725 --> 00:13:44,056
I don"t know
but he told me

209
00:13:44,126 --> 00:13:46,594
it"s an easy two
or three million.

210
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:49,056
Yessir.

211
00:13:49,131 --> 00:13:50,393
We gotta get
that dough for real.

212
00:13:50,466 --> 00:13:52,696
He told me the layout
of the bank,

213
00:13:52,768 --> 00:13:54,395
the streets, all that stuff.

214
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:56,199
If we get some serious artillery,

215
00:13:56,272 --> 00:13:58,797
we should be able to walk in and
walk out. Easy.

216
00:13:58,874 --> 00:14:00,842
It can"t be that easy.

217
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:03,242
My uncle robbed 22 banks before
he got caught.

218
00:14:03,312 --> 00:14:05,780
If he says it"s easy,
l"m inclined to
believe him.

219
00:14:05,848 --> 00:14:09,284
So this is what you motherfuckers
been talkin' about.

220
00:14:09,352 --> 00:14:11,081
Tell me you got
an easy ass plan.

221
00:14:11,153 --> 00:14:16,420
The way I see it
we"re going there
Friday afternoon late.

222
00:14:16,492 --> 00:14:19,120
Right before the bank closes up for
the weekend.

223
00:14:19,195 --> 00:14:21,789
We go in, we go out.

224
00:14:21,864 --> 00:14:23,297
We gotta get them guns.

225
00:14:23,366 --> 00:14:26,028
This is a motherfucking bank, dog.

226
00:14:26,102 --> 00:14:28,002
Where we gonna get that kind of firepower?

227
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:29,435
Good question.

228
00:14:29,505 --> 00:14:31,166
I was thinkin" Hustle.

229
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,674
Hustle? You remember what
happened last time?

230
00:14:33,743 --> 00:14:35,540
He tried to take that fucking risk.

231
00:14:35,611 --> 00:14:38,045
Can"t be riskier than the shit
we been doin".

232
00:14:38,114 --> 00:14:41,106
Out on the streets,
sellin" for this nigga.

233
00:14:41,183 --> 00:14:43,048
For this kind of payoff,

234
00:14:43,119 --> 00:14:45,679
l"m willin" to take that risk for real.

235
00:14:45,755 --> 00:14:48,724
I don"t plan on dying
in the streets like
everybody else.

236
00:14:48,791 --> 00:14:51,021
l"m trying to live my life.

237
00:14:52,795 --> 00:14:54,387
I hear you.

238
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:55,953
Man, that was beautiful, dog.

239
00:14:56,032 --> 00:14:58,125
Sound like a damn after school special.

240
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,861
Shut your ass.

241
00:14:59,935 --> 00:15:02,563
I was just lettin"
him know it
was beautiful.

242
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:52,744
Heat It up.

243
00:15:54,724 --> 00:15:57,056
Steam It up
a llttle blt.

244
00:15:57,126 --> 00:16:00,562
More attitude,
more attitude,
more attitude.

245
00:16:08,838 --> 00:16:10,806
And... cut.

246
00:16:10,873 --> 00:16:13,808
We"ll continue
in a few minutes.

247
00:16:13,876 --> 00:16:17,403
What"s going
on fellas?

248
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:20,278
Sorry to
Interrupt, man.

249
00:16:20,349 --> 00:16:22,283
It"s good.Just my new
side business.

250
00:16:22,351 --> 00:16:24,683
Good money in lesbians!

251
00:16:24,754 --> 00:16:26,483
l"m not a lesbian, motherfucker.

252
00:16:26,555 --> 00:16:27,613
I llke dlck, too.

253
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:28,748
l"ll keep that in mind.

254
00:16:32,495 --> 00:16:34,053
You supposed to be holdin" down Outty.

255
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:36,963
l"m here to provide you with a business
opportunity though.

256
00:16:37,032 --> 00:16:39,523
Last time you presented me with an opportunlty,

257
00:16:39,602 --> 00:16:42,571
MacHenry went to jail and Young got shot
in the finger.

258
00:16:42,638 --> 00:16:46,734
We had no idea that nigga was Vice.

259
00:16:46,809 --> 00:16:48,936
You"re always fucking off a good thing.

260
00:16:49,011 --> 00:16:51,241
We had the shit laid out, y"all
fucked it off.

261
00:16:51,313 --> 00:16:54,942
Trust me on this one, I got you.

262
00:16:55,017 --> 00:16:57,281
I got this new job that l"m working on,

263
00:16:57,353 --> 00:16:58,945
all I need is firepower.

264
00:16:59,021 --> 00:16:59,988
What kind?

265
00:17:00,055 --> 00:17:01,955
Something for each of us.

266
00:17:02,024 --> 00:17:04,049
Something to put the fear of
god into these niggas hearts.

267
00:17:04,126 --> 00:17:08,995
Some bin ladens?
Some mini 14s?
Some mp5s?

268
00:17:09,064 --> 00:17:10,395
All that.

269
00:17:10,466 --> 00:17:12,297
Okay, okay. Who your
wheel man?

270
00:17:12,368 --> 00:17:13,426
Bone here.

271
00:17:13,502 --> 00:17:15,231
Know how
to drlve?

272
00:17:15,304 --> 00:17:17,738
We don't need no square motherfuckers behind the wheel.

273
00:17:17,807 --> 00:17:19,297
You better know
how to scoot.

274
00:17:19,375 --> 00:17:20,603
I can handle
this shit.

275
00:17:20,676 --> 00:17:23,474
It's cool, for real.

276
00:17:26,549 --> 00:17:28,949
Okay.
How big Is the job?

277
00:17:29,018 --> 00:17:31,043
The job,
big big.

278
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,315
Give me
the details.

279
00:17:33,389 --> 00:17:36,256
Let"s just worry
about that money.

280
00:17:36,325 --> 00:17:39,385
Shit, I don't remember getting paid for the
last one, did you?

281
00:17:39,461 --> 00:17:41,088
We just went through that.

282
00:17:41,163 --> 00:17:43,188
Why bring up old shit?

283
00:17:43,265 --> 00:17:44,527
You know I got caught.

284
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,397
Why you get boisterous?

285
00:17:46,468 --> 00:17:47,799
l"ll take your top off.

286
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:49,497
That last shit wasn"t my fault.

287
00:17:49,572 --> 00:17:51,267
I laid that shit out for you.

288
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:53,570
The shit went sour,
you fucked it up.

289
00:17:53,642 --> 00:17:56,338
I gave you the crew.
Look at my partner"s finger, man.

290
00:17:56,412 --> 00:17:59,245
Trigger finger fucked off.

291
00:17:59,315 --> 00:18:02,307
What"s it gonna take
to make up for
the other shit?

292
00:18:02,384 --> 00:18:03,851
A percentage.

293
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:05,477
Since when?

294
00:18:05,554 --> 00:18:08,352
Since I found out my cousin made
it big in the music biz.

295
00:18:08,424 --> 00:18:11,916
They kick'n they feet like they on fire and takin'
risk no more.

296
00:18:11,994 --> 00:18:15,896
They takin" percentages and that"s what l"m
gonna start doin".

297
00:18:15,965 --> 00:18:17,091
That"s bullshit.

298
00:18:17,166 --> 00:18:18,360
Fuck you.

299
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:22,865
You want help?
Give me a cut.

300
00:18:22,938 --> 00:18:24,735
Name it.

301
00:18:24,807 --> 00:18:26,536
Twenty percent plus what you
owe me.

302
00:18:26,609 --> 00:18:28,076
You out of your
motherfuckin" mind!

303
00:18:28,143 --> 00:18:31,544
You out of line.

304
00:18:31,614 --> 00:18:34,105
My fault, dog.

305
00:18:34,183 --> 00:18:37,516
Oh, 20% is too much.
l"m only getting
some guns.

306
00:18:37,586 --> 00:18:39,451
But you already
owe me.

307
00:18:39,521 --> 00:18:43,890
Wages, ball and legal,
how you put a price
on my homeboy flnger?

308
00:18:45,828 --> 00:18:46,954
Five percent.

309
00:18:47,029 --> 00:18:48,553
Ten percent.

310
00:18:52,835 --> 00:18:55,235
That"s a deal.

311
00:18:55,304 --> 00:18:57,272
Don't disappoint me.

312
00:18:57,339 --> 00:19:00,001
You know what happened
to the last motherfucker
that disappolnted me?

313
00:19:00,075 --> 00:19:03,408
He got his
top took off.

314
00:19:03,479 --> 00:19:06,243
come by tomorrow
and l"ll have what
you need.

315
00:19:06,315 --> 00:19:07,805

lt"s cool, man.

318
00:19:13,055 --> 00:19:14,249
It"s all gravity.

319
00:19:14,323 --> 00:19:16,757
These niggas crazy?

320
00:19:16,825 --> 00:19:18,292
Young, ambitious,
and hungry

321
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,555
but at the same
time green.

322
00:19:20,629 --> 00:19:22,256
What we gonna
do about them then?

323
00:19:22,331 --> 00:19:24,765
l"m gonna call
a favor.

324
00:19:42,751 --> 00:19:44,582
I know this
ain"t a motel.

325
00:19:44,653 --> 00:19:46,086
Yeah.

326
00:19:46,155 --> 00:19:48,123
Where the fuck

327
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:52,149
We gotta be the scarlest
motherfuckers around here.

328

You glvln' out

00:19:59,935 --> 00:20:01,402
You"re late.

331
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:03,301
Who the fuck you supposed to be?

332
00:20:03,372 --> 00:20:05,863

333
00:20:05,941 --> 00:20:07,465

See me laughing?

335
00:20:09,111 --> 00:20:11,238
Thls Is gettin'

336
00:20:11,313 --> 00:20:12,940
He already got
me for 10%.

337
00:20:13,015 --> 00:20:15,142
l"ll be damned
if we split
five ways.

338
00:20:15,217 --> 00:20:16,878
That wasn"t part
of the plan.

339
00:20:16,952 --> 00:20:18,476
Look, kid...
plans change.

340
00:20:18,554 --> 00:20:19,953
Kid?

341
00:20:20,022 --> 00:20:21,853

00:20:21,924 --> 00:20:23,687

the decisions.

343

Well, guess what?
You don"t.

344
00:20:25,794 --> 00:20:27,625
The decision"s
already been made.

345
00:20:27,696 --> 00:20:31,029
So go ahead
and get behlnd
lt... qulckly.

00:20:32,935 --> 00:20:34,994

403
00:23:10,058 --> 00:23:12,219
Ooh, a big city.

404
00:23:12,294 --> 00:23:13,454
Yeah, it is.

405
00:23:13,529 --> 00:23:15,019
So what brings
you to Maysville?

406
00:23:16,398 --> 00:23:17,763
You sure do ask
a lot of questions.

407
00:23:17,833 --> 00:23:20,301
Yeah, I do.
That"s my job.

408
00:23:20,369 --> 00:23:21,836
J ust wanted
to get away,

409
00:23:21,904 --> 00:23:23,838
a little slower pace.

410
00:23:23,906 --> 00:23:27,740
Well, a city that size,
you oughtta try
a whole lot quieter.

411
00:23:27,809 --> 00:23:29,868
That"s just
fine by me.

412
00:23:29,945 --> 00:23:31,742
You got a place to stay?

413
00:23:31,813 --> 00:23:33,644
No, not yet,
not yet.

414
00:23:33,715 --> 00:23:36,377
If you need anything,
don"t be afraid
to ask.

415
00:23:36,451 --> 00:23:38,316
l"ll do that.

416
00:23:38,387 --> 00:23:40,014
You have
a nice day.

417
00:23:40,088 --> 00:23:41,646
You too.

418
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:49,854
Who was that?

419
00:23:49,932 --> 00:23:51,297
A new neighbor.

420
00:23:51,366 --> 00:23:54,733
Oh yeah?
Haven"t had one
of those in a while.

421
00:23:54,803 --> 00:23:57,863
No, we haven"t.
Let"s keep
an eye on him.

422
00:23:57,940 --> 00:23:59,635
See what we
can find out.

423
00:23:59,708 --> 00:24:01,073
Sure.

424
00:24:10,719 --> 00:24:12,619
We had a deal, Hustle.

425
00:24:12,688 --> 00:24:14,679
I don"t remember
anything about sending

426
00:24:14,756 --> 00:24:16,018
someone to watch
my back.

427
00:24:16,091 --> 00:24:17,558
Deals change, Skl.

428
00:24:17,626 --> 00:24:20,322
The way that last job
turned out that
I shot you,

429
00:24:20,395 --> 00:24:22,056
you smell
what l"m sayin"?

430
00:24:22,130 --> 00:24:24,360
I thought it best
to send someone
with experience.

431
00:24:24,433 --> 00:24:27,061
I can handle it.

432
00:24:27,135 --> 00:24:29,126
I don"t need
no fucking
chaperone, man.

433
00:24:29,204 --> 00:24:31,138
Adapt and
adjust, Ski.

434
00:24:31,206 --> 00:24:32,605
That"s all
you can do.

435
00:24:52,294 --> 00:24:53,989
Nice weapon.

436
00:24:54,062 --> 00:24:57,031
I own two.

437
00:24:57,099 --> 00:24:59,829
A little too much weight
in the tip for my taste.

438
00:24:59,901 --> 00:25:03,064
(H unter)
But that's what
glves It penetratlon.

439
00:25:04,373 --> 00:25:06,000
I wouldn"t know.

440
00:25:06,074 --> 00:25:07,564
You military?

441
00:25:07,643 --> 00:25:08,803
Used to be.

442
00:25:08,877 --> 00:25:11,869
A long time ago,
another life. You?

443
00:25:11,947 --> 00:25:14,677
Hell, yeah.
Gulf war
one, baby.

444
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:16,809
But not anymore,
I take it.

445
00:25:18,987 --> 00:25:21,182
Nah, not anymore.

446
00:25:21,256 --> 00:25:23,747
I dld my stlnt,

447
00:25:23,825 --> 00:25:26,817

other projects,

448
00:25:26,895 --> 00:25:28,658
top secret shit.

449
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:30,493
But then
they let me go.

450
00:25:30,565 --> 00:25:32,089
What do you hunt?

451
00:25:32,167 --> 00:25:33,498
What's that?

452
00:25:33,568 --> 00:25:34,830
What do you hunt?

453
00:25:34,903 --> 00:25:37,701
As in why you
shopping here?

454
00:25:37,773 --> 00:25:39,331
J ust taking
a look around.

455
00:25:39,408 --> 00:25:41,933
Maybe pick up
a few supplies.
You know.

456
00:25:42,010 --> 00:25:43,568
M mm.

457
00:25:43,645 --> 00:25:45,943
And then I guess
you gonna knock over
a bank and move on.

458
00:25:49,584 --> 00:25:50,608
J ust kidding.

459
00:25:50,686 --> 00:25:52,153
l"m here on
business myself.

460
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:54,586
I guess you gonna
tell me all about
that, right?

461
00:25:54,656 --> 00:25:55,520
Well, I could.

462
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:57,990
You seem trustworthy.

463
00:25:58,060 --> 00:25:59,425
Simplified and all.

464
00:26:00,862 --> 00:26:02,727
Besides, I doubt
you"d even believe me.

465
00:26:02,798 --> 00:26:05,358
Whatever gave
you that idea?

466
00:26:05,434 --> 00:26:09,029
Look, man.
I get it, okay?

467
00:26:09,104 --> 00:26:10,469
Let me tell
you something.

468
00:26:10,539 --> 00:26:12,404
l"ve seen some
shit in my day.

469
00:26:12,474 --> 00:26:14,271
l"m sure you
have too.

470
00:26:14,343 --> 00:26:19,178
But right now,
l"m onto something
really, really big.

471
00:26:19,247 --> 00:26:22,307
Something that
will blow your
fuckin" mind.

472
00:26:22,384 --> 00:26:23,817
Do tell.

473
00:26:23,885 --> 00:26:25,580
Let"s just
say this.

474
00:26:25,654 --> 00:26:27,212
Do you have
any plans tonight?

475
00:26:27,289 --> 00:26:28,779
Why?

476
00:26:28,857 --> 00:26:31,587
"Cause I would suggest
that you conduct
them inside.

477
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:33,059
Really?

478
00:26:33,128 --> 00:26:35,392
Listen, man.
l"m gonna give it
to you straight.

479
00:26:37,132 --> 00:26:39,191
Tonlght Is
a new moon.

480
00:26:39,267 --> 00:26:41,394
It"s the one night
of the month

481
00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:43,028
that they come
out to feed.

482
00:26:43,105 --> 00:26:44,595
Who?

483
00:26:44,673 --> 00:26:47,801
I could call them vampires,

484
00:26:47,876 --> 00:26:49,901
but I doubt you"d
believe that.

485
00:26:49,978 --> 00:26:52,037
If I called
them zombies,

486
00:26:52,114 --> 00:26:55,208
aw, I know you
wouldn't belleve that.

487
00:26:55,283 --> 00:26:57,581
All I know is that
they were people,

488
00:26:57,652 --> 00:27:00,416
and now they
somethlng else.

489
00:27:00,489 --> 00:27:04,823
Something... unnatural.
Parasites.

490
00:27:04,893 --> 00:27:08,056
They feed on blood.
H uman... blood.

491
00:27:08,130 --> 00:27:09,256
And if they
bite you,

492
00:27:09,331 --> 00:27:10,992
you become
one of them.

493
00:27:11,066 --> 00:27:13,762
Awright, man.

494
00:27:13,835 --> 00:27:14,961
Awright.

495
00:27:15,036 --> 00:27:16,401
They"re nesting
outside of town.

496
00:27:16,471 --> 00:27:17,665
Yeah they are.

497
00:27:17,739 --> 00:27:19,297
Just stay
inside tonight.

498
00:27:27,749 --> 00:27:30,718
Y"all as tired
of this shit
as I am, man?

499
00:27:30,786 --> 00:27:32,253
No doubt, man.

500
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,117
We gonna sit
and let that brother
roll over us?

501
00:27:34,189 --> 00:27:35,713
Or we gonna do
something about it?

502
00:27:35,791 --> 00:27:38,157
Hell, yeah.
What you
got in mind?

503
00:27:44,166 --> 00:27:45,793
Oh, yeah.

504
00:27:45,867 --> 00:27:47,300
Man, what"s
this shit for?

505
00:27:47,369 --> 00:27:48,563
You know
what it is?

506
00:27:48,637 --> 00:27:49,968
Right now?

507
00:27:50,038 --> 00:27:51,801
We supposed
to do this shit
by tomorrow man.

508
00:27:51,873 --> 00:27:53,670
It ain"t no time
like the present.

509
00:27:53,742 --> 00:27:55,300
What about
whlte dude?

510
00:27:55,377 --> 00:27:56,969
Hustle said
he"s the one
in charge.

511
00:27:57,045 --> 00:28:00,173
Think H ustle give a fuck
when we come back
with that money?

512
00:28:00,248 --> 00:28:01,977
Fuck that
brother, man.

513
00:28:02,050 --> 00:28:04,245
How long we
gonna be in there?

514
00:28:04,319 --> 00:28:07,254
We in there longer
than 10 minutes, we
gonna have some trouble.

515
00:28:07,322 --> 00:28:08,846
U ncle always said
don"t get greedy.

516
00:28:08,924 --> 00:28:10,323
Greed"s what
get you caught.

517
00:28:10,392 --> 00:28:12,019
Sound advlce.

518
00:28:12,093 --> 00:28:15,654
I can"t wait to see
the expression on
that motherfucker"s face.

519
00:28:21,136 --> 00:28:22,535
Hey.

520
00:28:22,604 --> 00:28:24,401
Hey.

521
00:28:24,473 --> 00:28:27,931
We don"t see
many new faces
around here.

522
00:28:28,009 --> 00:28:29,943
I don"t see much
of anybody
around here.

523
00:28:30,011 --> 00:28:33,742
Nobody every
really comes
downtown anymore.

524
00:28:33,815 --> 00:28:34,782
l"m Jackson.

525
00:28:34,850 --> 00:28:35,714
Kate.

526
00:28:35,784 --> 00:28:37,149
N ice to meet you.

527
00:28:37,219 --> 00:28:38,686
Good to meet
you too.

528
00:28:38,753 --> 00:28:40,345
How do you
like it here
so far?

529
00:28:40,422 --> 00:28:42,049
It"s quiet.

530
00:28:42,123 --> 00:28:46,219
There"s definitely
no shortage of that
here in Maysville.

531
00:28:53,468 --> 00:28:55,493
So where you
from originally?

532
00:28:55,570 --> 00:28:56,935
M iami.

533
00:28:57,005 --> 00:28:59,838
Really?
Sounds exciting.

534
00:28:59,908 --> 00:29:01,136
I suppose so.

535
00:29:01,209 --> 00:29:03,837
That"s gotta be better
than around here.

536
00:29:03,912 --> 00:29:06,244
You don"t like it here?
lt"s nice here.

537
00:29:07,749 --> 00:29:11,412
Who knows?
Nothing wrong
with it, just...

538
00:29:11,486 --> 00:29:13,351
nothing right
with it either.

539
00:29:13,421 --> 00:29:16,322
I suppose you always
want to leave the place
where you grow up.

540
00:29:16,391 --> 00:29:18,222
Try something new.

541
00:29:18,293 --> 00:29:20,693
Yeah. That
makes sense.

542
00:29:20,762 --> 00:29:22,957
Is that what
you"re up to?

543
00:29:23,031 --> 00:29:24,692
Trying something new?

544
00:29:24,766 --> 00:29:27,166
Something like that.

545
00:29:31,339 --> 00:29:33,398
So how long
you been on
the force?

546
00:29:34,476 --> 00:29:35,875
What?

547
00:29:35,944 --> 00:29:40,142
Oalling it a force
might be a bit
of a stretch.

548
00:29:40,215 --> 00:29:43,116
l"ve been a deputy
a little over
a year now.

549
00:29:43,184 --> 00:29:44,344
That"s good.

550
00:29:44,419 --> 00:29:45,943
Actually,

551
00:29:46,021 --> 00:29:49,047
it"s... it"s
a little boring.

552
00:29:49,124 --> 00:29:50,455
I mean,
the most
we get...

553
00:29:57,899 --> 00:30:00,424
Yeah, I
suppose so.

554
00:30:00,502 --> 00:30:02,800
Probably have
a lot of that
in M iami, huh?

555
00:30:02,871 --> 00:30:04,896
A little bit.

556
00:30:04,973 --> 00:30:06,838
Looks like
we made it
just in time.

557
00:30:06,908 --> 00:30:08,000
I think
you"re right.

558
00:30:08,076 --> 00:30:09,338
Good to meet you.

559
00:30:09,411 --> 00:30:10,241
You too.

560
00:30:10,312 --> 00:30:11,210
Hope to see you.

561
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:12,371
Definitely.

562
00:30:12,447 --> 00:30:14,312

a new customer.

serve you today?

00:31:51,246 --> 00:31:52,508
I can"t do that.

599
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:53,547
Wrong answer.

600
00:31:53,615 --> 00:31:54,980
Walt, please.

601
00:31:55,050 --> 00:31:56,142

602
00:31:56,217 --> 00:31:57,411
give them whatthey want

603
00:31:57,485 --> 00:31:58,952
and let them
just get on
outta here.

604
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:02,251
Yeah, we"ll be
on our way.

605
00:32:02,323 --> 00:32:04,382
Do I need to make
a stronger argument?

606
00:32:04,459 --> 00:32:05,983
Wait, please!

607
00:32:06,061 --> 00:32:08,256
Rich!

609
00:32:11,166 --> 00:32:14,329
But I hope you know
that nothing good
will come of this.

610
00:32:14,402 --> 00:32:17,769
Really? L"m
sorry to hear
about that. Move.

611
00:32:17,839 --> 00:32:20,239
Forgive them, Lord,
for they know not
what they do.

612
00:32:20,308 --> 00:32:21,832
Man, shut up.

613
00:32:21,910 --> 00:32:24,674

The way I see it
it"s a win-win.

621
00:32:50,505 --> 00:32:52,405
It"s a win thing.

622
00:33:02,984 --> 00:33:07,421
(female volce over radlo)
Securlty alarm has been
trlpped at the bank.

625
00:33:15,997 --> 00:33:18,363
Probably, but you

Open the vault!

634
00:33:53,902 --> 00:33:55,665
What the fuck
is taking so long?

635
00:33:55,737 --> 00:33:57,568
This motherfucker
had to start over.

636
00:33:57,639 --> 00:34:00,472
Open the vault, Rlch
or I'll start
shootln' peoplel

637
00:34:00,542 --> 00:34:02,635
Jesus, please guide

00:35:11,412 --> 00:35:12,879
We"re almost

642
00:35:16,251 --> 00:35:18,048
Hey, Jackson,

643
00:35:20,288 --> 00:35:22,085
Oh shit, man!
What the fuck

644
00:35:22,156 --> 00:35:23,783
(Malcolm)
l"ll kill him

645
00:35:23,858 --> 00:35:24,688
No!

646
00:35:24,759 --> 00:35:25,453
Sit down!

647
00:35:25,526 --> 00:35:26,720
Kate!

648
00:35:26,794 --> 00:35:28,421
No reason this has
to be violent, man.

649
00:35:28,496 --> 00:35:30,464
You can get out of here
without killing anybody.

650
00:35:33,768 --> 00:35:35,531
Do you know him?

651
00:35:37,538 --> 00:35:39,233
Well, yeah,
that"s Tom.

652
00:35:39,307 --> 00:35:41,172
You got one shot
to get him outta here.

653
00:35:41,242 --> 00:35:42,937
You blow it,
both of you,
y"all dead.

654
00:35:43,011 --> 00:35:45,172
Give him
a little
extra motivation.

655
00:35:48,883 --> 00:35:50,077
This is
a bad
idea, boss.

656
00:35:50,151 --> 00:35:51,448
Who the fuck
you tellin"?

657
00:35:51,519 --> 00:35:52,781
Oome on!
Oome on!

658
00:35:55,223 --> 00:35:57,350
You dug yourself
a hole now, boy.

659
00:35:57,425 --> 00:35:58,915
Better get
a shovel, quick.

660
00:35:58,993 --> 00:36:00,426
You know
these guys?

661
00:36:00,495 --> 00:36:01,223
Well...

662
00:36:01,296 --> 00:36:02,456
Shut up.

663
00:36:18,346 --> 00:36:20,974
Hey, Tom.
How"s it going?
