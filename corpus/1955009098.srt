1
00:00:20,353 --> 00:00:22,231
I think these people
get on these cars

2
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:25,609
thinking they're gonna see...
"There's Brad Pitt.

3
00:00:25,734 --> 00:00:30,155
He's sweeping off the sidewalk
in front of his house. Hey, there, Brad."

4
00:00:31,157 --> 00:00:34,868
Hey, it's me, Conan O'Brien
from "The Tonight Show"! Hi!

5
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:43,377
I should have said,
"Formerly of 'The Tonight Show."'

6
00:00:49,008 --> 00:00:51,926
O'Brien was announced
as Leno's "Tonight Show" successor

7
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:53,512
back in 2004,

8
00:00:53,637 --> 00:00:56,057
and five years later,
his "Tonight Show" premiered.

9
00:00:56,307 --> 00:00:59,935
But the network suits wanted to keep
the still-popular Jay Leno,

10
00:01:00,101 --> 00:01:01,936
so they had an idea...

11
00:01:02,103 --> 00:01:05,858
create a new prime-time talk show
for Jay Leno at 10:00 P.M.

12
00:01:05,983 --> 00:01:09,111
That way they hold on to both
of their hosts and save money

13
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:12,031
on producing
original scripted programming.

14
00:01:12,156 --> 00:01:13,823
But the experiment failed.

15
00:01:13,948 --> 00:01:17,118
Critics panned Leno's show,
and the ratings went way down.

16
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:20,623
And Conan's "Tonight Show" ratings
were disappointing, as well.

17
00:01:20,748 --> 00:01:24,335
So, they came up with another idea...
push the whole lineup later.

18
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:27,921
So, Jay Leno's show would go on
in the "Tonight Show" slot,

19
00:01:28,046 --> 00:01:31,049
and "The Tonight Show"
would follow at 12:05 A.M.

20
00:01:31,174 --> 00:01:33,259
I didn't want to be
the first "Tonight Show" host

21
00:01:33,384 --> 00:01:35,805
to take "The Tonight Show"
into the next day,

22
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:40,518
so I said that didn't
really work for me.

23
00:01:40,725 --> 00:01:42,103
Hey, hey! Ho, ho!

24
00:01:42,228 --> 00:01:43,978
Jay Leno's show has got to go!

25
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:45,605
Hey, hey! Ho, ho!

26
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:48,692
Jay Leno's show has got to go!
Hey, hey!

27
00:01:48,901 --> 00:01:51,611
Jay is a liar!
He said he'd retire!

28
00:01:54,281 --> 00:01:56,325
Fight, fight, fight, fight!

29
00:02:14,175 --> 00:02:16,887
I am prohibited
from being on television right now,

30
00:02:17,012 --> 00:02:21,141
contractually, for the next 5, 6 months.

31
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:24,061
What if I could just go
out there and see these people

32
00:02:24,186 --> 00:02:27,772
who were so nice and supportive
and put on a show for them?

33
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:29,400
And now it's... it's this.

34
00:02:29,525 --> 00:02:35,698
It's... I don't know, 44 dates,
starting April 12th.

35
00:02:42,872 --> 00:02:46,292
I'm 46, and what do I do now?

36
00:02:46,417 --> 00:02:48,085
What else do I have to say?

37
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:50,210
And it's just trying
to figure that out right away,

38
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:53,591
and so the tour will be interesting, 'cause
I don't quite know what it's gonna be.

39
00:02:53,716 --> 00:02:56,634
I just know that I've always liked
being in front of an audience.

40
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:59,763
That's all I know, is I really like
being in front of an audience.

41
00:02:59,972 --> 00:03:01,764
You haven't stopped at all.

42
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:07,062
You started thinking about this
the day after your final "Tonight Show."

43
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:09,147
Day... the day of. Yeah.

44
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:13,651
Why do you think that is, and what
would that mean for you to stop?

45
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:16,197
I don't know
what it would be like to stop.

46
00:03:16,405 --> 00:03:19,908
What do you mean, stop?
What does that even mean?

47
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:23,704
Really, my main goal for this
is to have some fun.

48
00:03:24,163 --> 00:03:27,957
Do you think you could have fun
without an audience in front of you?

49
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:34,715
We're in E, right?
- Yeah.

50
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:43,598
I really have fun
when I'm with the... with writers

51
00:03:43,807 --> 00:03:49,103
or when I'm with musicians
and we're working things out.

52
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:50,563
Then I'm content.

53
00:03:50,813 --> 00:03:52,900
Hey!
- Hey!

54
00:03:54,235 --> 00:03:57,070
Hi, everybody.
- Hey!

55
00:03:57,195 --> 00:04:00,032
Did the eating already happen?
- It just happened.

56
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:04,662
I had an idea a couple days ago,
which was striking me as kind of funny,

57
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:07,538
which is go out and say,
"As you know, there are, whatever,

58
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:10,000
the seven stages of grief
that people go through."

59
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:12,211
It turns out there are seven stages

60
00:04:12,336 --> 00:04:15,088
that you have to go through
when you lose your television show.

61
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:17,632
The first one is denial.

62
00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:22,721
The last stage is
you get your ass to Cleveland.

63
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:24,889
Like, you make them the last stage.

64
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,810
"We're from Cleveland!"

65
00:04:31,105 --> 00:04:33,983
Now, the whole point of this tour
was let's have some fun.

66
00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:35,692
Yeah, get him. Hit him.

67
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:38,362
If there's ever been a time
in my life to just say...

68
00:04:38,487 --> 00:04:39,904
Whoo, whoo!

69
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:42,199
"To hell with it", it's now.

70
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:45,451
We're about to start a 32-city tour,
and it's coming up fast, gang.

71
00:04:45,661 --> 00:04:46,980
"Hey, Conan, how'd the fight go?"

72
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:49,290
"it went pretty good, I guess."

73
00:04:49,497 --> 00:04:52,293
And you guys are worried about me
filling an hour and a half.

74
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,752
Just have fun and feel it.

75
00:04:54,877 --> 00:04:57,005
You guys know enough about...
Yeah.

76
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,716
And we're doing this where,
you know, we're playing it like

77
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:01,843
I just, you know... I've never
had backup singers in my life.

78
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:04,178
This is my dream, and then these
two beautiful backup singers come out.

79
00:05:04,305 --> 00:05:06,389
Ladies and gentlemen,
for the first time ever, the Coquettes!

80
00:05:13,939 --> 00:05:14,981
Yeah.

81
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:16,317
¶ Polk salad ¶

82
00:05:16,524 --> 00:05:18,026
¶ Polk salad ¶

83
00:05:18,192 --> 00:05:19,403
¶ Gonna have me a mess of ¶

84
00:05:19,528 --> 00:05:21,237
¶ Yeah, yeah ¶

85
00:05:21,362 --> 00:05:22,697
¶ Polk salad ¶

86
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:24,408
¶ Yeah, yeah, yeah ¶

87
00:05:24,615 --> 00:05:25,867
¶ Gonna have me a mess of ¶

88
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:27,161
¶ Yeah, yeah ¶

89
00:05:27,286 --> 00:05:29,038
¶ Gonna have some Polk salad ¶

90
00:05:29,163 --> 00:05:30,288
¶ Yeah, yeah ¶

91
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:32,124
¶ Gonna have me a mess of ¶

92
00:05:32,249 --> 00:05:33,584
¶ Yeah, yeah ¶

93
00:05:33,709 --> 00:05:35,908
¶ Gonna have some Polk salad ¶
Come on, ladies! Like me!

94
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:37,463
¶ Da Na Na Na Na ¶

95
00:05:37,588 --> 00:05:40,548
¶ D-a-a-a ¶

96
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:46,055
You are not playing.

97
00:05:47,139 --> 00:05:48,014
What's that?

98
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:50,016
You are not playing.
- No.

99
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:52,353
It's like the Michael Jackson movie.

100
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:54,437
Let's try these two.
- I think these two.

101
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:56,105
It's...
- Let's do it.

102
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:58,817
¶ I want my own show again ¶

103
00:05:58,983 --> 00:06:02,071
¶ Oh, I really can't wait
to have my own show again ¶

104
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:07,492
¶ Oxygen Network, give me a call
if you're listening ¶

105
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:10,913
¶ I can't wait to have
my own show again ¶

106
00:06:12,081 --> 00:06:15,250
¶ I can't wait to get
my own show again ¶

107
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:16,543
Jesus Christ!

108
00:06:16,668 --> 00:06:20,297
¶ I can't wait to get
my own show again ¶

109
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:26,762
Change it in the middle.

110
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:28,721
Then it just starts to
become this bitter...

111
00:06:28,846 --> 00:06:31,350
It'd actually be funny to have it start
as "On the Road Again"

112
00:06:31,475 --> 00:06:33,314
and then morph
into "I cannot wait for this"...

113
00:06:34,435 --> 00:06:36,021
Comedy people, check this out

114
00:06:36,146 --> 00:06:37,689
and see if I need to be pulled
over and given a ticket

115
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:39,066
or if we can possibly get away with this.

116
00:06:39,191 --> 00:06:40,901
You want to sit over there,
Zack, on the floor?

117
00:06:41,026 --> 00:06:42,903
We were playing
"On the Road Again",

118
00:06:43,028 --> 00:06:44,822
which is a song, you know...
¶ On the road again ¶

119
00:06:44,947 --> 00:06:46,706
Just a fun song,
and I'd like to start it out

120
00:06:46,824 --> 00:06:48,617
as "On the Road Again",
and then we come back

121
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:50,451
and I go
¶ My own show again ¶

122
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:52,663
¶ I can't wait to have
my own show again ¶

123
00:06:52,788 --> 00:06:57,625
Give me a second.
Something with "at 10:00", like, the time.

124
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:58,793
Yeah.

125
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:01,547
¶ I'd even take a primetime show
that's on at 10:00 ¶

126
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:06,300
¶ I just want to be on the... ¶

127
00:07:06,427 --> 00:07:08,803
There's fuel there because...

128
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:14,268
I am angry.
I'm really angry at times.

129
00:07:14,393 --> 00:07:19,355
I'm trying not to be,
but I'm really, really angry about...

130
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,233
and I just have to be honest...

131
00:07:21,358 --> 00:07:25,362
I'm very angry about the way
that I was treated,

132
00:07:25,487 --> 00:07:26,863
and I'm a person who's...

133
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:29,783
I'm the least entitled person
you'll meet in the world.

134
00:07:29,908 --> 00:07:32,326
I don't think I was entitled
to "The Tonight Show."

135
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:35,038
I don't think I'm entitled
to success in show business,

136
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:36,415
but I'm just...

137
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:38,875
sometimes I'm so mad,
I can't even breathe.

138
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,045
And I do think that this show

139
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:45,632
is some sort of,
at least, positive expression,

140
00:07:45,757 --> 00:07:50,220
because all that... there's all
that steam energy of being angry,

141
00:07:50,345 --> 00:07:54,682
and so it comes out
a little bit in performance.

142
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:56,976
You can get out there
and talk to people

143
00:07:57,101 --> 00:08:00,396
at least about being unemployed,

144
00:08:00,521 --> 00:08:03,065
being legally prohibited
from being on television,

145
00:08:03,192 --> 00:08:05,360
which is gonna be something
I talk about.

146
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:08,029
You can have the...
I can play the executives.

147
00:08:08,197 --> 00:08:11,492
And while that's not
any one particular person,

148
00:08:11,617 --> 00:08:13,785
it definitely is me saying

149
00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:17,706
to the whole idea
of non-creative people

150
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:20,542
screwing over people
that feed their bone marrow

151
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:24,004
into the wood chipper of television,

152
00:08:24,213 --> 00:08:26,798
"Fuck you", you know.
That's part of it.

153
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:28,341
I don't know what this was.

154
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:30,093
Jeff just told me to sign...
to have you sign this.

155
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:31,512
Okay. He didn't say where or anything?

156
00:08:31,637 --> 00:08:32,678
Did you want to...
No, I think...

157
00:08:32,803 --> 00:08:34,431
No, no, I don't need to read it.

158
00:08:34,556 --> 00:08:37,768
God knows I stopped reading things
I signed a long time ago.

159
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:43,105
Are there any, of all
the TV executives, like this at NBC?

160
00:08:43,315 --> 00:08:45,692
I don't know. I haven't
thought about them in a while.

161
00:08:45,817 --> 00:08:49,028
There are some
follicly challenged executives, I'm sure.

162
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:52,783
But... but, really,
this represents no one person.

163
00:08:52,908 --> 00:08:54,451
It represents two people.

164
00:08:57,995 --> 00:09:00,331
Or make it three.

165
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:06,964
Um, hey, Sweeney,
should we talk about how much

166
00:09:07,089 --> 00:09:08,756
I want to look or not look like...

167
00:09:08,966 --> 00:09:11,842
Hello, there!
I'm a generic network executive.

168
00:09:11,969 --> 00:09:15,764
My name is...

169
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:18,683
I thought I'd stop in tonight

170
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:21,769
and check out
your pathetic little show

171
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:24,273
in your pathetic little city.

172
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:27,234
Is someone walking
in and out of the door?

173
00:09:27,359 --> 00:09:30,111
Please, someone.
We need someone to guard the door.

174
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,615
Gonna announce this thing,
and then it's just time

175
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:37,995
for the nausea and the self-doubt
and the fear to take over.

176
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,370
That's the fun part.

177
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:41,956
All right, I'm gonna... where am I
gonna be doing this from?

178
00:09:42,164 --> 00:09:43,584
You're gonna have to set it up
for me to submit.

179
00:09:43,709 --> 00:09:44,543
Wherever you want.

180
00:09:44,668 --> 00:09:46,419
Well, we're gonna do it
from your microcomputer.

181
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:48,297
It was made in Micronesia.

182
00:09:48,422 --> 00:09:49,715
Are you...
do you want to pull it up?

183
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,591
No. Do it on the...

184
00:09:50,716 --> 00:09:52,551
We're gonna do it early.
We're gonna do it right now.

185
00:09:52,676 --> 00:09:54,760
I can't believe I'm here for this.

186
00:09:54,885 --> 00:09:57,221
Hit it.
- Good luck.

187
00:09:57,389 --> 00:09:59,600
Hey, Internet, I'm headed to your town
in a half-assed comedy/music tour.

188
00:09:59,725 --> 00:10:03,102
Go to http://teamcoco.com for tix.
I repeat, it's half-assed.

189
00:10:03,312 --> 00:10:06,105
It's in God's hands now.

190
00:10:07,065 --> 00:10:09,400
What time is it? 7:20.

191
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:11,736
By 7:40, I'm out of the business.
- Sure.

192
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:14,615
The promoter in New York's telling me
the first Radio City show is sold out.

193
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:16,779
It's what?
- So, everything's starting to go, huh?

194
00:10:16,825 --> 00:10:19,201
So, when do you think we're adding
the second show in Radio City?

195
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:22,788
Both shows in Chicago and the one show
in Minneapolis are officially sold out.

196
00:10:22,998 --> 00:10:27,085
700 tickets shy of selling out
the second show at Radio City.

197
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:28,419
Holy smokes.

198
00:10:28,544 --> 00:10:29,171
Jesu...

199
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:31,380
Toronto will sell out today for sure.

200
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:32,923
Minneapolis will be done today.

201
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:36,552
The West Coast stuff is a little slower...
- Right.

202
00:10:36,677 --> 00:10:38,096
Because it's early.
- Yes.

203
00:10:38,221 --> 00:10:40,807
Uhh... It's great.

204
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:43,393
2.000 tickets already sold
on the second show in Chicago.

205
00:10:43,518 --> 00:10:45,979
The teamcoco.com site
is taking too long to load.

206
00:10:46,104 --> 00:10:48,523
Oh. Well, it's getting crushed, I'm sure.

207
00:10:48,649 --> 00:10:49,106
Yeah.

208
00:10:49,316 --> 00:10:52,402
Cynthia just got the tweet.
She can't get onto the site.

209
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:55,113
"The site right now is jammed with traffic.
You can't get on, go to Ticketmaster."

210
00:10:55,238 --> 00:10:56,530
Let's write that up and send it out.

211
00:10:56,657 --> 00:10:58,950
I think it's jammed with traffic... yes.

212
00:10:59,076 --> 00:11:00,534
You're all dressed!

213
00:11:02,037 --> 00:11:05,081
Nothing motivates you
to figure out what your show is

214
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:08,626
like selling a whole bunch
of tickets... to it.

215
00:11:09,503 --> 00:11:12,214
After the band's done
their first two songs,

216
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:15,174
they stop playing, the place gets quiet,

217
00:11:15,384 --> 00:11:19,763
all the lights go out, and we go.

218
00:11:19,888 --> 00:11:23,057
¶ You see, my daddy
was lazy and no-count ¶

219
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:26,144
¶ He claimed he had a bad back ¶

220
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:29,313
¶ And all my brothers was good for ¶

221
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:32,067
¶ Watermelons out of my tool sack ¶

222
00:11:32,234 --> 00:11:34,653
We got... we're close.

223
00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:39,783
I love staring into this black void
and getting no response.

224
00:11:39,908 --> 00:11:41,158
What are you doing there?

225
00:11:41,283 --> 00:11:44,788
A Brookstone catalog going on?
What are you doing? I'll buy it for you.

226
00:11:44,913 --> 00:11:46,081
Let's come on.

227
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:47,540
You guys okay with the audio?

228
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:50,505
I'm not getting any response from anybody.
It's just looking into a pit.

229
00:11:50,585 --> 00:11:53,129
All right.
Well, enjoy your death star.

230
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:55,465
I'm trying... you had
a problem with the audio,

231
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:57,884
and I'm trying to determine
if that's been set.

232
00:11:58,009 --> 00:12:00,721
It's just a question of the mix
when you're playing...

233
00:12:00,846 --> 00:12:04,682
I just wanted to see you stand up.
I appreciate it. Let's go.

234
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:08,019
I had this idea that I've talked about,

235
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:13,107
which is to wear... wear a suit
that's an exact replica

236
00:12:13,357 --> 00:12:15,317
of the one that Eddie Murphy wore
in "Raw."

237
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:17,696
Bend over.
Touch your knees, please.

238
00:12:17,821 --> 00:12:20,030
Monday, I think
I'm getting fitted for it.

239
00:12:20,157 --> 00:12:21,700
Daddy, you look silly.

240
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:29,039
Fuck, yeah.

241
00:12:30,417 --> 00:12:32,586
Oh, my God.

242
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:37,340
I don't even think
I can sit down in this outfit.

243
00:12:37,466 --> 00:12:41,010
Well, it would be interesting to see you
try and sit in a bean bag chair.

244
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:45,682
Oh.

245
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:51,270
Is that a butter sauce?

246
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,731
Can you see
if you can find Sona?

247
00:12:53,899 --> 00:12:57,818
Look at that fish.
I think that's butter sauce.

248
00:12:58,153 --> 00:12:59,696
What'd it say
when you ordered it?

249
00:12:59,821 --> 00:13:01,701
I just need just a simple piece
of grilled fish.

250
00:13:01,782 --> 00:13:03,533
Sorry to have
to let you go over this.

251
00:13:03,658 --> 00:13:05,994
Oh. I think the restaurant
just messed up, 'cause...

252
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:08,496
Either way, you're losing
your job over this.

253
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:12,625
I really do not want to lose my job.

254
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:15,294
That's what people
who lose their job say.

255
00:13:15,419 --> 00:13:17,004
Who says,
"I'm glad I'm losing my job"?

256
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:18,298
I think I could be good.
- Yes?

257
00:13:18,423 --> 00:13:20,801
We have another one coming.
I just sent the other runner.

258
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:22,427
Did you get me a new assistant?
- I'm trying to keep my job.

259
00:13:22,552 --> 00:13:23,427
Do you mean
a new assistant coming?

260
00:13:23,595 --> 00:13:24,721
That's cool.
I'm just trying to keep my job.

261
00:13:24,846 --> 00:13:26,556
It's fine. This happens often.

262
00:13:26,681 --> 00:13:29,683
With ordering food out on tour,
you have to check everything.

263
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:31,561
We can't... It's just...

264
00:13:31,686 --> 00:13:32,729
Oh, so Sona should check things?

265
00:13:32,854 --> 00:13:33,980
Oh.
- No, no, no. Like...

266
00:13:34,105 --> 00:13:35,273
Gus, I can't believe you would...

267
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:38,400
No, I'm not throwing her under the bus.
- Gus, you're missing the point.

268
00:13:38,527 --> 00:13:41,111
I want you to throw Sona
under the bus.

269
00:13:41,238 --> 00:13:42,780
It gives me joy.

270
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:45,575
Tony can tell you what happened,
but it's gonna be fine.

271
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,952
Over half the time, I do it right.
- Yeah.

272
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:49,745
That's great.

273
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:52,915
If you were an airplane pilot,
there'd be a lot of dead people out there.

274
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,459
And I'm trying to keep it lean,

275
00:13:54,584 --> 00:13:58,254
and she keeps going out
and getting me fish that lived in butter.

276
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:00,048
It actually lived
and grew up in butter.

277
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:01,258
But you're gonna be fine.

278
00:14:01,383 --> 00:14:02,634
I said no butter.

279
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:05,720
Usually I'm at a certain weight
and then when I went off TV...

280
00:14:07,471 --> 00:14:09,099
There was a period there of...

281
00:14:09,224 --> 00:14:10,725
Just... no, that's okay.

282
00:14:10,892 --> 00:14:12,519
Of just, like, cheese popcorn.

283
00:14:12,644 --> 00:14:15,563
There was, like, what I call
my "fuck it" period.

284
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:18,692
"Fuck them. Fuck them.
They're crazy."

285
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:27,408
Oh, God.

286
00:14:30,495 --> 00:14:32,330
Hello? Job'?
Tell me it's a job.

287
00:14:32,455 --> 00:14:35,000
I'm still... we're making it up.

288
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:37,043
First you got to sell tickets.

289
00:14:37,168 --> 00:14:39,169
We did that.
That's the hard part.

290
00:14:39,296 --> 00:14:41,840
Then you come up with a show.

291
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:43,799
Apple's new iPad will be declared

292
00:14:43,924 --> 00:14:46,177
the most revolutionary device
of the last 50 years

293
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:51,307
by the editors <i>of
Things</i> to Snort Cocaine Off Of magazine.

294
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:53,434
Oh, the TBS thing is at 4:00.

295
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:56,145
We find out how real that is,
if that's really happening.

296
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:58,105
Yeah, we're not going on TBS.

297
00:14:58,273 --> 00:15:00,149
When is our meeting on Oxygen, Jeff?

298
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:05,196
All I know is that Sona
hears these things

299
00:15:05,322 --> 00:15:07,448
and then moves
heaven and earth to make sure

300
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:12,328
that we cancel our rehearsals
so that you and I drag our asses to TBS.

301
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:13,830
And then it's USA.

302
00:15:13,955 --> 00:15:15,539
My scheme is for Animal Planet.

303
00:15:15,664 --> 00:15:17,167
All right, now, ladies and gentlemen,
I know you're glad

304
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:19,210
to see the masturbating bear,
but there is a problem.

305
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:22,880
The masturbating bear
is legally the property of NBC.

306
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:26,927
Ladies and gentlemen,
say good-bye to the masturbating bear

307
00:15:27,052 --> 00:15:29,261
and say hello
to a brand-new character

308
00:15:29,386 --> 00:15:31,389
that you're gonna see tonight
for the first time,

309
00:15:31,514 --> 00:15:34,725
our own self-pleasuring panda.

310
00:15:36,937 --> 00:15:38,062
Guys, guys, there's a problem here.

311
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:41,149
When I say, "the self-pleasuring panda",
he never seems to know to go,

312
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:43,400
and then you guys keep playing,
so nothing happens.

313
00:15:43,525 --> 00:15:46,153
Can the actor who's playing... who is it?
- Blake.

314
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:48,990
Blake, can you not hear me
when I say, "the self-pleasuring panda"?

315
00:15:49,115 --> 00:15:51,576
What's that?
- Oh, fuck you.

316
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:53,370
Kiss LaBamba.

317
00:15:53,577 --> 00:15:56,538
And then we cut to LaBamba.
Hold it. Hold it. That's important.

318
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:59,000
If we don't have the cut to Loco
Richie there, then we got nothing.

319
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:02,504
It's got to be LaBamba. Bang.

320
00:16:02,921 --> 00:16:04,339
This thing's a train wreck.

321
00:16:05,966 --> 00:16:08,677
Oh, I just rubbed this microphone
into my leaking eye.

322
00:16:08,802 --> 00:16:12,389
Sorry. Seriously,
no one touch this microphone.

323
00:16:12,514 --> 00:16:14,640
There's eye discharge on the mike.

324
00:16:15,557 --> 00:16:18,394
Yeah, that's the problem.
Left and right, chopaholics.

325
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:19,520
I want these fucking people...

326
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:21,480
It's like bang, bang,
bang, bang, bang.

327
00:16:21,605 --> 00:16:22,899
And I was trying
to make it happen today,

328
00:16:23,024 --> 00:16:24,624
and you thought,
"Oh, he's insulting me."

329
00:16:24,859 --> 00:16:26,778
I know that.
- Check it out, guys.

330
00:16:26,903 --> 00:16:29,947
Hello? Hello?
Banana Company.

331
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:33,909
Fuck.
Fuck. That's what he did.

332
00:16:34,034 --> 00:16:36,996
No, there's no support here.

333
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:39,206
I went out on a limb
with Banana Company.

334
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:40,792
Hey, telephone call for you.
Pick it up.

335
00:16:40,917 --> 00:16:43,461
Hello? Banana Company.
- Yes!

336
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:45,004
I like using human puppets.

337
00:16:45,212 --> 00:16:46,880
Can I ask a question about...

338
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:48,508
That was just to look
at all of 'em.

339
00:16:48,633 --> 00:16:50,051
Yeah, we're not sure
if we're gonna do them all.

340
00:16:50,176 --> 00:16:52,095
And from now on... and I'm not
even kidding about this...

341
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:54,471
when you want to speak, you have to talk
into the banana telephone.

342
00:16:54,596 --> 00:16:56,140
I'm not gonna talk into the banana.
- You have to.

343
00:16:56,349 --> 00:16:59,977
Guys, Sona's on. Sona's got something
to say. What is it, Sona?

344
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:03,148
This is really demeaning.
- Yes. Yes. I don't know why...

345
00:17:03,313 --> 00:17:04,941
You're asking me
to talk into a banana.

346
00:17:05,066 --> 00:17:07,527
I just did it seven times,
and you're too good to do it?

347
00:17:07,652 --> 00:17:11,155
This is not a good work environment. What's
happening right now is not healthy for me.

348
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:13,782
We lost two songs,
"Seduce You" and "Creep."

349
00:17:14,034 --> 00:17:15,076
Matt, what do you got?

350
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:17,320
Oh, yeah. Matt, make a suggestion
in the banana phone.

351
00:17:17,412 --> 00:17:19,748
Does everyone like
"On the Road Again"?

352
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,961
I was just throwing it out there.

353
00:17:25,086 --> 00:17:26,766
You know.
- Well, guess what I'm doing...

354
00:17:26,796 --> 00:17:28,006
Throwing it back.
- Okay.

355
00:17:28,131 --> 00:17:29,590
Okay? You're a guy
that works in the Louvre,

356
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:31,915
You saw the Mona Lisa,
and you tossed it out the window.

357
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:35,387
Luckily, I came by, saw it,
and brought it back, okay?

358
00:17:35,512 --> 00:17:37,265
And you're like, "Well, I was
just throwing it out there."

359
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:42,854
You threw the Mona Lisa
out of the Louvre, you idiot.

360
00:17:42,979 --> 00:17:45,606
You think doing
"On the Road Again" is the Mona Lisa?

361
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:48,067
And this is the Louvre?
- Yes.

362
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:50,444
All right.
- Yes. I like that.

363
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:53,530
And I'm sick of people saying
that I'm drunk with power,

364
00:17:53,655 --> 00:17:55,032
that I've lost my perspective.

365
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:56,157
Who says that?

366
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:57,442
Can I talk?
- Yes.

367
00:17:57,535 --> 00:17:58,702
Ohh!

368
00:17:58,827 --> 00:18:00,413
Now she comes over.

369
00:18:00,622 --> 00:18:01,701
You had asked me earlier...

370
00:18:01,748 --> 00:18:02,874
I can't hear you.

371
00:18:02,999 --> 00:18:05,125
You asked me earlier...
- Hold it.

372
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,877
Just hold it.
- Can't concentrate.

373
00:18:07,002 --> 00:18:09,963
So, we lost about 16 minutes
with all that stuff,

374
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:11,965
so it's about a minute, 13 now.

375
00:18:12,133 --> 00:18:13,134
I mean an hour, 13.

376
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:15,886
You said a minute, 13,
and you said it into a banana.

377
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:20,224
I am extremely hard on myself.

378
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:22,393
Sometimes that spills
onto other people,

379
00:18:22,519 --> 00:18:24,394
you know, because
I'm that hard on myself,

380
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,080
and then when things
aren't quite right,

381
00:18:26,146 --> 00:18:29,025
I'm making these jokes
that have an edge to them

382
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:31,903
that are, like,
to Mike Sweeney, the head writer,

383
00:18:32,028 --> 00:18:35,949
to Jeff Ross, like, "Oh, really?
So, that's the best we could do?"

384
00:18:36,074 --> 00:18:39,201
Or this.
And they're little jabs.

385
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:42,955
And they're jokes with
quotation marks around them...

386
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,249
Just stretching out.

387
00:18:44,374 --> 00:18:46,750
But it's me trying to keep... I'm trying
to keep everything in the stew pot.

388
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:51,463
I'm trying to just keep it all, you
know, there and not have it spill out.

389
00:18:53,258 --> 00:18:54,968
Um, want to... want to oil that?

390
00:18:55,093 --> 00:18:57,052
Um... See? That's an example.

391
00:18:57,177 --> 00:19:00,097
That's me letting my wife know
I find that irritating.

392
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:01,974
But it's all fun and joking.

393
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:05,019
And she's gonna leave me,
and it's a 50/50 state, California.

394
00:19:07,564 --> 00:19:09,190
How does the crowd look?
Who are they?

395
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:11,526
What will we learn?
What will we learn?

396
00:19:11,733 --> 00:19:14,487
You'll learn
what comedy bits work.

397
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:15,529
Not necessarily.

398
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:16,780
That's actually true. Sorry.

399
00:19:16,905 --> 00:19:18,746
'Cause you're doing
a lot of Eugene references.

400
00:19:18,825 --> 00:19:21,035
You learn what former
"Tonight Show" staffers like.

401
00:19:21,161 --> 00:19:23,288
What's your prediction?
Will they like what we're serving up?

402
00:19:23,413 --> 00:19:26,374
Yes. I think so.
Why wouldn't they?

403
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,835
I don't know.

404
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:32,505
Thank you very much!
Everybody, please sit down!

405
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:36,217
Thank you for being here,
people that used to work for me.

406
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:39,179
That was great
coming out here right now,

407
00:19:39,304 --> 00:19:40,762
'cause I'm gonna be
really honest with you.

408
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:43,974
I'm like Tinker Bell.
Without applause, I die.

409
00:19:44,142 --> 00:19:45,977
¶ Polk Salad Annie ¶

410
00:19:46,102 --> 00:19:47,102
¶ Annie ¶

411
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:48,438
¶ Gators got your granny ¶

412
00:19:48,563 --> 00:19:50,105
¶ Gators got your granny ¶

413
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:51,857
Not having any of it.

414
00:19:51,982 --> 00:19:54,067
Not having any of it.

415
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:56,820
I wanted to thank everybody
for being here tonight.

416
00:19:56,945 --> 00:19:58,823
We're trying out a lot of stuff.

417
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:01,784
We know that I'm trying out...
throwing a million things at you,

418
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:03,452
and we appreciate people
coming all the way here

419
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:05,018
and being an audience
for us tonight.

420
00:20:05,121 --> 00:20:06,560
So, thank you so much
for doing that.

421
00:20:06,663 --> 00:20:07,957
I appreciate it
from the bottom of my heart.

422
00:20:08,082 --> 00:20:10,460
Okay, everybody,
thank you very much!

423
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:22,763
How are you?
- I was talking to Eddie Haskell.

424
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:24,432
Oh... oh.
- Yes.

425
00:20:24,557 --> 00:20:27,268
So, we got fixes and things to do,
but what'd you think?

426
00:20:27,393 --> 00:20:31,189
It felt like... I think the energy you're
gonna encounter is not a seated energy.

427
00:20:31,314 --> 00:20:32,941
Do you know what I mean?
- Right.

428
00:20:33,066 --> 00:20:35,234
How'd it feel?

429
00:20:36,653 --> 00:20:38,695
Have you talked to the kids?

430
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,155
No. Mnh-mnh.

431
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:43,867
Are we gonna tell them that I'm gonna be
taking some trips to go do my show

432
00:20:43,992 --> 00:20:45,494
but I'm gonna call them and...

433
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:47,901
They know their old man's in vaudeville.
- That's right.

434
00:20:50,959 --> 00:20:52,000
You know what Daddy has to do?

435
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:53,836
I think I have to get ready to leave.
- Okay.

436
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:56,297
Daddy has to go and get
on the plane and go to... where?

437
00:20:56,422 --> 00:20:58,132
Do you remember where I'm going?

438
00:20:58,258 --> 00:20:59,377
Can I call you on the iChat?

439
00:20:59,467 --> 00:21:02,303
Who's gonna operate the computer iChat?
- We will operate.

440
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:09,309
In improvisational acting,

441
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:11,144
there's this great rule
that I've used in my life,

442
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,814
which is act as if.

443
00:21:12,939 --> 00:21:16,942
Act as if this is completely normal.

444
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:18,611
Call me Conan, please.

445
00:21:18,778 --> 00:21:21,864
Of course I'm supposed to be
interviewing Barack Obama

446
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:25,867
or of course I'm supposed to be
playing guitar with Bruce Springsteen.

447
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:27,912
And, of course,
there's a big part of you inside

448
00:21:28,037 --> 00:21:29,757
that's saying,
"What are you talking about?"

449
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:33,209
This doesn't feel completely real.
It doesn't feel completely real to me.

450
00:21:33,334 --> 00:21:37,505
This is just an extension of replacing
David Letterman at the age of 30.

451
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:40,048
How's that first show gonna go?
What do you think, Sona?

452
00:21:40,173 --> 00:21:41,675
I think it's gonna go really well.

453
00:21:44,554 --> 00:21:46,953
I think I saw a sign
that said Sheboygan, Wisconsin.

454
00:21:47,015 --> 00:21:49,642
Sheboygan?
I kill 'em in Sheboygan.

455
00:21:53,438 --> 00:21:55,772
Let's push this crowd back.
This is...

456
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:57,650
I need room here.

457
00:21:59,067 --> 00:22:00,862
Everyone, give me some room.

458
00:22:00,987 --> 00:22:02,613
Get these people back!

459
00:22:02,864 --> 00:22:04,198
I want everyone back!

460
00:22:04,324 --> 00:22:06,451
No! No photos!

461
00:22:06,616 --> 00:22:07,951
For security reasons,

462
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:11,204
I think we should change our hotels
at the last second.

463
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:14,250
Right. To something
twice as expensive.

464
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:16,501
Yeah. It's something I learned
from Saddam Hussein.

465
00:22:16,626 --> 00:22:17,502
Yeah.

466
00:22:17,627 --> 00:22:18,253
All right, sir.

467
00:22:18,378 --> 00:22:19,739
At what time...
- Good luck, man.

468
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:21,465
Hey, thank you very much.
- You got a raw deal, man.

469
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:23,384
We're with you.
- Thank you very much. I appreciate it.

470
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:25,553
Conan, you got the shaft, brother.

471
00:22:25,678 --> 00:22:27,721
Oh, don't worry about that.
I'm okay.

472
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:30,807
I love how we got here early
so you could go out and get recognized.

473
00:22:30,932 --> 00:22:32,518
Get the fuck out of here.
I didn't do that.

474
00:22:34,269 --> 00:22:35,730
You're speaking tomorrow, right?

475
00:22:35,855 --> 00:22:37,022
Yes, yes.
- I hope it goes well.

476
00:22:37,147 --> 00:22:40,067
It'll be more than speaking.
Why don't you just go?

477
00:22:40,276 --> 00:22:41,818
Hi!

478
00:22:41,986 --> 00:22:43,070
', guys.

479
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:44,279
Make it bigger.

480
00:22:44,404 --> 00:22:45,655
Hi, Daddy.

481
00:22:49,035 --> 00:22:53,663
Can you guys hear me?
Hello?

482
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:56,041
This thing is no good.

483
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:58,586
That's their actual reaction to you.

484
00:22:59,753 --> 00:23:02,089
Hello.
- Hi.

485
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:04,549
Daddy, you can...

486
00:23:04,674 --> 00:23:06,469
They're usually more animated.

487
00:23:08,554 --> 00:23:11,140
Did you call your folks and tell 'em
you're here all right and everything?

488
00:23:11,265 --> 00:23:13,726
Oh, hi, Mom. How you doing?

489
00:23:13,851 --> 00:23:15,728
Yeah, yeah, I'm in Eugene.

490
00:23:15,853 --> 00:23:18,980
I have my own room.
I'm at the Hilton.

491
00:23:19,106 --> 00:23:22,067
It was cool, Mom.
I was a baller.

492
00:23:22,192 --> 00:23:25,779
What?
- Private planes.

493
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:28,199
Tell your mother I don't understand
half of what you're saying.

494
00:23:28,324 --> 00:23:31,243
Oh, Conan doesn't understand
how I speak sometimes.

495
00:23:31,368 --> 00:23:32,537
Okay.

496
00:23:32,662 --> 00:23:34,122
All right, dude.

497
00:23:34,247 --> 00:23:35,455
Dude? Who calls...

498
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,666
All right, Mom. I love you.
I'll talk to you soon.

499
00:23:40,001 --> 00:23:41,503
Do you know
which way we're heading?

500
00:23:41,628 --> 00:23:42,628
No.

501
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:54,724
Should I be worried
that we're opening in a town

502
00:23:54,851 --> 00:23:56,309
where nobody lives?

503
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:58,186
I don't see anybody.

504
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:03,859
There's nobody here.

505
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:09,073
Okay-

506
00:24:09,198 --> 00:24:11,992
It's gonna be all right.
They'll show up.

507
00:24:15,246 --> 00:24:16,497
So, you need a ticket.

508
00:24:16,622 --> 00:24:18,458
Can you hold it up
a little bit for us?

509
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:21,167
I thought it was...

510
00:24:21,251 --> 00:24:23,462
Stage is this way?

511
00:24:30,344 --> 00:24:34,140
Over cheek area and forehead,
at hairline and temples.

512
00:24:34,265 --> 00:24:36,183
Do not use heavily under cheek.

513
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:39,060
Will give too much depth
of cheek gaunt.

514
00:24:39,186 --> 00:24:40,313
What does that do?

515
00:24:40,438 --> 00:24:43,648
You're... it just adds color,
gives you a natural glow.

516
00:24:43,773 --> 00:24:47,111
I wish I had a natural glow.

517
00:24:47,236 --> 00:24:48,528
It's not your fault.

518
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:53,492
How are the Andy Richter
urinal mints selling?

519
00:24:53,826 --> 00:24:54,826
His idea.

520
00:24:54,911 --> 00:24:56,287
Through the roof.
- Yeah.

521
00:24:56,412 --> 00:24:58,163
People can't wait to pee on you.

522
00:24:58,288 --> 00:25:00,415
He said everybody loves
pissing on my face.

523
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:03,502
At least get out in front
of a big, you know, crowd again.

524
00:25:03,627 --> 00:25:07,298
It's been... a while.

525
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:11,134
And... l really miss it.

526
00:25:11,301 --> 00:25:13,095
Just before the plane crashes...
- Yes.

527
00:25:13,221 --> 00:25:15,681
The pilots from Aeroflot.
- One, two, three.

528
00:25:33,074 --> 00:25:35,242
¶ Hush now, child ¶

529
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:38,412
¶ Don't you cry ¶

530
00:25:39,163 --> 00:25:41,874
¶ Your folks
might understand you ¶

531
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:44,292
¶ By and by ¶

532
00:25:45,419 --> 00:25:47,547
¶ Just move on up ¶

533
00:25:48,923 --> 00:25:51,509
¶ Towards your destination ¶

534
00:25:51,968 --> 00:25:57,306
¶ Though you may find
from time to time complications ¶

535
00:25:57,597 --> 00:26:00,768
Ladies and gentlemen,

536
00:26:00,893 --> 00:26:03,604
live in Eugene, Oregon,

537
00:26:03,729 --> 00:26:09,609
it's Conan O'Brien!

538
00:26:25,041 --> 00:26:27,711
Thank you for that.
That feels good.

539
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,631
I've been off the air for 31/2 months.
I missed applause.

540
00:26:30,756 --> 00:26:33,092
This is... I got to tell you,
it's very nice.

541
00:26:33,217 --> 00:26:34,551
There are eight stages

542
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:36,721
of mourning the loss
of your talk show.

543
00:26:36,846 --> 00:26:39,640
Stage two... blame myself.

544
00:26:40,473 --> 00:26:42,433
Folks, I didn't spend
a lot of time on that stage,

545
00:26:42,476 --> 00:26:45,270
'cause what the hell did I do?

546
00:26:45,395 --> 00:26:47,647
Yeah. So...

547
00:26:47,815 --> 00:26:50,526
No. I blew past this stage,

548
00:26:50,651 --> 00:26:52,236
and I went right to stage three...

549
00:26:52,361 --> 00:26:55,114
blame everyone else around me.

550
00:26:55,823 --> 00:26:57,365
I blamed everybody
and everything,

551
00:26:57,490 --> 00:27:00,327
and this led to stage four... anger.

552
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:03,163
I was really, really angry.

553
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:06,709
And I wasn't just angry
that <i>I</i> wasn't on television anymore.

554
00:27:06,834 --> 00:27:11,463
I was mad that I'm not on TV,
but other people still are.

555
00:27:11,588 --> 00:27:14,383
That's right. Other people
still get to be on television,

556
00:27:14,508 --> 00:27:15,843
but not Conan O'Brien.

557
00:27:15,968 --> 00:27:18,095
Now, I don't want to be petty
and name names,

558
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:20,388
but what I will do
is show you photos of them

559
00:27:20,513 --> 00:27:21,973
as I name their names.

560
00:27:23,392 --> 00:27:25,644
And then, finally,
there's that last step...

561
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:28,189
that last step
that makes all the difference,

562
00:27:28,314 --> 00:27:29,898
the step where you
win your esteem back.

563
00:27:30,023 --> 00:27:32,233
You wake up one day,
you put on your clothes,

564
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:34,903
you pull yourself together,
you grow a pair, you look in the mirror,

565
00:27:35,028 --> 00:27:37,781
and you get your ass
to Eugene, Oregon!

566
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:38,990
That's what you do!

567
00:27:40,951 --> 00:27:42,536
This is a cool opportunity for me.

568
00:27:42,662 --> 00:27:45,664
This is my opportunity
to tell you who I am,

569
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:47,583
how I grew up,
and how I came to be.

570
00:27:47,708 --> 00:27:49,460
Do you want to hear this story?
It's a pretty good story.

571
00:27:49,585 --> 00:27:51,086
You do?
Let's have some music, Jim.

572
00:27:55,883 --> 00:27:59,427
Now, I'm gonna need a little more help
with this, ladies and gentlemen.

573
00:27:59,552 --> 00:28:02,097
So, right now please welcome,
for the first time

574
00:28:02,222 --> 00:28:06,477
on this stage or any stage,

575
00:28:06,602 --> 00:28:08,520
the Coquettes!

576
00:28:09,145 --> 00:28:11,022
Oh, my God.

577
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:15,068
Yeah.

578
00:28:15,277 --> 00:28:17,696
You know, since this is a tour,

579
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:19,781
we were thinking about calling
them the Tourettes,

580
00:28:19,906 --> 00:28:21,784
but they kept shouting, "Fuck."

581
00:28:21,909 --> 00:28:24,244
It was kind of weird.

582
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:26,329
All right, I'm gonna tell you
a little something about me.

583
00:28:26,454 --> 00:28:28,624
I don't know if anyone's
ever been back East much.

584
00:28:28,749 --> 00:28:30,000
You've been back East much?

585
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:35,256
I come from a place
called Brookline, Massachusetts.

586
00:28:35,381 --> 00:28:39,384
Yeah.
It's an affluent suburb of Boston.

587
00:28:39,926 --> 00:28:42,805
It was pretty tough
growing up in Brookline,

588
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:47,101
'cause most people...
most people were upper-class.

589
00:28:47,226 --> 00:28:51,396
But we... we were
upper middle-class.

590
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:54,107
It was hell.

591
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:57,737
My mama, my poor, old mama,
my sainted mama...

592
00:28:57,944 --> 00:29:00,489
I love my mama,
but she had it tough.

593
00:29:00,614 --> 00:29:02,825
You see, my mama is a lawyer

594
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:05,411
at Ropes & Gray Law Firm
in downtown Boston.

595
00:29:05,536 --> 00:29:07,829
She specializes in tax and trusts,

596
00:29:07,954 --> 00:29:09,749
and she made partner really quickly.

597
00:29:09,874 --> 00:29:12,084
Pulls in a lot of money.
Did very well for herself.

598
00:29:13,126 --> 00:29:15,880
And my daddy...
my daddy was no good.

599
00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:17,631
My daddy is no good.

600
00:29:17,757 --> 00:29:20,134
My daddy works
at Brigham Women's Hospital.

601
00:29:20,342 --> 00:29:23,220
He's a microbiologist.
He studies infectious diseases.

602
00:29:23,345 --> 00:29:25,722
He's done a lot of work
with the World Health Organization.

603
00:29:25,847 --> 00:29:27,849
Real white trash.

604
00:29:29,477 --> 00:29:31,936
¶ Back in eastern Brookline ¶

605
00:29:32,061 --> 00:29:35,065
¶ Pretty alligators are so mean ¶

606
00:29:35,191 --> 00:29:38,067
¶ There lived a young girl
who, I swear to the world ¶

607
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:40,278
¶ Made the alligators look tame ¶

608
00:29:40,403 --> 00:29:42,405
¶ Polk Salad Annie ¶

609
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:43,531
¶ Annie ¶

610
00:29:43,656 --> 00:29:45,075
¶ Gators got your granny ¶

611
00:29:45,201 --> 00:29:46,826
¶ Gators got your granny ¶

612
00:29:47,036 --> 00:29:49,246
¶ Everybody said it was a shame ¶

613
00:29:49,371 --> 00:29:52,082
¶ That my mama was working
on a chain-gang ¶

614
00:29:52,208 --> 00:29:54,167
' I

615
00:29:56,211 --> 00:29:57,671
¶ Yeah ¶

616
00:29:57,797 --> 00:30:01,467
Well, by now a lot of you
have figured out

617
00:30:01,592 --> 00:30:04,385
that this song
is pretty much bullshit.

618
00:30:04,511 --> 00:30:06,221
¶ This song is bullshit ¶

619
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:08,182
Yeah, it's just a song

620
00:30:08,307 --> 00:30:10,683
about growing up poor
in the South that I always liked.

621
00:30:10,851 --> 00:30:15,522
And I wanted to sing it,
so kind of fudged the facts a little bit.

622
00:30:16,816 --> 00:30:19,692
Two things and only two things

623
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:22,112
will get you out of a song like this.

624
00:30:22,238 --> 00:30:23,571
That's right.

625
00:30:23,696 --> 00:30:27,867
I'm talking strobe lights
and crazy movement!

626
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:32,957
¶ Gonna have me a mess of ¶

627
00:30:33,707 --> 00:30:35,917

¶ My daddy had a good job ¶

630
00:30:41,507 --> 00:30:43,424
¶ Everybody ¶

631
00:30:44,093 --> 00:30:46,386
¶ Everybody, yeah, yeah ¶

632
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,763
¶ Gonna have Polk salad ¶

633
00:30:57,772 --> 00:30:58,772
Ha! Yeah!

634
00:31:00,233 --> 00:31:02,694
The Coquettes,
ladies and gentlemen!

635
00:31:04,613 --> 00:31:06,865
Thank you, Eugene!

636
00:31:10,536 --> 00:31:11,871
Thank you, thank you.

637
00:31:11,996 --> 00:31:13,204
That's that.

638
00:31:21,087 --> 00:31:22,839
What'd you think?

639
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:29,262
We have to do 44 more of those,

640
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:32,724
so I got to tone it down, maybe.
I don't know.

641
00:31:36,436 --> 00:31:39,397
How do you feel?
- I don't feel that euphoria.

642
00:31:39,522 --> 00:31:41,400
I don't know.
I just... I like doing it,

643
00:31:41,525 --> 00:31:44,403
and then when it's done,
you're just, like...

644
00:31:45,613 --> 00:31:47,780
Everyone's just focused
on what could be better,

645
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:49,325
what could be fixed,
which is good.

646
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:50,659
That's how you get it
to be better.

647
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:54,121
But it's like... so, it's not like,
"Yeah! Let's all high-five each other."

648
00:31:54,246 --> 00:31:56,205
It's really good
to have one done, though.

649
00:31:56,332 --> 00:31:57,790
I have to say that.

650
00:31:57,916 --> 00:32:01,086
I just don't know
how we're gonna do more of them.

651
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:05,048
It looks all right.
Great job, Bill.

652
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:06,674
Good to see you.
How are you?

653
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:08,676
Hey.
Hey. How are you?

654
00:32:08,801 --> 00:32:10,721
Hey. How are you?
Good to see you.

655
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:12,722
Here's the thing that really got me.

656
00:32:12,847 --> 00:32:14,182
At the end, you're going up the alley.

657
00:32:14,307 --> 00:32:15,558
Went right behind me, right?
- Right.

658
00:32:15,683 --> 00:32:16,769
You came back down,
you kissed a girl.

659
00:32:16,894 --> 00:32:18,311
You came down, you kissed a guy.

660
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:19,646
Right. Of course.
- The row behind me.

661
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:21,815
The guy says.
"Now I can die happy."

662
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,068
You really looked happy, man.

663
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:27,278
Oh, I was thrilled... yeah, just thrilled.

664
00:32:27,403 --> 00:32:28,739
You got to pack it up and go.

665
00:32:28,864 --> 00:32:30,907
You're going to Vancouver tomorrow?

666
00:32:31,032 --> 00:32:32,826
You got another show tomorrow?

667
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:34,994
Yay!

668
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:36,413
How you doing?

669
00:32:39,333 --> 00:32:40,500
Good night, everybody!

670
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:51,929
Are you going to check in
and see what the press is saying,

671
00:32:52,054 --> 00:32:53,555
or are you going to avoid it?

672
00:32:53,681 --> 00:32:55,140
What's your plan?
- I don't read that stuff.

673
00:32:55,265 --> 00:32:56,349
He's never read it.

674
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:58,434
No. I'm fine, thanks.
I've never read it.

675
00:32:58,559 --> 00:32:59,979
He's never read it.

676
00:33:00,144 --> 00:33:02,605
It's pointless to do that.

677
00:33:03,481 --> 00:33:06,067
Because it's...
at the end of the day, it's all opinions.

678
00:33:06,192 --> 00:33:08,487
The online buzz...
- Yeah.

679
00:33:08,612 --> 00:33:10,154
That's all I like to hear.

680
00:33:10,279 --> 00:33:12,907
And I'm like, "Good. Let's move on."

681
00:33:13,075 --> 00:33:15,952
We got to keep moving
and evolving this show.

682
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:17,788
I like this part, you know?

683
00:33:17,954 --> 00:33:21,541
I like the travel aspect of it.
I like the adventure of it.

684
00:33:21,959 --> 00:33:24,044
I love walking around a city
for the first time.

685
00:33:25,378 --> 00:33:26,838
You know, when aliens come...

686
00:33:26,963 --> 00:33:28,715
When aliens come,
they're gonna land there,

687
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:31,551
'cause they're gonna think
that's where our leader lives.

688
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:33,679
Come on now.

689
00:33:33,804 --> 00:33:35,221
What am I always
hitting people for?

690
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:37,641
It's not acceptable.
It's not acceptable.

691
00:33:39,018 --> 00:33:41,603
I like that. One in two shows
by popular demand.

692
00:33:41,729 --> 00:33:43,646
How do we get back to that
where we came from?

693
00:33:43,896 --> 00:33:46,537
I know a lot of people came to Vegas
this weekend to see the fight,

694
00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:48,109
but I think this is
the main event tonight.

695
00:33:48,234 --> 00:33:50,778
Audience... Bleh! Bloviate.

696
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:53,656
I could do the scene for you.
I can do that.

697
00:33:53,781 --> 00:33:55,867
What's that?
Did you talk over me again?

698
00:33:56,117 --> 00:33:57,827
Get your radar straight.

699
00:33:57,952 --> 00:33:59,663
Seriously, man.

700
00:33:59,788 --> 00:34:01,539
When Mozart's playing the old 88s,

701
00:34:01,664 --> 00:34:04,917
you don't sit on his lap
and play "Chopsticks."

702
00:34:05,044 --> 00:34:07,628
Ooh, wow.
- I might be a fucking genius,

703
00:34:07,755 --> 00:34:09,380
and I might be
the biggest dick ever.

704
00:34:09,505 --> 00:34:11,007
I don't know.
Or maybe both.

705
00:34:11,132 --> 00:34:12,467
That's what Patton was.

706
00:34:12,592 --> 00:34:14,469
Napoleon.
- Maybe.

707
00:34:14,594 --> 00:34:15,971
Clemenceau.
- Pulitzer.

708
00:34:16,096 --> 00:34:18,056
About 15-ish.

709
00:34:22,101 --> 00:34:23,978
Hello, Las Vegas.
How's everybody doing?

710
00:34:24,103 --> 00:34:26,190
You ready?
What else is forbidden?

711
00:34:26,315 --> 00:34:27,440
I'll tell you what's forbidden.

712
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:30,235
This is how crazy this thing got
between me and NBC.

713
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:34,197
It got so crazy,
anyone who even looks like me

714
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:36,449
can't be on television right now.

715
00:34:36,574 --> 00:34:37,784
Yes. It's true.

716
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:39,429
Yeah. Say good-bye
to the Wendy's girl.

717
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:41,871
She can't exist right now.

718
00:34:42,081 --> 00:34:43,498
Say good-bye
to Jimmy Neutron.

719
00:34:43,623 --> 00:34:45,083
Jimmy Neutron's gone.

720
00:34:45,208 --> 00:34:47,085
And, of course, say farewell
to Oscar-winning actress

721
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:48,336
Tilda Swinton.

722
00:34:48,461 --> 00:34:50,130
She's just out of here.

723
00:34:55,802 --> 00:34:57,679
Are you looking
for a good time?

724
00:34:57,804 --> 00:35:00,264
I mean a really good time?

725
00:35:00,556 --> 00:35:02,518
The kind of good time
where you wake up

726
00:35:02,643 --> 00:35:04,018
with body glitter in your mouth

727
00:35:04,143 --> 00:35:07,063
and the smell of grandma
on your clothes?

728
00:35:07,481 --> 00:35:09,900
Then look no further than

729
00:35:10,025 --> 00:35:13,112
Las Vegas' oldest topless bar.

730
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:17,865
Located north of the Strip,
opened in '72,

731
00:35:18,074 --> 00:35:21,744
which is also the average age
of their dancers.

732
00:35:21,869 --> 00:35:24,164
These fossilized beauties
give new meaning

733
00:35:24,289 --> 00:35:26,958
to the term "flappers."

734

Vegas.
- Vegas.

758
00:37:07,226 --> 00:37:09,478
Are people
happy with that show?

759
00:37:09,603 --> 00:37:11,480
Nobody was unhappy.

760
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:17,777
You know something?

761
00:37:17,985 --> 00:37:20,447
That night when you were talking
about how angry you sometimes feel

762
00:37:20,572 --> 00:37:22,282
and how you're kind of
working that out in the show

763
00:37:22,407 --> 00:37:23,659
and a lot of, you know...

764
00:37:23,867 --> 00:37:24,701
Right.

765
00:37:24,826 --> 00:37:27,329
Well, now that you've been doing it,
has that changed at all?

766
00:37:27,536 --> 00:37:30,248
It feels really good to go out
and perform in front of people...

767
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:39,423
and be in contact with people that are
enthusiastic about me and what I do,

768
00:37:39,632 --> 00:37:43,135
and so that's obviously
healthy or feels good.

769
00:37:43,302 --> 00:37:46,139
And then there are other times
where I'll just...

770
00:37:46,306 --> 00:37:50,101
be back at the hotel, and I'll be thinking
about what went down

771
00:37:50,226 --> 00:37:53,730
with those, you know, people at NBC,

772
00:37:53,855 --> 00:37:58,360
and I'll be really mad
about it all over again.

773
00:37:58,568 --> 00:38:00,195
So, yeah, I think it's... that'll...

774
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,364
It's gonna take a little while.

775
00:38:02,489 --> 00:38:03,824
It's like a gallstone.

776
00:38:03,949 --> 00:38:07,411
It just has to work its way
through my urethra.

777
00:38:07,661 --> 00:38:12,164
And eventually that stone
and a little bit of blood

778
00:38:12,291 --> 00:38:16,503
will drop into the toilet, and...

779
00:38:16,628 --> 00:38:18,338
I'll be done with those fuckers.

780
00:38:18,505 --> 00:38:21,340
Have you seen
the new In Touch magazine?

781
00:38:22,092 --> 00:38:25,094
It's time to really kick things
up a notch now.

782
00:38:25,304 --> 00:38:29,141
Please welcome our friend
Mr. Eddie Vedder.

783
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:44,697
¶ Out here in the fields ¶

784
00:38:44,822 --> 00:38:47,826
¶ I fight for my meals ¶

785
00:38:49,286 --> 00:38:55,291
¶ I get my back into my living ¶

786
00:38:57,668 --> 00:39:00,672
¶ Well, I don't need to fight ¶

787
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:05,344
¶ To prove I'm right ¶

788
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:10,431
¶ I don't need to be forgiven ¶

789
00:39:10,556 --> 00:39:13,809
¶ No, no, no, no, no, no ¶

790
00:39:37,291 --> 00:39:39,628
Oh, my God!

791
00:39:44,465 --> 00:39:46,635
What the hell was that?!

792
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:51,639
I will never let Eddie Vedder
borrow my tambourines again.

793
00:39:55,101 --> 00:39:56,478
Jesus.

794
00:39:56,603 --> 00:39:57,603
This is a big show.

795
00:39:57,686 --> 00:39:59,481
It's a big show, yeah.

796
00:39:59,606 --> 00:40:03,818
It started out as a small idea,
and it kept getting bigger and bigger.

797
00:40:03,943 --> 00:40:05,653
Where'd you get
these musical chops?

798
00:40:05,778 --> 00:40:07,572
What's the difference
between doing it here

799
00:40:07,697 --> 00:40:09,824
and doing it in front
of a live audience in New York?

800
00:40:09,949 --> 00:40:11,409
Are you making
any money on this?

801
00:40:11,534 --> 00:40:13,161
Yeah, I hope so.

802
00:40:13,369 --> 00:40:14,913
How's your voice holding up?

803
00:40:15,038 --> 00:40:17,081
It's so far, so good.
It's not the show.

804
00:40:17,206 --> 00:40:19,418
It's the interviews right after
the show that are killing me.

805
00:40:19,543 --> 00:40:22,253
Let's get to that fake birthday party.

806
00:40:23,088 --> 00:40:25,297
Oh, what an awkward situation.

807
00:40:25,465 --> 00:40:27,925
This is the exact opposite
of what I wanted.

808
00:40:28,135 --> 00:40:29,260
This is great!

809
00:40:31,096 --> 00:40:33,056
This is amazing!

810
00:40:33,181 --> 00:40:37,768
I've always wanted to have a 47th birthday
with "60 Minutes" here,

811
00:40:37,978 --> 00:40:41,815
and this is such an intimate way
to celebrate my birth.

812
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:43,650
How are you?

813
00:40:43,817 --> 00:40:45,110
Good to see you, pal.

814
00:40:45,318 --> 00:40:48,487
This'll be good TV, see.
We'll get B-roll of the old birthday.

815
00:40:55,996 --> 00:40:57,664
Yes, it's really good!

816
00:41:02,668 --> 00:41:06,213
¶ Happy birthday to you ¶

817
00:41:06,338 --> 00:41:11,635
¶ Happy birthday, dear Conan ¶

818
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:16,516
¶ Happy birthday to you ¶

819
00:41:18,934 --> 00:41:21,021
¶ Happy birthday ¶

820
00:41:21,146 --> 00:41:22,481
Now shut up.

821
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:24,231
Like, I ran into someone
on the street, and he said,

822
00:41:24,356 --> 00:41:26,108
"Yeah, a friend of mine said
he asked you for an autograph,

823
00:41:26,233 --> 00:41:27,393
and you, like, blew him off",

824
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:30,905
and I said, "That's not possible."

825
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:33,407
I said it with authority,
like the way you would say,

826
00:41:33,532 --> 00:41:36,244
"A friend of mine said you shot at him
with your .22 handgun."

827
00:41:36,369 --> 00:41:38,121
"That's not possible."

828
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:41,208
It's Conan O'Brien's birthday.

829
00:41:43,918 --> 00:41:45,961
I can't leave the venue right now.

830
00:41:46,086 --> 00:41:49,166
Can you explain... will you go outside
and get that from him and I'll sign it?

831
00:41:49,257 --> 00:41:52,635
I have no authority here.
Thank you, one guy.

832
00:41:53,385 --> 00:41:54,721
You're done in this business.

833
00:41:54,846 --> 00:41:57,431
He asked if you could use
the red pen on that one.

834
00:41:57,556 --> 00:41:59,099
Oh. A controlling dick.

835
00:41:59,643 --> 00:42:02,853
I've never denied anybody anything.

836
00:42:03,063 --> 00:42:04,396
Okay, and you want me
to sign your back?

837
00:42:04,523 --> 00:42:06,315
Yes.
- Okay. Why?

838
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:10,570
So I can get it tattooed. It's my first
one, so it's gonna be really special.

839
00:42:12,447 --> 00:42:14,907
Dah! Paparazzi!

840
00:42:16,034 --> 00:42:18,994
That's why, you know, it's important...
like, you're really nice.

841
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:23,625
Sona's really nice to people on the phone
and sort of warm and personal,

842
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:25,835
and I think a lot of people
can't get to me.

843
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:30,297
That's important if the person
who's my voice to the outside world

844
00:42:30,422 --> 00:42:34,427
is telling people to...
like, being cold.

845
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:36,096
I just think that's huge.

846
00:42:36,221 --> 00:42:37,931
It's a compliment?
- I complimented you.

847
00:42:38,056 --> 00:42:39,266
Thank you.

848
00:42:42,893 --> 00:42:44,436
How long
did you drive to be here?

849
00:42:44,563 --> 00:42:48,275
Well, I drove seven hours to Calgary
and then like three here.

850
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:49,442
Just to come see the show?

851
00:42:49,568 --> 00:42:52,570
Yeah.
- Oh, get in here, man. Jesus. Uh.

852
00:42:52,778 --> 00:42:55,114
Now, what's your...
you had a situation here?

853
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:59,452
I had this I.D. card that I bought specifically
so I could see this, 'cause I am 18.

854
00:42:59,661 --> 00:43:01,121
So, what's the problem?

855
00:43:01,329 --> 00:43:04,528
I wrote my learner's and passed it two
days ago, and they took my I.D. card away.

856
00:43:04,623 --> 00:43:07,710
I'm just wondering if they're gonna Jew me
and not let me in here.

857
00:43:07,835 --> 00:43:08,835
If they're gonna what?

858
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:13,382
They're gonna gyp me
and not let me in here.

859
00:43:13,967 --> 00:43:16,594
And that would just not be cool
after getting a ticket.

860
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:18,221
I've been really excited to see this.

861
00:43:18,346 --> 00:43:20,222
Right. Okay. Okay.
- Yeah.

862
00:43:20,347 --> 00:43:23,184
Okay, I'll just have to look
past the anti-Semitic remark.

863
00:43:24,893 --> 00:43:27,146
I love Mel Gibson, dude.

864
00:43:27,271 --> 00:43:30,483
Uh, wow. Okay, now I
don't think I want to let you in.

865
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:31,693
No, no, no, no.

866
00:43:31,818 --> 00:43:33,652
Have to promise to never use
that expression again.

867
00:43:33,777 --> 00:43:34,612
Okay, I promise.

868
00:43:34,778 --> 00:43:37,364
Jeff Ross!
Can you come here for a sec?

869
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:40,159
Now, I'm gonna tell you something.
My producer's Jewish.

870
00:43:40,284 --> 00:43:44,204
So, when you start saying... when you start
saying, "I got jewed out of something",

871
00:43:44,331 --> 00:43:47,208
and you're asking my producer,
who's Jewish, and I'm half-Jewish...

872
00:43:47,416 --> 00:43:51,045
so, this kid has a situation where
he's driven like 60 hours to get here.

873
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:54,507
And?
- And he doesn't have his government I.D.

874
00:43:54,632 --> 00:43:56,259
that will get him into the casino.

875
00:43:56,467 --> 00:43:58,148
Now these guys are saying
he can't come in.

876
00:43:58,302 --> 00:44:00,262
I don't know if there's anyone here
at the casino we can ask.

877
00:44:00,387 --> 00:44:01,139
Maybe.

878
00:44:01,347 --> 00:44:03,141
¶ Conan's vocal ¶

879
00:44:03,391 --> 00:44:05,684
¶ Don't have enough Conan's vocal ¶

880
00:44:07,519 --> 00:44:11,650
Hold on. Dave?
Testing, testing.

881
00:44:13,902 --> 00:44:15,737
Welcome to it.

882
00:44:15,862 --> 00:44:20,742
I do feel like we've been arrested at the border
and asked to wait in this room. Don't you?

883
00:44:20,992 --> 00:44:22,534
What happened to us, Andy?

884
00:44:24,788 --> 00:44:26,789
We'll get a giant poster of Jay Leno.

885
00:44:26,914 --> 00:44:28,083
No.
- Eee!

886
00:44:28,208 --> 00:44:30,501
Well, 'cause everyone
who's performed here has a poster.

887
00:44:30,626 --> 00:44:32,170
Oh. Eee!

888
00:44:32,295 --> 00:44:33,815
It actually says that
when you walk by.

889
00:44:35,923 --> 00:44:38,284
Apply it with the brush
and then tap it in with your finger.

890
00:44:38,342 --> 00:44:40,887
I will. I will. I will. Please.
- Oh. Okay.

891
00:44:41,012 --> 00:44:43,431
Covering up the eye vein...
- Oh, boy.

892
00:44:43,556 --> 00:44:45,809
That most people love,
buy you guys insist I cover.

893
00:44:46,016 --> 00:44:48,603
You are aging wonderfully, Millicent.

894
00:44:49,896 --> 00:44:52,273
I'm ready to meet my groom.

895
00:44:52,398 --> 00:44:54,108
Send him in.

896
00:44:54,317 --> 00:44:56,027
You use whichever
makes you feel prettiest.

897
00:44:56,152 --> 00:44:59,030
If it's blowing off
like that, it's too much.

898
00:44:59,155 --> 00:45:01,824
I think I know... would you get
your arm out of the mirror?

899
00:45:01,949 --> 00:45:03,827
You insane Armenian.
- Oh, my God!

900
00:45:03,952 --> 00:45:06,913
Did you see her lunge at me
with a cutlass?

901
00:45:07,038 --> 00:45:09,248
How much more deodorant
do you need?

902
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:10,458
I want more.

903
00:45:10,583 --> 00:45:11,960
Is it like one for each armpit?

904
00:45:12,085 --> 00:45:13,878
You know what I do?
I pretend they're awards.

905
00:45:14,003 --> 00:45:15,588
Out when I get naked.

906
00:45:15,713 --> 00:45:17,090
Oh, no.
- Sorry.

907
00:45:17,257 --> 00:45:20,260
Hey, I'm sorry I said that shit about you
in the Edmonton Gazette.

908
00:45:20,385 --> 00:45:22,512
Don't be sorry.
It needed to be said.

909
00:45:22,679 --> 00:45:24,179
But you're not a fucking asshole

910
00:45:24,304 --> 00:45:26,474
who's the worst piece of shit
that anyone's ever seen.

911
00:45:35,692 --> 00:45:37,652
When do I do my meet and greet?

912
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:39,195
What? Don't be nervous.

913
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:40,487
I've, like, loved you for so long.

914
00:45:40,612 --> 00:45:43,449
Oh, really? You have?
- Yes.

915
00:45:43,657 --> 00:45:44,826
All right, well...
- I love you.

916
00:45:44,951 --> 00:45:46,244
Well, thank you so much.

917
00:45:46,369 --> 00:45:49,121
No. Truly, I love you.

918
00:45:49,246 --> 00:45:51,750
She won't send you...
I'll make sure...

919
00:45:51,916 --> 00:45:54,210
It was awesome. And it was fun.
- Oh, good.

920
00:45:54,418 --> 00:45:55,670
I'm telling people
this is my prom photo.

921
00:45:55,795 --> 00:45:58,088
Hello.

922
00:45:58,213 --> 00:46:00,425
This won't go well.

923
00:46:04,471 --> 00:46:05,637
Oh, yay! Yay!

924
00:46:07,139 --> 00:46:09,266
This is weird.
I just heard about this.

925
00:46:09,391 --> 00:46:10,601
There's a WME...

926
00:46:10,726 --> 00:46:14,146
William Morris Endeavor's
throwing a party before the show.

927
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:17,817
I'll do a show for them before the show,
blow out my voice.

928
00:46:20,487 --> 00:46:22,989
My inherent neediness will dominate.

929
00:46:23,197 --> 00:46:25,449
I'm just gonna make it
my mandate not to talk.

930
00:46:25,657 --> 00:46:26,818
How are you? Good to see you.

931
00:46:26,867 --> 00:46:27,869
Hi. How are you?

932
00:46:28,077 --> 00:46:29,161
I really...
I just really love it.

933
00:46:29,369 --> 00:46:31,039
There's like a...
it sounds crass,

934
00:46:31,164 --> 00:46:34,333
but kind of like a Make-A-Wish Foundation
element to the whole thing.

935
00:46:34,458 --> 00:46:36,418
Like, Conan's got 3 months to live.

936
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:39,103
Let's not tell him, but let's let him have
this complete fantasy.

937
00:46:39,213 --> 00:46:40,574
How are you?
Very nice to meet you.

938
00:46:40,672 --> 00:46:42,217
How are you?
Good to see you.

939
00:46:42,342 --> 00:46:43,342
How are you?
Yes, I do.

940
00:46:43,425 --> 00:46:44,706
Hi. How are you?
Nice to see you.

941
00:46:44,802 --> 00:46:46,637
The chairman
of Warner Bros. Television.

942
00:46:46,762 --> 00:46:48,003
Ah, yes, very nice to meet you.

943
00:46:48,056 --> 00:46:48,764
I'm not used to...

944
00:46:48,889 --> 00:46:50,849
They told me, like, yeah,
they have a party before the show,

945
00:46:50,974 --> 00:46:52,309
and I said, "Before the show?"

946
00:46:52,434 --> 00:46:55,730
This is Nellie Andreeva, who writes...
she writes nice things about you.

947
00:46:55,855 --> 00:46:57,454
Oh, thank you so much.
- You got to go.

948
00:46:57,481 --> 00:46:59,192
What's that?
- They want you backstage.

949
00:46:59,317 --> 00:47:00,568
I know this guy. How are you?

950
00:47:00,693 --> 00:47:02,402
How are you?
Everything okay?

951
00:47:02,528 --> 00:47:05,614
Let's have a new rule
about parties before the show.

952
00:47:05,739 --> 00:47:08,117
It's just... I'm out
there, like, working it.

953
00:47:08,326 --> 00:47:09,827
I'm like, "This is fucked up."

954
00:47:09,952 --> 00:47:11,829
Well, it doesn't... okay.

955
00:47:12,038 --> 00:47:13,581
Well...

956
00:47:13,706 --> 00:47:14,833
Hey.
'Yes?

957
00:47:14,958 --> 00:47:18,210
Oh, no.
- I smell... I smell wet hay.

958
00:47:18,335 --> 00:47:19,335
There he is.

959
00:47:19,378 --> 00:47:20,713
Yay, yay-
Did you get my e-mail?

960
00:47:20,838 --> 00:47:22,005
Yee-haw.

961
00:47:22,130 --> 00:47:23,423
You don't read your e-mails?

962
00:47:23,550 --> 00:47:24,717
How are you?
Great to see you.

963
00:47:24,842 --> 00:47:27,637
So, have you...
- I e-mailed him, but he doesn't read e-mails.

964
00:47:27,762 --> 00:47:29,347
I didn't get the e-mail.
- Oh, for God's sake.

965
00:47:29,472 --> 00:47:32,016
Gee, gawrsh, what's an e-mail?

966
00:47:34,476 --> 00:47:35,728
Doing, doing, doing.

967
00:47:35,853 --> 00:47:37,355
Get him.
Get him, Jon Hamm.

968
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:40,608
Doing, doing, doing.
- We're best friends.

969
00:47:40,817 --> 00:47:41,943
No, look at this.
Check this out.

970
00:47:42,068 --> 00:47:43,443
Oh, yeah.

971
00:47:43,570 --> 00:47:45,864
That is so stupid.

972
00:47:47,574 --> 00:47:49,324
That's called the toilet, Jack.

973
00:47:50,367 --> 00:47:51,452
What a rube.

974
00:47:52,411 --> 00:47:56,039
We'll just do a little...
little tune here.

975
00:47:56,248 --> 00:47:59,043
It's a song I wrote
about Jack McBrayer.

976
00:47:59,168 --> 00:48:01,336
¶ You stupid hick ¶

977
00:48:03,172 --> 00:48:06,217
¶ You were born in shit ¶

978
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:09,137
Oh, that's not nice.
- What?

979
00:48:09,262 --> 00:48:12,472
But, anyway, there's a whole part
about a mule calling you on the phone.

980
00:48:12,599 --> 00:48:14,434
Why am I working this hard
before a show?

981
00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:15,684
I don't know.

982
00:48:15,809 --> 00:48:17,769
I'm not sure I know.

983
00:48:19,105 --> 00:48:20,606
Hey, Jon, guess who I'm doing.

984
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:24,652
: Hey, Jon,
you want to go out and try and get...

985
00:48:24,777 --> 00:48:26,362
Jim Nabors. Jim Nabors.

986
00:48:26,487 --> 00:48:28,155
No. Keep thinking.

987
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:30,949
Hey, I love Los Feliz, too.

988
00:48:31,284 --> 00:48:34,036
These will save my throat.
Do you have any cocaine?

989
00:48:34,161 --> 00:48:35,914
What is wrong with you?
- Come on.

990
00:48:36,039 --> 00:48:38,791
He's changed.
- I need it.

991
00:48:41,376 --> 00:48:43,670
I had a different Jack McBrayer
on the phone.

992
00:48:46,215 --> 00:48:48,217
Okay, he can't help...

993
00:48:50,637 --> 00:48:52,472
Stop it!

994
00:48:57,268 --> 00:48:58,894
Ha ha ha, I can't help it.

995
00:48:59,019 --> 00:49:00,563
How come you get
to hang out with him?

996
00:49:00,688 --> 00:49:02,273
There's such an inequality.

997
00:49:02,481 --> 00:49:05,485
I don't want to sound rude.
- Too late.

998
00:49:05,652 --> 00:49:07,820
But it is. It's like watching
the Monopoly money guy

999
00:49:07,945 --> 00:49:09,322
walking around with a pig on a leash.

1000
00:49:09,447 --> 00:49:11,782
It's ridiculous.
Yee-haw!

1001
00:49:11,949 --> 00:49:13,326
Come on.

1002
00:49:14,494 --> 00:49:17,704
Will you say that this is crazy
for me to be doing this before a show?

1003
00:49:18,539 --> 00:49:20,833
Well, who's in control of things
around here?

1004
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:23,920
No, you can't put this on Sona.
She's like 18.

1005
00:49:24,086 --> 00:49:26,327
So far, it's been the most fun
I've had in show business.

1006
00:49:27,507 --> 00:49:29,717
Crazy. Who has a party for...
Who does that?

1007
00:49:29,842 --> 00:49:31,469
Who entertains people
before a show?

1008
00:49:31,594 --> 00:49:32,887
I want to find someone.

1009
00:49:33,012 --> 00:49:34,639
Jeff's acting like, "I didn't do this."

1010
00:49:34,764 --> 00:49:36,891
I'm like, "Aren't you fucking in charge?"

1011
00:49:37,016 --> 00:49:39,059
I think you're in charge.
- I'm tired now.

1012
00:49:39,184 --> 00:49:41,688
Voice. Voice.

1013
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:49,112
Walk of death. Let's do it.

1014
00:49:49,237 --> 00:49:49,987
Walk?

1015
00:49:53,282 --> 00:49:54,449
Guys, follow me.

1016
00:49:54,784 --> 00:49:56,077
But I'm telling you guys something.

1017
00:49:56,202 --> 00:50:00,206
Doing this tour is a huge milestone
for me... huge milestone for me.

1018
00:50:00,331 --> 00:50:03,001
And I will tell you why.
I will tell you why.

1019
00:50:03,291 --> 00:50:06,628
This is the first time
in my 20-year television career

1020
00:50:06,753 --> 00:50:09,257
that anyone has paid to see me.

1021
00:50:09,382 --> 00:50:11,550
Isn't that amazing?

1022
00:50:11,675 --> 00:50:14,302
First time anyone's paid to see me.

1023
00:50:15,012 --> 00:50:15,554
Yeah.

1024
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:18,974
Oh, don't get me wrong.
They've paid to make me go away.

1025
00:50:29,027 --> 00:50:31,028
It was good, right?

1026
00:50:31,153 --> 00:50:32,447
Yes, it was good.

1027
00:50:35,824 --> 00:50:38,536
I think I lost 30 pounds on that one.

1028
00:50:39,369 --> 00:50:41,873
I'm what they called
in vaudeville a sweat act.

1029
00:50:42,664 --> 00:50:43,750
We're gonna have a problem.

1030
00:50:43,875 --> 00:50:46,114
What's that?
- There's always an excuse for me to talk.

1031
00:50:46,210 --> 00:50:48,628
Like, "Well, it would be good if you run this
phone call. It'd be good if you came by.

1032
00:50:48,755 --> 00:50:50,672
It'd be good if you talk to these people.
It would really help.

1033
00:50:50,797 --> 00:50:53,300
It'll just take 10 minutes. It'll
take 15 minutes." But it never does.

1034
00:50:53,509 --> 00:50:55,969
You could shoot me in the left lung
and I'll do this show,

1035
00:50:56,094 --> 00:50:58,222
but if I lose my voice, we're done.

1036
00:50:58,347 --> 00:50:59,766
Everyone's thrilled.

1037
00:50:59,891 --> 00:51:01,768
They're all outside.
- I'll go say hi.

1038
00:51:03,311 --> 00:51:05,146
That was fantastic.
That was so much fun.

1039
00:51:05,271 --> 00:51:06,606
We melted minds.

1040
00:51:06,938 --> 00:51:08,023
Thank you so much.

1041
00:51:10,610 --> 00:51:12,862
It doesn't matter if it's frickin' U2.

1042
00:51:12,987 --> 00:51:14,655
If I go to a concert,

1043
00:51:14,864 --> 00:51:18,784
I always have this intense compulsion
to go onstage, no matter who's onstage.

1044
00:51:18,909 --> 00:51:21,746
Invariably, security
gets in the way. Yeah.

1045
00:51:21,954 --> 00:51:23,581
I'm gonna tell people
that you just showed up.

1046
00:51:23,706 --> 00:51:25,458
I can't stop him.
- What the hell?

1047
00:51:26,918 --> 00:51:28,503
Thanks for having me.
Thanks.

1048
00:51:28,628 --> 00:51:29,961
Thank you for doing it.
This was amazing.

1049
00:51:30,088 --> 00:51:31,380
I'm gonna take a hot tub.

1050
00:51:31,505 --> 00:51:33,632
You go right ahead.

1051
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:35,400
That was amazing.
- I had so much fun.

1052
00:51:35,510 --> 00:51:36,677
So fun to see that.

1053
00:51:36,802 --> 00:51:38,387
Hi.
- Here we go.

1054
00:51:38,512 --> 00:51:39,972
Get the hot tub going.

1055
00:51:40,139 --> 00:51:42,391
Hey. How are you?
- Hey. Thanks so much.

1056
00:51:42,557 --> 00:51:43,934
Hey, how are you?
Good to see you.

1057
00:51:44,059 --> 00:51:45,780
Great job.
- Am I in trouble if I don't...

1058
00:51:45,811 --> 00:51:47,063
Can I go do this
and then come back?

1059
00:51:47,188 --> 00:51:48,313
Yeah, yeah, you can do this.

1060
00:51:48,438 --> 00:51:49,679
Now I go do the meet and greet.

1061
00:51:49,773 --> 00:51:51,650
Oh, do it.
- It's the part that makes it all happen.

1062
00:51:51,775 --> 00:51:52,775
It's all right.

1063
00:51:54,695 --> 00:51:56,947
Hey, how are you?
- I have a bromance with you.

1064
00:51:57,072 --> 00:51:59,242
I've always just kind of wanted
to run away and join the circus,

1065
00:51:59,367 --> 00:52:00,326
and that's what this show is.

1066
00:52:00,451 --> 00:52:01,869
One, two, and three.

1067
00:52:01,994 --> 00:52:03,788
Now, I made you
some cookies, Conan.

1068
00:52:03,913 --> 00:52:05,748
Now, I know...
and it's not poisonous.

1069
00:52:05,873 --> 00:52:08,918
On three.
One, two, and three.

1070
00:52:09,376 --> 00:52:11,670
Thank you for liking what I do.
- Whoo!

1071
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:12,797
You make us so happy.

1072
00:52:12,922 --> 00:52:14,132
At the end of the day...
Oh, that's...

1073
00:52:14,257 --> 00:52:16,300
That's, at the end of the day,
that's all I've ever wanted.

1074
00:52:16,425 --> 00:52:18,177
Are you gonna bring...
- And money and real estate.

1075
00:52:18,385 --> 00:52:21,304
Hey, guys.
- Hey, that was amazing.

1076
00:52:21,931 --> 00:52:26,518
I can't shut up, so I will talk to cab
drivers for 40 minutes when I don't have to.

1077
00:52:26,643 --> 00:52:28,521
Hey.
How do we get to each...

1078
00:52:28,646 --> 00:52:31,190
Hey. So, this is Karen Lee.

1079
00:52:31,315 --> 00:52:32,650
Hi. How are you?
Nice to meet you.

1080
00:52:32,775 --> 00:52:34,255
Nice to see you.
Oh, hey, how are you?

1081
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:35,402
Hi. Tab.
- How are you?

1082
00:52:35,527 --> 00:52:36,612
Nice to see you.
- This is Sydney.

1083
00:52:36,737 --> 00:52:37,445
Hi, Coco.

1084
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:41,992
Hi. How are you?

1085
00:52:42,117 --> 00:52:43,557
Nice to see you.
- Nice to see you.

1086
00:52:43,661 --> 00:52:44,911
This is my cousin Leonard.

1087
00:52:45,036 --> 00:52:46,246
Hey, how you doing?
- Nice to meet you.

1088
00:52:46,371 --> 00:52:47,539
Nice to see you.

1089
00:52:47,664 --> 00:52:48,916
This is my Auntie April.

1090
00:52:49,041 --> 00:52:50,668
Hi, precious.
How are you?

1091
00:52:50,793 --> 00:52:52,253
Do you see any pizza on my face?

1092
00:52:52,378 --> 00:52:53,588
No, I don't see any pizza.

1093
00:52:53,713 --> 00:52:55,672
This is my mama.
- Hi. How are you?

1094
00:52:55,797 --> 00:52:57,967
How are you?
- Good. Good. Good.

1095
00:52:58,092 --> 00:53:00,719
You have such a talented,
amazing daughter.

1096
00:53:00,844 --> 00:53:02,804
Mom, Mom, get on the other side.

1097
00:53:02,929 --> 00:53:04,599
Treat the man right.

1098
00:53:04,806 --> 00:53:06,184
Get my good side now.

1099
00:53:07,143 --> 00:53:09,311
I don't have a good side.

1100
00:53:09,519 --> 00:53:11,146
Let's use the real camera.

1101
00:53:11,271 --> 00:53:12,940
Yeah, right. Right.

1102
00:53:13,065 --> 00:53:14,983
Not something that's really a phone.

1103
00:53:15,108 --> 00:53:16,568
Three.

1104
00:53:16,777 --> 00:53:19,237
One, two...

1105
00:53:19,405 --> 00:53:20,739
Did it work out?

1106
00:53:20,907 --> 00:53:22,782
Really nice to meet you.
- Pleasure.

1107
00:53:24,202 --> 00:53:26,036
Thanks a lot.
- Nice to see you.

1108
00:53:26,204 --> 00:53:28,496
Nice meeting you guys.
- Nice meeting you.

1109
00:53:28,623 --> 00:53:31,041
Thank you.
- Sit, sit, sit, sit.

1110
00:53:32,751 --> 00:53:38,673
Because it's the fucking craziness
afterwards that is kind of killing me.

1111
00:53:38,798 --> 00:53:40,318
It's not the show
that's gonna kill me.

1112
00:53:40,425 --> 00:53:43,094
And there's this whole culture
of backstage,

1113
00:53:43,221 --> 00:53:46,389
and, you know, I have real friends
that I want to talk to,

1114
00:53:46,514 --> 00:53:50,018
but other people just come in,
and I don't even know them.

1115
00:53:50,186 --> 00:53:52,688
Let's have a system...
Where's Jeff Ross?

1116
00:53:52,813 --> 00:53:55,315
We start it with Jeff Ross.
This is not your job.

1117
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:58,693
This is ridiculous.
- Yeah, but I could be like, "Hey, you got to go."

1118
00:53:58,818 --> 00:54:00,403
And then you could be like, "Ooh."

1119
00:54:00,528 --> 00:54:02,239
I could be very authoritative.

1120
00:54:02,364 --> 00:54:04,074
I'm gonna make you a tea...
a throat coat.

1121
00:54:04,282 --> 00:54:05,701
Mom.
- Yes, throat coat.

1122
00:54:05,826 --> 00:54:07,286
No, you don't have to...
Don't make me a throat...

1123
00:54:07,411 --> 00:54:08,371
I don't want to drink that shit.

1124
00:54:08,496 --> 00:54:09,871
Seriously.
- You want it with chamomile?

1125
00:54:09,996 --> 00:54:11,237
No. You know what I want to do?

1126
00:54:11,289 --> 00:54:15,043
Not talk to 100 people, you know,
who I don't even know,

1127
00:54:15,168 --> 00:54:18,755
not have each Coquette
bring in 35 people.

1128
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:21,259
I'd like somebody to help me.

1129
00:54:21,425 --> 00:54:23,302
People take the hinges off the door,

1130
00:54:23,427 --> 00:54:25,972
and everybody from the audience
comes in here afterwards

1131
00:54:26,097 --> 00:54:28,181
and want different combinations of photos.

1132
00:54:28,306 --> 00:54:29,141
"I want a photo.

1133
00:54:29,266 --> 00:54:31,067
Now I want a photo
where you can string dance.

1134
00:54:31,184 --> 00:54:32,519
Can you hold this banana?

1135
00:54:32,644 --> 00:54:35,313
It's a private joke
with my friend from lowa."

1136
00:54:36,983 --> 00:54:38,067
See which Coquette that is.

1137
00:54:39,150 --> 00:54:41,070
We're going in.
There we are, man.

1138
00:54:41,445 --> 00:54:43,155
Borgata. Atlantic City.

1139
00:54:44,322 --> 00:54:46,617
We're gonna hit it,
we're gonna quit it.

1140
00:54:46,742 --> 00:54:48,034
Two shows. One night.

1141
00:54:52,748 --> 00:54:54,208
How are you?
- Good.

1142
00:54:54,333 --> 00:54:55,710
Good. I got to go do
some meet and greet.

1143
00:54:55,835 --> 00:54:57,003
I'll be right back.
- Okay.

1144
00:54:57,128 --> 00:54:58,795
Think I'll give a little piece
of my soul away.

1145
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:00,630
One, two, and three.

1146
00:55:01,423 --> 00:55:03,134
And I know she definitely
wants one one-on-one.

1147
00:55:04,635 --> 00:55:06,846
You made this.
Thank you so much.

1148
00:55:07,012 --> 00:55:10,056
Do you have any advice
how to get our children into Episcopal?

1149
00:55:10,181 --> 00:55:11,057
Uh...

1150
00:55:11,182 --> 00:55:13,561
Idiot! Stupid...

1151
00:55:14,478 --> 00:55:15,730
Fat little man.

1152
00:55:15,938 --> 00:55:18,148
Is that frickin' pizza?
- It's frickin' pizza.

1153
00:55:18,273 --> 00:55:19,567
What's this?
Is this a telegram?

1154
00:55:19,692 --> 00:55:21,610
It's from Jay Leno.

1155
00:55:21,735 --> 00:55:23,237
"Hope stand-up's going well.

1156
00:55:23,362 --> 00:55:26,407
Ha ha. See, it's not so hard after all.
Anyone can do it.

1157
00:55:26,532 --> 00:55:28,242
What's it like to have a soul?"

1158
00:55:28,367 --> 00:55:30,202
I don't even know what he's...

1159
00:55:32,538 --> 00:55:34,664
Oh, they're hardcore about
the support for Conan O'Brien.

1160
00:55:34,789 --> 00:55:36,708
I-A-N.

1161
00:55:36,916 --> 00:55:39,878
"We told The Chin
on his recent trip there..."

1162
00:55:40,003 --> 00:55:41,130
What the fuck?

1163
00:55:41,255 --> 00:55:43,215
"Masturbating bear pizza."

1164
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:46,594
No way.
- "Conan is a hero in our eyes.

1165
00:55:46,719 --> 00:55:49,722
He honorably stepped down,
poked a little fun all the way,

1166
00:55:49,847 --> 00:55:54,434
and dignifiedly let The Chin place himself
on a pedestal of garbage."

1167
00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:56,519
I'm not making this up.
This is real.

1168
00:55:56,644 --> 00:55:57,688
Who is this for?

1169
00:55:57,813 --> 00:56:00,273
This one's Goldie Olson.

1170
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:02,860
"This is a huge and monumental day
in the history of Atlantic City,

1171
00:56:02,985 --> 00:56:06,112
and everyone should roll out the red carpet
for our old Irish pal."

1172
00:56:06,237 --> 00:56:08,449
It looks like terrible, terrible pizza.

1173
00:56:11,911 --> 00:56:14,871
Anyway, the point is,
I'm feeling pretty sexy right now.

1174
00:56:14,996 --> 00:56:15,996
You know how it works.

1175
00:56:16,081 --> 00:56:18,458
Sexy man on tour
equals groupies.

1176
00:56:18,583 --> 00:56:21,003
I'm looking for some
Coco groupies right now.

1177
00:56:21,128 --> 00:56:22,545
We got to find some.

1178
00:56:22,670 --> 00:56:25,132
My friend Andy Richter
has a camera,

1179
00:56:25,257 --> 00:56:26,800
and Andy is gonna
scan the crowd right now,

1180
00:56:26,925 --> 00:56:28,677
and he's gonna find us
some groupies.

1181
00:56:28,802 --> 00:56:30,596
Yes, okay.
Oh, my goodness.

1182
00:56:30,721 --> 00:56:32,722
Whoo! Please keep it...

1183
00:56:32,847 --> 00:56:34,432
What are you doing?

1184
00:56:34,557 --> 00:56:38,103
Are you spanking a pony?
What are you doing?

1185
00:56:38,228 --> 00:56:40,438
Oh, God.

1186
00:56:40,563 --> 00:56:42,900
I don't think we sell that t-shirt.

1187
00:56:43,067 --> 00:56:44,943
Hi.

1188
00:56:45,152 --> 00:56:46,820
Hey. What the fuck?

1189
00:56:46,945 --> 00:56:48,322
Wait a minute.
What is that?

1190
00:56:48,447 --> 00:56:49,726
He knows how to work it.

1191
00:56:51,784 --> 00:56:52,992
Whoo!
- I like your hair.

1192
00:56:53,119 --> 00:56:54,661
Wait. Oh, my God.

1193
00:56:54,954 --> 00:56:56,496
Aah!

1194
00:56:57,289 --> 00:56:59,375
I would.

1195
00:57:02,253 --> 00:57:04,547
Hey, it's me.

1196
00:57:04,672 --> 00:57:07,340
I'm just calling you in between...
in between shows.

1197
00:57:07,465 --> 00:57:09,467
10 minutes, Conan.

1198
00:57:09,592 --> 00:57:10,844
Sona, 10 minutes.

1199
00:57:10,969 --> 00:57:12,304
See that crowd right there?

1200
00:57:12,429 --> 00:57:14,139
That's the crowd tonight.
That's tonight's crowd.

1201
00:57:14,347 --> 00:57:16,307
I'm like, "Hey, how you folks doing?"

1202
00:57:16,434 --> 00:57:18,726
Yeah! Kick 'em in the face!

1203
00:57:18,893 --> 00:57:20,563
Powder.

1204
00:57:20,688 --> 00:57:22,481
Oh, sweet powder.

1205
00:57:23,898 --> 00:57:26,277
Protect my skin, powder.

1206
00:57:26,402 --> 00:57:28,112
Absorb all moistures.

1207
00:57:28,778 --> 00:57:32,157
Oh, powder.
Sweet powder.

1208
00:57:32,282 --> 00:57:35,911
Paint the illusion
my skin is dry.

1209
00:57:36,327 --> 00:57:37,163
Oh, powder.

1210
00:57:37,288 --> 00:57:39,539
Shut the fuck up.
You got a show to do.

1211
00:57:39,664 --> 00:57:41,625
Oh, powder.

1212
00:57:43,085 --> 00:57:45,920
I can't... I can't breathe.

1213
00:57:46,045 --> 00:57:48,090
Powder,
your natural enemy is sweat.

1214
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:54,054
I walked away
from the greatest franchise in history

1215
00:57:54,262 --> 00:57:56,097
'cause I refused
to go on at midnight,

1216
00:57:56,222 --> 00:57:57,891
and here I am on at midnight.

1217
00:57:59,434 --> 00:58:01,103
Hey, folks,
how you doing tonight?

1218
00:58:01,228 --> 00:58:02,396
We're great.

1219
00:58:02,521 --> 00:58:05,440
Okay, that was horrible.
How are you doing tonight?

1220
00:58:05,565 --> 00:58:07,525
We're great!

1221
00:58:07,650 --> 00:58:09,445
Are you enjoying the show so far?

1222
00:58:09,695 --> 00:58:12,655
Yeah, it's fine.

1223
00:58:14,199 --> 00:58:16,452
It's fine?
It's fine?

1224
00:58:16,619 --> 00:58:18,369
I'm trying to give you
the best show I can.

1225
00:58:18,496 --> 00:58:19,954
If I'm not doing something
you want to see,

1226
00:58:20,164 --> 00:58:21,748
you got to tell me right now.

1227
00:58:22,081 --> 00:58:24,501
Kiss LaBamba!

1228
00:58:26,085 --> 00:58:27,128
No.

1229
00:58:27,338 --> 00:58:30,507
Kiss him
like he's your girlfriend

1230
00:58:30,632 --> 00:58:33,677
and you've been on a submarine
for six months.

1231
00:58:35,679 --> 00:58:37,056
Let's get out of here.

1232
00:58:37,181 --> 00:58:39,807
Let's make like a cold wind and blow.

1233
00:58:42,061 --> 00:58:43,603
Another day, another dollar.

1234
00:58:43,811 --> 00:58:45,563
¶ On the road again ¶

1235
00:58:47,023 --> 00:58:49,943
¶ I just can't wait
to get on the road again ¶

1236
00:58:50,318 --> 00:58:51,027
¶ Wa-ooh ¶

1237
00:58:51,152 --> 00:58:54,822
¶ The life I love is making music
with my friends ¶

1238
00:58:55,032 --> 00:58:56,992
¶ I can't wait to get on the road again ¶

1239
00:58:57,201 --> 00:58:59,577
Why are we stopped here?

1240
00:59:01,789 --> 00:59:05,000
I'm getting off this goddamned bus
and finding out what's happening.

1241
00:59:05,125 --> 00:59:07,043
Boy, this will be good.

1242
00:59:07,168 --> 00:59:09,255
Okay, Sona, what's happening?
Why did the bus stop?

1243
00:59:10,088 --> 00:59:11,590
How are you?
What's your name?

1244
00:59:11,715 --> 00:59:12,800
Elaine.
- Elaine.

1245
00:59:12,925 --> 00:59:13,842
Oh, my God.
- Hey, Lindsay.

1246
00:59:13,967 --> 00:59:15,427
How are you?
- I'm Jen.

1247
00:59:15,552 --> 00:59:17,304
How's it going?
We're headed to Boston.

1248
00:59:17,429 --> 00:59:18,931
I have a band, and...

1249
00:59:19,139 --> 00:59:21,224
So, I do comedy,
but then I jump in with them

1250
00:59:21,349 --> 00:59:23,018
'cause I play guitar and sing,

1251
00:59:23,143 --> 00:59:24,436
and we do...
it's a mix.

1252
00:59:24,561 --> 00:59:26,271
I like your glasses.
Those are cool.

1253
00:59:26,396 --> 00:59:28,481
You like this?
- Yeah. Yeah.

1254
00:59:28,606 --> 00:59:30,108
Take care.
Nice to meet you.

1255
00:59:30,233 --> 00:59:31,777
Nice to meet you.
Bye-bye.

1256
00:59:31,902 --> 00:59:33,278
Keep the bling.
Get more bling.

1257
00:59:33,403 --> 00:59:35,155
Yeah, we wish you all the best.

1258
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:37,115
I'm sorry they did what they did.

1259
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:38,909
No, you know what?
I was sorry at the time, too,

1260
00:59:39,034 --> 00:59:41,244
and then it turns out to be...
I wouldn't have been able...

1261
00:59:41,369 --> 00:59:43,496
I wouldn't have been able
to do the tour.

1262
00:59:43,621 --> 00:59:45,958
We're headed to Martha's Vineyard.

1263
00:59:46,083 --> 00:59:47,626
Ooh, that's gonna be nice.

1264
00:59:47,751 --> 00:59:49,460
Can we pray for you?

1265
00:59:49,586 --> 00:59:51,045
Can you what?
- Pray for you?

1266
00:59:51,170 --> 00:59:52,672
Oh, pray for me?
Sure, you can.

1267
00:59:52,797 --> 00:59:53,798
Yeah.

1268
00:59:53,923 --> 00:59:56,217
Dear God, I thank you, Father,
for this moment, oh, God,

1269
00:59:56,342 --> 01:00:01,222
for allowing us to meet Conan O'Brien,
Lord, on our journey, Father,

1270
01:00:01,347 --> 01:00:05,059
but I'm asking, oh, God,
that you open doors for this man, oh, God,

1271
01:00:05,268 --> 01:00:08,021
that his finances
are in your hands, oh, God.

1272
01:00:08,146 --> 01:00:10,273
Keep him safe and his family, God.

1273
01:00:10,398 --> 01:00:14,360
Bless him unconditionally,
in Jesus' name. Amen.

1274
01:00:14,485 --> 01:00:16,362
Wow.
That's really beautiful.

1275
01:00:16,487 --> 01:00:17,864
Thank you for doing that.
- Take care.

1276
01:00:17,989 --> 01:00:20,326
There's a reason why you're here
and we're here.

1277
01:00:20,451 --> 01:00:23,704
¶ I can't wait to get
on the road again ¶

1278
01:00:24,829 --> 01:00:27,625
¶ Dear God, please let me
have a show again ¶

1279
01:00:27,750 --> 01:00:31,085
So, we'll stay over
after the second Boston show,

1280
01:00:31,210 --> 01:00:33,505
leave in the afternoon
as late as possible,

1281
01:00:33,630 --> 01:00:36,800
probably 3:00
to go to Uncasville,

1282
01:00:36,925 --> 01:00:38,677
where we're on
after the basketball game.

1283
01:00:38,802 --> 01:00:41,929
Then we'll overnight
after that to Nashville.

1284
01:00:42,056 --> 01:00:44,224
It's an 11-hour drive.

1285
01:00:44,432 --> 01:00:46,518
Can we talk about Bonnaroo
for two minutes?

1286
01:00:46,643 --> 01:00:48,061
Oh, nice.

1287
01:00:48,269 --> 01:00:50,898
The dressing-room situation
is very primitive.

1288
01:00:51,023 --> 01:00:52,900
One of the van buses
will be backstage.

1289
01:00:53,025 --> 01:00:54,400
That's fine.
You look at me.

1290
01:00:54,525 --> 01:00:56,110
I'm a road dog now.
- I know.

1291
01:00:56,235 --> 01:00:57,737
Don't you worry about me.

1292
01:00:57,862 --> 01:01:00,074
I'll piss in a bucket,
I'll shit in your hat.

1293
01:01:00,199 --> 01:01:01,532
It doesn't matter to me.

1294
01:01:02,992 --> 01:01:04,994
I know you don't enjoy
"Rock this Town",

1295
01:01:05,119 --> 01:01:07,246
but I have more fun doing that
than anything else,

1296
01:01:07,373 --> 01:01:08,733
and I'm entitled to have some fun.

1297
01:01:08,791 --> 01:01:11,710
Yeah, but at whose expense?

1298
01:01:18,884 --> 01:01:20,719
Bye-bye, Beantown.

1299
01:01:20,844 --> 01:01:23,179
There are showers in here,
but they look very suspicious.

1300
01:01:23,304 --> 01:01:25,431
I'm not sure I love
these Wang showers.

1301
01:01:25,556 --> 01:01:27,266
I'm suspicious, but I think
I have to take a shower.

1302
01:01:27,393 --> 01:01:28,893
What's the worst
that could happen?

1303
01:01:36,735 --> 01:01:39,195
Thank you.
- Thanks, Conan.

1304
01:01:39,405 --> 01:01:41,239
No pictures, guys.
No pictures, guys.

1305
01:01:41,364 --> 01:01:44,576
No pictures, guys.
No pictures, guys.

1306
01:01:46,829 --> 01:01:48,288
No pictures.

1307
01:01:48,496 --> 01:01:50,791
They don't let us keep
these buses here.

1308
01:01:50,958 --> 01:01:53,001
Bye, Conan!

1309
01:01:53,126 --> 01:01:56,255
See you guys in a while.

1310
01:01:59,590 --> 01:02:02,635
Hi, Mr. O'Brien.
My name's Andy.

1311
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:03,804
Just don't speak to me.

1312
01:02:03,929 --> 01:02:05,556
All right, I won't.
Don't worry.

1313
01:02:05,681 --> 01:02:10,768
The entire ride home, don't worry.
I won't say a word to you.

1314
01:02:12,813 --> 01:02:14,481
you lived here
for 20 years of your life,

1315
01:02:14,606 --> 01:02:16,442
and you have an emotional
connection with this town?

1316
01:02:16,567 --> 01:02:17,317
Yeah.

1317
01:02:17,443 --> 01:02:18,693
I really like this town.
But I didn't...

1318
01:02:18,818 --> 01:02:21,697
I'm not from here, so I never felt
like this was my home.

1319
01:02:21,822 --> 01:02:23,449
But now I don't even feel
like Boston's my home.

1320
01:02:23,574 --> 01:02:25,576
Los Angeles doesn't really feel
like my home.

1321
01:02:25,701 --> 01:02:27,619
I don't know where my home is.

1322
01:02:27,786 --> 01:02:28,871
Hey, Chelsea.
- Hi. How are you?

1323
01:02:29,079 --> 01:02:30,621
Would you like to do
any photos or anything?

1324
01:02:30,748 --> 01:02:32,039
It it okay to do
one of these things?

1325
01:02:32,166 --> 01:02:33,000
I can...

1326
01:02:33,125 --> 01:02:34,543
But you won't?
- Okay.

1327
01:02:34,668 --> 01:02:36,503
What the fuck?
You do that, you do this.

1328
01:02:36,628 --> 01:02:38,130
It's all about moving these hips.

1329
01:02:38,255 --> 01:02:40,047
I love Flight of the Conchords.

1330
01:02:40,173 --> 01:02:41,759
Oh, thank you.
- So nice to meet you.

1331
01:02:41,884 --> 01:02:42,885
Nice to meet you, too.

1332
01:02:43,010 --> 01:02:45,179
Um, let me see
if he's still talking to her.

1333
01:02:45,304 --> 01:02:46,384
Oh, hi.
- Hi. How are you?

1334
01:02:46,429 --> 01:02:47,639
Good. I'm Kristen.
- Hi.

1335
01:02:47,764 --> 01:02:49,056
Nice to meet you.
- It's nice to meet you, too.

1336
01:02:49,182 --> 01:02:50,184
I just wanted
to give you a present.

1337
01:02:50,309 --> 01:02:51,809
Look at that.
That's great.

1338
01:02:51,934 --> 01:02:54,271
Thanks, dude.
All right, bye.

1339
01:02:57,648 --> 01:02:58,929
You think David Hockney's queer?

1340
01:02:58,983 --> 01:03:00,777
No. I said it's hot in here.

1341
01:03:00,902 --> 01:03:02,612
I haven't talked to Sweeney yet

1342
01:03:02,737 --> 01:03:04,322
about the plan with Colbert.

1343
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:06,327
Is it a surprise?
Is he just gonna walk onstage?

1344
01:03:06,449 --> 01:03:07,534
I don't... This is the least re...

1345
01:03:07,659 --> 01:03:08,818
I mean, there's no rehearsal.

1346
01:03:08,911 --> 01:03:11,454
I hereby grant to you...
- No!

1347
01:03:11,579 --> 01:03:13,456
Right. You do one of those.
- That's great.

1348
01:03:13,581 --> 01:03:15,291
So, they know to stop the music
when you get hurt?

1349
01:03:15,416 --> 01:03:16,416
Do they know to stop...

1350
01:03:16,501 --> 01:03:17,543
No. I'm gonna tell them.

1351
01:03:23,342 --> 01:03:25,010
Conan O'Brien.

1352
01:03:25,219 --> 01:03:26,969
You challenge me...

1353
01:03:27,094 --> 01:03:28,094
Then I give you another.

1354
01:03:28,137 --> 01:03:29,722
So, you dance first. Right.

1355
01:03:29,847 --> 01:03:32,391
Then I... then maybe we go together.

1356
01:03:32,559 --> 01:03:34,936
And then, Jon... you walk out
and you stop it.

1357
01:03:35,061 --> 01:03:37,146
You stop the music.

1358
01:03:37,356 --> 01:03:39,900
Okay, you should get ready.

1359
01:03:40,900 --> 01:03:42,527
Andy comes out and shoots Jon.

1360
01:03:42,652 --> 01:03:46,072
Andy shoots Jon.
- Wait, what?

1361
01:03:46,197 --> 01:03:48,032
That's a bit lazy.

1362
01:03:48,157 --> 01:03:51,452
Does anyone here think
that seems a bit lazy?

1363
01:03:54,706 --> 01:03:56,250
That was
a big milestone to get past...

1364
01:03:56,375 --> 01:03:58,001
I mean, to do, you know?

1365
01:03:58,126 --> 01:04:00,128
Radio City, New York.

1366
01:04:00,253 --> 01:04:02,213
Thanks for holding the elevator.
- Yeah, thanks for doing that.

1367
01:04:02,338 --> 01:04:03,757
Oh, no problem.
No problem, Mr. O'Brien.

1368
01:04:03,882 --> 01:04:04,882
Conan. Call me Conan.

1369
01:04:04,925 --> 01:04:06,717
Yes, sir.
- See? "Sir."

1370
01:04:06,844 --> 01:04:09,721
He called me "sir."
No one calls me "sir."

1371
01:04:09,847 --> 01:04:10,931
I don't call you "sir."

1372
01:04:11,139 --> 01:04:12,682
Talk to me for a second.

1373
01:04:12,807 --> 01:04:13,851
Hey-
- Hey-

1374
01:04:13,976 --> 01:04:14,726
It seemed good.

1375
01:04:14,851 --> 01:04:18,396
You gave this audience so much.

1376
01:04:18,605 --> 01:04:20,481
They have no faces left.

1377
01:04:25,570 --> 01:04:26,737
Oh, my.
- What is it?

1378
01:04:26,864 --> 01:04:28,489
No, they just have barricades up

1379
01:04:28,614 --> 01:04:30,534
'cause there's quite
a few people out there.

1380
01:04:30,659 --> 01:04:31,827
Here we go.
I'm not going to bed.

1381
01:04:31,952 --> 01:04:34,161
Oh, no, no, no, no.
You are not going out.

1382
01:04:34,288 --> 01:04:35,581
Yeah, I'm not.
I can't go to bed.

1383
01:04:35,706 --> 01:04:37,291
I'm not gonna go home...
Jeff, you don't get it.

1384
01:04:37,416 --> 01:04:39,083
I can't go from this
to doing what?

1385
01:04:39,208 --> 01:04:41,378
Sitting and reading a Kindle?
That's not gonna fucking happen.

1386
01:04:45,047 --> 01:04:46,632
Hey. Hey, buddy!

1387
01:04:46,757 --> 01:04:48,510
Hi. How are you?
- How are you?

1388
01:04:48,635 --> 01:04:50,355
Hi. Thanks for coming.
You guys are awesome.

1389
01:04:50,387 --> 01:04:51,597
Guys, I can sign things.

1390
01:04:51,722 --> 01:04:54,266
It's kind of hard to take photos
with everybody, you know.

1391
01:04:54,391 --> 01:04:56,893
Come on.
- Oh, you mean just for you, you mean?

1392
01:04:57,018 --> 01:04:58,728
You're the nicest guy.
Come on.

1393
01:04:58,853 --> 01:05:00,771
That guy said
that was the only one.

1394
01:05:00,898 --> 01:05:04,400
Oh, so I guess
that guy was lying.

1395
01:05:04,525 --> 01:05:06,737
I guess that guy was a dick.

1396
01:05:06,862 --> 01:05:08,739
Guys, we're done
with the pictures, 'cause...

1397
01:05:08,864 --> 01:05:11,449
"Come on!"
Is that your catchphrase?

1398
01:05:11,574 --> 01:05:13,452
You can keep saying,
"Come on, come on",

1399
01:05:13,577 --> 01:05:16,788
but it's really
not coming across too well.

1400
01:05:18,289 --> 01:05:19,498
Can we get a picture?

1401
01:05:19,625 --> 01:05:21,376
It's much easier to sign stuff.

1402
01:05:21,501 --> 01:05:23,628
Hey, everybody, I got to go.
Thank you so much!

1403
01:05:24,922 --> 01:05:27,173
See you.

1404
01:05:27,840 --> 01:05:29,675
Can you shut that fucking door?

1405
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:31,320
Thank you.
- Take care. See you, man.

1406
01:05:31,427 --> 01:05:32,887
Thanks.

1407
01:05:33,597 --> 01:05:38,351
From here on in, I want to make sure
that the days off are really days off.

1408
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:41,228
I Bagpipes playing 1

1409
01:05:48,487 --> 01:05:50,572
Why do I feel
like a fireman died?

1410
01:06:04,251 --> 01:06:06,380
We are 2 minutes away to start.

1411
01:06:06,505 --> 01:06:08,590
Oh, there's a TV
over there in the corner.

1412
01:06:08,715 --> 01:06:12,052
Does someone want to monitor
what the show's...

1413
01:06:14,429 --> 01:06:16,139
How far are we
into the schedule?

1414
01:06:16,264 --> 01:06:17,891
Please tell me. How much further
do we have to go?

1415
01:06:18,016 --> 01:06:20,059
Top of page 2.
- And where am I?

1416
01:06:20,184 --> 01:06:21,811
It doesn't really matter how many.

1417
01:06:21,936 --> 01:06:23,456
Stop saying that.
- It's 10-minute...

1418
01:06:23,521 --> 01:06:25,402
It's how many 10-minute
performances before you.

1419
01:06:25,523 --> 01:06:27,192
We're dead. It's over.

1420
01:06:27,317 --> 01:06:29,068
I want everyone on the bus.
We're getting out of here.

1421
01:06:29,193 --> 01:06:31,153
This is crazy.
It's gonna be 11:30.

1422
01:06:37,034 --> 01:06:39,413
What's happening now?
What's happening?

1423
01:06:39,538 --> 01:06:42,123
68 minutes from now,
you will take the stage.

1424
01:06:42,248 --> 01:06:44,751
68 minutes from now?
- 68 minutes from now,

1425
01:06:44,876 --> 01:06:46,420
if they stick
to the schedule closely.

1426
01:06:46,545 --> 01:06:47,795
I need a cab.

1427
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:49,463
I'm going to the Four Seasons Hotel.

1428
01:06:49,588 --> 01:06:52,259
I would give that a 20% upside.

1429
01:07:00,266 --> 01:07:03,769
¶ I'm goin' to Baltimore ¶

1430
01:07:03,894 --> 01:07:08,315
¶ Far from this opera
forever more ¶

1431
01:07:44,936 --> 01:07:47,313
Oh, not a mime. No.

1432
01:07:47,563 --> 01:07:49,523
40 minutes behind schedule.

1433
01:07:53,945 --> 01:07:56,572
I thought it was
a bad idea to have...

1434
01:07:56,697 --> 01:08:00,659
What if I run right now...
Just said, "This has to... Stop it."

1435
01:08:01,619 --> 01:08:02,746
Just stop it.

1436
01:08:02,871 --> 01:08:04,789
Just stop it.

1437
01:08:11,253 --> 01:08:12,505
¶ Come on ¶

1438
01:08:16,092 --> 01:08:17,176
¶ Well, my baby and me ¶

1439
01:08:17,301 --> 01:08:19,887
¶ We went out last Saturday night ¶

1440
01:08:20,012 --> 01:08:21,722
¶ I had my hair piled high ¶

1441
01:08:21,847 --> 01:08:24,016
¶ My baby, she looked so right ¶

1442
01:08:24,141 --> 01:08:26,978
¶ Well, pick you up at 10:00,
have you home by 2:00 ¶

1443
01:08:27,104 --> 01:08:28,814
¶ Mama don't know
what's in store for you ¶

1444
01:08:28,939 --> 01:08:29,980
¶ That's all right ¶

1445
01:08:30,106 --> 01:08:31,858
¶ We're looking
as good as can be ¶

1446
01:08:31,983 --> 01:08:34,528
¶ Well, we're gonna rock this town ¶

1447
01:08:34,653 --> 01:08:36,738
¶ Rock it inside out ¶

1448
01:08:36,863 --> 01:08:38,782
¶ Yeah, we gonna rock this town ¶

1449
01:08:38,907 --> 01:08:40,992
¶ Gonna make you swing and shout ¶

1450
01:08:41,118 --> 01:08:42,202
¶ Yeah ¶

1451
01:08:42,327 --> 01:08:44,162
¶ Rock, rock, rock, rock ¶

1452
01:08:44,287 --> 01:08:45,872
¶ Rock till we pop,
we're gonna roll till we drop ¶

1453
01:08:45,997 --> 01:08:47,457
¶ I'm gonna rock this town ¶

1454
01:08:47,582 --> 01:08:48,917
¶ And rip this place apart ¶

1455
01:08:51,002 --> 01:08:52,212
Hold my hand.

1456
01:08:52,337 --> 01:08:56,382
Takeoff's always the hardest part.

1457
01:09:02,764 --> 01:09:06,225
Your vocal?
- I couldn't hear it great, actually.

1458
01:09:06,350 --> 01:09:07,351
It's better now.

1459
01:09:09,186 --> 01:09:11,564
¶ Oooh, well ¶

1460
01:09:12,858 --> 01:09:14,150
Why don't you try it?

1461
01:09:14,275 --> 01:09:16,694
¶ Ohh, Well ¶

1462
01:09:16,862 --> 01:09:18,904
¶ One, two flights,
three flights, four ¶

1463
01:09:19,029 --> 01:09:20,909
¶ Five, six, seven flights,
eight flights more ¶

1464
01:09:21,032 --> 01:09:23,159
¶ That's the time
I'm starting to drag ¶

1465
01:09:23,284 --> 01:09:25,453
¶ 15th floor, I'm ready to sag ¶

1466
01:09:25,578 --> 01:09:28,038
¶ Get to the top,
I'm too tired to rock ¶

1467
01:09:55,233 --> 01:09:57,194
¶ One, two flights,
three flights, four ¶

1468
01:09:57,319 --> 01:09:59,279
¶ Five, six, seven flights,
eight flights more ¶

1469
01:09:59,404 --> 01:10:01,363
¶ About this time
I'm starting to drag ¶

1470
01:10:01,488 --> 01:10:03,490
¶ 15th floor, I'm ready to sag ¶

1471
01:10:03,699 --> 01:10:06,953
¶ Get to the top
and I'm too tired to rock ¶

1472
01:10:19,423 --> 01:10:21,717
Jack White!

1473
01:10:21,842 --> 01:10:23,177
I think that's it.

1474
01:10:23,302 --> 01:10:25,221
I'm going to the hospital now.

1475
01:10:30,268 --> 01:10:32,229
Sorry I missed you.

1476
01:10:32,354 --> 01:10:34,064
Ah, it's too small a space.

1477
01:10:34,230 --> 01:10:37,859
One thing. No photos.
One thing. No photos.

1478
01:10:38,068 --> 01:10:39,985
One thing. Hello.
Speak English?

1479
01:10:40,110 --> 01:10:42,154
One thing. No photos.
Right on.

1480
01:10:42,279 --> 01:10:43,155
One thing. No photos.

1481
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:44,573
One thing. No photos.

1482
01:10:44,698 --> 01:10:45,951
It's actually my shirt.

1483
01:10:48,161 --> 01:10:49,871
Hey.

1484
01:10:50,121 --> 01:10:52,164
Thank you.

1485
01:10:57,628 --> 01:10:59,797
It's like being in a zoo.

1486
01:11:17,274 --> 01:11:19,900
Ooh, drum tower!

1487
01:11:20,318 --> 01:11:21,778
I hate these.

1488
01:11:21,903 --> 01:11:23,488
I think these look like shit.

1489
01:11:23,613 --> 01:11:26,032
They don't look good.
- They don't look good.

1490
01:11:26,157 --> 01:11:27,533
I'm a known human being.

1491
01:11:27,658 --> 01:11:29,661
I can't be seen looking like this.

1492
01:11:29,868 --> 01:11:32,079
I'm gonna look like a freak.

1493
01:11:32,204 --> 01:11:33,914
Andy...
- You look good. You look good.

1494
01:11:35,500 --> 01:11:37,585
It's all a fashion thing, Andy.
For Christ's sake.

1495
01:11:37,711 --> 01:11:40,030
And I can't wear a white hat
if you're wearing a white hat.

1496
01:11:40,921 --> 01:11:42,548
Oh, good.
It's miserable again.

1497
01:11:43,300 --> 01:11:45,217
This is ours
until right after the show.

1498
01:11:45,342 --> 01:11:47,582
What about that?
- You want to do... anything you want.

1499
01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:49,480
This is all stuff
I bought for you for today.

1500
01:11:49,596 --> 01:11:51,725
Don't talk to me like I'm a child.

1501
01:11:51,850 --> 01:11:54,185
Don't put up with it.
Just stand up for yourself.

1502
01:11:54,310 --> 01:11:57,021
"Raw" suit?
Oh, poor Conan.

1503
01:11:59,149 --> 01:12:03,110
People started lining up today
at 5:30 for this show.

1504
01:12:03,319 --> 01:12:06,864
So, we're gonna do a bunch
of jokes about saps?

1505
01:12:27,886 --> 01:12:32,599
15 minutes ago, they told me
the air-conditioning went out in this tent.

1506
01:12:35,726 --> 01:12:40,023
It's like we're doing comedy
in a Native American sweat lodge.

1507
01:12:40,606 --> 01:12:43,359
This is great. In 6 months,
I've gone from hosting "The Tonight Show"

1508
01:12:43,484 --> 01:12:45,862
to performing at a refugee camp.

1509
01:12:48,823 --> 01:12:50,502
You seem to want to get
a picture close up.

1510
01:12:50,574 --> 01:12:52,034
Do you? Do you want
to get a closer picture?

1511
01:12:52,159 --> 01:12:53,953
Come on up.
That's okay. That's all right.

1512
01:12:54,078 --> 01:12:55,913
It's all fine.

1513
01:12:56,914 --> 01:12:58,123
Let's get a picture together.

1514
01:12:59,250 --> 01:13:00,835
Right here.
Let's turn this way.

1515
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:02,545
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1516
01:13:02,670 --> 01:13:04,506
Right here.
This is all Bonnaroo, baby.

1517
01:13:10,804 --> 01:13:11,805
I love you.

1518
01:13:14,015 --> 01:13:16,850
Where are you going?

1519
01:13:16,975 --> 01:13:18,560
Come back.

1520
01:13:31,115 --> 01:13:32,783
Yeah!

1521
01:13:38,288 --> 01:13:39,832
Two words to you, buddy.

1522
01:13:39,957 --> 01:13:41,000
You're amazing.

1523
01:13:41,126 --> 01:13:42,565
Why? Why today
and not any other day?

1524
01:13:42,668 --> 01:13:44,671
I'll tell you later.

1525
01:13:44,796 --> 01:13:45,796
You will?

1526
01:13:47,506 --> 01:13:49,466
That's me. Whenever I hear
someone say "That was amazing",

1527
01:13:49,591 --> 01:13:51,845
I think, "What was wrong
with the other ones?"

1528
01:13:59,476 --> 01:14:00,686
He got stopped, of course.

1529
01:14:00,811 --> 01:14:02,479
When I first met Jack,

1530
01:14:02,689 --> 01:14:04,689
it was a couple years
before the White Stripes hit,

1531
01:14:04,774 --> 01:14:06,373
and I was in a bowling alley in Detroit.

1532
01:14:06,443 --> 01:14:07,443
Conan, we got to run.

1533
01:14:07,484 --> 01:14:09,279
I know.
Just give me one second.

1534
01:14:15,076 --> 01:14:16,786
I guess you're good?
- Thank you, Missy.

1535
01:14:17,996 --> 01:14:21,082
This is Nella Page.
- Oh, my goodness.

1536
01:14:21,207 --> 01:14:23,376
As in Jimmy,
and that's Alex Lennon.

1537
01:14:25,170 --> 01:14:27,505
Good. Great. Thank you.

1538
01:14:27,671 --> 01:14:32,551
I mean, can it be something as easy
as just coming out and saying,

1539
01:14:32,676 --> 01:14:35,012
"How's everybody doing? Blah.
You can be louder. Blah."

1540
01:14:35,137 --> 01:14:38,140
And then be like, "Here. Here's
the fucking nuts" or something.

1541
01:14:38,265 --> 01:14:41,685
I mean, couldn't it be just like, literally,
"How you doing?", one joke and then...

1542
01:14:41,810 --> 01:14:45,648
Again, I don't think you're contractually
obligated to do bits out there.

1543
01:14:45,773 --> 01:14:47,065
No, it's not that.

1544
01:14:47,192 --> 01:14:49,903
I'm always disheartened

1545
01:14:50,028 --> 01:14:52,627
when the people that actually made
the arrangement are never here.

1546
01:14:52,697 --> 01:14:53,823
Right. Right.

1547
01:14:53,948 --> 01:14:56,951
No one's here. Nobody ever knows
what the fuck they're talking about.

1548
01:14:57,076 --> 01:14:59,453
It's always, "Yeah, yeah, it'll be fine.
It'll be fine. It'll be fine."

1549
01:14:59,578 --> 01:15:01,372
And then Jeff's on a plane,
and later he can say,

1550
01:15:01,497 --> 01:15:02,748
"I didn't know. I didn't know."

1551
01:15:02,873 --> 01:15:04,434
It's almost over.
- I know.

1552
01:15:04,542 --> 01:15:08,587
People keep saying that, but that's
what they said to Anne Frank, you know?

1553
01:15:08,712 --> 01:15:10,672
You did not just
compare yourself to Anne Frank.

1554
01:15:10,797 --> 01:15:12,382
You didn't do that.
- We both took a stand.

1555
01:15:12,509 --> 01:15:15,220
My point is that I definitely
got signed up for too much.

1556
01:15:15,345 --> 01:15:16,345
I know.

1557
01:15:16,429 --> 01:15:19,349
And moving forward, you know,
there's a lot of not...

1558
01:15:19,474 --> 01:15:21,768
No one's thinking
about burning me out.

1559
01:15:21,893 --> 01:15:23,060
Nobody's thinking about it.

1560
01:15:23,185 --> 01:15:25,813
And when I burn out and everyone
doesn't have a job anymore,

1561
01:15:25,939 --> 01:15:27,481
they're gonna be pissed.

1562
01:15:27,606 --> 01:15:30,902
We have to be thinking about,
like, "Wait a minute. Really?

1563
01:15:31,027 --> 01:15:34,530
He's doing a whole day with Jack White
and he's doing Bonnaroo

1564
01:15:34,655 --> 01:15:36,936
and he's introducing all the acts
and he's gonna stay late

1565
01:15:37,033 --> 01:15:39,409
and introduce Jay-Z
and Stevie Wonder?"

1566
01:15:39,536 --> 01:15:41,328
Jim is informing me that, you know,

1567
01:15:41,453 --> 01:15:44,623
the festival would like more
than just a line or two.

1568
01:15:44,748 --> 01:15:46,751
Just... that's been their take all along.

1569
01:15:46,876 --> 01:15:49,503
I honestly... I didn't even know
he was introducing

1570
01:15:49,628 --> 01:15:51,421
until I e-mailed Jeff two days ago.

1571
01:15:51,547 --> 01:15:53,466
I thought he was introducing one act.

1572
01:15:53,591 --> 01:15:55,467
One act every three hours.

1573
01:15:55,592 --> 01:15:57,761
Okay.
- I hate Jeff right now.

1574
01:15:57,970 --> 01:15:59,305
Let's start at the beginning.

1575
01:15:59,430 --> 01:16:01,140
We've got Nas and Goo Goo.

1576
01:16:01,265 --> 01:16:05,811
Let's start thinking of funny lines
for Nas and Goo Goo and how to do it,

1577
01:16:05,936 --> 01:16:07,313
and then we'll get through that.

1578
01:16:07,438 --> 01:16:09,940
Then it's on to the 55 other things
I have to introduce

1579
01:16:10,065 --> 01:16:13,403
that someone at WME agreed to
that Jeff checked off on a box.

1580
01:16:13,569 --> 01:16:18,448
Do you like reggae
without all the drug-king violence?

1581
01:16:18,574 --> 01:16:21,118
You're in the right place.

1582
01:16:21,243 --> 01:16:23,412
There's been trouble
down in Sri Lanka.

1583
01:16:24,872 --> 01:16:27,917
People told me when a comedian
comes out in front of a festival crowd,

1584
01:16:28,042 --> 01:16:30,420
he should keep it short
and get right to the music.

1585
01:16:30,545 --> 01:16:32,130
But I'm gonna go a different way.

1586
01:16:34,006 --> 01:16:39,595
I'm about to do two hours
on the life of Bess Truman.

1587
01:16:40,596 --> 01:16:42,306
Everyone have a seat.
This is gonna take a while.

1588
01:16:42,431 --> 01:16:43,307
No, I'm telling you,

1589
01:16:43,432 --> 01:16:45,601
all you got to do is say,
"Are you ready to rock?"

1590
01:16:45,726 --> 01:16:48,186
Or hip-hop or whatever the fuck it is.

1591
01:16:50,480 --> 01:16:52,483
Here we go.
It's Nas and the Nozzles.

1592
01:16:52,609 --> 01:16:54,068
No, no, no,
we have some good stuff.

1593
01:16:54,193 --> 01:16:55,694
I do a whole thing
about Bess Truman.

1594
01:16:55,819 --> 01:16:58,614
I'll find you later.
- Bess Truman?

1595
01:16:58,905 --> 01:17:00,033
Just listen.

1596
01:17:00,158 --> 01:17:01,618
All right, this is embarrassing,

1597
01:17:01,743 --> 01:17:04,787
but someone's gonna have to help me
write these names on my hand.

1598
01:17:04,912 --> 01:17:07,912
'Cause I'm telling you, I'll get out there,
and my life is so fucking crazy,

1599
01:17:07,957 --> 01:17:09,708
that's all I need
in front of 70.000 people

1600
01:17:09,833 --> 01:17:11,377
is to forget Nas and Jojo.

1601
01:17:11,502 --> 01:17:12,878
Just put N-O-Z-Z.

1602
01:17:13,087 --> 01:17:14,588
Are you guys ready to rock?

1603
01:17:14,713 --> 01:17:16,173
Yeah!

1604
01:17:16,298 --> 01:17:18,216
Okay, that's nice,
but not quite accurate.

1605
01:17:18,342 --> 01:17:20,927
Are we ready to reggae?

1606
01:17:23,555 --> 01:17:24,681
Are you ready to...
and hip-hop.

1607
01:17:24,806 --> 01:17:25,932
Yeah, and hip-hop.

1608
01:17:26,059 --> 01:17:29,395
Are you ready to get your freak on
in 95% humidity?

1609
01:17:31,271 --> 01:17:33,440
Yeah! We be jammin'.

1610
01:17:33,649 --> 01:17:37,569
Ladies and gentlemen,
Damian Marley.

1611
01:17:37,737 --> 01:17:39,738
And Nas!

1612
01:17:48,706 --> 01:17:51,083
How are you?
How do you do?

1613
01:17:56,546 --> 01:17:58,298
I do, too. I do, too.

1614
01:17:58,423 --> 01:17:59,884
Sona?

1615
01:18:02,595 --> 01:18:04,471
Why?
- Because it's a habit.

1616
01:18:04,639 --> 01:18:06,599
And sometimes...
- it's all good. It's all good.

1617
01:18:06,682 --> 01:18:07,891
I'm cool.

1618
01:18:08,016 --> 01:18:11,770
I'm not doing it out of nervousness,
'cause I have complete faith in you.

1619
01:18:11,895 --> 01:18:13,146
Are you ready to rock?

1620
01:18:14,899 --> 01:18:17,359
Are you ready to laugh?

1621
01:18:18,569 --> 01:18:21,113
Well, gentlemen,
good luck to both of you.

1622
01:18:21,238 --> 01:18:25,326
Are you ready to rock and laugh
but first urinate?

1623
01:18:26,743 --> 01:18:28,829
Who's urinating now?

1624
01:18:30,707 --> 01:18:35,712
Ladies and gentlemen,
give it up for Tenacious D!

1625
01:18:43,344 --> 01:18:45,887
You have 40.000 people
in the palm of your hand.

1626
01:18:46,055 --> 01:18:50,393
It was like seeing Hitler up there,
but like a nicer version.

1627
01:18:52,228 --> 01:18:57,190
In just a couple of minutes
is the great Stevie Wonder!

1628
01:19:03,029 --> 01:19:05,365
Hi. Damian Marley, please.
Thank you.

1629
01:19:07,368 --> 01:19:10,454
Hey. Yeah.
I was just talking to Nas.

1630
01:19:10,579 --> 01:19:13,207
That's right.
What are you guys doing?

1631
01:19:13,498 --> 01:19:15,835
For take-off and landing,
I need everybody's seat belt on,

1632
01:19:15,960 --> 01:19:19,630
shoulder harness attached,
seats upright position,

1633
01:19:19,756 --> 01:19:24,176
tables stowed, items stowed,
electronic devices turned off and stowed.

1634
01:19:24,301 --> 01:19:26,179
Cabin's pressurized
for your comfort.

1635
01:19:26,304 --> 01:19:28,389
If there's a change of pressure,
masks will drop.

1636
01:19:28,514 --> 01:19:31,850
If they ever do drop, just pull
so that piece is engaged

1637
01:19:31,975 --> 01:19:34,479
and put that mask
over your nose and mouth.

1638
01:19:34,854 --> 01:19:37,648
Two fire extinguishers on board.
They're both up front.

1639
01:19:37,774 --> 01:19:39,649
One's behind the captain
on the bulkhead,

1640
01:19:39,775 --> 01:19:41,416
and the other's
by that main cabin door...

1641
01:19:41,527 --> 01:19:43,404
Which part's the bulkhead?

1642
01:19:43,654 --> 01:19:46,448
Okay. Thank you very much.
I introduced Nas. What's that?

1643
01:19:46,573 --> 01:19:48,493
Damian Marley. Okay.

1644
01:19:48,618 --> 01:19:51,703
I introduced them both.
I know Nas.

1645
01:19:51,828 --> 01:19:53,538
All right.
Thank you.

1646
01:19:53,663 --> 01:19:55,248
Nom, nom, nom.

1647
01:19:57,042 --> 01:19:58,752
Okay-

1648
01:19:59,377 --> 01:20:00,587
Oh, my God.

1649
01:20:00,712 --> 01:20:03,507
Oh, come on.
- I know Nas.

1650
01:20:03,632 --> 01:20:05,635
I introduced Damian Marley and Nas.

1651
01:20:06,135 --> 01:20:08,375
Hey, did you guys see me
introduce Damian Marley and Nas?

1652
01:20:09,387 --> 01:20:11,681
Gus, did you see that?
Hey, Jeff?

1653
01:20:11,807 --> 01:20:13,935
Did you know that I introduced
Damian Marley and Nas?

1654
01:20:14,060 --> 01:20:15,269
I did know.
- Okay.

1655
01:20:15,478 --> 01:20:17,104
Hey, Andy?
- What?

1656
01:20:17,229 --> 01:20:19,564
Did you know that I introduced
Damian Marley and Nas?

1657
01:20:19,689 --> 01:20:21,943
Yeah, I did. I heard that.
- Okay, cool.

1658
01:20:22,068 --> 01:20:24,403
That's awesome for you.

1659
01:20:24,529 --> 01:20:27,155
¶ I just can't wait to get
on the road again ¶

1660
01:20:28,240 --> 01:20:30,076
¶ Wa-ooh ¶

1661
01:20:30,827 --> 01:20:35,122
¶ The life I love
is making music with my friends ¶

1662

¶ I can't wait to get

01:20:41,837 --> 01:20:45,675
¶ I just can't wait to get
my own show again ¶

1665
01:20:45,800 --> 01:20:47,217
¶ Wa-ooh ¶

1666
01:20:47,342 --> 01:20:51,055
¶ I'd even take a crappy
primetime show at 10:00 ¶

1667
01:20:51,389 --> 01:20:53,140
¶ On the road again ¶

1668
01:20:53,265 --> 01:20:56,226

lights, and cameramen ¶

1669

¶ On the road again ¶

1670
01:20:57,770 --> 01:21:01,858
¶ 'Cause I'd really like
to talk to Megan Fox again ¶

1671
01:21:01,983 --> 01:21:04,318
¶ Megan Fox again ¶

1672
01:21:04,652 --> 01:21:06,695
Wow, there's a traffic jam.

1673
01:21:06,863 --> 01:21:08,864
We got to get out and walk.

1674
01:21:09,030 --> 01:21:10,615
I'm ready.

1675
01:21:12,784 --> 01:21:14,244
It's been a long day.

1676
01:21:14,412 --> 01:21:15,872
Oh, hi. Is this Nas?

1677
01:21:15,997 --> 01:21:17,582
Hey, it's Conan.

1678
01:21:17,707 --> 01:21:19,417
I'm cool.
- "I'm cool."

1679
01:21:19,542 --> 01:21:20,960
I'm glad you liked it.
- Dude, what'd he ask?

1680
01:21:21,085 --> 01:21:22,962
Are you cool or are you uncool?

1681
01:21:23,087 --> 01:21:26,298
So, Conan,
who's your hip-hop heroes?

1682
01:21:26,423 --> 01:21:28,341
Well, I guess it would be Nas.
- Yeah.

1683
01:21:28,466 --> 01:21:30,011
And if it was reggae,
it would be Damian Marley.

1684
01:21:30,136 --> 01:21:30,845
Yeah.

1685
01:21:30,970 --> 01:21:32,137
I should probably go pretty soon.

1686
01:21:32,262 --> 01:21:33,471
But anyway...
- All right.

1687
01:21:33,597 --> 01:21:35,349
Well, keep it hip-hop,
then, Conan.

1688
01:21:35,474 --> 01:21:37,154
Listen, I'll tell you
something, my friend.

1689
01:21:37,268 --> 01:21:39,895
A-rap-rap ribbety-rap,
a-rap-rap rabbity rat.

1690
01:21:40,020 --> 01:21:43,149
I said, rap-rap ribbety-rap, rap-rap.
I said, a-rap-rap ribbety-rap.

1691
01:21:43,274 --> 01:21:47,403
It's got to stop, you know, 'cause
it's... it's very Peter Pan, you know?

1692
01:21:47,612 --> 01:21:50,739
It's very, "I'll never grow up",
you know what I mean?

1693
01:21:50,907 --> 01:21:53,783
I'll just jump around
in the Eddie Murphy "Raw" suit forever.

1694
01:21:53,909 --> 01:21:58,163
This is the most satisfying thing
I've ever done in show business.

1695
01:21:58,372 --> 01:22:00,082
And I've been in show business
since 1985,

1696
01:22:00,207 --> 01:22:03,711
and this is the purest hit
of excitement and adrenaline

1697
01:22:03,836 --> 01:22:06,838
and everything that I love
about show business, but...

1698
01:22:09,675 --> 01:22:12,052
One can see the sickness of it, too.

1699
01:22:12,261 --> 01:22:16,097
If I was away all the time...
I mean, I haven't seen my kids in...

1700
01:22:16,222 --> 01:22:18,975
It's this weird problem
where I absolutely love this

1701
01:22:19,100 --> 01:22:21,895
and I also understand that
this needs to stop pretty soon.

1702
01:22:31,572 --> 01:22:33,323
¶ I pulled into Nazareth ¶

1703
01:22:33,448 --> 01:22:37,078
¶ I was feelin'
about half past dead ¶

1704
01:22:37,243 --> 01:22:39,037
¶ I just need someplace ¶

1705
01:22:39,162 --> 01:22:42,707
¶ Where I can lay my head ¶

1706
01:22:42,917 --> 01:22:46,921
¶ "Hey, mister, can you tell me
where a man might find a bed?" ¶

1707
01:22:48,797 --> 01:22:50,548
¶ He just grinned
and shook my hand ¶

1708
01:22:50,675 --> 01:22:52,926
¶ And "No" was all he said ¶

1709
01:22:54,511 --> 01:22:56,846
¶ Take a load off, Annie ¶

1710
01:22:57,264 --> 01:22:59,307
¶ Take a load for free ¶

1711
01:22:59,850 --> 01:23:02,060
¶ Take a load off, Annie ¶

1712
01:23:03,270 --> 01:23:05,355
¶ And ¶

1713
01:23:05,480 --> 01:23:08,192
¶ You put the load,
put the load right on me ¶

1714
01:23:08,484 --> 01:23:14,448
It's a really exhilarating, therapeutic, ecstatic,
crazy thing to do for any period of time.

1715
01:23:14,657 --> 01:23:16,417
There's, like, an elation
to this, you know,

1716
01:23:16,492 --> 01:23:19,203
which is coming out of
the utter despair of what happened.

1717
01:23:19,662 --> 01:23:21,037
Good night, everybody!

1718
01:23:26,543 --> 01:23:28,253
Congratulations.
- Yeah, you, too.

1719
01:23:28,378 --> 01:23:30,256
Thanks for doing this with me.
- Just doing what you love.

1720
01:23:30,381 --> 01:23:32,382
Thank you for asking me.
- Oh, Jesus Christ, are you kidding?

1721
01:23:32,507 --> 01:23:35,068
It's been the best... uh, the best
summer camp I've ever been to.

1722
01:23:35,176 --> 01:23:35,970
I know. It was crazy.

1723
01:23:36,095 --> 01:23:37,895
I don't know what this was
that just happened.

1724
01:23:37,971 --> 01:23:41,100
This is a special thing.
It's chocolate cake.

1725
01:23:41,225 --> 01:23:43,476
You don't want to make it
every meal, you know?

1726
01:23:43,601 --> 01:23:45,645
Hey, you eat chocolate cake every meal.

1727
01:23:47,148 --> 01:23:48,189
Yeah.

1728
01:23:48,440 --> 01:23:49,774
You did...
you did a great, great job.

1729
01:23:49,899 --> 01:23:50,900
So did you.

1730
01:23:51,027 --> 01:23:53,362
You did a great job.
You should be very proud.

1731
01:23:53,487 --> 01:23:56,614
You did great.
You really helped me.

1732
01:23:59,368 --> 01:24:01,328
See that? I'm crying.

1733
01:24:01,453 --> 01:24:03,872
Does it look like I'm crying?

1734
01:24:06,667 --> 01:24:11,588
My whole career has been
trying to get closer and closer and closer

1735
01:24:11,713 --> 01:24:14,507
to the real gritty core of show business.

1736
01:24:14,632 --> 01:24:17,353
You know, I used to have these gigs
where I was in a bungalow with...

1737
01:24:17,470 --> 01:24:18,887
thinking of concepts.

1738
01:24:19,012 --> 01:24:21,390
I kept thinking, "This isn't it, this
isn't it, this isn't it, this isn't it."

1739
01:24:21,599 --> 01:24:22,850
"Saturday Night Live"
felt much closer.

1740
01:24:22,975 --> 01:24:24,476
"The Late Night Show"
felt much closer

1741
01:24:24,601 --> 01:24:28,064
'cause there's people
in the hallway in horse costumes.

1742
01:24:32,943 --> 01:24:37,530
This thing... anyone who knows me
who watches this says,

1743
01:24:38,032 --> 01:24:41,786
"Now that's just raw you."

1744
01:24:47,707 --> 01:24:50,086
Whoo!

1745
01:24:53,546 --> 01:24:55,256
Conan!

1746
01:24:59,552 --> 01:25:03,099
I need to go home and, like, drive my kids
to school, do you know what I mean?

1747
01:25:05,935 --> 01:25:07,811
Or have my agent
drive them to school.

1748
01:25:29,416 --> 01:25:31,085
¶ Runnin' to-and-fro,
hard workin' at the mill ¶

1749

you can pay me next week, baby" ¶

1754
01:25:44,390 --> 01:25:48,018
¶ Too much monkey business,
