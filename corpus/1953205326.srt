1
00:01:17,446 --> 00:01:19,198
<i>Why am I in America?</i>

2
00:01:20,241 --> 00:01:21,659
<i>I already told you!</i>

3
00:01:22,952 --> 00:01:24,870
<i>For business!</i>

4
00:01:27,248 --> 00:01:33,671
<i>I'm here to get back my stolen</i>
<i>business item, you know?</i>

5
00:01:34,964 --> 00:01:37,675
13th on the charts!
7th on the album rankings!

6
00:01:37,758 --> 00:01:39,385
Hottest rising star!

7
00:01:39,468 --> 00:01:43,973
She's the rookie that's making
LEE Hyo-li retire, you asshole!

8
00:01:44,056 --> 00:01:47,310
Where's Mila?
Where the hell is she?

9
00:01:47,351 --> 00:01:49,895
Tell me where she is, you asshole!

10
00:01:57,194 --> 00:01:59,113
<i>I was close to getting it back.</i>

11
00:02:01,282 --> 00:02:03,826
<i>But I failed for health reasons.</i>

12
00:02:11,083 --> 00:02:14,545
<i>Then I fell in love.</i>

13
00:02:16,047 --> 00:02:20,968
<i>She was a ray of light</i>
<i>in the depth of my despair.</i>

14
00:02:23,054 --> 00:02:24,388
Let's get hitched.

15
00:02:28,351 --> 00:02:30,394
I'll give you five grand now and

16
00:02:30,478 --> 00:02:32,688
five more if we pass the immigrations.

17
00:02:34,732 --> 00:02:38,486
I don't know what you've heard
but that's nonsense.

18
00:02:40,071 --> 00:02:41,489
Oh, yeah?

19
00:02:41,572 --> 00:02:43,658
You got married five times because

20
00:02:43,741 --> 00:02:45,576
you fell in love with all of them?

21
00:02:46,577 --> 00:02:48,579
If it's the money...

22
00:02:48,663 --> 00:02:50,081
<i>We were crazy about each other.</i>

23
00:02:50,164 --> 00:02:54,502
Real or fake, I'll never
marry a punk like you.

24
00:02:55,169 --> 00:02:57,296
<i>We even broke up once...</i>

25
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:59,507
Damn it!

26
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:01,008
<i>...like other</i>
<i>ordinary couples</i> do.

27
00:03:02,885 --> 00:03:06,806
<i>The one who loves more gets hurt more.</i>

28
00:03:07,264 --> 00:03:08,808
Help me.

29
00:03:08,891 --> 00:03:11,894
I'm dead if I go back to Korea.

30
00:03:12,687 --> 00:03:15,231
They'll kill me if I go there!

31
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,650
Please help me.

32
00:03:18,109 --> 00:03:20,236
By the power vested in me,

33
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:23,864
in the sin city of Las Vegas, Nevada!

34
00:03:23,948 --> 00:03:27,284
I now pronounce you man and wife.

35
00:03:27,326 --> 00:03:29,870
<i>Marriage was a beginning of our life.</i>

36
00:03:29,954 --> 00:03:31,080
Stick in your tongue, I'll kill you.

37
00:03:31,122 --> 00:03:34,375
You too, Ms. Lee!

38
00:03:34,458 --> 00:03:38,295
Use the tongue, please!
Deeper, deeper!

39
00:03:39,547 --> 00:03:42,675
<i>We talked about</i>
<i>a lot of things coming back.</i>

40
00:03:42,758 --> 00:03:47,179
Hey, lady! What are you
doing with your life?

41
00:03:47,263 --> 00:03:48,764
<i>About our future.</i>

42
00:03:49,473 --> 00:03:52,893
Don't ever run into me when we're done.

43
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:56,689
<i>Everything seemed perfect.</i>

44
00:04:01,777 --> 00:04:04,613
Why the hell is she in such a hurry?

45
00:04:31,348 --> 00:04:36,771
<i>PAPA</i>

46
00:04:52,745 --> 00:04:55,289
<i>I should've never met her.</i>

47
00:04:57,541 --> 00:05:03,798
Even if I did, I wish that I loved her

48
00:05:06,258 --> 00:05:10,221
Just the right amount.

49
00:05:10,262 --> 00:05:12,389
Agent Park. What is he saying?

50
00:05:14,058 --> 00:05:17,645
He's saying uh...
That he didn't...

51
00:05:17,728 --> 00:05:19,146
...want to love her...

52
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:29,949
I know you're suspicious.

53
00:05:31,408 --> 00:05:35,454
Even I never believed in love like this.

54
00:05:35,538 --> 00:05:37,665
I'll never be able to love again.

55
00:05:38,749 --> 00:05:41,585
It's as if I've seen the sun and

56
00:05:41,627 --> 00:05:43,587
now I have become blind and disabled.

57
00:05:43,629 --> 00:05:45,172
Disabled in love.

58
00:05:50,261 --> 00:05:52,096
Having seen the sun,

59
00:05:53,764 --> 00:05:58,477
He has a disability in love.

60
00:06:00,771 --> 00:06:04,191
Is he translating me right?

61
00:06:04,275 --> 00:06:05,985
Thank you ma'am.

62
00:06:07,152 --> 00:06:09,780
And what is this disability in love?

63
00:06:09,864 --> 00:06:12,700
Sir, I think it might be an
Asian expression for...

64
00:06:13,367 --> 00:06:15,119
...impotent.
- Oh.

65
00:06:27,423 --> 00:06:30,134
We got an Asian male who marries a woman

66
00:06:30,217 --> 00:06:32,553
ten years older than
he is as soon as they meet

67
00:06:32,636 --> 00:06:34,138
which just happens to be a few days

68
00:06:34,221 --> 00:06:35,848
before his visa is to expire.

69
00:06:35,931 --> 00:06:36,849
Right.

70
00:06:38,225 --> 00:06:40,769
He doesn't have a particular
place of residence either.

71
00:06:40,811 --> 00:06:41,937
Exactly!

72
00:06:42,021 --> 00:06:43,564
I need you to get a deportation date on him

73
00:06:43,647 --> 00:06:45,065
as quickly as possible.

74
00:06:45,149 --> 00:06:48,152
And he just might try to run away so...

75
00:06:48,444 --> 00:06:50,863
contact the local police so they
can help to keep an eye on him.

76
00:06:50,946 --> 00:06:52,948
- Yes, sir.
- Papa!

77
00:06:56,952 --> 00:06:58,078
Papa!

78
00:06:59,663 --> 00:07:01,498
I missed you, papa!

79
00:07:13,677 --> 00:07:16,931
I'm off the hook!
What a great turn out!

80
00:07:17,306 --> 00:07:19,433
This is the way it should be!

81
00:07:19,516 --> 00:07:21,018
Children need a guardian!

82
00:07:21,101 --> 00:07:23,520
This is cool!
The three of us!

83
00:07:25,189 --> 00:07:26,732
What a great singer!

84
00:07:26,815 --> 00:07:30,152
You happy? I'm happy!
Everybody's happy!

85
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:42,665
We're here?

86
00:07:43,832 --> 00:07:46,460
Up the stairs to the bathroom!

87
00:07:46,543 --> 00:07:48,462
I gotta pee!

88
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:10,484
- Dude, it's not Rosie.
- Who is it?

89
00:08:14,238 --> 00:08:15,072
Oh, my.

90
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:16,782
- Oh my gosh.
- We are dead.

91
00:08:16,907 --> 00:08:18,908
<i>Even today we'd faced her scoldin'</i>

92
00:08:18,909 --> 00:08:20,327
<i>and there's no reason!</i>

93
00:08:20,411 --> 00:08:22,538
<i>Didn't even put that Rosie to cryin'</i>

94
00:08:22,579 --> 00:08:24,623
<i>Or even any broken window!</i>

95
00:08:24,707 --> 00:08:25,916
<i>All the cause of this!</i>

96
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,752
<i>The fool visiting this</i>
<i>hell on Halloween Day!</i>

97
00:08:28,794 --> 00:08:29,753
<i>You don't know MIC!</i>

98
00:08:29,795 --> 00:08:32,548
<i>The fool coming without</i>
<i>knowing any hip to the hop!</i>

99
00:08:32,589 --> 00:08:35,050
<i>You're an ugly gift!</i>
<i>Sent from the down and under!</i>

100
00:08:35,092 --> 00:08:37,428
<i>An ugly gift looking strange to the shady!</i>

101
00:08:37,511 --> 00:08:40,347
<i>We'll keep our eyes on you, ugly!</i>

102
00:08:57,948 --> 00:08:59,283
I got it!

103
00:09:12,046 --> 00:09:13,297
You go that way!

104
00:09:15,799 --> 00:09:18,510
Good morning, ugly!

105
00:09:18,594 --> 00:09:20,512
You're looking nice as usual!

106
00:09:20,596 --> 00:09:21,722
Not!

107
00:09:25,893 --> 00:09:27,519
This...

108
00:09:27,686 --> 00:09:33,025
This colorful multinational
troop of kids is your mother's?

109
00:09:33,984 --> 00:09:35,319
Except for you.

110
00:09:35,402 --> 00:09:37,446
They're all her ex-husbands',

111
00:09:37,488 --> 00:09:41,450
and now I have to raise
them to get my visa.

112
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:52,044
Be patient.
Be patient.

113
00:09:53,504 --> 00:09:54,963
Let's make this easy.

114
00:09:55,005 --> 00:09:59,968
We just gotta pretend to be
a family when we need to.

115
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:04,056
I'll just leave quietly
when my business is done.

116
00:10:04,139 --> 00:10:07,142
There's nothing to this.
You just obey me.

117
00:10:07,226 --> 00:10:09,561
Just think of me as god.

118
00:10:09,645 --> 00:10:10,270
<i>Kick Me!</i>

119
00:10:10,354 --> 00:10:12,856
Then I'll keep the family peace.

120
00:10:13,941 --> 00:10:17,361
First of all, I never wake up before 11 am.

121
00:10:17,444 --> 00:10:19,363
So what should you do?

122
00:10:19,446 --> 00:10:21,365
Just keep shut till then.

123
00:10:21,448 --> 00:10:22,991
Shut up!

124
00:10:34,378 --> 00:10:35,796
You pay for living expenses and rent.

125
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:38,215
You pay 70, we pay 30.

126
00:10:38,298 --> 00:10:40,843
Give me your resume by tomorrow.

127
00:10:40,884 --> 00:10:41,844
I'll get you a job.

128
00:10:41,885 --> 00:10:42,719
What?

129
00:10:42,761 --> 00:10:45,305
Immigrations will be asking about you.

130
00:10:45,389 --> 00:10:47,307
Don't forget I can always charge you

131
00:10:47,391 --> 00:10:49,393
for child abuse or sexual abuse.

132
00:10:49,476 --> 00:10:52,396
If anything happens to us

133
00:10:52,479 --> 00:10:54,523
I'll kill you.

134
00:10:56,191 --> 00:10:59,903
You know you're my mom's sixth husband?

135
00:10:59,987 --> 00:11:03,407
I'm an adult next year.
Don't you fool with me.

136
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:05,242
- I never...
- Any questions?

137
00:11:05,284 --> 00:11:07,619
- I...
- Share Gordon's room.

138
00:11:07,703 --> 00:11:08,829
Hey!

139
00:11:09,288 --> 00:11:11,915
Hey! Jimmy, Tommy!
I told you to stop!

140
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:12,916
Take it off!

141
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,460
You got scissors for a tongue?

142
00:11:15,544 --> 00:11:19,548
How dare you cut me off?
I'm trying to speak, here.

143
00:11:20,424 --> 00:11:24,678
You don't know nothing!

144
00:11:24,761 --> 00:11:28,473
You'd be in orphanage without me.

145
00:11:28,557 --> 00:11:30,184
How dare you threaten me?

146
00:11:32,352 --> 00:11:34,771
You'd be deported with a phone call.

147
00:11:36,148 --> 00:11:38,984
You're not minding
your manners, young lady!

148
00:11:39,067 --> 00:11:42,905
Is it so hard to respect your elders?

149
00:11:42,946 --> 00:11:44,990
Oh, yeah!
This is America!

150
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:49,786
Your name's June? Yo!

151
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:52,206
June, like the month?

152
00:11:52,289 --> 00:11:54,124
It's nice and simple.

153
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:56,210
Catchy name, like a geisha!

154
00:11:56,293 --> 00:11:58,212
Why do I have to work for you guys?

155
00:11:58,295 --> 00:12:01,215
Look after Rosie till you get a job.

156
00:12:01,298 --> 00:12:02,716
Who's Rosie?

157
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:04,927
This one?
The squeaky one?

158
00:12:04,968 --> 00:12:06,303
Want me to babysit?

159
00:12:07,095 --> 00:12:10,307
Don't you have any Korean soup?
I'm totally craving it.

160
00:12:11,475 --> 00:12:14,645
I don't think you know me very well.

161
00:12:14,728 --> 00:12:16,855
So let me give you a warning.

162
00:12:16,939 --> 00:12:21,276
There's a lot behind this
friendly looking face.

163
00:12:21,318 --> 00:12:23,278
Hey!

164
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:26,073
You glaring at me?

165
00:12:27,032 --> 00:12:28,867
You wanna see what I really am?

166
00:12:28,951 --> 00:12:30,953
You'd regret being born

167
00:12:31,036 --> 00:12:35,165
and meeting someone as nasty as me.

168
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:37,876
Mind your manners!

169
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,962
Say good morning!

170
00:12:40,045 --> 00:12:43,090
You'll see what hell's like.

171
00:12:43,173 --> 00:12:46,093
You know what hell's like?
You can't go there alive.

172
00:12:46,176 --> 00:12:50,180
I'll send you... there...
what the hell?

173
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:55,310
The hot taste of hell...

174
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:58,397
what the hell?

175
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,315
Yes! See!
I told you!

176
00:13:00,357 --> 00:13:02,484
I told you food from your world

177
00:13:02,567 --> 00:13:04,528
could be used as lethal weapon, loser!

178
00:13:04,569 --> 00:13:06,196
- Kiss my ass!
- Whatever! Ha!

179
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,906
Don't say that.

180
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:09,825
- Stop it!
- No! Stop!

181
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:18,166
I'll kill you god damn pricks!

182
00:13:25,048 --> 00:13:26,383
- Hi.
- Hello.

183
00:13:26,425 --> 00:13:28,051
Who are you?

184
00:13:28,719 --> 00:13:31,263
Well, I'm Miss Phoebe.
Who are you?

185
00:13:37,561 --> 00:13:39,688
What do child welfare workers do?

186
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:40,939
Just shut up and smile.

187
00:13:44,151 --> 00:13:47,988
You two look very close.

188
00:13:48,447 --> 00:13:51,199
Yeah. They can't live
without each other.

189
00:13:52,951 --> 00:13:55,495
Yeah!
Absolutely sure!

190
00:13:55,579 --> 00:13:57,289
Nod your head!

191
00:13:57,372 --> 00:13:59,207
Do you help out around the house?

192
00:13:59,249 --> 00:14:00,584
What do you do at home?

193
00:14:00,667 --> 00:14:03,003
Do you have work chores?

194
00:14:03,086 --> 00:14:04,421
You do any chores?

195
00:14:04,463 --> 00:14:06,715
Laundry!
I do the laundry!

196
00:14:08,091 --> 00:14:12,095
Yeah!
He does the laundry.

197
00:14:12,179 --> 00:14:13,805
Chun-seob

198
00:14:13,889 --> 00:14:15,640
Are there things in your mind

199
00:14:15,724 --> 00:14:17,851
that you wish to do for the children?

200
00:14:17,934 --> 00:14:19,561
Things you'd like to do for us.

201
00:14:19,603 --> 00:14:22,064
Say whatever.
I'll make it up.

202
00:14:23,607 --> 00:14:25,650
Actually

203
00:14:25,734 --> 00:14:29,654
I've always dreamt of having a family.

204
00:14:29,738 --> 00:14:32,574
This is what I've always wanted.

205
00:14:32,616 --> 00:14:36,161
First for young Rosie

206
00:14:36,244 --> 00:14:43,168
I would like to read her
a fairytale every night

207
00:14:43,251 --> 00:14:44,586
Yeah!

208
00:14:44,628 --> 00:14:50,384
And the twin brats...

209
00:14:50,467 --> 00:14:54,304
I mean Jimmy and Tommy, play
a game of catch perhaps?

210
00:14:54,346 --> 00:14:56,306
As a papa, it's a given!

211
00:14:59,142 --> 00:15:03,480
And my oldest son Gordon

212
00:15:03,563 --> 00:15:05,690
As he'll be an adult soon,

213
00:15:05,774 --> 00:15:08,985
I'd like to teach him Korean drinking.

214
00:15:10,862 --> 00:15:12,906
What? Drinking?

215
00:15:12,989 --> 00:15:14,616
Yeah, teach him to drink alcohol.

216
00:15:14,699 --> 00:15:16,326
You're gonna teach him to get drunk?

217
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:18,245
Shouldn't you be smiling?

218
00:15:22,416 --> 00:15:23,667
I'm happy!

219
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:30,632
- Bye!
- I love you!

220
00:15:37,431 --> 00:15:38,473
Don't come back!

221
00:15:38,515 --> 00:15:40,267
Or I'm gonna hit you with a sack!

222
00:15:47,149 --> 00:15:49,067
Do you really think this is a good idea?

223
00:15:49,151 --> 00:15:51,570
Living together like this without a plan?

224
00:15:55,449 --> 00:15:57,200
Everything stays the same.

225
00:15:57,742 --> 00:16:00,370
It just got a little more
difficult than before.

226
00:16:00,454 --> 00:16:02,372
We just continue living like we have.

227
00:16:03,957 --> 00:16:05,375
Whatever.

228
00:16:18,805 --> 00:16:20,557
I don't care!

229
00:16:20,599 --> 00:16:24,227
Just tell that asshole
Mr. Dough I'll pay him back

230
00:16:24,311 --> 00:16:27,230
when I find Mila and put her back to work.

231
00:16:27,314 --> 00:16:31,651
What? Mr. Dough got me
on the wanted list?

232
00:16:34,029 --> 00:16:36,656
Tell him I found her.
Tell him she's next to me.

233
00:16:37,908 --> 00:16:39,659
Of course it's a lie!

234
00:16:39,743 --> 00:16:40,744
I'd be in Korea if I found her!

235
00:16:40,827 --> 00:16:43,246
Get your words right!

236
00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:45,665
Hello? JANG?

237
00:16:59,054 --> 00:17:01,556
What?
Twenty grand?

238
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:02,599
Yeah.

239
00:17:02,641 --> 00:17:04,601
It's illegal to park the car on the highway

240
00:17:04,643 --> 00:17:06,770
and the driver got hurt bad.

241
00:17:06,853 --> 00:17:09,189
They said we're lucky
it's not more than that.

242
00:17:09,272 --> 00:17:13,193
Lucky?
Look, June!

243
00:17:13,276 --> 00:17:14,903
I should be the one getting compensated.

244
00:17:14,986 --> 00:17:16,947
My life is screwed
because of that accident!

245
00:17:16,988 --> 00:17:20,033
- They'll take the house!
- What about me, then?

246
00:17:20,116 --> 00:17:21,952
What about me?

247
00:17:21,993 --> 00:17:25,247
You pay ten grand.
You're partly responsible.

248
00:17:25,288 --> 00:17:27,832
Why am I partly responsible?

249
00:17:27,916 --> 00:17:30,544
Your mom parked the car on the road
and told me to piss outside

250
00:17:30,627 --> 00:17:34,047
I'm the victim here!

251
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:35,757
You'd deported without us.

252
00:17:35,799 --> 00:17:37,259
Why would I be?

253
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:39,427
The hell with this unfair country!

254
00:17:39,511 --> 00:17:42,264
Diner over there is hiring.
Show up when I call.

255
00:17:43,431 --> 00:17:45,767
You want me
to flip patties? Hey!

256
00:17:47,018 --> 00:17:49,354
I gotta find
that asshole Yang-moo.

257
00:17:49,938 --> 00:17:53,066
Yang-moo, you asshole!

258
00:18:00,156 --> 00:18:02,576
Hey! Fire! Fire!

259
00:18:29,311 --> 00:18:31,521
Bro! I'm sorry!

260
00:18:31,605 --> 00:18:35,650
I won't hit you.
Where's Mila?

261
00:18:35,692 --> 00:18:37,027
Where the hell is she?

262
00:18:41,197 --> 00:18:42,657
Mila?

263
00:18:45,035 --> 00:18:47,037
I'm sorry, bro.

264
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:49,748
Mila?

265
00:18:54,711 --> 00:18:56,546
Don't be sorry!

266
00:18:56,630 --> 00:18:59,674
Mr. Dough
will kill me anyway.

267
00:18:59,716 --> 00:19:01,760
So let's get pissed.

268
00:19:03,345 --> 00:19:06,264
This will be
a mouth-to-mouth shot!

269
00:19:11,728 --> 00:19:17,025
What do I do now,
Yang-moo?

270
00:19:19,486 --> 00:19:21,738
What do I do here?

271
00:19:23,698 --> 00:19:26,534
I'm sorry, bro.

272
00:19:37,003 --> 00:19:40,048
- What is he doing?
- I don't know.

273
00:19:58,733 --> 00:20:00,235
When we would isolate ourselves

274
00:20:00,318 --> 00:20:02,570
from the cries of your people

275
00:20:02,612 --> 00:20:06,366
Companion us into the world
that you so love.

276
00:20:06,449 --> 00:20:10,578
Oh God who hears all prayers
spoken and unspoken

277
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:14,457
we make this prayer in the name
of our lord Jesus Christ.

278
00:20:14,541 --> 00:20:17,669
Amen.
You may be seated.

279
00:20:21,965 --> 00:20:24,092
Today, our beloved member, June

280
00:20:24,134 --> 00:20:28,596
will once again share with us
her extraordinary gift, her voice.

281
00:20:28,638 --> 00:20:30,765
When does this end?

282
00:20:32,142 --> 00:20:35,770
When this stop?
Damn English!

283
00:20:35,854 --> 00:20:39,399
In a little bit, June is going to sing.

284
00:20:39,858 --> 00:20:43,987
When June sings, everybody becomes happy.

285
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:46,614
You'll become happy too, papa.

286
00:20:47,365 --> 00:20:52,412
It's a secret, but mom said
she will be a star.

287
00:20:52,495 --> 00:20:55,331
I wanna be like June when I grow up.

288
00:20:56,082 --> 00:20:58,334
Do you think that's possible?

289
00:20:58,376 --> 00:21:02,005
All I asked was a simple question.

290
00:21:02,088 --> 00:21:05,508
- Okay, good.
- Thank you, papa!

291
00:21:26,446 --> 00:21:27,989
Help me, God.

292
00:21:32,744 --> 00:21:37,999
<i>Oh Lord you've searched me</i>

293
00:21:39,751 --> 00:21:44,798
<i>You know my way</i>

294
00:21:46,257 --> 00:21:51,721
<i>Even when I fail you</i>

295
00:21:52,764 --> 00:21:58,520
<i>I know you love me</i>

296
00:21:59,479 --> 00:22:05,527
<i>I know you love me</i>

297
00:22:07,195 --> 00:22:10,532
<i>At the cross I bow my knee</i>

298
00:22:10,573 --> 00:22:14,035
<i>where your blood was shed for me</i>

299
00:22:14,077 --> 00:22:18,164
<i>There's a greater love than this</i>

300
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:23,962
<i>You have overcome the grave</i>

301
00:22:24,045 --> 00:22:27,674
<i>Glory fills the highest place</i>

302
00:22:27,757 --> 00:22:31,970
<i>One can't separate me now</i>

303
00:22:32,053 --> 00:22:35,473
<i>You tore the veil</i>

304
00:22:35,557 --> 00:22:39,269
<i>You made a way</i>

305
00:22:39,352 --> 00:22:45,608
<i>When you said that it is done</i>

306
00:22:45,650 --> 00:22:48,987
<i>You tore the veil</i>

307
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:51,698
<i>You made a way</i>

308
00:22:52,949 --> 00:22:59,414
<i>When you said that it is done</i>

309
00:23:01,666 --> 00:23:08,506
<i>All is done, All is done</i>

310
00:23:10,967 --> 00:23:14,762
<i>By your glory, is done</i>

311
00:23:31,029 --> 00:23:34,282
<i>We praise you</i>

312
00:23:46,836 --> 00:23:49,964
Praise the Lord!

313
00:23:55,762 --> 00:23:58,097
Get out!

314
00:23:58,181 --> 00:24:00,308
Get outta here!

315
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:02,810
Okay! Yay!

316
00:24:04,479 --> 00:24:08,900
Why do they wear shoes in the house?

317
00:24:18,201 --> 00:24:20,328
All this cleaning and laundry!

318
00:24:21,829 --> 00:24:25,249
The laundry's done but
I don't know what belongs to who.

319
00:24:25,333 --> 00:24:29,045
How sad to see children
grow up in a slum like this.

320
00:24:29,128 --> 00:24:33,049
I even cleaned the bathroom with bleach.

321
00:24:34,133 --> 00:24:35,760
Good, good.

322
00:24:52,068 --> 00:24:54,779
Try as a singer.

323
00:24:56,948 --> 00:25:00,785
I never told you but
I think it's time you know.

324
00:25:00,868 --> 00:25:02,495
I, uh...

325
00:25:02,578 --> 00:25:07,291
I have the Minus... or the Midas
Touch in Korean music world.

326
00:25:08,376 --> 00:25:12,088
I myself have produced countless stars.

327
00:25:12,171 --> 00:25:15,925
I guarantee you as
a former manager. You're it.

328
00:25:16,009 --> 00:25:19,762
Your voice level, tone, range, lung power...

329
00:25:19,804 --> 00:25:21,139
- Just change the attitude.
- No.

330
00:25:21,222 --> 00:25:22,640
Don't change it.

331
00:25:22,724 --> 00:25:25,935
It's not Obama who changes the world.

332
00:25:26,019 --> 00:25:27,353
It's Oprah!

333
00:25:27,437 --> 00:25:29,564
You know Oprah, right?
Popularity is power!

334
00:25:29,605 --> 00:25:32,442
You know how much the most popular singer

335
00:25:32,525 --> 00:25:33,943
in Korea made last year?

336
00:25:34,027 --> 00:25:36,571
15 million dollars.

337
00:25:36,612 --> 00:25:39,073
There's this one I produced.

338
00:25:39,115 --> 00:25:41,868
Her grandma was sick
and her mom was a janitor.

339
00:25:41,951 --> 00:25:44,454
She worked for her family of five.

340
00:25:44,537 --> 00:25:47,373
She bought a huge house
two years after her debut.

341
00:25:47,457 --> 00:25:50,084
You know how much it was?

342
00:25:50,126 --> 00:25:51,878
So if I sing, I make money?

343
00:25:51,961 --> 00:25:52,378
Bingo!

344
00:25:52,462 --> 00:25:53,796
- Fine, then!
- Yes!

345
00:25:53,838 --> 00:25:55,882
Then show me the two grand first.

346
00:25:57,550 --> 00:26:01,596
- Sell your house.
- It's a rental.

347
00:26:01,637 --> 00:26:06,267
We need the basic fund to get started.

348
00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:08,478
An audition would be the best way.

349
00:26:08,561 --> 00:26:10,480
I need that money.

350
00:26:10,563 --> 00:26:11,397
Audition, audition...

351
00:26:11,481 --> 00:26:14,525
<i>This is the audition</i>
<i>you have been looking for!</i>

352
00:26:14,609 --> 00:26:15,735
What?

353
00:26:18,321 --> 00:26:21,449
<i>The major record labels are</i>
<i>searching for the next</i>

354
00:26:21,491 --> 00:26:22,742
<i>multi-million dollar</i>
<i>contract artists!</i>

355
00:26:23,284 --> 00:26:24,952
Hey! Don't look!

356
00:26:25,703 --> 00:26:29,040
Super Star K is in the summer.

357
00:26:29,123 --> 00:26:31,459
When is American Idol?

358
00:26:32,418 --> 00:26:35,171
<i>And the first place winner</i>
<i>will receive 30,000 dollars!</i>

359
00:26:35,213 --> 00:26:38,174
Is he deaf? Turn it down!

360
00:26:40,343 --> 00:26:44,472
<i>This year's WE Audition is back!</i>

361
00:26:44,514 --> 00:26:47,475
- Is this an audition?
- Yes.

362
00:26:49,519 --> 00:26:52,563
- How much is the prize?
- It's <i>thirty</i> thousand dollars.

363
00:26:52,647 --> 00:26:54,357
- <i>Thirty...</i>
- <i>Thirty</i> thousand.

364
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:57,693
<i>Thirty</i> thousand?

365
00:26:58,236 --> 00:27:00,988
<i>Thirty</i> thousand dollars!
Where's this audition?

366
00:27:01,030 --> 00:27:01,989
It's at Atlanta...

367
00:27:02,031 --> 00:27:03,658
- A... a...
- Atlanta.

368
00:27:03,741 --> 00:27:04,992
- Atlanta!
- Yes!

369
00:27:05,034 --> 00:27:07,870
I know Atlanta!
I've seen Gone with the wind.

370
00:27:10,373 --> 00:27:12,500
Does he speak Korean?

371
00:27:12,542 --> 00:27:13,292
No.

372
00:27:13,376 --> 00:27:16,337
Right,
that's impossible. Huh?

373
00:27:18,381 --> 00:27:22,426
I don't speak Korean.
Really.

374
00:27:23,010 --> 00:27:26,514
Then are you speaking Chinese?

375
00:27:27,098 --> 00:27:29,350
What a cunning bastard.

376
00:27:29,392 --> 00:27:32,228
Where'd you learn Korean?
From your mom?

377
00:27:32,311 --> 00:27:36,566
No. From Janggeum.

378
00:27:36,607 --> 00:27:39,443
From the TV drama Daejanggeum?

379
00:27:39,527 --> 00:27:42,155
It was so good.
I saw it many times.

380
00:27:42,238 --> 00:27:45,366
Really? Yay!
Good for Janggeum!

381
00:27:45,408 --> 00:27:47,160
When's the deadline for this audition?

382
00:27:47,243 --> 00:27:49,453
June will never audition.

383
00:27:49,537 --> 00:27:52,665
- How do you know?
- <i>Cuz</i> of mama.

384
00:27:52,748 --> 00:27:56,586
She auditioned a lot.

385
00:27:56,627 --> 00:28:03,627
June fought a lot with mama
<i>cuz</i> she was never home.

386
00:28:07,930 --> 00:28:10,183
Then I'll make her audition.

387
00:28:13,644 --> 00:28:16,314
Hammer in the notion of the orphanage.

388
00:28:16,397 --> 00:28:18,232
Tell Rosie she'll have to go to orphanage

389
00:28:18,274 --> 00:28:20,026
if June doesn't audition.

390
00:28:20,985 --> 00:28:23,946
Then she won't have her
teddy bear or squeaky shoes.

391
00:28:23,988 --> 00:28:26,616
We'll all be separated.
All of us.

392
00:28:30,286 --> 00:28:31,537
Start talking.

393
00:28:31,621 --> 00:28:34,123
Hey guys, what if we show
Rosie Oliver Twist?

394
00:28:34,207 --> 00:28:39,128
What if we show Rosie Oliver Twist?

395
00:28:39,212 --> 00:28:41,547
- What is that?
- A movie.

396
00:28:41,631 --> 00:28:47,136
The orphanage warden hits
the kids and gets them to steal.

397
00:28:48,137 --> 00:28:51,140
Nice strategy, guys!
What a good point!

398
00:28:52,516 --> 00:28:53,351
Translate the point only.

399
00:28:53,434 --> 00:28:59,565
But if we make Rosie cry June will kill us.

400
00:28:59,649 --> 00:29:01,150
Aren't you scared of June?

401
00:29:01,234 --> 00:29:03,945
You scared of a girl?
What a sissy!

402
00:29:04,028 --> 00:29:06,072
And don't you call me ya'!

403
00:29:06,155 --> 00:29:08,574
Then what should I call you?

404
00:29:09,659 --> 00:29:11,494
Your Highness.

405
00:29:11,535 --> 00:29:13,079
- Your... Highness.
- Your Highness.

406
00:29:13,162 --> 00:29:14,789
- Your Highness?
- Good.

407
00:29:15,289 --> 00:29:19,126
Put your hands together.
Like this!

408
00:29:19,168 --> 00:29:20,920
For Rosie, Rosie, Rosie!

409
00:29:21,003 --> 00:29:23,339
One, two, three!

410
00:29:25,091 --> 00:29:26,509
No!

411
00:29:32,598 --> 00:29:35,434
How can you say that to a child?

412
00:29:35,518 --> 00:29:37,019
It's not a big deal.

413
00:29:37,103 --> 00:29:39,730
You don't think orphanage is
a big deal to us?

414
00:29:39,814 --> 00:29:41,315
I mean...

415
00:29:41,399 --> 00:29:43,442
But this audition is our perfect chance.

416
00:29:43,526 --> 00:29:46,654
Audition?
Who says I'll audition?

417
00:29:46,696 --> 00:29:50,449
Come on!
You need the money, too!

418
00:29:50,533 --> 00:29:53,953
The <i>prize</i> is <i>thirty</i> grand!
We can pay the twenty grand fine

419
00:29:54,036 --> 00:29:55,871
and split the remaining ten grand.

420
00:29:55,913 --> 00:29:57,748
- What if I lose?
- You won't. I guarantee.

421
00:29:59,041 --> 00:30:00,459
I mean even if you lose,

422
00:30:00,543 --> 00:30:02,545
couldn't you just try it out?

423
00:30:02,628 --> 00:30:05,047
It's such a waste of talent!

424
00:30:05,131 --> 00:30:07,967
You're saying we'll be rich if I win?

425
00:30:08,050 --> 00:30:08,759
Naturally!

426
00:30:08,843 --> 00:30:11,262
And that no one will
look down on us if I win.

427
00:30:11,345 --> 00:30:14,849
So we should get more
loans for the audition?

428
00:30:14,932 --> 00:30:16,684
That's what mom always said.

429
00:30:17,852 --> 00:30:19,979
She doesn't even compare to you.

430
00:30:20,062 --> 00:30:21,397
You guys listen up.

431
00:30:22,231 --> 00:30:25,067
I'm not entering any audition.

432
00:30:25,151 --> 00:30:28,404
I'm gonna do my best and
as much as I possibly can.

433
00:30:28,446 --> 00:30:30,072
But, I'm not floundering in a daydream

434
00:30:30,156 --> 00:30:32,491
with whatever the talent I supposedly have.

435
00:30:32,575 --> 00:30:37,705
One fool is already enough
in this house for that!

436
00:30:37,747 --> 00:30:40,499
- You're not doing your best.
- What?

437
00:30:43,669 --> 00:30:47,006
You didn't see what I did?
I've done everything I could.

438
00:30:47,089 --> 00:30:50,092
Even brought someone
like that into the house!

439
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:53,220
You're not doing as much as you can.

440
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:56,223
You're doing as much as you please.

441
00:30:57,266 --> 00:30:59,518
Isn't that right?
Like it matters.

442
00:31:19,538 --> 00:31:21,290
What the heck was that?

443
00:31:33,135 --> 00:31:39,683
So... does our
sweet Rosie know...

444
00:31:39,767 --> 00:31:41,685
what an orphanage is?

445
00:31:44,563 --> 00:31:45,773
Rosie.

446
00:31:47,483 --> 00:31:51,987
If you go to there,
you might meet a nice family.

447
00:31:52,988 --> 00:31:55,825
You might meet another mommy

448
00:31:55,866 --> 00:31:57,993
who will always be with you

449
00:31:58,661 --> 00:32:01,705
or a sister who will teach you ballet

450
00:32:01,789 --> 00:32:03,916
since Rosie loves to dance.

451
00:32:04,583 --> 00:32:08,212
A home with everyone in same color as Rosie

452
00:32:08,295 --> 00:32:11,132
so people would think it's a real family.

453
00:32:13,092 --> 00:32:15,052
Don't you want a family like that?

454
00:32:15,136 --> 00:32:17,638
Uh-huh, I do.

455
00:32:22,143 --> 00:32:23,561
Then why do you hate it so much?

456
00:32:23,644 --> 00:32:27,273
Because you can't change your family.

457
00:32:28,232 --> 00:32:33,487
June, Maya, Gordon

458
00:32:34,029 --> 00:32:38,868
Jimmy, and Tommy...
That's Rosie's family.

459
00:32:39,743 --> 00:32:41,370
We're real.

460
00:32:59,388 --> 00:33:00,806
That's okay.

461
00:33:24,038 --> 00:33:25,372
In all honesty

462
00:33:29,835 --> 00:33:31,587
I don't like you being here.

463
00:33:42,139 --> 00:33:43,766
It always seems that...

464
00:33:46,602 --> 00:33:48,854
...there's hope when
I'm about to give up.

465
00:33:50,773 --> 00:33:54,193
Like now.
Like you.

466
00:33:54,276 --> 00:33:58,614
I'm so sleepy I don't know
what you're saying.

467
00:33:58,656 --> 00:34:02,993
You really think that I can do it?

468
00:34:08,582 --> 00:34:09,416
How about the expenses?

469
00:34:09,458 --> 00:34:11,293
Don't worry. I... I...

470
00:34:12,169 --> 00:34:14,547
I'll pay for everything.
Everything in first class!

471
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:17,550
- The kids will all come too.
- Of course.

472
00:34:17,633 --> 00:34:19,260
I'll audition.

473
00:34:21,804 --> 00:34:23,347
That doesn't mean I'll become a singer.

474
00:35:03,178 --> 00:35:05,306
<i>Heading to hip hop city</i>

475
00:35:05,347 --> 00:35:07,391
<i>and our souls are being ripped apart.</i>

476
00:35:07,975 --> 00:35:10,394
<i>No plane, no luxury camper.</i>

477
00:35:10,477 --> 00:35:13,606
<i>Just the shame of arriving in a crappy car.</i>

478
00:35:13,689 --> 00:35:16,734
<i>Trusting in that ugly gift from the devil</i>

479
00:35:16,817 --> 00:35:18,527
<i>that be our mistake!</i>

480
00:35:18,611 --> 00:35:19,945
<i>All our problems started</i>

481
00:35:20,029 --> 00:35:22,531
<i>when that ugly gift</i>
<i>appeared on Halloween day!</i>

482
00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:29,747
I'm driving here!
Hey!

483
00:35:39,214 --> 00:35:40,966
Look at that!

484
00:35:41,050 --> 00:35:46,388
Oh my!
It's amazing! Gordon!

485
00:35:47,222 --> 00:35:48,265
Oh my god! Look at that!

486
00:35:48,349 --> 00:35:50,059
If <i>we don't escape to Harlem,</i>

487
00:35:50,142 --> 00:35:52,061
<i>it's all because of</i>
<i>that ugly gift from the devil!</i>

488
00:35:52,144 --> 00:35:54,271
<i>We just poor rappers but to the end.</i>

489
00:35:54,355 --> 00:35:57,191
<i>We'll keep on eyes on you, ugly!</i>

490
00:36:06,659 --> 00:36:08,577
I think Casper lives here.

491
00:36:08,661 --> 00:36:10,996
This place is even
worse than Gordon's room!

492
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:11,997
Yeah!

493
00:36:12,081 --> 00:36:13,999
You don't know how much my room is worth!

494
00:36:14,416 --> 00:36:17,252
Everything in first class?

495
00:36:23,217 --> 00:36:26,220
Hey, get out!
Get out! Get out!

496
00:36:27,304 --> 00:36:30,849
Hey, court lady!
Don't miss any spots!

497
00:36:30,933 --> 00:36:33,644
They never clean hotels very well.

498
00:36:33,727 --> 00:36:37,231
On top of that, I have very sensitive skin.

499
00:36:37,314 --> 00:36:42,069
Why am I a court lady?

500
00:36:42,111 --> 00:36:47,074
Court ladies just clean.
I'm a man.

501
00:36:47,116 --> 00:36:49,743
Man is a eunuch.

502
00:36:49,827 --> 00:36:50,953
You really wanna be a eunuch?

503
00:36:51,036 --> 00:36:55,666
I'd be honored.
Eunuchs don't have to clean.

504
00:36:57,042 --> 00:36:58,377
Come here.

505
00:37:03,757 --> 00:37:07,094
What? No!
Not really! But...

506
00:37:07,136 --> 00:37:10,597
what would they chop off their balls?

507
00:37:10,639 --> 00:37:13,892
What a horrible joke, Your Highness!

508
00:37:13,976 --> 00:37:15,811
I'm notjoking.

509
00:37:15,894 --> 00:37:17,813
- You still wanna be a eunuch?
- No!

510
00:37:19,815 --> 00:37:22,025
Get back to cleaning.

511
00:37:22,109 --> 00:37:23,527
Hey! Hey!

512
00:37:25,112 --> 00:37:28,532
You got your booger on my shirt!

513
00:37:28,615 --> 00:37:32,327
When did you come here?
You're like the wind.

514
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:34,246
Does she have a cold?

515
00:37:34,329 --> 00:37:36,039
You know how much this is?

516
00:37:36,123 --> 00:37:38,333
Damn it!

517
00:38:07,029 --> 00:38:09,865
Hello, sir!

518
00:38:12,242 --> 00:38:14,328
Here!
I love you!

519
00:38:14,369 --> 00:38:17,206
June! June!

520
00:38:17,289 --> 00:38:19,625
I got you something people take

521
00:38:19,708 --> 00:38:22,920
before auditions in Korea.

522
00:38:23,003 --> 00:38:24,421
Herbal remedy.

523
00:38:24,505 --> 00:38:25,923
Take it!

524
00:38:26,006 --> 00:38:28,133
It was tough finding that here.

525
00:38:28,217 --> 00:38:30,636
You remember what I said yesterday?

526
00:38:30,719 --> 00:38:33,639
Keep your eyes on the male judge

527
00:38:33,722 --> 00:38:36,141
and smile
every 10 seconds. Okay?

528
00:38:36,225 --> 00:38:40,562
- And also...
- 242 through 246, please.

529
00:38:41,814 --> 00:38:44,024
You're up? Just relax!

530
00:38:44,107 --> 00:38:45,651
Don't get nervous!

531
00:38:46,902 --> 00:38:48,862
You're making me nervous.

532
00:38:48,904 --> 00:38:51,532
High five!

533
00:38:53,826 --> 00:38:55,369
Little brat.

534
00:39:03,043 --> 00:39:04,378
She has to dance, too?

535
00:39:08,423 --> 00:39:10,968
- Does June dance well?
- What?

536
00:39:11,051 --> 00:39:13,053
Does your sister dance well?

537
00:39:13,929 --> 00:39:15,722
You won't tell me?

538
00:39:15,764 --> 00:39:18,100
Does she know about the dance?

539
00:39:18,892 --> 00:39:21,103
She doesn't look like a dancer.

540
00:39:21,186 --> 00:39:24,231
We're screwed.

541
00:39:50,007 --> 00:39:52,134
Your preselected song, please.

542
00:40:04,313 --> 00:40:06,440
- Preselected song, please.
- Choreography?

543
00:40:06,523 --> 00:40:08,150
Oh. Choreography.

544
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:41,099
Yay! June!

545
00:40:53,278 --> 00:40:58,200
June was a dancing queen in middle school!

546
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:35,696
Good job!

547
00:41:35,737 --> 00:41:40,283
I knew it!
I knew it!

548
00:41:41,702 --> 00:41:42,786
That's my girl!
That's my singer!

549
00:41:42,869 --> 00:41:46,081
- Did you guys eat anything?
- No! We are starving!

550
00:41:46,164 --> 00:41:48,000
- Aren't you hungry?
- Yes!

551
00:41:48,083 --> 00:41:50,293
Yeah, I'm starving, too.

552
00:41:50,377 --> 00:41:52,713
- Let's go!
- Yippe!

553
00:41:52,754 --> 00:41:55,882
High Five!
High Five!

554
00:41:57,884 --> 00:42:00,512
Wait for me!
I said wait!

555
00:42:09,396 --> 00:42:14,151
We'll make the contract
five... or ten years.

556
00:42:14,234 --> 00:42:16,862
Advertisements are separate contract.

557
00:42:16,945 --> 00:42:22,284
And events?
Let's think about that later.

558
00:42:22,826 --> 00:42:25,579
She's too big for Korea.

559
00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:28,081
She's gotta go global.

560
00:42:28,623 --> 00:42:31,376
And I'm her manager!

561
00:42:34,963 --> 00:42:37,966
Are you happy that we're all here together?

562
00:42:41,970 --> 00:42:43,972
You want me to sing you a song?

563
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:47,976
Mr. Dough you do Korea.

564
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:51,980
I'll go global, you asshole.

565
00:42:52,981 --> 00:42:55,609
<i>Sing it loud my love,</i>

566
00:42:55,650 --> 00:42:59,905
<i>You gotta sing with your heart now</i>

567
00:43:01,656 --> 00:43:05,202
<i>And if you get your heart broken girl</i>

568
00:43:05,285 --> 00:43:08,497
<i>Oh I promise it'll be okay</i>

569
00:43:11,083 --> 00:43:15,045
<i>You better listen up my baby</i>

570
00:43:15,128 --> 00:43:18,048
<i>I got something to say</i>

571
00:43:20,842 --> 00:43:25,555
<i>You know it's gon'be good</i> So <i>come on now</i>

572
00:43:25,639 --> 00:43:28,475
<i>it's time to rock'n roll</i>

573
00:43:31,436 --> 00:43:37,484
<i>Let the music enter your soul</i>

574
00:43:37,526 --> 00:43:41,655
<i>Feels good, just like I knew that it would</i>

575
00:43:41,738 --> 00:43:45,367
<i>Let go, don't let fear contain you</i>

576
00:43:45,450 --> 00:43:48,578
<i>Just let it rock 'n roll, come on</i>

577
00:43:51,373 --> 00:43:55,001
<i>I'm here.</i>
<i>I will never leave you</i>

578
00:43:55,043 --> 00:43:58,171
<i>Let the light within you shine on</i>

579
00:43:59,256 --> 00:44:04,010
<i>Let the music take control</i>

580
00:44:04,052 --> 00:44:05,387
<i>Let the music take control</i>

581
00:44:05,470 --> 00:44:06,596
Hi!

582
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:13,895
Don't be too nice to the kids.

583
00:44:13,979 --> 00:44:15,730
You'll end up getting hurt later.

584
00:44:15,814 --> 00:44:16,940
You think they'd understand you?

585
00:44:17,023 --> 00:44:20,360
Even a real family can become strangers.

586
00:44:20,402 --> 00:44:23,029
We're all alone in the end.

587
00:44:23,113 --> 00:44:25,866
You think I'm clueless, right?

588
00:44:25,907 --> 00:44:27,450
You don't know me.

589
00:44:27,534 --> 00:44:31,538
That's what I've learned all
my life being backstabbed.

590
00:44:33,123 --> 00:44:34,374
Listening to music, huh?

591
00:44:47,137 --> 00:44:50,599
What are you laundry service here?

592
00:44:51,266 --> 00:44:54,102
- Laundry service here?
- I'm not English.

593
00:44:57,147 --> 00:44:58,398
You good!

594
00:44:59,357 --> 00:45:00,775
Nice one!

595
00:45:15,999 --> 00:45:17,626
I knew you'd be sick.

596
00:45:18,418 --> 00:45:20,921
You were stuffing your face.

597
00:45:28,136 --> 00:45:30,347
It doesn't hurt.

598
00:45:30,430 --> 00:45:34,351
In Korea, we even take our
teeth out with a thread.

599
00:45:34,434 --> 00:45:37,145
I'm a Korean doctor.
It doesn't hurt, okay?

600
00:45:45,946 --> 00:45:50,367
Look at you. Don't you be
smiling like that to any guy.

601
00:45:59,167 --> 00:46:02,087
Won't hurt.
Okay. Okay.

602
00:46:08,468 --> 00:46:12,889
You ate too much.
Stop stuffing yourself.

603
00:46:18,812 --> 00:46:21,147
You just burped!

604
00:46:22,023 --> 00:46:25,026
<i>Unconditional unconditional!</i>

605
00:46:26,027 --> 00:46:29,239
<i>My love for you!</i>

606
00:46:29,823 --> 00:46:32,033
<i>Unconditional unconditional</i>

607
00:46:35,328 --> 00:46:37,956
<i>Unconditional unconditional</i>

608
00:46:44,421 --> 00:46:46,756
why does he make it so hard on himself

609
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:48,967
by drinking little by little?

610
00:46:49,050 --> 00:46:51,386
Probably 'cause he doesn't wanna be caught

611
00:46:51,428 --> 00:46:55,181
so he can drink a lot of
blood for a long time.

612
00:46:56,933 --> 00:46:58,977
I knew Rosie somehow wasn't
growing much these days...

613
00:46:59,060 --> 00:46:59,769
I know!

614
00:46:59,853 --> 00:47:02,355
This's my first time seeing
an actual vampire

615
00:47:02,439 --> 00:47:04,065
in my entire life.

616
00:47:04,149 --> 00:47:05,567
What do we do?

617
00:47:05,650 --> 00:47:08,695
We don't even have a cross or anything!

618
00:47:08,737 --> 00:47:10,780
I think that's a charm or something.

619
00:47:10,864 --> 00:47:14,743
Hurry up! Wake up Gordon.
Slowly, though. Slowly.

620
00:47:17,412 --> 00:47:19,831
Wake up, Gordon.
Come on.

621
00:47:23,585 --> 00:47:29,424
My love for you...

622
00:47:37,307 --> 00:47:40,268
who the hell is this?

623
00:47:48,234 --> 00:47:50,362
Hi, Chun-seop!

624
00:47:50,445 --> 00:47:54,282
Sorry sorry, I mean Mr. SHIN!
How long has it been?

625
00:47:54,324 --> 00:47:56,159
First time since you split with my money!

626
00:47:56,242 --> 00:47:58,370
Surprise!

627
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:01,456
Your friend O-bong says hi.

628
00:48:01,539 --> 00:48:04,959
He's doing very well with the
nurses in intensive care.

629
00:48:07,754 --> 00:48:09,381
Mr. Dough.

630
00:48:09,464 --> 00:48:13,176
I heard about the hot rookie, Mila.

631
00:48:13,259 --> 00:48:14,511
Pregnant, huh?

632
00:48:16,596 --> 00:48:19,808
I don't know what she was thinking.

633
00:48:19,891 --> 00:48:23,228
Don't say that.
Birth is a beautiful thing.

634
00:48:23,311 --> 00:48:27,816
Babies are born so that
people can die, right?

635
00:48:34,614 --> 00:48:36,032
Mr. Dough!

636
00:48:36,991 --> 00:48:41,538
I will be short and clear about this.

637
00:48:41,621 --> 00:48:44,124
I found a real gem.

638
00:48:44,207 --> 00:48:47,961
This one's
a 3-karat diamond.

639
00:48:48,628 --> 00:48:51,756
She passed an American audition,

640
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:53,758
in the first round.
50 to 1!

641
00:48:54,634 --> 00:48:57,971
As you can see, she's beautiful.

642
00:48:58,430 --> 00:49:00,640
Her eyes are alive.

643
00:49:01,349 --> 00:49:04,269
As fiesty as a cat,

644
00:49:04,352 --> 00:49:08,481
and as sweet and cute as a deer.

645
00:49:08,523 --> 00:49:15,321
And also... um...
She's quite sexy as well.

646
00:49:18,783 --> 00:49:20,201
Pervert.

647
00:49:23,079 --> 00:49:25,415
You're desperate, huh?

648
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:29,836
What?
This isn't it!

649
00:49:31,713 --> 00:49:32,839
Here.

650
00:49:34,090 --> 00:49:36,634
You know that it was me
who discovered Mila.

651
00:49:36,718 --> 00:49:39,554
Trust your gut.

652
00:49:39,596 --> 00:49:41,848
Why don't you just go and see?

653
00:49:41,890 --> 00:49:44,517
Then you'll see what I'm talking about.

654
00:49:50,315 --> 00:49:54,944
I already know my life
belongs in your hands.

655
00:49:58,740 --> 00:49:59,949
Passport.

656
00:50:00,909 --> 00:50:02,869
Give me your passport.

657
00:50:02,911 --> 00:50:05,872
Good bye, sir!
Take care!

658
00:50:23,723 --> 00:50:26,559
This is my card. Okay?

659
00:50:27,268 --> 00:50:29,687
This is me...
Give me a call. Okay?

660
00:50:29,771 --> 00:50:32,482
It was great seeing you.

661
00:50:32,565 --> 00:50:34,400
- Bye.
- Bye bye.

662
00:50:36,861 --> 00:50:39,697
- Keep singing.
- Okay.

663
00:50:39,781 --> 00:50:41,616
How do you know it's a famous agency?

664
00:50:41,658 --> 00:50:43,409
- You been there?
- I'll know tomorrow.

665
00:50:43,451 --> 00:50:45,787
What?
You're going there tomorrow?

666
00:50:45,870 --> 00:50:48,706
You can't just trust anyone!

667
00:50:50,291 --> 00:50:52,126
I'm not an idiot.

668
00:50:52,168 --> 00:50:55,004
Don't be so foolish!

669
00:50:55,088 --> 00:50:57,090
You don't know this field.

670
00:50:57,173 --> 00:50:59,634
Kids like you are easily fooled.

671
00:50:59,676 --> 00:51:02,428
Plus, you should be consulting me first.

672
00:51:02,470 --> 00:51:04,806
About things like this

673
00:51:04,889 --> 00:51:07,600
You can't just make decisions by yourself.

674
00:51:08,393 --> 00:51:09,519
Why not?

675
00:51:10,812 --> 00:51:12,730
<i>Cuz</i> we're a family.

676
00:51:15,650 --> 00:51:18,570
They just want me to win the audition.

677
00:51:18,653 --> 00:51:19,988
He'll get me vocals and

678
00:51:20,029 --> 00:51:21,281
choreography trainer til the finals.

679
00:51:21,322 --> 00:51:23,074
What about you?

680
00:51:24,158 --> 00:51:25,994
This is my chance.

681
00:51:29,831 --> 00:51:30,957
You little!

682
00:52:02,697 --> 00:52:07,619
She's needs a boob job.

683
00:52:07,702 --> 00:52:10,622
Right! Big ones!

684
00:52:10,705 --> 00:52:11,914
Good!

685
00:52:55,166 --> 00:52:56,876
That was amazing!

686
00:53:10,098 --> 00:53:11,599
He thinks he's got her?

687
00:53:11,683 --> 00:53:14,018
It's <i>cuz</i> he didn't go to the army.

688
00:53:14,811 --> 00:53:17,939
He's got no respect for
seniority in this field.

689
00:53:20,108 --> 00:53:26,155
I should've gotten her
signature on the contract!

690
00:53:27,824 --> 00:53:31,577
There's not even a breadcrumb!

691
00:53:34,622 --> 00:53:36,457
There is a breadcrumb!

692
00:53:36,541 --> 00:53:38,584
If you ate all the bread...

693
00:53:40,336 --> 00:53:41,587
what the?

694
00:53:49,971 --> 00:53:51,097
Hey!

695
00:53:51,764 --> 00:53:53,474
Where're the kids?

696
00:53:54,142 --> 00:53:59,605
You... where... Children?
Damn this English!

697
00:54:08,489 --> 00:54:12,201
Damn it!
They all look alike!

698
00:54:12,285 --> 00:54:17,039
It'd be hard to miss the pack.

699
00:54:17,123 --> 00:54:18,332
<i>Geez</i> I'm hungry!

700
00:54:18,916 --> 00:54:22,044
The <i>party's</i> not that good.

701
00:54:22,128 --> 00:54:24,630
We'd better go.

702
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:55,870
Hey! Where the hell
have you been?

703
00:54:56,662 --> 00:54:58,998
The kids were hungry.

704
00:55:00,666 --> 00:55:02,877
Who told you to wander the streets?

705
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:05,171
What if something happens to you, huh?

706
00:55:05,254 --> 00:55:08,508
Then what'll happen to me, huh?

707
00:55:08,549 --> 00:55:12,386
You think that lady with the
big boobs will leave me alone?

708
00:55:13,262 --> 00:55:14,430
You think I'm worried about you?

709
00:55:14,514 --> 00:55:16,349
Not at all!

710
00:55:16,390 --> 00:55:19,519
You think you'd be okay if I'm deported?

711
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:25,525
- Papa, I'm hungry.
- Hungry?

712
00:55:43,417 --> 00:55:44,043
Show time!

713
00:55:44,126 --> 00:55:45,127

00:55:59,559 --> 00:56:01,978
It's nice to see you here in America!

716
00:56:02,061 --> 00:56:04,063
We love you folks!

717
00:56:04,647 --> 00:56:09,402
Gordon on keyboard, Jimmy
on guitar, Tommy on base!

718
00:56:12,363 --> 00:56:15,741
<i>Call me when you need me</i>

719
00:56:15,783 --> 00:56:18,244
<i>I'll run to you</i>

720
00:56:19,203 --> 00:56:22,915
<i>Day or night,</i>

721
00:56:22,999 --> 00:56:25,334
<i>I'll run there</i>

722
00:56:26,419 --> 00:56:29,755
<i>I might think about it</i>

723
00:56:29,797 --> 00:56:33,342
<i>if you were someone else</i>

724
00:56:33,426 --> 00:56:36,929
<i>But if you call me</i>

725
00:56:37,013 --> 00:56:39,849
<i>I'll run there no matter what!</i>

726
00:56:43,728 --> 00:56:47,148
<i>My love for you is</i>

727
00:56:47,231 --> 00:56:49,859
<i>unconditional, unconditional</i>

728
00:56:49,942 --> 00:56:51,360
Come out here, folks!

729
00:56:51,444 --> 00:56:57,783
<i>My love for you is special.</i>

730
00:56:59,827 --> 00:57:03,289
<i>Across the Pacific, Atlantic</i>

731
00:57:03,331 --> 00:57:05,875
<i>and Indian Ocean,</i>

732
00:57:06,959 --> 00:57:10,379
<i>I'll run to you if you call me.</i>

733
00:57:10,463 --> 00:57:14,634
<i>I'll run there no matter what!</i>

734
00:57:26,896 --> 00:57:28,230
Cool!

735
00:57:35,112 --> 00:57:36,530
Thank you!

736
00:57:45,206 --> 00:57:48,167
Stop pigging out!

737
00:57:49,126 --> 00:57:55,341
My love for you is special.

738
00:58:32,086 --> 00:58:33,421
Are you absolutely sure that

739
00:58:33,504 --> 00:58:35,715
she filed the application herself?

740
00:58:39,010 --> 00:58:41,721
Even if she did file it
herself, she's still a minor.

741
00:58:41,804 --> 00:58:43,931
How can you go and accept it?

742
00:58:44,015 --> 00:58:47,059
Is it that easy to make
a request for an adoption?

743
00:59:07,038 --> 00:59:09,373
- Not yet?
- Not yet.

744
00:59:35,900 --> 00:59:39,445
Oh, it's our pleasure.
We waited for this moment.

745
00:59:40,488 --> 00:59:42,948
She is a very special young lady.

746
00:59:42,990 --> 00:59:46,118
And she is also excited
about her own new family.

747
00:59:46,202 --> 00:59:50,331
- Aren't you, Maya?
- Um... Yeah.

748
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:54,960
All the documents
will be ready in two weeks

749
00:59:55,002 --> 00:59:56,629
and you can take her to her new home.

750
00:59:56,712 --> 00:59:57,671
Great.

751
00:59:57,713 --> 00:59:59,840
Her new brothers and sisters
will be waiting there as well.

752
00:59:59,924 --> 01:00:02,760
This is gonna be a big
celebration for our family.

753
01:00:04,845 --> 01:00:06,347
I think she's going to be a good fit.

754
01:00:07,014 --> 01:00:09,850
- Very excited.
- Yea, she's gonna fit right in.

755
01:00:10,851 --> 01:00:12,478
Where are you going?

756
01:00:12,520 --> 01:00:14,480
We gotta choose the song by today.

757
01:00:14,522 --> 01:00:17,358
Come on.

758
01:00:17,858 --> 01:00:19,568
Hey!

759
01:00:20,945 --> 01:00:24,573
I'm talking here, can't you hear?

760
01:00:24,657 --> 01:00:27,076
I'm worried sick I can't get a hold of June

761
01:00:27,159 --> 01:00:29,662
and you're backing out
<i>cuz</i> she's a bit late?

762
01:00:29,745 --> 01:00:31,580
You just fooling with her?

763
01:00:31,664 --> 01:00:33,582
Thought you're gonna
take her to the finals.

764
01:00:36,377 --> 01:00:38,295
- I was going to.
- And? And?

765
01:00:38,379 --> 01:00:42,383
Look! I'm businessman.
This is business.

766
01:00:42,466 --> 01:00:45,678
I don't take chances on risk.

767
01:00:45,761 --> 01:00:48,389
You understand?
You understand, right?

768
01:00:53,561 --> 01:00:55,104
Good for you, jerk!

769
01:00:56,188 --> 01:00:59,608
Court lady!
June not back yet? No calls?

770
01:01:00,693 --> 01:01:01,819
Where are you?

771
01:01:02,278 --> 01:01:06,031
How do you know if she's back
if you're in a diner?

772
01:01:06,073 --> 01:01:07,825
Get your ass here now!

773
01:01:07,908 --> 01:01:09,618
Leave the fries!

774
01:01:12,496 --> 01:01:14,373
What's she doing?
Hey!

775
01:01:14,832 --> 01:01:16,750
Hey! Hey!

776
01:01:18,836 --> 01:01:19,962
Where you going?

777
01:01:23,549 --> 01:01:25,759
Where are you going?

778
01:01:27,928 --> 01:01:29,180
What are you doing?

779
01:01:30,556 --> 01:01:32,892
- Stop!
- Let go!

780
01:01:32,933 --> 01:01:34,977
It's all over!
I don't need this!

781
01:01:35,060 --> 01:01:37,271
- Get off the car!
- Let's talk about this!

782
01:01:37,354 --> 01:01:39,398
About what?

783
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:41,692
Why can't I just do what I want?

784
01:01:41,775 --> 01:01:42,902
I don't need audition or the kids.

785
01:01:42,943 --> 01:01:44,486
Just calm down!

786
01:01:44,570 --> 01:01:47,072
- I'm gonna live my own life!
- Stop!

787
01:02:04,089 --> 01:02:07,092
I know things are difficult.

788
01:02:07,176 --> 01:02:09,136
I know you wanna have fun.

789
01:02:09,178 --> 01:02:12,806
At that age girls wanna see boys and

790
01:02:12,890 --> 01:02:16,560
go somewhere dark and
smooch... when I was young I...

791
01:02:18,437 --> 01:02:22,775
But you gotta try
your best until the finals.

792
01:02:22,816 --> 01:02:25,361
You even brought your family here.

793
01:02:25,444 --> 01:02:27,363
Don't worry too much
about picking the song.

794
01:02:27,446 --> 01:02:30,074
It's your choice so you just...

795
01:02:30,157 --> 01:02:31,867
I didn't believe you when you said that

796
01:02:34,036 --> 01:02:36,580
I'll get hurt and end up alone.

797
01:02:38,249 --> 01:02:42,461
- You were listening?
- I still don't wanna admit it.

798
01:02:43,837 --> 01:02:46,173
Life's been too hard for that.

799
01:02:50,469 --> 01:02:52,179
Can I ask you something?

800
01:02:56,684 --> 01:02:58,394
I don't remember my mom.

801
01:03:01,272 --> 01:03:02,898
<i>Cuz</i> I hate her.

802
01:03:06,193 --> 01:03:10,406
I have no memory of her
but hatred. Am I bad?

803
01:03:16,120 --> 01:03:17,746
I want to forgive her.

804
01:03:20,624 --> 01:03:23,460
But she brought all of us together

805
01:03:24,211 --> 01:03:27,339
lived her own life and died her own way.

806
01:03:31,135 --> 01:03:34,555
I've never blamed the kids
no matter how hard it got.

807
01:03:39,935 --> 01:03:45,274
She caused so much pain

808
01:03:46,567 --> 01:03:48,068
And suffering in my life.

809
01:03:50,571 --> 01:03:53,991
Now I can't even be angry at her.

810
01:03:54,074 --> 01:03:55,492
I can never forgive her for that.

811
01:03:58,746 --> 01:04:00,289
Am I bad?

812
01:04:21,518 --> 01:04:24,730
So, do you wanna live anywhere over here?

813
01:04:25,439 --> 01:04:28,942
Do you see that star that's blinking?

814
01:04:29,026 --> 01:04:29,943
Yeah.

815
01:04:30,027 --> 01:04:32,446
Do you think that's a shooting star?

816
01:04:34,448 --> 01:04:37,159
Rosie, what do you think about
living in one of these places?

817
01:04:37,242 --> 01:04:39,453
I think that one's Cinderella's castle.

818
01:04:39,536 --> 01:04:41,580
Cinderella's castle?

819
01:04:42,831 --> 01:04:44,166
That's nice.

820
01:05:05,270 --> 01:05:07,981
Why don't you wanna go to orphanage?

821
01:05:09,650 --> 01:05:13,487
It's not much different
from where you live now.

822
01:05:15,322 --> 01:05:19,034
Jimmy and Tommy are waiting for their dad.

823
01:05:21,412 --> 01:05:27,459
Their dad told them he'll
come back when he makes money.

824
01:05:28,710 --> 01:05:30,671
Stupid.

825
01:05:31,922 --> 01:05:36,051
Parents who leave never come back.

826
01:05:36,135 --> 01:05:37,970
Don't they know that?

827
01:05:40,139 --> 01:05:41,974
I know that.

828
01:05:48,522 --> 01:05:50,065
Yeah?

829
01:06:00,367 --> 01:06:02,494
Her nose is running.

830
01:06:05,164 --> 01:06:06,665
Has she got a cold?

831
01:06:08,542 --> 01:06:10,294
Let's go in.

832
01:06:19,720 --> 01:06:21,138
Hello?

833
01:06:34,026 --> 01:06:35,152
June!

834
01:06:48,123 --> 01:06:51,585
- It's a carnival!
- It's amazing!

835
01:06:52,127 --> 01:06:53,962
I love this!
It's unbelievable!

836
01:06:54,046 --> 01:06:55,255
I'm going.

837
01:06:56,340 --> 01:06:57,966
Come on!
Come on!

838
01:06:58,050 --> 01:06:59,259
Great, huh?

839
01:07:22,783 --> 01:07:26,245
<i>Hi, kids!</i>
<i>Surprise!</i>

840
01:07:26,787 --> 01:07:27,246
Mommy!

841
01:07:27,287 --> 01:07:29,122
<i>I told those people to set it up</i>

842
01:07:29,206 --> 01:07:30,415
<i>when you are all in school.</i>

843
01:07:30,499 --> 01:07:34,628
<i>I don't know if it worked</i>
<i>or not. But, anyway.</i>

844
01:07:34,711 --> 01:07:37,256
If <i>you're watching this,</i>

845
01:07:37,297 --> 01:07:40,634
<i>it would mean that I haven't</i>
<i>kept my promise again...</i>

846
01:07:40,717 --> 01:07:43,929
<i>Oh, I'm really really sorry.</i>

847
01:07:44,429 --> 01:07:46,139
<i>But, listen, kids.</i>

848
01:07:46,223 --> 01:07:50,644
Will you be sure to cut June's
birthday cake together for me?

849
01:07:51,937 --> 01:07:54,856
<i>Throw a great</i> party
<i>for her! Okay?</i>

850
01:07:54,940 --> 01:07:59,653
<i>Oh, I have presents for all of you as well.</i>

851
01:07:59,736 --> 01:08:02,948
<i>They are 'thanks-for-</i><i>
<i>going-to-church'presents!</i>

852
01:08:05,659 --> 01:08:08,078
<i>Hey! What are you waiting for?</i>

853
01:08:08,161 --> 01:08:09,371
Go <i>find them, quick!</i>

854
01:08:09,454 --> 01:08:10,455
Found it!

855
01:08:10,539 --> 01:08:13,166
<i>Hurry up! Quick!</i>
Go <i>find em.</i>

856
01:08:13,250 --> 01:08:14,418
<i>Quick, quick, quick!</i>

857
01:08:18,088 --> 01:08:22,134
I think your mom wanted to do this at home

858
01:08:22,175 --> 01:08:24,011
but I brought it here.

859
01:08:27,806 --> 01:08:29,433
<i>June, you there?</i>

860
01:08:30,892 --> 01:08:34,146
<i>I got some money.</i>

861
01:08:34,187 --> 01:08:39,151
<i>I prepared a little</i>
<i>something for your</i> party.

862
01:08:39,192 --> 01:08:41,153
<i>You must be mad at me again</i>

863
01:08:43,196 --> 01:08:46,533
<i>For wasting money, you'd say.</i>

864
01:08:48,535 --> 01:08:49,745
Oh, it fits!

865
01:08:52,706 --> 01:08:58,545
<i>I wanted to apologize</i>

866
01:08:59,546 --> 01:09:04,968
<i>You were right about what</i>
<i>you said last time we fought.</i>

867
01:09:06,053 --> 01:09:10,557
<i>That I'm chasing dreams and</i>

868
01:09:10,641 --> 01:09:15,395
<i>making your lives miserable.</i>

869
01:09:16,688 --> 01:09:21,109
<i>But June, youguys are always in my songs.</i>

870
01:09:21,985 --> 01:09:24,196
<i>I sing for you guys.</i>

871
01:09:24,279 --> 01:09:30,118
<i>And singing for you makes me happy.</i>

872
01:09:31,495 --> 01:09:35,415
So <i>I'm always thankful for you.</i>

873
01:09:35,499 --> 01:09:38,627
<i>And I'm sorry</i> too.

874
01:09:40,796 --> 01:09:43,840
<i>My sweet baby June.</i>

875
01:09:43,924 --> 01:09:46,134
<i>Things aren't easy, right?</i>

876
01:09:50,514 --> 01:09:56,144
<i>I'll try harder.</i>
<i>Try my best.</i>

877
01:09:56,228 --> 01:10:03,228
<i>I'll work hard so that</i>
<i>my baby June can be happy.</i>

878
01:10:06,822 --> 01:10:09,658
<i>I love you, June.</i>
<i>Happy Birthday!</i>

879
01:10:20,627 --> 01:10:22,379
This is for June!

880
01:10:24,756 --> 01:10:27,175
June! This is for you!

881
01:10:37,853 --> 01:10:41,690
June, are you crying?

882
01:10:56,079 --> 01:10:57,497
Mom!

883
01:10:58,790 --> 01:11:00,500
Mom!

884
01:11:33,450 --> 01:11:35,786
Happy birthday to you, June!

885
01:11:35,869 --> 01:11:38,705
You're looking nice today, June!

886
01:11:38,747 --> 01:11:41,500
You look young
for your age. June!

887
01:11:41,541 --> 01:11:43,376
Thanks for everything, June!

888
01:11:43,460 --> 01:11:46,171
Happy birthday to ya!
June!

889
01:11:55,055 --> 01:11:57,390
You making a cocktail?
Throw that out!

890
01:12:13,698 --> 01:12:14,950
Throw it!

891
01:12:17,536 --> 01:12:19,037
- Run away!
- Run!

892
01:12:19,120 --> 01:12:26,120
Window... a... magical goose
came and... landed in her...

893
01:12:31,049 --> 01:12:35,262
- A beautiful princess.
- A beautiful princess!

894
01:12:38,431 --> 01:12:39,891
Fighting!

895
01:12:49,192 --> 01:12:50,443
<i>EXCLUSIVE CONTRACT</i>

896
01:12:50,569 --> 01:12:53,196
Things are on a roll here!

897
01:12:54,364 --> 01:12:56,783
Great soup!

898
01:12:57,951 --> 01:12:59,202
Stamp it!

899
01:12:59,286 --> 01:13:01,705
This is too quick.

900
01:13:01,788 --> 01:13:03,498
I'm in a hurry!

901
01:13:03,582 --> 01:13:06,001
My girl band is releasing
a single next month.

902
01:13:06,084 --> 01:13:10,922
I have to get their choreography
and do all their PR!

903
01:13:10,964 --> 01:13:12,591
It's just that...

904
01:13:12,674 --> 01:13:15,343
I'll minus the <i>thirty</i> grand
you spent on Mila.

905
01:13:15,427 --> 01:13:17,429
I won't kill you and minus
<i>thirty</i> grand off your debt.

906
01:13:17,512 --> 01:13:20,140
You're good luck.

907
01:13:20,223 --> 01:13:23,435
You know my temper, right?
I would've killed you already.

908
01:13:23,518 --> 01:13:26,146
Thank you.
But...

909
01:13:27,022 --> 01:13:32,861
If June goes to Korea,
what'll happen to her family?

910
01:13:34,154 --> 01:13:36,865
They're not her family.
They're not blood-related!

911
01:13:36,948 --> 01:13:41,161
But she'll never wanna go
to Korea because of them.

912
01:13:42,037 --> 01:13:43,788
Damn it!

913
01:13:44,456 --> 01:13:46,791
Sir, I mean...

914
01:13:46,833 --> 01:13:49,669
Come on, Mr. Dough!

915
01:13:49,753 --> 01:13:52,380
We got this huge market in US.

916
01:13:52,464 --> 01:13:53,882
People kill to come here.

917
01:13:53,965 --> 01:13:56,801
Let's first win the audition

918
01:13:56,843 --> 01:13:57,886
and release an album.

919
01:13:57,969 --> 01:13:59,387
Then Korea's out of the question.

920
01:13:59,471 --> 01:14:02,474
You got <i>thirty</i> grand on you?

921
01:14:02,557 --> 01:14:04,601
Or you wanna rot in jail in Korea?

922
01:14:04,684 --> 01:14:08,980
I'm cutting you some slack
<i>cuz</i> you're their papa.

923
01:14:10,482 --> 01:14:11,816
Screw this!

924
01:14:11,858 --> 01:14:14,527
Rip up the contract and

925
01:14:14,611 --> 01:14:16,029
let's go back to Korea.

926
01:14:16,112 --> 01:14:18,740
I'll cut you up and see if you
got <i>thirty</i> grand in there.

927
01:14:23,119 --> 01:14:24,663
Look, you moron.

928
01:14:25,121 --> 01:14:30,251
Wake up, you idiot!
Smarten up!

929
01:14:33,838 --> 01:14:40,838
Then what will happen to her
family if she goes to Korea?

930
01:14:44,432 --> 01:14:49,062
Well, I don't know.

931
01:14:51,731 --> 01:14:55,193
I guess you'll have to help.

932
01:14:58,571 --> 01:15:00,991
Yeah?
Okay?

933
01:15:34,232 --> 01:15:35,942
- Nice job!
- Yeah!

934
01:15:36,026 --> 01:15:40,071
Yes! Nice job, big G!
Rosie!

935
01:15:42,115 --> 01:15:44,659
Think this is funny?

936
01:15:45,535 --> 01:15:47,579
Think I wanna joke around?

937
01:15:48,621 --> 01:15:51,958
Don't you immature brats know anything?

938
01:15:54,627 --> 01:15:55,962
Get the hell out.

939
01:15:58,631 --> 01:16:00,258
Get the hell out of here!

940
01:16:37,420 --> 01:16:39,339
Looking back,

941
01:16:40,715 --> 01:16:42,967
I think I liked you the most.

942
01:16:44,844 --> 01:16:47,972
We're similar.
Both selfish.

943
01:16:49,641 --> 01:16:51,142
In the end...

944
01:17:11,746 --> 01:17:14,624
Papa!
Papa!

945
01:17:24,092 --> 01:17:25,343
Papa!

946
01:17:37,021 --> 01:17:41,442
I never wake up before 11 am
so don't wake me up.

947
01:17:42,527 --> 01:17:46,447
You don't know what's behind
this friendly-looking face.

948
01:17:52,036 --> 01:17:55,874
I'll be going to Korea in a few days.

949
01:17:55,915 --> 01:17:58,459
What'll happen to the kids

950
01:17:58,543 --> 01:18:01,963
if you're giving up your guardianship?

951
01:18:04,257 --> 01:18:06,885
- Got more rice?
- Asshole.

952
01:18:11,431 --> 01:18:17,228
Gordon Jackson, Maya Hashim,
Jimmy Taylor...

953
01:18:17,270 --> 01:18:21,816
Tommy Taylor, and Rosie Valencia.

954
01:18:23,401 --> 01:18:27,530
The children will be sent to
the same facility for now.

955
01:18:28,114 --> 01:18:30,533
Afterwards, we'll go through
the procedure of finding

956
01:18:30,617 --> 01:18:33,536
the appropriate facility for each child.

957
01:18:33,620 --> 01:18:37,040
June, your custody status is still valid.

958
01:18:37,123 --> 01:18:39,542
However because you're a minor,

959
01:18:39,626 --> 01:18:42,045
if you can't contact the guardian,

960
01:18:42,128 --> 01:18:44,547
you'll need to request police protection.

961
01:18:44,631 --> 01:18:46,925
And I also need to be notified.

962
01:18:49,219 --> 01:18:51,054
Honey, in this country,

963
01:18:51,221 --> 01:18:55,558
we have strict child protection laws.

964
01:18:57,143 --> 01:19:01,189
- It's the very basis for...
- He'll call.

965
01:19:03,524 --> 01:19:05,652
There's still hope.

966
01:19:12,158 --> 01:19:13,952
Won't you listen to what I say?

967
01:19:14,035 --> 01:19:16,996
You guys, Rosie, please open the door!

968
01:19:17,080 --> 01:19:18,998
No! Go away!

969
01:19:19,082 --> 01:19:21,125
Please.
Sorry Rosie.

970
01:19:22,877 --> 01:19:24,837
You just need to be there
for a little while.

971
01:19:24,879 --> 01:19:27,715
Soon, I'll be there to get you, Rosie.

972
01:19:27,799 --> 01:19:31,511
Liars!
All adults are lying!

973
01:19:32,011 --> 01:19:34,806
June, you're also lying!

974
01:19:39,018 --> 01:19:43,648
Gordon, why are you also acting like this?

975
01:19:43,690 --> 01:19:45,817
Jimmy, Tommy, open up.

976
01:19:46,401 --> 01:19:48,361
I told Phoebe all about your dad,

977
01:19:48,403 --> 01:19:50,029
how he might be back for you.

978
01:19:50,113 --> 01:19:52,031
This might be for the best, you know?

979
01:19:52,115 --> 01:19:53,741
So don't worry about it too much.

980
01:19:53,825 --> 01:19:56,244
Do you think they're really
waiting for their dad?

981
01:19:56,911 --> 01:19:58,538
Do you think that's why they're here?

982
01:19:58,913 --> 01:20:00,540
We should've split up at the beginning.

983
01:20:01,124 --> 01:20:03,334
Then we just ended up hurting the kids.

984
01:20:05,336 --> 01:20:07,964
Jimmy, Tommy, open the door!

985
01:20:08,047 --> 01:20:10,174
You know there's no other way!

986
01:20:10,216 --> 01:20:12,468
You think it's just the kids getting hurt?

987
01:20:12,552 --> 01:20:14,554
Do I look like someone who never gets hurt?

988
01:20:14,637 --> 01:20:16,556
Who asked you to get hurt?

989
01:20:17,849 --> 01:20:18,766
You could've given up at the beginning

990
01:20:18,850 --> 01:20:20,560
if you didn't think you could handle it!

991
01:20:21,728 --> 01:20:23,062
What made you stay?

992
01:20:24,230 --> 01:20:25,690
Just so you could have a peace of mind?

993
01:20:28,735 --> 01:20:30,278
Peace of mind?

994
01:20:32,739 --> 01:20:35,867
Then are you running away
for your peace of mind?

995
01:20:35,950 --> 01:20:37,702
I did my best for our family!

996
01:20:37,744 --> 01:20:38,995
I didn't run away like you,

997
01:20:39,078 --> 01:20:43,374
and tried to the point where
I'm not ashamed of myself.

998
01:20:43,458 --> 01:20:46,294
Anything I could do for our family, I...

999
01:20:51,883 --> 01:20:53,301
Tell me, June.

1000
01:20:54,677 --> 01:20:56,804
What makes us a family?

1001
01:21:06,773 --> 01:21:12,820
Do I need to say that in words?

1002
01:21:23,247 --> 01:21:24,874
Don't fight.

1003
01:23:07,393 --> 01:23:10,897
Good! Good!
My neck!

1004
01:23:12,064 --> 01:23:14,942
Oh my God!
You must be so worried!

1005
01:23:16,110 --> 01:23:19,447
Chun-seop!
What a bad man he is!

1006
01:23:20,615 --> 01:23:22,241
He just wanted the contract.

1007
01:23:22,325 --> 01:23:24,660
I didn't know what was going on.

1008
01:23:26,829 --> 01:23:31,667
Again, I'm never forcing
you to go to Korea.

1009
01:23:33,336 --> 01:23:36,255
But!

1010
01:23:36,339 --> 01:23:37,965
Let's think about this together.

1011
01:23:38,758 --> 01:23:40,885
Next year you'll be an adult.

1012
01:23:40,927 --> 01:23:42,553
You can bring your family to Korea.

1013
01:23:42,637 --> 01:23:45,389
But imagine not having any money!

1014
01:23:45,431 --> 01:23:47,475
Or a home!
How would that be?

1015
01:23:47,558 --> 01:23:49,477
Think siblings will be happy?

1016
01:23:54,649 --> 01:23:59,195
June, I really wanna help you.

1017
01:23:59,278 --> 01:24:02,198
But! There's nothing
I can do here.

1018
01:24:02,281 --> 01:24:05,701
I can only help you in Korea.
Trust me!

1019
01:24:07,954 --> 01:24:10,289
Okay?
Trust me! Okay?

1020
01:24:10,665 --> 01:24:12,124
A year max,

1021
01:24:12,166 --> 01:24:14,252
and your world will be
completely different.

1022
01:24:14,293 --> 01:24:16,337
A new world!

1023
01:24:17,505 --> 01:24:18,839
Then after that,

1024
01:24:18,923 --> 01:24:20,132
you can always bring your siblings...

1025
01:24:20,216 --> 01:24:22,552
- Do I...
- Do I what?

1026
01:24:22,635 --> 01:24:24,345
Do I have to come back here?

1027
01:25:30,036 --> 01:25:31,336
Hurry up, Chunseop!

1028
01:25:32,538 --> 01:25:37,168
<i>Hello, Your Highness.</i>
<i>This is court lady Gordon.</i>

1029
01:25:38,419 --> 01:25:41,380
<i>How are you feeling?</i>

1030
01:25:43,549 --> 01:25:49,180
<i>We're not with June right now.</i>

1031
01:25:51,140 --> 01:25:53,267
<i>We're not home any more.</i>

1032
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:59,065
<i>We have something to tell Your Highness.</i>

1033
01:26:02,360 --> 01:26:04,278
<i>Sorry for hitting your head, yo!</i>

1034
01:26:04,362 --> 01:26:06,364
<i>Sorry for surprising you, yo!</i>

1035
01:26:06,447 --> 01:26:08,783
<i>Your dancing we really missing, yo!</i>

1036
01:26:08,866 --> 01:26:11,994
<i>Your finer singing we really missing, yo!</i>

1037
01:26:12,078 --> 01:26:13,496
<i>Come on! Yo!</i>

1038
01:26:16,791 --> 01:26:19,627
<i>We're sorry for hitting you head.</i>

1039
01:26:23,589 --> 01:26:27,843
<i>And for many things, yo!</i>

1040
01:26:30,805 --> 01:26:33,766
<i>You said you wanted to say</i>
<i>something too, right? Rosie?</i>

1041
01:26:35,810 --> 01:26:38,437
<i>No? You don't</i>
<i>want to say anything?</i>

1042
01:26:38,521 --> 01:26:40,856
<i>I can't speak Korean.</i>

1043
01:26:43,025 --> 01:26:44,652
<i>Okay. Don't worry.</i>

1044
01:26:45,611 --> 01:26:50,241
<i>She said she wanted to</i>
<i>say something before.</i>

1045
01:26:50,324 --> 01:26:53,285
<i>Rosie wanted to tell Your Highness...</i>

1046
01:26:53,327 --> 01:26:55,579
<i>Unconditional unconditional</i>

1047
01:26:56,956 --> 01:26:59,458
<i>Unconditional unconditional</i>

1048
01:27:00,835 --> 01:27:04,880
<i>My love for you is</i>

1049
01:27:04,964 --> 01:27:07,675
<i>unconditional, unconditional</i>

1050
01:27:08,467 --> 01:27:11,679
<i>Unconditional unconditional</i>

1051
01:27:11,762 --> 01:27:14,432
<i>Unconditional unconditional</i>

1052
01:27:14,473 --> 01:27:17,309
<i>- Okay, okay.</i>
<i>- I love you, papa!</i>

1053
01:27:18,310 --> 01:27:20,521
<i>June, she needs us, yo!</i>

1054
01:27:20,688 --> 01:27:23,149
<i>June, she only happy if we're there, yo!</i>

1055
01:27:23,190 --> 01:27:26,652
<i>You, we need</i> too,
<i>to make a full rainbow, yo!</i>

1056
01:27:26,694 --> 01:27:30,448
A <i>mighty, the most powerful,</i>
<i>rainbow family, yeah!</i>

1057
01:27:31,407 --> 01:27:37,329
<i>We have a favor to ask, Your Highness.</i>

1058
01:27:55,347 --> 01:27:57,266
I wanna go home.

1059
01:27:57,641 --> 01:28:00,644
Guys, believe or not,
I actually miss Chun-seop.

1060
01:28:00,728 --> 01:28:02,771
I really miss June.

1061
01:28:02,855 --> 01:28:05,065
Dude, we could be making a hit
with our rap songs now!

1062
01:28:05,149 --> 01:28:07,359
- We could be in Harlem!
- Yeah!

1063
01:28:17,203 --> 01:28:21,499
I think probably that we will
be coming out to see you.

1064
01:28:24,001 --> 01:28:27,338
Are you really going to leave
without saying goodbye to them?

1065
01:28:47,733 --> 01:28:50,361
Your father! Come!

1066
01:28:51,612 --> 01:28:52,738
Come here!

1067
01:29:01,747 --> 01:29:03,165
Okay!

1068
01:29:04,250 --> 01:29:06,252
You want tip?
You did nothing!

1069
01:29:07,628 --> 01:29:10,172
America's done nothing for me!

1070
01:29:10,256 --> 01:29:12,758
They're all crooks!

1071
01:29:15,261 --> 01:29:17,721
What'd be a good name for you, June?

1072
01:29:17,763 --> 01:29:20,516
How about July?

1073
01:29:21,267 --> 01:29:24,603
Sounds too much
like a geisha. Let's go.

1074
01:29:25,771 --> 01:29:28,148
- May? That's my puppy's name.
- Stop

1075
01:29:30,276 --> 01:29:30,818
SHIN Chun-seop?

1076
01:29:30,901 --> 01:29:33,612
June!
You can't go right now.

1077
01:29:33,696 --> 01:29:36,031
You have to go to the audition!

1078
01:29:36,907 --> 01:29:38,826
Chun-seop!

1079
01:29:39,201 --> 01:29:41,620
June, don't go now!
Let's go to the audition!

1080
01:29:41,704 --> 01:29:44,415
Let's be gentle, Chun-seop!

1081
01:29:44,498 --> 01:29:46,125
- This is unfair.
- What about the kids?

1082
01:29:46,208 --> 01:29:47,751
Don't you feel sorry for them?

1083
01:29:47,793 --> 01:29:49,253
You have no right to ask me that!

1084
01:29:49,295 --> 01:29:52,131
I know I don't!
I have no right!

1085
01:29:52,214 --> 01:29:54,341
But they're waiting for you!

1086
01:29:54,425 --> 01:29:56,427
What do you want me to do?

1087
01:29:56,510 --> 01:30:00,472
I can't do it anymore!
I have nothing left!

1088
01:30:01,223 --> 01:30:03,142
What do you want me to do?

1089
01:30:03,225 --> 01:30:05,769
Cut this crap!
Let's go.

1090
01:30:08,147 --> 01:30:09,148
What the hell?

1091
01:30:11,442 --> 01:30:12,568
You little!

1092
01:30:16,822 --> 01:30:18,574
Get that bastard!

1093
01:30:18,657 --> 01:30:21,368
If you leave now you'll regret this!

1094
01:30:21,452 --> 01:30:25,080
I know what regret is.
You know what loneliness is?

1095
01:30:25,164 --> 01:30:26,957
You know what it's like being alone?

1096
01:30:28,959 --> 01:30:30,878
You know what they asked me?

1097
01:30:30,961 --> 01:30:34,089
They asked me to make you a famous star

1098
01:30:34,173 --> 01:30:36,091
so that they can find you.

1099
01:30:36,175 --> 01:30:37,801
How can you leave them behind?

1100
01:30:37,843 --> 01:30:40,679
You'll regret it.

1101
01:30:49,063 --> 01:30:53,108
Don't go, June!
You'll regret it!

1102
01:30:54,485 --> 01:30:55,486
Don't go!

1103
01:30:55,569 --> 01:30:58,197
Get that moron!

1104
01:30:58,280 --> 01:30:59,406
June!

1105
01:31:16,632 --> 01:31:18,342
- June!
- Hurry!

1106
01:31:29,353 --> 01:31:31,855
Later, losers! Yeah!

1107
01:31:43,659 --> 01:31:45,160
Maya!

1108
01:31:45,244 --> 01:31:46,495
Rosie!

1109
01:31:47,746 --> 01:31:48,997
Look, we gotta go!

1110
01:31:56,255 --> 01:31:58,215
Wonderful, thank you!

1111
01:32:04,388 --> 01:32:05,305
So, how's she doing in school?

1112
01:32:05,389 --> 01:32:06,890
Oh, she's doing very well in school.

1113
01:32:06,974 --> 01:32:08,225
Oh, what are her favorite classes?

1114
01:32:08,267 --> 01:32:09,393
Math and singing.

1115
01:32:09,476 --> 01:32:11,228
- Really?
- Singing!

1116
01:32:16,817 --> 01:32:18,861
Dude! It's Maya!

1117
01:32:36,128 --> 01:32:37,671
Maya!

1118
01:32:40,841 --> 01:32:41,800
You know what?

1119
01:32:41,842 --> 01:32:45,387
I think I look a lot better with my makeup!

1120
01:32:47,765 --> 01:32:50,684
Maya! Maya!

1121
01:32:51,977 --> 01:32:54,271
- Who are you?
- Shut up! Just go!

1122
01:32:57,649 --> 01:33:00,402
Slow down!
Slow down!

1123
01:33:00,486 --> 01:33:02,696
What's with you? Huh?

1124
01:33:04,573 --> 01:33:07,201
Yes, yes.
I know exactly where it is.

1125
01:33:07,284 --> 01:33:08,911
We are on our way.

1126
01:33:08,994 --> 01:33:11,997
What are you doing!
You're driving!

1127
01:33:52,454 --> 01:33:55,582
- June!
- Yes!

1128
01:33:56,959 --> 01:34:00,295
- June!
- Yes! High five!

1129
01:34:01,380 --> 01:34:04,299
Chun-seob!
You made it!

1130
01:34:04,550 --> 01:34:06,385
I thought you guys werent coming.

1131
01:34:09,888 --> 01:34:11,181
Good job.

1132
01:34:18,230 --> 01:34:21,650
- Give me your M.R. First!
- M. R?

1133
01:34:21,733 --> 01:34:24,152
You're not scheduled to sing with the band.

1134
01:34:24,236 --> 01:34:26,029
You didn't bring your sheet music?

1135
01:34:29,032 --> 01:34:31,952
Well, you have instruments
on the stage, right?

1136
01:34:32,035 --> 01:34:34,037
Then we can do it!

1137
01:34:34,121 --> 01:34:35,247
Okay?
We can do it, right?

1138
01:34:35,330 --> 01:34:36,665
- Yeah!
- Yeah! We can do it.

1139
01:34:36,748 --> 01:34:37,958
See! I told you!

1140
01:34:38,041 --> 01:34:39,960
I told you June couldn't do it without us.

1141
01:34:40,085 --> 01:34:42,421
Please hurry to the stage
and begin tuning up.

1142
01:34:45,841 --> 01:34:47,175
Hey, Maya!

1143
01:35:01,773 --> 01:35:02,983
Good luck!

1144
01:35:03,650 --> 01:35:06,695
I mean, let's rock this!

1145
01:35:14,077 --> 01:35:16,955
That's right!
Let's rock this!

1146
01:35:44,316 --> 01:35:45,609
You'll be here.
Right... sir?

1147
01:35:48,445 --> 01:35:50,781
Calling me sir?

1148
01:35:55,035 --> 01:35:59,373
Rosie was asking if we can take
a family trip this Christmas.

1149
01:36:23,522 --> 01:36:24,731
June!

1150
01:36:31,613 --> 01:36:35,534
Don't take your eyes off the male judge

1151
01:36:36,034 --> 01:36:39,454
and make sure you smile
every 10 seconds. Okay?

1152
01:36:40,414 --> 01:36:41,665
Fightint!

1153
01:36:52,634 --> 01:36:54,469
Yeah! Let's go!

1154
01:37:03,854 --> 01:37:05,981
What's going on?
Why are there kids up there?

1155
01:37:08,066 --> 01:37:09,985
- Come on. You can do it.
- I'm not sure.

1156
01:37:10,068 --> 01:37:11,486
Maya...

1157
01:37:50,108 --> 01:37:52,360
It's okay for the kids to be up there?

1158
01:37:54,738 --> 01:37:57,574
<i>And if you get your heart broken girl</i>

1159
01:37:57,616 --> 01:37:59,743
<i>Oh I promise it'll be okay</i>

1160
01:38:01,536 --> 01:38:06,374
<i>You better listen up my baby,</i>
<i>I got something to say</i>

1161
01:38:08,460 --> 01:38:11,755
<i>You know it's gon'be good, so come on now</i>

1162
01:38:11,838 --> 01:38:15,300
<i>It's time to rock and roll.</i>

1163
01:38:15,801 --> 01:38:20,430
<i>Let the music enter your soul!</i>

1164
01:38:20,472 --> 01:38:23,100
<i>Feels good, just like I knew that it would</i>

1165
01:38:23,183 --> 01:38:25,727
<i>Let go of the fear continue</i>

1166
01:38:25,811 --> 01:38:28,313
<i>Just let it rock and roll come on</i>

1167
01:38:29,981 --> 01:38:32,609
<i>I'm here I'll never leave you</i>

1168
01:38:32,692 --> 01:38:35,028
<i>Let the light within you shine on!</i>

1169
01:38:36,905 --> 01:38:39,241
<i>It's now or never love</i>

1170
01:38:39,324 --> 01:38:41,952
<i>won't you let it take you over, come on!</i>

1171
01:38:43,703 --> 01:38:46,456
<i>And let your voice be heard now</i>

1172
01:38:46,498 --> 01:38:48,750
<i>the beauty of what you can do</i>

1173
01:38:49,501 --> 01:38:52,129
<i>Let the music take control of you.</i>

1174
01:38:52,921 --> 01:38:55,632
<i>Let the music take control</i>

1175
01:38:55,841 --> 01:39:01,847
<i>Take over your soul.</i>

1176
01:39:10,355 --> 01:39:12,566
<i>Pump up the music yeah!</i>

1177
01:39:12,649 --> 01:39:14,401
<i>Don't listen to a sayin'!</i>

1178
01:39:14,484 --> 01:39:16,695
<i>Listen to how feel, turn the music up high,</i>

1179
01:39:16,778 --> 01:39:17,988
<i>and scream and shout!</i>

1180
01:39:18,071 --> 01:39:19,531
<i>Close your eyes to the clock!</i>

1181
01:39:19,573 --> 01:39:21,199
<i>Listen to your true soul!</i>

1182
01:39:21,283 --> 01:39:22,784
<i>Let the music gain control!</i>

1183
01:39:22,868 --> 01:39:23,827
<i>That's how you rock and roll!</i>

1184
01:39:23,869 --> 01:39:28,623
<i>You better listen up my baby</i>
<i>I got something to say</i>

1185
01:39:32,085 --> 01:39:34,838
- Exciting stuff!
- Oh, hello, sir!

1186
01:39:34,880 --> 01:39:37,424
I didn't know you'd be here.
I was looking for you!

1187
01:39:37,883 --> 01:39:40,844
- My kids are good, huh?
- Yes, they are.

1188
01:39:42,095 --> 01:39:43,346
She's amazing!

1189
01:39:45,390 --> 01:39:48,018
<i>Let go, don't let fear contain you</i>

1190
01:39:48,101 --> 01:39:50,437
<i>Just let it rock 'n roll, come on</i>

1191
01:39:52,230 --> 01:39:55,066
<i>I'm here.</i>
<i>I will never leave you</i>

1192
01:39:55,233 --> 01:39:57,235
<i>Let the light within you shine on</i>

1193
01:39:59,237 --> 01:40:01,448
<i>It's now or never love</i>

1194
01:40:01,531 --> 01:40:04,159
<i>Won't you let it take you over, come on</i>

1195
01:40:05,911 --> 01:40:08,246
<i>And let your voice be heard now</i>

1196
01:40:08,330 --> 01:40:10,957
we'll have to include
the kids in the contract.

1197
01:40:14,753 --> 01:40:15,420
Thank you! Thank you!

1198
01:40:15,503 --> 01:40:19,549
<i>Let the music take control</i>
<i>Take over your soul.</i>

1199
01:40:33,438 --> 01:40:36,399
<i>Let go, don't let fear contain you</i>

1200
01:40:36,441 --> 01:40:38,276
<i>Just let it rock 'n roll, come on</i>

1201
01:40:38,360 --> 01:40:39,486
Here you are, you punk!

1202
01:40:39,569 --> 01:40:43,198
- Hey, hey, hey, hey!
- Excuse me! Excuse me!

1203
01:40:49,454 --> 01:40:50,497
SHIN!

1204
01:40:50,580 --> 01:40:53,583
You wanna be buried here?

1205
01:40:53,667 --> 01:40:57,629
How dare you sign up two contracts?

1206
01:41:01,883 --> 01:41:03,510
That's enough!
That's enough!

1207
01:41:03,593 --> 01:41:06,012
Okay, Okay...

1208
01:41:06,096 --> 01:41:11,726
June already contract me!
Okay? You know?

1209
01:41:12,102 --> 01:41:16,564
Bastard SHIN here?
He's a con! A crook!

1210
01:41:17,732 --> 01:41:20,652
A bad boy! Bad boy!

1211
01:41:20,735 --> 01:41:23,071
Bad boy! Bad boy!

1212
01:41:24,155 --> 01:41:25,448
Don't.

1213
01:41:27,242 --> 01:41:28,451
Let's talk.

1214
01:41:29,244 --> 01:41:31,663
What?
What did he say?

1215
01:41:32,747 --> 01:41:34,165
- You Korean?
- Enough!

1216
01:41:34,249 --> 01:41:37,168
Yang-moo, you idiot!

1217
01:41:37,252 --> 01:41:41,256
He's right.

1218
01:41:41,339 --> 01:41:45,093
As June's legal guardian

1219
01:41:45,176 --> 01:41:48,471
I signed her contract
with Mr. Dough here.

1220
01:41:48,555 --> 01:41:50,390
It's a nonsense contract,

1221
01:41:50,473 --> 01:41:52,475
but still a contract.

1222
01:41:52,559 --> 01:41:56,021
Sir, could you please translate?

1223
01:41:56,563 --> 01:41:57,897
Make it long this time.

1224
01:41:57,981 --> 01:41:59,983
He wants me to translate something for him.

1225
01:42:00,066 --> 01:42:07,066
I became June's legal guardian
on October 11th last year

1226
01:42:10,076 --> 01:42:14,748
when I married June's mom,

1227
01:42:14,831 --> 01:42:16,333
OH Mi-young.

1228
01:42:22,130 --> 01:42:23,965
But that was a fake marriage.

1229
01:42:25,133 --> 01:42:28,178
I gave her $5000 for the marriage.

1230
01:42:28,219 --> 01:42:30,555
- Really?
- Really what? What?

1231
01:42:30,638 --> 01:42:32,766
He paid five thousand dollars
for a false marriage.

1232
01:42:40,857 --> 01:42:42,484
I'm not a dad.

1233
01:42:47,572 --> 01:42:51,868
I'm not June's dad.

1234
01:42:53,870 --> 01:42:58,583
Therefore, the contract
I signed as a fake guardian,

1235
01:42:59,584 --> 01:43:02,212
- is invalid.
- I need a unit out here immediately.

1236
01:43:02,253 --> 01:43:03,797
Look, I don't know how
the situation is gonna turn out,

1237
01:43:03,880 --> 01:43:05,298
so I need some muscle.

1238
01:43:06,257 --> 01:43:07,592
I don't give a damn where they are!

1239
01:43:07,675 --> 01:43:09,594
I need them out here now!

1240
01:43:09,677 --> 01:43:11,679
So now, June's free.

1241
01:43:14,599 --> 01:43:21,599
Because she has no relations
with me whatsoever

1242
01:43:22,524 --> 01:43:28,238
she's completely free from now

1243
01:43:30,323 --> 01:43:34,869
To sign her own contract
with whoever she pleases.

1244
01:43:36,454 --> 01:43:40,083
SHIN!
You little!

1245
01:43:40,125 --> 01:43:43,753
And if...

1246
01:43:43,837 --> 01:43:50,837
If anyone ever lays a hand on
my June about the contract

1247
01:43:56,266 --> 01:43:58,476
I'll take care of that.

1248
01:43:59,477 --> 01:44:05,191
I'll take claim for any legal
disadvantages she might face.

1249
01:44:06,276 --> 01:44:12,699
You're setting yourself on fire!

1250
01:44:12,782 --> 01:44:14,951
I guess I'll be visiting you in the hole.

1251
01:44:16,327 --> 01:44:21,541
Stay alive til you get out
of jail, you idiot!

1252
01:44:23,001 --> 01:44:24,752
Okay.
Don't worry.

1253
01:44:26,838 --> 01:44:28,131
Get my jacket!

1254
01:44:30,633 --> 01:44:32,260
You asshole!

1255
01:45:00,538 --> 01:45:01,873
You did good.

1256
01:45:05,251 --> 01:45:08,213
Yeah? Good. Good.

1257
01:45:44,624 --> 01:45:46,251
Very good.

1258
01:45:53,424 --> 01:45:55,009
Yeah, right!

1259
01:45:56,636 --> 01:45:59,180
- That's the end?
- You're joking!

1260
01:45:59,264 --> 01:46:01,766
So did she become famous?

1261
01:46:01,849 --> 01:46:03,184
You're falling for this?

1262
01:46:03,268 --> 01:46:06,271
Then you should be looking for her!

1263
01:46:06,354 --> 01:46:10,275
If she's famous, she's like
a winning lottery ticket!

1264
01:46:13,361 --> 01:46:18,533
You'd never know what
it's like to be a parent.

1265
01:46:19,284 --> 01:46:22,745
You're so cool, Mr. SHIN!
Nice comment!

1266
01:46:22,787 --> 01:46:26,040
You'd never find her.
It's been too long!

1267
01:46:26,124 --> 01:46:26,749
You trust him too?

1268
01:46:26,791 --> 01:46:29,252
Wanna search for her together?

1269
01:46:30,128 --> 01:46:32,755
We'll split 5:5.
6:4!

1270
01:46:34,132 --> 01:46:36,134
7:3. No less!

1271
01:46:36,217 --> 01:46:37,844
Calm down!

1272
01:46:40,513 --> 01:46:43,558
Damn it!

1273
01:46:43,641 --> 01:46:45,852
Where the hell is he?

1274
01:46:47,645 --> 01:46:49,063
I don't have time for this!

1275
01:46:50,732 --> 01:46:55,153
Hey! SHIN!
SHIN!

1276
01:46:55,236 --> 01:46:59,073
- Sorry, bro!
- See the time?

1277
01:46:59,157 --> 01:47:02,368
We're gonna be late!

1278
01:47:02,452 --> 01:47:03,870
Look, man!

1279
01:47:03,953 --> 01:47:06,080
You know there's traffic today!

1280
01:47:06,164 --> 01:47:07,874
You should've gotten the car ready.

1281
01:47:07,957 --> 01:47:10,668
You just had to slack off, huh?

1282
01:47:21,804 --> 01:47:26,434
Bro, I think it's gonna snow.

1283
01:47:53,711 --> 01:47:55,463
What the?

1284
01:47:57,048 --> 01:47:58,758
What's this?

1285
01:47:59,550 --> 01:48:00,343
Mr. SUH?

1286
01:48:00,426 --> 01:48:02,553
Why weren't you picking up your phone?

1287
01:48:02,637 --> 01:48:05,848
You know who came by the office today?

1288
01:48:05,932 --> 01:48:09,394
The girl you always talk about
whenever you get drunk!

1289
01:48:09,435 --> 01:48:10,770
Look!

1290
01:49:32,602 --> 01:49:35,730
Twins! Yeah!

1291
01:49:42,612 --> 01:49:44,447
Twins! Yeah!

1292
01:50:14,143 --> 01:50:16,771
I told you it's her!

1293
01:51:12,201 --> 01:51:13,536
Papa!

1294
01:51:14,745 --> 01:51:16,247
Happy Christmas!

1295
01:51:36,934 --> 01:51:41,564
Thank you! Thank you!

1296
01:51:56,871 --> 01:51:58,080
Thank you!

1297
01:52:00,082 --> 01:52:01,292
Thank you!

1298
01:52:12,470 --> 01:52:14,847
Thank you! Thank you!

1299
01:52:20,519 --> 01:52:22,063
Thank you!

1300
01:52:28,319 --> 01:52:29,779
Thank you!

1301
01:52:54,845 --> 01:52:58,683
And if...

1302
01:52:58,766 --> 01:53:04,480
If anyone ever lays a hand on my June...

1303
01:53:05,356 --> 01:53:08,609
Look, man.
That's not mine.

1304
01:53:09,276 --> 01:53:12,697
I don't do drugs, okay?

1305
01:53:14,198 --> 01:53:16,450
This can cause a serious
breach in Korea-US relations.

1306
01:53:16,534 --> 01:53:19,829
You're ignoring me <i>cuz</i> I'm colored?

1307
01:53:19,912 --> 01:53:21,831
This is a violation of human rights!
