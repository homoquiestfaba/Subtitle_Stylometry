That's enough! That's enough!

My ass is on fire!

[laughing]

19
00:03:21,233 --> 00:03:22,333
I thought I smelled

20
00:03:22,334 --> 00:03:23,433
some nuts roasting.

[whimpering]

22
00:03:27,067 --> 00:03:28,833
Call it, Sparks.

23
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:30,576
- This is Little John
- who shot the sheriff.

24
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,800
- [sighs]
- First weapons test terminated.

25
00:03:32,867 --> 00:03:34,500
Back up all telemetry

26
00:03:34,501 --> 00:03:36,133
and crash reference data.

27
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,700
Nice shootin', Johnny.

28
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:40,833
- Thanks, Sparky.

29
00:03:40,834 --> 00:03:42,333
- 'It feels good, though.'

30
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,743
- Moving the capacitor
- to the start

31
00:03:43,767 --> 00:03:45,167
- Really helped fix
- the balance.

32
00:03:45,233 --> 00:03:46,700
- Always glad to help.

33
00:03:46,701 --> 00:03:48,167
- And whose idea was that?

[helicopter whirring]

35
00:03:49,867 --> 00:03:50,984
Let's, uh, take

36
00:03:50,985 --> 00:03:52,100
a closer look, senator.

37
00:03:52,167 --> 00:03:53,700
- Bring that video over here,
- Burke.

38
00:03:53,767 --> 00:03:55,067
- On it, sir.

39
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:56,367
- 'Oh, alright.'

40
00:03:56,433 --> 00:03:58,533
[helicopter whirring]

41
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,733
How's the voltage holding?

42
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,634
Solid.

43
00:04:01,635 --> 00:04:03,467
Still got 57.2 megavolts.

44
00:04:03,533 --> 00:04:05,133
Check the amp-curve.

45
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,133
It's perfect.

46
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,700
You knew alloy

47
00:04:08,701 --> 00:04:10,200
really kept the barrel cool.

48
00:04:10,267 --> 00:04:11,700
Cool, just like you.

49
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:14,243

- 'Okay, I'll back up.'

displays? Everything okay?

53
00:04:17,551 --> 00:04:18,667
Now, what about the data

54
00:04:18,733 --> 00:04:20,300
- (John)
- 'Yeah, it's great.'

55
00:04:22,533 --> 00:04:23,567
Impressive, isn't it?

56
00:04:23,633 --> 00:04:24,767
[sighs]

57
00:04:24,768 --> 00:04:25,900
It's amazing weaponry.

58
00:04:25,967 --> 00:04:28,167
This was maximum power?

59
00:04:28,233 --> 00:04:30,433
Is that what you were told?

60
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,700
Forgive my asking, ma'am.

61
00:04:32,767 --> 00:04:34,050
Uh, what's your

62
00:04:34,051 --> 00:04:35,333
security clearance?

63
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,533
Level four.

64
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,076
- Well, then I guess it's alright
- for me to tell you

65
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:41,809
- That I've personally made
- some adjustments

66
00:04:41,833 --> 00:04:43,533
That increase

67
00:04:43,534 --> 00:04:45,233
the intensity considerably.

68
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,000
- That would be
- something to see.

69
00:04:47,067 --> 00:04:49,067
Always doing my best in the

70
00:04:47,067 --> 00:04:51,067
ma'am.

71
00:04:49,068 --> 00:04:51,067
service of my country,

72
00:04:51,133 --> 00:04:53,200
Well..

73
00:04:53,267 --> 00:04:54,347
- Keep it up,
- lieutenant..

74
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,100
Nathaniel Burke, ma'am.

75
00:04:57,167 --> 00:04:59,100
- Keep this up,
- Lieutenant Nathaniel Burke

76
00:04:59,167 --> 00:05:00,300
And you'll be a captain

77
00:05:00,301 --> 00:05:01,433
in no time.

78
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,233
Yes, ma'am.

79
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:04,443
- (David)
- 'Senator Nolan, we're ready'

80
00:05:04,467 --> 00:05:06,433
'for the next demonstration.'

81
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:10,350
This village

82
00:05:10,351 --> 00:05:11,400
has been set aside for us

83
00:05:11,467 --> 00:05:12,900
as a training area.

84
00:05:12,967 --> 00:05:14,433
- (female #1)
- 'Ammo! Ammo!'

85
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,067
This isn't, uh,

86
00:05:16,068 --> 00:05:17,633
people's rifle.

87
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:19,300
- No, ma'am,
- it's a sonic cannon.

88
00:05:19,367 --> 00:05:20,887
- It pumps out
- an ultra-low-frequency

89
00:05:20,933 --> 00:05:22,067
Burst of sound energy.

90
00:05:22,133 --> 00:05:23,867
- Can take out
- a whole line of troops.

91
00:05:23,933 --> 00:05:25,217
Without killing them.

92
00:05:25,218 --> 00:05:26,500
Just leaves them stunned.

93
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,400
And you like that idea?

94
00:05:29,467 --> 00:05:30,684
Not killing 'em?

95
00:05:30,685 --> 00:05:31,900
Yes, ma'am, I do.

96
00:05:31,967 --> 00:05:33,609
- Set to a higher gain,
- it can bring down

97
00:05:33,633 --> 00:05:36,133
An entire wall like that one.

98
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,133
Why not the whole building?

99
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,284
We haven't tested

100
00:05:39,285 --> 00:05:40,367
those parameters.

101
00:05:41,533 --> 00:05:43,800
- Everything's set on the street.
- Let's do it.

102
00:05:43,867 --> 00:05:44,917
(male #2)

103
00:05:44,918 --> 00:05:45,967
'Go, go, go, go.'

104
00:05:46,033 --> 00:05:47,250
This is Little John.

105
00:05:47,251 --> 00:05:48,467
Get ready to storm the castle.

106
00:05:48,533 --> 00:05:49,809
- (man on radio)
- 'Copy that, Little John.'

107
00:05:49,833 --> 00:05:51,667
May I do the honors, colonel?

108
00:05:51,733 --> 00:05:53,400
- 'Evacuate the area! Let's

109
00:05:51,733 --> 00:05:55,067
- Alright. Irons, stand down.

110
00:05:53,401 --> 00:05:55,067
go!'

111
00:05:55,133 --> 00:05:56,767
- (man on radio)
- 'Target in sight..'

112
00:05:56,833 --> 00:05:58,400
- Go for it, lieutenant.

113
00:05:58,401 --> 00:05:59,967
- Yes, sir.

114
00:06:00,033 --> 00:06:01,100

Nathaniel, no!

[Susan screams]

122
00:06:28,533 --> 00:06:29,867
Sparky!

00:06:39,267 --> 00:06:43,833
Sparky!

00:06:49,567 --> 00:06:52,633
[grunting]

130
00:06:58,367 --> 00:06:59,450
When you managed

131
00:06:59,451 --> 00:07:00,533
to remove the concrete

132
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,300
what did you find?

133
00:07:02,367 --> 00:07:03,534
The senator

134
00:07:03,535 --> 00:07:04,700
had been killed, sir.

135
00:07:04,767 --> 00:07:06,733
And Lieutenant Sparks?

136
00:07:08,367 --> 00:07:09,634
<i>(John)</i>

137
00:07:09,635 --> 00:07:10,900
<i>She had a severe spinal injury.</i>

138
00:07:10,967 --> 00:07:13,567
And her legs had been crushed.

139
00:07:13,633 --> 00:07:16,667
She may never walk again.

140
00:07:16,733 --> 00:07:18,200
I can imagine how difficult

141
00:07:18,201 --> 00:07:19,667
it must have been for you.

142
00:07:21,767 --> 00:07:23,576
- Now, we've heard the testimony
- that you shouted out

143
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,850
To Lieutenant Burke

144
00:07:24,851 --> 00:07:26,100
just before he fired.

145
00:07:26,167 --> 00:07:27,334
Did you see how the weapon

146
00:07:27,335 --> 00:07:28,500
was calibrated?

147
00:07:28,567 --> 00:07:29,833
Yes, sir.

148
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:32,567
What intensity level was set?

149
00:07:32,633 --> 00:07:34,100
The maximum, sir.

150
00:07:34,167 --> 00:07:36,100
- A parameter that had
- never been tested

151
00:07:36,167 --> 00:07:37,784
Or even approved for testing,

152
00:07:37,785 --> 00:07:39,400
is that correct?

153
00:07:39,467 --> 00:07:40,900
Yes, sir.

154
00:07:40,901 --> 00:07:42,333
Burke knew what he was doing.

155
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,267
Oh, is it?

156
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:46,833
Who recalibrated the weapon?

157
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:49,267
Lieutenant, who did it?

158
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:50,567
Burke did it, sir.

159
00:07:50,633 --> 00:07:51,933
[indistinct chatter]

160
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,234
(male #4)

161
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,467
That's all.'

162
00:07:53,235 --> 00:07:54,467
'Thank you, lieutenant.

163
00:07:54,533 --> 00:07:56,533
- Thanks for selling me out,
- brother soldier.

164
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,950
Out of my face with that.

165
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:59,300
What you did was foul.

166
00:07:59,367 --> 00:08:00,534
I should bust your ass

167
00:08:00,535 --> 00:08:01,700
for what you did to Sparky.

168
00:08:01,767 --> 00:08:03,234
Bust my ass?

169
00:08:03,235 --> 00:08:04,700
Do you know where I was headed?

170
00:08:04,767 --> 00:08:06,617
You know what I could've done

171
00:08:04,767 --> 00:08:08,467
resources?

172
00:08:06,618 --> 00:08:08,467
with those military

173
00:08:08,533 --> 00:08:10,833
You stupid..

174
00:08:15,167 --> 00:08:16,634
- Ugh! Ah.

175
00:08:16,635 --> 00:08:18,100
- Huh. Hey, man.

176
00:08:18,167 --> 00:08:19,967
<i>- (David) - He's lucky
- He just got dismissed</i>

177
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,334
Instead of being sent

178
00:08:21,335 --> 00:08:22,667
to Leavenworth.

179
00:08:22,733 --> 00:08:24,709
- It's been a rotten damn deal
- all the way around

180
00:08:24,733 --> 00:08:26,343
- But you're gonna feel
- a whole lot better about this

181
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:27,733
When we go back to work.

182
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,081
- Now, we've got to create
- a new unit here and press on.

183
00:08:30,133 --> 00:08:31,467
We got a golden

184
00:08:31,468 --> 00:08:32,800
opportunity here.

185
00:08:32,867 --> 00:08:33,933
"Opportunity?"

186
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,034
These weapons

187
00:08:35,035 --> 00:08:36,067
are far more powerful

188
00:08:36,133 --> 00:08:37,067
than I'd ever hoped.

189
00:08:37,133 --> 00:08:38,567
Come on, you still have those

190
00:08:38,633 --> 00:08:39,733

No time to breathe.

Keep going.

1327
00:52:02,901 --> 00:52:04,467

1328
00:52:06,067 --> 00:52:08,100
What? Geez.

- 'Johnny, a-are you..'

1344
00:52:48,435 --> 00:52:50,167
- Just a little trashed.

1345
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:56,176
- I guess I better do
- some more work

1346
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:58,233
On the tensile strength.

1347
00:52:58,300 --> 00:52:59,833
That's a good idea.

1348
00:52:59,900 --> 00:53:02,467

I see it. Hang on.

1361
00:53:40,551 --> 00:53:42,167
I'm working on it.

- "Uh-oh?"

1370
00:54:02,633 --> 00:54:04,967
I don't wanna hear "Uh-oh!"

1371
00:54:05,033 --> 00:54:06,617

We're not cool. Sparky!

1376
00:54:16,633 --> 00:54:18,333
It ain't easy being green.

There.

Oh, Lord,

I'm getting too old for this.

1380
00:54:32,333 --> 00:54:34,633
This should close the door.

Yes.

What, what, what?

since the Mets won the series

I ain't felt this good

1423

- Man..
- That was a long time ago.

1427
00:57:01,300 --> 00:57:03,467
- When that wire pulled me up,
- my heart dropped.

1428
00:57:03,533 --> 00:57:04,533
Yeah, and when it broke,

1429
00:57:04,534 --> 00:57:05,534
my heart stopped.

1430
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:06,900
Work in progress. Did you see

1431
00:57:06,901 --> 00:57:08,200
the look on those kids' faces?

1432
00:57:08,267 --> 00:57:10,243
- [chuckles] - Looked like they found
- Their Jesus.

- Trust my rangefinder
- before you jump?

- Boy, you sure are lucky
- this is stainless

1436
00:57:15,867 --> 00:57:16,884
Otherwise your butt

1437
00:57:16,885 --> 00:57:17,900
would be rusted.

1438
00:57:17,967 --> 00:57:19,943
- I've got a printout coming
- so that we can evaluate

1439

1448
00:57:45,300 --> 00:57:47,350

doing, like, 80.

1450
00:57:49,467 --> 00:57:50,700
Morning, Martin.

- Fly.

1457
00:57:59,867 --> 00:58:01,627
- Why don't you and I
- go take a look at it?

1458
00:58:01,667 --> 00:58:02,933
Alright, cool.

1459
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:04,633
- So you really saw
- that man of..

1460
00:58:04,700 --> 00:58:06,300
Yeah, steel. Heh.

1461
00:58:06,367 --> 00:58:07,500
Last night.

1462
00:58:07,501 --> 00:58:08,633
He got some skills.

1463
00:58:08,700 --> 00:58:09,867
- And he's a brother.

1464
00:58:09,868 --> 00:58:11,033
- Really?

1465
00:58:11,100 --> 00:58:12,576
- You think
- he's from your neighborhood?

1466
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:14,309
- Well, he damn sure
- ain't from Beverly Hills.

1467
00:58:14,333 --> 00:58:15,733
Mm. Where exactly

1468
00:58:15,734 --> 00:58:17,133
is your neighborhood?

1469
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:19,767
[indistinct]

1470
00:58:19,833 --> 00:58:21,917
He, he's an

00:58:24,067 --> 00:58:25,150
- Yes. Very big.

1474
00:58:25,151 --> 00:58:26,233
- As big as a mountain.

1475
00:58:26,300 --> 00:58:27,684

steel.'

1478
00:58:29,133 --> 00:58:30,483
And he returned

1479
00:58:30,484 --> 00:58:31,833
all of our belongings. See?

1480
00:58:31,900 --> 00:58:33,900
And he was,

1481
00:58:33,901 --> 00:58:35,900
he was extremely polite.

1482
00:58:35,967 --> 00:58:37,234
(male #10)

1483
00:58:37,235 --> 00:58:38,500
'Yeah, he was amazing.'

1484
00:58:38,567 --> 00:58:40,309
- Wait up for me.
- Why are you going so fast?

1485
00:58:40,333 --> 00:58:41,550

What up, lieutenant?

1488
00:58:44,667 --> 00:58:46,567
Nice chain. Subtle.

1491
00:58:48,733 --> 00:58:50,676
- Now, what's wrong
- with a little flossing, man?

1492
00:58:50,700 --> 00:58:52,634
You floss too much, man,

1493
00:58:52,635 --> 00:58:54,567
and your gums are bleeding.

1494
00:58:54,633 --> 00:58:55,850
Maybe you'll end up

1495
00:58:55,851 --> 00:58:57,067
just like Cutter.

1496
00:59:04,233 --> 00:59:05,433
Hot dog?

1497
00:59:06,733 --> 00:59:08,300
I don't eat no pork mess.

1498
00:59:08,367 --> 00:59:09,567
- That's turkey mess.

1499
00:59:09,568 --> 00:59:10,767
- Word?

1500
00:59:10,833 --> 00:59:12,533
- Singer will pick
- you guys upstate

1501
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:15,033
Precisely on the schedule.

1502
00:59:15,100 --> 00:59:16,600
- How much we give him
- broke off?

1503
00:59:16,667 --> 00:59:18,517
A lot. Now, what do you know

1504
00:59:18,518 --> 00:59:20,367
about this Steel guy?

1505
00:59:20,433 --> 00:59:21,967
Come on, some crazy-ass fool

1506
00:59:21,968 --> 00:59:23,500
runnin' around

1507
00:59:23,567 --> 00:59:26,000
in aluminum foil.

1508
00:59:26,067 --> 00:59:27,134
Sound like a tin man

1509
00:59:27,135 --> 00:59:28,200
on steroid.

1510
00:59:28,267 --> 00:59:29,900
Never underestimate

1511
00:59:29,901 --> 00:59:31,533
your enemy.

1512
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:33,233
- And keep your gold
- out of sight.

1513
00:59:33,300 --> 00:59:34,717
Eat the hot dog,

1514
00:59:34,718 --> 00:59:36,133
don't be one.

1515
00:59:40,233 --> 00:59:41,700
Yes, sir.

1516
00:59:52,033 --> 00:59:53,517
(Susan)

1517
00:59:52,033 --> 00:59:55,000
no sign of those weapons.

1518
00:59:53,518 --> 00:59:55,000
Five nights, and still

1519
00:59:55,067 --> 00:59:56,300
I mean, don't get me wrong,

1520
00:59:56,301 --> 00:59:57,533
I like having the time

1521
00:59:57,600 --> 00:59:59,367
- to make improvements
- on my chair, but..

1522
00:59:59,433 --> 01:00:00,933
Stay on point, Sparky.

1523
01:00:00,934 --> 01:00:02,433
Something's gonna pop.

1524
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:08,633

1529
01:00:50,700 --> 01:00:52,600
Alright.

1530
01:00:52,667 --> 01:00:55,700
[music continues]

1531
01:00:57,467 --> 01:00:58,600
Yeah.

[beeping]

1536
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:17,633
Heads up. Something's cooking.

1537
01:01:17,700 --> 01:01:18,834
The emergency services

1538
01:01:18,835 --> 01:01:19,967

1539
01:01:20,033 --> 01:01:21,550
major telephone and power

1540
01:01:21,551 --> 01:01:23,067
failure near Hope And Wilshire.

1541
01:01:23,133 --> 01:01:25,467
We'll check it out.

1542
01:01:25,533 --> 01:01:27,967
I'm zeroing in the land sat.

1543
01:01:28,033 --> 01:01:29,433
See if our eye in the sky

1544
01:01:29,434 --> 01:01:30,833
spots anything.

1545
01:01:30,900 --> 01:01:32,067
Time to make

1546
01:01:32,068 --> 01:01:33,233
our major infomercial.

Shielded sideband,

1559
01:01:53,118 --> 01:01:54,133
do you read now?

1560
01:01:54,200 --> 01:01:55,617
I read you, five by five.

1561
01:01:55,618 --> 01:01:57,033
What happened?

1562
01:01:57,100 --> 01:01:58,734
Jamming. Police frequencies

1563
01:01:58,735 --> 01:02:00,367
are out, too.

1564
01:02:00,433 --> 01:02:02,300
Something is going down.

1565
01:02:02,367 --> 01:02:03,933
We're on it.

Proceed.

1569
01:02:23,700 --> 01:02:25,250
This is papa bear.

1570
01:02:25,251 --> 01:02:26,800
Go. Go.

Oh, my God.

- (John)
- 'What is it? What's there?'

1576
01:02:44,700 --> 01:02:46,867
Only the city's biggest ATM.

1577
01:02:46,933 --> 01:02:48,317
- 'What?'

1578
01:02:48,318 --> 01:02:49,700
- The Federal Reserve.

- 'Throw it open.'

1588
01:03:10,667 --> 01:03:12,034

1589
01:03:12,035 --> 01:03:13,400

Keep pushing. Keep piling, baby.

01:03:52,767 --> 01:03:54,133
Let's go. Let's go.

01:04:00,785 --> 01:04:02,067
- Oh, no..

1612
01:04:02,133 --> 01:04:03,483
- Is he okay?

1613
01:04:03,484 --> 01:04:04,833
- Oh, come on!

1614
01:04:04,900 --> 01:04:07,600

1617
01:04:12,700 --> 01:04:14,134
Now I wonder

1618
01:04:14,135 --> 01:04:15,567
who that could be.

1619
01:04:17,467 --> 01:04:19,034
- Give it up!

1620
01:04:19,035 --> 01:04:20,600

- Go outside.

1623

- You're too far away
- to use the magnet.

1626
01:04:31,933 --> 01:04:33,350
The alloy of those guns

1627
01:04:33,351 --> 01:04:34,767
is not magnetic.

1628
01:04:34,833 --> 01:04:36,833
Who's he talking to?

1629
01:04:36,900 --> 01:04:38,367
I'm scanning for it, sir.

just like yours, Johnny.

1636
01:04:56,900 --> 01:04:58,334
- 'What's that?'

1637
01:04:58,335 --> 01:04:59,767
- Yo, it's tear gas, man.

1638
01:04:59,833 --> 01:05:01,467
Yeah. Come on. Let's-let's go.

1639
01:05:01,533 --> 01:05:02,550

- Come on, let's go!

1641
01:05:06,133 --> 01:05:07,867
You're about to get the blues.

1642
01:05:07,933 --> 01:05:09,533

Get the sonic gun.

Come on, get some of this.

1647
01:05:22,267 --> 01:05:23,350
Take this guy out, man.

1648
01:05:23,351 --> 01:05:24,433
Come on.

1649
01:05:25,467 --> 01:05:26,633
Whoa!

It's him again.

1658
01:05:56,285 --> 01:05:57,767
Try to call it in.

1660
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,167
Alright, let's get your hands

1661

down, down.

1662
01:06:14,167 --> 01:06:15,600
Perfect.

1663
01:06:17,100 --> 01:06:20,200
Baby Bear, do the chopper.

1664
01:06:20,267 --> 01:06:21,400
Slats got something

[siren wailing]

1681
01:07:47,933 --> 01:07:51,100
Uh, Johnny, he's closing on you.

1685
01:08:18,267 --> 01:08:20,176
- Hang in there, Johnny.
- Okay, keep going straight.

1686
01:08:20,200 --> 01:08:22,867
You'll see the rabbit hole.

1687
01:08:22,933 --> 01:08:24,217
'I know you're hurting.

1688
01:08:24,218 --> 01:08:25,500
You can make it.'

01:08:39,300 --> 01:08:40,517
He stopped transmitting

1691
01:08:40,518 --> 01:08:41,733
before I could triangulate.

1692
01:08:41,800 --> 01:08:43,067
'But I got some parameters.'

1693
01:08:43,133 --> 01:08:45,900
Good. Find his home base.

1694
01:08:45,967 --> 01:08:47,334
And transmit those video

1695
01:08:45,967 --> 01:08:48,700
to the TV stations.

1696
01:08:47,335 --> 01:08:48,700

01:08:48,767 --> 01:08:50,000
Mm-hmm.

- Moments ago'

'from the LA Federal Reserve.'

'And it's the second time..'

1701
01:08:56,667 --> 01:08:58,367
I want some of them weapons.

1702
01:08:58,433 --> 01:09:00,200
- Yeah.
- Alright.

<i>Pronto.</i>

1712
01:09:21,500 --> 01:09:22,700
Oh, my God.

1713
01:09:22,767 --> 01:09:24,133
- You may be steel
- on the outside

1714
01:09:24,200 --> 01:09:26,100
- But you're flesh and blood
- on the inside.

1715
01:09:26,167 --> 01:09:28,100
- Oh, the boy gonna be
- just fine.

1716
01:09:28,167 --> 01:09:29,633
- It's just a scratch.
- I'm alright.

1717
01:09:29,700 --> 01:09:31,300
Will you cut the macho bull?

1718
01:09:31,301 --> 01:09:32,900
You know your rib is broken.

1719
01:09:32,967 --> 01:09:34,234
Well, that's tough going,

1720
01:09:34,235 --> 01:09:35,500
no question.

1721
01:09:35,567 --> 01:09:37,976
- But it's just like what the old
- John Henry had to go through.

1722
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:39,840
- Yeah, and we all know
- what happened to him.

1723
01:09:39,900 --> 01:09:41,376
- He died pounding steel,
- but at least

1724
01:09:41,400 --> 01:09:42,643
- He beat that old steam
- drill.

1725
01:09:42,667 --> 01:09:44,433
But he died doing it.

1726
01:09:44,500 --> 01:09:45,617
Well, I guess I can't argue

1727
01:09:45,618 --> 01:09:46,733
with you on that.

1728
01:09:46,800 --> 01:09:48,967
- Of course, now,
- he didn't have you to help him.

1729
01:09:49,033 --> 01:09:50,473
- That's got nothing
- to do with it.

1730
01:09:50,533 --> 01:09:51,609
- Of course, it does.
- Looky here...

1731
01:09:51,633 --> 01:09:53,133
- Can I have some water,
- please?

1732
01:09:53,200 --> 01:09:54,633
Water?

1733
01:09:58,467 --> 01:10:00,467
You don't have to do this.

1734
01:10:00,533 --> 01:10:02,017
- They got a warrant out for me?

1735
01:10:02,018 --> 01:10:03,500
- For the man in steel.

1736
01:10:03,567 --> 01:10:04,867
Some of the cops think that

1737
01:10:04,868 --> 01:10:06,167
you're all part of the same gang

1738
01:10:06,233 --> 01:10:07,283
because you all use

1739
01:10:07,284 --> 01:10:08,333
the same weapons.

1740
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:09,750
Somehow they got videotapes

1741
01:10:09,751 --> 01:10:11,100
of the robbery.

1742
01:10:13,400 --> 01:10:14,867
I think

1743
01:10:13,400 --> 01:10:16,333
this.

1744
01:10:14,868 --> 01:10:16,333
Nathaniel's mixed up in

1745
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:17,717
I gotta get those weapons

1746
01:10:17,718 --> 01:10:19,033
off the streets.

1747
01:10:20,433 --> 01:10:21,683
What you've gotta do

1748
01:10:21,684 --> 01:10:22,933
is get some sleep.

1749
01:10:24,867 --> 01:10:28,033
[telephone ringing]

1750
01:10:28,100 --> 01:10:29,134
Rampard Division.

1751
01:10:29,135 --> 01:10:30,167
Officer Craft.

1752
01:10:30,233 --> 01:10:31,333
Good evening, officer.

1753
01:10:31,400 --> 01:10:32,709
- Would you like to know
- where to find

1754
01:10:32,733 --> 01:10:34,383
The fancy weapon that shot down

1755
01:10:34,384 --> 01:10:36,033
your helicopter?

1756
01:10:43,900 --> 01:10:45,400
[siren wailing]

1757
01:10:58,033 --> 01:11:00,267
You are really leaning on him.

1758
01:11:02,600 --> 01:11:03,867
I noticed at the mill that

1759
01:11:03,933 --> 01:11:05,467
the iron that goes through

1760
01:11:05,468 --> 01:11:07,000
the hottest fire

1761
01:11:07,067 --> 01:11:08,867
makes the best quality steel

1762
01:11:08,868 --> 01:11:10,667
on the other end.

1763
01:11:10,733 --> 01:11:13,000
Well, if it ever gets that far.

1764
01:11:13,067 --> 01:11:14,234
Why are you pressing him

1765
01:11:14,235 --> 01:11:15,400
so hard?

1766
01:11:15,467 --> 01:11:17,333
'Cause I love him..

1767
01:11:19,233 --> 01:11:22,600
And what he's trying to do.

1768
01:11:22,667 --> 01:11:25,333
Same reason I love you, Sparky.

1769
01:11:40,433 --> 01:11:42,167
- [whispers]
- Evening.

1770
01:11:43,133 --> 01:11:44,400
<i>Souffle?</i>

1771
01:11:44,467 --> 01:11:45,634
I'mma get it right

1772
01:11:45,635 --> 01:11:46,800
if it kills me.

1773
01:11:48,200 --> 01:11:49,484
What did you do

1774
01:11:49,485 --> 01:11:50,767
to your chin, son?

1775
01:11:50,833 --> 01:11:52,550
Oh, I, uh,

1776
01:11:52,551 --> 01:11:54,267
bumped into something.

1777
01:11:54,333 --> 01:11:55,833
So you did.

1778
01:11:58,000 --> 01:11:59,767
You see any of that

1779
01:11:59,768 --> 01:12:01,533
big old robbery stuff on TV?

1780
01:12:02,500 --> 01:12:04,167
On TV?

1781
01:12:04,967 --> 01:12:06,300
No, ma'am.

1782
01:12:09,167 --> 01:12:11,933
Times is hard on the street.

1783
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:13,550
Everybody feel like they got

1784
01:12:13,551 --> 01:12:15,100
this big old black cloud

1785
01:12:15,167 --> 01:12:16,900
hanging over 'em.

1786
01:12:16,967 --> 01:12:19,017
Only hope seems to be

1787
01:12:19,018 --> 01:12:21,067
that Steel boy.

1788
01:12:25,033 --> 01:12:26,550
[chuckles]

1789
01:12:26,551 --> 01:12:28,067
Here's a long drink of water.

1790
01:12:28,133 --> 01:12:32,233
Big, tall. Like you.

1791
01:12:33,800 --> 01:12:35,284
Kinda tired. I think

1792
01:12:35,285 --> 01:12:36,767
I'm gonna get some sleep.

1793
01:12:36,833 --> 01:12:38,117
What's that in your ear,

1794
01:12:38,118 --> 01:12:39,400
son?

1795
01:12:39,467 --> 01:12:42,633
It's a, it's a hearing aid.

1796
01:12:42,700 --> 01:12:43,734
You never had

1797
01:12:43,735 --> 01:12:44,767
no hearing problem.

1798
01:12:44,833 --> 01:12:46,417
- Huh?

1799
01:12:46,418 --> 01:12:48,000
- I said you never had..

1800
01:12:49,467 --> 01:12:51,500
Don't you play with me, boy.

1801
01:12:53,700 --> 01:12:55,400
Now, I want to know

1802
01:12:55,401 --> 01:12:57,100
the truth.

1803
01:13:00,033 --> 01:13:01,267

Ah!

- Get on the ground,
- get on the ground

1811
01:13:22,433 --> 01:13:24,100
- And put your hands
- on your head.

1812

- Now!
- Grandma, what's going on?

- (John)
- I'm down, I'm down!

01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:28,967
This is a search warrant.

1815
01:13:29,033 --> 01:13:30,700
- John Henry Irons,
- you're under arrest

1816
01:13:30,767 --> 01:13:32,800
- 'for suspicion
- of armed robbery, assault'

1817
01:13:32,867 --> 01:13:34,209
- 'and possession
- of illegal weapons.'

1818
01:13:34,233 --> 01:13:37,033
What's he talking about, Johnny?

1819
01:13:37,100 --> 01:13:38,800
- Sir, this was in the basement.

1820
01:13:38,801 --> 01:13:40,500
- 'Yeah.'

1821
01:13:40,567 --> 01:13:42,076
- Yeah, he definitely fits
- the description.

1822
01:13:42,100 --> 01:13:43,300
For what?

1823
01:13:43,367 --> 01:13:46,500
To be the man they call Steel.

1824
01:13:46,567 --> 01:13:48,076
- You have the right
- to remain silent.

1825
01:13:48,100 --> 01:13:50,180
- Anything you say
- can and will be used against you

1826
01:13:50,233 --> 01:13:51,867
'in the court of law.'

1827
01:13:51,933 --> 01:13:53,967
Number one, step forward.

1828
01:13:55,967 --> 01:13:57,267
- Not tall enough.

1829
01:13:57,268 --> 01:13:58,567
- No.

1830
01:13:58,633 --> 01:14:00,367
- Number two,
- front and center.

1831
01:14:00,433 --> 01:14:02,150
Got it, man. I always wanted

1832
01:14:02,151 --> 01:14:03,867
to be course line.

1833
01:14:03,933 --> 01:14:05,000
Put a sock in it, number

1834
01:14:05,001 --> 01:14:06,067
two.

1835
01:14:06,133 --> 01:14:07,500
You know, detective,

1836
01:14:07,501 --> 01:14:08,867
he was very kind to us.

1837
01:14:08,933 --> 01:14:10,076
We wouldn't wanna do anything...

1838
01:14:10,100 --> 01:14:11,233
I know, ma'am.

1839
01:14:11,300 --> 01:14:12,767
But serious crimes

1840
01:14:12,768 --> 01:14:14,233
were committed.

1841
01:14:14,300 --> 01:14:15,567
- 'Well, two's not big enough.'

1842
01:14:15,568 --> 01:14:16,833
- No.

1843
01:14:18,300 --> 01:14:20,333
Officer, the man who helped us

1844
01:14:20,400 --> 01:14:22,033
- was on the right side
- of the law.

1845
01:14:22,100 --> 01:14:23,333
Yeah.

1846
01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:26,333
'And, uh..'

1847
01:14:29,733 --> 01:14:31,083
- He's not up there.

1848
01:14:31,084 --> 01:14:32,433
- No.

01:14:33,667 --> 01:14:34,933
No.

1850
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:36,617
Alright, thanks for

1851
01:14:36,618 --> 01:14:38,233
coming in.

1852
01:14:38,300 --> 01:14:40,034
- Marcus, come here.

1853
01:14:40,035 --> 01:14:41,767
- Yeah.

1854
01:14:41,833 --> 01:14:42,933
You got a good look at him,

1855
01:14:42,934 --> 01:14:44,033
right?

1856
01:14:44,100 --> 01:14:45,343
- Well, look,
- it was kind of dark.

1857
01:14:45,367 --> 01:14:46,933
- I mean...
- Hey!

1858
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,200
Get in there and ID him.

Were sent anonymously.

1872
01:15:56,433 --> 01:15:57,967
Big-time infomercial.

Of course.

But now the bad news.

- The big auction is going down
- in 11 hours.

1888

- Not till the last minute.

Hey, call that detective for me!

1890
01:16:30,267 --> 01:16:32,217
Or what? Did you get tired

1891
01:16:32,218 --> 01:16:34,167
of talking to the trees?

1892
01:16:34,233 --> 01:16:36,383
He's gone to lunch.

1893
01:16:36,384 --> 01:16:38,533
Save it for the army, fruitcake.

1894
01:16:41,700 --> 01:16:43,467
- He's not gonna be
- that much help.

1895
01:16:43,533 --> 01:16:45,200
- Sparky,
- I need to get out of here.

1896
01:16:45,267 --> 01:16:47,233
We got you covered.

01:21:41,933 --> 01:21:44,033
But unfortunately, these weapons

2044
01:21:44,100 --> 01:21:45,567
are highly-sophisticated

2045
01:21:45,568 --> 01:21:47,033
electronic devices

2046
01:21:47,100 --> 01:21:48,234
'which require

2047
01:21:48,235 --> 01:21:49,367
specialized maintenance'

2048
01:21:49,433 --> 01:21:52,567
and recharging.

2049
01:21:54,900 --> 01:21:57,400
And only I can do that for you.

2050
01:21:57,467 --> 01:21:59,000
Only we.

2051
01:21:59,067 --> 01:22:00,733
[gunshot]

2052
01:22:03,067 --> 01:22:04,900
Only I.

2053
01:22:06,867 --> 01:22:08,533
That's blackmail.

2054
01:22:08,600 --> 01:22:09,733
That's business.

2055
01:22:09,800 --> 01:22:10,917
- How much?

2056
01:22:10,918 --> 01:22:12,033
- Millions.

2057
01:22:12,100 --> 01:22:13,900
You don't need our money.

2058
01:22:13,901 --> 01:22:15,700
You can steal all you want.

2059
01:22:15,767 --> 01:22:16,984
Uh, this isn't really

2060
01:22:16,985 --> 01:22:18,200
about money.

2061
01:22:18,267 --> 01:22:20,234
(Weston)

2062
01:22:18,267 --> 01:22:22,200
arm supplier to the world.

2063
01:22:20,235 --> 01:22:22,200
You'll be the illegal

2064
01:22:22,267 --> 01:22:24,100
You want power.

2065
01:22:24,167 --> 01:22:25,833
Now, there's an idea.

2066
01:22:27,100 --> 01:22:29,700
You gentleman think about this.

2067
01:22:29,767 --> 01:22:31,243
- Do you really wanna be
- the only ones

2068
01:22:31,267 --> 01:22:33,100
Without my kind of fire power

2069
01:22:33,167 --> 01:22:34,984
'when the rest of these

2070
01:22:33,167 --> 01:22:36,800
III?'

2071
01:22:34,985 --> 01:22:36,800
nice folks start World War

2072
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:39,533
But before you answer that..

2073
01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:42,233
Get him out of here.

2074
01:22:42,300 --> 01:22:44,050
Let me give you that

2075
01:22:44,051 --> 01:22:45,800
little demonstration I promised.

2076
01:22:47,267 --> 01:22:49,767
You remember that bank mobile..

2077
01:22:50,833 --> 01:22:52,633
- '...and the boys in the
- 'hood..'

2078
01:22:52,700 --> 01:22:54,100
[laughs]

2079
01:22:54,167 --> 01:22:55,584
who have served their purpose

2080
01:22:55,585 --> 01:22:57,000
incidentally.

2081
01:22:59,333 --> 01:23:00,533
Ay, what's up with this,

2082
01:23:00,534 --> 01:23:01,733
lieutenant?

2083
01:23:01,800 --> 01:23:03,534
I always use rats

2084
01:23:03,535 --> 01:23:05,267
for the preliminary testing.

2085
01:23:05,333 --> 01:23:06,733
Oh, and, uh, Slats,

2086
01:23:06,734 --> 01:23:08,133
the hot dog..

2087
01:23:08,200 --> 01:23:09,417
- It was pork.

2088
01:23:09,418 --> 01:23:10,633
- Kick your ass..

2089
01:23:10,700 --> 01:23:11,867
[gunshot]

2090
01:23:11,933 --> 01:23:12,933
- Oh!
- Whoa!

2091
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:14,350
- 'Watch it.'

2092
01:23:14,351 --> 01:23:15,700
- 'Hey, mate.'

2093
01:23:15,767 --> 01:23:17,417
Sparky, you read me?

2094
01:23:17,418 --> 01:23:19,067
Damn, we in deep stink here!

2095
01:23:19,133 --> 01:23:21,283
Got that right. Step away

2096
01:23:21,284 --> 01:23:23,433
from the truck, old man.

2097
01:23:23,500 --> 01:23:26,633
Damn. Damn! Damn! Damn!

2098
01:23:29,967 --> 01:23:30,967
You don't know

2099
01:23:29,967 --> 01:23:31,967
you?

2100
01:23:30,968 --> 01:23:31,967
who you messing with, do

2101
01:23:32,033 --> 01:23:34,000
- Come here, Lilly.
- Yes.

2102
01:23:34,067 --> 01:23:35,600
Yes. I owe you a big stake,

2103
01:23:35,601 --> 01:23:37,133
Lilly.

2104
01:23:37,200 --> 01:23:38,476
- (Nathaniel)
- 'Keep him quiet over there.'

2105
01:23:38,500 --> 01:23:39,567
'Okay, you've seen how

2106
01:23:39,568 --> 01:23:40,633
powerful'

2107
01:23:40,700 --> 01:23:42,300
these weapons are.

2108
01:23:42,367 --> 01:23:43,417
But, gentleman, now I have

2109
01:23:43,418 --> 01:23:44,467
developed a new weapon

2110
01:23:44,533 --> 01:23:46,300
- that is five times
- more powerful.

2111
01:23:46,367 --> 01:23:48,200
- (John)
- 'Only five times?'

2112
01:23:49,533 --> 01:23:51,467
- What do you got?
- A water pistol.

2113
01:23:51,533 --> 01:23:52,850
My hammer's got

2114
01:23:52,851 --> 01:23:54,167
more juice than that.

2115
01:23:54,233 --> 01:23:56,100
I find that hard to believe.

2116
01:23:56,167 --> 01:23:58,484
See for yourselves. I'll let

2117
01:23:58,485 --> 01:24:00,800
my hammer speak for itself.

2118
01:24:00,867 --> 01:24:01,984
Just hit it right there

2119
01:24:01,985 --> 01:24:03,100
on the bottom.

2120
01:24:09,433 --> 01:24:12,600
Don't turn the red switch.

2121
01:24:12,667 --> 01:24:14,200
She'll get too hot for you.

2122
01:24:14,267 --> 01:24:16,867
Really? We'll see about that.

2123
01:24:16,933 --> 01:24:18,350
I was planning to use you

2124
01:24:18,351 --> 01:24:19,767
as a demonstration, anyway.

2125
01:24:19,833 --> 01:24:21,550
Killing two birds

2126
01:24:21,551 --> 01:24:23,267
with one stone, as they say.

2127
01:24:23,333 --> 01:24:24,717
- Move it, y'all!

2128
01:24:24,718 --> 01:24:26,100
- Come on, come on! Go, go!

2129
01:24:26,167 --> 01:24:29,200
[dramatic music]

2130
01:24:30,667 --> 01:24:32,300
We're airborne.

2131
01:24:35,700 --> 01:24:36,867
Be there in 15!

2132
01:24:36,933 --> 01:24:38,083
Yeah, well, I hope

2133
01:24:38,084 --> 01:24:39,233
you make it in time.

2134
01:24:44,067 --> 01:24:46,200
They'll never make it.

2135
01:24:46,267 --> 01:24:48,200
- If he kills me,
- you'll all lose out.

2136
01:24:48,267 --> 01:24:50,550
We don't need your help anymore,

2137
01:24:50,551 --> 01:24:52,833
except as a target.

[groaning]

2139
01:24:54,767 --> 01:24:56,433
The red switch.

2140
01:25:01,867 --> 01:25:03,300
Well, you know

2141
01:25:03,301 --> 01:25:04,733
I've got to push the envelope.

2142
01:25:07,767 --> 01:25:09,267

01:25:11,333 --> 01:25:13,267
Yeah, I know you do.

2145
01:25:13,333 --> 01:25:14,583
- Kill him!

2146
01:25:14,584 --> 01:25:15,833
- Maybe not.

[explosion]

2157
01:25:55,333 --> 01:25:56,933
Just get out of here quick.

2158
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:58,067
This quick enough?

Get out! Get out!

Nathaniel, give it up!

First let's see

what's behind door number two!

2176
01:26:53,667 --> 01:26:54,834
- My new best friend!

2177
01:26:54,835 --> 01:26:56,000
- Let me go!

2178
01:26:56,067 --> 01:26:58,033
You understand, Johnny?

2179
01:26:58,100 --> 01:27:00,033
- Success has never
- been enough for me.

'I need to see my enemy

- So why don't you just
- back off?

2183
01:27:04,900 --> 01:27:06,867
- Martin and I are gonna take
- a little ride.

2184
01:27:06,933 --> 01:27:08,100

Oh, hey, bend your knees

2198
01:27:37,385 --> 01:27:39,167

Mr. Steel, let's see how

01:28:13,084 --> 01:28:14,933
your armor stands up to this.

Uncle Joe, here, here I am.
