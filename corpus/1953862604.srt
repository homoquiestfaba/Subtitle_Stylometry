00:00:00,633 --> 00:00:02,167
¶ We have

00:00:02,202 --> 00:00:03,802
         <i>¶ Say what? </i>

3
00:00:03,837 --> 00:00:05,754
         <i>¶ A whole lot</i>
     <i>of superstars ¶</i>

4
00:00:05,789 --> 00:00:08,090
     <i>¶ On this stage</i>
         <i>here tonight ¶</i>

5
00:00:08,124 --> 00:00:10,876
       <i>¶ But I want y'all</i>
      <i>to know one thing ¶</i>

6
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:13,212
      <i>¶ This is my house </i>

7
00:00:13,246 --> 00:00:15,264
       <i>¶ And when I say,</i>
     <i>"Whose house?" ¶</i>

8
00:00:15,298 --> 00:00:16,932
          <i>¶ Y'all know</i>
       <i>what time it is ¶</i>

9
00:00:16,966 --> 00:00:19,218
     <i>¶ Whose house? </i>

10
00:00:19,252 --> 00:00:21,720
     <i>¶ Run's house </i>

11
00:00:21,754 --> 00:00:24,256
 <i>¶ Once again, my friend,</i>
     <i>not a trend for then ¶</i>

12
00:00:24,274 --> 00:00:26,725
   <i>¶ They said rap was crap,</i>
   <i>but never had this band ¶</i>

13
00:00:26,759 --> 00:00:29,061
     <i>¶ Till the ruler came</i>
      <i>with a cooler name ¶</i>

14
00:00:29,095 --> 00:00:31,563
  <i>¶ Made you dance and prance</i>
  <i>and drove the fans insane ¶</i>

15
00:00:31,597 --> 00:00:33,866
     <i>¶ Name is Run, my son,</i>
      <i>number one for fun ¶</i>

16
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:36,285
 <i>¶ Not a gun that's done</i>
     <i>and get done by none ¶</i>

17
00:00:36,319 --> 00:00:38,404
   <i>¶ The other act, in fact,</i>
     <i>is just whack I kill ¶</i>

18
00:00:38,438 --> 00:00:41,240
- <i>¶ Why? </i>
- <i>¶ It's fun, my son,</i>
 <i> and Run heads the bill ¶</i>

19
00:00:41,274 --> 00:00:43,208
     <i>¶ Whose house? </i>

20
00:00:43,243 --> 00:00:44,877
     <i>¶ Run's house. </i>

21
00:00:44,911 --> 00:00:47,179
      <i>( people cheering )</i>

22
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:49,782
       <i>( music playing )</i>

23
00:00:49,816 --> 00:00:52,451
          <i>( applause )</i>

24
00:01:06,833 --> 00:01:11,036
        Nat King Cole:
      <i>¶ There was a boy </i>

25
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:15,574
       <i>¶ A very strange,</i>
     <i>enchanted boy ¶</i>

26
00:01:15,608 --> 00:01:19,845
     <i>¶ They say he wandered</i>
           <i>very far ¶</i>

27
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:21,947
          <i>¶ Very far </i>

28
00:01:21,981 --> 00:01:25,451
     <i>¶ Over land and sea </i>

29
00:01:28,354 --> 00:01:33,492
     <i>¶ A little shy </i>

30
00:01:33,526 --> 00:01:38,330
       <i>¶ And sad of eye </i>

31
00:01:38,364 --> 00:01:43,068
       <i>¶ But very wise </i>

32
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:46,772
           <i>¶ Was he </i>

33
00:01:48,808 --> 00:01:52,811
      <i>¶ And then one day </i>

34
00:01:52,846 --> 00:01:57,783
         <i>¶ A magic day</i>
       <i>he passed my way ¶</i>

35
00:01:57,817 --> 00:02:01,954
      <i>¶ And while we spoke</i>
     <i>of many things ¶</i>

36
00:02:01,988 --> 00:02:04,857
      <i>¶ Fools and kings </i>

37
00:02:04,891 --> 00:02:08,827
     <i>¶ This he said to me </i>

38
00:02:11,664 --> 00:02:16,101
     <i>¶ The greatest thing </i>

39
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:21,106
     <i>¶ You'll ever learn </i>

40
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:25,010
      <i>¶ Is just to love </i>

41
00:02:25,044 --> 00:02:29,148
     <i>¶ And be loved </i>

42
00:02:29,182 --> 00:02:33,018
         <i>¶ In return. </i>

43
00:02:37,757 --> 00:02:40,192
      <i>( strobes popping )</i>

44
00:02:43,029 --> 00:02:46,064
     Thank you for coming
    out tonight and welcome
      to my living room.

45
00:02:46,082 --> 00:02:48,784
         ( applause )

46
00:02:52,205 --> 00:02:54,122
    This is gonna be
         interesting.

47
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:56,091
 This is gonna be a fun night,
          I can see.

48
00:02:56,125 --> 00:02:57,593
      I know many of you
    are probably wondering,

49
00:02:57,627 --> 00:02:58,844
        "What the hell
    is Mike Tyson gonna do

50
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:00,629
        up here onstage
    tonight," right?

51
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,965
  And, frankly, I'm wondering
     the same thing, too.

52
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:06,718
         As you know,
      the name of my show
  is "The Undisputed Truth."

53
00:03:06,752 --> 00:03:09,271
      I personally wanted
          to name it

54
00:03:09,305 --> 00:03:11,590
    "Boxing, Bitches,
 and Lawsuits-- Plus a Baby."

55
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:14,109
        You know?

56
00:03:14,143 --> 00:03:16,928
But my wife and attorney,
    they absolutely freaked

57
00:03:16,946 --> 00:03:18,780
    and I couldn't go
        that way.

58
00:03:18,815 --> 00:03:20,199
        But, you know,
        life is great.

59
00:03:20,233 --> 00:03:21,900
      You know, I really
  can't complain these days.

60
00:03:21,934 --> 00:03:24,903
    I'm just very grateful
    that life has come full
        circle for me.

61
00:03:24,937 --> 00:03:26,989
Many of you may remember
          I'm the guy

62
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,625
      that used to knock
motherfuckers out in less
    than 30 seconds.

63
00:03:29,659 --> 00:03:32,110
         ( cheering )

64
00:03:35,615 --> 00:03:37,299
          Thank you.

65
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:39,501
 And I'll knock a motherfucker
    out tonight, too,

66
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:41,920
     if shit get out of--
         I'm kidding.

67
00:03:43,006 --> 00:03:45,390
No, I'm domesticated now
          with kids.

68
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:49,177
        Lawsuits.

69
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:52,814
    But now I'm here
    in New York City.
         My hometown.

70
00:03:52,849 --> 00:03:55,851
    At the Imperial Theatre
     to entertain you all.

71
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:59,571
    I actually did my show
 here on Broadway last summer
      for the first time.

72
00:03:59,606 --> 00:04:03,108
 Many people thought this was
  my first time on Broadway,
        but it wasn't.

73
00:04:03,142 --> 00:04:05,994
  I actually got arrested on
  this same block right here.

74
00:04:06,029 --> 00:04:09,314
    Many years ago, though.
        Many years ago.

75
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:12,918
      I like to say that
    arrest was one of those
defining moments for me.

76
00:04:12,952 --> 00:04:15,287
  If I hadn't gotten arrested
on that particular night,

77
00:04:15,321 --> 00:04:18,823
     I wouldn't have went
to that Spofford Juvenile
    Detention Center.

78
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:20,459
      And if I never went
to that detention center,

79
00:04:20,493 --> 00:04:21,493
      I would never have
        met my mentor.

80
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:23,045
If I never met my mentor,
          of course,

81
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:25,047
         I would never
    have been the youngest
     heavyweight champion

82
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:27,849
  - in the history of boxing.
  - ( cheering )

83
00:04:29,135 --> 00:04:31,169
                That's true.

84
00:04:32,221 --> 00:04:33,772
So I really have to thank

85
00:04:33,806 --> 00:04:35,557
that really nice New York City
        police officer

86
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:39,678
that was kind enough to arrest
  that badass black kid from
     Brooklyn, of course.

87
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:42,531
         But New York
    has changed a lot, huh?

88
00:04:42,565 --> 00:04:45,317
     Especially this whole
  Broadway-Times Square area.

89
00:04:45,351 --> 00:04:47,786
    Like Disney World
up in this motherfucker.

90
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:50,822
        I remember when
it looked like a war zone

91
00:04:50,856 --> 00:04:53,075
for drug addicts, pimps,
    and prostitutes.

92
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:55,460
 You know, Koch was the mayor
    then, of course.

93
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:58,080
And I couldn't walk down
          the street

94
00:04:58,131 --> 00:04:59,881
    without a pervert
    flashing his dick at me

95
00:04:59,916 --> 00:05:01,416
      or somebody trying
     to sell me something.

96
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:03,001
     <i>Wanted that shit</i>
      <i>and didn't even buy.</i>

97
00:05:03,035 --> 00:05:05,704
     And this neighborhood
became a prime robbing location

98
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:07,539
            for me
and my Brownsville crew.

99
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:09,708
 Brownsville's in this house.
    I know they have to be.

100
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:11,893
          <i>( cheering )</i>

101
00:05:11,928 --> 00:05:14,396
    That'd be fucking
          real, huh?

102
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:16,515
I did this show so you'd better
understand me, of course.

103
00:05:16,549 --> 00:05:18,100
    In my own words.

104
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:19,818
    You may have seen
    that documentary I did

105
00:05:19,852 --> 00:05:21,653
      with my good friend
     Jim Toback, "Tyson."

106
00:05:21,688 --> 00:05:24,573
         We won a few
awards and we kicked ass
 at the Cannes Film Festival.

107
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:28,110
    But to be honest,
      that was some real
    dark shit, right?

108
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:30,829
    I was filming it
    straight out of rehab,
    so what did you expect?

109
00:05:30,863 --> 00:05:32,397
    I still had that stuff
         in my system

110
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:34,065
     and I'm coming at you
    full speed ahead.

111
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:37,035
  But tonight, I'm promising
     to be a lot lighter,

112
00:05:37,069 --> 00:05:39,121
      like my personality
          these days.

113
00:05:41,207 --> 00:05:43,241
         And, listen,
    all jokes aside,

114
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:45,844
    I don't know what
    you're gonna take away
 from this experience tonight,

115
00:05:45,878 --> 00:05:49,748
     but to simply put it,
    this is my story.

116
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:52,417
  My mistakes, my heartaches,
      my joy, my sorrow,

117
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:55,137
    my gift, my life,
     my undisputed truth.

118
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:56,471
    Let's get this popping.

119
00:05:56,522 --> 00:06:00,025
      - <i>( music playing )</i>
      - ( cheering )

120
00:06:11,287 --> 00:06:12,904
         This is fun.

121
00:06:12,938 --> 00:06:14,990
We got Red Hook up there.
    Brooklyn Heights.

122
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:17,242
    Carroll Gardens.

123
00:06:17,276 --> 00:06:20,212
    But this is where
  it all started right here,

124
00:06:20,246 --> 00:06:22,664
        June 30, 1966,
      the day I was born

125
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:26,051
    in Cumberland Hospital
 in the republic of Brooklyn,
        New York.

126
00:06:26,085 --> 00:06:29,337
    It's the same hospital
where ballers Bernard and
    Albert King were born,

127
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:31,757
    and the legendary
        Michael Jordan.
          Right here.

128
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:34,125
        In Fort Greene.
        Oh, fuck.

129
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:36,678
      This is fucked up.

130
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:40,816
    This is supposed to be
me and my mother up here.

131
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:42,768
    Listen, come on,

132
00:06:42,802 --> 00:06:44,636
there's no baby pictures
of Mike Tyson floating around,

133
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:47,189
     but God damn, Spike.

134
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,474
  You couldn't find a picture
    of a nice black mother

135
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:51,142
    holding a child?

136
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,744
     That's really fucked.

137
00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:55,146
         I'm taking it
on the chin, guys, okay?

138
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:57,165
             Wow.
     This is much better.

139
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,617
         This is where
    it really begun.

140
00:06:58,651 --> 00:07:01,369
  Right here with this woman,
  my mother, Lorna May Tyson.

141
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:04,289
         ( cheering )

142
00:07:04,323 --> 00:07:06,875
    A simple Southern woman
from the Charlottesville,
        Virginia, area

143
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:09,261
      that moved up north
     and tried to live out
          her dreams

144
00:07:09,295 --> 00:07:10,679
that never came to form.

145
00:07:10,713 --> 00:07:12,631
      I was the youngest
      of three children.

146
00:07:12,665 --> 00:07:14,382
    My brother Rodney
     and my sister Denise,

147
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:16,184
        they were more
        like my mother.

148
00:07:16,219 --> 00:07:19,104
         I always felt
    like the odd guy,
    the black sheep.

149
00:07:21,023 --> 00:07:22,607
        Ooh, ooh, ooh.
And this guy right here,

150
00:07:22,642 --> 00:07:26,144
    this is my father
    Curly Lee Kirkpatrick.

151
00:07:26,178 --> 00:07:27,512
        Wait a minute.

152
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:30,115
Now, if Curly Kirkpatrick
 is supposed to be my father,

153
00:07:30,149 --> 00:07:33,685
    then who the fuck
      is this dude on my
      birth certificate?

154
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:36,988
    This is where the shit
  gets really tricky, right?

155
00:07:37,022 --> 00:07:38,857
             So...

156
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:42,694
        listen to this.
  My mom said Curly's my dad,

157
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:45,547
but Percel fucking Tyson
 is on the birth certificate.

158
00:07:45,581 --> 00:07:48,166
     How did this happen?
  No wonder I'm so fucked up.

159
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,969
    Here's the early proof.

160
00:07:51,003 --> 00:07:54,172
I'm still not sure who the hell
     my father really is.

161
00:07:54,206 --> 00:07:55,974
      Curly was the pimp.

162
00:07:56,008 --> 00:07:59,377
You know, Percel was the humble
     Jamaican cab driver.

163
00:08:00,763 --> 00:08:02,731
        A sucker.

164
00:08:02,765 --> 00:08:04,816
 I so desperately wanted to be
      the son of the pimp

165
00:08:04,851 --> 00:08:06,885
         because in my
 neighborhood of Brownsville,
     that carries weight.

166
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:09,654
So if Curly really wasn't
          my father,

167
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:11,273
    him and my mother
must have made some deal

168
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:12,991
    that once a year
        you come around

169
00:08:13,025 --> 00:08:15,277
    and show your manhood,
    show fatherhood.

170
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:16,895
And this is what he'd do.
    He'd come around.

171
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:18,663
     He always had a nice
     Cadillac, of course.

172
00:08:18,698 --> 00:08:20,749
     And he'd come around,
        beep the horn.

173
00:08:20,783 --> 00:08:22,400
          Boop, boop.

174
00:08:22,418 --> 00:08:24,419
 "Oh, God, Daddy's downstairs.
Look at his car, Daddy."

175
00:08:24,453 --> 00:08:26,738
        "Get down here,
  you little motherfuckers!"

176
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:29,908
      And so, of course,
      we'd get in the car
        happy, excited,

177
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:31,510
    thinking we're gonna go
     to some exotic place

178
00:08:31,544 --> 00:08:33,461
      like Coney Island.

179
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:36,515
    Or Bear Mountain.

180
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:39,217
    But, you know, that was
  some good shit when you're
    broke back in the day.

181
00:08:39,251 --> 00:08:41,853
         That was some
    real good shit, right?
 Especially from Brownsville.

182
00:08:41,888 --> 00:08:44,556
    Don't be talking
      like y'all are some
fly niggas all your life.

183
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:46,691
      You know, it's like
        going to Paris.

184
00:08:46,726 --> 00:08:48,810
     But anyway, right...

185
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:51,530
     to our sad surprise,
      five minutes later,

186
00:08:51,564 --> 00:08:53,648
he'd go around the block,
     he drops us back off.

187
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:55,934
     Five dollars richer,
          of course.

188
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:58,954
  I don't know why we thought
 each year would be different.

189
00:09:00,439 --> 00:09:03,074
 You know, I really don't know
     much about my mother.

190
00:09:03,108 --> 00:09:05,210
    I remember her drinking
    a lot and always angry

191
00:09:05,244 --> 00:09:06,578
         and fighting.

192
00:09:06,612 --> 00:09:09,130
     I knew she had dreams
 of becoming a schoolteacher.

193
00:09:09,165 --> 00:09:10,949
        But then
      she met my father--

194
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:12,918
well, the man I was told
        was my father.

195
00:09:12,952 --> 00:09:14,786
    The fast-talking,
      cool-dressing pimp

196
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:17,622
     who I always credited
    with changing the path
     of my mother's life.

197
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:20,592
    And before long,
    she was caught up
      in the street life.

198
00:09:20,626 --> 00:09:22,060
         But she paid
        the heavy toll

199
00:09:22,094 --> 00:09:24,646
    because at heart
    she really wasn't
    that girl at all.

200
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:27,298
         So she drank
     to cover up the pain.

201
00:09:27,316 --> 00:09:30,185
  And I suppose my addictions
    started here with her.

202
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:32,187
        See, I was born
    with the addictive gene

203
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:33,805
    and it still haunts me
         to this day.

204
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:35,974
    Ready to creep up on me
     in my darkest night.

205
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:39,411
        Ready to rob me
     of my brightest day.

206
00:09:39,445 --> 00:09:41,913
    You know, this is
    the only picture I have
of my mother, Lorna May.

207
00:09:41,948 --> 00:09:43,114
     But it's a good one.

208
00:09:43,148 --> 00:09:45,584
She seemed like she must
have been happy that day.

209
00:09:45,618 --> 00:09:47,953
         I wish I knew
        more about her.

210
00:09:47,987 --> 00:09:49,454
          I know when
    she took this picture,

211
00:09:49,488 --> 00:09:51,673
  she never imagined her boy
would make it out of Brownsville

212
00:09:51,707 --> 00:09:54,626
    unless I did it in some
  handcuffs or a wooden box.

213
00:09:56,178 --> 00:09:58,129
    You know, I didn't come
  from a place where memories

214
00:09:58,163 --> 00:10:01,182
  are cherished and displayed
proudly in a photo album.

215
00:10:01,217 --> 00:10:02,550
    I came from the gutter.

216
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:03,969
     A place where dreams
          are broken

217
00:10:04,003 --> 00:10:05,804
         and memories
      are best forgotten.

218
00:10:05,838 --> 00:10:07,555
    Welcome to Brownsville.

219
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:10,058
         Our motto is
  "never run and never will."

220
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:11,810
      <i>As a matter of fact,</i>
 <i>right here is my block.</i>

221
00:10:11,844 --> 00:10:13,845
       <i>178 Amboy Street.</i>

222
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:16,231
     - Anybody know
       where that's at?
     - <i>( cheering )</i>

223
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:20,118
        My memories are
  of this place right, well--

224
00:10:20,152 --> 00:10:22,988
     well, not this place.
      I don't remember it
      looking like this.

225
00:10:23,022 --> 00:10:26,741
  I remember broken windows,
        graffiti,

226
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:29,127
dog shit on the sidewalk.

227
00:10:29,161 --> 00:10:31,413
         "A tree grows
     in Brooklyn," my ass.

228
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:33,965
            Spike--
     Spike shot this shit

229
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,800
      a few weeks before
    our Broadway run.

230
00:10:35,835 --> 00:10:38,870
 But now there's white people
     in the neighborhood,

231
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:41,172
         as you know,
    the Whole Foods.

232
00:10:41,206 --> 00:10:44,042
And you know, once those
     white people move in,

233
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,877
          there goes
    the neighborhood.

234
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:48,179
        They will lock
         your ass up.

235
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:52,383
     At that time leaving
    Bed-Stuy, "do or die,"

236
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:54,319
    moving to Brownsville,
"never ran, never will,"

237
00:10:54,353 --> 00:10:56,071
    it was equivalent
     to being born in hell

238
00:10:56,105 --> 00:10:57,689
      and then the devil
    took you and moved you

239
00:10:57,723 --> 00:11:00,191
        into his toilet
      where he could shit
    on you real good.

240
00:11:00,225 --> 00:11:02,243
    And that's what he did
     to me and my family.

241
00:11:02,278 --> 00:11:03,912
    I can still see myself
        and my friends

242
00:11:03,946 --> 00:11:05,997
  roaming the streets at all
  hours of the day and night.

243
00:11:06,032 --> 00:11:08,066
        And I hung out
  with a tough crew of kids.

244
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:10,418
     But my street friends
  were my family, of course.

245
00:11:10,453 --> 00:11:12,837
    And we all knew no one
  was gonna give us anything.

246
00:11:12,872 --> 00:11:14,572
We knew if we wanted anything,
      we had to take it.

247
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:16,875
          And that's
      what we did a lot.

248
00:11:16,909 --> 00:11:18,910
    I'm 10 years old
          right here.

249
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:21,713
      <i>I remember I scored</i>
   <i>a couple of hundred bucks</i>
      <i>on a robbing spree.</i>

250
00:11:21,747 --> 00:11:23,465
      I used to be a good
     pickpocket back then.

251
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:25,684
I bought that new jacket,
      this bomber jacket,

252
00:11:25,718 --> 00:11:28,269
     and I took this photo
at Woolworth's in a photo booth.

253
00:11:28,304 --> 00:11:30,271
You remember Woolworth's?
        Pitkin Avenue?

254
00:11:30,306 --> 00:11:32,256
         Woolworth's?
  After taking this picture,

255
00:11:32,274 --> 00:11:34,425
      I caught the 14 bus
      off Pitkin Avenue.

256
00:11:34,443 --> 00:11:36,144
        I went to Utica
      Roller Skating Rink

257
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:37,479
     to meet up with some
    friends of mine.

258
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:38,763
        Since we didn't
         have nothing,

259
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:40,565
         we took pride
    in looking good.

260
00:11:40,599 --> 00:11:43,868
      Our clothes played
 a great role in our identity
     and our self-esteem.

261
00:11:43,903 --> 00:11:45,570
  You weren't shit unless you
had some shell-toe Adidas

262
00:11:45,604 --> 00:11:47,489
      or straight-legged
        jeans from Lee,

263
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:50,942
  a Kangol hat and those big
 stupid Star Wars ski goggles

264
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,443
          even though
    we couldn't ski.

265
00:11:52,461 --> 00:11:55,330
  Day of robbing spree would
 also include keeping our eyes

266
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:58,083
on the other little kids
 in the neighborhood that were
  robbing and stealing, too.

267
00:11:58,117 --> 00:11:59,968
        They were
      always easy scores

268
00:12:00,002 --> 00:12:02,170
     and they could never
     go back to the cops.

269
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:04,622
The worst thing that can happen
 there is you'd have to fight

270
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,890
    their big brother
or one of their friends.

271
00:12:05,925 --> 00:12:07,642
     But it's still easier
    than getting locked up.

272
00:12:07,676 --> 00:12:09,594
    Man, we were like
    a pack of wild wolves.

273
00:12:09,628 --> 00:12:11,295
    God forbid if you came
      to our neighborhood

274
00:12:11,313 --> 00:12:13,181
    and we didn't know you.
We might have killed you.

275
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:15,683
      And we could always
     be found on a corner

276
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:17,485
     unless we was hiding
        from the cops.

277
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:20,188
  We'd be there talking shit,
         smoking weed,

278
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:21,740
      gambling, drinking.

279
00:12:21,774 --> 00:12:24,859
  Night Train, Brass Monkey,
    Olde English 800.

280
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:27,695
You name it, we drank it.
    The cheaper the better.

281
00:12:28,614 --> 00:12:29,981
    That's real talk.

282
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:32,150
We'd sit around laughing
about our robbing spree,

283
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:34,819
 splitting money and laughing
 about almost getting caught.

284
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:37,488
      It was always funny
    until you were the one
    that got caught.

285
00:12:37,506 --> 00:12:40,091
    Shit, by the time
      I was 12 years old,

286
00:12:40,126 --> 00:12:42,160
        I was arrested
        over 38 times.

287
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:44,012
      You know how it is.

288
00:12:44,046 --> 00:12:45,547
 The juvenile detention center
      was like "Cheers."

289
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:47,098
    There, everybody
         knew my name.

290
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:49,267
          <i>No, really.</i>
         <i>No shit.</i>

291
00:12:49,301 --> 00:12:51,052
 <i>The whole of Brownsville</i>
     <i>was locked up with me.</i>

292
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:52,720
      It was like one big
        family reunion.

293
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:55,006
    No, like a summer camp.
  No, even better than that.

294
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:57,692
'Cause we got three hots
          and a cot.

295
00:12:57,726 --> 00:13:00,645
        For most of us,
that was royal treatment.

296
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:03,014
        But, you know,
when I wasn't locked up,

297
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:04,699
    which wasn't too often,

298
00:13:04,733 --> 00:13:07,351
only thing I enjoyed more
 than stealing was my pigeons.

299
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:09,154
     <i>My first fight started</i>
 <i>with one of my pigeons.</i>

300
00:13:09,188 --> 00:13:11,239
You know, Gary the bully
    stole one of my pigeons

301
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:13,541
         that <i>I</i> stole,
        you know.

302
00:13:13,576 --> 00:13:16,194
        And I'm like 10
         at the time.

303
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:18,997
    "Give me my bird back.
    Please, please, give me
        my bird back."

304
00:13:19,031 --> 00:13:21,532
"Shut the fuck up, nigga.
      You dumb fat fuck.

305
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:23,501
         You want this
      motherfucking bird?
          Fuck you."

306
00:13:23,535 --> 00:13:26,254
And he snapped my bird--
    the fucker, he snapped
        my bird's neck

307
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:28,173
and threw the blood on me
and hit me with the bird.

308
00:13:28,207 --> 00:13:31,209
    Then my rage let loose
  and I beat Gary the bully's
      motherfucking ass.

309
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:34,429
         - ( laughs )
         - ( cheering )

310
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:39,434
          It was love
        at first fight.

311
00:13:40,769 --> 00:13:42,153
   <i>It wouldn't be long before</i>
       <i>I got a reputation</i>

312
00:13:42,188 --> 00:13:44,222
        for being
    the good street fighter
     in the neighborhood.

313
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,908
 Older kids would bring other
 kids from other neighborhoods

314
00:13:46,942 --> 00:13:48,726
    who were supposed to be
     good street fighters

315
00:13:48,744 --> 00:13:50,528
      to come to my block
         to fight me.

316
00:13:50,562 --> 00:13:53,164
     Well, actually, they
    had to come to my block
     'cause I was only 10.

317
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:54,732
      My mother wouldn't
    let me leave the block.

318
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:58,236
Anyway, we would go into
alleyways or abandoned buildings

319
00:13:58,254 --> 00:14:01,456
 and the older guys would bet
    money on us, of course.

320
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:03,374
And they couldn't believe
 I was a fat kid with glasses

321
00:14:03,408 --> 00:14:04,959
    and I was kicking these
         kids' asses,

322
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:07,545
  punching 'em, slamming 'em,
  biting 'em, too, back then.

323
00:14:07,579 --> 00:14:09,214
          <i>( cheering )</i>

324
00:14:09,248 --> 00:14:10,932
      Oh, yeah, you know
         you got to--

325
00:14:10,966 --> 00:14:13,935
you know you got to bite
the motherfuckers to get
      them off your ass.

326
00:14:13,969 --> 00:14:16,087
    They might have you in
    the headlock too tight,

327
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:18,306
      right, and you got
      that leg-- arr-rr!

328
00:14:20,592 --> 00:14:23,278
         I was already
    a legend in the making,
     at least in my mind.

329
00:14:23,312 --> 00:14:25,813
I used my newfound talent
          as an asset

330
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:28,266
  to my new crime enterprise,
    of course, right?

331
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:30,151
     But I guess it wasn't
        a good venture

332
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:32,270
     because I got caught
    and finally sent away.

333
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:34,405
  Although I had a reputation
for being a good street fighter,

334
00:14:34,439 --> 00:14:36,941
     I still never thought
      about being a boxer
    or prizefighter.

335
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:39,327
I just wanted to be remembered
  for being something great.

336
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:42,747
      I didn't know what.
Like a gangster or stickup man
         or something.

337
00:14:42,781 --> 00:14:44,332
         Muhammad Ali:
         <i>I'm a bad man.</i>

338
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:46,467
         <i>I am the king</i>
         <i>of the world.</i>

339
00:14:46,502 --> 00:14:49,787
          <i>( cheering )</i>

340
00:14:49,805 --> 00:14:52,006
    I remember like it was
  yesterday when Muhammad Ali

341
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:54,142
came to Spofford Juvenile
    Detention Center

342
00:14:54,176 --> 00:14:56,794
to visit the kids there.
Man, he lit the place up.

343
00:14:56,812 --> 00:14:58,763
  And I was saying to myself,
            "Wow."

344
00:14:58,797 --> 00:15:01,399
    I didn't know how
 I was gonna do it, but I knew
    I wanted what Ali had.

345
00:15:01,433 --> 00:15:04,235
     I wanted people to be
  around me and look up to me
    because I was special.

346
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:07,155
     And at the time there
 was this trainer that worked
 at the Tryon School for Boys,

347
00:15:07,189 --> 00:15:10,608
     a place that I would
 eventually get transferred to
         from Spofford

348
00:15:10,642 --> 00:15:13,161
    'cause I stabbed
    a motherfucker, right?

349
00:15:13,195 --> 00:15:15,330
I was a beautiful child.

350
00:15:15,364 --> 00:15:17,648
          ( laughs )
I was a beautiful child.

351
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:19,334
        Listen, right.

352
00:15:19,368 --> 00:15:22,486
    So this trainer,
  he taught boys how to box.

353
00:15:22,504 --> 00:15:25,489
And I remember seeing the guys
    when I was in the hold.

354
00:15:25,507 --> 00:15:27,292
     They were coming back
from the other side of the dorm

355
00:15:27,326 --> 00:15:29,510
      with cracked ribs,
bloody noses, knocked-out teeth.

356
00:15:29,545 --> 00:15:33,298
     But they were happy.
And I wanted to be happy, too.

357
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:35,049
      So I said, "Yo, yo,
    what's going on?"

358
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,500
  'Cause that's how I talked
          back then.

359
00:15:36,518 --> 00:15:38,436
"Yo, yo, what's going on
 back there, man? What's up?"

360
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:40,221
    I wanted to be in
     that program so bad,

361
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:42,106
      but he ignored me.

362
00:15:42,141 --> 00:15:44,609
  The trainer, Bobby Stewart,
    who we're watching now,

363
00:15:44,643 --> 00:15:46,811
he ignored me because he
 thought I was a troublemaker,

364
00:15:46,845 --> 00:15:48,679
  and I was 'cause I stabbed
      a guy to get there.

365
00:15:48,697 --> 00:15:51,515
     It was a bad place...

366
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:54,068
    So he comes to my room
  in the middle of the night

367
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:55,686
     'cause I told people
     I wanted to meet him

368
00:15:55,704 --> 00:15:57,989
          and this is
        his white ass.

369
00:15:58,023 --> 00:16:00,208
          <i>( laughter )</i>

370
00:16:00,242 --> 00:16:02,460
  "Let me tell you something,
     you little dickhead.

371
00:16:02,494 --> 00:16:04,862
     I hear you want to be
        in my program."

372
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,331
          <i>( laughter )</i>

373
00:16:06,365 --> 00:16:08,132
      "You got to show me
     you're ready to work

374
00:16:08,167 --> 00:16:10,551
without being an asshole,
        asshole.

375
00:16:12,087 --> 00:16:13,204
        And then you do
         that with me,

376
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:15,256
      maybe I could work
     with your dumb ass."

377
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:17,675
        And this is how
    he talked to me.
Just met me that evening.

378
00:16:17,709 --> 00:16:19,227
         It was hard,
         but I did it.

379
00:16:19,261 --> 00:16:21,062
     I got on honor roll.
You know the honor roll.

380
00:16:21,096 --> 00:16:23,648
  The slow kids' honor roll.
    Special ed honor roll.

381
00:16:23,682 --> 00:16:26,100
      I made the fucking
    special ed honor roll.

382
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:28,403
  Like, "what block will fit
  into this hole" type shit.

383
00:16:28,437 --> 00:16:29,821
      I did it. I did it.

384
00:16:29,855 --> 00:16:32,723
       <i>Who needs boxing?</i>
      <i>I got on honor roll.</i>

385
00:16:32,741 --> 00:16:34,776
      So he introduced me
    to this old Italian man

386
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:36,411
    that would change
     the path of my life.

387
00:16:36,445 --> 00:16:39,530
     This guy would become
    my mentor and his name
    was Cus D'Amato.

388
00:16:39,564 --> 00:16:42,900
          <i>( applause )</i>

389
00:16:46,238 --> 00:16:48,072
     The names Mike Tyson
        and Cus D'Amato

390
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:50,425
  would forever be synonymous
    with one another.

391
00:16:50,459 --> 00:16:53,244
   <i>You can't mention my name</i>
     <i>and not ever reference</i>
       <i>the legacy of Cus</i>

392
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:56,580
    nor can you mention Cus
without reference to my legacy.

393
00:16:56,598 --> 00:17:00,134
  Cus told me from the moment
  he met me what would happen
    after he watched me box

394
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:02,470
      and follow his map
          to success.

395
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:04,255
        He said--
just like this, he said,

396
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:05,890
  "Now, Mike, I'll tell you,
  Mike, if you listen to me,

397
00:17:05,924 --> 00:17:09,760
  you really want to do this,
I'm gonna put you in the locals,

398
00:17:09,778 --> 00:17:12,030
      then the regionals,
      then the nationals.

399
00:17:12,064 --> 00:17:13,698
    You're gonna win that,
     and then after that,

400
00:17:13,732 --> 00:17:16,567
      you're gonna become
the youngest heavyweight
      champ of all time.

401
00:17:16,601 --> 00:17:19,737
          As of now,
    I hold the record
  with Floyd Patterson at 21.

402
00:17:19,771 --> 00:17:23,157
  You could break that record
 at 20 and be the youngest and
the greatest of all time.

403
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:25,410
      Only if you listen
      to me, of course."

404
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:30,548
      And so, of course,
     I'm a young black kid
     from the inner city.

405
00:17:30,582 --> 00:17:33,584
     Cus says this to me,
this white man said this
to me with no hesitation.

406
00:17:33,618 --> 00:17:35,970
    I thought he was
      a pervert at first.

407
00:17:36,004 --> 00:17:38,956
 No, 'cause where I come from,
 they was trying to fuck you.

408
00:17:38,974 --> 00:17:40,758
    There's always somebody
  trying to fuck you, right?

409
00:17:40,792 --> 00:17:42,844
But really, believe it or not,
  his confidence in delivery

410
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:45,346
made me believe this was
 gonna be an easy task, right?

411
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:48,149
  At the time, I had no idea
what I was getting myself into.

412
00:17:48,183 --> 00:17:50,234
          I just knew
    it sounded good.

413
00:17:50,269 --> 00:17:52,653
    When I got discouraged,
        as I often did,

414
00:17:52,688 --> 00:17:55,490
he would massage my mind
with these great thoughts

415
00:17:55,524 --> 00:17:59,026
    of exotic worlds
and masterful treasures.

416
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:01,362
    Man, everything he said
sounded so foreign to me,

417
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:03,147
      but I loved the way
        it sound.

418
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:06,200
        There we were,
     venturing off on this
     magnificent adventure

419
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:08,086
    like two pirates
ready to claim our riches

420
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:10,621
    and to decimate anyone
    that stands in our way.

421
00:18:10,655 --> 00:18:15,126
  This old man made me hunger
for glory like a mad dog.

422
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,712
  So one of the first things
    Cus ever told me

423
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:20,515
      was this invention
      called the Willie.
      The Willie, right?

424
00:18:20,549 --> 00:18:23,334
    It's named after light
     heavyweight champion
    Willie Pastrano.

425
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:25,353
     Let me explain this.

426
00:18:25,387 --> 00:18:27,555
      Cus would call out
        a number.

427
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:28,689
      Cus would call out
        these numbers.

428
00:18:28,724 --> 00:18:30,341
        Cus would call
    these numbers out

429
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:33,811
         and I'm gonna
          do it slow

430
00:18:33,845 --> 00:18:35,696
    'cause I'm an old
 motherfucker now, all right?

431
00:18:35,731 --> 00:18:38,349
         But Cus would
    call out numbers
     in rapid succession.

432
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:39,534
          It would go
     something like this.

433
00:18:39,568 --> 00:18:41,018
        One-- left hook
    to the jaw. Boom.

434
00:18:41,036 --> 00:18:42,686
    Two-- right hook
    to the jaw. Boom.

435
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:45,022
    Three-- left uppercut.
    Four-- right uppercut.

436
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,491
    Five-- left hook
         to the liver.

437
00:18:46,525 --> 00:18:48,192
    Six-- right hand
        to the spleen.

438
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:50,861
Seven-- jab to the head.
Eight-- jab to the body.

439
00:18:50,879 --> 00:18:53,297
  Fuck. I'm glad I don't have
to do that for a living no more.

440
00:18:53,332 --> 00:18:55,082
        God damn.

441
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:58,702
     But anyway, our early
 adventures started traveling
     all over the country

442
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,755
 fighting in these small clubs
    called "smokers."

443
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:02,223
      And the reason why
they were called smokers

444
00:19:02,257 --> 00:19:04,142
is because the cigarette
        and cigar smoke

445
00:19:04,176 --> 00:19:06,594
         was so thick,
     you could hardly see
    the guy you're fighting

446
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:08,062
    let alone the guy
      you're talking to.

447
00:19:08,096 --> 00:19:09,814
     And Cus was a big man
        in this world.

448
00:19:09,848 --> 00:19:11,899
      And the fights was
pretty much unsanctioned,

449
00:19:11,934 --> 00:19:13,434
     which meant lawless.

450
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:14,902
        There was never
    no paramedics outside.

451
00:19:14,937 --> 00:19:17,572
    If you got a concussion
  and you died, it's on <i>you.</i>

452
00:19:17,606 --> 00:19:19,890
        You know?
    No, this is real talk.

453
00:19:19,908 --> 00:19:22,660
    And plus, if the crowd
 didn't like your performance,
    they didn't boo.

454
00:19:22,694 --> 00:19:24,745
    They fought each other
      to show you how it
    was really done.

455
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:27,198
     This is some serious
    Puerto Rican shit, man.
    I'm serious, all right?

456
00:19:27,232 --> 00:19:29,283
         I'm serious.
  You think I'm bullshitting?

457
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:31,419
  No offense, Puerto Ricans,
         but listen...

458
00:19:31,453 --> 00:19:33,421
     <i>( laughter, applause )</i>

459
00:19:33,455 --> 00:19:35,573
      y'all some fighting
        motherfuckers.

460
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:37,074
    You're either fighting,
     fucking, or cutting.

461
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:39,577
  Y'all are doing some shit.
          But anyway,

462
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:42,079
          so I'm like
     14 years old, right?

463
00:19:42,097 --> 00:19:45,349
    But Cus had me chiseled
  in this great Michelangelo
      statue right here.

464
00:19:45,384 --> 00:19:47,251
        Back-- not now.
     Back then, all right?

465
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:50,438
      I was really cut up
  like I got in a fight with
the Latin Kings and lost.

466
00:19:50,472 --> 00:19:52,390
      No, listen, really.
I won the national championship

467
00:19:52,424 --> 00:19:54,275
  just like Cus said I would
            at 14.

468
00:19:54,309 --> 00:19:56,444
      I broke the record
for the fastest knockout.

469
00:19:56,478 --> 00:19:59,030
      Never been broken.
        Eight seconds.

470
00:19:59,064 --> 00:20:02,233
         ( applause )

471
00:20:02,267 --> 00:20:04,819
     I was well on my way.

472
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:09,123
          So one day
        Cus looks at me
        dead in my eye

473
00:20:09,157 --> 00:20:12,210
         and he goes,
"Hey, Michael, you scared
    of white people?"

474
00:20:12,244 --> 00:20:15,379
             What?
     "You, are you scared
    of white people?"

475
00:20:15,414 --> 00:20:17,715
             Fuck.

476
00:20:17,749 --> 00:20:20,718
      I'm scared of this
white motherfucker right here.

477
00:20:20,752 --> 00:20:23,137
    Shit, I'm not worried.
He didn't get reelected.

478
00:20:23,171 --> 00:20:24,955
        I'm cool.

479
00:20:24,973 --> 00:20:26,790
        Elected.
        I got fucked up
        with the words.

480
00:20:26,808 --> 00:20:28,342
        Elected.

481
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:30,094
     Shit, I can't believe
      Spike's racist ass

482
00:20:30,128 --> 00:20:32,146
 didn't have George Zimmerman
    up here instead of him.

483
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:33,981
             Shit.

484
00:20:34,016 --> 00:20:37,018
        Oh, shit.

485
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:38,969
             Fuck.

486
00:20:38,987 --> 00:20:40,804
    Love to Trayvon Martin
          and family.

487
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:43,190
         But, anyway,
    I'm talking shit.

488
00:20:45,977 --> 00:20:49,280
          <i>( laughter )</i>

489
00:20:50,532 --> 00:20:53,334
        But really, no,
  as I'm saying this to you,

490
00:20:53,368 --> 00:20:56,837
    and I'm speaking
 very eloquent at the moment,

491
00:20:56,872 --> 00:20:58,989
Spike isn't worth a damn

492
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:00,824
     because Spike knew me
        over 20 years,

493
00:21:00,842 --> 00:21:04,128
     but he never told me
     that, "Mike, you need
    a fucking interpreter.

494
00:21:04,162 --> 00:21:06,097
  I don't know what the fuck
    you're talking about."

495
00:21:06,131 --> 00:21:08,382
     <i>( laughter, applause )</i>

496
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:10,668
This was not even on the show.
    This is some real shit.

497
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:14,272
         So anyway...
  Cus was born in like 1905.

498
00:21:14,306 --> 00:21:15,839
      So he sees a big--
    what's that word?

499
00:21:15,857 --> 00:21:18,476
          Transition.
  He sees the big transition
    in the black community.

500
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:22,029
    So he goes like,
    "You ain't afraid
         of white men.

501
00:21:22,064 --> 00:21:24,014
    You're not afraid
of mustaches and beards.

502
00:21:24,032 --> 00:21:26,784
    I've been around a lot
  of black fighters that are
  afraid to hit white people.

503
00:21:26,818 --> 00:21:28,486
    You better not be
      one of those kind.

504
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,020
Wasting my goddamn time.
        I'm an old man.

505
00:21:30,038 --> 00:21:31,355
    I don't got time
          to waste."

506
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:33,074
     I'm like, "Whoa, Cus.
        It's the '80s.

507
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:34,525
     I'm okay with hitting
        a white person.

508
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:36,160
         Just tell me.
As a matter of fact, Cus,
        I'm cool.

509
00:21:36,194 --> 00:21:38,028
         Just tell me.
    I'll hit anybody
     you tell me to, Cus."

510
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:41,248
      Because I love Cus.

511
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:44,535
     You know, even though
  he's an old man and small,

512
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:45,920
            he was
      very intimidating.

513
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:47,705
          Here I am,
    a boy of 14 years old,

514
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:51,058
    and I have this old man
  in my face intimidating me.

515
00:21:51,093 --> 00:21:53,427
        Just like this.
    "Mike, you got to punch
    with both hands.

516
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:55,646
        And don't
      let him hold you."

517
00:21:55,681 --> 00:21:58,599
     <i>He's a mean-ass</i>
     <i>old Italian man.</i>

518
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:00,017
    It's just intimidating
        with his words

519
00:22:00,051 --> 00:22:01,519
        telling me <i>not</i>
      to be intimidated.

520
00:22:01,553 --> 00:22:02,903
    But yet I'm intimidated

521
00:22:02,938 --> 00:22:04,522
with the way he's trying
    to tell me not to be--

522
00:22:04,556 --> 00:22:05,690
    you kind of getting me?

523
00:22:05,724 --> 00:22:06,991
    I was intimidated
    across the board.

524
00:22:07,025 --> 00:22:08,275
          I was just
        fucked up, man.

525
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:10,578
    But Cus was beautiful.
          I love Cus

526
00:22:10,612 --> 00:22:12,663
because I'm a street kid.

527
00:22:12,698 --> 00:22:14,732
     I never had a mother
or a father really that close.

528
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,450
    But he taught me
      how to read, write.

529
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:17,952
      He was very patient
        with me.

530
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:20,204
He encouraged me to read
     anything I could get
         my hands on.

531
00:22:20,238 --> 00:22:22,373
          So one day
I'm in Cus's living room

532
00:22:22,407 --> 00:22:24,408
        and I'm reading
the boxing encyclopedia.

533
00:22:24,426 --> 00:22:26,460
        "Encyclopedia."
That's a word I learned.

534
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:27,911
     I had to work on that
     with a speech coach.

535
00:22:27,929 --> 00:22:30,080
         Encyclopedia.

536
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:34,101
  A record of great fighters
      like Sam Langford,

537
00:22:34,136 --> 00:22:37,087
Harry Greb, Jack Britton,
    Ted "Kid" Lewis,

538
00:22:37,105 --> 00:22:40,391
          Willie Pep
    and the great legendary
      Sugar Ray Robinson.

539
00:22:40,425 --> 00:22:43,144
       <i>And these are six</i>
   <i>funny-looking guys, right?</i>

540
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:45,946
         But when you
add up all their fights,
that's like 1,500 fights.

541
00:22:45,981 --> 00:22:48,482
    I gave up right there.
     I said, "Cus, I can't
        do this shit."

542
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:50,785
      I didn't say shit.
But I said, "Cus, I could
      never be like them.

543
00:22:50,819 --> 00:22:52,787
    I can't do this."

544
00:22:52,821 --> 00:22:54,772
     Then he looked at me
in the eye with angry passion.

545
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:56,940
    "Mike, you got to read
the whole records, Mike.

546
00:22:56,958 --> 00:22:59,043
         Look at 'em.
     What you doing trying

547
00:22:59,077 --> 00:23:00,878
 to accomplish what these guys
      tried to accomplish

548
00:23:00,912 --> 00:23:04,081
     if you're not willing
 to endure the misery and pain
      these guys endured?

549
00:23:04,115 --> 00:23:06,967
 We never hear any more about
  the guys that knocked them
  out early in their career.

550
00:23:07,002 --> 00:23:09,837
Know why, Mike? Know why?
 'Cause at one point somebody
    knocked <i>them</i> out, Mike.

551
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:12,139
        But they quit.
     But these men you're
        reading about,

552
00:23:12,174 --> 00:23:13,641
    these champions,
    they never quit.

553
00:23:13,675 --> 00:23:15,125
          They never
    got discouraged.

554
00:23:15,143 --> 00:23:17,461
        You know?
        And that's why
        the other guys,

555
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:19,230
  their demons are following
      them forever, Mike.

556
00:23:19,264 --> 00:23:21,732
'Cause they had a chance
     to face their demons
    and they didn't.

557
00:23:21,767 --> 00:23:23,934
    No, they didn't.
 You have to face your demons.

558
00:23:23,968 --> 00:23:25,853
      You hear me, Mike?
     'Cause if you don't,

559
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:28,639
     they will follow you
         to eternity.

560
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:31,659
    And you remember, Mike,
be careful how you fight
          your fights

561
00:23:31,693 --> 00:23:34,478
'cause the way you fight
  your fights be the way you
    live your life."

562
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:37,531
    And I never quit again.

563
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:41,085
        A little later
     in my amateur career
  when I had this big head--

564
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:43,153
      ( audience laughs )

565
00:23:43,171 --> 00:23:45,172
        What the fuck?

566
00:23:45,207 --> 00:23:47,258
  This looks like the 1910--
        don't I look--

567
00:23:47,292 --> 00:23:48,709
          no, really,
        I was psyched.

568
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,828
         Don't I look
    like these guys?

569
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:53,881
    Look at this guy.
     It was all about the
    bulge back then.

570
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:56,016
           <i>It was all</i>
     <i>about the bulge.</i>

571
00:23:56,051 --> 00:23:57,768
      In my early career,
     I had this big head.

572
00:23:57,803 --> 00:23:59,353
     I was national champ.

573
00:23:59,387 --> 00:24:02,673
  And my talents were pretty
awesome back then, right?

574
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:04,892
    I was a 14-year-old kid
    knocking out grown men.

575
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:07,344
    Cus was so happy.
      Guys in the middle
         of the night,

576
00:24:07,362 --> 00:24:09,613
     my sparring partners,
  in the middle of the night,
    they would leave.

577
00:24:09,648 --> 00:24:11,782
        Pack their bags
  in the middle of the night

578
00:24:11,817 --> 00:24:13,818
    when there's no lights
        and just walk--

579
00:24:13,852 --> 00:24:16,954
        and leave
     without getting paid.

580
00:24:16,988 --> 00:24:20,458
        But, you know,
      after getting a bad
beating by me, of course.

581
00:24:20,492 --> 00:24:22,493
     But who doesn't want
         to get paid?

582
00:24:22,527 --> 00:24:25,996
    It was the house joke.
  Cus would say, "Another one
        bites the dust.

583
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:27,414
Another bites the dust."

584
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:29,083
So Cus would be around me
          telling me,

585
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:31,302
     "If you listen to me,
 you'll be a god beyond means.

586
00:24:31,336 --> 00:24:33,971
    People will carry
      your mother's bag."

587
00:24:34,005 --> 00:24:35,890
    Cus thought I would be
         a god of war.

588
00:24:35,924 --> 00:24:37,892
 This is what this old Italian
    man kept saying to me.

589
00:24:37,926 --> 00:24:40,427
    He fucked me up.
     You know what I mean?

590
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:42,045
    That's why I got
     in all this trouble.

591
00:24:42,063 --> 00:24:43,481
        I thought I was
        a fucking god.

592
00:24:43,515 --> 00:24:47,268
     'Cause I was kicking
 niggas' ass like I was a god.

593
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:49,820
Cus said I was the baddest man
    on the planet one day.

594
00:24:49,855 --> 00:24:52,723
    I was just a kid
     and I thought I was.

595
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:55,392
    I'm a local celebrity.
    Catskills stuff.

596
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:57,278
I'm always in the papers.

597
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:59,914
 The professional boxing world
     had their eye on me.

598
00:24:59,948 --> 00:25:02,833
  And so every now and then,
  I'd go back to Brownsville

599
00:25:02,868 --> 00:25:04,919
    to hang out with my old
 friends I used to hustle with

600
00:25:04,953 --> 00:25:07,421
    and talk about my crazy
     life with these white
        people, right?

601
00:25:07,455 --> 00:25:10,207
        I go down there
    carrying a photo album.

602
00:25:10,241 --> 00:25:12,877
 Nigga, I blew my friends away
      with pictures of me

603
00:25:12,911 --> 00:25:14,762
  and my little happy white--
    no, not white friends.

604
00:25:14,796 --> 00:25:17,264
             I got
      <i>happy</i> white friends.

605
00:25:17,299 --> 00:25:19,917
        I got well-fed,
          nourished,

606
00:25:19,935 --> 00:25:22,436
     a happy white school,
    hugging, kissing.

607
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:24,104
I'm holding white babies.

608
00:25:24,139 --> 00:25:25,923
      I looked like I was
  running for mayor up there.

609
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:28,392
        You know?
      I looked like a fly
        in buttermilk.

610
00:25:28,426 --> 00:25:30,394
     Look at my black ass
        up there.

611
00:25:30,428 --> 00:25:32,646
      I just don't belong
    in that picture.

612
00:25:33,932 --> 00:25:35,232
      Look like I'm about
          to rob them

613
00:25:35,266 --> 00:25:36,951
after their last supper.

614
00:25:36,985 --> 00:25:38,702
    I just don't fit there,

615
00:25:38,737 --> 00:25:40,821
    but these motherfuckers
    loved me, right?

616
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:42,323
You know, they loved me.

617
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:44,708
 <i>I was one of those guys</i>
      <i>that lived upstate.</i>

618
00:25:44,743 --> 00:25:46,827
     I came from upstate,
lived with a good white family.

619
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:49,079
         Liberal kind
         that take in

620
00:25:49,113 --> 00:25:51,465
         badass blacks
  and Puerto Ricans and shit.

621
00:25:51,499 --> 00:25:54,301
Like the Fresh Air Fund.
     "Come up and get some
          fresh air.

622
00:25:54,336 --> 00:25:56,136
         They're okay,
  they just need fresh air."

623
00:25:56,171 --> 00:25:58,088
      You know that shit,
     people that have been
        in group homes.

624
00:25:58,122 --> 00:26:00,841
  You know about that, right?
"They just need some fresh air.
      They're good kids."

625
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:02,843
 Then I'd go back to Brooklyn
 and I'm still robbing people.

626
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:05,813
     Give me the-- give me
      the fucking chain,
         you stupid--

627
00:26:05,847 --> 00:26:07,348
Then I'd go back upstate
     with my white family.

628
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:09,516
          "Hi, guys."

629
00:26:12,604 --> 00:26:14,488
            I'd go,
      "What's for dinner?

630
00:26:14,522 --> 00:26:17,157
          Lamb chops?
      Oh, God! Oh, shit.

631
00:26:17,192 --> 00:26:20,194
Oh, God. Camille, I love
your lamb chops so much."

632
00:26:21,863 --> 00:26:23,614
        I say Camille,
    I'm talking about
        Camille Ewald.

633
00:26:23,648 --> 00:26:26,817
  That's Cus's life partner.

634
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:29,703
    She's a Ukrainian lady.
          Right here.

635
00:26:29,754 --> 00:26:31,255
        Not the first,
      that's the sister.
        But right here.

636
00:26:31,289 --> 00:26:33,874
 And she was a beautiful woman
'cause she had great food

637
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:35,709
    that I never ate before
     and I loved the food

638
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,795
    and she loved me
    because I loved to eat
         all her food.

639
00:26:37,829 --> 00:26:39,880
    And-- I'm sorry,
          I'm sorry.

640
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:41,515
  Back to the robbing spree.

641
00:26:41,549 --> 00:26:44,768
Okay, as we were passing
 the joint around, of course,

642
00:26:44,803 --> 00:26:47,388
            looking
      in the photo album,

643
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:50,941
    Panamanian Ernie said,
"Hey, papi, what the fuck, papi?

644
00:26:50,976 --> 00:26:52,676
    You fucking with
     these crackers, boy.

645
00:26:52,694 --> 00:26:55,562
    Papi, you kissing
      these babies, bro.

646
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:57,615
You fucking-- don't fall
    for the okey doke, boy.

647
00:26:57,649 --> 00:26:59,182
     I'm telling you, bro.
    Don't go for it, dawg."

648
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,952
     So my man Black goes,
     Black goes like this,
          Black said,

649
00:27:01,987 --> 00:27:04,071
 "Let's get this money, nigga.
    You up there with them
        motherfuckers,

650
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:06,189
 big-ass white motherfuckers,
      let's see what they
         brought you."

651
00:27:06,207 --> 00:27:09,710
        And I'm saying,
    "Let's do this," right?
 But it's different this time.

652
00:27:09,744 --> 00:27:11,629
     It's a lot different
          this time.

653
00:27:11,663 --> 00:27:15,532
My friend, Barkim, he's older.
  He's around 18 at the time.

654
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:19,036
         And he goes--
    he's a Five Percenter.

655
00:27:21,423 --> 00:27:23,206
    So I'm sure I see
    Five Percenters,

656
00:27:23,224 --> 00:27:25,092
    people that were
     Five Percenters here.

657
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:27,594
 It's supposed to be a real--
a real righteous brother.

658
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:30,097
        Very righteous.
          Supposedly.

659
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:32,933
           <i>Supposed--</i>

660
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:35,719
        You never heard
      of a Five Percenter
    in your life, have you?

661
00:27:35,737 --> 00:27:40,741
        Have you?
    This righteous brother,
     he's smoking with us.

662
00:27:40,775 --> 00:27:45,729
"Yo, yo, Mike, man, what
  the fuck you doing, nigga?

663
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:50,734
      These white people
        love you, man.

664
00:27:50,752 --> 00:27:53,120
      They love you, man.
         This ain't--

665
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:55,873
    Go back up there
 with them white people, man.

666
00:27:55,907 --> 00:27:57,574
Don't be fucking with us, man.
        Fuck that shit.

667
00:27:57,592 --> 00:27:59,760
    I wish I had some
 white people that loved me."

668
00:28:01,796 --> 00:28:03,797
        And Barkim died
      shortly after that.

669
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:06,016
Somebody murdered him, you know,
  'cause he was in the game.

670
00:28:06,051 --> 00:28:07,801
        I always wonder
  if I didn't listen to him,

671
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:10,187
I wonder would I be here
      telling this story.

672
00:28:10,221 --> 00:28:12,255
    But not everybody
  was happy with my success.

673
00:28:12,273 --> 00:28:14,441
          No, no, no.
            Uh-uh.

674
00:28:14,476 --> 00:28:17,144
    There were some haters.
  You need haters to motivate
         you, though.

675
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:18,812
    Got to have 'em.

676
00:28:18,863 --> 00:28:21,699
  They resented my fast rise
    and close ties to Cus.

677
00:28:21,733 --> 00:28:25,369
In particular, a trainer
      named Teddy Atlas.

678
00:28:25,403 --> 00:28:28,989
     Yeah. He didn't like
    Cus telling him to drop
        other fighters

679
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,273
    and focus on me.

680
00:28:30,291 --> 00:28:33,160
He thought I was arrogant
and spoiled, which I was.

681
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:34,995
    But what he said
         don't matter

682
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:39,416
        'cause Cus had
my back and my talent was
     un-fucking-deniable.

683
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:42,452
         ( cheering )

684
00:28:43,838 --> 00:28:47,958
So Teddy had this sister-in-law
    who was 12 at the time.

685
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:50,177
         And I was 15.

686
00:28:50,228 --> 00:28:51,979
          I knew her
     for a couple of years

687
00:28:52,013 --> 00:28:55,015
        'cause we went
     to the same Catskill
upstate New York school.

688
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:58,135
    And we knew each other
  every day 'cause Teddy was
    married to her sister.

689
00:28:58,153 --> 00:29:01,772
     You know, everybody's
  close like a little family,
    everyday stuff, right?

690
00:29:01,806 --> 00:29:05,308
  And I was an awkward dude.
    Never been with a girl.

691
00:29:05,326 --> 00:29:07,144
    Put that one in.
     Never kissed a girl.

692
00:29:07,162 --> 00:29:08,645
      Well, I kissed her,
  but never with the tongue.

693
00:29:08,663 --> 00:29:12,199
    I kissed pigeons.
     I like pigeons, so I
        kissed pigeons.

694
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:15,202
But we joked around a lot
 and I felt really comfortable
         around there.

695
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:16,537
      Around the ladies,
          of course.

696
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:18,038
    I'm talking about
    the young girls.

697
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:20,824
    So one day in a moment
        of immaturity,

698
00:29:20,842 --> 00:29:23,377
     with raging hormones
    taking the lead,

699
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:25,345
      I grabbed her ass.

700
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:28,832
    I don't know what hand.
I know I grabbed her ass,
        though, right?

701
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:32,836
  You're an older gentleman,
so I'm sure you may know, sir.

702
00:29:32,854 --> 00:29:36,523
    And you look like
 you've made a lot of mistakes
         in your life.

703
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:41,278
          You ever do
 something when the fantasy--
    the fantasy in the head

704
00:29:41,312 --> 00:29:44,398
is going on in your head
    and your head tells you
    if you make this move,

705
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:47,568
          the fantasy
    will become a reality?

706
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:50,737
People are familiar with that?
All right, so I made the move.

707
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:53,657
I didn't get the response
      that I anticipated,

708
00:29:53,691 --> 00:29:55,742
    and the response
 I got back was like, "Fuck."

709
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:58,045
      And it wasn't like
  she said, "Fuck you, Mike!
     Why did you do that?"

710
00:29:58,079 --> 00:30:01,915
     It was like, "Fuck."
And you just like, "Fuck!
Why did I do this? Fuck!"

711
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:05,002
 And she didn't say anything,
 but you know it wasn't right
    when you touch it

712
00:30:05,036 --> 00:30:06,837
    and they, "Whoo,"
      and looked at you.

713
00:30:06,871 --> 00:30:09,139
         And you said,
          "Oh, shit."

714
00:30:09,174 --> 00:30:10,924
        And this nigga,
        I know he know.

715
00:30:10,975 --> 00:30:12,476
         Oh, you know
    that's some shit.

716
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:14,511
     The cops are coming,
     or somebody is going
      to come with a gun.

717
00:30:14,545 --> 00:30:16,930
    Bad idea, right?

718
00:30:16,981 --> 00:30:19,399
     So now it's 6:00 p.m.

719
00:30:19,434 --> 00:30:21,985
     I'm going to the gym
        as I always do

720
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:24,404
      and she told Teddy.

721
00:30:24,439 --> 00:30:26,406
        And I see Teddy

722
00:30:26,441 --> 00:30:30,027
      and he looks as mad
      as a motherfucker.

723
00:30:30,061 --> 00:30:33,730
     Teddy had a bad back
     from a car accident,

724
00:30:33,748 --> 00:30:36,066
    so he was always
  cracking his fucking back.

725
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:39,286
And it always reminded me
     of somebody suffering
    from Tourette's.

726
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:41,171
Because he'd be talking--
even training he's like,

727
00:30:41,206 --> 00:30:42,956
"Move your head." Crack.
"Move your head." Crack. Crack.

728
00:30:43,007 --> 00:30:45,459
    "Move your head."
And he's moving and shit,
    and like, crack.

729
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:48,128
    And I'm looking at him
          over there

730
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:49,630
         and he's mad.

731
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:52,633
  And I see him and he starts
      coming towards me.

732
00:30:53,801 --> 00:30:55,936
      "Mike, come here."
     Crack, crack, crack.

733
00:30:59,641 --> 00:31:01,558
      And he grabs me...

734
00:31:01,592 --> 00:31:03,110
         crack, crack.

735
00:31:03,144 --> 00:31:06,480
     But he pulls his big
    motherfucking gun out.

736
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:09,266
  Not that fucking funny now,
    Miss Red Dress, is it?

737
00:31:09,284 --> 00:31:11,451
           <i>All right?</i>
             <i>So...</i>

738
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:15,605
    This is my head.
          So he goes,

739
00:31:15,623 --> 00:31:18,408
 "Motherfucker, you ever touch
 anybody in my motherfucking--

740
00:31:18,442 --> 00:31:21,628
        I'll blow your
    motherfucking head off,
      you motherfucker."

741
00:31:21,663 --> 00:31:24,164
      - My head's here now
        and he goes...
      - <i>( gunshot )</i>

742
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:26,333
      He don't shoot me,
     but he shoots the gun
    close to my ear.

743
00:31:26,384 --> 00:31:29,920
      You, sir, you look
like you've been shot at
        before, right?

744
00:31:29,954 --> 00:31:31,922
          ( laughs )

745
00:31:31,956 --> 00:31:33,840
         You know that
    proverbial "bong"

746
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:36,560
      that goes off when
    the gun goes and, bong!

747
00:31:36,594 --> 00:31:39,479
     That happened to me.
After Teddy shot the gun,
he was the one that ran.

748
00:31:39,514 --> 00:31:41,481
      And I'm not saying
I was a bad motherfucker.

749
00:31:41,516 --> 00:31:42,849
    I wasn't, like, going,
    "Fuck you, nigga.

750
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:44,017
        Shoot me.
      I'm ready to die."

751
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:45,852
      I was like, "Whoa!
    Fuck! Stop! Wait!

752
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:48,488
    Hey, motherfucker, why?
            Shit!"

753
00:31:48,523 --> 00:31:50,490
        You know?
            "Cus!"

754
00:31:50,525 --> 00:31:52,609
        God damn.

755
00:31:52,643 --> 00:31:54,361
Who's from Staten Island?

756
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:56,446
     <i>( audience shouting )</i>

757
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:59,116
    Raise your hand.
          I see you.

758
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:02,035
    All right, so Teddy was
from Staten Island, okay?

759
00:32:02,086 --> 00:32:04,288
     So on Staten Island,
      you know everybody
    on Staten Island

760
00:32:04,322 --> 00:32:05,822
         think they're
a motherfucking gangster.

761
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,257
    Out there on Todt Hill.
    What's that hill?

762
00:32:07,292 --> 00:32:08,759
          Toot Hill?
          Todt Hill?

763
00:32:08,793 --> 00:32:11,762
             So...
     I wish I had my ring.

764
00:32:11,796 --> 00:32:13,931
  But this is the proverbial
    Staten Island gangster.

765
00:32:13,965 --> 00:32:16,166
      "You looking at me
        up there?

766
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:17,768
Hey, it's Staten Island."
     So he went like this.

767
00:32:17,802 --> 00:32:20,354
    This is a Staten
         Island thing.

768
00:32:24,692 --> 00:32:26,676
    "Hey, my friend.

769
00:32:26,694 --> 00:32:29,479
    If you knew who I knew,

770
00:32:29,513 --> 00:32:33,483
    you wouldn't be popping
at the fucking gums, you know?

771
00:32:35,019 --> 00:32:37,904
        Oh, yeah?
          You want--

772
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:39,456
      my fucking uncle--
        yeah, my uncle.

773
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:42,626
    My fucking uncle.
      My motherfucking--
     my mother's brother,

774
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:45,712
he fucking cleans Paulie
  Castellano's colostomy bag,

775
00:32:45,747 --> 00:32:48,081
      you fucking moolie
         motherfucker!

776
00:32:48,132 --> 00:32:51,201
You fucking moolie fuck!"

777
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:55,372
   <i>What the fuck's a moolie?</i>

778
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:58,175
There was a lot of rumors
that went on about this.

779
00:32:58,209 --> 00:32:59,926
    Everybody thought I was
     a 20-year-old pervert

780
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:02,545
and she was 12 years old,
      but I was only 15.

781
00:33:02,563 --> 00:33:06,933
      And I'd never been
      with a girl before.

782
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:09,186
     But Cus was outraged

783
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:12,356
      and he fired Teddy.
    Teddy went to New York

784
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:15,575
and trained some fighters
and we never spoke again.

785
00:33:18,529 --> 00:33:21,031
   <i>You know, it was very easy</i>
  <i>for me to block out the fact</i>

786
00:33:21,065 --> 00:33:24,584
    that my mother was sick
when I was being praised
    and worshipped upstate.

787
00:33:24,619 --> 00:33:27,120
    Actually, I didn't know
    how sick she was until
    it was too late.

788
00:33:28,706 --> 00:33:31,375
      She died of cancer,
     but I think she died
      of a broken heart,

789
00:33:31,409 --> 00:33:34,261
    a shattered dream
 that she never accomplished.

790
00:33:35,913 --> 00:33:38,581
See, my mother was always
talking about her death.

791
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:40,750
    For some crazy reason,
    she had a fear of dying

792
00:33:40,768 --> 00:33:42,352
      and her body going
    to this place called--

793
00:33:42,387 --> 00:33:44,104
    what's it called,
        potter's field?

794
00:33:44,138 --> 00:33:46,223
A year before her death,
she started saving money

795
00:33:46,257 --> 00:33:48,091
     and she bought a few
         burial plots

796
00:33:48,109 --> 00:33:50,760
     at Rose Hill Cemetery
    in Linden, New Jersey.

797
00:33:50,778 --> 00:33:53,280
     And it was important
that we made sure she was
         buried there.

798
00:33:53,314 --> 00:33:57,284
    She had a small funeral
     and only a handful of
    people attended.

799
00:33:57,318 --> 00:33:58,985
And it was a damn shame,

800
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:01,788
  because she should have had
 a better send-off to heaven.

801
00:34:01,823 --> 00:34:04,107
      But we were so poor
     when my mother died,

802
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:06,410
      we had to bury her
         in this thin

803
00:34:06,444 --> 00:34:09,413
 wooden cardboard-looking box
     without a headstone.

804
00:34:09,447 --> 00:34:11,665
        So years later
 when I started making money,

805
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:13,467
    I had her body exhumed
     and I had her buried

806
00:34:13,501 --> 00:34:16,119
in the most lavish coffin
     that money could buy.

807
00:34:16,137 --> 00:34:20,841
     Well, her gravestone
to this day, it sits high
    in the whole cemetery.

808
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:23,310
  And it was important for me
      to do that for her

809
00:34:23,344 --> 00:34:26,980
     <i>because I wanted</i>
  <i>to give her a resting place</i>
      <i>that was respectful.</i>

810
00:34:27,014 --> 00:34:29,683
 <i>So that in case her grandkids</i>
   <i>ever decide to come visit,</i>

811
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:32,936
   <i>they would believe in life</i>
  <i>she was a remarkable woman.</i>

812
00:34:32,970 --> 00:34:35,272
          <i>( applause )</i>

813
00:34:42,497 --> 00:34:45,982
       <i>( music playing )</i>

814
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:54,875
       <i>¶ Oh, sinner man,</i>
   <i>where you gonna run to? ¶</i>

815
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:58,595
         <i>¶ Sinner man,</i>
   <i>where you gonna run to? ¶</i>

816
00:35:00,014 --> 00:35:02,165
   <i>¶ Where you gonna run to </i>

817
00:35:02,183 --> 00:35:04,551
 <i>¶ All along them days? </i>

818
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:06,470
  <i>¶ Well, I run to the rock </i>

819
00:35:06,504 --> 00:35:10,023
       <i>¶ Please hide me,</i>
      <i>I run to the rock ¶</i>

820
00:35:10,057 --> 00:35:13,727
       <i>¶ Please hide me,</i>
      <i>I run to the rock ¶</i>

821
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:17,814
 <i>¶ Please hide me, Lord,</i>
     <i>all along them days ¶</i>

822
00:35:17,848 --> 00:35:19,699
  <i>¶ But the rock cracked... </i>

823
00:35:19,734 --> 00:35:21,701
         <i>( bell rings )</i>

824
00:35:21,736 --> 00:35:24,538
         ( applause )

825
00:35:26,857 --> 00:35:29,075
         In the ring,
    I was invincible.

826
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:32,546
     I think all my tragic
    moments prepared me for
      my rise to the top.

827
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:34,881
    I had a focus and drive
        like no other.

828
00:35:34,916 --> 00:35:36,917
    Never a moment went by
that I didn't think about

829
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:39,369
    having the heavyweight
  championship belt strapped
    around my waist.

830
00:35:39,387 --> 00:35:41,304
     It was all I was ever
permitted to think about.

831
00:35:41,339 --> 00:35:43,673
  I was gonna be a god of war
        like Cus said.

832
00:35:43,707 --> 00:35:45,308
    There was never anyone
    who was gonna beat me.

833
00:35:45,343 --> 00:35:48,812
    They would know my name
    from now until the eons
         of oblivion.

834
00:35:48,846 --> 00:35:50,981
Cus always thought he was
  preparing me for his death

835
00:35:51,015 --> 00:35:52,882
      by shoving all this
     information in my ear

836
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:55,101
even if I was in the mood
      to hear it or not.

837
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:57,988
    Countless nights
      he'd wake me up in
the middle of the night.

838
00:35:58,022 --> 00:35:59,722
     And I'm dead asleep.

839
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:01,408
    "Hey, Mike. Hey, Mike."
            "What?"

840
00:36:01,442 --> 00:36:03,443
      "Don't you what me.
          Don't you--

841
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:04,995
         You remember
    what I told you?

842
00:36:05,029 --> 00:36:06,830
 You remember, move your head,
then come back and punch

843
00:36:06,864 --> 00:36:09,732
     with bad intentions?
  Do you remember that, Mike?
        Huh? Huh?

844
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:12,252
  I'm not gonna be here long.
     I'm an old man, Mike.

845
00:36:12,286 --> 00:36:14,371
      But if you listen,
    you'll be ready.

846
00:36:14,405 --> 00:36:16,239
     You'll be best ever."

847
00:36:16,257 --> 00:36:19,042
    I knew Cus would
        eventually die.

848
00:36:19,076 --> 00:36:21,578
 He was this old stubborn man
     with a hacking cough

849
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:23,713
          who refused
      to see any doctors

850
00:36:23,747 --> 00:36:25,515
     and believed he could
  heal himself with his mind.

851
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:26,916
      "I can heal myself
         with my mind.

852
00:36:26,934 --> 00:36:28,301
    Nothing them damn
    doctors can do."

853
00:36:28,352 --> 00:36:30,053
     I'm like, "Damn, Cus.
  Let's go to the hospital."

854
00:36:30,087 --> 00:36:31,471
    "What do you know
      about some doctors?

855
00:36:31,522 --> 00:36:33,273
      Do you know doctors
    kill more people

856
00:36:33,307 --> 00:36:34,975
 than all the sports combined
in the history of sports?

857
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:37,694
      Did you know that?
     You didn't know that,
         did you, huh?

858
00:36:37,728 --> 00:36:39,946
    They'll never kill me."

859
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,934
             Man:
       <i>We love you, Cus!</i>

860
00:36:44,952 --> 00:36:48,038
            Tyson:
     <i>But Cus's death</i>
     <i>left me directionless.</i>

861
00:36:48,072 --> 00:36:50,874
      But I had a machine
     of managers, lawyers,
        and accountants

862
00:36:50,908 --> 00:36:54,127
        there to rob me
    every single step
          of the way.

863
00:36:54,161 --> 00:36:57,714
     However, things were
so plentiful at the time,

864
00:36:57,748 --> 00:37:00,333
     it was hard to notice
  their masterful deception.

865
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:03,837
    I was now the youngest
    heavyweight champion of
      the world at age 20

866
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:07,290
 <i>after defeating Trevor Berbick</i>
      <i>in just two rounds.</i>

867
00:37:07,308 --> 00:37:08,758
          Announcer:
         <i>He goes down.</i>

868
00:37:08,792 --> 00:37:10,460
       <i>He should be able</i>
      <i>to get up from this.</i>

869
00:37:10,478 --> 00:37:12,429
     <i>His legs may be shot.</i>
           <i>They are!</i>

870
00:37:12,463 --> 00:37:14,180
       <i>As Trevor Berbick</i>
          <i>falls back,</i>

871
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:16,566
   <i>I don't know if he's gonna</i>
      <i>be able to continue.</i>

872
00:37:16,601 --> 00:37:18,318
      <i>He's got the heart,</i>

873
00:37:18,352 --> 00:37:21,354
   <i>but his body won't let him</i>
   <i>do what his mind wants to.</i>

874
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:24,074
         <i>It's all over.</i>
     <i>We've got a brand-new</i>

875
00:37:24,108 --> 00:37:28,144
      <i>heavyweight champion</i>
   <i>of the world, Mike Tyson.</i>

876
00:37:28,162 --> 00:37:30,664
I was like the poster boy
         for success.

877
00:37:30,698 --> 00:37:32,365
             See?

878
00:37:33,834 --> 00:37:36,036
         I really was
        the poster boy.

879
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:39,506
  I know the NYPD wished they
could have kept this locked up
  in their archive somewhere.

880
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:41,541
    I just had to show you,
        you know,

881
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:43,826
        the irony
     is just too twisted.

882
00:37:45,162 --> 00:37:48,431
    Good picture, bad day.

883
00:37:48,466 --> 00:37:50,517
   <i>You know, really, you take</i>
      <i>away those numbers,</i>

884
00:37:50,551 --> 00:37:52,852
     <i>it could be a yearbook</i>
       <i>picture, football.</i>

885
00:37:52,887 --> 00:37:55,138
          I never had
      a yearbook picture.
          This is it.

886
00:37:55,172 --> 00:37:57,357
        But, anyway...

887
00:37:57,391 --> 00:38:00,193
     Of course, you know,
I had a few million bucks
         in the bank.

888
00:38:00,227 --> 00:38:01,945
          But still,
there's something wrong.

889
00:38:01,979 --> 00:38:04,013
         There's just
      something missing.
      I just don't know.

890
00:38:04,031 --> 00:38:07,367
    And then I found
          true love.

891
00:38:07,401 --> 00:38:10,203
        Check this out.
    ¶ Everything I do...

892
00:38:11,072 --> 00:38:13,156
             Oh...

893
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:14,908
    Sing with me, suckers.

894
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:18,044
    ¶ La la la la la,
    la la la la la ¶

895
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:22,532
         ¶ La la la la
      la la-la la-la la ¶

896
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:25,802
     ¶ Do do do do do do

897
00:38:25,836 --> 00:38:28,388
          ¶ Ooh-hh.

898
00:38:30,207 --> 00:38:32,208
         - Whoo!
         - <i>( gunshot )</i>

899
00:38:32,226 --> 00:38:34,144
             It's been torture.

900
00:38:34,178 --> 00:38:36,346
        It's been pure hell.

901
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:38,231
            It's been worse
            than anything

902
00:38:38,265 --> 00:38:40,734
- I could possibly imagine.
- Pure hell?

903
00:38:40,768 --> 00:38:42,319
        I'm not talking
        about once a week.

904
00:38:42,353 --> 00:38:45,054
     - I'm talking about
       every day has been...
     - Every day?

905
00:38:45,072 --> 00:38:47,724
    - ...some kind of battle,
      some kind of fight.
    - Shit.

906
00:38:47,742 --> 00:38:50,610
      Better mention this
'cause after Robin hears
    about this show--

907
00:38:50,661 --> 00:38:52,862
        on HBO--

908
00:38:52,896 --> 00:38:55,699
  she's gonna use it as a way
    to relaunch her career

909
00:38:55,733 --> 00:38:57,917
the same way she's been trying
     to do unsuccessfully

910
00:38:57,952 --> 00:39:00,236
    for the last 25 years.

911
00:39:00,254 --> 00:39:02,622
         - ( cheering )
         - Predict.

912
00:39:02,673 --> 00:39:05,241
        I know you guys
     didn't know anything
          about this,

913
00:39:05,259 --> 00:39:08,261
  but during our separation,
    me and Robin were
        still fucking.

914
00:39:08,295 --> 00:39:11,080
     <i>( men shouting )</i>

915
00:39:11,098 --> 00:39:12,766
            No, no,
    any kids in here?

916
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:15,101
         <i>My</i> kids
     in this motherfucker?

917
00:39:15,136 --> 00:39:17,587
             Okay.
    This one particular day

918
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:19,806
  before I go to my lawyer's
      office and tell him

919
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:22,425
  that these are golddiggers
and these are horrible people,

920
00:39:22,443 --> 00:39:26,112
I decide to go by Robin's house
         and have sex.

921
00:39:26,147 --> 00:39:27,647
     She's still my wife.
    Have sex with my wife.

922
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:29,599
 She's soon to be an ex-wife,
     but I'm trying to get

923
00:39:29,617 --> 00:39:32,652
        all I can
    before it's over, okay?

924
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:34,654
     So I go to my house--

925
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:37,073
      well, it's actually
     not really my house.

926
00:39:37,107 --> 00:39:40,960
        It's her house,
  but you know when you give
    the girl so many gifts

927
00:39:40,995 --> 00:39:42,579
    and the gifts supersede
    the price of the house,

928
00:39:42,613 --> 00:39:44,714
 you think the house is yours?
         But it's not.

929
00:39:44,749 --> 00:39:48,251
          It is not.
     So I go to the house

930
00:39:48,285 --> 00:39:51,287
 and I'm ringing the doorbell.
          Ding-dong.

931
00:39:51,305 --> 00:39:53,256
        And, of course,
        no one answers.

932
00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:55,792
    So I do it again.
          Ding-dong.

933
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:57,560
  As soon as she don't answer
        the door,

934
00:39:57,595 --> 00:40:00,597
        I head back to
my Lamborghini Countach.

935
00:40:00,631 --> 00:40:03,983
      Before I get there,
     I see a car coming up
    the winding road.

936
00:40:04,018 --> 00:40:05,769
      Blair Summit in LA.

937
00:40:05,803 --> 00:40:07,136
      I see her coming up
    the winding road.

938
00:40:07,154 --> 00:40:08,822
And the reason why I know
     it's her car is why?

939
00:40:08,856 --> 00:40:10,774
- Audience: You bought it.
- <i>I bought it.</i>

940
00:40:10,808 --> 00:40:12,692
      So as I see the car
  coming, I'm saying, "Whoa.

941
00:40:12,743 --> 00:40:15,195
     I can get this quick
stroke session in before
     I go to my lawyer's."

942
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:17,580
      <i>As she comes closer,</i>
  <i>I see in the passenger seat,</i>

943
00:40:17,615 --> 00:40:20,667
  I see this grayish-whitish
          silhouette.

944
00:40:20,701 --> 00:40:22,952
      And so I'm thinking
     it's one of her white
          girlfriends

945
00:40:22,986 --> 00:40:25,371
from that whack-ass show
     "Head of the Class."

946
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:29,292
        Oh, fuck.

947
00:40:29,326 --> 00:40:32,662
    But when the car comes
    and it's more in view,

948
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:35,849
     I notice it's not one
      of her girlfriends

949
00:40:35,883 --> 00:40:37,350
        from that show
     "Head of the Class."

950
00:40:37,384 --> 00:40:40,353
 It's a white <i>dude</i> that she's
probably giving head <i>to.</i>

951
00:40:40,387 --> 00:40:42,171
          All right?

952
00:40:42,189 --> 00:40:43,973
     You'll never believe
  who this motherfucker was.

953
00:40:44,007 --> 00:40:47,694
- Man: <i>Brad Pitt.</i>
- Why you come here if you
  know, motherfucker?

954
00:40:48,863 --> 00:40:51,180
        Yes, yes, okay.

955
00:40:51,198 --> 00:40:53,566
             Yeah,
     Brad "the shit" Pitt.

956
00:40:53,617 --> 00:40:56,703
   <i>This pretty motherfucker,</i>
           <i>all right?</i>

957
00:40:56,737 --> 00:40:58,571
         He was high.
     He was on something.

958
00:40:58,622 --> 00:41:00,623
  He had to be on some weed.
    You know I would know.

959
00:41:00,658 --> 00:41:03,576
    Like a "doobie," dude.
  It's like the doobie dudes
         are smoking.

960
00:41:03,627 --> 00:41:05,161
       <i>So he didn't know</i>
           <i>it was me.</i>

961
00:41:05,195 --> 00:41:07,747
     But when he gets out
    of the car and he sees
         my black ass,

962
00:41:07,798 --> 00:41:09,048
        you should have
         saw his face.

963
00:41:09,083 --> 00:41:11,167
      He went pre-Matrix
          on my ass.

964
00:41:11,201 --> 00:41:12,919
      'Cause "The Matrix"
    wasn't out then,

965
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:14,203
          but he did
        that same shit.

966
00:41:14,221 --> 00:41:17,257
         "Fuck, dude.
          Whoa, shit.

967
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:20,343
        Oh, shit.
     Oh, shit, Mike Tyson.

968
00:41:20,377 --> 00:41:22,879
          Fuck, Mike.
      Don't hit my face.

969
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:25,014
         Please, don't
    fucking do that.

970
00:41:26,717 --> 00:41:29,652
      I got an audition.
    We were just going over
          some lines.

971
00:41:29,687 --> 00:41:31,387
We were talking about you
        the whole time.

972
00:41:31,405 --> 00:41:34,891
      You're a good man.
  I just put in my two cents.

973
00:41:34,909 --> 00:41:37,494
    You guys could be like
the Cosbys, man. Really."

974
00:41:37,528 --> 00:41:40,113
    I'm just standing there
    looking at this pretty
     motherfucker, right?

975
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:44,751
I don't know if I'm gonna
fuck him up or fuck him.

976
00:41:44,785 --> 00:41:46,452
         I don't know
      what I'm gonna do.

977
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:48,404
I don't know if I'm gonna
          boom, boom!

978
00:41:48,422 --> 00:41:50,957
        Fuck you!
          Boom! Boom!

979
00:41:54,244 --> 00:41:56,629
         No, I wasn't
        gonna do that.

980
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:58,915
          ( panting )

981
00:41:58,933 --> 00:42:01,417
          ( laughs )

982
00:42:04,805 --> 00:42:06,890
    Oh, look at that.

983
00:42:06,924 --> 00:42:10,476
        So cool.
    They're so cool.

984
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:12,362
        It's funny when
      you think about it,

985
00:42:12,396 --> 00:42:15,281
        'cause, really,
  Brad wasn't shit back then.

986
00:42:15,316 --> 00:42:17,066
    And Robin kind of was.

987
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:19,953
But now she's a cold fart
      and he's hot shit.

988
00:42:19,987 --> 00:42:22,438
     Give me a job, Brad,
          all right?

989
00:42:22,456 --> 00:42:25,441
      Shit, even better,
  adopt me, know what I mean?

990
00:42:28,045 --> 00:42:31,464
     Plus, you never paid
that pussy bill, motherfucker.

991
00:42:31,498 --> 00:42:33,550
             Shit.

992
00:42:33,584 --> 00:42:36,135
     Oh, man. Look at me.
     I'm the dumbest nigga

993
00:42:36,170 --> 00:42:37,470
        in the history
        of dumb niggas.

994
00:42:37,504 --> 00:42:38,922
     Ain't that some shit?

995
00:42:38,956 --> 00:42:41,174
         Ain't this--
        "I got a girl!
        I got a girl!"

996
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:42,725
        Fucking stupid.

997
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:44,394
        And she's like,
      "Yeah, I got you."

998
00:42:44,428 --> 00:42:47,347
          <i>She's like,</i>
       <i>"Yeah, I got you.</i>
           <i>I got you.</i>

999
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:50,233
I got your wallet, Mike.
You're a dumb nigger, Michael.

1000
00:42:50,267 --> 00:42:52,235
      I got your wallet."

1001
00:42:55,322 --> 00:42:59,075
Look at that ridiculous weave.
  Can you believe <i>that</i> shit?

1002
00:42:59,109 --> 00:43:02,528
- That's some big Staten
  Island hair shit, right?
- Man: <i>Long Island, Mike.</i>

1003
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:04,948
        No, Long Island
    got the big hair.
 Long Island got the big hair.

1004
00:43:04,982 --> 00:43:07,083
So me and Robin was only
     married eight months,

1005
00:43:07,117 --> 00:43:10,169
  but by Hollywood standards,
     that's like 20 years.

1006
00:43:10,204 --> 00:43:14,323
         So I was 20,
          she was 21.

1007
00:43:14,341 --> 00:43:16,125
        We were young.
      I didn't know what
         I was doing.

1008
00:43:16,159 --> 00:43:19,545
    I didn't have no money,
      never had no pussy.

1009
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:22,665
    So we ain't have a clue
     what we were getting
        ourselves into,

1010
00:43:22,683 --> 00:43:26,502
    but her mama Ruth
        sure did. Yeah.

1011
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:30,673
      <i>Who I so endearingly</i>
      <i>liked to refer to as</i>
      <i>"Ruth the Ruthless."</i>

1012
00:43:30,691 --> 00:43:32,174
They tag-teamed me worse

1013
00:43:32,192 --> 00:43:35,228
than Hulk Hogan and Mr. T
     at WrestleMania, man.

1014
00:43:35,279 --> 00:43:37,780
 I tell ya, man, Rotten Robin
    and Ruth the Ruthless,

1015
00:43:37,815 --> 00:43:40,700
they jumped on my wallet
like a pack of wild dogs
    from Africa, man.

1016
00:43:40,734 --> 00:43:43,286
        You ever watch
     "National Geographic"
     and "Animal Channel"?

1017
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:46,623
  Of course, it's this animal
    that everybody's trying
    to get in Africa.

1018
00:43:46,657 --> 00:43:48,041
      He's a very slick,

1019
00:43:48,075 --> 00:43:50,576
slender, sophisticated--
      "didactyl" animal.

1020
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:53,796
He has a black last name.
Thomson gazelle. Thomson.

1021
00:43:53,831 --> 00:43:56,132
     The Thomson gazelle,
     the Thomson gazelle.

1022
00:43:56,166 --> 00:43:58,200
     The Thomson gazelle,
 you know that animal, right?

1023
00:43:58,218 --> 00:44:00,303
      So he's familiar--
     the Thomson gazelle--

1024
00:44:00,337 --> 00:44:03,006
    so the Thomson gazelle,
he's very didactyl, he's
      very sophisticated.

1025
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:06,092
        When he moves,
          he's very--

1026
00:44:06,143 --> 00:44:08,978
    "foomf, foomf, foomf."

1027
00:44:09,013 --> 00:44:11,047
    And then we have
the wild dogs of Africa.

1028
00:44:11,065 --> 00:44:12,932
    There's normally
  about nine or 14 in a pack

1029
00:44:12,983 --> 00:44:16,019
    and they're on your ass
          like this.

1030
00:44:16,053 --> 00:44:19,605
     And then, of course,
their thing is wearing you down.
          Endurance.

1031
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:21,390
         So eventually

1032
00:44:21,408 --> 00:44:23,776
the Thomson dudes dropped
        from exhaustion

1033
00:44:23,827 --> 00:44:26,663
    and then they go
      to eating his ass.
 They go right into his ass--

1034
00:44:26,697 --> 00:44:29,899
  they rip his stool out then
they rip through the rest of him
then they eat his balls--

1035
00:44:29,917 --> 00:44:33,402
        and that's what
    them ladies did to me.
 They ate my ass alive, right?

1036
00:44:36,406 --> 00:44:39,542
  I know when I said, "I do,"
I didn't know that meant
    your mama, too, right?

1037
00:44:41,045 --> 00:44:42,512
  ( mimicking Robin Givens )
"Michael, we're a package deal.

1038
00:44:42,546 --> 00:44:44,130
    You know you like
      my mother, Michael.

1039
00:44:44,181 --> 00:44:46,015
        Michael."

1040
00:44:49,103 --> 00:44:50,720
      And this experience
    really taught me

1041
00:44:50,754 --> 00:44:53,106
  that the apple doesn't fall
    too far from the tree.

1042
00:44:53,140 --> 00:44:55,441
    It is what it is.
        How do I get--

1043
00:44:55,476 --> 00:44:59,145
         <i>( Beethoven's</i>
     <i>Fifth Symphony plays )</i>

1044
00:45:01,615 --> 00:45:06,235
        I want me some
  "Michelle 'Cicely' Tyson."

1045
00:45:06,269 --> 00:45:07,937
         He's a homo.

1046
00:45:07,955 --> 00:45:09,956
     Uh, baby, subject to
         assimilation.

1047
00:45:09,990 --> 00:45:13,326
        Don King ugly.
Tyson's ugly. He a homo.

1048
00:45:13,377 --> 00:45:14,911
         Read my lips,
  I'll say it nice and slow--

1049
00:45:14,945 --> 00:45:18,881
     Michelle Cicely Tyson
          is a ho-mo.

1050
00:45:18,916 --> 00:45:20,466
        Hear me!

1051
00:45:24,671 --> 00:45:27,256
  "Mean" Mitch Green, y'all.

1052
00:45:27,290 --> 00:45:30,593
        Unfortunately,
this wouldn't be the last time
    I would run into Mitch.

1053
00:45:30,627 --> 00:45:32,145
    I would see him again.

1054
00:45:32,179 --> 00:45:34,680
     This time it will be
 at 4:00 a.m. in the morning.

1055
00:45:34,732 --> 00:45:36,766
        At Harlem
      at the most famous

1056
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:39,652
         and luxurious
     Dapper Dan boutique.

1057
00:45:41,471 --> 00:45:43,523
  We up there getting fitted
  for a beautiful, tailored--

1058
00:45:43,574 --> 00:45:45,191
     no, it wasn't really
    a tailored suit.

1059
00:45:45,242 --> 00:45:48,661
It was this bullshit-ass,
ridiculous white leather jacket

1060
00:45:48,695 --> 00:45:51,864
 with "Don't Believe the Hype"
      glued on the back.

1061
00:45:53,333 --> 00:45:56,085
        And I got these
     white, tight leather
      Daisy Duke shorts.

1062
00:45:58,422 --> 00:46:00,623
        Don't judge me,
         motherfucker.

1063
00:46:00,657 --> 00:46:02,425
  I had good legs back then,
         motherfucker.

1064
00:46:02,459 --> 00:46:04,660
      I liked to whip it
         and whip it.

1065
00:46:07,014 --> 00:46:10,049
      So this is New York
  and most of you are black,

1066
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:12,101
    so you know about
          Dapper Dan.

1067
00:46:12,136 --> 00:46:14,020
And for those who don't,

1068
00:46:14,054 --> 00:46:17,673
        Dapper Dan was
      the man back then.

1069
00:46:17,691 --> 00:46:21,844
     Every hip-hop artist/
drug dealer/killer/kidnapper/--

1070
00:46:21,862 --> 00:46:24,397
whatever you slash with,
    you're up there.

1071
00:46:24,448 --> 00:46:26,849
So it's not really weird
    to see people up there

1072
00:46:26,867 --> 00:46:28,901
at the wee hours of the night,
    of course, right?

1073
00:46:28,952 --> 00:46:31,904
  So I'm there feeling good,

1074
00:46:31,955 --> 00:46:33,790
    all of a sudden,

1075
00:46:33,824 --> 00:46:35,658
    my cool is interrupted

1076
00:46:35,692 --> 00:46:37,877
when this uncouth motherfucker
        walks in the--

1077
00:46:37,911 --> 00:46:39,579
    looking just like this.

1078
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:41,214
He didn't have the shorts
  and the gloves, of course,

1079
00:46:41,248 --> 00:46:43,966
but he had the sweatpants
      and he had no shirt

1080
00:46:44,001 --> 00:46:46,702
    and he had the hairdo.

1081
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:49,138
        I go here
and I'm trying on clothes

1082
00:46:49,173 --> 00:46:51,641
     and Mitch comes in--
and then when Mitch comes in...

1083
00:46:51,675 --> 00:46:53,810
        Mitch comes in
          like this.

1084
00:46:53,844 --> 00:46:55,344
          <i>( laughter )</i>

1085
00:46:55,378 --> 00:46:58,064
    "Bitch-ass nigga,
    what the fuck you doing
      in my neighborhood,

1086
00:46:58,098 --> 00:46:59,381
     you bitch-ass nigga?!

1087
00:46:59,399 --> 00:47:02,885
      You "Cicely Tyson"
     homo-ass-bitch nigga.

1088
00:47:04,321 --> 00:47:06,155
    What-- you wanna jump?

1089
00:47:06,190 --> 00:47:08,274
      Don't jump, nigga.
         Don't jump--

1090
00:47:08,325 --> 00:47:09,892
    don't do this, nigga."

1091
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:12,328
          And, um...

1092
00:47:14,448 --> 00:47:16,165
         I'm trying to
    stay cool, right,

1093
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:19,702
        because I'm in
    this white world.

1094
00:47:19,736 --> 00:47:21,370
      I got endorsements.

1095
00:47:21,404 --> 00:47:23,122
    I got Pepsi-Cola.

1096
00:47:23,173 --> 00:47:25,074
      Not now, back then.

1097
00:47:25,092 --> 00:47:26,792
         I got Kodak.

1098
00:47:26,844 --> 00:47:28,344
      Not now, back then.

1099
00:47:28,378 --> 00:47:31,514
     I got Bank of America
before it was Bank of America.

1100
00:47:31,548 --> 00:47:33,549
      Not now, back then.

1101
00:47:33,583 --> 00:47:35,051
 'Cause white people love me.

1102
00:47:35,085 --> 00:47:37,920
      Not now, back then.

1103
00:47:40,390 --> 00:47:44,060
      So I don't got time
      to fuck around with
      a $2 nigga, right?

1104
00:47:45,562 --> 00:47:47,530
     If you have any kind
      of success anywhere
         in the world,

1105
00:47:47,564 --> 00:47:49,565
     you got some fuckin'
    Jewish influence.

1106
00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:52,535
You got these Jewish managers,
lawyers, and accountants
        and shit.

1107
00:47:52,569 --> 00:47:54,270
        And they ain't
     no big motherfuckers,

1108
00:47:54,288 --> 00:47:57,490
but every time I see them
    in verbal altercations,

1109
00:47:57,541 --> 00:47:59,775
         and they says
     some slick shit from
the side of their mouth,

1110
00:47:59,793 --> 00:48:02,778
        they never got
their ass whipped or hurt
      or anything, right?

1111
00:48:02,796 --> 00:48:06,115
     So I thought I'd try
      this shit on Mitch

1112
00:48:06,133 --> 00:48:08,885
     mixed with my little
     Brooklyn shit, right?

1113
00:48:08,919 --> 00:48:10,670
         So I say, um,

1114
00:48:13,123 --> 00:48:15,291
         "Now, Mitch,
      what are you doing?

1115
00:48:16,727 --> 00:48:18,511
     Now trust me, Mitch,
         by all means,

1116
00:48:18,562 --> 00:48:21,981
    I don't really believe
     this is advantageous
        to your health.

1117
00:48:22,015 --> 00:48:25,134
        I already
     kicked your ass now.

1118
00:48:25,152 --> 00:48:28,738
    You need to proceed to
the nearest exit immediately."

1119
00:48:28,772 --> 00:48:32,408
  And it didn't work for me.
Why did I say that shit?

1120
00:48:32,442 --> 00:48:34,110
Why did I say that shit?

1121
00:48:34,144 --> 00:48:36,812
    He said, "What, bitch?!
Nigga, you ain't beat me,
            nigga!

1122
00:48:36,830 --> 00:48:38,831
        That Don King--
    he ain't give me
    no per diem, man.

1123
00:48:38,865 --> 00:48:41,650
  I ain't have no food, man.
How am I gonna fight with
    no food, you bitch-ass,

1124
00:48:41,668 --> 00:48:44,486
    dick-sucking fool, you
 Tyson-ass-bitch-ass-ho nigga.

1125
00:48:44,504 --> 00:48:46,455
             Huh?"

1126
00:48:49,659 --> 00:48:51,961
          I have this
     speech coach, right--

1127
00:48:51,995 --> 00:48:54,263
 and this is one of the words
 that we worked on and stuff--

1128
00:48:54,298 --> 00:48:58,551
    so suddenly I had
         an epiphany.

1129
00:48:58,602 --> 00:49:01,520
             I had
      an epiphany, right?

1130
00:49:01,555 --> 00:49:03,356
      I had an epiphany.

1131
00:49:03,390 --> 00:49:06,809
  So I say, "I am Mike Tyson,
right, the baddest motherfucker
     on the planet, right,

1132
00:49:06,843 --> 00:49:08,611
         I do not have
      to take this shit."

1133
00:49:08,645 --> 00:49:10,696
     All that white world
 that I wanted to be a part of

1134
00:49:10,731 --> 00:49:12,615
just went out the window.

1135
00:49:12,649 --> 00:49:15,517
        I just get mad
        and Mitch said,
      "Fuck you, faggot!"

1136
00:49:15,535 --> 00:49:17,820
  And it just slipped and I--
        ( yells )

1137
00:49:17,854 --> 00:49:19,855
     Right? But it didn't
        turn out cool.

1138
00:49:19,873 --> 00:49:22,875
        I broke my hand
    on this gorilla's face.

1139
00:49:24,745 --> 00:49:27,029
      And listen, right,

1140
00:49:27,047 --> 00:49:29,165
        you know,
     after all that stuff,

1141
00:49:29,199 --> 00:49:31,033
I really don't even like
to use the word "gorilla"

1142
00:49:31,051 --> 00:49:34,086
    concerning a black man,
      but come on, guys,
    just look at him.

1143
00:49:34,137 --> 00:49:36,088
        I'm gonna
      leave it up to you.

1144
00:49:36,139 --> 00:49:39,091
        Gorilla,
      orangutan, baboon,

1145
00:49:39,142 --> 00:49:42,561
spider monkey, you pick.
  It ain't on me, all right?

1146
00:49:42,596 --> 00:49:44,347
So this is what you never
     knew about the fight.

1147
00:49:44,381 --> 00:49:47,049
      You all knew about
the altercation, but this
is what you didn't know--

1148
00:49:47,067 --> 00:49:49,652
    Mitch was high on
      some powerful shit

1149
00:49:49,686 --> 00:49:52,554
     they gave him, like,
     alien-like strength,
          all right?

1150
00:49:55,158 --> 00:49:57,493
          Angel dust.
  Yeah, he was high as a kite
        on angel dust.

1151
00:49:57,527 --> 00:50:00,246
        I'm laying some
    beautiful combinations
    on this brother, right.

1152
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:01,697
    I'm laying these
      beautiful combin--

1153
00:50:02,783 --> 00:50:04,583
        But, um,
      he doesn't go down.

1154
00:50:04,618 --> 00:50:06,902
    "Weebles wobble,
  but they don't fall down."

1155
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:08,504
        Remember that?
         That's Mitch.

1156
00:50:08,538 --> 00:50:11,173
  So I'm opening up on Mitch
and it's like the karate movie.

1157
00:50:11,208 --> 00:50:12,741
         I'm moving--

1158
00:50:12,759 --> 00:50:15,044
and Mitch is not going--
but he's not going down.

1159
00:50:15,078 --> 00:50:17,680
 And he's just going like this
and he's not going down.

1160
00:50:17,714 --> 00:50:19,765
Shit's not looking good for me,
      so I have to resort

1161
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:22,584
        to my Bruce Lee
      "Enter the Dragon,"

1162
00:50:22,602 --> 00:50:25,187
        Regent Theatre
      on Nostrand Avenue,

1163
00:50:25,222 --> 00:50:27,606
    across the street from
the bank, roundhouse kick

1164
00:50:27,641 --> 00:50:29,475
     on this motherfucker,
            right?

1165
00:50:29,526 --> 00:50:31,277
        You know that--
 all right, but listen, right,

1166
00:50:31,311 --> 00:50:34,730
     I see the people are
 very excited, the expectation
      is all in the air.

1167
00:50:34,764 --> 00:50:37,650
     Keep in mind, though,
  the kick that you're about
        to witness now

1168
00:50:37,701 --> 00:50:41,237
     is not gonna resemble
the kick from 1988, okay?

1169
00:50:41,271 --> 00:50:43,823
    So Mitch comes, right--

1170
00:50:43,874 --> 00:50:45,658
    so Mitch comes--

1171
00:50:45,709 --> 00:50:47,993
      "Fuck you, nigga!"
             Boom!

1172
00:50:48,045 --> 00:50:50,779
     Mitch is down again.
      He's fucking down.

1173
00:50:50,797 --> 00:50:52,498
        He fucking down

1174
00:50:52,549 --> 00:50:53,999
     and he's not moving.

1175
00:50:54,051 --> 00:50:55,617
     He's not getting up.

1176
00:50:55,635 --> 00:50:59,255
  I got this driver/bodyguard
  that's with me at the time,

1177
00:50:59,289 --> 00:51:01,424
    but he's never with me
 when the fight's going down.

1178
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:07,012
        "Yo, Mike, man,
      I think you killed
this motherfucker, man."

1179
00:51:07,064 --> 00:51:10,232
          And then--

1180
00:51:10,267 --> 00:51:12,685
  of course I have to go back
to this Jewish etiquette shit.

1181
00:51:12,736 --> 00:51:14,487
  I go, "Fuck that shit, Tom.

1182
00:51:14,521 --> 00:51:17,606
  It was inevitable this shit
     was going down, man."

1183
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:19,308
         And Tom goes,

1184
00:51:19,326 --> 00:51:23,079
    "Fuck that, Ike.
 Man, this nigga gonna hit you
with that lawsuit, man."

1185
00:51:23,113 --> 00:51:26,115
     And then this is back
 to my Jewish etiquette shit.

1186
00:51:26,149 --> 00:51:28,817
 "Fucking Tom, do you believe
      there's a court in
    the fucking land

1187
00:51:28,835 --> 00:51:30,819
    that will believe
this fucking baboon, man?

1188
00:51:30,837 --> 00:51:33,489
    Are you fucking crazy?"
    But I'm really scared.

1189
00:51:33,507 --> 00:51:36,625
 I'm talking that tough shit,
    but I'm really scared.

1190
00:51:36,659 --> 00:51:37,960
      I'm really scared.

1191
00:51:37,994 --> 00:51:39,995
    And my mind says,
     "Please, I hope this
         nigga moves."

1192
00:51:40,013 --> 00:51:43,665
         And then this
  "Night of the Living Dead,"
    Jason, Michael Myers--

1193
00:51:43,683 --> 00:51:45,217
    he pops up and he says,

1194
00:51:45,268 --> 00:51:48,053
      "Fuck you, faggot!"
and hits me in the balls.

1195
00:51:51,174 --> 00:51:52,558
         I went "Ugh!"

1196
00:51:52,609 --> 00:51:54,510
    And then I said,
  "Fuck that Bruce Lee shit,

1197
00:51:54,528 --> 00:51:56,529
      it's time for WWE,
      Bruno Sammartino--

1198
00:51:56,563 --> 00:51:58,697
          and it's...
          ( yelling )

1199
00:52:02,685 --> 00:52:04,737
     And I was gonna bite
this motherfucker, right,

1200
00:52:04,788 --> 00:52:07,406
    but, um, not this
      dirty motherfucker.

1201
00:52:07,457 --> 00:52:09,742
    'Cause I'll bite
     a motherfucker before
God gets the news, right,

1202
00:52:09,793 --> 00:52:12,912
        but he had that
green shit and grey shit
    coming with his blood.

1203
00:52:12,963 --> 00:52:14,880
      <i>I didn't wanna catch</i>
       <i>the "West Nine"--</i>

1204
00:52:14,915 --> 00:52:17,917
            I mean,
    West Nile virus.

1205
00:52:17,968 --> 00:52:20,836
          - <i>Shit.</i>
          - West nine?

1206
00:52:20,870 --> 00:52:24,089
        I'm walking to
    my yellow canary

1207
00:52:24,141 --> 00:52:26,892
convertible Rolls-Royce.

1208
00:52:26,927 --> 00:52:30,146
        350, 350,000--
    Puffy didn't have
        350 back then.

1209
00:52:30,180 --> 00:52:32,398
         He does now.
 He didn't have it back then.

1210
00:52:32,432 --> 00:52:35,050
    I get in the car
     and Tom's in the car
          and I say--

1211
00:52:35,068 --> 00:52:37,719
        I've still got
      my Jewish etiquette
    with me, though--

1212
00:52:37,737 --> 00:52:40,055
     I got Jew etiquette,
        so I go,

1213
00:52:40,073 --> 00:52:42,908
          "Tom, um--

1214
00:52:42,943 --> 00:52:45,694
     will you please be--
     will you please, um,

1215
00:52:45,728 --> 00:52:47,780
        pursue the road
     to the emergency room

1216
00:52:47,831 --> 00:52:49,865
    because I believe
 I have a hairline fracture."

1217
00:52:49,899 --> 00:52:52,701
And Tom goes, "Fuck, man!
    You crazy motherfucker!

1218
00:52:52,735 --> 00:52:54,920
Mitch is on the back of the car!
    Mitch is on the wheel!"

1219
00:52:54,955 --> 00:52:57,072
    And this is not a lie,
    he woke up again.

1220
00:52:57,090 --> 00:52:58,740
    He-- I don't know how--

1221
00:52:58,758 --> 00:53:01,410
          he woke up,
  he's on the back of my car
     and he's on the wheel

1222
00:53:01,428 --> 00:53:03,212
        and he's,
      "Fuck you, faggot!

1223
00:53:03,246 --> 00:53:06,015
          You faggot!
 I'm going to kill you, homo!"

1224
00:53:06,049 --> 00:53:07,466
     So he's back there--

1225
00:53:07,517 --> 00:53:10,019
  he does an alien-like leap
      and he disappears.

1226
00:53:10,053 --> 00:53:13,722
  He goes up and disappears.
     Me and Tom are like,
    "Oh, shit! Fuck!"

1227
00:53:13,756 --> 00:53:15,808
        And comes down
    and we're scared
    to get out of the car.

1228
00:53:15,859 --> 00:53:19,428
    And he comes down
    on my side view mirror

1229
00:53:19,446 --> 00:53:20,696
    and rips it off.

1230
00:53:20,730 --> 00:53:22,097
            I said,
        "That's 30 Gs."

1231
00:53:22,115 --> 00:53:24,283
      It has to be 30 Gs
    if the car's 350.

1232
00:53:24,317 --> 00:53:26,402
        350,000,
      it has to be 30 Gs.

1233
00:53:26,436 --> 00:53:28,237
And I'm saying to myself,
            "Fuck,"

1234
00:53:28,271 --> 00:53:31,207
    but I'm still in
    Jewish etiquette mode,
but I'm mad as a motherfucker.

1235
00:53:31,241 --> 00:53:35,044
      And I say-- I say,
 "Tom, will you be kind enough

1236
00:53:35,078 --> 00:53:37,630
         to wait here
patiently as I go outside
      and confront Mitch

1237
00:53:37,664 --> 00:53:39,665
about this motherfucking
      side view mirror?"

1238
00:53:39,716 --> 00:53:42,001
    And I come out the car
          like this.

1239
00:53:42,052 --> 00:53:44,420
     And I jump and I grab
    this motherfucker

1240
00:53:44,454 --> 00:53:46,288
      and I just reel in
         that Jheri--

1241
00:53:46,306 --> 00:53:48,674
    I'm reeling in--

1242
00:53:48,725 --> 00:53:50,292
          excuse me,
     I'm from Brownsville.

1243
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:52,561
You know we got the lisp.
         "Jheri curl."

1244
00:53:52,596 --> 00:53:54,430
        I'm reeling in
    the Jheri curl--

1245
00:53:54,464 --> 00:53:56,015
        I'm reeling in
        the Jheri curl

1246
00:53:56,066 --> 00:53:58,767
    and then the proverbial
        Ralph Kramden--

1247
00:53:58,801 --> 00:54:01,270
          boom, zoom,
  to the motherfucking moon.

1248
00:54:01,304 --> 00:54:03,155
             Boom!

1249
00:54:03,189 --> 00:54:05,641
   <i>( sound effect whistles )</i>

1250
00:54:07,027 --> 00:54:09,161
         I'm waiting.

1251
00:54:10,196 --> 00:54:11,664
             Boom!

1252
00:54:11,698 --> 00:54:13,866
  Mitch is down again, right?

1253
00:54:13,917 --> 00:54:16,151
    Sometimes you hit
    your head once-- boom!

1254
00:54:16,169 --> 00:54:18,370
    On the concrete--
      on the floor 'cause
    you had a fight--

1255
00:54:18,421 --> 00:54:20,339
      boom-- sometimes--
      boom, you're dead.

1256
00:54:20,373 --> 00:54:22,041
         Motherfucker
    ain't breathing,

1257
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:24,960
     but this is something
    that is really uncanny.

1258
00:54:24,994 --> 00:54:27,546
Sometimes you hear the-- boom!
     And then it bounce up
     and hit again. Boom!

1259
00:54:27,597 --> 00:54:29,381
And then he wakes up and
  he starts throwing punches.

1260
00:54:29,432 --> 00:54:30,999
    I don't know why,
but it always happens that way.

1261
00:54:31,017 --> 00:54:32,501
    You hit it twice,
          you get up.

1262
00:54:32,519 --> 00:54:34,169
But when Mitch came down,

1263
00:54:34,187 --> 00:54:36,355
    he just did one-- boom!

1264
00:54:36,389 --> 00:54:37,839
        And the breath
     from his air came up

1265
00:54:37,857 --> 00:54:40,776
    and he shit on himself
    a little, right?

1266
00:54:40,810 --> 00:54:43,345
         And my mother
     always told me that--

1267
00:54:43,363 --> 00:54:45,364
     ah-- that's your soul
        going to Jesus.

1268
00:54:45,398 --> 00:54:50,235
          I had to do
     my Jewish/Brooklyn--

1269
00:54:50,287 --> 00:54:52,154
"See, Mitch, I told you.

1270
00:54:52,188 --> 00:54:56,041
     This was going to be
      fucking detrimental
        to your health.

1271
00:54:56,076 --> 00:54:58,077
Now you forced me to put
 a sign in your eye that says,

1272
00:54:58,128 --> 00:55:01,497
          'Closed for
     the fucking season.'"

1273
00:55:01,531 --> 00:55:04,550
          This again,
this wouldn't be the last time
I see this motherfucker.

1274
00:55:04,584 --> 00:55:07,503
    I'm in Harlem now
 with this Afrocentric sister.

1275
00:55:07,537 --> 00:55:10,005
    You know, who always--
  Sister Egypt is her name--

1276
00:55:10,039 --> 00:55:13,642
        with the turban
         on the head.

1277
00:55:13,677 --> 00:55:16,261
      The flowing dress.
Likes to be very conservative.

1278
00:55:16,313 --> 00:55:18,880
      Don't want to show
     the curves and stuff.

1279
00:55:18,898 --> 00:55:20,716
      But when she moves,
     her body would, too.

1280
00:55:20,734 --> 00:55:21,900
  She just couldn't help it.

1281
00:55:21,935 --> 00:55:24,687
          Excuse me.
    Thank you, Gwen.

1282
00:55:24,721 --> 00:55:27,740
        You remember--
    it was like '88--

1283
00:55:27,774 --> 00:55:29,725
    the way Harlem is now,

1284
00:55:29,743 --> 00:55:33,696
      they got, you know,
     linen cloths outside
          on tables.

1285
00:55:33,730 --> 00:55:35,164
     You eat outside now.

1286
00:55:35,198 --> 00:55:37,666
    But they tried--
  this is like the prototype
        before--

1287
00:55:37,701 --> 00:55:39,835
      to see if the shit
        was gonna work.

1288
00:55:39,869 --> 00:55:42,338
I'm sitting at the table

1289
00:55:42,372 --> 00:55:45,541
    and from the side
          of my eye,

1290
00:55:45,575 --> 00:55:48,927
      I see this big guy
 with some big hair on a bike.

1291
00:55:48,962 --> 00:55:52,881
     Not a Harley-Davidson
or a Ducati, but a bike,
         and no shirt.

1292
00:55:52,915 --> 00:55:54,133
        This shit just
    don't look right.

1293
00:55:54,184 --> 00:55:56,802
          So I turn,
it's fucking Mitch Green.

1294
00:55:58,755 --> 00:56:02,441
         Mitch Green's
    around 6'5"/6'6",

1295
00:56:02,475 --> 00:56:04,143
      but with his hair--

1296
00:56:04,194 --> 00:56:07,479
 the hair's like 6'12"/7-foot,
        you pick.

1297
00:56:07,530 --> 00:56:11,033
 Anyway, he's on a bike going,
      "One, two, woomp."

1298
00:56:11,067 --> 00:56:12,651
And I'm saying to myself,
    "Mitch is here."

1299
00:56:12,702 --> 00:56:13,869
        And I'm saying,
      "If he goes here--"

1300
00:56:13,903 --> 00:56:15,704
     just like if the cops
      are looking for you

1301
00:56:15,739 --> 00:56:18,106
      and you can't move
  right quick 'cause they'll
spot you if you get up--

1302
00:56:18,124 --> 00:56:20,125
  I said, "If Mitch go here,
    he'll go by that block,

1303
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:21,777
          and I know
        he'll be gone."

1304
00:56:21,795 --> 00:56:23,245
        But he doesn't,
he gets here and he looks

1305
00:56:23,279 --> 00:56:25,748
          and his eye
        catches my eye.

1306
00:56:25,782 --> 00:56:28,634
 And he's not sure if it's me,
    but he went like this.

1307
00:56:28,668 --> 00:56:32,805
        And Mitch goes,
      "Foom, foom, foom,
         foom, whoa."

1308
00:56:32,839 --> 00:56:34,306
    I knew Mitch for years.

1309
00:56:34,340 --> 00:56:36,225
    The most rational thing
     I ever saw Mitch do--

1310
00:56:36,259 --> 00:56:38,927
          he stopped,
     he got off the bike,

1311
00:56:38,961 --> 00:56:41,930
          and he put
      the kickstand down
          real easy.

1312
00:56:41,964 --> 00:56:44,016
     <i>That's the only</i>
     <i>transportation he had.</i>

1313
00:56:45,568 --> 00:56:47,936
    So he was very careful.

1314
00:56:47,970 --> 00:56:49,488
He comes to the maître d'

1315
00:56:49,522 --> 00:56:51,807
    and Mitch goes...
          ( groans )

1316
00:56:51,825 --> 00:56:53,909
      And the girl go...
          ( groans )

1317
00:56:53,943 --> 00:56:56,645
          See, Mitch
    is a Neanderthal

1318
00:56:56,663 --> 00:56:59,665
  and I am half-Neanderthal,
    so I knew what he said.

1319
00:56:59,699 --> 00:57:00,866
        The girl didn't
        understand him.

1320
00:57:00,917 --> 00:57:04,152
    What he said was,
"Is that Mike Tyson over there?"

1321
00:57:04,170 --> 00:57:06,872
     The girl stepped back
and she pointed to me and said,

1322
00:57:06,923 --> 00:57:10,342
         "Hey, Champ.
 Mr. Green wants to see you."

1323
00:57:10,376 --> 00:57:12,094
    And once she said that,
        he said,

1324
00:57:12,128 --> 00:57:14,496
        "You see,
you motherfucking faggot,

1325
00:57:14,514 --> 00:57:16,832
     homo-bitch-ass nigga.
    Fuck you, faggot.

1326
00:57:16,850 --> 00:57:18,634
Why you snuff me and run?

1327
00:57:18,668 --> 00:57:21,603
Why you snuff me, nigga?
     You bitch-ass nigga.
        You snuffed me.

1328
00:57:21,638 --> 00:57:25,774
     Motherfucking Tyson,
          homo nigga.

1329
00:57:25,809 --> 00:57:28,277
          I tell you,
you ain't fucked with me.

1330
00:57:28,311 --> 00:57:29,645
      You ain't beat me,
     I ain't have no food.

1331
00:57:29,679 --> 00:57:31,897
     Fucking you and that
      bitch-ass Don King.

1332
00:57:31,948 --> 00:57:33,866
        You're sucking
    his dick, nigga.

1333
00:57:33,900 --> 00:57:35,567
     How am I gonna fight
         with no food?

1334
00:57:35,618 --> 00:57:37,703
How am I gonna fight with
 no motherfucking food, nigga?

1335
00:57:37,737 --> 00:57:40,522
I ain't got no per diem, nigga.
    I'll fuck you, nigga."

1336
00:57:40,540 --> 00:57:42,958
  So I'm eating this steak--

1337
00:57:42,992 --> 00:57:44,376
    I'm not a vegan--
      I'm eating a steak.

1338
00:57:44,410 --> 00:57:47,496
    I'm saying to myself--
          I'm saying,

1339
00:57:47,530 --> 00:57:50,582
    "I'm about to gut Mitch
    like a fish right now."

1340
00:57:50,633 --> 00:57:53,836
      I had Sister Egypt,
      she said, "No! No!

1341
00:57:56,038 --> 00:57:58,090
        Be cool.
 Don't play yourself, brother.

1342
00:57:58,141 --> 00:58:01,810
 That's that white man's trap
to get you in that white man's
    prison, brother.

1343
00:58:01,845 --> 00:58:03,545
You worth too much there,
        brother.

1344
00:58:03,563 --> 00:58:05,981
        I'll fight him.
     You're worth too much
        there, brother.

1345
00:58:06,015 --> 00:58:10,352
    That's that white man's
    plantation nigga,
         right there."

1346
00:58:10,386 --> 00:58:13,889
So my life is unraveling.
 That's the right word, right?
          Unraveling.

1347
00:58:13,907 --> 00:58:16,608
          Mitch Green
 and the street fight happens,

1348
00:58:16,659 --> 00:58:19,695
 then Robin filed for divorce
    later that year.

1349
00:58:19,729 --> 00:58:21,229
          Yeah, yeah.

1350
00:58:21,247 --> 00:58:22,731
    And then I make a deal
    with the devil--

1351
00:58:22,749 --> 00:58:25,167
      I sign my life away
         to Don King.

1352
00:58:25,201 --> 00:58:27,569
      ( mimics Don King )
      "Nyuk, nyuk, nyuk.
    Only in America."

1353
00:58:27,587 --> 00:58:29,838
    Fuck you, nigga,
        fuck you.

1354
00:58:29,873 --> 00:58:32,124
  All right, there's nothing
      American about you.

1355
00:58:32,175 --> 00:58:35,511
You pull his pants down,
 you'll see a stamp on his ass
    says, "Made in China."

1356
00:58:37,630 --> 00:58:41,099
  So my divorce is finalized
      on Valentine's Day.

1357
00:58:41,134 --> 00:58:44,085
 More like St. Valentine's Day
    Massacre, right?

1358
00:58:44,103 --> 00:58:46,188
Then there were all these
    emotional issues,

1359
00:58:46,222 --> 00:58:48,690
  my pussy supply's cut off,

1360
00:58:48,725 --> 00:58:51,226
  and Don has me set to fight

1361
00:58:51,260 --> 00:58:53,362
     Frank Bruno two weeks
          after that.

1362
00:58:53,396 --> 00:58:56,982
      In spite of it all,
 all the turmoil and adversity
          in my life,

1363
00:58:57,033 --> 00:58:58,433
      I still maintained

1364
00:58:58,451 --> 00:59:01,203
  my Heavyweight Championship
    with a knockout.

1365
00:59:01,237 --> 00:59:02,905
      A few weeks later,
    I go to Atlantic City,

1366
00:59:02,939 --> 00:59:05,457
         I fight Carl
     "The Truth" Williams,
     find out he's a lie.

1367
00:59:05,491 --> 00:59:07,326
        I knock him out
        in 93 seconds.

1368
00:59:07,377 --> 00:59:09,077
      Then I fly to Japan

1369
00:59:09,111 --> 00:59:11,496
        to fight
    James "Buster" Douglas.

1370
00:59:11,548 --> 00:59:12,915
      Check this one out.

1371
00:59:12,949 --> 00:59:15,500
         Commentator:
     <i>...by Buster Douglas!</i>
         <i>Look at this!</i>

1372
00:59:15,552 --> 00:59:17,419
          <i>He's knocked</i>
     <i>Mike Tyson down!</i>

1373
00:59:17,453 --> 00:59:20,088
       <i>For the first time</i>
         <i>in his career</i>

1374
00:59:20,122 --> 00:59:22,507
           <i>Mike Tyson</i>
     <i>hits the canvas!</i>

1375
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:23,842
      <i>He's in big trouble!</i>

1376
00:59:23,893 --> 00:59:25,627
       <i>He may not be able</i>
          <i>to recover!</i>

1377
00:59:25,645 --> 00:59:29,464
  <i>It's up to seven and eight!</i>
 <i>He's not gonna make it!</i>

1378
00:59:29,482 --> 00:59:32,634
         <i>Unbelievable!</i>

1379
00:59:34,303 --> 00:59:36,822
    Bad day at the office.

1380
00:59:38,107 --> 00:59:39,858
You know, I didn't think
    I was gonna lose,

1381
00:59:39,909 --> 00:59:42,694
    but I didn't know
 how I thought I could've won.

1382
00:59:42,745 --> 00:59:45,080
        I wasn't
      training properly.

1383
00:59:45,114 --> 00:59:46,999
    I was beating everybody
even though I wasn't training.

1384
00:59:47,033 --> 00:59:48,617
     I was supposed to be
         practicing--

1385
00:59:48,651 --> 00:59:50,202
and this is another word
    I learned, too--

1386
00:59:50,253 --> 00:59:51,503
          abstinence.

1387
00:59:51,537 --> 00:59:52,821
You know, I couldn't even
        say abstinence,

1388
00:59:52,839 --> 00:59:55,757
        how was I gonna
      practice it, right?

1389
00:59:55,792 --> 00:59:57,509
That's some folklore tale

1390
00:59:57,543 --> 00:59:59,678
that you're not supposed to be
 with any girl before a fight.

1391
00:59:59,712 --> 01:00:02,297
Nobody believes in that stuff.
  Cus didn't believe in that
     and I didn't either.

1392
01:00:02,331 --> 01:00:05,717
         Cus would go,
      "That's just a form
          of control.

1393
01:00:05,768 --> 01:00:09,638
  If they can get you to stop
 having sex, they can get you
      to stop breathing."

1394
01:00:09,672 --> 01:00:13,442
    And of course I didn't
 wanna stop breathing, right?

1395
01:00:13,476 --> 01:00:14,943
    But to be honest,

1396
01:00:14,978 --> 01:00:17,062
      I actually knocked
      Buster Douglas out
     in the eighth round.

1397
01:00:17,113 --> 01:00:19,865
It was a 13-second count.
     You see for yourself.

1398
01:00:19,899 --> 01:00:21,316
         Check it out.

1399
01:00:21,350 --> 01:00:25,120
     <i>Oh, one, two, three--</i>

1400
01:00:25,154 --> 01:00:26,705
          <i>see the guy</i>
      <i>in the white gloves?</i>

1401
01:00:26,739 --> 01:00:28,790
    Four, five, six,

1402
01:00:28,825 --> 01:00:31,877
      seven, eight, nine,

1403
01:00:31,911 --> 01:00:34,129
            10, 11,

1404
01:00:34,163 --> 01:00:37,582
            12, 13.

1405
01:00:37,634 --> 01:00:40,252
Un-fucking-lucky number.

1406
01:00:40,303 --> 01:00:41,837
    I had that coming to me

1407
01:00:41,871 --> 01:00:43,388
    because I was a spoiled
        little schmuck.

1408
01:00:43,423 --> 01:00:46,224
      I just left Japan,
    it was an all-time low.

1409
01:00:46,259 --> 01:00:48,560
      I took a vicious--
my first professional defeat--

1410
01:00:48,594 --> 01:00:50,429
    and a bad one at that.

1411
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:51,763
    And then a week later,

1412
01:00:51,814 --> 01:00:55,017
    my sister Denise,
    she just suddenly dies.

1413
01:00:55,051 --> 01:00:58,487
 <i>And I remember talking to her</i>
     <i>the night before</i>

1414
01:00:58,521 --> 01:01:01,389
     <i>and she was telling me</i>
     <i>I need to see a doctor</i>

1415
01:01:01,407 --> 01:01:03,608
        because my eye
      was really damaged

1416
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:07,496
      and Buster gave me
     a really bad beating.

1417
01:01:07,530 --> 01:01:09,781
  And then the next morning,
      she was just gone.

1418
01:01:09,832 --> 01:01:11,833
      My sister Denise--

1419
01:01:11,868 --> 01:01:14,235
     but known to everyone
      in the neighborhood
         as "Niecey"--

1420
01:01:14,253 --> 01:01:17,172
    took on a maternal role
    in my life after
        my mother died.

1421
01:01:17,206 --> 01:01:20,092
    She was the only person
     not afraid to put me
        in deep check.

1422
01:01:20,126 --> 01:01:22,377
  She was loved by everybody
     in the neighborhood.

1423
01:01:22,411 --> 01:01:24,412
    She just had that fun,
    gregarious personality

1424
01:01:24,430 --> 01:01:26,915
  that everybody just wanted
     to have around them.

1425
01:01:26,933 --> 01:01:29,518
    Niecey was buried with
  the honors of a dignitary.

1426
01:01:29,552 --> 01:01:32,521
      I couldn't believe
     hundreds of people--
     thousands of people--

1427
01:01:32,555 --> 01:01:35,423
     they just kept coming
      and they just came
        to the funeral.

1428
01:01:35,441 --> 01:01:37,142
      I was overwhelmed.

1429
01:01:37,193 --> 01:01:40,112
And I made sure she was buried
      close to my mother.

1430
01:01:40,146 --> 01:01:42,447
      You know, I may not
    always been a good son

1431
01:01:42,482 --> 01:01:43,865
          or brother
    for that matter,

1432
01:01:43,900 --> 01:01:46,151
    but I made sure Denise
was buried with dignity.

1433
01:01:46,202 --> 01:01:48,036
     It was the very least
          I could do.

1434
01:01:49,789 --> 01:01:51,490
       <i>( music playing )</i>

1435
01:01:51,541 --> 01:01:55,243
         <i>¶ She's faced</i>
      <i>the hardest times ¶</i>

1436
01:01:55,277 --> 01:01:58,446
     <i>¶ You could imagine </i>

1437
01:01:58,464 --> 01:02:00,248
       <i>¶ And many times </i>

1438
01:02:00,282 --> 01:02:04,302
     <i>¶ Her eyes fought back</i>
          <i>the tears ¶</i>

1439
01:02:04,337 --> 01:02:07,389
         <i>¶ Lord, Lord </i>

1440
01:02:07,423 --> 01:02:09,808
         <i>¶ And when her</i>
     <i>youthful world ¶</i>

1441
01:02:09,842 --> 01:02:13,311
 <i>¶ Was about to fall in </i>

1442
01:02:13,346 --> 01:02:17,766
          <i>¶ Each time</i>
 <i>her slender shoulders ¶</i>

1443
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:21,436
       <i>¶ Bore the weight</i>
       <i>of all her fears ¶</i>

1444
01:02:21,470 --> 01:02:25,440
         <i>¶ And a sorrow</i>
         <i>no one hears ¶</i>

1445
01:02:25,474 --> 01:02:29,277
         <i>¶ Still rings</i>
     <i>in midnight silence ¶</i>

1446
01:02:29,311 --> 01:02:33,248
     <i>¶ In her ears </i>

1447
01:02:33,282 --> 01:02:36,668
     <i>¶ Let her cry </i>

1448
01:02:36,702 --> 01:02:41,339
      <i>¶ For she's a lady </i>

1449
01:02:41,374 --> 01:02:45,460
       <i>¶ Let her dream </i>

1450
01:02:45,494 --> 01:02:48,663
     <i>¶ For she is a child </i>

1451
01:02:48,681 --> 01:02:52,000
         <i>¶ Let the rain</i>
 <i>fall down upon her... ¶</i>

1452
01:02:52,018 --> 01:02:53,685
        Mm-mm-mm.

1453
01:02:53,719 --> 01:02:57,689
        Mm-mm-mm
        mm mm mm-mm mm.

1454
01:02:57,723 --> 01:03:01,309
        Mm-mm-mm.
      I should have known
it was gonna be trouble.

1455
01:03:01,343 --> 01:03:03,895
         One ballroom
represented by 50 states

1456
01:03:03,946 --> 01:03:06,948
of beautiful black women.

1457
01:03:06,983 --> 01:03:08,650
    And I was really bored.

1458
01:03:08,684 --> 01:03:11,987
         So when I was
     invited as a guest to
    the Indiana Black Expo,

1459
01:03:12,021 --> 01:03:14,122
        I jumped
      at the opportunity.

1460
01:03:14,157 --> 01:03:16,524
      I had no idea this
one decision, once again,

1461
01:03:16,542 --> 01:03:19,161
      changed the course
          of my life.

1462
01:03:19,195 --> 01:03:22,530
Now, there was a lot of things
  I could have gone to prison
    for at this time,

1463
01:03:22,548 --> 01:03:24,749
        but this wasn't
         one of them.

1464
01:03:24,801 --> 01:03:27,335
     Although I understood
 the seriousness of the case,

1465
01:03:27,369 --> 01:03:29,370
    I really believed
  that justice would prevail

1466
01:03:29,388 --> 01:03:31,756
     and that the evidence
      would exonerate me.

1467
01:03:31,808 --> 01:03:35,877
However, I was convicted
before the trial even started.

1468
01:03:35,895 --> 01:03:37,712
    I really wanna go back
and read the transcripts

1469
01:03:37,730 --> 01:03:40,148
  about my case and find out
     what really happened.

1470
01:03:40,183 --> 01:03:42,684
'Cause I don't understand
  how I was facing 63 years--

1471
01:03:42,718 --> 01:03:46,488
    check this out--
and only did three years
     of a 10-year sentence

1472
01:03:46,522 --> 01:03:48,723
 that Judge Patricia Gifford,
known as the "hanging judge"--

1473
01:03:48,741 --> 01:03:50,525
        who I had
    as a judge, of course--

1474
01:03:50,559 --> 01:03:52,410
      dropped four years
    off my sentence.

1475
01:03:52,445 --> 01:03:54,746
  Now what black man you know
     got convicted of rape

1476
01:03:54,780 --> 01:03:57,699
    in the state of Indiana
and only got three years,
             okay?

1477
01:03:57,733 --> 01:03:59,668
     It wasn't like I had
      a hell of a lawyer.

1478
01:03:59,702 --> 01:04:01,069
     I could've did better
        with Joe Pesci

1479
01:04:01,087 --> 01:04:04,422
 in "My Fucking Cousin Vinny,"
             okay?

1480
01:04:04,457 --> 01:04:06,091
     My brother Don King--

1481
01:04:06,125 --> 01:04:07,742
      ( mimics Don King )
    "Nyuk, nyuk, nyuk, only
  in America, motherfucker."

1482
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:10,795
        Fuck you.
He hired Vincent Fuller,

1483
01:04:10,847 --> 01:04:13,215
        a tax attorney,
        for my defense.

1484
01:04:13,249 --> 01:04:14,466
        No, you're not
    listening to me.

1485
01:04:14,517 --> 01:04:17,602
    Balcony, a tax--
    a goddamn tax attorney.

1486
01:04:17,637 --> 01:04:20,522
  I didn't have tax problems
back then, I need his ass <i>now.</i>

1487
01:04:20,556 --> 01:04:22,774
           <i>You know,</i>
     <i>and I was just saying,</i>

1488
01:04:22,808 --> 01:04:24,609
      I'm tired of living
      as a sex offender.

1489
01:04:24,644 --> 01:04:27,062
      I have to register
        wherever I go.

1490
01:04:27,096 --> 01:04:29,731
     My kids are at an age
where they ask questions

1491
01:04:29,765 --> 01:04:32,033
      and I want to have
better answers for them.

1492
01:04:32,068 --> 01:04:34,569
     Well, really, I need
  better answers for myself.

1493
01:04:34,603 --> 01:04:37,605
      And I also want to
     make this point that
    wasn't argued in court

1494
01:04:37,623 --> 01:04:39,107
        that could have
        exonerated me.

1495
01:04:39,125 --> 01:04:41,576
          Now I know
    rape's a serious thing,

1496
01:04:41,610 --> 01:04:44,880
and I know things happen
        in life,

1497
01:04:44,914 --> 01:04:46,948
but this wasn't the first time
      Desiree Washington

1498
01:04:46,966 --> 01:04:48,633
         claimed that
      somebody raped her.

1499
01:04:48,668 --> 01:04:51,670
  There was another incident
     right before my case.

1500
01:04:51,721 --> 01:04:54,089
And I don't know the odds
    of this happening twice

1501
01:04:54,123 --> 01:04:56,391
      to the same person
  in a short period of time.

1502
01:04:56,425 --> 01:04:58,793
        I did not rape
      Desiree Washington

1503
01:04:58,811 --> 01:05:00,478
        and that's all
I have to say about this.

1504
01:05:00,513 --> 01:05:02,931
         ( applause )

1505
01:05:07,103 --> 01:05:09,738
      So I went to prison
  for something I didn't do,

1506
01:05:09,772 --> 01:05:11,573
    but it turned out
    to be a blessing.

1507
01:05:11,607 --> 01:05:15,327
     It was the first time
     in my life I was able
          to be still

1508
01:05:15,361 --> 01:05:17,245
    and there was a freedom
     that came with that.

1509
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:19,531
         Now hold up,
     I'm not recommending

1510
01:05:19,582 --> 01:05:21,116
    anybody go into prison

1511
01:05:21,150 --> 01:05:23,752
  to get any kind of freedom
      or anything, okay?

1512
01:05:23,786 --> 01:05:25,954
Just go in the bathroom,
    do what you have to do,

1513
01:05:25,988 --> 01:05:27,923
and just call it a wrap.

1514
01:05:27,957 --> 01:05:30,041
     I didn't go in there
    singing "Kumbaya"

1515
01:05:30,092 --> 01:05:32,043
and "Don't Fucking Worry,
    Be Happy," right?

1516
01:05:32,094 --> 01:05:33,762
  I was pissed the fuck off.

1517
01:05:33,796 --> 01:05:35,513
        And, you know,
     I'm from Brownsville,
        Brooklyn,

1518
01:05:35,548 --> 01:05:37,849
      and I couldn't wait
to get in there and prove
     to those psychopaths

1519
01:05:37,883 --> 01:05:40,185
    I was just as homicidal
as they were if not more.

1520
01:05:40,219 --> 01:05:43,772
    Right? So as soon
     as I got in my cell,
          you know--

1521
01:05:43,806 --> 01:05:45,340
     of course, you know,
  they give you your stuff--

1522
01:05:45,358 --> 01:05:46,691
         you know what
     they give you, right?

1523
01:05:46,726 --> 01:05:49,344
         Your sheets--
 you know what they give you.

1524
01:05:50,980 --> 01:05:52,680
          <i>The sheets--</i>
           <i>you know--</i>

1525
01:05:54,317 --> 01:05:55,817
     I'm going to my cell,

1526
01:05:55,851 --> 01:05:58,853
 I packed my stuff in my cell,
     and I come back out.

1527
01:05:58,871 --> 01:06:01,873
        "Dig, man, Rod,
    don't go near my
     motherfucking house."

1528
01:06:01,907 --> 01:06:03,375
     That's my jail voice.

1529
01:06:03,409 --> 01:06:05,493
        "Don't go near
 my motherfucking house, Rod.

1530
01:06:05,527 --> 01:06:07,295
        Dig, Rod,
  don't go near that mother--

1531
01:06:07,330 --> 01:06:09,381
    I need a phone, nigga.
    I don't know which one,
    but I need one."

1532
01:06:09,415 --> 01:06:11,549
        "No, fuck you!"
 "No, fuck you, motherfucker!

1533
01:06:11,584 --> 01:06:15,203
      And fuck you, too,
you nappyhead-Aryan-Nazi
        motherfucker!"

1534
01:06:15,221 --> 01:06:17,973
     And then, of course,

1535
01:06:18,007 --> 01:06:21,226
  there's always some really
 humble, black, Muslim brother

1536
01:06:21,260 --> 01:06:22,894
with a thick Arab accent

1537
01:06:22,928 --> 01:06:25,046
      that never even met
 an Arab motherfucker, right?

1538
01:06:25,064 --> 01:06:27,599
        But he comes--
  he comes to me and he goes,

1539
01:06:27,650 --> 01:06:29,351
      <i>"Assalamu alaikum,</i>
        Brother Mike."

1540
01:06:29,385 --> 01:06:32,354
      ( speaking Arabic )

1541
01:06:32,388 --> 01:06:34,522
  "Brother Mike, we're here--

1542
01:06:34,556 --> 01:06:36,274
         Brother Mike,

1543
01:06:36,325 --> 01:06:39,160
      under the umbrella
     of Allah doing time,

1544
01:06:39,195 --> 01:06:42,998
 not allowing time to do us."
( speaking mock Arabic )

1545
01:06:43,032 --> 01:06:44,532
         And so I say,
"Fuck you, motherfucker!

1546
01:06:44,566 --> 01:06:47,002
         Get the fuck
        out of here! "

1547
01:06:47,036 --> 01:06:49,337
     But then, eventually
 of course, you're in prison.
        You chill out.

1548
01:06:49,372 --> 01:06:52,407
     Some people are nice.
  They got good personalities
 and maybe it's not that bad.

1549
01:06:52,425 --> 01:06:55,460
    When I was in prison--
    you guys didn't know--
  I had a visitor every day.

1550
01:06:55,511 --> 01:06:58,763
    My most famous visitor
     was my man Spike Lee.
     He came to visit us.

1551
01:06:58,798 --> 01:07:01,466
    He did a preview

1552
01:07:01,517 --> 01:07:04,352
        of "Malcolm X"
 before it went to the movies.

1553
01:07:04,387 --> 01:07:07,222
    It was pretty awesome,
  but there was actually only
    like nine black people

1554
01:07:07,256 --> 01:07:09,924
    in Indiana prison
 and like 42,000 white people.

1555
01:07:09,942 --> 01:07:12,310
    It was all Nazis
      and Aryans and shit

1556
01:07:12,361 --> 01:07:15,113
    and Spike almost
        got us killed.

1557
01:07:16,932 --> 01:07:19,818
Shit. Oh, Whitney Houston
    came to visit me.

1558
01:07:19,869 --> 01:07:24,039
         Tupac Shakur,
    James Brown, of course,
      John Kennedy, Jr.,

1559
01:07:24,073 --> 01:07:27,625
      and matter of fact,
they're not here no more,
so may they all rest in peace.

1560
01:07:28,944 --> 01:07:30,128
      Wow, that's a trip.

1561
01:07:30,162 --> 01:07:32,580
         Maya Angelou
    came to visit me.

1562
01:07:32,614 --> 01:07:35,967
          LL Cool J,
    Reverend Al Sharpton--

1563
01:07:36,001 --> 01:07:38,219
         the fat guy,
      not the small guy.

1564
01:07:38,254 --> 01:07:41,139
         Okay, so, um,
Larry King came up there.

1565
01:07:41,173 --> 01:07:43,124
        The O'Jays came
    to visit me, too.

1566
01:07:43,142 --> 01:07:45,626
    Not O.J. Simpson,
know your R&B, the band.

1567
01:07:45,644 --> 01:07:47,679
    ¶ Backstabbers.

1568
01:07:50,299 --> 01:07:53,068
    Even Florence Henderson
    from "The Brady Bunch."

1569
01:07:58,474 --> 01:08:00,275
        She was in town
for the Indianapolis 500,

1570
01:08:00,309 --> 01:08:04,112
  which is the big-- she was
 singing "God Bless America,"

1571
01:08:04,146 --> 01:08:06,781
     yeah, sitting next to
  the mayor and the governor,

1572
01:08:06,815 --> 01:08:09,250
    and she said, "I'd like
    to go see Mike Tyson."

1573
01:08:09,285 --> 01:08:11,453
      And the mayor said,
      "Then you should."

1574
01:08:11,487 --> 01:08:13,171
         At that day,
    I'm in the hole.

1575
01:08:13,205 --> 01:08:14,989
I spent a lot of my time
in the hole when I'm locked up.

1576
01:08:15,007 --> 01:08:17,459
 The guard comes and he says,
"Oh, God, hey, Mr. Tyson, sir."

1577
01:08:17,493 --> 01:08:19,878
 Real good guy, Christian guy.
"Mr. Tyson, sir, oh, sir,

1578
01:08:19,929 --> 01:08:22,464
  you don't know who's here.
        Ooh, they came.

1579
01:08:22,498 --> 01:08:24,883
     You'll never believe
who's here to see you now, sir."

1580
01:08:24,934 --> 01:08:26,518
    I'm saying, like,
    "Who, Michael Jackson?"

1581
01:08:26,552 --> 01:08:29,104
    He said, "No, not him.
         Even better."

1582
01:08:29,138 --> 01:08:31,556
        He said,
"Miss Florence Henderson
from 'The Brady Bunch.'"

1583
01:08:31,607 --> 01:08:34,192
     I said, "Get the fuck
      outta here," right?

1584
01:08:34,226 --> 01:08:37,562
And then he got insulted

1585
01:08:37,613 --> 01:08:39,447
         and he said,
  "Excuse me, Mr. Tyson, sir,

1586
01:08:39,482 --> 01:08:42,233
    I've always treated you
    like a man, sir, since
    you've been here.

1587
01:08:42,284 --> 01:08:44,319
 I've never disrespected you,
and, sir, and I'm a man,

1588
01:08:44,353 --> 01:08:45,870
     and I'm not gonna lie
 because I'm a Christian, sir.

1589
01:08:45,905 --> 01:08:47,355
          Yes, I am.
    I'm a Christian.

1590
01:08:47,373 --> 01:08:48,957
     Yeah, I know, I know.

1591
01:08:48,991 --> 01:08:50,909
    I know everybody
say they're a Christian.
Everybody's a Christian,

1592
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:53,044
     but they ain't saved.
          I'm saved."

1593
01:08:53,078 --> 01:08:54,996
          And I said,
         "Okay, cool."

1594
01:08:55,030 --> 01:08:57,499
     As I go on up, I say,
      "Cool, I'm gonna go

1595
01:08:57,533 --> 01:08:59,634
     meet Miss Henderson,
      beautiful person."

1596
01:08:59,668 --> 01:09:01,836
 And then, of course, there's
always the asshole going,

1597
01:09:01,870 --> 01:09:03,204
    "Where you going, boy?

1598
01:09:03,222 --> 01:09:05,507
    Heh-heh-heh-heh.
        Huh, 'Champ'?"

1599
01:09:05,541 --> 01:09:07,809
"Well, I'm going to see--
Miss Henderson's outside.

1600
01:09:07,843 --> 01:09:10,595
     She came to visit me
and I'd like to visit with her."

1601
01:09:10,646 --> 01:09:13,181
     "Not without these."
  He's holding the shackles.

1602
01:09:13,215 --> 01:09:14,882
        And for people
 who don't know the shackles,

1603
01:09:14,900 --> 01:09:17,051
it's like the Kunta Kinte thing,
    young man, okay?

1604
01:09:17,069 --> 01:09:20,271
      You're right here,
and many times I've been
         in the hole,

1605
01:09:20,322 --> 01:09:23,191
 as I was explaining earlier,
    and sometimes my lawyer
    came to visit me,

1606
01:09:23,225 --> 01:09:25,777
and if you're in the hole
  and you come and you visit
         your lawyer,

1607
01:09:25,828 --> 01:09:28,446
it's-- and you're shackled up,
you can't shake his hand.

1608
01:09:28,497 --> 01:09:30,398
        You gotta shake
      his hand like this.

1609
01:09:30,416 --> 01:09:33,585
    And I'm not gonna
 shake Miss Henderson's hand,
    "How you doing, ma'am?"

1610
01:09:33,619 --> 01:09:37,338
  "Hi, Miss Henderson, ma'am.
      Well, I got caught.

1611
01:09:37,373 --> 01:09:40,792
     I gots caught tryin'
  to run for freedom, ma'am.

1612
01:09:40,843 --> 01:09:43,378
    Hey, ma'am, do you know
    Mayor Goldsmith?

1613
01:09:43,412 --> 01:09:45,296
Can you get me some help?
      I need liberation.

1614
01:09:45,347 --> 01:09:49,417
    I need isolation.
     I need some freedom."

1615
01:09:49,435 --> 01:09:51,102
  But I just couldn't do it.

1616
01:09:51,136 --> 01:09:54,055
I just decided I'd rather
    not let Miss Henderson
    see me like this.

1617
01:09:54,089 --> 01:09:58,259
      But I was grateful
    for her visit, and all
         my visitors.

1618
01:09:58,277 --> 01:10:00,645
These people gave me hope
     in a hopeless place.

1619
01:10:00,696 --> 01:10:04,115
  They knew I wasn't the guy
      the DAs wanted them
    to believe I was.

1620
01:10:04,149 --> 01:10:08,036
    Never did I think
 I'd go to prison with all my
     fucking mental issues

1621
01:10:08,070 --> 01:10:10,154
         and come out
        finding peace.

1622
01:10:10,206 --> 01:10:13,374
         Temporarily,
    but some kind of peace.

1623
01:10:13,409 --> 01:10:15,326
    And one of those major
        stepping-stones

1624
01:10:15,377 --> 01:10:17,445
      was when I learned
         about Islam.

1625
01:10:18,714 --> 01:10:20,281
    You know, before this,
I wasn't very religious.

1626
01:10:20,299 --> 01:10:23,301
          Pretty much
        a Neanderthal.

1627
01:10:23,335 --> 01:10:25,620
There were a few Muslims,
          just a few,

1628
01:10:25,638 --> 01:10:28,389
  and I noticed some of them
  possessed a calm demeanor,

1629
01:10:28,424 --> 01:10:30,508
        something that
      I'd never mastered,

1630
01:10:30,559 --> 01:10:32,393
     and it intrigued me.

1631
01:10:32,428 --> 01:10:35,480
    And I wanted and needed
     something to enforce
     some kind of feeling

1632
01:10:35,514 --> 01:10:37,849
and structure in my life,
    at the time, of course,

1633
01:10:37,900 --> 01:10:39,817
and for me it was Islam.

1634
01:10:39,852 --> 01:10:42,570
So I began reading the Qur'an,
    attending class,

1635
01:10:42,605 --> 01:10:44,138
    and it's just who I am.

1636
01:10:44,156 --> 01:10:46,157
And after I left prison,
    I have to admit,

1637
01:10:46,191 --> 01:10:48,243
      I was really scared
          'cause I...

1638
01:10:48,277 --> 01:10:49,827
 <i>( cash register dings )</i>

1639
01:10:49,862 --> 01:10:52,447
       <i>I had $400 million</i>
 <i>in my bank account coming to me</i>

1640
01:10:52,481 --> 01:10:55,983
        and not a clue
  how I was going to survive
for the next 400 seconds.

1641
01:10:56,001 --> 01:10:59,287
 And I wanted to stay focused
on my deen and practice Islam,

1642
01:10:59,321 --> 01:11:02,490
but my quest for righteousness
        quickly halted

1643
01:11:02,508 --> 01:11:04,292
          once those
      prison cells opened

1644
01:11:04,326 --> 01:11:06,994
      and all the snakes,
      leeches, and trolls
    started sucking on me.

1645
01:11:07,012 --> 01:11:09,631
 And I loved snakes, leeches,
and trolls because back then--

1646
01:11:09,665 --> 01:11:11,015
     because they make you
      feel great, right?

1647
01:11:11,050 --> 01:11:15,186
So, on top of the list of those
     parasites was my man,

1648
01:11:15,220 --> 01:11:18,940
      ( mimics Don King )
"Nyuk, nyuk, nyuk, nyuk.
  Only in America" Don King.

1649
01:11:18,974 --> 01:11:20,141
        Fuck you.

1650
01:11:20,175 --> 01:11:22,477
    So, the real beef
      between me and Don

1651
01:11:22,511 --> 01:11:25,863
    was fueled after I lost
      my boxing license.

1652
01:11:25,898 --> 01:11:28,182
    And Mr. Vince McMahon,
    he approached me

1653
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:30,401
  and he wanted me to become
    a part of WrestleMania.

1654
01:11:30,452 --> 01:11:32,370
    So Vince McMahon goes,
"Mike, come with us, man.

1655
01:11:32,404 --> 01:11:34,155
    You're gonna be bigger
         than boxing.

1656
01:11:34,189 --> 01:11:35,907
You're gonna get in wrestling.
    You're gonna be in our
          family now.

1657
01:11:35,958 --> 01:11:38,743
    Wrestling's fake,
but the checks are real."

1658
01:11:38,794 --> 01:11:41,079
     <i>And I'm like, "Cool."</i>

1659
01:11:41,130 --> 01:11:43,698
      And so they needed
clearance for some photos

1660
01:11:43,716 --> 01:11:45,199
    and Don was giving them
         a hard time,

1661
01:11:45,217 --> 01:11:48,052
trying to charge them $300,000
      for <i>pictures</i> of me.

1662
01:11:48,087 --> 01:11:50,004
I started questioning my rights.
We did an investigation.

1663
01:11:50,038 --> 01:11:52,140
    We found that Don
    owned my rights.

1664
01:11:52,174 --> 01:11:55,176
  And I really suppose it was
  easy to rob me at the time

1665
01:11:55,210 --> 01:11:58,479
     'cause Don so kindly
 recommended <i>his</i> best lawyers

1666
01:11:58,514 --> 01:12:03,401
and <i>his</i> best accountants
that <i>my</i> money could buy.

1667
01:12:03,435 --> 01:12:05,653
        So I made this
multimillion-dollar deal

1668
01:12:05,688 --> 01:12:08,389
     with this big network
and Don was fucking both of us.

1669
01:12:08,407 --> 01:12:10,825
     He would demand money
 from them saying it's for me,

1670
01:12:10,859 --> 01:12:12,777
  and if they didn't give it
to me, "Mike would leave.

1671
01:12:12,828 --> 01:12:14,746
     He's a crazy nigga."

1672
01:12:14,780 --> 01:12:18,950
And I would never get the money,
 but he would bill me for it.

1673
01:12:19,001 --> 01:12:21,619
So once we started doing
     this investigation--

1674
01:12:21,670 --> 01:12:25,289
oh, this is another word
 we worked on with the-- with
    the-- with the voice--

1675
01:12:25,341 --> 01:12:26,758
        vocal chords--
      the speech coach--

1676
01:12:26,792 --> 01:12:30,077
when we did that investigating
and this "auditing shit," right?

1677
01:12:30,095 --> 01:12:32,096
  The "auditing shit," right?

1678
01:12:32,131 --> 01:12:35,433
     One of the line items
         billed to Don

1679
01:12:35,467 --> 01:12:39,086
    was he charged me
    $8,000 a week...

1680
01:12:39,104 --> 01:12:41,189
          for towels.

1681
01:12:41,223 --> 01:12:44,192
  I ain't fucking with y'all.
      Balcony, balcony--

1682
01:12:44,226 --> 01:12:47,111
     8,000 fucking dollars
      a week for towels.

1683
01:12:47,146 --> 01:12:48,529
     I wasn't getting high
    on cocaine then.

1684
01:12:48,564 --> 01:12:50,615
    I wasn't sweating
      like a pimp on a ho
          back then.

1685
01:12:50,649 --> 01:12:52,233
    Hell fucking no.

1686
01:12:52,267 --> 01:12:55,102
Just imagine all the other stuff
    he was billing me for.

1687
01:12:55,120 --> 01:12:57,321
    So, we finally settled,

1688
01:12:57,373 --> 01:13:00,041
and I won, but the damage
    was already done.

1689
01:13:00,075 --> 01:13:01,826
         I was forced
      to file bankruptcy,

1690
01:13:01,877 --> 01:13:03,327
    and of course you know,

1691
01:13:03,379 --> 01:13:06,947
     once the money goes,
    so does the hos.

1692
01:13:06,965 --> 01:13:11,452
        I was homeless
         and ho-less.

1693
01:13:11,470 --> 01:13:13,588
    I've been trying
     to work at this thing
    from a forgiving place,

1694
01:13:13,622 --> 01:13:16,290
    but it's fucking hard,
        you know?

1695
01:13:16,308 --> 01:13:19,126
 Oh, speaking of forgiveness,
I'm really very grateful

1696
01:13:19,144 --> 01:13:21,979
         that Evander
     forgave me for this.

1697
01:13:22,014 --> 01:13:24,482
        Oh, I know that
     fucking hurt so much.

1698
01:13:24,516 --> 01:13:26,967
        What was
    I thinking about, man?

1699
01:13:26,985 --> 01:13:29,437
  He lost a piece of his ear,
I lost a piece of money--

1700
01:13:29,471 --> 01:13:31,806
        a lot of money,
    and I lost my license.

1701
01:13:31,824 --> 01:13:34,909
    And all I can say
      is that I snapped.

1702
01:13:34,943 --> 01:13:37,111
    And the days following
        were pure hell.

1703
01:13:37,145 --> 01:13:39,197
I went from the 10th hated man
        on the planet,

1704
01:13:39,248 --> 01:13:40,948
     which I could handle,

1705
01:13:40,982 --> 01:13:44,035
    but to numero uno
 after I bit the motherfucker,
            right?

1706
01:13:44,086 --> 01:13:47,004
         So, you know,
that was some hard shit.

1707
01:13:47,039 --> 01:13:51,492
     I mean, I was angry.
 I was just really pissed off.

1708
01:13:51,510 --> 01:13:54,345
Then I was forced to read
 this contrived apology letter

1709
01:13:54,379 --> 01:13:57,849
    at the press conference
     for the Nevada State
     Athletic Commission.

1710
01:13:57,883 --> 01:14:00,601
  And to make matters worse,
    I had to read it
    on my birthday--

1711
01:14:00,636 --> 01:14:04,672
        June 3rd, 1997.
Happy birthday, dickhead.

1712
01:14:04,690 --> 01:14:06,006
But now I really am sorry

1713
01:14:06,024 --> 01:14:07,942
     and me and Holyfield
     have become friends.

1714
01:14:07,976 --> 01:14:09,227
    And look at him.

1715
01:14:09,278 --> 01:14:12,647
      He's real debonair.

1716
01:14:12,681 --> 01:14:14,148
          <i>See, right?</i>

1717
01:14:14,182 --> 01:14:17,452
     <i>Real class act.</i>
           <i>Debonair.</i>

1718
01:14:17,486 --> 01:14:20,988
      And me, I look like
         I could be...

1719
01:14:21,022 --> 01:14:23,023
          Holyfield's
  fat grandmother, you know?

1720
01:14:23,041 --> 01:14:27,495
          You take--
  throw a wig, a dress on me,
     and I'm Madea, right?

1721
01:14:27,529 --> 01:14:29,029
      But irregardless...

1722
01:14:29,047 --> 01:14:32,550
That's that cocaine, man.

1723
01:14:32,584 --> 01:14:36,036
     But, no, Holyfield's
  just a beautiful guy, man.
    A beautiful man.

1724
01:14:36,054 --> 01:14:37,638
        And I just want
    the best for him.

1725
01:14:37,673 --> 01:14:41,058
      Guys, please go buy
his barbecue sauce, okay?

1726
01:14:46,715 --> 01:14:49,183
 <i>I really like to address</i>
     <i>everything I just said</i>

1727
01:14:49,217 --> 01:14:52,219
        and consider it
     about my life as PT--

1728
01:14:52,237 --> 01:14:53,654
          pre-tattoo.

1729
01:14:53,689 --> 01:14:55,740
    Everyone wants to know,
    "What the fuck are you
          doing, man?

1730
01:14:55,774 --> 01:14:57,241
    What you put that
    on your face for?

1731
01:14:57,276 --> 01:14:59,059
  What, are you crazy, nigga?
You being like those white boys.

1732
01:14:59,077 --> 01:15:00,995
Why the fuck you do that?
  What does that mean, Mike?"

1733
01:15:01,029 --> 01:15:02,363
     You get the gay guys
        come up to me,

1734
01:15:02,397 --> 01:15:04,081
      "Man, you're very--
         you're very--

1735
01:15:04,116 --> 01:15:07,618
    ooh, you're very-- ooh.

1736
01:15:07,669 --> 01:15:11,422
 You're a very exotic-looking
    man, Mr. Tyson."

1737
01:15:11,456 --> 01:15:13,624
I just wanted everybody to know,
    I put this tramp stamp

1738
01:15:13,675 --> 01:15:16,043
          on my face
     because I wanted to.

1739
01:15:16,077 --> 01:15:18,796
        Leave me alone.
      You don't like it,
don't fucking look at it.

1740
01:15:18,847 --> 01:15:22,517
        Fuck you, okay?
         It's my face.

1741
01:15:22,551 --> 01:15:25,636
           <i>God damn.</i>
   <i>Just don't worry about it.</i>

1742
01:15:25,687 --> 01:15:27,755
    After the tattoo,
      it could be argued

1743
01:15:27,773 --> 01:15:30,107
          that I went
    even crazier, you know?

1744
01:15:30,142 --> 01:15:33,778
 I retired from boxing, and...

1745
01:15:33,812 --> 01:15:36,981
I started using cocaine.
I had nothing to hold me back,

1746
01:15:37,032 --> 01:15:39,283
    and for a dude like me,
that's pretty dangerous.

1747
01:15:39,318 --> 01:15:41,652
      My low self-esteem
     takes over the wheel,

1748
01:15:41,703 --> 01:15:43,988
 fueled by my megalomania ego

1749
01:15:44,039 --> 01:15:46,440
 and, man, that's an explosion
    ready to happen.

1750
01:15:46,458 --> 01:15:48,292
        A lot of people
 were asking me all the time,

1751
01:15:48,327 --> 01:15:49,744
  "What was your rock bottom?

1752
01:15:49,778 --> 01:15:51,913
     When did you know you
  had a problem with cocaine,
            Mike?"

1753
01:15:51,947 --> 01:15:53,548
    As Oprah Winfrey
          would say,

1754
01:15:53,582 --> 01:15:55,550
        "What was
your 'aha moment,' Mike?"

1755
01:15:55,584 --> 01:15:58,219
          ¶ When was
    your aha, aha? ¶

1756
01:15:58,253 --> 01:16:00,588
    I knew things were bad
  when I got arrested in 2006

1757
01:16:00,622 --> 01:16:02,640
      before I almost hit
          a cop car.

1758
01:16:02,674 --> 01:16:05,476
    I mean, who does that?
  So, the officer says to me,

1759
01:16:05,510 --> 01:16:07,812
"Well, Mike, man, we knew
      you had a problem,

1760
01:16:07,846 --> 01:16:10,431
      but we were hoping
  if you made that left turn,
    you'd have kept going,

1761
01:16:10,465 --> 01:16:13,184
         but you kept
     straight at us, man.
    You just kept coming."

1762
01:16:13,235 --> 01:16:16,237
         And I'm like,
          "Oh, God."

1763
01:16:16,271 --> 01:16:18,239
    But he's like, "We know
    you've got a problem."

1764
01:16:18,273 --> 01:16:21,275
So I'm in a holding cell
right now in Phoenix, Arizona.

1765
01:16:21,309 --> 01:16:23,110
    I'm in a holding cell.

1766
01:16:23,144 --> 01:16:27,147
    And, no offense,
but there's always some smart,
      creepy white guy--

1767
01:16:27,165 --> 01:16:29,000
          small guy--
    that knows the system.

1768
01:16:29,034 --> 01:16:30,418
    Even though he's always
        in the system,

1769
01:16:30,452 --> 01:16:32,954
      he knows the system
      better than anybody
        in the system.

1770
01:16:32,988 --> 01:16:34,839
        So he asks me,
    he goes this way,

1771
01:16:34,873 --> 01:16:37,541
  he says, "Mike, hey, Champ.
     What are you in for?"

1772
01:16:37,593 --> 01:16:39,326
      And I'm depressed,
    I'm really down.

1773
01:16:39,344 --> 01:16:41,762
         The cocaine's
wearing off and I'm just
     really getting down.

1774
01:16:41,797 --> 01:16:44,548
          And I say,
  "It's blow, man. Cocaine."

1775
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:47,602
         And he says,
      "Have you ever been
  arrested for drugs before?"

1776
01:16:47,636 --> 01:16:50,504
      I go, "Yeah, yeah,
I got a couple felonies.
Yeah, I already got a felony."

1777
01:16:50,522 --> 01:16:52,974
  He said, "No, but have you
ever been arrested for drugs?"

1778
01:16:53,008 --> 01:16:54,725
    I said, "No, no.
      Never before, no."

1779
01:16:54,776 --> 01:16:56,861
  He said, "Well, they can't
         put you away.

1780
01:16:56,895 --> 01:16:58,946
          They can't
      lock you up, Champ.

1781
01:16:58,981 --> 01:17:00,781
        Naw, they gotta
        help you first.

1782
01:17:00,816 --> 01:17:05,236
    According to law 4902,
     'Take a puff or two,'

1783
01:17:05,287 --> 01:17:07,021
      they gotta help you
 before they throw you away--

1784
01:17:07,039 --> 01:17:08,906
before they lock you up,
          some shit."

1785
01:17:08,957 --> 01:17:12,159
So I went from being down
  to being very up, you know?

1786
01:17:12,193 --> 01:17:14,829
     So I'm talking shit,
        and I'm--

1787
01:17:14,863 --> 01:17:18,082
     and so the intake guy
     comes in and he says,

1788
01:17:18,133 --> 01:17:20,001
      "Aw, Champ, this is
 really a bad day in my life.

1789
01:17:20,035 --> 01:17:22,503
     You're a hero of mine
  and I'm really feeling bad,
     but all right, Champ,

1790
01:17:22,537 --> 01:17:25,873
     let's go through it.
     Now, Champ, how often
  do you use cocaine, Champ?"

1791
01:17:25,891 --> 01:17:27,508
      I said, "Every time
      I get a chance to.

1792
01:17:27,542 --> 01:17:31,045
  Any time I get-- you know?
     When I get a chance.

1793
01:17:31,063 --> 01:17:32,430
    Whenever I get--
any time I get a chance.

1794
01:17:32,481 --> 01:17:34,265
 I'm like, I need cocaine now.
    I wish I had some now."

1795
01:17:34,316 --> 01:17:36,350
         I was just--
    I needed cocaine.

1796
01:17:36,384 --> 01:17:39,553
  Um, I didn't want no help,
      I just didn't want
        to go to jail.

1797
01:17:39,571 --> 01:17:42,556
I was facing nine years.
    Oh, I can't-- oh, fuck.

1798
01:17:42,574 --> 01:17:46,226
So, following that 2006 arrest,
    I went to rehab,

1799
01:17:46,244 --> 01:17:49,780
the best forced decision
    I ever made, all right?

1800
01:17:49,831 --> 01:17:51,332
       <i>I just got tired.</i>

1801
01:17:51,366 --> 01:17:53,167
          I got tired
    of disappointing
          my family.

1802
01:17:53,201 --> 01:17:54,752
    My family wouldn't even
          talk to me.

1803
01:17:54,786 --> 01:17:57,588
You know, when you're on drugs,
 nobody talks to you no more.

1804
01:17:57,622 --> 01:17:59,540
You could cheat on your family,
cheat on your girlfriend,

1805
01:17:59,574 --> 01:18:01,759
    but once you do drugs,
they don't talk to you no more.

1806
01:18:01,793 --> 01:18:05,880
    And so eventually
I married my girlfriend,
         Kiki Spicer,

1807
01:18:05,914 --> 01:18:07,748
        in 2009.

1808
01:18:09,918 --> 01:18:11,802
And she was looking out for me
     and taking care of me

1809
01:18:11,853 --> 01:18:14,055
          through all
    my relapses and stuff.

1810
01:18:14,089 --> 01:18:16,440
    It's my third marriage
        and her first.

1811
01:18:16,475 --> 01:18:18,425
        Hopefully
     both our last, right?

1812
01:18:18,443 --> 01:18:21,362
      But anyway, we have
two beautiful children--

1813
01:18:21,396 --> 01:18:23,364
     beautiful, beautiful,
beautiful-- Milan and Morocco.

1814
01:18:23,398 --> 01:18:25,616
 And when I first got married,
when we first hooked up,

1815
01:18:25,650 --> 01:18:28,235
     I was morbidly obese.
I was 380 pounds, right?

1816
01:18:28,269 --> 01:18:31,455
  - Oh, wow.
  - And there's nothing worse
    than a fat cokehead.

1817
01:18:31,490 --> 01:18:33,624
You ain't think a motherfucker
     on coke gonna be fat.

1818
01:18:33,658 --> 01:18:35,409
    You don't think nobody
    on coke's gonna be fat,

1819
01:18:35,443 --> 01:18:38,579
but, you know, I became a vegan.
     I started exercising.

1820
01:18:38,613 --> 01:18:42,500
          And I lost
    over 160 pounds.

1821
01:18:42,551 --> 01:18:44,618
        - <i>( applause )</i>
        - Yeah.

1822
01:18:44,636 --> 01:18:47,588
 And, listen, I suddenly went
 from wanting to die every day

1823
01:18:47,622 --> 01:18:49,340
      to all of a sudden
    wanting to live.

1824
01:18:49,391 --> 01:18:51,458
      Now I'm four years
    clean and sober,

1825
01:18:51,476 --> 01:18:54,428
         a better man,
    striving to be a
        better father.

1826
01:18:55,814 --> 01:18:58,632
         ( applause )

1827
01:18:58,650 --> 01:19:01,102
   <i>( piano glissando plays )</i>

1828
01:19:14,315 --> 01:19:17,284
    You know, as a parent,
     I have many regrets.

1829
01:19:17,318 --> 01:19:20,487
     I regret only caring
          about fame,

1830
01:19:20,505 --> 01:19:22,456
         money, women,

1831
01:19:22,490 --> 01:19:25,209
          sex, drugs.

1832
01:19:25,260 --> 01:19:29,713
I thought the definition
  of a good parent was being
     a financial provider.

1833
01:19:29,765 --> 01:19:33,634
     I totally missed out
    on the emotional part.

1834
01:19:33,668 --> 01:19:36,637
         And for that,
     I will always regret.

1835
01:19:36,671 --> 01:19:40,691
  You know, I'm just blessed
     that God has given me
      another opportunity

1836
01:19:40,725 --> 01:19:43,110
        to be a father
 for the children that I have

1837
01:19:43,145 --> 01:19:45,279
and that respect me now.

1838
01:19:45,313 --> 01:19:49,116
 My older kids need more time
     to forgive my absence
        and my relapse,

1839
01:19:49,151 --> 01:19:51,035
     but I just want them
to know that I love them

1840
01:19:51,069 --> 01:19:54,321
    and I will always
    be there for them
    whenever they need me.

1841
01:19:54,355 --> 01:19:58,459
       <i>¶ And I'm singing</i>
     <i>this song to you... ¶</i>

1842
01:19:58,493 --> 01:20:00,327
You know, nothing in life
     can ever prepare you

1843
01:20:00,361 --> 01:20:03,047
for the loss of a child.

1844
01:20:03,081 --> 01:20:06,867
    It just seemed to defy
  the laws of natural order.

1845
01:20:06,885 --> 01:20:10,421
        We, as parents,
    we're prepared to leave
this Earth before our children.

1846
01:20:10,472 --> 01:20:12,556
    Before we leave,
     we plan to guide them

1847
01:20:12,591 --> 01:20:14,892
         and make them
stronger people in life.

1848
01:20:19,815 --> 01:20:22,016
         It was a long
      Labor Day weekend,

1849
01:20:22,050 --> 01:20:24,568
    and I received the call
      from the paramedics

1850
01:20:24,603 --> 01:20:26,887
      at the house where
 Exodus lived with her mother

1851
01:20:26,905 --> 01:20:29,440
    and her older brother,
        my son Miguel.

1852
01:20:29,491 --> 01:20:33,611
They lived in Phoenix, Arizona,
and I lived in Las Vegas.

1853
01:20:33,662 --> 01:20:35,362
I still don't understand
        what happened.

1854
01:20:35,396 --> 01:20:37,081
      I don't understand
    why it happened.

1855
01:20:37,115 --> 01:20:38,833
    I don't know how
    a cord from a treadmill

1856
01:20:38,867 --> 01:20:42,569
    can get wrapped around
 a four-year-old girl's neck.

1857
01:20:42,587 --> 01:20:44,839
        I jumped
    on a plane immediately

1858
01:20:44,873 --> 01:20:46,423
      and I went straight
    to the hospital.

1859
01:20:46,458 --> 01:20:50,511
 Exodus was already brain-dead
        when I arrived.

1860
01:20:50,545 --> 01:20:53,597
It was the hardest thing
    I ever had to do.

1861
01:20:53,632 --> 01:20:55,749
         When I first
     went to the hospital,
      I was really angry

1862
01:20:55,767 --> 01:20:58,752
 and I wanted somebody to pay
     and feel how I felt.

1863
01:20:58,770 --> 01:21:02,056
 But when I saw other parents
    there that had children
        that were dying

1864
01:21:02,090 --> 01:21:04,475
or just died right there,
        at that moment,

1865
01:21:04,526 --> 01:21:06,977
and they came over to me
    and comforted me.

1866
01:21:07,028 --> 01:21:08,762
          We are all
    members of a club

1867
01:21:08,780 --> 01:21:10,364
        that we didn't
    want to be a part of--

1868
01:21:10,398 --> 01:21:12,199
  the bereaved parents club.

1869
01:21:12,234 --> 01:21:14,401
        Before we left,

1870
01:21:14,435 --> 01:21:16,654
 Exodus made her final ascent
          to heaven.

1871
01:21:17,939 --> 01:21:20,374
 You know, I can't bring back
        my baby Exodus,

1872
01:21:20,408 --> 01:21:23,043
  but the only thing I can do
    is honor her life

1873
01:21:23,078 --> 01:21:25,412
  by making a better example
        of myself

1874
01:21:25,446 --> 01:21:28,282
        for my children
  who are still with me now.

1875
01:21:29,384 --> 01:21:31,719
       <i>There isn't a day</i>
          <i>that goes by</i>

1876
01:21:31,753 --> 01:21:33,971
 <i>that I don't think about</i>
      <i>Exodus Sierra Tyson.</i>

1877
01:21:34,005 --> 01:21:38,309
   <i>She will forever always be</i>
       <i>my eternal angel.</i>

1878
01:21:41,629 --> 01:21:43,981
     These are my children
          right here.

1879
01:21:45,633 --> 01:21:47,651
    You know, I have, like,
     a 9th grade education

1880
01:21:47,686 --> 01:21:51,105
     from a really, really
 fucked up, bad school, right?

1881
01:21:51,139 --> 01:21:53,407
        And all my kids
     go to private schools

1882
01:21:53,441 --> 01:21:55,075
    and Ivy League schools,
            right?

1883
01:21:55,110 --> 01:21:56,994
    And every now and then
I text them and I see how
        they're doing,

1884
01:21:57,028 --> 01:21:58,746
    and they call me back--
     text me back and say,

1885
01:21:58,780 --> 01:22:00,698
    "Daddy, this is not how
you spell my name, Daddy.

1886
01:22:00,749 --> 01:22:02,783
      And you don't spell
  'birthday' like this, Dad.

1887
01:22:02,817 --> 01:22:04,785
        I can't believe
 you can't spell 'birthday.'"

1888
01:22:04,819 --> 01:22:06,653
But this is what my life
         is about now,

1889
01:22:06,671 --> 01:22:09,623
     being with my family
     and cherishing this.

1890
01:22:09,657 --> 01:22:13,043
    It took me a long time
    to get it, but, by God,
  you know, I got this shit.

1891
01:22:13,094 --> 01:22:15,596
          And-- man.

1892

      with many highs and
    many lows, guys,

1899

    but it's molded me into

    and his failures

01:22:45,210 --> 01:22:47,962
    emotionally naked
  as I came into this world.

    God bless you all
 and thank you for coming out
