1
00:00:05,533 --> 00:00:09,266
Of Sarah and Nick who, sadly,
will be leaving us

2
00:00:09,267 --> 00:00:10,499
for Missouri tomorrow.

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,732
: Boo!

4
00:00:12,733 --> 00:00:13,799
Yeah.

5
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:15,632
: Boo.

6
00:00:15,633 --> 00:00:16,767
Don't go.

7
00:00:17,967 --> 00:00:21,067
But, fortunately for them,
Missouri loves company.

8
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:26,399
Oh, come on, you don't like
that one?

9
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,732
I worked on it all last night.

10
00:00:27,733 --> 00:00:29,066
Anyway...

11
00:00:29,067 --> 00:00:30,966
Are there even any
health food stores out there?

12
00:00:30,967 --> 00:00:33,966
No, but I am gonna
be able to start that garden

13
00:00:33,967 --> 00:00:36,766
I always wanted and our food
source will be

14
00:00:36,767 --> 00:00:38,266
completely sustainable.

15
00:00:38,267 --> 00:00:41,799
Bravo, Sarah.

16
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:45,166
Oh, my God, guys, I'm like,
so proud of you, seriously.

17
00:00:45,167 --> 00:00:46,632
You're on the forefront.

18
00:00:46,633 --> 00:00:49,266
You're like in the battle
against our energy crisis,

19
00:00:49,267 --> 00:00:53,299
and we need people like you,
out there figuring stuff out,

20
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:54,666
you know.

21
00:00:54,667 --> 00:00:58,099
Building wind farms, or ethanol
crops, whatever it is

22
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:59,132
you have to do.

23
00:00:59,133 --> 00:01:01,299
You know, you have to solve
the problems.

24
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:03,599
It's important for the future
and it takes a lot of courage

25
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,266
and I'm all for it.

26
00:01:05,267 --> 00:01:07,199
What about the kids there,
are you gonna... are

27
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,499
you gonna keep trying for that?

28
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:11,466
Oh, definitely, but the
doctor said that maybe a change

29
00:01:11,467 --> 00:01:13,132
of scenery would help.

30
00:01:13,133 --> 00:01:15,099
So...

31
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:17,499
You know, I think maybe he
just meant like try doing it on

32
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,099
the living room floor or
something.

33
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:20,899
I don't think he meant, like,
you have to go to Missouri.

34
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:23,432
Yeah, he probably he did, but
oh well.

35
00:01:23,433 --> 00:01:27,032
So, this should really help.

36
00:01:27,033 --> 00:01:28,099
Everything okay with you?

37
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:29,466
You all right?

38
00:01:29,467 --> 00:01:31,499
Yeah.

39
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,699
I mean, is there anything
that you want... that

40
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:35,232
you want to talk about maybe?

41
00:01:35,233 --> 00:01:36,832
No.

42
00:01:36,833 --> 00:01:37,666
No? Not...

43
00:01:37,667 --> 00:01:40,766
No.

44
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:44,466
Some of you may know this,
but our Nick here is gonna

45
00:01:44,467 --> 00:01:48,266
be working in one of the largest
windmill parks

46
00:01:48,267 --> 00:01:49,632
in all of America.

47
00:01:49,633 --> 00:01:53,966
So, in honor of your journey I
wanted to present you guys

48
00:01:53,967 --> 00:01:55,899
with these little parting gifts.

49
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:59,066
- Oh nice.
- Look at those.

50
00:01:59,067 --> 00:02:01,333
Oh, my God, look is this?

51
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:06,866
Spin 'em! Spin 'em!

52
00:02:06,867 --> 00:02:08,867
Here's to going
where the wind blows you.

53
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,466
Bill?

54
00:02:34,467 --> 00:02:37,366
Nick.

55
00:02:37,367 --> 00:02:39,066
Nice to meet you.

56
00:02:39,067 --> 00:02:39,999
Hi, I'm Sarah.

57
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,400
Nice to meet you.

58
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:02,532
So, are we still in Nebraska,
Bill?

59
00:03:02,533 --> 00:03:03,732
Yep.

60
00:03:03,733 --> 00:03:05,599
We'll be in Rock Port in about
an hour.

61
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:09,799
Then we'll head on down to the
cabin in Hoot Owl Bend.

62
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,299
So, you're from Rock Port
originally, Bill?

63
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,566
Yep, born and raised.

64
00:03:13,567 --> 00:03:15,399
I went to school in Manhattan
though.

65
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,399
Hmm.

66
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,999
Wow, that must've been a
culture shock.

67
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,866
Not really.

68
00:03:18,867 --> 00:03:20,232
Manhattan's in Kansas.

69
00:03:20,233 --> 00:03:22,399
It's about an hour across the
Missouri border.

70
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,666
Oh.

71
00:03:23,667 --> 00:03:25,699
I thought you were talking
about the other Manhattan.

72
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:26,799
That's funny.

73
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,932
Yeah.

74
00:03:28,933 --> 00:03:31,666
Manhattan, Kansas is,
however, the home to longest

75
00:03:31,667 --> 00:03:38,233
continually operating Pizza Hut
store in the United States.

76
00:04:34,367 --> 00:04:37,599
Well, here she is.

77
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,699
Oh, by the way, I got you my
cousin's truck to drive until

78
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:41,766
you get a different one.

79
00:04:41,767 --> 00:04:43,267
Thanks.

80
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:06,067
That there is the Missouri
River.

81
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:23,999
Well, you wanted something
cheap, cheap it is.

82
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,966
I ain't done much with it since
the old man passed.

83
00:05:26,967 --> 00:05:28,832
You know, we used to come down
here spring and summers for the

84
00:05:28,833 --> 00:05:31,366
fishin'.

85
00:05:31,367 --> 00:05:33,766
Well, you got your bed over
here.

86
00:05:33,767 --> 00:05:37,632
You got your kitchen area over
here, stove and whatnot.

87
00:05:37,633 --> 00:05:41,199
So, what do you think?

88
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:44,032
It's nice.

89
00:05:44,033 --> 00:05:48,699
Yeah, it's... it's great.

90
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:51,233
Where's the bathroom?

91
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,399
Well now, as far as the
garden you wanted to plant

92
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,432
around here,
it's probably not a good idea to

93
00:05:59,433 --> 00:06:03,099
put it back here.

94
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:06,232
Yeah, this place is pretty well
saturated.

95
00:06:06,233 --> 00:06:09,733
Nice little spot around front
though.

96
00:06:17,233 --> 00:06:20,299
They say there's a bald eagle's
nest over here someplace.

97
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:22,732
They say seein' one's good luck.

98
00:06:22,733 --> 00:06:25,000
I never seen one myself.

99
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:34,566
All right, this covers you
for the first month's rent and

100
00:06:34,567 --> 00:06:36,066
the pickup.

101
00:06:36,067 --> 00:06:39,000
I'll see you tomorrow at the
office.

102
00:07:01,633 --> 00:07:02,332
Hey.

103
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:03,499
Hey.

104
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,466
You all right?

105
00:07:05,467 --> 00:07:07,266
There's no bathroom.

106
00:07:07,267 --> 00:07:09,366
Ah, it's only temporary, baby.

107
00:07:09,367 --> 00:07:13,166
You know, just think of it as a
wonderful camping trip, just you

108
00:07:13,167 --> 00:07:14,799
and me.

109
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,199
You know, you don't go
camping for more than two or

110
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,166
three days at a time, okay?

111
00:07:19,167 --> 00:07:23,232
People who camp for extended
periods are called "hobos."

112
00:07:23,233 --> 00:07:26,399
No, we're not hobos.

113
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,599
We are a very, very lucky
people.

114
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:35,733
I mean, look, it's beautiful.

115
00:07:36,767 --> 00:07:38,567
I know.

116
00:07:55,633 --> 00:07:57,966
All right, Nick.

117
00:07:57,967 --> 00:08:00,166
I got your test results here,
and I'd like to explain a little

118
00:08:00,167 --> 00:08:01,932
bit about what they mean.

119
00:08:01,933 --> 00:08:06,332
You can see these sperm cells
are irregular, or abnormal.

120
00:08:06,333 --> 00:08:10,099
Basically, these cells are
incapable of fertilizing an egg.

121
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,966
Is there anything I can
do to fix it?

122
00:08:11,967 --> 00:08:15,467
To be quite honest with you,
Nick, no.

123
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:53,532
Rock Port is the
first town in the.

124
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:56,399
United States to derive
100% of its energy

125
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,699
from wind power.

126
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:00,599
We have five competing wind
energy companies in the area,

127
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,032
but we are the biggest.

128
00:09:02,033 --> 00:09:05,932
We currently share this office
space with Trade Wind Energy.

129
00:09:05,933 --> 00:09:08,932
Now, if you'll look at the map
you'll see that we have about

130
00:09:08,933 --> 00:09:11,932
100,000 acres on our property.

131
00:09:11,933 --> 00:09:14,832
We do have two farms that are
closer to completion

132
00:09:14,833 --> 00:09:16,166
than the rest.

133
00:09:16,167 --> 00:09:18,432
One of them is near the Missouri
River and then the other one is

134
00:09:18,433 --> 00:09:20,599
in Fairfax, Missouri.

135
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:24,366
We have a lot of landowners who
have expressed an interest, but

136
00:09:24,367 --> 00:09:27,199
we haven't quite brought
them on board.

137
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,066
We're hoping that with all the
activity, and the benefits, and

138
00:09:30,067 --> 00:09:33,399
the community involvement that
they'll be on board soon.

139
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:36,332
So, do you have any questions,
Nick?

140
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:37,799
Uh, no.

141
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:38,866
Okay, then.

142
00:09:38,867 --> 00:09:40,932
Welcome to the Anamway Energy
Family.

143
00:09:40,933 --> 00:09:42,900
Thank you.

144
00:10:03,267 --> 00:10:05,232
Wow, these things
look so much bigger down

145
00:10:05,233 --> 00:10:06,232
on the ground.

146
00:10:06,233 --> 00:10:09,299
Yeah, and that's just
one blade.

147
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:11,566
Any drawbacks to these things?

148
00:10:11,567 --> 00:10:13,332
None that I've seen.

149
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:16,066
Some people don't like the looks
of 'em.

150
00:10:16,067 --> 00:10:19,099
My old man worked in a coal
refinery all his life.

151
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:22,000
These things are a hell of a lot
prettier than that.

152
00:12:45,633 --> 00:12:47,732
You know, being out
here makes me feel like a little

153
00:12:47,733 --> 00:12:49,999
kid again.

154
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,232
The fresh air, and rolling
around in the grass, grass

155
00:12:55,233 --> 00:12:56,632
stains.

156
00:12:56,633 --> 00:12:58,699
Ugh, grass stains.

157
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:01,399
I used to get in so much trouble
when I was a little kid.

158
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,432
You know, I would come home with
them all over my pants.

159
00:13:03,433 --> 00:13:05,732
My mom would want to kill me.

160
00:13:05,733 --> 00:13:07,532
Oh, and burdocks.

161
00:13:07,533 --> 00:13:11,499
Burdocks?

162
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,132
What are burdocks?

163
00:13:13,133 --> 00:13:14,666
You don't know about burdocks?

164
00:13:14,667 --> 00:13:15,932
No.

165
00:13:15,933 --> 00:13:18,532
Um, they're these awful
little dried up plants, like

166
00:13:18,533 --> 00:13:23,099
thistles, and my sister and I
would get them all in our hair

167
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:25,899
and we'd have to spend the rest
of the day picking them out.

168
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:28,967
It was a nightmare.

169
00:13:30,567 --> 00:13:34,567
Oh, baby, this would be a
wonderful place to raise kids.

170
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,532
I got two people in the
office, but it doesn't matter to

171
00:13:50,533 --> 00:13:53,166
me because I don't have to
report to an office ever again.

172
00:13:53,167 --> 00:13:56,799
Basically, what I do is I go
from farm to farm and I meet

173
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,532
with different farmers and I
make sure that they're happy.

174
00:13:59,533 --> 00:14:03,999
Uh... is everything okay?

175
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,232
Yeah, it's just that there's
this guy over at the bar who

176
00:14:06,233 --> 00:14:08,199
keeps staring at me.

177
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:12,766
Don't... stop, don't turn around.

178
00:14:12,767 --> 00:14:14,899
He's creeping me out.

179
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:18,532
Everybody's looking at us,
baby.

180
00:14:18,533 --> 00:14:20,333
Here you go.

181
00:15:17,133 --> 00:15:18,899
Today's the big day.

182
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:19,899
Are we going in?

183
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:21,399
Nah.

184
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,366
I got a call from Darius
Clemens, the farmer that owns

185
00:15:23,367 --> 00:15:25,866
this land.

186
00:15:25,867 --> 00:15:29,066
This unit went up about a week
ago and the workers left some

187
00:15:29,067 --> 00:15:31,599
pop cans and stuff layin' around
here.

188
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:39,033
So, what we're gonna do...
is clean it up.

189
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,632
So, how'd you get into this
line of work?

190
00:16:18,633 --> 00:16:23,033
Just the right place, the
right time, I guess.

191
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:33,932
♪ Just one
thing, I don't know what I'm

192
00:16:33,933 --> 00:16:38,733
fightin' ♪♪ - Hey, try these.

193
00:16:42,633 --> 00:16:45,166
Turn around.

194
00:16:45,167 --> 00:16:49,466
Mm, it's too baggy in the butt.

195
00:16:49,467 --> 00:16:51,599
You know, nobody's
looking at my butt when I'm

196
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,433
pickin' up garbage.

197
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,700
Bingo!

198
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:32,332
That's one good bingo!

199
00:17:32,333 --> 00:17:35,100
Damn, I was in.

200
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,499
Darius owns half the county.

201
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:04,033
He's even got his own Mexicans.

202
00:18:19,467 --> 00:18:20,932
Bill, what's the good word?

203
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:22,232
Nothin' much.

204
00:18:22,233 --> 00:18:25,366
Thanks for cleaning up my
ground over by turbine 27.

205
00:18:25,367 --> 00:18:26,832
Oh, not a problem, Darius.

206
00:18:26,833 --> 00:18:28,899
I just wanted to swing by and
introduce you to Nick.

207
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,799
He's going to be taking over for
me when Lana goes to Kansas.

208
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:31,732
City.

209
00:18:31,733 --> 00:18:33,532
Darius Clemens, good to meet
you.

210
00:18:33,533 --> 00:18:34,932
Good meeting you.

211
00:18:34,933 --> 00:18:37,832
Say, did I see you out to The
Black Iron the other night

212
00:18:37,833 --> 00:18:39,432
with a lovely young lady?

213
00:18:39,433 --> 00:18:40,632
Yes, that was my wife.

214
00:18:40,633 --> 00:18:41,732
I thought so.

215
00:18:41,733 --> 00:18:43,799
We don't see a lot of new faces
around here.

216
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,832
So, when you do see one
it really pops out

217
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:46,799
and you remember it.

218
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,699
So, where's Bill got you
stayin', Nick?

219
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:49,866
Hoot Owl Bend.

220
00:18:49,867 --> 00:18:52,499
You got him stayin' out to
your dad's old cabin?

221
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:53,799
Yep.

222
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:56,899
You know, my mom she used to
call that place,

223
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:58,232
"The Sugar Shanty."

224
00:18:58,233 --> 00:18:59,832
She never went out there because
she said that she wasn't givin'

225
00:18:59,833 --> 00:19:01,732
out any sugar.

226
00:19:01,733 --> 00:19:03,832
How 'bout you two comin' up here
tomorrow night for dinner, bring

227
00:19:03,833 --> 00:19:05,332
your better halves.

228
00:19:05,333 --> 00:19:07,666
I'd love to, Darius, but I
got bingo tomorrow night.

229
00:19:07,667 --> 00:19:08,699
Well, good luck with that.

230
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:10,066
Thanks.

231
00:19:10,067 --> 00:19:11,366
How about you, Nick?

232
00:19:11,367 --> 00:19:13,066
You want to bring your better
half up here and have dinner

233
00:19:13,067 --> 00:19:14,899
about six o'clock tomorrow
night?

234
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:16,066
Absolutely. I'd love to.

235
00:19:16,067 --> 00:19:17,032
Good.

236
00:19:17,033 --> 00:19:18,300
I'll see you then.

237
00:19:31,133 --> 00:19:32,899
That's some place he's got.

238
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:35,567
Yeah, you should see his wife.

239
00:19:40,133 --> 00:19:43,499
So, how do I look?

240
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:46,066
Great, babe.

241
00:19:46,067 --> 00:19:48,567
You're not even looking.

242
00:19:53,067 --> 00:19:55,532
What else do you got?

243
00:19:55,533 --> 00:19:58,366
Jesus, Nick, you bought me
this dress.

244
00:19:58,367 --> 00:19:59,632
A gift certificate, baby.

245
00:19:59,633 --> 00:20:01,432
You picked it out.

246
00:20:01,433 --> 00:20:06,799
After last week's evening out
I don't know what to expect.

247
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:09,066
There it is.

248
00:20:09,067 --> 00:20:11,432
What?

249
00:20:11,433 --> 00:20:14,799
The best look I've seen on
you all evening.

250
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:17,099
So, you're saying you only
think I look pretty when my tits

251
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:19,733
are hanging out.

252
00:20:25,233 --> 00:20:28,166
Darius Clemens thinks you're
very hot.

253
00:20:28,167 --> 00:20:30,099
Really?

254
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:32,600
I think you're really hot.

255
00:20:50,567 --> 00:20:55,432
Welcome! Glad you could make
it up to my neck of the woods.

256
00:20:55,433 --> 00:20:57,299
Oh, thanks for inviting us.

257
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:58,632
Darius Clemens.

258
00:20:58,633 --> 00:20:59,599
Good to meet you.

259
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,899
I'm Sarah.

260
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:04,166
Nick, you've got yourself one
beautiful lady here.

261
00:21:04,167 --> 00:21:08,466
Come on, let me show you two
around.

262
00:21:08,467 --> 00:21:13,666
When I bought this ground it was
nothin' but bluff ten years ago.

263
00:21:13,667 --> 00:21:15,132
Now look at it.

264
00:21:15,133 --> 00:21:16,566
It's amazing.

265
00:21:16,567 --> 00:21:19,699
My own little kingdom up here.

266
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:23,499
Right here, as you can see, are
some of my turbines.

267
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:27,799
Anamway pays me $15,000 per year
per turbine.

268
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:30,899
That increases yearly with
profit sharing.

269
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:34,866
Pretty good money to just sit on
my ground and spin.

270
00:21:34,867 --> 00:21:37,399
Maybe Bill should tear down that
cabin at Hoot Owl Bend and put

271
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,867
him up a turbine.

272
00:21:42,367 --> 00:21:45,299
Darius!

273
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:47,432
Right here's the
best thing on the place, my

274
00:21:47,433 --> 00:21:50,067
lovely wife, Madeline.

275
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,599
Most of the corn we grow is not
really for human consumption.

276
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:07,166
It's for ethanol gasoline, seed
corn, livestock feed, a little

277
00:22:07,167 --> 00:22:10,699
bit of popcorn here and there.

278
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:12,866
Oh, that's amazing.

279
00:22:12,867 --> 00:22:16,599
I got that out in Wyoming
about five years ago.

280
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,299
It's a big deer.

281
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:19,799
Elk.

282
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:22,666
Near perfect except for a slight
irregularity on the right

283
00:22:22,667 --> 00:22:25,132
antler.

284
00:22:25,133 --> 00:22:28,232
It's still a beautiful animal
though.

285
00:22:28,233 --> 00:22:30,232
Oh, you must be quite the
hunter.

286
00:22:30,233 --> 00:22:33,299
Not a hunter, more of a
collector.

287
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:36,233
He picked that up at an antiques
show a couple years back.

288
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:41,199
So, have you been to Rock
Port yet?

289
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:45,932
No, um, I've sort of been
stranded out at Hoot Owl Bend.

290
00:22:45,933 --> 00:22:48,099
Well, you must be goin' stir
crazy.

291
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:50,866
Well, tomorrow's Saturday,
are you doing anything?

292
00:22:50,867 --> 00:22:52,532
Why don't I take you to town?

293
00:22:52,533 --> 00:22:53,799
Oh, I'm not sure.

294
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,866
It's just that tomorrow is
Nick's day off and I don't want

295
00:22:55,867 --> 00:22:57,699
to leave him all by himself.

296
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:59,799
I'm taking him up north to
show him some ground I have up

297
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,599
there.

298
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,767
Good, it's decided.

299
00:23:26,767 --> 00:23:30,799
- Two things Missouri's
famous for: Sellin' fireworks

300
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,799
and meth.

301
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:36,666
My cousin owns that farm right
up there.

302
00:23:36,667 --> 00:23:40,199
My mom grew up on that farm
right down there behind those

303
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:42,799
trees.

304
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:46,566
There was a old lady we bought
eggs from who lived here.

305
00:23:46,567 --> 00:23:50,199
Eggs were 20 cents a dozen, and
when you'd buy the eggs they had

306
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,099
shit and feathers on the egg.

307
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:56,266
You just washed them eggs and... I
mean, the shit still stayed

308
00:23:56,267 --> 00:23:58,099
on 'em.

309
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:00,966
A lot of these places went broke
during the farming crisis of the

310
00:24:00,967 --> 00:24:02,932
'80s.

311
00:24:02,933 --> 00:24:06,966
So, now we have these rusted out
shitholes everywhere.

312
00:24:06,967 --> 00:24:09,766
It's sad.

313
00:24:09,767 --> 00:24:14,566
I remember it a different way
from when I was a little boy.

314
00:24:14,567 --> 00:24:17,466
Fortunately, wind turbines mean
money, you know, for a lot of

315
00:24:17,467 --> 00:24:19,299
these farmers.

316
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:23,100
Rain or shine, crop or no crop,
they always have an income.

317
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:34,299
How long have you and Nick
been married?

318
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:37,132
Um, it'll be four years this
June.

319
00:24:37,133 --> 00:24:39,699
So, you two thinkin' of
startin' a family soon?

320
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:42,032
Rock Port's the place to do it.

321
00:24:42,033 --> 00:24:44,799
Yeah, well, actually, um,
we've been workin' on that for a

322
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:49,699
while now, and it just hasn't
been as easy as we expected.

323
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:52,466
Maybe the fresh country air
will help.

324
00:24:52,467 --> 00:24:56,832
Yeah, well, that's what we're
hoping.

325
00:24:56,833 --> 00:24:58,899
When I was a kid I
couldn't wait to get out of this

326
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:00,466
town.

327
00:25:00,467 --> 00:25:04,399
But as I've gotten older, maybe
wiser, I've come to realize it's

328
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,599
not such a bad place to live.

329
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:11,132
And as far as being dead you
can't get any better.

330
00:25:11,133 --> 00:25:13,132
I love this place.

331
00:25:13,133 --> 00:25:14,399
Yeah.

332
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,166
I wouldn't mind being buried
here myself.

333
00:25:17,167 --> 00:25:20,032
I'm sorry, my friend, it is
all booked up.

334
00:25:20,033 --> 00:25:24,232
I've had my reservation since
before I was born.

335
00:25:24,233 --> 00:25:28,166
Meet my dad, Darius Clemens, Sr.

336
00:25:28,167 --> 00:25:29,866
Were you close to him?

337
00:25:29,867 --> 00:25:30,932
No.

338
00:25:30,933 --> 00:25:32,266
He was an old prick.

339
00:25:32,267 --> 00:25:33,932
Hmph.

340
00:25:33,933 --> 00:25:37,167
He was a good businessman,
though.

341
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:47,699
They never stop staring.

342
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:50,132
Why do they do that?

343
00:25:50,133 --> 00:25:52,166
Because we're outsiders.

344
00:25:52,167 --> 00:25:56,199
And by outsiders I mean we
weren't born in Rock Port.

345
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:59,599
Oh, everyone I've met so far
has been really nice.

346
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,932
Oh, they're nice to your
face, but the minute you turn

347
00:26:01,933 --> 00:26:04,499
around they're nasty gossips.

348
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:09,999
I've heard rumors spread
about myself and others.

349
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,733
They're not worth repeating.

350
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:24,900
You're up.

351
00:26:34,667 --> 00:26:36,166
Nah, here.

352
00:26:36,167 --> 00:26:39,199
Come on, you gotta... you
gotta line your sights up there.

353
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:43,067
Okay?

354
00:26:45,933 --> 00:26:46,899
Yeah.

355
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:48,266
Yeah.

356
00:26:48,267 --> 00:26:51,032
My dad put that grain Quonset
in one year as a father's day

357
00:26:51,033 --> 00:26:53,032
present.

358
00:26:53,033 --> 00:26:54,066
It's big.

359
00:26:54,067 --> 00:26:55,032
Yep.

360
00:26:55,033 --> 00:26:57,199
It's all about braggin' rights.

361
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:01,099
The bigger it is the more there
is to brag about, the more they

362
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:02,532
respect you.

363
00:27:02,533 --> 00:27:04,366
It's the same thing in New
York City.

364
00:27:04,367 --> 00:27:07,232
It's all about the square
footage of your apartment, the

365
00:27:07,233 --> 00:27:09,266
size of your bank account.

366
00:27:09,267 --> 00:27:11,466
Yeah, but you don't strike me
as the kind of person who's

367
00:27:11,467 --> 00:27:13,366
concerned with that sort of
thing.

368
00:27:13,367 --> 00:27:14,866
Nah, not really.

369
00:27:14,867 --> 00:27:16,632
I don't need much to survive.

370
00:27:16,633 --> 00:27:19,499
So, you came out here to good
old Rock Port to lead the simple

371
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:21,266
life.

372
00:27:21,267 --> 00:27:23,132
I guess you could say that.

373
00:27:23,133 --> 00:27:26,432
That's a good dream, but your
wife's gonna beat it out of you

374
00:27:26,433 --> 00:27:28,866
eventually.

375
00:27:28,867 --> 00:27:30,533
Thank you.

376
00:27:36,067 --> 00:27:40,732
My life is based on what I
own, my ground.

377
00:27:40,733 --> 00:27:43,999
Without owning land out here the
best you can hope for is to farm

378
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:49,132
someone else's or drive an hour
to work in a factory somewhere.

379
00:27:49,133 --> 00:27:51,233
That'd kill me.

380
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:57,933
Let's get out of here!

381
00:28:27,233 --> 00:28:30,866
Do you think Madeline's pretty?

382
00:28:30,867 --> 00:28:34,132
She's okay.

383
00:28:34,133 --> 00:28:38,066
Just okay?

384
00:28:38,067 --> 00:28:43,566
She's attractive enough, I
guess.

385
00:28:43,567 --> 00:28:47,732
Do you think I'm attractive
enough?

386
00:28:47,733 --> 00:28:49,866
Of course, babe.

387
00:28:49,867 --> 00:28:52,766
Why?

388
00:28:52,767 --> 00:28:56,932
Nick, this is a really good
time for me.

389
00:28:56,933 --> 00:28:59,066
Getting you pregnant is just
not first on my priority list

390
00:28:59,067 --> 00:29:01,599
right now.

391
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,933
It should be our first
priority!

392
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:17,766
I'm sorry, babe.

393
00:29:17,767 --> 00:29:20,599
I didn't mean that.

394
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:25,499
I just thought that coming
here might help, you know?

395
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:30,199
A change of scenery, we'd be
more relaxed, but I'm scared,

396
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,299
Nick.

397
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:32,332
What if I can't?

398
00:29:32,333 --> 00:29:33,966
Of course you can.

399
00:29:33,967 --> 00:29:37,599
Do you promise, promise we
can try?

400
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:40,833
I promise.

401
00:31:03,267 --> 00:31:05,366
So, Bill told me you
were up here.

402
00:31:05,367 --> 00:31:07,432
I thought you might be able to
use a beer.

403
00:31:07,433 --> 00:31:09,632
Thanks, Darius.

404
00:31:09,633 --> 00:31:11,632
So, how's Anamway?

405
00:31:11,633 --> 00:31:13,132
No complaints.

406
00:31:13,133 --> 00:31:14,599
How's the pay?

407
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:19,032
That could be better.

408
00:31:19,033 --> 00:31:21,766
Nick, if you don't mind me
asking, just what are you tryin'

409
00:31:21,767 --> 00:31:23,999
to do there?

410
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,999
Well, I'd like to move up in
the company.

411
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,432
Eventually get into planning.

412
00:31:29,433 --> 00:31:31,332
You talk to Bill about that?

413
00:31:31,333 --> 00:31:32,666
Nah.

414
00:31:32,667 --> 00:31:35,232
Not yet.

415
00:31:35,233 --> 00:31:37,532
Bill's a man of few words.

416
00:31:37,533 --> 00:31:42,500
You might wanna pin him down,
get some answers.

417
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:01,233
Thanks, hon.

418
00:32:05,267 --> 00:32:10,166
So, Bill, I've been doing a
little bit of thinking, and I

419
00:32:10,167 --> 00:32:12,932
think I'm ready to move on.

420
00:32:12,933 --> 00:32:14,566
Ready to quit already?

421
00:32:14,567 --> 00:32:17,966
No, move on to the next phase
of my job with Anamway.

422
00:32:17,967 --> 00:32:20,532
Well, you're doing the job I
trained you for right now.

423
00:32:20,533 --> 00:32:23,099
I haven't even been inside of
a turbine yet.

424
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:24,199
And you may not.

425
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:27,832
The only people we let up there
are engineers.

426
00:32:27,833 --> 00:32:30,832
Okay, when I took this job
they said that I could move up

427
00:32:30,833 --> 00:32:32,832
the company.

428
00:32:32,833 --> 00:32:35,332
Well, if you want to relocate
to Kansas City...

429
00:32:35,333 --> 00:32:36,932
Kansas City?

430
00:32:36,933 --> 00:32:38,666
If you want to relocate to
Kansas City, you can take some

431
00:32:38,667 --> 00:32:42,666
training classes, and get on the
maintenance side, which would

432
00:32:42,667 --> 00:32:45,066
be oiling the turbines and
getting the grease out of the

433
00:32:45,067 --> 00:32:48,199
main shaft, but either way you
look at it, Nick, you're

434
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:51,500
cleaning up the inside or you're
cleaning up the outside.

435
00:34:37,967 --> 00:34:40,499
What is this?

436
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:43,732
It's cereal.

437
00:34:43,733 --> 00:34:46,966
I know what it is.

438
00:34:46,967 --> 00:34:49,466
We don't have any milk?

439
00:34:49,467 --> 00:34:51,666
No, Nick, we don't have milk.

440
00:34:51,667 --> 00:34:53,966
In case you forgot, I don't have
a car, and you haven't gotten

441
00:34:53,967 --> 00:34:59,067
groceries in three days, except
for beer, of course.

442
00:35:03,433 --> 00:35:05,567
That's disgusting.

443
00:35:09,533 --> 00:35:11,599
It's not that bad.

444
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:14,232
First, you start pissing out
our window, and now this?

445
00:35:14,233 --> 00:35:16,099
I'm not going out to that
shit house at 2 a.m. to take a

446
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:17,499
piss.

447
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:20,433
You're destroying my garden.

448
00:35:22,467 --> 00:35:25,567
Don't walk away from me, Nick!

449
00:35:54,367 --> 00:35:57,732
So, how you like the
local cuisine?

450
00:35:57,733 --> 00:35:59,932
It's great.

451
00:35:59,933 --> 00:36:04,866
Well, it's not gourmet, but
it does the trick.

452
00:36:04,867 --> 00:36:07,632
So, I thought this place was
only supposed to be temporary.

453
00:36:07,633 --> 00:36:08,866
It is.

454
00:36:08,867 --> 00:36:14,333
I'm working with Anamway to get
something better soon.

455
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:30,632
Is everything all right, Nick?

456
00:36:30,633 --> 00:36:33,199
Yeah, I'm fine.

457
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:36,532
Listen, I don't want to
overstep my boundaries, but I've

458
00:36:36,533 --> 00:36:39,399
been thinkin' about what we
talked about.

459
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:43,766
There's something I want to tell
you.

460
00:36:43,767 --> 00:36:47,332
I think you're wasting
your time at Anamway.

461
00:36:47,333 --> 00:36:51,432
- Well, I...
- Look, just hear me out.

462
00:36:51,433 --> 00:36:54,699
I know you came out here on a
mission and I commend you, but

463
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:58,199
sometimes things don't work out
the way you planned, trust me.

464
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:01,499
I've got a lot of experience
with that.

465
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:05,066
The bottom line is you've got
your wife stranded out here for

466
00:37:05,067 --> 00:37:06,732
a month?

467
00:37:06,733 --> 00:37:10,366
Now, you don't want her to go on
like that, do you?

468
00:37:10,367 --> 00:37:13,466
No.

469
00:37:13,467 --> 00:37:15,899
I want you to come and work
for me.

470
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,966
I have a few side jobs I can
give you.

471
00:37:17,967 --> 00:37:20,199
Darius, I'm not lookin' for
charity.

472
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:22,299
Listen, I don't do charity.

473
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:27,466
I'm just as shrewd as my dad,
maybe twice as mean.

474
00:37:27,467 --> 00:37:31,700
Just think about it.

475
00:37:37,067 --> 00:37:41,900
If you want me you know where
to find me.

476
00:39:37,067 --> 00:39:40,432
Darius is over in
Brownville evicting someone.

477
00:39:40,433 --> 00:39:41,432
Yikes.

478
00:39:41,433 --> 00:39:44,132
You know Darius, he's all
business.

479
00:39:44,133 --> 00:39:46,999
Yeah, that's actually what
I'm here to talk to him about.

480
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:52,900
He should be back in a minute.

481
00:39:58,233 --> 00:39:59,399
This is really good.

482
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:02,266
It's actually the best breakfast
I've had in a while.

483
00:40:02,267 --> 00:40:04,099
Sarah's not much of a cook?

484
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:07,099
Um, she's not much of a
morning person.

485
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:08,366
That's a shame.

486
00:40:08,367 --> 00:40:13,432
I think morning's the best time
for men and women.

487
00:40:13,433 --> 00:40:15,199
Juice?

488
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:18,332
Um, no, I'm fine.

489
00:40:18,333 --> 00:40:20,700
Well, look who's here.

490
00:40:27,967 --> 00:40:30,399
Now, Nick, as you know I
own a lot of ground in this

491
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,666
county.

492
00:40:31,667 --> 00:40:34,099
Most of what I do on a daily
basis is keep an eye on that

493
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:37,499
ground, make sure everything is
in good repair, rents are paid

494
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:38,866
on time.

495
00:40:38,867 --> 00:40:42,666
Now, I can pay pretty good,
Nick, but what I need from you

496
00:40:42,667 --> 00:40:46,566
is a guarantee that what happens
between us stays between us.

497
00:40:46,567 --> 00:40:49,366
I don't like just anyone knowing
my business.

498
00:40:49,367 --> 00:40:51,466
Of course.

499
00:40:51,467 --> 00:40:54,466
Good.

500
00:40:54,467 --> 00:40:57,566
Now, our first order of business
today is to go out and get a

501
00:40:57,567 --> 00:40:58,067
beer.

502
00:41:19,033 --> 00:41:20,266
Hi there.

503
00:41:20,267 --> 00:41:21,332
Hi.

504
00:41:21,333 --> 00:41:23,032
Did I wake you up?

505
00:41:23,033 --> 00:41:24,632
Oh, no, I was up.

506
00:41:24,633 --> 00:41:27,800
I brought you some flowers
for your garden.

507
00:41:32,067 --> 00:41:35,566
I've been curious to see the
famous "Sugar Shanty."

508
00:41:35,567 --> 00:41:40,332
Right, I feel like we're the
standing joke.

509
00:41:40,333 --> 00:41:44,399
Well, I'd, I'd offer you some
coffee, but we're all out.

510
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,666
That's fine, I had some
earlier this morning.

511
00:41:46,667 --> 00:41:48,299
With Nick, in fact.

512
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:49,766
Oh, really?

513
00:41:49,767 --> 00:41:51,632
He came over to see Darius.

514
00:41:51,633 --> 00:41:55,532
Those two are really hittin' it
off.

515
00:41:55,533 --> 00:41:57,499
Well, I think it's cute.

516
00:41:57,500 --> 00:42:01,166
I love what you've done with it.

517
00:42:01,167 --> 00:42:02,899
Thanks.

518
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:06,366
It's dark, though, which has
to be rough.

519
00:42:06,367 --> 00:42:08,766
I know if I didn't have light in
my home I'd probably sleep all

520
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:12,566
day.

521
00:42:12,567 --> 00:42:14,667
So, where's the garden?

522
00:42:22,467 --> 00:42:24,766
It's not doing very well.

523
00:42:24,767 --> 00:42:26,832
Maybe the soil's no good.

524
00:42:26,833 --> 00:42:29,499
I'll send Juan and Enrico
down, he'll bring you some fresh

525
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:30,999
soil.

526
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:31,932
No, that's fine.

527
00:42:31,933 --> 00:42:33,799
I'll make it work.

528
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:36,299
Sarah, I know this has been a
rough transition for you.

529
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:38,766
I mean, I can see it.

530
00:42:38,767 --> 00:42:41,499
Oh, thanks, Madeline, but I'm
fine.

531
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:43,599
You don't look fine.

532
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:46,566
Honestly, I'm fine.

533
00:42:46,567 --> 00:42:51,433
Well, if you need anything
just give me a ring.

534
00:44:39,867 --> 00:44:43,132
Did you come inside me?

535
00:44:43,133 --> 00:44:44,232
Hello?

536
00:44:44,233 --> 00:44:46,433
It doesn't matter.

537
00:44:59,833 --> 00:45:03,300
You checkin' out the local
talent?

538
00:45:05,733 --> 00:45:08,200
Yeah.

539
00:45:12,467 --> 00:45:15,466
They call 'em "Lot Lizards."

540
00:45:15,467 --> 00:45:18,699
Most of 'em are meth heads.

541
00:45:18,700 --> 00:45:22,966
They'll fuck anything
that moves.

542
00:45:22,967 --> 00:45:26,799
Jump in the cab of these
truckers who are parked here for

543
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:33,966
the night, get in the back, ride
'em, suck 'em, you name it.

544
00:45:33,967 --> 00:45:40,199
And then jump out, go on down to
the next truck.

545
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:44,966
That one right there, she's got
a husband waitin' on her

546
00:45:44,967 --> 00:45:47,267
up in lowa.

547
00:46:01,267 --> 00:46:05,332
Hey, Darius.

548
00:46:05,333 --> 00:46:07,632
You can't be feelin' too good.

549
00:46:07,633 --> 00:46:09,232
Uhuh.

550
00:46:09,233 --> 00:46:12,800
Well, you better hit the
showers, we got work to do.

551
00:49:26,467 --> 00:49:30,566
Have we had sex in
every room of this place?

552
00:49:30,567 --> 00:49:33,499
Yeah.

553
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:36,100
We can try the pantry next.

554
00:50:51,967 --> 00:50:53,766
I'll take care of it.

555
00:50:53,767 --> 00:50:54,832
Okay.

556
00:50:54,833 --> 00:50:56,099
Talk to you soon.

557
00:50:56,100 --> 00:50:57,400
Thanks, buddy.

558
00:50:59,367 --> 00:51:02,332
It's Rick Watkins over at Fox
Farms, said you never made it

559
00:51:02,333 --> 00:51:04,232
out to see him today.

560
00:51:04,233 --> 00:51:05,466
I had an emergency.

561
00:51:05,467 --> 00:51:08,566
Is everything okay?

562
00:51:08,567 --> 00:51:12,567
You had an emergency, you didn't
have time to call me?

563
00:51:13,667 --> 00:51:14,999
I'll tell you now what, Nick.

564
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,532
This isn't the first time this
has happened.

565
00:51:17,533 --> 00:51:19,432
I can't just drop everything
here because you have

566
00:51:19,433 --> 00:51:20,432
an emergency.

567
00:51:20,433 --> 00:51:22,266
You didn't call, you didn't
let me know.

568
00:51:22,267 --> 00:51:23,466
What's going on, Nick?

569
00:51:23,467 --> 00:51:25,866
It's a very, very easy job.

570
00:51:25,867 --> 00:51:27,832
I just... I
need to know that you're gonna

571
00:51:27,833 --> 00:51:29,632
be there for me.

572
00:51:29,633 --> 00:51:31,699
I need you to make a commitment
to me that you're gonna do

573
00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:33,000
better.

574
00:53:00,300 --> 00:53:01,732
I'm tired, babe.

575
00:53:01,733 --> 00:53:03,432
Please, Nick.

576
00:53:03,433 --> 00:53:04,732
I miss you so much.

577
00:53:04,733 --> 00:53:06,799
I don't feel like it, okay?

578
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:11,133
You never feel like it.

579
00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:15,599
Maybe we can see someone.

580
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:17,732
What?

581
00:53:17,733 --> 00:53:20,432
There's a fertility clinic
in Kansas City.

582
00:53:20,433 --> 00:53:22,499
No.

583
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:24,566
What do you mean, "No?"

584
00:53:24,567 --> 00:53:26,632
I thought you said we weren't
gonna try so hard.

585
00:53:26,633 --> 00:53:29,999
We haven't been trying at all.

586
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,666
Two months out here, and you
don't even talk to me, let alone

587
00:53:32,667 --> 00:53:34,366
touch me.

588
00:53:34,367 --> 00:53:37,066
All you do is hang around
with Darius and Madeline.

589
00:53:37,067 --> 00:53:38,466
I work for them.

590
00:53:38,467 --> 00:53:39,866
I'm lonely, Nick.

591
00:53:39,867 --> 00:53:41,566
Can't you understand that?

592
00:53:41,567 --> 00:53:44,967
Loneliness isn't a good
reason to have kids.

593
00:53:51,433 --> 00:53:53,266
You're a fucking loser, Nick!

594
00:53:53,267 --> 00:53:55,232
You're a fucking loser!

595
00:53:55,233 --> 00:53:57,233
We're gonna make babies.

596
00:53:58,433 --> 00:54:01,399
: Get the f...
- You want to make babies?

597
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:02,532
You want to make babies?

598
00:54:02,533 --> 00:54:04,532
Nick, stop!

599
00:54:04,533 --> 00:54:07,300
Stop, Nick! Oww!

600
00:57:54,833 --> 00:57:58,733
Nick, put that down and get
in the truck!

601
00:58:18,900 --> 00:58:21,067
I'll be right back.

602
00:58:51,567 --> 00:58:53,132
Go on back to the truck!

603
00:58:53,133 --> 00:58:53,966
What's going on?

604
00:58:53,967 --> 00:58:54,866
Go on back.

605
00:58:54,867 --> 00:58:55,666
Go on, drive.

606
00:58:55,667 --> 00:58:56,599
Go on, drive.

607
00:58:56,600 --> 00:58:57,532
Drive.

608
00:58:57,533 --> 00:58:58,033
Drive.

609
00:59:02,567 --> 00:59:04,733
All right, let's drive.

610
00:59:16,567 --> 00:59:19,300
Woo!

611
00:59:23,300 --> 00:59:25,832
Damn, I got a little blood on
me.

612
00:59:25,833 --> 00:59:29,599
That was we call a "forced
eviction."

613
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:34,432
Hey, where are you goin'?

614
00:59:34,433 --> 00:59:37,232
Look, I don't want my property
burnt to the ground by some

615
00:59:37,233 --> 00:59:39,499
lowlife, scud bud, meth head.

616
00:59:39,500 --> 00:59:41,799
You're fucking insane.

617
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:43,932
I don't care what people do
in the privacy of their own

618
00:59:43,933 --> 00:59:46,566
homes, but when they start
takin' that shit to the

619
00:59:46,567 --> 00:59:49,632
streets... and the streets
of my hometown, that

620
00:59:49,633 --> 00:59:50,932
is where I draw the line!

621
00:59:50,933 --> 00:59:53,266
So, you take me on a
vigilante drug bust?

622
00:59:53,267 --> 00:59:54,866
You're fucking nuts, Darius!

623
00:59:54,867 --> 00:59:57,066
You wouldn't know a vigilante
drug bust if it stuck you in the

624
00:59:57,067 --> 00:59:58,932
goddamned ass!

625
00:59:58,933 --> 01:00:00,066
You get back to that truck!

626
01:00:00,067 --> 01:00:03,266
You are... You're on my time!

627
01:00:03,267 --> 01:00:04,732
Oh, yeah, run on back!

628
01:00:04,733 --> 01:00:06,132
Run on back to New York City!

629
01:00:06,133 --> 01:00:08,432
You never owned shit and
you wouldn't know how to take

630
01:00:08,433 --> 01:00:10,500
care of it if you did!

631
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:36,999
I want to invite you and your
wife to dinner tonight.

632
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:41,632
You want to come?

633
01:01:41,633 --> 01:01:43,367
Sure.

634
01:02:39,067 --> 01:02:41,399
So, Madeline and I have
been thinking, and we've got

635
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:44,299
something that we want to run by
you guys.

636
01:02:44,300 --> 01:02:47,099
I own a little farmhouse just
outside of Brownville, and I've

637
01:02:47,100 --> 01:02:49,366
been rentin' it to some people.

638
01:02:49,367 --> 01:02:53,199
It's a nice little place, fully
renovated indoor toilet.

639
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:55,832
They're moving out the end of
the month and, uh, well, we'd

640
01:02:55,833 --> 01:02:58,766
like to move you guys in.

641
01:02:58,767 --> 01:03:02,532
That being said, Nick, you've
been doin' a great job here and

642
01:03:02,533 --> 01:03:05,632
I'd like to hire you on
full-time.

643
01:03:05,633 --> 01:03:11,300
I would be honored to accept.

644
01:03:16,633 --> 01:03:19,633
I'll be right back.

645
01:03:23,033 --> 01:03:25,166
What are you doing?

646
01:03:25,167 --> 01:03:26,732
"I'd be honored"?

647
01:03:26,733 --> 01:03:28,766
They're going to give us a
freaking house!

648
01:03:28,767 --> 01:03:30,166
So what?

649
01:03:30,167 --> 01:03:31,899
- Look...
- Maybe, I don't want to live

650
01:03:31,900 --> 01:03:33,266
in this fucking town for the
rest of my life!

651
01:03:33,267 --> 01:03:34,599
Do not start that car!

652
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:36,166
You're not gonna leave me here
without wheels.

653
01:03:36,167 --> 01:03:36,899
Yeah.

654
01:03:36,900 --> 01:03:37,899
Do you understand me?

655
01:03:37,900 --> 01:03:39,066
Try not having wheels for two
months!

656
01:03:39,067 --> 01:03:39,899
You're not gonna... no, no, no.

657
01:03:39,900 --> 01:03:40,666
Get the fuck out of my way!

658
01:03:40,667 --> 01:03:43,133
You're a fucking loser!

659
01:03:55,833 --> 01:03:57,199
Is everything all right?

660
01:03:57,200 --> 01:03:58,499
Yeah, yeah.

661
01:03:58,500 --> 01:04:00,500
Everything's fine.

662
01:04:02,100 --> 01:04:03,532
Where's Sarah?

663
01:04:03,533 --> 01:04:06,666
She left, but, uh, she'll get
over it.

664
01:04:06,667 --> 01:04:08,499
Nick, you shouldn't have let
her go.

665
01:04:08,500 --> 01:04:09,266
She's been drinking.

666
01:04:09,267 --> 01:04:10,266
I'll go get her.

667
01:04:10,267 --> 01:04:12,199
Darius, that's really
unnecessary.

668
01:04:12,200 --> 01:04:13,466
Madeline's right.

669
01:04:13,467 --> 01:04:16,200
She couldn't have gotten far.

670
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:33,666
Hey, can I buy you another
drink?

671
01:04:33,667 --> 01:04:34,899
No, thanks.

672
01:04:34,900 --> 01:04:36,367
Okay.

673
01:04:40,867 --> 01:04:43,733
Hey, this is from your
friend down there.

674
01:05:27,867 --> 01:05:30,233
Hit me again.

675
01:05:33,900 --> 01:05:37,032
You wanna smoke?

676
01:05:37,033 --> 01:05:39,800
Let's do it.

677
01:05:56,067 --> 01:05:58,566
I drove up about a mile, but
I didn't see any other cars

678
01:05:58,567 --> 01:06:00,799
along the highway.

679
01:06:00,800 --> 01:06:03,999
She must've been drivin' pretty
fast.

680
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:08,632
Or maybe she stopped along the
way.

681
01:06:08,633 --> 01:06:10,466
Fuck me.

682
01:06:10,467 --> 01:06:12,199
What?

683
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:15,067
I want you to fuck me.

684
01:07:10,900 --> 01:07:13,733
Harder! Harder!

685
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:17,332
Yeah!

686
01:07:17,333 --> 01:07:19,932
You see the way he satisfies me!

687
01:07:19,933 --> 01:07:21,299
Oh, yes!

688
01:07:21,300 --> 01:07:22,866
Fucking good!

689
01:07:22,867 --> 01:07:24,332
He's the best.

690
01:07:24,333 --> 01:07:25,733
He's the shit.

691
01:09:48,200 --> 01:09:51,466
You know that Eskimos
share their wives, right, Nick?

692
01:09:51,467 --> 01:09:54,099
Yeah, I think I've heard that
before.

693
01:09:54,100 --> 01:09:56,166
Well, a common misconception
is they share 'em with just

694
01:09:56,167 --> 01:09:58,632
anyone.

695
01:09:58,633 --> 01:10:01,432
What Darius is trying to say
is that he likes to watch other

696
01:10:01,433 --> 01:10:03,932
men fuck me.

697
01:10:03,933 --> 01:10:06,932
I've watched over half the
men in this county sweat over

698
01:10:06,933 --> 01:10:07,766
her.

699
01:10:07,767 --> 01:10:11,566
I loved every minute of it.

700
01:10:11,567 --> 01:10:13,567
But this was special.

701
01:10:21,367 --> 01:10:23,067
Nick!

702
01:10:45,133 --> 01:10:50,199
Hey, you know things ain't
always what they seem.

703
01:10:50,200 --> 01:10:54,032
Come on back here.

704
01:10:54,033 --> 01:10:58,532
Come on back here and let me
tell you something.

705
01:10:58,533 --> 01:11:01,632
You ain't got your pickup truck
anyway, huh.

706
01:11:01,633 --> 01:11:03,267
Come on back here.

707
01:11:04,533 --> 01:11:05,766
Come on, come on, come on.

708
01:11:05,767 --> 01:11:08,666
You just need somebody.

709
01:11:08,667 --> 01:11:12,799
Sometimes good people are
bad, the bad people are good.

710
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:15,966
Maybe you think I'm bad,
I don't know.

711
01:11:15,967 --> 01:11:19,232
We all got a little bad in us.

712
01:11:19,233 --> 01:11:25,332
I want you stay on, work for us.

713
01:11:25,333 --> 01:11:29,432
It's a pretty good job.

714
01:11:29,433 --> 01:11:31,999
You and Madeline want to play
sometime, that's fine.

715
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,532
I don't have to watch.

716
01:11:34,533 --> 01:11:38,099
You need to learn
how to be a man.

717
01:11:38,100 --> 01:11:40,932
You may look beautiful when you,
uh, when you fuck my wife, but

718
01:11:40,933 --> 01:11:42,366
that don't mean you're a man!

719
01:11:42,367 --> 01:11:44,999
Go ahead and beat
the shit outta me.

720
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:46,232
You think I wouldn't like it?

721
01:11:46,233 --> 01:11:47,800
You think I wouldn't like it?

722
01:11:52,100 --> 01:11:58,899
Look, Nick... I just...

723
01:11:58,900 --> 01:12:01,499
I just want...

724
01:12:01,500 --> 01:12:04,300
I just want to love you.

725
01:13:03,567 --> 01:13:07,400
I don't want to go anywhere
with you!

726
01:13:11,200 --> 01:13:14,566
You all right?

727
01:13:14,567 --> 01:13:17,367
You okay?

728
01:14:34,867 --> 01:14:37,567
Thanks.

729
01:14:44,567 --> 01:14:47,733
I want to go home.

730
01:15:13,900 --> 01:15:14,732
They're beautiful.

731
01:15:14,733 --> 01:15:15,999
Windmills are beautiful.

732
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:17,199
It's like ballet, you know?

733
01:15:17,200 --> 01:15:18,999
They just, like, they go around
and around.

734
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:20,366
It's very hypnotic, you know?

735
01:15:20,367 --> 01:15:23,432
I was in Oman, driving down the
dunes, they have, like, sea... a

736
01:15:23,433 --> 01:15:25,966
sea of windmills, and it...
Really, it's like,

737
01:15:25,967 --> 01:15:26,966
it's the future.

738
01:15:26,967 --> 01:15:28,066
You're looking at the future.

739
01:15:28,067 --> 01:15:29,732
Being off the grid.

740
01:15:29,733 --> 01:15:31,899
Being non-energy
dependent on oil.

741
01:15:31,900 --> 01:15:32,732
Self-sufficient.

742
01:15:32,733 --> 01:15:34,167
I mean, seriously, yeah.

743
01:15:39,667 --> 01:15:41,667
[rock music playing faintly]

744
01:16:04,567 --> 01:16:06,199
You are glowing.

745
01:16:06,200 --> 01:16:07,566
Aww, thank you.

746
01:16:07,567 --> 01:16:09,066
And we're still on for
brunch tomorrow?

747
01:16:09,067 --> 01:16:09,932
Definitely.

748
01:16:09,933 --> 01:16:11,200
I'll see you guys tomorrow.
