by Sofi

2
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:29,299
There's no doubt that
when I was a kid...

3
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:30,700
Always was called...

4
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:32,680
...different.

5
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,299
Yeah. That's me,
Danny Waldesakee the second...

6
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,520
...followed by my loving family.

7
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:41,550
They're always trying to help.

8
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,160
Always trying to save me from myself.

9
00:00:49,761 --> 00:00:51,461
Danny?

10
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:54,760
Are you alright?

11
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:57,430
Honey, are you ok?

12
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,199
Sweety, talk to me,
Are you alright?

13
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,020
I'm ok.

14
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,190
- Way to go, asshole.
- Lorenzo!

15
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:11,499
My mother was a kind of person, who's love
could kill you if you weren't careful.

16
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:15,820
Guess she blamed herself for
I was born 3 months premature.

17
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,470
I was just in a hurry to get out!

18
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:20,070
I'm always in a hurry.

19
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:23,440
- Hey, Danny.
- Hi

20
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,270
.. put your hands.
Daddy, can I hit?

21
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:33,099
No,it's Danny's turn. Here we go.

22
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:36,299
I am gonna pull this thing right at the ball,
it's gonna make that noise.

23
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:37,699
When you hear it, wack it.
swing..

24
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:40,850
You suck!

25
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,499
My dad was cool. He never were
like my mom.

26
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:47,699
He knew that I didn't wanna
go to blind school

27
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,699
So he sent me to normal school.

28
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:51,899
And he let me and my brother visit him
at work.

29
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:54,899
Help! There two blind kids robbin a train,
Help!

30
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:56,180
Larry, my brother.

31
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:59,640
Only two years elder than me,
was a boy with a mission.

32
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:02,370
He took up by himself in an early age:
teach me about life.

33
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:08,699
- Come on, Danny, you will like it.
- Don't do that, remember Last time!

34
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:12,599
You keep out of this. This
candy is not for little girls.

35
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,670
This candy's is only for men.
Come on..

36
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,900
Danny take a piece.

37
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:21,620
Yeah, dog shit again!

38
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,760
As we grew up, Larry's life-lessons
continue.

39
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,100
What's happening?

40
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,380
Is she dying?

41
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:39,830
In front of Danny!

42
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,899
What's the problem, he can't see nothin.

43
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:42,790
God can see!

44
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:48,410
Nedless to say that by the time
I was a young man, I needed help.

45
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:50,860
Try to be more specific Danny.

46
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,320
Why do you think, you feel this way?

47
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:57,480
I guess i'm just curious? You know..

48
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,850
I run my fingers over my face, but...

49
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,499
But that tells me shit about how I look.

50
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,899
And that matters to you, does it?

51
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,690
Sure yeah, of course it does.

52
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:12,990
Even Maria has got these friends,
and they come by. She's 14years old.

53
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,710
You know, these girls freak me out.

54
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:19,170
I wanna know that girls are attracted to me.

55
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:22,230
.. and don't feel just sorry for me,
or give me pitty...

56
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,350
I feel like I'm 12year old,
trapped in a 22year old body, you know?

57
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,330
It's perfect.

58
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:34,990
I am 22 year old blind virgin,
who doesn't know anything about girls.

59
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,699
At least I want to know that I
don't look like some kinda monster.

60
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:39,980
Believe me, Danny.

61
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,580
You don't look like a monster.

62
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,650
Doc, you naked again?

63
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,599
- Sorry, Danny.
- Oh Doc!

64
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,799
You promised, you weren't
gonna do that anymore!

65
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,999
It's Just that.. something... a
little problem. I'm working on it.

66
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,399
Doc, you are the smartest people, I know.
But I think..

67
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:04,399
...you might be crazier than most your patients.
You know that?

68
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,399
Sometimes I just feel this need to break out.
To be free, to be who I really am.

69
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,799
I am sorry Danny, it will never
happen again. I promise.

70
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,540
- You said that last time.
- I know, I know.

71
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,799
And I'll probably say it again.

72
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,499
You're a cook, you know?

73
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,660
But I love you.

74
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,680
So,

75
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,440
where were we?

76
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,910
Ok, so apart from the fact that I got
this problem with women,

77
00:04:28,911 --> 00:04:31,211
I'm handling things pretty well.

78
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,770
- Hi, Danny.
- Hi girls.

79
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,190
So cute.

80
00:04:47,391 --> 00:04:48,591
Danny, Danny!

81
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,280
Come on in,
your father wants to talk to you.

82
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,190
Sit down.

83
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,190
Don't you wanna sit down?

84
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,140
No, what's up?

85
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:09,899
- I'd say go for it, Danny.
- Go for what?

86
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:11,000
It's too dangerous.

87
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:16,899
- How could you do this to me?
- how could I do what to you?

88
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,299
What are you talking about?

89
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:20,799
- But It's Danny's big chance!
- It's out of the question!

90
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,399
Does somebody wanna fill me in
what we're talking about?

91
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,720
- You stay out of it!
- Shut up!

92
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:31,440
Danny, we got a call from a doctor..
ahh doctor...

93
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,999
- what was his name?
- Parkins.

94
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,499
- That wasn't it.
- Yeah, It was, Parkins. - No, it was somethin..

95
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:39,010
- You talked to him on the phone!
- No.. - It's Perkins!

96
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:43,260
A Doctor Perkins, he said you were maybe
gonna volunteer for some

97
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,050
...sort of experimental operation.

98
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,700
Maybe he can make you see?

99
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,799
What's going on here? How come you ever
said nothing?

100
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,899
I didn't say anything because
I hadn't volunteer for anything yet.

101
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,199
- You don't talk to me about these things anymore?
- It's not a big deal.

102
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:58,599
- Yes,this is a very big deal,
what's going on?

103
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:00,099
It's not gonna happen, there are risks!

104
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:01,799
You don't know, there could be problems.

105
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,599
Hey Mom, you wanna let him
make up his mind once in his life?

106
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,899
- Mom, what if he could see?
- Exactly, what if can see?

107
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:10,299
You are a guinea, not a guinea pig!

108
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:11,640
Oh where are you going?
Come back here!

109
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,699
This is exactly why I dont say anything!

110
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:19,699
I don't wanna worry you Ma, I don't wanna give
everybodies hopes up either.

111
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:22,030
I mean,..
I don't wanna go through this yet..

112
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:24,620
Danny, it's your call,

113
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:27,280
Whatever you decide to do...

114
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:30,200
- We're all behind you.
- I know, Iknow. -He?

115
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,330
I am hungry, ma, how about some dinner?

116
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:39,599
*Where I'm going you can't come, *What
I've got to do you can't be any the part of it.

117
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,400
*He's looking at you, kid. *

118
00:06:57,399 --> 00:07:01,499
Hey D!
Yo Danny boy

119
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:10,199
- Jo, What's up?
- Hey man.

120
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:16,030
I've got some balls down the court,
who swe-ne-ga-geng.

121
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:23,880
- So what do you think, we make some bucks?
- Yeah. Let's do it.

122
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,040
Danny, are you nuts! Danny will you...
- Yeooow

123
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:33,099
That's it, I'm convinced,
you are the Batman.

124
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,800
- How's your sonar?
- OK. Lets do it.

125
00:07:34,801 --> 00:07:35,801
- For money?

126
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,350
Hey, you guys.

127
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,199
This is the guy I was telling you about.

128
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:45,270
Llike I said, he wins, you guys gonna pay 5 to 1.
That's only fair.

129
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,699
How's he gonna know where the loop is?

130
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,510
What, are you the handicap police?

131
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:52,160
Take a shot, show 'em.

132
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:59,340
- Ehmm
- Wait it fella, listen. Let's try 2 $

133
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:02,299
- 2$?
- Thats 50$ if he wins.

134
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:04,100
Hey man,
he's blind as a pebble, godness.

135
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,160
Ready? Shoot the ball.

136

Gotta follow voice, good boy.

Oh godness, three times.

141
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,899
That was a net but it's still good.

142
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,470
You guys gotta ache.

143
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,070
Poetry in motion.

144
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,090
Oh yeah, got it all.

You guys loose, pay up.
Here we go

148
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,430
Now we are talking.

149
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:53,790
- What is it? -50 Bucks.
-50 bucks?

150
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,399
You are amazing, you know that right?

151
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,599
Way, this is going to help most
of my tuition fee.

152
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,280
Yeah, looks like a basket-ball scout to me.

153
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:02,799
And how about you,
what's going on with that law-school thing?

154
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,199
- I've got my first class coming up.
- Really? -Yeah!

155
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,940
Ready?
- Of course I am man.

156
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,420
I am here to eat please.

157
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:15,670
Gina said that if you'd ask her out,
that she'd say yes.

158
00:09:15,671 --> 00:09:16,671
Hit me, hit me..

159
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,699
You're so strange. How come you never wanna go out
with one of my friends?

160
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:23,099
- Leave your brother alone.
- Because they're 14 Maria.

161
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,199
Besides, what could these girls offer him?

162
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:27,899
Look,the time of his life ma,
that's what they could offer him.

163
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,999
- Not everyone is like you Lorenzo.
- That's what you think.

164
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,299
At least you're in your own apartment,
you don't bring them here anymore.

165
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:36,799
- Thanks to God.
- See, this is why I love coming over here.

166
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,610
Danny, do you remember that girl?

167
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:39,920
Ass like a coconut?

168
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,199
She is laying in the bathtub, he has no idea
he turns on the water,

169
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,499
She almost has a heart att... OK!
OK!

170
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:48,600
Maria is here!

171
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:50,280
You're right. Sorry..
Maria forgive me.

172
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:53,899
So Danny, can you tell us more about
this operation?

173
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,799
There'll be volounteers much papa,
so what's the hurry?

174
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,999
The doctor said that family is
Important.

175
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,099
- Yeah Mama. It's important to stay out of it.
- To give support.

176
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,899
- Maybe tomorrow we can drive you there?
- No it's alright, Jay's given me a ride.

177
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:06,350
Ohhh, Jay's gotta wheels now,he?

178
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,240
Let go my ears.

179
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,180
Ohh shit!

180
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,980
Danny, what are you doing?!

181
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,540
In which way, man?

182
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:58,399
Man. That's wheels.

183
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,899
- Hey you don't need a ride to make it home?
- Yeah.

184
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:06,710
- Alright buddy, have it going alright?!
- I'll do.

185
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:25,570
*I thought you told mom that
you'll gonna be here watching her... *

186
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,020
Second.

187
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,500
- Are you ok?
- I'm fine.

188
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:34,960
Noooo!

189
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:37,900
Where is Doris?

190
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,450
Hey, where is Doris?

191
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,099
- Look, what do you want, can't you see I'm busy?
- No, I can't see that you're busy

192
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:47,500
Can't you see that I'm fucking blind?

193
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:50,510
He said the B-word!
He said the B-word.

194
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:56,530
- What happened to Doris?
- She's on vacation.

195
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,280
It's too bad, I liked her.

196
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,870
What're you staring at?

197
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:10,280
The signal from the camera
which is mounted on the glasses...

198
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:15,320
.. goes directly to a chip,
which is implanted in the visual cortex of the brain.

199
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:20,299
- So my eyes are not part of the process then?
- Absolutely, the camera bypasses them.

200
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:22,960
But Danny remember. We don't
see with our eyes.

201
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:26,990
We see with our brains.

202
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:27,880
Now,

203
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:30,799
I'd like to tell you that if the
operation is successfull,

204
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,410
.. you would be able to see like
everyone else.

205
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,450
But that's not going to happen.

206
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,790
The best you can hope for...

207
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:39,991
...is a fuzzy black and white image...

208
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:45,030
.. may it'll be good enough to keep
from bumping into things..

209
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,350
.. may be it'll be enough to see your face.

210
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,090
Yea? Oh, thank you..
Yes, please

211
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:57,799
It's doctor Evans. I'd asked her to join us.

212
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,400
I know you know her.
You'll feel comfortable with her

213
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:03,720
She's going to be a vital
member of the team.

214
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:08,930
Doctor Evans.

215
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,660
Ohh, Doctor Perkins.

216
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,890
Amarige.

217
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,310
Yes, Danny that's right.

218
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,210
That's my new set.

219
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:23,090
- Do you like it?
- Yeah.. yeah it suits you.

220
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:26,080
What do you think doc?

221
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,700
It smells good.

222
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:32,999
Doctor Evans is going to be responsible for
putting together the psychological reports..

223
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,110
.. of all the potential candidates
for this operation.

224
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,399
- I'd have no problem with that.
- Good.

225
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:43,280
So all we really need to know,
that if the FDA gives us green light.

226
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:48,270
Can we put you down as
a potential candidate?

227
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,370
Oh, you can take your time, Danny.

228
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:54,600
This is a... very important decision.

229
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,899
- So, do you have someone leading you?

230
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:00,000
- No, I'll get a cab, if you can
put me in the right direction.

231
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:02,480
You know how to get out
of the building,right?

232
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:07,230
Hang to the left, go about 15 paces
you should reach the street...

233
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,499
...and a cab should be waiting there.

234
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,399
- Sounds good. -Ok.
- I can take him Doctor Perkins.

235
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:14,499
- I'm leaving now.
- I think I can manage, Doris.

236
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:15,770
The name is Lisa.

237
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,370
Why doesn't he use his cane?

238
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,910
Because he doesn't think himself as blind.

239
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:35,590
- Good night, Doris.
- Good night, Danny.

240
00:14:51,091 --> 00:14:52,191
Taxi!

241
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,620
Lisa, you're late, they are waiting for
you.

242
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,299
- Arvind is here?
- And Mr. Bhat.

243
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:09,499
I'm sorry, I forgot.

244
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:13,240
I think you shouldn't say that
to your future husband.

245
00:15:13,241 --> 00:15:14,241
Go go go

246
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:18,460
- You are in big trouble.
- Take a hike Ravi,

247
00:15:18,561 --> 00:15:21,161
or I tell them what I found under your bed.

248
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:25,599
- Hey - I'm sorry I'm late.
- It's ok.

249
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,810
I apologize for keeping you waiting.

250
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,270
Why? Do you not speak English?

251
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:35,510
Of course I speak English.

252
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:39,999
I see your daughter does not forward
traditions or respect to elders..

253
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,630
...as well as punctuality.

254
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:45,399
For my daughter, punctuality is
an aspiration..

255
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:48,090
.and respect has to be earned.

256
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,140
Nice pal! That's my computer.

257
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,499
- I'm sorry, I didn't see it.
- Just pick it up and give it to me.

258
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,240
Relax, I'm looking for it.

259
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:11,460
Just give it back.

260
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:16,899
So they know you're blind,
They'd find out sooner or later.

261
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:18,470
It's none of their business.

262
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:22,199
Besides, in fact he was rude.
I should've smacked his face.

263
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,399
- You didn't tell me that he was rude to you.
- Yeah, he was rude.

264
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:29,310
You wanna turn around by now?
I would beat the shit out of him.

265
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:32,220
No, killerman, may be later.

266
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,340
- Is there something in the back?
- Yeah.

267
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,650
Suzie is in the back.

268
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,170
- Suzie? -Suzie
- Who's Suzie?

269
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,740
Ehmm, Danny...
Suzie is a hooker.

270
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:53,499
- And she's in the back with someone?
- Yes she is.

271
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,070
Oh Jesus, what's going on?

272
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,950
Look I haven't got a booking.

273
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,599
I've been running out the
car for my lady friends...

274
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,510
.. and they take care of the business
in the back with their Johns...

275
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,280
...now the Johns, they have to pay an extra 50$
cause thats classified as kinky sex.

276
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:11,130
That extra 50$ goes to the house.

277
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,240
Your's truly.

278
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:19,000
- Hey you wanna go something to eat man?
These soundstracks make me hungry.

279
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,310
- So you gonna through with this surgery
or operation or what? -I don't know.

280
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:29,580
- What do you have to lose?
- Half my brain?

281
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:32,299
- Half your brain? What do you mean?
- I told you,

282
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:34,999
...they have to implant this chip
in my brain.

283
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,110
- This is like brain surgery?
- Yes genius, like brain surgery.

284
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:40,680
You are a slap.

285
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,560
- What 're you doing?
- You're making a mess.

286
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,790
Look at you face!

287
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:53,240
This may have like a significant "oops" factor?

288
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:53,700
What?

289
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:57,320
"oops" we lost your the half of your
childhood memories. Sorry!

290
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:58,620
Exactly.

291
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,480
What's the opposite?

292
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:03,800
Well they said if it works, they set the mother of this
I can get a...

293
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,440
fuzzy, black and white image.

294
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:11,200
No no no, we don't want anything less than
full blure HD colour, you know?

295
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,480
Digital!

296
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,799
- Denver
- It was in Dallas, killed the man in there...

297
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:25,499
And looked still alive.
- Watching him die..

298
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,299
- Excuse me..

299
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:29,640
This gentleman has a favour to ask you.

300
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:31,799
Yes, picture.

301
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:34,350
Oh you wanna take a picture?
Sure, alright.

302
00:18:35,051 --> 00:18:36,351
Here we go. Ready?

303
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:39,840
- Don't press the babes, sweety.
-1,2,3..

304
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,490
- Here we go.
- Thank you. - Thank you.

305
00:18:45,191 --> 00:18:48,691
- Aregato! - Aregato
- Arregatoo!

306
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:58,080
- Thank you!
- Thank you, sweetheart.

307
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:03,770
- Who is your friend?
- Oh, Suzie,

308
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,560
This my brother Danny
- Get out!

309
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:07,230
That's him!

310
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:13,840
- Have you told your brother how hansome he is?
- Not today! -Well tell him!

311
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:15,920
Hey Danny, you're gorgeous.

312
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,690
- Well you are.
- Thank you.

313
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,010
Hey, Danny...

314
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:28,520
.. anytime you wanna go in the back
of your brother's limo with me...

315
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:32,240
.. you just let me know. OK?

316
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:34,690
No charge of course.

317
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,350
- Ok you boys.
- You little sexy thing.

318
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,999
- Have a great night.
- Hey, I'll see you tomorrow.

319
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,290
- I see you!
- Alright.

320
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:51,800
What a woman.

321
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,499
She just made you an offer
you can't refuse.

322
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,200
Oh stop it!

323
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:01,000
Danny, what top top bullshit means?
Watch your step. You know,

324
00:20:01,001 --> 00:20:03,001
we both know you haven't done it!

325
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,270
In your age, it's not natural man!

326
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,600
That could stop to build up all kind of pressure and..

327
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:13,120
.. let's not forget about your prostate.

328
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,300
No, no, no,hold on, hold on.

329
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:19,199
This is why all guys have all those problems!
No sex.

330
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,099
You think having a relationship,
hasn't been on my mind?

331
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:24,200
I'm not talking about a relationship.

332
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,930
I'm talking about sex.

333
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:29,760
You know, Danny,

334
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,900
You do wanna do it with a women? Right?!

335
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,390
Yes, of course I do.

336
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,399
I just had a kind of headaches, you know?

337
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,800
You gave me kind of a heart stop for a second.

338
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,399
Look, you don't understand Larry,
I don't want something cheap..

339
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,400
I'm looking for the real thing.

340
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,960
Fine, so you hook up with one nice girl.

341
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,499
I don't want anything arranged, neither a hooker.

342
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,799
OK, no hookers. I'll find a good girl for you.

343
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:57,799
No I don't think so, we've
been through this before.

344
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:00,940
You know what I think? I think you're scared.

345
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,010
Bullshit!

346
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:05,440
- Credible with a vagina?
- Shut your mouth!

347
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,590
Scared of a vagina!

348
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:13,799
- It's gonna be a real date. You know,
dinner and everything. -Yeah

349
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:16,299
You know, take her back to my placet.

350
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:19,299
If we feel something for eachother,
she wants to do it..

351
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:21,399
Then we'll do it, only if she want's to do it.

352
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:24,080
Yeah yeah Danny, that's how it usually works.

353
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:29,590
Otherwise they arrest you
and charge you with rape.

354
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:31,620
Why you laugh? What?

355
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:38,010
- I was just thinking that It'll be a real blind date!
- After 22 years you just thought of that joke?

356
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,499
Open the window down, please.
You still wearing that cologne?

357
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:45,199
- You don't like that?
- Truly!

358
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,340
You've breaking my balls, you would have liked that!

359
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,490
- So who she is?
- I don't know, Mandy so far.

360
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:57,030
Do you trust Larry? What if she's like a dog?

361
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,130
Ok, It's good.

362
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:10,499
- You look good! I like the hair.
- Oh, what is this now?

363
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,070
- How does he look?
- How do I look?

364
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,699
- You look ike a jackass Danny.
- What? He looks good.

365
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:17,270
- Did you do this?
- Yes.

366
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,300
What?

367
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:20,999
- Let's gonna change that shirt.
- What's wrong with the shirt?

368
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:21,999
Nothings wrong with the shirt!

369
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,399
A lot is wrong with that shirt.

370
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,900
We don't need another Tony Soprano in our house.

371
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:31,699
- Do not say anything bad about Tony Soprano.
- Larry you can leave now.

372
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:34,040
Guys, guys! The shirt, the shirt.
What's wrong?

373
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:37,620
- Larry? - Out!
- I was just trying to help.

374
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:44,799
Larry what is it? What's wrong with it?

375
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:48,299
- Very loud!
- OK, pick another one.

376
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:51,670
Nice shirt! I bought you this shirt.

377
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:52,890
Come on, come one.

378
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,850
- So how do you know her?
- She's a friend of a friend.

379
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,870
- Incredible.
- I'm not done yet Danny.

380
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:07,099
You make a blood-off that she's no dog.
Or I stay.

381
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:08,790
- Are you kiddin me?
- No.

382
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:12,199
- You don't trust me anymore?
- In one word, no.

383
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:15,299
- And why not?
- Are you forgetting Gracia Moreno in 10th grade?

384
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:17,060
- Gorilla Moreno?
- Yeah.

385
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:18,599
Some people thought that girl was hot.

386
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:21,099
She smelled like a shaggy carpet.
You make yours or I stay!

387
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:25,690
- Fine. I make your stupid cut.

388
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,670
- Oh, god that hurts!
- Sharp edge, Larry. -I'm on it.

389
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,399
- A blood-off is when we both cut ourselfs.
- No.

390
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,380
- Yes,it's what it is. -No.
- You cut yourself!

391
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:41,999
- You do it first.
- Do it. -No!

392
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,599
- Cut yourself.
- Are you gonna do?

393
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,099
- No.
- So let's get out of here.

394
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,730
- Fine, fine.

395
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:01,999
Ok, Mandy my pleasure to introduce you
to my brother Danny.

396
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,280
Very nice to meet you.

397
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,270

398
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,670
Oh you poor made it.

00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,330
Please.

400
00:24:23,731 --> 00:24:24,831
Danny!

401
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:42,199
- I'm so sorry!
- No.. -I'm really sorry.

402
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:46,580
- You'll feel much better after we get some food.
- Ok..

403
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:55,550
So you're really blind?

404
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:56,440
Yes.

405
00:25:07,041 --> 00:25:08,041
Here you go!

406
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:17,010
Please, stop crying.
Stop it!

407
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:23,010
You don't.. just think I'm this intelligent born,
I don't know it differently.

408
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,820
Oh, brave.

409
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,399
We will talk about you, how is that?
Tell me something about yourself?

410
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,890
There's not much to talk really, I'm 25 yearsold...

411
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:34,350
...I work as secretary...

412
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:39,870
.. people think I that look like
Meryl Streep...

413
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:47,980
But you never know what Meryl Streep
looks like!

414
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:03,630
I think the next one should not be so sensitive.

415
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:09,900
- Evening.
- Get out of my way, asshole!.

416
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:12,350
Can't you see he's blind?

417
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:16,910
Look what you did? Danny, come here honey
Let me help you.

418
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:22,700
- Alright -Oki, put me down. Put me down.
Put me down!

419
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,070
I can walk.

420
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,290
Just trying to help.

421
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,950
You gonna get the door open bigbutt? Let's go!

422
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,330
Larry, Larry.

423
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:34,099
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

424
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:34,620
Please.

425
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:36,580
Lady's first.

426
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:41,650
- I'm sorry.
- Really, no problem.

427
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,050
Cheers baby.

428
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:45,800
So Danny, tell me..

429
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:49,440
.. your physical guard? Like to do some working-out?

430
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:52,260
- Sure.
- What you press?

431
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:55,199
- 50pounds maybe.
- I like that..

432
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,700
I like a man with sense of humor.

433
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,460
Mummy's gonna help you out.

434
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:19,650
I can eat on my own. It's fine.

435
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:24,180
- Hey, I'm just trying to create some chemistry baby.
- I gotta go to the bathroom.

436
00:27:25,035 --> 00:27:28,740
- I'll take you.
- I can walk.

437
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:37,830
Mama hasn't have action like this for weeks,
I'am hungry, let's go.

438
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:46,470
Danny boy?! Mama is here, Danny?

439
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:47,810
Pick up, pick up, pick up!

440
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,960
You better get your ass here. She's crazy.

441
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,560
Danny, open the door.

442
00:27:54,900 --> 00:28:00,250
- Signora, I must ask you to leave.
- Don't Signora me Pablo.

443
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:07,270
Better hold on to your squirrel,
Before he loses his nuts.

444
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:10,399
Signora, take your time. Can I get you
something to Drink?

445
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,740
- An expresso perhaps?
- Out!

446
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,090
- Oh God, get out of here!
- Have you ever done it in the bathroom Danny?

447
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,830
I just wanna meet a normal woman.

448
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:29,660
*I will tear you out
*... big mama...

449
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,980
I have been looking so forward to this night, that I..

450
00:28:37,381 --> 00:28:39,681
brought a little something along with me as a suprise.

451
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:49,250
Danny, I wanna feel the way that you feel,
I wanna see the things that you see.

452
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:53,060
I wanna be as one with you Danny.
Look!

453
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:57,670
- I have a blindfold, I can see the blackness!
- Larry!

454
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:11,100
- Doris still on vacation?
- You're bright good at this, aren't you?

455
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,550
I've got good instinct.

456
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,540
I will tell him you're here.

457
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:20,360
This is a very big decision Danny.

458
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:23,999
- You're sure you wanna do it?
- Yeah, sure I am.

459
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,999
- That's very brave of you Danny.
- You sound like I'm volounteering for a...

460
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,170
.. suicide mission? Is it?

461
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,490
No, no.

462
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:36,290
What I ment to say was,
neurosurgery is never without risks...

463
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:41,150
- .. and it would be wrong to say otherwise.
- What are the risks?

464
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:43,290
We really don't know.

465
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,350
Help!

466
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:49,940
I.. I think what Doctor Perkins is trying to sayv is that...

467
00:29:49,941 --> 00:29:51,941
.. you're very couriagous...

468
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:56,400
...to try something, that has not been done,
very often.

469
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,150
I can take Mr. Waldesakee to a cab Doctor.
If he wants.

470
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:07,820
Sure.

471
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,180
They told me...

472
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:14,599
.. there's allways risks with brain surgery,
but what the hell, you gotta be brave sometime.

473
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:18,299
Sure you gotta be brave, but it's not so smart
to walk around without a cane.. Step!

474
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:20,410
Thanks Mom.

475
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:23,950
You're welcome. You're in luck, here
is the cab.

476
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:30,099
I gotta confess something,
I don't really need a cab...

477
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:31,720
.. I just kinda wanted to talk.

478
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:35,590
Oh, well, that is very sweet.

479
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:38,310
My brother Larry is gonna pick me up. He uh...

480
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,540
.. runs a Limo Service.

481
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:46,999
- He's not here yet.
- How can you tell?

482
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,599
If he were here, trust me, you'd know it.

483
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:52,160
But when he allready comes,
can we give you a ride?

484
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:55,999
Oh, thanks but I better not, my bus is here..

485
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,350
- .. so I better go.
- Yea. -OK..

486
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:01,530
- Bye. -Ok. See you soon!

487
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,340
- Thanks mom.
- Thank you.

488
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:17,699
If she brings us any more food,
we could open our own restaurant.

489
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:20,999
We don't have to. After we get married,
we're gonna take over this one.

490
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,630
It's all been discussed.

491
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:27,699
- Oh and what else has been discussed?
- That you will run this place..

492
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:32,599
- .. until we start having kids.
- And have you discussed when that's gonna be?

493
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:35,299
The sooner the better. And eh...

494
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:37,165
I think we start practising now.

495
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:41,400
Arvind. What if I don't want to run
this restaurant?

496
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:44,940
What if want to go to Medical School?

497
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:47,800
What?

498
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:53,870
Sorry.

499
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:01,099
The final choice isn't going to be made
on abthomal criteria.

500
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:03,699
It's probably going to be made
on a candidate's personality.

501
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:05,680
His ability to cope with the...

502
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:09,000
...success or failure of the operation.

503
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:17,940
Danny! Do you wanna join me for lunch?
I got to the Park across the road.

504
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:21,690
- I got turkey and cheese
- You have any shrimp?

505
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:24,160
- No.
- Allright.

506
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:34,040
...my brother Larry, when I was a kid,
old me thats a kid supposed to run free, in a park.

507
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:38,730
That's what parks are for.
But he didn't tell me about trees.

508
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,350
I really hate trees. Like a lot.

509
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:46,880
- Can we take a walk?
- Wait a minute.

510
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:48,399
You want me to follow you?

511
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,970
No, you lead. I just give you a shoulder.

512
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:53,050
- Rights
- Lead.

513
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:57,199
- Where are we going?
- Do you like baseball?

514
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,770
- I don't know, I've never been.
- You've never been? -No.

515
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:03,290
You'll love it. It's a beautiful game.

516
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,070
You got the smell of the grass...

517
00:33:06,071 --> 00:33:08,271
.. the sound of the ball when it gets crushed.

518
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:13,399
- There is nothing like it.
- Maybe I should go sometime?

519
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,999
Does Doctor Perkins talk to you about
the operation?

520
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,299
Yeah, he said the final choice will be
based on personality.

521
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:21,799
You're not gonna have a problem there.

522
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:26,190
- I am not so sure about that.
- Danny, I've worked with a lot of visiually impaired people...

523
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:31,020
.. and I can honestly say, I've
never met anyone like you.

524
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:33,699
- What do you mean?
- Well...

525
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:36,440
.. it's this feeling oyu give to other people.

526
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:41,510
- And you don't use your cane..
- I use my cane.

527
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:45,330
- Not always! And that's supid and
dangerous and...

528
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:48,090
...also kind of brave.

529
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:52,799
- You thought about a guide dog?
- Oh yeah, walk dogs.

530
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:55,890
Just got this little problem with dog shit.

531
00:33:56,800 --> 00:34:00,360
I guess what I wanna tell you is, you're ok.

532
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:08,450
Think I'm ok enough that you have dinner with me?

533
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:12,220
OK!

534
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:20,000
- Who are these friends you're going out with?
- Just friends from the hospital mom. Bye!

535
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:28,410
- Thank you.
- Thanks. I mean I like to read..

536
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:33,300
...but I love to watch movies, because movies...

537
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:36,050
.. they don't not describe the trees, the sky..

538
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:40,999
...and the birds and all that stuff, in
movies they just talk.

539
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:41,930
They just talk.

540
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:46,650
And when I hear someones voice,
it tells me so much about people.

541
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:52,830
Like your voice. Your voice tells me that..

542
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:57,640
.. ahh, wait. You have short black hair...

543
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:00,140
.. and..

544
00:35:00,141 --> 00:35:04,641
.. you have these big, beautiful, dark
eyes.

545
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:10,399
- Doctor Perkins could have tell you that.
- No, it's your voice. I'm telling you..

546
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:14,590
And your hair, I can tell it is short,
because I can hear it's rushling around.

547
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:18,250
Altough I did take a chance in your eyes,
but now I know it's true..

548
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:22,340
.. they are big and beautiful.

549
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:29,499
I'll figure a lawyer, you now has got to
read people's minds..

550
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:32,920
.. and when you're blind that's
mostly what you do.

551
00:35:32,955 --> 00:35:36,340
- And are you reading my mind?
- Yes, sure. -And?

552
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,670
I can tell that you wanna be here...

553
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:45,650
.. but there's also something
holding you back..

554
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,340
.. and I don't know what this is.

555
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:52,830
I think you're gonna be a very good lawyer.

556
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:56,370
What I'd really like to do is...

557
00:35:56,371 --> 00:35:57,371
.. go to medical school.

558
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:02,399
And then join Doctor Perkins' research team.

559
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:06,010
- Why don't you?
- It's not that simple.

560
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:09,110
- I am a woman.
- I noticed.

561
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:16,599
And one day I'd like to get married
have a family..

562
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:19,340
- Can't you do both?
- No.

563
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:23,550
Not without an understanding husband.

564
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:29,510
So you just gonna have to choose
the right one.

565
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:43,960
- That is one fine lady Mr. Waldesakee.
- Thank you, James.

566
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:52,410
I can smell when Mrs. Luciano makes
fettucini food 3 blocks away...

567
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:55,760
.. or they cut grass on the baseball field...

568
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:57,710
.. I love your perfume..

569
00:36:58,300 --> 00:36:59,580
.. and your smile.

570
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,199
You smell that the blossoms
are out earlier this year!?

571
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,010
Now you show out.

572
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:12,860
- Is anybody else around?
- No, we are alone.

573
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:15,970
I had the best night I've ever had.

574
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,499
I just hope it's been half as good for you.

575
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:21,020
I've had a wonderful time.

576
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,110
Alright, thanks.

577
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,560
An oil leak now.

578
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:59,590
So will you tell me about it?

579
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:02,699
She is the most natural person on the whole world.

580
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:04,970
She's got the most beautiful smile.

581
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,760
How do you know, what her smile looks like?

582
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:11,910
You don't understand, It's the sound of it.

583
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:14,820
I love the sound of her smile.

584
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,800
So why did you not take her back
to my place last night?

585
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:20,550
Look it's not everything coming down to sex.

586
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:24,360
That's true, money and looks are
important too.

587
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:28,890
Hey Mike. Don't forget to clean
those footprints of my ceiling.

588
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:31,860
- Unbelievable.
- What's so unbelievable?

589
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:33,960
- Your face.
- It's hot.

590
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:54,650
- Hi!
- Hey.

591
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,270
They're gorgeous, thank you.

592
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:07,760
- Do you like Humphrey Bogart?
- I like Humphrey Bogart.

593
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:10,960
Let's go, kid.

594
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:15,880
*- And what about us?
*- Always have Paris.

595
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:19,399
*We lost him, until you
came to Casablanca?*

596
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,800
*We got him back last night*

597
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,899
*I said I would never leave you. *

598
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:26,299
*You never will. *

599
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:28,280
*I gotta job to do too. *

600
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:34,870
- Danny, I've gotto go.
- No, don't go.

601
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:45,270
Lisa, I never felt this way for any
other woman before.

602
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:09,350
- I'll see you soon, ok?
- Yeah.

603
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,210
- Bye.
- Bye!

604
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:44,599
Arvind will take over the business in
a few years, when I retire.

605
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:49,099
And with a loyal wife by his side,
he will be well able to provide for his family.

606
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:54,299
Arvinds I believe will provide for his future family are
no doubt because he's Indian.

607
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:58,970
And there should be no doubt of the
loyalty of his future wife either.

608
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:05,599
I want to tell you how proud we are
all of you Danny.

609
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:08,760
First for getting chosen for
this operation, and..

610
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,390
.. second, for having pale to go through it.

611
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:17,370
- What does "pale" mean?
- Balls! -Stop corrupting me common, please.

612
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:21,199
Thank you, pop. Thank you, Larry.
I would just like to say that..

613
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:22,710
...If this thing does workout...

614
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:27,660
.. and I can see your faces for the first time..

615
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:32,050
.. and I find out that you're all too ugly,
I'm moving out! -Heyyy

616
00:41:32,051 --> 00:41:33,051
- Chinchin
- Salut -salut -salut!

617
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:40,140
Doctor Perkins says if it's succesfull..

618
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:43,310
.. I might be able to see enough to..

619
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:46,190
.. get around, even identify faces.

620
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:50,400
I might be able to see your face.

621
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,310
And know what you look like.

622
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:03,410
Only a man can cause joy one day
and tears the next.

623
00:42:03,711 --> 00:42:05,411
What has Arvind done?

624
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:07,660
Mom it isn't not Arvind.

625
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:12,820
- Is he Hindu?
- He's not Indian.

626
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:22,199
A few years after I came to this
country, I met this man.

627
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:25,930
An american. He was very handsome
like a moviestar.

628
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,020
Everytime I saw him
my heart jumped.

629
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:33,460
- Mom, what happened?
- He met a beautiful American girl.

630
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:39,099
Nothing to be sad about,
just thankful.

631
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:41,420
I met your father just after that.

632
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:50,340
You are my only daughter, and
I love you very much.

633
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:53,750
But, you made a promise to Arvind.

634
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:59,660
And only you can decide, if
you can honor that promise or not.

635
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:12,999
I'm sorry, I should have told you earlier.

636
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,999
- What are you talking? What does
that suppose to mean?

637
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:18,500
- Danny, I've had a wonderful time with you..

638
00:43:18,535 --> 00:43:18,960
and...

639
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:23,780
.. no one's ever made me feel this way..

640
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:25,500
.. but I'm engaged to be married.

641
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:27,880
Engaged to be married?

642
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:32,230
What is that supposed to mean?

643
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:36,130
It means I can't see you anymore.

644
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:40,880
Am I missing something here?!
I don't understand.

645
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:45,180
I'm sorry. I've should have told you earlier.

646
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,800
Do you love this guy?

647
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:51,120
Do you!?!

648
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,599
- He's a nice guy Danny.
- That doen'tanswer my question!

649
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:58,199
- Do you love him?
- It's not that simple!

650
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:00,060
There's a lot more to it than that!

651
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:03,650
Just be honest with me.

652
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:08,199
At the end of the day, you'd rather
be with someone who can see..

653
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:10,060
.. instead of some asshole blind guy.

654
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:24,280
Danny, I know what it's like to get dumped.
I understand.

655
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:29,550
What you've got to do is look at it like
you're one of the ten guys. OK?

656
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:32,710
For every 10 "no"'s that you get
you gonna get 1 "yes", ok? So..

657
00:44:34,700 --> 00:44:37,840
.. this "no" is really just bringing you
that much closer to a "yes".

658
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:41,490
Trust me on this Danny,
It's all mathematics.

659
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:47,650
Ready, set, pitch! Wow!

660
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:52,210
Elbony double for sure.

661
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:55,110
I smell money man..

662
00:44:55,211 --> 00:44:56,511
- Hey, hey hey.
- What's up?

663
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:00,480
It doesn't bother you? That I can't see,

664
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:01,540
No!

665
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:04,899
Even when we were at school
and you helped me all the time?

666
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:08,220
Ohh, wait a second.
It's those girls you've been dating?

667
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:11,450
- I just don't get it man!
- Look Danny boy..

668
00:45:11,551 --> 00:45:13,551
Girls are something you can
not figure out. Alright?

669
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:18,299
But if they can't realize that you're a good guy

You're high man, common, next pitch.

00:45:45,211 --> 00:45:46,211

00:45:46,300 --> 00:45:50,799
You look so beautiful tonight
I just wanted a little bit of time alone with you.

676
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:53,250
They are crying up to me all night, "Alvind"...

677
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:57,630

686
00:46:27,100 --> 00:46:28,430

Very very impressive.

- Hey Danny, let's go.
To the showers. -Yeah

697
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:14,199
Alright, pick something cool.
Think James Dean.

698
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:16,060
Did you mess up my hair?

699
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:17,600
Looks fine.

700
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:21,970
So, who'd Larry fix you up with this time?

701
00:47:22,499 --> 00:47:24,299
- Pick it up, thank you...

702
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:48,380
So, Larry tells me you're in the service
industry, that's correct? What do you do exactly?

703
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:51,690
Service industry, I like that.

704
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:54,200
It's a good one.

705
00:47:58,900 --> 00:47:59,930
This is Dolores.

706
00:48:02,100 --> 00:48:05,440
Yes, its $500. Not including healthfare.

707
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:06,860
Call me like, hmm...

708
00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:09,650
Two hours.

709
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:16,280
- No, I don't do seniors.
- Ohh Come on!

710
00:48:18,100 --> 00:48:20,730
.. she was cute, we had a good time.

711
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:21,360
Larry...

712
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,320
Where is Dolores?

713
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:28,410
What did I say! What did I say?!

714
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:30,060
No hookers, right!?

715
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:32,870

00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:39,670
- Larry, are you alright?
- No. - Get in the car Larry.

717
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:41,910
You dont touch like a... Bitch.

718
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:44,850
Get in the car and stop
bleeding you pussy.

719
00:48:46,100 --> 00:48:48,860
Danny, I was hopin' to kinda help you.

720
00:48:50,100 --> 00:48:53,300
And I figured maybe, you know,
you could use a little push

721
00:48:56,300 --> 00:48:59,999
There's one other girl I was thinking
about setting you up with.

722
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:01,470
And this girl...

723
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:06,190
She's a real bomb-shop man,
new client of mine.

724
00:49:06,300 --> 00:49:08,040
- Top class actually.
- No.

725
00:49:09,100 --> 00:49:11,090
- Fine - Fine
- Fine - Fine - Fine

726
00:49:16,100 --> 00:49:18,030
- She's top class?
- As I said.

727
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:21,730
- Alright, but under one condition.
- What?

728
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:25,099
- She can't know I'm blind.
- Are you nuts?

729
00:49:25,100 --> 00:49:28,099
Too risky man. I don't see the point in it.

730
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:31,740
You don't see the point?
The point is crystal-clear. - Alright

731
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:36,199
I made sure the dates, they weren't dating me,
they were dating some blind guy.

732
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:39,099
- I don't want their pitty.
- You're saying you don't won't it sympathily?

733
00:49:39,100 --> 00:49:39,860
Tissue.

734
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:43,470
At least you are on the right track.

735
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:46,799
How do you think you
pull this on? he?

736
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:48,150
Easy.

737
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:59,720
- Step there!
- I know the step.

738
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,399
Hold on, tell me what's to your left?

739
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:02,970
Thank you, Larry.

740
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:08,060

Well done.

749
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,980
- To loud, not to loud.
- That's good right?

750
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:11,550
This is a 6 CD changer, reset
this button here, it changes the CD.

751
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:15,520
Just be careful.

752
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:18,710
That's FM radio Danny!

753
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:26,770
No no no. Don't push anthing else.
All you gotta do is push "play".

754
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:28,970
Very careful.

755
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:32,130
This is not funny.

756
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:35,390
Alright Danny, look. Now..

757
00:51:38,300 --> 00:51:41,930
If you ever get this far, you will
gonna need one of these.

758
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:45,750
That's a condom. It's for safe sex.

759
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,999
- Is there any worse than a bling guy
who'd gender the woods? -squiggly.

760
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,040
Yes Daniel. It is squiggly.

761
00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:56,299
This is what you have to to on your own.
I can not help you with this.

762
00:51:56,300 --> 00:51:58,100
But think of it like homework.

763
00:51:58,200 --> 00:51:59,990
Not now.

764
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:02,810
You like that condom, don't you?

765
00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:04,940
Larry, no one fit.

766
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:11,910
- They are to big, they keep on falling off!
- That's impossible Danny, you are a Waldesakee.

767
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:16,780
- I tried for at last 2 hours.
- You stayed up for two hours?

768
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:20,899
- What do youmean "up"?
- Daniel you can't put the condom on unless you..

769
00:52:20,900 --> 00:52:21,880
"stiff" you know?

770
00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:24,740
You haven't told me that!

771
00:52:27,100 --> 00:52:30,780
- Danny, what is that?
- I'm swallowing and will se if one fit.

772
00:52:31,700 --> 00:52:33,150
Are you chewing on the condoms?

773
00:52:34,700 --> 00:52:35,870
They taste like haven man.

774
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:40,230
What 're you putting me on here? You know
I'm busy right now?

775
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:52,199
Good evening, Mr. Waldesakee.

780
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:11,610
- Yes, where is Pedro?
- He's out. Little dray for flours...

781
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:17,950
- What was the name on the reservation?
- Waldesakee.

782
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:20,960
Right, this way.

783
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:41,760
Excusi signore!
Your table is this way.

784
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:46,810
- Corner table right?
- No, as you an see, this table is occupied.

785
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:55,670

00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:03,780
Yes Sir?

787
00:54:04,300 --> 00:54:09,450
- I wished corner table with Piedro.
- He did not tell me.

788
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,160
Please this way.

789
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:20,910
Sir, is everything alright?

790
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,680
- Tell me. How far is the table from here?
- I beg your pardon?

791
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:29,220
Listen, carefully. From where I'm standing now,
how many steps to the table?

792
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:32,580
I'd say about 20.

793
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:35,599
In which direction, clockwise?

794
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:39,880
- In 9 o'clock.
- Anything in the way? -No!

795
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:45,099
Now! You're gonna walk in front of me,
walk slowly.

796
00:54:45,100 --> 00:54:47,080
- Keep on talking!
- I don't know what's going on...

797
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:56,199
- Tell me you're stopping!
- I did not know!

798
00:54:57,700 --> 00:54:59,740
It won't happen again.

799
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:02,720
This way Sir. You table.

800
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:07,099
- What took you so long?
- I was just saying hi to some friends..

00:55:07,100 --> 00:55:07,910
.from Japan.

802
00:55:08,900 --> 00:55:10,580
This is my good side.

803
00:55:14,300 --> 00:55:16,399
You want some wine,
I would like some wine!

804
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:18,100

809
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:05,240
Danny, you have some chocolate sauce
on your chin.

810
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:11,110
You're not very good at your job
cleaning that up. Let me.

811
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:20,999
You're so different from the other men
I date.

812
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:22,620
You're just like a little boy.

813
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:27,050
You know, what I like most about you?

814
00:56:27,100 --> 00:56:29,940
Your eyes. And the way you look at me.

815
00:56:32,700 --> 00:56:34,790

- Who needs ice cream, when
you've got desert? - Yes.

820
00:57:20,900 --> 00:57:22,300

832
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:19,899
*.. do yu like what you see?
Yeah, you do... *

833
00:58:19,900 --> 00:58:22,950
- Never seen better.
- Yeah, baby!

834
00:58:29,500 --> 00:58:32,810
Now you like what you see,
now like me see,right?

835
00:58:33,100 --> 00:58:34,020
You like it?

836
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:39,270
You certainly like it!

837
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:40,750
Now let's see...

838
00:58:43,500 --> 00:58:45,010
...the desire?

839
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:53,840
I knew something is wrong.
Why didn't you tell me?

840
00:58:55,300 --> 00:58:58,399
No, no, look. I just thought that may be
I could go out with someone..

841
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:01,299
Who didn't first have to come with the
terms with the fact that am blind.

842
00:59:01,300 --> 00:59:01,760
Blind!

843
00:59:03,700 --> 00:59:05,380
I thought that you're gay!

844
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:05,499
*Mrs. Waldesakee, if Danny
misses any more tests,*

845
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:07,600
*we won't be able to proceed
with the operation*

846
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,160
Thank you for calling, Doctor.

847
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:23,930
Mama relax, I'll find him. OK?

848
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:31,560
Let's play some balls.

849
01:00:32,900 --> 01:00:36,260
- You're OK boss?
- Yep!

850
01:00:36,561 --> 01:00:37,661
- Check it out.

851
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:41,699
Blind guys shoot first,
you understand?

852
01:00:41,700 --> 01:00:43,599
- How do I know he's blind?
- Because you...

853
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:45,360
.. low boy, all the
world knows he's blind.

854
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:47,820
- And what are you, an eye
specialist or something?

855
01:00:47,921 --> 01:00:49,321
- What are you talking about boy?

856
01:00:58,500 --> 01:00:59,630
Give me that!

857
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:02,470
Hej, J! You smell that?

858
01:01:02,571 --> 01:01:04,571
- Smells like ass man!
- What!?

859
01:01:05,700 --> 01:01:06,710
Hey! Big man!

860
01:01:08,900 --> 01:01:13,160
- Like into blind kid?

861
01:01:19,300 --> 01:01:20,750
Endow him, Larry.

862
01:01:21,651 --> 01:01:23,151
Let it go! Let go!

863
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:32,110
Why haven't you going to the Doctor?

864
01:01:40,100 --> 01:01:42,290
Danny, just tell me what
the problem is..

865
01:01:42,391 --> 01:01:44,191
.. I promise you, It's not as bad
as you think.

866
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:48,900
I don't understand you anymore man.

867
01:01:49,300 --> 01:01:53,199
This operation is something for you,
You understand that?

868
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:55,350
It's gonna make you life better.

869
01:01:57,200 --> 01:01:58,700
Why would you wanna ruin that?

870
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:05,270
I'm gonna be right by the car,
making calls.

871
01:02:05,271 --> 01:02:06,871
If you need me right?

872
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:20,100
- Danny, hi.
- Hi.

873
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:36,310
- I'ill tell Doctor Perkins you're here.
- Yeah, do that, just...

874
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:39,200
.. tell him I'm here.
Because I'm here.

875
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:47,500
Danny, I need to know that you still
feel positive about this operation.

876
01:02:48,900 --> 01:02:50,050
I tell you what..

877
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,390
Why don't you see Doctor Evans
one more time...

878
01:02:53,700 --> 01:02:56,200
She give's us her assessment,
we take it from there?

879
01:03:05,600 --> 01:03:06,590
Danny, wait.

880
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:08,700
Look, can we go to the park
and talk?

881
01:03:09,300 --> 01:03:10,899
- I never really explain
myself too well.

882
01:03:10,900 --> 01:03:12,370
What's to explain?
You're getting married!

883
01:03:13,600 --> 01:03:14,590
Danny, please.

884
01:03:17,191 --> 01:03:17,991
Danny..

885
01:03:20,100 --> 01:03:21,090
Danny, please.

886
01:03:48,100 --> 01:03:51,599
Danny, there is something else
I should have told you before.

887
01:03:51,600 --> 01:03:54,160
- Oh Jesus, You're carrying his child?
- No!

888
01:03:55,100 --> 01:03:57,190
I haven't even slept with him.

889
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,160
I haven't slept with anyone, ever!

890
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:01,610
Join the club!

891
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:04,160
Danny, I'm Indian.

892
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:07,999
It's hard to explain..

893
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:09,900
...what that means, to someone,
who isn't Indian.

894
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:12,340
It's a different world.

895
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:14,660
It's a different culture.

896
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:18,940
- This guy is Indian too, right?
- Yes, he is.

897
01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:23,630
When I asked you if you'd love him
you couldn't answer me.

898
01:04:25,100 --> 01:04:29,780
My family's concept of love
isn't what you think it is.

899
01:04:29,800 --> 01:04:31,230
- It's gotta do with duty..

900
01:04:31,231 --> 01:04:32,831
...and loyalty and responsibility..
- To who?

901
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:38,410
Danny. I can't go against my family.

902
01:04:43,300 --> 01:04:46,340
I can't break a promise I'd made.

903
01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:49,670
I'm sorry.

904
01:04:52,900 --> 01:04:56,690
And It's got nothing to do
with you beeing blind.

905
01:04:58,500 --> 01:04:59,250
Who knows..

906
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:02,060
.. when you can see..

907
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:06,720
.. you might not like me anyway.

908
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:11,030
I'm not an american beauty.

909
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:20,750
I've gotta go.

910
01:05:31,300 --> 01:05:34,360
- Did I do something wrong?
- No Danny

911
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:37,299
Falling in love with someone, who
is really engaged is not a crime.

912
01:05:37,300 --> 01:05:39,530
But it's a crime for her falling
in love with me?

913
01:05:39,531 --> 01:05:41,031
Is that what it is?

914
01:05:41,100 --> 01:05:43,610
No, falling in love is completely
natural.

915
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:46,740
I mean, we even don't have
control over it.

916
01:05:47,300 --> 01:05:51,099
- Then maybe it's like men slaughter?
- I don't understand?

917
01:05:51,100 --> 01:05:54,050
- When you do something,
and you don't really mean it.

918
01:05:54,051 --> 01:05:55,151
No.

919
01:05:56,100 --> 01:05:57,850
No falling in love is..

920
01:05:58,251 --> 01:06:00,651
.. is the most beautiful thing in the
whole world!

921
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:03,540
Yes.

922
01:06:06,700 --> 01:06:07,970
Yeah I guess so.

923
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,270
- Are you naked today Doc?
- No.

924
01:06:16,300 --> 01:06:17,920
No, but I'd like to be.

925
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:23,799
- Doctor Sato, we can do this.
- I think it's impossible,

926
01:06:23,800 --> 01:06:26,199
He's missed too many tests,
he's obviously not comitted.

927
01:06:26,200 --> 01:06:28,699
We have enough time to finish
those tests before the operation,

928
01:06:28,700 --> 01:06:30,400
I promise you this boy is comitted.

929
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:32,780
Most of us live our lifes..

930
01:06:32,781 --> 01:06:33,781
.. viewing it from the outside-in.

931
01:06:36,900 --> 01:06:38,890
Danny experiences his world
from the inside-out.

932
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:42,820
And that's his strenght.

933
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:46,899
He is more than capable of dealing
traumatic change.

934
01:06:46,900 --> 01:06:49,400
And with coping with the
outcome of operation,

935
01:06:49,401 --> 01:06:50,401
whatever that may be.

936
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:10,180
- I'm here, if you need me.
- Thank you.

937
01:07:16,100 --> 01:07:16,500
What?

938
01:07:20,500 --> 01:07:22,990
Is my baby gonna be alright?

939
01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:24,440
He's going to be just fine.

940
01:07:29,600 --> 01:07:32,399
'Cause if anything should happen to him
there's gonna be a lot of shouting.

941
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:33,610
Down here and in heaven.

942
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:38,650
You are a good mother.

943
01:07:38,900 --> 01:07:40,230
And you gotta good boy.

944
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:42,940
Nothing's gonna happen to.

945
01:07:43,800 --> 01:07:45,720
No one's gonna have to shout.

946
01:07:54,900 --> 01:07:55,770
Yes..

947
01:07:58,500 --> 01:08:00,590
I'll be there like 9:30.

948
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:02,460
Ready.

949
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:10,650
- The lead?
- Ready.

950
01:08:17,100 --> 01:08:18,970
*Activities normal*

951
01:08:22,800 --> 01:08:24,430
*All readings stable*

952
01:08:37,500 --> 01:08:38,960
*Automatic pressure up*

953
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,710
Mr. Waldesakee. Excuse me..

954
01:08:52,600 --> 01:08:54,760
Danny came through surgery
beautifully.

955
01:08:54,761 --> 01:08:56,561
He's doing very very well.

956
01:08:57,100 --> 01:08:58,899
- So when can we see him?
- When he wake's up.

957
01:08:59,200 --> 01:09:00,165
And we start our tests..

958
01:09:00,200 --> 01:09:02,290
.. as soon as he's strong enough.

959
01:09:39,700 --> 01:09:41,900
- How are you?
- Let's do this. -Alright.

960
01:09:44,100 --> 01:09:46,200
You're going to feel a little pressure.

961
01:09:50,800 --> 01:09:52,660
- You all right?
- Fine.

962
01:09:56,600 --> 01:09:57,940
I'm putting on the glasses.

963
01:09:59,100 --> 01:10:00,299
And when the time is right..

964
01:10:00,300 --> 01:10:02,100
.. take all the time you need..

965
01:10:03,200 --> 01:10:05,480
I'm going to turn on the power,
to the camera.

966
01:10:05,900 --> 01:10:07,290
You let me know.

967
01:10:09,200 --> 01:10:10,830
- I'm ready.
- Good man.

968
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:14,380
We're gonna do this on
the count of 3. Alright?

969
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:16,200
One.

970
01:10:16,700 --> 01:10:17,240
Two.

971
01:10:17,700 --> 01:10:18,460
And three.

972
01:10:21,200 --> 01:10:22,420
Right, tell me what's happening.

973
01:10:23,521 --> 01:10:26,321
- What's happening?
- What is it Danny?

974
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:27,500
Hurts a little bit.

975
01:10:31,899 --> 01:10:33,099
There is some...

976
01:10:35,400 --> 01:10:37,480
There's... There's something here there.

977
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:39,070
- Things...
- Things?

978
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:42,240
Probably fuzz leads..

979
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,750
This is an indication that the visiual
cortex is beeing simulated.

980
01:10:47,200 --> 01:10:49,410
It's not all black anymore, it's...

981
01:10:51,500 --> 01:10:52,310
Is there...

982
01:10:54,200 --> 01:10:56,090
Something here like a...

983
01:10:57,200 --> 01:10:58,010
.. square,

984
01:10:59,700 --> 01:11:02,000
Square? Danny, that's a window!

985
01:11:04,300 --> 01:11:06,410
- Something moved! something moved.
- That's me!

986
01:11:06,900 --> 01:11:09,460
That's me, you saw me in front
of the window!

987
01:11:16,100 --> 01:11:17,850
It's a good start.

988
01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:21,799
It is like a older person...

989
01:11:21,800 --> 01:11:24,300
- Let's get you out.
- Well done.

990
01:11:31,700 --> 01:11:34,320
- You OK?
- Yes, yes.

991
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:05,690
- Hi baby.
- Mom.

992
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:21,440
Guess who.

993
01:12:43,200 --> 01:12:45,360
What's up ugly?

994
01:13:09,300 --> 01:13:13,150
- Where is Jay?
- I'm here, man.

995
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:16,610
You rock, man.

996
01:13:17,511 --> 01:13:18,611
I am proud of you, man.

997
01:13:28,300 --> 01:13:30,270
I am so proud of you, Danny.

998
01:13:33,800 --> 01:13:34,670
Guess it works.

999
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:36,710
This is Tweet,yeah.

1000
01:13:45,100 --> 01:13:49,399
*Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow*
*But soon, and for the rest of your life. *

1001
01:13:49,400 --> 01:13:50,790
*What about us?*

1002
01:13:51,900 --> 01:13:53,300
*We'll always have Paris. *

1003
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:54,650
- Danny
- Yes?

1004
01:13:58,200 --> 01:14:00,180
- You're OK?
- Yea.

1005
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,220
Common, I wanna show you something.

1006
01:14:15,700 --> 01:14:16,390
It's you.

1007
01:14:25,491 --> 01:14:26,491
Danny?

1008
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:28,520
Mom!

1009
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:32,740
Alright.

1010
01:14:33,800 --> 01:14:34,660
That's alright.

1011
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:36,590
Good construction.
It's good.

1012
01:14:37,100 --> 01:14:39,950
- Shoulders to your ears.
- Fine

1013
01:14:46,900 --> 01:14:47,360
Lisa.

1014
01:14:50,600 --> 01:14:53,340
- It doesn't sound Indian.
- No.

1015
01:14:54,200 --> 01:14:55,360
You really like her? Don't you?

1016
01:15:00,200 --> 01:15:01,480
You're in love with her!

1017
01:15:02,600 --> 01:15:02,940
Yeah.

1018
01:15:04,300 --> 01:15:07,050
- Guess though.
- Have you told her?

1019
01:15:07,300 --> 01:15:09,460
No, I haven't got a chance.

1020
01:15:12,700 --> 01:15:14,630
This is the date chosen by the
astrologer..

1021
01:15:14,631 --> 01:15:16,831
as the most auspicous day
for the wedding.

1022
01:15:17,200 --> 01:15:20,399
- To avoid any calamity.
- Are you agreed with that?

1023
01:15:20,400 --> 01:15:24,010
Sure. The 28th is a as good
a date as any.

1024
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:33,850
*It's a new procedure*
*Everyone had to learn this.. *

1025
01:15:35,500 --> 01:15:38,040
*But remember, you and I wouldn't be*
*standing here talking*

1026
01:15:38,041 --> 01:15:39,941
*right now, If it wasn't for*
*a brave man like Danny*

1027
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:43,499
*Who take on the risks*
*of experimental surgerie*

1028
01:15:43,500 --> 01:15:45,300
* and paid the way for*
*all those who follow*

1029
01:15:45,700 --> 01:15:47,510
- Is there a camera here?
- Yea.

1030
01:15:48,100 --> 01:15:50,699
Close in thight, I smell an Emmy.

1031
01:15:50,700 --> 01:15:53,499
Hi Danny, thanks for taking an
interview today.

1032
01:15:53,500 --> 01:15:55,890
How you doing?
Danny, why don't you..

1033
01:15:55,891 --> 01:15:56,891
.. take a walk down the street..

1034
01:15:57,300 --> 01:15:58,899
.. and throw a ball or something?
- Yeah, ehmm

1035
01:15:59,400 --> 01:16:01,099
- I've that tried out for...
- Ohh no no no.

1036
01:16:01,100 --> 01:16:03,999
Ok stop, you're not gonna do any action
until not without a contract.

1037
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,620
- Ok people?
- I'm sorry, who are you?

1038
01:16:07,300 --> 01:16:11,199
I'm Lorenzo Waldesakee. I'm his
brother and his manager and..

1039
01:16:11,200 --> 01:16:13,999
...and I run "Lorenzo's Limos" and...

1040
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:15,900
.. if any of you people wants
the ride of a lifetime..

1041
01:16:16,200 --> 01:16:17,660
...just call Lorenzo...

1042
01:16:21,100 --> 01:16:22,320
Call an ambulance!

1043
01:16:23,700 --> 01:16:25,199
*We gave it our best shot..

1044
01:16:25,200 --> 01:16:26,800
...but it's obviously effecting
his brain and...

1045
01:16:27,100 --> 01:16:28,510
...we can't take any chances.

1046
01:16:29,300 --> 01:16:31,899
*So the prosthesis must come out
first thing tomorrow*

1047
01:16:32,200 --> 01:16:34,200
Now, there is a chance..

1048
01:16:34,201 --> 01:16:36,201
.. that the prosthesis might have moved.

1049
01:16:36,600 --> 01:16:38,799
- So Danny must lie very still.

1050
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:40,700
- And he must not use these
glasses anymore.

1051
01:16:41,400 --> 01:16:43,699
*Hi Danny, thanks for taking our interview. *

1052
01:16:43,700 --> 01:16:45,920
Lisa, the Bacha gonna be
here any minute.

1053
01:16:46,621 --> 01:16:47,921
Lisa?! Lisa!

1054
01:16:53,200 --> 01:16:54,420
*call an ambulance!*

1055
01:17:05,300 --> 01:17:06,330
Danny how you doing?

1056
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:08,870
Not good.

1057
01:17:14,200 --> 01:17:16,400
- Got another headache?

1058
01:17:16,401 --> 01:17:18,901
- It's another one or the same one
that hasn't gone away.

1059
01:17:20,100 --> 01:17:23,420
It's gonna be just a headache
for the operation, ain't it?

1060
01:17:24,400 --> 01:17:25,670
It's a girl!?

1061
01:17:27,400 --> 01:17:30,400
I tought that I'd be so busy
seeing the world..

1062
01:17:30,601 --> 01:17:32,201
.. you know, that
I forget about her?

1063
01:17:34,700 --> 01:17:38,310
.. but I just can't get her out
of my mind pap.

1064
01:17:41,100 --> 01:17:42,260
That what Mimi sings in "La Boheme"

1065
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:45,570
"Love only you alone guide us"

1066
01:17:47,700 --> 01:17:50,399
I guess you just gonna give
it some time.

1067
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:52,780
- How much time?
- Don't ask me.

1068
01:17:53,500 --> 01:17:55,700
I only ever loved your mother,..

1069
01:17:55,801 --> 01:17:57,701
.. would've waited a 1000 years for her.

1070
01:18:01,200 --> 01:18:02,010
To family!

1071
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:25,130
Hope it fits.

1072
01:18:51,800 --> 01:18:55,440
*This is "Lorenzo's Limos"*
*Best limo service in town. *

1073
01:19:10,300 --> 01:19:12,170
Doctor Perkins, this is Lisa.

1074
01:19:27,100 --> 01:19:29,120
When is the next bus to
north central?

1075
01:19:29,121 --> 01:19:30,521
You're looking at it.

1076
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,690
I'm sorry, but I had some
bad news about a friend.

1077
01:19:53,400 --> 01:19:56,399
Well we mustn't intend to
stop the festivities.

1078
01:19:56,400 --> 01:19:59,500
To wonderful food and
beautiful people.

1079
01:20:18,400 --> 01:20:21,040
Buddy, we're here. Welcome to
downtown north central.

1080
01:20:23,400 --> 01:20:25,299
Do you know where the

01:20:25,400 --> 01:20:27,199
- Oh, never heard. Which
street is it? -Lowstreet.

1085
01:20:33,300 --> 01:20:35,000
- Ok, thank you.
- Watch your step!

1086
01:21:24,900 --> 01:21:27,990
- What's the matter with you kid?

1087
01:21:28,400 --> 01:21:30,770

01:21:35,100 --> 01:21:37,000
- Somethings gonna be wrong

1092
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:32,799
- Is this the Crimson Elephant?
- Yes it is.

1093
01:22:33,200 --> 01:22:35,580
- Is Lisa here?
- She's right there.

1094
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,199
- Are you OK?
- Can I help you?

1095
01:22:42,200 --> 01:22:44,599
- I need to see Lisa.
- Danny?

1096
01:22:44,600 --> 01:22:46,390
Do you know this of man?

1097
01:22:48,391 --> 01:22:49,291
Danny?!

1098
01:22:51,192 --> 01:22:51,892
Danny?!

1099
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:54,530
You're not supposed to be here.

1100
01:22:54,531 --> 01:22:55,531
- I had to see you..

1101
01:22:55,532 --> 01:22:57,532
.. it's my last chance to see you!
But..

1102
01:23:00,200 --> 01:23:02,920
.. it's not good working anyway.

1103
01:23:03,700 --> 01:23:04,750
It doesn't matter, because..

1104
01:23:07,100 --> 01:23:08,290
I've already seen you..

1105
01:23:08,391 --> 01:23:10,791
I've seen your face,
I've seen your eyes, I've seen..

1106
01:23:10,792 --> 01:23:13,192
.. your lips, your hair

1107
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
I've seen everything in you..

1108
01:23:16,001 --> 01:23:17,201
.. are beautiful.

1109
01:23:19,800 --> 01:23:21,120
- This is not good.
- Shhh!

1110
01:23:23,900 --> 01:23:26,210
You remember when you
tried to tell me what..

1111
01:23:26,211 --> 01:23:27,411
your family thought about love?

1112
01:23:29,200 --> 01:23:32,160
Let me tell, what I think about love.

1113
01:23:33,400 --> 01:23:35,650
Love is how you speak to me.

1114
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,450
You have a softness in your voice,that..

1115
01:23:42,600 --> 01:23:44,520
And love is how you touch me.

1116
01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:48,320
And guide me, showing me
the way to go.

1117
01:23:51,400 --> 01:23:52,440
And when we kiss..

1118
01:23:54,400 --> 01:23:55,270
.. when we kiss...

1119
01:23:58,700 --> 01:24:00,440
.. it moves me to my soul.

1120
01:24:18,600 --> 01:24:19,200
Dad!

1121
01:24:33,200 --> 01:24:35,420
Let's calm down right now.

1122
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:49,760
Hi!

1123
01:24:55,100 --> 01:24:57,080
I'm Danny's brother.

1124
01:24:57,800 --> 01:24:58,560
Hi!

1125
01:25:03,400 --> 01:25:05,090
I would love if you'd...

1126
01:25:05,191 --> 01:25:06,691
.. come and meet my family.

1127
01:25:12,400 --> 01:25:13,460
Is it OK?

1128
01:25:23,700 --> 01:25:25,690
This is Lisa.

1129
01:25:25,691 --> 01:25:27,091
She's Danny's friend.

1130
01:25:29,100 --> 01:25:30,670
This my mother Lucia.

1131
01:25:31,500 --> 01:25:34,460
My father Angelo and my
kid sister Maria.

1132
01:26:01,800 --> 01:26:03,610
What do you say, Danny?

1133
01:26:05,500 --> 01:26:06,890
Who are this people Danny?

1134
01:26:07,500 --> 01:26:09,610
Kids from my first grade class.

1135
01:26:10,200 --> 01:26:11,999
Why are you calling up their names?

1136
01:26:12,100 --> 01:26:13,600
Just checking my childhood memories.

1137
01:26:14,600 --> 01:26:16,499
- You're an asshole.
- Hey, stop...!

1138
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:20,220
- Morning ugly.
- They are not like this all the time.

1139
01:26:22,300 --> 01:26:25,580
- Is Lisa here?
- I'm right here, Danny.

1140
01:26:27,900 --> 01:26:29,350
She's so beautiful!

1141
01:26:30,800 --> 01:26:31,510
Lorenzo!

1142
01:26:34,600 --> 01:26:35,999
So I just wanted to tell you, that...

1143
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,000
.. i'm sorry about what I'd said
the other day.

1144
01:26:38,300 --> 01:26:40,499
You chosen the other guy
because I'm blind. I mean...

1145
01:26:40,600 --> 01:26:42,000
- .. that came out of totally...
- It's ok, it's ok.

1146
01:26:42,035 --> 01:26:44,670
- You know I'm also sorry,

1147
01:26:44,700 --> 01:26:47,230
that you split up and you
probably not gonna see him again.

1148
01:26:47,231 --> 01:26:49,331
- I'm.. I'm aware of all that..
- Stop!

1149
01:26:49,900 --> 01:26:51,480
Stop apologizing.

1150
01:26:55,500 --> 01:26:57,010
Are you wearing jasmine?

1151
01:26:59,800 --> 01:27:02,250
*So like I said*
*Things are going pretty well for me. *

1152
01:27:03,100 --> 01:27:06,499
*Lisa and I are finding out about*
*eachother and our different cultures*

1153
01:27:06,500 --> 01:27:08,250
*So are our families. *

1154
01:27:30,400 --> 01:27:33,790
- You think you can do that?
- Maybe? -God!

1155
01:27:34,300 --> 01:27:35,930
You are like a really pretty
sunshine..

1156
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:39,999
Hey, Larry, Suzie, what's going on?

1157
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:41,599
We're looking at Kamasutra.

1158
01:27:41,600 --> 01:27:43,799
Jay, these Indians..
they know how to party man.

1159
01:27:43,834 --> 01:27:44,400
Get real!

1160
01:28:11,600 --> 01:28:14,299
In my life I've always needed
the help of..

1161
01:28:14,300 --> 01:28:15,500
.. dear friends and dear family.

1162
01:28:16,500 --> 01:28:18,420
My brother Larry has been
always be my...

1163
01:28:18,621 --> 01:28:20,121
.. best friend and my brother.

1164
01:28:21,200 --> 01:28:22,680
But this is a joke and everything he's...

1165
01:28:22,681 --> 01:28:24,881
.. done for me over the years,
I wanna give him this.

1166
01:28:27,200 --> 01:28:30,340
- Thank you, love you bro.
- Love you too.

1167
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:34,630
Looks like a new limousine.

1168
01:28:44,700 --> 01:28:46,680
Alright, dancing part everybody.
Come on!

1169
01:28:56,199 --> 01:28:57,599
Shake it, here we go.

1170

*So I managed the alltime world record*

1171

1172
01:29:35,100 --> 01:29:36,810
*But come on!*

1173
01:29:37,111 --> 01:29:39,011
* I got the girl! *

1174
01:29:47,800 --> 01:29:48,830
