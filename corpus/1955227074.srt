00:00:00,768 --> 00:00:02,270
[Music playing]

2
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:50,344
[Yawn]

3
00:02:00,388 --> 00:02:01,589
This is it?

4
00:02:01,689 --> 00:02:04,192
This is the, uh...
Spooky old hideout?

5
00:02:04,292 --> 00:02:06,260
Yup.

6
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,696
Doesn't look so scary to me.

7
00:02:08,796 --> 00:02:11,199
The scariest places
never look scary.

8
00:02:11,299 --> 00:02:14,302
Most of the time they
look perfectly mundane.

9
00:02:14,402 --> 00:02:16,237
That's where they
get their power from.

10
00:02:16,337 --> 00:02:18,472
After all, if a place looked
creepy as a motherfucker,

11
00:02:18,572 --> 00:02:20,040
Who'd go there?

12
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,475
Example?

13
00:02:21,575 --> 00:02:22,743
OK.

14
00:02:22,843 --> 00:02:24,645
High school.

15
00:02:24,745 --> 00:02:25,679
Yeah.

16
00:02:25,779 --> 00:02:27,215
High school was a
pretty scary place.

17
00:02:27,315 --> 00:02:29,817
No one ever tells you that
the "high" in high school

18
00:02:29,917 --> 00:02:32,586
Means how high your
shit-stained underwear are gonna

19
00:02:32,686 --> 00:02:34,755
Be hanging from the flagpole.

20
00:02:34,855 --> 00:02:38,158
Funny, I, uh... I don't
remember your underwear ever

21
00:02:38,259 --> 00:02:39,227
Flying from a flagpole.

22
00:02:39,327 --> 00:02:40,394
Ha, yeah.

23
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:42,630
I guess you were the
expert in that department.

24
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:43,697
I dunno.

25
00:02:43,797 --> 00:02:46,300
Maybe it means, uh...
How high we all got.

26
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,635
We certainly did that.

27
00:02:50,371 --> 00:02:51,905
What the fuck
are we doing here?

28
00:03:30,244 --> 00:03:30,944
There it is.

29
00:03:34,948 --> 00:03:36,450
This place isn't haunted.

30
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:38,886
This place is a shit hole.

31
00:03:38,986 --> 00:03:42,390
You ever see a mad man
in a nice, swanky place?

32
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:43,524
No.

33
00:03:43,624 --> 00:03:46,660
They're all attracted
to shitty rundown holes.

34
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,729
Like Puerto Ricans.

35
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:50,130
That's no good.

36
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,400
Neither is your girlfriend,
but I'd still fuck her.

37
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,168
Will you two stop the bullshit?

38
00:03:55,269 --> 00:03:56,169
All right.

39
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:58,038
Tell me what we're
looking for again.

40
00:03:58,138 --> 00:04:01,942
Well, there are two
stories about this place.

41
00:04:02,042 --> 00:04:03,344
One is that it's haunted.

42
00:04:03,444 --> 00:04:04,845
Haunted by who?

43
00:04:04,945 --> 00:04:06,714
How the fuck do I know?

44
00:04:06,814 --> 00:04:07,981
Ghosts.

45
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:10,418
Not special ghosts, not famous
ghosts, just ghosts, OK?

46
00:04:10,518 --> 00:04:11,852
Is that good enough?

47
00:04:11,952 --> 00:04:13,854
Whatever.

48
00:04:13,954 --> 00:04:16,189
Anyway, the first legend
is that it's haunted.

49
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:18,559
The second is that
there's a crazy old

50
00:04:18,659 --> 00:04:22,696
Guy up there that escaped from
an insane asylum years ago.

51
00:04:22,796 --> 00:04:24,832
Why would he want to
live in a dump like this?

52
00:04:24,932 --> 00:04:26,300
Maybe he's Puerto Rican.

53
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,570
I dunno. 'Cause he's insane?

54
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:30,504
Hm.

55
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:32,640
So, by logic, if
someone's insane,

56
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:34,274
They would lack the
standards of common living.

57
00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:37,978
Apparently insane people don't
need interior decorators.

58
00:04:38,078 --> 00:04:41,248
Does your girlfriend use
an interior decorator?

59
00:04:41,349 --> 00:04:42,316
This sucks.

60
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:43,917
I'm ready to go home.

61
00:04:44,017 --> 00:04:47,054
Well, it's better than watching
you jerk off to a kid's show.

62
00:04:47,154 --> 00:04:48,889
I don't jerk off
to no kid's show.

63
00:04:48,989 --> 00:04:49,823
Bullshit.

64
00:04:49,923 --> 00:04:52,259
He's talking about
Lizzie McGuire.

65
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,961
Have you seen her?

66
00:04:54,061 --> 00:04:55,062
She's hot.

67
00:04:55,162 --> 00:04:56,364
You know what they say.

68
00:04:56,464 --> 00:05:00,568
16 can get you 20, but man,
that could be worth it.

69
00:05:00,668 --> 00:05:01,369
Whatever.

70
00:05:01,469 --> 00:05:02,169
Come on.

71
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:09,076
What was that?

72
00:05:09,176 --> 00:05:10,711
Maybe it was a rat.

73
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:11,979
CRAIG: Maybe crazy grandpa.

74
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:16,016
CHARLES: If you had a
life, you wouldn't be here.

75
00:05:16,116 --> 00:05:18,251
Maybe this isn't
such a good idea.

76
00:05:18,352 --> 00:05:20,821
Oh, would you quit crying
like a little bitch?

77
00:05:20,921 --> 00:05:23,090
I'm just saying, it...

78
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:24,558
[Rustling]

79
00:05:25,626 --> 00:05:26,894
What was that?

80
00:05:26,994 --> 00:05:29,262
Guys, what do you say we just
leave now, smoke some weed,

81
00:05:29,363 --> 00:05:31,832
Watch some "Lizzie McGuire,"
forget this ever happened.

82
00:05:31,932 --> 00:05:33,434
We'll get stoned
when we're done.

83
00:05:33,534 --> 00:05:34,568
No sooner, no later.

84
00:05:37,905 --> 00:05:41,308
It was probably a... you
know, a bobcat, or something.

85
00:05:41,409 --> 00:05:42,242
Yeah.

86
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:43,377
A bobcat.

87
00:05:43,477 --> 00:05:44,612
Yeah, I'm sure that's it.

88
00:05:44,712 --> 00:05:45,979
Who am I bullshitting?

89
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:48,716
We're all gonna fucking die.

90
00:05:48,816 --> 00:05:51,585
People have been here.

91
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:54,822
Well, there goes our chance
of making some great discovery.

92
00:05:54,922 --> 00:05:56,390
Like Columbus.

93
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:58,792
He's discovered a
continent full of people.

94
00:05:58,892 --> 00:05:59,727
OK.

95
00:05:59,827 --> 00:06:01,662
So we know people
have been here.

96
00:06:01,762 --> 00:06:04,197
But did they leave alive?

97
00:06:04,297 --> 00:06:05,198
This is insane.

98
00:06:05,298 --> 00:06:06,500
This is insane?

99
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,569
This whole fucking
desert is insane.

100
00:06:08,669 --> 00:06:09,903
I mean, did you guys
ever stop and think

101
00:06:10,003 --> 00:06:11,605
That maybe it was the
desert that made the old guy

102
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:14,074
Crazy in the first place?

103
00:06:14,174 --> 00:06:15,476
Why would any sane
person come out

104
00:06:15,576 --> 00:06:17,545
Here if they didn't have to?

105
00:06:17,645 --> 00:06:18,378
Exactly, Charles.

106
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:19,212
Exactly.

107
00:06:19,312 --> 00:06:20,848
You ask yourself that question.

108
00:06:20,948 --> 00:06:22,215
Guys, what are
you worried about?

109
00:06:22,315 --> 00:06:25,619
This is a shit hole cave out
in the middle of nowhere.

110
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:26,420
The story's a myth.

111
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,155
It's all bullshit.

112
00:06:28,255 --> 00:06:29,990
I mean, if it was
real, why haven't

113
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:31,959
The cops heard about this
place and raided it yet?

114
00:06:32,059 --> 00:06:33,927
Maybe they're scared too.

115
00:06:34,027 --> 00:06:35,262
So why aren't we?

116
00:06:35,362 --> 00:06:39,099
They're coming to get
you, [monster noises].

117

Where's Craig?

119
00:07:00,888 --> 00:07:02,122
Man, I dunno.

120
00:07:02,222 --> 00:07:03,657
He's probably around the corner
jerking off, or something.

121
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:04,592
Oh, wait.

122
00:07:04,692 --> 00:07:05,526
He can't.

123
00:07:05,626 --> 00:07:06,494
There are no kid's
shows on here.

124
00:07:06,594 --> 00:07:09,029
No, I'm serious.

125
00:07:09,129 --> 00:07:09,897
Man, I don't know.

126
00:07:09,997 --> 00:07:11,098
He probably went
back to the car.

127
00:07:11,198 --> 00:07:13,133
You saw he was about ready
to piss himself, right.

128
00:07:13,233 --> 00:07:14,502
I mean, he's probably
back at the car

129
00:07:14,602 --> 00:07:16,003
Right now, lighting
up a fat one.

130
00:07:16,103 --> 00:07:19,940
I mean, you know how Craig is.

00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,709
[Inaudible]?

132
00:07:21,809 --> 00:07:23,076
Fuck no.

Do you know how much fun it's
gonna be to tell everyone we

134
00:07:24,978 --> 00:07:28,549
Scared the shit out of Craig.

135
00:07:28,649 --> 00:07:31,184
You just love to torment
your brother, don't you?

If we manage to capture a
crazy old guy, we'll be famous.

We'll be on the Springer show
and get laid all the time.

00:10:24,825 --> 00:10:27,594
I'll tell you what.

186
00:10:27,695 --> 00:10:30,063
I'll kill you last.

187
00:10:30,163 --> 00:10:31,164
Huh?

188
00:10:31,264 --> 00:10:33,266
I'll kill you last,
and I'll do it quickly.

189
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:34,501
One slice of the jugular.

190
00:10:34,601 --> 00:10:36,336
How does that sound?

191
00:10:36,436 --> 00:10:37,838
Sounds good?

192
00:10:37,938 --> 00:10:39,306
[Laughter]

193
00:10:43,276 --> 00:10:46,046
You must be the leader of
this little expedition, huh?

194
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:48,481
The alpha male.

195
00:10:48,581 --> 00:10:50,217
Oh!

196
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:51,451
You get to go first.

197
00:10:51,551 --> 00:10:54,587
After all, leadership
does have its privileges.

198
00:10:54,688 --> 00:10:56,089
[Sobbing]

199
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:08,535
You know what they say...
Curiosity killed the shithead.

200
00:11:08,635 --> 00:11:09,837
A little kidney.

201
00:11:09,937 --> 00:11:11,338
[Laughter]

202
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,174
Oh, yes.

203
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:19,279
What do we have here?

204
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:24,117
Mm.

205
00:11:24,217 --> 00:11:25,518
Mm, mm!

206
00:11:28,956 --> 00:11:32,793
It seems you're as
tasty as you are feisty.

207
00:11:32,893 --> 00:11:34,061
I've had better, of course.

208
00:11:34,161 --> 00:11:35,896
But not bad.

209
00:11:35,996 --> 00:11:39,032
Not bad at all.

210
00:11:39,132 --> 00:11:41,034
What else you got in there?

211
00:11:47,107 --> 00:11:48,976
[Whimpering]

212
00:11:52,112 --> 00:11:52,980
No...

213
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:53,847
Eat up.

214
00:11:53,947 --> 00:11:54,848
Eat up.

215
00:11:54,948 --> 00:11:56,583
It'll help you
regain your strength.

216
00:11:56,683 --> 00:11:57,918
[Laughter]

217
00:11:58,886 --> 00:12:00,387
Just let us go.

218
00:12:00,487 --> 00:12:01,488
All in due time.

219
00:12:01,588 --> 00:12:04,291
Right now we have more
important work to do.

220
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:07,427
Very important work.

221
00:12:07,527 --> 00:12:08,896
You really are to be commended.

222
00:12:08,996 --> 00:12:11,331
You're quite delicious.

223
00:12:11,431 --> 00:12:13,533
I've had better, of
course, but not bad, right?

224
00:12:13,633 --> 00:12:14,567
He's really good.

225
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:16,169
Not bad at all.

226
00:12:16,269 --> 00:12:16,970
Bastard.

227
00:12:19,706 --> 00:12:20,407
I better hurry.

228
00:12:20,507 --> 00:12:21,541
He's going quickly.

229
00:12:21,641 --> 00:12:23,043
You know, some things
are best served cold...

230
00:12:23,143 --> 00:12:24,244
- Don't kill me...
- Hold on.

231
00:12:24,344 --> 00:12:25,779
Some things are best
served cold, but alpha male

232
00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:27,815
Really is best when served warm.

233
00:12:40,693 --> 00:12:42,095
[Laughter]

234
00:12:56,944 --> 00:12:59,813
Always tastes freshest
straight from the tap.

235
00:13:04,017 --> 00:13:05,718
I don't care what you do.

236
00:13:05,819 --> 00:13:06,653
Just do it fast.

237
00:13:10,223 --> 00:13:12,459
Aw.

238
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:16,663
You know, I didn't mean
to kill your friends.

239
00:13:16,763 --> 00:13:18,966
I mean, you can still get out
of this, though, you know?

240
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:25,505
All right.

241
00:13:25,605 --> 00:13:26,306
You got me.

242
00:13:26,406 --> 00:13:27,307
I'm lying.

243
00:13:27,407 --> 00:13:29,242
So sue me!

244
00:13:29,342 --> 00:13:30,677
[Laughter]

245
00:13:33,713 --> 00:13:35,983
What are you gonna do?

246
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:37,384
Take a blade and chop
me up and eat me?

247
00:13:40,353 --> 00:13:41,688
No.

248
00:13:41,788 --> 00:13:44,624
I'm not just gonna kill you.

249
00:13:44,724 --> 00:13:48,628
I'm gonna give you the
gift that keeps on giving.

250
00:13:48,728 --> 00:13:54,167
I'm... I'm gonna make you live.

251
00:13:54,267 --> 00:13:56,436
For eternity!

252
00:13:56,536 --> 00:13:57,905
[Laughter]

253
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:13,720
Turn over, you little bitch.

254
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:15,222
[Screaming]

255
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:19,159
Ride 'em cowboy.

256
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:26,566
You little motherfucker.

257
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:29,536
You're gonna take
it and love it.

258
00:14:29,636 --> 00:14:31,504
Yeah.

259
00:14:31,604 --> 00:14:34,307
Daddy likes his ponies.

260
00:14:34,407 --> 00:14:35,742
[Grunting]

261
00:14:52,425 --> 00:14:54,761
Shh.

262
00:14:54,861 --> 00:14:56,063
Everything's gonna be OK.

263
00:15:05,638 --> 00:15:09,209
Uh... I guess I'm
your internet date.

264
00:15:09,309 --> 00:15:10,077
CRAIG: Kim, right?

265
00:15:10,177 --> 00:15:10,877
Please come in.

266
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:16,883
I guess I should officially
introduce myself.

267
00:15:16,984 --> 00:15:19,586
I'm Craig.

268
00:15:19,686 --> 00:15:21,921
Where's your restroom?

269
00:15:22,022 --> 00:15:23,223
Just in the corner there.

270
00:15:34,734 --> 00:15:40,073
This is not the guy that I
picked out on the internet.

271
00:15:40,173 --> 00:15:42,575
He looks nothing like that.

272
00:15:42,675 --> 00:15:44,044
Oh my god, what am I gonna do?

273
00:15:44,144 --> 00:15:48,515
How am I gonna get out of here?

274
00:15:48,615 --> 00:15:49,516
Oh my god.

275
00:15:49,616 --> 00:15:50,317
OK.

276
00:15:50,417 --> 00:15:52,685
Just have to think.

277
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:53,620
All right.

278
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,955
Just, uh... tell
him that you left

279
00:15:56,056 --> 00:15:57,290
Your curling iron on
at home, and you've

280
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:58,925
Gotta go back right away.

281
00:15:59,026 --> 00:16:02,395
Yeah, that'll work.

282
00:16:02,495 --> 00:16:03,396
Oh my god.

283
00:16:03,496 --> 00:16:04,897
[Knocking]

284
00:16:06,499 --> 00:16:07,400
I'll just be a minute.

285
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:10,603
I'm just... I'm just
washing my hands.

286
00:16:10,703 --> 00:16:12,605
Oh my god.

287
00:16:12,705 --> 00:16:13,406
OK.

288
00:16:13,506 --> 00:16:14,507
The curling iron trick.

289
00:16:14,607 --> 00:16:15,308
Yeah.

290
00:16:15,408 --> 00:16:16,243
That one always works.

291
00:16:16,343 --> 00:16:18,111
Um... just one minute!

292
00:16:25,618 --> 00:16:27,954
God, I don't want
to touch that towel.

293
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:35,062
Can I have a little
bit of privacy please?

294
00:16:35,162 --> 00:16:36,229
Let's skip all
the getting-to-know

295
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:37,497
Chit-chat bullshit.

296
00:16:37,597 --> 00:16:38,698
I'm ready to fuck.

297
00:16:38,798 --> 00:16:40,133
What's the matter with you?

298
00:16:40,233 --> 00:16:40,933
Ahh!

299
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:02,255
[Squishing]

300
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:11,731
It's the best part of sex.

301
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,181
Good.

302
00:17:28,281 --> 00:17:29,349
I left her breathless.

303
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:38,691
Tell you what.

304
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:40,760
After 15 years on the job, shit
like this doesn't... doesn't get

305
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:42,262
Any easier.

306
00:17:42,362 --> 00:17:43,463
This is one sick
fuck we're dealing

307
00:17:43,563 --> 00:17:46,099
With here, that's for sure.

308
00:17:46,199 --> 00:17:47,200
I'll tell you what.

309
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:48,435
Since this is your first
gig as a detective,

310
00:17:48,535 --> 00:17:50,036
You gotta stick close
to me on this one

311
00:17:50,137 --> 00:17:51,871
And just watch me work.

312
00:17:51,971 --> 00:17:55,041
It's gonna take the boys down in
forensics more than a few hours

313
00:17:55,142 --> 00:17:58,878
To figure out this,
uh... this mess here.

314
00:17:58,978 --> 00:18:01,581
Well, what do we do now?

315
00:18:01,681 --> 00:18:03,483
Well, you know, I noticed
a, uh... I noticed a bar

316
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:05,185
Around the corner, and it's
likely that someone saw

317
00:18:05,285 --> 00:18:06,553
Or heard something,
so I think that we

318
00:18:06,653 --> 00:18:08,788
Should probably go on over there
and poke around a little bit.

319
00:18:08,888 --> 00:18:09,689
All right, I'll head over.

320
00:18:16,163 --> 00:18:16,863
Sorry, boys.

321
00:18:22,735 --> 00:18:24,571
OK.

322
00:18:24,671 --> 00:18:28,175
So tell me about your flight.

323
00:18:28,275 --> 00:18:29,242
First class?

324
00:18:29,342 --> 00:18:30,677
How did you get first
class, girlfriend?

325
00:18:33,546 --> 00:18:35,382
What'd you do?

326
00:18:35,482 --> 00:18:36,183
Was he hot?

327
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:42,522
You're learning from me.

328
00:18:45,358 --> 00:18:47,227
Well, I'm gonna get
started on dinner.

329
00:18:47,327 --> 00:18:50,830
So what time do you
want me to pick you up?

330
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:54,801
I'll go get a bottle of wine.

331
00:18:54,901 --> 00:18:56,135
OK.

332
00:18:56,236 --> 00:18:57,036
All right.
Love you.

333
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:57,837
Miss you.

334
00:18:57,937 --> 00:18:58,638

where you're at.

you're gonna come with us.

like being around that.

00:21:48,174 --> 00:21:49,842
You know anything about
what I'm talking about?

371
00:21:49,942 --> 00:21:50,643
BARTENDER: Nope.

372
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:57,817
Maybe this'll help jar
that memory of yours.

373
00:21:57,917 --> 00:21:59,285
BARTENDER: Eh, forget it.

374
00:21:59,386 --> 00:22:01,253
I'm not telling you shit.

375
00:22:01,354 --> 00:22:03,289
Worth a try.

376
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:04,957
Let me show you how
you do it my way.

377
00:22:05,057 --> 00:22:06,125
Hey, bartender,
come here a minute.

378
00:22:06,225 --> 00:22:07,994
Lean in just a little
bit closer, will ya?

379
00:22:08,094 --> 00:22:10,096
You didn't convince
me, motherfucker.

380
00:22:10,196 --> 00:22:13,299
Now he's gonna ask
you again, so speak.

381
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:18,170
Did you or anybody else see
anything unusual around here

382
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:19,972
Last night?

383
00:22:20,072 --> 00:22:21,508
Do I still get my $20?

384
00:22:21,608 --> 00:22:22,375
Wrong answer, buddy!

385
00:22:22,475 --> 00:22:25,344
Now speak!

386
00:22:25,445 --> 00:22:28,280
Look, all I know is
that one of the regulars

387
00:22:28,381 --> 00:22:30,717
Was taking a piss out in
the back, releasing himself.

388
00:22:30,817 --> 00:22:34,954
And he saw these body parts
all chopped up and shit.

389
00:22:35,054 --> 00:22:36,288
Deader than Elvis.

390
00:22:36,389 --> 00:22:38,024
That's all I know.

391
00:22:38,124 --> 00:22:40,427
That's all you know.

392
00:22:40,527 --> 00:22:46,733
Well, if you happen to,
uh, learn anything else...

393
00:22:46,833 --> 00:22:48,501
You call us, all right, buddy?

394
00:22:48,601 --> 00:22:49,301
You understand?

395
00:22:56,676 --> 00:22:57,677
Donut-eating dickheads.

396
00:22:57,777 --> 00:22:58,478
Pigs.

397
00:23:16,763 --> 00:23:17,730
[Beep]

398
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:18,931
BOB (ON VOICEMAIL):
Hey, Tara, it's Bob.

399
00:23:19,031 --> 00:23:21,100
Uh, I heard your sister
passed away, you know?

400
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,902
If, uh, you need any
help, give me a call.

401
00:23:36,182 --> 00:23:37,517
Fucking psycho.

402
00:23:57,036 --> 00:23:58,905
[Knocking]

403
00:24:12,952 --> 00:24:14,353
[Phone ringing]

404
00:24:21,494 --> 00:24:22,461
- Yeah, hello?
- Yeah.

405
00:24:22,562 --> 00:24:23,530
Would you answer your damn door?

406
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:26,766
I've been out here
for 15 minutes.

407
00:24:26,866 --> 00:24:27,767
Oh, fuck.

408
00:24:33,372 --> 00:24:35,274
About time.

409
00:24:35,374 --> 00:24:37,644
I told you, I'm not going.

410
00:24:37,744 --> 00:24:39,111
Oh, come on.

411
00:24:39,211 --> 00:24:40,179
Come on, Tara.

412
00:24:40,279 --> 00:24:41,313
You are not gonna
mope around this house

413
00:24:41,413 --> 00:24:42,682
For the rest of your life.

414
00:24:42,782 --> 00:24:46,318
You have to take control of
what happened to you and go on.

415
00:24:46,418 --> 00:24:49,055
You make it sound so easy,
but unfortunately, it's not.

416
00:24:49,155 --> 00:24:51,457
If it was your sister
who had gotten hacked up

417
00:24:51,558 --> 00:24:54,126
By some fucking sociopath,
maybe you would see things

418
00:24:54,226 --> 00:24:56,929
A little bit differently.

419
00:24:57,029 --> 00:24:57,930
OK, come here.

420
00:24:58,030 --> 00:25:00,399
Come here.

421
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:03,870
Look, I know that this
was traumatic for you.

422
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:05,371
And I'm not trying
to discount that.

423
00:25:05,471 --> 00:25:08,474
It's just that... I mean,
I'm worried about you.

424
00:25:08,575 --> 00:25:09,776
This isn't normal.

425
00:25:09,876 --> 00:25:11,043
This situation isn't normal.

426
00:25:11,143 --> 00:25:11,844
OK.

427
00:25:11,944 --> 00:25:13,345
Even then, it's not right.

428
00:25:16,182 --> 00:25:18,484
I know this sounds like
a little bit of a cliche,

429
00:25:18,585 --> 00:25:19,919
But do you really
think Jen would want

430
00:25:20,019 --> 00:25:22,555
You hiding out in this house?

431
00:25:22,655 --> 00:25:23,489
Come on, Tara.

432
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:25,892
That wasn't Jen at all.

433
00:25:25,992 --> 00:25:28,795
You know she would have
wanted you out there.

434
00:25:28,895 --> 00:25:31,864
Besides, if you drink a
little bit, we can... you know,

435
00:25:31,964 --> 00:25:32,799
Push it back.

436
00:25:35,334 --> 00:25:36,035
Come on.

437
00:25:36,135 --> 00:25:37,269
Just for tonight.

438
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:39,338
You deserve it.

439
00:25:39,438 --> 00:25:41,107
Right?

440
00:25:41,207 --> 00:25:43,275
Get your little
knapsack and come on.

441
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:44,076
We're going.

442
00:25:44,176 --> 00:25:44,877
My knapsack.

443
00:25:44,977 --> 00:25:46,278
Get your knapsack.

444
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:48,047
Chop, chop, chop.

445
00:25:48,147 --> 00:25:48,881
I'm moving.

446
00:26:01,027 --> 00:26:02,895
You've gotta be kidding me.

447
00:26:02,995 --> 00:26:04,797
There's no fucking way
I'm going over there.

448
00:26:04,897 --> 00:26:05,598
Oh, yeah?

449
00:26:05,698 --> 00:26:06,799
Yes you are.

450
00:26:06,899 --> 00:26:09,168
This is exactly what you
need... a little nostalgia.

451
00:26:09,268 --> 00:26:09,969
Ugh.

452
00:26:10,069 --> 00:26:11,638
Carrie, this is where...

453
00:26:11,738 --> 00:26:14,373
Oh, yeah this is where... I know
where this is where it's at.

454
00:26:14,473 --> 00:26:16,375
Why do you think we're here?

455
00:26:16,475 --> 00:26:18,778
He's not gonna be here, is he?

456
00:26:18,878 --> 00:26:20,046
Oh my god.
That is such a great idea.

457
00:26:20,146 --> 00:26:21,648
- No!
- I'm gonna call him.

458
00:26:21,748 --> 00:26:23,149
- No!
- I'm gonna call him!

459
00:26:23,249 --> 00:26:24,283
Oh my god.

460
00:26:24,383 --> 00:26:25,084
Rick?

461
00:26:25,184 --> 00:26:25,885
Rick, hi.

462
00:26:25,985 --> 00:26:27,053
It's Tara.

463
00:26:27,153 --> 00:26:28,520
I'm where you popped my cherry.

464
00:26:28,621 --> 00:26:31,958
Wanna come
[inaudible] some more?

465
00:26:32,058 --> 00:26:35,394
You're such a bitch.

466
00:26:35,494 --> 00:26:36,896
I know.

467
00:26:36,996 --> 00:26:38,364
Fucking cunt.

468
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:40,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

469
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:42,769
So who's gonna be here?

470
00:26:42,869 --> 00:26:44,236
Who do you think?

471
00:26:44,336 --> 00:26:48,675
You know you're more of a
pain in the ass than a help.

472
00:26:48,775 --> 00:26:49,809
OK!

473
00:26:49,909 --> 00:26:50,609
Ow.

474
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:51,711
I'm sorry.

475
00:26:51,811 --> 00:26:52,679
Ow!

476
00:26:52,779 --> 00:26:54,113
No, it's just gonna
be... you know.

477
00:26:54,213 --> 00:26:55,581
The usual suspects.

478
00:26:55,682 --> 00:26:57,049
All the girls.

479
00:26:57,149 --> 00:26:58,050
So weird.

480
00:26:58,150 --> 00:27:00,987
It's almost like deja vu.

481
00:27:01,087 --> 00:27:02,088
I can see them.

482
00:27:02,188 --> 00:27:05,224
It's like everybody
from that exact night.

483
00:27:05,324 --> 00:27:06,525
That exact night.

484
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:07,994
That exact night.

485
00:27:08,094 --> 00:27:10,396
It was hell of a slumber
party, wasn't it?

486
00:27:10,496 --> 00:27:11,864
Yeah, it was.

487
00:27:11,964 --> 00:27:14,801
But I don't feel good.

488
00:27:14,901 --> 00:27:16,235
You're gonna feel good.

489
00:27:16,335 --> 00:27:17,203
That's why we're here.

490
00:27:17,303 --> 00:27:18,838
What are we doing?

491
00:27:18,938 --> 00:27:19,638
We're partying.

492
00:27:19,739 --> 00:27:20,606
We're gonna drink.

493
00:27:20,707 --> 00:27:22,074
I got a ton of liquor.

494
00:27:22,174 --> 00:27:23,342
I got some great weed.

495
00:27:26,278 --> 00:27:27,646
Whatever.

496
00:27:27,747 --> 00:27:29,115
Whatever.

497
00:27:29,215 --> 00:27:32,018
Fucking bitch.

498
00:27:32,118 --> 00:27:33,019
Fucking bitch.

499
00:27:33,119 --> 00:27:33,820
Bitch.

500
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:36,923
Fucking bitch, cunt, whore.

501
00:27:37,023 --> 00:27:37,890
Stupid slut.

502
00:27:40,927 --> 00:27:43,129
You're my only real friend
that's gonna be there.

503
00:27:43,229 --> 00:27:44,096
I know.

504
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:11,924
Hi, guys.

505
00:28:12,024 --> 00:28:12,825
All right, ladies.

506
00:28:12,925 --> 00:28:14,193
Who's got liquor?

507
00:28:14,293 --> 00:28:15,194
I do.

508
00:28:15,294 --> 00:28:15,995
All right.

509
00:28:16,095 --> 00:28:16,963
Let's go swimming.

510
00:28:17,063 --> 00:28:17,764
Woo-hoo!

511
00:28:20,599 --> 00:28:21,300
Oh my god.

512
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,234
I feel so sick.

513
00:28:22,334 --> 00:28:24,236
She's the worst driver ever.

514
00:28:24,336 --> 00:28:25,271
I'm the best driver.

515
00:28:25,371 --> 00:28:27,473
We, like, barreled
around that turn.

516

Oh, fuck it.

Let's just go smoke some
pot and drink some beer.

522
00:29:41,747 --> 00:29:42,448
Woo-hoo!

523
00:29:49,721 --> 00:29:51,123
Here's to our last
great night together.

524
00:29:51,223 --> 00:29:51,924
Yeah!

525
00:29:52,024 --> 00:29:54,660
Woo!

526
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:58,464
So, who's dating someone now?

527
00:29:58,564 --> 00:29:59,465
Not me.

528
00:29:59,565 --> 00:30:01,267
Shawna's dating
Herc Krish right now.

529
00:30:01,367 --> 00:30:04,170
Ooh.

530
00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:06,138
WOMAN: Shawna, details, details.

531
00:30:06,238 --> 00:30:09,008
Inquiring minds want to know.

532
00:30:09,108 --> 00:30:12,444
Well, we've been
dating for about a week.

533
00:30:12,544 --> 00:30:15,481
Uh... Sandy Robertson
hooked us up.

534
00:30:15,581 --> 00:30:17,249
WOMAN: And?

535
00:30:17,349 --> 00:30:19,151
It's no big deal.

536
00:30:19,251 --> 00:30:21,287
WOMAN: But... does
he have a big deal?

537
00:30:24,023 --> 00:30:25,858
It's a good size.

538
00:30:25,958 --> 00:30:27,960

already been at it?

539
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:29,028
Hells yeah.

540
00:30:29,128 --> 00:30:30,662
First night.

541
00:30:30,762 --> 00:30:32,698
WOMAN: Oh, don't hold
out or anything, slut.

542
00:30:32,798 --> 00:30:34,233
Shit, would you?

543
00:30:34,333 --> 00:30:35,134
WOMAN: For that?

544
00:30:35,234 --> 00:30:37,937
No.

545
00:30:38,037 --> 00:30:39,738
I didn't know talk
about big dicks

546
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:42,108
Frightened you so much, Tara.

547
00:30:42,208 --> 00:30:44,510
Fuck... fucking bitch.

548
00:30:44,610 --> 00:30:45,511
You OK, girl?

549
00:30:45,611 --> 00:30:46,712
Uh... yeah, I'm fine.

550
00:30:52,218 --> 00:30:55,955
So, um... what's everyone
been up to since last time we

551
00:30:56,055 --> 00:30:57,023
Hung out.

552
00:30:57,123 --> 00:30:58,824
I've been working
at the radio station.

553
00:30:58,925 --> 00:31:00,192
Yeah, I heard you.

554
00:31:00,292 --> 00:31:01,160
Yeah.

555
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:02,361
I was, uh, thinking
about calling up

556
00:31:02,461 --> 00:31:04,063
And telling your listeners
some embarrassing story

557
00:31:04,163 --> 00:31:04,863
From your past.

558
00:31:04,964 --> 00:31:06,032
My listeners?

559
00:31:06,132 --> 00:31:07,266
Really don't have
many listeners.

560
00:31:07,366 --> 00:31:11,437
I think our average listener
is, like, 120, anyway.

561
00:31:11,537 --> 00:31:13,505
Well, I'm still trying
to get through college.

562
00:31:13,605 --> 00:31:16,442
It's been a bitch trying
to finish everything up.

563
00:31:16,542 --> 00:31:20,346
All I've got left to
take is college algebra.

564
00:31:20,446 --> 00:31:21,147
Ew.

565
00:31:21,247 --> 00:31:22,414
I hate math.

566
00:31:22,514 --> 00:31:23,815
Me, too.

567
00:31:23,916 --> 00:31:26,052
I mean, I don't understand why
I have to take algebra, anyway.

568
00:31:26,152 --> 00:31:27,920
Can somebody please tell
me what college algebra has

569
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:31,423
To do with criminal justice?

570
00:31:31,523 --> 00:31:33,325
What about you?

571
00:31:33,425 --> 00:31:36,295
Oh... oh, um... let me see.

572
00:31:36,395 --> 00:31:38,497
My last job I got
fired from because I

573
00:31:38,597 --> 00:31:40,199
Was late for nine days.

574
00:31:40,299 --> 00:31:41,767
My parents just got divorced.

575
00:31:41,867 --> 00:31:42,768
My last boyfriend?

576
00:31:42,868 --> 00:31:44,336
Well, he left me
for another man.

577
00:31:44,436 --> 00:31:46,638
And my sister... well, you
know, she just got hacked up

578
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:48,374
By some fucking sociopath.

579
00:31:48,474 --> 00:31:49,641
Fuck all of you.

580
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:50,676
Your petty bullshit.

581
00:31:53,445 --> 00:31:54,713
Oh, here we go.

582
00:32:01,253 --> 00:32:04,290
So, uh... who's dating
the biggest dick?

583
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:05,424
Yeah.

584
00:32:05,524 --> 00:32:08,060
My boyfriend made me pay
for dinner last night.

585
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,761
That's not the kind of
dick I was talking about.

586
00:32:13,799 --> 00:32:15,934
I think I'm gonna go talk to
Barnett up in forensics, see

587
00:32:16,035 --> 00:32:18,804
If he, uh... could distinguish
anything from those bodies.

588
00:32:18,904 --> 00:32:21,640
Or what was left of
those bodies, actually.

589
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:23,409
Why don't you do that, and
we'll meet back over here

590
00:32:23,509 --> 00:32:24,210
In a couple hours?

591
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:25,577
What are you gonna do?

592
00:32:25,677 --> 00:32:27,579
I'm gonna hang around here and
talk to a few stool pigeons,

593
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:28,947
See what they might know.

594
00:32:31,817 --> 00:32:33,252
Well, maybe I
should come with you.

595
00:32:33,352 --> 00:32:34,620
No, you go back to
the station, Donovan.

596
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:35,821
Trust me.

597
00:32:35,921 --> 00:32:37,823
It's, uh... you're not
gonna like my methods

598
00:32:37,923 --> 00:32:40,326
Of extracting information,
and it's better for both of us

599
00:32:40,426 --> 00:32:41,327
If you don't go.

600
00:32:47,399 --> 00:32:48,300
Come on, man!

608
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:41,199
Los Angeles used to be a safe
town, then it got dangerous.

We let in, you know...
The, uh, you-know-whats.

610
00:36:42,868 --> 00:36:45,103
I used to have to
look over my shoulder?

611
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:46,872
Now, with this killer
midget running loose,

612
00:36:46,972 --> 00:36:48,507
I gotta look behind my shins.

613
00:36:48,607 --> 00:36:49,541
It's really... it's awful.

614
00:36:49,641 --> 00:36:50,876
I got a pain in my back.

615
00:36:50,976 --> 00:36:52,344
It's bad for my sacroiliac.

616
00:36:52,444 --> 00:36:54,145
Kill the midgets,
that's what I say!

617
00:36:54,246 --> 00:36:55,381
Kill the midgets!

618
00:36:55,481 --> 00:36:57,283
And there are lots of us
who say kill the midgets,

619
00:36:57,383 --> 00:36:58,417
Kill the midgets.

620

Kill all midgets!

never done anything.

dollars to donuts,

on the department.

I mean that he's been
getting away with it

And he's never been arrested.

855
00:53:24,669 --> 00:53:26,971

00:56:18,409 --> 00:56:19,444
Same old shit.

924
00:56:19,544 --> 00:56:22,480
Need to try something new.

925
00:56:22,580 --> 00:56:23,481
Please stop.

926
00:56:26,551 --> 00:56:28,419
[Laughter]

927
00:56:33,491 --> 00:56:38,128
Missy, have I got plans for you.

928
00:56:38,228 --> 00:56:39,597
[Screaming]

929
00:56:44,134 --> 00:56:47,071
I just love that.

930
00:56:47,171 --> 00:56:49,339
But now that I think
about it, this is

931
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:51,642
Really such an overused weapon.

932
00:56:51,742 --> 00:56:54,612
It's so yesterday, you know?

933
00:56:54,712 --> 00:56:57,982
Become such a cliche.

934
00:56:58,082 --> 00:56:58,916
Ah.

935
00:56:59,016 --> 00:57:00,317
No, please.

936
00:57:00,417 --> 00:57:01,185
Done that, too.

937
00:57:06,390 --> 00:57:07,725
Do you have any ideas?

938
00:57:07,825 --> 00:57:10,427
What the fuck is
wrong with you?

939
00:57:10,528 --> 00:57:12,497
Ain't nothing wrong with me.

940
00:57:12,597 --> 00:57:16,233
It's like the man says...
Just doing my job.

941
00:57:16,333 --> 00:57:17,802
Your job?

942
00:57:17,902 --> 00:57:18,603
Yeah.

943
00:57:18,703 --> 00:57:21,205
My job.

944
00:57:21,305 --> 00:57:24,408
I was caught using fresh
dead bodies from the morgue,

945
00:57:24,509 --> 00:57:30,515
So now I have to kill
to feed my experiments.

946
00:57:30,615 --> 00:57:32,950
Your experiments?

947
00:57:33,050 --> 00:57:34,919
What are you...

948
00:57:35,019 --> 00:57:37,354
My precious
children, I call them.

949
00:57:41,892 --> 00:57:46,430
I create my experiments
by using the body parts

950
00:57:46,531 --> 00:57:50,200
From the dead human beings.

951
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:51,168
Shh.

952
00:57:51,268 --> 00:57:53,403
You should feel privileged.

953
00:57:53,504 --> 00:57:57,141
Right now I'm needing a leg,
and yours should do just fine.

954
00:57:57,241 --> 00:57:59,109
You're not taking my leg!

955
00:57:59,209 --> 00:58:01,078
[Inaudible]!

956
00:58:01,178 --> 00:58:03,047
[Screaming]

957
00:58:14,258 --> 00:58:18,028
Before I take your
leg, maybe you'd

958
00:58:18,128 --> 00:58:21,131
Like to see the children, hm?

959
00:58:21,231 --> 00:58:23,701
It might make you feel
a little bit better

960
00:58:23,801 --> 00:58:26,136
About the contribution
you're about to make.

961
00:58:29,006 --> 00:58:31,375
They really are quite brilliant,
if I do say so myself.

962
00:58:34,879 --> 00:58:39,149
It's taken years of
work to perfect them.

963
00:58:39,249 --> 00:58:41,586
But I'm finally
getting to the point

964
00:58:41,686 --> 00:58:44,021
Where I can make any
body part work on them.

965
00:58:47,758 --> 00:58:51,295
Soon I'll have exactly what the
government has always wanted.

966
00:58:57,001 --> 00:58:57,702
Shh.

967
00:59:03,273 --> 00:59:06,644
You see, the government
hired me to create

968
00:59:06,744 --> 00:59:11,015
An army of unstoppable,
indestructible creatures.

969
00:59:16,854 --> 00:59:21,258
Until they mentioned it, I never
even really thought about it.

970
00:59:21,358 --> 00:59:22,693
[Inaudible]

971
00:59:22,793 --> 00:59:25,129
They're not going
to get my children.

972
00:59:28,165 --> 00:59:31,969
I have other plans
for them entirely.

973
00:59:32,069 --> 00:59:35,372
Big plans.

974
00:59:35,472 --> 00:59:36,607
Like what?

975
00:59:36,707 --> 00:59:38,075
[Sobbing]

976
00:59:39,644 --> 00:59:40,711
[Laughter]

977
00:59:41,879 --> 00:59:44,348
Well, darling, like
all mad scientists,

978
00:59:44,448 --> 00:59:49,153
I suppose, I one day
would really love

979
00:59:49,253 --> 00:59:52,089
To take over the fucking world.

980
01:00:03,067 --> 01:00:03,934
Come quickly.

981
01:00:10,340 --> 01:00:11,642
I'll show them to you.

982
01:00:15,545 --> 01:00:17,782
Oh, you're really
gonna like this.

983
01:00:29,660 --> 01:00:30,360
Fuck.

984
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:31,862
Daddy's here, now.

985
01:00:37,835 --> 01:00:39,704
Come see the children.

986
01:00:39,804 --> 01:00:40,705
Come on.

987
01:00:40,805 --> 01:00:42,673
Come on.

988
01:00:42,773 --> 01:00:44,141
Ah!

989
01:00:44,241 --> 01:00:45,409
[Laughter]

990
01:00:45,509 --> 01:00:46,276
You'll be fine.

991
01:00:46,376 --> 01:00:48,278
You're a real trooper.

992
01:00:48,378 --> 01:00:49,747
[Screaming]

993
01:00:51,348 --> 01:00:52,216
Take a good look.

994
01:00:52,316 --> 01:00:54,919
Oh god, oh god, oh god, oh god.

995
01:00:55,019 --> 01:00:55,720
Please don't.

996
01:00:55,820 --> 01:00:57,287
Please stop.
Please stop.

997
01:00:57,387 --> 01:00:58,188
He's my child.

998
01:00:58,288 --> 01:00:59,656
Look at him!

999
01:00:59,757 --> 01:01:01,158
[Cackling]

1000
01:01:05,730 --> 01:01:08,098
Good, good.

1001
01:01:08,198 --> 01:01:10,100
I love you, my boy.

1002
01:01:15,639 --> 01:01:18,809
He's such a good boy.

1003
01:01:18,909 --> 01:01:20,811
Go ahead.

1004
01:01:20,911 --> 01:01:21,812
Go ahead.

1005
01:01:21,912 --> 01:01:23,280
OK, OK.

1006
01:01:23,380 --> 01:01:24,281
Say hello.

1007
01:01:32,823 --> 01:01:33,724
Come here.

1008
01:01:33,824 --> 01:01:34,725
Come here, you.

1009
01:02:04,654 --> 01:02:08,292
One of these days
I'm gonna win a Nobel

1010
01:02:08,392 --> 01:02:12,596
Prize for my experiments.

1011
01:02:12,696 --> 01:02:15,365
Killing people is a strange
way to achieve a peace prize.

1012
01:02:22,239 --> 01:02:23,473
Perhaps you'll
get an opportunity

1013
01:02:23,573 --> 01:02:28,212
To learn an appreciation for
my experiments [inaudible].

1014
01:02:35,285 --> 01:02:37,087
Wake up, darling.

1015
01:02:37,187 --> 01:02:38,522
[Kissing sounds]

1016
01:02:38,622 --> 01:02:39,656

[Screaming]

1018
01:02:42,226 --> 01:02:44,494
Look at those teeth!

1019
01:02:44,594 --> 01:02:49,633
Oh, those would be
perfect for Shawn Michael.

1020
01:02:49,733 --> 01:02:50,734
Hang in there, darling.

1021
01:02:50,835 --> 01:02:51,535
Hang in there.

1022
01:02:51,635 --> 01:02:52,636
TARA: What are you doing?

1023
01:02:52,736 --> 01:02:54,438
I'm experimenting.

1024
01:02:54,538 --> 01:02:57,441
You can't make a frittata
without breaking a few eggs,

1025
01:02:57,541 --> 01:02:58,642
You know?

1026
01:02:58,742 --> 01:03:00,978
TARA: Let her fucking go!

1027
01:03:01,078 --> 01:03:07,051
Oh, because that would just
make things a little bit worse.

1028
01:03:07,151 --> 01:03:08,986
TARA: We won't say anything.

1029
01:03:12,957 --> 01:03:16,994
You really won't tell anybody
me killing all your friends?

1030
01:03:23,667 --> 01:03:27,938
I may be insane,
but I'm not stupid!

1031
01:03:28,038 --> 01:03:30,707
Besides, I need the parts.

1032
01:03:37,047 --> 01:03:37,915
[Screaming]

1033
01:03:38,015 --> 01:03:38,715
Yes.

1034
01:03:41,518 --> 01:03:42,219
TARA: Fucker!

1035
01:03:49,860 --> 01:03:51,962
Now, what are we
gonna do with you?

1036
01:04:30,734 --> 01:04:37,741
Oh... Krissy... Krissy, where
the fuck have you been?

1037
01:04:37,841 --> 01:04:40,710
Krissy, we have to get
the fuck out of here.

1038
01:04:40,810 --> 01:04:44,481
No, Krissy... Krissy,
what are you doing?

1039
01:04:44,581 --> 01:04:45,615
We gotta get the
fuck out of here.

1040
01:04:45,715 --> 01:04:46,616
Come on, let's go.

1041
01:04:46,716 --> 01:04:48,585
Let's get the fuck out of here.

1042
01:04:48,685 --> 01:04:49,753
Krissy, I mean it.

1043
01:04:49,853 --> 01:04:50,554
Come on.

1044
01:04:50,654 --> 01:04:51,922
I'm gonna eat your tits.

1045
01:04:52,022 --> 01:04:53,357

Stay the fuck away from me!

1049
01:05:04,201 --> 01:05:07,071
No... [inaudible].

1050
01:05:10,174 --> 01:05:11,041
Oh my god... no!

Ah... no!

No... fuck you... fuck you!

1068
01:07:15,065 --> 01:07:18,268
Uh, there's a patient who
could use your assistance.

1069
01:07:18,368 --> 01:07:20,170
Mind if I, uh, take a leg?

1070

[Inaudible].

1071
01:07:21,271 --> 01:07:22,672
Let me go!

Oh, well... OK, I'll let
you... I'll let you go,

I'll let you go.

I'll let you go... to hell!

Oh, I'm gonna need
a bigger knife.

You're a fucking
sick motherfucker.

I'm gonna rip your fucking
guts out, you sick fuck!

Yeah!

1080

I... I've never
seen such hostility,

1081
01:07:48,064 --> 01:07:49,933
Especially from a woman.

1082

Jeez, you're a nasty little

[Inaudible], like all
little nasty fleshes,

1086
01:08:02,946 --> 01:08:05,115
Time to cut you up.

1087
01:08:05,215 --> 01:08:06,950
You fucking killed my friends.

01:08:07,050 --> 01:08:09,286
You're fucking
killing us slowly.

You're not a fucking doctor,
you're a fucking psycho!

you look at it, bitch!

You say po-tay-to,
I say po-tah-to!

doing experiments!

Just let me the
fuck out of here.

1098

I'll do anything.

Anything?

01:08:36,946 --> 01:08:38,248
Well, let's start
with the leg, then.

Stop it!

1107
01:08:46,956 --> 01:08:50,560
Did you see the giddy-up
sticks on this bitch over here?

1108
01:08:50,660 --> 01:08:53,763
Oh my fucking god!

Oh, no!

1110
01:08:55,432 --> 01:08:57,967
I was just gonna toss her
out like yesterday's news,

01:08:58,067 --> 01:08:59,636
But I'll tell you what,
that's Shawn Michael's

1120
01:10:35,399 --> 01:10:38,935
Tell you, this is one place
I'd hoped I'd never see again.

1121
01:10:39,035 --> 01:10:40,670
It's that bad, huh?

doctor you were talking about.

No.

1127
01:11:06,296 --> 01:11:08,197
But we'll blame it on him.

1128
01:11:08,298 --> 01:11:09,466
You're my kind of guy.

1129
01:11:09,566 --> 01:11:10,634

All right.
We'll take care of it.

Stand up, Cage.

You've got two choices.

1149

Choice one, you help me protect
the doctor and his experiments
